STARTED. I LIKE TO START BY WELCOMING ALL OF YOU TO OUR NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEES INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS CCPA FOR SHORT. LET ME ALSO BEGIN BY THANKING ALL OF THE PANELISTS -- FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION HERE TODAY. I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES TO JOIN US -- AND WE TRULY AND GREATLY APPRECIATE IT DOWN. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY FELLOW MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. AND EVERYONE HERE IN ATTENDANCE OR TUNING IN ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TOPIC. LAST YEAR I HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY COLLEAGUE SO SENATORS PITTSBURGH AND DOT ON AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT HAS GIVEN ME GREAT CONCERN FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I EAT DATA PRIVACY. A BIG PART OF THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO REACH DOT. LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION WAS BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF A MISTER ALISTAIR MAKE THAGARD WHO'S HERE TODAY. AND THE WHO HAD A PRIVACY INITIATIVE FOR SINCE CONSIDERATION ON A TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALLOT. ON THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER. AND TOGETHER WITH THE THE VALUABLE INPUT OF MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE WERE ABLE TO ENACT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. A WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY RIGHTS LAW IN THE NATION. I FELT DAN AND I STILL FEEL NOW THAT AT ITS CORE THE CCPA IS PREMISED ON A RELATIVELY SIMPLE CONCEPT. IT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL DATA. AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR EXERCISING THAT RIGHT. IF THE BUSINESS ONCE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHILE SERVING ALL THE WAY UP. AND THEN USE IT FOR REASONS OF THEY'RE ALL. LIKE PROVIDING A SERVICE OR SELL SHOULD ASK YOUR PERMISSION FIRST. BECAUSE IT IS YOUR DATA YOUR PRIVACY IT'S YOUR CHOICE. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE PC CPA ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHT WE HAVE TURNED TO CLEAN UP AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. WITH THE HELP OF THE SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. OF COURSE RECOGNIZING THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE NEEDED INTO THE FUTURE I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THROUGH LEADERSHIP. WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH HOUSES. AND SEPARATELY BY THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WE WERE ABLE TO DRESS DRAFTING ERRORS AND BRING CLARITY TO THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. NEWSPAPERS AND VARIOUS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THAT BEING SAID BASED ON CONVERSATION OF OUR TEAM HAS HAD WITH BOTH BUSINESS AND PRIVACY GROUPS. A SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE LAW IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE YET. THIS HEARING TODAY IS IN RECOGNITION OF THAT VERY FACT. I KNOW FIRST BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS. BUSINESSES LEGISLATIVE STAFF IN INCOMING LEGISLATORS HAVE A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS THAT WE WANT FOR CALIFORNIANS LAST YEAR. AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATIONS THAT IS C. C. P. A. IMPOSES FOR BUSINESSES. ONCE WE HAVE DONE THAT IS IT IS JUST AS CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE OUR WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW IS RE FINE TRUE TO OUR INTENT. SO THAT THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WE FOUGHT AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMERS AND ALSO THAT BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE LAW AND PRACTICE. IT IS EASY TO FALL INTO THE TRAP OF TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES -- WOOD BUSINESS AND TECH ON ONE SIDE AND CONSUMER AND PRIVACY GROUPS ON THE OTHER BUT I HOPE WE CAN AVOID THE TYPES OF THESE TYPES OF PRE JUDGMENTS. ALL WHILE I'M SURE WE CAN FIND AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS PLENTY OF COMMON GROUND TO STAND ON AND HOLD FOR CONSENSUS BUILDING INTO THE NEAR FUTURE. MY GOAL FOR THIS HEARING IS TO DELVE INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MY OFFICE AND LIKELY MANY OF OUR YOUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. AND TO UNCOVER COMMON GROUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL WORK THAT MAY EXIST. AND WERE THE NEXT BIG POLICY QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES -- MIGHT LIE. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE -- TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE SEEING A BIT MORE CCPA. CLEAN UP ALL LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO MAKE IT KNOWN AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE THAT I EXPECT TO AUTHORS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK COLLECTIVELY AND BILL AS MUCH CONSENSUS AS POSSIBLE. ON ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT BRING THAT THEY BRING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. IN OBVIOUSLY IT'S MY HOPE THAT FOLKS WILL. ALL THE IMPORTANT RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR CALIFORNIANS IN THE NAME OF CLEAN UP WILL CLARITY. WE MUST SAFEGUARD THOSE RIGHTS AND I WILL LOOK TO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN ME IN THAT ARE. FOR I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WORK TOGETHER AND WORKED DILIGENTLY. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THERE WILL BE WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SURGICAL SIZE AND DO NOT ROLL BACK TO RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS THAT'S DALGLISH BY CCPA. AND I'M ALSO HOPEFUL THAT THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY CAN SERVE AS A STEP IN THOSE. EFFORTS TO FIND COMMONALITY FOR FUTURE WORK AND TO IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT DO NOT YET WARRANT LEGISLATION. WITHOUT I LOOK FOR TO OUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. AND TURNED OUT TO MY FELLOW MEMBERS FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS THAT THEY LIKE TO MAKE AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. MR OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M VERY PROUD THAT THE EFFORT TO PASS A CCPA LAST YEAR WAS BOTH A BICAMERAL EFFORT ANY BI PARTISAN EFFORT. WE WERE FORCED TO DO SO ON A VERY ABBREVIATED TIME FRAME AND THEREFORE WE KNEW THAT THE LEGISLATION WAS GONNA REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CLEAN UP AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS EFFORT IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS YEAR -- BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE NOT A MONTHS LONG EFFORT BUT A YEARS LONG EFFORT -- TO CLAR WAY THROUGH THIS VERY COMPLICATED POLICY FIELD BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE SOME PERSEVERANCE AND US SOME HARD WORK WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH CHAMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO GET THAT DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AT THIS TIME -- LET ME WELCOME THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES -- TO THIS -- HEARING TODAY -- WE ALSO -- MEMBERS -- ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BUFFY WAKES AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- AND SMITH ADJOINING AS A WELCOME TO OUR COMMUNITY. SO IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS LET'S START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. AND I LIKE TO RESERVE ALL THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF EACH PANEL. ARM NOW THOUGH I LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANELIST WHO ARE HERE TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE C. C. P. A. N. THE G. D. P. R.. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY FOUR PANELISTS OFFICE OF ALL MISTER ALISTAIR MACTAGGART WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY. ALL WE ALSO HAVE MISTER JAMES HARRIS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE RAM COAL -- TO HANSON IN PURCELL -- WE ALSO HAVE A RUNNING COME OUT REAL CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER WITH SQUARE AND TANYA FOR SHE PARTNER AND PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY GROUP CHAIR. FRANK FOR DARKER KNIT CLIENT INSULTS. AYE AND FEEL FREE TO CORRECT MY PRONUNCIATION OF YOUR NAME SO SO WITH WE'LL START WITH MR MCTAGGART WELCOME MISTER MCTAGGART. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME'S ULTIMATE TAGGER I COME TO YOU IS THE CHAIRMAN OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY. I COME TO YOU WE'LL GO OVER -- THEY COME TO YOU -- AS A PERSON BUT THE BALLOT MEASURE TOGETHER -- LAST YEAR THE RESULT IN THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. ONE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE AND SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS TIME. WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED PEOPLE ASK ME WHY WHY WAS TWENTY SO MUCH TIME ON THIS AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW? WHY SHOULD I BE INTERESTED WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THIS? AND MY POINT IS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS EXPLODING AND IT'S PERVASIVE. AND WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAIL WITH THE TWENTIES TECHNOLOGIES IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WORKING CONSTANTLY MONITORED TRACKED. JUST THINK OF CARS THEY KNOW WHAT TIME TO GET TO WORK WHAT TIME YOU LEAVE WORK THEN HOW MUCH YOU WEIGH. KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU GO TO A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OR TO THE GYM AND HOW LONG YOU STAY THERE. THIS INFORMATION IS VALUABLE HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR LIFE INSURANCE. WE LIVE IN AN ERA OF COMMERCIAL SURVEILLANCE AND BUT I LIKE TO SAY. YOU KNOW STANDARD WILL WITH THE MOST POWERFUL CORPORATION IN ITS DAY BUT IT DIDN'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. AND SO I WANT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WOULD LEAD ME TO INITIATIVE. DESPITE ALL THE COMMENTARY THAT THAT THIS WAS. TO PLACE IN IN A VERY SHORT REPEATED TIMES ACTUAL ARCHITECTURE. THE THE LAW TO TAKE PLACE QUICKLY BUT THE ARCHITECTURE TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF RESEARCH OF ME GOING AROUND -- AND THAT LED US TO THE INITIATIVE WHICH MISTER HARRISON -- DRAFTED MANY TIMES IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE ENDED UP GETTING OUR SIGNATURES IT BEGINNING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FUN FACT WE ENDED UP WITH MORE CALIFORNIANS SIGNING THE PETITION. THAN LIVE WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN VERMONT -- WYOMING -- AND WHAT WE GOT OUR FIGURES -- SIGNATURES -- IN -- MAY I WAS CONTACTED BY THE MEMBERS LEGISLATURE UP YOUR CHAIR WORK WITH BOTH OF THEM CLOSELY. AND FOR MAY AND JUNE SPEND ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME -- HERE IN NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. AND THEY'RE BUILT THAT ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUMMER PRIVACY ACTORS HE PICTURES OF BOTH MEMBERS INTRODUCING IN THE RESPECTIVE HOUSES. AND OF COMMENT THAT IT WAS A BY CAROL BIPARTISAN ISSUE AT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN MY LIFE IS SEEING THAT THIS PASS OUT OF BOTH HOUSES UNANIMOUSLY. DID AGAIN IN AUGUST AND WILL SOME OF SAID LOOK I WAS JUST BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WAS TRYING TO GET INITIATIVE OFF THE BALLOT. I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE LEGISLATORS ARE SMART AND UNDERSTAND WHEN ISSUE HAS ARRIVED. AND THEY WANT TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY ON THIS VOTE -- SO WHAT DOES HE SHOULD BE I ACTUALLY DID. I I ONE OF THREE MAIN THINGS FOR IT TO DO THE FIRST WAS I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT COMPANIES KNEW ABOUT ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION EIGHT HOW CAN I GET THAT. THAT -- THAT INFORMATION SO WE CALL THAT THE RIGHT TO KNOW. THE SECOND IS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL NOT TO SELL THIS INFORMATION THE COMPANY THEY NEVER HEARD OF AROUND THE WORLD WHICH HAPPENS RIGHT NOW AND SO. THIS IS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO. AND THEN THE THIRD IS LOOKING GONNA CLICK MY INFORMATION FOR GONNA SAY KEEP IT SAFE -- DON'T MAKE ME A VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT AND SO THAT WAS THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR COMMISSION KEPT SECURE. SO WHO'S COVERED -- FOR US IT'S ONLY IT'S ONLY LARGE BUSINESSES A LOT OF YOUR INFORMATION WE DIDN'T THINK THE PROBLEM WAS WITH MOM AND POPS WITH NON PROFITS WITH GOVERNMENT SO WE WE WHICH REALLY ONLY COVERING. THAT LIMITED SUBSET. IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH IT. SO YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE D. P. R. WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT -- LAST YEAR ANOTHER PRIVACY LAW. THEY RELY WHAT'S CALLED NOTICE AND CONSENT AND THAT IS -- A WITH A WITH A WHERE THEY HAVE TO GET YOUR CONCEPT FOR THE PROCESS INFORMATION IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN UP EUROPEAN WEBSITE YOU SEE A POP UP SAYING YOU KNOW PRINT THAT A COOKIE COMMITTED IS NOW. WE I THINK TAKEN MORE AMERICAN APPROACH WHICH IS -- WE GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE. NOT A REQUIREMENT WE GIVE YOU THE CHOICE TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR INFORMATION -- SOME ISSUES WITH NO TO THINK THAT WHICH I CAN GO TO LATER IF YOU'D LIKE -- AT OUR CHOICE WE WE WE ENABLE THAT BY HAVING THE REQUIREMENT FOR A DO NOT SELL BUTTON ON ON A WEBSITE FOR YOU JUST CLICK IT IS THEY DON'T SOME INFORMATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY AND I'VE TALKED WEB BROWSING COMPANIES ABOUT THIS AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL DO THIS -- WE REQUIRE WEBSITES FOR COMPANIES TO OFFER A THIRD PARTY OPT OUT. AND WHAT THAT MEAN IS THAT THAT. YOU GO TO A WITH WHAT WE THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN TO WEB BROWSERS WILL IN FORGET INCIDENT THAT AND FORGET IT AND THEN EVERY TIME YOU VISIT ANY WEBSITE IT WILL SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE WEBSITE DON'T SELL THIS PERSON'S INFORMATION. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART ABOUT THAT CITY PA -- WE PERMIT AT THAT THE ACT FROM ITS ADVERTISING -- WOULDN'T WANT TO KILL INTERNET -- ADVERTISING DOES SUPPORT INTERNET BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE IMPOSED IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING. WHERE WE DON'T PERMIT THAT RESELLING OF YOUR INFORMATION RIGHT NOW GENERALLY YOU SEE AN AD? YOUR INFORMATION'S BEEN AUCTIONED OFF IN REAL TIME DID AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND COMPANIES HAVE SEEN THAT INFORMATION IN MANY CASES RETAIN THAT INFORMATION. SO WE PUT IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THAT INFORMATION AFTER THE HAS BEEN PLACED. WE OFFER ADDITIONAL RIGHT SINCE HE'S PA THE RIGHT TO DELETE YOUR INFORMATION NOW THAT'S A YOU AS AN AMERICAN RIGHT NOT A EUROPEAN RIGHT SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN. EXISTS IN IN IN EUROPE BUT IT IS THE RIGHT TO THE INFORMATION YOU'VE GIVEN THE COMPANY -- YOU'VE DISCLOSURE POSTED YOU CAN YOU CAN DELETE. WE INCREASED PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN -- RIGHT NOW -- FROM THIRTEEN UP TO SIXTEEN THE COMPANY HAS TO GET THE CHILD'S -- PERMISSION BEFORE CONSULT INFORMATION THAT'S OFTEN AS OPPOSED TO OPT OUT. AND THEN WE SAY PORTLY THAT COMPANIES CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU IF YOU CHOOSE. PRIVACY SO YOU SAY DON'T SOMEONE INFORMATION FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH BILL YOU KNOW FROM YOUR CELL PHONE COMPANY BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE YOUR GEOLOCATION SOLD. IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT -- WE GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE MOST OF THE ACT. BUT WE DO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS CONSUMER FORSMAN FOR NEGLIGENT DATA REGION THIS IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT FOR FOR A SECOND BECAUSE BY RIGHT ACTIONS GOT A LOT OF PRESS. AND YET I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE COMPANY'S DOING ITS BEST. AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKS INTO IT AND THEN THE COMPANY HAS IT HAS A HUGE ISSUE. AND SO WE GIVE THIRTY THREE SAFE HARBORS COULD REFINANCE SET GOOD BEHAVIOR. AS A COMPANIES THAT ENCRYPT YOUR DATA. THE REDACTOR DATA I MEAN STICK YOUR NAME OUT OF THE DATA SET WHERE THAT ACTUALLY JUST OF REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES IN PLACE DON'T FACE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT OTHERWISE -- OTHERWISE YOU KNOW WITH THE COMPANY'S NEGLIGENT WITH YOUR DATA. AND THE AND AND I I I HAVE THIS ANALOGY OF A BANK THAT. NOT ONLY DOESN'T WALK IT OR DOESN'T SHUT THE DOOR THOSE COMPANIES WERE TRYING TO SAY HEY LOOK YOU GOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO PEOPLE'S INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT. SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US NOW. I THINK IF YOU LOOK IN IN IN HIS STARK CIRCLE CONTACT WHERE WE ARE WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY. THINK ABOUT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WITH AUTO SAFETY. THINK WHAT THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WITH -- SMOKING AND TOBACCO IN THE RIGHTS FOR THE ANTI SMOKING PROGRAMS. THINK ABOUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH AUTO EMISSIONS. IN EACH CASE SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENT. REALIZE THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND DEMANDED CHANGE AND SET THE INDUSTRY LOOK YOU CAN DO BETTER YOU MUST DO BETTER. IN MANY CASES INDUSTRY. VEHEMENTLY RESISTED AT INITIALLY. AND YET IMAGINE TODAY A WORLD WHERE. WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE. CHANGES HAD BEEN HADN'T HADN'T HAPPENED WE WOULD BE ABLE SEE ACROSS LA ON UP. ON ANY DAY FRANKLY. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW A LOT IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT PRIVACY BEING -- REGULATIONS IN THE DEATH OF INTERNET. YOU KNOW WHAT. IT'S NOT ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE TO DO JUST FINE THERE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT WE THE PEOPLE NEED SOME BASIC RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR INFORMATION IS OUR INFORMATION. I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY CALIFORNIA IS NOW A WORLDWIDE LEADER. IN. THE AREA OF PRIVACY AND WE KNOW THAT DURING THIS NEXT COMING YEAR -- I WAS AWARE WHEN I WITHDREW THE INITIATIVE. THAT -- THAT WOULD OPEN THIS UP TO THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE. BAD AND GOOD I'M WOODS WILL TAKE THE RISK BECAUSE I SHOULD BELIEVE ANY INSTITUTION I BELIEVE YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO A GREAT JOB DEFENDING THIS BILL MAKING SURE THAT WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR. IT'S A GREAT -- BILL FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THE WORLD THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXTEL PANELISTS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING I'M RON MORNING CREW CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER OF SQUARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO LEAD ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF CONSUMER PRIVACY. AS WE CAN TRASCENDENTALES YOU. THE E. U.'S GDP ARE TODAY WE AIM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY HOW SEE CPA'S IMPLEMENTATION ME IMPACTED COMPANIES SUCH AS SQUARE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT THE MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE SERVE. IN WHILE CPA'S IT'S INTENDED TO REGULATE THEM. PARTS OF IT FOR EXAMPLE THE FIFTY THOUSAND DEVICE A YEAR. BET CAN AND DOES IMPACT MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT. FOR EXAMPLE. A CRITICAL WAY THAT WE BUSINESSES IS TO PREVENT PRESENT PREVENTIVE RISK AND FRAUD WHICH RELIES ON A NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF CUSTOMER IN BUSINESS DATA. RESPONSIBLE USES OF DATA ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL TO ALLOW US TO PROVIDE OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SUCH AS HELPING THEM PROCESS PAYMENTS RUN THEIR BUSINESS PAY AND PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO GROW. GETTING CBA'S IMPLEMENTATION RATE IS CRITICAL TO PRESERVING THESE CRUCIAL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES. SO I'LL FOCUS IS GUSHING ON THE PARTS OF GDP ARE THAT ARE THE CLOSEST ANALOGUES TO THE NEW RIGHTS YOU GAVE CALIFORNIANS UNDERSEA CPA. SO WHAT IS NEEDED GPR DO FIRST IT PROTECTS PERSONAL DATA WHICH IS WHAT THEY CALL PI. AND IT DEFINES THAT AS DATED THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IDENTIFIES A NATURAL PERSON. THIS PROTECTS STATED THAT IDENTIFIES PEOPLE WHILE AVOIDING OVER CAPTURING DATA THAT ARE MERELY KEEP WILL BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM FOR EXAMPLE THE GENDER FEMALE IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH HALF THE HUMAN POPULATION. BUT IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY ANY OF US. IT ALSO EXCLUDES TO DONNA MISER DE IDENTIFIED DATA. BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT THIS TYPE OF DATA DOES NOT BUT IT BY ITSELF IDENTIFY PEOPLE. TO TO PR IS A DEFINITION ALLOWS THE RULES THAT FLOW FROM IT. TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND THE SECURITY OF DATA. THAT IDENTIFY A PERSON. REGARDLESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED. IT ALSO FOSTERS INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN YET IT AVOIDS TRAMPLING ON THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS WHOSE DATA MAY BE COMMINGLED IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICE. WOW SEE CBA'S INTENDED TO MIRROR TEACH YOU TO DO G. DEPART P. R. PRINCIPLES IT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED TO APPLY TO A BROADER SET OF DATA THAN YOU INTENDED. TO AVOID THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT COULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO HELP FURTHER HARMONIZE C. C. P. A.'S DEFINITION OF PI. TO THE GDP OUR DEFINITION OF PERSONAL DATA. SECOND GPR HAS RULES FOR WHEN PI CAN BE USED. LIKE CCPA IT STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING PRIVACY AND GIVING PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR PI WHILE PERMITTING IT TO BE USED AND SHARED FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS PURPOSES. GPR REQUIRES CONSENT WHERE IT MATTERS MOST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THERE IS A SURPRISING OR UNEXPECTED OR NOT REASONABLY ANTICIPATED SALE OF YOUR DATA. JUDY PR DOES NOT HOWEVER REQUIRE CONSENT WHEN A BUSINESS AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS USE DATA TRANSPARENTLY FAIRLY AND BASED ON OTHER LAWFUL REASONS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING BEING A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT. TO FILL A CONTRACT WITH OR TO PROVIDE THIS IS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER. AND IT IN WAYS THAT ARE OTHERWISE IN A LEGITIMATE INTEREST OF THE BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE TO RUN A LOYALTY OR REWARDS PROGRAM TO BENEFIT THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS. YOU TO PEER ARE YOU. CURTAILS PROBLEMATIC DATA SALES BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE DOES NOT PROVIDE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE TO DISCLOSURES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS PURPOSES. WE COMMEND YOU FOR STRIKING A SIMILARLY THOUGHTFUL BALANCING CCPA. THIRD. GPR GIVES EUROPEAN DATA RIGHTS. AS ALISTAIR MENTIONED UPON A VERIFIABLE REQUEST. EUROPEANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW AN AXIS WITH DATA COMPANY HAS ON THEM HOW IT'S USED AND WHY IN THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM IT SHARED. IT ALSO GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO CORRECT INTO PORT TO TAKE THAT DATA WITH THEM. IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO DELETE DATA WHICH JUST LIKE IN CCPA IS NOT ABSOLUTE. IT IS SUBJECT TO EXEMPTIONS CALIBRATED TO PERMIT LEGITIMATE DATA USES TO CONTINUE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EXEMPTION IT PREVENTS THINGS LIKE A FRAUD STIRS STANDING IN A DAY DELETE ME REQUEST. THAT IS INTENDED TO WEAKEN THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DETECT THEIR FRAUDULENT DEEDS. NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT -- IN ITS BEST TO THE LAST POINT IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN GPRC CBA BEST ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMPLE. SO CONTRARY TO MY BET BEST -- IT TOOK TO MY PRIVACY BACKGROUND I HAVE. YOU KNOW SUBMITTED MY DNA EIGHT IF LEARN MORE ABOUT MY ANCESTRY. THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY COULD TAKE DATA THAT WAS STOLEN FROM ME DURING THE EQUIFAX HACK. INTO DARK NET. USE THAT DATA TO CALL THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER TO PRETEND TO BE ME AND GET A COPY OF MY GENETIC CODE. TERRIFIES ME. G. DPR MITIGATES AGAINST AT RISK. BY NOT DICTATING THE MEANS FOR ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS. BUT SIMPLY IT LEAVES IT UP TO THE BUSINESS TO DETERMINE HOW TO DO THAT. IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW THEY USUALLY INTERACT WITH THE CUSTOMER WHAT THAT DOES. IS ALLOW BUSINESSES TO TAKE A RISK BASED APPROACH TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY KIND OF KNOW THE PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET A COPY OF THE DATA IS YOU. WE HOPE YOU FIND THIS INFORMATION HELPFUL. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF WE CAN BE OF ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT PANELIST PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MORNING WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS TANYA FORESIGHT. AND I AM A PARTNER WITH THE LAW FIRM FRANKFORT KERR NECKLINE AND SELLS CHAIR OF THE FIRM'S PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY GROUP AND I'M BASED IN LOS ANGELES. I THE TIME AND ALSO AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL -- I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SCENE UPRISING DATA SECURITY LAW SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX I AM CERTIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS AS A C. I. P. P. U. S. AND S. T. I. P. T.. I'M AND I'M HERE TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS A PRIVACY LAWYER WHO HAS REPRESENTED HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES IN COMPLYING. WITH PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY RELATED MATTERS I AM NOT HERE REPRESENTING ANY PARTICULAR CLIENT. I'M HERE ON THIS PANEL TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME IMPORTANT BACKGROUND. ON THE BURDENS AND CHALLENGES THAT COMPANIES FACE AND COMPLYING WITH OR ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH THE EUROPEAN GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THE GDP ARE THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS MORNING SO FAR. SO THE GPR HAS EXTRA TERRITORIAL APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE. THREE SO THAT MEANS THAT COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESSES DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHO ARE OFFERING GOODS OR SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOCATED IN THE EEO AND THAT'S THE TASK UNDER GPR IT'S NOT BASED ON RESIDENCY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHERE ARE THEY LOCATED. SO FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES OFFERING GOODS OR SERVICES TO AN INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE E. U. THEY ARE ALREADY TODAY REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE G. P. R.. AND THEY HAD TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PREPARE FOR AND COMPLY WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY. THEY CALL THEM DATA SUBJECTS UNDER THE GPR BUT THOSE ARE CONSUMERS WHEN YOU HEAR TALK ABOUT DATA SUBJECTS THAT'S WHAT THAT IS. SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO PREPARE INTO COMPLY WITH G. P. ARE YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S CALLED DATA MAPPING OR DATA INVENTORY IN ORDER KNOW WHAT DATA YOU HAVE IN THAT IT CANNOT BE FULLY AUTOMATED YOU HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OF THE BUSINESS UNITS AND IT. AND OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY THAT CAN BE A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING. YOU HAVE TO UPDATE ALL YOUR CONTRACTS WITH YOUR SERVICE PROVIDERS YOU MUST AND THAT REQUIRES LEGAL COUNSEL. YOU MUST UPDATE YOUR PRIVACY POLICIES THAT ALSO REQUIRES LEGAL ADVICE. YOU HAVE TO SET UP AS YOU WERE HEARING -- FROM PRIOR WITNESSES YOU MUST SET UP A MECHANISM FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS. TO MAKE REQUESTS DELETE FOR PORTABILITY -- TO HAVE ACCESS AND TO EXERCISE THEIR OTHER RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW AND YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOUR PERSONAL. IF THIS IS DONE CORRECTLY UNDER THE GPR IT INVOLVES VERY EXTENSIVE IN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TIME AND RESOURCES. PERSONNEL I. T. AT SARAH IT REUIRES EITHER NEW HIRES OR DIVERTING PERSONNEL AWAY FROM THERE. EXISTING PERSON WELL PERSON AWAY FROM THEIR REGULAR JOBS TO DO. BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY SPENDS ANYWHERE FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PREPARING FOR THE GED PR AND COMPLYING WITH IT SINCE IT TOOK A FACT MAY TWENTY FIFTH -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO CSO MAGAZINE 88% OF COMPANIES SPENT MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- PREPARING FOR GPR. THE GDP ARE DOES NOT HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- IT ALLOWS THE E. REGULATORS WHO ARE CALLED THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NAMES AND EVERY COUNTRY -- TO ENFORCE IT IT DOES ALLOW A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION SAY BY AN ADVOCACY GROUP ON BEHALF OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT HAVE STATUTORY DAMAGES -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE WITHOUT ANY SHOWING OF HARM. IT BECAME LAW THE PAIR BECAME LAW ON APRIL TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT HE DID NOT -- TAKE A FACT ENFORCEMENT DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL MAY TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO BUSINESSES HAD MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO START THE PROCESS AND ACTUALLY EVEN LONGER BECAUSE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN WHICH THE JEEP. WAS ENACTED TO REPLACE THE OLD DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE WITH ONGOING FOR MANY YEARS AS WELL. BUT AT LEAST TWO YEARS. TO UNDERTAKE THAT EXPENSE AND BURDEN TO PREPARE -- DESPITE THAT DESPITE THAT MANY IF NOT MOST U. S. COMPANIES ARE STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE GPR. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING -- ACCORDING TO A CAP GEMINI I SURVEY THAT WAS RELEASED ONE WEEK BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE IN MAY. 85% OF FIRMS IN EUROPE S. WE'RE NOT READY TO FULLY COMPLY WHEN IT TOOK A FACT AND BY THE END OF THE YEAR ONE IN FOUR WE'RE STILL NOT. COMPLY. CZ PA IS EVEN MORE COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING FOR REASONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT LATER TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE EVEN INCLUSION OF THE WORD HOUSEHOLD IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE GT PR CHANGES THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF COMPLIANCE. AS A CONSEQUENCE DESPITE HAVING DONE SIGNIFICANT WORK FOR DUTY ARE. COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT READY FOR CCPA. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND I SHOULD TAKE COMPANIES ALL COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED MANY BUSINESSES WILL HAVE TO REINVENT THEIR COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. FORTY CPA WITH AN EVEN SHORTER TIME LINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THIS EASY PAY BECAME LAW ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH AS YOU KNOW WAS ARGUMENT IT ONCE IN SEPTEMBER AND IT WILL CURRENTLY IS SIDE TAKE EFFECT JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY SO EXPERIENCE WITH THE GPR HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME CHANGES TO THE C. T. C. TVA AND TO THE TIMELINE. IN ORDER FOR COMPLIANCE TO BE REALISTIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS VERY MUCH A NECK SO LET'S -- OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] GO AHEAD. THIS GALLAGHER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING -- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THAT WE STE SHE'S IN INVOLVED -- I DO WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WHEN WE PASS THE CPC CPA I THOUGHT IT WAS A LANDMARK -- THING FOR US TO DO -- MUCH NEEDED PROBABLY OF A LONG TIME IN COMING -- AND AND I WOULD POINT OUT AS AS MISTER MCTAGGART POINTED BROUGHT UP THIS IS THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT -- YOU KNOW TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROCESS OF PAY IN ADDITION TO BEING ON THE BALLOT WELL WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES NOW. AND IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT PROCESS BEING USED IN WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE SLEEVE THAT THEIR HOWEVER THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS WAS ALSO BUT WE HAD BRIEFINGS. ON THIS LEGISLATION -- IN AS AS MISTER MCTAGGART SAID TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF RESEARCH THAT WENT INTO -- THE YOU KNOW THE THE LEGISLATION ITSELF AND DRAFTING -- YOU KNOW I I DO SEE THAT THERE MAY BE ISSUES WHERE WE NEED TO CLARIFY YOU KNOW FOR BUSINESS AND SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO BE. COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY MUCH ON GUARD AGAINST IS MAYBE THINGS THAT AVAIL DOES THAT. BUT ARE REALLY SEEKING TO TRY AND UNDERMINE THE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS. GRANTED BY THE CCPA. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY -- I THINK THE I JUST FIND IT A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT THE REAL CONCERN IS ABOUT FRAUDSTERS CALLING IN AND TRYING TO GET. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN A LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES HAVE SO MUCH INFORMATION HAVE THINGS IN PLACE THAT THEY KNOW MORE. YEAH ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS -- THEN MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THEY DO -- AND HAVE GUARDS AND CHECKED ENSURE THAT THE PERSON IS. WHO THEY'RE SAYING THEY ARE WHAT PEOPLE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY THREE IN ME AND SENDING IN YOUR DNA? IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY COMES IN AND BUYS A LOT OF SHARES IN THE IN THE COMPANY. AND THE CONCERN IS OKAY IS THAT DATA NOW AND FIND OUT ABOUT MY ANCESTRY BUT NAY FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PERMISSION THAT I GAVE WHEN I WHEN I VOLUNTARILY GAVE -- THAT DATA AND SO TO ME LIKE WHAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT STE CERTAINLY WE WANT TO PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD AND IN PEOPLE ABUSING THE SYSTEM -- FOR SURE BUT I THINK THE BIGGER CONCERN AND THREAT OUT THERE FROM THE PUBLIC IS THAT THEIR DATA IS BEING USED IN WAYS THAT THEY NEVER GAVE PERMISSION. TO USE AND IS BEING MONETIZE IN WAYS THAT THEY NEVER GAVE. PERMISSION -- AND SO TO ME THAT IS A BIGGER UP FRONT FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING THING THAT WE WOULD WE WANT TO ABSOLUTELY PROTECT -- YOU KNOW AS WE ARE AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE ALWAYS LOOKING AT OUR LAWS AND SAYING HEY HOW. HOW DOES THIS REALLY WORK FOR THE DAY AND AGE THAT WE LIVE IN -- I WOULD SAY THAT ABOUT A WHOLE HOST TO LAWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BY THE WAY I'M IN I'M IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. VERY REGULATED INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ON ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS THAT ARE VERY BURDENSOME I'LL TELL YOU -- AND LARGELY THIS THIS SPACE THOUGH IT IS REGULATED IS. HAS NOT BEEN REGULATED IN THE SAME WAY AND SO I CAN TELL YOU FROM PEOPLE WHO OPERATE IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES -- IN A WAY IT DOES SEEM LIKE. THE YOU KNOW -- LOTS OF REGULATION FOR US AND KIND OF LIKE HEY YOU GUYS GO AHEAD AND AND KIND OF DO WHATEVER YOU WANT -- AND TO ME THAT'S WHY CCPA WITH SO MUCH NEEDED SO THAT HEY WE'RE YES THIS IS NEW. YES IT IS PROVIDING A LOT OF PROSPERITY -- IN IN. BREAKTHROUGHS THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM. AND AND WE AND WE VERY MUCH NEED THIS INDUSTRY BUT IN THIS SPACE WE ALSO. JUST LIKE WE HAVE AT THE HISTORY OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NEEDED TO DOUBLE REGULATION TO ENSURE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND SO. YOU KNOW AS AS WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THOSE SHOULD BE. YES OF OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR HOLDEN HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GALLAGHER OTHER ANY ADDITIONAL CUTS -- YES GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. I WAS NOT HERE LAST YEAR DURING ALL THESE DISCUSSIONS BUT THEY SEEMED -- VERY INTERESTING -- MR MAKE TIRED I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU -- IN YOUR PURSUIT -- TO PUSH FOR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WHICH I THINK IS MUCH NEEDED -- DID YOU EVER CONSIDER PUSHING FOR MAYBE DID YOU PUSH AND FOR AN OFTEN AS OPPOSED TO AN OPT OUT. THANK YOU -- YES -- WE DID AND ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY WAS CRAFTED AS OFTEN VERSUS OPT OUT THERE THERE TO TURN THE OTHER NUMBER ISSUES AROUND -- OPT OUT AND OFTEN SO -- DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO ONCE BEEN A BIT BUT ESSENTIALLY -- THERE ARE THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE BODY OF LAW OF RESTRICTING COMMERCIAL SPEECH WHICH IS A LOWER THRESHOLD. SO THERE IS A VERMONT CASE I MISTER CICERO AND THIS IS PART OF MY EDUCATION WHEN I WHEN I GOT -- ADVICE FROM A VERY WELL RESPECTED -- PRIVACY PROFESSIONAL -- HERE IN THE STATE CHRIS TO FINAGLE WHO SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IF WE WENT WELL THOUGHT IN. WE WOULD PUT THE LAW AT RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE SUPREME COURT DECISION -- WHICH WAS A VERMONT -- CASE WHERE THEY RESTRICTED THIS WHERE WE'RE AT VERMONT PASS A LAW RESTRICTING THE SALE OF PHARMACY PRESCRIBER INFORMATION -- TO DRUG MARKETING COMPANIES AND WHAT TO THE SUPREME COURT CASE IT'S REACHED RECORD. CONTRAST THAT WITH THE DO NOT CALL LEGISLATION WHERE YOU CAN YOU KNOW SAY DON'T DON'T CALL ME -- THAT ALSO WHAT'S REPORT THAT WAS HELD TO BE RESTRICTIONS COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND SO. THE IDEA THAT YOU MAKE THE CONSUMER DO SOMETHING HAVE OPT OUT AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVE A BLANKET RESTRICTION ON COMPANIES. WAS -- ACCORDING TO PRESERVE NAGLE WAS WITH -- A CHALLENGE EVENTUALLY AT THE COURT. AND I WAS THE ALSO THE MORE WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE IT SEEMS LIKE. IN THE EUROPEAN WORLD WITH THE NOTICE AND CONSENT YOU'VE COUPLE ISSUES -- ONE YOU GET THREE CONSENT FIFTY KEEPING HIM THE POP UPS YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW BUT NOW -- SECONDLY IT THERE'S A CHILLING EFFECT POTENTIALLY ON INNOVATION IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY LIKELY TO GIVE YOUR PERMISSION. TO THE COMPANY THAT YOU HEARD OF THE FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE BUT AT A NEW INNOVATOR A NEW COMPANY NEVER HEARD OF YOU MIGHT SAY NO YOU CAN'T CLICK MY INFORMATION. SO THEIR NUMBER ISSUES AROUND NOTICING CONSENT THE EUROPEAN THING AND SO WHERE. ALSO BECAUSE WE PROVIDE THAT THIRD PARTY OPT OUT WE THINK WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS MOST PEOPLE JUST GONNA SET IT IN THEIR BROTHER ONCE AND FORGET JUST ON SOME INFORMATION AND WILL BE VERY SEAMLESS. AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME RIGHT SO THE WHEN WOMEN OFTEN THOUGH PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIONS. ALSO FOR FOR CHILDREN -- UNDER SIXTY NOW FROM THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN BEFORE THIRTY NOW IT'S GONNA BE SIXTEEN WITH THIS LAW. IT DOES BY PROTECTIONS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AGAIN IS IS -- YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT FRAME DIFFERENT WORLD WITH A DIFFERENT SET FLAWS -- THAN IN EUROPE AND SO -- I I MY APPROACH AS I WENT THROUGH THIS WAS TRYING NOT. TO AND I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS BUT TO GO TO THE EXPERTS AND CHOOSE THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST THE MOST AND THAT THIS APPROACH SEEMED. FROM THE PEOPLE I TALK TO HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR THEIR LIFETIME SO WE DON'T THEIR WORKING LIKE TIME SEEMS TO BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR THIS COUNTRY GIVEN THE FRAMEWORK WE LIVE IN SO -- THAT'S THAT'S WHEN WE CHOSE OKAY THANK YOU. THANKS MUCH MISTER IRWIN. THANK YOU AND THIS IS AREALLY IMPORTANT -- DISCUSSION TODAY BECAUSE AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I YOU KNOW IT IT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THE NATION ON THIS BUT WE ALSO MAKE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. AND UP WITH MODEL LEGISLATION THAT THE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CAN FOLLOW AND AND OF THEIR AT WHEN I WAS AT THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES -- A NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES OR WAS A BIG DISCUSSION AS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT A FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND AND I THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. THAT GETS IT RIGHT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OF OUR RESIDENTS. AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T BRING EVERYTHING TO A GRINDING HALT SO -- I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK SOME OF IT IS JUST GOING TO REQUIRE CLARIFICATION ALONG THE WAY AND ONE OF THE THINGS WAS -- THE SLIDE THAT CAME UP EARLY ON ABOUT THE THREE SAFE HARBORS AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT. DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALL THREE OF THEM OR IS IT EITHER ENCRYPTION REDACTION OR REASONABLE SECURITY AND THEN -- MAYBE YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO ME HOW WE DETERMINE WHAT REASONABLE SECURITY AS THANK YOU. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S ANY OF THEM -- IT'S NOT ALL INTENDED TO BE ALL -- THREE AND SO THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW FROM -- WELL BEFORE TCPA REQUIRED COMPANIES TO COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO HAVE THE REASONABLE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE AT THE NAY THE INFORMATION -- IT. AND SO WE REFERENCE THAT THAT'S THE AT THE PARK THE PROBLEM PREVIOUSLY WAS THERE WERE NO TEETH AND THERE WERE CERTAIN NO CONSEQUENCES -- YOU KNOW I THINK CANDIDLY THAT COMPANIES WILL WANT CERTAINTY SO FIGHT CRYPT LEAST AT THE THRESHOLD OF DONE. AND BASICALLY THINK ABOUT A CHRISTIAN THIS IS OFF THE SHELF TECHNOLOGY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW -- LETTING SOMEONE ON THE MOVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST YOU CAN BE ANYBODY CAN AND SHOULD ESPECIALLY BIG COMPANIES SHE CAN AND SHOULD BE ENCRYPTING THE DATA. SO THAT IT IS A VERY CHEAP WILL MEASURE FOR REJECT THE DATA TAKING THE PEOPLE'S NAMES OUT OF THE CONSUMERS NAMES AT THE DATA SAID -- BUT ALSO -- THERE'S A THIRD OPTION BECAUSE WE WANT TO REFERENCE EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW BUT ANY OF THOSE -- THREE WILL BE OKAY THANK YOU AND I BY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO WORK TOGETHER AND THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION AND IS IT -- THIS. FORTY FOUR FOUR YOU TALKED ABOUT -- INITIALLY 85% OF THE COMPANY'S WEREN'T READY FOR A G. P. R.. AND NOW IT'S 25% I'D ACTUALLY HEARD STATISTICS THAT WERE THAT -- THAT WE ONLY HAVE 40% THAT ARE ACTUALLY OUR GDP ARE COMPLIANT SO -- IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES. SO THAT FIGURE CAME WAS SUPPOSED TO COVER BOTH THAT YOU AND THE US IT WAS FROM I THINK I SAID CSO MAGAZINE IS WHERE THAT STATISTIC CAME FROM I MEAN TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU IN MY EXPERIENCE. AS A PRACTITIONER. I SEE ALMOST NO COMPANIES THAT ARE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL FULLY COMPLIANT I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY SUCH A THING. TO BE HONEST AS FULLY COMPLIANT AND I DON'T LIKE IT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I SEE -- VENDORS THAT SELL SERVICES VENDORS ARE TECHNOLOGY VENDORS THAT COME OUT AND SAY OH WILL HELP MAKE YOU 1100% GPR COMPLIANT JUST LIKE I DON'T LIKE THAT WITH ANY OTHER KIND OF SALE THAT ALLEGEDLY IS GONNA MAKE YOU IT'S A PROCESS IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS IT'S NOT JUST A POINT IN TIME WHERE YOU CHECK ALL THESE BOXES AND YOU SAY -- OR DONE THERE ARE SOME STANDARDS OUT THERE LIKE THAT LIKE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY STANDARD -- WHICH IS BEING CRITICIZED QUITE A LOT BY THOSE IN THE INFORMATION'S KURT SECURITY WORLD BECAUSE IT'S A CHECK THE BOX APPROACH AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EAN ANYTHING. YOU CAN CHECK ALL THOSE BOXES ONE MINUTE AND THEN THE NEXT MINUTE. MAYBE DON'T HAVE REASONABLE SECURITY MORE BECAUSE THE BAD GUYS ARE IN AGAIN RIGHT. SIMILARLY WITH JUDY PR -- LET'S TALK ABOUT LIKE THOSE FAKE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WHICH DO HAPPEN THEY REALLY DO HAPPEN THERE'S A GREAT ARTICLE THAT IS OUT THERE WITH THE I. P. ABOUT FAKE DATA SUBJECT REQUESTS THAT YOU CAN FIND ON THEIR BLOG -- THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING UNDER GPR HOW CAN YOU BE COMPLIANCE IF WHEN WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU AND ALL YOU HAVE IS THEY GIVE YOU THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS AND SAY. I WANT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ABOUT ME AND I. P. ADDRESSES AND IN YOU KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT WEB BROWSING BEHAVIORS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THAT. YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT BASED ON JUST WHAT SOMEBODY'S EMAIL IS IN THEY COULD BE USING SOMEONE ELSE'S EMAIL BUT IF YOU ASK THEM TO VERIFY. GIVE ME SOME SORT OF IDENTIFICATION FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO GIVE YOU MORE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT'S NOT PRIVACY PROTECTIVE. SECONDLY THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE A TEO DO THAT DON'T ASK THEM FOR VERIFICATION SO IT IS TRUE WE ARE SEEN FRAUDULENT FAKE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION HOW CAN ANY COMPANY POSSIBLY BE. G. P. R. COMPLIANT UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN TO CHEAP SO I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THE STATISTICS ARE MUCH LOWER. AND THAT MAYBE ONLY THE VERY LARGEST COMPANIES WITH THE VERY LARGEST BUDGETS FOR THIS KIND OF THING HAVE ACHIEVED ANYTHING CLOSE TO GPR COMPLIANCE -- AND I THINK THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN IS SOMETHING THAT'S PROBLEM AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN CCPA BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A FOR MANY COMPANIES IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE -- TO TO COMPLY WITH -- AND I SAID I DO NOT THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE I'M NOT CLEAR ON WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISM IN THE UNITED STATES FOR GDP ARE RIGHT SO-- THE EUROPEAN REGULATORS AND LIKE I SAID THERE'S THIS EXTRA TERRITORIAL APPLICATION PROVISION. IN THE GPR THAT ALLOWS THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES IN YOUR IN EUROPE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST US COMPANIES. OR OR AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST US COMPANIES THAT ARE EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT'S CALLED ESTABLISHMENT IN EUROPE SO EVEN IF NO OFFICE. EVEN IF NO PERSONNEL THIS IS WHAT CHANGED UNDER GPR NOW IF I'M HERE IN THE U. S. BUT I AM ACTIVELY OFFERING MY SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE EO. THEN. THEY GET ME THEY THEY SAY THEY CAN PULL ME AND AND THEY CAN EXERT THEIR AUTHORITY OVER ME NOW ARE WE GONNA SEE U. S. COMPANIES FIGHTING THAT FROM A JURISDICTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. I WOULD IMAGINE SO AT SOME POINT ALREADY KNOWS THAT GOOGLE NOW GOOGLE IS A UNIQUE EXAMPLE AND BECAUSE THEY THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE EUROPEAN STATUS WHEN THEY DO IN FACT HAVE EUROPEAN ESTABLISHMENT IT'S A LITTLE pBUT THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINE FIFTY MILLION EUROS WITH EVERYONE CALLED ABOUT THAT FINE ASSESSED AGAINST THEM. WE'VE SEEN OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE YOU REGULATORS HAVE KIND OF WAFFLE A LITTLE BIT ON THIS SO THERE IS A A A LETTER FROM THE UK INFORMATION COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO THE WASHINGTON POST TAKING ISSUE WITH SOMETHING THEY DID AND SAYING IT WAS IN VIOLATION OF GPR BUT THEN SAYING SOMETHING. LIKE WELL WE CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS. WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY PLANNED EXERCISE JURISDICTION WE JUST KNOW THEY CLAIM THEY CAN. OKAY AND THEN -- I JUST LAST QUESTION. FOR MS BRO -- OF THE COMPLIANCE ARE YOU YOU SAID THAT -- HOW COMPLAINT ARE YOU WITH G. P. ARE YOU HAVE YOU MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WITH CC? PA AS OPPOSED TO GDP ARE ARGUES IS SQUARE [inaudible] SOMEWHAT COMPLIANCE. SO YEAH HAPPIER DRESS THAT -- SO WE NOT ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE IN EUROPE BUT FOR THE ONES THAT ARE YES WEWE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO COMPLY WHICH ARE NOT JUST FOR SQUARE. BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE SERVE IN EUROPE TO ALSO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. OUT WE HAVE A PRODUCT IN PLACE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN TAKE IN THE DATA RIGHT ACROSS FROM THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS AND THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES -- AND WE HERE -- BUT TO ADDRESS ALSO MISTER GALLAGHER IS CONCERNED BECAUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE THIS VERY VERY CLEAR. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR FROM ME OR FROM SQUARE. THAT WE WANT YOU TO DILUTE THE DATA RIGHTS THAT IS NOT OUR POINT. IN FACT OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS PRETTY WELL ALIGNED WITH PRIVACY AND SECURITY. WHAT WE WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT? IS TO PROTECT THOSE LEADER RIGHTS JUST AS YOU DO GDP ARE PROTECTS THOSE STRONGLY. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT HAVING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LIKE THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE WHERE SOMEBODY CAN MISS USE DATA THE STOLE FROM ME TO PRETEND TO BE ME. AND PRETEND TO EXERCISE THOSE DATA RIGHTS BECAUSE THIS. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS MOST ANXIOUS ABOUT WITH JUDY PR IS TO MITIGATE THE RISK. THAT GDP ARE AT THE DATA RIGHTS WILL BECOME AN ATTACK VECTOR TO GET YOUR DATA WITHOUT HAVING TO HACK SOMEONE. ALRIGHT AND THEN -- MISTER THAGARD SAID THAT HE WANTED TO AVOID SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH SMALLER COMPANIES AND AND HE HAD THE THE LIMIT OF THE FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS AND YOU TOOK ISSUE WITH. WHAT IS THE REASON OUT OR DEVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S PER YEAR? SO IF YOU HAVE A WEBSITE YOU'RE AN ARTIST YOU HAVE A WEBSITE. YOU YOU TECHNICALLY CAN HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND I. P. ADDRESSES HIT YOU IN A YEAR PRETTY EASILY THAT'S EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PER DAY. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY MATH POINT MAY BE SLIGHTLY OFF BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT DOES ENCOMPASSING CAPTURE A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE PART OF THIS WHICH IS WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING A COMPLY WERE ALSO EMPOWERING OUR SELLERS WHO DO GET CAPTURED WITHIN CITY PA TO ALSO COMPLY WITH THE LAW? MISS RETIRED YOU HAVE A WELL I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF FRAUD AND THE SPECTER OF FEAR THAT IT RAISES SO. FOR OUR RIGHT OF ACCESS AND FOR A RITE OF POLLUTION THERE ONLY SUBJECT -- AFTER YOU HAVE A VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST THAT WE EXPLICITLY GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO SET SOMETHING IN STONE NOW THAT WOULD BE OUT OF DATE THREE OR FOUR YEARS. WE GIVE THIS TRAIN GENERAL THE RIGHT TO SET RULES ABOUT WHAT A VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST IS AND WE SPECIFICALLY SAY. THE YOU THE COMPANY DON'T HAVE TO DELETE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ACCESS IF YOU CAN'T DETERMINE THAT IT IS THE CUSTOMER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO ALL THIS TALK ABOUT FRAUD. IS. IS FRANKLY FEARS SAYING LIKE -- BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN WE CAN'T GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO THEIR INFORMATION. BUT OUR IN OUR PROPOSED RULES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TURN IT ON RIGHT NOW TO THE OWN DISCRETION CAM RELIEF -- ESTABLISH THAT IT IS THE CONSUMER TALK ABOUT WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN FRAUD BUT THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN WE SHOULD THEREFORE NOT DO IT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE SPEECHES. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS. WEEK WE'VE GIVEN RULE WRITING RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TRAIN GENERAL SO THE TRAIN GENERAL CAN CHANGE WITH THE TIMES BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING. CLEARLY WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A MASSIVE FACTOR FOR FRAUD. BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T ALSO GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THE INFORMATION SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE -- FOR APPROACH AND WE WORK SO YOU KNOW SELF CENTERED TO THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ANSWER WE WANT TO GIVE THAT TO THE TREE GENERAL AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND THEN WE WERE GONNA DRESS THE FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS. SO AS PART OF THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF TALK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW IF I'M LIKE BALK AT THE HUNDRED THREE SEVEN VISITORS A DAY WELL JUST YOUR I. P. ADDRESS ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ABLE -- TO THE COMPANY TO VERIFY WHO YOU ARE SO AGAIN IN OUR RULES TO OUR SUGGEST RULES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WE SAID LOOK. UNLESS YOU THE COMPANY CAN IDENTIFY WHO PEOPLE OR YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO AN ACCESS REQUEST SO FEW ALL YOU'RE DOING IS GETTING MUCH I. P. ADDRESSES. THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO HAVE A AN ACCESS REQUEST BECAUSE YOU CAN. FOR SURE IDENTIFY WHO SEVEN PEOPLE'S INFORMATION BUT THE EIGHT CREDIT CARDS OR EMAILS OR YOU KNOW YOU REALLY ARE TRYING TO TRACK THEM THEN. YEAH THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE NUMBER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE YEAR -- TO TO TO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND ALL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW. THE CHAIRMAN AND AND AND CENTERS FOR LAST YEAR. WEEK WE HAD A HIGHER NUMBER A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN OUR TO SHIP IT WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY THOUSAND THE LAW. I THINK WITH DUE CONSIDERATION FOR WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ONE AND SO AGAIN THIS IS WASN'T. THOUGHT LIKE IT'S ALL ME THAT THIS WAS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE WAS COMPLY WITH THE WITH THE RIGHT NUMBER. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH MISSED BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- AND THINKING MR TAGGART FOR FORGOT FORCING THE ISSUE BUT BUT IN A GOOD WAY BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS LONG OVERDUE TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT. THAT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN RESIDENTS -- ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT A AND AND YEAH THIS IS -- YOU THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK LAST YEAR WAS A GOOD FIRST STEP -- IN IN MAKING SURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE PROTECTIONS OVER THEIR DATA. A LIKE I SAID LAST YEAR -- YOU KNOW THE WALL WHILE THE PROCESS IS WITH A CHANCE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OF RAMIFICATIONS OF OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW -- AND WHILE I STRONGLY A 100% SUPPORT. PROVIDING MORE PROTECTIONS IN MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS OF MORE MORE CONTROL OVER THE DATA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE WALK THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS AND MAKE SURE. ARE THERE THINGS IN HERE THAT ARE OVERLY ONEROUS ON BUSINESSES AND NOT ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS -- AND SO ONE THING THAT I JUST WANT DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT WHICH MS BRING YOU -- MENTIONED IS THIS IDEA OF A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER -- AND YOU SAID WELL WE'RE GIVEN AG THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE REGULATIONS TO TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST PROCESS BUT IT DOES THE CURRENT LAW ALSO REQUIRES THAT EVERY BUSINESS HAVE AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER I MEAN THAT WAS SOMEBODY CALLING IN -- I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A BUSINESS COULD POSSIBLY CONFIRM THAT SOMEBODY IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE THROUGH THEM CALLING IN AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER GATE TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW EXPLAIN TO ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHY IT WHY THAT STEP WAS REQUIRED LONG? SO I THINK THE CONCERN HERE IS FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO A COMPUTER NECESSARILY OR POTENTIALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS -- TO A DEVICE AND ACTUALLY LOWER INCOME OR OR OR OR LESS EDUCATED AND SO THERE'S A IDEA THERE THAT WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM CONSUMERS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. AND I DO THINK IT'S WHERE THE AG -- AND THIS COMMITTEE FRANKLY AS YOU AS YOU GO THROUGH IT'S SORT OF THESE AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE -- AND AND AGAIN LIKE THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS I I I I WAS HAPPY TO PULL THE INITIATIVES BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS THE VENUE -- FOR MAKING CHANGES AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT SO COMPLICATED THAT IT WILL NEED CHANGES SO -- TYPE FOR* THAT THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH AND IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO I WANT TO THANK THE FIRST PANELISTS -- PANEL FOR BEING HERE AND LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL -- I LIKE TO NOW WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE HERE TO PROVIDE US WITH A STATUS UPDATE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REGULATORY PROCESS. AND ALSO DISCUSSED THE AG'S POLICY COMMENTS ON THE CCPA. R. JOINING US HERE TODAY IS MISS -- STACY SHORT SIR WHO IS THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL A WITH THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION PRIVACY UNIT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS STACY SHOPS ARE AND I AM THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. FOR THE CONSUMER LAW SECTIONS PRIVACY UNIT IN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE AIR BASE THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WHICH I WILL REFER TO AS THE CPA. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PLEASE IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMULGATING REGULATIONS. AND ENFORCING THIS NEW CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO STAY ENGAGED WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS IT CONSIDERS MODIFICATIONS TO THE LAW. I AM HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS TWO COMPONENTS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WORK ON THE C. CPI. FIRST I WILL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON OUR RULE MAKING ACTIVITIES. SECOND I WANT TO CONVEY SOME REMAINING POLICY CONCERNS REGARDING THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE CCPA. AS LONG AS OUTLINED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUGUST TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIR CHAO AND TO SENATOR HERTZBERG. THE AUTHORS OF AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AS PART OF MY I ALSO RENEW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REQUEST FOR RESOURCES AND FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR RULE MAKING DEADLINES AND SUSTAINED VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT. AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS AFFORDED BY THE CCPA. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA. TO THANK THE CHAIR AND SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR MAKING A COMMITMENT LAST YEAR. TO HELP DOJ WITH ITS TCPA FUNDING NEEDS WE THANK THEM. THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE SPEAKER THE PRO TEM AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING DOJ WITH THE TWENTY NINTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FUNDING. PURSUANT TO SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE OUR OFFICE MUST PROMULGATE CCPA REGULATIONS BY JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE ON TCPA. THAT ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR DURING THIS SESSION MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET THIS DEADLINE. SINCE JANUARY EIGHTH TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING PUBLIC FORUMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS PART OF OUR PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. WE HAVE HELD SIX FORMS TO DATE. IN SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO IN FRESNO. AND OUR LAST FORM WILL BE AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY ON MARCH FIFTH IN THE AFTERNOON. EACH FORM FOLLOWS THE SAME FORMAT. WE PROVIDE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF OUR OFFICES WORK AN OVERVIEW OF THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AS SET FORTH. IN THE CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT IN VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS CAN SUBMIT COMMENTS TO OUR OFFICE FOR CONSIDERATION DURING THIS PRE RULE MAKING STAGE. WE ALSO SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT A LIST OF SEVEN TOPICS AS THAT FOURTH IN CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT. ONE EIGHT FIVE AN ASSET THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THESE AREAS BECAUSE THEY REFLECT WHAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING WITH REGARD TO OUR JULY TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. THE SEVEN TOPICS ARE WHETHER THE REGULATIONS SHOULD ADDRESS ONE THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO THE DEFINITION OF UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS. THREE ANY EXCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. FOR HOW CONSUMERS CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST TO OPT OUT OF THE CELL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW THE BUSINESS SHOULD COMPLY WITH THAT OPT OUT REQUEST. FIVE WHAT TYPE OF UNIFORM OPT OUT LOGO OR BUTTON SHOULD BE DEVELOPED TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHT TO OPT OUT. SIX THE NOTICES IN INFORMATION THAT BUSINESSES MUST PROVIDE INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OFFERINGS. AND SEVEN HOW THE CONSUMER OR THEIR AGENT CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. TO A BUSINESS AND HOW THE BUSINESS REASONABLY VERIFIES THOSE REQUESTS. WE THEN OPEN UP THE FORM FOR ANYONE TO SPEAK. BECAUSE OUR ROLE AT THIS PRELIMINARY STAGE IS TO LISTEN AND SEEK BROAD PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WE DO NOT PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND WE DO NOT ASK OR ANSWER ANY SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS DURING THE FORUM. THE ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION HAS BURIED AT THE FORMS. FOR EXAMPLE OUR FIRST FORM IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ATTENDEES. BUT ONLY FOURTEEN SPEAKERS. THE MORE RECENT FORMS AND LOS ANGELES IN SACRAMENTO HAVE HAD MUCH HIGHER SPEAKER PARTICIPATION. FEATURING COMMENTS FROM THE AD TECH INDUSTRY PRIVACY ADVOCATES CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS. WE ENCOURAGE EVERY SPEAKER FORM ATTENDEE THE GENERAL PUBLIC INCLUDING YOUR CONSTITUENTS. TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO US. THE PUBLIC HAS AN IS CONTINUING TO SUBMIT THESE COMMENTS TO US BY EMAIL OR MAIL AND MAY DO SO UNTIL MARCH EIGHTH. TWENTY NINETEEN FOR CONSIDERATION DURING THIS PRELIMINARY PER. IN ADDITION WE HAVE CREATED NUMEROUS WAYS FOR THE PUBLIC TO STAY ENGAGED BY DEDICATING A PORTION OF OUR WEBSITE TO THE C.. MAINTAINING AN EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION LIST TO PUBLICIZE UPCOMING EVENTS AND POSTING ROLE MAKING MATERIALS AND ALL EVENT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE. WE HAVE ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR BILL MAKING PROCESS AND THAT THE PUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE. WE ANTICIPATE ENTERING THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PERIOD IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL BEGIN WHEN WE PUBLISH OUR NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION WHICH WILL INCLUDE AN INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS AND ATTRACT TAX OF THE REGULATIONS. THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARINGS RECEIPT AND CONSIDERATION A PUBLIC COMMENTS. RESPONSES TO THOSE COMMENTS AND ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE TEXT OF THE REGULATIONS. WE ONCE AGAIN ENCOURAGE YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO SUBMIT COMMENTS DURING THIS FORMAL RULE MAKING THE FINAL STAGE OF FILMMAKING. ALTHOUGH THE TIMELINE IS TIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO MEET THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THIS LEADS TO THE SECOND COMPONENT OF MY TESTIMONY. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SEATED IN HIS AUGUST TWENTY SECOND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LETTER. PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH PRIVACY PROTECTION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER. HOWEVER THIS CCPA AS IT CURRENTLY APPLIES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE PRESENTS UNWORKABLE OBLIGATIONS AND SERIOUS OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT THERE ARE FURTHERS STRESSED FAILURE TO CURE THESE IDENTIFIED FLAWS WILL UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH INSISTING VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE C. CPA'S CRITICAL PRIVACY WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS LAST YEAR. BY IT SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE HOWEVER THREE IMPORTANT ONE STILL REMAINS. FIRST. THE CCPA ALLOWS ANY BUSINESS AND THIRD PARTY TO SEEK GUIDANCE DIRECTLY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. ASKING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AT TAXPAYERS EXPENSE DIRECTLY CONFLICTS WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE AND ENFORCE THE LAW. AGAINST ENTITIES THAT VIOLATE THOSE LAWS. OUR OLIGATION IS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT THE BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE THESE LOTS. REQUIRING THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED LEGAL ADVICE TO PRIVATE PARTIES WOULD BE UNFAIR AND UNCONSCIONABLE NOT TO MENTION A WASTE OF VALUABLE STATE RESOURCES. SECOND THE CCPA PROVIDES A BUSINESS WITH THE RIGHT TO CURE ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION BEFORE BEING HELD A COT ACCOUNTABLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW. THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. BUSINESSES WOULD BE PERMITTED TO VIOLATE THE LAW EVEN KNOWINGLY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY TO INITIATE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION WITHOUT GIVING THE BUSINESS NOTICE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE VIOLATION. THIS WOULD NOT ONLY FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER HOW OUR OFFICE INVESTIGATES AND PROSECUTES CORPORATE MISCONDUCT. BUT IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY HINDER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. EVERYDAY WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES BEING CARELESS WITH CALIFORNIANS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DATA. THIS EASY P. AS RIGHT TO CURE WOULD ALLOW EVEN THE WORST OFFENDERS TO RECEIVE A PATH RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO USES PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION ENFORCING THE LAW. GIVING BUSINESSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FIX THAT TICKET DISADVANTAGES BOTH CONSUMERS AND HONEST BUSINESSES THAT ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES. THIRD. THIS CPA LACKS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIANS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RULES CONFERRED BY THIS GROUND BREAKING LAW. INSTEAD THE ACT INCLUDES ONLY A LIMITED RIGHT TO SUE YOU IF THE CONSUMER BECOMES A VICTIM OF A DATA BREACH. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PROVIDE A CRITICAL ADJUNCT TO GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT AND THE ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS AND SEEK APPROPRIATE REMEDIES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL URGES YOU TO EXPAND THE CZ PA PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO INCLUDE VIOLATIONS OF THE KEY RIGHTS PROVIDED BY THIS ACT. FINALLY WE WANT TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE CHAIR AND SENATOR HERTZBERG. THE SPEAKER THE PRO TEM AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING DOJ WITH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FUNDING. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR INCLUDING IN HIS TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL THE AMOUNT DOJ REQUESTED FOR THE ON GOING COSTS OF THE CCPA IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. WE WOULD ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT FOR THE AMOUNT AS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AT THIS POINT I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY TESTIMONY TODAY. WHILE I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS OUR RULE MAKING ACTIVITIES THUS FAR OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POLICY CONCERNS BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF DRAFTING THE REGULATIONS I CANNOT OPINE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE C. CPA. OR DIMENSIONAL ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE AS WELL AS FOR CONDUCTING THE FORMS OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE -- ON INCREASING THE THE RESOURCES AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT YOU GUYS NEED SO WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TINA LET ME JUST POSE THE QUESTION -- REGARDING THE THE FIRST ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED -- OF THE THREE ARE REGARDING -- BUSINESS GUIDANCE AND A POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ON ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE OF FOR LAST YEAR ON A. B. -- FOUR FIFTY YOUR OFFICE ACTUALLY ISSUE SOME KIND OF ADVISORY GUIDANCE Là LETTER OR OF COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS OR YOU KNOW TO GUIDE THE ON HOW TO COMPLY WITHOUT LAW A. B.. FOR FIFTY I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT HE BEFORE FIFTY IT'S ABOUT -- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS. ADVICE ON HOW TO COMPLY I THINK WE WERE JUST RENEW OUR POSITION THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT TYPE OF OF LEGAL ADVICE TO COMPANIES REGARDING -- HOW DO HOW DO COMPLY WITH THE LAW YEAH WE'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU -- GOING FORWARD BUT I THINK THE THE BILL IT ESSENTIALLY A BEFORE FIFTY WAS RELATED -- TO IMMIGRANT WORKERS. IMMIGRANT WORKER PROTECTION ACT -- WHICH WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. I'LL I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFF YES. I WILL LOOK INTO THAT AT THAT HE'S ACTUALLY WAS A A YOUR OFFICE ISSUE THE GUIDANCE LETTER OR VISOR GUIDED THIS LETTER. TO YOU KNOW TO THE COMMUNITY AS TO HOW YOU KNOW OUGHT TO WHAT OUGHT. TO HAPPEN TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW ON BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION AS WE GO OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISSOURI GO AHEAD. OF I MIGHT JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ABOUT -- THE PEORIA. I THINK THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OFF THE BALLOT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO P. R. A.. IT'S NOT JUST THE AG THAT CAN ENFORCE RIGHT IT'S ALSO -- CITY ATTORNEY'S. UNDER AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE UNDER THE CITY PA CURRENTLY YES I BELIEVE THAT ENFORCEMENT IS CENTRALIZED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ONLY. OKAY THAT I'VE. THAT WAS MY UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE BOOK DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP I'M SURE YOU WOULD KNOW BEFORE I WOULD I THOUGHT IT WAS -- CITY ATTORNEYS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND THE AG I BELIEVE THAT IT'S SOLELY LIMITED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN TERMS OF BRINGING ENFORCEMENT ACTION. OKAY AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL BUDGET REQUEST THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS JUST TO WRITE UP THE REGULATIONS NOT NECESSARILY THE ADDITIONAL -- MONEY THAT WOULD TAKE IF IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THE ENFORCEMENT. THE THE FUNDING REQUEST IS BECAUSE OF WE HAVE AN ON GOING AUTHORITY TO WRITE REGULATIONS THAT ARE DUE BY THE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AS WELL AS THE STATUTE GRANTS -- ON GOING WILL MAKING AUTHORITY AND FOR PURPOSES OF MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT -- RESOURCES ONCE A LOT GOES INTO EFFECT. OKAY AND THEN -- ON THE FIRST ITEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE BUSINESSES ADVICE THAT I GUESS IT'S KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRAP. IS THERE GOING TO BE AT LEAST SOME WRITTEN GUIDELINES ON HOW BUSINESSES -- SHOULD COMPLY. AT THIS FROM THE AG AT THIS POINT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IT PROVIDES ANY BUSINESS OR ANY BUSINESS OR THIRD PARTY TO SEEK GUIDANCE OR TO ASK FOR LEGAL ADVICE ESSENTIALLY ON HOW TO COMPLY. I THINK THAT PROVIDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH -- BUT THE ABILITY. TO PROVIDE GENERAL GUIDANCE COULD BE SOMETHING THAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE PART OF THE INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS -- BUT REQUIRING THAT WE RESPOND TO ANY BUSINESS EVEN GLOBALLY WOULD BE -- FAR TOO BROAD IN TERMS OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR ENFORCING THE LAW. THAT. EIGHT EIGHT I GUESS I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHERE. YOU YOU WOULD ISSUE SOME AT LEAST WRITTEN GUIDELINES ON HOW BUSINESSES SHOULD COMPLY OR YOU MIGHT DO THAT. I'M I'M I HAVE WE HAVEN'T SAT DOWN AND AND DETERMINED THAT JUST YET -- AND I'S SOMETHING WE CAN CONSIDER DOING BUT AT THIS POINT THE WAY THE STATUTES WRITTEN. IT IT IS FAR TOO BROAD. OKAY THANK YOU. A PICTURE MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- AND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE -- AS WE GO FORWARD YES THANK YOU THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. TO THAT BRINGS US TO OUR THIRD PANEL -- I LIKE TO WALK HIM I WAS THIRD PANEL SPEAKERS WHO WILL BE DISCUSSING THE C. CPA'S WORKABILITY AND CLARITY ISSUES. OF JOINING US HERE TODAY WE HOW FAR CEREBRAL IT FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. ARE EREKLE MAN WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF LAW FROM KEVIN MCKINLEY WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION TONYA FORESIGHT ALL WHO IS A PARTNER. IN PRIVACY DATE IN SECURITY GROUP CHAIR HOMA WE HEARD FROM. OUR MARGARET LAST WITH THE RETAILERS ASSOCIATION ELIZABETH ON AUG GALAXIA -- WILL VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION ALISTAIR MATAK GROUP WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WELCOME. ALL OF YOU TO OUR HEARING A LET US BEGIN WITH MISS -- BOOED WELCOMES MISSED IT. IT IS A SIGN OKAY -- I WOULD BEFORE SERRA UT -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BEFORE I GET STARTED MY PLAN TESTIMONY FOR THIS PANEL WOULD IT BE OKAY FOR ME THAT MAKE A FEW COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE AG'S TESTIMONY ABSOLUTELY. FREE SO MUCH -- I JUST WANT TO FIRST THANK STACEY SHASTA AND HER TEAM FOR CREATING MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC FORUMS AND FOR MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THEY PLAN TO REVIEW ALL OF THE DETAILED. WRITTEN COMMENTS SUBMITTED TO THEM DURING THIS INFORMAL PERIOD THE PROCESS FEELS VERY OPEN MINDED AND INCLUSIVE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE APPRECIATE UNDERSTAND A DAUNTING TASK THE AG'S OFFICE SPACES TO DRAFT REGULATIONS AND TO ENFORCE THE CZ P. AND THEIR CONCERN OVER LACK OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. AS A STATE WE HAVE DECIDED THE LEGISLATURE HAS DECIDED THAT PRIVACY IS WORTH INVESTING IN LEGISLATURE'S ASK CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PRIVACY. YOU ALREADY HEARD FROM TANYA FORESIGHT THE BUSINESSES ARE SPENDING A FORTUNE TO COMPLY WITH THE GT PR WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPECT THE SAME TO HAPPEN HERE WITH THE CPA. WE'VE ALREADY ASKED BUSINESSES TO INVEST AGREED IT NEEDS TO INVEST TO AND THAT MEANS GETTING ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO THE AG. BUT AS WE THINK THROUGH HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT INVESTMENT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE CZ PA. IS IT FOR LAWSUITS AN ATTORNEY'S FEES AS A FOREIGN FORSMAN ACTIONS OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE NOT -- THE GOAL SHOULD BE COMPLIANCE AND THAT MEANS THAT A STATE INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES FOR THE AG TO PROVIDE ADVISORY OPINIONS TO BUSINESSES ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THIS COMPLEX AND CONFUSING Là WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT. A STATE INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF NEEDED TO CURE THEIR APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES OF THE CCPA WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT. AND FRANKLY THESE KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES ARE GONNA BE FAR MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES AND COSTLY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AND AS FOR THE P. R. A. THE IDEA THAT WE'RE WE WOULD ADD A PR A TO THIS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING AND DETAILED COMPLEX PLOT IS IS FRIGHTENING. YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE ABUSES THAT HAVE STEM FROM HAGA FROM HAVING TRIAL LAWYERS AND FORCE THE TECHNICALITIES OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT AND NOW IMAGINE CREATING THE SAME SYSTEM HERE FOR THE VERY COMPLEX THE CPA. AGAIN THEIR PRIVACY EFFORTS WHO CAN'T AGREE ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS LAW AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TRIAL LAWYERS GO AFTER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO TEST THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO. IT WOULD BE A CLASS ACTION BONANZA AND AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW 50% OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FILED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. IMAGINE JUST HOW MUCH THAT NUMBER WOULD INCREASE IF ALL THE MANY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CPA ARE SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. ESPECIALLY IN THE YEARS THAT COME RIGHT AFTER THIS LAW TAKES EFFECT IN BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK FRANKLY OUR COURT SYSTEM CAN'T HANDLE THAT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES CAN'T HANDLE IT AND THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY CAN'T HANDLE THAT? WE NEED TO FACE THE FACTS THE CCPA IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING -- FOR COMPANIES TO COMPLY WITH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TO COMPLY ARE NOT THE HANDFUL OF TECH GIANTS IN THE STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING PROCESS WE NEED TO FIX A LOT WITH LEGISLATION IN WAYS THAT WERE ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ON THIS PANEL HERE TODAY WE NEED TO ENSURE THE EACH SHE HAS THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND TIME TO CRAFT THOUGHTFUL REGULATIONS. AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO SET BUSINESSES UP FOR SUCCESS BECAUSE THE PRIVACY GOALS AT THE CCPA THAT WE ALL CARE SO MUCH ABOUT WILL BE MET. WHEN COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW NOW -- AGAIN I SAID. SERIBU WITH CAL CHAMBER TELL CHAMBER REPRESENTS BUSINESSES ACROSS EVERY INDUSTRY INCLUDING OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES MANY OF WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CCPA. OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE HERE KNOWS THIS LAW WAS PASSED WITH JUST ONE WEEK IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS -- AND THAT WAS DUE TO THE IMPENDING DEADLINE TO REMOVE THE INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT. BUT THE RESULT IS THAT ASPECTS OF THIS LAW ARE CONFUSING AND THEY DO PRESENT SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED -- DESPITE THAT REALITY IT IT FEELS LIKE MOST OF THE ARTICLES THAT YOU READ ABOUT CCPA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE DESCRIBED YOU KNOW ANY BUSINESS CONCERNS WITH THIS LAW IS BIG TACK TRYING TO ROLL BACK RATES AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU IS THAT THAT. IS NOT THE CASE -- WE TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER -- IN THE LAST PANEL IT WAS IT WAS DISCUSSED THAT THE CCPA APPLIES TO A MASSIVE SCOPE BUSINESSES MORE THAN PEOPLE REALIZE MORE THAN JUST DATA BROKERS ARE COMPANIES THAT MAKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE OR MORE -- THERE'S A THIRD CATEGORY IN A BUSINESS IS THE ANNUALLY RECEIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION UP FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE CONSUMERS HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICES -- RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MR ATTACK OR THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT SUCH A COMPANY LIKE ADS AN AD SUPPORTED BLOG. WOULD NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LOT. THE WAY THAT THE LAW IS WRITTEN. ALL INFORMATION IS AN I. P. ADDRESS AND IF A COMPANY IF AT BLOCK GETS YOU KNOW FIFTY THOUSAND HITS IN A YEAR ABOUT WITH HER THIS NUMBER AS WELL ABOUT AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN HIT TODAY. THEY ARE GONNA BE COVERED BY THIS LAW WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT. ARE BASED ON THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT USUALLY CONDUCTS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN TRANSACTIONS IN A DAY. WHICH WOULD BE WAS PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE ABOUT TWELVE TRANSACTIONS PER HOUR OVER TWELVE HOUR PERIOD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVENIENCE STORES COFFEE SHOPS RESTAURANTS AND SO MANY MORE. THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE COVERED BY THIS. AND THAT FIFTY THOUSAND THREE HAS HAS FEWER THAN FIFTY THOUSAND UNIQUE VISITORS BECAUSE ONE CONSUMER UNDER THIS LAW COULD BE COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES FOR EXAMPLE. IF A CONSUMER PURCHASES AN ITEM. IN A STORE ACCESS THE WEBSITE FROM THEIR HOME COMPUTER AND FROM A MOBILE DEVICE. BUSINESS COULD ALSO MEET THE THRESHOLD WITH SOME COMBINATION OF THIS DATA FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN THE STORE TWENTY THOUSAND ONLINE HITS THE POINT IS IT COVERS A LOT MORE BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE REALIZE AND I TREAT THEM ALL THE SAME AS THE HANDFUL OF TECH GIANTS IN THE STATE. SO YOU LISTEN TO OUR TESTIMONY TODAY WHICH IS ASKING YOU KEEP ALL OF THIS RANGE OF BUSINESSES IN MIND THAT MEET THE THRESHOLD AND ASK YOURSELF HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAWS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED. AND JUST PLEASE KEEP AN OPEN MIND TO WORKING WITH US ON FIGURING OUT SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THIS THESE PROBLEMS ARE PRESENTING TODAY I'M GOING -- TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE DESCRIBE TWO OF OUR CONCERNS RELATED TO DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY -- AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT THE PREVIOUS PANEL -- THIS EASY PAY REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO SEND CONSUMER SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION THE BUSINESSES COLLECTED AFTER RECEIVING A CONSUMER REQUEST. BUT SPECIFIC PIECES OF pCOULD MEAN THAT BUSINESSES MUST TRANSMIT HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BACK TO CONSUMERS LIKE CREDIT CARDS OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. AS WELL AS LOCATION DATA OR SPECIFIC INTERNET SEARCHES INFORMATION CONSUMERS ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES. THE RISK OF FRAUD STIRS POSING AS A CONSUMER TO GET ACCESS TO THIS DATA INTO LEVY EIGHT THAT RISK BUSINESSES MAY NEED TO COLLECT EVEN MORE INFORMATION FROM A REQUESTING CONSUMER TO BE SURE. IT'S SENDING SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PERSON ESPECIALLY WHEN A BUSINESS HAS NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMER. IS RUNS COUNTER TO THE PRIVACY GOALS OF THIS RUMORS AND SO WHERE CRESTING A CC PM AT TO LIMIT THESE RISKS. SECOND THE C. C. P.'S REFERENCES TO HOUSEHOLDS AND DEVICES IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ALSO PRESENTS SOME SERIOUS RISKS. AS DRAFTED ONE MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHETHER THEY ON ABUSIVE SPOUSE OR ROOMMATE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THE SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AGAIN INCLUDING GEO LOCATION DATA HOURS EVEN SHOPPING RECORDS ABOUT ANOTHER MEMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD. FOR EXAMPLE HOUSEHOLD MEMBER MAY REQUEST ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM GROCERY STORE DELIVERY ITEMIZING ORDERS FOR THAT ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD BASED ON ADDRESS. AND THEN EXPOSE A HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS PURCHASE OF SAY BIRTH CONTROL OR PREGNANCY TEST. SIMILARLY ONE USER OF A DEVICE COULD REQUEST ALL THE SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION A COMPANY HAS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE THE MERE FACT THAT A BUSINESS HAS ANY DATA FOR A PARTICULAR DEVICE COULD REVEAL PRIVATE THINGS ABOUT ANOTHER USER. OF THAT DEVICE TO THE PERSON MAKING THE REQUEST. AND NOT ONLY DOES THE INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLDS AND DEVICES COMPROMISE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS IT COULD ALSO INFRINGE ON THE CHOICES OF OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE HOUSEHOLD MEMBER MAKES REQUEST TO DELETE ALL THE DATA SO SHE TO THE HOUSEHOLD. ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS OUR HOUSE OF INFORMATION. THIS RUNS COUNTER TO THE PRIVACY GOALS OF THE CPA AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE TO FIX IT -- GOING TO TURN OVER TO OUR NEXT PANELIST ERIC GOLDMAN AND AT THE AT ONCE THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SPOKEN I'VE ONE MORE ISSUE TO ADDRESS BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PANELIST PLEASE -- YES HI -- THIS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE HEARING. A MY NAME SIR COLEMAN I'M A PROFESSOR AT ST CLAIR UNIVERSE OF OUR SCHOOLS PRIVACY LAW CERTIFICATE I'VE BEEN AN INTERNET LAWYER FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- MY REMARKS TODAY FOCUS ON THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION -- THIS DEFINITIONS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE LAW BECAUSE IT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE REGULATED AND UNREGULATED INFORMATION -- AN OVERBROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION CREATES -- THE PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LAW WHICH I THINK IS THE CASE TODAY -- THE DEFINITION PERSONAL RATIONS DEFINED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION THAT IS REASONABLY CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR CONSUMER OR HOUSEHOLD. IS A BUNCH OF EXCEPTIONS -- TO THERE'S MUCH EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE -- THE DEFINITION DOESN'T LIMIT ITSELF -- TO TO SENSITIVE OR OBVIOUSLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SUCH AS NAME OR PHONE NUMBER OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. IT SITS UP EVERY SCRAP OF DATA -- THAT -- HAS THE THEORETICAL CAPABILITY OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMER -- UNFORTUNATELY THIS DEFINITION CRATES TODAY [inaudible] UP FIRST ANY INFORMATION -- THAT RELATES TO CONSUMERS COUNTS AS PERSONAL INFORMATION NO MATTER WHAT STEPS A BUSINESS MIGHT TAKE TO AVOID THAT OUTCOME. THE LAW INCLUDES SOME CONSUMER A DAY EXCLUDES SOME CONSUMER DATA FROM THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK THE REASON WHY IS THAT COMPUTER SCIENTIST INCREASINGLY CAN FIND WAYS TO ASSOCIATE INNOCUOUS BITS OF DATA WITH -- INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AS A RESULT AT VIRTUALLY EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION FROM ABOUT CONSUMERS TECHNICALLY MEETS THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF OF BEING RECENTLY CAPABLE OF BEING ATTRIBUTED. TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD SO DESPITE THE LAWS CLEAR INTENT OTHERWISE -- THE LAW TREATS ALL DATA IN A BUSINESSES POSSESSION AS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SUBJECTS THAT DATA TO THIS LOS STRICT REQUIREMENTS. OF MOST A LAWS OBLIGATIONS THAT INCLUDES PORTABILITY DISCLOSURES DELETIONS BECOME -- IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER IF ALL THE INFORMATION AND CAN IN IT BUT THIS IS POSSESSION IS TREATED AS PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THE LAW CREATES AN UNTENABLE SITUATION WHEN A CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION RESIDES IN MULTIPLE DATABASES AND THE CONSUMER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE STATUTORY RIGHTS. TO ACCESS OR DELETE THAT INFORMATION SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS MIGHT WORK -- ANOMALY RETAILER MIGHT ALLOW CONSUMER TO CREATE A PERSONAL PROFILE -- AND IT MIGHT ALSO A SEPARATE DATABASE WORD DELIVERS CUSTOM -- PERSONALIZED DEALS BASED ON THE IF THE CONSUMER ASK THE RETAILER TO TO LEAD ALL THE INFORMATION IN -- ALL ALL OF HIS OR HER PERSONAL INFORMATION -- THAT MIGHT BE EASY TO DO FOR THE CONSUMER PROFILE BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE BUSINESS GOING TO DO ABOUT THE I. P. ADDRESS IN THE SEPARATE -- OFFERS DATABASE THE LAW SIMPLY REQUIRES THE RETAILER TO DETERMINE THE CONSUMERS IP ADDRESS IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE MANY I. P. ADDRESSES ARE SHARED LIKE ON A WIFI NETWORK UPDATE RETAILER. DETERMINE THAT BELONG TO THE CONSUMER AND THEN DELETED. THIS REQUEST BECOMES EVEN MORE UNREALISTIC WITH OFFLINE DATA SAVED SECURITY -- CAMERA FOOTAGE OF THE CONSUMERS SHOPPING IN THE STORE WHERE SALES PERSONS NOTE OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE CUSTOMER -- LOTS SAYS IT LINKING ACROSS DATABASES IS REQUIRED BUT THIS ONLY APPLIES IF THE INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA BASES ISN'T ITSELF PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT SENSE VIRTUALLY ALL DAY THE IN -- BUSINESS VISION IS CHARACTERIZED AS PERSONAL INFORMATION DECISION ACTUALLY DOESN'T HELP INSTEAD THE LAW MECHANIC PRODUCTIVELY REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO DIGITIZE MORE DATA SO THEY CAN -- AND PROACTIVELY LINK THEIR DATABASES SO THEY CAN MAKE THOSE FUTURE ACCESS OR DELETION REQUEST EASIER -- THE THIRD -- CONCERN I HAVE IS THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION EXCLUDE SOME GOVERNMENT -- PUBLISHED DATA BUT EVEN THAT IS NOT REALLY USABLE UNDER LAW -- AND BROUGHT RISK -- MY LAST CONCERN OVER IS IS -- AS MISS -- BID OR DISCUSSED -- THE DEFINITION OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE MEANS THAT A PERSON CAN SEE AND IN FACT -- THE INFORMATION OTHER PEOPLE AND THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF PERSONAL -- THIS IS TO BE IS DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION REACHES BEYOND THE ANALOGOUS GPR DEFINITION -- THAT GPR DEFINES PERSONAL DATA AS ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO A IN IDENTIFIED OR DATA FIVE WILL NOT A PERSON. I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE TREATY PR I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DEFINITION BUT I THINK LIKE THE SABER MENTIONED EARLIER I BELIEVE THAT. ADOPTING THAT DEFINITION WOULD SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED TODAY -- I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE DRAFTING STRICTLY TODAY. THANKS VERY MUCH ON A NEXT A PANELS PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY HAITIAN WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FORTY FIVE LEADING INTERNET COMPANIES. INTERNET ASSOCIATION MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF CCPA TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ACCESS DELETE AND MOVE IT. IN GRANTING THESE RIGHTS CCPA REDEFINED SOME COMIC COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD CONCEPTS ONE EXAMPLES CONCEPT OF CELL. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE IN MR TAGGART WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS KNOW WHEN HOW AND TO WHOM THEIR INFORMATION IS SOLD. THIS IS SOMETHING INTERNET COMPANIES ALSO SUPPORT. HOWEVER IN REDEFINING CELL WE BELIEVE CCPA UNINTENTIONALLY JEOPARDIZES. THE PRIVACY PROTECTIVE PRACTICES USED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING. I'LL TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS WHY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE NEW DEFINITION AND HOW WE CAN FIX IT. ONLINE ADVERTISING WAS DESIGNED WITH PRIVACY IN MIND INSTEAD OF CARRYING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AROUND HE WEB. ONLINE ADVERTISING USES IDENTIFIERS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY TIED TO INDIVIDUALS. ADVERTISERS DO NOT NEED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOUR NAME ADDRESS OR OTHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO SHOW YOU AN AD ONLINE BUT THEY DO NEED BASIC DATA ACROSS THE WEB IN ORDER TO DO SO. CLICKING ON THE WEB PATIENTS INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE WEBPAGE TO POPULATE. A WEB PAGE MAY DRAW FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES ONE DATA BASE SHOWING THE LATEST NEWS. ANOTHER SHOWING A PHOTO ANOTHER SHOWING STOCK PRICE STILL ANOTHER SHOWING ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH HELP SUPPORT AND PAY FOR THE CONTENT OF YOUR VIEWS ON THE PAGE. MORE SPECIFICALLY CLICKING ON THE PAGE SINCE THE I. P. ADDRESS THE DATE AND TIME STAMP BROWSER TYPE MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM TYPE SOME ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION. ABOUT THE ACTUAL DEVICE BEING USED TO PROPERLY FORMAT THE CONTENT. AS WELL AS ANY COOKIE INFORMATION ALL THESE DIRECT WHICH CONTENT WILL POPULATE THE PAGE INCLUDING WHICH AT BEST FITS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE BITS OF NON IDENTIFIABLE TECHNICAL INFORMATION WHICH A BASIC MECHANICS OF THE INTERNET ONE TENDED TO BE COVERED BY CCP'S DEFINITION OF SELF. IN COMMON UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION IS NEITHER PERSONAL NOR IS BEING SOLD IN THIS PROCESS. TREATING THIS IS SELF PERSONALLY FOR MIGHT INFORMATION JEOPARDIZES THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THE INTERNET. IN ADDITION TO THE COMMONSENSE NATURE OF NOT CONSIDERING THESE DATA FLOWS A SALES I ONCE IN A MOMENT A MEAN IF THEY WERE CONSIDERED SALES. MANY INTERNET SERVICES WE RELY ON EVERY DAY ARE SUPPORTED BY AD REVENUE THIS MODEL ALSO EMPOWERS CREATORS AND ALLOWS THEM TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES THROUGH CONTENT. SMALL PUBLISHERS ALSO MAKE A LIVING BY WRITING BLOGS ON EVERYTHING FROM COOKING TO GARDENING TO COVERING COMMUNITY NEWS AND GENERALLY SUPPORT ABOUT ONLINE ADVERTISING. LARGE PUBLISHERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS ALSO RELY ON AD REVENUE TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS. FURTHER MANY SMALL BRICK AND MORTAR STORES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEIR NICHE AUDIENCES EFFICIENTLY THROUGH ONLINE ADVERTISING. TOGETHER THIS MODELS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE INTERNET SECTOR CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA TO PRESERVE. MIS CHARACTERIZING ADVERTISING IS A SALE OF DATA WOULD CONFUSE THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT REAL SALES OF THEIR ACTUAL PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS TIED TO THE NAME AND IDENTITY. IF THE DATA IF THE ADVERTISING DATA FLOW OR PUT THE SAME BASKETS ACTUAL SALES PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OP THAT A SALES WOULD IN REVENUE FOR THE SIR SERVICES PUBLISHERS AND LIMIT THE ABILITY. OF BUSINESSES TO FIND THEIR CUSTOMERS. WOULD ENDANGER BUSINESS MODEL FUNDAMENTAL TO THE INTERNET. AGAIN WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE INTENTION IT MISTER RETIRE CONFIRMED EARLIER THAT WASN'T ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THIS PRACTICE WE APPRECIATE THAT. HOWEVER WE FEEL THE STATUTES UNCLEAR AT THE MOMENT. IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE INTENT OF THE CPA AND TO PROTECT THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS MODEL WILL BE ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS PRACTICE THIS DATA FLOW THAT I DESCRIBED -- IS NOT CONSIDERED THIS A SALE UNDER THE ACT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN EXTERNAL IS PLEASE. MORNING AN GOOD MORNING AGAIN MR CHAIR MEMBERS. FROM MY TIME ON THIS PANEL AGAIN I'M TWENTY FOUR SITE WITH FREE FOR KERN A KLEIN AND CELLS -- ON THIS PANEL GOING TO DISCUSS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IN THE CBA. AND THE OVER REACH OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN ITS CURRENT FORM. FIRST LET'S START WITH THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMERS SO AS WE'VE HEARD ALREADY ADEPT THE CONSUMER IS A DEFINED TO BE ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. IN THE CURRENT LAW. DOES A QUOTE CONSUMER NEED NOT HAVE A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE SEA. WITHOUT CLARIFICATION THIS COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE EMPLOYEES. AND THAT OBVIOUSLY PRESENTS A NUMBER OF CONCERTS. KEEPING IN MIND THAT AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS USED TO BE A PRICE TO PIECES OF DATA DAY IP ADDRESSES OR CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING EMPLOYEES PASSING CURRENT. JOB APPLICANTS AND OTHER RELATED INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T HAVE A TRUE CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS WILL BE EXORBITANT. LET'S USE AN EXAMPLE A SMALL FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT THAT SERVES ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TABLES A DAY WILL HAVE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE CCPA AS IN ITS CURRENT FORM. FOR ITS KITCHEN WAIT STAFF. IN A BUSINESS WITH A VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE -- ALSO ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA A LOT. EMPLOYEES ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE PERSONAL RECORDS BUT THE CCPA WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW A SEPARATED SPOUSE IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD. TO GAIN ACCESS TO THEIR HOUSES THEY'RE SEPARATED THOUSANDS PAYROLL RECORDS IF THEY'RE IN THE HOUSEHOLD. THAT CANNOT BE WITH THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN THAT IT CURRENTLY ENCOMPASSES BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WE ARE OPT OUT OF BUSINESS DATA IN A BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTION. COULD RESULT IN FRAUD AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS. IMAGINE ALSO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE A SMALL MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT ALREADY COMPLIES WITH HIPAA FOR PATIENT DATA. BUT THAT WILL NOW BE REQUIRED TO HONOR OPT OUT AND DELETION REQUEST FROM SUPPLIERS WITH WHOM THE EMAIL. BUT EVEN WHERE THOSE SUPPLIERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT DATA THEY HAVE TO HONOR THE HONOR THE OPT OUT IN SOLUTION RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THERE EMAILING WITH THE SUPPLIERS THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS RIGHT NOW. IN WASHINGTON STATE SENATE BILL FIFTY THREE SEVENTY SIX EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES. EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS OF A BUSINESS WHEN THEY'RE ACTING IN THOSE ROLES FROM THE DEFINITION CONSUMER IN SECTION. THREE CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THE SAME. I WILL NOW TURN TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CCPA CURRENTLY ALLOWS CONSUMER TO SEEK STATUTORY DAMAGES OF ONE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER INCIDENT. WITHOUT ANY DEMONSTRATION OF HEART -- WHAT'S REQUIRED IS THAT THE CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO AN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND EXFILTRATION AFTER DISCLOSURE. AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS IS A VIOLATION OF THE DUTY TO IMPLEMENT MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES. WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REASONABLE SECURITY TODAY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT. THE CGPA WAS MEANT TO EXCLUDE ENCRYPTED DATA WE HEARD ABOUT THAT ALSO AS WELL AS REDACTED DATA. WE ALSO HEARD FROM MR RETIRED ABOUT THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT LANGUAGE DOESN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT ADDRESSED. WHAT WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT WE KNOW THAT EVERY BUSINESS HAS EITHER HAD THE DATA SECURITY BREACH EVERY BUSINESS? HAS EITHER HAD A DATA SECURITY BREACH OR WILL. EVEN IF THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES. IT IS THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY. THE PARLIAMENT INSTITUTE AND POLITICS JUST ISSUE THE RESULTS OF A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SIX HUNDRED OR MORE CYBERSECURITY LEADERS IN PROFESSIONAL SHOWING THAT 67%. OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN AVOID A DATA BREACH. ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE THREATS TO COMPANIES IS PHISHING ATTACKS WHICH ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED. SO THIS IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND EVEN IF AN ORGANIZATION HOUSING CRYPTID ALL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THAT IS NO SHIELD TO A FISHING ATTACK. BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REQUEST. SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE SMALL FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANTS. THE RESTAURANTS NIGHT MANAGER DISCOVERS THAT HIS EMAILS BEEN COMPROMISED OR PHISHING SCAM. THAT APPEARED TO COME FROM HIS OUTSOURCED IT GUY. AND ASKED HIM TO ENTER HIS CREDENTIALS. NOW HE SUSPECTS THAT THE BAD GUYS PROBABLY HAD ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION OF RESTAURANT CUSTOMERS THAT WERE IN HIS ACCOUNT. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS THE RESTAURANT HAS TO NOTIFY THOSE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND BY THE WAY IF THERE'S MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO NOTIFY THE AG'S OFFICE. UNDER THE CCPA EACH OF THOSE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS CAN NOW THROUGH THE RESTAURANT FOR ONE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER INCIDENT WHERE THEY CAN BRING CLASS ACTION. YOU CAN SEE HOW THE SITUATION QUICKLY SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL. IF THAT'S SMALL RESTAURANT SERVES EVEN JUST WANT RUMORS A WEEK OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND UNIQUE CREDIT CARDS A YEAR. THE DAMAGE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CLASS WOULD RANGE BETWEEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE LOW END AND THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS ON THE HIGH END. EVEN THE LOW END OF THAT RANGE PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BUY IT BANKRUPT ANY SMALL BUSINESS. IS WITHOUT POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS BUSINESS OWNERS WILL BE FORCED TO ENTER INTO IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT. BECAUSE THE COSTS OF LITIGATION ARE SO HIGH. EVEN IF THEY THINK THEY HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE BASED ON REASONABLE SECURITY THEY'RE GONNA BE FORCED TO SETTLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD WOULD GAIN. THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS WHEN BUTTHE CONSUMERS WILL BE ANY MORE PROTECTIVE THAN THEY ARE TODAY. AS NOTED ALREADY IS NOT IF BUT WHEN A COMPANY WILL HAVE A DATA SECURITY BREACH. AND THE ATTACKS ARE BECOMING MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME IN NATION STATES IN THE GAME. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE THE VICTIMS OF THESE ATTACKS BUT THEY ARE PUNISHED BY THIS LAW. THIS IS A SLEDGE HAMMER IT'S NOT A STICK AND A COMES A POINT WHEN DETERRENCE HAS DIMINISHING RETURNS. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE THIS LEGISLATION EVEN MORE PROTECTIVE OF THE CONSUMERS AS OPPOSED TO THEIR LAWYERS. AND LESS DAMAGING TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS A WHOLE BY CREATING A SAFE HARBOR TO THIS ONEROUS LIABILITY. BEYOND JUST THE ENCRYPTION REDACTION OR REASONABLE SECURITY AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE THINGS LIKE FISHING THE DO NOT THAT THOSE THINGS CANNOT ADDRESS. OR BY SIMPLY REMOVING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATUTORY DAMAGES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANKS VERY MUCH IN NEXT PANELIST PLEASE. MR JR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. MY NAME IS MARGARET LAST SEEN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. I CONCUR WITH TESTIMONY BY THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS HERE AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT C. R. A.'S DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE EXISTING LIABILITY IN CC PA AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD OPPOSE ANY EXPANSION OF THAT LIABILITY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN FIVE KNOWN AS THE NONDISCRIMINATION SECTION RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAMS WE APPRECIATE THAT MR MCTAGGART AND SOME CONSUMER GROUPS BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR THESE PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE. BUT WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE CLARITY OF THE LAW WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT CONSUMERS EMBRACE THESE PROGRAMS 80% OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE OPTED INTO AT LEAST ONE PROGRAM. AND MOST POPULAR SUPERMARKET AND DRUGSTORE PROGRAMS JURIES MEMBERS OFFER REWARDS PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMER LOYALTY. JUST AS YOU USE DATA ABOUT INDIVIDUAL VOTERS TO HELP OR TO VOTE WE USE DATA TO HELP BERNIE CUSTOMERS BUSINESS. THE LAW CURRENTLY SAYS A BUSINESS CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CONSUMER FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER CCPA. BY DENYING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CONSUMER CHARGING DIFFERENT PRICES ARE RATES INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF DISCOUNTS OR OTHER BENEFITS. AND PROVIDING A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR OR QUALITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES. THE SAME SECTION GOES ON TO SAY A BUSINESS MAY OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS AS COMPENSATION FOR THE SALE OR FOR THE COLLECTION OR SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. I QUOTE HERE A BUSINESS MAY ALSO OFFER A DIFFERENT PRICE RATE LEVEL OR QUALITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CONSUMER IF THAT PRICE OR DIFFERENCE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE VALUE PROVIDED TO THE CONSUMER. BY THE CONSUMERS DATA. CONFUSING I WOULD SAY SO. I APPRECIATE THE COUNTLESS HOURS THAT WENT INTO DRAFTING THIS LAW WITH THIS SECTION AND ITS INTERPLAY WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE LAW. LEASE RETAILERS GROCERS HOTELS HOTELS AND AIRLINES WONDERING WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH OUR LITTLE TOO YOU REWARDS PROGRAMS. WHY UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM? AND SEE AREAS MEMBERS WANT TO DO SO WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW. ULTIMATELY IN THIS UNLESS THIS SECTION IS CLARIFIED EITHER THIS COMMITTEE NOR ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY WILL DETERMINE THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS. INSTEAD IT WILL BE UP TO THE COURTS TO RECKON THAT COULD BEAR ON THESE PROGRAMS THAT'S THE UNCERTAINTY WE WANT TO END BEFORE IT ENDS LOYALTY PROGRAMS. PERHAPS YOU'RE THINKING OUR LOYALTY PROGRAMS SELLING MY DATA. SHEARER SEE ARI'S MEMBERS ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING DATA. WE WANT TO SO GOODS AND SERVICES BUT SOME OF THE MOST POPUAR PARTS OF OUR PROGRAM. COULD BE POTENTIALLY CONSIDERED A SALE UNDER THE SWEEPING DEFINITION IN CCPA FOR EXAMPLE SAFE LIKE THE REWARDS CLUB MEMBERS CAN EARN DISCOUNTS AT CHEVRON AND JC PENNEY MEMBERS CAN USE THEIR REWARDS POINTS. FOR PER US PURCHASES AT SEPHORA IS IN JC PENNEY'S. WE SIMPLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THESE BENEFITS TO OUR CONSUMERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO PROTECT THESE PROGRAMS WHILE PROTECTING THE FRAMEWORK OF CCPA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NICE PANELS PLEASE. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SERRA BOOT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER JUST HAVE ONE LAST ISSUE TO COVER TO CONCLUDE OUR TESTIMONY -- ON THIS PANEL -- I KNOW AS PUBLIC SERVANTS ALL OF YOU ARE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY INTERESTED ENSURING THAT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. UNFORTUNATELY THE CCPA PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF DATA TO GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES THAT WILL HAVE A PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MANY CRUCIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PRODUCE PURCHASE DATA FROM BUSINESSES FOR A WHOLE HOST OF NECESSARY REASONS HERE'S JUST A FEW EXAMPLES -- THE SCREENING OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE HISTORY THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM. OUR PROVIDING PATIENT CARE SEARCHING TO REUNITE FOSTER YOUTH RELATIVES AS WELL AS TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF WOULD BE FOSTER PARENTS. CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES FRAUD PREVENTION AND PUBLIC RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL BENEFITS PROGRAMS. LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES FOR CRIMES AND THE CHILDREN IF BAD ACTORS CAN OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR DATA TO GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES FOR THESE LIMITED KINDS OF PURPOSES VALUABLE PURPOSES. ALL THE EFFORTS I JUST DESCRIBED COULD BE THWARTED. THE CZ PA'S OPT OUT PROVISION ALSO UNDERMINES LEGAL COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES AND EFFORTS TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE IMPORTANT WORK TO FIGHT MONEY LAUNDERING UNDER THE CURRENT LAW IS DRAFTED -- A COMPANY THAT'S PROVIDING ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING DATA SERVICES TO A BANK. IS NOT DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO ENTITLED WONDERING MONEY LAUNDERING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SO CANNOT CLAIM A LEGAL COMPLIANCE EXEMPTION. IT'S ALSO NOT A SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THE LAW WHICH MEANS A FIRM HANDLING DATA AT THE DIRECTION OF A BUSINESS SUCH AS A BANK INSTEAD. THE ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING COMPANIES A BUSINESS ITSELF PUTTING TOGETHER SERVICE WHICH IT THEN PROVIDES TO THE BANK. A SERVICE FOR WHICH UNDER THE CPA. ALLOWS BAD ACTORS TO OPT OUT AND EVEN IF THEY DETECTION. THIS EASY PAY ALREADY RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THIS PROBLEM IN THE DELETION SECTION OF THE LAW WHICH HAS AN EXEMPTION STATING THAT A BUSINESS NEED NOT DELETE DATA THAT'S NECESSARY TO DETECT SECURITY INCIDENTS OR TO PROTECT AGAINST MALICIOUS. DECEPTIVE FRAUDULENT OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THAT SAME TYPE OF EXEMPTION SHOULD BE APPLIED TO THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF DATA FOR THESE LIMITED PURPOSES -- WITH THAT AGAIN JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REFER YOUR ATTENTION FOR LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS A FOR HOLDING THIS FORUM SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS THEM -- WITH THE CCPA CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO ESTABLISH SUCH A ROBUST SET OF PRIVACY RIGHTS. AND IF WE CAN FIX THAT WE REALLY COULD BE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT WE DO HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO DO SO IS OF ALL THIS LANGUAGE -- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS OUR PANELISTS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER -- FOR NUMBER POINTS HERE -- JUST TAKE THEM IN IN IN SOMEONE IN ORDER YOU KNOW -- I THINK THE PRESS GOLDMAN ACTUALLY. FOR ME ARGUMENT THAT DID THIS INCREASING ABILITY OF COMPANIES TO ASSOCIATE TINY LITTLE BITS OF INFORMATION WITH US. INFORMATION WE DON'T YOU THINK IS OF AS PERSONAL. IS EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET AND SO -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE THE THE IDEA THAT THESE ARE NOT PERSONAL BITS OF INFORMATION I I FIND ACTUALLY. IS MISLEADING BECAUSE INCREASING THINGS WE DON'T THINK OF IT IN FOR HIS PERSONAL FURNISH ARE BECOMING PERSONAL INFORMATION. BROUGH VIDEO CAMERAS WE HAVE -- ONE TIME EXEMPTIONS IN BOTH OR ONE TEN ONE AT ONE HUNDRED SIX ONE HUNDRED ONE AND ONE TEN WE'RE THIS IS DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION -- IF IT'S NOT CONSIDERED PERSONAL INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW OUR OUR THOUGHT THERE WAS WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO CRAWL THROUGH ALL YOUR DID VIDEO SECURITY FOOTAGE -- WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT THE THE IMPLICATION LATER ON THAT THE THE BROWSER TYPE AND THE COOKIES ARE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS IS EXACTLY HELP. YOU'RE BEING TRACKED AT ALL TIMES NOW -- BECAUSE YOUR BROWSER TYPE AND THE COOKIES ON YOUR PHONE THE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS APP OR DIFFERENT EVERYTHING ONE OF US IN THIS ROOM HAS A DIFFERENT PHONE AND IT'S CALLED BROTHER FITTING FINGERPRINTING. SO YOU'RE BEING TRACKED ACROSS THE INTERNET ON ALL -- THIS IDEA THAT -- BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WITH A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS YOU CAN'T OPT OUT OF THIS BECAUSE THE LAST POINT THERE ABOUT SECURITY. YOU CAN'T OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR INFORMATION FOR DETECTING SECURITY INSTANCE THE PROTECTING ITS MALICIOUS DECEPTIVE FRAUDULENT OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW DEBUGGING THERE'S OF THE WHOLE LIST OF THINGS -- AND IT SOUNDS GOOD TO SAY THAT THEY'RE ALL THESE FLAWS THE LAW BUT THE REALITY IS WE DID SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS AND TO TRY TO ANTICIPATE THEM. WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA BREACH BUT AT THE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BE AFFECTED AGAIN. YOU COULD YOU DATA -- YOU KNOW THIS IS LIKE SAYING GET AN ANTI VIRUS -- WE ALL KNOW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN ANTI VIRUS -- A SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW A PROGRAM IS CALLED OUR COMPUTER -- AND WE DO HAVE THESE UP WE THINK VERY REASONABLE THRESHOLDS FOR COMPANIES WHERE -- AT THE DATA WHICH IS -- ONLY IMPACT YOU IF YOU REALLY HAVEN'T TAKEN REASONABLE CARE OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU'RE BEING ENTRUSTED WITH -- YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW TRACK YOU. THE IMPLICATION IF YOU TO CARRY THAT TO THE TO THE EXTREMEIS THAT WOULD BE A SAFER SOCIETY OF ALL OF US WERE SURVEIL AT ALL TIMES AND ALL OF OUR INFORMATION WERE ABLE TO BE TRACKED BY THE POLICE WELL LET'S. JUST NOT THE WAY OUR OR WORLD WORKS. AND AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT THAT THE THE BILL YOU CAN'T OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO TRANSFER YOUR INFORMATION FOR THESE. VERY MANY THAT YOU NEED IT PURPOSES WE THINK WERE. ELIZABETH DO YOU HAVE ANY. ENDING. FOR SURE HI ELIZABETH GILLIES ADVICE PRESIDENT COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. UP. I JUST BY WAY OF STEPPING BACK FOR A MOMENT I I THINK TODAY WERE HERE FOCUSING ON WORK ABILITY FOR INDUSTRY AND I WANT TO REMIND -- ALL INVOLVED THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WORD CONSUMERS -- WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES OUR PARENTS OUR FRIENDS OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FAMILIES OUR GRANDPARENTS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED THIS OUGHT TO BE WORKABLE FOR THEM SO THERE'S WORKABLE FOR INDUSTRY AND WORKABLE FOR CONSUMERS -- WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE IN PARTICULAR THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK IN ESTABLISHING AND CONSIDERING CHANGES TO THE CPA. COMMONSENSE SIDE A LOT LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE T. INITIATIVE LAST YEAR PRECISELY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR CONSUMERS AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. RIGHTS THAT WOULD COVER NOT JUST SELLING AND SHARING BUT ALSO USING COLLECTION AND IN A FRAMEWORK THAT DEFAULTS TO CONSENT -- TO GET INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC. FEEDBACK FROM THIS PANEL A YOU KNOW IN IN TERMS OF THIS YOU KNOW OUR GOALS IN TERMS OF PROTECT STRONG PRIVACY RIGHTS APPOINT TO THE CHAMBERS OWN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES INTRODUCED LAST FALL THAT STATE BUSINESSES SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT. ABOUT THE COLLECTION USE AND SHARING. WE LIKE TO SEE TRANSPARENCY AROUND COLLECTION AND USE AS WELL -- ALEXA FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT BE COLLECTING AUDIO OF MY FAMILIES AND ACTUALLY MY KIDS CONVERSATIONS AND STARING THAT STORING THAT DATA. FOR TO USE FOR FUTURE PROFILING AND TARGETING -- SO IN TERMS OF ONLINE ADVERTISING WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP -- TARGETED ADVERTISING ON SITES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE UNDER THE LAW IF AS KEVIN STATED THAT IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO AN INDIVIDUAL. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MANIPULATIVE ADVERTISING PRACTICES INCLUDING IN ELECTIONS -- THAT ARE MEANT TO MANIPULATE CONSUMERS AND OUR DEMOCRACY. SO IT PROVIDING IT EVEN MORE EXPLICIT CARVE OUT FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING. WILL ALLOW THESE PRACTICES TO CONTINUE AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AMENDMENT -- THAT SERRA ALLUDED TO IT. EARLIER THAT DOES EXIST UNDER EXISTING SHINE THE LIGHT LAW AND IN TWELVE YEARS OF THAT LOBBYING ACLU AND CALPERS AND OTHERS SAY SHOWN THAT. BUSINESSES HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLYING -- TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POINTS EARLIER COMMONSENSE. FOR US SUPPORTS THE REQUEST FOR MORE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS BEYOND THOSE PROVIDED IN THE CASE OF A DATA BREACH. WE CAN HAVE A STRONG LAW BUT IF IT'S NOT IN FORCE CONSUMERS LOSE OUT. WE HAVE COMMON SENSE FOR PROPONENTS OF THE NATION'S FIRST CONSUMER PRIVACY LAW CALIFORNIA SO PIPPA AND WERE NOT AWARE OF A SINGLE ACTION BEING FILED SINCE IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY. TWENTY SIXTEEN WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CAPACITY TO TAKE ON A HUGE BURDEN OF ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY ARE TASKED WITH IT IN THIS FRAMEWORK. AND WELCOME ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING BY LOCAL ENTITIES SUCH AS TO GAYS AND CITY ATTORNEY'S. G. P. R. WHICH COMPANIES NOW SEEM TO BE POINTING TO AS A FREE MARKETS WORKABLE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED IN THE YEAR LEADING UP TO IMPLEMENTATION -- I WILL POINT OUT CARRIES WITH IT DATA MANIPULATION AS WELL AS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH THERE IS A CAUSE OF ACTION THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE. THAT ADVOCATES CAN TAKE ON BEHALF OF AN INDIVIDUAL -- AS WELL AS HAS A NOTICING CONSENT OFTEN FRAMEWORK AND WE'VE SEEN FINES AND PENALTIES LEVIED SHOWING ITS IMPACT AND NOTE THAT SIMILAR RULES TO GPR EXISTED PRIOR. AND GPR ACTUALLY ADDED PENALTIES WHICH FORCED THE INDUSTRY TO COMPLY. WHY SHOULD AMERICANS CALIFORNIANS IN THIS CASE HAVE FEWER RIGHTS THAN EUROPEANS IF INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE COMPLIANCE TO HARMONIZE A BRIEF AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY WITH G. P. R.

TEN OFFICES IN THE STATE WE REALLY TRY TO USE OUR STRENGTH TO ENSURE THAT THE VOICES OF THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTED ARE HEARD IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND THE POLITICAL PROCESS. I'D LET THE IF YOU'LL USE WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON CONSUMER PRIVACY GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE FREE SPEECH AND NEW TECHNOLOGY SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FOUR I'VE WORKED IN THE IN THE COURTS IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH COMPANIES AND WITH COMMUNITIES BOTH HERE AND NATIONALLY. YOU'VE TITLED THIS PANEL MAINTAINING A LEAD IN PRIVACY AND TO THE ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD GO WE REALLY NEED TO START WITH THE FOUNDATION. WHAT CALIFORNIA GUARANTEES TO ALL OF US TO ALL OF YOU TO ME TO OUR FAMILIES AND TO FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS? ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THE VERY FIRST PROVISION IN THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS IS CLEAR. WE HAVE BEEN IN THE ONLY NOBLE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS CALIFORNIANS ARE RIGHT THE COULD NOT BE BOUGHT. OR SOLD TO BOTH PURSUE AND OBTAIN PRIVACY. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY WAS PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE VOTERS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES TO SUPPOSED TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS EXACTLY THE MODERN THREAT TO PERSONAL PRIVACY THAT WE SPEAK ABOUT TODAY. AS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HIGHLIGHTS IN ITS SEMINAL CASE A WHITE BE DAVIS THE MOVING FORCE BEHIND THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS WAS A FOCUSED PRIVACY CONCERNS. THING CROUCH MEN ON PERSONAL FREEDOM AND SECURITY CAUSED BY INCREASED SURVEILLANCE AND DATA COLLECTION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY. OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS BROADER THAN THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. TAX ALL OF US AGAINST INTRUSIONS BY BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS. AND A RIGHT TO PRIVACY PROTECTS ALL OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS MADE CLEAR CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A MYOPIC VIEW OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT INSTEAD TAKES A VERY TAX NEUTRAL APPROACH. IF THE INFORMATION CAN OFFER A VIRTUAL CURRENT BIOGRAPHY IT IS COVERED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AND FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON THE CALIPH AS FOR DECADES DEFINE PERSONAL INFORMATION AS ANY INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES. RELATES TO DESCRIBES OR IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH YOU OR WITH ME. AND AS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS ALSO MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR ARE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS FUNDAMENTAL AND COMPELLING. AS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE SAYS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY WAS ADDED TO THE CONSTITUTION TO PROTECT OUR HOMES. OUR FAMILIES OUR THOUGHTS OUR EMOTIONS ARE EXPRESSIONS OUR PERSONALITIES. OUR FREEDOM OF COMMUNION AND OUR FREEDOM TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PEOPLE WE CHOOSE. OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS THE OVER BROAD COLLECTION AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THE IMPROPER USE OF THIS INFORMATION THE USE OF IT FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE OR THE DISCLOSURE OF IT TO SOME OTHER THIRD PARTY. CALIFORNIA WAS WISE TO PUT IN PLACE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO PROTECT US IN THE MODERN DIGITAL WORLD. AND THE LEGISLATOR HAS ACTED IN VERY IMPORTANT BIPARTISAN WAYS OVER THE YEARS TO BE A LEADER AND PASSED PRIVACY LAWS TO FURTHER OPERATIONALIZE THESE RATES. THESE ARE LAWS THAT MANY IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOUGHT AGAINST WITH THE SAME TYPE OF CLAIMS WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. THESE ARE LAWS ON PRIVACY POLICIES AND DATA BREACH NOTIFICATIONS THE PRECURSOR TO SEE CPA THE TWO THOUSAND THREE SHINE THE LIGHT LAW. AND DOZENS OF CRITICAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT AND PROTECT WOMEN CHILDREN AND SENIORS. THESE LAWS HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN EMINENTLY WORKABLE BUT ALSO EMULATED IN OTHER STATES WHAT NEWS STORY AFTER NEWS STORY HAS MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR IS THAT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M WORKABLE RIGHT NOW IS THE SHARP DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE GUARANTEED. I WHAT CALIFORNIA STATUTORY LAW IS CURRENTLY MAKING A REAL FOR PEOPLE. AND THE ONLY THING BEING STIFLED RIGHT THE ACTUAL SECURITY OF CALIFORNIANS. WE ALL NOW KNOW ABOUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AND HOW THE PRIVATE AND INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION OF EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WITH SHARED. THE TRUE RAMIFICATIONS ON THE POLITICAL PROCESS UNKNOWN. BUT THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THERE BEEN MASSIVE BREACHES MARRIOTT EQUIFAX YAHOO TARGET WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL FOLLOW AT THESE AND SO MANY OTHERS WILL BE. BUT WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIANS WOULDN'T BE SITTING DUCKS IF WE HAD THE RIGHT MECHANISMS TO CONTROL OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER STORIES THAT ARE RECEIVED MUCH LESS PRESS BUT WITH NO LESS GRAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY FOR AN INCREASING NUMBER IN OUR COMMUNITIES YOUNG AND OLD WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL STRESS THE PROLIFERATION OF WEB WHINING PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING USED TO DETERMINE IF WE ARE OFFERED SERVICES. HOME LOANS CREDIT CARDS INSURANCE CAN BE PARTICULARLY DESTABILIZING. IN HOUSING A RECENT STUDY FROM BERKELEY HOT SHOWS HAVE DATED DRIVEN MORTGAGE LENDING IS PERPETUATING ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO BORROWERS ARE PAYING AN AVERAGE FIVE POINT SIX BASIS POINTS HIGHER TRANSLATING INTO COSTS OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR MINORITY BORROWERS. IN JOBS A CARNEGIE MELLON STUDY REVEALED THE DATED TRIMMING GOOGLE ADS FOR HIGH PAYING JOBS ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY SHOWN TO MEN. RATHER THAN TO WOMEN. AND JUST THIS YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT FACEBOOK DATA COLLECTION IS BEING USED TO ALLOW ADVERTISERS TO EXCLUDE LATINO BLACK AND OTHER ETHNIC AFFINITY USERS FROM SEEING INFORMATION ABOUT HOUSING. EMPLOYMENT AND JOBS. MORE THAN YOU FACEBOOK TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM WE'RE SHARING DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS DATA WAS BEING USED TO MONITOR AND TARGET UNIONS AND PROTESTERS WHO ARE CHARACTERIZED AS OVERT THREATS. AND YOUNG PEOPLE THE STORY BROKE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT THIS BOOK WAS GETTING USERS AS YOUNG AS THIRTEEN TO INSTALL AN APP TO TRACK THEIR HABITS. AND THE GIVE THE COMPANY ACCESS TO EVERYTHING THEIR PHONE SENT OR RECEIVED OVER THE INTERNET. NOT TO MENTION THAT IN RECENT YEARS THE PRIVACY COMMUNITY HAS DISCOVERED THAT MARKETERS HAVE BEEN COMPILING AND SELLING LIST OF RAPE VICTIMS. THOSE SUFFERING FROM HIV AND AIDS AND SENIORS WITH DEMENTIA. WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT WE ARE A CRITICAL JUNCTURE FOR PERSONAL PRIVACY IN CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY WE ARE FIGHTING ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN CONTROL OUR OWN LIVES. AND WE'RE FIGHTING ABOUT WHETHER THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE IN A POSITION TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ITS PEOPLE. OR WILL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS GROUPS LIKE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INTERNET ASSOCIATION BE ABLE TO STRIP THAT AWAY. I WANTED TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER FOR HIS WORDS THIS MORNING AND FOR HIS POWERFUL LETTER WITH OTHERS THIS WEEK TO CONGRESS ON PREEMPTION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CONGRESS KNOWS THAT ARE LAWMAKERS WILL NOT ALLOW A FEDERAL LAW TO BE PASSED THE PREAMPS AND UNDERMINES THE RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF ITS PEOPLE. AND WE MUST WORK RESOLUTELY HERE INSIDE CALIFORNIA MORE CAN AND MUST BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIANS REMAIN MORE THAN WORDS ON PAPER. THAT THESE PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE REAL TO ALL PEOPLE. FIRST THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL PRIVACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS LIMITATIONS OF CCPA THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SOMETHING LIKE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE TRULY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THE COMPANY STOP MAKING HOLLOW APOLOGIES AND ACTUALLY RESPECT OUR RIGHTS. NUMBER ONE REAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION THAT CAN IDENTIFY US AND OUR FAMILIES. THEY CAN SWING ELECTIONS INFILTRATES AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SHARE IN THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND GET DECENT JOBS PETER CHILDREN AND PUT A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. WE NEED THE RIGHT MECHANISMS TO KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING TO OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHAT'S BEING COLLECTED AND SHARED AND WITH WHO. RIGHT NOW THE CCPA ONLY TELLS CALIFORNIANS THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES. ARE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH KNOWING PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS SHARED WITH A RESEARCHER IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT THE KNOWING OUR PRIVATE READING. POLITICS A RELIGIOUS VIEWS WERE SHARED WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. KNOWING PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS SHARED WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT THAN KNOWING WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS SHARED WITH THE BANK THEY DENIED OUR MORTGAGE. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN SHARED AND WHO IT HAS BEEN SHARED WITH YOU ALSO HAVE NO WAY TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL. AND CORRECT MISTAKES OR STOP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM BEING MISUSED DOWN THE LINE. NUMBER TWO REAL POWER TO CONTROL HOW OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED AND FOR COMPANIES TO GET OUR PERMISSION FROM THE START. IS CHAIRMAN CHAO'S SAID THIS MORNING THIS IS COR. RIGHT NOW THE CCPA ONLY PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR CALIFORNIANS TO STOP THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PUTS THE BURDEN ON EACH OF US TO OPT OUT. TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE MUST HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL ALL THE WAYS OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED AND NOT JUST SOLD. CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THAT THESE PROCLAIMS THAT IT DOES NOT SELL ANY INFORMATION WHAT SO EVER. INSTEAD FACEBOOK CLAIMS IT JUST SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THE SCOPE OF THE SHARING IS TRULY DIZZYING IT IS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS. APPS WEBSITES INTEGRATIONS DEVELOPERS PARTNERS AND MORE AND IT'S NOT JUST FACEBOOK MOST OF THE MAJOR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES REPRESENTED BY THE BUSINESS GROUPS THIS MORNING. TO MAKE SOME OR ALL OF THEIR MONEY MY INFORMATION CLAIM THEY DON'T SELL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION EITHER. COVERING JUST SAIL IS OBSOLETE OUT OF THE GATE. AND UNDERSTAND WHY WE MAKE MUST MAKE COMPANIES ASK OUR PERMISSION FROM THE START AND NOT MAKE IT OUR BURDEN TO OPT OUT. JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT TRYING TO OPT OUT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHO HAS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. DO YOU KNOW ALL THE COMPANIES WHO HAVE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. HOW WILL YOU OPT OUT? AND EVEN IF WE KNOW SOME OF THE COMPANIES THEY HAVE VERY STRONG FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR US TO OPT OUT. MR MAKE THAGARD SAID THAT IT SWITCHED FROM OFTEN OPT OUT FOR LEGAL REASONS BUT WE ARE THE ACLU WORK ON MORE CONSTITUTIONAL CASES ON BOTH PRIVACY AND FREE SPEECH THAN ANYONE ELSE. GOODNESS KNOWS WE HARDLY EVER STOP TALKING ABOUT FREE SPEECH. BUT THIS ARGUMENT DOES NOT HOLD WATER CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THEY'RE STILL AN OPT IN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH IS GOOD. BUT THERE CAN AND SHOULD BE AN OPT IN FOR ALL PEOPLE. FINALLY REAL RIGHTS THAT ARE EQUAL FOR ALL AN ARE PROPERLY FOLLOWED BY COMPANIES THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS A CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHT IS AN INALIENABLE RIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. CCPA HAS A LOOPHOLE THAT MUST BE CLOSE TO MAKE SURE THERE CAN BE% NO DISCRIMINATION AND PEOPLE CANNOT BE PUNISHED WITH HIGHER PRICES OR DEGRADED SERVICE. FOR EXERCISING THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS CHAIRMAN CHAO YOU SAID IT THIS MORNING AND ALSO ELOQUENTLY LAST YEAR IN A SENATE HEARING ON BROADBAND PRIVACY. PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL DATA AND THAT PRIVACY SHOULD NOT BE A LUXURY RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. FINALLY PER ALL RIGHTS WE HAVE AND THEREFORE MUST BE PERSONALLY ENFORCEABLE. AS THE AG HAS MADE CLEAR THERE NEEDS TO BE A FULL PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. EVERY CALIFORNIAN MUST BE ABLE TO SEEK REDRESS IN COURT AGAINST COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE THE LAW JUST AS THEY CAN WITH ANY OTHER PERSON ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY FOR LETTING ME TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PRIVACY ON THE REAL PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE IS STILL YOU LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND MANY OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA LAW IS FURTHER UPDATED AND THE PRIVACY SAFETY AND FINANCIAL SECURITY ALL CALIFORNIANS. IS PROTECTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT PANELIST PLEASE MR. FORMER PROVIDING THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION -- TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS LEE TM AND I MANAGE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS ADF OFF -- BOTH IN DC IN SACRAMENTO AND STATE LEGISLATURES CROSS COUNTRY. IF UP IS NEVER BEEN SO BUSY IN OTHER STATES BEFORE AND THE REASONS REALLY SIMPLE PRIVACY IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE TODAY. PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY GET IT. AND THEY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE FIGHT. NOW INDUSTRY ALSO SAT UP AND STARTED AYING ATTENTION WHEN THE CCPA CAME ON THE SCENE. YOU KNOW IT WAS AND IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. TOWARD TRULY IMPLEMENTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PRIVACY. ABOUT RIGHTS DON'T PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HERE BROKE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME AS WE GET BETTER AND BETTER AT THIS. I WANTED TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE POINTS OF THE IN SOME OF THE EARLIER -- COMMENTS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS AREAS DEALING WITH -- THE ISSUE OF THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL -- BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WAS THAT I FOUND INTERESTING LISTENING TO THE EARLIER PANEL WAS THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE. BEGINNING TO SAY NICE THINGS OR SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT THE GPR AT THE SAME TIME ABSORB CRITICIZING THE CCPA. AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK AT ON AN AREA LIKE ADVERTISING AS A BUSINESS MODEL YOU SEE THAT THE GPR IS ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW -- YOU KNOW REALLY PUTTING THAT ADVERTISING MODEL IN UNDER A LOT OF STRESS -- AND THIS IS THE A BIG CHANGE I MEAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW WE SAW A FRENCH REGULATOR THE NEIL -- IMPOSE UP FINDS ON ON GOOGLE FOR VIOLATIONS I THINK IT WAS FACEBOOK A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS. YOU KNOW NOW WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY EIGHT FIGURE FINDS UNDER GPR THAT IS REALLY. WHAT IS GETTING THEM TO TAKE NOTICE -- THERE WAS A RECENT MUCH MORE RECENT UP FINDING AGAINST A A COMPANY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF AND I'D NEVER HEARD OF VICTORIA -- WHERE THERE WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT CONSENT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN -- OBTAINED WHO THEY WERE -- WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY WERE SENDING OUT. AS PART OF THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY SORT OF REAL TIME BIDDING EXCHANGE. SO WE WE DON'T SEE HOW WHETHER YOU CALL IT SALES. OR SHARING -- AND WHY THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING SHARED AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT. THE GPR AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO ARE GOING TO BE A SPECIALLY FOR GIVING ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE WAS ALSO AN ISSUE WE'VE SEEN. ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER A ONE ON ONE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT THAT WAS. THERE SEEM TO BE A CONCERN THAT WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT BE A CONSUMER OF THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY YOU MIGHT HAVE A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM -- BUT IN FACT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT'S PART OF THE POINT RIGHT ON YOUR INFORMATION TRAVELS FROM THE COMPANIES YOU DO KNOW ABOUT. TO THE COMPANIES YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT -- AND AT THAT POINT -- UNDER EXISTING LOTS OF VERY VERY HARD TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND INDEED. WELL THE FACT THAT -- YOU KNOW AS NICK IS THAT. THE HOW CAN YOU DO ANYTHING TO SAY OPT OUT OF THE SALE THAT INFORMATION IF YOU DON'T KNOW. WHO THEY ARE AND THIS IS A PROBLEM I SEE IN THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH SOME UP FAMILIAR LARGE ACTORS LIKE DATA BROKERS -- LIKE EXPERIENCE LIKE EQUIFAX YOU KNOW WE ARE GENERALLY NOT. CUSTOMERS OF THEM THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR CLIENTS ARE OTHER BUSINESSES -- FOR THEM OUR DATA IS SIMPLY -- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THEM IT'S AND IT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE -- YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIMIT THE CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP TO JUST SOMEONE WAS A DIRECT. FACE TO FACE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THE THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION OF OF OCT IN VERSUS OPT OUT AND MAKE YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS TO SOME EXTENT BUT YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO AGREE THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT DRAWS THIS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT LINE. BETWEEN OPT IN AN OPT OUT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING VERY MUCH AT WE SPEECH RIGHTS WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW FREE SPEECH IS SOMETHING THAT IS ENJOYED. BY ALL SORTS OF ENTITIES UP BUT IT IS IT IS A NOT SO SIMPLE AS OPT OUT IS OKAY. OFTEN IS NOT -- ONE OF THE LEADING CASES FOR INSTANCE -- SO ROUTE WHICH AS A SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT -- YOU CAN'T HAVE OFTEN. I THINK THAT'S A VERY VERY DISTINGUISHABLE CASE -- IT IS IT DEALT WITH THE SALE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION IT WAS NOT EVEN TIED DIRECTLY. TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PATIENTS IN PRIVACY AND BACK WHEN IT WAS REALLY THE SPRING COURT WAS LOOKING AT QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THE PRESCRIBERS -- SHOULD HAVE PRIVACY SO I THINK THAT -- YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY ALIGNED ON THOSE KINDS OF CASES BUT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. I'M YOU KNOW THE BIGGER QUESTION. IS. WHO HAS THE BURDEN? ALL WHO IS BEARING THE COSTS. OF WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONSENT OPT IN OPT OUT -- BECAUSE NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CONSUMER. IN ORDER TO GET OUT. ACTUALLY INFORM THEMSELVES PAST DUE IN NORMAN WOULD HAVE TO DO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IS FULL OF STUDIES THAT TALK ABOUT. HOW MANY HOURS WOULD TAKE TO READ PRIVACY NOTICES CENTER IT'S SORT OF THE NOSE AND CHOICE MODEL IN THAT SORT OF PLANT? HAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT PUTS TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT ENOUGH ON THE COMPANIES WHO ARE IN FACT. THE ONES THAT KNOW WILL -- WHERE AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR INFORMATION AND WHERE IT GOES? INDEED THEY MAY ALSO BE THE ONLY ONES UNDER FORMS THAT THAT SEES A STARTED -- AND THAT WE WANT MORE OF RENTS SINCE -- I DON'T THINK THE CHAMBER UP THE LAST LETTER I THINK IN AUGUST THE THE CHAMBER WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE. OF THE IDEA OF SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION BEING GIVEN OUT -- AND YET. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THAT -- SOMEONE A SHARED YOUR BROWSING HISTORY -- AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE THE BROWSING HISTORY THAT THEY SHARE A MOCK MY MOTHER. HAS NO CONCEPT OF WHAT FOR BROWSING HISTORY CONTENT -- MOST PEOPLE DON'T THEY DON'T KNOW THAT LOCATION AND SHARED THEY DON'T KNOW THAT ALL SORTS OF OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT USE WHAT IS ACTUALLY AND THAT IT AND THE CLICK STREAM -- UP FURTHER MORE -- I THINK THE CHAMBERS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE CONCEPT OF INFERENCES AS SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO SHARE. AND YET I THINK MANY OF US WILL REMEMBER -- BEING SURPRISED WHEN -- THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE DID AN ARTICLE SEVERAL YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW -- TARGET WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT. A PREGNANCY ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE KINDS OF GOODS THAT PEOPLE WERE BUYING IT WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WITH SOME DEGREE OF ACCURACY -- WHEN A WOMAN WAS IN HER SECOND TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY? NOW. IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND. WHAT TARGET Y. TIGHT WITH INTERESTED IN THAT INFORMATION YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW WAS BEING USED AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE THREAT THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS VERY INNOCUOUS -- CAN BE IN THE HANDS OF LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF OF DATA MINING ABILITY -- SO WE THINK THAT. FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT -- FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO PROTECT OURSELVES -- FOR BEING ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY UNDERSTAND -- THE THREAT TO PRIVACY THE COMPANIES START POSING IT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE OF THESE KINDS OF OF PROTECTION. NOW I ALSO WANTED TO GO TO THE QUESTION WHAT FORCE MEANT -- AND AGAIN VERY SIMPLE WE SUPPORT STRONGLY -- THE NOTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- IN THE CCPA -- YOUNG WE AGREE WITH THE AG THAT EXPANDING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION MAKES SENSE -- IN FACT MANY PRIVACY STATUTES RIGHT NOW CAN LAWS ON WIRE TAPS STORED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. VIDEO RENTALS DRIVER'S LICENSES AND SO ON AND SO DO MANY OTHER KINDS OF LAWS. THAT PROTECT THE PUBLIC FEDERAL LAWS ON CLEAN WATER. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ACCESS TO RECORDS. ALSO YOU KNOW AGENCIES THEMSELVES -- EVEN THOUGH WE WE LOVE THE AGENT'S OFFICE BEING IN. CHARGE OF OF THE PRIVACY REGULATION HERE AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THEY HAVE A RESOURCE ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW THE FTC ITSELF YOU SEE DURING THE RECENT SHUT DOWN DOT PUT PAS. ON THEIR ATTEMPTS -- TO TO SANCTION OF FACEBOOK. THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK MORE OVER A REGULATORY CAPTURE -- WHEN YOU HAVE AN FORTUNATE CENTRALIZED? NOW ONE OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS WE SEEN GPR IS INCREDIBLY DECENTRALIZED REPORTING SYSTEM. NOT ONLY DPA SAID EVERY EVERY OTHER COUNTRY AND HOMBURG GERMANY DOES HAS ITS OWN DEEP YET -- SO THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENFORCEMENT POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE UNDER JEEP GPR AND MANY OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES HERE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF THOSE ALREADY AND WAS QUITE BEING REQUIRED. TO COMPLY. BUT WE THINK THAT WITH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE SORT OF THE PORTFOLIO NATURE OF ENFORCEMENT HE WON'T JUST BE ONE INCENTIVE THEY'LL BE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES -- AND THIS IS GOING TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANIES TO BE ACCOUNTABLE UP FROM THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY STANDPOINT -- I DON'T WANT TO BE -- I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE LAST POINT WHICH IS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PORTABILITY IN THE CURRENT LAW -- WE THINK THAT A PART OF OF REAL CONTROL OVER WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING IS THE ABILITY TO VOTE WITH YOUR FEET. IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A SERVICE CAN YOU TAKE YOUR DATA WITH THE OR WILL THEY ARE HOLDING HOSTAGE. ABOUT THE CZ PA A STARTED DOWN THIS PATH WITH A GOOD RIGHT TO POOR DATA PORTABILITY -- WE JUST WANT TO CLOSE A FEW LOOP THIS ISN'T JUST A PRIVACY ISSUE RIGHT I MEAN AS WE'VE SEEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ON THERE'S A LOT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMPETITIVE. ASPECTS HOW IS YOU KNOW IS THERE TOO MUCH MARKET POWER CONSTRICTED AND SOME COMPANIES. YOU KNOW THE FTC HAS AN ONGOING INQUIRY. AND I WAS HEARTENED TO SEE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CUNNINGHAM GALLAGHER MASON LACKEY RIGHT TO CONGRESS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE PREEMPTION ISSUE BUT ALSO ABOUT THE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE -- COMPETITIVE ISSUES FOR A LARGE TECH COMPANIES OF THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO LEAD THEIR THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PANELIST PLEASE. THE GERMAN SHALL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S TODD WE AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND TIME IN UNUSUAL WITNESS HERE TODAY. WELL MAYBE SITTING. SIDE BY SIDE WITH SOME IMPRESSIVE -- PRIVACY PROTECTION GROUPS I'M HERE IS A CEO OF A GROWING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BASED IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE CALLING FOR MUCH STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS -- STARTING WITH GIVING CONSUMERS THE POWER TO OPT IN. RATHER THAN OPT OUT OF SHARING THEIR PERSONAL DATA. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA'S EXTRAORDINARY TECH INDUSTRY. TO STOP HARVESTING AND SHARING OUR MOST PERSONAL PRIVATE DATA. WITH WITHOUT OUR MEANINGFUL CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE OR STRONGER PROTECTIONS ARE TOUGH TO IMPLEMENT. ST FILLED WITH WRONGDOERS COMPLAINING. THAT DOING RIGHT WILL PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS ONLY TO COMPLY AND THRIVE LEADER. INCIDENTALLY THE SAME TECH INDUSTRY COMPLAINED ABOUT EUROPE'S GPR. THAT CERTAINLY DID NOT PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE NEW LAW. OR STRONGER IS EASY TO TECHNICALLY COMPLY WITH. IF WE IF WE COMPANIES SIMPLY BEGIN TO HONOR OUR CUSTOMERS PRIVACY RIGHTS. AND DESIGNER SERVICES TO BE PRIVACY PROTECTING RATHER THAN PRIVACY EXPLOITING. I STARTED MY COMPANY PURISM. WHEN I CAME TO REALIZE THAT MY TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS? LIKE ALL CHILDREN. NEED CONVENIENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT PROTECT THEM. RATHER THAN EXPLOIT THEM. AS A TECHNOLOGIST. I UNDERSTAND PAINFULLY WELL. HOW MUCH THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR CAN EXPLOIT MY KIDS WITH THE THIS? THAT'S WHY STARTED THIS COMPANY FOUNDED ON PRIVACY PROTECTION PRINCIPLES. PURISM IS ALREADY MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA AND ASSEMBLING THESE LAPTOPS. AND OPERATING SYSTEM APPLICATIONS AND OF BUNDLED SERVICES OUT OF ALL SAN FRANCISCO IN CARLSBAD. WE MANUFACTURING THIS YEAR PRIVACY RESPECTING PHONE THE BUNDLE SERVICES THE COMPLY WITH AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALREADY. AND GO EVEN FURTHER WITH OFTEN BY DEFAULT FOR ALL OFFERED SERVICES. WE'VE BEEN GROWING TRIPLE DIGITS ANNUALLY REFLECTING THE HUGE BUILT UP CONSUMER DEMAND FROM PARENTS AND PROFESSIONALS. JUST LIKE YOU. WHO SIMPLY WANT TO KEEP THEIR AND THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES PRIVATE AND SECURE? THIS IS DONE BY SIMPLE APPROACH. THIS CALL PRIVACY BY DESIGN. AS AB THREE TWENTY FIVE SIX TO MAKE CLEAR PRIVACY IS A RIGHT. AND YOUR EVERY LOCATION IN EVERY COMMUNICATION AND EVERY WEB PAGE AND EVERY SEARCH STORED PERMANENTLY. SHOULD NOT BE EXPLOITED. TO USE NEEDED SERVICES ONLINE. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THE TIME IS COME FOR CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE BACK THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY ON THE INTERNET. AND URGE YOU TO SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHEN THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE FOR YOU AND MY CHILDREN SAKE. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH AN NEXT PANELIST PLEASE. SO MANY SCOTT JORDAN I HIS BACKGROUND I SERVED AS THE FCC'S CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST FROM. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS PART OF THAT I WORKED ON THE FCC'S BROADBAND PRIVACY ORDER. I'M A PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE I'M NOT A LAWYER WAS HAPPY TO HELP YOU OUT ON TCPA LAST YEAR. AND OF THE CCB IS A GREAT START AND WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY. ON THE GOALS OF TCPA. OUR USERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CHOICE. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO BRING THIS KIND OF BACK UP TO THE TWENTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL AND THINK BACK TO WHAT WE'RE OUR GOALS HERE. SO WE'RE GOALS WERE THAT USERS HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EXERCISE YOUR CHOICES. SO NOT START WITH A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES SO LET'S SUPPOSE YOUR USER OF GOOGLE MAPS. AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE GOOGLE MAPS ACCESS TO YOUR LOCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT THE MAPS GOING TO GIVE YOU FOR THAT. TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS. BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR GOOGLE TO SELL THAT INFORMATION OR SHARE THAT INFORMATION TO SOME OUTSIDE PARTY THERE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRACK IT. SO COMPLETELY REASONABLE CHOICE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SECOND EXAMPLE -- YOU HAVE YOUR I SP THAT YOU USE TO ACCESS THE INTERNET AT HOME. DAY YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO ON THE INTERNET SO THEY CAN GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND BRING THE CONTENT BACK TO YOU. IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT YOU DON'T WANT THEM OR EXPECT THEM TO USE IT. TO DO ADVERTISING THAT YOU SEE IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE SERVICE TO TRIPPING THE POOR. SO WHAT IS THE RESEARCH I AM AN ACADEMIC I GOT TO BRING THIS AND SO THE RESEARCH SAYS CONSUMERS LOOK AT IT GENERALLY IS A TRADE OFF. ACCESS TO CERTAIN OUT OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION WE'RE REALLY FACING HIM WE'VE BEEN FACING. ON THIS ALL ALONG. ONE OR USERS OFFERED MEANINGFUL CHOICES CAN THEY EXERCISE MEANINGFUL CHOICES OVER HOW MUCH OF MY INFORMATION WHAT FUNCTIONALLY DO I GUESS. AND SECOND TO THE AT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO DECIDE. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO VISIT THOSE AND SUGGEST A COUPLE OF REFINEMENTS. SO MANY START WITH USER CHOICE. SO WE LOOK AT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THREE BUCKETS AND PEOPLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT BUT I JUST WANT. TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT TO IT SO ONE BUCKET IS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO A USE THE SERVICE THE SECOND ONE IS OPT OUT THE DEFAULT IS THEY CAN USE IT BUT YOU CAN EXERCISE THE CHOICE NOT. TO THE THIRD ONE OUT TO THE PEOPLE OF IN TALKING ABOUT. SO THE QUESTION THE WORLD FACING THE TEACHER STRUGGLING WITH THIS WHICH BUCKETS APPROPRIATE FOR WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION. SO LET ME BRING IN WHAT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT USE YOUR EXPECTATIONS DEPEND VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT WHY WAS I GIVEN THIS INFORMATION WHAT IS GOING TO BE USED. FOR SO WHEN DATE IS USED IN CONTEXT PARTICULARLY IT'S REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE SERVICE. THEN IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT IS IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE IS AN OPT OUT IT'LL COME BACK TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE. BUT THEN THE RESEARCH SAYS IF THE INFORMATION IS BEING USED OUT OF CONTEXT. THE USER WANTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT TO SEE THE DECISION A NEW MEANS. I KNEW. TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT INFORMATION OF A PROVIDING AND WHEN I GET BORED. AND THAT TRANSLATES TALKED AND SO WHATEVER COURAGE YOU IN LOOKING AT THESE DEBATES THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ALL DAY TODAY ON OFTEN VERSUS OPT OUT VERSUS TERMS CONDITIONS. TO LOOK AT IT IN THAT WAY IT'S WHAT WITH THE USER EXPECTATION BE IN CONTEXT SO A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE I SP EXAMPLE THEY NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE I WANT TO GO ON THE INTERNET IP ADDRESSES TO GET ME THERE. THAT'S PART OF THE SERVICE THEY CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT IT VERY NATURALLY I HAVE AGREED TO THAT IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THAT'S WHAT I'M PAYING THEM. FOR BUT IF THEY WANT TO USE IT FOR BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING THAT SHOULD BE A NEW DECISION. THAT SHOULD BE OFTEN I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION I LIKE THE RIVER LABORATORIES AND OR I DON'T PEOPLE DISAGREE ON THAT. BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION SO WHAT DOES HE CPA SAY ABOUT THIS. SO WHAT IT SAYS IS IT'S AS IF IT'S A BUSINESS PURPOSE OR DE IDENTIFIED. THEN IT'S PART OF TERMS CONDITIONS MAKES PERFECT SENSE. AND THEN IT SAYS IT'S NOT A BUSINESS PURPOSE AND IT'S IDENTIFIABLE PI MINUTES OPT OUT. THE BUSINESS PURPOSE CONSTRUCT IS A REALLY GOOD CONSTRUCT. AND THERE'S A LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE IN CCPA THE RELATE SAID CUT TO CONTEXT BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. SO IT HAS THE RIGHT IDEA BUT I WANT TO A FINE MAN. LET'S GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND WE USE THE I SP EXAMPLE ACCOUNT. SO THE I. S. P.'S SEE WHERE I GO ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE. TO THEY CAN USE THAT TO CREATE A PROFILE -- WHAT INTEREST I HAVE THEY CAN THEN SELL AD PLACEMENT BASED ON THE PROFILE? INCLUDING GO TO BILLION THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION RIGHT -- THEY WILL SAY THEY DON'T SELL THE RAW DATA AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T TELL THE RAW DATA BUT THEY ARE ENABLING THIS BE HERE FOREVER TIES IT IT'S OUT OF CONTEXT. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCEPTABLE THAT I DON'T HAVE AN OPTION TO SAY YES OR NO TO THAT THAT'S A NEW DECISION. SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION THE SOLUTION IS WHAT A FEW OF THE FOLKS TALKED ABOUT CCPA HAS IN A CAN SENT OVER SHARING. BUT EVERY OTHER PRIVACY FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE USED HERE WHAT THE F. T. C.'S DONE WHAT THE FCC'S DONE. WHAT CHIEF YOURS DONE TALKS NOT JUST ABOUT SHARING THE COLLECTION AND USE I WANT TO MAKE THE DECISION DO I WANT THEM TO COLLECT THAT DATA? AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT BASED ON WHAT FUNCTIONALITY I'M GOING TO GO. SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT -- WE SHOULD INCLUDE COLLECTION AND USE IN THERE WHENEVER IT'S OUT OF CONTEXT WHENEVER IT'S NOT PART OF THE BUSINESS PURPOSE. OKAY SECOND REFINEMENT. HOW TO GET BACK INTO THIS OPTION VERSUS OPT OUT? SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM THE CONSUMER POINT OF VIEW. BETWEEN EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN USING AN I. S. P. USING RIGHT ON THAT ARE FOR PEOPLE ADVERTISING AND LET ME GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE. SO SKYPE WHAT I USE SKYPE IT MAY ONE ACCESS TO MY ADDRESS BOOK -- I MAY WANT TO SAY YES I MAY WANT TO SAY NO I'M GONNA VIEW THAT LIKELY ISN'T IN CONTEXT. IT ONCE IT BECAUSE IF I GIVE IT ACCESS I WON'T HAVE TO DIAL THE NUMBER I CAN JUST PULL IT UP. ON MIGHT MAKE A DECISION YES TO MAKE IMAGES YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT TOP DOWN [inaudible] I THINK. SCRIBE GOES A STEP FURTHER CHOOSES TO MAKE IT UP. TO BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BEING OPT OUT THIS IS SOME CONTEXT. SO I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO GUIDE YOUR DECISIONS COMING FORWARD ABOUT HOW TO REFINE. SO CONVINCED SUMMARY TERMS AND CONDITIONS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE WHEN IT'S REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE SERVICE I'VE AGREED TO IT WHEN I SIGNED UP FOR THE SERVICE. UP DOWN WHEN IT GIVES ME ADDED FUNCTIONALITY BUT IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT EXPECT THIS CAP OR SERVICE TO DO. AN OPT OUT WHEN IT'S PART OF CONTEXT AND SHOULD BE A NEW -- TO I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE PART THAT I SKIPPED MY YOU'VE SHOULD EXPECT ME TO DO FIRST IS DO YOU WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT. IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. SO CCPA ON USE TOOK A GOOD STEP IT SAID YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED AND THE PURPOSES. SO AN EXAMPLE AND I'LL COME BACK TO THE I. S. P. AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR I. S. P.'S PRIVACY POLICY. IT WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IT UP ONE SECTION THAT SAYS INFORMATION WE COLLECT. END OF A LONG LIST BUT ONE OF THE THINGS IN THERE IS WHERE YOU GO ON THE INTERNET. ANOTHER THING IS GOING TO BE YOUR ZIP CODE OF WHERE YOU LIVE. THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY THE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED. AND ONE THING IN THERE IS GOING TO BE TO ROUTE SURE TRAFFIC WANTED OR THE NOTION OTHER. IN ANOTHER ONE MAYBE IT IS VERY LIKELY TO BE WE USE SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION FOR ADVERTISING. THIS IS ALL GOOD INFORMATION. BUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW IS IS MY I. S. P. USING WHERE I GO ON THE INTERNET FOR ADVERTISING. I KNOW THE COLLECTING AT ANOTHER USING SOMETHING FOR ADVERTISING I REALLY WANT TO HEAR THE TWO TOGETHER SO I CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL CHOICE OF SAY YES I LIKE THAT OR NO I DON'T LIKE THAT. SO SOLUTION REFINEMENT THAT I'D SUGGEST -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT TCPA DID OF DISCLOSING CATEGORIES. AND PURPOSES WE SHOULD PAIR THEM TOGETHER THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE THE PURPOSE FOR EVERY CATEGORY THAT THEY COLLECT. SO THAT AN ICE PICK AND SAY WE USE WERE YOU GO ON THE INTERNET FOR BEAVER ADVERTISING. HORSE OF THE CAN SEE NOW WE DON'T USE WHERE YOU GO ON THE INTERNET PROVIDER TIES AND WE JUST USE IT TO GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. OKAY -- ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT TO HEAR AN INFORMATION IS SHARED SO CCPA AGAIN TAKES A GOOD STEP. THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD KNOW THE CATEGORIES INFORMATION THAT ARE SHARED. AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES THAT IT SHARED WITH. SO WE HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM THAT WAS TOUCHED ON BEFORE. IS YOUR I. S. P. IS LIKELY TO SAY WE DO SHARE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION DERIVED FROM WHERE YOU GO ON THE INTERNET. NOT THE RAW DATA BUT SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS ADVERTISERS. THEN WE SHARE YOUR ZIP CODE. AND THEN A SEPARATE SECTION THEY'LL SAY WE SHARE WITH RESEARCHERS AND WE SHARE WITH ADVERTISERS. OKAY GREAT BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS JUST BY I. S. P. SHARED INFORMATION DERIVED FROM WHERE I GO ON THE INTERNET WITH ADVERTISERS. OR THEY JUST SHARING OF THE RESEARCHERS. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BIG DIFFERENCE AND I MAY WANT TO SAY YES TO ONE ANOTHER THE OTHER. SO THAT'S ANOTHER REFINEMENT THAT WE CAN TAKE IS TO SAY. TELL ME THIS PARENTS. TELL ME WITH WHO YOU SHARE WHAT YOU SHARE WITH THEM. I WANT TO BRIEFLY JUST HIT ON A COUPLE OF OTHER ASPECTS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT INSPECTION AND DELETION -- I JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS ANOTHER WEEK PART. THAT WE CAN IMPROVE. IT SAID THAT WE HAD TO THE INTENT THAT WE KNOW THAT MY INFORMATION PROPAGATE SHOULD THE ECO SYSTEM -- I'M NOT TRYING TO AVOID THAT BUT IN ORDER. TO EXERCISE MY RIGHTS I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK WHO DID IT GO. TO IN I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK WHERE DID IT COME FROM. AND THERE'S SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT. BUT IF WE REALLY WANT USERS TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THESE RIGHTS. THEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM BOTH WHERE DID IT GO TO LIST PARTIES. AND WHEN I KNOW WHAT THIRD PARTY HAS SOME OF MY INFORMATION. WHERE DID IT COME FROM SAID I CAN GO BACK TO TURN THE KNOB IF I WANT TO SAY YES OR NO? SO I CAN TURN THAT BACK OFF I WANT TO TURN THEM BACK OFF -- ON THE COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED I'M NOT GONNA HELP EXPLICIT ADVICE HERE. BUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO INFORM THE DISCUSSION. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IDENTIFIED ABOUT ANONYMOUS ON THE THE NEXT PANELIST WILL ADD MORE DETAIL TO IT BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT. SO THE CONCEPT OF DE IDENTIFIED THE TEST THAT YOU PUT IN C. C. P. EIGHT IS THE RIGHT TEST. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE IN THERE. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO CONFUSE WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY CAME FROM AND HOW IT'S BEING DISCUSSED. IT CAME FROM HAVING DATA SETS LIKE LIST OF HEALTH OUTCOMES YOU KNOW A FIFTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MALE. HAD THE FOLLOWING MEDICAL ISSUE NO NAME NO IDENTITY ATTACHED. GREAT BUT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET. DON'T THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT SHOWED UP. ON LIKE CLAIMS YOU HEARD EARLIER DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. THAT AND IN ORDER TO BE PLACED ON THERE HAS YOUR I. P. ADDRESS THAT CAN BE CONNECTED WITH ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. IN THAT AD ITSELF CAN COLLECT MORE INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT HAS SOFTWARE CODE BEHIND IT THEY CAN COLLECT MORE. SO DE IDENTIFIED IS A GREAT THING A BLIGHTED TODAY ARE JUST I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT THAT SOLVES THE ADVERTISING ISSUES THAT A DISCUSSED. WOULD HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP SLASH VERY LAST POP UP TO TAKE. AND I JUST WANT AGAIN LEAVE YOU WITH SOMETHING TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT CAN DISCUSS IT MORE LATER. WHICH IS THERE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES FROM COMPANIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM EVEN HERE. FULL NAME SO -- APPLE GOOGLE THAT DON'T JUST GIVE THESE BIG LONG LEGAL PRIVACY POLICIES THESE DAYS THE THE SECOND VERSION IT'S MEANT TO BE REALLY. USEFUL AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT HAS EMBEDDED IN THEIR THE CONTROLS RECKON TOWARD THINGS ON OR OFF. AND THEY'RE GREAT EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT SO TAKING THE CHAIRMAN'S GUIDANCE FROM THE BEGINNING. THIS IS REALLY ALL THINGS WHERE I THINK BOTH THE BUSINESS BICU AND THE CONSUMER YOU FUTURE LINE. THEY SHOULD WANT ME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS INFORMED CHOICES. AND WE SEE SOME EXAMPLES BUT THEY DO A GREAT JOB OF IT -- HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THANKS VERY MUCH IN NEXT PANELIST. I APOLOGIZE WE CAN RUNNING -- SHORT ON TIME SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. ON WHEN IS ASH HUSTLE TINY I'M INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER AND CONSULTANT IN THE SPACE ABOUT TWO DECADES OF EXPERIENCE WITH PRIVACY AND SECURITY INCLUDING BUILDING -- SECURED ARCHITECTURES FOR LARGE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING EIGHTEEN T. AND GOVERNMENTS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- I WORKED AS AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST LOOKING AT ONLINE PRIVACY FOR A GOOD PART OF MY CAREER AND HELP FIND. EXAMPLES OF COMPANIES IS ESSENTIALLY DECEIVING SEE CHOICES FOR WHICH I WAS A PULITZER FINALIST ALSO WORKED AS A PRIMARY -- ONE OF THE FIRST TECHNOLOGIES A TOUGH TO SEE AND WORKED UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER UNDER AND THIS COMPUTER NOW UNDER CONSENT AGREE AS A RESULT. AND IT WORKED LEADERS THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST FOR THE F. T. C. LOOKING AT THEIR POLICY ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS AS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY ON THEIR EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE LOOKING A PRIVACY -- I THINK -- KIND OF IN SHORT. I WANTED TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF WHAT THE PALACE PUT PRIOR TO ME SAID SAY AND WHILE THIS AREA IS VERY COMPLICATED. I THINK I DON'T THINK CCPA ACTUALLY IS ALL THAT COMPLICATED -- IT'SA VERY NARROW POLICY FRAMEWORK PERMITTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY. TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT PRIVACY FOR MARK IN THE U. S. WERE -- THE FTC'S AUTHORITY FOR EXAMPLE UNDER SECTION FIVE WHICH GOVERNS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES. IT'S OFTEN BASED ON WHAT STATEMENTS COMPANIES MAKE TO CONSUMERS AND WHETHER THOSE STATEMENTS ARE DECEPTIVE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH A FRAMEWORK IS THAT AS OTHER PANELS OF HIGHLIGHTED -- WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH A WEBSITE YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PARTIES AND DATA BROKERS OR YOU KNOW AND -- ACT WITH A PHYSICAL STORE THEY HAD IT ALL IRAQ WITH THOSE NOTICES AND IT'S AWARE THAT -- THE FTC WILL GO AND FORCE UNDER THESE THESE THIRD PARTY NOTICES BECAUSE SOME ARGUE WHETHER THEIR MATERIAL. AS A RESULT OF CONSUMERS NOT SEEING THAT. RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FTC DATA BROKE REPORT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THESE GAPS AND POLICY. AND SO WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CITY PAY FOCUSES ON EXACTLY THESE THIRD PARTIES ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO THE OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THESE INFORMATION TO THESE THIRD PARTIES. AND FOCUSES KIND OF OTHER ENFORCEMENT REGIMES AROUND THE FIRST PARTY INTERACTION WITH STAFF TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE CAN GOVERN I THINK QUITE WELL. AND THIS PANEL AS AS IS DUBBED KIND WHAT'S BEYOND TO CPA EVEN DOT ONLY HEARD OF A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES LIKE FACE RECOGNITION GEO LOCATION. A AYE INFERENCE BIAS ALL OF THESE ARE -- SO PRIVACY ISSUES AND EVEN NOT ONLY HEARD THAT CONGRESS AND OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT THIS WHAT I'M AFRAID IS THAT -- GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF OTHER TOPICS THAT FALL UNDER THE PRIVACY AND BROTHER I'LL SUCH AS A AYE BIAS. WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY GET IN THE U. S. AS A FRAMER IS GOING TO BE A NOTHER KIND OF NOTICE AND CHOICE FRAMEWORK THAT REQUIRES CONSUMERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAY COMPANIES USE INFORMATION I SHARE THE INFORMATION IS ADEQUATE? AND I THINK WHY THAT'S CHALLENGING AS AGAIN AS WE'VE HEARD -- AN A I CAN MAKE AN AND FRIENDS OR KIND OF MACHINE LEARNING CAN MAKE INFERENCES THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. SO I THINK IT'S A POINT TO THINK ABOUT THIS PRIVACY LAW AND ENOUGH IN THE IN THAT CONTEXT WHERE WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING DOWN THE PIKE BUT I THINK WHAT WILK END UP GETTING IS MORE OF THE SAME AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET. SOMETHING LIKE A EUROPEAN STYLE SO WHAT THIS LOT PROTECTS AREAS WHERE THE KERN FORCES DON'T HAVE -- A KIND OF A LOT OF AUTHORITY OR DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EFFECTIVENESS. ON THE OTHER. KRYCEKI'VE HEARD IS THAT -- THERE'S OF BIGNESS IN THAT CITY PAY THE MAKES AN UNTENABLE YOU'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF STRAW MAN ARGUMENTS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE AG REQUIRING COMPANIES TO RESPONSE ON AUTHENTICATED. USER REQUESTS RIGHT AND AND AND GIVE OVER -- KIND OF INFORMATION CONSUMERS THAT AREN'T WHO THEY REPORT TO BE -- I THINK THOSE COMMENTS ARE KIND OF A LITTLE BIT IT -- DECEIVING AND AND NOT REALLY EFFECTIVE DATE WE LEFT A LOT HELPED WITH -- CONSOLE WITH -- MR TAGGART AND OF SPOKE THE RAGS PRECISELY BECAUSE IT'S AN INCREDIBLY TECHNICAL FIELD AND IN THE COSTS INVOLVING SO. LEAVING IT UP TO THE AG TO DEFINE FOR EXAMPLE VERIFIABLE USER REQUEST I THINK IS CRITICAL AND THAT ALLOWS THE STANDARD TO EVOLVE OVER TIME IN FIVE YEARS WILL LIKELY NOT EVEN BE USING USERNAMES PASSWORDS. SO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AUTHENTICATED USER IS GOING TO CHANGE OVER TIME AND YOU WANT TO ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY. RIGHT AT ROOM -- UNDERSTANDABLY COME COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED THAT THOSE ROADS AREN'T FURNISHED BUT I THINK -- I WOULD TRUST THE PETE THE GOOD PEOPLE AT THE AG TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND AND THINK THROUGH THESE HARD ISSUES AND PROVIDE -- SENSIBLE GUIDE THIS GUIDE AND GUIDANCE AND ADDITIONALLY -- REGARDING THE GUIDANCE -- TO REGARDING THE CONCERNED BY THE AGE OF HAVING TO RESPOND TO CAN THE COMPANIES REQUEST FOR DIRECT GUIDANCE I THINK IT'S MERITED BUT I MIGHT SUGGEST LOOKING AT THE FTC'S DCV THE DIVISION OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS EDUCATION. IN THE WAYS THEY PROVIDE PUBLIC GUIDANCE AND HOW RESOURCE AND MAYBE ONE A RESOURCE STAGE YOU TO DO THIS BETTER BUT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC GUIDANCE IN AND AROUND THESE ISSUES LIKE AN FAQ. RATHER THAN DOING SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO SEE -- FINALLY I THINK THE BIGGEST POINT OF CONTENTION AND YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF OF IT TODAY TOUCHED -- IS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF SUIT IDENTIFIERS AND AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PERSONAL INFORMATION -- WE'VE HEARD A AND I'VE SEEN THE CHAMBER IN OTHER LETTERS ARGUE THAT PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS ARE PSEUDONYMOUS TRACKING IS NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHAT WE MEAN BY PSEUDONYMOUS TRACKING IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT YOUR NAME SO. ASSIGNING JUST AN IDENTIFIER A RANDOM STRING OF NUMBERS TO LIKE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS A PSEUDO IDENTIFIER RIGHT IT REFERS TO UNIQUELY AND IDENTIFIES A PARTICULAR CONSUMER NOT A WOMAN IN THE ROOM BECAUSE I WON IDENTIFY MAYBE FIFTY CONSUMERS. BUT WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO QUE OF ZERO ONE WHEN IT DEFIES ONE PERSON THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND ANOTHER ANOTHER KIND OF SOMETIMES IDENTIFIERS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR SOMETIMES AND MORE OFTEN THE THE WAY -- KIND OF THAT THE DATA BURKE INDUSTRY WORKS IS THAT BASED ON WHAT ARE KNOWN AS HASHED IDENTIFIERS AND A HASH IS JUST A MATHEMATIC MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATION OF A SET OF NUMBERS ARE CHARACTERS. SO IF YOU'RE MEMBER -- CRACKER JACKS LITTLE ROTATOR RING AN OLD CRACKED CRACKER JACKS -- THAT -- BOXES WHERE YOU COULD SEE CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR FRIENDS THOUSAND EXAMPLE OF THE WEEK CASH WAS CALLED A ROTATION HASH OF ONE SO -- HAD CHAO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE SOME AND I CAN REFER TO YOU AS THAT AND AND NIKKI COULD REFER TO IS THAT WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU LIKE YOUR BROWSING HISTORY OR WHAT STORIES YOU'VE BEEN TO AND NEVER REFER TO BY NAME. BUT IT IS EFFECTIVELY A SERVING THE SAME PERSON AT THE SAME PURPOSES REFERRING TO BY NAME I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT -- HE'D NEED DON'T SWEEP AND SIT ON SYNONYMOUS TRACKING AS AN EXEMPTION LIKE YOU DO DE IDENTIFIED DATA BECAUSE THEY MEAN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE THE PRIMARY WAY THAT THE INDUSTRY EXCHANGES DATA FOR EXAMPLE WHEN. YOU GO INTO -- CVS AND PURCHASE A RAZOR BLADE AND BETA USING YOUR LOYALTY CARD AND FACEBOOK IS THAT ABLE TO REPORT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE SAW. HAD FOR RAZORBLADE WALKED IN AND BOUGHT THE RAZOR BLADE WHICH IS A SERVICE THAT THEY OFFER THROUGH THE SERVICE HOW THE LOGICS IT'S DONE THROUGH THE SUIT DENTIFIERS USUALLY. A PSEUDONYM OR A HASH OF YOUR EMAIL. RIGHTS I THINK IT'S CRITICAL -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET SWEPT UP AS AN EXEMPTION. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK THE THE I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I'M HONORED TO AND I NOTE A BIT OF TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] INTEREST THE SOPHISTICATION OF ONLINE TRACKING AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF DATA EXCHANGES -- ARE ARE MORE AND MORE -- INCREASINGLY TECHNICAL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE KIND OF TECHNICAL AS AN ADDITION TO LAWYERS AND POLICY MAKERS HELPING YOU SIFT THROUGH THESE THINGS AND SO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT PANELIST PLEASE. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHALLEN MEMBERS I'LL BE BRIEF -- GIVEN THE TIME I JUST THINK SERRA BOAT WITH CAL CHAMBER JUST. REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE LITERALLY PASSED WHAT HAS BEEN DUBBED THE MOST ROBUST PRIVACY LAW IN THE COUNTRY -- IT STILL HAS ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE SORTED THROUGH IT STILL HAS REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED REGULATIONS THAT WE HOPE MIGHT OFFER BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THIS VERY COMPLEX LOG -- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH THIS LINE AS WE DISCUSSED IT'S GONNA INCLUDE GROCERY STORES RESTAURANTS ALL KINDS OF OTHER BUSINESSES INCLUDING BUSINESSES WITH VERY SLIM PROFIT MARGINS. WE'VE YET TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THE CPA ON STATE'S ECONOMY. WE'VE YET TO SEE JUST HOW MANY HOW MUCH. pTHIS LAW WILL RAISE PRICES FOR CONSUMERS AND WHAT IS ALREADY A VERY INCREDIBLE STATE EXPENSIVE STATE. THERE ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE WEIGHED BY CALIFORNIANS BEFORE WE ADD EVEN MORE ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS ON TOP OF THE CPA. ALREADY TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER SO I'LL JUST MENTION IT BRIEFLY -- HERE. ADDING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE THIS SEATING FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND FOR OUR ECONOMY. SO. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S FIXING THE CZ P. A. R. WORK IS NOT DONE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT BUSINESSES CAN ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH IT? AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SET UP. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES FOR SUCCESS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH IT -- THE NEXT PANELIST -- MISS FOR SHADE WAS A PRIVACY LAW COMPLIANCE EXPERT IS PROBABLY GONNA RESPOND TO SOME POINTS REYES AND SHE'S ALSO GOING TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR EVERYONE. KNEW JUST WHAT CALIFORNIA BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO COMPLY WITH THIS LOT. AND I WANT. MEMBERS I ASK MEMBERS TO RECALL THAT THE THE HANDFUL OF THE TECH GIANT'S AT A MET BEEN MENTIONED OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PANEL. COMPRISE JUST A FRACTION OF THE BUSINESSES THAT MUST COMPLY WITH THIS LONG WE ASK YOU TO PLEASE KEEP IN MIND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THE MID SIZE THE SMALLER COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPLY. WITH THIS LAWS WHEN IT COMES INTO EFFECT CAR DEALERS REAL ESTATE AGENTS RESTAURANTS I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND WE ASK THAT YOU KEEP THAT IN YOUR MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS THANK YOU SO MUCH. TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT POINT PANELS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WANNA KEEP THIS BRIEF GUIDE. I HOPE THIS WORKS [inaudible] FIVE LISTEN I THINK ULTIMATELY WE DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT A LOT OF THE OBJECTIVES HERE RATE -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS RIGHT TO PRIVACY I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M A CONSUMER. TO I HAVE CHILDREN AND I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT I'VE BEEN PROTECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA IF OF PRIVACY. RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION ACTUALLY SINCE I WAS BORN WERE THE SAME AGE I'M PROUD THAT I'VE GROWN UP WITH IT OKAY. I'M GLAD THAT MY KIDS ARE PROTECTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THE GIVES MINERS THE RATE TO GET THEIR INFORMATION REMOVED FROM -- SERVICES ONLINE I AM REALLY -- IMPRESSED WITH THE SHINE THE LIGHT LAW AND I THINK IT GIVES CONSUMERS ACTUALLY PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH ME BUT I THINK IT'S CONSUMERS QUITE ROBUST RIGHT. TO EXERCISE CERTAIN CHOICES I AM SURPRISED THAT CONSUMERS DON'T DO IT MORE OFTEN THAN THEY DO AND I KNOW BECAUSE I RESPOND TO THOSE REQUESTS WHEN MY CLIENTS GET THEM. IN MY COLLEAGUES TO COMPLY WITH THE SHINE THE LIGHT LAW SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING BUT WE'RE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW. THERE'S ALSO EXISTING LAWS THAT PROTECT AGAINST THE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IN HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT IN LENDING IN INSURANCE UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT UNDER THE EQUAL -- EMPLOYMENT ACT FEDERAL LAWS ALSO STATE LAWS THAT THAT ARE PROTECT EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT OF LAWS THAT ALREADY GIVE CALIFORNIANS A LOT OF PROTECTION AND RIGHTS. IS THERE A SAID. THIS IS A BROAD BASED LAW THAT HITS THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY YOU KEEP HEARING THE SAME NAMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. GOOGLE FACEBOOK DATA BROKERS TECH BIG TACK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE'S THIS HUGE OFF IN THE ROOM THE NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE ALL THESE BUSINESSES. THEY'RE IMPACTED. THE DEBT IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY MANY OF THOSE CONSUMER FACING BUSINESSES WHO ARE THE ONES CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING THOSE RIGHTS THOSE NOTICE AND CHOICE RIGHT. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW A LOT OF THE TIME WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ASKING THEM. TO COMPLY WITH ALL THESE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THE ECOSYSTEM IS DOING. ITS AN ECOSYSTEM ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY IS AN ECOSYSTEM. I WANT TO GET MY NEWS NOT JUST FROM GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK I WANNA GET MY NEWS FROM ALL KINDS OF PUBLISHERS BUT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO THE SAME AD TECH ECOSYSTEM WHICH IS IMPACTED BY THIS LAW. AND SO YOU'VE TOO MANY PLAYERS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH ALL THESE INCONSISTENT OVERLAPPING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOT TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS IN THE SYSTEM. DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TECHNOLOGY BASED BUT DOES AFTER WRECKING THIS ECOSYSTEM. SO. IF YOU WANT US TO BE ABLE TO DE IDENTIFY DATA. THEN TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY YOU CAN DE IDENTIFY THE DATA AND HOW WOULD BE NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION IF YOU THEN TURN AROUND AND SAY WE CAN'T REALLY DE IDENTIFIED WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY. BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THERE'S NO WAY TO DO IT. BY DE IDENTIFICATION. PRIVACY IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS AND BUSINESSES ARE WORKING REALLY HARD UNDER EXISTING LAW ON BEST PRACTICES TO DO RIGHT BY CONSUMERS. THERE ARE EXISTING CHOICES UNDER THE NA I AND AD CHOICES SELF REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS USERS CAN IN FACT ALREADY CHOOSE NOT TO BE TRACKED BY THIRD PARTIES ON WEBSITES. THAT EXISTS THEY JUST HAVE TO CLICK THROUGH TO THOSE OPTIONS THERE'S A LITTLE ICON ON THE THIS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PLAYERS BEHIND THE SCENES IS IT PERFECT. NO MOST THINGS AREN'T. BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS IN PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE TOLD THEY DON'T HAVE OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY DO. SO -- THERE IS ALREADY AS WELL AS BEEN MENTIONED FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION GUIDANCE ON DATA BROKERS AND HAD DATA BROKERS CAN WORK TO DE IDENTIFY INFORMATION AND TO PROVIDE DIRECT CHOICES TO CONSUMERS AND THAT'S WHY COMPANIES LIKE AXIOM ALREADY DO THAT. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT CONSUMER FACING IN ORDER THE CONSUMERS CAN OBTAIN THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. WHERE WE GOING IN THE FUTURE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN -- IT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THIS YEAR AND PROBABLY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GONNA SEE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. SPENDING THEIR TIME AND THEIR MONEY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS LAW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THIS DATA IS AND REMEMBER IT'S ALL THE DATA. CONNECTED WITH CONSUMERS CONNECTED WITH HOUSEHOLDS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASSUME IT CAN BE IDENTIFIED IF THE DEFINITION IS CAPABLE OF BEING IDENTIFIED CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH. AND I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I SAW IT SOMEWHERE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I NOTED THAT DOES NOT COME OUT OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. THERE IS SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT I THINK IT'S EIGHT OH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S BEEN SIGHTED IN SOME THE MATERIALS THAT RELATES TO THE DISPOSAL Là UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT DEFINITION THAT BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ONLY RELATES TO DATA DISPOSAL IT IS NOT AN EXISTING LAW. IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS WERE SHINE THE LIGHT LAW OR ANY OF THOSE OTHER THINGS SO I JUST WANTED TO SPELL THAT MATH. THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE UNDERTAKING FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THOSE ARE THE SAME CONSUMERS WERE TRYING TO PROTECT SO THEY ARE BOTH CONSUMERS. WHO WE DO NEED TO PROTECT I WANT TO CHECK MY KIDS MY PARENTS PEOPLE DON'T UDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL I WANT TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS ON WHAT THEIR EXACT EXISTING RATES ARE? BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT. AND DO THAT THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF PRIVACY PROTECTION THAT USED TO EXIST DOESN'T ANYMORE DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE SHOULD DO THAT. BUT WE ALSO REMEMBER THOSE PEOPLE OF DROPS IN THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS LAW AND WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE. TO TURN THEMSELVES UPSIDE DOWN POSSIBLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY GET STUDENT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. FOR NOT HAVING QUOTE REASONABLE SECURITY WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN ACCOMPLISH THAT AND THEY GET STUCK WITH A FISHING ATTACK. THOSE PEOPLE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF COMPANIES ARE GONNA GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE ASSIGN RESOURCES JUST TO DEAL. WITH THE CCPA EVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM. SO LET'S USE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO GET IT RIGHT. TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE RIGHTS THE ALREADY HAVE UNDER EXISTING LAWS TO MAKE THIS THE BEST POSSIBLE. LEADING STATE LAW IN THE NATION. WHICH IT SHOULD BE WITHOUT DAMAGING THE ENTIRE CONTENT. THANKS VERY MUCH. DO YOU HAVE A REAL QUICK WITHOUT GET COULD JUST DON'T MAKE MAKE A QUICK COMMENT ON THIS POINT REGARDING SMALL BUSINESSES AND MOM AND POP STORES. SO SO. IN TODAY'S AGE IT'S RARE TO HAVE A BUSINESS THAT MEETS THE THRESHOLD THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME ONLINE PRESENCE OF SOME SORT AND MORE AND MORE. ON AYE COMPANIES ARE USING WEB HOSTING CLOUD HOSTING EITHER AMAZON WEB SERVICES GOOGLE. GOOGLE CLOUD OR EVEN SQUARE SPACE OR OR WORDPRESS OR SOME SUCH THING AND OFTENTIMES ALL OF THESE COMPANIES ALSO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH ANALYTICS COMPANIES. THIRD PARTY DATA BROKERS SO IT'S NOT JUST THE BIG TECH COMPANIES RIGHT IN A STUDY THAT I DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE FOUND THAT GOOGLE WAS PRESENT ON 88% OF THE FOUR FIVE OR THOUSAND SITES WE SURVEYED. ON THE INTERNET AT THAT TIME AND THAT NUMBER IS GROUND RIGHT SO IT'S SO IT'S SO WHILE WE WE AND I HAD ACTUALLY USE THE SHINE THE LIGHT NIGHT LIGHT LAW. AND I'VE WRITTEN LETTERS TO COMPANIES AND I'D RESPONSIBILITY SUB THIS KIND OF IN THE NON DATA SPACES YOU WOULD CALL IT STILL IN THE BUSINESS OF PURCHASING DATA ABOUT THE CONSUMERS. PURCHASING MEANINGLESS USING CLOUD HOSTING USING ANALYTICS SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- OF THE COMPANIES THAT THAT ARE AFFECTED THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN FACT THE ONES THAT ARE FEEDING DATA INTO INTO THE SPEAKER SYSTEM I REMEMBER IN THE SAME TWO THOUSAND EIGHT STUDY WE LOOKED AT ONE OF THE BIG DATA BROKERS. AT THE TIME AND WHERE THEY WERE PURCHASING INFORMATION THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO KEPT APPEARING ON ONE OF THESE LISTS EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ON THE DO NOT CALL AND SHE WAS ON A WITNESS PROTECTION LAST. RIGHT HAND -- SEE -- SEE PO OF THE OF THE COMPANY TOLD US AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE PURCHASING DATA FROM A LOCAL PIZZA CHAIN. SO PIZZA CHAIN THAT WAS -- IS -- NATIONAL PIZZA CHAIN BUT THEY WERE GETTING THE DATA FROM THE LOCAL -- PIZZA -- KIND OF PIZZA SALES -- DELIVERY COMPANY BECAUSE THAT'S A GREAT SO I THINK I THINK. THAT IT IS A PRECISELY THE AREA WE WANT TO KIND OF MAKE SURE IS COVERED NAY SICK AGAIN FOR COMPLIANCE SINCE MANY OF THIS THAT THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO CLOUD HOSTING CLOUD SERVICES I THINK THOSE CLOUT SERVICES WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE TOOLS. PROVIDED TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE OUR FELLOW PANELISTS TO HELP COMPLY SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT BUT TECH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND WE GONNA TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENTS SO THANKS VERY MUCH. FOR BEING HERE. SO FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS PLEASE -- LOOK ALIGNED ABOUT BEHIND A MIKE AND IF I COULD ASK YOU TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO MAYBE NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME OF WHAT AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOUR POSITION IN POLICE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL TRY TO LIMIT IT TO ONE MINUTE HOW ABOUT THAT MY NAME IS I WORK CHRIS OSWALD. I REPRESENT TWO THOUSAND BUSINESSES SERVICE PROVIDERS AND NONPROFITS THEY COMPRISE THE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS. NEARLY EVERY AD YOU'LL SEE OR HEAR IS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY TO AIN ETS MEMBERS ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA ADVERTISING HELPS GENERATE. SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND HELPS PRODUCE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION JOBS. THE A IN A WE SO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING GOALS OF THE C. CPA PRIVACY IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT VALUE. THAT DESERVES MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS IN THE MARKET PLACE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THE CCPA HOWEVER WHILE WELL INTENTIONED. WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSUMERS BUSINESSES NONPROFITS AND ADVERTISERS THAT WILL INADVERTENTLY UNDERMINE RATHER THAN ENHANCE CONSUMER PRIVACY. WE OFFER TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE AND OTHERS -- TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. BUT RATHER INSURERS IT BUT IT BUT PROMOTES THEM AND CHORES CLEAR RULES FOR BUSINESSES. SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOLLOWING FOR INITIAL ISSUES BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR OUR MEMBERS NUMBER ONE THE CCPA FORCES BUSINESSES. TO TURN PSEUDONYMOUS DATA INTO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE CONSUMER RIGHTS. THIS UNDERMINES CONSUMER PRIVACY NUMBER TWO THE CCPA FACILITATES UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONSUMER DATA BECAUSE IT TREATS HOUSEHOLDS AS A SPECIFIC CONSUMER PROVIDING ACCESS. TO ON AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS. NUMBER. THREE THE ACT FAILS TO PROVIDE OTHER EFFECTIVE MEANS TO OFFER EXPLICIT NOTICE FOR THE SALE OF DATA TO A THIRD PARTY. RESTRAINING THIRD PARTY DATA MARKET THEREBY REDUCING COMPETITION IN THE MARKET PLACE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF CONSUMERS. AND FOURTH THE CCPA FORGOES CONSUMERS OPTIONS FOR NUANCED AND TAILORED DELETION AN OPT OUT CHOICES. ALL OR NOTHING OPTIONS DEPRIVE CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER AND BENEFITS DERIVED FROM THEIR DATA. I'LL BE SUBMITTING A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD WITH MORE DETAIL ON ALL OF THESE POINTS. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THE COMMITTEE AND OTHERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TAKES ARE NICE PLACE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JEFF ERA MáS BEING FROM A COMPANY CALLED ALL CLEAR OUR FOCUS IS AND EXPERTISE IS AN IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION IDENTITY REPAIR. AND DIGITAL ID'S. DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION PROVIDES BOTH A HIGH DEGREE OF PERSONAL DATA SECURITY AND INCREASED CONSUMER CONVENIENCE. IT IS PROVEN INVALUABLE FOR AMONGST OTHER THINGS VERIFYING IDENTITIES FOR BUSINESSES IS A RESPOND TO PERSONAL DATA ACCESS REQUEST UNDER THE GPR IN THE E. U.. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CLEAR A PATH SUCH THAT RESPONSIBLE THIRD PARTY DIGITAL ID COMPANIES CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CCPA HER IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS ANDREW LACK MEN I AM AN ATTORNEY -- AND ACTUALLY I RAN FOR ASSEMBLY THE SAME TIME YOU DID YOUR FIRST ELECTED ASSEMBLYMAN CHALLENGE -- HAPPY TO SEE YOU UP HERE -- A RED ISSUE -- I AM CURRENTLY TECHNOLOGY ATTORNEY IDEA WITH DATA PRIVACY ALL OF MY CLIENTS HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES -- THEY RANGE FROM CONTENT MANAGEMENT TO BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE -- AND BEFORE THIS I WORK FOR CONGRESSMAN TED LEWIS IS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR DEALING WITH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY I GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE NEED. TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN PRACTICE AND POLICY -- I I REALLY APPRECIATE CCPA TO SOME WONDERFUL THINGS -- AND IT IS BY FAR -- I THINK IMPROVE AND BILLS IN A COUPLE AREAS SUCH AS DATA SALES WHICH IMPORTANT. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR CLIENT DOES NOT SELL DATA. NOT OF MY CLIENT I HAVE TO CLIENTS THAT SELL DATA THE REST DON'T GET THEY ALL HAVE TO PUT PLEASE DON'T IF THEY COULD FALL UNDER THIS THEY HAVE TO PUT PLEASE DON'T SELL MY DATE AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY SCREEN. IT REALLY DOESN'T -- DOES NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE -- SECONDLY -- WITH RESPECT TO COLLECTING PERSONAL DATA AND DISCLOSE IT DISCLOSING IT UNDER GPR BELIEVE ARTICLE FOURTEEN ARTICLE THIRTEEN IF YOU COLLECT DATA FROM THIRD SOURCES YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHAT THE SOURCES ARE. THIS IS A WAY TO RESOLVE THAT SITUATION TELL THE CONSUMER WHERE THEY CAN GO TO PULL OUT THEIR INFORMATION AND THAT WAY YOU CAN RESOLVE THAT. ANOTHER WAY OF DEALING WITH THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL DATA THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AND THIS IS A G. P. R. FUNCTION WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER WAS DATA MINIMIZATION. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH GT PR. I DON'T HAVE -- TO I I DON'T HAVE I CAN DE IDENTIFIED DATA I CAN SEGREGATE IT BUT I HAVE TO SHOW THAT I AM DOING IT. THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PROVIDE ALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER MAYBE YOU WAY IN ORDER TO RESOLVE AND CREATE A PAPER TRAIL TO SHOW THEIR COMPLYING. WITH RESPECTING PRIVACY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH RIDICULOUS GYRATIONS AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO BRING UP AND I JUST. A TINY UP BROUGHT IT UP BROADLY BUT I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS. THERE IS A LETTER GOING AROUND I'LL BE GLAD TO WHICH WAS EXAMPLE OF THE NIGHTMARE LETTER THAT COULD BE SENT UNDER GPR. IT WAS MEANT AS AN EXAMPLE BUT I ACTUALLY HAD CLIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED IT AS A CUT AND PASTE THAT MODEL AND THEY HAVE BASICALLY SAID IN THIS LETTER. TELL ME EVERYONE OF YOUR DATA BREACHES TELL ME HOW YOU PROTECT MY DATA TELL ME WHAT DO YOU COLLECT HOW SPECIFICALLY YOU INTEND TO GET RID OF IT. AND WHILE THAT IT BE BRIEF AND CONCISE -- BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN ABUSE THAT CAN EXIST IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SOME SORT OF LEVEL OF AUTHENTICATION AND YOU HAVE THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT I DO THINK THAT WITH RESPECT TO THIS KINDS OF ISSUES -- THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A A FURTHER EXPANSION RIGHT NOW THERE ARE CERTAIN EITHER THROUGH SAFE HARBORS A CERTIFICATIONS LIKE -- WHAT EXISTS WITH PRIVACY SHIELD IS ONE WAY TO PROTECT COMPANIES TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COMPLY? ANOTHER WAY OF DEALING WITH IT -- THERE ARE CURRENTLY COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT IF YOU WANT TO LET'S SAY GET A CREDIT REPORT DO YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF THAT THEY COLLECT. THE COMPANY IN QUESTION DOESN'T COLLECT IT BUT IT ICE PROVED THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE THERE CERTAINLY SHOULD BE A TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION. THAT WILL LEAVE ENABLE -- COMPANIES TO DEAL WITH THE EDUCATION IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE ONE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR GREAT WORK IN SITTING THROUGH -- THIS VERY LONG DISCUSSION FROM A BUNCH OF US A JOKE WILL NEED A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM TO GET THROUGH ALL OF THIS DEALING WITH PRIVACY BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER TODAY AND AND THE PANELISTS FOR DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE NEXT PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS MARK WILLIAMS AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS -- AS STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION HAS ONE CONCERN WITH THE LEGISLATION. AND WE HAVE A STRAIGHT. SOLUTION TO IT -- CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER AND SO PEOPLE A LIST OF PEOPLE IN AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND HAS BENEFITTED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH SO MANY STATES ADOPT IN IT. THOSE PROTECTIONS AND EXISTING WEB OF REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL MANDATES REGARDING OF RECORD RETENTION FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES HAS RESULTED AND A VERY WELL ORGANIZED -- AND DETAILED STATUTORY STRUCTURE. WHAT WERE WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT CCPA HAS BLURRY BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ITS STATUTORY MANDATES AN EXISTING STATUTORY MANDATES UNDER AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND SO PEOPLE WE THINK THE ENTER SACKED? WE THINK THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO CONFUSION AND IT MAY END UP WATERING DOWN AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND SO PEOPLE IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. WHICH WOULD BE IRONIC BECAUSE WE WORLD OF STUDENT RECORDS IN MY VIEW SUBPOENA AND AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR HAS SUPERIOR PROTECTIONS TO THE CCPA ON THE SAME SUBJECTS. WE THINK THAT THESE OVERLAPS. AND CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH SIMPLE EDITING INDICATING THAT RECORDS WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICT CONTROL WILL BE REGULATED BY FOR THE AND THE EXISTING -- STATUTORY STRUCTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE OF LAST YEAR THE CCPA THE LEGISLATURE VERY THOUGHTFUL. IN EXEMPTING NON PROFITS FROM THE LAW HOWEVER NONPROFITS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WE DO NOT OPERATE IN A VACUUM WE HAVE TO USE DATA DATA IS IMPORTANT FROM. EVERYTHING T CONNECTING WITH POTENTIAL DONORS TO FOR FILLING OUR PROGRAMMATIC MISSIONS. IF DATA BECOMES TOO EXPENSIVE TOO DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THERE ARE REAL AND TRUE CONSEQUENCES AND THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE BELIEVES. THAT IN FACT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN WE DO NOT HAVE A CUSHION THAT WE ARE REALLY THE CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE WILL BE THE FIRST ONES TO FEEL THE IMPACT. OF THE COST PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CCPA IF IT REMAINS. NOT CLEANED UP NOT NARROWED NOT CLARIFIED -- WE LOOK AT AREAS THAT -- PUT A LOT OF COST PRESSURES ON THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED. BY IMPLEMENTING THE CCPA -- THINGS FOR EXAMPLE TIONS BROAD CATEGORIES IF WE CAN NARROW IT AND CLARIFY IT WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MITIGATING SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES. WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE IRONIC IN AN INTENTIONAL -- ANTI PRIVACY ELEMENTS TO THE C. CPA -- PRIVACY PROTECTION IS PARAMOUNT CONCERNED TO CHARITIES WE ARE VERY GOOD STEWARDS OF PERSONAL DATA WE ASK YOU TO PLEASE LOOK AT THE HOUSEHOLD ISSUE AND THE ELEMENTS -- THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE THREAT OF OF FRAUD AS AREAS THAT WE HOPE TO BE CLEAN AT TO BE CLEANED UP AND WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU. TO KEEP THE MISSION AND THE GOALS OF THE CCPA INTACT WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT BUT WE'D LIKE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT. LOOKS AT THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SPECIFICALLY TO NONPROFITS AS WE DO THIS WORK THANK YOU. THANKS MUCH AND EXPENSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BETTER BECOME AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM WHOSE MEMBERS PROVIDE PAYROLL PROCESSING AND RELATED SERVICES TO NEARLY TWO MILLION U. S. EMPLOYERS. HISTORY HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE BROAD DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL PARTICULARLY -- WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER THAT WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFICATION COULD BE INTERPRETED TO APPLY THE EMPLOYMENT. INFORMATION THIS GOOD A PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES AND LEAD TO INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN PAYROLL RECORDS AND PERSONNEL FILES AND TO SHARE INFORMATION FOR TAX WITHHOLDING ANOTHER REQUIRED PURPOSES. WITHOUT CLARIFICATION THE PEOPLE INDUSTRY IS CONCERNED THAT LIST COULD LEAD TO CONFUSION AND SITUATIONS IN WHICH EMPLOYEES OR EVEN MEMBERS OF THEIR HOUSEHOLDS ARE REQUESTING TO DELETE EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION INCLUDING INVESTIGATION RECORDS.

THE REVENUE STREAMS FROM -- THE ADVERTISING OPERATIONS. THAT HELP TO FUND THE PROGRAMS THE JOURNALISM PROGRAMS THAT BRING VALUABLE AND INFORMATIVE -- INFORMATION TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. ARE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- THE JEOPARDIZING OF THESE REVENUE STREAM ATTENDED BY MR MAKE TAG OR OR THE PROPONENTS OF THE ACT -- AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- TO TRY TO RESOLVE THAT POTENTIAL CONCERN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF OR EXCUSE ME THE COURT APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS THAT -- DISALLOW WHOSE -- INFORMATION THAT'S OBTAIN THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORD -- AND LIMITS THAT USAGE -- WE THINK THAT IT IS -- CONSTITUTIONALLY SUSPECT IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ALSO THINK IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH LONG ESTABLISHED POLICY PRINCIPLES HERE AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF -- TO FIX THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WITH.

THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JOINT COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA'S MANY CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE -- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SMALL FOR HOLDING THESE HEARINGS -- TO LEARN MORE AND TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS -- WE DO HAVE A FEW KEY CONCERNS -- WE DO FEEL THAT CCPA COULD JUST PUSH THE IMPACT OF HONORABLE AND UNDER REPRESENTED SMALL BUSINESSES. ALSO THAT CCPA COULD IMPOSE HEAVY CASA BURDENS ON ON THE SAME SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATED. OPERATE UP NOW OPERATE UTILIZING THE INTERNET TO CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS THE CCPA WOULD MAKE CONNECTING MORE DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESS THIS PEOPLE OPT OUT. IN BUSINESSES TAKE ON NEW COMPLIANCE COST -- THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER OF LATINO CONSUMERS WHO USE THE INTERNET FOR RIGHT HERE SERVICES ENTERTAINMENT AND PURCHASING -- WE FEEL THAT CCPA COULD IMPACT THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO CONNECT -- WITH THIS GOING NOW NUMBERS IT WITHIN THE LATINO POPULATION AND FINALLY MANY LATINO BUSINESS OWNERS USE FREE OF LOW COST BUSINESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS SUCH AS EMAIL SHARE DOCUMENTS AND WEB SITES. AND THERE WAS A KEY CONCERN ARM THAT THESE FREE SERVICES COULD BE ELIMINATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NICE PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOHN CAP ATTACK ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA -- FIRST OF ALL AGAIN ECHO IN OTHERS WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SOME MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKING -- WITH REGARDS TO CONSUMER DATA PROTECTIONS APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION AND THE EFFORT HERE HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME C. P. A. IN ITS CURRENT FORM COULD HARM THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES AND IS A LOT OF BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BIG BUSINESS BUT SMALL BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW HOW THEY COMMUNICATE AND MARKET TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE -- YOU KNOW KEEP IN MIND MANY SMALL BUSINESSES SPEND A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ON FOR INTERNET ADVERTISING BECAUSE HE SIMPLY UNLIKE A LARGER BUSINESS CAN AFFORD TV OR NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING. OTHER CONCERNS ARE HOW CONSUMERS HOW CONSUMERS CAN FIND AND WE RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THE BUSINESS IS THAT THEY WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING UNDUE BURDENS FOR CONSUMERS AND COST AS WELL. AND THEN HOW MUCH FINALLY HOW MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES SMALL BUSINESSES WILL SPEND ON REPORTING PEOPLE ARE KIND OF MANY OF YOU HERE IN YOUR DISTRICTS ABOUT THE PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS SMALL IS THAT. HOW MUCH MORE SMALL BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE BURDENED WITH THAT AND TO THAT OF TO THAT END HOW MANY SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN CALIFORNIA MIGHT GIVE A SECOND THOUGHT TO EXPANDING OR RELOCATING WITHIN CALIFORNIA DUE? TO THE COULDN'T POTENTIAL CONCERNS OF COSTS FINES AND EVEN LAWSUIT SO -- WE BELIEVE THE C. C. P. A. AS A STARTING POINT FOR DISCUSSION BUT FRANKLY IT HAS TO WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR JOB CREATORS ARE NUMBER ONE JOB CREATORS. ARE NOT ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS BY THIS LINE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT THINK. THINGS MERCHANDISE PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME'S MAUREEN MAHONEY AND I REPRESENT CONSUMER REPORTS AND WE COMMEND CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS FOR PASSING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT LAST YEAR. DEFENDING AND EXPANDING THE PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES WE WERE AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND WE'RE PLEASED TO MANY OF THE INITIATIVES PROVISIONS. WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. IS BECAUSE CONSUMERS HAVE REPEATEDLY MADE IT CLEAR THEY WANT MORE NOT PURE PRODUCTIONS -- AND CERTAINLY THIS LEGISLATION IS A STEP. STRONG ENFORCEABLE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER AND DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD AND LARGELY UNREGULATED SALE OF CONSUMER DATA ON THE OPEN MARKET. CONSUMERS DESERVE DATA MINIMIZATION STRONG CONTROLS OVER THE SHARING OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AN ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO HOLD COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. TO THAT END THERE ARE WAYS THAT THE LAW COULD BE IMPROVED TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE OF CONSUMERS. PRIVACY LEGISLATION SHOULD INCLUDE DATA MINIMIZATION MOTHER IS LIMITING THE INFORMATION THAT COMPANIES COLLECTS TO THAT WHICH IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE SERVICE. IN ADDITION STRONG ENFORCEMENT IS ESSENTIAL WERE PARTICULARLY TROUBLED BY THE LAWS RIGHT TO CARE PROVISION WHICH WOULD ALLOW A BUSINESS TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKING THE LAW. SONGS IT STOPS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF BEING CAUGHT. THE BILLS WE CAN FOR SPENT MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IMPROVED BEFORE IT GOES INTO EFFECT IN. TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE MORAL LAWMAKERS SHOULD RESIST EFFORTS TO WATER DOWN OR WE CAN ALONG. FOR EXAMPLE WE STRONGLY OPPOSE EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE DEVICE DATA EXAM TARGETED ADVERTISING WE CAN THE RIGHT TO ACCESS AND PORTABILITY PROVISIONS AND ELIMINATE IMPORTANT. PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS PARTICIPATING IN LOYALTY PROGRAMS. THIS IS SENSIBLE LEGISLATION THAT WILL GIVE CONSUMERS NEED A PROTECTIONS IT WILL NOT AFFECT EXISTING PROFIT MODEL FOR ONLINE BUSINESSES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALLIED GROUPS AND STATE LAWMAKERS TO ENACT MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS TO CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK THANKS SO MUCH.
