WE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO

YEARS THAT YOU SERVE ON THIS

THINK WE GO TO COLLEGE- TO

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.528

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:26.229
CERTAINLY WHAT FACES ALL OF US

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:27.531
AT EVERY LEVEL OF OUR SOCIETY

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:29.633
NOW. THOSE SHARE SOME THOUGHTS

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.968
ON THAT WITH ME AND OF I'M VERY

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:34.404
IMPRESSED. YEAH THERE'S A

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.939
FRAMEWORK THAT I'VE BEEN

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:36.973
STUDYING CALL TWENTY FIRST

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.041
CENTURY. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:40.243
LEARNING SKILLS AND- YOU KNOW

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.311
IT IS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:44.648
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AND- I

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.049
THINK THE FIRST THE FIRST PART

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:48.485
IS BUILDING. TRUSTEE CAPACITY

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.986
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.255
AND THEIR AUTHORITY BECAUSE WE

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.291
TEND TO STAY OUT OF CURRICULA.

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:55.826
AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S A TEN

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:58.128
PLUS ONE ISSUE AND BUT STATE

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.764
LAW DOES GIVE. THE TRUSTEES THE

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.999
ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT-

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.502
SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING AND YOU

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:06.169
KNOW THEY'VE IT JUST SAYS NO WE

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:08.905
HAVE TO- COLLEGIATELY CONSULT

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.607
WITH OUR ACADEMIC SENATES AND

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.509
YOU KNOW. BRING THEM IN INTO

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:14.578
THE CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.113
THAT. THEY'RE THEY'RE OF ALL

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:17.581
THIS SO I THINK THAT FIRST PART

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:18.949
IS MAKING SURE THE TRUSTEES DO

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.517
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE A

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.552
ROLE. IN MAKING SURE BECAUSE

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.321
THEY ARE ELECTED TO KNOW WHAT

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:25.956
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS AND

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.491
SELL WHAT I HEAR FROM EMPLOYERS

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:29.226

YOU GUYS ARE NOT GETTING ANY

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:31.495
YOU DON'T DEVELOP CURRICULUM

FAST ENOUGH. AND YOU'RE NOT

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:35.799

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.299
FLUCTUATION IN THE ECONOMY AND

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.968
SUCH A FLUCTUATION IN THE

REALLY DOWN THAT SOMEHOW WE

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.182
READ TO DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:30.952

INVESTOR. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:02.717
BE MINDFUL OF THE SHORT TERM SO

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:04.986
THAT NEEDS TO BRING INTO A FACT

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.921
INVESTMENT VOLATILITY AND

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:09.424
LIQUIDITY NEEDS. SO THESE ARE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:12.460
THE FACTORS THAT WE BALANCE-

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.962
THAT THAT IN SETTING THE

CONTINUES TO REPORT THAT BACK

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:23.004
TO US SO. THE DANGER IS AND

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.040
TRYING TO REALLY FOLLOW SHORT

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.942

THEN MOST RAPID INCREASE. IN

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.724
THE MARKETS WHERE WE CONTINUE

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.460
TO HAVE THE VERY REAL ISSUES

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.595
THAT WE ALL FACE EVERY DAY- IS

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:48.997
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT SO IT'S

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:51.399

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.022
WAS- AN INCREASE THAT HAD TO

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:16.057
BE. CONNECTED FOR THE
