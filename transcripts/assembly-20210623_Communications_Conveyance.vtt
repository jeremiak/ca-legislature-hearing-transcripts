AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THAT HAS NOT

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.619
BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE CPUC

HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.807

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:05.563
GOVERNMENT IS RECEIVING IN

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.798
REGARDS TO INTERNET SERVICE AND

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.200
YOU CAN SEE IT'S STARTING TO

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.100
LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE SWISS

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:12.002
CHEESE AND THE QUESTION

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:16.073
BECOMES. IN THIS PICTURE WHAT

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.209
ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.244
NOT RECEIVING SERVICES. AND

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.179
THERE AND WHY ARE THEY NOT

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:24.815
RECEIVING THE SERVICES. WHAT

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:26.116
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS MORE

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:29.119
GRANULAR INFORMATION IN THIS.

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:31.088
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:33.991
TELL US WHO GET AND BY

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.359
HOUSEHOLD WHO'S GETTING THE

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:37.428
SERVICE AND WHO ISN'T BECAUSE

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:40.664
IF IN FACT THE IMPACT OF

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.799
PROVIDING THE SERVICE IS

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:44.301
DISCRIMINATORY AND IS LEAVING

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:46.437
OUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:48.372
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHICH IN

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.174
MANY INSTANCES MAY BE THE SAME.

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:53.444
THEN THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.079
THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN MY ****

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.513
ARE PROHIBITED FROM FROM THEIR

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.848
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT FROM DOING

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:59.283
THAT AND THE REASON THIS

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.352
BECOMES IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IF

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.554
WORD TOLD ALL THE TIME HEY LOOK

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.522
IF. WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB HOW

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.458
DOES THE C. P. U. C. DECIDE HEY

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.292
WAIT A MINUTE YOUR FRANCHISE

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.895
AGREEMENT- SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:11.528
TO BE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:14.231
IN YOUR NOT SO WHY. SO THE

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.367
OTHER THING THE BILL DOES. IS

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:21.272
IT. IT PUTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:22.873
BACK AT THE TABLE WHEN

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.942
DIFFICULT WAS INSTITUTED LOCAL

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.076
GOVERNMENT WITH CUT OUT THERE'S

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:28.178
NO PLACE IN A PROCESS FOR LOCAL

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:29.980
GOVERNMENT HOULD BE INVOLVED

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:31.548
BUT UNDER THIS BILL IT

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.584
BASICALLY SAYS WHEN THE C. P.

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:34.652
U. C. IS LOOKING AT YOUR

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:37.254
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TO SAY DO

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.823
YOU GET ANOTHER TEN YEARS. THE

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.926
CITIES. GET TO LOOK AT THE

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.295
INFORMATION. OR THE COUNTIES

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.497
AND DETERMINE PUNE. I THINK

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:47.932
THEY'RE REALLY HITTING THE

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.566
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:50.501
MONEY BUT NOT THE COMMUNITIES

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.469
THAT DON'T. AND SO THEY NEED TO

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:53.570
BE AT TE TABLE SO THERE'S A

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.072
DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER THE

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.141
DIFF COLLECTION SLICES. SHOULD

00:42:57.207 --> 00:43:00.077
BE- INCLUDE IT SHOULD SHOULD BE

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.812
RENEWED FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.014
TEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME. AND

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.951
SO IT'S THIS IS. THE PURPOSE OF

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.586
THE BILL IS BASICALLY TO CREATE

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:11.422
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:14.224
DATA TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:16.026
FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.828
WITH A SEAT AT THE TABLE

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:18.595
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHICH

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:19.964
COMMUNITIES ARE THE COMMUNITIES

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.333
ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE. ISSUES

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:27.004
WITH ACCESS- AND IT IT IT- IT

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.639
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:31.608
DIALOGUE AND A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.843
WERE WE GOING TO DEPLOY. REALLY

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.645
LIMITED STATE RESOURCES BECAUSE

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.580
THERE ARE A MY BILL DOESN'T SAY

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.082

AGO. BUT THERE ARE STATE

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.318
RESOURCES WERE I'M BETTER BEING

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.853
DEPLOYED THE ASSEMBLY HAS A

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.821
COUPLE OF GOOD BILLS THAT ARE

00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:45.422
TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT THAT

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:48.325
SERVICE FUND- WE DON'T KNOW.

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:49.393
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DEPLOY

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.227
THEM AND WHERE DO WE HAVE

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:53.097
HOLES- AND LET ME JUST SAY IN

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:55.699
ADDITION. THAT THERE ARE

ACCESS CAN BE PROVIDED THERE

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.538
ARE THINGS THAT ARE BARRIERS

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.207
RIGHT THEY BECOME VERY VERY

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.241
EXPENSIVE WE'RE NOT SAYING THEY

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.643
HAVE TO DO IT. IF IT'S VERY

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.621
FOR IS DATA IN THIS. IN THIS

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:39.889
BILL AND ONE OF THE DATA POINT

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:43.159

THE BILL. THANK YOU. AND THE

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.840
FINAL QUESTION- I DO HAVE AN

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.909
ISSUE AROUND. I UNDERSTAND WE

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.177

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.778
THIS INFORMATION SO WE HAVE.

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:05.948
MORE GRANULAR PICTURE. OF WHERE

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:09.051
VIDEO IS BEING USED OR NOT USED

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.154
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.189
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:15.091
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENT ENOUGH

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:19.595
PRIVACY CONFIDENTIALITY- TO.

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:21.797
GIVING TO SEE IF YOU SEE THAT

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.432
INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.968
NORMALLY YOU USE A RANGE OF

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.005
SPEEDS RATHER THAN A SET SPEED-

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.773
AND THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.642
THINGS VERY. AND THIS VARIAION

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.744
OF PROVISION OF SERVICE SO I

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.379
WOULD HOPE IN THE FUTURE

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.013
AMENDMENT YOU WOULD BE

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.515
CONSIDERING- THE CONFIDENTIALLY

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.584
OP THE CONFIDENTIALITY ASPECT.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.053
OF THOSE SPEEDS FOR CONSIDER A

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.189
RANGE THAT CAN BE GIVEN SO TO

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.324
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO LIABILITY

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:48.891
ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. TO THE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:52.028
CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.063
LEVEL OF DETAIL IN REGARDS TO

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.332
THE- THE RANGE OF THE SPEECH AT

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.701
THE SPEEDS- OBVIOUSLY THE SPEED

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:01.237
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IF YOU

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:05.875
ARE IN I'M ABLE TO DO- ZOOM

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.477
MEETINGS OR YOUR KIDS ARE AND

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:11.347
IF- AND UNABLE TO. ACCESS THEIR

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.149
EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.116
THEY THEY'RE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.018
THAT THE HIGH SPEEDS NECESSARY

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.987
FOR THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM SO- A

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:18.955
RANGE OF SPEECH MIGHT BE

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.123
APPROPRIATE- AND- WE'LL TAKE A

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.191
LOOK AT THAT AND I DO

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:23.092
APPRECIATE HE WHOLE ISSUE OF

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:26.229
THE- PHYSICAL BARRIERS IT'S

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.197
NEVER INTENDED TO REQUIRE. THE

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.932
COMPANIES TO HAVE TO OVERCOME

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.767
PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT CREATE

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:35.972
A- COST THAT IS- WHEN BEYOND

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.473
WHAT IS WHAT WHAT WHAT ONE

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.641
WOULD THINK IT'S REASONABLE SO

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.376
WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT IN

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.410
THERE MAYBE LANGUAGE WE CAN ADD

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.279
THAT THAT- CLARIFIES OUT A

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.015
LITTLE BIT MORE SO APPRECIATE.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:50.553

AUTHOR IN THE INTENT OF THIS

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.991
BILL AND UNDERSTANDING

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:55.891
ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIS

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.094
PANDEMIC THE NEED FOR EXPANDING

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.163
ACCESS- I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.864
YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:05.334
THAT THE BILL'S DONE RIGHT AND

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.969
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.070
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.006
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.440
ACTUALLY COLLECTS- PRETTY

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.776
DETAILED DATA I'M DOWN TO THE

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:17.446
CENSUS BLOCK AND ADDRESS SO

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.615
ISN'T THIS INFORMATION-

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.584
DUPLICATIVE IF THIS IS A C. U.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.219
P. C. IS ALREADY COLLECTING

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.087
THIS DATA OR IS THERE

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.056
ADDITIONAL DATA THAT THEY'RE

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.258
CURRENTLY NOT COLLECTING- AND

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.360
THEN MY OTHER QUESTION. IS

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.996
AROUND PREEMPTION IT'S BEEN-

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.164
BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.000
THAT THIS LAW COULD ACTUALLY-

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:40.036
IS IT'S MOST LIKELY PREEMPTED

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:43.139
BY FEDERAL LAW SO HAS

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.774
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WAITED ON

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.476
WHETHER OR NOT- THIS IS LEGAL

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.645
AND WILL IT BE CHALLENGED IN

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.413
THE FUTURE BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:53.249
DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE THIS-

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.184
LEGISLATION AT YOU HAVE AND

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.586
HAVE TO PUT RESOURCES IN- TO

01:05:57.653 --> 01:06:02.425
LEGAL- THE LEGAL. ACTION ON

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.393

VERY MUCH ON THE ISSUE PRESENT

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.368
PREEMPTION- YES LEAD COUNSEL

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.736
HAS LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY ARE

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.037
VERY CAREFULLY CRAFTED THE

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.138
LANGUAGE THAT WERE THAT WERE

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:18.040
USING- IT DOESN'T KEEP YOU FROM

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:19.608
GETTING SUED. BUT AT LEAST I

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.110
FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.079
WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO THREAD

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:26.415
A NEEDLE THAT THAT'S VERY FINE-

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.451
AND- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:32.388
DOES VERY- REGULATORY PROCESS

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:33.556
AND WE DO OURS AND THEY'RE FOR

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.691
DIFFERENT SERVICES ENTIRELY.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.526
AND SO WHAT WE FOCUSED ON THE

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:40.229
ON THE ON THE CPUC- AND THE

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:43.499
VIDEO CONFERENCING- ASPECT OF-

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:47.136
OF THE- SERVICES THAT ARE

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:51.474
PROVIDED- YOUR OTHER QUESTION-

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.209
I HAD TO DO WITH DATA SO LET ME

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.311
JUST SAY THAT- IS THAT THE FORM

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.847
IN WHICH THAT THAT THE FORM IN

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.315
WHICH THE DATA IS PROVIDED IS

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.384
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE DATA

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:03.352
THAT THE CPUC IS GETTING RIGHT

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:06.655
RIGHT NOW IS- IN A IN A FORMAT.

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.224
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.194
IS THE WHAT IS THE SERVICE AREA

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:14.797
THAT THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY IS

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.766
INTENDING TO SERVER TO SERVER

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.267

THAT THEY DECLARED AND IT IT'S

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:28.544
NOT VERY GRANULAR IT'S VERY-

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.380
BROAD AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.581
IS OKAY YOU'VE GIVEN US THE

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:35.484
SERVICE AREA. THAT YOU WANT TO

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.987
PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO BUT WE

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:38.988
DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.089
PROVIDING THE SERVICE THERE ARE

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:44.126
NOT SO SHOW US THE DATA BECAUSE

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:46.195
YOU HAVE IT AND YOU GIVE IT TO

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.764
THE FCC SHOW US THE DATA IN A

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.167
FORMAT WHERE WE CAN WE CAN DO

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.869
AN OVERLAY AND WE CAN SEE WHERE

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.971
ARE YOU ACTUALLY GIVING SERVICE

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.339
AND WHERE HAVE YOU SAID YOU

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:59.341
WANT TO BUT YOU HAVEN'T YET.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.509
AND THE REASON THAT BECOMES

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:03.412
IMPORTANT IS THAT IF YOU'VE HAD

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:05.347
THIS LICENSE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:08.918
AND- AND IF THE AREA THAT YOU

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:10.820
HAVEN'T PROVIDED SERVICE YET

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:13.689
WHY WHY IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DO

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.258
BUILD OUT THEN THAT'S THAT WILL

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.760
GIVE YOU TIME IS C. P. U. C.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.862
CAN SAY NUMBER OF THINGS BUT IF

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:25.801
THE REASON IS. IF YOU THEN DRAW

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.704
MAKE A MAP OF. THAT AREA AND

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:32.441
IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE THE AT

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.577
THE RATE OF POVERTY IS ABOVE A

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:36.679
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. AND THEY

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:40.015
OVERLAP COMPLETELY THEN WE GOT

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.984
A PROBLEM THAT'S THE REASON FOR

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.552
THE GRANULARITY OF THE

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:46.388
INFORMATION THEY PRODUCE IT FOR

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.724
THE FCC THEY WE JUST ASKING

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:49.625
THAT WE GET THE SAME KIND OF

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:52.461
INFORMATION FOR THE PUC

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:53.028
BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES THAT

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.263
GRANT THE LICENSE. AND THE

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:59.001
LICENSE REVIEW BECOMES

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.203
MEANINGLESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.638
AN ABOUT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.206
TO EVEN YOU KNOW MAKE IT IS A

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.908
DETERMINATION OF HOW WELL

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.543
THEY'VE DONE THEIR BUILD UP.

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:12.181
FOLLOW UP CARE. YEAH SO AND- IF

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.148
THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR THE

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:15.017
OPPOSITION- CAN THE OPPOSITION

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:19.522
SPEAK TO THE CURRENT- DATA THAT

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.056
THE C. U. P. C. COLLECTS

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:22.091
BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.893
THAT IT GETS A VERY GRANULAR IT

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.895
GETS DOWN TO THE CENSUS BLOCK

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.931
AN ADDRESS- AND I'M WONDERING

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.933
IF THE OPPOSITION CAN WEIGH ON

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.368
AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.370
AND WHAT CURRENTLY THE C. P. C.

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:36.272
U. P. C. COULD PROVIDE. AND

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:40.142
HOPE THE MISS MCINTYRE STILL ON

PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:56.792
INFORMATION BASED ON DEFENSIVE

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.460
BLOCKS THAT WE INTEND TO

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.095

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.864
INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED BY

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.866
THE BILL IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.301
MORE GRANULAR THAN WE ARE

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.369
REQUIRED TO REPORT. TO THE

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:09.872
COMMISSION OR TO THE FCC AND

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:12.374
THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC RATE

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:13.776
INFORMATION BUSINESS

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:16.579
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. AND IT

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.714
IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IF

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:21.750
SINGLED OUT ONE INDUSTRY AND

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.586
REQUIRES US TO REPORT.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:24.653
SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.155
INFORMATION NOT CURRENTLY

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:28.490
REQUIRED ELSEWHERE AND DOES

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.660
NOTHING TO ENHANCE BROADBAND

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.629
MAPPING. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:36.465
QUESTIONS. I WOULD HAVE MISSED

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:40.369
DAVIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:40.903
SENATOR AND I DON'T THINK

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.938
THERE'S ANY- QUESTION THAT

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.406
BROADBAND IS PROBABLY ONE OF

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:46.108
THE MOST BIGGEST PRIORITIES WE

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.645
HAVE COMING UP I DO HAVE- A

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.412
COMMON IN A QUESTION THROUGH

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.748
THE CHAIR OF COURSE- RIGHT NOW

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.116
WHEN THE BIGGEST WE COULD SAY

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.985
BARRIERS- CONCERNS ON IS THE

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:58.587
DELAY WITH TRYING TO GET THESE

01:10:58.654 --> 01:10:59.288
PERMITS THROUGH THE LOCAL

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.991
GOVERNMENT. AND SO MY QUESTION

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.626
IS THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:04.727
BILL REQUIRES THAT THE C. P. U.

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:08.197
C. TO ACCESS DIFFICULT- TO

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:09.431
BUILD OUT BUT IT REMOVES THE

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.866
CURRENT LAW THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:11.800
NOW THAT ALLOWS US

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.902
CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS-

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:16.005
DISASTERS INCLUDING ILDFIRES

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.040
OR AGAIN- DELAYS ON GETTING

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:21.043
PERMITS SO MY QUESTION IS- WHY

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.612
REMOVED- I THINK IT WAS SECTION

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.947
FIVE EIGHT NINE O. F. OF WITH

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.048
THE CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW AND

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.616
WOULD YOU BE IN CONSIDERATION

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:28.684
OF PUTTING THIS BACK SO THAT WE

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.985
COULD ACTUALLY MOVE THIS

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.453
FORWARD. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.122
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DELAYED

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:37.059
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERMITS

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.293
THANK YOU. FOR THE CARE. THANK

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.094

THAT QUESTION- I WILL I'LL TAKE

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.600
A LOOK AT IT I DON'T. RECALL I

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.568
DON'T REMEMBER ANY AMENDMENT

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:47.703
THAT WOULD ACT IN THE WAY THAT

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.138
YOU SUGGESTED BUT WE'LL TAKE A

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:50.072
LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THAT

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.874
SECTION. AND IF IT'S BEEN DONE

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.409
IN ERROR WILL WILL FIX IT

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.177
OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY I THERE'S NO

01:11:55.244 --> 01:12:00.049
INTENT. TO STOP. THE

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:00.649
EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE PART OF

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.851
DIFFICULT. THERE WERE SOME THAT

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.454
WERE WRITTEN IN SPECIFICALLY TO

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.790

STOPPING THAT. PRITCHETT YEAH

THAT EITHER BUT THEY HAVE TO

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.000
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT BECAUSE

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:18.801

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.851
BILL IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:46.021

FRANCHISING AUTHORITIES FROM

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.467
HAS BEEN MENTIONED A LEGAL

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.102
OPINION FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.056
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.525
INTERACTION. NOT WITH THE

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.561
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE

WELL. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.176
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DIRECTLY

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.779
OR INDIRECTLY REQUIRING A CABLE

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.348

C. AND C. AS WELL THIS IS A

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:20.082
SPACE THAT I HAVE CONTINUED. TO

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:23.118
ASK THE QUESTION WHAT IS TAKING

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.787
US SO LONG TO FINISH IT. BUT

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:30.158
THERE IS NO PUBLIC GOOD. IN A

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:33.428
BILL THAT ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT.

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:36.265
IF IT INVITES LITIGATION. THIS

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.499
BILL DOES INVITE THAT

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.269
LITIGATION SO I'M GOING TO

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:43.105
RESERVE MY VOTE ON THIS BILL

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.474
UNTIL THE FORMAL LEGISLATIVE

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.309
COUNSEL'S OPINION IN WRITING IS

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.878
PRODUCED. AND ALL RESERVE MY

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.214
VOTE FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.416
CONSIDERING OTHER LEGISLATIVE

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:57.185
COUNCIL SO. THAT OPINION ON

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.721
THIS WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:03.325
BELIEVE BASED ON MY CONTACTS

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.194
WITH THE INDEPENDENT- LAWYERS

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.330
YEAH- IN SPACE THIS SPACE THAT

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.933
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.968
THAT THIS IS PREEMPTIVE. SO THE

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.970
GOOD THAT WE TRY TO DO HERE MAY

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.239
VERY WELL BE OFFSET BY A

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.474
LITIGATION THAT IS EXPENSIVE.

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.744
TIME CONSUMING AND UP. MIGHT

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.812
HOLD UP THE EFFORTS WE'RE

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:26.515
TRYING TO DO HERE. SO I'M GOING

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:29.584
TO LAY OFF THE BILL. WHEN THE-

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.687
LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS OFFICE

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.922
PRESENTS ME WITH THE- FORMAL

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.591
WRITTEN OPINION IT IS CERTAINLY

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:40.262
GOING TO BE- HAD EVERYBODY ELSE

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.965
AND IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT THE-

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:45.267
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL- WE'LL OR

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:49.104
HAS. NOTIFIED YOUR OFFICE OF

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.306
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE IN THE

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:53.508
MIDST OF CREATING AN OPINION I

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.210
DO BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:59.514
SLOW DOWN A BIT. TAKE A LOOK AT

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.650
WHAT WE HAVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.652
LAWYERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:07.289
THIS IS. A PRODUCTION ISSUE IF

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.524
WE GET A CONCURRING OPINION

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.560
FROM BUDGET COUNCIL I THINK

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:13.528
THAT OUGHT TO INSTRUCT. THE

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.530
BILL AND HOW IT MAY BE AMENDED

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:20.569
GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. YEAH

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.603
THANK YOU IN AND THIS IS WHY

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.071
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:24.106
IS BECAUSE PEOPLE CONTENT

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:25.207
EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:27.509
OPINION AND BUT WHAT THEY THINK

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:30.445
IS THE BEST A RESULT I DO WANT

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.113
TO DRESS AND JUST REITERATE

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.215
THAT WE DID LOOK INTO THE

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.950
ISSUE- PREEMPTION IN WHAT WE

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:37.185
BELIEVE WE'VE- ROAD IN THE BILL

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:38.987
AS AMENDMENTS AT THE AUTHOR

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:41.289
TOOK ADDRESS THAT AND WE DID

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:42.758
WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.459
NOW AND I HAVEN'T SAID THAT

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.694
BROADBAND IS YOU KNOW IS

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:48.330
REGULATED- AND PREEMPTED BUT

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:51.600
THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY- THIS

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:54.002
BILL WILL WOULD ADDRESS THE

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.104
ISSUES OF VIDEO AND CABLE-

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:59.241
WHICH ARE SEPARATE. FROM

01:17:59.307 --> 01:17:59.975
BROADBAND THAT THEN. AND I

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.510
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.912
THAT GRANULAR DATA WHICH IS FAR

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.080
AND ABOVE WHAT THE CENSUS BLOCK

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.348
DATA HASN'T AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:10.352
DEMONSTRATED BY. BY THE GRAPHIC

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.854
FOR OR MAP BY LAW BY LACK FOR

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.723
LACK OF BETTER WORDS- BUT ALSO

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.757
A REMINDER COLLEAGUES TO THAT

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:17.059
THIS IS WHY THE STATE

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.094
LEGISLATURE TO EXIST. TO CREATE

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.296
LAWS THAT ARE. THAT INVENTED

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.999
THAT ARE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.268
WE JUST MEANT FOR YEARS- GOING

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.302
IN ONE DIRECTION WITH LAWS THAT

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.171
WE BELIEVE. I WAS EMPLOYED FOR

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.006
THE PURPOSE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:31.540
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.041
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:36.244
AND SOYOU GOT WE CAN CREATE

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:38.113
LONGER UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT FOR

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.182
CALIFORNIA. AT OR WHY WOULD WE

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:42.717
HAVE LEGISLATURE- BUT HAVING

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:44.786
SAID THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.388
THE AMENDMENT STRUCK HERE.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.991
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES- AND I'M

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.626
HAVING SAID THAT I WANT TO ST-

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:55.730
THE ARCHER MAGNERS FONG. SURE

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:59.234
THE TICKET PLEASE MATT. MY

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.903
REQUEST IS AN OFFICIAL INFORM A

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:06.608
FORMALIZED SPECIFIED REQUEST.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:11.213
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BILL AS

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.615
PART OF THAT THEY WILL BE

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:16.051
LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS. AND

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:19.588
IF IN FACT WHAT IS CLAIMED HERE

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:22.524
IS FOUND TO BE SUPPORTIVE. IN

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.161
THAT OPINION. I SEE TO THAT

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.864
POINT BUT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.900
AMBIGUITY AND UNCERTAINTY. I

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.935
HEAR THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:36.338
RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:37.606
SOMETHING THAT IS LITIGATED.

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:41.176
AND THAT. YOU SAY THE

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.078
LEGISLATURE EXISTS WELL

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:47.549
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. EXISTS AND

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.453
SO THIS IS A FORMAL BROAD.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:57.692
SPECIFIED REQUEST AND THEY ARE

01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:59.060
WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW AND I

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:02.697
TRUST THAT THEY WILL BE FAIR-

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:05.133
AND- GIVE US THAT AS A GOOD

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.970
OPINION- THE QUESTION IS THEN.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:12.340
DOES ALLEGE COUNCIL- HALF OF

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:15.210
THOSE PREEMPTION CONCERNS AS DO

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:15.810
THE PRIVATE LAWYERS AND I'VE

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:20.282
CONSULTED N. AS THE LAWYERS

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.150
FOR- SOME OF THE OPPONENTS.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.719
HAVE DEMONSTRATED- AND SO

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:27.756
THAT'S WHY I AM LAYING OFF. I

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.090
WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.393
A PLACE WHERE. WE CAN DO THE

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:32.861
KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE AUTHOR

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:35.697
SEEKS TO DO WITHOUT THE RISK OF

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.899
LONG PROTRACTED LITIGATION AND

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:40.335
I THINK WE INVITE THAT. IF

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:43.071
WE'RE NOT VERY VERY CAREFUL. N.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.172
AND I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.240
AND THEN JUST GO TAKE A PER

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:46.174
POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.543
DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH IT'S

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.345
NOT CUSTOMARY TO DO THAT- BUT-

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:51.580
AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.847
IN GOOD SPIRIT TO DO SO. I'M

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:54.216
OKAY WITH THAT. FIRST I

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:55.317
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.852
APPRECIATE- BEING ABLE TO. TAKE

01:20:57.919 --> 01:20:59.854
A LOOK AT- WHATEVER RESULT

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:02.090
MAKEUP. BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE AT

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.793
THE END OF THE DAY THAT WE- WE

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.494
GO TO LET'S COUNCIL- FOR PEOPLE.

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.263
AND WE ALL TEND TO AGREE THAT

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:09.464
ONCE THEY MADE AN OPINION WELL

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:12.267
WE AGREE OR DISAGREE ACOSTA-

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:14.236
BUT KNOWING MY COMMENT IS THAT-

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:18.907
I WAS LOOKING TOWARDS- THIS-

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:22.110
TOWARDS- TOWARDS YOUR REQUEST

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.578
OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WHAT I

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.947
WAS AYING. WAS THAT WHEN WE

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.782
WERE CRAFTING THE AMENDMENTS WE

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.584
ALSO- ASK LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.885
WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT THAN

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:31.953
A DOZEN OPINIONS LEGISLATIVE

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.923
pRESULT OF THE THURMOND. SENDING

IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT BUT-

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:39.861
IN MY COMMENT ABOUT LET'S MAKE

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.330
LAWS WE DO MAKE LAWS YOU KNOW

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.231

DIFFERENT ITEMS AND THAT'S WHAT

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.522
MY COMMENTS WERE MADE TO BE SO

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:08.857
THAT I AT LEAST ADDRESS THAT
