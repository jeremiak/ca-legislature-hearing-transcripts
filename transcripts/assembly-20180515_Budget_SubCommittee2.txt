GOOD MORNING WILL BEGIN THAT SIMPLY BUDGET. SUB COMMANDER TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY DISGUSTINGLY PROP NINETY EIGHT DEPARTMENT EDUCATION THE GOVERNOR'S. MAY REVISED BUDGET PROPOSALS. WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE. AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROP NINETY EIGHT. K. TWELVE AN EARLY EDUCATION PLAN I DON'T KNOW. NNOVA. START WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MORNINGSTAR ABOUT AND YOU'RE RECEIVING A HAND. THE. SO I THE HAND THAT YOU'LL BE RECEIVING A COVERS THE. CHANGES THE AND THE GOVERNORS THAT THE PROPOSAL SINCE JANUARY OF THE MAY REVISION FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. SO I'M IN FIGURE ONE ON ONE SIDE OF YOUR SHEET AS ALL OF THE CHANGES FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN THE THREE FISCAL YEARS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SO RELATIVE OUT TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUT A. BUDGET REVENUE INCREASES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT INCREASE IN REVENUES BEEN SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO AS WE DISCUSSED ON AT A PREVIOUS HEARING IN THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN REVENUE DID NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE. TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEE. THE PRIMARY REASON THERE SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVED BUT THE PRIMARY REASON IS THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS A TEST TO YEAR. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TURNS PROTESTS THREE YEAR TO ATTEST TO YEAR WITH THE MAY REVISION FACTORS. AND UNDER ATTEST TO YEAR. THE GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE IS DRIVEN BY PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME AND THAT DOESN'T ADJUST WITH CHANGES IN STATE REVENUE. SO THE ONLY ADDITIONAL AYE INCREASE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A TEST TO YEAR AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN REVENUE. IS FROM THE MAINTENANCE FACTOR PAYMENT AND GENERALLY IF REVENUES GO UP THERE'S USUALLY A LARGER MAINTENANCE FACTOR PAYMENT THAT WOULD BE MADE ON TOP OF IT HAS TO. HOWEVER IN A THIS FORECAST WERE COMPLETELY PAIN THE MAINTENANCE FACTOR BALANCE OFF IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. SO ANY INCREASES IN REVENUE AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL NO LONGER RESULT IN AN INCREASE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE REASONING BEHIND THAT. SO FOR US SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE MEN ON GUARANTEE IS GOING UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. ON AND SIT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE PERIOD SO THAT'S A TOTAL OF THREE YEAR PERIOD OF SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO ADDITIONALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATION OF DONNA ISN'T AND THAT'S PROPOSAL IS WE'VE ALSO REVENGE THE GUARANTEE. TO INCLUDE A CHILD CARE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT WERE ADDED TO THE GUARANTEE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OUT IN THE AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE. POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO PART OF THE INCREASE YOUR SCENE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION A LARGE PORTION OF IT IS ACTUALLY FROM THE RETENTION AND NOT NECESSARILY THE CHANGES IN THE FACTORS. SO WHILE IT DOES SEEM THAT THE FORECAST IS. NOT WHAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO IN TOTAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY YEAR OVER YEAR OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WHICH AND SAT. SEVENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S A NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OVER THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD SO THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE. JUST NOT WITH THE NEW REVENUES. SO IN FIGURE TWO. IT IS A LIST OF ALL THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT. ARE NEW AND THEN OF SOME THAT EXIST IN SUCH AS YOU BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND MAY REVISION SO IN TOTAL WITH THE CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE. A SUBTLE AT PAYMENTS AND OTHER ONE TIME SAVINGS AVAILABLE WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES PUTTING THE TOTAL FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. AT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION. SO BEFORE. I MOVE ON TO THE SPENDING PLAN THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE I'D LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. UP FOR CERTIFYING THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AS OUTLINED IN A YOUR FIGURE THREE ON THIS PAGE. AT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A NEW CERTIFICATION PROCESS. IT'S PROCESS WOULD BE DONE ANNUALLY. IT WILL PROVIDE CERTAINTY AROUND FUTURE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AROUND THIS WHOLE PROCESS. IT WOULD ALSO HELP LIKE RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AND THAT KINDA GET STRUNG OUT THROUGH THE YEARS BECAUSE WE BE ABLE TO ADDRESS INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCES IN AND DIFFERENT VALUES IMMEDIATELY. THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD BEGAN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WOULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO CERTIFY IN YEARS FIVE STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN. SO UNDER CURRENT LAW THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE I SHOULD BE CERTIFIED NINE MONTHS OUT OF AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SO THE TIMELINE THAT SIN LA RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE SOME OF THE FACTORS ARE ACTUALLY NOT FINAL. UNTIL IT WOULD BE THIS MAY REVISION PROCESS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN OVER THOUGH. SEVERAL YEARS SOME INTERPRETATION LIKE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER DIFFERENCES AND HOW THE LAWS INTERPRETED SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE NOT SERVED BY THE GUARANTEE SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE. SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON RETIRING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES AND THEN JUST THROWING UP ANY OBLIGATION IT'S OH TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WE MOVE. TOWARD A NEW ADMINISTRATION COMING IN. SO UNDER THIS NEW PROCESS I EACH YEAR AT THIS TIME BID FINANCE WOULD PUBLISH A CERTIFICATION VALUE FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR SO IF WE WERE DOING THIS CURRENTLY THE FISCAL YEAR WE WOULD BE CERTIFYING RIGHT NOW WOULD BE THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AMOUNT. THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE POSTED I'M AND PUBLISHED. AND THEN. AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS AND RESPONSES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. IT WOULD INVOLVE OF THAT THE PART OF THE. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE. S. P. AYE THIS SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. BLINK DOT NOT. AND THEY WOULD PROVIDE THE DATA CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY ALREADY PROVIDE US WITH FOR THIS THEY WOULD GIVE US THEIR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE THE F. T.*. ALSO ANY ALLOCATIONS AND APPROPRIATIONS AND THEN PROPERTY TAXES AND THEN FINANCE WOULD USE ALL OF THEIR UPDATED FACTORS THAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN MAY REVISION. TO CALCULATE THE FINAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE FOR CERTIFICATION PURPOSES ONCE THAT'S POSTED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND WE HAVE FUN. A CHANCE TO RECEIVE RESPONSES AND COMMENTS BACK THEN. A JUNE THIRTIETH THE FINAL CERTIFICATION AMOUNT WOULD BE POSTED AND THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE RESPONSES ALL OF THE INPUT AND COMMENTS THAT RECEIVED WITH RESPONSES AND ANSWERS TO ANY QUESTIONS. SO AFTER. JUNE THIRTIETH THERE WOULD BE A NINETY DAY PERIOD KINDA WAITING PERIOD SOTHAT ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO FILE A LEGAL CHALLENGE COULD DO SO. AND IT THE IN ABOUT THIRTY DAYS IF NO LEGAL CHALLENGE HAS BEEN FILED THEN THE CERTIFICATION WOULD BE FINALIZED I'M AT THAT POINT IN TIME ANY SETTLE UP OWED. OR ADJUSTMENTS WOULD BE MADE. GOING FORWARD. SO ALSO IS PART OF THIS UP PROPOSAL THERE IS THE. CREATION OF A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ALLOCATION SCHEDULE. THIS MECCA THIS MECHANISM ALLOWS FOR ADDED BUDGET FLEXIBILITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE OF IN THE STATE AND ALSO SORT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATION THAT COUNT TOWARDS MEETING THE MOMENT GUARANTEE. WITHOUT ACTUALLY REDUCING APPROPRIATIONS ONGOING OR ONGOING ALLOCATIONS TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE IF WE WOULD BE FINALIZING THE PRIOR YEAR RIGHT NOW AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. WHICH TO MANY APPROPRIATIONS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS I COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THAT FISCAL YEAR WERE CERTIFYING THAN THAT AMOUNT OVER THAT EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULD ACTUALLY BE CREDITED TO THIS COST ALLOCATION ACCOUNT. AND HAT CREDIT WOULD BE USED IN FUTURE TIMES WHEN WE OWE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUBTLE UP OR WE OWE THEM ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION. SO IN YEARS THAT WE DID ARE CERTIFIED THE GUARANTEE. AND IT'S DETERMINED THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATED THEN AFTER THE FINAL CERTIFICATION THE CONTROLLER WORD AUTOMATICALLY APPROPRIATE. THOUGHT SATELLITE BALANCE. FIRST THOUGH THEY WOULD PLAY ANY CREDIT IN THIS A COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULED TO FIX EXTENT THAT IT COVERS THAT IN ANYTHING THAT IT DOESN'T COVER WOULD BE APPROPRIATED. IF THE STATE COULDN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THE FULL PAYMENT THAT POINT IN TIME. THAN A MULTI YEAR PAYMENT AGREEMENT WOULD BE OUT IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THE CONTROLLER WOULD APPROPRIATE TOWARD THAT SCHEDULE SO PROVIDES MORE CERTAINTY AND MANY SATELLITE PAYMENTS. IN SOME OF OUR SETTLED POUNCES RIGHT NOW DATE BACK TO NINE TEN. THERE IS A CAP. ON THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE OF ONE PERCENT SO THIS DOES PUT WHAT GOD DOES LIMIT THE FLEXIBILITY OF THIS COST ALLOCATION BUT IT ALSO. ALLOWS IT TO NOT GROW AS LARGE. OR TWO LARGE THAT IT'S BECOMES UNWIELDY. SO ALSO AS PART OF THE. ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA I'M CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. RIGHT NOW IN CURRENT LAW LCF FAST THE BASIS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED HOWEVER THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IS PROVIDED IS DISCRETIONARY. SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IT WOULDN'T IT WOULD MIMIC THE REVENUE LIMITS OF THE PAST AND PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M. AND AND CHARTER SCHOOLS ADDITIONAL. ASSURANCES THAT CALL IT WOULD BE PROVIDED. SO AND FINALLY I MIGHT MENTION IT EARLIER BUT IT IS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE RETENTION OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE TO INCLUDE THE CHARA THAT CHILD CARE. WRAPAROUND THAT. IS AT THE BACK TO FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. THE WITHOUT AM I'LL GO DOWN INTO THE CAGE IS THE CAPABLE PORTION OF THE SPENDING PLAN THAT'S CHANGED ITS ON THE BACKSIDE OF YOUR SHEET AND FIGURE FOR. SO CONSISTENT WITH PAST PROPOSALS THE MAY REVISION CONTINUES TO FOCUS THE MAJORITY OF THE SPENDING ON ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY PAYMENTS AND FOR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE THESE TYPES OF PAYMENTS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES. ON THE ONE TIME CHARGE OF THE VERY TOP THAT. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT THAT'S GOING TOWARDS THIS DISCRETIONARY PAYMENTS OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS. BRINGING THE TOTAL PAYMENT TO TWO BILLION. OVER THE PAST FOUR FIVE YEARS IF YOU INCLUDE THIS PAYMENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE RECEIVED SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY PAYMENTS. ANOTHER. NOTABLE CHANGE TO A A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION GRANT PROGRAM ORIGINALLY AT THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL HAD FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TEN THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THAT FUNDING IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE SO THIS IS A BACK PHILIP. GENERAL FUND. WITH REGARDS TO NEW PROPOSALS THERE'S A TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO CONVERT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY ASSESSMENT. EXAM TO A COMPUTER BASED MODEL THIS AND ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TEST FOR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. THERE'S A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SB SEVEN FORTY CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. THIS IS TO FULFILL THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SHORTFALL ARM IN ORDER TO ALIGN FUNDING WITH PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IF YOU RECALL THERE IS AN ONGOING A PROPOSAL TO TAKE THE PROGRAM. ALIGNMENT TO NEED IN THE OUT YEARS. I LOT THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IS NEW. IT'S A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE. THIS INITIATIVE WILL UTILIZE THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER MORE EFFECTIVELY. IT WILL BE LED BY THE CALIFORNIA CLAPPER TO FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE A ALONG WITH A A LEAD COUNTY THAT'S BEEN CHOSEN. AB THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ORANGE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE. PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF HIGHER LEARNING HOW TO EXPAND AND STUDY THE EXISTING MULTI TIERED SYSTEM SUPPORT FRAMEWORK. BUT TO FOCUS THIS ON OF SCHOOL CLIMATE POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE. FOR THE ONGOING EXPENDITURES ARE SPENDING PROPOSALS AGAIN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE MAJORITY IS GOING TO THAT. AND THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE ALPHA FIVE THIS COVERS THE INCREASE OF THE COLA COLA PERCENTAGE WENT FROM TWO POINT FIVE ONE PERCENT TO TWO POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT OVER THIS. PERIOD I'M IN ADDITION THERE'S AN A HUNDRED SIXTEEN. IT'S MILLION DOLLAR BASED INCREASE A AND THAT WILL COVER THE INCREASE IN SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT AS WELL THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE COLA OF THREE PERCENT WHEN YOU OUT THE WHO WOULDN'T SIX. IN. SO TOTAL FUNDING I'M IN THIS PROPOSAL HEALTHY FF IS RECEIVING AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. ALL STATUTORY COLAS ARE RECEIVING THE INCREASE TO THE TWO POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT IN THIS PROPOSAL. OTHERS ALSO A TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON GOING FOR THE K. TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROPOSAL. THIS IS TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA. AND FINALLY ABOUT THIS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN INCREASE PERFECT AMOUNT OF NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. A THIS IS TO EXPAND IT AFFECT THAT SUPPORT BOTH IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO TO OFFER MORE PROACTIVE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WITH QUALIFIED INTERIM BUDGET STATUSES IN OTHER WORDS WILL DISTRICTS THAT ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISTRESS. SAID THAT. PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE MAJOR PROPOSAL CHANGES ARE MADE VISION FOR K. TWELVE I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE CUTTING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSALS ANOTHER HEARINGS. THANK YOU ELIA. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KENNETH UPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE COVERING. OR ANALYSIS OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE CERTIFICATION PROPOSAL BUT MY COLLEAGUE COVER SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS. AND I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A REPORT TO OUR OFFICE RELEASED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. SO IF YOU HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION SAY AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN FIGURE ONE ON PAGE THREE OF OUR REPORT. AT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET PERIOD IS UP SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION OVER THE JNUARY BUDGET ESTIMATES. AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE SPECIFIC TESTS AND FACTORS BUT STEPPING BACK A LITTLE BIT THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT INCREASED REALLY IS THAT IT'S THE RESULT OF TWO CHANGES. BUT HALF OF THE INCREASE IS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATES COMPARED JANUARY. AND THE OTHER HALF IS DUE TO THAT A PROPOSAL TO RE BENCH OR ADJUST THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UPWARD. AFTER THE SHIFT OF PRESCHOOL COSTS THAT THE STATE. INITIATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AS FAR AS THE GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEED. DESPAIR VISION REALLY IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS. I REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE A FEW BILLION HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE PERIOD. A MAINLY DUE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF HIGHER PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUE. BUT EVEN IF THOSE ESTIMATES MIGHT WHICH MATERIALIZE THE WAY WE ARE PROTECTING OUR OUTLOOK THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULDN'T BE ANY HIGHER THAN WHAT. I EAT YOU SEE TODAY. IN FACT WE THINK THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GUARANTEE I'M NOT AS LIKELY TO BE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ESTIMATES. AND THAT'S LARGELY DUE TO WHAT DIFFERENCES I ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT STUDENT ATTENDANCE. ADMINISTRATION SIMILAR TO JANUARY. ASSUMES THAT IS ENOUGH OF AN INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE TO TRIGGER A SPECIAL. PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT AYE PREVENTS THE GUARANTEE FROM DROPPING. A PRELIMINARY DATA FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SUGGEST THAT'S. NOT LIKELY TO BE THE CASE SO THE I GUARANTEE COULD END UP A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BELOW. ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE MAYOR VISION RIGHT NOW. I TUNING TO PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. THAT WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES ARE A LITTLE LOW THERE A GROWTH IN HOUSING PRICES HAS BEEN VERY STRONG OF LATE THE NUMBER OF NEW BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED HAS BEEN ON THE RISE. SO WE THINK PROPERTY TAXES OVER THE THREE YEARS I LIKELY TO BE UP AROUND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OVER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES. THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT NOT SO MUCH FOR ITS EFFECT ON SCHOOL FUNDING PUT FOR THE WAY THAT THAT FREES UP. HALF FUNDING FOR OTHER PRIORITIES IN YOUR BUDGET. TRYING TO CERTIFICATION I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WALKED YOU THROUGH KIND OF THE MECHANICS OF HOW THAT WOULD WORK. ON OUR JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK RECAP OF ONE COMPONENT OF THAT PROPOSAL WHICH IS THIS NEW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY COMPLEX PROPOSAL BUT IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE A LOT OF HUMILITY FAMILIARITY WEST ON THIS COMMITTEE. WHICH IS THOSE UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE <u><c.green>.</c></u> I'M TIMES THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE INCREASES AFTER WE ADOPT THE BUDGET SOMETIMES IT FALLS AND THE RESULT IS THAT A HIGH SCHOOL FUNDING ARE RELATIVE TO THAT NEW GUARANTEE IS OFTEN. A HIGHER LOWER THAN WHAT YOU INTEND. IN CASES WHERE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS DROPPED. BY THE STATE IN THE PAST HAS OFTEN RESPONDED BY SCORING SOME OF THAT MONEY ABOVE THE GUARANTEE QUITE A DIFFERENT FISCAL YEAR WHERE IT HASN'T FULLY FUNDED THE GUARANTEE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY IS TO AUTOMATE THAT PROCESS AND SO AS PART OF A REGULAR. ROUTINE BUDGET CLOSE UP PROCESS STATE WITHOUT FUNDING. AS CLOSE TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T PREVENT YOU FROM FUNDING MORE THAN THE GUARANTEE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU INTEND. ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL A. MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN INADVERTENTLY. OVERALL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AT CERTIFICATION PROPOSAL OFFER SOME CLEAR ADVANTAGES OVER THE CURRENT PRICE. IT'S MY TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLICATION THE FACTORS. IT PROMOTES FASTER RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. PLUS FINANCIALLY RISKY FOR THE STATE. IN SOME CASES THE STATE HAS HAD TO RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT. I INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEE OFTEN MANY MANY YEARS AFTER THE YEAR IS OVER AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T. HAPPENED A FEW CERTIFIED IN LOCKDOWN THE GUARANTEE IN A MORE TIMELY WAY. AND FINALLY WE THINK IT'S THERE'S A CLEAR OUTLINE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IT LETS YOU HOLD AYE ONE INDIVIDUAL THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY CERTIFICATION OF THE GUARANTEE EACH YEAR. AS WE RECOMMEND A APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I JUST WITH ONE MODIFICATION TO REMOVE THE CAP THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TALKED ABOUT WE JUST THINK THAT THAT ADDS SOME UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY. AND AND DOESN'T HELP ADVANCE AUTO BUT THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO COVER THE K. TWELVE. AND REALLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS. SEN JENNIFER CAN. I MAKE YOU TURN THE PAGE A AND NINE OF THE REPORT YOU CAN SEE THE BREAKDOWN OF NINETY EIGHT FUNDING JUST FOR KEY TWELVE EDUCATION. AND ON FIGURE THREE YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THAT ITEMIZE CHANGES AND MAY BOTH ONGOING AND ONE TIME. I FINANCE LAID THOSE OUT SO I WAS GONNA SPEND MOST OF MY TIME HERE ON FIGURE FOR WHICH IS HITTING THE MAIN OF PAGE ELEVEN. THE MAIN PROPOSALS AND MAY AND OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THEM. AND SO HITTING SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON THE DISCRETIONARY GRANTS THE FUNDING HAS UP WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED THAT IF THE STATE USES THE APPROACH IT'S BEEN USING OF JUST GIVING IT OUT ON EIGHTY A WITHOUT ANY REAL. CONNECTION SOME MANDATES THE STATE WILL NOT REDUCE THE MANDATE BACKLOG IT'LL JUST ON THE BOOKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME. ON THE ONGOING FUND IN THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION OF THAT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION IS ON TOP OF THE TARGETS. SO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OF ONCE YOU REACH THE TARGETS HOW MIGHT YOU WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ABOVE AND SO YOU JUST INDICATE THAT YOU HAVE CHOICES ABOUT THAT. HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION WHETHER YOU USE THAT AS THEY AS THEY PROPOSE FOR INCREASES IN ALL OF THE RATES COMPARABLY OR INVESTED IN THE BASE OR THE SUPPLEMENT YOU HAVE CHOICES IN THAT REGARD. WITH AUTOMATING THE COLA FOR ELSE YOU HAVE TO. PUT UP GRADINA AND TAKING IT OUT OF THE BUDGET CONVERSATION WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THAT PIECE OF THAT THIS IS THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUDGET DECISIONS YOU MAKE EVERY YEAR. IS HOW MUCH DO YOU WANNA AUGMENT LCF OFF BY. SO WHEN WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR'S BASS AS ADJUSTED FOR INCUMBENTS THOSE ARE MORE AUTOMATIC BUT IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION WE SUGGEST YOU RETAIN NOT AUTHORITY INSIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. THEY HAVE TO PROPOSALS AND MAY RELATED SU WHAT'S CALLED THE L. PACK OR THE NEW STYLE TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFESSOR PROFICIENCY EXAM. ONE IS TWENTY TWO MILLION TO MAKE WHAT IS NOW PAN AND AND PENCIL I'M SORRY PENCIL AND PAPER INTO COMPUTER. COMPUTER BASED. THE COST ESTIMATE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISE IS ABOUT TWICE WHAT IT COST JUST TO DEVELOP THE TYPE. AND ALL THAT'S HAPPENING IS MOVING UP FROM THE PAPER VERSION TO THE COMPUTER VERSION IT'S NOT A COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TEST IT REALLY IS JUST ALLOWING THE TASK TO BE MADE. ON COMPUTER SO WE THINK THIS IS MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE SO JUST YEAR ADOPTED FOR THE TIME BEING ASK FOR A BIAS PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR. THERE'S SIX MILLION BEING REQUESTED FOR. ALTERNATIVE EL CAP THAT WOULD SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE STATE TO DATE HAS NEVER HAD SUCH A TASK. ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS TAKE THE TUSTIN ALTERNATIVE TEST EACH YEAR AND RIGHT NOW I A P. TEAMS ARE DECIDING WHAT ALTERNATIVE TO USE. THERE COULD BE A CASE TO BE MADE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A UNIFORM ALTERNATIVE BUT IT ISN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR AT THIS POINT WHETHER THAT'S ESSENTIAL. SO HERE WE ARE JUST ADJUSTING GIVE ME. DON'T JUDGMENT CLARA YOU TALK ABOUT THE EL PACK YES THAT THE THE NEW SELF IF YOU ASK I THINK. SO ON THIS ONE IS TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD BE FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS BUT AGAIN THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE IT TO DATE THERE'S A. FEW STUDENTS THAT TAKE THAT OUT SO THIS IS JUST ADJUSTING ON THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS OF THE DEPARTMENT CAN CLARIFY THAT IT IS REQUIRED THAT THE STATE PROCEED IN THIS FASHION. YOU COULD WITHHOLD AND AGAIN REVISIT NEXT YEAR YOU COULD GET BETTER ABSTINENCE ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF HOW MUCH IT WILL COST. THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IN BED AT THE TO THE ONE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT AND THE COMPUTER ASSESSMENT SO IT'S HARD FOR US RIGHT NOW TO DISENTANGLE IF YOU ONLY DID WANTED TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER. ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT LAST YEAR YOU INCREASE THE GRANTS AMOUNT FROM SEVEN FIFTY TO ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND AT THE TIME IT WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU COULD DO THAT WITHIN THE AND TWELVE MILLION. THE ESTIMATES AT THE TIME WERE NOT VERY GOOD SO THE PROGRAM IS COMING IN MUCH MORE EXPENSE OF TODAY. AND THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL HAS. PROPOSALS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN AUGMENT AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT WE WAS JUST UP THE US MINT STILL HURT VERY GOOD SO IN RUNNING INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS WE THINK IF YOU WANNA GET AT THIS HIGHER LEVEL THE ELEVEN HUNDRED IT WOULD TAKE MORE MONEY IN BOTH YEARS. SO WE HAVE THE ESTIMATES HERO CHICK TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO IS A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE THE PROGRAM AGAIN AS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE BILLION LAST YEAR SO PROVIDING A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION A SUBSTANTIAL. SO WE ALSO GIVE YOU JUST AN OPTION IF YOU WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER PUPIL MAX MIGHT NOT COST SUBSTANTIALLY LAST IT'S STILL COST MORE THAN LAST YEAR EIGHT MILLION. ON THE SCHOOL CLIMATE INITIATIVE THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. IT'S BUILT OFF OF THIS MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH IS JUST A TERMINOLOGY THAT'S BEING USED FOR CHINA HAVE STRATEGIES FOR DEALING LARGELY WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES IN DEALING WITH A IN THE GENERAL EDUCATION CITING. THE STATE PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION TO THESE TWO COUNTY OFFICES TO DO WORK LIKE THIS JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR Y. THERE'S STILL AN ISSUE OUT THERE WHAT EXACTLY IS THE ISSUE OUT THERE. AND MORE OVER SO THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IS ADDED WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PART OF MONEY VERSUS THE THIRTY MILLION YARDI PROVIDED. BUT IT WON'T GIVE YOU AN EXPENDITURE PLAN UNTIL DECEMBER SO IT'S ASKING YOU TO PROVE FIFTY MILLION YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONNA KNOW HOW THE MONIES WILL BE SPENT. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT UNIQUE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TRACK WHETHER YOU'VE SOLVED AT A YEAR FROM NOW. ON THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROPOSAL IT'S A PRETTY MODEST CHANGE TO JUST ADD THE TWO MILLION FOR ADMINISTRATION WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL THE SAME ISSUES WITH HOT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WITH THE PROPOSAL. THE NEXT THREE PROPOSALS LISTED ON FIGURE FOR OUR ALL WITH THIS NEW SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR LOW PERFORMING DISTRICTS. THE MAY REVISION TRIES TO LAND A LOT MORE CLARITY TO WHAT COUNTY OFFICES ARE DOING AND SO IF YOU WANT COUNTIES TO BE AGAIN WE WERE SUGGESTING YOU DON'T TAKE THIS APPROACH BUT IF YOU DO IF YOU WANT COUNTIES TO BE THE CORE SUPPORT PROVIDER. WE THINK SOME OTHER CLARIFICATIONS ARE USEFUL AND YOU COULD GO EVEN FURTHER YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY THAT COUNTIES ARE THE ONES TO DO THAT ON A VACATION OF ROOT CAUSES. THE PERFORMANCE DATA REVIEW AND TO HELP IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES FOR REFORM. AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE THE COLLABORATIVE GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT COUNTIES AND HAVING THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT. THEY'RE STILL THIS WHOLE REGIONAL LEVEL THAT WE THINK IS EXTRANEOUS AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU DO BILL THAT REGIONAL LAYER YOU WON'T KNOW WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE IS THAT THE COUNTY IS THE RETURNS AT THE COLLABORATIVE THE ROLES BECOME VERY. INTERTWINED IN A WAY THAT ACCOUNTABILITY BECOMES ALMOST. I WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. THE LAST ONE IS FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COLLABORATIVE TO DO PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THE COLLABORATIVE RIGHT NOW DOES FIFTY SIX OF THE USE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS. SO WE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT ONE ARE MORE OF THEM TO DO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT YOU COULD JUST WRITE BUDGET PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WITHIN THE COLLABORATIVE AND DIRECT THEM TO DO THAT WE DON'T THINK THEY NEED MORE MONEY FOR IT. YOUR AGENDA ALSO COVERS EARLY EDUCATION AND THERE'S ONLY THERE'S FEWER ISSUES AND EARLY HEAD BUT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN. YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL. WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM A REVISION TO THE JANUARY BUDGETON THE BOTTOM LINE NOT MUCH CHANGE. BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER AT FIGURE SIX ON PAGE FIFTEEN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THAT'S NETTING OUT TO A BOTTOM LINE THAT WERE ISN'T CHANGING. PARTICULARLY MUCH. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR FIGURE SEVEN PAGE SIXTEEN I'M JUST GONNA HIGHLIGHT THE BIG MOVING PIECES SO THE BIGGEST ISSUE BEFORE YOU. IS THAT POWER X. CHILDCARE ESTIMATES ARE COMING A MUCH HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THE STATE DID SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGES THEY SAID RATHER THAN A FAMILY HAVING TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THEY ONLY HAD TO MAINTAIN IT AT A POINT IN TIME. DURING THE YEAR AND THEN THEY INCREASE PREVIOUSLY THE STATE JUST HAD AN ENTRY AND EXIT THRESHOLD THAT WAS A TENTACLE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. THE STATE CREATED AN ACCESS THRESHOLD WHICH WAS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. AND THEY ALSO CHANGE THE INDEX THEY WERE USING FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN INDEX TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN AND DUCKS THIS MEANT THAT THE EXIT THRESHOLD FOR A FAMILY OF THREE MOVE FROM SOMETHING LIKE FORTY THOUSAND TO SIXTY THOUSAND. SO THE ESTIMATES AT THE TIME OF WHAT IT WOULD COST TO DO THESE THINGS AGAIN WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD SO THE COSTS ARE COMING AND SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER. YOU JUST AROUND A SECTION LETTER TO FUND A DEFICIENCY AND COWARDS CHILDCARE HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION IN ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO COVER THESE COSTS. AB BUT WE THINK IT'S FALLING SHORT OF WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO COVER THE COST WE THINK THE COST IS PROBABLY AT LEAST FIFTY NOTES FIFTY MILLION MORE. AND THIS IS USING OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES WE THINK OCCUR COME ON IN AS HIGH AS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR MORE. SO IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE THE AUGMENTATION OF AN EXTRA FIFTY YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF IN A POSITION SIX MONTHS FROM NOW WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS A SHORTFALL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT THAT TIME TO COVER IT WE DON'T RECOMMEND YOU COVER IT NOW. FOR EARLY AND AND THERE'S NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE INITIATIVE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL OUR SING CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY YOU COULD BE USING FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW TO HELP CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WORK WITH STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. SO YOU HAVE ABOUT NINETY THREE MILLION YOU ARE THE PROVIDING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MONIES ABOUT HALF OF WHICH GOES TO TRAINING. IN THE MAY REVISION THERE'S ANOTHER SEVENTEEN MILLION AND FEDERAL CARRYOVER THAT IS SPECIFICALLY USED FOR TRAINING. AND THEN THE STATE WAS NOTIFIED JUST WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT IT'S GOING TO GET TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION BOTH IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND AGAIN IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THAT IT CAN USE FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES TRAINING BEING ONE SO WE THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT'S JUST ATTACHING THE MONEY AND THE PRIORITY THOUGHTS ARE IN YOUR BUDGET. AND THEN LASTLY. SEDIA IS REQUESTING SOME MONEY TO ADMINISTER THESE COUNTY PILOT PROGRAMS. I MEAN WE WERE JUST. RECOMMEND YOU REVISIT IT NEXT YEAR. CD GIVE US A PROPOSAL IN THE FALL BUT IT WAS BEFORE YOU TOOK ACTION AND MAY I'M SORRY AND MARCH TO STREAMLINE ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM SO IT SHOULD BE EASIER FOR THEM TO ADMINISTRATE. AND ADMINISTER THE PILOTS RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE VERY SIMILAR RULES NOW. AND THAT INFORMATION WE'VE GOTTEN TO DATE DOESN'T SPECIFY ALL THE THINGS THEY NO LONGER NEED TO DO BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE IN THE PILOT AND NOT IN THE REGULAR PROGRAM SO THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE SLOTS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REGULAR PROGRAM IN CD WOULD HAVE BEEN. DOING WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND HAVEN'T SORT OF BACKED OUT THE SAVINGS TO GET FROM NO LONGER HAVING TO DO THAT WORK SO IF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD COME BACK NEXT YEAR SORT OF NET OUT THEN YOU COULD REVISIT THAT THE PROPOSAL AT THAT TIME. SO THAT'S A REVIEW OF THE KEY TWELVE AND EARLY ADD ME REVISE PURPLES. THANK YOU. SURE NICK SCHWEITZER DEPARTMENT HEAD. SO YOU KNOW GENERALLY WERE WERE WERE POSITIVE ON THIS MAY REVISION. US START WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT WE CERTAINLY VERY STRONGLY AS SUPPORT THE STREAMLINED CERTIFICATION LANGUAGE. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. UNDER APPROPRIATIONS BE IDENTIFY QUICKLY IN THAT MONEY BE. DISTRIBUTED TO SCHOOLS EXPEDITIOUSLY. ARE WE ALSO SUPPORT THE RE BRANCHING OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR THE FULL DAY PRESCHOOL. AUGMENTATION THAT WAS DONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE WE BELIEVE THIS IS CERTAINLY A MUCH BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER MECHANISMS THAT MAY. BE USED TO LIMIT OVER APPROPRIATIONS SUCH AS CLAW BACKS AND OR DELAYING. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS WHICH WE'VE SEEN PROPOSED IN THE PAST. AND THEN WE WE VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE THE. THE. CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF EL CFF AND THE. GRANTING OF THE AUTOMATIC COOL WAS. WE THINK THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CONTINUED STABILITY OF OF SCHOOL FUNDING. WORK WITH REGARD TO THE EL PACK. HERE WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE IS A VALUE TO DELIVERING THAT ASSESSMENT VIA COMPUTERS AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT FOR THE OPAC IS IS REQUIRED. WE'RE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING THE. THE EL PACK NEXT YEARS SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT TO. BEGIN NEW MOVING TO GET THOSE THOSE PIECES IN PLACE. EARLY EDUCATION. Y. CALL OUT THE EARLY THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSAL FROM THE THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS AND. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION GENERAL WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS INCLUSION EARLY EDUCATION SHOULDN'T BE ANY DIFFERENT. BEYOND THIS THIS IS GOING TO HELP SUPPORT. MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION FOR EARLIER EDUCATION. I'M. THE OTHER THING ON EARLY HEAD IS WERE REGARD WITH REGARD TO THE PILOTS. THOSE PILOTS WHO ARE NINE OF THEM WERE PROVED THAT LAST YEAR AND. WE THINK THE THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO US TOO AT BEGIN. IMPLEMENTING THOSE THOSE PILOTS IS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO. MOVE FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY. THEN FINALLY. WANNA CALL OUT ONE AREA OF CONCERN CONTINUED CONCERN WITH THE MAYOR VISION AND THAT IS OF COURSE WITH THE. STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. WE DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S. EFFORTS TO REACH OUT AND AND. MODIFY THE PROPOSAL BASED ON INPUT FROM THE FIELD. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW WE WE CAN. CAN YOU TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THOUGH THE ROLE OF K. TWELVE AND AND THE INFLUENCE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND CONSORTIUM LEVEL. AND SERVE YOU KNOW HOW HOW THIS PROGRAM CAN BE BEST ALIGNED WITH THE EXISTING. K. TWELVE CD PROGRAM ARE QUE TWELVE CT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS</c></u> AS. BASED ON THE. THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY PROPOSING TO. HAVE THE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS ALL OF A FEW BUT FIRST MR O'DONNELL. BUT THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. ON MY FIRST QUESTION MAY BECOME AN A QUESTION ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT GIVES ME A LOT OF CONCERN. MY BASIC CONCERN IS THAT IF FURTHER EMPOWERS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVER THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS A BIT AYE CHANGES THAT SEE CHANGES THE PROCESS FOR CERTIFYING THE FINAL CALCULATION. PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR GUARANTEED THE GUARANTEE FOR PRIOR YEARS. CURRENTLY IT'S DONE BY A TEAM RIGHT THE S. P. AYE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ENGAGE IN THAT NOW IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS THE YES CORRECT CLICK THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE SINCE THREE THOUSAND EIGHT NINE. GREAT. BUT THIS PROPOSAL LAWS TO PART OF FIGHTS ALONE. TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT LEVEL SHOULD BE. IN THE LAST PART OF FINANCE TO COUNT ANY FUNNY ABOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE TO MEET FUTURE PROP NINETY EIGHT OBLIGATIONS. SO YOU MIGHT MIGHT THEM INTO MY OVERALL PERCEPTION AGAIN AS IT EMPOWERS THE. REJECT EXECUTIVE BRANCH. MORE THAN. THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AND IT ALONE OF THE NET EFFECT WILL BE THAT IT IT MAKES THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE A MAXIMUM AS WELL AS A MINIMUM. AND WHAT IF WE INTEND TO GO ABOVE. THE THE MINIMUM LEVEL. IN THEY'RE THERE'S BEEN A PREVIOUS COURT CASE PREVIOUS COURT CASE NEW CTE VERSE CALL COOL WHERE I'D MIKE TO DO KNOWLEDGE IS BOTH SPEECHES JUST IF YOU COULD JUST WE CAN FINISH HIS THOUGHTS. THIS THIS CONFLICT WITH THAT IS THAT VIOLATE. THAT AGREEMENT AGAIN WHAT'S WRONG WITH. FUNDING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. OVER THE MINIMUM I OR FORTY SIX THE NATION GIVE OR TAKE. ON A PER PUPIL FUNDING SO SO THIS THIS THIS PROPOSAL GIVES ME A LOT OF CONCERN AND I'M WONDERING WHY ARE WE DOING THIS. SO VIRTUAL Y. READING THIS SIGNAL WHAT YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT AFFECTS BECAUSE AGAIN I I BELIEVE THAT THE THE SEACM THAT MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THAT AGAIN IT EMPOWERS THE. EXECUTIVE ORDER THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. IF I MAY ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO THIS PROCESS REALLY IS NOT ON SIMILAR A IT IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING SO IT IN PAST CERTIFICATIONS OF THE THE S. P. AYE THE CHANCELLOR'S. OFFICE THEY PROVIDE FINANCE WITH ALL OF THE ALLOCATIONS APPROPRIATIONS PROPERTY TAXES FTS IS IN A. THEIR EIGHTY A AND SO THEY WOULD COMPILE THAT INFORMATION BUT FINANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE THE KINDS THAT'S THE GUARANTEE. WE AND THE FACTORS ARE ALL SAID IN LAW AS THEY STAND SO. IT REALLY JUST MAKES IT A MORE FORMAL PROCESS AND DOESN'T THEN REQUIRE. EVERYONE TO SIGN OFF ON IT IT JUST IT'S POSTED HOWEVER THERE IS THAT PERIOD WHERE EVERYONE CAN. SPEWED IT AND THAT. AGAIN NOW IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW AT LEAST THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD BE GOING FORWARD SO THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORE POWER TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHICH THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT IT HAS ACTUALLY. BUT AGAIN WHY CHANGE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NO I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ACCOMPLISHES BY CHANGING THE EXISTING PROCESS OTHER THAN. SOLIDIFIES POWER. ALSO THE EXISTING PROCESS THERE IS IS NOT WORKING THIS IS WHY IT'S NOT BEEN CERTIFIED SINCE A NOT ABSENCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE AGREED OF TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS WORKING THERE'S SEVERAL PROBABLE SO FIRST OF ALL THE PROCESS THE NINE MONTH THE TIME FRAME IS TOO SHORT FINAL FACTORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE SO WE'D BE ACTUALLY CERTIFYING PRIOR TO EVEN HAVING THE LAST. LOOK AT REVENUE THAT'S. AND THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CHANGES YU CAN SEE IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN RIGHT NOW WE JUST AT MAY REVISION CHANGED REVENUES AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO. SO THERE'S THAT AND THEN ALSO THERE'S JUST BEEN ONGOING INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCES THIS WOULD JUST SORT OF FORCED THE CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN ANNUALLY AND SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS NOW AS OPPOSED TO. KICKING THAT. THESE DISCUSSIONS AND CANS DOWN THE ROAD TO DO YOU SEE THE NET RESULT. IN IS THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT THE GUARANTEE WOULD BE A MAXIMUM WAS WELL AS A MINIMUM THAT PUT THAT MINIMUM GUARANTEE CAN BE SET AT ANY LEVEL THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES IT TO BE SO YOU CAN OVER TO PROGRAM AND PROVIDE. YOU CAN PROVIDE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED THIS JUST GIVES THE STATE SOME FLEXIBILITY WHEN THE WHEN WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THAT ADDITIONAL AMOUNT. SO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEES OF APPROPRIATED REVENUES. DROP SUBSTANTIALLY MAY GIVE SOME LIMITED FLEXIBILITY AGAIN THE ONE PERCENT CAP WOULD ONLY ALLOW THAT JUST WENT UP TO YOU KNOW IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. DO ANY OTHERS WAS STILL PLAYING ON THE. DELEO. NOT OR MAYBE JUST A YOU KNOW THIRTY OF ONE PERSPECTIVE ON THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THE WAY THAT THE PROCESS. WORKS NOW EVEN THOUGH IN THEORY THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE CHANCELLOR SIGNED OFF ON US IN REALITY ALL OF OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT CALCULATIONS. BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE GUARANTEE OF OUR REFLECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN. WHEN YOU USE YOUR LEVERAGE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS TO. SORT OF REACH AN ALTERNATIVE AGREEMENT TO USE A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF THE WORD BEING LEVERAGED. SO. I I THINK WHATEVER WHATEVER CERTIFICATION YOU PROCESS YOU ADOPT AND WHETHER IT'S. WHAT IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE WAY YOU KEEP THE OLD PROCESS OF THE NEW PROCESS MEAN YOUR A SORT OF? ROLL AND CERTIFICATION WILL BE. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND. UNDER THE YOU KNOW IN SOME SOME OF THE FACTORS LIKE REVENUE AREN'T REALLY FINAL AT. IN MAY REVISION BUT NEVER THE LESS THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO AGREE ON THOSE FACTORS IN THE BUDGET. AND THROUGH THAT. PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOVERNOR YOU COULDN'T YOU COULD ADOPT A DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. TOP PROPOSES IS PART OF THAT TENTATIVE CERTIFICATION. THANK YOU I THINK AGAIN I THINK THE KEY WORD USER WAS LEVERAGE AND THAT THAT THAT THAT WORD. GIVES ME CONCERNS THAT THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE THE MOTIVE. THERE YET SO I WOULD I WOULD PUT OUT FROM FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT IT'S ONLY THE. THIS INITIAL SERVE OCCASIONS GONNA HAPPEN AFTER THE BUDGET BUT CHARLIE OWN FUTURES CERTIFICATIONS AS AS THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED. ARE KIND OF A LINE WITH THE MAY REVISION WERE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ANNOUNCE THEIR THEIR FINDINGS AND THE DATA BUT FINE BEHIND THEM AT THE TIME OF MAY REVISION AND THEN ALLOW FOLKS TO WEIGH IN. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WAY AND. THROUGH THAT MAY REVISION PROCESS AND DURING THE THE BUDGET ADOPTION PROCESS I'M THE THE ONLY THE ONLY ISSUE WOULD BE A SO THAT. THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO THAT. WILL BE SHORT BUT. IT'S ALL IN YOUR MAY REVISIONS ALWAYS A CRUNCH SO SO DOES THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORT THIS CHANGE YET. HE DOES SUPPORT DISEASE. THANK YOU. AND THEN A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS ON THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THIS IS. THIS IS GONNA GO TO THE THE. CE CC IS THAT CORRECT. I YOUNG THOUGHTS BERMAN OF FINANCE SO THAT THEIR TWO POINT THREE MILLION AND INITIATIVE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE GOING TO CEASE  <u><c.green>AS WELL AS THE CO</c></u> LEAD REGION AND THIS WAS ONE OF SANTA CO AT AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION CO LEAD. TO THE BECAUSE LEADING THIS INITIATIVE. SO DOES ADMINISTERING THE MONEY GET ME TELL YOU MY CONCERN MY CONCERN DE. IT MAY BE. IT MAY NOT EVEN BE ALLOWED KICK IN THIS MONEY GET DOWN TO NON PROFITS. I GUESS SO MY MY CONCERNS AND NONPROFITS ARE GONNA GET ON THE PROP NINETY EIGHT TRAIN. SEEK A BUNCH OF MONEY. RIGHT AND NOT BE EFFECTIVE. AND I'M PRETTY BLUNT MIGHT. QUESTION THERE MAYBE YOU CAN SO WE'RE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN OUR LANGUAGE. AROUND THIS INITIATIVE SO THAT THIS. THIS INITIATIVE IS BUT UP INTO THREE KIND OF FEEDS US OF THE FIRST PHASE. WILL BE CONVENING OF ONE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORK COMPRISED OF SCHOOLS THAT STAFF DISTRICT STAFF PARENTS. AND IT COULD BE EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS BUT THEM THE MAIN POINT OF THIS INITIATIVE IS TO IMPROVE. AND THE PARENT EASEMENT ASPECT OF OF LC ABOUT OF OF. OKAY. SO. I'M SORRY DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ARMY EFFORT THANK YOU. THEY CAN THEN THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THEIR BUT DID THIS CT AND MAYBE A STEP FOR THE PART OF FINANCE ON THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER COMMITTEE FORMED KIDDING WE ATE WE OTHER PROPOSAL THE NEW CD PROPOSAL WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON GOING. AND THEN THE CONSORTIA NOW OR ADDING IN THE K. TWELVE SELECTION COMMITTEE. SO THERE'S THERE'S MORE BUREAUCRACY WHAT WHAT IS THEIR FUNCTION. VERSES VERSUS THE CONSORTIA DON'T UNDERSTAND. EVER ALEXANDER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE KEY TWELVE SELECTION COMMITTEE WAS WAS PREVIOUSLY IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET KNOWN AS THE K. TWELVE SUBCOMMITTEE SO THAT'S NOT A NEW COMPONENT TO THEM A REVISED PROPOSAL. AND THAT IS A COMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO BE FORMED BY THE CONSORTIA IN THEY WILL BE CHARGED WITH MAKING THE CURRENT DETERMINATIONS AS WELL AS. THEY IT BE IT AMOUNT PER GRANT SO THE CONSUMER HOUSES CAN WORK SO THAT WE FORM CONSORTIA AND THEN THEY FORM A COMMITTEE WHO SELECTS THE COMMITTEE. AND. THAT OTHER GOING ON FLIGHTS WITHIN THE COMMITTEE OTHER POLITICAL BATTLES WHEN THE COMMITTEE TO THE MONEY THAT'S MY CONCERN AS WELL CONSORTIUM PROPOSAL BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T IT DEVOLVE INTO A BATTLE OVER DOLLARS SO THE COMMITTEE IS FORMED BY THE CONSORTIUM SO THE CONSORTIUM'S THE WHEN SELECTING WHO WILL SIT. ON THAT COMMITTEE ON THE MAY REVISE LANGUAGE DOES LAY OUT. SO. IT'LL BE COMPRISED OF CURRENT OR FORMER CLAY GOT WHILE AGAIN BUT YOU HAVE TO WE WE DO HAVE THOSE P. SAYS. WITH THE CONTROL FOR BIAS THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE MAY REVISE THAT IF YOU ARE A DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS SITTING ON THAT HE TWELFTH SELECTION COMMITTEE. THAT YOU HAVE PROPER PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED NOT CONFLICT WITH DECISIONS BEING MADE. JETS I STILL THINK THAT'S A. MORE GOVERNMENT AND AGAIN MORE GOVERNMENTS THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE I DON'T KNOW WHY THE INCENTIVE GRANT. DIDN'T WORK TEAMWORK MY PERSPECTIVE SO. I JUST WORRY THAT WE'RE CREATING MORE HURDLES AND MORE BUREAUCRACIES. BUT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND MY NEXT. QUESTION MAYBE THROUGH THE AUDIO ON THE OPAC TEST. SO THAT THAT'S GOING TO WORK TAKE WERE SEEKING TO TAKE THAT ELECTRONIC. IN SO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE TIMELINE BECAUSE THERE'S AN ISSUES IN THE PAST. AND KEY TWELVE SCHOOL STRIDES WITH. IN IDENTIFYING STUDENTS AND. IN ASSESSING THEM IN A CERTAIN TIMEFRAME. SO THAT WE GET THEM RECLASSIFIED IF NEED BE CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT. OUR COMPORT WITH EFFORTS TO GET THE TEST IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER. DO YOU KNOW TODAY. I'M AND HASN'T BEEN ARTICULATED TO US THAT AN OBJECTIVE OF MOVING FROM PAPER TO COMPUTER. IS TO. NECESSARILY EXPEDITE REDESIGNATIONS ALTHOUGH A COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM THEY DO TONS OF BE ABLE TO TRANSFER INFORMATION MORE QUICKLY TO TEACHERS SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD AMENDED ADS ELT AND RE CLASSIFICATION POLICIES. THAT JUST BY HAVING BY VIRTUE OF HAVING THEM FOR MISSION MORE QUICKLY THEY COULD RE DOESN'T ME SOONER BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY GO THAT NEXT STEP AND JUST BECAUSE THE TEACHER HAS THE BENEFIT OF THE DATA. THAT IT'S TRANSFERRED TO THE NEXT TEACHER AND NOT RE CLASSIFICATION OCCURS OR DESIGNATION ACROSS MORE QUICKLY. BUT AGAIN THE PROPOSAL IS COMING PRETTY QUICK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SO I'M NOT SURE THAT. YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF DETAIL OKAY. I HOPE SOMEONE HAS MORE NOT COUNTING ON YOU TO HAVE THEM TODAY UP. BUT SO SO. A TEST TO BE DELIVERED A CLASSROOM SETTING. STUDENTS PULLED OUT. HOWEVER IT WORKS LOGISTICALLY AND THEN THE RESULTS ARE SENT TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR WHO THEN ASSESSES. STUDENT. PERFORMANCE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE OF MY CONCERNS WHEN I CONCERNS IS. WE GIVE A STUDENT TESTS AND I THINK THE TEACHER EVEN PARTICIPATING GRADING SOME OF IT THEN IT SENT OFF TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR MOURNER WEISS WE SEND ANY OF IT OFF TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR. IF IF ISSUE IF IT TEACHERS ARE ENGAGING. IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE STUDENT WONDER HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS TO SEND IT OFF TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR MAY THAT'S A MUCH MORE RHETORICAL QUESTION. BUT. GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE. WELL I SUSPECT THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S PAPER COMPUTER I SUSPECT CD IS USING A VENDOR TO DEVELOP A TEST SINCE THE TEST WAS RATHER RECENTLY DEVELOPED THE CONVERSION FROM SOME OUTSIDE HELP PAT. AND I SUSPECT THAT A PORTION OF NOT ALL I A GOOD PORTION OF IT IS GREAT IT EFFECTIVELY IN A DATA IS TRANSFERRED IN TERMS OF SCORES BETWEEN THE VENDOR IN THE STATE. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE ANY COMMENT ON A SPECIFIC LOGISTICS THE TIMELINE TO GET THIS TEST. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW. PERFORMED AND THEN AND THEN THE RESULTS BACK THAT THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. STUDENTS ARE GETTING RECLASSIFIED TIME FOR THE NEXT YEAR. AND THEN. YEAH I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE EXPERT ON ON THIS EXAM OR OR HOW IT'S ADMINISTERED AND WOOD PRY NEED TO GET BACK TO YOUR MORE INFORMATION BUT COULD YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE DAY THAT'S FINE FOR SURE AND IT JUST GENERALLY YOU KNOW COMPUTER BASED TESTS. CAN ALLOW FOR MORE MORE EFFICIENCIES AND IN IN SCORING EXAMS THAN EIGHT CANCER YOUR QUESTION THAT AS TO WHY CONTRACTORS DO THE DO SCORING'S IN IN GENERAL. NOT AND I'M NOT THE CIVIC WEEK TALKING TO THIS TEST RANGE IN GENERAL WITH WITH TESTING YOU YOUR CONCERN WITH. VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY AND SOMETIMES THAT'S HARD TO CONTROL WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS. GRADING TESTS AS OPPOSED TO OF COURSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ACTIVELY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IN TERMS OF INVOLVING TEACHERS MORE IN THE IN THE GRADING ASSESSING OF EXAMS BUT IT IS IT IS THE COMPLEXITY I I UNDERSTAND THAT AND. I GUESS AND I'M ALMOST DONE HERE MISTER CHAIR I'M. I GUESS I OF MY UNDERSTANDS THEY ARE GREAT PART OF IT. SERVER GONNA READ PART OF IT ONE OF THE GREAT ALL THAT. THAT'S I THINK A QUESTION THAT SHOULD UNANSWERED LONG BEFORE THEY WENT OUT TO A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR BUT THAT. WE DON'T I DON'T NEED YOU TO RESPOND IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL HAS A VITAL INFORMATION THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON THE TIMELINE. LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPUTERIZED VERSION EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T ALL PACKED THAT'S NOT COMPUTERIZED. AND ALSO. WHAT IS THE ROLE THE PRIVATE CONTRACT WHAT IS THE ROLE THE CLASSROOM TEACHER? IN IN THE OPAC VERSES THE SELF. THANK YOU. I'M DONE. OKAY TRIPS PREPARING LABOR HERE. I WANTED TO IT TO GO TO THE EARLY AT SECTION REAL QUICK. AND. WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE OUR REQUESTS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE. YEAH EXPENDED SIGNIFICANT ANNA MONEY IN EARLY ADD NEWS THAT THE BILLION DOLLAR. NUMBER THROWN OUT THERE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I LEFT WILL CONSIDER IT BUT ONE PIECE THAT WE THINK IS. IS THAT IS THIS REALLY GREAT IN THE TABLE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE FEDERAL MONEY THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE LATEST CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET. ACTION. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA AND IN THE. CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT TONIGHT I DON'T SEE IT PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLAN SO. WHAT IF YOU COULD A PINE ABOUT THAT AND? YOU GO FIRST SHARPLY OUT OF FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO FORTUNATELY WE WERE UNABLE TO YOU I T. IN THE FINAL FEDERAL AUGMENTATION FOR CCTV DE. IN TIME TO MAKE IT AND TV AD MAYOR VISION. HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO FULLY FLESHED OUT A PROPOSAL AYE AS TO HOW TO SPEND THIS THIS AUGUST WANT HIM AUGMENTATION. AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE FULL FEDERAL GUIDANCE AS TO ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS THAT THESE THAT AUGMENTATION AND I WILL NEED TO ADHERE TAIL. AND ALSO WERE NOT CURRENTLY FULLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY BE G. AS THE LAW CURRENTLY STANDS. AS WE THINK THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS WE AYE DEVELOP A PROPOSAL AS TO HOW TO SPEND THE ONE TEN FIVE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT I PUBLIC COMMENT ES DE CLEAN KITCHEN PROCESS WOULD BE. A A BUT BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF WE DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THESE BUTTONS LABOR HAVING PUBLIC COMMENT HERE FOR SIX MONTHS ON THE. NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT ARE IN NEED N KIDS TRYING TO GET INTO QUALITY CHILDCARE AND EARLY PRE K. PROGRAMS AND SO. IF IF WE APPROPRIATED. OF THOSE DOLLARS. FOR THOSE PURPOSES THEM THE EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS THAT. WOULD THAT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT THAT. CONGRESSIONAL PLAN LAID OUT FOR STATES TO US TO LOOK AT. AT THIS BUT WE DON'T HAVE FULL FEDERAL GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT THE RULES ARE GOING TO BE REGARDING THE FUNDS SO WE FEEL IT'S TOO EARLY TO MAKE ANY. DECISIONS AS TO WHAT WHAT IT WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE. FAIR ENOUGH. DID DID LA ALL HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT I AM. OUR UNDERSTANDING AND TERMS OF USE OF THE FUNDS AS THAT. OF THE REGULAR. BLOCK GRANT RULES APPLY. BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REGULAR RULES AND CALIFORNIA A FEW YEARS AGO WAS FOUND NOT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE NO NO STATE WAS IN COMPLIANCE BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST CHANGED THE RULES AND THE FEDERAL RULES ARE NOW MUCH MORE STRINGENT FOR EXAMPLE DOING ANNUAL. INSPECTIONS RATHER THAN INSPECTIONS PERIODICALLY WHEN COMPLAINTS AROSE SO I THINK THE BIG DEBATE IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS YOU VERY LIKELY COULD USE THAT FOR SLOTS FOR RATES FOR TRAINING. FOR MAYBE EVEN FACILITIES. YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO BE MAKING YOU GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO DO WHAT THE FUNDS WOULD LIKE IF THEY HAD DONE A FINE BUT THEY REALLY DID WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING MORE WITH INSPECTIONS. OR OR NOT DO THINGS WITH LICENSE EXEMPTS YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES ON THOSE AREAS. BUT IT'S A GREAT THING TO BE THINKING ABOUT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA AS A STATE GET MORE MONEY SUBSTANTIALLY IN BOTH THE STE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NEXT YEAR SO TO BE THINKING ABOUT WITHIN THOSE BROAD PARAMETERS WHAT YOU'RE HIGHS PRODUCE WOULD BE. OKAY. TODD. HOW QUICK JUMP REAL QUICK TO CT  <u><c.green>I KNOW MR O'DONNELL</c></u> TALKS ABOUT IT SO WE WE HAD A? LENGTHY HEARING ABOUT THIS TWICE. AND. ARE TWO ISSUES WERE WHERE THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND DONE AND THE. AT THE LOCATION WHETHER IT'S THAT THAT THE NEW PROPOSAL OR GOING BACK TO CD. IT'S I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS LOOKING AT THAT AND SO. DON'T ASK CD <u><c.green>.</c></u> DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MEETS. THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU LAID OUT EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AS FAR AS THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE OVERSEER OF THE OF THE PROGRAM YEAH SO. I GUESS NO I MEAN THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT SO MUCH OF MY COMMENTS WERE I MEAN WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE. THE THE EFFORT. BUT YOU KNOW WE WE STILL THINK. ESSENTIALLY WE THINK WHERE WE WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. YEAH AND DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO PUT MORE RESOURCES. ON THE TABLE FOR THIS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO YEAH EXPAND ACCESS TO CT THREE DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ARE I WOULD EXPECT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PROBABLY YES BUT I NEED A PRIDE NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK. FAIR ENOUGH. MUSLIM MONTH. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE I HAVE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE AD THE FEDERAL. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT I GUESS. AS A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT FOR. OF OF THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR AN INCREASE. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD AND CHILD. CARE. AND. I AM NOT. I AM NOT CLEAR. WHY THE CHOICES BEING MADE TO HOLD ㎿ EXISTING PROGRAMS? SO I SAY I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS ALLUDING TO WHY WE'RE NOT INCLUDING THE FEDERAL TELL THEM OUT AGAIN AS AS A MAJOR EARLIER IS REALLY A MATTER OF NOT HAVING A A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALL OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE. A GOING TO BE ATTACHED TO THAT TO THOSE AT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT. AND AND AGAIN NOT BEING IN PHILLY FULLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CCTV G. REGULATIONS AS THEY CURRENTLY STAND AND WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. TO BECOME FULLY IN COMPLIANCE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPLIANCE ASK REQUIREMENTS ARE SO WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR YOU. TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT SURE THREE WE DO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RULES REGULATIONS ARE IN TERMS OF CCTV COMPLIANCE I THINK WHAT WHAT AT MY MY POINT IS WE DON'T HAVE FULL FEDERAL GUIDANCE AS TO. THE SPECIFIC AND RULES THAT WILL WILL BE ATTACHED TO THIS THIS ONETIME AUGMENTATION SO WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE FEDERAL RULES TO. FOR THIS ONE TIME AUGMENTATION SO. WE WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT WE GREAT WE'VE BEEN GATHERING INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND THEN BRADEN. WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE AYE CLOSELY IN ORDER THAT TO DETERMINE WHAT RULES THAT KIND OF WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE IS THAT COMES UP WE ARE NOT SURE WAY AND I FEDERAL GRANTS WILL BE RELEASED AND WHEN WILL THAT FUNDING HAD CALIFORNIA. I WILL NEVER FIRST I HAVE TO DEFER TO THE PART OF A COMPLETE BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT SO WITH THAT TIGHTLY AS. I HAVE TO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT APARTMENT HE'S AYE AND I THINK THAT THAT DIDN'T DO WE NOW. IT IT UNNATURAL TYPE OF THE ROAD I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW OCTOBER FIRST SO I DON'T KNOW IF. THAT'S FOR THE FALL AND I WOULD HATE TO HOLD OFF SO I'M USING IT ON HER AND NOT YOU KNOW I SEE IT AS AN INVESTMENT. AND SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY MY QUESTION START WITH WHY ARE WE NOT MAKING THE INVESTMENT AND I THINK IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT. FOR AND NUMBER OF MEMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SO I WANNA. ENCOURAGE US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT INVESTING THAT MANY. EVEN IF IT'S ONE TIME MANY UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE FUNDS I'M IN THIS SPACE I WORKED AS ONE YEAR WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE AT A TIME. AT AND SO I THINK THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS AT AN EFFORT THAT REALLY HIGH PRIEST MARRIOTT'S. AT FULL CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF. OF YOU FAST IMPLEMENTATION INVESTMENT. AND IF A FIVE MIGHT CLARIFY A OF THE ARE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO NOT USE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY LATE AUGMENTATION BUT RATHER JUST IT TO HOLD OFF AND IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. OF THE RULES REGULATIONS WITH SO DO YOU THINK YOU'LL USE IT AN ACADEMIC YEAR YEAH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A WERE REALLY SUCKS MOST OF THE TIME LINE. BUT IT GO THROUGH A SUPPLEMENTARY DEL PROCESS OR BE FUNDED THROUGH THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WHERE. WHERE OPEN TO DISCUSSING? TENANTS. THANK YOU. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAVEZ. I THINK THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH THE FEDERAL. IS THAT DAD THEY DEAL WITH A DIFFERENT FISCAL YEAR THAN CALIFORNIA. SO THERE FISCAL YEAR STARTS IN OCTOBER WERE OURS. SO THEY DO THE BUDGET CYCLE DEFINITELY USE THAT THE PROBLEM. THAT IT'S CRACKED. THE EVAN. I'M ONE OF WEIGH IN ON THE ISSUE OF EARLY CHILD EDUCATION DISRUPTING HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO THE REPUBLICANS. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO AS YOU GO BACK AND WORK ON THIS WITH THE FEDERAL ARE YOU FOR GOING HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THIS. ABOUT WE WANT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR EARLY CHALLENGE OCCASION. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION I'VE HAD THIS WITH THE GOVERNOR FEW TIMES ON YOU KNOW. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT UGH WILL LIKE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. NAM FIGURE FIVE OF THE. KELLY ó REPORT. IT TALKS ABOUT THE FEDERAL TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES. GONE FROM THREE EIGHTY NINE TO. MAY REVISE AS THREE THIRTY LAS A. FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT? IS THAT WHY WAS THAT REDUCE SHOULD YOU NINE MILLION DOLLARS. HELLO. I'M HERE FIGURE FIVE. I'M NOT ASKING YOU CAN YOU POINT YOUR WHERE YEAH YEAH I'M SORRY AND YOU KNOW WHAT I AM I'M SORRY. WORKING TNF IS USED ENTIRELY FOR STAGE ONE CHILD CARE IN AND SO IT BECOMES INVOLVED IN HOUSE STAGE ONE IS FUNDED WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS. PART OF THE SINGLE COUNTY ALLOCATION. SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE CONNECTED WITH WHAT'S HPPENING TO OVERALL CAO WORKS CASELOAD WHICH IS DECLINING FROM JANUARY TO MAY OVERALL CAL WORKS CASELOAD AND THE CHILD ASSOCIATED STAGE ONE CHILD CARE IS PROBABLY GONE DOWN SUCH THAT. THE WAY THE STATE TRADITIONALLY BUDGETS THAT IS YOU STAND UP JUST FOR THAT PARTICULAR STAGE. SO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A MECHANICAL ADJUSTMENT FOR HOW WE ASSESS. FUNDS STREAMS ACROSS THE PROGRAMS AND AS A STATE WE'VE JUST CHOSEN TO USE THAT FOR STAGE ONE. AS FOR I THOUGHT BECAUSE OF MY UNDERSTANDING. THERE'S A POT. HUMAN RESOURCES AND PART OF EDUCATION USE AND I WAS WONDERING HAS BEEN SHIFTED OVER THERE AWAY FROM. THIS POT IS THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HALF FOR MANY YEARS VAST BULK OF TANNA FRANCE GONE TO STAGE ONE I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COUPLE YEARS WHERE SLIVER WAS USED FOR STATES TO. BATES. SO YOU ARE TALKING AB PART OF FINANCE WHERE THE MONEY WENT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT THE STAGE ONE ALLOCATION AFTER TO FIRE AT YOU MAY SOCIAL SERVICES COLLEAGUES UP ON THAT. OKAY I'M. ON TO ANOTHER AREA OF INTEREST TO ME. IN NOT ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLIC CAUCUS IN AS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE. I'M LOOKING AT THE SHEET WAS GIVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE FRONT PAGE FIGURE FOR YES. AND I'M TRYING TO FIND SHE G. E. IN HERE. AND I DON'T SEE IT NOW I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CHANGE. FROM WHAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD SHE KEY WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE IS SHE TEAM EBAY IMPOSTER ANYMORE. WHAT WE DON'T IT? SO I IT IT'S LISTED AS K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IN ITS TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE ONGOING. IT'S YOUR THIRD ITEM DOWN IN THE ON GOING K. TWELVE SECTIONS TO HER FOURTEEN MILLION TOTAL. MMHM. SO OUR PROPOSAL IS NOT NURSES AT A AND WERE WERE WORKING IT AND IT'S QUIRK CALLING THAT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IT'S GREAT TECHNICAL EDUCATION BUT IT HAS A DIFFERENT FOCUS THEN. WHEN. FOR THERE IS TWO MILLION THAT THAT THE CLEAN MILLIONS THE ADDITION BECAUSE. THAT IS THE ADDITION OF US SOME PAYMENTS TO GO TO THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA IT'S FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SO THE NUMBER WE HAD DISCUSSED BEFORE WAS A LOT BIGGER THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION IT WAS YEAH THAT THEY THEY COMMITTEE YEAH WE WE SUGGESTED A HIGHER NUMBER AND CHANGING THE. THE ADMINISTRATION FROWNED. WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE IT HAS BEEN LAST YEAR'S AND IN CD. SO I HAD TO CHARGE THAT BECAUSE I WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WEEKS BUDGET WAS SIGNED ON TO THAT. NOW WAIT I GUESS TO FORTY TWO ONE OF FOURTEEN MILLION RICE THE TUNER FOURTEEN IS THE AMOUNT THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. RIGHT AND WE WANTED HIGHER NUMBER AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S WILL NOT THIS NUMBER IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT'S CORRECT. BURNETT FOR NOW. SO WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT WE'RE GOING BACK AND PUSH IN ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND SEEKING EASE I. JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT. AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER AREA. THE CHARTER SCHOOL GRANTS. IN THE HOLISTIC VIEW. I'M TO BRING EVERYBODY APPARENTLY. IT'S GOT A. I'M THE NICE GUY BY THE WAY. IS MY LAST HEARING YEAH. SO WE COULD CHARTER SCHOOL GRANT. IS IT A PLUS UP OR DOWN OVERALL AND ALL THE MOVEMENT IN NUMBERS AND. THAT TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING AND THEN. CHARTER SCHOOL OFFICIALLY GRANT PROGRAM AUGMENTATION. I WOULD BE MORE FUNDING FOR BOTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN UNDER THE MY REVISION MORE FUNDING YASSER IT WOULD GO UP UNDER THE MAYOR OF VISION TWENTY ONE MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AND THEY ARE THE HOW TO PROPOSAL IT WOULD GO ON TWENTY I AM FIVE MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS MORE. AND I'M GOING ON TWENTY FIVE W. SAID I'M SORRY. YA SO THERE WOULD BE OTHER SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS RUNNING A SHORTFALL SO THEY WOULD PROVIDE THE TWENTY ONE MILLION TO BACK FILL AND THEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION YES AND THE WAY YOU'RE SCORING AT JUST THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWENTY ONE AND THE TWENTY FIVE. FOUR MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR YEAH PLAY YAHTZEE ALL THE TIME OUT AGAIN THAT REALLY QUICK WITH THE NUMBERS. SO. IS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. NO WE DON'T THINK IF YOU WANTED TO FUND THE HIGHER MAXIMUM AWARD NO I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT IT'LL FALL SHORT. I I DEPARTMENT FINANCIERS SHIRTS EARNED BECAUSE I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS A BIG SUPPORTER DRIVERS GOAL SO. CHAIR SURELY GAP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE WAY THAT WE CAME UP WITH THIS CALCULATION WAS OUT WE WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY WHO ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DETERMINING HOW THE BEHAVIOR IS I'M ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND HOW THEY'RE REACTING TO THIS NEW POLICY ITS WRITER SINK THE WAY AT THE ALLEY O.. CALCULATED THE POLICY IS IF. EVERYBODY THEY IN HIS. ALL OF THE EIGHTY A IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM TIMES THAT BY THE HIGHEST GRANT AMOUNT NOW WE KNOW BASED ON PARTICIPATION THAT ONLY ABOUT. FORTY PERCENT ACTUALLY GET THE HIGHEST GRANT AMOUNT SO IF WE WERE TO GO WITH THE ALLEY OF NUMBER OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION. THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE OVER APPROPRIATING THE PROGRAM AND THEREFORE WE GET THE SAVINGS IN THE PROGRAM. MOVING FORWARD SO OUR APPROACH IS TO USE OUR OUR BEST ESTIMATES BASED ON BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CURRENT YEAR THAT ADJUSTING TO THE CURRENT ONTO THE NEW POLICY AS THE BUDGET ACT. AND THEN MOVING FORWARD ADDICT USING NOT FUNDING AS A BASE AND THEN WITH THE COLA. DRINK OUR DIFFERENCES ACTUALLY ARE ARE MUCH MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD I THINK THAT THEY ASSUME NO ATTENDANCE GROWTH OR VERY LITTLE ATTENDANCE GROW SOMETHING LIKE ONE PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACTUAL ATTENDANCE GROWTH CHARTER SCHOOL ADA SCORED IN THIS PROGRAM IS BEEN MORE LIKE FIFTEEN PERCENT ON AVERAGE SO WE USE LIKE A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE TO RUN OUR ESTIMATE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND I THINK THEY HOLD IT FLAT. BUT THIS NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE EIGHTY A IS WHAT DETERMINES THE GRANT AND NOW IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE FACILITIES COSTS AT LEAST COSTS. ARE WHAT DETERMINES THE GRANT AMOUNT THE PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAM. HEAVILY IS FUNDED ON FACILITIES AND LEASE COST RATHER THAN EIGHTY A SHARON THIS IS WAY TOO TACKY BUT WE LOOK AT LEAST COST TO THESE ARE LIVE LIKE BEING DRIVERS EIGHTY AND LEASE COSTS AND LEAST COSTS GO UP ON AVERAGE ABOUT SIX PERCENT A YEAR. FINANCE HOUSING TAPPED TO THE LEAST COST UNDER THEIR PROPOSAL AT THE KEY TWELVE COLA AND WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT AS WELL. SO ACTUALLY ACCOUNT THAT LEASE COSTS WILL NOT GROW AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY BECAUSE OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL IT'LL BE CAPPED AT MORE LIKE THREE RATHER THAN SIX PERCENT SO CAN THE BIG DRIVERS. AND. WELL I'M I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY OUT THERE ON THIS DISCUSSION OF WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THAT. HAVE MOUNTED STUDENTS GOING TO WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THE MEDIAN THE REQUIREMENT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF PEOPLE WE QUESTION AND HISTORICAL LINES IN. WE DON'T WANT OVER FUNDED SO YOU THINK YOU'RE FUNDING IT IS FULL NAY. THE LA O. DISAGREES SO. I DON'T. LATER ON IN THE TESTIMONY HOPE WILL HAVE SOME DETAILS WHAT THEY THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE FOR LET ME ASK THOSE THREE AREAS WE CARE ABOUT IS CHARTER SCHOOLS. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CT. WELL THANK YOU. AND THAT WILL SAVE ME HERE FAREWELL FOR THE FINAL HEARING A COUPLE DAYS. YEAH BUT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA COME BACK IN AND. AS YOU SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR IDEA TO MARINATE THESE IDEAS PROPOSALS AND COME UP WITH THEIR OWN PLAN FROM A COUPLE DAYS SO. FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE AT THE TAKE ROLL REAL QUICK. MCCARTY HERE CHáVEZ. HERE AMONG. MEDINA. FIRST CITY. O'DONNELL HERE. OKAY THANK YOU ARE THAT CONCLUDES THE OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. PROPOSALS FOR CAPE OF AN EARLY HEAD WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROCEED WITH. PUBLIC COMMENTS. IT COULD BE. SO PLEASE LINE AT FIRST WE WANT TO BRING UP. ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THEY ADMIT. DO YOU WANNA WAITED GO. WE HAVEN'T EVEN. OKAY YEAH WE CAN WAIT. THE. THAT'S OKAY SO IT SO WE CAN HAVE AND IN THE INTERIM PEOPLE BEHIND YOU GO. THAT. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASES THAT WERE SEEN TO LC FF FROM. DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CERTIFICATION IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR US AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE FINAL LANGUAGE. AND WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE IT MEETS ALL THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE BY DOWN THIS IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR US MORE ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF CONTINUES APPROPRIATION LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE SMALL FOR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BELIEVES HE WITH THAT VOICE HAVE WANTED TO UNDERSCORE SUPPORT FOR THE NOTION OF BECOMING MORE PARENT FRIENDLY AND TRANSPARENCY IN. THE DETAILS MATTER HERE WE'D LIKE TO BE AVAILABLE TO. YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO WORK EVEN FURTHER ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS. A MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT FROM JANUARY. ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S IT LOOKS TO BE A HUGE OMISSION OF LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS A SEVEN PERCENT SET ASIDE AND ESTHER. STATE FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH IS ANYWHERE FROM THAT STORY FEDERAL FUNDS COMING TO THE STATE AND STATE SET ASIDE AUTHORITY OF IT NEARLY HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THERE. IS. SHOULD SAM GONNA BE SPENT SOMEHOW BUT WITHOUT YOUR OVERSIGHT IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING BUT THE PART NUMBER HALF OF THE STATE'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION COALITION. I'M SO RECOGNIZING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND WERE ALSO ONLY SERVING FOURTEEN PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE.

AMERICAN YOU DON'T SECOND SOMEONE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE DR SUSAN EGGMAN CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS BUDGET REQUEST. OUR ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR BABIES ASK WILL DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SLOTS AVAILABLE INCREASE STATES RATES FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE. CREATE A NEW GRANT PROGRAM TO FUND IMPLEMENTATION AND START UP COSTS OF NEW CHILDCARE FACILITIES. AND ESTABLISH A FUND TO RECRUIT A NEW GENERATION OF FAMILY CARE PROVIDERS. A SECOND REQUEST FOR THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HIGHLIGHTING THE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM IS COMING AS WELL. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE GET THE BILLION FOR BABIES FUNDING BECAUSE THE INFANT TO TODDLER AGE GROUP IS WHEN FAMILIES STRUGGLE THE MOST TO FIND CARE. WHEN CARE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND WHERE THE STATE HAS LAGGED IN REINVESTMENT SINCE THE DEVASTATING CUTS DURING THE RECESSION THANK YOU. BUT IN THE MORNING I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID BUT I THINK JUST TO REITERATE I DON'T I'M SURE THERE'S NOT ONE OF YOU THAT WHO SET UP THERE WHO DON'T THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. A HIKE FOR KIDS TO HAVE APPROPRIATE CHILDCARE WE ALL KNOW THE RESEARCH ON A ZERO THREE AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. AND HOW HOW IT COSTS ARE THE BILLION DOLLARS IT WILL INVEST NOW WILL BE ABLE TO TO MAKE. CHILD BE ABLE HAVE A LIFETIME OF PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THAT WERE JUST OUT TALKING ABOUT ISSUES ARE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WE KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES A KID TO A GROWING UP IN IN NOW AIR AREAS ARE THEY REALLY NEED THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT. A BECAUSE WE NEED TO INCREASE AS MANY PROTECTIVE FACTORS AS WE CAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THE WORLD AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW WILL NEED ALL OF THEIR SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH. UP AND MAKE THE BEST CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES. WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN GO TO WORK OR KEEP A JOB UP BECAUSE THEY'RE UNSURE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN. A SO THIS IS THE KIND OF REALLY IMPORTANT WORK. THAT WE NEED. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE INCREASED THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH HAS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SLOTS A AND AGAIN I KNOW WE'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR BUT WE JUST HAD A RESPECT. UP TO THE COMMITTEE AND OUT OF RESPECT TO THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN IN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO WERE ARE HER WAITING FOR THIS. AND THAT WERE ABLE TO REINVEST IT IN CALIFORNIA AT THE GROUND LEVEL AS WE CONTINUE TO RAISE THE WHOLE STATE THING OKAY MARKETING GAUGE IF YOU REAL QUICK. PERSON REMEMBER LIMON. THANK YOU I A N. THINK BOTH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OVER A DOZEN. BIPARTISAN WOMEN IN BOTH HOUSES MEMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR DECADES AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S BRAND NEW AND I THINK THAT IT IS ABOUT AN INVESTMENT THE WORD INVESTMENT. WAS USED ON AND WE KNOW THAT EARLY INVESTMENT YIELDS LONG TERM RESULTS FOR STUDENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR BRINGING IT UP AND I HOPE THAT TODAY'S CONVERSATION WE ECHO THAT THIS IS. A VERY IMPORTANT. FOR A BODY OF INDIVIDUALS HERE AS THERE ARE FOR MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO SUPPORT THIS I'M BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE LOST ON US OUT THAT WE ARE AT THIS. EVERY SINGLE YEAR ASKING. AND AND NOT WE DON'T GET THE ASKS. ANY OF THE YEARS ON AND WE HOPE THAT THIS ASK. IS SOMETHING THAT WILL GET US TO A LONG TERM GOAL AND THAT YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS THAT WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT WILLTAKE TO MAKE THE NEEDED. LONG TERM INVESTMENT. YES I DID BUT YES SIR MISTER VOEPEL. THIS IS A FRIENDLY RESPECTFUL QUESTION. BUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR BABIES RAIMES AND IT'S VERY NICE OKAY I GET IT. HOW COME A BILLION? WHAT ABOUT A HALF A BILLION? WHAT NUMBER? WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. THE THE BUDGET OVER OVER TIME HAS TO AS WE WENT INTO THE RECESSION THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WAS REDUCED. I'VE. AND WE OFTEN SAY THAT THAT. BUDGETS ARE A REFLECTION OF OF VALUES AND THIS WILL OPEN AGAIN WHEN THERE WAS NO MONEY WE'RE CUTTING POLICE EVERYBODY ELSE. CHILDCARE WAS WAS CUT DOWN TO TO LONELINESS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO THOSE NUMBERS AT THIS WILL GET US THERE AND THEN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA INVESTMENT. A SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE MOON WERE ASKING FOR WHAT WAS LOST AND WITH THE COST OF LIVING WHAT CONTINUES TO RISE. AND AS YOU KNOW WE WERE WHEN WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE IT ALSO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS. WE JUST KNOW THERE ARE THE BACKLOG WE ALL HAD CHILDREN. UP IN OUR OFFICES LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SLOTS FOR CHILDCARE AND AGAIN WE'RE ASKING MORE MORE PEOPLE TO GO OUT TO WORK. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE SO A BILLION A BILLION WILL JUST COVER THOSE COSTS AND BE ABLE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA FOR INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD TO KNOW. THANK YOU AND AND I WANT TO ALLUDE TO THAT AND ASK A QUESTION AS WELL AT THE FIRST IS ON SOMETIMES GET REPORTS FROM DEPARTMENT FINDS THAT THAT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EASY LAST YEAR'S OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. THOSE ARE FOR THINGS LIKE RATES AND SLOTS BUT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE THE UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT DURING THE RECESSION. CUT SO MUCH OF ACCESO THAT BILLION DOLLAR CUT DOESN'T EQUAL THE MONEY WE'VE BEEN PUTTING BACK ON OF THE. UNDER THE ON THE THE EQUATION HERE A LARGE PART BECAUSE COST INCREASES AND SO FORTH SO. SO THIS REQUEST WOULD. WOULD ROUGHLY GET US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE WHICH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE. ELIGIBLE AND. YOU KNOW THAT THAT NEED TO TO HELP YOU KNOW. MAHMOUD FAMILY MEMBER GET BACK TO WORK AND ALSO MAKE SURE THE YOUNGSTER HOUSES HAS A CHANCE FOR A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE SO I'M WERE IN. FULL ACCORD YEAR EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS WE WANT TO DOUBLE DOWN. THIS YEAR MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT I KNOW I HAVE NINE YEAR OLDS AND THERE MIGHT BE THESE AND YOU HAVE A I THINK IN NINE OR TEN ON YOUR SEIZE YOUR BABY TOO. SO WHAT WE CONSIDER BABIES ARE RECONSIDERING UP TO ZERO THROUGH FIVE ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING AT JUST INCIDENT TALLER BECAUSE WORD AT THE COMMITTEE LOOKING AT ALL THOSE ISSUES FROM. FROM FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH OUR STATE A PREPAID PROGRAMS AS WELL AS IMPOTENT TALLER ACCESS AND STATE CHILDCARE PROGRAM WE PRIMARILY WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THIS IS FROM ZERO TO THREE YEARS OLD. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY GOES LONGER THAN THAT BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF OUR INFANTS WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE THEM MANY PRESCHOOLS WILL NOT TAKE A CHILD THAT HAS NOT BEEN POTTY TRAINED. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE GET THOSE CHILDREN IN A REALLY RELIABLE. OF SETTING AND. I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT. I KNOW I'M A GRANDMOTHER AND MY DAUGHTER CAN'T FIND A CURE. SHE LIVES IN LOS ANGELES. CALLS ME IN TEARS AND TO SIGN UP FOR DAYCARE IT'S. TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS HER REGISTRATION AND AFTER SHE'S FILLED OUT THE FORM THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPENINGS. SO IT'S BECOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO FIND ANY KIND OF DAYCARE. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD. NOT PREVENT A FAMILY FROM BEING WHOLE AND MAKING SURE WE GET THESE KIDS IN A RELIABLE CALLED. EDUCATION. SETTING SURE SO THAT YES THIS IS FOR THE. FOR FOR PROBE BEFORE THEY START SCHOOL BASICALLY AND THEN THERE'S ALSO OF COURSE ASKS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND YEAH. WE'RE GETTING THERE AND AND ONE THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO ON TO LOOK AT TO. IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS OF COURSE IS JUST FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES BUT YOU CAN ALL OF OUR DISTRICT YOU COULD BE. MAKING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY LET'S SAY A CAREER FOR AND BY NO MEANS ARE YOU WEALTHY BY KNOWN BY NO MEANS CAN YOU AFFORD AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE NOT. POOR ENOUGH TO AFFORD. THE TEASER A PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER AND SO. THERE'S THERE'S THIS MISSING MIDDLE PIECE OF ELIGIBILITY IS THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDRESSING ESPECIALLY IN OUR STATE PRESCHOOL ELIGIBILITY. THINGS UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR POP PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY THIS IS THAT. THE TOP THE LIST FOR OUR FINAL ACTION THANK YOU VERY MAKES YOU VERY LINK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORE TALK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. AND. WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED AUGMENTATION TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. WE THINK THAT. CERTAINLY THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. AND THE DIALOGUE THAT WE HEARD A FEW MINUTES AGO BETWEEN THE LA WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE I THINK EXEMPLIFIES THE FACT THAT. THE TIMING OF THIS. PROGRAM. IS SUCH THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY THE NUMBERS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO TRUE UP IN MAY. WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE? TREASURER'S OFFICE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT THE NUMBERS. GOING FORWARD AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE THINK THIS IDEA OF CHEWING UP EVERY MAY IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO SO WE ACTUALLY DO GET THE RIGHT NUMBER. WE DO ALSO HOWEVER AGREE WITH ALL OF THE LA NO ABOUT. THEY MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. IN TERMS OF ACCIDENT COST THAT MIGHT COME UP IN THAT ONE I WAS EXPECTED AND WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROPOSAL THAT WE SUPPORT FROM THE LA OUT THANK YOU.

TO INCLUDE ARM SNC DOLLARS AS APPROPRIATE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HI DENNIE MICHELETTI CULVER REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION. WE SUPPORT THE EAST E. COALITION ARE PROUD MEMBER AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WE'D LIKE TO COME JUST RESPOND TO A QUESTION THAT YOU HAD ABOUT WHY THE ONE BILLION FOR BABIES. SO THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER NOTED THAT THERE WAS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION INCOME ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. THAT DON'T HAVE A SLOT TO GO. WHEN THE ELIGIBILITY LIST WERE DISMANTLED IN ROUGHLY TWENTY TEN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS JUST SHY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. CHILDREN NEEDING A SLOT THOSE NUMBERS ARE MEMBERS THINK A COMING IN AROUND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND. I AM. CURRENTLY IN THE THE. ALTERNATE PAPER PROGRAMS THERE'S FEWER THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND SLOTS FOR THE WORKING POOR. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT NEED THE OFF OUR WEEKEND CARE THE BILLION FOR BABIES WILL FUND ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SLOTS. SO IT MOVES FORWARD TO MAKING AN INNER OF BUT NO WHERE NEAR MEETING THE NEEDS. I'M WE SUPPORT THAT GOVERNOR CONTINUING TO FUND THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR PROVIDERS SO THAT WHEN RATES WERE BROUGHT UP. NO PROVIDER RATES WERE GOING TO BE REDUCED AND THEN FINALLY WEEKS WE SUPPORT. ONE TIME MONIES BEING USED FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES AND CONNECT THEM WITH. OTHER SUPPORTS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CITIES ALLEN DRAVID'S WOULD ASSN PROJECT CALIFORNIA. OF PART IF THE EASY COALITION AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SEQUEL EASY COALITIONS AND LET'S ITEMS CAUCUS PROPOSAL FOR BILLION DOLLAR FOR BABIES.

AND I THINK I MET TIONNE AARON THERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU IN UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS ASKED ME. ASSEMBLYMAN VOEPEL POINT MONEY TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION ALSO ABOUT WHY BILLION. I'M DURING THE RECESSION WE LOST A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SLOTS. BY THIS TIME WE MAYBE HAVE REPLACED AROUND FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM. RIGHT THE IS HE COALITION THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS RIGH IN OUR PROPOSALS OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES WE WANTED TO DEAL WITH WAS RATES. WHICH WE PULL LEGISLATURE WAS WONDERFUL ABOUT RIGHT IN CHINA INCREASING RATES NOT ENOUGH TO OBVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO IT INTEREST ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GO INTO THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FIELD. BUT AT LEAST WE'RE BEGINNING TO TO BILL BE ABLE TO BUILD BACK UP RIGHT. BUT THERE WAS A STUDY DONE OF A BRAND STORY DONE AND I DON'T CAN'T REMEMBER IF THAT'S COMMITTEE WAS PART OF THAT HEARING. WHERE THE BRAND PEOPLE CAME IN TO TALK ABOUT A NATIONAL STUDY THAT THEY FOUND THAT WE NEEDED AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH ELIGIBLE FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY? IF YOU JUST PRESUME CALIFORNIA'S TEN TEN PERCENT THAT MEANS THAT IN ORDER TO FULLY FUND ELIGIBLE CHILDREN IN THE STATE WE WOULD NEED AROUND FOURTEEN BILLION. CURRENTLY THE EARLY CHILDHOOD AND COMMIT THE BLUE RIBBON I THANK YOU CAT LIKE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHERE WE HAD HEARD THAT. WHICH WHICH GROUP OF WHEN I AM NOT IT WAS ONE POINT FOR THEM TO GO WE CAN DO THAT NOT THAT I KNOW YOU NEVER YOU MISSPOKE GIVEN WORK FOURTEEN MILLION. CURRENTLY WE PUT WE HAVE AROUND A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR ELIGIBLE FAMILY SO WE ARE MISSING AND AROUND TEN. I'M OF THE IDEA HERE IS OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT A BILLION DOLLARS WOULD TAKE A SAKE YOU HEARD NUMBERS WISE WITH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT PARTICULAR AROUND INFANTS AND TODDLERS. AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS RIGHT THIS MOMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT MIGHT CHANGE OVER THE YEARS. RIGHT AND AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE CAN EVERY YEAR TO LOOK AT WHAT WHERE THE PRIORITIES BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE AROUND INFANTS AND TODDLERS. SO AS HE ARE YOU IN AND ASKED ME ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN WE ARE PART OF THE EASY COALITION. THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU MISTER ABOUT.
