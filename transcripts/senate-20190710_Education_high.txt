HAVE TWENTY FIVE BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA WE HAVE FIVE ITEMS ON CONSENT. ITEM FOR AB ONE TWENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. ITEM TWENTY FOUR AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBR CARILLO HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. WE'RE EXPECTING A VERY LONG HEARING TODAY SO WE WILL LIMIT TESTIMONY TO TWO PEOPLE PER SIDE TWO MINUTES EACH. WITNESSES THAT EXCEED TWO MINUTES WILL CAUSE THE NEXT TWO WITNESSES TO HAVE LESS TIME SO PLEASE DO NOT EXCEED YOUR ALLOTTED TIME ALL OTHER WITNESSES WILL STATE THEIR NAME AND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION ONLY PLEASE. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING WITH -- ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AND BEFORE I GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL I JUST WANTED. TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS THE OPPOSITION THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. HAVE PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK INTO THIS BILL SO WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME AND EFFORT BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHORS RECENT AMENDMENTS OR THE MAKINGS OF A DEAL WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MY SENSE IS THAT FOLKS ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. THAT THE REMAINING ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED OVER THE SUMMER THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR TO DATE INCLUDE. EXTENDING THE TIMELINE FOR CHARTER PETITION REVIEW AND APPROVAL AND ENSURING THAT CHARTER PETITION HEARINGS INCORPORATE ALL IT INPUT FROM ALL SIDES. ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DENY CHARTER PETITIONS THAT DUPLICATE PROGRAMS ALREADY OFFERED WOULD UNDERMINE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OR WOULD HARM THE DISTRICT FINANCIALLY. PROHIBITING EIGHT CHARTER PETITION FROM BEING AMENDED THROUGHOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS AND LIMITING THE STATE BOARDS ROLE. CLARIFYING THE CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS OF CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS CREATING ACADEMICALLY FOCUSED CHARTER RENEWAL CRITERIA. PLACING A TWO YEAR MORATORIUM ON NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. I AM NOT ASKING FOR THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ANY COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT MOVING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT BACKGROUND AND PERSPECTIVE IN MIND I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK YOUR STAFF. MY STAFF FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS WORK AND LET'S GET STARTED THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR OUTLINING WHAT IS -- VERY NECESSARY CONVERSATION. AND AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE REFORMS THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION OVERSIGHT. APPEALS IN RENEWAL PROCESS SEES. THE LANGUAGE IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL REFLECTS ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THERE ARE PIECES IN THE BILL THAT ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THERE WILL BE CHANGES AS YOU HAVE OUTLINED -- WITH YOUR INTRODUCTION MANAGER WE ARE ALL AWARE THE CHARTER REFORM IS A TOPIC OF MUCH DISCUSSION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL JUST LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER. IN FACT THERE ARE MANY MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT THE NEED TO REFORM THE CURRENT PROCESS NOT TO ELIMINATE IT. OKAY BUT TO REFORM ACT. THIS OF ANYONE TODAY SAYS WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO SHUT DOWN ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT. WHAT THIS BILL DOES -- RECENT ARTICLES IN AGAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WHERE WHERE WHERE OF THOSE -- DOCUMENT THE REASONS OR WHY IT IS TIME TO REFORM THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAWS IN FACT SAN DIEGO RECENTLY HAD ELEVEN PEOPLE. INDICTED FOR SOME NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES APPARENTLY. THE SUPERINTENDENT'S CHARTER TASK FORCE CONCURS THAT REFORMS CONSISTENT WITH THIS BILL ARE NEEDED. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THOSE SEEKING TO OPEN A CHARTER SCHOOL TO GO AUTHORIZE OR SHOPPING. SIMPLY PUT THIS MEANS THAT AFTER BEING REJECTED BY ONE BOARD THEY CAN GO SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER BOARD FOR APPROVAL. WHY IS AUTHORIZED YOUR SHOPPING A PROBLEM? THE DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER IS LOCATED NOT ONLY LOSES THEIR STUDENTS TO A SCHOOL THEY DID NOT BELIEVE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS BUT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FACILITIES OR OTHERWISE ACCOMMODATE. THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND PROVIDE SOME -- SOME OVERSIGHT THE FACT IN THE LA TIMES THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ABOUT SCHOOLS SHARING. SPACE AND HOW THAT CAN BE A REAL STRUGGLE IS PUSHING POLLS -- WITH REGARD TO THAT. A FURTHER THIS OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE CHARTER THAT IS BY AN ENTITY THAT IS NOT LOCATED IN A DISTRICT IN FACT MAYBE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. PROVIDES A LACK OF OVERSIGHT AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IF YOU CAN YOU CAN READ THE NEWSPAPER YOU SEE ARTICLES WERE CHARTER AUTHOR RISERS NINE HUNDRED MILES AWAY AND COULDN'T PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT. SO WE WE CERTAINLY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT FACT IN SAN DIEGO IT WAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT ON THE ASSEMBLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY STUDENTS. YET IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BECAUSE IT'D AUTHORIZED SO MANY SO MANY CHARTER OPERATIONS THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE OVERSIGHT WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT NECESSARY. INFRASTRUCTURE SO COMMUNITY IMPACT. LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND ADMINISTRATORS NO THERE DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS BEST AND SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH CHARTERS ARE BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THIS BILL GIVES DISTRICTS GREATER FLEXIBILITY CONSIDER HOW NEW CHARTER SCHOOL WILL IMPACT THE COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS. WE MUST ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICT TO CONSIDER THE FISCAL IMPACT OF A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY HAVE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD. PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND ONCE CHARTERS ARE APPROVED THE BILL ALLOWS AUTHORIZES TO CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL DURING RENEWAL. THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED HER TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO FISK TO A PHYSICAL PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES AN EMERGENCY SO LET'S ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS UP FRONT. AND LET'S ADDRESS SOME SOON SO THEY DON'T REALLY BECOME A PROBLEM AND THAT THAT CHARTER WILL BE AUTHORIZED RE AUTHORIZED. WHEN THE CHARTER CERTAINLY CLOSES ORDERED OR SHUT DOWN IT IS DEVASTATING FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES? AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST PICK UP THE PIECES TO MAKE SURE THOSE STUDENTS ARE EDUCATED OFTEN. IN A DAY'S NOTICE LAST YEAR IN FACT IN SACRAMENTO. A CRISIS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE DISTRICT HAD LOCAL CONTROL. THURMOND COLLEGIATE ACADEMY. WAS INITIALLY DENIED BY SAN JUAN UNIFIED AND DENIED AGAIN BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. DUE TO POTENTIAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THE SCHOOL WAS APPROVED THEN. BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE OF THAT APPEAL ONE ALL THE WAY UP AND THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THAT CHARTER. PARENTS WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE SCHOOL WAS CLOSING ON THE DAY IT CLOSED DUE TO FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. THIS SCHOOL CLOSURE LOVE STUDENTS STRANDED AND IT COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THIS SCHOOL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN APPROVED ON APPEAL UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY MORE STORIES LIKE THIS. SO THE APPEAL PROCESS. THIS BILL REFORM THE APPEAL PROCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THE SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WILL NOT OCCUR AGAIN. THIS BILL GIVES CHARTER AUTHORIZES THE TOOLS TO HOLD CHARTER SCHOOLS MORE ACCOUNTABLE. BY SHORTENING THE RENEWAL FEARED FOR STRUGGLING SCHOOLS. TO ENSURE THE CHARTERS CHARTER TEACHERS ARE QUALIFIED THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS. MUST HOLD THE RECORD CREDENTIAL FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENT ALLOWING CHARTERS TO HER UNTRAINED TEACHERS WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK CAN ONLY LEAD TO BAD THINGS IN FACT WE NOW HAVE A SITUATION -- APPARENTLY OUR STATE WHERE CHARTER SCHOOLS OF HIRED AND AND AND CREDENTIAL TEACHERS AND THIS MEANS THEY MAY NOT HAVE AYE BACKGROUND CHECKS. THEY COULD HAVE. BEEN INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WITH CHILDREN IN THE PAST IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY BACKGROUND CHECK NOR TRAINING. TO TO TO TEACH. OF THE LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE ON TEACHER QUALIFICATION IMPRINT DOES NOT REPRESENT MIND AND IN THIS PIECE THE BILL WILL CHANGE BUT LET ME BE CLEAR MY INTENT IS TO HAVE A ALL CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS. HAVE THE CREDENTIAL REQUIRED FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENT WITH A FULL BACKGROUND CHECKS AS WE WOULD FOR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL. SIMILARLY THE NATURE OF THE COUNTY APPEAL PROCESS AND THE APPROPRIATE ACADEMIC ACCOUNTABILITY STUDENT SCANNERS ARE SUBJECT OF ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT OF AND REYES WITH THIS BILL. CLOSE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS NO THIS BILL WILL NOT SHUT DOWN EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS BILL WON'T AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE ANY SCHOOL. THIS BILL GRANDFATHERS ALL EXISTING CHARTERS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THERE ARE TWENTY NINE CHARTERS AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT WILL NEED TO RETURN TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS WILL RETURN OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. ANOTHER QUESTION WILL THIS BILL ARE DISTRICTS TO CLOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS AT RENEWAL FORD FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON THE RICH WOULD IT. CAN THEY DENY RENEWAL A TRY BECAUSE I GUESS A WELCOME HARM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO FINANCIAL STATUS THE ANSWER IS NO. SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN'T CONSIDER THE FISCAL IMPACT DURING THE REVIEW OF A PETITION FOR ONLY A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL BUT NOT FOR EXISTING. CHARTER SCHOOLS. OKAY ANOTHER QUESTION HOW TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S TASK FORCE ON FISCAL IMPACT AND CHARTER AUTHORIZING IMPACT THIS BILL INFORMED THIS BILL. I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR CLEARLY SIGNALING THAT MORE CHARTER REFORMS ARE NEEDED. THIS AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. REPRESENTS THE INCLUSION OF MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TASK FORCE REPORT. DESPITE HOW SOME MIGHT CHARACTERIZE THE TASK FORCE THE LEGISLATURE IS A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. AND WE SHOULD DETERMINE OUR OWN PRIORS BUT AGAIN MOST OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INCORPORATED IN THE BILL. THERE'S SOME OTHER QUESTIONS I'VE HEARD -- JUST OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGAIN. BEN ALL BUT SOME THERE'S SOME ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS THEY MAINLY SERVE CONSERVATION CORPS STUDENTS AND SOME OTHER STUDENTS SCI TECH IS ONE OF THEM. ARE WITH US A BILL AFFECT THOSE SCHOOLS THE ANSWER IS NO. THE BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THE LANGUAGE THAT APPLIES TO SCHOOLS LIKE SCI TECH AND THE CONVERSE CONSERVATION CORPS. OUR INTENT HAS NEVER BEEN TO IMPACT THESE TYPE OF SCHOOLS WHICH IS WHY THE BILL DOESN'T AMEND THAT CODE SECTION AT ALL. FURTHER THE LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES -- FOR SCHOOLS LIKE SCI TECH OR THE CUT THOSE SCHOOLS MAINLY SIR CONSERVATION. CORPS -- MEMBERS -- BUT IT PROVIDES A WITH THE FLEXIBILITY ON WHERE TO LOCATE -- STATES THAT THEY MAY OPERATE -- DESPITE WHAT ANY OTHER LAW DICTATES DICTATES -- ANOTHER QUESTION -- WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE APPEAL PROCESS -- ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE A FOOL APPEAL TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION UNDER THIS BILL. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE WE ARE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. FURTHER THE BILL LIMITS THE APPEAL AT THE STATE BOARD LEVEL SO THAT. THE STATE WILL ONLY HEAR APPEALS AND DEMONSTRATE THE IN IT THAT DEMONSTRATE THE DISTRICT OR THE COUNTY. OR THE COUNTY ABUSE ITS DISCRETION -- WITH THIS BILL CLOSE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS NO. ALL THIS BILL GRANDFATHERS IN ALL EXISTING CHARTERS. BETTER AUTHORIZED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE COUNTY ALSO THE EDUCATION THERE ARE TWENTY NINE CHARTERS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT WILL NEED TO RETURN TO THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT IT DOES NOT. SHUT THEM DOWN -- LET'S SEE -- WILL THIS WILL THIS WILL THIS ALLOWED DISTRICTS TO CLOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS AT RENEWAL FOR DISTRICT -- OR COMMUNITY IMPACT THE ANSWER IS NO [inaudible] NOW -- AND I'LL JUST KIND OF LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE I DO HAVE A MISTER BONTA IS HERE -- I DON'T WITH THE CHAIRS RIGHT NOW MISTER CHAIR MISTER BOND IS HERE TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL AS WELL AS A COUPLE WITNESSES SO I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. SORRY TO CRAZY DAY -- BEFORE WE GO DO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IDEA NOTICE A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LEYVA. LEYVA HERE WILL PRESENT. WILL CARE CHIANG LASSELL. WRESTLE HERE GLAZER GLAZER HERE MCGUIRE PAN. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AS A JOINT AUTHORS ALSO PRESENT ON AB. FIFTEEN OH FIVE TODAY. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT HAS LARGELY BEEN ON TOUCH SINCE IT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO CALIFORNIA NOW FINDS ITSELF FAR REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL MISSION AND VISION OF THE ACT WHICH WAS IN PART MEANT TO HELP GENERATE. INNOVATION TO BENEFIT STUDENTS IN ALL SCHOOLS BUT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THE GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS A STUDLEY DRAIN MONEY AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS A RESULT. NUMBER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING. SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES INCLUDING MY OWN IN MY DISTRICT THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. WITH NEARLY 30% OF STUDENTS ATTENDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OPEN UNIFIED FACED A FISCAL SHORTFALL OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. OTHER DISTRICTS LIKE SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA IN INGLEWOOD ALSO FACE SIMILAR FISCAL PRESSURES. THESE DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE A LARGE CHARTER SCHOOL PRESENCE. SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARDS ARE MAKING CUTS AND STAFFING IN FACILITIES AS STUDENT ENROLLMENT DECLINES BUT MANY DISTRICTS. ARE AT THE BREAKING POINT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO ENSURE THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THEIR DISTRICT. THE STUDENTS FUNDAMENTAL. MANY OF US HAVE SERVED ON OTHER BOARDS -- BEFORE WE CAME HERE AND WE KNOW THAT FINANCIAL HEALTH IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT -- OUT COMES WE CAN HELP ENSURE AND FOR A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER TO BE WILLFULLY BLINDED. AND UNABLE TO ATTEND TO THAT DUTY -- SEEMS AWKWARD AT BEST AB FIFTY NO FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO CONSIDER HOW THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL COULD IMPACT. A DISTRICTS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS OR FISCAL HEALTH WHEN WAY IN NEW CHARTER APPLICATIONS THIS BILL SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF CHARTER AUTHORIZES TO HOLD CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE WOULD PERMIT THE CONSIDERATION OF A CHARTER SCHOOLS FINANCIAL STABILITY. DURING THE RENEWAL PROCESS SO THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN IDENTIFY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO A PROBLEM. WITH ASSISTANCE BEFORE BECOMES AN EMERGENCY. MOREOVER SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED PARTNERS IN INNOVATION NOT DUPLICATION OR REDUNDANCY ALONG WITH THE GOALS OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ACT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE MEANT TO GENERATE INNOVATION. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CHARTERS IN THE PETITION TO DESCRIBE WHY THEY'RE PROPOSED MODEL COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN THE EXISTING TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL STRUCTURE. LASTLY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS ARE ELECTED BY AND ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ENTRUSTED TO MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF THE STUDENTS LIVING WITHIN THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES A. B.. FIFTEEN OH FIVE SIX TO ENSURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE AUTHORIZED AND OVERSEEN BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THAT BEST UNDERSTAND THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. OF THE LOCAL STUDENTS AB FIFTY TO FIVE IN SOME WILL CREATE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A STRONGER EMPHASIS ON EMPOWERING LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. FIFTY NO FIVE I APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS AND YOUR STAFF'S. WORK ON THIS BILL IT IS AN ONGOING WORK IN PROGRESS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO HAVE PLEASE BE PART OF THIS QUESTION TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER BONTA WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT CITY MARTIN FROM SAN DEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN -- DANA DEAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY LADIES. THANK YOU CHAIR WOMAN LEYVA AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SUPERINTENDENTS ANDY MARTIN OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE STATE'S SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT REPRESENTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE EVERY DAY. INCLUDING TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE BECAUSE IT EMBODIES THE PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL CONTROL WHICH HAS BEEN THE KEY TO CALIFORNIA SCHOOL REFORM AND THE STRIDES THAT WE HAVE MADE AS A DISTRICT. SAN DIEGO WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE ONLY BIG CITY DISTRICT IN THE NATION WITH OUTSTANDING TEST SCORE GROWTH AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE BEATING THE ODDS AND OUTPERFORMING THEIR PEERS IN SAN DIEGO ACCORDING TO THE RECENT STUDY CO AUTHORED. BY THE ESTEEM DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND THAT IS BECAUSE SCHOOL REFORM HAS GIVEN US THE POWER TO MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE. CONSISTENT WITH AN EXPANDING ON EFFORTS TO RESTORE LOCAL CONTROL AB FIFTY NO FIVE IMPORTANTLY ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER THE FISCAL IMPACT THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE ON SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS TO HAS HAD TO BALANCE A ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET EVERY YEAR I CAN TELL YOU THIS MATTERS A LOT ONE STUDY SHOWS THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS HAVE LOST MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS IN JUST FOUR DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE THE DRAIN OF THESE CRITICAL RESOURCES CANNOT BE IGNORED AND DISTRICTS MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER WHETHER A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD DENY SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXISTING SCHOOLS. EXISTING CHARTERS AN EXISTING DISTRICT MANAGED SCHOOLS I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COUNTY APPEALS PROCESS IN AB. FIFTEEN OH FIVE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS OVERLY BROAD AND UNDERMINES THE PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL MOVING ACCOUNTABILITY FURTHER AWAY FROM THE PARENTS AND THE STUDENTS. COUNTIES SHOULD ONLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OVERRIDE DECISIONS OF LOCAL AUTHOR RISERS IF THERE'S BEEN A CLEAR ABUSE OF DISCRETION. OVERTURNING LOCALLY ELECTED DECISIONS MAKERS HURTS STUDENTS AND I'M SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO RECENTLY WENT THROUGH THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF DENYING A RENEWAL OF A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY DENIED. BUT OUR DECISION WAS OVERRIDDEN ON APPEAL WHICH LEADS TO MY FINAL POINT THE CHARTER WE WERE FORCED TO SEE CLOSED OPERATED FOR FIVE YEARS PERSISTENTLY FAILING. FOR FIVE YEARS FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE ACADEMIC LIVES OF THE STUDENTS THEIR STUDENTS DON'T GET THOSE YEARS BACK. WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THEM FROM FAILURES OF OUR SYSTEM FOR THAT REASON WE BELIEVE WE NEED THE DISCRETION TO SHORTEN THAT LENGTH AND CHARTER RENEWALS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU YOU ABOUT A MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECONDS. YEAH HE WENT OVER. WELL THAT'S A GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M DINA DEAN AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CSPA TODAY I'M CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY BOARDS OF EDUCATION C. C. B. E. WHICH IS AN ARM OF CSPA. I SIT ON THE SOLANO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION I WAS PREVIOUSLY ON A LOCAL BOARD OF BENICIA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD I HAVE A LONG LIST OF APPRECIATIONS BUT GIVEN THE SHORT TIME I'LL JUST SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. WHO HAS WORKED SO HARD ON THIS I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CSPA HAS LONG WORKED ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU? AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE INCLUSION OF MANY OF OUR LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BODY OF THE OF THE WORK YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THIS BILL AND THINK THESE FRESH AMENDMENTS. LEAD US A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TWO OR THREE THINGS BY ARE PROBABLY. TO THAT -- ARE STILL CONCERNING THE FIRST IS THE WHERE -- COUNTY BOARD DECISION IS APPEAL TO THE STATE BOARD WE HAVE FIFTEEN DAYS TO REVIEW THE ENTIRETY OF THE RECORD -- PUT TOGETHER A MEANINGFUL RESPONSE TO THE PETITION. AND SITE SPECIFICALLY TO THE RECORD THAT'S A HERCULEAN TASK EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR COUNTY BOARDS DON'T. THEY WERE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF OPERATING CHARTER PETITION APPEALS AND YOU'RE ASKING AN ENORMOUS OF NOT YOU BUT THE BILL ASSN ENORMOUS AMOUNT FROM ALL OF US THE SECOND APPLIES TO EVERYONE COMES UP SO REAL QUICK. OKAY SEVEN APPLIES TO EVERYONE WHICH IS ABOUT THE SORT OF AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE IN THE NEW APPELLATE APPEALS LANGUAGE WHICH ALLOWS FOR ACTUALLY REQUIRES A SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND DOESN'T DETAIL OUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK AND THAT'S TRUE AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL AND ALSO AT THE COUNTY BOARD LEVEL. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AND SUPPORT PLEASE.

GOOD MORNING. HI CARLOS MARQUEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION HERE TO REPRESENT OUR OPPOSITION TO AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AS AMENDED ON JULY FIFTH. WE WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR SPONSORS AND THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM FOR MAKING THE IMPROVEMENTS REPRESENTED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. WHILE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS FALL SHORT OF ADDRESSING OUR MOST GRAVE CONCERNS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK GREATER PROTECTIONS FOR OUR FAMILIES. AND THE SCHOOLS THEY SO CHERISH HAS NOT CLOSED AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS OVER THE COMING WEEKS TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. BUT TO BE CLEAR WE FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE GRANTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS BROAD DISCRETION TO DENY NEW CHARTERS ON THE BASIS OF RUNNING A SIMILAR PROGRAM WITH NO REGARD. FOR WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS FAILING KIDS FURTHER ALLOWING CONSIDERATION OF FISCAL IMPACT IN DISTRICTS THAT ARE EXHIBITING NO CHARACTERISTICS OF FISCAL DISTRESS IS INDEFENSIBLE ESPECIALLY IF THOSE DISTRICTS DON'T ALSO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE ON MATT. ACADEMIC NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH BY THE CENTER FOR REINVENTING PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT THE AVERAGE SHARE OF CHARTER SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER ACROSS SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS. WITH REGARD TO TEACHER CREDENTIALING IN CHARTER SCHOOLS CREDENTIALING ASSIGNMENT FLEXIBILITY IS A CORE. PILLAR OF THE CHARTER MODEL. BUT LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU WITH SOME MINOR REFINEMENTS WILL ALLOW OUR SCHOOLS TO PRESERVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR CAR THE PROGRESS MADE HERE. RENEWAL CRITERIA STATE LEVEL APPEALS THE TRANSITION PLAN FOR STATE BOARD AUTHORIZED SCHOOLS AND THE ISSUES RELATED TO DISTRICT DISCRETION THAT I'VE OUTLINED FOR YOU TODAY ARE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE. WHETHER A DEAL IS IN REACH WE KNOW THE PROPONENTS AND ADMINISTRATION ARE COMMITTED TO A RESOLUTION THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING TOWARD THAT GOAL BUT GETTING THE POLICY IN A PLACE THAT IS PROTECTED FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR SCHOOLS IS WHAT WILL GUIDE US ABOVE ALL ELSE [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. I'M CATALANO HALLERAN AND I'M SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND ALSO AS THE PARENT CO FOUNDER OF THE DIXON MONTESSORI CHARTER SCHOOL. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I FOUND AN APPARENT RUN CHARTER SCHOOL IN MY HOMETOWN OF DIXON WHICH IS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. HE QUICKLY BECAME I WAS A FIVE A VOTE FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD AND QUICKLY BECAME THE HIGHEST PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL. THANKS FOR A SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. WHEN SCHOOL CAME UP FOR RENEWAL THE FIRST TIME? OUR AUTHORIZED -- PRESENTED SOME HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE FISCAL ARGUMENT THAT SUNDAY OUR SCHOOL WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINED THE DISTRICT BUDGET AND THEY VOTED FOR ONE TO NON RENEW. A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN THE API SCORES CAME OUT THE DIXON MOSTLY CHARTER SCHOOL WAS A HUNDRED POINTS HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. THE SOMEONE A STORY QUICKLY ACTIVATED THE APPEALS PROCESS BUT THE PROCESS TOOK NEARLY TEN MONTHS THE SCHOOL HAD TO CLOSE BECAUSE IT LOST ITS INITIAL AUTHORIZATION TO OPERATE THAT YEAR. BUT A YEAR LATER UNDER SCHOOL BOARD I'M I'M SORRY UNDERSTATE BOARD RE AUTHORIZATION IT RE OPENED AND TODAY IT REMAINS THE HIGHEST PERFORMING SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. ODDLY I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE OTHER SCHOOLS THE TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT ARE CATCHING UP ACADEMICALLY. TMZ HAS SERVED AS A MOTIVATOR FOR EXCELLENCE AS CHARTER SCHOOLS OFTEN DO. AND I WAS ELECTED TO THE DIXON SCHOOL BOARD IN PART SO THAT I COULD INSURE THAT MY COMMUNITY NEVER USES NEFARIOUS FISCAL ARGUMENTS TO UNDERMINE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE EVER AGAIN. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO FOLLOW SUIT AND VOTE NO ON FIFTEEN OH FIVE EVEN UNDER CURRENT LAW IT'S TOO EASY TO SHUT DOWN HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOLS.

THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING THEN WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE YES. OUR WILL PAY ATTENTION HERE GENTLEMAN. CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THEAUTHORS AND THAT'S REALLY ALL THE PEOPLE OF CALM FOR AND AGAINST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY -- I I KNOW AS THE AS THERE'S BEEN INDICATED THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND SO. I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TAX -- I UNDERSTAND THE THE PROCESS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AN AND SO. IT'S IF IT'S FROM SERVICE FLUID IN THESE THINGS CAN CHANGE BUT I I'M. I'M OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO ABSORB THE YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BILL AND ON PAGE THIRTY TWO IF I COULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION. THE PAGE. THIRTY TWO BEGINNING ON LINE EIGHT THERE'S A WHOLE. STE OF EXAMPLES IN WHICH I GUESS IN THE REVIEW OF A PROPOSED CHARTER. THAT -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN DETERMINED UNDER THESE STANDARDS. THAT IT'S NOT -- APPROPRIATE -- DOES INCLUDE -- ON LINE -- EIGHT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINED EXISTING SERVICES. AND THEN ON LINE -- TWELVE WHETHER WITH DUPLICATED PROGRAM CURRENTLY OFFERED. AND IT GOES ON AND I GUESSONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S REALLY AN OPEN DOOR TO JUST. SAY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A SCHOOL HERE IN THE AREA. THIRTY OFFERING MATH AND ENGLISH SINCE. SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THE REST. SEEMS TO JUST BE AN OPEN DOOR TO JUST TO SAY NOW AND WONDER IF THE ARTIST COULD COMMENT ON THAT. UNDER THE THE EFFORT HERE IS THAT THE IMPACT BE SUBSTANTIAL MEAN IT CAN'T JUST BE A DOLLAR THE FISCAL IMPACT CAN'T JUST BE A DOLLAR. PUT IT THAT IT -- SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINES EXISTING SERVICES ACADEMIC OR PROGRAMMATIC OFFERED OFFERINGS SO AGAIN. THE THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL IS TO BRING BACK LOCAL CONTROL. BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT THAT LANGUAGE DOES GIVE A LOCAL BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE -- WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND AND AND STATUS. THUS THE THE PURPOSE OF THE LANGUAGE. IN THE AREA AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE -- ELEVEN THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH SAID THAT IN LOOKING AT THIS. THIS AUTHORIZATION CRITERIA IT SAID. DODD AND ASK THE QUESTION WITH THE OPTION OF THE NINE A CHARTER SCHOOL BASED ON A SUBJECTIVE -- ASSESSMENT OF THE FISCAL IMPACT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MET WROTE RENDER MOST IF NOT ALL CHARTER PETITIONS DENIABLE [inaudible] I'M SORRY. WHAT'S THE QUESTION. BY POINTING OUT THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE IS A CANADIAN ANALYSIS ON PAGE. ELEVEN LOOKS AT THAT LANGUAGE THAT I JUST REFERENCED. AND SAYS THAT IT'S THAT IT'S SO SUBJECTIVE. IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT IT WOULD IT -- NOT RENDER -- MOST IF NOT ALL CHARTER PETITIONS DENIABLE THAT'S THE CONCLUSION THAT THE THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS HAVE MADE ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE. YES YES I SEE THAT MEAN OFFICER I READ THAT WHEN I REVIEW THE ANALYSIS AND BUT I THINK THAT THE OFFICES RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS BOTH THE OBJECTIVE COMPONENTS AND SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE THE SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT. AND THEY WERE. ARE SOME FOLKS WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULD REMOVE ANY SUBJECTIVE -- DISCRETION FROM -- DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD WHOSE JOB IT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN FAMILIES PARENTING COMMUNITIES IN THEIR DISTRICT. AND IN SOME WAYS THIS IS A COMPROMISE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A HIGHER THRESHOLD OF OF SUBSTANTIAL. UNDERMINING IT'S NOT DE MINIMUS UNDERMINING ITS NOT MINIMAL UNDERMINING IT MUST BE SUBSTANTIAL AND SO IT IT'S ACTUALLY A TRIGGER. A HEIGHTENED TRIGGER IT'S REQUIRED BEFORE I DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE ABOUT -- WHETHER CAN EVEN BE CONSIDERED AND THEN IT'S A FACTOR AMONG MANY FACTORS AND YES IF IF IT'S IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT -- DESTRUCTIVE TERMS THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNDERMINING THEY CAN CONSISTENT WITH THIS LAW -- DECIDE THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO AUTHORIZE A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL REMEMBER THIS IS JUST FOR NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS ONE THAT DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO KIDS ADAM NO ONE'S LEARNING ANYTHING AT THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST YET -- BUT IT IS SO IT'S A PROSPECTIVE GOING FORWARD BASIS -- AND YOU NOTICE SOME FOLKS WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY AUTHORITY OF A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD -- SO THAT'S PART OF THE THE COULD THE COMPROMISE HERE TO HAVE THAT HEIGHTENED TRIGGER OF SUBSTANTIAL UNDERMINING. AND SO I O APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NOT A NEW ONES BUT THE SUBSTANTIAL -- DIRECTION THE BUILD ONLY FOCUS ON NEW CHARTERS AND NOT LOOKING BACK AND I THINK THAT'S A MATERIAL -- FOCUS AND I I ONE OF THE COLLEGES -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT IT WE IN AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE. HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA NOW FACING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL AND I THINK MANY WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- WHEN WENT WHEN WE DIP INTO ANOTHER RECESSION THAT THAT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GROW QUITE QUITE QUITE LARGE [inaudible] AND AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE THEY GO WAY BEYOND THE ISSUE OF CHARTERS -- WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT HERE -- BUT I YOU KNOW ENROLLMENT DECLINES ARE JUST ONE PART OF THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING. AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK AT OF THE SIX MILLION. KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY. HOW MANY SCHOOLS? SCHOOLS A DOES THAT COMPRISE I DO KNOW THAT. THAT THERE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR PERFORMING. SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE AND THAT'S ACROSS THE STATE -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SCHOOLS THAT ARE GETTING TITLE ONE FEDERAL AID BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE SCHOOLS. THAT ARE POOR PERFORMING ACROSS THE STATE AND OF THOSE ONLY THIRTY FOUR CHARTERS. SO WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. POOR PERFORMING AND I GUESS THE THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR RAISING THAT FACT ONE IS IS THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS WHO ARE FEELING PRETTY STRESSED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND ALTERNATIVES AND I THINK THE SOME OF THE WITNESSES OF SPOKEN ABOUT EARLIER WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT LOSING A YEAR OF A CHILD'S LIFE. OR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS. IT SAYS IT'S A BIG DEAL. AND I I KNOW IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE THAT I I DO THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE GROWTH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL. THE CHARTER SCHOOL. COMMUNITY IS A IS AN ELEMENT OF PARENTS. SAYING THAT I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANOTHER YEAR OF MY CHILD'S LIFE. AND HERE WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE FOR PERFORMING SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY IT'S A LOT OF PARENTS PROBABLY. PRETTY WORRIED. AND SO EVEN THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALUE OF LOOKING FORWARD ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL. ISSUE GOING FORWARD [inaudible] I'D. THAT'S A LOT OF PARENTS AND A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION AND TRYING TO FIND SOME ALTERNATIVE. AND SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD THINKING WITH THIS LEGISLATION. IT'S DOING SO IN A WAY THAT AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PRETTY STRESSED OUT SO I GUESS IT'S A POINT OF THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THERE. I DO THINK THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS VERY IMPORTANT AND I AND IF I WERE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND I THINK ABOUT THIS IF I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND I WAS LOSING ENROLLMENT AND WE SEE IT IN OAKLAND I NOW. WE SEE IT IN LOS ANGELES. AND AND WE READ ABOUT IN THE PAPER THE CHOICE IS THE THE SCHOOL BOARDS ARE FACING TODAY AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES AND I THINK IF I WERE THERE. WOULD I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO SAY. THAT SCHOOL THAT HAS LOST HALF ITS ENROLLMENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CLOSE IT AND CONSOLIDATE. THESE ARE VERY TOUGH CHOICES THAT I KNOW THE HARD CHOICES. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH THIS BILL THIS BILL TOUCHES UPON IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICES THAT GO INTO THAT FINANCIAL LIABILITY INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES. IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND PART OF THAT CENTRAL NAY AND PART OF THAT OUR COST INCREASES. RETIREMENT COST INCREASES IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. AND SO I DO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT ISSUE OF FINANCIAL. IMPACT IS A VERY ELUSIVE ONE NOT SO EASY TO PIN DOWN SUBJECT TO A LOT OF SUBJECTIVE. AN ANALYSIS AND ALSO SUBJECT TO A LOT OF A LEADERSHIP CHOICES THAT ARE SCHOOL BOARDS ARE MAKING. I AM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES. OF THE SECOND QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK IS ABOUT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. I DO SEE THAT IN THE IN THE REVIEW OF REASONS FOR REVIEWING CHARTERS. THAT I DON'T SEE A LOT ABOUT -- WHETHER OR NOT. THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF THAT HAVE A COMMUNITY ARE BEING SERVED I'D I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THE AUTHOR OR OTHERS SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE OF ACADEMIC NEED IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ANALYZE THE NEED FOR CHARTERS. BUT CAN YOU SAY THAT THE THE ACADEMIC ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE STILL A POINT OF DISCUSSION. AS WE GO FORWARD. CAN YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE THE POINTS OF FIVE IN KOREA -- ABOUT THAT IN REGARD TO THAT. WHAT'S IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. HOW WOULD YOU? WHEN IT COMES TO RE AUTHORIZATION HOW WOULD YOU JUDGE A H. CHARTERS ACADEMIC STANDING? AND SHOULD A CHARTER THAT AS HIGHER ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND MAYBE ANOTHER. HAVE A MORE REFINED PROCESS AND MAYBE GET A A LONGER TIME THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE CHARTER WOULD BE GRANTED FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT COMES UP FOR REAUTHORIZATION. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME OF THE POINTS FOR DISCUSSION TO BE HAD THERE AS WELL. I'M REALLY I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND I DO THINK THAT WITH EXISTING CHARTERS AND THE RENEWAL PROCESS THAT. AND WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ABOUT. THE HIGH QUALITY CHARTER THAT SHE'S LEADING AND AND HOW WELL IT'S DONE AND THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO FIND DIFFERENTIALS. I MET THE QUICK IT SEEMS LIKE A PART OF THAT THE ESSENCE OF ALL THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS TO TRY TO FIND THE BAD APPLES. THOSE CHARTERS THAT ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB CORRECTLY AND I THINK THAT'S A FAIR AT POINT OF INQUIRY IN AND POINT OF WORK BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS THAT I DON'T WANT -- BAD. PUBLIC CHARTERS -- TO TO BE FEELING OUR KIDS IS THE SAME WAY I DON'T WANT TO HAVE BAD TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILING OUR KIDS SO. THAT I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT POINT EMPHASIS SO WHERE. THERE IS -- FOCUS ON OR LACK OF FOCUS OR NO NEED TO FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY -- CHARTERS THAT OUR DIVERSITY SERVING THE ACADEMIC NEEDS WELL I THINK THAT'S A I'M GLAD TO HEAR THT. YOU'RE TAKING A CAREFUL LOOK AT THAT AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT THE SAME FOR FUTURE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT. NO WE'RE YOU HAVE FAILING SCHOOLS IN A COMMUNITY -- AND WE'RE CHARTER I PROPOSE CHARTERS PROVIDE AT THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES I HOPE THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT. TOO BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THIS LIST OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POOR PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS TO BIG NUMBER -- IDOL I WANT TO GO OUT TO THE POOR PERFORMING CHARTERS. TO BUT YOU KNOW IT IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WE WE DO FIND OURSELVES AND MATT I'M SURE I KNOW I'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME BUT MAYBE A FINAL OBSERVATION. THE NOT A TIME THAT WE SPENT TODAY TALKING ABOUT ONE PART ABOUT OUR OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL PART EARLY IN THIS CASE THE FUTURE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL PART -- IT SO OVERWHELMS THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE SPENT TALKING ABOUT OUR POOR PERFORMING. TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE -- WE SPEND ALMOST NO TIME -- HERE IN THE SENATE -- TALKING ABOUT OUR ENGLISH. SCORESOR ARE MATH SCORES ARE SOCIAL SCIENCE SCORES -- AND WE HAVE. A FAILURE AGAINST FAILURE AGAINST FAILURE ALL ACROSS THE STATE. NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE GREAT TEACHERS AND GREAT ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPERINTENDENTS COOL BOARDS BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND YET WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE AND TODAY. FOCUSED ON ONE LITTLE ELEMENT OF IT. AND SO I THINK THAT OBSERVATIONS ONE I HOPE WE TAKE THE HEART THAT WE DO WE ALL FEEL THIS ISSUE OF OUR STUDENTS EDUCATION HOW WE ADVANCE IT AND HOW WE GO AFTER PLACES WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE AUTHORS. BUT BUT WE WE ALL SHARE I THINK IN THAT -- LACK OF ATTENTION ON THE BROADER FOCUS OF OF FAILURE AND POOR PERFORMANCE AND HELP THAT WE CAN -- COLLECTIVELY AND I SAY TO MYSELF AS TO OTHERS. I TRY TO DO BETTER THIS IS THE IDENTIFYING SOME ISSUE OF CONCERN I GRANT YOU THAT BUT I HOPE THAT. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE MORE IMPORTANT FOCUS. ON A BROADER RANGE OF FAILURES AND AND THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER AND AS I STATED WHEN WE BEGAN THE COMMITTEE ONE BILL WILL NOT FIX EVERYTHING THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CONSIDER GLAZER NEED DIDN'T TAKE. TOO MUCH TIME AT ALL IN FACT OUT MY COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS ALIGN ALIGN WITH YEARS I DID ONE ASSET POINTS TO A COUPLE THINGS JUST FOR CLARIFICATION BASED UPON -- WHAT WAS SAID -- DO YOU PUBLIC. SCHOOL CHARTER EMPLOYEES GET BACKGROUND CHECKS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES -- EXISTING STATUE REQUIRES -- FINGERPRINTING AND BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THERE'S A CROSS REFERENCE TO EXISTING STATUTE. IN -- THE BILL IN PRINT AS AMENDED ON JULY FIFTH ON PAGE TWENTY NINE LINE THIRTY SIX IT'S A CROSS REFERENCE. TO FOUR FOUR TWO THREE SEVEN BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CURIOUS ABOUT THE EXAMPLES THAT THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE HAS SURFACED AND VIGILANT ABOUT ANY EXAMPLES IN VIOLATION OF EXISTING LAW. A GREAT THANK YOU ANOTHER THING THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS A LACK OF CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND NAM MY UNDERSTANDING IS COR. CORE SUBJECTS TEACHERS HAVE TO BE CREDENTIALED SO IT'S FOR OTHER THINGS WERE THOSE ARE STEM EDUCATION CAN YOU AND THE COUNCIL ATTY. SO -- AS MISTER O'DONNELL -- INDICATED IN HIS REMARKS THAT THIS ISSUE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO RESOLVE -- AT BECAUSE WE ARE ON POLAR OPPOSITES OF THIS QUESTION AROUND -- WHAT LEVEL OF CERTIFICATE OR CLEARANCE -- CREDENTIALING THAT CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS IN NON CORE AND NON COLLEGE PREP COURSES SHOULD. HAVE TO ABIDE BY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE PILLAR OF THE CHARTER MODEL THAT WE CAN PULL FROM BORROW FROM -- THE TALENTS WITHIN A COMMUNITY OF PROFESSIONALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE MADE IT IT'S THEIR LIFE'S WORK TO BE. A CLASSROOM TEACHER BUT WHO STILL MAY HAVE VALUE. THAT THEY CAN BRING TO THE CLASSROOM THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS PART OF THE SECRET SAUCE OF WHAT MAKES CHARTER SO GREAT AND SO FOR US. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EXISTING SCHOOLS AND FUTURE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT COMPLETELY HOLLOWED OUT. THAT FROM BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE THESE CORE FLEXIBILITY SURROUND CREDENTIALING BUT WE THINK THAT THERE'S A PATH FORWARD THE LANGUAGE IN PRINT BEFORE YOU IS CERTAINLY OUR PREFERENCE WE RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR. HAS HIS PREFERENCE AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK -- TO FIND A LANDING SPOT THERE. I JUST WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT -- UNDER THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THIS BILL OF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAD HAVE YOU KNOW A PHD IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES BUT NOT. A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM TEACHING IN OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS SO I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF IF TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THAT EDUCATION. BUT STILL PROVIDES EXPERTISE. IN MENTOR MAYOR. ON THAT ON THAT TOPIC IN IN. TO TO TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A POINT OF CONTINUED CONVERSATION BUT I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT EVERY TEACHER SHOULD HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A TRAINED TEACHER WHO HAS GONE THROUGH -- AND I DID AND IT THAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO MY BELIEFS -- IN THE BACKGROUND CHECKS I THINK EVEN THERE I THINK WE DON'T AGREE ON WHAT A FULL BACKGROUND CHECK IS I THINK THEY SHOULD GO THROUGH THE FBI CHECK. FOR INSTANCE THEY COME FROM ANOTHER STATE MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SO WE WE NEED WE DO NEED TO FIX THIS. AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR COLLEGE PROFESSOR THAT THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT HISTORY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN. YOU KNOW HOW TO TEACH HISTORY I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WALK INTO A MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM. AS A LONGTIME MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER AND I'VE SEEN THEM FAIL MISERABLY THEY HAD A YOU KNOW A LOT OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. BUT NOT NECESSARILY AN ABILITY TO WORK WITH KILL THERE'S A SPECIAL PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS ON AUG I'LL GIVE YOU THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO SPEAK TO EIGHTH GRADERS. IT AGAIN NON CORE CAN ALSO MEAN SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO WE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IN PARTICULAR. OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THE SICK CALIFORNIA HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ANY TRAINING SCHOOL TEACHER IN THAT ROOM SO I SOME ASSUME WANTED ADVANTAGES TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL HAS OVER TRADITIONAL SCHOOL. IS BECAUSE OF THE WIND FOLLOW ELIMINATION PROVISION FOR SO SOURCES CARRY WERE HAVING A HARD TIME RECRUITING STAND TEACHERS AND AND PEOPLE THOSE VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS WE'VE ALREADY HAD A SUCCESSFUL CAREER. BECAUSE THE SO SECURITY SYSTEM DINGS THEM FOR THAT SO IT'S PROBABLY EASIER FOR YOU GUYS TO RECRUIT THOSE THAT KIND OF TALENT TO YOUR SCHOOL'S CORRECT -- IT YET UNDER EXISTING FLEXIBILITY RIGHT UNDER OKAY. IN MY FINAL THING AND AND THE SURPLUS ALREADY TOUCHED ON IN TERMS OF THEIR SORRY I MEAN CURRY THIS TENSION BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS THE MONEY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IS GONNA BE EXASPERATED. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD A HISTORIC ECONOMIC GROWTH THE GOVERNOR ARNOLD GOVERNESSES SAY IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOREVER DESPITE NOT. AND THEN EVERYBODY HERE THE DICE KNOWS WE HAVE A PENSION BOMB. THAT'S ABOUT TO THE TO GO OFF SO IT SEEMS TO ME IS I'M READING IT THIS IS PRETTY SUBJECTIVE AND I HAVE CONCERNS THAT. EARLY NO CHARTER SCHOOL. WOULD -- B. B. AUTHORIZE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CONCERNED I KNOW L. A. U. S. T. AND I'M I PRAISE AND OUT LIAR THEY JUST SIGNED A CONTRACTOR LATER THISYEAR WITH THEIR TEACHERS THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T TO FILL. IN SO THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING I GUESS TO HEAR WHEN IT WANTING A BAIL OUT BUT I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR VIEWS WERE IN TERMS OF THE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY ASPECT OF THE LEGISLATION. WELL -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS AGAIN A WORK IN PROGRESS -- AND APPLAUD THE THE THE THE GROUND IS ALREADY BEEN LAID TO GET US TO THIS POINT. BUT TERE'S REALLY TWO TYPES OF DISTRICT DISCRETION FOR THE PURPOSES OF FISCAL IMPACT CONSIDERATION IN THE BILL IMPRINT. THERE IS THE TREATMENT FOR DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION AND STATE RECEIVERSHIP. AND ALSO A BROADER UNIVERSE OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE. QUALIFIED BUT WHERE THE OUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IN CONSULTATION WITH THICK MAT HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS ONE CHARTER SCHOOL COULD PUT THAT DISTRICT OVER INTO NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION. AND FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THEY CAN HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF DENIAL WHICH IS A BROADER. DISCRETION THAN ALL OTHER DISTRICTS WOULD ENJOY. BUT OF COURSE THE PETITIONER COULD STILL READ BY THAT WE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PART OF THAT WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THAT. THE SECOND TIER OF DISTRICTS THAT WILL HAVE ANOTHER STANDARD OF DISCRETION IS THIS MULTI FACTORIAL LISTS THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU. AND THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THAT AGAIN THE DISTRICTS CAN SIMPLY DENY A CHARTER SCHOOL BASED ON AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT THE DISTRICT IS RUNNING. AS LONG AS IT'S IN REASONABLE PROXIMITY TO WHERE THE CHARTER IS LOCATED AND SAY WE ALREADY HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT WE'RE GONNA DENY IT. AND WE HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM MIGHT NOT BE SERVING KIDS TO EXCELLENCE THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE HAVE ISSUES WITH IS THAT. LANGUAGE NOW SAYS THAT FISCAL IMPACT CAN ALSO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF DISTRICTS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CHARACTERISTICS AROUND FISCAL DISTRESS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WELL WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE TO BALANCE OUT THAT FACTOR WITH ACADEMIC NEED BEFORE GOING TO EMPHASIZE FISCAL IMPACT IN THE CONTEXT OF DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE FISCAL DISTRESS. THEN WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT THOSE SAME DISTRICTS ARE IN ACADEMIC DISTRESS AND WHERE THEY ARE. I THINK THE CHARTER SCHOOL WE BELIEVE THE CHARTER SCHOOL PETITIONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CASE THAT. THAT VAL YOU IN AND OF ITSELF COULD POTENTIALLY OUT WAY THE OTHER FACTORS AND ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE A STRONGER CASE UPON REVIEW BY THE COUNTY -- SO SO FOR US THE THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH. GREAT I GOT ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE I DO THAT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS. YOU KNOW THIS IS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND I THINK I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO BE TOO WEAK TO TO MAKE IT BETTER SO I I APPLAUD YOU FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS. SO -- WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE PEOPLE OPT IN. AND THEY CAN OPT OUT SO LIKE CENTER CLOSE TO MATCHING THE THE BAD APPLES IF YOU'RE IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL. AS BAD YOU'RE STUCK OR WHEN YOU'RE SCHOOL. PARENTS CAN OPT AMOUNTS SO I THINK YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN MANYRESPECTS BECAUSE THE MARKET PLACE. I'LL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE SO JUST ANY. WRAPAROUND THOUGHTS ON THAT AND THEN I WELL DONE AND I'LL BE I'LL BE BRIEF -- MADAM CHAIR SO THAT -- THEY THEY COUNSELING -- OUT -- ABOUT GUARD RAILS THAT THE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND PLACING HIS TRAILER BILL THIS YEAR. THE BAN ON FOR PROFIT CHARTERS THAT -- WE SUPPORTED THE STRENGTHENING OF STUDENT ADMISSIONS INTO PROCESS RIGHTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT MR BONTA OFF AUTHORED THAT WE ULTIMATELY SUPPORTED -- AT ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT YES WE FACE A FIVE YEAR RENEWAL PERIOD -- AT THE END OF WHICH WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE CLOSER FOR NOT PERFORMING. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF WRITTEN WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HOLD CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE. TODAY AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AROUND THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT THE STATE HAS ADOPTED BEING USED IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT -- BUT IN THE HIGH STAKES ENVIRONMENT OF RENEWAL AND POTENTIAL SCHOOL CLOSURE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT'S THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE PARITY. YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PURSUE AND TERMS OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BUT IT'S A PROBABLY AT SOMETHING WE CAN GET PERFECTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE. IT A COMEDY FOR THOSE HIGH STAKES RENEWALS THE CHARTERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. CENTER DRAWS THEM. YES I I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS IN. THE CHARTER SCHOOL LEADERSHIP -- FOR PUTTING ALL THE ENERGY AND TIME INTO INTO THIS -- YOUR BREAKING GROUND BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BREAKING GROUND TO CATCH UP. TO CATCH UP ON ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DEALT WITH FOR DECADES NOW -- KINDA REMINDS ME OF A IN JUDICIARY WERE TRYING TO TACKLE THE ISSUES OF PRIVACY. IN YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY WHEN IT'S ALREADY OUT THERE. IT'S ALREADY WAY AHEAD OF US AND WE'RE TRYING TO PULL IN AND CREATE SOME RULES WHEN PEOPLE ARE USED TO DOING THINGS. THEIR WAY -- AND I THINK THERE'S WE'VE GOT A CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE SO THAT WE ALL LEARN AND REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. ONE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE BEHAVING. LIKE TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR KIDS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE FISH AND SEA OF OUR TAX DOLLARS. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HAVING STANDARD THAT EVERYBODY COMPLIES WITH THAT EVERYBODY BELIEVES IN. THE STANDARDS ALL OVER THE LOT SO -- I APPLAUD YOU FOR DIGGING IN AND AND TAKING UP. THESE ISSUES -- YOU KNOW ON WHETHER IT'S FINANCIAL IMPACT OR WITH THERE'S PROGRAMS IS -- THESE ARE ALL SPECIFIC -- I DO THINK THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT AND PROGRAM. IMPACT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PIECES OF THIS. THEIR NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MY DISTRICT -- THAT I THINK ARE GOOD AND THEY'RE DOING WELL AND THEY PRESENT SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO OUR COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THE FOUNDERS OF CAMINO LEVEL AND AND A SEMI US I MEAN THESE ARE. THIS IS A GOOD MIX BUT WITHOUT HAVING. A CUP A BELIEF IN THE SAME STANDARDS. THEN IT'S ALL BUT YOU KNOW LOPSIDED IT'S ALL CONFUSING AND YOU'RE RIGHT ON CENTER GLAZER. PARENTS JUST WANT ONE THING OUT ONE OUR KIDS TO HAVE A GOOD PUBLIC EDUCATION I'M NOT SURE BY NOT REQUIRING CERTIFICATION. THAT THAT'S GOING TO GET OUR PARENTS THE BEST PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR THE FOR THEIR KIDS SO -- THERE'S SO MANY OTHER ISSUES I KNOW THAT A WILL BE -- GRAPPLING WITH -- ON THE COLE LOCATIONS UP BUT YOU KNOW IN THE END I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT WE HAVE TO BE COMMITTED TO ONE SINGLE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. PARENTS AND STUDENTS FROM ONE SCHOOL SHOULD NOT BE PITTED AGAINST PARENTS AND STUDENTS OF ANOTHER SCHOOL THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR OUR TIME. DOING -- AND I AGREE THERE ARE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND I'M NOT LIVING UP TO OUR EXPECTATIONS SO LET'S GRAPPLE WITH THAT AND LET'S GRAPPLE WITH IT AS ONE SYSTEM. OUGHT NOT TO SYSTEMS THAT ARE -- THAT ARE COMPETING FOR EACH OTHER SO JUST WAS -- THOUGHTS ALL ALL BE -- SUPPORTING -- HOWEVER I DO THINK THERE'S THOSE KINDS OF CULTURAL CHANGES THAT. NEED TO BE DEALT WITH IN A MUCH MORE HEAD ON WAY SO THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- YEAH I'LL BE BRIEF HERE I THERE ARE OUTSTANDING ISSUES SAID AS WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY AMONG THEM ARE THE THE COUNTY APPEAL PROCESS. ACADEMIC ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR CHARTERS TEACHER CREDENTIALS THAT'S A BIG ONE TO ME YEAH I HAVE TO HAVE A CREDENTIALED TEACHER IN A CLASSROOM -- THE COUNTY CHARTER WIDE PETITION REQUIREMENTS AS WELL -- BUT LET ME JUST JUST JUST BACK UP HERE MAN. IF YOU SEND YOUR CHILD TO A CHARTER SCHOOL AND IT WORKS THROUGH FAMILY CONTINUE DOING THAT. THE EFFORT HERE TODAY IS NOT TO CLOSE ANY CHARTER SCHOOL THE EFFORT HERE TODAY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT.

RIGHT GOOD MORNING NOT MINE IS THE QUOTE UNQUOTE EASY ONE SO LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES. BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS MEASURE. WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW FOR THE AUTHORIZATION OF MORE THAN ONE RESOURCE CENTER IN DISTRICT PROVIDED THE LOCAL AUTHORIZING SCHOOL DISTRICT APPROVES THE EXTRA RESOURCE CENTER IN WRITING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE A ROADMAP FOR ADA AND OTHER FUNDING STABILITY FOR THOSE CHARTERS WILL NEED TO SEEK A NEW CHARTER APPROVAL UPON RE AUTHORIZATION. AS WELL AS CONCERNS REMAINING WITH CHARTERS OPERATING ON TRIBAL LANDS. AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN CONTINUES THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATORS WORK IN INCREASING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY AND ADDING CLARITY TO THE LONGSTANDING CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. THIS BILL INCREASES LOCAL CONTROL BY ELIMINATING LOOPHOLES IN CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT. THIS BILL SPEAKS TO PROPOSAL H. OF THE RECENT CHARTER SCHOOL POLICY TASK FORCE SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE TASK FORCE. THE TASK FORCE REPORT NOTES QUOTE SUCH A PROHIBITION WOULD LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DETRIMENTAL PRACTICE OF USING OVERSIGHT FEES AS A REVENUE STREAM AND QUOTE. THIS BILL RESTORES THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND CLARIFIES THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF DULY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR ROLE IN PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN SEEKS TO ADDRESS CONSISTENT AN ON GOING CHALLENGES THAT LEAVE IMPACTED DISTRICTS WITH NO RECOURSE OTHER THAN COSTLY LITIGATION. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ARE TASKED WITH ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT THAT SUCCESS IS BUILT OFF TRUST FROM THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE AGENCY AND THE COMMUNITY THAT IS IMPACTED BY ITS WORK. TRUST IS BUILT OFF MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT WHICH IS NOT PRACTICABLE IF ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE SCHOOL. IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD. THIS WAS THE CASE DURING MY TENURE ON THE NEW HOMES SCHOOL BOARD. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS NORTH ALREADY TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT O A SCHOOL THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN OUR SCHOOL BOUNDARIES. WE COULD NOT DO ARE DULY ELECTED JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL. NOR COULD WE ADVOCATE FOR ANY MITIGATING FACTORS TO DRINK DECREASE THE IMPACT ON NOT SCHOOLS NEIGHBORS. AS A RECENT CAL MATTERS ARTICLE INDICATES THE CHARTER IN MY DISTRICTS CASE CLOSED IN A FEW SHORT YEARS DUE TO WOEFULLY MISMANAGED FINANCES THROUGH THEIR CMO. AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED BY THE MULTIPLE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WHO WOULD CAREFULLY VETTED AND DENIED THEIR ORIGINAL PETITION. THE AUTHORIZED OR IN THIS CASE WAS A SMALL RURAL DISTRICT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DUE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT. THIS IS OCCURRING IN DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS NOTED NOTED IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS TASK FORCE REPORT IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YEAR. ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE SCHOOLS USED THE EXISTING EXCEPTION OR LOOPHOLE IF YOU WILL. TO OPERATE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZES BOUNDARIES. THE LOOPHOLE IN CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT THAT'S A PAPER FIRST SET OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR STRUGGLING ELLIE ETS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT NOT ONLY WITH THE INTENT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT. BUT WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADEQUATELY FUND ALL DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT. THE COSTS OF OPERATION DO NOT DIMINISH IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO ADA ALLOCATIONS. AB FIFTY NO SEVEN ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT HONORING LOCAL CONTROL ANISHA INSURING THAT DISTRICTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LEGISLATIVELY EMPOWERED TO BEST USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR OUR STATE STUDENTS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ARE GAIL -- BELLINO MOJICA SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS OR UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MARK WINGER MY FOR FORMER SUPERINTENDENT AND THE FOREMAN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEW HALL SCHOOL BOARD. THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY I KNOW YOU YOU HIT ON TWO OF THE THREE TOPICS I HAD THAT YOU WERE GOING TO STILL WORK ON ONE OF THEM ALSO WAS. EXPLORING THE CREATION OF A TRANSITION PROCESS UP FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS CURRENTLY NOT LOCATED WITHIN THEIR AUTHORIZING SCHOOL DISTRICT BOUNDARIES CONSUME CAN SUBMIT THE RENEWAL PATRICIA PETITION. DIRECTLY TO THE DISTRICT IN WHICH THEY'RE LOCATED. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON CORRECT IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT FUNDING STAYS STABLE FOR THEM IN THAT PROCESS PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH ALL YOU DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST THANK YOU. MORNING SENATOR LEVIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM MARK WINGER FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN NEW HALL REJECTED A PETITION FROM THE ALBERT EINSTEIN ACADEMY DUE TO FINDINGS ABOUT THEIR FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS AND THEIR INABILITY TO TEACH OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. OUR THEIR PETITION WAS ALSO REJECTED BY OUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS SAUGUS AND ALSO ON APPEAL FROM LA COUNTY AND BY FOUR OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS INVENTOR AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ACT IN AGUA DULCE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIFTEEN HUNDREDS STUDENT DISTRICT TWENTY MILES IN TWO DISTRICTS AWAY FROM US. WAS NEGATIVELY CERTIFIED BY THE COUNTY. THEY DECIDED TO APPROVED CHARTER SERVING UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS TO RAISE ONE POINT MILLION DOLLARS I HAVE THEIR BOARD PRESENTATION ON THAT RIGHT RIGHT HERE. OF THE DAY THEY APPROVE THAT OF THAT. REMEDY TO THEIR FISCAL PROBLEMS THE EINSTEIN ACADEMY WAS ULTIMATELY APPROVED BY ACT NOT WITH ALL SAY. THEIR PETITION TALKED ABOUT SERVING STUDENTS OF ACT NOT WITH ALL SAY. ABOUT THEIR STUDENT POPULATION REFLECTING THE STUDENT POPULATION OF ACT IN AGUA DULCE. BUT THEN THEY DECLARED THERE WAS NO SPACE AND SO THEY HAD TO OPERATE OUTSIDE IN SANTA CLARITA. THEY FAILED TO FIND SPACE IN SANTA CLARITA IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. AND THEY HURRIEDLY OPENED THEIR OPERATION. IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. IN SCHOOL AN EMPTY SCHOOL IN. ACTON I WOULD ALSO SAY. UP ONE YEAR LATER THEY OPENED A NEW POLICY INTENDED TO DO ALL ALONG TO SEARCH STUDENTS NOT A FACT AND I WOULD ALSO A BIT OF THE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SAND CREEK. WE HAD ONE PETITION IN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF THIS LAW ONE PETITIONS WE DENIED IT ON VERY GOOD GROUNDS AND YET THAT SCHOOL OPERATED IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT -- MISS SMITH MENTIONED SOME OF THIS. INFORMATION AFTER A COUPLE YEARS THEY HAD A FIX MATT EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT FOUND ALL KINDS OF FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT. AND WHILE OUR NON DUPLICATE ACCOUNT WAS 45% NEW HALL THERE'S WAS NEVER HIGHER THAN 5%. SO THE WORD REFLECTING THE STUDENT POPULATION EITHER. WE WERE POWERLESS TO INTERVENE. AND ACTING ON WOULD ALL SAY. DID LITTLE DUE TO THEIR CONFLICTED INTEREST ABOUT WANTING THE SCHOOL TO REMAIN OPEN AS A REVENUE SOURCE AND EVENTUALLY. DUE TO FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT OF THE CMO. THE SCHOOL FAILED IN CLOSED. THIS IS HAPPENED ACROSS THE STATE. WITH A COMMON THEME SMALL FISCALLY DISTRESSED. DISTRICTS EXPLOIT A LOOPHOLE IN MOBILE CURRENT LAW. AB FIFTY NO SEVEN IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING PARENT CHOICE OR CLOSING CHARTER SCHOOLS A REASONABLY GRANDFATHER'S EXISTING CHARTERS. IT IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND IT IS ABOUT ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. ELECTED BOARDS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY -- TO DOESN'T MAKE THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICTS. CURRENT LAW HAS A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS DISTRICTS SOME IN IT FOR THE MONEY YOU'VE USED UP ALL OF YOUR TIME IN OHIO ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES TIME. THANK YOU I'M SORRY THAT'S OKAY I WAIT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OTHER BOARDS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GAIL GARBARINO MO HE GONNA PLASTER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS SCHOOLS IN PLASTER COUNTY THE LOOPHOLE FOR PROVIDING EXCEPTIONS TO THE GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS BEEN EXPLOITED. THIS EXCEPTION IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAW PROMOTES BAD GOVERNANCE AND IT DOES NOT MEET THE IDEALS OF GOOD GOVERNMENTS LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. I HAVE SEVEN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THEIR DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND CAL AND PLASTER COUNTY. WITH THESE CHARTERS I HAVE SEEN INGRESS AND EGRESS ISSUES WITH OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS BEING DROPPED OFF AND PICKED UP EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF WHAT RESULTED IN A DALY MASK BACK MASSIVE BACK UP. ON A FEW OF THE LARGER STREETS AND ROOSEVELT. I HAVE HAD RESIDENTS COMPLAIN TO ME TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND THEN UNDERSTAND HOW A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL LOCATED IN ROSEVILLE WAS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELECTED TO SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF ROOSEVELT. BUT BY A SCHOOL BOARD MILES AWAY. I OF SYMPATHIZE WITH THE RESIDENTS WHEN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW WAS SCHOOL BOARD ELECTED TO SERVE A COMMUNITY MILES AWAY IS SUPPOSED TO COMPARE ABOUT TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN ANOTHER CITY THE ANSWER IS THEY DON'T. I HAVE SEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS SOLICITING SMALLER DISTRICTS TO AUTHORIZE THEIR PETITIONS AND THEN IMMEDIATELY LOCATE THEIR CHARTER SCHOOL OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. I HAVE SEEN TINY TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS AUTHORIZED EIGHT CHARTER SCHOOLS FIVE OF WHICH ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT. THREE OF THE FIVE LOCATED AROUND LAKE TAHOE WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE MILES AWAY IN NINETY MINUTES BY CAR. I HAVE OFTEN EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS LOCATING OUTSIDE OF THEIR DISTRICT BOUNDARIES BECAUSE YOU MONITOR WHAT YOU SEE AND THE SHEER DISTANCE OF TO THAT IS A BARRIER. FOR OVERSIGHT AS THE SAYING GOES OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND. AB FIFTY NINE Q.. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE.

WHAT YOU DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY? IS A SOUND [inaudible] GREAT -- GOOD MORNING SENATORS MY NAME IS LAUREN O'NEIL I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER OF ODYSSEY CHARTER SCHOOL IN PASADENA I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE HOW AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN WHAT IMPACT. A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL WITH TWENTY YEARS F OPERATIONS SERVING STUDENTS PARENTS AND FACULTY. ODYSSEY IS A HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE IN OUR COMMUNITY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH FOR RENEWALS WERE ONE OF THE TOP ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. AND OUR STUDENTS SCORE IN THE TOP 10% OF ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA ODYSSEY WAS APPROVED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF FROM SOUTH PASADEN UNIFIED AT THAT TIME THERE WERE NO LAWS DICTATING WHERE CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD LOCATE AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE FINDING FACILITIES AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES -- CONFRONTING CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT WE FOUND A SUITABLE FACILITY JUST A FEW MILES OUTSIDE OF SOUTH PASADENA UNIFIED AND WE OPENED OUR DOORS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE STUDENTS. FAMILIES AND FACULTIES AND FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW ODYSSEY HAS LAWFULLY LOCATED IN THE PASADENA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT BECAUSE AB FIFTY NO SEVEN HAS NO PROTECTIONS FOR SCHOOLS LIKE OURS ODYSSEY WOULD MOST LIKELY BE FORCED TO CLOSE RESULTING IN THE DISPLACEMENT OF HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS TEACHERS. AND STAFF WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION FOR A LONG TRACK RECORD AND STUDENT SUCCESS UNDER AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN AT THE TIME OF OUR FIFTH RENEWAL OF THE PASADENA UNIFIED DISTRICT DENIED OUR REQUEST FOR APPROVAL. ODYSSEY WOULD BE FORCED TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE AND WE WOULD HAVE NO APPEAL OR OTHER RESOURCE OF THAT DECISION CLOSURE WOULD LIKELY BE BECAUSE FINDING A SUITABLE FACILITY IN SOUTH PASADENA FOR FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS WOULD BE UNLIKELY. AND EVEN IF WE DID IT MIGHT BE TOO FAR FOR A FAMILIES TO ATTEND. AB FIFTY NO SEVEN GOES TOO FAR BY RISKING THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS LIKE ODYSSEY WITH PROVEN TRACK RECORDS OF SUCCESS. THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO ON AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ENSURE PERMANENT GRANDFATHERING PROTECTIONS FOR LIMITED GROUP OF LONG STANDING HIGH I QUALITY SCHOOLS LIKE ODYSSEY. TO REMAIN OPEN AND OUR CURRENT LOCATION THANK YOU OR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING CHAIR LEYVA MEMBERS MY NAME IS LISA COR I'M A PARTNER YOUNG MANY IN COR WE'RE LEGAL COUNSEL TO APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS. I AM ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE WEST LIKE CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE THOMAS I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SEVENS IMPACT ON SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS SERVE OVER. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS STATES WIDE WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR TOTAL ENROLLMENT. MANY OF THEM CHOSE THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS AFTER STRUGGLING IN A TRADITIONAL PROGRAM OR FOR HEALTH REASONS THEY JUST CAN'T ATTEND. ONE STUDENTS OFTEN EXPERIENCE ACADEMIC SUCCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THE PERSONALIZED EDUCATION OFFERED BY THESE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. AB FIFTY NO SEVENS PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE STUDENTS TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES ACROSS COUNTY LINES TO RESEARCH. TO REACH THE RESOURCE CENTERS THE RESOURCE CENTERS IS WHERE LEGALLY REQUIRED SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND ASSESSMENTS ARE PROVIDED SPECIALIZED ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION SPEECH THERAPY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW. IT IS WRONG TO FORCE THESE FAMILIES TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES TO ACCESS SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES OR ASSESSMENTS WHEN YOU DEPART DEPRIVE CHILDREN OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS THE CONSEQUENCES ARE FELT WIDESPREAD. IN THE HOME OUR ECONOMY OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OUR PRISON SYSTEM FURTHER MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO EDUCATE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WITH NON DISABLED PEERS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT APPROPRIATE. THE RESOURCE CENTER IS WHERE THAT INTERACTION OCCURS BENEFITING ALL STUDENTS FINALLY. THIS BILL IGNORES A LARGE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR DISTRICTS WHO WILL HAVE TO RE ABSORBS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ONE RESOURCE CENTERS CLOSE. IMAGINE THE LITIGATION NON PUBLIC SCHOOL ANOTHER COST CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE SAVED SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY OFFERING A NONTRADITIONAL OPTION SCHOOL DISTRICTS JUST DON'T OFFER TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. THIS BILL HAS TOO MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN CHARTERS AND DISTRICTS ALIKE.

SEEING AND HEARING THEM WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. CENTER GLAZER WE DO HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE OF ADAM SHARE AND FOR FOR EVERYONE'S PATIENCE AS WE TALK ABOUT AN IMPORTANT TEST SUBJECT HERE AGAIN THIS MORNING -- AS I READ THAT THE BILL AND AS I READ THE THE ANALYSIS. IT SEEMS THAT THE THE FOCUS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS HIS -- RESTORING THE RIGHT OF ANGEL TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OF THE SCHOOLS IS THE HAS THE ESSENCE OF OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL [inaudible] AND SO IN SOME WAYS THAT THE THE THE THE CRITICISM IS A PROCESS CRITICISM NOT A SUBSTANCE CRITICISM. LIKE GIVE THE DEBATE HERE TODAY WAS ABOUT -- WHERE AN AUTHORIZED -- HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT IN A SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE WERE EXAMINING THAT. I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY OF THAT OF OUR TIME IN THAT EXAMINATION BECAUSE HERE WE ARE. TRYING TO IDENTIFY A FAILURE AND WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS IN THOSE FAMILIES. OF THE BY PRODUCT OF THAT MAY BE WHAT'S BENEFIT OFFICIAL TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR NOT. BUT THE FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE ON THE SCHOOL AND THE KIDS. AND THE PARENTS AND ALL THAT HAPPENS AND ALL THAT HAPPENS THERE. BUT THE COULD BUT THE CRITICISM THAT'S TRYING TO BE OVERCOME WITH THIS BILL IS THE PROCESS FOR HOW. THESE CHARTERS ARE AUTHORIZED -- AND I GUESS THAT'S WHERE I HAVE SOME SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LINES ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT EVERYWHERE I WAS LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES AND LOOKING AT JUST A LITTLE MATH WITH. ALL THE CITIES IN DIFFERENT COLORS AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT THE CITY CITY LINES WE LOOK AT SENATORIAL LINES ASSEMBLY MEMBER LINES IT'S AWFULLY ARBITRARY. I KNOW THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW ARE THAT YOU CAN AUTHORIZE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY SO LEASE WE HAVE SOME BOUNDARIES THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW ARE PUT IN PLACE YOU CAN AUTHORIZE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY. BUT THEN IT IT GETS TO BE A QUESTIONABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE HERE IS IT THE IS IT -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE BLOCKING ANOTHER THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN A LINE DIVIDES THEM. OR IS IT SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL. IF IF THERE WAS CRITICISM THAT WE WERE TRYING TO OVERCOME -- WITH PAY TO PLAY AND HOW AUTHORIZATION IS DONE THAT HAS -- CERTAINLY RESIDENTS WITH ME -- AND IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS FOCUS ON THIS OVERSIGHT AND HOW IT WAS POORLY DONE AND LET'S FOCUS ON THAT AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT BETTER. I I KNOWLEDGE THAT AUTHORIZING ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH AUTHORIZING IT IT'S IT'S VERY COMPLEX. AND IT'S VERY COSTLY AND THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IT AND SOME THAT ARE NOT AND THAT DOES GET IN THE WAY OF THE ABILITY TO AUTHORIZE. A BECAUSE OF THAT -- BUT WITH IT COMES DOWN TO THE ISSUE OF LINES. THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STOPPER FOR ME. IF WE THOUGHT THAT TAX EIGHTY ON THE TESTIMONY THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TODAY AND AND THROUGH CORRESPONDENCE. THAT RAISES SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. THE ABILITY TO GET A CLASSROOM SPACE FOR A CHARTER IS NOT EASY. AND AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE OTHER IN THE EARLIER BILL THAT THERE'S SOME SELF INTEREST OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT -- AUTHORIZING A CHARTER BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN AWAY THEIR MONEY. AND IT MADE ME TAKEN AWAY THEIR CLASSROOM SPACE. AND SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT -- WE COULD CREATE INHERENT CONFLICTS THAT ARE HARD TO OVERCOME -- IF BUT I CHARTER WANTS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN A COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OPPOSED TO IT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP IN A CLASSROOM SPACE WHAT'S THAT CHARTER SUPPOSED TO DO. WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO GO. AND NOW DOES A LINE SEPARATING ONE BLOCK FROM ANOTHER ONE CITY FROM ANOTHER ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM ANOTHER -- IS THAT'S GOING TO BE NOW UNDER THIS BILL THAT THAT CHARTER TO THRIVE AND FIND SPACE. AND WHAT ABOUT THE AT THE AT THE LOCATION NEXT TO TRANSIT LINES. WERE MAKE IT EASIER FOR KIDS TO GET TO SCHOOL. NOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LINE. AND SOME CASES NOT EVEN -- I CITY LINE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE TRANSIT LINE. A BUS OR TRAIN AND THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON TO TRY TO FIND A LOCATION FOR SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT. EASIER FOR KIDS. SO I DO FIND THAT THAT THEY'LL THE ISSUE OF LINES IS SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY. AND I THINK IT IT IT FOR ME AT LEAST IT. IT DIVERTS FROM A FOCUS ON WHAT SHOULD BE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND THAT'S THAT THE QUALITY. OF THE INSTRUCTION -- THE THAT THE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT THAT IS OCCURRING OR NOT OCCURRING IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT. HI AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER PROBLEM OF EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. AND YOU SAY WE'VE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE FOR PERFORMING SCHOOLS. OF WHICH THIS BILL WILL DO NOTHING TO CHANGE. THEN I START THINK WELL IS OUR FOCUS REALLY IN THE RIGHT PLACE. IS IT ON IS IT ABOUT LINES OR IS IT ABOUT -- STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. AND THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TROUBLE UNFORTUNATELY WITH YOUR BILL TODAY IT'S AS I WANT TO FOCUS ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OR LACK THEREOF. AND NOT ON LINES -- THE LAW ITSELF TODAY SAYS IT HAS TO BE WITHIN A COUNTY OKAY THERE ARE SOME BOUNDARIES. IF WE HAVE ABUSE THAN WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT ABUSE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF CHARTERING IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW -- TOGETHER HAS TO AND PAID SOME ATTENTION TO I THINK WE PAY SOME ATTENTION TO AND THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD FOCUS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME ARE THE FOCUS JUST PURELY ON LINE SECOND THIS IS THE THE AT THE TENSION THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYING. TO UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T BE SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY. BECAUSE CENTER GLAZER ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR DRAW SO. YES THANK YOU. SEE WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE EASIER -- ONE I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THIS IS. A SIMPLE. ISSUE THAT UNFORTUNATELY -- HAS BECOME TOO COMPLICATED -- THE OTHER LINES THESE LINES IN YOUR DISTRICT. HIS LINES THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN TERMS OF WHO RUNS WHO AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE WHO'S HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO LET'S BE REAL AND LET'S BE PRACTICAL ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. AND LOCAL CONTROL. IS EVERYBODY POUNDS ON THE TABLE ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL WELL LET'S ACT ON IT LET'S BELIEVE YOU KNOW LET'S ACT ON WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. SO I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EASY -- ONE TO SORRY TO SAY. OF IT JUST BECOMES ANOTHER -- GROUP VERSUS ANOTHER GROUP SO I'M SORRY YOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCH HARD WORK ANDTAKING ON THE SIMPLE ISSUE SO I WILL DEFINITELY BE SUPPORTING THANK. THANK YOU CENTER DORADO SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD COMPLICATED ISSUE AND COURSE WE ALL LIVE FIRST HAND -- THE TO USE THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE SENATE CREATIVE VALLEY I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS A NEW SUPERINTENDENT THE NEW BOARD MEMBERS AND SO. HOPEFULLY THAT THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN CORRECTED SO I GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPONENTS FIRST ONE BECAUSETHIS IS SOMETHING I WAS THINKIN ABOUT AND THEN YOU BROUGHT IT UP IN YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT YOU COULDN'T ARTICULATE MORE ON IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET TWO MINUTES SO -- COUPLING IF FIFTEEN OH FIVE IN FIFTEEN OH SEVEN IF THEY BOTH WERE TO PASS YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR SCHOOL -- SCHOOL WHICH I GOOGLE IN SCOTT FABULOUS REVIEWS IT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY IN PERIL SO CAN YOU EXPAND EXPAND ON THAT. YES AFTER. WE WILL HAVE TO GO OF ODYSSEY WAS JUST RENEWED BY LA COUNTY -- IN IS MY MY NOT ON HE TURNED IT ON FOR YOUR GOOD OKAY THANK YOU -- SO AND WE WERE REACH WE ARE JUST RECENTLY NEW TO RENEW THAT OUR TWENTIETH YEAR -- AND SO IF WE HAD TO GO BACK TO PASADENA UNIFIED TO SEEK AN AMMO YOU AT OUR FIT AT OUR FIFTH YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THEY SAID NO T THIS MOMENT AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILLS TO BE MOVING QUITE QUICKLY -- BUT WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS IS THAT WE WOULD AND THEN HAVE AN APPEAL PROCESS EITHER -- AND THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR BY WE WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY CLOSE WE CURRENTLY ARE IN AND HAVE BEEN IN A FEW ES DE FACILITY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS -- AND HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH IN THE LAW OF HAVING ONE SCHOOL OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF OUR AUTHORIZED -- IF WE HAVE TO GO BACK UNDER THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN -- WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO SOUTH PASADENA AND THERE WOULD BE NO PLACE FOR US TO GO THERE THAT'S A DISTRICT OF FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND HE WAS THE AS A DISTRICT OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS SO IT'S QUITE SMALL TO TRY AND FIND A FACILITIES WITHIN SOUTH PASADENA. GREAT THANK YOU -- SO QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE ATTORNEY SO WANTED THE CRITICISM I HEAR ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS IS AS AT THE CHERRY PICK. AND THEY AVOID. ENGLISH AS SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS OR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND SO I I THINK YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES CONSIDERING YOU GUYS REPRESENT TWO THIRDS OF ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO I LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE RESOURCE CENTER AND HOW. ALL THAT IS USED TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION A YES YOU KNOW CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE TO ENROLL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO ENROLL IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND ONLY AFTER THEY ARE AT CAPACITY IS A MOMENT DETERMINED BY PUBLIC RANDOM DRAWING. NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE LIMITED TO SERVING STUDENTS WHO RESIDE WITHIN THEIR COUNTY AND ADJACENT COUNTY SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS POTENTIALLY HAVE STUDENTS COMING. FROM WITHIN THEIR COUNTY AND ADJACENT COUNTIES AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAW SAYS YOU MUST ENROLL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO ATTEND. WHAT THAT MANS IS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ALL THOSE STUDENTS THE EDUCATION CODE -- FIVE ONE SEVEN FOUR SIX SAYS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE SAME RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD GET IT OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE LEARNING CENTERS -- LEARNING CENTERS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTING TO DURING SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPPORTS ITS ULTRA HOT THAT'S ALSO THE THAT'S ALSO THE PLACE WHERE WE ALLOW FOR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN. NON DISABLED PEERS -- AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AS WELL AS SO IF WE LIMIT -- IF WE LIMIT THE RESOURCE CENTERS -- JUST TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED WE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STUDENTS WHERE THEY LIVE. SO IF THE CHARTER SCHOOL PREDOMINANTLY -- IS LOCATED -- LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED BOUNDARIES -- THAT IS A LARGE VERY LARGE COUNTY -- IF WE ONLY LIMIT OUR FACILITIES TO TO THAT DISTRICT -- AND WE ARE AND LET'S SAY WE'VE GOT FIVE TO TEN KIDDOS THAT ARE AN ORANGE COUNTY -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REQUIRE THEM TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND ASSESSMENTS. I MEAN EVEN ARGUABLY STANDARDIZED TESTING -- WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW -- BECAUSE THE LAW IS SO BROAD TO TOES TO LIMIT US TO HAVE NOT HAVING RESOURCE CENTERS MEETING SPACES OR ANY OTHER SATELLITE FACILITY. OF RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE THE LAW IS LIMITING ENOUGH IT SAYS THAT WE CAN ONLY HAVE A FACILITY. AND AN ADJACENT COUNTY IF WE ARE PRIMARY EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ARE WITHIN -- WITHIN THE COUNTY IN WHICH WERE AUTHORIZED AND THE MAJORITY OF SERVE AS STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE ARE RESIDING WITHIN THE AUTHORIZING COUNTY I THINK THESE LIMITS ARE ENOUGH AND I I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE. RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE ANSWER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CERTAINLY THANK YOU I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO ADDRESS AT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY SENATE COLLEAGUES HERE. TODAY AND AND BY THE OPPOSITION -- PART OF THE REASON IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT WE GET THE COUNTY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS RIGHT IN FIFTEEN OH FIVE IS BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED -- THERE ARE MEANINGFUL REASONS FOR COUNTY AUTHORIZED CHARTERS TO EXIST SOME OF THOSE REYES BY SENATOR GLAZER WERE SOMETIMES LINES ARE SIMPLY ARBITRARY AND THE ABILITY TO FIND A FACILITY DOESN'T FIT LEARN ARBITRARY LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AT THAT BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE REALLY REALLY REFINED NOT. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION WE HAVE GOT IN THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION TO STOP LETTING THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. AND THE RIGHT AND THE ETHICAL WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS IN NEEDING TO REFINE AND DEFINE HOW CHARTER SCHOOLS OPERATE IN TANDEM AND IN COOPERATION WITH THE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY ARE SERVING STUDENTS. AND IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH A SYSTEM WHERE THE RIGHT POINT OF INTERACTION FOUR CHAIR CHARTER PARENTS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION TEAMS IS THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE BINARY. AN OPPOSITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AND NOT COME TO THE TABLE AS COMMUNITIES. AND AS AN INSTITUTION WE HAVE GOT TO BE CRITICALLY CAREFUL OF WAITING INTO A SPACE OF CHECKING THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF DULY ELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SCHOOL BOARDS ARE. I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT A CITY GOVERNMENT IS A DULY ELECTED MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. AND IF THE CITY ABOUT GROVER TO SAY TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WE NEED MORE POLICING WE THINK WE DO COMMUNITY COMMUNITY POLICING WITH A BETTER MODEL. AND INCIDENTALLY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO LOCATE A NEW POLICE FACILITY WITHIN OUR CITY BOUNDARIES. SO WE'RE GONNA LOCATED A FEW BLOCKS AWAY IN SACRAMENTO I KNOW BY THE WAY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WILL BE POLICING YOUR STREETS. AS A STATE LEGISLATURE WOULD WE ALLOW THAT MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE OVERREACH. I THINK NOT. AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT A LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD HAS JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE PLACE OF GOVERNANCE WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO ALLOW CHARTERS TO START TO ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. THIS IS ONE STEP TOWARD DOING THAT. THERE WAS MAJORITY CONSENSUS ON THE TASK FORCE THAT THIS IS ONE AREA WE NEED TO IMPROVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY FOR SOMETHING THAT IS MORE THAN A DECADE LONG PROBLEM. WHEN I SAW THEM AND SERVED ON THE NEW HOME SCHOOL BOARD WE STARTED DEALING WITH THIS THE YEAR I WAS ELECTED SO NINE YEARS? I HAVE WATCHED THIS AND WHILE THEREARE OF COURSE WELL INTENTIONED GREAT OPERATING CHARTERS WHO ARE SERVING STUDENTS WILL WELL WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND FIND OPTIONS FOR THEM. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT HEADLINES TIME AND AGAIN WE'VE SEEN ABUSES AND INDICTMENTS AND WASTE OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDS WHICH FRANKLY SHOULD BE GOING ALL OF THESE KIDS. CHARTER KIDS IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOL PUBLIC KIDS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS IN CASES LIKE THESE WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN OUT OF DISTRICT AUTHORIZATION. AND THE PERSON OR THE BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT OVERSIGHT IS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY A SLEEP AT THE SWITCH COLLECTING OVERSIGHT FEES. SO I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN WE HAVE A MOTION. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR DORADO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HIM TO AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA I WILL KNOW WILK NO CHIANG LASSELL BUDDHA SO I GLAZER. GLAZER NO MCGUIRE PAN.

HOWEVER THE HISTORY OF LAOTIAN REFUGEES AND THE COUNTRY OF LAOS WHICH IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE HISTORY OF THE VIETNAM WAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN SB EIGHT NINETY FIVE AS AN OVERSIGHT. THIS IS NOT A NEW A NEW CURRICULUM BILL THIS IS A CLEAN UP LANGUAGE TO CORRECT UNINTENTIONAL EXCLUSION OF LAOTIAN AMERICAN HISTORY IT IN SB.

IN ADDITION TO THAT I'M REPRESENTING THE LAOTIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE LEARNED THAT AS BE EIGHT NINE FIVE PASS AND IT WAS NOT INCLUSIVE.

I KNOW SOMEONE OR WHOEVER'S DOING THE BILL WE SHOULD THAT TWENTY OTHER BEHIND HER BILL AND MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE TO DO IT THAT WAY AND APPRECIATE -- YOU LEADERSHIP CENTER WEBER AND US CERTAINLY STAND STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I THINK AND THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN HAVE CENTER GLAZER IN THE CENTER CHIANG [inaudible] SENATE CHECK. THANK YOU SO MUCH HER MANAGER WOMAN I ALSO WANT TO ECHO DR PENS -- COMMENTS AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS CO AUTHOR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU -- SO THE ANALYSIS SAID TALKS ABOUT YOUR BILL IN GREAT DETAIL IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT THE OF COMMITTEES BOTH HOUSES OF CRIED TO SET UP IN REGARD TO THESE TYPES OF THINGS -- AND BUT ALSO IN THE ANALYSIS THAT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION IS GOING THROUGH. TO TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SENATOR WINS BILL FROM. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COMMENT ON THAT. SO A FEW LOOK ON PAGE THREE IT IT IT LAYS DOWN BY DATE THAT -- HOW THEY'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT REQUIREMENT AND -- THEY WERE AT A PERIOD OF TIME IT APPEARS WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO OF PRESENTED DRAFT CURRICULUM. FOR PUBLIC REVIEW IS SET OUT IN IS THAT BEEN -- AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO SEE NO IT'S NOT OUT YET OKAY. SO I GUESS ONE OF THE THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT. THEY COULD VERY WELL IN INCLUDE LAOTIAN HISTORY IN THAT REVIEW -- IN THAT CORRECT THAT DRAFT CURRICULUM. AND SO IT RAISES A QUESTION AT AND THE ANALYSIS RAISES THIS QUESTION IS THAT SHOULD WE ALLOW THAT PROCESS TO RUN ITS COURSE AND SEE WHETHER AN INJUSTICE OR AND AN OVERSIGHT IS IS YOU DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR THE BILL. REALLY IS PRESENT THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL INCLUDED ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO INCLUDE. IN THAT DRAFT CURRICULUM THAT WITH THAT IS THAT A FAIR OBSERVATION THEY COULD. AND THEY COULD NOT [inaudible] NOT [inaudible] OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF COURSE IS -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS INCLUDED IN IN A PRESS IN A IN A IN A JUDICIOUS MAN AN APPROPRIATE TIME RATHER THAN WAITING TO SEE IF THERE'S GONNA BE A FALL OUT AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN WE COME BACK. IT WAS CLEAR THAT WAS NOT AT IT OKAY AND IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT FOR EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME OTHER OVERSIGHTS IN PEOPLE THAT IN. AND  OF THE OF THE LAW COMMUNITY. THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE AS THEIR CONCERN IS THAT THEY ARE QUIET GROUP OF PEOPLE OFTENTIMES NOT INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS WHEN THEY CAME TO ME. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WANTED TO BE INCLUDED IN A DISCOVERED THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS NAMED EXCEPT FOR THEM. AND AND SO WE LOOKED AT VARIOUS WAYS OF HOW WE CAN APPROACH IT WHETHER WE WOULD JUST GO AND TRY TO DO IT IN A BACK WAY OR WHATEVER AND WE SAID NO. THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THEIR STORY TOLD. THEY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE FISH A RECORD THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED BY THIS HOUSE SO THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS RECOGNIZEWHO THEY ARE. AND IF THERE'S MORE THAN JUST ONE GROUP OR TWO GROUPS THAT WE TALKED. TO AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND -- WE DECIDED TO DO THE BILL -- KNOWING THAT THIS PROCESS WAS OCCURRING BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WERE INVOLVED IN THE IN THE IN THE COMEDIAN I'M ON THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMITTEE NOW -- BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S THERE WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IT IN A TIMELY MANNER TO HAVE IT INCLUDED WITHOUT WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO GO WRONG AND THEN CORRECT -- DOESN'T COST US ANYTHING TO CORRECTED IN THE BEGINNING TO DO THE INCLUSION AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY. VERY GOOD AND I I I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS AND WHICH YOU'VE ADVANCE THIS BILL. THAT THE THE COMMITTEE -- ANALYSIS. HE DOES THE DRESS THIS BROADER ISSUE OF IDENTIFYING -- BUT WELL DESERVED -- MATTERS OF HISTORY -- THROUGH LEGISLATION AND THEY SAY THAT. THAT -- BOTH HOUSES HAVE TRIED TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF PARTICULAR REQUEST. AND IT SAYS THAT THE THAT THAT THAT THEY THE GENERAL. POLICY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WAS LAID OUT -- DISCOURAGES MEMBERS FROM INTRODUCING MEASURES THE CREATE NEW MODEL CURRICULA NO QUESTION IT DOES -- AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR -- IF WE PROBABLY NOT DONE THAT AND BASICALLY DECIDED TO JUST RELY UPON THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE WE WOULD LET THAT GO FORWARD -- BUT WE DIDN'T DO THAT AND I THINK IN GOING FORWARD BEYOND THIS OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT INSTRUCTIONAL COMMITTEE OUGHT TO OPERATE. AND AND SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF WAY AND WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH IT BUT UGH GIVEN WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIS IS AN EFFORT. TO CORRECT WHAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR -- THAT'S WHAT IT IS IS AN EFFORT TO CORRECT WHAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR BECAUSE THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT THE OTHERS WILL BE INCLUDED. AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE INCLUDED THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY FOR US TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. SENATE GLAZER MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DOCTOR WEBER SURE I WANT TO THANK THE LAO COMMUNITY FOR COMING UP AND FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THIS -- THEY CAME TO ME OVER YEAR AGO AND THEY SAID THEY CAME BECAUSE I'M A FIGHTER. AND I FIGURED I'D WIN AND I SAID WELL THIS IS NOT A REALLY HARD FIGHT I'VE BEEN IN SOME HARD FIGHTS BEFORE IT MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT. SO THIS IS NOT A HARD FIGHT BUT I RESPECT THEM BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM IN MY COMMUNITY AND YOUR COMMUNITY AND AROUND THE STATE. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO. THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO DO IT CORRECTLY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS INCLUDED THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES LEFT OUT. AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND THEY HAVE BEEN THIS IS BEEN EMBRACED BECAUSE EVERYONE REALIZES THAT IF YOU WANTED LISTED RIGHT. LET'S INCLUDE THEM AND NOT EXCLUDE THEM UP AS AN OVERSIGHT AND I WOULD HATE FOR US TO THINK THAT WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO GO THROUGH AND THEN DISCOVER THAT SOMETHING GETS DROPPED AGAIN. AND THEY'RE NOT THERE SO WITH THAT IN MIND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I BILLS AB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THEY'LL THE LAOTIAN AMERICAN HISTORY CURRICULUM PROPOSAL THAT'S HERE.

HOWEVER ONLY THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS UNDER THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE INDEX WERE REQUIRED TO BE MONITORED ANNUALLY RESEARCH OVER MANY DECADES HAVE MADE ONE THING VERY CLEAR. THE PRESENTATION AND CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF STUDENT SUCCESS. THE PROPER ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHER IS ESPECIALLY -- IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE MISA SIMON OF TEACHERS IS MORE COMMON THERE. ADDITIONALLY MISSES SIGN TEACHERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION. CREATING AN UNSTABLE AND LESS EFFECTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SHAHRAM NOT ANGELA TURNER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB -- NINE OH ONE THE ISSUES AND THAT NINE OH ONE ADDRESSES CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ACLU AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- THERE BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT PLACED OVER THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN ON PROBATION CONTRACTS. FOR NORMAL YOUTHFUL BEHAVIOR BASED ON THE BROAD AUTHORITY GRANTED UNDER WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION. SIX FIFTY FOUR TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW WE FILED SUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE OVER THE VIOLATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE -- BASED ON THIS PROGRAM -- SADLY WE HAVE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE UNDER BOTH -- SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR AND SECTION. TWO THIRTY SIX YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO PROBATION FOR VIOLATIONS OF WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SIX OH ONE WHICH MAKES IT AN OFFENSE FOR JUVENILE TO BE TRUE AND OR TO PERSISTENTLY OR HABITUALLY REFUSE TO OBEY THE REASONABLE AND PROPER. ORDERS OF SCHOOL AUTHORITIES. REASONS FOR PLACING IS ON PROBATION IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAVE INCLUDED CREE DELINQUENT SCHOOL MISBEHAVIOR INCORRIGIBLE EDDIE DEFIANCE OR EVEN POOR GRADES. IN ONE CASE A STUDENT WAS PLACED ON PROBATION FOR BEHAVIOR RELATED TO THE GRIEF. FROM THE DEATH OF A BABY SISTER. ENFORCEMENT FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON STUDENTS OF COLOR AGAIN THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED CRIMES. ONCE REFERRED YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS ARE OFTEN TOLD IF THEY DON'T AGREE TO PROBATION THEIR CASES COULD BE REFERRED TO THE DA ALTHOUGH IN MOST OF THESE CASES THERE IS NO OFFENSE FOR WHICH A PETITION WOULD BE FILED. UNDER SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR IN FROM FORMAL PROBATION PROGRAMS OPERATE WITH NONE OF THE SAFEGUARDS OF JUDICIAL PROCESS SUCH AS ACCESS TO COUNSEL OR ADEQUATE NOTICE OF THE CHARGES OR UNDERLYING FACTS OR ANY KIND OF IMPARTIAL DECISION MAKER. YOUNG PEOPLE END UP ON PROBATION CONDITIONS THAT ARE OFTEN MORE PUNITIVE THAN WHAT A JUDGE WOULD ASSIGN. YOU THE GREEDY TERMS INCLUDING SEARCHES OF THEIR PERSONS AND HOMES AS WELL AS RANDOM DRUG TESTING WE KNOW THAT THIS KIND OF SURVEILLANCE BASED PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK WITH USED TO PREVENT FUTURE MISBEHAVIOR. AND INSTEAD PUSHES YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. STUDENTS ACCUSED OF SCHOOL MISBEHAVIOR OR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES SHOULD BE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT TO PROBATION. EIGHTY NINE A ONE LIMIT THE USE OF VOLUNTARY PROBATION TO THOSE CASES WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE. TO ENSURE MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUPPORT OF OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WE URGE YOUR IPHONE.

AS MANY OF US KNOW THE TWENTY TWENTY DECENNIAL CENSUS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE WITH PROPOSED CHANGES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS A POTENTIAL. ADDITION OF A QUESTION OF CITIZENSHIP IS BECOMING. ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA MUST MAKE EXTRA EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT TO COMMUNITIES REGARDLESS OF ETHNICITY OR RESIDENT STATUS ARE PROPERLY COUNTED. AND RECEIVE THEIR FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL FUNDING. SCHOOLS OFFER A SAFE HAVEN FOR FAMILIES TO RECEIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ACCURATE COUNT AND CAN HELP TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACE. A HESITATION TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FOR STRENGTH FROM STRANGERS ABOUT THEIR FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLDS. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE MY ENSURING THAT OUT AT SCHOOL SITES FAMILIES BE PROVIDED INFORMATION REGARDING. THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPLETING THE CENSUS THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS POLICY SET FORTH BY THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE WELCOME AND MEMBERS OKAY -- EIGHTY FOUR NINETY THREE WILL CREATE A MORE SUPPORTIVE AND SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR LGBT Q. STUDENTS BY PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LGBT YOUTH. BOTH AT SCHOOL AND IN THEIR COMMUNITY DESPITE AN OVERWHELMING INCREASING HARASSMENT MANY LGBT STUDENTS TO NOT REPORT THEIR TROUBLES TO SCHOOL STAFF BECAUSE THEY QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT. EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION WILL OCCUR. THIS IN RETURN CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE STUDENTS DO NOT FEEL SAFE AND AREN'T ABLE TO TRULY BE THEMSELVES. THIS IS WHY IT IS CRITICAL THAT TEACHERS AND STAFF BE EQUIPPED WITH A TRADING TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LGBTQ YOUTH. AB FOR NINETY THREE SUPPORTS OUR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BY REQUIRING ONLINE TRAINING FOR TEACHERS OF GRADES. SEVEN TO TWELVE AND ALL OTHER CERTIFIED EMPLOYEES AT THOSE SCHOOLS THE TRAINING WILL INCLUDE SCHOOL SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES FIRST SUPPORTING LGBT Q. STUDENTS. TO TESTIFIED SUPPORT. QUIPUS ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMAN'S OFFICE AND VINCE POMPEII A FORMER EDUCATOR AND ON BEHALF OF A SEVEN MEMBER TODD GLORIA I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GOOD TO ME TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. DEAR DEAR MEMBERS MY NAME IS. SORRY YOUR TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR VINCENT PALM PAY ON I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE AND SPEAK OF SUPPORT OF AB. FOUR NINETY THREE AS A FORMER TEACHER SCHOOL COUNSELOR -- PAST PRESENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND AUTHOR OF IN CALIFORNIA -- SHOULD BE TO YOUTH REPORT I KNOW FIRST HAND THE DESPERATE NEED FOR STAFF TRAINING ON SOME. PARENTING HIGH LEVELS OF YOUR BILLING AND FAMILY REJECTION BUT VERY FEW ARE FINDING SUPPORT AND AFFIRMATION FROM THEIR EDUCATORS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT ONLY CALIFORNIA SAY THAT ALL OF THEIR SCHOOL STAFF OR SUPPORTIVE OF LGBT PEOPLE. AND ONLY 32% SAY THAT THEY ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS THIS IS CALIFORNIA DATA. ARE THESE CALIFORNIA'S STATISTICS ARE TRULY UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY STUDENT OF ANY POPULATION IN ANY STATE IN OUR COUNTRY. RESEARCH PROVES TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WHEN STUDENTS FEEL SAFE AND CONNECTED AT SCHOOL THEIR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GOES UP. THEIR ATTENDANCE RISES AND THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GRADUATION GOES UP. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO IN FACT IS OFTEN IGNORED WHEN IT COMES TO LGBT Q. STUDENTS. AND I'M GONNA BE HONEST ARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SUBJECT MATTER TYPICALLY MAKES DISTRICT DECISION MAKERS UNCOMFORTABLE. I WOULD NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DISTRICTS ON THESE ISSUES I'VE YET TO FIND A SCHOOL THAT A SAFE AND WELCOMING PRETTY STUDENTS WITH OUT MANDATORY STAFF TRAINING. I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT THE HARDWORKING EDUCATORS OF CALIFORNIA ARE HUNGRY FOR THIS TYPE OF TRAINING -- THEY JUST NEED THIS BILL TO PASS SO WE MAKE THIS TRAINING A REALITY. AB FOR NINETY THREE ISN'T ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS OUR ETHICAL OBLIGATION AS INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE ABOUT ALL STUDENTS I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS LIFESAVING BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DRINK WELL AS DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION. AND ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND CO SPONSOR OF AB FOR NINETY THREE IN SUPPORT. THOSE STUDIES SHOW THAT WE HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS ROUTE THE STATE THAT ARE NOT PERFORMING AT LEVELS THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT SCHOOL. HAVE HIGHER RATES OF HOMELESSNESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUICIDE. WITH OUR KIDS SPENDING SO MUCH OF THEIR YOUTH IN OUR HOMES CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO A PLACE FOR THAT MANY HOURS A DAY AND NOT FEELING SAFE OR ACCEPTED. STUDIES FURTHER SHOW THAT ONLY ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND THAT ONLY 10% OF LGBT Q. YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA SEE THAT ALL OF THEIR SCHOOL STAFF OR SUPPORTIVE OF LGBTQ STUDENTS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT WANTS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. HE WANTS TO PRIORITIZE CURRICULUM IN SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS THAT TEACH TOLERANCE ACCEPTANCE AND PROMOTE DIVERSITY. AB FOR NINETY THREE WOULD HELP BUILD THAT. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS WITH THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE LGBT Q. STUDENTS SO THEY HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR A QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION. IN A BEEN A BUYER MEANT THAT SUPPORTS THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIAAND QUALITY CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP IN THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT. AND THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT MANAGER MEMBERS BRIAN HOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WAS FROM SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT. I AM LOOKING AT A SPROUT LGBT COMMUNITY MEMBER AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. KATHY SURE FEEL YOU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MAKE. ROOM FOR HER TO SIT DOWN WITH BOTH OF THEM FOR THE GENERAL IF YOU CAN JUST STEP BACK THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. RIGHT. TWO MINUTES EACH I'LL LET YOU DECIDE WHO BEGINS. UP AGAIN OKAY VERY GOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RACHEL BILSON AND I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO BE TEACHING TKA THROUGH THIRD GRADES AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. TODAY I'M SPEAKING AS AN INDIVIDUAL. I WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR ANY CHILD REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE RELIGION OR GENDER. HOWEVER I STRONGLY OPPOSE AB. FOUR NINE THREE IF AB FOUR NINE THREE BECAME LAW IT MAY HAVE HARMFUL EFFECTS ON MANY STUDENTS AND THE RIGHTS OF EDUCATORS. AND THE CLEARLY ELEMENTARY GENDER TRAINING I RECENTLY RECEIVED FOR GRADES T. K. THROUGH. EIGHT I WAS TOLD TO USE PREFERRED PRONOUNS TO ADDRESS STUDENTS TO STOP REFERRING TO STUDENTS BY THEIR BIOLOGICAL GENDERS AS BOYS AND GIRLS AND TO TEACH SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND VARIOUS GENDER IDENTITIES. ALL OF WHICH SEEK TO COURSE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO ACCEPT AN EXPRESS IDEAS ABOUT GENDER AND GENDER IDENTITY THAT MAY VIOLATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL BELIEFS AND CONSCIENCES. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THE GENDER BINARY WHICH IS ROOTED IN OBJECTIVE BIOLOGY AS OPPOSED TO SUBJECTIVE THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS BIOLOGY IS NOT BIGOTRY. THIS BILL MAY VIOLATE THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHICH REQUIRES GOVERNMENT NEUTRALITY ON RELIGION. LGBT Q. TRAININGS OFTEN CAST pRELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF MANY PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATORS. THE US SUPREME COURT HAD DETERMINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT. PRESS IDEAS OR THOUGHTS WITH WHICH THEY DISAGREE THE US SUPREME COURT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PARENTS HAVE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN NOT THE STATE. TOLERANCE IS A TWO WAY STREET FAMILIES AND STUDENTS WHO HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF SEXUALITY AND GENDER THAT ARE PROMOTED BY AB FOUR NINE THREE FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WHO ARE FIRM THE GENDER BINARY. MUST HAVE THEIR BELIEVES TOLERATED IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT IS THE LAW IN IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS BILL WILL LIKELY LEAD TO MORE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS LEAVING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO JOIN GROWING RANKS OF PRIVATE AND HOMESCHOOLS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. SENATOR LEYVA AND OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. I AM DOCTOR LORI HAYNES CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGIST REFUSING SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS LISTED IN MY HAND OUT WITH. WE ALL WANT VICTIMIZATION FOR LGBT STUDENTS AND STUDENTS ALL STUDENTS TO DECREASE. BUT AB FOUR NINE THREE WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE. AN ALARMING HARRIS POLL FOUND THAT YOUNG ADULTS AGES. EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR OUR FEELING PROGRESSIVELY LESS COMFORTABLE WITH LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS. AND WITH AND WITH AFFIRMATIVE EDUCATION. THEY'VE HAD IT WAS A TAX ON THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS WOMEN AND GIRLS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. SO DOING THE SAME THING ONLY MORE OF IT. IS IN AB FOUR NINE THREE WILL NOT END WELL. THERE IS A BETTER WAY THE GLISTEN SURVEY FOUND TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS HAD THE LOWEST BOWLING AND VICTIMIZATION OF L. G. B. KEEP STUDENTS OTHER BROACHES WORK. THE GLISTEN SURVEY ALSO FOUND MANY SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE GENERIC ANTI BULLYING POLICIES TEACHERS AND MINISTERS JUST NEED TRAINING TO ENFORCE THEM EFFECTIVELY. TEN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SAY LGBTQ FEELINGS ARE NOT JUST BIOLOGICALLY BORN THAT WAY OR WHO SOMEONE IS THERE A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES. TO LGBT Q. AND QUESTIONING FEELINGS COMMONLY DIMINISH OUR RESOLVE FOR SOME MINERS BY ADULTHOOD. BUT SOCIAL AFFIRMATION BY TEACHERS AND PEERS THAT AB FOUR NINE THREE MANDATES LOCK IN LGBT Q. FEELINGS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE RESULT FOR MANY. DO YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. BLOCKING AND TRANS GENDER IDENTITY ST STUDENTS DONE A TREATMENT PATH OF HORMONES AND SURGERIES LEADING TO LOSS OF SEXUAL PLEASURE. FERTILITY ARRESTS IN REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND HIGHER RATES OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATIONS DEATHS FROM HEART DISEASE AND CANCERS. I AM NINETEEN TIMES MORE COMPLETED SUICIDES DO YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. PLACE AB FOUR NINE THREE WITH A TRULY INCLUSIVE AND SAFE POLICY FOR ALL. STUDENTS TEACHERS AND PARENTS CAN GET BEHIND THAT IT COULD WORK. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE THERE. GREG BURKE WITH CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY AS THE PROUD MOTHER OF A GAY DAUGHTER I FIND A LOT OF WHAT THE THE OPPOSITION SAID TO BE QUITE OFFENSIVE. AND I THINK THAT IF WE AS A SOCIETY DO NOT LEARN ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. THAT IS ONE WE HAVE BULLYING AND THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND I WILL PUT MY DAUGHTER UP AGAINST ANYONE'S STRAIGHT DAUGHTER WHICH WE HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS STRAIGHT. THEY ARE BOTH WONDERFUL YOUNG WOMEN AND WHO SHE LOVES SHOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY SHE LIVES HER LIFE SO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. AND I WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED WILL TAKE A VOTE AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I THINK YOU JUST DID MY CLOSING. ITEM SEVEN A. B. FOR NINETY THREE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK. CHIANG WRESTLE WITH US SO I GLAZER REQUIRES PAN. WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL AND WE WILL NOW MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB NINE THIRTY THANK YOU WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS -- AB NINE THIRTY WILL PROMOTE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY TRANSPARENCY BY PROHIBITING THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES FROM INCREASING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. IN YEARS WHEN STUDENT TUITION IS INCREASED. THE U. S. C. AT YOU SO US. YOUTH. YOU U. S. WE CSCO SORRY ABOUT CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGES TO THE SALARIES OF EXECUTIVES VOTE TO INCREASE TUITION BY 5%? FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY AND JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES VOTED TO INCREASE SALARIES FOR PRESIDENTS BY 3% DESPITE GOVERNOR BROWN'S. URGE TO REJECT THE AUGMENTATIONS. AB NINE THIRTY WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE FOLLOWING. FIRST EXECUTIVE PAY CANNOT INCREASE IN YEARS IN WHICH THERE IS A TUITION INCREASE SECOND ANY CHANGES TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OR INCREASES TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MUST BE PLACED ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AGENDA. FOR AN INITIAL PUBLIC HEARING. WITH A VOTE TO TAKE PLACE AT THE AT THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE HEARING. FINALLY CSU CHANCELLOR MUST MANDATE EACH CAMPUS TO PREPARE AND REPORT. BY AN OLD COMPARISONS OF THE% CAMPUSES BUDGET TO ITS ACTUAL SPENDING LEVELS. LAST YEAR WHICH WAS A HUGE WIN IN SECURING STUDENT ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND EQUITY WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM WE MUST CONTINUE THIS TREND BY PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY DOES JUST THAT. I WILL LET MY WITNESSES HERE TESTIFY AND INTRODUCE THEMSELVES -- AND THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND ON BEHALF OF US IN THE MEMBER TODD GLORIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER EGAN ON THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS POLITICAL ACTION AND LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND ADMINISTRATION AT CAL STATE EAST BAY. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AS THE SPONSOR OF AB. NINE THIRTY EIGHTY NINE THIRTY SIX TO ADDRESS A LONG STANDING PROBLEM OF THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. IT'S LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. AS WE ALL KNOW STUDENT TUITION HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST DECADE AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND CURRENT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. STUDENT TO ISSUE STUDENT TUITION WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. AS NOTED IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT RELEASED JUNE TWENTIETH LAST YEAR THE CSU ACCUMULATED A DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS WORTH MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ITS OPERATING FUND. A SURPLUS THAT HAS COME PRIMARILY FROM STUDENT FEES AND TUITION. THE AUDIT CONCLUDED THAT STUDENTS LACK THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED THEM TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR THOSE TUITION INCREASES. ONE OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF AB NINE THIRTY IS TO PROVIDE AND A WINDOW FOR MEANINGFUL PUBLIC COMMENT PRIOR TO BOARD ACTION WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION -- AND TO PROHIBIT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FROM INCREASING IN YEARS IN WHICH STUDENT TUITION GOES UP. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE CS USE ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET IS FUNDED BY STUDENT TUITION. AND ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MORE EIGHTY NINE THIRTY REQUIRES ALL TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES TO SUBMIT BI ANNUAL BUDGET REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO VERIFY THEIR FINANCIAL ACTIVITY SOMETHING THAT IS CLEARLY NEEDED AND LONG OVERDUE. LASTLY IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE CSU FALLS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH HAS THE DISCRETION TO EXPAND OR LIMIT OR REPEAL THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE BUSINESS OF USUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND ASK YOU TO PROVIDE GREATER OVERSIGHT OF OUR NATION'S LARGEST FOR YOUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO THANK YOU AND ON BEHALF OF CFA WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR EITHER. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR LEYVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS HANNAH BRAG SAD AND I AND LEGISLATIVE POLICY ANALYST FOR THE CALIPHATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION. CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA AND CFA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AS YOU KNOW TUITION FOR THE CSU SYSTEM HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SO HAVE THEIR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS BILL ENCOURAGES TRANSPARENCY IN OUR SYSTEM BY REQUIRING THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO INCLUDE PROPOSED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INCREASES ON THEIR AGENDA. INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND PUBLIC HEARING PRIOR TO BEING CONSIDERED FOR A VOTE AT THE NEXT CONSECUTIVE MEETING. I STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING MORE AND MORE TO MAKE ENDS MEET THEY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND HAVING TO BEAR THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL BURDEN AND AS A RESULT ARE FACING HIGH AMOUNTS OF STUDENT HOUSING AND SECURITY. AND THIS LAST YEAR OUR BOARD IS SUPPORTED TO RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR BETTER MORE TRANSPARENT PRACTICES OF THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AS IT RELATES TO INCREASES IN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. WHICH IS WHY OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS BILL INTRODUCED WE ASK FOR YOU TO SUPPORT AB NINE THIRTY SO THAT SALARY INCREASES DO NOT FALL ON THE BACKS OF OUR STRUGGLING STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARIO GROUND THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS MENTION WERE COSPONSOR I'M ALSO ACTION FACULTY AT SACRAMENTO STATE SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SO MUCH A GOOD AFTERNOON EDGE MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY -- WE REGRETFULLY MUST BE OPPOSE THE MEASURE -- WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THE AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MORE TRUSTEES TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN IT HAS. S. MASTER PLAN HAS PROVIDED US THAT BENEFITS. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENTS ARE CSU CAMPUSES AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE FEMALE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE SYSTEM. WE DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THE THE TWIST EVERY CHARGE WHICH IS BASED ON CERTAIN FEES AND THE GENERAL FUND FROM THE STATE. AND THE CONCEPT OF RIGHT FOR EMPLOYEES. THAT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OF THE OPPOSE THE MEASURE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU I AM COMING IN LATE WHICH I APOLOGIZE FOR WERE DOUBLE BOOKED HERE IN THE CAPITAL -- I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS BILL PRIOR TO THE HEARING OF THE ME. FOR SIX IN IT IT'S A COUPLE THINGS -- I GUESS YOU'RE PRESENTING IT FOR YEAH. IN TRYING. TO YOU KNOW LOOK I'LL DO MY BEST -- I REMEMBER MY I WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES -- IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND I VIVIDLY REMEMBER MY FIRST -- BOARD MEETING. BECAUSE ON THE AGENDA WAS A SELECTION OF THE NEW PRESIDENT AT SAN DIEGO STATE. ALONG WITH A SUBSTANTIAL RAISE. I IN HIS COMPENSATION. AND OF COURSE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE WERE IN BIG BUDGET MELTDOWN. AND WHILE WE DID NOW WHAT KIND OF TUITION INCREASE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT YEAR. THIS IS THE SYSTEM LOST A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS SO WE WERE IT WAS AND AND ND AND AND HIGH. END AND REAL PROBLEMS. AND I OF COURSE WENT TO SAN DIEGO STATE. AND I HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE SELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT. BUT WHEN THAT VOTE. TO TO PROVIDE THAT COMPENSATION I I WAS ONE OF I THINK -- TO TRUSTEES VOTE NOW -- AND THEN THROUGH THE COURSE OF MY FOUR YEARS ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. I DIDN'T SUPPORT ANY -- INCREASING PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES. AND I I SAY THAT BECAUSE HEY I SEE THAT YOU I AND I WAS FORCED TO VOTE A NUMBER OF TIMES TO RAISE TUITION. NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME YEAR THAT I HAD TO VOTE FOR THE SALARY INCREASE BUT IT WAS THE TIMES WERE VERY DIFFICULT. THIS MUCH IS A I NOBODY WANTED TO RAISE TUITION. I GUESS WHAT TROUBLES ME ABOUT THIS BILL IS A FROM A COUPLE DIFFERENT PLACES NUMBER -- ONE THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND WHAT DO YOU LIKE THE MARIA DR ALL APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. NOT ALL OF THEM IF CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE THEY'RE THERE TO EXERCISE THEIR BEST JUDGMENT. ABOUT HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING TO THEM. GONNA TAKE AWAY THAT RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DICTATE HOW YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT OKAY SO I HAVE A PROBLEM ON THAT LEVEL. BUT THE THE OTHER LEVEL THAT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE. IT'S IT'S RIGHT FROM THE DEREGULATION. IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN -- SAY. THAT I MEAN DID YOU WANT TO PRESIDENT. TO ALLOW A SYSTEM DETERIORATE MEANING I'M NOT GOING TO INCREASE TUITION SO THAT THEY CAN GET A RAISE. IS THAT THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES CREATED IN THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF ITS ALL ABOUT THEM THAT'S REALLY THE PREMISE. THAT MEANS THEY'RE GONNA NOT DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE QUALITY AND THE AT THE SYSTEM. IN ORDER JUST GET COMPENSATION FOR THIRTY PEOPLE. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PERVERSE INCENTIVE THAT'S CREATED IN THIS BILL. IT SEEMS TO ME AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO WISH INCREASES. AND DOESN'T LIKE TO PAY OUR PRESIDENTS A LOT OF MONEY FOR CERTAINLY. HAS THAT AS A LOT OF TIMES IT'S PROPOSE. AND AND THAT'S THE DILEMMA FOR SOMEONE [inaudible] LIKE ME. YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER YES WE RESPOND TO THAT -- YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE. YOU SENATOR GLAZER WHEN YOU ARE ON THE BOARD SHOWING RESTRAINT REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION I THINK THE HISTORY ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS SHOWN THAT VERY FEW TRUSTEES. HAVE SHOWN RESTRAINT IN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SIMILARLY THE BORDER THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS NOT SHOWN RESTRAINT WHEN IT COMES TO INCREASING STUDENT FEES ALMOST ALL OF THE HOLES ON THE INCREASE IN STUDENT FEES HAVE BEEN FROM THE EXECUTIVE FROM FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. AND NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME WHO MADE SURE THAT STUDENT FEES WERE. NOT AND NOT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET -- AND WE'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THE RECENT AUDIT WELL ON THE I STARTED TEACHING AT BAY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SO I GUESS THIS IS MY TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY. AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I FIRST STARTED TEACHING WE DID NOT HAVE FOOD PANTRIES ON EVERY CAMPUS AND WE DO NOW AND WE DON'T NEED WE DID NOT HAVE ANY. NO ONE WAS TALKING ABOUT LEADING STUDENTS SLEEP IN THEIR CARS BECAUSE THEY WERE HOMELESS. THE EFFECTS OF THE CHOICES OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAVE. HI HELD UP OVER THE YEARS AND LET US TO WHERE WE ARE AND WE FEEL AS AT THAT THE CSU NEEDS MORE OVERSIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN WITHHOLDING THOSE STUDENT FEES PROP FROM PROVIDING REAL STUDENT SERVICES. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD STEWARDS OF THE SYSTEM THE CSU ISN'T STATUTE AND WE FEEL THAT DAY IT IS TIME. FOR THEM TO BE UNDER THAT CONSTRAINT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER GLAZER IS AT ALL DO YOU REALLY QUESTIONS. WELL I I THINK THERE WAS NOBODY ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES SECURE. REYES SALARIES AND A YEAR IN WHICH YOU HAVE. A TUITION INCREASE THEN DO YOU PUT THE PRESSURE IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA I KNOW NO ONE LIKES TO RAISE TUITION RIGHT BUT IT'S ALL. IT'S ALL ON US IT'S ABOUT HOW WE COMPENSATE HOW WE HOW WE PUT IN THE BUDGET EACH YEAR. TO PROVIDE FOR WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO RUN AND WE'VE BEEN IN A COUPLE GOOD YEARS BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS GOOD YEARS. AND SO IT'S A VERY TOUGH CHOICE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE CERTAINLY FOR THE TRUSTEES AND SO DO YOU CREATE A WAY A PERVERSE INCENTIVE WHEN YOU SAY TO THE LEADERSHIP YOU CAN'T HAVE A REYES YOU CAN HAVE YOUR 3%. WHATEVER IT IS COST OF LIVING WHATEVER IT IS YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT. IF YOU RAISE TUITION IS THAT REALLY GONNA. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S GONNA WORK THAT DECISION WOULD NOT YOU WANT TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION YOU'RE PUTTING THEIR SELF INTEREST NOW. INTO A DECISION ON TUITION. AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT WELL I HAVEN'T MET A BOARD OF TRUSTEES YET -- IS AN ENTIRE BOARD THAT WASN'T REALLY QUITE EAGER TO RAISE STUDENT FEES SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO REEL THEM IN. THIS DOES CREATE SOME PRESSURE THAT THEY APPARENTLY DON'T FEEL INTERNALLY. OKAY WELL I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE ANSWERING THE QUESTION JUST TO BE CLEAR. AND FROM THE TRUSTEES POINT OF VIEW. THEY'VE TO THE FROZEN PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES THE LAST I DON'T KNOW SEVEN EIGHT YEARS. AT EIGHT EIGHT WHEN YOU HIRE AT A A NEW PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS DID THEY PAY THEM MORE THAN THE PREDECESSOR. AND HUMBLED THOSE JUST SELECTED. AB THAT THE SYSTEM CAN ANSWER THAT. FOR THE FOR THE POLICY ADOPTED BY THE BOARD THEY CAN GO UP 210% THEY DO NOT GO ABOVE 10% THE BILL PAY THE PREVIOUS SALARY. OKAY SO THE BOARD SET OF POLICY THAT YOU CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN 10%. OVER THE EXISTING SALARY OF THAT PRESIDENT WHO COULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS. RIGHT HAVING A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THANK YOU CREATING A IN A LOT I DON'T THINK THAT ONE ANSWER THAT. YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT YOU SEEN THAT THE TRUSTEES JUMPING UP AND DOWN TO GO RAISE TUITION EITHER. IT'S BEEN ONE TUITION INCREASE IN WHAT SEVEN YEARS IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY ONE TUITION INCREASE IN SEVEN YEARS HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL POLICY THAT PUTS A LIMIT A CAP ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN. PAY A PRESIDENT. SO WHERE IS THE REASON FOR THIS BILL. TO ANSWER YOUR CALL YOUR EARLIER QUESTION. MADAM CHAIR -- YOU LAST IF THIS. PROVIDES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT DOES NOT NOTHING IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS -- A AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION. WHAT IT DOES IS IT SETS FOR THAT YEAR JUST THAT YEAR WHERE THERE IS AN INCREASE IN TUITION THERE IS NO I EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INCREASE? YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF THAT IN SEVEN YEARS HAS BEEN ONE SO THAT ONE YEAR THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RACE -- EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BUT ALL THOSE OTHER YEARS THEY CAN CERTAINLY CONSIDER THAT. RIGHT WITH THE IF THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO LIVE PUT A LIMIT ON PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES. REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS ISN'T IT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO RAISE TUITION HERE. TRYING TO CAP PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES. RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE GOAL. THE GOAL IS ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND TO ENSURE THAT THE BOARD IS A GOOD STEWARDS OF THE FUNDING AND THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE. EVERYONE IF WE ARE HURTING AS A STATE. THAT NOT IF THE STUDENTS ARE GONNA HURT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULDN'T NECESSARILYBENEFIT AT THAT TIME ONE FINAL FOLLOW UP AND SHARE. IS THAT WELL THEN SHOULD YOU PUT THAT ON US THAT WERE THE ONE WHO PROVIDES THE BUDGET TO THE SYSTEM. SO SHOULD THIS LOSS SAY THAT WE CAN INCREASE LEGISLATIVE SALARIES IN A YEAR IN WHICH WE DON'T FULLY FIND. THE SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE TO RAISE TUITION I MEAN IS THAT IS NOT THE ACT OF PUTTING IT WHERE IT REALLY STARTS WHICH IS US. NOT THE PRESIDENT'S THEY'RE NOT THE ONES DECIDING ON TUITION. RIGHT THROUGH THE US IN THE BUDGET THAT WE FIND EVERY YEAR ISN'T IT MADAM CHAIRMAN ANSWER THE QUESTION SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- IN -- ARE. THEIR OWN ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR EXAMPLE YOU DON'T GET COMPENSATED OF THE BUDGET DOESN'T PASS SOMETIME. THAT'S GREAT IN TERMS OF THIS BODY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORITY OVER. THE CSU IT'S A CREATURE OF THE BODY AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY CHOOSE TO GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL POWERS OR EXERCISE ADDITIONAL COME. OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO TO EXERCISE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. I WOULD JUST SAY TO A CENTER GLAZER TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'VE GIVEN. SALARIES FOR PRESIDENTS HAVE GONE UP ONCE IN SEVEN YEARS AND EXCUSE ME THE TUITIONS KIND OF POINTS IN SEVEN YEARS I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS OPTICS AS WELL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS DON'T FEEL LIKE. PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING WHEN THEY'RE SHELLING OUT MORE MONEY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE OPTICS AND MAKING SURE THAT. THOSE THAT ARE IN POWER AREN'T IN REACHING THEMSELVES IN A TIME OR IN A YEAR WHEN STUDENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHELL OUT MORE MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S HAPPENING EVERY YEAR WE KNOW IT'S NOT HAPPENING EVERY YEAR SO IT'S JUST WAY TO BE A LITTLE SMARTER. AND THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA GIVE OURSELVES A RAISE WE SURE XIN ELSE FOR TUITION INCREASE AS WELL. AND I HATE TO SAY IT BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE THAT PUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM SO THAT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT IT -- BUT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS CENTER DRAWS A DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PASSED FROM MY VERY GOOD ARE WE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER DRAWS -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

I HAVE THE A THE JOINT AUTHORS HERE WHO ELSE LIKE PERCENT IT'S OKAY WITH YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY OKAY. UBER MCCARTY HAS VERY GREAT WELL OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME SUCCESS IN THE BUDGET THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THIS -- BUILDS UPON THAT TEN MISTER SANTIAGO TALKED ABOUT THE BILL ALSO SAY YOU KNOW WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR MUTUAL INTEREST HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOCUSING ON OUR STUDENTS. ARE COLLEGES AND OUR ECONOMY AS WE KNOW. STUDENT DEBT IS A HUGE HUGE -- ISSUE FOR THIS GENERATION -- IS NOT JUST -- TUITION ITS BOOKS OF HOUSING WHICH WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS BUT SHE OF THE COMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE STICKER SHOCK ISRAEL SO HAVING LESS DEBT FOR STUDENTS WHEN THEY GRADUATE I REALLY MATTERS AND HAVING THEM GO FULL TIME ALLOW THEM TO GRADUATE WITHOUT LAST DEBT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FACING DECLINING ENROLLMENT SO WE'VE SEEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN LA. THIS WHOLE -- MONTROSE BARS FREE COLLEGE ISN'T JUST A BUMPER STICKER BANNER IT'S REALLY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE SIDELINES TO ENROLL IN THE COLLEGE'S. BUILDING AT THE ROMAN AND AGAIN THE STUDENTS HAVE HIGHER SUCCESS RATES BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING. A FULL TIME LASTLY WE KNOW THAT IN OUR ECONOMY WE NEED MORE EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORK FORCE. NOW WE HAVE THIS -- DEGREE GAP FOR PEOPLE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES BUT ALSO AGREED CAP PER CERTIFICATES WHICH YOU CAN GET AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS WILL HELP. OUR STATE -- REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND SO THIS MEANS ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA GOALS AND CERTAINLY ASK FOR HI BUT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A TALE SHE WAS TALKING TO A REPRESENT LOS ANGELS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT OTHERS SPONSORS OF AB. TWO WE LIKE TO THANK US AND IN OUR THOUGHT SANTIAGO FOR HIS PIONEERING EFFORTS IN THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE THIS IS THE SECOND PIECE OF LEGISLATION HE'S INTRODUCED. ON THE SUBJECT BUT WE ALSO LIKE TAKE A SIMILAR MCCARTY FOR HIS WORK ON THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATURE SUPPORT OF PUTTING THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET. TO FUND THE SECOND YEAR -- AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE IN THE BUDGET. WITH ALL THAT THERE'S STILL A COUPLE OF LOOSE ENDS IF YOU WILL OR THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO SEE -- ROUND OUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COLLEGE PROMISED ONE IS THAT THE BILL STILL CALL FOR A STUDY TO ANALYZE HEALTH DISTRICTS ARE USING THE FUNDS ARE THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IN THE COLLEGE PROBLEMS PROGRAM. AND THE SECOND THING IS A PROVISION THAT GIVES THE COLLEGES DISCRETION TO ACCEPT DISABLED STUDENTS FROM THE FULL TIME TWELVE YOU KNOW REQUIREMENT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE SITUATION AND DISABILITY SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THAT AB TWO SHOWS BEFORE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I AM THE CONTACT US ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE A STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING HEARING THEN I'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTERED RAZA MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I WOULD -- I WAS BRIEF IN MY EARLIER TO MAKE SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE WE WE ALWAYS GOT THAT ALL THE PRESENTATIONS BUT HERE'S WHAT'S KEY ABOUT THE BILL I MEAN ABOUT THE ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT'S ABOUT SUCCESS RATES IN IN LA COUNTY AREA WE SAW ON THE SECOND HOLE COURTS AT ABOUT 83% SUCCESS RATE FROM ONE YEAR TO FIRST YEAR. THE OTHER PIECE IS OFTEN A MISSED. INCLUDED WITHIN THIS MOVEMENT IS THE ABILITY TO SIGN UP EVERY STUDENT FOR THE PASSIVE FORM. WHICH IS THE NON TUITION COSTS SO YOU COULD HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. TEN TO TWELVE TALKING WHO GOES THREE TWENTIES COHORT. I AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S D. IT EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IS THE ABILITY TO TALK TO A COUNSELOR. AND IT'S ALL PART OF THE PIECES THAT WE TALK ABOUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING ON AND LIKE ANY OTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL KEEP WORKING ON ON A ON ON THIS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS ENSURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT. AND WITH THIS ALMOST. BEFORE HERE IN THE MINUTE THAT THAT HOPEFULLY THAT IT SIGNED. ALSO THAT WE GET THE POLICY PIECES RIGHT TO THE BUDGET -- TO THE BUDGET ASPECT OF THIS OF HAVING SAID THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGEL. THANK YOU SIMILAR MCCARTY YOU WANNA CLOSE VERY GOOD THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR ALSO M. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM THREE AB TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK CHAIN WRESTLE. WITH US ALL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. WE BELIEVE THAT BELONG CALL AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OFF AUTHORS SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TIME I THINK YOU HAVE FILE ITEM EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR YES. ARE YOU A START WITH EIGHTEEN YOU HAVE I TAKE THE I THINK THAT MORE SIMPLE ONE FIRST IF YOU'RE LOOKINGFOR FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR YES I WILL SERVE WITH FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR ABC ARE SIXTY FOUR MCCARTY YET AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE READY YES BUT BEFORE THAT IT TO ANOTHER. THANK YOU FOR THE BILL ON CONSENT TODAY THAT SUPPORT ON THAT'S A BILL RELATED TO REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR EASY PROGRAMS AND WE'RE BOTH WORKING ON THAT AND I KNOW THAT THE BIG DIFFERENCE MAKER TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAMS ARE VIABLE. YES. THIS MEASURE HERE AC SIXTY FOUR IS THAT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS REFORM PACKAGE I THINK THEY'RE FIVE BILLS OVER HERE IN THE SENATE. KIND OF A A REACTION TO WHAT HAPPENED THIS PAST WINTER WITH THE OPERATION VARSITY BLUES WITH A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. IT WAS CERTAINLY SHOCKING TO MANY OF US READING ABOUT IT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO STARTED THIS WHOLE PROGRAM LITERALLY STARTED IN MY DISTRICT YEARS YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR. WITH THE WORK AND ONE OF THAT THE SCANS THAT WE SAW. WAS CHEATING RELATED TO THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS -- TESTS SO IN SOME CASES THEY HAD THE PROCTOR GOING CHANGE THE ANSWERS. IN SOME CASES THEY HAD -- INDIVIDUALS FAKE DISABILITIES AND GET MORE TIME TO TAKE THE-SAT AND SAT AND ACT EXAM. THIS OF COURSE IS WRONG BUT ALSO SOMETIMES A NUYS A SPOT FOR QUALIFIED CALIFORNIANS OF THAT WHY THIS REALLY MATTERS BUT THIS REALLY -- BAGS. LARGER QUESTION WHETHER THESE TASKS ARE REALLY APPLICABLES IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO WE KNOW THAT -- THAT YOU SEE IS TAKING UP A LOOK AT THIS -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DOZENS OF COLLEGES ACROSS THE NATION THAT I'VE CHANGED OR STANDARDS FOR THESE. STANDARDIZED TESTS AND WHAT THIS MEASURE HERE WOULD ASK THE UC SYSTEM AND THE CSU TO CONDUCT A STUDY. ON THE USEFULNESS OF FACT IN THIS THE NEED FOR THE SAT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS. STILL NEEDED TODAY WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS -- CERTAINLY I'D NEEDED TO FOCUS ON THE HUGE VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THE KIND OF SORT PEOPLE IN SORT PEOPLE OUT. I THINK WE HAVE A LARGER SOCIETAL QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THIS TRULY ON MEASURES STUDENT SUCCESS AND THERE ARE OTHERS STATE -- FUNDED UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE GOT RID OF THE SYSTEM WE THINK THAT WE CAN. I TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAME THING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS ISN'T. AT CERTAIN REMEDY THIS CERTAINLY ASK THE SYSTEMS THIS WOULD. IN ESSENCE AS A SYSTEM TO DO A THOROUGH STUDY IN EVALUATION REPORT BACK TO US I WITH ME ARE TO STUDENTS. I'M SORRY ONE STUDENT AND ONE ADVOCATES TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS. VERY GOOD TWO MINUTES EACH LA DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST. PLEASE PROCEED. HELLO MY NAME IS CAROL OF MONEY I'LL AND I'M A SECOND YEAR STUDENT AS YOU SEE MERCED -- WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I TOOK THE SAT AND ACT AND? AS A STUDY FOR THE EXAMS I FOUND THAT THE ONLINE QUIZZES AND STUDY GUIDES THAT WERE -- THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR US DID NOT PREPARE ME AS WELL AS A COSTLY EXAM PREPARATION THAT. I FORTUNATE COLLEAGUES HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ACCESSING -- ALTHOUGH WE HELD SIMILAR GPAS IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE TEST PREPARATION AND CONSEQUENTIALLY OUR SCORES RESULTED IN DIFFERENT EMISSIONS INTO UC'S MCSE IS. WHILE I WAS ABLE TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MANY MY WELL ROUNDED PEERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL EXAMS APART WERE DENIED MISSION. THIS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE AND WHEN ANALYZING THE SAT SCORES OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE NATION. THEY'RE JUST. DISPARITIES AMONG MINORITIES AND LOWER INCOME SINCE COMPARISON TO THOSE AND HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC TEARS. I WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE PRIVATE TUTORING OR TEN PREP. I IN THIS COURSE A DEAD. AS IN MANY OTHERS MY COMMUNITY. THE SAT AND ACT IS ARE DESIGNED TO TEST STUDENTS COLLEGE READINESS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A CONVERSATION WITH THAT. I WILL WHETHER THEY BE IN THE YOU SEE THE CSU. ESSENTIALLY THOSE WHO TOOK THE EXAMS AND WE SHOULD ASK THEM IF WHERE THEY TRULY EFFECTIVE. IF NOT WE'LL CONTINUE TO EXCLUDE QUALIFIED AND HARD WORKING STUDENTS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT EXAMS UP FAVOR INDIVIDUALS HIRES THAT SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPECT THE ASPIRIN I'VE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I THOUGHT OF THIS MY GOLLY CAM KATE WITH ADVOCATES WE SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TO EXAMINE THE USEFULNESS OF THE SAT AND ACT AND COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. THESE HIGH STAKES TESTS CAN ACT AS BARRIERS TO COLLEGE ADMISSION FOR MANY LOW INCOME AND STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO CANNOT AFFORD EXPENSIVE TEST PREP AS WE HEARD OR WHO ATTEND HIGH SCHOOLS. THAT DON'T PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE RECENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE BOARD ADMITTED THAT WEALTH INEQUALITY HAS PROGRESSED TO SUCH A DEGREE. THAT IT ISN'T FAIR TO LOOK AT TEST SCORES ALONE AND THAT WE MUST LOOK AT THEM IN CONTEXT OF THE ADVERSITY STUDENTS FACE. AND ACCORDING TO THE UC CENTER FOR STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. QUOTE OF ALL COLLEGE ADMISSION CRITERIA SCORES ON NATIONALLY NORM TESTS LIKE THE SAT AND ACT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THE SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND OF THE STUDENT. FACTORS SUCH AS FAMILY INCOME PARENTS' EDUCATION AND RACE ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 35% OF THE VARIATION OF SAT TEST SCORES THAT YOU SEE. AS OPPOSED EXPLAINING ONLY 8% OF THE VARIATION. WITH USING HIGH SCHOOL GPA. RESEARCH BY POLICY ANALYSIS FOR EDUCATE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION ALSO FOUND THAT HIGH SCHOOL GPA IS A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF FIRST YOUR COLLEGE GPA AND SECOND YOUR PERSISTENCE AT THE CSU. USING HIGH SCHOOL GPA COMBINED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND PROGRESS RESULTS IN A MORE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY AND RACIALLY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE APPLICANT. AS OPPOSED TO USING GPA AND THE SAT. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY MOVED AWAY FROM CONSIDERING THE SAT AND ACT IN ADMISSIONS. AND INSTEAD ARE USING CLASS RANK OR HIGH SCHOOL GPA. ASKING THE CSU AND THE UC TO STUDY NEED AND USE OF THESE TESTS IN THEIR ADMISSIONS POLICIES. ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE MORE EQUITABLE MEASURES IS REASONABLE AND LONG OVERDUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ECONOMY WE HAVE A SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. I HAD A CONTEST ON BEHALF OF MYSELF FORMER UC DAVIS DIDN'T SACRAMENTO GRADUATE. PUSH OFFICE STARTING WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THURMOND MAJID WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIVE CHANCE OFFICE OR BOARD DOES NOT YET HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS RESOLUTION -- BUT WE ARE SUPPORTER OF THE OFFICE ATTACK AND HOPE TO HAVE A FORMER SUPPORT -- LATER THIS MONTH THANK YOU. MANY RODRIGUEZ ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. CATHERINE YOU'RE GONNA ON BEHALF OF COPYING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER IN SUPPORT. LISTEN WHAT IT NO UC SANTA CRUZ ALARM AND FORMER C. S. U. M. B. FACULTY. AND STRONG CSU STANISLAUS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING THAT WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER GLAZER. ONCE AGAIN I THE PRESS OF BUSINESS TODAY HAS. LOBBIED IN THIS I'M SURE YOUR WONDERFUL TESTIMONY BUT I HAVE A CHANCE TO READ THE BILL AND THIS IS THE I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL THIS MAY BE THE BEST BILL. CERTAINLY TODAY IN EDUCATION THAT I'VE SEEN -- ALL. AT ONCE. AND AND THE REASON AND THE REST I DIDN'T MEAN TO DISPARAGE ANY OTHER. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THE AUTHOR PROPS. THIS IS THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S REALLY TROUBLE ME FOR A LONG TIME IN FACT I SENT TO YOU. EARLIER TODAY AN OPINION PIECE I WROTE -- IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MANY YEARS AGO WAS THAT. THIRTY ALL WHILE -- AND IT WAS ON THE SUBJECT OF TESTING AND THE SAT IN THE A. C. T.. AND IT'S TROUBLED ME FOR A LONG TIME THAT. THE WAY THAT THESE TESTERS. DEVELOPED AND ADMINISTERED IN. AND THE ANY THE PROFESSOR'S. BELIEF THAT A DATE IT DEFINES WITH YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. IS REALLY ALL ROCK [inaudible] AND THE I AM SO GLAD THAT THAT YOUR BILL IS GOING TO TRY TO ADVANCE THE FORMAL REVIEW OF IT AS A AS A CONDITION -- I THINK WE WANT TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS TO SEE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. AND I THINK THAT IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST MANY MANY PEOPLE. HERE IN OUR STATE. SOMEHOW BRANDS THEM AS AND IN CAPABLE OF DOING COLLEGE LEVEL WORK. AND SO NOT ONLY DO I PRAISE YOU FOR ADVANCING THE STUDY BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT. OUR ACADEMICIANS AND PEOPLE SMARTER THAN ME. WILL UNDERSTAND THAT. YES IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO DIFFERENTIATE WHO CAN GET INTO COLLEGE. THE WAY TO DO IT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND HAVE. TIME. THANK YOU ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. GOOD VERY GOOD WHICH I TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU I THINK A THANK YOU SENATOR I GLAZER AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME AND FRANKLY IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. BUT THE TEST PREP INDUSTRY WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THERE IS AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THAT ASSET. AND CERTAIN PEOPLE WE HEARD FROM CARLOS MAYBE THEIR FAMILY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT -- HOW THE INFORMATION TO GET TEST BUT MAYBE THEY COULD BUY A TWENTY DOLLAR BOOK AT THE BOOKSTORE? AND THOSE AREN'T THE PREDICTORS OF SUCCESS YOU KNOW YOU CAN CERTAINLY USE GPA BUT ALSO LIKE TO DO IN TEXAS AND ACTUALLY DO AT THE UC. IS THE NEW ELSE PLAY THE LOCAL. SO IF YOU SUCCEED IN YOUR SCHOOL IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP 10% OF YOUR CLASS THAT SHOWS THE HAVE THE MOXIE AND HOSTILE TO SUCCEED. AND THAT'S JUST AS MUCH A PREDICTOR IS HOW YOU WILL DO AT UC SANTA CRUZ UC BERKELEY OR ANYWHERE. THEN THE ACT OR SAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO EVALUATE THIS ISN'T A CERTAINTY IT'S GONNA COME BACK WITH THE CONCLUSION -- BUT THE SOUL PUT THE LEGACY LEGISLATURE ON RECORD SAYING THAT WE THINK THERE ARE. TWO HIGHER ASSISTANCE OUGHT TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GLAZER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FOR A C. R. T. FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK CHAIN FOOD AXLE. TO AXLE AYE GLAZER. PLEASE THEIR AYE MCGUIRE CAN. ALL RIGHT WE'LL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL WILL NOW MOVED FILEITEM EIGHTEEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GET MY WITNESSES APPEAR. OKAY MADAM CHAIR A LEAVE IN SENATORS FIRST I WANT. TO THANK YOU AND YOUR GREAT STAFF HERE FOR WORKING WITH US OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WE CAN OVER THE THE HOLIDAY -- TO TO HELP GET THIS RIGHT ON THIS IS RELATED THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE INDUSTRY PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS WE HAVE HERE IN THE SENATE. AND THIS ONE REGARD IS RELATED TO THE RECRUITMENT PRACTICES -- FRANKLY SOMETIMES ON UNFORTUNATELY TARGETING STUDENTS FRANKLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS MARGINALIZE INDIVIDUALS ALMOST EVERY MAJOR SCANDAL IN THIS FIELD STARTED WITH THE SAME THING. THE SO CALLED A RECRUITER. THESE RECRUITERS ARE REALLY HIGH PRESSURE SALES PEOPLE TO GET BODIES ARE BUT IN THE SEAT -- FRANKLY SCAMMING STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS OUT OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- KINDA LIKE BOILER ROOM PRACTICES OF RIGHT NOW THE MOVIE BOILER ROOM. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT THESE RECRUITERS OFTEN TARGET SPECIFIC. INDIVIDUALS VETERANS TEENAGERS FIRST GENERATION INDIVIDUALS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THIS MEASURE WOULD CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES AND CURRENT LAW ALLOWING FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TO PROVIDE RECRUITERS WITH KICKBACKS INCENTIVES. AS PART OF THEIR AS PART OF THEIR COMPENSATION. CURRENT LAW ONLY PREVENTS KICKBACKS BY EMPLOYEES AND DOESN'T INCLUDE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THIS BILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. IN ADDITION CURRENT LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY PREVENT KICKBACKS BASED UPON AWARDS THE FINANCIAL LATE. THIS BILL ALSO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. SOME WILL SAY THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE ARGUE ADDRESSED BY FEDERAL LAW. AND THAT WE KNOW THAT ONLY THE US SECRETARY OF EDUCATION CURRENTLY BETSY TO BOSS CAN FORCE THIS AGREEMENT SO WE THINK WE ARE DO BETTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS. WE CAN'T -- LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT US FOR OUR CONSUMERS AND THEY FAIL TO DO SO MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BUY CODIFYING THIS IN THE STATE LAW. ALLOWING OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER. A MALICIOUS VIOLATORS. THIS BILL LIKE OUR PACKAGES SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF VETERANS CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS LABOR STUDENTS. ARE COMMUNICATED SYSTEM. AND OUR FOCUS ON PUTTING AN END TO THIS -- FRAUD AND ABUSE BY SOME IN THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY AND LET'S FACE IT NOT ALL FOR PROFITS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE WHO ARE. CAR MECHANICS -- WHO WORK IN THE IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD WHO GOT A GREAT CAREER IN THE FOR PROFIT HISTORY BUT THERE ARE SOME IN THERE? THAT ARE THAT ARE CAUSING A LOT OF DAMAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PREY UPON. THE VULNERABLE AND SELL IT OUT WITH ME TODAY WE THINK IS A IS A FAIR COMPROMISE I WILL NOTE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING. WITH THE OPPOSITION UP UNTIL TEN MINUTES AGO IN THE HALLWAY. WE ARE CERTAINLY -- I'VE CLOSER THAN WE WERE EARLIER TODAY AND WE WERE LAST WEEK AND THOSE ARE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS -- WE HAD A SET OF AMENDMENTS WAS PROPOSED BY THE INDUSTRY -- LAST WEEK WE TRY TO INCORPORATE THESE IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE WAY I DO WANT -- TO AGREED TO THE ALL THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY ANALYSIS OF THANK YOU. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES TRY TO COME TO EVEN STRONGER -- THE BILL BEFORE US HERE THIS YEAR ALSO WITH ME -- ARE INDIVIDUALS LIKE TESTIFIED SPORT THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ALL IT YOU CHOOSE WHO GOES FIRST TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THANK YOU. BOB CHAIRMAN -- MUST SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY SALES QUOTAS AND COMMISSIONS ARE A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF MOST COLLEGE OPERATIONS THAT END UP TURNING PREDATORY. THEY LEAVE STUDENTS WITHOUT A QUALITY EDUCATION AND WITH DEBTS THAT THOSE STUDENTS CANNOT REPAY. PAYING RECRUITERS FOR EACH ENROLLMENT INVITES ADVISORS WHO SHOULD BE ADVISING STUDENTS AND PROVIDING THEM WITH QUALITY INFORMATION. TO INSTEAD TARGET THE VULNERABLE AND TO AVOID PROVIDING THE AND INFORMATION THAT MIGHT DIRECTLY HIT TO THEIR OWN PAYCHECK. THAT'S WHY THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS COUNSELORS HAVE PROHIBITED THIS PRACTICE OR THEIR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO AND WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BANNED IT SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE FEDERAL BAN HOWEVER HAS BEEN UNSTABLE WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION CREATING A NEW SET OF LOOPHOLES AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. UNRELIABLE CALIFORNIA NEEDS ITS OWN BAND SO THEY CAN ENFORCE THE LAW INDEPENDENTLY. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE BILLS THAT NEED AND ADDRESSES SOME IMPORTANT LOOPHOLES WITH THE AMENDMENT WITH THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBING THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE BILL INCORPORATES MOST. MOST OF THE CHANGES REQUESTED BY OPPONENTS A FEW ISSUES REMAIN AND WE REMAIN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPONENTS TO SEE IF THEIR WAYS TO CLARIFY. BUT WITHOUT OPENING UP LARGE LOOPHOLES -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU I MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES. IT'S A CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN NON PROFITS AROUND CALIFORNIA THAT SIR VETERANS IN GREATEST NEED. HI THIS IS THE POPULATION OF VETERANS THAT SERVED US AND HAS RETURNED AND HAVE CHALLENGES SO WE WORK ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES VETERANS WE SERVE -- REALLY ARE AT IT SORT OF A BASIC LEVEL WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM OUT OF HOSPITALS AND INSTITUTIONS BUT MANY OTHERS. WE'RE TRYING TO GRADUATE TO GREATER LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE AND TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO WHAT HAPPENS OFTENTIMES IS WILLING COUNTER THESE VETERANS AND THEIR GI BENEFITS ARE GONE THEY'RE NOT EVEN AWARE THEY'RE GONE IN MANY INSTANCES AND THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION IS OFTEN TARGETED BY VERY AGGRESSIVE RECRUITING PRACTICES. THEY MIGHT SIGN AWAY THEIR J. BENEFITS NEVER HAVING ATTENDED A CLASS AND ONCE THAT BENEFIT IS GONE IS GONE AND WE HAVE TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO HELP THEM. THE THING FOR THAT A BY THIS COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT -- WE ARE OFTEN IMPLEMENTING GRANT PROGRAMS -- THROUGH A STATE MENTAL HEALTH GRANTS AND OTHER THINGS SO THOSE ARE INVESTMENTS WE THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE MADE I IN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE BOTH TO I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE BUT ALSO. TO ASSIST THEM IN BEING CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY -- IF THEY ARE VICTIMS OF VERY AGGRESSIVE TACTICS IN THIS REGARD. WHICH I THINK THIS BILL MAKES VERY REASONABLE -- CONSIDERATIONS IN ORDER TO REIN THAT IN -- THEN THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING SO APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANGELA PERRY WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION A STRONG SUPPORT. REALLY RESONATED WITH SK YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. I LANDED ON ON BEHALF OF NEXT IN CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. IRAN **** ON BEHALF OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE COLLEGE A CHANCE OFFICE IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER SUPPORT. FOR ANY OF THE BILL. IF WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE ROOM. WE'RE AT THE LITTLE TABLE NOW. ALL RIGHT TWO MINUTES EACH I'LL LET YOU DECIDE WHO BEGINS SURE. WHEN YOU'RE READY? AND I'M SURE MATH BACK REPRESENTING CAPS IN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR. I'M WE DID OFFER AMENDMENTS AFTER BMP COMMITTEE WE DID HAVE A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN. THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYMENT. TALKING ABOUT HOW WE PAY OUR EMPLOYEES WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR CONTRACTS. ON THESE AGAIN ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES THAT ARE VERY LEGAL ORIENTED WHERE YOU KNOW EVERY WORD DOES MATTER. SO IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THEY ACCEPTED A LOT OF OUR LANGUAGE. BUT SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PIECES THAT THAT MATTER TO US THEY DID NOT SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE STILL NEED TO RESOLVE IF WE ARE GOING TO COME TO A RESOLUTION. AND WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT. WE AGREE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF THE BILL RIGHT WE WE ARE NOT PAIN ARE EMPLOYEES OF BASED ON THESE QUOTAS IT'S AGAINST FEDERAL LAW IT'S AGAINST STATE LAW. OUR TITLE FOR ELIGIBILITY IS DEPENDENT ON SO THIS IS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND THEY MENTION THE PREVIOUS WITNESS MANSON BUSH AND TRUMP. IT WAS ACTUALLY OBAMA AND A BOMB IS ADMINISTRATION THAT SET THE CURRENT GUIDELINES. THE RELEASED THEIR RAGS AND THEY RELEASED A DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC. TO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN DO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN'T DO LOTS OF QUESTIONS LOTS OF EXAMPLES WE DO NOT HAVE THAT GUIDANCE IN THIS LAW. AND FOR THOSE WHO WORK WITH THE BUREAU I DOUBT WE WOULD GET THAT SORT OF GUIDANCE FROM THEM -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW FORGET REGULATIONS ON THAT SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATUTE IS SO CLEAR FOR US. BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS HOW WE'RE SETTING OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR EMPLOYEES THIS IS HOW WE'RE PAYING OUR EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE WORDS AND THE BILL NOW ARE VERY VAGUE AND WILL CAPTURE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED. IN THE ENROLLMENT FOR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THIS COULD BE THE ACCOUNTANTS THIS COULD BE THE LAWYERS THIS COULD BE THE RECEPTIONIST. THERE. WE INVOLVED BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THEY'RE NOT THE FRONT LINE THEY'RE NOT THE ONES TALKING TO THOSE STUDENTS BUT THE BILL IS WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT WE STILL BELIEVE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT TO CAPTURE THAT. THOSE OF YOU KNOW SORT OF AGAIN FUNDAMENTALLY WE AGREE WITH THE BILL WE'VE TRIED IN EARNEST TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND I BELIEVE WE STILL WILL. BUT AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND NEGOTIATED IN TEN MINUTES AGO OUT IN THE HALLWAY WE ARE STILL NOT THERE AND WE ARE STILL OPPOSED. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAURA BROWN ON BEHALF OF TO YOU AND ON BEHALF OF COURSE ERA IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE ARE ONLINE PROGRAM MANAGERS WHO WORK WITH NONTRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS. TO PROVIDE ONLINE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER OF THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND ALWAYS BEING AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS. WE HAD WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR TO SECURE AN EXEMPTION FOR A SMALL NARROW SUBSET OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NONPROFIT REGIONALLY ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS -- AND THAT BECAME A RESULT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE AUTHOR THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO AND CAPTURE THESE SCHOOLS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. IN WHAT WE DID WAS PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FOR THE SCHOOLS IN THE ARTICLES OF EXEMPTION FROM THE ACT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AN OVERSTAFFED -- BECAUSE THE SENATE BMP AND OF COURSE YOUR COMMITTEE ARE. THE ART LOOKING AT THOSE BIGGER ISSUES DURING SUNSET REVIEW. BUT OUR ISSUE SPECIFICALLY IS WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE FEDERAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ROLE WHICH ALLOWS FOR AN EXCEPTION FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS OUR PARTNER INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE REVENUE SHARE. AN ONLINE PROGRAM -- JUST BY WAY OF BRIEF BACKGROUND ALL pINSTITUTIONS WITH IN CALIFORNIA. ARE EXEMPT FROM THE ACT THOSE ARE LAW SCHOOLS AS YOU KNOW ALSO ALL NONPROFIT REGIONALLY ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA ARE EXEMPT FROM THE ACT. I EAT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LET'S SAY BUT AS SOON AS AN OUTSIDE NONPROFIT. HAS A BRANCH WITH IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN IRONIC SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT HIM FROM THE ACT. SO BY WAY OF REMOVAL OF THE FEDERAL AND SENT ROLE -- THOSE PARTICULAR SUBSET OF INSTANT. WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND NOT RULE WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT ONLINE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA SO JUST TO FURTHER ELIMINATE PEPPER DYING HERE WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL ROLE. SO WOULD COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FROM ITS NEW YORK. BASED RIGHT -- BUT IF THEY HAVE A BRANCH CAMPUS IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN THEY COULD NOT AND THAT WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN ONLINE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SO WE'RE JUST SEEKING. CLARITY AND TO CURE THAT ISSUE SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR INNOVATION INVESTMENT AND OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLINE AND NOT ARBITRARILY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE SUBSET OF SCHOOLS. THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR SCOTT GOVERNOR UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX IN OPPOSITION.

THANK THE WHOLE FOCUS WAS ON FOR PROFIT SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR ABOUT HOW WE HAVE NOW. LAST TO DAN HAVE GROUP THAT. BY ALL ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN GOOD ACTORS HAVE REGIONAL ACCREDITATION. WHY WHY IS THAT NOW PART OF THIS BILL? WELL IT IS CERTAINLY -- WAS -- CHANGED SINCE BEING A IT'S A IT'S A PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND AS NOTED ON THE ANALYSIS -- THEY DID RAISE THIS ISSUE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THEN YOU DOWN THE ROAD WITH THIS -- SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS TO TO FURTHER. ADDRESS THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT I A GOOD PLACE FOR THESE KINDS OF ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED AS IN SUNSET REVIEW WHICH WILL BEGIN IN THE FALL. AND CERTAINLY CARRY INTO NEXT YEAR BUT IT IS DOES THIS BILL INCORPORATE THAT. WELL I I THINK I WANT TO GO BACK -- TO MY OPPONENTS. NOT REALLY HAVE MORE POLITE. THE OPPOSITION'S -- TESTIMONY AND SHE SAID THAT WHEN THEY DRAFTED THE FIRST TRACK AND THAT MAYBE WAS A LITTLE TOO BROAD AND SO WE IT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AND HOPEFULLY WE GOT THIS COMMITTEE TODAY WILL GO THE PREPARATIONS AND SO. WE'RE GOING. TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT AND IF WE COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING WILL CERTAINLY SENT. OUT SENATE BACK -- TO COMMITTEE STAFF HERE THEN AND COMMITTEE TO SEE IF IT GETS ME. IF I COULD JUST ADD THE ON THE NONPROFIT EXEMPTION THAT WAS CLARIFIED. WAS -- ADDED HAD HAD BEEN ADDED IT WAS -- TAKEN OUT IN THE SENATE B. AND P. [inaudible] I COMMITTEE. TAKE IT OUT HERE BUT IT WAS FEEDBACK AT THAT AT THE COMMITTEE THAT YANKED IT OUT I THINK WE NEED TO END UP WE NEED WE GO SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN BECAUSE IT WAS TOO BROAD OF AN TO BROUGHT OF AN EXEMPTION. BUT I THINK THAT'S DOABLE AND I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR BROWN ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE. TO TO DO THAT [inaudible] OKAY. IS THIS THIS ISSUE A BUNDLED SERVICES CONTRACT. IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THEY ARE CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT'S A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE THAN. THESE FEW NONPROFIT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IT INVOLVES THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT IN BRAWL INVOLVES NON. NON POFITS MORE BROADLY AND SO IT SHOULD BE HANDLED IN THAT. IN THAT TERRITORY SO I IS I THINK I THINK THAT WE CAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS. BILL -- DELAYED THAT CONVERSATION I WITH A MORE NARROW AMENDMENT TO THEN HAD GONE TO THE THAT HAD BEEN IN THE BILL BEFORE -- OKAY WELL I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE ASKED TO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY. AND SO -- MY HEARING FROM THE AUTHOR. THAT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE. ON HOW THIS COMPENSATION IS -- IS WRITTEN THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONCERN WITH. WITHOUT THAT THAT THE LANGUAGE IS BEFORE US TODAY. THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN FULLY VETTED OUT AND I DON'T WANT TO INCLUDE. I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT INCLUDES. HE'S VERY REPUTABLE NONPROFITS THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE BAD APPLES THAT WE ALL WANT TO TRY TO GET OUT SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR IS. TO WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOING. FOR SURE AND AND THEN SHARED. AFTER I RESPOND HERE I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN ALLOW THE OPPOSITION TO FURTHER. DISCUSS HER SUGGESTION IS THAT -- WE HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO TO ATTEMPT. TO TO TO ADDRESS AND I REALIZE THAT. YOU HAD A DIRECTIVE FROM YOUR COMMITTEE HERE WERE AND ED CAME IN THERE KIND OF TOO LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT WE THINK THERE'S A CHANCE. TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE WE DO HAVE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND MIKE NAME IS OFF THE ONLY GO BACK TO YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE BEFORE WE TAKE IT OUT. DANCE ON THE SENATE FLOOR. AND RESERVE THE RIGHT -- TO TO YES NOT GET ARE SET FOR A MORE POORLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE TRY. TO HAVE A MEETING OF THE MINDS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. FOR YOU IF IT GETS OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS. FOR BRINGING UP ON THE FLOOR THE YOU'LL GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT I COMMITTEE AS TO WHETHER IT MEETS THAT OUR OUR TEST. YEAH AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. DO THAT BEFORE IT GOES THE FLOOR I KNOW OF IS GHOST APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT. YES AND SO ARE HAVE HOPE THAT OVER THIS -- BREAK WE GET USED TO WORK ON IT [inaudible] ENSURE. IF YOU WANT RESPOND TO BE FINE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTARY THANK YOU SENATOR. I THINK THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND HERE AND YOU YOU RAISE A VALID POINTS I DON'T THINK. OF CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HER LEYVA BUT I DON'T THINK THE INTENT HERE IS TO CAPTURE THE SMALL SUBSET OF THE INSTITUTIONS THIS IS A FOR PROFIT. A BILL PACKAGE MY MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO I MEAN M SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO HAVE A SMALL TO A NARROWER EXEMPTION WITH IN THE PROVISION IN WHICH WERE SPEAKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE FEDERAL RULE. SO THAT YOU WOULD USE YOU WOULD SAY THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS NONPROFIT REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED. BY THE FEDERAL RULE WHICH IS SUBDIVISION M. AND I THINK WE COULD WORK THROUGH THAT -- I I DO THINK THE ISSUE OF EXEMPTIONS I'M I CONCUR WE DIDN'T NEED TO OVERSTAFFED AND PUT THE EXEMPTION AND THE LARGER ARTICLES OF EXEMPTION. AND OBVIOUSLY -- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES TO DISCUSS DURING BOTH COMMITTEE SENSE THAT REVIEW I THINK THE IMMEDIATE. SUGGESTION AND I MAKING WOULD CURE THIS ISSUE FOR US. AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD FOR ME AS WELL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I HEAR FROM THE OUGHT NOT TODAY THAT HAS THAT. AS THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES YEAH AND THEN BIG PICTURE. YOUR ACCURATE THE GOAL OF THIS IS LOOKING AT THESE FOR PROFIT ENTITIES THAT DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS. OF OUR TAXPAYERS AND OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES AND SO. NONPROFIT. OUR OUR LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND SO WE WILL. ATTEMPT. TO EXCEPT IN A NUANCED SOLUTION IT'S RIGHT VERY GOOD ANYTHING ELSE FROM COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT. A SOME OF WHICH ARE TO CLOSE AS HE ARRIVED AT THE VERY GOOD TO HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER ALSO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM EIGHTEEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK CHANGE TO LASSELL. WHO DOES SO I GLAZER PLEASE THEIR AYE MCGUIRE PAN? WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM FIFTEEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. COME ON DOWN PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR SENATORS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY TODAY THIS BILL IS ALSO PART OF THE BILL PACKAGE. RESPONDING TO RECENT ACTIONS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY TO BOSS WHO HAD BEEN IN CRITICAL PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS VICTIMIZED BY PREDATORY COLLEGES THAT PRIORITIZED. PROFIT OVER STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM OVER PRICED INEFFECTIVE CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS BY PROVIDING ESSENTIAL DATA. TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC ON GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. THE ORIGINAL FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS AN ALL TOO COMMON STORY STE OF STUDENTS PROMISED BY RECRUITERS THAT THEY WILL FIND A JOB IN AN INDUSTRY TO TAKE OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LOANS. ONLY TO FIND UPON GRADUATING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET THE JOB THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY WHAT. THERE THAN ON EMPLOYER UNDER EMPLOYED BUT STILL FACE ASTRONOMICAL DEBT REPAYMENT. BASED ON INITIAL DATA FROM THE FEDERAL EDUCATION APARTMENT OVER TO A FIFTY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FAILED THIS TEST. THESE PROGRAMS GRADUATED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO LEFT SCHOOL WITH CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. SCRAPPING THE ROLE -- WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED -- TWO WEEKS AGO UNDER THE DIRECTION OF BACK TO THE BOSS THROUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HAS ELIMINATED A CRITICAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON THE WAGES STUDENTS AREN'T AFTER GRADUATING. IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS DATA. THERE'S ONLY BEEN UNRELIABLE ALUMNI SURVEY DATA THAT WE HAVE. AS AMENDED IN SENATE BMP THIS BILL WILL TAKE A MAJOR STEP NO ACTUALLY THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER GLAZER. THIS BILL WILL TAKE A MAJOR STEP TOWARD MAKING FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AROUND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT BY CLOSING THE GAP IN OUR STATE OUTCOME DATA. BY CREATING A PROCESS FOR A WAGE DATA MATCH WITH EDT THIS DATA WILL BE AGGREGATED BY PROGRAM AND BY INSTITUTION AND POSTED IN A DATABASE FOR THE PUBLIC. TO HELP SHED LIGHT ON THE ACTUAL WAGES THAT STUDENTS GAIN AND ALLOW AGAIN PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS A PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS SO WITH THAT WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS ARE. MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS ANGELA PERRY I'M A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS AND I'M HERE TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTEEN FORTY WHICH WOULD MAKE RELIABLE VERIFIED OUTCOMES DATA FROM FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS TAXPAYERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE FIRST TIME. STUDENTS A PRIVATE COLLEGES OR IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT HAD ACCESS TO RELIABLE OR VERIFY DATA ON THEIR EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. MANY STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO NO DATA AT ALL AND THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE IS UNRELIABLE AND INCOMPLETE. THIS MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE INVESTMENT THEY ARE MAKING WHEN THEY ND ROLL AND TO MANY BAD ACTORS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS TO PREY UPON STUDENTS OF COLOR. FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS FOSTER KIDS SINGLE MOTHERS AND VETERANS. THIS LACK OF DATA ALSO LEAVES POLICYMAKERS WITHOUT THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. ALL THREE OF THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS HAVE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OUTCOMES DATA FOR THEIR GRADUATION FOR THEIR GRADUATES CREATED THROUGH AN IDENTICAL DATA MATCH WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. AND IS PLANS DEVELOPED TO CREATE A STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT EDT DATA WILL LSO PROVIDE THE WORK FORCE OUTCOME FOR ANY LONGITUDINAL SYSTEM. AB THIRTEEN FORTY REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT EDT DATA AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AS WELL. I WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INCORPORATE THOSE STUDENTS INTO THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM AS IT DEVELOPS. AB THIRTEEN FORTIES MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS OF STREAMLINED THE BILL WHILE STILL PRESERVING THIS IS CENTRAL DATA MATCH ENSURING THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCURATE DATA. EVEN AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN WITHHOLDING INFORMATION AND ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS BOB SHERMAN WITH THE CENTURY FOUNDATION ALSO SUPPORTING -- AB THIRTEEN FORTY AS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP FOR THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND A VETERAN IN STRONG SUPPORT. REALLY RESONATE WITH SK YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. I'LL HAVE ANOTHER ON REPRESENT NEXT IN CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. IMAGES BUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CALL CHANCE OFFICE IN SUPPORT. THANKS THIRTIES AT WOODLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORT. SIR ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SEEING [inaudible] ONE DOWN. YOU MIGHT LEARN REPRESENTING A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY THE AMENDMENTS -- LOOK GOOD TO US WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO REVIEW THEM THANK YOU SO MUCH TERRIFIC. ANY OPPOSITION SEEING AND HEARING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER GLAZER. THANKS YOU'RE LEVERAGES THE THANK YOU AGAIN THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA THIS IS A TERRIFIC BILL. AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT CORPORATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHICH I CLOSE SORT OF THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND MISTER GLAZER FOR YOUR WORK WITH US ON THIS -- I'LL SAY TO FINAL THINGS -- THIS BILL IS AROUND DATA IT'S AROUND TRANSPARENCY AS THE OLD SAYING GO. SUNSHINE IS BEST DISINFECTANT OUR HOPE IS A STATE WILL SHED LIGHT ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND OUR HOPE IS ONCE WE HAVE THE STATE WE CAN DETERMINE NEXT STEPS. TO FOR THE PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GLAZER I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FIFTEEN A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILL CHANGE TO WRESTLE. WITH US SO I A GLAZER PLEASE ARE AYE MCGUIRE PAN. VERY GOOD WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL A CALL AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE PRESENTING ITEM NUMBER. SEVENTEEN NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF OUR DAYS ARE BECAUSE YES -- THIS MEASURE BERMAN THAT IS NOT BAD GLAD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO CELEBRATE MEMBER BERMAN IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I CAN READ MY NOTES. WELCOME YOU ARE THE PROJECT START WITH YOUR OWN ITEM FILE ITEM SIXTEEN I WOULD LOVE TO EXCELLENT SIR AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU OF AN INSURANCE SANDERS. SB THIRTY FORTY ONE WOULD PREVENT. COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES FROM INVADING STATE OVERSIGHT. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INSTITUTION THAT CLAIMS TO BE A NONPROFIT COLLEGE IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AS A NON PROFIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING AN EXEMPTION. FROM STATE OVERSIGHT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THE APPROPRIATE ARBITER GIVEN ITS EXISTING ROLE IN REVIEWING NONPROFIT STATUS OF OTHER ENTITIES. WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED IN THE SENATE AND WOULD ONLY FOCUS ON NONPROFIT COLLEGES THAT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED AS A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TEN SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE NONPROFIT IS ARE CERTAINLY USE A NONPROFIT LABEL. MISLEADING STUDENTS ALL THE SAME TIME DODGING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM. RECLINING ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS BY THE FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. IS ALLOWING SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TO GET AWAY WITH USING COMPLICATED FINANCIAL SCHEMES AND SHELL CORPORATIONS TO LAY CLAIM TO NONPROFIT STATUS. THIS EMERGING PROBLEM IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INCORPORATED IS A FOR PROFIT COMPANY TRADED ON NASDAQ. THEY CREATED AT GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY AND CLAIM IT IS A NONPROFIT COLLEGE. HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF THE NONPROFIT GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY IS ALSO THE CEO OF THE FOR PROFIT GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INC. IN ABOUT 60% OF THE TUITION REVENUE AT THE NONPROFIT COLLEGE RECEIVES FLOWS THROUGH TO THE FOR PROFIT COMPANY. AS GEORGETOWN LAW PROFESSOR IN NONPROFIT LAW EXPERT BRIAN GALLEY SAID. THE NONPROFIT IS ESSENTIALLY A TRUSTWORTHY LOOKING WRAPPER AROUND A FOR PROFIT BUSINESS. THE ARANGEMENT MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE CONCEPT OF A NONPROFIT. WITHOUT AN OBJECTIVE CHECK ON THE NONPROFIT CLEAN THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO MISLEAD STUDENTS AND AVOID APPROPRIATE STATE OVERSIGHT. IN FACT OTHER COLLEGES ARE ALREADY FOLLOWING GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITIES EXAMPLE IN CLAIMING NONPROFIT STATUS. THEREFORE CALIFORNIA MUST STEP UP AND STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS FOR COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO CLARIFY HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD PROVIDE NOTICE TO AN INSTITUTION. IN THE BUREAU FOR PART FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION OF THE DETERMINATION AND WANT TO THANK THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE -- ENSURE GLAZER OF THAT COMMITTEE FOR THE SUGGEST A CLARIFICATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WHEN THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF LIKE A GEYSER FLIPPING SEE. MAKE SURE. YES INDIVIDUAL DIVERSITY I LIKE. HE'LL BE BOB CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH. ASIAN -- SO BOTH CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL LAW HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED THE NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE BUILT IN RESTRICTIONS AND STRUCTURES THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS. NONPROFITS MUST USE ALL OF THEIR REVENUE FOR EDUCATIONAL AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES AND NO ONE IN A POSITION OF AUTHORITY IS ALLOWED TO EXTRACT FUNDS IN THE WAY THE FOR PROFIT OWNERS DO. IT ALTERS THE INCENTIVES AND THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR FUNDAMENTAL. HOWEVER THE INTEGRITY OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IS BEING THREATENED BY A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AB THIRTY FORTY ONE TRIGGERS A REVIEW FOR CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY PURPOSES OF COLLEGES -- OF THOSE COLLEGES THAT HAVE CLAIMED. THAT HAVE THAT HAVE CONVERTED TO NONPROFIT STATUS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INDEPENDENT AND THE WAY THAT THEY ARE GOVERNED AND FINANCE. AS IN MOST STATES ARE TURNING GENERAL OFFICE IS THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY FOR CHARITABLE ENTITIES WITH DIVISIONS DEDICATED BOTH TO THAT PURPOSE AND TO RELIEVE THE RELATED CONSUMER PROTECTION RESPONSIBILITIES. SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE FEDERAL THE BE -- FRANCHISE TAX BOARD COULD BE ANOTHER PLACE FOR THIS ROLE WELL THE FRANCHISE TAX OR DOES HAVE AN EYE ON NON PROFITS. TAX PURPOSES THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES HERE MAKE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AN APPROPRIATE AGENCY FOR THIS RESPONSIBILITY ALONG WITH OF COURSE. FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. COURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS -- ANGELA PERRY WITH THE ISSUE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO EXERCISE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY OF NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS PUTS CALIFORNIANS AT RISK AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WOULD PREVENT THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS RENOVATING STATE OVERSIGHT AND DECEIVING STUDENTS. WE ARE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. REALLY RESONATE WITH ESCAPE CALIFORNIANS. FOR I'LL HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER PERCENT NEXT IN CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. I AM VERY SORRY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FASTEN SAID ROLLING. OKAY. ROOM AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M TRYING TO KEEP [inaudible] THANK YOU. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER HALF OF ASHFORD UNIVERSITY -- WHILE WE AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THE ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY I WAS THAT SOME IN THE REFERENCE TO SOME OTHERS THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THEY SHOULD LOOK AT THIS WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE -- SENATOR GLAZER MADE THAT VERY CLEAR LAST WEEK. IT IN OUR HEARING -- BUT WE WOULD LKE TO AT LEAST HAVE SOME ACCESS TO TO THE COURTS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. I THINK -- WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT POSSIBLY BE AMENDED TO PERMIT INSTITUTIONS TO SEEK DIRECT APPROVAL FROM THE COURTS. WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR REVIEW BY THE AG OF OTHER SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES BY NOT FOR PROFIT SUCH AS A CELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE ASSETS -- UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE OUR LEGAL COUNSEL WITH US TODAY BUT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE SOME RECOURSE. TO IN ADDITION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR POST ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEW AND HIS DECISION. TO SEEK SOME SORT OF REDRESS THANK YOU. KATHY VAN AUSTIN MBM STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE SOVIET SO -- CERTAINLY ECHO -- GEORGE MILLER'S COMMENTS -- WE AGREE WE SHARED THE INTEREST AND AND SEEKING APPROVAL FROM -- SEE AT HAVE TO BE. UNDERSTAND IT'S PROBABLY NOT A POSSIBILITY -- SO THEREFORE I SOME SORT OF REDRESS TO THE COURT. OF WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL -- AND SO WE CERTAINLY. ENDORSE THAT REQUEST AND STANDS STRONGLY BEHIND IT. AND WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN AMENDMENT THAT DEALS WITH THE THE TERM CORE FUNCTION -- WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CHANGE TO AN INHERENTLY ACADEMIC FUNCTION IN THE BILL AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS THAT RIGHT STRENGTHENS -- THE INTENT OF THE BILL IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPE OF I FUNCTIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE. I. T. FUNCTIONS THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE ACADEMIC FUNCTION SO I THINK THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SEPARATING OUT THE TO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SO WITH. SERBIA WOULD BE HAPPY TO REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR STAFF'S BEEN GREAT. EXCELLENT THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. CENTER DRAWS YES JUST IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF OTHER RECOURSE BESIDES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST THAT I'VE HEARD OF THAT BUT I WILL ADMIT THAT I MISSED -- THE HE AND ANOTHER SOMETHING OVER COVER THAT FOR ME WHILE I WAS HAVING A CROWN. BUT IT'S A HABIT IT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT -- AND AND TALK WITH THE THE FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. SEE THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE HAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN YEAH. VERY GOOD CENTER GLAZER. YEAH I WAS AT THE HEARING AND THEN THIS IDEA DIDN'T COME UP SO THIS IS A NEW IDEA. ABOUT A FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WOULD JUST ECHO. MY COLLEAGUE SAID I REQUEST FOR YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF YOU THINK IT WOULD DIE. THIS OF THE BECOME AWARE AND HAVE AND I'D LOVE TO GET FEEDBACK HAVE A TAKE A LOOK. AT THE EVIDENCE OF THE BILL. OKAY VERY GOOD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHICH LIKE A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER RESPECT THIS RUBBLE VERY GOOD THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GLAZER MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM SIXTEEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA I BELIEVE THAT I WILL. CHANGE. SOMETIMES MODESTO I'D GLAZER PLEASE ARE AYE MCGUIRE PAN. THE BILL HAS BEEN OPPOSED TO GET OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON I WAS TRYING TO GIVE AWAY YOUR DUTIES A LITTLE WHILE IT. I'M GLAD YOU ARE HERE TO PRESENT ITEM SEVENTEEN AB -- THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BEAR QUE HOT SO PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN SINCE THE SUMMER. BEGAN WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PRESENT MY BILL AND BE IN P. -- THAT DIED AND I'M RETURNING THE FAVOR -- LIKE THAT HOPE WORK HOPEFULLY I'M AS SUCCESSFUL AS SHE WAS. NOT MY BILL. MENTIONED CENTERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE SOMETHING OVER POWER CAN. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO SAFEGUARD THE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ENROLLED ONLINE AT FOR PROFIT OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. THE LARGEST SHARE OF CALIFORNIANS AND ROLLED ONLINE AT SCHOOLS AND OTHER STATES AREN'T ROLLED IN FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLED BUSINESS SECTORS TODAY. ONLINE OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS AT AND ROLL CALIFORNIANS HAVE WORSE STUDENT. LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE TOOK STEPS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM POSSIBLE PREDATORY OUT OF STATE ONLINE BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRING THEM TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU OF POST SECONDARY PRIVATE EDUCATION. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW APPLIES ONLY TO SCHOOLS PHYSICALLY LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA NOT INSTITUTIONS BASED OUT OF STATE THAT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ONLINE. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR EXTENDS ALL THESE REFORMS IN CURRENT LAW AND EXTENDS THESE PROTECTIONS TO STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO ENROLL IN ONLINE. OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR OUT OF STATE SCHOOLS. BUT NO WAY FOR THE STATE TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AT THE SCHOOLS OR REMOVE THE ABILITY TO ENROLL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AT A SCHOOL WHICH MAY POSE A RISK TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU WHICH MIGHT SIGNAL THAT THERE'S REASON FOR CONCERN. INCLUDING PENDING INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS AS WELL AS ACCREDITATION ISSUES. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE THESE DISCLOSURES AND ADDITIONALLY OFFER A COMPLIANT PROCESS EXCUSE ME COMPLAIN PROCESS. FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AS WELL AS AS CREATE KEY ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. I WILL CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN STUDENTS ENROLLED AT IN STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO ENROLL ONLINE AND PROGRAMS LOCATED OUT OF STATE. AND WITH ME TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS ANGELA PERRY POLICY ANALYST FOR THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. THANK YOU WELCOME BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I WILL START WITH THE FACT THAT WELL WELL SOME HOPE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN HELP MORE STUDENTS -- NOT COLLEGE DEGREES THE PROMISE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION ALSO HAS PERILS. THE CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING ACADEMIC RIGOR AND STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS CAN BE EVEN GREATER THAN IN TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OVER PRICED AND POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS LEAVING STUDENTS WITH AN AFFORDABLE DEBT. AS YOU HEARD THERE ARE NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ENROLLED ONLINE IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE LOCATED OUT OF STATE. AND THE LARGER SHARE OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE A FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WERE STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO END UP WITH THE DEBT THEY CANNOT REPAY. COMING IN LIKE A HURRICANE. THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW THAT THERE IS REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT IN ROLE CALIFORNIANS ONLINE HAVE A WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES. THAN TO CALIFORNIA BASED ONLINE PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WITH PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF MANY LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THESE LAWS HAVE TRADITIONALLY ONLY APPLIED TO THE STUDENTS. IT'S A IN SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S BORDERS NOT TO SCHOOLS IN ROLLING CALIFORNIANS BUT BASED ELSEWHERE. CALIFORNIA TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY REQUIRING OUT OF STATE COLLEGES TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE EXISTING REGISTRATION SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM THREE KEY FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS. FIRST THE STATE LACKS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO IDENTIFY REST TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SECOND THE STATE LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO REVOKE A SCHOOLS REGISTRATION IF THE RISK IF RISKS TO STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED. AND THIRD OF THE SYSTEM LACKS A COMPLAINT PROCESS MEANING STUDENTS HAVE NO WAY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES TO THE BUREAU PROACTIVELY. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WOULD TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS EACH OF THESE ISSUES AND OFFER BETTER PROTECTION TO STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONLINE OUT OF STATE PROGRAMS. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE HI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AROUND THE HAVE A CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY GARLIC IN KATE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT.

FILE ITEM TWENTY THREE ACA FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ WELCOME BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AC FOURTEEN IT'S SIMPLY A RESOLUTION THAT ASKED VOTERS WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS WHO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES AT THE UC. ARE FOR THE SAME EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS AS YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. BEYOND PROVIDING WORLD CLASS INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH IT IT'S CAMPUS MEDICAL CENTERS THE UC IS THE STATE'S THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN AS AN ANCHOR IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. IN RECENT YEARS THE UC HAS OUTSOURCING ESTIMATED SEVEN THOUSAND SUPPORT JOBS WHILE THE SAME TIME INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGHLY PAID ADMINISTRATORS TO APPROXIMATELY. EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIS RESULT IN ANNUAL A MYSTERY PAYROLL COST INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THIS MATCHES THE MAIL THE UC HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED WOULD COST OFFER OUTSOURCED WORKERS A FULL PROTECTIONS AND EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS ENJOYED BY THE UC EMPLOYEES. ACA FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE FROM THE POLICIES THAT PRODUCE ECONOMIC RACIAL AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RELATED TO THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY TO HANDLE EITHER MEDICAL EMERGENCIES OR UNANTICIPATED NEEDS ANYWHERE IN THE UC SYSTEM. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT INCORPORATE UC'S CURRENT POLICIES FOR THE USE OF TEMPORARY PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. TO BE CLEAR NEITHER THE LEGISLATURE NOR THE GOVERNOR CAN ADDRESS A SYSTEMATIC INEQUITIES THAT OCCUR DUE TO UC'S AUTONOMY UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER ARTICLE TO THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLOW VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE. I SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU ALLOW THE VOTERS DECIDE WHETHER LOW INCOME SERVICE WORKERS AT THE UC. THOSEWHO CLEAN THE TOILETS MOW THE LAWN SERVE OUR FOOD AND CLEAN CLEAN THE BED HANDS SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME STANDARDS ENJOYED. ARE YOU SEE EMPLOYEES DOING THE EXACT SAME WORK. I'VE WITNESSES HERE TODAY. THANK YOU CAN WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD AFTERNOON. CAPTION WEINBERGER PRESIDENT OF APPS ME. THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE THE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT AN ACA. FOURTEEN ARE CLEANING TOILETS AND TING BED PANS PICKING UP TRASH. THERE COOKING THE FOOD MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS SUPPORTING DOCTORS. FACULTY NURSES STUDENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS. FIRST THE ACA APPLIES AT THE EXPIRATION OR RENEWAL OF EXISTING CONTRACTS. SO THAT MEANS THERE IS A BUILT IN PHASE IN PERIOD FOR UP TO TEN YEARS [inaudible] SECOND. NOTHING IN THE ACA REQUIRES THE UC TO HIRE THE SAME NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. OR ANY SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXCEPTIONS FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCY NEEDS THE SECOND AMENDMENT ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ECA IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM UC'S CURRENT POLICY. IT IS A BROAD EXEMPTION FOR PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES AND GIVES YOU SEE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS ANY ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM. TEMPORARY STAFFING NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM CLEANINGS STUDENT DORMS TO CLEANING A MEDICAL PATIENTS BUT PAN. FINALLY BECAUSE NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE POWER TO ENSURE SUPPORT SERVICES WORKERS ARE TREATED EQUALLY. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER YOU EXERCISE YOUR ARTICLE TWO POWERS. TO PLACE ON THE BALLOT FOR YOUR VOTERS TO DECIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS QUITE A PER PRODUCT IS HERE TO ANSWER POTENTIAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WELCOME TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE THIS TIME.

THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I CAN MAKE LITTLE WOMEN A FRIEND. THANK YOU. FOR IN THE SMALL ROOM RIGHT NOW. AT THE SMALL TABLE [inaudible] WELCOME. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MINUTES EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE NEED. TO PROVIDE FOR A FLEXIBLE OF A BLAND APPROPRIATE BLEND OF IN HOUSE STAFF AND CONTRACTORS STAFF WOULD TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY THINK IT'S A SHOWN. IN TERMS OF OUR INTEREST ENSURING THAT ARE LOWER WAGE WORKERS PARTICULARLY CONTRACT WORKERS. EARN A FAIR WAGE. IN FACT THAT AND PRESENT APARTADO ANNOUNCED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE FAIR WAGE FOR WORK PROGRAM WHICH BY THE FIFTY DOLLAR PER HOUR. MINIMUM WAGE IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- AS WE'VE ALSO MENTIONED IN OUR PAST TESTIMONY -- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS HAD IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS FOR MANY YEARS. REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTRACT OUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS AS CONTRACT OUT ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CERTAIN TYPES OF SPECIALIZED SERVICES. SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT ARE REQUIRED OR IN CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THE SERVICES ARE TAKING PLACE. TEN MILES AWAY FROM CAMPUS OR THE MEDICAL CENTER AND SO FORTH -- AGAIN THESE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE. WHERE DODD TRIMMING TREES OR WASHING WINDOWS ABOVE THE FIRST FLOOR AND SO FORTH REQUIRES SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT THAT WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T? MAINTAIN WE DON'T -- HAVE PURCHASED ON ON CAMPUS. HEY A ONE SPEAK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE THE NOTION IS EXPRESSED IN THE PAST ABOUT THE NOTION OF DISPLACEMENT AND HOW THE UNIVERSITY IS. SHEDDING WORKERS AND STAFF I WOULD NOTE IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED IT NOTED THAT. IN FACT OUR DATA ON REPRESENTS STAFF INCLUDING STAFFERS AND BY ASKED ME HAS SHOWN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THOSE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN. WAS NUMBERS HAVE GROWN FOR ASKING WORKERS BY 17% IN FACT. AND SO IT IS THE CASE THAT THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS IN HOUSE ON HER. ARE NORMALLY -- NOT DECLINING THE GROWING AS WELL. I'VE ALSO -- HURTING COMMITTEE TODAY THIS NOTION THAT. THE UNIVERSITY'S AUTONOMY PREVENTS -- THE LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR FROM ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE ABSENT IN A CA. I WANT TO MENTION I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY ACCURATE IN FACT THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR THAT ASK ME IS BROUGHT THIS TYPE OF BILL THIS TYPE OF EFFORT FORWARD. EACH OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS INCLUDING THREE YEARS OF BILLS BY CENTER LARA AND THE BILL LAST YEAR BY MISS WEBER. UNIVERSITY HAS STATED VERY CLEARLY THAT IF THE BILLS WERE TO PASS THESE ARE BILLS THAT AFFECTED THE UNIVERSITY OF PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE. THAT THOSE WOULD IMPACT UNIVERSITY DIRECTLY AND WE WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BEHAVE IN THE WAY THAT THOSE BILLS WERE OTHERWISE PRECLUDING US FROM. TO THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER ABOUT THIS BEING A ALONG PHASE AND THE A. C. A. B. ALONG PHASE AND I THINK THERE'S A MISNOMER THAT SOMEHOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF TEN YEAR CONTRACTS. AND IT TO EXTEND THE DAC WERE TO PASS WOULD BE A TEN YEAR GRADUATED PHASE AND I ALSO DISAGREE THAT THAT'S THE CASE I THINK THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TYPICALLY HAS TWO AND THREE YEAR CONTRACTS. AND AS WE READ THE THE LANGUAGE OF ACA FOURTEEN IT SUGGESTS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACA WOULD TAKE EFFECT AT THE EARLY STATE UPON WHICH I THE CONTRACT EXPIRES. OR WHEN THE CONTRACT COULD BE AMENDED. THE CONTRACT COULD BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME SO IN OUR MINDS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST EIGHT THIS IS A C. WERE TAKE AFFECT. THOSE CONTRACTS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF THIS A CA AS WELL. AND THEN LASTLY -- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FISCAL FOR A MOMENT I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT OUR LETTER HAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FISCAL ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF THIS A CA WERE TO PASS. JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IS THE EFFECT OF BOTH THE WAGE -- PREMIUM AND THE BENEFIT PREMIUM THAT THE UNIVERSITY BE REQUIRED TO COVER IN THE EVENT THAT WE HAD TO BRING THIS WORK IN HOUSE IS -- CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE LANGUAGE A CA DOES NOT SAY WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SAME NUMBERS WORKERS IF THE AC WERE TO PASS AS WE HAVE NOW ON CONTACTED STATUS. BUT THE FACT IS THE WORK DOES NEED TO BE DONE AND WE DO EXPECT TO BRING ON EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED -- IF THE AC OR TO PASS SO WITHOUT I WANTED TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM YOU SEE HEALTH. HE USED UP ALMOST ALL YOUR TIME YOUR ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONDS. A QUICKLY GREAT NAME IS ANGELA KELLY ITEM THAT STATE POLICY DIRECTOR. FOR ARE YOU SEE HOW -- AND IT JUST DIDN'T SHORT. THE LIMITATIONS THAT A CA -- IT WOULD IMPACT WOULD IMPACT -- PATIENT CARE -- THERE'S AN AMENDMENT IN THE BILL AND WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY THAT PER DIEM WORKERS CAN BE USED PRETTY AND WORKERS ARE WORKERS THAT. ARE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES BUT THEY'RE ALSO EMPLOYED AT OTHER PLACES SO WHEN WE CALL A PER DIEM WORKER TO COME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM SHE OR HE CAN SAY I HAVE IT'S SHIFTED SATTAR KAISER MERCY. OTHER HOSPITALS AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE SO WHAT IT IS IT IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION IT IS NOT. IT IT'S IT'S A SOLUTION WE WE WE USE -- AS A PRIORITY OVER CONTRACT WORKERS AND IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT SO WE HAVE AN AVERAGE NUMBER VAGUE VACANCIES AT THE UNIVERSITY THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FILL SO I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PERFECT THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. TURKEY SCENE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE AND WHERE POST. KELLY BROOKS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS WERE ALSO OPPOSED. MAURICE RICHARDSON -- REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH ASSOCIATION WE ALSO OPPOSE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SEE NO OTHER OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. BEFORE WE GO OPEN OF THE COMMITTEE I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. WELL THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT. THE AUTHOR AS A CHAMPION FOR WORKERS IN AND I THINK THAT'S THE HEART OF WHY SHE'S BRINGING THIS TO US AND I APPRECIATED ADMIRE YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT. AND YOU KNOW FOR ME THIS IS A NUCLEAR OPTION IN MANY WAYS AND SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. WHAT AT WHAT STEPS HAVE GOT HAVE HAVE? THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THIS GONE THROUGH WITHIN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. THIS IS BEEN A SUBJECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ASSISTANCE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN AGENDAS BY THE REGENTS AND IF SO HOW HAVE THEY ACTED I APPRECIATE THAT A LIMITATION. AND IF IT'S OKAY I'LL I'LL DEFER TO CATHERINE WHO. HAS HIS LIVED EVERY MOMENT OF THIS. AS HAS BEEN RAISED THERE WERE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS -- TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE LEGISLATIVELY THOSE WERE ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THIS IS AN EFFORT TO ACTUALLY BRING THIS PUBLIC INSTITUTION IN LINE WITH SISTER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. MY QUESTION IS IS THIS A MATTER IS AT THAT AND DISCUSSED IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH THE WITH YOU SEE. THIS IS A CONCERN FOR WORKERS AT UC HOWEVER THE ACA IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY IT IS DIFFERENT FROM AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO PRIVATE PARTIES. RIGHT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT BEFORE PULLING THE TRIGGER ON AN ACA. WHAT IS THE PROCESS THAT'S GONE FORTH WITHIN THE INSTITUTION ITSELF TO JUSTIFY THIS TYPE OF ACTION? NO YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION ALTHOUGH YOU NEED US TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT. REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THE SUBJECT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LET'S START THERE. IN THE UC SYSTEM. THERE ISN'T EFFORTS -- TO ADDRESS THIS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S EFFORTS. LEGISLATIVELY AND REPEATED CALLS FROM WORKERS AT THE UNIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY AN EXPANSION. OF A CONTRACTING OF THIS WORK SO WE HAVE SEEN ACTUALLY MORE OUTSOURCING. OF THIS WORK NOT LESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MY QUESTION IS IS THIS A MATTER THAT'S BEEN SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. THIS IS A CONCERN IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND ACT AND DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY WITHIN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO REACH THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ABOUT OUTSOURCING. THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH A PUBLIC POLICY THAT ENSURES THAT PEOPLE ARE TREATED EQUAL AT THE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS. WHAT THIS IS? I THINK IN IN FOR CLARIFICATION SO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS GOING TO DETERMINE THE WORKERS AT THE UNIVERSITY ALREADY THIS DOESN'T TOUCH THE WORKERS -- AND IN THE APPS ME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT IT TOUCHES WORKERS THAT DON'T HAVE A UNION WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES IT MORE CLEAR. AND SO THAT GOES BEYOND THE THE THE SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR IT ASKED ME THIRTY TO NINETY NINE WORKERS. OKAY SO CONTRACTING OUT IS NOT AN S. AND SUBJECT OF THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITHIN YOUR DISTINCT -- UNIONIZED WORKFORCE THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING THEN. WE HAVE AND WE DO RAISE THE CONCERN OF CONTRACTING OUT IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. THAT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM THE CONCERNED WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE WHICH IS CREATING AS A MATTER OF POLICY PUBLIC POLICY. THAT CAN EXTEND. FOR GENERATIONS. THAT THOSE DOING THE SAME WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY BE TREATED EQUAL. OKAY LET ME TRY THANK YOU THAT THAT HELPS ME THERE AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT. THERE'S A BOARD OF REGENTS THAT TOUGH SETS POLICY FOR THE FOR THE INSTITUTION. HAVE YOU HAS THIS BEEN A JAN DIES AMONG THE REGION'S OR DISCUSSION AND THEIR PUBLIC POLICY DECISION MAKING OF THIS THAT HAPPENED WITHIN THE THEN YOU WERE SU CALIFORNIA. MANAGER CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION PLEASE -- MISTER GLAZER -- YES THE ANSWER IS YES WE D HAVE A NEW BOARD CHAIR A REGION JOHN PEREZ WHO TOOK A AFFECT JUST A FEW DAYS AGO AND WE HAVE A CHEN DIES AT THE JULY. MEETING THE REGION'S A CONVERSATION IS QUESTION ITEM ABOUT PRINCIPLES -- SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROPERLY CONTRACT OUT. I IF I MAY ALSO GO BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION I WOULD STATE VERY CLEARLY THAT -- DISCUSSION AROUND AND AND ISSUES AROUND CONTRACTING OUT ARE CLEARLY AND SQUARELY BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW AT THE BARGAINING TABLE TING UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND ASKED ME. IF I WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE KIND OF THE THREE BROAD AREAS OF DISCUSSION WITHIN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OF DESCRIBING HIS WAGES. RETIREMENT AND CONTRACTING OUT LANGUAGE AND CLEARLY AS I WAS A TESTING TO EARLIER -- OUR PAST AGREEMENTS WITH ASKED ME HAVE CONTAINED ARTICLES WITHIN THE CONTRACT THIS SPEAK TO CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN CONTRACT OUT. THOSE WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DESCRIBED EARLIER ABOUT -- NOT SOLELY SAVE MONEY BUT IN THE CASES WHERE HE SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT SPECIALLY SERVICES AND SO FORTH. SO THOSE ISSUES AGAIN ARE ARE BEING DISCUSSED WE'VE TRADED LANGUAGE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TRADE LANGUAGE WITH ASKED ME. IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONVERSATION AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK OR TWO ABOUT JUST WHAT THAT PARTICULAR LANGUAGE WOULD LOOK LIKE. THE AMOUNT OF LANGUAGE IN THE LAST -- CONTRACTING. SELECT BARGAIN AGREEMENT WAS TWO OR THREE PAGES OF MATERIAL RELATIVE TO CONTRACTING OUT TERMS AND OBLIGATIONS AND SO. THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AS WELL. CAN I ADD TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING AND I'M NOT INVOLVED IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OF OF THIS UNION -- I WILL SAY LIKE ANYTHING TWELVE YEARS AGO I WAS ARRESTED AT A UC REGENTS MEETING BECAUSE WE WERE FIGHTING FOR THIRTY TO NINETY NINE WORKERS WHO -- WE'RE FIGHTING CONTRACT -- SO HAS IT BEEN BROUGHT UP YES IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP FOR WELL OVER A DECADE AT THE UC REGENTS -- IN THE MEANTIME THEY CONTINUE TO APPROVE CONTRACTS OF OF MASS -- AT CONTRACTING OUT SO -- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A CHEN DIES BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT'S EIGHT CONDITION OR OR SOMETHING THAT IS BROUGHT UP IN AND THIS IS IN PRODUCT AND COLLECT PART WHAT'S BROUGHT UP IF COURSES. IS DISPLACEMENT OF CURRENT COLLECTED OF CURRENT UNION MEMBERS -- YES THE DISCUSSION HAPPENS DOESN'T GET RESOLVED ABSOLUTELY NOT I MEAN THE THE NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT THIS BATTLE IS RIDICULOUS IT EVEN IF. THIS REGION AT THIS ORDER REGION'S WHO ARE FACING NOW -- AN ACA IN AND AND FACING GOING TO THE VOTERS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN -- THEIR BIZARRE UP PUBLIC POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO TO OTHERWISE LINE WORKERS -- IT EVEN WITH THAT ANYTHING THEY DO OR OR WHAT WOULD SUGGEST TO DO CAN BE UNDONE THE VERY NEXT DAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE A PERMANENT PUBLIC POLICY. THAT ENSURES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ACTS AS A RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC AGENCY AND TREATS WORKERS EQUALLY -- WHETHER THE UNION OR NONUNION WHETHER THEY WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY OR THEY'RE CONTRACTED OUT THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE TODAY -- SO DESPITE. YEARS AND PROBABLY LONGER BUT THEN I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT A DECADES OF OF DISCUSSION -- THE RESOLUTION -- IN IN NAME IS THERE CAN BE A RESOLUTION THIS TIME WOULD BE WOULD BE JUST A TEMPORARY RELIEF. I'M JUST OF CLOTHES THAT WILL THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THE INTENTIONS ARE GOOD ONES AND I CERTAINLY I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT WITH THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE AND I GUESS THE FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S YOU WANNA YOU WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT -- THE REMEDY MATCHES THE YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME FRUSTRATION. ABOUT I GUESS THIS ISSUE -- WITHIN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I GUESS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIVELY AND CONVERSATION. IT'S CERTAINLY THE BETTER PLACE TO HAVE THESE THINGS SETTLE. AND CERTAINLY THE BOARD OF REGENTS IS A BETTER PLACE -- AND AND EVEN THE LEGISLATURE LET ALONE. IN A CA ON THE BALLOT SO THAT THAT'S REALLY. THE HESITATION THAT I BRING TO THIS AND DIED I'M NOT OUT OF RESPECT YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS AND WHAT YOU WANT BUT ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO RESOLVE THIS. WITHOUT IT HAS DRAMATIC AS AN AC SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR WILK. I THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS FOR IS IS PRINCIPLE COOPER THIS BILL IS A QUESTION OF EQUITY. AND AS WELL WERE IN THE PURSUIT OF SO SOMETHING IS IT IS LIKE. THE BUZZ CUT AND ALL AND IN OUR HOUSE IS IS HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE THAT THE UC'S THROWING OUT THERE. SO I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO THINK. IF THAT IS A LEGITIMATE NUMBER THAT'S JUST A SCARE TACTIC AND HOW WOULD THAT NUMBER COMPARE. WITH IF THEY TRANSFERRED OVER IN AND DID THE RIGHT THING YES. THANK YOU SO THE UNIVERSITY SAYS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY ALREADY. SPENDING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THREE HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT. IS LABOR COSTS BASIC LABOR COST. AND THEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION. WOULD BE THE OVERHEAD COST SO. THEY SAY ALSO THAT THE ACA WILL COST AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION. LEAVING YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE TOTAL COST. IS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. LEAVING OUT THE ONE AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE. THE OVERHEAD COSTS [inaudible] GOES AWAY [inaudible] LEAVING US. WITH WHAT THE UC IS ALREADY. CURRENTLY SPENDING [inaudible] SO [inaudible] AGAIN SENATOR [inaudible] THE ACA. ACTUALLY KIND OF PAYS FOR ITSELF I'M SORRY. YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. PART OF ME CHAIRMAN K. CORNELIUS BURKE WITH A MAYOR COUNCIL WE'RE CURRENTLY WHERE. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY WOMAN I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK SOMETIMES A SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND AGO SHE CONTRACTS. FOR MANY OF THOSE YEARS -- I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T NEGOTIATED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SEE IT AS THIS PANACEA AS A GLOBAL JUST COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IT IS JUST SO EASY -- AND IT'S NEGOTIATIONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH WORKERS AND YOU'RE DEALING WITH MANAGEMENT -- IT IS WONDERFUL WHEN WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN BUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND GOSHEN ASIANS ARE NOT DIFFICULT ARE NOT EASY EITHER VERY DIFFICULT. IF WE LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU OF CW CURRENTLY THEY HAVE TAKEN A STRIKE VOTE NAY MET VERY WELL BE UP AND DOWN THE STATE GOING ON STRIKE -- SO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS SOMETHING ALL WORKERS SHOULD BE AFFORDED BUT NO ONE SHOULD SEE IT AS SOMETHING IT'S EASY. ONE OF THE REASONS I RAN FOR OFFICE IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE HERE AND HELP CHANGE LAWS THAT WOULD HELP WORKERS I SEE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO HELP WORKERS. ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE. US I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE AND I WILL I'LL JUST NOTE THAT -- YOU KNOW FOR YEARS YOU SEE HAS HAS TO CREDIT CARD YEAH YES THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THIS WOULD AFFECT THEM THE WAY THE BILLS WERE WRITTEN BEFORE BUT THEY HAVE DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE. AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS FOR YOU HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT SOMETIMES WE WOULD LIKE. AND WE RESPECT THAT WE RESPECT IT SO MUCH THAT WE WANT TO GO TO THE CONSTITUTION AND SAY IS THIS A PUBLIC POLICY. THAT VOTERS THINK IS IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW WE OFTEN HEAR OF OF YOU SEE JUST BY MYSELF ALMOST AS A FOURTH FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA I'M THEY ARE SO INDEPENDENT AND SO. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN IN TRYING PUBLIC POLICY THE WAY THAT WE WOULD WANT -- TO LEGISLATIVELY IS TO ALLOW THE THE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON A DECISION LIKE THIS AND I THINK IT'S THAT IMPORTANT WHEN YOU READ OUR CONSTITUTION YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE TRYING THEIR AT IT IT'S AMAZING YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO FISH. YOU KNOW -- PROBABLY IS PRETTY IMPORTANT I THINK I I THINK I AYE JOCKEY TO BILL FOR YOU ABOUT RAIN WATER AND AND TAX YOU KNOW -- THAT WITH THAT WAS IT IT'S NOW I'M TRYING TO NOT CONSTITUTION ALL ALL IMPORTANT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT. BUT SO IS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AT THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING IS IT IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE VOTERS ONE WAY AND ON TO SAY IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO IN TRYING IN OUR ONSTITUTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WE'RE NOT ASKING. FOR YOU -- TO TO SUPPORT THAT IDEA BECAUSE MAYBE YOU DON'T I MEAN I I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO ALLOW THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. RESPECT LAST NIGHT.
