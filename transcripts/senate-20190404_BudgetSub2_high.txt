CALL -- THE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER. TWO TO ORDER A DECISION REMINDER ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT WHAT'S BEEN MY MODEL IS THAT FOR ISSUES THAT ARE HELD OPEN I'M GOING TO HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THE END OF THE DEPARTMENTS. IN A BATCH OF ISSUES IF WE'RE GOING TO DO A VOTE ON IT I'LL DO IT. AS WE MAKE THE PRESENTATION I'M SO WITH THAT WE HAVE EIGHT MATTERS THERE ON VOTE ONLY CALENDAR THIS IS ITEMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE -- BUT CORPSMAN CALL THE ROLL SORRY [inaudible] I CASCADE [inaudible] SOUNDS. A QUIET. MORNING HERE THANK. AND HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED THIS IS ISSUES ONE THROUGH. EIGHT FOR VOTE ONLY ANY MEMBERS THAT WANT TO REMOVE SOMETHING FROM THE BUT ON THE COUNTER. THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER MONNING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I CASKEY. HI [inaudible] REQUIRE [inaudible] MONEY [inaudible] STERN. OUR MEMBERS THE SERVICE TURNED TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE WE HAVE THE LA OWES OFFICE IS HERE TO GIVE US A PRESENTATION ON COASTAL ADAPTATION. MISS TAYLOR. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THE TIME MAKE US OF THE SURGEON IS GOING TO PASS AROUND A HAND OUT FROM WHICH I WILL SPEAK. I ENTITLED COASTAL ADAPTATION IT'S ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE FOR THOSE. NOT ON THE DíAS -- SO STAFF IS ASKED ME TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF A BRIEF REPORT WE PUT OUT IN OUR BUDGET PUBLICATION IN FEBRUARY -- IT PROVIDES CONTEXT FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY BUT REALLY OUR INTENTION WAS THAT IT ALSO CREATE A FRAMING FOR A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION THAT. LIKELY WILL BE FACING YOU IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AROUND COASTAL ADAPTATION -- SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT CALIFORNIA'S COAST FACES THE THREAT OF RISING SEEDS AND TAXIS AND TIDES WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. HOW HIGH THE THE SEAS WILL RISE AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S INEVITABLE THAT WE WILL AND ALREADY ARE SEEING SOME CHANGES -- THERE SOME RANGES HERE IN THE HAND OUT FOR THE COAST BELOW MENDOCINO FROM THE RECENT STATE GUIDANCE OF SOME ESTIMATES OF WHAT THOSE PROJECTIONS ARE OVER THE COMING DECADES -- I THINK IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. HOWEVER MUCH THE ACTUAL SEE RISE THE IT RISES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COAST ARE MUCH HIGHER FROM SOME OF THE EPISODE EPISODIC EVENTS THAT HAPPENED WHEN KING TIDES AND LARGE STORM SURGES COMBINED WITH THOSE. LARGER TIED SO THAT SOMETHING ELSE TO BE PREPARED FOR OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL AFFECT PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO OUR NATURAL RESOURCES OUR BEACHES AND OUR HABITATS. BOB SO THERE ARE NO NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING ON TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES SOME OF THEM ARE HERE TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY -- THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER BUT THEY ALSO EACH HAVE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE ROLES THE COASTAL COMMISSION -- REGULATES THE USE OF LAND AND WATER IN THE COASTAL ZONE WHICH GENERALLY EXTENDS INTO ABOUT A THOUSAND YARDS INLAND FROM THE MEAN HIGH TIDE. I'M A LOT OF THAT IS THROUGH THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM REGULATORY PROCESS THE LCP WHICH I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT FROM THEM HERE TODAY -- BUT THEY ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF REGULATING IN THE SIMS IS THE BAY AREA THAT IS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION OR BC DC ALSO HERE TODAY -- THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF REGULATORY ISSUES AROUND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY -- STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY TYPICALLY DOES MORE OF A HANDS ON PROJECTS WHERE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION A. B. C. DC KIND OF WORK ON PLANNING GENERALLY ALTHOUGH THEY DO SOME PROJECTS TO COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS REALLY FOCUSED ON GIVING OUT GRANTS AND IN SOME CASES ALSO UNDERTAKING DIRECTLY SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS -- ALONG THE COAST AND IN THE BAY THEY'VE GOT BOTH JURISDICTIONS OPC THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL PLAYS A MOAT MOST IF COORDINATING ROLE ACROSS ALL OF THESE AGENCIES AT THE STATE AND ALSO FUNDS SOME STATE LEVEL ACTIVITIES LIKE RESEARCH. GUIDANCE -- AND THEN ALSO SOME LOCAL PROJECTS. AND THEN FINALLY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS OUR LANDLORD FOR THE STATE OWNED SOVEREIGN PROPERTY AND THE PROPERTY IN THAT I'M. THAILAND'S AND SUBMERGED LANDS AND SO THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY TO PROTECT STATE INTERESTS THEY'RE NOT LISTED HERE BUT ALSO WORTH NOTING IN HERE TODAY ARE THE STATE PARK SINCE THEY OWN ABOUT A THIRD OF THE COASTLINE IN OUR STATE PARKS ON ON OUR BEHALF AS AS CALIFORNIANS. THE TURNING TO PAGE TWO JUST TO TOUCH FOR A MINUTE ON FUNDING FOR COASTAL ADAPTATION THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME FUNDS OVER RECENT YEARS -- FOR BOTH PLANNING IN FOR PROJECTS -- FROM VARIOUS SOURCES GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WHICH IS THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY ALSO SOME FUNDING FROM BONDS. RECENTLY APPROVED RESOURCES BOND AND SOME GENERAL FUND I WOULD SAY THAT THE CATEGORIES THIS IS RELATIVELY MODEST IT'S KIND OF BEEN IN THE LOW MILLIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL. YEARS MAYBE. MAYBE IN THE KIND OF TEN MILLION RANGE BUT CERTAINLY NOT TENS OF MILLIONS. SO THE CHART HERE SHOW SOME OF THE RECENT G. G. R. F. APPROPRIATIONS FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE PROPOSAL THAT. IS BEFORE YOU TODAY YOU CAN SEE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION PROPOSED FOR BC DC WHICH IS AN INCREASE OVER THE RECENT YEARS -- ONE POINT FIVE FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHICH IS A CONTINUATION I WILL KNOW THAT IN RECENT YEARS THE FUNDING FOR THESE. THREE AGENCIES THAT SHOWN IN THE TABLE HAS BEEN PROVIDED ON A ONE YEAR AT A TIME BASIS SO THIS WOULD BE AT PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE IT ON GOING -- AND IT'S ALSO BEEN A LEGISLATIVE ADD EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THIS IS THIS TIME IT'S SHOWING UP AS A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO THAT'S A DISTINCTION AS WELL -- I'LL LEAVE IT TO THOSE TWO AGENCIES TO DESCRIBE THEIR PROPOSALS IN MORE DETAIL ON YOUR NEXT ITEM. SO TURNING TO PAGE THREE SOME CONSIDERATIONS WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IN THE FIRST IS REALLY MOST OF THIS WORK IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MOST OF FOR THAT PROPERTY IS OWNED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EITHER BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE ENTITIES. MOST OF THEM DECISION MAKING AND LAND USE DECISIONS HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO THERE FOR MOST OF THE PRIMARY. LIABILITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IS ALSO GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE STATE JUST WASHES ITS HANDS AND WALKS AWAY THERE'S A VERY LARGE STATE INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT THERE'S PREPARATION -- AN ADAPTATION HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BOTH FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS. AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE AS THE STATE ALSO OWN PROPERTY ALONG THE COAST INCLUDING HIGHWAYS AND BEACHES THAT WILL NEED PROTECTION AND WE ARE THE PUBLIC. TRUST ENTITY AS THE STATE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES. SO WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL CERTAINLY REASONABLE AND AND MEET SOME IMPORTANT NEEDS -- BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN MESSAGES WE WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY IS THAT THIS. LIKELY JUST A STARTING PLACE -- OVER THE COMING YEARS AND THAT -- THERE'S STILL. A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE FOR PREPARATION AND THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA NEED STATE ASSISTANCE BOTH PROBABLY FINANCIAL BUT ALSO -- POLICY GUIDANCE AND ADDITIONAL TOOLS. SO ON THAT NOTE TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT AND THIS IS ALSO A PAGE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA -- SOME OF THE KEY LEGISLATIVE QUESTIONS WE WOULD RECOMMEND YOU START GRAPPLING WITH. I'M NOT JUST TODAY OF COURSE BUT IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AND THE FIRST ONE WE THINK IS REALLY KEY WHICH IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE WAY THAT THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD BE MOST HELPFUL AND WHAT IS. THE LOCAL ROLL KIND OF FIGURING OUT THOSE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE IS ENGAGING IN LEVERAGING -- ITS RESOURCES AND ASSISTANCE IN THE MOST HELPFUL WAY POSSIBLE -- SECOND WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS IT SUFFICIENT -- IT ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THE STATE CAN DO EITHER THROUGH CARROTS OR THROUGH STICKS TO HELP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. FUNDING WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL HOW CAN WE TARGET IT MOST EFFECTIVELY -- AND ARE THERE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE OR BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH -- TOOLS THAT AREN'T BEING UTILIZED YET THAT THAT MAYBE REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE ACTION. TO ENABLE. ONE OF THE ROLES WAYS THE STATE HAS BEEN MOST HELPFUL I THINK SO FAR AND CAN CONTINUE TO BE HELPFUL IS PROVIDING DATA AND DOING RESEARCH ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. THROUGH KIND OF MEANS OF SCALE TO PROVIDE TO LOCAL LEVEL SO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN THAT ROLE AND ALSO CONTINUING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REFLECTING UPDATED SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDINGS AS THINGS CHANGE AND PROVIDING THAT GUIDANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL -- FOR STATE ASSETS SOME OF THESE PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS ARE THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY AND ARE WE ENGAGING AND TAKING ACTION THAT WE NEED TO PUT TO DO TO PROTECT OUR ASSETS INCLUDING HIGHWAYS BUILDINGS AND BEACHES AND HOW IS THAT BEING COR NEEDED. WHAT ARE THE COST ESTIMATES AND HAVE THE FUNDING BEEN PROVIDED FOR FOR THOSE STATE RESPONSIBILITIES? AND THEN FINALLY ON THE L. C. P. OUR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION THAT IS HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN ENGAGED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN A LOT OF THESE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT AN ADAPTATION DECISIONS AND ACTIONS SO CONTINUING TO MONITOR HOW THAT PROCESS IS WORKING -- IS EFFECTIVE IS IT THE BEST CONTINUE TO BE THE BEST WAY AND HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE -- IT IN TERMS OF THAT STATE AND LOCAL NEXUS. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO CLOSE BY SAYING THIS IS ACTUALLY AN AREA THAT OUR OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO BE INCREASINGLY ENGAGING IN THIS THINKING ABOUT A LOT AND IS PLANNING TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK ON SO WE WANT TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU IS YOU'RE ENGAGING ON THESE. ISSUES SO IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU THINK WE CAN BE HELPFUL AND THINGS YOU'D LIKE US TO SPEND SOME TIME ON THIS IS AN AREA WE THINK IS GOING TO BE A BIG PRIORITY FOR YOU ALL AND FOR THE STATE. I IN THE COMING YEAR SO PLEASE THINK OF US AS A RESOURCE -- LAST YEAR I GAVE A LECTURE TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CROWD ABOUT COMING IN FOR A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR AND NOT. HAVING A CLEAN NEXUS BETWEEN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES -- WITH AB. AKTION MONIES FROM THIS YEAR I GET IT TWENTY TWENTY ONE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. ADAPTATION HAS SOME OF THE SAME CHALLENGES WITH WITH MONEY THIS THIS YEAR. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND THEN -- HOW MIGHT THAT BE PACKAGED UP BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A REQUEST HERE? OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS ALLEGEDLY JUST TAKE TRAIN THE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE WOULD WANT HIM TO DO. SO WE GOT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION IN TRAINING AND THREE MILLION A LEASE. ON GOING SO. HELP ME OUT ON THAT. THE FIRST PART ON THERE. ON THE YEAH I I THINK I'LL DEFER TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE JUSTIFICATION I WILL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS USED TO TERRA FOR IN RECENT YEARS THESE ADAPTATION ACTIVITY SO IT'S NOT A NEW USE OF THESE FUNDS FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. I THINK HE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN VERY -- FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE DRAW THOSE LINES JUST TRYING TO SET AN EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE AT LEAST. IN THE COMING YEARS [inaudible] M.. TALK ABOUT THE OVERLAP -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE YOU DO YOU DO YOU FOCUSED ON THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN A LOCAL RESPONSIBLE IN TRYING TO SORT THAT OUT IN WHETHER WE MAKE GRANTS AVAILABLE OR WE HAVE. THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE DOING NOW IF ON THE RESEARCH AND DATA DATA -- I THINK SOME OF THE LINES ARE FUZZY AND I THINK SOME OF THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT COMES BECAUSE WE HAVE STORM SURGES THAT MAY HAVE A FLOODING. IMPACT THAT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE LITTLE ADAPTATION OR CLIMATE SEA LEVEL RISE BOX BUT STILL. PART OF THE PHENOMENA. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS TO TO MAKE THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MOST SUCCESSFUL IS TO ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE THOSE TYPES OF FLOODING FROM SOURCE STORM SURGES ARE NOT -- CAN'T BE THOUGHT OF AS SURPRISE UNPREDICTABLE ANYMORE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEM WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMING THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD RESEARCH HAPPENING OUT OF SCRIPTS -- BE IT YEAH YOU SEE SAN DIEGO IN THE IMPERIAL BEACH AREA OF SAN DIEGO THEY'VE GOT. IN THERE USING BOOTIES AND DROWNS TO TRY AND PREDICT -- SOME OF THE WIND THIS STORM SURGE WILL COME AND WEAR IT LIKE A FEW DAYS OUT SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREPARED AND KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT'S COMING. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT -- COULD COULD BE A PILOT PROJECT THAT PERHAPS COULD BE EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS NOT VERY COSTLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THE MOVIES OUT THERE SO IT'S JUST AT AND PLAYING SOME ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION TO LOOK AT AT WHEN THERE'S A STORM PREDICTED WE KNOW WHERE THE SEAS ARE WE KNOW WHAT THE TIDES ARE WHERE IS THAT WATER. IN A CALM SO THAT COMMUNITIES CAN GET SAND BAGS IN PLACE OR IF THEY'RE DOING LONGER TERM PROJECTS PRIORITIZE THIS IS WHERE THE FLOODING IS GONNA CONTINUALLY HAPPEN MAYBE EPISODICALLY. BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THERE SO THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR PRIORITIES FIRST NOW AS FAR AS TIMING IS CONCERNED IT'S AS IF WE HAVE THESE PILOTS OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. THAT THAT ARE READY TO BUY THE CALL SHOVEL READY TO READY TO GO OUT. PRESUMABLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE LEARNED FRM THOSE SOME WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT IN THEORY IT WORKS IF IT WORKS OR NOT THAT WOULD BE TRANSFERABLE TO DIFFERENT. OUR WATER WAYS OR RIVERS THAT METER THE OCEAN OR JUST -- WETLANDS THAT CAN BE HAD CAN BE INUNDATED RIGHT AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S PROBABLY A PERFECT NEXUS TO YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE STATE ROLE LOCAL ROLE EEN IF IT'S A PROJECT THAT. REALLY BENEFITS THE LOCALS THE STATE COULD PUT THE FUNDING AND FOR SOME OF THESE PILOT PROJECTS THAT COULD THEN. SHOW A STATEWIDE BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY COULD BE -- LEARN FROM AND THEN UTILIZED EMPLOYED IN OTHER AREAS FOR SOME I'M INTERESTED IN THE IN THE BUDGET REQUEST FROM BC DC THERE'S NO REQUEST FOR GRANT FUNDS TO SORT OF HELP WITH THESE. PILOT OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY THEY'RE HELPING WITH THE ASSISTING THE LOCALS THAT COMPETENT PLANS AND AND DO IT WHERE THE DAYS -- COASTAL COMMISSION HAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN IN GRANTS THAT THERE COULD BE GIVING OUT IS THERE SOME REASON THE THE THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN THE OCEAN -- WETLAND -- AREAS IT'S NOT HAPPEN IN THE BAY I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD I WILL ACTUALLY CHARACTERIZE THE COASTAL COMMISSION MANY AS PLANNING MANY AS WELL BOTH OF THESE POTS I THINK ARE REALLY PLANNING MONEY BECAUSE EVEN THE GRANTS THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION WOULD GIVE THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS FOR PLANNING VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS CHANGES TO THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FOR PROJECTS IT'S TO PLAN FOR THE PROJECTS AND I THINK THAT'S THE CASE. FOR BE CDC AS WELL -- AS A MAN AS I NOTED MOST OF THE MONEY TYPICALLY THAT IS GIVEN FOR PROJECTS COMES OUT OF THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY -- AND PC SOME TO BAY AREA AND AGAIN THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION IS THAT IS THAT THAT. THAT DANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AGENCY SAYING WE HAVE A PROJECT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE LEVEL [inaudible] RIGHT. OR RISING IN OUR IMPACTS IMPACT RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BC DC THAT'S HELPING THEM WITH THE OR HAS SOME INFORMATION WITH THEM THE STATE. ALSO COMMISSION WOULD BE THE VEHICLE THAT WE WOULD USE IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN. GRANT FUNDING GRANTS IS THAT HI. AND TYPICALLY IT'S THE CONSERVANCY THE SERVICE THURMOND GRANT YES THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT THESE TWO AGENCIES TYPICALLY ARE MORE ENGAGED IN. PLANNING THEY DO. AND AND HAVE HISTORY OF GIVING GRANTS FOR PROJECTS AS WELL AND THEY ALL DO WORK TOGETHER BUT I'M KIND OF IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BROAD STROKES I WOULD SAY THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE BROAD STROKES OF ALL THOSE HYDROLOGISTS HANG OUT TOGETHER. CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- JUST CAN BE QUICK AND THEN BE INTERESTED FROM EXACTLY FOSTER OFFICER THE COST QUESTION. HE IS PRESENTING TODAY. LOOK. AT THE COAST MACHINE HAS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM THAT WERE THERE THEY'RE OFFERING GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDE. FOR PLANNING AND TO DROP IN THE BUCKET. ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO GO SEVEN MILLION MR EXACT OF OFFICER AT APPROXIMATELY. AT THE END. WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEED IN THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE JUST PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ON OUR COASTLINES -- WHAT IS THAT LONG TERM PLAN -- AND TO BE ABLE. TO SAY IF WE'RE GONNA SAY TO LOCALS THAT THEY HAVE TO BECOME MORE RESILIENT. IT'S GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR LOCALS BE ABLE GENERATE THE REVENUE TO BE ABLE. TO FORTIFY THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE OR TO BE ABLE TO CANDIDLY MOVE BACK IS WELL. SO. BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK. A GRAND VISION OF WHAT THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE BOTH. WHAT OUR GOALS ARE AND HOW WE'RE GONNA FUND NAME? IN ALSO REALIZE IN AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT THROWING STONES THE CALLS WHICH IS A OF THE ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING IT -- IN TRYING TO FIND BUT IT IS SO MINOR IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THE ISSUE THAT'S CAN IMPACT IS OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ALL THIS USE MARIN COUNTY IS EXAMPLE WE HAVE AREAS IN -- NO VALLEY THAT ENDED IN TIMBER ON THE CURRENTLY FLIGHT NOW. WE HAVE AREAS ARE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO -- THE PARK AND RIDE LOT -- ALONG WITH A ONE ALL INUNDATED DURING KING TIDES HIGHWAY ONE A ONE IT MARIN CTY. INUNDATED DURING KING TIDES WERE SHUT DOWN THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARE THAT CONNECTS TOWARD THE SOUTH A SALE THAT IS -- HOPEFULLY IN MAY IN THIS WOULD BE THROUGH CHAIR MAYBE IN THE IN THE FALL OF DOING SOME TYPE OF SPECIAL HEARING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. IS GOING. TO BE ON OUR PLATE FOR MANY MANY DECADES TO COME BEFORE THE RAINS HEY THERE YOU GO THAT'S EXACTLY. I'M NO I MEAN I THINK YOUR TO MAKE A POINT IT'S IT'S BEEN RATHER -- CHALLENGING TO GET THE RESEARCH MONEY AND TO GET THE LITTLE PITTANCE OF MONEY THAT HAVE GONE TO THESE AGENCIES HAVE BEFORE US. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SO -- WE SHE THE UNDER SCORING AND IN THE ALLEY OWES -- OFFER TO BE A PARTNER FOR US CENTER STERN. THANK YOU LET ME. DOUBLE UNDERSCORE THEN I MEAN I JUST TO SET THE CONTEXT. FOR IN THE QUANTITY OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE U. S. G. S. REPORT THAT. AND THEN JUST CAME OUT. THE TIME IS 6%OF CALIFORNIA'S ENTIRE GDP ON THE LINE. IN ON THE TRAJECTORY WERE ON IN OVER THIS THIS CENTURY IT'S TWO SCALES ROUTE REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND AND SO I MEAN GETTING PLANNING DOLLARS COMING YES. BUT CAPITALIST PLAN I MEAN I I I KEEP WHEN WE BROUGHT THE SEVEN IF YOU HEARINGS WITH LA -- SORT OF QUANTIFY THE SCOPE OF THE TOTAL RISK. COMPREHENSIVELY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A FISCALLY ORIENTED WAY LOOKING AT THAT FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT TO REALLY. GO BEYOND SCIENCE INSERTED IMPACTS WRIT LARGE DOWN TO LIKE DOLLARS. WE START TO RIGHT SIZE THE THE SCOPE OF NEED THAT RIGHT AND SO WHAT I WONDER IF YOU ALL AS YOU CONTINUE FALL THIS ALSO IS. IS THERE SOME METRIC WE CAN BE USING. TO TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH RISK WE WERE BUYING DOWN WHEN WE AND MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. THAT IT'S IT'S A IT MIGHT SET MORE CONTEXT IN THIS FEELING LIKE -- THIS ISN'T AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME YOU'RE JUST SPENDING ON LIKE FEEL GOOD PROJECTS ON THE COAST LINE AND YEA THE BEACH. LIKE NO ACTUALLY WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE YEAH AND AND SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH. THE MATH I I WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S SOMEWHAT SOME SENSITIVITY IN IT BUT WE DO THIS IN ACTUAR REALLY ANALYSES ARE. IN THIS WHAT REINSURANCE COMPANIES DO CONSTANTLY RIGHT SO IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS WANT TO CONSIDER YES AND WE ARE AND WHAT YOU VESTED GOOD QUESTIONS THAT WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T HAD SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO IN SEVERAL HEARINGS AND SO WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH ITS IT IS AND AND AND TAKING. IT SERIOUSLY AND HOPING TO SPEND SOMETIME OVR THE SUMMER AND FALL I MEAN I THINK I WILL ONE CONTEXT I WILL ADD IS. IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE. ACTUALLY BUYING DOWN RISK THERE IS A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE GONE THROUGH FIRST OF WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES IN DOING THE AVAILABILITY ASSESSMENT AND THEN THE PLANNING FOR HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT AND THEN UNDERTAKEN THE PROJECT SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S GOOD THAT WE HAVEN'T SPENT BILLIONS. IN PROJECTS YET WHEN WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE PHONE ABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND PLANNING I THINK. ONE OF OUR MESSAGES AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR THIS FROM FROM THE AGENCIES AS WELL AS WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF THAT PLANNING DONE THAT'S GREAT WE NEED TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY IN THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND PLANNING. WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING THEM DO THAT AND AND TO TO SHOUT OUT THE CHAIRS LEGISLATION HERE I MEAN THE THE EFFICACY OF ADDING MORE FIRE POWER IN? TWO NOT JUST THE CONSERVANCY BUT ALSO IT -- PR IN THOSE DOING THE FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT AND FIND A WAY TO GET SOME OF THIS STUFF COORDINATED IN A WAY THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CAPACITY FOR THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY THEY CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT SO LIKE HOW TO BUILD THAT INDEED THE SEQUEL -- GENERAL PLAN UPDATES AGAIN A REALLY. EASY TURN KEY WAY YOU GOT OFF THE SHELF GOOD SOLID PEER REVIEWED STUDIES COMING OUT. SO ANY OUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LINING WITH WHERE YOUR GUYS HAS A YEAH AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'D REALLY LIKE TO LOOK AT MORE CLOSELY AS IF THERE ARE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE KIND OF FOR THEIR HAD WHAT IS ENABLING THEM TO GET FURTHER AHEAD. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND THEN IF THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE STRONGLY MORE WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THAT KIND OF STATEWIDE LEVEL? I GUESS THE QUESTION COMES ON THESE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT IS A I THINK YOU COULD MAKE A CASE. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA SAN FRANCISCO I WAS BORN THERE SO I CAN SAY THAT THEY THEY HAVE. A BIG VOICE ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE. TO AS ADDRESS SEALEVEL RISE AND THAT'S TO BUILD BARRIERS AROUND THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT THAT DOES NOT HELP OUT MARIN. ALAMEDA COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY SAN MATEO COUNTY SO THERE THEY WERE WELL DEVELOPED BUT THAT'S I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S A LOCAL ISSUE THAT IS. HORRIBLE SELF INTEREST HORRIBLE. STEPPED VERSUS THE WORK ON ALAMEDA CREEK TO CREATE -- RE HAVE RE HYDRATES OR RECONSTITUTE TO REVERSES THAT THAT YOU INCREASE THE WETLAND -- THROUGHOUT THE BAY IT'S COST THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YOU REDUCE SEA LEVEL RISING IN. MARIN. INFRA HEY WORD IN A SAN MATTEO BY A FOOT. BRUCE IS JUST HELPING OUT DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO AND AND I CAN GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE FROM SAN FRANCISCO YELLING AT US ABOUT WE NEED THIS TO PROTECT OUR FINANCIAL INTEREST. VERSUS SOMEBODY FROM SAN LEANDRO COMING IN HERE AND SAYING BUT THE HYDROLOGY WILL WORK OUT SO THAT WE ALL BENEFITS SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE NEED THE HELP FROM THE ALEJO. AND ALSO FOR MáS IS TO IS TO LOOK AT THESE. THESE ARE. POTENTIALLY POOR QUIET. YES THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT THAT WOULD BENEFIT EVERYBODY IN THAT GOES REGION REGION WHETHER YOU'RE IN SAN DIEGO OR YOU'RE IN THE CENTRAL COAST YOU SAY WE GOT A LOT OF BIG MOUTHS OF HAVE AN IDEA. BUT IT'S NOT THE BEST IDEA TO GETS THE BEST POP BEST BEING BEST GOOD FOR THE REGION. IN THIS ADAPTATION. I THINK YOU'LL HEAR QUITE A BIT FROM THE CDC ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY ARE I'M REALLY TRYING TO HELP LEAD IN THE IN THE BAY. SPECIFICALLY OF REGIONAL APPROACH SO I'LL DEFER TO THEM BUT I I THERE THERE IS PROGRESS BEING MADE ON THAT POINT AND THAT APPROACH IN THE BAY I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM. OKAY THIS IS A ISSUE NUMBER NINE THERE'S NO ACTION WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. THEY OPEN UP. YEAH ALL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARINGS IS THE GENERAL COMMENTS ON COASTAL ADAPTATION. WE WILL GO. DRILL DOWN ON THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE SO I MIGHT. OKAY TO TAKE MORE TIME. NO JUST OKAY I'LL BE BRIEF. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS -- ONE OF THEM AND AND REALLY WANT TO THINK THE LA -- FOR FRAMING THIS AS NOT JUST WERE TALKING ABOUT THE A FEW MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET BUT REALLY THE HIGHLIGHT BEATEN THE DRASTIC NEED MOVING FORWARD -- WHAT ONE THING I WOULD ALSO MENTION IS THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THE ROLE THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION PLACE IN ALL THIS -- I THINK AS LAND OWNERS OF ONE THIRD THE COASTLINE INC IN CALIFORNIA THEY WILL BE A PART OF THE SO IT AS DISCUSSIONS AROUND FUNDING IN A ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR THESE ISSUES -- THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY BE THE TABLE -- ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- THERE WAS MENTION OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF SOMEONE STONE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING WITH AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA ON OZELL TO LOOK AT EXISTING REVENUES FROM THE TIDE LINES. ACCOUNT -- WHICH HAS A DIRECT NEXUS AS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE TO TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN COST LETTER TATIAN GIVEN THAT WE ARE PUMPING ALL THIS OIL FROM OUR OFFSHORE. OIL WELLS IN STATE WATERS -- AND WE GET SOME REVENUE BUT THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THAT REVENUE AND DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS -- AT LEAST NOT IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO. ALSO BEING ABLE TO GO BACK TO AND TO RE LINK AND CREATE THAT NEXUS I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE AND VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN OR TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING MOVING FORWARD. THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IS IS AROUND -- NEEDING TO REALLY EMPHASIZE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS -- MOVING FORWARD -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EVEN COASTAL ACCESS IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE. AND THEN THE PUZZLE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RELYING HEAVILY ON RIPRAP IN ANOTHER -- HARD AGREE INFRASTRUCTURES A SEQUELS DOES HAVE -- DIRECT IMPACTS TO ADJACENT BEACHES DOWN THE LINE -- WHICH FURTHER REDUCES THAN THE AMOUNT OF BEACH SANDY BEACHES THAT WE'D HAVE ACCESSIBLE TO US AS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- SO ON BEHALF OF US WOULD WANT TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AGAIN AND THANKS OFFER THE DISCUSSION AND LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE ENGAGE. PART WILL CLOSE AT MATTER AND LET'S CALL UP. ISSUE NUMBER. TEN THIS IS GOING TO BE A JOINT CALIFORNIA COLTS THE COMMISSION AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. CONTINUATION ON OUR COASTAL ADAPTATION -- THE MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME'S JACK GAINES WORTH -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. AND I SO MUCH APPRECIATE THE LA OWES -- PRESENTATION ON COASTAL -- ADAPTATION AND THIS COMMITTEES INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S COAST LINE. IS FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR COAST IN OCEAN ECONOMY IS AT RISK FROM CLIMATE DRIVEN STILL ARISE WHICH INVOLVES FLOODING INUNDATION EROSION. AND ULTIMATELY THE LOSS OF OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PROPERTIES ALONG THE COAST. ONE RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT -- WE DON'T TAKE ACTION NOW TWO THIRDS OF OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES ARE GOING TO BE -- GONE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ECONOMIC HEART AND SOUL OF A LOT OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. AND WITH EACH NEW STUDY THE GETS PUBLISHED WE LEARNED THAT THE SEAS ARE RISING FASTER. AND THAT THERE WILL BE HOT THE IT WE RISING HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. RECENT USGS STUDY AS YOU JUST MENTIONED FOUND THAT. WITH THAT JUST WITH A MODEST INCREASE IN SEAL RISE IN COMBINATION WITH THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVEN AMPED UP STORMS COULD RESULT IN A REALLY DEVASTATING -- FIXED WERE -- COASTAL COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S HAPPENING NOW IT'S NOT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE FUTURE WE'RE SEEING WITH KING TIDES WITH JUST EIGHTEEN INCHES OF RISE AND AND AND SEAL WITH THOSE REFLECTING THOSE KING TIDE YOU SEE FLOODING UP AND DOWN THE COAST LINE WE'VE DOCUMENTED THAT REALLY WELL THROUGH OUR KING TIDES. PROJECT -- TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF BEEN ON THE COAST. IT REALLY OF INCREDIBLE IMAGERY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT THE COASTAL COMMISSION -- TO GET OUT AHEAD OF IT. THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION --% PER YEAR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS TO OUR BASELINE BUDGET AND THESE FUNDS WILL CONTINUE SUPPORT PLANNING GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SUPPORT THE COMMISSION STAFF'S EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THIS PLANNING. EFFORT. SO OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE AWARDED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS THAT THIRTY SEVEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- TO UPDATE THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS OR L. CP'S FOCUSING ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEAL RISE ADAPTATION. PLANNING AND THIS PLAN INCLUDES -- REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH SMART GROWTH CONCEPTS BY REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND DEVELOPING POLICIES TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES ALSO FROM WILDFIRES -- BECAUSE THERE ARE CALLS TO COMMUNITIES -- THEIR THREAT BY LIGHT WILD FIRES THAT WE SEE IN LAST YEAR. AND THESE GRANTS OF FUNDED THIRTY THREE A DRAFTER FINAL SEAL RISING CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS TWELVE DRAFTER FINAL ANATASE REPORTS THIRTY FIVE DRAFTER FINAL LCP DOCUMENTS. AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HAVE -- FINAL L. C. P. CERTIFICATIONS FOR THE COASTAL SIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO -- THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. SELANNE BEACH AND THE THE CITY -- COUNTY SAN DIEGO. AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WORK IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY INCLUDING OUR MOST RECENT GRANT ROUND WARDS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- FROM THE G. HERE OF APPROPRIATIONS FROM LAST YEAR. NOW. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PLANNING FOR THESE ISSUES CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT IN CONTROVERSY ALL THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE ARE HELPING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NAVIGATE THE LCP UPDATE PROCESS BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND POLICY GUIDANCE. TO HELP DEMYSTIFY THE COMPETING SCIENTIFIC MODELS THE COMMISSION IS STOPPED ADOPTED -- ITS ITS FIRST YOU SEE OVER AS GUIDANCE DOCUMENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE RECENTLY UPDATED. THE TO INCLUDE CURRENT US SEAL RICE PROJECTIONS IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FROM THE OPC. THE SCIENCE. STAFF IS ALSO DEVELOPING ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS FOCUSED ON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THESE DOCUMENTS PROVIDE PRACTICAL SAMPLE POLICY LANGUAGE AND ADAPTATION. PLANNING TOOLS TO HELP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD BEGIN THIS PROCESS OF PLANNING AND TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IN ADDITION WE'RE ASKING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TO CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PLAN UPDATES. AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT -- IN THROUGHOUT ALL WE ARE CONTINUALLY TO COLLABORATING WITH OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS THE CDC. THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL STATE PARKS CALTRANS OPR AND STATE LANDS COMMISSION -- ADAPTATION IS GONNA BE COSTLY THIS COULD BE PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE ANALYST'S EMERGENCIES PROPER RESPONSES BY A MARGIN OF FOUR TO ONE GRANT REQUEST CONTINUE TO OUTSTRIP -- ARE AVAILABLE FUNDS WE RECEIVED OVER TWELVE MILLION% DOLLARS IN GRANT REQUESTS AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE THE AWARDS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE PROGRESS -- THAT WERE MAKING -- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THESE THESE THESE PROGRAMS INCREASE THESE PROGRAM FUNDING. TO CREATE A SAFE AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA COASTAL COASTLINE FOR OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO COME. SO I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- AN ALTERNATE OVER -- TO WE HAVE MISTER. OR DEPUTY DOUBLE BACK PRESENT AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK AND FORTH THANK YOU. MANY MEMBERS I AM TO GO BACK WITH BCC I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS ON A LONG PLANNED TRIP. IN SENDS HIS REGRETS -- BUT BC DC IS. AS THEY'LL THEY'LL TALK ABOUT A OF REGIONAL AGENCY THAT REGULATES AND PLANS FOR SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND THEN I'M HERE IT COUNTIES -- SHORELINE AS ONE INTEGRATED UNIT AND WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON RISING SEA LEVEL IN THE IMPACTS ON THE SHORELINE I HAVE A BRIEFING PAPER THAT WAS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE. IN FRONT OF YOU AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF PAGES SHOW -- THROUGH PICTURES WELL OF YOU'VE JUST HEARD THAT RISING FEEL IMPACTS ALREADY HERE IN FACT THIS PICTURE IS C&lt;c.cyan&gt; JUNCTION IN.&lt;/c&gt; MARIN SHOWING US ANY DAY FLOODING. FROM HIGH TIDES SO THIS ISN'T A THEORY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING -- AND I WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT ON THIS PAGE HERE YOU SEE A MAP THAT SHOWS -- THE VULNERABLE AREAS ALONG THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY SHORELINE AS A PART OF OUR PLANNING PROJECT WE'VE TRIED TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS. THAT ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE WHICH INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES -- IN -- COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND THESE FOLKS ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE. HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO RESPOND TO FLOODING AND OTHER EMERGENCIES AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A HEAVY FOCUS IS A ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED. ON ADDRESSING THESE COMMUNITIES. THE NEXT PAGE SHOWS THE SOUTH BAY AND THIS GOES TO TALK TO THE COST. THERE IS AROUND YES -- I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY OF THE HIGH TECH COMMUNITIES BUT MOST ALL THE MEN THERE SHOWN ON THE MAP HERE ARE ALONG THE BAY SHORE LINE INCLUDING FACEBOOK. AND THE GOOGLE PLAQUES WELL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU GOOGLE SOMETHING THEY SAID SORRY WE'RE FLOODING RIGHT NOW WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT -- ONE THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE DID A STUDY A FEW YEARS BACK THAT ESTIMATED THE COST JUST TO REPLACE -- THE BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUCH THAT WOULD BE -- FLOODED AT A FIVE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE IS OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T COST. OUT THE LOST WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY SO THERE ARE VERY LARGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDRESSING RISING SEA LEVEL. AND NEXT PAGE SHOWS -- WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT WE ARE A PLANNING IN A REGULATORY AGENCY THIS IS A PICTURE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO SHORELINE? ON THE LEFT HERE IS THE AG BUILDING -- RIGHT BY THE FERRY BUILDING WHICH WAS BUILT MANY YEARS AGO. AND YOU CAN SEE THE HIGH TIDE LINE IS VERY GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE THE PIER -- BOTTOM ON THE RIGHT IS A NEW FERRY TERMINAL THAT IS JUST BEEN CONSTRUCTED. AND THE PERMITS THAT WE GRANTED THEM REQUIRED THEM TO BE RESILIENT TO MID CENTURY. AND TO HAVE AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO END OF CENTURY WHICH IS WHAT WE REQUIRE OF ALL OUR MAJOR PROJECTS AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY ARE SO MUCH HIGHER. THAT'S SO YOU CAN SEE THE STARK DIFFERENCE THAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TRYING TO ADAPT. IN SAM CISCO BAY AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS THE EMERGENCY WATER TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FLOODING WHEN YOU NEED -- WHEN YOU HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE IN YOU NEED TO GET PEOPLE -- MOVED AROUND SAN FRANCISCO BAY. AB BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU CAN'T GET TO A RESILIENT REGION JUST THROUGH THE PERMIT PROCESS SO WE ARE DOING A REGIONAL PLANNING -- THE NEXT PAGE US IS -- ATHENA STUDY AND I'LL -- UP. MY PARTNER HERE AND THIS STUDY SHOW THAT THE BENEFITS FROM DOING ADVANCE MITIGATION PLANNING ARE -- WE'RE SHOWN TO BE MORE THAN FOUR ONE SIX TWO ONE BENEFITS FROM DOING ADVANCE MITIGATION PLANNING. AND SO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE IN ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES PROGRAM -- OR ART AS WE CALL IT THAT IS DOING REGIONAL PLANNING ON WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- TO DO VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND ADAPTATION PLANNING AND OUR CURRENT STUDY IS ART BAY AREA WHERE WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS THE BAIT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK INCLUDING A LOT OF STATE HIGHWAY ASSETS AND LOOKING AT THEIR VULNERABILITY. AND LOOKING AT ADAPTATION MEASURES FOR THEM AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED -- PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND CONSERVATION AREAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE DOING THIS WITH THE GRANT FROM CALTRANS AND THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- ONE WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WITH EASTERN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY -- TO DO A VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND ADAPTATION PLANNING -- WITH THEM AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THEY ARE OUTSIDE OUR PERMIT JURISDICTION -- BUT THEY LIKE SO MUCH THE WORK WE DID WESTERN -- RICHMOND THAT. THEY ASKED US TO COME AND WORK WITH THEM AND WE HAVE A GRANT FROM -- THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO DO THAT WORK. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE ALSO GENERATED THAT'S SOMETHING I RECOMMEND YOU ALL GO LOOK AT THE ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES BAY SHORELINE FOOT EXPLORER. IT'S AN ONLINE TOOL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT VARIOUS AREAS ALONG THE BAY SHORE LINE AND LOOK AT VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF RISING SEA LEVEL IN EXTREME STORMS TO SEE WHAT GETS INUNDATED WHEN AND WHERE THAT FLOODING COMES FROM. BASED UPON THE MAPPING AND THE OTHER VULNERABILITY WORK THAT THAT WE HAVE DONE TO DATE -- AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WELL WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD GET -- WE ARE -- IN IN OUR PROPOSAL IS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS. AND WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD BE TO ALLOW US TO FULLY PLAN. AS HE'S ME FULLY FUND OUR PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHICH RIGHT NOW IS DONE MOST ALL OF THIS WORK ON GRANTS AND ONE TIME GREENHOUSE GAS. PRODUCTION FUND -- ALLOCATIONS -- IN THIS WILL ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHICH IS RESILIENCE PLANNING FOR THE ENTIRE REGION. THAT LOOKS AT IT AT LOOKS AT IT AS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AS ONE CONNECTED NETWORK AND THE IMPACTS OF WHAT A LOCAL COMMUNITY DO EVEN IF WE WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE THEMSELVES RESILIENT NOT ONLY CAN. IMPACT THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IT CAN -- IMPACT PEOPLE ACROSS. THE BAY FROM THE SOUTH BAY TO THE NORTH BAY SO WE NEED TO THE PLAN -- TO BECOME RESILIENT AS A REGION THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW US TO START -- PREPARATION OF A REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION FRAMEWORK TO START WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DO THIS -- INTEGRATE THE LOOK AT REGIONAL PLANNING -- WE WILL SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO PLANNERS -- THAT WILL BE ADDED ONE WILL BE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONSTANTLY TO TRY TO DO THIS COORDINATION WORK THE OTHER ONE WILL FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY WE A AREN'T -- NEGLECTING THE REGULATORY SIDE WE WILL HAVE TWO NEW ANALYSTS ONE WILL BE -- WORKING ON SHORELINE DESIGN WITH PREVENT IT -- APPLICANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE DESIGNS ARE RESILIENT AND THE OTHER ONE WILL BE WORKING WITH -- OTHER -- REGULATORY AGENCIES THE BAY TO DO COOPERATIVE PLANNING FOR THESE -- WELL IN RESTORATION PROJECT IN NONSTRUCTURAL A MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THEM VERTICALLY TO USE THE FUNDS THAT THE REGION -- HAS GOTTEN FROM MEASURE A A WHICH IS A PARTIAL TAX ON EVERY -- PARCEL -- INCLUDING MINE IN THE BAY AREA. IS FUNDING RESTORATION PROJECTS COULD THAT CAN ALSO HELP THE SHORELINE BECOME MORE RESILIENT. SO -- THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO -- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- UP TO GO BACK AYE. INTIMATED THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ARE SPECIFIC GRANTS AVAILABLE TO YOU TO HELP OUT THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE THESE OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE MAYBE NOT FULLY. COOKED ON THEIR PILOT PROGRAM BUT THERE ALONG THE WAY THAT SINCE YOU'RE HELPING THEM IN THE ART PROGRAM MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE -- TO TO EFFECTUATE THAT ADAPTATION PLANNING AM I OFF BASE IS WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL. A TEAR ACOSTA YOU'RE EXACTLY CORRECT THE CDC DOESN'T HAVE GRANTING AUTHORITY -- SO THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING -- AND DO NOT PLAN WITH THESE FUNDS TO DO UP -- PLANNING GRANTS BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS USING THESE FUNDS TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE NOT JUST GOING OUT AND DOING AND I STUDY AND PUTTING IT UP ON THE SHELF -- WE'RE GOING OUT THERE AND WORKING WITH THEM AND PART OF WHAT WE SEE. US AND OUR OUR PARTNER AGENCIES WERE KIND OF AT THE SWEET SPOT IN THIS BECAUSE THE LOCAL FOLKS ARE ON THE GROUND THEY NEED TO BE DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THEY CAN'T. HIRE SOMEBODY TO BECOME AN EXPERT ON REGIONAL PLANNING AN ADAPTATION PLANNING -- BUT WE'RE AT THE LEVEL WHERE WE CAN BE WORKING WITH THEM DIRECTLY BUT WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL -- AND THE NATIONAL FOLKS TO BRING THAT EXPERTISE DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL SO -- SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE APPROACH THAT WE SEE OURSELVES TAKING AND SPECIFIC TO YOUR POINT. THERE WAS THE RESILIENT BY DESIGN COMPETITION IN THE AREA THAT LOOKED AT VARIOUS PROJECTS TO BECOME A RESILIENT AND TO RISING SEA LEVEL. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO WORK WITH THEM AND WITH THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS AND TAKE SOME OF THOSE SITES. AND WERE THEY IDENTIFY PARTICULAR PROJECTS ON THE GROUND IN WORKING WITH FOLKS TO TRY TO REALLY DO THOSE PROJECTS. AS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY ADAPT -- THAT COULD BE THEN BE -- USED OTHER PLACES AS WELL SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW MIGHT THE STATE ASSIST AND EFFECTUATE AND THAT IS THIS. IS THIS [inaudible] THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION OR BC DC OR THE LOCAL AIR LOCAL COUNTIES FLOOD CONTROL AREAS HOW MIGHT WE MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE NEXT STEP WHATEVER THAT MAY BE ON THESE. RESILIENCE BY DESIGN. WELL I WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WITH THAT WE WOULD GET THROUGH THIS -- BUDGET CHANGE POSE A WOULD -- HELP DO THAT BECAUSE WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH THEM ON THESE PROJECTS THAT COASTAL CONSERVANCY -- DOES DO GRANT FUNDS IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST -- THAT CAN HELP THE LOCALS WITH THESE PROJECTS WE ALSO HAVE. AND I'M GOING COMMISSIONER WORK GROUP CALLED FINANCING THE FUTURE WHERE WERE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WAYS OF HOW WE'RE GONNA FINANCE THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE I AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY THAT. PROBABLY THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS IS GOING TO BE FINDING THE FUNDING TO DO THE ADAPTATION MEASURES IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED. SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT VARIOUS PUBLIC FINANCE EXPERTS AND SUCH TO LOOK AT VARIOUS MECHANISMS TO FINANCE THESE PROJECTS FROM SPECIAL FINANCING DISTRICTS TO GREEN BONDS -- THE AND SO WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN GETTING OUT OF OUR STUDIES BUT IT CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE QUIBBLE OVER THE R. O. I. B. AND FOUR TO ONE OR SIX TO ONE NO THAT'S OKAY. FINANCE -- ENDED UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST PUT A NOTE THAT THERE IS FUNDING. WITHIN THE COURSE PROTECTION COUNCIL -- FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE. TO CLIMATE CHANGE -- WHICH WOULD ASSIST THE THE COMMUNITIES AND AND THE COASTAL. AREAS SUCH AS ON DIRECTOR -- INS WITH FORGET TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM. LOVE THE COLLABORATION LOVE TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOVE THE POLICY GUIDANCE YEAH THE DADA DADA. ONE DO YOU PULL THE PLUG WHEN DO YOU GET THIS DIVERSE GROUP OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE AN DONE ANYTHING FOR FORTY YEARS. I MEAN I KNOW IT'S IT'S WHEN WHEN DO WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE SAID WE'VE GOT. TO WE'VE GOT TO A PLAN OR WILL. ADAPT -- IN YOUR COMMUNITY JUST BECAUSE WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED. THAT'S RIGHT IN THE SOME OF THESE SOME ORIGIN WE HAVE THIRTEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS AND WE'VE TARGETED THOSE FOR GRANTS. THE BIG KAHUNA BEING THE CITY OF LA. DOESN'T HAVE A A LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM. AND SO ALL OF THESE FRONTS WERE MAKING YOU KNOW WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF MAKING GREAT PROJECT -- PROGRESS AND MOVING FORWARD TO ACTUALLY REALIZE THESE LCP CERTIFYING THESE LC PEAS. THE HERE'S THE RUB. AS WE GO THROUGH THIS THIS PROCESS AND WE WE THEY DO THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS ONCE YOU PUT THE YOU KNOW A PEN TO PAPER ON A MAP. A THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE GETS CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOSS OF THEIR PROPERTY VALUES THERE HE THERE FEARFUL OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN A FUTURE THAT THE STATE'S GOING TO COME IN AND SEES OUR PROPERTY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN AND THE SORTS OF THINGS -- AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE PLANNING SIDE AND DEVELOPING THE POLICY STARTS GETTING REALLY DIFFICULT WE HAD A GREAT -- A LOT OF PUSH BACK ON OUR RESIDENTIAL ADAPTATION GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT WE HAVE AT THE HEAD OUT FOR A FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW. GETTING A PUBLIC INPUT ON IT. ON THE NOTION OF PLANNED RETREAT AND HOW -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE LOSS OF PROPERTY VALUES A LOSS OF THE TAX BASE AND THINGS LIKE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES WERE CONCERNED PARTICULAR THE REALTORS COMMUNITIES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THESE I THINK THIS IS AN EVOLUTION OF POLICY OVER TIME IT'S AT INCREMENTAL STEPS GOING FORWARD WE DON'T HAVE TO SOLVE IT ALL IN ONE SHOT I THINK. YOU KNOW WE GET. MAKE SOME PROGRESS ARE LCP WORK -- WITH REGARD TODAY MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THEY'RE INVULNERABLE AREAS WE DISCLOSE THAT -- THE THOSE VULNERABILITIES WE FOCUS ON THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THE GLUE THAT HOLDS OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD START THAT'S WHERE THE THE THE BANDS. BUT PLANNING AND DESIGN FOR THOSE THINGS NOT JUST THE NOT JUST THE ACTUAL PROJECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS. ARE OW AT MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TELL US THAT THEY NEED MONEY FOR PLANNING AND DESIGN OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE OF PROJECTS GOING FORWARD PARTICULARLY -- WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES UP AND DOWN THE COAST THESE ARE REALLY VULNERABLE MOST OF THEM ARE -- AT SEAL RISE ARE AT SEA LEVEL AND THEY'RE REAL IN THAT'S OF HUGE BIG TICKET ITEM -- TO MOVE THOSE BACK OFF THE COAST AND SMALLER DISTRICTS ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WE HAVE ONCE IN THE NUMBER IN THE BAY AREA THINK EIGHTEEN OF THE NINETEEN TREATMENT PLANTS ARE RIGHT THERE BY THE BAY THERE'S ONE IN EAST CONTRA COSTA. CENTER MONEY YET QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COM. I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR UPDATES AND THE LA -- FOR THE POSITIONING HERE. ON THE CHAIR. ZEROED IN ON ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WHICH RELATED TO THE LOCAL COASTAL PLANS YOU SAID THERE WERE THIRTEEN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVEN'T YET COME INTO COMPLIANCE -- BUT YOU SAID IT'S A GRADUAL PROCESS HOW DO YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM TO GET THESE DONE. AT THE GRANT PROGRAM HAS IS HAS BEEN A REALLY INCREDIBLE INCENTIVE TO BRING THOSE COMMUNITIES THOSE THOSE JURISDICTIONS IN WHO DON'T HAVE THE WE DON'T HAVE AN A LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM. AND SO I THERE'S BEEN GREAT PROGRESS MADE I AM REALLY CONFIDENT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE YOU KNOW. MOST OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS -- COME FORWARD AND GET A SORT OF GET OUT OF THE LCP CERTIFIED AND PRESUMABLY THOSE THAT ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS ARE LOOKING AT SEA LEVEL RISE IN ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY. HI BUT YOU'RE DOING GRANTS ALSO TO UPDATE PLANS -- IS THAT ALSO PRIORITY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UPDATING THEIR PLANS THE GRANT PROGRAM IS TO IT IS TO UPDATE THE LOOK IS FOCUSED ON UPDATING LOCAL COASTAL PLANS FOR CERTIFYING UNCERTIFIED AREAS AND SPECIFICALLY THE GRANTS REQUIREMENTS ARE TO ADDRESSED. SEAL RISE -- ADAPTATION CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PLANNING. IT'S SO YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. TWO THIRDS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES ARE AT RISK QUOTE. I THINK YOU SUGGEST TO THE TIME FRAME BUT I DIDN'T CATCH IT IS BY THE END OF THE OF THE CENTURY BY THE END OF THE CENTURY -- BUT IT COULD BE A MORE QUICKLY BASED ON SOME OF THE SITES WERE SEEING COMING OUT OF THE AYE XCELERATED AYE SHEET MELT AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO. AND AND AND IN COMBINATION WITH THE STAMPED UP STORMS WILL SEE MUCH MORE RUSSIAN OF OUR SANDY BEACHES AND OUR BLUFFS ALONG THE COASTLINE NICER PRESENTATION RECENTLY FROM THE M.. BLUE OCEAN ECONOMY PROJECT INTO MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE AND THEY HAD DONE SOME MAPPING OF CENTRAL COAST AREAS SHOWING. A SEA LEVEL RISE. COMING OVER HIGHWAY ONE BUTTON COACHING IN IN KEY TOURISM AREAS HAVE YOU DONE ANY MAPPING THAT LOOKS TO THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT OR LA -- WE DID HAVE A PRESENTATION AND RESOURCES A WEEK OR SO AGO THAT. THAT HAD SOME BROAD FIGURES BUT DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DIAL IN AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT WAKE UP CALL FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IF THEY SEE HOW THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES. ARE TO BE IMPACTED. AND THE FIRST STEP OF OF THIS PLANNING PROCESS IS THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT PIECE AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE WERE AT THE DO THE DEEPDIVE OF DENTAL FIND THE AREAS THAT ARE GONNA BE VULNERABLE AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT VULNERABILITIES IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. BUT ALSO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THAT OF THAT SO IT'S IT'S BEING DONE. ON THE LOCAL BASIS. IF OKAY AND THAT'LL IT BY CITY OR BY JURIST AND THEN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT LOOKING AT IMPACTS TO BROAD CATEGORIES OF BUSINESS INDUSTRY TOURISM. YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO POTENTIAL JOB LOSS IN LAW LOST REVENUES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN SOME THAT HAVE DONE THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAKE UP CALL TO TRANSLATE INTO. MICRO A CONNIE'S OF JOBS LOSS LOSS OF PROPERTY REVENUES -- PROPERTY TAX REVENUES SO. THE THE THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT SEA LEVEL RISE IS A FUNCTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT YOUR PERCEPTION SLOWLY. AND IN YOUR VIEW IT'S REAL. UPSET. IT IS REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK. AND HAVE YOU RESPOND TO THOSE WHO SAY. I AM IT CHANGES THE HOAX. WELL THE SCIENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AND IN A WAR HI BUT WE BASE OUR DECISIONS ON THE FAX GOOD SCIENCE RULE OF LAW AND A GOOD DOSE OF COMMON SENSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GERMAN VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE IN AT FOR YOUR WORK IN THE END IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE -- THIS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CHALLENGE THAT I FEEL THAT WE HAVE IS WERE WORKING IN SILOS. GOOD PROGRAMS NOT WELL FUNDED CANDIDLY GOOD WORK IT'S HAPPENED WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. BUT THERE IS NO ONE OVERSEER IF YOU WILL OF ALL OF THE DASH PROGRAMS. SO THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS WITH ITS TO THE CONSERVANCY. COMMISSION THE CDC IN A SLEW OF OTHERS. CONTENT I HAVE AND WHY I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS IS IT'S GOING TO BE ALL HANDS ON DECK. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS RUN THROUGH RESOURCES. YES AS AN OVERSEER IN BEING ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH. WOULD LOOK AT WOULD HELP THE LA -- IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THIS AS A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES. MOVING FORWARD ON NOT IDENTICAL BUT SIMILAR ISSUES AND HOW WE CAN COMBINE OUR EFFORTS -- IN THE IN ALSO FIGURE OUT WHO'S DOING WHAT AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE FUNDED. IT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT. AND SO WE'VE OF WITH ALL THEY ARE AGENCY PARTNERS WE FOUGHT WE WE DEVELOP THE SINGLE RISE LEADERSHIP TEAM WHERE WE MEET REGULARLY AND TALK ABOUT JUST THOSE ISSUES TO TALK ABOUT -- WHO'S ARE PARTNERING WITH THE OPC FOR EXAMPLE TO GO OUT AND DO LOCAL OF GOVERNMENT WORKSHOPS UP AND DOWN THE COAST -- TO CONTINUE OUR PUBLIC OUTRAGE ON SEAL RICE -- EDUCATION AND ALSO STILL RISE ADAPTATION EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE SO WE ARE WORKING WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER -- AND TRY IN COORDINATING TOGETHER SO WE WE WE REALIZE THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND THAT THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN. RESPONSIBILITIES BUT HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER -- TO IT'S TO REALIZE EFFICIENCIES AND REALLY GOOD OUTCOMES SO I I IT WORK WE'RE WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS -- THERE AND WE CONTINUE. TO IF I COULD JUST AMPLIFY THOSE REMARKS I'VE BEEN IN COASTAL MANAGEMENT FOR GOING ON THIRTY YEARS NOW. AND WE'VE ALWAYS WORKED -- AS SISTER AGENCIES TOGETHER -- BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS LEVEL OF INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION -- AS I'VE SEEN WITH THE RISING SEA LEVEL ISSUE BOTH THROUGH -- THE THE VARIOUS MEANS WE HAD BUT JUST ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS GOING BACK AND FORTH -- AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- AND HOW WE CAN WORK BETTER TOGETHER AND SO I I THINK ON THIS TOPIC. THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM BUT I THINK WE ARE AT LEAST IN THE COST OF COMMUNITY I THINK WE ARE REALLY WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. AND AS I MENTIONED FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY THAT'S KIND OF WE SEE OUR ROLE AS TRYING TO BRING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS FOLKS THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES DOING THEIR ADAPTATION PLANNING. THE VARIOUS -- REGIONAL ENTITIES LIKE THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION. COMMISSION -- IN THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND THEN THE THE STATE AGENCIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL COR DATING AND HAVE ONE REGIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT WE ARE DOING. ADAPTATION PLANNING ON SO WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU RAISE IT IS ABOUT. YEAH IT LOOK IN AT WHAT I WOULD SAY -- TWO CHAIRS AT WHEN WE GET THAT LARGE SCALE PLAN RIGHT. AND ACTUALLY START MOVING FORWARD ON TRYING TO SECURE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WHATEVER THAT SOURCE MAY BE. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER I SPECIAL AND DOLLARS ARE FLOWING TO BE WHAT AND I APPRECIATE THE EVEN DOING THAT -- INDICTED ALTERNATE THROW STONES AGAIN ON THE AD HOC BASIS OF SAYING THAT WE CAN START GETTING -- BUTTONED UP TOGETHER. BUT I WOULD THINK YOU'D BE NEEDING SOME TYPE OF FORMAL PROCESS IT ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE PRIORITIES ARE GONNA BE. UP TO THE CHAIR RESEARCH. EXACT DIRECTOR THAN WITH ACTIVITY HERE FROM FINANCE IN LA -- WITH THAT SO. YEAH I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON SETTING PRIORITIES IS REALLY GOING THE IMPORT PARTICULAR RELATES TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. DOING A SURVEY AN INVENTORY OF THOSE THOSE OF IT ACROSS THE EVERY JURISDICTION A WHAT WHAT'S OUR PRIORITY AS FAR AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT ADAPTATION PROJECTS TO MOVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OUT OF HARM'S WAY THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE. PROBABLY THE FIRST STEP I THINK IT IN THE IN THIS PLANNING PROCESS AND ALSO A WITH ADAPTATION -- PROJECTS. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS -- WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SACKING WE'RE GONNA HAVE COME EGGMAN COMING UP IN -- JULY A WORKSHOP FOCUSED ON SEAL RISE AT TATIAN PLANNING BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING INTO SOME. YOU KNOW STICKY ISSUES AT LOW WHIMS BECOMES A POLITICAL ISSUE -- WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REAL ESTATE AND DEVELOPMENT SO -- TO HELP US ADD TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR CONSTRAINTS ARE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS ARE AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ADVANCE -- THIS WILL RISE AT PATIENT PLANNING GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THE POLITICS AROUND IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. AND WE WE'VE ALSO FOUND IN OUR VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT SOMETIMES ON THE SHOW AND THERE IS NO. FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY THAT IS DOING AT THAT THE LANDOWNER IS THE DEFAULT AND IT MAY BE A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR LOCAL FOLKS WHO DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PROTECTING A BUNCH OF FOLKS. BEHIND THEM. AND OFTEN IN THE BAY AREA IT IT'S STATE INFRASTRUCTURE -- LIKE HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE THAT IS THE DEFAULT PROTECTION FOR THE AREAS BEHIND THEM BUT IS CALTRANS DOING PLANNING THAT'S LOOKING AT THE WHOLE REGION FOR AN INTEGRATED PLAN. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR FACILITIES THAT'S THEIR MANDATES SO WE ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THESE -- VERY SENSE THESE AND AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INTEGRATED LOCK. AND I WOULD BE SAYING WOULD LIKE TO IF IT'S THROUGH THE CHAIR WITH DEPARTMENT HAS IT ALL OUT. SOMETIMES WHEN THERE IS A MANDATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING RIGHT. IT PUTS THE BEING THE MONEY. TO GET IT MOVED QUICKER -- AND SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF CALTRANS AT LEAST IN DISTRICT. FOUR WHICH IS AT YOUR WORK ASKING OURS IN MY REGION. IS THAT ON THIS IS THE FUNDING IS NOT THERE AND IT IS PROJECT BY PROJECT WHEN THE FIRE HITS. RIGHT LIKE WE SAW. IN MARIN CITY AND YOUR TEMPER ON WHEN THAT FLOODS. IN THERE'S A FOCUS AND THEN OTHER FIRES CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICTS SO. THAT FROM THE FANS SURE JUST STOP WITH SAY THAT YOUR STATEMENT IS -- SO NOTED I'LL TAKE IT BACK I I WILL SAY THAT WHEN WE EVALUATE THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EVERY EVER FALLEN INTO THE SPRING AND ALSO -- EVALUATE THE ON GOING BASELINE WE DO -- COORDINATE INTERNALLY AND AND TRY TO HAVE A STATEWIDE -- DO YOU AND WOULD ALSO. I DON'T SPEAK FOR RESOURCE AGENCY BUT I KNOW AS THE ENTITY OVER MANY OF THESE AGENCIES TO COORDINATE WITH THOSE ENTITIES AS WELL I CAST A GLANCE QUESTION BECAUSE COMMISSION AND BUSH PROTECTION COUNCIL. YEAH I I THINK COORDINATION IS A REALLY IMPORTANT KEY BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT AND SEE IF THERE'S GUIDANCE WE CAN GIVE I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT LEGISLATURE CAN DO. TERMS OF BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT TARGETING WHEN IT ALLOCATES MONEY TO A PARTICULAR AGENCY FOR PARTICULAR ROLE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN. LBC IS BEEN GIVEN FUNDING FIRST VERY SIMILAR THINGS AS THE CONSERVANCY IS DOING IT SO IT WAS SO YOU KNOW WE COULD PROBABLY SEND MORE CLEAR SIGNALS IF WE WANT TO DELINEATE ROLES -- I THINK THAT COORDINATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS ESSENTIAL AS WELL AS WE'VE HEARD IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY IT'S A LOT EASIER BECAUSE IT'S A BATH TUB AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IF YOU DO THIS ON THE SIDE IT MAY AFFECT THE SIDE. AND THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER BUT BUT THERE ARE THOSE IN A RELATED AFFECTS ALONG THE OUTSIDE COAST TO IF YOU PUT UP A WALL IN. ONE YEAH IT WILL AFFECT POTENTIALLY THE BEACH IN A NEIGHBORING AREA AND AND IT PROBABLY IS EASIER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO VIEW THEIR OWN ACTIONS MORE IN A VACUUM SYSTEM MORE THAT REGIONAL COORDINATION IS PROBABLY. OVERALL THE STATE CAN REALLY TAKE -- OUTSIDE OF THE BAY AS WELL FOR SOME OF THOSE COORDINATED IMPACTS THE BRANCH HAS DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM WHICH TECHNICALLY IS HOUSED IN THE EPA BUT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WAS. REALLY RUN FROM THE RESOURCE AGENCY BUT THAT'S A HORIZONTAL -- DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE STATE AGENCIES. COINCIDENTALLY THE CHAIR HAS A BILL ON A DAY A CHIEF ADAPTATION OFFICER WHICH WOULD BE PARKED IN OPR WHICH WOULD HELP WITH THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF WE'RE TALKING WHAT THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN. THE STATE AND THE REGION'S AND LOCALITIES SO THAT THAT FLOW OF INFORMATION AND FUNDS TO COMMEND CHIEF -- CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE LA -- JUST REFER TO THIS BUT MY QUESTION. IN YOU THIS MAY BE IS PROJECT BY PROJECT COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY BUT SOME PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS THINK A SEA WALL. IS THE SOLUTION. ONE IF YOU HAVE ANY COM IS THERE ANY. STATE OF THE ART OR OR MORE -- POLICY ORIENTATION EITHER OF YOUR AGENCIES ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF SEA WALLS I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S THE EASY FIX. WELL I CAN START OFF THE OF SEA WALLS DESTROYED BEACHES. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. AND BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT EVERY. THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTEXT UP AND DOWN THE COAST DIFFERENT SEARCHES CIRCUMSTANCES THERE CERTAIN URBAN AREAS WHERE ARMORING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE ADAPTATION STRATEGY. AND WE JUST HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEAR OUT YOU KNOW THE CITY OF LONG BEACH -- DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO -- AND SO THERE THERE ARE AT SEA WALLS HAVE THEIR PLACE AS PART OF AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY IT'S JUST THAT. IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SEQUELS ONE OR YOU'VE GOT TO MITIGATE YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT WELL WHAT OTHER A WHAT ONE OF THE AREAS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RETREAT. TO RETAIN OUR BEACHES AND TO YOU KNOW TO IT TO FEED TO HAVE THAT SETTLEMENT COMING OFFER BLUFFS AND FEEDING THOSE BEACHES AND READERS HIM. LOOK AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST TO SEAL RISE WE'RE JUST GONNA LAYS EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA LOSE SOME BEACHES BECAUSE OF THE AT THE AT ALL THE ADVANCING. SEAL RISE AND ROAD UNIT OF THIS HAPPENING SO QUICKLY. BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO -- TO PRESERVE OUR BEACHES UP IN AN ECHO THREE NOURISHMENT AND OTHER -- STRATEGIES. YEAH IN THE IN THE BARRIO OF WE ARE A BIT MORE SHELTERED AND SO THEREFORE -- IT IS POSSIBLE IT WOULD IMPOSSIBLE THE HARD IN THE ENTIRE SHORELINE OF THE BABY BUT WOULD THAT BE A GOOD IDEA IN. IN TERMS OF THE THE WETLANDS. PROBABLY NOT AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT NATURAL SHORELINE. CAN ACTUALLY HELP PROTECT THE DEVELOPMENT BEHIND THEM SO RESTORATION PROJECTS -- CAN REDUCE FLOODING IN INUNDATION OF THE DEVELOPED AREAS AND MAYBE IF YOU HAVE TO BUILD A LEVEE YOU BUILD IT LOWER. A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THE SOUTH BAY THE SHORELINE -- RESTORATION OF THE OLD SALT PONDS -- THAT. ACTUALLY PROTECT DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE THAT'S SUBSIDED AROUND TWELVE FEET FROM HISTORIC WATER ASKED BACK WHEN IT WAS THE VALLEY OF HEART'S DESIRE -- AND SO -- IF DO THE RESTORATION PROJECT WE'RE ACTUALLY HELPING TO PROTECT DEVELOPMENT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE IN THIS ALSO CAN A ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION BECAUSE THAT'S GREEN CARBON THAT'S SEQUESTERING CARBON IN THESE AREAS SO. SO WE HAVE A FOCUS ON THAT -- BUT IT IS TRUE THAT SOME AREAS -- IF THAT ISN'T JUST GOING TO WORK AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE SHORELINE ARMING SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT AT BOTH MODELS. OKAY THERE'S NO ACTION THIS COULD BE TAKEN HERE DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES -- HEARING WE HELD IT OPEN ON MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH SO. THANK YOU WE'LL CLOSE THAT MATTER AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. ELEVEN THIS WILL BE BE DC'S METRO CENTER. THE CONTINUING SAGA THIRD TIME'S A CHARM [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] YES SO -- THIS IS IS THIS THE THIRD -- BUDGET CHANGE OPPOSE ALL FOR OUR AGENCY TO MOVE FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW IN THE CIVIC CENTER IN THE STATE BUILDING. TO THE REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING THAT WAS -- ACQUIRED BY THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO BE A REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS AND NOW -- HAS OF THE MTC THE ERROR DISTRICT -- THE SOCIALLY SO SEE ASIAN OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS AND ALSO HAS OTHER -- IT -- AGENCIES WE WORK WITH INCLUDING THE ESTUARY PARTNERSHIP AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TRAIL -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE IN OUR BEST INTERESTS AND OF THE STATE TO MOVE AND JOIN OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS -- THE WHICH WE ARE WORKING WITH CONSTANTLY -- AND SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME MOVING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE AGENCIES AND SO -- THIS IS THE FINAL PROPOSAL WERE HOPING THAT WOULD -- FUND US FROM -- FUND US TO MOVE TO THE THE THE NEW HEADQUARTERS AND OUR EXISTING FACILITIES WOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT NEEDS TO EXPAND -- AND WOULD OTHERWISE NEED TO LOOK OUTSIDE -- FOR OTHER REAL ESTATE IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. FINANCE FINAL FINAL HERE. LAST REQUEST FOR THIS ISSUE. I DO YEAH WE WE HAD SOME CONCERNS IN THIS IN PRIOR YEARS WHEN IT'S COME BEFORE YOU -- GIVEN THAT THE LOCATION THE COMMISSION'S IN RIGHT NOW IS RELATIVELY LOW COST FOR THE STATE IN THIS WOULD BE HIGHER COSTS BUT OVER THE ITERATIONS WE HAVE NOW SEEN -- DOCUMENTATION THAT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES INDEED NEED ADDITIONAL SPACE AND WILL INDEED MOVE THAT SO THAT KIND OF HELPS THAT PENCIL OUT FOR THE STATE. THE MULTIPLE. REQUESTS ALSO SOMETIMES RAISE CONCERNS BUT AT THIS IS RELATIVELY MODEST SO IF THIS IS THE SELF CONTAINED AT THAT STOP CONTINUING MOVE. CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE MATTER OPEN -- AND DEAL WITH IT. NEXT MONTH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. I WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION LEARN MORE ABOUT. THE 400-580-00800 AND FORTY THREE ACRES OF LAND THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. OWNS [inaudible] PARTICULARLY. ONE HERE ABOUT THE FIFTY FIVE ACRES FORCE LAND BUT THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF NON FORCE LAND. WHERE ARE THEY AND WHAT'S THE PLAN? GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MY NAME IS JENNIFER L CASSIE I AM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WITH ME IS CALLING CONNOR OUR ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER -- FOR THE COMMISSION SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY ABOUT WHAT ARE THESE SCHOOL LANDS AND WHAT ARE THEY BEING PLANNED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL LANDS -- ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESERT -- THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES -- THAT YOU REFERENCED MINUS THE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF FORESTED SCHOOL DANCE. AND FRANKLY -- BASED ON STATE POLICIES LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES -- AND OUR STRATEGIC PLAN WE ARE FOCUS SEEN THOSE PARCELS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESERT -- FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT -- AND ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER -- TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT CAN HELP THE STATE MEET ITS CLIMATE GOALS FROM AN ENERGY PERSPECTIVE -- AND SO THAT'S WE'VE -- OR ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE DESERT RENEWABLE -- ENERGY CONSERVATION PLAN FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHERE WE REALLY STUDIED -- AND WORKED WITH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO UNDERSTAND OUR PARCELS BETTER -- AND ALSO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAND EXCHANGES WERE WE COULD CONSOLIDATE THOSE DESERT SCHOOL LANDS FOR EITHER RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT OR AS MITIGATION LANDS TO FACILITATE -- RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ELSEWHERE -- SO THAT'S BEEN OUR GOAL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE STILL ACTIVELY WORK TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT IN THIS ONE PERMANENT POSITION GOING FORWARD IS GOING. TO ASSIST WITH THAT AMP IT UP. BUT ACTUALLY THE THAT REQUEST BEFORE YOU TODAY IS REALLY FOCUSED ON OUR FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF FORESTED SCHOOL LANDS. AND WE ARE REQUESTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE SCHOOL LANDING FUND AND ONE PERMANENT POSITION WE INTEND TO HIRE A CONSULTANT TO INVENTORY ARE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF FORESTED SCHOOL LANDS. AND THE DEDICATED STAFF POSITION TO MANAGE THIS CONTRACT AND THE LATER BILL TO FORCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FROM THE RESULTING DATA THE INVENTORY WILL INCLUDE DATA ON HEALTH SPECIES SIZE AND DENSITY OF OUR FORESTED LAND. UNDER OUR JURISDICTION AND THIS IS REALLY A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FOREST CLIMATE ACTION TEAM AND THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOREST CARBON PLAN -- SO SO PART OF THAT IS IT ON WE'RE NEW. NORMAL NOW THAT WE WANT TO MANAGE OUR LAND BEFORE IN THE OLD BATTLE DAYS WHICH ISSUE SORT OF SIT THERE AND LET THE TREES DO WHATEVER THEY DO NOW. WE NEED TO TH AND WE NEED TO TO PRESCRIBE BURNSWE NEED TO MANAGE THAT ARE YOU THINKING. AS A AS AN ASSET WE WE CAN. CREATE IF IT'S IN THE WATERSHED WE CAN CREATE MORE WATER RETENTION BETTER OF BREAKING THE IN THE FIRE THAT IS A A STATEWIDE ASSET THAT'S VALUABLE FOR ALL OF US WORK. WE CAN PUT UP CABINS AND HAVE PEOPLE CO THERE AND AND YOU KNOW HAVE A HOLIDAY YOU DON'T KNOW NOW WHERE IT MEAN I I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE ARE ARE THE ADJACENT TO PARK SAID THEY JUST OUT IN THE WE WE I MERRILY IN THE IN. NORTHERN EASTERN PART OF CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY ARE -- ISOLATED PARCELS OF ANYWHERE AS LARGEST SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES ARE LAST DEPENDING ON THE HISTORY -- OF THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF THOSE LANDS -- AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW I MEAN AT THE GOAL IS ACTUALLY NOT TO DEVELOP FOUR CABINS AND THAT SORT OF THING WE REALLY WANT. TO BE A PRO ACTIVE A MANAGER AND RESPONSIBLE MANAGER OF OUR OF OUR FORESTED LANDS AND SO IT'S REALLY HOW DO WE RESPONSIBLY MANAGE THAT TO INCREASE AND ENHANCE THE HEALTH OF THOSE FOR SAID LANDS -- AND AS WELL AS LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE HOW WE CAN -- CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES IN TERMS OF MANAGING THOSE FOR CARBON SINKS ARE OTHERS AND WILL BE WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE -- AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT REALLY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND A LOT OF OTHER LANDS THAT THEY MANAGE -- THAT SURROUND OURS. HELLO YOU HAVE A COMMENT NO CONCERNS OKAY THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE HIS BUDGET I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER.

AT THE END OF LAST FISCAL YEAR THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS DECIDED NOT TO ENTER INTO NEW LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH US IN ANOTHER STATE AGENCY IN THAT BUILDING -- WHICH TO SAY LEASE WAS A INCREDIBLY UNPLEASANT SURPRISE FOR US IS WE'VE BEEN IN THAT BUILDING FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES FIND. IN NEW OFFICE SPACE FOR THE AGENCY'S HEADQUARTERS WITHIN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AS OUR CURRENT OFFICE LOCATION. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAYING IN THE VICINITY OF OUR CURRENT OFFICE LOCATION. BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL FOR ALL THE OPERATIONAL CAPACITY OF OUR OF THE COMMISSION STAFF THAT LOCATION ALLOWS OUR EMPLOYEES USE A WIDE VARIETY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. TO GET TO WORK WE HAVE EMPLOYEES LIVE ALL OVER SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND A TRANSIT OR WALK OR BIKE TO WORK. AND IT'S CRITICAL TO KEEP THAT OFFICE LOCATION. TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT OUR STAFF GOING THE FUTURE IT ALSO MEETS THE STATE'S GOALS IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS OF REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH THE USE OF TRANSIT AND BIKING AND WALKING. THE LOCATION IS ALSO A REALLY REALLY IN SUPPORT AT NO ESSENTIAL FOR ACCESSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE SERVE -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT ARE NOR CENTRAL. DISTRICT OFFICES UP COLOCATED NOT HEADQUARTERS OFFICE AND THAT OFFICE SERVES. A SAM A TALE SAN FRANCISCO MORAN AND SONOMA COUNTIES. IN ADDITION WE ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO BE LOCATED IN A COASTAL COUNTY. AND ANYWHERE WITHIN THE BAY AREA COURSE HAS REALLY. EXPENSIVE -- OFFICE LEASE SPACE AS YOU ALL KNOW. SO THE COMMISSIONS -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO THOSE TWENTIES GOVERNOR BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THE ADDITIONAL ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER MOVING CONSTRUCTION COST. IN ADDITION THE NEW OFFICE SPACE INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL -- SQUARE FOOTAGE IT COULD BE SUBLEASE TO ANOTHER STATE AGENCY. AND THE GS IS ACTIVELY SEEKING -- SAID. STATE AGENCY TENANTS TO SUBLEASE THAT ADDITIONAL SPACE. AND DTS ESTIMATES OF WE WE MOVED INTO THE OFFICE. BY THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WE'RE NOT GONNA START PAYING RENT OF COURSE UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- MY CHIEF DEPUTIES HANDS HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS -- INTERNALLY FOR LAST. SEVERAL MONTHS NOW THANK YOU. FINANCE GET THE MESSAGE SENATE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL OUR YES AND OUR STAFF HAS MET WITH MANY STAFF AND AND YOUR IT'S SO NOTED THIS RIGHT. HELLO YEAH I WOULDN'T KNOWN AS PART OF THE CONCERN WITH THIS IS WE DIDN'T GET THE DETAIL BUT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN REALLY RESPONSIVE AND PROVIDING. THE DETAIL THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN IN A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WOULD GIVE US PAUSE HERE'S AT THIS NEW LOCATION IS LARGER THAN IS NEEDED BY THE COMMISSION AND HAS ACCESS SPACE. BUT THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY DID THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND IT'S JUST REALLY HARD IN SAN FRANCISCO TO FIND OFFICE SPACE SO IT WILL BE KEY FOR DIGESTIVE FIND A SUB TENANT TO TED TAKE OVER THAT ADDITIONAL A NEEDED SPACE IN ORDER THEM. TO THEM MAKE THIS WORK FOR THE STATE BUT THEY HAVE INDICATED THEY HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO DO SO WELLS LEAST STATUTORILY THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO LIKE THE CDC THAT'S THEY HAVE JUST HAVE TO BE ON COASTAL. THREE NO SO WE HAVE THAT LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM OKAY -- IT'S IN HOLD MATTER OPEN. A THIS IS THE ON THE FINAL MILE FOR MATTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANYBODY. POLICE COST ENTHUSIASTIC COMMENT. WE WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING -- OUR WORK IS DONE WILL HOLD IT OPEN SEE YOU GUYS LATER NEXT MONTH.

LOCAL AND NON PROFIT PARTNERS. AND WITH THAT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS STRUCTURE. OKAY -- COMMENTS YEAH JUSTICE% THIS IS QUITE A BIT OF PROP SIXTY MANY ANNUAL RECALL FROM EARLIER HEARING THAT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF DETAIL PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO EVEN THIS AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT THE COMMISSION -- THE BOARD RATHER HAS PROVIDED IN YOUR AGENDA IS QUITE HELPFUL -- AND NOTHING JUMPED OUT AT US AS INCONSISTENT WITH THE BOND OR RAISING ANY CONCERNS. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS I WAS ON THE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS JUST TO CHEER OR THIRTIES. IN THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT BUT HE DOES WE HAVE ALMOST HALF OF ITS SEVENTY IS SORT OF A EXCEPT. ARE IN THE WORK RIGHT WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC PROJECTS ARE LINED OUT -- REQUISITION DEVELOPMENT FOR REGIONAL CONSERVATION AND THEN THE SEVENTY MILLION IS THAT A TIMING THING BECAUSE WE WE DID THIS AND OUR CHARGE RIGHT RIGHT. IT IS THE TIMING -- ISSUE THE SEVENTY MILLION THAT WE RECEIVED ARE YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE SEE LAST YEAR -- YES THAT WAS IT ACTUALLY WENT TO SEVERAL PROGRAMS AS WELL WITH W. SEE THE AND WE WORKED ON GETTING OUR GUIDELINES TOGETHER WHICH DID NOT COME TOGETHER UNTIL NOVEMBER -- SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AND THEN -- THE ON THE CLIMATE PREPAREDNESS I'M STILL WORKING THROUGH MY THE REPORT FROM THE TIMBER FORCED THE FORESTRY FOLKS I MEAN THEY'RE USING A HOT THIS IS THE HIGH SIERRA. THE WATERSHED RESTORATION THINNING OF FOR US. THEY'RE LOOKING AT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. NUMBER SO. SIXTY MILLION IS RIGHT. A START. A START -- CAN YOU. SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW YOU THINK THIS THE SIERRA NEVADA AND THE CASCADE MOUNTAINS VARIETY OF WORKED IT'S THEIR JUST START -- HOW MIGHT WE HEAR BACK FROM YOUR BOARD AFTER THIS WORK IS DONE? I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING. TO WITH A LOT OF ADAPTATION WORK TO DO A LOT OF FORCE. WORK TO DO AND WHAT THE QUESTION ALWAYS COMES OUT TO US BANG FOR OUR BUCK ARE WE HOW DOES IT HOW DOES. HOW DOES THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD WORK TOGETHER WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO'S GOT A REPORT OUT AND WITH THE FORCE PEOPLE AND WHAT THE? WATERSHED PEOPLE WHOMEVER THEY MAY BE THAT THAT WORKS SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND WE SAY THIS IS THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE. ABOVE OR A BILL. SINCE WE JUST DROPPED. A BILLION DOLLARS A FIX THAT UP YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU COULD MANAGE THAT HIGH SIERRA LAND. BETTER. RATE -- LAKE WAS TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY BY SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS W. C. B. CHORD IT'S A LOT WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ARE ON THE SIERRA NEVADA LEADERSHIP FORUM FOR THE FOR THE ZERO PROJECT THAT CAL FIRE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING -- WE ARE PARTICIPATING THE SOUTHERN ZERO LEADERSHIP FORUM NEXT WEEK AND SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE GROUPS AN OPPORTUNITY IS THAT WE ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE. AND WILL BE ABLE TO DO PROJECTS CONSISTENTLY. COMPATIBILITY AND ALSO TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW MAKE OUR FUNDING GO A LOT FARTHER MET LEVERAGING OUR FUNDING WITH OTHER FUNDING AS WELL. AND THEN I HANDED OUT I HAD THE SURGEON OURS HIM THAT OUT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE WANT TO DO. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS FUNDING WHERE THE FOR THE WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING. AND THE SUCCESSES THAT WERE MAKING ALONG THE WAY SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO MEMBERS QUESTIONS OF DOCTOR DONNELLY. OKAY THIS IS [inaudible] CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A WELCOME DIRECTOR -- QUESTION ABOUT. WE WE TALKED TO THE SECRETARY RESOURCE ABOUT THIS IN A FEW HEARINGS BACK BUT THIS WOULD OVERALL PROMISED AROUND PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND THE EQUITY DRIVEN INTENTIONS BUT ALSO. THIS COMMUNITY ACCESS PIECE. TRYING TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU WHAT PROGRESS YOU THINK WE'RE MAKING WE GOT A GOOD SIGNAL FROM THE SECRETARY. THAT HE THOUGHT -- WE WERE GETTING -- GOOD PROJECTS MOVING BUT NOT IN. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS SORT OF TENSION AROUND. WHAT? WHETHER WE CAN DO STAND ALONE OR WE HAVE TO SORT OF PACKAGE THESE THINGS TOGETHER IN TERMS OF ACCESS. WHEN W VOTED? ON THIS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WENT THROUGH AND SB FIVE IN. YOU KNOW -- STEP FOR NOT THIS COMMITTEE VEGAS NATURI SO ONE I MEAN I I SORT OF FELT LIKE THE POLICY INTENTION WAS TO FIND A FRAMEWORK THAT -- ALLOWED NIMBLE USE OF FUNDS IN THAT WAY BUT DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE DOING MORE OF THAT HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR YOUR BUDGET I THINK AT LEAST STARTING OUT -- FOR THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WE'RE ALLOWING UP COMMUNITY ACCESS. AND I THINK THAT'S A START YOU WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT IS GOING FORWARD BUT ANOTHER THING THEY WERE DOING IS THAT WE NEED TO REACH THOSE AREAS WHERE THAT KIND OF FUNDING IN THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS WOULD BE GENERATED. AND I THINK I MEAN THAT'S I DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE HOLDING A PUBLIC WORKSHOP. DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF LOS ANGELES TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW LET FOLKS KNOW WHO WCBS WHAT KIND OF FUNDING WE HAVE HOW CAN WE HELP THEM IN THE KINDS OF PROJECTS. NOT ONLY THAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO YOU KNOW -- PER UP FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW GET PEOPLE OUTDOORS GET I'M GONNA MOVING GET HIM. CAM THINKING ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF AND YOU KNOW YOU NEED WE IS A STATE AGENCY AND I FEEL AS A AS A BOARD STAFF WE NEED TO GO OUT AND REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULDN'T. NORMALLY OR TRADITIONALLY HAVE NOT REACHED AND SO. YEAH I I COMPLETELY AGREE ME THE PROMISE OF ALL THIS TO ME IS. WHAT WE DO IS WE SHOULD OF WILDNESS IN AND ALL OUR LIVES THAT'S IT THAT'S THE GREAT? WEALTH OF THIS STATE RIGHT THAT YOU'RE AND ACTUALLY FEEL. WHAT WHAT WILDERNESS IS EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN CANOGA PARK IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY OR IF YOU LIVE IN YOU KNOW -- AND URBAN POPULATION BUT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW BLUE HERON ESTUARY NEARBY OR WHATEVER MAY BE I MEAN YOU SIR TO WAKE PEOPLE UP WITH THAT BUT DO YOU THINK IS THAT 5% STRUCTURE AROUND YOUR GRANT MAKING PROCESS IS THAT IN IS THAT YOUR GUIDELINES AROUND THIS RIGHT NOW AND IS. THE WORKSHOPS ARE LOOKING AT STRUCTURE IN THAT WAY LIKE IS THAT THE RIGHT. FRAME WE DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL I MEAN THIS IS A GUIDANCE AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE EVEN SO YOU GAVE US AND YOU KNOW WILL LOOK TO SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT IN EXISTING GRANTS INTO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A NEED IN THE SHORT TERM. TO ACTUALLY DO STAND ALONE GRANT SOLICITATIONS FOR THAT MONEY GOOD TO SEE YOU THINK MAYBE WE CAN SURFACED TO SOME OF THESE PROJECT IDEAS FOR WHAT STAND ALONE MIGHT LOOK LIKE THROUGH THIS WORKSHOP PROCESS OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN YES I'D HEARD OF LEASE OR JUST. RIGHT I THINK WE CAN I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN OUTLINE AND ARTICULATE IN A STRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE FORGET INSURANCE TO AND WE'RE DOING BOTH THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE KNOW SOME SOLICITATIONS ARE OUT. AND YOU'VE GOT THAT 5% THERE BUT OKAY GOOD SHOULD THE CREATIVITY AND THAT'S GOOD TIMING I'M DONE LAUGHING. THANK YOU. PERFECT FOR WE THIS IS NO ACTIONS REQUIRED HERE WE KEPT THE MATTER OPEN FROM MARCH SEVENTH [inaudible] SO. WE'LL CLOSE MATTER RATE THANK YOU. THIS IS NOW IT'S TIME. FOR PARKS AND RECREATION -- THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN CONTINUE ON OUR PROP SIXTY THEME. THIS IS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR FOURTEEN POSITIONS. FOR IMPROVING AND EXPANDING THE STATE AND LOCAL PARKS. QUITE A BIT LOCAL PARKS THANK YOU. DIRECTOR MAN GET RIGHT. YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'M LEE SMOG AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION -- FIRST BY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT YOUR LEADERSHIP PARTICULARLY WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WITH THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND SB -- FIVE SO OUR PIECE OF PROPOSITION -- SIXTY EIGHT WHEN WE'RE OUT TALKING ABOUT IT WE REALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT INCLUDE SOME OF THE STRONGEST LANGUAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S EVER PUT FORWARD INTO THE WORLD. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PARK PER COMMUNITIES AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE ON THAT WE PLAY AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. ON THE COMMUNITIES HAVE RECEIVED VERY POSITIVELY -- IT'S HARD IT'S ALL THE LARGEST PARK BONDING CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY SO -- WE'VE NEVER QUITE BEEN AS WELL POSITIONED AS WE ARE TODAY TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE AREAS. IN SUMMARY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE PARK BOND --% WAS DESIGNATED TO GO TOWARDS -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS -- AND ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION GOES OUT TO THE THE COMMUNITIES THAT LOCAL ASSISTANCE. OUR FIRST FOCUS ON THIS WAS REALLY TO STAND UP GUIDELINES AND PRINCIPLES GOVERNING HOW WE'RE GOING -- TO DESIGNATE THOSE FUNDS OUT INTO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE I'VE ACTUALLY GOT OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR -- OF OF THE GRANTS PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN KIND OF THE FORWARD FACE OF US ENGAGING HIMSELF WITH THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND WERE OUTLINING THE GUIDELINES WE'VE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE INTENDANTS -- OUR FIRST ARE WE ALWAYS FOR IT FIRST WORRY THAT WE HOLD A LISTENING SESSION AN ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS AND COMMUNITIES DON'T SHOW UP -- SORT VERY PLEASED THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IT'S ALSO GIVEN US A BETTER SENSE OF KIND OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND GETTING A LOT OF EXCITEMENT OUT THERE SO FOLKS REALIZE THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM AND THAT THEY CAN LEAN IN AND THEY'LL APPLY AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE USE SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY HAS -- THREE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS ONE WOULD BE -- THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT IT'S REALLY FOR PROGRAM DELIVERING -- BUT I'D REALLY CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THERE'S FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION REALLY KIND OF FOCUSING MORE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SPECIFICALLY IT STATE PARKS. AND THEN ALSO ABOUT FIFTY ONE MILLION IN PROGRAMMING AND THAT IS THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE PUSHED OUT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LOCAL COMMIT COMMUNITIES. AND AT ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE'VE HAD PREVIOUS YEARS THE NUMBERS GIGANTIC IS THE FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION JUST WHAT THE WORK DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET DONE NOW OR IS THIS. THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT. WE'VE GOT THOSE. EMPTY FIVE GALLON WATER BUCKETS THAT'S COLLECTING THE WATER FROM THE RAIN AND WE REALLY THERE'S WE CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE TO PUT THE THE ROOF ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS TO TACKLE AT FIRST WAS FRANKLY. JUST KIND OF GET A BETTER ASSESSMENT AND PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OUT THERE -- WE'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC AND SPOKEN WITH YOU IN THE PST THAT WE HAVE OVER A ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM -- WATER STANDS ACQUITTED WATER SYSTEMS ROOFS -- YOU KNOW ROADS BRIDGES ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU THINK OF FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR PARKS. ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST ALSO IS JUST A LITTLE MORE -- COMPLICATED IN THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE OFTEN IN SOME OF THE MOST REMOTE AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN VERY NATURALLY -- CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AREAS MAYBE ALONG THE COAST SO IT REQUIRES US TO BE REALLY EXTRA EXTRA THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL ON THE FRONT END OF THE PLANNING SO -- I WOULD HIGHLY THAT THREE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU FOLKS -- WELL THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A TOTAL OF EIGHTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING AND THAT WOULD BE OF AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO TACKLE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THAT BUILDS UPON ROUGHLY EIGHTY MILLION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED US OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THOSE PROJECTS ARE STILL VERY MUCH WORKING TO THE PIPELINES -- OVER THE LAST YEAR'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED US ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS AND THEN WE HAVE PROVIDED YOU A LIST OF PRIORITIZE PROJECTS THAT VERY TRANSPARENT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THOSE FUNDS. ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE PARK SYSTEM AND IT'S OUR INTENTION TO PROVIDE A SIMILAR LIST YOU AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT WILL BE PROVIDING THAT TO YOU SOON YEAH BECAUSE PROP. SIXTY EIGHT THE MAGIC NUMBER IS. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SO WE'RE WERE. THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AT BEST WE WERE GOING TO GET 20% OF THE WORK DONE AT THE BASS IF WE DID IT. ORIGINALLY ALTOGETHER PERHAPS I SHOULD THE ODDS -- IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW. WE ALSO HAVE A CAPACITY ISSUE TO BE ABLE TO PUSH OUT THAT MUCH MONEY ALL IN ONE YEAR SO WE ABSOLUTELY NEED THE FULL TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUT WE'RE JUST KIND OF STRATEGICALLY TRYING -- TO ONCE WE ACTUALLY GET THE APPROPRIATION WE HAVE A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH TO ACTUALLY ENCUMBER THE FUNDS. SO WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT IS ON THE OTHER WAY THAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT YOU HELPED US TACKLE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AS THAT LAST YEAR -- YOU APPROVED A PACKAGE OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE NEW POSITIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT -- ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED OF THOSE POSITIONS WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO FIXING OUR PARKS AND MAINTENANCE SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIRING PROCESS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE POSITION SO. WE'RE KIND OF TACKLING IT -- TWO WAYS RIGHT NOT JUST THESE ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG BUT ALSO BUILDING UP OUR MAINTENANCE CAPACITY. TO AT A MINIMUM SLOW THE GROWTH OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND JUST REALLY YOU KNOW -- GET ON TOP OF TACKLING THE LAST AND WE'VE PROVIDED YOU WOULDN'T IT EXCELLENT SEASON OF WEATHER SO THAT YOU COULD YOU KNOW THE TREES THAT WERE THE LIMBS THAT CAME DOWN THE THE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY REMOVAL AND MAINTENANCE WORK WHICH IS. INCREASE THE LA -- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT. AS COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS OUR OFFICE HAS AN I TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ON THE THE LARGER PROP SIXTY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS THAT YOU HEARD. AB PREVIOUSLY I'LL JUST. REMIND YOU OF THOSE COMMENTS AND IF IT SPECIFICALLY FOR PARKS AND SO FOR THESE PROPOSALS WE FOUND IS THAT JUST OVERALL THE SOME OF THE DETAIL WAS A LITTLE BIT LACKEY AND ADD THAT WE YOU KNOW WE THINK THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE. YOU REALLY HAVE SUFFICIENT DETAIL ON THESE PROPOSALS IN THAT IT MATCHES WITH YOUR PRIORITIES. AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN -- RESPONSIVE IN PROVIDING US ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE PROPOSALS AS WE'VE ASKED. AND THE FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR PARKS THERE'S TWO AREAS WHERE WE THINK THEY'RE STILL MORE INFORMATION ON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION ON THESE -- AND ONE IS RELATED TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND AS WAS DISCUSSED BY THE DIRECTOR READY AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED AND YOUR YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED A PRIORITIZED LIST -- THE LIST THAT WAS GIVEN IS YOU KNOW MANY MANY PAGES LONG AND ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROJECTS AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS IN THERE ALPHABETICAL ORDER. I'M AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ON THAT LIST THAT ARE MAYBE NOT THINGS YOU EVEN TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS BEING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A SENSE AND THAT -- PARK STAFF HAS PROVIDED SOME CATEGORIES OF HOW THEY'RE GONNA AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS BUT REALLY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SIZE OF THEIR BACKLOG IT'S REALLY. YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SPEND THESE FUNDS ON WITHOUT GETTING A PRIORITIZED LIST AND SO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT. AND THE AND THEN WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROP SIXTY EIGHT PROPOSALS AND JUST CALLING ATTENTION AS YOUR STAFF AGENDA DOES -- AS WELL TO THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR REVENUE ENHANCEMENT AND REVENUE. GENERATION OF PROGRAMS AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDED FOR PARKS THESE ARE NEW PROGRAMS AND AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT I I AM PROPOSAL WAS MADE BASICALLY A SPREADSHEET THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT OF DETAIL. WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL FROM PARKS AND AND WE WE WE'VE GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION BUT IT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOND ACT IN SO. YOU MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW THE FANS ARE GOING TO BE ALLOCATED HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE STRUCTURED -- WHY THIS SPECIFIC FUNDING AMOUNTS ON IN THIS YEAR I'M FOR THE REVENUE GENERATION AND PROPOSALS PARKS HAS INDICATED TO S. I'M SOME EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF PROJECTS AND LAKES NEW AND? CAMPGROUNDS AM OR OTHER PROJECTS TO INCREASE REVENUES BANG FOR YOU TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHO EXACTLY YOU KNOW HOW THESE FUNDS TO BE SPENT HOW THESE NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE STRUCTURED. SINCE HE'S A REALLY NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE I THINK THE LAST ONE IT -- TO THE VARIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS NOT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT I AND I REALIZE IT'S PARK. HELP US OUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE WERE JUST HAD A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE IN CLAMOR PREPAREDNESS AND HABITAT RESILIENCY. AND THEN WE GOT MONEY FOR YOU KNOW. INVESTMENTS AN ENVIRONMENTAL INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WE GOT TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YES SOMETIMES. I SEE A LINK BETWEEN THEM BECAUSE YOU WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS YOU SAY BECAUSE OF THE CLAIM MEANS. CHANGING CLIMATE THIS MAY BE. ENDANGERED AREA AND WE MADE RATHER THAN REPEAT FIX AD REPAIR WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. MOVING IT. UP WATER ARE UP UP UP THE APPEAL IN A NEW ONE IN THE AGAIN THAT'S MORE MONEY BUT AT LEAST THAT ANALYSIS IS COME IN THE SAY. WE'RE GONNA BAND IN REPAIRING THE ROOF HERE OR OR MAYBE EVEN ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE -- TO DO IT -- AS WE TRY. TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK WITH THE MONEY LET'S GO BACK TO THE REVENUE ENHANCEMENT THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION I MADE A NOTE ABOUT THAT BUT I DIDN'T FLIP MY PAGE -- DIRECTOR DID YOU HAVE ANY. DETAILS TO SHINE ON THAT PROGRAM THAT GRANT PROGRAM. I'LL DO THAT MY NAME IS CENTERED MITCHELL I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- THE REVENUE HAS A PROGRAM -- IS A PER CAPITA TYPE PROGRAM AND IT IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE PER CAPITA PROGRAM THAT WAS ALLOCATED LAST YEAR THE BOOK -- THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE DOLLARS -- AND THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY SEVEN MILLION THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR FOR THE ROLE PORTION OF THAT PER CAPITA -- WEIRD. COMBINING OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE UNIVERSE OF WHO WAS PASSED IN THIS CASE WHO HAS PASSED THE TAX REVENUE ENHANCEMENT MEASURE THAT. IS SPECIFIC TO OR PARK ENHANCEMENT I IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO SURVEY THE ENTIRE STATE WE NEED TO SURVEY ALL OF THE POTENTIAL -- COUNTIES CITIES -- JURISDICTIONS THAT DID THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT -- AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE SENT OUT A SURVEY TO ALL THE POTENTIAL -- AGENCIES ARE PROVIDING RECREATIONAL SERVICES OR THAT MAY HAVE DONE THAT ONCE WE GET THOSE BACK WHICH WE'RE EXPECTING THOSE TO BE RETURNED TO US BY JUNE. OF THIS YEAR -- WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE THE UNIVERSITY IS OF HOW THAT WILL BE SPENT OUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT INFORMATION JUST ON THE NATURAL. I MEAN YOU HAVE BEEN WE ASK EVERY LOCAL PARK. ADMINISTRATOR WHAT THE WHAT MONEY THEY NEED YEAH THAT'LL BE A BIG LESSON THAT WILL BE A LOT OF HEARINGS BUT IN. INPUT BUT YOU KNOW SOME WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PARK FACILITIES THAT ARE IN NATURAL WATERSHEDS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. IN IN IN OR PRIOR REDUCE AND THEY HAVE ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC. ALL THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE DISADVANTAGE PUBLIC AT SCHOOL WHEN WE GET THE EXTRA BANG FOR THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BECAUSE WE IMPROVE THAT WATERSHED WE GET MORE. RETENTION OF WATER WE WE REDUCE THE FIRED FIRED LEVEL IN VERSE IS A STANDALONE PARK. THAT IN MICE DISTRICT LET'S PICK ON ME AND MY DISTRICT IT'S NICE PART PEOPLE WANT TO DO IT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY IN THE CLIMB IT. I ARENA THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NATURAL WATERSHED -- AREA I DON'T ARE YOU ABLE TO JUST MAKE THAT. THIS IS ONLY THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT MUCH. I WORRIED ABOUT IF IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY WELL EXCEPT THAT THEIR OF THEIR ABOUT THE THOUSAND RECREATION PROVIDERS IN THE STATE -- RANGING FROM SMALL DISTRICTS TO CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE OF IT BECAUSE ONCE WE MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS. AND AND THOSE ALLOCATIONS ARE ARE PUT OUT THERE. THERE'S NO SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE WE MISS SOMEONE SO WE DO HAVE TO SURVEY EVERYONE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T. ARE THEY HAVE OR HAVE NOT QUALIFIED BY PASSING A REVENUE ENHANCEMENT MEASURE. EQUALLY I GUESS I'M MISSING IT WE HAVE WE HAVE REVERSING CREEK RESTORATION I KNOW MY MY CITY. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL TEN YEARS AGO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS READING SOMETHING I WAS ON THE COUNCIL I SAID TO THE PART PEOPLE I WANT YOU TO APPLY FOR THAT? THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO COME I MEAN THERE WAS A WEBSITE AND HAD SOMETHING THERE BUT BUT IF YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND HOLD EVERYBODY'S HAND THAT'S SUCKING UP A LOT OF MONEY. IT DOESN'T GO INTO. THE FIX IT OR OR OR THE PARK RIGHT. MISTER CHAIR MAYBE I CAN KIND OF HELP -- ECHO -- DEPUTY DIRECTORS MITCHELL SENTIMENTS -- YOU KNOW. WE REALLY ARE KIND OF APPROACHING THIS FROM A LESSONS LEARNED EFFORT FROM THE PAST THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST -- PART OF IN A BOND FUNDS TO GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. WE TREAT THESE FUNDS VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO ST GENERAL FUND TEEN AND WE DON'T VIEW THESE FUNDS WE WE LOOK AND TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE LANGUAGE THAT'S UNDER SB. FIVE AND THE INTENTION BEHIND US -- AND THAT THIS PART OF MONEY WASN'T NECESSARILY SET ASIDE FOR US TO DETERMINE WITHIN A YOU KNOW SACRAMENTO IN OUR ORGANIZATION. ON HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS -- WE ALSO WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WE WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF ALL OF THE NEEDS WE ABSOLUTELY JUST WITHIN CENTER CAN I COULD PROBABLY EASILY SPEND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION AND THINKING ABOUT SOME PLACES THAT WE KNOW OF BUT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT WERE ALSO IS A STATE TRYING TO OVERCOME IS REACHING ALL COMMUNITIES SOME COMMUNITIES ARE JUST A BETTER POSITIONED TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A REAL. DISCUSSION TOPIC AND DEVELOPING SB -- FIVE AND PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW FUNDS HAD BEEN ISSUED IN THE PAST HOW DO WE REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MAYBE NEED A LITTLE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. OR THE MINIMUM NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WE LIVE ON IT BREEDS AND EAT THIS EVERY DAY SO WE FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS BUT IN FACT. THEY DON'T AND SO MISTER MITCHELL COULD PROBABLY TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT MY IT'S IMPORTANT. DEFINITELY -- THE THE MEASURE ALSO CALLS FOR PARK ADVANCEMENT -- REVENUE -- ENHANCED WITH MEASURES -- SOME CITIES AND COMMUNITIES -- PAST GENERAL -- INFRASTRUCTURAL MEASURES THAT. MADE TOUCH ON PARKS BUT ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO PARKS WE WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ALL OF THOSE AREN'T AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE WE'RE FOR A FULFILLING SPIRIT OF WHAT THE LAW SAYS IT NEEDS TO FULFILL. AND SOME OF THESE MAY BE SMALL DISTRICTS THAT THERE THAT ARE -- AGAIN. I THE CITY MAY PASS A A A A SMALL TAX IN A COMMUNITY THAT IS A LONG -- FOR ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION THEY MAY BE LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE UNIVERSE OF THAT'S OUT THERE JUST IT IS A UNIVERSE WHERE THE PER CAPITA PROGRAM IN GENERAL -- INVOLVES -- THOUSANDS NOT JUST A FEW HUNDRED OR JUST AS COUNTIES IT ONCE WE START GETTING THE UNIVERSE FROM -- THE SECRETARY STATE ON WHO IS POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE AND THEN NEED TO EVALUATE -- THE DETERMINE IF THEY ACTUALLY ARE THE NUMBERS INCREASE INTO THE THOUSANDS NOT NOT IF THE UNIVERSE IS A THOUSAND PARK DISTRICTS ARE PARK THING. RIGHT EVERYBODY A THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECK IN. THE THIRTY MILLION THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IS GONE I MEAN IT'S IT'S IF WE WANNA JUST HELP THE KNOWLEDGEABLE NONE A KNOWLEDGEABLE YOU CAN JUST. IT'S IT WORKS OUT THE MAP THIS THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND BUCKS HERE YOU GO HERE YOU GO SAN FRANCISCO FANCIES FANCY PARK DISTRICT IN HERE YOU GO. FREMONT NOTHING PARK DISTRICT AND EVERYBODY GETS MY ACT I GUESS I MEAN WE MAY BE LEVER LEVERAGE IT BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT. HOW MUCH CAN YOU IMPROVE THE PARK WITH THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SOMETHING YOU KNOW SOME WILL GET DONE? I WISH I HAD MORE MONEY FOR YOU IS WHAT SORT OF WHAT MY POINT IS IS THAT AT THIS LOW LEVEL AND IT'S A PER CAPITA. RIGHT TO CHECK JUST GIVE IT TO THEM BUT I'VE MADE MY POINT SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PATRICK AMEND TRACTOR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- AND I WILL NOT GOING -- TO PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS THAT THE DIRECTOR AND I HAVE HAD ON ALL SHE'S A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT I THINK THAT LOOK THAT. THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS ONE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ECHO WHERE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS IS BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT THAT PRIORITY LIST LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOUR STRATEGY. IN. HOW YOU DECIDE UPON THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT -- AND I WOULD ASSUME IT'S GOING TO BE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC -- AND DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE ON WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT LIST. I'M I FEEL LIKE IT'S RATHER EMINENT I THINK IT'S UNDER REVIEW WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION SO I WOULD I'M HOPING THAT BEFORE THE NEXT HEARING. AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE HAVE EVERY OTHER YEAR SO IT'S WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU GET AN ASSESSMENT. OF HOW DUTY PRIORITIZE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR METHODOLOGY BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE OF SIMILAR PRIVATIZATION METHODOLOGY AS YOU'VE SEEN IN OUR LIST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS I WOULD LOVE TO BE A SIT DOWN PRIOR TO THE HEARING JUST APPEAR TO GO AND BE. HAPPY TO GREAT I THINK THE OTHER PIECES AND I UNDERSTAND -- MR DIFFERENT DOUBLE CHECK TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REGARDS OF THIRTY SEVEN MILLION THE ONE CONCERN THAT I WILL THROW OUT -- IN NO IT'S A BIT OF A BROKEN RECORD. IT'S WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT BERMAN COMMUNITIES. ANY LOOK AT RURAL COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE NOT PASSING PARK RANGERS. AND WHAT I WORRY ABOUT. IS THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE INCENTIVIZED. TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE PASSED PARK RANGERS. BUT WHERE WE NEED TO HELP THE MOST ARE MORE. RURAL AND URBAN WHO CANDIDLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SO THAT'S WHY I REMAIN CONCERNED ON THIS ONE AREA AND JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE A RESPONSE. CERTAINLY WORK. THIS PARTICULAR REVENUE ENHANCER ONE SORT OF REWARD FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE ART FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DID IN FACT. UNDERSTAND EXTEND THEMSELVES THERE'S ALSO ROLL COMPONENTS IN THERE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR OVERALL -- GUIDELINES THE STATE TO STATE WY PART PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE -- WE DESIGNED AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT -- THERE'S A NATURAL ORGANIC PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE WHERE -- RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN COMPETE. S. ON PAR WITH THE URBAN COMMUNITIES WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IS LOOK BACK AT OUR PROPERTY FOR UNDERSTAND WHY PARK PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE AND YOU'LL SEE THE SPREAD OF DOLLARS WERE BOTH AND URBAN LOS ANGELES. AND IN SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THE IN THE IN THIS -- THE DISTRIBUTION OF THAT THE I. NINETY AMOUNTS OF THOSE TO COMPETE -- REALLY HAS -- HAS -- SHOWN THAT THE PROCESS WE USE -- WORKS -- IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE GUIDELINES WE HAVE HAD -- SINCE SEPTEMBER WE HAD OVER -- FOUR HUNDRED FOLKS ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS WE HAD -- A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS AND OPEN SESSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN COMMA NAY THAT WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN WORKSHOPS THAT WE TOOK A FINISHED AND ON MARCH FIRST -- THAT WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED CAME TO THOSE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WITH IT I ON MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO COMPETE AND PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD ALONG WITH THE OTHER PIECES OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WE PROVIDE -- I THINK I BELIEVE ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN NEEDING TO BE -- TO HAVE THE DOLLARS ARE THE MEASURE THAT IS ALREADY PASSED OR ALLOCATED CORRECT ONLY FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM ONLY THE REVENUE ENHANCEMENT THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY TO AND FORTY NINE MILLION THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY -- WORKING WITH A AUGUST FIFTH DEADLINE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO COMPETE EQUALLY IN THAT PROCESS AND WE'VE WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEM AND THEN. IN IN WHAT WAS JUST FOCUS IN THREE SEVEN MILLION THE REASON BEING IS THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK THAT WHERE STATE PARKS WANTS TO BE ABLE TO GO. AND WHERE IS BAYLOR BRING IN. IN PARTICULAR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I A N. INSURING THAT -- OUR PARKS ARE GONNA BE OPEN FOR ALL. I THINK WITH THE CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS IS THAT THEY'RE UNDER PARKED. UNDER PARK BECAUSE A LACK OF RESOURCES. HI END SAME THING IN RURAL. AND I GET IT IN REGARDS TO THIRTY SEVEN MILLION YOU DO NOT SAY THIS IS FOR MY WORDS. THAT IT'S A SMALLER ALLOCATION COMPARED TO THE BIGGER POT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT ESPECIALLY IN ROLE IN IN -- IN URBAN COMMUNITIES NOT ALL. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE -- THE DOLLARS ON THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE AND THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN WITHIN PER CAPITA THERE ALSO BE AN ALLOCATION -- FOR THE COUNTIES THAT OR HAVE FIVE OR IN THOUSAND OR MORE IN. BUT BUT POPULATIONS UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THOSE SMALLER CITIES WE'LL GET A AN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THAT'S WHERE THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. TO OF FOR IT FOR THE PER CAPITA ROGRAM THEY WERE ASKING FOR THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER TEMPERATURE NAY INVENTOR NAY SAID TO ITS IMMINENT ARE YOU THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT. YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A CIRCLE BACK WITH FOLKS BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF YOU HAD IT BEFORE THE NEXT HEARING BUT WILL IF THAT. IF THAT IF THAT CHANGES THEN WE'LL CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU AHEAD OF TIME [inaudible] SENATE. THERE'S CHAIR ARM THANK YOU MANDRAKE TURN DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO I GUESS -- ALL JUMP OFF WHERE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE NORTH LEFT -- LESS SO ON THE READ IN REVENUE ENHANCER MEASURES MORE ON THIS OR TO ACCESS PIECE. SIMILAR QUESTION THAT I ASKED W. C. B. I DID SEE. A NOTE THAT THE RELEASE OF A DRAFT APPLICATION GUIDE IS ON HOLD AROUND COMMUNITY ACCESS. FUNDS IN THAT. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC WOOD WAS NOTIFIED THAT. THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT SECTION THAT -- WE'VE PASSED VOTED ON IN THE VOTERS VOTED ON CAN'T BE USED FOR PROOF TO FUND PROGRAMS ACTIVITIES AND TRANSPORTATION. BUT THEN I GO BACK. TO THE LEGISLATION ACTUALLY CAST A VOTE ON IN. IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYS COMMUNITY ACCESS PROJECTS AND NOT NESTED IN SOME OTHER PROJECT BUT SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITY ACCESS PROJECTS. IN THAT INCLUDE UNLIMITED TO TRANSPORTATION AND ONE THAT TO ME ONE OF THE BIG GAPS. IT'S NOT JUST ON THE CAPITAL SIDE IN LAND ACQUISITION AND THOSE THINGS BUT TO GET A RURAL COMMUNITY GET SOMEONE LOW INCOME. TO INCREDIBLE RESOURCE WE HAVE. TO GET THERE IT'S HARD AND IT AND MAYES BE SOMEWHAT ABOUT GETTING A LOW COST ACCOMMODATION BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUST HAVING. SOME SERVICE PATHWAY A PROGRAM IS IT ABOUT YOU KNOW CAN KIDS GO TO CAMP THERE ARE THERE WAYS TO INTEGRATE COMMUNITIES SO YOU DON'T JUST SORT OF PLOP THEM. AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PARK ALONE AND EXPECT THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY THERE BUT THAT THAT I GUESS THAT WAS THE PROMISE I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE. AND I RECOGNIZE ME WE HAVE DEAL WITH YOUR SAID LOVE TO GET YOUR ALL FEEDBACK AS WELL BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR CAN YOU GUYS SHED SOME MORE LIGHT ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THINKING THERE EITHER FOR THAT WE CAN START D. O. F. EVEN IF YOU WANT. GOOD MORNING -- MICHAEL MCGINNIS WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO THE LANGUAGE SURROUNDING THE COMMUNITY ACCESS PIECE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT CONTAIN SOME -- LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE -- THAT FUNDING TO BE SPENT IN IS CONSISTENT WITH G. OF ONLINE PER THE AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. SO WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH OUR IN HOUSE COUNSEL TO DETERMINE HOW EXACTLY THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. OUR GOAL IS TO COME UP WITH A FIRM DIRECTION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO ALL DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE -- ALLOCATIONS FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND HAVE MORE A UNIFIED ROLL OUT ON HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. I WOULD JUST SAY I MEAN I I KNOW THE LANGUAGE YOU'RE YOU'RE REFERRING TO HERE WHICH IS. NOT TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE STATE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND LAW RIGHT SO AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF DEAL WITH. IT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH. OF THESE BOND DOLLARS CAN GO TO SORT OF DOLLARS ASSOCIATED SAY WITH CAPITAL PROJECTS BUT THAT ARE NOT. LIKE ON THEIR VERY OWN JUST CAPITAL PROJECTS. I WOULD JUST SAY -- OUR INTENT IS A LEGISLATURE I FEEL LIKE IT'S PRETTY EXPLICIT -- SO I'M JUST HOPING IN THROUGH THAT PROCESS YOU GUYS CAN TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT TRY TO FIND A PATH I MEAN I I I THINK THAT'S REALLY. THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW THAT WE'RE BRINGING YOU IS YEAH WE WE'VE GOT OF THE CULTURE HERE AND WE DON'T AND WE DON'T WANT TO VIOLATE THE BASIC GOOD GOVERNANCE GENERAL BOND PRINCIPLES BUT WITH THE THRESHOLD IT'S BEEN THAT BASED ON PRESIDENT -- AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM OUR COUNCIL ANY RISK THAT'S WHY WE WE PASS THIS IS WAY SO WE'RE HOPING YOU GUYS CAN GET CREATIVE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE OTHERWISE. IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT THAT SORT OF DEEPER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EQUITY PROMISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO DIRECTOR JEFF COMMISSURE -- SENATOR STERN -- BUT BEYOND JUST KIND OF THIS THIS SPECIFIC PART OF MONEY I WOULD SAY -- THAT THERE'S BEEN THIS REAL RECOGNITION -- THAT THE KEY ROLE THAT TRANSPORTATION PLAYS IN IS VERY OR FAX US I THINK THE STATE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS IT IN VARIOUS AREAS -- I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF HAD FUNDING AND GRANTS PROGRAMS I THINK IN THE IN THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY SAID THERE'S BEEN KIND OF AN EXPRESSION AND UNDERSTANDING -- THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WE HAVE BEEN -- WE HAVE SOME PILOT PROJECTS AND SOME OF OUR PARKS WE ARE WE HAVE A PORTS PROGRAM AND IT'S A IT'S A IN REAL TIME USING VIDEO CONFERENCING TO REACH K. THROUGH TWELVE CHILDREN. AND WE'VE ACTUALLY IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY ROBUST PROGRAM THAT WE'VE HAD FOR PROBABLY NINE OR TEN YEARS BUT WHAT ALWAYS DISAPPOINTEDUS WHEN WE I THINK COLLECTIVELY WE NEVER FELT GOOD ABOUT. IS IT ALLOWS FOR A LIVE INTERACTION YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INTERPRETER THERE IN A TIDAL POOL TALKING ABOUT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ROLE THAT STARFISH PLAY BUT THEN IT DOESN'T GET THE CHILD ACTUALLY OUT INTO THE PARK IN THE OUTDOORS. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO ACTUALLY THEN GIVE A PARK PASS -- BUT EVEN IF YOU GIVE A PASS TO COME TO THE PARK TRANSPORTATION ALSO BECOMES A BARRIER -- WE'VE TRIED TO WORK WITH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS EDUCATION TO SEE IF YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN KIND OF PARTNER -- BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- PARTNERS -- ACROSS THE STATE'S OUR OWN PARTNERS -- OFTENTIMES FRANKLY I USE SENATOR MAGUIRE'S -- DISTRICT -- THE CINEMA AREA AS A PRIME EXAMPLE. THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THAT GOES ALONG THE CALIFORNIA SIGN IN THAT AREA AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF THAT COMMUNITY THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN. THE OCEAN WE WERE -- DOWN IN THE COMMUNITY EVAN TURNER AND YOU GO ONE MILE UP THE STREETS AND OUR INTERPRETERS HAVE CONNECTED WITH -- KIDS IN IN ADULTS THAT HAVE NEVER GONE TO THE OCEAN SO NOT EVERYONE HAS SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY OR IN THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY THAT THEY GREW UP WITH THAT KIND OF INTRODUCE THEM TO THESE PLACES SO -- SO WE ACTUALLY WE GRANTED A WE HAD -- SOME FUNDS THAT YOU PROVIDED US LAST YEAR -- TO DO SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE DONE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT WE ALSO ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NEW NONPROFIT THAT WAS SET UP THROUGH SENATE BILL. ELEVEN ELEVEN AND IT'S CALLED PARKS CALIFORNIA. SB ELEVEN ELEVEN ALLOWED OUR ORGANIZATION THE DEPARTMENT TO GOING TO A VERY UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH A NON PROFIT -- IN BY UNIQUE IT MEANS THAT -- THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND RECREATION ACTS ARE EX OFFICIO MEMBERS ON THAT BOARD -- WE ALSO COLLABORATE AND DETERMINE -- A PRIORITIZATION SETTING AND MUCH OF WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON IS ON THIS VERY ISSUE AN ACCESS -- THE FIRST PROJECT OUT OF THE GATE THAT THEY'RE FOCUSING IN ON AS TRANSPORTATION I JUST DID A CALL WITH THEM YESTERDAY THINKING ABOUT -- HOW TO GO ABOUT THAT -- WE ALSO EXPECT THEM TO DO -- CAPITAL -- FUNDRAISING. AS WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY THEY LITERALLY OUR STAFFING UP THEY HAVE -- ONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND SO SHE'S OUT RECRUITING -- BUT TRANSPORTATION IS GOING TO BE A REALLY KEY FOCUS ALSO IN THE PARKS AND REC COMMISSION MEETINGS WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN KIND OF PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. ANOTHER -- WHEN I WAS ON THE CALL YESTERDAY I HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE FRIENDS OF SANTA CRUZ HAVE A REALLY INNOVATIVE PROGRAM -- AND OUT THERE WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE USED SOME OF THEIR FUNDING AND SOMETIMES SOME OF OUR STAFF TO ACTUALLY REACH A LOT OF THESE K. THROUGH TWELVE COMMUNITIES -- SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS GETTING A LOT OF AND A SERVICE WE'RE HOPEFUL ABOUT THE BOND MEASURE BUT I WILL TELL YOU -- WHEN WE DID THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT MATT -- SESSIONS WE WERE WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS KIND OF YET AND DETERMINATION TO BE MADE SO WE MADE IT CLEAR WITH THE PUBLIC THAT THAT WAS STILL PENDING BUT IT ALSO GAVE US A SENSE TO STILL IDENTIFY THE NEEDS OUT THERE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS IS NOT THE PARK BOND MONEY IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE WOULD WITH THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO RESOURCES AND WE NEED TO GET A BETTER HANDLE. ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SHARE IS THAT I THINK YOU HEARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TALKING ABOUT THERE'S GOING TO THESE REAL TIME CONVERSATIONS GOING ON IN THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON IS OKAY WELL IF IT CAN'T FIND PROGRAMS. WHAT CAN IT FUND SO FOR HALF PERHAPS COULD YOU USE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS TO PURCHASE A BUSES? SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAN I JUST WANT YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE BEING REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE WORK AND BEST SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- IN BE CONSISTENT WITH BOND FINANCING LAW BUT THEN ALSO -- THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE END ALL BE ALL THAT IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT PARKS BEING FOR ALL THAT TRANSPORTATION IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT AS A STATE WE AFTER ADDRESS WE SHOULDN'T GIVE UP ON THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INSIGHT AND EIGHT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE CREATIVITY AND COBBLING -- YOU KNOW LEVERAGING PRIVATE NONPROFIT DOLLARS LOOKING AT THE COSTA CONSERVANCY SIDE OF THINGS TRY TO PUT A PACKAGE TOGETHER HERE THAT'S GOING TO BE BOTH. THIS PROP SIXTY EIGHT WHAT'S NOT TO FORCE TODAY WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WHETHER TTC GRANTS ARE LOOKING AT ELP HAVE FOR THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER WAYS TO GET CREATIVE -- AND I I JUST I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE. THAT OPEN MINDED THINKING AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH WHEN WE SAY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM EXPLICITLY. YOU KNOW WEN PEOPLE ARE VOTING ON THIS AND YOU KNOW WE GO ROUND SAY IT WE'VE BEEN DOING A PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WHERE WE'VE BEEN BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS FROM ALL OVER LA HAVE BEEN HELPING KIDS GET TO THE BEACH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AND IT IS SOMETHING TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN LIVING? TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES AWAY -- AND THE WALL THAT EXISTS FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEN A LOOK ON A KID'S FACE IT'S LIKE THE THE THIS IS WHAT SURFING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING EL TIME JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW. I GREW UP IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD OR LIKE  COME FROM THIS BACKGROUND I CAN DO THIS TOO I DON'T I THINK IT'S TRANSCEND AND TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SO WE WANT TO HELP YOU. PARTNER WITH YOU GUYS ON THAT -- AND I I THINK THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE -- LAST THING I JUST ASK -- ON THIS SAID DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUE. OF MEN'S AS YOU'RE WORKING ON YOUR PROJECT LIST PARTY'S ASIAN. ARE YOU THINKING I MEAN I I HAVE TO SHOUT OUT ARE YOUR AMAZING REGIONAL DIRECTOR CRAIG SAT DOWN IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE THAT LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH. DOWN THERE I KNOW THIS IS TRUE ON THE STATE BUT THOSE FIRES TORE THROUGH A LOT A LOT OF SACRED. REALLY SPECIAL PLACES THAT THE COMMUNITY THRIVES IN OUR SORT OF THE BACKLOG OF GETTING RESERVATIONS IS LIKE STALLED OUT. FOR FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS FURTHER BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL. HURTIN SO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT AT ALL IN TERMS YOU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TREASURES IS THAT. NOT THE THE RIGHT BUCKET NECESSARILY I THINK THE IT'S PROBABLY JUST NOT THE RIGHT BUCKETS SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE FEMALE EFFORT WITH CALLAWAY YES -- AND YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE SUFFERED -- SEVERAL FIRES ITEM IT WAS A HISTORIC FIRE YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE HAD THE CAR FIRE IN READING -- WE HAD THE CAMPFIRE THE CAMPFIRE THE IN THE PORT ROLE THAT STATE PARKS PLAY DOES REALLY LAST WE HAD LAST -- DAMAGE THEIR TORE LAKE ORVILLE -- STATE RECREATION AREA BUT WE ARE SERVING MORE -- AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TERMS OF HOUSING -- DISPLACED INDIVIDUAL SO WE HAVE ONE OF OUR CAMP LIPS THAT WERE UNDER CONTRACT WITH FEMA. AND THEY'RE PUTTING IN FEMA TRAILERS -- TO HOUSE DISPLACED INDIVIDUALS WE ALSO -- RE INTO A AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY -- TO THERE WAS ANOTHER WAVE OF DISPLACED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING HOUSE THERE WE FOUND THAT DURING THE FIRES FRANKLY WE NOW THE FIRST THING WE DO IS WE LOOK AT WHAT PARKS EVEN IF A PARK IS ON A PER IN A BURNT POTENTIAL BERNIE AREA. BUT THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE TEND TO RUN TO THE PARK -- FOR THE FIRST PLACE OF SHELTER AND RESPITE SO WE PLAYED A PART IN ROLE IN THAT. IN TERMS OF THE WILL THE FIRE WE HAD MORE -- DISPLACED PARK -- STAFF LIKE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES HOUSING -- BUT WE HAD MORE PARK DAMAGE AND SO AS YOU KNOW -- BUT WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW MUD SLIDES AND WATER SAID SOME THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO THINK THROUGH. THE WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CALLAWAY -- SO -- I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THOSE THINGS IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET BUCKET -- YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE THINGS ON A HIGHER PRIORITY LESTER TRYING TO GET THOSE THINGS ARE STORED AND BACK OPEN ACCESSIBLE CENTER JONES. SENATOR STERN READ MY NOTES EARLIER SO THE QUESTION IS PRETTY MUCH DRIVING ASPECT I DO WANT TO JUST RAISE. ON THE ACCESS -- AND THE 5% AND I MET WITH A GREAT GROUP -- YOU YOUNG FOLKS -- FROM MY DISTRICT THAT ARE YOU KNOW ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO GET IN THE PARKS AND ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THEY RAISED IS THAT THEY CAN USE THE FUNDS TO BUY A VEHICLE BUT THEY CAN'T USE THE FUNDS TO PUT GAS IN THE VEHICLE. SO -- THEN YOU KNOW I'M NOT EVEN BE WORK SIR FAIRLY WELL AS CENTER STERN SOUNDS LIKE RECESS YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON I GUESS THE REMAINING QUESTION BE. YOUR YOUR WORK ON THIS OF THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE FIX. WE CAN PROVIDE -- THROUGH THAT YOU KNOW THE THE COMPLIES WITH THE BOND MAJOR THAN MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE HAD A LOOK AT I'M SENATOR I APPRECIATE THOSE -- THOSE COMMENTS IN THOSE THOUGHTS I THINK THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY IS MUCH BROADER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION IT APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE BONTA MEASURE AND ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING THE ALLOCATION SO -- I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT BUT I EXPECT THAT THIS WILL BE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION AS WE LEARN MORE. BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE FUNDS CAN BE USED. FOR WHAT THEY CAN'T BE IS FOR AND THEN WE NEED TO CHANNEL THAT BACK OUT TO POTENTIAL APPLICANTS AROUND THE STATE -- AN AD THAT -- YOUR THE ANALOGY THAT THE CAR CERTAINLY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IT'S THE THE GAS THAT STILL. THE ONGOING DISCUSSION. AND THEN THERE WAS MENTION THE FUEL OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE VEHICLE AND THEN ALSO. YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL PARKS -- AND MISSION TO GET IN AND THAT KIND OF THING WAS NOT AVAILABLE SO. OKAY THERE'S NO ACTUALLY NEED TO BE TAKEN OUR STAFF WILL BE TALKING WITH YOU ON THESE THIS MATTER LET'S MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER. SIXTEEN THIS IS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT STAFFING -- ONE POINT SEVEN FOUR MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS AND ONE POINT SIX THREE THREE MILLION ON GOING FOR TWELVE POSITIONS THANK YOU MISTER THIS IS FOR TWELVE POSITIONS THESE WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE -- POSITIONS TO HELP US -- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AS WE TRANSITION OVER TO THE STATE'S NEW STATEWIDE -- BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FISCALE WE INITIALLY -- STARTED TO TRANSITION IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I THINK SOME OF THE INITIAL WORK WHAT I THINK WE ALWAYS EXPECTED THAT WE THERE WOULD BE A ONE TIME SPIKE IN WORKLOAD. BUT AS WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FISCAL DEPARTMENT ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THAT WORKLOAD WAS GOING TO BE ON GOING IN NATURE. WE ARE -- A RATHER IT. ACCOUNTING WISE WE HAVE -- SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING WORKLOADS IF I CAN RUN DOWN A FEW THINGS IN SOME CASES WE HAD SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WE DID ANNUALLY THAT NOW WE'RE HAVING TO DO MONTHLY. SO ALL OF THIS IS IN THE SPIRIT OF HIGHER -- MEETING HIGHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ALSO MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT WE ALSO ADMINISTER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY APPROPRIATIONS FOR VARIOUS CONSERVANCY'S BALDWIN HILLS SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY. AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY -- MOUNTAINS -- WHEN WE FIRST WE FIRST TACKLE IT IS A ONE TIME ISSUE WE HIRE TEMPORARY STAFF -- WE ASKED OURADMINISTRATIVE STAFF TO DO OVERTIME -- THEY ROSE TO THE OCCASION WE PROBABLY DID A OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF OVERTIME -- ACCOUNTING AND BUDGETING OFFICES AND STATE AGENCIES TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SEASONAL OVERTIME BUT WE FOUND THAT THIS IS NOT SEASONAL. SO IN THAT CASE WE NEEDED TO LOOK FOR SOME ON GOING RESOURCES -- WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL INCREASE EFFICIENCY OVER TIME BUT IT WILL ALSO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY -- BUT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE FEELING PRETTY GOOD AN OPTIMA STICK ABOUT IT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MAKING SURE THAT WE GET SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY IN THE OFFICE OF FLAVOR OF THE EFFICIENCY INCREASE BECAUSE FISCAL THE PROMISE OF IT IS. IT'S GOING NOWHERE YOU'RE ASKING FOR ONE POINT. SIX FOREVER AND EVER JUST STAY TED TO HAVE. I'LL BUY INTO THE TRANSPARENCY BUT WE'RE WHEN DO WE REALIZE THE EFFICIENCY WHAT WHAT AND WHAT THAT MIGHT THAT LOOK LIKE IN THE PARKS AND RECREATION. DOMAIN. SURE UP THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MONIES WILL SHOPS ON THE DAVID DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION FOR STATE PARKS. SO I THINK THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO REALIZE OFFICE BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND CAL STARS IT IS MUCH MORE ROBUST IT PROVIDES. ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY THAT WAS NEVER THERE A CAL STARS AND IT MIMICS MUCH MORE MODERN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM THEN OUR LEGACY SYSTEM CAL STARS. SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED -- THROUGH FISCAL I THINK. THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF FISCAL WILL BE -- TRANSITION WAY FROM DONE WITH CAL STAR INTO MORE OF A AN AUTOMATED PAPER FLOW OR AUTOMATED WORKFLOW WITH FISCAL AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD JUST BE. PROCESSING INVOICES THROUGH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD TO SEND OVER. REAMS OF PAPER TO SCO THOSE WOULD BE AUTOMATED IN FUTURE -- I THINK AS THE STATE ACCLIMATE ITSELF MORE TO THE NEW SYSTEM -- BUSINESS PROCESSES -- EVOLVE. THOSE THINGS WILL BECOME MORE -- TO APPARENT -- TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT FOR NOW IT'S A LITTLE. WE'RE IN A TRANSITIONAL STATE SO THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN QUITE AS EFFICIENT AS THEY WILL BE ULTIMATELY WITH THIS GIRL I THINK ALSO WHAT I MIGHT ADD IN TERMS OF FISSION SAYING. IS THAT I THINK WHEN WHEN -- IN TERMS OF THE PROJECT IF IT'S A STATEWIDE PROJECT AND IT ALSO CHANGES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL AGENCIES SO THERE ARE OTHER EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE NOT NECESSARILY POSITION TO SPEAK. TO THAT ARE KIND OF OUTSIDE OF JUST THE DEPARTMENT. HELLO I HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THIS. WE WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS PROPOSAL AND LOOKING AT THE OVERTIME HOURS THAT AND THE ACCOUNTING STAFF HAS BEEN OCCURRING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD TO MEET THE HIGHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OF THE PROPOSAL. GENERALLY SEEM REASONABLE BUT GOOD OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LONG TERM NATURE OF WHEN WHEN THOSE EFFICIENCIES WILL ACTUALLY MANIFEST OKAY. I WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS WHEN I FINISH ALTHOUGH HOLD UP THE MATTERS MEMBERS WERE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN. AND WITH THAT A MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER STAFFING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. SEVENTEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE POSITIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LAST YEAR YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE CAME BEFORE YOU AND TALKED ABOUT -- A PROPOSAL WHICH THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR NEW CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CULTURAL CENTRE. THE INTENTION IS THAT IT WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT INDIAN MUSEUM WHICH IS CO LOCATE LOCATE CO LOCATED WITH OTHER SUPPORT HERE I SACRAMENTO -- BUT THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS ACQUIRED THE PROPERTY IN WEST SACRAMENTO THIS WAS A SITE THAT WAS SELECTED BY A TASK FORCE OF THAT FROM THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. THEY CHOSE THIS LOCATION BECAUSE IT WAS -- HAD CULTURAL -- AND SACRED SIGNIFICANCE TO THEM IT WAS AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE TWO RIVERS SO IT WAS THEIR FIRST PARTY SITE SELECTION SO SINCE WE WERE LAST BEFORE YOU -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO TO FINALIZE THAT SO WE EXPECT THAT LAND TRANSFER WAS SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL NOT. AND WE EXPECT THE LAND TRANSFER TO OCCUR SOMETIME OVER THE SUMMER SO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE -- ALSO THAT THE WE ALSO SHARED WITH YOU AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS THE STATE'S INTENTION TO WORK WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. TO SEE IF WE COULD SECURE SOME PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT SO THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION BECAME A NUMBER FOUR MARK MARTIN NORTH OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION -- SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED HERE ARE RESOURCES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR BUT OUR FIRST HOPE WAS TO BE ABLE TO GO AND SEE IF WE COULD WORK OUT SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH CITY OF A SACRAMENTO -- THAT DID NOT MATERIALIZE SO WE'RE HERE ASKING FOR THESE RESOURCES I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PATROL. I'D AT IT I DON'T THE THE MONEY FOR PATROLLING THE PROPERTY WE HAVEN'T EVEN BUILT. WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD HOW WHY WOULD WE NEED? A OPPOSITION OR OR MAINTAINING. ITS. SACRED LAND I'LL BUT I'LL GET THAT I GET THAT BUT IT'S BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS JUST BECAUSE THE PARK DISTRICT REQUIRES IT WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR PATROLLING. AND MAINTAINING WHATEVER THAT MAY BE I GET THE DEVELOPMENT I SEE THAT WE HAVE. THAT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTION THIS IS MONEY THAT GOES ON FOREVER AND EVER. THIS -- AT THIS LOCATION IS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF WEST SACRAMENTO IN NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S NOT A VERY REMOTE LOCATION -- SO KIND OF IN THE SPIRIT OF BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS THIS PARTICULAR PARCEL OF LAND IN THE PAST HAS HAD SOME ISSUES IN TERMS OF HAVING AN HOMELESS POPULATION THERE. SO THE CITY OF LOS SACRAMENTO HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO RESTORE THAT TO A PLACE WHERE LOCAL INDIVIDUALS CAN USE IT FOR HIKING AND FISHING. SO THEIR HOPE IS THAT WHEN IT TRANSFERS OVER TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS THAT IT IS STILL LEFT IN A MANNER THAT SAY FOR PEOPLE TO GO AND EXPERIENCE THAT -- AND TO FINISH AND TO WALK AND JUST ENJOY THAT'S THAT OPEN SPACE SO THAT WAS PART OF THE COMMITMENT OF THIS. WOULDN'T THAT BE PART OF YOU HAVE A CONSTRUCTION BUDGET THERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD SOMETHING IT'S NOT JUST. NOTHING THERE WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE'S GOING TO BE NORMAL FENCING I PRESUME AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW BEFORE WE START CONSTRUCTION. WELL WE'RE STARTING OUR OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS OR A KIND OF WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL COMMITTEE TO DESIGN THE COMMUNITY TO DESIGN WHAT EXACTLY THIS FACILITY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND SO EVEN THOUGH -- THE SHOVEL IS NOT HITTING DIRT AND CONSTRUCTION ISN'T HAPPENING JUST YET WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPERTY DOESN'T LOOK FORGOTTEN WE ALSO HAVE AN ADJACENT PROPERTY THAT'S PART OF THAT'S ALREADY STATE PARKS PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE A GARDENING. ON PROJECT WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THAT'S THE INTENTION AND SO WE WANTED TO RANT THAT -- PARTICULAR EFFORT UP AND I DON'T KNOW IF -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN DO HAS ANYTHING TO ADD OR MAYBE NOT. YEAH I WOULD JUST BRING TO A STATE PARKS AS AD THAT YOU KNOW BY ACQUIRING THIS PROPERTY WOULD COME OF POPULAR AND WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY. WHEN THIS WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD LAST DECEMBER? WE IDENTIFIED THE ONGOING COSTS OF MANAGING JUST THE PROPERTY LOAN. BECAUSE THE B. C. P. THAT WAS -- OR THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS THAT WAS FUNDED LAST YEAR THE OTHER MILLION -- FOR DEVELOPMENT WE IDENTIFIED THE ONGOING COST FOR THE FULL BUILD OUT OF OF THE OF THE CENTER RECOGNIZING THAT THE THE INITIAL COST WOULD BE A FRACTION A PORTION OF THAT. JUST JUST TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO BE A GOOD LANDOWNER. HOW A. L. HELP ME? I'M IT JUST COMPUTERS OF THE ANALYST'S OFFICE SUITE SO WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY ISSUES OF THIS PROPOSAL AND I WILL LET THE DEPARTMENT I'M. SPEAK TO AND JUSTIFY THEIR OWN PROPOSAL BUT JUST WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT DIDN'T REALLY RAISE CONCERNS FOR AS THERE HAVE BEEN EITHER AND PROJECTS WHERE THE STATE HAS ACQUIRED RIGHT OF WAY AND IS NOT STARTED CONSTRUCTION YET AND THE GAME MEET LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL I THINK WE'VE. DONE THIS I'M WORRIED HAD TO PAY FOR SECURITY COSTS SO ONCE THE STATE DOES OWN THE LAND IT DOES BECOME THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY AND SO IT'S NOT AND REASONABLE THAT. I'M WE WOULD HAVE SOME TIME COSTS TO TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY OR TO SECURE THE PROPERTY. AND THERE COULD BE HIGHER COSTS IN THE FUTURE IF THERE'S BLADE OR LITTERING OR OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THE PROPERTY IT POTENTIAL FOR FIRES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT. I AM YOU MIGHT WANT TO IT JUST YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT THE PROPERTY IS IS MAINTAINED AND BEING A BEING A GOOD NEIGHBOR IS THAT AS THEM. THE DIRECTOR HAS INDICATED SO WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY FACTS FOR US FOR THAT REASON DIDN'T SEEM INCONSISTENT WITH HOW WE HANDLED OTHER PROPERTIES WERE REQUIRED -- A PERSONAL OUR RIGHT OF WAY AND AND HAVING STARTED CONSTRUCTION. FULLY BUILT OUT. I'M WITH EVERYBODY YOU GOT TO MUSEUM YOU GOT THE PLAZA YOU GOT WHATEVER YOU GOT THERE YOU GOT SOME PATROL GUY GOING ON HE GOT WHATEVER MAINTENANCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WERE MADE IN THE MAINTAINING. IF WE'RE GOING. TO GET THE BULLDOZERS IN THERE ARE MAKE MUSEUM ON IT I MEAN I I DON'T NORMALLY. AT LEAST MY EXPERIENCE IN LIFE IS THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT IN IF I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PLAZA IS A GOOD TO BE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE. PUTTING THINGS IN AND HOW IT COULD BE LAID OUT AND WHAT'S THE SACRED SITES FROM THE NON SACRED SITES. JUST. LEAVE IT. BUT LET'S SEE FREE MY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE HIS BUDGET. LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING IS THERE ANYBODY HERE ON THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER STAFFING. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THE WOMAN. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE DIRECTOR. I'LL JUST SAY AS A PART TIME RESIDENT OF WEST SACRAMENTO. ALL RIGHT THE CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. I'VE EXPRESSED MY ANGST. SOME OF I AM. GOOD TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I CASKEY I JONES [inaudible] MCGUIRE. MONNING I STERN. ALL RIGHT THAT MADISON HAS FIVE VOTES TO PROVE. CALIFORNIA MUSEUM THIS IS A MILLION DOLLARS I'M GOING. TO SUPPORT THE MUSEUM'S MISSION AND ENGAGE AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. THE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION MERELY SERVES AS A PASS THROUGH WHERE THIS FUNDS ARE PREPARADA CENTER PASSED ON TO THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM. ON THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM IS LOCATED HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE INTENTION OF THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM WAS TO SHOWCASE. MUCH OF THE COLLECTIONS AND THE CONTENTS OF THE STATE ARCHIVES -- AND SHARING THAT WITH THE PUBLIC ON THE DEPARTMENT PARKS AND RECREATION WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE -- UNDER OUR STEWARDSHIP A WAREHOUSE FULL OF VARIOUS COLLECTIONS SO WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THEM TO SERVE AS A MEANS OF PUTTING OUR COLLECTIONS OUT FOR THE PUBLIC TO EXPERIENCE THEM. THIS PARTICULAR -- THE FUNDING REQUEST WOULD GO TO CELEBRATE THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE SERVER JUST MOVEMENTS AND THE INTENTION IS THAT IT WOULD FUND A CENTENNIAL EXHIBIT WHICH WOULD BE -- UNIT. THE FOR ABOUT A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND THAT THERE WOULD THEN BE AN ON GOING PERMANENT EXHIBIT SHOWCASING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT INCLUDE THE PROVISION THAT THAT EXHIBIT WOULD BE ABLE TO GO ON THE ROAD AND BE. SHARED WITH OTHER MUSEUMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ON THE THE CONTRIBUTION SETTLEMENT MADE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. MUSEUMS MAKE THEIR MONEY BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE EXHIBIT AND TAKING IT ON THE ROAD. IN A MISTER CHAIR I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW BUT THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM AND AND GET BACK TO IT BECAUSE THE EXPERTISE THAT WE HAVE AT THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM IS KNOWING WHERE ALL THE PIECES ARE LAID. PUTTING IT TOGETHER IN THE FANCY SPAN SHE WAY AND AND ALSO WITH THE VIDEO WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT TO DO AND THEN YOU SAY. SMITHSONIAN YOU GET IT.

CABINS DOWN AND AND THE INTERPRETIVE CENTER ALSO THE STAR SO IT'S OF ARMY BASER THIS WAS AN ARMY BASE RIGHT. THURMOND PARTICULAR IN FORT ROSS I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT.
