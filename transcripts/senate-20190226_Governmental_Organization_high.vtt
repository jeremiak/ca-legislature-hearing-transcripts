00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.484
TO THE TRAVEL GAMING IN STATE

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.521
REVENUE MR APOLOGIZE IF YOU DID.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.556
WITH WE WENT FROM THREE HUNDRED

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:38.324
THIRTY MILLION TO THREE POINT

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.092
SIX MILLION.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.361
YES SO -- IN

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.231
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TWO

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.632
THOUSAND AND SEVEN THERE WAS A

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.535
CHANGE AND THE TERMS OF A NUMBER

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.203
OF CONTACTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.671
AT THAT TIME A NUMBER OF THE

00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:53.973
COMPACTS OF CIVIC OF THE LARGEST

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.275
CONTACTS BEGAN REQUIRING

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.610
PAYMENTS INTO THE STATE GENERAL

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:00.079
FUND INSTEAD OF THE SPECIAL FUND

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:01.680
CALLED THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.182
FIND --

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:04.583
THERE WAS LITIGATION RELATED TO

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.419
THAT -- IT

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.587
WAS BUT IT'S REFER TO THE RING

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.889
CONN DECISION AND BASICALLY THE

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.190
DECISION SAID THAT UPON

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.859
RENEGOTIATION OF THOSE CONTACTS

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.461
THE STATE COULD NOT REQUIRE.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.463
PAYMENTS INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.931
AND SO SINCE THEN AS THE

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.333
CONTACTS HAVE BEEN RENEGOTIATED

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.201
THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:23.736
THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.104
DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.405
HAS BEEN DECLINING AND SO NOW

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.007
WE'RE AT ABOUT THREE POINT SIX

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:29.308
MILLION DOLLARS FROM.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:30.910
I THINK ABOUT TWO OR THREE

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.077
TRIBES THAT ARE STILL PAYING TO

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.145
THE GENERAL FUND.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.513
THOUGH IS THAT MONEY DOWN COMPLY

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.348
COMPLETELY OR IT'S GOING INTO A

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.650
DIFFERENT FUND NOT THE GENERAL

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:41.153
FUND IS SO IT'S IT'S DISTRIBUTED --

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.922
TO DIFFERENT FINES AND THEN

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:43.556
THEY'RE ALSO KIND OF DIFFERENT

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:44.990
TERMS OF IN TERMS IN AGREEMENTS

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.759
THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH CONTACT

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:47.826
SO -- THERE

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:48.394
TO FIND THE REVENUE SHARING

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.828
TRUST FUND THAT I TALKED ABOUT

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:50.896
AS WELL AS OTHER FROM THAT I

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:51.931
REFERENCE THE SPECIAL

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.933
DISTRIBUTION FUND WHICH SUPPORTS

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:58.337
THE STATE'S REGULATORY COSTS

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.805
PROBLEM GAMING CAUSTIC CETERA.

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:00.973
PRIOR TO SOME OF THESE

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.608
RENEGOTIATION BOTH FUNDS HAD

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.342
BEEN AN OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.009
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THE AMOUNT

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.177
OF MONEY GOING OUT.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.145
WAS EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.280
REVENUES COMING IN AND SO IN THE

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.015
RE NEGOTIATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:11.016
OFFICE ESSENTIALLY HAVE BEEN

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.118
RIGHT SIZING THAT MAKING MORE

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.153
PAYMENTS INTO THE REVENUE

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.387
SHARING TRUST FUND.

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:18.757
AND THEN SIMILARLY ADJUSTING

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.559
JEWEL DISTRIBUTION FIND.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.661
THIS NEW FINDS THIS TRIBAL

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:23.662
NATION GRANT FUND THAT WE KIND

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:24.797
OF REFERENCE AS AN EMERGING

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:25.898
ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.666
NEW PRODUCTS RELATED TO THAT AS

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.534
WELL.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:31.136
AND SO THAT IS THE SITUATION OF

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.371
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S MORE

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:33.973
MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE THEN

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.741
NEEDS TO BE MADE FOR THOSE ONE

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:36.609
POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.544
PAYMENTS THEY CAN THEN GO TO

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.846
THESE GRANT PURPOSES.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.215
I THINK YOU WILL ALSO ALSO --

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:46.552
A LOT GOES LOCAL COMMUNITIES YES

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:46.785
ENDS --

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:47.720
THANK YOU SO MUCH --

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.888
THERE ARE AGREEMENTS WITH

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:52.558
COUNTIES AND CITIES --

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.261
A LOT OF THEM INCLUDE OFFSETTING

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:56.862
AT MINIMUM THE COSTS FOR THE FOR

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.731
EXAMPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT ETCETERA

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.266
BUT CAN ALSO INCLUDE OTHER TERMS.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.501
RELATED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.670
IN THE COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS PARKS

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.207
ETCETERA.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:09.708
SO RUBIO CONSIDERABLE I JUST

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.210
HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF FARM

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.978
AID YOU TALK ABOUT THE MERGING

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.747
GAMBLING ISSUES UP FROM STATUS

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:15.848
STATE CAN YOU EDUCATE IN TERMS

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:16.882
OF WHAT.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.885
DO WE HAVE IN PLACE TO SAFEGUARD

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:22.488
BETTING ACOSTA LINES --

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:24.456
AS A RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S KIND OF

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.759
A PATCHWORK OF VARIOUS FEDERAL

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:27.426
LAWS -- I

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.928
THINK THE FEDERAL WIRE ACT AS

00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:31.797
ONE ANOTHER ONE SPECIFICALLY IT

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.165
YOU YOU EACH YEAH I I CAN'T

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.333
REMEMBER THE EXACT WHAT THAT

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.501
ACRONYM STANDS FOR BUT IT

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.202
RELATES TO UNLAWFUL CAN INTERACT

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.470
ACTIVITY --

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.972
SO THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.040
EVENTUALLY.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:45.144
THEN WITHIN THE STATE REALLY

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.745
GAMBLING CONTROL AND IT'S KIND

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.213
OF THE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.782
LETTER THERE ARE KIND OF

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.817
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING AND

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.185
KIND OF FOCUSING ON THAT AND

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.320
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.188
TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE MORE

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:56.755
DETAIL WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:57.723
PRESENTATION [inaudible]

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.326
THANK YOU.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:01.026
ALAN.

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:03.162
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH --

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:06.965
THERE'S THE STATE'S NOT REALLY

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.134
GAINING MUCH BY WAY OF REVENUE

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.803
STATE OR LOCAL.

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:13.672
ONE WITH THE REST OF THIS.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.506
CAN WE HAPPY IN THE STATE I MEAN

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:15.240
EVER EVERYTHING MOST THE

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.475
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:17.943
THAT YOU MENTIONED WERE WERE

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.610
OFFSETS RIGHT I MEAN WE WOULDN'T

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:19.178
HAVE TO HAVE.

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:20.879
A REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR PROBLEM

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.181
GAME IF WE DIDN'T HAVE GAMING.

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.382
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:25.284
ACTUAL POLICE IN THE LOCAL

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.620
COMMUNITIES IF WE DIDN'T HAVE --

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:29.722
MINUTE FOR GAMING THERE SO CAN

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:30.723
YOU GIVE IT.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:32.725
ARE ARE WE NOW AT LEAST.

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.894
MAKING MONEY OR OR THE SORRY WE

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:37.296
AT LEAST LIKE LIKE BREAKING EVEN

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:38.931
SOUNDS LIKE BEFORE WE WERE

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:39.431
LITERALLY THE STATE WAS

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.499
SUBSIDIZING.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.167
GAMING.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.268
SO I THINK WITH THE DIFFERENT

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.336
TYPES OF GAMING THERE ARE

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.304
DIFFERENT GOALS --

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.306
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.007
THINKING ABOUT TRIBAL GAMING.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:49.942
KIND OF THE IMPETUS BEHIND

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.343
TRIBAL GAMING IS REALLY THE SELF

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.379
SUFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIC

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.981
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRACKS IS

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.082
RENT THAT'S ONE CALL --

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.150
THEN IF YOU TURN YOUR ATTENTION

00:16:58.217 --> 00:16:58.884
FOR EXAMPLES THE CALIFORNIA

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.586
STATE LOTTERY ON THAT --

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:03.055
ONE ABOUT IN.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.089
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE ESTIMATE

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.491
IS ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.559
WILL GO TO EDUCATION --

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.094
AND SO THAT IS SOME SUCH A WAY

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.963
THAT THE STATE BENEFITS.

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.664
I THINK IN IN THE OTHER IN SOME

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.133
OF THE OTHER GAMING INDUSTRIES

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.668
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE CARD ROOMS AND

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.236
FORCED AND THE HORSE RACING

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.103
INDUSTRY.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.639
THEY ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:24.009
INCOME TO CAPTURE AT THIS MOMENT

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.411
SO I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU FOR

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:27.212
EXAMPLE IN THIS IN MY TESTIMONY

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.114
THAT CARD ROOMS GENERATED ACTS

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:29.782
MILLION.

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:31.049
AND TAX REVENUE I THINK THAT

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.384
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:34.820
INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCHERS

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.256
HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY --

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:38.323
AND SO THERE IS REVENUE THAT

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.259
COMES IN THERE THERE'S ALSO

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:41.260
REVENUE THAT.

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.429
CAN COME IN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:44.229
THINK THEY'RE CONSTANTLY

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.532
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT IMPACT

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.233
THERE IS ON THE LOCAL

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.536
GOVERNMENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.371
IN WHICH THESE ENTITIES --

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:53.939
OPERATE.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.541
I THINK YOU YOU DO KIND OF

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:57.075
CAPTURE KIND OF THE FLIP SIDE

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.344
WHICH IS THERE ARE COSTS.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.246
RELATE AND MOST NOTABLY RELATED

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.848
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR EXAMPLE

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.917
THAT EAT A LOT OF THE AGREEMENTS

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:05.818
KIND OF FOCUS ON KIND OF AT

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:10.789
LEAST OFFSETTING THE COSTS.

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:13.192
SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:13.792
WHAT SORT OF TAXATION.

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.628
OF GAMBLING PROFITS ARE WE

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.397
ENGAGING IN FOR THESE VERY

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.631
SECTORS.

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.099
OF WHAT MOVES BESIDES FOR FOR

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:22.868
SUPER PROFITS NOT JUST OFFSETS

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.437
ACCUSER IS THERE A OBVIOUSLY

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:27.372
THERE'S INCOME TAX ASSOCIATE

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.140
WITH ANYONE WHO WORKS IN ANY OF

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:29.408
THESE PLACES BUT IS THERE LIKE A

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:31.877
IS THERE ANY KIND OF BUSINESS

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.479
PROFITS TAX FOR A CASINO OR FOR

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:35.047
A CARD ROOM.

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:36.415
THAT'S ONLINE WITH WHAT A

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.549
TYPICAL BUSINESS WOULD PAY.

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:55.305
THAT THIS BACKLOG HAS BEEN

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:56.673

KIND OF A STEEP DIVE AND RATE

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:11.955
THE ARE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.523
LEVELING JUST BECAUSE NOW SOME

WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.632

IT'S IT'S PUZZLING TO ME SINCE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:27.030
NONE OF THIS MONEY COMES FROM

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.765
THE GENERAL FUND.

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:29.966
IN THE MONEY COMES FROM THE

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:33.169
TRIBES AND THE CARD ROOMS.

00:54:33.236 --> 00:54:36.773
IN THIS CASE CARD ROOMS AT WHY

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.476
THEIR LIMITED TERM.

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:41.478
POSITIONS I MEAN THAT THIS IS A

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:42.879

THEY'RE PAYING THESE FUNDS IN

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.016
AND IT JUST IT'S PUZZLING TO ME

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.617
WHY

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:49.285

THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:52.922
LOOK AT THAT.

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.557
THE DIFFERENTLY I I I JUST DON'T

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.526
UNDERSTAND THAT WAY AND IT'S NOT

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.862
GENERAL FUND MONEY IT'S MONEY

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:01.831

TREMENDOUS IMPACT AND NOT JUST

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.426

ABOUT LIKE MAYBE DOING --

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.474
PRE REGULATION WORKSHOPS JUST IN

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.642
A COUPLE PLACES BUT WE DID

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:47.744
SPREAD THEM OUT THROUGHOUT THE

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.512
STATE SO WE COULD GET INPUT FROM

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:50.646
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.515
LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HEAR

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.950
HOW IT MIGHT IMPACT --

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:56.386
WE HAVE MET WITH INDIVIDUALS --

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.554
AND WE I CANNOT STRESS HOW HOW

01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.689
MUCH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:02.959
IMPACTS SO WHEN OUR YOU GO TO

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.193

BENEFITTED FROM PROGRAMS --

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:10.900
AND THEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.769
THE TAX REVENUE IT BRINGS SO WE

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.470
CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT --

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.339
WHEN WE DO DO REGULATIONS WE

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:21.177
MOST LIKELY WILL HAVE TO DO A --

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:23.413
AM WHAT'S COMING KNOWS A SERENA

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:26.416

TO REMEMBER THE ACRONYM --

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:31.054
BUT THAT'S RIPARIAN TO LOOK AT

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.588
ALL THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.991
THE THE REGULATIONS WILL DO SO

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:35.625
WHERE.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.726
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE TERM

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.628
IMPACT ASSESSMENT YES GOTTA TAKE

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:39.896

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:46.369
EVERYONE ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:49.605
THAT'S WHY --

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:52.875
I I I LOOKTO TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.610

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:29.964
MEDICATION VIOLATIONS.

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.100
THE C. HRB HAS THE MOST ROBUST

DRUGS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR

PERMITTED IN RACING.

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.115
AND THE PERMITTED THRESHOLDS FOR

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.616
THOSE IS LESS THAN A GRAIN OF

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:52.120
SALT PER MILLILITER OF BLOOD.

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:52.954

STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:58.493
THE BOARD UTILIZES THE MEDI LAB

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.294
AT UC DAVIS FOR ITS TESTING THE

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.896
LAB IS NOT ONLY ACCREDITED IN

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.200
INTERNATIONALLY.

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:06.934
LAST FISCAL YEAR THE MEDI LAB

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:10.638
ANALYZE THOUSAND A HUNDRED AND

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.273
FIFTY ONE SAMPLES. FOR THE WORST

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.075
RACING BOARD BY WAY OF

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:16.244
COMPARISON YOU SADA ON THE U. S.

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:18.012
ANTI DOPING AGENCY.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.514
TESTED ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.281
SAMPLES DURING THAT SAME TIME

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.150
FRAME.

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.451
THE MAJORITY OF OUR TESTS WERE

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.253
CONDUCTED ON BLOOD AND URINE

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.721
FOLLOWING THE RACE --

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.489
BUT WE ALSOCONDUCT PRE RACE

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.524
TESTING.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.125
OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING SOME

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.693
OF THAT TESTING MIGHT INCLUDE

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.695
HAIR FOLLICLE TESTING.

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.697
WE HAVE FOUR CATEGORIES OF

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:40.268
MEDICATION VIOLATIONS AND RACING.

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.803
THREE OF THEM ARE WHAT WE

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:43.237
CONSIDER TO BE ARE FELONIES

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:46.107
THOSE ARE MEDICATIONS THAT MAY

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.608
ENHANCE PERFORMANCE. FOR THE

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:49.911
FOURTH ARE USUALLY ACCIDENTAL

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:52.046
OVERAGES OF PERMITTED

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.047
MEDICATIONS LIKE ANTI

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.715
INFLAMMATORIES.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.751
SO OF THE FIFTY SIX THOUSAND

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:59.720
SAMPLES TESTED LAST YEAR WE HAD

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:03.024
SIX OF THOSE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS.

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.125
MY PERSONAL VIEW THAT HORSE

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:06.894
RACING AS ARGUABLY THE CLEANEST.

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:08.496
OF ALL THE MAJOR SPORTS.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.064
BUT STILL LIVES WITH THE STIGMAS

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.432
AND STEREOTYPES THAT THERE'S

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.934
MANIPULATION GOING ON BECAUSE

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.002
THERE'S BETTING.

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.704
THE BOARD IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:18.406
FOR MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:19.774
THE WAGERING IN PARA MUTUAL WAY

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:21.442
DURING THE RACE TRACK HAS NO

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:22.043
INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.277
WAGER.

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.679
IT ACTS AS A KIND OF ESCROW

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.681
COMPANY ACCEPTING THE WAITERS

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:28.883
AND PAYING THE WINNERS.

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.018
DURING THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WAY

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.553
DURING BY CALIFORNIANS --

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.789
ON CALIFORNIA RACES OR BY PEOPLE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:36.624
OUT OF STATE ON CALIFORNIA RACES

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.159
TOTAL THREE POINT ONE BILLION

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:40.161
DOLLARS.

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:41.362
THE TAKE OUT WITH HELP FROM

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.930
THESE WAGERS IS DISTRIBUTED

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:44.365
ACCORDING TO STATUTE AND

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.701
ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF WAGER.

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.703
WHERE WAS PLACED AND THE TIME OF

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.805
DAY IT WAS PLACED WE ARE AT THE

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:52.039
RECONCILIATION OF THESE

01:31:52.106 --> 01:31:53.574
DISTRIBUTIONS?

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:56.177
THIS FEATURE BE ALSO LICENSES

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:58.145
SEVEN ONLINE PROVIDERS.

01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.380
THAT'S ACCOUNT WAGERING.

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.982
BETTING ON HORSE RACING IS THE

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:02.884
ONLY LEGAL FORM OF ONLINE

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:03.784
WAGERING --

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.286
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.021
THIS TYPE OF WAGERING NOW

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.857
COMPRISES ABOUT 2121% OF THE

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:12.994
TOTAL HANDLE.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.395
I KNOW LIKE TO ADDRESS ARE

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:17.665
RACING SAFETY PROGRAM.

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:20.067
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A RACE HORSE

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:21.168
IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING THAT

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.737
WE DO.

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.338
THERE'S GREAT SENSITIVITY TO THE

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:27.808
CARE AND WELFARE OF THE HORSE.

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.310
THE HORSE RACING BOARD THROUGH

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.845

WE DEVELOP A NEW RACING --

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:44.158

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.560
PERFORMED IN A WORK OUT AND HAD

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.429
A POST RACE TESTS DONE --

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.064
AND ARE APPROVED BY THE

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:26.267
VETERINARIAN TO RETURN TO RACING --

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.802
THAT'S A LOT OF HORSES ACTUALLY

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.438
THAT ARE IDENTIFIED EVERY DAY --

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:31.772
AND THOSE HORSES ARE SUBMITTED

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.274
TO ENHANCED EXAMINATIONS

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.309
ORDINARILY A WORSE THIS GONNA

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.444
RUN IN A RACE.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.945
IS SEEN BY OUR OFFICIAL

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:39.180
VETERINARIAN ON THE MORNING OF

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:40.614
THE RACE EVERY HORSE THAT RACES

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:41.983
IS EXAMINED.

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.617
BUT THESE HORSES ARE EXAMINED

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:45.653
MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEY'RE

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.556
ALLOWED. TO ENTER TO RUN.

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.691
THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME BENEFITS

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:52.126
TO THIS PROGRAM WHICH FRANKLY WE

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:53.627
DIDN'T ANTICIPATE.

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:56.063
THIS SCRUTINY HAS CAUSED THE

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.064
PEOPLE THAT CARE FOR THESE

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.632
HORSES TO BE AMERICAN MORE AWARE

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.568
OF THE FACT THAT THEY MAY HAVE

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:02.269
AN ISSUE --

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.671
SO THAT IS HELPFUL ALSO THE

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.606
VETERINARIANS THAT SEE THESE

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:07.608
SOURCES WHETHER IT'S IN THE BARN.

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:08.843
OWL OR WHEN THEY'RE TAKING OVER

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.411
TO THE RECEIVING BARN BEFORE THE

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.846
RACE WHEN THEY GO INTO THE

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:14.081
SADDLING PADDOCK BEFORE THE RACE

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:14.949
AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE OUT ON THE

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.050
RACETRACK.

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.585
THE VETERINARIANS THAT ARE THERE

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:18.452
THE OFFICIAL OR TRACK

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.588
VETERINARIANS REALIZE THAT THESE

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.556
HORSES --

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:24.625
DESERVE A SECOND LOOK.

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:26.160
AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:27.661
SIGNIFICANT.

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:28.696
IMPROVEMENTS --

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.698
IN.

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:33.300
THE SAFETY OF HORSES WE HAVE A A

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.835
RULE THAT SAYS THAT ANY WORSE

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:36.971
THAT DIES WITHIN AN ENCLOSURE OF

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.672
A C. H. R. B. FACILITY.

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:41.475
MUST BE NECROPSY BY UC DAVIS.

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:44.578
THAT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN --

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:46.213
NINETEEN NINETY LAST YEAR WE HAD

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.381
THE FEWEST NUMBER OF NEW CROP

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:50.151
SEES IN TWENTY NINE YEARS.

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:51.185
SO.

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.453
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.255
BUT WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:56.891
FACT THAT A SINGLE HORSE LOST.

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.025
IS TOO MANY.

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:58.793
BUT I WANT TO ASSURE THIS

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.428
COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS THE

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.663
HIGHEST PRIORITY. FOR THE HORSE

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:06.600
RACING BOARD NOT TOP NOT TROLL --

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:07.501
BUT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:08.903
WE CAN.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.438
WE HAVE OTHER SAFETY ISSUES THAT

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:12.139
I'D LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU WE

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:15.209
ARE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION.

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:17.078
THAT RESTRICTS THE USE OF THE

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.980
RIDING CROP DURING A RACE --

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:21.949
IF IT THE JOCKEY A USE OF THE

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:23.217
RIDING CROP MORE THAN THREE

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:24.618
TIMES IN SUCCESSION WITHOUT

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.020
GIVING A WORSE A CHANCE TO

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:26.854
RESPOND.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:29.356
BATS A VIOLATION OF OUR RULES IF

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:30.991
THE JOCKEY --

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:32.593
VIOLATES THAT RULE MORE THAN

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.428
ONCE THEN THE PENALTY IS

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:35.729
INCREASED.

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:37.465
AND THAT CAN RESULT IN ALWAYS

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:40.267
RESULTS IN FINES AND CAN RESULT

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:41.836
IN SUSPENSIONS AS WELL.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.804
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WITH

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:45.673
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS RULE

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.775
ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO?

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.510
THE WRITING HAS GOTTEN MORE

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.712
PROFESSIONAL IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:53.614
THE USE OF THE RIDING CROP HAD

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.683
BECOME KIND OF A CRUNCH FOR

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:57.885
JOCKEYS.

01:35:57.952 --> 01:35:59.253
NOW THERE ARE USING THE HANDS

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.721
MORE OFTEN THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:02.790
PROFESSIONAL RIDERS WE HAVE THE

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.391
BEST IN THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.426
WITH HERE GENERALLY IN

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:06.694
CALIFORNIA.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.962
AND THIS IS MADE THEM EVEN

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:09.497
BETTER -- WE

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:12.199
REPORT ALMOST.

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:14.068
IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE SEE AN

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:16.403
INJURY TO A HORSE BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:18.405
USE OF THE CROP THE CROP ITSELF

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.674
HAS BEEN CHANGED IT SHORTER.

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:22.476
I'D USED TO BE USED TO HAVE A

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.545
LIKE A VINYL AND ON IT --

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:27.214
AND NOW THAT THE END ON IT IS --

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:30.117
MADE OF MICROPHONE OR WHATEVER

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:32.419
THEY CALL THAT --

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:34.989
SO IT'S VERY SOFT VERY FORGIVING

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:37.024
AND SO WE THINK WE'RE MOVING IN

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.092
THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE AND

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:39.527
ALSO I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.162
IS THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS A

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:42.530
SAFETY STORED PROGRAM.

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:43.964
THIS THIS PROGRAM WAS

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:45.566
ESTABLISHED BY MY PREDECESSOR

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.801
KIRK BREED ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO.

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.170
AND WHEREAS THE STORES THAT I

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.871
DESCRIBED BEFORE ARE THE JUDGES

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.806
AND THEY BASICALLY ARE

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:53.374
MONITORING EVERYTHING THAT'S

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.776
GOING ON THESE TWO WORDS WORK ON

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:57.711
THEIR BEHALF TO BE IN THE STABLE

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:59.713
AREA ON THE RACE TRACK AT ALL

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.215
TIMES MONITORING SAFETY.

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:02.816
FROM SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MAKING

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:04.351
SURE THAT ANYBODY ON HORSEBACK

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:06.320
AS A SAFETY VEST THE RIGHT TYPE

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.088
OF HELMET MAKING SURE THE RIDING

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.790
CROPS --

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:12.026
COMPLY WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.594
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE IN

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:16.263
THE STABLE AREA THEY HAVE BECOME --

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.832
THE EYES AND EARS EXTENDED EYES

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.634
AND EARS FOR OUR INVESTIGATORS

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:22.303
AND ANYTHING THAT THEY SEE THAT

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.871
THEY REALIZE THE POTENTIAL

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.105
VIOLATION --

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:27.541
THEY SECURE THE LOCATION AND

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:27.975
THEY CALL ONE OF OUR

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:29.710
INVESTIGATORS.

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:32.279
WE'RE ALSO VERY.

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.882
LUCKY TO HAVE.

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:35.849
COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.551
GOVERNOR.

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.986
WHO HAVE A CARE FOR THE RACE

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.621
HORSE?

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:42.790
WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.325
CARE WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.660
DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:47.928
PUBLIC IN THE RIGHT THING FOR

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.830
THE INDUSTRY --

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:51.699
AND YOU KNOW IT OVER THE YEARS

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.467
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT MORE BY

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:58.472
SOME AS A A LEGAL OFFICE --

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.808
HELL WARD OTHERS MAY BE AS SOME

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:01.909
KIND OF MARKETING PARTNER.

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:03.043
A REMAND I REMIND EVERYBODY

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.379
WE'RE NOT THAT --

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.881
WE'RE REGULATORS WHO ENFORCE THE

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:08.983
LAW WHEN FORCE THE RULES AND

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.719
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE.

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.654
AND WE DO HAVE THIS SPECTACULAR

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:15.589
CREATURE THIS BEAUTIFUL REYES

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:17.558
SOURCE -- AS

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:18.859
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:20.594
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND SO

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:21.662
WHAT IT TO KEEP SUCH PASSIONATE

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:24.131
ABOUT IT.

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.199
THANK YOU IT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:38:25.266 --> 01:38:27.868
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

THE CENTER OUR PERHAPS --

01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:33.407
IT'S MORE TIRED THE HELL NO NO

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:34.775
THIS IS A MORE SERIOUS.

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:36.043
QUESTION YOU KNOW --

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.810
I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:37.911
TALKING ABOUT TERM SAFETY I WILL

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:40.948
SAY IN TODAY'S MY LA TIMES THIS

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.016
MORNING OPEN IT UP.

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:43.851
AND THERE'S AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW --

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:47.488
SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH DAY --

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:49.156
SANITY TO RACE TRACK JUST

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:50.991
SUFFERED ITS NINETEENTH HORSE

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:53.294
DESK NINETEEN WORK RESOURCES

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.829
HAVE DIED AT SANTA ANITA.

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.865
SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH.

01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.734
ALONE SO WE'RE LOSING A HORSE.

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.569
A BEAUTIFUL RESOURCE EVERY TWO

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:05.339
OR THREE DAYS WITHOUT A TYPO OR

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.074
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON IT'S IN

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:07.474
INDIA.

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.243
WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.244
THAT WE'VE BEEN.

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.812
ASKING AND TRYING TO ANSWER OVER

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.781
THE LAST MANY WEEKS --

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:16.050
THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:18.719
WHEN THERE'S HEAVY RAINS IN THE

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.654
TRACK IS MANIPULATED.

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.022
IT IS WHAT THEY CALL SEALED IN

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.791
ANTICIPATION OF A RACE --

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:25.459
I'M SORRY OF A RAINSTORM.

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.328
A MINUTE AFTER THE RAIN STORM IT

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.829
IS OPEN BACK UP AGAIN.

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:31.932
AND WHEN WE HAVE THE DROUGHT

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.300
YEARS.

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:34.902
WE HAD A WONDERFUL SAFETY

01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:37.237
NUMBERS.

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:38.472
BUT NOW WITH THESE CHANGING

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.474
RACETRACKS SOMETIMES THREE OR

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.009
FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRACKS

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:43.243
IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK.

01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.712
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE WEATHER'S

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:47.414
DOING WHAT THE MAINTENANCE IS --

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.248
IT PUTS SUSCEPTIBLE HORSES AT

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.150
RISK.

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:52.653
IT IS AN INEXACT SCIENCE.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.255
A SANTA NEED AS WE SPEAK HAS THE

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:57.291
THE PERSON IS --

01:39:57.358 --> 01:39:58.492
BELIEVE TO BE THE FOREMOST

01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:01.628
AUTHORITY ON THESE SERVICES AT

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.497
SANITY'S OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:08.335
BOARD'S INTERVENTION OVER THE

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:11.305
WEEKEND LET ME STIPULATE THAT.

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:12.606
THIS IS PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:14.141
FOR THE BOARD.

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:17.211
BECAUSE WE HAVE SPECIFIC RULES

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:18.645
AND REGULATIONS THOSE ARE EASY

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:21.215
TO ENFORCE.

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:22.549
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:23.617
MAINTENANCE OF THE RACE TRACK

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:27.321
LIES WITH THE ASSOCIATION.

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:27.921
HOW THEY DO COME BEFORE THE

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:30.224
BOARD MULTIPLE TIMES PER YEAR

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:31.592
AND THEY HAVE TO PRESENT THEIR

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.327
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND THEY

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.595
HAVE TO SHOW AS INDIVIDUALS OR

01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.430
QUALIFIED TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.498
RACETRACK AND SO FORTH?

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:38.966
BUT THE ONLY ACTION THAT THE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.033
BOARD CAN REALLY TAKE IN A

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.102
SITUATION LIKE THIS IS TO SHUT

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.171
IT DOWN.

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:45.806
AND I GOTTA TELL YA THERE'S BEEN

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:46.907
TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:48.409
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WE LOOK AT

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:49.777
THE WHOLE PICTURE.

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:52.446
THIS THIS NUMBER THIS.

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.214
NINETEEN IS MORE THAN DOUBLE.

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.416
THE NUMBER LAST YEAR AT THE SAME

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:57.718
TIME.

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:58.552
I WILL SAY TO YOU TO KEEP IN

01:40:58.619 --> 01:41:01.021
MIND THAT.

LAST YEAR THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:06.627
THOUSAND STARTERS IN RACES.

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:08.495
WORK OUTS EACH DAY THERE WILL BE

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:09.997

01:41:17.438 --> 01:41:20.140
THE AFTERNOON.

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.141
THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.510
QUESTION. FOR THE BOARD TO

01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:25.179
ANSWER [inaudible]

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:28.782
BECAUSE WHEN YOU.

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.019
DOWN --

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.921
YOU'RE ALSO TAKING PEOPLE'S

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:34.555
LIVELIHOODS AWAY FROM THEM AND

CONVINCE THEM TO SHUT DOWN THE

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:50.737
RACETRACK ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:52.773

AND WILD HORSE WAS LOST --

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:05.018
SO THEY GOT THE TRACK CLOSE TO

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:13.794
FORWARD BUT AGAIN.

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:15.362
THE ONLY ACTION REALLY THAT THE

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:17.197
BOARD CAN TAKE OTHER THEN URGING

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:19.433
CAJOLING AND PUSHING --

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.568
IS TO SHUT THE INDUSTRY DOWN TO

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.703
SUSPEND.

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:25.038

WITH THE WET CONDITIONS A HORSE

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:32.946
LOSES ITS FOOTING THE BRICKELL

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.147
BREAK A LEG AND HAVE TO BE PUT

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.149
DOWN AS THAT IS ACTIVELY WHAT'S

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:39.686

RACING SERVICE THAT'S

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.194
EVERYBODY'S GOAL --

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.862

IF YOU IF THE IF.

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.298
IF IT WAS JUST UP TO THE TRACK

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:53.166
MAINTENANCE CREW --

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:53.800
YOU KNOW THEY'VE THEY'VE THEY

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.502

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:56.169
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THEY THEY HAVE

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:57.604
THESE THE UP MONSTROUS TRACTORS%

01:42:57.671 --> 01:43:00.374
AND AND HEROES THAT THAT

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.309
MANICURED ALL DAY LONG.

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:03.777

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:06.647
CONSISTORIES TRACKS OFF I'M

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:08.215
TRAINING WORSE OVER THAT SERVICE

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:09.917
I CAN EXPECT THAT THREE DAYS

01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:10.751
FROM NOW IF I TAKE HIM OUT THERE

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:11.518
AGAIN.

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:12.486
HE WILL TRAIN OR A VERY SIMILAR

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:16.056
SERVICE HOWEVER IF I HAVE BEEN

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:17.524
TRAINING OVER THAT SERVICE AND

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.127
NOW I RACE THE HORSE OVER A

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.662
SERVICE THAT'S BEEN SEALED.

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:23.430
IT'S HARDER.

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:24.898
IT'S MUCH MORE FIRM THAN WHAT

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:26.700
THE THE HORSE HAD BEEN TRAINING

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:28.769
ON CELL THAT'S TODAY TODAY'S

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:30.203
RAINING AND WE RACE ON THAT

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.005
SERVICE.

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.507
TOMORROW THE SUN COMES BACK OUT

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:34.975
WHAT WE STILL HAVE A MUDDY.

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.476
SURFACE THAT'S COMPLETELY

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:37.444
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE HORSES

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.813
MEANT TRAINING ON IT'S A

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.481
COMBINATION OF THAT

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:44.284
BURIED SERVICE IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:45.586
AND OF COURSE THAT IS

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:47.821
SUSCEPTIBLE WE HAVE.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:50.223
SUSCEPTIBLE TO INJURY WE HAVE

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.792
DATA THAT SHOWS FROM BERNIE

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:53.026
CROPSEY STUDIES.

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:53.994
AND BY THE WAY THAT DEBT AS

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:56.396
COMPARED WITH INJURY DATABASES

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:57.998
FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:58.999
WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:02.302
THERE IN ALMOST 90%.

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:04.571
OF FATAL INJURIES.

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:06.907
THERE IS PRE EXISTING PATH OLOGY

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:08.475
NOW SOME OF THAT MIGHT GO BACK

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:09.876
TO WIN THE WORSE WAS ON THE FARM

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.511
AS A YEARLING.

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:15.716
AND INJURED A LEG AND IT MAY NOT.

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:18.485
BE EVIDENT EVEN EVEN WITH A

01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:19.853
DIGITAL RADIOLOGY IT MAY NOT BE

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.588
EVIDENT.

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:24.157
SO BECAUSE THESE ARE ANIMALS AND

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.726
WE WE THE IT'S ALSO VERY

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:26.627
DIFFICULT TO YOU KNOW

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:26.927
[inaudible]

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:29.229
PERFORM.

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:30.464
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.799
THINGS LIKE CAT SCANS AND MRI

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:36.370
EYES ON ON ON THESE ANIMALS --

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:37.838
YOU'D HAVE TO SEDATE THEM

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.673
DRAMATICALLY TO GET THEM TO

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.074
WITHSTAND IT PASTA TO JUST

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:43.510
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE ACT

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:45.178
TYPE OF EQUIPMENT DOESN'T EXIST.

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:47.314
FOR RACE HORSES SO IT'S ALL OF

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:49.783
THOSE FACTORS SIR AND I TELL YOU

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:50.917
WE DO IT'S THE IT'S THE MOST

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:53.286
DIFFICULT THING THAT WE WE DEAL

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:56.390
WITH AS A REGULATORY BODY --

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:58.125
HIM.

01:44:58.191 --> 01:44:59.826
EVERY YEAR I GUESS HOW DO YOU AT

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:00.460
WHAT POINT.

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.194
I MEAN IS THERE IS THERE A

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:03.130
THRESHOLD OF DEATHS AT THESE

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:03.664
RACE.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:04.698
TRACKS WHERE YOU WERE FINALLY

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:07.067
TRIGGERS --

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:08.268
A DECISION TO SHUT DOWN OR HOW

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.703
HOW DO YOU EVALUATE THAT I

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:10.971
UNDERSTAND IT'S DIFFICULT LIKE I

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:11.905
TOTALLY GET THE ECONOMIC

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:15.409
IMPLICATIONS --

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:16.610
BUT WITH THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.744
GOING TO BE THERE WHETHER HAVING

01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:20.480
TEN DEATHS OR HUNDRED OR FIVE

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:21.782
HUNDRED DEATHS AT YOU KNOW --

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:23.550
AGAIN IN THE CONTEXT OF OF WHAT

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:24.985
I WAS JUST SAYING YOU KNOW THIS

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:27.254
IS -- IN BY

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.556
THE WAY I IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:30.657
TO SIT HER BEFORE YOU AND TALK

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.125
ABOUT ALL THESE GAINS THAT WE'VE

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:33.527
MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:35.796
IN THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:37.531
HORSES WHICH IS TRUE THAT

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:38.832
STATISTICAL.

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:40.300
AND YET IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.835
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:43.336
WE HAVE THE SITUATION AT SANTA

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.304
ANITA --

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:45.639
THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT I'VE JUST

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.574
SAID -- WE

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:49.209
ADDRESS THE SITUATION AS IT

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:50.444
COMES UP WE HAD A SIMILAR

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.745
SITUATION AT DEL MAR THREE

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:53.847
SUMMERS AGO --

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:56.149
WHERE WE HAD A NUMBER OF FORCES

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:59.152
ON THE TURF COURSE THERE --

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:00.554
SUFFER FATAL INJURIES WE HAD

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.790
LIKE SIX IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS.

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:07.160
AND WE CONVINCED MANAGEMENT WAS

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:09.463
VERY COOPERATIVE. TO TAKE ALL

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:09.996
THE RACING OFF OF THE TURF

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:10.697
COURSE [inaudible]

01:46:10.764 --> 01:46:14.568
THEY DID.

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:15.702
AND THE TREND STOPPED.

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:18.205
SO WE'RE AT THE SIMILAR STAGE

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:19.473
NOW I WOULD SAY WE'VE HAD IT'S

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:21.108
BEEN.

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:24.344
SPEND POSITIVE SINCE THEN.

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:25.679
AGAIN WE HAVE THESE GOOD RESULTS

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:27.848
NOW WE HAVE THIS [inaudible]

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:29.649
SITUATION THAT.

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:31.318
IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THE

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:33.386
RACETRACK.

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:35.589
THE THE HORSE THAT THAT MAY HAVE

01:46:35.655 --> 01:46:36.923
SUFFERED AN INJURY REGARDLESS

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.492
THE RACE TRACK.

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.494
AND THE FACT THAT WE DO SEA

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.995
ANOMALIES NOW AND THEN AND TO

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:43.730
USUALLY WE ONLY.

01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:44.831
PUT OUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.833
THE FATALITIES THAT THE END OF

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.101
THE FISCAL YEAR ONE WE HAVE ALL

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.336
THE NEW CROPS HE'S BACK AND WE

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.705
KNOW WHAT THE WE HAVE A BETTER

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:52.239
IDEA OF WHAT THE CAUSE AND

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:53.206
EFFECT IS.

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.342
SO WE'VE TAKEN THIS FIRST STEP

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:57.410
OF OF CONVINCING THE RACE TRACK

01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:58.745
TO SHUT DOWN.

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:00.213
THEY'VE TOLD US THAT IF THAT

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.348
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:02.749

DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO THE RACE

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.619
TRACTORS THE CUSHION WHICH IS A

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:06.653
SOFT PART.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.988
ON TOP WHICH IS ABOUT THREE AND

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:09.589
A HALF INCHES UNDERNEATH THAT IS

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:13.660
A PAD A PAD OF OF A PRETTY FIRM

01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:14.995
SAND.

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:16.429
THEN UNDERNEATH THAT IS THE BASE

01:47:16.496 --> 01:47:19.733
SEVERAL LAYERS AGES AND SO FORTH.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.268
SO THEY'VE PEELED AWAY THE TOP

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:23.036
PART OF IT THEY'VE EVALUATED NOW

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:25.505

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.782
ASSURED US THAT IF THEY FIND

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.450
THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS.

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:39.519
THAT THEY WILL NOT ONLY CANCEL

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.988
TRAINING TOMORROW BUT POSSIBLY

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:45.292

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:46.359
DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY FIND COME.

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:47.360
VISIT LAST QUESTION DID YOU HAVE

SO THE NUMBERS THIS YEAR ARE NOT

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.664

DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:10.363
IT'S NOT A REGULATORY DECISION

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.365
