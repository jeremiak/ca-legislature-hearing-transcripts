THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS ARE FOCUSING ON THE STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST HELP CHRONICALLY ABSENT STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH STRUGGLING AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED NEEDED TARGET SCHOOLS -- WE HAVE A FOCUS ON ALL SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES IN THE RED TIER BETTER WITH WITH LESS THAN EIGHT CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MUST OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO ALL STUDENTS IN K. THREE SIX IN ADDITION TO THE K. TWELVE COHORTS AND WE FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THAT -- ALL SCHOOLS MUST CONTINUE TO ALLOW FAMILIES TO CHOOSE CHOICE AGAIN BETWEEN DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THEIR STUDENTS OR IN PERSON SMALLER COHORTS TO ADDRESS STUDENT AND FAMILY NEEDS -- WE DO FOCUS AND ON HOW WE WOULD ALLOCATE THE MONEY THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET IN JANUARY THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION RECOVERY FUNDS AND THE TWO BILLION FOR A RE OPENING LASTLY FOR VACCINES WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON HAVING OUR SCHOOLS PUT ESSENTIAL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES FIRST IN LINE IN THE STATE'S VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS AS WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA WILL SET ASIDE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE STATE'S VACCINES TO SUPPORT GETTING ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES READY FOR SAFE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND AGAIN WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN OUR COMMITTEE LAST FEW WEEKS SUB SIX WE DO HOPE TO HAVE A BILL THAT WE CAN VOTE ON IN THE SUBS FOR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND AND THE FULL ASSEMBLY IN THE COMING DAYS -- SO WITH THAT I KNOW PEOPLE WILL MAYBE WANT TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THIS WE'RE NOT VOTING ON THIS TODAY BY IS ONE OF TO IT TOOK TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT IS OF COURSE WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT TODAY'S REOPENING OUR SCHOOLS SO IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT THREE FOUR MONTHS AGO AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY -- SO WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A A PRESENTATION FIRST ROUND -- DR HEATHER HUGH WHO'S A RESEARCHER FROM A PACE AS WELL AS A DOCTOR HI THOMAS COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND WILL BEGIN WITH THEM FOCUSING ON THE STATUS STUDENT OUTCOMES CALIFORNIA THE COMMISSION TWENTY TWO ANYTHING HERE PLEASE BEGIN HELLO THIS IS HEATHER HAVE WITH PACE CAN YOU HEAR ME HI THIS IS HEATHER HELP WITH PACE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M HERE TODAY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT COPE WITH IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A GREAT DAY TO INFRASTRUCTURE THANK YOU KNOW UNTIL FRIDAY WE DIDN'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH SCHOOLS WERE OPENED OR CLOSED WE DON'T HAVE A FORMULA FOR DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS THAT SCALE AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL BY GRADE FOR SOCCER FOR INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND STUDENT LEARNING ALWAYS COMES FROM A SUBSET OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA BUT USING THIS INFORMATION WE CAN PAINT A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE OF THE IMPACT OF CORPORATE NINETEEN ON STUDENTS IN THE ELEVEN MONTHS AND SCHOOLS AND ACTUALLY CLOSED IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY SO I'M GOING TO START WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT COPING IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED RESEARCHERS HAVE WORKED TO PROTECT FIRST AND THEN TEST MAKE IMPACT EXTENDED EDUCATIONAL DISRUPTIONS ON STUDENT LEARNING NATIONAL STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT SETBACKS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH RESULTS VERY QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDING ON THE SAMPLE A LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT -- RELATIONS ACROSS STATE BUT ALSO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS -- HOW STUDENTS ARE BEING EDUCATED HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE OUT OF SCHOOL IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY AND IN THROUGH THE SUMMER NOW THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF VARIATION WITH MANY U. S. SCHOOLS IN PERSON WHILE THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS ARE STILL IN THE LEARNING SO FOR THIS REASON IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF ENDEMIC FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SKEPTICALLY SO CASE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT EDUCATION ANALYTICS AND THE CORE DISTRICTS UTILIZED FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DATA IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND IN MATH OR FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN GRADES FOUR THROUGH TEN AND EIGHTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT ARE PART OF THE CORE DATA COLLABORATIVE THE FULL COMMENTARY COPE WITH NINETEEN AND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY CRISIS CAN BE FOUND ON OUR HOMEPAGE AT AT AT THE NCAA DOT WORK WE ALSO MADE A SUMMARY HANDOUT FOR THE HEARING IN OUR STUDY LIKE OTHERS OF ITS KIND WE COMPARE LEARNING RATES DURING THE PANDEMIC TO LEARNING RATE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE OBSERVED DURING THE PANDEMIC OR WHAT WE CALL LEARNING LOSSES AND THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WOULD HOPE STUDENTS TO WHEN A CUMULATE IN ANY GIVEN TIME THAT THEY DIDN'T ACCUMULATE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS WE USE OUR MAP AND STARKEL COMPLETE YOUR STANDARDS BASED AND DOCTOR AND THEY WERE ADMINISTERED BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER IN ALICE THIS THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY FIFTH BOTTOM HAS MEASURING COPE WITH IMPACT AT THE TIME THAT SCHOOL STARTED ALL OVERALL WE FIND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT LEARNING LOSS IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH WITH STUDENTS IN GRADES FOUR THROUGH SIX THE MOST IMPACTED ESTIMATES VARY BY GRADE AND ASSESSMENT BUT OUR ANALYSES SHOW THAT STUDENTS NEEDS GREATER BEHIND FIVE BETWEEN FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BEHIND WHERE THEY WOULD BE IN A TYPICAL YEAR AVERAGES MASK VERY SERIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENT GROUPS LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN MOST RATES FOR BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH AND ACROSS BOTH ASSESSMENT PROCESS SCHEDULING MORE LEARNING TENDED HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS IN SOME GRADES LOWER INCOME STUDENTS LOST LEARNING WHILE HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS LEARNING ACTUALLY ACCELERATED AND FOR STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH AND NEARLY EVERY GRADE AND YEAH IN THIS LANGUAGE ARTS AND EARLY GRADES FOR MATH ACROSS BOTH ASSESSMENTS THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL LEARNING LOSS STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH LOSING THIRTY PERCENT IN GRADE FIVE OF A TYPICAL YEAR WELL OTHER STUDENTS ONLY LOST ABOUT TEN PERCENT SO THIS IS BOTH SHOWING THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC THAT SOME STUDENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED MUCH MORE AND THIS IS ON TOP OF WHAT WE'RE ALREADY VERY PERSISTENT AND PERVASIVE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BETWEEN GROUPS THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A FANNING OUT OF IT SHE MADE GAPS AS A RESULT THE PANDEMIC WITH SOME STUDENTS FALLING VERY QUICKLY BEHIND OTHER STUDENTS STAYING ON TRACK OR FALLING BEHIND AT A LOWER RATE BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHY WE'RE SEEING THESE GAPS EMERGED DISTANCE LEARNING REQUIRES A STABLE HOME ENVIRONMENT HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY RELIABLE ACCESS TO WIFI AND COMPUTERS AND AN ADULT AT HOME TO SUPERVISE IN THE EARLY GRADES WHEN STUDENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS OR NAVIGATE ONLINE ASSIGNMENT FOR MANY STUDENTS IN THE UPPER GRADES TWO DON'T HAVE STRONG SELF MANAGEMENT SKILLS OR WHO NEED SUPPORT TO STAY ON TASK AND LEARNING THIS IS CREATING A LARGE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN HER LEGS STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES CAN HIRE A FULL TIME TUTOR OR EVEN A POTENTIAL TEACHER WHO HAVE A PARENT AT HOME FULL TIME AND OTHERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE AN ADULT AT HOME AT ALL OR ANY ADULT WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH OR DOES NOT HAVE THE EDUCATION OR TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO THE COURT LEARNING OR TECHNOLOGY YEARS I MEAN WE HAVE TO OF COURSE ACTIVE TO THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF THE VIRUS ITSELF WE KNOW THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BOTH HEALTH AND ECONOMICS HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME BLACK AND LYFT NEXT COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCOME INEQUALITY AND DISPROPORTIONATE EMPLOYMENT IN HIGH RISK POSITIONS IT ALSO IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE THAT STUDENTS CANNOT ACCESS LEARNING THEIR BASIC NEEDS ARE MET AND WE KNOW THAT SOME STUDENTS MAY ALSO BE FACING OF LAPTOP USE OR EVEN A COLLECTED HIGH WITHOUT SCHOOLS TO STEP IN AND HELP WITH THOSE NEEDS RIGHT MAYBE THEY DID BEFORE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC ISSUES FOR STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH AND THEY JUST ARE NOT LEARNING ENGLISH REQUIRES OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH CLASSMATES WITHOUT THIS INTERACTION IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE AND WITHOUT THE KIND OF SUPPORT FOR ACCESSING GRADE LEVEL CONTENT IN ENGLISH WILL BE VERY HARD FOR THEM TO STAY ON GRADE LEVEL ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT BY DEFINITION THERE AND HOME WORKING WHICH IS NOT SPOKEN AND SO THE ADULT THERE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP WITH CONTENT STILL RELEASED FINDINGS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO SIMILARLY FACE YOU NEED TO BUT SIMILAR CHALLENGES HAVE INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS WHICH DETAIL THE KIND OF SPECIALIZED SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED AND IT'S UNLIKELY THAT PARENTS WILL HAVE THE TYPES OF SKILLS AND TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THOSE SERVICES A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THAT THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS RECORDED THAT THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING ANY SUPPORT AT ALL IN OUR ANALYSIS WE ALREADY KNOW THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WERE MISSING AND ALMOST NOT MUCH RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT -- WHO IS BEING ASSESSED AND WHAT THAT MEANS ABOUT THESE KINDS OF LEARNING LAS ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY THIS ISSUE OF MISSING STUDENTS IS A HUGE CONCERN BECAUSE WE'RE COMPLETELY BLIND TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THEM I DON'T KNOW IF MAKING DISENGAGEMENT SCHOOL AND HIGHER EARLY IF THEY MOVED AWAY IF THEY'RE IN A CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAM HOME SCHOOL PROGRAM OR PRIVATE SCHOOL OR IF THEY'RE OKAY AT ALL IF THEY'RE MISSING FROM THE ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE DISENGAGED FROM SCHOOL ALTOGETHER THE OVERALL IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING IS MUCH MORE DIRE THAN OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS IN ALMOST EVERY ANALYSIS OF LEARNING THAT I'VE SEEN THERE'S TYPICALLY BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE MISSING ACT THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY KIND OF INSTRUCTION ON MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN ANY ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN US FAR AND WE KNOW THAT ENROLLMENT OVERALL IS DOWN PREVIOUS ANALYSIS BY CD EASTER JUST THAT STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT IS DOWN A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ALICE'S FROM SOME OF OUR STATE'S LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOWS THAT KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT IS DOWN NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT IS DOWN TO THERE'S MORE REASON TO BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE EARLY GRADES I THINK STUDENTS RE ENROLL IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE DUSTER KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE VERY FAR BEHIND AND EVEN FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL DISTANCE LEARNING IS GENERALLY HARDEST FOR THE YOUNGEST STUDENTS IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PAY ATTENTION MAKE GENERALLY LEARN THROUGH PLAY AN ENGAGEMENT LETTER LACKING ANYTHING CLASSROOMS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO BUILD BASIC SKILLS LIKE REALLY LITERACY AND NUMERACY WITHOUT TEACHER AND PEER INTERACTION WELL WE DON'T HAVE GREAT DATA ON EARLY GRADE LEARNING AT SCALE HE DOES HAVE AN UPCOMING ANALYSIS SHOWING THAT STUDENTS READING CURRENCY IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND BUT WE WOULD EXPECT IN A TYPICAL YEAR STUDENTS IN NEED EARLY GRADES DON'T DEVELOP BASIC SKILLS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACCESS FUTURE BUT WE ALSO HAVE REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT UPPER GRADE STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE -- TROUBLING SIGNS THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE NOT ENGAGING WITH DISTANCE LEARNING IN SACRAMENTO CITY TEN TIMES MORE STUDENTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DISENGAGED COMPARED TO LAST YEAR D. AND F. GRADES ARE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND LOS ANGELES UNIFIED THE NUMBER OF TEETH IN ASTON BREAK NINE THROUGH TWELVE INCREASED BY EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FALL COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WITH THE GREATEST INCREASE AMONG BLACK NOT BLACK AND LATIN ACCIDENTS AND RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT TRANSITION YEARS BETWEEN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND INTO POSTSECONDARY ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS SO IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO GET THEM BACK ON TRACK AND IT ISN'T JUST ACHIEVEMENT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH IS SUFFERING AS WELL RATES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE UP NATIONWIDE AS WELL AS SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND STUDENTS NINE DISCONNECTED FROM SCHOOL AND FROM RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PEERS AND EDUCATORS SO HE'S A VERY INTENSE PICTURE BUT IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE FATALISTIC RATHER FOR US TO GIVE YOU A REALISTIC ABOUT INSIST THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE HAPPENING WE NEED TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES AND THE WIDENING UP NEEDS GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC WE NEED ASSESSMENTS AT SCALE WE NEED A ROBUST SYSTEM UP EQUITY INDICATORS TO MONITOR HOW OUR SYSTEMS ARE PERFORMING FOR STUDENTS WE NEED A LARGE INVESTMENT NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GO BACK TO NORMAL BECAUSE NORMAL WAS ALREADY NOT SERVING STUDENTS IN OUR STATE TO A LARGE DEGREE AND WE HAVE A VERY HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF STUDENT NEED SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES AND OR TO THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU DR MOLINO YES GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES THANK YOU PERFECT GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP DURING THE ACADEMIC NO IT'S NOT AN INCREDIBLE THAT'S FOR EVERYONE WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP I VALUE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AS CHAIR STATEWIDE TRENDS AND STUDENT OUTCOMES AND NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC CAN ALSO IDENTIFY SUPPORTS THAT WE PROVIDED AT CC AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS I THOUGHT IT BEST IF WE START WITH THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE THE NEWS FOLKS ARE AWARE WE DID NOT HAVE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT RESULTS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR DUE TO THE SUSPENSION STATEWIDE TESTING IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S VALUE IN TAKING JUST A FEW MINUTES TAKE A QUICK LOOK BACK TO THE PRE CODE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR RESULTS ONCE ON THE DASHBOARD ALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE AT THAT TIME SHOWED SOME SMALL INCREASES IN PARTICULAR ON HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND BRIEFLY IN SOME TEST SCORERS YEAH IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM THE DATA WORSENED STATEWIDE TWELVE POINT ONE PERCENT OF STUDENTS TESTED IN OUR STATE YES MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE SCHOOL YEAR IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN THE RANGE WAS FROM FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT PRAIRIES MERICAN STUDENTS WERE CHRONICALLY ABSENT COMPARED TO TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM WAS AN ISSUE FOR US PRIOR AND FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC WE ANYONE OF SIGNIFICANCE CONCERNS AND OUR STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BE RE ENGAGED ONCE WERE ABLE TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS AT THAT TIME WERE DESIGNATED UNDER OUR STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM FOR WHAT WE CALL DIFFERENTIATING THE SYSTEMS SYSTEMS FELL TO THREE THIRTY THREE WHICH IS A FORTY PERCENT FEWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR DISQUALIFICATION JUST PROVIDES ELEAZAR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT MOSTLY THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES BUT ALSO THE SUPPORT OF THE C.

OR PRETREATED THE GRADE LEVEL ALL SCHOOLS AND OPEN IN NEW ORLEANS AFTER KATRINA NEED THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING PROCESS INDIVIDUAL READINESS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL BASIS STUDENTS TENDED TO TRICKLE BACK TO CAL NEW ORLEANS NEW ORLEANS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THEREFORE SCHOOLS COULD NEVER STOP ASSESSING ADJUSTING TO LEARNING LOSS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND OFTEN TOOK MULTIPLE YEARS DID INITIALIZE INTENTION TO RESOLVE THE LARGEST LEARNING GAPS SCHOOLS TRIED VARIOUS APPROACHES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT SCHOOL STRUGGLE TO KNOW HOW TO USE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE STUDENT READY THIS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS STUDENTS WHO ARE SCIENTISTS DISMISSED SPECIALLY DESIGNED TUTORING OR INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THEIR GRADE LEVEL INSTRUCTION OR ABLE TO ACCELERATE READING AND MATH LEVELS TEACHERS WHO WERE ABLE TO STAY WITH THEIR SAME STUDENTS FROM MORE THAN ONE YEAR MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS HIGH SCHOOLS FOUNDED STUDENTS OFTEN WERE BORED AND PURELY REMEDIAL CLASSES AND DID NOT MAKE PROGRESS AS WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY LEVEL STUDENTS STUDENTS WERE THEN ASSIGNED TO REGULAR GRADE LEVEL COURSES HIGH SCHOOLS INCLUDED ALL OF WHAT THEY CALL SPIRALING WHERE I TEACHERS WOULD PRESENT REGULAR COURSE MATERIAL AFTER WE TEACHING PRE REQUISITE MATERIALS AT SOME STUDENTS HAD MISSED OFTEN SHOW GAINES HIGH SCHOOLS ARRANGE FOR TUTORING FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED EXTRA HELP KEEPING UP INSPIRING COURSES CHAU GAINS AS WELL AND HIGH SCHOOLS FOUNDED SPIRALING GREATLY IMPROVES STUDENTS PERSISTENCE AT SCHOOL GRADUATION ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS EMPHASIZE MOSTLY SKILL RECOVERY THROUGH MEDIATION FOUNDED STUDENTS TEND TO SCORE POORLY IN STATE ACCOUNTABILITY TEST AND CONTINUE TO FALL BEHIND ON THE GRADE LEVEL CONTENT CONSEQUENT WE EMPHASIS ON GRADE LEVEL INSTRUCTION APPROVED SCORE PERFORMANCE MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT THEY FOUND TO TREAT IS THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE UNPREPARED FOR THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS STUDENTS IN THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR PATTERN HERE CAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS NOTED IN A RECENT GUIDANCE AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WERE GROWING CONCERN BEFORE THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ZONE EXASPERATED BECAUSE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AN INSTANCE OVERWHELMING AT THE PANDEMIC IS DELTA PARTICULARLY HARD CLOAK STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING INCREASING SOCIAL ISOLATION DISRUPTING ROUTINES AND A LIMITING SCHOOL TRADITIONS AND RITES OF PASSAGE WHILE ALSO REDUCING STUDENTS ACCESS TO SCHOOLS WHICH SERVE AS A DE FACTO MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ALSO FACING ECONOMIC KNOW THE CHALLENGES CRISIS STEEPER STILL ACCORDING TO THE CDC THE PROPORTION CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AMONG OUR PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS INCREASED COMPARED TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR SOME MENTAL HEALTH RELATED THIS IS FOR CHILDREN AGES FIVE ELEVEN AND TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY ONE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY A STUDENT SURVEY AND CONDUCTED BY THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS THE SPOT START OF THE PANDEMIC OWN RISING RATES OF ADOLESCENT STUDENTS REPORTED NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE CLIENT REPORTED WELLNESS FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT TO LESS THAN FORTY PERCENT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF STUDENTS WAITED TOO MANY MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS AND LEVEL REQUIRING IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION CONTINUED SUICIDES CONTINUE TO BE ON THE RISE THERE'S A REALLY STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT SUPPORT AND WE CAN PROVIDE FOR STUDENTS AND FOR THE EDUCATORS WHO SERVE THEM NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED FIRST ON STRATEGIES AND SUPPORTS TO RE ENGAGE STUDENTS TO SCHOOL WITH A FOCUS ON THEIR SOCIAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING TO ESTABLISH SETTINGS WITH THEIR ACADEMIC NEEDS CAN THAT BE MATT THIS WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INCLUDING SOCIAL WORKERS COUNSELORS NURSES AND OTHER EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN LEARNING ABOUT FIRST BEFORE WE DIVE DIRECTLY INTO ACADEMIC PROGRAMS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT OUR TEACHERS IN YOUR DOLLS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN WILL NEED TO RESOURCES FOR THEIR STUDENTS AS WELL AS THEMSELVES STARTING WITH THE TIME TO RE ENGAGE BEFORE JUMPING INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN NEXT SECTION WHEN I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THE CECE'S AND STUFF AND I'M -- AS MOST FOLKS IN THE IN MARCH AS ENDEMIC HERE WE RECESSED AT THAT TIME AND PIVOTED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THE FO'C'SLE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH CHILDREN AT THE ONSET WE REACHED OUT TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WILL DETERMINE THE MOST URGENT SUPPORTS FOR THE HIGH NEED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IDENTIFIED IN THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD THE COLLECTIVE GOAL WAS TO COLLABORATE AND RAPPER RESPONSE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS STUDENT AGENT ASSESS LEARNING PROGRESS EXPAND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING IN TRADES TRANSACTION FOR THE SAFE RETURN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FROM MARCH TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DAHLE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RESOURCES IN COLLABORATION WITH DELEGATES INCLUDING COUNTY OFFICES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS WELL AS OTHER AGENCIES AND OUR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT PARTNERS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND SAY WHAT AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE WE CREATED RESOURCES SUCH AS THE CONTINUITY OF LEARNING PLAY BOOKS WHICH FOCUS OUR RESOURCES SUPPORT DISTANCE LEARNING HARD READING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WE DEVELOPED A DISTANCE LEARNING CONSORTIUM FOR COUNTY OFFICES TO BUILD ONLINE LESSONS AND SUBJECT AREAS AND GRADE LEVELS INCLUDING LCL RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL BE CREATED XCELERATED LEARNING SERIES WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SOME OF OUR LOWEST PERFORMING ELEAZAR AND ALSO COUNTY OFFICE JUST HELP THEM AS THEY SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE OUR RECENTLY WE'VE DEVELOPED OUR FIELD GUIDE FOR ACCELERATED LEARNING EQUITY AND WELL BEING SUPPORT RALLY AS WITH MAXIMIZING EQUITY STRENGTHENING SYSTEMS INSTRUCTIONS AND LEVERAGING HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION THESE FREE ONLINE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED ACCESS BY TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND CLASSIFIED STATE WIDE LAST YEAR WE PUT ON TOLD THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT VIRTUAL SESSIONS OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS OVER THREE THOUSAND DELEGATES THAT PARTICIPATED WE CONTINUE ALSO REMAIN IN THE ON GOING DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE EMERGENCY PORTION RENTS ARE ELIGIBLE TO SUPPORT BASED ON THE STUDENT ARTS ON THE DASHBOARD THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER DURING A PANDEMIC OUR ONGOING SUPPORT IS INCLUDING YOUR DRESSING DISTANCE LEARNING STUDENT GROUP BEING SINGLE COGNITIVE LEARNING WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THOSE DISTRICTS LASTLY WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE HAVE LAUNCHED ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH WHAT WE CALL OUR LEADING FORWARD SERIES THIS IS AN INITIATIVE THAT PROVIDES TOOLS FOR EDUCATORS LEADERS AND SCHOOL COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS TO RE ENGAGE STUDENTS ACCELERATE LEARNING WELL DANCE IN EQUITY FOR OUR VULNERABLE STUDENT GROUPS ENSURING THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE WHOLE CHILD THE DESIGN OF THESE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING INITIATIVES BASED ON FIVE FOCUS AREAS FIRST DRIVING SOCIAL MOSTLY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES TOOLS AND SUPPORTS A THRIVING -- SOCIAL EMOTIONALLY AND ACADEMICALLY USE THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS ARE WE MEASURE STUDENT NEEDS IN PROGRESS TO ENSURE WE'RE SUPPORTING THE WHOLE CHILD EVERY DISTANCE LEARNING I'VE BEEN LEARNING AS WELL AS WE REAL SCHOOLS HOW DO WE CREATE RESPONSIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS WHAT'S CONSTRUCTION LOOK LIKE IN ORDER TO ENSURE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY STUDENT HOW DO WE SUPPORT SYSTEM LEADERSHIP ABOUT HIGHER DISTRICT LEVEL FROM OUR ROLES IS CLASSROOM RICHARD PETERS SCHOOL LEADERS PARENTS AND FAMILY YEARS TO TRULY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE CHILD TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ALL THIS IS DONE THROUGH ADVANCING ACCORDING TO MAINTAIN A FOCUS ON ADVANCING EQUITY FOR STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES TO DISCOURAGE OF CONTINUED TESTING CYBER LEARNING AS WE PREPARE FOR A RETURN TO SCHOOL AND JUST TWO WEEKS SINCE THE LAUNCH WE HAD OVER SIX THOUSAND IS VERY ACCESS THIS COLLECTION OF KEYNOTES COURSES TOOLS AND SESSIONS SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE GREAT AND SO CERTAIN CHANNELS LIKE YOU FOR RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY TRY TO SUPPORT STUDENTS I LEAVE YOU TODAY WITH THREE STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONSIDER FIRST SUPPORT DALY AS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT INCLUDE ACCESS TO RESEARCH AND TRAINING AND THAT ADOPTS A PHASED IN APPROACH TO RE ENGAGE STUDENTS THAT PRIORITIZES STUDENT SOCIAL HOLES MOTIONAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL SAFETY NEEDS FIRST CONDITION INCLUDE STRUCTURES RALLY IS TO FOCUS ON PAYER CONNECTIONS STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH TEACHERS AND DEEPLY ENGAGE WITH THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WILL SPENT THE LAST YEAR CO TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME THEY ALSO INVEST IN TRAINING TO SUPPORT ACCELERATION INTO YOUR SUPPORT TO ALLOW STUDENTS ACCESS GRADE LEVEL CURRICULUM ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS NEEDED TO ACCELERATE THEIR LEAD LEARNING WITH A LESSER LINES ON WOULD BE THE ASIAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE I ALSO HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF MY COLLEAGUES COLORS STRADA DISTRIBUTION YOUR AVAILABLE AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK THAT WAS A PRETTY THOROUGH EXAMINATION CURRENT STATE OF ONLINE EDUCATION STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRETTY ACCURATE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I THINK IN IN THE WORDS OF MY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ONLINE LEARNING SUCKS RIGHT -- STUDENTS ARE NOT ENGAGED STUDENTS ARE NOT PERFORMING WELL ACADEMICALLY AND WHAT'S UNUSUAL -- GIVEN OUR HISTORY OUR DATA IT IS NOT JUST ANY LONGER THOSE STUDENTS THAT FALL UNDER A SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS RIGHT THE TIME ONCE YOU IS RIGHT TYPICALLY WE KNOW THAT THOSE STUDENTS COME WITH MORE CHALLENGES BUT TODAY IT IS A LOT MORE STUDENTS THAN YESTERDAY SO -- THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF LEARNING RECAPTURE LEARNING LOSS EVERYONE CALLED RUNNING OF IT TURNER LEARNING OR CAPTURE IS A TERM PRETTY SOON -- BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND -- THE UNDERSCORES WELL WAS THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE SITUATION WHEN I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER YOU KNOW I'M HEARING IT

C. H. L. A. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES BECAUSE OF THESE HEADACHES NEXT COMMENT I TEACH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SCV THE STATE SCHOOLS CLOSE ARE HURTING ALL STUDENTS THEY NEED SOCIAL INTERACTION IN PERSON EDUCATION DAILY STRUCTURE THIS HAS TO STOP NEXT COMMENT CHILD DEPRESSED NO SOCIAL LIFE NO SPORTS NEXT COMMENT MY SON'S PERSONALITY HAS CHANGED FIFTH GRADER HE HAS LOST HIS CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL AND HATE SCHOOL MY NINTH GRADER HAS NO HOPE OF GOING BACK AND AT THIS POINT THEY JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY SOCCER IN HIGH SCHOOL MY ONCE HAPPY EAGER LEARNER HAS TURNED INTO A TEARFUL ON MOTIVATED GRUMPY KID WHO DRIED SCHOOL EACH DAY IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO WATCH OUR HEARTS ARE ALL BREAKING FOR STUDENTS AT THIS VERY MOMENT AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BUT THESE ARE GOING TO BE SOME LONG TERM NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE TO ADDRESS FOR FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO MY QUESTIONS THIRTY TO MOTIONAL HERE I HEARD FROM MY COMMUNITY WHICH ASPECTS OF DISTANCE LEARNING HAVE BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE AND SUPPORTING ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS AND WHICH HAVE BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING THIS IS HEATHER HOUSEHOLD ALL JUMP IN FIRST WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH OVER IT SINCE ESSENTIALLY THE PANDEMIC AND MARCH TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE RESEARCH BASE BEHIND THIS QUESTION WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING WORK FOR KIDS KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT IDEAL AND IT CAN'T BE IDEAL BUT A LOT OF WHAT MAKES DISTANCE LEARNING WORK FOR CHILDREN IT'S A LOT OF WHAT MAKES IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BURKE FOR CHILDREN TOO IT'S THE MORE THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE WORK THE MORE THAT STUDENTS CAN GET FEEDBACK FROM THEIR TEACHER THE MORE THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH PEERS ON ISSUES OF LEARNED SO WHEN DISTANCE LEARNING WORKS FOR KIDS IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A STRUCTURE IN WHICH THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING SMALL GROUP WORK WHO ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW THEY WERE ENGAGED BEFORE BUT I THINK THE FACT TO THAT IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T A GOOD ANALOG FOR IN DISTANCE LEARNING THANK -- PHYSICAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS RIGHT IT'S IT'S REALLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN'T DO A SOCCER GAME ON SECOND -- THERE ARE LOTS OF SCIENCE EVENTS FOR COLLABORATIVE WORK IT REALLY IS DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE AND ARE NOT SETTING SO AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW I I SPOKE IN MY TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW EVEN ACCESSING THINGS LIKE SMALL GROUP WORK AND COLLABORATIVE TIME OFTEN REQUIRE INTERNADO AT HOME YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT IS READY AND ENGAGED IN LEARNING AND THAT CAN BE A HUGE BARRIER -- BUT BUT TYPICALLY THAT I THINK WOULD BE WHAT MAKES DISTANCE LEARNING COULD A PERSON WHAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU I WILL I WOULD JUST ADD TO I THINK AND I THINK OTHER RELATED STRONG ENGAGEMENT IS ALWAYS THE KEY RIGHTS CHILDREN HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THEIR LEARNING BUT IN ORDER TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN REALLY PARTICIPATE AND THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE TO FOCUS DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE SOME AMAZING EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT OR REALLY STRATEGIC IN A REALLY FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PUT KIDS INTO YOUR VARIOUS -- BREAKOUT GROUPS IN PARTICULAR GIVING THEM SOME PROJECTS TO DO OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE THE PEACE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS FOLKS ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO KIDS DIRECTLY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE BABY MORE SUPPORTS IN TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE WORKING SPECIFICALLY STRATEGIES IDEAS SO THEY CAN COLLECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER BY HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THE STUDENT OUR HISTORY LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT THE NORM THANKS BYE AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL STRUGGLE WHERE THOSE EXAMPLES OF BEEN ABLE TO HELP AND I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE SUCCESS AND OBVIOUSLY WE FOR THE OLDER STUDENTS AND I SAY THE STUDENTS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL ANGLER I AM A SENIOR AT HOME BUT IT WAS FAIRLY DISENGAGED BUT SHE'S COMES NOT REALLY GOOD AT HOME AND SHE'S SHE'S DOING FINE BUT SHE'S NOT BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY ENGAGED IN SCHOOL I'M PARTICULAR BUT SHE'S BEEN OKAY SHE'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT SHE'S GONNA BE OK AND BE ABLE TO GO ON SCHOOL RIGHT WERE IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE TANK TYPE SPORTS WHICH WE KNOW EXIST FOR A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THANK YOU AND ONE MORE QUESTION WHAT POLICY JUST SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE AROUND REGRESSION FOR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS WE TALK ABOUT LEARNING LOSS WHICH IS WHICH IS EVIDENT -- BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE SICK THERE IS SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION AND OUR CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM ON A CHILDREN WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND DISABILITIES -- WHAT ARE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE END OF ANY DATA POINTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO ADD TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE HELLO THIS IS CARLA ESTRADA WITH THE CCD ONE SUGGESTION AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC IS TO REALLY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO START IDENTIFYING WHO THOSE STUDENTS ARE WHAT SERVICES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WHAT HAS NOT AND AS AS MR MOLINO HAS SHARED ALSO REACHING OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND WHERE ARE THE AREAS THEY SEE THEIR CHILDREN REGRESSING OR WHERE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN REGRESSED REGRESSION WE HAVE SEEN SOME STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO VERY WELL WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF STRUCTURES OF DISTANCE LEARNING BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF KIDS WHO HAVE NOT SO I THINK BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE WHERE THE NEEDS ARE SO PLANNING AND SUPPORTS CAN START OCCURRING NOW IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO DO THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH CD EVEN OTHER TO UNDERSTAND HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO HELP THEM PROBLEM SOLVE ESPECIALLY OUR MOST HIGHEST NEEDS STUDENTS -- DURING DISTANCE LEARNING HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT ANOTHER AREA FOR OUR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IS ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS AND THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT OF PROVIDERS AND HOW ARE THEY WORKING TOGETHER AND THERE'S BEEN SOME BRIGHT SPOTS THAT WE'VE SEEN WHERE WHEN THOSE WRAPAROUND TEAMS COME TOGETHER AND REALLY PROBLEM SOLVE WHAT IS WORKING FOR THESE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE A GREATER SUCCESS OF BEING ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND SO REALLY BEING ABLE TO BRING THOSE PROVIDERS TOGETHER SO THAT WAY THEY CAN WORK AROUND BEING ABLE TO TO YOUR SUPPORT REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE INTEGRATING THEIR SUPPORT IN THE GENERAL EDUCATION EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG KIDS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLICK OKAY SEEING THAT NUMBER QUESTIONS HERE I I DID HAVE HAVE SOME BUT I I THINK WE'LL JUST MOVE ON BUT NOTE THAT -- THE POINTS THAT YOU REYES ARE EXACTLY THE POINTS THAT I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY IS TRYING TO INCLUDE IN OUR RE OPENING PLANTS ESPECIALLY WE WE DEAL WITH WITH LEARNING LOST REALIZING THAT IS GOING TO BE AN ON GOING ASSESS SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO ONLY HEAR

AGAIN AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL BE PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE PROVISIONS AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT -- AS WELL AS BE ACCOMPANIED TRAILER BILL AND DISTANCE LEARNING IS DEFINED IN STATUTE AS -- IN OUR INSTRUCTION IN WHICH THE STUDENT AND INSTRUCTOR ARE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS -- THAT WAS IT AND THEIR GENERAL DEFINITION SAME COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR OVER THE SUMMER AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA BUT TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT -- EXPRESSED THE INTENT BUT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WHILE ALSO ALLOWING THEM TO OFFER THIS DISTANCE LEARNING OPTION AND OR HYBRID MODELS OF LEARNING UNDER CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR THE AGENDA -- DOESN'T I STRUGGLE PLAYING OUT A LOT OF THE PROVISIONS AND HE COMPLIMENTS AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING AND THOSE CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES THREE AND FOUR -- ALSO ON PAGE FOUR THE AGENDA LAYS OUT SEVERAL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE AIMED AT ENSURING THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE MAINTAINING REGULAR CONTACT WITH STUDENTS FOR PARTICIPATING AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL NOT REITERATE THOSE PERFECT PROVISIONS BUT AGAIN HE JUST GREEN PARTY AGENDA ASSEMBLY THOSE OUT SINCE THESE DISTANCE LEARNING PROVISIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE THIS PAST SUMMER BINANCE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION LEGISLATIVE STAFF FROM BOTH HOUSES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE -- IN ORDER TO BETTER ASSIST IN DEVELOPED GUIDANCE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WHO ARE ADAPTING TO THIS DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL BE FOUND ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE IN THE FORM OF AND I THINK USE IN ADDITION TO THAT DISTANCE LEARNING STATUTES THEMSELVES BUT TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTANCE LEARNING CURRICULUM GUIDANCE THAT'S BASED ON THE STATE'S COMMON CORE STANDARDS IN MATH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION -- HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK AND THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE SOCIETY FOR TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION EXPERTS AT BOTH STANFORD IN THE CSU SYSTEM TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THAT'LL HELP TEACHERS IMPROVE REMOTE LEARNING AND LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY -- THIS DISTANCE LEARNING CURRICULUM GUIDANCE IS EXPECTED TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD AND BY THAT BY THE MAIN BOARD MEETING ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE BEEN FACING I'M PARTICULARLY OVER THIS PAST YEAR WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE THROUGH OUR SPRING PROCESS AND CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AROUND AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND WHAT SCHOOL MAY LOOK LIKE IN THE FALL WHEN WE RE OPEN I'M FOR THAT MODEL I HAVE WITH ME AND MY COLLEAGUE ERIN FOR RADIO -- ALSO REMOTE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER AND ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NOW OR IF IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAT IS FINE THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU WE CAN PROCEED TO L. L. AND WE CAN COME BACK TO THE DIFFERENT OTHER FINANCE REPRESENT IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS IN THE LEAD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO ALTHOUGH THE BUDGET ASKING THE SCHOOL WHO RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR AND DOES NOT EXTEND PROVISIONS RELATED TO DISTANCE LEARNING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER ALLOWING DISTANCE LEARNING UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY STILL BE WARRANTED OUR OFFICE DOESN'T HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE DO HAVE SOME KEY QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ON THIS ISSUE GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES OVER HOW THAT PANDEMIC NAY PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ME WANTS TO INCLUDE CONTINGENCIES THAT ALLOW FOR DISTANCE LEARNING UNDER SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR INSTANCE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ALLOW STUDENTS OR FAMILIES WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS MAY BE PARTICULARLY AT RISK FOR KOBE NINETEEN TO HAVE THE OPTION OF CONTINUING UNDER DISTANCE LEARNING ALTERNATIVELY THESE POSSIBILITIES MAY ASSIST THE STATE IN RESPONDING TO MORE LONG STANDING CHALLENGES RELATED TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES OR EARTHQUAKES RATHER THAN AFFECTED STUDENTS LOSING THE REMAINDER OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WHEN A NATURAL DISASTER OCCURS WHICH OFTENTIMES HAPPENS THE STUDENT COULD INSTEAD CONTINUE TO ACCESS EDUCATION THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING WELL THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE AND REBELS SECONDLY IF SOME FORM OF REMOTE LEARNING FORTY CONTINUE THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO DISTANCE LEARNING AN INDEPENDENT STUDY TO BETTER SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING THIS WOULD ENTAIL REVISITING THEIR REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND EVALUATING WHETHER SUCH REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE EXTENDED MODIFIED OR ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AND THEN CONSIDERING WHETHER ANY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE ON THIS NOTE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER DISTANCE LEARNING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT FOR A SCHOOL DASHBOARD FOR KOBE NINETEEN AND HIS EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THE LEGISLATURE ME ONE INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET TO ENSURE INSTRUCTION IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE PERFECT TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GOOD EVENING ALLEN GARNER ON THE HAVE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION IT NOT SPEAK STERNER CHALLENGES STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS HAVE FACED AND CONTINUE TO FACE IN DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF TECTONIC SHIFT IN THE WAY EDUCATION OUR OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND MUCH OF WHAT WE FACE THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN REALLY TRULY UNCHARTED TERRITORY THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WHEN HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY IT'S UNSAFE FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO TAP IN PERSON INSTRUCTION DISTANCE LEARNING HAS PROVIDED THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO OUR STUDENTS BUT THIS TRANSITION HAS HAD ITS CHALLENGES LET'S BASIC SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE TAUGHT THIS WAY WE ARE WORKING ON GETTING DEVICES FOR OUR SIX POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS TO SUPPORT AND TRAIN TEACHERS TO TEACH IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS ENGAGED AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE MENTAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO GET THEM THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC DISTANCE LEARNING WILL LIKELY BE WITH US IN SOME FORM MOVING FORWARD EVEN AS SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO REOPEN IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES WE'VE SEEN EACH COMMITTED TO OFFERING REAL TIME ACTIONABLE SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS AS WE LEAN INTO THIS NEW REALITY AS APARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA ARE DISCUSSED THE STANDARDS AND THE STORY FOR DISTANCE LEARNING WILL SUNSET IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ABSENT A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE THE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME LAWS AND STATUTES THAT GOVERN GOVERNMENT DEGENERATION OF ATTENDANCE PROPORTIONATE EXISTED PRIOR TO COVER NINETEEN WILL BE BACK IN A FACT BASED ON CURRENT LAW ALL AT LEAST NEED TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONAL TIME AND ATTENDANCE ACCOUNTING ONCE IN PLACE PRIOR TO DISTANCE LEARNING ABSENT A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE THE DISTANCE LEARNING ANNOUNCES THAT WERE THAT WERE CREATED WILL EXPIRE AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS ALL STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST BE OFFERED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT MEETS CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THIS INCLUDES THE ANNUAL MINUTE REQUIREMENT THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF SCHOOL THE REQUIREMENT AND THE MINIMUM DAY REQUIREMENT STUDENTS MUST BE SCHEDULED FOR THE MINIMUM DAY AND TO THE EXTENT TO DISTRICT OFFERS INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS CAN OPT TO PARTICIPATE IN INDEPENDENCE ATTY ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ATTENDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT IS LIKELY THAT TEAMS WOULD NEED TO BE MADE TO THE LINE TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM FEASIBLE ON A DISTRICT OR STUDENTS MIGHT BE SAYS THEY'RE ALSO NOTES ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND CO USE AS FAR AS THEIR REQUIREMENTS FOR SPORT IN PERSON LEARNING THAT WILL BE REINSTATED START TO START ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTIONS TO A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY IF IT IS UNABLE TO THE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME REQUIREMENTS OR EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LAST ATTENDANCE DUE TO AN EMERGENCY WHILE THESE UNLOCK LAS INSURANCE ONLY A WILL BE HELD HARMLESS DUE TO ANY FUNDING LOSS DUE TO SCHOOL CLOSURE

INSTRUCTION AND MEASUREMENT BRANCH CVT FOR PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS AND WANTING TO CANCEL WHO IS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR CURRENT SCHOOL PHYSICAL SERVICE DIVISION TO ANSWER ANY FISCAL QUESTIONS ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING QUESTIONS MISTER DONNA YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE THAT THERE MAY BE A PLACE WILL THERE IS A PLACE GOING FORWARD FOR SOME ONLINE LEARNING I THINK ON A VERY LIMITED BASIS FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO FIND SUCCESS WITH ONLINE LEARNING I THINK IT'S BEEN MINIMAL THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK AGAIN THERE IS A PLACE BOB BUT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE WITH NO ETHICS NO DESIRE TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS YET A DESIRE TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE THAT HAVE GONE IN TO THE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL BUSINESS MADE TONS OF MONEY AND NOT SERVE STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU TO REFORM IT IS TO BE SIGNIFICANT REFORM WITH THE -- THE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL VENTURES THAT WE NOW HAVE AN ANY THAT MAY COME FORWARD AFTER THE MORATORIUM IN WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONLY AS TO TO ENTER THIS VENTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY BETTER PREPARED ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY SIDE THAN SOMEONE WHO JUST OPENED UP A SCHOOL OVERNIGHT SAYS GUESS WHAT I AM PUTS ONLINE AND -- MY COMMIT FRAUD MIGHT NOT THE WAVE JUST YOU KNOW GOOGLE YAHOO IT IT'LL COME UP -- HOW MANY CASES THERE HAVE BEEN A FRAUD OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NOT SERVE STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN I'M LOOKING FOR THIS INCIDENT SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS -- IS A PRIORITY WHEN WITH ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS GOING FORWARD BE THE CHARTER OR NOT QUITE FRANKLY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THERE MAY BE A PLACE FOR THIS TYPE OF LEARNING AND AND AND YOU KNOW I DO RECOGNIZE THAT BUT AGAIN THERE'S A HARLEY THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT REFORM WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CURRENTLY PERFORMANCE OR THAT SEEK TO DO IT IN THE FUTURE OF ANY TYPE WITH THAT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION BUT I'LL JUST NOTE YOU KNOW WE PASSED A LAW -- THAT WE YOU AND I WORKED ON TOGETHER WHICH IS OUTLAWED -- THESE FOR PROFIT -- ONLINE -- CHARTERS BUT YOU WERE G. OF BILKING TAXPAYERS AND HAD MASSIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FRAUDULENT PRACTICES -- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHERS WHO ARE NOT FOR PROFIT THEY COULD GET IN THIS BUSINESS SO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT FRONT AS WELL SO THERE IS A PLACE FOR FOR ONLINE I THINK WE'VE LEARNED THAT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WE HAVE OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW GOD FORBID THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WERE ICED OVER LIKE WE SEE IT IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW WITH THOSE STUDENTS ARE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A WEEK OR MORE AND HAVING THAT ONLINE DISTANCE I THINK IS VALUABLE IN THE FACT WE HAVE HAD A NATURAL DISASTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO LEARN SO WITH THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I KNOW THERE ARE IN THE CHEN ALREADY BUT ALL AT ALASKA EITHER EDUCATION OR ANYBODY ELSE AS FAR AS -- WE WENT THROUGH THIS THE PAST ROUGHLY YEAR AND SO WE DID HAVE THESE DISTANCE LEARNING STANDARDS AND POLICIES SO WHICH ONES DO WE THINK NEED CLARIFICATION -- STRENGTHENING IN THE NEXT YEAR OR FRANKLY HAVING DISTANCE LEARNING PLANS REGARDLESS OF CLUB IN NINETEEN SO LET'S START WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- MISTER CHAIR -- AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I KNOW -- AND STATED IN MY OPENING REMARKS -- AFTER THAT LANGUAGE WAS RELEASED LAST SUMMER AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING WE DID GO THROUGH A PROCESS AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND LEGISLATIVE STOP IN STATE COURT WHERE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE COMING IN FROM THE FIELD AND TRYING TO -- PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE AND GET AHEAD OF -- YOU KNOW SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE BE STEMMING -- AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING PROVISIONS THAT WE WILL OFFER A SIMILAR PROCESS RECOGNIZING THAT DISTANCE LEARNING -- IN THE YOU KNOW IN RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC ON MAY BE DIFFERENT -- THEN THE DISTANCE LEARNING WE'RE ENVISIONING AROUND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO WILDFIRE OR OTHER EMERGENCIES THAT MAY MAY NOT BE QUITE AS LONG TERM -- I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS -- ANY ANY MORE INSIGHTS TO PROVIDE BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE OUR COMMENTS ON THE QUESTION DOES THE L.

CARE STATE PRESCHOOL THE BEST OPTION TO EXPAND REALLY DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS FOR EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO OFFER WHEN YOU'RE A PUBLIC PRESCHOOL TO ALL STUDENTS THEN HE COULD BE A BETTER PATH TO EXPANSION THE STATE COULD YOU SCHOOL DISTRICT CATCHMENT AREAS AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN WILL HAVE ACCESS TO TO KEEP PROGRAM IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO OFFER PRESCHOOL TO THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES THEN THIS A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM COULD BE ABOUT A PATH TO EXPANSION TO PRESCHOOL ALREADY SERVES A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE SECOND WE KNOW THAT HE CAN EXPANSION REQUIRED ONGOING FUNDING WELL THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING TIME COSTS OF JUST DISABILITY CONSTRUCTION UPDATE THEIR ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SUCH AS HIRING ADDITIONAL TEACHERS THIRD WE ESTIMATE THE STATE COULD SUSTAIN ONGOING COSTS OF EXPANDING TKA WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPECIFICALLY WERE REFERRING TO IF THE STATE ALLOWED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GENERATE A FULL YEAR OF ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING FOR CHILDREN WITH FOR DAYS AFTER DECEMBER SECOND HOWEVER WE WOULD DO THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MAKE MAJOR ONGOING PROGRAMMATIC CAPABLE OF MUTATIONS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS LASTLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT T. HE EXPANSION IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD HAVE A SIZEABLE IMPACT ON STATE PRESCHOOL GOLDMINT ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM CONSERVE YOUNGER STUDENTS ROUGHLY SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE FOR YOUR WAS FOUR YEARS OLD CLARIFYING THE ROLE OF THE PRESCHOOL WOULD ENSURE THE STATE'S EXISTING PROGRAMS OPERATE IN ALIGNMENT TO BEST SERVE CHILDREN OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THANK YOU HONORING THE HAVE THE STATE'S DIFFERENT HAS THE PUBLIC INSPECTION CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE S. S. P. I FULLY SUPPORT THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IN BOTH FACILITIES AND TEACHER TRAINING WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME IS THERE ANOTHER MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT STV'S MEDICINAL COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE NEVER MARK AND DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TURNING THURMAN'S BEFORE GIVING HER COMMENTS ON THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WITHIN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR T. K. I WANTED TO START BY JUST A FEW KEY OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT ARE STATE PRESCHOOL SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE BOTH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH WAS MENTIONED AS WELL AS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OBERNOLTE CASERT JUST OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND WHERE THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REGULAR TWO K. WITH BIRTHDAYS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER SECOND AND DECEMBER SECOND AND NEARLY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WHO ACCESSED THE EARLY ADMITTANCE R. ET QUE WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE BIRTHDAYS BETWEEN DECEMBER SECOND AND THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR APPROXIMATELY FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE SERVED IN TWO K. QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS IT CAN'T HURT TO SHOW THE OTHER SIDE INSKEEP PETE STARK ROUGHLY A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE BEING BROWN AND THREE YEAR OLDS AND SEVENTY ONE PERCENT THAT SB SIX THOUSAND BEING FOR AND REDUCED MEALS OVER EIGHTY PERCENT ARE FROM FAMILIES WITH INCOMES BELOW THE GREEN RETAIN THIS PRICE NOW SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO OFFER EACH U. K. TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE THOSE BIRTHDAYS BETWEEN DECEMBER SECOND AND THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR BUT THEY ONLY RECEIVED FINES AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN AFTER THEY TURN FIVE THERE ALSO IS A PROVISIONAL LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR NEXT YES K. STERN'S WHICH ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO SERVE CHILDREN IN S. YES HE ENTERED THEIR FIFTH BIRTHDAY AND THEN THEY TRANSITION TO T. K. SO THAT BASICALLY THE CLASSROOM HAS LAYERED FUNDING WITHOUT MINE I'M GONNA DIVE INTO THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE INCENTIVE GRANT BUT DISTRICTS TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR EACH U. K. OVERALL BUSINESS GARNER SHARED WE ARE REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE GARDEN PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SUPPORTING US WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH THAT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IMPROVING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES ADDRESSING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC INEQUALITIES AND RACIAL DISPARITIES WE ARE ALSO PLEASED TO SEE THE PARTY FORGET THE GUESTS AND SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT EXPAND ACCESS OR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS FULL DAY PROGRAMS INCLUSIVE PROGRAM SO THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES OUR IN THE SCENE ASTROS SETTING AS THEIR PEERS AND AREAS WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DISPROPORTIONATELY PARTICULAR RACES OR ETHNICITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD REALLY WANNA ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ALIGNING WITH THE MASTER PLAN'S RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND HAVING A STRONG MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES THE STP IN PARTICULAR WE LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND ADDRESS HE CAN'T QUALITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE TEACHER CHILD RATIOS IN CLASS SIZE AND ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILD OBSERVATIONAL ASSESSMENT WE ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR THREE YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT THEIR THOSE INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS AS WE MOVE INTO THE FIFTEEN MILLION OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEEKAY AND KEEP TEACHERS WE ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT KNOWING THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS IS CRITICAL AND THAT THE LEARNING THIRTY KM K¿T JURORS IS IMPORTANT AS THEY ADDRESS THOSE YOUNGEST LEARNERS AS THEY CAN AND UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES AND PROGRESSION OF LEARNING IS CRITICAL AS WELL AS PROVIDING FULL INCLUSION AND SUPPORTING DOING LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND AFTER THIS PANDEMIC DEEPLY SUPPORTING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICE AS AS WE LOOK AT THE G. CARE REQUIREMENTS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION IN THIS PROJECT THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN STATUTE HE K. TEACHER REQUIREMENTS NEEDS TO BE REEXAMINED IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT MASTER PLAN AND APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO ALLOW THESE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN OTHER KEY PIECES ABOUT THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION LOOKING AT IT'S SOMETHING AROUND ENSURING THAT THE WORKFORCE IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE EVEN YOUNGER EACH GREAT BRITAIN THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF THE MASTER PLANNER AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESCHOOL THROUGH THIRD GRADE ALIGNMENT WE THINK THAT THIRTY MILLION TAKES IMPORTANT STEPS TO ADDRESS THAT THAT COULD GO FURTHER ST SUPPORTING ALIGNMENT IN KIJIJI ACROSS THE S. B. P. T. K. AND K. AND REALLY EATEN CERTAIN NOT BURKE B. K. YOUR YOUR SIESTA KEY ANTI K. TEACHERS ACCESS THAT MANY I MEAN WE APPRECIATE THAT TWO HUNDRED NINETY PRETTY CAMPUS STUDIES IN THIS BUDGET SINCE THE SAUDIS ARE KEY COMPONENT TO ADDRESS ANY EXTENSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT'S RIGHT TO ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ALL ARE START OFFER NO SOME OF OUR MEMBERS CERTAINLY HAVE QUESTIONS HERE SO I WANNA I WANNA FOCUS THIS ON -- I'M KIND OF LIKE FOUR BUCKETS HERE FIRST IS THE OVERALL -- ADDITION -- TO WOULD BE SOME TYPE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE IN THE CURRENT KIND OF FRAMEWORK THIS THIS THE STANDARDS IN AND -- POLICIES FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND FOURTH IS THE THE BIG PIECES MONEY -- IN THE FUNDING SO I GUESS THAT THE FIRST THING IS THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT WE'VE ALL COME TO THE CONCLUSION DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS THAT EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS AND THAT PRE K. MATTERS AND READILY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S NOT JUST FOUR YEAR OLDS YOU'RE NOT JUST BORN AT THE AGE OF FOUR HE CAN ENTER KINDERGARTEN NEXT YEAR BUT ZERO THROUGH FIVE COMPONENT BUT WE'VE ALL -- CAME THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT ONE YEAR OF HIGH QUALITY PRE K. REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE -- FOR FOR KINDERGARTEN READINESS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS -- BUT MORE THAN ONE YEAR MULTIPLE YEARS AND IN TWO YEARS WOULD MAKE AN EVEN BIGGER DIFFERENCE AND SO -- THAT'S THE ONE THE FIRST EXAM WANNA GET AS WITH THE L. A. L. ASKED IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND IS NOTED WE SPEND ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR THREE CD HE TO SUBSIDIZE -- FOUR YEAR OLDS TO PARK LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SO IF ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE IN THE L. E. A. BASED TEEKAY THE PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH WE'LL GET TO A LITTLE BIT THE FUNDING OF THAT -- YOU HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS IT CERTAINLY WE COULD EXPAND ACCESS FOR ZERO THREE THREE SO THE SAME -- PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CONSERVE MORE THREE YEAR OLDS AND WE CAN SERVE MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT JUST FROM THAT THE CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE IF YOU BELIEVE THAT EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS IF YOU ARE A LOW INCOME AND KID IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU GET TWO YEARS OF FREE PUBLICLY FUNDED HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE MAKER AS WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS OUR STUBBORN -- YOU KNOW ACHIEVEMENT OPPORTUNITY GAP AS KIDS INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT'S THE ROUTE THAT WE OUGHT TO GO CERTAINLY THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL HERE ON THE ONE TIME SIDE THERE ARE COMPANION BILLS IN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY MORALIZING THIS THIS KIND OF VISION SO -- THAT BEING SAID THE OVERALL VISION AS FAR AS WHAT WE DO -- NOW AS YOU NOTED THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE IN LOS ANGELES -- THAT THAT DO THIS -- EXTENDED TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND HAVE KIDS ENTER BEFORE THEY THEY TURN FIVE AND THEN THEY'RE NOT FUNDED AND THEN THEY THEY GET EIGHTY EIGHT ONCE THE KID TURNS FIVE -- AND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER SOME HAVE THESE MIX SYSTEMS LIKE SAN DIEGO SO I GUESS THE GOOD THAT THE QUESTION HERE ALL ASPECTS OF THE MY ONE QUESTION HERE ON THIS ONE IS DO WE WANT TO ALLOW DISTRICTS -- NOW TO BE MORE -- ENTREPRENEURIAL IN AND ALLOW THEM TO START COLLECTING -- EIGHTY EIGHT RIGHT AWAY IN THIS NEXT YEAR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THAT FOR EXAMPLE F. L. A. STAR THIS -- ON JULY ONE WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BE OPEN TO ALLOWING THEM TO GET EIGHTY EIGHT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR NOT JUST ONCE THIS MONTH THE STUDENT TURNS FIVE THIS IS SERRA BURDEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THAT PARTICULAR FEATURE OF OF EXPANDING THE PROGRAM AND THAT WAY IT'S ALL PART OF OUR PROPOSAL -- I KNOW THERE'S LARGER CONSIDERATIONS IN TERMS OF EXPANDING ADA IN THAT REGARD -- I WOULD HIT IT OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE READY TO SEE IF YOU HAD ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THAT ISSUE GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES ALRIGHT ERIN RADIANCE BARBARA FINANCED THAT I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OFFICIAL POSITION ON ON SUCH A FRAMEWORK AS YOU LAID OUT I THINK I WOULD POINT OUT THOUGH -- BUT THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW YOU THINK PROBABLY NEED ONE TIME BONDS -- THAT REALLY ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE CAN WE CAN PUT TOWARDS HEALTHIER FAT BY THE DANCE CURRENTLY TOWARDS ALL OF OUR OTHER PROPOSALS LIKE ARE NOT SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION GRANTS IT CETERA BY HAVING THIS BE ONE TIED TO ACCEPT THAT WE ALLOW EIGHT EIGHT INCREASE THEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO REDUCE SOME OTHER PROPOSAL AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE THOUGHT MADE THE MOST SENSE AND WAS THE MOST PRUDENT IN OUR POWER APPROACH FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- BUT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE THE CONVERSATION IT'S A VERY THERE DOES A LOT OF COMPETING PRIORITIES OUT THERE FOR ELLIE EIGHT AND AND ADA CERTAINLY IS ONE OF THE SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT OKAY THANK YOU I'M ON THAT JUST THAT JUST A COMMENT THAT I I THINK THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ONE TIME MONEY FOR DISTRICTS TO -- KENNETH SPRING INTO THIS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT ALLOWING THEM TO GET CAUGHT PROPERLY COMPENSATED I KNOW THAT SOME DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY ASKED YOU KNOW WOULD WE BE OPEN TO THAT AND I DOES NOT YOUR PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THAT WE WOULD PUT FORWARD IN OUR AND OUR FINAL BUDGET HERE TO ALLOW DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO START NOW TIP TO COLLECT AT EIGHTY EIGHT -- A YEAR ROUND -- AS FAR AS THE THAT THE STANDARDS I KNOW -- WE HAVE SEPARATE LEGISLATION OUT THERE BUT BEFORE US IS IS THE PROPOSAL TODAY AS FAR AS -- THIS PROPOSAL ON THE GOVERNOR'S MASTER PLAN AND THIS THESE QUALITY STANDARDS THE RATIOS AND SO FORTH DOES -- CITY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT NOW BEFORE WE EXPAND OR ALL THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO PART OF WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING AN INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM IS PHASED OUT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS WE DON'T THINK SHORT TERM THIS WILL HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON TO THE STANDARDS THAT NEED TO BE A LOT AND AS OF NOW HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT'S OUTLINED IN THE MASTER PLAN -- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A LONGER TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS THE THE NEEDS OF AN EXPANDED TKA PROGRAMMER PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL OKAY THE CD II WANT TO ADDRESS THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS AS FAR AS STANDARDS AND RATIOS DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT NOW AS WE PUT MONEY AND FOR -- ONE TIME SUPPORT TO EXPAND TO GET SICK WE HAVE SARAH NOBLE MORGAN ADDRESS THAT SIR I THINK YOU CHAIR THEY'RE NOT WILL BARGAIN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO START ADDRESSING IT NOW SO THAT WE DON'T EXPAND UTK SO FAR WITHOUT GETTING THOSE STANDARDS IN PLACE WE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME TEACHERS THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY EIGHT KIDS IN A CLASSROOM IN JUST ONE TEACHER THAT THEY GET PRETTY STRETCHED AND AS YOU LOOK AT HAVING YOUNGER AND YOUNGER FORCED TO REALLY ARE PRESCHOOL AGE THAT THEY WOULD NEED THAT RENT MULTIPLE TEACHERS IN THAT GREAT SIZE REDUCED WE HAVE THE BEST SUPPORT EVERY CHILD DEVELOPMENT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE REALLY ADDRESSING THE LEARNING STANDARDS AND ENSURING THAT IT IS A PRESCHOOL BASED ON THE RISK OF ANIMATIONS AS YOU DO YOU THINK ET K. PERSONS TO CARRY YES THAT COULD OCCUR ONE HUNDRED PERCENT -- I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING A TEACHER IN GENERAL FOR A FIRST GRADE OR KINDERGARTEN WITH THIRTY KIDS BUT -- I TEACH A CLASS ROOM WITH THAT MANY IN ONE ADULT I THINK JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO -- I'M NOT TRYING TO MIX HERE OUR POLICY PROPOSALS AND AND THE BUDGET BUT HAVING YOU KNOW THE THE THE TWO ADULTS IN THE CLASSROOM AND THE SMALLER RATIOS I THINK YOU KNOW MAKES SENSE FOR THESE EARLY GRADES LASTLY I WANTED TO GO TO THIS TO THIS POINT THAT -- THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA AND ELADIO -- THAT HAVE HAD HAD TALKED ABOUT AND SO WE HAVE MISTER COUPON ON THE FROM L. L. C. THEIR JUST SARAH CORTEZ NUMBER SEVERAL DALY I CAN ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC COMPANIES THE REQUESTED YEAH YEAH SO I MISTER COUPON OR OR OR YOU MISTER CABRAL TALKED ABOUT THE INTERPLAY WITH -- PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THIS RAINY DAY FUND AND THE EXPANSION OF T. K. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A DROP IN ATA SELL SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE L. A. N. AND DECLINING ENROLLMENT DISTRICTS SEE THIS AS A LIFELINE LIKE I'M LOSING STUDENTS BRING IN MORE TEA CASE STUDENTS I COULD STABILIZE OUR SITUATION THE DISTRICT AS WELL AS FOCUSING ON THE BENEFITS OF EARLY EDUCATION -- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AS WELL OF COURSE OVER HERE THE THE YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT WELL THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY MORE MONEY PAYING FOR THAT THE NEW KID YOU'RE JUST RE SHUFFLING FROM THE ENTIRE SIX MILLION POPULATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND GRANTED WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND -- INCREASE PROP NINETY EIGHT WE'RE STILL UNDER FUNDING EDUCATION IN GENERAL AND IN MY OPINION COMPARED TO OTHER STATES -- SO YOU COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT WELL FEWER KIDS MORE MONEY WE'RE GIVING YOU ANYWAY YOU THESE THINGS THAT MATCH UP YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM SERVING THESE ADDITIONAL KIDS SINCE YOU'RE DECLINING EVERY YEAR AND GETTING MORE MONEY BUT THIS OTHER PIECE IS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME AND I WONDER IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO US THAT THIS NINETY RAINY DAY FUND INTERPLAY WITH SEXUALLY LESS MONEY HAVING TO BE STASHED AWAY AND COULD GO TO PROP NINETY EIGHT TO PAY FOR STE -- A MAJOR PIECE OR MORE THAN HALF OF HALF OF EACH ADDITIONAL KID IN GOLDEN TICKET YES UNLIMITED MAY JUST QUICKLY GOING BACKWARD CONTACTED YOU MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL TO GUARANTEE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL PROTESTS ONE FORMULA AND OUR EXPECTATIONS THAT WILL NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THAT'S HOW THE COMPANY DURING PEOPLE ARE OUR PERMITTED TO WORK IT'LL BE A PICTURE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES THAT WILL GO TO PARK TO PROPAGATE SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOING UP OR DOWN BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TENANTS LIKE AS SO AS YOU MENTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT IS HAPPENING TO ME FIRST OF TWENTY IS GOING UP BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE CONCERNS FROM SOME FOLKS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE EXPANDING TRANSACTION CONFIRMED THAT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS NOT GOING TO GO UP IF YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL TWO TICKETS I'M SORRY AND I THINK THAT'S STILL THE CASE BIG PICTURE IN THE LONG RUN -- DOESN'T GO UP THE WE STILL THINK THAT YOU COULD FUND THE PROGRAM YOU WANT TO WITHIN GROWTH MATURITY AND OKAY WHEN THEY ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THIS -- THIS BUDGET YEAR SO IN BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE REVENUES HAVE GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT SOME OF THE FUNDING -- THAT'S GOING TOWARDS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IN THE BUDGET YEAR BE DEPOSITED INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY TAX -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF FORMULAS THAT ARE THAT GO TO COULD PROTECT IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WHAT THE AMOUNT WOULD BE DEPOSITED INTO THAT RESERVE BUTTON THERE IS WITH A CALCULATION TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE TAKING YOUR BASELINE PROGRAM I'M HERE WITH A FUNDING TO GROW BY A CERTAIN THE WHOLE SOUL DISTRIBUTION OF INTENTIONAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE END OF YOUR DON'T INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DISTRIBUTED OUT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS YEAR I'M NOT INTO THE RESERVE SO IF YOU WERE STATE TO EXPAND -- ABOUT SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL CARE OUR PROGRAM THIS YEAR ON IT WOULDN'T EVEN YOU HAVE TO SAY CUT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNMENT WE JUST NEED THAT THE AMOUNT WOULD BE DEPOSITED IN THE RESERVE WOULD BE DECREASED YEAH SO THAT THE THAT AMOUNT THIS DEPOSITED IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT NOT FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION HERE THAT GROWS FOR THE STUDENTS SO IT'S ONE TIME MONEY OR TAKING FROM THERE FROM THE RAINY DAY PROP NINETY EIGHT FUND PUTTING IN THE PAST NINETY EIGHT BASS AND THAT GROWS AS A STUDENTS GO TO FIRST GRADE SECOND GRADE SO FAR CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A LOST CAUSE THE PROBLEM THE DEPOSIT IS A ONE TIME DEPOSIT WHEN YOU'RE GENERAL IDEA WITH THE COMPANY TO RESERVE DEPOSIT IS THE NEXT YEAR THAN WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD DEPOSITED NOT MANY WOULD RESULT OR OTHER ACTIVITIES IF YOU ARE SERVING ADDITIONAL TICKET THIS YEAR THAT MEANS YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DOCTORS YOU'RE FREE TO SELECTIVITY COULD BE GOING TOWARD SERVING THE CHILDREN ARE VIEWED AS A WITH A LOT ABOUT A DOZEN TICKETS COMING IN IF YOU'RE SOFT ON IT IT IS A NEW YORKER MEETINGS YOUR ONGOING PROBLEM ANY RESOURCES FOR TRANSITION KERN I'M THERE IS NOT AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN TERMS OF MAKING CUTS TO OTHER PROGRAMS WE WERE WE WE NOTED WE THINK GIVEN GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED YOU COULD FIND OUT EXPLAINS IN TERMS NGUYEN YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO MUCH OTHER PROGRAMMATIC AUGMENTATIONS BUT AGAIN IF IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WE FIGURED WE DETECTED THE DOCTOR WELL UNDER THE CURRENT ON ROAD FOR CUSTOMER CITY AND THEN YOU SEE SAID WERE IN THIS TEST ONE FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WHICH IS A FINITE POT OF MONEY FOR EDUCATION BUT ONCE WE LEAVE TEST ONE THEN THESE NEW STUDENTS ARE GENERATING EIGHTY EIGHT PER STUDENT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT ALTHOUGH I THINK UNDER THE LATEST -- IN ORDER OUTLOOK COMMITTEE MET MOST OF THE LATEST ON OUR FORECAST THAT WE'VE DONE BUT WE DIDN'T TEST ONE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE CRIME IN IN ALMOST THREE HOURS SO I COULD OR ITS POSITION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE IF THIS ONE ARE MOVING FORWARD WHAT'S IT LIKE TO REPORT EVEN THE THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS IN OUR AND THEN THAT CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT THE -- THAT THE FINANCIAL SCENARIO WHY LOOK DISTRICTS WHO HAVE MAJOR DECLINING ENROLLMENT ARE SO INTERESTED IN TEEKAY EXPANSION BESIDES THE FACT THAT I THINK HOPEFULLY AND ALTRUISTIC THINGS THEY BELIEVE THAT MORE EARLY EDUCATION FOR MORE CALIFORNIA'S A BETTER THING FOR OUR OUR KIDS IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR ECONOMY AND SO FORTH BUT FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW MOST DISTRICTS AREN'T DECLINING ENROLLMENTS ITSELF THE DISTRICTS THAT THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WHY DID THE VIEW IT SO FAVORABLY FINANCIALLY WHAT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE DISTRICT IS IN THE COMING IN WITHOUT THE OFTENTIMES WOULD MAKE HIM -- HELLO MORE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE PART WAS GOING ON AS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING YOU KNOW THESE DECLINES ARE HAPPENING OFTENTIMES PRETTY MINOR BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE SEEING ONE OF YOUR KIDS PER PER CLASSROOM -- AND STRANDED SO YOU'RE ALREADY SMALL DECLINES BUT YOU HAVE SOME FIXED COSTS BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY CUT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE JUST HAVING ONE FEWER KICKOFF IN YOUR OLD SCHOOL -- YOU'RE GONNA GET MUSCLE SPECIFIC FUNDING BECAUSE OF THAT BUT YOUR NUMBERS ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO REDUCE YOUR MORE HORSES SO THOSE THINGS OVER TIME COMPOUND TO BECOME MORE CHALLENGING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IF YOU WERE TO EXPAND IT -- THAT COULD OFFSET SOME OF THE CLINTON IN A MOMENT I NEED TO WRITE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND TO THE -- TO GET SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL REVENUES -- -- ARE ARE GREATER THAN THE INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW COULD NOT BE THAT DISTRICTS WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL ARE IN BETTER FISCAL POSITION THEY MIGHT BE ABLE PERFECT AND IN LAST FINANCIAL QUESTION ABOUT THIS I KIND OF MENTIONED THIS EARLIER BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE NOTION THAT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHAT'S THAT DROPPED AGAIN THE PERCENTAGE WERE DROPPING BY EVERY YEAR DECLINE WE WE HAVE BEEN DROPPING BY IT'S LESS THAN ONE PERCENT BOTH GOING TO COME TO THE RIGHT THE MOST RECENT DATA WE'VE BEEN DROPPING I THINK OUR FOCUS WAS MORE THAN ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PERCENT FOR THE COMING YEAR YEAH AND OF COURSE IS THIS PAST YEAR WAS YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S ROTH AND ALL KINDS OF FUNKY NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT THAT PANDEMIC WITH SPECIALLY THE EARLIER YOUNGER GRADES SO THIS NOTION THAT WE ARE HAVING DECLINING IN ENROLLMENT SO WE'RE SERVING THE OUR STUDENTS AND THEN PROP NINETY EIGHT AS AT THIS ALL TIME HIGH GRANTED SOMEONE SAY SCHOOLS ARE WERE NOT PROPERLY FUND IN THE FIRST PLACE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT DO YOU RESPOND TO THE NOTION THAT WELL IF YOU HAVE IF YOU IF IF CALIFORNIANS HAVING FEWER KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM WE'RE GIVING THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE MONEY ANYWAY -- MAYBE DOESN'T IT ISN'T THAT ISN'T THAT MUCH OF A STRETCH TO TO THROW AN ADDITIONAL RTK KIDS IN THE MIX PEOPLE WE RECORDS WAS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IS IS JUST HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPEND WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN A WAY THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE BEST FOR CERTAIN DIFFERENCES SO OBVIOUSLY IN THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS ARE YOU CAN DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT TO USE SOME OF THOSE INCREASES FUNDING TO AUGMENT OR SUPPLEMENT YOUR EXISTING CONTROL PROGRAMS OF CIRCUITS WERE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN SCHOOL THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF COURSE YOU COULD TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE TO K. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TAKEN OFF OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL THIS IS A REAL ONE OF THEIR KEY FUNDING FOR THE EARLIER GRADES WE WANT TO HELP SUPPORT AND EXPAND PRESCHOOL SERVICES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE -- YOUR BENEFITS FIRST INFINITY LATER DOWN THE LINE I THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING BETTER WE THINK ANY OF THOSE OF COURSE ISN'T SO I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- YOU KNOW IT BURLESQUE CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED YOU GENERATED AND MORE AT THE CAN BROADLY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY WHEN YOU'RE AVAILABLE WHAT MIGHT BE THE BEST USES WILL SPEND THOSE FUNDS TO THE BANK BECAUSE OKAY AND THEN LASTLY I I DIDN'T GET TO IT BUT AS THE AGENDA ALLUDES TO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR IN THE MASTER PLAN AND CAN BRACE TEEKAY NOT THIS IS THE MOST LOGICAL WE ALREADY HAVE A TAKE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IT'S WE HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND YOU COULD HAVE A PART PROFESSIONAL AND THEY'RE STILL PICK THE CORRECT RATIO OF IS THE FACT THAT -- IN A RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A UNIVERSAL PROGRAM IS A BETTER PROGRAM ON YOU SIR YOU SERVE BROADER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION -- PLUS YOU DON'T HAVE THIS INEQUITY WORK ON KIDS BORN DURING THE FALL WHEN THE LOTTERY GET A FREE YEAR OF OF PUBLICLY FUNDED PRE K. ABOUT HOW FOR -- A ART OTHERS THAT THAT T. K. REALLY IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER AND HELPS ALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY A TEN YEAR PILOT PROJECT WITH A QUARTER OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THAT'S SHOWN TO BE OKAY SO I I KNOW WE HAVE A SOMEONE EVERYBODY THAT ESTIMATES ON THE NUMBER OF DONALD WELL I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND EXPANDING -- POSSIBLY SEVENTY K. SEE IN MY DISTRICT DISASTER PLANNING AND ROMAN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS IN BONDS A BILL AVAILABLE BUT THIS IS ALSO A REALLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR US TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE MIDDLE CLASS WHO CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PRESCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT BUT THEN THEY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY AND DON'T NECESSARILY QUALIFY FOR STATE PRESCHOOL HEAD START TOP OF IT IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL AND CRUCIAL TIME THAT WE FUND AND EXPAND TKA I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO WILL BE FOUR IN APRIL SO THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY AND GIVEN MY BACKGROUND AS A PRESCHOOL PROVIDER BUT FOR THE LAST YEAR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE BEEN AT HOME AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BIRTHDAY PARTIES THEY'RE NOT HANGING OUT IN IN YOU KNOW IN PLACES WHERE THEY'RE PLAYING WITH OTHER KIDS WERE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE IN THE CLASSROOM OR PLAYBASE SETTING LIKE QUALITY CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE CREATED IN THOSE NORMAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE NOT HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPENING FOR A YEAR SO THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION -- UNLIKE MY FIRST QUESTIONS ARE UNLIKE THE CURRENT T. K. PROGRAM WHICH IS BASED ON ELIGIBILITY THE GOVERNOR'S HE CAN ROMAN PROPOSAL WOULD PRIORITIZE GRANT FUNDING BASED IN PART ON ELEAZAR -- PROPORTION OF ADULT LANGUAGE A BILL LANGUAGE STUDENTS I'M WHY NOT TAKE A PHASED IN APPROACH AVAIL OF ELIGIBILITY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE AND IT MOVED KINDERGARTEN FROM DECEMBER SECOND CUT OFF TO -- SEPTEMBER SECOND CUT OFF WHY COULDN'T WE JUST KIND OF DO A REVERSE PHASE AND -- LEAD THAT DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT AND IT AND THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THERE AS WELL IS IS IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL TO PRIORITIZE T. CARROLL MET FOR ASK RIP RISK POPULATIONS WHILE KATIE TWELVE MAINTAINS UNIVERSAL ACCESS HELLO AGAIN THIS IS -- SERRA BURNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO ON TO GET YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT PHASING IN THIS PROGRAM SO SO THESE PARTICULAR PROPOSALS ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON BUILDING CAPACITY IN THE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT OF MORE TRANSIT MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES ACCESS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND EARLY TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ON THAT'S WHY WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES UP UP GRANT PROGRAMS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN FOR THESE INCENTIVE GRANTS I'M NOT TO MENTION THE PART OF THE INCENTIVE GRANTS TO -- ARE PHASED IN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS -- AND THE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA ON THE FIRST YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO SEE HOW MANY MORE A FOUR YEAR OLD ELLIE IS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR -- THEN PROVIDE THE GRANT FUNDING IN THE LATTER TWO YEARS SO WE BELIEVE THAT COUPLED WITH THE CAPACITY BUILDING MEASURES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PROVIDE A VERY STRONG BASED ON FOR EXPANDING THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM -- AND THEN TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRIORITIZE IS AT RISK -- STUDENTS ARE THERE IS LANGUAGE WITHIN THE PROPOSALS THAT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE FROM GRANT APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE VARIOUS PRIORITIES LIKE ELLIE IS THAT SERVE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THE LANGUAGE LEARNERS INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS HOPEFULLY THAT GETS AYE BOTH OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO THE PROPOSAL'S THEMSELVES GOT IT M. IS THE T. CAN ROMAN PROPOSAL LIMITED TO ONE TIME FUNDING BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS START UP COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY BARRIER IN EXPANDING THE PROGRAMS OR DO OTHER PRIORITIES LIMIT ON GOING FUNDING AND WHAT PRIORITIES WOULD YOU SAY ARE LIMITING YEAH SO I I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF THAT THAT HAVING THESE CAPACITY BUILDING MEASURES IS REALLY IMPORTANT GETTING THESE -- ONE TIME DOLLARS INTO START BUILDING THE STRUCTURE IS WHAT'S DRIVING MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE IN THESE PROPOSALS BALANCING IN OUR FISCAL PICTURE AS WELL SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A PART OF IT BUT WE DEFINITELY SEE A NEED FOR ADDING THESE SUPPORTS DOING IT WITH THESE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO BUILD OFF OF THAT AT A LATER TIME IS A PROPOSED FUNDING RIGHT FOR THE T. CAN ROLL MEANT GRANT EQUAL TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE L. C. FF RATE INTENDED TO ALIGN WITH THE AMOUNT PROVIDED FOR PART TIME STUDENTS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SO IT IS INTENDED TO BE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT ELEAZER RECEIVING IN TERMS OF EIGHTY EFFORT TICE'S STUDENTS CURRENTLY -- AND IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS -- I'D HAVE TO PASS IT OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE BASELINE ANSWER FOR YOU RIGHT THERE IF YOU'RE CALLING ON ON THE LINE YES HI -- OVER THIS VIDEO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN AND I I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT OTHER THAN MENTIONED THAT I AM AWARE WAS NOT DEVELOPED WITH SPECIFIC REGARD TO -- THE RATE THAT YOU MENTIONED THANK YOU I'M SO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORK FORCE -- ONE OF THE VERY -- GLARING ISSUES ON THE BACKGROUND I WAS READING WAS THE RATIOS -- CURRENTLY IN TKD ONE AND TWO AND AND AND MCCARTY BROUGHT THIS UP -- ERASED CURRENT TICKET RATIOS ARE ONE TO THIRTY THREE -- AND COMING I JUST CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE COMING FROM A PRESCHOOL PROVIDER BACKGROUND -- NOT HAVING -- SMALLER RATIOS I MEAN WE ALL AIM FOR SMALLER RATIOS BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES DELIVER QUALITY I'M PRESCHOOL SO I'M WHAT WHAT IS WHAT WOULD YOUR PROPOSED RATIOS BE THIS IS SERRA BURNER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES -- TO SO THE RATIOS AT THIS TIME I WILL SAY THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS I WILL GO TOWARDS EXPANDING THE POOL OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS AS WELL AS INCREASING THEIR COMPETENCIES AND SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE ARE PROVIDING INSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS AND SUPPORT FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING LEARNING TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES MITIGATING IMPLICIT BIASES SO IT DOESN'T QUITE GET AT THAT RATIO QUESTIONS BUT THE INTENT OF THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS IS TO GET AT THE BUILDING THESE COMPETENCIES AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS OVERALL AND I'M NOT SURE IF IF YOU KNOW ANYONE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT WHAT AT IT'S OBVIOUSLY VITAL THAT -- DO WE PUT FUNDING TOWARDS GROWING THE WORKFORCE DOING NO -- WHAT HOW MANY EASY PROFESSIONALS WOULD NEED TO BE RECRUITED -- TO ACCOMMODATE THE EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM DOES THE L. A. L. IF IF NOT THAT'S OKAY YOU GUYS CAN GET BACK TO ME THERE WERE TIED WITH THE LA -- A WE DON'T HAVE ANY ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT BUT WILL DO SOME THINKING AND WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO GET BACK TO YOU I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT I'M SO WHAT ARE THE COMPARATOR ALL EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS THAT QUALIFY A TEACHER FOR T. K. CLASSROOMS -- CAN CURRENCY K. KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS CONTINUE WORKING AND TAKE A CLASSROOMS WITHOUT A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT -- TWENTY FOUR UNITS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION OR CHILD DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION AND DO THE REQUIREMENTS THAT GOING TO AFFECTS ON A FACT ON AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONLY APPLY TO NEW T.

KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS CONTINUE WORKING AND TAKE A CLASSROOMS WITHOUT A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT OR TWENTY FOUR UNITS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD AND HER CHILD DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION WE'LL START WITH THAT ONE NUMBER OF BLOOD THINNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL TAKE IT AS STOP IT YOU FOR THAT AND -- THAT PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOR MULTIPLE SUBJECT INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES BUT SPECIFIC TO INSTRUCTION RELATED TO -- TEACHING CHILDREN AGES FIVE AND OLDER -- WITH REGARDS TO THAT TICE T. K. TEACHER CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT TEEKAY TEACHERS -- PASSIVATION UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CHILDREN AGES THREE TO FIVE -- ARE ARE DEVELOPING AN IN ORDER TO BEST AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVELOPMENT -- MY COLLEAGUES ARE MENTIONED -- SOME OF THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TEEKAY PROPOSALS THAT YOU YOU SEE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ARE REALLY EIGHT INTENDED -- TO TARGET AND BETTER PREPARE AND THOSE TEACHERS AS WELL AS EXPAND THE POOL OF TEACHERS THAT HAVE THAT -- HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE -- THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THAT TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROCESS I THINK WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND I KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE -- A MEMBER ON THIS PANEL YEAH I KNOW YOU GREAT JAVA ANSWERING THAT QUESTION THEN AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL PROBABLY DISCUSS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE THANK YOU GOOD QUESTIONS CAN I JUST ASK ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I WANNA GET LOST ON IT FOR -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN YOU COME BACK ON THE ON THE ON GOING FUNDING QUESTION VERSUS ONE TIME AS ONE ONE CLARIFICATION YEAH I'M HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAPPY TO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DID YOU DID YOU WANT TO TO -- ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION JUST LIKE CLARIFICATION A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO SOMEONE MEMBER BY ADARSH QUESTION ABOUT -- THE ONE TIME MONEY IN SUPPORT FOR FOR -- FOR IMPLEMENTATION FOR START UP GRANT SO IF THE GOVERNOR HAS EMBRACED TKA HAS A WAY TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN YOUR PROVIDING IN THE MASTER PLAN AND YOUR PROVIDING ONE TIME MONEY INTO THESE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FOR START UP FUNDS DOES THE GOVERNOR VIEW THE CURRENT PROP NINETY EIGHT STRUCTURE AS ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT TEEKAY EXPANSION FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU CAN CLARIFY DEPARTMENT FINANCES PERSPECTIVE ON THAT RIGHT I THINK AT THE MOMENT JUST REITERATE MY EARLIER COMMENT AND AND ALSO HOW TO BUILD UPON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE EDGAR CABRAL WITH L. A. O. SHARED AS WELL THAT -- WE FEEL AS FAR AS PRUDENT C. IS CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT OUTLOOK -- I REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE'S ALREADY EVEN WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S WHAT'S PROPOSED EVEN WITH ALL THE THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND GROPING GUARANTEE -- WITH THE REBOUND OR REVENUE -- AFTER COAL BIT SO DIFFERENT BEING SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING AFTER THE BUDGET ACT WE ARE STILL PROPOSING A THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR -- ESTIMATED K. TWELVE A PORTION OF THE FOR -- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE UNDERSTATED SO AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHY I KEEP REALLY IN A COUNTY NOTHING DRUM THAT THAT WE REALLY FEEL IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MAKES UP ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WORK TO A WEEK WE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS IS WARRANTED AROUND ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVING IT YES THE INFLUX OF ADA AND WHILE SOME ELLIE AS MATE MIGHT FIND THAT HELPFUL AND A AND A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ONGOING FUNDING AVAILABILITY IS IS -- WARRANTED AT THIS TIME OKAY WELCOME BACK MISTER O'DONNELL GREAT THANK YOU AND I WON APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO'S ADVOCACY TO INCREASE T. K. AND SURVIVE IN A PRESCHOOL CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE THEY NEED AN ADVOCATE BUT I ALSO THINK THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE WHAT TO CAN HALF THE GRADE TWELVE -- NEED AN ADVOCATE TO AND MY CONCERN WAS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PROPOSALS IS THERE REALLY THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE PRACTICAL AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT CERTAINLY I WANT TO SERVE AND DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR FOR FREE SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TO FIND IT AND FIND IT IS KEY BUT MY FEARS WERE JUST TAKING FROM OTHER STUDENTS AND GIVING IT TO SOME STUDENTS AND THAT THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN COMES IN AND I'M SURE THAT BEFORE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK THE L. A. THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS MIGHT BE -- IT COULD BE IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT WE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY ADDING A GRADE LEVEL TO AN ALREADY UNDER FUNDED T. CAN HAVE TWELVE SYSTEM THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WITHOUT ADDING MORE MONEY TO THAT SYSTEM WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST YOU KNOW WE'RE LOWERING THE TIGHT WE'RE LOWERING THE THE AMOUNT WE FUND ALL GRADES HAD IN AN IN AN ALREADY RADICALLY UNDER FUNDED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WHERE ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION ON A PER STUDENT BASIS AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT WITHIN THESE PROPOSALS I JUST UNDER FUNDING EVERYBODY AND ADDING STUDENTS I DON'T THINK REALLY HELPS I THINK YEAH ADEQUATELY FUNDING ALL STUDENTS IS REALLY THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IF WE HAD IF WE HAD A T. CARE DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE TAKING AWAY FROM SIX CREATORS IT -- EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S MORE QUESTIONS THIS TIME THAN THEY REALLY AN OPINION BUT THAT THERE ARE IN A LIFE OF THE POLICY DILEMMA AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A BODY TO ADDRESS -- AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS WHAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR TO CANCEL THEY CAN RESPONSIBLE ONE TIME RIGHT ONE TIME CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FIFTY MILLION FOR EARLY EDUCATION PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ONE TIME MONEY TO ONE TIME EXPENDITURES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOR GRANTS TO INCREASE EARLY ACCESS I ASSUME THAT MEANS LOTS OF FOR TEA CASE STUDENTS I HAVE TO QUESTION THE PRACTICAL AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARENA SAY FOR ONE YEAR YOU HIRE TEACHERS FOR ONE YEAR YOU DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR THE STUDENTS WE SHOULD HAVE A GREATER COMMITMENT TO THAT EFFORT THAN JUST ONE YEAR AND I GET WHY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ONE YEAR IS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO COMMIT THAT MONEY IN THE OUT YEARS BECAUSE IF WE HAD A ROUGHER TIMES IN THE ULTIMATE IMPACT COULD BE THAT THEY WERE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER GROUPS WERE JUST ADDING GRAYSON FLATTENING THE AMOUNT SO THOSE ARE KIND OF MY CONCERNS I MEAN IT WAS EVEN ALLUDED TO THERE SO -- WHAT SOMEONE FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE AND AS SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORT THAT TO FROM WHAT WAS YOUR WITH THEM KIND OF YOU KNOW THANK YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT IS AYE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FOLKS FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE MERELY TALK ABOUT CLASS SIZE REDUCTION FOR TEEKAY WE'VE GOT HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS THAT ARE TEACHING LANGUAGE ARTS WITH THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN THE CLASS AND THAT'S THIRTY EIGHT ESSAYS OF THEIR TEACHING FIVE PERIODS A DAY DO THE MATH FIVE TIMES THIRTY EIGHT YOU'VE GOT A GREAT THOSE THINGS YEAH AND YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR STUDENTS ENGAGE IN THE DID YOU GET YOU GET YOU KNOW TO KNOW YOUR STUDENTS AND WE NEED CLASS SIZE REDUCTION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL -- SO AGAIN I I THINK -- YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT THEY SEE THIS IS THEIR PATH TO REMAINING FISCALLY SOLVENT I'M OPEN TO THAT I'M SURE I WILL HEAR IT NOW AND I'M I'M QUITE OPEN TO HEARING THAT THAT THIS IS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REMAIN FISCALLY SOLVENT BUT I THINK THE RESPONSIBLE THING FOR US TO DO AS A BODY IS TO COME TOGETHER AND SEE HOW IDENTIFY HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS SO THAT WE DO AT STUDENTS WE SCORE UP THE FUNDING RIGHT WE JUST DON'T ADD STUDENTS TO TO TO AN EXISTING POOL OF DOLLARS AND THE L. A. O. HAS PULLED POINTED OUT THAT THE DOLLARS ARE STATIC MAYBE IN A TEST TO YEAR THEY'RE NOT AS THE CHAIRS POINT OUT WHERE TO TEST ONE YEAR OF THIS YEAR BUT I REALLY THINK AS A BODY WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING TO FUND FREE SCHOOL EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T THINK EXISTING BUCKET OF DOLLARS THAT WE NOW USED TO FUND K. TWELVE EDUCATION SO THAT THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S MY POINT OF VIEW -- I KNOW WILL HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS POLICY TOPIC I'VE BEEN KIND OF FERVENT ON THIS POINT NOT EVERYBODY APPRECIATES IT BUT I THINK SOME DO THAT I WANT I ASSURE THEIR GOAL IT'S JUST HOW WE GET THERE IS WHERE WE DIFFER AND THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WHAT WHAT THOSE IMPACTS WILL BE ON THE EXISTING PULL SO WITH THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU OKAY IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANTED TO I THINK I THINK IT'S IT'S ALL MEANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOUR QUESTIONS KIND OF POINT MADE MY POINT -- THE ONLY -- SPECIFICALLY CITED THAT WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO GROW DOLLARS IF WE GROW THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- -- SOME IMPACTS OF WEATHER NO IT'S JUST WATER TEST TO HEAR EVEN JUST THREE ULTIMATELY -- BUT I THINK IT'S ALL BEEN HIGHLIGHTED I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB OF ASKING YOUR QUESTIONS AND I THINK THEY MADE MY POINT QUITE FRANKLY AND IN FINDING A PATH TO FINDING TEEKAY FOR ALL PRE K. FOR ALL REALLY HAS BEEN YOUR MISSION MISSING MCCARTY ON A YOU KNOW FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WE DO HAVE AN UNDERFUNDED K.
