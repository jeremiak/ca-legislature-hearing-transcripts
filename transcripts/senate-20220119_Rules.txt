I'VE PERSONALLY REVIEWED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MATTERS FOR THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. ALL A. L. ALSO PUBLISHES THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS AND I NOTICED REGISTER AND WE REVIEW OF PETITIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC CHALLENGING STATE AGENCY ACTIONS AS POTENTIAL UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. WE PROVIDE EXTENSIVE TRAINING TO STATE AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO HOW TO DO WILL GROW MAKING AND ALSO HOW TO IDENTIFY WHAT MUST BE ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE APA OR. UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. NEXT WEEK WE WILL ALSO HAVE A PUBLIC INFORMATION CENTRES SESSION FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. TO WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN MORE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE ROLE MAKING PROCESS WE AT O. A. L. TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY AND A MATTER OF PUBLIC TRUST. WE CAREFULLY REVIEW THOSE ROAMING TWENTY SURE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE HAVE BEEN RESPECTED AND THAT'S THE AGENCIES ARE STAYING WITHIN THEIR DELEGATED AUTHORITY. IT WAS WHEN I JOINED- A. L. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF CIVIL LITIGATION PRACTICE THAT I FOUND MY LEGAL PASSION. THE MISSION OF AUDIO AND PROTECING THE PUBLIC'S PARTICIPATION IN THAT MISSION CONTINUES TO BE A MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GOING TO TURN FIRST TO OUR VICE CHAIR TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE VERY IMPOLITE FOR ME TO LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR ANSWER. BECAUSE I AM VERY CHALLENGES ARE WITH TIME I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH BUT I WANTED TO MENTION I DID ONCE YOU. NEED TO LEAVE IT OUT SHARE WITH YOU HOW IMPRESSED I AM WITH YOUR FOCUSING YOUR GOAL FROM THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. IN THE RULEMAKING ISSUE BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED THAT WHEN LEGISLATION IS PASSED AND RULES ARE MADE TO- BY THE VARIOUS AGENCIES DIRECTED BY THAT LEGISLATION. THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATION THE AUTHOR IN CERTAINLY ON MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF MANY OF THESE THINGS SO- I GIVE YOU THUMBS UP IT IS THE GOVERNMENT OF BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU ARE REALLY REALLY. A GATE KEEPER ON THAT AND THAT IS VERY IMPRESSIVESO YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU SENATOR.

YOUR RESUME IN THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDED AND I THINK YOU ARE IMMENSELY QUALIFIED- AND WE ARE. INDEBTED TO YOU FOR WANTING TO SERVE- YOU KNOW I HAVE A QUESTION I NOTICED IN MY READING THAT. SOMETIMES WE AS LEGISLATORS WHEN WE ARE OFFERING BILLS WE HAVE A CARVE OUT. OF THE ATP APA PROCESS. AND YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AND- BY DOING THAT- WE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW CREATING MORE. UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS BY AVOIDING THE APA ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD SORT OF. COURSE CORRECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN- FOR YOUR QUESTION- IF I KIND OF FELT I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO EXEMPTIONS- AND YOU KNOW IT'S TOTALLY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE- WHICH- AGENCIES IN WHICH PROGRAMS WHICH PROCESSES SHOULD BE. FOLLOWED PURSUANT TO THE APA ON THAT IN AND OF ITSELF WOULD NOT CREATE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS BECAUSE- THAT DECISION TO EXAM SOMETHING FROM THE APA PROCESS MEANS. THAT THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THAT AND THAT WOULD NOT AMOUNT TO AN UNDERGROUND REGULATION WHICH WOULD BE A STANDARD RULE OF GENERAL APPLICATION. ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BY A STATE AGENCY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE THROUGH THE APA BUT DID NOT. AND I AM NOT ANY SORT OF EXEMPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE AN AXE WOULD NOT MAKE THEM SUSCEPTIBLE. TO UNDERGROUND REGULATION CHALLENGES. THANK YOU THAT CLEAR FOR- YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL I. I DO THINK WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET IN- CREATING LAWS AND POLICIES THAT ARE CLEAR. TO UNDERSTAND YES AND THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IN THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE INTENDED.

AT DOCTORS MEDICAL CENTER MY HUSBAND WHO'S DONE SOMEWHERE HERE IN IN OUR HOUSE AND- MY TWO COLLEAGUES. OF LUIS MOLINA AND CAMPAIGNING. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS WHO LIVED THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM CHUCK ON MEXICO IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. I WAS THEIR FIRST AMERICAN BORN CHILD. I AM A GRADUATE OF BURBANK HIGH SCHOOL AND THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE RECEIVING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM CSU STANISLAUS IN COMMUNICATIONS. I STARTED MY CAREER WITH STANISLAUS COUNTY AT THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER. AND EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO START MY OWN COMPANY. AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. I AM NOW A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OR ENTREPRENEUR AND COMMUNITY LEADER IN MY COMMUNITY HAVING SERVED BOTH AS A COUNCIL MEMBER AND MAYOR OF MY HOMETOWN OF RIVERBANK CALIFORNIA. I WAS APPOINTED TO THE CALIFORNIA BOATING AND WATERWAYS COMMISSION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BY THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. AND SERVED TWO TERMS. I AM VERY EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR HE SENT TO THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. IT IS TRULY AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ON THIS COUNCIL WHICH IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL THAT HAS A PLAN TO WHICH SHE WATER RELIABILITY. AND PROTECTING THE ECOSYSTEM I CONSIDER THIS APPOINTMENT TO BE A VERY CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENT. BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT OUR WATER ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE SOLVED EASILY HOWEVER I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE PROGRESS AS I FEEL THAT MY BACKGROUND AND WORK AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ADVOCATE AND COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST WILL HELP BUILD MORE RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY COMMUNITY GROUPS IN THE DELTA. AND AMONG THOSE WHO DEPEND ON THE DELTA. TO EXPAND THE ENGAGEMENT AND INCLUSION OF GROUPS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN HISTORICALLY INCLUDED IN THE PAST IN DELTA DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS. MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME AND TO MY FAMILY FROM THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY AND STATE AND THAT IS WHAT PROPELS ME TO WANT TO GET BACK INTO SERVING MY COMMUNITY.

MADAM CHAIR AND- IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. MISTER MUD WHEN YOU KNOW I ALSO APOLOGETIC FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO- HAVE MY SCHEDULE WORK OUT TODAY FOR US TO- CHAT BEFOREHAND. BUT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE MATERIALS. AND YOUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS AND- VERY HAPPY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO I THINK YOU'RE IMMENSELY QUALIFIED FOR IT YOU KNOW I AM. FROM LOS ANGELES AND REPRESENTS- AND URBAN DISTRICT. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- WATER IS A BIG THING NOT ONLY FOR THE STATE. BUT FOR L. A. N. YOU KNOW WE GET CALLED A LOT OF NAMES FOR THE WATER THAT WE USE. AND JUST WANTED TO. GET YOUR TAKE ON HOW YOU BALANCE THE NEEDS OF. YOU KNOW FOUR MILLION DELTA RESIDENTS WHO OPPOSE THE TUNNELS ECOLOGICALLY UNIVERSES. ALMOST TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO NEED A RELIABLE AND SAFE WATER SOURCE YOU KNOW- BEING ON THIS COUNCIL IS ABOUT MANAGING MULTIPLE PRIORITIES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THE SAME OR EQUAL VALUE AND JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON. THOSE SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY NEEDS AND- YOUR APPROACH TO BALANCING THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR. SO I'D LIKE TO JUST PROMISED THIS BY LETTING YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY WE ON THE WATER- WATER IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF OUR LIFE. AND IS A FORMER COMMUNITY ORGANIZER FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION AND WE'RE TRANSFORM I SAW THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF NITRATES IN DRINKING WATER IN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS LAWRENCE. EVERY DAY MONTEREY TRACK WHERE I WORK HE AND I WHERE WERE HAVING DEBATE THEIR BABIES AND BOTTLED WATER AND SO. I BECAUSE THE TAP WATER WAS SO CONTAMINATED. SO I DO FEEL THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND A BALANCE FOR US TO HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER WHILE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE NEED TO HELP SUSTAIN OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. BY PROVIDING WATER. THAT HELPS US TO GROW OUR INVESTABLE CENTER. PAGE WE DEPEND FOR A DAY LIFE. WE DO HAVE- OBVIOUSLY WATER QUALITY RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DELTA PLAN BUT MOSTLY THIS IS IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS SO I APPROACH. THIS TASK IN THIS ROLE- OBVIOUSLY LEANING ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IS AVAILABLE TO US- ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT- OF COURSE ARE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE BOARD AND OUR LEAD PLAINTIFF- DOCTOR LARSON. BUT I DO ALWAYS. I FEEL THAT IT'S A BALANCE IF YOU WILL BUT ALWAYS ENSURING THAT- WE NEVER COMPROMISED DRINKING WATER FOR ANYBODY I THINK THAT THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL- PRIVILEGE THAT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THE WORLD THE RIGHT TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER- IN OUR STATE. WELL I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE IN AS YOU WERE TALKING I WAS THINKING BACK ACTUALLY TO MY TOUR. WITH THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AND THE AMAZING WORK I THINK THEY'RE DOING TO BE A- GOOD PARTNER IN HOW WE USE WATER HOW WE RECLAIM WATER HOW WE- ACQUIRED. BE MORE JUDICIOUS- WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS A FINITE RESOURCE IN SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD- YOU KNOW TAKE CARE OF IN A IN IN A PRECIOUS MANNER. AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DEEPLY RELIANT UPON I MEAN YOU KNOW. TO MY COLLEAGUE. FROM- WELL TO MY COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT OF ME- IT'S A THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ARM TO THOSE IN THE AG INDUSTRY WHO ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GROWING THE KIND OF SUSTENANCE THAT WE CAN SELL NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIANS BUT TO FOLKS ACROSS THE WORLD IS A PRECIOUS COMMODITY AND IT'S PART OF A VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMY- AND YET THERE ARE FOLKS ACROSS. THE STATE AND OTHER PARTS THAT RELY ON IT NOT NECESSARILY FOR BUSINESS BUT TO LIVE. AND SUSTAIN AND SO HOW WE BALANCE ALL OF THOSE NEEDS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT- TAKING ADVANTAGE OR MARGINALIZING GROUPS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I FEEL LIKE YOUR VOICE WILL BE ADDED TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE IN THAT SPACE AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU MADAM PRESSURE WELCOME MR DOING L. M. TODAY COMMITTEE I KNOW THIS IS A RECONFIRMATION FOR YOU- I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES'S COMMENTS- ESPECIALLY SINCE I ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO REPRESENT- TWO OF THE TOP FOOD PRODUCE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD NOT JUST THE STATE. AND FROM KERN BEING TO AND TULARE BRING THREE. BUT I A BIT. I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT- BALLOTS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES DID I DO APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT YOU DID HAVE SOME TYPE OF THAT GREEN BRINGING IN THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. M. AND I DO APPRECIATE VERY VERY MUCH THAT YOU ARE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AND SOMETIMES- MY COMMENTS ARE AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR YOU KNOW THIRTY ONE YEARS IN THE STATE IN SPITE OF THE STATE SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WAITED HERE TOO. SO I APPRECIATE THAT BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU MENTIONED- THAT WATER RELIABILITY AND SO AS WE MENTIONED THAT IT MADE ME THINK OF THE- ABOVEGROUND STORAGE IN THAT WATER RELIABILITY AND COMMENT IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT WE WOULD NEED MORE ABOVE GROUND STORAGE. YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT THERE IS- A LOT OF EMPHASIS PUT ON STORAGE AND ALTHOUGH I DO. LEAVE THAT WE DO NEED- ADDITIONAL STORAGE I ALSO BELIEVE IN THE NOTION OF CONSERVATION RECYCLING AND MAKING MORE INVESTMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO WATER SUPPLY SO I DON'T THINK THAT STORAGE IS THE ONLY ANSWER I THINK THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE WAYS- AGAIN INCLUDING. CONSERVATION RECYCLING AND MAKING ANY AND ALL INVESTMENTS POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WATER SUPPLY. THANK YOU- HOW WOULD YOU BALANCE THE NEEDS FOLLOWING UP ON MY COMMENT- THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES HOW WOULD YOU BALANCE THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- OF LOS ANGELES GETS A LOT OF THEIR WATER- FROM YOU KNOW THE DATE BAY AREA DELTA AREA. IN THE CONVEYANCES STEM AND SO DOES THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE START CONSTITUENTS THAT DON'T HAVE RUNNING WATER. MYSELF MISS CAN BE- OPUS HER TADO- OUR CONSTITUENTS TURN THERE ARE SOME OF THEM THAT TURN ON THE FAUCET THERE'S NO WATER THAT COMES. AND DOES DOES THE COUNTY OR THE STATE- I THINK IT'S A CITY BUT THEY DELIVER- WATER TO THEIR HOUSES IN THESE BIG BLACK- CONTAINERS EVERY WEEK SO THAT THERE'S SOME TYPE OF WATER SO. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THAT RECEIVE THEIR DRINKING WATER FROM THE DELTA WITH THE INTEREST OF THE DELTA COMMUNITY. COLLEGE MEN'S AND R. FOUR MILLION STRONG. GREAT QUESTION AND- AGAIN WITH ALL TRANSPARENCY IDEA. TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES- THAT DID HAVE TO GET. THEIR WATER. AND TRANSPORTED IN A BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DRINK IT THEY COULDN'T OPEN THE FAUCET LIKE I CAN LIKE YOU CAN AND BE ABLE TO DRINK OUT OF THE TAP- I THINK THAT IT'S- CRITICAL THAT WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL I'M SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE STATE AND NOT ONE REGION. YES AS I READ- WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED FOR US TO DO. I BELIEVE THAT THE DELTA% PROTECTION COMMISSION EXISTS TO BE ABLE TO ELEVATE THOSE VOICES AND THOSE NEEDS- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO WORK. VERY STRATEGICALLY WITH OUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES AND IT THRILLS ME AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN. LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE ON THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THAT BEING SUPERVISOR DONNA TOLD ME SO I THINK THAT IT'S THAT BALANCE THAT DELICATE BALANCE- BUT FOR ME I TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER JUST KNOWING THAT. I DO COME FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY KNOWING THAT I DID REPRESENT AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED THAT PRECIOUS DRINKING WATER- I WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE AND MAKE CERTAIN. THAT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES OF THE BOYS AND THE ADVOCACY WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH LOCAL- COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE RELIABLE CLEAN DRINKING WATER- I REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TURN ON THEIR- FAUCET AND GET WATER AND SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT YOU WILL DO. I'M IN THE BALANCE TO HELP THOSE CONSTITUENTS. I- I ALSO HAVE A CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL WOULD PLAY IN ASSURING THAT BALANCED APPROACH IS WOULD BE PROTECTIVE FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AS WELL AS- HABITAT ENHANCEMENT. I SOMETIMES THINK THAT IT'S AN AT ALL COST FOR HABITAT ENHANCEMENT- AND THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH WAIT AND- PUT ON OUR ECONOMY. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE SO CAN YOU TELL ME THE BALANCED APPROACH THAT SHE WOULD HAVE IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. SURE WELL RECOGNIZING AGAIN THAT I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND RECOGNIZING. THAT THE DELTA- IS. THE HEART OF IT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE MONEY IT'S I'M SORRY THE DELTA IS IN THE HEART OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE COMMODITY AND- IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I BELIEVE ACCOUNT FOR FORTY FIVE BILLION IN ANNUAL SALES SO I DO RECOGNIZE THAT. THE DELTA PLACE HE CRITICAL AND PIVOTAL ROLE- TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND SO. ENSURING THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH HE STAKEHOLDERS. AND MAKING SURE THAT VOICES. RESPECTED AND HOW I TRY TO APPROACH THIS AND DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE A CONVENER. THAT WE ARE TAKING AGAIN AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WITH THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AVAILABLE TO US. ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH OUR INDEPENDENT SCIENCE BOARD AND WITH OUR LEAD SCIENTIST- AND AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AS INDEPENDENT. AND IN OUR SCIENTIFIC VIEWS- AND THAT THIS IS NOT POLITICAL OR GETTING POLITICAL PREFERENCE TO ANYONE BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT BY OUR STATE. AND BY ALL THAT ARE SERVED BY ADULTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND- I JUST A YOU KNOW AGAIN THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH YOU GREW UP IN. AS THEIR SEVERAL COMMITTEES I THINK THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED AND SOMETHING COMMODITIES WHICH THE CENTRAL VALLEY GIRLS 99% OF. SO I MEAN IF YOU WERE GOING TO START BRING PISTACHIOS- CUTIES ARE ALL THOSE THINGS IN ANOTHER LOCATION AT THE UNITED STATES OR ANOTHER COUNTRY IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THOSE TREES MATURE TO PROVIDE THOSE PRODUCTS. OR THOSE COMMODITIES AND- IS THERE A BACKUP PLAN I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THERE IS A BACK UP PLAN FROM THESE AGENCIES AND WHEN I SAY BACKUP PLAN I MEAN THAT. IN OUR FARMERS AND GROWERS THE CARD IS ZERO ALLOCATION FOR WATER LAST YEAR I DON'T ANTICIPATE IT BEING HIRED THIS YEAR. AND FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE DELTA- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE STRATEGIC COUNCIL. BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT WATER DISTRIBUTION AND IS ARE YOU AWARE EVER DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A BACK UP PLAN ON WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET FOOD FOR FOOD SECURITY ISSUES FOR NOT ONLY. THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THE AND- TIRED UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE ARE A BACK UP PLAN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT. IF WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW FARMERS TO HAVE WATER TO GROW FOOD. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF THE- YOU KNOW AS AND REMEMBER I'M I'M KIND OF THE NEWBIE HERE AND- IT'S RECESSES I CAN'T BUT I THINK THAT KIND OF GOES- TO THE QUESTION OF HOW. REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND WHO WHO IS GOING TO GET- WATER IN WHO IS NOT GOING TO GET WATER. AND AS I LOOKING AS I. HAVE I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IF YOU WELL OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS SINCE HAVE SINCE I'VE BEEN APPOINTED. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE DELTA PLAN HAS A REGULATION. NOT REQUIRING ACTIONS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A WATER PROJECT MUST. READ MUST DEMONSTRATE THEIR REDUCED RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND TO DO SO THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEIR LOCAL URBAN AND ADD WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY SHOWED US HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW THE REDUCED RELIANCE- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. HAS THE GUIDANCE AND IS WORKING WITH US- IN IN TERMS OF HOW- THESE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE COMPLYING WITH THE REDUCED RELIANCE AND- REPORTING MECHANISMS. I DO OBVIOUSLY YOU. EMPATHETICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND AGAIN HAVING BEEN RAISED IN AGONY- MY PARENTS WORKED IN AG I AM A CHAMPION IF YOU WILL FOR ADD- AND RECOGNIZING THAT. WE NEED TO DO MORE- AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO PROVIDE AND THAT WATER TESTS WITH OUR FRESH FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME. MEDIATION BANDEL WORK- SOME GUIDANCE FOR HOW WE CAN ALL COME AT THIS TOGETHER AND I DO BELIEVE THAT REDUCING EVERYBODY'S RELIANCE- AND FINDING OTHER WAYS. OF YOU KNOW SO THAT EVERYBODY HAS ITS FAIR SHARE BUT WE CAN'T COMPROMISE IN MY OPINION WE CAN'T COMPROMISE- MUCH OF WHAT. LEADS US ON A DAILY BASIS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I YES I DO I JUST I THINK THAT PEOPLE FOCUS A LOT WHICH IS THERE IS A PORTION OF THIS YOU KNOW. JOBS FARMWORKERS JOBS YOU KNOW OUR FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOREVER AND BUT I THINK WE'RE COMING TO A POINT WITH THE WATER RESTRICTIONS AND- YOU KNOW THAN NOT BEING ABLE TO PUMP GROUNDWATER. AND SOME OTHER STUFF FOR HOW FARMER SURVIVED I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOR HALLOWEEN- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THIS YEAR ALONE AND SO. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE AND FOOD SECURITY ISSUES AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING THIS FROM VISA I KNOW WE CAN GET THEM FROM OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR THAT MEXICO I KNOW WE CAN GET FOOD THAT WE GROW IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM VENEZUELA. BUT I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN ABOUT FOOD SECURITY ISSUES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITHOUT WATER. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO ADD THAT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PLANS PUT TOGETHER SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T RELY ON THE ON THE DELTA FOR WATER RESOURCES. AT BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS BEING REDUCED FROM WATER FROM ALL SITES WHETHER IT'S GROUND WATER THAT DELTA THE CONVENIENCE SUSPEND SURFACE WATER WHICH THEY HAD A CONTRACT TO AGREE WITH I MEAN. IT JUST SEEMS THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING LONG TERM AND F. AND- HERE THAT MAYBE BECAUSE WHEN I'M NOT GONNA SAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE OF TERM LIMITS AND YOU KNOW IN. YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS ALL OF US WILL NOT BE HERE BUT I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES FOR FOOD SECURITY IF WE DON'T FIX THIS SITUATION SPECIFICALLY. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY REDUCE THE. BALLOT WROTE HAVE THE BACK. OF A SPECIAL GROWING TO IN THIS. VALLEY AND BEING AN IMMIGRANT AND BEING IT YOU KNOW YOUR FAMILY FOR YOUR YOU KNOW FOR BEING HERE FROM. IMMIGRATING HERE. AND FOR A BETTER WAY OF LIFE- I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE IS BECAUSE THEY WANT A BETTER WAY OF LIFE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU. AS A BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. A SEAT. IN THE FUTURE- AND ABOUT THE THINGS THAT I DISCUSS WITH YOU TODAY. I WOULD LOVE THAT SENATOR WELCOME BACK AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY MA'AM AND THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MMHM AND- THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME- I REALLY ENJOYED THE MEETING AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED SENATOR COM LONGER. THE FIRM TO SENATOR GROVE AS THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT AND SO. I AM GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON QUESTIONS FROM THE PERSON ON MY LEFT- SENATOR GROW BECAUSE I THINK THAT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE ISSUE BALANCE. OF THE LAW THAT CREATED THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. IN TRYING TO BOUNCE IN THE WALL IT SAID THERE WILL BE DOOR GOALS OF WATER RELIABILITY. AND HABITAT PROTECTION. IN IT AS I USED TO SAY IN A PRIOR INCARNATION AND EVERYBODY'S FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ONE OF THE TWO GIRLS. AND I THINK IT WAS DESIGNED TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SO IF YOU WERE REVIEWING THE PLAN THAT IS FRONT OF YOU AND THE COVERED ACTIONS WHICH IS YOUR STEP TOWARD QUORUM BALANCE THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE LAW. TO MAKE SURE THAT HABITAT PROTECTION IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED AND WATER RELIABILITY IS ADEQUATELYPROTECTED HOW CAN I MAKE SURE DOESN'T TIP ONE WAY ORANOTHER AND WHAT YOU DO. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SENATOR LARRY AND YES IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SPEAK WITH YOU EARLIER TODAY. WELL I REALLY TRULY FEEL THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL- IS IN A- GREAT POSITION AND PROBABLY THE ONLY POSITION TO BE ABLE TO PUSH HARD- AGAIN ON IT THE REDUCING THE RELIANCE- AS A STATUTORY POLICY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT- AND WE SHARED AND DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT IN OUR CALL EARLIER TODAY. IN THAT WE ARE NOT A SCIENTIST BUT WE ARE ALSO INDEPENDENT BOARD ITSELF I ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT MAKES SENSE AND CLEARLY WE HAVE SOME. AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE ECOSYSTEM- THAT THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT BUT IT'S ALSO ENSURING THAT WE AREN'T DOING. THE VERY BEST THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW REDUCING THE RELIANCE. S I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AS WELL. IT'S THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS A LONG TERM PLANNING AGENCY AND AS I LEARN MORE. I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE SOME. SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MAKING- IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE AND I DO TAKE A LOOK AT DELTA DOUBTS IS PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW IN. WE HAVE DONE A BOULDER ABILITY ASSESSMENT IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE AND SO PART OF THAT USED TO INCLUDE AGAIN THE SOCIAL BOTH VOTER ABILITIES THAT EXIST. AND LOOKING AT. ME AT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE IDENTIFIED- TO FIND AGAIN THE MOST PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND THAT ADAPTATION STRATEGIES AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE- I'M GOING WITH YOUR- WITH YOUR COMMENTS- I THINK THAT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT THAT I'M GOING TO BE LEARNING AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THESE. CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND- SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS THAT HAVE ALWAYS ALREADY ASKED FOR ME TO YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. I DO SEE COUNCIL WAS CREATED FOR A PURPOSE- BACK PURPOSE CONTINUES TO INVOLVED BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS NOT STAGNANT AND AS I LEARNED MORE- AND AS WE- ARE APPROACH ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH REPORTS FROM. INDEPENDENT SCIENCE BOARD. THE BILL SCIENCE SCIENTIST IF YOU WILL TO SHARE WITH LEYVA PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. ARE GIVING US AGAIN THE APPROACHES- AND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. THEN I WON'T EXCUSE ME I WILL ENJOY HAVING THOSE TALKS WITH YOU I'D I DO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ON THE ISSUE AND HE SORT OF WALKED INTO MY OTHER QUESTION BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT. THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WAS CREATED FOR A PURPOSE YOU ALSO SAID IT WAS A LONG TERM PLANNING AGENCY. IT WAS ACTUALLY CREATED TO REVIEW THE DELTA PLAN. AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A LONG TERM AGENCY. ONCE IT COMPLETED ITS OBLIGATION TO REVIEW THE PLANS. AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING IS THE THING THAT HAPPENS WITH SOME GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IF THEY FIND A WAY TO PERPETUATE THEMSELVES. AND TO KEEP GROWING AND SO. ARM I JUST GATHERED IN OUR TALK THIS MORNING IT IT TOTALLY AGREE WITH ME. BUT OUR I THOUGHT MAYBE IT TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT I THANK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REVISIT THIS IF IT. IF IT MEETS ITS ORIGINAL STATUTORY DIRECTION FOR ITS PURPOSE- WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YES SO AND THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING- AFTER WE CHATTED EARLIER TODAY AND THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WAS IN FACT. A PART OF THE- PART OF THE I GUESS PLAN WITH EXPERIENCE PROJECT BUT MY AND YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME YOUR HELP EDUCATE ME AND INFORMED ME- BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST THE CONVEYANCE PROJECT BUT IT WAS TO ALSO PROVIDE REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FOR ALL OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO COME BEFORE US AND- AS I AS I HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU EARLIER TODAY- THE OTHER PART THAT POPPED INTO MY MIND IS WHO ELSE WOULD TAKE THE ROLE OF THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IF WE PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE. BECAUSE I SEE THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS REALLY THE ONLY AGENCY AT LEAST AS QUIET AS I SEE IT YOU MAY DISAGREE AND I AND AGAIN I WOULD WELCOME THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU. OF WHO HAS THE VISION AND THE RESPONSIBILITY IN ENSURING THAT WE DO HAVE THAT BALANCE OF THE CALL WE WILL BUILD FOR BOTH THE EAGLE RESTORATION AND THE RELIANCE ON WATER. SO YOU'RE CORRECT I MAY BE MISINFORMED BUT I WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU. MALHAR WAS CHANNELING SENATOR GROWTH BECAUSE USUALLY I COUNT ON OR- TO SAY THAT AN AGENCY MIGHT HAVE OUTLIVED ITS PURPOSE AND WE NEED TO REVISIT IT AND SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD DO IT ON HER BEHALF AND MIGHT BE HALF. IT IN THIS HEARING THIS TIME ARE IN THE IN THE ERROR AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY. THERE'S THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WITH THE DOCTOR CONSERVANCY THERE'S A DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION THERE'S A WHLE HOST OF AGENCIES AND- I THINK THIS HAD A PURPOSE AND WHEN IT REALIZES ITS PURPOSE I THINK IT'S TIME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S OR WHAT IS NECESSARY BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. THAT EXIST BUT BOB I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND. I WILL VOTE FOR CONFIRMATION. COOLEY TRULY APPRECIATE THAT CENTER EARLIER AND I. AGREE WITH WHATYOU'RE- HAVING HAD SERVED IN THE- IN A WATER RESCUE MISSION AND HAVING SEEN HOW IT WAS- AT THAT TIME GOVERNOR. BROWN WAS RESTRUCTURING CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND- TRYING TO STREAMLINE I DO TRULY RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU AND HE DID HAVE AN AGENT WORKING FOR HIM THAT STREAMLINED EDITING AND WATER WAYS INTO THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT. OH MY GOODNESS. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD TO HAVE THE FORMER SECRETARY HERE HI WHO WHO OBVIOUSLY KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT ALL THESE ISSUES- SENATOR LAYERED THANK YOU- I'VE ENJOYED LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS- IN MY- NUMBER OF YEARS HERE IN THE SENATE I'VE SERVED ON THE RULES COMMITTEE BEFORE I WAS PRO TEMAS A MEMBER AND- HAVE LISTENED TO THESE APPOINTMENTS TO- TO THIS BODY. MULTIPLE TIMES. AND HAVE ASKED THE CO EQUAL GOALS AND THE- YOU KNOW AND IT'S BEEN A CHANGING LANDSCAPE FRANKLY BETWEEN GOVERNORS- CLEARLY- ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CLIMATE CHANGE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS SO TO YOUR POINT OF. IS IT TIME FOR SOMETHING TO BE GONE IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY THANK GOODNESS THE SCIENTIST IN THE PANEL ARE OR THEIR TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT. THE EXPERTISE AND THEN OF COURSE I WAS GOING TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE- VULNERABILITY- ASSESSMENT BUT- YOU COMMENTED ON THAT AND- SENATOR LEHRER DID AS WELL. I YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SOME FOLKS HERE WHO REPRESENT VERY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. FOLKS AS FAR AWAY AS LOS ANGELES TWO SENATOR COM AUGERS- COMMENT AND SAY DIEGO HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND THEY HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE DELTA. AS FAR AWAY AS YOU GO AND WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT ONE TUNNEL VERSUS TWO TUNNELS VERSUS- SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES- I DON'T REALLY THINK I CAN ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION MUCH MORE THAN HAS BEEN- STATED EXCEPT TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OR ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAVE CONCERNS AND- CONTINUE TO MONITOR- HOW THIS IS GOING TO PROCEED AND SO I THINK. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSES. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE FROM CENTRAL VALLEY- YOU KNOW. IS IMPORTANT I MEAN IT IS A COMMUNITY THAT'S IMPACTED THE DELTA IS IMPACTED BY DECISIONS WE MAKE. AND SO- I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK I THINK YOU'RE- MORE THAN QUALIFIED- IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS TO STEP INTO THIS ROLE FROM YOUR WORK AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL- IN A COMMUNITY- THAT'S IMPACTED- AS WELL AS THE OTHER WORK YOU'VE DONE.
