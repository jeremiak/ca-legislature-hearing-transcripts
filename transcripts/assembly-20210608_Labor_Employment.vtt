00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:44.054
AT THAT TIME WITH THE NEWMARKET

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:47.391

COULDN'T SELL THEM THEY WOULD

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.470

HEAT WHICH IS REALLY A PERFECT.

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:56.219
ONE TO GET A WHY THIS BILL IS

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:57.087
SO IMPORTANT. OFFICE OF SETTING

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.521
UP THE CENTER HAS INVOLVED

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.290
MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEES

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.325

LIKE ON. ANY OF THE TOPICS

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.305
RELATED TO THE ISSUE IN HERE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.840
THE ECONOMIC DETAILS WERE VERY

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.308
RELEVANT NEVER BROUGHT UP OVER

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.042
AND OVER AGAIN WE GOT INTO

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:20.510
GREAT DETAIL ABOUT WHAT

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:22.746
EMPLOYERS BELIEVED TO BE AT THE

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:24.914
COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE-

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:25.782
AND SO WE HAD THESE ALL OVER

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:28.551
THE STATE. AND THEN AFTER ALL

00:56:28.618 --> 00:56:30.053
THOSE HAD CONCLUDED THERE WERE

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.620
EIGHT DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.455
LANGUAGE THAT WERE PRESENTED

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:33.556
WITH WEEKS TO COMMENTS ON EACH

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:34.858
ONE. AND THE LANGUAGE OF

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:36.126
EVENTUALLY COMPLETED IN APRIL

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:38.261
OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND AS WAS

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.796
MENTIONED IT WAS OVER TWO YEARS

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:40.964
AGO AND SENSE WORKERS HAVE JUST

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.999
BEEN. SITTING AND WAITING AND

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.634
SUFFERING THROUGH THIS HAZARD

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.169
WITHOUT A STANDARD BUT THE

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.971
PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED. WE

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:48.938
LOOKED INTO THE RECORDS AND

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:50.440
FOUND THAT SINCE JANUARY FIRST

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:52.275
OF TWENTY NINETEEN THERE HAVE

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.310
BEEN AT LEAST SIXTY DIFFERENT

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:55.912
INDOOR HEAT SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.647
FILED WITH QALISYA. EVEN

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:59.149
WITHOUT A STANDARD TO ENFORCE

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:00.650
BUT WORKERS THOUGHT THE PROBLEM

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.886
WAS STILL SO BAD. THEY STILL

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:04.254
CALL CALIFORNIA TO SEE WHAT

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.688
COULD B DONE AND THE PROBLEM

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:06.856
IS JUST GOING TO KEEP

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:07.824
CONTINUING UNTIL WE DO

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.559
SOMETHING. AND WILL SOON

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:10.426
BECAUSE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.395
THAT SERIOUS ARE USELESS WE'RE

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:13.763
NOT TRYING TO WEIGH IN ON THEIR

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.899
VALUE FOR OTHER AGENCIES WE AT

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.066
LEAST IN THE CASE OF WORKER

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.635
SAFETY. THEY ARE INTERESTING

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:20.236
AND THEY ARE HELPFUL BUT-

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:21.971
WHATEVER THEIR VALUE IS WE

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:24.240
BELIEVE IT'S IMMEASURABLY LESS

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.742
THAN THE VALUE OF A WORKER'S

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.910
LIFE. AND THAT'S REALLY THE

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.077
DECISION THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.746
BY ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.314
CONTINUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:32.282
TAKE THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.716
DEAL WITH THIS DELAY OF ONE TO

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:34.818
TWO YEARS LETTING WORKERS GET

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.653
HURT. LETTING SOME WORKERS DIED

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:39.022
DEPENDING ON THE HAZARD WHILE

00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:41.558
WE WAIT THIS DOCUMENT TO BE

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.592
WAIT FOR THE DOCUMENT TO BE

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.160
COMPLETED. AND WHATEVER THE

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.762
VALUE IS IT'SJUST NOT AS MUCH

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.764
AS KEEPING WORKERS ALIVE. WE DO

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:48.932
THINK THERE IS PRECEDENT GIVEN

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.667
THAT OTHER AGENCY PROCESSES ARE

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.302
EXEMPT FROM THIS REQUIREMENT I

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.369
THINK IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:59.275
SENSE HERE AND WE STRONGLY URGE.

THAT I FIVE YEARS AGO I OPPOSE

THIS BILL AS WELL I THINK IT'S

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.747
QUITE HONESTLY SHAMEFUL THAT

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.549
ORGANIZED LABOR IS NOT- JUST ON

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.184
PRINCIPLE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:46.521
BILL. BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT. WAS

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:47.922
SAID IN THE PRESENTATION I WANT

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.891

THAT THIS TEACHES KIDS WORK

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.671
ETHIC BECAUSE WE ARE- ALLOWING

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.541
THEM TO WORK SIXTY HOURS IN A

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:10.412
WEEK IS- DISTURBING TO ME

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:13.715
PERSONALLY IT I UNDERSTAND THIS

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:14.916
IS A UNIQUE SITUATION I'VE

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.951
TALKED TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE ABOUT

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.486
THE PAIR SEASON HOW SHORT IT

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.622
IS. WHAT HAPPENS TO JUST FIT

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.758
INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS- AND HOW

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:27.028
THIS PROGRAM IS UNIQUE AND PART

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.129
OF THE TRADITION OF LAKE COUNTY

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:28.830
WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.099
EMPLOYMENT. BUT I THINK FOR ME

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.835
PERSONALLY- I THINK THAT THE

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.505
ONLY WAY WE- HONOR. OUR OUR

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.641
CHILD LABOR LAWS IN THE WHICH

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:42.210
WERE HARD FOUGHT- PEOPLE

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.112
LITERALLY DIED FOR THEM IS WE

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.513
DON'T ALLOW THESE KINDS OF

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.283
EXCEPTIONS AND SO- I HAVE TO

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.150
VOTE NO I WILL CONTINUE VOTE NO

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.886

PERSONAL. I WOULD I WOULD

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.890
SUGGEST THOUGH THAT MAYBE WHEN

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.125
WE TALK ABOUT IT WE CAN TALK

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.260
ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.295
LAKE COUNTY AND THE NEED BUT TO

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.430
SUGGEST. THAT CHILDREN NEED TO

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:03.565
WORK SIXTY HOURS A WEEK TO

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:04.966
TEACH THEM WORK ETHIC OR TO

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.901
GIVE THEM SOME OPPORTUNITY. I'M

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.369
NOT EVEN SURE IF I CAN FOLLOW

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.038
THAT THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.439
FILL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS IN OTHER

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.640

FOR THE- ACTORS BUT- I DON'T.

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.857
PERSONALLY THINK THERE'S ANY-

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.559
REASON. WHY WE SHOULD BE

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:34.963
AWARDING ANYONE. AN EXEMPTION

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:35.864

EIGHT HOURS THEY COULD WORK

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:40.735
THEY WOULDN'T NEED THIS

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:42.103
EXEMPTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

SAW IN A LOT OF PACKING HOUSES

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:17.525
AND DIFFERENT THINGS DURING THE

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:20.428
PANDEMIC- I THINK IT'S-

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:22.096
DISGRACEFUL THAT THE LABOR

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:24.098
COMMISSIONER- SIMPLY CALLED

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.366

NOW NOT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS BUT

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:35.409
TEN YEARS ON- I WOULD SUGGEST

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:36.811
THAT THAT'S NOT QUITE AN

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.012
INSPECTION IT'S NOT CLEAR AN

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.447
INSPECTION WAS EVER DONE WHEN

01:33:39.513 --> 01:33:41.649
THERE WERE WORKERS THERE- AND

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:44.518
SO IF WE'RE RELYING SIMPLY ON-

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:47.288
DATA FROM THE EMPLOYER. AT NO.

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.523
I AM NOT SUGGESTING THESE MAY

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:51.559
BE REALLY I REALLY I HATE TO DO

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.660
THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THESE

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:53.928
EMPLOYERS I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:57.598
ANYTHING WE HAVE NO REASON. TO

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:58.933
SUGGEST OTHERWISE BUT- GIVEN-

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.601
HOW WE USUALLY DO REPORTS

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.103
PERHAPS PERHAPS THIS IS MORE OF

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:05.706
A- AND I THINK ACTUALLY I COULD

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:06.540
BE WRONG BUT I MIGHT HAVE

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.709
REQUIRED THE REPORT FIVE YEARS

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:11.312
AGO IN APPROPRIATIONS- AND

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:12.847
PERHAPS THE REPORT SHOULD BE

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:14.949
BEING DONE BY OSHA AS WELL AS

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:15.716
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:17.651
LIKE KERN. COMMISSIONER DOESN'T

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:19.653
NORMALLY DO THESE REPORTS ALSO

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.156
IF THIS IS SO TIED INTO THE

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:25.126
COUNTY- EDUCATION OFFICE IT BE

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:27.461
INTERESTING OR IT WOULD IT

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.397
WOULD BE- THAT WOULD HELP US.

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:32.099
GUIDE THESE TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.435
TO NOTE THE STUDENTS- YOU KNOW

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.337
DID THE STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.339
HIGH SCHOOL IS THIS EXEMPTION I

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.508
AM OBVIOUSLY THAT. THE

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:44.612
SUPERINTENDENT IN THE COUNTY-

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:47.181
SUPPORTS IN AND PUSHES THIS AT

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.616
BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:50.251
OUTCOME OF STUDENTS BECAUSE

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:53.554
IT'S NOT SIMPLY LIKE. WAS THERE

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.922
ONE INJURY REPORTED YES WE

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:57.091
ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS GOES ARE

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.893
CHILD LABOR LAWS GO WALK BE

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.594
BEYOND HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHT

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:02.029
THERE THERE THE REASON WE HAVE

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:03.030
THEM IS BECAUSE CHILDREN SHOULD

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:05.866
BE CHILDREN. I'M NOT BE IT AND-

01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:07.501
NOT BECAUSE THEY WILLINGLY IF

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:09.603
YOU WILL WE ALSO THOSE OF US I

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.538
THINK THAT COME FROM THESE

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:11.739
BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND MORE

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:14.308
THAT THAT- WILLINGLY IS BECAUSE

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:15.943
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY THEBILLS

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.578
NOT A CHILL CHILD WANTS TO

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.914
SPEND TEN. HOURS A DAY ALL

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:23.317
SUMMER LONG IN A PACKING HOUSE-

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.686
SO I JUST I THINK DOES THIS GO

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:26.587
TO APPROPRIATE I BELIEVE THIS

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:28.255
DOES GET ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:29.457
SO MAYBE WE CAN TALK THROUGH

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.558
SOME OF THAT IN THERE BUT I

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:31.692
WANT YOU TO AT LEAST KNOW HOW

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:32.793
I'M THINKING AND I THINK IT'S

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.627
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:35.429
CONVERSATION IN PUBLIC. THIS IS

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:37.631
WHY I DON'T BELIEVE IN AND-

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:38.999
WEAKENING OUR CHILD LABOR LAWS

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.735
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE TO KNOW IS

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.137
SO EXTENSIVE TO FEEL

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:44.171
COMFORTABLE WITH SOMETHING LIKE

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.739
THIS BUT THAT NOW AND NOW IT'S

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:50.311
BECOMING YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:51.045
JUSTIFY. THAT'S ON. IF YOU LOOK

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:54.315
AT YES SIR A 100% IN IN THE-

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:55.883

THE SAME IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE IN

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.152
THE ROOM HERE TWO DAYS THAT YOU

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.920
HAVE ALWAYS ENGAGE SINCERELY.

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:02.356
AND ON THIS ISSUE- AND ON THE

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:06.994
ISSUE OF- O. T. NOT REQUIRED-

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:09.463
LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORT- AND

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.798
SOME ADDITIONAL STATISTICS THAT

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.533
YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED. WOULD BE

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.501
MORE THAN WILLING AND WOULD

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.269
WELCOME. FURTHER ENGAGEMENT AND

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:18.072
CONVERSATION SINCERELY ON- WHAT

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:18.706
SOME OF THOSE DATA POINTS COULD

01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:20.841
BE. I'M AN THANK YOU AS A

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.743
SENATOR I THINK THAT. IN SOME

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:25.713
IN PERSON. ASPECT OF THE REPORT

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:30.284
NOT JUST ONE AND THEN. I WOULD

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:30.918
SUGGEST IF IT'S BEING TOUTED AS

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:31.619
SOMETHING. FROM THE

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:32.853
SUPERINTENDENT ADDED THEN

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.921
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES I THINK

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:34.989
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:36.390
BE IMPORTANT AS WELL. I GOT

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:37.458
AROUND OUT ON BUT I KNOW THAT

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:38.926
THE SUMMER THEY ARE NO ONE TO

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:41.495
MAKE A COMMENT AND SO I'LL BE

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:42.463
BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. YES SIR.

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:43.764
CAME IN LATE I HOPE I DIDN'T

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:47.568
MISS. MISS TOO MUCH ON THIS. SO

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:49.670
YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS THEY'RE

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:50.771
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.273
ARE THEY LIVE IN AN AREA THAT

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.841
PROBABLY THIS IS. THE

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:57.378
PREDOMINANT. WAGE EARNING. JOBS

01:36:57.444 --> 01:37:00.581
THAT THEY CAN GET- AND IT'S

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.216
ALSO SOMETHING THAT ENABLES

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.185
THEM. IF THIS BILL WERE TO

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:06.554
PASS. ENABLES THEM TO WORK RAGE

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.989
SPELLS MUCH AS THEY WANT- TO BE

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.891
ABLE TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. SO

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.026
THAT HOPEFULLY WHEN THEY DO GO

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.694
TO SCHOOL IF THEY DO GRADUATE

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:14.662
AND THEY DO GO TO SCHOOL

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:15.629
ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:18.799
MONEY. TO DO THAT WITH- THERE

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:21.435
ARE TIMES IN. IN IN OUR LIVES.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.104
WHEN WE TURN THE SWITCH ON. AND

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:24.838
THAT MEANS WE MAKE AS MUCH

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.640
MONEY AS WE CAN. BECAUSE WE

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:29.176
HAVE BILLS TO PAY OR WE HAVE.

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.444
WE HAVE A LIFE TO TRY TO SET

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:32.513
UP. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:36.750
THIS IS THIS IS. ALLOWING THAT

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:37.585
NOT FORCING THEM TO DO THAT. I

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:41.889
CORRECT SO I MEAN IS THAT. THE

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:44.325
PROGRAM IS OPTIONAL RIGHT. AND

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:45.226
SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS
