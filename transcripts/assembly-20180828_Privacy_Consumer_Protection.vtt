MUCH AS SENATOR DR LET'S TURN TO

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:49.267 region:rollup2
SENATOR HERTZBERG.

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:51.369 region:rollup2
NOW HE WAS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:52.437 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY.

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:54.338 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:55.973 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED SUCH ADVOCATES AND

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:57.942 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:59.710 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROCESS.

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:01.979 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN UNIQUE FOR SERIES OF

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.949 region:rollup2
REASONS.

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:07.585 region:rollup2
ARM AND SO THE CORE OF THAT

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:08.986 region:rollup2
UNIQUENESS WAS.

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:11.589 region:rollup2
TOO WAS TO BIT BAKIN THIS

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:13.124 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK BUT TIME.

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.058 region:rollup2
TO THINK THROUGH.

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:15.960 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:17.662 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.530 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A YEAR BEFORE YOUR

00:43:17.662 --> 00:43:20.565 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO REALLY DESCRIBE

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.166 region:rollup2
THIS AND ANALYZE THIS AND OF

00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:23.534 region:rollup2
COURSE.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:25.970 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND ALL OF US YOU

TO PUT BELTS AND SUSPENDERS AS

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:44.055 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:44.689 region:rollup2

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:27.911 region:rollup2
I RECOGNIZE THAT THE TIMING.

00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:29.346 region:rollup2
OF THE BILLS WAS OUT OF OUR

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.681 region:rollup2
CONTROL ON THE FIRST BILL I KNOW

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:32.282 region:rollup2
YOU WORK VERY HARD ON AND THE

00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:33.550 region:rollup2
TIMING WAS VERY SHORT ON THAT IN

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:35.386 region:rollup2
THIS ONE I REALIZE THAT WE'RE

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.487 region:rollup2
UNDER TIME PRESSURE JUST BECAUSE

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:37.287 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME LEFT

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.789 region:rollup2
CONCESSIONS SO.

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:41.625 region:rollup2
NORMALLY LATEAMENDMENTS AND

00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:42.760 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT CASE --

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:44.261 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS WHAT WE

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.095 region:rollup2
HAD TO DO AND I'M GLAD THAT

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.630 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING THIS ACTION THIS

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:47.731 region:rollup2
YEAR INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR NEXT

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.732 region:rollup2
YEAR ALTHOUGH I'M SURE NEXT YEAR

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:50.267 region:rollup2
WILL BE HAVING.

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:52.169 region:rollup2
MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS.

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:53.871 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO HAVE.

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:55.239 region:rollup2
BRIEF CONVERSATION THOUGH ABOUT

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:56.940 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:58.609 region:rollup2
THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.944 region:rollup2
BILL AND THAT'S REMOVING.

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:02.413 region:rollup2
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S A PLACE

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:04.748 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIMACY OF THE RIGHT OF

00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:05.749 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ACTION --

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:07.084 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE A OF ROBUST

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:08.285 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION IN THE ORIGINAL BILL

00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:08.886 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW THAT THERE

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.554 region:rollup2
WAS --

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:11.121 region:rollup2
STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:12.356 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:13.991 region:rollup2
REACHED.

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:15.859 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:17.194 region:rollup2
HAD PRIMACY AND I HAD THE

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.328 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO PROSECUTE

00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:19.797 region:rollup2
VIOLATORS.

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:21.465 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:22.366 region:rollup2
ACTION COULD BE EXERCISED IN SO

00:53:21.465 --> 00:53:24.001 region:rollup2
I WONDER IF YOU COULD WALK ME

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:25.769 region:rollup2
THROUGH JUST FOR A MINUTE THE

00:53:24.001 --> 00:53:29.773 region:rollup2
REASONING BEHIND REMOVING THAT

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:30.808 region:rollup2
AND THIS RECENT AMENDMENT.

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:31.875 region:rollup2
TRAINED JOURNALISTS OF THE

00:53:30.808 --> 00:53:33.077 region:rollup2
OPINION THAT HE IS NOT A

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:35.045 region:rollup2
REGULATOR.

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:38.982 region:rollup2
THAT HE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:41.819 region:rollup2
OFFICER AND FELT THAT ON WHAT WE

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:44.254 region:rollup2
WERE DOING BY VIRTUE OF CREATING

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:45.589 region:rollup2
THIS NEW PROCESS WHEREBY HE HAD

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:47.324 region:rollup2
TO REVIEW EVERY CLAIM.

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:48.258 region:rollup2
NOT AND WE WE INUNDATE HIS

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:49.660 region:rollup2
OFFICE WITH EVERYTHING UNDER THE

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.727 region:rollup2
SUN PROJECT IN THE THIRTY DAY

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.229 region:rollup2
DEADLINE.

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.796 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IT WE LITERALLY TURN

00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:54.798 region:rollup2
HIM IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:56.734 region:rollup2
COMMISSION REGULATOR AND HE FELT

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:58.168 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WASN'T REALLY THE

00:53:56.734 --> 00:54:00.738 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ROLE.

00:53:58.168 --> 00:54:04.007 region:rollup2
AND ANSWER CAME FROM.

00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:04.641 region:rollup2
OKAY I I CAN WE TALK ABOUT IS A

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW IT'S HITS

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.577 region:rollup2
--

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:08.045 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT UNIQUE IN THIS BILL HE

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:10.247 region:rollup2
HAS THAT RIGHT IN --

00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:11.715 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS THAT THE STATE HAS

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:13.717 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED REGULATION OVER.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:15.052 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO TAKE ACTION AND YOU

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:16.487 region:rollup2
KNOW HE CAN CHOOSE WHETHER NOT

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:18.589 region:rollup2
TO EXERCISE IT AND FUTURE

00:54:16.487 --> 00:54:19.890 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MAY MAY OR

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:20.124 region:rollup2
MAY NOT SHARE HIS VIEW POINT ON

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.892 region:rollup2
IT SO.

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:24.161 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE THE HARM

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:25.863 region:rollup2
WAS IN LEAVING THAT END BECAUSE

00:54:24.161 --> 00:54:26.930 region:rollup2
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS NOTHING.

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:29.600 region:rollup2
AND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:31.335 region:rollup2
STILL WHICH SO I DON'T KNOW WHY

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.736 region:rollup2
WE WERE TAKING THAT OUT.

00:54:31.335 --> 00:54:33.937 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT I

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:35.372 region:rollup2
THINK CERTAINLY THESE AMENDMENTS

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:37.774 region:rollup2
DO FAR MORE.

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:40.110 region:rollup2
GOOD THAN HARM I AM HOPEFUL THAT

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:41.678 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR AS WE HAVE SUBSEQUENT

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:43.647 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW FURTHER

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:45.315 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS TO THIS --

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:46.483 region:rollup2
WE CAN WE CAN INCLUDE THE

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:47.751 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO MAKE

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:49.019 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE FINE TUNE AT A TO

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:50.154 region:rollup2
HONOR THE SPIRIT OF THE

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.421 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE THAT WAS YOU KNOW.

00:54:50.154 --> 00:55:02.065 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY WAS A BIG PART OF

00:54:51.421 --> 00:55:02.699 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION ROW KNOWS THAT

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.333 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN KNOWS THAT HE KNOWS A

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:04.001 region:rollup2
BIG ISSUE ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
HOW TO PUT THE AG IN THIS THING

00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:05.269 region:rollup2
BUT QUITE FRANKLY WHEN HAVING

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:05.669 region:rollup2
THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE DEBATING

00:55:05.269 --> 00:55:06.236 region:rollup2
WITH HIS OFFICE.

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:06.837 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TRYING TO YOU KNOW

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:07.437 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT THE

00:55:06.837 --> 00:55:08.338 region:rollup2
PROPONENT MR MCTAGGART WOULD

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.873 region:rollup2
AGREE TO THAT WOULD GET TO THE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:11.475 region:rollup2
VERY ESSENCE OF AND I THINK THE

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:13.076 region:rollup2
NUB OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:14.478 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF PRE REVIEW.

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.779 region:rollup2
SO THINGS ARE AUTOMATICALLY

00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:17.548 region:rollup2
LITIGATED AND THERE WAS SOME

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:19.316 region:rollup2
PROCESS BUT I DO THINK THAT IT

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:20.317 region:rollup2
AS WE FOCUS ON IT NEXT YEAR IF

00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:22.119 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HELP US ON THAT HELP

00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:23.387 region:rollup2
SQUAD THAT COME WITH AN IDEA

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:23.954 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO THERE IS

00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:24.955 region:rollup2
SOME ESSENCE TO WHAT YOU'RE

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:27.324 region:rollup2
SAYING.

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:27.825 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRYING TO AVOID EVERYTHING
