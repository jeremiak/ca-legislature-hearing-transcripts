IN ORDER FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT ENROLLED AT LEAST HALF TIME TO APPLY FOR CAL FRESH FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THEY MEET CRTAIN EXEMPTIONS ONE QUALIFYING CRITERIA BEING. PARTICIPATION IN WORK STUDY. CURRENTLY MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSI UTILIZE DIFFERENT FORMS FOR THE SAME STUDIO ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PURPOSE WHICH MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR COUNTY STAFF WHO PROCESS CAL FLAT CALIBRATION. APPLICATIONS TO KNOW CONCLUSIVELY WHICH STUDENTS MAY QUALIFY FOR ANY ELIGIBILITY EXEMPTION SB TEN SEVENTY THREE WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY. WITH OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES TO CREATE STANDARD A STANDARD FORM THAT STUDENTS CAN TAKE TO THE CALLIE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS STANDARDIZE IN THIS PROCESS ACROSS COUNTIES. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY NO AND AND SERVICES. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ALEX. ALEX FROM -- REPRESENTING -- YOLO COUNTY. HELLO MY NAME IS NOLAN SULLIVAN I'M A BRANCH DIRECTOR FOR YOU'LL COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- I OVERSEE THE COUNTIES CAL FIRST PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY -- YOLO COUNTY SURPRISINGLY HAS THE LARGEST STUDENT OVERALL EIGHT COUNTIES WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS AND YOLO. THAN MOST OTHER COUNTIES SO WE'RE VERY VERY FOCUSED ON UC DAVIS IN PARTICULAR -- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH STUDENTS APPLYING FOR CALIFORNIA SHOES THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY MEET. AN EXEMPTION SO IF THEY DON'T MEET EXEMPTION THEY CAN'T EVEN APPLY. ONE OF THE MORE COMMON EXEMPTIONS IS WORK STUDY SO -- THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY IS -- TO ASKED TO PUT THIS BILL FORWARD -- TO PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE COLLEGE STUDENTS. FIFTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY COULD BE WORK STUDY ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- OF THOSE -- FIFTEEN THREE THIRTY TWELVE HUNDRED OR SO ACTUALLY RECEIVE WORK STUDY SO THERE'S A HUGE POOL OF POSSIBILITY ELIGIBLE COW FRESH. STUDENTS ON CAMPUS THE PROBLEM IS THE STUDENTS OFTENTIMES GET DIFFERENT FORMS DIFFERENT NOTICES DIFFERENT EMAILS -- OR DIFFERENT ALERTS FROM THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES IN THE DON'T KNOW THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE CAL FRESH SO BY PUSHING THIS BILL FORWARD. OR EMPOWERING STUDENTS TO BE NOTIFIED OF THEIR POSSIBLE WORLDS BOUTIQUE FOR CALIFORNIA -- AND HELPING GET MORE FOOD ON CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. THANK YOU ALEX TANGO X. WITH THE CHARACTERS OFFICE IN YOLO COUNTY HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY FOR US WE APPRECIATE CENTER DODD AND OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AS KNOWN ARTICULATED -- NGUY CAMPUSES. OF IMPORTANT ISSUE STATEWIDE PARTICULAR SO AND YOLO COUNTY AND WE THINK THIS WOULD BE A SIMPLE TOOL TO STERILIZE PROCESS STREAMLINED IT BOTH FOR UNIVERSITIES AND FOR COUNTY -- WHAT ARE WELFARE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS -- AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT. OKAY IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- IF SO PLEASE COME TO THE STANDING MICROPHONE AND STATE YOUR NAME A WHAT ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT OF ANY AND YOUR POSITION OF SUPPORT. CARLY SINGLE WITH THE FOOD BANK OF CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO IN STRONG SUPPORT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF HEALTH FRESH OUT REACH WORKERS WHO GO TO CAMPUS IS TO TRY AND HELP STUDENTS APPLY FOR CALL FRESH. AND THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICULAR VERY COMPLICATED AND ANYTHING THAT COUNTY CAN DO TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO STUDENTS WILL BE A GREAT BENEFIT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY'S UNDERLING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WERE IN SUPPORT. REVENUE EVERYBODY PARTIAL HISTORY WITH THE UC SAN ASSOCIATION WHEN SUPPORT. HI DOES BARTOLO WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON KEVIN AS THE COLDEST CALIFORNIA FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. JUSTIN SO MIKE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AT THIS TIME WE ARE RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT TO OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AT THEIR NEXT MEETING. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. IF SO PEASE COME TO THE STANDING MIKE AND SIMPLY STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION. AND YOUR POSITION IN OPPOSITION. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMITTEE FOR SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR DOT -- FOR BRING BRING UP THIS AND PROVIDES WHAT THE CLARIFY AND ASSEMBLY -- THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE BENEFIT THE STANDARDIZED FORM. BUT I WAS JUST COULD FIND FOR THE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED FOR IS THE MAIN ISSUE THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ELIGIBILITY STAFF TO DO IS IT ABOUT WHERE IN THIS OF STUDENTS THAT THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR A CAL FRESH AYE. AYE IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE PLAY IS I I JUST CLARIFY OR MAYBE IT'S BOTH BUT I JUST TRY -- SO CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAT FOR BY -- I ALSO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE OUR RATE LIMITING STATUS WHAT WHICH WHICH PART IS THE ISSUES THAT THAT MAINLY THE AWARENESS ARTS ALSO THE ELIGIBILITY SIDE FOR THE COUNTY TRYING TO FIGUREOUT THIS PERSON QUALIFY. A GREAT QUESTION I I WOULD SAY IT'S BOTH FOR THE STUDENT AND THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER AND SO. THE CALPERS PROGAM IS BASED ON USDA REGULATIONS OF THE STATE HAS TO INTERPRET THAT REGULATION AND THEN IN TURN PASS THAT INTERPRETATION DOWN TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SO. THERE'S OFTENTIMES MA'AM BEAUTY THERE THEN YOU FACTOR IN HUNDREDS OF OF COLLEGES THAT ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL AID OFFICE WITH A DIFFERENT FORM A DIFFERENT DOCUMENT. AND THEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. WHO HAVE TO GET THAT FORMER DOCUMENT WHICHEVER ONE THAT IS THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE USES BRING THAT TO THEIR CAL FRESH WORKER FROM THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES? THERE'S JUST AND AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF AMBIGUITY THERE AND SO IDEALLY WHAT THIS WILL HELP IS THE STUDENT WILL SAY HEY STUDENT GO GET FORM. AB BUT WHATEVER AND THEN THE STUDENT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO GET AND THEN FOR THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER WHICH THERE'S THOUSANDS OF IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S REALLY CLEAR THEM TO THAT YOU NEED FORM ACTS VERSUS -- A MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE GET OKAY SEES YOU SEE THAT DEBORAH PROBABLY THAT THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE OF PROVIDE THE FORMS ARE SOME COULD NOT OFFICE WITH RIDE THE FORM WHICH THEN THE STUDENT COULD USE TO TAKE THAT I WOULD REALLY WORKERS WHO CAN. YES SIR EXACTLY THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE AIR NAY OKAY YEAH EXACTLY FANTASTIC OKAY WE'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU INSERTS. THIS HEARTENING THAT WE HAVE TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO SCHOOL. ARE SO FOOD AND SECURE -- BUT THAT BEING SAID -- I'M WONDERING I ABOUT THE CAL FRESH PROGRAM VERSUS FOOD BANKS THAT I KNOW ARE -- SHOWING UP IN SPROUTING UP ON VARIOUS CAMPUSES TODAY -- THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED AT STUDENTS WHO WERE ON FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS IS THAT CORRECT. NOT NOT IN PARTICULAR SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN FINANCIALLY TO BE ON CAL FOR ACTUALLY YOU HAVE TO MEET AN EXEMPTION ON THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE DIFFERENT EXEMPTIONS FOR A COLLEGE STUDENT TO APPLY. SOME OF THE MORE COMMON EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE -- YOU'RE WORKING OVER TWENTY HOURS A WEEK WHICH IS KIND OF UNUSUAL FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS -- WORK STUDY COULD BE ONE CAL YOU HAVE A CHILD WHICH IS ANOTHER COMMON ONE THERE'S A COUPLE SMALL OFFBEAT. MORE LIKELY THAN NOT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ON FINANCIALLY TO SOME SHAPE OR FORM BUT IT'S NOT OF COLLUSION OR A A GATE KEEPING FACTORS CHOI ASSET BECAUSE I WONDER WHETHER. THIS -- WHETHER IT'S CONSISTENT OR NOT WITH THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION TO ALSO -- MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS -- THAT THERE ARE FOOD BANKS AT THESE DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAT AT A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. THAT MAY NOT. REQUIRE THE THE THE CAL FOR A SHOULD YOU KNOW THE FAIRLY EXTENSIVE. THE CRITERIA THAT EXISTS TO TO QUALIFY UNDER CAL FRESH -- IS THERE ANY REASON THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE SORT OF ONE OUT REACH ONE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS WHETHER THEY ARE. GOOD THEY QUALIFY FOR CAL FRAZIER MY QUALIFY FOR FOOD BANKS. TO TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT FOOD IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WANT STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO EAT. AND TO BE ABLE TO EAT HOPEFULLY IN A HEALTHY WAY WELL THEIR STUDENTS LEARNING. YOU KNOW THE THE TASKS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THEIR MARK ECONOMIC BASE IN THE FUTURE -- COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT -- I THINK ACTUALLY IN THE BILL ANALYSIS TO THERE IS A SECTION IT CITES FOODS FOOD BANKS ON CAMPUS AS WELL WHICH IS A SAD FACT AS YOU POINTED OUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION -- CAL FRESH ALSO HAS SOME LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF WHO CAN APPLY SO I I DO CERTAINLY AGREE HUNGER ON CAMPUS IS A HUGE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S IT'S AN EPIDEMIC ACROSS THE U. S. -- THERE WAS SOME WORK DONE LAST YEAR SOME REALLY ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWENTY FOUR TO FOURTEEN THAT ACTUALLY DID A VERY SIMILAR THING WITH CAL GRANT AND HAD DIFFERENT CAMPUSES NOTIFY -- STUDENTS IF THEY'RE ON CAL GRANT AS AN EXEMPTION AND SO AS PART OF THIS AS WELL AND IT'S PART OF THE THE BILL TO CENTER DOT IS PROPOSING. OUR TALKING BUT BRING THIS TO A WORKER FOR COMMUNITY TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN ONE THING TO SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM -- SNAP IS THE FEDERAL TERM FOR FOR CAL FRESH IT'S A SUPPLEMENT NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO CAL FRESH IS BY NO MEANS MEANT TO USE FOR FILL ALL OF YOUR FOOD NEED THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL. PIECE SO I THINK THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO KIND OF WE'VE ALL THOSE WEBS AND PULL ALL THOSE PIECES TOGETHER -- THE THE MORE WE CAN COMBAT THIS ISSUE ON CAMPUSES AND THAT SORT OF MY BOTTOM LINE IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN. DO THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM SO THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THERE WHICH ONE OF SIXTEEN PROGRAMS THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR IN THAT. THEY CAN JUST GO TO ONE PLACE FIND OUT WHERE THEY CAN GET THAT FOOD THEY NEED AND BE ABLE -- TO ACCESS. EXCEPT FOR WHETHER STUDENTS IS THAT. BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT. LEVELS OF BUREAUCRACY. UNREALISTIC CHORUSES SOMETHING YOU'RE WORKING TOWARDS. I THINK IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION I THINK OF THAT CAME FROM FROM SOMEBODY THAT. IT'S COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY ERA YOU SEASONS YES YOU COULD WORK ON SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. THE LEGISLATION WE'VE SEEN PROBABLY OF THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS HAS CERTAINLY MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT AS LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF KEEP BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP IN AND MISSED CENTER DOT BRINGS THIS ISSUE OF I THINK WE'RE MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT FACT. AND IDEALLY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A CENTRAL HUB OF INFORMATION THE JUST TARGETS HOW DO WE COMBAT HUNGER ON CAMPUS. AND BRING ALL THOSE TOOLS IN -- I DON'T THE HEADING THAT DIRECTION IF IT'S POSSIBLE WOULD SEEM TO MAKE SENSE I I'M ASSUMING HE WOULD HAVE. DONE THAT IF IT WERE. POSSIBLE AND IT MIGHT NOT BE BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO STREAMLINE THIS I MEAN. IT JUST SEEMS SO CRAZY THAT WE'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FED. HEY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CENTERS ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS A CHILD OF A MODEST INCOME FAMILY AND GOING TO SCHOOL -- WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO BUY FOOD AND YOU LEARN TO ADAPT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES YOU KNOW YOU. KRAFT MACARONI AND CHEESE ATOP RAHMAN YOU GOT TO GET THE CALORIES SOMEPLACE AND ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE NUTRITION -- IS GONNA REFLECTING YOUR ABILITY. TO TO STUDY -- SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING TIS FORWARD IN THE HOMOGENEOUS EFFORTS WITH BARACK BUREAUCRATIC FORMS TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE -- GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE. COURSES VERY TROUBLING IS WE'VE. ALL BEEN -- HEARING ABOUT. SO MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- LIVING IN THE CARS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE HOMELESS. AND THEY'RE ONLY -- ESCAPE IF YOU WILL FROM THE POVERTY SITUATION THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN IS. TO GET AN EDUCATION WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW THEM TO GET A JOB [inaudible] SO. ON A LOT OF OUR UC CAMPUSES WERE RIGHT WENT -- CAL STATE EVEN ON A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY HAVE FOOD SERVICES THERE -- UCLA YOU KNOW YOU COULD LOWER THE DORMS AND FOR A FEE YOU CAN GO TO THE CAFETERIA AND SO. ARE THESE STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR COVERAGE OF THE ABLE TO REDEEM THAT BENEFIT FOR SOME OF THE ORGANIZED FOOD SERVICES THAT EXIST ON OUR UC CAMPUSES AND CAL STATE CAMPUSES. AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW TAKING THE BENEFIT GOING OFF CAMPUS TO GET FOOD COME TO GET A RIGHT THERE IS A ONE STOP SHOP. BUT THAT THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION -- SO FEDERAL REGULATION ULTIMATELY DRIVES CAL FOR ASH IN IN CALIFORNIANS A ONE OF THE PRECLUSION FROM CAL FIRST WHICH IS SORT OF SHOCKING IS THAT IF YOU'RE ON A MEAL PLAN. SO TYPICALLY A MEAL PLAN WILL PRECLUDE YOU FROM CAL FOR US WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS SO TO SOME EXTENT. WITH THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER IS NO -- TO TWO OTHER EXTEND SO THERE ARE CAMPUSES ON CAMPUS. I DAVIS IS ONE OF THOSE CAMPUSES WHICH IS PHENOMENAL SO I THE EBT CARD IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS BASICALLY A DEBIT CARD THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR FOOD BEEN RIGHT IT'S ON IT'S IT'S NICE IT'S DISCREET IT'S EASY TO USE JUST LIKE. OUR STANDARD DEBIT CARD -- IN AGAIN IN THE BILL ANALYSIS THERE IS A SECTION THE TALK ABOUT UNITY ON CAMPUS WHICH IS AN AMAZING THING I THINK THE MORE THE CAMPUS IS EMBRACE EBT. YOU CAN USE IT IN THEIR THEIR IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CONVENIENCE STORE ON CAMPUS OR THE CAFETERIA THE OTHER SPOTS. ARE THE EASIER THE ACCESS IS FOR FOR STUDENTS TO USE THOSE BENEFITS THEY'RE AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WERE OFTEN TIMES THE THE FEDERAL REGULATION -- DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE TONS OF SENSE YEAH LOCALLY IT IN SO MANY THINGS BUT BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS THERE'S AND THERE'S SIDE RATS AND I'M IS THERE CHANGING. I THINK ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO ENCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF AB T. ACCEPTANCE WHEREVER IS A GREAT THING BECAUSE THAT'S FOOD ACCESS AT THE ABILITY OF OF PEOPLE TO USE THEIR BENEFITS AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN THE HEART OF DAVIS UC DAVIS CAMPUS IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GET. ALL THE WAY TO THE NEAREST STORE RESTAURANT ETCETERA ETCETERA AND SO IF YOU'RE RUNNING BETWEEN CLASSES YOU NEED LUNCH -- I DO THINK TO SOME EXTENT CAMPUSES EMBRACING THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING AND THAT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN BUT I I KNOW WE CAN ALL -- ENCOURAGE CAMPUSES OUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS TO KIND OF FOLLOW SUIT AND EXPLORE AB T. ON CAMPUS. SO -- I'M SURE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A MICRO MANAGE EVERY BE THE BENEFIT. OF COURSE THEY CAN DO SOME ANALYSIS AND I FIND IT SHOCKING AS WELL AS YOU DO THAT -- MEAL PLANS WOULD BE EXCLUDED WHEN AS IT'S SO CONVENIENT IS ACTING VERY COST EFFECTIVE FOR THEM TO UTILIZE THAT -- DO YOU USE. DO YOU SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY -- ENFORCING THAT -- OR SHOULD BE -- THINK WE SHOULD URGE SOME OF OUR FEDERAL LEGISLATORS THIS I MEAN HUNGER IN SCHOOLS OF IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE REMEMBER GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE GETTING THE PROPER NUTRITION SO THEY CAN. GET THEIR CAREERS AND STUDY WITH -- ANOTHER FUEL IN THE BRAIN TO TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS SO -- I WANT TO BELABOR THIS BUDGET I FIND IT VERY SHOCKING THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE BILL FANS AND I COULD TAKE MY CONGRESS WAS GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WRONG. AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED AT THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN. EMBRACE IT AT THE AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR FOR THESE GREAT KIDS THAT ARE JUST LOOKING. FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES INTO AGAIN SENATOR DON. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRAND IS FOR CENTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE PER SHEET THE RECOMMENDATIONS BILLS I INDICATED EARLIER WHAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THOSE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. SO THERE WAS A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL ARE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RETIRED FBI HER TITLE AYE STONE AYE STONE AYE BELL. BELL AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE PAN HI AND I WINNER [inaudible] WIENER AYE [inaudible] SIX SIX VOTES AT THE BILL IS OUT. BUT MEDICARE AND MEMBERS. THE NEXT AUTHOR WE HAVE A SENATOR SKINNER. YOU HAVE SENATOR SKINNER TO PRESENT SB. TWO THREE FOUR WELCOME TO SENATOR SKINNER AND TO YOUR WITNESSES WESSEL WITNESSES KEEP THEIR TESTIMONY TO TWO TO THREE MINUTES. BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY BILL WHICH YOU'RE HEARING RIGHT OUT SB. TWO THIRTY FOUR BASICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT. WE HAVE A SERIOUS. SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE PRICES OF CHILD CARE HAS GROWN SO ASTRONOMICALLY. AND LICENSED CHILDCARE CURRENTLY IS ONLY AVAILABLE 423% OF THE CHILDREN WITH WORKING PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS RECOGNIZES THAT FAMILY OPERATED HOME DAYCARE -- IS A OFTEN A FAR MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION. THAN OTHER FORMS OF CHILDCARE. END. IN THIS ECONOMY COULD BE EXPANDED. SO WHAT IT SB TWO THIRTY FOUR DOES IS. AMEND OUR STATUTE SO THAT WE WOULD TREAT THE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL AND LARGE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES LARGE BEING FOR NO MORE THAN FOURTEEN CHILDREN. THE SAME. AND CLEAR FIGHT THAT CHILD CARE OF THIS SORT WOULD BE ALLOWED IN APARTMENTS OR CONDOMINIUMS. AND TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES INFORM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OF THEIR RIGHTS OR THAT ALREADY EXIST UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND SO WITH ME TO PRESENT. OUR LAURIE FOR FURTHER SPEND FELT FROM THE TRUCK YOU'RE LAWCENTER AND TANYA MCMILLAN WHO IS A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL NINETY NINE AND ALSO. PART OF THE CHILD CARE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. SO -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER I SHARE A HEARING AND EDUCATING CHILDREN SO THAT THEY HAVE A GREAT START IN LIFE. I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU ABOUT SB TWO THREE FOUR AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WHAT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE RIGHT AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER TO OPERATE A FAMILY CHILDCARE IN A HOME THAT I RAN? WITHOUT HASSLE OR DISCRIMINATION OFTEN COMES WITH THE PROCESS OF BEING THREATENING AND EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING -- I LOST MY HOME DURING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GRANT. US SINCE THEN I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH LANDLORDS WHO REQUIRE THREE TIMES THE DEPOSIT -- JUST BECAUSE I CARE FOR CHILDREN IN MY HOME DESPITE WE HAVE IN HOME CARE LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT WOULD PROTECT THEM FROM LIABILITY. I FOUND THAT RENTAL APPLICATIONS WERE EITHER DENIED OR REVOKED THE MINUTE I TOLD THEM. IN THE MINUTE I TOLD POTENTIAL LANDLORD THE I HAD A HOME BASED FAMILY CHILDCARE. I SAW FOR SALE FIND TO BE PLACED ON A HOME THAT I WAS RANTING TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THE OWNER NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION ON SELLING HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WOULD VACATE THE PROPERTY. IN THE EASIEST POSSIBLE WAY. SO I HAD TO MOVE THREE TIMES SINCE I LOST MY HOME AND WITH EACH MOVE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH IT. TRYING TO FIND A HOME THAT'S STILL IN MY NAME IT WILL CONTINUE TO TO ACCESS THE SERVICES. THAT I PROVIDE FIRE INSPECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED LICENSING -- HAVING TO COME TO MY HOME AND AND DEMI'S SAFE. THERE'S A GAP IN CARE WHICH MEANS A LOSS IN WAGES FOR ME AND A LOSS AND CARE FOR THE FAMILIES BECAUSE I CAN'T READ OPEN MY NEW CHILD CARE UNTIL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT -- LIES AND COMES IN AND SAYS IT'S OKAY AND IT MEANS INSTABILITY FOR OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND TEMPORARY CARE UNTIL I CAN GET BACK UP AND RUNNING. SEOUL WHILE RENTING IS ALREADY A DAUNTING TASK FOR MANY OF US AS WE FIND SKYROCKETING RENTS ON AFFORDABLE. FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IT CREATES A WHOLE EXTRA LEVEL OF ANXIETY. MY ABILITY TO RUN MY BUSINESS EARN A LIVING AND PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH THE NEEDED CARE INTRICATELY TIED TO WHERE I LIVE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK.

CUT BACK THEIR HOURS -- COBBLED TOGETHER ON RELIABLE SITUATIONS THAT LACK THE LIVING HOME ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY WANT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE FAMILY CHILD CARE CLOSE TO HOME IS AVAILABLE. IT WILL UPDATE PROTECTIONS FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PAST NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S FAMILIES. I'M SENATOR SKINNER ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE MEAN TENANTS OF THE BILL I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE ONE TENANT THAT REDUCES RED TAPE BY REQUIRING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT STREET LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE AT LARGE LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE IT'S A RESIDENTIAL USE A PROPERTY.

I DON'T KNOW AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER AND THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I HAVE TO GET BACK TO ABOUT. THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT. THROUGH THE PROGRESS OF THIS BILL THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO ENTERTAIN BECAUSE I THINK. IT COULD BE A A PLACE WHERE. WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE SENIOR CITIZENS THAT ARE LOOKING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WITHOUT. DURING THE BIG BROTHERS LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER TO MAKE LIFE MISERABLE FOR THEM SO -- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS OF THANKS AGAIN FOR PRESERVING THE BILL. ABOVE IT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU -- JUST A QUICK QUESTION THE IS THIS -- LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE ABILITY OF FAMILY DAY CARE HOMES IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES -- AND THE IS THAT ACCURATE THAT IT WILL. SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO OPEN A FACILITY IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THEY WILL NOW BE ABLE TO DO SO WHERE IS BEFORE THEY WERE NOT. WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE JURISDICTION THERE MANY JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WAS ALLOWED WAS ONE OF THOSE THE STATE LAW IS NOT CLEAR SO THERE WAS NO BLANKET. OF ELIMINATION NO BLANKET PROHIBITION ON APARTMENTS OR CONDOS FOR THAT MATTER BUT THERE WERE IT WAS IRREGULARLY APPLIED AND SOME JURORS SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNIFORMITY CORRECT. SO IF I MAY JUST ASK THIS QUESTION AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE. CHILD CARE IN ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS AND IF YOU'RE. WILLING TO PUT UP WITH FOURTEEN LITTLE ONES GOD BLESS YOU -- IT ONE SPACE BUT I WONDER IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES I I'M I'M JUST THINKING OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX WE WANT THESE KIDS HAVE A GREAT TIME WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY OUTSIDE RECREATION BE CHILDREN -- BUT I DO KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WORK SORT OF NONTRADITIONAL HOURS. AND SO IF THEY'RE TRYING TO SLEEP IT DURING THE DAY WHEN WE'VE GOT A CHILD CARE. OF FACILITY THERE DO THEY IF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ADDRESS THERE RIGHT TO THE QUITE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR OF THEIR APARTMENT FORCES YOU KNOW HAVING A ROBUST AREA FREEDOM LITTLE WANTS TO TO BE CHILDREN. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT MODIFY WHATSOEVER ANY STANDARDS AROUND. THE THERE'S A CORE OF ALLOCATIONS OF SPACE REQUIREMENTS PER CHILD THERE'S VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS SO THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER THAT. THOSE ARE STILL IN THE CODE SO YOU KNOW LET'S SAY YOU HAD. I'M JUST BEING HYPOTHETICAL HERE A THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT OR SOMETHING. NOT. YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A FOURTEEN EVEN IFWE PASS THIS LAW SO SO THOSE THINGS IT DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE LICENSE REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL -- STILL EXIST. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE ABILITY YOUR HOURS OF YOUR FACILITY ARE ALSO -- YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE IN IN GETTING YOUR PERMIT AND WE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING AROUND REQUIRING SAY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NO DON'T GET TO HAVE A SAY OVER. THE HOURS OF YOUR PERMITTED -- WHEN YOU HAVE THE -- FACILITY OPEN RIGHT SO CERTAINLY IN THOSE CASES WHERE -- THE THE APARTMENT COMPLEXES SUCH WHERE YOU WHERE YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO PROTECT ANY OF YOUR RESIDENT OF THE RESIDENTS FROM. POTENTIAL DISRUPTION YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE FACTORED I IMAGINE BY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- ADDITIONALLY -- WELL I A STATED THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR THE FOURTEEN THAT THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES WITH FOURTEEN CHILDREN TO BE TREATED THE SAME AS EIGHT ARE ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS DID MAKE A CORRECTION WHICH IS ACCURATE. WHICH I DID NOT -- GIVE THOUGH IT THAT DETAIL WHICH IS REALLY IT'S ALLOWING FOR FOR MORE CHILDREN. IT IS SO GOES TO TWELVE THE TWO ADDITIONAL UNDER THE EXISTING LAW WHICH WE DON'T CHANGE WOULD HAVE TO BE AFTER SCHOOL SO THEY WOULD NOT BE A FULL DAY. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AND THEN IF THERE'S ANY OTHER LEGAL POINT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE YES I ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAVE BOTH ISSUED GUIDANCE -- IT'S NOT IT'S BEEN IN STANDING FOR MANY YEARS THAT FAMILY CHILD CARE IS ALLOWED IN APARTMENTS AND CONDOS WE'RE CLEANING UP THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TO CLARIFY AND I AND LAKE -- SENATOR SKINNER SAID -- THE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHAT'S THE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN APARTMENTS AND CONDOS IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALSO THAT THERE'S MANY FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN APARTMENTS WHO ALSO NEED CHILDCARE CLOSE TO HOME. AND SO WE HAVE SIT CITIES THAT WE KNOW OF WHERE THEY BANNED FAMILY CHILD CARE FROM APARTMENTS FAMILIES WHO ARE LIVING IN APARTMENTS ARMENIANS DRIVE TO THE NEXT TOWN. TO GET CHILD CARE. IT UP I UNDERSTAND THE SAID. IT'S A BIT OF A WEIGHING PROCESS BECAUSE OF LET'S SAY I MANAGE YOUR OWN AN EIGHT UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING ND I KNOW THAT TWO OF THE PEOPLE IN MY UNITS ARE LET'S SEE NURSES. AND THEY WORK FROM ELEVEN PM TO SEVEN AM OR EIGHT AM -- AND THEY WANT TO COME HOME AND SLEEP ED IN THE SYSTEM THAT I'M CALM THE SITUATION -- ARE YOU INDICATING THAT THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE A POLICY DECISION THAT SAYS. THAT IF THERE'S A FAMILY DAYCARE CENTER IT CAN STILL OPERATE WITHIN THAT APARTMENT UNIT IN THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN ON TRADITIONAL HOURS ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT OR MOVE. AT A GET OFF. I'VE NEVER HAD THE GOOD THE MISFORTUNE I SHOULD SAY OF HAVING TO WORK THOSE HOURS BUT I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO AND I JUST WONDER WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OF THE PROPERTY MANAGER OR THE THE PROPERTY OWNER -- IN LAW TODAY BECAUSE IF WE'RE EXPANDING IT I JUST LIKE TO BE AWARE OF THAT OR WE JUST SIMPLY. CONFIRMING EXISTING OR EXPANDING EXISTING LAW ONLY TO THE EXTENT WERE INCREASING THE NUMBER CHILDREN IT'S REALLY DAY. THE AS WAS POINTED OUT IT'S REALLY MAKING A AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS ALREADY MADE THE CLARITY THAT. THERE YOU YOU TECHNICALLY ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THESE FAMILY CHILDCARE FACILITIES IN APARTMENTS. IT'S JUST THAT THEIR BY NOT HAVING IT REALLY IN STATUTE IT CAN BE -- SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CHOOSE TO ENTER PRODUCES CERTAIN WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE PROPERTY OWNERS MY ONLY QUESTION SO IT CAN TAKE THAT PERSON ONCE IN A UNIT? OF THE PARTIAL AND THEY'VE GOT TENANTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THERE. WHO ARE NONTRADITIONAL WORKERS AND -- YOU CREATE A CHILD CARE PROGRAM AND THE PEOPLE COME TO YOU AND SAY LOOK I WAS HERE FIRST I CAN'T SLEEP IT'S TOO NOISY WE GOT A BUNCH OF THE KIDS HERE NOW AND WILD THEY LOVE KIDS OR WHATEVER. THAT YOU KNOW WHO WHO'S. WHOSE GOD WHOSE OX GETS CORD HERE OR NOT. WELL I WILL SAY THAT THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO EVERY OTHER RESIDENT APPLIED TO FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS -- AND UNDER CURRENT LAW. PROPERTY MANAGERS CANNOT PROHIBIT. THEY USE OF THE OPERATION OF FAMILY CHILD CARE AND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. ALL THE ONES THAT WE WORK WITH REALLY WORK WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR NEEDS IF THEY KNOW THAT THEIR SOMEBODY HOME THAT SLEEPING BILL STEIGER KIDS HOME YOU KNOW STAGGER ACTIVITIES MORE QUIET ACTIVITIES DURING THE TIMES THAT PEOPLE SLEEP. OR YOU KNOW -- OUTSIDE SO FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND TINY CAN SPEAK MORE TO THIS -- THEY REALLY DO YOU WORK A LOT WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS TIM. CREATE A PEACEFUL LEAVING LIVING ENVIRONMENT. YEAH AND THEN WE SHARE SOMETHING TOO BECAUSE I KNOW AUTOMATICALLY PEOPLE WHEN WHEN WE SAY. CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT YOU AUTOMATICALLY THINK OF CRYING BABIES. I WAS THINKING OF LAUGHING KIDS OVER. NINE SO BUT THE SAME WAY THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN. LICENSING MANDATES THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THEY MANDATE HOW MANY EVENTS WITH TO HAVE ALSO AND I THINK EVERYBODY WHO BECAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS TWENTY FOUR YEARS. I WHEN I DECIDED TO DO THIS I WAS VERY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT. WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO DO AND I WHEN I STARTED BEFORE I BOUGHT MY HOME I DID LIVE IN A TOWN HOUSE? AND I HAVE. OF MY NEIGHBORS. THEY HAD CHILDREN. TO AND SO I REALIZED THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I WAS GETTING READY TO START THIS BUSINESS AND THEN I ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE WOULD BE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF NOISE. THAT WHEN I MOVED INTO THAT TOWNHOUSE THERE WERE -- IN MY LEASE. THERE WERE RULES THERE AND SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND SO. WE HAVE THE SAME RULES AS ANY OTHER TENANT [inaudible] BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE. AND I STAND BY THE FACT THAT BEFORE WE START DOING THIS BUSINESS WE'RE VERY VERY MUCH AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING READY TO DO AND WHAT THIS BUSINESS. BRINGS WITH IT AND I THINK I IN ALL MY YEARS ON ONLY KNOWN ONE HONESTLY ONE PROVIDER. WHO'S EVER HAD ANY KIND OF DISAGREEMENT OR COMPLAINTS. FROM HER NEIGHBORS BECAUSE OF CHILDREN SO. I'MON WELL I BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A FUNNY ANECDOTE TO USE BUT YOU KNOW WE NUMBER ONE IN. HOUSING POLICY WE DO NOT ALLOW FOR DISCRIMINATION AROUND AT THE RENTAL TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND WE DON'T PUT ANY LIMIT ON HOW MANY CHILDREN YOU MAY HAVE. AND IF YOU COULD -- MAY ALL MY NEIGHBORS SINCE I GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH -- EIGHT BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND WE WERE NOT QUIET. AND WE HAD A NEIGHBOR WHO WAS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN HE WAS A DRUMMER HE PRACTICED IN THE DAY. SO AND WE ARE ANOTHER NEIGHBOR WHO WAS -- YOU LIKE TO WELD AND I MEAN ANYWAY WE HAD A LOT OF NEIGHBORS THAT DID LOUD STUFF. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE WERE WORSE OR THEY WERE. BUT THEY OFF. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT JUST I WANT TO ANTICIPATE WHAT MIGHT BE. OF CONCERN AND CERTAINLY AGAIN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I HOPE THOSE KIDS ALL LAUGHING AND NOT COMING. CENTERS SCANNERS TODAY WE HAD. TEN YEAH I DON'T KNOW KNOWS NINE TOTAL I SAID EIGHT BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HAD I I HAVE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. OKAY. OKAY SO -- SO WE HAD TWELVE AND YEAH I KNOW I I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU PRICE WHILE WE GOT IN TROUBLE BUT BUT WE WORKED OUT THE THE PROBLEMS AND LAND USE ISSUES. YOU WANT TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT. A GOOD CHILD -- GOOD OPERATOR FAMILY DAYCARE WILL OPERATE IN A GOOD WAY THOUGH WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. LET'S SAY IT'S NOT A LAND USE ISSUE AS MUCH. IT'S MORE OF A MANAGEMENT ISSUE. THAT'S MY PLAN MY MOTHER AND DAD. WE'RE PRETTY GOOD MANAGERS. I WILL I WILL COMMON. YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW OKAY. S.. CENTER SKINNER PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CLOSE.
