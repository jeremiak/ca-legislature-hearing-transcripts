THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM JASON KENNEY OF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES SO SASHA WAS GOT WAS COUNTY FROM -- CALLOUSLY DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE ON IT AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST MY FRIEND POGGIBONSI THE CEO OF THAT CITY THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE G. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK TO US SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND JUST TODAY THE NONPROFIT QUARTERLY MAGAZINE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IT'S VERY TIMELY THE HEADLINE IS. COMMUNITY LAND TRUST COME OF AGE BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND WE THE LAND TRUST NETWORK REPRESENTS SEVERAL COMMUNITY LAND TRUST THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FROM SAN DIEGO TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HUMBLE COUNTY. COLLECTIVELY COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS ARE PROVIDED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES WITH OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PLANNED. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ASSETS THEY PROVIDED SINGLE FAMILY MULTI FAMILY LIMITED EQUITY CALL UPS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. URBAN AGRICULTURE AND WORKFORCE TRAINING. AS IT IS THIS. SELECT COMMITTEE RECOGNIZES. AFFORDABILITY AFFECTS MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHAT'S A WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO READ. EACH OF THE NUMBERS BUT TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LEFT HAND BARS AND THESE BARS HERE. THIS IS THE INCOME NEEDED TO AFFORD THE MEDIAN PRICED HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO. LOS ANGELES OXNARD THOUSAND OAKS CENTER OF SAN DIEGO CARLSBAD THIS IS A PROBLEM AND THESE ARE STE TYPICAL SALARIES -- FOR FOR FIREMEN FOR POLICE FOR TEACHERS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS. ALL CALIFORNIANS. HOW TO SEAL TEES? ADDRESSED PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING LADDER ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. COMMUNITY LAND TRUST ENHANCE MOBILITY FROM SUPPORT OF RENTAL TO MARKET OWNERSHIP. WE SORT OF TAKE THE BRIDGE FROM HOMELESSNESS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING TO MARKET RATE HOUSING. COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS GENERALLY PROVIDE HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE CONSTRUCT. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE MULTI FAMILY HOMES. WE ASSUME DE DISTRICT HOMES -- DENSITY BONUS HOMES INCLUSIONARY HOUSING UNITS AND STORE THEM. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE PRODUCTION OF LIMITED EQUITY CALL UPS AND OTHER FORMS OF RENTAL HOMES. WE ALSO PRESERVE AND PROTECT. EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OWNERSHIP PRESERVES CONTROL PERMANENTLY INTO THE FUTURE TO RESELL RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR GROUND LEASES. CAN PROVIDE STORAGE OF OF COMMUNITY ASSETS. CLT IS A LOT OF THEM STARTED BY ACQUIRING FORECLOSED HOMES AND WE HAVING THEM. AND PUTTING THEM INTO THE PERMANENT AFFORDABILITY OF PORTFOLIO. THE PLACING NEW AND EXISTING. DEED RESTRICTED HOMES WILL CONVERT THOSE DEED RESTRICTED ARE PROVISIONS THAT TYPICALLY EXPIRE AFTER PERIOD FORTY FIVE FIFTY YEARS. INTO PERMANENT AFFORDABILITY I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MINUTE -- SHIELDS IS ALSO PROVIDE OTHER SORTS OF SERVICES BUT THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS HOUSING. THE BASIC COMMUNITY LATIMES MODEL. IS DUE OWNERSHIP. THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST WILL ALWAYS RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND. THE BASIC MODEL IS THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST WILL. IMPROVE FOR CHOIR HOME CELL AT HOME SUBJECT TO NINETY NINE YOUR GROUND PLEASE. THAT PROVIDES PERPETUAL AFFORDABILITY THROUGH THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS. WE PROVIDE STEWARDSHIP WE REQUIRED HOME BUYERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND PROVIDE SUPPORT ANIMAL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IN JUST A A PREVIOUS AND SUBSEQUENT SLIDE. THERE'S ALSO COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION GENERALLY ONE THIRD OF THE BOARD FOR CMT'S COME FROM OWNERSHIP FROM THE OWNERS OF THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OHMS. AND A CHANCE TO BE A MORE EFFICIENT SOME CITIES AND OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING PROGRAMS -- IT MAY BE A ONE TIME SUBSIDY FOR PLANNED FOR EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDED BY SURPLUS PROPERTY. BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S NO OTHER FORM OF SUBSIDY. I'M LIKE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE WERE IN A RISING MARKET. GREATER AND GREATER SUBSIDY IS REQUIRED TO RETAIN THAT SAME LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY. AND ALSO I MENTIONED THE DEED RESTRICTED HOMES. I WOULD HAVE A TIME LIMIT. AND WITH WITH THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST MODEL IT'S A PERPETUAL COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP. JERRY LAI TRUSTED TYPICALLY FIVE OH ONE C. THREE SECOND BE STANDALONE SIMILAR TO THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. THEY CAN BE CREATURES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIKE YOU'RE BUYING COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OR MORE MORE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. WE THINK THIS IS A A REAL AREA FOR EXPLORING IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT BRINGS THE BEST OF BOTH MODELS TOGETHER. ON THERE SOME INFORMATION THERE SOME LINKS IN TERMS OF WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION. I MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STORAGE OF THE LAND TRUST -- YOU MOST OF OUR HOME BUYERS ARE A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS THROUGH THE FIRST. THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE FOURTH QUARTER THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST MORTGAGES WERE A TINY TINY FRACTION OF EVEN PRIME MORTGAGES IN TERMS OF SERVICE DELINQUENCIES ARE FORECLOSURES. THAT'S A FUNCTION OF THE STEWARDSHIP. SO ON TO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP LEGISLATION AND POLICIES TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OF COURSE REDUCING COSTS FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOME DEVELOPMENT AND I KNOW BUT A SUBSEQUENT. PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT STREAMLINING THE APPROVAL PROCESS. ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT -- PORT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT WAYS TO DO THAT. IS -- SB ONE NINETY SIX WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY. WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE WELFARE EXEMPTION DURING CONSTRUCTION FOR COMMUNITY LAND TRUST PROJECTS. MARTIN JOHN TO HELP REDUCE THE COST. ANOTHER ATTACK AREAS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL RESOURCES. FOR NONPROFIT PROVIDERS LIKE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. CAPACITY GRANTS OR FUNDS FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION SIMILAR TO THE PROP ONE AND CAL HOME -- PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY ARE GOING THROUGH THE DEREGULATION PHASE. AND OR TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO RAW MATERIALS AND THAT'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT SURPLUS PROPERTIES -- SURPLUS PROP PROPERTY IS A RAW MATERIAL FOR HOUSING YOU NEED PROPERTY TO BUILD A HOUSING. A COUPLE OF BILLS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS LEGISLATION ARE SB SIX TO PROVIDE A CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF AVAILABLE SURPLUS PROPERTIES. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INVENTORY IS SO WE KNOW. WHERE TO GO TO TRY TO FIND THOSE RESOURCES? ALSO THE PRIORITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES -- THERE THERE'S A B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT IS GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I THINK IS NOW WE ARE GOING TO THE SENATE. SO THINGS LIKE THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF OF HELPING COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS AND OTHER NON PROFITS GET ACCESS TO THE RAW MATERIAL. ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATION AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERS COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS EXPLICITLY. AS AN IMPORTANT PROVIDER OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOMES INCLUDING OWNERSHIP [INAUDIBLE] FOR EXAMPLE. IT MAY BE IMPORTANT IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE SPECIFICALLY AND DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS. WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF HOUSING SPONSOR. RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR -- AND I THINK IT WOULD HELP TO RECOGNIZE COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS. AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN PROVIDING EXPANDING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SUCH A NINE OF OF BABY. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT DOES PROVIDE. THAT A PRIORITY BE GIVEN IN TERMS OF A CONFLICT OF TWO PROPOSALS THAT ARE EQUAL. THE PRIORITY BE GIVEN TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ROOFS. OR THE DEEPEST INCOME LEVEL SERVED. THAT I THINK. ON INTENTIONALLY DISADVANTAGES LOW AND MODERATE OWNERSHIP. DUE TO THE DIFFERENT ECONOMICS AND THE FEASIBILITY OF OWNERSHIP PROJECTS. OWNERSHIP PROJECTS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO SUBSIDIES LIKE TAX CREDITS LIKE LOW INCOME RENTAL DOES. SO WE SHOULD JUST BE AWARE WHEN WE MAKE -- PROVISIONS LIKE THIS THAT WE DON'T INADVERTENTLY DISADVANTAGE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME OWNERSHIP PROJECTS. THANK YOU. NOW AND AGAIN THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ABOUT -- COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS THROUGH THE LINKS THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH REPRESENTATION VERY EFFICIENTLY DELIVERED A LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION ON THAT IT THANKS THAT STUFF -- THE REST OF THE PRESENTATIONS -- CAN YOU REPEAT THE ARTICLE CAME OUT TODAY YES WE GET THAT OUT TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S THE ON THE NONPROFIT QUARTERLY. AND IT JUST CAME OUT TODAY I JUST GOT THE ARTICLE TODAY AND IS COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS COME OF AGE. BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND WISH FOR A POLICY AGENDA. IT'S A VERY GOOD ARTICLE -- PROVIDING A SYNOPSIS OF THE COMMUNITY LANDFILLS MOVEMENT AND HOW THEY'VE GROWN AND REALLY BECOME A FORCE AND EXPANDING LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. HOUSING THAT'S QUITE THE TITLE. FOR THIS SESSION -- AND THEN FOR YOUR SECOND SIDE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WHEN I WAS REACTIVE THIS LOOKING AT LAST NIGHT IS THAT -- IN THE NORTHEAST -- IT'S FAIRLY NEW IN THE WEST COAST ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA SO IT TAKES SOME TIME I THINK FOR COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS CAN HELP. SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND ONE OF THEM ONE OF THE IDEA WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMITTEE LAND TRUST IT THERE'S THIS GREAT RECOGNITION THAT IT'S A WONDERFUL MODEL IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL THINGS. SO WE THINK THAT WE CAN JUST CREATE A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. TRANSFER ALL THE PROBLEMS TO THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST BUT NOT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THEM TO DO IT SO. THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH AND EXPAND THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA GET MORE COMMUNITIES INVOLVED. AND I WOULD SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR COMMUNITY LAND TRUST THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED JUST EACH YEAR IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS SO IT IS GROWING IN CALIFORNIA. IMPORTANT THE NEXT SLIDE IN TERMS OF THAT THAT THE INCOMING NEEDED PEACE I BECAUSE POSTED NECESSARILY MAKE IT OUT ON THE ON THIS ON THE GRAPH. THE FIRST OF IS DECEPTIVE IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE SAN DIEGO MIGHT BE A BARGAIN AND I'VE MADE RIGHT BY COMPARISON THE SAN FRANCISCO PROCESS TRUE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A GOAL COMFORTED HE'S GETTING IN TRYING TO FIND A PLACE ALLEN -- BUT THOSE THE ANNUAL INCOME NEED IT IS BASED ON A 10% DOWN PAYMENT THE GRAPH RIGHT OUT WILL WANT TO THE LEFT HAND COLUMN IS 10% DOWN PAYMENT THE ONE NEXT TO IT WHICH HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER INCOME REQUIREMENT IS A 3% DOWN PAYMENT. SO YOU'RE GIVING -- AND TO PUT TO THE PURCHASE OF A HOME RIGHT OKAY -- AND THEN I JUST LOVE THE HOUSING LADDER ON YOUR NEXT SLIDE AND IF WE CAN BRING THAT ONE UP BUT YOU KNOW I THINK OFTEN AND I THINK LEASE LOWS -- PRESENTATION LATER REALLY ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THEY ARE LATTER DOESN'T HAVE SLOTS -- IN THE MIDDLE ANY LONGER AND YOU HAVE A HUGE YAWNING GAP BETWEEN THE TOP AND A LOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER -- I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU KIND OF PAINT THAT PICTURE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO YOU SEE CONSTRUCTION IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S NOT TO SAY DIRECTLY BENEFITING THEN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THE FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH IS AGAIN SORT OF BILLION THAT MIDDLE SECTION FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. WITH REGARD TO THE TO THE FORMATION YOU MENTIONED THAT THE OF THE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IS RETAINED BY THE LAND TRUST. IS IT FAIR TO CALL THIS ALMOST LIKE A LIKE A IS A TRAILER PARK CAMINO MOBILE HOMES HAVE A BIT A STIGMA MILITANT -- TO IT'S IT'S A USE OF THE VEHICLE YOU KNOW FOR NO PUN INTENDED -- FOR FOR THE GROW THE WEALTH RIGHT IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT I WAS INTENDED TO GO WELL. NEVER OWN THE ACTUAL LAND RIGHT RIGHT SO HOW DOES SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM HOW DO YOU DAY BESIDES THE OBVIOUS TO BE ABLE TO GET A PRICE POINT THEY CAN AFFORD. HOW DOES THIS WORK FOR THEIR FAMILY TO BILL GENERATIONAL OFF THAT ALLOWS THEM TO YOU KNOW BE REALIZED? BETWEEN THE WERE TOLD RUSSIA EXCELLENT QUESTION. THE THE RESALE FORMULA CAN VERY FROM MY INTEREST IN ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY ELECTIONS MODEL IS ITS FLEXIBLE AND IT CAN BE ADAPTED TO LOCAL SITUATIONS. OF FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA IN THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY LAND TRUST THEIR RESALE FORMULAS TIED TO CHANGES IN ANY OF MY SO A FAMILY THE BUYS A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OHMS THROUGH THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. THEY THEY CAN SELL ANY TIME THEY WANT THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON WHEN THEY SELL. BUT IF IF THE TRUST HAD PRICE THE HOME SO WAS AFFORDABLE TO FOUNDING EARNING A HARPER 100% OF SAN DIEGO AREA MEDIAN INCOME. WHEN THEY GO TO SELL IT HAS TO BE AFFORDABLE TO A FAMILY AT THAT POINT IN TIME? EARNING A 100% OF THE AIRLINE SO WHATEVER CHANGE IN ANY OF MY IS THAT'S THE FIRST LEVEL OF EQUITY GROWTH THAT THEY HAVE -- IN ADDITION THEN I HAVE OWNERSHIP WHICH IS AT AND WE WILL ONLY PERMIT FIXED RATE THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGES SO THERE'S NO VARIABLE RATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO WE FIX THEIR HOUSING COSTS I'M LIKE RENTAL. AYE WEATHER CHARTS AND I'VE DONE THAT SHOW A COMPARISON BETWEEN. RENT EVEN IN THE WORLD EVEN DURING THE HOUSING CRISIS RENT GOES UP. RAMPING RANT IS NEGATIVE EQUITY. HERE. IS NOT THE SAME GROWTH IS IF YOU HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO BUY A HOME AND IT WAS LOW MARKET RATE HOME AND SO WHEN IT WAS FINE YEAH BUT YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RISK. OF BUYING ONE AT THE BEACON SELLING AND LOSING 50% OF YOUR EQUITY. SO IT IS SLOW BUT STEADY AND IT DOES PROVIDE FOR EQUITY GROW SEE OKAY SO THE EQUITY THAT IS K. DOES NOT PERTAIN BY THAT LAND TRUST IS RETAINED BY THE OWNER THAT'S RIGHT IF THEY WANT OKAY -- I WAS VERY HIGH LIKE THE PERPETUAL AFFORDABILITY PIECE OF THE MODEL -- FOR THOSE THAT WERE A LOT ABOUT RETAINING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE OFTEN INTERESTED IN BUILDING NEW SUBSIDIZE UNITS. BUT THE RETAINING AND AND AND ON DAHLE GOING TO PORTABILITY OF PROJECTS THAT THAT TIME OUT THIS THIS MODEL SOLVE THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TRY TO DO IS WORK WITH DEVELOPERS WHEN THEY HAVE INCLUSIONARY UNITS OR DEED RESTRICTED UNITS OR MUNICIPALITIES OR MANAGING. THOSE PROGRAMS WHEN ONE OF THOSE UNITS BECOMES AVAILABLE. PUT IT IN OUR OUR PORTFOLIO BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE THROUGH THE NINETY NINE YOUR RENEWABLE FAMILIES. JUST. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR BOOKS ARE WRAPPING UP WITH THE THE LEGISLATION THAT WORK ALL THESE ARE ACTIVE BILLS YES -- BY GOOD AUTHOR SO I THINK YOU STAND A GOOD CHANCE SOMEBODY'S BECOMING LAW -- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE JUST -- ON THAT WHAT WITH THE ONE THAT POPPED OUT SEEING I THINK YOU'RE ALLUDING TO AS A POTENTIAL PIECE OF THE LEGISLATIVE IDEA FOR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. IS INCLUDING CLT THE DEFINITION OF A HOUSING SPONSORED THAT IS WRONG INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT IS RIGHT -- YEAH YEAH I'M SORRY THERE THERE IS REGULATION FOR EXAMPLE THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING PROMULGATED NOW IN TERMS OF THE HOME PROGRAM -- THE THE CAL HOME PROGRAM YEAH -- WE'VE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED COMMENTS SUGGESTING THAT THEY MAKE A IN THE IN THE DEFINITIONS FOR THEM PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ON THE DEFINING COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS. WHEN THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY COULD USE THIS GUIDANCE YES? OKAY WE'LL KEEP THIS POST ON IT. THAT'S DONE BY REGULATION IF NOT MAYBE BY LEGISLATION WE SHOULD LOOK FOR IT IS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE YEAR. I THINK THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE -- AND I WAS ABLE TO PROBLEMS BILLS ALREADY SO YOU CAN. MAKE -- G. A. LAST COMMENTS BEFORE ABOUT BUT THE MOVE TO THE NEXT AS A NO JUST GET OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IT MAY NOT A VOTE VOTED ON THESE BILLS YEAH PLEASE VOTE FOR THEM. I I KNOW THAT -- ONE NINETY SIX IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND THAT'S IN THE ASSEMBLY RIGHT NOW SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GET TO THE FOR VERY SOON. ALL YOU KNOW THE TRIGGERS A QUESTION I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT -- WE TOOK OUR OFTEN WITH PUBLIC SUBSIDY OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN PARTICULAR PROJECTS COMES -- WORKER -- GUIDELINES AND LEVELS PAY THINGS OF THAT NATURE IS THAT TRUE FOR LAND TRUSTS -- I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC SOURCES OF FUNDS PROVIDED TO OUR COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS -- TO SOME -- SOME FORMS OF OF SUBSIDY WOULD REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE -- IN CERTAIN WAYS RESTRICTIONS ARE. INVITING US ABSOLUTELY CHASING CARRYING MY COME ON DOWN. AND IS SUCH AS MEDICAL PERCENT WHICH IN EITHER OF THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA PART OF GENERAL SERVICES REAL ESTATE. DIVISION. IS MAYBE NOT I WAS LOOKING FOR US TO TODAY NO PRESSURE. YEAH BARS REALLY HIGH THANK YOU. WELL IN IN JEAN DID SET THE BAR FOR EFFICIENT PRESENTATION TEARS -- I'LL DO MY BEST THANK YOU -- SO WE OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO ITS PART -- AND DRIVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND SO EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SIX NINETEEN AS WE ARE TALK ABOUT TODAY -- UNDER A COUPLE THINGS ONE JUST KIND OF GIVE A QUICK BRIEF -- HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHICH IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SURPLUS AND ACCESS PROPERTY. AS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY A FIRST OF ITS KIND OF PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH -- AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WHEREAS WITH THAT SPECIFICALLY AND THEN THE RESULTS TO DATE -- AND KIND OF WHAT THE THE THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE FOR US. SO -- IN TERMS OF THIS THIS ACCESS OUR CLOSEST ENGINE SO STATE PROPERTY IS IS OWNED BY THE STATE BUT IT'S HELD IN TRUST BY DEPARTMENTS AND WE COULD BE COULD BE TERM THAT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER A PIECE OF PROPERTY -- AND SO DEPARTMENTS HAVE JURISDICTION OVER STATE PROPERTY AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE USING IT FOR THEIR TO EXECUTE THEIR MISSION -- STATE HOSPITALS HAVE IT TO TREAT PATIENTS -- CHP OFFICERS HAVE IT TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER -- AS THOSE PROPERTIES -- OF NO LONGER MEET THEIR NEEDS WHEN THEY NEED TO RELOCATE SUPPORTING IT DOWNSIZE FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS CHANGED THE MISSION IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. THE WAY IT WORKS IN STATUTE IS THAT THEY WOULD DECLARE THE PROPERTY ACCESS AND THAT WOULD TRIGGER DG HAS TO COME IN AND BEGIN WORKING ON A DISPOSITION PROCESS. THAT COULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THIS AGENCY IT COULD BE -- A LONG TERM LEASE OR SOME SORT DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS DONE IN THE PAST OR IT COULD BE A SALE PROCESS GOING THROUGH A LEGISLATION TO BE AUTHORIZES SURPLUS -- HISTORICALLY WE GET ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR IS A BIG YEAR OF PROPERTIES DECLARED ACCESS BY DEPARTMENTS -- IT REALLY IS NOT A VOLUMINOUS PROCESS SO WHAT THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER REPORTERS TO DO WAS TO GO THROUGH AND SORT OF TO A PROACTIVE REVIEW OF STATE PROPERTY -- SO WE HAD A TEAM OF NINE PEOPLE LOOK AT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PARCELS ACROSS THE STATE -- WHICH I WILL DOUBLE TALK ABOUT THE RESULT IN A SACK -- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT REVIEW -- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES US TO TAKE A VERY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEING LIKE A FINAL -- WE DO INITIAL INVENTORY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PRIORITIZE SITES FOR DEVELOPMENT -- THESE GIVE ORDER ALSO -- FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION APPROACHES -- THERE IS A SINCERE DESIRE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS RECOGNIZING THAT ANYTHING WE BUILD IS GOING TO BE IN SOMEONE'S COMMUNITY -- AND IF IF YOU READ EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU SEE A LOT OF EXPEDITED DATES WE WANT TO BUILD THIS WE WANT ALL THESE THINGS FAST. SO WHAT ARE PROCESS STEPS SO ONE VISUAL INVENTORY -- AND THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED -- PARTNERING TOGETHER H. C. D. AND D. G. S. HAVE CREATED A SCREENING TOOL -- THAT THOSE PARCELS HAVE BEEN UNDERGONE IN TERMS OF HELPING US SORT OF UNDERSTAND YES SOMETHING MIGHT BE DEVELOPING BOWL BUT IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING -- AND THEN THE NEXT BIG STEP WAS TAKEN AWHILE IS TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH DEPARTMENTAL BETTING -- WE'VE LOOKED AT PARCELS THAT THAT -- THAT COULD BE OVER HOUSING THAT WERE APPROPRIATE FOR THE BILL FOR HOUSING -- BUT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT THE SITE DIDN'T HAVE A MILLION ENCUMBRANCES ON IT THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT THE SITE WAS INTO SHE TO THE STATE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE -- IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT -- THAT APARTMENT ACTUALLY WASN'T USING IT JUST IN TIME WE EVALUATED THEY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE -- AND SO WE WENT THROUGH A DEPARTMENTAL VETTING PROCESS TO GET TO SITES WHERE DEPARTMENTS HAVE AGREED YES THIS LIKE CAN BE DECLARED ACCESS SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD -- AND THAT HAS ALSO BEEN COMPLETED JUST RECENTLY SO -- NOW WE'RE AT THE SITE PRIVATIZATION PIECE WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF SITES WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE PRIORITIZING -- WHICH ONES WILL GET DEVELOPED -- THE NEXT STEPS IN THE FUTURE BEYOND THAT WOULD BE -- TO PUBLISHER HEAT MAP SHOWING ALL OF OUR SITES WITH AN OVERLAY OF WHERE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED. ACROSS THE STATE -- THEN WILL TAKE THOSE -- PRIORITIZE SITES BEGIN TO DO REAL ESTATE DUE DILIGENCE AND THEN -- ISSUE ARE PEAS AND ART THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS A DEADLINE FOR THE FIRST OUR PIECE TO GO OUT IN SEPTEMBER THE END OF SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO COMING UP VERY SOON. SO WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE SO WERE REVIEWED IT PRIMARILY FOR TWO THINGS -- DEVELOPED ABILITY AND USE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SHEA FILES WERE LOOKING AT THE SIGHTS THEMSELVES ARE THEY OF THE RIGHT SIZE AND WE'RE LOOKING IN A LARGE AND SMALL -- SO LONG AS ARE NOT LIKE STRIPS OF LAND OR THEY UNDER FREEWAY. ARE THEY UNDER WATER THINGS LIKE THAT -- WE HAVE QUITE A FEW OF THOSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT -- AND THEN AT THE SAME POINT IN TIME WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR A USAGE SO IS IT A VACANT PARKING LOT -- IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT HAVE -- BOUGHT PROPERTY FOR A AND ET FACILITY TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WE ONLY DEVELOPED ON THREE QUARTERS OF IT SO MAYBE WE COULD PARCEL OFF THE OTHER QUARTER DEVELOP THEIR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- BACK ON SCREEN DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS ACROSS THE STATE AND THE SCREENING TOOL I MENTIONED WAS AN APPLIED AND SOCIAL TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT TOOL DOES AND HOW IT WAS USED IN A SECOND -- AND THEN WE TAKE THOSE THIRTY NINE THIRTY PARCELS AND YOU ACTUALLY GROUP THEM INTO SITES -- A LOT OF THEM WERE ADJACENT OR ACROSS THE STREET EACH OTHER SO WE WE STARTED USING THE SITE TERMINOLOGY THERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO THAT NUMBER -- GOT BIGGER AND SMALLER -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE REACHED OUT AND ASKED US ABOUT SITE EXERCISE WHY -- THERE ARE CERTAIN SITES FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD TO DISCOUNTED ARE DISCARDED -- BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD MENTIONED HEY WE ONLY JUST A PARTIAL AND SO MAYBE YOUR SITE ISN'T A WHOLE BUT TOGETHER IT IS AND SO -- THE NUMBERS FLEXED AND IT'S GONE UP AND GOING DOWN -- AND THEN THE THE DEPARTMENT VETTING HAS OCCURRED AND SO AFTER -- IT LIMITING THE SIZE I HAVE THE BILLS ENCUMBRANCES THAT -- HOW THE LEGITIMATE -- FUTURE UTILIZATION -- OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS WE ARE DOWN TO ABOUT A HUNDRED SITES STATEWIDE. THAT NUMBER WILL ALSO FLEX -- UP AND DOWN WE HAVE -- SOME APPEALS FRANKLY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH A DEPARTMENTS -- BUT AND SOME OF THOSE SITES ARE GONNA NATIONALLY SLOUGH OFF MEANING WE WE LOOK AT THEM THAT AVAILABLE MIGHT BE PROPER HOUSING. BUT THEY BE REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY HARD TO DO IS MAYBE THOSE WILL NATURALLY FALL OFF OR GOING OUT TO KIND OF SEE LIKE GOES BUT FOR RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT ABOUT A HUNDRED SITES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THE NEXT LIGHT HERE GIVES YOU A SENSE. FOR JUST THE SCOPE -- THIS IS SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS EVERY STATE ON PARCEL IN THE COUNTY -- YOU CAN GET A SENSE FOR JUST OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE IN. URBAN AREAS THAT CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE RURAL AREAS THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW PARKS LAND FORCE LAND THINGS LIKE THAT -- SOME NATIONALLY SCREEN THEMSELVES OUT -- THIS NEXT LIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE TO SACRAMENTO -- THIS IS A SITE -- JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL CAPITAL THAT BIG PARK AREA OF IT'S ACTUALLY A TGS -- OWN SITE IT'S A PARKING LOTS AND THERE IS A SMALL -- COMPLEX THERE THAT USUALLY USE USE USE -- FOR EVENTS SO WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED IN TAKING A SITE MAKING -- VIA AN EXAMPLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO EASY CENTS FOR KIND OF WHAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH VERSES THE SIZE THAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE SITES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE WE'VE GOT -- SITES ADJACENT TO PRISONS OR STAY HOSPITALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW SAFELY AWAY BUT VERY AVAILABLE AND WE HAVE TYPE URBAN SITES LIKE THIS AS WELL -- SO NOW TO RESOLVE TO TALK ABOUT THE SCREENING CRITERIA. HI AND SOCIAL SAKE I AM THE DATE IN RESEARCH MANAGER FOR HOUSING POLICY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY FORTUNATE TO GET TO WORK WITH DTS IN A REALLY GREAT PARTNERSHIP IN SHORT TIMING -- TO GET THIS DONE SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO FOCUS ON TWO COMPONENTS TO SCREENING TOOLS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE SLIDES AS HOUSING NEED. AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THE TALK ABOUT THEM QUICKLY BUT TALK ABOUT THE DATA THAT'S BEHIND THEM. I AND SO FOR HOUSING NEED REALLY THERE WERE JUST TRYING TO SEE WHERE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED AND MOST IMPACTFUL AS DESIGNED AND AN IO. SO WE LOOK AT AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE RATE OF INCREASE IN RENT. SO FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH HOUSING IS AVAILABLE IN THE JOB AND COMMUTERS SHEDS SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE SHORTFALL OF VERY LOW INCOME UNITS. EXCEEDS 30% OF THE NEED SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT FOR VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IS THERE ENOUGH HOUSING. THAT'S THE FIRST MEASURE THE SECOND BEING THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND HERE WE RELY ON SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT ARE. PROJECTED AGAINST THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION WHICH IS A TOPIC THAT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER PRESENTATION TO REALLY COVER BUT JUST TO SAY THAT THERE ARE PLANNING GOALS SET. FOR EACH REGION AND FOR EACH CITY WITHIN REGIONS AND SO WE LOOK AT WHERE THE GAP BETWEEN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION. AND THE BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED IS GREATER THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO WHERE WE START SEEING THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ACTIVITY ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE. AND THEN THIRD WHERE THE RATE OF INCREASE IN RENT -- SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE MEDIAN GROSS RENT INCREASED BY MORE THAN 5%. YEAR OVER YEAR FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND DATA SOURCES FOR ALL OF THIS FOR USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. SO FOR EXAMPLE USING JUST THOSE THREE HOUSING NEED COMPONENTS THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SHOWS THAT IN EACH OF THOSE MATTERS. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO NEEDS HOUSING I KNOW THAT'S NOT SURPRISING HERE BUT MARKING ON EACH OF THOSE MEASURES THAT IS A DEMONSTRATED NEED HERE SO THAT'S ONE COMPONENT. ON THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THIS REALLY BUILD OFF OF THE ANALYSIS THAT CHASEN'S TEAM DID SO BEYOND VISUAL SIDE IDENTIFICATION AS FOR THINKING CAN'T ANYTHING ACTUALLY GET BUILT THERE THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. FURTHER WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER MEASURES THAT MIGHT PROMOTE. OR THAT MIGHT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR A DEVELOPER TO SEEK OTHER FORMS OF SUBSIDY OR FUNDING -- AND BY LOCATION OF THE PARCEL WE KIND OF KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SITES MAY BE COMPETITIVE. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE LOOK AT PROXIMITY TO JOB CENTERS. AND THERE WERE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS WITH LESS THAN A A BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- FALL REALLY HIGH -- AWAY FROM HOW MUCH THE AVAILABILITY THERE IS -- AND SO WE GO FURTHER INTO PROXIMITY TO EDUCATION. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE THERE SCHOOLS CLOSE BY. ARE THERE GOOD SCHOOLS CLOSE BY AND THERE WE USE SOME OF THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY MAPS TO GET SOME OF THAT DATA. AND THE SAME THING WITH THE PROXIMITY TO HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT. SO NOT ONLY. THE PROXIMITY OF A SITE WITHIN THOSE THREE AREAS PROMOTE FEASIBILITY BUT ALSO HELPS MAKE SURE THAT THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION INDEX OR THAT THAT HOUSEHOLD MAY PAY IN THEIR HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS. MIGHT BE LESS IF THE PERSONAL IS LOCATED IN THESE THREE AREAS. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING BUT THAT IS TO SAY WERE ALSO EXPLORING OTHER COMPONENTS OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY AS WE GET DEEPER INTO THE ANALYSIS -- WITH THE CREATION OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE NOT USING THAT IS PRESCRIPTIVE BUT JUST ANOTHER CONSIDERATION SIMILAR WHETHER OR NOT A PARCEL IS AN AREA WHERE CLIMB INVESTMENTS COULD BE LEVERAGED. AND ALSO LOCAL SOURCES OF FUNDING AND ESPECIALLY AS WE GET INTO THAT LOCAL COORDINATION WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT. SO JUST OTHER DETERMINANTS OF FEASIBILITY OR THINGS THAT WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE -- AND ONE OTHER NOTE AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WAS WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING NEED WE JUST RECENTLY ISSUED OUR DETERMINATION OF WHERE JURISDICTIONS ARE AT IN MEETING THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION. AND IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND EIGHTEEN CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY ONLY 10% OF JURISDICTIONS ARE ON PACE TO MEET ALL OF THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION. AND THAT'S IF WE TOOK THEIR PROGRESS IN THEIR PLANNING PERIOD TODAY SO IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER AND CONSIDERING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN JURISDICTIONS. 10% IS NOT A REALLY COMPELLING NUMBER HERE YOU KNOW SO WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. THIS IS NOT ONLY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS A STATE WIDE ISSUE I AM SO THE STATE OF FACTORS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING OR TRYING. TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION IN THOSE HIGH NEED AREAS [INAUDIBLE] SO [INAUDIBLE] TO THE THANK YOU. ART SO WHERE WE GO FROM HERE SO -- ARE DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES IS PRETTY SIMPLE -- THESE WOULD BE STATE DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE NOT PLANNING UNNECESSARILY ON CONCERT BLESSING PROPERTY ALL THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN TIME TO TIME IN THERE ARE NUMBER OF SURPLUS PROPERTIES ON OUR LIST AS WELL -- THEY WOULD BE STATE DEVELOPMENTS MEANING LONG TERM GROUND LEASES TO PRIVATE DEVELOPERS -- WE WOULD LEVERAGE STATE PROPERTY VALUES FREE -- ARE NOT HOLD ME LOOKING TO MAKE RETURNS ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND SO -- HAPPY TO TO TO MAKE THOSE VERY VERY LOW AND VERY LONG TERM GROUND LEASES -- AND THEN WE DO WANT TO FOCUS ON INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES -- WHETHER THAT SMUGGLER PREFAB CLT MICRO UNITS -- WHATEVER WE CAN DO OLD EMILY -- TO TO DRIVE NOT JUST INNOVATION THE SPEAR BUT ALSO MAKE THESE TO BUBBLE FASTER QUICKER -- AND CHEAPER -- WITH LIKEWISE LOOK MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE NONE THE LESS ATTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTS -- AND EQUITABLE TO THERE'S A FOCUS ON PREVAILING WAGE AND AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS WELL. AND THEN JUST A COUPLE OTHER HIGHLIGHTS -- I THINK ARE RELEVANT EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES CALL OUT -- LAND SWAPS AS POSSIBILITIES I MENTIONED THERE WERE A COUPLE OF LOCAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE APPROACHED US -- ABOUT -- CO DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY AND WE'VE WE'VE EXPRESS THIS WITH YOU KNOW HALF A DOZEN -- LOCALITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS OF DEVELOPING MAYBE OUR PROPERTIES -- AREN'T GREAT -- BUT THERE'S NOT A LAND SWAP DEAL -- WE COULD WE COULD COMBINE DEVELOPMENTS -- MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A SALE MAYBE IT'S A SALE -- IN THE PROCEEDS GO TO OFFSET OR EVEN AFFORDABILITY SOMEWHERE ELSE MEAN WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FINE ALL OPTIONS -- AND NOT LOOKING AT A SINGLE WAY OF APPROACHING THE SITES -- I DID MENTION ALL LEVERAGING STING SURPLUS PROPERTY -- ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SITES SOME PRETTY. INTERESTING SITES OF THE STATE HAS HAD FOR YEARS PAYING ONE SHUT DOWN COST OF THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS SHAKEN LOOSE AND SO THERE ARE A FEW SITES THAT WERE IN BEGIN WORKING ON IN A WAY THAT -- WE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO -- AND LASTLY THERE IS -- SOME MENTION EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT POTENTIALLY PRIORITIZE FUNDING AS WELL THAT'S NOT -- DEFINED OR FINALIZE THIS POINT BUT WE ARE LOOKING AND CAN'T OF EXPECTING TO BE ABLE -- TO TO REALLY DIG INTO THE SITES AND DO SOME NEXT BUT EITHER WAY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. ALL RIGHT ANY -- WITH THAT I THINK WE'RE DONE ANY ANY QUESTIONS I'M SURE THERE ARE TIMES. WHEN FIRST CASES SUCH THANK YOU FOR THE PREACHER TATIAN? I SHOULD SAY OUT THE BAD. I WAS OVERJOYED WHEN GOVERNOR SOME PRACTICE EXECUTIVE ORDER -- I THINK FOR A GOVERNOR WHO AND EXPRESSLY CO HOUSING PLATFORM IT WAS REFRESHING NOT JUST TO SEE THIS GUY CAN WATER GO OUT BUT TO GO OUT SO EARLY IN HIS ADMINISTRATION I THINK STATE A TEMPO. THE STATE'S COUNTRY A TRUE LEADER ON THIS ANYBODY BUT THOSE OF US FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO OFTEN FEEL AS OF THE STATE I KNOW IS TO BE ANY STUFF OF US -- THIS IS A I THINK SYMBOLIC THAT THE STATE IS WILLING TO WALK IT'S ONE O'CLOCK RIGHT -- THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE PART TO PARTNERS OF PARTICIPANTS IN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS SO CERTAINLY KUDOS TO GOVERNOR NEEDS SOME -- FOR NOT ONLY IDENTIFYING THIS AS FOR WHAT IT IS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT FOR ACTUALLY LEADING ON ON THAT AREA WE HAVE SOME MORE CONTROLLED BY BECAUSE WE ON THE PROPERTY -- AND I WOULD DEFY ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS PRESENTATION AND OUTCOME AWAIT THE REALLY IMPRESSED BY WHAT YOU ALL PUT TOGETHER IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME -- YEAH THIS IS A FEW MONTHS TO BE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT SIX MONTHS BARELY MAYBE THERE ABOUT -- AGAIN I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL ME BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AS WELL AS THE TOOLS AND THE THE FILTERS THAT YOU PUT THIS THROUGH. YEAH AND AND NOT A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO SCALE THE FOR THE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I THINK I HEARD YOU MAKE MENTION JJ'S AND THAT. IN AN AVERAGE YEAR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE TO FOUR PROPERTIES MAYBE IN A YEAR. DO THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT ABOUT A HUNDRED SITES IS THAT RIGHT. I MEAN SAID IT'S A PICTURE OF THE SCALE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE RELATIVE TO OUR HISTORIC PERFORMANCE WHICH I THINK IS IN KEEPING WITH THE SIZE THE CRISIS IN THE BEAUTY OF LIFE. CALIFORNIANS ARE DEALING WITH SOME I I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC -- THE THERE WERE A NUMBER. I GET TO THIS HOUSE WHERE -- THREE EIGHT TERMS THE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS I BELIEVE YOU'RE AT THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT BESIDE PRIVATIZATION. YEAH AND ALL OF THIS -- TO GET THROUGH ALL THAT [INAUDIBLE] COUNTING. SEVEN ALL SEVEN STEPS BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER IS THAT YEAH NOT NOT OLD SITES WILL BE DEVELOPED AT THE SAME TIME -- OBVIOUSLY THE AND THERE'S THERE'S ONLY SO MANY RESOURCES THAT WE HAD TO ISSUE THESE ARE PEAS AND WE DON'T ALSO SATURATE THE MARKET -- THE INITIAL OUR PEACE NEED TO GO OUT BUT IN SEPTEMBER -- WE IMAGINE THIS TO BE SOMETHING THAT TIME -- MOST OF THE SITES WE DO HAVE -- THEY'RE NOT ENCUMBERED PERMANENTLY BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME SHORT TERM ENCUMBRANCES -- AND SO -- LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW TO BE ASSEMBLY BUILDINGS -- THAT YOU JUST YOU KNOW MODOC ADVISE ON THE ON THE LIST -- AND SO. THEY'LL TAKE AWHILE TO GET THE GET THOSE GUYS OUT INTO -- THE LEAST MARKET ALTER LOCATIONS AND SO YES I DAY IN THERE AND THEY WILL BE A SENSE OF A PROGRESSION IN THIS. BUT YES OUR OUR FIRST TO GO FROM ASIANS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO OUR FIRST ART PIECE OUT AND ESSENTIALLY IN A FEW MONTHS OR SO IS. IT'S BEEN LEFT. BUT IT I MEAN IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME STARTED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS THAT YOU. SURVEYED MANY GET TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW IN THE SHORT ON TIME AGAIN THE MARKET WILL KUDOS. TONS OF APPRECIATION -- IN TERMS THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF PEAS WE SAY THERE'S NO PROMISES OF THE NUMBER OF OUR FEES THAT COME OUT -- HE'S EVEN CURRENTLY AT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW SPELL OUT FORTY OF THE REASONS THAT YOU MENTIONED -- WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT AND -- HUNDRED ALRIGHT PEAS -- IN SEPTEMBER -- IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING YEAH IT'LL BE LESS THAN A HUNDRED I MEAN I I PROBABLY I HONESTLY I WOULD IMAGINE PROBABLY THE FIRST ROUND WILL BE BETWEEN THEM YOU KNOW. THREE ASH -- WOULD BE PLAY THE PROBABLY THE THE THAN INITIALS ALTHOUGH -- AND THEN WILL TEST THE WATERS AS WELL -- WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE -- EXACTLY HOW MANY RESPONSES WERE GOING TO GET THE THE FIRST LITTLE BIT TO SEE HOW IT GOES IN THE KIND OF WORK OVER EXPERIENCING. ISSUES RUN INTO WE MIGHT HAVE TO RETOOL OUR P. WITH MY THREE TO OUR GROUND THESE ALL THAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF OURSELVES AND JUST PULL BACK CONSIDERABLY. I DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ALWAYS THE RISK OF DOING SOMETHING WRONG SO YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ON EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE EXACTLY SO IF YOU ISSUE YOUR FIRST ART P. SOMETIME IN THE FALL WHEN WITH THE NEXT GROUP OF OUR PEACE GO OUT ANY ADULT. YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A TASK OF THOSE SELF MANAGING A COMPETITIVE PROCESS HE'LL BE IS THERE THE BAND WITH TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE REMAINING. NINETY SEVEN CARS. OPPORTUNITIES IS IT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE CONTINUAL PUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THESE PROPERTIES ARE BEING RELEASED IN. AND PUT OUT OF FOR FOR INTEREST SO I HAVE -- YEAH THE WHOLE UNITS WHOSE DEDICATED PURPOSE IS THE DISPOSITION STATE PROPERTY -- INCLUDING LONG TERM DEVELOPMENTS -- IT'S NOT A HUGE UNIT LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW FOR PROPERTIES YEAR PLUS OR MINUS -- MOST OF THE DEALS THEY WORK ON OUR IN THE CONTEXT MUCH WORK OF THIS IS THAT'S GOING TO BE IF YOU KNOW OVERLY ONEROUS WE MIGHT ASK ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY -- WE'RE STILL KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT YOU DISPLAY WHERE IT'S GOING WITH THIS MAKING SURE THAT YOUR RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO DO. THIS WORK I MEAN IT'S A POOR TO GET THESE WERE PROPERTIES RELEASE BUT NO ONE WANTS TO DO A TAXPAYER GIVEAWAY -- SO -- IT'S A IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE BUT IF PASSAGE PROLONG YOUR YOUR OB YOU GOING ON IS A VERY SMART FASHION. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT YOU WILL LET US KNOW -- IT'S A MINISTRATION BUT THOSE ARE LEGISLATURE WHO WANT TO BE SUPPORTED GOING TO THE SCREEN TOOL IF I MAY UM. SUCH I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE THE FIRST BULLET HOUSING NEED THAT THE FOUR OF THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS MEASURED BY VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING AND DID I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY. YES FOR EARLY BECAUSE OF THEIR AS OPPOSED TO LOW INCOME OR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. OKAY AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THERE'S NOT STILL A GAP THERE BUT WE'RE REALLY JUST FIRST PURPOSES OF MEASURING AND HAVING A CONSISTENT MEASUREMENT KNOWING THAT IT FOR NOT MEETING THE MOST VERY LOW INCOME. OR SEEN TRICKLE OF FACTS AND ALL THE OTHER INCOME CATEGORIES GENERALLY FROM A LOOK AT THE DATA IN RECOGNIZING OF BACK TO THE LATTER YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY OF THOSE RATHER DOES NOT EXIST AND IF. HAVE BEST MAYBE REALLY FRAIL -- SO YOU'RE USING THE METRIC OF VERY LOW WHICH HAS A DEFINITION AS THE LATTER INDICATE -- AND THEN YOUR ANSWER WAS UP THESE THREE SCREENS ROUSING THE CITY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ACTUALLY QUALIFIES. AND I THINK YOU FOR THE MENTION THAT OF EIGHTEEN CITIES -- IN THE IN THE COUNTY IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OR TWO BABY. ON BASE. PACE NOT WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN AND THEN MISSION ACCOMPLISHED TRIED TO RIGHTLY CLEAR POINT AND FIND OUT THE STATUS OF WOMEN GROW BY THINK THEY MIGHT BE THE ONE YEAH I AM I BELIEVE THAT IT IS LIMÓN GROW -- BUT I HAVE OTHER STATISTICS TO TO SHOW JUST PERCENTAGES WITHIN THE COUNTY BUT I HAD IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD -- ONLY 84% OF JURISDICTIONS ARE MEETING THEIR VERY LOW FOR ARE ON PACE TO ME THEY'RE VERY LOW AND LOW TARGETS -- 90% ARE NOT MEETING THEIR MODERATE TARGETS -- AND THIRTY TWO ARE NOT MEETING THEIR ABOVE MODERATE TARGETS SO MOST AND THIS IS DIFFICULT TO WHAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT IS EASIER GENERALLY EASIER TO BUILD AND FOR RESTRICTIONS ARE PRIORITIZING ABOVE MARK ABOVE MODERATE. DEVELOPMENT FOR MARKET DEVELOPMENT RIGHT RIGHT TO THE HARD TO BUILD AND EVEN THE MIDDLE TO BUILD COAXING AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HE'S INTENDED TO DO -- BOTH CARROTS AND STICKS TO TO HELP ADDRESS THIS CRISIS CAN I JUST ADD ONE THING TO JUST THIS THE SCREEN CRITERIA CERTAINLY FOCUSING ON LOW INCOME BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT -- YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR ADULT MUCH REALLY FOCUSED THAT WAY EITHER -- IT IS A GOOD CLARIFICATION WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DEAL -- IN SAN JOSE WHICH WILL BE. THE FOCUS OF THE MIDDLE INCOME FOR EXAMPLE. SEE YOU IN MY HEAD JASON BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE AT THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING RIGHT AND YOU KNOW. THAT WHILE THERE IS TREMENDOUS NEED I THINK THERE'S A LOWE'S GONNA FOLKS SHOW US SHORTLY NAY YEAH WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE PRODUCTION AND VERY LOW LOW INCOME WITH NEXT TO NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE. AND MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE STATE'S LEAN IN ON THIS -- YEAH I WILL CONCERNS ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CALIFORNIA -- YEAH IN THE GOVERNOR IS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL AND IF WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. THESE PROPERTIES ARE ASSETS THAT CAN ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF WORKING MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE FOLKS GET EVERY SINGLE DAY GO TO A JOB PAY THEIR TAXES PLAY BY THE RULES -- THEY NEED TO SEE THE STATE SEES THAT HERE'S THAT IS DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM -- AND I HOPE THAT THIS EXERCISE WOULD BE A PART OF THAT AFTER AT THE RISK OF GETTING MYSELF IN TROUBLE -- YEAH THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE -- YOU KNOW HOSPITALS VETERAN CENTERS YOU KNOW IN YOUR BILL AND NAPA AND WE'VE GOT PRISONS IN FOLSOM AND AND YOU KNOW THERE'S PLACES WHERE -- PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES JUST TO GO TO WORK AT THE STATE FACILITIES AND SO -- YOU KNOW A POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOMETHING THAT'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL OR HOUSING FOCUSED AS WELL ADDING IS IS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE TABLE FOR US YEAH. I LIKE THAT ANSWER. AND SO ONE COMPONENT TO I THINK IS THAT WITH THE WE'LL SEE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF ART PEAS AND WE REALLY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO LEAVE SPACE CREATIVITY FOR DEVELOPERS AND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO COME TO THE TABLE AND THINK ABOUT WHAT SOLUTIONS MAKE SENSE AND SO I THINK THAT IS ALSO WHAT WILL BE LEARNING IN THE FIRST ROUND AND CONTINUE GROUNDS IS WHAT CREATIVITY WE ARE. NOT YOU KNOW THAT THE ONLY ONES WITH GOOD IDEAS HERE AND WE WELCOME LOCAL SOLUTIONS ON TO COME UP WITH WHAT MAKES SENSE. I LOVE THAT I JUST TRY TO WRAP BUT THE LEVEL ON THE EDITOR. ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FOR YOUR SCREENING TOOLS ARE SENATE HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT HOW ARE YOU DEFINING HIGH FREQUENCY. OF ITS ANY AREA WITHIN THE STATE THE TEN WITH AND HAVE A WE'RE CONSIDERING WOULD BE THERE BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A WAY TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. NOT ONLY FOR THE DEVELOPER BEFORE THE HOUSEHOLDS. WHAT ARE YOU MAKING THAT WAS PARTY TESTIMONY WHICH IS SPOT ON I'VE GOT DEFINITION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SENATOR WE DON'T I CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME GOING BACK AND FORTH? WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT -- I THINK QUIRK A QUARTER MILE IN FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS. ABSOLUTELY QUALIFY THEY GOING BEYOND THAT WE START TO REALLY STRETCH AND WE PROBABLY DO NEED TO STRETCH THE THE SENATE THE SIZE AND SCALE OF CLIMATE CRISIS IS SO SIGNIFICANT WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO THAT. HOWEVER I THINK FOR THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HOUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS A QUARTER MILE AND AND SEVEN MINUTE FIFTEEN MINUTE. LOOK AT SHARON AND PAUL WHO I KNOW THAT A CHEAP TO DO THAT LOVED EVERY LEVEL OF FREQUENCY BUT THESE THINGS ARE ALL CONNECTED WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY WE HAVE CLIMB AS OUR LAST. DISCUSSION THE LAST ROUND OF QUESTIONS IS SHAMELESS PROMOTION I THINK YOU MAY BE AWARE OF DOING ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR AROUND THE STATE BUILDING HERE IN SAN DIEGO -- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT IS IN THE LEGISLATION THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT YOUR THAT'S FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO DO -- BUT CAN YOU -- LET US KNOW WHERE THAT PROPERTY MAY BE IN TERMS OF THE SCREEN AND THE RPM HAD TO PROCESS. YEAH I MEAN THAT -- IT'S IT'S A IT'S A INTERESTING SITE AND THAT'S NOT JUST A STATE OFFICE BUILDING BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT ACROSS THE STREET WITH A CONDEMNED BUILDING AND THE OTHER -- ONE AND IT'S IT'S LITERALLY FLANKED ON ALL SIDES BY. THIRTY STORY HIGH RISE BUILDINGS -- BUT YES THAT WE DO WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT BUILDING BEING ON OUR ACCESS LIST. LIKE THAT THE ANSWER. YOU CAN IMAGINE -- THE THAT ANGST I HAVE I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH LOCALITIES TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO PULL CITY BLOCKS -- THERE'S OWN FOR HIGH DENSITY HOUSING -- WITH ONE SIX STORY BUILDING THAT IS SEEN FAR BETTER DAYS AND AS YOU MENTION A CONDEMNED BUILDING ON THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T SPEAK WELL FOR THE FOR THE STATE -- HOW TO SHARE GETTING TOTALLY UP FOR NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL THESE ARE AREAS IS OUR BOX FOR A LOT OF FUN COMMUNITY COMPLAINT -- IN TERMS OF ILLEGAL LODGING -- SMELL AND GARBAGE OTHER KINDS OF ISSUES -- TGS STAFF FOR DOING THE VERY BEST THEY CAN TO MITIGATE THAT BUT ULTIMATELY THE BLIGHTED CONDITION THEY ARE ONLY TRACKS MORE DEUCES. AND THE FACT THAT YOU COULD DO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT HOUSING THERE -- THIS IS IS THE IMPETUS THE DESIRED AND THEY'VE GOT -- SO WE BILL -- ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR INTRODUCED I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT I'M GLAD IT'S ON THE RADAR. THERE WAS A REPORT WE PUBLISHED JUST A FEW MONTHS BACK -- THAT THAT THE INDICATE WHICH BUILDINGS ACROSS OF A POLIO STATEWIDE THAT WE WOULD BE DECLARING XSLT LONG TERM LOOKING -- TO DISPOSITION -- THAT BUILDING AND THAT BOTH THOSE LAWS ARE DEFINITELY ON IT -- AND WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE THOSE LAWS -- I GOT ALL KINDS IDEAS -- QUICKLY GET SHE WAS PROMOTION -- THE EASY EIGHT HOTEL WHICH IS CURRENTLY -- INTERESTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION -- IN OLD TOWN EMILY JASON BELLTOWN TRANSIT CENTER I DID LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO UTILIZE THAT PROPERTY IF IT IF IT DESIRED -- TO I THINK WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO TO EXTINGUISH THE LEAST THERE AND HAVE IT IS A NEW LIFE WE'RE HAVING TREMENDOUS SUCCESS HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE IN FOR THE MOTEL FACILITIES I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER. IT'S NEAR OUR COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES I MEAN IT'S JUST THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS WHERE AGAIN LIKE THE STATE'S DOING ALL IT CAN TO BE A SOLUTION PROVIDER -- THE SOON TO BE VACATED SEAT FACILITY ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY ON PACIFIC HIGHWAY -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A RESIDENTIAL AREA BUT THAT MIGHT. ALLOW FOR USES THAT OTHER RESIDENTS NEIGHBORHOODS MAY NOT WANT -- AGAIN THAT'S A POSSIBILITY IN MY LAST AND I'M THAT THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY QUESTION -- THE DMV IN HILLCREST -- IS CURRENTLY SLATED FOR A REPLACEMENT -- SENATOR ATKINS AND I HAVE BEEN THERE VOCAL AND NOT WANTING TO SEE THE STANDARD ISSUE SUBURBAN DMV ON THAT URBAN INFILL SITE NOT A STRAIGHT TALKING ABOUT YEAH AND THE STAFF HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND PUT THE PROPOSED PROJECT ON ICE. THIS WOULD NOT BE ACCESS BECAUSE THE STATE STILL HAS A USE OF FORCE THAT WOULD REALLY BE PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION. TODAY BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WHATEVER COMES BACK FROM THAT SORT OF INTERNAL PROCESSES ONE IS A MIXED USE. PROPERTY WITH A FULL SCALE DMV BUT WITH A BOATLOAD WORKFORCE HOUSING ON TOP OF IT -- WE AS A COMMUNITY AS A STATE MR BLONSKY IS RUNNING HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT A BLOCK AWAY -- THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT'S CURRENTLY RENT YOU KNOW IN IN THIRTY MORE INFILL -- SEVERAL STORY BUILDINGS THERE THE COMMUNITY IS ACCEPTING OF THIS WHICH GOOD LUCK FINDING THAT A LOT OF PLACES -- SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THIS IS A NO BRAINER I'M REALLY HOPEFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GET THIS PROPERTY IS A FALL INTO THAT FILTER -- BUT I THINK IT COULD BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE STATE OF THE STATE -- WITH THESE HOW THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CERTAINLY A WAY TO KEEP FAITH WITH WORKING A MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE -- IF I CAN JUST REPEAT IT NOW TO BE A DEAD HORSE INCREDIBLE WORK REALLY ABLE TO EXCEPTIONAL WORKING PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT YOU IN CONSERVING TO PURSUE THIS. HUNDRED PROPERTIES I THINK WOULD NOT CLEARLY YOU'LL THOUSAND HOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS ONLY BE SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE WHICH AFTER. AFTER THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. WE'LL GO TO ASK THE BIG CHEESE HIMSELF -- POGGIBONSI OUR CEO THE CITY OF THE DEPOSIT TRANSIT SYSTEM I HAVE A GREAT DEEP LOVE FOR POSSIBLE ON SKI AND I APPRECIATE THAT HE'S HERE TODAY BECAUSE WHAT THE STATE'S EMBARKING ON THIS EFFORT. HIS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN LOOKING AT ITS OWN PROPERTIES FOR SOMETIME NOW WITH SOME GOOD NEWS REPORT RIGHT SO OFTEN FOR YOURS. O'DONNELL I DON'T SHARE COULD I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CLOUT HOWEVER COME UP. TO JUST TURN YOUR MICROPHONE RIGHT [INAUDIBLE] SPEAK. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT TO SEE YOU. I LOVE HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSIT SO MUCH. AND AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU GOT ALL THAT TRAINING SO THAT MAKES ME VERY PROP 1100% YOU. ANYWAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND YEAH WE HAVE A LOT OF EXCITING THINGS GOING ON WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING -- YOU KNOW WITHIN THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW JUST AS AN OPENING -- YOU KNOW T. O. D. HAS SPECIAL MEANING TO US AND AND WE'VE ALREADY LOOKING FOR WAYS AS WE DEVELOP OUR PROPERTY OVER WHETHER IT'S PARK AND RIDE SITES OR OTHER SURPLUS PROPERTY. TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IS GOING BUT ONLY IF IT GENERATES WRITERS TO TRANSIT. AND AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENTS IN A BIT MARKET RATE HOUSING -- WE DON'T GET AS MUCH AS WE WOULD HOPE TO YOU KNOW WE CAN WE HAVE DEVELOPMENTS ALONG MISSION VALLEY AND PLACES LIKE THAT THAT YOU WOULD THINK GENERATE A LOT. BUT PEOPLE WORKING SORRENTO AND OTHERS AND AND THEY DON'T REALLY ACCESS IT SO I THINK THIS VENUE OR THIS VENTURE INTO MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ESPECIALLY -- WORK FOR HOUSING HOPEFULLY THAT LENDS ITSELF TO A GREATER USE OF TRANSIT AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE EVEN SOME GREATER INITIATIVES ON OUR PART TO INDUCE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. ANYWAY -- INVENTORY OF MTS PROPERTY WE HAVE PROBABLY AT LEAST SEVENTY ACRES THAT -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- THAT'S GROSS ACRES -- MANY OF THESE PLACES HAVE -- TRANSIT USES ON ANYWHERE FROM PARKING LOTS TO TRAIN STATIONS TRACTION POWER SUBSTATIONS -- IN OTHERS THAT WE HAVE TO RETAIN FOR TRANSIT AND EVEN SOME OF THE PARKING WERE WE WE HAVE TO RETAIN ALTHOUGH. A WE'RE TRYING TO MINIMIZE SAID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE AND ELEMENT. OTHER AREAS -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT HAVE A TRANSIT CENTER ON A PER SE -- BUT OTHER AREAS IN -- COMMUNITY PLANS FOR EXAMPLE THE GRANT BILL DEVELOPMENT THE WORKING ON NOW HAS THE ELDORADO CREEK RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND SO -- F. AS YOU'LL SEE IN A SECOND A COUPLE OF ACRES OF THAT PROPERTY WILL ACTUALLY GO TO WORD -- CREEK DEVELOPMENT -- THIS IS KIND OF OUR INVENTORY RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE GOT IT ALL OVER OUR SYSTEM HE'S COUNTY WE'VE GOT -- FIVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS YEARS USUALLY -- CHULA VISTA THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS -- GENERALLY OVER PARKING RIGHT SHOTS SITES WHERE WE MAINTAIN PARKING THEN BUILD OVER ON PODIUM -- CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS -- I THINK THERE'S EIGHT SITES HERE ALL THE WAY FROM RANCHO BERNARDO ALL THE WAY DOWN -- TO BUYER AND THERE'S SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE -- AS YOU SEE THE ONES IN RED A RED BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON FOR TODAY'S HEARING BECAUSE WE'RE PRETTY ACTIVELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE RIGHT NOW AND SO I CAN GIVE A GOOD TESTIMONY AS TO WHAT. THEY ARE. OF OUR POLICY EIGHTEEN IS THE POLICY THAT HAS -- KIND OF DIRECTED -- TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPMENT ON OUR PROPERTY. AND WE RECENTLY MADE SOME CHANGES TO IT OVERALL THE POLICY PROVIDES DIRECTION TO STAFF ON HOW BEST TO USE. UTILIZE -- MTS PROPERTY -- WE RECENTLY AMENDED IT TO INCORPORATED AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT IN ALL OUR RESIDENTIAL SO THERE'S A AFFORDABLE AND IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK THE BOARD HOPES THAT THAT WOULD BE IN THE VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME AFFORDABILITY -- AND AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING AT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS AND AND PUTTING THAT FORD. I HELPS WITH -- TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE -- ALSO AS PART OF THIS -- POLICY IN IN OUR PROCUREMENT POLICY POLICY FIFTY TWO IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS. THE BOARD AT ITS NEXT MEETING WILL ENTERTAIN REQUIRING OF PREVAILING WAGE -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF PROJECTS ON OUR ACCESS PROPERTY -- STORE ALREADY DEVELOPING SOME OF PROJECTS UNDER THIS NEW POLICY -- THE FIRST ONE THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HIS GRANVILLE THE GRANVILLE STATION IS LOCATED ALONG I.. EIGHT IT IS -- ONE STATION WEST OF SD ISSUE -- SO -- IT'S A GREAT LOCATION GREAT VISIBILITY GREAT LOCATION GREAT ACCESS TO TRANSIT -- WE HAVE UP. JUST A LITTLE OVER NINETY ACRES THERE BUT JUST UNDER FIVE ACRES ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOP MOBILE AND THE REST WILL EITHER GO TO HELP RUNOFF CREEK DEVELOPMENT OR THE TRANSIT CENTER ITSELF IS THERE. THIS IS AN INTERESTING PROJECT BECAUSE OF THOSE DEVELOPER WE SPLIT THOSE UP WE HAVE TO DEVELOPERS WORKING IT GRAY STAR -- IT AS WELL AS AFFIRMED AGREE STAR IS GOING TO DEVELOP A MARKET RATE PRODUCT -- BASICALLY SHOULD A STUDENT MARKET RATE HOUSING -- THAT'S GOING TO GO IN THERE A FIRM JUST GONNA DO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE FORTY SIXTY AND 80% OF A AYE MINE -- ALL TOTAL WILL HAVE OVER A THOUSAND RESIDENTS AT THAT LOCATION. AND THE REVENUE THAT WE GENERATE FROM THE MARKET RATE ONE HE IS -- IT IS IS GOING TO HAVE PROBABLY HELP WITH TRANSIT PASSES -- WERE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO STIMULATE RIDERSHIP. UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT WHEN WE ENTER INTO THE AFFORDABLE -- ARENA AS OPPOSED TO MARKET RATE. OF THEN LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP SOME SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE IN IN DOING THAT AND THE RATE DIFFERENCES. OR THE RETURN TO MTS -- BETWEEN THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS IS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT UP IN TERMS OF CERTAINLY A COMMUNITY PRIORITY -- BUT SECONDLY -- TO GENERATE RIDERSHIP FOR US -- THE NEXT ONE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIS PALM AVENUE TROLLEY IT'S ON THE UC SAN DIEGO BLUELINE AND WAY DOWN SOUTH ABOUT FOUR ACRES WE'VE GOT TO TO DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING THERE. NATIONAL COR WILL DO THE AFFORDABLE WANTED 23260% A WIDE AND MALAKIAN FEEL -- CORPORATION -- WILL DO THE OTHER WANTED ABOUT A HUNDRED UNITS AND IT'S GOING TO BE EIGHTY ONE TWO HUNDRED AND SO RIGHT IN THE ZONE THAT YOU ALL ARE ARE FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW I THINK BOTH DEVELOPMENTS ANTICIPATE ACCESS THE SUBSIDIES TO MAKE THIS THING WORK -- THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE BOARD'S IMPENDING DECISION -- TO USE PREVAILING WAGE SO I THINK THE HON IF THE 8210050% A I'M I CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THAT. STORE NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW -- BUT THAT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A MOBILITY ANOTHER. YOU KNOW -- OTHER. REALLY CONTEMPORARY THINGS FOR TRANSITS WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THE LAST ONE THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS RIGHT HERE IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO AT IN OUR OFFICES AT TWELFTH AND IMPERIAL. AND THAT'S OUR BUILDING THERE WERE ON THE NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR -- AND THE THE THE PROPERTIES TO THE RIGHT OF THAT WE HAVE OF ACQUIRED OVER THE LAST -- TEN YEARS -- WHEN PROPERTY WAS CHEAP -- BUT WE BOUGHT THOSE AND NOW THAT'S ALMOST A FULL BLOCK THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE A TRANSIT CENTER NOW THERE WE WANT TO EXPAND THAT TRANSIT CENTER BECAUSE THAT HOPE LOCATION IS BECOMING. A VERY POPULAR WITH A LOT OF NEW SERVICE. SO IN IN ITS. ON IMPERIAL -- TO THE NORTH FOURTEENTH TO THE EAST EAST TROLLEY TRACKS TO THE SOUTH. AND WE'D LIKE TO DEVELOP -- PROPERTY THERE WOULD PRIVATE DEVELOPERS ALSO BUILD OUT AN EXPANDED TRANSIT CENTER AND POSSIBLY EVEN SOME OFFICE SPACE -- THE SITE ANALYSIS WE DONE IS VERY EXCITING COULD BE UP TO FORTY SEVEN STORIES -- POTENTIAL FOR FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A PLUS OFFICE WE'RE GONNA BE WERE WORKING ON AN RFQ RIGHT NOW. TO GAIN DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS THIS SUMMER -- THIS COULD BE A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING -- BUT YOU KNOW WE ALSO WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. IT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CAN OCCUR IN STILL AT LEAST HAVE A POSITIVE RETURN TO US -- FOR UTILIZING THAT PROPERTY SO WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE GRANTS AVAILABLE AT LEAST FOR THE TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS -- THEY WE WANT TO DO THAT WILL TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF THAT -- HERE'S SOME OF THE MACHIN -- RENDERINGS THAT SHOWN YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE IT KIND OF ON THE ON THE THE RIGHT THERE WHERE THE CLOCK TOWER IS IN THE MTS TEN STORY BUILDING SO. THEY COULD REALLY BE SIZEABLE STRUCTURES -- IN JUST IN CONCLUSION -- YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE ARE LOOKING INTO GETTING TO THE FOR DOUBLE HOUSING -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHERE IS -- THINGS LIKE PREVAILING WAGE THAT WILL -- MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CREATE HOUSING THAT'S MARKETABLE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE -- SUBSIDIES AND WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA TAKE -- LESS OF A FINANCIAL GAIN -- THAN WE USED -- TO AND ALSO I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHENEVER AGENCIES ARE DOING -- THINGS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY US THEY REALLY NEED TO SUPPORT AT THE COMMUNITIES THEY RAN THE CITY'S -- LIKE SAN DIEGO WE LOOSE WE RELAX THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS ZONING REGULATIONS IT CETERA TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS WORK AND AND NOT TO OVERLOOK THESE PROJECTS WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO MAKE THINGS WORK. AND I THINK THAT'S EXCITING STUFF IT IS KIND OF EXCITING AS A FORMER BOARD MEMBER RIGHT SOME OF THESE THINGS STARTED DOES THAT MEAN PLANTS EFFECTED BUT TO SEE THAT WHAT'S. COMING THROUGH NOW IS IS IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE -- YEAH. I THINK I THINK POLITICIANS SHOULD -- CARDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE LESSON THAT YOU'RE LEARNING NOW AS YOU MOVE FORWARD SOMEBODY'S PROJECT SOME OF OUR APPROVAL YOU ALREADY HAVE -- DEVELOPERS ON BOARD AND YOU KIND OF GOING THROUGH SOMETHING STATE WILL BE IN THAT PROCESS -- BEFORE TOO MUCH LONGER -- IT IS LOOKING AT A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE YOU KIND IT GOT TO WHERE I WAS INTERESTED IN. THE THE BOARD IS MADE A POLICY DECISION TO PRIORITIZE VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME HOUSING ON THE SIDES BUT THAT'S NOT TO SCREW MIDDLE INCOME. PROPERTIES ISN'T IN THE CASE RIGHT NOW HE'S YEAH THAT'S CORRECT AND THE THE SENATE SIDE IS -- 420% AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW AT THE LOW LOW INCOME. BUT IT'S NOT TO EXCLUDE ANYTHING ELSE. OKAY SO A IN BECAUSE AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT WAS IN HOPES THAT THESE LOWER INCOME WRITERS WOULD BE MORE LIKE A LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE TRANSIT RIDERS I WAS KINDA. SOME OF THE TOP FIVE TO BE ON THE PUBLIC USE OF THE PROPERTY AND YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC. GOOD OF OF BUILDING MORE TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING I WELL I ALSO THINK THAT EIGHTY TO A 120% IS A GOOD TRANSIT MARKET. TO THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING OUT YEAH I MEAN I ABSOLUTELY THINK. SO -- YOU KNOW IT IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN WORK ON PROPERTY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED TO A BUNCH OF DEVELOPERS AND AND AND IF YOU KNOW I'M STILL HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WITH THE PREVAILING WAGE WERE STILL GONNA GET DEVELOPED. HEY YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF IT IS RATTLING OF SORTS A LITTLE BIT AND AND YOU KNOW THEY'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY. YEAH -- YOU KNOW I'D LIKE THAT AFFORDABLE -- WORKING -- MIDDLE INCOME LEVEL -- BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WORKING IN OUR LOWER THAT IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT NEED THE MOST HELP WITH WITH HOUSING ALSO YEAH. SO -- HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY THAT BECOMES PART OF IT IS SPECIALLY AT TWELVE IMPERIAL THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I'D APPRECIATE THIS FORTY SEVEN STORIES YOU CAN DO THAT MUCH THERE I MEAN THAT'S YEAH I MEAN YOU COULD DO A LOT WITH THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT ON YEAH -- ON THE GRANT FIELD TROLLEY STATION YOU MENTIONED THAT THE TWO PROJECTS WITHIN THE ONE PROJECT WHAT ARE THE SIZE OF THE UNIT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT -- HUNDRED FIFTY SIX UNITS ARE THOSE MULTI BEDROOM STUDIOS -- YEAH IT'S EVERYTHING FROM STUDIO TO THREE BEDROOM ON THE OF FARMS SIDE AND ON THE STUDENT ORIENTED HOUSING THEY'RE NOT CALLING A DORMITORY -- IT'S ACTUALLY -- MULTIPLE BEDROOMS UP TO FOUR BEDROOMS AROUND A SINGLE LIVING SPACE SO THAT'S WHY YOU GET SO MANY PEOPLE HOUSE AND SAID JUST SMALL AREA IT'S LIKE SOME OF THE SUITE. OF HOUSING THAT STF SHE WAS YEAH. YEAH I SEE THIS PROJECT IN THE PAST I WAS CURIOUS IF THAT'S THE OPPOSITE THAT. THE HOUSING TYPE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WAS GOT HERE BUT IN THE MIDDLE INCOME UNITS AT THE PALM AVENUE STATION I DON'T KNOW DOES A GREAT JOB -- AND THAT'S EARLIER THE PROCESS THE RIGHT YOU IT'S IT'S FURTHER ALONG THAN TWELVE AND IMPERIAL IT'S NOT AS FAR IS A GREAT FILM SO -- THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR NUMBERS RIGHT NOW -- AND YOU KNOW VERY SHORTLY WE HOPE TO SIGN A DDA WITH THEM OKAY BUT THEY ARE SEEKING TO ACCESS SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS FOR THAT MIDDLE INCOME IN ORDER TO MAKE IT -- PENCIL OUT AND THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT -- WE DO NEED IS OWNING AND UPS OWNING. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY PLAN IS OUTDATED AND WE'VE ALREADY BEEN WORKING WITH THE CITY ON THAT WHICH CAN BE PLAYED -- WOULD YOU REMEMBER. AFTER THAT'S ANOTHER SUGGEST. AND PALM -- OKAY OKAY -- AND THEN YOU HAVE A FOR A SITE IS TO FORTY SEVEN STORES NO NO -- IN ANTICIPATION OF TOUCHING YOUR EXISTING BUILDING RIGHT THE ECONOMIC SOME TOUCHING. THE EXISTING -- GIN MILLS BUILDING WOULDN'T WORK RIGHT WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN THAT -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY. THE MAJORITY OF IT IS IN CONTROL OF THE COUNTY. SO YOU'RE YOU SHARE DOLLARS RIGHT. WE HAVE THE GROUND FLOOR AND WE HAVE THE NINETEEN TEN THEY HAVE TO THROUGH. EIGHT SO -- JUST GIVE ME DREAM IF YOU CAN DO FORTY SEVEN STORES ACROSS THE STREET WHAT COULD YOU DO -- ON THAT JUST ABOUT THE VIEW IN THE LIBRARY AND THAT TELLS ME ON NOT IT'S FOR MY HOUSE A COUPLE. WE GOT TO HELP PEOPLE OUT -- OKAY -- THIS IS GOOD STUFF BUT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW HOW I CAN SAID HE BELIEVES A TENDENCY THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW WHEN WE DO -- AND I KNOW THAT OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE LOOKING ALONG THESE LINES IT'S JUST CERTAINLY HELPFUL TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT THIS CAN LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THE MIDDLE INCOME STUFF FROM HONG. THE STUDENT HOUSING TO GRANDVILLE -- YOU KNOW I WONDER ABOUT IT'LL BE ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES YOU HAVE BUILT ON THE RIVER WALK -- LIKE DO YOU IN THE RIVER WALK GOLF COURSE FOR PORTIONS OF THAT WE ONLY YEAH THAT'S THAT'S COMPLEX STORY RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF COMPOST OR THEY WANT TO PUT IT THE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO PUT A NEW STATION. YEAH AND WE'VE WORKED HARD -- TO TRY TO GET. OUR LAND. AS PART OF THAT PROJECT AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITY IN THE CITY'S WORKED WITH US. AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT WE ALL GET OUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN -- THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED BUT NOW AT LEAST WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT PROPERTY THROUGH THE RIVER WALK DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THAT WAS A LANDLOCKED. SO NOW WILL HAVE ACCESS OKAY AND AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WE WE'VE HAD THE DEVELOPERS AND I DON'T KNOW HALF A DOZEN TIMES -- TO TALK TO THEM SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE ON THAT. HOW DOES CONVERSATION KEEP GOING? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THE LARGEST CASH ABOUT FUTURE STATIONS EITHER THOSE ARE CREDIT EXTRACTION OR MAYBE LIKE THE ONE YOU JUST DESCRIBED -- BUT LOOKING AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU HAD INVENTORY OF EXISTING STATIONS BY THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST UNDER UTILIZED ONES -- DAD YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO A WEB LOG WITH OUR TO MAYBE THE POOR DISTRICT ENDING I THINK SOME OF YOUR STATIONS ARE SURROUNDED CLOSE ENOUGH TO POORLY AND BEGIN THE SORT OF OVER THIS ONGOING CONVERSATION OF PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES. FOR WHICH THE PUBLIC COULD USE A GREATER BENEFIT -- AND THAT YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE SOMEBODY MISSION VALLEY STATIONS -- THAT I KNOW ARE SURROUNDED BY FOR THE SUBURBAN STYLE RETAIL -- THAT YOU KNOW CAN I WONDER ABOUT WHAT WHAT THE THERE'S ANY OWNERSHIP STAKE THE U. HAPPY ON THE STATION -- YOU KNOW. NO SHADE ON THEIR BROTHERS ARE MORE BUT I MEAN I CAN BE DE IS CAN WE CAN WE GET SOMETHING MORE AT THAT STATION THAT WOULD BE TRANSIT ORIENTED -- YOU KNOW THE YOU YOU CATCH MY DRIFT AND YEAH SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOUR STAFF IS LOOKING AT THOSE EXISTING STATIONS NOT AND AND NOT ALLOWING THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS RISING RAIN AND WHATNOT WHICH ARE. VERY -- DATE PRESIDENT MINE -- BUT GOING BACK TO CITIES EXISTING STATIONS WHERE MORE CAN BE DONE I THINK IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. YEAH I THINK IT'S A MINDSET ALSO I MEAN WITH T. O. D.. YOU KNOW FOR FOR ME IT ALWAYS HAS A DIFFERENT MEETING BECAUSE WE RUN TRANSIT. BUT EVEN WHEN I SEE DEVELOPMENTS AND AND I SEE SOME OF THE DANCER STUFF LOCATED A FURTHER. FURTHER DISTANCE FROM IT WHEN YOU WANT THAT STUFF RIGHT THERE. SO THAT YOU HAVE THE GREATEST PROPENSITY FOR TRANSIT USE. I THINK IT'S LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE CAN. WE CAN DO TO TO TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE. ATTRACTIVE [INAUDIBLE] TRANSIT [INAUDIBLE] GREAT. AWESOME THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP -- OUR NEXT PANEL -- IS A PANEL -- ONE IF SHE COULD DEFINITELY OF THE LEAST LOW IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CITY CITY GOES DEVELOPMENT SERVICES DEPARTMENT. SHE'S GOING TO DISCUSS THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT SOME EXPERIENCE OF THE CITY STATE IS GOING TO IMPLEMENTING THIS ACT -- HE'S ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO SEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING CANADIAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MEMBER GLORIA AND A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY -- I I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS A LITTLE BIT FRAZZLED ABOUT THE PERMISSION MONEY ACT BECAUSE AND IT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS BORING BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT EXCITING AND IT'S GONNA BE GREAT -- SO YEAH NOT WORK IT'S NOT A DRY TOPIC ANYMORE -- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATIONAL I'M AN OFFER YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE TODAY TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS ON AND MIDDLE INCOME PRODUCTION. AND THEN -- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN JUST SOME IDEAS I HAD ABOUT PERMITS STREAMLINING IN GENERAL -- OPERATE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO'S AND DEVELOPMENT AND THAT A HOUSING UNITS BUILT PER DECADE YOU CAN SEE. FROM THE SLIDE THAT WE REALLY PEAKED IN THE SEVENTIES -- AND THAT DECLINE THAT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL DECADES LATER AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A NUMBER OF REASONS AND AVAILABILITY OF LAND AVAILABILITY IN LABOR AND COST OF MATERIALS THOSE ARE ALL THINGS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS PERMIT AND REGULATORY PROCESS. I WISH I HAD A CORRESPONDING SIDE THAT ACTUALLY SHOWED THE INCREASE OF REGULATIONS AND FEES THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED. TO AND THESE NUMBERS. I'LL MAKE THAT SIDE FOR THE NEXT PRESENTATION -- THIS THOUGH REALLY DEMONSTRATES THE GAP THAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SO THE MODERATE OR MIDDLE INCOME REALLY STANDS OUT I MEAN JUST TO HAVE A CONVOLUTED EUROS -- AND THAT BEING THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT AND WE'VE SEEN ACHIEVED IT THEN THE CITY. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST MIND BOGGLING AND WE REALLY DO WANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS WITHIN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO BECAUSE IF WE CAN REDUCE THE PRESSURE -- ON THE AFFORDABLE UNITS BY OPENING UP MORE AND MIDDLE INCOME UNITS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE THE INCOMES THAT CAN MOVE INTO THAT. EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TO A 120% AND MY AND SO -- WILL BE ABLE TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON AFFORDABLE UNITS IF WE INCREASE THESE NUMBERS -- SO WHAT ABOUT THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT WHAT DOES THIS DO WELL THIS IS A STATE ACT THAT REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS MY OWN TO MAKE DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. OR ON A QUASI JUDICIAL AND USE DECISIONS WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME MOMENT AND IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE CERTAINTY BOTH FOR THE DEVELOPER -- AND TO GETTING THEIR PROJECT APPROVED -- AND THEN ALSO FOR CITIES TO GIVE US SOME TOOLS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE WORK I AM SO REALLY YOU KNOW. WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT IS THAT IF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES FAILS TO ACT WITHIN CERTAIN TIME LIMITS IT COULD RESULT IN A PROJECT APPLICANT COMING IN AND JUST ALTERNATELY? BEING DEEMED APPROVED AN AUTOMATIC APPROVAL THE PROJECT IT SOUNDS GREAT AND AND EVERYONE'S DREAM EXCEPT FOR THE FOLKS THAT WANT TO ENSURE THAT -- SAFETY OF THE BUILDING AND THAT ADHERENCE TO LAND USE PLANS AND AND OTHER REGULATIONS -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT PERMITS STREAMLINING THOUGH BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT DIFFERENT THAT COST INPUTS AND REASONS WHY HOUSING GETS EXPENSIVE I DECIMATED THAT. 3240% OF THE COST OF EVERY UNIT REALLY IS THAT I'M REGULATION AND AND TIME TO PROCESS. SO. WHAT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS DONE IS PROVIDED -- INDEPTH REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR SAID MIDDLE PROCESS AND FOR APPLICATIONS SO THAT WE DON'T EVER FIND OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION SO WE FRONT LOAD THE INFORMATION. AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT -- THIS IS MORE OF A PROFIT RATHER THAN A HAND OUT BUT THIS IS A THIRTEEN PAGE MANUAL THAT WE'VE CREATED JUST TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH THAT PROJECTS THE MIDDLE REQUIREMENTS. THIS ISN'T EVEN THE REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES THIS IS THE THIRTEEN PAGE MANUAL HOW TO GET THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS SO -- WE REALLY DELVED INTO THE DETAILS TO HELP APPLICANTS UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED TO GIVE US BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS LOOK AT YOUR APPLICATION AND DEMAND COMPLETE. SO THAT WE DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE AND IT DOESN'T GET AUTOMATICALLY APPROVED. THE THING ABOUT THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT. THERE'S STILL A KEEN NOTICING REQUIREMENT SO HAVING THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THAT IF -- IT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THEIR APPLYING FOR A ZONE CHANGE OR OR SOMETHING THERE THERE ARE STILL PUBLIC NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT HAVE TO KEEP THE GENERAL PUBLIC INFORMED ABOUT THESE QUASI JUDICIAL DECISIONS. AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE EVALUATION THAT I'VE DONE WITHIN THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THE CITY MOST APPLICANTS ARE. ILL PREPARED TO DO THAT NOTICE SEEING IN THE TIME LINE AND OF WHICH THEY APPLY SO I ONLY SEE ONE PROJECT ACTUALLY INTEND TO USE THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT AND IT WAS -- NOT EVEN A HOUSING PROJECT IT WAS A TELECOM PROJECT -- AND THERE WAS A LAWSUIT BETWEEN THE CITY AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THEY DIDN'T DO THE ADEQUATE PUBLIC NOTICING IN ORDER FOR THEIR PROJECT TO BE DEEMED APPROVED. SO -- BUT LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS THIS IS WHY YOU'D WANT TO BE DEEMED APPROVED BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. VERY QUICKLY AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT THIS IS IN A LADDER WHEN WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE JUNGLE GYM OF PROCESS THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH -- BOTH A PRE MEETING AN APPLICATION A COMPLETE AS RUBIO ALL THE STAFF ANALYSIS AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- NOT A MINISTERIAL BUILDING PERMIT BUT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AN APPLICATION THAT WANTS TO INCREASE THE DENSITY ON A SITE. WE'VE GOT SICK WELL WE'VE GOT ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES WE'VE GOT LOTS OF TECHNICAL ANNOUNCES THAT WE REQUIRE BEFORE THE CITY CAN CERTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT. AND THEN ALL THIS LEADS UP TO A STAFF REPORT A HEARING AND THE ABILITY TO HEAL BOTH THE PROJECT TO AND DID OF OUR MENTAL PROCESS SO. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD REASON FOR THIS PROCESS BUT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF TIME. SO IN TERMS OF THAT ONE OF THE OBSTACLES TO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION REALLY IS THIS TIME TO PROCESS THE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS TO MAKE MORE PROJECTS BY RIGHT AND MINISTERIAL. AND IN AS MUCH AS THE STATE CAN DO THAT -- FOR AS AND AS A WAY THAT YOU HAVE HELPED A PREVIOUSLY WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DENSITY BONUS THINGS LIKE THAT -- IT'S BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL CITIES IN GENERAL NEED TO IDENTIFY WHERE -- RESTRICTIVE ZONING EXIST AND THEY NEED -- TO UP ZONE SO THAT WE CAN GET BETTER DENSITY SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE UNITS YOU SEEN -- HELLO OUR NUMBERS ARE AND HOW HIGH ARE TARGETS ARE. AND SO THAT. IN ITSELF IS A GOOD WAY TO GO WITH IT THE STATE HAS DONE A LOT -- THE MOVE FROM LEVEL OF SERVICE TO VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ANALYSIS FOR TRANSPORTATION THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG HELP BUT I'M SURE OUR OTHER PANELISTS LATER WE'LL WE'LL TOUCH ON THAT -- BUT THE IN DEPTH -- STUDIES AND ANALYSIS REQUIRED FOR SECRET IS CLOSURES AND DON'T GET ME WRONG I A YOU GUYS READ MY BIO I'M A TREE HUGGER WENT TO UC SANTA CRUZ I'M ALL ABOUT IT. AND BUT IT'S REALLY THE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT WE REQUIRE. ON A CONCEPTUAL PROJECT IN ORDER TO GET -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY SECRET SEE WHAT -- SO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING HOW IS IT DIFFERENT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHY WAS I TALKING ABOUT SEE BECAUSE SO MUCH WALL AND I DELAYED MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING AND I'VE HEARD A LOT OF DEVELOPERS LATELY TALK ABOUT MORE ATTAINABLE HOMES. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHAT WHAT CAN PEOPLE AFFORDABLE IF WE GIVE THEM WHAT IS THAT PRODUCT LOOK LIKE AND SO WE'RE SEEING DIFFERENT PRODUCT TAGS COME INTO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. IT'S LESS HOUSE IT'S MORE AMENITIES CITY SAN DIEGO -- REDUCED OUR PARKING REGULATIONS SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE LESS HOUSE MORE AMENITIES INTO THESE WALKABLE MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE ARE REALLY THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I'VE BEEN ENVISIONED -- BY A LOT OF PLANNERS AND FOR MANY YEARS SO IN TERMS OF OUR MY PERMITS REMINDING IDEAS ALONG WITH THAT AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT BUT THE POTENTIAL TO TAKE THE OLD SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE APPROACH WHICH WAS. REALLY HARD TO GET TO IT'S AN OLD STATE LAW COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN A MULTITUDE OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT SAID YOUR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ON TRANSIT MEETS THESE TWENTY SEVEN DIFFERENT CRITERIA. AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET SEEK WAS STREAMLINING WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PROCESS LIKE THIS FROM THE STATE THAT STILL GIVE PRUDENCE. TO SEE WHAT AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES BUT THAT CAN STREAMLINE IT SO MAYBE WE DROP THAT WAS DOWN FROM TWENTY SEVEN REQUIREMENTS TO FOUR OR FIVE INCORPORATE TRANSIT PRIORITY LOCATION EFFICIENCY AND THEN BRING IN THE NUMBERS OF THE AFFORDABILITY TO GET TO THE EIGHTY DID -- ONE TWENTY AND SO AND IN CLOSING I REALLY JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- AS MUCH THAT THE STATE CAN DO WHEN YOU PASS REGULATIONS TO GIVE US THAT ENVIRONMENTAL COVERAGE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PROCESS IT LOCALLY KEEP THE RULES SIMPLE TO FOLLOW FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE MORE COMPLEX THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL GAINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY. IT'S A GREAT PRESENTATION THANK YOU AND I ARE NOT TO BE JOB I THINK OF YOU OFTEN WERE PASSING LEGISLATION SACRAMENTO BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE A LOT OF WHAT WE DO END UP ON YOUR DESK. VERBAL MEDITATION AND YOUR LAST COMMENT IT'S A BABY A LEARNING LESSON I HAD OF YOU KNOW I THINK SOME TOOLS WE CREATE THEY'RE HELPFUL BUT WITHOUT THAT CLEARANCE -- IT DID IS IT IS IMMEDIATELY HELPFUL AND YOU KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS A CRISIS YEAH THIS IS NOTHING WE WANT TO SPEND. MORE TIME DOING SO YOU YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENT WAS HEARD IN HAND I DON'T KNOW I SPENT ON THAT BUT I I I GET IT. GREAT DAY YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT APPRECIATE THAT -- WITH REGARD TO THAT THE PRESENTATION ITSELF THANK YOU FOR SHOWING THESE NUMBERS -- IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION -- OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS I THANK THEM OFTEN WHEN EXPLAINED TO PEOPLE THE HOUSING CRISIS -- WHY THEY SEE CRANES AND CONSTRUCTION SITES BUT THEY DON'T FEEL ANY RELIEF FOR THEMSELVES I THINK IF YOU MEANT AND ALL THOSE ZEROES REALLY ILLUSTRATE WHY THE FOLKS THAT MIGHT? HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SHOP AT A TOWN HALL MEETING -- NOT FEEL AS THOUGH THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE RECEIVING THE PROGRESS OF WHAT'S BEING BILLED TO REALLY DOESN'T HAVE THEM IN MIND AND YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THEY'RE HERE. IN NUMBERS THAT ARE PRETTY HARD TO ARGUE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY I DON'T KNOW TO YOUR CONTACT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE. THESE ARE NOT UNIQUE TO SAN DIEGO THIS IS REALLY TRUE THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT -- ABSOLUTELY ANY OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT INDUSTRY IT IS EDUCATED ME YEAH THE THE THE PROFIT BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PROCESS THAT THE PROFIT IS AT THE ABOUT MARK OF MODERATE -- THE SUBSIDIES AT THE BELOW AND SO YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT OF WORK AND SEC WHICH YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA COME BACK TO YOU GUYS IS A CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET DEMAND IS SO WHY IS THIS NOT BEING FILLED IN. BUT AGAIN IT'S THE IT'S THE IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY OF PROCESS COUPLED WITH THE LACK OF SUBSIDY THAT JUST KINDA CONSPIRES TO CREATE THE ZEROS IN. ON THE TASK OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO TRY ZERO AND NO PUN INTENDED HOT ON THAT ON THAT DATA BACK COLUMN AND REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT TO TAKE TO TAKE THAT OVER AND HAVE SOME OF THOSE ABOVE MODERATE WHICH TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS MORE THAN THE MARKET CAN BEAR -- THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A FUND IT'S OF UNITS AT THAT LEVEL VACANCY AND WE BASIC FIRST MONTH FREE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF -- AND CONVERT THOSE DOWNTURN MORE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING WHERE I THINK THE RETURNS PUBLIC PRETTY PRETTY SUFFICIENT IT'S JUST A FRONT LOADING COSTS AND IF THINGS JUST MAKE IT PROHIBITS. THAT'S RIGHT THE ABOVE MODERATE IN THE END MARKET RATES. YOU KNOW WANTED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD TRICKLE DOWN AND HELP WITH SUPPLIES SO MUCH THAT WE CAN REALLY BOOST THEM THE MIDDLE INCOME SIDE AND WE HAVEN'T WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN THAT SO -- THAT THE LAND VALUES AND THINGS ARE THERE STILL ARTIFICIALLY HIGH AND THAT. WEEK WE HOPE THAT EVEN MORE SUPPLY IN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INCOME RANGES IS REALLY GOING TO LOSE THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS ST RIGHT THERE THIS IS NOT TO EXCUSE OR ACCEPT -- THE LOW PRODUCTION FOR VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME HOUSING CLEARLY MORE MUST BE DONE THERE BUT THE YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY CLEAR FORTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS AT THE VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME IN THIRTY THREE AT THE MIDDLE INCOME. IT'S NO WONDER THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ARE TRAPPED IN WHAT HOUSING THAT PROBABLY IS MORE BETTER SUITED TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THE NEXT RUNG. ON THE HOUSING -- I WOULD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX APARTMENT -- THAT IRAN -- I'M SURE IT WAS LUXURIOUS IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN JACK TRIPPER MRS ROPER LIVE THERE BUT IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN IT IS IT IS PROBABLY BETTER SUITED FOR SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT HURT WHEN A CALIFORNIA LEGISLATOR EARNS -- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE THAT LAST RUN BACK -- TO JEANS VISITATION OF WHAT IT TAKES -- TERMS OF INCOME ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY SOMETHING RIGHT AND THAT'S THAT'S THE DISCONNECT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEES ABOUT -- IT AGAIN YOUR TO PRESENTATIONS I THINK YEAH COME TOGETHER NICELY THAT DEPICT A PICTURE OF THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN YOU GO FOR THE BY EXPLAINING WHAT CAN BE DONE AND I WOULD POINT OUT THE CURRENT STREAMLINING ACTIVE MEMBER SERVICES FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AS WELL. IT IS -- A GOOD THAT YOUR GRAPH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION ONE WOULD ARGUES IS HELPING THAT MUCH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IF IT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND GET YOUR PRODUCTION -- PERSON THE BAR GRAPH CONTINUE TO FALL WE HAVE TO SAY THAT MAYBE THIS IS WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT LIKE ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WOULD ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT IT WAS SOME THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IN IN FOR EVERYONE WHO WE KNOW THERE'S A THIRD RAIL. THE SECOND HOUSE STUFF LIKE THAT BUT I HAVE NEVER PASSED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS PERFECT ON DAY. ONE AND THEY ONLY GETS MORE IN PERFECT WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME RIGHT AND SO IT IS IT AS YOU SAY AS A AS A COMMITTEE TREE HUGGER WHICH I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE AS WELL -- YOU KNOW IT ISN'T THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REMOVE OR ELIMINATE SOMETHING BUT IT IS TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING NEEDS UPDATING I DO THAT UPDATING OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND AND REALITIES ON THE GROUND -- I'M NOT SURE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AT THE MIDDLE INCOME PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WAS TO THE Q. LI IMPACTED AS IT IS NOW AND SO -- IT'S A GENERAL INVITATION FOR PEOPLE JOBS LIKE MY TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT WHICH IS -- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HOW TO GET TO THE ACTION PART WHICH IS WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WERE MAKING AND I LIKE A JUNGLE GYM REFERENCE -- THAT LATTER JUNGLE GYMS IT'S A FUN COMMITTEE HEARING -- BUT WHAT I THINK I HEARD YOU SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MORE RECENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS HELPFUL BUT IT'S NOT AS HELPFUL AS IT COULD BE. MAYBE THAT'S A LEGISLATIVE IDEA FOR THIS COULD BE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER -- FOR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. YEAH I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THAT WOULD KIND OF KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW AND WHERE WE ARE AND IN IN THE CRISIS LOOKING AT THOSE CRITERIA THAT REALLY ARE ABOUT THE PROJECTS THAT WE WANT TO SEE A LONG HIGH PERFORMING TRANSIT -- WHICH YOU KNOW IDEALLY IN OUR CITY IS ABOUT THAT TRANSIT THEIR RUNS EVERY DIED TEN MINUTES OR OR BETTER -- THAT IF WE COULD REDUCE THAT COMPLEXITY AND YOU KNOW I HAD THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ACTUALLY SAID WE'RE GONNA CALL THE MID COAST AND TRANSIT PRIORITY PROJECT. WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO STREAMLINE SO ARE PROJECTS ALONG THE MID COAST SO -- IF WE CAN REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY WE CAN BRING AYE I THINK THAT WE CAN GET THE PROJECTS THAT WE WANT IN A FASTER TIME PERIOD. WE SHOULD GET TO TALK ABOUT THAT OF THIS THIS COMMITTEES AS A SELECT COMMITTEE WERE REALLY -- COLLECTOR OF IDEAS -- THERE ARE INTENDED TO BE EVENTUALLY -- WANTED TO LEGISLATORS LEGISLATION AND WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF BILLS SO NOW THE HOUSING COMMISSION THE CITY SAN DIEGO -- AND OTHERS TO ACTUALLY CREATE LAWS OF FROM THIS COMMITTEE -- THIS -- AND SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS I THINK OF WELL CREATING THAT THE LIST OF IDEAS THAT WE CAN -- WORK ON IN THE FALL AND HOPEFULLY PRODUCTION -- IN THE NEW YEAR -- I WOULD WRAP UP -- I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T ASK YOU TO SO BE PREPARED FOR THIS BUT AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE STATE -- THE LAND TRUST -- THE MTS I KNOW THE CITY SAN DIEGO'S EMBARKING ON AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT ITS PROPERTY AND TO SEE WHAT IT MAY BE ABLE TO BRING TO BEAR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS A WHAT THE CITY IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT IS GENERALLY FOR THE VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME -- MARKET BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S THE SURPLUS PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING THAT IT CURRENTLY. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT -- OUT OF OUR TOTAL PROPERTIES MORE ONE OF THE LARGEST LANDOWNING MUNICIPALITIES AND WE'VE TARGETED ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND AND ARE PUTTING THOSE OUT AND WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE LOW TO LOW INCOME FOR THAT. IS -- CONTEMPLATION OF WORKING IN THE WORKFORCE SORT OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING FOR THOSE PROPERTIES. THAT YEAH I I I I WOULD NEED TO CHECK WITH OUR REAL ESTATE ASSETS DEPARTMENT BUT I BELIEVE SO. I JUST -- WOULD PUT OUT AGAIN AND GENERAL PLEA FOR WHOM I HEAR MOST FROM AND I THINK YOUR CHART AGAIN REALLY MAKES THE CASE FOR WHY THAT SHOULD BE AT LEAST A CONSIDERATION -- AND RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS NO SMALL TASK IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S A THERE'S A SUGGESTION OF COURSE I AND I THINK THAT'S HEALTHY YEAH IT'S A GOOD CONVERSATION -- BUT MUCH LIKE THE STATE'S CONVERSATION OF IDEAS SITES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THEY DON'T ALWAYS PAN OUT -- ALSO IF THOSE DON'T PAN OUT AS IDEAS FOR DEVELOPMENT PERHAPS THERE IS -- SOME OTHER -- FOR FOR VERY LOWER LOW INCOME PRESS OR OTHER USES THAT IN THERE -- AND I YOU KNOW GET WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN COORDINATE COLLECTIVELY -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE PROPERTIES A GREAT EXAMPLE -- THE STATE BUILDING DOWNTOWN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF ALL OF A LARGE PROPERTY NEXT TO A WHOLE LOT OF CITY PROPERTY. MAYBE THERE'S SOME CROSS COLLABORATION THAT'S KIND OF THE LEGISLATION EITHER USED AS INTENDED TO REALLY FORCE THAT CONVERSATION OF WHAT YOU CAN DO COLLABORATIVELY FOR MORE PUBLIC BENEFIT. ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW REGIONALLY ACROSS THE COUNTY I JUST THINK THERE'S SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE. TO DIG DEEP AND IDENTIFY THEM AND BUILD SUPPORT AROUND THEM SO THAT WE CAN AND BOOSTED INCOME PRODUCT -- TO START WITH THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WERE PRODUCING. WELL YOU HAVE A LEGISLATIVE AS WELL TO HELP ANYWAY HE CAN'T I WOULD JUST SAY AT LEAST BY YOU KNOW THE LONGTIME WATCHER CITY HALL. SEE A LOT OF YOUR PREDECESSORS IN THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE HI I'M AND IMPRESSED BY THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT I HAVE ABOUT YOU SPECIFICALLY IN THE LEADERSHIP OF YOUR DEPARTMENT -- I JUST A CRAZY KEEP GOING AT IT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE'RE FACING I IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE WORK DO YOU DO WITH THE STAFF THAT YOU HAVE DO EVERY DAY. HE SAID THAT YOU'RE HELPING SOLVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR THE GREAT MANY PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT I REALLY APPRECIATE ME TOO AND I HOPE YOU KEEP AT IT. MUCH APPRECIATED IT AND I THINK THAT THE COMMENTS ARE WELL THOSE ARE BY MY STAFF WHO WHICH IS WORK TIRELESSLY. TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WERE MORE MOVING AS FAST AS WE CAN TO GET THINGS PERMITTED GET THOSE UNITS ON THE GROUND WE HAVE GREAT LOCAL PARTNERS LIKE THE HOUSING COMMISSION. AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU GET A MIDDLE INCOME APPLICATIONS FOR THE TOP LIST OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH -- THAT BRINGS US TO OUR LAST PANEL OF THE AFTERNOON -- ANYWAYS WE SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST -- THIS IS -- A DISCUSSION ON NOT HOW GLAD HOUSING PRODUCTION CAN HELP CALIFORNIA MEET AT THIS IS KIND OF GOALS WE HAVE TO LOCAL EXPERTS. WHO ARE AMAZING INDIVIDUALS AND A CO CAPTAIN -- FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CRIME ACTION CAMPAIGN IN CODY WHO THE CITY SAID EAGLES CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HOUSING IN TRANSIT -- THIS AFTERNOON -- THEM THEN DIAGRAM OF THOSE TWO CIRCLES -- IS CLIMATE -- AND I THINK I SAID IT BEFORE BUT TO GET THEIRS BOB HOUSING IS THE MOST IS THE NORM IS THE LARGEST ISSUE FACING -- THE STATE GENERALLY TODAY I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT CLIMATE IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ALL HUMANITY -- AND THIS IS QUITE ESSENTIAL BIG GLOBALLY ACT LOCALLY SO WHAT CAN WE DO AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- TO TO BE POSITIVELY IMPACT THIS ISSUE AND BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FREE TIME IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE I GREATLY GIVEN TO THIS COMMITTEE. I'M FLOOR JEWELERS. GREAT. I MEAN I JUST HAVE TO START BY SAYING WE CANNOT FORGET THAT ACTUALLY WAS DURING YOUR TENURE AS MAYOR. THAT WE CREATED THE IDEA OF HAVING THAT SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT AND DIRECTOR AND SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THE CHARGE FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND A LOT. DREAM IT COMES TO LAST -- SO THANK YOU PHONE NUMBER GLORIA FOR ALLOWING US TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND ADDRESSING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CLIMATE AND HOUSING. AT OUR MISSION IT COME ACTION CAMPAIGN SIMPLE. STOP THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND MAKE CLIMATE A TOP PRIORITY FOR POLICY MAKERS EVERYWHERE UNTIL I MISSION IS ACHIEVED. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY NO ONE CAN TOUCH OUR TREE HUGGER CREDENTIALS IN THIS ROUND. I KNEW I WAS THINKING CYCLE FARTHER NOT. AS THIS MEANS TACKLING HOUSING POLICY BECAUSE HOUSING POLICY IS CLIMATE POLICY HOW WE BUILD AND RETROFIT OUR COMMUNITIES IS KEY TO SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. ALSO KEY IS HOW WE ENSURE THAT THE HOUSING WE BUILD IS AFFORDABLE TO MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. AS SENDING HAS REPORTED AND THE STATISTIC MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN CITED OF THE NEW HOUSING BILLS SINCE TWENTY TEN ABOUT 76% IS CONSIDERED OUT OF REACH FOR FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WE BELIEVE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS AND IT REINFORCES WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN SAID TODAY. THE TACKLES BUT THE CLIMATE AND HOUSING CRISIS FOR THE MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASS AND HOPEFULLY LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO IS TO CREATE POLICIES THAT RESULT IN MORE BALANCED AND VERY HOUSING SUPPLY IN URBAN AREAS. ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS TRADITIONALLY CENTERED AROUND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IF WE FOCUS ON BUILDING A VARIETY OF HONG CHOICES LIKE DUPLEXES TRI PLEX IS IMPORT TAXES AND RESIDENTIAL CITY NEIGHBORHOODS. THESE KINDS OF MID CITY HOMES COULD HELP KERR PRICES IN GIVE MODERATE INCOME WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL HOUSEHOLDS LIKE SENIORS AND YOUNG COUPLES MORE AFFORDABLE OPTIONS. THIS WILL ALSO HELP ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN TWO WAYS. NUMBER ONE SMALLER HOMES MEANS LESS CARBON POLLUTION. SIDELINE AND THINK BLANK I THINK TANK IN SEATTLE TO STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES A FEW BILL TO BLOCK THEY TO STUDY BUT HIS BILL TO BLOCK OF JUST SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET A BILL TO BLOCK. WITH DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPE SUCH AS A DUPLEX AND TRIPLEX AND FOR BY FROM THE OTHER SIDE IT IS POSSIBLE TO CUT ENERGY USE 20%. AN RTC ANOTHER NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISM GOING TO GET ORGANIZATION SAYS THAT NO OTHER SECTOR OFFERS A HIGHER POTENTIAL. FOR SINGLE SOURCE OF ENERGY REDUCTION THAN RESIDENTIAL EFFICIENCY WHICH HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF THE HOME GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HOMES. THEY DON'T USE ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO HEAT AND COOL THE ROOMS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ENERGIES GOES UP. NUMBER TWO INTEL CAN ALSO REDUCE DRIVING. AND SAVE EVERYONE MONEY. THE KIND OF BENEFITS GROW MAY INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL TRANSPORTATION SAVINGS OF LETTING PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER TO JOBS AND THE SHOPS. ARE LIVING WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT TO GET THEM TO THEIR DESTINATIONS. ANOTHER SITE SILENCE ON MY GO TO THINK TANKS ANOTHER SITE WHEN FIGURE SAYS THAT BOOSTING THE NUMBER OF HOMES ON RESIDENTIAL BLOCKS BY ONE THIRD. CORRELATES WITH A DROP OF ABOUT A THOUSAND MILES DRIVEN PER YEAR PER HOUSEHOLD. A 5% DROP EVEN AFTER CORRECTING FOR HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND INCOME. SO WHAT WE KNOW IS A DENSE WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE CENTERED PLANNING AND MULTI MODAL TRANSIT NETWORKS MEAN THAT WE CAN SPEND LESS TIME COMMUTING IN OUR CARS. AND CONTRIBUTING TO DIRTY AIR AND CARBON POLLUTION. ALSO HELPING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND CREATING CONNECTED COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO HAVE. TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES OF THE PAST WITH. THE INEQUITIES OF PAST ZONING AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PRACTICES BEEN LOCKED OUT OPPORTUNITY IN PROMISE FOR MANY FAMILIES AND STEAD CREATE THE CLEAN HEALTHY VIBRANT. DIVERSE HUBS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE. GIVEN THE FUTURE POTENTIAL FOR AND FILL THE REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND MAKE OUR REGION MORE AFFORDABLE WE SUPPORT POLICIES PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS THAT ALLOW INCENTIVIZE INFILL DIFFERENT TYPES SIZES AND COST. IN FACT WE KNOW WE CANNOT MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND UNLESS AND UNTIL WE EMPLOYMENT OR CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE HOUSING SUPPLY OPTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA KNOWS MORE THAN ANYBODY. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS AN AMBITIOUS CLIMATE PLAN. LEGALLY BINDING. BUT ALMOST MATCHES THE AMBITION OF THE STATE'S COMMON PLAN THE CITY MUST REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE STATE KIND OF PLAN GOES OUT FARTHER IN TIME AND THEY AIM TO REDUCE TO DE CARBONIZED 80% BY. TWENTY FIFTY AND ONE OF THE LAST ACTS OF GOVERNOR BROWN WAS TO PASS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ACTUALLY HIT CARMEN NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY TASK BUT A NECESSARY. ONE FOR US LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION REMAINS THE LARGEST DRIVER CARBON EMISSIONS AND THOSE EMISSIONS ARE ONLY GOING TO GO UP. IT REMAINS OUR MOST VEXING CHALLENGE. TO TURN THIS TREND AROUND WE NEED A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN HOW COMMUTERS GET TO WORK. AND A REDUCTION IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE TO DRIVE. THIS WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF WE BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY YOUR TRANSIT AND JOBS. ONE OF THE MAIN STRATEGIES THE CITY HAS CITED TO REACH THOSE GOALS HAS BEEN UPDATING COMMUNITY PLANS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. MOSTLY FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES TO UP SOME TO ALLOW MORE AND FILL I'M HERE WITH HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CITY IS BASED HAS FACED AND STILL FACING SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK FROM CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ABOUT UPS OWNING. EVEN BIKE LANES AND THE CITY HAS OFTEN AND I'M YOU KNOW SOMEONE UNDERSTANDABLY GIVEN POLITICAL REALITIES CAPITULATED TO THESE COMMUNITY DEMANDS. AS A RESULT HOWEVER OUR COMMUNITY PLANS. ART UPDATE CAN YOU PLANS ARE STILL NOT ZONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MEET OUR CAPITALS AND THAT'S JUST BASED ON DATA AND ANALYSIS THAT THE CITY PRODUCES. ON A POSITIVE NOTE HAS. AT LEAST HAS MENTIONED THE CITY OF PASSAGE WHAT POLICIES LIKE THE DENSITY BONUS AND REDUCE NEW PARKING. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WERE FINALLY DISCUSSING AT SOME REAL TRANSIT SOLUTIONS REGIONALLY. BUT TAKEN TOGETHER WE ARE STILL NOT ON TRACK. TO REACH OUR OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND WE'RE WE'RE JUST NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES. THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT ARE COUNTY. CONTINUES TO PRODUCE PROP WRITE CHECKS ENCOURAGES DEVELOPERS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BUILDING OUT. NOT UP. THIS MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO PERSUADE DEVELOPERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD AND FILL IN CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT MEET HOUSING NEEDS FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS. AND IT THREATENS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CARBON REDUCTION GOALS AND THREATENS AIR QUALITY. AT THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH. WORSE IT MUST BE NOTED THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT FOR THE MIDDLE OF WORKING CLASS. HELLO AND COST OF THESE HOMES THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT IS WHY WE ARE OPEN AND INTERESTED IN STATEWIDE POLICIES THAT WILL ENSURE WE ARE CREATING SUFFICIENT UP ZONING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTIPLE HOUSING TYPES. WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE SUPPORT AND AGREED WITH THE NEED. FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION ANTENNA PROTECTIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS WORKS AND HOUSING POLICY. WE MUST WORK HAND IN HAND WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING TO KEEP FAMILIES AND HOMES PREVENT DISPLACEMENT AND MINIMIZE GENTRIFICATION. WE MUST FOCUS NOT JUST ON MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING BUT ALSO ON VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION AND WE KNOW YOU HAVE STATED THIS IS A COMMITMENT OF YOURS AND WE KNOW IT'S PARTY YOUR HEART AND SOUL. TO TO FOCUS ON THAT BUT WE AT A PUBLIC -- SITTING WE JUST WANT TO BRING IN RE REINFORCE OUR COMMITMENT TO ALL HOUSING SUPPLY. NON VOICE -- OPPORTUNITIES. FINALLY WE HAVE COME ACTION CAN PAIN ARE NOT EXPERTS IN HOUSING POLICY. AND IT IS CHALLENGING TO NAVIGATE THIS VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT. BUT WE ARE ACT WE ARE EXPERTS IN KNOWING WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES CLIMATE SAFE AND CLIMATE READY. INFILL HOUSING SUPPLY DIFFERENT TYPES COST AND LEVELS IS ESSENTIAL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU TO SECURE A CLIMATE FRIENDLY FUTURE AND BILL MAHER INFILL HOUSING THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M CODY WHO WENT ON THE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ON THAT. THE NEWS THE STATE ABILITY DEPARTMENT THINKING ABOUT I FEEL LIKE -- THE LIKE THE CLOSER OF THE DAY I'M GONNA ZOOM OUT A LITTLE BIT -- AND SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND AND YOU'VE HEARD AND IS JUST TO KIND OF MAKE THE NEXUS CONNECTION HERE CLIMATE. ACTION -- SO WE DON'T TO DOES THE CALLS THAT WE DOCTORED AND VERY AMBITIOUS CLIMATE ACTION PLAN IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT IS LEGALLY BINDING -- AND COMMIT FOR THIRTY TO REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS BY 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE ACTUALLY ARE IN THE MIDST OF DOING AN UPDATE. ON BASS AND ALL THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE STATE LEVEL -- AND LOCAL POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES AND MARKET CHANGES AS WELL -- IT IT'S I GET ASKED A LOT WE REPORT ON THE ARE CLIMB ACTUAL PLAN ANNUALLY YOU SEE THAT LAST THREE COVERS OF THE REPORT HERE -- AND I GET ASKED A LOT IS NOT A LOT OF REPORTING YOU KNOW TOO MUCH TO TO SEE AN BENITO MOVE -- AND ARE YOU AFRAID TO PUT OUT DATA THAT SHOWS WHERE YOUR DEFICIENT AND THAT'S I FEEL LIKE A BIG PART OF MY JOB IS TO BE VERY HONEST AND AN OPEN WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHERE WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND WHERE WE ARE DEFICIENT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS REPORT DOESN WE TEND TO DO IT IN A VERY PUBLIC FRIENDLY WAYS THAT? FOLKS ACTUALLY WILL READ IT. AND SO DO. TO REITERATE THE POINT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY THIS THIS IS THE SOURCES OF OUR MISSIONS FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. YOU SEE THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN THE FIRST PART THE SECOND OF FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S ANNUAL AFTER THAT. SO WE'VE SEEN SOME PROGRESS -- BUT IT'S SAD BECOMING A LITTLE BIT MORE MARGINAL AS WE'VE CAPTURED FROM THE LOW HANGING FRUIT ONE POOR THING TO LOOK AT HERE IS THAT. THE DARK BLUE BAR ON THE BOTTOM NOT AS OUR TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS THOSE FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED THIS IS A BIG SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. FOR THE CITY AND FOR PRETTY MUCH THIS LOOKS SIMILAR ACROSS THE STATE AND FOR THE STATE ITSELF. THE TRANSPORTATION AND PEOPLE GETTING TO AND FROM HOME AND WORK IS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW HOW IT HIGHLIGHTS ARE AND REPORT AS WELL WHAT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION TODAY BUT WE DO -- PUBLISH ALL THE DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT WE HAVE HERE. I THINK IT'S EITHER JUST ONE POINTING TO SHOW HERE. ARE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH OUR GOALS WERE ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. BUT BY NO MEANS ARE WE CAN WE REST ON OUR LAURELS OR ARE SET BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND JUST BECAUSE RATING ARE GREENHOUSE GAS CALLS IT DOESN'T MEAN READING ALL THE OTHER GOALS THAT WE WE NEED TO SEE. HOW WE HAVE DEFINITELY CAPTURED SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT MOVING FORWARD -- WE TRACK ARE CLIMB ACTUAL PLAN HERE AS YOU COULD SEE BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UNFORTUNATELY FOLKS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT DAILY -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY CAN MEASURE OR FEEL OR UNDERSTAND BUT WHAT WE DO TRACK AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT YOU SEE HERE SO -- WERE IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE CLIMATE ACTION WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPROVING HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR FOLKS. AND WERE PROVIDING CLEANER AND HOPEFULLY CHEAPER ENERGY TO OUR CITIZENS WERE PLANTING MORE TREES. I'M WERE INCREASING COST SAVINGS THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO CARE ABOUT -- AND THAT'S REALLY I I I HOPE IT'S THE NOT SHOCKING TO ANYBODY HERE BUT WE'RE NOT NOT ACTUALLY SOLVING CLIMATE CHANGE WITH OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. BUT SHOULD WE SHOULD BE AND ARE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR SAN DIEGANS. SO THIS IS THE BEST ACTION OF A REPORT THAT LOOKS AT OUR BIKING WALKING TRANSIT IN LAND USE MEASURES AND THAT'S REALLY ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND AND I WON'T DWELL ON THIS FLIGHT BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE'RE NEAR THE END. BUT YOU COULD SEE WERE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT WERE OBVIOUS PLAN WAS AND WHERE WE ARE THE LATEST REPORTS AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND THEY WEREN'T OUR NUMBERS ARE NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AT AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING IT TAKES THE PARTNERS IN. THIS ROOM AND ELSEWHERE. FROM ALL OF US HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS BUT WE CONTINUE TO REPORT THEM AS BEST WE CAN AND ALSO TRY TO GET BETTER DATA BECAUSE THE STUFF IS REALLY THAT EASY TO MEASURE -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT WE TRY TO DEMONSTRATE AS WELL OF THAT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF GOING BACK TO THAT. QUALITY OF LIFE WE LOOK AT OUR ECONOMY AS A AS A REGION AS A CITY OR ITS GETTING CLEANER I MEAN THAT'S A BENEFIT TO ALL OF US. AND JOB GROWTH IN THESE SECTORS ARE ALSO IMPROVING SO YOU AND THEN WHEN THE GENERAL CLIMATE CATEGORY. JOB GROWTH IS 13% -- WHICH IS FAR FASTER THAN THE OVERALL JOB GROWTH IN OUR ECONOMY LOCALLY IS THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER BENEFITS. TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE -- WITH CLIMATE ACTION BRING THAT NEXUS BACK TO CLIMATE ACTION HOUSING -- AND THERE'S A FAX HERE AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME ANYMORE TODAY SO I WON'T GO THROUGH THEM TOO MUCH BUT AND I I THERE'S SEND YOU CAN SPEND A GOOD MAJORITY OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND THAT'S THAT'S A BIG **** SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND CLIMATE. ACTION IS A TOOL -- IT'S NOT A FRINGE ISSUE IT'S ACTUALLY A DIRECT TOOL TO BE USED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- I AND READING THROUGH THESE REPORTS AND PULLING SOME OF THE DATA TOGETHER HERE -- WEREN'T WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASED -- RIDERSHIP AND MIDDLE INCOME WRITERS -- I THINK ANOTHER CITIES NEW YORK IT'S NOT VERY STIGMATIZE TO WRITE TRANSIT IF YOU'RE MIDDLE OR UPPER INCOME BUT HERE IT SEEMS TO BE. JUST NOW CATCHING ON THAT IT'S KIND OF A COOL THING TO DO. I'M MORE EFFICIENT THING TO DO. AND OF THE CITY OF CITY PLANNERS AND AND FOLKS WORKING LOCALLY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE CITY SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE FUTURE NOT JUST THE FOLKS THAT ALREADY LIVE HERE COME. TO PUBLIC MEETINGS AND AND SO WE HAVE TO UNDO SOME OF THE POLICIES OF THE PAST. THE THREE'S COMPANY ERA POLICIES MAYBE AREN'T WORKING SO WELL FOR THE GOAL THAT WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS IN THAT THE NEXT GENERATION THAT IS LIVING HERE NOW I'M GOING TO BE LIVING HERE. AND THEY WANT TRANSPORTATION CHOICES FOLKS DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO DRIVE A LOAN TO BRING TWO THOUSAND POUNDS OF STEEL WITH THEM AND PARK IT ON THE STREET WHILE THEY'RE AT WORK ALL DAY. I WANT OPTIONS IN THE SPACES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK ARE CLIMATE ACTION IS OF THAT BIG TOOL THAT HAS REALLY TRIGGERED AND CREATE A TIPPING POINT TO PUSH THESE. INITIATIVES FORWARD SO WORKING TOGETHER TO ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THEN AND EXPERTISE. YOU FOR TODAY AT ALL FOR THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HEAD OF THE CITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. GREAT PRESENTATION THANK YOU CODY I LOVE THIS LAST LINE THE PREVIOUS. HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE WE HAD -- CALLING FROM SANTA COMMON PRESENTS SOME OF THIS DATA IN IN GREAT DEPTH -- TO MAKE THE CONNECTIONS THAT EXACTLY YOUR BULLET POINTS HERE MAKE IN TERMS OF THIS IS A TRUE DRIVER OF AFFORDABILITY IN THE STATE ARE NOT -- THAT THERE IS A STIGMA AROUND THIS EXTRA QUESTIONS RIGHT TS ABOUT THE BOARD POLICY AROUND FOCUSING ON THE HOUSING THAT COULD BE ON THE SIDE TO A PARTICULAR INCOME LEVEL WHICH IS CERTAINLY NEEDED -- BUT REALLY TRYING TO EXPRESS THIS NOT BEING SOLELY. FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS BUT REALLY FOR EVERYONE IF WE BEFORE TO GET THESE GOALS AS THE COLD MACHINE WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR OF OUR EMISSIONS COME FROM FROM OUR TRANSIT NETWORK -- I PRIVATE DONATIONS BUT I THOUGHT I THINK BECAUSE HOME HE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ON POINT AND I WANT I WANTED SPACE BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- SOMETHING FOR THE PUBLIC TO SAY TO TO KNOW WE HAVE AN ANNUAL RETREAT IS LEGISLATORS PROBABLY ALL YOU HAVE IS YOU KNOW JOBS TO YOU GOT TO YOU KNOW GET TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW SORT OF WORKSHOP WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO FOR THE YEAR -- ARE ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS DID THAT BACK IN FEBRUARY -- WE'RE SIXTY ONE MEMBERS LARGE OF ANY NUMBER LEGISLATURE SO YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF UP THE THOUGHT OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THESE ONE HOUSE. AND WE DIVIDED UP BECAUSE WE'RE TOO BIG TO BE IN ONE GROUP COLLECTIVELY -- IT'S SORT OF SPOKE WITH SMALLER GROUPS ABOUT WHAT WE THOUGHT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. YEAH IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT PART OF DO YOU COME FROM NORTH SOUTH COASTAL INLAND BAD BLUE OR PURPLE WHEN WE ALL RECONVENE ALMOST TO A PERSON IN EVERYONE'S TOP CONCERN WAS HOUSING. AND CLIMATE ENDED UP BEING IN THE TOP THE BED SO -- IT'D BE A REALLY SPEAKS TO THIS NEXUS OF WHY WE WANTED THIS PARTICULAR PANEL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HOUSE IS A TOP CONCERN IS WHAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT. CLEAN BUT IT REALLY DOES A WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT PEOPLE BUT YOU DON'T SEE DOES END UP BEING PRIORITIZE I CAN I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER TIME SOME OF COMPLAIN TO ME ABOUT A POTHOLE. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING COMPLAIN TO ABOUT A PIPE OR ANYTHING UNDER THE ROAD ITSELF ALTHOUGH BOTH THE PROBABLY IN DISREPAIR -- IT BUT HE IS IF YOU CAN'T SEE YOU KNOW PRIORITIZE IT INTO WHAT HE PURPOSEFUL WITH THIS PANEL WILL BE ELEVATING BOTH THIS ISSUE GENERALLY. BUT IT REALLY IS TAXES -- TO HOUSING AND IS TRICKLE AFFECTED TO TRANSIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED -- I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT THE I'VE REVIEW -- HELLO I'M SORRY THAT THAT TO FINISH THE CONVERSATION I THINK WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING IT ISN'T ABOUT TRICKLE DOWN -- HOUSING DERIAN AYE PC MAKING THAT AS A PART OF THE RECORD FOR THIS HEARING I WANT TO BE EXPRESSED ABOUT IT IS WELL YOU KNOW IT IS ABOUT -- MORE HOMES COUPLE WITH TENET PROTECTIONS COUPLED WITH FUNDING TO ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE THIS TIME WHETHER IT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS THE COMMUNITY AMENITIES ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER I THINK IS HOW CAN WE ESTABLISHED OF THE LATTER IN A FUNCTIONAL HOUSING ECONOMY. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ONE CURRENTLY RIGHT -- IN SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT IT'S PRODUCTION IT REALLY ALL LEVELS INCLUDING THE UPPER AND BECAUSE WHICH FOLKS IN PLACE THE TWO BUT IT'S RECOGNIZING THE INEQUITY. IN EQUITY OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH IS THERE'S NO PRODUCTION THE MIDDLE AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AT THE VERY LOW IN AND SO FOR GOING TO HANDLE THIS PROBLEM EQUITABLY REQUIRES EVERYTHING. THAT YOU SAY TED DISPLACEMENT ON STUFF ARE REAL ISSUES -- IN THAT EVERYONE HAS TO BENEFIT -- IF WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE NEW INCENTIVES A NEW. NEW I'M CONVINCED MY QUESTION I GUESS FOR BOTH OF YOU AS WE WRAP UP FROM PEOPLE AND THE WAY YOU SAID WHAT COULD THE LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP POSITIVELY IMPACT HOUSING PRODUCTION. OF WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IT DIRECTLY IMPACTS KLEIN IT -- EIGHTY HEARD AT LEAST TALK ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL -- AND THEN THE TO SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE A DAY IN THE PERMITS FREE MONEY ACT YOU HEARD -- THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF THE LAND TRUSTS TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN -- SUBSIDIES WHAT WOULD YOU SEE AS BEING THINGS THAT MIGHT COME TO MIND WE SHOULD SPEND THE NEXT NUMBER OF MONTHS DEVELOPING A POTENTIALLY INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION. IN. TWENTY TWENTY CONTROVERSIAL. YEAH -- KNOWING HE WILL BE. YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE WORSE FOR THE MAYOR'S I'M NOT SURE WHAT SHE'S ALLOWED TO SAY BUT I PERSONALLY THINK -- YOU KNOW VERY CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT BUT SB FIFTY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MORE SERIOUSLY AND OVER YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS BUT LIKE I POINTED OUT UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATES THEY'RE NOT A ZONING SUFFICIENTLY FOR US TO MEET THE KIND OF PLAN GOALS AND ARE CLEMENTINE. ONLY GOES TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET A CARBON NEUTRALITY SO WE YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR CURRENT COMMUNITY PLANS. SO IT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH NOW LOOKING AT THE CHEMICALS AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE SO I I DO FEEL. I'M STILL BIG BELIEVER AND LOCAL PROCESS AND ENGAGEMENT AS YOU KNOW I'M I GO TO THE SCREEN PLANNING MEETINGS I ENGAGE I BELIEVE IN. LOCAL CONTROL AND ALL THAT BUT THE SAME TIME IF THERE'S A GAP I THINK SOME STATE -- POLICIES AND REGULATIONS -- MIGHT BE NEEDED AND ANYTHING AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT A BILL AROUND THIS COULD LOOK LIKE. BUT ANYTHING TO STOP SPRAWL. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO I MEAN YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE PORTLAND HAS URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY OF ANY OTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TO STATEWIDE LEVEL BUT IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING ON THE GROUND. I THINK BEING THE FASTER ON THE WILD HEART ISSUES AS WELL RIGHT NOW. TO AND I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK AND GET A HIGHER LEVEL OF ANY ANY LEGISLATION AND AND SUBSEQUENT FUNDING THAT COMES DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL FROM THE STATE. ON ON ANY OF THESE HOUSING ISSUES CAN BE TIED TO OUR HAVE STRINGS ATTACHED THAT SAY IF YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION DOESN'T HAVE A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OR IF YOU ARE HITTING THE X. Y. Z. POLICIES. THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING AND THAT'S A BIG A HOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO WANT. TO WHAT ARE THEY BELIEVE IN THIS AND REALLY SUPPORTED OR WHETHER I DO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE. TO DOESN'T MATTER WHY THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AS LONG AS THEY ARE. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT BOTH THAT THAT'S OKAY FEEDBACK AND I THINK TO GET THAT LAST PART WHERE. THE GOVERNOR HAS REALLY BEEN INTERESTED IN TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL CITIES TO DO MORE FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AGAIN THIS IS WHY THIS IS ON OUR AGENDA IS A THERE IS A CLEARLY. TO KINDA SO SUCH A HOUSING PRODUCTION BUT ABOUT THAT AND YOU DID EXACTLY RIGHT ON AYE AYE YOU GET TO COMMIT TO MEMORY BUT THE NEW -- THE ACRONYM FOR WILDFIRE INTERFACE AREAS I MEAN THEY START TO SPEAK TO GET WHERE SHOULD -- NEW HOUSING BE PRIORITIZED ARE PROHIBITED -- THE GIVEN EXTREME COSTS TO TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS OF THE WILDFIRES I THINK WE STARTED IT -- REALLY GREAT THAT I HAVE AN APARTMENT CONVERSATION WHAT WILL WE OR SOMETHING CALLED CAN MAKE ONE FINAL COMMENT JUST TO ECHO. WHAT SHE REYES AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER COMMENT -- AS A MEMBER OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WE ARE BEGINNING TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE I BELIEVE AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHERE THE STATE DOLLARS GO. AND WHETHER THOSE DOLLARS ARE TIED TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE PLAN FOR THE STATE'S KIND OF GOALS FOR THE FIRST TIME SO I CLOSE LIKE OR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. SO -- IT'LL BE INTERESTING BUT I THINK THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A HELPFUL DATA POINTS TO SEEK TO POTENTIALLY TIED DOLLARS. TO LOCAL REGIONS BASED ON ONE OF THEIR IMPROVING ON NOT IMPROVING CLIMATE. ELECTIONS I DOES A GREAT SORT OF GENERALIZED GOES ON HOW WE TO SAY OPERATIONALIZE SOME OF THOSE INTO POLICY BUT THAT'S PART OF WHY WE HAVE -- AMAZING STAFF AND AND GREAT ATTORNEYS AND OTHER FOLKS TO MAYBE CAN HELP US FIGURE IT OUT -- AND AND THE CALL YOU YOU HAD A BUNCH OF INSTEAD OF A LARGE CONVERSATION LEGISLATURE THIS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH LOCAL CONTROL DO WE LEAVE IT HOW MUCH IS A STATE PARTY. CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS IS A MASSIVE STATEWIDE ISSUE NO ONE CITIES GOING TO SOLVE IT EVERY CITY HAS TO PARTICIPATE IN A AND I THINK GENERALLY SANDY WAS TRYING TO GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YOU HEARD FROM -- THE STAFF BEFORE WERE NOT MEETING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT WE ARE TRYING THAT IS HONESTLY TRUE OF EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. AND SO THAT DELICATE BALANCE OR ANYTHING YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH -- OTHERS ARE UTILIZING FEAR TRYING SCARED -- THIS CONVERSATION I ONE MOMENT FROM IT -- WE HAVE TO DO IT -- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ASKING IF ANYONE IS SORT OF A CITY COUNCIL NO IF YOU ASK NEIGHBORHOOD TO TAKE A NEW DEVELOPMENT HAS TO THE EXPECTATION THAT OTHERS ARE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I THINK THIS CONVERSATION IS ABOUT -- THAT SB FIFTY IS VERY ONGOING CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK SO THAT THE AUTHOR -- BUT OTHERS I DON'T SEE IT AS A AS A AS A DONE DEAL -- I THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSING REFINED HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT WHAT AWAITED STILL POWER CITIES TO MAKE LOCAL DECISIONS I THINK THAT GENERALLY IS THE BEST PLACE. BUT THINK IT'S CHEAPER TO YOUR POINT TO HAVE YOU MEET BROADER BIGGER GOALS. PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO AND AS I ALREADY SAID EARLIER I THINK IT'S THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF IN SAN DIEGO LEADS AND WITH REGARD TO THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. SAID IT WAS THE MEETING FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW IN THIS REGARD OTHER COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE CROSS COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD ARE FOLLOWING. THESE EXTREMELY CITING AND FOR THE STATE FOLKS ARE HERE IN THE ROOM -- WHO ARE JUST BUSY IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE DAY -- THE HOPE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND AND AND AND THE PARK -- THESE TWO WOMEN -- IN THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE LOCALLY IS POTENTIALLY A CLASS LEADING A WORK THAT CAN BE EMULATED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HOPEFULLY EXPORTED ELSEWHERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD HAS SO THOSE CALIFORNIA SO GOES THE REST NATION I THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THIS BRINGS US TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT A PORTION OF OUR AGENDA I HAVE ONE SPEAKERS LIVE ACTUALLY DIDN'T CLEARLY ARTICULATED WE HOUSE SPEAKER SLIP SO OF ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE PLEASE COME UP WITH A WERE STILL FILMING RECORDING ALL THIS. SEASON BALLING UP FIRST BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE ROLE FOLLOWED BY FILLING OUT LET. BUT I SEE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE WHO I KNOW ARE VERY WISE ON THIS ISSUE YOU'RE WELCOME TO ADDRESS JUST COME ON UP AND AND GET YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU CAN -- SUPPLIES BUT AFTERWARD -- IN THE INTEREST TO BE AN EXPEDITIOUS SUSAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I THANK YOU. MY NAME IS SUSAN BALDWIN AND NOT -- I AM A RETIRED PLANNER WHO WORKED ON HOUSING ISSUES THAT SANDBAG. FOR ABOUT OVER TWENTY FIVE COMMENTS TO MAKE -- I UNDERSTAND. AND BELIEVE THAT THEY TRULY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LOCK OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSING BEING BUILT. STATEWIDE NOT NOT JUST IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO -- I WORKED ON REPORTS THAT. COMPILED ALL THE DATA FROM THE CITY'S -- TO SHOW HOW MANY UNITS ARE HOW MANY BUILDING PERMITS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS TOO IS THAT THE THE INFORMATION ABOUT MODERATE INCOME. MODERATE INCOME HOUSING ISN'T TO WELL DEFINED. AND SO I THINK. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO PROVIDE CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS MODERATE INCOME SCENE. AND WHAT ARE AFFORDABLE RENTS AND PRICES FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO AFFORD. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OF SOME REASON HEARINGS -- AT THE COUNTY WHEN DEVELOPERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE BUILDING FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HOMES. AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT THOSE ARE FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND THAT. JUST ISN'T TRUE A MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AT THE UPPER END FOUR FOUR PERSON FAMILY IS -- NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A FAMILY MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY CAN AFFORD ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. WHAT MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IS AND WHO CAN AFFORD IT? AND MY OTHER -- POINT IS THAT WHEN MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IS PROVIDED AND I I'M GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I THINK IT HAS TO BE. DELIVERED IT HAS TO BE SUBSIDIZED IN SOME WAY OR IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PROVIDED. AND I THINK THAT -- THERE NEED TO BE DEED RESTRICTIONS TO ENSURE LONG TERM IN AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE WITHOUT THOSE DEED RESTRICTIONS. THOSE UNITS WILL NOT STAY MODERATE INCOME [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUSAN EVEN AS ONE OF JUST THE COMMITTEE. HELLO THIS IS RESTRAINING HIMSELF AS BEST HE CAN.
