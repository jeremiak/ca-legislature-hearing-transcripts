THE PROBABILITY OF LONG TERM OPIOID USE INCREASES MOST SHARPLY IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THERAPY ESPECIALLY AFTER FIVE DAYS. BY JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION WITH SOME TYPE OF LIMIT GUIDANCE OR REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OPIOID PRESCRIBING. AS A RESULT THEY HAVE SECRET SEEN A DECREASE IN ABUSE. MEANWHILE IN OUR STATE THERE ARE COUNTIES WHERE PRESCRIPTION RATES AND ABUSE ARE RISING DAILY.
