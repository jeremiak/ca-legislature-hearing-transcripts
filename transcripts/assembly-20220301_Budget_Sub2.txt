OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S STATE COMMISSION. GOOD CHAIR MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M SICK PRIMARY DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS WITH THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING- I'VE TO BEGIN MY REMARKS BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR TO THE POINT THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST RAISED THE LARGEST EXPANSION OF THE PELL GRANT ACCESS SINCE THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WAS CREATED- AND I HAVE TO EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION YOU. YES SENATE GOVERNOR AND PARTICULAR OUR LEGISLATIVE. YEAH YOU WILL SURE MCCARTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND HER COLLEAGUE SENATOR LEYVA TREMENDOUS FIRST THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL CRITICAL GAPS IN OUR CAL GRANT SYSTEM- AND HOW IT SERVING TODAY'S STUDENT. YOUR GENDER MATERIAL STEVEN BUT GREAT JOB AT SPEAKING ABOUT THE REMAINING GAPS IN ACCESS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATING THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS CURRENT APPROACH TO STATE FINANCIAL AID. WE KNOW THAT OFTEN OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS ALSO LACKED THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THEIR EXPENSES OUTSIDE OF TUITION LIKE HOUSING FOOD TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION BOOKS AND OTHER SUPPLIES. THIS IS YOUR AID COMMISSION BELIEVE THE STEP IS IN ACT TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION BY REMOVING THOSE REMAINING BARRIERS TO STUDENT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AND IT'S GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM FROM LAST YEAR'S MASSIVE EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO CONGREGATE AT WHICH ALL SHARES MORE DATA ON IN JUST A MOMENT. WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO REMOVE SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS GROUP THAT BUDGET ACT CHANGE LAST YEAR. THERE ARE STILL OTHER BARRIERS BASED ON. WHEN A STUDENT ENTERS A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AS A FRESHMAN. OR HOW THEY TRANSFER TO ANOTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE A TRANSCRIPT OR GPA DATA WILL ALSO KEEP OUT MANY OF OUR ADULT LEARNERS FROM ACCESSING CALTRAIN EIGHT WHO WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY BASED ON THEIR INCOME STATUS. COMMENTS ARE RATIONING MECHANISM FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID THAT TO SUPPORT FOR DISPROPORTIONATELY EXCLUDE OUR ADULT AND RETURNING LEARNERS DESPITE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROBABLY SERVING THE TOP 1100% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. HOW GRANT ALSO REALLY RIGHT A MAJOR RATHER THAN A STRAIGHT PATHWAY TO AFFORDABILITY. AS YOUR GENDER WOULD KNOW WE HAVE OVER A DIFFERENT CAL GRANT TODAY PROGRAM THAT AN ESTABLISHED TO HELP PROMOTE PATHWAYS TO PROJECT THAT THE SYSTEM CHALLENGING FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT MIGHT BE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. THIS TECHNIQUE COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED REMOVING THESE BARRIERS AND STREAMLINING THE PROGRAMS BY ESTABLISHING A CAL GRANT YOU FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND A TOP REPORTER FOR STUDENTS AT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. UNIVERSITIES WHILE THERE ARE STILL WE'RE STILL REFINING OR COST ESTIMATES BASED ON THE CHANGES TO FINANCIAL AID LAST YEAR AND DISCUSSION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS TO MAKE AROUND- STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND CATHOLIC GROWTH AS WE WOULD CALL HIM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. WE DO HAVE SOME INITIAL DATA ABOUT HOW MANY MORE STUDENTS WE COULD SERVE IF WE WERE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. AND JUST TO THINK WHAT YOU'RE A FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS THE FIRST ONE WE MOVED NEW. PROPOSED CAL GRANT U. N. FORCES DOWN THERE WOULD BE A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND STUDENT YOU BRING ANOTHER PROGRAM ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY THOSE FOR LATINO. AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. AND AS I NOTED WERE STILL REQUIRED THAT'S BECAUSE US TO. THE BALLPARK RANGE THAT COULD GIVE WITH. SOMEWHERE BUT TO HONOR AND FIFTY. TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN NYC ONGOING FUN. TO ESTABLISH CALGARY YOU AND THE CALIFORNIA FOR- USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL UTILIZE FOR THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT ANY STUDENT THAT'S ELIGIBLE FOR A PELL GRANT IS ALSO ELIGIBLE. FOR CAL GRANT YOU WERE CALTRANS FOR. AND I'M I'M HAPPY NOT A SHIRT SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA ABOUT LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION OF A FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. GO AHEAD TAKE. YES DEMOCRATIC. YES COULD YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. SO IT LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION OF EIGHT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS I'M PLEASED TO SHARE THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET TRAILER BILL IN LATE JULY WE WERE ABLE TO THAT IN NOVEMBER PROCESSES OUR FIRST ROUND OF NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT WARDS THIS YIELDED A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OFFERED AWARDS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. JUST IN NOVEMBER IN JANUARY BE PROCESS ANOTHER BATCH OF FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS AS MORE DATA IS SUBMITTED TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IN COMPLETING A STUDENT'S APPLICATION FOR AID THAT YIELDED ANOTHER FORTY THOUSAND OFFERS- OF AWARDS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THE DIRECT FROM YOU MAKE TO PASS YEARS BEFORE WE HAD THIS NEW. ACCESS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WOULD BE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OFFERED AN AWARD TO A COMPETITIVE CAL RANT PROGRAMS. THAT IT OFFERED ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THE COLLEGES WITH A CALTRANS WORKER. THIS REPRESENTS A NET INCREASE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOW GREAT STUDENTS AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I MISS IT BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE YOUR PARTNERS IN THE SENATE AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME SIGNING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. SO AGAIN HAVE TO EXPRESS HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE. AND OKAY WHAT WE ARE STILL PROCESSING- INCOMING INFORMATION FROM THE COLLEGES THAT CONFIRMS THAT THE STUDENTS BEEN PAID OUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ALL OF THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY GET PAID WE KNOW THIS THE THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS THAN WE'VE SERVED IN THE PAST. OF THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SUCH NOTED. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED AS AN WORLD BY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THEIR CAMPUS I'M. WHICH THIRD WORLD- UPDATES FROM OUR CAMP IS SO FAR ABOUT HOW MANY THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE.OUT FOR THAT CAMPUS LET. SUGGEST THAT FIFTY TWO. OF THE STATE. HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID THEIR WORK. THAT'S ABOUT THIRTY SAID PERCENT OF THE TOTAL CONFIRMED ANY ROLE STUDENTS. I SHOULD TRANSPORT FROM YEAR- ARE PRETTY- INDICATED. ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND. STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE AN AWARD THIS YEAR THREE THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. AT OUR QUESTIONS AND HAPPY TO SHARE MORE ABOUT SOME FACTORS THAT MIGHT BE AT PLAY. IN WOULD NOT SEEN ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BE PAPERWORK THAT- CORPORATE READY THANK ALL ALSO. MY COMMENT THERE TIME. QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW QUESTION AB BUT THE FIRST OF GO BACK TO THE OF FINANCE- THAT AS YOU NOTED- GABRIELA HE ARE YOU THERE. HI YES I'M HERE OKAY YES A TO SAY WORDS WE CAN QUIT KEEP TALKING SO WE CAN SEE. THE MORNING. THERE YOU ARE OKAY YES IT WOULD ARE HAVING WE DO A- YOUR COMMENTS AND AS NOTED EARLIER- LAST YEAR WAS- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR ONCE IN A. GENERATION BUDGET WAS. HAVING THE LARGEST INCREASE IN FINANCIAL AID. IN DECADES SINCE THIS TIME IT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND- AND WE NOTED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE OVER COMPANION BILL AND I KNOW. MR MEDINA AND I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR AND WE CAN MAKE TO THE MUTUAL CONCLUSION THAT. WE WERE SUPER EXCITED WAS THERE LAST YEAR THE GLASSES MORE THAN HALF FULL BUT THE GOVERNOR SAID SPECIFICALLY I'M GOING TO VETO THIS BILL. IN THIS ISSUE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED. IN THE- THE PROCESS AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS ON JANUARY TEN. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE A BUDGET. AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW THERE WAS SOME MONEY TO IMPLEMENT. LAST YEAR'S- ARRANGEMENTS SO WHY DO WE SEE ANY- WHAT WHAT WHY WHAT WHY WHY WHY WHY DO WE HAVE LACKING A NEW PROPOSAL FROM YOU ALL. AS FAR AS FURTHERING- FINANCIAL EXPANSION TO OUR CALVET PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR OF FROM THE PROMISED PERSPECTIVE THE RECENT EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM- REALLY HIGHLIGHTS OF BIGGEST INVESTMENT SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION- SO WE WHAT WE WILL LIKE TO ANALYZE. THE IMPACT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS BEFORE MAKING ADDITIONAL CHANGES. I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT AN EXPANSION OF AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE COCKER PROGRAM CAN BE CONSIDERED A COSTLY. THERE'S ALSO A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM IS AN ENTITLEMENT SO EVEN IF THERE'S A PROJECTED COSTS AND SYSTEM LEVEL SECONDS THE TYPICAL TATE SIGNIFICANTLY. LESS CABLES INCREASES OR DECREASES OVER TIME. AND FROM THE PROGRAM FROM THE PROPONENTS RESPECT EXPANDING AND ENTITLEMENT. PROGRAM IS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT RISKY AND A CONCERN US IT OF WHAT IF YOU LIMITS THAT BUT IT AFFECTS. AS WELL AS TO SEND SOMETHING LIABILITY THE IN GO INTO. OKAY SO YOU'RE THINKING OF THE SAN. WE HEAR YOU THIS IS A OF THE AT THE SAME. AND THIS SEPT CAN WE GO BACK TO- PER FOR THE HE A PRIME PERSON BERMAN BERMAN. FROM THE FRONT THE SENATE COMMISSION AND YOU OF COURSE WE THE PARTNER LAST YEAR AND IT'S- ARLA. CAN CAN YOU OUTLINE A WHAT PIECES THAT WE DID NOT COMPLETE FROM YEAR'S REFORM FOR. AND THEN WHAT THE ESTIMATED COST FOR COMPLETING THOSE. YES CHAIR MCCARTY HAPPY TO DO SO- THE REMAINING GAPS IN ELIGIBILITY AND ESSENTIALLY BARRIERS THAT PREVENT STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING A CAL GRANT THAT ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS THERE ARE A FEW WOULD BE THAT WE STILL NEED TO TAKE ON. WE STILL HAVE REQUIREMENTS FOR ARE ENTERING FRESHMEN STUDENTS AT FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS BASED ON WHEN THEY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND IN THE CASE OF STUDENTS TRANSFERRING TO THOSE UNIVERSITIES FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE GUARANTEED CALTRAIN ACCESS EVEN IF THEY'RE FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE IF THEY HAVE NOT FIRST RECEIVED A CAL GRANT BEFORE GOING TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY THEY'LL NEED TO BE- UNDER AGE TWENTY EIGHT TO GET THAT ENTITLEMENT. AND THEY STILL ALSO NEED TO BE UNDER AGE TWENTY EIGHT IN ORDER TO HAVE GUARANTEED- ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIBRATED FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE ACADEMICALLY ELIGIBLE IF THEY'RE TRANSFERRED TO A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY SO WE TOOK AWAY MUCH OF THE AGE CAP AS WE CALL IT ON CAL GRANT BUT WE DIDN'T FULLY ELIMINATE THAT. IN ORDER TO BE FULLY ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT IS YOU CAN APPLY FOR AN ENTITLEMENT- WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION WE ALSO HAVE THAT GPA AND TRANSCRIPT REQUIREMENT THAT I MENTIONED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHICH WE KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THOSE RETURNING ADULT LEARNERS WHO WERE WORKING SO HARD TO TRY. TO SERVE AND FIND NEW WAYS TO SERVE MORE AND- LAST YEAR IT'S BUT A MORE CHEN PER IT BECAME MORE CALM. BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT MEETING FOR THE DEEP FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS- THAT'S WHERE WE THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO STREAMLINE THESE PROGRAMS. REDUCE FROM EIGHT PROGRAMS TO AND THEN ALSO A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM. IT'S GOING TO COME AND IN THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION CYCLE THAT BEGINS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. STILL CALIFORNIA WANTS TO ROLL OUT ITS- MORE SIMPLIFIED STREAMLINED APPROACH TO FINANCIAL AID. PRINT CURRENTLY WITH THE NEW SIMPLIFIED FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT WILL START IN THAT APPLICATIONS LIKE ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS IS REALLY THE HERE WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE STEPS MAKE THOSE POLICY CHANGES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT READY TO GO IN A PROCESS STUDENTS. I THINK FIRST OF. OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. AND CHECK THE SECOND PARTY DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A BALLPARK ON. THE- ESTIMATE FOR. ACHIEVING THOSE. THOSE THAT OUTSTANDING GOALS. YES SORRY MR ONE SHARE SO- A NOTE PREVIOUS WE IN CAN YOU. WITH THE PART OF FINDING BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ANY COST ESTIMATES WE PRODUCE ISRAELI AIR TIGHT AND REFLECT ANY. METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD ADVISE US PARTICULARLY AROUND- PROJECTIONS FOR STUDENT INVOLVEMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON CASELOAD. HOW MANY CAL GRANT STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO ELIGIBLE IN THOSE YEARS THAT WE KNOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS CONCERNED WITH. I CAN GIVE YOU A BALLPARK THIS IS NOT A FINAL ESTIMATE AS WE ARE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT. WHAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS SHOULD BE BUT THE BALLPARK WOULD BE ON THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SIDE. PROBABLY ONGOING FUNDING. AND THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD NOTICE AS YOU EXPAND ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ELIGIBLE THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY POP WITH OUT OF THE CALVERT OFTEN BASED ON DOES NOT BARRIERS THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR ACCESS THE WORD THAT WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS PARENTS CURRENTLY THERE WOULD ALSO BE A NEED FOR AN APPROPRIATION TO KEEP THAT PROGRAM HOLE SO THAT AS WE SERVE MORE STUDENTS PARENTS WE CANNOT KEEP THAT SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR IMPORTANT PLACE AND THAT NUMBER I BELIEVE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON GOING TO KEEP THIS DEPARTMENT PURPLE. OKAY THANK YOU. TO OPT OUT. CERTAINLY COME BACK. THIS ISSUE- LATER IN THE YEAR. MR MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO I ATE HERE IN THE DISCUSSION I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY IT'S NOT ONLY A BUDGET ISSUE MY CORRECT IN THAT- IN ORDER TO REMOVE SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT YOU ADDRESS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE GPA AND TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. WE WOULD NEED LEGISLATION IS ACT. IN ORDER IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS SO IT CANNOT ALL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE BUDGET. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I THINK- WE HAVE THIS CHALLENGE WITH CAL GRANT PROGRAMS CHANGES WHERE WE KNOW IT IS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE BUT ALSO ONE THAT TAKES FUNDING- WE WERE VERY PLEASED OF COURSE THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP TO FEET. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX LAST YEAR CLEAR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL- THAT BEING SAID WE THINK THAT THE WAY WE CAN UNDERTAKE THESE CHANGES IN THIS YEAR IS TO TAKE THE APPROACH WE DID WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. LAST YEAR AND FUND THOSE CHANGES AND THEN UTILIZE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MAKE A POLICY CHANGES WE OF COURSE HAVE OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE AS WELL UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TODAY WE CAN GO THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS WITH AFTER FULL DISK. ABOUT WHAT THE CALIFORNIA YEAH AND I AGREE VERY MUCH THAT THE- SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESSES IS ALSO. VERY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER. NAVIGATE AND APPLY- UNDER ON THE MATTER OF THE PROGRAM WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING- AND THAT'S ANOTHER GOAL I BELIEVE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS YEAR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- REFLECTS THE CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF- IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF. WE DIDN'T MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO OUR STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES DIFFERENT CHANGES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I THINK THE KEY ISSUE THERE IS REALLY A MISSED OPPORTUNITY THAT SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS NEW FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT WILL HAVE A STREAMLINED AND SIMPLIFIED APPS THAT- TOWARD THE GOAL OF THEN PROVIDING A LOOK UP TABLE WE'RE A FAMILY COULD SIMPLY LOOK UP BASED ON THEIR HOUSEHOLD STATUS. AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD SIZE BUT THE INCOME CEILING IS TO GET SOME KIND OF HELP GRANT AWARD. WE WILL HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO UTILIZE TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID- YOU'RE PROPOSING FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND WITH YOUR SUPPORT. IS TO MOVE TOWARD A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN USE THAT SAME LOOK UP TABLE IF IT'S CALLED SO THAT IS STUDENT AND- MEMBER FAMILY CAN LOOK AT THAT TABLE FIND THAT INCOME CEILING AND UNDERSTAND THEIR ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE. FINANCIAL AID THROUGH THE PELL GRANT AND THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- IF WE WERE TO NOT MAKE THOSE CHANGES THIS YEAR- BUT WE WERE TO DO SO AT A LATER YEAR WE WOULD HAVE A FEW CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF MAJOR CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT. MIGHT BE BETTER TAKEN COMPREHENSIVELY AND MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER RATHER THAN PUTTING FORWARD A NEW FEDERAL SYSTEM IN YOUR ONE AND YOUR STATE SYSTEM IN YOUR TO WORK. PRETTY. IT ABOUT HOW WE COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS FAMILIES ELEGY. FOR SO THE- THEREFORE AT WOULD I TAKE THERE IS. AS OF VERGE. TO THIS DONE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THERE IS YES. THANK YOU MISTER DONNA. YES SIR MY QUESTION IS OF BASIC- IN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW YOU MAY DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH EACH SEGMENT COLLECTS EACH YEAR IN TUITION MEANING- CSU AND UC OLIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OUT OF IT BECAUSE THEIR TUITIONS FREE BUT DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COLLECTED IN STUDENT FEES OR WHAT WE'LL CALL TUITION. FOR OUR PURPOSES TODAY. IN TOTAL. MR DOWNS JAX WEALTH OVER FINANCE- I DO KNOW THAT INFORMATION BUT I DON'T HAVE IT HANDY I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STEPHENS IN THE LONG. THANK YOU YEAH I WOULD. YOU TO HAVE A BUT I'M JUST LOOKING AT THIS EXERCISE MORTGAGE IN HERE. AND I'LL AT A YOUNG AGE NOT PEE IN THE WIND. AND I WONDER IF WE'RE DOING THAT WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE COLLEGE FREE. I MEAN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LOGISTICS INFRASTRUCTURE. STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THESE BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAMS. TO BUY DOWN THE TUITION AND TO ME IT'S A NO BRAINER. TO JUST TAKE SOME OF THIS MONEY. AND MAKE THE TUITION NONEXISTENT I KNOW LEGALLY I THINK WE DON'T CHARGE THEM TUITION WE CHARGING FEES BECAUSE OF THAT THE MASTER PLAN WHICH I BELIEVE CALLED FOR THESE SEGMENTS TO BE FREE NOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY AND LARGE FOR A HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT GOES THEIR FIRST YEAR RIGHT FREE COLLEGE PROMISE OF WHICH WE DID MR MCCARTY LED THE EFFORT ON THAT. BUT TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE HAD TO REBOOT THIS WHOLE EFFORT AND RETHINK WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOOD PEOPLE WORKING HARD TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SITTING OFFICES RIGHT NOW PROBABLY DEALING WITH PAPERWORK CENTER TRYING TO GET KIDS JUST SAY TO. SOURCES WOULD BE BETTER AND JUST MAKING THIS EFFORT FREE. THAT'S MY EDITORIAL STRUCTURE. OKAY I. OTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT I WILL NOTE- MISTER DONALD THIS THAT YOUR OVERARCHING THING IS 100% TRUE IS THAT YOU TAKE SOMEBODY WITH A PHD TO FIGURE OUT ALL THESE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY MAKE IT EASIER THAT'S HALF WE DID LAST YEAR. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT UC AND CSU ON THE ROAD IN FRONT OF US LIKE ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OR SO. DON'T PAY ANY FEES AT ALL PEENE. TUITION SO IT'S REALLY THE NON TUITION COSTS WHY STUDENTS WE HEAR FROM OUR STUDENTS LATER IN THE DAY THAT PUTS THEM. IN AND FINANCIAL PERIL IS A SO MUCH DAD IT'S ALL THE OTHER COSTS OF- YEAH THAT'S A WE'RE TRYING TO GET A WE HAVE A BALANCING ACT SO. ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR CHARITY I THINK STUDENTS AREN'T AFRAID TO WORK I HAVE A- STUDENT LIVING IN MY HOUSE MY DAUGHTER THAT GOES TO WORK I WORKED I DROVE A TOW TRUCK FOUR DAYS A WEEK FIFTEEN HOUR SHIFTS. BUILDS CHARACTER SO AGAIN I THINK THE STARTING POINT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON A B. TUITION FREE YEAH. WELL THAT THE WERE A LOT OF YOU HAVE TO GATHER I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE ARE BILL THAT MR MEDINA HIGHER OFFERING WITH LEYVA. IT'S IT IF THE FORMULA FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE IS STUDENTS AFTER THIS. YOU TAKE YOUR FIND YOUR PARENTS FINANCIAL SITUATION BASED UPON HOW MUCH INCOME YOU HAVE TO PUT ON THE TABLE FRANCE LATE. THE SUIT HAS TO WORK FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK. SO THAT'S PART OF OUR OF OUR GOAL OUR CONTACT IS THAT YES WE THINK THAT THERE IS A- OPPORTUNITY AN OBLIGATION FOR. STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE SO. I OCCURRED YOUR PER. WITH OUR BILL I KNOW THERE'S A BUT IT CAN TO HIRE BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE EXACT SAME ISSUES ON ON OUR END AND AGAIN IT'S OKAY TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS AS WELL. YEP IT IS OKAY TO DO THAT WELL I DON'T KNOW IT TOO I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT HERE BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. CEMEX HIS IS COMING UP. AND THAT WAS A BIG PIECE TO MAKE SURELY HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NOT ONLY FOR TUITION BUT PROVIDE SOME- NON TUITION SUPPORT FOR. FOR AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES SO WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN. IN PROCEEDS ISSUE NUMBER TWO- THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE BASICALLY IT'S A IT'S A REBOOT FROM WHAT WE- CREATED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST OVER. ELIGIBILITY ASSERT THAT. I WEALTHY IN IN TODAY'S CALIFORNIA WITH ALL THE OTHER COSTS SUCH AS HOUSING SO. WE ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEN. STUDENT COMMISSION PLEASE PROCEED. THE MONEY CHAIR COMMITTEE MAY. OF THE CALL. BUDGET INCLUDES ONE THIRTY MILLION ON. GENDER FUND. TO SUPPORT THE REVISED MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM ENACTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AT. WHICH TAKES EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT EXPANDED THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. LIVE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS NEARLY ELIGIBLE. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY L. A. L. THANK YOU. EIGHTY SEVEN DESCRIBE THE THICKNESS REVAMPS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT'S PLAN. FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. JUST A MINUTE CRIED WE'RE AMOUNTS WILL BE HELPED UNDER THIS WEEKEND PROGRAM. THE THING WHAT AMOUNTS SOLELY ON TUITION TRY. BUT WHAT ABOUT WILL BECOME BASED ON THE TOLL COST OF. TO OPPOSE THAT INVOLVES A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT. YOU NEED WILL COME WHAT REMAINING COSTA THE STUDENT CALIFORNIA. CONTRA BECAUSE TIME WORK COULD BE DEFENDED BY. MOST OF COUNTRY SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS HOUSEHOLD INCOME A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR OR MORE. YOU NEED ME WILL DETERMINE WHAT. ABOUT STUDENTS BECAUSE COME. FIFTY THE ANNUAL FUNDING INCLUDING THE FACT. AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEVEL SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TWO ON. IT MADE IT THAT WOULD 20% OF EACH FROM CALL. YOU'LL HEAR FROM AID COMMISSION ABOUT PROGRESS THEY MAY IN MY THIS FOR. I DID THE FLY IN ADVANCE FOR YOU BY ISSUE THE IS. IN YOUR AGENDA. IT NOT THAT EACH STUDENTS AWAY AMOUNT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT. BETWEEN THE STUDENT COMMISSION CAMPUS AID OFFICE AS- A RESULT THERE'S AN- ANY RIGHT NOW AS TO WHEN TO WORK WILL BE FOR STUDENT. AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER WILL HAVE THAT AND IN HAND THE MIDDLE SCHOLARSHIP WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE COMES TIME TO MAKE IN THE THAT. FOR THE. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY. THANK YOU THE HAPPY TO TAKE A CLASS. FOR THE TEN YEAR THANK YOU- THAT PART. OF POST A COMMISSION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SO AS OUR OUR CALL AT LA NOTED ALL PROVIDER YOU UP YOUR ON THE YOU NEED COMMISSION ROGRESS IN MOVING FORWARD AN EMPLOYEE THIS NEW AND SICK REVISE THE PRODUCT TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL BROKE. DO COMMISSION HAD TO CONVENE THE GROUP WITH OUR PARTNER AT THE SEE IN THE CSU. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN WORK TO THE BIGGER OF THE- WE'VE ALSO- BEEN WORK WITH THE- ANALYST. YOU SEE AN CSU TO HELP AND REFINE COST ESTIMATE FOR FULL. OF THE PROBE. USING STUDENT LEVEL- AT THIS CAN AN ADDITIONAL DATA THE YOU SEE IN FEES PROVIDE ABOUT THEIR- EIGHT. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA UPDATED COSTA. THE THAT TOTAL FUNDING FOR HIM TO. WOULD APPROXIMATELY TWO PER SIX BILL DOLLARS FUNDING. AND AT THIS UPCOMING YEAR WE WILL SERVE CLEARANCE DOLLARS STUDENTS. THIS PROGRAM. INCLUDING THIS WE TRYING TO IN BASED AND TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MAY FUNDING AND THE AVERAGE OF WORK WITH LIKE JUST YOU ACROSS A RANGE INCOME PILOTS AND WE SHARED THAT DATA WITH COMEDIAN WELL. GIVEN THE LAST DOLLAR TEACHER THIS PRO. AS WELL AS THE THE BUT APPROPRIATE TO THE CLASS CAN ONLY ESTIMATE THE AWARD FOR EACH STUDENT RECIPIENT. ONCE WE KNOW SEVERAL POINTS. FIRST THE TOTAL OF IT WILL. BASED ON THE NUMBER. STUDENTS AND THE TOTAL TO PROTECT. NEXT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING A PER. TOWARDS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. AND THEN THIRD AND PERHAPS MOST CHALLENGING. ALL OTHER FORMS OF EIGHTY EACH STUDENT WILL RECEIVE INCLUDING THAT STUDENTS INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT AWARDS THAT COME FROM THE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. AT WHICH TURN ROLLED. MR NATE CAN FINALLY THAT CALL ESTIMATE WAIT TO AND I JUST KNOW. AND WE SAW THE PER FUNDING AMOUNT FOR THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YOU'RE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PRESENTED ON JANUARY. RIGHT NOW HELP STUDENTS ARE STILL APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID- THROUGH MARCH SECOND THE PRIORITY DEADLINE FOR CALIFORNIA TITLE MATCH TOMORROW- BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT AN EXTENSION OF THAT DEADLINE UNTIL PEOPLE FIRST. IT'S VERY LIKELY GOOD APPEALS FROM INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE DISTRICTS BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION. EVEN THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON APPLICATION SUPPORT AGENT AND DECREASED APPLICATION RIGHT. SEE IF YOU WHEN YOU SEE CAN DATA TO THIS TO MAKE AADHAR STAFF THAT THEY WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO SHARE INSTITUTIONAL DATA ONCE THEY HAVE PASSED THEIR ADMISSIONS DEADLINE AND UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACT OF ENROLLMENT DECISIONS. ON INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT AWARDS. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THAT DATA IN JULY. AT WHICH POINT WE COULD DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AWARDS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THIS MEANS THAT THE STUDENT COMMISSION AND ARE. UNIVERSITY PARK MAY BE ABLE TO. THE ABOUT THEIR LAST ALLEGED FOR MIDDLE CLASS. AWARD DURING THIS FOR. WE WOULD NOT TO DEAL AVAILABLE TO A PRECISE AWARD AMOUNT FOR EACH OF THOSE UNIVERSITY. UNTIL THE STOCK. AND THIS IS TRUE NOT ONLY FOR THIS FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION. REALLY WILL BE TRUE OF ANY FUTURE HERE UNTIL. A DIFFERENT MECHANISM FOR DIFFERENT TIMELINE AND IN PLACE. FOR WHEN YOU SEE IF THE ISSUE CAMPUSES COULD SHARE THAT MOMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL A DATA. WITH THIS TO MAKE. OKAY AND CAN YOU GO OVER WHAT THE- UPPER INCOME LIMITS ARE NOW FOR. THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS. YES SURE I BELIEVE THAT THE UPPER INCOME LIMIT FOR THIS YEAR IS A HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. STATURE AND SO THIS- THIS THIS REALLY SETS US UP IN THE IN THE FUTURE TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NOT JUST FOR TUITION BUT ALSO. NON TUITION COSTS. SO WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO. COORDINATE BETWEEN THIS AND OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS TO MAKE IT SEAMLESS WE DON'T NEED THAT PHD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL. THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND ONE WE DIDN'T THINKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT AS YOU'D IMAGINE- RIGHT NOW ALL- AS YOU NOTED THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND ELIGIBILITY CEILING WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT. GRAHAM FOR A FAMILY OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS INCOME CEILING ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. SO THIS MEANS THAT- REALLY MOST DO YOU SEE AND CSU STUDENTS FOR SPEAKING TO. WHAT ALSO. BE RECEIVING A CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WORK ON THEIR- THE PIECE THAT GETS HERE IS THAT THERE WILL STILL BE STUDENTS MORE LOWER INCOME OR MIDDLE INCOME. AND FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BASED ON THOSE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN OUR PRIOR AGENDA ITEM. SO THIS REALLY CREATED SOME COMPLEXITY PRESS AT THE STATE MADE COMMISSION IN COMMUNICATING THE AID THAT THE STUDENT WOULD RECEIVE UNDER BOTH PROGRAMS. BECAUSE YOU HELP STUDENTS WITH ACADEMIC INCOME PROFILES BUT BASED ON THOSE NON FINANCIAL- BARRIERS STUDENTS MADE JUST GETTING THEM IN CLASS. WORK AND NOT ALSO THE CALTRAIN WORK THAT WOULD HELP COVER THEIR TUITION. WE BELIEVE IT PUBLIC RECORD WOULD HELP SIMPLIFY THE MESSAGE THAT WE CAN SEND TO LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS SO THAT WE CAN INFORM THEM THAT THEY'LL BE GETTING GUARANTEED COOL TUITION COVERAGE. THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM CAN HELP FURTHER OFFSET THEIR NON. TUITION EXPENSES. AND THEN IT MUCH WOULD WE- WOULD WE FOR. FULL BLACK OF BETTER TERM DEBT FREE COLLEGE GRANTS TO ENABLE. CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS TO WORK. FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT TO HAVE THE- EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION BASED UPON. IS THERE AN ISSUE WITH MY- NUMBER OF PEOPLE- I'M SORRY IF. THAT'S OKAY EIGHT HOW MUCH WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE DEBT FREE COLLEGE GRANTS TO BASED UPON THIS SCENARIO WHERE STUDENTS WORK FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK YOU HAVE THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION BASED UPON YOU KNOW THEIR FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL. AND YOU HAVE THE EXISTING FINANCIAL AID AWARDS HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED. TO PROVIDE AT A DEBT FREE COLLEGE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FULLY THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AS IT WAS REVISED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT WITH THAT REMARK IN MIND GERMAN CURTI THE COST THAT WE ARE PROJECTED WITH TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. ABOUT THE PRIOR APPROPRIATION. AND SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH MINE I THOUGHT WOULD PROVIDE LAST YEAR WHICH IS. JUST NORTH OF A BILLION. I I'M TRYING TO. THINK OF THE MAP HERE IT'S TWO POINT SIX BILLION FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION YOU HAVE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY TWO. MILLION PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT MEASURE THAT'S APPLES TO APPLES BECAUSE THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR IS JUST. FOR THIS YEAR'S I THINK THERE'S COMMITTED TO ANY OTHER BASED UPON THE A GROUP THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT LAST YEAR. HOW MUCH MORE WOULD BE INCLUDED I DON'T THINK IT'S TWO BILLION. CAN YOU GET BACK TO US WITH THAT WITH THAT WITH THOSE NUMBERS. I'M HAPPY TO DO SO YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU SLIMMER REST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION PROVIDED I HAVE ONE CONCERN AND VALUES THAT OFTENTIMES. WELL REALLY THE STUDENTS THAT WERE MOST LOOKING AT OUR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE MOST DISADVANTAGED THE ONES OF THE HARDEST TIME PAYING FOR THEIR TUITION. IF WE HAVE CAL GRANT WITH ITS ISSUES WE NOW HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP THE BASICALLY SUPPLEMENTS BUT IF OUR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS DON'T GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING UNDER CAL GRANT BECAUSE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT YOU'VE NOTED. THEY ARE EVEN MORE DISADVANTAGED. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION THE TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT WE CAN DO AS THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS EVEN IF IT'S TEMPORARY WHILE WE LOOK TO CORRECT IT'S COMPLETELY. ASSEMBLY MAJORITY LEADER THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT IN THIS DISCUSSION AND WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION BUT IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS- IT DOES WORK FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT CLEAR MESSAGE TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT IF YOU'RE BELOW THIS DEFINED INCOME THRESHOLD. WE'RE GOING TO COVER YOUR TUITION AND THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMMING INSTITUTIONAL AID WILL HELP FURTHER OFF THAT ALL OF THOSE OTHER NON TUITION COSTS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR PRIOR AGENDA ITEM WE THINK THAT. IN A STATEMENT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE TO LOWER. STUDENTS AND THEY HAVE. WHO CURRENT RIGHT NOW DON'T HAVE THAT GUARANTEED. ACCESS SITUATION COVERAGE TO BE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS IT WOULD ONLY SEE A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR WORK BE COVERED TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP FOR. SO SHORT OF IT% IF I MOVED THROUGH THE CHAIR. SO SHORT OF JUST TELLING THEM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET EVERYTHING. MY SPECIFIC QUESTION IS WHAT CAN WE DO. IT I THINK IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISSERVICE IF WE ARE PUTTING SO MUCH MONEY INTO MIDDLE. CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. WHICH IS IT'S LAUDABLE. BUT IF WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE STUDENTS WHO NEED IT THE MOST. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN CARE OF SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I THINK IT'S A DISSERVICE TO THE ONES WHO DEPEND ON US MOST TO HELP THEM PAY FOR THIS TUITION AND RELATED EXPENSES. SO SHORT OF JUST TELLING THEM YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED- MAYBE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT LATER WHAT CAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE DO NOW TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS IS TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE WE START PUTTING IN SO MUCH MONEY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. YEAH AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHARED- THAT SENTIMENT AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE MAKING PATHWAYS AFFORDABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS WERE NOT LEAVING BEHIND THIS POPULATION THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO MAJORITY LEADER. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY A QUESTION FOR WHERE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR- WISHED YOU- DEDICATE FUNDS AND HOW YOU WANT TO BUILD ON THE INVESTMENT THAT WERE AGREED UPON LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT SID BELABOR THE POINT WHERE WE HAD THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION ARE ARE SO I'M INVESTED IN THE CONCEPT OF CAL GRANT REPORT. IT REMOVES THOSE REMAINING BARRIERS TO KEEP OUT LOGIN STUDENTS- THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS YOU CAN CONSIDER THAT WOULD BE. HELPFUL LESS DIRECTED AND LYFT SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES IN THAT WOULDN'T REALLY PROVIDE. GUARANTEED ACCESS TO STUDENTS IN THE OUT YEARS OR CREATE THAT KIND OF CLEAR COHESIVE SYSTEM THAT WE REALLY WANT TO COMMUNICATE FOR STUDENTS. SO FINALLY IF I MAY CHAIR. SO BEFORE WE PUT THE ONE. DOLLARS IN THE CLASS. IT SOUNDS LIKE IN RESPONSE TO. TERROR MCCARTY'S QUESTION IT WAS 200-523-0050 MILLION. NO ONE ON GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUES IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR THE MOST. DISADVANTAGE THE MOST OF IT YOU NEED OF ASSISTANCE. IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT AND I WOULD JUST NOTE ALSO THAT ANY DOLLARS YOU PUT INTO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT GO OUT TO YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU STUDENTS I'VE TOLERATE AWARDS FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT ACTUALLY BUYS DOWN YOUR CALL. ON THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM BECAUSE THEN THERE'S THAT MUCH LESS OF A GAP IN UNMET FINANCIAL NEED THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WOULD BE COVERING SO IN A WAY YOU'RE PREPAYING TOWARDS MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IMPLEMENTATION WELL YOU ARE ALSO DIRECTING RESOURCES TO THOSE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS WERE SO OFTEN KEPT OUT AND. THOSE ELIGIBILITY BITTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK THE PICTURE HERE IS AS WE KNOW. IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN THE BUDGET AFTER THE MAY REVISED REVENUE NUMBERS COME OUT. AND WE GET OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALLOCATIONS FOR EACH SUB COMMITTEE IN THE SOMETHING SOMETHING FOR A PRIORITY SO LET'S SAY WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I THINK WE SEE THAT. ASK THIS TO NAY COMMISSION LEADERS AS WHAT HOW DO WE FOCUS ON OUR BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK EVEN THOUGH IT'S TWO BILLION TO GET OUR DREAM SYSTEM. IF WE GET A QUARTER OF THAT THIS YEAR AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HELP THAT THE STUDENTS THE NEEDIEST STUDENTS LIKE. THIS REYES SAID WHO SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT STUDENTS WHO. GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL ON TIME HAVE IT TOGETHER THEY FIGURE IT OUT AND THEY HAVE PARENTS AND FAMILIES FIGURED OUT. IT'S A STUDENTS WHO WE WANT TO HELP THE MOST TO. GO BACK TO SCHOOL FIVE YEARS LATER. WE'RE IN THE WORK FORCE SO THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO GET COLLEGE DEGREES AND- AND TO THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE. FAILING AND SELL. THESE LOOPHOLES IN THAT WE WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDE PEOPLE. THOSE ARE THE ONES I THINK ARE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE SHOULD TACKLE- TACKLE FIRST- MR ADAN. YES THANK YOU AND PERSONA ZERO FREE THE FACT WE HAVE. THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. TO ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING DYNAMICS I FACES LEGISLATURE. IS THAT IT DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE CLASS THIS IS WHY MY PARTY LOSES BECAUSE WE DO NOT PAY. ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE CLASS- SO AGAIN- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE THING- MANY THAT ACTUALLY A FEW ACTUALLY THAT- PAYS ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE L. A. M. AT THE HIGH END OF THE INCOME AND ASSET MAXIMUM IS ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND. FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IS THERE A THRESHOLD ON THE LOWER END. TO ACCESS THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. YEAH I'M SORRY HE DOES START TO QUESTION AND THEN IF MY COLLEAGUES ARE FINANCE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I THINK THEY MAY WISH THAT ON AS WELL. UNDER CURRENT VERSION OF THE PROGRAM THAT THIS UNIVERSE OF THE HEALTHCARE BEIJING NOT RECEIVING THE SCHOLARSHIP HOWEVER UNDER THE PROVIDE PROGRAM WILL TAKE IN TWENTY TWO TO THREE STUDENTS RECEIVE BOTH. HELPING TO CLASS SCHOLARSHIP RIGHT AND SO THERE IS NO FOR RECEIVING A MIDDLE CLASS PROGRAMMING DEVICE VERSION OF THE PROGRAM AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS RECEIVED LITTLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THAT HOW CAN AFFORD. OKAY MY CONCERN. WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE MONEY FOR MIDDLE CLASS NON AND THAT IT NOT BE. YOU KNOW A EVERYBODY CAN ACCESS ACCESS TO THAT'S NOT. JUST FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE MEDICAL. FOUR OR IN EFFECT WATERING IT DOWN. AND IN THE PAST THERE TO- SO. JUST SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT I WANT TO HELP LOWER INCOME PEOPLE WERE DOING A LOT OF THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA WORKS THERE'S NOTHING MORE. CALIFORNIAN THAN THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- WE WANT. TO SUPPORT THE MIDDLE CLASS AS WELL WHO OFTEN DOES NOT SUPPORT FEEL SUPPORTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU. SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM WE WILL HOLD THE ISSUE OPEN AND PROCEED WITH THE ISSUE. NUMBER. THREE WHICH ARE VARIOUS STATE AID CAN MENTION BUDGET PROPOSALS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND AND FIVE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE NEW PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AND TO ADDRESS THE STAFFING NEEDS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME.

FOR A NEW POSITION. KENSHIN'S EVEN TO STUDENT AID COMMISSION FINE AID PROGRAMS LOOK AT THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK THE REASON THING STAFFING AT THE STUDENT COMMISSION AND WE RECOMMEND A PER BECAUSE PROPOSED. TO YOU NEED COMMISSION COUNSEL REQUEST. TWENTY TWO PER IN A- TO THE FACT THAT SHINSUKE IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO WITH AND THE FURNACE TO. DIFFERENCE THE WARREN. INSURANCE QUALIFICATION OF PROGRAMMING. WITHIN THE. THE CUSTOMER. THE NEW REQUIREMENT FOR SCHOOL TO VERIFY THE SCHOOL ARE UP IN APPLE. LIKELY WILL TO FOR THE CASH COLLEGE FIND AID OR PROPOSED ONE TIME. YOU KNOW THE APPLICATION IN ONGOING IN NATURE SO IF YEARS PLEDGES MAY ALSO TO CONVEY THOUGHT FUNDING FOR RECALL. YOUR STUDENTS PROTESTING THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER REDIRECT EXPENDED FUNDS TO THE DREAM LOAN PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY HIS IN CSU. HOSTING FRIEDMAN WORD OF MOUTH IS EVERY WAY TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY UNDER SUBSCRIBED. THE CURRENT LAW OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDING LEVEL IS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AS OF LAST FALL ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS PROTEST. ONE OF THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS YOU NEED QUESTIONS I DON'T FOR THE LUCRATIVE RATE IS THAT STUDENTS. ABLE TO FIND BETTER PAYING WORK OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. I'M THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BY PROVIDING THE EQUIVALENT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE FOR STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE A LOT OF TO COMPENSATE STUDENTS RIGHT IT'S MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY COULD RECEIVE. THROUGH THESE OTHER WORK OPPORTUNITIES. WE RECOMMENDED THE GOVERNOR'S BECAUSE INCREASE WORD ON HOW BACK. TO THE MARKET OF THAT WILL TO PART TIME TO GET A. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LANGUAGE PART TIME STUDENT WOULD COME THE THING THIRTY HOURS RECEIVED OF. FOR MEETING THE REST ROLLED TIME WE BE RECEIVE A COUPLE AS DOLLARS A FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR. WE DON'T FEEL STRONG RATIONALE FOR COMPANY PART CAN AT A LOW HOURLY RATE SO RECOMMEND REMOVING THE- OF AWARDS. PART FINALLY BECAUSE THE READER OF ON FUNDS TO DREAMLAND.

SENATE COMMISSION. HE CAN IS AT ALL ALL THE WITH THE- BUT PROPOSAL AROUND FOR FACT THAT. NEEDS AND ALL BEGIN BY NOTE THAT THE CAN VERY FOR THE PURPOSE STAFF AUTHORITY IN DID YOU- FUNDING THAT PROVIDED IN THE COMING PROPOSED BUDGET HOWEVER AS THE LEGISLATIVE AND ALL NOTED THAT WE WERE. I OF THE FULL TWENTY SEVEN POSITION- BEEN REQUESTED BY THE STUDENT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED WITH FOUR DOLLARS AND GOING. ITS REQUEST FOR INVESTMENT INTEREST HAVE COME UP AS WERE. OF YEAR'S ACTS. AND OTHER POLICY MAY LAST YEAR. THERE'S BEEN HIGH SCHOOL. AID REQUIREMENT WITH ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE COME ONLINE THIS UP YEAR- WHAT WILL MEAN THAT THERE'S NOT ONLY MORE STUDENTS APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID- BUT THERE ALSO BE MORE QUESTIONS COMING FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND MORE. FOR OUR ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT ARE TRYING TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS APPLY. WE ALL KNOW AS WE SPOKE ABOUT HER AND- TO HEARING. THE NATIONAL CALIBER AT RECIPIENTS FOR DO YOU NEED. TO AND SERVE UNDER THE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENTITLEMENT. LAST YEAR TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ADOPTED A CO WORK BASED TUITION SYSTEM THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO IMPLEMENT AND PROCESS AND MAKE TECHNICAL CHANGES TO OUR WORKING SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDING A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CALTRAIN AWARD TO STUDENTS BASED ON THE YEAR WHICH STANDS. WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE LARGER AND MORE COMPLEX MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM THAT WE'RE GOING TO START IMPLEMENTING THIS YEAR. AND FINALLY- I ALREADY MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE FORTHCOMING CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL APPLICATION SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL AID AND WHILE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES IT DOES REQUIRE TECHNICAL CHANGES ON OUR PART AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. TO ALIGN OUR WORK SYSTEM WITH THE NEW DATA WILL BE RECEIVING TO THE FEDERAL EIGHT APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS TO BE A CORRESPONDING CHANGES TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION NOTED THE STUDENT COMMISSION SAW SIXTY. AND IN THE AMOUNT OF THE LISTED FUNDS. THERE WERE MANY BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET YEAR. AND THE LEVEL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET CARE FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. LAST YEAR ALONE THERE IS AN INCREASE IN OVERALL ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT IF YOU NEED COMMISSION IS MANAGING. WHAT THE COMES SIGNIFICANT NOT ONLY OUR PROGRAM STAFF BUT ALSO ADMINISTRATIVE I. AND FINANCIAL STAFF. THAT HELPED OVERSEE OUR CONTRACTING PROGRAM BUDGET STUDENT APPLICATION PORTALS AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE STATE REPORTING MECHANISMS. MOVING TOWARD- THE- ATTACHED FOR COLLEGE FOR- I'LL BE BRIEF HERE THESE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WILL HELP THIS UNIQUE AND PROVIDING RESOURCES TO WORK H. WALKER. AS THEIR IMPLEMENTING FINANCIAL AID COME REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MAJORITY LEADER ASK FOR LEADERSHIP AND THAT CALL A LOT MORE FOR STUDENTS APPLY FOR FINANCE AID BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SUPPORT PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED REGIONS WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH- WHAT WE WERE AS COURT OFFICES OR ENTITIES THAT WORK WITH LOCAL SCHOOL- AND IF THE TWO OF HIGHER TO STUDENTS AND TO SCHOOL ARE THE APPLICATIONS FINANCIAL AID. AND FINALLY MOVE TO THE PRECURSOR INSIDE GRANT FOR- WORK VERY GREAT THE EMBLEM THIS PER IN OUR PROVIDE A DOCK. STEVE WITH GREATER ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THREE COMMUNITY SERVICE. AND WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET. TO HELP ADDRESS WANT THE ISSUES THAT WE GET THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. I HAVE HEARD. FROM OUR- PARTNER OVER THE SPURS YEAR TRUE IMPLEMENTATION. WE ALSO AGREED THE L. A. RECORD. BUT THIS REPORTER PURPOSE THAT RESULT IN REDUCING ALL WORKS FOR PART TIME ENROLLED STUDENTS. SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS IS BEEN ANOTHER CONSISTENT POINT OF VIEW FROM HER. PARTNERS ABOUT HOW STUDENTS RESPONDED TO THE TOPIC AND WHILE WE GET THIS YOU NEED TO. DON'T ADMINISTER BETWEEN LOAN PROGRAM AND THE CAMPUS IS FOR YOU SEEN FEW IF YOU WOULD. BETTER DATA FOR YOU WHAT THIS I WOULD JUST NOTE A COUPLE OF THE FACTORS THAT LMAO POINTED TO IN THERE NOW- THAT HAVE IMPACTED PARTICIPATE IN THE DREAM PROGRAM FACTORS AS MORE STUDENTS SHIPPED BACK TO ON CAMPUS LIVING STATUS. AND WE NO LONGER SEE FURTHER INVESTMENT IN EMERGENCY AID- AS A RESULT OF THE COOKER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S BEEN OFFICE TODAY WERE. THOSE BACKED MIGHT WORST TO SYDNEY DREAM OF AND THE NEXT YEARS I THAT CHANGE. OKAY THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE- MISCELLANEOUS BUDGET ITEMS THING NINE I WILL GO TO NUMBER FOUR LET TO. FOR STUDENTS THIS A- INFORMATIONAL ITEM ABOUT THE REPORT AND SOME WORK AT THE SCENE COMMISSION DID. TO TRY TO GET- MORE STUDENTS- LINKED UP TO THE CALPERS PROGRAM TO HELP WITH IT HUNGER NEEDS IN JUST OVERALL COST CALL SO. AS COMMISSION HAVE PLEASE- PROCEED WITH YOUR FINDINGS. THANK YOU YOUR MCCARTY IN A PRETTY THE OP TO PRESENT YOU TODAY ON- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE KNOW IT'S REALLY BEEN WIDESPREAD AND A GROWING CHALLENGE AT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES- AS I THINK THIS COMMITTEES WELL AWARE- STUDENTS REPORTING THAT THEY ARE FOOD INSECURE AND OFTEN GOING HUNGRY. THERE'S CERTAIN SURVEYS THAT THAT YOU NEED COMMISSION IS CONDUCTED WE FOUND ONE OUT OF THREE STUDENTS REPORT BEING FOOD INSECURE AND FURTHER SURVEYS WE FOUND THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC STUDENTS ARE REPORTING THAT THERE. COSTS HAVE ACTUALLY. AND I. RELATIVELY COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVED FRESH BENEFITS FOR WHICH THEY CALL QUALIFY. WHAT DATA IS LIMITED IMAGE AREA AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT POINT LATER ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUED A REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE CALFRESH. THEY FOUND A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS LIKELY IN ROLES. HOWEVER THAT IS OUT OF. FOR HUNDREDS WITH MAKE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. THAT ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR THE CALPERS TRIMS RAM. IT'LL PROMPT OUT THAT THIS AID TO A WORKER AND FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. THAT INCLUDED STUDENTS CAMPUS BAY NEEDS LEADERS RESEARCH EXPERTS AND STOP COUNTY AT A- AND THE LEAD. TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TO ARE NOT ACCESS THIS BENEFIT AND IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR WHICH WE CAN. CONNECT THEM TO CALIFORNIA. TODAY I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE A FEW WITH THE LOVE TAKEAWAY AND RICK. AND IN A REPORT THAT THE FACT BECAUSE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK ACTUALLY SO THIS IS A PREVIEW. OF WHAT WILL BE PUTTING OUT VERY SOON. FIRST WHY ARE SO FEW COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVING CALFRESH. WE HAVE TO OF COURSE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS WERE SPECIFIC STRUCTURED TO KEEP STUDENTS OUT OF THE SNAP PROGRAM THAT WE REFER TO AS CALFRESH IN CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS MUST ACTUALLY. QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO APPLY. AN EXTRA OF PROOF ON STUDENT TO NOT- ONLY APPLY AND MEET FINANCE ELIGIBILITY REQUIRED THAN ANY OTHER. DOES FOR THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO DAMAGED AN ENSURE THAT THEIR COUNTY OFFICE RECORD. THEIR EXEMPTION FROM THE FUNERAL EACH TIME THAT THERE IS A CHANGE IN POLICY AND HOW STUDENT APPLICATIONS ARE PROCESSED WORKOUT. LATER THAT RESULTS FROM FEDERAL OR STATE GUIDANCE THIS MUST BE COMMUNICATED ACROSS AGENCY IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WHICH CAN RESULT INCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES LIKE ALLOWING FOR STUDENTS FILL START HERE. FROM THE STUDENT. THERE ARE OTHER YOU NEED TO ASK OF STATE PARK. THAT HAVE MADE THEIR ACCESS CALFRESH MORE TO. STUDENTS ARE POPULATION THERE OFTEN MOVING FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER AS THEY TRANSITION TO PERFECT. EDUCATION AND THAT'S MADE A COUNTY BASED SYSTEM IT'S COMPLICATED MECCA. FOR TRANSFERRING THE CHALLENGE. THE NATURE OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR AND THE TRAINING OF WEDNESDAY MOVED NEW COUNTY ALSO. A LARGE RECURRING SEASONAL. AND APPLICATION. I THE BALL AND MAKE SURE. MANY COUNTIES WITH LARGE STUDENT POPULATIONS FEEL WAVE APPLICATION HIT AT THE SAME TIME THAT RESULTS IN LONGER PROCESS AND WAIT. FIRST YOU HAVE TO. BUT I'VE TALKED ON THE ISSUE THE HINDERS ACTS TO CAL. I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDED THAT ARE. BY TO HELP BETTER. STUDENTS AND- THE FOR YOU ARE REALLY OPPORTUNE FOR STATE TO BE AND IF THEY DO AND UP NEW APPROACHES THAT WOULD HELP PROMOTE STUDENT ACCESS TO CALFRESH. BURST WE GET PAID THE USE OF REGIONAL OF. THAT CONCERN BUT I THE CURRENT DO THE TRASH PROGRAM FOR AN- THAT WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC A SPECIALLY TRAINED TEAM UP COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS THAT FOCUS ON PROCESS STEVEN APPLICATION. FOR MANY STUDENT WITHIN THAT COMES OF COUNTY. HELLO ALSO. NEXT OF THE ACCESS FOR IMMIGRANT AND ON TOP COMMUNITY. WE WOULD RECKON CONSIDER YOU OF- ON A PILOT BASIS USE OF THE TREE BACKED UP BETTER ALREADY- AND TO THE STATE FOR. PURPOSES THIS COULD ALL SIR AT THE PRIME OR THE GOVERNMENT TAKING MAKING SAME SHE- SO THAT ONCE YOU SUBMIT A FAX UP AND APPLY FOR FEDERAL AID. THEY CAN BE CAN PERSPECTIVE. OF SUBMITTING ADDITION APPLE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE LEVERAGE- BETTER AND IN THE FUTURE WAYS. FIRST CALIFORNIA START TO TRACK ACTUAL. AND NOT AS- STEVE APPLE FROM. WE ALSO LOOK SEE HOW WE CAN AT LEAST PRE POPULATE A CALPERS CHAPEL PATIENT WITHOUT THE DATA TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REDUNDANT. WE ASK PEOPLE AS WELL AS USED READ REVIEWS PRESIDENT DATA WORKING BALLPARK. TO IDENTIFY THAT ARE LIKELY FOR CALFRESH AT THE TRANSITIONING HIGHER TO. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE TO SUPPORT COUNTY AND THEY'RE WORKING PROCESSING. HIS APPLICATION. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR COUNTIES. RECOGNIZE EXISTING WORKLOADS. INCREASE FOR COUNTIES BE. AND A CASES. WE MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN COMMUNITY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. IMPLEMENTING NEW ACCESS POLICIES FOR STUDENTS. ALSO OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND BENEFITS ARE ONLY OF STUDENTS TO BE THAT CAN UTILIZE THAT WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN UTILIZE THEIR CALFRESH BENEFITS ON CAMPUS. BY DRUG COLLEGES IN YOUR- TO PUT EBT CARDS I CAMPUS DINING FACILITY. A GROWING NUMBER OF CAMPUSES I'VE DONE THIS ALREADY WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO DO SO BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE WOK WE CAN DO HERE. SO BACK MY REMARKS HERE BUT I'M OF COURSE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. YEAH SO THIS GOES BACK TO A DISTRO DONALD KIND OF EARLIER ABOUT AID THE FOR PROFIT PHD TO UNDER. HOW HOW TO APPLY AND I KNOW WE YEAR AFTER YEAR WERE OFFERING- PURSUING LEGISLATION AND I'M- LIKE AGAIN DO ONE OF THE BILLS HIS RECOMMENDATION YEAR. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE BIG PICTURE AS FAR AS I MEAN IF YOU THOUGHT WHAT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME IN NOT IN COLLEGE OR THEIR- ARE FOR CALFRESH AND GET IT. WE HAVE THESE- YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE APPLY FOR WHICH YOU KNOW THE FACT KIND OF. SHOW THAT YOU'RE LOW INCOME. SO WHAT STOPPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM SAYING IF YOU'RE A PELL GRANT RECIPIENT. AUTUMN ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S. AND WHY OUT ALL THIS. HEADACHE AND NONSENSE AND THAT IS IT. HI THIS IS SOMETHING I'M MISSING WITH THAT GREATLY INCREASED ENTITLEMENT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS NEVER FIXED AMOUNT THAT YOU TAKE ANYWAY SO HOW DOES THAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. VERY QUESTION- I THERE ARE SOME OUT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE STUDENT POPULOUS- STILL EXIST AND THE- IT SOME PARTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PARTICULARLY AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT. THAT BEING SAID I AM PLEASED TO SHARE THAT CENTER ALEX BETHEA CONGRESSMAN JIMMY GOMEZ FROM OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE BOTH WORK TO A- THAT ISSUE AND TO MAKE. CHANGES TO YOUR FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS LIMITS ACCESS TO THIS MAP PROGRAMMER I'LL FOR SURE. SO THAT WE CAN START GETTING CLOSER TO THAT GOAL OF NOT ASKING A LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO PROVE TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THEY'RE WHAT INCOME AND IT'S JUST. HER THEIR INFORMATION WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES JUST TO GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. TO COVER THEIR BASIC NEEDS AFTER TRYING TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION SO THERE ARE EFFORT UNDERWAY THERE HAVE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME- AS YOU KNOW PHILIP. DIFFERENCES AMONG SOME OF THE MEMBER OF CONGRESS I GET IT BUT LIKE FOR IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE CALVIN RECIPIENTS AND SOME RECEIVE THE PAL THE FEWEST A PAL THAT BASICALLY IS THE FACT IT MEANS YOU'RE- THE LOWER. OF LOW INCOME ACOSTA HAS IT EVER BEEN PROPOSED THAT HAVE. AUTOMATIC FOR CALIFORNIA SNAP BENEFITS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR PARIS. HAS THAT EVER BEEN. ON THE. SO FAR MOST OF THE DISCUSS AND I'M FOR. WITH THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS REALLY RARE TRYING TO HELP. THE ISSUE ROLE THAT KEEP STUDENTS FOR APPLYING CALFRESH IN THE- PLACE- BUT I WILL SAY WE HAD A VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION I JUST MENTIONED. WHO ARE REALLY LOOKING EVEN FURTHER NAP SAY YOU KNOW. WE STREAM THIS BECOME FINANCE AID APPLICATIONS UNDER THAT THE STUDENTS SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS OTHER FORM OF SUPPORT. SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE UNDER WAY NOW BUT- UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FEDERAL LEVEL. YEAH YEAH MEAN WE LOVE FIRST ARGUE CENTER MR PADILLA AND- JIMMY GOMEZ A FORMER. OF THIS ASSEMBLY BUT- IT TAKES MUCH MORE THAN A TWO. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO MAKE THIS A REALITY- WHAT. WHAT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT PIECES OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT- WOULDN'T HAVE THE IS MUCH OF A FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT WE CAN DO RIGHT AWAY. ID LIKELY THAT WOULD BE- CONSIDERING HOW WE CAN BETTER LEVERAGE DATA AND START TO ACTUALLY TRACK STUDENT APPLICATIONS INTO THE PROGRAM AND WHAT THE ENROLLMENT RATES ARE WHAT MECHANISMS THERE ARE FOUR CONNECTING K. TWELVE DATA- FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION DATA WITH BURKE COUNTY OFFICES SO THAT CAN TRY TO PRE POPULATE SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE GOING OUT- THOSE ARE. CRAP LEFT AND THAT THE REQUIRE NEW ON EXPENDITURE AWAY SOME OTHERS- PROPOSAL MIGHT THERE DID TECHNICALLY THAT AND WHEN WE OF COURSE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AND THAT THERE ARE. TRANSACTION WAS THAT THIS SERVICES AGENCIES ARE MAKING IN THEIR DATA PLATFORMS THAT WILL MAKE THIS- NOT A D. V. BUT PERHAPS THAT'S LOWER COSTS. THE OTHER OF COURSE THAT I WOULD I WOULD HAVE TO CALL IT TEN TO WOULD BE PILOT PRO WERE NOT CAN THE STATE TO AND PEOPLE AND I GOING. PROPOSAL BUT REALLY TRYING NEW AND ENDED. LIKE THOSE REACH HUB SO THAT WE CAN SEE IF WE DO HAVE TEAM THAT UNDERSTAND THESE SPECIAL RULES FOR STUDENT APPLICATIONS AND- SHE WAS CERTAINLY ARE QUITE IS DOWN BY THE- LINE THE WAY THAT THE KERR SYSTEM IS- WE THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REAL IMPORTANT UPPER. FOR US TO BETTER HOW WE SERVE THESE. AND MANAGEABLE FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE AND I'M FINE I WOULD NOTE TRANSITIONING MORE HURT IS- UNIVERSITIES TO BE A EXTRA IT EVEN BETTER. IS ANOTHER PIECE WHERE WE KNOW SOME INSTITUTION ARE ALREADY DOING THIS PROJECT- AND WE CAN LEGISLATION OR SMALL TARGETED PLANNING GRANTS COULD BE USEFUL PER THAT. AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS FASTING NINE THANK YOU FOR- PRESS TODAY HOLD THIS IS OFTEN WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO THE FOR CALIFORNIA'S LIBRARY- IS THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WE HAVE. BUDGET THAT FIFTH HARMONY FINANCE. FINISH STATE LIVE WILL. THE PRESENT TO US. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. COME MISTER CHAIR AND I MEMBERS JENNIFER WITH THE OF FINANCE THE STATE LABOR AUGMENT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE CONTINUE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMPHASIS ON ACCESS EQUITY AND INNOVATION THEY GOT BUDGET PROPOSED EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING JOURNAL FINE AND ONE POINT FIVE A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FERTILE SUPPORT AUGMENTATION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THIRTY MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TOTAL. SIXTEEN LIKE GREEN BAY INCLUDE DIGITIZATION OF SICK MATERIAL FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY MILLION OF WHICH TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION AS MY TIME GENERAL FUND AND ONE THREE MILLION AND ON TO TURN OUT FINE AS WELL AS ONE OF THE LIBRARY FOR NINE ON JOURNAL FUND FOR AND RUN TOOK FOR THE LIFE RECORDS TO A TWO POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. OF ONE TIME AND FOR STATE LIBRARY INCLUDE DOCTOR AND FOR TO AT EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND WHICH IS A CONTINUATION OF ONLINE UPSKILLING AND PER TO SERVER TO LIFE PEACH WHICH IS CURRENTLY BY FROM FEDERAL AMERICAN BREAST CANNOT OF TWENTY TWO ONE WE THE ACTUAL MY PRIEST. I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY FURTHER AS REQUESTED OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU L. L. ARTISAN CONCENTRA SOLELY. UP FOR THE WEIRD BACK MIND. BE HAVING A CHEMICAL BUT HOPE YOU CAN SEE STILL HEAR ME- SO I WOULD DIRECTOR TO PAGE TWENTY THREE OF YOUR AGENDA THAT LED THE FOR PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY. ARE SUCH DIFFERS BRIDGE PROPOSALS ALL GO THROUGH EACH ONE QUICKLY GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR- DIGITIZATION ACTIVITIES WE THINK THE OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVE THIS PROPOSALS REASONABLE AND A LINE WITH THE STATE LIBRARY'S CORE MISSION. OF FOR HISTORICAL ASSETS. THAT'S IT IS A MORE FACETED. IT COVERS MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVE. TO THAT THAT'S LIBRARY- IT'S ON TRACK AND MEETING ITS AND MILESTONES. HANFORD OPEN FOR FUTURE BUDGET DECISIONS AROUND TO DITCH THE EFFORTS WE RECOMMEND SOME OF THE REPORTING OF IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING FOR THE AND. ON THE EIGHT POINT EIGHT CHEN FUND FOR. THE LIBRARY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WE THINK YOU COULD VIEW THIS AS A PILOT SO CURRENTLY THE STATE LIVE SPENDING POINT FOR ME DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS- OPERATE A YEAR OF THE- THIS PURPOSE WOULD FUND TO GET YEARS FOR TOTAL OF THREE YEARS TO. SORT OF ASSESS HOW THE INITIATIVES WERE. OUR CONCERN HERE IS THE STATE LAW. STILL COLLECTING INFORMATION ON THE FIRST IS HAVE BEEN SO ISN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION AVAIL YET- THE STATE LIBRARY DOESN'T YET HAVE A- OF THE NUMBER OF PORTS. DOESN'T HAVE. IT DEMOCRATS INFORMATION PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS DOESN'T YET HAVE DATA ON PURCHASE IT ALL COMES. THE STATE LABOR WHAT ABLE TO PROVIDE A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF COURSE HOURS THAT INCLUDE COMPLETED SO FAR. WHEN WE CONVERTED THAT TO A ON FG BASE SIMILAR HOW WE FIND WORK FOR PROGRAMS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HAVE MADE IT IT WAS A FORTY FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS I KNOW SUGGEST THE COST OF AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. THAT'S A LOT HIGHER THAN THE RATE THE STATE PAYS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. I CAN BECAUSE INITIATIVES ONGOING IT LIKELY STILL WILL COLLECT MORE COURSE HOURS THERE WAS A LIBRARY WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT INFORMATION. ABOUT JUST GIVEN ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES WITH THIS INITIATIVE WE- A RIDGE THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. STILL GIVING THE STATE LAW OPPORTUNE TO. REAP THE- AND IF THE THEATER DRESS THE CONCERNS WE RAISE OUR TO COME BACK TO LEGISLATURE TO BUDGETS LIKE. FOR FUNDING. ON THE PROPOSED FIVE MILLION. FUND FOR LOGICAL. WE'VE THERE ARE TWO OF. ISSUES CONSIDER. THE FIRST IS THAT SATE IS CURRENTLY FUNDING A SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM TO EXPAND- A SUMMER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES IT'S CALLED EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY PRO. THAT PROGRAM COULD ALSO- IN PURCHASE A- THE- YET THOSE IS A LITTLE UNCERTAIN. ANALYSTS ISSUE CONSIDER THAT THIS ARGUMENT. IS UP OF SOMETHING AMOUNT TO THE EXIST BASE SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM. AND YET THE IMAGE. DOESN'T PROPOSED. GUIDANCE WITH SO GIVEN THOSE CONCERNS WE RECKON TO WATER. FIRST MAKING THE FUNDS LIMITED TERM RATHER THAN ONGOING FOR EXAMPLE FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEDGER TO. REVIEW THE IMPACT OF THE AUGMENT. AND ALSO WERE THE OF OTHER AFTER. AND THEN SECONDLY- THAT THE FUNDING BE CONNECTED TO OUR STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO REPORTING LANGUAGE AND TO THE VALUATION. AND THEN FINE ON THAT TO PULL TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RENTAL COSTS WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PROPOSAL RECOMMEND YOU DOCTOR. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- WE HAVE A REPRESENTED FOR THE STATE LIBRARY. WELL MISTER LUCAS HERE. LUCAS I THINK YOU'RE A MUTED SO HE CAN'T HEAR YOU OXTED THE WAY MRS LUCAS LIKE THAT- WHAT YOU'RE PLEASURE MISTER TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THE FOUR ITEMS THE CHASE JUST WENT THROUGH OR FOCUS ON THE ONE THAT. PRESENTED IT'S YOUR CALL YOU KNOW HOW POWER YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED YOUR TIME. WELL MAYBE THE THEY HEARING- JASON JUST WENT THROUGH THE FOUR MAIN ITEMS FOR THE STATE LIBRARY BUT THE FIRST ONE- INVOLVES. WHAT DIGITIZATION PROJECTS FOR US WE SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE L. A. O. TO DO REPORTING- THAT'S BOTH THEM TO HOW THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IS BEING USED AND IT'S HELPFUL TO US TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUR BENCHMARKS- THIS IS AN PART OF OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY IS THE- SORT OF PREMIER RESEARCH LIBRARY THAT THE FIFTH LARGE ECONOMY AND THE MOST. GROUP OF PEOPLE EVER BROUGHT TO GET AS EQUALS IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN CIVIL TO SIR THE SECOND ITEM- REGARDING THE FOUR POINT MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR FOR TWO YEARS TO PROVIDE A SERIES OF JOBS SKILLED TRAINING WORK DEVELOPMENT- THE- PUT THE REASON WE PUT IN THE BUDGET REQUEST. AND AS FOR SAYS SAID US I'M THE REASON THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTING ABOUT BUT- IT IS TO HELP CREATE- ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THE TAP NOW IS IT IS THE PANDEMIC MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN ENTERING LIBRARIES THROUGH THEIR DIGITAL DOORS AS OPPOSED TO THEIR FRONT DOORS. AND ONE OF THE- TOOLS THAT THAT BUT- COULD THINGS LIKE OKAY SO HOW DO I RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC HOW DO I MAKE. CAREER SHIFT MANY CAN SEE ALL THESE SORT OF DIFFERENT TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING THROUGH. NO SHOES WHAT THEY CALL A- THE- DARK IT THERE'S SNAPPY THE GREAT RENTS A- AND- TO THE L. A. DOES WE ASK FOR THE IT TWO SO THAT WE COULD GATHER INFORMATION ON THE BY OF THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST I MEAN IT'S THINGS LIKE COURSERA IT'S LINKED IN LEARNING IT'S- SO IF ANY OF US IN THE ROOM WANTED TO SUBSCRIBING PARTICIPATING ANY OF THOSE IT WOULD BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET A FULL RIGHT TO GET A FULL MEMBERSHIP IN EACH OF THOSE THINGS AND IT'S REALLY. IF YOU TAKE A STEP- IT'S A VERY COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT TO MAKE THESE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO. FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS RIGHT OR ANY CALIFORNIANS NEEDS IT. THROUGH THEIR LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEM ON A STATEWIDE BASIS- AS OPPOSED TO ON AN INDIVIDUAL OR EVEN ON A LIBRARY JURISDICTIONAL BASIS. THE THIRD ITEM WAS. AT THE LIBRARY- I WAS JUST BEFORE THIS MEETING ON A PHONE CALL WITH- SENATOR. OFFICE AND WE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME TALKING ABOUT- THE FACT THAT SO MANY KIDS. WHO GET A MEAL DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR SO HUNGRY IN THE SUMMER. AND IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF A- FIGURES ARE THREE MILLION OUT OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS- ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR SUB. FEDERAL LUNCHEONS. OF THOSE THREE MILLION KIDS. TEMPERATURES WE'RE GETTING A MEAL IN THE- IN THE SUMMER. AND LIBRARIES CAN'T CAN SOLVE THAT WE'RE NOT TO GET JENNIFER TO A 100% BY INVOLVING MORE LIBRARIES. BUT IN THE SHORT TIME THIS PROGRAM'S BEEN IN PLACE IT'S INCREASE FROM SEVENTEEN LIBRARIES PARTICIPATING APPROX TWO HUNDRED. THE YEAR BEFORE THE- TO EVEN DURING PANDEMIC WHEN PHYSICAL FACILITIES WERE CLOSED WHY BIRDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS AND- ADDED TO THE EQUATION SOMETHING THE OTHER SUMMER MEAL SITES DON'T. WHICH IS THE IN RICHMOND AND READING OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIBRARIES PROVIDE SO LONG WITH THOSE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EXCUSE ME ALONG WITH THOSE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS LIBRARIES PROVIDED A HUNDRED NAY THOUSAND. THREE BOOKS TO KIDS RIGHT AND THAT'S BY FAR THE CHEAPEST- WAY OF CREE MORE OF CREATING STRONGER READERS IN THE STATE IS PROVIDING THEM WITH BOOKS AT HOME. SO ALSO A I MEAN I'M JUST PASS I MEAN THE LET'S. IN THE GOT. MEANS OF THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE KID WHO'S HUNGRY. OF CIRCUMSTANCE IS GETS A MEAL THE SCHOOL YEAR BUT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INVEST PLUS THERE'S ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE NO DOLLAR IN THE- TO MAKE IMPROVE TO THE- SCHOOL. CAFETERIA KITCHEN SO. FROM THE MY- THE TEAM LIKE A FIVE NINE DOLLAR AND- TO GET STILL TO MAKE IT EASIER MORE LIBRARIES TO PARTICIPATE IN FEEDING HUNGRY KIDS IN THE SUMMER AND- CREATE THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE GOING TO FEED EVEN MORE KIDS.
