GOOD AFTERNOON WE'RE GOING STARTED WITH OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING. A UTILITY WELCOME TO UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO A DISCUSS AS YOU'LL SEE ON OUR AGENDA OF THE. CALIFORNIA FIRES FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WE HAVE AS OUR SPECIAL GUEST. THE PRESIDENT OF THE CPUC OF MICHAEL J. PICKER. HOW AS ALL OF YOU KNOW AND ARE NOT? A LOT OF OUR STAFFS AND CERTAINLY OUR. CONSULTANT STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING AND DEALING EXTENSIVELY WITH DISCUSSIONS AROUND. OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES ON OUR COMMUNITIES. AT EFFORTS TO REBUILD AND PLANNING TO PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE FUTURE. AND WE HAVE A UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS COMMUNITY IN THIS COMMITTEE. TOEXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THOSE FIRES HONOR UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. ELECTRIC AND THE IMPACT ON REPAIRS AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE TODAY'S HEARING. OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE WILL LIKELY LEAD TO FURTHER HEARINGS ON FIRE. THREAT IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT STEPS CAN BE TAKEN TO MITIGATE FIRE HAZARDS. TO OUR UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECT RATE PAYER EXPOSURE. TWO RELATED EXPENSES AND SOME INSTANCES UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OR BE THE CAUSE OF FIRE. AS SUCH IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECT OF FIRE SAFETY AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. WE MUST ALSO BE COGNIZANT OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CAUSATION AND NEGLIGENCE AS IT RELATES TO UTILITY LIABILITY. THE LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THESE ISSUES WE NEED TO EXPLORE THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TODAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OF THE CHAIRMAN. OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. MICHAEL PICKER AND SO WELCOME HIM A TO COME FORWARD. AT THIS POINT IN JOINING HIM. IS THE DIRECTOR OF CPC CPUC SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. ELIZA DATA. MALASHENKO. FEEL LIKE I'M AT THE OLYMPICS OPRAH DID A GOOD JOB IN. I DIDN'T PUT YOUR NAME TO BET. WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. HERE. SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR ACTIONS. SURE. HOUSES BETTER. OKAY. THANKS KINDA HARD TELL FROM HERE. AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ISSUES WE EXPECTED FACE THIS YEAR. BUT I THINK THAT WE WERE ALL VERY VERY MINDFUL OF LAST YEAR'S CATASTROPHIC FIRES AND WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME BOTH LOOKING AT THEM AND PARSING THE MOUNTAIN SPEAKING TO OTHER LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES. I I DO WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALICE STEBBINS. SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN. TO ACTUALLY ACT IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WERE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE ATTRACTED OR TO COME TO WORK WITH US. SHE IS CURRENTLY BASIN SACRAMENTO MOST BE SPLITTING HER TIME I THINK IT'S IT KINDA SPEAKS TO OUR NEED TO DECENTRALIZE AND TO BE CLOSER TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WHO LIVE WITH THAT THE YOU THAT THE. BENEFITS IN THE CHALLENGES OF THE UTILITIES THAT WE REGULATE. AND ALSO MARY MET WHOSE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY. DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SORRY. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN TERMS TO RANK. SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS WE LOOK AT LAST YEAR'S ADVANCE AND THEN I WILL TALK SOME ABOUT. THE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED AS THE IN THE COURSE OF OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE. TRYING TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF. ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ON. FOREST IN WILD LANDS AND I COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY PROTECT THAT INVALUABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST FIRES ITSELF WHETHER THEY ARE CAUSED BY LIGHTNING OR BY. BY OTHER UTILITIES ARE SOME OTHERS HOW FORCE. SO JUST KIND OF A FRAME. SINCE THE SINCE I'VE I'VE GOTTEN TO THE P. YOU SEE I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD A YEAR WHERE THERE ISN'T SOME KIND OF A CATASTROPHE THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED. WE ACTUALLY PREPARE FOR MOST OF THEM BUT WHEN THEY OCCUR THEY TEND TO REALLY OCCUPIER ATTENTION AND TEND TO. DISTRACT FROM THE MANY OTHER TASKS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. COMMISSIONER PETER MAN WHO'S BEEN THERE LONGER AND I HAVE KIND OF REPORTS THAT THIS IS HER OBSERVATION AS WELL. AGAIN. THE DAY THESE THESE THESE THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOT REALLY SIMILAR THEY INCLUDE SUCH DIVERSE THINKS IS THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT LOCATED WEEK PORTION THE TRANSMISSION GRID. GAS PIPELINE EXPLOSIONS UNCONTROLLED LEAKING UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE WELLS DROUGHTS FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES AND NOW WE WILL ON THAT THEM THOSE THE STATE'S MOST CATASTROPHIC FIRES WHICH A CAR AND WHAT LOOKS TO BE EXCEPT FOR TODAY. AAAH A YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON. SIR THIS IS THE FACT THAT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE. A A A IS THE HAVE AT THE HEAD HELLFIRE IS ALSO OBSERVING. SO I'M PERSONALLY AFRAID THAT DESPITE THE PREPARATIONS THE P. YOU SEE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE MAKING. THE SCALE THE SEVERITY IN THE FREQUENCY OF THESE MAJOR DISASTERS WITCHER SOME WHAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. MAY PROVE TO OVERWHELM OUR PLANNING ARE TIGHTER RULES IN OUR RESOURCES THE THE FEROCITY OF LAST YEAR'S WIND STORMS AND THE RELATED FIRES ARE FAR BEYOND PAST EXPERIENCE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF METEOROLOGY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY WERE SEEING THE CUTTING EDGE OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT ANYWAY THE YOU LOOK AT IT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH WE HAVE A REASONABLE BASIS TO PREPARE. SO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ENDED THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA'S RECORDED HISTORY. COMPANY BY A MASSIVE DIE OFF OF PINE THE FROM PARK PEEL INFESTATIONS. THERE WERE SPREADING DUE TO WARMER A WINTER TEMPERATURES THE NOW LEAVE US WITH A LEGACY OF FUEL FOR HIGH FIFTH OWNERS SIERRA FOREST FIRES. THIS DROUGHT ENDED WITH THE ONE OF THE WETTEST SEASONS ON RECORD. WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. PHONE. THAT WET SEASON ALSO CREATED ADDITIONAL FIRE FUELS AND MUCH OF THAT THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AND IN THE WILDLAND INTERFACE THAT DUH THAT. CONSTITUTES WHERE PEOPLE'S COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY ARE POSITIONED WELL WITHIN. HIGH HAZARD FEEL AREAS. AND THEN. THOSE FIRES AGAIN OR. ARE OUTSTANDING EVEN IN THE STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT'S NO STRANGER TO. TURF TURFED OUR REGULAR FIRES. THE FIRES ON A REGULAR BASIS THE THOMAS FIRE IS THE STATE'S LARGEST IN RECORDED HISTORY THAT FIRE RESULTED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TO NINETY ONE THOUSAND ACRES BURN TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED. AND. TRAGICALLY FORTY SEVEN SIX A HOME LIVES LOST QUOTING THE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CONDITIONS FOR THE THOMAS FIRE. ARE NOTABLE BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY DEPICT THIS NEW NORMAL THAT WERE LIVING IN. THIS IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECTED TEN YEARS AGO BUT IT'S BECOMING THE NEW NORMAL NOW. CALIFORNIA REPORTED ZERO TWO ONE PERCENT HUMIDITY CONDITIONS AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES BURNED IN JUST THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF THE THOMAS FIRE. AND I THE SANTA ANA WINDS WERE FAR LESS FORGIVING THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN AND LASTING FOR TEN STRAIGHT DAYS. THERE'S ARE THERE'S LITTLE QUESTIONS THAT SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS WE'RE EXPERIENCING ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT LONGER. SO WE'VE BEEN PERFORIN FOR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS AND ALL DISCUSS SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE PUT INTO PLAYED A MAN MITIGATE THE RISK OF FIRE. WE GOT TO BE PREPARED TO PREVENT FIRES WERE WE CAN. WHERE THE ROOT CAUSES MAY POINT ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS A SOURCE OF IGNITION? WAR WHERE THEY'RE EXCITED FROM OTHER SOURCES AND WHERE WERE PROTECTING A VERY VALUABLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RATE PAYERS WHO'VE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TO PUT INTO PLACE. SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONGOING EFFORTS HAS BEEN TO REBUILD OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AT THE CPUC. OUR I WON'T SPEND TIME HERE. HOA SINCE ARE THE DIRECT OF THE VISION LISA VADA MALASHENKO IS JOINING US HERE FROM FROM THE LOS ANGELES US. CAN SPEAK TO SUM OF THE STUFF WE'VE DONE WITHOUT AROUND FIRE SAFETY. BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT STEPS WE TOOK WAS TO HIRE HER IS EXCEPTIONALLY CONFIDENT DIVISION DIRECTOR TO HELP BUILD THE TEAM SPECIALIST TO FOCUS ON PUTTING SAFETY FIRST. ANOTHER IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATES SAFETY AGENCY SO UNDER OUR. DIRECTOR MALASHENKO IS LEADERSHIP WE'VE ADOPTED TWO OH AGREEMENTS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND WITH CAL FIRE STATES OF FIREFIGHTING IN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR WORKING CAO FIRE SPIN TO TRANSFORM THE STATE FIRE MAPS FROM ONE OF THE MODELS GENERAL FIRE HAS USED TO THE STATE OF THE ART MODEL WHICH FOCUSES ON IGNITION RISKS. DUTY TILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN DROUGHT EXTREME FIRE WIND EVENTS. SO WE'VE ALSO ON STRENGTHENED THE RULES FOR MANAGING VEGETATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO ELECTRONIC AND TELECOMMUNICATION PULLS AND DISTRIBUTION. I DON'T MEAN TO TO TO PUT ALL THE WEIGHT HOA AND. HIGH AND THE ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE SOME FIRES ARE CLEARLY RELATED TO FAILURE OF FULL OF TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE COLOCATED ON THOSE POLLS WITH ELECTRIC. LINES. SO WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO DEVELOP A A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE OF THE FOUR POINT TWO MILLION. BORDEN POLL SICK CARRYING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHO OWNS THEM. THEY'RE UPDATED CONDITIONS. WHAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. AND THEY'RE LOADING OF INFRASTRUCTURES THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY WINS AND THEN SPENDING ACTUALLY CREE INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR FAILURE IN HEAVEN AND RISK OF OF OF PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD. SIR REFINING NEW RULES FOR ENFORCEMENT WHICH WERE LACKING WHEN. TELECOM EQUIPMENT ISN'T WELL MANAGED OR ISN'T CHANGED OVER A DIE IN A TIMELY FASHION OLDER WEAKER POLLS TO NEW PALTZ. ZA COMMON PROBLEM WHERE AT THE TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT UTILITIES ARE ALL USING A WOODEN POLE. DON'T MAKE THE CHANGEOVER TO A NEW STRONGER PULL ALL THE SAME TIME. SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO DIRECT EMAIL SHE COULD DISCUSS OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE IN THE NEW HAS YOUR FIRE HAZARD MAPS THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE DOCKED AT OUR FIRST FIRE HAZARD MAP IS IN TRUMP. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF CALIFORNIA THEY WANTED THEIR FIRE SCIENTISTS TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY COLLECT MORE DATA. IN THE COURSE OF THAT PROCESS THE SCALE OF THAT DONUT THAT FIRE HAZARD. INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. BUT I THINK WHAT I WILL DO IS POINT OUT TOP LINE THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO THESE AREAS OF. ELEVATED AND SEVERE FIRE RISK THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE TO THE HILLSIDES ARE MOVING INTO THE CHAPARRAL THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE WELL FOR US. IN THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE OCCURS BOTH IN. IN SOME OF THE MAJOR URBAN AREAS SENATE DICKERSON SOME OF THE THOUGH THE LAST DANCE COUNTIES. WELL WE FIND THAT NEARLY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA'S NOW LIVE IN THIS FOR HIGH FIRE. RISK AREAS THAT ARE DEFINED BY THE NEW FIRE HAZARD MAP. THAT'S TEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT COACH PEOPLE. YEAH AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN THE THE SIZE OF THE FIRE RISK AREAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY THE PREVIOUS FIRE MAP. WHICH IS INTERFERE THREAT MAP COVERED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES THE NEW MAP MORE THAN DOUBLES THAT AT SEVENTY ARE PLUS THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THAT'S FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDMASS. FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL STATE DOES SURFACE AREA. THE NEW MAP ALSO INCLUDES THE THE TREE MORTALITY. HIGH HAZARD ZONES. WHICH ENCOMPASS NEARLY MINE MILLION ACRES IN ABOUT. HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES THAT DIE DUE TO DREW DROUGHT AND EMBARK BEATLES MUCH OF THAT IS IN THE HIGH SIERRAS WHICH IS LESS DENSELY POPULATED HAS LESS ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER OUT FROM. THE DENSER URBAN CONCENTRATIONS THEIR NEED AND DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUES. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE POLLS THOSE WIRES GO OUT TO THOSE HOMES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. BUT. AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT'S ESSENTIAL IS THAT WE'VE CREATED THIS VAST NETWORK OF POLES AND WIRES IT CONNECTS EVERY HOME. EVERY BUILDING EVERY BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BRINGS NOT ONLY ELECTRICITY. BUT PHONE SERVICE. CABLE SERVICE AND FOOTBALL GAMES AND IT BRINGS PEOPLE ARE AND THE INTERNET. THAT BECOMES ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE PER DOLLAR SPENT. THOSE WOODEN POLES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE SONNET IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. THE TO CONSUMER INVESTMENT AND CONSUMER VALUE. THAT WE MAKE. ON THE THEN YOU HAD THE ANCILLARY INFRASTRUCTURE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTROL AND MANAGE. THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE GET OVER THOSE POLLS WERE TALKING ABOUT A VAST MACHINE. THAT IS ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE PROBABLY MORE VALUABLE THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMODITY ELECTRONS THAT FLOW LONG. SO ARM. THAT SAME TIME THOUGH THERE'S ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSING UNITS AND AND THREE POINT NINE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS. THIS IS DID ABOUT TAUGHT TO IN A THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD ALL. LINES THAT CROSS THROUGH THE EXPANDING FIRE HOUSES ZONES TO SERVE THOSE POPULATIONS THAT ALL COMES WITH AN INHERENT RISK OF FAILURE. KERN THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ALL OF THIS WILL REQUIRE A SUSTAINED EFFORT BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ALL OF US TO STEP UP. ANNA AND DON'T THINK IT'S JUST THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES THE REGULATORS WE SEE A LARGE NEED FOR LOCAL LAND USE PLANNERS TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THIS. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT OUR. REALLY. A CHALLENGE BUT WE NEED REAL CENTRAL MANAGEMENT OF THIS VALUABLE GRID. AND. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IF YOU GO INTO THE TO THIS NEW NORMAL AND I JUST SAY PARENTHETICALLY. THAT I'M. I'M NOT. I'M NOT REALLY. FOR UTILITIES AGAINST UTILITIES HAVE NOT FOR OTHER FOR WAYS THAT PEOPLE GET THEIR ENERGY OR AGAINST THEM. I AM HERE TO SPEAK FOR THE THAT THAT INANIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SO VALUABLE TO US THAT THAT NEVER HAS A VOICE. I REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR SOMEBODY TO SPEAK TO THAT NETWORK. ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT MANAGES THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALONG THAT NETWORK THAT CONNECTS OF THOSE HOMES. AND BUSINESSES IN COMMUNITIES AND BRINGS THEM INTO THE TO TO THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE THING THAT I STAND FOR HERE. IS. BOTH. BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. MAINTAINING IT. KEEPING IT SAFE BECAUSE SAFE INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T HURT OTHER PEOPLE DOESN'T HURT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE TO REPLENISH IT AS TIME GOES ALONG THAT IS MY MY MISSION IN AT THE P. C. STUDENT REALLY SPEAK FOR THE UNANIMOUS. IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S A HARD CONCEPT TO GET ACROSS. BUT WITHOUT SOMEBODY TO REALLY STAND FOR THAT. IT WILL FAIL. IT WILL FAIL. WE CAN'T JUST BE A POLICY AGENCY WE CAN'T JUST BE A FINANCE AGENCY. WHO HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED ROLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE GOOD THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHINING CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ULTIMATELY THE BENEFICIARIES? ALLOWING THE WAY SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE THAT VOICE FOR THE INANIMATE. SO TIME AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE GRID ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PIECE MAILED OUT EASILY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GIVE TO FIFTY A. KICK COUNTIES IN FOREIGN FIFTY EIGHT CITIES AND EXPECTED TO WORK. EFFECTIVELY. IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOME CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT SO THAT AT THE AT THE BORDERS OF ALL THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL JURISDICTIONS YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT VOLTAGES. YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT DOES OWN CYCLES OF ELECTRIC FLOW YOU DON'T HAVE CHANGES IN THE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS. SO SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT CENTRAL MANAGEMENT THAT IS UNLIKELY TO GO AWAY ANY MORE THAN THEY NEED TO HAVE. ONE ROOF CENTRALIZED AGENCIES TO POLICE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST THE OF ENCROACHMENT BY VEGETATION. AND TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST THE THE RISK OF FIRE ELECTROCUTION. SO I'D I'D I'D BOY JUST KINDA SAY. THAT. PEOPLE HAVE FLEXIBILITY WHERE THEY CAN CLING GET THEIR ELECTRICITY. NOT HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY ON THE POLLS. AND SO. HER NEW FIRE RULES ARE JUST THE TOUGHEST IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY'LL BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT. TO WE CAN GET BETTER AT SETTING STANDARDS AND WE CAN REQUIRE MORE EXPECTATIONS AND MORE MAINTENANCE. BUT WITH THIS EXPANDING FIRE RISK FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WITH THE SEVERITY OF THE FIRES THE FREQUENCY THE FIRES THE GROWING POPULATION THIS FIRE ZONES. THE ON GOING REQUIREMENTS FOR. INFIX RUPTURE THEY CARRY RESIDUAL RISK IN A IS AT RISK OF FIRE IS PERFECT SAFETY IS REALLY GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SAYS THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE LAST MONTH WE CAN'T JUST FIGHT NATURE WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH HER. SO I GUESS WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS NEW NORMAL AND DIE WE NEED TO START OPERATING DIFFERENTLY FROM THE GROUND UP. AND THAT WE ME MAY MEAN THREE HINKING WHERE AND HOW DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AND HOW AND THE NATURE THAT DEVELOPMENT WE HADN'T ON BONK WHERE THE FIRE SCIENTISTS IN THE FIRE ENGINEERS ARE VERY CLEAR. THAT WE NEEDED TO DESIGN HOMES NEW HOMES IN THESE FIRE HAZARD AREAS TO BE MORE RESISTANT TO FIRE. AND THOSE BUILDING CODES ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT THE P. YOU SEE CAN EITHER SAT. OR ENFORCED SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP BOTH WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT THAT UP AND DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK. SELL OUT ALL SHOWED UP HERE IN THE AND. EITHER TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS OR TURN IT TO DIRECTOR MALASHENKO. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. AND LEAD THE SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE CPUC WHICH INCLUDES OVER SLATE OF UTILITY AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PRIME PRIMARY MANDATE OF THE SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT GROUP WAS TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE LAWS CPUC REGULATIONS. AND IN SOME CASES PROGRAMS O.. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS WELL. THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY DONE THROUGH AUDITS INFRASTRUCTURE INSPECTIONS IN THE FIELD AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS. IN THE ELECTRIC SAFETY PROGRAM THE GROUP CONDUCTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY AUDITS A YEAR. NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS THE TYPICALLY LAST WEEK AND A HALF AT THE HEART OF THAT TIME IS SPENT ON INFECTIONS IN THE FIELD. AND AM DEAL THE GROUP ALSO CONDUCTS MONTH THREE HUNDRED INVESTIGATIONS OF SAFETY INCIDENTS AND CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. TODAY I AM GOING TO BEGIN BY PROVIDING YOU WITH SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISK OF WILDFIRES FROM UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN DISCUSS THE ALBUM. A HOW THESE RISKS CAN BE REDUCED AND MITIGATED. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE COMMISSION HAS REQUIRED THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO REPORT ALL KNOWN FIRE. FIRES IGNITED BY ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THE UTILITIES REPORT THAT INFORMATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FOR THE YEARS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS THE LATEST DATA THAT WE HAVE THE UTILITIES HAVE REPORTED ROUGHLY FOURTEEN HUNDRED FIRE IGNITION INCIDENTS. MOST OF THESE ARE MINOR INVOLVING FIRES THAT A LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN EAGER. AND ARE EASILY PUT OUT SO OR EVEN GO OUT BY THEMSELVES. HOW OVER THIS DATA PROVIDES GOOD STARTING POINT FOR BETTER ON THE STANDING THE RISK OF WILDFIRE ADMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE? ABOUT WHAT DOES THE TO SHOWS IS THAT THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL BECAUSE OF FIRE IGNITIONS IS CONTACT FROM OBJECT MOST FREQUENTLY VEGETATION. CONCEPT FROM VEGETATION WITHOUT A FACILITY FAILURE LEADING UP TO THE CONTACT ACCOUNTS FOR ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL EXTENSIONS. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A TREE FALLING DOWN OR BRANCHES FALLING OFF AND A GOING INTO ENERGIZED ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND CATCHING ON FIRE. THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF ADMISSIONS IS UTILITY EQUIPMENT FAILURE MOST FREQUENTLY A CONDUCTOR WILL CONDUCT DISPLACE FAILURE. FAILURE OF CONDUCTORS AND SPLICES ACCOUNT FOR JUST UNDER TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL ADMISSIONS. THEREFORE AN AGGREGATE VEGETATION CONTACT AND CONDUCT THE FAILURE ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST HALF OF WILL OF THE IGNITION'S ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THOSE TWO CAUSES THERE AREN'T VERY CLEAR DRIVERS OF IGNITIONS AND IGNITION NUMBERS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE TEND TO BE MUCH SMALLER. SOME OF THE OTHER ONES INCLUDES A VEHICLE ACCIDENTS ANIMALS BALLOONS OF WIRE TO WIRE CONTACT AND OTHER THINGS. A WELFARE NEEDS THREE THINGS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP ONE IS FUEL. SECOND IS ADMISSION FORESTS AND THREE WEATHER CONDITIONS. WHEN WE THINK OF WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION POLICIES WE CAN THINK OF THE MOST STORY GETTING SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE SLOW WHAT'S KNOWN AS A FIRE TRIANGLE. FIRST WE CAN LOOK AT REDUCING AVAILABILITY OF FUEL. THIS PARTICULAR GIVES TO ADDRESSING THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENTS OF UTILITY RELATED TECHNICIANS THAT ARE WELL OU TO VEGETATION COMING INTO CONTACT WITH ENERGIZED FACILITIES. FOR UTILITIES OPERATIONS PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WELL IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES OF FOUR OF FOR ANY UTILITY. IN OUR CALIFORNIA THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WELL SPEND. PROBABLY. OVER ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THEIR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND IF YOU REALLY COUNT OF ALL OF YOU FACILITIES SO THAT MEANS. THE GAS UTILITIES THAT MAINTAIN RIGHT OF WAYS OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES OWE. IT WE'RE TALKING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HALF A BILLION IN THE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SPENDING JUST IN TRIMMING TREES. SO IT'S A MAJOR EXPENSE IN THE MAJOR ACTIVITY FOR ALL OF THEM IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT EL FOR THE L. FOR THE REASONS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. HOME IN EL CALIFORNIA WE HOW OF. SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT SET OF REQUIREMENTS ANYWHERE ó NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES WITH THE WORLD. EL IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR VEGETATION CLEARANCES THAT THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL. THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE UP TO NORTH THESE BLACKOUTS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. L. AT THE DISTRIBUTION LEVELS THE ONLY STATES THAT HAVE OF THE REQUIRED CLEARANCE LEVELS ARE CALIFORNIAN WHERE AGAIN. ELM AND WE KNOW HOW FOR SOME THE STRICTEST DEL REQUIREMENTS WITH THE FIRE AMOUNTS THAT FURTHER RESTRICTS. ó HOME HOLE ó. TO. CLEARANCES REALM LOW OF IN THE HIGH FILE THREADS LOANS. ELVES SOON WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY DOING ALL ALONG WHAT'S IN TERMS OF OUR POLICIES AND REGULATIONS AL FAR MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. CALM HOWEVER. THIS CONTINUES TO BE. THE SINGLE HOME. MAIN DRIVER OFF IGNITIONS AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE AREA OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENTS TO REDUCE THOSE RISKS. THERE'S SOME ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED THE OUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS DONE THAT WOULD LIGHT OR. TYPE SURVEYING ó YOU CAN LET GO UPLOADS DATA AND USE EL AL ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO BETTER PINPOINTS. O. GROWTH PATTERNS AREAS WHERE. YOU ME HOW OF WELL VEGETATION COMING INTO CONTACT SO THEY EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE A GREAT DEAL ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA ON THAT WAS STOLE CAN BUILD UPON THIS PROGRAMS AND LOOK AT FURTHER. ELM FUEL REDUCTION AT ALL POLICIES RELATED TO UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS A AND THE STATE AS A WHOLE. SECOND WE CAN LOOK AT THAT MISSION CONTROL POLICIES. SO THIS IS AN AREA TO FOCUS ON HARDENING YEAH UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. GOING BACK TO COMMISSION SOURCE THAT THE STAKES OF THIS IS WHERE UTILITIES CAN WORK TO MINIMIZE CONDUCTANCE PLACE FAILURE. ALL THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE CONDUCT THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS. IN USING INFRARED SCANNING TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL WELL SPLICES THAT MIGHT BE HAVING ISSUES. ALSO INVESTMENTS IN GRID MORE IN THIS NATION OR SMART GRIDEL LEASE IN THE PORT AND FOUNDATION FOR WELL IGNITION CONTROL. OF THIS A LAW THAT CAN BE DONE AT TO PREVENT THAT MISSION BY ADVANCE FULL. ANALYTICS AND REMOTELY ADJUSTING SETTINGS ON THE. PROTECTIVE DEVICES SUCH AS RECORDERS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE OF THE IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO THE FROM COULD NOT TEN YEARS AGO BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY WHEN YOU HOW DID WE CLOSER IN AND THE PROTECTIVE DEVICE YOU HALL OF. SETTINGS THAT COME WITH THAT YOU INSTALL IT IN THE FIELD AND THEN IF YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE HOME YOU HAVE TO SEND THE CREW OUT TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO THAT THE VICE IT'S VERY VERY WELL COST PROHIBITIVE TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS ON THE FREQUENT BASIS. IN IF YOU SET THEM TO BEAT SO SENSITIVE THAT REALLY BECOMES A MAJOR RELIABILITY PROBLEM BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU KNOW THE SQUIRREL NINA JUMPS ON THE LINE IT TRIPS IN THE U. HOPES THEN THE CREW AND RESET THE WHOLE THING. SO SMART GRID INVESTMENT THE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT ALBUM IN THE STATE AND THEN PUT POLICY THAT THE COMMISSION HAS PROMOTED. THAT AGAIN A THING FROM A TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW LAYS ON THE PORT AND FOUNDATION THAT WE CAN BUILD UPON SO NOW USE ELM THOSE DEVICES USE THE A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS THAT WE GET SOLID IS HELP THE POOR ID. ALAM AND REALLY BE. SOULES ALUM. TO GET MORE ADVANCED WITH. HOW UTILITIES ARE MANAGING OWE THEIR ELECTRIC SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY DISTRIBUTION BUT HAS TRADITIONALLY? HAVE BEEN THAT THE THE LESS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN TRANSMISSIONS ABOUT STARTING TO CHANGE AND WE HAVE. IN THAT AREA. LASTLY EL PROGRESS ON WELFARE PREVENTION CAN BE MADE BY FOCUSING ON WHETHER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS PRESIDENT PICKERS MENTION WE'VE WELL WITH SISSY AND REALLY SEVERE WEATHER WE HAD THE HARDEST SOMEWHERE IN THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS OF STATE HISTORY. EL FOLLOWED BY UNUSUALLY LONG THIRTY IN THE THIRTEEN DAY PERIOD OF SANTA ANA WINDS MOVES EXTREMELY LOW HUMIDITY. EL THE COMBINATION OF THE WINDS WITH GUSTS OF SEVENTY MILES PER HOUR. OWE AND AVAILABILITY OF FUEL WITH EXTREME GRAY CONDITIONS CREATE THE ULTIMATE ENVIRONMENT FOR MAJOR WILDFIRES TO SPREAD. AND WE REALLY NEED TO START TREATING THESE CONDITIONS LEADING UP TO THE WILD FIRES THE SEEM AS THOUGH APPROACHING HURRICANES AND TREATED ON THE EAST COAST. WELL WE HAVE SOME AREAS LIKE INSANE G. AGO THAT DEALT WITH AND YOU CAN GAS AND ELECTRIC THE HELP INVESTED QUITE HEAVILY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE WEATHER ANALYTICS. THEY ACTUALLY HELP WHAT THE STATION IN EVERY SINGLE CIRCUIT IN HI FI HI FI A THREAT ZONES. AND THE A THEY GET AT TEN MINUTE INTERVALS INFORMATION BACK FROM THOSE WEATHER STATIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE WIND CONDITIONS L. HUMIDITY TEMPERATURE AL AND OTHER INFORMATION ELM THE RUN IN HI FI IS THREATS. CONDITIONS A MILLION SIMULATIONS AND THEY USING A SUPERCOMPUTER. TO DETERMINE. AND RISKS OF WILDFIRE IGNITIONS AND THEY'RE ABLE TO PIN. OF THE OF WITH QUITE HIGH ACCURACY OR WHERE WELL FIRES ARE LIKELY TO START. AND THEY CAN THEN STAGE WELL CREWS. AND ALERT THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO WEAR ALL THOSE AREAS ARE. AND WELL IT SEEK HOME. SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS. TO EITHER PREVENTS THE FIRE FROM SPARKING IN THE FIRST PLACE BOY IF THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO PLEASE BE ON ALERT BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WILD FIRES IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME. ENDS QUICKER YOU CAN PIN POINTS EL THAT THE IGNITION HAS TAKEN PLACE AND DEPLOY A EL OF FIREFIGHTING CREWS TO PUT SOMETHING OUT. OF THE THE HIGH YOU CHANCES ARE THAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PREVENTS ELM A DISASTER. A ONE OF THE ELBOW PROGRAMS THAT SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC USES IS THEY PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZE ELECTRIC LINES EL. AS THE. LAST RESORT MEASURE FOR L. RISK REDUCTION. CALM IT'S A POLL A PROGRAM THAT THE P. C. HOUSE AUTHORIZED FORCE AND YOU GAS ELECTRIC. AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY ANALYZING HOW IT'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE ALMOND AND LESSONS LEARNED THAT CAN BE APPLIED THE TO THE REST OF THE STATE'S. BUT ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THAT PROGRAM FOR THEM IS THAT THEY DO HOME OF THIS VERY GRANULAR BEAD AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. YEAH AND OWE A LOT OF SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES ON THEIR SYSTEMS FOR THE ABLE TO SURGICALLY PINPOINT THE EXACT CIRCUIT THE EXACT LINE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE A PROBLEM. IN WHEN THEY'RE. DOING D. ENERGIZING. THE HOW OF OLD METHODS IN PLACE TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE ALL OF THE. A POLICY THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT WHETHER PREPAREDNESS IN WHAT THE RESPONSE. AND HOW WE REALLY CAN BE ERA GETTING BETTER AT THE STATE'S. O. OF MOBILIZING ELM AHEAD OF A FIRE STARTING. AND REALLY TREATING THOSE FIRE THREAT CONDITIONS OWE THEM AS WELL AS THE STORM AS AN EQUIVALENT. IN THE DISTANCE WORKING ON POLICY THE CPC IS INVESTIGATING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES IN PARALLEL WITH CAL FIRE. LAST YEAR WAS SIGNED IN THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH ALL THAT IN THE BILL'S THE TWO AGENCIES TO BETTER COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE ON INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS. HELP PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THIS AMMO YOU EL THE CPC STAFF CUTS WAITS UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE CALIFORNIA EAR O. INVESTIGATION AND. NO TO DETERMINE BECAUSE BEFORE WE COULD BEGIN OUR OWN INVESTIGATION. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS WELL WE KNOW LONGER HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA OR TWO TO FINISH INCOME WITH CONCLUSIONS WERE SHARING INFORMATION. WELL WITH EACH OTHER AS OUR INVESTIGATIONS ARE GOING ALONG WITH HEALTH DIFFERENT FOCUSES ALAKAL FIRE INVESTIGATION IS REALLY LOOKING AT HOLD THE FIRE GOODNIGHT AND HOW THAT IT SPREAD OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE CPU SEE. IS LOOKING OUT THE UTILITY INVOLVEMENTS ASSAULT WOULD WHO IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE OF VIOLATIONS OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED BUT ALSO EVEN BEYOND VIOLATIONS WERE THERE AND YOU BEST PRACTICES AS ANY LESSONS LEARNED SO OUR FOCUS WAS MORE SPECIFICALLY UTILITIES. AND WORK HEALTH WIRES PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPERTISE THAT SPECIFIC EL TO FIREFIGHTING. AND FIRE MITIGATION ALL WE'RE PROVIDING HELLFIRE WITH EXPERTISE AROUND UTILITY LINES IN AND OUT HOW UTILITY EL NETWORKS WORK. SO IT'S BEEN A VERY FRUITFUL OUR RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK WE CAN THE L.. BUILDING ON THE I FELT THE TWO AGENCIES WERE ONLY BE ABLE TO EVEN BETTER WELL PREPARE AND RESPOND. CALM IN THE FUTURE. WE GO WHEN OUR INVESTIGATIONS WELL CONCLUDE AT ALL THE C. P.% C. L. HOUSE ABILITY TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST UTILITIES WE CAN FIND THEM UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION PER DAY. AND ALSO ASSESS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FEES THAT WE GET INTO AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE. WELL RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS OBVIOUSLY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. AND SO ALSO CALLED. THINK ABOUT. HOW WE CAN BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATION THAT WE ARE DE HOW OF ELM IN THINK ALL OF NEW WELL MEASURES THAT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE? FROM ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE TO FINDING YOU LOW HANGING FRUIT AT THOSE POINTS. WE'VE ALREADY DONE MORE IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND. EL IN YOU LESSONS LEARNED EL. A REALLY COMING FROM. OTHER COUNTRIES AUSTRALIA HAS DONE THE LOTS IN NEW ZEALAND'S IN TERMS OF FIRE PREVENTION AND ALSO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST PRACTICES THERE BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF INNOVATIVE THINKING. ELM TO REALLY MOVE WELL PAST ALL THE LEVEL OMIT WHICH WERE AT TO FIGURE OUT OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING AS THE STATE'S. HOWEVER I THINK WITH THE. WARRANTS CHRONOLOGY THIS AND WITH THE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AMONG THAT THE FRIENDS AND CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. EL WHICH WE CAN'T DO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CAN OUT MADE FURTHER PROGRESS. TWO WELL PREVENT SUCH CATASTROPHIC EVENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. HOME SO THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORKING WITH YOU THE CPC LEADER CHAPA CAL FIRE. L.. TWO I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO FOR THE FUTURE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PRESIDENT BAKER. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. AND AS YOU KNOW WERE ALL TRYING TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND. THIS ISSUE AND HOW IT HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO IT AS AS AS IT RELATES TO THIS COMMITTEE. CERTAINLY WE ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW. ALL UTILITY INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED ARE. CLEARLY OVER STARTED ORIENTED OUR SESSION. AT IN THE LAST YEAR. IS WAS NOT NECESSARILY THE TOPIC THAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO. HEARTACHE OF ALL THE ENERGY FORCE BUT TO NO PUN INTENDED. BUT HERE WE ARE AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO FOCUS ON IT AS YOU POINTED OUT TRY TO EXPLORE BEST PRACTICES TRY TO LOOK AT. WHAT THIS NEW REALITY MEANS TO CALIFORNIA? AS WE CONTINUE INTO A DROUGHT YEAR AGAIN. AT A DROUGHT SEASON AND SO. I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN ALL. THIS IS A TIME WHERE MEMBERS WILL ASK QUESTIONS AND RESPOND TO. OTHERS QUESTIONS IN YOUR PRESENTATION HOW WILL ALSO ONCE THE COMMITTEE HAS EXHAUSTED. ITS QUESTIONS AND HAD DIALOGUE WITH YOU WILL SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE TO. OPPOSE A QUESTION AS WELL IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO JUST SORT OF. JUMP IN THERE IF I COULD AROUND THE ISSUE OF UTILITIES AND IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT. P. GENIE. HAS APPROXIMATELY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN LIABILITY. EXPOSURE. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. AND INSURANCE LIABILITY INSURANCE. WHAT? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO IMPACT ON. THE UTILITY HOW'S IT GOING TO. IMPACT ON THE ELECTRIC. SECTOR AND ALSO IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WILL WANT ME WORK BACKWARD FROM MY. FAVORITE SUBJECT WHICH IS ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE USE UTILITIES IS A WAY TO FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY WE KIND OF GIVE THEM A. A FRANCHISE AND DOES SAY YOU WON'T HAVE COMPETITION WITHIN THIS FRANCHISE AREA. AND DIED MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO THEN X. A JUSTIFY ALL YOUR EXPENDITURES AND THE WAY THAT YOU RECOVER YEAR EXPENSES FROM RATE PAYERS TO US AND WE DO THAT THROUGH WHAT KIND OF A TECHNICAL COURT LIKE THE ADMIRALTY COURTS USED TO. DIVIDE UP THE PRIZE MONEY FROM. FROM NAVAL BATTLES. AND IT'S LITIGATED IN ITS LONG PROCESS AND EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION AND WE GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT AT HAVING THEIR SAY. AND CAN GET DRAWN OUT FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN NGUYEN UTILITIES GO OUT TO BORROW MONEY. THEY GET CHEAP RATES THEY GET REALLY GOOD RATES BETTER THAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BETTER THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FREE QUALITY BECAUSE. THE INVESTORS TO INVEST IN THEIR SHARES WHICH IS ONE METHOD OF FINANCING. KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET A DIVIDEND. AND WHEN THEY BORROW FROM BANKS USUALLY IN THE FORM OF BONDS THEY KNOW THAT THOSE BONDS WILL GET PAID BACK BECAUSE THERE'S A GUARANTEED STREAM OF INCOME TO THEM. SO PEOPLE WERE WILLING TOLEND FAIRLY CHEAPLY THOSE. DOES UTILITIES GO AND BUY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE UP FRONT. AND COLLECT THE COSTS OVER TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. AND THAT'S A REMARKABLY SIMPLE SYSTEM TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A STATEWIDE GRID FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MODERNIZE THAT CREATED TO DEAL WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO MEET IN NEW. ON FIRE HAZARD DUH AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. YOU REALLY WANT IT YOU REALLY WANT TO BORROW THEM MONEY CHEAP. IF. THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY STARTS TO FEEL LIKE PERHAPS IT'S RISKY. TOLAND TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS THEN THEY CHARGE MORE MONEY. WHICH GETS PASSED ALONG TO RATE PAYERS SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KINDS OF FIRE DAMAGES. AND THERE'S NO INSURANCE AND THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE COMING FROM THE UTILITIES TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES. I HOPE THEY START TO WONDER WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO GET PAID BACK. THERE'S A COUPLE OF WRINKLES HERE AT ALL JUST TAKE COUPLE SECONDS TO TO TALK ABOUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT IT GETS HARDER TO FINANCE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE SYSTEM LIKE ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION LIKE BATTERY STORAGE. LIKE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IF IT COSTS A LOT MORE MONEY TO BORROW AND MAYBE WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT'S A CONCERN THAT THAT THAT I HOLD. SO THE REASONS WHY WE'RE SORT OF IN THIS BOX HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE CPUC ACTS COLONEL LIKE A A COURT. AND WE FOLLOW THE LAW. WE HAVE A LONG PROCESS. WE AND THEY PREVIOUS. SETTING MADE. NOTE OF TWO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE CAME UP WITH WHEN WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN APPEALED. AND AS THE JUDICIAL ACTOR AND HALF TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS TO DECIDE ON THAT APPEAL. BERMAN A STICK TO WHAT'S ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC RECORD AND TRYING NOT TO GET. TO DEEP INTO WHAT HAPPENED THERE. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN CERTAINLY ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BROAD PRINCIPLES. BUT TERM. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION TO UTILITIES AND ALL EVENTS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY LOSS WOULD FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UTILITIES. AND THAT THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON UTILITIES FROM INVERSE CONDEMNATION MAY LEAD TO HIGHER RATES FOR RATE PAYERS. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE PARTIALLY DEPEND ON CAPITAL MARKETS TO RAISE MONEY IN THE INSURANCE MARKET TO MITIGATE FINANCIAL RISK IF STRICT LIABILITY IS IMPOSE FOR DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES CAUSED IN WHOLE OR PART BY A UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE RISK PROFILE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY MAY BE QUESTIONED BY INVESTORS AND INSURANCE PROVIDERS ALIKE. THE INCREASE OF AND COST OF CAPITAL AND THEN SHE IN SPENCER SO SHE ADDED WITH INSURANCE COULD LEAD TO THE HIGHER RATES FOR RATE PAYERS EVEN IN INSTANCES WHERE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. COMPLIED WITH THE AND AND I COMMISSION SAFETY STANDARD. CHAU. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PROCEEDINGS IT'S A PRUDENT SEE STANDARD. IT PORT PUTS THE UTILITY AND THE POSITION OF HAVING TO PROVE. THAT THEY WERE PRUDENT. THAT THEY TOOK STEPS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE REQUIRE. AND THAT THEY WERE THOUGHTFUL AND ACTUALLY TOOK EVERY STEP POSSIBLE IN EVERY WAY OF GIVING% A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THAT. I DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION THAT'S NOT STATUTE BUT IT'S AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD PRECEDENT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CHANGE WITHOUT CONSTANT LITIGATION. BOTH OF THESE COULD BE RESOLVED EITHER BY THE COURTS. REFINING THEIR FINDING THAT CREATED THIS DEFINITION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. WHERE BY THE LEGISLATURE TAKING ACTION SO WE HAD SO WE CALLED FOR THAT? IN. AN ADDENDUM TO OUR DECISION TO COMMISSIONERS. DISAGREED IN PART WITH THE PROCESS AND CALLED ON THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR MY KEY POINTS TO YOU IS THAT THERE IS RISK TO THE UTILITY IS TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MANAGER TO REPLENISH IT AND TO MODERNIZE IT. EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT WE ARE STUCK BECAUSE OF OUR OUR PRECEDENT AND BECAUSE OF THE COURT'S DECISIONS. WE ARE OUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY INVITE SOME DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AS TO HOW WE CHANGE OUR PRACTICE. WERE DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO POTENTIALLY HAN HI CHANGED THE LAW THATTHE COURTS TO USING TO FIND THIS. STRICT LIABILITY TEST SO SORRY I'LL BE HAPPY TO EXPLAIN MORE BUT I'M TRYING TO AVOID GETTING TOO DEEP INTO THE TO THE SPECIFIC PROCEEDING. APART QUIRK. ON. I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE ACTUAL ABILITY THAT WE HAVE. TO WORK IN THIS AREA IS. SO. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THAT IT'S ARTICLE ONE SECTION NINETEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. WHICH ALLOWS FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION. JUST TO DEFINE THAT. IT MEANS. ARE IF A FIERY STEAMED BECAUSE BY SAY VEGETATION BEING BLOWN BY SEVENTY MILE AN HOUR WIND. INTO A. LIVE POWER LINE. THAT. UNDER COURT DECISIONS AND AGAIN% NOTHING AND AND JUST AN INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. ARE THERE WILL BE. OF THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE I ENTITY. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. PAY FOR THAT DAMAGE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE OR NOT SO HAVE I GOT THAT RIGHT SO FAR. THAT'S CORRECT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY THE COURTS TO BE STRICTLY LIABLE SO IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE THE PERSON THAT THAT PAYS IF THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE PERCENT OF THE DAMAGE THEN THEY COVER THE WHOLE THING IF THEY ARE THE PER. WHO WAS FOUND TWO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ONE PERCENT? THEY STILL THEY COVER THE WHOLE THING EVEN IF THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE PERCENT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND THEN AND THEN WHAT THEY DO IS RECOVER FROM OTHER PARTIES. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF A FIRE THAT WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAME LOOSE. ARCTIC OVER ELECTRIC LINES CAUSES THEM TO FAULT BUT IT WAS THE THE THE TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE THE TOUCH THE GROUND. BECAUSE IT WAS ON A ELECTRIC POOL. HOME THEY WERE FOUND TO BE THE ELECTRIC COMPANY WAS FOUND TO BE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY THEY DID SETTLE. AND RECOVER SOME OF THOSE OVERALL COST SO IT'D MECHANISM FOR THE COURTS OF ACTUALLY FINDING AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY. FOR ACTUALLY PAYING THE DAMAGES AND FOR BEGINNING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REBUILD THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT I THINK IS THE IS THE THE POLICY BEHIND THE LEGAL THEORY. WELL BUT IT IS A LEGAL THEORY THAT COMES FROM THE CONSTITUTION IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME. ARE THAT WE CAN CHANGE INVERSE CONDEMNATION LAW ARE INVERSE CONDEMNATION PRACTICE. NOW JUST THE FACT THAT THE UTILITY PAYS NOT WHETHER ITS THE STOCKHOLDERS TO THE RATE PAYERS GET INTO THAT LATER. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT WITHOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT I CAN ONLY. TELL YOU WHAT MY ATTORNEYS HAVE TOLD ME I'M NOT A LAWYER SOME WELL YOU THEIR BEST WISDOM AND IF FIRE IF YOU. CARE DEBATE THEM I'M SURE I'M NOT GOING TO. AB THAT WOULD HAVE USEFUL TO ME TO TO UNDERSTAND OUR MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL. ARMED DOES ANYONE AND DOCTOR MELANAU SKI DO YOU HAVE. OR DO ANY OF YOUR STAFF THAT ARE HERE. A MISTER PACKER HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON THIS THAT IT IS CA CONSTITUTE THE END FIRST CONTEST. INVERSE CONDEMNATION COMES FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF THE E.. CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I TO CAVE SHAKE IT TODAY WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF LAWYERS NOW. I'M ALSO NOT AN ATTORNEY. ALRIGHT WELL I THINK. AS I UNDERSTAND THE CASES AND SUCH. ARM. WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT REALLY IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS. WHETHER THE RATE PAYERS PAY FOR THAT OR WHETHER IT'S THE. ARE YOU UTILITY STOCKHOLDERS. ARE IF IT'S THE UTILITY STOCK HOLDERS OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ABILITY OF THE UTILITY TO. BORROW AT GOOD RATES DISAPPEARS AND THE RATE PAYERS PAY ANYWAY. ARM. BUT YEAH WHAT YOU'RE ALSO SAYING I JUST WANNA VERIFY THIS. IS THAT UNDER YOUR PROCEEDING. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PEOPLE PROVING THAT. THE UTILITY IS AT FAULT BUT THE UTILITY PROVING THEY'RE NOT AT FAULT GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. OKAY AND YOU'RE NODDING YES THAT WE WILL I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT UNDER THE PRUDENT SEE STANDARD WE OPERATE UNDER THE NAPOLEONIC CODE NOT. OKAY CHILDREN THAT COULD BE CHANGED. ARM BY. ARE BY LEGISLATION AS TO WHETHER IT'S THE RATE PAYERS OR THE. I YOU TO THE OR THE UTILITY STOCKS THERE THINK IT ON A MORE NUANCED THAN THAN THAT AND YANK CHANGING THE THE TEST BY WHICH WE DECIDE THE DECREE. OF INVOLVEMENT SO WHERE WAS THE THIRD THEY IN THE INVERSE COMBINATION WORKS OUT DIFFERENTLY FOR THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. SO PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES BASICALLY JUST COLLECT THE MONEY FROM RATE PAYERS IF YOU'RE SMART WHERE LADWP FOR EXAMPLE. THE BOARD JUST SAYS OKAY WE GOTTA PAY THIS WILL JUST PAY THIS. HERE WE GO THROUGH THIS LONG LITIGATED PROCESS TO DECIDE PRUDENT SEE AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH COMES FROM. RATE PAYERS OR HOW MUCH GUY SHOULD ME HOW MUCH COMES HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH GUILT THERE IS AND IF WE FIND GUILT THEM WE? WE DO RECHARGE IT ALL TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OKAY CHALLENGE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH NUANCE IN HOW WE APPROACH THAT. ALRIGHT WELL SEND ME YOUR LAWYERS OKAY THANK YOU HAPPY TO DO THAT AND LET ME LET ME JUST UNIT IS USED SOME OF THEM I WILL SEND YOU WILL YOU CAN KEEP. MELANIE JUST SOMEONE I WANT I CAN KEEP THANK YOU. FOR LET ME JUST SAY THAT CERTAINLY AS WE START TO FIND ESOS DRIFTING INTO LEGAL. DEFINITIONS AND CERTAINLY NUMBERS COMBINATION WOULD FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE LIMITED ON THIS SUBJECT FOR TODAY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SORT OF UNDER STORE UNDERSCORE. THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT AND HOW TO BE BETTER PREPARED TO LIVE IN THIS NEW NORMAL AND HOW TO. ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT AROUND OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. UP BUT WE WITH THIS WILL NOT BE THEY'LL THE FIRST AND LAST DISCUSSION WILL HAVE ON THIS TOPIC IN THE NEXT TIME WILL OBVIOUSLY. LOOK TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AND MAYBE HAVE COUNSEL HERE. TO EXPLORE A LITTLE BIT MORE THE NUANCES THE. THE FULL RAMIFICATIONS OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE EXTENT OF. HAVING NEW LEGISLATION THAT GIVES YOU DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND WHAT THE. THE GOOD BAD AND UGLY OF THAT MIGHT REPRESENT AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A WHOLE NOTHER CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT. ON THIS ALL TURN TO OUR OUR VICE CHAIR WELCOME BACK MAKE IT PATTERSON GOOD TO BE BACK. FOR A TIME LIKE THIS. WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE CRISIS. ARM. THAT IS LITERALLY GOING TO AFFECT SEVENTY PERCENT. THE POPULATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RECEIVES ITS ELECTRICITY FROM. UTILITIES ON PROBLEM IS THAT BEN PRETTY. WELL DIRECTLY STATUS STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. UTILITIES ARE BEING HELD HER PERCENT LIABLE EVEN IF THEY'RE ONE PERCENT. EVEN IF THEY FOLLOWED ALL APPROPRIATE RULES AND PROCEDURES. AND IT EL. DEBT THAT THIS HAS LED TO ENSURE ABILITY. IT HAS. PROBABLY. TURNED INTO. AT LEAST FOR. PROBABLY AN INVESTOR FOR FREEZE OF OF ABILITY DEBT TO RAISE RATES CAPITAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT ONE I OWE YOU GIVEN A PREMIUM OF A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COVERAGE. THAT'S NOT INSURANCE. BJ IS BBB PLUS. RIGHT NOW. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MARKET LOSSES EDISON TOOK A SIX BILLION DOLLAR. HIT RECENTLY. AYE AM REALLY CONCERNED THAT IF THIS. TREND AND IF THIS ARC OF FACTS CONTINUE. I THINK WE'RE HEADED TOWARD BANKRUPTCY PRIOR USE. I REALLY THINK THIS IS A. COMING. ARE. THE CRISIS. ARE. AND SO I MY FIRST QUESTION IS. DO YOU CONCUR THAT THIS SET OF FACTS CREATES A CRISIS. SO AYE TH TH SHE A CONTINUUM OF CONSTRAINTS ON THE UTILITY CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THEY'RE GONNA FIND IT HARDER TO BORROW I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IF INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE. THOSE ARE TWO OF THE EFFECTS THAT I SEE AT A AT A MINIMUM. THEY MAY HAVE LIQUIDITY CRISES OF THEY MAY CHOOSE TO TO GO FOR BANKRUPTCY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WERE CURRENTLY AT THAT POINT. BUT I'M CONCERNED. COULD YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND. THERE'S A LOOK AT THAT AND LOOK UP WE. AND I JUST THINK WE GOTTA BE PRETTY BLUNT PRETTY PRETTY DIRECT. HERE. DOES THE P. UC THINK THIS WRITTEN RISES TO A LEVEL OF CRISIS AND ARE YOU GOING TO STEP IN AND DO SOME SERIOUS WORK ON A DON'T THE REGULATORY YOU HAVE. OR OR OR DO WE JUST LET THIS UNFOLD. I DON'T THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE HERE IS TAKING STEPS TO WHAT'S ON FALL THEY ASSUME THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION HERE TODAY IT IS TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. THE DIMENSIONS WATER THE APPROPRIATE THINGS DUE TO RESPOND. NOW WE'VE BEEN PRETTY AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF BOTH. LOOKING AT WHAT WE DO TO MITIGATE THE RISK BY IMPROVING OF FIRE PREVENTION. SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THESE KINDS OF CATASTROPHES. OUR. NOT SURE THAT THE ONLY KATANA KIND CATASTROPHE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE GET MORE SEVERE AND MORE FREQUENT IS FIRE. HOME YOU KNOW TODAY CLEARLY IS NOT A FIRE RISK DAY IF ANYBODY CAME OUTSIDE THAT WE HAVE UNSEASONABLE HAIL STORM HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE SOME MUD SLIDES IN THE COASTAL RANGE THAT HAS IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I I'M I YOU KNOW I SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND NEED TO HAPPEN WERE WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WITH THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. I WILL SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED RULES THAT MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR US TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT THESE THINGS TO HAVE BOTH HERE THEIR IDEAS OR TO TELL THEM WHAT WE'RE DOING. WHAT THEY ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE INTERESTED PARTIES ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE WITH THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS APPEAL? IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN EX PARTE COMMUNICATION WHICH IS REPORTED WE ACTUALLY HAD ONE. INVESTOR GROUP WHO TALKING TO A STAFF PERSON ACTUALLY BREACHED EX PARTY WE HAD TO THEN FILE AN EX PARTY NOTICE ON OUR SIDE WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY PUT TO US. AND WHEN THEY DIDN'T IN FACT MEET THE DEADLINE AND DO THEIR OWN. FILING FOR EX PARTY WE REFERRED IT TO THE AJ THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO THE P. YOU SEE BEING A BODY THAT THE THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY IS GOING TO LEAD TO. THAT IS PROBABLY SOME OF THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OF AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN WISH THAT AWAY THAT IS YOUR DIRECTION TO US AND WE'RE TRYING TO SCRUPULOUSLY OBSERVED. I HAVE GOT I NEED TO PROCEED I. GIVE HIM ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES THREE MINUTES. I HAVE THREE FOUR FOUR MASSIVE QUESTION BUT I WANT A COMPLETE COMPLETE YES TO GET. WE HAVE TO LOOK I THINK WE HAVE GOT THE LATEST STANDARD DOWN HERE. WHAT WE WE ARE TALKING DO YOU CONSIDER A CRISIS IMMINENT OR NOT? PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE PRESIDENT BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO GATHER INFORMATION WILL HAVE A OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHERS FROM THE AUDIENCE TO. ASK QUESTIONS AND SUPPOSED STATEMENTS ARE WITHIN A LIMITED TIME FRAME. BUT. WE ARE AS A COMMITTEE. AS I SAID EARLIER ON TRYING TO TAKE THIS ISSUE AS IT HAS THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE UTILITY AND ENERGY A SECTOR AND. IT IS NOW CLEARLY A MAJOR ISSUE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE YOU DON'T STEP TOO FAR LAST AND THAT I I I I WILL BUT I'LL DEFER TO THE. ADVICE OF THE CHAIR. WE HANDLE THOUGH CRISES DIFFERENT THAN WE DO CIRCUMSTANCESFOR WHICH WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A CRISIS. I THINK WE ARE HEADED TOWARD AN ENERGY. A CRISIS THAT IS THAT IS MADE BY THE SET. OF FAX AND I UNDERSTAND THE INVERSE A CONDEMNATION AND ALL OF THAT AND WHO WHO IS TO BLAME AND WHO'S GOING TO PAY. IS I WANT TO EXPLORE WHETHER THERE IS ARE LEGITIMATE SHARED RISK AND LIABILITY FACTORS HERE. DON'T THE OTHER PLAYERS. IN ALL OF THIS HAVE CERTAIN INCLUDING OF THE P. UC. CALIFORNIA OTHERS. TO. DO BEST PRACTICES TO SHOW UP ARE ON TIME. VERY QUICKLY I'LL USE FOR EXAMPLE ARE PENALIZED EVEN IF THEY HAVE. GOOD INTENTION BUT THE P. YOU SEE CONCLUDES THAT THEY DIDN'T ARRIVE IN A TIMELY MANNER IN A FIRE. DO WE NOT QUESTION WHETHER CAL FIRE ARRIVES IN A. TIMELY FASHION DO WE NOT ASK WHETHER. A THE FOREST MANAGEMENT. WHETHER IT'S A. THE STATE FOREST FEDERAL FOREST WE HAVE. ALL FALLEN TREES AND CUT DOWN TREES AT ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS. GROWING FUEL FOR THESE. TOM EXPLOSIONS. UP. IS WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE ARE WAYS IS THAT LITIGATION IS A THROUGH THE COURTS AS IT THROUGH LEGISLATION. WHERE? IT YOU CAN LEGITIMATELY EXPLORE. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OTHER. PLAYERS IN THIS. HAVE SOME DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY. IN THE RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR FIRE INCIDENT. SO LAST FALL COMMISSIONER GUZMANIA SERVICE AND I. CEFIC COOLEY RAISE THAT ISSUE AND WALK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR SUMMIT ATTENTION TO THIS QUESTION EVENT FIRST CONDEMNATION. AND FRANKLY ARE WE APPEAL TO YOU TO GIVE US DIRECTION ON THIS QUESTION OF PRUDENT SEE VERSUS A DIFFERENT TESTS SUCH AS REASONABLENESS. SO THAT IN OUR LITIGATED PROCESSES WE HAVE THAT KINDS OF OF OF TOOLS ALLOWS TO BE NUANCED IN JUST THOSE WAYS THAT YOU SUGGESTED. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLS HERE. OUT THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS AND WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM THE? LEGISLATURE AND AM AND I'M I'M GONNA END THIS CRAP HERE. OP I THINK WE ARE IN A CRISIS I THINK THAT TO HANDLE THIS AS JUST A NORMAL ROUTINE AND WAIT FOR ALL THE TIME GO BY AND ALL THAT LITIGATION I THINK WE HAVE A. CRISIS ON OUR HANDS IS GOING TO REQUIRE. A YOU TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY US TO START THINKING DIFFERENTLY AND FOR US TO START ENGAGING IN A. IN A WITH THEM LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANTS AS YOU HAVE SUGGESTED WITH RESPECT TO PRUDENCE PURSES REASONABLE SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'VE TAKEN. SOME GOOD NOTES IN THE NEXT TIME I THINK WE. I ENGAGE IN THIS AYE I REALLY WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE. A MENU OF SOLUTIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO. UP IT ARAB. ENGAGE IN NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE POLITICAL. PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS DEBATE UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS IS AND THAT IN FACT THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES. THE RECOVERABILITY ISSUES THE LIABILITY ISSUES THE INSURANCE ISSUES THAT. CREDIT RATING ISSUES WOULD SERIOUSLY BE ADDRESSED AND CONSIDERED AS WE GO ALONG FAILURE TO DO THAT IS GOING WE'RE GONNA BE AROUND HERE. WHEN WE GOT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE. BUT. ELECTRICITY. I YOU I USE PROVIDING TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF POPULATION STATE CALIFORNIA EVER GOING TO END UP I THINK WAS SERIOUS BANKRUPTCY ISSUE I REALLY THINK THIS IS. THE CRISIS AND REALLY NEEDS SORT OF A CRISIS APPROACH TO IT. AND I THINK THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE SAYING WE WOULD REALLY NEED TO HAVE THE P. YOU SEE BE THINKING IN TERMS OF CRISIS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING. THAT THIS IS A CRISIS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD CONSIDER CRISIS IS WELL. LIKE I SAID I THINK YOU MIGHT WANNA KEEP SOME OF THE LAWYERS WILL SEND OVER FOR AWHILE TO GET TO GET THE BEST. OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE OUT THAT I KNOW WHAT I WOULD ALSO TO MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THAT WE SHOULD ENGAGE OUR OUR LAWYERS THAT. THE LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE. LEGISLATURE TO BE IN THAT ROOM AND TO HEAR THOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND TO ADVISE OFFICE. AS YOUR LAWYERS ADVISE YOU ARE. BUT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO ENGAGE SERIOUSLY ON THIS AND SOON. I THEY WERE ENGAGING IN I'M SORRY SERIOUS I KNOW WE ALL ARE. COME BACK TOMORROW MISTER MAYES. I'D DIED. JUST WANNA DIE THANK YOU FOR COMING AND. HAVING THIS THIS CONVERSATION I'VE READ SOME OF THESE REPORTS ON FROM WALL STREET AND I. KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING. US RIGHT NOW. AND I'M SURE THERE THE WATCHING WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THERE WATCHING THE WORDS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF. OUR MOUTH AND I'M I THINK THAT THAT THAT SOME OF THE STUFF I'VE READ HERE SEAT IN THIS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER WHERE THERE'S AN URGENCY. ON OUR PART TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE'S URGENCY. OUT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY I THINK I'VE HEARD FROM THE VICE CHAIR IN THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD THAT THERE'S URGENCY. THAT TO BE ABLE TO TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM I ALSO KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN. THAT ELECTED OFFICIAL NAM FOR I DON'T KNOW A LONG TIME IT SEEMS LIKE A SIXTEEN YEARS OR SOMETHING THAT FIFTEEN YEARS. AND IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO LIKE TO BLAME IT ON OTHER PEOPLE NAM BE INSTEAD OF I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. AND WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE BLAME THE COUNTY WE BLAME THE STATE OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR. A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND THEN WE BLAME THE CITIES AND THE STATE AND THEN I GOT HERE THE STATE WE STARTED BLAMING CITIES AND AND AND COUNTIES. THAT BUT THE REALITY IS THE CPU SEE YOU GUYS SERVE THE PUBLIC JUST LIKE WE SERVE THE PUBLIC IN AS THE VICE CHAIR SAID THERE SEVENTY PERCENT. OF THE OF THE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS AND YOU ALSO. THAT CHAIRMAN ALSO TO GIVE A VERY. CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WE HAVE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE STATE IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE A FINANCIALLY FINANCIALLY SOUNDS WITH BE VERY CAREFUL. OF OUR LANGUAGE IN THE WORDS THAT WE ARE WITH THE WE ARE SAYING. AND SO THAT THE ONE QUESTION THAT I THAT I HAVE IS DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A PARTNER A WITH THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY BACK ON US. WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE KNOW THAT THERE SOME LEGAL IMPLICATIONS WE KNOW WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE IS BUT LOOK I'VE GOT THREE ACA'S I THINK I'VE INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND DOWN. IN EVERY OUT THERE GONNA GET THROUGH BUT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY IS LEGISLATORS TO BE ABLE TO TO TO FIX IT SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT A PARTNER AND IF YOU. IF IF YOU DON'T THEN LET'S LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIGURE THAT OUT. I AM FEELING MUCH CLEARER THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ENGAGED IN THIS I I I I I WENT THROUGH A LONG FALLOW PERIOD AFTER MY KNEE SURGERY SITTING AROUND AND FRETTING ABOUT THIS AND NOT. NOT HAVING COMMUNICATIONS WITH MEMBERS NOW THAT I'VE HAD SOME TIME TO GET OUT AND TO TALK TO YOU AND PARTICULARLY HERE TODAY. I SEE THAT YOU'RE VERY STE MOTIVATED YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE CAN DO. HERE EXPLORING THE THE NECESSITY OF YOUR OWN ACTION. HIGH A SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO SHARPEN I KNOW THAT I SAW THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IS LOOKING AT THAT SAME STANDARD AND POOR'S REPORT THAT I GOT TODAY. THEY DOWNGRADED THE CREDIT ON A SOLAR FACILITY IT'S A LARGE FULLER SOLAR FACILITY ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE STATE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEGAWATTS. AND NON AND. ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BACKYARD. AND THEY DID IT BECAUSE THE CAT AND THE THE THE RATING AGENCIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CASH FLOW FROM THE UTILITY. PAY FOR THAT ELECTRICITY. THIS DID THIS IS WHAT IS BEHIND OUR SUCCESS IN TERMS OF RENEWABLES THE UTILITIES ARE BIG SPEED REALLY QUICKLY THEY GET CHEAP MONEY TO DO IT THEY ACT THEY CAN SCALE. AND IF IN FACT WE'RE SEEING THIS KIND OF REACTION FROM CAPITAL MARKETS TO A SOLAR FACILITY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PRODUCING ELECTRICITY RELIABLY FOR PROBABLY SIX YEARS. A PROJECT I WORKED ON A LOT WHEN IT WAS A CITING PERMITTING INTERCONNECTING LARGE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE PIECES INFRASTRUCTURE THAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT SO GOOD PROVIDES GOOD THINGS FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WORRY ABOUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IF THIS THIS THIS FINANCING MECHANISM IS STARTS TO FRAY. I THINK THAT THAT'S EQUALLY TRUE OF OUR AB OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO TO DRIVE. TO MARKET SCALE AND TO COST EFFECTIVENESS BATTERY STORAGE BATTERY STORAGE PRICES HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN. LARGELY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST INVESTORS YES REPAIR COST FOR BEING EARLY. ON IN THIS PROCESS BUT WITH THE BENEFIT IS THAT WE'VE CREATED A LOT OF DEVELOPERS WHO ACTUALLY CAN DELIVER. CHEAP RENEWABLE SOON WILL HAVE DEVELOPED WHICH CAN DELIVER CHEAP BATTERIES. AND I THINK THAT I ALSO FEAR THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE EROSION OF CONFIDENCE IN INVESTORS THAT WE MAY FIND IT HARD TO FINANCE ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THESE ARE ALL THE REASONS THAT I FOCUS ON THE UTILITY IS NOT FOR THE UTILITY SAKE ALONE. BECAUSE IT BRINGS ME BACK TO ALL THOSE INANIMATE OBJECTS THAT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE THE VOICE FOR. I THINK NOT TO I THINK REPEAT WILL MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO IN PALM DESERT IS SAD. WE WE KNOW WE ARE AT A CRISIS LEVEL AND WE VERY MUCH TO WANT TO. PARTNER. I'D. JUST LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. MY COLLECTION PALM DESERT'S COMMENTS THAT LOOK MEET ITS. NO ONE WINS IN THIS BLAME GAME THE END OF THE DAY IS. WE AS A STATE NEED TO HAVE. RELIABLE RECENTLY PRICE ELECTRICITY. TO OUR. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO THE POPULATION TO OUR BUSINESSES THAT'S. HARM SOMETHING THAT IS PARAMOUNT FOR OUR ECONOMY MANY OTHER THINGS. THE YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT WE'RE EVEN SOMEWHAT INSULARITY SECONDARY TO THAT TERMS OF CLEAN ENERGY ELECTRIC VEHICLES THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'VEBEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE AND. WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BILL THOSE INDUSTRIES THEY'VE CREATED JOBS AND. YOU KNOW THEY'VE CREATED JOBS ALL OF THE STATE THEY'VE BEEN A HUGE ECONOMIC INDICATORS ARM. WELL WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR US PRESIDENT JUST REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND NEXT UP SOME DIMENSION LIKE OFFICE THAT WE NEED TO GET. CAN ARE LAWYERS THE CHAIR THE VICE CHAIR WE CAN WE CAN ALL GET TOGETHER IN A ROOM. TRY TO HASH. THIS OUT BUT I THINK IT'S. I'M. VERY IMPERATIVE THAT WE. MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT. IT IS OUR JOB AS A STATE. TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO. PROCURE ELECTRICITY DELIVER HIGH TRICITY. GET ELECTRICITY WE WE CAN'T GO. A FEW HOURS OF ELECTRICITY FROM ECONOMIC POINT OF YOU MEAN. WHEN INNOVATION ECONOMY IF THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW ENTERTAIN INDUSTRY THERE HAVE ELECTRICITY GET YES WHERE THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO JOB THERE'S NOBODY GOING TO WORK SO. ON. YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK WE ARE DEATHLY AT. HOME. AT A VERY. RISKY POINT NOT JUST FROM A INTO UTILITY INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S. THAT THAT SECRETARY I THINK IT'S REALLY THE FOUNDATION OF THE ECONOMY FOR OUR STATE IS HAS VERY MUCH I RECITE YES. WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE CONTINUE TO GATHER DO ABOUT US NOTHING BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WHAT CAN WE ALL DO ABOUT IT'S I THINK? YOU NO IT'S CAN AFFECT THE BAY AREA THE SAME WAY AFFECT THE PALM DESERT OR FRESNO OR LA IT'S HOGAN AFFECT US. WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU I MIGHT SENSE IS THAT TO THE TO THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND TO GIVE THEM ASSURANCES THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION HAVE BEEN FOND FLAT. THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT ARE THE ACTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO TAKEAND SO I'M HEARTENED TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR RESOLVE AND AGAIN I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO TO WORKING WITH YOU. SNOT THERE'S THERE'S A RANGE DIFFERENT THINGS TO CONSIDER AND DID SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO TO THINK THROUGH. BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AND ARE HELPFUL GET THEIR. WELL I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF I WAS LOOKING AT FROM THE INVESTOR SIDE MEAN THEIR. APOLOGISTS ASSUMING THERE'S GONNA BE. YOU KNOW. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS COMING. THAT ARE GOING THERE ARE YOU THERE THEY WORRY THERE RIGHT SO LONG. BEGINNING HER YOU KNOW. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OF LIABILITIES I THINK. WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS? THAT ISSUE I THINK MANAGE THAT ISSUED THE END OF THE DAY IS. HARM. ELECTRICITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S A LUXURY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON INDIVIDUALLY AS. AT A CITIZENS AND AYE ECONOMICALLY AS A STATE. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE WE NEED I THINK YOU ARE YOUR HELP AS WELL IN YOUR GUIDANCE TO. THE FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PAN OUT. IN I DON'T COME BACK TOMORROW OKAY THANK YOU WAS BURKE. HOW YOU DOING? AYE. AYE PHILIP THERE EITHER URGENCY OR THERE ISN'T. AND. THE FACT THAT WERE COMING BACK LIVE ATTORNEYS AREN'T THEY'RE HERE TO PRESENT AS SOME OF WHAT THE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE I THINK IT'S SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION YOU MAY BE HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS THAT. YOU KNOW INVESTORS ARE WAITING INSURANCE IS GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE NO MATTER WHAT OUR REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE HIT. AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S NOTHING WORSE FOR INVESTORS TO HEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD TO ANOTHER HEARING TO ANOTHER HEARING TO ANOTHER HEARING I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ARE MOST AFRAID OF. AND I THINK THAT I'M HOPING THAT THE CHAIR AND THAT YOU HOPEFULLY IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WILL SIT DOWN WITH YOUR ATTORNEYS AND HOPEFULLY WE ALL GET TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD RATHER MOVE QUICKER THAN SLOWER. I THINK THAT WE HAVE A VERY BAD REPUTATION WHETHER IT'S WITH INVESTORS ARE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE TAKE TOO LONG WE TAKE FOR EVER AND HERE WE NOW FIND OURSELVES AT YES BUT I WOULD CONSIDER CRISIS. SO I DON'T PUT THE BLAME ON YOU THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ONLY LOOK AT SHARED RISK IRAQ RELIABILITY I THINK SOME OF THEIR ABOUT RELIABILITY IN THE RISK HAS BEEN OUR OWN FAULT. SOME OF THE REASON THESE FIRES HAVE BEEN SO BAD. ARE BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT DONE OUR FAIR SHARE. HOWEVER. LIKE I THINK I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE BLAME GAME IS OVER AND RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO MOVE. AND SO I IMPLORE YOU AND YOUR ATTORNEYS IF WE HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING THAT IT SOON. THAT WHAT WHEN THEY COME HERE THEY COME HERE WITH SOLUTIONS AND THEN WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I WHEN WE COME BACK HERE WE COME BACK WITH SOME SOLUTIONS OF OUR OWN. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MOVE THE BAR FORWARD ON THIS BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE CAN CALL THE CRISIS ALL DAY LONG. AND WE CAN BE UPSET ABOUT IT ALL DAY LONG BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY INVESTORS MOVE QUICKLY. THEY MOVE OUT OF THINGS QUICKLY THE MOVE INTO THINGS QUICKLY AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE US GET ANY IN TO ANY MORE DAMAGE THAN WE HAVE WE HAVE PUT OURSELVES IN. WELL I THINK YOU YOU SEE THERE'S A CONSENSUS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN WANTING TO. A MOVE FORWARD. I THINK IT ALSO IS IMPORTANT A NO SO THAT THIS IS ONE OF MANY COMMITTEES WITHIN THIS INSTITUTION THAT HAS A PIECE OF THIS. ISSUE YOU HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES YOU HAVE JUDICIARY YOU HAVE. A NUMBER. INSURANCE. ARE ALL OF THESE COMMITTEES TOUCH ON THIS ISSUE. ARE WE ARE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TODAY OUR COMMITMENT ARE AS IT RELATES TO THE UTILITY AND ENERGY SECTOR. THAT WE ARE ALL IN AND TRYING TO HELP FIND A SOLUTION. BUT IT IS A GOD TO BE A COORDINATED ONE BECAUSE THERE'S A HOLISTIC SOLUTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND IT'S NOT GONNA FALL JUST SIMPLY ON THIS COMMITTEE. BUT WE ARE HERE TO START THE PROCESS AND TO ENGAGE ON THE ISSUE. A BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALSO. WEAVING AND INSURANCE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS NOT JUST BRING AN ATTORNEY AND TO THIS. ROOM OR IN A BACK ROOM AND. US FIGURE IT OUT OF THERE IT CROSSES OVER TO MANY OTHER LINES IN JURISDICTIONS AND THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION IS VERY CLEAR. AND DEFINED STATUTES SO. I WILL SAY THAT. WE ARE HAPPY TO. WITHIN THE CONTEXT IN THE CONTOUR THIS COMMITTEE HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION IN AREAS WHERE WE CAN GET. SOME LEGAL. DIRECTION AND ALSO TO REALLY BE IN A POSITION TO BRING THAT OUT INTO A PUBLIC CONVERSATION I'M JUST NOT SURE AT THIS POINT WHAT ALL OF THE. RAMIFICATIONS WILL BE. AND. AS WAS POINTED OUT. A WHAT IS SAID FROM THIS. DIES. HAS TREMENDOUS IMPACT. AND WE WANNA BE THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT WHAT WE SAY WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT WHAT WE SAY. IF SOMEONE TAKES ANYTHING OF WHAT SAID HERE TODAY OUT OF ANY KIND OF CONTACTS. IT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE MARKETS. WE'RE COGNIZANT OF THAT. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID VERY CLEARLY TODAY. BUT WE CAN'T BE SO. EAGER. TO JUMP OUT THERE WITH THAT WE. I HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE BY ANY OF OUR ACTIONS. AND WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED RIGHTFULLY SO ABOUT REPAIRS BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT AND. INVESTORS BUT WERE. VARYING CONCERNED ABOUT RATE PAYERS. BECAUSE WHATEVER COMES OUT AS A SOLUTION IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS. YOU MAY SOLVE A INVESTOR PROBLEM AND CREATE. A REPAIR PROBLEM. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY DELIBERATE. WE'RE GONNA BE VERY CLEAR AND THOROUGH. SO WHEN WE SPEAK IN WILL HAVE. WE'LL FIGURE OUT A PROCESS OF WHAT SOLUTIONS LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOLISTIC SOLUTIONS THAT ARE ALSO GOING TO. INVOLVE THE INSURANCE. A COMMITTEE. NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. AND MANY OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL SO WITH THAT LET ME JUST. TURN TWO OF THE PUBLIC EYE WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO HEAR FROM YOU IF THERE ARE ANY. SPEAKERS ARE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS WITH THE QUESTION OR STATEMENT. TAKE A MINUTE TO DO SO AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY SPAWNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SCOTT WHICH IN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. I REPRESENT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GO OUT AND RISK THEIR LIVES IN WEATHER LIKE WE HAVE TODAY. TO KEEP THE SYSTEM RUNNING. I FEEL MISTER CHAIRMAN LIKE I'VE STEPPED INTO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE THE PRESENTATION BY THE PRESIDENT. AND HIS STAFF. ABOUT HOW THE COMMISSION PLACES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON SAFETY. DOES NOT RESEMBLE ANYTHING THAT WE WITNESSES AT THE ACTUAL PROCEEDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WOULD SUBMIT TO THE TO THIS COMMITTEE THE IF YOU APPLIED PRUDENT CARE TEST. TO THE ACTIONS OF THE COMMISSION OVER THE LAST DECADE YOU'D FIND THEM. A LIABLE OF FOR THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE COMMISSION'S SPENDS LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR TIME. PROBABLY CLOSER TO TWO PERCENT OF THEIR TIME WHEN REVIEWING IT GENERAL RATE CASE IN DECIDING HOW MUCH. MONEY AND RESOURCES. PLACE INTO INVESTING INTO THE SYSTEM. OR GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IN THE LAST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CASE. WE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION DATA THAT SHOWED AND DEMONSTRATED THE NEEDS REPLACE BRITTLE AND DANGEROUS POLLS. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS SET ASIDE BY THE COMMISSION. WOULD HAVE ALLOWED OF EDISON TO REPLACE THEIR BRITTLE POLLS WERE ACTUALLY ALL OF THEIR POLLS IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS. I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS A POLL YET THAT LASTS TWO HUNDRED YEARS. THEY BECOME SO ENAMORED WITH SHINING. SHINY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS. BUT THERE COR. FOCUS ON SAFETY. HAS BEEN LOST. TWO GRAY IN TAKE AWAYS FROM MY CLIENTS TODAY IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS COMMITMENT TO SAFETY ANY SUPPORTED SOME REALLY CAPABLE PERSON HAD THE DEPARTMENT. OUR CONFIDENCE. IT'S SORT. I'LL GIVE YOU FEW EXAMPLES. THERE IS NO THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS THE P. YOU SEE IS. WHEN THEY INVENT WHEN THEY. DIRECT AM I YOU TO PUT MONEY INTO MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM. REPLACING FAULTY TRANSFORMERS ARE READY TO EXPLODE REPLACING BRITTLE POLLS. THEY NEVER GO BACK AND REQUIRE THE UTILITY TO COME BACK AND DEMONSTRATED WAS ACTUALLY SPENT THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SPENT. NOW I THINK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN RAISED TO EXTENT. GOING FORWARD. STARTING WITH THE SEPARATE CASE IN THREE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL FIND OUT IF THEY SPENT THE MONEY IN THIS LAST RATE CASE. THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SPENT. AND I'M I'M SORRY I I THINK KIND IF DID MENTION OF WE HAVE A MINUTE TO EITHER MAKE THEM OUT ALRIGHT WATCHES OR CHAIR OF THE STATE. IF I WOULD ASK THE. COMMISSION HELMI ON BUNKS IN THE LAST DECADE A DECADE HAVE YOU HAD ONE ON FIRE SAFETY AND SAFE OR SAFETY OF THE SYSTEM BEFORE THESE FIRES. IN ROUND NUMBERS I THINK THAT WOULD BE ZERO. THE WAY THAT THAT THE MISTER CHAIRMAN THE FOR THE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WHEN REEF WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS THE P. UC. ONE. EXPENSIVE THINGS LIKE NET METERING OR HOW MUCH WE'RE GOOD INVEST IN FUEL CELLS. THERE'S NO PRIORITIZATION IS NO SUSPENSE FILE IF YOU WILL AT THE P. YOU SEE SO I DON'T THINK WITH THIS MONEY BE BETTER SPENT. INSURING THE SAFETY OF THE SYSTEM. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE'RE GONNA BE SUBMITTING TO THE COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS A LIST OF ALL THE FILINGS THAT WE'VE MADE. WITH DOLLARS AND DOCUMENTATIONS OF THE AMOUNT OF SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS WAS DEATH WE'VE ASKED THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT OVER THE LAST DECADE. AND HOW MUCH THEY ACTUALLY FUNDED FOR THOSE. ACTIVITIES THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE TAKE OF THEM. MOST WAS SO FIRM I WILL SAY THAT NOT ONLY DID WE HAVE A ON BOND SIMPLY TO LOOK AT WHEN POLLS AND THEIR SAFETY RISK IN THEIR CARE AND FEEDING WE PUBLISHED A BOOKLET. CALLED THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE WOODEN POLE ALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I TOURED. NOT ONE BUT TWO DIFFERENT SITES OF DISASTERS THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURE WOODEN POLES. HAD NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH AYE BE LITTLE W. LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE STAFF ABOUT THE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE SAFETY. TALK TO UTILITY ENGINEERS. THAT WE HAD A ARE ALL PARTY TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE EXPENDITURES THAT U. S. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WAS MAKING IN THAT CASE THE. THAT. ARM. MISTURA ON SORRY. BECAUSE MR WHICH WAS SPEAKING ABOUT. AND. OUR CHALLENGES AGAIN THERE WE'RE BOUND BY THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE RECORD AND SO OTHER COMMISSIONERS FOUND A OTHER ARGUMENTS VERY COMPELLING I DON'T THINK WE AGREED WITH. WITH Q. ON THEIR ARGUMENTS I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY I WILL NOTE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A BACKLOG IS THAT IN THE DOWN ECONOMY OF TWO THOUSAND THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF UTILITIES. AND OF P. YOU SEE COMMISSIONERS TO VOTE FOR RATE INCREASES TO REPLACE WOODEN POLES I DISAGREE WITH THAT WERE MOVING MORE QUICKLY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE ALL FOUR POINT TWO MILLION POLES. IN A TIME CERTAIN. I THINK WE ARE SEEKING TO PRIORITIZE THEM WERE SEEKING TO GET BETTER INFORMATION ON WHAT THE TRUE LIFE OF A POLL IS THEIR OPINION RANGE FROM SEVENTY YEARS DOWN TO FORTY YEARS. KNOWING COOPER COULD REALLY GIVE A STRONG EVIDENCE EXCEPT THE AVERAGE SO I THINK. WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH IT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR SEA URCHIN ANSWER IN A LITIGATED DUH SETTING TO THAT KIND OF A QUESTION BUT I DO FEEL LIKE WE SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS. I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE A COPY OF OUR NATURAL HISTORY OF WOODEN POLES. CORPORATE  THAT. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE SO I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO. I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE US PUBLIC INPUT. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE ALL TURN TO OF OTHER MEMBERS MISTER. CUNNINGHAM YOU'VE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SO RECOGNIZE YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND. I WAS GOING TO ASK WHETHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF THESE ISSUES ON. PLACES LIKE TOPAZ SOLAR FARM. BUT FROM YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S ON YOUR RADAR. WELL YEAH I THINK IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKET IS A LINKAGE BETWEEN. VIEWS OF I OR USE AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE AND RELY ON I USE FOR PURCHASE. CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE BEING PULLED. WHATEVER MOVEMENT. IS HAPPENING WITH I USE ITS POLLING A LOT OF OTHER. MOONS INTO THE ORBIT. SO TO SPEAK AND. I THINK THAT RAISES BIG. ISSUES PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT THE. THE GOALS WE HAVE SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA LAW. A FOREIGN HAVE RENEWABLE. TARGETS AND REPLACEMENT OF THE LOST ENERGY PRODUCTION WENDY ABLE CAN IT CLOSES. WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW IS IN MY DISTRICT. SO JUST ANY AGAINST MY QUESTION WOULD BE. WHAT AREAS BESIDES SO WHERE ARE WE SEEING THESE EFFECTS IN OUR? ARE. ARE YOU IS THERE ANYTHING CONCRETE THAT YOU NEED US TO DO. AT SOME POINT IN TIME. TO HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. I THINK THIS CONTINUING DIALOGUE AS TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS TO BE THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THEY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PUBLICLY THEIR OVERALL CONCERN. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SPEAK TO THE ANXIETY OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS BUT I THINK THEY WANT TO SEE THAT ACTIONS THE STATE IS ACTUALLY CONSIDERING. SINCE NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE WITHIN THE CPU SEIZE CONTROL I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW UP. ON WITH EXACTLY WHAT THE CHAIRS TALKING ABOUT WITCHES SO I'M SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT FEASIBLE WE CAN BE DONE. I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO SERVE UP THINGS THAT LOOK GOOD. BUT WHICH THEY DON'T THINK ARE LIKELY TO ACTUALLY BEAR OUT OVERTIME THEY WANT. THEY WANT SOME FAIRLY CALM CLEAR. EFFECTIVE. IDEAS PUT ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT WILL WILL RESTORE THEIR CONFIDENCE AND BOTH OF THE THE THE HIGHEST POLICYMAKERS IN THE STATE. AND THEN THE AGENCY THAT EFFECTUATE YOUR POLICY THE CPU SAY. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR COMING OUT TODAY AND AS I SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING THIS IS NOT THE FIRST IN THE END OF OUR CONVERSATION IS NOT DESIGNED TO JUST HAVE A. A MEANDERING SERIES OF MEETINGS IT IS TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN. BE IN A POSITION TO GIVE WHAT YOU VAST FOR THE VERY BEGINNING A SOME DIRECTION. I KNOW THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT PIECES THEIR TO THE KIND OF DIRECTION THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO GIVE AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE. A MINUTE JUST TO COORDINATE. HIS AS I SAY THIS IS NOT THE ONLY COMMITTEE THAT HAS SOME DEGREE OF JURISDICTION OVER THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND DO THE FAIR THING AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT NOT ONLY FOR INVESTORS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES POOR FOR THE RATE PAYERS IN THE STATE. WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND AND SO GATHERING INFORMATION. AND INVADING IN A BETTER POSITION TO THEN. BE RESPONSIVE IS OUR GOAL SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR COMING OUT TODAY WE WILL ALL RESPECT OUT TO ENSURE TERM APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COME BACK EVEN TOMORROW. TO MEET WITH US. THIS INFORMATIONAL UNLESS THERE'S A CLOSING ANYTIME AFTER I'VE HAD MY SECOND CUP OF COFFEE YOU GOT IT. THIS INFORMATION OR HEARING IS ADJOURNED
