LAST SHOW YOU SEEN I THINK

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.123
BECAUSE THE POLARIZATION WHERE

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.493
POLITICS IS THE EXPLOITATION OF

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.994
A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT DATE

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.130

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.110
ARE SCARED TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT-

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:27.245

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.884

TRANSPARENCY'S IMPORTANT. TO MR

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.070
BALOCH POINT I THINK TEN YEARS

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:53.971
AGO YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.139
THAT THIS WAS. ONEROUS I THINK

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:56.474
TODAY ALL THE TOOLS ARE.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.042
THOROUGHLY IN PLACE SETTING WITH

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.711
SOME THOUGHTFUL. IMPLEMENTATION

00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:02.313
IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT ARE ALIGNED

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.147

THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL AND I

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.786

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:15.626
CONSIDERATION ABOUT UNITY

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.595
PROVISIONS FOR CURE- MAYBE A

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:20.031

THE INCENTIVES TO REPORT THEIR

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.440
OF THE OBLIGATION REPORT I THINK

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.842
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT THE

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:32.710

THOSE SYSTEMS SHOULDN'T BE TOO

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:40.017
HARD TO INTEGRATE WITH THESE

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.119

YOUR BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN. IS I

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.948
WAS TRYING TO SEE WHAT PROBLEM

ARE WE SOLVING WHAT WHAT PROBLEM

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.919

DEFINITION IN YOUR BILL- YOU BY

NOT IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM UNTIL

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.458
AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT'S

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.326
HAPPENED. AT THREE MONTHS PRIOR

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.795
TO THE ELECTION AND IS A

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:26.864
CONTRIBUTION LOWER THAN FIVE

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:30.935
THOUSAND BUT ABOVE- A THOUSAND.

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.937
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:34.705
SPEAK TO ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:35.440
THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:37.208
ELECTION CYCLE GOING BACK TWO

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.676
DECADES THAT WE'VE HAD IT. AND

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.077
WE HAD THESE DISCLOSURES WHERE

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.779
YOU FEEL THERE'S BEEN AN ABUSE

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:43.548
THAT IN A MINUTE ELATION AS

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:44.382
OCCURRED. WHERE SOMEONE HAS

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.951
RECEIVED CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:48.319
OF THE FAILURE TO DISCLOSE

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.788
MONTHS AND MONTHS BEFORE THE A

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.490
LOT. OF VOTERS HAVE BEEN ILL

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.625
SERVED. WELL I DON'T THINK

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:56.894
THERE'S BEEN ABUSE BUT I DO

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:57.962
THINK THAT THE VOTERS BEEN ILL

00:34:58.029 --> 00:35:00.298
SERVED AND SO I WE YOU AND I

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:02.834
SPOKE ABOUT HOW THERE ARE THESE-

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.268
THE PAPER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:07.171
OF THE AND SO LITTLE EARLY IN

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.307
THE CAMPAIGN SO DO YOU HAVE SO

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:10.975
THAT TAKES SO MUCH TIME TO FIND

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.977
OUT BASICS ABOUT A CAMPAIGN

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:16.080
FINANCE- YOU KNOW IN AN EARLIER

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:17.415
STAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN SO ALL

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:20.017
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS HAVE

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:20.651
SOME MORE TIMELY REPORTING AND

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:22.553
DISCLOSURE. BUT THINGS LIKE THE

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.921
FIVE TO TEN DAYS NO PROBLEM I

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:25.056
MEAN THAT THAT FROM MY

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:26.958
PERSPECTIVE THAT'S IT THAT'S IT

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.626
THAT'S NOT A MEANINGFUL AT THE

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:30.161
CONCESSION FROM UP TRANSPARENCY

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:31.963
PERSPECTIVE BUT IT MAKES A BIG

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.431
DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.032
GOTCHA GAME THAT THAT THE

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:36.434
SENATOR WAS TALKING ABOUT SO

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.368
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I'M SO

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.538
HAPPY TO- TO BE FLEXIBLE ON BUT

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:42.673
THE BUT THE BROAD CONCEPT OF.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.308
GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE-

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:45.743
SHINING A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.513
ON ON A ON A CAMPAIGN FINANCING-

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:49.981
AT THE EARLIER STAGE SO YOU

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.182
DON'T HAVE TO WAIT LITTLE MONTHS

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:52.950
UNTIL THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT TO

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:54.118
KNOW WHAT THE BASICS ARE OF

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.887
SOMEONE ELSE'S CAMPAIGN IS WHAT

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.589
I'M TRYING TO GET OUT HERE THAT

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:00.424
IT- SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:02.093
IT'S HARD TO SEE A CONTRIBUTION

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:04.262
GIVEN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS BEFORE

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.998
THE ELECTION. AND THAT THAT THE

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.666
FACT THAT IT'S NOT DISCLOSE FOR

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.468
OF A NUMBER OF MONTHS AS A

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.702
MATERIAL AFFECT AN ELECTION

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.070
BECAUSE IT'S NOT HAPPENING FOR

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.273
ONE OR TWO YEARS LATER SO FOR

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.841
EXAMPLE IN OUR CURRENT ELECTION

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:18.876
YEAR TWENTY TWO CONTRIBUTIONS

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.745
THAT WERE GIVEN IN TWENTY OR

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:22.780
TWENTY ONE- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.682
SEMIANNUAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:27.952
PRIOR TO THAT POINT IN TIME. AND

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:28.886
THERE'S DISCLOSURE MONTHS AND

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:30.555
MONTHS BEFORE AN ELECTION WHERE

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.290
IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO FELT THAT

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.958
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE- THAT

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.760
THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THERE

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.695
WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY ONCE IN

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:43.200
MONTHS OF OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. A

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.835
ISSUE OF IF YOU DECIDED TO DO

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.804
IT- SO I DON'T REALLY SEE WHERE

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:47.872
WE'RE CLOSING ANY KIND OF

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.707
TRANCE. GAP IN THE PRIOR

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:50.241
ELECTION YEAR BEFORE THE

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:51.275
ELECTION. NOW NEVERTHELESS I DO

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.743
HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.011
TO PUT FORWARD. I THINK WHERE

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.314
THERE IS A GAP IN OUR DISCLOSURE

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.381
HAPPENS DURING THE ELECTION

00:36:57.448 --> 00:37:00.585
YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE A

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:03.721
CANDIDATE- THAT AT THAT- THAT-

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.523
WITH THE DECLARED IN JANUARY OF

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.491
THIS YEAR OR YOU'RE AN ACTIVE

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.660
CANDIDATE. BUT IN JANUARY OF THE

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.429
OF THE YEAR UNTIL THE BEGINNING

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:14.632
OF MARCH. THERE IS NO DISCLOSURE

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:15.566
REQUIREMENTS- IF YOU DON'T. SEE

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.201
THE CONTRIBUTION OVER A THOUSAND

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.436
DOLLARS. WE HAVE A DISCLOSURE

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.037
REQUIREMENT NINETY DAYS BEFORE

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.939
OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE.

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:23.808
SO THERE'S A GAP THERE- AND IN

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:26.310
FACT ANY CONTRIBUTION THAT YOU

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.912
RECEIVED IN THE FIRST. ALMOST

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:29.080
FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR YOU'RE

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:31.415
NOT EVEN REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.083
UNTIL THE END OF APRIL THE FIRST

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.552
PRE ELECTION REPORT. SO I DO SEE

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.586
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:37.555
CONTRIBUTIONS CLOSER TO ELECTION

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.523
I DO SEE YOU GET INTO THIS PLACE

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.226
THE SPACE OF POTENTIALLY HAVING

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:43.260
INTO A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:45.396
ELECTION. ADD TO THAT THE FACT

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:46.631
THAT WE'RE DOING ALL MAIL

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:48.499
BALLOTS. THE ACTUAL OPERATIVE

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.534
DATE OF THE ELECTION IS NOT IN

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.269
OUR CASE JUNE SEVENTH AND THIS

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.305
YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY BEGINS THE

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:55.773
BEGINNING OF MAY SO ACTUALLY.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.275
THE THE ABILITY TO AFFECT AN

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.877
ELECTION I CAN ACTUALLY HAPPENED

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.946
A LOT EARLIER- GIVEN THE- HOW

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.714
WE'VE IMPROVED OUR ACCESS TO THE

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.517
BALLOT OKAY. SO I DO SEE AND

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:07.385
THIS IS A CONSTRUCTIVE

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.053
SUGGESTION I'M I'M WILLING TO

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.254
HAVE YOUR BILL GO FORWARD WITH

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.289
MY SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEES

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:12.957
WILLING. BUT HERE'S WHERE I

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:14.458
THINK THE GAP COULD BE CLOSED

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.627
THAT HAS A MATERIAL EFFECT WOULD

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:18.529
BE MAKING TWO CHANGES. NUMBER

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:19.897
ONE IT WOULD BE CREATING AN

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.332
EARLIER PRE ELECTION REPORT ANY.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.968
DAY AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO BE AT

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:26.137
THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD OF

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.271
FEBRUARY. TO BE REPORTED IN THE

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.807
BEGINNING OF MARCH. AND NUMBER

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.809
TWO WOULD BE TO TAKE THE-

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:32.710
THOUSAND DOLLAR DISCLOSURE

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.211
REQUIREMENTS THAT CURRENTLY IS

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.713
NINETY DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.181
AND MOVE IT TO A HUNDRED DAYS

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.382
BEFORE THE ELECTION. NOW YOU'VE

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:40.584
CLOSED THE COMPLETE GAP. IN THE

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.153
ELECTION YEAR FOR DISCLOSURE BY

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.622
DOING THOSE TWO THINGS YEAH. I

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:45.790
THINK THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH MORE

00:38:45.856 --> 00:38:46.557
THAN WHAT YOUR BILL WILL

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.893
REQUIRE. IT ONLY CREATES A ONE

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:51.262
OBLIGATION OF A CANDIDATE WHICH

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.229
IS THE NEW PRE ELECTION AT THE

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.265
END OF FEBRUARY. TO BE REPORTED

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:55.766
THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. AND THEN

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.468
IT ADDS AT TEN DAY EXTENSION TO

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.270
THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR REPORT. YOU

00:38:59.336 --> 00:39:01.305
CLOSE THE GAP. AND HE A YOU

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.406
TAKEN AWAY THIS REPORTING

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:04.175
OBLIGATION AND OF AND A YEAR

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:05.676
BEFORE THE ELECTION. WHICH I

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:09.080
THINK CREATES A- A- PAPERWORK

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.915
TRAP FOR ANY CANDIDATE. BECAUSE

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.116
YOU'RE ONLY TRYING TO CLOSE.

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.518
BETWEEN TWENTY- FIVE THOUSAND

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.519
DOLLARS AND FIVE THOUSAND

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.388
DOLLARS OR WHATEVER ENDING BELOW

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.423
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ASSETS-

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.124
THAT THAT WOULD BE MY

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.292
CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION HOW TO

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:23.060
DO WHAT I THINK YOU ACCOMPLISH

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:24.695
WHAT MUCH OF WHAT YOU WANT

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.262
WITHOUT READING THAT PAPER

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:28.399
RETRACTED. THAT WE'VE ALL FALLEN

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:29.366
INTO. SO YOU ARE YOUR

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.868
SUGGESTIONS VERY WELCOME- THE

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.136
ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.271
THAT- LEASE ON THE ELECTION YEAR

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:35.873
IS THAT WE SEEM WE ARE

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.907
STRUGGLING BETWEEN WHETHER GONNA

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.175
HAVE MARCH PRIMARIES IN JUNE

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.311
PRIMARY SO WE HAVE TO JUST

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.779
FIGURE OUT. HOW THAT PLAYS BASED

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.748
ON A DIFFERENT PRIMARY DATE. THE

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.850
ONLY THE ONLY THE ONLY PUSH BACK

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:49.653
I'D I'D I'D PUT ON THE ON THE

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.321
QUESTION OF PREVIOUS YEARS. IS

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:52.523
THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT I'M THE

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.958
EARLY DAYS OF ELECTION ALSO

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:55.426
INVALID SELECTION RIGHT IT CAN

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.561
MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE MONEY

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:58.929
GAME YOU KNOW WHO RAISES THE

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.464
MOST MONEY OUT THE GATE FOR

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.867
EXAMPLE WHEN AN ELECTION STARTS.

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.568
JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.336
CALENDAR YEAR. BUILDING UP TO

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.404
THE ELECTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:08.506
THAT EARLY FUNDRAISING IS AN

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:09.607
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. IN HELPING

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.742
TO DETERMINE THE WAY THAT OUR

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.843
RACE- EVOLVES AND OF COURSE YOU

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.378
KNOW THERE'S ALSO INFLUENCE THAT

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.013
THAT THE MONEY CAN POTENTIALLY.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.449
SHED LIGHT ON OUR TO ELECTED

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.584
OFFICIALS SO. I'M I'M I'M WHAT I

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.219
LOVE TO DO- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:25.189
VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.924
ASTIR JERRY IS TO JUST. MAYBE

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:30.294
FIGURE OUT A- A SYSTEM FOR THE

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.897
PRE FOR THE PRE ELECTION YEARS.

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.231
THAT PROVIDES SOME MORE

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.533
DISCLOSURE THAN WE CURRENTLY

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.301
HAVE. BUT THAT IS NOT AS

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.804
RIGOROUS. AS WHAT YOU'RE

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.038
SUGGESTING FOR THE ELECTION

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.175
YEAR. AND I THINK IF WE CAN.

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.876
WORK WITH THAT CORE CONCEPT ON

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.912
SOME DETAILS TOGETHER AS IF THE

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.079
BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:51.048
I THAT WOULD I WAS REALLY MAKE

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.983
ME FEEL. HAPPY THAT I WOULD BE

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.819
THAT WOULD BE FINE TO DO THAT. I

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:57.021
WOULD NOTE THAT- AN EXAMPLE THAT

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:59.156
YOU JUST GAVE. THAT THOSE WHO

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.458
WANT TO SHOW THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:04.028
AS A MEASURE OF STRENGTH- THAT

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.029
DOESN'T CONFORM WITH THE

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:07.264
ELECTION. REPORTS THE SEMIANNUAL

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.667
REPORTS HAS EVERY RIGHT TO GO

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:10.301
AHEAD MAKE ANY DECLARATION OR

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.002
DISCLOSURE. THEY HAVE. ON THE

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:13.771
POSITIVE SIDE- AND ON THE

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:14.839
NEGATIVE SIDE THAT SOMEHOW

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:16.540
SOMEONE TAKING A CONTRIBUTION A

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.175
YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION. I

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.376
WOULD SOMEHOW SOMEHOW HAVE

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:21.245
IMMUNITY. IS IT REALLY THE CASE

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.813
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.216
SEMI ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FIVE OR

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.951
MORE MONTHS BEFORE AN ELECTION

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:28.219
WHERE ANYONE CAN SEE THOSE

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.253
DISCLOSURES AND TAKE WHATEVER

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.188
MAKE WHATEVER OPINION THEY WOULD

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.257
HAVE. ABOUT IT. NEVERTHELESS I

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.459
APPRECIATE THE GOALS THAT YOU'VE

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.060
ESTABLISHING YOUR BILL I THINK

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.328
THAT WE CAN WORK ON THOSE

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:39.563
TOGETHER. AS THE BILL MOVES

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.299
FORWARD IF THE COMMITTEE AGREES

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:43.834
. PRESIDENT MODESTO IS TO REALLY

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:45.970
GO AHEAD. YEAH BRIEFLY. I THINK

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:48.739
CENTER ON AND I THINK YOU MITCH

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:49.340
REALLY GOOD POINT. EARLY MONEY

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.909
GOES MOSTLY UNEXAMINED- BUT IT

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.144
HAS A HUGE IMPACT- AS TO

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.347
POSITIONING AS TO VIABILITY AND

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.382
I THINK IT'S RELEVANT. TO SHED

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.084
AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AS TO

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.852
WHO SUPPORT SECOND WHO IS ME

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.487
THEY CAN'T A VIABLE. I THINK

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:04.388
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE OFTEN

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:06.423
FORGET THAT. THAT THOUSAND

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.094
DOLLAR THRESHOLD- IS. THE REASON

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.196
WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW FOR THE

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.464
AVERAGE PERSON A THOUSAND BOX IS

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.133
REAL MONEY. RIGHT REAL MONEY AND

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.968
SO IT IS MORE THAN WORTHWHILE TO

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.337
ME. TO HAVE AS TRANSPARENT AS

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.339
POSSIBLE A BASIS FOR SAYING. YOU

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:24.541
YOU KNOW WHO GIVE SMALL YOU GUYS

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:25.776
BIG MONEY BIG MONEY IS WHAT

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.112
DETERMINES VIABILITY- CONTEXT I

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.380
THINK IT'S EVERYTHING YOU THINK

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:31.916
TO DO YOU KNOW TO YOUR THINKING.

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:32.983
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE BY

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.018
THE SUBMISSION DEADLINES ARE A

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:36.020
BIG DEAL IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:36.854
GETS REPORTED THOSE ARE THE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.088
THOSE ARE THE- THE TRACTION

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.024
POINTS OF THE MILESTONES YOUR-

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.425
YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN THE SCOOTY

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.259
SUPPLIED. SO I THINK WE SHOULD

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.094
ASPIRE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.896
REAL TIME REPORTING. TO MR

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:48.232
BALOCH POINT ABOUT SYSTEMS- AT

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.967
SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:52.102
KNOW THERE SHOULD BE MORE OR

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:53.604
LESS CONTINUAL. AND THAT LEVEL

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:54.805
TRANSPARENCY WOULD DO TWO

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.074
THINGS- IT WOULD GIVE. VOTERS TO

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.575
MAKE FULL. MISTER WHO SUPPORTS

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:00.878
HIM. BUT ALSO GIVE A VERY

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.780
DIFFERENT BASIS FOR YOU KNOW THE

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.248
REPORTING ON RACES AND I THINK

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:06.917
THAT THAT WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:08.285
STRESS OUT OF THESE MILESTONES.

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.487
MULLIN I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA-

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:14.758
REMEMBER WHO PAYS. FOR ELECTIONS

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.260
IT'S NOT THE LITTLE GUY. SENATOR

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.329
JUST I JUST TO SAY MY COMMON-

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:18.996
WHICH- NEWMAN AYE AYE COMPLETELY

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:19.997
AGREE DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.266
DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE. HOW CAN

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.534
YOU DO THAT WITHOUT CHAU

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.935
BURDENING THE SYSTEM WOULD COST

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.603
SO MUCH MONEY AND YOU PLAY THE

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.805
GOTCHA GAME THAT WOULD CONCERN

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:30.274
BY. COFFEE INFORMED. THINKING

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:33.110
EARLIER- BUT IT WAS AND IT WAS

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.878
IN THE DANNATT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:36.747
THIS FOR SO LONG AND I. HAVE

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.148
SPENT SO MUCH OF MY LIFE

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.149
INVOLVEMENT WE GET ALL THE VOTER

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.452
STUFF TOGETHER IN THE SAME DAY

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:42.119
VOTING. TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATION

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.053
ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY IT'S SO

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.321
FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT HAPPENS IN

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:45.255
THIS COMMITTEE IN WHICH WE

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:47.291
SHOULD DO OUR DEMOCRACY SO I'M-

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.959
I'M ALL WITHIN A BE HAPPY TO

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.494
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:52.429
THAT ELEMENT I JUST WANT TO

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.063
BALANCE OUT THOSE ELEMENTS OF

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.198
COST. AND GOTCHA IN TERMS OF

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.066
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND YEAH

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:58.502
WEEK IF WE COULD DO REAL TIME

00:43:58.569 --> 00:43:59.103
REPORTING THAT WOULD BE THE

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.971
BEST. AT ALL TIMES TO BE THE

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.072
BEST FOR EVERYTHING. YEAH I MEAN

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.408
OF COURSE THAT'S A THAT'S A

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.442
BURDEN RIGHT I MEAN SO. THAT'S

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:07.277
A- LOT OF. TWENTY THREE NO NOT

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.046
NOT REALLY IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.015
A BURDEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:12.016
FILL OUT THE REPORTS THAT

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.517
LITERALLY. THERE WAS A SYSTEM

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:14.918
BUILT WITH THE SECTOR STATES

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:15.519
OFFICE WHEN THE CONTRIBUTIONS

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.121
MADE YOU CLICK THE BUTTON. THAT

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.123
IS NOT VERY HARD TO DO. YOUR

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.324
POINT IS WE JUST DO REAL TIME

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.026
REPORTING AND BUT THE REPORTS A

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:24.495
LOT WHAT DO YOU DO REAL TIME

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:25.195
REPORTING REPORTS AREN'T THAT IT

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.196
WOULD TAKE UP THE THIRD PARTY

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.065
INTERMEDIARY AND IT BECOMES A

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:29.166
WHOLE DIFFERENT PLACE I THINK

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.300
ISN'T WHAT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.969
BECAUSE I'M NOT. YOU KNOW. BUT I

SUBSTANTIAL SO CLEARLY

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.615

CONSEQUENCES. THERE WAS RECENTLY

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:37.986
SOME LEGISLATION TO ALLOW

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.900
CONSEQUENCE THAT CAN ENSUE. AND

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.902

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:30.439
