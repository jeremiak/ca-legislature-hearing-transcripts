OPPORTUNITIES

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IT'S A TO TRY TO.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:45.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TO INCENTIVIZE

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:48.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL FOLKS FROM GETTING OFF OF A

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:49.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%

GET EDUCATION.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:54.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A TO PROVIDE ITS I DON'T WANT TO

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DIS INCENTIVIZE THEM.

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A TO GET OFF OF OF CAL WORKS

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:02.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:03.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE OF THOSE I MEAN LOOKS LIKE

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE COST COULD BE.

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:06.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND I KNOW THE SUPPOSED HE

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:07.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
COMMITTEE.

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE COST

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:10.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD BE A IN THE MID MILLIONS

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:10.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF DOLLARS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:13.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THAT IS.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:13.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO YOU WE WERE TRYING TO

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DYNAMIC BETWEEN BETWEEN THAT

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:20.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SURE.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:20.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE COST ACTUALLY WOULDN'T BE

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:21.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE MAJORITY

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF FAMILIES COMING OFF CAL WORKS

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY MOVING TO ANOTHER MEDI

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAL PROGRAM UNDER THE MATCH AYE

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RUBRIC. SO THERE AT ELIGIBLE

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHERWISE WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CREATES A BUFFER FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE STILL GONE ABOVE THAT A

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:33.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LITTLE MORE SO IT DOES CREATE AN

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCENTIVE TO NOT ONLY FIND A JOB

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:36.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FIND A JOB THAT PAYS WELL.

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:39.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

PERIOD IN WHICH YOU CAN

WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE EIGHT

THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:50.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR TWELVE

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

ITALIAN CITIZEN EXAMPLE.

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IT'S ONE THAT'S CLEAR MY

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MIND BECAUSE IT'S RECENT BUT

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:17.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S A IT'S A HABITUAL PATTERN.

01:39:17.284 --> 01:39:18.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I THINK THE SURVEY SHOWS

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT'S NOT JUST MY EXPERIENCE

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIANS AND

OFF THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED THAT

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANSWER THAT THERE'S PROBABLY

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SEVEN THOUSAND DIDN'T.

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

WE HAVEN'T BEEN.

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:16.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ONLY THING THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:33.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

TO THEIR SURVEY ACTUALLY.

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:37.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS.

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:40.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:41.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN WHEN THEY DID SURVEY THEIR

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:42.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEMBERS I MEAN WE DO HAVE TO

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:44.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:44.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STATED. THAT THEIR APPEALS ROOF

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:48.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE EITHER RESOLVED ALWAYS MOST

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:50.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OFTEN OR AT LEAST HALF THE TIME

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:51.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN THEY JUST WENT THROUGH THE

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH PLAN'S INTERNAL DISPUTE

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:53.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
RESOLUTION PROCESS.

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO THAT PROCESS WHICH IS

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:56.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXISTING LAW. YOU KNOW ACHIEVES

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
RESULTS.

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:00.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW THAT AGAIN I HAVE TO

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAY. THEIR SURVEY ALSO SHOWS A

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:03.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROVIDERS ALL OVERWHELMINGLY

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:05.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FEEL TO USE THE DAMAGE HE'S

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDER COMPLAINTS SYSTEM. AND

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN THEY WERE ASKED WHY THEY

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DID USE IT A MAJORITY OF THEM SO

01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:12.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT
SO.

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:12.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:15.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:18.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL IF I COULD GO AHEAD ANSWER.

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:20.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YEAH WELL I THINK THE.

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:23.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE WAY WE INTERPRET THAT IS

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:24.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT DO ITS HAS LOW USAGE

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:27.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:29.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERMISSIVE THE DM DM EIGHT SEE

01:45:29.122 --> 01:45:30.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROCESSES PERMISSIVE. ARE THEY

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:33.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PROVIDER COMPLAINTS.

01:45:35.529 --> 01:45:37.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THEY DO IT.

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIKE WHEN AN ASSOCIATION LIKE

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:40.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OURS IN OUR MEMBERS.

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:43.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UP ALERT US AND WE GATHER THE

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:45.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INFORMATION AND TAKE IT TO

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:46.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DAMAGE CMA AND THEY DO AN

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INVESTIGATION. I THINK.

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:50.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CLEARLY THAT.

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:54.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT THE LAST DOCTOR ABLE SAID

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:55.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOCTORS ARE BUSY SEEING PATIENTS

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE FACT THAT WE GOT SEVEN

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:58.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUNDRED FORTY ONE RESPONSES AND

01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:59.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SUCH AMOUNT OF TIME SHOWS

01:45:59.119 --> 01:45:59.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE'S A LOT OF INTENSITY

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:00.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AROUND THIS? THAT THE PROBLEM

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CONTINUES EVEN AFTER.

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:04.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LAWS THAT WERE PASSED EIGHT

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:06.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO AND SO WHAT

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:09.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS TO.

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:12.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PUT ENOUGH TEETH INTO THE LAW

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:13.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THAT HEALTH PLANS AREN'T

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:15.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ESSENTIALLY MAKING A BUSINESS

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECISION WHERE FOR MONTHS AND

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MONTHS AND MONTHS THEY CONTINUE

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:21.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THIS UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. OF

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UNDERPAYING DENYING CLAIMS.

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TO PROVIDERS.

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:27.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THEN GETTING WHAT IS

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:29.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESSENTIALLY AFTER THEY'VE MADE

01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:29.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:32.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RETAINING THIS MONEY OR KEEPING

01:46:32.252 --> 01:46:32.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE MONEY OUT OF THE HANDS OF

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:35.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY'RE OWED

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:37.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND GETTING WHAT'S RELATIVELY A

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:39.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
SMALL.

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:41.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FINE FOR THAT SO IT SIMPLY

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECOMES A BUSINESS DECISION FOR

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:46.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEM TO TAKE THE FINE AND AND

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:49.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAKE THE MONEY SO WHAT ALL WE'RE

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAYING IS IS TO ROUTE TO HELP

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MITIGATE THIS BEHAVIOR. BY.

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:57.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GIVING ARE PROVIDING THAT

01:46:57.744 --> 01:46:59.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEPARTMENTS HEALTH CARE WITH THE

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:03.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AUTHORITY TO LEVY A MORE SEVERE

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FINES.

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:06.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADDRESS RIGHT QUICKLY IS THE

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:10.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IDEA OF THIS.

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:11.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:47:11.458 --> 01:47:11.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHETHER THEY INVESTIGATE

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:12.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
INDIVIDUAL OR PATTERNS

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:13.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CURRENTLY DIEM MAKE SEE SAYS

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:14.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ONCE YOU GO THROUGH THE

PLAN'S INTERNAL PROCESS. AND

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:17.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTHING IS RESOLVED AND YOU CAN

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:18.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
USE A DUE TO MAKE SEE PROC

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:18.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROCESS AND YOU CAN'T SUBMIT

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:19.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS FOR THEIR

OKAY SO.

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:13.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHY CAN'T BE ADMINISTRATIVELY TO

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THIS?

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:19.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEY DO HAVE CURRENTLY.

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HAVE WITH FORTY TO DO

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:22.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

IT'S A BROAD AUTHORITY IT IS SO

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:30.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THEY WANT THERE'S A.

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:32.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S NO SPECIFICS ON WHAT

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:33.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TYPES OF PENALTIES AND FINES AT

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEAST FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:36.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THEY SHOULD APPLY. SO

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:37.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CURRENTLY THEY DO DO THESE AS I

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:39.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SAID IT'S PERMISSIVE.

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:40.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:41.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THEY

01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:43.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE POWER THE

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:46.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PEOPLE HOURS IN ORDER TO

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INVESTIGATE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:47.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OF THESE.

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:50.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDER COMPLAINTS IN THIS IS

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT VISIT JUST POSITIONS THAT'S

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVIDERS ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:55.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:57.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO DO AN ADEQUATE JOB OF

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:59.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
MITIGATING BEHAVIOR.

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:01.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THAT IS HARMING OF.

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:07.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES.

01:49:07.874 --> 01:49:09.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
VERY FEW.

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:10.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF CASES

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:11.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE PAYMENT OR SERVICES HAVE

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BEEN MISSED THAT HAS BEEN

01:49:13.413 --> 01:49:14.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DETRIMENTAL TO.

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:17.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PATIENT'S LIFE OR ME LIKE I

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAW THE OTHER STATISTICS BUT.

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:20.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND IF

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:21.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:21.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIGNIFICANT THAT'S HAPPENED

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:24.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
THAT'S.

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:25.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FORCING YOU TO BRING THIS

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:26.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FORWARD NOW.

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I BROUGHT A FOUR BECAUSE ON THE

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SECOND ONE TO BE ABOVE THE FOLD.

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:32.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC.

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:36.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF PROVIDER THAT WAS ABROAD TO

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:37.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION. AND IT

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:40.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AFFECTS MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:42.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANY RURAL DISTRICTS AS WELL.

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:43.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND IF I COULD.

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YET WHEN WE DID THE SURVEY WE

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:47.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO ASKED FOR EXAMPLES OF OF

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW. OF THIS BEHAVIOR BY THE

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:50.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PLANS IMPACTED.

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:52.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PATIENT CARE IN THEIR ABILITY

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:53.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO DO THE PRACTICE I THINK

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOCTOR ABLE PRESENTED ONE AND AN

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EXAMPLE MAYBE ONE HERE BUT

COMPLY WITH THAT CALLED PRE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AUTHORIZATION HEALTH PLAN

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSERVE TRACKS IT OUT TO THIRD

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:06.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PARTY WHICH IS STAFFED BY.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RADIOLOGISTS WHO YOU KNOW ARE

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:10.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRESUMABLY SEEING PATIENTS

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:11.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE TO TAKE

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:12.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE PHONE CALLS TYPICALLY.

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I HAVE A STAFFER DO THE INITIAL

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:16.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALL AND THEY DO THE CALL WITH

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:20.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERSON AND I ALSO HAVE COMPUTER

01:50:20.213 --> 01:50:21.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOFTWARE THAT MATCHES STUFF UP.

01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:24.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO. THE DATA IS THERE IS TO THE

IN THE YOU KNOW PREPARE IN

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE CASES ARE PRETTY CLEAR

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:37.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THESE ARE.

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:39.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BORDERLINE THINGS EITHER THINGS

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:40.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THEIR SOFTWARE SAYS IT'S

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OKAY TO DO.

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THEN AFTER THE FACT.

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:46.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I'VE USED THIS THIRD PARTY

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:47.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE GOTTEN APPROVED BY AND. YOU

01:50:47.674 --> 01:50:49.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW IF I NEED TO I GO UP TO A

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:51.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LICENSED PHYSICIAN A RADIOLOGIST

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TYPICALLY.

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WHO SAN WHO'S HEARD IT AND

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:56.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SAYS IT'S NECESSARY.

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:59.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND THEN.

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:01.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LATER AFTER THE. CLAIM IS BEEN

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:04.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
POSTED. AND AND.

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:05.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INSTEAD OF PAYING THE CLAIM THAT

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:06.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY AGREED THAT THEY'RE GONNA

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO BECAUSE THE PATIENT NEEDED IT

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:09.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THE REASON THAT THEY HAD A

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:11.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIFE THREATENING DIAGNOSIS. THEY

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SAY SEND US RECORDS.

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THEY DON'T SAY CENTERS ONE

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:17.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECORD DON'T SAY SEND THE TEST

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:18.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU DID THIS AND SEND ALL

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:19.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE RECORDS.

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:21.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WE SEND ALL THE RECORDS.

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEN WE DON'T GET A RESPONSE

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:24.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
BACK ON THAT.

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:25.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THEN THERE'S A TALK TO A

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:27.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CLOCK TICKING

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOU DON'T GET AND TIME IT'S

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:31.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DENIED BECAUSE OF TIME.

01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:33.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I YOU KNOW I'VE GOT OTHER

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:36.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINGS TO DO SO SOMETIMES I MISS

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:37.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT DEADLINE AND YOU KNOW I'D I

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:39.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DELEGATE AS MUCH OF THIS TO

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:40.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
STAFF AS I CAN.

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:42.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT. IT REALLY SEEMS STRATEGIC

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:44.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAM AND DE THERE APPARENTLY THIS

01:51:44.497 --> 01:51:46.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ISN'T JUST MY EXPERIENCE OF

ON THIS ONE SO THAT THEY CAN

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY CAN MAYBE ANSWER WHETHER

ONE OF THOSE BEHAVIORS. THAT

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:27.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NGUYEN DONE IN A PATTERN.

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:29.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT WOULD COULD BE AFTER OF

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:30.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INVESTIGATION DETERMINED TO BE

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:33.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR OF A PATTERN

01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:34.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR SO.

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:36.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S IN THE REGULATIONS AND

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT DR ABEL'S TALK ABOUT IS

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:41.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABSOLUTELY ONE ISSUES THAT COULD

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:43.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE ADDRESSED BY THE SPELL.

01:54:43.743 --> 01:54:46.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS IS

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:48.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT YOUR CONTENTION THAT EVERY

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:51.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
CLAIM BE ADJUDICATED IN THIS
WAY.

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:55.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:57.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON DMA SEE IN

01:54:57.957 --> 01:54:59.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE.

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:01.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE HOPING THAT THROUGH BY

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:03.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GETTING A SPELL THIS PASSES THAT

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:04.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
WILL WORK DMA.

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:05.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
H. C. ON THE MAKING SURE THAT

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:06.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO MAKE

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:08.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SURE THESE THINGS GET THROUGH.

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:10.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO I WOULD WANT THEM TO GO

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:11.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THROUGH ABSOLUTELY.

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:17.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:55:17.377 --> 01:55:18.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YES WHISPERED TO TEAR YEAH I AM

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:19.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND I THINK.

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:20.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
JUST TO.

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:21.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PUT A LITTLE MORE.

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:23.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERBIAGE AROUND WHAT TO SOMEONE

01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:25.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAID I THINK ONCE AGAIN IT'S

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:28.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALREADY PART OF THEIR. JIM MADE

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:28.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
SEEDS.

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:31.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A REGULATIONS THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:35.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISPUTES CAN BE SUBMITTED TO

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:36.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEM FOR CONSIDERATION.

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:37.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:39.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE BILL IS TO

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
APPLY THE ENHANCED PENALTIES.

01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:43.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO THOSE PLANS THAT THAT THERE

01:55:43.136 --> 01:55:44.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WOULD THERE'S A PATTERN OF.

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:46.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR SO I THINK

01:55:46.873 --> 01:55:48.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MOVING FORWARD IF THE IF THE

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:50.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CURRENT LANGUAGE DOESN'T DO THAT

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:51.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIT DOWN WITH. THE OPPONENT'S.

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:55.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DE MATE SEE AND ANYONE ELSE TO

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:57.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WRITTEN IN THE WAY TO ENSURE

01:55:58.818 --> 01:55:59.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ENHANCED PENALTIES APPLY TO

01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:04.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR.

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THEN I GUESS MY QUESTION TO

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:02.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS COLLECTED THROUGH THE LAMB

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:05.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAYS AND AND PROVIDED TO THE

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:07.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABSENCE WILL BE IN A WAY THAT

02:10:07.766 --> 02:10:09.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE DATA WILL BE USEFUL.

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT EACH ONE

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OF THOSE.

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:13.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
M. SAYS MAYBE REPORTING IN

DIFFERENT FORMATS.

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:17.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE ARE

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:18.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
HUMAN CONDITIONS.

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:20.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND EACH CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:23.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS ARE MAY BE

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:25.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
DIFFICULT TO.

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:27.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO GET TO THROUGH JUST STRICT

02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:29.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DATA THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

02:10:29.288 --> 02:10:30.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT ALL HOSPITALS REPORT

02:10:30.756 --> 02:10:32.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE EIGHT

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:34.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PATIENT DELAY SO YOU MIGHT BE

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:36.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

A LARGE VOLUME TO A HOSPITAL

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:38.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THAT DOES NOT.

02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:39.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:43.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OPPOSITION.

02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:28.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT

02:41:28.245 --> 02:41:29.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ONE PERSON.

02:41:29.312 --> 02:41:30.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
RELATIONS

02:41:30.313 --> 02:41:31.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WOULD BE IN EFFECT

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:34.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
NUMBER TO USE FOR.

02:41:34.384 --> 02:41:36.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
AND THEN YOU CAN GROW FROM
THERE.

02:41:36.186 --> 02:41:37.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IF YOU HAD AN AVERAGE OF

02:41:37.721 --> 02:41:39.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TEN

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:42.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PATIENT.

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:43.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU CAN SEE THIS IS GOING TO BE

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
A VERY LARGE NUMBER SO THE

02:41:45.162 --> 02:41:47.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONCERN THAT I'M RAISING.

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:49.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ONE TO

02:41:49.499 --> 02:41:50.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE AUTHOR I THINK THE POLICY IS

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:51.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOUND IN GOING IN AND IN HIS

02:41:51.835 --> 02:41:53.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIRECTION I JUST WOULD LIKE TO

02:41:53.937 --> 02:41:54.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORK THROUGH THIS THAT WE CAN

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:55.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DEFINE.

02:41:55.539 --> 02:41:57.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH AN OPEN SET OF EYES THAT

02:41:57.074 --> 02:41:58.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY LARGE BITE

02:41:58.208 --> 02:42:01.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OUT OF THE.

02:42:01.545 --> 02:42:03.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY THINK YOU GOT I I'M VERY

02:42:03.146 --> 02:42:04.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COGNIZANT I APPRECIATE YOU

02:42:04.514 --> 02:42:06.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRESSING THAT POINT AND I'M

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:06.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
GONNA ASK.

02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:09.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOCTOR ARROYO TO ANSWER IT BUT

02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:11.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE POINT THAT I DID FORGET WAS.

02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:12.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WENT ON IT WE WE WERE INITIALLY

02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:14.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TALKING ABOUT THIS CONCEPT AND

02:42:14.558 --> 02:42:16.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IDEA I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT HOW MUCH FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:42:19.029 --> 02:42:20.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:22.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IF THERE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY

02:42:22.132 --> 02:42:23.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO BE ABLE TO NOT TAP INTO

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:27.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GENERAL FUND BUT USE FUNDS THAT

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:28.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN AND

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:31.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HOPE. LAW.

02:42:31.308 --> 02:42:32.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
EXPANDING OVER TIME.

02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:35.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR.

02:42:35.512 --> 02:42:39.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMPLEMENTATION OF OF OF OF. THE

02:42:39.783 --> 02:42:41.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEW INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA.

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:43.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BE ABLE

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:45.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO LEVERAGE THAT AND TAKE

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF FEDERAL

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:49.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DOLLARS AS WELL THAT WAS.

02:42:49.593 --> 02:42:51.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR.

02:42:51.795 --> 02:42:53.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH IT FIVE FIVE MAY BE FURTHER

02:42:53.396 --> 02:42:54.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
INDULGED.

02:42:54.898 --> 02:42:56.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:59.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AS THIS BEGINS TO BE

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:01.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPLEMENTED AND TO EXPAND WE

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:02.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL SEE COST SAVINGS IN OTHER

02:43:02.739 --> 02:43:05.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SECTORS.

02:43:05.075 --> 02:43:08.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO I IT'S FAR. BETTER ESTIMATING

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE COST IS RATHER CALM

02:43:10.447 --> 02:43:11.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COMPLICATED IN THAT.

02:43:11.882 --> 02:43:13.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE COST

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:14.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SAVINGS.

02:43:14.918 --> 02:43:17.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN OTHER COMPONENTS OF HEALTH

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:18.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
CARE.

02:43:18.488 --> 02:43:20.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUVENILE JUSTICE I EDUCATION

02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:22.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AND SO FORTH SO.

02:43:22.626 --> 02:43:23.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ALTHOUGH.

02:43:24.628 --> 02:43:26.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
AT AT.

02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:27.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIRST GLANCE.

02:43:27.964 --> 02:43:30.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE WOULD BE A COSTS FOR DATA.

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:32.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TREATMENT.

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:34.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUT IT WOULD BE OFFSET

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BY COSTS AND OTHER SECTORS.

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:40.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DO SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND.

02:43:40.076 --> 02:43:42.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HE RICH MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU

02:43:44.814 --> 02:43:47.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT YESTERDAY I HAD THE CHANCE

02:43:47.317 --> 02:43:48.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO MEET WITH THE FOLKS FROM THIS

02:43:48.652 --> 02:43:49.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:51.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
INITIATIVE.

02:43:51.855 --> 02:43:52.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%

ABUSE DISORDERS ON.

02:43:57.327 --> 02:43:58.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND ONE OF THE REALLY

02:43:59.029 --> 02:44:00.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTERESTING FACTS THAT THEY'VE

02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:01.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEEN DOING SOME STUDIES IN

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:02.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NEUROSCIENCE.

02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:04.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND ITS EFFECTS

02:44:04.868 --> 02:44:06.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MUM ASSOCIATED WITH YOU KNOW

02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:08.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO GET

02:44:08.505 --> 02:44:10.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDICTIONS OF ISSUES AND THINGS

02:44:10.807 --> 02:44:12.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIKE THAT AND I FOUND THAT. WHEN

02:44:12.342 --> 02:44:14.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU LOOK AT USE FROM THE AGES OF

02:44:14.177 --> 02:44:16.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ELEVEN TO TWENTY FIVE IS THE

02:44:16.146 --> 02:44:18.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHEST CHANCE THE PEOPLE ARE

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:20.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING TO GET ADDICTED THAT'S

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:22.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN THE BRAIN IS AT THAT WEIRD

02:44:22.352 --> 02:44:23.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STAGE THAT YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW

02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:25.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A LOT BETTER THAN I DO AS FAR AS

02:44:25.855 --> 02:44:26.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THE TERMINOLOGY BUT.

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:29.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S THIS POINT OF TIME A

02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:33.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE.

02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:34.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATION

02:44:34.564 --> 02:44:36.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE HAVE FAILED I THINK

02:44:36.366 --> 02:44:38.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS THE CALIFORNIA. TO PUT MONEY

02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:41.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE

02:44:41.504 --> 02:44:42.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

HEALTH.

02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:45.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE STILL

02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:48.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVING TO PAY AT THE OTHER END.

02:44:48.178 --> 02:44:48.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

02:44:48.378 --> 02:44:49.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:44:50.013 --> 02:44:52.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY HAD. ONE

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:54.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THING I STARTED ALL OVER BECAUSE

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:56.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S WHEN MY BIGGEST HOME

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:57.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ISSUES WITH CALIFORNIA'S THAT

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY JUST HAVE NOT COME TO THE

02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:01.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALIZATION THAT THEY NEED TO

02:45:01.524 --> 02:45:04.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PUT MONEY TOWARDS OPIOID. ABUSE.

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:06.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND TREATMENTS.

02:45:06.496 --> 02:45:07.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IT'S IT JUST DOESN'T HEAR

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:08.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

02:58:42.878 --> 02:58:44.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT OTHER

02:58:44.313 --> 02:58:45.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FACTORS WHETHER THE PERSON

02:58:45.915 --> 02:58:46.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HANDED ME NO MENTAL HEALTH

02:58:46.982 --> 02:58:48.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:52.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DRUGS POSSIBLY POLY DRUG USE OR?

02:58:52.588 --> 02:58:54.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHETHER THERE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED

02:58:54.323 --> 02:58:55.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OR THEY HADN'T EATEN WHAT

02:58:55.291 --> 02:58:56.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MULTIPLE DAYS ARE A COMBINATION

02:58:56.692 --> 02:58:57.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OF ALL.

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:00.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I OFTENTIMES HAD A GOOD RAPPORT

02:59:00.329 --> 02:59:01.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH THIS DEMOGRAPHIC IN AND

02:59:01.831 --> 02:59:03.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY KNEW WHO I WAS AND I KNEW

02:59:03.265 --> 02:59:05.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHO THEY WERE IN. AND IT

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:07.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OFTENTIMES I WOULD KNOW WHAT

02:59:07.336 --> 02:59:08.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THEIR BASELINE WAS.

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS AND

02:59:10.639 --> 02:59:11.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IF THEY WERE DE COME DE

02:59:11.807 --> 02:59:14.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
COMPENSATING.

02:59:14.310 --> 02:59:16.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I WOULD LOOK AT THE SITUATION

02:59:16.579 --> 02:59:18.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IF THERE WERE F. I WAS ABLE

02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:20.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO PROVIDE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:59:20.149 --> 02:59:21.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROVIDE FOOD SHELTER AND

02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:23.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CLOTHING FOR THEMSELVES.

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:24.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:59:24.987 --> 02:59:26.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FOOD FOR THEMSELVES.

02:59:26.822 --> 02:59:28.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN IF THEY HAD TO BEG FOR IT

02:59:28.657 --> 02:59:30.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OR GOES THE DUMPSTER.

02:59:30.926 --> 02:59:32.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY THEY HAD FOOD THEY'RE

02:59:32.461 --> 02:59:34.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CARRYING A BLANKET THEY WERE

02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:35.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABLE TO PROVIDE SHELTER. IF THEY

02:59:35.631 --> 02:59:37.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
HAD.

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:38.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF THEY'RE WEARING CLOTHES IN

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:41.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WERE CLOSED IT IF THEY KNEW

02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW TO GET TO WHERE DAY SHELTER.

02:59:42.505 --> 02:59:43.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEN THEY DID NOT MEET THE

02:59:43.472 --> 02:59:47.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CRITERIA.

02:59:47.309 --> 02:59:50.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE.

02:59:50.146 --> 02:59:51.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE PEOPLE WANDERING AROUND

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:54.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PSYCHOSIS.

02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:55.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF THEY DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:56.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I OFTEN HAD TO LEAVE THEM TO

02:59:56.552 --> 02:59:57.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
DRAFT

02:59:57.953 --> 02:59:59.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND POTENTIALLY GOING TO SOME

02:59:59.622 --> 03:00:01.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:03.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF THE BEHAVIOR WAS BIZARRE

03:00:03.325 --> 03:00:04.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTIMIDATING TO OTHERS IN THEY

03:00:04.793 --> 03:00:06.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WOULDN'T. THEY WOULD NOT BE

03:00:06.529 --> 03:00:07.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCEPTED INTO SHELTERS A RESPITE

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:09.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CENTERS.

03:00:09.298 --> 03:00:11.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO ABSENT ANY OTHER CHOICES I

03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:12.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN THE MIDST OF

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:14.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR HALLUCINATIONS PARKING AT

03:00:14.970 --> 03:00:16.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

SNIPERS BATTLING SPIDERS GREAT

03:00:19.208 --> 03:00:21.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FROM THEIR SKIN.

03:00:21.577 --> 03:00:23.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
THESE PEOPLE NEEDED A SAFE
PLACE.

03:00:23.445 --> 03:00:25.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO BE AND WHETHER THEY WERE

03:00:25.114 --> 03:00:27.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DETOXING FORMER DRUG OR THEY

03:00:27.516 --> 03:00:28.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH.

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:30.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ISSUE.

03:00:30.786 --> 03:00:32.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THESE I BELIEVE THAT.

03:00:32.788 --> 03:00:34.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT THEY NEEDED HELP.

03:00:34.423 --> 03:00:35.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

03:00:35.991 --> 03:00:37.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF THAT MEANS MODIFYING THIS

03:00:37.459 --> 03:00:39.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GRAVELY DISABLED BURBAGE

03:00:39.461 --> 03:00:40.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:43.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

ABILITY MORE OF A DISCRETIONARY

03:00:45.201 --> 03:00:46.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ABILITY.

03:00:46.735 --> 03:00:47.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO GET THE PEOPLE TO THE MENTAL

HEALTH.

03:00:49.939 --> 03:00:51.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CENTERS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:52.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HELP.

03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:54.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%

03:00:54.877 --> 03:00:57.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND DESERVE.

03:00:57.079 --> 03:00:58.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEN I WOULD ASK YOU TO GIVE.

03:00:58.614 --> 03:01:04.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BUT I VOTE.

03:01:04.186 --> 03:01:05.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:06.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MISTER CHAIRMAN RENTAL HAGER FOR

REASONS THAT YOU NEED HERE TODAY

03:01:11.927 --> 03:01:13.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES ON THIS

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:13.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BILL.

03:01:14.063 --> 03:01:15.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT LET ME JUST PROVIDE SOME

03:01:15.664 --> 03:01:15.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CONTEXT.

03:01:15.898 --> 03:01:17.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:01:17.399 --> 03:01:18.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NO THE LPS ACTIVES FIFTY ONE

YEARS OLD IT WAS DESIGNED TO

03:01:20.436 --> 03:01:21.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HELP PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT HELP

03:01:21.604 --> 03:01:22.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THEMSELVES.

03:01:23.005 --> 03:01:24.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DESIGN CRITERIA DANGER TO

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:26.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SELF DANGER TO OTHERS GREATLY

03:01:26.475 --> 03:01:27.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISABLED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAKE DISCRIMINATIONS ABOUT SOME

03:01:29.278 --> 03:01:30.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:33.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT AT AT AT AT THE VERY BOTTOM

03:01:33.315 --> 03:01:35.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW TO

03:01:35.317 --> 03:01:37.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EVALUATE OUR RISK OF HARM

03:01:37.086 --> 03:01:39.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FOR INDIVIDUALS.

03:01:39.421 --> 03:01:41.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WHEN THE DRAFTERS DID THAT.

03:01:41.824 --> 03:01:44.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY ESTABLISHED THREE CRITERIA

03:01:44.126 --> 03:01:46.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AS A

03:01:46.595 --> 03:01:48.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CENTRAL HUMAN NEEDS.

03:01:48.097 --> 03:01:49.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY NEVER

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:50.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONSIDERED HEALTH CARE AND

03:01:50.933 --> 03:01:52.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HEALTH NEEDS IN THAT.

03:01:52.401 --> 03:01:54.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ANALYSIS

03:01:54.069 --> 03:01:55.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR TODAY

03:01:55.537 --> 03:01:57.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE ISSUE HERE BEFORE US IS

03:01:57.273 --> 03:01:58.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHETHER OR NOT HEALTH NEEDS.

03:01:58.874 --> 03:02:01.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR ESSENTIAL HUMAN NEEDS JUST

03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:03.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE FOO CLOTHING AND SHELTER.

03:02:03.746 --> 03:02:04.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:05.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DOES I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:02:05.748 --> 03:02:07.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
IMPORTANT.

03:02:07.283 --> 03:02:10.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PSYCHIATRISTS EVERY DAY HAVE TO.

03:02:10.819 --> 03:02:12.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WATCH AS PATIENTS THAT THEY HAD

03:02:12.788 --> 03:02:14.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MET TO SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ARE

03:02:14.957 --> 03:02:16.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEN RELEASED AT A SUBSEQUENT

03:02:16.792 --> 03:02:18.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOURTEEN DAY HOLD. BECAUSE

03:02:18.894 --> 03:02:19.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HEARING OFFICERS ARE NOT

03:02:19.728 --> 03:02:21.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE HEALTH

03:02:22.031 --> 03:02:23.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ISSUES WHICH ARE OFTEN DIRE AND

03:02:23.866 --> 03:02:25.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACUTE FOR SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS

03:02:26.035 --> 03:02:27.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO KEEP

03:02:27.436 --> 03:02:29.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM FOR TREATMENT THAT IS BOTH

03:02:29.371 --> 03:02:31.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH.

03:02:31.373 --> 03:02:32.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WITH THAT I THINK I WILL

03:02:32.608 --> 03:02:32.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
CLOSE.

03:02:34.276 --> 03:02:34.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
I THINK.

03:02:34.510 --> 03:02:36.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:02:36.312 --> 03:02:37.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

03:02:39.448 --> 03:02:41.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THIS WEEKEND WAS A BOOK BY

THOUSAND FACES.

03:02:44.253 --> 03:02:45.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

RIGHT HERE WITH US HERE ON THE

03:02:52.127 --> 03:02:53.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

A THE CRISIS.

03:05:32.321 --> 03:05:34.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS THE NEED TO GO IN A DIRECTION

WHERE WE CUT BACK FROM CIVIL

EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:05:40.963 --> 03:05:43.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HERE IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE

PROTECTIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS

03:05:45.834 --> 03:05:47.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

SELF DIRECTING.

03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:54.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE WOULD SUGGEST CERTAINLY

03:05:54.142 --> 03:05:57.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT LPS HAS SERVED FOR DECADES

03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:59.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT BALANCE THAT'S BEEN

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:00.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ESSENTIAL.

03:06:00.849 --> 03:06:03.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BETWEEN INVOLUNTARY CARE AND

03:06:03.752 --> 03:06:07.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TREATMENT AND THE ABILITY OF.

03:06:07.656 --> 03:06:09.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE SELF

LIVES.

03:06:11.827 --> 03:06:14.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE I THINK

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:15.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

03:06:15.163 --> 03:06:16.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:06:16.131 --> 03:06:17.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSULTANT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB

03:06:17.566 --> 03:06:18.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ON THIS ANALYSIS AND I

03:06:18.634 --> 03:06:20.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OFTENTIMES

03:06:20.235 --> 03:06:22.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THESE ARGUMENTS GET LOST HERE

03:06:22.704 --> 03:06:23.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

03:06:23.338 --> 03:06:27.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT CAN BE THE THE EMOTIONS

03:06:27.609 --> 03:06:29.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND THE WHAT ARE ALWAYS THE

03:06:29.211 --> 03:06:30.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HEART WRENCHING?

03:06:30.479 --> 03:06:33.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STORIES THAT THAT WE HEAR BUT

03:06:34.016 --> 03:06:36.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT TO AYE I THINK THE ANALYSIS

03:06:36.318 --> 03:06:39.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DID KEEP THE FOCUS ON EXACTLY

03:06:39.087 --> 03:06:39.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WHAT.

03:06:39.321 --> 03:06:40.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:06:40.889 --> 03:06:42.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LPS DOES WHAT IT HAS

03:06:42.824 --> 03:06:45.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HISTORICALLY DONE AND WHY IT HAS

03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:47.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL.

03:06:47.829 --> 03:06:50.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

03:06:50.365 --> 03:06:51.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:06:52.034 --> 03:06:53.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOOK A LOOK AT THIS A FEW YEARS

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:55.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGO WITH THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

03:06:57.472 --> 03:06:59.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THAT'S LAURA'S LAW.

BEING RAISED.

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:10.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE

03:07:15.490 --> 03:07:17.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:19.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTIONS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE

RESOLVING AND GETTING.

03:07:24.199 --> 03:07:26.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK SOME CONSENSUS ON THIS

03:07:26.735 --> 03:07:28.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ISSUE WE HAVE NOT HEARD UP
FRONT.

03:07:28.737 --> 03:07:31.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW MANY PEOPLE WE ARE TALKING

ABOUT THE THE TESTIMONY TODAY

03:07:33.408 --> 03:07:35.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LED US TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:36.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

03:07:36.845 --> 03:07:39.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDIVIDUALS BOTH AND LA AND AND

03:07:39.214 --> 03:07:40.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
STATEWIDE?

03:07:40.415 --> 03:07:43.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT IS

FOLKS ARE BUMPING UP AGAINST.

03:07:45.687 --> 03:07:48.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THAT PRECLUDES

03:07:48.090 --> 03:07:50.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

03:07:50.092 --> 03:07:51.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

THE COURTS WHERE IS THAT
BARRIER.

03:07:56.765 --> 03:07:58.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND AND I THINK WHAT IS MOST

03:07:58.533 --> 03:07:59.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE'RE HERE

03:07:59.968 --> 03:08:02.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERY DAY SUGGESTING THE PROBLEM

03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:06.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS ONE THAT THERE IS NOT HOUSING

03:08:06.375 --> 03:08:06.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THERE IS NOT ADEQUATE

03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:07.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TREATMENT.

03:08:07.676 --> 03:08:10.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT'S

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:12.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WE

03:08:12.314 --> 03:08:13.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:15.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ASSURING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR

03:08:15.684 --> 03:08:16.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE

03:08:17.019 --> 03:08:18.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

03:08:18.854 --> 03:08:20.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ENSURING THAT THERE IS.

03:08:20.489 --> 03:08:22.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE CARE AND TREATMENT WE WOULD

03:08:22.724 --> 03:08:24.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
URGE YOUR.

03:08:24.092 --> 03:08:27.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

POVERTY.

03:08:31.199 --> 03:08:32.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE DO BELIEVE THAT AB AND

03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:34.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IS COMING

03:08:34.302 --> 03:08:35.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FROM A GENUINE DESIRE TO

ALLEVIATE THE GROWING CRISIS OF

HOMELESSNESS.

APPROACH.

03:08:40.709 --> 03:08:42.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YET WE AGREED THAT THERE ARE

03:08:42.077 --> 03:08:43.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREET BUT

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:45.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE NOT ALL DYING FOR LACK

03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:46.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

THEM ARE DYING FOR BASIC

03:08:47.916 --> 03:08:49.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS BECAUSE

03:08:49.151 --> 03:08:50.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:51.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:02.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FACT WHEN THE GOLDEN ONE

WHATEVER.

03:12:41.016 --> 03:12:43.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTION LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:45.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO TAKE IN THIS AREA ARM AND

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:47.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE SUFFICIENTLY COMPELLING

03:12:47.355 --> 03:12:49.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SATISFIED BY.

03:12:52.928 --> 03:12:55.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN A HUMANE IMPULSE OR DESIRE

03:12:55.363 --> 03:12:56.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
NOT TO SEE

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:59.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
BUT ON THE STREETS.

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:01.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:08.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I BELIEVE THIS GOES TOO FAR FOR

03:13:09.044 --> 03:13:10.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HELPING CLIENTS.

03:13:10.478 --> 03:13:11.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT I BELIEVE NOW IS SET?

03:13:11.212 --> 03:13:13.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF I WAS SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL.

03:13:13.682 --> 03:13:15.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I WAS LIVING ON THE STREETS

03:13:15.283 --> 03:13:16.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I HAVE THE FEELING THAT I WOULD

03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:17.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BE LOCKED AWAY IN A JAIL

03:13:17.719 --> 03:13:18.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMEWHERE.

03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:20.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT

03:13:20.388 --> 03:13:22.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THIS

03:13:22.390 --> 03:13:24.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
DREAMY DISCLOSE A BRIDGE TOO
FAR.

03:13:24.125 --> 03:13:27.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTED THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

03:13:27.329 --> 03:13:28.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'M ON MEDICINE NOW I'M ON

03:13:28.697 --> 03:13:30.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROZAC IT WORKS FOR ME BUT IT

03:13:30.932 --> 03:13:32.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND

03:13:32.467 --> 03:13:34.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PEOPLE DON'T. DE MISDIAGNOSIS

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:35.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
THINGS.

03:13:35.770 --> 03:13:37.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I BEEN THERE. AND I UNDERSTAND

03:13:37.105 --> 03:13:38.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
OUT.

03:13:38.807 --> 03:13:41.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME IS

03:13:41.643 --> 03:13:42.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE GAME IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

03:13:42.544 --> 03:13:43.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND I HAD TERRIBLE SEVERE

03:13:43.745 --> 03:13:45.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
REACTIONS TO IT.

03:13:45.714 --> 03:13:46.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND THEN THEY WOULD GO AND

03:13:46.648 --> 03:13:48.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
INEVITABLY GO BACK.

03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:50.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SELECT QUESTION REALLY IS IS

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:53.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THIS REALLY ABOUT.

03:13:53.488 --> 03:13:55.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
PUBLIC SAFETY.

03:13:55.457 --> 03:13:58.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND NOT ABOUT HOUSING.

03:13:58.193 --> 03:14:01.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE

03:14:01.129 --> 03:14:03.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE PEOPLE

03:14:03.932 --> 03:14:04.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON THE STREETS AND MARK BECAUSE

03:14:04.833 --> 03:14:06.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU DON'T SEE THEM ANYMORE.

03:14:06.901 --> 03:14:08.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR JUST REALLY ABOUT HELPING

03:14:08.336 --> 03:14:10.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE AND IF HE AND AS THE GUY

03:14:10.839 --> 03:14:11.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM THE SEAL YOU SAID HE HAD TO

03:14:11.906 --> 03:14:13.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PUT POINT ABOUT HOUSING. WE

03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:14.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING.

03:14:14.376 --> 03:14:15.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THIS IS AGAIN TAKING AWAY

03:14:15.243 --> 03:14:17.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

03:14:17.212 --> 03:14:17.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO HAVE A HOME TO LIVE IN.

03:14:17.912 --> 03:14:19.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

03:14:19.681 --> 03:14:21.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIX

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:22.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TREATMENT WE SHOULD REALLY FIX

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:24.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:14:24.619 --> 03:14:26.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT'S A MESS IS IT IS NOW.

03:14:26.721 --> 03:14:28.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY

03:14:28.189 --> 03:14:30.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEED BECAUSE THE FACT IS DATA

03:14:30.225 --> 03:14:32.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

DID I THINGS WERE TREATMENT.

03:14:46.875 --> 03:14:48.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
