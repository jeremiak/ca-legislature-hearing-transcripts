THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE NOW MOVING ON TO OUR HEARING. AT TODAY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED JUST LAST MONTH. TITLED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL THE STATE'S POOR MANAGEMENT OF THE EXIDE CLEANUP PROJECT HAS LEFT CALIFORNIANS. AT CONTINUED RISK OF LEAD POISONING. AFTER THE PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THIS AUDIT WE WILL HAVE A BRIEF FOLLOW UP ON THE STATUS OF RECOMMENDATIONS. MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN A REPORT FROM LAST YEAR. FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO FOR REQUESTING THIS ON IT REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXITE CLEAN UP. IT'S CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THIS TOPIC ABOUT IT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU AND SO MANY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS NOT TO MENTION THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FIFTEEN ACRE FACILITY IN VERNON. PROCESS TO LEAD ACID BATTERIES AND OTHER LEAD BEARING MATERIALS TO RECOVER LAD AND OTHER MATERIALS UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. ROSS IS ABOU ELEVEN MILLION USED TO LEAD ACID BATTERIES EACH YEAR. IN THE PROCESS EXIDE CONTAMINATED THE AIR AND SOIL IN AND AROUND THE CITY OF VERNON. ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CONTAMINATED AREA AND ARE AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO LEAD CONTAMINATED SOIL. AS WE KNOW EXPOSURE TO LEAD CAN CAUSE SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING BRAIN DAMAGE MEMORY LOSS. REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS INCLUDING DEATH. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC. SUBSTANCE CONTROL HAS BEEN WORKING TO IDENTIFY LEAD CONTAMINATION AND WORDS PRESENT TO REMOVE IT FROM RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES CHILD CARE CENTERS PARKS AND SCHOOLS. NOT A REPORT CERTAINLY RAISES QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THE CLEAN UP OF THE LAD INCLUDING WHITE CHILD WHY CHILD CARE CENTERS PARKS SCHOOLS HAVE NOT BEEN CONSISTENTLY PRIORITIZED WHETHER WILL CLEAN UP THE PROPERTIES WITHIN THE TIME FRAME IT'S SET AS ITS GOAL. AND THE INCREASING COST OF THE CLEANUP. ALTHOUGH NOT DIRECTLY COVERED IN THE ON REPORT I'M SURE THE RECENT BANKRUPTCY OF EXCITED CAN ONLY ADD TO THE FRUSTRATION. COMPLEXITY AND THE COST OF THE CLEANUP. OF TODAY'S HEARING WILL PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A LITTLE CLARITY TO THESE ISSUES. AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRKTHE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL-SAFETY OF TOXICS MATERIALS TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS. AND THEN JUST DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINT US THE MEMBERS IF THEY WANT TO- THEY WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THEIR QUESTIONS SINCE WE NEED TO BE OUT OF THE ROOM BY TWELVE THIRTY SURE. MISTER CORK. THANK YOU. FOR IN READING THE ALRIGHT REPORT- QUITE A BIT OF A BILLS WITH THE FACT THAT. HELLO TIME IT TOOK A LOT MORE TIME AND MONEY I THINK PARTLY THAT WAS BECAUSE ONE OF CONTRACTORS REALLY JUST DIDN'T PERFORM. BOB BUT WHAT THE- RIGHT ONE OF TOXIC MATERIALS- THE SIZE OF THEIR RESPONSES- THEY ARE PARTICULARLY DURING ALL OF THE THINGS NOW THAT. THE COMMITTEE HAD THAT ADDED TO THEM OUR SUGGESTED INCLUDING LOWER PRIORITIZE AND- THE US DAYCARE CENTERS SARAH- BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY I'VE DONE DIFFICULT PROJECTS MYSELF AND YOU ALWAYS. DEL KNOW WHAT THE TIME SCALE WILL BUILD. GO GO AHEAD OF US- BURKE I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON AUDIO TO FORGET JUST HAVE THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS NOT SPEAK SO LOUDLY TO INTERRUPT THE HEARING THANK YOU. WORLD. I'LL TRY AND SPEAK LOUDER WELL THAT HELPS ALL RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE ONE YOU'RE STARTING A PROJECT WHICH NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE NO ONE'S DONE SOMETHING THIS MASSIVE IT'S VERY HARD TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT ON TIME. LOS I THINK THEY HAVE SLOWED DOWN LONG. BUT I DON'T ROOM. I DON'T TOTALLY BLAME THEM FOR NOT GETTING IT RIGHT GETTING THAT THAT OFTEN HAPPENS THE MAIN THING I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NOW IS WHAT WE DO IN THE FUTURE ARE THAT WE HAVE MORE REALISTIC ESTIMATES OF TIME AND COST. EFFECTIVE THANK YOU RISK WORK WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO A PANEL. TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS OUR FIRST PANEL THE OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX- SUBSTANCE CONTROL WITH US WE HAVE- MISS. ELAINE HOW ARE CALIFORNIA'S STATE AUDITOR AND MISTER- BOB HERE'S PRINCE WATER. WE CAN MOVE TO OUR WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM PLEASE. HOW DO I KNOW THAT. OKAY SO GOOD MORNING MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WE ISSUE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER A SALAS INDICATED JUST RECENTLY ON THE- EXCITE A TOXIC SUBSTANCE CLEAN UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE TWO KEY ISSUES IN THE AUDIT REPORT. ONE RELATED TO THE CASE OF THE CLEAN. ARE OCCURRING AT THE- VERY SITES AND THE COST OF THE CLEANUP SO I'M GONNA START WITH THE CLEAN UP OUR SCHEDULE AND WHAT WE CONCLUDED IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS A CLEAN UP OF LEAD CONTAMINATION- IS BEHIND SCHEDULE- THE- WHAT KIND OF TACTICS. CONTROL ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES WHICH THAT WERE THE MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES- BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT BASED ON THEIR PACE THUS FAR- AND THE NUMBER OF SITES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAN UP THE DAY WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH OUR CLEANING ALL THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN AS THE CHAIRMAN INDICATED THERE WERE SOME PROPERTIES- FIFTY PROPERTIES THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LEAD. CONTAMINATION THAT WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE PRIORITIZED IN THESE INCLUDED SCHOOLS CHILD CARE CENTERS AND PARKS. AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT EARLIER THIS YEAR. THERE WERE THIRTY ONE OF THOSE FIFTY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN CLEANED UP- MOST OF THEM BEING CHILD CARE CENTERS TWENTY SIX CHILD CARE CENTERS THREE PARKS. AND TWO SCHOOLS ALSO THOSE FACILITIES ARE THOSE SITES ACTUALLY ARE STILL NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. AND THE LEAD CONTAMINATION TO BE REMOVED AND AS YOU ARE YOU KNOW CONCERNED EYES. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO. NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT CHILDREN WHO FREQUENTLY CHILD CARE CENTERS AND THE PARKS AND CERTAINLY THE SCHOOLS ARE WHEN KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL- THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T YOU KNOW THE REASON THEY'RE BEHIND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY MASK PLAYING. UP THE REASON THEY'RE BEHIND IN. NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIRTY TWO HUNDRED SITES TO GETTING THOSE CLEANED UP BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY ACTUALLY HAD ESTIMATED THE PACE OF CLEANUP WOULD BE. BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE PROPERTIES PER WEEK AND THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED THAT THEY HIREDTO CONTRACTORS- AND NEITHER OF THOSE CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THAT CASE OF CLEANUP. AND EIGHT ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS THEY ACTUALLY- DECIDED TO HAVE THAT CONTRACTOR STOP CLEANING UP PROPERTIES BECAUSE THEY THEY COST OVERRUNS WERE JUST TOO SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. I TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT CONTRACTORS SO THE PACE HAS HAS DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY- EVEN THOUGH THEY ESTIMATED THE PACE TO BE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE. WE LOOKED AT A TIME FRAME PRIOR TO COPE IT BECAUSE CERTAINLY COVERED HAS HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO CLEAN PROPERTIES BUT WE LOOKED AT A TIME FRAME OF MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN TWO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. TO SEE WHAT THE PACE WISE AND THE PACE WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT TWENTY PROPERTIES PER WEEK SO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE PROPERTIES THEY WERE EXPECTING WOULD BE CLEANED UP. DURING THE COURSE OF THIS. CLEAN UP PROJECT AT THE PACE OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THEY THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A CLEANED UP BY- DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THAT IS- WELL ACTUALLY BY JUNE SO IF THEY STICK WITH THE TWENTY PROPERTIES PER WEEK. THEY WILL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEANED UP OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED BY DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT BECAUSE THEY- HAD A CEASE AND DESIST BASICALLY WOULD WANT TO CONTRACTORS THE PACE NOW IS EVEN DROP DOWN EVEN FURTHER IT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN PROPERTIES. PER WEEK AND NOW THAT PUSHES THE CLEAN UP COMPLETION OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES OUT TO. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THINGS ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT FURTHER AND FURTHER BECAUSE OF THE PACE- JUST NOT ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED WHEN THEY- THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. ALL THE PROPERTIES THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP. SO THAT'S A SIX. COMES NOW WHY IS THIS HAPPENING I MENTION ONE THING WHERE- THEY HAD TO HAVE ONE CONTRACTOR BASICALLY CEASE AND DESIST WORK. ON THE OTHER ISSUE IS THEY DIDN'T. ENFORCE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT WERE IN THE CONTRACTS AS FAR AS PASTE. UP FOR CLEAN UP. SO THAT THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED- THAT SINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE. AND PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE CLEAN UP THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING THUS FAR. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED IN THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS THIS THERE'S FORTY SIX HUNDRED. ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. ARE THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP THEY'RE NOT AS CONTAMINATED AS A THIRTY TWO HUNDRED BUT THEY STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION- AND THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A STRATEGY OR A TIMELINE FOR THERE'S FORTY SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES. SO THAT AGAIN. SKEWS ME THAT'S- THAT'S INFORMATION THAT- THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WELL ONCE WE GET THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED CLEANED UP. DO WE HAVE A STRATEGY OR TIMELINE FOR THESE OTHER FORTY SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LEAD CONTAMINATION. SO WE MADE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SCHEDULING. FIRST WE FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEED TO IMMEDIATELY SOLICITA CONTRACTOR TO WORK ON THOSE THIRTY ONE PROPERTIES DOES CHILD CARE CENTERS THE SCHOOLS AND THOSE PARKS THEY NEED TO GET THOSE- SITES CLEANED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THERE IS A- A PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN USE. IT'S CALLED TIME CRITICAL REMOVAL ACTION TO CRA AND THAT'S ACTUALLY AN EXPEDITED PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT COULD USE. TO GET THOSE THIRTY ONE SITES CLEANED UP- MORE MORE QUICKLY THAN THAN HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST SO THAT'S ONE RECOMMENDATION. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION IS OF COURSE THEY NEED TO IMMEDIATELY SOLICIT ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANUP BECAUSE ONE CONTRACTOR IS JUST NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH THAT PUSHES THE TIMELINE WAY TOO FAR OUT AND CONTINUES TO EXPOSE PEOPLE TO RISK OF LEAD POISONING. SO THEY NEED TO ACT TO GET ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS ON BOARD AND THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY DO INCLUDED THEY SHOULD INCLUDE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN THOSE CONTRACTS. THEY HOLD THE CONTRACTORS TO THOSE STANDARDS. AND THEN THE LAST- RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO. THE PACE OF CLEANUP WOULD BE BY SPRING OF NEXT YEAR TO REALLY GET TOGETHER INFORMATION. RELATED TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED BUT ALSO THE FORTY SIX HUNDRED AND GET THAT INFORMATION OUT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. CERTAINLY TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE NEXT STEPS AND WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AS FAR AS CLEANING UP. THE CONTAMINATED SITES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE UPDATED AT A MINIMUM EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR THE PUBLIC AND AGAINST THE LEGISLATURE. THE SECOND MAIN SECTION OF THE ART REPORT IS RELATED TO COST- AS MEMBERS ARE I'M SURE WELL AWARE THE LEGISLATURE. ARE PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT. TO CLEAN UP WHAT THE DEPARTMENT SOUGHT THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH WOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THOSE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED SITES WITH THAT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. HOWEVER IN LOOKING AT THE COST US FAR AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE EXPANDING TO CLEAN SITES ARE THAT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO FALL SHORT. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE A- TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE OUT OF THOSE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET CLEAN WAS AT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS AT LEAST ANOTHER TWENTY ONE MILLION. JUST FINISHED JUST THOSE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE PROPERTY SO THAT'S THE AT THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED. NOW AS- AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE FORTY SIX HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS LEFT. ON CONTAMINATION ON THEM SO. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCES BASED ON YOU KNOW PAST. HISTORY OF THE ESTIMATES FOR CLEANING PROPERTIES WILL NEED ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS SO THE TOTAL COST. TO CLEAN UP ALL OF THE CONTAMINATED SITES- DUE TO THE EXACT. UP THE EGGS I'D LET LET YOU KNOW CONTAMINATION AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VERNON AREA- WILL BE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- WHY WERE SOME OF THESE THESE ESTIMATES ARE TOO LOW- WE FEEL THAT THE DEPARTMENT TACTICS THERE WERE CERTAIN ELEMENTS CERTAINLY THAT ARE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL- BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE DEFINITELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING THE ESTIMATES TOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANY CONTRACT WHEN YOU'RE CONTRACTING WITH SOMEONE TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER PREVAILING WAGE YOU KNOW THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS TO COMPLETE. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED A FACTOR FOR INFLATION. AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE DID NOT SEE- AND THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WAS COMING UP WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY. RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE IT'S ARE ON AVERAGE ABOUT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY SO THERE CERTAINLY ARE THINGS THAT WERE NOT IN THEIR CONTROL WHETHER IT'S CETERA BUT THERE WERE THINGS LIKE PREVAILING WAGE AND INFLATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE CONSIDERED WHEN IT CAME UP WITH THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES. ON THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAD. WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS AS I MENTIONED THERE WAS THAT ONE CONTRACTOR. THAT THE DEPARTMENT- ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW ORDERED THEM TO STOP CONDUCTING WORK- AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT COST OVERRUNS WILL THAT CONTRACT. WAS FOR TIME AND MATERIALS RATHER THAN A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. IT WAS TIME AND MATERIAL SO THAT CONTRACTOR WENT OVER BUDGET BY ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT BASICALLY TOLD THEM TO STOP WORKING- SO WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE OF BEST PRACTICE IS A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT AT LEAST PERHAPS A HYBRID CONTRACT WERE CERTAIN COSTS ARE FIXED LIKE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE WE MENTION THAT NO REPORT. SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT DEPARTMENT CAN DO AND SHOULD DO ARE MOVING FORWARD SO WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT. IN THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS IDENTIFYING THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED HAS AYE SAID WE ESTIMATE THEY NEED ANOTHER TWENTY ONE MILLION. BUT ALSO THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE FOR THOSE REMAINING FORTY SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LEAD CONTAMINATION AS WELL. WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR FUNDING. TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE SPRING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS- AND IT NEEDS TO INCLUDE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY HIT OUR ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY- SO THEY NEED TO INCLUDE A RANGE OF OPTIONS FOR. FUNDING FOR FULL CLEAN P OR TRYING TO PRIORITIZE THE PROPERTIES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF LEAD CONTAMINATION. BASED ON THE EXPOSURE- TO THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THAT COMMUNITY. ALSO THERE THERE NEED TO BE OPTIONS PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ARE GOING FORWARD. I'M ALSO WE NEED WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY REVISED THEIR COST ESTIMATION METHODS TO ENCOMPASS THOSE FACTORS LIKE I. DISCUSSED YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER INFLATION YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT YOU YOU HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGES ALL SORTS OF THINGS. AND THEN AS I AS I RECENTLY INDICATED. WHEN THEY WHEN THEY- PUT TOGETHER CONTRACTS HOPEFULLY GET SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS TO ASSIST WITH THE CLEANUP. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONTRACTS ARE EITHER FIXED PRICE OR IF NOT FIXED PRICE. OUR HYBRID TYPE CONTRACT WHERE YOU HAVE SOME COSTS THAT ARE FIXED LIKE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- AND THEN PERHAPS OTHER COSTS ARE NOT FIX THEIR MORE VARIABLE. BUT AT LEAST IT'S A WAY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTROL THE COSTS A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFICIENTLY. OUR THAN WE HAVE DONE THUS FAR. SO THOSE. ARE HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS KEY RECOMMENDATIONS I WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS BOB HARRIS IS HERE MISTER HARRIS WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER THE PROJECT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. A HE HAS THE DETAILS AND HOPEFULLY. HE'LL BE ABLE TO A SYSTEM I HAVE NO DOUBT AND ANSWERING MANY OF THE QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HALF. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHERYL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTER MONITOR WE APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW AND LAYING THE GROUNDWORK THERE I SHOULD- INFORM EVERYONE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT. WE DO HAVE- MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING WEARING MASKS I LIKE TO THINK- NOT ONLY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK. CHAIRMAN YES YEP FOR BEING HERE BUT SOME ARE MORE LOCK. SOMEONE MEMBER SANTIAGO ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA WHOSE PRESENCE. AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTICIPATING- REMOTELY MEMBERS FROM THE SENATE AND FROM THE ASSEMBLY. IN A REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WITH THAT MADAM. AUDITOR LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I GOT MY NOTES RIGHT. SO THERE'S SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PROPERTIES OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND PROPERTIES THIRTY TWO HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED. RIGHT IN A FIGHT AS MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES WHICH THE LEGISLATURE SET ASIDE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO CLEAN UP BUT BY YOUR ESTIMATES. THAT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL COME UP SHORT- BY APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET TO THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE PROPERTIES- BUT OVERALL. YOUR ESTIMATES ALSO THINK IN ORDER TO CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PROPERTIES WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION MORE DOLLARS. TO CLEAN UP THE REMAINING FORTY SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES OUTSIDE OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES. THAT'S CORRECT I GET THAT RIGHT. YES ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. GOT IT. AND THEN- AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A DIFFERENT THINGS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT- HAS THE DEPARTMENT AND RECEPTIVE THUS FAR RIGHT NOW WE START TO DO THE CHECK INS BUT HAVE THEY BEEN RECEPTIVE SO FAR OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN YOUR AUDIT REPORT. YES THEY THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY. HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THE AS I MENTIONED THERE WERE. CERTAIN FACTORS- THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE OUT OF THEIR CONTOL CERTAINLY WHETHER OR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT- WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE OTHER FACTORS. AND THE EXPERTISE OF THE DEPARTMENT WHERE THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF COMING UP WITH THEIR ESTIMATES. AGAIN BY INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE AND INFLATION THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BUT OVERALL. THE DEPARTMENT AGREES WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND INTENDS TO UP FULLY IMPLEMENT THEM. GREAT THANK YOU BETTER WATER LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS HERE ON THE DYESS- SENATOR MORE LOCK AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES- HELLO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I AM JUST CURIOUS IF YOU COULD START FROM THE BEGINNING A LITTLE BIT JUST TO BUILD THE WHOLE CASE OF THE CITY OF VERNON I HAVE ONLY HAS THREE HUNDRED AND ONE RESIDENTS AND- IT DOES NOT PROBABLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO. REPAIR ALL THE HOMES AND PROPERTIES IN THE VICINITY- I'M JUST CURIOUS- ABOUT THE PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST HAVE SAID OKAY WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE VERNON CANNOT THE NEIGHBORING CITIES CANNOT. AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES CANNOT SO THERE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL TAKE CARE OF IT SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE IS- SINCE THE STATE IS TAKING ON THIS OBLIGATION HOW DOES IT SOBRE GATOR GET REIMBURSED. AND IF IT KIND OF FELL IN THE STATE'S LAP. THEN WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR URGENCY AND WHO'S PUSHING US AND HOW'S- THIS GOING TO GET RESOLVED. AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AFTER MAYBE THAT BIG BROAD INTRODUCTION. SEARCHERS JR COURT- MY NAME'S BOB HARRIS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED EARLIER I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER ON ASSIGNED IT SO LET ME LET ME TRY AND- DO THAT BACKING UPAND- EXPLAIN KIND OF HOW WE GOT STARTED IN AND- TAKING A STAB COMING UP THESE PROPERTIES- SEVERAL ACCURATE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT. THERE IS THERE WAS THE EXPECTATION THAT WHEN THE STATE BEGAN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AROUND THE EXIT FACILITY. THAT THERE WOULD BE REIMBURSEMENT FROM EXCITED ACTUALLY- WHILE IT WAS PURSUING CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES DGSE WAS ALSO PURSUING ACTIONS AGAINST EXIDE TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTAMINATION. AND EVENTUALLY TO- GET FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE CLEAN UP RIGHT TO MAKE THEM FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE- THE STATE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE RESIDENTIAL CLEAN. UP WHILE THAT PROCESS WAS ON GOING. AND DID APPRPRIATE AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE DOLLAR. TO THAT AT. NOW AS CHAIR INICATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING THAT HAS BEEN THROWN INTO- SOME QUESTION NOW THAT EXACT HAS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAS APPROVED A BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT THAT DOES NOT. COMPENSATE CALIFORNIA FOR THE CLEAN UP COSTS AND OF THE STATE INTENDS ON APPEALING THAT DECISION BUT OUR CONCLUSION IS MOSTLY AFTER OUR AUDIT WAS ALREADY OVER THAT THAT ALL THAT HAPPENED BUT OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE WILL. SUCCESSFULLY RECOUP ITS COSTS- FOR CLEANING UP THESE RESIDENTIAL SITES. SO THEN- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TAKING ON THIS CASE VOLUNTARILY AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND SO THEN WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOPS HOW DOES THE LEGISLATURE. OTHER THAN AT AN AUDIT OF THIS NATURE HOW DOES THE LEGISLATOR INSERTED ITSELF TO SAY HEY DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW STAY ON SCHEDULE OR WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GET MORE FUNDING. PUT OUT MORE BIDS. YOU KNOW WHO WHAT WHY. WHY ARE WE HERE WHO WHAT IS THE BUCK STOP WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING HIS DEPARTMENT TO STAY ON TRACK AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO GET REPORTS LIKE THIS. M. AND M'S HOW KNOWS I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE BUT IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW EVERY TIME YOU GUYS PUT OUT A REPORT YOU JUST WANT TO CRY IT. HOW THE STATE'S BEING MANAGED SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. THERE IT IS IT IS WHAT'S A LEGISLATIVE HEARING AND I DO TO HELP GET THIS DONE. WELL CERTAINLY. HEARINGS CAN HELP HOLD ACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR- RESPECTIVE ACTIONS IN THIS CASE THE CHASSIS AND THE CLEAN UP EFFORT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLORE IS THAT WE DO NOW DTS IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO COMPLETE THE CLEANUP EFFORT. THAT FUNDING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL IN ONE FELL SWOOP AND THEN FIND OUT A COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW THAT IT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH- WE RECOMMEND THAT. DGSE PRESENT THE LEGISLATURE WITH A DIFFERENT A RANGE OF OPTIONS FOR WHAT FUTURE FUNDING COULD LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE COULD BE A SHORTER TIME FRAME NOT NOT TO SAY THAT. LEGISLATORS RENEGING ON ITS COMMITMENT TO CLEAN THESE PROPERTIES BUT JUST TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S MANAGING THE CLEAN UP EFFORT THERE THE- THE LENGTH OF TIME THE FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO LAST FOR WOULD BE A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME PERHAPS ONLY. AN ADDITIONAL FISCAL YEAR PASSED WITH THEIR CURRENT APPROPRIATION- CARRIED OUT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO- HAVE MORE FREQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH DGSE ABOUT HOW THE CLEAN UP EFFORT IS GOING. WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH THAT FUNDING AND WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY AND WHY IF ANY NEW CONDITIONS OF INTRODUCED THEMSELVES. THAT MAKES THE COST ESTIMATES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY PRESENTED NO LONGER VIABLE SO- THAT IS ONE POTENTIAL OVERSIGHT MECHANISM THE LEGISLATURE HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL. IN THIS HOUSE MENTIONED- TO CRITIC ACT COULD YOU REPEAT THE TITLE OF THAT. SURE AT THE TIME CRITICAL REMOVAL ACTION INTEGRA- WHICH THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN SPEAK PROBABLY MORE ELOQUENTLY TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF WHY BUT IS AN EXPEDITED- CLEAN UP EFFORT- THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO TREAT EACH EYE SIGHT AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT- AND STREAMLINE SOME OF THE EFFORTS TO CLEAN THOSE- RESIDENTIAL SITES. CONTROL JUST INTERRUPT WHAT SECRETARY DOES THIS DEPARTMENT REPORT TO. I DON'T RECALL OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I APOLOGIZE I DON'T RECALL. OKAY AND THEN THAT SECRETARY REPORTS OF THE GOVERNOR. OKAY IT'S- THE SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THANK YOU CALIFIA AND YES THAT WOULD BE A DIRECT REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU MR HURST THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT THANK CENTER MORLOCK- LET ME JUST REMIND MEMBERS WE NEED TO BE OUT OF THE ROOM BY TWELVE THIRTY I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE PERMIT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL WITH THAT LET'S MOVE TO. SOME MEMBER SANTIAGO. I. I APPRECIATE THAT MR JOURNAL BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS- I MEAN THERE'S A DEEP LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION IS AS YOU KNOW WHEN WE REQUESTED THE AUDIT- AND I PURCHASED IT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ACTUALLY TAKING IT UP AND MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR IT TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IS MORE LIKE AN OTHERS WHO SUPPORTED ON THE COMMITTEE- BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A- I WANT ANSWER QUICK QUESTION THAT YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT YOUR WORLD COULD BE RE. RE- A RECOUP THE DOLLARS AND- WHAT WHEN THE DOLLARS ARE FIRST SET UP- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WAS ALSO- IN THEIR LANGUAGE. THAT ROUTE THA SAID THAT WE WOULD GO AFTER ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTY SO THAT'S JUST A- PUT A PIN ON THAT. THAT THERE ARE BUT MAYBE OR MAYBE OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TO CONTAMINATION- THAT WE WOULD SEEK A REFUND FROM NOT JUST IN ADDITION TO EXCITE. EXCITE HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE. SITUATION GOING THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY COURT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE EVERY LEGAL TOOL POSSIBLE- TO CONTINUE. FIGHTING EXCITED HOLDING THOSE ACCOUNTABLE POLLUTER COMMUNITIES. BUT BUT HAVING SAID THAT- YEAH WE'VE NOW SEEN PROBLEMS WITH THE T. S. C. R. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK IT IN NON. BUT I THINK. THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WOULD THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS WHAT. WHAT ADDITIONAL AUDITS WOULD WE NOT ASK- I THINK THE HEARING DOES CITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW IN WRITING FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE- ALLEGED IN THE PAST OF DTS YOU WORKING TOO SLOW TO CLEAN UP THIS NEIGHBORHOOD- AND WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN WE CAN IMPLEMENT. BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION HAS TO ARISE- BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT WE'VE KNOWN THE TAX YES HE HAS KIND OF DRAGGED ITS FEET ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE NUMBER ONE HAVING AN INTERN PERMIT BAKER FOR OVER THIRTY THREE THIRTY FIVE YEARS- BEFORE BEFORE IT WAS SHUT DOWN- IS A BIG PROBLEM. SO THE QUESTION HAS TO RISER IN INCOMPETENCE IN THE AGENCY- YOU HAVE TO ASK THAT RATED THAT THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THIS MAY BE A QUESTION THAT THE AUDITOR MAIL PINE ON- IS HERE WITH THEIR NEGLIGENCE- OR IS A CULTURAL- BECAUSE IF I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE- ALL RIGHT WHEN I WAS GETTING THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE GONE OUT TO THREE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS. I DO BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN MAKE A LIST OF THOSE BEFORE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'VE SEEN THE SAME PROBLEMS TO PERSIST. OVER AND OVER. FOR SOME POINT TIME WE'VE GOT TO ASK IS IT. IS IT COMPETENCE- IS A CULTURAL. OR NEGLIGENCE CAN WE POINT THE FINGER TO. THE TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE OF IT. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW A YEAR FROM NOW I CONTINUE IN THAT THE ASSETS IN QUESTION NOT GRANTED I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. ALSO IT'S NOT FAIR TO LAY- ALL THOSE QUESTIONS- BEFORE THAT PERSON BUT WE MIGHT. BUT DO YOU HAVE A HINT- WHAT THAT WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD POINT THAT IF YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK IF YOU ARE ANSWERING THE QUESTION. SO CERTAINLY WE WERE REGIONAL. COMPETENCY OR OR- INTEGRITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING THE PROJECT AND WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING SO IN GOOD FAITH- OR WITH THE RIGHT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE- WE'RE POINTING TO CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE PLANNING OF THE PROJECT AND THEN THE MONITORING OF THE PROJECT THE PLANNING WITH RESPECT TO THE COST ESTIMATES AND EXPECT. HOW FAST THE CLEANUP WOULD PROGRESS AND THEN THE MONITORING TO ENSURE THAT THINGS WERE ACTUALLY GOING AT THAT COST AND GOING AT THAT SPEED OF CLEAN UP SO THOSE THOSE PROJECT MANAGEMENT- AREAS IF THE DEPARTMENT PAYS ATTENTION TO THOSE NOW- STAYS ON TOP OF DEVELOPING A SOUND COST ESTIMATE MAKING SURE THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT CONTRACTED STAFF IN THE FIELD TO CONDUCT CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES AT THE RIGHT PACE AT THE EXPECTED PACE. THEN THIS PROJECT WILL PROGRESS- OR IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS IN THE FUTURE THAN IT HAS UP TO THIS POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN PHILIP. PLACEMENT SANTIAGO FOR. AND I WAS IN MEANING TOWARDS A PERSON COULD BE UNFAIR FOR ME TO ASK IF THERE WAS A PERSON WHO YOU THOUGHT ANY OF THOSE THREE. ATTRIBUTES AND CAROLINE WITH I WAS MORE MENTIONING AS AN AGENCY- BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND- BUT I LOOK AT REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE I DON'T KNOW- MY COLLEAGUE ALSO REPRESENT TO NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ALSO IMPACTED- BUT WE'VE GOT TO ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE WANT OUR- BECAUSE- WE HAVE. WE SET SOME MONEY ASIDE. WE WANT TO CLEAN UP. AND IT'S NOT AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE HERE YOU'LL PEOPLE'S HEALTH ARE AT RISK. PEOPLE COULD DIE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS AND. WE SHOULD- IS ALARMING. THE STATE TO SETTLE THE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT NOW WITH THAT THAT THAT THIS DEPARTMENT NOT FUMBLED THE CLEAN UP OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVE NOT TAKEN BASIC UNDERSTANDINGS YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT ASK A QUESTION. YOU'VE GOT TO ASK THE QUESTION IS IT CAN. WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THIS BESIDES AGREED TO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS COULD WE CAN'T SIT HERE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW OR A YEAR FROM NOW WILL THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER. AND I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE QUESTION MAY BE UNFAIR BUT BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR AN OPINION FROM YOU OR THE STATE AUDITOR. RIGHT AGAIN AND- WE MAKE NO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT. THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT BEING THE CAUSE FOR THAT THE CLEANUP EFFORTS TO FISH THAT WE OBSERVED I CERTAINLY. IN A SYMPATHIZER STAND WHY- WE DON'T WANT TO BE ASKING THE SAME SET OF QUESTIONS A YEAR FROM NOW TWO YEARS FROM NOW. ABOUT THE SAME KINDS OF PROBLEMS AGAIN. TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW TO HOLD THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE I THINK. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS WELL POSITIONED TO DO SO THAT THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LONG PERIOD OF TIME ANOTHER LONG STRETCH OF TIME DURING WHICH CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES ARE NOT PROGRESSING. THE WAY THEY'RE EXPECTED TO CERTAINLY THE MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE REGULAR FREQUENT CHECK INS WE WILL ALSO BE FOLLOWING UP- THROUGH OUR REGULAR PROCESS ON. THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE AND SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC- AS TO WHETHER THIS CORRECTIVE ACTION IN FACT OCCURRING. THE FIRST ONE WILL BE DO- IN ABOUT A MONTH. GREAT THANK YOU AND THAT SUMMER SANTIAGO I KNOW A LOT OF US HERE'S YOUR FRUSTRATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE SET ASIDE FUNDING ALREADY TO CLEAN UP THE SITES OF THE HERE THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PRIORITIZE FOR CLEAN UP. BUT THAT'S I THINK THE VALUE OF HAVING THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THEN THAT THROUGH PROGRESS INTO THE NEXT YEAR ARE BUDGET SUB HEARINGS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY IT WILL THEN- GARCIA. THANK YOU HAVE A TO A QUICK QUESTION. THE ESTá. BECAUSE RIPPING UP IN. THE THIRTY ONE. I HAVE. CITED CHRIS. PARKS AND- I. IN THE AUDIT OR IS THAT. IN ADDITION COST. THEY ARE INCLUDED. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL.

YASSER TOOK ITS TO FIND EVENT VERY. SO I'M JUST GLAD WERE ADDING ATTENTION IN THE TOWN OF HERE- THE- I HAVE IS ON- PAGE TWO OF THE ORDER. JUST QUICK I KNOW WE HAVE LOT FOR DTS. ASIDE FROM THIS I DON'T THE STATE AUDITOR OR OF DUE TO YOU CAN. BUT IT'S STATES HERE THAT THE TNC BELIEVES IT HAS PROP MORE. THANK KALRA. YOU KNOW WATCH. WHAT ARE THOSE COME. YOU KNOW FRAUD THAT DTS BELIEVE. IT IS THAT SAME PACE ACT. SO A LOT OF. SHARE MORE. BUT IT SURE WITH US FOR- TOWARDS END OF OUR PRIDE. A COMPARISON TO OF OUT OR FOUR OTHER CLEAN UP- THE- YEAH. THERE WAS ONE OF THE IT WAS MY SICK. AND SO THE WERE. ARGUABLY QUITE AS- WITH RICK TO SIGN- AND DATA IT SURE WITH US WHICH IT WE DID NOT HAVE AN- TO VALLEY- SO WE'RE NOT STANDING BEHIND IT BUT IT DID PURPORT TO SHOW THAT THE TSC IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF THE CLEAN UP PROJECT. THIS PARTICULAR EXACT CLEANUP PROJECT HAS PROGRESSED FASTER THAN THOSE OTHER CLEANUP PROJECTS HAD- AGAIN. WE'RE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO VALIDATE THAT THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK LOOK AT DURING THE AUDIT AND IT WAS PRESENTED TO US RELATIVELY LATE. I WOULD LIKE TO DEPART SPEAKING SO. TO THAT QUESTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN HAVE JUST ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP AS WELL I THINK WE'LL LEAVE THIS TO THE NEXT BUT I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE SAME SENTENCE THAT MENTIONS- DIDN'T IN. AS WELL BACK THAT SLOW ITS RATE PROGRESS SO JUST TO BE MESSAGING SEEMS TO BE. GROWING IT FEELS THAT SEEMS LIKE DGSE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ALL PART IT ALSO INTO OF. CAUSES AN ISSUE THAT HAVE SLOWED DWN- HAVE YOU CAN LEAVE BUT THIS PART OF THE IS ONE OF THE- THANK YOU. TO UP I'LL LET THE AGAIN SPEAK THAT AT MORE SPECIFIC I KNOW THAT THEY FOR. CERTAIN CERTAIN FACTOR WERE- COULD NOT BE ANTICIPATED THAT AFFECTED THE OF CLAY UP- FOR OUR FIRST. THOSE FACTORS SUCH AS WHETHER OR A SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD WITH- THE OWNERS OF THOSE PROPERTIES THOSE WERE WELL NOT IN THE- AT THE MICRO LEVEL AT THE SITE BY SITE LEVEL ANTICIPATED- KEEP COULD BE ANTICIPATED. GENERAL FACTORS THAT SHOULD GENERALLY AFFECT THE OVERALL PACE AT WHICH YOU CAN PROGRESS WHICH SHOULD BE KNOWABLE IN ADVANCE YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WEATHER AND SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES OR THE TYPE OF TERRAIN THAT YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER AT A SITE. AGAIN YOU MAY NOT KNOW FOR A PARTICULAR SITE HOW MANY TREES ARE PLANTED ON THAT PIECE OF pYOU THEN HAVE TO WHAT WHICH MIGHT SLOW YOU DOWN BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOW. FROM A GENERALIZED PERSPECTIVE. THAT THERE ARE FACTORS WHICH WILL AFFECT THE OVERALL PACE SO THEY DON'T AMOUNT TO US. TO BE REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY. BERMAN COULD NOT MEET IT'S EXPECTED PACE OF CLEAN UP BECAUSE THOSE THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FACTORED IN AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE ESTIMATE WAS CREATED. RIGHT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS FOR THAT ANSWER AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS A CENTER GONZALO'S LAST QUESTION WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN REBEKAH BEAR QUE% HAN AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO CENTER DRAWS- IS JOINING US. THERE ARE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS. THAT MISS BAKER THEY ARE QUE HAND PLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WE'VE COVERED ALREADY. I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE COST OVER RUNS THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS IS TAKE AND MORE- BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT I WAS HOW OLD WAIT OUT. WHICH I THINK I WANT MORE CLARIFICATION ON WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THE IMPACT ON CHILDREN OF THIS CONTAMINATION IS SIGNIFICANT. AND I WANT UNDERSTANDS MORE FROM YOU MISTER HARRIS HOW THEY POSSIBLY COULD HAVE MISSED THOSE THIRTY ONE CHILD CARE CENTRE PARKS AND SCHOOL SITES WHERE WE KNOW CHILDREN ARE GONNA BE EXPOSED EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT SEEMS LIKE A HUGE OVERSIGHT AND SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT AND- ASKING REALLY. GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN AND HOW WE STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE AS WE MUST BE PROTECTING THOSE CHILDREN FOR THIS CONTAMINATION. EVERYTHING. IS GOING TO. HE WANTS THE- YOU KNOW THE AMERICAN. STRONG I THINK EUROPEAN. SO SIR THAT ONE OF THE THAT WE DID ONCE WE HAD THAT THESE PROPERTIES HAD BEEN CLEANED YET THIS FIGURE OUT TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT TOOK FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THIS ONE IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES AS PUBLICLY. OWNED NOW THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR SOME OF THEM BUT NOT TRUE FOR ALL OF THE PROPERTIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT- INITIALLY BELIEVED SO BAD INITIALLY OVER IDENTIFIED THE NUMBER THAT WERE PUBLICLY OWNED. THE REASON THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLICLY ON A PRIVATELY OWNED IS. IF IT'S A PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTY IT COULD CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC WORK UNDER STATE LAW. WHICH MEANS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS CONTRACTORS WOULD NEED TO BE BONDED AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND IN A CERTAIN WAY. IN THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPRESSED TO US THAT IT HAD DIFFICULTY. FINDING CONTRACTORS WHO WERE ABLE TO SATISFY THOSE REQUIREMENTS- WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT DELAY THEIR PROGRESS ON CLEANING THOSE PROPERTIES. THAT BEING SAID AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THEY HAD MISIDENTIFIED AS SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES AS PUBLICLY ON WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE PRIVATELY OWNED- AND- THEY IDENTIFIED. TWENTY FOUR OF THE CHILD CARE CENTERS WERE ACTUALLY PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL CHILDCARE CENTERS WHEN THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED THEY WERE PUBLICLY OWNED AND I'VE SENT TO SIGN THOSE TO. ONE OF THEIR CONTRACTORS TO CLEAN. BUT IT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AND WHY THERE WAS A DELAY IN CLEANING THESE PROPERTIES CERTAINLY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. HIGH PRIORITY- TO CLEAN WHICH IS WHY WE POINT OUT THAT THERE WERE OTHER PROCESSES THE DEPARTMENT COULD YOU SUCH AS THE TECH WRECK TO EXPEDITE THE CLEAN UP OF THOSE PROPERTIES. ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP SO ARE THEY DO WE KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT AYE WE CAST APARTMENT THIS I GUESS IS IN THE PROCESS OF USING TO GRANT TO GET THOSE FACILITIES CLEANED UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO EXPRESSED TO. US ABOUT IT THAT THEY ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT AND I'LL LET THEM KIND OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HARRIS. THANK YOU WOMAN WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO SENATOR TO RAZA. THANK YOU. CAN YOU SEE ME OR MY. NO BUT- I CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL WAIT A MINUTE. THAT HELP OKAY. THANK YOU I DON'T WANT DENTURES US SALAS AND WORK AND THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY WHO'S PARTICIPATING PUTTING THIS- THIS HEARING TOGETHER I JUST GOT ELECTED TO THE AREA WHERE THE IMPACT IS BEING FELT ON THE RESIDENTIAL AREA SO I WONDER YEAH I THINK THE EFFORT THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GARCIA AND SANTIAGO AND OTHERS- EASY ROWING OF JUST PUSHING AND PUSHING AND PUSHING. WHAT I AM AMAZED THAT IS THAT THESE ISSUES WHAT THIS DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. AND I KNOW TODAY WERE TRYING TO DO A SLICE OUT A PIECE OF HOW THEY HANDLED THE EXIDE. CLEANUP IN ALL THE ISSUES THERE BUT THIS IS A DEPARTMENT THAT. THAT THIS IS THEIR EXPERTISE. THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLING FOR DECADES AND NOW- WE'RE FINDING THROUGH YOUR AUDIT THAT THINGS AS SIMPLE AS HAVING ONLY ONE CONTRACTOR INSTEAD OF HIRING SEVERAL. THAT THAT THEN IMPACTS THE TIMING OF IT JUST SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS YEAH IT'S MIND BOGGLING UP BECAUSE THEY'RE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THESE IN THIS COMMUNITY OF COLOR. THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED WITH HEALTH ISSUES WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND IT SEEMS TO ME THIS AUDIT OUGHT TO. AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU IDENTIFY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW MASSIVE. THE MPACT AND THE DAMAGE AND THE SUFFERING ON THESE COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT CLEANUP OR LACK OF CLEAN UP WORK SLOW CLEANUP OF EXCITED SO. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE GET THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALSO GIVE THE PUBLIC AN UNDERSTANDING. OF THE DEVASTATION THAT THIS IS CAUSING CONTINUES TO CAUSE AS PART OF THE AUDIT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT APPEARS TO BE. THESE WERE STEPS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN. THERE HAVEN'T BEEN TAKEN AND NOW WE HAVE A PROMISE TO TAKE THEM. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH I DON'T MEAN THAT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE AUDIT BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HEAR IT IN THOSE TERMS. AND I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A MUCH DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS DEPARTMENT. THAT HAS LED TO THIS DAMAGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THAT WE- WE DO A DISSERVICE WHEN WE LEAVE THAT OUT OF THE STORY AND THE NEGATIVE. AND THE NARRATIVE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO- YOU KNOW I'VE THAT MAY SOUND A LITTLE BIT DRAMATIC TO SOME PEOPLE BUT- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AND NOTE FOR US TO GET THE RESURFACES JERRY I MEAN LOOK AT THIS THE FEDERAL. YOU KNOW TO ALLOW THIS COMPANY TO WALK AWAY WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT BACK AS CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITORS FOR ALL YOUR WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAW A I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE EVERY PROPERTY THAT IS NOT CLEANED UP AT THE FAMILY- THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THE MEDIA ACCOUNTS IN THE ACCOUNTS OF. THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED WITH CANCER- BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION AT THE SITE AND THE AGREEMENTS MADE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL FOR EXCITEMENT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO. PRIORITIZE THOSE FAMILIES AS PROPERTIES AND TO DO ALL WE CAN TO. MITIGATE THE SITUATION WITH THAT HEARING NUMBER QUESTIONS ON THE FIRST PANEL WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS COMMENTS IN RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL- WITH US WE HAVE- MEREDITH WILLIAMS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR. OF DGSE. FRANCISCA NEGRA- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. GRANT COPE WITH DEBBIE DIRECTOR- IN IF WE COULD JUST START WITH MISS WILLIAMS PLACE. I BELIEVE THE DIRECTOR IS JOINING US VIA THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOMS OF THE SWITCH BACK OVER TO THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM PLACE. THE MORNING ARE YOU READY FOR ME. PLEASE PROCEED. WARNING MY NAME IS MEREDITH WILLIAMS AND I AM THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORK ON THE OUTSIDE RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUDITOR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR WORK WITH US. WE'VE BEEN HEARING FOR A LONG TIME FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT HOW THIS. THIS PROJECT IMPACTS THEIR DAILY LIVES AND THEIR HEALTH. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THEM. THAT THE PROJECT GET DONE AND GET DONE RIGHT. THEY HAVE VERY MOVING STORIES AND THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS WORK. THIS IS THE LARGEST MOST COMPLEX MOST LOGISTICALLY COMPLEX CLEAN UP OF ITS KIND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CLEAN UPS OF THIS TYPE IN THE NATION. WE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL AS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE CLEAN UP. AND IT'S NOT BUT THAT'S NO COMFORT TO THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE FACILITY THAT HAVE HAD TO LOOK. WILL LIVE WITH THE CONTAMINATION WELL WE LEARNED AS WE WENT. AND WE HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL AND WHAT WE LEARNED IS EVIDENT IN THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN SPITE OF OUR CHALLENGES. WE'VE COMPLETED CLEANUP OF TWO THOUSAND NINETY SIX RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD. THIS AUDIT GIVES US ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. IT SHINES A LIGHT ON WHAT WE CAN IMPROVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS. THE SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO THE ORDERS RECOMMENDATIONS SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE PUT IN PLACE WITH CURRENT RESOURCES. TO PROTECT AGAINST SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN TO STRENGTHEN THE DEPARTMENT IN THE WAKE OF EXCISE. WITH RESPECT TO THE ORDERS RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CHILD CARE SCHOOLS DATE AND PART DAY CARE CENTERS. WE HAVE TAKEN IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO CONTINUE CLEAN UP AT THIS FACILITY. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE POINT WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME CRITICAL REMOVAL ACTIONS ARE TECH CROSS. THE DEPARTMENT DID DO SOME INITIAL WORK RELATED TO TAKE ROSE TO REMOVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AT THESE FACILITIES AND PUT BARRIERS IN PLACE TO PROTECT PEOPLE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM EXPOSURE. THAT SAID WE KNOW THERE ARE THERE WERE FIFTY FIVE DAY CARES THAT HAVE BEEN SAMPLED. TWENTY ONE OF THOSE HAVE BEEN CLEANED. AND ELEVEN DO NOT REQUIRE ANY CLEAN UP OR ARE NO LONGER OPERATING IS DAY CARE FACILITIES. THERE ARE TWENTY THREE DAY CARE FACILITIES THAT DO REMAIN TO BE CLEANED. DGSE HAS SAMPLED EACH OF THEM AND FOURTEEN ARE SCHEDULED TO BE CLEAN UP BY TWO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC SITUATION I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE ALL CLOSE TO SCHEDULING ANOTHER TWO OR THREE PROPERTIES- EVEN THIS WEEK. UNFORTUNATELY THREE OF THE DAY CARE FACILITIES HAVE DECLINED TO CLEAN UP. AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS AND TO PURSUE ORDERS OR WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP- THOSE PROPERTIES. I WILL SAY THAT THE DAY CARE FACILITIES OPENING CLOSE REGULARLY AND FIVE DAY CARE CENTERS RECENTLY OPENED AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD TO GET THESE PROPERTIES IN OUR QUEUE. OUR CLEAN UP OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE ORDERS SECOND RECOMMENDATION. OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO CLEANING UP THESE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS THAT POSE THE GREATEST RISK. OF EXPOSURE AS QUICKLY AND AS COST EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN. WE ARE WORKING TO CLEAN UP THESE PROPERTIES WITH THE SCHEDULE AS AGGRESSIVE AS COVERT ALLOWS. WE RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY OF THIS PROJECT WE'RE ON PACE TO COMPLETE MORE THAN 90% OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED CLEAN UPS AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. OVER DE TNCS FIRST SIX YEARS WE ARE VERGE TWENTY ONE PROPERTIES PER MONTH. AND I WILL COMPARE THAT TO THE CLEAN UP THAT THE ORDER REFERENCED THAT MISTER HARRIS REFERENCE THAT CLEAN UP WAS IN OMAHA NEBRASKA IT TOOK I BELIEVE IT TOOK SEVENTEEN YEARS. IN THE FIRST SIX YEARS OF THAT CLEANUP THEY AVERAGED ABOUT NINE PROPERTIES MONTHS WE'RE MUCH CLOSER TO TWENTY ONE PROPERTIES A MONTH. SO AND EVEN BY THE END OF LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAN UP NINETY PROPERTIES A MONTH WEATHER PERMITTING AND EVEN IN COOKING UNDER COVERT CONDITIONS WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO SEVENTY PROPERTIES A MONTH. WHEN THINGS LINE UP. THERE ARE SEVERAL BARRIERS THAT MAY STAND IN THE WAY OF US ATTAINING OUR GOAL. BUT SCHEDULING PROPERTIES IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LIMITING FACTORS. COBIT HAS MADE RESIDENTS VERY RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE IN. IT IS A PAIN IN THE CLEAN UP PROCESS. SO WE'VE INCREASED OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH FOR A NUMBER OF PROPERTIES IN THE QUEUE AT ALL TIMES. TO CONTINUE THE UP THE GAME THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CLEAN UP IS CONTINUOUS. THE CURRENT APPROPRIATION WILL NOT AS THE AUDITOR POINTED OUT BEACH SUFFICIENT TO CLEAN THE FULL THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO SECURE THE FUNDING NEEDED FOR THIS CRITICAL WORK. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PARCELS THEY CAN BE CLEANED UP WITH OUR CURRENT APPROPRIATION WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING. SIZE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE PROPERTY COVERT NINETEEN AND OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT- WE ARE HARD TO PREDICT IN IN ADVANCE. WE ARE SEEING ARE ALSO SEEING INCREASED IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE EXCESSIVE HEAT DAYS TO CONSIDER. WE'RE NOW EXPERIENCING DAYS WHERE WE HAVE TO SEND OUR CREWS HOME BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE SMOKE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE PROCESS REALLY ON. AND OF COURSE RAIN TO GET REMAINS UNPREDICTABLE. THE TOPICS OF RECOMMENDATIONS THREE AND FOUR ARE PLANNING AND FUNDING OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES BEYOND THOSE FOR WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE FUNDS. IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN OUR INTENT TO HOLD EXCITED COUNTABLE FOR THIS CLEAN UP BUT WITH THEIR MOST RECENT BANKRUPTCY WE ARE REGROUPING. WE ALWAYS HAVE WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO THIS CLEAN UP. FROM THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S INJECTION OF AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT. UPON TAKING OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY. IF THE PAN GIVEN THE PANDEMIC SO WE CAN'T BE SURE WHERE THE STATE'S FINANCIAL SITUATION WILL BE. AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. AND OF COURSE A NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ADDS ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES WILL IMPACT OUR ROADS OUR STATE SO CALIFORNIA'S FISCAL STATUS IS QUITE UNCERTAIN AND AS A RESULT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO SPECIFICS OF A PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW. FOR NEXT SPRING. YOUR LAST RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE INCORPORATE FIXED PRICE ELEMENTS IN ANY FUTURE CLEAN UP CONTRACTS. AS I NOTED THE DEPARTMENT ANIL CONTRACTORS HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT UNPRECEDENTED CLEANUP. THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS IS THAT THERE ARE IS A LOT OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY AND BECAUSE OF THIS IT WAS EVEN CHALLENGING TO GET MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS TO BID ON THIS PROJECT. BUT EACH PROPERTY IS UNIQUE WITH SIZE AND CONFIGURATION AND- SOMETIMES WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ME- THE SPECIFICS UNTIL WE BEGIN WORKING FOR INSTANCE ON COVERAGE OF BURIED UTILITY LINES. WE ARE LEARNING FROM THESE AND WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO ANTICIPATE THOSE IN SCHEDULING. AND I THINK WE CONSTANTLY REVISIT OUR ENGINEERS ESTIMATES IN OUR SCHEDULING ESTIMATES AND ARE MUCH MORE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN ATTAIN IT THIS TIME. AND AS I MENTIONED OTHER FACTORS COME IN PEOPLE HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR SCHEDULES. WE HAVE OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO THINGS DO REMAIN UNPREDICTABLE. IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE INCORPORATED A NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS TO CONTROL COSTS IN OUR CURRENT CONTRACTOR IS OPERATING UNDER A CONTRACT THAT DOES HAVE THIS FIXED PRICE ELEMENTS. BEFORE I CONCLUDE I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT EXCITING IN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF DGSE. AS I SAID WE'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL NOT ONLY FROM THIS CLEAN UP BUT ALSO FROM EXCITED BANKRUPTCY. WE'VE BEEN APPLYING WHAT WE LEARNED TO HOW WE'VE RIGHT INSPECT AND ENFORCE OUR PERMITS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE UP TO DATE PERMITS IN PLACE THAT MAKE IT CLEAR TO AN OPERATOR WHAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE AND THAT MEANS EXPECT THEM TO MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT EXCITES FINANCIAL ASSURANCE WAS INADEQUATE. IN RESPONSE TO SB SIX SEVENTY THREE WE'VE ALREADY PUT TOGETHER STRICTER. FINANCIAL ASSURANCE TESTS AND REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. AND WE'RE REVIEWING FINANCIAL ASSURANCE MECHANISMS. MORE FREQUENTLY FOR PERMITTED FACILITIES BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO EVEN FURTHER IN STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL ASSURANCE WE BEGAN TO PURSUE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THAT SIDE HAS MADE US A BETTER ORGANIZATION. EXIDE BANKRUPTCY SYMBOLIZES A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE WITH BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES ACROSS THE STATE MANY WITHOUT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. IT IS TIME FOR THE STATE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THAT AND TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE LUCK TOXIC LEGACY OF THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN THE TOXICS WE USE IN OUR EVERYDAY LIFESTYLES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. DGSE APPRECIATES THE INSIGHTS GAINED. FROM DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ORDER STAFF AND FROM THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR PROCESS. YOU BELIEVE THE PROCESS HAS PROVIDED WITH DGSE WITH INFORMATION WE WILL USE TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC. WHO LIVE AROUND THE FACILITY ARE IMPACTED IN THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES FROM EXPECT OPERATIONS WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I HAVE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NEDRY HERE TODAY AND ALSO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SITE MITIGATION AND READING MEDIATION GRANT CULT. THANK THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE US MONEY AND I DON'T KNOW IF- I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAD- MISS NAY GRAY AND- MISTER COPE BUT I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT. TO ASSIST YOU BUT NOT TO HAVE A PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME CORRECT. ALL WILL KNOW IT JUST ANSWER ANY. IF NEEDED FANTASTIC. IT WOULD BE GOOD START QUESTIONING AND I KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS TO AND I KNOW OF THE REASONS FOR- PROBABLY A SLOW RESPONSE JUST DEALING WITH THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF YOUR CONTROL LIKE PANDEMIC IN THE WILDFIRES. BUT LET ME JUST ASK NGUYEN TO THE PROPERTY START WONDER THE PROPERTY CLEAN UP START AND BEGIN. WE CAN'T UP PROPERTY IN TWENTY OH. IT THE CHECKERS WERE IN TWENTY. SIX SEVEN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE THE RESULT OF THE OF THE DAY CARES THE SCHOOLS ETCETERA THE RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP STARTED IN TWENTY. EIGHTEEN THANK YOU SERVICE OPRY PANDEMICS WE STARTED AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN YOU BEGAN CLEANING PROPERTIES AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT GOT IT AND IF YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITIZATION WE HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR AND FROM A NUMBER OF MEMBERS THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT PRIORITIZING THE CHILD CARE CENTERS A PARKS THE SCHOOLS- WHY WASN'T THAT DONE IS THAT BEING ADDRESSED NOW AND FOR THOSE. REMAINING CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE ARE WE CHILD CARE CENTERS PARKS AND SCHOOLS ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT TIME CRITICAL REMOVAL ACTION TO CAN EXPEDITE THE CLEANUP OF THOSE PROPERTIES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES WE ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS TO GET THOSE PROPERTIES CLEANED WE WILL USE TIME CRITICAL REMOVAL ACTIONS WHEN WE NEED TO THERE MAY BE SOME PROPERTIES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESORT TO THAT WE CAN JUST GET THEM IN THE QUEUE AND KEEP THINGS MOVING. ON WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR IN PLACE TO DO THOSE CLEANUPS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOTH OF THOSE WILL BE CLEANED BY. MARCH OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WE'RE WORKING HARD TO GET THE REMAINING FACILITIES THOSE REMAINING DAY CARES IN THE QUEUE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND BEGINTHOSE THOSE CLEANUPS AS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. GOT IT AND- ACCORDING TO MY NOTES HERE THERE'S- FIFTY PROPERTIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK TO CHILDREN. BUT SO FAR ONLY NINETEEN OF THOSE FIFTY HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP SO CAN WE EXPECT THE REMAINING OF THOSE TO BE. CLEANED UP BY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES ACTUALLY SINCE THE TIME OF THE REPORT WE'VE ALREADY. CLEANED ADDITIONAL PROPERTY SO TWENTY THREE HAVE NOW BEEN CLEANED UP. AND WE AGAIN WE HAVE FOUR WE ALREADY HAVE ACCESS AGREEMENTS HANNAH YEAH JULES IN PLACE WITH PROPERTY OWNERS. AND WE ARE WORKING TO GET AS MANY OF THOSE CLEANED UP BY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WE CAN. GOT IT AND IN ORDER TO HELP EXPEDITE SOME OF THE- THE CLEAN UP SHE ALSO MENTIONED- THE CONTRACTORS. UNLESS I WANT TO ASK IS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT SECURING ADDITIONAL CONTRACTORS AND I KNOW THE AUDITOR ALSO MENTIONED- HAVING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THOSE CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING OUR DEADLINES AND TIMELINES. TO CLEAN UP THESE PROPERTIES WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENT DOING TO HELP- CLEAN UP THESE PROPERTIES- QUICKER IF YOU IF YOU MAY. SO I THINK THE CONTRACT WE HAVE IN PLACE ANY C. HAS- THEY THERE ARE SMALL. BUT THEY REALLY AND THEN CELLS IN TERMS THEIR ABILITY TO GET THE PROPERTIES CLEANED. IN A TIMELY FASHION AND STAY WITHIN OUR COST REQUIREMENTS. AND SO WE'RE VERY SATISFIED WITH THEM WE ARE LIKELY TO SUBCONTRACT. AND HAVE THEM USES OVERSEE A SUBCONTRACTOR TO ADD ADDITIONAL. OUR CREWS OUT IN THE FIELD AND INCREASE OUR CAPACITY. FOR CLEAN UP AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION. ENTERING INTO NEW CAR IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING AND GIVEN THE MOMENTUM WE HAVE WITH THE CURRENT CONTRACTOR. WE FEEL THE BEST INVESTMENT IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT CONTRACTOR. I DO WANT TO SAY ONE THING WHICH IS THAT IN THIS. IT I HAVE BEEN CITY'S NEIGHBORHOODS AND IT SEEMS IT TAKES TO GET THE CLEAN UPS DONE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO RESORT FOR INSTANCE TO HAND EXCAVATION WE CAN'T USE LARGE MACHINERY TO DO THE JOB. AND IT'S THE LOGISTICS ARE VERY COMPLEX AND SO WE EVEN HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE CAN'T ADD ADDITIONAL CREWS BECAUSE THE IMPACTS TO PARKING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE. I JUST COMPLETELY UNMANAGEABLE SO THERE WILL BE A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH CLEAN UP WE CAN GET DONE. JUST BASED ON THE LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS. CATTERTON JUST LOGISTICALLY WE BECAUSE OF THE MAP I SAW LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN'T YOU'RE MITIGATING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS ALL ON ALL SIDES OF EXCITED TO PLAY- THE ORIGINAL PROPERTY. I MEAN WHY WOULD IN A CONTRACT TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON SAY THE EAST SIDE AND THE WEST SIDE YET TO CONTRACTORS ARE THREE IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH. AND WE DIDN'T TAKE LONG APPROACH WHEN WE STARTED THE PROJECT. ARE YOU JUST A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO THIS WHICH IS TO SAY THAT. WE STILL. DO FOR USE THAN THINK ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC THE GEOGRAPHY A LOT- AND AGAIN IF WE HAD A SECOND CONTRACTOR WE WOULD THINK ABOUT THOSE. SITUATIONS RIGHT NOW OUR INTENT IS NOT TO HAVE MOVED TO A SECOND CONTRACT. AND OF THE POTENTIAL TO. AND DIFFICULT GETTING ANOTHER SET CONTRACTOR ON BOARD. WELL THAT SAID- WE DO NEED TO WORK AGAIN IN A LARGE AND ON A LARGER OF PLACES SIMPLY THE SAKE OF MANAGING THE LOGISTICAL. COMPLICATIONS UNDERSTOOD YEAH I WOULD THINK WHETHER IT'S- ONE CONTRACTOR TO CONTRACTORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS I KNOW FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY JUST WANT PROPERTIES CLEANED. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- I DO HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS WILL GO HEAD TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO THAN SENATOR MORLOCK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT PLACE. ON COULD YOU DESCRIBE. WHAT A TYPICAL CLEANUP OR WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO WITH THE GRAVEL YOU TAKE AWAY- TO GET INVOLVED IN THE HOMES OR JUST THE YARD SO WHAT IS A TYPICAL CLEAN UP LIFE. THIS TYPICAL CLEAN INVOICE FIRST INFORM SAMPE THE PRO WE NOW SEEM ALL OF THE PER IN THAT ONE POINTS MILE RADIUS OR THE FACILITY LEAST ALL THE PROPERTIES WHERE THEY GAVE US ACCESS TO GO ON AND DO SAMPLING. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LEMASTER LIST OF THOSE PROPERTIES THAT SORTED BY THE LEVEL OF LEAD CONTAMINATION WE DO OUR REACH TO GET THOSE PROPERTIES IN THE QUEUE. ONCE A PROPERTY COMES UP TO THE TOP OF THE QUEUE WE NEED WITH THE RESIDENT WE INSPECT THE PROPERTY WE EXPLAINED THE PROCESS TO THEM THERE ARE MULTIPLE POINTS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH A PROPERTY RESIDENTS. TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THEY NEED TO PICK FOR INSTANCE THE FINISHES THE LANDSCAPING FINISHES THAT WOULD BE USED. IN THEIR IN THEIR- CLEAN UP AND SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE EXPLAIN IT TO THEM THEN OF COURSE ONCE THE TIME BEGINS TO BEGIN THE CLEAN UP TO CLEAN UP GOES ON IT TAKES TYPICALLY A WEEK TO DO THAT CLEAN UP SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES LESS DEPENDING ON. OF COURSE THE CONFIGURATION. AND THEN ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH ME- WE AND WE GO OUT AND INSPECT THAT WORK AND- THEN THE PROPERTY OWNER. IS WE MEET WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS SATISFACTORY AND CLOSE OUT THE PROJECT. ON FOR A GIVEN PROPERTY IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE WE REVIEW ALL OF THE INVOICES THAT COME IN WE GO OVER IT IN A GREAT DEAL OF IN FAN OF DETAIL TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE CHARGES ARE APPROPRIATE AND. MANAGE THAT VERY TIGHTLY. SO IS IT JUST OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE BUT GETS CLEANED UP. WE CLEAN UP THE OUTSIDE WE MAKE IT OUR WE MAKE AN OFFER TO RESIDENTS THAT IF THEY SHOULD WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE INTERIOR OF THEIR HOUSE. CLEAN DUSTED GET TO REMOVE ANY LEAD THAT WAS GENERATOR KICKED UP DURING THE CLEAN UP PROCESS. WE DO THAT IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT DONE IN THE MEANTIME THE COUNTY OF LA HAS FUNDS FOR LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT AND HAS BEEN DOING THAT WORK- IN THE SAME AREA. WHERE DOES THE SOIL YOU PICKED UP WHERE DOES IT END. SH WE DO WE DEPENDING ON THE LEAD CONTAMINATION OF ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOIL IT THAT WILL DETERMINE WHICH LAND WHICH TYPE OF LANDFILL IT WOULD GO TO. THANK YOU SOME OF IT WILL END UP IN A HAZARDOUS WASTE LANDFILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIRK MOVING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THEN SENATOR MORE LOCKED IN ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRS FOR HAVING THIS HERE AND- I THINK YOU MISS WILL FOR BEING HERE TODAY I AYE SIR SEE AS AN HOUR TO ONE CLEAN THE UP ON A THANK YOU- FOR TWO. THE HELM OF THE DTS- RECENTLY- IT'S NO SMALL TASK IT IS YOU KNOW NO- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN IN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS IS ON IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN THE PROBLEM WHEN THE- MILKER THE COFFEE SPILLED NOW THAT YOU'RE SITTING THERE YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO CLEAN IT UP. AND- BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT- THAT I RECOGNIZE. THAT THAT IT WASN'T YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR THIRTY THREE TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS WHEN I WASN'T IN TERM PERMIT- OR SOME OF THE FAILURES THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT- OVER AND OVER. BUT WE DO HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS. AND I'M GONNA ASK THE SAME QUESTION THAT I'M ASKING YOU CAN ANSWER NOW YOU CAN ANSWER LATER BUT- IT WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE DEPARTMENT YOU'VE GOT TO ASK A QUESTION. IT IS A CULTURAL ISSUE AT THE DEPARTMENT- WHAT IT CAN GET AXED RATE ISN'T NEGLIGENCE OR OR SHEER INCOMPETENCE IN SOME CASES RIGHT BECAUSE- WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIRTY ONE PROPERTIES THAT WERE MISSED- IT WASN'T LIKE WE MISSED YOU KNOW WE MAY SHUFFLE THE PIECE OF PAPER WE- WE DID A PERMIT WRONG. IT WAS THIRTY ONE PROPERTIES. SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS- TO A DIRECTOR AT THE TSC. WHO SHOULD BE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE ASKING HEY I'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE THIRTY ONE. PROPERTIES OF THESE OF THE LAWS THAT PREVENT ME FROM CLEANING IT UP. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE LEGISLATURE WE CHANGE LAWS. YOU KNOW IT IF WE NEEDED TO CLEAN IT UP WE CAN CHANGE THAT LAW- BUT TO HAVE IT FOUND OUT THERE WERE NOT IT IS. I WOULD. YOU KNOW BY BORA PROFESSIONAL SETTINGS I WON'T SAY WHAT I WANT TO SAY BUT IT'S- IT'S DISHEARTENING. TO FIND OUT THE TOOK A NOT AT THE FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS THIRTY ONE- PROPERTIES THAT WERE NOT CLEANED. WE COULD CHANGE THOSE LAWS- ASSEMBLY- EVEN NIGHT I THINK WE I COULD HAVE A- AN URGENT CLAUSE TO OF THOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT PROPER CLEANED OR AT LEAST WE WERE HAVE TRIED. SOMEONE JUST PUT THAT THERE AT THAT DAY YOU HAVE YOUR ABILITY- TO COME TO THE- SAY THIS IS WHAT'S PREVENTING- THE ABILITY FOR ME TO GETTING THIS STUFF DONE. LET'S LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON CHANGING WHATEVER IT IS WHATEVER OBSTACLE THERE IS THAT IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND WE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO DO THAT- THAT'S BEEN SET NOW- YEAH BUT BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE GENERAL GENERAL PUBLIC OR AT LEAST MY CONSTITUENTS IF I WERE TO GO TO THEM AND SAY HERE'S ALL THE DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE COULDN'T CLEAN UP THE PROPERTIES- THEY WOULDN'T HESITATE BUT BUT TO TRY TO FIND SOMEBODY NEW. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE FACING IT IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE NOT ONLY IMPLEMENT ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT MAYBE OR COMPLETE OVERHAUL AND REFORM OF THE T. T. S. C. SO THAT ACTUALLY CAN FIX THE PROBLEM THAT'S BEFORE US WHICH IS CLEANING UP THE PROPERTIES BECAUSE THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE PROPERTIES A LOT- EIGHT AND WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDS. YOU KNOW I KNOW I'VE I'VE I'VE SAID A COUPLE THINGS THAT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY. ABOUT BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR REACTION ON ON MAYBE- WHAT TOOLS YOU NEED. HOW IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE NOW THAT YOU. AND HOW WE GET THESE CLEANED UP AS FAST AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SAID BEFORE IN IN IN IT SOUNDS ALARMING BUT IT'S VERY TRUE. IT'S VERY TRUE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE. PEOPLE MAYBE HAVE DIED HAVE DIED IN COULD DIE WE HAVE KIDS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ASTHMA- WITHIN THE GENERAL POPULACE WITH IN THE GENERAL VICINITY MIND MINE INCLUDED- WE HAVE A- BUT WE HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF BIRTH DEFECTS AS YOU'VE HEARD IN THE AREA. HIGH LEVELS OF CANCER THE DISTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT REPORTS- WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF WATER A POTENTIAL BEING CONTAMINATED. AND YET WE'RE NOT MOVING AT LIGHTNING SPEED WITH WHAT A SENSE OF URGENCY BREAKING DOWN EVERY SINGLE PAYER BEFORE US- SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PAIN FRUSTRATION ANGER. I THAT THE RESIDENTS COLIN- AS IS WITH. AS THIS WITH WHAT I SAY I ALSO FEEL THAT I LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN CAN I GET YOUR REACTION ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE DONE THIS AUDIT. WHAT WE SEE THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAT SETS IN THAT SENSE OF URGENCY. THAT THIS COMMUNITY MERITS DEMANDS AND DESERVES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I HAVE TO SAY FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE THE PAIN AND FRUSTRATION WE HEAR IT DIRECTLY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. AS YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEARINGS AND WE HEARD. JUST HOW IMPACTFUL THIS HAS BEEN THOSE STORIES WERE REALLY TOUGH TO LISTEN TO AND IT'S REALLY- AGAIN IT DOES GIVE US A SENSE OF URGENCY. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S WILLINGNESS TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THIS CLEAN UP DONE AND TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THE DGSE HAS VERY GOOD AUTHORITIES WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE TECH REPRISE SAYS AND THIS REALLY COMES DOWN TO USING THOSE WITH AUTHORITIES USING THEM WISELY AND USING THEM STRATEGICALLY AND MAKE SURE THINGS GET DONE AND GET DONE QUICKLY. AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AND ARE MOVING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. IF YOU WERE TO GO ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY YOU WOULD EASILY BE ABLE TO FIND THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND WE TRACK OUR PROGRESS ON THE WEBSITE. WE WILL BE TRACKING THE SPECIFICS AROUND THE DAY CARES AND SCHOOLS ON THE WEBSITE ALSO THAT'LL BE UP AND RUNNING SHORTLY- AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO WEAR IT IF YOU SEE US GOING OFF TRACK. WITH WHAT I SAID TODAY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES WE HAVE LINED UP TO CLEAN BEFORE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I EXPECT TO BE BACK BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEES I EXPECT YOU TO ASK US WHAT WENT WRONG. BUT AS I SAID AND I TAKE DEEP PERSONAL PRIDE IN THIS WE ARE A LEARNING ORGANIZATION AND WE HAVE WORKED. AND SO YES MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE BUT WE ARE NOT. UP TEN PROPERTIES A MONTH WE'RE CLEANING UP SEVENTY PROPERTIES A MONTH WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY. AND WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO COURSE CORRECT. THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS OF THESE THE LARGER IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU TNC AND I'D SAY. WE ARE REGULATORS IT IS OUR JOB TO REGULATE AND PART OF THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS. AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BREAKDOWNS THAT CAME WITH RESPECT TO EXCITE WAS THE FACT THAT THAT INTERIM STATUS. PERMANENT A DECISION WASN'T MADE EITHER ON THAT ARE NOT IN A ROOM STATUS OF. SITUATION BUT IMPORTANTLY ON THE AT THE APPLE. THAT THEY SO. TO BE A PER FOR. AND THAT PERMIT WAS VERY LOW. AND YET THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T MAKE THE DECISION IN A TIMELY FASHION. SO FIRST OF ALL WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER SITES ON MONITORING STATUS INTERM STATUS IS ONLY FOR NEW SITES THAT COME ON BOARD AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR A PERMIT AND WAITING FOR A PERMIT DECISION SO. THERE ARE NO OFFICE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A SOME KIND OF PERMIT IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ENFORCE TO TAKE ACTION- FOR WE DO HAVE WHAT WE CALL CONTINUED PERMITS THOSE ARE PERMITS THAT EXPIRED BUT ARE. ARE STILL ENFORCEABLE AND THIS IS WHERE I RETURNED TO THE DECISION ISSUE. UNLESS THERE ARE UP TO DATE PERMITS IN PLACE THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MODERN BEST PRACTICES. FOR MANAGING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IT TAKES TO INSPECT AND ENFORCE A FACILITY. WE RUN THE RISK OF OTHER ACTS ACTS. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING DECISIONS AND TO MOVING THINGS FORWARD AND TO PUTTING THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. NEXT EXCITEMENT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN. AND I'M I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS I'M SEEING FROM OUR STAFF AND I WILL TURN THIS BACK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO. A LOT OF WHAT THE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS THE DIRECT RESULT OF. EITHER CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS AS A FOR INSTANCE WITH SB SIX SEVENTY THREE PUTTING THE VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURE IN PLACE FOR INCREASED INANCIAL ASSURANCE. OR GIVING US THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN AND ACCELERATE. OR PERMIT DECISION MAKING PROCESS. PLEASE I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY QUICK ON THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TIME CONSTRAINT SIZE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK A QUESTION. I WILL SAY THIS TO YOUR CREDIT. IT IS REFRESHING FOR THE FIRST TIME. SINCE I WAS A STAFFER- FOR THE PREVIOUS NUMBER IN OUR DISTRICT INSTANCES SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN A LEGISLATURE- THAT. ANY ONE PERSON- IN LEADERSHIP AT THE TNC. HAS IT MADE ANY ANY SORT OF THE STATE BY THE AGENCY. YOU KNOW YOU LEARN WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID THAT THAT IF YOU COULD ADMIT THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG THEN YOU CAN ADMIT THE FIXING IT. AND PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE EASY THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR I'VE EVER TALKED IS NOTHING CAN EVER GOLD. EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE. SO IT IS A BIT ENCOURAGING DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE- THE HURT AND THE ANGER THAT I FEEL- INSTEAD IS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS FEEL. AND IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE FIERCE- AND THE FIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS CLEANED UP. BUT AT LEAST ADMITTING. THAT THAT DECISION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE. AND IT WASN'T. ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FUTURE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. AND A HALF TO RESULT IN CLEANING UP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT LITTLE BIT PIECE AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT TO GO TO. I DIDN'T WANT THAT TO BE UNNOTICED BUT BUT I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH. HI I WOULD EXPECT- THAT IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER. DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE FORCEFULLY ON THIS SITE AND ANY OTHER SIGHTINGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT THERE ARE IF THERE ARE OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT YOU FROM CLEANING UP EXCITE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES DID THEY BE TOLD TO US SO WE CAN ADDRESS. ON AND CHANGE WHATEVER LAWS IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE I WOULD IMAGINE AFTER AFTER THIS I WOULD HAVE IF IT WAS ME I WOULD BE OPERATING LIKE A WRECKING BALL KNOCKING DOWN EVERY SINGLE OBSTACLE EVERY SINGLE WALL AND FIGHTING FIERCELY FOR EVERY SINGLE HOUSE TO BE CLEAN AND I EXPECT NOTHING LESS- FROM YOU OR FROM ME- ON. SALAS I HOLD THAT. I WANT TO BE A COMMIT WITHOUT PUT. WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL MOVE TO CENTER MORE TALK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISS WILLIAMS- AS YOU'RE REVIEWING THE SAMPLES OF ALL THE RESIDENCES IN THE AREA ARE YOU NOTICING ANY TRENDS OR DISTRIBUTION OR THEIR PLUMES OR LIKE A LIKE BUTTON NATURAL- OCEAN BREEZES THAT GO A CERTAIN DIRECTION MOST OF THE TIME ARE WE SAYING. WHAT WE SEEING FROM THE EXITE. PLANT WHERE WHERE WHERE MORE THE LEAD WEARS MORE THE LEAD LOCATED. SO WE HAVE SAMPLED ALL OVER THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILE RADIUS THAT WE CALLED THE PER KILOMETRE INVESTIGATION AREA. AND BLOODY IS A VERY I MEAN IT'S A HEAVY SUBSTANCE AND AS A RESULT IT'S NOT LIKE A VERY FINE WHITE WHITE NOT VERY DENSE SUBSTANCE BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE AIR IT DISTRIBUTES ITSELF EVENLY AND BLOWS AROUND. AND PUTTING EVEN COATING WHEREVER IT LANDS LET IS VERY DIFFERENT IT IT IT DEPOSITING VERY LOCALIZED WAVES YES THERE ARE SOME CAN AND SOME RELATIONSHIPS TO PREVAILING WINDS. BUT IT IS REMARKABLE HOW YOU CAN FIND A HIGH LEAD LEVEL IN ONE PROPERTY AND AN ADJACENT PROPERTY YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT SAME LEAD LEVEL AND THAT'S A POINT OF CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION OF FOLKS BUT THAT IS THE NATURE OF LAND AND HOW IT DISTRIBUTES UP. THERE ARE NO- IT'S NOT LIKE A GROUNDWATER PLUME WHERE YOU FOLLOW THE CAN MAN YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION. THANK YOU IN- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. HIRE NEW CONTRACTORS- SO I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS LONG TIME LINE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME YOU COULD HAVE SOMEHOW FIT IN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ROSS THIS REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL- WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY HINDERING YOU BUT WHAT IT HELP IF WE- DID NOT HAVE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT IS THAT HOLDING- BACK AT THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL BIDDERS. OR SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT. NON UNION CONTRACTORS AS WELL. CERTAINLY NOT. SORRY IT IS- STRAIGHT TO THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE- ABOUT. THIS PROJECT IS THAT PROJECT AGREEMENTS THAT AGREEING. ALLOWED US TO. THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY EXCITES OPERATIONS ACTUALLY GET TO BENEFITS IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT. FROM THE WORK THAT'S GENERATED DOING THIS CLEAN UP SO WE'D HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF COPD COHORTS GO THROUGH OUR WORKS. TRAINING TO BECOME ENVIRONMENTAL- AB BERMAN TECHNICIANS WE HAVE A NUMBER AND I'VE MET THEM- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WHOLE FAMILY OF FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS CLEAN UP. AND AND. HAVE FOUND EMPLOYMENT. IN SOME CASES FOR THE FIRST TIME ADULTS- ON THIS AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SOME LYFT CHANGE IMPACT OF THAT SO. THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT IS AGAIN IT'S A STATE REQUIREMENT ANYWAY TO GIVE PREVENT PREVAILING WAGE SO WE'RE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND WE BELIEVE IN IT VERY MUCH. IN TERMS OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN ANSWERING KIND OF THIS HOME STRETCH OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED. WE HAVE FELT THAT IT'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS CLEAN UP NO MATTER IF WE STARTED WITH ANOTHER CLEAN UP A CONTRACTOR- NEXT MONTH OR IN IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO GET THEM UP TO SPEED AND GET THEM ORIENTED. IT WOULD TAKE THEM AT LEAST SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS BEFORE THEY EVEN APPROXIMATED THE RATE OF CLEAN UP THAT WE SEE WITH OUR CURRENT CONTRACTOR. AND IF THE PRIORITY IS TO GET AS MANY PROPERTIES CLEANED UP AS FAST AS AS WE CAN. WE FEEL THAT THE BEST DECISION IS TO STICK WITH THE CONTRACTOR WE HAVE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TRACTORS AFTER WE KNEW IF WE NEED TO. THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO PUT QUALITY CONTROL IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING ALL THE BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE. BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO JUST NOT YOUR- IN MY CLOTHES AND THAT IS- THE DMV FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HELP SEVERE- THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WOULD BE FOR REAL ID. AND HAD A REAL MANPOWER SHORTAGE AND SO. OUR OFFICES GET TO HEAR ABOUT THAT SO MY CONSTITUENTS DRIVE MARCH COUNTY TO. PALM SPRINGS TO FIND A DMV OFFICE THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE HIM WAIT FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS. AND THEN WE'VE HAD UP THE LOCKDOWN- IN ITS AS IF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WAS JUST REALLY CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED- IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING TO HANDLE ALL THE REQUESTS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN GOING. CRAZY WITH THAT DEALING WITH THE CASELOAD- SO. WHAT IF YOUR CONTRACTOR DECIDED TO SAY HEY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS PROJECT ANYMORE. ARE WE SAYING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A YEAR TO GET A REPLACEMENT CONTRACTOR I. I'M I'M JUST GONNA JUST CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE MANPOWER MANAGEMENT TO GET YOU KNOW THE JOB DONE. AND IT IT ALWAYS SEEMS AS IF WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY DEPARTMENT HEADS DON'T. ANTICIPATE CERTAIN THINGS SAKE I NEED MORE MONEY IF I COULD HAVE A SECOND CONTRACTOR THEIR CONTRACTOR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE ME THOSE RESOURCES LET ME MOVE FORWARD. AND MAYBE THAT'S MORE OF A SPEECH I MISS WILLIAMS BUT- IT IS SORT OF A LIMIT TO HAVE A OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE LINE. COUPLE YEARS AND OFFICES. ON HOW DEPARTMENTS ARE SOMEHOW STEPPING UP TO THE MANPOWER. MANAGEMENT UP COMPONENT OF WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. IF I MAY I WILL SAY THIS. I WILL JUST SAY THAT RESEARCH ARE DEPARTMENT THAT UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE UNDER RESOURCE- THERE THE GOVERNOR DID PUT FORTH A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS OUR STARK STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND TO PUT ENOUGH RESOURCES IN PLACE SO THAT WE COULD DO A GOOD JOB AND DO THE JOB THAT WE NEED TO DO AND IT CALIFORNIANS NEED US TO DO- AND SO I TAKE YOUR COMMENTS VERY. SERIOUSLY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. THAT ADEQUATE RESOURCES BE IN PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA. THANK YOU- WHEN I TRY TO BE SB AS- THAT'S PART. WE KNOW TALKED ABOUT THE. IF SOMEONE LESS OF OTHER EMERGENCIES THAT MIGHT- MOVE RESOURCES AROUND AND SO FORTH. BUT WE'VE KNOWN SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN WE DID THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOAN AND THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE. MILLION DOLLAR LOAN THREE YEARS LATER THAT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO CLEAN UP ALL THE HOMES THAT ARE AFFECTED IT'S PREDICTABLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST FORTY SIX HUNDRED HOMES THAT ARE IN. THE TOP SIX DANGEROUS LEVEL OF LEAD AND WE HAVE NO PLAN TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN THEM UP. AND SAYS I'VE BEEN GOING HOME ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE CONSTANT FRUSTRATION. BUT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING AT THE TELLING FOLKS WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND THERE'S NO WINNERS AND LOSERS SHOULD BE TO MAKE SURE. EVERYTHING IS CLEANED UP WITH THAT IN MIND WE STARTED A BATTERY FEE FUND- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT STARTED TO COLLECT DOLLARS- AND WE'VE DONE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO ENSURE IT- BUT IT'S- IT'S BRINGING MEN. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN REVENUE. ARE WE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL PLANS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEN THAT. THOSE FUNDS MOVING FORWARD. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PLAN TO CLEAN UP ALL THESE HOMES- WHICH IS THE INTENT OF THAT. ORIGINAL BATTERY FEET- AND THAT'S HOW WE LOOK AT THE PUT. OF BAR. AT THE MONEY US THAT WE CAN CLEAN A BENEFIT. PACE AND THEN PAYING IT BACKS AND BETTER YOU YOU FIND. THANK YOU IS. MEMBER WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BEGIN TAPPING INTO THE LEAD ACID BATTERY RECYCLING FUND TO SUPPORT THE CLEAN UP WE WILL USE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER ADDITIONAL- STAFF. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A PURPOSE CLEAN UP AND WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING OF I'M- WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THAT FUND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN AND CAN- CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP BUT YES THAT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF FUNDING AND WE INTEND. THANK YOU AND WILL WE IS THERE A TIMELINE BY WHEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US MAYBE A MANY OF PLANS FOR CLEANUP BASED ON I KNOW THAT OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLES AS DOLLARS. SO WILL THERE BE A MANY OF IF THERE'S ONLY TEN MILLION VERSUS SIX FIFTY MILLION VERSUS IF SOMEHOW. WE APPROPRIATE ATTENTION AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE WE- CLEAN UP THE SALAS THESE HOUSES. IS THAT GOING TO BE COMING AND PROVIDE OUR- SEVEN POINT. WELL AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF BUDGET UNCERTAINTY THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY- AND THEN AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE BUDGET PROCESS CAN IS A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT BUT WE DO REVISIT OUR ENGINEERS ESTIMATES ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AN ONGOING PROCESS NOW AND SO WHEN THE TIME COMES WE'RE SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE GOOD ESTIMATES AND CAN. GAIN CAN TELL PEOPLE WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET ADDITIONAL CLEAN UP THE- YEAH I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SPEAK TO. DURING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS TO SAFE FOR US TO DO X. AMOUNT OF HOMES IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO WHICH WOULD BE WITHIN OUR TARGET THE SAID THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. I THINK HAVING THAT BEFORE US ALLOWS US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE. AND HAVE FRANK DISCUSSIONS THAT WOULD GET THEM GO HOME AND HAVE FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS WELL AND THEN FINALLY I WILL SAY THAT I'VE I'VE- I'M EXHAUSTED WERE BETTER I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE I GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMUNITY SIX ALSO BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT WAY LONGER THAN I. THAN I HAVE. HI AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE MANY MORE MEMBERS WHO ARE AREPART OF THIS FIGHT NOW- AND THE DEPARTMENT THAT I THINK IS TRYING THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP. TO GET IT RIGHT- AND TO AND TO LEARN IT AND TO MOVE FORWARD AND THEN TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYMORE EXCITES US. IN THE FUTURE- WE WERE BORED AND SO. I DO HOPE YOU LOOK AT THE TNC REFORM WHILE AB NINE IF I WAS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRESS THERE. THAT WE WILL BE VISITING- NEXT YEAR INCLUDING THE FINANCIALS PRESSURE AND SAYS- TO ENSURE WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT THAT. DOES ITS JOB AND HELP. KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHY. COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED FOR WAY TOO LONG THAT HAPPEN TO BE A COLOR LINE COME- THAT. THAT HAVEN'T. HAD JUSTICE OF FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. IF I MAY. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THOSE COMMENTS- AND- I. I WILL SAY THIS THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. NOT JUST RELATED TO- WHERE THE SITE SURFACED FOR. PERMITTED BUT REALLY WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTION ISSUES- WE DID MAKE A LOT OF AND- PROGRESS. ON THE CONVERSATIONS BOTH BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. COMPREHENSIVE REFORM AND THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE IN NINE NINE FIVE. I THINK WE DID LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT- WHAT WE LEARNED. FOR INSTANCE WAS THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO GIVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THE PERMITTING PROCESS WE DID FIND SOME OTHER AVENUES FOR STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL INSURANCE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE ALL OF THOSE MEASURES. THIRTY SECONDS. PLEASE AND MOVIE BE ABLE TO GET A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS FROM THE TNC- IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO THAT'S ALSO PART OF OUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS YEAH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY EAGER TO SHARE WITH YOU OR ANALYSIS OF WHERE THE RESOURCES. IN THE D. N. D. T. S. C. ARE GOING WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET ON WITH OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES HAND. ON WHAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO. TO HAVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT PRIORITIES AND WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE YOUR RESPONSE THANKS ASSEMBLY WOMAN- GARCIA I DO THINK THAT'S A- AND YOU WERE CHAMPION OF THE- THE BATTERY FEE TO HELP SET ASIDE ANOTHER. FUNDING POT ACTUALLY CLEAN UP THESE SITES I WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GOING TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND THEN AFTER BIRTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WE WILL MOVE TO OUR REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS. MR HOLDEN PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE TO YOUR BEING HERE AND BEING ABLE TO BE TRANSPARENT AND PRESENTATION AND ALSO. RECEPTIVE TO NOT ONLY THE QUESTIONS OF HOW. AND WHY BUT THAT YOU RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE- THE CHALLENGES THAT. OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED UNDER AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE PROVIDING. AND THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH WITH YOU- I WANTED TO REALLY JUST TAKE A- QUICK SECOND TO. ASK PROCESS QUESTION ON TWO AREAS AND MY APOLOGIES IF. THIS WAS BROUGHT UP IN YOUR INITIAL PRESENTATION- BUT IN THE REPORT THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT- SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. WAS SPENT MORE OF THESE CONTRACTS DUE TO POOR CONTRACT PROTECTIONS. AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF HOW YOUR CONTRACTS ARE NEGOTIATED IF THEY ARE STAFF. NON LAWYERS NEGOTIATING OR THESE CONTRACTS THAT ARE BEING NEGOTIATED BY THE STATE BY CONTRACT LAWYERS WHO ARE- VALUE WAITING THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF WHAT NEEDS TO GO INTO A CONTRACT TO ENSURE. THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S BEST INTEREST IS BEING PROTECTED SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST QUESTION IN TERMS OF. HOW WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR NEGOTIATING YOUR CONTRACTS. THANK YOU- WE DO IN FACT HAVE OF CONTRACT LOOK ATTORNEYS ON STAFF AND THEY DO SUPPORT US EXTENSIVELY AND HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS WORK BUT I AM GOING TO LET OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NAY GRIEF RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION IN DETAIL. CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS. OUR I THANK YOU FOR THE ARE TO BE HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- IS- DOCTOR WILLIAMS IS INDICATED WE ARE A LEARNING ORGANIZATION AND AT THE TIME THAT WE- YOU KNOW WE WERE- A LOAN TO THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAD HAD. A LOT OF EXPERIENCE EXECUTING LARGE CONTRACTS- AS TO A DOCTOR WHIMS ALSO INDICATED WE DO HAVE ATTORNEYS ON BOARD I'M HERE. HI THIS ATTORNEYS- NO IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ALSTER ARE CONTRACTING PROGRAMS AND PROCESSING SO YES A SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT- HOW WE EXECUTE OR HELP WITH THE PROCESS OF EXECUTING CONTRACTS WELL THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THIS INITIALLY THE LARGE CONTRACT- FOR THIS PROJECT WAS EXECUTED UNDER WHAT'S CALLED A TIME AND MATERIALS CONTRACT AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR. REFERENCES THAT AND AT THE TIME THAT WE WENT INTO THAT CONTRACT WE ACTUALLY TRY TO GO OUT WITH A COMPETITIVE BID WE- PARTNERED WITH OUR OWN SHOW OUR FRIENDS OVER DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE IN. LARGE CONTRACTS THAT'S THIS IS FUTURE AND BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT THAT WERE UNKNOWN AT THAT TIME- WE FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO CONTRACT UNDER- R. F. P. PROCESSOR OTHER COMPETITIVELY BID PROCESS SEES. SO THE TIME ACCIONES CONTRACT IS A IS A CONTACT MECHANISM THAT IS USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH OTHER STATE GOVERNMENTS. WE'VE GOT ELEMENTS OF A PROJECT THAT OR SHE ARE. UNKNOWN OR UNDETERMINED. AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THE PROJECT WE KNOW A LOT MORE TODAY THAN WE KNEW WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WITH SUBSEQUENT CONTRACTS AND I KNOW DOCTOR WILLIAMS MENTIONED AND YOU SEE WHICH IS OUR PRIME CONTRACTOR NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- GET INTO- CONTRACTS THAT ARE HYBRIDS ARE FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THOSE COSTS. THE- THE ORIGINAL TIME ANGELES CONTRACT I THINK IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER FOR THE CONTRACT ACTIVITIES FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW MORE A. LOT MORE THAN WE DID YEAH- THAT TO MAKE SURE- AND ENTERED AND THIS PART. I WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT WE TAKE SOME STEPS VERY PROACTIVE STEPS TO SORT OF STOPS. YOUR CONTACT. YEAH DTS ABOUT HALF OF THE MONTH AGO WE HEARD. WHOSE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE PARKING PROCESS USED TO GO TO ALL OF OUR CONTRACT PROGRAMS AND PROCESS EASIER AND TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND STRENGTHEN THOSE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. SO WE'RE MAKING WE HAVE A- WE'VE YOU KNOW UPDATED OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES ARE MANUAL R. CHENEY- AND ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE PROJECTS AND THIS PROJECT. WILL ENSURE THAT WE ARE CONTRACTING AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. AND GETTING THE BEST VALUE STATE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE OF THE- I DO SO THAT. IT IS CLEARLY ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE- BECAUSE YOU KNOW SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY ON ONE CONTRACT SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN THE PLACE OF- REFORM AND I THINK THAT'S APPRECIATED THE LAST QUESTION THAT I HAD AGAIN PROCESS. AS IT RELATES TO- THE EXCITES OF BANKRUPTCY WHAT ARE WHAT IS THE PROCESS WOULD HAVE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO PROTECT THE STATE AND ENSURE THAT WE DO GET REIMBURSED I KNOW THAT THERE'S A QUESTION IN THAT REGARD. BUT HOW DO WE ESTABLISH A STRONG POSITION THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE REIMBURSED. FOR THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT OUT IN THIS- THEY WERE SEEKING TO GET BACK FROM- FROM EXIDE. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I'LL I'LL DEFER TO- DEPUTY DIRECTOR GRANT COPE TO ANSWER WITH GREATER SPECIFICITY BUT- THE STATE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO AND WILL BE PURSUING ALL AVENUES TO HOLD ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE COST OF THIS PROJECT AND- WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT OCCURS. NOW GO AHEAD AND HAVE GRANT COPE ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC. ABOUT THAT. CAN I ASK THIS THOUGH- AND AGAIN JUST I KNOW WERE UNDER- THE TIME HERE TO SORT OF MOVE TO THE NEXT- ELEMENTS. OF THE SITE HEARING BUT I WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND JUST IN TERMS OF. BECAUSE I'M JUST SORT OF MY MOST RECENT BANKRUPTCY IS DEALING WITH- PG&amp;E. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THAT- ALONG WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT- TO WHAT EXTENT. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S. IT IS IT IS BEING- PRESENTED IN THE MOST. AFFECTED IN STRONG WAY BEFORE THE COURT- AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW INTIMATE PARK IS THE STATE GOING TO BE WITH THE COURT. AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE PROTECTED. WHAT THE- THIS DOES STATE WE IT WITH THIS PARTICULAR ARM IN CASE THAT THE STATE DID CONTACT WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND IS CLOSELY WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE'S INTEREST ARE ARE- BEING ASSERTIVELY- REPRESENTED- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST REPRESENTATION YEAH THIS IS POSSIBLE SEE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE ARE CHALLENGING IN PARTICULAR IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING THAT- THESE TYPES OF. SITUATIONS ARE ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED BUT NEVERTHELESS- IN ADDITION TO. YOU KNOW THE NGO WE HAVE CONTRACT WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL. OKAY AND IS THERE. SOME INTERACTION THAT IS CONTINUING THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS THERE ARE- INTERACTION WITH- WITH THE DEPARTMENT WITH ACCOUNT COMMITTEE THIS COMMITTEE OR OTHERS TO TRY TO KEEP THE IS HOW HOW DO WE STAY CONNECTED TO THE PROGRESS. THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN THIS THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND WHAT THE COURT. WELL I SAID I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW AS AS COURT PROCEEDINGS HAVE COME UP WE'VE BEEN IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO NOTIFY THEIR MEMBERS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT INTO THE PROCESS WHEN APPROPRIATE. SO I THINK WE'VE BEEN IN IN IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH. LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THE CURRENT PROGRESS AND STATUS. OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN R. LET ME TURN TO YOU ARE YOU COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE GETTING AS IT RELATES TO THIS BANKRUPTCY AND- OUR CLARITY OF PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK THAT IS. GIVING YOU CONFIDENCE THAT THE STATE IS. ENGAGING IN A VERY AGGRESSIVE WAY ON BEHALF OF THE- TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK RESTORED AND I KNOW THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS OUT FOLLOWING THIS CASE AS WELL AS A U. S. ATTORNEY AS WELL- BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS- THAT EXCITED MUST MEET. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO PROCEED OUT FROM THOSE PROCEEDINGS- COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT NOW THAT THE BANKRUPTCY IS HERE I KNOW THAT EACH OF THE ATTORNEYS BUT THAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL REEVALUATING. AND SO WERE- TAKING THAT IN STRIDE AS WELL- AND TAKING- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ATTORNEYS ARE GOING TO DO BECAUSE I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THOSE CHARGED WITH FELONY CHARGES. AND SOME OF THOSE CHARGES WERE DROPPED- IN RESPONSE EXIDE MITIGATING. SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR COMMITMENTS AND- WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT MEANS THE COURTS AS WELL AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL IN THIS CASE. WHAT THE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS I KNOW WE HAVE SENATOR DRAWS OVER ONCE ASK NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AS LONG ALONG WITH US SENATOR ALAN. SO LET'S FIRST BEGIN WITH SENATOR DRAW SO PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR. I JUST WANNA ASK I AND I APPRECIATE DR UP WILLIAMS- REFERRING TO DECISION MAKERS ARE DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE BY THE- BY THE DEPARTMENT- YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS SPECIFICALLY- BUT I DO THINK THAT DECISION MAKERS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE MADE AN EVALUATION OF WHO SHOULD STAY AND WHO SHOULD NOT STAY. IN THAT DEPARTMENT AS FAR AS DECISION MAKERS- I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO WE JUST CAN'T KEEP LETTING THIS GO ON AND ON AND ON SO ONE I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT- SECOND I KNOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA ASKED UP A NUMBER OF SEPARATE- QUESTIONS THAT WE COULD FOLLOW UP ON FROM YOU- BUT I THINK OF THE- AUDITOR OF MENTIONED- NOT HAVING. A PLAN OR A STRATEGY TO MOVE FORWARD ON DIFFERENT ISSUES SUCH AS THE COSTS ON PRIORITIES AND THE SCHEDULE SO CAN WE EXPECT OUT OF NOT A SERIES OF ANSWERS BUT ACTUALLY A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AS TO HOW YOU MOVE FORWARD- FROM YOU AND INCLUDED. IN THAT IS SOME. I NOT FOR. THE BUDGET TO HEAR BUDGET TO TELL YOU HERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE NEED FROM YOU IS OPTIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF. THIS MUCH MONEY WILL DO THIS IN CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME OR THIS OPTION THIS IS ANOTHER OPTION SO I WOULD NEED THAT AND EXPECT THAT. FROM YOU TO PROVIDE THAT AND THEN LAST RELATED TO THE- BANKRUPTCY- I KNOW THAT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN IN. VERY REGULAR REPORTS BACK FROM THE AG THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT- PROVIDING UPDATES FOR US AND YOU KEEPING US INVOLVED- BUT- WITH REGARDS TO THAT- IN TERMS OF THE CLEAN UP PROCESS HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING. WEAPON REALLY APPOINTED- IT'S CALLED EXIDE BRING AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE TRUST AND THE TRUSTEE. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU- MISS WILLIAMS IF YOU WILL. WHO ARE ONLY TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF HER OF- DECEMBER MEMBERS QUESTIONS- THAT IS TO SAY THAT WITH RESPECT TO DECISION MAKERS ARE YOU OUR ENTIRE EXECUTIVE TEAM TALKS REGULARLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING STRONG TIMELY DECISIONS THAT ARE PROTECTED AND A SPECIALLY PROTECTED TO THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. WITH RESPECT TO. THE AS AND PLANNING FOR FUTURE ADDITIONAL CLEAN UP I THINK I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT YOU DO YOU ESTIMATES WILL CONTINUE TO DO ESTIMATES BUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE'LL PUT YOU WE CAN GUARANTEE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL UNTIL WE HAVE. GIVEN A GREAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL SITUATION BUT WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION AS NEEDED- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THEN- WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUSTEE FROM THE TRUSTEE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE STATE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSIBLE BANKRUPTCY WHAT'S THAT. C. LAW ALLOWS RESPONSIBLE TO ABANDON PROPERTIES AND THEY CAN WALK AWAY AND THE PROPERTY CAN BE COMPLETELY. UNPROTECTED IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE- TO KEEP SAFE TO SELL IF BUT WHEN THE MOMENT COMES. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A TRUSTEE IN PLACE- THAT TRUSTEE HAS JUST PICKED UP ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT EXCITE HATS SO- THEY THEY HAVE RESPONSIVE WE HAD. SOME QUESTIONS WEEKEND TWO WEEKENDS AGO AND EVER SINCE THE- VERY RESPOND WELL AND THEY ARE USING THE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE FUNDS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. ON THE CLEAN UP OF THE FACILITY ITSELF. AND THE TO THE TRI- ALSO ASKED THE TRUSTEE FOR HIS PLAN FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND KEEPING YOU AND TO THE COMMUNITY UP TO DATE ON ANY- PROGRESS AT THE FACILITY. YOU. GREAT THANK YOU- I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE FOLLOW UPS FROM SENATOR BROWSERS THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO SENATOR ALAN. HI THERE- THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. I'M I GUESS I WANTED WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS I KNOW I KNOW THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE IDEA HERE BUT I'M INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW THIS PRODUCT QUESTION THAT YOU JUST RAISE WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE BANKRUPTCY WE'RE WE'RE STUCK HOLDING THE BAG HERE AND- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON IT LEGISLATION AND WE'RE GONNA SPEND SOME TIME. LOOKING AT BUT I'M- FORTUNATE WE- ARE CAN WE JUST TALK- DO YOU HAVE ANSWERS TO THE KINDS OF COSTS THE STATE'S GOING TO LIKELY BE STUCK WITH HERE. YOU KNOW BOTH RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP IN THE ACTUAL SITE CLEAN UP LIKE WE HAVE. TO HAVE ESTIMATES AS TO WHAT. AS TO WHAT COSTS- THE STATE OR NOT IS NOW ON THE HOOK. BOB FOR. YOU JUST HAVE TO THE RESIDENTS PROPERTY THINK WE'VE SPOKEN TO YOU TIMES BUT I AM GOING TO LET DEPUTY DIRECTOR GRANT CALLED TALK ABOUT THE FACILITY CLEAN UP COSTS. YEAH. I'M SO AN INSERT YOUR QUESTION CENTER ALLEN WE'VE GOT TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL USE TO BOTH CONTINUE WHAT IS PHASE ONE OF CLOSURE THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE REGULATED UNDER HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS. AND DEMOLISHES BRING THEM DOWN TO GROUND LEVEL. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE VERNE ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST TO DO OTHER WORK ONSITE USING THAT FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE RISKS THAT WE CAN USING THOSE FUNDS. SO THINK ABOUT SPRING WATER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT DOES DOESN'T BELONG AROUND PAVING AREAS TO MAKE CERTAIN THE DUST- IS MORE- HELD IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO AUTOMATICALLY MAINTAIN IT EVERY DAY. BUT THEN ALSO WORKING WITH THE OTHER BUILDINGS THAT CONTAIN LEAD. TO CLOSE OUT. OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LEAD THAT COULD LEAD FROM THOSE BUILDINGS. WE'RE GONNA USE EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE HAVE. TO UNDERTAKE EVERY ACTIVITY THAT'S NEEDED. TO ADDRESS AS MANY OF THE MEDIA AS WE CAN. OKAY I'M- SO YOU'RE YOU'RE STARTING THAT PROCESS IS THAT IS THAT UNDER WAY NOW. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE EXIDE DISCONTINUED CLOSURE OPERATIONS WHEN PADDOCK KEPT. AB SO BACK IN MARCH WE ORDERED THEM TO RESTART ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T AGREE THAT THEY COULDN'T% UNDERTAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN AT DIFFERENT FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE. EXIDE BASICALLY REFUSED TO UNDERTAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES UNTIL THEY WENT BANKRUPT NOW WE'RE DOING IS WORKING WITH A TRUST TO RESTART ALL THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES ON SITE. OKAY AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE ALSO. IS THERE IS THERE IS THE CURING PROCESS THAT DID YOU UNDERGO NOW TO YOU. IN ADDITION A CLEAN UP- SO SITE SECURITY. SPECIFICALLY WELL JUST SECURING WANTED TO. I GUESS THE STEPS YOU HAVE TO TAKE TO JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS YEAH THE SAKE ABSOLUTELY- WHAT THAT SO LET ME TAKE FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS ON SITE THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY PERMITTED BUT THAT CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS. OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE WORKED WITH THE VERNE ENVIRONMENT TRUST THE TRUSTEE. SPECIFICALLY TO SAY WHAT IS YOUR PLAN. FOR MITIGATING THE RISKS AND THOSE BUILDINGS AND WE NEED IT NOW AND IT IS PARTNER FIRST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT BUDGET. SO WE HAD TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVITIES IN THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BUDGET. AND I RECEIVED AN UPDATED DRAFT OF THAT THIS MORNING AND PORTHLEVEN AT A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH USEPA WHO'S TECHNICALLY AGENCY STILL UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY AGREEMENT. AND THE RURAL AND OF THE FIRM AND VIRAL TRUSTEE TO INCLUDE THOSE TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE RISKS. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE RESOURCES. OKAY I'M- I THINK I'M MORE MORE BROADLY DO YOU THINK WE'VE AND NEEDS FOR YOUR FROM PARIS RIGHT BUT OUR OUR WILL WHAT ARE WE DOING I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE SURE THIS KIND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN I MEAN WHAT WE KNOW WITHIN THE- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. YEAH. SO- I HAVE A PHRASE THAT MY STAFF GETS REALLY TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT WHICH IS BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG IT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT WENT WRONG AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID IN THE FUTURE AND SO WE HAVE DONE A LOT FOR POST MORTEM ON EXIDE. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS IT ABOUT OUR CURRENT PROCESS THAT DIDN'T ALLOW US TO MAKE THAT PERMIT DECISION IF WE HAD HAD A PERMANENT PLACE WHAT PROTECTIONS WITHOUT PERMIT NEEDED TO HAVE- WE NOW HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURE WHICH GIVES EVERYONE THE VISIBILITY OF HOW WELL FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE PERMITTED FACILITIES ARE COMPLYING WITH HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS WE ISSUE A SCORECARD EVERY SEPTEMBER. AND THAT COULD BE BASED ON THAT SCORE WE EITHER A SIGN OF FACILITY AND UNACCEPTABLE SCORE CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE SCORE OR AN ACCEPTABLE SCORE AND THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU FOR THEIR ACCEPTABLE THEY CAN CONTINUE OPERATIONS IF THEY'RE CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT ON ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SO FOR INSTANCE WE CAN SAY W'RE GOING TO INSPECT THEM MORE FREQUENTLY WE CAN REQUIRE THAT WE REVIEW THEIR FINANCIAL ASSURANCE MORE FREQUENTLY OR WHATEVER OTHER CONDITIONS WE THINK WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE. IF SOMETIMES IF A FACILITY IS IN THE- UNACCEPTABLE TEAR WE BEGAN AFTER THE DISPUTE PROCESS AND ANY THERE'S A DISPUTE PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUAL INSPECTION SCORES AND THEN ON UP TO A DISPUTE PROCESS FOR WHAT WE CALL THE TIER ASSIGNMENT AND ONCE THAT PROCESS IS THROUGH IT PUTS US IN A POSITION TO BEGIN REVOKING- REVOKING THE PERMIT FOR ANY FACILITY THAT LANDS IN pTHAT CATEGORY SO THIS IS A NEW TOOL FOR US- AND BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THE PERMIT GETTING THE PERMIT DECISIONS MADE. THAT REFLECT. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CURRENT COPY RATIONS OF THE- WE HAVE SOME- PERMITS AND- THE OF THOSE. WERE WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT RISK HOW THAT JUST. ARE TODAY'S WE NEED TO KIND TO GET. DECISIONS WE HAVE IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN- COMMITMENT TO MAKE ALL OF OUR PERMIT DECISIONS OR 90% OF OUR PERMIT DECISIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS OF RECEIPT OF AN ACCEPTABLE PERMIT. SO ONCE THEY GIVE US A- REPUBLICATION THAT'S COME ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLETE WE COMMIT TO A TWO YEAR TIME WORK TIME FRAME TO GETTING THAT PERMIT DECISION MADE SO THAT FACILITIES ARE OPERATING ON OUT OF BASED ON HOW TO DATE UNDERSTANDING. OF THOSE- OF HOW THERE THEY WORK BUT THAT ALSO THEN GIVES US VERY WERE MUCH CLEARER AND HOW WE WRITE OUR PERMIT WE'VE HAD A PERMIT ENFORCEMENT OR PERMIT ENHANCEMENT WORK PLAN. SO THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CHECKLISTS WE HAVE WE'VE CHANGED OUR INSPECTORS ARE TRAINED WE ROTATE THEM THROUGH DIFFERENT FACILITIES SO THAT THEY DON'T GET STALE BY GOING. GOING TO A FACILITY AND SEEING THE SAME THINGS TIME AND WE MIX IT UP WE CROSS TRAIN WE STRENGTHEN OUR PRESS ONE FORSMAN AND ACTUALLY THAT'S A BIG AREA OF FOCUS. NOT JUST FOR DGSE BUT FOR KELLY P. AS A WHOLE- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING AND THEN I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FINANCIAL ASSURANCE AGAIN THERE WERE PROVISIONS IN NINE NINE FIVE. THAT WERE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION BUT THERE MAY BE THINGS WE CAN GO BEYOND THAT WE'RE REALITY CHECKING SOME OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSURANCE BY VALIDATING HOW MUCH IT REALLY TAKES TO CLEAN P A FACILITY VERSUS HOW MUCH WE HAD TO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HER CALCULATOR SAYS IT SHOULD COST. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING GOOD ESTIMATES I COULD GO WHICH YEAH OKAY- OUR- SO IS THAT ALL THAT GOOD I WOULD WHAT I WANT IT I STILL TO GLAD I GUESS ON A DRILLING ON ITS THIS WHOLE. QUESTION OF LIABILITY- TO STATE SO WE ARE SOME OF THE SO DO WE KNOW. SITE CLEAN UP COSTS I WILL NOT BE. BY THE SETTLEMENT MONEY. A LOT. RIGHT CAN WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN FINANCIAL ASSURANCE AND THEN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FROM THE SETTLEMENT ITSELF. AND YOU KNOW THE FACILITY COSTS WILL BE UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT'S- SO AGAIN. YEAH SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- OVER SEVENTY MILLION THAT THAT THE STATE IS ON THE HOOK FOR BASICALLY. OKAY SO I GUESS I GUESS. SO EVERYTHING YOU TALKED ABOUT THESE- CERTAINLY GONNA BE HELPFUL- I IT DOES MAKE ME THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MAY BE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GET HOSED IN ANY FUTURE BANKRUPTCIES WON'T NEED ARE WE LOOKING AT TRYING TO BE CONSIDERED A SECURE CREDITOR SO WE GET CLOSER TO THE FRONT LINE FOR CLEANUP REIMBURSEMENT- SECOND THING SO. I LEARNED A LOT AND WE ALL LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BANKRUPTCY THROUGH THROUGH THIS PROCESS NUMBER ONE HOW FAST IT MOVES AND NUMBER TWO WHO GETS TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE AND IT IS QUITE FRANKLY IT'S ALARMING WHO IS CONSIDERED A SECURED CREDITOR AND HOW THEY GET THAT STATUS AND ARE THERE IS A PRECEDENT KNOWN AS MID ATLANTIC. WHICH SHE DOES SAY THAT THEY'RE JUST SO BAD OWNERS ARE ALLOWED TO ABANDON THEIR PROPERTIES AND THAT THAT PROVISION IN THIS LAND OF PRECEDENT HAS BEEN USED IN INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS TO WELL IT TO YOU KNOW TO PUT A VERY NARROW WINDOW FOR- STOOD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION- IN THE IN PLACE DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SO. I THINK THE BANKRUPTCY IS IT IS AN AREA OF OPPORTUNITY WILL TAKE LEGAL STRATEGY IT WOULD TAKE- ALL OF A LOT OF ANALYSIS BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S POSSIBLE THERE ARE VULNERABILITIES. AROUND BANKRUPTCY. ALL RIGHT NOW WITH THAT SEVERAL LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS FOR BY TWO THIRTY. SO NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T. QUESTION I DON'T KNOW HOW. THANK YOU MISS. THANK YOU MATTER. MISTER CHAIRMAN HOW DO YOU GET RECOGNIZED ON THIS THING. MR VOEPEL THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE DO HAVE A NEW PEOPLE BEEN TEXTING ME REMOTELY IF MEMBERS WANT TO HAVE QUESTIONS IF NOT YOU LET THE SERGEANTS KNOWN SERGEANTS WILL MAKE SURE WE GET YOU IN THE QUEUE AS WELL- BUT SINCE WE HAVE YOU ON THE LINE GOOD ASK YOUR QUESTION MR VOEPEL. WELL MY QUESTION IS I GOT THIS BRAND NEW MACHINE SITTING HERE ON MY DESK WHICH I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO OPERATE- WHAT WE'RE DOING THESE COMMITTEE MEETINGS THIS WAY. YES SPEAK UP. I DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER STAFF JUST GAVE ME THIS. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE FOR HOUSEKEEPING PURPOSES. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THESE TYPES OF COMMITTEE MEETINGS. K. THANK YOU MR VOEPEL YEAH I BELIEVE- EVERYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE WAS PROVIDED NUMBERS FOR NOT ONLY LOGGING IN REMOTELY BUT ALSO CONTACTING SERGEANTS IF- YOU NEED TO GET A HOLD OF US OR TO GET IN THE QUEUE- BUT WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL MR VOEPEL IF NOT WE'LL MOVE TO SENATOR GONZALEZ I'M GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL GO BACK ON MUTE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THIS. MACHINE THANK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH THAT LET'S MOVE TO SENATOR GONZALEZ THANK YOU SALAS THIS CONVERSATION AND THANK YOU DIRECT PARTNER- I. ALSO WANT TO LET MY COMMENTS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JUST ON THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL I KNOW WHAT'S- ALL. REMEDIES POSSIBLE I KNOW WE- GOT THROUGH IT THE HUGE HURDLE WELL NOT. BUT THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY- AND ALSO WITH THE CONTRACTS WHICH I FEEL VERY EASY ABOUT- YOU KNOW I KNOW- WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT MOVING FORWARD BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT- THE CONTRACTOR SITUATION SEEM TO BE. YOU KNOW VERY UNSETTLING FOR ME- PARTICULARLY- THE ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE IS ABOUT THE- NO PERMISSION TO SAMPLE CLEAN THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN UP PROPERTIES THAT HAVE DEFINED CLEAN UP THREE OF WHICH I BELIEVE ARE DAY CARES AND SCHOOLS. I KNOW THAT WAS TOUCHED ON A BIT CAN YOU GIVE ME MORE INFORMATION ON- WHAT THAT PROCESS WOULD LOOK. LIKE- YEAH. SO I SAID WE DO. GOOD OF FORTY TWO ABLE TO HELP UP AND I'M GOING TO LET DEPUTY. CALL SPEAK. TO I SAID I GONZALEZ. WE ARE- IT OF LOS. POSITION RIGHT NOW WITH PROPERTY OWNERS. WE NEED- FORTY TO GO ONTO THEIR PROPERTY NEXT TO SAMPLING. AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH THEM TO DO SCHEDULING WHEN WE WANTED TO CLEAN HOUSE- YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT SOME PEOPLE THAT- DENIES THE ABILITY TO GO UNDER THE PROPERTY. YOU SAMPLING WORKS. BUT THERE'S A PARTICULAR IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THEM THEY'RE NOT OF THE BUSINESS SO- WITH. ASSEMBLY WERE TRYING WORK WITH THEM WE'RE KIND OF BENDING OVER. IF AT SOME POINT THEY CONTINUE TO SAY NO. WE CAN ISSUE AN ORDER. THAT SAYS WE'RE COMING ON YOUR PROPERTY WORK OUT A PLAN. AND THEN WE WILL ENFORCE THAT PLAN ON YOUR PROPERTY YOU WOULD STILL ENDEAVOR TO WORK WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS IN AND THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE BUSINESS. BECAUSE THAT IS OUR LIFE. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT ALL THE WORK IS NEEDED ON THOSE PROPERTIES IS COMPLETED. THANK YOU AND I JUST HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP- COMMENT- IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR IS. ASK FOR ABOUT THE COUPLE CLEAN UP AND I. FOR ADDRESSING THAT THERE WAS A CLEAN UP I GUESS IN OMAHA BUT IT A SEVENTEEN YEAR- I DON'T KNOW THAT MESSAGING IS SOMETHING THE PUBLIC WANTS TO HEAR RIGHT IS THAT WORK FASTER THAN SOMETHING THAT TOOK. ANOTHER LOCATION THAT TOOK SEVENTEEN YEARS- AND FOR THE AUDIT IT ALSO MENTIONS THAT THE DETAILS HE DID NOT QUITE PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SEARCH METHODS HE DIED. SO A MESSAGING VERY. IF YOU'D LIKE TO THAT GREAT BUT I JUST I THINK THAT THERE'S- A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TALK TRACK WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC YEAH. THE WAY THAT I DESCRIBE THIS IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE'VE CLEANED UP MORE PROPERTIES MORE QUICK QUICKLY THAN ANY OTHER RESIDENTIAL LET CLEAN UP IN THE NATION. IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING PERFECTLY WE LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES THAT IS PART OF WHY. WHAT WE WANNA DO IS USE EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S PROVIDED TO US AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP AS MANY PROPERTIES AS POSSIBLE. AND WE WILL DO THAT EVERY DAY THAT WE ARE. WE ARE IN THIS POSITION. OKAY WITH THAT THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- LET ME ASK- THE DEPARTMENT- OF- TALK SUBSTANCE CONTROL MISS WILLIAMS IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCLUDING REMARKS I KNOW WE ARE RUNNING BEHIND SCHEDULE. IN WHICH CASE WE'LL JUST SAY WE THANK YOU WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE QUESTIONS TODAY FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF THE LATTER THANK YOUNG. FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO UPDATE. THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS ON THIS IMPORTANT CLEAN UP THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND I AM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AFTER NEXT PANELS. AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS WOULD APPRECIATE- YOU STICKING AROUND IN CASE SIR DISTILL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DIETS ARE REMOTELY. BUT APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SAID- DEAR TO A LOT OF. A LOT OF MEMBERS AND CLEANING UP THESE COMMUNITIES FOR. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS ARE AFFECTED SO THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS COMMON SENSE PERSPECTIVE- WE HAVE- HILDA SOLIS COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE ANGRY BROSTROM ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I JEAN-WILLIAMS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOICS IT WAS GOOD TO GO IN A GENDER ORDER WE CAN HAVE A SUPERVISOR. SO LEASE- BEGIN PLACE. WHO IS- TESTIFYING- VIA REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS. YES THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING- CHAIR SALAS TO THE- JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIAL- COMMITTEE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE TO MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR CONTINUING TO HOLD THESE VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THE EXIDE RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP I ALSO WANT TO THANK IN PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR PRESSING HARD FOR THE AUDIT. OF THE TNCS CLEANUP OF THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IMPACTED BY EXIDE INCLUDING ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE THAT SUPPORTED THAT EFFORT I WANT I WENT UP TO SACRAMENTO EARLIER THIS YEAR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS AUDIT AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY IN ANSWERS TO OUR COMMUNITIES WERE STILL WAITING FOR THE COMPLETE CLEANUP IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE THAT THE STATE TAKE EVERY MEASURE POSSIBLE AND USE EVERY TOOL AT ITS DISPOSAL TO EXPEDITE THE CLEANUP OF ALL PROPERTIES CONTAMINATED BY EXIDE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT HAS VALIDATED THE CONCERNS MANY OF US HAVE HAD ABOUT THE PACE OF THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP AND HOW DTIC IS SPENDING THIS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THE CLEAN UP. THE PACE OF THE CLEAN UP OF THE HOMES NEAR EXIDE IN MY OPINION IS UNACCEPTABLE IS TAKING TOO LONG AND I URGE THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS WITHOUT DELAY AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR A FEW OF THE KEY AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST THE AUDIT REPORT APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIES MEASURES TO HELP CONTROL THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP COSTS. AND AVOID CONTINUING FUTURE COST OVERRUNS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE MEASURES MUST BE IMPLEMENTED AND DTS C. SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEDGE OF THE LEGISLATURE ON ITS PROGRESS REGULARLY PREFER BILLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS SECOND THE PACE OF THE CLEAN UP MUST BE INCREASED WHILE I'M PLEASE IS IT OVER TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP TO DATE THE PACE IS ENTIRELY TOO SLOW. THE LONGER THE CLEAN UP TAKES THE LONGER COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF LEAD CONTAMINATION. AND YES MORE CONTRACTORS MORE CREWS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE NEEDED AND A GREATER URGENCY MUST BE DEMONSTRATED BY D. T. S. C. IN FACT IMPROVING UPON THEIR CONTRACTING CAPABILITIES. AND I KNOW THAT SOON SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC THERE ARE MANY MANY OF FOLKS IT REPRESENT OUR CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING TRADES INDUSTRY THAT WOULD JUST BE HAPPY TO HELP US IN THIS ENDEAVOR. AS THE AUDITOR SUGGESTED DTS CEBU'S BE COMPELLED TO PICK UP THE PACE OF ITS WORK CLEAN UP PUBLISH A SCHEDULE OF WORK AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT SCHEDULE. IN FACT I WOULD GO A STEP FURTHER AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE GOVERNOR CREATE A STRIKE TEAM TO OVERSEE THE CLEANUP AND ADVISE THE ADMINISTRATION ON ACTIONS. THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO SPEED THIS UP. I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PREVIOUS SUPPORT OF A CENTRAL FUNDS TO HELP US CLEAN UP THESE RESIDENTIAL AREAS BUT THE TSC HAS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO GET IT RIGHT. AND IF ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED I WOULD HOPE THAT THE STATE WOULD PUT THAT. THOSE MECHANISMS IN PLACE AND THIRD THE COMMUNITY DESERVES A TIME LINE FOR COMPLETING THE CLEANUP AND IT MUST BE TRANSPARENT AND POSTED IN PUBLIC VENUES FOR ALL TO SEE. THECOMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY EXCISE CONTAMINATION AS YOU KNOW HAVE SUFFER FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND THAT'S WHY I FULLY SUPPORT THE AUDIT'S RECOMMENDATION. THEY BY NO LATER THAN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE DTIC MUST IDENTIFY AND PUBLICIZE THE DATE BY WHICH IT EXPECTS TO COMPLETE ITS CLEANUP OF ALL SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES. FINALLY AND IMPORTANTLY FUNDS MUST BE IDENTIFIED FOR THE CLEANUP OF ALL RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES CONTAMINATED BY EXCISE. IN LIGHT OF X. SITE BANKRUPTCY AND LIQUID. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT DTS C. AND THE STATE IDENTIFY OTHER SUFFICIENT SOURCES OF FUNDING TO COMPLETE THIS RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP. WHETHER THOSE PROCEEDS FROM THE BATTERY TAXACT LOANS FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR OTHER MEANS THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN TO COMPLETE THE IMPORTANT WORK WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE OF CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE NEW INCOMING BLIGHTED ADMINISTRATION TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS THROUGH EPA AND DOJ. ON THIS POINT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE STATE LOOK INTO ESTABLISHING A FUN. FOR THE COMPLETE CLEANUP OF SITES LIKE EXIDE PERHAPS SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND TRUST FUND WHICH RECEIVES APPROPRIATION ANNUALLY FROM THE CONGRESS A RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE CLEANUP OF THE SITES. CAN BE COMPLETED ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEAN UP OR NOT HELD FULLY ACCOUNTABLE AS HAS BEEN THE CASE HERE WITH EXCITED. AND ADDITIONALLY D. TSC NEEDS TO PRESS FORWARD ON THE STALLED CLEANUP IN THE PARKWAY PROPERTIES ADJACENT TO THE RESIDENCES SO THAT ALL PARTS OF THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. ARE THOROUGHLY CLEANED CONCURRENTLY AND EFFICIENTLY MOVING FORWARD. DGSE HAS INDICATED IT DOES NOT HAVE FUNDING FOR THE PARKWAY CLEAN UP. AND TODAY I URGE THE STATE TO FIND OUT FUNDING BY CLEANING UP THE PARK WAYS WE CAN ASSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THIS CLEAN UP ARE DONE THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETE AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE REVISIT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA IS BILL. AB NINE NINE FIVE. WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT TO D. SC. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR VETOED AB NINE NINE FIVE I TRUST THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE WORKING TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL TRULY SAFEGUARD. THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE A- SITES ARE CLEANED UP. IN CONCLUSION AND FINALLY LOS ANGELES COUNTY REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE T. S. C. TO HELP EXPEDITE THIS CLEAN UP. COUNTY STAFF INCLUDING MY OFFICE CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN MONTHLY COORDINATION BECAUSE WITH THE T. S. C. REGARDING THE X. I CLEAN UP. BUT I THINK THIS HAS TO BE DONE MORE REGULARLY AND I WOULD ASK THAT. SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENT ALL ALSO BE MOURNED GAUGE SOME HAVE BUT I WOULD THINK THE FOLLOW UP COULD HELP FACILITATE EVEN MORE. INFORMATION ABOUT CLEAN UP WE CERTAINLY WANT TO HELP THAT AND ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THE COUNTY HAS WORKED TO EXPEDITE THE PERMITTING. PROCESS RELATED TO THE CLEANUP INCLUDING WAVING AT EVEN REDUCING PERMIT FEES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THE COUNTY IS ALSO OBTAIN FUNDING FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARD ABATEMENT IN APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMES NEAR EXIDE BUT YOU AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. WE HAVE HOSTED NEARLY A HUNDRED COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS AND CONDUCTED OVER SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED. BLOOD LEAD TESTS INCLUDING THE TESTING OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY EXIDE. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY POLLUTION IN THEIR FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I WANT TO THANK THE STATE AUDITOR FOR HER IMPORTANT WORK I THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP THE LEAD CONTAMINATION IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE FACILITIES MUCH LIKE EXCITED ANOTHER ONE THAT IS BEING OVER OVER- BEING MONITORED CURRENTLY. OF BY THE DTIC IS QUITE MEDICAL IN THE CITY OF INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE FIRST DISTRICT. TOGETHER WE CAN OVERCOME I BELIEVE THESE CHALLENGES AND DELIVER THE CLEAN UP THAT MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE WAITING FOR. ESPECIALLY THOSE HAD THAT HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES LOST LOVED ONES OR WILL BE WILL BE PLAGUED BY SERIOUS DISEASE AN ILLNESS THE COMMUNITIES OF BELL BOYLE HEIGHTS COMMERCE EAST LA HUNTINGTON PARK. CUT HAY BURNIN AND MAY WOULD ALL DESERVE TO BE RESPECTED AND THEY NEED TO KNOW WHEN A CLEANUP WILL BEGIN AND WILL. END THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER LEE'S AND WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP OBVIOUSLY THIS TAKES A LOT OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL STATE. COUNTY AND LOCAL LEVELS SO APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY WITH THAT LET'S GOING TO MOVE TO MISSILE BROSTROM. PLEASE PROCEED WITH. IN GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AGAIN MY NAME IS IN THE BROSTROM AND I AM ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AT THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS I HAVE WORKED WITH COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE TSC. AND THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I HAVE ADVOCATED FOR MEANINGFUL DGSE REFORM IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. OVER THIS TIME I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF HOW FAILURES AND DGSE HURT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. THE FAILURES AROUND EXIDE CANNOT BE BOILED DOWN TO CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES. INADEQUATE FINANCIAL ASSURANCES OR AGENCY DELAYS. THIS IS ABOUT THE PERMANENTLY ALTERED LIVES OF CHILDREN NEEDLESSLY EXPOSED TO LEAD. LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN OCCURS AT VERY LOW LEVELS AND THERE IS NO CURE FOR LEAD POISONING ONCE A CHILD HAS BEEN EXPOSED. IT IS PERMANENT AND AS A LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES. TO EXPOSE CHILD THIS AUDIT REPRESENTS A LIFETIME OF LEARNING DISABILITIES. A COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND A DIMINISHED OPPORTUNITIES. AND EXCITED IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A GROWING CRISIS FACING THE STATE. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE LIKELY MANY EXCITES ACROSS THE STATE SPREADING TOXICS AND POISONING OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE WE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CLINICAL THE STATE'S OTHER BATTERY RECYCLER WHICH IS ALSO LOCATED NEAR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. DDS IS ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTAMINATED SITES IN CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY THIS PAST YEAR. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DGSE ESTIMATED THAT THERE WEREN'T NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND IDENTIFIED SITES ACROSS THE STATE. AND NOW THE STATE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE LIKELY OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES WAITING TO BE INVESTIGATED AND CHARACTERIZED. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES. AND AT THE SAME TIME FUNDING FOR CLEAN UPS HAS ALL BUT DRIED UP. EXIDE WILL COST THE STATE UPWARDS OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. DTCS ENTIRE BUDGET FOR OTHER ORPHAN SITES IN CALIFORNIA IS BETWEEN FOUR FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS AT TWENTY TWO FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND FIFTY TWO STATE OR FROM SITES EIGHTEEN MILLION ANNUALLY TO SPLIT AMONG SEVENTY FOUR SEVENTY FOUR SITES. THIS MEANS THAT SOME SITES RECEIVE NO CLEAN UP FUNDS. IT MEANS THAT MANY SUSPECTED SITES DON'T GET INVESTIGATED. IT MEANS THAT THE SITES THAT DO RECEIVE FUNDING HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE CHEAPEST CLEANUP OPTION. NOT THE BEST OPTION. THIS PAST WEEK I PARTICIPATED IN A PUBLIC MEETING TO DISCUSS THE REMEDY FOR A P. C. E. T. C. E. PLUME IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN DELANO WE'RE OFFICE IS LOCATED. DGSE CATEGORIZES THE DELANO PLUME AS A PRIORITY ONE HEY. DETAILS HIS TOP PRIORITY FOR CLEAN UP DUE TO AND I QUOTE IMMEDIATE AND ACUTE CONDITIONS REQUIRING A TIME CRITICAL RESPONSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT DGSE DISCOVER THE SITE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OVER TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND THEY ARE JAZZ NOW SELECTING A REMEDY TO CLEAN UP THE SITE. AGAIN DETAILS HIS FAILURE TO ACT QUICKLY AND THIS LACK OF RESOURCES HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR RESIDENTS WHO PAY FOR THIS IN ACTION WITH THEIR HEALTH. TO CONCLUDE DTS IS MANDATE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE AND TO THE PUBLIC. DGSE HAS NOT MET THAT MANDATE AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE PAYING A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR ITS FAILURES. WE NEED BETTER OVERSIGHT AT THE AGENCY AND WE NEED T SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATE CHARACTERIZE AND REMEDIATE CONTAMINATED SITES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SOLUTION REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND A FASHION AND UP SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMATIC AND FEE REFORMS TO FIX THE TSC. AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT WE NEED TO FIND DIFFERENT PATH AND A DIFFERENT AGENCY TO MOVE US FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRECIADO MOST ROSTRUM AND OBVIOUSLY- MAKING SURE THAT WERE HOLDING NOT ONLY DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE BUT TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED. WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO- JANE WILLIAMS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS PLACE. OKAY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS AND GERMAN COURT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOR TO YOU TESTIFIED TODAY- I AM JANE WILLIAMS I ACTUALLY CHAIRED THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE OF THE EXITE CAG. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO WORDS JUST HOW INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS LEAD CONTAMINATION ARE- I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO IS DONE A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO PUT THAT INTO WORDS- IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDER ESTIMATE EXACTLY WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE POVERTY TO PRISON PIPELINE WILL HERE WE'VE GOT THE POISON TO PRISON PIPELINE. IT TAKES ONLY A PEN HEAD OF LEAD TO HAVE A CHILD EXCEED TO SEE YOU SEE YOU BROTHER LOVERS STANDARD AND WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT BASICALLY HAVE A THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION IN THEIR YARDS. WHICH IS BASICALLY THEY'RE LIVING IN A HAZARDOUS WASTE LANDFILL. WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS A CLASSIC ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROBLEM WHERE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REDLINED USE REDLINING POLICIES TO CONCENTRATE LEAD SMELTERS IN EAST LA. EXCITE IS NOT THE ONLY LETS MALTER THERE'S ACTUALLY SIX LEAD SMELTERS. IN EAST LA AND WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS CALLED A CLEANING ANALYSIS WHERE WE LOOK AT. OUR THE LEVELS AS WE GO AWAY FROM EXCITED DROPPING OFF AND THE ANSWER IS NO THEY'RE NOT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE EXCITED IS AT THE CENTER AND THE OTHER OTHER LEAD SMELTERS ARE LIKE IN A RACE AROUND EACH- EXIDE IS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE LONGEST OPERATING THAT'S FILTER IN THE COUNTRY. SO IT COULD BE. A LARGE PROBLEM AND IT FRUSTRATES ME TO NO END AND THE MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE TO NO END THAT. THIS KEEPS THE DETAILS HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILES. NEAR THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED HOMES THE FORTY SIX HUNDRED HOMES THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THAT THIS IS A HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM EAST LA THAT WILL MOST LIKELY IMPACT A MILLION PEOPLE AND SPREAD FOR SQUARE MILES. AND THAT IS WHY WE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRISSY AND THE SPEAKER TO PASS THE BATTERY FEE BILL. WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING AT RESURRECTION CHURCH ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO THINGS THAT WE NEED FOR THE EXCITING TECH TO COMMUNITIES WE NEED A LONG TERM STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. WHICH IS WHAT THE BATTERY FEE BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO. AND WE NEED A DIVORCE. WE NEED A DIVORCE FROM DGSE. DGSE WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED HIM IT MAY INTEREST YOU AS A WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCY. THEY ARE NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. IT CANNOT BE MORE CLEAR. WHEN YOU HEAR THE DIRECTOR SAID THAT PARKING IS THE PROBLEM FOR WHY WE CAN'T GET MORE PEOPLE INTO DOING MORE CLEANUPS THAT THIS AGENCY IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE PAST AND IT IS NOT NOW REALLY DEDICATED ITSELF TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM- YOU KNOW FIRST. THE AGENCY WE COMPLAIN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AUTHORITIES WHILE YOU'RE TALKING TO THE PERSON WHO IS IN THEIR THIRTIETH YEAR NOW. MAKING SURE THAT WHEN EVER INDUSTRY CAME IN AND TRIED TO ATTACK THOSE WITH ORTIZ. WE WERE THERE TO MEET THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THEY HAVE THE MONEY AND THEY STILL CAN'T GET THIS DONE. OKAY LET ME COMPARE AND CONTRAST THIS PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THE STATE HOUSE WHICH IS GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION. ESPECIALLY NOW WITH PERFORATED COMPOUNDS- FOR OUTSIDERS STATE WHO ARE WATCHING WHAT HE WAS GOING ON WITH FOR NEED COMPOUNDS IN CALIFORNIA SAY IT WILL BE. NEXT TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE GREATEST SINGLE ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT THE STATE FACES WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THE CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUNDWATER ARE LARGE. THEY IMPACTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE USE WATER. LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING I GAVE TESTIMONY IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. SINCE THAT TIME THE STATE HAS ENGAGE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND REGIONAL BOARDS HAS ENGAGED IN THE LARGEST GROUNDWATER TESTING EFFORT IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE TESTED THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SAMPLES HUNDREDS OF WELLS NOW THEY'RE ISSUING NEW ORDERS TO STEP OUT FROM WHERE THEY FOUND CONTAMINATION THE STATE HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUST THE COST OF THIS PROBLEM IN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE. IT'S EXPECTED TO COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO RESTORE THE WELLS THEY HAD TO SHUT DOWN A THIRD OF THEIR WEALTH IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OKAY THE WATER AGENCIES OR THE ONE STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE TO FUNDED FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO FIND OF TECHNOLOGIES TO CLEAN UP THE CONTAMINANTS APPROPRIATELY. OKAY SO IN THE ABSENCE OF A FEDERAL PLAN. DURING THIS. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DTS SEES ACTION. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS ENGAGED IN THIS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE PROCESS IT HAS ENGAGED WATER AGENCIES IT IS ENGAGED AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. IT HAS A PLAN. OKAY IT IS SEEKING FEDERAL FUNDING IT WILL BE SEEKING STATE FUNDING IT WILL BE CHARGING ITS CONSUMERS FOR WATER. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT WE'RE GONNA LET THE COMMUNITIES KEEP DRINKING THE CONTAMINATED WATER. NO WE'RE SHUTTING DOWN THE WELLS WERE ENDING THE EXPOSURE THE CONVERSATION IN THE EXCITING TECH TO COMMUNITIES AND YOU STILL IN SOUTH CENTRAL WITH THESE LET'S MELCHER'S. IS REALLY ABOUT HOW LONG WILL WE ALLOW THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE TO SUFFER. AND SO. WHETHER IT'S INCOMPETENCE WHETHER IT IS CULTURAL WHETHER IT IS NEGLIGENCE. LISTEN WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH FIXING THE FOUNDATIONS WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH LEAN SIX SIGMA WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH CULTURAL TRAININGS WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH FOUR SEPARATE DIRECTORS NOW THAT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU TNC. OKAY WE'RE THROWN IN THE TOWEL. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT. YOU CAN YOU SEE THIS YES THIS IS A FILES IN MY OFFICE. ON HERE IT SAYS YES. IN HERE IS THE DECISION ON THE FIFTH- THIS CASE. WHICH WAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IT HAPPENED ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER EXCITED SHUT DOWN. AND IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY RECRUITERS VERSUS TECH COMINCO METALS. IT HELD AT DISPOSAL IN UNITED STATES UNDER CERCLA AND REGRET DOES NOT INCLUDE EMISSIONS TO THE AIR THIS IS THE NINTH CIRCUIT CASE. WE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME AND THE AG TO TIME AND WE SAID DOESN'T THIS REALLY PRECLUDE US FROM EVERY GETTING COST RECOVERY FROM EXCITE. AND THE ANSWER WAS YES WE ARE CELEJ COUNCIL YES. WE ASK UCLA WE ASK UC BERKELEY. WE ASK COLUMBIA SCHOOL LAW WE ALSO HARVARD SCHOOL LAW AND THEY'RE LIKE YES YOU'RE THE NIGHT CIRCUIT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET COST RECOVERY BUT YET DGSE CONTINUES TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND MISS REPRESENT THE PROBLEM. IT'S GOING TO COST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS. AND WE NEED MONEY. AND MORE THAN ANYTHING WE NEED SOMEONE. AN AGENCY THAT CARES. AND I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH YOU I HAVE EIGHTY MEMBERS THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THE EXCITED PROBLEM OURS A SMALL FRACTION OF MY MEMBERS I HAVE A MEMBER THIS ALL THE WAY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HOW A PREFERRED NEAR HUMBOLDT DEALING WITH AN OLD PULP MILLS WITH DIOXIN EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE NOT GETTING ALONG WITH DGSE ON THAT CLEAN UP WE HAVE LUIS OLMEDO WHO IS FIGHTING OVER CHEVRON SITE IN BRAWLEY. HE'S NOT GETTING ALONG WITH THAT FROM THE VERY TOP OF THE STATE FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE STATE THIS AGENCY CANNOT GET. ITS CLEANUPS CORRECTLY CAN I GET IT RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THIS YOU GUYS KNOW OKAY THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS YOU KEEP DOING THE SAME THING BUT EXPECT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. I'M ALL FOR YOU KNOW FIXING THE AGENCY I'M ALL FOR REFORMING THE AGENCY- YOU KNOW I DID EDITORIAL ABOUT. THE GARCIA BILL WE'VE GOT THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH LONG TERM FINANCIAL ASSURANCES THE WHOLE SCHEME IS ABOUT LEADING EXAMINATION BEHIND AND THEN MOVING THAT LIABILITY TO TAXPAYERS THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT LOTS OF SITES. SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE YEAH I MISS WILLIAMS PLEASE WRAP IT UP DOING THE SAME THING. AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. WE NEED EITHER TO TAKE THE EXCITED CLEAN UP OUT OF DGSE. AND PUT IT INTO ITS OWN AGENCY LIKE WE DIMAS SAN GABRIEL WATER QUALITY CONTROL AUTHORITY- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPRESSED I'VE BEEN WITH ORANGE COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND THEY'RE- JUMPING IN ON THE P. FAST ISSUE THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING- MAYBE IT NEEDS MAYBE X. I CLEAN IT NEEDS TO GO TO A LOCAL AGENCY- MAYBE THE GOVERNOR NEEDS TO CREATE. YOU KNOW BLUE RIBBON PANEL THAT WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THE SAME THING WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WHEN I HEAR THAT PARKING IS THE PROBLEM. FOR KIDS CLEANING UP KIDS. PARKS IN KIDS DAY CARE CENTERS AND KIDS HOMES WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH THE LEAD EVERYWHERE WHEN IT TAKES EACH PINPRICK OF LEAD TO POISON A CHILD I KNOW I'VE GOT THE WRONG PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE CLEAN UP SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT- I CANNOT EMPHASIZE TO YOU ENOUGH ABSOLUTE FRUSTRATION. OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE GROUND TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS AGENCY AND TRYING TO GET THEIR THEIR HOMES CLEANED UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT TESTIMONY- IN APPRECIATED I THINK THIS PANEL IS DEFINITELY VOICING THE FRUSTRATIONS AND CONCERNS- THAT WE'RE HEARING NOT ONLY THE COMMITTEE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO- WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND NOW WITH THAT. WE HAVE THREE MORE AGENDA ITEMS TO GO THROUGH AN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MINUTES AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PUBLIC. COMMENTS THAT ARE IN QUEUE WAITING FOR US AT EACH OF THE REMOTE- TESTIMONY STATION SO WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF THERE'S A ADDITIONAL IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS IF NOT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. AND THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR. ALLOWING US TO EXPEDITE SOME OF THIS BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO PANELS OF TAKEN SO LONG. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE WE'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE IN ANOTHER UPDATE. ON AUDIT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. I BELIEVE- MISS WE HAVE MISALIGNED HOW WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WE HAVE A- GEORGE PURSUIT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION I MISS HOW IF YOU COULD JUST. LAID OUT FOR US QUICKLY WE'D APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE VERY QUICKLY THIS IS AN AUDIT WE ISSUED A YEAR AGO. ON IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND IT WAS AN AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT JUST RELATIONS RELATED TO. QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR PROCESS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION THREE KEY ISSUES IN THE REPORT AND THEN I'LL TALK OF A VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE MADE REPORT. SO THREE KEY FINDINGS- THE DEPARTMENT OF DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT INDUSTRIALIZATION. HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS AND ENSURE THAT THERE ARE INADEQUATE NUMBER OF Q. AND HE'S AVAILABLE- TO ASSESS WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A BEEN A SHORTAGE- AND IT'S BEEN OCCURRING AND GETTING WORSE OVER TIME SO THAT WAS THE FIRST KEY ISSUE. SECOND ISSUE WAS- DIVISION OF WORKER'S COMPENSATIONS PRACTICES FOR DISCIPLINING OCULAR MAYES REALLY FOR US RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND- AND- BRIEFLY WHAT THE ISSUE THERE IS IT IF THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A FEW ANY. THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR THOSE ALLEGATIONS TO BE INVESTIGATED WHAT WE FOUND DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT IS THAT THE- DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION WOULD WAIT UNTIL THAT QB WAS UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND DENY THAT REAPPOINTMENT SO YOU'RE LOSING IT YOU AND ME FROM THE SYSTEM. THAT'S ALREADY ARE SUFFERING FROM A SHORTAGE OF GERMANY SO WE REALLY HAD SOME ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THAT AND THEN THE THIRD KEY FINDING WAS RELATED TO. DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FAILING TO ENSURE THAT THESE QUEUE NB REPORTS THAT GO TO WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. ARE AT WORK WERE WELL DONE OR WERE MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT THEIR QUEUE NB IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED I WAS REPORTS OF THREE KEY ISSUES. WE HAVE SEVEN G. RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION DEPARTMENT. INVESTOR RELATIONS CLEARLY. A TEAR. WAS REALLY TO THE KEY AND A SHORTAGE WITH THAT THE- NEEDED DO MORE- AND WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR A FEW MONTHS AGO. DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. ANNE'S AVAILABLE. ARE COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND DEMAND HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR. ALL THESE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATIONS IT'S INCREASED BY 37% OVER THE FIVE YEARS WE LOOKED AT- THE SUPPLY OF CUNY'S HAS DECREASED BY ABOUT 12% SO THERE'S A HUGE. HUGE NUMBER OF OUR- ARE THESE EVALUATIONS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BUT WE'RE LOOKED SUFFERING FROM A SHORTAGE OF Q. AND ME SO WE ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH OUR RECOMMENDATION. TO ACTIVELY RECRUIT AND INCREASE THE POOL OF CUNY'S AVAILABLE TO WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY- THE AS I SAID THE AUDIT WAS ISSUED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE EXPECTING OUR ONE YEAR RESPONSE LATER THIS WEEK. REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO GET THAT RESPONSE- A LITTLE BIT EARLY SO THAT I COULD PROVIDE. THE ONE YEAR STATUS PERHAPS MISTER- THEY REPRESENT REPRESENTATIVE FROM MINE. YOU FOR A WORKERS COMP. OR DIVISION WORKERS CAPTURES ME- CAN CAN GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A ONE YEAR RESPONSE OTHER RESPONSES I'M REFERRING TO. ARE THE SIX MONTH RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. SO AS OF JUNE- WE FELT THAT THE STATUS OF. BWC THIS RECOMMENDATION TO REALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. ANNE'S IS REALLY AS WE CALL IT PENDING. SO BASICALLY WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR A SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS THEY INTEND TO RECRUIT MORE Q. ANNE'S. BUT REALLY HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD WITH THAT PROCESS. ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE I KNOW MEMBERS WHO WERE WORKING ON LAST YEAR THERE WAS SOME LEGISLATION. WAS RELATED TO THE FEES THAT COMMUNITIES CAN CHARGE AS WE INDICATED IN THE AUDIT REPORT THOSE FEES HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. SO THEY THEY NEED UPDATING OUR SOON BECAUSE EVEN WITH JUST THE CPI IF YOU USE JUST A AN INFLATION INDICATOR. THOSE FEES WOULD GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF SUCH. SUCH A LONG TIME. SO WE HAD ONE ONE KEY RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THE SHORTAGE OF Q. AMIS REALLY GOT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES ADDRESS THAT FEE SCHEDULE. LOOK TO SEE WHERE THAT THE SPECIALTIES ARE THAT NEED. TO BE INCREASED BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS BASED ON SPECIALTY. ALSO WE FELT THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT. THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE AS FAR AS SEPARATING DISCIPLINE FROM REAPPOINTMENT WE HAD TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THERE ONE WE FEEL THAT THEY'VE PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THEY DEVELOP POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT REALLY. DEFINE THEIR INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR DISCIPLINE VERSUS REAPPOINTMENT AND ESTABLISHING TIMELINES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHAT WE FOUND IS- SOME Q. AND THESE WERE REQUESTING A HEARING TO. PRESENT THEIR CASE AND IT WAS TAKING DIVISION OF WORKERS COMP- LONG TIME TO GET THOSE HEARING SET UP THE CUNY WOULD JUST AGREE TO SETTLE SO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS A Q. AND ME. SO WE FELT THAT THERE WERE SOME SIGNIFICANT DUE PROCESS CONCERNS THERE. OUR CONCLUSION AT THE SIX MONTH RESPONSE AGAIN BACK IN JUNE. IS THAT THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A POLICY. BUT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRING THEY'RE NOT ENFORCING IT AND REQUIRING THEIR STAFF TO FALL THAT POLICY SO REALLY NOT A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO THAT. THE OTHERRECOMMENDATION WAS TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO RE APPOINTMENT SO AS OPPOSED TO DISCIPLINE WHAT KIND OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SHOULD THEY HAVE FOR. ASSURING THAT THEY THEIR REAPPOINTMENT PROCESS FOR CUNY'S IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ACTION AT LEAST AS OF JUNE. I KNOW ACTION BY THE DEPARTMENT- TO IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DEVELOP THEM. A TRAINED STAFF ON THEM BUT CETERA SO UNFORTUNATELY NOT NOT MUCH PROGRESS THERE. WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITY OF REPORTS WE MADE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE WANTED THEM TO CREATE A PLAN TO CONTINUOUS REVIEW- THE QUALITY IN THE TIMELINESS OF THESE REPORTS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THESE REPORTS TO HAVE BE OF HIGH QUALITY. SO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES CAN USE THOSE REPORTS. RATHER THAN ASKING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT DELAYS A WORKER A DETERMINATION SO THAT THAT WORKERS CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE CARE THAT. THE WORKER NEEDS- WITH RESPECT TO THAT. RECOMMENDATION WE FEEL THE DEPARTMENT IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED IT IT PROVIDED US A POLICY BUT IT HAS NOT PROVIDED A PLAN. FOR IT'S REVIEW OF REPORTS FOR QUALITY WE EXPECTED TO SEE A METHODOLOGY WE EXPECTED TO SEE. HOW MANY REPORTS ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY ETCETERA SO THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE THERE. THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION WAS RELATED TO- DEVELOPING A PROCESS ONCE YOU REVIEW THOSE REPORTS PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR. INDEED HAVE YOU SEE SO THAT THERE CAN BE CHANGES TO THE CURE ME PROCESS TO IMPROVE. THE QUALITY OF THOSE REPORTS THE TIMELINESS OF THOSE REPORTED CETERA. THIS ONE AS OF JUNE DELIVERY SHE SAID IT WAS STILL DEVELOPING A PROCESS FOR THAT ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR. SO AGAIN MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE- THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION WAS RELATED TO THE APPEALS BOARD IT'S A- THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO. CREATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES TO NOTIFY. DPW SEE THAT THEY WERE REJECTING REPORTS DO YOU HAVE YOU SEE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY REPORTS WERE BEING REJECTED BY WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT TO DO AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT CUNY'S WORK OR CREATING REPORTS THAT WERE SUFFICIENT FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES. IT ALSO LIMITED- NEED OF UC'S ABILITY TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE CUNY'S TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE MEETING THE STANDARDS. ARE THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE WORKERS COMP JUDGE JUDGES AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE REPORTS. ON THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED POLICIES AND AN EXAMPLE OF A- REJECTED REPORT SO WE FELT THAT THEY HAD. SKEWS ME I'M TRYING TO RUSH- THEY HAD DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND A PROCESS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES TO NOTIFY DPW SEE THAT IS THE ONE RECOMMENDATION THAT HAS BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED WE SAW AN EXAMPLE. OF A REJECTED REPORT AND HOW THAT WAS REPORTED BACK TO BE OF YOU SEE AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT NOTIFICATION. THAT THAT REPORT HAD BEEN REJECTED. THE FINAL. IS TIED TO THIS- AND IT IT WAS TO CREATE POLICIES AND TO IMPLEMENT A PROCESS TO TRACK. OF THESE Q. ON THE REPORTS THAT ARE REJECTED BY WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY ARE BEING REJECTED. IS IT SPECIFIC YOU ARE MAYES WHO ARE HAVING MANY OF THEIR REPORTS REJECTED WHAT'S THE NATURE AND REASON WHY- THESE REPORTS ARE BEING REJECTED IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE AS FAR AS- THE QUALITY AND IT THE TRAINING THAT YOU ARE MEANS RECEIVE SO THAT THEY PUT TOGETHER A REPORT THAT AGAIN IS SUFFICIENT. FOR THE WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES TO USE. THIS RECOMMENDATION WE FEEL IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED AGAIN AS OF JUNE. ARE THEY PROVIDED A POLICY FOR TRACKING REJECTED REPORTS BUT DIDN'T INCLUDE IN THAT. POLICY HOT WHEN THEY WILL- REVIEW THOSE REPORTS YOU KNOW THE REJECTED REPORTS ARE THAT THE- THE TRACKING OF THOSE TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS ARE WHAT ARE THE REASONS- THAT WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES ARE CITING. FOR REJECTING THOSE REPORTS BECAUSE THEY IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE BEING REJECTED. ARE YOU NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCY AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN THESE. ARE ARE PUTTING REPORTS TOGETHER THAT ARE SUFFICIENT FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES TO MAKE DECISIONS. SO THOSE WERE THE SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS- AGAIN WE'RE EXPECTING OUR THE ONE YEAR RESPONSE LATER THIS WEEK WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE IT FOR THE HEARING TODAY- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T GET IT TO US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSILE APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THE THOROUGH OVERVIEW IN THE LEGISLATION WAS ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MEDICAL LEAVE- MEDICAL LEGAL FEES FOR OUR QUEUE AMIS ARE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATORS. I TO BE INTERESTED IN SEEING HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME OF THOSE RESPONSES TODAY KNOW YOU'RE EXPECTING A FORMAL RESPONSE LATER THIS WEEK. FROM MISTER PURSUIT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE TIME OF COLLUDED. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PANDEMIC. WE STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A- ADDED SUPPLY OF Q. IN ME IS OUR- AVAILABLE FOR WORK I WITH A WE'RE JUST GONNA GO TO MOVE STRAIGHT INTO MR PRAYER SOTO AS PRESENTATION I BELIEVE HE IS- JOINING US AS WELL. MISTER SOTO IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE IF YOU COULD PLEASE- PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRESS ON THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DIVISION'S QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR. FOR Q. M. B. PROCESS IT MADE THE DIVISION SUBMITTED A SIX MONTH STATUS REPORT WHICH WAS PUBLISHED ON THE STATE AUDITOR'S WEBSITE. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE THEN THE DIVISION IS COMPLETED THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT AND ARE IMPLEMENTING ALL THE NECESSARY CHANGES. AS WITH ALL STATE AGENCIES OF COURSE VW THREE AND HAD TO QUICKLY ADAPT TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO ENSURE THAT INJURED. OR SICK WORKERS CAN ACCESS THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED. IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING ALL THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS THE DIVISION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH.

INITIAL COST PROJECTIONS USING DATA ANALYSIS FROM PASSED YOU'LL BE REPORTING TRENDS SHOW THAT THE SCHEDULE HOLDS THE POTENTIAL TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THE INCOME FOR PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING IN OUR SYSTEM.

I'M JUST WONDERING HOW MANY QB'S ARE THERE IN THE SPECIALTY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS ONE OF SPECIALTY THAT WE DO NOT HAVE MANY I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THERE IF THERE WAS ONE REALLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS COME UP. CLEARLY CLEARLY THAT IS A SPECIALTY THAT NEEDS BARGAINING THAT WE NEEDED TO DO NEED TO BRING THOSE THOSE KEEP THOSE DOCTORS INTO OUR SYSTEM. YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE- THAT YOU WOULD I WANT TO PRIORITIZE I GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PANDEMIC IN WITH COVE IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST DEALING SPECIFICALLY NOT ONLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS YEAR BUT PART OF TENSELY IN THE FUTURE% AS WELL- HAS DELIVERY SHE DONE ANYTHING TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE TYPES OF. SCENARIOS WELL WE'RE WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT THE DATA. THAT WE ARE RECEIVING IN A WE ARE REACHING OUT TO AS I MENTIONED EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITIES- WE ARE REACHING OUT TO LARGE HEALTH PROVIDER GROUPS. AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW FEE SCHEDULE A DOCTOR'S WILL FIND IT BENEFICIAL TO BECOME HUMAN NEEDS- WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE DO WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING THE- CAN DEFINITELY BE A CODE NINETEEN PRESUMPTION BILLS. WE HOPE THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS YOU KNOW ARE ACCEPTING THE CLAIMS OF INJURED WORKERS WHO DO GET SICK ON THE JOB. THANK YOU AND I KNOW WE'VE- WE'VE PASSED THAT LEGISLATION HERE THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AB EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN TO TRANSIT. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE MEDICAL LEAD. MEDICAL LEGAL FEES SCHEDULE ARE YOU ANTICIPATING ANY REIMBURSEMENT CHANGES TO THE FEE SCHEDULE. ARM TO OUR PROPOSED TO OUR PROPOSED SCHEDULE YEAH- I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANYTHING AT THIS TIME WE ARE IN OUR RULE MAKING PERIOD WE ARE GOING TO ACCEPT. ALL PUBLIC COMMENTS REGARDING MEN'S WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL HEARING- WE WILL LIKE IT WE A LOT UP. TAKE KERR WILL BE ABLE TO THEM AND MALL HAVE A FINAL COULD HAVE BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS. GOOD BUT ALSO FUTURE A FEW SLOW TWEAKS THEY'RE GOT IT AND I KNOW WE ARE OFTEN BEEN HEARING IN THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN HEARING- FROM PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FEE SCHEDULE BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IS THERE A MECHANISM TO RESOLVE DISPUTES EITHER THROUGH THE IBR OR THROUGH COURT R. THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. WELL WE WILL HAVE A- SET THE SCHEDULE FOR THIS. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF THE BILL THAT WOULD GO TO OUR INDEPENDENT BILL REVIEW PROCESS- WHICH- IS MANDATED BY STATUTE WHICH WOULD GO TO A REVIEWER. AND INDEPENDENT THE BILL REVIEW ORGANIZATION RIGHT NOW THAT'S MAXIMUS FEDERAL SERVICES WHO WOULD RESOLVE THE DISPUTE. GOT IT JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ON FOLLOW UP ON THE FEE SCHEDULE NOW I UNDERSTAND- THAT INSTEAD OF SIMPLY INCREASING THE EXISTING FEE SCHEDULE ONE YEAR AGO AS A STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED. IDW SEES LATEST PROPOSALS TO REVAMP THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE FEE SCHEDULE THE NEW PROPOSAL WOULD FORCE CAN BE USED TO WORK AT A FLAT RATE AND WOOD. AND- HINDER THEIR ABILITY BE PAID ON AN HOURLY BASIS IS DO I HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY. BUT WE DO HAVE A FLAT RATE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO HAVE CONSISTENCY AND CONSISTENCY IN OUR SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE- DIRECTLY- OF CENTRAL YOU KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING GOOD QUALITY REPORT WE DO HAVE A FLAT FEE- AND RIGHT NOW- IT'S INCLUDED- IT'S THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DOLLARS WITH A TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OF RECORDS BUT IF THERE ARE MORE RECORDS THAN THAT THEN THAT THE RECORDS ARE PAID AT A HIGHER PRICE. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE AVERAGE REPORT RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES ABOUT THE RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS- DIFFICULT THIS CAN GO UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PAGES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED TO THE POSITION TO REVIEW- WE HAVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS BOTH PRO PROVIDERS WHO CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO. THE WAY TO PROGRESS IN DROUGHT WE THINK THAT THIS WILL THIS WILL WORK WELL I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US WE'D LIKE TO GET THE SCHEDULE- ABOUT A YEAR OR SO TO SEE HOW IT'S WORKING OUT OF THEM AND THEN- YOU KNOW WE- CAN MOVE FORWARD. GOT IT AND WHEN YOU. THE PROPOSAL. FEES SCHEDULE TO REACH OUT TO THE QUEUE MEAN IT'S JUST KIND UNDER. WHY THIS OVER WOULD HAVE. JUST IN TERMS OF IN. ON THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL CARE. WELL AS WE DID WE DID- AB STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT. WERE REPRESENTED BY GROUPS WE DID IN JUNE POSTED PROPOSAL- OF THE SPEED SCHEDULE AND WE DID GET QUITE A BIT OF RESPONSE FROM THE QUEUE IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THEM ON THEIR EFFORTS TO REVIEW TO REVIEW WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND BASED ON THAT. WE PUT OUR FINAL PROPOSAL OUT IN OCTOBER TO DID HAVE SEVERAL UPTICKS IN THE INLAND. REGENERATION ISSUE I THINK REGARDING- PAID TRIBUTE. AND SEVERAL MODIFIERS. GOT IN JUST A FEW FINAL. BECAUSE I KNOW NEED TO MOVE ON WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS ROOM BY TWELVE THIRTY- JUST QUICKLY I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOU CAME OUT WITH FLAT FEE OF THE SCHEDULE BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING. WELL WE HAD A PREVIOUS HEARING IN TERMS OF. MAKING SURE THAT. NOT ONLY DO WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF Q. AND HE'S- BUT ENSURING THAT THE QUALITY IS THERE FOR. PATIENTS AS WELL. WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE QUALITY REVIEW REPORTS WE HAVE ARE SUB COMMITTEE THEY'VE ALREADY MET THEY ARE REVIEWING REPORTS RIGHT NOW- WE WILL GET REPORT WE'LL GET- REPORTS THEY WILL REPORT TO OUR EXECUTIVE MEDICAL DIRECTOR. WHO WILL BEGIN ISSUE A FINAL REPORT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WITH RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW WE AS TO HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE SYSTEM- SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT TO SEE WHAT STEPS WE CAN TAKE IN THE PROCESS PART OF IT WE- WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON THE PEACE IN THE QUALITY. COMPONENTS BUT THEN WE HAVE TO WORK ON PROP IN THE PROCESS ISSUES. BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE. THE FRICTIONAL COSTS ARE REALLY HAPPY IN OUR SYSTEM I THINK WE PAY MORE IN FRICTIONAL COSTS MANY OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY AND- WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CREATE IS CREATE MORE EFFICIENCIES LOOK HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM. I THINK THIS'LL THIS'LL BE A GOOD STEP FORWARD. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THE AUDITOR HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF PROCESS AND THE- THE HEARINGS AND HOW THOSE ARE CONDUCTED TO ACTUALLYIMPROVE EFFICIENCY- SO I DO. HOPE YOU TAKE THOSE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. HELP YOU. WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- MR MORLOCK FAIRLY QUICKLY HOPEFULLY BECAUSE WE STILL GOT IT WE WANT TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WILL TAKE LONGER THAN YOU'RE TELLING ME HOW SHORTER TIME IS- JUST WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION MISTER PURCELL OO WHY DOES IT TAKE AN AUDIT. WHY DID IT TAKE AN AUDIT- I THINK WE- IN TERMS IN TERMS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF REVIEWING QUALITY WE WERE TASKED TO PROVIDE QUALITY REPORTS- I THINK OVER THE YEARS VARIOUS MEASURES OF REFORM. WE HAD STAFF THAT WERE DEDICATED TO DOING CERTAIN TASKS BUT NOT OTHERS- SO. I THINK I THINK IT WAS JUST A QUESTION OF HAVING- UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR SYSTEM- AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DEAL YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ACTUAL ACTUAL ISSUES THAT WE SAW BUT WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE FEE SCHEDULE FOR QUITE A WHILE IT WAS RIGHT IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX R. BECAUSE OF COURSE- THERE IS UP THERE IS THAT A BANDAGE OR HERE IS THAT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS THE OPTION THERE TO GO AND HOURLY BILLING PEOPLE WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE REPORT WORK WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPTIONS AND ALSO WE HAVE. SEVERAL REPORTS FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES RAND CORPORATION TELLING US THE FEE SCHEDULE WAS ACTUALLY REASONABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WAS OFFERING AND SO WE KIND OF BUT. WE KIND OF. WENT ON NOT. IN TERMS OF THE AND THE SPECIAL. IN THE- SB EIGHT. THREE INTO. THIRTEEN TOOK AWAY VERY. COMPONENT FROM CUBA REVIEW THE RETREAT. THOSE ARE TREATED ISSUE. TWENTY FIFTY REGARDING THAT TO. PROVIDE IN WORKER. WAS DECIDED BY A Q. A SB SIXTY TOOK THE AWAY GIVE THAT THE END. MEDICAL REVIEW- WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT THAT POINT THAT- THE NUMBER OF Q. AND THE REQUESTED WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY AT THAT POINT. BUT WE FOUND OUT IN CASES IN LITIGATED CASES WHERE WORKERS ARE REPRESENTED WE HAVE MORE Q. M. B. I REQUEST. PANEL REQUESTED WE HAD BEFORE- SO I THINK A LOT I THINK SOME OF IT HAD TO DO WITH ONE. WE HAVE STAFF DEDICATED TO. GOING AND LOOKING QB DOESN'T PROCESS.

THE AVERAGE COST OF A TWO BEDROOM WAS FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT WAS THE ONLY HOUSING WE COULD FIND THAT WAS BEFORE WE MOVED TO SONOMA COUNTY AND GOT DISPLACED BY THE TUBBS FIRE. WHICH IS WHY NOW WE LIVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN A DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER. AS A FAMILY OF SIX AND THAT'S BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT. OVER THE DECADE WE'VE DEALT WITH. IN THIS STATE. AS I'VE WATCHED THE CORRUPTION AND THE ANTICS OF THIS LEGISLATURE MOST RECENTLY. DUE TO A PANDEMIC THAT NOW HAS MY CHILDREN ZOOM SCHOOLING SO SAYS THINK ISN'T REALLY GOING TO WORK FOR ME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IF YOU COULD- PLEASE PROCEED WITH THAT HOW YOUR COMMENTS ON TODAY'S HEARING- WE ARE TRYING TO. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO ASSIST AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

BUT ALSO OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXICS AND SUBSTANCE CONTROL.

OFFERED JUST A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS IN A HOME WHERE THEY ARE NOT GETTING CONTINUALLY. POISON AND YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES WHO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE FOLKS. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF EXIDE CLOSED DOORS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THE BRANCH OF THE BANKRUPTCY JUST WENT THROUGH AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES. WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR THE CLEANUP WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO AFTER THE EXCITED PEOPLE. ONE OF. IN ADDITION TO THAT. THESE AGENCIES WHICH ARE SET UP AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BOGUS CLAIMS WHY THE CLEANUP CANNOT HAPPEN. I MEAN WE ARE IN TWENTY TWENTY PARKING CANNOT BE AN ISSUE.

BECAUSE TODAY'S WORK HERE FOR THE PAST THREE HOURS. WAS A JOKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAY I ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM. IF NOT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS AND WITH THAT I DO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD PLEASE. PUBLIC COMMENT PERHAPS WE WILL START- FIRST IN I DON'T KNOW WHO WE HAVE QUEUED UP ON THE SCREEN BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OUR OAKLAND STATION ARE LOS ANGELES STATION OR SAN DIEGO STATION. HI I'M JACOB ROSENBERG IN THE PRESIDENT CCM SWITCHES THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY AND FIRST I WANT TO THANK J. LACK IN THE AUDITOR. FOR CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE D. W. C. ON THESE ISSUES AND WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU TO CONTINUE MONITORING YOUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT- FOR QUITE AWHILE. YOUR YOUR YEAR AFTER THE AUDIT WAS RELEASED ON MONTHS AFTER THE LAST STAKEHOLDER MEETING WE MET FOR OVER TWENTY HOURS. AND NOW WE JUST HAVE A PROPOSAL MADE. NOW THE PROPOSED FEE SCHEDULE WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT WAS AGREED TO IN THE- STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS BUT NO FEE SCHEDULES GOING TO SATISFY EVERYONE. THIS SCHEDULE WILL PROVIDE SOME REYES FOR MOST% VALUATIONS MOST VALUATION IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL ATTRACT MORE ORTHOPEDIC EVALUATORS SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S ACCOMPLISHING ONE OF THE GOALS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE EFFECT IS GOING TO BE ON THE ENTIRE QUEUE ME POPULATION THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MONITORED VERY CLOSELY. I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF EVALUATOR SPECIALTY EVALUATORS TELL ME THAT THE FEE SCHEDULES NOT ADEQUATE FOR THEM. AND SO EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A MINORITY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OVERALL. AVAILABILITY OF CUNY'S. MY BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THE BE FURTHER DELAYS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEDULE IT'S ALREADY PUSHED OUT TO APRIL FIRST I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT IS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THAT. I'M AFRAID IS GOING TO BE EVEN FURTHER DELAYS BECAUSE OF. PRESSURE FROM PAYERS. I KNOW THAT- EVERYBODY REALIZES QB'S HAVEN'T HAD A EVEN A COLDER REYES IN FIFTEEN YEARS. I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT THEIR CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE FEE SCHEDULE THAT THAT REALLY NEED TO BE CLARIFIED IF THEY'RE NOT CLARIFY THERE'S GOING TO BE GREATLY INCREASED FRICTIONAL COSTS. NOT SURE THE WC THINKING IS ON THESE- ON THESE PARTS OF THE PROPOSAL. WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THEM BEFORE AND FRANKLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SATISFACTORY ANSWER. SO HOPEFULLY THE D. W. C. WILL CHOOSE TO CLARIFY SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF ELIMINATING THEM IS JUST A QUESTION OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE SCHEDULE. OUR HOPE IS THAT THE D. W. SEASON TO CONTINUE TO BE COLLABORATIVE BUT AGAIN WE NEED THE AUDITOR AND THE JAILER COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO. MONITOR THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET SOME OF THAT CLARITY FROM D. W. C. LATER ON THIS WEEK AND FORMAL RESPONSE TO THE AUDITORS- RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT MORE THAN HAPPY TO- HELP FOLLOW UP AS WELL I KNOW MISTER PERSONA STILL LISTENING IN. AND SO- WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE OAKLAND STATION IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL. COMMENT IN OAKLAND.

THERE'S A QUESTION FROM ONE OF THE MEMBERS. SAID WHY DID IT TAKE AN AUDIT WELL THE AUDIT WAS THE RESULT ACTUALLY IS THE COMMITTEE MAY RECALL A LAWSUIT CONCERNING UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS FOR THE PWC DID NOT COOPERATE. R. UNTIL CRITICAL DEPOSITIONS WERE TAKEN. AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS ARE WRITTEN BY MR PAYER SO TO WAS THAT THEY HAD OTHER THINGS GOING ON AND THAT WAS CORRECT- THEY WERE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS THAT WERE BEING CARRIED OUT AND ELAINE HOW ADDRESS LOS. NOW SHERMAN SALAS YOU HAD ASSEMBLY BILL CALLING FOR A 50% COLA INCREASE WHICH WAS A TRUE COLA INCREASE BUT NOT A RACIST. MR PURCELL SAID FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. THE CURE ME COMMUNITY HOUSING OPERATE. I UNDERSTAND FROM TELL STORIES OF THE COALITION OF PROFESSIONAL PHOTOCOPIERS THEY'VE HAD DELAYS FOR FIVE YEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO THERE IS A PREVALENT THEME HERE. A COAL REYES IS NOT A REYES IT IS JUST PUTTING THE QB'S WHERE THEY ARE IN THE BIG CONCERN FOR THE QUEUE ME CRISIS IF THE INJURED WORKERS. DOUBTS THE FRICTIONAL COST THAT MOST OF US KNOW EXIST FOR THE INJURED WORKERS. THE FRICTIONAL COSTS FOR THE KERRIER IS MINOR COMPARED TO THE IMPACT ON THE INJURED WORKERS. RECORD INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY BEEN DOCUMENTED ON WORKERS COMP. THE SMALL THINGS THAT ARE HOLDING UP.

LACK. ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO YOU- THE AUDITOR. AND THE GREAT WORK THAT. SHE AND HER TEAM HAVE DONE IN. SHAPING WHITE ON SOME ONGOING SYSTEMATIC ISSUES RELATED TO. A DWTS MANAGEMENT THE QB PROGRAM- I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP DURING THIS HEARING- NUMBER ONE THE COBIT ISSUE WHICH- CHAIRMAN SALAS BROUGHT UP IS VERY PERTINENT ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW DURING THESE TRYING TIMES- THERE BEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF KOBE CLAIMS FILED. IN CALIFORNIA BY INJURED WORKERS. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN DENIED AND- MISTER PARIS SO DOES YOUR MIND THAT THERE MAY WELL BE ZERO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SHE IS CORRECT THERE ARE ZERO AND THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO- FOR THE TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE QUEUE IN THE INDUSTRY. THE D. W. C. HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ATTRACTING ONE PHYSICIAN TO ASSESS THIS ISSUE AND NOW. THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG ISSUE AS WE CAN ALL HELP WITH THIS PANDEMIC. DELAY LAST MONTH THE WCI ARE BE ISSUED A STUDY CALLED COST IMPACT OF MEDICAL CARE DELAYS IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THE STUDY FOUND MANY INTERESTING THINGS ONE OF THEM WAS THE CLAIMS OF SOFT TISSUE INJURIES THAT HAVE JUST ONE MONTH OF DELAY BEFORE RECEIVING FIRST MEDICAL SERVICE CARE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INDEMNITY AND MEDICAL COSTS THAN SIMILAR CLAIMS WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE DELAYS. THERE'S A LOT MORE DATA IN THE STUDY I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE DETAILS BUT THE CONCLUSION IS THAT DELAYS IN TREATMENT INCREASED MEDICAL AND INDEMNITY COSTS. SIMPLY PUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH TO LET ME IS THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH Q. AND NEEDS A YEAR AGO WHEN THE AUDITOR FOUND LESS THEIR CONTINUE NOT TO BE ENOUGH TODAY. AND THE LACK OF Q. AND HE'S RESULT IN DELAYS WORSE MEDICAL OUTCOMES FOR INJURED WORKERS WORST FINANCIAL OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS. MR PERRY SAID IT DID CORRECTLY SPEAK ABOUT THE FACT THAT A FRICTIONAL COSTS THAT ARE PLAGUING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF SHARED IS THIS WHOLESALE REVISION OF THE KEY SCHEDULE THAT TIME FRONT OF US. WHILE THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE FOR SOME PROVIDERS WE KNOW THAT ANY SORT OF MASSIVE CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO RESULT INSTRUCTIONAL ISSUES- MR PERSONNEL SAID THE PROVIDERS WANTED A FLAT FEE UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE PROVIDERS. FROM DAY ONE HAVE BEEN ASKING TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AS PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN BE PAID BY THE HOUR- JUST LIKE ATTORNEYS ACCOUNTANTS AT CETERA BUT- WE WERE CLEARLY TOLD BY D. W. C. AND BY PAYERS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT US TO WORK ON AN HOURLY BASIS THEY ONLY WANT TO BE PAID ON A FLAT FEE BASIS. AND ANYBODY THAT'S HIRED WORKERS DO YOU WORK ON A FLAT FEE BASIS- YOU KNOW THAT INCENTIVIZES SPEED NOT QUALITY INDIA- THE AUDITOR CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THERE ARE SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUES. WITH REPORT QUALITY SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT COME WITH SUCH A CHANGE. THAT BEING SAID WE ARE OVERDUE SIGNIFICANTLY FOR SUCH A CHANGE AFTER. DR ROSENBERG'S CONCERN OF ABOUT WHY. WE ARE HERE A YEAR LATER AFTER AUDIT ALL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AS A STRONG OF A PEN JUST THIS. AND OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK ON APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. LOADING I WANT TO THANK J.
