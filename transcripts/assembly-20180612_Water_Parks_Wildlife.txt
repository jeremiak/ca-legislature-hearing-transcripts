OF THE YEAR NEGATIVELY HAS THE IMPACT OF THE SECOND OF SMOKING. IS ARE SOMETIMES EVEN MORE DETRIMENTAL THAN DIE IF AND A SMOKER HIMSELF WELL. AND THEN ALSO AS A NON SMOKER A HOW MANY TIMES. POWERED. PEOPLE WANT NON SMOKING. A. THEIR RIGHTS ARE INFRINGED I KNOW THIS IS VARIAS SENSITIVITY ISSUE. THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO A SMOKE. OH YES I. UNDERSTAND THAT THE HIGHWAY AS STRONG AS SO. THAT THE SMOKE CAN BE CONFINED THAT WOULD NOT IMPACT. TEACH MATH PEOPLE US AROUND THE. A. BUT THAT DOES FAR. BUT. IN MOST CASES. THE SMOKER WAS JUST A FLOOR ANYWHERE THAT THE WIND BLOW SOUTH. AND THE PEOPLE ARE AROUND THE SMOKER. A WOODED BE. IN VIOLENT TORTILLA WHAT IN HELL. AND THEN THAT IMPACT ON OUR EARS ARE VERY DETRIMENTAL. PLEA IN GENERAL AS WELL AS SELF FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE MAYBE A LOGIC TO? SUCH A SMOKE SO I THINK THAT THE SYSTEM MORE POP UP. UP PUBLIC. HEALTHY ISSUE AND THEN I THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP. A IN A GENERAL. A HOPEFUL DOT RIGHT SELF NON A SMOKER SIR SO. A. IT IS SO OF THE AREA. PERSONALIZED. A. THE ISSUE OF THE SMOKE WAS IN NON SMOKERS. UP BUT DOT IN ANY COMMUNITY ARE YOU MAY RUN INTO A SIMILAR ISSUE SIR BUT THE IN THE CITY OF IRVINE. A WE DEBATED THIS SO A LOTTA AND THE. COMPANIES. MOSTLY IRVINE COMPANY OWNS A MAJORITY OF THE. COMMERCIAL LAND RATHER THAN. BATTING THE SMOKING. AND THE SCHOOL WAS SO. WE CHOSE TO CITY OF IRVINE AYE TO COLLABORATE WITH YEAR BILL AT THE BUILDING OWNERS IN THE SHOPPING AT THE OWNERS.

NOT QUITE HUNDRED PERCENT I SEE SECRET BUT SIR IN THE IN IN THE PARKS EVEN THOUGH WE PREVENTED IN THE PARKS. IS SMOKING IS A BAND. BUT THE THEY'RE ARE SOME IN A BAD THAT PERSISTENCE DRIVE TO VIOLATE THE. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS OUR TOP PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ARE BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT DISTRIBUTORS. NATURE. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. MISTER HARPER. I MAY HAVE MISSED HEARD IN YOUR INTRODUCTION ON. I'M HELPING TO TRY TO CLARIFY. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO BILLS. THE BACKGROUND I HAVE IS THAT THIS BILL S. B. THREE. EIGHT I THIRTY FIVE IS INCLUSIVE OF THE STATE BILLS. THE FIRST ONE AND INCLUDES THE STATE BEACHES OR EXCLUDES THE STATE BEACHES LEAVING IT FOR THE SECOND ONE PLEASE CLEAR. THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR AT THIS MEASURE DEALS WITH STATE PARKS ONLY. THE NEXT MEASURE WILL DEAL WITH BEACHES. SO ART ART STATE BEACHES IN CLOSE HAVE A LOT IN MY DISTRICT HUNTINGTON STATE BEACH BALLS CHECK A STATEMENT WHICH. I IS WELL AS CRYSTAL CHO STATE BEACH ARE ALL UNDER THE STATE PARK SYSTEM I'D IS OUR AND IT IS THIS EXCLUSIVE OR INCLUSIVE OF THE BEACHES IN THE STATE PARKS. IN BOTH CASES WE GIVE AUTHORIZATION TO THE TO THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND REC. TO PROVIDE SMOKING AREAS TO DEAL WITH SIGNAGE SO THAT THE AUTHORITY ALL ULTIMATELY. AND HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED WILL BE WITH STATE PARKS. BECAUSE AS YOU INDICATE BEACHES ARE UNDER PARKS THEM ARE. THIS BILL THAT DEALS WITH THE SMOKING BAN ON STATE. I. PARKS. PARK LAND. CHINA IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND I LOOK FOR CLARIFICATION IF THERE IS ONE ITS EXCLUSIVE OF BEACHES. THAT'S WHY I. EIGHT THIRTY SIX DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH PEACHES NOW THERE'S A CLARIFICATION I'M I'M OPENED IT TO THAT WORK THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT IT. ON YOUR BEHALF IT MAYBE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT BETTER. YEAH I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK FOR FOR SOME ACCURACY HERE BECAUSE I'M I'M GETTING SOME CONFLICTING INFORMATION OF WHETHER IT'S INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE STATE BEACH. THE OTHER STAFF HAVE. WELL I THINK THE TERM TO THE STAFF HERE WHAT WE ARE STANDING IS THAT THE FIRST BILL INCLUDES EVERYTHING. THE SECOND THOSE SPECIFIC THE STATE THAT WHAT I HAD TO TO BEACHES EXCUSE ME THAT'S THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING HERE SO. THE HELP IT IS OBVIOUS HARPER YES. ANYONE ELSE. SEEN KNOWN WE HAVE A MOTION BY THIS. FRIEDMAN A SECOND FIGHT ME ON BEFORE I TOOK THE GAVEL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA. GALLAGHER. BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO CARILLO. CARILLO AYE CHOI AYE AYE CHOI AYE CHOI AYE CHU. CHIU AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE HARPER THOUGH HARPER NO. KALRA. KALRA AYE LEVINE. LEVINE AYE MATHIS NO MATHIS NO RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE SALAS WOULD I WOULD I. THREE. SO THAT MOTION PASSES MISTER GLAZER HARM. WE'LL LEAVE THAT UP OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON. PLEASE PER SE SECOND OF THANKS OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS BILL. BY ISRAEL IN RESPONSE THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE THAT THE CALLED OUT THAT BEACHES IN PARTICULAR AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE DIVIDED THE QUESTION SO THAT. THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE A CONCERN HER GREATER SUPPORT FOR THE ISSUE OF CPAS BEACHES AND SPECIFIC WOULD HAVE THAT CHANCE ON THIS BILL. FOR THAT ASTEROID BELT. VERY MUCH A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER HARPER. I'VE EXPRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES UP BEFORE AND NOT IN PREVIOUS BLLS. ON. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S TWO HARMS THAT ARE EXPRESSED HER TO AREAS TO SEE AGAINST THAT ARE EXPRESSED OF ONE IS THE LITTER SIDE. OF WHICH I YOU CAN MAKE CASE IN TERMS OF FILTERS OF CIGARETTES UP BUT IN TERMS OF CIGARS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FILTER ISSUE AND SO. I THAT I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT. I THINK MAY BE PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF DATA KIND OF AN ISSUE ALSO IN TERMS OF. VAPING PRODUCTS AND SUCH LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A AYE DOCUMENTATION OR SHOWING THAT THAT'S A CONTRIBUTOR ON A LETTER SITE PEOPLE SEEM TO WANT TO KEEP THEIR. PRODUCT IN TERMS OF. OF THOSE HAVE VAPING PRODUCTS SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ENSURE WHY DOES HER INCLUDE NAFTA SECONDHAND SMOKE SIDE. THE DIFFERENCE YOU HAVE VERSES MAYBE SOME INLAND PARK AREAS IS THAT SMOKING IS AT THE BEACH TYPICALLY IS VERY DISPERSED BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WEATHER AT THE BEACH THERE'S TYPICALLY EITHER AN OCEAN BREEZE. OR HEAVY OF. HEAVY OCEAN WINDS UP ONE OF THE OTHER VERY MUCH DISPERSES I ANY KIND OF A SMOKER SECONDHAND SMOKE SECTOR. I KNOW ONLY THAT BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM AT THE BEACH. IN WHICH A PEOPLE CAN NOW I GO TO AN AREA WHERE THERE IS SMOKING WHERE THERE'S NOT SMOKING EXCEPT FOR. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE ODD THAT THAT IS INDEED AVAILABLE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN. COEXIST ARE ON A BEACH BECAUSE THERECERTAINLY IS ROOM ESPECIALLY WITH THE A DISBURSEMENT SMOKE. I AND LASTLY I DON'T SEE THE HARM IN SOMEBODY SMOKING A CIGAR NEXT TO A BEACH BONFIRE RING. THE ISSUE IS SMOKE. SMOKE IS ALREADY THERE WITH THE UPBEAT BONFIRE AYE IN SO WHAT TO PROHIBIT. PEOPLE'S ENJOYMENT OF THAT I THINK IS. IT IS IT. PRETTY WERE. SO I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. THIS THIS ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I WOULD JUST COMMENT. THAT WE ARE IN OUR TOBACCO REGULATION OUR TOBACCO BILLS ON IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN. WE EXCEED BAXI DEFINE VAPING. WE'RE TREATING VAPING LIKE TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW THAT'S WHY THAT IS INCLUDED THERE. AND. HAVE SAYS SOMEONE HAS BEEN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE AGAINST A SMOKING AND WHO'S BEEN AROUND MY PARKS AND PICKED UP HUNDREDS OF CIGARETTE* PRIOR TO US BANNING SMOKING IN OUR PARKS. I TIE DO THEY DISAGREE THAT ON CIGARS ARE SOMEHOW LESS OFFENSIVE THEY'RE JUST BIGGER. AND NASTIER THINGS IN MY OPINION SITTING ON BEACHES AND% I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM GO AWAY AS WELL SO I'M FROM IN IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL ON MISTER GLAZER ADAM DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THAT MIGHT MAKE MY CLOSING COMMENTS WOULD BE THAT. OF COURSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT LETTER AS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT FORCE FIRES THAT COME AS RESULTS OF. SMOKING BUT THAT THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS IN THE AREA HEALTH EFFECTS OF SECONDHAND SMOKE. AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAWS AND. I EIGHT WE PROVIDE SOME ELEMENT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND REC TEAMS SET ASIDE DESIGNATED SMOKING AREAS AND. THEY WISH TO DO IT TO WEAR A BONFIRE IS BEING CONDUCTED THAT THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO. SMOKE THERE BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN ON OUR BEACHES AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU IF NOT ALL OF YOU HAVE. IRRESPECTIVE OF SOME BREEZES THAT MIGHT BE BLOWING THAT DAY. I THOUGHT THE SECOND AT HAND A IMPACTS OF SMOKING IS VERY PREVALENT. I AND I THINK THAT ALL OF US HAVE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE THAT IN WHICH IS WHY. THIS BILL IS SO VALUABLE TO OUR GOOD HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENRY WITHOUT ASTRONAUT VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GLAZIER WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS FRIEDMAN A SECOND BY MISS RUBIO MALWARE. CLUBS SORRY.
