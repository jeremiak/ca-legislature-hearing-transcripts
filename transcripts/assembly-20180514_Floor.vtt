02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.895
WHEN OUR STATE INTEL A COURT AS

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:52.765
AN OPPORTUNITY TO THROW IT OUT.

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:53.766
BUT THAT'S NOT MY ARGUMENT

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:55.901
THAT'S THE VERY ARGUMENT. BEHIND

02:02:55.968 --> 02:02:58.037
THE BILL BEFORE US.

02:02:58.104 --> 02:02:59.338
THAT A BILL WE PASSED JUST LAST

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:01.807
YEAR S. B. FIFTY IS NEGATIVELY

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:03.642
IMPACTING THE CONCORD REUSE

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:05.444
PROJECT IN FACT THE AUTHOR

02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:07.179
STATEMENT FOR TODAY'S BILL SAYS

02:03:07.246 --> 02:03:08.814
THIS IS JUST ONE OF NUMEROUS.

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.716
PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA QUOTE

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:12.885
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS NEW

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:15.421
STATE LAW S. B. FIFTY AND AS A

02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:17.757
REFRESHER WHAT S. B. FIFTY DID.

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:18.758
WAS REALLY.

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:20.459
SOMETHING QUITE REMARKABLE.

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:21.293
IT SAID WHEN THE FEDERAL

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.129
GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO

02:03:23.195 --> 02:03:24.663
TRANSFER LAND EITHER TO ANOTHER

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:27.099
ENTITY OR A PRIVATE PARTY.

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:28.868
THEN I AS THERE'S OFTEN GOOD

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.770
REASON TO DO AS IN THE EXAMPLE

02:03:30.836 --> 02:03:32.505
BROUGHT UP BY THE AUTHOR TODAY.

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:34.507
THEN WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.442
CAN INTERPOSE OURSELVES WE CAN

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:38.677
SAY NO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:40.513
WE CAN CALL THE DEAL OFF AND THE

02:03:40.579 --> 02:03:42.715
STATE CAN THEN GRABBED THE LAND

02:03:42.782 --> 02:03:44.550
FOR ITSELF. OR EVEN IT IF IT

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.818
DOESN'T IT CAN'T ACCORDING TO

02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.219
THE AUTHOR STEPHEN FOR TODAY'S

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:49.722
BILL IMPEDE THE TIMING. OF THE

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:51.724
TRANSFER.

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:52.658
NO EVEN WOULD S. B. FIFTY WAS

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:54.160
PASSED.

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:56.228
NO ONE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THIS IS

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:57.863
SOMETHING WE CAN ACTUALLY DO.

02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:59.799
UNDER THE US CONSTITUTION.

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:01.100
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY'S

02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:03.636
BELL BECAUSE SB FIFTY IS IN FACT

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:05.671
CURRENTLY BEING CHALLENGED IN

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:07.339
COURT AND TODAY'S BILL WOULD

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:09.475
ELIMINATE A BASIS FOR STANDING

02:04:09.542 --> 02:04:10.509
ON THE PART OF THE U. S.

02:04:10.576 --> 02:04:12.178
GOVERNMENT.

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:13.946
BUT WHY DO I SAY THAT NO ONE AT

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.614
THE TIME S. B. FIFTY WAS PASSED

02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:16.615
SERIOUSLY THOUGHT IT WAS

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:18.284
CONSTITUTIONAL.

02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:19.585
WELL FOR ONE THE ASSEMBLY

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:20.886
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S OWN

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:23.022
ANALYSIS SAID THERE'S A STRONG

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:24.623
POSSIBILITY THAT FEDERAL COURTS

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:25.891
WOULD FIND OF THIS BILL WOULD

02:04:25.958 --> 02:04:27.760
VIOLATE THE PROPERTY BECAUSE. OF

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:29.528
THE U. S. CONSTITUTION.

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.529
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:32.164
WHAT I WANT TO MOCK ARGUMENTS

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:35.167
MADE IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA THAT

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:37.703
THE BILL WAS CONSTITUTIONAL.

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:39.471
IN ADDITION IT TO VIOLATING THE

02:04:39.538 --> 02:04:41.073
PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE U. S.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:43.242
CONSTITUTION I THE ISSUE OF

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:45.077
FEDERAL PREEMPTION HAS ALSO BEEN

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:47.313
RAISED BY THE ONGOING LITIGATION

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:48.647
WITH RESPECT TO WHICH AGAIN

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:51.050
TODAY'S BILL WOULD ELIMINATE. A

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.885
BASIS FOR STANDING.

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:54.086
THEN WE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:55.721
PREEMPTION AUTHORITY ALONG WITH

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:57.323
SOME OBSCURE STATUTE OR

02:04:57.389 --> 02:04:59.058
REGULATION.

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.860
BUT THE FEDERAL LAW THAT S. B.

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:01.794
FIFTY VIOLATES IS A LITTLE

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.495
DIFFERENT.

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:04.897
IT'S A LAW PASSED BY CONGRESS IN

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:06.498
EIGHTEEN FIFTY.

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.300
AND OF THAT DATE SOUNDS FAMILIAR

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:10.169
THE TITLE OF THAT FEDERAL LAW

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:12.304
WAS AN ACT THROUGH THE ADMISSION

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:14.773
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTO

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.309
THE UNION.

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.411
THE ACT PROVIDED THAT SAID STATE

02:05:19.478 --> 02:05:21.013
OF CALIFORNIA IS ADMITTED INTO

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.748
THE UNION UPON THE EXPRESS

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.116
CONDITION THAT THE PEOPLE OF

02:05:24.183 --> 02:05:25.351
SAID STATE THROUGH THEIR

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:26.852
LEGISLATURE OR OTHERWISE SHALL

02:05:26.919 --> 02:05:29.255
NEVER INTERFERE WITH THE PRIMARY

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:30.556
DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC LANDS

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:31.757
WITHIN ITS LIMITS. AND SHALL

02:05:31.824 --> 02:05:33.759
PASS NO LAW AND YOU KNOW ACT

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.261
WHEREBY THE TITLE OF THE UNITED

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:37.129
STATES TO AND RIGHT TO DISPOSE

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:39.398
OF THE SAME SHALL BE IMPAIRED.

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:41.867
AND QUESTION.

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:43.002
THAT'S RIGHT LAST YEAR THIS

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:43.636
LEGISLATURE.

02:05:43.702 --> 02:05:45.437
PAST

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:47.840
A LAW THAT EXPRESSLY VIOLATES A

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.174
CONDITION OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:52.044
STATEHOOD.

02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:54.013
ON TODAY'S MEASURE I'M URGING

02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:57.082
MEMBERS TO WITHHOLD YOUR VOTE.

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.817
INTEL THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED

02:05:58.884 --> 02:05:59.985
TO EXEMPT FROM THE

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:02.254
UNCONSTITUTIONAL S. B. FIFTY NOT

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.689
JUST ONE TYPE OF TRANSFER. BUT

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:05.157
ALL TRANSFERS

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:07.293
FOR EXAMPLE ONE PROJECT THAT'S

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.594
BEEN HAMSTRUNG BY THE BILL IS

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.095
THE RESULT VITAL IS ASIAN OF THE

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:11.797
VA IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:12.464
ACRE.

02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:14.199
WEST LA CAMPUS

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:15.601
THAT PROJECT INVOLVES LEASING

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:17.369
PROPERTY TO PROVIDE PERMANENT

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:19.104
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND SERVICES

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:20.839
FOR LOCAL VETERANS AND ISSUING

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.675
AN EASEMENT TO LOS ANGELES IN

02:06:22.741 --> 02:06:24.276
ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PLAN PURPLE

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:27.479
LINE METRO PROJECT.

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.281
NOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.749
AFTER THIS BILL WE START GETTING

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.952
OTHER BELLS ASKING FOR FURTHER

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.720
EXEMPTIONS FROM SD FIFTY FOUR

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:36.789
OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS UNTIL S.

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.657
B. FIFTY IS FINALLY AND

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:40.859
INEVITABLY STRUCK DOWN BY THE

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:41.427
COURTS I THINK I'D BE A LOT

02:06:41.493 --> 02:06:43.996
EASIER. AND WOULD SPARE A LOT OF

02:06:44.063 --> 02:06:45.698
HARM TO A LOT OF PROJECTS

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:46.932
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IF WE

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.767
SIMPLY AMENDED THIS BILL TO TAKE

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:51.136
SB FIFTY OFF THE BOOKS NOW AND I

02:06:51.203 --> 02:06:52.738
HOPE THAT THE NEXT TIME WE'RE

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:53.572
TEMPTED TO PASS AN

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:55.040
UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW. WE

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:56.342
REMEMBER THIS THAT THAT IS A

02:06:56.408 --> 02:07:00.679

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.558
AND NOW JUST RECENTLY IN

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:08.593
SACRAMENTO.

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:09.995
THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:12.898
DENIED FUNDING NECESSARY.

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.733
TO FINANCE TEMPERANCE FLAT.

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:16.034
WHICH WOULD'VE BROUGHT WATER TO

02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.736
THE ENTIRE CENTER CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:16:17.802 --> 02:16:19.237
WE HAVE SITES RESERVOIR WE NEED

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:20.572
TO RAISE SHASTA DAM WE NEED TO

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:22.073
BUILD THOSE THE CARIS THERE'S

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.241
WATER PROJECTS UP AND DOWN THE

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:24.509
STATE THE STATE THAT THE STATE

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.511
WATER COMMISSION. DOES NOT WANT

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:27.846
TO BILL BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY DO

02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:30.181
NOT PENCIL OUT THE LAST THING WE

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:31.983
NEED IS MORE WATER MANDATES IN

02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:33.552
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:35.086
DO NEED IS TO COMPLETE THE

02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:36.488
CALIFORNIA STATE WATER PROJECT

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:37.522
WE NEED TO BUILD NEW WATER

02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:39.491
STORAGE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:41.359
CALIFORNIA SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS

02:16:41.426 --> 02:16:43.128
WE ACTUALLY STORE OUR WATER? AND

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:44.930
DON'T ALLOW FIFTY PERCENT OR

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:45.764
MORE OF OUR WATER EVERY SINGLE

02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:47.499
YEAR TO FLOW AND THE GOLDEN GATE

02:16:47.566 --> 02:16:49.668
BRIDGE INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:51.169
THIS BILL IS THE EXACT WRONG

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:53.939
APPROACH YET AGAIN BY SACRAMENTO

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:55.273
IT'S TELLING CALIFORNIA'S IT WE

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:57.475
LEAVE THAT WE LIVE IN A STATE OF

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.077
SCARCITY. WE DON'T LIVE IN A

02:16:59.144 --> 02:16:59.978
STATE OF SCARCITY LAYS

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.713
ADJOURNMENT WE LIVE IN A STATE

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:02.347
OF ABUNDANCE

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:03.949
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO USE OUR

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:05.216
TEXT FOR OUR TECHNOLOGICAL

02:17:05.283 --> 02:17:07.819
EXPERTISE. WE NEED TO BUILD NEW

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:08.820
WATER STORAGE UP AND DOWN THE

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.322
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:11.823
STORE MORE WATER.

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:13.124
NOT FIGURE OUT WAYS

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.693
HOW TO TAKE WATER.

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:16.561
SOME CALIFORNIANS

02:17:16.628 --> 02:17:18.029
IN EVER GREATER QUANTITIES WHICH

02:17:18.096 --> 02:17:19.097
EXACTLY THE STATE WATER

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:20.265
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WANTS TO

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:21.967
DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WANTS

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:24.035
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THE BROWN

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:25.770
ADMINISTRATION IS ONE TO DO NOW.

02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:27.539
GOING BACK DECADES WE'D TO BUILD

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.040
NEW WATER SOURCES OF CALIFORNIA

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:30.875
WE NEED FLOOD THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:32.677
WE'D ACTUALLY HAVE WATER STORAGE

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:33.745
OF CALIFORNIA'S GET GREEN LAWN

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.614
TO TAKE LONG SHOWERS THIS IS THE

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.315
EXACT WRONG APPROACH YET AGAIN

02:17:37.382 --> 02:17:38.850
FROM SACRAMENTO I URGE A NO VOTE

02:17:38.917 --> 02:17:40.385
ON THIS. LET'S BILL MORE WATER

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:42.921
STORAGE NOT IN POWER STATE WATER

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:43.421
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:45.523
CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS.

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.196
.

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:52.297
IT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:53.832
OF LEGISLATION EVERYBODY SHOULD

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:55.767
BE VERY FOCUSED ON BECAUSE IT'S

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.402
GONNA HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT.

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:58.169
ON EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT.

02:17:58.236 --> 02:18:00.238
.

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:02.273
IT IS GOING TO IMPACT YOUR WATER

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:04.242
RATES IN YOUR DISTRICT.

02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:05.510
IT'S GOING TO IMPACT HOW MUCH

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:06.511
CREDIT YOU GET FOR THE

02:18:06.578 --> 02:18:08.079
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'RE

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:09.147
COMMUNITIES HAVE MADE. AND

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:10.749
RECYCLING WATER AND OTHER

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:11.549
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:14.319
EXAMPLE.

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.087
INTO ME.

02:18:16.154 --> 02:18:17.689
WHAT'S SAD IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:18.957
STARTED THIS OUR.

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:20.759
WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:21.726
WE'RE BRINGING LOTS OF

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:23.428
STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. IN THE

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:24.829
LEGISLATURE THIS IS GONNA BE A

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:26.631
LEGISLATIVE.

02:18:26.698 --> 02:18:28.400
DRIVEN PROCESS.

02:18:28.466 --> 02:18:29.467
AND THAT PROCESS LARGELY BROKE

02:18:29.534 --> 02:18:31.503
DOWN.

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:33.238
WE HAD SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:35.206
BUT WE NEVER REALLY SAW. THE

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:36.241
AMENDMENT SAID A LOT OF US WERE

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:38.276
TALKING ABOUT.

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.278
NUMBER ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.613
SHOULD BE IN CONTROL THAT WE

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.114
SHOULD BE IN CONTROL TO MILLIE

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.416
OF HOW WE STEP HOW WE SET

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.017
STANDARDS THIS BILL STILL GIVES

02:18:46.084 --> 02:18:47.786
THAT POWER.

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:48.987
ULTIMATELY TO THE WATER BOARD TO

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:51.523
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:53.491
ANOTHER THING IN THIS.

02:18:53.558 --> 02:18:54.893
BILL DOESN'T DO AS IT DOESN'T

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.494
GET RID OF THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:18:56.561 --> 02:18:57.862
MODEL THIS STILL WOULD ALLOW

02:18:57.929 --> 02:18:59.831
THEM TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

02:18:59.898 --> 02:19:01.066
SET STANDARDS BASED ON THE WATER

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.434
BUDGET.

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.868
MODEL AND THERE'S LARGELY NOT A

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:06.538
LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND TO USE

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:08.273
OTHER METHODS OF BITTER IT LOOK

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:10.008
EVERY EVERYBODY KNOWS SIT IN

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:11.843
THIS ROOM THAT WATER NEEDS ARE

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:12.477
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:19:12.544 --> 02:19:13.812
THE STATE.

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:15.680
SOME AREAS HAVE MADE LARGE SCALE

02:19:15.747 --> 02:19:17.449
INVESTMENTS ARE RECYCLED WATER.

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:18.950
OTHERS OF US HAVE VERY STRONG

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.752
GROUND WATER TABLES AND AND WE

02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:22.487
HAVE BACKUP WATER SUPPLIES THAT

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:24.489
PUT US IN A STRONGER POSITION.

02:19:24.556 --> 02:19:26.691
SOME ARE REALLY FACING SOME

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:28.093
REAL DIRE STRAITS WITH REGARD TO

02:19:28.159 --> 02:19:29.527
GROUND WATER.

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:30.395
AND THEN THEY NEED ADDITIONAL

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.263
WATER SUPPLIES.

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:34.432
IT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY PART OF

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:36.501
THE STATE AND YET THIS BILL

02:19:36.568 --> 02:19:38.336
DOESN'T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:39.637
AND IT'S GONNA LARGELY GIVE ONE

02:19:39.704 --> 02:19:40.972
AGENCY OR WHOLE LOT OF A POWER

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:42.073
TO SET.

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:44.075
AN ARBITRARY.

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:45.977
STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY AND THE

02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:47.679
AND THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA HAVE

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:48.279
VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO CHANGE

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:49.781
THAT.

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:50.949
SO WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.417
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:54.419
RECYCLED WATER YES THERE IS IN

02:19:54.486 --> 02:19:55.920
HERE AN INCENTIVE.

02:19:55.987 --> 02:19:57.922
THAT ALLOWS FOR FIFTEEN PERCENT

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:59.657
FOR EXISTING FACILITIES.

02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:00.992
AND TEN PERCENT FOR NEW

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:02.093
FACILITIES THAT SHOULD BE

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.328
CONCERNING FOR ABOUT IN HERE IF

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:04.996
WE REALLY BELIEVE.

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:08.032
IN EXPANDING MORE RECYCLED WATER

02:20:08.099 --> 02:20:09.267
FACILITIES WIRE WE CREATED A

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.269
DISINCENTIVE.

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:12.237
YOU GET FIFTEEN IF YOU'VE GOT AN

02:20:12.303 --> 02:20:14.038
EXISTING BUT IF YOU CREATE A NEW

02:20:14.105 --> 02:20:14.839
ONE YOU GET LESS.

02:20:14.906 --> 02:20:16.941
CREDIT.

02:20:17.008 --> 02:20:19.277
TO ME THAT'S SORT OF BACKWARDS.

02:20:19.344 --> 02:20:22.380
.

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:22.947
YOU'LL FINALLY I THINK THAT.

02:20:23.014 --> 02:20:25.416
.

02:20:25.483 --> 02:20:25.984
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE THINKING

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:26.518
ABOUT.

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:29.621
.

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:31.489
WHY OR WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:32.857
GIVE OKAY OUR AUTHORITY AND THE

02:20:32.924 --> 02:20:33.992
I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE BIG

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:35.160
THE BIGGEST THING HERE WHY DO WE

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:37.095
CONTINUE? THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WE

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:38.596
SHOULD BE DRIVING THAT PROCESS

02:20:38.663 --> 02:20:40.131
IT'S OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:40.999
WHO ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE

02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:42.634
IMPACTED.

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:45.436
BY A VERY BROAD REACHING POLICY.

02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:47.172
IT SO WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:48.673
WE ACTUALLY LET'S TAKE THIS BACK

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:49.808
TO THE DRAWING BOARD LET'S

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:51.009
CONTINUE TO WORK ON A THERE'S

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:52.644
BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.045
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO HAD.

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:55.380
INFLUENCE ON IT BUT TO ME WHAT

02:20:55.446 --> 02:20:56.848
THIS FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW IS

02:20:56.915 --> 02:20:58.550
THAT WE'RE REALLY AFRAID OF A

02:20:58.616 --> 02:21:00.318
BUDGET TRAILER BILL COMING SO

02:21:00.385 --> 02:21:00.952
WE'LL JUST TAKE WHATEVER WE CAN

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:02.220
GET.

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:03.488
AND MOVE FORWARD AND SOME ARE

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:04.956
HAPPY BECAUSE THEY GOT A FEW

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.658
THINGS THEY'RE ASKING FOR. BUT

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:08.993
LARGELY THIS IS STILL VERY

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.795
FLAWED. POLICY.

02:21:10.862 --> 02:21:11.796
THAT YOU'RE QUITE DO YOUR

02:21:11.863 --> 02:21:13.364
CONSTITUENTS WILL BE ASKING YOU

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:15.300
ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS WHEN YOU'RE

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:17.468
WATER RATES START GOING UP.

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:18.469
AND THEY'RE SAYING WHY IS THIS

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:19.771
HAPPENING IN WELL BECAUSE WE

02:21:19.838 --> 02:21:20.805
HAPPEN TO COMPLY WITH S. B. SIX
