TAKE THIS PARA QUE HANDS ITEM THIS IS FILE ITEM TWENTY ONE FILE ITEM TWENTY ONE SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY SEVEN. COOKERY SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR WIENER AND OTHERS NOT HAVING THE CRIMES THIS PACKAGE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WIENER'S REPRESENTS SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY SEVEN WHICH REPEALS PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THAT CRIMINALIZED LOITERING WITH THE INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK. THE LEGISLATION ALSO PERMITS THE SEALING OF RECORDS FOR ANYONE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF THIS BOY DURING OFFENSE AND PROVIDES RESENTENCING FOR ANYONE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED FOR THE OFFENSE. SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THIS MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT PUBLIC% SAFETY AND UNSURPRISINGLY WE SEE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING BLACK AND BROWN TRANSGENDER WOMEN. DUE TO THE BROAD NATURE OF THE OFFENSE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS LICENSE TO PROFILE PEOPLE AND STOP THEM PRINT HURRIEDLY DISCRIMINATORY REASONS SUCH AS WEARING REVEALING CLOTHING WHILE TALKING TO PEOPLE IN AREA WHERE SEX WORK HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST. REVITALIZING PEOPLE FROM LOITERING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE MISTRUST THAT WE DISCUSS OFTEN BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TARGETED COMMUNITIES. THIS IS DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT DESTROYS THE RELATIONSHIP. AND MEANS PEOPLE WILL NOT ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY NEED IT. THE LOITERING OFFENSE IN FACT CREATES UNSAFE ENVIRONMENTS WHERE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION CAN OCCUR. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I HAVE DONE WORK TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND BELIEVE DEEPLY THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ON THIS FOR TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND TO HOLD TRAFFICKERS ACCOUNTABLE. THIS LOITERING LAW IS NOT THE WAY TO DO THAT. CRIMINALIZING THE VICTIMS AND LEAVING THEM WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS THE CREATE FURTHER BARRIERS TO SEEKING EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND RELIEF IS NOT THE ANSWER. LEADING TRAUMA INFORMED AN ANTI TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COALITION TO ABOLISH SEX TRAFFICKING OR CAST. ASIAN PACIFIC- ISLANDER LEGAL OUT REGION JUSTICE AT LAST I UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS ARE HARMED. BY THIS LOITERING LAW WHICH IS WHY THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN INNER DRIVE VOTE TODAY. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL DECRIMINALIZE SOLICIT TATIAN OR ENGAGING IN PROSTITUTION OR SEX WORK. UNDER THE BILL'S SEX WORK REMAINS ILLEGAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN CONTINUE TO APPREHEND THOSE ENGAGED IN THAT ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN CONTINUE APPROACHING MAKE CONTACT WITH PEOPLE THEY BELIEVE ARE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING TO OFFER THEIR HELP. SEX TRAFFICKING SOLICITATION AND PROSTITUTION AGAIN WILL REMAIN ILLEGAL SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN SIMPLY ELIMINATES ANY ENTRY WATERING OFFENSE THE RESULT IN THE LEGAL HARASSMENT OF LGBTQ PLUS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. FOR SIMPLY EXISTING AND LOOKING LIKE A SEX WORKER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MISTER K. HIM MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIVE SEVEN. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN OFFENSES THAT THE- THAT- DON'T ALLOW BETTER TO AMBIGUOUS TO ALLOW FOR ABUSE. AS ARE CALLING FOR MARANDA JUST STATED. WE HAVE THE TOOLS IN THE PENAL CODE. TO CONTINUE TO PROSECUTE FOR SOLICITATION FOR. THE ACT OF PROSTITUTION NOTHING IN THIS BILL UNDERMINES THAT THIS SIMPLY ELIMINATES. THIS VAGUE PROVISION IN THE PENAL CODE THAT ALLOWS FOR ABUSES FOR PEOPLE THAT. MAY SIMPLY BE PROFILED FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND FOR THAT RATE REASON- I RISE IN SUPPORT AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT SB THREE FIVE SEVEN. MISS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIVE SEVEN. AND ONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS POLICY SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS LEADING ANTI TRAFFICKING SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND LGBTQ ORGANIZATIONS. THESE PROSECUTORS SERVICE PROVIDERS AN LGBTQ LGBTQ GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE RELYING ON BOTH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE RESEARCH UNDERSTAND THAT CRIMINALIZING SEX WORK AND THOSE BEING TRAFFICKED. FOR LOITERING DOES NOT HELP THOSE IN NEED. INSTEAD THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS OFFENSE IS INCREDIBLY HARMFUL TO WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. WHO ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED BY THESE POLICIES AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ARRESTING SOMEONE ARE THREATENING TO ARREST THEM. AS MEANS TO HELP THEM IS NOT A TRAUMA INFORMED OR RECOMMENDED WAY THE LEADING- ANTI TRAFFICKING SERVICES SERVICERS RECOMMEND. AND ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CAST THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND HAD MENTIONED AND JUST AS THE LAST DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IS A WAY TO HELP. THOSE THAT ARE SEX TRAFFICKED CAST IS THE LARGEST HUMAN. TRAFFICKING GROUP- IN THE ENTIRE NATION AND A SERVICING ARRESTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSOF PEOPLE FROM SEX TRAFFICKING THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL. HELP NOT HARM THOSE BEING SEX TRAFFICKED WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM WE SHOULD LISTEN TO OUR FORMER PROSECUTORS HERE MY COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. I THINK MANY OF US WOULD DESCRIBE HIM AS SORT OF A LAW AND ORDER DEMOCRAT IN THE FACT THAT HE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THIS BILL AND THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR. HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TO CREATE SMART PUBLIC POLICY THAT HELPS WOMEN HELPS OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AS WICKS MR KALRA. URANUS THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER WHO DID REPRESENT ALL THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING THAT RECORD UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- AND YOU KNOW SOME OF SAID THAT. POLICE WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP OR OR APPROACH PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED WHO WHO OR WHO ARE SELLING SEX BY CHOICE OF THIS BILL IS PASSED. AND THAT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN HELP PEOPLE WITHOUT THREATENING TO ARREST THEM IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY FRANKLY SHOULD HAPPEN MORE OFTEN AND THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO HELPING WITHOUT FEAR AND INTIMIDATION THE ONLY TOOL YOU GIVE SOMEONE A HAMMER THAT EVERY PROBLEM LOOKS LIKE A NAIL SUMMARILY. THE ONLY TOOL WE GIVE GIVE IS OF ONE OF OUR REST THE ARREST IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT LEADS TO SO MANY OTHER ISSUES AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER COLLEAGUES AS WELL. THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO HELP THIS POPULATION DO NOT INVOLVE ARREST FOR EXAMPLE ANTI TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS ALREADY DO A REACHES SEX WORKERS AND THOSE BEING TRAFFICKED OF THEIR APPROACH OF OFFERING A HELPING HAND A MEAL A COUNSELOR AND ESPECIALLY A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND TRAUMA INFORMED EVEN EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF HOTEL EMPLOYEES IN TRANSIT EMPLOYEES. ARE TRAINED TO WATCH OUT FOR PERSONS BEING TRAFFICKED AND INTERVENE APPROPRIATELY THIS IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A REST WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT SEE SOMEONE IN DANGER OR DISTRESS THEY CAN OFFER TO HELP THEY CAN INTERVENE OR THEY CAN SUMMON SOCIAL SERVICES OR COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS WHO CAN HELP. US FOR MINORS POLICE RETAIN THE POWER TO ASSIST ANY MINOR DANGER OR TO DETAIN THEM UNTIL SOCIAL SERVICESARRIVE SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO HELP OR APPROACH PEOPLE CONVICTION RECORDS ARE NOT HELPING THREATEN PEOPLE WITH THE TRAUMA OF ARREST AND INCARCERATION IS NOT HELPING. VOTING FOR THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL THAT IS WHY SPONSORED BY TRANSIT TRANS BEING A COALITION STRANGER JAMES INFIRMARY. AND OTHER GROUPS LIKE THIS IS MY COLLEAGUES MY COLLEAGUE IN THE TO AN- EXPLOITATIVE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I BY. THANK YOU KALRA VALID YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RESPECTFULLY AND I TO THIS BILL MEMBERS I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING OR MODERN DAY SLAVERY NEEDS TO BE ELIMINATED IT HAS NO PLACE IN A MODERN NATION IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT IT STILL EXISTS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THREE OF THE TOP OF THE TOP TEN CITIES. MOST KNOWN FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO. ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WORK HARD TO HELP IDENTIFY AND RESCUE VICTIMS OF THIS HORRIFIC PRACTICE AND ARREST THOSE WHO TRAFFIC THESE VICTIMS. SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN WILL UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING AND BRING SEX TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE. BUT IF I HAD TO ARREST AND HAD TO INTERVENE AND GIRLS TRAFFICKED AT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE. AND IT'S A CYCLE OF ABUSE AND BEING ABLE TO SEPARATE THAT SOME OF THESE GIRLS LITTLE GIRLS IS VITAL AND ENDING THE CYCLE OF ABUSE THAT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THIS BILL IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THAT. WE NEED TO BE GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE TOOLS TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING NOT LAST. WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THIS BODY AND HELPING. WOMEN AND GIRLS THAT ARE BEING TRAFFICKED THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON BILLS AND POLICY THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER THIS DOES NOT DO THAT IN FACT IT'S GOING TO ENDANGER MORE LIVES. OF GIRLS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I STRONGLY URGE FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. MEMBERS IF YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE DEBATE PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. MR SAY ARE TELL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THIS DOES NOT MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER FOR ONE WHO HAS WORKED A LONG TIME IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED WITH THIS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS NOT VERY HARD. TO SEE WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE ARE HANGING OUT ON THE CORNERS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE APPROACH. POLICE ARE TRYING TO REMOVE THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY FROM COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE FAMILIES THAT LIVE THERE. DO NOT WANT TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS OR HAVE THEIR KIDS SUBJECTED TO HAVING TO WALK THROUGH THESE AREAS ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER FAMILY IN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY. SO THIS ALSO TAKES ANOTHER TOOL AWAY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO HELP DEAL WITH THIS. THE SEX TRAFFICKING ISSUE HAS BEEN CLEARLY- TALKED ABOUT BY SEVERAL MEMBERS IN HERE AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CLARITA. AND THEN IT IS THAT'S TRUE THE POLICE HAVE VERY FEW TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE SOMEBODY OUT. OF THE SYSTEM TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEY DO WANT HELP OR NOT. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT HELP THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN JAIL THEY GET RELEASED WE DON'T EVEN PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL THAT STILL NINE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT JAILING PROSTITUTES ANYMORE. SO THERE ARE THERE IS A PLETHORA REASONS FOR NOT DOING THIS BUT THE PRIMARY ONE IS IT DOES NOT MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER. IT DOES NOT. SO WE NEED TO STOP THIS THIS TREND OF TAKING AWAY THE TOOLS THAT ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS NEED TO CLEAN UP OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT WE CAN ACTUALLY WE CAN HELP THESE PEOPLE IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THEM. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THIS ARE NOT BEING HARASSED. I DID NOT SEE ANY OF THAT IN THE CITIES THAT I WORKED IN AND BELIEVE ME. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE WORKING OR SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT THOSE FOLKS WANT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE I'VE HEARD ALL WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WANT. YOU KNOW WHAT BALONEY. I WORKED WITH THOSE PEOPLE I WENT TO THERE. ARE YOU KNOW I HELP THOSE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME THEY WANT THE SAME THING EVERYBODY WHAT ELSE ONCE THEY WANT A SAFE CLEAN COMMUNITY. AND THEY NEED HELP DOING THAT AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HELPING THEM TO THE OFFICERS.SO WE NEED TO STOP TAKING TOOLS AWAY. AND DIED IN THIS THIS BILL JUST DOES THAT. SO YOU KNOW I OF I URGE YOU TO VOTE OF VOTE NO ON THIS. AND I CONTINUE TO ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES. TO BE SAFER COMMUNITIES AND ALLOW POLICE OFFICERS TO DO THEIR JOBS THANK YOU. MR LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS NINE I MEAN NOT TO- INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE BUT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO JUST READ TO YOU AND REMIND YOU SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT'S SELF EXPLANATORY WITHOUT OBJECTION. THANK YOU. BAY AREA ANTI TRAFFICKING COALITION. BEACONS FOR VICTIMS. CAPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE CHILD AND ADULT SEX TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA FREED COLLECTIVE. NATIONAL CENTER ON SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. RESTORATION RANCH A WOMEN'S SHELTER. AND THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL JUST TO NAME A FEW I THINK THOSE ARE VERY SELF EXPLANATORY THAT OF THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMMITTED THEIR LIVES TO TRY TO PROTECT. THESEVICTIMS WERE IN THE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CIRCUMSTANCE. MY SEATMATE KNIVES VISITED AN AREA IT'S A BRAND NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THEIR LIVES TO A REHABILITATING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THE CYCLE OF ABUSE AND IT'S REPREHENSIBLE AND THEY REMINDED US OF THE DANGERS AND THEIR CONCERNS FOR THIS BILL AND ITS PASSAGE SO PLEASE PLEASE. LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO ARE TRAPPED OR HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS VERY UGLY CYCLE THEY DESERVE BETTER THANK YOU.% AND MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES- WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH BEING MORE INSIDE OF LAW AND ORDER AND THAT'S SOME OF THE SPACE THAT I AM VERY PROUD OF AS WELL. BERMAN THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. SIMPLY BEING TARGETED FOR THE CRIMINALIZATION OF POTENTIALLY SOLICITING OR THE APPEARANCE OF SO. THAT'S IN WHICH THERE'S BEEN ABUSES IN THIS PENAL CODE. AND WE THINK ABOUT THE LEGISLATION AT HAND PRINCIPALLY IT'S TAKING A SURGICAL APPROACH AT RECTIFYING THE INJUSTICES SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS TRANS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND WE THINK ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY I ASKED YOU FOR EMPATHY AND SAYING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS ON ITS BOOKS ALL. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECTIFY THE INJUSTICES SO AGAIN AS A PROUD MEMBER OF OUR LGBT COMMUNITY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR EMPATHY AT TAKING A LOOK AT THIS. BILL AS IT SURGICALLY RECTIFY THE INJUSTICE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LOW MEMBERS IF YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE DEBATE FRAZIER MICROPHONES RIGHT NOW PLEASE. MISTER COOPER YOUR RECORD LAST THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS COMES A MISDEMEANOR THE SAME IS A BROKEN WINDOW OR DO A LOT ON JOB IMPACTS MUCH MORE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS. TO TALK ABOUT AFTER LAW HUMAN TRAFFICKING REFERENCES ON THIS A LOT OF JUVENILES ARE USED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE KNOW THAT LOVE ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE SO THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE HERE PASSED THE BILL A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE YOU CANNOT DETAIN A JUVENILE SUSPECTED HUMAN. BEING INVOLVED IN PROSTITUTION WE'VE BEEN THAT SO YOU CAN'T STOP SOMEBODY FOR THAT YOU ALSO CAN INTERVIEW A MINOR. SO HOW DO YOU RESCUE A MINOR. AS BEING HUMAN TRAFFICKED. IF YOU CAN'T DETAIN THEM. THAT WAS PASSED HERE YOU CAN'T INTERVIEW THEM THAT WAS PASSED HERE TO SAY THE FROM THE PEP. SO LONG AS YOUNG GIRL BEFORE BEFORE YOU EVEN HEARD THE TERM HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A LOT OF BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS EVER BEING VICTIMIZED BY GANGS CRIMINAL STREET GANGS AND OUT YOU KNOW IN THE YEAR SINCE THIS TOOK OFF IN THE TRAFFICKING TAKEN A BIG THING THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S REAL TALK I DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THIS FIGHT BUT- I SEE IT OUT THERE ARRESTED PEOPLE FOR THIS. AND WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING OUT TO YOU SEE THAT A LOT OF TIME IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. MAYBE THERE'S SOME DISCRIMINATION CASES I'M NOT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T BUT FOR THE MOST PART YOU'RE OUT THERE DRIVING AROUND YOU KNOW. WHO'S OUT THERE WORKING WHO'S NOT WORKING THE SPECIAL THEIR RISK OF CERTAIN AREAS THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT IS BUT- THE PART ABOUT IT IS THOSE YOUNG GIRLS OUT THERE. LIKE I SAID. WHAT DO WE DO THAT DO WE DEAL WITH THAT. I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO. JUST TO CRIMINALIZE PROSTITUTION. THEY MAKE A SIMPLE AND SIMPLE IS REALLY WANT TO DO THAT THIS IS WHAT IS DONE YOU TALK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLBOX. IF SOMEONE CAN HERE CAN TELL ME RIGHT NOW. IF YOU'LL MINOR THAT IS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE USE MATTERS A LOT. HOW DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT TACKLE THAT. BECAUSE THE WAY THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN IN THE LAWS OF IMPASSE THERE THERE REALLY IS NO WAY TO TACKLE AND DEAL WITH IT. I'M I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU. I BUILT A SENIOR PERSONALLY WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. SOME OF YOU ANOTHER DAY FOR THE OTHER THE VAN OUT THERE DOING ID THE DOCUMENT TRAFFICKING. DURING COVERT IS BLOWN UP HUMAN TRAFFICKING- CHILDREN BEING ABUSED ON THE INTERNET INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN. YOU KNOW THAT THEY GET FORTY SIX IN OUR CASE THE YEAR HERE IN SACRAMENTO THEY GET TIPS ON THEY CAN'T RESPOND ALL THOSE TIPS. AND LOVABLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO. I SCRATCH MY HEAD IS HOW DO WE DEAL WITH IT YEAH SOUNDS GOOD PEOPLE SHOULD BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BUT NOT IN ALL CASES THE LAW CASES. WRITTEN A CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE THAT GOT A PERSONAL CONDOMS AND STUFF. IT'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THAT THAT YOU DO WITH IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND YOU KNOW WHO THE PLAYERS ARE WHO THEY ARE LIKE I SAID IF WE REALLY WANT TO HELP MINERS YOU TALK ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT'S IT IT BY THE WAY IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW TODAY PRISON DAY. HUMAN TRAFFICKING OF MINOR TO PEOPLE KID. IS NOT CONSIDERED A VIOLENT FELONIES FEW PICK A KID GUESS WHAT. BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. YOU GET RELEASED EARLY FROM PRISON. WHICH IS ALSO LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MONEY GOES THAT WE WILL WE'RE ALWAYS BANKING ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BANG ON THAT. LET'S NOT JUST TALK THE TALK LET'S WALK THE WALK AND HELP. A LITTLE BILLS LIKE I SAID YOU CAN'T INTERVIEW MINOR. YOU CAN'T ATTAIN A MINOR FOR PROSTITUTION LOT OF MINOR SO YOU CAN LOOK. THEY GIVE THE FINGERS WALKOFF THEY'VE BEEN TOLD BY THEIR PARENTS. WE CAN'T TALK TO YOU. DON'T TALK THE COPTIC NOR THE COPS. THEY TELL THEM THAT'S WAS BETTER OFF YOU'RE BETTER OFF HAVING MINORS BECAUSE YOU CAN DETAIN ADULT MUCH SIMPLER. THE NEW CANAAN WHINER SO- THIS BILL IS THE COOKED A WHILE WELL INTENTIONED IT'S A LONG WAYS TO GO SOURCE IF WE ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS. MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS OUT. I RISE UP ASKING YOU TO. THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. AND I WANT TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS- WITH THE- MY FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO AREA AND HIS EXPERIENCE BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE DO IN FRESNO. WE HAVE A ROBUST. CONNECTION WITH MANY SEX TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. THAT HAVE SAFE HOUSES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IT IS TOOLS LIKE THIS. THAT ALLOW OUR POLICE. TO SEPARATE. THE VICTIM ON THE STREET. WITH THE PAMPHLETS DOWN THE BLOCK AND AROUND THE CORNER. AND WHEN WE SEPARATE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL. THEY'RE GOING TO A SAFE HOUSE. THEY'RE GOING TO A PLACE THAT CARES FOR THEM. M. THOSE RESCUES. ARE SO OFTEN TIMES FACILITATED. BECAUSE THERE ARE. ASSESSES AND LAWS. THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM. BUT ALSO SEPARATE THEM FROM THE PAMP. AND UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THIS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AS I HAVE BEEN OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY THESE TOOLS MATTER. IT IS A PROTECTION. FOR CUSTODY. KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM THE PIMP THAT'S GOING TO BEAT HIM UP SCARED TO DEATH. HURT THEM. THAT SEPARATION TAKES PLACE. AND THEN THEY ARE HELPED. THESE ARE THE KIND OF TOOLS. AND THEY'RE BEING EFFECTIVELY USED. TO RESCUE THE VICTIMS. WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THOSE KINDS OF TOOLS. NOT BECAUSE WE'RE TARGETING. WE'RE PROTECTING. THAT'S HOW WE USE IT IT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO REMAIN BECAUSE IT'S EFFECTIVE IN SAVING. CARING FOR AND TRANSPORTING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO SAFE HOUSES AND PLACES WHERE THEY CAN GET HELP. DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER I WAS NOT PLANNING ON RISING I'M TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT JUST. LISTENING TO THE DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS- THERE IS A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE BEING SECTION SEX TRAFFICKED NOT JUST IN THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT JUST FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS IT FALLS ON OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE MANY OF THESE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL SYSTEM INVOLVED IN AS IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. WHEN THEY COME INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR TREATMENT AND SCREENING AND WHEN WE FIND OUT THAT THEY HAVE EITHER INFECTION OR PREGNANCY AND THERE'S A LOT OF. THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. BUT THIS BILL REALLY TALKS ABOUT PROFILING. AND WE'VE ALREADY SAID HERE ON THIS FLOOR THAT WE DON'T AGREE WITH RACIAL PROFILING. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY A GANG ENHANCEMENT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROOF. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL BASICALLY SPACES YOU CAN'T ARREST SOMEBODY FOR HOW THEY LOOK. WHERE THEY'RE WALKING. OR WHO THEY MAY LOVE. YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY CATCH THEM IN THAT ACT. AND SO IT'S NOT A BILL THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW. PREDATORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR YOUTH. AND LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY WE DO NEED TO DO BETTER. BUT THIS BILL. IS ABOUT PROFILING AND WE'VE ALREADY STATED ON THIS FLOOR THAT THIS IS NOT A STATE. THAT IS GOING TO PROFILE SOMEBODY. BASED ON THEIR RACE. THEIR GENDER THEIR SEX. AND THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. TECH DATA WEBER. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M I TWO HAD NOT INTENDED TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL TODAY BUT SEVEN I FEEL COMPELLED TO STAND AT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT I AND MY INABILITY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING TO MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND MANY PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT. I'M HERE'S THE THING WE OFTEN VOTE ON VERY WELL INTENTIONED TO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT HAVE AN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE ALWAYS NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND FOR ME WHEN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROTECT. VICTIMS OF CHILD TRAFFICKING. EVEN IF THAT'S JUST A POSSIBILITY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN SUPPORT AND TIME SO REGRETTABLY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS THIS BILL TODAY. MEMBERS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BAIT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. MISTER PRIME YOUR YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I WILL BE EXCEPTIONALLY BRIEF. THERE WAS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WE PUT THIS LAW ON THE BOOKS. THE LAW I BELIEVE WAS RIGHTEOUSLY INTENDED TO HELP CURB HUMAN TRAFFICKING THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY ZERO DATA OR EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IT HAS WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CITED ON THE FLOOR. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT OCCURRED. IS THAT BLACK WOMEN. IN TRANS WOMEN HAVE BEEN PROFILED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT RESULTING IN OVER SIXTY PERCENT. OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PICKED UP FOR THE START BEING BLACK WHEN. BEING THIS ABORTION THE TRANSFER THAT'S THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WE MADE A MISTAKE. AND WE NEED TO ROLL IT BACK. THIS DOESN'T PREVENT. US FROM GOING AFTER TRUCKERS IT DOESN'T PREVENT US FROM GOING UP TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SOLICITING. STATION WE CAN STILL DO THAT WORK WHAT WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT THE PROFILING THAT THE CARD FROM THIS LAW. I ENCOURAGE NOVEL. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME. THANK YOU MEMBERS MS PARA QUE HAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD ON THIS BILL BUT I ALSO WANT TO CLEAR A COUPLE THINGS THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS WERE SAID THAT ARE. PATENTLY FALSE ONE OF WHICH WAS THE FOCUS ON CHILD TRAFFICKING AS MY COLLEAGUE MEL GROVE ACTUALLY POINTED OUT THAT WAS DECRIMINALIZE THE LOITERING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION FOR MINORS WITH DECRIMINALIZED IN SB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE BILL CARRIED BY. SENATOR MITCHELL THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM DOES IN FACT A CO AUTHOR ON SO IF YOU BELIEVE THIS IS THAT LOITERING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION IS A TOOL NEEDED TO END CHILD TRAFFICKING WELL YOU SHOULD TALK TO WHOEVER THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BECAUSE THAT WAS DONE IN THIS BILL RELATES TO PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SO I TRY TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT ABOUT WHAT THE LAW DOES TODAY AND WHAT THIS LAW WILL CHANGE BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF MISSTATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT WERE MADE IN THESE DEBATES. SECONDLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO CALLED THIS A TOOL USE THE WORD TOOL MANY TIMES IT'S A REALLY NICE WORD FOR CRIMINALIZING VICTIMS IT IS NOT JUST A TOOL MEMBERS THIS IS A CRIME. AND I WANT US TO CALL IT WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. SO IF YOU BELIEVE. THAT FULL HER LAWYER DURING SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. THEN DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO BUT IT'S NOT A TOOL IT'S A CRIME AND THESE PEOPLE END UP WITH A RECORD THAT WILL STOP THEM FROM GETTING HOUSING AND JOBS IN THE FUTURE THEY DESERVE. AND SO I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS IS. AS A BODY WE PASSED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN AID FOR VICTIMS. SO WHICH GOES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WE- AS A BODY BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE BELIEVE DEEPLY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE SPOKE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DISCUSS DOING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE ALL WANT TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SAYS WE'RE LOSING THE WAR ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT CAST LA WHICH IS THE STRONGEST ADVOCATE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO WHEN THE QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT. WHAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHICH COMMUNITIES DO CARE ABOUT. AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IS NOT SAFER WITH THIS LAW ON THE BOOKS AND IS A LONG TIME ALLY. AND LGBTQ PLUS RIGHT I AM PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. AND LASTLY. WHEN ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE SAID. WELL IF THEY'RE DRESSED THAT WAY. HOW MANY OF US HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN RATE WHO WERE TOLD WELL. YOU WERE DRESSED THAT WAY BEING DRESSED THAT WAY IS NOT A CRIME. AND IT WILL NEVER BE OKAY TO BE VICTIMIZED BECAUSE YOUR DRAFTS IN ANY MANNER. I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY WHO'S WATCHING AND LISTENING TODAY. AND WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR LGBTQ PLUS SISTERS AND BROTHERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR ED. THE CLUB THE ROLE. THE DESIRE TO GO TO A MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE.

WILL MOVE THE FILE ITEM THIRTY SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE TRIPLE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE BY CENTER BACK HER BACK LOOKING TO MURDER SOME OF OUR CAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS BODY PASSED SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY SENATOR SKINNER. THE BILL CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S LONG HELD AN UNJUST FELONY MURDER LAW WHICH WAS IN OUR CAKE MEASURE THAT ENABLE PEOPLE WHO NEVER KILLED ANYONE NOT EVEN ABOUT A MURDER AND NEVER EVER EVEN INTENDED FOR DEATH TO OCCUR TO NONETHELESS BE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER COMMITTED BY SOMEBODY ELSE. AND WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE. THE MEASURE WE CREATE A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO TOOK PLEA DEALS TO LESSER CHARGES. SUCH AS MANSLAUGHTER APPLY FOR RESENTENCING. IT WAS A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT TRANSFORMED OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE LONG MARCH TOWARDS FAIRNESS. JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. HOWEVER SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SOME COURTS HAVE INCORRECTLY LIMITED ITS APPLICABILITY. ONLY TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF MURDER BUT NOT LESS CULPABLE OFFENSES LIKE ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER. IN PRACTICE THAT HAS LED TO THE UNFAIR SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING IF THE VICTIM DIED. BUT OUR INELIGIBLE IF THE VICTIM DID NOT DIE. SB SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE OF THE NARROW LIMITED MEASURE TO CLOSE THE UNREST LOOPHOLE. IT DOES SO BY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW TO INCLUDE VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTIONS AS ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE ALSO ALLOWS FOR COUNSEL TO BE APPOINTED IN PETITIONS FOR RESENTENCING. AND ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR ALL THOSE WHOSE MURDER ATTEMPTED MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTIONS ARE FINAL TO APPEAL. THE REFORM WOULD ASSIST HUNDREDS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT THE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE DEEMED TO BE EXCLUDED BY TECHNICAL LANGUAGE OF FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. THE BILL WAS AMENDED IN THIS HOUSE OF THE QUEST OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHOSE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND ENJOYS THE SUPPORT OF NUMEROUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMER INNOVATIONS. THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. BIGAMIST ARCANE SEEING. THE DEADLINE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO POINT OUT AS YOU DELIBERATE THIS BILL SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY TECHNICAL INNOCUOUS EXTENSION OF A LAW BUT IT GOES A LOT DEEPER THAN THAT. FOR ONE THING IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND MOST PEOPLE. A MAJORITY I WOULD SAY- THAT ARE CONVICTED OF VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER DONE SO AFTER PLEA AGREEMENT THEY'RE CHARGED WITH MURDER AND THE EVIDENCE IS SHAKY MAYBE ON THE MURDER OR MAYBE THERE ARE YOUNG OR MAYBE THERE ARE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR MAYBE. THEY DON'THAVE A RECORD AND THE DA'S OFFICE OFFERS THEM A PLEA BARGAIN WHERE THEY PLEA TO VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE PENALTIES ON THESE TWO CRIMES ARE MUCH DIFFERENT. MURDER ONCE TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE MURDER TO FIFTEEN TO LIFE. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IT'S THREE SIX OR ELEVEN YEARS SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THAT BE PRETTY ENTICING TO A DEFENDANT FACING THE POTENTIAL FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE TO TAKE THAT DEAL SO THEY TAKE THAT DEAL AND THAT'S THE DEAL THEY MADE WITH THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED THE PEOPLE. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW WE'RE COMING ALONG AND SAYING. WELL YOU GET TO READ BE RESENTENCED WELL OKAY. BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT THE JUDGE HAS TO LOOK AT EVIDENCE AND IT EXCLUDES HEARSAY EVIDENCE PUT ON A PRELIM. PRELIMS ARE ALL DONE WITH YOUR SENTENCE. PLEA DEALS DON'T EVEN SOMETIMES HAVE PRELIMS. SO YOU'VE GOT NO RECORD THERE'S NOTHING TO LOOK AT FOR THESE RESENTENCING. WHICH MEANS THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BE RUBBER STAMPED BY THE COURTS. SO PEOPLE THAT WERE CHARGED ORIGINALLY WITH MURDER GOOD CHUNK OF THEM. THAT TOOK A DEAL THAT THEY MADE WITH THE STATE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. GET A SEVERE REDUCTION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EVIDENCE. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM TURNS JUSTICE. BECAUSE JUSTICE HAS DIFFERENT SIDES THERE'S JUSTICE FOR THE ACCUSED THERE'S DUE PROCESS FOR THE ACCUSER JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS AND THE VICTIMS FAMILY TO. THE LAW HAS ALWAYS TREATED ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MURDER SERIOUSLY ALWAYS. FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF PRE RECORDED HISTORY AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF RECORDED HISTORY. MANKIND KILLED EACH OTHER INTENTIONALLY. READ SOME HISTORY IT'S PRETTY UGLY. THAT'S WHY EVERY CIVILIZED SOCIETY SAYS MURDER IS GOING TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT IS A CRIME FOR WHICH YOU CANNOT UNDO THE HARM. NO NOT A COUNSELING FIXES MURDER. NO MATTER REHABILITATION FIXES A LIFE THAT YOU SNUFFED OUT. AN INNOCENT LIFE THAT YOU TOOK WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. THE CHANGES FAMILIES. WRECKS LIVES THAT'S WHY THE LAW HAS ALWAYS SAID MURDER IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERYTHING ELSE BUT GUESS WHAT. THE PENALTY FOR MURDER IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTEEN TO LIFE DEPENDING ON THE TYPE THE PENALTY FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. WHICH HAS THE SAME CONDUCT AND THE SAME INTENT THE ONLY DIFFERENCES THE VICTIM GOT LUCKY AND SURVIVED. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT'S A FACT IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT LEARN CRIMINAL LAW. THE PENALTY FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. IS FIVE SEVEN OR NINE YEARS. THIS BRINGS UP A CASE I WORKED ON WHEN I WAS A DA WAS THE LEAD ATTORNEY BUT I WROTE BRIEFS IT WAS UNDER THE NATURAL PROBLEM CONSEQUENCES MURDER DOCTORAL TRY TO BE FAST BECAUSE I'M UNDER A TIME LIMIT. DEFENDANT LET'S CALL MISTER J. MISTER JAY WAS THIRTY YEAR OLD HOW LONG RECORD HE CONVINCED THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD WILL CALL HIM MR EIGHT HE COMMITS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD BARELY ABOVE A KID. TO GO RIP OFF A HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE DEALING WEED A LITTLE SLEEPY BEACH TOWNS IN THIS BESPOKE COUNTY MISTER J. GAVE MR A THE A- HAND GUN. HE SAID GO IN THERE. TAKE THEIR MONEY TAKE THEIR DRUGS. MR A WIN IN THEIR IT'S ALL MASTERMINDED BY MISTER J. THE OLDER GUY SITTING IN HIS CAR RIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. OUR WAY TO GET A KID TO DO THAT. MR A WIN IN I NEED THE GUN AT THE DRUG DEALER. BASICALLY JUST SELLING WEED NOT EVEN A LEGAL NOW SHOULDN'T BE AYE BUT FOR THAT. WHEN THE GUN ADAM SAID GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM. THE WE DEALER HAD TWENTY TWO UNDER THE BED. AND HE GRABBED THE TWENTY TWO TO DEFEND HIMSELF MR A SHOT MISSED. AND THE WE DEALER SHOT BACK TO DEFEND HIMSELF HIT THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD IN THE RIB. THE BULLET PUNCTURED THE LONG NINETY YEAR OLD DOT. CAN'T PROSECUTE HIM. HE'S HE'S IN MANY WAYS A VICTIM. WE PROSECUTED MR J. THE MASTERMIND THE GUY WHO SET THIS ON THE MOTION WHO CREATED THE CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH A NINETEEN YEAR OLD WAS MURDERED. WAS KILLED CAN'T PROSECUTE THE KID DEFENDING HIMSELF. YOU GOT EVERY RIGHT UNDER LAW TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST. DEADLY FORCE USING DEADLY FORCE THIRTY SECONDS. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF SITUATIONS THAT THIS TYPE OF STUFF APPLIES TO. SO KNOW THAT pMISTER A BEEN A LITTLE LUCKIER HAD THAT TWENTY TWO ROUND. GONNA MILLIMETER TO ONE DIRECTION IT WOULD HAVE GLANCED OFF HIS RIB ANY BE ALIVE TODAY. MISTER J. WOULD'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. AND HE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. TO BE RESENTENCED AND LET OUT EARLY WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM ANY VICTIM. OR ANY EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE IS PROBABLY GONNA. THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS WISH TO DISCUSS OF A BABY ITEM IS MARKING YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO FOR HIS REMARKS I JUST WANNA MAKE A CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO THIS BILL IS ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE CHARGED AND CONVICTED UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN AIDING AND ABETTING MURDER WHICH WILL STILL REMAIN ON THE BOOKS AFTER THIS BILL PASSES THIS IS PEOPLE WHO DO NOT INTEND FOR MURDER TO OCCUR AND THEY ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF ANOTHER WELL WE'RE YOU YOU I WAS NOT HERE AT THE TIME BUT THIS HOUSE RT SAID THAT THEY CANNOT BE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER COMMITTED BY ANOTHER. BUT IF IT IS A MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE THEY CAN STILLBE CHARGED EVEN IF THEY DROVE UP THINKING ALL THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN WAS SOME CRIME MUCH LESS. THEN WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE INCIDENT AND NOW THEY'RE BEING CHARGED THE CRIME OF ANOTHER. AND I THINK WHAT. THE QUESTION THAT IS BEFORE THIS HOUSE TODAY AND WAS BEFORE THIS HOUSE. WHEN SENATOR SKINNER BROUGHT HER BILL YEARS AGO WAS. WHERE SHOULD THE CULPABILITY LIFE. THE PERSON WHO PULLS THE TRIGGER COMMITTED MURDER COMMITTED MANSLAUGHTER WHATEVER THE CRIME IS THAT WAS COMMITTED. AND THEY WILL SERVE THE TIME IF ENABLE PROSECUTOR. PROVES GUILT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT BUT- ARE YOU GUILTY FOR THAT ACT IF YOU WERE NOT THE ONE WHO COMMITTED IT. AND IF THAT ACTS RIGHT NOW IS MANSLAUGHTER LOSSES YES. AND I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE THE HOUSE AND I BELIEVE THAT MANY OF US BELIEVE JUSTICE IS SERVED WITH THE PERSON WHO COMMITS THE ACT IS CHARGING SERVES THE TIME. AND WE EACH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS THAT WE SHOULD SERVE THE TIME AND I GET AWAY DRIVER WILL SERVE TIME FOR CRIME BUT NOT THE CRIME COMMITTED BY ANOTHER. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS JUSTICE MEAN AND EVERY VICTIM DESERVES JUSTICE. AND THE PERSON WHO PULLED THAT TRIGGER WILL SERVE. FOR THAT CRIME WHICH HAD SOMEONE ELSE WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU TO PURPLE OPEN. ALL MEMBERS OF THE DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE.

ARTHUR CHARLES CHARLES DEVINE WAS BORN IN LOS ANGELES. HE GRADUATED FROM UC BERKELEY WITH ABOUT A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING AND RECEIVED A MASTER OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HE WAS A STATE LICENSE CIVIL STRUCTURAL AND FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEER AND DURING HIS THIRTY SIX YEAR CAREER WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING AND SAFETY. HE HELD VARIOUS POSITIONS INCLUDING CHIEF OF EARTHQUAKE SAFETY DIVISION CHIEF INSPECTOR BUREAU AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER. DURING THIS TIME HE MET AND MARRIED PAULA THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE AND THEY SHARED A- REALLY BEAUTIFUL LIFE TOGETHER A LIFE THAT. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH MANY MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. SINCE HIS RETIREMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ART VOLUNTEERED IN NUMEROUS PLACES. WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY PEOPLE THAT WHEN THERE'S A BOARD OF A NONPROFIT YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON IT. WHEN THERE'S A BIG IMPORTANT FUNDRAISER FOR GOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT THE HEAD OF IT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WILL OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALWAYS OPEN THEIR HOME. TO INVITE IN COMMUNITY GROUPS TO HOLD FUND RAISERS THEY'LL BE THE PERSON THAT'S COOKING THE FOOD OR STANDING IN LINE. ART WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HE HAD A LOVE OF ANIMALS AND HE VOLUNTEERED AT THE WHITE WILDLIFE WAY STATION. HE VOLUNTEERED AS AN ARBITRATOR FOR THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SERVED AS AN OMBUDSMAN AT CBS TELEVISION ENTERED THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS UNITED WAY CAMPAIGN. HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE GLENDALE FIRE FOUNDATION AS WELL AS THE GLENDALE POLICE FOUNDATION WHERE HE RECEIVED THE FIRST VOLUNTEER OF THE WORD OF THE YEAR AWARD FOR HIS SERVICES. HE CONTINUED TO SERVE THE GLENDALE COMMUNITY ON VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN HE WASN'T INVOLVED AS A BOARD OR COMMISSIONER. HE SERVED ON THE GLENDALE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS THE CONDO BUILDING AND FIRE BOARD OF APPEALS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION. ON WHICH HE SERVED FOR TWELVE YEARS. I MET HIM BECAUSE WHEN I WAS SERVING ON THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD OR MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT IN GLENDALE. HE TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING AND IT WAS REALLY A MENTOR FOR ME AND ALWAYS TALK TO ME AND MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE ABOUT HOW THE CITY WORKED. AT ABOUT POLICY. ANY PUSH ME TO RUN FOR GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. AND BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE PAULA LITERALLY AT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. AT SOMEONE'S HOUSE AND LICKED ENVELOPES FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS I THINK THEY MAY HAVE ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE SPONGE THINGS. BUT THEY DID THAT. THAT PHYSICAL WORK AND SWEAT EQUITY. TO HELP SUPPORT ME- IN IN MY GOALS- AND ALWAYS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR OUR CITY. ARTS SAID THAT HIS VOLUNTEER WORK. TOOK SO MUCH OF HIS TIME BECAUSE IF HE QUOTED. HIS IS A QUOTE FROM HIM THERE'S NOTHING MORE REWARDING AND GRATIFYING THAT KNOWING YOU'RE HELPING PEOPLE AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE BY GIVING YOUR TIME AND RESOURCES. WITHOUT WANTING EXPECTING OR RECEIVING ANYTHING IN RETURN. AND THIS WAS A PERSON WHO NEVER SOUGHT OUT ACCOLADES. YOU NEVER SAW HIM SAY WELL MAYBE I SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN FACT HE WAS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE BEING THE ONE. GIVING THE RECOGNITIONS.

ART WAS ALSO SOMEONE WHO WAS INCREDIBLY WARM AND GENEROUS. HE NEVER HAD A BAD WORD TO SAY ABOUT ANYBODY EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ACTING BADLY. HE JUST IGNORE THAT AND FOCUS ON WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS GOOD. HE WAS THE EPITOME OF POSITIVITY. AND HE HAD A GLOW IN A LIGHT ABOUT HIM THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. ART ALONGSIDE HIS PARTNER PAULA WAS A FIXTURE IN THE GLENDALE COMMUNITY AND WE ARE STILL IN SHOCK THAT HE HAS LEFT US SO SOON. THEY DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE. EVERYBODY KNOWS OF THE THING HE CARED ABOUT MOST IN THE WORLD WITH HIS WIFE PAULA. HE WAS HIS ROCK HE SUPPORTED HER THROUGH ALL OF HER OWN VOLUNTEER EFFORTS. AS WELL AS HER SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN TO SERVE ON THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL WHERE SHE NOW SERVES THE COMMUNITY AS OUR MAYOR.

MEMBERS WILL BE MOVING TO FILE ITEM SIXTEEN THIS IS SB SIXTY THREE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL SIXTY THREE BY CENTER STERN AND OTHERS NATALIE THE FIRE PREVENTION A SUMMER FRIEDMAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS EXCELLENT BILL. SB SIXTY THREE IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR'S SB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD NOT RECEIVE A VOTE ON THE FINAL THE RECESSION THE NEED FOR THIS BILL CONTINUES TO RISE. AS THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON HIGHLIGHTED CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG PATH TO FORCE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FIRE RESILIENCY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REDUCING RISK FOR HOMES AND STRUCTURES AND PROTECTING OUR NATURAL LANDS. THIS BILL TAKES SEVERAL STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION BY ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITIES FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND COMMUNITY HARDENING WHILE ALSO ENHANCING BUILDING STANDARDS IN THE AREAS OF THE HIGHEST BUYER WRIST IN THE STATE. SB SIXTY THREE WILL MOBILIZE MORE PEOPLE IN THE EFFORT TO BRING DOWN CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RISK BY EMPOWERING LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN VOLUNTEERS IN FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS. COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FIRE PROTECTION GRANTS TO HELP WITH THE FESTIVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ASSESSMENTS FOR RESIDENTS AND TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING AND CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THEIR STRUCTURES. THE GRANTS WILL ALSO EXPANDED FENCIBLE SPACE TO INCLUDE ROADWAYS AND DRIVEWAYS TO ALLOW FOR BETTER INGRESS EGRESS AND ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES AN EVACUATION. THIS BILL ALSO APPLIES FIRE SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS BE ON THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES IN THE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREA TO ALSO INCLUDE THE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOON WITH AN OPTION TO EXTEND THEM INTO THE MODERATE FIRE HAZARDSEVERITY ZONES WHERE APPROPRIATE. NOT ONLY IS THIS THE SAFEST OPTION THIS IS A GOOD FINANCIAL DECISION FOR COMMUNITIES A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HEADWATERS ECONOMICS REPORT FOUND NEGLIGIBLE COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A TYPICAL HOME AND HOME CONSTRUCTED USING WILD FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS AND DESIGN FEATURES. HOWEVER AS WE ALL NO. THE DIFFERENCE THE SAVING THOSE FEW PENNIES WOULD MAKE SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOUSE STANDING OR NOT STANDING. THE COST OF A LOT OF LETTER OF COURSE IS ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER. DECADES OF RESEARCH AND POST FIRE ASSESSMENT TO PROVIDE A CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT BUILDING MATERIALS AND DESIGN. COUPLED WITH LANDSCAPING ON THE PROPERTY OR SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS. INFLUENCING WHETHER IT'S STRUCTURE SURVIVES OF WILDFIRE OR IS LOST. SB SIXTY THREE HAS THE SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS OF CALIFORNIA AND MORE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN THE SEVEN MEMBER COOLEY RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE IMPORTANCE AND TIMELINESS OF THIS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SENATOR DARRELL STEINBERG. AUTHORED SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES BILL. WHICH REQUIRE ALL COUNTIES THE STATE TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THEY PROJECTED GROWTH IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE PLAN ENVISIONS GROWTH OUT IN THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. EIGHT MY DISTRICT ALONG THE JACKSON HIGHWAY HEADED TOWARDS AMADOR. COUNTY THIS IS ACTUALLY A GREAT OPEN AREA WHERE GROWTH. WILL BE COMPACT THAT THAT'S SORT OF THE VISION AND THEN IT'S AN ERROR THIS LIMITED BY NUMBER RIVERS A RUN THROUGH THEIR- BY A LACK OF DEVELOPED AREAS. TO VERY CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR EXAMPLE JACKSON HIGHWAY HAS A HUGE BOTTLENECK JUSTICE OF A LARGE- KNOWS RANCHO MURIETA. SOLD THE POINT IS ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE GALVANIZED TO COUNTIES TO ENVISION THEIR GROWTH PATTERNS AND THOSE AREAS MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE IDEAL FROM A FIRE EGRESS EMERGENCY EGRESS STANDPOINTS WILL BILL LIKE THIS. IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE IT WILL HELP COUNTIES COMMUNITIES DEAL WITH A FIRE RISK NOT JUST NOW BUT AS THEY GROW UNDER SMETHING LIKE THE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE CLIMATE. SUSTAINABLE COMMITTEES PLAN SO I THINK IT IS A VERY TIMELY MEASURE I FEEL A DOUBLE TAILS WITH IMPORTANT ISSUES. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME AND I BELIEVE WILL HELP COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE EIGHT DAY D. DEAL WITH THEIR FIRE RISKS HIGHER JULY VOTE. THANK YOU MR COOLEY. SEEING NO MEMBERS WISHING TO FURTHER DISCUSS ARE TO BE THIS ITEM NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM MR FRIEDMAN THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE CALL NUMBER OF. FIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF THE DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WE DESIRE TO VOTE. WE'LL CLOSE THE ROLLING CALENDAR I SIXTY ONE NO ZERO THE BILL IS PASSED. NEXT WE'LL MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN THIS IS SB NINETY EIGHT CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL NINETY EIGHT BY SENATE MCGUIRE AND OTHERS MAGNITUDE OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE SELLER MAKES YOUR RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT SB NINETY EIGHT THE FREEDOM OF PRESS ACT ON BEHALF OF CENTER MCGUIRE AND IS A CO AUTHOR. FRIEDMAN PRESS IS ONE OF THE MOST- FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENTS OF OUR DEMOCRACY IT'S WHAT IN MANY PLACES SETS US ASIDE AS A COUNTRY. WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS FREEDOM IT HELPS TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS IT ALSO KEEPS PEOPLE LIKE US AND CHECK KEEP THEIR GOVERNMENT IN CHECK INTO SOME OF THE STUFF LIKE THAT SOMETIMES BUT- I VALUE THAT I KNOW ALL OF YOU VALUE THAT. AND IT HELPS ULTIMATELY STRENGTHEN OUR DEMOCRACY. HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE SOME CRACKS. WITHIN THIS FRIEDMAN SB NINETY EIGHT WILL HELP STRENGTHEN AMERICAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO KNOW. LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY'RE OVER SIX HUNDRED INCIDENCES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY MANY OF WHICH WERE IN CALIFORNIA OF PRESS BEING DETAINED OR INJURED WHILE COVERING OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. MEMBERS OF THE PRESS RISK THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY EACH TIME THEY ATTEND A PROTEST RALLY TO GET THE PUBLIC THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. AND DESERVE. CALIFORNIA MOSTLY THE WAY TO ENSURE THE RIGHT OF THE PRESS RIGHT OF THE PRESS AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARE PROTECTED. AND HELD TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD. CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW REPORTERS ARE GRANTED AUTHORITY TO ENTER AREAS CLOSE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE FIRES FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES. IN ORDER TO GATHER THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO RELATE TO THE PUBLIC. THEY CAN ALSO GO OUT DURING CURFEWS AT TIMES OF NATIONAL DISASTERS. THESE PROTECTIONS HOWEVER DO NOT EXPRESSLY EXTEND A FIRST AMENDMENT DEMONSTRATIONS SUCH AS MARCHES RALLIES AND PROTESTS. SB NINETY EIGHT EXTENDS CRUCIAL PROTECTIONS TO MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AS THEY ENTER IN REPORT ON EVENTS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. ADDITIONALLY SB NINETY EIGHT ALLOWS REPORTERS THE CHANCE TO CHALLENGE THEIR DETAINMENT OR LACK OF ACCESS BY WORKING WITH MANAGEMENT ON THE SCENE. THIS LANGUAGE PROVIDES THE NECESSARY SAFETY NET TO REPORTERS WHO WERE NOT GRANTED ACCESS INTENSELY DETAINED OR MISTAKENLY DETAINED. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. THAT I'M SURE SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD WITH REGARD TO COMMAND POSTS. THERE'S NO EXPECTATION TODAY IN STATE LAW WHEN A MEMBER OF THE PRESS OR MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WALKS INTO A POLICE STATION. THAT THEY WOULD BE GIVEN UNFETTERED ACCESS OF COURSE THEY WOULD NOT. THIS BILL MIRRORS THE SAME ACCESS THAT EXIST IN STATE LAW FOR NATURAL DISASTERS. MEMBERS OF pUNFETTERED ACCESS TO A MOBILE COMMAND POST UNITS UNDER THIS BILL. THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN SEVERAL MOMENTS TO MAKE THIS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. SB NINETY EIGHT REPRESENTS A MULTI YEAR EFFORT AND THE AUTHOR HAS MADE MANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS YEAR'S BILL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL IS A MUCH MORE REFINED AND WORKABLE VERSION OF ANOTHER BILL WHICH PASSED THIS HOUSE LAST YEAR. SB NINETY EIGHT WILL ENSURE THE JOURNALISTS ABILITY TO PERFORM THEIR CRITICAL ROLE OF DOCUMENTING HISTORY INFORMING THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTED. AS THEY ATTEND THESE DEMONSTRATIONS MARCHES PROTESTS AND RALLIES. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION. ETHNIC MEDIA SERVICES. THE REPORTER COMMITTEE AND THE ACLU AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WICKS. SCENE NO MEMBERS WISHING TO DISCUSS OR DEBATE THE ITEM THE PARK WILL OPEN ALL THOSE THOSE WHO DESIRE TO GO. ALL THOSE WHO DESIRE TO MOVE. ALL THOSE THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. HARPAL CLOSER ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTES IS FORTY TWO NUMBER SIXTEEN. THE BILL IS PASSED. WE WILL MOVE AHEAD TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO THIS IS SB THREE EIGHTY CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL THREE EIGHTY BY CENTER EGGMAN AND OTHERS NATALIE TO END OF LIFE DECEMBER WOULD YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER REMEMBER TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP THREE EIGHTY A BILL THAT MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE END OF LIFE ACTION OPTION ACT. WHICH HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO DYING PATIENTS SINCE JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. SENATOR EGGMAN HELD TWO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THE ACT AND THROUGH THOSE HEARINGS WHICH INCLUDED PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. HOSPITALS PROVIDERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. A. B. CLAIM CLEAR THAT SOME WELL INTENTIONED ASPECTS OF THE LAW SERVE AS BARRIERS FOR TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS WHO SEEK AID IN DYING. SB THREE EIGHTY MAKES THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. A KAISER PERMANENTE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVICE SURVEY REVEALS THAT ONE THIRD OF TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS DIED BEFORE COMPLETING THECURRENT TIME CONSUMING PROCESS. THIS BILL REDUCES THE MANDATORY FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN TWO OR WITH QUEST FOR AID IN DYING MEDICATION TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FINAL ATTESTATION. THE FORMER BE GIVEN TO THE PATIENT BY THEIR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPLETE IT WITHIN THE FORTY EIGHT HOURS PRIOR TO SELF ADMINISTERING AND ADMINISTERING THE AID IN TRYING TO FIND MEDICATIONS. TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS WHO ARE NEARING DEATH HAVE ALREADY BEEN EVALUATED BY TWO PHYSICIANS ABOUT THEIR MENTAL CAPACITY TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS. PLACE TWO ORAL REQUESTS AND ONE WRITTEN REQUEST WHICH IS WITNESSED BY TWO INDIVIDUALS. THIS FOURTH REQUEST WAS REDUNDANT. THE BILL EXTENDS THIS THE SUNSET TO JANUARY TWELFTH AT WORK FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY ONE. DATA COLLECTED UNDER THE LAW- BY CDPH TELLS US THAT MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED A PRESCRIPTION FOR AID IN DYING MEDICATION SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. OF THOSE MORE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DIED FROM INGESTING THE MEDICATIONS. MEMBERS THAT MEANS THAT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WERE GIVEN A MEASURE OF SERENITY AND CONTROL OVER THE TIME AND MANNER OF THEIR IMMINENT DEATH. THE CORPORATE TAX PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THE LAW HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED CASES OR INSTANCES OF ABUSE OR COERCION. IT'S TIME TO REMOVE UNWARRANTED BARRIERS TO ACCESS AID IN DYING SO THAT ALL ELIGIBLE TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN AUTONOMOUS. AND DIE WITH THE DIGNITY IN THE MANNER THEY DESIRE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBM. THANK YOU MR ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE EIGHTY IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR THIS BILL PROVIDES TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS AN OPTION AT THE END OF LIFE SHE DIED PEACEFULLY AND WITHOUT SUFFERING. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT IN THE LIFE OPTION ACT INTELLECT OF OPTIONS OF IN THEIR LIVES THE REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL PERSONALLY ABOUT THE CONCEPT WHY WOULD YOU VOTE PREVENT OTHERS FROM MAINTAIN THIS COMPASSIONATE OPTION. THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T FIT WITHIN YOUR MORAL CODE. DON'T USE IT. I THINK JERRY BRON MY TO PUT PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SIGNED THE ORIGINAL BILL IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN.

THANK YOU SPEAKER IN MEMBERS SBSEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS WITH ONLINE SALES TOTALING MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR REPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF JACKSON FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION THE CITY OR CITY ARE COUNTY OF THE PURCHASES FOR ALL TAXABLE SALES TRANSACTIONS ONLINE. ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE TAX REVENUES THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS DIRECT REVENUES TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. CORPORATIONS USE THIS IN. AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WHERE LO. RESULTS IS A PROCESS DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS SENDING ALL OF THEIR SALES TAX THEY COLLECT IN CALIFORNIA TO THAT SINGLE JURISDICTION. ALL FOR THESE REASONS SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS REPORT. THEIR DATA THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND NUMEROUS CITIES ACROSS THE STATE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR GLAZIER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR COR DECEMBER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE TWO. WHICH IS SIMPLY A TRANSPARENCY DATA COLLECTION MEASURE WHEN SOMEONE IN YOUR DISTRICT BUYS A PRODUCT AT A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE THE SALES TAX THEY PAY STAYS IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT WHEN THEY BUY THE SAME PRODUCT ONLINE THE TAX THEY PAY CAN GO TO A CITY HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. YET THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON THE EFFECT OF ONLINE SHOPPING AND LOSS OF REVENUE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED AS OUR COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMY CONTINUE TO REBOUND FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS AND AS MORE OF THE ECONOMY MOVES TO ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. WE NEED BETTER DATA TO BE ABLE TO SEE HOW THESE TAX SHIPS ARE IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE ONCE WE HAVE THE DATA WE CAN CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IF THE INFORMATION ONCE AND AGAIN IT'S A DATA SIMPLY OF TRANSPARENCY DATA COLLECTION MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN NINE TWO. THIS BILL UNDERMINES A POLICY THAT IS CREATED JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN VOLATILE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. SO ARE WE REALLY GOING TO RE DIRECT FUNDS TO WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES WHO DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. THAT WAREHOUSES BRING TO COMMUNITIES. ARE WE GONNA EXASPERATING THE INEQUALITY AMONG OUR UNDESERVED AND MORE PRIVILEGE COMMUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM VETOED A SIMILAR BILL WHICH WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THESE TAX INCENTIVES. IN HIS VETO MESSAGE GOVERNOR NEWSOM ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE TAX AGREEMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT LOCAL TOOL THAT CAPTURES ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND INLAND CALIFORNIA. I DID NOT SUPPORT THAT BILL. STEAD I AUTHORED A BILL THAT REQUIRED LOCAL AGENCIES TO INFORM THE PUBLIC BEFORE APPROVING- RANTING ANY ECONOMIC SUBSIDIES THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT BILL. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAREHOUSES. WITH INCREASED TRUCK TRAFFIC INCREASED AIR POLLUTION WITH THE- ATION OF ROADS CAUSED BY TRUCKS SO THE SHIFT WHERE THESE TAXES WOULD GO WOULD BE A GREAT OF MISTRUST IN JUSTICE SO I STAND AND ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB SEVEN NINETY TWO. THANK YOU MR MEDINA ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLING RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE TO THE GROWTH OF OUR ONLINE ECONOMY HAS LED TO A SHIFT IN SALES TAX REVENUE FROM SMALL RULES CITIES HAVE LOST BRICK AND MORTAR STORES TO PLACES WHERE ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD OFFICES AND WAREHOUSES. CITIES LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE CONNECTION TO ONLINE RETAILERS ARE ABLE TO SCOOP UP SALES TAX PAID BY RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN RURAL AREAS LIKE EIGHTY ONE. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WILL BE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT BUT WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT UNTIL WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS US WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HOW DIFFERENT POLICY CHOICES MIGHT AFFECT THE FLOW OF OUR SALES TAX REVENUE THIS BILL GATHERS DATA WHICH CAN HELP US ACCESS HOW WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT OUR REAL COMMUNITIES I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER ALI SON EVER MAYES ARE RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT- WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH STATE- IN THIS A NEW ENVIRONMENT TO ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WITH ALL THIS ONLINE SHOPPING THIS. THERE ARE CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN GAMING THE SYSTEM AT AND IT'S A POSITIVE IT'S A NET BENEFIT FOR THEM ESPECIALLY FOR CITIES THAT ARE- THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN A CITY THAT WAS IT WAS DISADVANTAGED BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT CITY THAT I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER OF IS ACTUALLY BEING HARMED BECAUSE THESE REVENUES ARE GOING TO OTHER PLACES AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE BENEFIT. OF THEM SO ONCE AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT DATA. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SB FIVE THIRTY ONE AND SB SEVEN. NINE TO THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. IS THAT SB SEVEN NINE TO ASSEMBLY DATA COLLECTION BILL. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CITY OF OCEANSIDE THEY WROTE ME AND WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE GAP. BETWEEN WHERE. SALES TAX IS GOING IN ORDER TO MODERNIZE OUR TAX LAWS. SO I WITHOUT URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER WARREN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN HERE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS MY COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY STATED WE NEED DATA. IF AS LAWMAKERS WE WANT TO DEVELOP GOOD POLICY. AS MORE THE ECONOMY MOVES TO ONLINE TRANSACTIONS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE HOW THE OUR ALLOCATION OF LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUES. AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITIES. BY STUDYING HOW ONLINE SALES ARE ACTUALLY ALLOCATED ACROSS THE STATE SB SEVEN NINE AT TWO. WOULD BETTER INFORM THE PUBLIC AND LEGISLATORS. AND LEAD TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS IN THE FLOW OF GOODS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS WOULD IN TURN ALLOW POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE REASONABLE. THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS AND SALES TAX POLICY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MS IRWIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST RECOGNIZED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AND I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE COLLECTING DATA BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA WE COLLECT. ACTUALLY REPRESENTS WHAT'S TRULY GOING ON WHERE A LOT OF THE- WAREHOUSES IN A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THE ROAD DESTRUCTION THAT'S GOING ON. THAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY GET COLLECT DATA ON EVERYTHING BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S AND PACKED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT HAVE SO MANY. WAREHOUSES THAT ARE THERE AT THE AIR POLLUTION SHOULD BE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE COLLECT ON. WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING. AT THE- TRANSPORTATION HUB AROUND THE AREAS WHERE THE WAREHOUSES. ARE SO IT'S NOT ABOUT. A AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT'S AGAINST MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA THAT'S BEING COLLECTED IS WELL THOUGHT THROUGH AND THE PREMISE FIRST GOES BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE BEING ASKED TO HAVE THESE WAREHOUSES THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING ASKED TO HAVE. THE TRANSPORTATION OF THESE DIESELS GOING THROUGH SIDE BY SIDE WITH FAMILIES IN CARS. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT DATA AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT VOICE IS ALSO PART OF THE EQUATION. BUT WE ALSO START TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE START TO LOOK AT COLLECTING DATA. THAT WE ALSO. IF NOW WE GET TO THAT POINT WHERE THE SALES TAX REVENUE IS COLLECTED BY THE END USER IN THAT JURISDICTION WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE THESE WAREHOUSES ARE AT. WOULD NOW GOING THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION TACKED ON ANOTHER IMPACT FEE TO. THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE CONDUCTING BUSINESS I'M ALL FOR COLLECTING DATA I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING. AND I THINK THIS BILL DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE THE VOICES OF THOSE THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED. I ASK THAT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED A QUIRKY MAKE CLOSE. SO TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO OBJECTED TO THE BILL I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD POINT IN THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO TAKE A LOOK AT AIR POLLUTION. UP THIS DATA WILL BE COMING TO THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE I AM ON IT- I WILL CERTAINLY ASK THE CHAIR- AUTUMN. IT'S ME. THE CHAIR OVER THERE ARE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE DATA AND NOT COS REVENUE GAIN. LET ME SAY. IF I COULD ONLY REMEMBER WHICH CITY IS THE CITY OF LA. WE SORRY. THE MEMBER FROM INGLEWOOD WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK AT ALL OF THAT- BEYOND THAT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE WAREHOUSE CITY GETS THE- THE- THE TAX ANYTHING THAT YOU GET FROM APPLE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE WAREHOUSE IS GOES TO THE CITY OF CUPERTINO. AND THEY HAVE MADE CONCESSIONS TO APPLE IN ORDER TO GET THAT PRIVILEGE. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING WE WILL SEE IF WE GET THAT DATA AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATE IS NOT GOING TO BE SO OBVIOUS BUT AGAIN IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE WAREHOUSES THAT GET IT. AND WE NEED TO SEE THAT AS WELL TOO SO I ASK THE ARRIVE OF. THANK YOU DR PEPPER WITH THAT WE'LL OPEN THE ROLE. PRIOR TO VOTE ALL THOSE VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL THOSE WHO WHO DESIRE TO VOTE.

MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT MY CONCERNS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS BILL. WHEN IT COMES TO RECRUITING PEACE OFFICERS WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE. WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE LIFE EXPERIENCE IN MY OPINION REMADE QUALIFICATIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER AS FOLLOWS FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO HAVE LITERATE APPLICANTS THAT'S DONE THROUGH THE WRITTEN PORTION OF THEIR APPLICATION SECONDLY. INTEGRITY WHICH IS DONE THROUGH THE BACKGROUND CHECK AND HOW TRUTHFULLY THE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS LASTLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT. AS A PREREQUISITE THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS HAVING A SERVANT'S HEART. WILLING TO GIVE THEIR OWN LIFE FOR THOSE THEY SERVE AND PROTECT. OUR PRIORITY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON APPROVING THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION PROCESS. ONE OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES I'VE HAD. WITH THIS THE CONVERSATION ALL YEAR LONG. ARE THE OMISSIONS OF ALLOWING HONORABLY DISCHARGED MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. AGAIN BECAUSE LIFE EXPERIENCES TO BE EMPHASIZED OVER CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE. ARE YOU TELLING ME A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY WHO CARRIED OUT THE EVACUATION MISSIONS OF IT IN AFGHANISTAN NEEDS TO SIT IN A CLASSROOM TO LEARN HOW TO SERVER NAVIGATE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. I ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU MISTER LACKING. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO DISCUSS THIS ITEM- SUMMER JONES SAWYER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I AND I THINK MY STEAM- VICE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY FOR HIS COMMENTS. I WANTED TO KNOW THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THAT AND THIS IN THE- THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE WE'RE- TRAINING WILL DEFINITELY INVOLVED. PORAC MAKING SURE THE POLICE CHIEFS ARE INVOLVED TO DO WE HAVE A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE PEOPLE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNICABLE IS. GREAT BOTH THE CLASSROOM AND REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION I AM DID NOT IGNORE WHEN YOU CAME TO ME EARLIER BACK IN JUNE. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND THAT WE ALSO GIVE THEM. A BONUS POINTS.

THANK YOU MR TANG MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR ARE WE CAN HALF AGO AND I HAVE NOT GOTTEN A CLARIFICATION. I HAVE A I HAVE A BILL THAT IS NOT A LAW THAT STATES THAT A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENSE- IF YOU HAVE ONE YOU CAN NEVER OWN A GUN IF A- PERPETRATOR FIVE WEIGHTS THAT OUT WAIT FOR THIS- I DON'T KNOW WE'RE CALLING IT EXPUNGED. MEANT THEN HOW DO WE KNOW OR HOW IS A GUN SHOP GOING TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN NEVER OWN A GUN. MISTER CHANG YOUR RECOGNIZE THAT THEY CAN SPEAK WITH A GREAT QUESTION. MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN IS THIS BILL DOESN'T IMPACT ANY PROTECTIVE RULES ISSUED BY THE CORPORATE MASSIVE VIOLENCE. MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A RESTRAINING ORDER IT MIGHT THE BILL THAT BECAME LAW. STATES THAT IF YOU HAVE A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU ARE BANNED FROM OWNING A GUN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROTECTIVE ORDERS IT SPECIFICALLY STATES. THAT YOU CANNOT OWN A GUN SO IF. A AND MY SISTER'S ABUSER IS SMART ENOUGH TO WAIT THAT OUT FOR THIS TO BE. EXPUNGED AND- POTENTIALLY CAN GO BUY A GUN BECAUSE NOW UNDER THIS. ROLE HIS MISDEMEANOR WOULD BE- TAKEN AWAY HOW. ARE WE GOING TO ASSURE THAT THAT LAW DOESN'T CONFLICT ITH WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY MISTER CHANG YOU MAY ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WISH.

AT LEAST FOUR YEARS FREE OF CRIMINAL CHARGES AND ALL SERIOUS BIO AND SEXUAL FELONIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS RELIEF. ADDITIONALLY THE AUTHORS INCLUDED SAFE CARS ARE A LOT OF COURT AND PROSECUTORS TO OBJECT TO ANY RELIEF GRANTED IN ORDER TO RETAIN FINAL DECISION. LAST ECONOMIC AS BRITTONIC BARRIERS TO HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. LEADING THE MULTI GENERATIONAL POVERTY. THESE BARRIERS WITHIN THE CYCLE OF POVERTY SEVERELY LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. TRAGICALLY PEOPLE SHORT ON ALL ALTERNATIVES. AND OFTEN CRUSHED UNDER COURT- DEBT FREE WE RETURNED TO JAIL OR PRISON. NEARLY 75% OF FORMING CLOSER INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED A YEAR AFTER RELEASED. THE EFFECTS OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT VERY BY RACE. AND AFTERMARKETS ARE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS A SMARTER MORE COMPASSIONATE APPROACHABLE TOWARDS THOSE WITH PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OR TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THEIR LIVES AND AVOID THE BARRIERS THAT TOO OFTEN LEAVE BACK. TO JAIL OR PRISON SPECT WE ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK KALRA. MS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AYE AYES AYE RISES A CO AUTHOR IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB SEVEN THREE ONE TODAY CALIFORNIANS WITH CONVICTIONS FACE OVER FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED LAWS THAT PLACE POST SENTENCE COMPLETION RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR LIVES THROUGH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS NEARLY 75% OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED. A YEAR AFTER RELEASE THE AFFECTS OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT VARY BY RACE BUT AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED EXPERTS IN REENTRY OFTEN THIS BARRIERS TO STABLE HOUSING IS AMONG THE MOST DIFFICULT BARRIERS I WOULD PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS THAT THEY FACE STABLE HOUSING LIKE EMPLOYMENT IS STRONGLY CORRELATED. OUT WOULD REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND INCREASED CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS TO BECOME CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE CONTINUE TO PUNISH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND SHOULD HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART THEIR LIVES AND BE ABLE TO BE THRIVING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. AN AYE VOTE. THANK A MYSTERY- MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION- I HEARD A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL MAY PREVENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES. WE HAD DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE TEACHERS COMMISSION- AND- WITH CITY REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE- BIG CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY REGULARLY GET FROM D. O. J. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMISSIONS AS WELL IN THE- SENATOR HAS ABSOLUTELY AGREED TO WORK WITH THEM TO IRON OUT ANY PARTICULAR. CLASSIFICATIONS OR THE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT IN MY DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMISSION I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET THERE BUT THEY'LL BE GETTING ANY LAST INFORMATION OR THE CRITICAL INFORMATION THEY'LL NEED. FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS. MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT DOESN'T CONCERNS- SO I WAS PRESENT FOR GIRLS SOFTBALL THE CANNELLA GROVE AND BECAUSE ALWAYS YOU DEAL WITH KIDS YOU GET THE DOJ RETURNS EVERYBODY'S FINGERPRINTED AND WE HAD SOMEONE IS GONNA BE TREASURER HE HAD MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS FOR EMBEZZLEMENT. OBVIOUS ARE YOU NOT RELEASES CRIMINAL RECORD BUT I MADE SURE THE PRESIDENT OF MY OWN THAT HE DIDN'T. WAS INVOLVED MONEY SO THAT WAS AN ISSUE OF CONCERN. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF THAT RIGHT WITHOUT OBJECTION. THANK YOU IF THAT RECORDS EXPUNGED IT'S BEEN SAY SEVEN YEARS THE OWNER THE BUSINESS OWNER BANK WOULDN'T KNOW THAT I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED IS ON CHILD ANNOYANCE ANY CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN OF MR METERS THERE SEVERAL KINDS OF THE MISDEMEANORS FILTER EXPLAINED SO YOU CAN BE A SCHOOL EMPLOYER BUS DRIVER YOU WANT TO HIRE THAT PERSON SO JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING BUT A FELONY LOTS OF MISDEMEANOR CHILD THINGS. EMPLOYERS NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE HIRING AND I'M I'M ALL FOR HEY IF YOU DID SOME OTHER CRIMES ASSAULT INSULT BETTER THINGS LIKE THAT SO I FOR SECOND CHANCE BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE IF SOMEONE'S DOING THINGS TO CHILDREN YOU SHOULD NOT BE ADVOCATING FOR THEM. OKAY I'M NOT PULL MY HAND UP AND SAY OKAY. YOU'RE DOING THIS SO YOU DESERVE A BREAK. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT SHOCKED THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS. THAT'S A BIG ONE. AND WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE INDECENT EXPOSURE. THAT HAPPENS A LOT SOMEONE'S DOING THAT. DO WHAT THEY WORK IN A SCHOOL. SEWER DAYCARE CENTER SO. I GUESS IT IT'S A SLUSH ME SOMETIME WHEN WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE IN AND CHANGE THINGS. BUT DAMMIT. WHY ADVOCATE FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT. THERE'S NO REASON. TO KEEP THAT PERSON THEY SHOULD GET A BREAK BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. THE VAST MAJORITY PUBLIC WILL NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVER. EVER NEVER TOUCH A KID NEVER DO THAT LIEU THAT BOTTOM LINE IN THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT'S BEEN THIRTY YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN THAT. PARTICULAR REPORT FROM SOMEONE FROM A VICTIM A KID THIS HAS HAPPENED TO THE WAY HOME WALKING HOME. THAT'S NOT DAILY BASIS OR SOMEONE DOES CRAZY STUFF LIKE THAT. SO LIKE I SAID. I'M NOT ADVOCATING FORM AND THEY SHOULD NOT GET A BREAK. FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS OF COURSE BUT FOR SOME REASON WE ALWAYS WANT TO. LET EVERYBODY IN THERE. AND IF YOUR SEX OFFENDER. OF SOME SORT. YOU SHOULD NOT GET A BREAK BECAUSE NINETY NINE POINT 9% THE PUBLIC WILL NEVER EVER DO THAT. SO I CAN WHEN I SEE PEOPLE STAND UP AND ADVOCATE FORM. INTO A GREAT IS NOT YOUR BILL. BUT THE TAX SAID THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD REASON WE MAKE OURSELVES. LOOK SILLY IN THE PUBLIC AND YOU ASK THEM OUT THERE LIKE THAT THAT WE BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES REDEMPTION. BUT NOT FOR THESE PEOPLE. SO LIKE I SAID. ON THE MISDEMEANOR STUFF. THERE'S A LOT OF MISDEMEANORS OTHER CRIMES ARE CONSIDERED SERIOUS CRIMES OR VIOLENT CRIMES. THERE'S ABOUT SIXTEEN CRIMES I MEAN YOU KNOW I MEAN GONE INTO THAT YET. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT CRIMES ARE TREATED VIOLENT. IT IS LENGTHY LIST SO THERE'S A LOT INVOLVED A LOT OF PARTS SO. I SAID I SUPPORT IT BUT LIKE I SAID. FOR SOME THESE FOLKS WE SHOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR. THANK YOU MISS COOPER. MISTER BRIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MRS BIGGER AND TIMINGS MISTER BRIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TAKING A MAJOR US THOSE QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WILL MISTER BRIAN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU. WHY ADVOCATE FORM WHY HIRE THEM. WHY GIVE THEM A PLACE TO LIVE WHY FREEDOM WATCH BELOW THEM WHY DON'T WE JUST INCARCERATE THEM FOREVER. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE ON THE FLOOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING WE KEEP THESE CONVENTIONS OVER PEOPLE IT'S EITHER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD THEY CAN'T GET HOUSES. THEY CAN'T GET EMPLOYMENT. THEY STRUGGLE TO BECOME ON HEALTH. INDECENT EXPOSURE IN THE BILL FROM HERE ON THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE. SIX CRIMES VIOLENT CRIMES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SUNSET BILL THE THOUGHTFUL BILL BUILT ON THE BANDOBAST THINKING IT BUILT ON THE IDEA THAT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE DON'T RECIDIVISTS WHEN THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY. AND THIS IS A STATE WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY WE'VE GOT A LONG YEAR WHICH WAS THE IN THE SESSION LET'S NOT GO BACKWARDS RIGHT AT THE FINISH LINE. MISTER MESS YOUR READINESS.

I'LL TELL YA. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS ISSUES WE ALL KNOW THAT IT DOES WE KNOW THAT IT DOES AND SOME OF THE STUFF IS BROUGHT BEFORE US I THINK WE GO A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR. BUT IF WE FORGOTTEN IF WE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF REDEMPTION. ABOUT REDEMPTION. IT PEOPLE CAN DO BAD THINGS. BUT MAKE THEMSELVES WHOLE AGAIN IF WE DISPOSE OF FOLKS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM L. A. HAD SAID. WE'VE LOST OUR WAY AND WE'VE WHAT WE'VE DONE WE SAID THE POLITICS ARE TOO TOUGH. THE POLITICS ARE TOO TOUGH I VOTE FOR THIS. IT COULD HURT ME MY NEXT REELECTION. AS IF YOUR RE PEOPLE. I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION.

SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN AS A LIFETIME OF BEING A VICTIM. A LIFETIME OF THE SCARS LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE OF OTHERS BEHAVIOR. A LOT OF THESE CONVICTIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR PLEASE FOLKS WE'RE NOT REALLY WHAT HAPPENED. THOSE ARE FACTS. PLEASE CONSIDER THE FACTS AND NOT JUST THE FICTION. THANK YOU MEMBERS.
