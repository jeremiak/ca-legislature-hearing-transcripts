FUNDING THAT'S A REALLY

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:48.613
IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.947
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO VERY

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.215
LARGE DISASTERS.

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:52.683
SO WHEN THE STATE EXPERIENCES

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.018
DISASTERS OF THE SCALE WITH

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.353
EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY A

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.854
NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE LAST

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.623
COUPLE OF YEARS WE CAN SOMETIMES

00:35:58.689 --> 00:35:59.690
GET WHAT'S CALLED A MAJOR

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:00.992
DISASTER DECLARATION.

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:02.627
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MAKES

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:03.895
AVAILABLE A VARIETY OF TYPES OF

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.030
FEDERAL FUNDING INCLUDING FOR

THINGS LIKE FIRE RESPONSE DEBRIS

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.634
REMOVAL --

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.269
ALSO IT HELPS.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:12.970
I STILL WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.539
REBUILDING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:15.907
AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER FEDERAL

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.375
PROGRAM THAT IT MAKES AVAILABLE

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.476
WHICH I'M GONNA ALSO COME BACK

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:19.777

HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM.

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:30.321
AND THIS PROGRAM IS AT EIGHT

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:30.955
BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.557
IT IS WITH THE STATE HAS

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.091
EXPERIENCED VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:36.093
DISASTERS IT PROVIDES FUNDING TO

HELP US MITIGATE FUTURE

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.563
DISASTERS.

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.665
SO UP 220% OF THE FEDERAL

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.199
ASSISTANCE WE GET FOR SHIP

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.035
RESPONDING TO REBUILDING FROM

FUTURE DISASTERS.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:53.878
SO JUST ONE THING TO KEEP IN

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.646
MIND IS TYPICALLY WITH FEDERAL

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.049
GADIS FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS IF

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:58.983
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COVERS

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.252
ABOUT 75% OF THE COST USUALLY

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.054
THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.022
COVER THE REMAINING 25% ALTHOUGH

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.157
THAT CAN VARY.

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:08.526
DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:09.427
FACTORS.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:11.262
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO WE

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:12.363
SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE RECENT

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.731
BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THE

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:15.433
DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED THE LAST

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.768
FEW YEARS THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE.

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:18.869
THE FUNDING IT'S BEEN PROVIDED

SUMMARIZES THOSE AUGMENTATIONS

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.789
AND THERE'S A LOT GOING IN ON IN

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.890
THIS CHART I'M NOT GONNA GO

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:42.793
THROUGH EVERY ITEM BECAUSE IT'S

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.829

THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AND

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.738
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:28.839
PROPOSAL THAT WAS TEN MILLION

AT ANOTHER MAJOR THEME YOU'LL

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.722
SEE A MULTIPLE YEARS OF FUNDING

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:45.489

ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO BUILD OUT

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:50.194
THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THAT

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.228
SYSTEM --

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:52.063

SPECIFICALLY IS THE NINE ONE ONE

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:01.806
SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM --

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.007
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:03.574
CONSIDERED BY THIS COMMITTEE

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.242
LAST YEAR AND APPROVED BY THIS

COMMITTEE AND BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.813
AND THAT FINDS AN UPGRADE OF THE

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:09.647
NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS WHAT'S

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:11.649
KNOWN AS THE NEXT GEN NINE ONE

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.516
SYSTEM.

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.285
OUT OF A SPECIAL FUNDS --

00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.153
AND THERE'S SOME STRUCTURAL

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.622
IMBALANCES BATTLE BUT ON THE

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.925
NEXT PAGE.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.927
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.562
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:27.531
PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:28.065
NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.800
BUDGET PACKAGE THE FIRST TO I'M

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.235
NOT GONNA GO INTO MUCH DETAIL

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.770
THOSE WERE BOTH INCLUDED AS PART

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.205
OF AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.306
ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.307
LEGISLATURE.

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.408
ON THERE IS SOME MONEY FOR

PUBLIC EDUCATION AS WELL AS A

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.012
GENERAL FUND LOAN IN EIGHTEEN

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:42.680
NINETEEN TO SUPPORT THE NINE ONE

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:43.748
ONE SYSTEM --

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.783
AND THEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.917
YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.219
SEVERAL PROPOSALS --

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:49.453
WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.688
SUBCOMMITTEE --

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.156
AT AN UPCOMING HEARING I BELIEVE

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.457
I'VE JUST BRIEFLY GOING TO

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.226
SUMMARIZE SOME OF THOSE --

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.228
THERE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.963
ONGOING INCREASE THE FEDERAL

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.131
TRUST FUND AT THE ALREADY.

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:01.198
I RELATED TO THAT HAZARD

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:02.566
MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM THAT I

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:05.102
MENTIONED SO THIS THE STATE IS --

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:06.837
EXPECTING TO RECEIVE A BILLION

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.372
DOLLARS FROM THIS PROGRAM.

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:08.939
SO THAT COULD BE A BILLION

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.441
DOLLARS THAT WE CAN INVEST IN

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.976
OUR COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM BE

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.778
MORE RESILIENT TO POTENTIAL

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.212
DISASTERS WHETHER IT BE

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.914
HARDENING BUILDINGS FOR

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.983
EARTHQUAKES IN MAKING THE MORE --

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.084
STRENGTH STRONGER FOR

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.652
EARTHQUAKES OR CREATING

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:24.688
DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR FIRES ON

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.890
ALL THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:28.092
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING SO

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.360
THERE COULD BE A BILLION DOLLARS

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.128
AND THE DEPARTMENT IS --

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:34.365
WORKING TOWARDS --

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:34.899
PROVIDING GRANTS FOR THAT

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:38.035
FUNDING GRANTS.

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:40.638
AT THE SECOND BULLET HERE IS

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:41.672
RELATED TO THE NINE ONE ONE

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:42.840
SYSTEM THERE ACTUALLY TWO

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:44.809
SEPARATE PROPOSALS HERE WHAT IS

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.010

BROADBAND --

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.764
TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE NINE

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:07.598
ONE ONE SYSTEM.

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:08.432
THERE'S ALSO TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.835

PRE POSITIONING OF THOSE ENGINES

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.606

FUNDING AUGMENTATION FOR THAT.

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:30.888
PROBABLY REFLECTS JUST THAT THE

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:34.191
GROWING AMOUNT OF DISASTERS

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.860

PROPOSALS.

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:33.684

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:34.818
DID I MISUNDERSTAND THAT WEARS

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.654
YEAH INCOME FROM SO THERE'S A

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.454
BILL THERE'S WE'RE EXPECTING

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.522
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.124
NOT GONNA SEE THAT REFLECTED IN

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.558
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THERE'S

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:42.893
A COUPLE REASONS WHY.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.295
ONE THE DEPARTMENT HAS A BASE

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:45.663
BUDGET AMOUNT TO RECEIVE FEDERAL

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.898
FUNDS AND SO AND THAT'S QUITE

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:48.832
SUBSTANTIAL SO THEY CAN ALREADY

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.334
RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF FEDERAL

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.001

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.069
AUGMENTATION.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.671
AND THEN ALSO THE SIXTY MILLION

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:54.738
IS -- AN

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.240
ONGOING FUNDING --

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.608

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:58.909
EXPECTING TO RECEIVE THAT

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.377
FEDERAL FUNDING --

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.413
FIND INCREASE OVER SEVERAL YEARS

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:04.214
AND SO THEY ARE PROPOSING TO

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.816
SIXTY MILLION TO ALLOW THEM TO

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.518
RECEIVE IT OVER SEVERAL YEARS SO

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.053
ULTIMATELY WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.287
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS BUT

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.889
WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT ALL IS A

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.157
BUDGET INCREASE THIS YEAR.

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.159
ON BUT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:18.095
LEGISLATURE WILL BE MADE VERY

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.363
SOON -- AND

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.397
THEIR DIFFERENT TIMELINES FOR

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.266
THE SPECIFIC ONES BUT IT IS

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.534
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.169
ONE OF WANNA BE KEEPING AN EYE

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:26.870
ON NOT BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:28.205
MONEY FOR THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.873
IN THE BECOMING FOR THE FIT YES

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.442
THIS IS FEDERAL FUNDING NOT

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.609
STATE FUNDING.

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.144

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.079
EIGHTY THREE MILLION AND THEN

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:35.946
THIRTY MILLION OF TRYING TO

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:36.847

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:37.982
THAT'S NOT IT QUITE CLOSE TO A

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.516
BILLION YEAH NO SORRY THE

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:40.351

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:29.991
INITIATING RECOVERY VERY

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:32.627
DIFFICULT.

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:33.461
WITH THE FREQUENCY DISASTERS

PROTOCOLS SYSTEM.

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:46.808
RECOVERY IS NOT EVEN PART OF THE

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:48.009
SAMS PROCESS.

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:50.511

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.191
AGENCIES.

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.626
HISTORICALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:06.227
ELEVEN IT WAS ROUTINE FOR THE

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.128
LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:08.596

IT HAD SO MANY.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:34.689
OTHERS NOT DECLARED AS OFTEN.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.424
ARE THE IMPACTS THE UP THE FACT

IS THAT INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:53.574
WAS NOT PART OF THE DECORATION.

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:55.343
BUT IT WAS SORELY NEEDED BY OUR

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:56.844
PUBLIC WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.613

AVAILABLE SYSTEMS.

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:39.754
THE ATTEMPT TO CREATING A COMMON

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.455
OPERATING PICTURE IS CRITICAL

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.557
AND NECESSARY DURING RESPONSE.

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.226

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:00.608
IS LOCAL.

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:02.076
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO DEVELOP A

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.711
SYSTEM FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL UP.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.579

RECOVERY COSTS ARE SAVED.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:30.571
IT IS BETTER TO FOCUS ON

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.406
PLANNING TRAINING MITIGATING A

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:33.874

RIGHT AS HOLLY A VERY ELOQUENTLY --

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.903
ILLUSTRATED.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.738
IT RUNS THE GAMUT FROM THE SAN

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.606
DIEGO COUNTY THAT HAS I THINK

01:35:12.673 --> 01:35:14.642
OVER A DOZEN STAFF TO A MODOC

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:16.077
COUNTY THAT HAS.

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.545
AN INDIVIDUAL DOING IT ALONG

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:19.580
WITH FOUR OTHER DUTIES WITHIN

01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:21.449
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:22.817
SO -- IN THE

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:27.054
YES OFFICES ARE ORGANIZED A DIFF --

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.255
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:29.824
IN FRONT OF ME BUT ACROSS THE

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:31.192
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES --

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:32.960
MOST OF THEM --

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:33.928
WOULD PROBABLY TWO THIRDS OF

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:35.329
THEM ARE AT IN IN EITHER LAW

ENFORCEMENT OR FIRE.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.134
BUT THE REST ARE ORGANIZED IN CA

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:41.502
OWES OFFICE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.437
OFFICES --

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:45.139
PUBLIC WORKS OFFICES --

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:47.908
AND THE COMMITMENT THAT THOSE

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:50.177
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE TO

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:51.979
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:53.714
DIFFERENT COUNTY TO COUNTY AND A

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.483
LOT OF THAT IS DRIVEN BY.

01:35:55.549 --> 01:35:56.750
THEIR EXPERIENCES THOSE

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.519
JURISDICTIONS SIMILAR TO SAN

01:35:58.586 --> 01:35:59.753
DIEGO THAT HAVE --

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.522
OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:04.792
EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS.

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM --

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.367
BUT A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS I

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:13.934
THINK IT CONTINUES TO BE AN

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.669
EDUCATION FOLKS ARE VERY

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.338
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT --

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:19.940
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE AND EMS

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:22.209
PERSONNEL DO VERY HEROICALLY.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:24.478
AND THE COMMITMENT OF OF

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:25.813
RESOURCES --

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.481
IS IS PROVIDED THEY'RE NOT

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:28.749
ALWAYS THE SAME --

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:30.184
BECAUSE OF THAT AGAINST

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:33.921
AMBIGUOUS NATURE MANAGEMENT --

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.523
SO THERE'S NOT NOT THE SAME

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:38.259
LEVEL OF COMMITMENT.

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:40.127
WHAT IMPACT OR HAVE WE HAD A

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:41.695
CHANCE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:43.197
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:44.098
HELPING?

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:45.466
WITH THIS HAVE THEY BEEN VERY

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:46.734
HELPFUL HAVE THE IMPEDED

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.602
PROGRESS AND WHAT IT WHAT IS

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.171
HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:51.739
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM --

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:54.308
WE JUST WERE RECENTLY MADE AWARE

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.577
OF SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT --

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.779
IS BEING PROPOSED AND WE'RE

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:00.114
SAYING AS FAR AS OUR FINANCIAL

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.448
COMMITMENT IT IS --

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:02.950
THE SAME OR IN SOME CASES A

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:04.251
LITTLE HIGHER.

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.653
SO I THINK THAT THEIR COMMITMENT

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.655
DEALING AT THIS AS ON A NATIONAL

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.256
BASIS WITH SO MANY STATES BEING

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:09.957
HIT.

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:11.659
OTHER IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:13.794
ADDITIONALLY THE ENACTMENT OF

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:16.363
WHAT ERIC VIEWED AS A LONG TERM

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.300
RECOVERY --

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:22.703
WE HAD. FOR A DISASTER.

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:23.871
RECOVERY FRAMEWORK --

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:24.838
THAT.

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.006
ALLOWS FOR THE MISSION TASKING A

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:27.575
FEDERAL ENTITY SUCH AS HUD COME

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.176
SIT WITH THE STATE AND THE

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.945
LOCALS TO TO ADDRESS COMPLEX

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:31.845
ISSUES.

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:33.380
OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.315
SERVICES --

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.983
PERSONNEL TO COME WITH OUR

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:37.284
PUBLIC HEALTH TO WORK OUT

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.086
HOSPITALS AND OUR OTHER SOCIAL

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.421
SERVICES ISSUES.

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:41.722
SO I THINK THE COMMITMENT I

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:42.957
THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.058
GOVERNMENT I THINK THE

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.759
COMMITMENT IS THERE.

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:47.061
AN EIGHT BUT I THINK AS WITH

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.295
EVERYTHING THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.330
FOR IMPROVEMENT THE

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:50.931
DOCUMENTATION THE CERTIFICATION

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:53.400
THE QUALIFICATIONS ALL VERY --

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.436
VERY IMPORTANT AT ALL LEVELS OF

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:58.739
GOVERNMENT.

01:37:58.806 --> 01:37:58.939
THERE.

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.441
ARE WE AT YOUR RECOMMENDATION --

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:03.210
YOUR COM THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.845
SHOULD MOVE UP FROM THE LOCAL TO

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:07.214
THE STATE LEVEL IN TERMS OF

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:08.282
PLANNING --

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:10.084
DO WE HAVE THAT IN PLACE IN

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:12.086
TERMS OF A ONGOING RELATIONSHIP

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:14.121
WITH LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.823
INCLUDE THEM IN THE PLANNING AND

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:17.758
THE RESOURCE DISTRIBUTE

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:18.425
DISTRIBUTION AND THINGS OF THAT

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.360
NATURE.

START.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.198
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE SAM'S

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:25.432
PROCESS REALLY CLEARLY

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:28.068
IDENTIFIES FIVE LEVELS OF

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:29.436
RESPONSE IN COORDINATION.

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.471
AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE IS

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:33.140
A LOT OF FREE STUFF OF DEMAND IN

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:35.476
ELEMENTS PUT ON US.

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:36.477
I ENDED BE KEY RIGHT NOW WHAT I

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:39.013
WAS REFERRING TO WAS THE CAL THE

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:42.850
CAL E. O. C. OR WEB EOC PLATFORM.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.919
INFORMATION HOW IT SHARES FROM

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.388
THE FEEL ALL THE WAY UP THE

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:48.322
HELLO YES LEVEL.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.890
WELL THE SYSTEM THAT'S AVAILABLE

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.525
STOPS FOR OUR JURISDICTIONS

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:52.860
STOPPED AT THE COUNTY.

01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:54.428
THE LOCAL LEVEL DOESN'T HAVE

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.363
ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.365
IT UNTIL THE LAST YEAR SO WE ARE

01:38:58.432 --> 01:38:59.767
WORKING ON DEVELOPING THE

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.736
SYSTEMS BUT IT'S AN OLDER SYSTEM

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.505
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE TO BEGIN

01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:05.639
THAT THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.207
WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:08.809
TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN HELP.

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:12.579
MANAGE THE DATA THE DATA STREAM

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.181
THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW AND THERE

01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:15.849
ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT COULD

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:17.751
BE EFFECTIVE IN THE SHARING.

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:19.753
OF INFORMATION FROM THE FIELD

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.623
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATE.

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:23.857
YEAH THEM THAT'S A VERY GOOD

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.859
POINT HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT WE

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:27.294
ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.063
IMPROVE THAT SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.497
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:31.832
CRITICAL SO WE HAVE A COUPLE

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.867
OTHER TOOLS BUT I KNOW THE

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:34.802
DIRECTOR MET WITH CEASE --

01:39:34.868 --> 01:39:36.437
THE OTHER DAY AND I'M SURE THIS

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:37.838
MAY HAVE COME UP BUT HE IS VERY

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.907
OPEN TO LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:42.042
IMPROVE THE THE SYSTEM OR

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:44.144
SYSTEMS THAT WE USE.

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:46.246
DO YOU SEE ANY OF IT AND

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:47.548
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT THAT'S IT

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:48.582
CONCERNING THE GAP THAT'S THERE

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.484
DO YOU SEE ANY ADDITIONAL GAPS

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.586
THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT --

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.221
WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.423
EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THE

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:57.591
OPERATIONS WELL ONE OF THE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.093
THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS A

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:00.661
CREDENTIALING WHICH IS FABULOUS

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.463
IT'S SOMETHING WE AT LOCAL

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.063
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN LOOKING

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:04.064
TOWARD.

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.666
AND HELPING UNDERSTAND HOW WE

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:06.266
CAN.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:08.168
IMPLEMENT THAT WITHIN THE LOCAL

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:09.603

FIRE LAW THE VERY WELL

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:16.176
ESTABLISHED.

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:17.378
VERY SMOOTH.

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.545
THERE'S A SYSTEM CALLED AM OF

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:20.247
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MUTUAL AID

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:22.483
SYSTEM WHICH I DID NOT GET INTO

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:23.584
WITH THE TIME CONSTRAINT.

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:26.920
BUT THAT DOES NEED SUPPORT DOES

01:40:26.987 --> 01:40:29.957
NEED NURTURING PRIMARILY BECAUSE

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:31.859
WHAT WE SEE THE LOCAL LEVEL IS

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.260
THIS THE LONG FIRE.

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:35.229
IS VERY WELL INTEGRATED AT THE

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:50.811
THOSE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT WE

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.112
CAN THE CREDENTIALING.

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:54.615

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:16.590
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK JUST

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:17.958
BECAUSE OF THE SHEER NUMBER OF

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:18.959
EVENTS WE'VE HAD IN THE

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:20.527
COMPLEXITIES OF THOSE EVENTS

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:21.695
EACH OF EACH OF THAT.

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.063
THE LAST THREE EVENTS WE PAT

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:25.399
EACH ONE HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY

01:43:25.465 --> 01:43:26.934
MORE COMPLEX THAN THE LAST --

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.037
WE ARE SEEING OUR STATE AGENCIES --

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:32.773
THAT HAVE CRITICAL ROLES TO PLAY

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:36.009
WHETHER IT'S PROCUREMENT WHETHER

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:36.877

WE HAVE SEEN THOSE STATE

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.947
AGENCIES AND THEIR EMERGENCY

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.548
MANAGEMENT COMPONENT WITHIN THAT

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.150
AGENCY STEP UP THEIR GAME

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.785
SIGNIFICANTLY --

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.720
IN IN AREAS WHERE CALAWAY YES

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.121
USED TO HAVE TO TAKE A MORE

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:50.223
HANDS ON ROLE IN IN DIFFERENT --

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.459

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:53.794
SUPPORT OF COMMUNITIES WE GOT

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.696
STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE TAKING

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.197
THEIR ASSIGNMENT AND RUNNING

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.099
WITH IT VERY EFFECTIVELY --

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:00.601

NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS.

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.733
IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY CAN

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.134
DO AS A SUPPORT MECHANISM.

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:15.902
AND BLENDING ALL THAT BECAUSE WE

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:17.304
KNOW WE AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.940
CAN'T DO IT ALL OURSELVES.

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.475
WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BEST

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:23.210

DON'T CHANGE UP.

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:31.918
AND LOOK AT SAM'S IN OUR OWN

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.820
ORGANIZATION AS A WAY OF SAYING

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.122
HEY WE HAVE TO OPEN UP SAM'S

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:37.624

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:38.492
IT IT'S OLD.

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:42.629
THIS TIME TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:46.299
WHAT THAT MEANS TO US.

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:47.768
THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING I I I I

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:49.202
CAN REMEMBER AS OF BEING A PART

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.604
OF ONE OF THE SAN DIEGO FIRE

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:51.204
SOME YEARS AGO.

01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:51.838
THAT THE LOOK LIKE THE BIGGEST

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:52.439
PROBLEMS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:54.775
WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY. TO OF

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:57.477
ORDER THE PLANE AND THAT WAS A

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.279
BIG ISSUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:00.580
THEY HAD NOT HAD TO DO THAT

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:01.915
BEFORE AND SO WE WE HAVE THESE

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:03.784
PLANES THAT COULD DROP THE STUFF

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:04.417
EVERYWHERE.

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:06.253
AND THEY SPENT FOREVER TRYING TO

01:47:06.319 --> 01:47:09.322
FIGURE OUT WHO TO WHERE WE NEED

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:10.624
TO THE GORE NOT WE WAS VERY LATE

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:11.725
IN THE GAME.

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.627
BUT THERE WAS A BIG ISSUE ABOUT

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:16.163
THAT AND MUCH FEAR AFTERWARDS SO

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:17.931
THAT WAS THEN AT THAT POINT.

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.332
A DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.934
COORDINATE THIS IN ADVANCE OF

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:21.802
NOT WAIT TO THE FIRE TO FIGURE

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:23.603
OUT WHO HAS WHO CAN SIGN THE

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.038
PIECE OF PAPER RIGHT THAT WE

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.173
NEED TO HAVE SOME COORDINATION

01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:27.941
AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.075
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED

01:47:29.142 --> 01:47:30.677
THE PLANES. TO TO TO FLY OVER

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:32.712
THIS HUGE PLANES THAT WERE RUN

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:33.814
BY I DON'T KNOW WITH US MARINES

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:34.848
WHAT IS BY THE FEDERAL

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:37.450
GOVERNMENT AND WE COULD NOT GET

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:38.752
WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY TO SIGN.

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.854
IT AND SO YOU HIT ON SOMETHING

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.189
ELSE THAT IS WORKING A MUCH

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:43.857
BETTER AND THAT WAS THE

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:45.358
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR UNIFIED

01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:46.459
COORDINATING GROUP.

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:48.161
THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE MILITARY

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:49.529
AND THE NATIONAL GUARD SO THAT

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.097
THOSE WHEN THEY BECOME ISSUES

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:52.766

PHONE CALLS.

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:58.505
AND GET IT RESOLVED.

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:00.774
BY TRAGEDY HAPPENED SAN DIEGO

TRYING TO GET SOME RELIEF AND NO

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:06.179
ONE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:11.651
THE ORDER THE PLANE.

01:48:11.718 --> 01:48:15.789
