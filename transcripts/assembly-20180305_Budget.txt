THANK YOU SB ONE ONE EIGHT IS A TRAILER BILL WHICH DEALS WITH CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD ALLOW THE THREE MAIN CANNABIS LICENSING ENTITIES TO PROCESS FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO ISSUE ANNUAL LICENSE SAYS. THE FBI WAS REQUIRING THAT EACH ENTITY IS SPECIFIED ON IN STATUTES RECEIVE THE FBI CONVICTION INFORMATION RELATED TO CANNABIS LICENSES THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM THE CANNABIS CONTROL FUND. A WHICH IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN FROM E. GENERAL FUND LOAN TO SUPPLY PROPRIETARY PLANT AND PACKAGE ON A RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TAGS TO BE USED BY ANNUAL LICENSEES TO TRACK CANNABIS AND CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS. THE COST WAS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF ENACTMENT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. BUT THIS APPROPRIATION IS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM HOW FOR ANNUAL LICENSEES. THE COMMITMENT. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS ROBOT. SOME IT'S COSTA REGARDING THE TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FOR THE RFID TAGS THAT'S A CURRENT FISCAL YEAR APPRPRIATION AND. OF MY QUESTION IS I. WORLDLY ISSUING TEMPORARY LICENSES RIGHT NOW AND THOSE LICENSE HOLDERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM SO I WAS WONDERING WHY WE NEEDED A CURRENT FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATION. INSTEAD OF DOING THIS AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON. I CAN'T COUNT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. FBI BACKGROUND CHECK LANGUAGE WILL ALLOW US TO ISSUE IN NO LICENSES AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS IS HOW IMPLEMENTED TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM WHICH WE HOPE TO DO IN ADVANCE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. SO ONCE THAT LANGUAGES AVAILABLE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE COMPLETED WE CAN ISSUEANYA LICENSES WITHIN TEN DAYS THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING AND THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM AND HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO EMPLOY ABOUT PUT ALL THEIR. INVENTORY IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT IS OUR MECHANISM TO GET THE LICENSEE GROUPS INTO THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM IN THIS PUBLICIST ACTUALLY DIE AND WE NEED THOSE TAGS TO DO THAT. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FBI BACKGROUND CHECK LANGUAGE SO TO BE CLEAR WHAT IT WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. PERMANENT LICENSEES THAT OUR PARTICIPATING IN TRACK AND TRACE BEFORE. THE BUDGET ACT GOES INTO EFFECT ON JULY FIRST THAT'S THE INTENT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING THE CHANGE WE IT'S CONTINGENT UPON THE FBI AGREEING TO THE STATUTORY CHANGES AND THEN PROVIDING THE CONVICTION INFORMATION THAT WE NEED. TIM CLEAR SOMEONE ON A BACKGROUND CHECK OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IN THE MIDST COST I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A STATEMENT TO RESPOND ON. SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND.

THANK YOU A MOVIE ON THE SP ONE TWENTY HUMAN SERVICES THIS COST. THANK YOU SB ONE TWENTIES ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL CONTAINS THREE PROVISIONS THE FIRST PROVISION DEALS WITH THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM IT CLARIFIES FOR COUNTIES THAT NEGOTIATE A WAGE SUPPLEMENT FOR AYE EACH. AT THAT PROVIDERS THE TIMING FOR WHEN THE WAGE SUPPLEMENT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE COUNTIES INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER RATE. I WOULD NOT THE ADMINISTRATION COUNTIES AND LABOR SUPPORT THIS LANGUAGE THE SECOND PROVISION HAS TO DO WITH FOSTER CARE AND SPECIFICALLY WITH RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL DELAYS. THE LANGUAGE PROVIDES FOR PAYMENTS TO RELATIVE CAREGIVERS TO BEGIN PRIOR TO THE RESOURCES FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS BEING COMPLETED UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE MAJOR COMPONENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS. FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS TO NON FEDERALLY ELIGIBLE RELATIVE CAREGIVERS ARE REQUIRED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. TO RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL IF THE CHILD HAS BEEN PLACED WITH THE CARE. EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS TO NON RELATIVE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS AND FEDERALLY ELIGIBLE RELATIVE CAREGIVERS ARE REQUIRED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS PRIOR TO RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL IF THE CHILD HAS BEEN PLACED WITH THE CAREGIVER. THE STATE WILL COVER THE COUNTIES NON FEDERAL SHARE OF THESE PAYMENTS FOR UP TO SIXTY DAYS. IF A COUNTY CAN DEMONSTRATE GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE SUBMITS A PLAN TO ELIMINATE THEIR RFA BACKLOG. UP BY SEPTEMBER FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THE COUNTY SHARE OF EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE COSTS FOR UP TO SIXTY DAYS. THROUGH THE END OF JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS LANGUAGE PROVIDE SHORT TERM. SOLUTION FOR CAREGIVERS EXPERIENCING DELAYED RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL BY ALLOWING PAYMENTS TO FLOW PRIOR TO THEIR APPROVAL. THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO PROPOSE A LONG TERM SOLUTION. FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CAN'T AYE CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE MAY REVISE PROCESS. LASTLY THE TRAILER BILL BEFORE YOU CONTAINS PROVISIONS TO CLEAN UP SB TO THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE ADDITIONAL FEES IMPOSED BY S. B. TO DO NOT APPLY TO THE STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION OF NEW REVENUE FROM THIS I SEVENTY FIVE HIGH DOLLAR REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS RECORDING FEE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STATE TRANSACTIONS EXEMPTED BY THIS BILL EQUATING TO ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. TO THE COMMITTEE MISS RACE. I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE WE HAVE MANY OF OUR FOSTER FAMILIES THAT ARE. NOT BEING PAID AND IT BECOMES SUCH A BURDEN SO I JUST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THIS IN THIS LANGUAGE. THANK YOU MISTER ABILITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MISSED BECAUSE I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE SP TO CLEAN UP LANGUAGE. A. I THINK THAT IT WE WOULD BE UNANIMOUS IN SAYING THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE AMBIGUITY AND THAT LANGUAGE AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS AMBIGUITY IN LINE. THAT LEGISLATURE PASSED THAT WHAT LAST YEAR SO WE NEED TO CLARIFY WHETHER OR NOT THAT FEE APPLIES TO. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER TO ME THAT ISSUE IS SEPARATE FROM THE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW SHOULD. COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE REQUIRED TO PAY THIS FEE AND I WONDER WHAT THE ARGUMENT. IS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T ANOTHER SOME HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME WHEN A CONSTITUENT WHO IS A CONTRACTOR COMES TO ME AND SAYS. LOOK IF I HELPED BUILD A HOUSE AND I'M GONNA RECORD A MECHANIC'S LIEN BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET PAID. I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE BUT. A COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHO DOESN'T GET PAID. A PROPERTY TAX BILL. DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY THAT TO pSMITH PROPERTIES I WONDER WHAT THAT THE MEN THAT THE CONSTITUENTS HATE IT WHEN WE IN STATE GOVERNMENT EXEMPT OURSELVES FROM FEES THAT WE ASK THEM TO PAY THEY CALL THAT HYPOCRISY AND. THEY CAN HAVE A POINTS I WONDER WHAT YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT IS WHY SHOULD. COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE EXEMPT FROM PAYING THAT FEE. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I THINK A YOU'VE RAISED A GOOD POINT WHICH IS A POLICY POINT WE DO THIS LANGUAGE THOSE CLARIFYING TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT. S. B. TO A WE FELT IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THESE ENTITIES WERE EXEMPTED IN THAT LAW. ON WE SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE HEARD THAT THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT ON THAT AND SO WE SEEK THIS IS JUST CLARIFYING WHAT WAS OUR INTENT IN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. SO. WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY IS WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO OPEN UP THE POLICY DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE INTENT WAS THEY SHOULDN'T AND WE'RE JUST CLARIFYING THAT. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. BUT BY THE WAY I STILL THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE DEBATE ABOUT PAYING BECAUSE. I DON'T THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE AS. I DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR ON THAT POINT. IT SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER FABULOUS LEGISLATIVE ID. ARMY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO. WE WILL PICK UP THE MOTION. THOSE IN FAVOR OF SB. ONE TWENTY. ANTI SHORTS WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS IN STRONG SUPPORTOF THE PROVISIONS IN SB ONE TWENTY YOU TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR RELATIVES AND EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STEP UP IN EMERGENCIES TO PROVIDE HOMES FOR KIDS IN FOSTER CARE.

PROVISION TO PROVIDE OUR FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS AT TIME OF PLACEMENT I'LL APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE. PRIVATIZING THIS ISSUE AND APPRECIATE THE APPROACH TO PROVIDE SOME STATE FUNDING. TO ASSIST WITH THESE PAYMENTS AND FOR COUNTIES TO RECEIVE EXTENSION ON THAT FUNDING NOW SHOULD THERE BE. FACTORS OUTSIDE OF COUNTIES CONTROL IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS THINKING.
