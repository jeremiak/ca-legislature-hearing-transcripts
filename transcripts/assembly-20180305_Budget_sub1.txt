THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SUB. COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE. HEARING IT'S OUR SECOND HEARING OF THE YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ISSUE ONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY SURE. YEAH SO GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN'T WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I WILL CERTAINLY. DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT FINANCE THE FI. MISS SOMETHING OR FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST START OUT BY SAYING I'M GOVRNOR'S BUDGET AS IT WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY. IS ESTIMATING THAT WILL BE SEEKING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THERE'S A CHANGE OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO THE END. ON THERE'S A LOT OF. DIFFERENT REASONS FOR WHY THERE'S SOME COSTS THAT HAVE COME AND HIGHER THERE SOME REBATES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO. TALK THROUGH THAT BUT I THINK I'M OVERALL I'M SIPPING THROUGH THE ESTIMATE AND THE OVERALL BUDGET I'M WHEN YOU BREAK IT BETWEEN STATE OPERATIONS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE OPERATIONS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THREE. POINT NINE BILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. FOR. WHEN YOU BREAK THAT DOWN BETWEEN GENERAL FUND FEDERAL FUNDS AND SPECIAL FUNDS IT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE POINT NINE BILLION. IN GENERAL FUND SIXTY SEVEN POINT NINE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT ISN'T SPECIAL FUNDS SPECIAL FUNDS CAN BE. PROVIDER TAXES THEY CAN BE. LOCAL FUNDS FROM COUNTIES PUBLIC CONSTABLES OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES. IN ADDITION OUR BUDGET IS ALSO SEEKING. TO ESTABLISH FORTY ONE NEW POSITIONS INCLUDING CONVERTING EIGHTEEN POSITIONS FROM LIMITED TERM AND TO PERMANENT. SOME OF THE MAIN. POLICY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATION. AND I WILL DISCOVER THESE REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I THINK IN SOME CASES THE HEARING WILL EITHER TALK ABOUT THEM TODAY IN MORE DETAIL OR WE WILL BE SPEAKING AT THEM AND A SUBSEQUENT HEARING. WE'RE. LOOKING FOR APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR A HOME HEALTH RATE INCREASE USING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. THIS WOULD BE SIXTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDS THIRTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND PROP FIFTY SIX. THE THING TO NOTE ON THIS. HOME HEALTH INCREASE AS IT IS ONLY FOR THE FEE FOR SERVICE AND THE WAIVER POPULATION SO WE'RE NOT SEEKING A HOME HEALTH RATE INCREASE IN MANAGED CARE SO. WE ONLY IDENTIFIED TWO POTENTIAL BOTH PROVIDERS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO GET THAT RATE INCREASE. OVERALL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN. PROPOSED IT MAINTAINS THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND PAYMENTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE. ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL. FUNDING WOULD BE BROKEN BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND DENTAL PROVIDER GROUPS AND THEN WHAT I JUST SPOKE TO. AS WELL AS TO THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE HOME HEALTH RATE INCREASE. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION TO SUPPORT NEW GROWTH AND MEDI CAL. EXPENDITURES OVER AND THE PREVIOUS BUDGET ACT AND SO ALL TOLD AND. THE. TOTAL FUNDS WHEN YOU. COUNT THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE MATCH ITS ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS USING THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX OF THE NON FEDERAL SHARE. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT NOTE IS AN MEDI CAL COUNTY ADMIN. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY'S OVER THE PAST. SEVERAL YEARS TO I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT TRY TO FIND OUT TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO PAY FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES THE COUNTY'S CONDUCT ON OUR. PART FOR PURPOSES OF ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS I'M WE ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE THIS ALLOCATION UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT WE DID WAS WE HAD A BASE ALLOCATION OF ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAD COME IN? IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE KNEW THAT THE COUNTIES WERE GONNA HAVE AN INCREASED CASELOAD ESPECIALLY BECAUSE. AS WILL SPEAK TO CASELOAD IN JUST A MINUTE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T. NOW ELIGIBLE TO SEE COVERAGE WAS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A WORKLOAD IMPACT AND SO THERE HAD BEEN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATED TO THE COUNTIES TO HELP. ADDRESS THAT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR ON THIS BUDGET WE'RE I'M PROPOSING TO BASICALLY. MAKE THAT INTO ONE BASS ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WE WOULD BE PUTTING AN END TO THEIR BASE PAYMENT. AND THEN WE'RE PROPOSING THAT. COST OF DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH GETS UP TO THE TWO BILLION THAT I JUST MENTIONED. WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO. FURTHER ENHANCE SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE GET FROM THE COUNTIES AROUND ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS ISN'T AND RENEWALS AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THEM ON SOME DATA METRICS BECAUSE. BOTH ON THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN HOW COUNTIES HAVE CHANGED THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS WITH THE. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS AND WE WILL BE PROPOSING THEM. FOR MAY WHEN WE PUT THAT. BUDGET TOGETHER IN THE FALL AND IN THE WINTER THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM HAD NOT BEEN REAUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS AT THE TIME. THE CURRENT BUDGET HAD. CHOSEN A MIDDLE ROAD APPROACH WHICH WAS WE ASSUME THAT THE. PROGRAM WOULD BE REAUTHORIZED WE WERE NOT I'M THINKING THAT pEIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT MATCHING LEVEL AND SO WE WENT BACK DOWN TO THE SIXTY THE MORE TRADITIONAL SIXTY FIVE PERCENT MATCHING LEVEL AND THEN. CONGRESS DID FINALLY REAUTHORIZE THE PROGRAM BUT THEY. DID IT AT THE EIGHTY EIGHT SO THERE WILL BE AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE MAY REVISION I'M TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT THAT CHANGE WHICH WAS MADE TOO LATE FOR US TO. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE WERE DOING THE BUDGET. ANOTHER ITEM THAT I'M SURE WE WILL SPEAK OUT AT A FURTHER HEARING IS WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE THREE FORTY. BE DRUG. PROGRAM. THERE ARE SOME INCREASING CONCERNS BOTH AT A STAY AT A NATIONAL LEVEL AS TO HOW THIS PROGRAM IS. ADMINISTERED. BECAUSE THAT NATURE OF THE REBATES AND THOUGH WAY THAT THOSE DRUGS ARE PRICED AND DISCOUNTED IS THAT. WE HAVE. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THOSE REBATES ARE EITHER ACCOUNTED FOR NOT IN BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND IN MANAGED CARE AND SO WE HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THOSE DRUGS FOR PURPOSES OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY STILL BE ABLE TO BE USED IN DISPENSED FOR OTHER POPULATIONS BUT JUST NOT FOR MEDICAID. THERE ARE AND SMALLER CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CAP. WITH THE AND AS WE HELP SUPPORT AT THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY AROUND THE WHOLE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE. IN WHICH WE WOULD BE SEEKING TO. FUND ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AND THEN WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. A PROGRAM THAT WAS ENACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND. BOTH FROM A LENGTH OF TIME IN WHICH IT TOOK US TO GET IT APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IN WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC FREE SPENDING. NON HOSPITAL BASED CLINICS THERE WAS. ESSENTIALLY NO TAKERS FOR THIS PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO REPEAL THAT. FOR PURPOSES OF THE MEDI CAL ESTA MEANT. AS YOU HAVE NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA CASELOAD HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT. FOR A VARIETY OF. REASONS FOR WHICH WE WERE NOT QUITE I'M SURE BUT WE THINK THAT THE. VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT INCREASING ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA HAS CERTAINLY LED TO A SIGNIFICANT. TAPER IN FAMILY AND CHILDREN PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THOSE ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES BUT WE'RE STILL SEEN INCREASES IN THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION. AS WELL AS IN THE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CATEGORY. AND. THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF MAJOR POLICY CHANGES. WITHIN THE ESTIMATE. RELATES TOWARD DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAIVER SO JUST A QUICK REMINDER THIS IS A VOLUNTARY WAIVER THAT ARE COUNTIES ARE WORKING ON WITH US. TO IMPLEMENT A. CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IN THEIR COUNTIES FOR THEIR MEDICAL POPULATION AND. WE HAVE. TEN COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING WE ANTICIPATE ADDING AN ADDITIONAL TEN WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR AND WERE ESTIMATING THAT THERE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY. THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS THAT WILL BE. DRAWN DOWN AND USE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT SERVICES IN THESE COUNTIES. AND WITH FATS I WILL I STOP AND ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. TURN IT OVER TO MISTER CHAIR. WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE IN THE STAFF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT BEFORE WE HAD. DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN LA ILLITERACY I'M GONNA DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU KARLUK ASSAIL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ON YOUR AGENDA PROVIDES A NICE HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY STYLE FIGHT A FEW MORE POINTS TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT. AND THEN WALK YOU THROUGH THE CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS. AS DETAILED ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. SO PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE EXTENDED THE HIGHER. TAX RATES FOR PERSONAL INCOME TAX. OF THOSE WERE ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZED IN PROPOSITION THIRTY. THESE REVENUES ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT. THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT OFFSETS EXPENDITURES FOR EDUCATION AS WELL AS HEALTH HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND. PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE LIMITED THAT CALCULATION TO APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION OF THE EPA DOLLARS. SO TO LOOK AT THE REPORT CALCULATION ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR GENDER. THE FIRST LINE SHOWS YOU ARE REVENUES WITHOUT PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE. SO IF YOU WERE CURIOUS BUT THE AMOUNT OF THE PROPOSITION FIVE ADDITIONAL REVENUES ARE THAT IS ON YOUR. ON THE WORKSHEET ONLINE FOR. AND THE REASON YOU HAVE A LOWER AMOUNT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS BECAUSE PROPOSITION THIRTY WENT THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT FISCAL YEAR. HAS THE ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS. THE REVENUES TOGETHER ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY WE DO OUR PROJECT ESTIMATES. SO FOR EXAMPLE ARE MULTI YOUR REVIEW. THOSE REVENUE DOLLARS ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TRANSFERS AND SO. THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT TRANSFERS THE REQUIRED AS WELL AS ANY SUBLIMINAL DEPOSITS WOULD BE PART OF THAT CALCULATION. SO THAT WILL BE A POINT OF CONTENTION LATER AND SO I'M GONNA HOLD THE COMMENT BUT PUT A MARKER THERE IF YOU CAN ABOUT. WHAT WE ARE FORCED AND OBLIGATED TO DO AND WHAT WE CHOOSE TO DO VOLUNTARILY? IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE NEXT LINE IS A LITTLE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS THAT IS THEM THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL CALCULATION SO. I THINK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL ALSO CLARIFY WHETHER IT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES A DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN THE CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM THIS CALCULATION LOOKS AT WHAT THAT FORMULA WOULD BE. FOR THE NINE NINETY WORKLOAD OF. A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE LOOKED AT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS SO MOST OF THE BUDGET IS DEVELOPED. HELLO A CASELOAD ESTIMATES REQUIRED ESTIMATES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ESTIMATE FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS CONSIDER CURRENT CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED SERVICES. AND THEN AS YOU SEE THE COMPARISON OF LINE FOR WITH FLYING. I ONLINE FIVE WE SHOW THAT THE REVENUES ABSENT PROP FIFTY FIVE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE WORKLOAD ESTIMATE. SO. ASSUMING ALL OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS THERE WOULD STILL BE ABOUT ONE POINT NINE BILLION IN NEED. AND SO FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT ASSUME. ANY P. DOLLARS GOING TO MEDI CAL FUNDING. OF ONE CAVEAT I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IS THE MULTI YEAR LOOK HERE IS ASSUMING THAT. BUDGET AS PROPOSED SO ANY CHANGES IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WOULD AFFECT THOSE ARE YOURS. SO I'M GONNA ONE HERE FROM LA JOH BUT WANTED TO ALSO UNDERSTAND IS THIS FOR THE JANUARY BUDGET PRETTY MAY REVISE AND IS THERE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY REVISED. RE EVALUATE SOME OF THE CALCULATION. THIS WILL BE UPDATED AGAIN AMERICA SHOULD AND WILL BE UPDATED AGAIN OUT BUDGET ACT AND SO ON IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ON THE BUDGET TAPE THING I CANNOT POINT TO HEAR FROM AYE LEO AYE THROUGH. YOU HAD A VERY GOOD. PRESENTATION AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THAT STEMS FURTHER CONVERSATION. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS AND HOLLINGS HAD FINALLY JUST LET OF ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I JUST BE SPEAKING. BRIEFLY FROM A REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE ISSUED A FEW DAYS AGO ON THE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE ESTIMATES BY THE ADMINISTRATION. LET ME JUST. US TO GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL. CONTEXT FOR MY REMARKS A MINUTE. HOPEFULLY PUT A LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THE NUMBERS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST GAVE YOU WALK THROUGH HALL THE CALCULATION WORKS UP FROM THE MEASURES PERSPECTIVE. AND NOT GIVE YOUR OFFICES TWO COMMENTS. ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S IMPLEMENTATION SO JUST TURNING TO FIGURE ONE ON THE FIRST PAGE THIS OUTLINES I IN GENERAL HOW THE MEASURE SAYS THAT THE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE POPULATION SHOULD WORK. SO IT DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO BEGIN WITH AN ESTIMATE OF AVAILABLE GENERAL FUND REVENUES AS HAS JUST BEEN NOTED. THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF BOTH THE OPTIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL BSA DEPOSITS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S LA CALCULATIONS. THEN. WE SUBTRACT FROM THAT AS IT ADMINISTRATION NOTED THE MINIMUM FUNDING GUARANTEE AND THEN WE SUBTRACT FROM THAT THE WORKLOAD BUDGET. NOW THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A STRAIGHTFORWARD EXPLANATION HERE FOR WHAT THE WORKLOAD BUDGET IS BUT AS IT IS DESCRIBED IN THE MEASURE. IT IS THE BUDGET YOUR COST IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OF PROVIDING SERVICES THAT WERE AUTHORIZED ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO IN THE MEASURE SPECIFICALLY OTHER DEPARTMENT FINANCES TO TAKE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET AND THEN UPDATED FOR A VARIETY OF CHANGES INCLUDING CASELOAD PRICE INCREASES. AS WELL AS CHANGES THAT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S CONTROL LIKE FEDERAL IN COURT MANDATES. SO. AS A DEPARTMENT FINANCES NOTED. THERE'S A DEFICIT IN THEIR WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION WE JUST SHOW A SIMPLE SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF FAT I'M AT THE TOP OF PAGE TWO. THERE ARE. IN OUR ESTIMATE TWO REASONS. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IDENTIFIES A DEFICIT IN ITS WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION THE FIRST IS RELATED TO THAT AVAILABLE REVENUES PIECE. AND THE SECOND IS RELATED TO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION. AS WAS NOTED ON AVAILABLE REVENUES. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL DEPOSITS SHOULD BE COUNTED SORT OF IN THE NORMAL BUDGETARY SONS AS A NEGATIVE A NEGATIVE TRANSFER FROM AVAILABLE REVENUES. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THE OPTIONAL DEPOSIT INTO THE BSA SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED THIS WAY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES I'M INTERPRETATION ABOUT ESTIMATE AS A RESULT WOULD SLIGHTLY INCREASE ARTS I WOULD SLIGHTLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE REVENUES AND THEREFOREI REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SURPLUS AVAILABLE FOR MEDI CAL. SO. OUR SECOND COMMENT IS REGARDING THE WORKLOAD BUDGET CALCULATION. BICU. THE REPORT OF FINANCE TAKES A VERY BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THE PHRASE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED SERVICES. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT THE INTER. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE COUNTS ANY SERVICE THAT WAS IN PLACE ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN. OF ANY GENERAL TYPE AS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZE EVEN IF A SPECIFIC BENEFIT OR PROGRAMMER SERVICE WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME. SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE BRIDGE PROGRAM OF THIS PROVIDED A MEDIA CHILDCARE ACCESS TO FOSTER FAMILIES ON FOSTER PARENTS. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION COUNTS THAT AS PART OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET UNDER THE RATIONALE THAT THE STATE HAS LONG PROVIDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT FOR FOSTER FAMILIES. THAT SAID THE THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO AS YOU CAN SEE ON BOTH OF THESE DECISIONS WOULD TEND TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MEDI CAL. SURPLUS AVAILABLE UNDER THE MEASURE UP PERHAPS BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. WITH THAT IT SEEMS TO GIVE A COMMENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO WHAT I WAS JUST WILL INTO A FOR THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FOR THE BSA DEPOSIT AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR PART IN THE ADDITIONAL. WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THERE WAS THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT. GOT WAS ALSO TREATED THE SAME WAY IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR REVENUES FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR. ON AND THEN ANOTHER IT CLARIFICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE IS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS. THERE'S NO TRUE UP FOR THIS DETERMINATION SO THAT THE TERMINATION OF BUDGET ACT WILL BE THE FINAL EVEN THOUGH I A NUMBER OF FACTORS WILL STILL BE CHANGING AFTER THAT. AND IT IN THAT VEIN THAT OUR CONCERN AS THE LEGISLATURE IS COMING FORWARD TODAY WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE SET A PROCESS THAT WILL BECOME PRESIDENT. GOING FORWARD AND SO LOOKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE CREATING IT TOGETHER. MIRRORING WHAT VOTER INTENT WAS IN PASSING THIS LEGISLATION. AND I HAVE CONCERNS GLOBALLY IF I MAY JUST SPEAK PLAINLY THAT WHEN WE HAVE SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF. SURPLUS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN A BUDGETARY DEFICIT AND UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY INCREASE OF FUNDS TO MEDI CAL DOES NOT SEEM TO BE. AT ITS FACE VALUE. WHAT THE VOTERS HAD INTENDED TO DO? SO I WOULD LIKE TO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR QUESTIONS BUT FIRST WE'RE GONNA GET PUBLIC COMMENT TO. ON ISSUE ONE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BEARS I MEAN THOUSANDS OF HEALTH ACCESS WE ARE THE STATEWIDE CONSUMER HEALTH ADVOCACY COALITION. ADVOCATING FOR QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE AND SHARE THE LA LA WAS CONCERNED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROP FIFTY FIVE CALCULATIONS. WILL RESULT IN MEDI CAL RECEIVING NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE THIS YEAR'S CALCULATION WILL SET A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE YEARS AS I'M THE CHAIR MENTIONED THE LEGISLATURE MUST LOOK CAREFULLY. AT THE CALCULATIONS BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM MEDICAID I'LL ARE AT STAKE. HEALTH ACCESS REQUESTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE ACT CONSISTENTLY WITH THE WILL OF THE VOTERS TO YOU STATE REVENUES TO APPROPRIATELY FULFILL PROP FIFTY FIVE MEDI CAL FUNDING. ON CHIP YOU KNOW WE ARE GLAD CONGRESS REAUTHORIZED CHIP AT A HIGHER RATE OF OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT FEDERAL MATCH AND WE REQUESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE USE. THOSE NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN SAVINGS IN THE CHIP PROGRAM AT THREE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TO IMPROVE THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. BY RESTORING BENEFITS OR PROVIDING MORE PEOPLE WITH HEALTH COVERAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JANICE CAN DOWN CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND REPRESENTING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT THE RECENT FEDERAL ACTION TO EXTEND CHILDREN'S OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM FUNDING FOR TEN YEARS WILL HAVE ON THAT. CALIFORNIA'S. MEDICARE BUDGET AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION WAS NOT ASSUMED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. AND IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THE. THAT. THOSE SAY OF CHIP FUNDS WILL BE DEDICATED TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ON A HOUSE ABOUT WITH UNITED RAISE THE CALIFORNIA I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND JUST. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF THE ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN CHIPS SAVED DOLLARS. IS SOMETHING THAT. IS FOCUSED ON. CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AND ENSURING THAT THOSE DOLLARS GO TO OF THOSE THAT NEED THEM THE MOST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MARY MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND JUST WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT AND SUPPORT ITS PROPOSAL TO INCREASE HOME NURSING RATES. A WE HAD A LOT OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE WHERE THERE WERE NO PEDIATRIC HOME NURSES AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN. A BECAUSE THE REACHES COULD NOT SUPPORT THE SUPPORT THE LEVEL OF NURSING THAT THOSE KIDS ON VENTILATORS AND I MEAN I. INFUSION SYSTEMS NEEDED AND SO WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT ON THE WORK ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS PAID OFF AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT THINKING. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE A BRING IT TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WHEN I HAVE SOME. I WANTED TO HEAR AGAIN HOW THE OPTIONAL THREE POINT FIVE BILLION. THAT WE'RE PLACING. INTO THE BSA. IS NOT A DECISION. THAT WE ARE MAKING TO THEN CREATE THE APPEARANCE THAT WERE IN A BUDGET DEFICIT. I'D WANT TO GET INTO THE SPECIFICS TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT'S. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS. ASSUMING THAT THAT'S THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE SO OF THAT AS WE TO SOME XIN JUST OFF. THE BAT HOW CAN WE BUDGET FOR THAT. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT TO BE ADDED TO THE REQUIRED DEPOSIT. THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE CALCULATION AND AGAIN THIS WAS MORE OF A CONSISTENCY OF HOW THE REVENUES ARE DETERMINED AND TREATED IN VARIOUS CALCULATIONS FOR THE BUDGET. TYPE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT PORTION OF IT THEN HOUSE JUST MAKING IT CONSISTENT WITH THE REMAIN. AND THE REVENUES THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE REVENUES. INCLUDES THE REVENUES IN TRANSFERS SO AT WHATEVER LEVEL THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO DO ABOVE THE REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE PART OF THIS CALCULATION AND YET YOU HAVE. PUT UP PLACE MARKER IN THERE THAT THEN PROHIBITS FUND'S THAT SHOULD BE GOING IN. THE VOTERS MIND TOWARDS MEDI CAL. HOW HAVE YOU MADE THAT DETERMINATION AND WHY ARE WE THEN IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE FUNDS? TO HELP. THE PROGRAMS THAT NEED. THE MOST IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WERE LOOKING TO SET ASIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR. THAT THE POTENTIAL DOWNTURN WHERE WE NOTED THAT THE. AS AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE WOULD BE. AT THE SAME. EXTENDED THE ORB THE LENGTHIEST. OF RECOVERY PERIOD IN THE ITS POST WORLD WAR HISTORY SO PART OF THE PROPOSAL WAS MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH CERTIFIED IN RESERVES NO I'M NOT A. I THINK OUR STRUGGLE IS YOUR BUDGET CALCULATION. IT IS THAT BY TAKING IT AS A TRANSFER BY CREATING A NEGATIVE BALANCE. YOUR CREATING A GIMMICK. IN BUDGET PARLANCE THAT ACTUALLY. IS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY FOR US TO HAVE A REAL SURPLUS AND TO REPRESENT THE VOTER'S INTENT TIGHT STRUGGLE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THIS WAS WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED ON. LAST FOR US. CREATE SPREADSHEETS THAT TOOK AWAY THEIR INTENT. I'LL TRADE AND OF A DIFFERENT WAY OF IT BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. THE CLARIFICATION IS MORE OF WHAT THE INTENT DOES AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH AND SO AS OF JUNE. BY JUNE THIRTIETH IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS CHOSEN TO DO A SUPPLEMENTAL SO OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDED THAT ASSUMPTION. WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES IT WOULD BE AS OF THE JUNE THIRTIETH SO IT'S MORE OF A. THE PROPOSAL IS TO INCLUDE THAT WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH THAT WOULD BE THAT ESTIMATE. YEAH I'M. WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN. EQUIVOCAL TO. NOT HAVE SUBTRACTED IT IN THE NEGATIVE WAY THAT THE LA O. HAS RECOMMENDED. AS A FASHION FOR US TO GET AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF WHAT. SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN. CLUE DID TO REPRESENT THE VOTER'S INTENT AGAIN I'M STRUGGLING TO. FEEL AS IF THIS IS A ONE SIDED CONVERSATION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ULTIMATELY HAS. QUITE AN ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS WITHIN OUR WORKLOAD BUDGET. BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRECEDENT THAT'S BEING SET ABOUT OPTIONAL PAYMENTS OUTSIDE OF WHAT WAS MANDATED BY PROPOSITION TWO. AND I'M WONDERING HOW WE DECIDED UPON THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION HOW WE. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE FAIR IS IF WE WANTED TO FILL UP THE PIGGY BANK AND CREATES THE OPTIC. AND YET IS THAT WHAT VOTERS INTENDED FOR US TO DO. OR WHEN WE HAVE SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SURPLUS THAT WILL ACTUALLY INVESTED INTO MEDI CAL AS INTENDED BY THE VOTERS. IT SEEMS AS IF WE ARE. CREATING. THIS BUDGET. DEFICIT ON PAPER. SO AS TO NOT FUND MEDI CAL CAN WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. READING OF THIS PROPOSITION AND AS IT SETTING PRECEDENTS GOING FORWARD. AND WE WERE LOOKING AT MORE OF THE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE DOCUMENT SO ACROSS MULTIPLE CALCULATIONS. SO. IF MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS ASSUME TRANSFERS IN THE REVENUE NUMBER IT'S THE SAME FORECAST HERE THE REVENUE NUMBERS ASSUME THAT TRANSFER. BUT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WAS MANDATED AT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. TO GO AND. WHY ARE WE NOT DOING AND BEING CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION TWO TO PLACE THE MINIMUM TRANSFER AMOUNT TEN WHY DO WE INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL? OPTIONAL INCREASES ABOVE. WHAT? IS HAPPENING IN PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR US TO BE CONSISTANT SHOULDN'T WE MIRROR WHAT WE'RE DOING AND PROP NINETY EIGHT AS WE SHOULD DO AND PROP TWO. I I THINK IT'S AN ORDER OF EVENTS THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING BUT. WHEN WE'RE DOING THE PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE THAT DODD GENERAL FUND REVENUE NUMBER ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT TRANSFERS OVERALL. THESE TO BE INCLUDED IN THEIR EYES AS THE THE EPA DOLLARS. IN GENERAL BUT THEIR PROPERTY FIVE IS THE LAST CALCULATION AND IT LOOKS AT WHAT THAT FINAL. PACKAGES. I AM STILL. I'M NOT FEELING LIKE. I'M UNDERSTANDING HOW WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION. DAHLE ARE OPTIONAL PAYMENT TO TAKE IT OFF THE TOP AND NOT INCLUDE IT INTO THIS PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE ESTIMATES AND REALLY WOULD LIKE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. WHERE THAT STATUTORY AUTHORITY CAME FROM? AND HOW. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. SO THEY AUTHORITY WILL COME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES A SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT SO THE REQUIRED AMOUNT YOU CRACKED IS. HOWEVER THE CONSTITUTION CURRENTLY PROVIDES THAT. WHEN OUR SUCTION WAS THAT THIS WOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE'S UP OF. RECOMMENDATION AND THE AMOUNT YOU'RE CORRECT WAS DETERMINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD GET US TO THE TEN PERCENT CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET AND I SEE THE REAL BENEFIT OF DOING WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING. BUT IN TERMS OF US MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING INAPPROPRIATE PRECEDENT I WANT THE CALCULATION THE PROCESS CORRECT. AND I'M STRUGGLING TO FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE RIGHT PROCESS. WHEN IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES BEFORE THE JUNE BUDGET IN SO. I'M ACTUALLY WONDERING IF THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS IS TO SET WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TODAY TO DO WHAT THE MINIMUM IS WITH AND PROPOSITION TWO IN TERMS OF CREATING OUR BUDGET. AND THEN TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO COME JUNE THIRTIETH TO ENSURE THAT WERE PREPARING FOR TOMORROW. I'M JUST FEELING AS IF. WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS PRESENTING IS A WAY FOR US NOT THAT? TRULY REFLECT VOTER INTENT AND I'M TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND FROM YOU WHY WE. ARE IN THIS POSITION TODAY WHO AM I I THINK THAT WE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING THAT WE WILL END UP WE WILL UPDATE THIS AT BUDGET ACT WITH WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE'S. APPROVED AMOUNTS ARE SO THIS WAS JUST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ASSUMING THAT THAT ADDITIONAL. REVENUE TO ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT WAS MADE IT TO BE A THING WHICH CONSISTENT WITH OTHER. TRACKING OF REVENUES AND TRANSFERS WOULD BE REDUCED FROM THAT AMOUNT. THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING IS WHY WOULD WE APPROVE IT IF YOU'RE NOT EXPLAINING IT. TO LOOK WHY WOULD BE AND WE BE ENCOURAGED TO VOTE FOR THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON IT BUT IF IT'S NOT CLEAR NOW. THEN I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT I THINK THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE DISCONNECT IS IS YOU'RE SAYING ASSUMING THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVES THAT BY. YOU NOT GIVING ME INFORMATION IN ORDER TO APPROVE IT AND SO. I'M UNDERSTANDING EITHER. THEY ARE SEPARATE DETERMINATION SOAP THE WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES AS A SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO ONE. THAT WOULD BE IT. BUILT INTO THE REVENUES FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS BUT THEN FOR THIS CALCULATION WOULD BE AT THE FINAL WHATEVER THAT AMOUNTS IT'S. IT COULD BE IT GOING PLEASE. I THINK NOT ONLY SUPPOSE A VERY CLEARLY. YOU'RE PRESENTING AN ASSUMED. AMOUNT WITHOUT PRESENTING THE FULL AMOUNT SO ALL OF YOUR CALCULATIONS THE YOU'RE PRESENTING TO US TODAY. IT USING A ENDING THIS IS THE BEST DOUBLE SPEAK OF EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. IT YOU'RE SHOWING US BASED UPON AN ASSUMPTION. THAT IT SHORT CHANGED INSTEAD OF THE FULL AMOUNTS. THE IS IS WHAT IT WHAT I'M TAKEN FROM AND I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE APPEAR ON THE DICE IS TAKEN FROM A MAN. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US. TO TAKE YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT WILL DECIDE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T PRESENTED WITH THE FULL AMOUNTS. AND AND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO MAKE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT AND THEN ALL THE CALCULATIONS WOULD CONSISTENTLY REPRESENT THAT TRANSFER IN THAT ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SO I THINK. THAT THERE'S A CHOICE YOU COULD MAKE AS WELL TO NOT CREATE A NET NEGATIVE TRANSFER. YOU COULD CHOOSE TO MAKE THIS AS AN OPTIONAL PAYMENT. ON PAPER. AS THE LA OBRA FLEX THAT WOULD RESULT IN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INCREASE IN TO MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT AND SO I QUESTION YOU AGAIN. WHY DID WE DECIDE TO DO THIS AS A NET NEGATIVE TRANSFER AND IS THERE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REEVALUATE THAT PRECEDENT SETTING DECISION? HOW DID WE COME TO THAT DECISION AND? HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS THE BEST PROCESS WE HAVE? IT. THE DETERMINATION TO FILL THE THE RAINY DAY FUND. TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM WAS SEPARATE AND ASSUMING THAT THAT WAS THE ADOPTION IT THEN BY JUNE THIRTIETH THAT WOULD BE LESS REVENUE AVAILABLE WHICH WAS HOW WE CAME UP WITH. THE CALCULATION FOR WHEN YOU'RE DETERMINING HOW MUCH REVENUE IS AVAILABLE FOR PROP FIFTY FIVE PURPOSES. AND FOR TAKING MONEY FROM THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT. IT WAS MORE OF A COMPARISON OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH AND SO. CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF THAT REVENUE WAS AS OF THAT POINT OF TIME IS WHY WE SUBTRACTED IT HERE. LET ME SWITCH TO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET JUST SO THAT WE MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. CONTINUE TO PONDER WHAT HE JUST SAID. THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT AN OPTIONAL SPENDING HAVE ALL BEEN. INCLUDED INTO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET. AND. I AM WANTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT IN WAS ALREADY INCLUDED AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF. AGAIN WORK CREATING ON PAPER A SITUATION WHERE WE WILL HAVE ZERO DOLLARS TO SPEND ON MEDICAL WHEN WE HAVE SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION IN SURPLUS. AND I'M QUESTIONING IF FOR OF RESPECTING VOTERS CONTENT. BY CREATING A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE NOT. IT IT SEEMS AS IF IT BOTH DOUBLE SPEAK AND AND FRANKLY IT'S COOKING THE BOOKS A BIT. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY. WE'VE MADE THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS THERE A WAY TO WHAT EXTENT AND WHY WE HAVE DONE. UP I I THINK VILLAGE CIVILES DID A GREAT JOB OF KIND OF DESCRIBING WHAT WAS THE DIFFICULTY IN DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE WERE TAKING A BROAD APPROACH TO THE DEFINITION AND IT IS THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S CONSIDERED WORKLOAD. THERE WAS A SMALL PORTION THAT WE LOOKED AT THE END AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS THE PROXIMATE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION. THAT WE DIDN'T CONSIDER PART OF CURRENTLY AUTHOR I SERVICES. BUT FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT IT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROJECT OR TRACK THOSE ONGOING. A WE WERE LOOKING FOR PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO THIS DETERMINATION. AND I CAN APPRECIATE I DID LIKE THE LA DOES. WRITING UP OF IT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO. WORK FORWARD IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONSTANTLY COME BACK TO JANUARY FIRST BUT. WOULD HAVE. AND AM LOOKING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO WORK WITH THIS LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING. OUR. STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE. AND FRANKLY DON'T FEEL THAT WE'VE DONE TO THAT POINT YET I THINK MANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. I FIND A TROUBLING AT BEST. I I FIND THAT THE DECISION TO EXCLUDE THAT OPTIONAL THREE AND A HALF BILLION WILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AWAY. FROM NETWORKS THAT WE WILL HEAR LATER TODAY THAT NEED HELP. AND I WONDER WHY WE HAVE MADE THAT DECISION. TO. BUT IT DOES NOT HERE THAT I DO NOT HEAR. BETTER ANSWERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT WILL HELP US TO DRIVE FOR THAT. SO AT THIS POINT WILL LOOK TO OUR COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO IT. WHAT FOR ME I'M REALLY NOT UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING I I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST ME MISUNDERSTANDING BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S MATCHING WITH? AND WHAT WE'RE NOT GIVING CLEAR ANSWERS I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT I KNOW MAYBE I NEED A CHART OR SOMETHING TO SHOW ME SPECIFICALLY WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE MONEY IT'S JUST. WE'RE GOING I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND WE'RE NOT GETTING THE ANSWER AND THAT'S WHERE THE FRUSTRATION COMES ANDERSON AS WE GET FRUSTRATED YOU GONNA START HEARING CURING MORE. IT'S SO IF YOU CAN SPEAK AND. NON. NON ACCOUNTING LANGUAGE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER BECAUSE I'M STILL COMPLETELY LOST AS TO WHY WE HAVE A DEFICIT I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE BOTTOM LINE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND SO I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING ELSE BUT WHY DO WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE. I THINK SAID THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION THERE IS THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS AND IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE DISPLAYS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT THE CUSTOMER THAT CONFUSION. OF. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MULTI YEAR DISPLAY YOU'LL SEE. THIS HUGE CARRYING BALANCE AND THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THERE'S A. ALONG A HUGE RESOURCE BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE CALCULATION FOR. PROP FIFTY FIVE SO I THINK PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE DISPLAYS. BUT THEY ARE REPRESENTING DIFFERENT THINGS. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO UP TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO YOUR STAFF AT THAT WOULD. WHAT WOULD HELP TO? UNDERSTAND THE CHART WELL IT'S YES BUT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS THIS HEARING IS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO UNDERSTAND I JUST ME GET MY PRIVATE. YOU KNOW EXPLANATION SO I APPRECIATE AND I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON IT BUT IS THERE A MORE CONCISE WAY SO WE CAN SAID SO THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HUNDRED THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THESE HEARINGS THAT THAT WERE. YOU KNOW MAKING THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING ALL OF THESE AND IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I'M NOT YOU KNOW. IN THE BUSINESS BUT I'D I FOR CONFUSED I THINK MOST OF OUR AUDIENCE IS CONFUSED AS WELL AND SO. I APPRECIATE OUT TAKE YOU UP ON IT BUT IF THERE ARE A OF MORE CONCISE WAY OR MORE CLEAR WAY OF EXPLAINING IT SO THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS AND NOT JUST ME AND MY STAFF. I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASIER WAY I'M THINK I'M I'M PICTURING ARE ARE MULTI YOUR DISPLAY THAT HAS THE SAME REVENUES BUT IT DISPLAYS THEM DIFFERENTLY AND THE DEFICIT THAT YOU SEE. OR THE SURPLUS THAT YOU SEE WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND. THE PROPERTY FIVE CHART WILL SHOW PIECES OF THE SAME INFORMATION AND SO YOU YOU DON'T SEE THE SAME THING ACROSS. WELL WHY WOULD THIS NOT SET A PRECEDENT THOUGH BEYOND THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS COULD MAKE. SIMILAR OPTIONAL DEPOSITS INTO FUNDS WHY IS THIS NOT PRECEDENT SETTING. FOR EVERY. ADMINISTRATION TO WANT TO. SEEMINGLY TAKE FUNDS AWAY FROM MEDI CAL. THIS SEEMS AS IF IT'S A INDEPENDENT DECISION MADE FROM ONE BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE CONTRARY TO WHAT VOTERS INTENDED TO BY SENDING US THIS MONEY. AND I'D LIKE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AGAIN. WHAT WHY IS IT THAT WERE HERE TODAY AND? IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK FORWARD COLLABORATIVELY TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE. LISTENING TO VOTERS WHO SENT US. THEY ARE FUNDS IN THE FIRST PLACE. I I WILL TAKE BACK THESE CONCERNS ALUM. A I EIGHT THINK AGAIN TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WAS TO IF A SEPARATE DECISION TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT BUT THEN. THE REVENUE DISPLAY IS CONSISTENT ACROSS. THE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS I WILL TAKE BACK YOUR CONCERNS. SEEING. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES I THINK AT THIS TIME WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND LOOK FORWARD TO PURSUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE GO FORWARD. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO LARA I LA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING AS DOCTOR CAN'T EXPLAIN EARLIER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF FIFTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION TOTAL FUNDS EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRICE INDEX PROJECTION AT THE TIME OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DEVELOPMENT. THE NEW ALLOCATION COMBINES THE PREVIOUS ONE POINT THREE. AT BILLION DOLLAR BASS AND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION A CA AUGMENTATION AND THEN APPLY INCREASES IT ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CPI PROJECTION. WITH THIS INCREASE COUNTIES WILL WORK TO PLACE BENEFICIARIES IN THE CORRECT EIGHT CODES INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETED AND ACCURATE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND ANNUAL RE DETERMINATIONS. AND PROVIDE TIMELY ALLEGE BILLION ENROLLMENT DATA AND REPORTS TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SIMILAR INCREASE WILL BE APPLIED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SAID NEARLY MADONNA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE DO SUPPORT THE INCREASE THAT'S PROPOSE TODAY. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING. AND WERE IN SOME CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS THAT IT'S INTENDED TO BE AN ON GOING BASIS ON NOT JUST THE TWO YEARS THAT WAS NOTED IN THE. IN THE AGENDA. AND WILL LOOK TO CLARIFY THAT HOPEFULLY AT THE MAY REVISE WE DO THINK THE STATE MADE A REALLY GOOD EFFORT TO TRY TO SEEK A CONTRACTOR WE. ARE MORE ENGAGED UNDER CONFIDENTIALITY TO HELP WITH THINKING THROUGH WHAT WE WOULD WANT A CONTRACTOR TO DO. THEY MADE A GOOD EFFORT THE PERSON THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO HIRE WOULD NEED TO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. HOW WE HOW WE DO THAT WORK AND THE PERSON JUST WAS NOT FORTHCOMING THEY TRIED AND THEY YOU KNOW DID NOT FIND A CONTRACTOR WHO CAN HELP DEVELOP IN THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY? GIVEN THE LATE NATURE OF IT AND THE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THAT OFF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THEY PROPOSE THIS APPROACH TO REINSTITUTE A COST OF OF. DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENT ESSENTIALLY AND WE THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH. IT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE AS THINGS SETTLE DOWN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT WERE ABLE TO KIND OF COME BACK TO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE DO NEED TO REDO FROM SCRATCH THAT BUDGET METHODOLOGY BUT FOR NOW. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE DOING GOOD WORK WERE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE DO IN THE TWENTY THOUSAND PLUS ELIGIBILITY STAFF THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTIES. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE I JUST WANNA KNOW ONE THING THAT WERE STILL ALSO INTO SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON. IS A PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS RELATED TO THE ANNUAL REALLOCATION OF FUNDS FROM UNDER SPENDING COUNTIES TO OVERSPENDING COUNTIES. WE'RE TALKING A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS ON THE MARGIN HERE THIS HAPPENS AT THE CLOSE OUT IT'S A COUPLE OF YEARS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL IN NATURE. ON THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE ELIMINATING THAT WE THINK YOU CAN'T EVER QUITE GET A HUNDRED PERCENT ON THE NOSE WHICH COUNTIES TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME ADJUSTING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO WE'VE BEEN IN SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT WE HOPE TO GET RESOLVED BEFORE THE MAY REVISE. JUST WANTED TO PUT A NOTE IN IN CASE WE DO NEED TO COME BACK FOR FOR SOME REASON NOT ABLE TO FIT GET THAT OUT BUT WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO TO WORK THROUGH THAT. OTHERWISE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. BELOW IN THE COMMENTS ON INITIATIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL SEE WHAT THE LA SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME BUT ACTIVE DATA REPORTING AND. COMPLETION UMKHONTO TIMELY BASIS THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES AND AND AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE FUNDING. GRIP. BOB WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA. WE AS WELL ARE IN FAVOR OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT ARE BEING ALLOCATED AND TO THE COUNTIES FOR MEDI CAL ADMINISTRATION. I JUST WANNA ECHO WHAT THAT THE POINTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM C. WTA AND ALSO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SPECIAL OF A SPECIALIZED CONTRACTOR. WE TO AGREE THAT. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH I'M RECOGNIZING COST ISSUES AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE REALLOCATION OF FUNDS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S OPENNESS TO FIGURING OUT THE SOLUTION WITH US THANK YOU. YOU. MARY VALDEZ WHAT HEALTH ACCESS WE SUPPORT THE COUNTIES HAVING ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLING PEOPLE INTO MEDI CAL. WE ARE AWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND WE ALSO HOPE. THAT THIS AND I GUESS RESULT THANK YOU. IF YOU. WITH THAT I'LL BRING IT TO THE DIVESTMENT QUESTIONS WE HAVE. SO DO AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THESE ISSUES WITH COUNTIES AND IMPROVING THE SYSTEMS AND IN THIS KIND OF GOES TO THE LA US QUESTION. ARE WE GONNA BE USING SOME OF THE SPENDING. TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THOSE SYSTEMS TO HELP THOSE CASELOADS AND WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND AND FINALLY GET WITH THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LIKE WE'VE DISCUSSED. I DO HOPE SO I THINK AS YOU NOTE IN THE. IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE THINKING AS WE'RE MOVING TOWARD A SINGLE STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA TAKE A FEW YEARS AGO TO TAKE MORE THAN JUST TWO YEARS WHICH HENCE MY COMMENT ABOUT I THINK THIS IS KIND OF AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AROUND. ENSURING THAT WE GET THE COST INCREASES THAT WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR THE ACTUAL NEW SYSTEMS OF THE IN A SEPARATE BUDGET ITEM IT WOULDN'T BE HERE EMBEDDED IN THIS BUDGET ITEM. BUT WE ARE IN VERY CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL WORKING A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET THAT DONE. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING FOR A FEW MONTHS. ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF MONTHS TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE. ON OUR PROCESSING OF CASES THAT WERE PRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE'VE HAD CASES THAT WERE UNDER THE OLD RULES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE BROUGHT THE MEN UNDER THE NEW RULES WHICH IS A MORE EFFICIENT AND GENERAL. AND SO ON THAT SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS ON BEING DONE WITH THE STATE RIGHT NOW TO GENERATE LISTS FOR THE COUNTY SO WE CAN. WORK THROUGH THOSE AND GET THOSE OUT OF THE ONE EIGHT CODE IN INTO THE PROPER LONG GOING EIGHT CODE AND TRY TO GET THAT CLEARED OFF THE BOOKS SO I THINK BOTH FROM AN IT PERSPECTIVE. AND ALSO FROM SORT OF A MANAGING THE CASELOAD PERSPECTIVE WE'VE GOT. IRONS AND BOTH FIRES THERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK FINALLY. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE SO. FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SPECS. AS YOU KNOW. THERE WAS A NEGOTIATION. LAST YEAR BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AND HOW TO USE THOSE FUNDS ON THEY ARE STRUCTURED AS ONE YEAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. THERE WAS MONEY THAT WAS. DEDICATED FOR OUR HIV WAIVER AGENCIES THERE WAS. FUNDING FOR ICF DD'S THERE WAS A I'M SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES FOR. WOMEN'S HEALTH AND THEN THERE WAS PHYSICIAN AND A PENCIL RATE INCREASE THE ODDS I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND. CERTAINLY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THEY REQUIRE BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL SYSTEMS CHANGES TO OUR. COMPUTER SYSTEMS BUT THEY ALSO REQUIRE. APPROVALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN MOVING ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES ALONG THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS THE EASIEST TO DO WITH HIV. WAIVER AGENCY INCREASE THAT WAS A WAIVER AMENDMENT AND THAT WAS VERY QUICKLY DONE. THE ONES THAT HAVE TAKEN A LOT LONGER WORD THE DIRECTED PAYMENTS. FOR PHYSICIANS SERVICES AND DENTAL SERVICES BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING TO FLOW THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THROUGH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THAT ALSO COINCIDED AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE SEEKING NOT APPROVAL. IT COINCIDED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL MANAGED CARE ROLE IN WHICH WAS A NEW STRUCTURE ALTOGETHER AND SO WE JUST RECENTLY RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE DIRECTED PAYMENTS FOR THE PHYSICIAN RATES. THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ALL THAT BEING SAID IS THAT. EVERYTHING ALWAYS TAKES LONGER. EVEN WHEN WE'RE MOVING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. WE CERTAINLY. WILL BE FLOWING THOSE FUNDS BACK TO JULY FIRST AND SO EVEN THOUGH. DEPENDING ON WHO THE PHYSICIAN IS AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES WERE. ANYTHING THAT THEY PROVIDED AFTER JULY FIRST WILL HAVE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. PROVIDED TO THEM AND SO I THINK ON AN ONGOING BASIS WERE CERTAINLY. TRYING TO SMOOTH THE PATH ON IT. BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO SEEK NEW ANNUAL APPROVALS ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS EVEN IF NOTHING IS CHANGED WE WOULD HAVE TO GO AND GET THAT APPROVAL AND SO I THINK. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'LL TRY TO DO THAT IS TO ANTICIPATE AND OR BE TALKING TO OUR FEDERAL COLLEAGUES. I'M IN ADVANCE AND CERTAINLY THE MORE COMFORTABLE THEY ARE WITH DOING THESE PAYMENTS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY GET EASIER. THAT NEWEST ON PROPOSAL THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I'M USING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WHICH I SPOKE TO EARLIER. IS THAT FIFTY PERCENT. RATE INCREASE FOR THE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES IN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION AS WELL AS IN OUR WAIVER PROGRAMS. AND SO OVERALL GIVEN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT FUNDING AS I NOTED IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THESE. PARTICULAR CATEGORIES. WE ARE HOPING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAILED DATA. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION AROUND SOME OF THE UTILIZATION AND EARLY. ENCOUNTER DATA THAT WE ARE SEEN WITH THESE PROVIDERS IN THESE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE AND THEY'LL AND APPROVAL DELAY. WE ARE HOPING THAT THAT DATA WILL BE ENOUGH TO DEMONSTRATE. HOPEFULLY PROGRESS THAT AND TO ACHIEVE AS YOU ARE SO. GET IT SAYING YOU KNOW DID WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT THE VOTER SET OUT TO DO WITH THESE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PAYMENT SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF KEY. DATA INDICATORS WILL BE LOOKING AT ENCOUNTER DATA WHICH IS YOU KNOW DID ADDITIONAL SERVICES GET PROVIDED UNDER THE SPECIFIC SERVICES. WE WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING TO SAY DID ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS JOIN THE PROGRAM TO PARTICIPATE IN A MEDICAL PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF NOTABLE. BENCHMARK PIECES OF DATA THAT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU ON IN THE NAY REVISION. TO HEAR FROM THE REST OF THE PATH WE CAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA JOH WESTERN CENTER MISTER CHAIR WITH AN OPEN MIND BECAUSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE AGREEMENT LIKE I'M DIRECTOR CAN'T MENTION. IN BUT YOU WE ARE INCREASING PROVIDER PAYMENTS UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX. OF FUNDS. TOTAL FUNDS IS ABOUT TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO. AT. INCLUDING THE FEDERAL PIECE. ARI GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS UP EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS BASED ON THE PAYMENTS WILL GO OUT. INTO WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT BEFORE WE GOT DEEPER INTO THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PROPOSAL AND FOUND THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET AGREEMENT ON THE USE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF SAID THE PROPOSAL IS TO SPEND THE FULL ONE POINT THREE FOUR SIX BILLION DOLLARS ON PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES. AS. IN THE SERVICE IN PROVIDER CATEGORIES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE DEAL I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY AROUND THAT. GOING FORWARD BUT. DE THEIR PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIALLY CONSISTENT. WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AYE IS AVAILABLE TO FUND NEW PROVIDER PAID. PAYMENT INCREASES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THAT IS ATER THE PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES THAT WERE STRUCTURED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AGREEMENT ARE FULLY PAID FOR. A AND THIS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS REFLECTS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS ONE THAT REFLECTS THE PROPOSED INCREASE BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH UP PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING GOES TO PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES AND SECOND IT RECALL IT REFLECTS SOME ARE FREED UP FUNDING BECAUSE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS LOWERED THE ESTIMATED COSTS AT LEAST TO THE STATE OF THE PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES THAT WERE STRUCTURED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AGREEMENT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHILE IT DOES DEDICATE THIS FUNDING TO PROVIDE A PAYMENT INCREASES AYE IT DOESN'T HAVE A DETAILED. A SPENDING PLAN FOR WHERE TO ALLOCATE THIS FUNDING TOWARDS A SET OF SERVICES OR OR OR OR PROVIDERS IT GENERALLY WOULD ALLOCATE THEM AMONG THE. DENTIST IN PHYSICIAN CATEGORIES BUT BUT THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC SAY PROCEDURE CODES FOR WHICH THIS WOULD FUND AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. DID ADMINISTRATION BUT INTENTIONALLY LEFT THE DETAILS OUT UP TO BE WORKED OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN TERMS OF HOW THIS FUNDING WOULD ULTIMATELY BE ALLOCATED AND THIS REALLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE A TO PROVIDE INPUT AND HOW TO TARGET THE THESE RESOURCES. TO AND IMPROVE SERVICES AND AND ACCESS WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AYE IN LIGHT OF THE DOCUMENT AND ACCESS ISSUES WITH THE DAN ECHO PROGRAM WE DO SUPPORT THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO DANTICAT. PROVIDERS I IN PARTICULAR WE REQUEST THAT BASIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AT MAINTENANCE IS ALWAYS PREFERABLE TO HAVING TO RESTORE TEETH. AND IN ADDITION THEY MAKE THIS MAY SAVE THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IN THE LONG RUN. UP IN ADDITION TO ENSURE THAT COME TREATMENT THE RESTORATION OF GUM TREATMENT THAT. THAT I WAS RECENTLY AND INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. ARE. ACTUALLY UTILIZED WE REQUEST THAT BUT GUM TREATMENT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS A THERE'S A STRONG AND GROWING EVIDENCE THAT. THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COURT GUM HEALTH AND MEDICAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING HIGH DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE I'M THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION THERE. I IN ADDITION A WEEK WE DO SUPPORT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THAT THE HOME HEALTH UP. RATE AND AS I'M SURE OTHERS WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT SHORTLY THINKING. THANK YOU. HI AM JANICE CANAL AND I'M WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA AND I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION. WHICH ALSO INCLUDES CHILDREN NOW THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA COVERAGE AND HEALTH INITIATIVES. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF PREVENTIVE AND SPECIALTY SERVICES. LIKE THE VOTERS TO PASS PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THETARGETED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR MEDI CAL POSITION AND DENTAL SERVICES IN ORDER TO INCREASE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION. IN THE MEDI CAL AND TEND TO CALL PROGRAM AND INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR BENEFICIARIES. CHILDREN MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF ALL MEDI CAL ENROLLEES AND THEY HAVE UNIQUE HEALTH CARE NEEDS THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN AN ADULT MODEL OF CARE. AND THAT'S EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES LIKE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS CHILDREN'S UNIQUE HEALTH CARE NEEDS. RATHER THAN ASSUMING THERE ACCESS AND CARE IS CONGRESS. WITH ADULT MEDI CAL POPULATIONS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT LIST OF PHYSICIAN SERVICES ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REALIZE THE PROPERTIES SCHOOLS. FOR MOST CHILDREN AS MANY OF THE COATS ARE SKEWED TOWARDS EPISODIC CARE FOCUSED ON PROBLEM ORIENTED EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES. BUT CHILDREN SOMETIMES RECEIVE THIS TYPE OF EPISODIC CARE THE PREDOMINANT CARE FOR CHILDREN IS MORE ROUTINE DEVELOPMENTAL AND PREVENTION FOCUSED. IMPORTANT PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICE UNDER THE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT BENEFIT WERE LEFT OUT OF THE POTENTIAL ACCESS AND UTILIZATION ENHANCEMENTS. UNDER THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. THESE PREVENTIVE SERVICES INCLUDE WELL CHILD VISITS HEALTH SCREENINGS. IMMUNIZATION ADMINISTRATION. AND FLUORIDE VARNISH APPLICATION BY PHYSICIANS. ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE DATA MEDICAL PERFORMS BELOW THE NATION'S AVERAGE IN PROVIDING EPS DE T. SCREENINGS FOR CHILDREN. ONLY FORTY TWO PERCENT OF KIDS AND MEDI CAL WHO RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE INITIAL. OR PERIODIC SCREENING THAT THERE WERE THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COMPARED TO FIFTY PERCENT NATIONALLY ACCORDING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA. SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR THE STATE TO DIRECTLY INVESTING AUGMENTATIONS TO CHILDREN'S PREVENTATIVE HEALTH. WELL PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ALONE OF COURSE ARE NOT A PANACEA TO IMPROVING ACCESS AND UTILIZATION FOR CHILDREN. LEAVING THEM OUT COULD CAUSE MORE DISRUPTIONS AND EXACERBATE DISPARITIES. TO THAT END WE STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND D. H. YES TO CLOSELY CONSIDER HOW A PORTION OF THE ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION IN TOTAL NEW PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL PROVIDER PAYMENTS CAN BE USED FOR TARGETED INCREASES. IN PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES SO THAT CHILDREN AND MEDICARE CAN REALIZE THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SO SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR THEIR CARE. WE ALSO SUPPORT A STRINGENT EVALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT LOOKS AT HOW WELL THE PAYMENTS ARMENIAN PROP FIFTY SIX GOALS FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS ADULTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE AT THIS TIME. CAN REALLY CHECK OUT THE NETWORK WE WOULD WANT OURSELVES OF THE COMMENTS ARE. A COLLEAGUES AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY INSURE THAT PREVENTIVE SERVICES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS LONG WITH ALONG WITH COMPARTMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO ON A HOUSE ABOUT WITH YOU IN THE UNITED REYES A CALIFORNIA ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE AT CDF I'M ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S. HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION WE SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE TARGETED SUPPLEMENT PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAL PHYSICIANS AND DENTAL SERVICES HOWEVER THE CURRENT LIST OF PHYSICIANS SERVICES ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PAYMENTS ARE CENTERED ON THE EPISODIC CARE PRIMARILY AROUND. PROBLEM ORIENTED EVALUATION AND SERVICES THIS FOCUS. IS POTENTIALLY MISSING THE MORE ROUTINE DEVELOPMENTAL AND PREVENTION FOCUSED CARE WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF CARE FOR CHILDREN. CONSIDERING THE CHILDREN MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF MEDI CAL WITH FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION ENROLLEES IT'S IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THEIR UNIQUE HEALTH CARE NEEDS. AS WE INVEST IN SMART PROVIDER PAYMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MARY VALDEZ OF HEALTH ACCESS ON DENTAL. WE ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AT WESTERN CENTER AND URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE BASIC PREVENTIVE AND GUN TREATMENT DENTAL SERVICES ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. ON HOME HEALTH WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ACCESS IS A CHALLENGE. FOR SOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO RELY ON HOME HEALTH AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE UTILIZATION OF THE PROGRAM TO SEE HOW THESE PAYMENTS CAN BE BEST TARGETED. TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR THESE BENEFICIARIES. ON PROP FIFTY SIX. YOU KNOW HEALTH ACCESS WAS ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE HELPED DRAFT THE INITIATIVE AND ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNED FOR THE MEASURE. THE ELLIOT ESTIMATES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAKES FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION MORE AVAILABLE FOR RATE INCREASES THAN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND GOING FORWARD THESE INVESTMENTS IN ANY ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN PROVIDER RATES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD SPECIFIC PROVIDERS SERVICES GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIVE MEASURE MEASURABLE GAINS. IN PATIENTS ACCESS TO CARE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SO WE REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE. REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO EVALUATE WHETHER LAST YEAR'S RATE INCREASES A WERE THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. AND LASTLY YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO MAKING TARGETED PROVIDER RATE INCREASES WE REQUESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER USING THESE. ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO AUGMENT AND IMPROVE THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN OTHER WAYS SUCH AS EXPANDING COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS OR RESTORING THE REMAINING OPTIONAL MEDICAID BENEFITS THAT WERE CUT. DURING THE RECESSION THANK YOU. KATIE LADEN ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN SPECIALTY CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THEN PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUE. TOWARD SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PHYSICIAN AND DENTAL SERVICES AYE WE FEEL THESE PAYMENTS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ACCESS TO PEDIATRIC CARE AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO ALLOW AMPLE TIME FOR THE RATES TO TAKE EFFECT BEFORE CONDUCTING THEIR ANALYSIS. AND WERE ALSO HERE IN A VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE FIFTY PERCENT RATE INCREASE FOR HOME HEALTH SERVICES. THANK YOU. HUG THAT AFTERNOON BRING ACROSS HIM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FELL SERVICES AT HOME. WE'RE REALLY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PA HOME HEALTH FIFTY PERCENT RATE INCREASE. AMONG BE BRIEF RUNNING ALONG COMMITTEE BY REALLY JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN OUR HOURS AUTHORIZES AN HOUR'S RENDERED. WITHIN THIS TO REALLY HELP THAT MP MORE PROVIDERS INSTANTLY THINK VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HI SIMONE SHEKINAH WITH ALWAYS HOMEOWNERS SCENE AND WE PROVIDE. MEDI CAL HOME HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF ALL OUR PATIENTS THAT MEDI CAL PATIENTS SPECIFICALLY THAT AREN'T RECEIVING SERVICES. AS WELL AS THE NINETY CLIENTS WE HAVE ON OUR WAITING LISTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RATE INCREASE THANKS. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TERRY CALLIER HILL ON BEHALF OF ANY OP CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAKLAND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO. RAISE THE HOME HEALTH NURSING RATES BY FIFTY PERCENT WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS THAT ARE IN OUR HOSPITAL I'D THAT HAVE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS IN THEIR VERY COMPLEX OUGHT TO CARE FOR PATIENTS AS YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. AND WE WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING A PLACEMENT FOR THEM TO TO THE LOWER RATES SO THIS GOES A LONG WAY IN ENSURING THAT THOSE PATIENTS CAN BE SENT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES WHERE THEY NEED TO BE WHEN THEY'RE WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. I GOOD AFTERNOON BRANAGH PITTMAN SPONSOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET DOES INCLUDE ON THE FUNDING FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES AND TEN AND FOR DENNIS AND POSITIONS. AGREED TO IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND MORE. SO OUR MAIN ASK FOR YOU TODAY WOULD JUST BE STABILITY ADD THE WAY I THINK WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT THERE'S A SPA AND THAT WILL AND ON THE END OF JUNE. AND SO I THINK THE BEST WAY TO AND BE VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND MAKE SURE THESE RATES DON'T WORK IS TO HAVE THEM START AND STOP AND START AGAIN. EYES WE JUST REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO CONTINUE THESE SO WE DON'T HAVE DENNIS WHO ARE DOING WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO WHICH IS YOU KNOW TAKING MORE DENTICLE PATIENTS GETTING BACK INTO THE PROGRAM. WHO THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN CD'S RATES ARE OF STOP INCOME WONDER WHAT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE? WE DO AGREE THAT PREVENTION AND PERRY O. OUT DUMB DISEASE TREATMENT HOULD BE PRIORITIZE AS THE DEPARTMENT IS I'M. LOOKING AT WHERE TO SPENDTHESE DOLLARS NEXT AND WANT TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND THEN I THINK WE ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT UNDER SPENDING ON THE WE ARE AIMING TO HIT THOSE NUMBERS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EVALUATION I THINK WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THE RATES DIDN'T START AND YOU KNOW GETTING TO DENNIS AND TALKING ABOUT DECEMBER. AND AGAIN I THINK WITH THIS CONCERN ABOUT IF THEY'RE STARTING AND STOPPING AND HOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S REALLY GONNA TAKE TO MAKE. I'M A BIG INCREASE BECAUSE WE ARE ON VERY OPTIMISTIC THANK YOU THANK YOU. TURN MEMBERS KATHY MUST WORK ON BEHALF OF SIMPLY DISGRACEFUL NATION AS WILL THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NETWORK WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE. FOR INCLUDING IN CONTINUING TO INCLUDE THE RATES FOR ICF TO DIS AGES AND ENDS AS WELL AS THE HIV WAY FOR. AS AS ON THE DIRECTOR SAID EACH OF YOU WAVER HAS GONE INTO EFFECT WE ARE NOW JUST RECENTLY GETTING SUPPLEMENTAL RATES FOR THE ICF DD'S AND WE WOULD SAY BEFORE DOING ACCESS STUDY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME TIME. BUT OBVIOUSLY BEFORE THIS WE WERE SEEING A NUMBER OF FACILITIES LOOKING AT CLOSURE. AND ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE THE US THERE NOW BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN SO THINKING. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FUTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE GUYS FOR ANY QUESTIONS REMAIN. GETS JUST SOME CLARIFICATION PLEASE. ON HERE. IS THE UNDER SPENDING BECAUSE THE THE REIMBURSEMENTS DIDN'T START UNTIL DECEMBER. OF I HAVE YOUR THAT. THE ACCORDING TO THE BUDGET WE HAD A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS HEALTHCARE TREATMENT FUND. AND AND RIGHT NOW THE ESTIMATE IS THAT WOULD ONLY SPEND SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION IS THAT BECAUSE WE STARTLED DECEMBER. JUST I THINK IT'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THE DELAY IN THE TIMING. SOMEONE OF WHICH BEING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ON A CASH BUDGET. THERE WERE SEVERAL A TECHNICAL AYE DELAYS AND BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE THERE'S A BRAND NEW PROGRAM THE ARE CLAIMING PROCEED OUR PROCEDURES THE TECHNICAL UPGRADES HAVE YOU MADE ORDER TO PROCESS THE PAYMENTS. AS WELL AS WAITING FOR APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE PAYMENTS TO GO OUT BUT AS DIRECTOR KENT MENTIONED. THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JULY FIRST SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OF THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO GET. UP AND GOING IN PROCESSING THESE PAYMENTS I'M WE AND DO ANTICIPATE THAT ALL OF THE AYE PAYMENTS THAT HAVE COME IN SO FAR WILL BE RETROACTIVELY PROCESSED BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO AND THAT THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED BY THOSE IN THE AGENDA THAT IS OUR BEST. ESTIMATE FOR THE BEST FORECAST THAT WE HAVE AT THIS TIME WE WILL BE UPDATING THESE THAT MAY REVISION DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ACTUAL DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING. AND I IN ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS IS GONE SO FAR AS WE WILL HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION AS SOON AS THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE. ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH TO GET THIS BRAND NEW PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. WE JUST SAW THAT WE CAN GET SOME CLARIFICATION THE PROGRAM IS UP AND RUNNING AND IS WORKING FINE SO WE'RE NOT DAM NEXT YEAR SAY THAT IT. YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T DO THIS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WAS A MARKET. I'M NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. I THINK. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. JUST LIKE THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN THE MAY REVISE WITH THAT FULL FUNDING EXPENDITURE FOR THE. PREVENTIVE WITH THAT GALLON ALL THE DENTAL AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT FOR THE KIDS. SOMEONE TO SEE WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IN WITH THE PROJECTIONS. AND MAKE SURE THOSE MONIES GO THERE WHERE THEY NEEDED ME. CAN WE DESCRIBE THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT OF WORKING THROUGH HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE TOGETHER TO INSURE THAT THE SPENDING IS MATCHING. OUR MUTUAL PRIORITIES AND IF I CAN ECHO THE COMMENTS OF WANTING TO ENSURE PREVENTIVE. SPENDING. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROVIDER RATE INCREASES AS A MECHANISM FOR US TO SAVE MONEY TO THE SYSTEM OVERALL. SURE MAYBE I'LL I'LL START NOW LOOK TO FINANCE IN THE EARLIER TO. CHINA AND. SO EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PROVIDER CATEGORIES THAT ARE RECEIVING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING I'M WE DID IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY CORRECT SO HIV WAIVER AGENCIES GOT. A DIFFERENTIAL WHERE WE INCREASE THEM TO A CERTAIN LEVEL ICF DD'S WE DID A CERTAIN DIFFERENTIAL THAT GOT THEM UP TO THEIR YOU KNOW UPPER PAYMENT LIMIT WOMEN'S HEALTH FOR SPECIFIC SET OF CODES THEY RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT RATE INCREASE IN THOSE CODES. YOU KNOW RECEIVED A VERY SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THE PHYSICIAN CODES WE IDENTIFIED THIRTEEN IAN THEM CODES SO YOU WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH BILL IN ANY AND THEM CODE. AND WE ATTACHED IF IT DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO THOSE IN M. VISITS AND THERE WERE THREE PSYCHIATRIC VISITS ARE PSYCHIATRIC CODES THAT WE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED BECAUSE. PSYCHIATRY IN CHILD PSYCHIATRY ARE VERY MUCH. IN BOTH. SHORTAGE AND WE WANTED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER CODES WERE CHOSEN TO BE BROAD BASED AND TO ATTRACT POSITIONS OF ALL CAPACITY. WHEN WE TRIED VERY HARD BECAUSE AGAIN AS YOU HEAR SOME OF THE DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION IF WE GET TOO FANCY IT JUST MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED WHICH TAKES LONGER AND SO WHEN WE CHOSE THOSE POSITION CODES WE WERE TRYING TO DO IT. SO THAT WE HIT THE BROADER SWATH OF PHYSICIANS POSSIBLE. USING A STANDARD IN M. CODE AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GET. IN A VERY VERY SMALL CODES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOU KNOW CONSTITUENCIES BUT MAY NOT BE BROADER OR MAY NOT AND BE ABLE TO KIND OF. AND BE ESTIMATED SO I THINK THAT WAS OUR BEST SHOT AT THE TIME. WHEN WE WENT TO THE DENTAL CODES THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DENTAL CODES AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRY TO ATTACH A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT TO A SPECIFIC DENTAL CODE SO WE DID A FORTY PERCENT INCREASE. OVER CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DENTAL PROCEDURES SO. ENDODONTIC AND RESTORE IT IS AND WE DELIBERATELY DID NOT DO THE PREVENTIVE CATEGORY WITHIN THE DENTAL PROGRAM AND THERE WAS A REASON WHY. IS THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL. FUNDING PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY CALLED THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS UNDER OUR MEDI CAL WAIVER. WHICH IS A FIVE YEAR DEMONSTRATION. SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY GEARED ONLY TOWARDS CHILDREN AND SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARDS PREVENTIVE SERVICES. PURSUANT TO A LOT OF FEDERAL RULES WE CANNOT PAY. THIS FOR THE SAME THING TWICE AND SO WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT NOT WANTING TO MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED THAT WE WOULD TRIP OVER OURSELVES THAT IF WE DID A PREVENTIVE RATE INCREASE. AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAD D. T. I WOULD ACTUALLY NOT GET FEDERAL APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF DUPLICATING. A PAYMENT AND SO THAT WAS WHY WE DID IT THAT WAY. I THINK THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WANTING TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON AS THE DATA FOR EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT PROVIDER CATEGORIES COMES AND SO THAT WE CAN. BOTH TARGET THE RIGHT CODES I DON'T THINK THAT WE SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY THAT THE CODES THAT WE SAW. CHOSE WITH THOSE POSITION CODES WHERE THE ONLY BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE CHOSEN THEIR NOT THE. THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH BUT THEY MET OUR NEEDS I'M GIVEN THE SHORT TIMEFRAME GIVEN THE ONE YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT AND GIVEN OUR INTEREST IN. MAKING IT IS APPLICABLE TO AS MANY PHYSICIANS AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK. ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS AS SOON AS WE CAN PROVIDE THE DATA WITH SOME KIND OF OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS. WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SAY HERE'S WHAT WE'RE SEEN. HERE'S MAYBE WHAT WE CAN'T SAY YET WITH ANY KIND OF CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THIS. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WILL OR WON'T DO FOR PARTICIPATION. THERE MAY VERY WELL BE AN AGREEMENT. BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY LET'S JUST. STAY THE COURSE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND SEE IF ANOTHER YEAR OF DATA MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE OR THERE COULD BE A DECISION BASED ON THE DATA THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION SAY. YOU KNOW. THERE ISN'T NEW SET OF CODES THAT WE WANT YOU TO GO AND ATTACHED CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO AND WE WOULD WORK WITH AND. YOU KNOW OUR INTERNAL STAFF TO DEVELOP ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE THINK THAT COSTS AND THEN WE WOULD JUST KIND OF NEGOTIATED OUT BUT I THINK WHEN WE PUT THE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TOGETHER IN JANUARY WE HAD AN ABSENCE OF DATA. AND DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE WERE IN ANY BETTER POSITION TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAN THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND SO WE WE DO WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA TO MAKE THOSE. APPROXIMATIONS. WE'VE ASKED BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE MAY REVISION AS WE SPEAK AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR EARLY DATA AND I THINK IT'S IT'S PRETTY EARLY AND TO THE. POINT MADE BY FINANCE THE LAGS IN OUR CLAIM SYSTEM. SO WE CAN CATCH UP WITH WHAT WAS BILLED IN JULY RIGHT AND SO WE KNOW WHAT WAS BILLED IN WHAT RECEIVED A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. ON THE PHYSICIAN AND THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE DIRECTED PAYMENTS THOSE ARE SO NEW THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE. GREAT DATA BUT WILL BE CERTAINLY POLLING THAT FROM THE HEALTH PLANS. AND THEN. BECAUSE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE A YEAR TO SUBMIT CLAIMS THERE'S ALWAYS A CLAIMS LAG AND SO I WOULD SAY. ANYTHING THAT IS IT'S QUOTE GOOD DATA YOU USUALLY NEED SIX MONTHS AT LEAST IF NOT A YEAR TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT LIKE A GOOD. CAPTURE BUT I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING. AND GIVING AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND THAT MAY REVISION. HOME. WILL LOOK FOR THOSE DATA POINTS AS THEY COME BACK AND THAT WILL HELP US TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS I SEE WESTERN CENTER HAS A COMMENT THAT LIKE TO MAKE. IN IN REGARDS TO DUPLICATING PREVENTIVE SERVICES OUT WE RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNED THERE WOULD NOTE THAT THAT DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE IS SPECIFIC TO CHILDREN OF MISS CAN'T SAID. AS WELL AS THERE IS AT LEAST ONE ICD TEACH CODE THAT IS A PREVENTATIVE THAT SPECIFIC TO ADULTS AND SO THAT. I THAT CO DOES EXIST AND THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. QUICK. BUT I JUST TO CLARIFY SO SO THAT CAN BE INCLUDED. THAT THAT. CODE BECAUSE I'M. I GOT LOST IN THE CLOUDS PARTY SAID THAT THERE WAS THOUSANDS OF CODES ARE IN THE DENTAL IS THAT WHEN SEPARATE FROM THE QUOTES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO IS THAT INCLUDED IN THIS IT'S NOT CURRENTLY BUT THAT HER POINT IS IS THAT. WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE PREVENTIVE CATEGORY WITHIN THE DENTAL THERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF CODES AND WE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY AND HER POINT WAS IS THAT. THERE IS A SPECIFIC DENTAL CODE FOR ADULTS FOR PREVENTION THAT COULD BE INCLUDED SHOULD WE COLLECTIVELY DECIDE TO AND CRY AND WANT THAT THEN THAT'S MY QUESTION THOUGH BUT WHY WASN'T THAT INCLUDED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK WE JUST EXCLUDED THE I MEAN FIRST OFF WE PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME WHEN THE BUDGET WAS NEGOTIATED THEM PROP FIFTY SIX WAS DEVELOPED TO HAVE A. AN ITERATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF GOING OVER THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DENTAL CODE SO WE JUST EXCLUDED THAT CATEGORY BUT IF THERE IS A SINGLE CODE WE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT. NUMBER AND I WILL END BY ECHOING THE COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA COLLECTION I APPRECIATE THAT WHILE WE'VE HAD A LAG WE'RE GOING TO RETROACTIVELY PAY IT. BUT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAS WORK CONTINUING THIS PROGRAM THAT WE REALLY DO GIVE PROVIDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE THE BENEFIT OF TAKING CARE OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL PATIENTS. WITH THAT. STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION ON ISSUE THREE WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. SIMILAR PATTERSON WELCOME MISTER CHAIR AND. MEMBERS. WE ARE REQUESTING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. WHICH WITH A FEDERAL MATCH WILL BE A TOTAL OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IT APPEARS TO US THAT. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OR PERHAPS UNINTENTIONALLY. ARE AND WE ARE ASKING FOR PARITY. AND INCLUSION WITH OTHER SIMILAR PROVIDERS. THE CENTERS PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES TO CHILDREN WITH SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITIONS. BUT ALLOWED CHILDREN TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER DEVELOP FRIENDSHIPS BE KIDS THE PART OF THE COMMUNITY WHILE RECEIVING. THE CARE THEY NEED. PT EIGHT SEIZE REIMBURSEMENT RATES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR FOURTEEN YEARS MAKING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO RETAIN. THE BEST QUALITY NURSES AND PROVIDERS OF CARE FOR CHILDREN. TO CLOSE OR LIMIT HOURS. OR TO NOT EXPAND OR OPEN NEW FACILITIES BECAUSE OF LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THIS FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST WILL BRING PARITY FOR PDA AGENCIES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCIES WHO PROVIDE AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT SERVICE FOR CHILDREN IN THEIR HOMES. HOME HEALTH AGENCIES AND PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CENTERS. HAVE HISTORICALLY RECEIVE THE SAME REIMBURSEMENT RATES. HERE TODAY IS TERRY RICARDO CHAIR OF THE PEDIATRIC DE HEALTH CARE COALITION. TO ALSO PROVIDE TESTIMONY THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE TRAVELLED HERE. TODAY TO SHOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THEM THAT THE CENTERS KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE REQUEST THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO FURTHER EXPLAIN A REQUEST AND BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. MY NAME IS TERRY ROCH YADDO I AM A REGISTERED NURSE FORMERLY OPERATED A HOME HEALTH AGENCY. AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO HAVE OPERATED PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE CENTERS. CURRENTLY I HAVE TO CENTERS ONE IN SAN DIEGO AND ONE IN VISTA. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CHAIRS PERMISSION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARENTS THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO BE HERE TODAY TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING. YOU HAVE WHAT KIND OF THE ROWDY BUNCH IN THE BACK. NO ONE TOLD CHILDREN TO BE QUIET. THERE ARE EIGHTEEN P. H. SEES IN CALIFORNIA WHO PROVIDE SKILLED NURSING CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. PEDIATRIC TO HEALTH CARE CENTERS PROVIDE SKILLED NURSING CARE TO CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE OR TECHNOLOGY DEPENDENT. WE CAN ALSO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN WHEN THEY TURN TWENTY ONE IF WE ARE LICENSED FOR TRANSITIONAL CARE UNIT. PD AGENCIES MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR CHILDREN TO SOME REMAIN AT HOME. WITH THEIR FAMILIES AT THE SAME TIME THEY RECEIVE SKILLED NURSING CARE. THEY ALSO RECEIVE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE FRIENDS AND BE A CHILD. NOT SOMEONE WHO IS DIM DEFINED BY THEIR HEALTH CONDITION OR THEIR WAY OF COMMUNICATING. WE HAVE SENSORY ROOMS BALL PITS ACCESSIBLE SWINGS PARTIES AND FIELD TRIPS. PDH SEES MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PARENTS TO CONTINUE WORKING. MANY OF OUR PARENTS ARE SINGLE PARENTS. MANY OF OUR CHILDREN REQUIRE ROUND THE CLOCK CARE. MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ATTEND OUR CENTER FOR THE TWO HOURS AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT THEIR PARENTS CAN CONTINUE TO WORK A FULL WORK DAY. EACH CHILD IS UNIQUE IMPORTANT AND WELL LOVED AT OUR CENTERS. FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN YEARS PDA IT SEES BEEN PAID TWENTY NINE DOLLARS AND FORTY ONE CENTS PER HOUR. THIS SET RATE HAS STAYED THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BUILDINGS TO MAINTAIN. INCREASE RENTS FOR CENTERS AND THE EVER INCREASING COST OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES. ADDITIONALLY. ALL ACCREDITED NURSING SCHOOLS MUST HAVE A PEDIATRIC ROTATION AS PART OF THEIR CURRICULUM. PDH SEES OF THE ONLY PEDIATRIC ROTATION AVAILABLE FOR HUNDREDS OF FUTURE NURSES. WITHOUT PT AGENCIES AS THEIR PEDIATRIC ROTATION MANY FUTURE NURSES WON'T BE ABLE TO CHOOSE AND TRAIN IN THE NURSING CAREER. FOR THEIR FUTURES. WE HAVE A GREAT DIFFICULT. WE HAVE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY. RECRUITING AND RETAINING LV ENDS DUE TO COMPETITION WITH HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. WE'VE HAD TO CANCEL PROGRAMS REDUCE HOURS OF OPERATION AND LIMIT ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF STAFF WILLING TO PROVIDE NURSING CARE FOR THE RATES THAT WE RECEIVE. FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO FILL SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE APPROVED HOURS THE OTHER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DO. BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE STAFF. TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THOSE KIDS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT HOME HEALTH AGENCIES IN PAC'S CARE FOR THE SAME CHILD? UNDER EPS TO T. BOTH PDA IT SEES AN IN HOME CARE OUR SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES. A CHILD IS AUTHORIZED A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS TO USE EACH MONTH BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY. THEIR LEVEL OF CARE NEEDS AN INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE. IF ONE OF OUR CHILDREN IS SICK AND NEEDS TO STAY HOME THEY CAN USE THEIR HOURS FOR IN HOME CARE. IF A FAMILY PER FAIRS PREFERS THEIR CHILD CARE FOR AT HOME THEY CAN ALSO USE THE SERVICES OF OUR CENTER FOR A CHANGE OF PACE OR FOR WHATEVER REASON. THEY CHOOSE. IT'S A LOT ABOUT CHOICE. WHILE THE CURRENT RATES EXCEPTIONALLY LOW IT IS EQUITABLE IF THE HOME HEALTH AGENCIES RECEIVE A RATE INCREASE AND PDAS SEES DO NOT. PAC'S WILL BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT STAFF LOSE EVEN MORE STAFF AND WILL BE IN JEOPARDY OF CLOSING. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE INCREASED RATE FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCIES. BUT ANY RATE INCREASE MUST BE EQUITABLE AND BALANCE AND PRESERVE CHOICE FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN. WE ASK OF THE PD EIGHT SEASON HOME HEALTH AGENCIES BE VIEWED IS INTERCHANGEABLE CHOICES THAT CAN BE MADE BY THEIR PARENTS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT PARENTS AND CHILDREN CAN CONTINUE. TO EXERCISE THOSE CHOICES. IT PDAS SEES CLOSE. THESE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE LIMITED OTHER CHOICES AVAILABLE. THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO USE AND HOME NURSING. OR THEY CAN BE ADMITTED TO A CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITY. THE SECOND OPTION WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOURS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR KIDS. PLACING THESE CHILDREN IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. THESE CHILDREN ARE THE LUCKY ONES AND THEY REALLY ARE. THEY HAVE FAMILIES WHO LOVE THEM. THEY SLEEP IN THEIR OWN BEDS IN THEIR OWN HOMES WITH THEIR OWN PARENTS. AND THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AT NIGHT. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS I WOULD BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU TERRY. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR IF WE CAN MOVE THE MIKE MORE TOWARDS THE CENTER. DEEPLY SHOULDN'T THINK. EVERYBODY BUT A PUBLIC SPEAKING SO I MARRIED FROM THIS. YOUR BABY DIDN'T DEVELOPER BRING. THOSE WORDS SPOKEN TO ME IN A ROUTINE ULTRASOUND WERE THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY THAT IS ULTIMATELY LED ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS RACHEL LUCAS MY HUSBAND DEAN. THIS IS OUR MIRACLE GIRLY MARIN SCHUH BEFORE ON WEDNESDAY. SEVEN MONTHS AFTER LILY WAS BORN AFTER COUNTLESS HOURS SPENT AT SPECIALIST EARLY INTERVENTION MEETINGS AND APPLYING FOR PROGRAMS I AM EXHAUSTED MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM MY JOB. I HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK TO HELP PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILY. I HAD TO LEAVE MY BABY. WHO'S ON HOSPICE CARE IN THE HANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE. A SOCIAL WORKER TOLD US ABOUT TOGETHER WE GROW A PLACE WERE UNWILLING WOULD BE CARED FOR AND LOVED. LILY IS A VERY SOCIAL GIRL WHO LOVES LAUGHING CIRCLE TIME DANCE PARTIES AND DISNEY SONGS. SHE IS LOTS OF FRIENDS BOTH MEDICAL AND TYPICAL THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE CARE THAT SHE HAS RECEIVED A TOGETHER WE GROW. WILLOWS BABY BROTHER CAME ALONG WHOSE MEDICALLY TYPICAL WE STRESSED ABOUT HOW WE WOULD CARE FOR A NEW BABY BOTH WORK FULL TIME AND MANAGE LILIES APPOINTMENTS SOMETIMES UP TO SIX PER WEEK. TOGETHER WE GROW ALLOWS FOR BOTH OF OUR CHILDREN DESPITE THEIR VAST DIFFERENCES TO RECEIVE EXCELLENT CARE IN A SINGLE PLACE. THIS ALLOWS DENYING TO CONTINUE WORKING FULL TIME STAYING OFF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. OUR SON ACE OUT ROSEN THRIVES IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE CHILDREN LIKE HIS SISTER ARE LOVED ACCEPTED RESPECTED AND INCLUDED. I KNOW BECAUSE OF HIS TIME TOGETHER WE GROW HE WILL GROW INTO A MAN WILL VALUE AND RESPECT CHILDREN AND ADULTS OF ALL ABILITIES. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THE RATE INCREASE ALSO APPLIED OF PD AGENCIES SO FAMILIES LIKE OURS CAN HAVE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING OUR CHILDREN BOTH MEDICAL AND TYPICAL ARE CARED FOR IN CAN GROW TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU LITTLE. TOUGH ACT FALL ON. HELLO MY NAME IS DEAN LUCAS AND THIS IS ALSO MY DAUGHTER LILY. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME WITH YOU GUYS TODAY BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT OF. MY DAUGHTER LILY SHE CANNOT SPEAK BUT SHE'S NOT ON MOBILE. IS NOT CAPABLE INDEPENDENT SOONER FEEDING YET SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING POSITIVE STRONG FUNNY AND LOVING HUMAN BEINGS YOU'LL EVER MEET. IT TAKES A LOT OF TIMETO GET TO KNOW WHAT WEEK HER VERBAL CUES HER MANNERISMS HOTEL HER LIKES FOR WANTS OR NEEDS. AS WELL AS HER INTENSE MEDICATION PHYSICAL THERAPY REGIMENT. AND HOW TO HELP BEST CHEAPER GOAL WAS TO BE THE BEST HUMAN BEING THAT SHE CAN BE. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDING FOR PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE CENTERS TIME IS NOT A LUXURY THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. MANY TIMES IN LILY'S LIFE SHE'S LOST MAZING CAREGIVERS THAT DIDN'T WANNA LEAVE THE CHILDREN THEY KNOW WHEN LEFT OVER FORCED TO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A WAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES. THIS LACK OF FUNDING FOR FACILITIES LIKE TOGETHER WE GROW CREATES A SITUATION WHERE HIGH AMPLY TURNOVER RATE DIRECTLY IMPACTS NOT ONLY LILY AND CHILDREN BEFORE YOU BUT COUNTLESS OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EVERYTHING IN NEW CARE GIVER EVERYTIME AT NEW CARE GIVER AND HERS LOUISE LIFE THEY HAVE TO LEARN HER AND BY THE TIME THEY GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN TRULY HELPER THRIVE. FAR OFTEN THAN NOT A RESET BUTTON IS HIT. MANDATE LEAVE AND IN NEW CARE GIVERS FORCE TO COME IN AND RELEARN LILY ALL OVER AGAIN. HI AT ANY PARENT KNOWS THAT THE CONTINUITY OF CARE IS CRUCIAL TO ANY CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S EVEN MORE TRUE FOR THE CHILDREN LIKE OURS WHO CAN'T ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. IF ANY OF YOUR INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT WILLIAM HER STORY HIGH COURAGE YOU TO REACH OUT TO WATCH. SORRY I APOLOGIZE BUT TO MEET HER AS I WOULD LOVE EXPRESSED YOU IN A LONGER FORMAT HOW IMPORTANT IS FUNDING IS FOR HER AND HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT TOGETHER WE GROW IS PLAYED IN OUR FAMILY'S LIFE AS WELL AS OUR CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT.

THE LITTLEST THINGS I NEVER GET A CALL FROM THE READINESS IT IS SUCH. WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS AND I CAN LIVE LIFE AND GO TO SCHOOL AND GO GET THINGS DONE. PERSONALLY I LIKE I SAID I DON'T HAVE FAMILIES SO IF I WERE TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME INTO MY HOME IT'S A STRANGER. I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME INTO MY HOME AND THEY'VE STOLE STUFF I'D CALL. PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE JOB INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE KING STAND. DRINKING SMOKING CIGARETTES IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. END IT IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AROUND AS A WAY THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE. TO HELP ME AND I DON'T I DON'T WANT THAT. ON TOP OF WE IT'S JUST ME SO I WOULD HAVE TO SHARE KEYS WITH THIS PERSON. HAVE I WOULD REALLY HAVE TO TRUST THIS PERSON AND WHILE HE'S OUT LORETTA'S AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. ON. AND. OUT LORETTA'S HE EVERYONE HE GOES TO SCHOOL WITH GOES THERE SO HE SEES THE SAME KIDS HE'S AROUND THE SAME. SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN THAT HE SEES SENSE HE WAS LIKE TWO YEARS OLD.

CONTINUE TO RESIDE IN THEIR NATURAL LIVING SITUATION WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU SIR. TRYING NOT TO CRY YOU KNOW WE ALL COME. AND HAVE A CHILD AND YOU CAN DON'T EVER ASK FOR CHILD TO BE BORN WITH A DISABILITY. AND I CAN SAY IT WAS QUITE A SHOCK FOR MY FAMILY. I WHEN I HAD CHARLIE. HE WAS DIAGNOSED AS THE FIRST US CASE WITH HIS MEDICAL CONDITION. AND ONLY ONE OF TWENTY SIX IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. SO THIS IS MY LITTLE GENETIC JACKPOT IF I CALLED. AND. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS I WAS WORKING FULL TIME STILL M.. AND THANK GOODNESS TO THE PIT AT PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER TOGETHER WE GROW THAT THE CHARLIE GOES TO. BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAVE ANOTHER CHILD SHE'S OLDER SHE'S TYPICAL I THOUGHT I CAN GO BACK TO WORK ALL. BE ABLE TO DO THE DAYCARE THING LIKE I DID WITH HER NO PROBLEM. I WENT TO THESE DAY CARES IN THE LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOUR CHILD AS DIAPERS AND ISN'T POTTY TRAINED AND YOUR CHILD CAN'T FEED THEMSELVES. WE CAN HELP YOU AND I WENT HOME FEELING LIKE I HAD AN ALIEN. AND IT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING I GO WHAT DO I DO. AND I HAVE A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THAT WAS WORKING WITH HIM THAT SAID THERE'S A CENTER I WANT YOU TO GO SEE IT WAS JUST OPENING. THAT'S CENTER WAS MY MIRACLE SO THAT I COULD STAY WORKING WITH MY HUSBAND BOTH OF US COULD WORK PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND USE MEDI CAL AS A SECONDARY FOR INSURANCE. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A BURDEN ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M TRYING TO BE A WORKING INDIVIDUAL THAT JUST HAPPENS OF A CHILD THAT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE MOLD. AND THIS THIS FUNDING IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO GO TO WORK AND HAVE THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE AND AS YOU FOR THE OTHER FAMILY SAY SO FAR. THERE'S DIFFERENT UNIQUE THINGS WITH WITH EACH CHILD CHARLIE TALKS IN CHARLIE'S WAY. CHARLIE HAS VERY SMALL IDIOSYNCRASIES I CAN'T JUST HAVE IF ONE PERSON BECAUSE OF SICK ANOTHER PERSON COME IN. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT QUALITY OF CARE WHAT I GET IN THE PEDIATRIC TAKE HEALTH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS. IS A GROUP STAFF OF NURSING STAFF BUT NO CHARLIE SO THAT ONE CAN FILL IN WITH THE OTHER ISN'T THERE IT'S A GROUP APPROACH. PLUS GREAT SOCIALIZATION FOR HIM WHY SHOULD MY CHILD HAVE TO BE. NINETEEN FIFTY SET THE CORNER. PUTTING BACK AT HOME AND NOT BE SEEN BY THE WORLD WHEN HE CAN ACTUALLY INTEGRATE WITH TYPICAL KIDS. AND HE CAN INTEGRATE WITH KIDS LIKE HIMSELF AND HAVE A SENSE ROOM WHICH IS WHICH IS FANTASTIC. HE. IS A HAPPY KID AND MY MY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO GIVE HIM THE BEST LIFE THAT HE CAN HAVE AS LONG AS I HAVE HIM HERE. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET THAT SOCIALIZATION PIECE AND THAT CARE PIECE TO HIM. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU CHARLIE. RIGHT TURN CHARLIE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN. OF. MY NAME IS BRUCE BOWMAN THIS MY HUSBAND MICHAEL AND THIS IS OUR DAUGHTER PRISCILLA. I DON'T WANT TO REITERATE ALL THE THINGS IT OF MY FELLOW FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE SAID. IN TERMS OF. INTEGRATION OF OUR CHILDREN INTO SOCIETY. WHAT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT? BY. NOT BUT ALLOWING THIS OVERSIGHT TO A CLOSEDOWN. PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CENTERS. THAT WOULD IMPOSE A LARGER BURDEN ON. ON CALIFORNIA AND AS A TAXPAYER I WANT TO. ASK YOU TO DO THE RIVER THE FISCAL FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE THING. AND ADD THIS FUNDING THIS AND OMIT THIS OVERSIGHT SO THAT FACILITIES LIKE TOGETHER WE GROW AND. AND OTHERS AROUND THE STATE HOW THE FUNDS TO RETAIN STAFF. TO CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND NOT BECOME A LARGER DROP BY. RELEGATING R. CHILDREN TO ONE ON ONE IN HOME HEALTH CARE SO THIS. OVERSIGHT OR. BY REMOVING THIS OVERSIGHT I THINK WE COULD PROVIDE A BETTER FISCAL. OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU PRISCILLA. GOOD AFTERNOON THINK YOU ARE MONEYNESS JONI IN THIS IS MY SON LIAM AND MY HUSBAND FABIAN. UMP LIAM IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND HE IS PAN A LOVING PARTICIPANT AT OUR LOCAL PDH SEE TOGETHER WE GROW. FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS ON IT WE STARTED AT THAT PP AGE SEE MY HUSBAND I WERE BOTH SERVING ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY MEMBERS. WE HAD ABOUT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS THEN AND I WAS WILLING TO ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY BECAUSE MY SON AT THE TIME. PRE MUCH LIVED IN AYE CEO HE'S HAD OVER HUNDRED AND FIFTY BRAIN SURGERIES IF YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE. I HAD GREAT CEO WHO SAID WE'RE GONNA FLOAT YOUR BOAT YOU'VE GIVEN YOU POUND A FLASH. ON. SO WHY IS THAT MAN ON BUT I STAND HERE TODAY BECAUSE PART OF THAT PROCESS WAS WE WERE REFERRED TO PD AGE SEE IT WAS ALLOWING US. TO FINISH OUR COMMITMENT TO SERVING OUR COUNTRY. ON IT IS ALSO. CHANGED OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE. MY SON IS A TWO PERSON LEFT I CAN'T FIND A HOME HEALTH NURSE THAT CAN COME IN. WHO'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE YOUNG IN HER TWENTIES AND PROBABLY HALF MY SIZE WANTING TO LIFT HIM WHO'S PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE POUNDS HEAVIER THAN HER. HE ALSO HAS A SPINAL RON IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ME TO LIFT HIM. SO I WOULD NEED TO HOME NURSES. ONE IS HARD TO COME BY. I WOULD LOVE IT BUT TO IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT HIS TIME THERE FIELD ACTUALLY SAVED HIS LIFE ONTO VERY SPECIFIC CATIONS. HE WENT SEPTIC AND IT WAS A QUIVER OF HIS LIT. THAT GAVE IT AWAY AS WE WERE EXITING FACILITY THEY SAID. HEAPED HIS LITTLE QUIET TODAY IS WE WALKED OUT THE DOOR WHEN THE NURSES TURNED AND SAID HEY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY ALL KNOW HIM. ARM AND TURNED HIM SAID LIAM YOU DON'T LOOK QUITE LET'S GO BACK IN AND TAKE A LOOK AT HIM. AND SURE ENOUGH WE ENDED UP IN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ICE YOU AND HE SURVIVED OUT BECAUSE OF EARLY INTERVENTION. THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST ONE OTHER OCCASION THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED WITH SEPSIS FOR HIM. AND ALSO TALK ABOUT JUST A MOMENT. IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE MY SON IS COMPLETELY NONVERBAL AND I KNOW THE OTHER PARENTS TALKED ABOUT THAT. IT IS TERRIFYING AS A PARENTS TO THINK NAMELY CAM EVERY SQUARE INCH. TOM I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE LIVING WITH THE NANNY CAMS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN MY HOME IT'S KIND OF INVASIVE. TOM YOU KNOW THE FREEDOM THE CHOICE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE HAVE BY HAVING THEM FACILITY AVAILABLE. THE RELIABILITY WE BOTH CONTINUE TO WORK WERE BOTH TAX PAYING CITIZENS. ON IF WE SHOULD GO OUR SONS CAN STEP IN THE FACILITY IS THERE THEY CAN PICK UP AND TAKE OVER THINGS ARE IN PLACE. MY SON. WANTS TO BE HOME IN PART IS COMMUNITY HE WANTS TO SPEND HIS TIME IN HIS OWN BED TO SLEEP NOT TO LIVE. SO WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU CONSIDER ADDING THIS. PAY RAISE POOR THEM THEY DESERVE IT IT'S BEEN FOURTEEN YEARS OF WONDERFUL CARE FOR HIM WE HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER ADDING THAT BACK INTO THE BUDGET THINK YOU. THINK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU LIAM. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HEARING US. MY NAME IS HEATHER AREAS AND THIS IS MY SON ZACHARY. I'M. I JUST LIKE TO ECHO EVERYTHING THAT ONLY. MAY FELLOW AND FRIENDS AND. HAVE COME TO THE. AND BECAUSE I'M JUST SO NERVOUS. YOUR TIME IS GOING TO BE OKAY AND. I WON I WON EXPAND WHAT THEY SAY EVERYTHING THAT HOLDS CHEER FOR THEM HOLDS TRUE FOR ME TOO. I'M A SINGLE MOM A SINGLE MOM OF TWO BOYS DUCK CREEK CLEARLY. IS DISABLED AND MY OTHER SON IS TYPICAL AND I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP. ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE THE PTH THESE IS THAT THEY SOCIALIZE OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE DISABLED AND IT IS. SUPREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE SOCIALIZED. IT. ALLOWS FOR OUR TYPICAL SOCIETY TO BE SOCIALIZED TO PEOPL WHO ARE DIFFERENT. RIGHT OUR CHILDREN WHERE THEIR DIFFERENCES ON THE OUTSIDE. WE OFTEN HIRE THEM ON THE INSIDE AND TRY TO FIT IN. AND SAN DIEGO HAS REALLY I MEAN WE LIVE IN SAN DIEGO SO. IT'S BEEN OUR COMMUNITY HAS REALLY RALLIED TO OUR CHILDREN. AND HAVING PDH SEE I TOOK GALLERY GRASS RPD AGENCY HAS THERE'S A STABILIZING FORCE. AND MY FAMILY ALLOWED ME TO RAISE BOTH OF MY CHILDREN TOGETHER. GREAT HE IS ONE YEARS OLDER THAN HIS BROTHER UNDER THE PAST DIFFERENCE. HEY. HE IS THRIVING THE BEST THAT HE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT EVERYBODY'S ON PASSED NOBODY THOUGHT HE LIVE. EVERYBODY BUT. PERIOD. THAT'S THE WONDER OF IT. BUT FURTHER HIS BROTHER. I GREW UP WITH A BROTHER WHO'S VERY DISABLED AND REQUIRES ALL OF MY TIME. ALL OF MY ENERGY. ALL OF MY FOCUS I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF HIM FOR A MINUTE. IT WHEN I GO TO SLEEP. I'M LISTENING. I. IT'S NONSTOP IT'S TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. HOW THE P. H. CDS? THAT PROVIDE QUALITY CARE. AND YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO TOGETHER WE GROW AND I. AM SURE SHE SETTING THE STANDARD SET A HIGH STANDARD WE'VE QUALITY NURSES WHO KNOW OUR CHILDREN'S CITED OUT. WHEN HE'S WITH BY MY CAN REST I CAN WORK. IT ALSO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND TIME INDIVIDUALLY WHAT MIGHT. TYPICAL CHILD AND WE TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. HE JUST HE HE GREW UP TO BE A PHENOMENAL YOUNG MAN. HE APPLIED FOR A SCHOLARSHIP MATE HE HE PURSUED HIS FOR HIS A SWIMMER. AND HE HE JUST DREAM DEBATE AGAIN HE PROCEEDED SCHOLARSHIP THEIR BRANDEIS SIC A FULL RAGGED. AND PART OF THAT WAS HIS SWIMMING. AND PART OF THAT WAS HIS ESSAY. WHERE HE WROTE ABOUT THE VALUE? HAVE HAVING A BROTHER LIKES HUNGARY. AND HOW HE SEES THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT IS A KEY TO BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OUR DIFFERENCES SPEAK. IT'S MAKING US STRONGER AND BETTER AND MORE UNIQUE. AND I THINK. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND I THINK YOU TERRY FOR REALLY. EVEN THE WAY. FOR INCLUSION. BUT I THINK IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW. IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR SOCIETY WE VIEW THE ME. TO SPEAK TO. HOW IMPORTANT ACCEPTANCE AND INCLUSION ES? THEM SOLICIT THINK YOU FOR GIVING ME A COUPLE MINUTES. SOLICITING BICU FOR GIVING US A COUPLE MINUTES AND HEARING HOUSE IT REALLY MEANS A LOT ANTIOCHUS OCCURRED. THE STATEMENTS OF THESE FAMILIES DIMINISH WHAT I'M GOING TO ADD TO THIS MONEY RESPONSIBILITY AND I REPRESENT SHOULD SHIP WE ARE A PEDIATRIC DAY HELP. AND PRESCHOOL AND LOCAL INTO CALIFORNIA. AND. WE'VE BEEN OPEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE SHIFT OVER A THOUSAND CHILDREN. WHERE A PRESCHOOL THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN THAT NEED NURSING CARE THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO RETURN TO SCHOOL WITH THEIR PEERS? THE FAMILIES OF MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THE SERVICES OFFERED BY BOTH HOME BASED CARE AND CENTER BASED CARE. CATCHER PROVIDES THE CENTER BASED CARE. WE NEED THE SAME RATE INCREASE TO APPLY SO WE CAN PAY OUR NURSES AND STOP THE FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT PLAGUE US. ZERO RATE INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND HREE HAS BEEN A GREAT OVERSIGHT. WE'RE SEEING HIGHER ACUITY AMONG THE POPULATION WE SERVE WE HAVE. A DIABETIC CHILD WHO'S GLUCOSE LEVELS HAVE TO BE CHECKED EVERY TWO HOURS. AND WHOSE LEVELS WILL SPIKE CAN DROP AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. WE HAVE CHILDREN THEY HAVE TO BE CATHARINE EYES FOR BLADDER RELIEF EVERY THREE HOURS. WE HAVE A FEW CHILDREN THAT REQUIRE MULTIPLE CARES WITH SEIZURES CHIU TUBE FEEDINGS OSTOMY BAGS.

WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AT THIS TIME AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE BUT AGAIN WANT TO THANK ALL THE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND FOR HEARING. AND THAT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT THAT WE HOPE THAT. WE CAN HAVE AN THAT. THIS DECISION. MADE IN THEIR FAVOR APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH THANK YOU PARDON. GREAT OTHER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TERRY CALGARY HILL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WEAK ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS NEXT ITEM WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION. SO I I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NOT BEEN A RATE INCREASE IN MEDICARE FOR QUALITY BREAST PUMPS FOR WOMEN IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. SO WE HAD MET WITH THE STAFF UM DOS FALL AND RASTA BRING UP ALL OF INFORMATION SO I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE ROBBIE GONZALEZ DOW WITH CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION TO MAKE OUR KEY POINTS. THANK YOU TERRY CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAYS TERRY MENTIONED THAT THE. CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE PRESS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FOR PRESS PUMPS AND KITS. AND THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THIRTY YEARS MOST LIKELY SINCE IT WAS FIRST DETERMINED. AS A RESULT ACCESS TO QUALITY BREAST PUMPS ARE UNATTAINABLE FOR MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS THE CURRENT RATES ARE AN ADEQUATE FOR DURABLE MEDICAL. EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE QUALITY BREAST PUMPS TO ADDRESS THE VERY NEEDS OF MOTHERS AND CHILDREN. IMPRESS PUMPS ARE USED FOR MANY. A DURING MANY TIMES OF OF THE SPAN OF BREASTFEEDING AND ONE IS TO INITIATE BREAST FEEDING. AS MORE AND MORE MOTHERS ARE BREAST FEEDING THEIR EXPERIENCING COMMON PROBLEMS EARLY ON. AND IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE A GOOD QUALITY PUMP TO HELP WITH THE INITIATION OF BREASTFEEDING. I'M OUT THERE ALSO USED FOR MORE CHALLENGING CASES SUCH AS FOR PRETERM INFANTS. AND. FOR INFANTS THAT START THEIR LIVES OUT HOSPITALIZED OR SICK WHEN IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE ACCESS TO FIRST FOOD TO BREAST MILK. AND WHEN MOTHERS ARE HAVING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. MOTHERS WHO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL ALSO DEPEND ON GOOD QUALITY BREAST PUMPS TO EXPRESS MILK WILL THEY'RE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILD. AND. SO IT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE PARENTS TO HAVE GOOD SUPPLIES GOOD BREAST PUMPS AND SUPPLIES BECAUSE THEY'RE PUMPING MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY. AND IN SHORT. BREAK PERIODS. AND THE. TO LEAVE THAT MILK FOR THEIR CARE PROVIDER. TO BE EFFECTIVE BREAST PUMPS MUST BE ENGINEERED TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF PRESSURES AND PUMPING SPEEDS AND PROVIDE SOME ADAPTABILITY OF DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENCES IN MOTHER'S ANATOMY. NOT ALL BREAST PUMPS ARE DESIGNED FOR EFFECTIVENESS OR DURABILITY. THE MET THE RATE SET BY MEDI CAL USED FOR BREAST PUMPS PROVIDED TO RECIPIENTS IS. FOR FEE FOR SERVICE HEALTH BENEFITS BUT ALSO FOR THE MAJORITY OF MOTHERS IN MANAGED CARE TO DETERMINE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THE PRESS PUMP SELECTION. MEDI CAL IS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIRST LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR BREASTFEEDING NEEDS. INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF BREAST PUMPS BUT IN REALITY. LOW INCOME PARENTS HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN OR THE MEDICAL PROVIDER ESPECIALLY IN THIS REALLY SENSITIVE TIME THIS. WHEN THEY NEED OF SUPPORT FOR BREASTFEEDING SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY'VE TURNED TO THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR THAT SUPPORT. AND IT WEEK DOES HAVE A GOOD QUALITY PUMPS IN THE HAVE SPECIFICATIONS. THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE JUST NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE PUMPS FOR EVERY MOM THAT NEEDS THEM. WHO IS IN NEED OF THEM? SO WE'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE SOME SH CHAIR RESPONSE ABILITY WITH WICK MEDICAL HEALTH PLANS FOR THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE PUMPS. AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THE MEDI CAL RATES BE INCREASED FOR PRESS PALM SO THAT THE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS CAN HAVE GOOD QUALITY PUMPS AND THE HEALTH PLANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MAY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES IN THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS. IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE CARED ABOUT SIX AND A HALF MILLION PATIENTS WE'VE I'M FOR A THE LAST FEW YEARS WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE WITH ASSOCIATION. ON THIS ISSUE AND MORE BROADLY ON PROVIDING. BREAST PUMPS TO LOW INCOME WOMEN AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THESE LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THESE THIS THESE PRESS OF DISNEY BREAST PUMPS AND OTHER SUPPLIES NEEDED. AND SO WE WOULD ASK YOUR SUPPORT THIS AT THE TIME THAT IT'S I'M ASKING. THANK YOU. JANICE COUNT CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA I'D JUST LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS. WITH MY CHILD HEALTH COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL AND. JUST REITERATE THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES THANK YOU. THINK. TURN MEMBERS BOB ACKERMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MEDICAL PRODUCT SUPPLIERS THESE ARE PROVIDERS OF DIEM ME. WHEN IT AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. A VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS REQUEST OF THE CHAIR IS WELL AWARE LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE PASSED ON THE COMP COMMITTEE. A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MEDICARE RATES GO TO ON A PERCENT OF MEDICARE IS WE'RE DUMBING DOWN THESE RATES LOWER AND LOWER THE EQUIPMENT'S GETTING MORE SOPHISTICATED. PROVIDERS IN EVERY DIFFICULT POSITION PART OF WRITER LAST WEEK WHO DISPENSES BREAST PUMPS. WHO'S LOSING AN AVERAGE FIFTEEN DOLLARS EVERY PUMP. THAT THEY DISPENSED BECAUSE OF THE COST TO SHIP THE. PUMP TO THE PATIENT'S HOME IT'S ATRASO FROM WHICH LIKE TO SEE THESE RATES ADJUSTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS WITH. JUST A COMMENT I KNOW THAT WE TALK ABOUT. THE EARLY YEARS OF A CHILD AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND I KNOW THAT PART OF THAT IS. BREASTFEEDING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO TO THE THE HEALTH OF A BABY SO I AM IN PAIN SUPPORT OF. THE REQUEST AND HOPE THAT WE CAN CONSIDER IT. IT IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BABIES BUT ALSO WHEN WHEN THE THE MOMS GO TO WORK. YOU KNOW THEY NEED SOME SUPPORT AS WELL AND I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO HAVE FULLY FUNCTIONING FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ALL ASPECTS OF THAT A. OF THAT CHILD SO I SO I'M IN SUPPORT OF YOUR REQUEST. THANK YOU. FROM ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR JENNIFER CAN'T TO ADDRESS ANY PROBLEMS WE MAY HAVE WITH INCREASING THESE RATES IS. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING TIED TO MEDICARE RATES WHICH MAY. PROHIBIT IT AND CAN YOU HELP ELUCIDATE WHAT THAT DIFFICULT TIAS. SURE I THINK AND IT WE WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WITH MORE TECHNICAL FEEDBACK ON THE COST SEEN OF EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. CHANGES AND HOW STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS PAY FOR DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND THAT WE ARE I BELIEVE NOT SUPPOSED TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF ESTABLISH MEDICARE RATES ON. HOW MANY? OF THE GATHERS A. THERE THE FEDERAL RULE OF THAT KIND OF SETS HOW. WE CAN PRICE CERTAIN PIECES OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SO WE WOULD NEED TO COME BACK AND PROBABLY PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU COULD OR COULDN'T DO AND IF YOU? IF YOU SO CHOSE BASED ON THAT DECISION. IN SOME CASES YOU WOULD BE DOING IT WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT GENERAL FUND AND WITHOUT FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY. OPTIONS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU ON A TECHNICAL BASIS TO HELP YOU WORK THROUGH CURRENTLY TODAY THERE. PROVIDED ON A BY REPORT BASIS WHICH IS THERE'S NO ESTABLISH MEDICARE RATE FOR A LOT OF THESE. PUMP SO THEY'RE BUILT EITHER AT THE LESSER OF THE BUILD RATE OR. A CERTAIN YOU NOTICE FLOOR THAT WE HAVE SET WITH A TWENTY THREE PERCENT MARKET BASED ON YOUR INVOICE COST AND SO. IT'S BOTH COMPLICATED AND PROBABLY ADMINISTRATIVE CHAO ADMINISTRATIVELY CHALLENGING FOR PROVIDERS AND SO. THEIR SON. COMPLEXITY AND HOW YOU CHANGE THE RATES. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE SAID ON MEDICARE THESE ARE YOUNG MOTHERS. WHAT WHERE WE WHERE WE RELY ON MEDICARE RATES HELP ME UNDERSTAND IT FALLS UNDER DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHICH IS A MUCH BROADER CATEGORY OF CARE SO THING IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THIS RIGHT IT'S NOT SPUR? TO THIS PART A KILLER. DEVICE BUT IT IS BROAD MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SO THINK WHEELCHAIRS. YOU KNOW WALKERS AND DIAPERS ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. THANK YOU. WAS HOPING TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WELL ABOUT THE AND. ACTUAL WHERE ILL ANALYSIS THAT SHOWED A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT CAN YOU HELP. SPEAKER THAT. SO ARE YOU WANTING TO KNOW. WHY THE RATE WAS? AS WHAT IT WAS OR WHAT WE CAME OUT OF THE. I'M WHO I KNOW YOU ANNOUNCES RETAILERS SHOW WHY IT WOULD BE A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE'S TO WANTS TO INVEST IN THESE BREAST PUMPS. WELL ITS A REASONABLE RATE INCREASE. IT WAS DONE WITH SOME COMPLEXITY OF LOOKING AT MEDI CAL A THEM THE MOUND OF WOMEN IN MEDI CAL LOOKING OUT EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING. THREE MONTHS OUT. I AM ASSUMING THAT NOT EVERY MOM IS GOING TO NEED A PUMP IT LOOKED ABOUT HALF OF THE WOMEN NEEDING A PUMP. WHO ARE BREASTFEEDING FOR A LONGER TERM BECAUSE THEY PUBLIC PROBABLY RELYING ON THE PUMP THAT GOING BACK TO WORK? AND. ALSO LOOKING AT A A A PERCENT SOMEONE ELSE. COULD DID THIS ANALYSIS FOR US ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN IN THAT WAY. IT DOES PRO IT'S. ESTIMATED AT. A PROVIA BUZZ THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE GOING TO NEED A PUMP AT A HIGHER RATE THEM. PROBABLY WHO ACTUALLY WILL NEED A PUMP BUT THE WAIT WAS ESTIMATED WAS USING. TOM THEN AMOUNT OF WOMEN ON MEDICARE ALL IN THE LOOKING AT FIFTY PERCENT MEDIAN THAT THAT PUMP. AND THEN THE THREE MONTH EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING GREAT SO THAT'S HOW IT WAS DETERMINED. WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE OF PUMPS. ARE OF IN OTHER STATES IN SO THIS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE INCREASE IS BASED ON AN AVERAGE OF FIVE OTHER STATES WHO HAVE MUCH HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THAN CALIFORNIA DOES IN SO WE THINK IT'S QUITE REASONABLE. THE. THE ANALYSIS THAT WE DID ALSO IN YOUR REPORT. THAT WE PROVIDED. LOOK IF YOU. SUPPORTED MOMS WITH COUNSELING AND BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT IN AND. ALSO EQUIPMENT. THAT IT WOULD ONLY COST. NOW LISTEN TO DOLLARS LIKE A DOLLAR NINETEEN PER PER. THE PIT AND MEDI CAL TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. GREAT AND. HAVING THREE DOLLARS AT HOME WHO HAVE BENEFITTED. I'M LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REST OF THE KIDS FOR CALIFORNIA CAN. REALIZE THE TRUE OPPORTUNITIES THAT BREASTFEEDING HOUSE AND THE BENEFITS TO HELP TO. IMPROVE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM METAGENOMICS AND FRANKLY PROVIDE ANTIBODIES FROM THE PROTECTION THAT OUR KIDS. SO IT LOOKS AT WITH THAT. WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AT THIS TIME AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX I THINK IF THE BRICK THINK. THINK WANTED TALK TO YOUR BACK ASSURE HER BY CATHERINE COVERS IN THE CALIFORNIA AREA MELONES PROVIDERS TRUCK CALIFORNIA. AS THIS I THINK BOTH YOU MEMBER BOTH OF YOU KNOW THE AREA MIL PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN FUNDED. USING THE. EMERGENCY MEDICAL AIR TRANSPORTATION. AUTHORITY A RATE DEVELOPED ARCHES ME AN ADDITIONAL FOUR DOLLARS. THAT IS PAID THROUGH AT THE USE OF A VEHICLE OF. FEES SO VEHICLE. MODE MOVING VIOLATIONS EXCUSE ME I'M AND THAT'S COLLECTED FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN MILLION AND TWELVE MILLION I THINK FOR IT TEN MILLION THIS YEAR. THAT THEN IS MATCHED AND. PROVIDED A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS A SHELF LIFE. IT EXPIRES IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS I'M SO WE ARE ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER A RATE THAT IS. SIMILAR TO. AND MATCHES A SUSTAINABLE RATE FOR AREA MELONES PROVIDERS THE RASON THEY DID THE FOUR DOLLAR FEES SEVEN OR TEN YEARS AGO NOW. IS BECAUSE AT THE TIME. WE CAME TO THE CAPITOL AND THEY WERE ABOUT TWENTY YEARS BEHIND A RATE INCREASE SO. ON AVERAGE ARE VERY MOST WRITERS ARE PAID ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FLIGHT BUT I'M THEIR COSTS ARE BETWEEN TEN AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPENDING ON. WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STATE AND THE LEVEL OF ACUITY AND THAT'S A ROTH CAR SO THAT'S NOT? I'M INCLUDING ADDITIONAL FEES THAT WE OFTEN. ARE LAYERED INTO. SORT OF THE OVERALL COST SO UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN WE UNDERSTOOD THAT. WE CAME THE LEGISLATURE IN AND WERE HOPING FOR A RATE INCREASE BUT. HOUSE BUT DEFICIT TIME SO WHO. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND APPRECIATIVE OF OUR SERVICES. WE NEEDED TO FIND ANOTHER REVENUE SOURCE ABOUT SO WE CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE FOUR DOLLARS IT WAS APPROVED BUT AS A SIDE THAT HAS A SHELF LIFE AND IT EXPIRES AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR. SO WE ARE RE ENGAGING AND DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO A RATE INCREASE I'M AND THAT INCREASE BY TARGET AT CITING IT OUT THE RULE MEDICARE RATE INCREASE CAN SET IT. AT A LEVEL THAT SORT OF BRINGS THEM UP. TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS OF NO RATE INCREASES NOT EVEN THAT TEN PERCENT ARE A COUPLE OF RATE INCREASES THE HAPPEN AYE MEMBRANES INTO A SUSTAINABLE RATE SO THAT'S WHY WE. WE SET IT UP THAT RATE. HI DENISE WILL TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE SERVICE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MECHANICS BUT. UNLIKE HER TO JUST GIVE A SECOND OR TWO ON THE ON THE SERVICE SO I SUNDANESE CELESTE I'M A FLIGHT NURSE AT WITH CAPS ARE TWELVE AND I SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. I CURRENTLY WORK AT THE MODESTO CENTRAL VALLEY AREA SO I SERVICE THE VERY RURAL COMMUNITY. WE HAVE NO PEDIATRIC RECEIVING FACILITIES IN OUR AREA SO I SERVICE QUITE A FEW PEDIATRIC. PATIENTS WHETHER THEY BE TO TRAUMA OR. IT DEPENDENT CHILDREN THAT HAVE A LOT OF SPECIALTY NEEDS WORD DAHLE PROVIDER CRITICAL CARE SERVICE SO I FLY TYPICALLY WITHIN OUR SCHOOL WERE ADDED HIGHLY TRAINED PARAMEDIC WHICH IS A SERVICE THAT ISN'T PROVIDED BY GROUND PARAMEDICS. I SERVICE THE FOOTHILL AREA CALAVERAS MARIPOSA SMALL RURAL FACILITIES THERE. I JUST RISLEY TRANSPORTED A LADY INVOLVED IN A HIGH SPEED MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT OUT OF AMADOR COUNTY. AND HAD SHE NOT FLOWN SHE WOULD HAVE DIED SHE ALMOST UNDER MY AIRCRAFT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE LEANING TOWARD TRAUMA CENTER IN MODESTO. THAT WAS A TWO HOUR DRIVE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND SHE. WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE SURGERY AND GO HOME. WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICE TO CARDIAC PATIENTS ALSO GET IN THE RURAL AREAS I HAD A AND. TO YOUR I'VE PATIENT WHO COATED WE LOST OUR PULSES WERE ABLE TO GET PULSES BACK. FLEW HER TO A CARDIAC RECEIVING CENTER SHE ALSO OUT WALKED OUT THE HOSPITAL SEVEN DAYS LATER AGAIN I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE THAT SAME OUTCOME. SO I APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX AT THIS TIME. HI MARY MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION PLEASE TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. AND MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEIR OWN AIR AMBULANCE SERVICES BUT THEY ALL ALSO RECEIVE PATIENTS USING. THIRD PARTY AIR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS GET THE CARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING AND REPLACE TO SUPPORT THIS INCREASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TERRY CALLIER HILL AGAIN ON BEHALF OF BENIOFF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAKLAND WE RELY ON THESE TRANSPORT SERVICES WERE A LEVEL ONE PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER AND WE APPRECIATE ANY CONSIDERATION OF A RATE INCREASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OF BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. NO QUESTION JUST COMMENT TO. THIS YEAR YOUR SERVICES ARE CRITICALLY ABOUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN RURAL AREAS AND WHERE OFTENTIMES WE HAVE HIGHWAYS CLOSED. THIS TIME OF YEAR FOR EXAMPLE. SO I I I I LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE THE INCREASE I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME AND. RECOGNIZING THAT. CERTAINLY WITH THE MEDICARE POPULATION. IT'S A IT'S A HUGE LOSS FOR EACH TIME YOU YOU GUYS TAKE A FLIGHT SO. SIDE LIKE THIS IT WEAKENED A CHIP IN AND DO OUR PART. AS MUCH AS WE CAN THINKING HE. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD AS BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR WHENEVER I SAW THE FLIGHT NURSE I FELT LIKE AND KNEW THAT YOU WERE SAVING OUR BACON. YOU KNOW THAT TIME IS TISSUE AT SOME POINT. AND AS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HEART ATTACKS AND SOME OF THESE MAJOR TRAUMAS OUR ABILITY TO MOVE THEM QUICKLY AS. IN YOUR HANDS AND JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO AND THE HARD WORK THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU DO EVERY DAY. THINKING. DITTO. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING AND. I I COVER. ALL OF INYO COUNTY OUT IN THE EASTERN SIERRA. AND. TULARE COUNTING KERN COUNTY AND I MEAN THERE'S. THERE'S NO WAY TO GET SOME THE SPOTS WITHOUT YOU FOLKS SO WHAT YOU DO IS TRULY AMAZING. THINKING. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AT THIS TIME AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION TO. UP RISK I FULLY RESTORED ALL DEMO EARLIER THIS YEAR AS WELL AS I'VE RESTORING EYEGLASSES AND TWENTY TWENTY AYE WE REQUEST THE RESTORATION OF. OTHER MEDI CAL BENEFITS THAT WERE CUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE DUE TO A TRIGGER MECHANISM. UP FROM THE STATE'S BUDGET CRISIS I REFERRED AS OPTIONAL BENEFITS BECAUSE THE STATE CAN ELECT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THE SERVICES ARE NOT OPTIONAL FOR THAT MEDI CAL MEMBERS WHO DESPERATELY NEED THEM. RESTORING AUDIOLOGY PODIATRY SPEECH THERAPY INCONTINENCE CRIMINAL WASHES WOULD ONLY COST THE STATE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS BUT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES. OF UP SOME LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN THE TIME OF RECOVERY IT'S PARAMOUNT THAT THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CRITICAL SERVICES AND SO I. REQUEST THE RESTORATION OF THESE BENEFITS. YES. I'M THE OF MY NAME IS JOHN ABOARD I DON'T WITH THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA WHAT DO YOU HAVE WITH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND THAT BY TO THANK YOU ALL FOR DOING THIS TEST ADVOCATE FOR MY BASIS OF MY COLLEAGUES. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER FULL RESTORATION OFF WITH DIET THREE AS A BENEFIT IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. US WITH ACTRESS WORKING IN THE CENTER WHILE LEAN WITH THAT'S THE ONE MERCED WE HAVE A LOT OF. MEDICAL PATIENTS I HAVE US IN THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING GOOD PREVENT AT THE FOOT CARE FOR DIABETIC PATIENTS WHEN I SEE THEM WITH THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHAT HOSPITALS. FOR SERIOUS FOOT INFECTIONS THAT UP AND LEAD TO AYE PATIENTS. OUT I'M ALSO AN ARMY US ARMY VETERAN AND A GOOD FIVE PERCENT OF THE US VETERANS ALSO SUFFER I ACCESS TO PROVIDE IT TO PUT A HAPPY CAREFUL OUT OF OUR DIABETIC PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CURTAILED SINCE WHAT I DID WAS REMOVED FROM MEDI CAL TWO THOUSAND NINE. BUT ALL DOPE WHAT I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN RESTORED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. BASIS STILL HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO OUT PATIENT UP WOULD BE ACTED CARE WHERE MOST OF THE FOOT SCREENINGS AND MOST OF THAT TREATMENT FOR WOUNDS OCCUR. SO WITHOUT THIS IMPORTANT SCREENINGS NEGATIVE OUTCOMES MAY RESULT AND AYE PETITIONS WHO WRITES THIS AMOUNT OF PLAQUE. A RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE WAS THAT THIRTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN LOWER EXTREMITY APPLICATIONS. WITHIN TWO THOUSAND TEN AT THE THOUGHTS AND SIXTEEN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UP TO THAT WAS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY PROVIDER FOOT AND ANKLE CARE TO THE SPACIOUS AND YET WHEN WE ARE CALLED TO SEE A PATIENT. AT THE E. R.. EITHER WE ARE NOT REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES. OR WE HAVE TO OVERCOME UNNECESSARY HURDLES JUST TO GET REIMBURSED. A MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO PROVIDE SUPPORT BE HAPPY SERVICES. TO A MEDICAL BASIS IS REIMBURSED FOR TREATMENT. WHILE A PODIATRIST PERFORMS THE SAME SERVICES. IT'S OFTEN NOT. THE WAY WE SEE IT FOOT SCREENING REGARDLESS OF PROVIDER SHOULD NOT BE OPTIONAL. UNLESS OF COURSE WE CONSIDERED LOWER EXTREMITY ES OPTION. WHEN A PATIENT GHOST OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE OF A FOOT INFECTION THAT YOUR DOCTOR TYPICALLY AT THIS THAT THE ASSAULT WITH A GENERAL SURGEON OR THE. THE VASCULAR OR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS THAT YOUR DOCTOR WOULD CALL THE PODIATRIST AND CALLED WOULD THEN COME AND SEE THE PATIENT AND PROVIDE THE CARE THAT IS NEEDED. IN A LOT OF THESE CASES WHEN THE PATIENT ARE CUMPLIR EMERGENCY ROOM IT'S BECAUSE THE ONE UNDER FOOT. HAVE WORSENED AND STARTED TO INFECT THE BONE. AND SO THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE DONE IS TO ACTIVATE THE FOOT OR TO TOAST. AND SUCH WOULD INFECTIONS A LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE PATIENTS BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT THE VERY PORTANT OUT PATIENT FOOT SWING IN HERE. I LESS PODIATRISTS RESTORED AS A BENEFIT ACCESS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS OF THE NEED TO BE LIMITED. AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION RATE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE LIVING OF COURSE THE LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE PATIENTS. THAT'S MAKING IT MORE COSTLY FOR THE STATE. IT COSTS BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH TIME A DIABETIC WITH ALL SERIES THREE ADDED. BUT A LIMB AMPUTATION RESULTING FROM FOOT ULCER. IT COSTS ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND AS MUCH AS HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OVER A PATIENT'S LIFETIME. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD SAY BETWEEN SEVEN POINT FIVE AND SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS ALONE. BY PROVIDING FOOT SCREENING AND PREVENTING APPLICATIONS. SO I ALLOWING PODIATRIST TO GIVE. DIABETIC PATIENTS REGULAR FOOD HEALTH SCREENINGS. SAVE LIVES LIMBS AND SAVE MONEY. SO ON BEHALF OF MY PAGES OF MY COLLEAGUES I AM APPEALING TO ALL OF YOU TO HELP US CONTINUE PROVIDING QUALITY CARE TO OUR PATIENTS. BY FULLY RESTORING PODIATRY UNDER MEDICOS OPTIONAL BENEFIT PROGRAM IT IS THE RIGHT TIME. AND THE CALIFORNIA PUTTING OUT OF MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STANCE WITH YOU IT IS ALWAYS READY TO HELP. IN ANYWAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. ONLY ONE. RIGHT MEMBERS FIVE ACT BUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA. PRODUCT SUPPLIERS WITH THE ON THE ISSUE COMEY CREAMS WASHES. WAS A BENEFIT THAT WAS CUT BY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN WE HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THANK YOU SIR. WHEN IS A BENEFIT THEIR SEPARATE UTILIZATION CONTROLS IN TERMS OF QUANTITY PER MONTH PER PATIENT DEPARTMENT CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH MANUFACTURES TO GET THE BEST PRICE PROVIDER IS PAID A SMALL MARK UP TO DISPENSE. THESE ARE ADULTS WERE BEING CHANGE SOMETIMES FIVE SIX TIMES A DAY SIMPLE SOAP AND WATER IS NOT SUFFICIENT PREVENT COMPLICATIONS SO WE ASK FOR CONSIDERATION. ONE. MARY DOLLARS OF HEALTH ACCESS AND WE ALSO SUPPORTS AND I'M THE RESTORATION OF THE REMAINING OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND AT THE TIME REDUCE COST THE STATE A LONG RUN AND. IT'S JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO BEGIN. THINKING OF. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND. MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT. SO AGAIN JENNIFER CAN'T DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I WILL BE PRESENTING ON THIS PARTICULAR BE CP AND THEN I'LL BE JOINED BY ERICA SPUR BACK FOR THE REMAINING ITEMS. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE AS OUR. SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION WAIVER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS VCP IS SEEKING TO. PROVIDE FOR RESOURCES FOR TO A LIMITED TERM POSITIONS AS WELL AS CONTRACT FUNDING FOR CERTAIN EVALUATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF THE WEAVER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. I'M SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS REQUIRED FOR A WHOLE PERSON CARE. WHICH IS OUR. INITIATIVE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON WITH CERTAIN COUNTIES WHERE THEY ARE AND. THEY HAVE TARGETED THEIR HIGH COST POPULATIONS ON OUT DETERMINES BY LOCAL NEED AND THEY'RE OFFERING SERVICES SUCH AS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SOBERING CENTERS A LOT OF DIFFERENT WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED UNDER A STRAIGHT MEDICAID. TYPE OF BENEFIT SO WE ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF THE WEAVER TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO DO AN EVALUATION OF THAT. THERE'S ALSO ON AN EVALUATION REQUIRED. AS PART OF OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES PROGRAM AS WELL AS OUR WHOLE CHILD MODEL THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL IS A NEW INITIATIVE THAT WE WILL BE. I'M STARTING THIS COMING. AYE YEAR THAT WILL ENROLL CHILDREN WITH CCS. WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS INDICATING ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS AND THE CAN ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEM WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRAYER PROVIDING BOTH THE CCS AS WELL AS THE NON CCS SERVICES. SO THIS B. C. P. MERRILY I'M AUTHORIZES THE TWO POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE CONTRACT DOLLARS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA WHEN IT COMES. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE EIGHT AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS MA'AM CIRCUS PERFECT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUMMIT A PRESENT THE NEXT FOUR ISSUES BUT TO CHANGE PROPOSALS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE FIRST IS FOR HEALTHCARE REFORM FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THIS IS A REQUEST TO EXTEND. BUT EIGHTEEN EXISTING THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS. AYE WE'RE REQUESTING ONE POINT NINE MILLION HALF OF THAT IS GENERAL FUND HOW OFFICE FEDERAL FUNDS. IN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY TO PERFORM OF THE CONTINUED INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE ACA FEDERAL REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED. IN SOME CASES. THAT WORKLOAD HAS GONE UP IN TERMS OF THE FORMS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE FADS OF BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT. AN INSUFFICIENT STOPPING HERE WOULD PUT THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS IN JEOPARDY IF. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ONLY COMMENT. MISTER CHAIR ON WHEELS WITH THE I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE LIMITED TERM. AND JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP ON YOUR. RADARS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF AND IMPROVING SYSTEMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS. AND THE THOUGHT IS THAT AND IN A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS THESE SYSTEMS WILL APPROVED. TO PERHAPS ALLOW FOR REDUCTION WORKLOAD THEREFORE WE THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THESE TO BE LIMITED TERM AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES NINE AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT UP TO THE DIVESTMENT QUESTIONS YOU KNOW HOW. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN. SO ISSUE TEN IS. A WORKLOAD REQUEST FOR REQUESTING OF FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS FOR OFFICE A HIPAA COMPLIANCE. IN THIS IS THESE ARE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUANCE INCREASE AND PRIVACY AND SECURITY. A WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS THE HIP BUT INCIDENT WORKLOAD WE'VE SEEN UP TO A NINE HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. IN HIP A COMPLAINT WORKLOAD WE'VE SEEN A FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THAT WORKLOAD SO THIS IS. PERMANENT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THAT WORKLOAD WHICH WE THINK HAS GONE UP DUE TO. INCREASED NUMBER BENEFICIARIES AS WELL AS INCREASED AWARENESS IN THIS AREA. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ONLY COMMENTS ON ISSUE TENTH. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN AT THIS TIME. SEEING NANA BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DIET. TING NO QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN. SO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN.

AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST OUT FINANCIALLY PRUDENT DECISION NUTS MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. AND SO GIVEN THESE CONCERNS THE JAIL BE SEATED NOT CONCUR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND. SUGGESTED THAT THE DA TGS I'M SUBMIT. A REVISED LEASE AGREEMENT. FOR CONSIDERATION THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS TOM IF THE ADMINISTRATION TAKES THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD. CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NEW. LEASE PROPOSAL AND DETERMINE IF IT MEETS. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE JAIL BC. TOM AND SUBSEQUENTLY. CONSIDER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE AFFECTED APARTMENTS INCLUDING PHD. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION CARE TO RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS. HARD YES NO JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND FINANCE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH DELEO.

SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHELLE POCKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSALS HE TODAY. FONG THE PASSAGE OF THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT TWO THOUSAND NINE STATES WERE ABLE TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE ENHANCED NINETY TEN FEDERAL MATCH FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE MEDICAID PROVIDERS. CONCURRENCY ADOPTION OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS TECHNOLOGY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXPANDED ITS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF THESE FUNDS ALLOWING STATES TO APPLY FOR THE ENHANCE FEDERAL MATCH FOR A WIDER ARRAY OF PROVIDERS AND SERVICES. INCLUDED IN THE ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES THAT STATES CAN CLAIM FOR IS THE ONBOARDING OF MEDICAID PROVIDERS TO HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES. AND ASSISTING PROVIDERS WITH THE ESTABLISHING OF A DIRECT CONNECTION TO STATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAMS WHICH IS TIMELY GIVEN THAT STATE LAW NOW AUTHORIZES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ESTABLISH HIS CONNECTION. TO THEIR CURIOUS DATABASE. IN ADDITION TO ADVANCING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES THE ABILITY TO CONNECT DIRECTLY TO CARRIERS WILL ALLEVIATE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS BY PROVIDERS. USING THE DATABASES THAT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THEM TO LOG OFF AND LOG BACK ON TO THE SYSTEM. AND TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION. WE BELIEVE THAT MAKING A MODEST ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING RECEIVE AND NINE TWO ONE RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY THROUGH THE SEA TAP CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF FIFTY MILLION ADDITIONAL. A DOLLARS IN THIS AREA. AS DHS IS ALREADY SUPPORTING THOUSANDS OF PROVIDERS CURRENTLY THROUGH THE C. TOP PROGRAMS. LASTLY THIS FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE OPIOID CRISIS BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO USE SECURE SYSTEM. POSITIONS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE CURIOUS DATABASE AS IT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP. MAKE APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING DECISIONS AND FOR ADDRESSING THE ABUSE AND DIVERSION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DAVID FORD WHO'S WITH ME ODAY. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS DAVID PART OF CAL HIMSELF AGAIN. I THINK SEEING THE ADVANCING OUR I WILL SIMPLY UNDERSCORE EVERYTHING THAT. BY OUT CALLING PARTNER SAID ON THIS ISSUE WE WON'T GET THIS OPPORTUNITY VERY OFTEN TO PUT UP A ONE TIME. ALLOCATION AND HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RETURN US NINE TO ONE. SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MOMENT TO STRIKE THINKING. THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CONSUMERS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PUT UP THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE ADVANTA THE NINETY PERCENT. FEDERAL MATCH AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DALLAS CESSATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT SPEND SOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. HOW I MUST LEARN ON BEHALF OF? CHAN WHICH IS THE NATIONAL FIVE ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COLLABORATIVE WHOSE MISSION IS TO PIONEER THE USE OF SUCH ACKNOWLEDGING CARING FOR THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED. OCEANS ALSO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL BUT HAS IDENTIFIED SOME IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES BUT IS COMMITTED TO WORKING CA MAY AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE IN ADDRESSING THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OF BRING IT UP TO THE DICE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE ALL MAKE A COMMENT IF I CAN HAVING UTILIZED THE CURE'S DATABASE I'M. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS PROPOSAL BRINGS FORTH PARTICULARLY WITH THE NINE TO ONE MATCH IT DOES SEEM LIKE THAT INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE WILL HELP BRING. MAJOR FEDERAL DOLLARS DOWN AND IS A STRONG PROPOSAL SO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE NEXT ISSUE I'D LIKE TO PRESENT YOU TODAY AS A PROPOSAL TO PLACE SOME REASONABLE LIMITATIONS ON THE STATE ONE RECOUPING PROVIDER PAYMENTS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS BUT THE PROCESS OF THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS IN PLACE TO RECOUP PROVIDER OVERPAYMENTS HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF AN AIR THE STATE HAS MADE. CURRENTLY DE IT'S YES HAS THE AUTHORITY TO RECOVER THESE OVERPAYMENTS BY WITHHOLDING PAYMENT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE SERVICES WITH NO LIMIT ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF TIME FRAME. OR THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVIDERS CURRENT PAYMENT THAT CAN BE WITHHELD. ADDITIONALLY THE NOTIFICATION THAT PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN THAT THE AIR HAS HAPPENED HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF THE OVERPAYMENT WHAT THE SPECIFIC SERVICE PROVIDED. THE LACK OF INFORMATION FOR THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR PROVIDERS AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THE OVERPAYMENT MIGHT BE ON THEIR OWN AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY PLANNED FOR CURRENT PAYMENTS BEING WITHHELD. AS A RESULT WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT PLACES WE A REASONABLE LIMIT OF ONE YEAR TO RECOUP OVERPAYMENTS. AND LIMITS THE PERCENTAGE OF A CURRENT PAYMENT THAT CAN BE WHAT HELL TO TWENTY PERCENT. WHEN THE OVERPAYMENT AS A RESULT OF STATE AIR. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE PROCESS AND WILL HELP TO REDUCE ANOTHER BARRIER THAT PHYSICIANS FACE. WHEN DECIDING TO BECOME MEDICAL PROVIDERS. WITHOUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT YOU TODAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN AT THIS TIME. CHURCH MEMBERS BOB BACKGROUND TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY COULD SPEAK ON BEHALF ANY NUMBER PROVIDER GROUPS THE EPC PROCESS IS A CHALLENGE FOR PROVIDERS. AS MICHELLE SO THERE'S NO NO TIME LIMIT ON TIME ON WHEN THEY CAN TAKE THOSE FUNDS BACK. THEN INFORMATION PROVIDED IS IS VERY LIMITED OUT ONE CONCRETE EXAMPLE. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE PROVISION THAT LIMITS RADIOLOGY REIMBURSEMENT AND TO NO MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE MEDICARE ALLOWABLE. THAT PROVISION WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IN TERMS THE ACTUAL RATE CHANGES THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEY WENT BACK IN TIME FOR THE TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND RECOUP THE OVERPAYMENTS IN THE TWO YEAR PERIOD. VERY CONFUSING FOR THE REALITY COMMITTEE I AM VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. RIGHT SPENCER WITH THE COMPANY CAN MEET HOW MY POSITIONS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. SEEING NO QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTEEN I GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TAMLA AND THE LEGAL AND POLICY DIRECTOR AT HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. AND WHERE THE HITS IT WIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER APATHY COALITION WORKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS IT'S THE CLEARLY TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. SO HELP ACCESS HAD A LONG HISTORY WORKING ON NETWORK AGASSI ISSUES AND WITH SPONSORED MUCH OF THE. NETWORK ASK THE LEGISLATION THAT I AM THAT. NO THAT'S IT THAT OF HEALTH PLANS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH SO KEEP WATCHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IN THAT WE HAVE IS HOW LONG THE CONSUMER HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE A DOCTOR. AND THIS IS IN PART QUESTION FOR ALL CONSUMERS AND MANAGE CARE WHETHER THEY HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE OR MEDI CAL. AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED AND I WILL. IN MY COMMENTS TODAY CAN OF DISC BROUGHT DESCRIBE THAT TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE NOW A BACKGROUND OF HOW WE GOT THIS STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG STRUGGLE BUT IT'S VERY POINT FOR THIS COMMITTEE THREE BUT BE REMINDED OF THIS HISTORY AS IT CONSIDERS HOW TO BEST MOVE FOR TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. WHEN THEY NEED IT. SO IF CONSUMERS DON'T GET TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE IT CAN AND DOES HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONSUMER. THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IS DELAYED THE TREATMENT OPTIONS THEY HAVE CAN BE LIMITED. WHAT DICK THE COST OF CARE GOES UP ESPECIALLY WHEN ONLY EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVES REMAIN? AND WHAT CONSUMERS CAN GET TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE THEY OFTEN END UP GETTING CARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND INEFFICIENT STUDY THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND NO DOCTOR REVEAL YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL. AND IN WORST CASE SCENARIO CONSUMERS DIE WAIT TO SEE A DOCTOR. CALIFORNIA HAS THE NATION'S STRONGEST TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE STANDARDS AND WE WERE THE FIRST STATE TO MANDATE HOW QUICKLY HEALTH PLAN MEMBERS SEE A DOCTOR. FOR URGENT CARE OF ITS FORTY EIGHT HOURS. IT'S A FOR PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS IT'S TEN BUSINESS DAYS AT FOR SPECIALISTS FIFTEEN DAYS. HEALTH PLANS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS AND THEIR NETWORK TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN THE SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES. MOST IMPORTANTLY TIGHTLY AFTER STANDARDS ALSO REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE INTERPRETER SERVICES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF APPOINTMENT. CARE CANNOT BE DELAYED FOR THOSE WHO SPEAK ENGLISH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. SO WHAT IF THE STANDARDS COME FROM. THE STRUGGLE TO CHECK CONSUMERS GET TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE HAS GONE ON FOR OVER FOUR DECADES. THE CONCEPT OF TIMELY ACCESS WAS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE ORIGINAL KNOCKS CAN ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BY WHAT WE. NOW FONDLY REFER TO AS GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ONE POINT NO. KNOCKING PLAN THE KNOCKING ACT REGULATES HEALTH PLANS WHICH REQUIRES. WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PRIVATE AND MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE KNOCKS CAN ACT AS REQUIRED PLANS TO QUOTE. MAKE ALL SERVICES READILY AVAILABLE AT REASONABLE TIMES CONSISTENT WITH GOOD PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE. FOR MANY YEARS EACH HEALTH PLAN DEVELOPED ITS OWN INTERNAL GUIDELINES FOR WHAT TIMELY ACCESS MONTH AND FEW OF THEM BUT THEIR OWN RULES. IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES YOUR PASSWORD FROM NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION TO FOCUS ON HEALTH PLANS IMPROPERLY DENYING CARE OR DELAYED CARE. THE SUSPICION WITH THE HEALTH PLANS WERE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY ON CARE AND WERE CONTRACTING WITH FEW DOCTORS. STUDIES AT THE TIME SHOWED THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS TO GET A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS. HEALTHAXIS ALONG WITH OTHER CONSUMER GROUPS LED EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THROUGH THE AGE OF A PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH IS THE BILL PACKAGE THAT HAD DOZENS OF BILLS. THE FIGHT FOR THESE PROTECTION STARTED DURING THE WILSON ADMINISTRATION AND A PACKAGE OF BILLS WHAT'S SIDE BY GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THESE BILLS CREATED THE DEPARTMENT MATCH HEALTH CARE TO REGULATE HEALTH PLANS A PREVIOUSLY WITH THE DEPARTED CORRUPTS CORPORATIONS THAT WAS DOING IT. THE A TO APPEASE A BILL OF RIGHTS GIVE CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUTSIDE REVIEW OF. DECISIONS HEALTH PLAN DECISIONS AT THE NIGHT COVERAGE THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT IS INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW. AND THE. PAGE OF BILL OF RIGHTS ALSO STEPS CLEAR PROCEDURES FOR GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS. WE HAVE HOPE THAT AT THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD BE SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR TIMELY ACCESS. YOU KNOW THAT WAS PART THE CONCERT. WITH RUSSIA BUT NO BILLS WERE ENACTED AS PART OF THAT PROCESS SO AGAIN HEALTH PLANS WERE SETTING THEIR OWN INTERNAL STANDARDS WHAT TIMELYACCESS MATT. AND THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF ENFORCEMENT GOING ON. SO WE KEPT TRYING AND IF YOU THOUSAND TO A WE TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH. AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE BILL THAT DIRECTED THE INMATES SEE TO SET STANDARDS TO GUARANTEE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. WE WANTED SPECIFIC STANDARDS THAT WERE CLEAR MEASURABLE AND ENFORCEABLE AND WE WANT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO OPERATE BY WHAT SCATTERED RATHER THAN HAVING EACH HEALTH PLAN DECIDE FOR ITSELF WHAT TIMELY ACCESS MET. IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO GET THE REGULATIONS THAT. THE EFFORT STARTED IN THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION AND IT WAS A FINALIZING FOR THE END OF THE SORTS NAY GOOD MINISTRATION. THERE THE COUPLE RESISTANCE ON THE HEALTH PLANS UP ROUND THE STANDARDS. IN THE END THE IMAGE SEIZE REGULATIONS DID WHAT CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR OVER A DECADE THAT THERE BE CLEAR MEASURABLE ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS. AND THOSE STANDARDS ARE WHAT WE HAVE A LOT TODAY. IT FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO GET AN URGENT CARE APPOINTMENT TEN BUSINESS DAYS FOR PRIMARY CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH APPOINTMENT AND A SPECIAL VISIT AND FIFTEEN. DAYS. THESE THE LOS IT'S TIME LIMIT ON HOW LONG PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT AND THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JANUARY TWENTY TOUCH. SO GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION HOW LONG OF THE CONSUMER HAVE TO WAIT FOR A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. NO NOW THAT WE HAVE CLEAR STANDARDS IN PLACE HOW DO WE KNOW IF THE HEALTH PLANS ARE MEETING THEM. THE TWO THOUSAND THREE BILL THAT REQUIRED YOU MAY SEE TO SET THE STEP CREATE THE STANDARDS ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO REVIEW HEALTH PLAN THAT WORKS EVERY YEAR. UNFORTUNATE DURING THE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION ON HEALTH PLANS WORK AGAIN ALLOWED TO USE DIFFERENT METRICS AND APPROACHES FOR DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WHICH MADE ENFORCEMENT QUITE DIFFICULT. SO TWENTY FOURTEEN HEALTH ACT THE SPONSOR S. B. NINE SIXTY FOUR WHICH STANDARDIZES THE DATA THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO REPORT EVERY YEAR REGARDING NETWORK ADEQUACY. AND REQUIRED YOU WOULD SEE TO DOUBLE THE PROCESS TO MEASURE WHETHER HEALTH PLANS IN MEETING THESE. TIMELY ACCESS INTO THAT WE HAVE A LOT. WE SPONSORED THE SPELL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST WE NEEDED TO SEE PROOF THAT HEALTH PLANS ROUGHLY PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS. AND SECOND MILLION MORE MILLIONS MORE CALIFORNIA'S REGAINING COVERAGE THANKS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEY WERE AND ROLLING EITHER UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA PLANTS ARE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND AS MORE PEOPLE ENROLL THERE WERE PERSISTENT CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER NETWORKS WERE ADEQUATE. AT THE SAME TIME MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND MEDI CAL HAD BEEN TRANSITIONED INTO MANAGED CARE FROM FEE FOR SERVICE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS A MEDI CAL MANAGE CARE. WE'RE GETTING THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT OTHER CALIFORNIANS WERE GETTING. SO UNDER S. B. NINE SIXTY FOUR AT THE HEALTH PLAN USES A DIFFERENT NETWORK FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE THAT FOR OTHERWISE BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO SEPARATE ANNUAL REVIEW. FOR TIMELY ACCESS ACCESS THE NETWORK AT SEA FOR THE MEDI CAL NETWORK. HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE SAME INFORMATION ON THAT WORKS TO BOTH THE IMAGE THE NTSC US OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT CHECK. AND CHECK FOR INCONSISTENCIES. SO HOW LONG THE CONSUMER HAVE TO WAIT FOR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS. SO FAR HEALTH PLANS HAVE FILED TIMELY ACTS OF PORTS FOR TWO YEARS WITH A STANDARDIZED DATA THAT WAS REQUIRED BY SB NINE SIXTY FOUR. THE FIRST YEAR OF DATA BASED ON TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH RENTAL WITH SO MANY ERRORS THAT THE IN WHICH HE WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER HEALTH PLANS WERE ACTUALLY MEETING THE STANDARDS. DO YOU WHICH YOU JUST RELEASED THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TIMELY ACCESS REPORT LAST WEEK AND YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM THEM. ABOUT THE FINDINGS AND IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT IT'S SOMETHING ILL CALIFORNIA'S TIGHTLY AFTER STANDARDS ARE THE STRONGEST NATION. THEY APPLY TO BOTH THE MAKES THE PLANS OUT AND MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THE A TF CORPORATE THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO THE CONTRACT WITH MEDI CAL PLANS. D. H. YES ALSO DOES ITS OWN MONITORING OF TIMELY ACCESS AND PER THE FEDERAL MANAGE CARE FINAL RULE. ITSELF A FOR DOING ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS OF HEALTH PLAN THAT WORKS WITH WELL. WE DO CONSISTENT YOU TO STRUGGLE OF KNOWING WHETHER HEALTH PLANS ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS. THE STANDARDIZED DATA AND REPORTING OF S. B. NIGHT SIXTY FOUR IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW HOWEVER AS I SHOULD HAVE SHARED WITH YOU. HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING CONSUMERS WAIT TOO LONG FOR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS. AND WHAT PLAN PROVIDERS. DID UPRIGHT BY TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE IT OUGHT TO MATH OTHER PROBLEMS SUCH AS INADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORKS OR FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY. SO GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION. HOW LONG DOES THE CONSUMER HAVE TO WAIT FOR A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT THE STANDARD SAY FORTY HOURS FOR URGENT CARE TEN BUSINESS DAYS FOR PRIMARY CARE OR MENTAL HEALTH? FIFTEEN DAYS FOR SPECIALIST BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR PROOF THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND WILL LIFE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KIMBERLY CHEN OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HELP WORK HEALTH NETWORK WAS STATE WHAT HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY IN REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES NO WANNA. BUILD ON THE BACKGROUND AND FOUNDATION LAID BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE AND SPEAK TO THE IMPACTS THAT CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC ACCESS HAVE. TICKET ACCESS TO CARE SPECIFICALLY I'LL BE TOUCHING ON TWO POINTS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND TIMELY UP TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS AND WHAT GOES INTO ENSURING A NETWORK ACTUALLY MEETS THE NEEDS A BENEFICIARY. I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO START WITH SOME FACTS WE KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF MEDI CAL AND RELEASE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ONE THIRD ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT CULTURAL LINGUISTIC ACCESS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS LAID ON TOP IT IS A CENTRAL FACT WHETHER COVERAGE. ACTUALLY MEANS BEING ABLE TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR AT YOUR TREATMENT REGIMENS AND ULTIMATELY EXPERIENCE OPTIMAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THEREFORE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK MUST BE ONE THAT SERVES THE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF THE BENEFICIARIES. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS IN TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS WHAT IS A LOSSY. MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ORAL INTERPRETATION AT ALL POINTS SERVICE. REQUEST FOR INTERPRETATION WAS NOT DELAY CARE RESULT IN REFUSAL CARE. IN SHORT IF YOUR BENEFICIARY. TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED BY YOUR NEED TO HAVE AN INTERPRETER OR HAVE ANY OTHER ORAL INTERPRETATION. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE VERY STRONG MECHANISMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS LAW HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FOLLOWED OR UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAPS IT MAY BE. WE'D SEE PENS WARTS. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE ON HOW TO INCLUDE THIS IN THEIR TIMELY ACCESS SUPPORT AND CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE BEFORE THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE ITERATIONS OF. HOW WOULD YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE SCHEDULE THE SCHEDULE DOESN'T KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER HOW TO EVEN DO THAT WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE DATA THAT THE PARTY HAD CHALLENGES COLLECTING WE UNDERSTAND THAT? THAT SAID A GAP STILL EXISTS BETWEEN WHAT THE LAW SAYS AND HOW WE MAKE SURE IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PATIENT ARRIVES IN THE OFFICE WITH THE CLEAR LANGUAGE NEED THAT WASN'T FLAG? WHEN THEY MADE THAT APPOINTMENT AT THE TIME DID THEY GET TO GO TO THE OR SOMETHING GO HOME. WHAT HAPPENS THEN CAN CAN THE PROVIDER CALLED LANGUAGE LINE AT THE TIME WITH THE PROOF WHEN THE A MANAGED CARE PLAN HASN'T RANGE THAT PREVIOUSLY? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN? UP PERSONAL QUESTION THE THE APPOINTMENT. I AND THE STAFF AT THE DESK DOESN'T SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE AND THE PERSON WHOSE INTERPRETER ON STAFF THAT DAY ISN'T THERE. THAT STUFF NEVER GETS RECORDED THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES OMBUDSMAN OFFICE IS NOW COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION ON COMPLAIN DATA BUT THERE IS STILL LIMITATION SAID THAT. ESPECIALLY ON FINDING THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. NEXT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER NETWORKS ARE SERVING. TO DELIVER THE CARE AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE WAY. FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT SERVICES BE DELIVERED IN CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER TO ALL ENROLLEES AND THAT INCLUDES LANGUAGE DIVERSE ETHNIC AND RACIAL BACKGROUNDS GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY. ONE TOOL PLANS AND DH YES USED TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO MEET CULTURAL LINGUISTIC NEEDS IS A GROUP NEEDS ASSESSMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE G. IN A SURVEY. PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AGING A GENIE SURVEY EVERY FIVE YEARS. AND WHILE THE GENIE SURVEY IS NOT NECESSARILY A TOOL FOR ENFORCING NETWORK ADEQUACY DOES IDENTIFY CNL NEEDS OTHER GAPS IN SERVICE AND OTHER NEEDS UP OF THE AND WILL LEASE AND BENEFICIARIES. BUT IF IT'S NOT THE GM A SURVEY. HOW WE ENSURING THAT EACH SI ESTAS MONITORING NETWORKS I'M SURE THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS? IN SUMMARY AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. AND IT INCLUDES ACCESS TO CULTURAL LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES PROVIDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW THAT THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT IS THERE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING FORCED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THE NO WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE. ON NETWORK ADEQUACY AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE NATION'S STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. THANKS TO THE KNOX KING ACT WHICH PROVIDE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT YOUR STAFF TO DO NEXT WHEN JOB SUMMARIZING. DESPITE THESE CLEAR ACCESS STANDARDS. OF TEN BUSINESS DAYS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND. MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS FOR SPECIALIST MEDI CAL MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I HAVE REPORTED WAITING OVER THIRTY DAYS TO SEE A SPECIALIST AND EVEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AS SEEN IN THE EXAMPLE OF A SACRAMENTO WOMAN GIVEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER APPOINTMENT A MONTH AWAY AND I KIND ECOLOGIST. APPOINTMENTS OVER A MONTH AND A HALF AWAY. MEMBERS OFTEN DO NOT BOTHER REPORTING THIS TO THE STATE FINDING THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS CAN TAKE AS LONG AS THE APPOINTMENT WAIT TIME AS THEY MUST FIRST. EXHAUST THE INTERNAL PLAN GRIEVANCE OF THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN FILE A GRIEVANCE WITH THE STATE. THE MEMBER MAY ALSO NOT WANT IN DANGER HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ONLY PROVIDER OR CLINIC IN TOWN WHO IS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS BY FILING A GRIEVANCE. AND MANY MANY MEMBERS ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE TOLD TO WAIT TWO MONTHS THE FADING THAT'S JUST HOW MEDI CAL WORKS. DEBATES THESE TIMELY ACCESS REPORT WAS TO PROVIDE DATA ON APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES BY LINES OF BUSINESS WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED COMPARISONS BETWEEN MEDI CAL INDIVIDUAL AND LARGE GROUP MARKETS. HOWEVER DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DATA ERRORS FROM HEALTH PLANS THAT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE END OF NEXT YEAR ASSUMING THAT THE DATA IS CORRECT. EVEN ONCE THAT THAT REPORT IS RELEASED IT WILL NOT CONTAIN INFORMATION ON WAIT TIMES FOR THE TWO MILLION MEMBERS WHO GET SERVICES FROM THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM CODES. THAT ARE NOT KNOCK SCHEME LICENSE. IN TERMS OF ACT THIS TO SPECIFIC PROVIDERS WE'VE HEARD OF LACK OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ENDOCRINOLOGIST. GEN UROLOGIST AND YOU SEE HOSPITAL BASED PROVIDERS. CENTRAL VALLEY. ADVOCATES REPORT AND MINIMUMWEIGHT TIME OF THREE MONTHS FOR AN INITIAL APPOINTMENT WITH A NEUROLOGIST OR METALLIC JUST FOR SERGEANT AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO SEE A SPECIALIST WITHIN A HOSPITAL. SPECIFICALLY A WOMAN IN FRESNO HAD TO WAIT NEARLY THREE YEARS FOR SURGERY TO TREAT HER RUPTURED BREAST IMPLANT. IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND DIAGNOSED WITH A RUPTURED BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER OVER TWO YEARS OF RETURN HOSPITAL VISITS SPECIALIST APPOINTMENTS AND SEVERE PAIN FROM THE LEAK SILICONE. THAT CAUSED THAT THE HER RIGHT BREAST TOO LARGE TO TWICE THE SIZE SURGERY WAS SCHEDULED IN JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOWEVER THIS WAS CANCELLED BY CALVI OF US MEDICAL GROUP EACH ASKS. DUE TO CONTRACT ISSUES WHICH WERE SUDDENLY RESOLVED WHEN AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WAS CLOUT WITH THE MHC. SHE FINALLY HAD HER SURGERY IN OCTOBER ALMOST THREE YEARS LATER. UNFORTUNATELY THESE DELAYS ARE NOT UNCOMMON AS SEEN BY A MORE RECENT CASE OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN IN FRESNO WHO HAD TO WAIT OVER ONE YEAR FOR AN ORTHOPEDIC REFERRAL. WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT. WHEN PLANS TALK ABOUT CONTRACTING WITH THE MAJORITY OF PROVIDERS IN THE AREA THIS DOESN'T DESCRIBE ACTUAL CAPACITY AS MANY OF THE SPECIALISTS ONLY CONTRACT TWICE A MONTH. FOUR HOURS EACH TIME. A BETTER INDICATOR OF ACCESS IS THE AVAILABILITY OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. POSITION SEEING MEDI CAL MEMBERS BROKEN DOWN BY SOCIALIST TYPE. MOST PROVIDERS PRACTICED IN MULTIPLE LINES OF BUSINESS SO IT'S MORE ACCURATE TO GET ACCOUNT OF F. T. E. PROVIDERS SEEING. MEDI CAL PATIENTS DH DS COULD COLLECT THIS FROM PLANNING COUNTER DATA AND WOULD FURTHER RECOMMEND THIS BE BROKEN DOWN BY DELEGATED MOTTO. AS THE DELEGATED MODEL DOES SEEM TO FURTHER NARROW NETWORKS. WE'VE REQUESTED EACH DEE YES CERTIFY NETWORKS AT THE DELEGATED AND LEVEL AND RECOGNIZED ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS BY JULY. THEREFORE WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH DTS TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY TO CERTIFY DELEGATED ENTITIES BY JULY TWENTY NINETEEN CONTRACT YEAR. IN ADDITION WE ALSO RECOMMEND USING ENCOUNTER DATA TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROVIDER IS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS. AND HAVE THAT THE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES REFLECT VESTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE RULE IMPLEMENTATION BUT THEIR CURREN ACCESS CHOOSE THE CAN BE ADDRESSED NOW AND WE'VE OFFERED SOME RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING. BUILDING DCS CAPACITY TO CERTIFY THE NETWORKS OF DELEGATED ENTITIES BY JULY TWENTY NINETEEN. GREATER ANALYSIS OF SPECIALIST ON. BY FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. TEAMMATES THE TIMELY ACCESS REPORTING BY LINES OF BUSINESS AND KNOCKS KING LICENSURE CODES SO THAT THE TWO MILLION MEDIC CAO LIVES HAVE ACCESS TO AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW. AND THE HELP LINE TIMELY ACCESS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE SAME REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT ALL OTHER. CALIFORNIA HEALTH CONSUMERS HALF THINKING. IF YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE HEALTH CENTER PERSPECTIVE ON MEDICARE MANAGED CARE NETWORK PACKED WITH AGASSI AND ITS EMPIRE ACT ON ACCESS TO CARE. MY NAME IS ROBIN AFRO I'M IN I'M C. E. O. OF COMMUNICATOR HOW CENTERS AND NONPROFIT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER PROVIDING CARE TO OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS THROUGHOUT YOLO COUNTY. I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. TODAY I'LL START BY SHARING MY HEALTH CENTERS NETWORK ADEQUACY STORY AND THEN PROVIDE SOME STATE WHY PERSPECTIVE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER SITES THAT SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY CARE TO SIX POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE OR ONE IN SIX IN CALIFORNIA. COMMUNICATOR IS UNIQUE THAT OUR PATIENT POPULATION TOUCHES THREE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MODELS. WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MEDI CAL PATIENTS RECEIVE COVERAGE THROUGH A COUNTY ORGAN I'D HELP OUT COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN. SOME OF OUR PATIENTS MOSTLY PERI NATAL PATIENTS ARE COVERED THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHIC MANAGED CARE MODEL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND REGIONAL EXPANSION MODEL A COLUSA COUNTY. IT IS THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCE ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT MODELS AND PLANS THAT WE'VE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THAT NOT ALL PLANTS APPROACH ACCESS AND NETWORK ADEQUACY IN THE SAME WAY IN PARTICULAR WE SEE A REAL MODEL. IN PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA P. H. SEE A MULTI COUNTY KOS SERVING FOURTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. COMMUNICATOR HEALTH CENTERS JOINT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN IN ON TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AT THAT TIME WAS ONLY SOLANO NAPA AND YOLO COUNTIES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A LITTLE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND PEACH THE LIVES ASSIGNED TO US. AS P. H. C. IS GROWN THEIR COMMITMENT TO NETWORK ACT ADEQUACY HAS ONLY GROWN STRONGER. WE HAVE FOUND P. H. C. IS COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE OPEN LINE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PLAN AND IT'S PROVIDERS AND THE PLAN IN ITS CONSUMERS. THIS HAS INFORMED AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS CONSTRUCTIVIST CONCERNS TO BE ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN THEIR UP TO DATE WEBSITE THE PROVIDES AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY. RECOGNIZING THAT HAVING A ROBUST NETWORK MIGHT REQUIRE THE PLAN TO CONTRACT WITH SPECIALIST THAT ARE NOT AROUND THE CORNER. PHP H. C. HAS IMPLEMENTED AN EXPANDED TRANSPORTATION BENEFIT. S. BENEFIT HAS BEEN TRUMP TREMENDOUSLY WELL RECEIVED BY OUR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS WE NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY IF A PATIENT HAS THE GAS MONEY TO GET TO THEIR NEXT APPOINTMENT. AS A RESULT THERE IS HARDLY ANY DIFFICULTY IN DOING SPECIAL REFERRALS FOR A PEACH THE PATIENTS THEIR* CERTAIN SPECIALTIES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TAKE LONGER LIKE UROLOGY IN ROLLA G. BUT THEY'RE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE OF US WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AS WELL. THEY LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME IT DOES FEEL LIKE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PLAN PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO THE STATEWIDE NETWORK ATTICUS ADEQUACY CONCERNS REGARDING D. H. CS AND D. M. H. C. NETWORK ADEQUACY MONITORING I WANT TO START. OFF BY SAYING THAT SI PC A AND HEALTH CENTERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT STRONG STANDARDS AND VIGOROUS MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS D. H. CS AND DE EIGHT NDM H. C. HAVE BOTH BEGUN TO RAMP UP THEIR NETWORK ADEQUACY MONITORING BUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE THE PROCESSES APPEAR TO BE DUPLICATIVE AND UNCOORDINATED. FOR EXAMPLE D. EIGHT D. H. CS PROPOSES TO LOOK AT THIRD NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT TO ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE WELL D. M. H. C. LOOKS AT NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT AND WE ACTUALLY AS A MEASURE. WE USE THIRD NEXT AVAILABLE JUST AS INFORMATION ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS AROUND HOW FQHCS ARE CAPTURED IN THE MONITORING STANDARDS. UNDER THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ASSIGNED TO AN FQHC RHC AS THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER TO THE ACTUAL ORGANIZATION. RATHER THAN TO A CLINICIAN WORKING AT THE FQHC ART ART IN OUR AGE SEE. THE D. MHC HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIBLE WHAT'S OF TO CBC IN ENSURING THAT FQHC SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENTS REFLECTED IN OUR AGASSI. AND TIMELY ACCESS MONITORING. D. H. CS HASN'T REALLY MEANT THAT EFFORT WHY WAS SUPPORT ROBUST NETWORK MONITORING STANDARDS WE STRONGLY URGE THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM D. M. H. C. MAY BE USEFUL TO D. H. CS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR STANDARDS THEIR OTHER TWO QUICK POINTS REGARDING TELEHEALTH AND CARE COORDINATION THAT I'D LIKE TO HIT UPON. TELEHEALTH IS PLAYING A BIGGER AND BIGGER PART IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM AND I ONLY SEE THAT ROLE GROWING IN THE FUTURE. TELL HEALTH IS A WONDERFUL OPTION FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE BUT FQHCS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION IF IT FQHC PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WANTS TO USE TELEHEALTH TO OFFER A SPECIAL THE ACCESS TO PATIENT. THE FQHC MUST GIVE UP AN EXAM ROOM PURCHASE A MAINTAIN EQUIPMENT BUT IS NOT REIMBURSED AS AN ORIGINATING SITE OF THE TELEHEALTH VISIT. D. H. CS REIMBURSES THE SPECIALISTS AT THE OTHER END OF THE TELL HER HEALTH EQUIPMENT BUT WILL NOT REIMBURSE CLINICS IF THEY ARE THE ORIGINATING SITE. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS IF WE ARE TO OFFER MORE SERVICES THROUGH TELEHEALTH A CONVENIENT PHC BASE LOCATION FOR PICK. AND I THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND RURAL AREAS. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING A ROBUST ON THE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE OF CARE COORDINATORS ESPECIALLY FOR THE MEDICARE POPULATION. THERE IS A BILL ON THE SET. PAN WHICH IS MEANT TO EASE UP SOME FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAT FQHCS EXPERIENCE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF CARE COORDINATION SERVICES THAT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PATIENTS NEED. THIS BILL ALLOW FQHCS TO PARTNER WITH MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS HOSPITALS AND OTHERS IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO BUILD UP CARE COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FQHC AS THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WILL ENSURING THERE IS A DEEP LOOK THERE IS NO DUPLICATION OF PAYMENT. AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR DELIBERATIONS ON NETWORK ADEQUACY THE HEALTH CENTER COMMUNITY LOOKS FORWARD TO BEING A RESOURCE. IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR CREATING THE SPACE FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. YOU. MITCHELL BACO WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. CMA HAS LONG ADVOCATED FOR ROBUST NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH AND MEDI CAL AND COMMERCIAL MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE STATE CLIP PROCESS HOPING TO INFORM THE STATE'S POLICY ON NETWORK ADEQUACY AND ACCESS TO CARE. INCLUDING A POSITION PARTICIPANT WHO IS A MEMBER OF DATES YES OF ACCESS AND ASSESSMENT BY THREE COMMITTEE. AS REQUIRED BY THE SPECIAL TERMS OF THE STATE'S OLYMPIC TEAM WAVERING ALL. MORE RECENTLY CMA HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN VOICING CONCERNS TO THE STATE ON THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE FINAL RULE. NETWORK ADEQUACY POLICY PROPOSAL. THAT WAS RELEASED LAST YEAR AS WELL AS WELL AS THE DRAFT ALL PLANNED LETTER AND THAT CAME OUT THIS PAST JAN JANUARY. OUR GREATEST CONCERN WITH THE ALL PLAN LETTER IS THAT IT DID NOT ADDRESS DOUBLE COUNTING OF PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN MORE THAN ONE PLAN. AND THE DEPARTMENTS OVERSIGHT STILL RELIES HEAVILY ON THE SELF REPORTING OF HEALTH PLANS. WE BELIEVE LACK OF PATIENT ACCESS TO KAREN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE DUE TO INADEQUATE NETWORKS. THE A NUMBER OF FACTORS IMPACTING PROVIDED PARTICIPATION AND FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. INCLUDING A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY REGARDING PROVIDER PAYMENT RATES NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE STATE AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ALONG WITH EROTIC ADEQUATE CAPITATED RATES PAID BY PLANS TO DELEGATED GROUPS AND INADEQUATE CONTRACTED PROVIDER PAYMENTS. THERE'S LITTLE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE RATE SETTING PROCESS BETWEEN PLANS AND STATE REGULATORS. TO DETERMINE IF THEIR AGREEMENTS BEING ENTERED INTO ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN ADEQUATE PATIENT ACCESS. AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PROVIDER PAYMENT RATES ARE A CONTRACTUAL MATTER BETWEEN PLAN THE PROVIDERS HOWEVER THE RATES PAID TO THE PLANS IMPACT THE CONTRACTED PROVIDER PAYMENT RATES. UNFORTUNATELY PHYSICIANS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD AN ADEQUATE FEE LEVELS WHILE THE PROFITS FOR. FOR PROFIT PUBLICLY TRADED HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. SORE. THERE'S ALSO INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF PLANS BY STATE REGULATORS. THE SITUATION WITH CENTER MATT WAS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THIS AREA. TMA HAS A LONGSTANDING POSITION OPPOSING THE USE OF THESE TYPES OF NARAL NETWORKS AND OPPOSES THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS BY PLANS AND DELEGATED GROUPS TO LIMIT PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE ACT TO REFORM THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF MONITORING CONTRACTED PLANS. ADDITIONALLY DATA SHOULD BE REVIEWED AND VERIFIED ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND SOURCES. JCS HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON PLAN SELF REPORTING TO MONITOR ACCESS. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE LONG CONTENDED THIS METHOD WITH INADEQUATE. AND IT DATES YES FOR TIGHTENING MONITORING OF MANAGED CARE PLANS AND NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON DATA PROVIDED DIRECTLY BY HEALTH PLANS. A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE ACS DID NOT VERIFY THAT THE PROVIDER NETWORK DATA RECEIVED WHO HEALTH PLANS WITH ACCURATE. THERE BY FAILING TO ENSURE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAD ADEQUATE NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS TO SERVE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. WE BELIEVE PLANS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAINTAINING ADEQUATE NETWORKS AND ENSURING THAT MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE. THE SAME QUALITY HEALTHCARE THAT NON MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO OH FIVE LAST YEAR WITH CMA SUPPORTED THE GROUNDWORK WITH WAS LATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. HOWEVER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THIS PROCESS IS SUCCESSFUL THE STATE MUST BE WILLING TO MAKE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN THE PROVIDER NETWORK. ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND ESTABLISH A HIGHER DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY BY ENSURING THAT DATA ON PLAN COMPLIANCE AND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND I JUST FIND OUTSIDE AND OTHER SORT OF REAL WORLD ANECDOTE. TO WHAT LINDA WAS SAYING. WE HAVE A MEMBER IN SAN DIEGO THAT IS IN YOUR NOSE AND THROAT SPECIALIST. AND. HE'S HAD. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES. FINDING AN ONCOLOGIST TO REFER TO WHEN HE HAS PATIENTS THAT ARE DIAGNOSED WITH. WITH CANCER AND. HE'S IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA SO NOT A RURAL AREA BUT STILL. DIFFICULTY FINDINGS. SPECIALTY CARE. AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITHIN. A DIAGNOSIS LIKE CANCER IT'S I MEAN TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND. THAT'S SORT OF AN ADEQUATE NETWORK NOW NETWORK IS TO SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. SO WITH THAT I'M. HAPPY TO ANSWER. THANK YOU. OUR PLAN IF I MAY IS TO HAVE PANEL TWO PRESENTS NEXT BUT STAY CLOSE WE MAY CALL YOU BACK FOR QUESTIONS AS WORK GOING FROM THERE HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARTA GREEN AND I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT MANAGE HEALTH CARE IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS HEALTHCARE RIGHTS AND ENSURE A STABLE HAVE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. BEFORE I JUMP INTO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT THE. AGENDA SET FORTH FOR US I WANTED A GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT BUT ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE MONITOR. ACCESS AND AND REPORTS OF INADEQUATE ACCESS IN THAT STORE THE DAMAGE HE'S HELP CENTER. SO WHAT THE HELP CENTER DOES IS IT PROVIDES DIRECT HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ASSISTANCE THROUGH A CALL CENTER. AND ONLINE PORTALS YOU CAN DO PHONE CALLS ONLINE WHATEVER YOU PLEASE AND WE USE IN HOUSE IT ANALYSTS ATTORNEYS. AND WE ALSO HAVE CONTRACTED INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW ORGANIZATIONS TO RESOLVE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. BUT AS AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE RESOLVED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND A DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS THAT CAME AND. SO MOST OF THE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ARE RESOLVED OR STANDARD COMPLAINT PROCESS A COMMON ISSUES INCLUDE CANCELLATION OF COVERAGE BILLING ISSUES QUALITY OF SERVICE AND THE LIKE. BUT WE TREAT ACCESS COMPLAINTS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND WE HAVE SOME SPECIAL PROCESSES IN PLACE FOR ACCESS COMPLAINTS. SELECT SAY FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER CALLS WITH ONE OF THE REAL WORLD EXAMPLES THAT WAS PRESENTED BY THE FIRST PANEL I CAN'T GET ACCESS WITHIN THE REGULATORY TIME FRAMES OR. I HAVE AN URGENT MEDICAL CONDITION AND I NEED SOMETHING QUICKER THAN THE STANDARD REGULATORY TIME FRAMES WE ACTUALLY PERFORM A THREE OR A PHONE CALL WHERE WE GET THE CONSUMER. THE HEALTH PLAN AND US ON THE PHONE AND HELP THE IT REALLY THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN GET ACCESS TO THAT MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN A AN APPROPRIATE. LENGTH OF TIME FOR WHATEVER THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION MAYBE. AND SOMETIMES AN ACCESS COMPLAINT COULD COME IN AS A CONSUMER WENT TO AN OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER BECAUSE HERE SHE COULD NOT GET ACCESS. IN A TIMELY WAY WITHIN AND NETWORK PROVIDER IN SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT AT A NETWORK CARE. AND WE ALSO GET COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS THAT MAYBE HAVE TOLD THEY NEED TO GO TOO FAR AND IT'S BEYOND A REASONABLE DISTANCE TO TRAVEL FOR WHATEVER THAT THAT PROVIDER TYPE MAYBE. SO WITH ANY OF THE SCENARIOS ARE HELP CENTER STAFF WOULD ASK THE HEALTH PLAN FOR A LIST OF CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AND WORK WITH BOTH THE HEALTH PLAN IN THE IN RELIEF TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S WITHIN A REASONABLE DEAF DISTANCE AND WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME. AND IF THE END OF THE DAY THE HEALTH PLAN IS NOT ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS WOULD OFFER FOR THAT CASE TO OUR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT. ANOTHER KIND OF ACCESS TYPE ISSUE THAT WE SOMETIMES SEE IS RELATES TO CONTINUITY OF CARE SO. YEAH WITH THE RECENT OF. WITHDRAWAL OF ANTHEM BLUE CROSS FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. A LOT OF THOSE IN RELEASE TRANSITION TO WHATEVER HEALTH PLAN FOR HEALTH PLANS WERE AVAILABLE AND THAT SPECIFIC REGION. AND SO THEY MAY HAVE BEEN MID COURSE OF TREATMENT AND SO UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THEY'RE ENTITLED TO CONTINUITY OF CARE SO SING THE SAME PROVIDER. THAT MAYBE NOW OUT OF NETWORK BUT IT IN AND NETWORK COST SHARING SO WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CASES INCLUDING SOME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE ENROLLEE REQUEST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REQUEST COGNITIVE CARE AND SO WE WILL WALK THE ENROLLEES THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE. HEALTH PLAN TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE CONTINUITY OF CARE. LASTLY I WANNA POINT OUT THAT WE DO HAVE A CONSUMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WE ALSO MAINTAIN WHICH IS A NETWORK OF LOCALLY BASED ON MOSTLY LEGAL AID SOCIETIES WITH THE CURRENT CONTRACT BUT. IT'S OPEN TO. COMPETITION EVERY THREE YEARS AND IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE DO AT OUR HELP CENTER THEY PROVIDE BOOTS ON THE GROUND ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT HAVE MORE LANGUAGES THAN WE HAVE A CAPABILITY OF PROVIDE IN HOUSE AND THEY CAN ALSO HELP WITH. ISSUES OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION SO MAYBE THE CONSUMERS AND A HEALTH PLAN THAT IS NOT REGULATED BY THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S A PREEMPTIVE FROM STATE REGULATION OR THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH MEDICARE AND THE LIKE. SO OUR CONSUMER ASSISTANCE PARTNERS CAN ALSO ASSIST OF THOSE ENROLLEES. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO JUMP INTO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. LIKE IT'S A THE FIRST ONE RELATED TO THE TIMELY ACCESS REPORT FOR MEASUREMENT YEAR SIXTEEN. MY COLLEAGUE AT. HEALTHAXIS DID A GREAT JOB TALKING OF THE HISTORY SO WON'T RIP PETE ANY OF THAT BUT IT WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS YEAR'S REPORT. SO IN MEASURE YOUR TWENTY FIFTEEN THE DAMAGE HE WAS UNABLE TO COMPARE HEALTH PLAN DATA BECAUSE OF THE DATA ELEVATOR. DATA ERRORS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT WHICH BASICALLY SAID WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT BECAUSE WE CAN'T REPORT. THE DAMAGE SEE REQUIRED TO TAKE UP OF THE PLANTS TAKE A NUMBE OF STEPS TO IMPROVE THE THOUGH CHANCES OF A. DEAL THAT WE CAN REPORT THE SHARE. NATE THESE STEPS INCLUDED RETAINING DATA VALIDATORS TO REVIEW AND AUTHENTICATE THE TIMELY ACCESS DATA BEFORE THEY SUBMIT THEIR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN COMPLAINTS REPORTS. SO THE INFORMATION WE GOT FOR THE TWENTY SIX STEEN MEASUREMENT HERE WHICH WAS SUBMITTED IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD FAR FEWER ERRORS THAT WE WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS FROM WHAT WE SAW THE YEAR BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE AND PART OF THAT REASON IS BY THE TIME WE REALIZED WE HAD SO MANY ERRORS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN. MEASUREMENT YEAR A LOT OF THE SURVEYS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE SURVEYS WORDY DON THAT COULDN'T BE REDONE. AND BECAUSE WE WERE NOW IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE TIME THAT WAS THAT WAS DISCOVERED AND SO WE HAD TO WORK WITH THE SURVEYS. THAT WERE DONE AND WE CAN ONLY WE CAN ONLY ADDRESS THE DATA ISSUES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS AFTER THE FACT. SO WHILE THE DATA FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD FAR FEWER ERRORS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR SOME REMAINED. AND IN WE WORK WE MADE THE DECISION TO ONLY PUBLISHED CHARTS AND SUMMARY DATA WHERE WE HAD A MARGIN OF ERROR OF LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT. BECAUSE WE FELT STRONGLY THAT IF WE PUBLISH DATA WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF GREATER FIVE PERCENT COULD BE WILDLY MISLEADING SO WERE UNWILLING TO DO THAT. AND FOR THAT REASON THAT WE DO NOT HAVE BY ONE OF BUSINESS AS A ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE TOWARDS RELATED TO LINE OF BUSINESS BECAUSE ONCE. WE CARVE TO THE INFORMATION INTO THAT SMALL OF A BUCKET ARE DID IT ARE. ARE SIMPLY AREAS WERE GREATER THAN FIVE PERCENT AND ALSO WHEN WE WENT DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL OR SAMPLING ERRORS WERE GREATER THAN FIVE PERCENT. SO THE RATES OF COMPLAINTS FOR APPOINTMENTS WITHIN THE TIME LAPSED STANDARDS VERY PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY BY PLAN PROVIDER TYPE AND THE STANDARD. BUT THE TOTAL RANGE FOR FULL SERVICE HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SPECIALIZED PLANS. OF A PROVIDERS IN THE SAMPLE SIZE MEETING THE APPOINTMENT RETAIN STANDARD VARIED FROM A HIGH OF NINETY FIVE PERCENT TO A LOW OF THIRTY TWO PERCENT. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS FOR WHATEVER SAMPLE WAS CALLED FOR THAT APPOINTMENT WAIT TIME STANDARD. AND ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF THE PROVIDERS THAT ANSWERED THE PHONE AND ANSWERED THE SURVEY OR THEIR STAFF THAT ANSWERED THE PHONE AND ANSWERED THE SURVEY. SAID YES I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH IN THE TIME LAPSE STANDARD TO UP TO A HIGH OF NINETY FIVE PERCENT. AND SO WE SINCE I ALREADY MENTION WE DON'T HAVE COUNTY LEVEL DATA IN THE REPORT I CAN TALK GENERALLY ABOUT SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS RATES FOR PLANTS THAT OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO WON'T BE FRESNO ALONE BUT IT WILL BE AREAS. IN THE GREATER CENTRAL VALLEY AREA SO FIRST EXAMPLES CAL VIVA AND THEY OPERATE FRESNO KINGS AND MADERA. SO FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE SURVEYED PROVIDERS MET THE APPOINTMENT WAIT TIME STANDARD SO FIFTY SIX SIX PERCENT OF THE PROVIDERS CALLED SAID YES. MY NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT WAS WITHIN THE STANDARD THAT A PASSING SCHOOL WORST IS THAT AN ACCEPTABLE PERCENTAGE. IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT WE CAN'T ANSWER YET BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE THE METRIC SET YET PUMP FOR WHAT IS. WE HAVE COMPLETE THE RATE OF COMPLAINTS THE CARE. WE DON'T HAVE A READ A COMPLAINT SET FIRST WE NEED TO SEE WHAT THE DATA TOLD US AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO WORK A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WITH PLANS PROVIDERS ARE SISTER STATE AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH A READ A COMPLAINT STANDARD THAT'S REASONABLE. ISN'T THE RATE OF COMPLIANCE TO MEET THE STANDARDS BY THE KNOX KEEN ACT AND HENCE THEIR FOURTH SHOULDN'T BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. WELL A HUNDRED PERCENT WOULD MEAN THAT EVERY PROVIDER YOU CALLED IN THE NETWORK HAD AN APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE TIME LEFT STANDARDS AND FOR CERTAIN PROVIDER TYPES THAT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC RIGHT IF YOU'RE A PROVIDER TYPE WHOSE. IF YOU'RE JUST REALLY POPULAR RIGHT YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU BECAUSE YOU YOU ARE PERCEIVED TO BE THE BEST PROVIDER IN WHATEVER FIELD YOU MAY BE AND. YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BOOK UP AND SO I I I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND ITS WAY I RATED COMPLAINTS A HUNDRED PERCENT BEING SOMETHING THAT'S ACHIEVABLE A GIVEN THAT WE. HAVE A DOCUMENT A PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE BECAUSE NOT ALL PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO HAVE. AND EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE TIME LEX STANDARD BUT HOME HOW MANY IN THE NETWORK. HAVE THAT APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE. HOW THE PHONE CALLS DO NEED TO MAKE IS AN EXAMPLE IS THREE PHONE CALLS IS THAT REASONABLE THOSE OF THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKING IN THE STICKLER PROCESS? SO THE THREE OTHER PLANS THAT OPERATE PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITY CARE HEALTH PLAN THERE IN BOTH FRESNO MADERA. THEY WERE FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF SURVEYED PROVIDERS CURRENT HEALTH SYSTEMS THERE IN KERN COUNTY WAS FIFTY NINE PERCENT AND HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN WHICH ISN'T S. PARTS OF SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN STANISLAUS COUNTIES. IS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. SO THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WITH. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CEREBRAL IT'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. I'M SO WITH RESPECT TO ITEM EIGHTY TO A FIVE IN PROVIDING AN UPDATE TO YOU TODAY. THE MANAGE CARE FINAL RULE WAS ISSUED IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BY CMS. AND THE RULE ITSELF DID REQUIRE STATES TO ESTABLISH NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS BUT STILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO THEM TO DESIGN. THEIR OWN CREATION IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THEM. THE RULE THOUGH DOES REQUIRE THAT STATES ARE ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR A DIFFERENT PROVIDER TYPES INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY CARE HOSPITALS AND PHARMACIES AMONG OTHERS. I'M IN CALIFORNIA THE FINAL RULE APPLIES TO FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH PLANS MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY STILL SYSTEM HEALTH PLANS AND DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE AT THE MOUTH. BUT THE RULE ITSELF DOES REQUIRES THE C. ANNUALLY CERTIFY FOR ALL OF THOSE HEALTH PLANS THAT EACH HEALTH PLAN'S NETWORK AWESOME. IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE HAS PUT INTO PLACE. EIGHTY TWO OH FIVE ITSELF WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR IN THIS PAST SESSION IMPLEMENTED SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE FINAL RULE INCLUDING NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IT DOES REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO MEET TIME OR DISTANCE AND OR TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS FOR THE E. PROVIDER TYPES THAT THE FINAL RULE DOES SET FORTH. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS DTS HAS WORKED TO SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR HEALTH PLANS. THROUGH THE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW DATA SYSTEMS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BETTERED ITS ABILITY TO COLLECT VALITY AND ANALYZE DATA THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO US BY OUR HEALTH PLANS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT HEALTH PLANS NOW SUBMIT A MONTHLY PROVIDER FILE TO S.. THIS PROVIDER FILE INCLUDES ALL INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH PLAN'S NETWORK FROM THE PLAN LEVEL DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER. AND THE DATA SYSTEM THAT DOES COLLECT THIS INFORMATION IS CALLED PIECES AND IT DOES COLLECT THESE DATA. WITH UP FRONT EDITS WHICH ALLOW US TO VALIDATE THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING SIMILAR TO US AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF AN NPI WORK SUBMITTED TO US INCORRECTLY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD BE REJECTED IN THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD NEED TO THEN SUBMITTED TO US AS CORRECTED WITH UPDATED INFORMATION. THIS DATA SYSTEM PROVIDES DH YES WITH NEW ABILITIES TO OVERSEE HEALTH PLANS. ALLOWING THE H. YES IT ENGAGE IN MORE TIMELY RESPONSES TO DATA QUALITY ISSUES AND MAKING OF DATA AVAILABLE WHICH PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT. WE NOW KNOW THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF THE FIGHTERS AVAILABLE THROUGH EACH HEALTH PLANS NOW WORKING WHERE THEY OPERATE. SO EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE HEALTH PLANS HAVE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND PHYSICIANS ARE PROVIDER STATEWIDE NOW FOR MEDI CAL MANAGE CARE HEALTH PLANS. BUT WE ALSO CAN COLLECT DATA AT A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR DISTRICT THIRTY ONE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A TOTAL OF NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE TOTAL MEDI CAL PHYSICIANS WITH THREE POINT FOUR PHYSICIANS PER TWELVE HUNDRED. MEMBERS WHICH EXCEEDS THE STATE PASSED STANDARD OF ONE POSITION PER TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBERS. AND WERE ALSO ABLE TO UTILIZE THESE DATA TO MONITOR OTHER HEALTH PLAN NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING TIME AND DISTANCE. WERE ABLE TO COMBINE OUR MONTHLY PROVIDER FILE WITH ARCGIS SOFTWARE AND THAT ALLOWS US TO MAP OUT THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF WHERE. TO MAP OUT HELP MY NETWORKS ENSURE FULL COVERAGE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT A PLAN OPERATE THEM. THOUGH DATA WERE AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE WE NOW KNOW THAT THEIR WE CAN HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE DATA THAT ARE REPORTED TO US DUE TO OUR INCREASE VALIDATION PROCESS IS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE. JH YES IS ALSO ENGAGED IN NEW ACTIVITIES PERTAINING TO MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF TIMELY ACCESS. SO AS NOT TO SOLELY RELY ON HEALTH PLAN DATA THAT ARE REPORTED TO US WE'VE ENGAGED OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION OR ARE EQUAL AS WE CALL IT. I'M WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY TO CONDUCT QUARTERLY TIMELY ACCESS SURVEYS ON OUR BEHALF. THE EGO WILL CONDUCT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TELEPHONE SURVEY AND COLLECT THE FIRST THREE AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT TIMES FOR EACH HEALTH PLAN IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT THEY OPERATE AND. SO WILL BE COLLECTING TIMELY ACCESS DATA FOR PC PEAS ALL COURSE SPECIALISTS NON PHYSICIAN MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OBGYN AND SOME ANSEL AREAS PROVIDERS WILL BE COLLECTING TIMELY ACCESS QUARTERLY. I'VE GONE AYE IT WITH RESPECT TO HOW QUICKLY BENEFICIARIES CAN GET IN TO SEE THESE TYPES OF PROVIDERS. DECIMATED SAMPLE SIZE STATEWIDE FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE PROVIDERS AND AS I MENTIONED THIS WILL BE CONDUCTED QUARTERLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. I'M SHOULD WE IDENTIFY THAT THERE IS AN AREA OF CONCERN WITH RESPECT A TIMELY ACCESS THROUGH THE SURVEYS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OR IMPOSE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN ON THE HEALTH PLAN ITSELF. I'M AND IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO NOTE THAT WE WILL BE INCLUDING THIS INFORMATION AND OUR QUARTERLY MANAGED HER DASHBOARD AS WELL BECAUSE WE WANNA BE TRANSPARENT MAKE SURE WE'RE SHARING THIS INFORMATION OUT PUBLICLY AS WELL. FINALLY PER THE MANAGED CARE FINAL RULE IN STATE STATUTE DHS AS WAS NOTED EARLIER MUST ANNUALLY CERTIFY EACH HEALTH PLAN'S NETWORK TO THE STANDARDS AS SET FORTH IN STATE LAW. THIS IS A GREAT UNDERTAKING ITEM. DHS WILL COMPLETE OVER SIXTY NOTICED NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS PARTS MEDICAL MANAGE CARE HEALTH PLANS ALONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALL OF WHICH ARE DUE TO CMS PRIOR TO JULY ONE OF THIS YEAR. WE DID ISSUE ALL PLAN LETTER EIGHTEEN VAST ZERO ZERO FIVE NETWORK CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO SET FORTH REQUIREMENTS THE HEALTH PLANS PERTAINING TO DEMONSTRATING COMPLIANCE. THIS APL WAS REVIEWED PUBLICLY. AND ISSUED FOR COMMENT AND WE ALSO HELPS A SEVERAL WEBINARS AS WELL ALONG THE WAY TO REVIEW THE CONTENTS OF IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC WAS WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENT. THE CERTIFICATION ITSELF FOR THE NETWORK CERTIFICATION WILL INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF PROVIDER RATIOS. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT'S SPECIALIST MANDATORY PROVIDER TYPES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDERS WILL LOOK AT TIME AND DISTANCE AND ALSO ANNUAL AUDIT FINDINGS SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION ON A PHYSICIAN RATIOS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S RATIO IS ONE POSITION PER EVERY TWELVE HUNDRED BENEFICIARIES THAT WE DO ALSO HAVE A ONE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN PER TWO THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES REQUIREMENT AS WELL. THAT SET FORTH IN STATE LAW BOTH OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR COMPARATIVE THEIR STATES AS WELL. I'M FINALLY REGARDING THE DATA VALIDATION AND YOUR THIRD QUESTION AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER DHS HAS IMPLEMENTED A NEW ROBUST MONTHLY PROVIDER FILE SYSTEM WHICH IS AUTOMATED AND RUNS DATA AGAINST BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS UPON DATA EACH STATUS THE MISSION. THIS SYSTEM IS FURTHER VALIDATED THROUGH CROSS CHECK IN THE DATA WITH PLAN PROVIDER DIRECTORIES AND THE QUARTERLY TIMELY ACCESS SURVEYS. IN ADDITION DHS HAS ENGAGE ARE EQUAL TO VALIDATE ON THE STATE'S BEHALF DATA ON THE STATE'S BEHALF SO WILL ACTUALLY BE SENDING ARE EQUAL ON SITES PROVIDER OFFICES SO THAT THEY CAN CHECK THE DATA THAT ARE. THERE AT THE PROVIDER SITE AND THEN CHECK TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT SO WE CAN BALLOT IT WHAT'S COMING TO THE DEPARTMENT FROM THE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANTS ARE SUBMITTING ALL DATA TO US. DCS WILL ALSO UTILIZE THE QUARTERLY TIMELY ACCESS SURVEYS COMPLETED BY OUR EQUAL TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC HEALTH PLANS OR HEALTH PLAN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT INDICATE AN AREA OF CONCERN. AND SO AS I INDICATED EARLIER IF WE DO IDENTIFY AN AREA OF CONCERN THAT WE WOULD IMPOSE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN ON THE HEALTH PLAN AND WORK WITH THEM TO BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. AND FINALLY WE ARE WORKING TO UPDATE OUR ANNUAL AUDIT TOOL WE DO I WE AUDIT OUR HEALTH PLANS ANNUALLY. AND WE ARE WORKING TO STRENGTHEN THE SECTIONS WHICH ADDRESSING REVIEW OVERSIGHT OF DELEGATED ENTITIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS AT THIS TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. FOR THIS TIME WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIFTEEN. THANK YOU TEMAS COUNT AGAIN WITH CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION. I AM I THINK WE JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF. PEDIATRIC SPECIFIC DATA AND PIAT PEDIATRICS JUST NETWORKS GIVEN THAT MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ARE IN MEDI CAL. I'M AND THEN I THINK. WE JUST WANNA SAID WERE REALLY DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT D. H. YESUS MONITORING ENFORCEMENT AND REPORTING IS AN ADEQUATE. EVEN THE PROPOSED INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE UPCOMING. A FEDERAL RIGHT I REGULATIONS ON MONITORING. AND MOSTLY JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT PEDIATRIC SPECIFIC AND IT'S IN THE AGGREGATE. SO. IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND OUT HOW CHILDREN ARE FARING IF WE DON'T HAVE PEDIATRIC SPECIFIC DATA. SO. AND ACTUALLY AN ADORABLY WE. WE DID OUR OWN SMALL SAMPLE SURVEY OF. OF A JUST TESTING THE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE STANDARDS FOR PEDIATRICIANS. AND. WE FOUND OUT ABOUT. IT TOOK ABOUT SIX. PHONE CALLS TO GET A WELL CHILD CHECK IN SOME COUNTIES. AND THEN ALSO AND WE WERE TOLD AND REPEATEDLY ARM AT THE TIME. WHEAT TO THE SURVEY AT THE BEGINNING OF. SEPTEMBER AND AUGUST THAT. BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE YEAR THERE THEY COULDN'T COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS BECAUSE AND THERE WERE TOO MANY APPOINTMENTS FOR BACK TO SCHOOL. WHICH AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S AN ADEQUATEI'M ANSWER FOR PARENTS I AM SO THANK YOU FOR THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. SEE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. ALL START WITH A FEW QUESTIONS IF I CAN. FIRST I WANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE DO WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT NETWORK ADEQUACY. SO I'D THIS IS JENNIFER CAN'T. DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE OR CERTAIN PROVIDER TYPES THAT WE WILL STIPULATE THAT WE HAVE DIFFICULTY. THERE ARE CERTAIN ZIP CODES WHERE WE HAVE EXEMPTED MANAGED CARE ALTOGETHER AND MEDICAL BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY. NOT ENOUGH. PROVIDERS WITHIN REASONABLE DISTANCE SINCE A MANAGE CARE IS NOT IN THOSE AREAS. I'M I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PLANS AND I THAT WE THAT WE WOULD SAY THIS CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS ARE. I'M ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN FACT I WAS IN A MEETING WITH ONE THE OTHER DAY AND I WANTED TO RUN UP TO HIM AND SAY. YOU KNOW CURRY CONTRACTING WITH AND HOW CAN WE GET YOU TO CONTRACT THERE ARE CERTAIN. SPECIALTIES THAT ARE JUST EXTREMELY DIFFICULT DEPENDING ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT YOU'RE IN IN THE STATE BECAUSE. THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VOLUME IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND IF YOU'RE IN A CERTAIN RURAL AREA IF YOU'RE NEUROLOGISTS. AND YOUR YOU KNOW I COME FROM MARIPOSA COUNTY SO. THERE'S ONLY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY THERE'S NOT A NEUROLOGISTS THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THAT COUNTY BECAUSE OF THE LOW. POPULATION ALTOGETHER AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE COME A GREAT DEAL IN TERMS OF OUR TOOLS. AND OUR DATA IN ORDER TO MONITOR NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A HUNDRED PERCENT COVERAGE FOR A HUNDRED YOU KNOW PERCENT OF THE TIME MEETING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SO MUCH FARTHER ALONG THAN WE. USED TO BE AND THAT YOU KNOW SERIOUS VERY. KIND OF TOPICAL IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATION THAT WE HAVE REALLY GROWN UP AS A STATE AND AS A DEPARTMENT. BUT WE HAVE REALLY MATURED OUR SYSTEMS AND SO I'M. I BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE CERTAIN AREAS OR SPECIALTIES THAT WE WILL ALWAYS AND STRUGGLE WITH NOT JUST FOR MEDI CAL BUT FOR BOTH. MEDI CAL AND COMMERCIAL AND OTHER TYPES OF OF POPULATIONS WHAT I. ON. HOPE YOU HEAR FROM US IS IT SEEMS AS IF THIS IS AN ONGOING. PROBLEM AND EVEN IF WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES. WE BEAR THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. TO ARE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. THE SERVICES AS DESIGNATED BY THE KNOX KEEN ACT AND SO. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS IT SPECIFICALLY THAT DETERMINES NETWORK ADEQUACY AND AUTHORIZES. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR DEPARTMENT. WE AND CERTAINLY AND MARY CAMPBELL WHO'S THE STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR SHE HAS TO PERSONALLY CERTIFY EVERY SINGLE PLANNED NETWORK BY JULY FIRST AND AGAIN SARAH SPEAKING ONLY TO MEDICAL MANAGED CARE WHICH IS WITHIN HER PURVIEW. THESE ARE ALSO NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF OUR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THERE'S FIFTY SIX OF THEM. TEN COUNTIES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NETWORKS AND ALL OF THE DELL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN BOTH SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO PROBABLY WELL OVER. OF HUNDRED AND. TWENTY NETWORK CERTIFICATIONS THAT SHE WILL HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON AND CERTIFY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SHE WILL NOT DO THAT UNTIL WE HAVE. MADE SURE THAT THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE PLANS HAS BEEN BOTH VALIDATED AND THAT WE FEEL IT'S ADEQUATE FOR THE POPULATION. IN THAT COUNTY OR IN THAT SERVICE AREA. UNDER THE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE BILL. TO THE EXTENT THAT PLANTS DO NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK MEANING THEY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF. A CERTAIN TYPE OF SPECIALIST OR ON THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SIDE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRISTS. TO HANDLE THE POPULATIONTHAT WE ESTIMATE THAT THEY NEED. THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR CERTIFICATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL INVOLVE THEM PAIN OUT OF NETWORK FOR PROVIDERS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY CAN HAVE A CONTRACT GOOD NETWORK IN PLACE THAT MEETS NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS. SO I THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING BOTH TO IMPART. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE. PROCESS AND THE CERTIFICATION ON OUR BEHALF AND I'M NOT SPEAKING TO THE D. IMAGE SEE ISSUES AROUND WHAT THEY DO TO VALIDATE NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT I THINK. THE PLANS. KNOW OUR INTENT OF HOW WE INTEND TO CERTIFY BECAUSE WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND THEN AGAIN IT'S A MATURITY OF BOTH DATA AND PROCESS. I MEAN WE HOPE THAT. THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD'S THAT. OUR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T TOUCH RAY I CAN'T GROW PHYSICIANS ON AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO GROW SOME CHILD PSYCHIATRIST ON THOSE ARE ISSUES BIGGER AND BROADER BINDER BEYOND OUR DEPARTMENT BUT I KNOW THAT WE WORK WITH THE PLAN'S PRETTY CLOSELY TO BOTH IDENTIFY THOSE. AND THEY ARE PUSH TO PAY AT CERTAIN POINTS WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET A PATIENT TO THE PLACE THAT THEY NEED TO BE IF THEY DON'T HAVE SOMETHING WITHIN THEIR CONTRACTING NETWORK. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEDICAL PATIENTS BEING IMPROPERLY DENIED ACCESS TO CARE IN ORDER TO REDUCE COSTS. FOR MORE EXPLICITLY IF I CAN SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKING PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS FROM ACCESSING IN NETWORK. SPECIALISTS WHO ARE DEEMED TOO COSTLY. SO I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO. AN ISSUE THAT HAPPENED IN THE FALL. IN WHICH ARE THERE WERE WHISTLEBLOWER ACCOUNTS OF IMPROPER ON ACTIVITIES BY A NON. IT WASN'T A MEDICAL GROUP IT WASN'T HEALTH PLAN IT WAS A. ENTITY OUTSIDE OF THAT AND SO WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND THE PLANS TO BOTH. QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION AS WELL AS PUT ALL OF OUR PLANS ON A CORRECTIVE ACTION. I PLAN THAT SARAH AND HER TEAM HAVE BEEN LEADING TO MAKE SURE THAT. PATIENTS WERE NOT IMPROPERLY EITHER DENIED OR THAT REFERRAL FORM. REFERRALS NEEDED TO BE MADE TO THE RIGHT PROVIDER FOR THE RIGHT ITEM BUT PLANS WENT BACK. GOING BACK TWO YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REACHED OUT TO PATIENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAD THERE BEEN A REFERRAL OR HAD THERE BEEN AN AUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICES THAT WERE NOT PROVIDED THAT WE MADE. UP FOR THAT AND SO I WOULD AND SAY THAT THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE AN EXAMPLE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND WE'RE CURRENTLY STILL I'M WORKING WITH THE PLANTS UNDER THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS FOR THE. DOES IT SHOW THOUGH IT LACKED GOAL LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF AMONG THE COMPANIES INVOLVED IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE. YOU KNOW NOT TO USE A EUPHEMISM BUT AS THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE. WELL I WOULD SAY FOR THAT PARTICULAR. CASE THOUGH THE WAY THAT IT WAS. FOUND WAS A PLAN WAS IN DOING AN AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE CHECK. AND THERE WAS A STAFF MEMBER. THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT THAT ACCIDENTALLY GAVE THEM DATA THAT THEY SAID THIS DOESN'T. LOOK RIGHT AND THEN THE WHOLE AYE THING. KIND OF OPENED UP. WHEN ALL OF OUR PLANS WENT IN TO DO THEIR OWN CHECK SEE. WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEN AND TO VALIDATE THE NATURE OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT? INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYED IN THAT ORGANIZATION ADMITTED TO FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS SO I THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY. A LITTLE BIT OF A UNFAIR STATEMENT TO SAY THAT THE PLANS WERE NOT CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WERE BUT THAT YOU HAD AN ENTITY THAT WAS DELIBERATELY AND THEY HAVE NOW CSUS. ADMITTED AS MUCH THAT THEY WERE FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS AT THE PLANS WERE VALIDATING AND SO I THINK IT OPENED FOR US OBVIOUSLY WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY I THINK FOR THE PLANS THEY TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND. WERE STILL INVOLVED IN. SOME INTERNAL THINKING ABOUT. WHAT CAN WE DO? AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON PUTTING INTO THIS. PLACE OTHER WAYS TO DOUBLE CHECK INFORMATION I THINK THE PLANS CERTAINLY WANT TO DO THAT AS WELL BUT. THE FALSE THE DIRECT FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS SOMETIMES IS I'M CERTAINLY WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HAD WHISTLEBLOWERS NOT NOT MADE THAT AVAILABLE TO US. AND I'M GONNA. ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO TO JUMP IN HERE BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THIS IS SUBSIDIARITY AT ITS WORST. THAT BY PUSHING THIS ACCOUNTABILITY FURTHER DOWN IT'S REMOVING THE STATE FROM OUR OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. MEETING OUR KNOCKS KEEN ACT. REGULATIONS. QUITE A SECOND QUESTION DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY PATIENTS WERE AFFECTED MOM BY THAT. I'M I DON'T THINK THAT WE KNOW AND IF THEY WERE IMPACTED OR WE KNOW THE GENERAL POPULATION FOR WHICH THIS ENTITY WAS MANAGING. APPEALS GRIEVANCES REFERRALS ALL OF THE BACK AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS BUT WHEN THE PLANS WENT AND EACH OF THE PLANS. TRIED TO FIND MEMBERS THAT HAD BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OF MAYBE HADN'T HAD THE RIGHT REFERRAL. THOSE ARE MUCH HARDER NUMBERS TO. TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE SOME PATIENTS YOU COULDN'T FIND AND IF POPULATION THAT WAS BEING MANAGED BY THAT ENTITY WAS SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. LIVES BUT THEY WERE. THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY ALL IMPACTED. AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY. HAVE ANYWAY TO VALIDATE BUT THAT'S WHY WE SENT SENT THE PLANS BACKED TWO YEARS TO REACH OUT TO THE BENEFICIARIES THAT THEY HAD UNDER THEIR CARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE. BOTH CONTACTED IF THEY. WERE ABLE TO BE CONTACTED AND THEN IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED TO AUTHORIZE IT. SO. I GUESS IF EVEN IF IT WAS TEN PERCENT WERE LOOKING AT SIXTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE AFFECTED. PLANE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS LIKE THAT. IT'S. IT'S DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND FOR ME I AND I'M SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES FEEL THE SAME WAY BUT EVEN TEN PERCENT OF SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE AFFECTED AND SO. SO. E.. WE ARE DISCUSSING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO. THAT YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU'RE IN. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT IT BUT. IT GOES BACK TO ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY. OFFICE SO WE CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. AND THAT'S. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME OR THERE'S MORE THEN THAN. ONES THAT. ARE ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT WORKING AND SOUL. WHAT I'M THINKING IS HOW MANY OTHER? ISSUES ARE WE GONNA FIND THAT THERE IS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. SO I THINK FOR ME THE OVERALL. CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT NOT JUST ONE DEPARTMENT OR ONE PARTICULAR AREA BECAUSE IF I'M THINKING THAT THERE'S MORE. AREAS THAT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS ACCOUNTED FOR EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTABLE AND I. AND THAT'S. THE QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD FRANKLY LIKE AT LEAST SOME CONVERSATION ON. AND ALONG THOSE LINES THE STATE HAS ORDERED INSURERS ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH TO DETERMINE HOW MANY ENROLLEES EXPERIENCED THE LATER UNFILLED SERVICES. DO WE HAVE ANY RESULTS FROM THAT QUARTER SO WE DO COLLECT WEEKLY REPORTS FROM OUR HEALTH PLANS AND THEY HAVE BEEN ONGOING IT'S ADMITTING THEM TO US THE. HEALTH PLANS THEMSELVES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REACHING OUT TO BENEFICIARIES CONTACTING THEM AND SO WE DON'T HAVE FINAL NUMBERS AT THIS TIME BUT I EXPECT WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE IN THE FUTURE. WHAT CAN THE MHC DO TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF THEIR TIMELY ACCESS COMPLIANCE DATA AND HOW DO WE DISAGGREGATED THIS DATA TO ENSURE THAT SUB SPECIALTY CARE? IS BEING MET. SO ANOTHER THE STEPS THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT. REQUIRING THE INDEPENDENT IT A VALIDATOR. TO VALIDATE THE DATA BEFORE IT SUBMITTED TO THE DAMAGE SEE. HAS ALREADY APPROVED THE. DATA QUALITY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DISAGGREGATED AS YOU MENTIONED. WE EXPECTED THE INFORMATION THAT'S GONNA COME IN ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WHICH WILL BE FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ARE REPORTING YEAR WILL BE MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE CONDUCTED THOSE SURVEYS AFTER WE IDENTIFIED THE ERRORS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN CLICK HERE. AND SO WERE WERE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT REPORT AND EXPECT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPORT ON GRANT. OF MUCH MORE GRANULARITY INCLUDING MORE LOCAL LEVEL AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO DO EVERY COUNTY BECAUSE. AT THE AN AMAZING EXAMPLE THAT JENNIFER GAVE AND I MARIPOSA COUNTY SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T GET TO ANYTHING CLOSE TO A FIVE PERCENT. STANDARD AND SO. I EXPECTED ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORTING YEAR WILL GET MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING A WHAT FRANKLY WE'RE EXPECTING CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE CONTRACT VERSES THE FULL TIME. EQUIVALENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. MAKING AND. BEST USE. YOU KNOW IT DOCTORS WHO I USED TO WORK WITH WORK CONTRACTED FOR AFTER DAY A MONTH. AND FRANKLY IS THAT A FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WORTH OF THE PHYSICIAN. OR IS THAT CHECKING A BOX AND SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS ARE ADEQUATE. SO I CAN TO THAT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROCESS BUT I WILL DEFER TO DH CS TO DISCUSS THEIR PROCESS AND WE DON'T HAVE A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT INDICATES THAT IT'S TO TWO DAYS A MONTH THAT THE SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED. BUT WHAT WE DO DO IS WE LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE A PROVIDER HOWEVER HOW MANY NETWORKS HERE SHE MAY BE CONTRACTED AND SO LET'S SAY. ANYONE PROVIDER IS CONTRACTED INTO NETWORKS WE ASSIGN A TEN PERCENT FD TO THAT PROVIDER BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OTHER DATA TO INDICATE WHAT ACTUAL PERCENTAGE IN IT MAY BE UNFAIR TO CERTAIN PLANTS THEY MAY BE GETTING SHORT SHRIFT THAT. THEY MAY HAVE FORTY PERCENT OF THAT ONE PROVIDERS TIME BUT WERE ONLY GIVING THEM CREDIT FOR TEN BECAUSE THEIR INTENT NETWORKS THAT'S THE BEST DATA LEVEL THAT WE HAVE SO. DETECTING THE BOXES YOU DESCRIBED THE ONE FTE FOR EVERY SINGLE. NETWORK THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOWS UP AND IS NOT THE WAY WE PERFORM NETWORK ADEQUACY BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DATA THAT IT'S TWO DAYS A MONTH SO WE DO A PROPORTIONALITY ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MANAGED CARE NETWORKS THAT INDIVIDUAL. ISN'T SO IF THERE AND ONE YOU COUNT THEM AS A FIDDLE IF THERE AND ONE EVEN. BUT SINCE ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS. UNDER OUR JURISDICTION REPORT WHICH IS SEVENTY FIVE PLANS WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE PENETRATION OF MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS THAT EACH PROVIDER HOUSE THAT'S NOT GONNA TELL US HOW MANY FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS. THEY MAY SEE OUTSIDE OF A MANAGED CARE NETWORK THAT'S NOT GONNA TELL US MEDICARE BECAUSE MEDICARE. FOR NETWORK ADEQUACY IS NOT UNDER OUR JURISDICTION BUT IT WILL TELL US BY KNOX CONNECT LICENSE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE IT'LL TELL US THE COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS. HOW MANY PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS? I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO FALL BACK UP WITH YOU PUT THAT INFORMATION WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND CREEK WE KEEP THAT REGULARLY BUT I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE ALSO THAT WE DO DO ANY AUDITS AS I MENTIONED AND IF THERE'S ONE FINDING IT AND NOT IT THEN THERE WOULD BE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FOR THAT HEALTH PLAN AND SO WILL WILL FOLLOW BACK UP WITH YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. WHAT? CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA GIVES AN IDEA OF HOW MANY. I WOULD SAY. WE HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AT THIS TIME AND WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HEALTH PLANS AND SO AS I INDICATED WE ANNUALLY AUDIT EACH HEALTH PLAN AND SO. THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING AT LEAST TEN HEALTH PLANS UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BECAUSE OF THAT AT ANY TIME IS LIKELY. AND IN DUE TO THE EVENT THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED THAT WITH SEVEN YOU PLANS THAT ARE NOW UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN JUST ON THAT ISSUE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE. SO HALF. ON CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS NOW ARE MORE IS THE ESTIMATE THAT I'M HEARING WELL WE HAVE TWENTY FORTY FOUR FOUR CONTRACTING PLANS. IF A PLAN IS ON A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT'S UNDER FOR RIGHT SO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS ARE USED FOR ENCOUNTER DATA. WE HAVE. WE HAVE SEVERAL PLANTS UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION. I PLANS FOR ENCOUNTER DATA THE EVENT THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT INVOLVING EHS AND CENTER MAD. WE PUT ALL OF THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAD ANY CONTRACTS WITH ANY OF THOSE MEDICAL GROUPS OR THAT MSO UNDER A GLOBAL CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SO. IT DEPENDS I'M NOT SAYING THAT ALL OF THEM HAVE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE TWO OR MORE ONE MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED DATA IN COUNTER. THAT ENCOUNTER DATA CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND ONE MAY ALSO BE AN OVERLAPPING ONE WITH THE SENTIMENT ISSUE JUST KIND OF DEPEND SO WE CAN CERTAINLY FIND YATTON GIVE YOU A. BETTER DETAIL WITH THAT. VOTERS A CORRECTION. CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. WELL IN A IN IT'S GONNA IT'S GONNA VERY BE BASED ON WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I MEAN CAN YOU SPELL THAT OUT FOR US. SURE SO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN ESSENTIALLY INCLUDES. A PLAN OF ACTION AND THAT THE HEALTH PLAN HAS SUBMITTED TO US AND THAT WE HAVE APPROVED IT INCLUDES SPECIFIC MILESTONES IN TIME LINES THAT THE HEALTH PLAN MUST COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS WITH. AND IF THEY DO NOT COME INTO COMPLIANCE THEM WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS SUCH AS WE COULD STOP. ASSIGNMENT TO THEM OR WE COULD IMPOSE FINANCIAL SANCTION. THE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT WE MADE. PUBLIC AND WE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FALL RELATING TO THE CENTER MADDEN EHS ISSUE IS A IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A FINDING. THAT SAYS THIS HAS HAPPENED AND THEN BEEN OUR RECOMMENDATION OR YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING THE PLANTS YOU WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO DO THIS BY A CERTAIN TIME YOU HAVE TO FILE. THIS KIND OF REPORT YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS KIND OF A TRANSITION PLAN AND THE CASE THAT WE WERE MOVING MEMBERS FROM ONE MEDICAL GROUP TO ANOTHER. ON YOU HAVE TO MEET THE CERTAIN KINDS OF METRICS OR WE REQUIRE THEM TO COME BACK WITH. DOCUMENTATION JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE BEING PUT UNDER A PLAN FOR ENCOUNTER DATA THAT WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE. PENALIZED FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REPEATED. VIOLATIONS AND THEIR INABILITY TO PROVIDE US ENCOUNTER DATA AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT. PENALTY FINALLY. CORRECTED THE. PROBLEM. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PLANS THAT ARE FOUND TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE? SO WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS AND WE DO HAVE A DEFAULT ASSIGNMENT PROCESS WHERE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES ARE ASSIGNED TO A HEALTH PLAN AND EACH MONTH IF. IN SO WE CAN TAKE STEPS TO SAY THAT ASSIGNMENT CAN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE AND SO WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ANY NEW BENEFICIARIES TO ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE ALSO CAN IMPOSE. SANCTIONS AS JENNIFER CAN'T JUST MENTIONED. WE DID SANCTION ONE HEALTH PLAN FOR UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS PAST YEAR AND SO WE CAN TAKE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AS WELL HOW LONG THE STORK LEE HAS THE STATE. TAKEN BEFORE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF. THE FAILURE TO MEET THE STATUTORY WOULDN'T REQUIREMENTS OF THE KNOX KEEN HOW LONG HISTORICALLY HASN'T TAKEN FOR US TO GET INTO IT DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY OF THAT ACTION I KNOW THAT WE AS TO DEPARTMENTS WORKED ON. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD A PLAN REACHED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNING LEVELS OF FISCAL AND AND INTEGRITY THEY HAVE LEFT THEIR RESERVES DROPPED TO. DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE PUT A TEMPORARY MONITOR AND. THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS. WAYS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN TAKE. ACTION ON THE PLAN AND THEN THE OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS ARE CERTAINLY FAR MORE. YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR ENCOUNTER DATA OR WE WENT IN AND LOOKED AT YOUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHEN WE AUDITED YOU AND YOU HAD UPDATED YOUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND SO. DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY AND THAT. EITHER THE COMPLETE THE QUICK COMPLIANCE BY THE PLAN OR THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE KIND OF DETERMINES WHAT ARE ACTION IS DEPENDING ON THE PLANS REACTION AND SO. WE CAN MOVE ON QUICKLY OR WE CAN TAKE LONGER DEPENDING BUT I WOULD SAY USUALLY WHEN A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IS IMPOSED WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE SOMETHING. BACK USUALLY WITHIN THIRTY THIRTY DAYS IF IT SEE AND NON URGENT ISSUE ON MORE URGENT ISSUES WE REQUIRE AND SOMETIMES. GIVE US SOMETHING IN A WEEK. YOU KNOW SOMETHING MORE. MORE TIMELY. IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ADVOCATES IN THE FIRST PANEL AND I DON'T WANNA ADD MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE OF FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS AS WELL BUT. SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES FEEL FIRST HAND WHAT INADEQUATE NETWORKS LOOK LIKE. AND I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU DO YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED AS A DEPARTMENT. OR WHAT COULD WE AS A LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP WORK WITH YOU. TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH PLANS CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS. CAN DEVELOP AN ACCEPTABLE RATE OF COMPLIANCE. I THINK IT JENNIFER ALLUDED TO ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT BROADLY WHICH IS INVESTMENTS IN. AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE PROVIDER SHORTAGES SO THAT'S OUTSIDE OF BOTH OF OUR JURISDICTIONS BUT WE ASK OF THE COMETS AND JENNIFER MADE THAT WE. AS A STATE AS A A LARGER GROUP OF PEOPLE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE WE HAVE BOTH DOCUMENTED AREAS AND IN THE VERY RURAL AREAS THAT JENNIFER MENTIONED BUT ALSO. IN SOME URBAN AREAS WHERE PENETRATION OF CERTAIN PROVIDER TYPES IS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF IT OF AN URBAN POPULATION AND BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION CAN BE AN ISSUE THAT CONCRETE BARRIERS TO CARE WHICH. AREN'T REALLY OBVIOUS YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTY OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED IS AN OBVIOUS WHEN YOU'RE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF LOS ANGELES AS AN EXAMPLE. SO I I DEFINITELY THINK WORKING TOGETHER ON PROVIDERS SHORTAGE ISSUES IS AN AREA THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MENTION THAT WITH PROP FIFTY SIX WE HAD PLACED MONEY AND FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND THAT MONEY COULD GREATLY HELP US MEET SOME OF THE NETWORK ADEQUACY ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING AS A STATE. AND WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO HELP US TO. WORK FOR THOSE FUNDS TO SEE HOW WE CAN. HELP TO INCREASE OUR NETWORK ADEQUACY. I JUST WANNA MAKE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. IT'S IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SIT UP HERE. AND AND JUST LISTEN TO YOU KNOW THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AYE WE'RE NOT BUILDING CARS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO DISTRESSING TO ME AND TO ALL OF US I CAN SENSE. THAT IT FEELS LIKE. SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY THE ACCOUNT ACCOUNTABILITY PART. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST IN ONE AREAS IN MULTIPLE AREAS AND IT'S. HARD FOR ME TO GO BACK. AND SPEAK TO MY CONSTITUENCY ABOUT WELL THIS. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY HERE. AND THEN A COUPLE MONTHS LATER THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP. ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. QUITE FRANKLY A CHRONIC PROBLEM. IN THIS AREA. DIET WE HAVE NO ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT YET. THE ANSWERS ARE THOSE THAT GET THE REQUEST THAT WE GET IS ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN NORMANDY WE CAN'T KEEP THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. IF THE ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED BECAUSE IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THEY WERE WASTING OUR MONEY AND AGAIN. THAT'S UP HERE BUT ON THE ON THE GROUND THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED IN IT JUST SOMETIMES FEELS LIKE. THIS PLACE DOESN'T GET THAT. AND IN I DON'T WANT TO POINT FINGERS BY. QUITE FRANKLY THE DEPARTMENTS DON'T GET PACKED THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL PEOPLE REAL ISSUES BUT THE. YOU KNOW YOU YOU STATED THAT TWENTY OUT OF THE TWENTY THREE. OUR MEDICAL PLANS ARE ARE UNDER REVIEW THAT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. OF. I MEAN THAT'S CRAZY. YES THERE'S. DIFFERENT DEGREES OF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING UNDER REVIEW FROM BUT THE FACT IS THAT THAT'S WAY TOO MANY. THAT'S EIGHTY THREE PERCENT NOT FIFTY PERCENT AND. IT'S AGAIN IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE HE'S A REAL PEOPLE. THESE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS AND IT'S SENT AND I. WISH THAT THERE WAS AWAY IN THAT WE CAN KIND OF GET THAT MESSAGE TO THE DEPARTMENTS THAT THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE WERE AFFECTING. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU DON'T. IN A CERTAIN UNDERSTAND BUT WHAT I'M NOT GETTING IS WHAT WE DOING ABOUT IT AND EVERY TIME THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE BRING UP. THERE'S ALWAYS WERE DOING THIS WOULDN'T SO WERE PLAYING CATCH UP ALL THE TIME WHAT IS IT. AND THIS IS JUST FOR LATER WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GUYS CAN DO TWO CATS THIS INSTEAD OF A WHISTLEBLOWER. INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW. COMING UP HERE AND ASKING US TO HELP CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE TO PREVENT A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS FROM FROM APPEARING. IT'S IT'S AGAIN IT'S VERY. DIFFICULT WHEN WERE ASKED FOR MORE BUDGET FOR MORE MONEY FOR THIS OR FOR THAT. WHEN THE MONEY THAT YOU HAVE IS NOT BEING USED PROPERLY AND IT'S NOT YOU BY THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE IS NOT THERE SO THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY. THAT. WHEN WE NEED FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. I. I'M I'M A JUMP IN HERE. IT IS A THINK IT'S GOOD GOES MARK TO. THAT THE SYSTEM IS FAILING. I NAY IN IN JANUARY AT TALKING A LITTLE GIRL IN MY DISTRICT DIED. BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SHE HAD A FLUAND YET ANOTHER INFECTION. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT HURT SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IT TAKES OVER A WEEK. TO GET IN TO SEE A DOC. AND THERE'S SEVERAL ISSUES GOING ON. AND WHAT CONCERNS ME IS ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE. A LACK OF PROVIDERS. SELECT YOUR SPEAK PLAIN ENGLISH THAT'S ALL LACK OF DOCTORS. THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT OF MOVE THROUGH. THESE HOUSES THE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS MANAGED TO GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK TO GET SIGNED. THAT'S A PROBLEM. THE FACT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SYSTEM. SO. WE WE HAVE THE PLANS SO ONE PROVIDER COULD BE TAKE ALL THE PLANS COULD TAKE ONE. HOUSE THAT BEAM CANNON HOUSE THAT BEING ADJUSTED FOR. BECAUSE IF ALL THE PLANS ARE USING THREE DIFFERENT DOCTORS THAT ONE DOCTOR'S I CAN BE ABLE SEE EVERYBODY THIS IS NOT DOESN'T ADD UP. A AND I HOPE THAT GOD THERE'S SOME BETTER MATH OUT THERE TO DRESS THIS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS. FUNDAMENTALLY FELLING. OR PEOPLE AND THEY'RE DYING ON THE COLD STREETS. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS. THE NETWORKS ARE WORKING IN THE THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM. FILLING THESE PEOPLE. IN AND WE'RE RESPONSIBILITY THAT. IN THIS HALF TO GET ADDRESSED. WITH. I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES SAY YOU CAN JUST THROW MONEY AT THE PROBLEM EVERY YEAR WE COME BACK IN ITS. WE NEED MORE MONEY TO DO THIS SO WE CAN MONITOR THIS AND WE CAN. THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT INTEL THE SYSTEM ITSELF MECHANICS WITHIN THAT SYSTEM GET FIXED. WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK HERE BEING IN OUR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL. WITH LITTLE GIRLS DYING ON THE STREET IN I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. SO WHEN WE COME BACK IN MAY. POLL LEASE AYE I KNOW EVERYBODY EFFORT WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU ON ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM. FUNCTION THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE DOING TO TAKE OUR PEOPLE. I'LL HAVE TO LAST QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL BE FINISHED WITH THIS ISSUE. WE HEARD ABOUT THE. A NECESSITY TO HAVE PLANS EXHAUST THEIR APPEAL PROCESS. SURE. BENEFICIARIES SORRY TO EXHAUST THE APPEALS PROCESS AND WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND IF THAT'S IN THE BESTEST INTEREST OF THE BENEFICIARIES OR WHAT FURTHER WE CAN DO TO FIGURE OUT AN APPEALS PROCESS THAT INSURED WE. WERE HEARING FROM PEOPLE AND WHY I'M ASKING ABOUT THAT. AGAIN COMING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OFTENTIMES OUR. THAT CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT HIDE IN THE SHADOWS HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO COME OUT. AND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER OUR APPEALS PROCESS IS WORKS FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE IT'S ACTUALLY A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT. AS PART OF THE MANAGE CARE FINAL RULE THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN MAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN IT DID BECOME A REQUIREMENT THAT WE EXHAUSTED THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL PRIOR TO A BENEFICIARY BEING ABLE TO GO TO A STATE FAIR HEARING. BUT I'M AND YOU CAN SPEAK TO SO THAT OUR HELP CENTER GENERALLY SPEAKING TO DO A FORMAL COMPLAINT THAT IS AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE AN EARLY ISSUE WHERE YOU NEED ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. WE RESOLVE IT WE DON'T WE DON'T FORCE GENERALLY TO GO BACK INTO A THIRTY DAY GRIEVANCE PROCESS WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER THAT THREE WAY PHONE CALL. WHERE ONE OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES WILL GET THE PLAN ON THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE AVAILABLE TO US TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY? AND WE WILL HAVE THE EARLY ON THE PHONE CALL WE WILL RESOLVE IT IN IN THAT PHONE CALL OR IF WE HAVE TO MAKE TO FOLLOW UP WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT RESOLVE IT QUICKLY. AND GET IN ROLE THAT WE WILL EITHER OFFERS TO GO TO ANOTHER NETWORK PROVIDER IF THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO OR. GET THAT AND REALLY IN TWO AND A REASONABLE APPOINTMENT FOR AN IN NETWORK PROVIDER SO. IF IT'S A FORMAL COMPLAINT LIKE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. MY COST SHARING WAS APPROPRIATE. APPLIED AND I WANT THAT TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PLANT YES SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST JUST AS SARAH DESCRIBED IN THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IT'S THE SAME PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH THE THIRTY DAY. BUT IF IT'S URGENT. IF IT'S ACCESS DOZER TYPICALLY HANDLED IN AND THE QUICK RESOLUTION FASHION THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT DIRECTOR CAN'T HAS SAID THERE'S THREE WAYS WE CAN AFFECT A COST AND HEALTH CARE IT'S IT'S PEOPLE. UP PROGRAMS AND RATES PEOPLE BENEFITS AND RATE. ONE OF THE. STRUGGLES I HAVE IS GETTING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ACTUAL RATES ARE. THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO OUR PROVIDERS. AND AM WONDERING HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GAINING THAT INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF THE LACK OF NETWORK ADEQUACY. HIS COMING FROM THE PROVIDER RATES. OR. WHERE WE ARE STRUGGLING TO ATTAIN? THE NETWORK ADEQUACY IS THAT ARE NEEDED AND HOW CAN WE ATTAIN THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT MAY MEAN THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT PROP FIFTY SIX AND FIGURE OUT IF WE NEED TO HAVE. POLAND SOME FUNDS TO ACTUALLY. DIRECT THE MONEY TO ENSURE NETWORK ADEQUACY IF THE RATES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF GRANULARITY IN DETAIL. AND I'M ASKING YOU HOW CAN WE GET THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL SO THAT WE CAN. HELP TO ASSIST. YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT. THE. THE CONTRACTING SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS AND PLAY. WE HAVE MEDICAL PROVIDERS THAT CAN BE CONTRACTING WITH HEALTH PLANS THEY CAN ALSO BE. SEEN FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS FEE FOR SERVICES A SET RATE RIGHT IT'S A CLAIM SYSTEM WE PUT IN A CLAIM WE. PAY OUT THE RATE THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED SO THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. PLANS HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE A SENSE OF BUT SOME OF WHICH WE DON'T. SOME. CONTRACTS WITH HEALTH PLANS WILL PAVE PHYSICIANS ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. SOME. PLANS WILL PAY PHYSICIANS ON A CAPITATED BASIS SOME PHYSICIANS WILL GET PAID WITH A MIX MEANING WILL. YOU KNOW WILL CAPITA YOU FOR PRIME MAKE PRIMARY CARE AND WE'LL PAY YOU SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR OTHER THINGS. THERE'S A LOT OF. PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AND AS YOU WOULD KNOW THAT HELPS KIND OF. CHANGE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN PROVIDERS YOU HAVE MEDICAL GROUPS THAT YOU KNOW NEGOTIATE RATES ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THEIR PROVIDERS WITHIN THEIR NETWORK. I DON'T THINK THAT ANY ONE SITTING IN ANY ONE OF OUR CHAIRS EITHER AT THE DEPARTMENT AT. ARE YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT MINUTES HEALTH CARE US HAVE ANY KIND OF COMPLETE AND TOTAL TRANSPARENCY AND HOW THOSE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE. I WOULD ONLY KNOW ABOUT MEDI CAL I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT IS ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AND SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF KIND OF LAYERS OF TRANSPARENCY THAT I KNOW. THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO GET AT YOU KNOW GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THOSE HAVE. ALSO BEEN. NOT SUCCESSFUL AND SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE PLANS TO SET YOU KNOW WE NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE PLANS AND WHEN I SAY NEGOTIATE WE DON'T REALLY. NEGOTIATE AS WE TAKE THEIR ENCOUNTER DATA AND THEIR COSTS IN THEIR UTILIZATION OUR ACTUARIES TREND THAT. AND THEN WE GIVE THE PLANS RATE AND SAY THIS IS WHAT YOUR RATE'S GOING TO BE FOR THIS ELIGIBILITY CATEGORY IN THE GIVEN YEAR. AND THEY CAN DISPUTE WHETHER WE HAVE A. AND I MATH ERROR YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T THINK YOU CALCULATED THIS TREND OR WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU TRENDED IT. BUT. OUR ENTIRE RATES PROCESS IS BASED ON A PLANS ACTUAL ON ENCOUNTER COSTS UTILIZATION DATA. SO IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT AND IT'S HARD TO KIND OF TELL IT THAT MUCH MORE KIND OF. LARGER LEVEL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAMAGE SEE DOES IN THEIR FINANCIAL AUDITS BUT IF THE COMMERCIAL RATES ARE EVEN HARDER TO ASSESS. I WOULD AGREE WITH JENNIFER WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER RATES PAID OR INDIVIDUAL CAPITATED OVER A RATES PAID WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO IS THE OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ABOUT THE PLANTS AND THE MEDICAL GROUPS FOR ABOUT WITH. WITH TO WHOM THEY DELEGATE RISK SO WE HAVE A GOOD PICTURE OF HOW THEY'RE DOING FINANCIALLY WHICH IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO CATCH THE ISSUE. THAT THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED EARLIER WITH ONE OF THE PLANTS THAT WE BOTH HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH BUT WE ALSO. RECEIVE MEDICAL US RADIO RATIO IT. INFORMATION FROM THE PLAN SO THEY HAVE TO DOCUMENT FOR THE PREMIUM THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING WHAT HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING TO MEDICAL CARE. AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING TO ADMINISTRATION PROFIT AND THERE'S DIFFERENT STANDARDS SET FOR MARKET TYPE SO ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IT'S EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR PREMIUM. MUST GO TO MEDICAL CARE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND RELATED INITIATIVES. ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP SIDE IT'S EIGHTY PERCENT AND SO WE PERIODICALLY CONDUCT EXAMS WE GO ONSITE WE LOOK AT THE MEDICAL RECORDS. AND THE DE DIFFERENT. OR READ NOT MEDICAL RECORDS BUT WE LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS OF THE PLAN IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THAT THEY YES HAVE CATEGORIZED ALL THE EXPENSES CORRECTLY TO TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SPENDING. THE EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT THAT THE REQUIRED TO SPEND BUT WE DO WE DO NOT GET IN ANY CAPACITY THE GRANULARITY OF FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. CLAIM OR AN INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER THAT THIS IS HOW MUCH THAT PERSONS BEING PAID WE SEE THEIR CONTRACT. IN KIND OF AN AGGREGATE WITHOUT NUMBERS IN IT SO WE ENSURE THAT THE DIFFERENT PROVIDER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ENSHRINED IN THE KNOX KY DOCTORED HERE TOO SO THAT HAS TO DO WITH. HOW THEY RECOUP PAYMENTS THE TIMELINESS OF MAKING PAYMENTS WHETHER NOT ENTRANCED INTEREST IS PAID ON LATE PAYMENTS THAT SORT OF THING BUT NOT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT WE DON'T RECEIVE ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE? AND I PROMISED THAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. BUT DO WANT TO. WORK WITH BOTH OF YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE NEW DATA COLLECTION AND IF IT PROVIDES US SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE SEEKING. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE UPON IT AND INSIST THAT WE ARE COLLECTING TIMELY DATA. AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE MEETING OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTY IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SEE EVERYONE FROM THE SEATS ARE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE SO. I GET A MARK TO GREEN. THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THIRTY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR MISSION EARLIER NOW TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION HOW WE'RE STRUCTURED. OUT SO WE LICENSE AND REGULATE. APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HEALTH PLANS THAT PROVIDE COVERAGE TO MORE THAN TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT'S BROKEN DOWN BETWEEN THE FULL SERVICE HEALTH PLANS THAT WERE OVERLY FAMILIAR WITH AS WELL AS DENTAL VISION AND OTHER SPECIALIZED PLANS. AND WE REGULATE APPROXIMATELY NINETY TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. ARE PROPOSED TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET IS SEVENTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION WHICH IS A DECREASE WHICH YOU PROBABLY DON'T HEAR THAT VERY OFTEN THAT IT IS IN FACT A DECREASE. OF APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION OR ONE POINT TWO PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT YEAR SPENDING AUTHORITY AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS. I WE ARE SPECIALLY FUNDED WE RECEIVE NO GENERAL FUND AND WE ARE SPECIFICALLY FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS PAID BY HEALTH PLANS. SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MAJOR% PROGRAMS ARE COVER THE FIRST IS THE HELP CENTER I TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. BUT IT WORKS TO EDUCATE ASSIST CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE RIGHTS PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS HELP CONSUMERS NAVIGATING UNDERSTAND THE COVERAGE. AND ENSURES ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SINCE TWO THOUSAND OUR HELP CENTER HAS ASSISTED MORE THAN TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AND ISSUES WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS. SUCH AS THE TYPES WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER COVERAGE DISPUTES ACCESS TO PROVIDERS AND BILLING ISSUES. OUR OFFICE A PLAN LICENSING. ALL HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR AND MAINTAIN A LICENSE TO OPERATE. THE DAMAGE SEE REVIEWS ALL ASPECTS THE PLANT'S OPERATIONS INCLUDING BENEFITS AND COVERAGE THE CONTRACTS WITH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS IN THAT TEMPLATE FORM THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. PROVIDER NETWORKS AND COMPLAINING GRIEVANCE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LOCKED. OUR OFFICE OF PLAN MONITORING ASSESSES AND MONITORS HEALTH KICK UP HEALTH PLAN CARE AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR LAW. WITHIN THAT OFFICER DIVISION A PLAN SURVEYS PERFORMS ROUTINE AND NON ROUTINE SURVEYS WHICH ARE KIND OF LIKE FUNCTIONAL AUDITS. OF OUR LICENSE HOPE PLANS TO ENSURE THEY MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND CONSUMER IT'S GET ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. OUR DIVISION OF PROVIDER NETWORKS MONITORS THE PROVIDER NETWORKS AND ACCESSIBILITY OF SERVICES REVIEWS ANNUAL HEALTH PLAN TIMELY ACCESS COMPLIANCE REPORTS THAT REVERTED TALKED ABOUT TODAY. AND CONDUCTS ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REVIEW REVIEWS OF ALL FULL SERVICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NETWORKS. OUR OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REVIEW I'M WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF HEALTH PLANS MEDICAL GROUPS THROUGH REGULAR REPORTING FINANCIAL AUDITS AND OTHER MONITORING TOOLS. AYE WE ALSO RECEIVE THE ANNUAL MEDICAL US RATIO FILINGS THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER IS TO ENSURE THAT PLANTS ARE APPROPRIATELY INVESTING IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND. WE ALSO HAVE A RATE REVIEW PROGRAM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKET. WE DON'T APPROVE RATES BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THEM FOR JUSTIFICATION AND REASONABLENESS AND THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH HEALTH PLANS WHEN RATE FILINGS HAVE COME IN THAT HAVEN'T MET THAT STANDARD. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE CALIFORNIANS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. LASTLY OUR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT WE OBSERVE A WIDE VARIETY OF TOOLS TO ENFORCE THE LAW WOULD VIOLATIONS ARE UNCOVERED CORRECTION WE ALSO USE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WHEN WE TAKE IT ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL MATTER AGAINST A PLAN FINANCIAL PENALTIES CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS ARE FREEZING ROMANCE AND INSTALLATION OF MONITORS AND AS. THE DH CEASED DE HTS DIRECTOR DESCRIBED THE CONSERVATORSHIP OF A PLAN THAT'S ONE OF OUR MOST AGGRESSIVE. SO THAT'S THE OVER GET THE DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ONLY COMES. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIXTEEN. XENON OUT A BRING IT UP HERE JUST FOR A QUICK COMMENT IT SEEMS STRANGE TO BE DECREASING THE BUDGET THAT'S PROVIDING THE OVERSIGHT IN LIGHT OF. SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD IN THE LAST ISSUE. AND SO I'M. WONDERING IF LESS OVERSIGHT AND LAST FINANCES ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME AND WAS HOPING THAT PARK COMMENT ON CERTAINLY SO IT ACTUALLY JUST A FUNCTION OF TIMING WE HAD A NUMBER OF PRAYER YOUR BCP'S OR PROVE THAT HAD LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO ALLOW US TO STAND UP NEW PROGRAMS. THAT WERE REQUIRED UNDER PRIOR LEGISLATION AND SO IT'S THOSE IF THE EXPIRATION OF A WIDE VARIETY OF LIMITED TERM RESOURCES BECAUSE WE'VE STOOD UP THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE SHORT TERM SO. IT'S JUST A FUNCTION OF TIME A GREAT. WITH THAT. STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED NO ACTION AT THIS TIME WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. OKAY SHOULD SEVENTEEN AS OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE CONVERSION OF LIMITED FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY COMPLIANCE REVIEW RESOURCES INTO PERMANENT. SO THE PAUL WELLSTONE TO PETE DOMINICI MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THAT IS ALSO A MOUTHFUL. REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO CLASSIFY BENEFITS IN THE FEDERALLY MANDATED CLASSIFICATIONS SUCH AS INPATIENT AND NETWORK INPATIENT OUT OF NETWORK EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WANTS ALL THE BENEFITS ARE CLASSIFIED PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS I ELECT COST SHARING IN COPAYS. AND QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT LIMITATIONS. FOR. ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE OR NOT MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES PLANS TO ENSURE THAT ANY NON QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT LIMITATIONS APPLY COMPATIBLE PROCESSES STRATEGIES AND STANDARDS ON BOTH SIDES SO IT'S IT'S AT THE ENTIRE. RULE% IS IT IS DESIGNED TO HELP. LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN MEDICAL SURGICAL BENEFITS AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE BENEFITS. LIMITED TERM FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND WAS INITIALLY GRANTED FOR TWO YEARS IN A FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BC. THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THIS BODY OF WORK THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THIS. BCP AND THAT FUNDING IS SET TO EXPIRE IN JUNE SO THIS REQUEST IS TO TAKE THAT EXISTING LIMITED CONVERT IT INTO PERMANENT ONGOING FUNDING. WHICH WILL ALLOW OUR CLINICAL CONSULTANTS TO CONTINUE TO ASSIST OUR OUR OFFICE A PLAN LICENSING IN COMPLAINTS REVIEWS WHEN A NEW PLAN COMES INTO THE MARKET SO. THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAD SOME NEW MARKET ENTRANTS WHICH IS A GOOD THING AS A MORE PLANS IS A GOOD THING. AND THEN ALSO WE'VE HAD PLANS THAT ADD NEW MARKET SEGMENT SO MAYBE THERE ARE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BUT THEY'RE EXPANDING INTO THE SMALL GROUP MARKET. THEY'VE BEEN IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET BUT THEY'RE GETTING INTO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET SO WHEN THEY MAKE THAT MARKET ADJUSTMENT THOSE PRODUCT DESIGNS LOOK VERY VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND SO THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH A NEW REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT FOR THAT MARKET SEGMENT WITH THAT BENEFIT DESIGN THAT THEY'VE GOT. EQUITY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT. COST SHARING AND A NON QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT LIMITATIONS. SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL REVIEW TWENTY EIGHT COMPLEX AND EIGHTY FOCUS MENTAL HEALTH PARITY FILINGS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND THERE ARE NO POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA OPENING COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN. CAN REALLY TELL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE SUPPORT THE DEMAND TO USE WORK IN IMPLEMENTING FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND SUPPORT THIS PETITION PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVENTEEN OPEN AT THIS TIME IN THE BOND ISSUE EIGHTEEN. ISSUE EIGHTEEN RELATES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATE BILL SEVENTEEN WHICH IS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS TRANSPARENCY. SO UPSET ABOUT SEVENTEEN ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE HIGH PRICES FOR PER CAPTION DROPS BY CREATING GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN DRUG PRICING. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF REQUIREMENTS IN S. B. SEVENTEEN RELATED TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH I WON'T BE DISCUSSING TODAY BUT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR DEPARTMENT. WHAT WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING WITH HEALTH PLANS SO WHAT THE? IT WHAT IS REQUIRED SB SEVENTEEN RELATED TO HEALTH PLAN REPORTING IS THAT. PLANTS REPORTS THAT IMAGE SEAT THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS. THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY DRUGS AS CATEGORIZED BY TOTAL ANNUAL PLAN SPEND AND THEN TWENTY FIVE DRUGS WITH THE HIGHEST YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING. HEALTH PLANS MUST REPORT THIS DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT BY OCTOBER FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. WE WILL ISSUE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH AGGREGATE DATA BEGINNING ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. S. B. SEVENTEEN ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LARGE GROUP MARKET SAID THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO SELL COVERAGE TO EMPLOYERS OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE. SUCH AS THE PREMIUM THE PERCENT OF PREMIUM ATTRIBUTABLE TO DRUG COSTS FOR EACH CATEGORY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FOR EXAMPLE GENERIC BRAND NAME. BY BRAND NAME SPECIALTY GENERICS SPECIALTY. AND YET THEY YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE AND A PER MEMBER PER MONTH COST FOR EACH OF THOSE FOUR CATEGORIES ALREADY DESCRIBED. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN PER MEMBER PER MONTH COSTS FOR DRUG PRICES COMPARED TO OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS SO AS IT COMPARES TO LIKE. DOCTORS RIGHT SO HOW MUCH HOW MUCH IS IN PROVIDER PAYMENTS HOW MUCH IS ON DRUGS. A SPECIALTY TEAR FORMULARY LIST. THE PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM ATTRIBUTED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ADMINISTERED INSIDE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OF THIS IS WHEN YOU GET AN INJECTION INSIDER DOCTOR'S THAT'S ADMINISTERED INSIDE THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE THAT'S PRESCRIBED THAT'S PART OF THE MEDICAL BENEFIT SINCE IT'S AN. AN OUT PATIENT CITING AS SEPARATE FROM THE FAR PHARMACY BENEFIT IF AVAILABLE SO WE UNDERSTAND WHERE SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES ARE. AND INFORMATION ON THE USE OF A PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER IN IF ANY INCLUDING WHICH COMPONENTS OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE ARE MANAGED BY THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER VERSUS THE PLAN. SO I WON'T GET INTO THE GREAT DETAILS ABOUT ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE WITH THE OFFICES THAT WOULD HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SO FOR OUR PIECE. WE ARE REQUESTING ONE PERMANENT POSITION AND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE SAME AMOUNT ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO ADDRESS THE INCREASEDWORKLOAD RELATED TO THE SPELL.
