THAT PROFESSION I GUESS THAT

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.259
MIGHT NOT BE A BAD.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:27.195
THING TO DO -- BUT THEY WILL BE

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.563
PREPARING TWO DISTINCTLY

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:29.731
DIFFERENT TAX RETURNS ONE FOR

FIVE FORTY CONFORMITY WHICH USED

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:37.371
TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS JUST

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:39.107
PULLING OUT THE AMOUNT YOU PAID

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.278
LONG GUN.

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.380
BUT THIS BILL IS A TAX INCREASE

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:47.515
THAT WILL GENERATE AN

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.584
ANTICIPATED ONE POINT SEVEN

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:50.918
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.320

IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:13.274

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.877
LEGISLATION THIS HAS NOT GONE

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.912
THROUGH GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE.

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.614

HAD SOME PUBLIC DISCUSSION --

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:23.818
BUT IT IS NOW JUST GOING QUICKLY

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:25.753
THROUGH BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.955
AS A TRAILER BILL.

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:30.458

GENERATE FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:09.997
JUST BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER THEY

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:14.068

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:14.669
