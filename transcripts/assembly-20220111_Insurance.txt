ELEVENTH. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. INSURANCE COMMITTEE HEARING. IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY. WE ONE BILL ON THE AGENDA IT IS- AB THREE NINE NINE BY MISTER SALAS MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE PRESENTING THAT BILL. WE WON'T VOTE OBVIOUSLY UNTIL WE HAVE A QUORUM. BUT LET'S GO AHEAD. AND GET UNDER WAY. GO AHEAD MR GRAYSON THANK YOU MITER CHAIR CHAIR A CHAIR DALY CHERRY MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THREE NINE NINE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS. IT DOES ALLOW AN INJURED EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK WHICH IS M. P. N. NAME AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FROM THEIR EMPLOYER IN INSTANCES WHERE THE EMPLOYER OBJECTS TO AN INJURED EMPLOYEES SELECTION OF A POSITION ON THE GROUNDS. THAT THE POSITION IS NOT WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK USED BY THE EMPLOYER. LAMES ADMINISTRATORS CAN UTILIZE THOUSANDS OF INDIANS WITH MOST IDENTIFIED BY NAME ONLY WHICH OFTENTIMES LOOK AND SOUND IDENTICAL. FOR AN INJURED WORKER THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SELECTED POSITION FALLS WITHIN A PARTICULAR MPN IF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE THIS ALONE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR AN INJURED WORKER. TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DOCTOR WITHIN THE PROPER MPN WHICH CAN RESULT IN DELAYS TO ACCESSING CRITICAL TREATMENT. THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW INJURED WORKERS TO IDENTIFY A NETWORK POSITION AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE AN EMPLOYER WITHHOLDS THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES FOR THE BASIS OF AN INJURED WORKER TO BE TREATED. OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK THIS COMMONSENSE FIX WILL PROVIDE INJURED WORKERS AND PHYSICIANS WITH ACCESS TO CRITICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NAME AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. TESTIFYING VIA TELEPHONE LINES IS DR JACOB ROSENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY. THIS BILL DOES HAVE NO OPPOSITION AND HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED AMONG STAKEHOLDERS MISTER BRIDGEMAN THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND TAKE ROLE NOW TO ESTABLISH OUR QUORUM.

SO LET'S GO LET'S SEE OF FOR MR. ROSENBERG MISTER ROSENBERG OF ROSENBERG DR ROSENBERG LET'S SEE IF HE'S ON THE LINE. HELLO GOOD GO AHEAD SIR I AM ON THE LINE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. IT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THIS IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL IT'S JUST GOING TO HELP- POSITIONS DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE THE RIGHT POSITION TO- TREATING INJURED WORKER WHETHER WE'RE IN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK AND IF WE'RE NOT IN THE- RIGHT MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK. TO HELP GET THEM TO- TO PROVIDERS THE THAT IS IN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK- RIGHT NOW THERE'S A THERE'S A BRIGHTER PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR IF- IF. THE PATIENT CHOOSES THE POSITION IS OUTSIDE THE MPN- BUT- MAJOR ISSUES THE TREATMENT GETS DELAYED AND THAT OF COURSE MEANS THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET BACK TO WORK. AND THAT'S QUITE PROBLEMATIC- DELAYING TREATMENT SOMETIMES RESULTS IN MORE OF A SIGNIFICANT INJURIES AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY WIND UP WITH THE RIGHT POSITION RIGHT AWAY. SADLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN THE FIRST PACIFIC MPM THAT THE WORKERS IN- A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF MULTIPLE MTN'S- WITH SIMILAR SOUNDING NAMES. THAT YOU THINK THAT POSITION WOULD KNOW EVERY EMPTY AND THAT THEIR END BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT WE- WE HAVE A HARD TIME IDENTIFYING THE DIFFERENT MPN SYNCING WHICH ONCE RAN AS WELL. SO THIS WOMAN SOME CLARITY TO A SITUATION AND HELP THE INJURED WORKERS GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK MORE QUICKLY. WE NEGOTIATED VERY CAREFULLY- WITH THE PAYERS BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT ANY UNDUE BURDEN ON THEM AND THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THAT THIS BILL WAS WORTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR ROSENBERG.
