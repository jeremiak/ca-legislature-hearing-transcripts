NOW WE WILL BEGIN OUR OVERVIEW HEARING. SO THIS IS OUR FIRST OUR FORMAL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING OF THE YEAR AND OUR PURPOSE IS TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA- ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ISSUED AS PER THE CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENT FOR THE- TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET NOW THAT BUDGET AS EVERYONE KNOWS IS ONE THAT WE WILL BY CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION ADOPTED BY JUNE FIFTEENTH HOWEVER THERE ARE ITEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S. WOULD LIKE US TO ACT ON EARLIER SO THOSE WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED JUST AS INFORMATION NOT WE WILL NOT BE TAKING VOTES TODAY SO WE WILL GET AN OVERVIEW NOT ONLY ON THE FULL BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT ON THE- EARLIER SO IMMEDIATE ACTION AND- SHORTER TERM ACTION ITEMS THAT THE- GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE. HAS PROPOSED. SO ADDITIONALLY THIS OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES WILL BEGIN THEIR HEARINGS EARLIER THAN NORMAL AND THE REASON THEY ARE DOING SO IS BOTH BECAUSE WE ARE CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF COMMITTEE ROOM SPACE SO WE ARE ADVANCING THE PROCESS WE CAN MAKE SURE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW OUR SUBCOMMITTEES TO HAPPIER HEARINGS BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVETHESE EARLY ACTION ITEMS AT THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST IT SO SUBCOMMITTEE ONE ANSEM COMMITTEE FOR WILL HAVE. ARE SCHEDULED TO HAVE HEARINGS NEXT WEEK OUR OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES WILL START THEIR REGULAR WORK IN FEBRUARY. NOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT HE ISSUED LAST ON FRIDAY REFLECTS THAT THE REVENUE COLLECTIONS IN OUR STATE TO DATE. ANY UPDATED FORECAST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. THAN WAS FORECAST WHEN WE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET LAST JUNE. SANDY ARE PROPOSAL FOR BOTH THE FULL TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET AS WELL AS SOME OF THE MORE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING TO QUICKLY DEPLOY RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE TO. SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS SUPPORT RENTERS PUT AND PUT ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND ENHANCE AND ACCELERATE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. ARE PARTLY MOTIVATED FROM THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE THESE- THIS ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAN WAS EXPECTED WHEN WE ADOPTED IN JUNE. NOW ONE ISSUE WE WILL BE CONSIDERING IS HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ALIGN WITH THE NOT ONLY THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO THE RECENT ACTION IN DECEMBER OF CONGRESS FOR A ECOND. CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT THAT'S THE LAST TIME TO SAY ALL THOSE WORDS I'M GONNA JUST SAY CURES ACT FROM NOW ON- SO FAR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WILL BE PRESENTING TO US IN THIS OVERVIEW HEARING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE WILL BE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FROM THAT RECENT FEDERAL CARES ACT SO THAT WE CAN CONSIDER IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER EXPENDITURES WE'RE BEING ASKED TO MAKE USING JUST STATE FUNDS. ON THEN I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WE MEANING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN THIS CURRENT AND GOOD FISCAL POSITION PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE OF THE STOCK MARKET. AND THE ECONOMY FUNCTIONING A LITTLE BETTER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED BECAUSE OF THE FIRST FEDERAL CARES ACT ACTION WHICH PUT DOLLARS DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS. OF FAMILIES AND ALSO MANY BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY THOUGH CALIFORNIA STATE REVENUES ARE IN GOOD FISCAL SITUATION BECAUSE FOR THE LAST DECADE WE THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND VOTERS HAVE PUT INTO PLACE MANY VERY. EFFECTIVE AND VALUABLE MEASURES SUCH AS THE DIFFERENT RESERVES THE REQUIREMENT TO BUILD THOSE RESEARCH. ON THE PAYING DOWN STRUCTURAL DEBT OVER THE LAST X. AMOUNT OF YEARS AND SOME TAX CHANGES AND THOSE ARE. A AND THOSE WERE ALL DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE RECESSION AND HAVE HELPED US GREATLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO HELP US GREATLY. NO NOT WITHSTANDING THIS IMPROVED FISCAL POSITION AS THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTED IN HIS INITIAL PROPOSAL WHICH WE WILL AGAIN HERE TODAY. THE RECOVERY IS ALL OF US KNOW HAS BEEN AN EQUAL. AND HAS EXASPERATED EXACERBATED INEQUALITIES IN OUR STATE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY. SEVERELY IMPACTING MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND WITH THE LATEST DATA STRONGLY POINTING TO WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY BEING THE MOST HARD HIT ECONOMICALLY. SO AS WE- DELIBERATE ON NOT ONLY THE LONG TERM BUDGET ACTIONS BUT THE SHORT TERM I THINK WE WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SERVE THOSE WHO REALLY NEED ASSISTANCE TO SUSTAIN THEM THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. BUT TO ALSO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A RESILIENT AND VIABLE ECONOMY GOING FORWARD- SO. AS IS OUR PRACTICE WE WILL HEAR FIRST WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THEY'RE BOTH PROMOTE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SO BEFORE WE GO TO THEM TO PRESENT LET ME TURN TOWARD VICE CHAIR. SENATOR NIELSEN AND SEE IF HE HAS ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. GLAD TO HAVE YOU ALL SERVING ON THIS HARDEST WORKING OF ALL THE COMMITTEES AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND UNDERSTAND IT IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY. IN THE BECAUSE OF TRAILER BILLS AND OTHER MATTERS SO MUCH POLICY IS NOW DONE IN THE BUDGET. SO WE HAVE A DUAL RESPONSIBILITY AS POLICY AS WELL AS BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS. IT'S A BUDGET THAT IS FOCUSED ON SOME OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. IT IS ALSO A BUDGETS GOING REQUIRE CAREFUL SCRUTINY. AND CARE AS WE MOVE FORWARD COULD NOT BE BUILDING AT THE BASE. BECAUSE I WOULD ARGUE. OUR EXTRA MONEY I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT SURPLUS. IS TENUOUS WE'VE EXPLAINED WHY I SUPPOSE WITH THAT THE CHAIR HAS IN TERMS OF- AND THEN ANALYZING WHAT THIS SO CALLED EXTRA MONEY MAY BE. BUT AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS. WE'VE GOT TO BE CAUTIOUS. AND AGAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL KEY. IS TO FOCUS ON BUDGET BUILDING BASE BUILDING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING OFF TO A- GOOD START. THANK YOU. FOR NOW WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BY ERICA LEVY WHO IS THE NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISLEAD CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO GET THE PRESENTATION UP SO THAT WE CAN ALL SEE AT. OKAY GOOD MORNING JERRY SKINNER AYE STERN NIELSEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ERICA EACH THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN THANK YOU FOR THAT THE OPPORTUNITY OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I'M SORRY THE CHAIR GAVE A PREVIEW OF. THE FIRST PART OF MY PRESENTATION- SO I'LL GO THROUGH THAT QUICKLY THE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK HAS DRASTICALLY CHANGED SINCE THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT AND IMPROVE REVENUES ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE COMMON NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND MAKE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUPPORTS A BROAD BASED ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PROPOSES ACCELERATING MANY INVESTMENTS INTO EARLY ACTION TO CREATE JOBS AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THE PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THE COMPANY IS DOING WELL RIGHT NOW BUT NOT EVERYONE IS DOING WELL WE HAVE REVENUES UP DRAMATICALLY- AT THE PARK THE BUDGET FORECAST A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT BILLION WHICH IS UP TWENTY NINE BILLION FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS. COME DOWN FROM A PEAK OF SIXTEEN POINT 4% BACK IN APRIL AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY DOWN EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT- WELL THIS IS GOOD OBVIOUSLY THAT PRETTY RECESSION RATE WAS THREE POINT NINE PERCENT- AND AGAIN FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS. ARE STILL RECEIVING SOME FORM AND YOU AYE BENEFIT AND LESS THAN HALF OF THE JOBS THAT WE'VE LOST SINCE FEBRUARY HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. IMPROVE REVENUE. THE BIG IMPROVE REVENUE PICTURE IS REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THE TOTAL BUT THE TOTAL BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES ARE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION OF WHICH A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION IS GENERAL FUND- WE FORECAST A ONE TIME SURPLUS OF FIFTEEN MILLION- THE L. A. O. CALLS THIS WINDFALL- FOR EXTRA MONEY AS VICE CHAIR NELSON HAVE SIDE- BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO BUILD BUDGETARY RESILIENCY SO WE'VE SET ASIDE TWENTY TWO BILLION IN TOTAL RESERVES AND THAT REALLY HELPED TO PROTECT THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND OTHER SERVICES LEADING INTO THE RECESSION WAS HAVING A STRONG RESEARCH. AND PRUDENT MEASURES THAT WERE TAKEN PRIOR TO- THE COBIT RECESSION IN ADDITION- THE BUDGET PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION TOWARDS STATE RETIREMENT LIABILITIES AND THAT SIX POINT FIVE BILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS- IN RECOGNITION OF IMPROVE REVENUES WE HAVE SCHEDULED PROGRAMS EXPANSIONS THAT ARE DELAYED BY A YEAR- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS WEEK WE DO WE ARE FORECASTING OUT HERE OPERATING DEFICIT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING- ONE TIME VERSUS ON GOING- SO WELL WE DO HAVE A SURPLUS IN. THE BUDGET YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT- I HERE OPERATING. DEFICITS STARTING IN TWO TO THREE ABOUT POINT SIXTY. AND GROWING TO TWENTY FIVE OVER ELEVEN BILLION BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- SO AS I MENTIONED OPERATING DEFICITS WILL CONSTRAIN I'M GOING SPENDING SO MANY OF THE PROPOSAL THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS- OR INCLUDING THAT. FIFTEEN BILLION SURPLUS- ARE ONE TIME. AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE BUDGET DOES PROJECTS- THAT THE STATE APPROPRIATION LIMIT WILL BE EXCEEDED- BY A MODERATE AMOUNT ABOUT A HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS- ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THESE ARE NOT FINAL- PROJECTIONS WILL HAVE FINAL REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES IN THE SPRING AND WILL COME BACK TO THE BODY. WRITTEN A REVISION WITH UPDATED CALCULATIONS. THIRTY INCREASE REVENUES ARE DUE LARGELY TO THREE FACTORS AS THE CHAIR STATE AND- THE LESS SEVERE DOWNTURN IF IT IS A LOT OF THEIR DOWNTURN. LARGELY INTACT- BECAUSE OF FEDERAL STIMULUS THAT WAS PROVIDED EARLY LAST YEAR- ALSO THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ON EQUAL SPREAD OF WAGE NOT WAITING JOB LOSSES WHERE YOU SAW A LOT OF HIGHER INCOME WORKERS- WERE ABLE TO PASS THAT AND MOVE TO TELEWORK. AND LOWER INCOME WORKERS WERE NOT THE HIGHER WAGE WORKERS- IN OUR STATE PAY MORE IN TAXES THAN THAT REALLY HELP TO BUFFER THE REVENUE LOSSES THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW. BLACKARACHNIA BOXES AND THEN THIRDLY THE STOCK MARKET JUST HIT RECORD HIGHS AND THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO CAPITOL RECORDS CAPITAL GAINS. AGAIN BENEFITING HIGHER INCOME INDIVIDUALS SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- THERE HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS- I LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND THE BUDGET REALLY LOOKS TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ACCELERATE. AND JUMPSTART- ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH A FOCUS. ON THOSE MOST IMPACTED. GET OUT A LOT BECAUSE I IS A EIGHTEEN IN THIS BUT- I OF COURSE SPEAKING TO SOME OF THOSE PROPOSAL ARE ONE OF YOUR TIME TO THIS. SLIDE WHICH HIGHLIGHTS COST ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET FOR KOBE NINETEEN OR MERGING FEAR RESPONSE WERE ESTIMATING ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN ADDITIONAL COSTS SINCE THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET- IT. AND THIS IS FOR EFFORTS THAT INVOLVE VACCINES TO TESTING CONTACT TRACING FOOD BANKS- HOUSING COMMUNICATION AND OTHERS. THE BUDGET FOCUSES ON AN EQUITABLE AND BROAD BASED RECOVERY STARTING NOW AND AS- CHURCH GUNNER SAID THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING FOR IMMEDIATE BUDGET ACTION. AND THESE ARE THE FIVE PROPOSALS THAT ARE- WE WOULDASK FOR IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION- SOME OF WHICH YOU. OR ALL OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD OF- IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS- SO I'LL JUST QUICKLY GO THROUGH THEM. THE FIRST IS TO TYPICALLY REOPEN SCHOOLS- REOPENING SCHOOLS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS A PRIORITY TO MITIGATE A LOT OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT HAVE HEARD. DURING THE PEP PANDEMIC ON STUDENTS BUT PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE. STUDENTS THAT ARE HOMELESS AND YOUNG STUDENTS THEY HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AND THESE BONDS ALONG WITH THE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS WE- WILL BE RECEIVING. TO THE LAST FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE WILL ASSIST SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS- DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT ON USES THAT WILL SUPPORT. FEEDING KIDS AND TEACHERS BACK SAFELY AS THE CLASSROOM AND THAT COULD BE ANYTHING- AROUND TESTING PP CLEANING VIOLATION AFTER CLASSROOMS. AND THE FEDERAL. THE SECOND- PROPOSAL IS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS THIS IS A TO GET RELIEF INTO- PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY IT'S A ONE TIME SIX DOLLAR TAX REFUND HELLO INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- SPECIFICALLY TO TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA YET KISI RECIPIENTS AND TWENTY TWENTY- K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; I. T. V. I.&lt;/c&gt;</u> TEMPLARS. THIRTY RECOGNITION THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO BEEN A SEVERELY IMPACTED AND THAT THEY ARE REALLY ENGINES OF. I MAKE GROWTH IN OUR STATE ARE WE REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT AND PROVIDE BELIEVE FOR THEM SO WE HAVE GRANTS OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- THROUGH- A FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TOTAL ASKED. WE ALSO ARE ASKING FOR- THE RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED AND THOSE INCLUDE- UNDER THOSE INCLUDE A LICENSE THAT LICENSE FEES UNDER THE BOARD OF BARBERING COSMETOLOGY AS WELL AS- BARS AND RESTAURANTS. AND THEN LASTLY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED THE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION- AND DISCUSS THE WAYS OF GETTING OUT THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION WERE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT SO THOSE THE FIVE IMMEDIATE BUDGET. AN OBVIOUS THERE MAY OTHER- THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE'S ANOTHER PACKAGE OF EARLY ACTION ITEMS THAT WILL BE ASKING FOR AS WELL AND I'LL QUICKLY GO OVER SOME OF THOSE IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES THEY WANTED TO REALLY PREVIOUS IMMEDIATE BUDGET ACTION FOR YOU. IN ADDITION TO THAT WOULD ACTION THE BUDGET INCLUDES A SUITE OF PROPOSALS. PROBLEM OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH A JOBS INITIATIVE. ADD TO THE OVERALL ASKING FOR SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION- OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION WILL BE REQUESTED FOR EARLY ACTION- AND THIS IS REALLY SUPPORT. BY WAY OF GRANTS CREDIT MICROGRAMS LOAN GUARANTEES. AND SALES AND USE TAX WAIVERS- THIS. IS ALIGNED WITH SOME OF THE OTHER- EARLIER. IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE IN THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES MANY PROJECTS- MANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE JOB CREATING. PROJECTS SUCH AS THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS THIS IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS. LOCAL GRANT GRANTS TO LOCALS THAT WILL BASICALLY- ALLOW THEM TO JUMP START PROJECTS THAT OUR FUTURE LONG TERM HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. ON THIS TO BE LIKE LIGHTING AND SEWERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT IS NECESSARY FOR HOUSING. BOB WHAT WE ALSO HAVE. OUR THAT AN OURS YOU'RE A MISSION HERE. AND WILDFIRE FORCES PACKAGES- THAT WILL LIKELY START. GROWTH AS WELL AS ADVANCE TO STATE SCHOOLS TOWARDS CLEAN AIR. AND DEAL WITH THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS- THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PACKAGES AT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- OF WHICH WILL BE ASKING- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION FOR EARLY ACTION. I PUT THAT IN RED TO DENOTE THE DIFFERENCE- THE ONE BILLION WOULD BE EAST OF THE CHARACTERIZATION OF FUTURE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES TO ALLOW FOR CONSTRUCTION OF CHARGING STATIONS- HENCE THAT THE JOB GROWTH RATE THERE- AND THEN FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION WILL BE FOR INCENTIVES. TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE US. WHAT ARE THE WILD FIRES FOR A RESILIENT PACKAGES REALLY IMPORTANT AT- AND MINDS. IT THEN HE OF THE WORST FIRE SEASON EVER WITH OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES- BURNED IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TO ADDRESS THE SCALE AND URGENCY OF WILDFIRE RISK THE BUDGET INCLUDES A BILLION. ONE BILLION TO SUPPORT THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE'S. WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN- AND THAT'S REALLY IT WILL JUMP START PROJECTS AROUND FOREST MANAGEMENT SECURING FUEL BREAKS. AND HARDENING. AND HAS UNDER. THE OF WERE DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY AS SOME OF THE FACTORS ARE BEING RESHAPED ENTIRELY BY THE RECESSION- AN EXAMPLE IS THE LEISURE SECTOR- SO THE- BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- TO IMPROVE LINKAGES BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTES AND EMPLOYERS. AND WE'RE WORKING ON PROPOSALS IN REGARDS- HIGHER EDUCATION HAS SEVERAL APPRENTICESHIPS AND WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TOTALING SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION AND HEN ARE HIGHER IS TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS- INCLUDE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR WHICH WERE ASKING EARLY ACTION. AND THEY COVER THE FOLLOWING- AREAS CONSTRUCTION FORESTRY AND ASK HEALTHCARE TRAINING LOGISTICS AND IT AND BASED ON- ARE A REVIEW OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THIS DOLLAR AMOUNT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED JOBS. SO MOVING ON TO EDUCATION- INCREASES IN REVENUES HAVE LED TO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND- WE'RE SEEING THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER OF THE FUNDS GO TOWARDS PROP NINETY EIGHT EIGHTY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH SIXTY BILLION OF THAT IS GENERAL FUND- WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO INCLUDE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WHICH FULLY FUNDS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AT TARGET LEVELS. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION- WE ARE- PROPOSING TO PAY OFF A MAJORITY OF THE . TWELVE DEFERRALS THAT WERE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET THAT WAS TWELVE POINT NINE BILLION. IN TOTAL AND WE'RE PROPOSING A PATH OF NINE POINT TWO BILLION. AND ADDITIONALLY ARE PROPOSING. THREE POINT FOUR MILLION ON TOP OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT- SO THIS IS MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS. AND THAT INCLUDES A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT OF TWO POINT THREE BILLION AND- RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION RATE BUY DOWN A ONE POINT ONE BILLION. SOMEONE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON THIS NEXT SLIDE- THE EXTENDED LEARNING TIME FLIES. AND THIS IS- OUR LARGEST EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE ACTION AND IT BUT IT DOES COMPLIMENTS THAT IMMEDIATE ACTION TO BILLION PROPOSAL OF REOPENING SCHOOLS- AGAIN JUST SORT OF JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THE HUGE DISRUPTIONS. THAT STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WE AE PROPOSING FOUR POINT SIX BILLION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS AND THE IDEA IS TO ASK FOR EARLY ACTION ON THIS TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE DISTRICTS- AND TEACHERS TO WORK ON PLANS TO HELP- MITIGATE WHAT'S- WHAT'S OCCURRED SO FAR AND TARGETED INTERVENTIONS COULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY LEARNING HUBS- THIS SUMMER SCHOOL BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AS EXAMPLES. IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT INCREASES- FOR ALL THE SEGMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC I'M STARTING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE BASIC CREASES OF A HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION FOR THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ON PROPOSAL FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- AT THIS POINT LEAVE UP THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THERE IS ABOUT AN FEES WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL DURING RECESSIONS USUALLY- PEOPLE END UP GOING BACK TO SCHOOL BUT DID 8% DECREASE IN- INVOLVEMENT. IS CONCERNING BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES OF PEOPLE TO COMPLETION AND COMPLETING- THERE HIGHER END PLANS- SO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS INCLUDED A HUNDRED MILLION FOR EARLY ACTION AND SORRY I DIDN'T SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE. A RED HUNDRED MILLION NEXT YEAR REGENCY FINANCIAL AID- AND THEN THE CSU AND UC SYSTEM OF EACH- WE'RE PROPOSING A 3% BASE INCREASE FOR EACH OF THOSE AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE ALSO- OTHER ONGOING AND ONE TIME DOLLARS. BEING INVESTED. AND LASTLY- THE PLAN AID- THIRTY FIVE A THREE FIVE MILLION FOUR NINE THOUSAND NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT. I HOMELESSNESS- BUT WE HAVE A LARGE PROPOSAL ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION IN GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ACQUIRE HOUSING- THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- IS FOR ABOUT- DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR HUNKY- UP PROGRAM WHICH THEY STOOD UP IN THE FALL VERY QUICKLY AND I USED ZERO DOLLARS FOR THAT A CROWD OF BUYERS REALLY FUND DOLLARS- THEY'RE ASKING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN EARLY ACTION THERE SO THAT- WE CAN. ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED- HOMELESSNESS ISSUES IN ADDITION- SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WILL GO FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO EXPAND COMMUNITY- CONTINUING CONTINUING CARE TREATMENT AND THIS IS REALLY TO EXPAND THE TYPES OF- UNITS THAT WERE BEING REQUIRED SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. INDIVIDUALS WITH MORE Q. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND LASTLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- FOR MOBILE SENIORS IN THIS IS THIS WOULD BE ADDING TO THE SUPPLY OF. HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS. AND ON THE HEALTH FRONT- COVENANT PANDA HAVE ALL UNDERSTOOD THE TAKES. COVERAGE AN INCREASE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE FOR AFTER ALL THE STATE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE PAST AND THIS BUDGET CONTINUES THAT WITH THE PROPOSAL TO OPENED- THE NEW OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COST AND QUALITY AND DEVELOP COST TARGETS FOR THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS IN FORCE COMPLIANCE- IT IN THAT INDUSTRY. THE PANDEMIC IS OBVIOUSLY TAKEN A TOLL ON EVERYBODY'S MENTAL HEALTH- BUT PARTICULARLY STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SO WE HAVE A PROPOSAL OF THE FORTY FIFTY MILLION FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICES AND SCHOOLS TO BETTER TO BETTER- IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTIONS FOR. YOUNG STUDENTS. AND LASTLY I'M SORRY CAL AIMED. AT REINTRODUCING CAL AIM TO SUPPORT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND REALLY TRANSFORM THE DELIVERY YSTEM- IN REGARDS TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TO IT SO WE'RE BETTER CONNECTING THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED WITH- THESE INDIVIDUALS- AND LASTLY HERE IS THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL- WHICH IS A PILOTS- AND THE- WHAT. HURT ME THERE IS A- LONG LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN REFERRED BY TRIAL COURTS TO- GO TO A STATE HOSPITAL- AND OTHER AWAITING PLACEMENT THERE THEY'RE IN JAIL SO THIS PROPOSAL- BASICALLY LIKE THAT HOW POLITICAL HOW COUNTIES CAN PROVIDE. STREAMLINED CARE FOR THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR OUTCOMES. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE FLIGHT ON CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THE BUDGET PRIORITIZES STUMBLE CLIMENT PROPOSALS OF THE VIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OUR FIRST IS THE CAP AND TRADE PLAN AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND WE'RE ASKING FOR SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR OF THE AND EARLY ACTION. THAT REALLY HELPED ADVANCE THE STATE'S PARTIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CLEAN AIR AND WATER- WE HAVE A TOXIC THANK CLEAN UP- PROPOSAL. OUR TEAM VALERI CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES IN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THREE HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT WILL GO TOWARDS- ABOUT AN ASSESSMENT OF GENERAL- OR CONCISE AND LOOKING AT A HEALTH BASED CRITERIA DECIDING WHICH ONES WILL GET CLEANED UP FIRST. AND THIRTY ONE MILLION OF THE. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE IS FOR THE EXIDE CLEANUP. I'M LASSES INTEGRATE PEST- PROJECT THAT I REALLY IS LOOKING. REDUCE THE- USE OF TOXIC PESTICIDE- IN- IN OUR AGRICULTURE- PROGRAM. SO WITH THAT THAT IS- A LOOK AT. THE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- I AM HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS OF THE PRIMARY TIME ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU S. ERICA- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTORATE I DO F. MEMBERS BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS OR DO YOU F. I THINK I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE ELADIO THERE PRESENTATION IS A BIT BRIEFER. BUT THAT WAY WE CAN OPEN UP OR QUESTIONS TO BOTH ELIO AND DLF. SO IF THAT- WORKS- THE N. AS I MENTIONED IN THE OPENING IN ADDITION TO AN OVERVIEW ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. R. ELIA WILL GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL SUPPORT THAT WAS JUST APPROVED IN DECEMBER. MR PADDOCK WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU LOOK FOR TIER OVERVIEW. OKAY- EXCELLENT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MISTER VICE CHAIR AND SENATORS FOR INCLUDING OUR OFFICE IN TODAY'S HEARING MY NAME IS GAMEPAD IT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED I WILL PROVIDE SOME OVERVIEW REMARKS OPERATES OUR OFFICES INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND ALSO I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE OFFICE- SEVERAL OF THEM WERE JOINED IN AS WELL AND SO THEY CAN- ALSO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS OF SCIENCE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TODAY MY REMARKS WILL BE OUTLINED BY THE HAND OUT WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR MATERIALS. AND HOPEFULLY I'M SHARING MY SCREEN AND YOU CAN SEE IT THERE AS WELL. FOR ANYONE. THAT FOR ANYONE ELSE YOU CAN FIND THE HAND OUT AT OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOES. AND I'LL JUST MENTION. THAT WE ALSO HAVE OUR OUR REPORT ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT WAY- PUBLISHED ON- SUNDAY EVENING AND SO THAT CAN ALSO BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED. OKAY SO WITH THAT I WILL JUMP INTO THE FIRST PAGE. OF THE HANDOUT. AND HERE YES WE CALCULATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS ABOUT A FIFTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME SURPLUS. WHILE THIS IS QUITE LARGE IT IS NOTICEABLY DOWN FROM THE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR. WINDFALL THAT ARE NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK IDENTIFIED WERE ESTIMATED. WE REFERRED TO IT AS A WINDFALL I KNOW THIS IS BANNED THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO CALL IT WE DID REFER TO IT AS A WINDFALL. WE THOUGHT THAT HELPS EMPHASIZE THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THE SURPLUS AND ALSO IT'S SORT OF CONVEYS THE SENSE THAT IT'S MORE A FUNCTION OF REVENUES. NOT CLIMB JEAN IN THE WAY THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THIS YEAR AND- MORE THAN IT DOES ANY KIND OF- YOU KNOW SEARCH ABOUT THE HISTORIC TRENDS SO. THAT'S THE- GOOD THE REASON WE CALL IT A WINDFALL AND- IT ONE OTHER THING IS NOTABLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFICES OUR OFFICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF THIS ONE FALL IS THAT WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR REVENUE ESTIMATES. IN FACT OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS HIGHER THAN OUR OFFICE BY ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. REVENUES IN BUDGET. SO THAT LEAVES THE QUESTION AS WELL WHAT IS CAUSING THE DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE MAIN REASONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THE FIRST IS THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION- HAS HIGHER CAPITAL GAINS RELATED TAX REVENUES AND ALSO HAS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES FOR WHEN A DEPOSIT OR A TRUE UP DEPOSIT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION CHIU FOR THE STATE'S RAINY DAY FUND AND DEBT REPAYMENT REQUIREMENTS AND SO AS A RESULT. OF THOSE pGAINS AND THE- DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF WHEN A TRUE UP- DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED. BERMAN A FINANCE HAS A FIVE POINT SIX BILLION- YEAH AND- USE THEIR WHICH DETRACTS FROM THE SURPLUS THROUGH THE WINDFALL. THE SECOND DIFFERENCE IS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND HIGHER COLLUDED RELATED EXPENDITURES THAN WE HAVE IN OUR- HAD IN OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK. AND THEN THIRD THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AROUND TWO BILLION YEN HIGHER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY THE CASELOAD DRIVEN PROGRAMS. OKAY SO. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE THE TWO FIGURES ON THIS SLIDE- IT OFFER A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNOR IS ALLOCATING THE WINDFALL- THE TOP FIGURE THE USE OR THE DONUT SHAPED FIGURE- PROVIDES A BREAK OUT IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THE GOVERNOR HAS EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION. WHAT TOWARD ONE TIMER TEMPORARY PURPOSES THAT'S ABOUT POINT NINE BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY RESERVES PRIMARILY TO STATES THAT SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IS USED FOR REVENUE REDUCTIONS WHICH IS LARGELY THE TAX REFUNDS FOR LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS- THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATES ONE POINT THREE BILLION TO NEW ONGOING SPENDING. AND THEN HE HAS AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION OF ADDITIONAL DEBT AND LIABILITY HEY MAN BEYOND WHAT THE EXISTING LAW WOULD REQUIRE. THE SECOND FIGURE BELOW. NOT TO YOU KNOW REALLY REPEAT WHAT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FINANCE SAID BUT EACH THERE ARE SHOWING THE DIFFERENT- ALLOCATIONS OF THE WINDFALL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BY KIND OF PROGRAM AREA SO THE DARK BARS SHOWING THE ONE TIME IN THE LATER PARTS OF THE BAR SHOWING THE ONGOING PORTION. ONE THE NEXT FLIGHT AS WAS MENTIONED- DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. THROUGH THE IN THE BUDGET WINDOWS CELL FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THROUGH. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE STATE HAS NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION AVAILABLE FOR NEW SPENDING ON K. THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION. AND THIS SLIDE. SUMMARIZES BY THE MAJOR AREAS WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO ALLOCATE THESE RESOURCES. THE FIRST IS- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING FOR DEFERRAL PAID DOWN SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT TOTAL- DEFERRALS THAT WERE. UTILIZED IN THE JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PACKAGE- IT WOULD LEAVE AROUND FOUR BILLION OF DEBT DEFERRALS ON THE BOOKS AFTER THE CURRENT YEAR- BUT AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THE GOVERNOR ALSO IS REQUESTING SIX POINT SIX BILLION IN FUNDING FOR ONE TIME GRANTS FOR SCHOOLS TWO BILLION OF THIS IS THE FUNDING THAT WOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVIZE INCENTIVIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RESUME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND THEN FOUR POINT SIX BILLION OF IT IS FOR THE EXPANDED EXPANDED- ACADEMIC SUPPORT- OFFERINGS. THE TICKET WERE REALLY AIMED AT SOME OF THE STATE'S HIGHER NEED STUDENTS. AND THEN LAST THE THERE IS TWO POINT TWO BILLION TO US FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. OUR OUR OVERALL VIEW OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS THAT IT DOES REFLECT A VERY REASONABLE NEXT OF ONE TIME AND ONGOING PROPOSALS. IN PARTICULAR THE SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF- ONE TIME AS PER ONE TIME SPENDING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. IS PRUDENT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. IN THE SENSE THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN IT IT WOULD INSULATE- PROGRAMS FROM HAVING TO BE CUT SO SOON SO- WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL IS GENERALLY- FINDING ABOUT THE RIGHT MIX OF ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING. OKAY ARE MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE IS WHERE WE GET INTO A DISCUSSION OF THIS THE STATE'S PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF THIS GENERAL RELIEF PACKAGE AS THE TRIGGER MENTION MENTION. AND WE JUST KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS DEVELOPED- BEFORE YOU YOU KNOW INHERENTLY WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE- THAT'S THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE WAS ADOPTED. AND SO IN LIGHT OF THAT WE DO THINK THAT YOU MAY. WANT TO CONSIDER OR DETERMINE HOW BEST TO TARGET STATE RESOURCES. SO THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN LINE TO ALREADY RECEIVED A FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AND SECONDLY KIND OF RELATED TO THAT. WE WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW THE U. S. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS THAT THE STATE WOULD WANT TO BE CAREFUL TO COMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGES RATHER THAN A DUPLICATE THE FEDERAL EFFORTS. SO S. AS WAS MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR IS ASKING FOR YOUR APPROVAL IN THE LEGISLATURE SOME MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSALS TO BE TAKEN ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS OR AND EARLY ACTION BASIS. THE SOME OF THE USERS AROUND TWELVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH FIVE BILLION OF IT BEING IN THE IMMEDIATE ACTION CATEGORIES. AND CATEGORY AND WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF THESE- MENTION YOU KNOW THEY THE TWO BILLION FOR A RESUMPTION OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THE SCHOOLS. REYES IS A BIT OF CONCERN BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT THE DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY WITHIN THE TIME LINE AS PROPOSED AND YOU KNOW THE CONCERNED THEY'RE BEING WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DISSUADE SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM PARTICIPATING BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE. ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MILESTONES NECESSARY SO THAT'S A CONCERN WE HAVE ON THAT ONE. ON THE- TAX REFUNDS FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS WAS DEVELOPED. BEFORE WE HAD THE FINAL SHOULD RELIEF PACKAGE AND SO YOU KNOW THE UNDER THAT PACKAGE MOST TAXPAYERS IN THE COUNTRY WILL RECEIVE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR STIMULUS CHECKS AND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF THE- GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROGRAM AND SO. YOU KNOW YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WAYS TO TARGET THOSE FUNDS TO. YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING THAT KIND OF STUFF US FEDERAL SUPPORT. BUT THEN WHEN IT COMES. TO THE SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFIT THIS IS GROUP. AND THE FEE WAIVER- WE THINK THOSE ARE. REASONABLE YEAH- WORTH YOUR YOU KNOW WORTH YOUR CAN- WHEN IT COMES THE EARLIER FROM. WHICH SOME TO ROUNDS POINT DALY DOLLARS. YOU KNOW HERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS A BIT MORE TIME TO CONSIDER THEM IN SO WE COULD FORWARD FOR YOU IS- A FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT THEM REALLY IN THE FORM OF FOUR QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ARE- QUESTIONS LIKE- DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF IT. YOU KNOW PANDEMIC RELATED PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM REALLY EXPLICITLY TIED TO THE PANDEMIC. SECONDLY IS THE PROPOSAL YOU KNOW REALLY TIME SENSITIVE OR IS ALL OF THE FUNDING BEING REQUESTED TIME SENSITIVE IT IF SO. AND THEN FINALLY IS THERE SUFFICIENT DETAIL IN THE PROPOSAL. ENABLING THE LEGISLATURE TO- ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSAL- SO THAT'S KIND OF A UNUSUAL SIGHTS ON- HOW TO THINK ABOUT THOSE- EARLY ACTION REQUEST- THE OTHER THING WE JUST ALSO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT IN CONCLUSION AND POINT OUT IS THAT. AS WITH THE OUR OFFICE IS NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK WHERE WE IDENTIFY THE OPENING OF A NEW A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE COMING YEARS. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO IDENTIFIES TO THE EMERGENCE OF A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN FUTURE YEARS AND SO- YOU KNOW WE JUST PUT THE FACT THAT YOU WILL WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS YOU CONSIDER HOW TO ALLOCATE THIS WINDFALL IN THE VARIOUS CHOICES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU WE DO THINK YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP IN MIND- PLEASE OUT YOUR FISCAL PRESSURES AS YOU DELIBERATE- LET'S SEE THE OTHER BEING WHO ARE. SORRY HELLO STARTED. WE ALSO PROVIDED ON THE FINAL TWO PAGES OF YOUR HAND OUT WE HAVE- SUMMARIZED AND PUT IN TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL PACKAGE SO WE PROVIDE HERE- THE MAJOR TYPES OF ASSISTANCE INTO THE INTO THE CATEGORIES OF ASSISTANCE. THEN WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL COME AND FLOW THROUGH TO CALIFORNIA. AND THEN LASTLY WE PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THESE AND SO. THIS THIS INFORMATION ON THE FINAL TWO SLIDES IS REALLY FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND TO KIND OF. HELP PROVIDED. ORGANIZED WAY TO LOOK AT THE FEDERAL PACKAGE. SO WITH THAT I'M- HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS YOU YOU MAY HAVE. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MR PADDOCK FOR PRESENTING THAT AND- MEMBERS WE WILL OBVIOUSLY NOW TURN TO QUESTIONS TO BOTH- L. A. R. D. O. F. AND- BEFORE I CALL WHEN YOU I WOULD TAKE THE PREROGATIVE OF THE CHAIR. Q. A- ASK A FEW OVER ARCHING- SO AS WE'VE HEARD REVENUES ARE HIGHER AND- THE END AND THEY'VE BEEN HIGHER IF YOU WE IF WE LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AT LEAST OUR STATE REVENUES FROM THAT DO YOU ARE PROJECTED HAVE BEEN HIGHER EACH YEAR FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THEN- THEN THE BUDGETS WE ADOPTED SO. WHAT I'M MY QUESTION IS. GIVEN OUT OF OUR ACTUARIAL I WOULD SAY WELL THIS AND THAT- INDICATE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE SIMILAR FORECASTS HOWEVER BOTH BELIAU INDIA WEF. SAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING REVENUES AT A SLOWER RATE- CAN YOU BOTH GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHY YOU ARE PREDICTING FOR US THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SEWER RATE REVENUES. HI MADAM CHAIR CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION TO J. CHAMBERLAIN AND AT FINANCE SURE. I GOOD GOOD MORNING- SO YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT WE ARE PROJECTING SLOWING GROWTH OF REVENUES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE REAL REASON IS THAT- HELLO I TAKE THE MAYES THERE'S TWO REASONS I GUESS. THAT I WOULD THAT WOULD POINT TO FIRST OF ALL- CAPITAL GAINS IS EXPECTED HIT A PEAK IN THE CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR SO IN THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR WE EXPECT CAPITAL GAINS TO PEAK. AND EXPECT THEM TO BE DROPPING OFF AFTER AFTER THAT AND THIS IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE STOCK MARKET. IS GOING TO BE IS HIGHLY VALUED AT THIS POINT AND THAT IT COULD- THE STOCK MARKET SHOULD GROW ONLY SLOWLY OVER THE COMING YEARS WITH IT WHICH I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT. THE L. WAS ME ON THE OTHER THING IS THAT- AS AS ERICA HAS POINTED OUT. WE HAD- HELLO OF THE A LOT OF THE PAIN THAT FELT THIS. IN OF AMERICAN PAIN WAS AT THE WAS BY LOW WAGE. SO THAT- THE WAGE GROWTH ARE YOU ARE THE WAY TO CLIENTS THAT WE SAW WERE WAS REALLY. A FOCUS ON LOW WAGE EARNERS WHICH MEANT THAT- THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME BECAME OF MORE HAVE. BECAME MORE EXAGGERATED AND THAT THE- BETWEEN HIGH INCOME LOW INCOME DURING THIS PERIOD WE EXPECT SOME OF THAT- WIND AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. AS HAS A LOW WAGE EARNERS- WE HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR JOBS AND SO LONG THE WAGE GROWTH. OR LISA DID- SOMEWHAT HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF WAGE GROWTH IN COMING YEARS WILL BE LOW INCOME SO THOSE TWO FACTORS ARE GOING TO MEAN THAT- THAT WE WILL HAVE DROPPED A DROP IN CAPS GAINS AND WAGE GROWTH WE DO GET. IS GOING TO BE TAXED AT A LOWER RATE AND SO OVERALL- WE EXPECT REVENUES. TO GROW FAIRLY SLOWLY. I'M L. A. O. D. YOU WANT TO THAT- I'D BE TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SIMILAR TO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK IN OUR- MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK WE HAVE RELATIVELY GRADUAL APPRECIATION IN THE STOCK MARKET CERTAINLY THAT COULD BE. PROVEN TO BE WRONG IT COULD BE HIGHER- YOU COULD BE LOWER BUT WE SAT THE BEST THE BEST ESTIMATE IS TO KIND OF GO FROM WHERE WE ARE AND EXT EXPECT CUTS SOME GRADUAL APPRECIATION ONE THING WE DID IN OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK IS ASKED A QUESTION. HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOOD MISSTATED ORDER TO NOT HAVE THESE STRUCTURAL. DEFICITS EMERGE AND WHAT WE DETERMINED IN THAT EXERCISE WAS THAT WHILE YOU UNDOUBTEDLY WILL BE WRONG TO SOME DEGREE AS WE TRY TO FORECAST REVENUES BY THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH NATURAL REVENUE GROWTH TO ELIMINATE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT JUST KIND OF ON THE NATURAL. WORLD IS UNLIKELY KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THE BEYOND THIS YOU KNOW STANDARD DEVIATION THAT WE WOULD EXPECT. AND EXPECT AS AS POSSIBLE OR LIKELY- THAT BEING SAID ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS WAS TO. RETHINK THE SCAR STATUARY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT SO THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WOULD BE SMALLER NOW THAN WHAT WE WERE EXT YOU KNOW FORECASTING IN NOVEMBER. SO AS A RESULT OF THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT- MORE LIKELY THAT ARE REVENUES WHICH OUTPERFORMED OUR BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ENOUGH TO ELIMINATE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- BUT- YOU KNOW. BY AND LARGE I THINK- THE OTHER COMMENTS- BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE PROBABLY ARE- IN LINE WITH IT THE WORK THAT YOU THAT WE WOULD HAVE AND I COULD OFFER THEM I DON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN DEALER WHO OVERSEES OUR REVENUE FORECASTING- EFFORTS IT'S. IF HE WOULD WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GRANULAR WITH THE ALIEN JUST REAL QUICKLY JUST. TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON WHY WE MIGHT BE EXPECTING SOMEWHAT SLOWER ECONOMIC AND REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE FOR THE OUT YEARS. I THINK THE SIMPLE STORY IS THAT WE SEEN. A LARGE KIND OF DISLOCATION BOTH IN THE STATE'S LABOR MARKETS AND IN OUR- OKAY A SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE- WELL WE'VE SEEN THAT. RECOVER FASTER FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TENDER EARLY PANDEMIC RECESSION THAN WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED THERE STILL ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED THERE STILL ARE A LOT OF. BUSINESSES THAT ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSSES AND IT WILL TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR- THOSE ARE FACTS TO CORRECT AND FOR US TO GET BACK TO KIND OF PRE PANDEMIC ECONOMIC LEVELS. THANK YOU. I'M I NOTE THAT MR PADDICK IN YOUR SLIDES YOU REFERENCED A THAT IN THE NOVEMBER FORECAST YOU TALKED ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL. ACTED STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN REPEATED AND I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER NOW AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT DOCUMENT I CAN LOOK BACK BUT I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO HEAR CONCRETELY WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MIGHT BE HAVE. TO DO OUR BEST TO AVOID THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT DON'T ADDRESS THAT NOW I'M JUST PUTTING THAT OUT IS AND- KIND OF. NOTE I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS ONE IS THAT- THE PROPOSAL FROM THE FROM THE US FROM THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES A TRUE UP. TO OUR RESERVE STORE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. AND THAT'S THREE POINT TWO BILLION. NOW WE SUSPENDED LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE IN FISCAL EMERGENCY AND WE MIGHT BE IN A DEFICIT WE SUSPENDED. PUTTING THE DEPOSIT IN. ARE WE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A TRUE UP DEPOSIT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. MADAM CHAIR- I BELIEVE I READ IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THAT TRIP AND I AM GOING TO PASS THIS TO POLICE EMERGENCY FOR SOME MORE DETAILS. GOOD AFTERNOON. RESEARCHERS INCLUDES PART IN A FINANCE. I'M SORRY CAN YOU HEAR OTHER YEAH- YES SO WE ARE READING THE LAW IS THAT IT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AS IT STANDS ON SO WE BELIEVE IT'S A REASONABLE. EXPECTATION TO PUT THE OUT THIS TRANSFER INTO THE S. NINE AND IT'S FOUR POINT TWO BILLION IT WAS A BILLION FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY TRUE UP AND FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TRUMPETS THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT TWO BILLION. THROAT THIS NOTE WE HAVE NOT- WE HAVE NOT- LIFTED THE ACTION ON A FISCAL EMERGENCY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE LEGAL READ M. WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED ON. THAT FACT THAT THE REASON WE DID NOT HAVE TO PUT THE DEPOSIT IN LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE WE SUSPENDED BASED ON IF IT'S GOING TO EMERGENCY WE'VE WE HAVE NOT ACTED TO DISMANTLE THAT DECLARATION BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT AGAIN IS JUST. A POINT- I WAS GOING TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT- THE- B. CARES ACT MONEY AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF IT SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR SCHOOLS AND- JUST HOW THAT OVERLAPS WITH WHAT THE GOVERNORS ASKING FOR EARLY ACTION BUT I IMAGINE OTHER MEMBERS WILL WANT TO GET INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL SO I'LL LEAVE IT. AND LET THEM AND LET ME ASK MY LAST QUESTION WHICH IS THAT OUR- ACTION IN JUNE ON THE BUDGET FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR SUSPENDED SOME PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF OUR CONCERN THAT WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD HAVE INADEQUATE REVENUES AND THESE SUSPENSIONS. IF THEY HAD IF THEY WERE HAD ACTUALLY GONE INTO EFFECT OR CUTS TO VERY CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SUCH AS BY H. S. S. OR IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES ARE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY PROVIDER PAYMENTS ARE MEDICARE PROVIDER RATES- ON VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT. ALL OF WHICH OF COURSE DURING A PANDEMIC ARE UNDER GREATER NEED THAN EVER- BUT WHAT I NOTE IS THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS WELL WE ARE NOT ACTING OR RATHER THIS PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD NOT SUSPENDED PROGRAMS IT DOES PROJECT SUSPENDING THEM IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING HOWEVER THE BUDGET THAT YOU AFTERWARDS GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED ALSO INCLUDES ESTABLISHING CAL TEAM. WHICH I INTENDED TO RETHINK AND ENHANCE MEDIC CAL BUT IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT ON GOING COST SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GET FROM D. O. F. WHY DOES THE ONGOING BUDGET STRUCTURE SUPPORT CAL AIMED. HOWEVER WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CUTS TO THE CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT I REFERENCED. KAREN THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN IN LIGHT OF THE IMPROVE REVENUES WE DO DELAY- THE SCUTTLED SUSPENSIONS I THINK THEY ARE DELAYED RATHER THAN- TAKEN OFF- THE TOP TAKEN OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE OF THE OPERATING DEFICIT THAT WE FORESEE. IN THE FUTURE AND SO THAT THEY ARE A POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND- LIKE OTHER THINGS- THINGS WHICH THAT THE REVENUE PICTURE WILL CHANGE COME MAY AND AT THE MAY REVISION IT WILL TAKE A LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT IS AVAILABLE- BUT ASK YOUR SECOND POINT CAL AMES CAL AIM IS ONE OF FEW ONGOING EXPENDITURES THAT WE DO PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. AND WHAT WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED NOW SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ON GOING SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE TO HELP REDUCE BOTH INCREASE THE QUALITY AND REDUCE THE COST. OF TAKING CARE OF POPULATION SO THAT IS WHY YOU SEE- KELLY. IN AS A PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET. CERTIFIED OR STAND SO MY QUESTION ACTUALLY INTO PARTS IT WAS ONE AND THAT WAS THAT YES YOU DO DO YOU DO YOU CONTINUE THE PROGRAM SUSPENSIONS THERE JUST DELAYED FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER YOU RECOMMEND. A BRAND NEW PROGRAM. WITH EIGHT GF EXPENSE G. AT HIGHS G. OF COST. AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER IS THAT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT CAL AIMS WILL REDUCE COSTS OVER TIME DID I. CATCH THAT CORRECTLY ALL RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT- FIVE COURSE LIKE ALL MEMBERS HAVE MILLIONS MORE QUESTIONS BUT I WAS HOLD MYSELF AND- I DID NOT START A LIST SO LET ME SEE WHO- I SEE MR LAYERED MISTER DALI MISTER ROSS SO- MR AND CORTESE. OF ME SEE IF I HAVE ANY HANDS U ON MY- OF MY REMOTE PEOPLE. NOT YET- SORRY MR MCGUIRE- MISTER NIELSEN. MISTER WACO SKI. ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL- WE WILL START. WITH- FIVE YES AND SENATOR MEN AND SENATOR STERN. WE'LL START WITH SENATOR LAYERED GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE END OF I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR FINANCED IT YOU CAN. RESPOND TO OFFLINE AND THAT IS A NUMBER OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MONEY THAT IS IN THE BUDGET FOR WILDLAND FIRE AND WE WANT TO KNOW. FROM WHERE OUR LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WHETHER THEY CAN APPLY WORDS JUST GOING THROUGH OTHER GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND THEY'RE AT MERCED UC AND CAL POLY THERE'S RESEARCH ON WILDLAND FIRE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE SO OFFLINE IF YOU COULD JUST LET US KNOW WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR THAT MONEY OTHER THAN THAN CAL FIRE. BUT THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO ASK MORE ABOUT EDUCATION AND THE CHAIR JUST TEED UP MARCH FIRST QUESTION PERFECTLY AND THAT IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IN THIS IS TO FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET THERE'S TWO BILLION FOR SCHOOL RE OPENING AND THEN THERE'S FOUR POINT SIX BILLION FOR ACADEMIC SUPPORTS WHICH AMAZINGLY ADDS UP TO SIX POINT SIX BILLION. AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE CARES ACT A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED HIS BUDGET- ALLOCATED SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA A TO FINANCED YOU CONTEMPLATE. OF THIS OF PLANTING SOME OF THE MONEY THAT YOU RECOMMENDED. FOR SCHOOLS HOW DOES IT FIT TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SENATOR AND I STATED EARLIER- WE DID NOT- INVISION OR INCLUDED THE FEDERAL STIMULUS AS PART OF- THE BASELINE FOR THE BUDGET. BECAUSE OF TIMING AND THAT THE TWO BILLION A FOUR POINT SIX BILLION- SUPPORT CREATED OBVIOUSLY NINE. I'M TIRED OF KNOWING WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SEND. STATES LET ALONE SENT TO CALIFORNIA SO- IT IN WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY SCHOOLS THAT THE TWO MILLION ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IS ISN'T ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT AT THIS POINT. HOW WE SEE IT IS THAT THEY WOULD BE. COMPLEMENTARY SO ANY DOLLARS THAT THE STATE WOULD SPEND WOULD- ALSO BE. SUPPORTED BY FUTURE FEDERAL DOLLARS- AND THAT NUMBER JUST COINCIDENCE COINCIDENTALLY IS VERY SIMILAR BUT YOU'RE NOT CONTEMPLATING AMENDING YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THIS SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S COME IN SINCE YOU PROPOSED. AGAIN I WOULD SAY THE THIS WAY THE VISION WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE FED GOVERNMENT WOULD BE FUNDING AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT- RESOURCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING SO THAT WE CAN TAILOR THAT WITH OUR PROPOSAL- NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- YOU OF ASK THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. TO DO EARLY ACTIONS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US UNDER YOUR SCHEDULE TO ACT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO OR TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AND IT SEEMS TO US THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO HAVE. BEFORE WE WERE ASKED TO COMMIT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO I HOPE YOU WOULD JUST TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT- THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD- FOR FINANCE. IS THAT THERE WERE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRALS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET AND YOU PROPOSED PAYING OFF ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF IT. OF WHAT WAS YOUR NOW ASSISTS IN DECIDING HOW MUCH TO PAY OFF AND NOT TO ENTIRELY PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS. SURE AND I THINK THAT THE IDEA WAS TO PAY OFF AS MUCH AS WE COULD TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS CATER FOURTEEN. BUT ALSO TO ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FINES SO UNDER PRESSURE PRIORITIES COULD BE ADDRESSED AS WELL. AND ARE YOU AWARE. OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE DEFERRAL PROD- PROCESS THAT. THIS MIGHT NOT BE TAKEN CARE OF BY HOW MUCH YOUR- RECOMMENDING THAT WE PAY OFF IN THE DEFERRALS. I'LL I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES IN EDUCATION UNIT AND IN REGARDS TO SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HI YES- THIS IS JESSICA HOMES WITH THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR LAYERED. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING- WITH THAT WITH THE NEW TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DEFERRAL- THAT WOULD REALLY REPRESENTS A JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL- AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE- QUICK REPAYMENT OF THE FUNDS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE. OVERLY BURDENSOME FOR MOST ELEAZAR. I'M ON THE K. TWELVE FIVE. COULD NOT ADJUST UP IF THERE ARE WE CONSIDER THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS AT THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. AND THEN IN HIGHER EDUCATION BEFORE GET TO SCHOOL RE OPENING- THERE IS SOME CONTEMPLATION AND- UCCS YOU SIDE ARE WITH EXPECTATION TO ONLINE OFFERINGS AND THEN IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE THERE SO. ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR BLOCK GRANTS FOR ONLINE SUPPORT AND THEY'VE HAD IN ROMAN DROPS DID ARRANGE A DATE RANGE FROM 10% TO THE L. A. COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO EIGHTEEN AND 20% AND OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR ONLINE IS TO HELP THEM STRUGGLE WITH WHAT HAS CAUSED OUR ENVIRONMENT DROPS. I HAVE A QUESTION ON TO CHRIS FERGUSON AT- WHEN MY COLLEAGUES. SURE SENATE EARLIER CRACK CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE GAS DEPARTMENT FINANCED. CHAU THE PROPOSAL IS FOR THE UC CSU AND PCPS TO MAINTAIN THEIR ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS ABRUPTLY TEN PERCENT- TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN THEY WERE PRE PANDEMIC. WE DO KNOW THAT WHILE THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS THAT HAVE STRUGGLED- IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT OTHERS- HAVE BENEFITTED FROM BEING IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT CAN PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR. YOU GUYS STUDENTS WHO HAVE OTHER FAMILIAL OBLIGATIONS OR EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS- SO WE'RE ASKING THEM TO MAINTAIN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BUT WE ARE NOT ASKING- A NECESSARILY THAT THE COLLEGES. MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR COURSES ONLINE. AS WELL-AS WE DO KNOW THAT THIS ALSO PROVIDES FOR FURTHER ACCESS- FOR STUDENTS. A. N. N. ALSO THE BUDGET CONTEMPLATES NO INCREASE IN TUITION AT CSU IN. HAND YOU SEE AND ALSO- THERE SOME REFORMS FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THAT MIGHT BETTER GET FINANCIAL AID TO PEOPLE- ARE DO YOU HAVE SOME CERTAINTY WITH NO TUITION INCREASES AND YOU HAVE A POSITION ON THE REFORMS OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION ON. ON ASSISTANCE IN THIS TOUGH TIME WITH THE PANDEMIC. THE BUDGET OUTLINED EXPECTATION THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MAINTAIN THEIR- TUITION IN BE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR. AT CURRENT LEVELS I'M SO THAT WOULD NOT BE AN INCREASE IN TUITION FROM THIS YEAR TO NEXT YEAR- SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE BASE AUGMENTATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. IN REGARDS TO- FINANCIAL AID PERFORMED I THINK WE WERE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT. WHAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS BRINGING FORWARD I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW SEVERAL COMPONENTS TO THEIR A PROPOSAL THAT- WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR UNDERSTANDING- ANOTHER COMPONENT I WOULD ADD IS THERE ARE RECENT CHANGES IN THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL. THAT ALTER THE ELIGIBILITY AND THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION CALCULATIONS FOR FEDERAL PELL GRANTS ONE OF THE UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAD BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT'S A LINING CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY WITH FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY SO WITH THAT CHANGE IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO. WORK THROUGH THAT. AND SEE WHAT THOSE IMPACTS WOULD BE. OKAY THANK YOU MUCH AND THEN. ON TO THE OTHER MAJOR TOPICS- PROPOSAL TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND I WOULD JUST SAY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE SALUTED FOR FORCING THE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS FOR FOSTER KIDS OR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS RATHER THAN- FALLING BETWEEN THE CRACKS OF IT WE ALL STIPULATE THAT IN PERSON EDUCATION IS MUCH BETTER AND SO IT'S GOOD TO THE GOVERNOR'S DOING THIS BUT AS WE HEARD. FROM THE L. A. O. JUST A MOMENT AGO- THEY SAID IN THEIR PROPOSAL THAT THAT THEY HAD CONCERN ABOUT ON FEASIBLE TIMELINES ARE WITH REGARD TO THE RE OPENING PROPOSAL AND JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WE'VE HAD SOME BIG DISTRICTS INCLUDING THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED THAT SAID THEY WILL NOT APPLY TO RE OPEN UNDER THE EXISTING DEADLINES I KNOW IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ IS THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT ANNOUNCED THAT NONE OF THE DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY FEEL THAT THIS WORKS FOR THEM AND THEY WILL NOT BE APPLYING. SO I WAS GONNA ASK FINANCE GIVEN THE L. A- SAYING THAT THEY THINK THAT DEADLINES ARE UNREASONABLE AND THE START OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO APPLY ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING ADJUSTING THE DEADLINES TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THE QUESTION THAT WE'VE RECEIVED QUITE A QUITE A BIT LATELY- I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS OBVIOUSLY TO GET. KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL TEACHERS BACK IN THE SCHOOL PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND ULTIMATELY- HAVE. HAVE SIGNIFICANT TIME IN THE CLASSROOM- BUT IN REGARDS TO- THE ACTUAL TIMING OF THAT THAT'S ALL I WILL PASS THAT QUESTION TO JESSICA HOLMES. THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM MANY MANY ALLIGATORS YOU CAN IMAGINE ON THE PROPOSAL. AND I THINK THAT THE FEASIBILITY QUESTION AND IT'S REALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE DISTRICT. HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO BECAUSE IT THAT FIRST TIME I THINK WHO ARE PLANNING ON NOT APPLYING IT AND NOT AS MUCH OF THE TIME LINE ISSUE AS THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND WE'RE CERTAINLY- TALKED WITH THEM TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE. BUT BUT IN TERMS OF PINING WE DO HAVE TWO OPTIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE OF AN APPLICATION BY FEBRUARY FIRST THE OTHER THING APPLICATION BY MARCH FIRST IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IT WILL TAKE. A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GET THE THINGS IN PLACE THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO REOPEN. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT MONEY ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW. NOT ONLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR BUT IN THE FALL. THAT NEITHER EARLY AGE REALLY NEED TO START MAKING THOSE PLANS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO NOW- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW DEPEND ON MAKING GOING TO IT'S GOING WE'RE GONNA BE TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE VALUES ARE PREPARED WELL SO WE ARE ALL. I'M HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOLKS WHO REACHED OUT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THEM. BACKING A REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO RE OPEN NOW IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING FOR THAT TO ENSURE THAT KIDS CAN ACT WITH THAT. YOU KNOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE FALL. BUT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL JUST. A CONTEMPLATES RE OPENING IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS AND- ISN'T NECESSARILY REWARDING PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE MAKING SURE THEY RE OPEN IN THE FALL AND I THINK. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S COME UP. IS THAT. TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WANT TO BE VACCINATED BEFORE THEY GO IN THE CLASSROOM. AND RIGHT NOW THE SCHEDULE DOESN'T SYNC UP TOTALLY WITH THE ABILITY TO BE VACCINATED. SO IF THESE TIMELINE SLIP TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS DO IT IT ALSO ALLOWS. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR IRAQ. AND THAT IS VERY AND- JUST SO THE I DON'T. THIS ONE LINE QUESTION. AND THEN THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE TIME LINES THAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE ANECDOTALLY. IT APPEARS THAT SCHOOLS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO APPLY RIGHT AWAY. OR MORE WELL TO DO FOR AFFLUENT AND A LOT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT REPRESENT DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS OR OR REPORT DISTRICTS. OR THE ONE THAT THEIR FARTHER BACK IN LINE AND WOULD GET LESS MONEY UNDER THE CURRENT THINGS EVEN IF THE DEADLINES HOLD. THE GOVERNOR SAID AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE. NOBODY IS DISADVANTAGED BASED ON THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THIS PROCESS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT'S TRUE WITH WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. SO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I AND I THINK- WHAT THE GOVERNOR WAS REFERRING TO AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE. BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE AROUND. IS REALLY AROUND AND COUNTY FOR THEIR HIGHER RATE THE TRANSMISSION SO CURRENTLY- COOL CAN OPEN. FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IF THEY'RE ABOVE A CERTAIN AGE- TRANSMISSION LEVEL IN THEIR IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AND THAT WOULD BRING THAT WOULD REMAIN UNDER A PROPOSAL FOR COUNTIES AND WILL TELL YOU CN COUNTY THAT ARE ABOUT TWENTY PER HUNDRED THOUSAND HOWEVER- WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS THAT THOSE. COULD APPLY FOR THE FUNDING- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ABLE TO REOPEN- IN IN THE SPRING AND USE THOSE FUNDS TO HELP THEM IN THE FALL- IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR ALLEVIATE THAT ARE SERVING OR ARE LOOKING TO COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO IN AREAS WHERE TRANSMISSION RATES ARE HIGHEST. SACRAMENTO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO. ON INJURY IN THE FUNDING AS WELL TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE BACK OF THE TO RIO. YOU IF THAT MEANS THEY ARE REAL SEVERAL MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE. SO THERE IS THAT- BACKS ALLOW WITH THE LANGUAGE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER OF THE QUESTION AND IT JUST REFLECTS. SORT OF A MENU OF BIG CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND GOD. YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE MEETING NEXT WEEK TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL SO LET ME I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR NIELSEN I SHOULD HAVE TURNED HIM IN AND- LET ME LET HIM ASK SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL I'LL TELL YOU I'VE GOT ON THE LIST- MISTER ALSO MISTER DALI MISTER CORTESE MISTER MCGUIRE MR MAKOWSKI SENATOR MEN SENATOR STERN AND SENATOR RICHMOND HAD CENTERED EMAIL SINCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND FIRST THIS BILL QUESTION TO FINANCE. NOTHING MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE BUCKLE. AT THIS IS A MASSIVE HISTORIC CONSEQUENCE. AND FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE PROVIDING SOME MONEY TO. HURT CALIFORNIANS I THINK SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IS PROPOSED. YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL BUT ONE THING THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE CANS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN AGREED TO BY THE INABILITY OF EDT TO DO ITS JOB. NOTWITHSTANDING WHATEVER HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED SO FAR. I DIDN'T SAY DONE I SAID IT KEPT IT. TO FIX THAT DEPARTMENT WE ARE STILL GETTING THE ALMOST THE SAME VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS FROM OUR CITIZENS. AND UNEMPLOYMENT. IS SOMETHING THAT IS A DIRECT AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO THE POCKETS. BUT MAYBE CALIFORNIANS. AND DEPENDING ON FEDERAL HELP. IT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW PROMISE SO THE QUESTION TO FINANCE WHAT. KIND OF CHANGES BY BEING PROPOSED. WITHIN EIGHTY DAYS. HELLO THIS SPECIFICALLY GIVEN EXAMPLE WHAT'S PROVOKED A LOT OF MY ANGST HERE. EARLY ON THE- REMEDY WAS TO TRANSFER NOW FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND TO. EIGHTY DATE. BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP MUCH BECAUSE THEY FOUND THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD TO BE TRAINED. AND TO TRAIN THEM. THEY HAD TO TAKETHE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK TRAINED OFF THEIR DUTY. THE BILL TRYING. THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A FRUSTRATION TELL TO THE QUESTION THAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF CHANGES TOP TO BOTTOM IN THAT ORGANIZATION. ARE GOING TO BE PROPOSED. AND I SUGGEST THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD IN OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. MAKE THE MORE SPECIFIC IN ALL AREAS. OF SPENDING PLEASE. FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR NIELSEN AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PAIN POINT FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE AND A SERIOUS ONE AT THAT- TO ADDRESS A COUPLE. THANKS OF YOUR QUESTION. WELL IT WAS OVERWHELMING AND I THINK THAT EDT AND UNEXPECTED- THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO BEEF UP THE U. I. PROGRAM INCLUDING THE REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES AS YOU MENTIONED INCLUDING HIRING- AND BORROWING OF SMOKE FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS- THE EXPANSION OF THE CALL CENTER HOURS EXPANSION OF CALL CENTER DAYS AND I'M STILL THERE THERE'S A WAITLIST SO UNDERSTANDABLY THIS IS A- IT WAS A DIFFICULT SITUATION. AND NO EXCUSES BUT THE WORKLOAD WAS CRASHING- SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN- THERE'S A FRAUD- HONESTLY IN IN THE PEE WEE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED- AND THERE HAS BEEN MEDIATED MANY MITIGATING- EFFORTS PUT INTO PLACE TO CHECK AND VERIFY IDEA FRONT AND VERSUS HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT ON THE BACK AND ON THE BACK AND WE ALSO HAVE HELLO YES AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ATTEMPTING TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE- BASICALLY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO DO. THE SYSTEM- AND IN REGARDS TO POTENTIAL R. OR SORRY PERSPECTIVE RESOURCES- THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE A JUDGE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RESOURCES- BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT AS THE NEW DIRECTOR- IS FACED WITH AND I THINK AS SHE ENTERS- THAT THAT POSITION MORE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION IN REGARDS TO. THE RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NECESSARY- OBVIOUSLY THEIR I. T. SYSTEM IT WAS- HAVE HAMPERED PROGRESS AS WELL AND SO- THE GODS STREET TEAM THAT LOOKED AT THEIR FUNCTIONS OF PROGRESS- AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NINETY SYSTEM- PUT A PRICE ON THAT FOR NOW SO THAT THEY COULD DEAL WITH THE CURRENT PROBLEMS BUT MORE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE DONE BOTH ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR I. T. SYSTEM AS WELL AS ON THE PROGRAM SITE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF. THE OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF BUT WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE HAVING KIND. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO UP- LEGISLATURE. DETERMINED BILLS- ARE BEING. AND SOME OF THE THAT ARE PROPOSED. THE MEDIA IS ALREADY ATTEMPTING TO DO SO AS TO RUN- ALLEGED. LIST AGAIN. THE CROSS CROSS- DOES DOUBLE CHECK A INELIGIBLE SUCH. IN MAY POPULATE- SO THINGS ARE BEING-DONE IN REAL TIME BUT OBVIOUSLY MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WELL WHAT I'M ASKING OF DVD THEN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO PROVIDE OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES. THERE OR THEY HAVE. R. PONDRE I THINK IT'LL BE PRO WANT TO BUT SAID SOME VERY SPECIFIC PLANS NOT GENERALIZATIONS BUT VERY SPECIFIC PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE GREATEST OUTRAGES OF THE CITIZENS HAS BEEN FINDING OUT THE INMATES IN PRISONS WERE BEING SOUGHT OUT. AND PROVIDED. CHECKS ONE DAY THAT CITIZENS COULD NOT EVEN CONTACT ANYBODY AB DE. THAT WILL TRANSITION EIGHT TO THAN OTHER POINT WHICH HELP BRING IN THAT'S MORE BROAD THE NEEDY BUT A FLEXIBLE TO IT MOST ASSUREDLY AND THAT IS. I. T. THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND THE ONLY BIG THING IT'S DONE OVER THE YEARS IN MY OPINION IS CHANGES NAY. BUT TO REALLY. GET CALIFORNIA WHAT WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS OF APPLYING NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF AMERICA. HARDLY ANY OF OUR MAJOR PROJECTS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHERE FISCALES HEADED NOW. COME IN ON BUDGET. BORON TIME. SO WHAT WILL THE GOVERNOR'S. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE PROVIDING US WITH SUGGESTIONS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE EXCESSIVE EXTRAVAGANCE. BUT VIçT IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING APPLICATIONS IN ATV. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- AT A HIGH LEVEL- THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- THAT HAD THEIR RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET TO CONTINUE TO BEEF UP THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN REGARDS TO ITS OVERSIGHT- OF- I. T. PROJECTS AND- YOU'RE RIGHT IT OFTENTIMES- THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD TO COMMENT ON THE BACK END. AND- HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CLEAN UP CERTAIN I. T- EFFORTS. AND THIS PROPOSAL REALLY LOOKING TO PROVIDE FOR PREVENTATIVE. ADVISORY UP FRONT SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN PROVIDE ITS EXPERTISE TO DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR IT AND BUSINESS- INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD TO PLAN TO BUILD OUT- BETTER TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO REALLY- GET TO WHAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT IS THE PROGRAMS- AND IF IN CASES WHERE THERE ARE BENEFICIARIES THAT BENEFITS ARE. ARE TIMELY AND ACCURATELY LIKE IN IN EDIE'S CASE- PROVIDE SO I WOULD TURN OVER THIS QUESTION TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET FOR. THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY PLEASE. GOOD MORNING THIS IS EVELYN SEES FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE BUDGET PROPOSES ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION IN- GENERAL FUND- BUT TOWARDS. CDPS EFFORT TO TARGET CRITICAL SERVICES- DAY WOULD PERFORM ASSESSMENTS OF VITAL AND AT RISK SERVICES- DEVELOP REPORT CARDS JUST- DR INTERVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS AND IDENTIFY KEY SAFE SAFEGUARDS- BELIEVES THAT. THESE RESEARCH ARE ASKED AND WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE- CURRENT- EFFORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO HELP. WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS. WELL I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD THE CONTACT MY OFFICE AND LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. MY FUNDAMENTAL POINT AND IT FLIES TO ALL AGENCIES IT IS THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE PASSING THIS BUDGET. AND NOT BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE AND EXPLICITLY SO IF YOU WILL MANDATING OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THIS THAT OR THE OTHER THING IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR FIRE. PREVENTION AND LET THE AGENCIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND. WE FOUND THAT THAT DID NOT WORK WHEN WE HAD THE FIRE TAX YEARS AGO. THE MONEY DIDN'T GO WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE. IT WAS A FAILURE. IT WAS NOT RENEWED BECAUSE IT WAS A FAVORITE WE DO A LOT OF IN THAT PATH AGAIN SO- LET'S JUST TRY TO GET BACK AND TALK SOME VERY SPECIFICS ABOUT THIS SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO MORE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH OF. ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS TIME I MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LATER THE- LET'S TALK ABOUT EDUCATION JUST A MINUTE NOW. IT WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TALKING ABOUT DISTANT EDUCATION. AND FOR SOME OF OUR CILDREN THAT'S GOOD FOR SOME OF OUR CHILDREN THAT'S BAD. WHAT I'VE HEARD. IS THAT FOR MOST CHILDREN IT'S BAD. AND AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE GETTING BACK INTO OUR SCHOOL FACILITIES AS SOON AS WE CAN AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN CVS DOMINATING IN THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN IS MOST IMPORTANT. BUT I DON'T THINK DISTANCE LEARNING IS THE WAY WE NEED TO GO IN THE FUTURE. AND WE ARE A CONSTRAINT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS DISTANT LEARNING I WOULD IMAGINE IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES. FOR NECESSARY EQUIPMENT. CAN ANYONE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TELL ME HOW THAT IS BEING PLANNED TO BE ACCOMMODATED AND PROVIDED. MEETING RESOURCES. FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT THEN ANOTHER SPECIFIC QUESTION AND NOW THIS WEEK TO THE SPECIFIC OTHER QUESTION IS IT YOUR PLAN THAT SCHOOLS TRANSITION NOW FROM IN CLASSROOM LEARNING. THE DISTANCE LEARNING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. I'M SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR- NIELSEN- THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION THAT WE ARE PROPOSING- COULD GO TOWARDS SCHOOLS- THAT WANT TO PAY FOR EXAMPLE MOVED INTO ANOTHER CLASSROOM SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE CAPORALI QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED BUT THAT IT SUPPORTS MORE CREATIVE AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF- CLASSROOM STRUCTURES- THAN CURRENTLY EXIST SO THERE'S THAT- IN REGARDS TO CAPITAL OUTLAY AND I'LL TURN IT TO WHEN MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE WHAT IS INCLUDED IN IN REGARDS TO THE OVERALL CAPITAL OUTLAY. THANK YOU. AT IMAGE HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU THINK YOU SENATOR NEAL SO- THE- FIVE THREE BILLION THAT WE- AND ROCK. FUNDS IN THE TWENTY BUDGET ACT AS WELL AS THE ONE FROM ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WENT OUT AFTER. AND SCHOOLS AND TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT ALL AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL TWO YEARS- FOR DISTANCE LEARNING COMPUTERS- CONNECTIVITY ALL OF THAT. IN ADDITION AND TO BE SCHOOLS WILL BE RECEIVING ANOTHER- SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT PROCESS PRETTY QUICKLY HERE. AND IN THE SECOND ROUND AFTER- THAT CAN BE USED FOR DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSES WHILE. I'M IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AND WE ARE. AIMING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THE FALL AT THIS POINT YES WE ARE SPINNING. AND THAT WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO AN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION MODEL AND THE FALL HOWEVER WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS REALLY FLUID. NEUBERGER MONITORING TRANSMISSION RATES AS WELL AS- YEAH THE PROGRESS ON THINGS LIKE VACCINATION- AND THAT YOU. COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING AND ALL OF THAT I'M AS WE AS WE LOOK. AT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT ALL. THE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE THAT DISTANCE LEARNING HAS OTHER TOP. THOUGH EEDED. FOR A- ARE SCHOOL MEALS PRO. PRACTICES AND LUNCH. INCLUDED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT SO. THAT IS NOT A QUESTION THAT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION MANAGER ALL DIFFICULT TO ONE MORE FOR NOW AND THEN I'LL YIELD MAYBE I'LL HAVE SOME MORE LATER. ABOUT TO. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMMUNIZATION. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE. TERRIFYING AND ELEMENT OF HOPE DYNAMIC THROUGHOUT OUR LAND TODAY. THE RORY BENSON PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. AT ANOTHER STAGE BIGGER PROBLEMS EVEN. AS YOU SUBMIT THE BUDGET THIS YEAR FINANCE WILL YOU BE PRESENTING US A PLAN FOR THE DISTRIBUTION. AND THE STORAGE. OF THESE VERY NEEDED IMMUNIZATIONS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I WAS THE VACCINES ARE TOP. AND OTHER MORE- DETAILED QUESTIONS- I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO RYAN MILLER. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT- IN THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION CLEARLY IS- KIND OF MOVING- AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO CHANGE- THE GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE OFFERED TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE DON'T WASTE VACCINES AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE YOU'VE LIKELY SEEN NEWS THIS WEEK ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE SORT OF MEGA CENTERS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE A DODGER STADIUM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP WITH FOR COUNTIES AND- AND- WE'VE BEEN IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THEM- ENTER. OF- A OF A- YEAH I THINK- THIS IS KIND OF OCCURRING NOW AND SO- YOU KNOW I WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ENGAGE I THINK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WAS STAFF MEMBERS I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN. A BRIEFING CALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- TRYING TO BALANCE THAT- YOU KNOW CLEARLY WITH THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO. TRY TO GET THE VACCINES OUT AND YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR WOULD STAY OUT OF THE FREEZERS AND INTO PEOPLE'S ARMS- SO YOU KNOW BAPPI DISPENSARY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT- IN TERMS OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL- YEAH I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET. THAT NECESSARILY. WELL WILL BE KNOCKING ON YOUR DOORS AS WE PROCEED. I'M NOT WILLING TO VOTE FOR SUBSTANTIAL MONIES FOR THIS WITHOUT A PLAN. ACTUALLY FOR MOST. ALL OF THIS. WITHOUT A PLAN. SO FUND. WE'RE GONNA TO BE A LOT MORE SPACE. AS BUDGET PROGRESS. AND ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT THERE JUST ISN'T TRUST. NO TRUST IN THE AGENCIES AND PER. AMONGST THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO REPRESENT AND DEAL WITH THEM HERE THEIR FLIGHT OUT THERE. THEY ARE IN TROUBLE THEY ARE UNHAPPY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'LL PROBABLY COME BACK A LITTLE LATER FOR SOME MORE THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON WILL NOW TURN TO SENATOR DRAWS SO AND MEMBERS I THINK I'VE CAPTURED ALL THOSE WHO HAD THEIR HANDS UP IN YOUR ON THE LIST SO- WE WILL PROCEED GO AHEAD SENATOR DERISIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- JUST WANT TO SAY THAT OVERALL I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR- MAKING AS A GENERAL PRIORITY HOW TO RESPOND TO THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT- AND IT'S KNOWLEDGES THAT THE RECOVERY HAS BEEN UNEQUAL- THAT'S A- TRUE IN DISTRICTS LIKE MY OWN. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THINGS LIKE THE E. I. T. C. A AND A FEW OTHER THINGS ARE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT POINT-% LOW PAID WORKERS WORKING IN- CRITICAL ECONOMIC SECTORS LIKE AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENT AND HOSPITALITY AND SERVICES HARD HIT. FOR MANY OF THEM THERE'S NO SAFETY NET. THE MAJORITY ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THESE LOW PAID JOBS- PLAN IMPLIED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WORK FROM HOME- HARDEST HIT BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE THE CONNECTIVITY IN THE DEVICES- AND THEN MY PARTICULAR- THERE ARE SAID TO BE ONE OUT OF THREE EVENTUALLY KNOWS. WHO ARE POSITIVE. HOMELESSNESS GROWING ENORMOUSLY AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF RENTERS WHO RUN THE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. BUT THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR- THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST AND MANY OF US THE MOST AND THAT IS OUR SENIORS. MOST VULNERABLE WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PANDEMIC MOST VULNERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR LEVEL OF POVERTY. AND MOST VULNERABLE IF THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED- IN C. JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE GOVERNOR HAD IN THE PROPOSED INCLUDING MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS THAT LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS WHO HAVE BEEN. CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO OUR STATE FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND- BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE. AW AND SO MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IN PARTICULAR ON SENIORS- HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLAIN LEAVING THESE VULNERABLE. THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND ACROSS THE STATE WITH OUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. OF AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERN FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND BECAUSE WE HAD- HE HAD MADE THE COMMITMENT TO THIS EXPANSION TO INCLUDE THEM UP PRIOR I UNDERSTAND AND I SOMEWHAT EXPECTED I DON'T MEAN TO PUT WORDS IN ANYBODY'S MOUTH AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- I DO EXPECT THAT IT'LL BE THAT UP COMMITMENT TO. ON GOING EXPENSES IS NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT SAID REP CENTER BUT THERE ARE AS I UNDERSTOOD. ONE POINT THREE EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ERA- THE NEW EXPENDITURES ONGOING NOT ONE TIME. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM. A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OR- R. LA- TO. EXPLAIN THAT- ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR- YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT SOME OF WHERE WE COME FROM IS TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE FOR THE BUDGET AND I'M GOING- PROPOSALS ARE DIFFICULT- AT THIS TIME DESPITE HAVING A SURPLUS IT IS ONE TIME AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE ONE TIME- INVESTMENT- AND I. SAID THE GOVERNOR'S BY IS THE STARTING POINT FOR CONVERSATIONS- WE WANT TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE ON YOUR PRIORITIES AND DISCUSS- AND COME TO UNDERSTANDING. AND AGREEMENT AT THE END- THAT REFLECTS- OUR OVERALL- PRIORITIES SO- THAT IS MARGIN STATE I THINK BUT- IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU SAID IT THIS IS NOT IS A NEW. AND THERE WILL BE BACK IN AND I'M THEIR MANY. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO- SUPPORT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SUPPORT AT THIS POINT. WELL I THINK IT A MATTER OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND I UNDERSTAND SO I THINK THE QUESTION THE CONVERSATION WILL BE ABOUT- WHAT ARE THE- WHAT MAKES YOU DECIDE THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE PRIORITY OVER SOMETHING ELSE LIKE I SAID ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO. OUR SENIORS- WHO NEED THAT PREVENTATIVE PRIMARY CARE SO THAT THEY AREN'T THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HIT THE HARDEST- I THINK ANOTHER AREA THAT THE- PLAN MINISTRATIONS- PROPOSAL- IS- EMPHASIZING IS JOB CREATION. AND I JUST WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE OF THE CHALCONE PETE'S TAX CREDIT- EXPANSION- IT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT. UNDER IS OF RECENT KALKA BEATS TAX CREDIT RECIPIENTS ARE HIGHLY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES SUCH AS LUCID MOTORS HONDA NORTHRUP. GRUMMOND THAT DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THE MONEY. SO HOW DO WE TARGET OR PRIORITIZE A TAX CREDIT FOR COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH LAYOFFS AND THEREFORE. THEY WOULD BE BRINGING BACK WORKERS OR COMPANIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO GOOD PAYING JOBS BECAUSE LORD KNOWS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. MILLIONS OF LITTLE. PAID NO WAY PAID JOBS AND THAT DOESN'T OUR ANY GOOD WHAT'S- WE HAVE TO A- BIG YOU KNOW THE OUT HOW TO SUBS. THE EMPLOYER IN THOSE CASES- SO I ONE- TO THE IF YOU COULD ADD THAT. HOW DO WE SURE THAT THESE TAX CREDIT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND IT- FOUR TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO SOME GOOD. WITH THOSE TAX DOLLARS. YES AND AS YOU MENTIONED THE CAL COMPETE EXPANSION IS FOUR NINETY MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND ANOTHER NINETY MILLION BUDGET YEAR THERE'S ALSO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND A NEW GRANTS PROGRAM THROUGH CAL COMPETE. THAT SHOULD REALLY OPEN UP THE FIELD SO THAT MORE BUSINESSES THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE NOT HAVE APPLIED- CAN IT NOW BECAUSE THESE OF THE STATE THEY HAD LITTLE TAX PLAY- AMONG THINGS AND SO THE IDEA IS TO- REALLY X. THE CREDITS AND THE GRANTS THAT ARE- OUT THERE SO THAT. BUSINESS CANNOT TO SUCH A YOU MIGHT YOU- WHO MAKE ARE THE SMALLER- ALL ARE MOM AND POP BUSINESSES- BUT FOR MORE DETAIL I LIKE TO TURN. OVER TO. MY COLLEAGUE AT- CLINTON CUT MCALLEN. RIGHT ON OF FINANCE- I THINK. THERE TWO COMPONENTS THE CHARACTER EACH THEIR BEEN NO TAX CREDIT- THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO IS I THINK THAT JUST OUT. IN THE GRANT COMPOSED- KHALKHIN HE SAID BOTH THESE HAVE PROPOSED ARE STE OR- EXPAND. AND- RETAINING BUSINESS AND HOW AND ALSO TO. COUNCIL YEAH AND I CAN TALKING GENERAL IS INTEREST IN THE SABBING A CREATING MORTGAGE JOB- IN THE NEXT IS COME TO MAKING THAT WORK- MOVING FORWARD AS A- I THINK I WOULD ALSO OUT THERE A COUPLE- TAX CREDITS TO. THE MEANS SMALL BUSINESS TAX. THAT I THINK- OUR MORAL TO CERTAIN YOUR POINT HERE ABOUT THE THAT HAD THE FOLKS OFF OR EXPAND TO REACH FOLKS. WE ALSO HAVE A ONE POINT ONE TO IN SMALL BUSINESS THAT ARE OUT- IN CAN GIO WITH ALL THE RECENT FEDERAL RELIEF ABOUT- PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE TV. PRO IN THE TYPES OF THE SO I THINK THAT THEY'RE TALKING HE DEFINITELY OF ANY. SORT OF RECOVERY TOOL- WHERE AS SOME OF THE DEGREE. AND OTHER PRO THAT ARE AND- ARE TRYING PROVIDE AN RELIEF TO THOSE BUSINESSES- MOST IN- YEAH AND I AM SIX. BE IN A MY- MANY YEARS A EXPERIENCE ON THESE ISSUE- UNLESS WE HAVE SOME VERY STE. REQUIRE FOR THE GOOD JOB CREATION. IN THE CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE. OR IN A- FOR SUB. IT'S REALLY DIFFER TO- YOU JUST VERY BROAD SAY. WELL WE'RE GOING TO GOOD JOBS THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. ON IT IS MORE SPECIFIC- AND UNLESS WE SAY THIS IS WHAT'S EXPECTED QUALITY TRAINING HIRING EQUITY FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE- MAKING SURE WE KNOW THAT THEIR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. IN WHICH- LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WHERE IT IS- PREDOMINANTLY ESPECIALLY AS YOU GET HIGHER UP THE RANKS WHY AND MALE. ALL WELL HOW DO WE BREAK THROUGH HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPANIES THAT WE'RE GIVING OUR TAX DOLLARS TO. REALLY ARE RESPECTING EQUITY REALLY RESPECTING DIVERSITY WHEN IT COMES TO A JOB A CAREER THAT PAYS WELL. WE KNOW THAT THE LOWER THE ON THE TOTEM POLE THE DARKER THE SKIN THE LOWER THE PAY. THAT'S VERY COMMON IN A LOT OF A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR TAX DOLLAR ARE USED FOR REAL RECOVERY. WE TALK ABOUT THE POVERTY WE TALK ABOUT- HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES BUT HOW DO WE USE OUR TAX DOLLARS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD- AND I. INTEND TO- AT THE- PROPOSAL- ON A COW. JOBS WE I REALLY WOULD- J. ONE WORKER THE ADMIN- TWENTY CORP INTO THE FRAY. WHETHER IT'S A- US SPECIALLY GROUND- IN THE ALLOCATE PRODUCT UP. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- ARE YOU. ALL FOUR WERE. BOB GOOD JOB CREATION- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE ON THAT BUT THE. DEPARTMENT FOR. YES I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN SOME AND THEN CAL COMPUTER THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC- REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO JOB CREATION- BUT YOU'RE- IN THAT THE I IS TO REALLY- RELIEF TO BUSINESSES THAT NEED IT AND I WOULD JUST ECHO MY WHO MENTIONED THE SWEET WE HAVE A SUITE OF PROPOSAL- A SOME OF WHICH MORE TAILORED HIS SMALL BUSINESS- OPENED DEFINITELY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS TO EQUITY- AND REALLY PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THAT THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED. REALLY NEED THANK YOU AND JUST. MY LAST. COMMENT MORE THAN ANY I I'D KNOW MY CALL FROM SO CRUZ. OF TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE AGE OF. I EVER A LOT HOW THE FUNDING FOR THE- VERY FIRST OR- FIRST. TO INCENTIVIZE. OF PROPOSALS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR YOUTH TO. GO BACK TO- IN PERSON LEARNING- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ARE. ALL WE'RE DOING THERE IS ADVANCING THE MONEY WE'RE NOT REALLY ADDING TO THE POT OF MONEY- AND WHAT OUR SCHOOLS NEED- THEY WANT TO OPEN UP. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE OPEN UP THEY WANT OUR CHILDREN TO GO BACK TO FACE TO FACE BUT THEY WANTED TO IN A SAFE WAY. THAT TAKES A LOT MORE MONEY THAN WHAT IS. THE NORMAL BUDGET HERE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR AS WELL WE CAN COMPETE. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO DO HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO. GO BACK TO OF FACE TO FACE LEARNING. SO I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS WE HAVE DOLE AND ALL OF A SENATOR CASE. THANK YOU A MAN CHAIR- WELL MEMBERS I. JUST ONE AND A HALF TO MAKE A FEW KEY TO WITH- IT'S REALLY NICE HAVE A- THE- FORMER SECRETARY RESOURCES- HERE SO- I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT FIRE I'M SURE. ALSO THE SENATOR FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT WILL COVER THOSE ISSUES BUT I WANTED. TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE BUDGET IS A- IS WHERE OUR PRIORITIES ARE AND WE LAID OUT AND THERE'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN FOR I'M THE FOR SPEAKER TODAY AND THE THREE BEFORE ME. HAVE A COMMON THEME THAT I PICKED UP ON AND THAT IS. THE FACT THAT- WE MORE DETAIL AND I WANT TO BRING THAT UP I WANT TO TALK ABOUT I'M GONNA BRING UP TWO ISSUES- TWO ITEMS THAT I. BELIEVE OR AT LEAST THE HOTTEST ITEMS IN IN THAT I'VE HEARD IN MY DISTRICT AND NUMBER ONE I KNOW THAT- THE VICE CHAIR BROUGHT UP THE EDT BUT I WANT TO SHARE THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TEN MONTHS. AND IS PANDEMIC. OKAY AND- I CANNOT TELL YOU THE THOUGHT AND DOLLARS OF CALLS I HAVE GOTTEN IN MY OVER THE D. AND WE'RE STILL RIGHT WILL WRAP SO I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT- WASN'T BROUGHT UP BY THE VICE CHAIR- MANY BUSINESSES OUT THERE- AS YOU KNOW- THOSE OF US WHO ACTUALLY DO A PAYROLL EVERY TWO WEEKS- AND HAVE EMPLOYEES THOSE THAT ARE LEFT IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE STILL DOING BUSINESS- HAVE TO PAY. FOR THIS- THE IN BENEFITS THE WE HAVE TO PAY THEM BACK THEIR STIR TO MY KNOWLEDGE. FOR EIGHT POINT THREE BILL DOLLARS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- HAS GIVEN TO CALIFORNIA. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT OF THAT. ARE WE RECOVERY GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY THAT BACK AS WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. IT TOOK US SOME ALMOST TEN YEARS TO GET THAT PAID BACK SO THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I ALSO. A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT ALSO IS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FRAUD AT- THERE WAS ALREADY THERE IS A- THE. THE TV. THIS MORNING AND- OUTLET THE TALK ABOUT TO BE. DOLLARS AND I THINK THAT. MAY BE LOW MAY A BILL SO. ARE WE GONNA BE. TO BACK THE EIGHT DOLLAR OR TWO DOLLARS FOR SURE. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE FORTY EIGHT POINT. THREE THAT'S MY FIRST- QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR- SO IN REGARDS TO. THE BORROWING WHEN STATE FARM FROM THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND- IT IS- BASICALLY A- THAT WOULD WILL BE REPAYING THAT STATE WILL. ANY INTO. ON THAT AND SO WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AN AMOUNT OF- OH FIVE FIFTY FIVE. MILLION TO REPAY THAT ON THE LAW. HOWEVER THAT THE NOT TAKE COULD. THE NEW DATE THAT- WAS IMPLEMENTED REGARDS THE FEDERAL. SO THAT WILL BE A- AS MARAVICH. BUT- GENERALLY HOW WORKS IS THE EMPLOYER ARE PAYING INTO THIS. FOR ON BEHALF OF THEIR- AND SO THESE ARE. DE THAT HAVE BEEN- TAKEN OUT BE REPAID- THROUGH FUTURE- EMPLOYER. KIND ON BEHALF OF THEIR. YES I UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL PAYING AND I'M PART OF THAT. WAS WHAT ABOUT THE FROM I MEAN THERE BILLIONS OF FRAUD. AS I BE PASSED ON TO THE BUSINESS. I MEAN I HAVE A QUESTION I TO MY CALL DANIEL. HI DANIEL BRANDED WITH THE OF THANK YOU SENATE DOLLY FOR CLASS. AND WE ARE STILL LOOKING INTO YOUR- WHAT CAN BE DONE- I'M NOT A THE TOPIC FRANKLY EDT RECKONS AS DISCUSSION I CAN TAKE YOUR- QUESTION BACK- PROVIDE MORE DETAIL DURING THE HEARING. OKAY THANK YOU I JUST WANNA TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT. YOU KNOW LOOK IF I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE BIZ SECTION THERE'S SOME BIG RELIEF BUT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A BIT SIMILAR- THAT WOULD BE A GREAT. YOU TO STAR IS NOT. REQUIRE THEM TO PAY. DEFINITELY NOT THE FRAUD BUT THERE ARE MANY BUSINESSES GOING THAT ARE NOT BEEN ANYMORE SO THAT PUT THE BIRD EVEN. SO ON THOSE REMAIN BUSINESS AND CAL. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE I THANK GOD FACT THAT HAVE. MAKE IT NATIONAL. A WORLDWIDE CAL. BASED IN CAL. WE WOULD NOT THIS NGUYEN. IF WE'RE RELYING ON THE- DEVAS. SMALL THAT ARE THAT BEEN. JUST DESTROYED BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE WOULD BE IN VERY TOUGH SHAPE TODAY. WITHOUT I WANT TO MOVE ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION- AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FOLKS THAT ARE IMPACTED THE MOST BY THE- THE- THIS PANDEMIC. HAS BEEN ELDERLY WHICH I BELIEVE IS TRUE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR YOUNG FOLKS WHO. HAVE BEEN IMPACTED AND I THINK THAT. THE AS A FATHER OF. THREE CHILDREN THAT ARE STILL ATTENDING TO IN COLLEGE AND ONE. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING- MENTALLY- AND WE NEED TO GET THESE KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL NO DOUBT THEY NEED TO BE IT. LEARNING IN SCHOOL- BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS- THE A BIG PART OF MY DISTRICT IS. BROADBAND NOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FEDERAL MONEY. THAT HAS BEEN- ALLOCATED TO BROADBAND BUT- AND WE'VE DONE LEGISLATION I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED ON IT MYSELF. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT IS A QUICK ENOUGH. THE BY THE TIME YOU BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO GET WHERE WE'RE GOING THESE WE'VE LOST THESE KIDS- SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST. SHARE THAT I THINK THERE'S MAYBE SOME OPPORTUNITIES AND MAYBE A VOUCHER PROGRAM OR ACTUALLY HELP SOME OF THESE. PARENTS PAY FOR THEIR INTERNET- SO THEIR KIDS CAN ACTUALLY DISTANCE LEARN IN THESE AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE. A PERSONAL THEIR DISADVANTAGE IN THIS IS NOT JUST FOR RULERS. THIS IS FOR. PEOPLE THAT ARE. EVEN HAVE ACCESS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO. PURCHASE IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT A VOUCHER PROGRAM- MAYBE RUN IT THROUGH THE SCHOOL SO THAT WE CAN. ALLOW THESE. STUDENTS TO A DISTANCE LEARN SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THT I. REALLY WOULD THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. AS OUR IS THAT BROADBAND- BECAUSE THE LONG TERM BROADBAND FIXES IS YEARS TO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE THE IT JUST HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT CAN'T- AFFORDED. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT-SENATOR AND- BROADBAND OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE BROWN BET BROADENING. HAS BEEN- UNDER HIGHLIGHTED DURING THIS PANDEMIC AS BOOKS HAVE BEEN MOVING TO TELEWORK AND KIDS TO TELL THE SCHOOL AND- TELEHEALTH- AND WE- TO ENGAGE IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS ISSUE. WE THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SOMETHING- AND I. YOUR YOUR VOUCHER I'LL PLAN IS WELL TAKEN UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILLBE. THERE THERE MAY BE SOME CITIES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE CONNECTIVITY NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE DISCUSSIONS ON THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST COMMENT- IN THE AREA IF WE BURN. FOUR MILLION. ACRES LAST YEAR. AND I TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT. SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES IS A SQUARE MILE SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH ON HOW MANY MILLIONS OF SQUARE MILES OF CALIFORNIA WAS BURKE LAST YEAR. I JUST WANNA SHARE THAT I THINK THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS THAT TOO MUCH MONEY GOES THE AGENCIES AND NOT ENOUGH TO. THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER AVENUES THAT WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THIS MONEY. MORE EFFICIENTLY QUICKER AND GET MORE DONE ON THE GROUND BECAUSE WE'RE UPPING ITS CLOCK WE ARE DEFINITELY IN A DROUGHT- SHOWING SIGNS OF DROUGHT RIGHT NOW A FOR THIS NEXT FIRE SEASON AND WE NEED TO GET THIS MONEY DISTRIBUTED AND GET THESE PROJECTS TAKING CARE OF SO THAT'S JUST A- AN IDEA. THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO INCORPORATE IN- IMPLEMENTING THE FUNDS THAT- YOU'VE ALLOCATED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY WILL NOW GO TO SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A COUPLE AREAS- ON THE LANDLORD TENANT SIDE. DO WE HAVE INFORMATION YET OR THEY CAN BE SURE TO US- REACHED BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN SUBCOMMITTEE START TO MEET ON. ESSENTIALLY ON THE ON THE APPROPRIATIONS ROUTING. FROM FEDERAL STIMULUS. INTO THE STATE'S. AND OR THE COUNTIES- AND- HOW MUCH DISCRETION THE STATE'S GOING TO HAVE OVER THAT PROCESS THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION- AND A SUB PART OF THAT- THE QUESTION IS. DO WE KNOW HOW PRESCRIPTIVE THE USE OF THAT THOSE DOLLARS. IS SURE THAT'S THE BOOK IS UNDERSTANDABLE REFLECTED IN THIS PROPOSED. OBVIOUSLY I THINK ANYBODY I WOULD ASSUME ANYBODY AND- A RASH ON RATIONAL MINDSET WOULD SAY THAT 90% OR- THE BULK OF THOSE DOLLARS NEEDS TO GO TO CASH PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO RENT IN ALL CASES BUT WE'RE SEEING ALREADY PROJECTIONS OF SHORTFALLS BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS THAT ARE GONNA REMAIN UNRESOLVED. AND I'M WONDERING. WHETHER OR NOT. THE DOLLARS ARE GONNA COME PRESCRIBED IN SUCH A WAY THAT ANY PART OF IT CAN BE USED. TO SUPPORT LANDLORD TENANT MEDIATION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE TO HELP RESOLVE- THOSE ALTERNATELY THOSE LANDLORD TENANT. DEFAULTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THE SENATOR AND AT THIS POINT WE'RE EXPECTING TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL RELIEF TO COME TO CALIFORNIA OF WHICH- ONE POINT FOUR OR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WILL COME STRAIGHT WILL COME TO THE STATE- AND ONE POINT THREE THE REMAINDER WILL GO STRAIGHT TO LOCALITIES WITH. POPULATIONS OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE- IT EVERY DAY I FEEL LIKE THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED- AND FOR THE DETAILS- I GET HANDED OVER CALLING ANIMAL BUT I MONEY TO ALSO THAT- YOU KNOW THIS IS IN TERMS OF- HOW IT STRUCK- WE DO WATCH. ALSO ABOUT A YOU KNOW THE- LET'S JUST THE DOLLAR THAT'S FOR IS NOT NECESSARY- WHAT IS- NEEDED A OUT THERE AND I THIS IS NOT A THE PROPOSAL NOT A TO FOR THAT. BUT IT IS TO PROVIDE- SO RELIEF TO LAND- ENTER- AND IN REGARDS TO YOUR MIND- WELL THERE WAS SOME DOLLARS. FOR LANDLORD AND TENANT- MEDIATION AND I ADD THAT WE DO HAVE SOME MONEY- IN YEAR'S FOR THAT- FROM THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE THAT. AND AGAIN HAVE A MORE FROM MICHAEL BUT JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT AS WELL AS THERE'S MILLION IN IN THE CURRENT BY FOR. THE COURTS IN HER CAR TO- SMALL CLAIM ISSUE THAT WILL COME UP AS A OF THE THIRTY FIVE EARLIER IN THE FALL SO I HAVE THAT OVER ONE OF COLLEAGUES SOME MORE. THANK YOU. THE STATE- OBVIOUSLY CONVERSATIONS- ARE CONTINUING AND FLUID RIGHT NOW- WE'RE HAVING WITH- YOU KNOW. THE THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW BEST TO APPROACH THAT AND IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW AN EVICTION- MORATORIUM EXTENSION- WERE EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH- BUT ONE OF OUR GOALS OBVIOUSLY ONE IS TO PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR THE RENTERS BUT ALSO GETTING THESE- CRITICAL- SUPPORTS TO THE TEN AND- LANDLORDS- AS THE- FEDERAL FUNDS ARE FLOWING TO THE STATES SO. WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL OF GETTING THOSE DOLLARS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEY COULD START TO COME TO THE STATE AS EARLY AS THE END OF THE MONTH- ALSO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH- THE SACK IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES TO EXPLORE AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THE LOCALS HAVE RESPONDED TO USING THEIR DOLLARS AND OTHER SIERRA DOLLARS- TO SUPPORT TENANTS AND LANDLORDS AND SO. IT'S OUR GOAL TO- NOT ONLY- TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND NOT RECREATE THE WHEEL HERE BUT ALSO PROVIDE. OPTIONS FOR THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS IN THAT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO STAND UP A PROGRAM BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM SOME STRUCTURE TO QUICKLY PIVOT. AND TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS THE TENANTS AND LANDLORDS- ALSO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AS PART OF THE- THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE- THE BULK OF THESE DOLLARS ARE ARE TARGETED TOWARDS- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. EIGHTY OR BELOW AT AREA MEDIAN INCOME- WITH THE EMPHASIS ON IS A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON THOSE AREAS- FOR. PAYING THOSE RAGES SEVENTY TWO YEAR POINT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING THOSE A RESURGENCE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THOSE CLEANED OFF THE BOOKS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFORE WE START FOCUSING ON THE- PERSPECTIVE PAYMENTS. FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND SO MANY OF THESE SUPPORTS ARE GOING TO BE GOING DIRECT- TARGETED DIRECTLY TO THE LANDLORDS. BUT ALSO- THE PROGRAM IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH- THAT THE GUIDANCE FROM THE FED IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO THE EXTENT THAT LANDLORDS ARE MOVING FORWARD. WITH REQUESTED THESE DOLLARS THAT THE TENANTS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR THOSE- THOSE DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF THEIR LANDLORDS- IN ADDITION ALSO TO- MY COLLEAGUES- A REFERENCE TO THE NOW. MORE SETTLEMENT. DOLLARS DIDN'T WAS PROVIDE A NICE YEAR'S BUDGET- WOULD A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION IN- SETTLEMENT FUNDS THAT WAS ADDED AND- THERE WAS- APPROPRIATED IN THE BUDGET- MANY MUCH OF THAT IS GOING TO BE GOING. TOWARDS THE BOAT WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION IS GOING TO BE GOING TOWARDS- COUNSELING SERVICES SO RENTERS. AND HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECALL I'M THROUGH A LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO I REQUEST COUNSELING SERVICES TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE HOW TO REFI. AND HOW TO ADDRESS- A RARE CHASE- IN ADDITION THE OTHER THIRTY ONE MILLION. IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED FOR- LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR RENTERS TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- I'M- SO. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS FEEL BETTER DRESSED- THE BULK OF YOUR QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD. THE TICKET ADDRESS A LOT OF THEM THE WILL CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS- OFFLINE OF COURSE. I STILL THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I WAS ASKING ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT- THE STIMULUS DOLLARS PROSUMER DOLLARS ARE FUNGIBLE ENOUGH TO BE DEPLOYED- IN IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE- MEDIATION TYPE WORK THAT WE WERE BOTH JUST TALKING ABOUT IS. IS JUST- STILL UNRESOLVED IN MY MIND SO- ITSELF DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE TOO WORRIED ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY'S GONNA COME FROM SO- MAYBE THAT'S A NON ISSUE BUT- THANKS I'M STILL ON RESULT. ON THAT I COULD I COULD TAKE- MORE OF THE RISK. OF IS THERE A GONNA PULL BACK. MAYBE TO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET HERE- IN. BERMAN **** BECAUSE SIMPLY WITH REGARD TO TOO COLD A- NOT NOT ANYTHING ELSE IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T NEED A HI NEW HERE BUT I DON'T THINK I NEED A CIVICS LESSON ON- THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROPRIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO KOBE BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY POWERS OF. OF THE STATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE ON THE EXECUTIVE SIDE THERE'S SOME QUESTION IN MY MIND. AS TO. YOU KNOW WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN- AS WE PROCEED ON THIS BUDGET PATH. BETWEEN WHAT REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. OF VERSES OF WHAT. CLEARLY FALLS IN. THE CATEGORY OF EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE POWERS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS. OF FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES AROUND TRANSPARENCY ISSUES- OF A ROPE AROUND- DEPLOYMENT FOR COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN WOULD WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- YOUR RESPECTIVE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED TO. DEPLOY THOSE DOLLARS FOR MERCY PURPOSES- IN THE LARGER SCHEME AND I'M JUST WONDERING MAYBE FROM THE L. A. O. WITH I HAVE TO BELIEVE AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY IN THE ALEJO'S OFFICE SAT DOWN AND STARTED TO. CHECK THAT OUT OR FIGURE THAT OUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO ME OBVIOUSLY TO OTHERS. OF WHICH- WOULD WOULD WOULD AT LEAST IN A TOP LINE SORT OF FASHION START TO SEPARATE THAT OUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT PROBABLY BECAUSE- OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS- EXPEDIENCY. COOLEY OF THE MERCIES. UNKNOWNS ABOUT HOW LONG THIS PANDEMIC WAS GONNA LAST SAID. BUT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN. A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN OPERATION HERE- IN AND CERTAINLY HOPE WATER THAT CONTINUES BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW. WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN AT SOME POINT IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO. GET MORE PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE DONE. YES SENATOR I THINK- THIS IS A IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND WE HAVE- YES SOME OF THE SEVENTEEN- IT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON AT THE- IN CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED IN ADVANCE BECAUSE IT AS YOU NOTED IT'S IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY AND SO. PART OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING HERE IS TO INCLUDE SOME CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD ALLOW. THE ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY WITH SHIFTING SOME OF THE FUNDS AROUND AFTER- BUDGET ENACTMENT- WITH THAT SAID I THINK I HAVE A COLLEAGUE DREW SODERBERG WHO IS AVAILABLE HERE AND CAN PROBABLY PROVIDE A BIT MORE- AS A DETAILED RESPONSE FOR YOU. YEAH AND IF IT'S TOO DETAILED I CAN TAKE IT OFFLINE I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE ANYWAY. THANK YOU. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BASICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION- HAS PROVIDED AN OVERALL FRAMEWORK FOR HOW THEY PLAN TO FIND A CODEX THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN CODE EXPENDITURES- IN THE COMING BUDGET YEAR R. ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OF THIS IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTAL BUDGETS HOWEVER- AS MR PADDOCK MENTIONED THE- THEY ARE PROPOSING CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SHIFT FUNDS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVED THOSE ALLOCATIONS IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION- IS RESERVING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN- AN OFF BUDGET BUDGET ITEM THAT THEY COULD ACCESS TO FURTHER SUPPLEMENT THEIR CODE RESPONSE EFFORTS IN ADDITION IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE EXPENDITURES MANY MUCH OF THE- SITTING SENATORS ON COVERED RESPONSE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE- DISASTER RECOVERY AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT THREE- OH- AND THE AUTHORIZATION TO USE THE FUNDS INJURY- OFFER CODE RESPONSE ARE EXPIRING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO USE TRIO- IN THE FUTURE YEARS AND GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEND- WELL BEYOND THE. ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION PROPOSED. ARE IN THE IN THE- FISCALLY- IT COMES TO DREAM OF THE- THE CURRENT A STORE ALLOW IN OF REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO. THE MUCH ONE FINE ARE BEING. TRANSFERRED INTO ALL OF THERE'S NO REQUIRE FOR. ON HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY SPENT ON. HOW WHERE THEIR THEIR% ULTIMATELY ALLOCATED HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DESPITE THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THEY HAVE COMMITTED. TO PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH THIS INFORMATION ON A MONTHLY BASIS- AND- HAD DONE SO FOR THE MOST PART THE HAVE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH MONTHLY REPORTS ON ON HOW IT'S SPENDING THE FUNDS. THAT ARE BEING ALLOCATED FOR PUBLIC RESPONSE. THURMOND WHAT AGAIN WOULD YOU. SUGGEST THAT I CAN TAKE THIS INTO- YOU KNOW LATER ON AT SOME POINT IN TIME BUT- I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING IS- IN TO LOOK AT IN REVERSE IS ONCE. THE ABOVE THE AMHERST NY MERCY DECORATION IS- HAS RUN ITS COURSE. WHICH POWERS OF APPROPRIATIONS. IT CAN LEGISLATIVE POWERS RETURN TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT ESSENTIALLY BEEN. YOU KNOW SEATED TO THOSE OVERSEE CARS AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT'S ANOTHER WAY FOR ME TO FIND OUT. WHAT WHAT LAUGHTER JURISDICTION AND WHAT'S GOING TO COME BACK AT SOME POINT SO I CAN. POP UP LIKE THAT. A TO THIS ON THESE ONGOING BUDGET DECISIONS OR SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE SO I JUST LIKE TO GET THAT. FINISH UP CAR OR GET THAT INFORMATION AT SOME POINT AFTER TODAY I KNOW TODAY'S AN OVERVIEW IT'S NOT INTENDED. FOR A DEEP DIVE. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSES THAT YOU PROVIDED SO FOR- SIMILARLY FOR ME TO SELL US FOR MAYBE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE PROVIDED TO DOCUMENT A LESSER SOME OBJECTION- IN IN THE IN THE LARGER REVENUE DISCUSSION- I APPRECIATED THAT I. THINK WE WERE GIVEN SOME HIGH POINTS AS TO WHY THINGS ARE THE FEAR BY THE FISCAL PROJECTIONS ARE BETTER NOW THAN THEY WERE. I DIDN'T HEAR A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES WHAT THE- PROJECTIONS WERE- FIFTEEN PERSONS WHERE THEY ARE NOW- IN FACT WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR THAT I'VE SEEN ANYTHING ON ON SALES TAXES AS WELL IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET THIS SOMETHING WHAT IS A BAR CHART OR A PIE CHART OR SOMETHING ON A ONE PAGER THAT SHOWS US- THEN. VERSUS NOW IN TERMS OF. LAST SUMMER LAST SUMMER'S PROJECTIONS VERSUS VERSUS NOW PARTICULARLY AND WHAT PROPERTY TAX ACTUAL SERBIAN FOR EXAMPLE VERSUS WHAT. CHANGES WERE PROJECTED TO A PATH TO OCCUR WHEN THIS- BUDGET WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED THIS CURRENT BUDGET. YEAH I'M JUST LOOKING FOR YES OR NO ALL OF THAT AN BE PROVIDED MORE FOR MYSELF AND FOR. WE CAN PROVIDE THAT HERE STAFF HUNTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SIMILARLY I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND. OVERALL OF HOW THE HOMELESS FUNDING THAT'S PROPOSED AT THIS POINT IN THE BUDGET IS. IS BROKEN DOWN BETWEEN PERMANENT HOUSING WHAT WILL. LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT HOUSING VERSUS SHORT TERM SHELTER. NEEDS I'M JUST LOOKING FOR TAKING THE NUMBERS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE BEEN SPLITTING THEM INTO THOSE TWO CATEGORIES IS THAT ALSO POSSIBLE TO GET. AFTER TODAY. I'M SURE I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT BY IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FOR ACQUISITION OF- OF UNITS AND SO WE SEE THAT AS A MORE PERMANENT BUT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR- OVERALL SPENDING AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING TOWARDS- SUCH THINGS AS YOU KNOW THE LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS VERSUS- MAYBE SHELTERS IS THAT RIGHT YES SOME OF THE FOR EXAMPLE SURPRISE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS- IT THAT. HAD EVEN TAKE THAT HAVE BEEN- PUT FORDERT. RANGE FROM A PURCHASING. A SHORT TERM- HOUSING- FACILITIES- BY WAY OF TAKING OVER MOTELS. FOR EXAMPLE OR EXISTING FACILITIES THAT CAN BE USED TO GET PEOPLE. IN AND OUT. OUT OF. OUT OF HARM'S WAY INTO TEMPORARY SHELTER AND THEN AT SOME POINT PRESUMABLY ON A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND THEN THERE'S PERMIT SUPPORTED HOUSING FUNDING WHICH IS ACTUALLY CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN. NEW APARTMENTS TYPICALLY FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME FOLKS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BOTH IN THIS BUDGET FOR TO WHAT EXTENT. THERE'S RESOURCES FOR THOSE TWO. FOR THOSE TWO WORLDS GOOD TO HAVE- TO BE FUNDED. AND THEY'RE THERE YEAH WE CAN WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND GET YOU SOME MORE INFORMATION THERE ARE THERE ARE ONGOING- PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FOR SOME OF THIS AND NOT NEW PROPOSALS AND SO WE CAN- BREAK THAT DOWN FOR YOU. SUPER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN LASTLY ON THE- THE HIT THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. I APPRECIATE THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED IN. I MEAN JUST. I DON'T HAVE GREAT CONCERNS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE INADEQUATE ON A ON A ONE YEAR BASIS JUST ON THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE TYPE OF CALCULATION MY OWN PART- HOWEVER. THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD BEST REPLICATE THIS IN SENATE DISTRICT FIFTEEN IS A THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM IN JUST ONE COUNTY SO. DEPENDING ON HI YOU EXTRAPOLATE THESE PROGRAMS AND OBVIOUSLY HOW MANY HOW MUCH NEED THERE IS- I I'M NOT CLEAR AS TO WHETHER THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS ENOUGH THAT SAID. HAZARD IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY WIDELY KNOWN THAT THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY THAT'S GONE UNUSED IN THE STATE- FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION HAVE. IN THIS IS REALLY FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAVE HAVE WE LOOKED AT. WHETHER OR NOT THE THAT SORT OF DOLLARS RATHER THAN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS- CAN CAN AUGMENT THIS NEED. THE SAME NEED. ADD THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE AVAILABILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FINDS- I THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- DOLLARS THAT CAN BE USED TOWARDS MENTAL HEALTH- GENERALLY CAN BE BRAID BRAIDED AND COMPLEMENTARY AND TO THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ARE. OF THE FOUR HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED WOULD BE GENERAL FUND AND- BELIEVE THE REST WOULD BE- THROUGH. THAT ACCOUNT- RECOUP ITS BUT I WILL DEFER TO OF- MY COLLEAGUE RYAN MILLER FOR MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT- YES THE- THE DOLLARS- THERE IS ANOTHER PROPOSAL ACTUALLY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL- AND THAT DOES. NOT PROVIDE EMERGENCY DOLLARS FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH- BUT GENERALLY THERE'S ALSO- FLEXIBILITY THAT REPORTING IN THE OR PROPOSING IN THE BUDGET ACT- THE MAIL OFFERS MAURICE'S OF THAT MUCH IF THEY DOLLARS A SMILE BUT I WILL TURN OVER FOR MORE DETAIL- TO FINALLY. HEY THANK YOU RYAN MILLER- I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ACTUAL I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A- OF. FREE AND RELATIVE. I WOULD SAY THAT THE INVESTMENT DOES BUILD ON RECENT- AUGMENTATIONS IN RECENT YEARS FOR SIMILAR MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES- I THINK NOTABLY. FIFTY MILLION I THINK IN THE- TWENTY- NINETEEN BUDGET ACT I WANT TO SAY- SO- YOU KNOW I. I THINK THAT- WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THE PROPOSED. I HAVE A COLLEAGUE I REALLY I DON'T RAMOS WHO COULD SPEAK MORE TO THAT. YEAH I DON'T LIKE TO FOLLOW UP LATER THAT'S ALL I HAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANDSORRY FOR THE LINK THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WILL TAKE FIVE SIMPLE QUESTIONS WHEN A WHEN A ROOM DOWN BUT- LITTLER THANK YOU. CENTER CORTESE AND THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT LOOK THIS IS OUR FIRST. BUDGET HEARING AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN- WERE ALSO JUST RETURNING BACK AFTER A BREAK AND WE ARE AWARE. OF THE DEMANDS THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE- THE NEEDS THEY ARE FEELING DID MANAGE THEY ARE. REQUESTING IN ITS- I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US OBVIOUSLY TO GET OUR QUESTIONS OUT THERE BECAUSE THEN. NOT ONLY DO ALL OF US IS COLLEAGUES KNOW WHAT'S ON EACH OF OUR MINDS WE ALSO THAT- DICK THE ADMINISTRATION DOES. AND SO I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE THAT YES THIS HEARING ON MAY TAKE SOME TIME BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS HAVE GREAT QUESTIONS. AND SO WHAT I WOULD DO NOW IS JUST LIST TO YOU THE ORDER THAT I HAVE AND I HOPE WE HAVE CAUGHT EVERYONE. THAT WE WILL NEXT GO TO SENATOR MCGUIRE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WHITE CASKEY FOLLOWED BY SENATOR STERN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MEN. THEN SENATOR EGGMAN THAN SENATOR NEWMAN THEN SENATOR CAFIERO AND THEN SENATOR PAM. SO MISTER. MCGUIRE GO AHEAD. THANK SO MUCH AND GET A MADAM CHAIR A GOOD AFTERNOON REPRESENT FROM BOTH THE A. O. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE- WOULD LIKE BE ABLE TO ADVANCE SYSTEM COMMON SENSE OF QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION RESPONSE. FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. CANDIDLY WE'VE BEEN REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS CALFIRE. RELATED TO FIRE RESPONSE AND WHAT HER RESPONSE A PREVENTION. IT IS BEING CRYSTAL CLEAR EVEN THOUGH THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF A FIRE FIGHTING FORCE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT THEY'RE SHORT STAFFED- AND THEY NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT. THIS ERA OF MEGA FIRES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN. YEAR AFTER YEAR. WE'VE ADVANCE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ENGINES BECAUSE AND RETAIN PERSONNEL. NOT AS WELL AS DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE PREVENTION FOR EXAMPLE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHAT WE KNOW IS CAO FIRES. STAFFING CAL FIGHTERS STAFFING. ACTUALLY HIT RECORD NUMBERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IN IT HAS YET TO RECOVER FROM OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. IN THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWENTY TWENTY. WAS A RECORD BREAKING FIRE SEASON THAT FOR THE STATE FIFTEEN OF OUR LARGEST FIRES OF ALL CURTAIN THE LAST DECADE IN PHARMACYNEED SEASON IS NOW NEARLY EIGHTY DAYS LONGER THAN IT WAS BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE SUBMITTED ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SUBMITTED A REQUEST ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FOUR MILLION TO HIRE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL BOTH FULL TIME AND SEASONAL FOR CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT WAS GOING TO BE NEEDED. TO HELP STAFF AND EQUIP A MODERN DAY FIRE FIGHTING FORCE. NOW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE TOLD WE WERE TOLD BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO EXPAND TO THE LEVEL THAT WE WERE SUGGESTING. THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR NOT ENOUGH- NOT ENOUGH OF ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET FIRE ENGINES IN A RAPID MANNER. BY NOT ENOUGH CREW QUARTERS A TAKES TIME TO BETTER TRAIN UP FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS. AND IT TAKES TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT IN. NOW THIS YEAR. D. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS PROPOSING MOSTLY SEASONAL I MIGHT ADD SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN POSITIONS. IN THE MEANTIME THE COMMUNITIES OF THE NORTH COAST HAS CONTINUED TO BURN. THE LARGEST WILDLAND FIRE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE SCORCHED MILLION ACRES THIS YEAR. THE GLASS FIRE THE WALBRIDGE FIRE RAGED THROUGH SONOMA AND NAPA COUNTIES. WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING. HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE HOW IS IT POSSIBLE. NOW. TO BRING ON THIS ADDITIONAL STAFFING THE WE'VE BEEN REQUESTING QUITE CANDIDLY AND YOU CAN HEAR MY INCREDIBLE FRUSTRATION AND YES ANGER. THANK YOU ALL SAID WE COULDN'T DO BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IS READY WE CAN DO IT IN TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE OF CONSTRAINTS AND AGAIN IN THE MEANTIME. COMMUNITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO BURN. SO THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS ONE WHY THIS YEAR. WHY NOT PREVIOUS YEARS TO HAS THE MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED BEING SPENT I IN REGARDS TO THE STAFFING INCREASES THAT THAT WAS SETTLED ON LAST YEAR THREE FOR THE EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR ON THE FIRE PREVENTION SIDE. HOW MANY ADDITIONAL ACRES DO YOU ANTICIPATE IS GOING TO BE DEALT WITH BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR MY UNDERSTANDING FROM READING THE BUDGET IT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY- EXPEDITED ENVIRONMENT EXPEDITED EDUCATION MANAGEMENT- PROJECT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE WHAT THAT MEANS IN ACRES. AND IT DOES CAL FIRE CURRENTLY HAVE THE SUFFICIENT STAFFING TO DO THIS EARLY ACTION WORK OR Y'ALL NEED ADDITIONAL BANDWIDTH TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE ADDITIONAL MOSTLY MOSTLY SEASONED FIREFIGHTERS ON THANK YOU SO MUCH VENTURE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THESE. FOUR OR FIVE QUESTIONS PLEASE. IF. ONE HUNDRED SENATOR MCGUIRE- HERE I HEAR YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M IN JUST ONCE- RELAY TO THE THAT WE DO HAVE A FORTY THREE MILLION GENERAL IS THE THIRTY NEW SAFETY SETS OF THEM ARE CAL FIRE OTHERS OF ARE CONSERVATION CORPS- WE ALSO INCLUDE FORTY EIGHT MILLION TWO. BLACKROCK HELICOPTERS IN OUR TANK. AND THROUGH OUR ONE BILLION I'M A FIRE FORTUNATELY AND SEE- PACKAGE REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS- BASED ON. WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THIS RECORD- FIRE SEASON IN REGARDS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I WILL HAND IT OVER TO ALISON HEWITT. I SENATOR MCGUIRE ALISON TO IT HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO ANSWER AND- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSED. AND IT'S TO THE ANSWER OF WHY THIS YEAR AND NOT LAST YEAR I DO WANT TO JUST RECALL IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND SPECIFIC WE BELIEVE STAFFING PROPOSAL THAT CAME FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA. ADDED EIGHTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET IN PART OF THAT IS TO FIND PERMANENT POSITIONS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE- LEGACY STAFFING FOR HEALTHCARE. AND HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. WITH ALL THE RESPECT WITH YOU IT ON THAT ISSUE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS. AND SO WHAT THAT ENHANCES ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED FIFTY FULL TIME STAFFERS A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT WE NEEDED THIS MONEY BACK WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED THIS SPENDING MONEY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT DID NOT HIT THE MARK FOR WHAT WAS BEING REQUESTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EVEN LAST YEAR AND AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO. INTERRUPT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL BUT WHERE MY FRUSTRATION IS ON THE GROUND IS THAT THE FIRE SEASONS CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND WORSE WE KNOW IT'S GONNA GET WORSE HERE IN THE YEARS TO COME IN YOUR HEARING MY FRUSTRATION IN YES AT TIMES ANGER BECAUSE- WE KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO GO. BUT FOR SOME REASON AGAIN I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD NOT ENOUGH CREW QUARTERS. NOT IN A FIRE ENGINE TO TAKES TWO YEARS TO BE A TO GET A FIRE ENGINE. IT TAKES TIME TO BETTER TRAIN UP FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS. IT TAKES TIME TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE TRAINING- APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED ALL THE APPLICATIONS IN BAND WITH. THE WHEN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN JUST ANSWER DIRECTLY WHY THIS. YEAR NOT OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. ALL TRAINS. ALSO HELP TO FOLLOW WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THE TO FOCUS. THE THERE'S BEEN A- IN A FOCUS- WITHIN THE IN. FOR BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. AS WELL AS NEW AIRCRAFT NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND SUFFERING TO THAT NEW LARGER TANKERS. SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE'RE TRYING TO INTEGRATE AS MUCH. TECHNOLOGY AS MANY RESOURCES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN OTHER BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS I THINK IS THE BEST WAY THAT. I CAN RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION HAPPY TO IT TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND OTHERWISE. AND WE HAVE ADDED SOME PERMANENT STAFF BEING WE'VE ADDED ADDITIONAL FIRE ENGINES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY COMMITTED TO ENHANCING THE STATE'S WILDFIRE RESPONSE AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON NOT. AND BUT JUST WHEN IT'S LIKE THAT WE HAVE ADDED. AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN RECENT RECENT BUDGET CYCLES. AND GET HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S ARGUING IN IN AGAIN. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS DIALOGUE AND I WILL NOT BELABOR THE POINT IN YES I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO GO OFFLINE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IS FAR AS THE BLACKHAWKS IN THE C. ONE THIRTIES THIS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND BUDGET COMMITTEE. WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD A RAMP UP TO BE A TO GET THE BLACKHAWKS IN FROM POLAND TO BE ABLE TO GET IN IN- ON SHORE DOMESTICALLY TO GET THEM INTO- WORKING HERE IN THE STATES. AND ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. IN REGARD TO THE CRUISE FROM CAL FIRE RESPECTFULLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING. EIGHTY FOUR MILLION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. FOR THE CRUISE IN THIRTY ONE CAL FIRE ENGINES- TO BE TO GET THOSE FOLKS SKILLED AND TRAINED AND I. AM BEEN CANDID THE ANSWERS THAT I WAS GIVEN. NOW DON'T SEEM TO BE THAT BIG OF AN ISSUE NOW THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR POSTING ON SEASONAL. BUT WE'RE STILL YET TO HIT OUR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE PEAK IN IT'S JUST INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. WHEN YEAR AFTER YEAR. FORESEEN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BURKE. SO I'M HAPPY TO OFFER. ON THAT- IS WELL EFFECT JUST TRANSITION. TO JUST TWO OTHER. SO DO CAL FIRE HAS JUST. TO DO THE EARLY ACTION WORK. UNDERSTANDING IS YES AND THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER EFFICIENCY IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT INCLUDING CONTRACT EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE THE GOAL PARTICULARLY WITH A THREE HUNDRED AND- THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED FOR EARLY ACTION IS TO GET THOSE PROJECTS ON THE GROUNDS AND STARTED BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON. AND BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF LIFESAVING APPLICATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO HARDEN COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HEALTHCARE IS PREPARED TO AND WILL IMPLEMENT THESE PROJECTS- IN IN- COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND ZACKS ARE ARE UNDERSTANDING AND ADD THAT INSPIRATION IN PUTTING THIS FORWARD HAS THE FULL CONFIDENCE IN UNDERSTANDING THESE PROJECTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE DISCO FIRE HAVE THE BEING WITH AS FAR AS STAFFING TO BE TO GET THESE INDIVIDUALS HIRED AND- EQUIPMENT. PURCHASED ARE YOU SEEN AS THAT A LOT OF THIS WORK WILL BE DONE WITHIN HEALTH FAIRS THE- STOP RESOURCE. AND I'M AGAIN SOMETHING WE- GET BACK TO YOU ON OUR UNDERSTANDING AS THE SOUTH STOPPING NOT BE IN ISSUE FOR THE PURPOSES. GETTING THESE PRESS ON THE GROUND. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE- PERSONALITY BE HIRED IN ADDITION EQUIPMENT IT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE PURCHASED. THIS SO EVERY. THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE IS VERY TARGETED ZERO WHAT IS THAT INDUSTRY'S ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. THERE IS ALSO A PORTION OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION THAT'S TARGETED FOR BUDGET YEAR. SOME OF THAT GROUP WILL AND- REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT HEALTHCARE IS GONNA START. ADVERTISING AND HIRING FOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SUBJECT TO BE EIGHT. THE- BUDGET ACT ITSELF. SO SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IT WILL BE ADDED IN BUDGET YEAR BUT FOR WHAT WE NEED TO GET ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. FOR RATE IS WHAT TRUMPCARE IS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO MAKE A SCALABLE DIFFERENCE BEFORE THE FIRE SINGH FOR THE- BUDGET CHANGE INVOLVES OF CALLING FOR SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POSITIONS AS WELL AS- THAT WILL ADD THOSE ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS- THE GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM ON BY MARCH FIFTEENTH OR WINS THE GOAL TO BE A TO GET TO MINE SINCE THE SEASONAL CONTRACT. CONTRACT. IS MARCH FIFTEENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. THE SO I'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SENATOR MY- HAD TO DO SO. AND SO UP WITH CAL FIRE JUST MAKE A QUICK TO SEE. THAT THE FIRE. THAT WERE PROPOSING FOR BUDGET YOU'RE REALLY ABOUT OF FIRE PROTECTION AND- PREVENT TO PASS. SO LITTLE. **** FROM THE THREE HUNDRED ANDTWENTY TWO MILLION. BUDGET BUT WILL ABOUT PART OF THAT. YEAR AFTER IN MOVING FORWARD BUT LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TERMS OF WHEN CAL FIRE FROM. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR STUFF ON. AND TO START SUPPORTING THE SOUTH. THEY'LL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU- MAY CHAIR IN WILL BE FOLLOWED OVER THE PART FINANCE. YOU'RE WELCOME SENATOR MCGUIRE SO WE'LL GO TO CENTER WHITE HOUSE. AND WE WILL BE FOLLOWING TO SET TWO ON THE- FIRE LOOK FOR TO TALK WITH. A CHIEF. I'M GOING TO SPEAK. THE PESTICIDE CHANGES IN THE BUDGET WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE FEE AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. WHICH STAFF THE SAME WITH THE REFORMS AND DTIC THE NEW- FEES AND OTHERS ARE EMBRACED AND SB FORTY TWO. AS WELL AS- CALCIUM FORMALLY DOCKER THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE THERE THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOUR- ALL- PRIORITY HAZARDOUS WASTE SPOTS WILL BE WORKING WITH THAT. I'M WORKING WITH MY SENATE COLLEAGUES ON A SUPER ENVIRONMENTALLY AND THAT MAY BE OF ASSISTANCE FOR SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S DONE ON- NOT ORPHAN SITES FOR PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE A HOMEOWNER BUT- I AM A PULSE SO OF CAN. ABOUT THE PRIORITIES BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE BUDGET SAY IN ITS SERIOUSNESS OF COMING OUT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED- AND CLIMATE CHANGES IS HERE AND SERIOUS AND WHILE WE'RE ALL KEEN FOR FUNDING- THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS SIXTY C. LEVEL RISE OR THE- FORCE MANAGEMENT OF MY- COLLEAGUE FROM THE- PACIFICA NORTHWEST WAS TALKING ABOUT. THESE ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- ANSWERS IS SIMPLY JUST NOT ENOUGH. WHAT WE NEED IS A STABLE ONGOING A FUNDING SOURCE AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TUNING UP ITS CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND MAKING. IT MAKING IT BETTER THE LAST SUMMER THIS SUBCOMMITTEE TO REPORTED OUT AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE SENATE APPROVED ADOPTING A DIRECTIVE TO A CAL EPA TO CONSIDER CHANGES IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. NOW SECRETARY OF BLUMENFELD RESPOND WITH THE PROPOSES TO FALLS WITH A LETTER COMMITTING CAL EPA TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE US. IN CARB. TO EXAMINE THE PROGRAM'S ROLE IN IT CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE STRATEGY IN ENSURING A COMPREHENSION HAVE. COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. BELL I SEE IN THE PROPOSED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM YOU HAVE. THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS FOR- EQUITIES. BUT THAT'S FINE AND DANDY BUT AB SIX ONE SEVEN IS A POLLUTION PROGRAM IT DOESN'T REDUCE CARBON YOU KNOW YOU GET EXPENSIVE MONITORING EQUIPMENT THAT'S PUT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WE EDUCATE PEOPLE WE GIVE PEOPLE INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT THIS REDUCE CARBON SAFE DRINKING WATER. DOESN'T REDUCE CARBON IMPRINT YOUR PREDECESSOR MISLITOLD US THAT THE CULLIGAN MAN SOCCER TO MAKE THE TRIPS THIS VENTURE YOU SEE THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT SO MY QUESTION IS THE MINISTRATION SERIOUS. ABOUT WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WORKING WITH THE AIRPORT AND IDENTIFYING NEW LEGISLATION. REGULATION CHANGES AND- REVISIONS OF THE SCOPING PLAN TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE STRATEGY. YES THANK YOU SENATOR AND OF COURSE THE MINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ALL OF THOSE GOALS- I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO UPDATE YOU AND ANY PARTICULAR- EVENTS THAT HAPPENED ON TO THAT AFFECTS BUT YES THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TOWARDS COMMON GOALS FOR CAP AND TRADE AND FOR CLIMATE- ACTION. I THINK THIS IS TO RESET COLOR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS YES WE EXPECT- IN DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE AS THEY HAVE BEEN WITH THEIR BOARDS REGULAR UPDATES ON. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS IN THIS MATTER AND WHAT. ON THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING FOR AS FAR AS CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN BUT AS YOU NOTED OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN REALLY DOES FOCUS. ON THE PRIORITIES OF OUR MODEL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC. AS YOU WANTED. I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT ANY CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON REDUCING CARBON WHAT IS THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE SAID HERE'S CHEERS UP TO FOR FOUR YEARS I GOT MY COLLEAGUES TALKING ABOUT FORCE OTHER COLLEAGUE UP FROM LASSEN COUNTY. CENTER STERN COULD BE ON HERE SO WE REALLY THE PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED FOR. A DO GOOD BY A SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF ALL THE ILLS OF CALIFORNIA WE COULD WE COULD I'M SURE PEOPLE THAT NEED DENTAL HEALTH NEED- AN INJECTION OF FREE DENTAL HEALTH BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I MEAN. I'M SURE MY FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO WOULD LOVE TO SEE MONEY COMING OUT TO GIVE TO THE KIDS BUT I'LL MOVE ON I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME SERIOUS DISCUSSION SINCE UP TO. NOW THE YOU HAVE A CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. FROM YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE BRAND NEW I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THEM- AND- YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS THAT. THE L. A. L. HAS TOLD ME ANYTHING FINANCIALLY SAID THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED. OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. AND SOME OF THE PROJECT SECTOR HOLLISTER- THE HELICOPTER PAD THAT WAS PROPOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. I THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE DIDN'T GET BILLED. TWO THOUSAND SIX APPROPRIATE DIDN'T GET BILL NOW YOU GOT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THIS FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. SO IF THE FORECAST IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVE AN OPERATING DEFICIT IN THE FUTURE HOW ARE THESE PROJECTS EVER GOING TO GET FINISHED NO WE START THEM BUT HOW WITH THE- OTHERS. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU COMPLETE THEM. HI AND I CANNOT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN THE CABIN- SORRY IN OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM- LET ME DO THIS INNER. FOR THAT CENTER Y. CASKEY THAT MORE RETOOL POINT OR YOU'RE WANT THEM TO ADDRESS ALL OF THAT. SILICON MEANING YOUR LAST POINT ABOUT HOW TO HOW WE DO WE COMPLETE THEM. WHAT'S THAT MORE AP. ILLUSTRATIVE A RHETORICAL POINT OR WOULD YOU LIKE THEM TO ANSWER THAT NO I MEAN LET'S JUST PICK THE HOLLISTER. HELICOPTER BY KATE AND HOW THIS SAID HOW DOES THAT PROJECT IS. COMPLETE WHERE DOES THE OTHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS COME FROM IF WE GOT A DEFICIT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. OKAY GO AHEAD. M. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HOW YOU TO FUNDED. AFTERNOON MY BIGGEST APARTMENT FINANCED- WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND GET BACK TO YOU. W. GREAT- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE- BILLION DOLLARS SECURITIZED OUR AB EIGHT REGISTRATION FEE- WHAT ARE THE MERITS OF SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARGING A FUEL STATIONS OKAY YOU WANT TO BUILD FUEL STATIONS VERSUS JUST PURCHASING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- I NOTICED AT THE C. B. R. P. PROGRAM IS NOT FUNDED IN OR AT LEAST THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS BEEN ARE SORT OF GO TO PRIVATE PROJECT TO GET PEOPLE- TO PURCHASE THIS IN WHY WOULD WE GET A BIGGER BANG FOR THE BOX IF WE JUST BOUGHT ELECTRIC VEHICLES. RATHER THAN A BILLION DOLLARS ON THE PROGRAMS AND AGAIN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ON THE EVE YOU CHARGING STATIONS CLEAN TRANSPORTATION MISLI YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT I SPENT MANY YEARS PRACTICING IN BANKRUPTCY COURT I KNOW THAT WE THE BUDGET INCLUDES A MORE TOWARD EXTENDING THE MORATORIUM ON EVICTIONS SO THE PEOPLE IN OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHY I'M LOOKING TO HELP THEM OUT IF THEY IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET AFFECTED AND THEY'RE GOING TO CAN'T PAY THEIR ELECTRIC BILL THEY'RE GETTING FOOD ASSISTANCE THAT WE HEAR ABOUT. HE CAN'T PAY THE THEIR WATER BILL AND THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB THERE ARE A PART OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT HOW WOULD THEY GO TO BUY A BRAND NEW CAR BUT- YOU KNOW ELECTION VIA. ON TOP THAT BUT WHY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE VERSUS- REBATES OR INCENTIVES TO BUY MORE. I EVN HYDROGEN CARS ARE ALL RESPONDED AT A HIGH LEVEL AND THEN HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES RESET GALLAGHER- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE UNDER MY NAME OR THE TEAMS AGAIN OF THIS BUDGET IS REALLY JOB CREATION AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- ONE BILLION AND SECURITIZATION OF FUTURE FEES AS A MEANS OF JOB CREATION AND ALSO- PROVIDING. CHARGING STATIONS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO- AROUND THE STATE TO HAVE- PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE- THIS OUT ABLE TO USE THEM AND SO THERE'S A NEED THAT I THINK ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE WERE ATTEMPTING TO- MEETS AND IN REGARDS TO THAT THE SECOND PART THAT'S THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED SIX SIXTY FIVE MILLION- TWO PLUS THE PROGRAM THAT YOU PROVIDE SUBSIDIES SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE INTO MORE EXPENSIVE- THAT. DOES YOUR MISSION- BUT YES I WILL HAVE IT OVER MORTGAGE. TO TREAT THE CALVERT. THANK YOU. I TREES ACCOUNTING AND ON YOUR CREDIT THERE IS A NO I. FUNDING PROVIDED FIRST YEAR P. AND THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN WOULD NOT THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO PROVIDE REBATES FOR PRISM SO- THERE'S ALSO THE CLEAN FUEL REWARDS FOR A PROGRAM AND THERE ARE SOME EXISTING. THE R. P. PROGRAM BUT WANTING TO KNOW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE- IS REALLY THERE TO. FOCUS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AS ADAM. ON SUCH A BIG SOURCE FOR EMISSIONS AND ALSO I'M GOING TO HAND IN HAND WITH THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS AND I NOTED THAT YOU PROVIDE REBATES FOR SENSE THAT DO EXIST. FOR FOLLOW UP HOUSE HELP WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR PRIORITIZING DEPLOYMENT YOU KNOW HOW IS THE PROGRAM GOING TO BALANCE THE INVESTMENTS THAT VOLKSWAGEN AND THE I. O. U.'S ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE. A INFRASTRUCTUREBEING BUILT HOW. HOW DOES FINANCE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TO DO THAT. I'M LEVEL AB- PROGRAM BECOME A ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND WE MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I DO HAVE- COLLEAGUES FROM THAT TRANSIT ARE FROM THE ENERGY AREA HERE I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT NOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER. OKAY MANAGER I HAVE FIVE I'M WITH THE FOR US MOTHER QUESTIONS AT OF BASICALLY IN SEPT TWO ONE. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THOUSAND OAKS SENATORS STERN SO. WITH THAT I'M DONE. THANK YOU SENATOR REID KALECKI SENATOR STERN YOU ARE UP IN THE SENATOR MEN FOLLOWS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY COMING THROUGH OKAY. YES OKAY- SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AS FAR AND ESPECIALLY THE- COMMENTS FROM ALL MY COLLEAGUES- OPENING LEVEL- JUST WANTED NOTE OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET SEVEN TWO ARENA WERE OMITTED. HAVE A COUPLE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- APPRECIATE THE INTENTION MY COLLEAGUES IN WHAT ON SCHOOL RE OPENING SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM LOS ANGELES ESPECIALLY I THINK SHOULD BE NOTED. COURAGE STUDIES SEE SOME MOVEMENT ON MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS I'M ESPECIALLY IN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND SOME OF THE CAL AIM INNOVATIONS THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT SO- SEVENTY TO DO MORE WORK THERE AS WELL AS IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- IN RESTORING SEVENTY AYE YES S. FUNDING- THAT IS SO SORELY NEEDED FOR. THOSE WHO ARE ALL ALONE GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND HEALTH- WITHIN THE BUDGET SENT TO ARENA THOUGH I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON WILDFIRE- AS WELL AS THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE QUESTION SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT. ON THE WILD FIRE FRONT- I WAS GOING THROUGH THE DC PD HERE AND TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. EXACTLY WHERE- BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED FOR THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE STRATEGY IS HEADED. AND YOU KNOW MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE FUNDING. I KNOW FIRE SAFE COUNCILS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A DIVERSE RANGE MEMBERS HERE BUT ACTUALLY JOHNSON YOURS FOR JUST ONE ELEMENT THAT IS. IMMUNITY ARMY A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SAY WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND SIMPLY- LARGE SCALE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT IN 10% THE KIND OF WORK THAT HAPPENS AROUND COMMUNITIES LIKE JUST EXPERIENCE THE ELDORADO FIRE OR BLUE RIDGE- OR THE VALLEY FIRE IN SAN DIEGO- WITH BOBCAT FIRED L. A. COUNTY HISTORICALLY. THESE COUNTIES AND THESE PROJECTS HAVE RECEIVED IT- SHORT SHRIFT. AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY DIFFERENT. 4% I THINK OF THE TOTAL BILLION IS. WHEN YOU TOWARDS COMMUNITY HARDENING LOOKS LIKE ABOUT 96% TOWARDS A BROADER RANGE OF FORCE. AND FORESTRY HEALTH PROJECTS AND WHILE I EAT WHOLEHEARTEDLY ARE. SUPPORT SOME OF THESE XCELERATED FORESTRY HEALTH PROJECTS. YOU TALKING ABOUT. CAPITA BASIS NOT ON A PER ACRE BASIS BUT ON A PER CAPITA BASIS WILDFIRE FUNDING IS NOT BEING GOING TO LARGE POPULATIONS THAT. AND SO I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE SENSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT. WHAT THE STRATEGY IS HERE WHY SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT FOR COMMUNITY HARDENING AND WHY. WHY NOT TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THE HISTORIC IMBALANCE THAT WE SEEN 93% OF ALL FUNDS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION OVER THE LAST FIVE OR FOUR YEARS SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. NINETY THREE PERCENT- I'M GOING TO BE SORT OF CHAMBER ORIENTED LARGER- NORTHERN PROJECTS FOR LACK OF A BETTER PROXY NOT JUST NORTHWEST TENDS TO BE. AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THE L. A. COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY SAN DIEGO COUNTY SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IMPERIAL COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY. RIVERSIDE COUNTY- YOU'VE RECEIVED ABOUT 3% OF THAT FUND. SO THERE'S A MISMATCH HERE WANT TO RAISE IT YOU'RE A QUICK REACTION I KNOW IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT MORE WORK. SO IS YOUR IS YOUR BOX. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO ALLISON- OR SOME A COLLEAGUE. A BI METALLIC THANK YOU. I SENATOR STERN THIS IS THE ALISON YOU IT DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M JUST BE QUESTION SO COUPLE OF THE FIRST IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY HARDENING WE THINK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS AND SUGGESTED SO THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR KIND OF A HOME IN TIP AND UNITY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHRE YOU FUNDS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO GOLD TWO STRUCTURES IN AND HURTING THEM AGAINST WILDFIRES. BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT OUR-FIRED THAT DAY FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET OF WHICH THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION SEE AN EARLY ACTION AFTER THE FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS IS ALSO A PART OF THAT COMMUNITY HARDENING BUCKET BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IF YOU BUILD A STRATEGIC FUEL BREAK WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE TURNED THE BUCKET YOU'RE ALSO HURTING THE COMMUNITY AGAINST WILDFIRE AND PREVENTING INCURSIONS ARE JUST TO SEE THAT WITHIN THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. I THINK WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COMMUNITY HARD ENOUGH IT MORE BROADLY THAN JUST THE ONE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUCKET THE OTHER THING I WOULD I WOULD FLAG IS THAT THERE IS SOME THINKING HERE ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT FUNDING IS APPLIED STATEWIDE- SO THAT WE ARE HITTING AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ALSO PRONE TO FIRE RISK AND IN ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE I WOULD SAY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION HAS THE REGIONAL FIRE AND FORCE CAPACITY PROGRAM. AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN SOME OF THE TARGET A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BUILDING REGIONAL. CAPACITY IN THOSE AREAS. RESTAURANT I KNOW THAT THE- THAT REGIONAL. ITSELF. SOME OF THE NEW IDEA ONCE YOU READY TO ALL THE COUNTY I NAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ABOUT TWO TWO MILLION. WHO HAVE GOT ABOUT YEARS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME RECTIFICATIONS HERE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL ON THAT- I THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE. LASTLY I KNOW WE- HAD A LONG HEARING HERE BUT ONLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- PROPOSAL- D. W. R. CAL FIRE PARKS ARE TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT THEIR- I THINK WHAT BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET- JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF- WHAT WHY THIS AMOUNT IN THE ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSAL- AND- WHAT. IS BEST IN LIGHT OF THE INDUSTRY OPERATING DEFICITS GOING FORWARD IN THE COMING YEARS ISN'T IS A GOOD YEAR TO. BE TAKEN CARE OF. MORE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I THINK- AND THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BALK AT AS IT WERE- IS ATTEMPTING TO- DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT. THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR- OUR STATE- PROPERTIES AND IN REGARDS TO THE AMOUNT- I THINK THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND DOLLARS- I'M I'M HIGHER DAYS INCLUDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THAT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE IT ENDED UP BUT- I WILL I WILL I HANDED OVER TO. MY COLLEAGUE FOR MORE SPECIFIC- THE HEALTH. HI TERRY SAID HOWARD WITH FINANCE AGAIN. DETAIL OTHER THAN TO NOTE THAT IT IS A BALANCE OF- FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THESE PURPOSES AND ALSO BALANCING WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THOSE THOSE ENTITIES YOU MENTIONED- FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH ALSO HAS ENTITIES OUTSIDE OF THAT THE RESOURCES. AREA AS WELL. YOU GUYS ARE THERE ANY PLANNED THOUGH FOR THE- I GUESS SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS OF. I'M STANDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE EVEN IF WE SIGN THIS FOR THE OUT YEARS IS THEIR LONG TERM THINKING ON THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FEES. THE PROPOSAL BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW THAT AND AS YOU NOTED THERE ARE A LOT OF DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE NEEDS FOR STATE PROPERTIES. OKAY THANKS FOR FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU THERE AND DINNER DEEPER AND ALL THIS. MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN NOW SENATOR MEN. I COME IN CLEAR. YES YOU ARE A FANTASTIC FIRST I JUST WANTED TO SAY- I APPRECIATE THE BRIEFING AND- THIS IS MY FIRST BUT IT HEARING- THERE'S A SAYING FROM THE GREEKS THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO ME A CIVILIZATION'S GREAT WHEN ITS ELDERS PLANT TREES WHOSE SHADE THEY KNOW THE NUMBER SAID IN AN I AIN'T LOOKING CLOSELY THIS BUDGET IT SEEMS TO REFLECT THAT GENERAL LONG TERM IS TO APPROACH- THAT THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT- WHILE ALSO CONVEYING A STRONG EMPATHY IS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED- I WANTED TO TURN BACK TO. THE TOPIC OF EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS- NINETY TWO QUESTIONS ONE RELATED TO THE K. TO TWELVE PIECE AND ANOTHER RELATED TO HIRE ADD ON THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SIDE. FOR UP ON- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR LAYERS COMMENTS- I'M A DAD TO PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS I'VE GOT A THIRD ONE THAT'LL DURING KINDERGARTEN NEXT FALL. HI THIS IS OBVIOUSLY PERSONAL TO ME. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MAYBE THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH AND I JUST WANTED TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT. THERE I'VE GOT SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT THAT TELL ME THEY'RE READY TO GO RIGHT NOW TO RE OPEN AND DO IN PERSON LEARNING THEY DON'T NEED MUCH AND AS WELL AS FAR AS RESOURCES. I'VE GOT SCHOOLS THAT TELL ME THAT THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AMOUNT I NOT GONNA BE NEARLY ENOUGH FOR THEM. I EASIEST TOO MUCH OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IN I GUESS I'D BE INTEREST IN PRACTICE IS SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO US. THROUGH THE BUDGET SUB ONE CAN MEET SUBCOMMITTEE- BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT FIGURE IN THAT PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER RELATED QUESTION IS DOES THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. MAYBE PROVIDE THE WRONG INCENTIVES TO TRY TO RE OPENED EARLY RATHER THAN SAFELY- YOU KNOW YOU GET THIS POT OF MONEY FOR OPENING ON ON DEMAND AND- YES I THINK CENTER LAYERED COMMENTED QUITE ELOQUENTLY ON. SO THE PROBLEM WITH THE DEADLINES BUT BUT DOES THIS KIND OF THING I THINK AS FAR AS- INCENTIVES AND WE'RE- CREATING AN- INCENTIVE HERE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN. QUICKLY BUT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY SAFELY AND IS THERE SOME FLEXIBILITY OUR WAY TO. TAILOR THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE BASED ON- THE DISTRICTS AND SO- I GUESS THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND THEN- PERHAPS ALL. ALL AS MY SECOND QUESTION A MOMENT. THANK YOU THAT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT I WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT ON THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED AND IT IS FRESH HOW COMPANIES LAST WEEK AND- IF WE CAN'T BRING STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BACK. SAFELY TO SCHOOL THEN WE SHOULDN'T BRING THEM BACK SAFELY WE CAN BRING THEM BACK TO SCHOOL AND SO THAT THE DOLLARS THAT ARE PROVIDED A REALLY TO- GIVE IT. TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOLS IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY THINK THEY NEED TO DO SO WHETHER IT'S P. P. AGAINST. BUT OTHER RESOURCES- IT'S TESTING OR CONTACT TRACING- WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TO THE SCHOOL SO ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. AND OTHER VIOLATIONS NOT BE GOING INTO AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT AND SO I JUST WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THAT UNDERSCORED- AND I THINK THAT THE PLANT WAS- INFORMED BY COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH AND CONTINUES TO BE INFORMED WITH THAT COMMUNICATION. WITH THE HOPE AND UNDERSTANDING THAT- LOCAL- LIAISE WILL DISTRICTS WILL DO WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR STUDENTS- AND THAT THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY REALLY DOES NEED TO BE THERE IT ISN'T A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE WE HAVE MILLIONS OF. KIDS ACROSS THOUSANDS- SCHOOLS- THAT NEED TO BE. THERE NEEDS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO JUST WANT TO. SAY THAT- YOU KNOW THE PLAN WAS NOT CREATED IN A VACUUM AND HAS BEEN INFORMED AND CONTINUES TO BE INFORMED. THROUGH ENGAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I GUESS IS AVAILABLE ARE ARE THERE GONNA BE KIND OF MEASURE BURKE SAVED BY ARE CAN. DOES YOUR THAT. ARE EACH OF THE ELEAZAR AIDS ACTUALLY BY DOCKING BEST PRACTICES. YES I'LL HAVE TO GET TO A HIGH LEVEL ON THAT AND THEN- MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES MAY HAVE THE DETAILS BUT ABSOLUTELY THAT THE IDEAS TO REALLY PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND IN WHAT. SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO THAT PARENTS AND OTHERS CAN FEEL THAT THEY CAN TRUST WHAT'S HAPPENING- IN IN REGARDS TO METRICS I'M GONNA TURN THAT OVER TO- MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOME. YES THANK YOU AND JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AND THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY HERE IN AND- AT PRESS OFFICE JUST RELEASED- THE NEW SCHOOL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. UNDERCOVER NINETEEN TO THAT BUT NEAR THE GET THE GUIDANCE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED ANTI ENCOURAGE FOLKS TAKE A LOOK THERE BECAUSE I THINK. THAT REALLY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF THIS PROPOSAL IS- BE A BUILDING OFF OF THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE USING THE MOST RECENT SCIENCE AVAILABLE- TO SET. AT TO PUT AND SOME GUIDELINES TO HELP SCHOOLS REOPEN SAFELY THEY JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT- IN ADDITION. IN ADDITION TO THE NEW GUIDANCE- WE ARE. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS WORKING WITH LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES. TO SET UP A- AT BASICALLY FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM HOTLINE NUMBER. AND UP PROCESS AN ONLINE PROCESS FOR PARENTS. STAFF TO MAKE. IT TO FLAG ISSUES THAT THEY THINK AND COLDER HAVING WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY- BETTER HAPPENING IN REAL TIME SO THAT THEY CAN APPLY THOSE FOR THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS IN THIS ISSUE CAN BE INVESTIGATED THAT THE REALLY ANOTHER REALLY. AND THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M SURE WE CAN FOLLOW UP LATER- BUT I JUST WANT TO ONE OF MY SECOND QUESTION- SO AS I'M LIKE. A MONTH AND A HALF% AGO I WAS FACULTY AT UC IRVINE I NOW HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING AT UNIVERSITY IN MY DISTRICT. I AND SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HIGHER ED- YEAH I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A WAS ON TOP OF A TEN PERCENT. CUT FROM THE PREVIOUS BUDGET CYCLE- INSTILLING BACK I THINK THE BIG HAVE EIGHT SIGNIFICANT. CUT FROM. THE PRE COALBED BUDGET. I AND I KNOW FROM PERSONAL OBSERVATION THAT THAT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE PUBLIC AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. HI THERE LOSING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE STREAMS- THEY'RE HAVING TO ADAPT TO NEW CHALLENGES- AND SO WHILE I'M PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PLAN ANY TUITION INCREASES. I GUESS I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING ENOUGH OR OUR OUR FINAL AGAINST HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HERE. I IS THE PLAN TO DO SOMETHING GOING FORWARD ARE SORTED IS THIS JUST KIND OF. WILL WE RESTORE THOSE THE. LONG TERM A PLAN HERE. OUR YEAH WE HAVE THAT BEEN- GETTING BACK. AS AS I WOULD JUST THAT- THE PLAN WAS NOT NECESSARILY TO- RESTORE CUTS BUT TO REALLY HELP OR WE COULD AN OBVIOUSLY THREE PERCENT- BASED INCREASE. ALONG WITH- SEVERAL MORE I'M GOING AND ONE TIME COSTS WILL HELP SUPPORT THE MISSION OF ALL THE SYSTEMS. THAT ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS. ADDITIONAL GENERAL- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING IN- WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TWO POINT NINE BILLION FOR THE UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMING INTO THIS MOST RECENT STIMULUS. PACKAGE AND THERE IS ALSO BILLIONS IN PRIOR PACKAGES AS WELL AND SO I THINK IN IN IN. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT AGAIN THROUGH THIS BREEDING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES TO PROVIDE THE SPORTS OR WE CAN TO OUR HIGHER. EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN- DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PARTICULARLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- THE STUDENTS. THERE AND SO- THE FEDERAL FINES I THINK WE'LL DO- A LOT TO HELP AND THEY HAVE AS WELL IN THE PAST PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID- WHICH ARE BUDGET ADDRESSES AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER. I GUESS JUST TO BE CLEAR I'M DONE MANAGER. THE ACTING CHAIR WILL RECOGNIZE MISS EGGMAN PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER ACTING CHAIR- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES OF- OF NOT KNOWING HOW TO. RAISE YOUR HAND ON THE OF THE S. COMPUTER IS THAT YOU GO TOWARDS THE END AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN ASKED SO. OF COURSE WOULD LIKE TO LINE SO MY COMMENTS WITH THE- CENTER LAYERED AROUND EDUCATION I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM MY DISTRICT SAID. IT'S UNREASONABLE TIME LINE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO MEET AND THEY'D LIKE MORE JUST TO PAY DOWN DEFERRALS- ILAM SOME MY COMMENTS WITH ISSUES AROUND EDT. AND THE FRUSTRATION FROM CALIFORNIANS- AND THEN IT TOO MIGHT. YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE BETWEEN DOING THINGS TO THE BUDGET THAT ARE POLICY OR THAN TRYING TO DO POLICY THAT REQUIRES FUNDING- SO I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU PUT IN FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT I THINK IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ISSUE THAT- IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF CALIFORNIA'S MIND BESIDES EDM AND THE ECONOMY CO IT IS THAT THE ISSUES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS AND HOW THOSE. HOW THOSE INTERSECT SO- I KNOW MYSELF AND A LOT OF MY PEERS REALLY WANNA WORK ON THAT THIS YEAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SO. IF YOU NEED IDEAS PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO REACH OUT- AND I THINK WE SEE IT WITH THE CHRONIC AND PERSISTENT POPULATION BUT THEN I WOULD OFFER THERE IS NOT ONE OF US. ATTENDING THIS. BUDGET HEARING RIGHT NOW WHO HAS NOT FELT AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND I'M EASE- UNKNOWN. AND SO YOU KNOW YOU PUT THAT ON TOP OF THAT BEING HOMELESS OR- LIVING IN AN ABUSIVE SITUATION AND WE JUST KNOW THAT JUST FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION. ISSUES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW SO AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO INTO THE SCHOOLS- IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT- AND THEN I GUESS JUST. JUST TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE KIND OF THE MIRACLE QUESTION IF WE DEAL. WITH STARKEY- SO. SOME OF THE EARLIER PREDICTIONS WERE I THINK TWENTY SIX BILLION FOR- THE WINDFALL AND NOW IT'S STANDARD FIFTEEN. HOW CONFIDENT ARE WE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GET EVEN FURTHER BY THE TIME THE MAY REVISE COMES AND THEN HOW WE MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT. BUT I GUESS MY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT QUESTION IS THE IDEA OF- IF WE GET A HUGE INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS- WHERE THEN WOULD WE TAKE THE GENERAL FUND MONEY AND INFUSE IT BACK IN TO THE BUDGET WRITES A LETTER THAT SAYS KIND AMERICAN QUESTION MY IF YOU pMIGHT BE GETTING SOME MORE. WHERE MOST FOCUSED DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD YOU WOULD INVEST. I WOULD LIE IF I WON THE LOTTERY KIND OF QUESTION- IT WAS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS WERE NOT COUNTING ON RIGHT NOW WHAT WILL WE DO WITH OUR MONEY- I LOVE THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT GENERALLY IF. WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES GIVE US MONEY WE DO LOOK FOR PLACES IF IT'S IF IT'S- POSSIBLE. TO BACK FILL FOR THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE CAN USE THOSE PRECIOUS DOLLARS ON ANOTHER- STATE PRIORITIES. OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING GET WHENEVER. THE BILL AND THAT INCLUDES FOR THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND- OUR ARTICLE IN RESPONSE AND TRYING TO. GET BACK FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS FOR A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SPENDING- STATE MONEY FOR UP FRONT- AND I GUESS YOUR QUESTION REALLY IS- IS YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE DO ALL OF OUR PRIORITIES LIE AND I WOULD SAY AGAIN THIS IS- A GIVE AND TAKE. AND DEFINITELY MUCH MORE CONVERSATION WILL OCCUR IN THE SPRING- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT- OUR OUR ECONOMICS- UNIT- HAS COME OUT WITH- ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND FROM DECEMBER ABOVE THE FORECASTED IN OUR CURRENT- THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. IN REVENUES FROM DECEMBER AGAIN ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE FORECASTED BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY IT'S VERY TENUOUS TO EXPECT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR EVERY MONTH UNTIL FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR AND SO WE WILL WE WILL. BE BACK AGAIN AND THE REVISION WITH FINAL REVENUES AND- EXPENDITURES AND HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE- OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE DO HAVE THAT- YOU KNOW IT ADDITIONAL WINDFALL ABOUT THE- THE FIFTEEN HOUR OR WHEN FALL SURPLUS EXTRA MONEY WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT ABOVE. WHAT WE CURRENTLY. HAVE IN THE BUDGET AT FIFTEEN BILLION. AND THEN JUST A ONE FINAL. AND YOU ALL FOR ALL YOU WERE IN. THIS OVER SO AND A LOOK FORWARD TO. SPEAKING IN THE- SO HEARINGS BUT I WAS VERY OF THE GOVERNOR'S ALL THE SIXTY FIVE YEAR COULD HAVE A VACCINE NOW BUT- THAT YOU KNOW IT'S CREATED A BUNCH OF LOGISTICAL ISSUES I THINK. A LOT OF OUR- COUNTY LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS WHO ARE ALREADY. OVERWHELMED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND DEALING WITH. NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS EXPECTING OUT- THE VACCINE SO I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA. REALLY PUSH THOSE VACCINES OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT WHAT WE KEEPING OUR WORD AND NOT. A FURTHER DISAPPOINTING THE PUBLIC THANK. SURE AND I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT IS WITH THIS IS NOT DONE BEFORE AND THAT THAT IS MY MISTAKE IS THAT WE DO HAVE DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE- BASICALLY ESTIMATED TOWARDS VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE STATE AND LOCALS AND IN REGARDS TO JUST THAT PROCESS YOU MENTIONED- ABOUT- PART OF IT IS COMMUNICATION AND PART OF IT IS IT JUST TAKES A PART OF IT IS. JUST ABOUT THE PROCESS OF- WORKING DID HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM- AND WITH COUNTIES AND SO- THE MONEY IS THERE FOR- A SUCCESSFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE SO THAT WE CAN GET. AS MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN WORDS THAT YOU'RE DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OR WAS IT THANK YOU OKAY GREAT NKS WILL NOW GO TO SENATOR NEWMAN. PATIENT SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO- TO THE FINANCIAL SIDE MEYER YOUR STAMINA AND YOUR GOOD NATURE TODAY. REAL QUICK QUESTION AND IF I MISS IT I APOLOGIZE IN THE- BUDGET OVERVIEW WHICH SEEMS LIKE DAYS AGO. THERE WASN'T MUCH AS I RECALL REGARDING CHILD CARE AND CHILD CARE FUNDING AND PLANNING FOR. A CHILD CARE FUNDING AS YOU KNOW- CHILD CARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE BOTH PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZING PRIVATE HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE RECESSION- IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A QUICK OVERVIEW ON PLANS AND THINKING. AS IT RELATES TO FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ARE EXPECTING A BILLION DOLLARS TO COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS LAST STIMULUS PACKAGE SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILD CARE- AND OBVIOUSLY- PLANS AND DISCUSSIONS. FOR THE DISCUSSIONS MAJOR KERR IN REGARDS TO DON AND- POTENTIALLY MORE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING- BUT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO JESSICA HOMES TO GIVE YOU. A SENSE OF MORE THE DETAIL AND WHAT WE'RE INVESTING IN FOR CHILD CARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES- AN ONGOING ALLOCATION OF FORTY FOUR MILLION CANNABIS AND TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE. AS WELL AS FIFTY FIVE MILLION A FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- FOR COULD RESPOND- FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MISLEAD AT MICHELINE MENTIONED- WE ARE ANTICIPATING AN ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO- INCORPORATE INTO THE BUDGET HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT. SB EIGHT TWENTY FROM LAST SESSION AND IT'S NOT A POSITIVE TRIGGER FOR CHILD CARE FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE. PROVIDED AND- THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ALLOCATE IT TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION OF THOSE FUNDS FOR THINGS LIKE- ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS FOR PROVIDERS WHO WERE FORCED TO CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- EXTENDING CARE FOR SPECIAL WORKERS- AND THAT AS WELL AS RE OPENING COST YOUR PROVIDERS AND SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO. AMBER CERTAINLY AWAITING TO BE AWARDED BEST PLAN. THAT WE CAN GET THEM OUT VERY QUICKLY WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION IN ORDER TO GET THOSE OUT QUICKLY- BUT THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL- SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO. APPROXIMATELY TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF- FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN THIS SPACE AND SO WE- HAVE STARTED TO REACH OUT TO AND YOUR STAFF AND STAFF INTO THE COMMITTEES THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- ON WHAT. WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO GET BEACH THESE FUNDS ALLOCATED AND. WHAT THE PRIORITIES TO BE FOR THEM. SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT A LOT FOR CONTINUE KIND OF. THANK SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE COURT. I HAVEN'T- ADDING IN TO WHAT ELSE QUESTION BUT IT DID OCCUR TO ME THAT. CLEARLY WHEN I REFERENCED IN THE OPENING OF THE HEARING THAT THE LATEST DATA IN DECEMBER FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT. THE JOB LOSS THE MOST RECENT JOB LOSS WAS ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF FELT AMONG WOMEN THAT A GOOD DEAL OF THAT WAS CHILD CARE WORKERS NOT ALL OBVIOUSLY AND THAT IN GENERAL ARE CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE PRETTY LOW WAGE WORKERS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT HOW WE KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS. INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN POVERTY THAT CERTAINLY AN ASPECT BUT IT DIRECTIONALLY WE WILL- WE ARE I THINK ALL OF US AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OBVIOUSLY ALSO- WE ARE. TRYING TO- NOT TRYING WE ARE ORIENTING A BUDGET TOWARDS- A CALIFORNIA THAT IS BACK TO FUNCTIONING AND ECONOMICALLY ROBUST. AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT ONCE. DID VIRUSES UNDER CONTROL AND PEOPLE ARE BACK AT WORK CHILD CARE WILL BE ESSENTIAL SO OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING THAT QUESTION. AND NOW WE WILL GO TO. SENATOR CAFIERO AND THEN FOLLOWED THAT DOCTOR PAN SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE RURAL CALIFORNIA SHUT DOWN MIKE FOR SENATOR CAFIERO. SALAS HAPPENS TO RURAL ROUTE RULE RESIDENCIA SHUT OFF THE MIKE HOPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW THAT THIS- CORONA VIRUSES REALLY- IT. PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE FAIL TO ADDRESS- WHETHER IT'S BROADBAND OVER HOW TO CURB OVER CROWDED HOUSING. OR THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR OUR POOREST RESIDENTS- DOES. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY EVENT DETRIMENTALLY AFFECTED AND- YOU KNOW ON THE BROADBAND ISSUE THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS SITTING IN FRONT TO TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE THERE WAS INTERNET ACCESS THERE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR SCHOOL- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT WAS IN MY COMMUNITY IN MY DISTRICT- AND THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL- SO I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE VERY. DELIBERATE ABOUT HOW WE TAKE IT THE REVENUE THAT WE HAVE NOW AND HOW WE INVESTED IN- IN OUR RESIDENTS SO THAT WE CAN GET THE BEST OUTCOME POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO WORK AS DILIGENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE CAN AND THEN COME UP. TO GET TOGETHER- AND TO HELP TO STARTED DRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE NEED TO- ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND WE'RE FACING THIS PANDEMIC A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AS WELL- N. AS A AS A FOOTNOTE- THIS IS REALLY BEEN A- A TOUGH YEAR. AND THE TOUGH YEAR HAS FALLING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE POOREST MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE ONE SHINING LIGHT IS THE VACCINE. AND SO- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB BECAUSE AS I HAVE CALLED AROUND TO FIND OUT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE VACCINE- THERE IS CONFUSION. AND THERE'S DISAGREEMENT OVER HOW THE TIERED SYSTEM WORKS AND WOOD AND THAT IS THE ONE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT GOVERNMENT CAN FUNCTION WELL IN THAT WERE WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS ONE RIGHT SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT. WHO SHOULD BE RECEIVING THE VACCINE RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO MOVE WITH ALL DUE DELIBERATE SPEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET INTO PEOPLE'S ARMS SO I JUST SAY I'VE GOT I SOME QUESTION ABOUT. BUT BUDGET SUB FOR I WON'T. BELABOR A LOT OF IT BUT IF YOU COULD TELL US- THAT THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE- SMALL BIT BUSINESS GRANT. A PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR. ROLLED OUT. USING THIS YEAR'S- I'M RESOURCES AND THEN HE'S HE ADDS FIVE HUNDRED AND 500-005-0065 THOUSAND. MILLION I'M SORRY DOLLARS EXTRA- THE APPLICATION. EACH CLOSE EITHER YESTERDAY OR TODAY AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL US HOW MANY. OF THIS THESE ARE THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS HOW MANY APPLICATIONS GO BIZ HAS RECEIVED SO FAR BOTH IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF APPLICATIONS AND- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY REQUESTED AND- IF YOU COULD ALSO ELABORATE ON HOW GRANT GRANTEES WILL BE SELECTED. YES I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE WENT HOME TO ANSWER SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON- SO THE GRANT PROGRAM DID CLOSE LAST NIGHT- IT BUT AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC FIGURES TO PROVIDE YOU ON THE PRECISE NUMBER OF ALLOCATIONS. AS OF YESTERDAY IT WAS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS- THERE COULD BE SOME DUPLICATION IN THERE BUT I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THAT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE- WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON THE AMOUNTS REQUEST AT THIS POINT SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THAT TO YOU- THIS SOON AS IT'S AVAILABLE THE NEXT. DAY OR TWO- AS IT RELATES TO THE SCORING CRITERIA. IT'S GOING TO BE ON THREE PRINCIPAL AREAS- GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION BASED ON THE CODE NINETEEN HEALTH AND SAFETY RESTRICTIONS- ACROSS THE STATE. THAT BENEFITS THE INDUSTRIES MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN IT'S LOOKING OUT UNDER CENTER SEARCH SMALL BUSINESS GROUPS- ACROSS THE STATE SO THAT MIGHT BE. MAJORITY OWNED OR AROUND THE DAILY BASIS BY WOMEN MINORITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR VETERANS BUSINESSES LOCATED IN THE LOW. TO MODERATE INCOME IN RURAL AREAS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I EXPECT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AYE AYE. THE PURPOSE OF THAT OBVIOUSLY IS TO FIX IT IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE RIGHT SIZE- WHETHER WE NEED TO ADD MORE MONEY TO PRODUCE. TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM OR NOT. MOVING ON TO THE CAPTAIN PIZZA GRANT PROGRAM THIS THIS IS- ANTICIPATED BE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD HELP BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO EXPAND. AND CAN YOU DEFINE OR ELABORATE WHAT QUALIFIES AS A HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREA- AND THEN MY SECOND CONCERN IS- IF IN FACT. COMPANIES COULD. OBTAIN A GRANT. AND HOW THAT HAVE NO OR LITTLE TAX LIABILITY IN THE STATE WHAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM. RECEIVING A GRANT AND THEN TURNING AROUND AND LEAVING THE STATE IN THE YEAR TWO. HI THIS IS GOING TO COME AGAIN- AS IT RELATES TO THE DEFINITION AND WE'RE STILL SORT OF WORKING THROUGH HOW I'M HOW PRECISELY DEFINED THAT WERE ACTUALLY SORT OF HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR YOU- THE GUIDELINE PROCESS IN KALKAJI. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT- LOOKING AT REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT- YOU COULD USE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND SORT OF EVEN PRIOR TO COVER NINETEEN AND- RECOVERY FROM THE- GREAT RECESSION AND THOSE AREAS WHERE WHERE WHERE THE- RECOVERY DIDN'T YOU KNOW MEET OUR ORDER WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE STATE SO AND THEN THERE'S NUANCE AND THEIR ANSWER SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS IS AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT EVEN IF IT'S IN AN INDUSTRIAL AREA NEAR LOW INCOME AREA THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT SOMETHING IN BECAUSE FOLKS IN THOSE AREAS CAN'T GO TO WORK- JUST ACROSS THE STREET SO THERE'S CHALLENGES WITH GETTING TO SPUR SCRIPTED AMMAN SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT OUT A DEFINITION TO SERVE THE INTENDED PURPOSE WITHOUT BEING OVERLY LIMITED- BY A STATUTE IN THE FUTURE- AND THEN- AB. FORGETTING YOUR OTHER QUESTION- I'M SORRY IT WAS THAT HAD TO DO WITH- THE FACT. THAT IF WE IN FACT. GRANT ACCOMPANIED DOESN'T PAY. IN THE STATE OF A GRAY TO COME THAT DOESN'T PAY TAXES IN THE STATE- WHAT WOULD KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING THE STATE NEAR TO ONCE THEY TAKE THE GRANT. USE IT AND THEN LEAVE. YEAH SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT- RECAPTURE OR COLLECTION OPTIONS THAT CURRENT CAL COMPETES PROGRAM. DOES HAVE A RECAPTURE IF THEY DON'T NEED THAT- CRITERIA AS LAID OUT IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATE MORE BUSINESS. SO WHERE- LOOKING AT IT YOU KNOW. THE BEST WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE MET- THAT BUSINESS DOESN'T NEED- AGREED UPON- PLAN. VERY GOOD SO THAT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HIGH NEED IN HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS I WOULD I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE WORK DILIGENTLY TOGETHER I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT WOULD ROLL OUT AND WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES COULD BENEFIT AND WHAT KIND OF JOBS ARE BEING CREATED IN IN IN THOSE BUSINESSES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR ANSWER. AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE- KELLY ITC. THIS PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE IT HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE LIVES OF FOUR PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING AND SO- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. RETURNING TO CALLIE ITC IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET CHECKS OUT TO THE MOST. THE PEOPLE THAT OUR NEEDIEST IN OUR COMMUNITY. ARE THERE ANY- ANY RESTRICTIONS ON KALECKI ITC ELIGIBILITY OR TRENDS IN CLAIMING CAL EITC LET ME TELL YOU THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT. ON THE PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH WITH THE EITC PROGRAM IS THE UPTAKE. D. INFORMATION OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FILE A TAX RETURN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET A CHECK- LAST YEAR- A BILL WAS PASSED THAT ASKED EVERY FIFTEEN BE TO WORK WITH THAT- AND VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THAT COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT FIVE CALIFORNIANS. INCOME TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM A CHECK AUTOMATICALLY SO I GUESS I'M I'M ASKING IN THIS QUESTION WHETHER ONLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FILED UP TO THIS POINT- THEIR THEIR TAXES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT WE CAN GO BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THE MOST. THE MOST NEEDY MAY BE THE ONES THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR IT. YES I LET ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN A COUPLE WAYS ONE IS THAT YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE HAD- FUNDING IN THE LAST FEW BUDGETS FOR EITC OUR REACH- BROUGH AT TV AND SO THERE'S BEEN WAYS. THERE BEEN THERE'S BEEN FUNDING TO ATTEMPT TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE AND YOU SAY- AND THEN SECONDLY. BE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS WAS PROPOSED- AGAIN PRIOR TO KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOT KNOWING IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN SAID THE GOAL AND THE TARGET AUDIENCE. WITH TOO THAT THE GOAL IS TO GET THE MONEY OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE KNOWING THAT A LOT OF- DEADLINES- A LOT OF PROGRAM BENEFITS WERE ENDING AT THE END OF. THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR AND SO- THE A. T. THE PROPOSAL IS TO- PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED ONE TIME TO TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA E. I. T. C. PILOT- RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS- TWENTY TWENTY YEAH T. C. I. TEN FIVE HOURS- THE FIRST WAS. IS THE LARGER GROUP THERE'S PROBABLY CLOSE TO. I WANT TO SAY- THREE POINT. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT GROUP AND- THE IDEA IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THOSE FOLKS ON FILE WE CAN GET THE MONEY OUT TO THEM QUICKLY- I THOUGHT THAT WAS. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE AGAIN- THIS IS- THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT THE START OF CONVERSATIONS AND WE HAVE HEARD MANY OTHERS ASK WHETHER OR NOT THAT. THAT POPULATION. CAN BE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT SOMEWHAT. THANKS FOR THAT I. THAT WE'RE TURN TO DO THE IS COOK AS- AND ARE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME VERY VERY QUICKLY. AND THEN IN REACH IN REGARDS TO THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM- I JUST. I WANT TO PUT A POINT IN THIS AND THEN ALSO ABOUT THE HOMELESS FUNDS- THIS IS A PROPOSAL. THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND OUR OUR HOUSING NEEDS AND THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY AND THIS. INTERFERE THE INFIELD MONEY TENDS TO BE OVERSUBSCRIBED USUALLY- BY. MULTIPLE MEMBERS SO- THE QUESTION I HAVE IN REGARDS TO THIS IS WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES IT'D MINISTRATION HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH BY THIS PARTICULAR- GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE SOMETHING QUICKLY I BELIEVE THIS IS A REAL ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. STRATEGY BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT RURAL CALIFORNIA I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF MY SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE INCREDIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT- THAT OUR- PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS- SEWERS AND WATER SYSTEMS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES YOU'RE- YOU'RE SEEKING TO LOOK AT. SURE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED PUTTING ADDITIONAL MONIES IN. THE IN INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM- GRANT PROGRAM OR ID. IT WAS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO LOCALS THAT WERE SHARING THEIR NEEDS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND BASICALLY SAYING YES WE WOULD LIKE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING BUT WE NEED. TO SET WE NEED TO BUILD A SEWER LINES WE NEED TO BUILD- WATER AND LIGHTING AND BASICALLY WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED HELP PAYING FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HENCE- THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION I THINK IT WAS THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR IJJI AND- WORKING FROM THAT AND UNDERSTANDING TO TWO THINGS AGAIN DON'T CREATION. AND GETTING. PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. ARAMBULA ONE OF THE GOAL OF. THIS PROPOSAL AND ANOTHER ONE IS OBVIOUSLY- ANOTHER PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND- A PARTY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BUILDING MORE OF IT SO. I'M TRYING TO HIT SOME LOCALS THERE- IN REGARDS TO- THE FINAL OUTCOME I THINK IT REALLY IS JUST AYE GETTING MORE UNITS UP- MORE OF. DEMAND CAN BE MET AND WE CAN START DRIVING DOWN THE PRICES OF HOUSING. THANK YOU AND THEN FINALLY I THIS IS NOT IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION JUST TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR INFORMATION LATER IS THAT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED. AND MANY IT FOR MANY YEARS HAS PUSHED UP MONEY FOR HOMELESS SERVICES INC AT HUPP MONEY FOR HOMELESS SERVICES IN A VERY FLEXIBLE M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; CAN BE USED FOR.&lt;/c&gt;</u> A VARIETY OF THINGS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME DATA ON. BEST PRACTICES HOW MANY HOMELESS HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN OFF THE STREETS AND WHERE. THAT HAS HAPPENED IS IT THE BIG CITIES IS IT RURAL COMMUNITIES IS IT ONE PARTICULAR AREA. WHAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THEN- HOWEVER THIS YEAR SHE'S DOING BECAUSE I. I ASK LOCALLY FOR INFORMATION AND I HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME GETTING DATA FROM THEM AND- IT IT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO JUST KEEP- EVERY YEAR. ADDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOT SEEING THE RESULTS ON THE STREETS AND I KNOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE EVALUATIONS BASED ON. THE SITUATION AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT I JUST I WANNA BE BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I I'M VIGNETTES DON'T DON'T SELL IT WE NEED TO KNOW. IF WE HAD TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND TWO YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE A THOUSAND LAST THAT TELLS ME THAT WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- AND THAT IT YEAH AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE'S SOME BEST PRACTICES AS WELL THAT THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE USING AND WE SHOULD INCLUDED IN OUR LEGISLATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- YOUR- YOUR- YOUR- EXPLANATIONS TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THIS IS- PRETTY UNUSUAL TO BE DOING THIS THE FIRST WEEK THAT WE COME BACK IN INTO SESSION AND I DO APPRECIATE THE URGENCY THAT ON IN MOST OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE GET THEM DONE. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS SENATOR PER EURO AND DAD. SENATOR PAN RIGHT BEFORE WE GO DO YOU ARE JUST SOME GOING TO ALERT FOLKS THAT- UNLESS AND ANY OTHER SENATOR HAS THE DAY OF NECESSITY TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE WOULD BE QUEUING UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOLLOWING. DR PANTS QUESTIONS SO IN MY- AM I OKAY TO QUEUE UP THAT PUBLIC COMMENT SENATORS. OKAY SO- THE MIDDLE OUT DR PAN AND THEN- THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT BY PHONE YOU'LL SEE THE PHONE NUMBER ON THE- ON THE SCREEN. OKAY GO AHEAD DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I THINK- BOTH DEPARTMENTS FINANCE AND- DELEO- FOR THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT- MY GOOD FRIEND- FROM FREMONT- THAT- I'M NOT LOOKING TO CAP AND TRADE MONEY FOR DENTAL SERVICES BUT I DO HOPE THAT- WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT UP PROP FIFTY SIX. THIS FUNDING- AS VOTERS INTENDED TO IMPROVE ACCESS A MEDIC CAL AND I DO APPRECIATE- THE STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN A AND THEN IDEA SOME QUESTIONS- SO FIRST OF ALL- YOU KNOW. AND MAINLY FOCUS ON HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AND CERTAINLY SHARED MAIN CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER AREAS AND- AND EAGER TO HEAR DAY AND GET. THE ANSWERS THAT THEY RECEIVE- TO THEIR QUESTIONS- SO ON THE ONE TWENTY I JUST MAKE A NOTE IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET ESPECIALLY WE LOOK AT THE OUT YEAR PROJECTIONS- WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR MANY YEARS AS WE'VE BUILT IN. AUTOMATIC CUTS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I HSS TO DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND SO FORTH AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE SUSPEND THOSE CUTS. RIGHT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE BUILD WE BUILD IN AND OUT YEARS SEVEN PERCENT. ETCETERA CUTS TO A WIDE VARIETY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND I GUESS MY CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT YOU SUSPENDED IT FOR THIS COMING YEAR SO RELEVANT TO THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS. I'M NOT SURE IT'S NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE OR FAIR TO SAY THAT WELL ACTUALLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS NOT BUDGET ON THE IDEA THAT- YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER WE'RE GONNA DO A 7% CUT AUTOMATICALLY ACROSS THE YOU KNOW ON ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND- AS THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. DESPERATELY NEEDED AND- SO WE SUSPEND THESE CUTS YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT'S APPROPRIATE THING TO DO BUT I JUST I. JUST CAREFUL THE NOMENCLATURE THAT WE'RE SUSPENDING. THE CUTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS ONE WE DOES HAPPEN THOSE ARE TO BE CUT IN AND THEN SOMEONE'S GOT SAY WELL WE'LL NEED TO. SOME MORE. AND SO- AND AGAIN THIS IS PARTICULAR TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I JUST WANNA MENTION THAT THE OTHER THING I ALSO DO WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION AS WELL IS- ON THE MEDICAL FRONT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE- THE- WHAT WE'RE TRYING O DO WITH CAL AIM. WHICH IS WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY IS TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEIR SPECIFICS THAT- LOOK FOR TO DIGGING INTO ONE EARNED AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND- PERHAPS SOME CHANGES OR TWEAKS THAT WE MIGHT. HEAR FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE ABOUT IT. BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT PART OF THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF TIMING IS THAT NEAR THE WAIVERS FOR EXAMPLE WE GOT A WAIVER THAT WE GOT EXTENSION OR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER BUT THAT WILL. END THIS YEARS AGO WHEN YEAR EXTENSION. SO WE DO HAVE TO REPOSITION OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM ANYWAY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WAIVERS THAT WERE. LOOKING FOR AND GETTING AND SO I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE MA RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHY WE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON ON GOING ON MEDIC CAL BUT- I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THESE STEPS ARE REPOSITION MEDICAL PROGRAM TO HOPEFULLY ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE COST EFFICIENT GOING FORWARD. AND WE KNOW THAT AFTER CODE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AS WELL. AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A BETTER JOB OF. DOING THAT SO I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO DIGGING INTO. THAT MORE IN DEPTH AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE DEALING A PANDEMIC. AND CERTAINLY I THINK ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES IS FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CONTAIN THIS- THIS. COVERED VIRUS WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY. TAKEN TO MOBILIZE A TO MAKE CALIFORNIANS IS DEVASTATED. FAMILIES OUR ECONOMY. HIS ABILITY GO TO SCHOOL PEOPLE GAME BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK BUSINESSES BEING OPEN- AND I'VE I RECOGNIZE THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN MONEY FROM THE FED ZIDAN YEAH THE FIRST TEARS ACT AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE'RE GONNA GET MORE MONEY. BUT AS WE ARE DOING OUR HEARINGS ALL RIGHT NOW HERE FINANCE SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE PLANNING THIS BUDGET WE DIDN'T. KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN THE SECOND STIMULUS WHICH BY THE WAY IS PASSED BY ABOUT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO- WE- I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY ACTUALLY WE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH BETWEEN BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE AND CERTAINLY HELP HIM SERVE AS WE ALLOW FEDERAL MATCHING MONEY AND STUFF BUT TAX. THINGS SO WE KNOW WHETHER WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND- TEN AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO FINANCE- AND I APPRECIATE AND ALSO L. A. L. SAID WELL. YOU KNOW WE DEVELOP THIS BUDGET AND YES YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN MAY REVISED BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME THINGS YOU WANNA MOVE OUT NOW. ARE CODED RESPONSE NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION YOU'LL BE SHARING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. ON THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED BOTH TO DATE AND WE ANTICIPATE. PARTICULARLY TO. IN MY MIND PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THAT'S THE TIP OF THE SPEAR BUT ALSO THE OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO. YOU KNOW I GET IT YOU'RE SAYING NOW OKAY WE DEVELOP THIS BUDGET THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUDGET CAN'T JUST BE CONSTRAINED ONLY TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND WHAT WE ARE SPEND STATE MONEY ON. WE HAVE TO KNOW. THE COLLECTIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE SOME OF IT OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR CERTAIN THINGS SO WE CAN'T REALLY CONTROL THAT BUT WE AT LEAST NEED TO KNOW WHAT. TOKEN CAN BOTH- FINANCE IN ELLO. SPEAK TO ARE YOU GOING TO BE WHEN YOU'RE AT A SUB COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND ALSO WE HAVE A BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS. THEN WE'LL HAVE A MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION AND ACTUALLY GIVE US THAT INFORMATION WE HAVE THOSE HEARING SO WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. ON RESOURCES. THANK YOU SENATOR AND COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT A FULL. A FULL PAGE HERE NOT JUST THE GENERAL FUND OR STATE FUNDS BUT ALSO FEDERAL FUNDS- AND NOT AND IN TERMS OF TIMING NOT USING ANYTHING AS AN EXCUSE- JUST WANTING TO SERVE. PUT OUT THERE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAD IN OUR BUDGET- BUT DEFINITELY NEED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT'S COMING DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD SAY GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT WE- IT'S COMING MORE AS A TRICKLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND- AND- BY. SORT OF PROGRAMMING PROGRAM IN REGARDS TO RAGS AND- STIPULATIONS AROUND HOW THESE DOLLARS SHOULD GO OUT- I DID PROVIDE FOR THE COMMITTEE- THE POTENTIAL ESTIMATES FOR CALIFORNIA WE- I'M NOT SURE IF. YOU'LL HAVE THAT THERE IS AN UPDATE TO THE TABLE THAT WE HAD- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY JUST CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO WE ALREADY HAVE UPDATED CHANGES IN PROBABLY THE TABLE THAT PROVIDED WILL CHANGE AGAIN- DEPENDING AND WHEN WE GETMORE. INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ABSOLUTELY AND- THE GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO KEEP PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO YOU AS WEAK AS AS IT'S RELEASED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO INFORM- HOW WE CAN AUGMENT OR USE THOSE DOLLARS- TO COMPLEMENT THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING ON THE GROUND AND IN REGARDS TO COOK NINETEEN RESPONSE BUT ALSO WHAT'S INCLUDED AND- THE BUDGET. FOR EITHER- EARLY ACTION OR AS PART OF THE NORMAL BUDGET PROCESS OKAY SO YOU'VE BECAUSE WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS WE GOT PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER SO WE CANCER LIKE THIS IS THE STATE PARK IN THE NURSES AND THAT WE'RE GONNA YELL AUGMENT WHERE SO WE NEED TO KNOW STRATEGICALLY WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE. AND ACTUALLY ELIA ON IF YOU HAD ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT IN TERMS OF YOUR ANALYSIS AS WE GET. THIS INFORMATION OUT HOW MUCH FEDERAL MONEY LIKE. IN TERMS OF OKAY THE TOTAL OF MONEY WE REALLY GOING TO COMMITTING THIS WOULD BE ACCESS. YES DOCTOR CAN'T IT'S A GOOD QUESTION- AND- CERTAINLY OUR STAFF WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THAT. THE FEDERAL PACKAGING B. YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THAT IN MORE DETAIL WITH YOU IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS. BUT WE ALSO DID WANT TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT WOULD. ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. ALLOCATE FEDERAL FUNDS AT THEIR DISCRETION AND SO I MEAN I THINK THIS IS ALL JUST TO SAY I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS. AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE I. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THOSE CHOICES SO- AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM THE L. A. WOULD WANT. TO SUPPLEMENT ANYTHING AT SAID ON THAT. OKAY SO- AND I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE I THINK TO SAY NOW APROPOS TO WHAT- I THINK CENTER CRAZY ASKED A LITTLE EARLIER- IT IS THE- THIS BRANCHES JOB TO APPROPRIATE- AND WILD WE DON'T TECHNICALLY APPROPRIATE. THE FEDERAL MONEY DIRECTLY- I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ADMINISTRATION VIEW US AS PARTNERS AND DEBT ALLOCATION THAT IT'S NOT LIKE- IT'S FEDERAL MONEY AND THEREFORE WE CAN ALLOCATE THAT WE WANT TO WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU KNOW AT. YOU'LL YOU'LL LET US KNOW I'M SURE WE'RE GOOD PARTNERS IN THAT SENSE BUT- I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE ENGAGED IN THOSE DECISIONS. RIGHT SO WE KNOW WE HAVE CERTAIN FEDERAL MONEY'S GOING AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW ALLOCATE. DEL APPROPRIATE STATE MONEY WE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO MAKE ON THE FEDERAL MONEY SO WE DO SO WE DON'T FIND OUT THAT- WE APPROPRIATE THE STATE MONEY AND NOW WE HAVE THIS MUCH GOING ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AND THEN THERE'S A HOLE SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT LANGUAGE REGARDING THAT AS WELL- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I KNOW EARLIER WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IS THAT TRAILER LYFT I DON'T I THINK THAT'S- RIGHT I THINK LAST YEAR WE SORT OF ACCEPTED IT BUT I HOPE THAT THIS YEAR WE REVISIT THAT AS WELL I THINK WE DO NEED MORE CONTROLS ON THE- ON THE- LEGISLATIVE SIDE. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT YES THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BUT THIS IS. AN ONGOING EMERGENCY YOU KNOW WE THIS IS THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND WE'RE STILL HAVING THIS EMERGENCY AND- FRANKLY THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF A SAY IN AN EMERGENCY THAT'S- ONGOING THIS LONG IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATIONS. LET ME JUST MENTION MAYBE TO USE MORE SPECIFIC THINGS I MAY DELVE INTO IT- SO FIRST OF ALL DID NOT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT VACCINATION I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR COMMITTING. THREE I THINK IT'S THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SOME MILLION FOR VACCINATION. AND IN ADDITION- I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE FUNDING FOR VACCINATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY JUST Y. CLARIFIED THAT THE AMOUNT THE GOVERNOR IS ANNOUNCED THAT FROM THE STATE. IS THAT SEPARATE FROM FROM. AN THEREFORE THE ADDITION. MONEY FROM THIS. CARE IS ACTIVE A D. TO AN TERM OF FOR. OR IS THAT THE SAME MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN ALSO WE'RE IS THAT THREE HUNDRED AND SOME. SEVENTY MONEY MILLION DOLLARS COMING FROM XANDER STAND THAT'S NOT NECESSARY FROM THE GENERAL FUND SO CAN- FINANCE PLEASE KILL IT CLARIFIED. THE COMMITMENT TO GETTING OUR VACCINES OUT- TO ME. IN TERMS OF YES- WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING- THE EFFORTS AND GETTING THE VACCINE OUT YES TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS- POSSIBLE AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO. THAT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION FIGURE THAT WAS QUOTED BY THE GOVERNOR- IS. IT AN ESTIMATE WITH AN ESTIMATE MADE AT THE TIME- THAT WE DEVELOP THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF WHAT WE ANTICIPATED HAVING TO SPEND OR NEEDING TO SPEND. IN REGARDS AFFECTING IT IS NOT- A PROPOSAL- AND THERE ISN'T. IF IT TAKES ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE- THAT THE COST ESTIMATE- AGAIN THE DEALERS RECALLED SYSTEM INTERROGATE FORTY SIX OF THE SUMMARY PAGES. THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND- THE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE. LOOKS FROM SORRY WHERE'S. THAT MONEY COMING FROM THE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION. SOURCE OF THE FUNDS YOU'RE NOT AGAIN THESE ARE NOT. THAT BASED ON A FUNDING THE ARE TO OKAY. PETER COSTS AT. AND SO- INTO MANY CASES MAY END UP HAVING TO PAY STATE MONEY UP FRONT BUT GET REIMBURSED THROUGH OTHER FUNDS LATER SO THAT'S JUST. JUST WHAT WE ANTICIPATED AGAIN NOT KNOWING WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GET FROM THE FEDS. THE FEDERAL DOLLARS- THE FAT I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL DOLLARS COMING DOWN- FOR VACCINATION. IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND- THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ACCORDING TO L. A. L. UNDER REPORT. WHILE WORKING ON- THAT WOULD BE ON TOP OF ANYTHING THAT THE STATE WOULD SPEND. AGAIN IT'S A BIT OF A COINCIDENCE THE NUMBERS ARE SIMILAR- BUT THAT IS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS SO THAT'S ADDITIONAL ON TOP OF THE THREE OKAY SO LOOKING FORWARD TO DELVING MORE SPECIFICALLY INTO THAT- AND I APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION. AND THEN I GUESS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE YOU KNOW OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- DAY ARE YEAH WE'VE BEEN UNDERFUNDING THEM FOR A LONG TIME I APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS WITH US LAST YEAR. A YEAR TWO YEARS AGO- THAT ACTUALLY DO IT WE ACTUALLY. EVEN ALLOCATED I THINK THOSE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- TO TRY TO HELP BOLSTER THEM UP BEFORE EVEN YOU CODE WAS COMING. I KNOW IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL AT LEAST- YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL- STATE MONEY FOR. COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS I KNOW OUR CDPH IS- IS. YEAH THEY'RE STRETCHED TO- SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WE'RE GIVING TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE BOTH DOING ALL OUR CONTACT TRACING TRAINS YOUR VACCINATIONS I MEAN I'M- USUALLY TALKING TO THEM WILL. MAKE IT TEN OR ELEVEN AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO BUSY- AND- SO. IS IT BECAUSE EXPECTING THE FEDS TO PAY FOR ALL OF THAT OKAY SO CAN WE CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. A WIDER HASN'T BEEN- AN ALLOCATION FOR. OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ARE AND OBVIOUSLY. TOTALLY AGREED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE DOING A LOT MORE COORDINATING WITH THEM ON. ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE RESPONSE INCLUDING VACINES- BUT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC- BUDGET- KIND. OF DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SOMEBODY IN OUR EIGHTY JUSTINA. OKAY EIGHTY NINE. HI DOCTOR PAN RYAN MILLER FROM FINANCE. EXCUSE ME THANK YOU. FOR YOUR QUESTION- SO I IDEA I THINK THE FIRST THING I THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT. IS THAT IN JULY OF LAST YEAR- WE HAD ALLOCATED- SORRY I'M TRYING TO FIND THE EXACT NUMBER CORIO- TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS- TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS FROM FEDERAL ET DOT EPIDEMIOLOGY AND LABORATORY CAPACITY GRANDSON THAT WAS IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE OTHER- FUNDING THAT YOU HAD REFERENCED EARLIER AND THAT FUNDING WAS FOR TESTING IN CONTACT TRACING SO I THINK FIRST I NEED YOU KNOW START HIGHLIGHTING THAT- IN ADDITION TO THAT IN THE STATE CLEARLY HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW UNDERTAKING. BIG EFFORTS WITH THE VALENCIA BRANCH LAB- AND OTHER TESTING- IN CONTACT RECENT ACTIVITIES THE STATE HAS- I THINK- ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO ASSIST LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WITH THEIR CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS I THINK THAT'S BROUGHT THE TOTAL CONTACT TRACERS WITH- WITH LOCAL EMPLOYEES UP TO I THINK NEARLY TEN THOUSAND. CONTACT TRACERS- SO THAT I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS EFFORTS I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU I THINK YOU'RE ASKING MORE ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY MOSTLY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC OF COURSE- IN ADDITION TO THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ERICA I JUST MENTIONED- WE ALSO EXPECT ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR TESTING ACTIVITIES BUT IT APPEARS BASED ON GUIDANCE THAT THAT WE RECEIVED YESTERDAY THAT THE FUNDING ACTUALLY COULD ALSO BE USED FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDING CONTACT TRACING AND IN SOME VACCINATION ACTIVITIES AND SO I THINK WE'RE PLEASED THAT. THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE- YOU KNOW AND WE'RE WE'VE BEEN MEETING RECENTLY WITH A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABOUT THEIR NEEDS ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE OTHER YOU. KNOW SIERRA FEDERAL FUNDED CORONAVIRUS POLICE FUNDS AND THAT WAS THAT WERE. PROVIDED TO CARRY CARRIES. YOU KNOW STARTING RUN OUT AND HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE WILL BE. ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. YOU KNOW A PRO A PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF THESE- YOU KNOW ROUGHLY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW FEDERAL FUNDING- BUT CONCERNING THE BUDGET. I THINK I WOULD HIGHLIGHT- A PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IN THE IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO I REQUEST SOME FUNDING TO DO- SORT OF AFTER. AN AFTER COLLUDED YOU KNOW RETROSPECTIVE STUDY TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES CERTAINLY AND ALSO. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE HEALTHEQUITY- YOU KNOW- CHALLENGES THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED EVEN MORE BYE BYE COATED AND- AND- SO I THINK THAT. IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE CURRENT A PANDEMIC BEFORE WE KIND OF GET INTO SOME OF THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT PRIORITY I THINK IT THEN SPEAKS TO WHAT I STARTED WITH THIS IS THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATIONS SO I'M SITTING HERE GOING WE NEED TO EXPAND SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND YOU'RE TELLING WE HAVE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S GOING TO DO THAT. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE TONIGHT AND THAT WAY WE CAN EVALUATE IS THAT ENOUGH DO WE NEED TO DO MORE ODD MENTAL STATE MONEY IS IT GOOD ENOUGH IT CETERA. SO AGAIN BE ABLE TO HAVE THE WHOLE PICTURE IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT. AND BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADMINISTRATION THAT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THE FEDERAL MONIES CAN BE ALLOCATED WHERE SO THAT WERE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS ON THE STATE MONEY IS GONNA BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S ALSO WHY SO I THINK WE'RE COMING FULL CIRCLE HERE. YOUR ANSWER WILL BUILD IT MORE DEEPLY AND SUBCOMMITTEE BUT THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO KNOW. HOW THE SEASON'S GONNA BE MADE ON THE FEDERAL MONEY SO WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS ON THE STATE MONEY. SO PROCEED THAT. I GUESS FINAL POINT APPRECIATE THE BUILDINGS OF THE CHAIR- THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT HELPING HUMAN SERVICES THING- IN MY REGION YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD- AND- I'D- TRY DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE TO TRY TO USE THE GOVERNOR'S. A GOALS OF- OF BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE INCREASE HOUSING HAVING THE TRANSPORTATION GOES WITH IT AND DOING IN A GREEN WAY- SO. EVEN AS WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE. THE BOTH THE PANDEMIC. WILDFIRES OTHER CRISES AND I YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SAY THAT- THIS GOVERNOR AND UNFORTUNATELY SAID THE DEALS MORE CRISES- THAN I THINK MANY GOVERNORS HAS SO I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR. THAT I KNOW THAT SIR THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD. AND I THINK WE SHOULD EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR. HIS THE CHALLENGES HE HAS TO FACE TO DO THAT AND ALL OF YOU WORK FOR HIM. I HOPE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS MOVING FORWARD ESPECIALLY THEY DON'T REQUIRE MORE DOLLARS BUT ACTUALLY JUST ASK FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY IN EXISTINGDOLLARS SO. I'M JUST% GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE SO. WE COULD Y. STILL ACHIEVE SOME OF THE AIMS THAT HE TALKED ABOUT PRE CODED. THAT WE CAN DO IT. BY GIVING SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY TO EXISTING DOLLARS. I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND ADMINISTRATION BE FAVORABLE TO THAT US THINGS LIKE GREEN MEANS GO HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATES TIME. THANK YOU DR.
