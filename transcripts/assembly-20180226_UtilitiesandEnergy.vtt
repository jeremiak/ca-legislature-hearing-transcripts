BUT I THINK THAT WE WERE ALL

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:05.437 region:rollup2
VERY VERY MINDFUL OF LAST YEAR'S

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:07.573 region:rollup2

SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE

00:25:56.388 --> 00:26:00.926 region:rollup2
BIT OF A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.795 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN AS WE LOOK AT LAST

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:07.266 region:rollup2
YEAR'S ADVANCE AND THEN I WILL

00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:09.601 region:rollup2

THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED AS THE IN

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:13.739 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF OUR WORK WITH CAL

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.840 region:rollup2
FIRE. TRYING TO MITIGATE THE

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:18.410 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.846 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ON.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:23.415 region:rollup2
FOREST IN WILD LANDS AND I

00:26:20.846 --> 00:26:25.083 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY PROTECT

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:26.785 region:rollup2
THAT INVALUABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:29.188 region:rollup2
AGAINST FIRES ITSELF WHETHER

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.721 region:rollup2
THEY ARE CAUSED BY LIGHTNING OR

00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:32.091 region:rollup2
BY.

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:33.892 region:rollup2
BY OTHER UTILITIES ARE SOME

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:37.029 region:rollup2
OTHERS HOW FORCE.

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:39.631 region:rollup2
SO JUST KIND OF A FRAME.

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.866 region:rollup2
SINCE THE SINCE I'VE I'VE GOTTEN

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:42.401 region:rollup2
TO THE P. YOU SEE I DON'T THINK

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:44.403 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A YEAR WHERE THERE

00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:46.772 region:rollup2
ISN'T SOME KIND OF A CATASTROPHE

00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:48.140 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:50.242 region:rollup2
HAD ANTICIPATED.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.910 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY PREPARE FOR MOST OF

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:53.445 region:rollup2
THEM BUT WHEN THEY OCCUR THEY

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.247 region:rollup2
TEND TO REALLY OCCUPIER

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:57.683 region:rollup2
ATTENTION AND TEND TO.

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:58.283 region:rollup2
DISTRACT FROM THE MANY OTHER

00:26:57.683 --> 00:26:59.418 region:rollup2
TASKS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF

00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:00.686 region:rollup2
US.

00:26:59.418 --> 00:27:02.254 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER PETER MAN WHO'S

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:04.122 region:rollup2
BEEN THERE LONGER AND I HAVE

00:27:02.254 --> 00:27:05.724 region:rollup2
KIND OF REPORTS THAT THIS IS HER

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:07.259 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION AS WELL.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:09.128 region:rollup2
.

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:11.330 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:12.831 region:rollup2
THE DAY THESE THESE THESE THESE

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.633 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE NOT REALLY

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:16.568 region:rollup2
SIMILAR THEY INCLUDE SUCH

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:18.237 region:rollup2
DIVERSE THINKS IS THE SUDDEN

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:20.239 region:rollup2
CLOSURE OF A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:21.340 region:rollup2
LOCATED WEEK PORTION THE

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:23.542 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION GRID.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.344 region:rollup2
GAS PIPELINE EXPLOSIONS

00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:27.546 region:rollup2
UNCONTROLLED LEAKING UNDERGROUND

00:27:25.344 --> 00:27:29.248 region:rollup2
GAS STORAGE WELLS DROUGHTS

00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:32.551 region:rollup2
FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES

00:27:29.248 --> 00:27:33.685 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE WILL ON THAT THEM

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.654 region:rollup2
THOSE THE STATE'S MOST

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:37.890 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC FIRES WHICH A CAR

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:40.292 region:rollup2
AND WHAT LOOKS TO BE EXCEPT FOR

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.894 region:rollup2
TODAY. AAAH A YEAR ROUND FIRE

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:43.996 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:46.632 region:rollup2
SIR THIS IS THE FACT THAT OUR

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:49.301 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AT THE. A A A IS THE

00:27:46.632 --> 00:27:51.603 region:rollup2
HAVE AT THE HEAD HELLFIRE IS

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:53.772 region:rollup2
ALSO OBSERVING.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:55.507 region:rollup2
SO I'M PERSONALLY AFRAID THAT

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:56.909 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE PREPARATIONS THE P.

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.343 region:rollup2
YOU SEE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE

00:27:56.909 --> 00:28:00.245 region:rollup2
MAKING.

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.947 region:rollup2
THE SCALE THE SEVERITY IN THE

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.782 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY OF THESE MAJOR

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:04.850 region:rollup2
DISASTERS WITCHER SOME WHAT

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:06.251 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE LINKED TO

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.220 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:10.389 region:rollup2
MAY PROVE TO OVERWHELM OUR

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.824 region:rollup2
PLANNING ARE TIGHTER RULES IN

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:15.160 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES THE THE FEROCITY

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:17.529 region:rollup2
OF LAST YEAR'S WIND STORMS AND

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.231 region:rollup2
THE RELATED FIRES ARE FAR BEYOND

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.465 region:rollup2
PAST EXPERIENCE.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:22.568 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:24.002 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE MORE

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:25.671 region:rollup2
THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:27.372 region:rollup2
OF METEOROLOGY.

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:28.740 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:31.810 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SEEING THE CUTTING

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.946 region:rollup2
EDGE OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.181 region:rollup2
BUT ANYWAY THE YOU LOOK AT IT

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:37.449 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:39.651 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A REASONABLE BASIS TO

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:41.887 region:rollup2
PREPARE.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:43.622 region:rollup2
SO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:45.224 region:rollup2
ENDED THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT IN

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:47.492 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S RECORDED HISTORY.

00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:48.727 region:rollup2

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:52.297 region:rollup2
INFESTATIONS. THERE WERE

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:54.166 region:rollup2
SPREADING DUE TO WARMER A WINTER

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:56.068 region:rollup2

FIFTH OWNERS SIERRA FOREST

00:28:56.602 --> 00:29:00.772 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:01.306 region:rollup2
THIS DROUGHT ENDED WITH THE ONE

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:03.475 region:rollup2
OF THE WETTEST SEASONS ON

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:04.343 region:rollup2
RECORD.

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.444 region:rollup2
WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT

00:29:04.343 --> 00:29:08.513 region:rollup2
FLOODING.

PHONE.

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:13.418 region:rollup2
THAT WET SEASON ALSO CREATED

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:15.787 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FIRE FUELS AND MUCH

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:17.889 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AND

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:20.259 region:rollup2
IN THE WILDLAND INTERFACE THAT

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:22.327 region:rollup2
DUH THAT. CONSTITUTES WHERE

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:24.229 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:27.099 region:rollup2
ARE POSITIONED WELL WITHIN.

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:27.399 region:rollup2
HIGH HAZARD FEEL AREAS.

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.302 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:32.671 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRES AGAIN OR.

00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:34.373 region:rollup2
ARE OUTSTANDING EVEN IN THE

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.707 region:rollup2
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT'S NO

00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:39.411 region:rollup2
STRANGER TO.

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:40.912 region:rollup2
TURF TURFED OUR REGULAR FIRES.

00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:42.814 region:rollup2
THE FIRES ON A REGULAR BASIS THE

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:44.783 region:rollup2
THOMAS FIRE IS THE STATE'S

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:46.218 region:rollup2
LARGEST IN RECORDED HISTORY THAT

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.452 region:rollup2
FIRE RESULTED AND OVER TWO

00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:49.187 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY TO NINETY ONE

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:50.689 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRES BURN TWO HUNDRED

TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:55.761 region:rollup2
DESTROYED. AND.

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:56.928 region:rollup2
TRAGICALLY FORTY SEVEN SIX A

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:57.963 region:rollup2
HOME LIVES LOST

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:59.464 region:rollup2
QUOTING THE FIRES IN NORTHERN

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:01.366 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE CONDITIONS FOR

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:03.402 region:rollup2
THE THOMAS FIRE. ARE NOTABLE

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.036 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY DEPICT

00:30:03.402 --> 00:30:05.704 region:rollup2
THIS NEW NORMAL THAT WERE LIVING

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:07.472 region:rollup2
IN.

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:09.207 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:10.409 region:rollup2
THAT WE EXPECTED TEN YEARS AGO

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.710 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S BECOMING THE NEW NORMAL

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:14.046 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:16.114 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA REPORTED ZERO TWO ONE

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:17.883 region:rollup2
PERCENT HUMIDITY CONDITIONS AND

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:19.184 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES BURNED

00:30:17.883 --> 00:30:21.353 region:rollup2
IN JUST THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:23.155 region:rollup2
THE THOMAS FIRE.

00:30:21.353 --> 00:30:24.823 region:rollup2
AND I THE SANTA ANA WINDS WERE

00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:26.491 region:rollup2
FAR LESS FORGIVING THAN THEY

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:28.760 region:rollup2
HAVE EVER BEEN AND LASTING FOR

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.728 region:rollup2
TEN STRAIGHT DAYS.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.263 region:rollup2
THERE'S ARE THERE'S LITTLE

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:33.098 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT SEVERE WEATHER

00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:35.701 region:rollup2
EVENTS WE'RE EXPERIENCING ARE

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:37.102 region:rollup2
BECOMING MORE FREQUENT LONGER.

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:38.670 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN PERFORIN FOR A

00:30:37.102 --> 00:30:40.305 region:rollup2
RANGE OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS AND

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.907 region:rollup2
ALL DISCUSS SOME OF THE EFFORTS

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT INTO PLAYED A MAN

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:45.077 region:rollup2
MITIGATE THE RISK OF FIRE. WE

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.478 region:rollup2
GOT TO BE PREPARED TO PREVENT

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:48.613 region:rollup2
FIRES WERE WE CAN.

00:30:46.478 --> 00:30:50.415 region:rollup2
WHERE THE ROOT CAUSES MAY POINT

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:51.750 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS A

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:53.685 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF IGNITION?

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.320 region:rollup2
WAR WHERE THEY'RE EXCITED FROM

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:57.089 region:rollup2
OTHER SOURCES AND WHERE WERE

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.157 region:rollup2
PROTECTING A VERY VALUABLE

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:00.892 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RATE PAYERS

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:02.928 region:rollup2
WHO'VE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TO

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:04.663 region:rollup2
PUT INTO PLACE.

00:31:02.928 --> 00:31:06.231 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
ONGOING EFFORTS HAS BEEN TO

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:10.702 region:rollup2
REBUILD OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:12.904 region:rollup2
DIVISION AT THE CPUC.

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:15.207 region:rollup2
OUR I WON'T SPEND TIME HERE.

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:17.209 region:rollup2
HOA SINCE ARE THE DIRECT OF THE

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:18.643 region:rollup2
VISION LISA VADA MALASHENKO IS

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.945 region:rollup2
JOINING US HERE FROM FROM THE

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:21.613 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES US.

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:22.748 region:rollup2
CAN SPEAK TO SUM OF THE STUFF

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:24.282 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE WITHOUT AROUND FIRE

00:31:22.748 --> 00:31:25.350 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:26.885 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.453 region:rollup2
FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT STEPS

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:30.222 region:rollup2
WE TOOK WAS TO HIRE HER IS

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:31.690 region:rollup2
EXCEPTIONALLY CONFIDENT DIVISION

00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:33.225 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR TO HELP BUILD THE TEAM

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.527 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST TO FOCUS ON PUTTING

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:37.763 region:rollup2
SAFETY FIRST.

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:39.231 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT

00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:40.966 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TO WORK MORE CLOSELY

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:42.434 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER STATES SAFETY AGENCY

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:44.002 region:rollup2
SO UNDER OUR.

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:45.637 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR MALASHENKO IS

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:46.872 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP WE'VE ADOPTED TWO OH

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:48.507 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:50.308 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF

00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:51.443 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND WITH CAL

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:53.378 region:rollup2
FIRE

00:31:51.443 --> 00:31:55.280 region:rollup2
STATES OF FIREFIGHTING IN

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:57.282 region:rollup2
FORESTRY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.850 region:rollup2
A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR WORKING

00:31:57.282 --> 00:32:00.452 region:rollup2
CAO FIRE SPIN TO TRANSFORM THE

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.554 region:rollup2
STATE FIRE MAPS FROM ONE OF THE

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:03.889 region:rollup2
MODELS GENERAL FIRE HAS USED TO

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:06.324 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF THE ART MODEL WHICH

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:08.260 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON IGNITION RISKS.

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.794 region:rollup2
DUTY TILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.263 region:rollup2
DROUGHT EXTREME FIRE WIND

00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:13.532 region:rollup2
EVENTS.

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:14.766 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE ALSO ON STRENGTHENED

00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:16.635 region:rollup2
THE RULES FOR MANAGING

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:18.637 region:rollup2
VEGETATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:20.639 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC AND TELECOMMUNICATION

00:32:18.637 --> 00:32:23.308 region:rollup2
PULLS AND DISTRIBUTION.

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:24.142 region:rollup2
I DON'T MEAN TO TO TO PUT ALL

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.911 region:rollup2
THE WEIGHT HOA AND.

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:27.646 region:rollup2
HIGH AND THE ELECTRIC

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:29.414 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SOME FIRES ARE

00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:31.082 region:rollup2
CLEARLY RELATED TO FAILURE OF

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:33.685 region:rollup2
FULL OF TELECOMMUNICATION

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:35.387 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE COLOCATED ON

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:37.556 region:rollup2
THOSE POLLS WITH ELECTRIC.

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:39.424 region:rollup2
LINES.

00:32:37.556 --> 00:32:40.992 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:42.494 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A A COMPREHENSIVE

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:44.062 region:rollup2
DATABASE OF THE FOUR POINT TWO

00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:45.430 region:rollup2
MILLION.

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:47.065 region:rollup2
BORDEN POLL SICK CARRYING

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.366 region:rollup2
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHO OWNS

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.268 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:52.037 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UPDATED CONDITIONS.

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:53.004 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM.

00:32:52.037 --> 00:32:54.840 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE LOADING OF

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:56.174 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURES THAT COULD BE

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.609 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY WINS AND THEN

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:59.077 region:rollup2
SPENDING ACTUALLY CREE

00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:02.147 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:03.748 region:rollup2
FAILURE IN HEAVEN AND RISK OF OF

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:05.116 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD.

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:06.518 region:rollup2
SIR REFINING NEW RULES FOR

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.419 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WHICH WERE LACKING

00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:09.821 region:rollup2
WHEN.

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:12.090 region:rollup2
TELECOM EQUIPMENT ISN'T WELL

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:14.526 region:rollup2
MANAGED OR ISN'T CHANGED OVER A

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.561 region:rollup2
DIE IN A TIMELY FASHION OLDER

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:18.563 region:rollup2
WEAKER POLLS TO NEW PALTZ. ZA

00:33:16.561 --> 00:33:20.165 region:rollup2
COMMON PROBLEM WHERE AT THE TO

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:22.200 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DIFFERENT UTILITIES ARE

00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:23.935 region:rollup2
ALL USING A WOODEN POLE. DON'T

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.705 region:rollup2
MAKE THE CHANGEOVER TO A NEW

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:28.373 region:rollup2
STRONGER PULL ALL THE SAME TIME.

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:29.574 region:rollup2
SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO DIRECT EMAIL

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:31.376 region:rollup2
SHE COULD DISCUSS OUR WORK WITH

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:32.744 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE IN THE NEW HAS YOUR

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:34.513 region:rollup2
FIRE HAZARD MAPS THESE ARE VERY

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:37.082 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE DOCKED AT OUR FIRST

00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:38.216 region:rollup2
FIRE HAZARD MAP IS IN TRUMP. IN

00:33:37.082 --> 00:33:39.818 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ON THE

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.852 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION OF CALIFORNIA

00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:42.621 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED THEIR FIRE

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:44.422 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS TO GO OUT AND

00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:46.024 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COLLECT MORE DATA. IN

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.759 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF THAT PROCESS THE

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:50.695 region:rollup2
SCALE OF THAT DONUT THAT FIRE

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:52.564 region:rollup2
HAZARD. INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:54.566 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHAT I WILL DO IS

00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:55.967 region:rollup2
POINT OUT TOP LINE THAT MORE AND

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:57.168 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:59.671 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS OF.

00:33:57.168 --> 00:34:01.239 region:rollup2
ELEVATED AND SEVERE FIRE RISK

00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:03.108 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE TO THE

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:05.577 region:rollup2
HILLSIDES ARE MOVING INTO THE

00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:07.279 region:rollup2
CHAPARRAL THEY'RE MOVING INTO

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:09.447 region:rollup2
THE WELL FOR US.

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:11.283 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE

WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE OCCURS

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.685 region:rollup2

COUNTIES.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.826 region:rollup2
WELL WE FIND THAT NEARLY FOUR

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:23.461 region:rollup2
MILLION CALIFORNIA'S NOW LIVE IN

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:25.630 region:rollup2
THIS FOR HIGH FIRE.

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:27.699 region:rollup2
RISK AREAS THAT ARE DEFINED BY

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.100 region:rollup2
THE NEW FIRE HAZARD MAP. THAT'S

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.802 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.003 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:33.705 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT COACH

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:35.640 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:37.409 region:rollup2
YEAH AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN THE

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.977 region:rollup2
THE SIZE OF THE FIRE RISK AREAS

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:41.346 region:rollup2
GROWN DRAMATICALLY THE PREVIOUS

00:34:38.977 --> 00:34:43.782 region:rollup2
FIRE MAP. WHICH IS INTERFERE

00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:45.584 region:rollup2
THREAT MAP COVERED THIRTY ONE

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:47.652 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES THE NEW

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:50.055 region:rollup2
MAP MORE THAN DOUBLES THAT AT

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:53.124 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ARE PLUS THOUSAND SQUARE

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:55.894 region:rollup2
MILES. THAT'S FORTY FOUR PERCENT

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:57.595 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDMASS.

00:34:55.894 --> 00:35:00.532 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL

00:34:57.595 --> 00:35:02.300 region:rollup2
STATE DOES SURFACE AREA.

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:03.668 region:rollup2
THE NEW MAP ALSO INCLUDES THE

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.003 region:rollup2
THE TREE MORTALITY.

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:06.671 region:rollup2
HIGH HAZARD ZONES.

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:08.206 region:rollup2
WHICH ENCOMPASS NEARLY MINE

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:09.774 region:rollup2
MILLION ACRES IN ABOUT.

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:12.143 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.912 region:rollup2
TREES THAT DIE DUE TO DREW

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:15.447 region:rollup2
DROUGHT AND EMBARK BEATLES MUCH

00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:17.415 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS IN THE HIGH SIERRAS

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:17.816 region:rollup2
WHICH IS LESS DENSELY POPULATED

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.986 region:rollup2
HAS LESS ELECTRIC

00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:22.754 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:23.388 region:rollup2
SO WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER OUT

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:25.557 region:rollup2
FROM.

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:26.925 region:rollup2
THE DENSER URBAN CONCENTRATIONS

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:27.592 region:rollup2
THEIR NEED AND DEMAND FOR

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:29.794 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY AND

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:31.529 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:33.365 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUES.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:35.266 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE

00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:36.901 region:rollup2
LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:38.970 region:rollup2
POLLS THOSE WIRES GO OUT TO

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.637 region:rollup2
THOSE HOMES AND PROVIDE THEM

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.673 region:rollup2
WITH ELECTRICITY AND

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.741 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.710 region:rollup2
.

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:46.778 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.246 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT'S

00:35:46.778 --> 00:35:50.682 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL IS THAT WE'VE CREATED

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:53.518 region:rollup2
THIS VAST NETWORK OF POLES AND

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:55.754 region:rollup2
WIRES IT CONNECTS EVERY HOME.

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:57.956 region:rollup2
EVERY BUILDING EVERY BUSINESS IN

00:35:55.754 --> 00:35:59.491 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BRINGS

00:35:57.956 --> 00:36:01.493 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ELECTRICITY.

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:03.962 region:rollup2
BUT PHONE SERVICE.

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:05.397 region:rollup2
CABLE SERVICE AND FOOTBALL GAMES

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:07.165 region:rollup2
AND IT BRINGS PEOPLE ARE AND THE

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:09.534 region:rollup2
INTERNET.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:11.403 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:13.204 region:rollup2
PER DOLLAR SPENT.

00:36:11.403 --> 00:36:14.439 region:rollup2
THOSE WOODEN POLES AND THE

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:17.108 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THE SONNET IS

00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:18.677 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. THE

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:21.913 region:rollup2
TO CONSUMER INVESTMENT AND

00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:23.248 region:rollup2
CONSUMER VALUE. THAT WE MAKE.

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:25.517 region:rollup2
ON THE THEN YOU HAD THE

00:36:23.248 --> 00:36:27.152 region:rollup2
ANCILLARY INFRASTRUCTURE OF ALL

00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:29.454 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:30.889 region:rollup2
CONTROL AND MANAGE.

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:32.691 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE GET

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:35.326 region:rollup2
OVER THOSE POLLS WERE TALKING

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:38.196 region:rollup2
ABOUT A VAST MACHINE.

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:40.532 region:rollup2
THAT IS ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:42.667 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MORE VALUABLE THAN FOR

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:45.036 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE COMMODITY ELECTRONS

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:48.540 region:rollup2
THAT FLOW LONG.

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:49.841 region:rollup2
SO ARM.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.576 region:rollup2
THAT SAME TIME THOUGH THERE'S

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:53.478 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSING

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:55.380 region:rollup2
UNITS AND AND THREE POINT NINE

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:57.982 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.550 region:rollup2
THIS IS DID ABOUT TAUGHT TO IN

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.317 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.119 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:02.587 region:rollup2
LINES THAT CROSS THROUGH THE

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:04.622 region:rollup2
EXPANDING FIRE HOUSES ZONES TO

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:06.591 region:rollup2
SERVE THOSE POPULATIONS THAT ALL

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:09.227 region:rollup2
COMES WITH AN INHERENT RISK OF

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:11.362 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:12.797 region:rollup2
KERN THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ALL

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:14.265 region:rollup2
OF THIS WILL REQUIRE A SUSTAINED

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:15.934 region:rollup2
EFFORT BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:17.368 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ALL OF

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:18.603 region:rollup2
US TO STEP UP.

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:20.105 region:rollup2
ANNA AND DON'T THINK IT'S JUST

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:22.607 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES THE

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:24.576 region:rollup2
REGULATORS WE SEE A LARGE NEED

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:26.544 region:rollup2
FOR LOCAL LAND USE PLANNERS TO

00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:28.580 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THIS. I THINK

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:30.882 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT OUR.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:33.084 region:rollup2
REALLY. A CHALLENGE BUT WE NEED

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:34.319 region:rollup2
REAL CENTRAL MANAGEMENT OF THIS

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.886 region:rollup2
VALUABLE GRID.

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:36.521 region:rollup2
AND.

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:38.857 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IF YOU GO

00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:41.593 region:rollup2
INTO THE TO THIS NEW NORMAL AND

00:37:38.857 --> 00:37:42.427 region:rollup2
I JUST SAY PARENTHETICALLY.

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.462 region:rollup2
THAT I'M.

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:46.431 region:rollup2
I'M NOT.

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:48.700 region:rollup2
I'M NOT REALLY.

00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:50.668 region:rollup2
FOR UTILITIES AGAINST UTILITIES

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.036 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT FOR OTHER FOR WAYS THAT

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.238 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GET THEIR ENERGY OR

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:56.241 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM.

00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:58.042 region:rollup2
I AM HERE TO SPEAK FOR THE THAT

00:37:56.241 --> 00:38:00.445 region:rollup2
THAT INANIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:02.280 region:rollup2
THAT SO VALUABLE TO US THAT THAT

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:04.649 region:rollup2
NEVER HAS A VOICE.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.750 region:rollup2
I REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.485 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEBODY TO SPEAK TO THAT

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.487 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:11.289 region:rollup2
ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT MANAGES

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:13.491 region:rollup2
THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY AND

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:14.392 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALONG THAT

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.094 region:rollup2
NETWORK THAT CONNECTS OF THOSE

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:18.196 region:rollup2
HOMES.

00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:20.431 region:rollup2
AND BUSINESSES IN COMMUNITIES

00:38:18.196 --> 00:38:21.866 region:rollup2
AND BRINGS THEM INTO THE TO TO

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:24.002 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA.

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE THINK THAT

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:27.572 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE THING

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:29.741 region:rollup2
THAT I STAND FOR HERE. IS.

00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:31.509 region:rollup2
BOTH.

00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:34.045 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:35.647 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING IT.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.515 region:rollup2
KEEPING IT SAFE BECAUSE SAFE

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:38.383 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T HURT

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.884 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE DOESN'T HURT THE

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:41.820 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:43.822 region:rollup2
AND ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.825 region:rollup2
REPLENISH IT AS TIME GOES ALONG

00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:49.093 region:rollup2
THAT IS MY MY MISSION IN AT THE

00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:50.895 region:rollup2
P. C. STUDENT REALLY SPEAK FOR

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:52.630 region:rollup2
THE UNANIMOUS.

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:55.266 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S A HARD

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.935 region:rollup2
CONCEPT TO GET ACROSS.

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:58.536 region:rollup2
BUT WITHOUT SOMEBODY TO REALLY

00:38:56.935 --> 00:39:00.738 region:rollup2
STAND FOR THAT.

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:02.774 region:rollup2
IT WILL FAIL.

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:04.876 region:rollup2
IT WILL FAIL.

00:39:02.774 --> 00:39:06.244 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T JUST BE A POLICY AGENCY

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:07.745 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T JUST BE A FINANCE

00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:09.781 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:11.683 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED

00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:13.384 region:rollup2
ROLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:15.420 region:rollup2
GOOD THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHINING

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:17.488 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ULTIMATELY

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.557 region:rollup2
THE BENEFICIARIES? ALLOWING THE

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:22.327 region:rollup2
WAY SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE THAT

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:25.063 region:rollup2
VOICE FOR THE INANIMATE.

00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:26.197 region:rollup2
SO TIME AND I DON'T THINK THAT

00:39:25.063 --> 00:39:27.365 region:rollup2
THE GRID ITSELF IS SOMETHING

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.067 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE PIECE MAILED OUT

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:32.670 region:rollup2
EASILY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:34.339 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GIVE TO FIFTY A.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:36.107 region:rollup2
KICK COUNTIES IN FOREIGN FIFTY

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.041 region:rollup2
EIGHT CITIES AND EXPECTED TO

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:39.978 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:40.778 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:42.647 region:rollup2
IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOME

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:44.415 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT SO THAT

00:39:42.647 --> 00:39:45.416 region:rollup2
AT THE AT THE BORDERS OF ALL THE

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:47.118 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POLITICAL

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:49.087 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS YOU DON'T HAVE

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:50.889 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT VOLTAGES.

00:39:49.087 --> 00:39:53.524 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT DOES

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:55.493 region:rollup2
OWN CYCLES OF ELECTRIC FLOW YOU

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:58.196 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE CHANGES IN THE THE

00:39:55.493 --> 00:40:00.098 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:01.532 region:rollup2
SO SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:04.435 region:rollup2
CENTRAL MANAGEMENT THAT IS

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO GO AWAY ANY MORE

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:08.740 region:rollup2
THAN THEY NEED TO HAVE. ONE ROOF

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:11.542 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED AGENCIES TO POLICE

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.811 region:rollup2
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST THE

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:15.513 region:rollup2
OF ENCROACHMENT BY VEGETATION.

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:16.948 region:rollup2
AND TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:21.319 region:rollup2
THE THE RISK OF FIRE

00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:23.821 region:rollup2
ELECTROCUTION.

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:24.555 region:rollup2
SO I'D I'D I'D BOY JUST KINDA

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:27.025 region:rollup2
SAY.

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:28.126 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:29.093 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE FLEXIBILITY WHERE

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:30.495 region:rollup2
THEY CAN CLING GET THEIR

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:32.263 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:34.499 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY ON

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:34.732 region:rollup2
THE POLLS.

00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:36.601 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:38.236 region:rollup2
.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
HER NEW FIRE RULES ARE JUST THE

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:41.639 region:rollup2
TOUGHEST IN THE COUNTRY AND

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.308 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:47.979 region:rollup2
TO WE CAN GET BETTER AT SETTING

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.846 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND WE CAN REQUIRE

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:50.715 region:rollup2
MORE EXPECTATIONS AND MORE

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:52.917 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE.

00:40:50.715 --> 00:40:55.586 region:rollup2
BUT WITH THIS EXPANDING FIRE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:57.121 region:rollup2
RISK FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WITH

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:58.923 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY OF THE FIRES THE

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:01.526 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY THE FIRES THE GROWING

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:04.495 region:rollup2
POPULATION THIS FIRE ZONES.

00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:06.130 region:rollup2
THE ON GOING REQUIREMENTS FOR.

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:08.466 region:rollup2
INFIX RUPTURE THEY CARRY

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:11.202 region:rollup2
RESIDUAL RISK IN A IS AT RISK OF

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.703 region:rollup2
FIRE IS PERFECT SAFETY IS REALLY

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.871 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO

00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:15.606 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE.

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:17.842 region:rollup2
SAYS THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:19.844 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE STATE LAST MONTH WE

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:20.445 region:rollup2
CAN'T JUST FIGHT NATURE WE HAVE

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.280 region:rollup2
TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH

00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:23.848 region:rollup2
HER.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.484 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:27.952 region:rollup2
THIS NEW NORMAL AND DIE WE NEED

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:30.088 region:rollup2
TO START OPERATING DIFFERENTLY

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:32.724 region:rollup2
FROM THE GROUND UP. AND THAT WE

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:34.959 region:rollup2
ME MAY MEAN THREE HINKING WHERE

00:41:32.724 --> 00:41:36.494 region:rollup2
AND HOW DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AND

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.696 region:rollup2
HOW AND THE NATURE THAT

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:40.965 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT WE HADN'T ON BONK

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:43.568 region:rollup2
WHERE THE FIRE SCIENTISTS IN THE

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:45.703 region:rollup2
FIRE ENGINEERS ARE VERY CLEAR.

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:47.538 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEEDED TO DESIGN HOMES

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:48.806 region:rollup2
NEW HOMES IN THESE FIRE HAZARD

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.174 region:rollup2
AREAS TO BE MORE RESISTANT TO

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
FIRE.

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:53.211 region:rollup2
AND THOSE BUILDING CODES ARE NOT

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:55.012 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE P. YOU SEE

00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:56.748 region:rollup2
CAN EITHER SAT.

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:58.950 region:rollup2
OR ENFORCED SO WE NEED TO HAVE

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:00.685 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP BOTH

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.620 region:rollup2
WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES. BUT WE

00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:04.422 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE THAT THAT UP AND

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.723 region:rollup2
DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:08.159 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:09.660 region:rollup2
THIS WORK.

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:10.928 region:rollup2
SELL OUT ALL SHOWED UP HERE IN

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.196 region:rollup2
THE AND.

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:19.470 region:rollup2
EITHER TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS OR

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:20.605 region:rollup2
TURN IT TO DIRECTOR MALASHENKO.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:23.207 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:24.609 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY.

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:26.711 region:rollup2
AND LEAD THE SAFETY AND

WHICH INCLUDES OVER SLATE OF

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:32.583 region:rollup2
UTILITY AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:33.684 region:rollup2
THE PRIME PRIMARY MANDATE OF THE

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:35.119 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT GROUP WAS

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:37.221 region:rollup2
TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH

REGULATIONS AS WELL.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:47.165 region:rollup2
THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY DONE

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:49.100 region:rollup2
THROUGH AUDITS INFRASTRUCTURE

00:42:47.165 --> 00:42:51.135 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS IN THE FIELD AND

INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.871 region:rollup2
IN THE ELECTRIC SAFETY PROGRAM

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:55.473 region:rollup2
THE GROUP CONDUCTS SOMEWHERE

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:57.275 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY AUDITS

00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:58.709 region:rollup2
A YEAR. NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE

AUDITS THE TYPICALLY LAST WEEK

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:01.979 region:rollup2
AND A HALF

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.513 region:rollup2
AT THE HEART OF THAT TIME IS

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.881 region:rollup2
SPENT ON INFECTIONS IN THE

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:05.149 region:rollup2
FIELD.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.484 region:rollup2
AND AM DEAL THE GROUP ALSO

INCIDENTS AND CUSTOMER

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:12.590 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:13.858 region:rollup2
TODAY I AM GOING TO BEGIN BY

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.593 region:rollup2
PROVIDING YOU WITH SOME

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:16.627 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISK OF

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.963 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES FROM UTILITY

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:21.065 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN DISCUSS

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:23.468 region:rollup2
THE ALBUM.

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:25.903 region:rollup2
A HOW THESE RISKS CAN BE REDUCED

00:43:23.468 --> 00:43:27.672 region:rollup2
AND MITIGATED.

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:28.906 region:rollup2
SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:30.441 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HAS REQUIRED THE

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:32.076 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:34.178 region:rollup2
REPORT ALL KNOWN FIRE.

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:36.214 region:rollup2
FIRES IGNITED BY ELECTRIC

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:37.381 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THE UTILITIES

00:43:36.214 --> 00:43:39.350 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT INFORMATION ON AN

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.451 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BASIS.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.120 region:rollup2
FOR THE YEARS FROM TWENTY

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:43.421 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.890 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE LATEST DATA THAT WE

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:48.226 region:rollup2
HAVE THE UTILITIES HAVE REPORTED

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:50.061 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY FOURTEEN HUNDRED FIRE

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:51.629 region:rollup2
IGNITION INCIDENTS.

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.397 region:rollup2
MOST OF THESE ARE MINOR

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:55.466 region:rollup2
INVOLVING FIRES THAT A LESS THAN

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:57.502 region:rollup2
A QUARTER OF AN EAGER. AND ARE

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:59.337 region:rollup2
EASILY PUT OUT SO OR EVEN GO OUT

00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:01.038 region:rollup2
BY THEMSELVES.

00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:02.340 region:rollup2
HOW OVER THIS DATA PROVIDES GOOD

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:04.575 region:rollup2
STARTING POINT FOR BETTER ON THE

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.376 region:rollup2
STANDING THE RISK OF WILDFIRE

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.278 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:08.980 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE?

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:10.548 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT DOES THE TO SHOWS IS

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.250 region:rollup2
THAT THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL

00:44:10.548 --> 00:44:14.151 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF FIRE IGNITIONS IS

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.987 region:rollup2
CONTACT FROM OBJECT MOST

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.321 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY VEGETATION.

00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:19.290 region:rollup2
CONCEPT FROM VEGETATION WITHOUT

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:21.292 region:rollup2
A FACILITY FAILURE LEADING UP TO

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.460 region:rollup2
THE CONTACT ACCOUNTS FOR ROUGHLY

00:44:21.292 --> 00:44:24.195 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.763 region:rollup2
EXTENSIONS.

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:27.698 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A TREE

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:31.068 region:rollup2
FALLING DOWN OR BRANCHES FALLING

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:32.270 region:rollup2
OFF AND A GOING INTO ENERGIZED

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:34.305 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.406 region:rollup2
CATCHING ON FIRE.

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:37.175 region:rollup2
THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.709 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS IS UTILITY EQUIPMENT

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:40.311 region:rollup2
FAILURE MOST FREQUENTLY A

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:42.413 region:rollup2
CONDUCTOR WILL CONDUCT DISPLACE

00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:43.447 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:45.116 region:rollup2
FAILURE OF CONDUCTORS AND

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.583 region:rollup2
SPLICES ACCOUNT FOR JUST UNDER

00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:48.019 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:49.487 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:51.489 region:rollup2
THEREFORE AN AGGREGATE

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:53.291 region:rollup2
VEGETATION CONTACT AND CONDUCT

00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:54.692 region:rollup2
THE FAILURE ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:55.760 region:rollup2
HALF OF WILL OF THE IGNITION'S

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:57.628 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRIC

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.163 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:01.098 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THOSE TWO

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.733 region:rollup2
CAUSES THERE AREN'T VERY CLEAR

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:03.968 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OF IGNITIONS AND

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:05.336 region:rollup2
IGNITION NUMBERS FOR EACH

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:06.871 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE TEND TO BE

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:08.639 region:rollup2
MUCH SMALLER.

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:11.409 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER ONES INCLUDES

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:14.245 region:rollup2
A VEHICLE ACCIDENTS ANIMALS

00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:17.348 region:rollup2
BALLOONS OF WIRE TO WIRE CONTACT

00:45:14.245 --> 00:45:18.849 region:rollup2
AND OTHER THINGS.

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:21.752 region:rollup2
A WELFARE NEEDS THREE THINGS IN

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:23.254 region:rollup2
ORDER TO DEVELOP ONE IS FUEL.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:25.590 region:rollup2
SECOND IS ADMISSION FORESTS AND

00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:27.225 region:rollup2
THREE WEATHER CONDITIONS.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:29.360 region:rollup2
WHEN WE THINK OF WILDFIRE RISK

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:30.595 region:rollup2
REDUCTION POLICIES WE CAN THINK

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.164 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST STORY GETTING

00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:35.499 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE SLOW

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:37.201 region:rollup2
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A FIRE TRIANGLE.

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:39.236 region:rollup2
FIRST WE CAN LOOK AT REDUCING

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:40.204 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF FUEL.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.439 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR GIVES TO

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:42.907 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE TWENTY FIVE

00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:44.642 region:rollup2
PERCENTS OF UTILITY RELATED

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:46.677 region:rollup2
TECHNICIANS

00:45:44.642 --> 00:45:48.012 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WELL OU TO VEGETATION

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:50.047 region:rollup2
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:51.582 region:rollup2
ENERGIZED FACILITIES.

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:53.484 region:rollup2
FOR UTILITIES OPERATIONS

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:55.353 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE DOMAIN

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:56.887 region:rollup2
OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:58.589 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST.

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:01.525 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:02.627 region:rollup2
EXPENSES OF FOUR OF FOR ANY

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:06.130 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

00:46:02.627 --> 00:46:08.933 region:rollup2
IN OUR CALIFORNIA THE INVESTOR

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.067 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES WELL SPEND.

00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:11.836 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:13.638 region:rollup2
OVER ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

00:46:15.039 --> 00:46:19.377 region:rollup2
EXPENSES AND IF YOU REALLY COUNT

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:21.646 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF YOU FACILITIES SO THAT

00:46:19.377 --> 00:46:23.948 region:rollup2
MEANS. THE GAS UTILITIES THAT

00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:27.385 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN RIGHT OF WAYS OF THE

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:28.886 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES OWE.

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:32.156 region:rollup2
IT WE'RE TALKING SOMEWHERE

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:33.524 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A HALF A BILLION IN THE

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:36.560 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT ALL

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:37.728 region:rollup2
OF THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.362 region:rollup2

ELVES SOON WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.653 region:rollup2
ALREADY DOING ALL ALONG WHAT'S

00:47:34.552 --> 00:47:38.522 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OUR POLICIES AND

00:47:35.653 --> 00:47:40.358 region:rollup2

ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:47:40.358 --> 00:47:43.828 region:rollup2
CALM HOWEVER.

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:46.130 region:rollup2
THIS CONTINUES TO BE.

00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:49.300 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE HOME.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:51.202 region:rollup2
MAIN DRIVER OFF IGNITIONS AND WE

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.170 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:55.406 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE AREA OF

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.707 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENTS TO REDUCE

00:47:55.406 --> 00:47:57.508 region:rollup2
THOSE RISKS.

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.310 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME ADVANCED

00:47:57.508 --> 00:48:00.611 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.046 region:rollup2
THE OUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.613 region:rollup2
PROGRESS DONE THAT WOULD LIGHT

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:05.983 region:rollup2
OR.

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:09.253 region:rollup2
TYPE SURVEYING ó YOU CAN LET

00:48:05.983 --> 00:48:10.955 region:rollup2
GO UPLOADS DATA AND USE EL AL

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:13.457 region:rollup2
ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO BETTER

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:15.459 region:rollup2
PINPOINTS. O. GROWTH PATTERNS

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:17.661 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE.

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:19.330 region:rollup2
YOU ME HOW OF WELL VEGETATION

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:21.031 region:rollup2
COMING INTO CONTACT SO THEY EVEN

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.900 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE'VE DONE A GREAT DEAL

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:24.335 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA ON THAT

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.204 region:rollup2
WAS STOLE CAN BUILD UPON THIS

00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:27.905 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND LOOK AT FURTHER.

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.907 region:rollup2
ELM

00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:31.709 region:rollup2
FUEL REDUCTION AT ALL POLICIES

00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:33.144 region:rollup2
RELATED TO UTILITY VEGETATION

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:34.812 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AS A AND THE STATE AS

00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:35.980 region:rollup2
A WHOLE.

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:37.782 region:rollup2
SECOND WE CAN LOOK AT THAT

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.850 region:rollup2
MISSION CONTROL POLICIES.

00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:41.252 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS AN AREA TO FOCUS ON

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.720 region:rollup2
HARDENING YEAH UTILITY

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:44.522 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.423 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO COMMISSION SOURCE

00:48:44.522 --> 00:48:48.726 region:rollup2
THAT THE STAKES OF THIS IS WHERE

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:50.528 region:rollup2
UTILITIES CAN WORK TO MINIMIZE

00:48:48.726 --> 00:48:52.496 region:rollup2
CONDUCTANCE PLACE FAILURE. ALL

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:54.031 region:rollup2
THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE CONDUCT THE

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:56.267 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS.

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:59.036 region:rollup2
IN USING INFRARED SCANNING TO

00:48:56.267 --> 00:49:01.071 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL WELL SPLICES

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:02.206 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE HAVING ISSUES.

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:04.909 region:rollup2
ALSO INVESTMENTS IN GRID MORE IN

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:05.910 region:rollup2
THIS NATION OR SMART GRIDEL

00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:08.779 region:rollup2
LEASE IN THE PORT AND FOUNDATION

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:10.381 region:rollup2
FOR WELL IGNITION CONTROL. OF

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.582 region:rollup2
THIS A LAW THAT CAN BE DONE AT

00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:12.583 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT THAT MISSION BY

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:14.485 region:rollup2
ADVANCE FULL.

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:16.120 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS AND REMOTELY

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:17.988 region:rollup2
ADJUSTING SETTINGS ON THE.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.089 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE DEVICES SUCH AS

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.558 region:rollup2
RECORDERS

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:21.959 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE OF

00:49:20.558 --> 00:49:23.794 region:rollup2
THE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:25.429 region:rollup2
EVEN YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:27.298 region:rollup2
THE FROM COULD NOT TEN YEARS AGO

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:28.566 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY WHEN YOU

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:30.868 region:rollup2
HOW DID WE CLOSER IN AND THE

00:49:28.566 --> 00:49:32.236 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE DEVICE YOU HALL OF.

00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:34.171 region:rollup2
SETTINGS THAT COME WITH THAT YOU

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:35.673 region:rollup2
INSTALL IT IN THE FIELD AND THEN

00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:37.641 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE HOME

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:39.210 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO SEND THE CREW OUT TO

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:40.744 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO THAT

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.546 region:rollup2
THE VICE IT'S VERY VERY WELL

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:44.315 region:rollup2
COST PROHIBITIVE TO CHANGE THE

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:45.483 region:rollup2
SETTINGS ON THE FREQUENT BASIS.

00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:47.518 region:rollup2
IN IF YOU SET THEM TO BEAT SO

00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:49.086 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE THAT REALLY BECOMES A

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:50.821 region:rollup2
MAJOR RELIABILITY PROBLEM

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:53.090 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU KNOW THE

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:55.593 region:rollup2
SQUIRREL NINA JUMPS ON THE LINE

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.160 region:rollup2
IT TRIPS IN THE U. HOPES THEN

00:49:55.593 --> 00:49:56.393 region:rollup2
THE CREW AND RESET THE WHOLE

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.828 region:rollup2
THING.

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.829 region:rollup2
SO SMART GRID INVESTMENT THE

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.598 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:02.032 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ALBUM IN THE STATE AND

00:50:00.598 --> 00:50:03.801 region:rollup2
THEN PUT POLICY THAT THE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:06.036 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HAS PROMOTED. THAT

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:07.371 region:rollup2
AGAIN A THING FROM A TECHNOLOGY

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:09.640 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW LAYS ON THE PORT

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:12.376 region:rollup2
AND FOUNDATION THAT WE CAN BUILD

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:15.079 region:rollup2
UPON SO NOW USE ELM THOSE

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:16.413 region:rollup2
DEVICES USE THE A COMMUNICATIONS

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:18.148 region:rollup2
NETWORKS THAT WE GET SOLID IS

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:21.218 region:rollup2
HELP THE POOR ID. ALAM AND

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:24.021 region:rollup2
REALLY BE. SOULES ALUM.

TO GET MORE ADVANCED WITH.

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:28.259 region:rollup2
HOW UTILITIES ARE MANAGING OWE

00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:30.394 region:rollup2

THAT THE THE LESS

TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:37.301 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSIONS ABOUT STARTING TO

00:50:40.004 --> 00:50:43.707 region:rollup2
LASTLY EL PROGRESS ON WELFARE

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:45.509 region:rollup2
PREVENTION CAN BE MADE BY

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.478 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON WHETHER PREPAREDNESS

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:48.612 region:rollup2

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:50.334 region:rollup2
POINTS EL THAT THE IGNITION HAS

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:51.735 region:rollup2
TAKEN PLACE AND DEPLOY A EL OF

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:54.438 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTING CREWS TO PUT

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:55.739 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OUT. OF THE THE HIGH

00:52:54.438 --> 00:52:58.242 region:rollup2
YOU CHANCES ARE THAT YOU'LL

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:59.910 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PREVENTS ELM

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:02.780 region:rollup2
A DISASTER.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:05.549 region:rollup2
A ONE OF THE ELBOW PROGRAMS THAT

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:07.851 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC USES

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:11.422 region:rollup2
IS THEY PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZE

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:13.657 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC LINES EL. AS THE. LAST

00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:15.759 region:rollup2
RESORT MEASURE FOR L. RISK

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:18.128 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:20.864 region:rollup2
CALM IT'S A POLL A PROGRAM THAT

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:22.499 region:rollup2
THE P. C. HOUSE AUTHORIZED FORCE

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:24.234 region:rollup2
AND YOU GAS ELECTRIC.

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:25.803 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:27.337 region:rollup2
ANALYZING HOW IT'S BEEN WORKING

00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
FOR THE ALMOND AND LESSONS

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:30.407 region:rollup2
LEARNED THAT CAN BE APPLIED THE

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:32.409 region:rollup2
TO THE REST OF THE STATE'S.

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:34.111 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.512 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM FOR THEM IS THAT

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:37.147 region:rollup2
THEY DO HOME OF THIS VERY

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:38.882 region:rollup2
GRANULAR BEAD AND SITUATIONAL

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:41.452 region:rollup2
AWARENESS.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:42.686 region:rollup2
YEAH AND OWE A LOT OF SMART GRID

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:44.021 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ON THEIR SYSTEMS

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.656 region:rollup2
FOR THE ABLE TO SURGICALLY

00:53:44.021 --> 00:53:47.524 region:rollup2
PINPOINT THE EXACT CIRCUIT THE

00:53:45.656 --> 00:53:49.560 region:rollup2
EXACT LINE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE A

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:52.996 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. IN WHEN THEY'RE.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:55.599 region:rollup2
DOING D. ENERGIZING. THE HOW OF

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:56.400 region:rollup2
OLD METHODS IN PLACE TO TRY TO

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:59.503 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:02.039 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE ALL OF THE.

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:03.941 region:rollup2
A POLICY THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED

00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:04.975 region:rollup2
IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT WHETHER

00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:08.011 region:rollup2
PREPAREDNESS IN WHAT THE

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:10.314 region:rollup2
RESPONSE. AND HOW WE REALLY CAN

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:14.585 region:rollup2
BE ERA GETTING BETTER AT THE

00:54:10.314 --> 00:54:16.053 region:rollup2
STATE'S. O. OF MOBILIZING ELM

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.521 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF A FIRE STARTING.

00:54:16.053 --> 00:54:20.758 region:rollup2
AND REALLY TREATING THOSE FIRE

00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:22.192 region:rollup2
THREAT CONDITIONS OWE THEM AS

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:24.595 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE STORM AS AN

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:25.662 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT.

00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:27.831 region:rollup2
IN THE DISTANCE WORKING ON

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:29.900 region:rollup2
POLICY THE CPC IS INVESTIGATING

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:32.136 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES IN

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.370 region:rollup2
PARALLEL WITH CAL FIRE. LAST

00:54:32.136 --> 00:54:35.272 region:rollup2
YEAR WAS SIGNED IN THE

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.840 region:rollup2
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:38.442 region:rollup2
ALL THAT IN THE BILL'S THE TWO

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:40.010 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO BETTER COORDINATE

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:42.379 region:rollup2
AND COLLABORATE ON INCIDENT

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:45.349 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS. HELP PRIOR TO

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:47.785 region:rollup2
THE SIGNING OF THIS AMMO YOU EL

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
THE CPC STAFF CUTS WAITS UNTIL

00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:51.355 region:rollup2
THE CONCLUSION OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.756 region:rollup2
EAR O. INVESTIGATION AND. NO TO

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:54.725 region:rollup2
DETERMINE BECAUSE BEFORE WE

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:55.359 region:rollup2
COULD BEGIN OUR OWN

00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:56.493 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:58.395 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN THE

00:54:56.493 --> 00:55:00.464 region:rollup2
MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS WELL WE KNOW

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:02.366 region:rollup2
LONGER HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:03.467 region:rollup2
TO A YEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA OR

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:05.335 region:rollup2
TWO TO FINISH INCOME WITH

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:07.337 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS WERE SHARING

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:09.072 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. WELL WITH EACH

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:10.474 region:rollup2
OTHER AS OUR INVESTIGATIONS ARE

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:12.676 region:rollup2
GOING ALONG WITH HEALTH

00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:14.878 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FOCUSES ALAKAL FIRE

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:16.880 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IS REALLY LOOKING

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:18.549 region:rollup2
AT HOLD THE FIRE GOODNIGHT AND

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.051 region:rollup2
HOW THAT IT SPREAD OUR

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:22.519 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION OF THE CPU SEE. IS

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
LOOKING OUT THE UTILITY

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:25.622 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENTS ASSAULT WOULD WHO

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE OF

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:30.127 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:31.228 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO EVEN BEYOND VIOLATIONS

00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:33.330 region:rollup2
WERE THERE AND YOU BEST

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:36.466 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AS ANY LESSONS LEARNED

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:37.568 region:rollup2
SO OUR FOCUS WAS MORE

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:38.235 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY UTILITIES.

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:39.403 region:rollup2
AND WORK HEALTH WIRES PROVIDING

00:55:38.235 --> 00:55:42.539 region:rollup2
US WITH THE EXPERTISE THAT

00:55:39.403 --> 00:55:44.374 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC EL TO FIREFIGHTING.

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:45.642 region:rollup2
AND FIRE MITIGATION ALL WE'RE

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:47.678 region:rollup2
PROVIDING HELLFIRE WITH

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:50.013 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AROUND UTILITY LINES

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:51.849 region:rollup2
IN AND OUT HOW UTILITY EL

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:53.817 region:rollup2
NETWORKS WORK.

00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:55.886 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BEEN A VERY FRUITFUL OUR

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:58.021 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK WE CAN

00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:59.690 region:rollup2
THE L.. BUILDING ON THE I FELT

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:02.125 region:rollup2
THE TWO AGENCIES WERE ONLY BE

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:05.062 region:rollup2
ABLE TO EVEN BETTER WELL PREPARE

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:07.164 region:rollup2
AND RESPOND. CALM IN THE FUTURE.

00:56:05.062 --> 00:56:10.234 region:rollup2
.

00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:13.103 region:rollup2
WE GO WHEN OUR INVESTIGATIONS

00:56:10.234 --> 00:56:15.639 region:rollup2
WELL CONCLUDE AT ALL THE C. P.%

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:16.907 region:rollup2
C. L. HOUSE ABILITY TO TAKE

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:19.576 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST

00:56:16.907 --> 00:56:21.211 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WE CAN FIND THEM UP TO

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:23.947 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.515 region:rollup2
VIOLATION PER DAY. AND ALSO

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:28.452 region:rollup2
ASSESS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:31.421 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:33.991 region:rollup2
SITUATION. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:35.225 region:rollup2
FEES THAT WE GET INTO AFTER THE

00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:38.262 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE.

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:39.196 region:rollup2
WELL RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS

00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:40.998 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY TO CONDUCT

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:43.600 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND TO FIGURE OUT

00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:45.235 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. AND SO

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.738 region:rollup2
ALSO CALLED.

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:49.439 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT. HOW WE CAN BUILD

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:51.975 region:rollup2
UPON THE FOUNDATION THAT WE ARE

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:54.044 region:rollup2
DE HOW OF ELM IN THINK ALL OF

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:55.679 region:rollup2
NEW WELL MEASURES THAT CAN BE

00:56:54.044 --> 00:56:57.281 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE?

00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:58.649 region:rollup2
FROM ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT

00:56:57.281 --> 00:57:00.350 region:rollup2
I'VE DONE IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:02.152 region:rollup2
FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE TO

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.854 region:rollup2
FINDING YOU LOW HANGING FRUIT AT

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:05.789 region:rollup2
THOSE POINTS. WE'VE ALREADY DONE

00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:07.491 region:rollup2
MORE IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANYWHERE

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:09.593 region:rollup2
ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM

00:57:07.491 --> 00:57:12.429 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND. EL

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:14.164 region:rollup2
IN YOU LESSONS LEARNED EL. A

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:15.966 region:rollup2
REALLY COMING FROM. OTHER

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:17.934 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES AUSTRALIA HAS DONE THE

00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:20.137 region:rollup2
LOTS IN NEW ZEALAND'S IN TERMS

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:21.204 region:rollup2
OF FIRE PREVENTION AND ALSO

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:22.739 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:24.641 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THERE BUT IT'S GOING

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:27.644 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A LOT OF INNOVATIVE

00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:28.779 region:rollup2
THINKING. ELM TO REALLY MOVE

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:31.248 region:rollup2
WELL PAST

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:33.550 region:rollup2
ALL THE LEVEL OMIT WHICH WERE AT

00:57:31.248 --> 00:57:34.985 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT OF HOW TO ADDRESS

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.486 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING

00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:38.822 region:rollup2
AS THE STATE'S.

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:41.058 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I THINK WITH THE.

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:42.592 region:rollup2
WARRANTS CHRONOLOGY THIS AND

00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:44.194 region:rollup2
WITH THE COLLABORATIVE

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:45.996 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AMONG

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:48.198 region:rollup2
THAT THE FRIENDS AND CITIES IN

00:57:45.996 --> 00:57:50.167 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. EL WHICH WE CAN'T DO

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:52.569 region:rollup2
HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CAN

00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:54.004 region:rollup2
OUT MADE FURTHER PROGRESS.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:55.906 region:rollup2
TWO WELL PREVENT SUCH

00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:57.741 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS FROM

00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:59.309 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.

00:57:57.741 --> 00:58:01.078 region:rollup2
HOME SO THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:02.913 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO

00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:05.215 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO WORKING WITH YOU

00:58:02.913 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
THE CPC LEADER CHAPA CAL FIRE.

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:08.919 region:rollup2
L..

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:10.854 region:rollup2
TWO I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE WE

00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:12.489 region:rollup2
CAN DO FOR THE FUTURE. AND THANK

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:13.223 region:rollup2

YOUR PRESENTATION. WAS VERY

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:27.371 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE.

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:29.172 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU KNOW WERE ALL TRYING

00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:31.341 region:rollup2
TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND.

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:32.642 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE AND HOW IT HAS SO

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.977 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO IT

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:36.580 region:rollup2
AS AS AS IT RELATES TO THIS

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:38.215 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. CERTAINLY WE ARE

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:40.317 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW.

00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:42.953 region:rollup2
ALL UTILITY INDUSTRY IS GOING TO

00:58:40.317 --> 00:58:45.555 region:rollup2
BE IMPACTED ARE. CLEARLY OVER

00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:47.457 region:rollup2
STARTED ORIENTED OUR SESSION.

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:48.959 region:rollup2
AT IN THE LAST YEAR. IS WAS NOT

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:50.927 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE TOPIC THAT I

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:52.562 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO. HEARTACHE

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:53.830 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE ENERGY FORCE BUT TO

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:55.899 region:rollup2
NO PUN INTENDED.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.601 region:rollup2
BUT HERE WE ARE AND IT IS

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:58.769 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO FOCUS ON IT

00:58:57.601 --> 00:59:00.604 region:rollup2
AS YOU POINTED OUT TRY TO

00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:02.939 region:rollup2
EXPLORE BEST PRACTICES TRY TO

00:59:00.604 --> 00:59:04.708 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. WHAT THIS NEW REALITY

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:07.377 region:rollup2
MEANS TO CALIFORNIA? AS WE

00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:09.713 region:rollup2
CONTINUE INTO A DROUGHT YEAR

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:11.448 region:rollup2
AGAIN. AT A DROUGHT SEASON AND

00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
SO.

00:59:11.448 --> 00:59:14.618 region:rollup2
I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN ALL.

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:16.253 region:rollup2
THIS IS A TIME WHERE MEMBERS

00:59:14.618 --> 00:59:18.321 region:rollup2
WILL ASK QUESTIONS AND RESPOND

00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:21.591 region:rollup2
TO. OTHERS QUESTIONS IN YOUR

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:23.493 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION HOW WILL ALSO ONCE

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:25.462 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE HAS EXHAUSTED. ITS

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:27.597 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND HAD DIALOGUE WITH

00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:28.598 region:rollup2
YOU WILL SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:31.802 region:rollup2
FROM THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:32.402 region:rollup2
TO. OPPOSE A QUESTION AS WELL IF

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:33.703 region:rollup2
I COULD I'D LIKE TO JUST SORT

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.405 region:rollup2
OF.

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:38.575 region:rollup2
JUMP IN THERE IF I COULD AROUND

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:40.977 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF UTILITIES AND IT'S

00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:43.647 region:rollup2
BEEN REPORTED THAT.

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:44.848 region:rollup2
P. GENIE. HAS APPROXIMATELY

00:59:43.647 --> 00:59:45.949 region:rollup2
NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:59:49.486 --> 00:59:53.857 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. AND

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:56.827 region:rollup2
INSURANCE LIABILITY INSURANCE.

00:59:53.857 --> 00:59:59.162 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:59:56.827 --> 01:00:00.964 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO IMPACT ON.

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:03.800 region:rollup2
THE UTILITY HOW'S IT GOING TO.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:05.135 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE ELECTRIC.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.337 region:rollup2
SECTOR AND ALSO IN THE

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:09.706 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:10.874 region:rollup2
WILL WANT ME WORK BACKWARD FROM

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
MY.

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:14.711 region:rollup2
FAVORITE SUBJECT WHICH IS ALL

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:17.948 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:20.684 region:rollup2
SO WE USE UTILITIES IS A WAY TO

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:22.486 region:rollup2
FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY WE

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:24.654 region:rollup2
KIND OF GIVE THEM A.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:26.656 region:rollup2
A FRANCHISE

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:28.291 region:rollup2
AND DOES SAY YOU WON'T HAVE

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.993 region:rollup2
COMPETITION WITHIN THIS

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:33.230 region:rollup2
FRANCHISE AREA.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:35.499 region:rollup2
AND DIED MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:37.868 region:rollup2
THEN X. A JUSTIFY ALL YOUR

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:39.836 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES AND THE WAY THAT

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:42.272 region:rollup2
YOU RECOVER YEAR EXPENSES FROM

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:43.773 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS TO US AND WE DO THAT

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:46.009 region:rollup2
THROUGH WHAT KIND OF A TECHNICAL

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:48.211 region:rollup2
COURT LIKE THE ADMIRALTY COURTS

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:49.513 region:rollup2
USED TO. DIVIDE UP THE PRIZE

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:51.414 region:rollup2
MONEY FROM.

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:53.517 region:rollup2
FROM NAVAL BATTLES.

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:55.318 region:rollup2
AND IT'S LITIGATED IN ITS LONG

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:57.521 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND EVERYBODY HAS AN

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:59.389 region:rollup2
OPINION AND WE GIVE EVERYBODY A

01:00:57.521 --> 01:01:00.423 region:rollup2
SHOT AT HAVING THEIR SAY. AND

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:02.092 region:rollup2
CAN GET DRAWN OUT FOR A LONG

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:05.028 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:06.730 region:rollup2
WHEN NGUYEN UTILITIES GO OUT TO

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:08.431 region:rollup2
BORROW MONEY.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.167 region:rollup2
THEY GET CHEAP RATES

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:12.169 region:rollup2
THEY GET REALLY GOOD RATES

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:13.570 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.972 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN THE STATE OF

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:18.708 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FREE QUALITY BECAUSE.

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:20.443 region:rollup2
THE INVESTORS TO INVEST IN THEIR

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:22.646 region:rollup2
SHARES WHICH IS ONE METHOD OF

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:24.981 region:rollup2
FINANCING. KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:27.584 region:rollup2
GONNA GET A DIVIDEND.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:29.786 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY BORROW FROM BANKS

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:31.254 region:rollup2
USUALLY IN THE FORM OF BONDS

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:33.557 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THAT THOSE BONDS WILL

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:34.824 region:rollup2
GET PAID BACK BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:36.293 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED STREAM OF INCOME TO

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:38.428 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:41.164 region:rollup2
SO PEOPLE WERE WILLING TOLEND

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:43.600 region:rollup2
FAIRLY CHEAPLY THOSE.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:46.570 region:rollup2
DOES UTILITIES GO AND BUY THAT

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.271 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE UP FRONT.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.473 region:rollup2
AND COLLECT THE COSTS OVER

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A REMARKABLY SIMPLE

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:56.213 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO BUILD THAT

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.480 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:59.549 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.451 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE GRID FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.285 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO MODERNIZE THAT

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.287 region:rollup2
CREATED TO DEAL WITH NEW

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:06.256 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:09.159 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY SPEND A LOT OF MONEY

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:11.027 region:rollup2
TO MEET IN NEW. ON FIRE HAZARD

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
DUH AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:15.198 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:16.032 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY WANT IT YOU REALLY

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:18.201 region:rollup2
WANT TO BORROW THEM MONEY CHEAP.

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:20.303 region:rollup2
IF.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:24.341 region:rollup2
THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY STARTS

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:26.676 region:rollup2
TO FEEL LIKE PERHAPS IT'S RISKY.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:28.445 region:rollup2
TOLAND TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
THEN THEY CHARGE MORE MONEY.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:31.815 region:rollup2
WHICH GETS PASSED ALONG TO RATE

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:34.251 region:rollup2
PAYERS SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:36.686 region:rollup2
KINDS OF FIRE DAMAGES.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:38.221 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO INSURANCE AND THE

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.623 region:rollup2
MONEY IS GOING TO BE COMING FROM

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.124 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES TO PAY FOR THE

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:42.359 region:rollup2
DAMAGES.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.193 region:rollup2
I HOPE THEY START TO WONDER

01:02:42.359 --> 01:02:44.828 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:46.162 region:rollup2
PAID BACK.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:48.131 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE OF WRINKLES

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:49.966 region:rollup2
HERE AT ALL JUST TAKE COUPLE

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:51.868 region:rollup2
SECONDS TO TO TALK ABOUT BUT I

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:53.370 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT.

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.938 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT IT GETS HARDER TO

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:57.741 region:rollup2
FINANCE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:59.743 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE SYSTEM

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:02.412 region:rollup2
LIKE ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:04.848 region:rollup2
LIKE BATTERY STORAGE.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:07.250 region:rollup2
LIKE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IF IT

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
COSTS A LOT MORE MONEY TO BORROW

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:11.254 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:14.524 region:rollup2
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT'S A

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:16.526 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT THAT THAT I HOLD.

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:18.561 region:rollup2
SO THE REASONS WHY WE'RE SORT OF

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:21.264 region:rollup2
IN THIS BOX HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:23.767 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THE CPUC ACTS COLONEL

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:25.101 region:rollup2
LIKE A A COURT. AND WE FOLLOW

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:27.570 region:rollup2
THE LAW.

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:30.774 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LONG PROCESS.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:32.809 region:rollup2
WE AND THEY PREVIOUS.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:35.045 region:rollup2
.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.913 region:rollup2
SETTING MADE.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:38.248 region:rollup2
NOTE OF TWO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:40.283 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE CAME UP WITH WHEN

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:41.818 region:rollup2
WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:44.688 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN APPEALED.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:46.656 region:rollup2
AND AS THE JUDICIAL ACTOR AND

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:48.191 region:rollup2
HALF TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS TO

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:50.160 region:rollup2
DECIDE ON THAT APPEAL. BERMAN A

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:51.594 region:rollup2
STICK TO WHAT'S ALREADY IN THE

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.496 region:rollup2
PUBLIC RECORD AND TRYING NOT TO

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:54.030 region:rollup2
GET.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.599 region:rollup2
TO DEEP INTO WHAT HAPPENED

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.634 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:59.035 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN CERTAINLY ASK

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:00.537 region:rollup2
ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BROAD

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:06.276 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:07.243 region:rollup2
BUT TERM.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.678 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.413 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF INVERSE

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:12.182 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION TO UTILITIES AND

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:13.883 region:rollup2
ALL EVENTS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:15.452 region:rollup2
LOSS WOULD FAIL TO RECOGNIZE

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:17.554 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:18.922 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UTILITIES.

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:20.523 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:22.425 region:rollup2
ON UTILITIES FROM INVERSE

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:24.494 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION MAY LEAD TO HIGHER

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:25.895 region:rollup2
RATES FOR RATE PAYERS.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:27.330 region:rollup2
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.698 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY DEPEND ON CAPITAL

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.233 region:rollup2
MARKETS TO RAISE MONEY IN THE

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.768 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MARKET TO MITIGATE

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.970 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RISK IF STRICT

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:35.972 region:rollup2
LIABILITY IS IMPOSE FOR DAMAGE

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:38.241 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES CAUSED

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:39.676 region:rollup2
IN WHOLE OR PART BY A UTILITY

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:41.678 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:43.179 region:rollup2
THE RISK PROFILE THE INVESTOR

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:44.681 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITY MAY BE QUESTIONED

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:46.416 region:rollup2
BY INVESTORS AND INSURANCE

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:48.685 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ALIKE.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:50.487 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE OF AND COST OF

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:52.255 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND THEN SHE IN SPENCER

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.523 region:rollup2
SO SHE ADDED WITH INSURANCE

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
COULD LEAD TO THE HIGHER RATES

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.693 region:rollup2
FOR RATE PAYERS EVEN IN

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.027 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHERE THE INVESTOR

01:04:56.693 --> 01:05:00.230 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITY.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:03.466 region:rollup2
COMPLIED WITH THE AND AND I

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.666 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SAFETY STANDARD.

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.435 region:rollup2
CHAU.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:07.370 region:rollup2
.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:09.873 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE HIGH

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:11.641 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF PROOF THAT WE HAVE IN

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:13.376 region:rollup2
OUR PROCEEDINGS IT'S A PRUDENT

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:16.446 region:rollup2
SEE STANDARD.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:19.716 region:rollup2
IT PORT PUTS THE UTILITY AND THE

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:22.018 region:rollup2
POSITION OF HAVING TO PROVE.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:24.320 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE PRUDENT.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:27.257 region:rollup2
THAT THEY TOOK STEPS ABOVE AND

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.159 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT WE REQUIRE.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:31.528 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY WERE THOUGHTFUL

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:33.530 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY TOOK EVERY STEP

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:36.232 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE IN EVERY WAY OF GIVING%

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:38.101 region:rollup2
A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THAT.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:39.502 region:rollup2
I DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.037 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION THAT'S NOT STATUTE

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:42.439 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:44.541 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT IT WILL BE VERY

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:47.510 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US TO CHANGE

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:49.179 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CONSTANT LITIGATION.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:51.181 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THESE COULD BE RESOLVED

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
EITHER BY THE COURTS.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.951 region:rollup2
REFINING THEIR FINDING THAT

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:56.719 region:rollup2
CREATED THIS DEFINITION OF

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.654 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:59.088 region:rollup2
WHERE BY THE LEGISLATURE TAKING

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:01.724 region:rollup2
ACTION

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:04.861 region:rollup2
SO WE HAD SO WE CALLED FOR THAT?

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:06.629 region:rollup2
IN. AN ADDENDUM TO OUR DECISION

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:09.332 region:rollup2
TO COMMISSIONERS.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:11.468 region:rollup2
DISAGREED IN PART WITH THE

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND CALLED ON THE

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:15.138 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.106 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR MY

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:19.142 region:rollup2
KEY POINTS TO YOU IS THAT THERE

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:20.310 region:rollup2
IS RISK TO THE UTILITY IS TO

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.945 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO FINANCE

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.545 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MANAGER TO

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.214 region:rollup2
REPLENISH IT AND TO MODERNIZE

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.949 region:rollup2
IT.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:28.852 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:31.421 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE ARE STUCK

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.888 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR OUR PRECEDENT AND

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:34.290 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE COURT'S

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.427 region:rollup2
WE ARE OUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:39.028 region:rollup2
INVITE SOME DIRECTION FROM THE

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AS TO HOW WE CHANGE

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.931 region:rollup2
OUR PRACTICE.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.634 region:rollup2
WERE DIRECTION FROM THE

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:46.169 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO POTENTIALLY HAN

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:48.838 region:rollup2
HI CHANGED THE LAW THATTHE

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:50.540 region:rollup2
COURTS TO USING TO FIND THIS.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.208 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY TEST

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.210 region:rollup2
SO SORRY I'LL BE HAPPY TO

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:56.613 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN MORE BUT I'M TRYING TO

01:06:54.210 --> 01:07:02.051 region:rollup2
AVOID GETTING TOO DEEP INTO THE

01:06:56.613 --> 01:07:04.854 region:rollup2
TO THE SPECIFIC PROCEEDING.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:06.222 region:rollup2
APART QUIRK.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:08.791 region:rollup2
ON.

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:14.864 region:rollup2
ACTUAL ABILITY THAT WE HAVE.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:15.231 region:rollup2
TO WORK IN THIS AREA IS.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.767 region:rollup2
SO.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:19.769 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THAT

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:21.838 region:rollup2
IT'S ARTICLE ONE SECTION

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:24.507 region:rollup2
NINETEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:26.009 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION. WHICH ALLOWS FOR

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:30.146 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:32.849 region:rollup2
JUST TO DEFINE THAT. IT MEANS.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:36.352 region:rollup2
ARE IF A FIERY STEAMED BECAUSE

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:37.987 region:rollup2
BY SAY VEGETATION BEING BLOWN BY

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.988 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MILE AN HOUR WIND.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.957 region:rollup2
INTO A.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:43.426 region:rollup2
LIVE POWER LINE.

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:45.562 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.829 region:rollup2
UNDER COURT DECISIONS AND AGAIN%

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.463 region:rollup2
NOTHING AND AND JUST AN

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:49.599 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:51.301 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:53.937 region:rollup2
ARE THERE WILL BE.

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:55.438 region:rollup2
OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:57.206 region:rollup2
OF THE

01:07:55.438 --> 01:08:00.076 region:rollup2
I ENTITY.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:02.078 region:rollup2
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.846 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT DAMAGE REGARDLESS

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:05.615 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:08.685 region:rollup2
OR NOT SO HAVE I GOT THAT RIGHT

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:10.553 region:rollup2
SO FAR. THAT'S CORRECT THEY ARE

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:12.889 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED BY THE COURTS TO BE

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:14.624 region:rollup2
STRICTLY LIABLE SO IT MEANS THAT

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:16.592 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE PERSON THAT THAT

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:19.028 region:rollup2
PAYS IF THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:21.130 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT OF THE DAMAGE THEN

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:22.765 region:rollup2
THEY COVER THE WHOLE THING IF

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:25.168 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE PER.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:27.170 region:rollup2
WHO WAS FOUND TWO BE RESPONSIBLE

01:08:25.168 --> 01:08:28.905 region:rollup2
FOR THAT ONE PERCENT?

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.139 region:rollup2
THEY STILL THEY COVER THE WHOLE

01:08:28.905 --> 01:08:31.774 region:rollup2
THING EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:34.377 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE PERCENT.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:36.212 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND THEN

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:38.381 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT THEY DO IS RECOVER

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:40.550 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER PARTIES.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:43.419 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:46.089 region:rollup2
OF A FIRE THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:48.257 region:rollup2
CAUSED BY TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:51.194 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAME LOOSE.

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:53.363 region:rollup2
ARCTIC OVER ELECTRIC LINES

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:55.965 region:rollup2
CAUSES THEM TO FAULT BUT IT WAS

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:57.033 region:rollup2
THE THE THE TELECOMMUNICATION

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.167 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THE TOUCH THE

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:59.869 region:rollup2
GROUND.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS ON A ELECTRIC

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:04.140 region:rollup2
POOL.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:06.509 region:rollup2
HOME THEY WERE FOUND TO BE THE

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.910 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC COMPANY WAS FOUND TO BE

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.846 region:rollup2
A RESPONSIBLE PARTY THEY DID

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:11.314 region:rollup2
SETTLE.

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:13.182 region:rollup2
AND RECOVER SOME OF THOSE

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:15.084 region:rollup2
OVERALL COST SO IT'D MECHANISM

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:16.819 region:rollup2
FOR THE COURTS

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:18.621 region:rollup2
OF ACTUALLY FINDING AN

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:22.325 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUS WAY.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:23.659 region:rollup2
FOR ACTUALLY PAYING THE DAMAGES

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:24.627 region:rollup2
AND FOR BEGINNING TO ALLOW

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:26.562 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO REBUILD THEIR

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:28.965 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:30.400 region:rollup2
SO THAT I THINK IS THE IS THE

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:32.535 region:rollup2
THE POLICY BEHIND THE LEGAL

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.771 region:rollup2
THEORY.

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:36.639 region:rollup2
WELL BUT IT IS A LEGAL THEORY

01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:38.641 region:rollup2
THAT COMES FROM THE CONSTITUTION

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:41.544 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME.

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:44.047 region:rollup2
ARE THAT WE CAN CHANGE INVERSE

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:46.816 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION LAW ARE INVERSE

01:09:44.047 --> 01:09:48.384 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION PRACTICE.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:50.420 region:rollup2
NOW JUST THE FACT THAT THE

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:52.055 region:rollup2
UTILITY PAYS NOT WHETHER ITS THE

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.790 region:rollup2
STOCKHOLDERS TO THE RATE PAYERS

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:54.924 region:rollup2
GET INTO THAT LATER. BUT IT'S

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.726 region:rollup2
NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU CAN

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:58.695 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT WITHOUT A

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:01.130 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:02.999 region:rollup2
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT I CAN ONLY.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:05.034 region:rollup2
TELL YOU WHAT MY ATTORNEYS HAVE

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:07.270 region:rollup2
TOLD ME I'M NOT A LAWYER SOME

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.571 region:rollup2
WELL YOU THEIR BEST WISDOM AND

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.139 region:rollup2
IF FIRE IF YOU.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:11.874 region:rollup2
.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:12.875 region:rollup2
CARE DEBATE THEM I'M SURE I'M

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.577 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
AB THAT WOULD HAVE USEFUL TO ME

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.613 region:rollup2
TO TO UNDERSTAND OUR MY MY

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.115 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:21.084 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:22.485 region:rollup2
ARMED DOES ANYONE AND DOCTOR

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:24.887 region:rollup2
MELANAU SKI DO YOU HAVE.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:27.490 region:rollup2
OR DO ANY OF YOUR STAFF THAT

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:29.892 region:rollup2
ARE HERE. A MISTER PACKER HAVE

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:31.294 region:rollup2
ANY OPINIONS ON THIS THAT IT IS

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.328 region:rollup2
CA CONSTITUTE THE END FIRST

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:34.630 region:rollup2
CONTEST.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.998 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION COMES FROM

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.467 region:rollup2
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE E..

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:39.435 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I TO CAVE

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:41.804 region:rollup2
SHAKE IT TODAY WITHOUT THE

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:44.540 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF LAWYERS NOW.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:46.642 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO NOT AN ATTORNEY.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.411 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT WELL I THINK. AS I

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:50.813 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CASES AND SUCH.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:53.049 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.851 region:rollup2
WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT REALLY

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.819 region:rollup2
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION THE

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:59.155 region:rollup2
SECOND QUESTION IS.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:01.357 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE RATE PAYERS PAY FOR

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:04.460 region:rollup2
THAT OR WHETHER IT'S THE.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:06.629 region:rollup2
ARE YOU UTILITY STOCKHOLDERS.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:08.364 region:rollup2
ARE IF IT'S THE UTILITY STOCK

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:10.266 region:rollup2
HOLDERS OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:12.068 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE ABILITY OF THE

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:15.104 region:rollup2
UTILITY TO.

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:16.539 region:rollup2
BORROW AT GOOD RATES DISAPPEARS

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.541 region:rollup2
AND THE RATE PAYERS PAY ANYWAY.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:20.977 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:22.712 region:rollup2
BUT YEAH WHAT YOU'RE ALSO SAYING

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:26.282 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA VERIFY THIS.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:28.651 region:rollup2
IS THAT UNDER YOUR PROCEEDING.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:30.653 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PEOPLE

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:33.289 region:rollup2
PROVING THAT.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:34.857 region:rollup2
THE UTILITY IS AT FAULT BUT THE

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.792 region:rollup2
UTILITY PROVING THEY'RE NOT AT

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:38.161 region:rollup2
FAULT GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:40.163 region:rollup2
INNOCENT.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:42.098 region:rollup2
OKAY AND YOU'RE NODDING YES THAT

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:43.599 region:rollup2
WE WILL I MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:45.535 region:rollup2
THAT THAT UNDER THE PRUDENT SEE

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
STANDARD WE OPERATE UNDER THE

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:48.404 region:rollup2
NAPOLEONIC CODE NOT.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.439 region:rollup2
OKAY CHILDREN THAT COULD BE

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:52.241 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:54.343 region:rollup2
ARM BY.

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:56.813 region:rollup2
ARE BY LEGISLATION AS TO WHETHER

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:58.548 region:rollup2
IT'S THE RATE PAYERS OR THE.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:12:00.583 region:rollup2
I YOU TO THE OR THE UTILITY

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:02.084 region:rollup2
STOCKS THERE THINK IT ON A MORE

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:04.520 region:rollup2
NUANCED THAN THAN THAT AND YANK

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:07.723 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE THE TEST BY WHICH

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.059 region:rollup2
WE DECIDE THE DECREE.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:11.961 region:rollup2
OF INVOLVEMENT SO WHERE WAS THE

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:13.262 region:rollup2
THIRD THEY IN THE INVERSE

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:14.697 region:rollup2
COMBINATION WORKS OUT

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.165 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY FOR THE PUBLICLY

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:18.167 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:20.002 region:rollup2
SO PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:17.059 region:rollup2
COMBINATION WOULD FALL INTO THAT

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.461 region:rollup2
CATEGORY. I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.895 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE LIMITED ON THIS

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:21.564 region:rollup2
SUBJECT FOR TODAY I THINK WE'RE

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:22.865 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO IS SORT OF UNDER

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:25.167 region:rollup2
STORE UNDERSCORE.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:26.802 region:rollup2

UP BUT WE WITH THIS WILL NOT BE

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.849 region:rollup2
THEY'LL THE FIRST AND LAST

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.217 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WILL HAVE ON THIS

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:43.452 region:rollup2
TOPIC IN THE NEXT TIME WILL

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:44.654 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY. LOOK TO SPEND A

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:47.123 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AND MAYBE

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:49.525 region:rollup2
HAVE COUNSEL HERE. TO EXPLORE A

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:51.193 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE THE NUANCES THE.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:53.362 region:rollup2
.

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:54.697 region:rollup2
THE FULL RAMIFICATIONS OF

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:58.067 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WHAT

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:59.635 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS TO THE EXTENT OF.

01:13:58.067 --> 01:14:00.903 region:rollup2
HAVING NEW LEGISLATION THAT

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.838 region:rollup2
GIVES YOU DIFFERENT DIRECTION

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:04.507 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:05.808 region:rollup2
THE GOOD BAD AND UGLY OF THAT

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:07.143 region:rollup2
MIGHT REPRESENT AND I THINK

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.710 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST A WHOLE NOTHER

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.911 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:11.180 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:12.481 region:rollup2

EVEN IF THEY FOLLOWED ALL

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:45.781 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RULES AND

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:47.616 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES.

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:48.918 region:rollup2
AND IT EL.

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:50.419 region:rollup2
DEBT THAT THIS HAS LED TO ENSURE

ABILITY.

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:51.887 region:rollup2
IT HAS.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.489 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.789 region:rollup2
.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.458 region:rollup2
TURNED INTO.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:57.360 region:rollup2
.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:59.628 region:rollup2
AT LEAST FOR. PROBABLY AN

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:07.003 region:rollup2
.

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:08.671 region:rollup2
WE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT ONE

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:10.039 region:rollup2
I OWE YOU GIVEN A PREMIUM OF A

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:11.207 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.842 region:rollup2
FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:15.511 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WORTH OF COVERAGE.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:17.046 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT INSURANCE.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:18.347 region:rollup2
BJ IS BBB PLUS.

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:20.116 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:21.550 region:rollup2
BILLIONS

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:22.918 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS IN MARKET LOSSES

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:23.886 region:rollup2
EDISON TOOK A SIX

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.920 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.455 region:rollup2
HIT

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
RECENTLY.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:30.426 region:rollup2
.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.428 region:rollup2
AYE AM REALLY CONCERNED THAT IF

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:33.996 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:36.465 region:rollup2
TREND AND IF THIS ARC OF FACTS

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:37.366 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.702 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE HEADED TOWARD

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:41.237 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY PRIOR USE.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:43.005 region:rollup2
I REALLY THINK THIS IS A.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:45.708 region:rollup2
COMING.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:47.410 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:51.814 region:rollup2
THE CRISIS.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:53.816 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:55.718 region:rollup2
AND SO I MY FIRST QUESTION IS.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:58.854 region:rollup2
DO YOU CONCUR THAT THIS SET OF

01:15:55.718 --> 01:16:01.524 region:rollup2
FACTS CREATES A CRISIS.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:02.992 region:rollup2
SO AYE TH TH SHE A CONTINUUM OF

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS ON THE UTILITY

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:06.695 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THEY'RE

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:07.563 region:rollup2
GONNA FIND IT HARDER TO BORROW I

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:09.665 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:11.767 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IF INSURANCE

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:13.602 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE. THOSE ARE TWO OF

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:14.470 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS THAT I SEE AT A AT A

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:17.540 region:rollup2
MINIMUM.

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:19.708 region:rollup2
THEY MAY HAVE LIQUIDITY CRISES

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.744 region:rollup2
OF THEY MAY CHOOSE TO TO GO FOR

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:22.311 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY BUT I DON'T THINK

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.245 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CURRENTLY AT THAT

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:26.782 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:29.385 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CONCERNED.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:30.019 region:rollup2
COULD YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:31.821 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOOK AT THAT AND LOOK

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:32.822 region:rollup2
UP WE.

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:34.190 region:rollup2
AND I JUST THINK WE GOTTA BE

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:35.124 region:rollup2
PRETTY BLUNT PRETTY PRETTY

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.226 region:rollup2
DIRECT. HERE.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:38.627 region:rollup2
.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:40.830 region:rollup2
DOES THE P. UC THINK THIS

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:42.598 region:rollup2
WRITTEN RISES TO A LEVEL OF

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:45.101 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND ARE YOU GOING TO STEP

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.101 region:rollup2
IN AND DO SOME SERIOUS WORK ON

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:52.741 region:rollup2
.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:54.276 region:rollup2
A DON'T THE REGULATORY YOU HAVE.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:57.146 region:rollup2
OR OR OR DO WE JUST LET THIS

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:58.948 region:rollup2
UNFOLD.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.182 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.151 region:rollup2
HERE IS TAKING STEPS TO WHAT'S

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:03.085 region:rollup2
ON FALL THEY ASSUME THAT THAT'S

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.653 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS OR HAVING

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.455 region:rollup2
THIS CONVERSATION HERE TODAY IT

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:09.525 region:rollup2
IS TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. THE

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:11.827 region:rollup2
DIMENSIONS WATER THE APPROPRIATE

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:13.996 region:rollup2
THINGS DUE TO RESPOND. NOW WE'VE

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:15.498 region:rollup2
BEEN PRETTY AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:17.132 region:rollup2
OF BOTH.

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:20.369 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHAT WE DO TO

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:21.103 region:rollup2
MITIGATE THE RISK BY IMPROVING

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.805 region:rollup2
OF FIRE PREVENTION.

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:24.840 region:rollup2
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:26.575 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.945 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THESE KINDS

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:31.413 region:rollup2
OF CATASTROPHES. OUR. NOT SURE

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:33.015 region:rollup2
THAT THE ONLY KATANA KIND

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:35.050 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHE THAT WE ARE GOING TO

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:36.619 region:rollup2
SEE GET MORE SEVERE AND MORE

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.387 region:rollup2
FREQUENT IS FIRE.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:40.422 region:rollup2
HOME YOU KNOW TODAY CLEARLY IS

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.423 region:rollup2
NOT A FIRE RISK DAY IF ANYBODY

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.359 region:rollup2
CAME OUTSIDE THAT WE HAVE

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:44.660 region:rollup2
UNSEASONABLE HAIL STORM HERE IN

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:46.795 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE SOME MUD

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:51.167 region:rollup2
SLIDES IN THE COASTAL RANGE THAT

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:53.669 region:rollup2
HAS IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:54.737 region:rollup2
SO I I'M I YOU KNOW I SEE A LOT

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.539 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND NEED TO

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:58.641 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WERE WORKING AS HARD AS

01:17:56.539 --> 01:18:00.743 region:rollup2
WE CAN WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:02.478 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:04.013 region:rollup2
WITH THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. I

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:05.414 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.382 region:rollup2
ADOPTED RULES THAT MAKE IT VERY

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.783 region:rollup2
HARD FOR US TO HAVE

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:09.685 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:11.520 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS TO HAVE BOTH HERE

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.388 region:rollup2
THEIR IDEAS OR TO TELL THEM WHAT

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.557 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:15.624 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:17.293 region:rollup2
BE INTERESTED PARTIES ANY

.

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:25.367 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS DEBATE

AND THAT IN FACT THE REGULATORY

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:30.439 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES.

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.707 region:rollup2
THE RECOVERABILITY ISSUES THE

WE'RE GONNA BE AROUND HERE.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:43.151 region:rollup2
.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:43.886 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GOT SEVENTY PERCENT OF

THAT ELECTED OFFICIAL NAM FOR I

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:36.865 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW A LONG TIME IT SEEMS

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:38.333 region:rollup2
LIKE A SIXTEEN YEARS OR

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.401 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:41.136 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:42.838 region:rollup2
THINGS WE ALSO LIKE TO BLAME IT

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:45.140 region:rollup2
ON OTHER PEOPLE NAM BE INSTEAD

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:47.075 region:rollup2
OF I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.677 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:50.212 region:rollup2
COUNCIL WE BLAME THE COUNTY WE

01:25:48.677 --> 01:25:51.279 region:rollup2
BLAME THE STATE OF THE CHIEF OF

01:25:50.212 --> 01:25:52.848 region:rollup2
STAFF FOR.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:55.017 region:rollup2

BLAME THE CITIES AND THE STATE

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:57.452 region:rollup2
AND THEN I GOT HERE THE STATE WE

JUST LIKE WE SERVE THE PUBLIC IN

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:08.830 region:rollup2
AS THE VICE CHAIR SAID THERE

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:10.098 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT. OF THE OF THE

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:11.633 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:12.467 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS AND

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:14.569 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO.

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:17.205 region:rollup2
THAT CHAIRMAN ALSO TO GIVE A

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:18.940 region:rollup2
VERY. CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:20.742 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.244 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:23.779 region:rollup2
THEY ARE A FINANCIALLY

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:25.914 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY SOUNDS WITH BE VERY

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:27.215 region:rollup2
CAREFUL. OF OUR LANGUAGE IN THE

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.216 region:rollup2
WORDS THAT WE ARE WITH THE WE

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:29.284 region:rollup2
ARE SAYING.

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:31.319 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THE ONE QUESTION

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:32.788 region:rollup2
THAT I THAT I HAVE IS DO YOU

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:34.456 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A PARTNER A

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:35.490 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:37.426 region:rollup2
PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY BACK ON

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:38.493 region:rollup2
US. WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.995 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THERE SOME LEGAL

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:42.297 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS WE KNOW WHAT THE

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:44.266 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE IS BUT

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:45.300 region:rollup2
LOOK I'VE GOT THREE ACA'S I

01:26:44.266 --> 01:26:46.902 region:rollup2
THINK I'VE INTRODUCED THIS YEAR

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.769 region:rollup2
AND DOWN. IN EVERY OUT THERE

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:49.471 region:rollup2
GONNA GET THROUGH BUT WE HAVE

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:51.106 region:rollup2
THE CAPACITY IS LEGISLATORS TO

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:52.407 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TO TO FIX IT SO YOU

01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:54.476 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT A PARTNER

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:56.044 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU. IF IF YOU DON'T THEN

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:57.713 region:rollup2
LET'S LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.614 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:02.117 region:rollup2
I AM FEELING MUCH

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:04.720 region:rollup2
CLEARER THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:06.621 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THIS I I I I I WENT

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.657 region:rollup2
THROUGH A LONG FALLOW PERIOD

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:10.392 region:rollup2
AFTER MY KNEE SURGERY SITTING

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:12.394 region:rollup2
AROUND AND FRETTING ABOUT THIS

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:14.629 region:rollup2
AND NOT. NOT HAVING

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.031 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS WITH MEMBERS NOW

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:17.733 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE HAD SOME TIME TO GET

01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:19.434 region:rollup2
OUT AND TO TALK TO YOU AND

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:21.636 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HERE TODAY. I SEE

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:23.505 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE VERY STE MOTIVATED

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:25.574 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE LIMITS OF

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:28.043 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO. HERE EXPLORING

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.544 region:rollup2
THE THE NECESSITY OF YOUR OWN

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:30.412 region:rollup2
ACTION.

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:32.314 region:rollup2
HIGH A SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:34.049 region:rollup2
SHARPEN I KNOW THAT I SAW THAT.

01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:35.484 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IS

01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:37.452 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT SAME STANDARD

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:39.688 region:rollup2
AND POOR'S REPORT THAT I GOT

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:42.524 region:rollup2
TODAY. THEY DOWNGRADED THE

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:44.392 region:rollup2
CREDIT ON A SOLAR FACILITY IT'S

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:45.627 region:rollup2
A LARGE FULLER SOLAR FACILITY

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.094 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE STATE

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:48.196 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.531 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:52.234 region:rollup2
AND NON AND.

01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:54.736 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BACKYARD.

01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:57.072 region:rollup2
AND THEY DID IT BECAUSE THE CAT

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:58.807 region:rollup2
AND THE THE THE RATING AGENCIES

01:27:57.072 --> 01:28:01.476 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CASH

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:04.446 region:rollup2
FLOW FROM THE UTILITY.

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:06.748 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT ELECTRICITY.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:08.416 region:rollup2
THIS DID THIS IS WHAT IS BEHIND

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:10.519 region:rollup2
OUR SUCCESS IN TERMS OF

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:12.120 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES THE UTILITIES ARE BIG

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:14.122 region:rollup2
* CARRIERS THEY GET UP TO

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.024 region:rollup2
SPEED REALLY QUICKLY THEY GET

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.759 region:rollup2
CHEAP MONEY TO DO IT THEY ACT

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:19.494 region:rollup2
THEY CAN SCALE.

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:21.696 region:rollup2
AND IF IN FACT

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:25.033 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING THIS KIND OF

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:27.202 region:rollup2
REACTION FROM CAPITAL MARKETS TO

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:28.970 region:rollup2
A SOLAR FACILITY THAT'S ALREADY

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:32.274 region:rollup2
BEEN PRODUCING ELECTRICITY

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:33.942 region:rollup2
RELIABLY FOR PROBABLY SIX YEARS.

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:35.377 region:rollup2
A PROJECT I WORKED ON A LOT WHEN

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:36.945 region:rollup2
IT WAS A CITING PERMITTING

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:39.114 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTING LARGE RENEWABLE

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:39.981 region:rollup2
ENERGY PROJECTS.

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:41.416 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE PIECES

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:43.952 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT I REALLY

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:45.487 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT SO GOOD PROVIDES GOOD

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:47.055 region:rollup2
THINGS FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:49.057 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:50.892 region:rollup2
I WORRY ABOUT THAT

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:52.794 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THIS THIS THIS

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:54.296 region:rollup2
FINANCING MECHANISM IS STARTS TO

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:56.298 region:rollup2
FRAY.

01:28:54.296 --> 01:28:58.433 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT'S EQUALLY TRUE

01:28:56.298 --> 01:29:01.703 region:rollup2
OF OUR AB OUR ABILITY TO

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:04.639 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE TO TO DRIVE.

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:06.374 region:rollup2
TO MARKET SCALE AND TO COST

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.909 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS BATTERY STORAGE

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:09.978 region:rollup2
BATTERY STORAGE PRICES HAVE BEEN

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:11.379 region:rollup2
COMING DOWN. LARGELY BECAUSE

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:13.415 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:16.251 region:rollup2
BIGGEST INVESTORS YES REPAIR

01:29:13.415 --> 01:29:18.453 region:rollup2
COST FOR BEING EARLY. ON IN THIS

01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:20.188 region:rollup2
PROCESS BUT WITH THE BENEFIT IS

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:21.923 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE CREATED A LOT OF

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:24.593 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS WHO ACTUALLY CAN

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:26.194 region:rollup2
DELIVER. CHEAP RENEWABLE SOON

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:27.963 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE DEVELOPED WHICH CAN

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.931 region:rollup2
DELIVER CHEAP BATTERIES.

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:31.733 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT I ALSO FEAR

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:33.635 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:35.303 region:rollup2
EROSION OF CONFIDENCE IN

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:36.905 region:rollup2
INVESTORS THAT WE MAY FIND IT

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.506 region:rollup2
HARD TO FINANCE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:29:36.905 --> 01:29:40.242 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:42.444 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE ALL THE REASONS

01:29:40.242 --> 01:29:44.446 region:rollup2
THAT I FOCUS ON THE UTILITY IS

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:46.281 region:rollup2
NOT FOR THE UTILITY SAKE ALONE.

01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:47.682 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:49.251 region:rollup2
IT BRINGS ME BACK TO ALL THOSE

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:56.324 region:rollup2
INANIMATE OBJECTS THAT I FEEL

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:57.993 region:rollup2
LIKE I HAVE TO BE THE VOICE FOR.

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:59.761 region:rollup2
I THINK NOT TO I THINK REPEAT

01:29:57.993 --> 01:30:00.495 region:rollup2
WILL MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO IN

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:02.898 region:rollup2
PALM DESERT IS SAD.

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:04.199 region:rollup2
.

SIDE MEAN THEIR. APOLOGISTS

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.475 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THERE'S GONNA BE.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.975 region:rollup2

HARM.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.464 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY IS NOT SOMETHING

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:24.365 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LUXURY SOMETHING THAT

01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:26.201 region:rollup2
WE ARE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:28.002 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY AS.

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.759 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WERE COMING BACK

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:53.428 region:rollup2
LIVE ATTORNEYS AREN'T THEY'RE

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:54.729 region:rollup2
HERE TO PRESENT AS SOME OF WHAT

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:56.097 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE I THINK

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:57.532 region:rollup2
IT'S SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION YOU

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:59.467 region:rollup2
MAY BE HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR

01:33:57.532 --> 01:34:01.136 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IS THAT.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:02.437 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INVESTORS ARE WAITING

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:04.205 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS GETTING MORE

01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:06.040 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE NO MATTER WHAT OUR

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:07.575 region:rollup2
REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE HIT.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.776 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:10.078 region:rollup2
DAY THERE'S NOTHING WORSE FOR

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:11.312 region:rollup2
INVESTORS TO HEAR THAT WE'RE

01:34:10.078 --> 01:34:12.614 region:rollup2
GOING TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:14.149 region:rollup2
ROAD TO ANOTHER HEARING TO

01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:15.483 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HEARING TO ANOTHER

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:17.118 region:rollup2
HEARING I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:19.754 region:rollup2
THE THINGS ARE MOST AFRAID OF.

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:21.422 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT I'M HOPING THAT

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:22.724 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR AND THAT YOU HOPEFULLY

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:24.459 region:rollup2
IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WILL SIT

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:25.693 region:rollup2
DOWN WITH YOUR ATTORNEYS AND

01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:26.995 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE ALL GET TO BE PART

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:29.797 region:rollup2
OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:30.932 region:rollup2
RATHER MOVE QUICKER THAN SLOWER.

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:32.333 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A VERY BAD

01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:33.735 region:rollup2
REPUTATION WHETHER IT'S WITH

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.069 region:rollup2
INVESTORS ARE WITH OUR

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:36.971 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS THAT WE TAKE

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:38.439 region:rollup2
TOO LONG WE TAKE FOR EVER AND

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:40.575 region:rollup2
HERE WE NOW FIND OURSELVES AT

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:43.411 region:rollup2
YES BUT I WOULD CONSIDER CRISIS.

01:34:40.575 --> 01:34:45.613 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T PUT THE BLAME ON YOU

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:47.048 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:48.750 region:rollup2
ONLY LOOK AT SHARED RISK IRAQ

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:50.585 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY I THINK SOME OF

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:52.287 region:rollup2
THEIR ABOUT RELIABILITY IN THE

01:34:50.585 --> 01:34:53.521 region:rollup2
RISK HAS BEEN OUR OWN FAULT.

01:34:52.287 --> 01:34:54.956 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE REASON THESE FIRES

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:56.090 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SO BAD.

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:57.058 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:59.060 region:rollup2
DONE OUR FAIR SHARE.

01:34:57.058 --> 01:35:00.195 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.329 region:rollup2
LIKE I THINK I AGREE WITH MY

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:03.064 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AT THE BLAME GAME IS

01:35:01.329 --> 01:35:06.100 region:rollup2

MOVE. AND SO I IMPLORE YOU AND

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:10.672 region:rollup2
YOUR ATTORNEYS IF WE HAVE TO

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:10.939 region:rollup2
HAVE ANOTHER HEARING THAT IT

01:35:10.672 --> 01:35:12.106 region:rollup2
SOON. THAT

01:35:10.939 --> 01:35:13.975 region:rollup2
WHAT WHEN THEY COME HERE THEY

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:15.143 region:rollup2
COME HERE WITH SOLUTIONS AND

01:35:13.975 --> 01:35:16.411 region:rollup2
THEN WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I

01:35:15.143 --> 01:35:17.779 region:rollup2
WHEN WE COME BACK HERE WE COME

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:19.814 region:rollup2
BACK WITH SOME SOLUTIONS OF OUR

01:35:17.779 --> 01:35:21.950 region:rollup2
OWN. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MOVE

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:23.184 region:rollup2
THE BAR FORWARD ON THIS BECAUSE.

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:24.652 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE CAN CALL THE CRISIS

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.853 region:rollup2
ALL DAY LONG. AND WE CAN BE

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:27.355 region:rollup2
UPSET ABOUT IT ALL DAY LONG BUT

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.590 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY INVESTORS

INTO A PUBLIC CONVERSATION I'M

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:16.564 region:rollup2
JUST NOT SURE AT THIS POINT WHAT

01:37:15.096 --> 01:37:17.432 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE. RAMIFICATIONS WILL

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:20.068 region:rollup2

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:21.869 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:20.068 --> 01:37:23.404 region:rollup2
AS WAS POINTED OUT.

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:25.807 region:rollup2
A WHAT IS SAID FROM THIS.

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:28.209 region:rollup2
DIES.

01:37:25.807 --> 01:37:30.445 region:rollup2
HAS TREMENDOUS IMPACT.

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:31.512 region:rollup2
AND WE WANNA BE THOUGHTFUL.

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:32.814 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE SAY WE WANT TO BE

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:34.816 region:rollup2
CAREFUL.

01:37:32.814 --> 01:37:36.751 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE SAY.

01:37:34.816 --> 01:37:38.286 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE TAKES ANYTHING OF

01:37:36.751 --> 01:37:39.887 region:rollup2
WHAT SAID HERE TODAY OUT OF ANY

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.922 region:rollup2
KIND OF CONTACTS.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:42.323 region:rollup2
IT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:44.258 region:rollup2
MARKETS.

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:46.127 region:rollup2
WE'RE COGNIZANT OF THAT.

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:48.863 region:rollup2

01:37:46.127 --> 01:37:50.064 region:rollup2
FOR US TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:53.134 region:rollup2

BEEN SAID VERY CLEARLY TODAY.

01:37:53.134 --> 01:37:55.269 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN'T BE SO.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:57.271 region:rollup2

BECAUSE WHATEVER COMES OUT AS A

01:38:17.492 --> 01:38:21.229 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS GOING TO HAVE AN

01:38:19.127 --> 01:38:23.030 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS.

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:26.300 region:rollup2

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:26.834 region:rollup2
AND CREATE. A REPAIR PROBLEM.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.835 region:rollup2

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.155 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:35.990 region:rollup2
SPENT.

01:41:34.155 --> 01:41:38.392 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK BECAUSE

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:40.328 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN RAISED TO EXTENT.

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:42.430 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH THE SEPARATE CASE

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:45.433 region:rollup2
IN THREE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:46.934 region:rollup2
FIND OUT IF THEY SPENT THE MONEY

01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:47.468 region:rollup2
IN THIS LAST RATE CASE.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:51.405 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:53.507 region:rollup2
SPENT.

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:55.476 region:rollup2
AND I'M I'M SORRY I I THINK KIND

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:58.045 region:rollup2
IF DID MENTION OF WE HAVE A

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:58.679 region:rollup2
MINUTE TO EITHER MAKE THEM OUT

01:41:58.045 --> 01:41:59.080 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT WATCHES OR CHAIR OF THE

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.781 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.583 region:rollup2
IF I WOULD ASK THE.

BEFORE THESE FIRES.

01:42:09.357 --> 01:42:13.227 region:rollup2
IN ROUND NUMBERS I THINK THAT

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:14.595 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ZERO.

01:42:13.227 --> 01:42:16.330 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT THAT THE MISTER

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:18.299 region:rollup2

OF DISASTERS THAT OCCURRED AS A

01:43:20.528 --> 01:43:23.597 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THE FAILURE WOODEN

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:25.633 region:rollup2
POLES. HAD NUMBER OF

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:28.569 region:rollup2

PARTY TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:41.882 region:rollup2
THE EXPENDITURES THAT U. S.

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:44.452 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WAS

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:47.088 region:rollup2
MAKING IN THAT CASE THE.

01:43:44.452 --> 01:43:48.322 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:51.225 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:52.993 region:rollup2
MISTURA ON SORRY.

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MR WHICH WAS SPEAKING

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:57.465 region:rollup2
ABOUT. AND. OUR CHALLENGES AGAIN

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:58.666 region:rollup2
THERE WE'RE BOUND BY THOSE

01:43:57.465 --> 01:44:01.802 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE IN THE RECORD

01:43:58.666 --> 01:44:02.870 region:rollup2
AND SO OTHER COMMISSIONERS FOUND

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:04.305 region:rollup2
A OTHER ARGUMENTS VERY

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:05.106 region:rollup2
COMPELLING I DON'T THINK WE

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:07.708 region:rollup2
AGREED WITH.

01:44:05.106 --> 01:44:09.710 region:rollup2
WITH Q. ON THEIR ARGUMENTS I DO

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:11.946 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE VERY

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.080 region:rollup2
QUICKLY I WILL NOTE THAT ONE OF

01:44:11.946 --> 01:44:15.783 region:rollup2
THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.385 region:rollup2
BACKLOG IS THAT IN THE DOWN

01:44:15.783 --> 01:44:19.620 region:rollup2
ECONOMY OF TWO THOUSAND THROUGH

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:21.122 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE.

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.190 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE ON THE

01:44:21.122 --> 01:44:25.826 region:rollup2
PART OF UTILITIES.

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:27.828 region:rollup2
AND OF P. YOU SEE COMMISSIONERS

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:29.930 region:rollup2
TO VOTE FOR RATE INCREASES TO

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:31.265 region:rollup2
REPLACE WOODEN POLES I DISAGREE

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.867 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WERE MOVING MORE

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:34.635 region:rollup2
QUICKLY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY

01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:36.370 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO REPLACE ALL FOUR

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:38.305 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION POLES. IN A

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:39.306 region:rollup2
TIME CERTAIN.

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:41.509 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE SEEKING TO

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:43.177 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE THEM WERE SEEKING TO

01:44:41.509 --> 01:44:44.879 region:rollup2
GET BETTER INFORMATION ON WHAT

01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:46.614 region:rollup2
THE TRUE LIFE OF A POLL IS THEIR

01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:48.449 region:rollup2
OPINION RANGE FROM SEVENTY YEARS

01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:50.217 region:rollup2
DOWN TO FORTY YEARS. KNOWING

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.285 region:rollup2
COOPER COULD REALLY GIVE A

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:52.119 region:rollup2
STRONG EVIDENCE EXCEPT THE

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:54.155 region:rollup2
AVERAGE

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:55.756 region:rollup2
SO I THINK.

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:57.391 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH IT

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:59.793 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR SEA

01:44:57.391 --> 01:45:00.327 region:rollup2
URCHIN ANSWER IN A LITIGATED DUH

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.829 region:rollup2
SETTING TO THAT KIND OF A

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:03.664 region:rollup2
QUESTION

01:45:01.829 --> 01:45:05.366 region:rollup2
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE WE SPENT SOME

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:07.034 region:rollup2
TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS.

01:45:05.366 --> 01:45:08.235 region:rollup2
I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE A COPY OF

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:11.338 region:rollup2
OUR NATURAL HISTORY OF WOODEN

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:12.406 region:rollup2
POLES.

I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:17.444 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE SO

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:18.979 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT TO MEAN

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:20.548 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WOULD

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:22.416 region:rollup2
LIKE TO.

01:45:20.548 --> 01:45:24.351 region:rollup2
I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE

THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND.

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:39.667 region:rollup2
I WAS GOING TO ASK WHETHER YOU

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:41.502 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:44.305 region:rollup2
DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF THESE

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:46.207 region:rollup2
ISSUES ON. PLACES LIKE TOPAZ

01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:47.174 region:rollup2
SOLAR FARM. BUT FROM YOUR

01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:48.909 region:rollup2
COMMENTS EARLIER.

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:50.511 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S ON YOUR

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:52.112 region:rollup2
RADAR. WELL YEAH I THINK IS A

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:53.747 region:rollup2
GOOD THING BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:55.182 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKET

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:57.685 region:rollup2
IS A LINKAGE BETWEEN.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:46:00.087 region:rollup2
VIEWS OF I OR USE AND OTHER

01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:01.655 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE AND RELY

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:03.624 region:rollup2
ON I USE FOR PURCHASE.

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:05.626 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS

01:46:03.624 --> 01:46:07.661 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE BEING PULLED.

01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:09.363 region:rollup2
WHATEVER MOVEMENT.

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:11.165 region:rollup2
IS HAPPENING WITH I USE ITS

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:12.933 region:rollup2
POLLING A LOT OF OTHER.

01:46:11.165 --> 01:46:14.501 region:rollup2
MOONS INTO THE ORBIT.

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:18.172 region:rollup2
SO TO SPEAK AND.

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:19.707 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT RAISES BIG.

01:46:18.172 --> 01:46:20.407 region:rollup2
ISSUES PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:22.176 region:rollup2
THE.

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:24.111 region:rollup2
.

01:46:22.176 --> 01:46:26.413 region:rollup2
THE GOALS WE HAVE SET FORTH IN

01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:28.515 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW.

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:31.485 region:rollup2
A FOREIGN HAVE RENEWABLE.

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:32.753 region:rollup2
TARGETS AND REPLACEMENT OF THE

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:34.488 region:rollup2
LOST ENERGY PRODUCTION WENDY

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:35.356 region:rollup2
ABLE CAN IT CLOSES.

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:37.191 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW IS IN MY

01:46:35.356 --> 01:46:38.759 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:39.526 region:rollup2
SO JUST ANY AGAINST MY QUESTION

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:41.996 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:43.631 region:rollup2
.

01:46:41.996 --> 01:46:45.299 region:rollup2
WHAT AREAS BESIDES SO WHERE ARE

01:46:43.631 --> 01:46:47.668 region:rollup2
WE SEEING THESE EFFECTS IN OUR?

01:46:45.299 --> 01:46:49.303 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:46:47.668 --> 01:46:51.639 region:rollup2
ARE YOU IS THERE ANYTHING

01:46:49.303 --> 01:46:53.374 region:rollup2
CONCRETE THAT YOU NEED US TO DO.

01:46:51.639 --> 01:46:56.243 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

01:46:53.374 --> 01:46:58.012 region:rollup2
TO HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:59.513 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS CONTINUING DIALOGUE

01:46:58.012 --> 01:47:01.482 region:rollup2
AS TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:03.284 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS TO BE THE APPROPRIATE

01:47:01.482 --> 01:47:05.119 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT I

01:47:03.284 --> 01:47:07.187 region:rollup2
THINK THEY WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:09.523 region:rollup2
ABOUT PUBLICLY THEIR OVERALL

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:11.625 region:rollup2
CONCERN. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:13.494 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THE ANXIETY OF THE

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:15.362 region:rollup2
CAPITAL MARKETS BUT I THINK THEY

01:47:13.494 --> 01:47:17.631 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE THAT ACTIONS THE

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:19.099 region:rollup2
STATE IS ACTUALLY CONSIDERING.

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:21.068 region:rollup2
SINCE NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:22.503 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE CPU SEIZE CONTROL I

01:47:21.068 --> 01:47:25.606 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:27.241 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP. ON WITH EXACTLY WHAT

01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:29.810 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRS TALKING ABOUT WITCHES

01:47:27.241 --> 01:47:31.445 region:rollup2
SO I'M SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:33.280 region:rollup2
WHAT FEASIBLE WE CAN BE DONE. I

01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:35.082 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE WANT TO SERVE UP

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.583 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT LOOK GOOD.

01:47:35.082 --> 01:47:38.285 region:rollup2
BUT WHICH THEY DON'T THINK ARE

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:39.954 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO ACTUALLY BEAR OUT

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:41.722 region:rollup2
OVERTIME THEY WANT.

01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:42.890 region:rollup2
THEY WANT SOME FAIRLY CALM

01:47:41.722 --> 01:47:45.759 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:47.895 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE.

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:48.963 region:rollup2
IDEAS PUT ON THE TABLE I THINK

01:47:47.895 --> 01:47:52.366 region:rollup2
THAT WILL WILL RESTORE THEIR

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:54.168 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE AND BOTH OF THE THE

01:47:52.366 --> 01:47:56.971 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST POLICYMAKERS IN THE

01:47:54.168 --> 01:47:58.439 region:rollup2
STATE. AND THEN THE AGENCY THAT

01:47:56.971 --> 01:48:04.745 region:rollup2
EFFECTUATE YOUR POLICY THE CPU

01:47:58.439 --> 01:48:06.780 region:rollup2
SAY.

01:48:04.745 --> 01:48:07.781 region:rollup2

01:48:17.191 --> 01:48:21.862 region:rollup2
IT IS TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:23.831 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN. BE IN A POSITION

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:25.366 region:rollup2
TO GIVE WHAT YOU VAST FOR THE

01:48:23.831 --> 01:48:26.233 region:rollup2

THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT

01:48:30.204 --> 01:48:32.806 region:rollup2
PIECES THEIR TO THE KIND OF

01:48:31.839 --> 01:48:33.807 region:rollup2
DIRECTION THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:35.042 region:rollup2

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:37.478 region:rollup2

A MINUTE JUST TO COORDINATE.

01:48:37.478 --> 01:48:40.914 region:rollup2
HIS AS I SAY THIS IS NOT THE

01:48:38.946 --> 01:48:41.949 region:rollup2
ONLY COMMITTEE THAT HAS SOME

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:43.117 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF JURISDICTION OVER THIS

01:48:41.949 --> 01:48:44.318 region:rollup2

01:48:43.117 --> 01:48:45.619 region:rollup2
BE IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:48:44.318 --> 01:48:47.321 region:rollup2

FOR INVESTORS INVESTOR OWNED

01:48:51.225 --> 01:48:54.695 region:rollup2

PAYERS IN THE STATE. WE HAVE TO

01:48:54.695 --> 01:48:58.932 region:rollup2
