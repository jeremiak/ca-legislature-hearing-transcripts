OUTBREAKS THE THE FEVER --

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.299
UNFORTUNATELY ESTABLISHED IN THE

COMMUNITY SO KINDA ZEROING IN ON

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:38.851

SHE SURE THANK YOU FOR THE

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.898
QUESTION OUR AS WE SPOKE ABOUT

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.467
THIS MORNING SO MANY THINGS IN

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:55.835
THE PUBLIC HEALTH ROUND DON'T

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.169
KNOW A BOUNDARY.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.671
THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE COUNTY

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.873
BORDER THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.974
CITY BORDER.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.744
THEY EXTEND AND SO THE STATE HAS

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.213
A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE -- IN

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.249
WORKING WITH LOCAL COUNTY

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.817
LEADERSHIP AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:15.154
ARENA TO ENSURE THAT THE ISSUES

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.089
AT THE LOCAL LEVELARE MANAGED

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:20.726
AS WELL AND COME PROPERLY AS

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:21.794
POSSIBLE.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.963
THAT MEANS THAT BOTH TECHNICAL

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.632
ASSISTANCE RESOURCE SUPPORT AND

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.301
REALLY BEING A TOP PARTNER FOR

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.536
EXAMPLE -- WHEN DO WE DECLARE A

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.338
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OR WHAT

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.940
ARE THE STEPS THAT DEFINE THE

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.241
DECLARATION OF A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.108
EMERGENCY?

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.244
AND THEN ENSURING THAT AS WE

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.112
ACCOUNT FOR ONE HOW THINGS WE

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.148
KNOW HOW DISEASES SPREAD AN

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.983
OUTBREAK SPREAD BEING ABLE TO

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.218
WORK WITH COUNTY IS WHO ARE KIND

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.854
OF AT THE NEXT LINE OF CONCERN.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.356
SO THAT WERE AS PREPARED AS

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.058
POSSIBLE SO I THINK IS A VERY

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:53.793
IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE STATE

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.394
CAN PLAY AN PARTNERING WITH THE

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.296
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.465
MEET THAT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.200
NEED BUT THEN THIS BROADER STATE

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.201

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:06.405
QUESTIONS TO OF THIS CLOSE WITH

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.674
THE QUESTION IT GOES BACK TO

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.643
CHILDREN IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.913
TALK SOME ABOUT -- CHALLENGES OF

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.781
WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.183
PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC OF YOU SO

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:21.320
BE CITY PREVENTABLE DIABETES --

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.922
HAD A WE IS A STATE GET IN FRONT

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:27.193
OF THAT AS AS OPPOSED TO USING

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.028
OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.262
TREATING ILLNESS AND DISEASE.

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:32.798
HAD A WE GET TO THE FRONT END OF

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:36.402
PROMOTING HEALTH AND PREVENTION.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.137
SURE I THINK EIGHT EIGHT IF WE

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.272
DEPEND ON THE PHYSICIANS AND

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:41.974
CLINICIANS TO DO THAT WORK IT'S

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.743
TOO LATE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS BE

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.445
A COMMUNITY FOCUSED INITIATIVE.

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.214
DIED IN EXERCISE WE NOW ARE TWO

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.416
VERY KEY COMPONENTS -- WE HAVE

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.952
TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES WHERE

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.420
THERE MIGHT NOT BE GREAT ACCESS

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.188

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:04.497
BUT I THINK -- AS WE SORT OF

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:07.099
ENTER THE NEW FRONTIER BE MORE

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.901

PRIVILEGE OF WORKING AS A

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.688
PEDIATRICIAN IN THE FOSTER CARE

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:05.190

AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY IT IS --

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:26.044
IT'S LIKELY A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.113
HI I WANT TO START BY SAYING

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.480
THAT.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.249
THE WORK OF CHILD WELFARE

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:32.484
DEPARTMENTS THE SOCIAL WORKERS --

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:35.754
IT IS HARD WORK IT IS -- THERE

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.790
ARE THERE CHALLENGING STORIES

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.359
SOMETIMES THE STAFF DON'T HAVE

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.662
ALL OF THE SUPPORT AND UP TO

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.497
DATE TRAINING THAT WOULD BE

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.899
REQUIRED TO PICK.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:49.468
PICK UP EVERY ISSUE THAT A CHILD

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:50.736
MIGHT BE FACING I THINK THEY

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.871
OFTEN WORKING CONDITIONS WHERE

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:55.107
KIDS ARE MOVED AROUND WE TALK IN

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:57.376
THE DOCTOR IN THE MEDICINE WORLD

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:02.748
ABOUT CONTINUITY -- WE DON'T.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:03.715
SORT OF VALUE OR EMPHASIZED

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.484
CONTINUITY IN THE CHILD WELFARE

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.151
SYSTEM NEARLY ENOUGH.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.187
SINGLE KID WILL MAYBE HAVE THREE

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.688
OR FOUR DIFFERENT SOCIAL WORKERS

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.123
IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.958
THAT IN ITSELF ALLOWS YOU TO

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.726
DROP THE BALL SO THERE ARE IN

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.129
THE SYSTEM MANY OPPORTUNITIES.

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:20.165
TO DROPPING ISSUE AND IT'S REAL

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.801
PROBLEM AND I THINK IT COMES

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:26.205
AROUND OUR SYSTEMSTHAT.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.540
AND THESE THESE ARE PROGRAMS ARE

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.209
BASED ON WHETHER THOSE OF THE I.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.244
T. SYSTEMS OR THE TRAINING

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:34.947
PROGRAMS AND THEN IT ALSO COMES

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.448
DOWN TO SUPERVISION -- I KNOW

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.417
THAT THE REPORT YOU SHARED WITH

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:39.985
ME AND IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.120
THAT EVEN WHEN THE CASE CARRYING

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.990
THE CASELOADS OF THE INDIVIDUAL --

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:46.859
SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ADEQUATE

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:48.494
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.396
SUPPORT BECAUSE SUPERVISORS ARE

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.431
SPREAD TOO THING SO I THINK

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.866
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS AND

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.467
WE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.102
SERVICES AND OUR CHILD WELFARE

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.803
BRANCH.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.439
CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.841
THE COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:05.277
SOME OF THE VERY CLEAR AREAS OF

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.279
CONCERN ARE SHORED UP SO THAT WE

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.248
CAN AT LEAST SAID EVERYBODY UP

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.816
FOR THE OPTIMAL SUCCESS AND I

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:11.950
THINK THE AUDIT.

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:14.453
REFLECTS THAT AND MY SUSPICION

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.454
IS THAT THESE ARE

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.624
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD SERVE

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.192
THE ENTIRE STATE FAIRLY WELL.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:24.096

THE DATA ON FIVE FOSTER YOUTH.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.437
ONLY ONLY 4% -- GO ON TO

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.940
GRADUATE AND GET A GET A BA AND

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.108
TOO MANY ARE HOMELESS AND TOO

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:38.710
MANY OR ARE INCARCERATED.

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.546
AND AND COURSE IN IN MY CASE I

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:41.647
KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BEING FROM LA

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:42.881
COUNTY ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:45.050
FOSTER YOUTH IS IN I IN MY

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:45.817
DISTRICT.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:47.519
SO JUST CURIOUS YOUR YOUR

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:48.086
THOUGHTS IN THE PROGRAM AND

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.221
MAYBE A VISION MOVING FORWARD

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:51.790
THAT CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.192
ON ON THIS COMMUNITY THAT THE

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:57.129
NEEDS ALL THE HELP THAT WE CAN

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:58.564
PROVIDE THEM.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.731
YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SO

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.266
MANY OPPORTUNITIES I THINK COULD

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.101
OFTEN BECAUSE CHILD WELFARE

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:03.869
DEPART.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.071
DEPARTMENTS HAVE REALLY TWO

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.240
RELATED BUT DISTINCT MISSIONS

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.342
CHILD PROTECTION AND THEN

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.778
ENSURING KIDS IN THE FOSTER CARE

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:16.114
SYSTEM THRIVE -- AND AS WE THINK

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.383
ABOUT THE SECOND GROUP RIGHT

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.218
KIDS WHO ARE.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:21.653
IN FOSTER CARE OUT OF HOME

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.688
PLACEMENT I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.856
OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT A

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:27.526
MORE NORMALIZED CHILDHOOD -- THE

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.761
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THE

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.598
KIDS GET A CHANCE TO BE IN CHOIR

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.266
CODED DANCER BEYOND THAT SPORTS

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:37.002
TEAM WE SOMETIMES OVERLOOK THAT

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.637
CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.372
BECAUSE WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.641
TEST SOME OF THE OTHER BREAD AN

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.675
BUTTER ISSUES I WOULD LOVE TO

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:47.312
SEE US MOVE TOWARDS.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.381
THAT -- SUCCESS NOT JUST HEY DID

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:52.351
WE GET THEM SAFELY TO EIGHTEEN

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.019
OR TWENTY FOUR BUTWHAT DID IT

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.454
LOOK LIKE FOR THEM IN WHERE

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.289
WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE

00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:59.124
WE ALL KNOW THE STORY.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.194
OF THE CHILD IN IN THE SYSTEM

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.795
WHO MEETS THAT CULTURE THAT

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.764
CHOIR INSTRUCTOR WHO REALLY

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.532
PULLS A MOP AND SUPPORTS THEM.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.401
AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.969
FULFILL THAT VISION I THINK A

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.471
LITTLE BIT MORE HOLISTICALLY

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.172
THEM WE HAVE IS A SYSTEM AND I

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.741
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT.

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:19.778
THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPLORE WAYS

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.647
TO DO THAT.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:22.881
LIKE A LIKE A FOSTER YOUTH GRANT
