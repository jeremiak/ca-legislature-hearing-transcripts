OUTSTANDING CONCERNS I'M

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.270

BECAUSE WHILE THERE IS LANGUAGE

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.629
IN THERE THAT REQUIRES THE MOTOR

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.864

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.946

PRESENTING TO BILLS TODAY.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.890
S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR AND S.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:12.457
B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED WELCOME

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:22.834
SENATOR [inaudible]

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.436
CALLING SO.

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:27.205
THIS IS A A BILL TO FIGHT PAY

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.841
DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA.

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.409
WITH INFORMATION THE BECAUSE

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:32.811
WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:34.479
WOMEN AND MINORITIES.

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:35.781
WE SIMPLY CAN'T FIX WHAT WE

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:37.883
DON'T KNOW.

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:39.117
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW.

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:40.852
EQUAL PAY.

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.821
IS AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY CLOSE

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.422
TO MY HEART AND I WOULD SUSPECT

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.691
TO THE HEARTS OF EACH WOMAN IN

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.126
THIS ROOM AND THEN ALSO.

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:49.728
MEN WHO HAVE SPOUSES AND

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.429
PARTNERS AND SISTERS AND MOTHERS

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.632
WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FAIRLY.

00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:55.033
FOR THE WORK THEY DO BECAUSE OF

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.202
THEIR GENDER.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.503
THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WITH

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.305
UNEQUAL PAY IS THAT IT'S SO

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.507
OFTEN IS HIDDEN.

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.643
NOT CHOSE TO EMPLOYEES BUT OFTEN

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.778
TO EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WELL PAY

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:08.713
INEQUITY CONTINUES MOST

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.448
EMPLOYERS I BELIEVE. TO REALLY

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:12.017
NOT INTEND TO SHORT CHANGE THEIR

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.052
STAFF.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:14.953
AND RECOGNIZING THE PAY

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.055
DISCRIMINATION IS HARD TO DETECT

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.690
AND ADDRESS.

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:19.991
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:22.294
ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED REVISION TO

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.062
A DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.697
THE LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:27.165
SUBMITTING TO IT A TO THE

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:28.567
GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FIFTY

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.335
YEARS.

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.469
IT'S CALLED THE EMPLOYER

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:34.005
INFORMATION REPORT OR THE E. --

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:35.440
Y..

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:40.245
IT WILL A IT WAS A IT IN --

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.380
TWENTY FIFTEEN THE INTENT OF THE

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:44.683
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO INCLUDE

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.918
THE REPORTING OF PAY DATA BY

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.087
RACE AND GENDER.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.190
INTO THAT REPORT BEGINNING IN.

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:55.093
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IN AUGUST

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.627
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:56.661
ADMINISTRATION.

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:58.063
PUT A HALT TO THIS NEW RULE

00:24:58.129 --> 00:24:59.898
DEALING A BLOW TO THE FIGHT FOR

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:02.767
EQUAL PAY.

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.836
S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR AIMS TO

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:06.271
ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA COLLECTS

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.973
THIS IMPORTANT PAY DATA

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.975
EMPLOYERS WERE ALREADY POSED A

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.676
POISED AND PREPARED TO START

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:12.878
REPORTING.

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:14.446
EVEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:16.348
DOES NOT REQUIRED.

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.216
MODELED CLOSELY AFTER THE OBAMA

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:19.618
ORDER -- S.

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:21.119
B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.255
REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.991
EMPLOYEES OR MORE. TO SUBMIT A

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.260
PAID OUT A REPORT ANNUALLY TO

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:28.827
THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.495
RELATIONS.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:32.364
OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.100
HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:35.767
GENDER.

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:39.004
RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.572
NOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.807
WORKED ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR OVER

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.075
TWO YEARS WHICH STAKEHOLDERS

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:46.311
FROM ALL THE VARIOUS GROUPS.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.080
SO THIS IS NOT A HURRIED ALL OR

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:51.383
HAPHAZARD PROCESS.

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.018
THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE IS TWO

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:55.253
FOLD ONE TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.554
TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.256
PRACTICES.

00:25:58.323 --> 00:25:59.891
AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.192
PUT A MIRROR IN FRONT OF

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:04.129
YOURSELF AND SEE WHAT.

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:05.897
IS REFLECTED IN THAT MIRROR.

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.332
AND VERY FEW EMPLOYERS HAVE DONE

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.167
THAT.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.202
BUT WHEN THEY HAVE DONE THAT THE

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:12.470
PRIMARILY VOLUNTARILY.

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.072
MOST OF THEM HAVE DISCOVERED

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.540
THAT INDEED THERE ARE PAY

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:16.908
INEQUITIES THAT THEY WEREN'T

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.376
EVEN AWARE OFF.

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.878
AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE MOST

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.746
EMPLOYERS DO NOT WANT TO

00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:24.516
DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS --

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.751
PAY A ON THE BASIS OF GENDER

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.487
THEY HAVE CORRECTED THIS ISSUE.

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:30.655
THAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.557
PERFECT GOAL. TO ACHIEVE BY THIS

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.893
BILL BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS THE

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.961
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:38.029
RELATIONS TOGETHER IMPORTANT

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.831
DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:42.400
PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:43.635
AND IF THEY DIDN'T NOTICE

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:46.071
DEVIATIONS ARE OUT LIARS THEY

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.706
WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.607
INVESTIGATE FURTHER.

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:51.343
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BASED

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:53.378
UPON SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.246
THAT IS OUT THERE TO NOTE WHAT

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:57.349
THIS BILL IS NOT.

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:59.284
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:00.885
SHAMING.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:02.787
AND I HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:05.490
ENSURE THAT THIS IS VERY CLEAR.

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:07.258
IT WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.861
THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESS

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:11.396
TO THE PUBLIC NOR WILL IT

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.098
EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:13.698
FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.367
PUBLIC.

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:17.335
I'VE TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.337
PROHIBITING DISCLOSURE UNDER THE

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.171
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO ASSURE

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:21.773
THAT.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.641
THE LIMITATION ON PUBLIC

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.310
AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORTS IS

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:26.878
SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS AT THE

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.446
FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:30.548

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:43.528
OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION BUT

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.730
DOES NOT DO SO IN THE GRANULAR

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.766
WAY THAT COULD BE USED TO

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:50.468
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS.

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.238
THE INFORMATION IS NOT INTENDED

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.373
AND CANNOT BE USED TO ENFORCE

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.409
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT

00:27:57.475 --> 00:28:00.445
BECAUSE THAT ACT A A DOES ALLOW

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.346
FORD.

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:03.715
DIFFERENTIALS IN PAY BASED UPON

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.757
ITEMS THAT WOULD.

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:13.892
POSSIBLY GENERATED DIFFERENTIAL

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:16.327
IMPACT --

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:18.096
AND WE SOMETIMES REFER TO THEM

00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:20.231
AS BONA FIDE REASONS FOR PAYING

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.900
ONE EMPLOYER MORE THAN ANOTHER

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.802
THAT'S NOT ASK FOR A IN THIS

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.804
REPORT EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.439
EXPOSED IN THAT MANNER.

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:30.141
THIS BILL RATHER IS A TOOL TO

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.443
SHED LIGHT ON TRENDS AND THE BIG

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:32.944
PICTURE.

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.447
AND I WILL AND HAVE BEEN

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:37.248
CONSULTING WITH THE OPPOSITION.

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:38.016
I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL NEVER

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:39.584
COME TO A COMPLETE COMMON GROUND

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.619
BUT MY SENSE IS THAT THERE ARE

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.221
STILL THINGS WE CAN DO. TO

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.056
ASSURE THEM AND BE RESPONSIVE TO

00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:47.659
THEY MAY HAVE ABOUT WHAT THIS

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:50.061
BILL DOES NOT DO AND I'M MORE

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:50.995
THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.931
WITH THEM --

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:54.432
WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:55.967
FROM FOLKS REPRESENTING THE

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:58.403
TEMPORARY STAFFING UP OR AGENCY

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.004
REFERRAL SECTORS TO INCLUDE

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.873
EXEMPTIONS FOR THEM AND I AM

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.008
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.343
WITH THEM IN A BELIEVE A IT'S

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.978
JUST A QUESTION OF SETTLING ON

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.346
LANGUAGE OF FOR THAT.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.447
TERM.

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.616
RESULT AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.818
WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO SOMETHING

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.420
EVERYTHING WE CAN LIVE WITH EVEN

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.088
THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT LOVE EVERY

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.690
ELEMENT OF THIS BUT THE FACT OF

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:19.791
THE MATTER IS.

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.259
EQUAL PAY HAS BEEN THE LAW OF

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:23.128
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:23.962
SEVENTY YEARS.

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:25.830
GET RECENT STUDIES PREDICT WE

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.233
WILL NOT FULLY CLOSE THAT WAGE

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:31.169
GAP FOR A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:33.471
IF WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION. 40% OF

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:35.073
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE WOMEN AS THEIR

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.609
SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNERS.

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:39.410
SO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT WOMEN

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:41.346

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:42.687
WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY OR SOLE

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.288
BREADWINNER.

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:46.858
THIS MEANS EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION

00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:48.893
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.095
IN LOST WAGES TO CALIFORNIA

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.030
WOMEN SO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:54.866
WOMEN ARE WORKING ONE OR MORE

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:57.034
JOBS AND ARE STILL NEEDING A

00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:59.504
WHOLE ARRAY OF PUBLIC SERVICES.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.538
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING A

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.974
FAIR WAGE.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.041
WE'RE LOOKING THE STUDY SHOWS

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:06.444
ONLY ABOUT 6212% OF WEIGHT OF

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:09.046
THE WAGE GAP IS DUE TO ACTUAL

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:11.482
OUTRIGHT BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION.

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:12.817
SOME OF THIS IS HIS JOB

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.452
SEGREGATION.

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:17.088
SOME OF THIS IS NEGOTIATE WOMEN

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.456
TEND NOT TO NEGOTIATE.

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:21.659
AS HEAVILY AS MEN DO ON A EW'S

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.295
ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO TRAINING

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.663
TEN MILLION WOMEN ACROSS THE

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.566
UNITED STATES BY.

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:29.200
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO ON WHICH

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.935
NEGOTIATION OR SELLING GOSHI XIN

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:34.639
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE STUDY SHOW.

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.108
WOMEN OR NOT RECEIVED THE SAME

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:38.209
WAY WHEN WE CAN NEGOTIATE FOR

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.610
OURSELVES.

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:41.379
AS MEN ARE SO THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:43.047
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO.

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:45.049
A LOT OF THIS IS.

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:47.218
THERE'S JUST THE PERPETUATION OF

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:49.287
THE STATUS QUO CAN I'M I LIKEN

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:50.822
THIS TO STEPPING ON THE SCALE

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:51.789
COULD ONLY GO WE STEP ON THE

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.691
SCALE BUT IT'S HELPFUL TO BE

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.692
ABLE TO KNOW.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.127
BUDGET TO DO THAT --

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:58.062
ISN'T.

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.164
THINK OTHER PEOPLE AGREE ARM IN

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.532
ALSO HOW THE CAN HELP PERVASIVE

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.468
THIS IS THIS IS ALL WOMEN.

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:20.184
EVEN IN.

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:22.153
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

MAKE LESS THAN MALE NURSES.

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:31.996
SO WE NEED TO CLEAR THIS UP IN

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.865
TO HAPPEN AGAIN OTHER TOOLS ARE

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:57.822

NEXT STEP I'M AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.626

ABOUT PAY DISCRIMINATES

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.161
DISCRIMINATION IS ABOUT

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:05.630
OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AS WELL.

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:07.064
WE THINK THAT THIS ALLOWS

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:08.566
GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.034
EMPLOYERS TO DO THOSE PAY AUDITS

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.235

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.904
AT THEIR PAY DATA TO ENSURE THAT.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.005
NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE PAYING

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:14.972
THEIR WORKERS FAIRLY BUT THE

AND AND YES WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.179
WITH AUTHOR AND WE APPRECIATE

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.547
AND THE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:30.915
RESOLVE SOME OF THE MORE

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.216
TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE BILL.

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:33.618
AND IT JUST A FEW THINGS TO

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.585
CLARIFY --

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:37.555
FIRST FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING THE

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:38.623
EOC -- THE

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:41.492
FORM WAS NOT COMPLETELY DONE AT

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:42.927
THE TIME AND THAT IT WAS

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:44.095
SUSPENDED AT LEAST THE COMMENT

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.663
PERIOD AND THE CONSIDERATIONS

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.365
WERE STILL BEING OPEN AND IT WAS

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.466
SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.635
AMENDED TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE THAT

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:52.903
ALL OF THE VERY TECHNICAL ISSUES

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.772
REGARDING THE W. TWO BOX THAT

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:55.773
WAS USED FOR THE REPORTING

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.541
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE W. TO BOX

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.776
ONE THE SNAPSHOT PERIOD WOULD BE

00:37:58.843 --> 00:37:59.343
FROM.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:37:59.977
OCTOBER TO DECEMBER RATHER THAN

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:03.547
AS THE TIMBRE AND SO THOSE ARE

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:04.849
KIND OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:05.616
WERE STILL TAKING UP WITH THE

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.618
BILL AND WE THIS IS A JOB KILLER

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:08.452
FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.054
COMMERCE WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:10.821
TO THIS BILL.

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:12.456
AND BECAUSE WHILE THE AUTHOR'S

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:13.991
INTENT IS NOT THE PUBLIC SHAMING

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.326
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:16.827
STILL WILL BE TO PUBLIC SHAMING

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:17.795
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:18.863
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.665
HOUSING SHALL NOT MAKE FISH IT

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:21.632
IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL FOR THE

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.233
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:23.367
HOUSING TO MAKE.

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.670
THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC ARE I

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.972
MEAN YES TO MAKE IT AND BAD

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:28.205
PUBLIC.

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.707
PRIOR TO THE INSTITUTION OF

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:31.542
LITIGATION UNDER EITHER THE FAIR

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:32.777
PAY ACT OR THE GOVERNMENT CODE

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.712
SO ONCE A LITIGATION IS AND

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.313
COMMENCE THEN THE INFORMATION

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.281
COULD BE TURNED OVER BY THE

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:38.049
DEPARTMENT.

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.617
AND THAT IS A STRONG CONCERN FOR

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:41.352
US AND ADDITIONALLY OVERALL ARE

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.454
CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUE IS THAT

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.789
IT AGAIN LIKE THAT --

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.190
AUTHOR STATED THAT THIS DOES NOT

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.225
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE BONA

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.061
FIDE FACTORS SO WHILE IT'S

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:52.563
TAKING ITS LOOKING AT AGGREGATE

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.664
DATA FROM PLAYERS THERE'S NO

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:54.899
EMPLOYER THAT'S NOT GOING TO

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:56.734
HAVE A WAGE DISPARITY ON THESE

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:57.435
REPORTS.

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.502
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:00.237
UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY IS THE

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.739
CONCERN AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.140
THIS COMPANY IS NOW SEEN AS

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:04.775
SOMEONE WHO HAS UNLAWFUL WAGE

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.310
DISPARITY WHEN NOT MIGHT NOT BE

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:07.244
THE CASE THAT THE SITUATION

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:08.512
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:08.779
BUILDING.

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.381
GIVE A STAFFERS WORK FREE FOR

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:11.382
TWO WEEKS VERSUS STAFFER WHO'S

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:12.717
WORKED THREE FOR THIRTY YEARS

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.185
THOSE EFFORTS ARE GONNA BE MOST

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:15.386
LIKELY AND AT THE SAME JOB TITLE

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.722
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:17.922
HAVE.

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.356
ESSENTIALLY A SOME IN SOME

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:20.458
ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:21.792
INFORMATION WHILE THEY'RE BEING

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:22.927
PAID SEPARATELY YOU'D HAVE TO

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.428
COMPARE THAT INDIVIDUAL TO EVERY

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:25.763
OTHER STAFFER AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.131
TO COMPARE IT THEM TO EACH OTHER.

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.166
SO IT'S JUST NOT A FEASIBLE WAY

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.367
FOR THE EMPLOYER TO DO THAT

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:32.169
UNDER THIS ITEM BILL AND SO

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.204
THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.971
BE THAT THE PUBLIC SHAMING

WERE STILL OPPOSED --

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:21.865
I VERY MUCH THINK THE COMPANY

SHOULD BE SHAMED AND THAT'S WHY

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:24.902
I THINK THIS DOESN'T GO FAR

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.470
ENOUGH --

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:28.038
IT'S CLEAR.

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.974
IT'S CLEAR THAT WHEN WE ALLOW

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.209
THE MARKET TO WORK PUBLICLY AND

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.811
OPENLY FORT.

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.145
THE COMPANIES HAVE TO REPORT IF

THEY HAD REPORT PUBLICLY THAT

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.682
THEY'D BE MORE LIKELY TO EXAMINE

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:39.950
THEIR OWN DATA AND DO SOMETHING

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.919
ABOUT IT.

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:45.122

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:52.062
FUTURE TO BRING IT TO A FULL

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.263

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.932

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.731
FOR COMPANIES TO BE ABLE.

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.032

AYE BECAUSE EVEN FOR ALL THESE

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.336
FACTORS THAT ARE LISTED THAT MAY

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:12.703
NOT.

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:13.704
BE ME NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.239
REALITY IS WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:16.540
YOU COUNT FOR EVERYTHING THEY'RE

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.208
STILL MAJOR DISPARITY.

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.977
OF WITH WOMEN AND MEN IN TERMS

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.044
OF PAY.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.746
AND WE KNOW THAT'S THE CASE THEN

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.547
WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE WE

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.649
DIDN'T TRY DO SOMETHING SERIOUS

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:26.884
ABOUT IT --

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.418
I THINK THAT EMPLOYERS ARE

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.887
SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THIS

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.156
PROBLEM WILL LIKE TO SEE THAT

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:32.890
DATA --

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.691
THEY'VE HOPEFULLY HAVE ALREADY

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.426
DONE IT ON THEIR OWN.

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:39.062
ANALYSIS BUT THE CASE IT MAY BE

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.597
THAT MANY HAVE AN AND SO THIS

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.966
FORCES THE ISSUE --

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:44.368
AND REQUIRES UNDERTAKE ó A

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:46.036
GOOD HARD LOOK AT THEIR OWN

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:48.005
PRACTICES AND WHAT THEY CAN DO

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.306
BETTER AND THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:51.275
MATTER OF OF A RELEASE ON A

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.709
MATTER OF SAYING WELL THIS IS A

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:53.610
GOOD COMPANY VERSUS BACK UNDER

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:54.811
THE REALITIES ARE SOCIETIES AT

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:55.646
THIS PROBLEM.

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.181
IT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THE WAY

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:58.415
YOU GET RID OF SYSTEMIC ISSUES

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.984
IS TAKING A SYSTEMIC LOOK A DEEP

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.452
DIVE INTO THE NUMBERS A DEEP

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.887
DIVE INTO THE DATA.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.222
FROM THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:06.623
HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT THEN YOU CAN

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.358
MEASURE OVER TIME TO SEE IF

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.826
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:11.795
ON THAT SYSTEMIC ISSUE.

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:12.663
BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN WILLING TO

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.731
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS WERE NOT

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.033
WILLING TO LOOK AT OURSELVES

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:16.934
THEN BRING KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.903
SYSTEM IS JUST FINE AND I CAN

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.370
NOT A KNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:22.472
THANK YOU.

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:23.340
HE SAID MEMBER KALRA MISTER VICE

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:25.742
CHAIR.

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.177

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.845
BRINGING THIS AND AND I JUST

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.147
WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT IN

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.949
HINDA.

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:32.516
IS FAST IN THAT WE'RE GOING

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:33.784
AFTER FOR BUSINESSES PRIVATE

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.552
BUSINESSES.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.387
WHEN WE HAVE?

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.021
THE WAGE ISSUE WITHIN THE STONE

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:39.923
BUILDING [inaudible]

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.859
BETWEEN PARTIES.

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:43.760
MATTER WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT

00:47:43.827 --> 00:47:45.229
PARTY THAT YOU FILL IT WITH.

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.864
DICTATE YOUR PAY.

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:48.999
AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE US IF

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.734
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.636
THAT WE INFLICT ON PRIVATE

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.071
BUSINESSES AND MAKE AYE AND I

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.672
CAN'T SUPPORT IS.

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.107
TO I THINK WE TAKE ONCE AGAIN AN

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:59.142
INTERNAL LOOK AT THIS BUILDING.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:47:59.776
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUES

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:05.549
RIGHT HERE.

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.650
ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.285
QUESTIONS COMMENTS --

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:10.621
THE BILL HAS A MOTION IS OUR

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:11.154
SECOND.

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.290
THOSE BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED --

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.758
I'M SENATOR WOULD LIKE CLOSE

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.593
THANK YOU YES UP I DON'T

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.729
CONSIDER THIS AN INFLICTION --

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.230
WHETHER WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN THIS

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:21.598
BILL I DON'T THINK ANY OF US

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:22.833
DISAGREE WITH THAT HOW WE'RE

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.268
TRYING TO FIX SOME OF THEM --

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.802
WE SHOULD BE FIXING.

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:28.038
OF ALL OF THEM A GOVERNMENT JOBS

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.641
THOUGH OR PUBLIC --

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.609
AND THE INFORMATION --

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:35.112
IS AVAILABLE THE IT NOT THE CASE

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:38.015
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SO --

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.916
I I I THINK THERE'S A VERY

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:42.052
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO TO BE

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:42.886
DRAWN.

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:46.290
A IT IS FAR SAID IS CONCERNED --

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:48.158
AND I WANT --

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:49.626
TO AT RESPOND IF I MAY TO IT

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:50.727
ASSEMBLY MEMBER A GONZALEZ

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.896
FLETCHER --

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.798
WHEN I HEAR YOU TALKING I THINK

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:55.365
TO MYSELF NO GOOD DEED GOES

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.567
UNPUNISHED?

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:59.102
BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHERE WE HEARD

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.204
YOUR BILL AND I SUPPORTED IT --

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:04.007
IT WAS PRETTY OUT THERE AND AND

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:04.808
FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU'VE

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:05.942
MENTIONED TODAY I THINK THAT

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:07.611
MAKES SENSE.

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.379
BUT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT THAT

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.348
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO GET. TO

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.849
THE SAME RESULT WITHOUT DOING

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:14.785
QUITE IS DRAMATICALLY AND THAT'S

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.887
THE BILL I BROUGHT THIS YEAR AND

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.955
IT'S STILL A JOB KILLER BILL WHY

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.257
WELL BECAUSE HE'S COMPANIES

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:21.124
DON'T WANT.

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.225
TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.794
AVAILABLE.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.128
IT'S LIKE WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.830
THEY DON'T WANNA CHECK THEY

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.798
DON'T THEY DON'T WANT THIS

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.900
DISCRIMINATION BUT THEY'RE NOT

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.501
PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:32.369
AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU DON'T

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:33.537
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOTHING

00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:35.238
CHANGES.

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:37.808
SO THIS IS A BILL.

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.509
THAT THAT LOOKS AT HER FROM THE

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.178
NOT THE GRANULAR LEVEL THE

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:42.612
NOTION OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:43.714
KEEP HEARING FROM THE CHAMBER

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.115
KEY PRE READING MY BILL AND SAY

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.016
HOW.

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:48.151
CAN YOU POSSIBLY INTERPRETED TO

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.553
SAY WE'RE GONNA OUT YOU.

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:51.088
HOW CAN YOU INTERPRET IT TO SAY

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.622
THAT THIS ISN'T --

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:54.591
THAT THAT THIS IS UNFAIR BECAUSE

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:57.494
IT'S A AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE A PAY

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.396
DISPARITIES IT'S GOING TO LUMP

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:01.631
EVERYBODY TOGETHER IT DOES NOT.

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:04.501
IT PUTS THEM INTO CATEGORIES.

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.470
NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT CATEGORIES

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.004
AND IF THERE IS AS WE KEEP

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.573
TALKING ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.775
SEGREGATION WHICH WE ALL KNOW

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.810
EXISTS IF FORCES COMPANIES TO

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.712
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.881

LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND THEY

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.246

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:59.222
HAMMER COMES DOWN.

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.624

ECONOMIC ISSUE AND A FAIRNESS

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE WHEN WE

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.398

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.600
OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WE ALL ARE

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.235
FAIRLY WELL AWARE AS PART OF THE

COME FORWARD.

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.677
TO SUPPOSE THE PREVALENCE OF

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:35.645
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN WORKPLACES

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:38.315
IN INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.083

BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AFTER

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:45.989
DECADES OF ABUSE AND HARASSMENT.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.290
WE'VE SEEN HOW DEVASTATING

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.259
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS TO VICTIMS

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:50.627
TO THEIR CAREERS AND TO THEIR

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:52.395
EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND WE'VE

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:54.197
ALSO LEARNED HOW CHALLENGING IT

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:55.865
IS TO PREVENT.

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:59.002
AND STOP THIS BEHAVIOR BECAUSE

00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.903
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ABOUT

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:00.203

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.938

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.499
ENTITLED TO IN THE WORKPLACE AND

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:31.935
ELSEWHERE SO THIS IS INDEED A

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.670
WORKPLACE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.105
NOW BACK IN THE EARLY SPRING I

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:36.740
HELP TO HEARINGS AS THE CHAIR OF

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:38.174
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.509

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:40.577
COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORKING

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:41.611
FAMILIES.

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:42.846
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD TO DO

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:44.781
ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:49.185
REAL AN ENDURING WAYS IT BECAME

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:50.720
SINGLE MAGIC BULLET TO THIS

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.621
PROBLEM.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.390
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CHANGES

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.958
THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND MADE

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.493
NOW.

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.994
SO THIS BILL RESPONSE TO THAT

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.462
CHALLENGE WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:01.064
SET OF CHANGES TO THE FAIR

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.632
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT.

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:05.068
IN BROAD STROKES THOSE REFORMS

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.736
MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS CLOSING

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.505
LOOPHOLES IN EXISTING HARASSMENT

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:10.473
LAW STRENGTHENING SEXUAL

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.741
HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.143
REQUIREMENTS.

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.744
AND CRACKING DOWN ON THE USE OF

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:16.346
CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS WHICH

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.682
PREVENT VICTIMS FROM SPEAKING

00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:20.383
OUT AND SHIELD SENIOR OF

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.719
SHIELDING SERIAL HARASSERS

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.154
AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.288
SO THE KEY HIGHLIGHTS TO THE

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.057
BILL ARE.

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.158
ONE THIS MEASURE PROVIDES

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:29.659
GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS ON THE

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.394
SEVERE AND PERVASIVE LEGAL

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:33.363
STANDARD AND I WILL SAY I WILL

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.130
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A HIGH

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.932
STANDARD.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.267
BUT IT WAS CLEAR FROM BOTH THE

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:38.968
PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE SIDE THAT

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:41.504
WITH SOME TWEAKING THIS STANDARD

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.473
DOES WORK AND IS WORKABLE

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:43.773
[inaudible]

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.208
AND SO

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.610
WHAT WE CASUALLY MIGHT LABEL

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.212
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN EVERYDAY

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.247
LIFE IS ACTUALLY FAR DIFFERENT

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:53.049
THAN THE NARROW IMPRECISE LEGAL

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.852
DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT?

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:56.419
BUT ACCORDING TO THAT LEGAL

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.988
STANDARD THE CONDUCT MUST BE

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.590
UNWELCOME IT MUST BE

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.325
DISCRIMINATORY AND IT MUST MEET

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:04.561
THE LEVEL OF BECOMING SEVERE OR

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:07.097
PERVASIVE WHICH IS A HIGH BAR.

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.631
AND FRANKLY HAS TOO OFTEN BECOE

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:11.000
A WAY OF EXCUSING OUTRAGEOUS

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:12.969
BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF A WAY TO

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.637
LIFT UP VICTIMS AND HOLD

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.406
PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE.

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.241
SO WE SIT WE PRESERVE THAT

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.243
STANDARD FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.178
HARASSMENT BUT WE PROVIDE KEY

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:24.247
GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS.

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.949
ENCOURAGING THEM TO APPLY THE

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.817
LAW IN A WAY THAT FOCUSES ON

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:29.452
WORKPLACE FAIRNESS FIRST AND

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:32.255
FOREMOST. TO THIS IN THE BILL

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:34.991
INCENTIVIZE IS EMPLOYERS TO

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.427
INTERVENE EARLY. TO PREVENT

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.429
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FROM

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.431
ESCALATING TO THAT SEVERE AND

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.799
PERVASIVE STANDARD WHICH WOULD

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:45.101
THEN SUBJECT THEM TO LITIGATION

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.070
UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN PEOPLE

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.805
MOSTLY THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.140
WOMEN ARE DEALING WITH

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:52.575
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AT WORK.

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.244
TOO OFTEN THEIR ONLY REAL CHOICE

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.411
IS TO SUCK IT UP [inaudible]

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:57.914
ORDER QUIT.

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.349
AND WE KNOW IN TODAY'S WORLD HOW

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.684
DIFFICULT THAT IS WITH THE THE

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.553
THE FACT THAT OF WOMEN ARE IN

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.988
THE WORKPLACE TO SUPPORT THEIR

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.723
FAMILIES TO KEEP A ROOF OVER

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.424
THEIR HEADS TO FEED THEMSELVES

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.160
AND THEIR FAMILIES TO KEEP THEM

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.494
CLOSE TO BE ABLE.

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.695
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BASIC

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.831
NECESSITIES OF LIFE AND THIS

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.900
REALLY DOESN'T THAT IT ISN'T A A

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.334
REAL CHOICE.

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.603
IN MANY INSTANCES.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.305
SO THIS BILL.

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:23.773
OF WILL --

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.109

ACTION BEGINS THE MOMENT THEY

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:30.446
KNOW.

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:32.248
OF UNWELCOME INAPPROPRIATE

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:34.317
BEHAVIOR NOT JUST WHEN THAT

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.619
BEHAVIOR METASTASIZE IS INTO THE

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:38.588
KIND OF SEVERE PERVASIVE

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:39.322

ARE NOT ADEQUATE.

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:58.374
AND THAT IS TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:57:58.441 --> 00:58:00.143
THIS MEASURE WILL REQUIRE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:57.000
EXTRACT FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:57.367
HIM.

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:58.635
AND THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF HOW

00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:00.303
THE LAW SHOULD WORK SO THIS

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.405
MEASURE A MEASURE WILL RESTRICT

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.140
THE PRACTICE OF IMPOSING SILENCE

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.441
ON WORKERS.

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:06.776
THROUGH EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.111

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:10.079
AGREEMENT AND STOP EMPLOYERS

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:12.682
FROM UTILIZING SNEAKY RELEASES A

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.050
PRACTICE IN WHICH WORKERS SIGN

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:16.185
SOME PAPER TO GET POTENTIALLY A

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.687
LITTLE REYES FROM A SMALL BONUS

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.122
FOR A BIG BONUS.

00:59:19.188 --> 00:59:20.723
WITHOUT REALIZING THAT IN FACT

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.191
THEY SIGNED THEIR A ROOF RIGHT

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:25.228
AWAY TO SEEK JUSTICE.

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:26.062
THESE ARE THE ITEMS I THINK

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.697
THERE'S A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:28.798

THAT IS CORRECT WHAT'S ALL TOO

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.519

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:25.755
FROM THE RECENT ME TO MOVEMENT

IS THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.458
STILL VERY MUCH A PERVASIVE

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.693
PROBLEM INGRAINED IN THE CULTURE

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.195
OF OUR WORKPLACES.

I GET CALLS ALL THE TIME FROM

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.332
WORKERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.201
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE JOB.

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.402
THEY DESCRIBE HAVING TO DEAL

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.204
WITH CO WORKERS AND SUPERVISORS

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.406

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.176
PARTNERS.

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.878
IN ONE RECENT INSTANCE A WOMAN

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.413
DESCRIBED TO ME HOW HER CO

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.915

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.851
COURAGE IN HER TO GO OUT WITH

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.185
ANOTHER MAN AT THE OFFICE.

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.554
SHE REPEATEDLY REFUSED AND

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.923
ULTIMATELY WITH OTHER CO WORKER

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.291

SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS AND

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.597
WAS TERMINATED FROM HER POSITION.

01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:09.632
THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF WORK

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.768
EXPERIENCES THAT CALIFORNIANS

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.970
ARE ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO INDOOR.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.304
YET UNFORTUNATELY THESE

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.706
INCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING EVERY

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:19.175
DAY UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.311
EVERY KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.047
WOMEN FEEL LIKE THEY MUST

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.015
OVERCOME THE SEXUALLY HARASSING

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:29.118
CONDUCT AND SOLDIER ON THEY

OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD TO QUIT OR

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.088
TAKE TIME OFF.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.289
AND THEY CONTINUED TO WORK

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:36.192
DESPITE EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:38.194
TRAUMA AND ANXIETY.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.962
THEY SHOULD NEVER BE PENALIZED

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.431
IN THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.032
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.767
WORK HARD. TO SUPPORT THEIR

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.502
FAMILIES AND WERE PRODUCTIVE

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.171
EMPLOYEES DESPITE THE CONDUCT

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.039
THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO INDOOR.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:51.741
S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED WILL

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:52.842
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE FAILURES

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.078
AND INCONSISTENCIES BY THE COURT

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.813
BY PROVIDING STATUTORY GUIDANCE

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.381
ON WHAT SEVERE OR PERVASIVE

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.149
MEANS. FOR PURPOSES OF SEXUAL

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:02.318
HARASSMENT CLAIMS THE BILL WILL

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.820
CLARIFY THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.089
MEANS THE CONDUCT OBJECTIVELY

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.324
AND SUBJECTIVELY INTERFERED WITH

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.392
THE WORKERS ABILITY TO DO OUR

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.293
JOB.

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.461
A WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:13.930
SURVIVE HER WORKPLACE SHOULD BE

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:15.498
GIVEN AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.767
THRIVE IN IT.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.068
THIS BILL WILL ALSO STRENGTHENED

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.603
IN EMPLOYERS DUTY TO PREVENT

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.205
HARASSMENT BY MAKING CLEAR THAT

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.107
THE DUTY START AS SOON AS THE

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.209
EMPLOYER IS AWARE THAT THERE IS

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.376
UNWELCOME CONDUCT [inaudible]

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.212
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:30.580
I HEARD FROM A POTENTIAL CLIENT

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.148
RECENTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT A CO

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.951
WORKERS USE OF A WHITE BOARD.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.553
DEPICT SEXUAL MATERIAL POSITIONS

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.555
EXETER.

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.623
THE EMPLOYER INTERVIEW THE

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.492
COMPLAINANT.

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:43.626
BUT THE EMPLOYER DETERMINE THAT

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.795
THIS INCIDENT DID NOT RISE TO

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.497
THE LEVEL OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:48.631
AND THEREFORE TOOK NO FURTHER

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.533
ACTION.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.468
THIS KIND OF DECISION ENCOURAGES

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.237
THE PERPETRATOR TO CONTINUE THIS

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.139
KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND EVENTUALLY

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.373
TO ESCALATED.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.609
IT ALSO DISCOURAGES EMPLOYEES

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.544
FROM COMPLAINING ABOUT.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.345
BEHAVIOR AND CONDUCT THAT THEY

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:05.248
EXPERIENCE S. B. THIRTEEN

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:05.882
HUNDRED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.017
THE EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY TO STOP

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.752
THIS BEHAVIOR FROM THE BEGINNING.

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.454
RATHER THAN ALLOW INAPPROPRIATE

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.156
OR OFFENSIVE CON TO CONTINUE TO

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.557
THE SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.559
VICTIM BEFORE FINALLY ESCALATES

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.494
TO SEVERE PERVASIVE.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.996
ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT OF

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.330
THIS BILL IS BANNING THE LEGAL

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.699
TACTIC THAT EMPLOYERS INTERIOR

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.934
HARASSERS HAVE USED TO TRYING TO

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.370
GET AROUND ANTI HARASSMENT AND

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:29.105
ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS.

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.873
I'VE SEEN AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.575
SEEN MANY EMPLOYERS THAT REQUIRE

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.744
WORKERS TO SIGN VARIOUS LEGAL

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.012
DOCUMENTS AS A CONDITION OF

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.813
EMPLOYMENT AS A WAY TO SILENCE

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.816
VICTIMS ESCAPE LIABILITY.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.718
OR MINIMIZE PUBLIC SCRUTINY.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.420
IN CONCLUSION THIS BILL TAKES A

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.955
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.590
ADDRESSING SEX HARASSMENT AND

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.658
PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.326
STRENGTHENING OUR EXISTING LAWS

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:51.694
AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.496
AND ENSURING THAT THESE RIGHTS

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.965
CANNOT BE CONTRA CONTRACTED AWAY

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.533
BY DECEPTIVE LEGAL AGREEMENTS

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.501
AND FOR THAT I STRONGLY URGE

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.368
YOUR AYE [inaudible]

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:01.237

BILL WITH US --

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:21.897
BUT OUR CONCERNS REMAIN IN THAT.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.833
CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW AND AS

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.134
THE US THAT HAS SENATOR

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.402
MENTIONED THERE IS A SEVERE

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:27.870
PERVASIVE STANDARD AND WE SEE

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.472
THIS BILL AS A WAY AROUND THAT

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.673
SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD

01:08:30.739 --> 01:08:31.807
BECAUSE YOU NO LONGER ACTUALLY

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.209
PROVE THAT HAVE TO PROVE THE

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.376
ANYONE SUFFERED FROM HARASSMENT

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:35.478
OR DISCRIMINATION.

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:36.345
IN ORDER TO SUE YOU ONLY HAVE TO

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.515
PROVE THAT IT WAS A ANYONE.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.116
SUMMER AND EMPLOYEE A BY

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.952
STANDARD CAN BE ANYBODY AND THAT

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.153
IT WAS UNWELCOME TO YOU AND THAT

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.788
YOU AND NOTIFIED THE EMPLOYER SO

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:46.522
YOU WENT AHEAD AND TOLD THEM

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.556
THAT YOU FOUND AND WELCOME AND

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.824
THAT THEY FAILED TO TAKE ALL

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:49.825
REASONABLE STEPS.

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:50.860
IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.595
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION IF

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.196
IT WERE TO CONTINUE THEN IT

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:55.264
WOULD BECOME HARASSMENT

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.899
DISCRIMINATION NOT THAT IT IS

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.734
YET CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW THE

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.603
DF THE AGE HAS POLICE POWER AND

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:01.604
REGARDING PREVENTION OF

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.205
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.440
EMPLOYERS HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:05.608
DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT.

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.276
OR DISCRIMINATION ABED DE IF THE

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.044
H. CAN ENFORCE ANY SORT OF NON

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.579
MONETARY REMEDY AGAINST THOSE

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.114
EMPLOYERS THAT ARE NOT ARE THAT

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:12.848
ARE FAILING TO PREVENT

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.183
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.150
AND SO OUR CONCERN WITH THIS

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.219
BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.587
SOMEONE TO SUE FOR HYPOTHETICAL

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:19.922
NO ONE'S ACTUALLY SUFFERED

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:21.190
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:22.625
THAT YOU CAN BRING A LAWSUIT.

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:23.993
IF I WERE TO CONTINUE TO RUN

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.227
THROUGH THE RED LIGHT THEN I

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.529
WOULD GET A TICKET IF I STOPPED

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.696
AND I SHOULD NOT GET THE TICKET

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.031
AND THE DMV AGE HAS UP PLEASE

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.299
POWER TO ENFORCE THAT.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.500
AND THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.768
WITH THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.070
OTHER AND ISSUES THAT MISTER

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.405
MCNEALY WILL MENTION REGARDING

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:40.175
THE ADD NON DISPARAGEMENT

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:40.676
AGREEMENTS AND SEPARATE

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.545
AGREEMENTS.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:43.112
THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED.

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.446
OF VERY QUICKLY MISTER CHAIR IF

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.248
I COULD JUST A A SUBDIVISION QUE

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:50.085
FIRST THREE QUICK ITEMS --

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.154
THAT IS WHERE THE BILL IS

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.289
ATTEMPTING TO POVIDE KEY

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.657
GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS AND OUR

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:57.359
CONCERN IS THAT IT SUBSTANTIALLY.

01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:00.129
BY LOWERS THE BAR IN

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:00.429
[inaudible]

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.164
QUE -- TO

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:05.000
CAP A IT SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYER

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.869
KNEW THAT THE CONDUCT WAS

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.737
UNWELCOME TO THE PLAINTIFF.

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:10.673
AT WHAT POINT DID THE EMPLOYER

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:13.175
NO BECAUSE THE VICTIM INFORM THE

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.343
EMPLOYER THAT THEY HAD PRIOR

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.245
NOTICE.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.980
OF WHO IS THE PLAINTIFF IS THE

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.250
PLAINTIFF ACTUALLY THE VICTIM.

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:23.686
FOR A THIRD PARTY A BYSTANDER

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.254
FOR EXAMPLE WHO FOUND THE

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.356
CONDUCT WAS UNWELCOME TO HIM OR

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.725
TO HER.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.527
IN SUBDIVISION BE --

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.195
QUE TO BE.

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:35.531
IF IT INCREASED.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.066
SO THE WAY I READ THAT LANGUAGE

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.034
IS IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MEET

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:39.335
[inaudible]

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:40.836
THE STANDARD.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.606
BUT IT MIGHT IN THE FUTURE.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.641
AND I THINK MISS CURTIS'S --

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:48.777
ANALOGY TO RUNNING THE RED LIGHT.

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.312
A SEEMS APPLICABLE HERE IN OTHER

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.847
WORDS.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.016
IF I IT COULD BE THAT I RUN THE

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.218
RED LIGHT AND IF I DO I VIOLATED

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.253
THE LAW.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.189
BUT THIS ASSUMES THAT IT WILL

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.391
ACHIEVE THAT STATUS AND YET

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.726
DOESN'T REQUIRE IT.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.294
WHICH IS WHY IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.029
LOWERING OF THE BAR.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.998
IF IT IN SUBDIVISION BE IF IT

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.500
INCREASED IN SEVERITY OR PRE OR

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.569
BECAME PERVASIVE NOT THAT IT IS

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:14.737
WHICH IS THE LEGAL STANDARD

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.305
TODAY.

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.674
AND THEN IN A AND B. E. CAPS A

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.843
AND B. IT USES THE TERM OF ART

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:22.444
THE PHRASE THAT CONDUCT.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:24.780
AND NOW IN IN SUBDIVISION SEE IT

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:28.050
SAYS SAME OR SIMILAR CONDUCT AND

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.718
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.887
AND LASTLY I WOULD NOTE IN TWO

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.188
CAPS SEE.

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.991
ALL REASONABLE STEPS WHAT ARE

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:38.594
ALL OF THE REASONABLE STEPS.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.629
BUT YOU KNOW REASONABLE IS QUITE

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:43.332
NEBULOUS ITSELF BUT THEN ALL.

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:45.334
IF YOU DID ONE OR THREE OF THE

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.902
REASONABLE ITEMS IS THAT

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.237
SUFFICIENT TO STEM LIABILITY OR

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:49.938
NOT.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:52.775
IN SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL WE

WHICH JUST NOT READING THE SAME

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.453
PILL.

ARE IS A LAWYER AND WORKING WITH

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.390
LAWYERS THE INTERPRETATION THAT

WORD HEARING IS JUST NOT.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.929
ACCURATE CAUGHT UP BUT I AM MORE

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:09.631
THAN HAPPY WE HAVE TAKEN SOME

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.766
AMENDMENTS TO REINFORCE THE FACT

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.201
THAT YOU HAVE.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.903
TO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED TO HAVE

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.605
STANDING YOU CAN'T NOBODY IT'S

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:19.741
NOT JUST ANYBODY CAN SUE --

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:22.978
THE YEAH IF YOU REPORT A A TWO

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.879
HR THAT SOMEONE'S BEHAVING IN AN

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.982
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUALIZED MANNER

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.450
TOWARDS YOU IN THE WORKPLACE.

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:29.884
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT THE

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:32.187
HR TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:34.122
STOP THAT AND IN FACT THAT'S

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.757
WHAT THE BILL DOES IT SAYS.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.425
IF YOU.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.860
A HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THE

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.061
EXPERIENCE BEHAVIOR WHICH IS ON

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:42.530
WELCOMED IT'S NOT THAT THE

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.199
EMPLOYER SHOULDN'T ALL.

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:45.734
WE'VE MADE WE TIED IT UP IT'S

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.003
THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAS GONE TO

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.571
THE EMPLOYER.

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.940
SO EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE TO GUESS.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.575
THIS BILL SAYS THE EMPLOYER

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.010
KNOWS AND THE EMPLOYER'S GONNA

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.511
NOLL BECAUSE THEY KNOW BECAUSE

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:59.447
SOMEONE STOLE THEM.

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:00.949
SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE --

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:03.418
THE A EMPLOYEES CAN'T SUE FOR A

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:04.552
LITTLE THING THEY FIND

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.121
INAPPROPRIATE ARE UNWELCOME IN

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.823
THE WORKPLACE --

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.625
THAT I'D LIKE TO USE THE ANALOGY

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.394
THAT THE CHAMBER USED IF YOU RUN

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.928
A RED LIGHT.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:15.764
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO A CITATION

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.732
YOU VIOLATED THE LAW BUT IF YOU

01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:18.967
STOP BEFORE YOU GET TO THE RED

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.568
LIGHT.

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.070
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.338
AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF WHAT

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:25.307
THIS BILL IS THAT THAT IS TRYING

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:26.875
TO DO AND I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:29.678
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:30.312
CLARIFY IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.313
ABOUT THAT.

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:33.014
YOU DON'T GET YOUR NOT GONNA GET

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.649
SUED UNTIL YOU RUN THROUGH THAT

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.085
RED LIGHT.

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:39.954
AND SO --

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.056
THAT THAT IS --

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.957
AYE I THINK.

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.226
AGAIN I I THINK FRANKLY THIS IS

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.362
JUST THAT THE FOLKS WHO OR POST

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.164
THIS BILL DON'T WANT THE BILL.

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.899
A BUT WE'VE TIGHTENED UP THE

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:54.736
LANGUAGE THE NOTION OF BYSTANDER --

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.304
TRAINING IT DOESN'T SAY

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.806
BYSTANDER INTERVENTION.

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.941
IT SHOWS US TRAINING.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.576
SO THAT IF A BY STANDER WANTS TO

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.545
INTERVENE.

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:04.913
THERE'S NO ROOM THERE'S NO

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:07.349
LIABILITY IF THEY DON'T THERE'S

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.351
NO MANDATE THAT THEY INTERVENE

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:10.652
IT'S TRUST THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.287
GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS SO THEY IF

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.089
THEY FEEL COMPELLED OR IF THEY

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.757
FEEL EMPOWERED.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.459
THINGS HAD A VERY SIMPLE LIKE

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.494
HELPING MOVE THE VICTIM AWAY

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.862
FROM A DANGEROUS SITUATION WE'RE

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.097
DOING THIS NOW WITH COLLEGE

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.298
STUDENTS AND IN FACT IT IS

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.966
WORKING.

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:26.401
SO LET'S DO THIS IN THE

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.703
WORKPLACE GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:29.804
THAT'S ALL WE DO.

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:32.240
A UNDER THIS AND THEN THE NOTION

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.209
OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS.

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.944
ALL WE'RE DOING IS MIRRORING

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.646
EXISTING CIVIL RIGHTS LAW.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:40.181
SO THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.816
THAT'S THE LAW TODAY IN THE

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:44.419
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTION --

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:45.487
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:47.455
ELSE THAT I MISSED --

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.290
BUT I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT I

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.091
WILL CONTINUE --

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.394
TO WORK --

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.429

FOLKS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

01:23:57.132 --> 01:23:58.833
CONCERNS IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.602
TWEAK THE LANGUAGE THERE IS NOT

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:01.970
GOING TO BE A CRUSHING AMONG THE

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:03.037
LITIGATION.

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.339
ANYMORE SO THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:06.341
TODAY AS THAT DAM HAS FINALLY

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:08.910

THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON%

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.383
WOMEN ARE FINALLY WILLING TO

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.718
STEP FORWARD.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:17.719
AND TAKING DOWN --

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:21.322
SOME VERY WHO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.024
FOR DECADES TO BEHAVE IN A WAY

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.160
THAT IS JUST CONTRARY TO WHAT IS

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.661
APPROPRIATE IN TODAY'S WORLD.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:27.729
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.831

I COULD REDUCE THAT STANDARD TO

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:35.036
SOMETHING MUCH MUCH LOWER THEN

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:35.537

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:36.738
LITIGATION.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:37.939

BREASTFEEDING IS OF VERY

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.864
SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE.

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:17.665
BECAUSE IT SIGNIFICANTLY

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:20.101
DECREASES THE RISK OF

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.769

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:54.869

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:55.403
BREASTFEEDING IS GOOD FOR

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.637
BUSINESS.

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:57.939

WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AMEND

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:26.574
AMENDMENTS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.243
WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE AND WERE

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.345

CARE OF IT.

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.450
AT THIS POINT THE BIGGEST ONE IS

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.018
THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:40.120
RIGHT NOW SO THIS BILL AS THE

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.823
AFTER SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:43.524
BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW SAN

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:45.159

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:46.560
THE REST OF CALIFORNIA.

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:47.494
AND SO THINGS THAT OCCUR IN

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:48.929
HUMANS IS GO DON'T ALWAYS WORK

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.664
FOR THE REST OF THE STATE AND M.

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:52.633
AIDS A FROM THE STATISTICS THAT

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.535
WE'VE RECEIVED AS IT WOULD COST

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:56.870
EMPLOYERS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:57.471
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.405
THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE A

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.307
VERY BASIC LACTATION ROOM.

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:01.875

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:04.111
EMPLOYERS AT APPROXIMATELY FIVE

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:05.546

OF THAT ROOM ANNUALLY AND SO

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:09.483
THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN I'M

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.818
IS THE COST FOR THESE WHILE THE

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:12.319
BILL DOES ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY

01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:13.254
STRUCTURE.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.521
IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:16.357
STRUCTURE IF YOU HAVE A REMODEL

THAT'S HOW YOUTH HAVE TO SPEND

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:11.664
THEIR MONEY --

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.299

AND KEEP THEM FROM SUFFERING AT

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.806
THE INDIGNITY OF HUNGER OF THIS

01:56:23.776 --> 01:56:25.511

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:27.814
FOR THESE REASONS WE WE REALLY --

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.248
ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:30.116

SEE NOT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION.

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:43.830
SEEN ON TIME TO THE MEMBERS OF

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:44.564
THE COMMITTEE SOME AND NEVER

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.466
GONZALEZ FLETCHER SO I ASKED HER

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:48.534
TO PEOPLE OF CONSENT AND WE HAVE

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.303
A HISTORY OF DISCUSSING.

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:51.671
YOUTH WORK PERMITS YOU AND I

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:53.172
MISTER MCGUIRE --

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:56.008
SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE I A WAS

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:57.443
LOOKED ALARMED --

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.379
I I THINK THAT WE HAVE YOUTH

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:01.114
WORK PERMITS FOR A REASON --

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.281
WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:04.884
THAT IS A CHANGING THE LAWS

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.185
AROUND OR ARE SEEKING TO CHANGE

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:06.919
LAWS AROUND.

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:09.088
AND CHILD LABOR LAWS AND WE HAVE

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:10.390
SOME THE STRONGEST NATION I

01:57:10.456 --> 01:57:11.791
APPRECIATE THAT WE WORKED HARD

01:57:11.858 --> 01:57:12.792
FOR THAT.

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:15.862
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND --

01:57:15.928 --> 01:57:16.863
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:18.464
NEEDS FOR CHANGES SO I I WANTED

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:19.999
TO HEAR MORE AND I APPRECIATE

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:21.300
THIS PROGRAM MY CONCERN WITH THE

01:57:21.367 --> 01:57:22.702
BILL IS.

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:24.137
HOW BROAD IT IS AND I ASKED MY

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.872
STAFF I'D ASK?

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.373
YOUR STAFF I THINK FOR EXAMPLES

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.342
IN EVEN WHEN YOU SAY YOU FELT IT

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:30.810
KIND OF MADE MY EARS PERK UP

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.612
THEY RANDY IS BILL PROGRAM --

01:57:32.678 --> 01:57:35.648
AND IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.517
SITUATION BECAUSE IT SIXTEEN TO

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:38.117
TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:40.119
NO ATTACHMENT TO A SCHOOL.

01:57:40.186 --> 01:57:42.088
SO IT PROBABLY WOULD APPLY IN A

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:43.856
YOUTH BUILD SITUATION BECAUSE OF

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.658
THE YOUTH ARE ACTUALLY IN.

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.927
GETTING A G. E. D. OR A HIGH

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:49.462
SCHOOL DIPLOMA AT THE SAME TIME

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:50.897
AS THEY'RE IN THIS PROGRAM SO

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:52.331
THAT PROGRAM.

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:53.232
THAT THE WORK PERMIT COMES FROM

01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:54.600
THAT SCHOOL.

01:57:54.667 --> 01:57:56.002
I THINK A BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:57.937
WE DON'T HAVE STATEWIDE RULES

01:57:58.004 --> 01:58:00.306
AROUND IT SO IT THIS IS EITHER.

01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:01.874
IN MY OPINION NOT BROAD ENOUGH

01:58:01.941 --> 01:58:03.242
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ESTABLISHING

01:58:03.309 --> 01:58:05.077
WHAT THAT CRITERIA SHOULD BE --

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.747
AND TO ENSURE THAT WERE NOT --

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.449
ALLOWING NOT IN THIS SITUATION

BUT IN SOME SITUATIONS YOU CAN

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:13.252
IMAGINE WHERE --

01:58:13.319 --> 01:58:14.754
YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:17.356
EMPLOYERS UTILIZE A YOUNG PEOPLE

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:19.025
WHO THE ATTENDANCE THING KIND OF

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:19.992
CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD BECAUSE I

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:21.160

LAST BILL THAT WE WE HAD TALKED

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:32.839
ABOUT.

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:33.806
WE'RE CREATING KIND OF A

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:36.542
PATCHWORK OF OF EXCEPTIONS FOR

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:37.743

AS I'M I THINK I'M A STAY OFF

01:58:44.684 --> 01:58:45.418
THIS TODAY I DON'T THINK IT

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:47.153
MATTERS --

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:47.720
IT'S GOOD APPROPRIATIONS AND

01:58:47.787 --> 01:58:48.387
SOME [inaudible]

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:50.656
NOW.

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:53.259
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE MY

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:54.994
MY CONCERNS ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:56.429
EVERYTHING THE BOTH OF YOU SAID

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:58.164
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH I JUST

01:58:58.231 --> 01:58:59.398
AM WONDERING KIND OF WHERE WE'RE

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:00.433
GOING WITH THIS.

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:01.367
AND I WOULD BE MUCH MORE

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.902
COMFORTABLE EITHER ST FOR THIS

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.403
PROGRAM.

01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:06.839
THIS IS THE EXCEPTION ON YOU FOR

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.241
FOR TRIBAL YOUTH I I'VE BEEN.

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.709
YOU KNOW PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH

01:59:09.775 --> 01:59:11.711
THAT I I THINK --

01:59:11.777 --> 01:59:13.212
IF WE CREATED A STATEWIDE

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.414
STANDARD FOR WHAT OH BY USE WORK

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:15.948
PERMIT LOOKS LIKE I'D BE

01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:17.483
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT --

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:19.619
BUT I I'M HAVING A HARD TIME YOU

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:20.820
YOU CREATED VERY.

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:24.056
BROAD BILL IN A SENSE THAT COULD.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.625
CREATE SITUATIONS I THINK THAT

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:27.927
ARE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.495
NO I I APPRECIATE AND I WANNA

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.997
FIRST FAULT THINK THESE IN THE

01:59:31.063 --> 01:59:32.198
ONE FOR ALL FOR WORK PARTICULAR

01:59:32.265 --> 01:59:34.066
FOR BUTTE IN WORKING FAMILIES

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:34.600
RIGHT THERE IS NO GREATER

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:35.468
CHAMPION.

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:37.436
AND AND THEN I I WILL ALSO SAY

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:38.804
THAT WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:40.239
LIMIT THIS BILL FROM WHERE WE

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:41.674
WERE IN THE BEGINNING.

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:43.175
SO NUMBER ONE WE'RE NOT CHANGING

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:44.844
ANY DEFINITION OF WHAT A WORK

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.012
PERMIT --

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:47.413
WOULD BE AS FAR AS WHAT IS

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:49.215
CURRENTLY BUT CURRENTLY

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:51.083
QUALIFIES HERE IN THE STATE.

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:53.319
YEAH WE DID NEARLY SO NUMBER ONE

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.555
I STUDENTS CAN ONLY PARTICIPATE

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:57.189
IN YOUTH WORK PROGRAMS THAT

01:59:57.256 --> 01:59:59.458
RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:00.593
SO THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND WORK AT

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.161
STARBUCKS.

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:03.729
THEY HAVE TO BE A WORK WITH ANY

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.331
GOVERNMENT FUNDED --

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:06.933
USE WORK PROGRAM.

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:08.734
BUT WHEN THE QUESTION AT LEAST

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.336
YOUR OTHER PROGRAM THAT WE

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:13.172
ALLOWED I'M AN EXCEPTION REPAIRS

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:14.941
THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED A SOMEHOW

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.275
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AS SPECIALS

02:00:16.342 --> 02:00:17.510
EXEMPTION.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:19.612
CORRECT IN SO THEY DON'T RECEIVE

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:20.813
GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF HER THAT I

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.181
IT'S IT'S AN ADMINISTERED IT'S

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:23.749
OVERSEEN BY THE OFFICE EDUCATION

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:25.117
BUT THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY

02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:27.553
FUNDING ANY GOVERNMENT APPLYING

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:27.920
FOR THAT OKAY.

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.589
ON THE SECOND PIECE IS WE ARE

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.823
LOOKING AT ALL YOUR LONG WHEN

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:32.959
THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY I NIGHT

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:34.694
WE'VE NOW JUST LIMITED TO SUMMER

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:35.595
MONTHS.

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.730
AND SO IT'S JUST FOR THIS DE

02:00:37.797 --> 02:00:38.431
SUMMER --

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:40.333
MINDS -- IN

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:42.268
AGAIN IT'S JUST ON THE SAME

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:43.469
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:45.805
IN PLACE UP FOR YOUTH ACROSS THE

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:47.006
STATE.

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:49.475
BUT AGAIN FOR THIS SPECIFIC BILL

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:51.177
JUST GOVERNMENT FUNDING --

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:51.711
IS WELL IT'S JUST A SUMMER

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:54.580
MONTHS.

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:56.782
YOU I'M SORRY I KNOW WE'RE NOT.

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:57.883
FOURTH KNOW IT'S PLEASE PLEASE

02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:59.485
MISTER CHAIR ALLOW ME TO HOUSES

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:01.387
IS THERE IS THIS ANY YEARS WORK

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:02.855
PERMIT.

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.523
OF ANY AGE FOR HIGH SCHOOL.

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.424
SO THEY HAVE TO BE IN HIGH

02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:06.459
SCHOOL I THINK I MISSED THAT SO

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:08.194
THAT WAS.

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.895
SO BAD BUT I AS I WOULD BE

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:12.965
FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN IT COULD BE

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:13.499
IF YOU'RE.

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:15.701
YES IT COULD BE.

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.269
SO I WHAT I DO WANT TO FRAME UP

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:17.970
SOMETHING AND THAT IS THAT.

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:19.238
SO.

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:21.207
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY.

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:22.775
SO WHAT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:25.111
IS IT WOULD SAY --

02:01:25.177 --> 02:01:25.678
YOU STILL HAVE TO GET A WORK

02:01:25.745 --> 02:01:27.213
PERMIT.

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:28.981
THE WORK MY PERMIT STILL HAVE TO

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:31.017
MEET ALL OF THE THE RULES --

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.885
AND THOSE INCLUDE ALL OF THE

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:36.322
PROTECTIONS FOR YOUTH WORKERS --

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:38.924
BUT BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THAT USE

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:41.594
A SUMMER LA LA A SUMMER MONTHS

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:41.894
[inaudible]

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:43.996
WORK PERMIT. FOR A GOVERNMENT

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:46.265
FUNDED EMPLOYMENT YOUTH

02:01:46.332 --> 02:01:48.434
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM.

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:50.569
IT IT JUST SOLELY ON THE BASIS

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:52.838
OF THEIR GRADES AND ATTENDANCE

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:54.607
DURING THE SCHOOL YEARS.

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.575
IF OUR SCHOOL SCHOOL MONTHS IF

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.277
YOU CAN DENY IT BECAUSE THE

02:01:58.344 --> 02:01:58.911
PLACE WHERE YOU'VE APPLIED TO

02:01:58.978 --> 02:01:59.679
WORK.

02:01:59.745 --> 02:02:02.682
DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARDS YEAH --

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:05.117
YOU COULD DO THAT YOU CAN'T DENY

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:06.686
IT SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:08.254
GOT POOR GRADES DURING THE

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.689
SCHOOL MONTH AND THEN GIVE THEM

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:10.723
NO OPPORTUNITY IN THE SUMMER

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:11.924
MONTHS --

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.459
AND AND THAT'S THAT THE VERY

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:14.994
NARROW PIECE THAT THIS BILL IS

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:17.263
CURRENTLY DOING.

02:02:17.329 --> 02:02:18.531
I THINK YOUR QUESTION THOUGH IS

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:20.032
A DOES THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:21.200
HAVE -- OF A

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.501
NOTE BY SAYING GOVERNMENT IS

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.236
THAT IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:25.638
STANDARD --

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.440
I THINK WHEN WE TALKED AT THE

02:02:27.506 --> 02:02:28.674
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR IN THE

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:31.277
BILL WAS INTRODUCED WITHOUT YES --

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:33.512
BUT TODAY WERE HONORING REFUGEES

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.414
AND WERE LOOKING AT WHAT'S

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:37.283
HAPPENING AT OUR BORDER.

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:39.485
IT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN WITH

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:40.419
CONFIDENCE SAY THAT A FEDERAL

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:42.321
WORK PROGRAM UNDER THIS

02:02:42.388 --> 02:02:43.723
ADMINISTRATION --

02:02:43.789 --> 02:02:47.059
WOULD A PROTECT TO USE I THINK

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:49.128
YOUR QUESTIONS ARE GOOD --

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:52.031
ONE AND IT'S ONE WE DIDN'T AND I

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.365
WOULD ADD ONE MORE IN THERE TO

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:55.868
CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD I AM

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:57.136
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:02:57.203 --> 02:02:58.370
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ON THIS.

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:00.639
NOW SAYING THAT.

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:01.741
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN SOLVE THIS

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:02.608
PROBLEM WITHOUT INCLUDING

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.844
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.212
PROGRAMS RIGHT RIGHT I WOULD

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:07.513
ASSUME THAT THIS IS A FEDERAL

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.348
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM YET DID

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:10.282
ABSOLUTELY AS TONIGHT I JUST

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:11.317
WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THING

02:03:11.383 --> 02:03:13.119
BECAUSE I AM ACTUALLY THE PERSON

02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:14.120
WHO GOES OUT.

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.855
AND WORK WITH THE YOUTH.

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:18.224
AND THIS BECAME A VERY BIG

02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:19.558
CHALLENGE BECAUSE I SPEND THE

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:21.260
MAJORITY OF MY TIME DURING THIS

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:22.828
TIME OF THE YEAR.

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:23.662
GOING TO SCHOOL DISTRICT AFTER

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:25.264
SCHOOL DISTRICT NOT JUST IN ONE

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:27.266
AREA BUT I SERVICE OF ALL

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:29.001
COUNTIES FROM SAN JOAQUIN TO

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:30.503
MODOC TO DOWN OR AND EVERYTHING

02:03:30.569 --> 02:03:31.504
IN BETWEEN.

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:33.005
AND THE CONSTANT CHALLENGES IS

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.507
THAT OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE A

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.442
SUMMER PROGRAM FOR OUR STUDENTS

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:37.810
THERE ARE NO SUMMER SCHOOLS

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:39.645
THERE'S NO SUMMER CLASSES

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:40.946
THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE YOU'VE

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:41.380
TO DO.

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:43.048
AND THEN THEY DENIED THE YOUTH A

02:03:43.115 --> 02:03:46.652
WORK PERMIT SO I HAVE A I GREW A

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:51.090
GROUP OF YOUTHS WHO WERE AGES.

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:51.690
FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WHO WERE

02:03:51.757 --> 02:03:52.625
SITTING IN THE SUMMER WHO ARE

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:54.260
NOW DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:55.961
CANNOT WORK THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:57.797
WELL IN SCHOOL THEY CANNOT DO

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:59.098
ANYTHING AND NOW WE'RE FIGHTING

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:01.000
TO KEEP THEM OFF DRUGS TO KEEP

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:02.168
THEM ENGAGED IN TO KEEP THEM

02:04:02.234 --> 02:04:02.535
BACK.

02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:04.804
SCHOOL SO FOR THAT IT IT'S VERY

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:06.639
PASSIONATE AND EVEN THOUGH WE

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:08.707
ARE TRIBAL COMMUNITY WE WORK

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:11.010
WITH ALL STUDENTS SO WE HAVE

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:13.112
MANY OF YOUTHS WHO COME INTO OUR

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:15.347
PROGRAM WITH FRIENDS AND WE WORK

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:16.816
WITH THEM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM

02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:18.150

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:20.753

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:24.023
HELP IN AYE LIKE IF AND I'M.

02:04:24.089 --> 02:04:25.891
I DON'T THINK I EVER OPPOSE THE

02:04:25.958 --> 02:04:27.459
WESTERN CENTER THE WHOLE --

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:28.861
SAID THIS IS TOP I JUST WANT TO

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:30.496
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FIND

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:32.731
OURSELVES IN A POSITION.

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:34.600
ON THAT WE'VE ALLOWED A LOOPHOLE.

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:35.768
I I WILL SUPPORT THE STATE I

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:37.203
WILL ASK FOR TWO THINGS ONE THAT

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:39.572
THAT WE REVISIT THIS QUESTION ON

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.740
ON THE FEDERAL --

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.075
I'M PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:45.177
PROGRAMS ON JUST IN CASE THINGS

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:46.312
CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:47.580
FAR AS PROTECTIONS.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:49.949
AND THE SECOND BEING I'M I CAN'T.

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.150
I'M TRYING I CAN THINK OF AN

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:54.153
EXAMPLE OF A OF A ENTERTAINMENT

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.521
WORK PERMIT THAT WOULD FALL

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:57.156
UNDER ONE THESE CATEGORIES BUT

02:04:57.223 --> 02:04:57.823
I'D LIKE THEM EXEMPTED FROM THE

02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:59.291
SPELL --

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:01.060
BECAUSE THAT.

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.061
THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE

02:05:02.127 --> 02:05:02.695
ENTERTAINMENT WORK WITH WORK

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.164
PERMIT AND SCHOOLING ON THE SAT

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:07.233
AND AND THE FACT THAT IT'S YEAR

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:09.134
ROUND AND IT'S NOT THAT.

02:05:09.201 --> 02:05:10.169
I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEIR

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:12.071
THIRD DOESN'T BECOME A LOCAL

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:14.106
STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAM --

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.941
AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW.

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.409
MY DAUGHTER HAD A WORK PERMIT.

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:19.078
SADDAM YOU NOW AND THERE HAD TO

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:20.346
BE A TUTOR ON SAT NIGHT I DON'T

02:05:20.412 --> 02:05:22.147
WANT THOSE FEES EXEMPTION

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:23.782
SOMEHOW REPLIED AS THE THAT

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:24.950
YOUNG AND IT'S A TOTALLY

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:27.820
DIFFERENT GROUP OF KIDS RIGHT SO.

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:29.521
THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY REQUEST

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:31.257
TREATMENT MY AND ONE ANIMAL ADDS

02:05:31.323 --> 02:05:32.658
THAT IS WILD TRAVEL TEAM IT DOES

02:05:32.725 --> 02:05:34.693
RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS THERE ARE

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:35.961
STATE STANDARDS.

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:37.997
THAT ADEN STUDENTS HAVE TO BE

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:40.199
ABLE TO ABIDE BY OUT WHEN IT

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:41.533
COMES TO THESE WORK PERMITS AND

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.635
SO I THINK THAT THE OTHER REALLY

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:44.336
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS.

02:05:44.403 --> 02:05:45.604
YES THEY'RE RECEIVING FEDERAL

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:47.106
FUNDING BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:50.009
STATE STANDARDS AS WELL

02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:50.309
[inaudible]

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:51.977
THANK.

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.545
SO YOU WILL WORK WITH ME ON

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:55.047
THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THEM FIVE ON

02:05:55.114 --> 02:05:57.483
THE ISSUE OF EXAM.

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:58.350
SO.

02:05:58.417 --> 02:05:59.551
I MEAN I MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.386
WITH I MEAN I MIGHT LOOK BE

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:01.487
LOOKING FOR SOLUTION WITHOUT A

02:06:01.553 --> 02:06:02.388
PROBLEM ON THE ENTERTAINMENT

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:03.923
WORK PERMIT I JUST IT JUST IS A

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:04.990
RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THE

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.458
RULES ARE SO DIFFERENT.

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:07.259
AND IT IT IS THE WORK PERMIT THE

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:10.062
GUY.

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:11.263
BY DIFFERENT THAT WE CLASSIFIED

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:13.899
AND AND THE DEFINITIONS HERE BUT

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.968
YOU'VE PERMITS --

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:17.603
FOR FOR ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:18.971
THAT THE AGES GO MUCH LOWER SO I

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:21.273
THINK THE ONE JUST BEING HONEST

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.775
ABOUT THIS ONE CHALLENGE WE HAD

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:23.409
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE LOOKED

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:25.978
AT GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND OR

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:27.146
GOVERNMENT HOSTED WORK PERMIT

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.681
PROGRAMS.

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:31.550
I IS BECAUSE IT GOT OUT OF THE

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.519
PRIVATE SIDE OF THE MARKET.

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:35.688
I AND IF WE'RE GONNA. ONE

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:36.622
CONCERN I WOULD HAVE IS IF WE'RE

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:37.923
GOING TO EXEMPT ONE INDUSTRY

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.058
THEN WE MAY HAVE ON IT OTHER

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.426
INDUSTRIES COMING ASK FOR

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:41.727
EXEMPTIONS THAT'S WHY WE TEND TO

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.862
LOOK AT THOSE GOVERNMENT FUNDED

02:06:43.929 --> 02:06:46.031
GOVERNMENT RUN PROGRAMS --

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:47.399
WHAT I WOULD GET INTO THAT'S I

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:48.434
DON'T WANNA SAY?

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.202
ABSOLUTELY EXEMPTION ALL ALL I

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:51.236
WANTED TO DO WAS JUST LOOK AT IT

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:52.638
AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:53.672
SCHEDULE ME WITH YOU TO BE AND

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.407
TALK MORE ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:56.575
TRYING TO BE QUIET AND NOW BUT

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:57.276
LET'S.

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.544
LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE ASKING

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:01.413
EXEMPTION FROM AN EXEMPTION FROM

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.581
EXEMPTING THEM FROM SCHOOL.

02:07:02.648 --> 02:07:03.816
RIGHT AND IT'S A DIFFERENT

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.351
SITUATION MIGHT BE AT UNDER

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:08.554
DIFFERENT WORK PERMIT BUT IT'S

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:10.089
AN INDUSTRY THAT I AND I CAN'T

02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:11.557
IMAGINE [inaudible]

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:14.159
I OF FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:15.361
BUT THERE COULD BE ONE

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:16.628
ESPECIALLY NOW ACTUALLY WITH THE

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.330
FILM TAX CREDIT I THINK I

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:20.366
REMEMBER THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:21.700
ABOUT CREATING AND PRE

02:07:21.767 --> 02:07:24.303
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM --

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:25.904
FOR I OUT SEE MEMBERS AND STUFF

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:26.872
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.441
WE'RE NOT --

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.744
TAKING AWAY WHAT HAS BEEN BUILT

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.312
INTO THE ENTERTAINMENT WORK

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:34.780
PERMITS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THAT

02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:36.615
REQUIRE ON SET TUTORS AND

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:38.617
SCHOOLING AND AND DIFFER ES

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:39.451
DIFFERENT SET OF REQUIREMENTS

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:41.920
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL THAT.

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.055
IN MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE

02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:44.790
GET THROUGH AND YOU CLEAN UP

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:45.724
LANGUAGE ON BECAUSE I THINK THE

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.226
FEDERAL.

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:48.827

FEDERAL WHAT'S GOOD CHANGES THE

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:52.931
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:54.066
MAKE ON SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.200
AND WHAT PROTECTIONS WE HAVE IN

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:56.468
STATE LAW THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:57.503
THIS THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:58.003
THAT THIS.

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.038
WE'RE NOT GONNA END UP IN A

02:07:59.104 --> 02:08:01.407
SITUATION THAT'S I'M NOT

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:03.042

COUNTRY'S FOODS [inaudible]

02:16:34.986 --> 02:16:37.155
AND NOTS ACCORDING TO THE

02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:37.956
NATIONAL ARE QUICK TO SURVEY

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:39.891
OVER 6% OF FARMWORKERS ARE

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:41.526
UNAUTHORIZED AND VARIOUS SOURCES

02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:42.961
ESTIMATE THAT THE NUMBER.

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:43.528
OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS MAKE

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:47.098
SEAT. TO CLOSE 275%.

02:16:47.165 --> 02:16:48.433
IF THOSE UNAUTHORISED WORKERS

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.368
WERE TO BE DEPORTED --

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:51.503
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS SOME

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.838
PROGRESSIVE AS IMMIGRATION

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.440

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:58.310
RECENT.

02:16:58.376 --> 02:16:59.978
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:02.547
BE A MAJOR A NATIONAL FOOD

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.349
SHORTAGE SECURITY PROBLEM.

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:05.617
BEFORE AS WELL I BELIEVE THAT

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:06.618
STATE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS

02:17:06.685 --> 02:17:07.852
THEIR OWN LABOR ISSUES THE US

02:17:07.919 --> 02:17:09.521
CONSTITUTION.

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:10.789
MAKES IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.390
IMMIGRATION ISSUES ARE UNDER THE

02:17:12.457 --> 02:17:12.958
JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:14.826
GOVERNMENT.

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:15.994
TODAY'S FARMWORKERS ARE AGING

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.429

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:17.996
I DO NOT WANT TO WORK IN THE

02:17:18.063 --> 02:17:20.565
FIELDS AND MEANWHILE THERE ARE

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:21.666
FEWER IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:23.401
COUNTRY TO REPLACE THEM.

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:24.669
THIS RESOLUTION WOULD PUT THE

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.137
ISSUE OF LABOR SHORTAGES ON THE

02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:27.539
RADAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:28.873
AND WOULD URGE CONGRESS TO ALLOW

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.141
STATES TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN

02:17:30.208 --> 02:17:31.977

CONVERSATION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO

02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:45.523

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:46.825
WE HAVE ONE WITNESS AYE THAT

02:17:46.891 --> 02:17:48.093

SALINAS AND MONTEREY COUNTY.

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:57.936
WHEN WE PREPARED A THIS EFFORT?

02:17:58.003 --> 02:17:59.504
IT WAS -- TO

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:00.238
SUPPORT --

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:00.839
AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH

02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:06.044
YOU HEARD. TO TO VOTE ON THE

02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:07.746
REALITY IS THAT THE DISCUSSIONS

02:18:07.812 --> 02:18:09.748
IN CONGRESS TODAY ARE EITHER

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:12.384
AROUND CHILDREN OR AROUND DHAKA.

02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:13.818
BOTH POPULATIONS DESERVE A

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:15.420
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION

02:18:15.487 --> 02:18:17.722
AND RESOLUTION TO THE SPECIFIC.

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:19.424
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CONFRONT THEM

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:21.026
BUT WHAT WE CONTINUE TO IGNORE

02:18:21.092 --> 02:18:22.727
THE PARENT GENERATION.

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:24.262
WE TRY TO PUT THIS RESOLUTION IN

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:25.330
THE CONTEXT OF AN ECONOMIC

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:27.365
REALITY AND THAT IS THAT THE

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:29.234
AMERICAN BORN WORKERS REGARDLESS

02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:30.702
OF THEIR ETHNICITY IN THE RACE.

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:31.936
DO NOT WANT TO WORK IN THE

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:33.705
FIELDS OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:35.040
THAT'S REGARDLESS OF THE

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:36.875
INCREASE IN WAGES --

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.977
THERE ARE A CLEAR --

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:41.012
CROPS THAT ARE INCREASING THEIR

02:18:41.079 --> 02:18:42.714
WAGES TO TRY TO ATTRACT AMERICAN

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:43.848
BORN WORKERS.

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:45.350
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TAKING PLACE

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:47.519
IN THE HEARING THAT YOU HAD ON

02:18:47.585 --> 02:18:48.253
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE YOU HAD.

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:49.721
A REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE OF THE

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:51.056
ORGANIZATION'S OPPOSED TO THE

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:53.358
BILL INDICATING THAT THERE WERE

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:54.459
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:55.593
THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THE

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.362
UNEMPLOYMENT OF ROLES OF THE

02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:58.763
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:01.166
ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT OF THOSE

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:01.766
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:02.434
ARE INTERESTED IN COMING OUT TO

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.668
WORK IN THE FIELDS.

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.403
AND NOW THERE IS AN ARGUMENT

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:06.805
THAT SAYS YOU COULD PAY FIFTY

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:07.906
DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THEY WOULD

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.107
COME OUT TO WORK.

02:19:09.174 --> 02:19:10.742
AVOCADOS PAY TWENTY DOLLARS AN

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:11.543
HOUR --

02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:13.111
GRAPES ARE PAYING UP TO

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:14.512
SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.214
THESE ARE GOOD WAGES --

02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:16.715
AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOW

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:20.185
CARRYING --

02:19:20.251 --> 02:19:21.252
SO I THINK IT'S VERY VERY

02:19:21.319 --> 02:19:23.755
IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:25.657
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:26.591
INJECTING.

02:19:26.658 --> 02:19:28.326
A VERY IMPORTANT --

02:19:28.393 --> 02:19:30.028
NARRATIVE THAT IS BEING LOST IN

02:19:30.095 --> 02:19:32.063
THE DEBATE IN CONGRESS AND THAT

02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:34.132
IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PARENTS.

02:19:34.199 --> 02:19:35.366
THE PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING THE

02:19:35.433 --> 02:19:36.434
PARENTS WHO ARE MAKING

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:37.235
CONTRIBUTIONS --

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:38.937
WHO IN MOST CASES IN THIS

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:40.538
POPULATION OF FARM WORKERS HAVE

02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:42.507
BEEN HERE BETWEEN TEN AND

02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:44.008
SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE UNITED

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:45.710
STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA WORKING?

02:19:45.777 --> 02:19:48.446
SO UNFORTUNATELY THE ELEMENTS IN

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:49.414
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN

02:19:49.481 --> 02:19:50.515
CONGRESS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:51.916

ARE TRUE IN WHAT THEY CAN IT

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:55.153
APPEARS THAT FROM ALL MIT MEDIA

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.321
COVERAGE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

02:19:56.387 --> 02:19:57.388
THEY'RE EXCLUDING.

02:19:57.455 --> 02:19:59.591
A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC --

02:19:59.657 --> 02:20:01.292
REALITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:03.261
WHICH IS AGRICULTURE AND THEY IN

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:04.596
THE PROCESS ARE IGNORING THE

02:20:04.662 --> 02:20:06.097
POPULATION THAT MAKE THAT

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.298
ECONOMY.

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:08.733
OUR THAT ECONOMIC SECTOR

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:11.636
CALIFORNIA AS EFFECTIVE AND IS

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.972
PRODUCTIVE AND IMPORTANT AS IT

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:14.973
IS SO.

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.074
WE HOPE THAT --

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:17.776
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:18.777

CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING --
