BACKGROUNDS WE HAVE SEEN

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.992
CHANGES IN HOUSE STAFF INTERACT

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.060
WITH THE INMATES BECAUSE THEY

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.162
SEE IN MAKES HIS YEAR THERE WAS

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:23.762
A DAY WHEN INMATES WOULD JUST

GOING TO PROGRAM WHAT THAT DOES

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.471
IS ESTABLISHES A MORE HEALTHY

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.473
ENVIRONMENT AS I TO THE PRISONS

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.842

REGARDING THE ROLE OF. SOME

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:03.869
OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS.

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:04.970
INTERACTING WITH INMATES IN

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:05.838
TERMS OF EDUCATION AND

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.706
REHABILITATION. I REALLY VALUE

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.507
OUR PARTNERS OUR COMMUNITY

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.008
BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.342
VOLUNTEERS THAT COME IN I THINK

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.711
ONE OF THE MOST. ONE OF THE

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:13.479
MOST SUCCESSFUL THINGS THAT

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.013
WOULD OTHER THAN AGENCIES

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:14.480
WELCOME THE FORMERLY

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:15.881
INCARCERATED TO COME BACK AND

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:16.382
FACILITATE SOME OF THESE

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:16.882
COURSES TO THE INMATE

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:17.950
POPULATION. AND I THINK THIS I

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.918
KNOW WHAT THIS DOES IS BRINGS

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:21.020
CREDIBLE MESSENGERS TO THE

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:23.455
INMATES BUT THEY CAN SPEAK OF

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:24.490
THE NEW HOPE THAT IS OUT THERE

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:26.458
IN THE COMMUNITY AND ENCOURAGE

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.294
THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.228
AND THAT THE PROGRAM THAT

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.030
THEY'RE IN. THAT IT DOES MAKE A

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.398
DIFFERENCE IF PEOPLE ARE

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:34.300
WATCHING SO THAT IN ITSELF TO

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.634
HAVE FORMALLY INCARCERATED

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.002
COMING BACK IN AND SPEAKING

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:38.904
POSITIVE YOU INTO THESE LIVES

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.105
BUT THEN ALSO THE STAFF THAT

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:41.473
WITNESS SOME OF THE INMATES THE

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.008
FORMALLY CULTURE TO THE COME

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.811
BACK. THEY MAY HAVE THEY MAY

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.313
HAVE OVERSEEING THEM MAYBE SIX

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.647
MONTHS AGO A YEAR AGO AND IT IS

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.082
GOOD TO SEE THE FRUITS OF THAT

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.117
WORK SO FOR ME THAT IS THE

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.819
THAT'S A CULTURE SHIFT INSIDE

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:56.922
THE INSTITUTIONS. I WELCOME

00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:01.160
MORE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES A

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:01.727
SOME MORE RURAL AREAS WE'RE

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:06.398
MAKING HEADWAY OUT THERE. THANK

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.032
YOU IN. WHEN WE HAD A CHANCE TO

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.434
TALK MOM. I RAISED AN ONGOING

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.234
CONCERN I KNOW IT'S A SHARED

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.636
CONCERN OF. CONTRABAND COMING

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:13.172
INTO THE PRISONS FROM. DRUGS

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:16.375
WEAPONS CELL PHONES THAT CAN BE

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:19.411
WEAPONIZED IN A SENSE. IN

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.413
THERE'S VERY HIGH SECURITY AND

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.449
SCRUTINY OF FAMILY MEMBERS

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:26.418
VISITING DURING VISITING HOURS

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.020
BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN FOUND

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.588
THAT SOME OF THE HOLES IN THAT

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.423
SECURITY ARE WITH STAFF

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.525
EMPLOYEES EVEN GUARDS BRINGING

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.795
IN CONTRABAND. WHAT WILL YOU DO

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:42.935
TO. THAT. THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.670
IN OUR SYSTEM THAT AFFECTS THE

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:45.971
SAFETY OF INMATES GUARDS AND

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:49.675
STAFF I THINK ONE ONE THING

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.110
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE DONE WE

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.277
HAVE A TWO YEAR PILOT THAT ONE

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:55.114
INSTITUTION AT THE- CALIFORNIA

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:55.647
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.883
FACILITY IN CORCORAN TO WHERE.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.318
WE HAVE EVERY STAFF MEMBER

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.886
COMING IN IS SEARCH SIMILAR TO

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:02.087
WHAT THE WAY YOU'D BE SEARCHED

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.089
IN AN AIRPORT WE HAVE INCREASED

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:06.258
BAGGAGE CAN LIVE INCREASE STAFF

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:09.294
TO WERE AND STAFFING TO WERE

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:09.862
STE STAFF CAN BE SEARCH MORE

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:13.165
CLOSELY. WE NEED TO MOVE

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.366
FURTHER ALONG THOSE ALONG THAT

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.268
TRACK BUT I NEED TO HAVE THE

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.269
DATA AT THIS ONE PILOT TO MAKE

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.405
SURE WE MOVE FORWARD. IN AN

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:20.539
EFFICIENT AND A FISCALLY

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.541
RESPONSIBLE WAY. I THINK THAT

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.443
WAS A DAY IN IN MY OWN TEN YEAR

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.577
I WOULDN'T I WOULD HAVE

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:27.513
CHALLENGE ANYONE THAT AND STAFF

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.515
ON INVOLVED IN THIS BUT-

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:30.983
UNFORTUNATELY I'VE HAD THE

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:31.884
EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SEEN THE

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.852
STAFF TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:34.720
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.021
STAFF MEMBER THAT WOULD AGREE

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.222
THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING I

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.591
BELIEVE THE STAFF TO DO THIS.

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:40.726
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS TO CHANGE

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:41.693
LIVES AND HAVE A SAFE

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.961
ENVIRONMENT THEY SUPPORT THE

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.963
EFFORTS TO. ROOT OUT STAFF WHO

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.765
ARE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THIS

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.134
ACTIVITY. WHEN WAS THE PILOT AT

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.437
CORCORAN BE COMPLETED WHEN YOU

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.172
HAVE DATA TO LEARN I SHOULD

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.907
HAVE DATA BY NOVEMBER OF

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:58.710
TWENTY. IN WHAT'S THE PROSPECT

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:02.981
FOR EXTENDING. THOSE PROTOCOLS

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.750
AT CORCORAN TO ALL MMHM

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:05.284
SECURITY FACILITIES AND IS

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.253
THERE ANY RESISTANCE FROM STAFF

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.789
OR BARGAINING UNITS TO

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:13.826
INSTITUTE STRICTER FROM ENTRY

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:16.528
AND EXIT CRITERIA I THINK THE

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.729
RESPONSIBLE THING FOR ME TO DO

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.131
IS TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHEN IT

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:20.399
WHEN WE GET FINISHED WITH THAT

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.400
PILOT AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:24.203
BASED OFF THAT DATA. I DON'T

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:24.770
WANT TO ENTER INTO ANYTHING

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.939
GREATER THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A-

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:28.340
PUT A DENT IN THIS BUDGET OR

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:30.042
ASK FOR RESOURCES THAT I CAN'T

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:31.410
WITH CONFIDENCE SAY THAT THIS

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.312
IS THE WAY TO GO MAYBE I CAN

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:33.912
USE PIECES. OF THIS PILOT BUT

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:37.349
NOT THE WHOLE THING. I HAVE

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:37.816
WORKED CLOSELY IN THE

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.284
DEPARTMENTS WERE CLOSELY WITH

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:40.652
LABOR. WITH THE BARGAINING

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:42.921
UNITS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:44.490
ARE ON BOARD WITH HAVING SAFE

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.158
INSTITUTIONS. THERE ARE SOME

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:47.860
CHALLENGES WITH. JUST WITH THE

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:49.228
CONCEPT OF SEARCHING THE THOMAS

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.864
OF THE DO WE TRUST AFTER NOT.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.464
AND IT DIDN'T AND I THINK THE

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.767
CASE IS. WE ARE WANTING SAY

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:56.802
FACILITY IS NOT A MATTER OF

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:57.936
TRUST IT'S ABOUT TO MATTER OF

00:18:58.003 --> 00:18:58.770
SAFETY THAT'S ABOUT

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.305
COMMUNICATING TO OUR LABOR

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:00.873
PARTNERS ON WHY WE'RE DOING

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.242
THIS. THANK YOU IN. AGAIN

PILOT PROGRAM ARE THERE ON

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.913
GOING SECURITY PROTOCOLS THAT

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.682

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:13.485
INTERCEPT CONTRABAND WHATEVER

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.521
VIA WHATEVER ROUTE IT MIGHT BE

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.856
ENTERING WE HAVE A WE HAVE A

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.691
CANINE PROGRAM THAT IS A STATE

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:21.660
WIDE PROGRAM STATEWIDE EFFORT

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:23.862
AND THAT DOES WE HAVE

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.397
DESIGNATED STAFF ON A STATEWIDE

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.765
BASIS THAT GOAL FROM PRISON TO

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.934
PRISON. UTILIZED DOGS TO SEARCH

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:29.935
OUT CELL PHONES TO SEARCH OUT

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.272
CONTRABAND THE DEPARTMENT HAS A

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.674
POLICY AND IT'S ON THAT WE DO

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.509
RANDOM SEARCHES OF STAFF ON A

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.845
HOLISTIC LEVEL WE MAY JUST SLOW

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:42.047
DOWN THE SEARCH STAFF IN A MORE.

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.482
IN A SLOWER WAY IN A MORE

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.083
DETAILED WAY FROM TIME TO TIME

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.052
AS PART OF OUR PROTOCOLS I

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.220
THINK ANYTHING WE VENTURE INTO

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.856
THE HOUSE TO BE DATA DRIVEN AND

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.358
HAS TO BE A BEST PRACTICE. BUT

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.360
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE INTEREST

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:55.961
TO SOMETHING THAT FOUR YEARS

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.363
DOWN THE ROAD SAY IT DIDN'T GET

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.298
DIDN'T GET THE RESULTS YOU WANT

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.065
BUT WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:04.469
THANK. BEEN UNDER CURRENT

IS SMUGGLING CONTRABAND IS THAT

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:09.841
GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION YES IT

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:13.412
IS IT AUTOMATIC TERMINATION

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.780
THEY HAVE TO PROCESS LIKE A AN

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:15.747
EMPLOYEE THEY HAVE AN

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.115
INVESTIGATORY PROCESS AND WE

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.283
PUT WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR RIGHTS

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.751
AVAILABLE TO THEM WITH

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:22.754
REPRESENTATION. BUT IN THE END

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:23.755
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:25.090
PREVENT STAFF AND TO TOUR

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.626
STAFFER PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:28.694
THE END ANY CONTRABAND THAT

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.496
COMES IN IS DANGEROUS. THE IN

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.432
MY POPULATION THERE IS A HIGH

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.968
VALUE DOLLAR TO THESE ITEMS AND

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:37.469
IT DISRUPTS ARE REHABILITATED

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.905
PROCESSES IN A REALIZE YOU MAY

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:45.544
DATA THAT WOULD REFLECT SOME

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.212
DISCIPLINE IN ORDER MANY

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:49.781
NATIONS OF STAFF RELATED TO

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.750
CONTRABAND OVER THE LAST FIVE

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:57.856
YEARS YES I CAN APPRECIATE.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:58.423
THANK YOU AND THEN. MY FINAL

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.226
QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S. THE

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:02.160
INQUIRY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:02.995
LITIGATION BUT IN YOUR OPENING

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.063
STATEMENT AND I DON'T INTEND TO

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.331
GO INTO AREAS OF ACTIVE

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.201
LITIGATION WITH SPECIFICS. IN

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:10.836
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU DID

DIVERSITY AND GENDER EQUITY IN

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:21.413
RECRUITMENT IN RETENTION IN AND

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.951
PROMOTION COULD YOU SHARE WITH

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.686
THE COMMITTEE WHAT SOME OF

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:30.822
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE IN IN YOUR

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:33.358
BROADER COMMITMENT MOVING

RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.735
PROMOTION. SO THIS ISSUE IS OF

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.037
MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND I

00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:47.406
TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY ONE OF

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:48.106
THE FIRST THINGS I DID AS A

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:50.509
SECRETARY WHEN PRESENTED WITH A

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:51.910

TO SEE WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:00.819
AND WHAT THAT GROUP IS TEN IS

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:03.088
SO WE CAN EXAMINE INTERNALLY

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.756
WITH OUR DATA ON A HIRING

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.692

MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HIGHER

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:11.963

GENDER A GENDER. A STEP THAT'S

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.008
LOOKED BEYOND GENDER BECAUSE

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.377
THE QUALITIES AND SKILLS THAT

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.845

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.663
GROUP. I SHIP THAT THAT GROUP

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.397
UNDER OUR OFFICE OF CIVIL

RIGHTS WILL OVERSEE IT. THE

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:47.666
GROUP WILL BE MAKING

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.367
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OFFICE

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:51.269

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:58.744
CHANGES. ONE THING THAT I I'M

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.978
WELL AWARE OF AS A TOURING THE

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.279
INSTITUTIONS. AND NOT HAVING TO

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.162
BECAUSE WITHIN THAT DIVERSITY

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.965
WE HAVE IDEAS WE HAVE COURAGE

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.767

OUT OPENLY AND THINK

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.870
DIFFERENTLY. ONE THING THAT WE

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:25.937
HAVE ALREADY SEEN WITH THIS

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.506

VERY UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:32.944
WITH THESE WARDENS THAT THEY

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.312
HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:35.347
AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE FACING THE

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.149
SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA IS. WE

NEED TO DO BETTER. ON WHO WI

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:41.186
HIGHER. AND WE HAVE TO

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:41.787
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PEOPLE

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.054
HAVE VALUE AND THE TAP THE

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.056
HIGHER. NOT JUST BASED ON WHAT

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:46.091
THEY SEE EVERY DAY WE HAVE TO

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:48.160
BRING IN. A DIVERSITY OF

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:49.528
INDIVIDUAL SO WE CAN HAVE A

00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:51.530
GOOD GROUP. IT IS ONE OF MY

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.165
HIGHEST PRIORITIES TO MAKE SURE

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:53.765
WE HAVE A DIVERSE WORKGROUP I

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:56.168

BUT I KNOW IT WAS A CHALLENGE

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:19.457
AND I KNOW. IF SOME OF THESE

00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:21.293

REHABILITATION. WE NEED TO DO

WHEN THEY GET OUT. SO HAVING TO

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.958
DO WITH THAT IN IN JANUARY THIS

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:29.160
YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR CAME OUT

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:29.728
WITH A REPORT IT WAS KIND OF

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:33.064
CRITICAL. OF THE OVERSIGHT.

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.599
THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:35.967
DOING REGARDING REHABILITATION

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.702

PORTIONS OF THE REPORT. I DO

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.518
WELCOME ANY AND ALL CRITICISM

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:54.119
THE REPORTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:56.288
BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED THEM.

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:57.255
WE HAVE TO SEE THINGS ONLY

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:59.324
BECAUSE IN THE END YOU KNOW WE

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.926
WERE HERE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.627
THE PEACE OF THE REPORT THAT I

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.429
DIDN'T AGREE WITH I THINK THAT

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:05.597
WITH THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:06.631
REPORT WAS A WORK COGNITIVE

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:09.334
BEHAVIOR PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.902
IS ALMOST NEARLY 70% OF THAT

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:13.071
REPORT. BUT IT ALSO CHALLENGE

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.472
US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE REST

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.875
OF OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.077
SO FOR AS AN AGENCY IT IS OUR

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.579
GOAL NUMBER ONE TO REHABILITATE

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:24.049
THE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT ARE

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:24.649
GOT PUT IN THE CDC AREN'T TWO

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:27.052
THOUSAND AND SIX. UNFORTUNATELY

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:27.919
THE RECESSION CAME UPON.

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:28.853
SHORTLY AFTER WAS DECIMATED A

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.155
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WE

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:32.424
BUILT UP. SINCE THEN AND-

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.491
THAT'S REFLECT A LITTLE BIT IN

00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:36.027
THAT REPORT. I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.862
REHABILITATION IS OUR NUMBER

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.198
ONE GOAL IN THE PRISON SYSTEM.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.167
AND MORE POORLY TO HAVE THE

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:45.437
MOST VALUABLE. TOOL OUT THERE'S

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:46.338
OUR OUR STAFF MEMBERS TO

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:48.239
UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE ROLE. AND

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:49.207

GOAL OF THIS PROCESS NUMBER ONE

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:42.487
IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:44.622

THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO WE

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:32.670
GO INTO A MORE FORMAL INTERNAL

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:36.040
AFFAIRS INQUIRY. AND THOSE IN

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:37.742
CORY'S CAN LEAD FOR EVERYTHING

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.510
FROM TERMINATION TO FINDING

EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO THERE

00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:45.616
IS A PROCESS IN PLACE I'M

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:48.386
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.767
GRAVITY AND THE LARGESS THE

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:09.073

IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THE MOST. I

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:20.685
THINK. THINGS WERE GOING TO DO

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:21.853
ONCE WE IMPLEMENT THIS SYSTEM.

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:22.487
IS WE WILL BE REMOVING. THE E.

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:23.488
E. O. COORDINATOR WHO DOES

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:24.121
RECEIVE THE COMPLAINTS FROM THE

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:25.122
COUNSELORS. OUTSIDE OF THE FEEL

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:25.990
THEY WILL BE REGIONAL ALLIES

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:26.858
IT'LL BE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:27.758
TO REVIEW WHAT IS RECEIVED. AND

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.093
THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK. IT WILL

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.194
NO LONGER JUST BE WITHIN THE

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.829
FIELD FOR HIGHER THAN THIRTY.

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.264
RECEIVES IT MAKES AN ASSESSMENT

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.098
IT WILL NOW BE WITH THE

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.900
COORDINATOR WHO THEN REPORTS OR

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:36.801
OFF THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND HEAD

QUARTERS. SO I'M LOOKING

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:41.939
FORWARD TO THAT. AND IN THE END

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:44.075
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:45.443

THAT WE'RE GONNA STAB WISH. BUT

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.879

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.021
THAT WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. AND
