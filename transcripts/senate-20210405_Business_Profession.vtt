THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING CODE

PROTOCOLS. IT IS TRUE THAT THEY

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.384
CAN SUSPEND A LICENSE. BUT THIS

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.852
ONLY OCCURS AFTER AMPLE

TWO TO THREE HUNDRED CASES.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:32.007
THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:35.310
PERCENT. THIS MEANS THAT NINETY

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.112
NINE POINT 9% OF LICENSEES WERE

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.747

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:09.744
CLEARY VIOLATING THE CURRENT

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:12.681
HEALTH ORDER THAT'S OF COURSE

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:15.717
OF PROCESS. IF A LICENSEE

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.552
OBSERVED TO BE IN VIOLATION.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:18.887
THE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIES A

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:20.689
LICENSEE AND PROVIDES THEM WITH

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:23.024
IF OPPORTUNITY COMPLY IF THEY

THEY DON'T COMPLY ABC. I CAN

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.397
THEN TAKE ACTION THIS USUALLY

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.633
MEANS LICENCES PLACED ON THE

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.635
FIFTEEN DAY PROBATIONARY PERIOD

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.237
DURING THIS PERIOD THE LICENSEE

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:36.371
IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO SERVE

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:39.074
ALCOHOL AS LONG AS THEY COMPLY

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.709
IF THEY DON'T THEY COULD FACE A

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.511
FIFTEEN DAY SUSPENSION. IF IT

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.212
REACHES THIS STAGE A LICENSEE

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.548
COMPARE FIVE INSTEAD OF SERVING

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.583
THAT SUSPENSION IF THEY CHOOSE

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.152
TO SERVE THE SUSPENSION THEY

01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:51.553
CAN STILL CONTINUE TO SERVE

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.556
FOOD OR NON ALCOHOLIC DRINKS.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.191
IF THE LICENSEE STILL FAILS TO

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.193
COMPLY ABC COULD DO IT EVEN

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.061
LONGER SUSPENSION OR EVEN

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.763
REMOVE REMOVED TO REVOKE THE

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.632
LICENSE BUT AGAIN THIS WILL

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.433
ONLY OCCUR IF THE LICENSEE

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.202
WILLFULLY REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.271
HEALTH ORDER. I'D MENTION ALL

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:13.909
THIS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ISNO SUCH THING AS ABC SUSPENDING

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.544
A LICENSE TO IS COMPLIANT THEIR

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.712
LICENSES ONLY SUSPENDED AFTER

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:19.881
THE LICENSEE HAS WILLFULLY TIME

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.217
AND AGAIN REFUSED TO FOLLOW

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.653
COBIT HELPED ORDERS. I

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.321
UNDERSTAND IN IN THE SUPPORTER

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:28.957
OF MALL BUSINESS I SPOKEN

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:35.197
NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS FLOOR-

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.464
IN ORDER TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS.

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.366
A OF THE I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:39.901
WHAT THIS IS THE TO OUR- IN THE

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:42.270
PORTS A CAT ALPHA LIGHTS. BUT I

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:43.071
DON'T WITH MEMBERS THE SENATE A

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.806
NUMBER OF BILLS THE SEEK TO

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.308
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HELP TO

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.343
THESE BUSINESSES. HOWEVER I

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:49.878
THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:52.581
CONSIDER THE NINETY NINE POINT

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:55.016
9% OF THE LICENSEES WHO ARE

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.118
DOING THEIR PART IN COMPLYING

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.186
WITH THE HEALTH ORDER

01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.654
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.590
AGREE WITH IT OR NOT. I THINK

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.658
THIS BILL IS UNFAIR TO THEM AND

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.493
PLACES THEM AT A HUGE

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.962
DISADVANTAGE AND I CANNOT

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.763
SUPPORT THAT. I KNOW THEY'RE

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.498
GOING TO BE AYE WE DOES ABOUT

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.533
THESE EVENTS BUT IS THE CHAIR

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.201
OF GEO I THINK THE CURRENT LAW

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.469
ALREADY PROVIDES FOR MORE THAN

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.304
ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY. FOR

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.374
LICENSES- LICENSEES TO COMPLY

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:24.479

AND- I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.929
REMIND THE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.932
COMMITTEE DATA. WE HAVE

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:47.135
EVENTUALLY HAD ALMOST SIXTY

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.570
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DIED OF

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:50.405
THIS DISEASE. THIS IS A

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.774
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IT SPREADS

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.409
IT SPREADS QUICKLY IF NOT

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:59.247
LIMITED. AND IT IS IMPORTANT

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.816
THAT THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:05.453
ARE NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.755
SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE THAT NOT

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.256

HOSPITALIZED OR INJURED MANY

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:18.466
OTHERS. AND FRANKLY- BUSINESS

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.535
WILL BE DOWN IN RESTAURANTS.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.137
WHEN THE DIZZY WHEN THE VIRUS

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.271
SPREADS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.908
AFRAID TO GO OUTSIDE RIGHTFULLY.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.710
AND I THINK IF WE'RE REALLY

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.046
LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO-

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.814

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:34.316
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THE

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.917
SPREAD OF THE VIRUS

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.687
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL- WOULD

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:41.690

TO EVENTUALLY SPREAD THE VIRUS

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:51.032
EVEN FURTHER- BY CAN TRYING TO

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.467
CONTINUE OPERATIONS WHEN

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.169
CLEARLY THERE'S BEEN AMPLE

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.504
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO- MAKE

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:59.641
CORRECTIONS OR TO ADD TO MEET

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:01.743

DEFIED SEVERAL ORDERS- THAT

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.292
LEAD TO THAT POINT AND I GUESS

THAT. WE PASS A BILL THAT SAYS

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:59.106
NO ONE HAS TO FOLLOW ANY RULES.

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:01.275

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:21.195
HOW I READ THE BILL PERHAPS

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.597
I'M- MISTAKEN- I'M GONNA BE

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.865
OPPOSING THIS RIGHT NOW JUST

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.634
BECAUSE I. DO THINK IT.

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:28.369
INCLUDE TOO MANY BUSINESSES

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.504
THAT- FLOUTED THE LAW AND WE

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:31.839
SEEN EXAMPLES OF EVERY SINGLE

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.441
PERSON I'VE READ ABOUT. THAT

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:35.209
HAS BEEN HAMMERED BY ABC HAS

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:36.510
BEEN SOMEONE WHO HAS TALKED

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:38.012
ABOUT HOW THESE RULES THEY

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.146
DON'T AGREE WITH THEM THEY'RE

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.448
PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK WE'RE

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:42.149
NOT EPIDEMIC RIGHT NOW PEOPLE

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.451

REFUSED TO FOLLOW IT. AND I

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:46.487
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.155
BODY ESTABLISH AND REINFORCE

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:50.424
THE RULE OF LAW. THAT WE DO NOT

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:52.860
REWARD THOSE WHO WOULD GO OUT

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.795
AND SAY RIDE ON THE CAPITAL

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.263
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.698
LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. AND

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.767
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.002
THE LAW BE APPLIED EQUALLY TO

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:02.470

EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO COMPLY

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:48.162
BEST THEY CAN'T EVEN KEEP THEIR

WELL FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.181
CONSUMERS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:10.217

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:12.853

HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SO FORTH-

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:15.856
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:19.727
RESPECT IS BUSINESSES WHO GO

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:20.661
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY TO MEET

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:23.130
THE BED AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.999
IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESSES

01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:27.101
BUT WHAT I ALSO RESPECT IS THE

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:29.236
CONSUMER'S ABILITY TO CHOOSE

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:30.671
WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN THEY

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:33.240
WILL PATRONIZE. BUSINESSES THAT

01:38:33.307 --> 01:38:36.076
MEET OR THEY FEEL MEET THE

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.778
HEALTH REQUIREMENTS AND

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:38.812
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:41.048
PLACE I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS AND

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.816
FRIENDS WHO WILL NOT VISIT-

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.184
PATRONIZE BUSINESSES THAT DO

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:45.919
NOT MEET THOSE RECORDS IT

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:46.820
DIDN'T THEY DON'T FEEL THAT

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.857
THEY ARE MEETING OUR THE HELP

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.325
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE IN

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.794
PLACE SO I APPRECIATE THAT BY

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:54.428
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANT

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:57.264
TO MENTION IS- BOTH FROM A

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:58.999
FORMER SCHOOL BOARD PERSPECTIVE

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:01.468
AS SOMEONE WHO. UNDERSTANDS THE

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.570
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IS THAT

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:05.839
MANY BUSINESSES AND PUBLIC

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:07.975
ENTITIES ARE AFRAID TO CONDUCT

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.076
BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF THE

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.444
LIABILITIES THAT THEY FIND

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:11.178
THEMSELVES IN THE

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:12.946
VULNERABILITIES OF BEING THAT

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:15.449

FOLLOW OF IT SAFETY PRODUCT. I

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.395
ALSO WE- THE CONSUMERS. BUT IF

THEY DO NOT SEE THE HEALTH

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:32.366
WORKERS BEING THAT THEN PERHAPS

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.600
THE YOU KNOW THEY CHOOSE NOT TO

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.135
PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS JUST

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.103

UNFORTUNATELY THE AUTHOR HAS

LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S NOW

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:41.381
GOING ON NINE YEARS. I'VE

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.684
THOUGHT THAT IN MOST CASES NOT

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.019
ALL. A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.088

OUR CALIFORNIA REGULATORY

01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:56.763
NOT IT'S- AN I GOTCHA SITUATION

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.298
IN MANY CASES ON THE ONLY.

01:43:58.365 --> 01:44:01.368
CONSEQUENCE OF THE GOTCHA IS

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:03.337
HOW SEVERE THE PENALTY IS. AND

01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:05.405
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. AND THIS

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.207
BILL BEGINS TO EMBED

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:09.076
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IN A

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.978
REGULATORY SCHEME. IT'S

01:44:11.044 --> 01:44:13.213
DIFFICULT TO ARGUE AS MANY OF

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.848
US HAVE ON THE AFFIRMATIVE

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:16.617
SIDE. THAT SUBSTANTIAL

01:44:16.683 --> 01:44:18.352
COMPLIANCE SHOULD BE THE

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.053
STANDARD IN SOME AREAS OF

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.221
BUSINESS REGULATION WHETHER

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:24.758

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.915
THING LIKE I DO HAVE A QUESTION

ENJOY SAVINGS- PARTICULAR ON

02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:15.127
MAINTENANCE DRUGS WHERE THERE

02:02:15.194 --> 02:02:16.862
PROBABLY ISN'T A NEED FOR A DAY

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:18.330
DIRECT PHARMACIST PATIENT

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:20.166
CONSULTATIONS. I TRY NOT CLEAR

02:02:20.232 --> 02:02:21.167
ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:22.768
GOT- THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:25.237
THE FUTURE- BUT I WOULD HOPE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:26.305
THAT THERE'S SOME MIDDLE GROUND

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:28.774
THERE- FOR A FAIRLY NARROW USE

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:31.310
CASE. WHERE IF YOU HAVE ANY TO

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:33.045
DESCRIBE AND IF YOU CAN PROVE

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:34.980
OR IF THERE'S SOME INSURANCE-

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.982
THAT THE CUSTOMER FOR PATIENTS

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:39.118
RECEIVING THE BEST PRICE- BUT

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:40.786
THAT WOULD STILL BE ACCEPTABLE

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:44.590
SO IF YOU. COULD SPEAK TO THAT

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.525
I'D BE GRATEFUL- WITH THROUGH

02:02:46.592 --> 02:02:48.260
THE CHAIR. YES PLEASE- THANK

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:50.763

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:52.765
THERE. NOT ONLY THE BILL'S

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:53.966
CONSTRUCTED BUT ALSO WITH THE

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.868
AMENDMENTS THERE IS NOTHING

02:02:55.935 --> 02:03:00.239
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT SAY THE-

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:03.175
PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER. FROM

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:05.544

TO THE CONSUMER THAT- PHARMACY

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.618
X. WOULD GIVE THE PRESCRIPTION

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:14.954
AT A LOWER PRICE THERE'S

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:15.521
NOTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:19.525
THAT. IT JUST PROHIBITS

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:21.660
INDICATING THAT YOU COULD ONLY

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:24.163
USE THAT PHARMACY SO IF THE

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:26.699
PATIENT CHOOSES FOR EXAMPLE TO

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:27.867
HAVE TO YOU KNOW PAY A HIGHER

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:29.769
COPAY OR PAVE FURTHER OUT OF

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:32.571
POCKET. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW

02:03:32.638 --> 02:03:35.608
IT BUT IT DOES NOT LIMIT THE

02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:37.243
ABILITY FOR DEAN BENEFITS

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:39.945
MANAGER TO NEGOTIATE A

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:40.646
DIFFERENT PRICE WITH THEIR

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:42.681
PREFERRED AND AGAIN YOU JUST

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:44.083
WENT THERE SO THAT THE UNIT IS

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:44.917
JUST AFFECTING THE DIFFERENCE

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:46.519
BETWEEN OPT IN AND OPT OUT

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:50.523
THEN- WHERE THE- THE PATIENT.

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:53.125
WOULD HAVE TO FIRMLY OPT IN TO

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.794
A PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO WEAR

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.095
THE HEALTH PLAN COULD GIVE THEM

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.263
THE OPTION OF OPTING OUT WELL

02:03:57.329 --> 02:03:58.430
IT'S NOT SO MUCH OPT IN OR OPT

02:03:58.497 --> 02:04:00.666
OUT RIGHT NOW CERTAIN OF THESE

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:04.069
BENEFITS MANAGERS ARE BASICALLY.

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:05.437
COMMUNICATE TO THE PATIENTS

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:07.473
THAT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE YOU CAN

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.309
ONLY USE PHARMACY X. AND SO

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:11.510
WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS THAT

02:04:11.577 --> 02:04:12.845
YOU COULD USE WHICHEVER

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.547
PHARMACY YOU CHOOSE WITHIN THAT

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.682
NETWORK. THE PATIENT BENEFIT

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:18.083
MANAGER THE PRESCRIPTION THAT

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:20.553
MAKES COMMUNICATE THAT THERE'S

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.621
THIS ADVANTAGE TO X. OR Y. AND

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:23.889
THEN YOU COULD CHOOSE TO DO

02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:24.957
THAT IF YOU CHOSE IF YOU WOULD

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:27.193
LIKE TO BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:28.928
FORCED TO. SHOW ACTION ISSUE

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.729
RIGHT I DO APPRECIATE IT ONE OF

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:33.666
THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECTS OF

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:34.567
OUR INSURANCE COULD SYSTEM AS

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.936
IT EXISTS IS THE- PICK THE

02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:38.904
OPACITY OF PAYMENT. RIGHT SO

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:40.105
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:41.574
CUSTOMERS OR PATIENTS TO MAKE

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.476
DECISIONS- THAT OFTEN- WILL NOT

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:49.114
BE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE- YOU

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:50.449
KNOW WE'VE HAD. THE LEVERAGE

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:51.684
OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS TO

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:53.853
PRODUCE TRêN- BUT IT IS TRUE.

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:55.955
THAT THERE PROBABLY ARE ALL

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:59.592
BEING EQUAL A CLUB- CHIU FOR

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:00.359
DELIVERING SHOULD THE

02:05:00.426 --> 02:05:01.327
PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ONE IS.

02:05:01.393 --> 02:05:02.962
CHEAPER AND SO I WOULD MAKE

02:05:03.028 --> 02:05:05.998
SURE. LEAST HAVE INSURANCE-

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:07.867
THAT WE DON'T FOR GO THAT

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:09.635
POSSIBILITY AS PART OF THIS

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:13.272
BILL. FROM THE INTEREST THING

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:14.573
ABOUT THIS AS WELL WELL

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:15.808
SOMEBODY OPPOSITION MIGHT

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:20.646
CLAIM. THAT THERE. THAT THE ARE

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:25.618
STEERING. TO A PARTICULAR CHAIN

02:05:25.684 --> 02:05:26.819
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE SHE SHE SAID

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:29.288
AS AN EXAMPLE. IT IS BECAUSE

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:30.990
IT'S GOING TO GREATLY REDUCE

02:05:31.056 --> 02:05:34.159
COSTS AND THUS BE LESS BURDEN

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:36.295
ON ALL OF US SINCE ALL OF US IN

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:40.766
FACT- INSURANCE IS A IS A POOL.

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.401
SO ALL OF A SHARE IN THE COST

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:43.502
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT IN

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:45.838
FACT ANY OF THEIR STEERING HAS

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:48.774
REDUCED ALL OF OUR COSTS AND

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:51.110
WHAT IN FACT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:53.379
VERY OFTEN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:56.515
MANAGER IS STEERING. TO THE

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:58.284
CLUSTER PHARMACIES THAT IS

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.586
PHONE THAT THE IN OTHER WORDS

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:03.422
THE ENTITY. THAT OPERATES

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:07.092
PHARMACIES ALSO OWNS THE

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:09.194
PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGER. VERY

02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:10.562
BAD AND YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:12.932
ME. THAT- THOSE PREMIUMS ARE

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:14.667
OPERATE MAIL ORDER FACILITIES

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.869
COULD PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SOME

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:18.370
FASHION AT THE GIVING THE

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:20.472
CUSTOMER THE CHEAPEST PRICE AT

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:21.073
THE END THROUGH THAT HEALTH

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.242
PLAN SAVING. ALL OF US MONEY

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:25.577
AND SO AGAIN MY HOPE IS THAT WE

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:26.812
DON'T WE DON'T ELIMINATE THAT

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:28.514
POSSIBILITY FOR LEGISLATION I

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.982
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:32.184
PRECLUDE THAT AND- CERTAINLY

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.752
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW WE

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:36.055
CONTROL COSTS WITHIN. OUR

02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:37.990
HEALTH- DELIVERY SYSTEM IN OUR

02:06:38.057 --> 02:06:40.059
INSURANCE IS SEPARATE FROM THIS

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:41.927
BILL WELL I THINK THE

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:44.496
OPPOSITION'S CLOUDING THE ISSUE

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:46.365
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:48.067
SPECIFIC IN THIS BILL THAT

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.268
WOULD EITHER GUARANTEE A

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:54.139
REDUCED COST. OR PREVENT. THANK

INSURED AND THEN USE A PBM FOR

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:19.398
COST SAVINGS WHEN I WAS IN A

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:20.699
STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL USED ONE

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.901
AND I USED A SMALL MOM AND POP

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:24.603
PHARMACY THAT IS SADLY NOW GONE

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:27.773
OUT OF BUSINESS BUT IT IT- IT

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.842
IT JUST DID MAIL ORDER OR JUST

02:07:29.908 --> 02:07:30.943
SOME OF THE BIG CHANGE AN

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:33.145
ARGUMENT WAS FOR A COST SAVINGS

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.279
BECAUSE OF COULD YOU SPEAK A

02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:36.148
LITTLE. ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:40.219
AND THEIR ROLES IN AND BE USING

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:42.287
PBMS. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:44.456
AMONG THE EMPLOYERS THAT USE

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:49.495
PBMS. AND THIS AGAIN WOULD- NOT

02:07:49.561 --> 02:07:52.031
PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. AND

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:54.199
IT WOULD STILL ALLOW THE PBM TO

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:56.468
COMMUNICATE TO THE PATIENT WHAT

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:58.237
A PREFERRED PHARMACY IS OR WHAT

02:07:58.303 --> 02:08:00.205
A FARM A PHARMACY THAT MIGHT

02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:01.707
GIVE THEM A DISCOUNT. FOR

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:04.276
EXAMPLE. IN THIS ALSO WOULD

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:06.378
STILL REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:07.246
USE A PHARMACY WITHIN A

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:09.681
NETWORK. SO IT IT ISN'T THAT

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:11.216
YOU WOULD GET TO YOU KNOW

02:08:11.283 --> 02:08:12.584
COMPLETELY GO OUT OF NETWORK

02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:14.787
AND EXPECT. YOUR INSURER TO

02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:19.892
COVER THAT COST- SO IT. IT IN A

02:08:19.958 --> 02:08:21.160
WAY IT'S KIND OF A HYBRID IN

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:24.596
THAT. IT WOULD IT JUST.

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:28.367
PREVENTS THE PBM FROM.

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:31.503
SPECIFYING THAT YOU CAN ONLY

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:43.082
USE PHARMACY X. SEARCH LOCAL.

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:45.651

02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:50.327
CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED ON ONE

02:32:50.394 --> 02:32:53.430

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.116
TECHNOLOGY USED WITHOUT REGARD

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:14.718
TO COST NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:16.587
IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY BEING

02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:19.189
USED IN THE COURT- TO THE

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:22.526
EXTENT THAT. A LAWYER. IS A

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:24.628
PROPONENT OF EITHER A WITNESS

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:27.831
OR EVIDENCE AND THAT TECHNOLOGY

02:33:27.898 --> 02:33:30.868
FAILS THEN. IT'S THE LAWYER

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:32.436
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING

02:33:32.503 --> 02:33:34.138

THAT EVIDENCE COMES IN SO USING

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.711
THE EXAMPLE BECAUSE STARTING A

02:33:40.778 --> 02:33:43.147

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:45.115

SOMETIMES NOT CAN TAKE QUITE A

02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:51.622
LONG TIME TO GO THROUGH RECORDS

02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:53.724
AND AUTHENTICATE THEM. IF THE

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.526
TECHNOLOGY FAILS AND YOU DECIDE

02:33:55.593 --> 02:33:56.527
YOU'RE GOING TO USE REMOTE

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.329

AT A LOSS AND YOU REALLY CAN'T

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:07.738
ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE SO YOU

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:19.917
USE TECHNOLOGY FOR SOMETHING

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:20.851
AGAIN LIKE A MINISTER A

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:25.389

02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:27.391
SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT CREATE

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:29.126
EFFICIENCIES IN THE COURT IN

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:32.363
FACT IT IS COUNTER. OUR EFFORT

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.632

HEALTH EMERGENCIES RESULT. OF I

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.782
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.618
TO WAIT AGAIN IF YOU'RE COUNCIL

YOU'VE GOT TO RESORT TO AN

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:03.293
ALTERNATIVE METHOD I THINK BY
