FINDINGS OVER TO REPORTS MY

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.117
BRIEFING TO YOU WILL FOLLOW THE

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:23.354
FACT SHEET. I FIRST PRESENT

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.488
YOUR FINDINGS ON THE SCREENING

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:27.591
PROCESS BEGINNING. IN EARLY

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:29.593
MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THE

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.228
DEPARTMENT TOOK SEVERAL STEPS

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.364
TO PROTECT INSTITUTIONS. FROM

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.765
STAFF AND OUTSIDE VISITORS WHO

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.634
COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.536
CORONAVIRUS INTO A PRISON. THE

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.271
FIRST THING THE DEPARTMENT DID

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:40.738
WAS TO SUSPEND NORMAL

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:44.141
VISITATION. THIS IS HAVE AN

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:46.210
ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.112
INCARCERATED POPULATION BUT

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:49.847
THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THAT THIS

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:52.016
IS A NECESSARY PRECAUTION TAKE.

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:52.917
THE NEXT STEP THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.018
TOOK WAS TO BEGIN VERBAL

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:56.387
SCREENING OF ALL STAFF AND

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:57.955
VISITORS WHO ENTER PRISONS.

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:59.089
LIKE TWO WEEKS AFTER THE VERBAL

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:01.091
SCREENING BEGAN. THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.226
ADDED TEMPERATURE SCREENING TO

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.394
THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.695
PERSON WAS PERMITTED TO ENTER

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:08.432
PRISON. WE NOTED SOME

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.201
DIFFICULTIES THE DEPARTMENT HAD

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.303
IN IMPLEMENTING THESE MEASURES.

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.737
FIRST THERE WAS NO STANDARD

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.673
THAT THE PRISONS USED FOR THEIR

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.907
SCREENING PROCESS SOME%

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.576
INSTITUTIONS SCREEN STAFF AND

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.544
VISITORS AND THEIR VEHICLES

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:21.111
BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE MAIN

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:23.180
PROJECT AROUND. AND SOME

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.548
PRESENCE DID NOT SCREEN STAFF

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.116
AND OTHERS UNTIL AFTER THEY

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.252
PARK THEIR VEHICLES AND WALKED

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.253
TO A SCREENING AREA ON PRISON

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.655
FOR. SOME SCREENING AREAS WERE

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.490
RATHER PROXIMAL TO THE PARKING

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.726
AREA BUT AT SOME INSTITUTIONS.

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:36.894
PEOPLE WERE NOT SCREENED UNTIL

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.395
AFTER THEY HAVE A THROUGH AREAS

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:39.997
WHERE THEY POTENTIALLY EXPOSE

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.932
STAFF INCARCERATED PEOPLE PRIOR

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.369
TO THEIR SCREENING. IN ADDITION

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.338
WE FOUND THAT WE'RE SCREENING

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.273
WAS NOT DONE PRIOR TO PARKING.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.275
THERE WAS A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:51.809
THAT NO SCREENING WOULD BE

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.944
CONDUCTED. IN THE CASE OF MY

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.146
OWN STAFF THIRTY EIGHT TIMES

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.114
OUT OF TWO HUNDRED TWELVE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.515
VISITS. MY STAFF WAS NOT

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:01.418
SCREENED. THIS EQUATES TO

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.954
NEARLY 20% OF OUR VISITS. I

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:05.756
WANT TO ADD THAT MY STAFF WAS

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.524
NOT TRYING TO AVOID SCREENING

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:08.759
BUT RATHER IN MANY

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.761
INSTITUTIONS. THE SCREENING

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:13.364
LOCATIONS WERE NOT READILY

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.399
APPARENT AND AT ONE PRISON WE

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.267
RECEIVED CONFLICTING

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.102
INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHO NEEDED

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:19.637
TO BE SCREENED FROM THREE

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.572
DIFFERENT PRISON STAFF. IN A

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:25.009
SURVEY WE CONDUCTED. 5% OF CDCR

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:27.544
STAFF WHO RESPONDED. NOTED THAT

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:28.913
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SCRIPT EVERY

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:33.384
TIME. SECONDLY WE FOUND THAT

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.919
LITTLE TO NO TRAINING WAS

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.921
PROVIDED TO THE SCREENERS. THE

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.322
SCREENERS WERE A MIX OF CUSTODY

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.324
AND HEALTH CARE STAFF WHO ARE

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.293
ASSIGNED TO THE STUDENTS. IT

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.261
APPEARS THAT NON MEDICAL STAFF

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.529
WAS NOT VERY WELL TRAINED ON

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.230
THE THERMOMETERS THEY WERE

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.132
USING. WE LOOK AT TRAINING

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:50.868
RECORDS FOR A SAMPLE OF SEVENTY

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:51.368
FIVE SCREENERS AT FIVE

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:53.304
DIFFERENT PRISONS. AND FOUND

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.872
THAT MOST SCREENERS HAVE

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:57.675
RECEIVED NO TRAINING. ON THEIR

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.710
PRISON SCREENING PROCESS. FOR

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:01.111
THE VERY FEW WOULD RECEIVE SOME

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:04.048
TRAINING. NONE RECEIVE TRAINING

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:06.050
SPECIFIC TO THE THERMOMETER

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:06.650
THEY WERE GIVEN FOR SCREENING

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:09.820
PURPOSES. FINALLY THE EQUIPMENT

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:12.189
ITSELF WAS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE.

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:13.958
IN OUR SURVEY APPROXIMATELY TWO

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.826
THIRDS OF THE SCREENERS NOTED

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:17.161
THAT THEY HAD ONLY

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:17.928
MALFUNCTIONING PARAMETERS TO

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.497
USE. WE ALSO NOTED THAT MANY

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.066
STAFF REPORTED TO US THAT THE

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.734
THERMOMETERS THEY WERE USING

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.903
STOP WORKING BECAUSE THEY RAN

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.104
OUT OF BATTERY POWER AND

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.839
SCREENERS DID NOT HAVE FRESH

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:31.742
BATTERIES AVAILABLE. AS A

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:32.776
RESULT OF THESE ISSUES WE'VE

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:33.277
MADE A NUMBER OF

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:35.379
RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.381
CHANGING SCREENING LOCATIONS.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:38.349
MAKING SURE SCREENERS ARE

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:40.150
PROPERLY TRAINED MAKING SURE

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:40.751
THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.354
SERVICEABLE. AND MAKING SURE

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.622
SPUR BATTERIES WERE AVAILABLE.

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:47.391
OUR SECOND REPORT FOCUSED ON

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:50.127
THE DEPARTMENT USE OF PERSONAL

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:50.728
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND MASK

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:53.497
USAGE. IN EARLY MARCH THE

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.965
DEPARTMENT MADE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:56.133
EFFORTS TO LOCATE AND

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.035
DISTRIBUTE PP FOR THOSE WHO

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.371
NEEDED TO BE A DIRECT CONTACT.

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:01.805
WITH PATIENTS WHO HAVE SIGNS

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.407
AND SYMPTOMS OF CODE NINETEEN

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.042
OR THOSE INCARCERATED PEOPLE

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:07.745
WHO'D BEEN EXPOSED TO POSITIVE

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.913
CASES OF CODE NINETY. THE

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.415
DEPARTMENT OF THE MEDICAL STAFF

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.416
THAT SHOULD BE LAUDED FOR THEIR

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:14.251
SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.186
THE PPP NEEDED. FOR DIRECT

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.288

MORE THAN SIX FEET FROM OTHER

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.250
RELAXING OF REQUIREMENTS DID

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.552
NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:23.487
DYNAMIC NATURE OF WORK AND LIFE

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.956
IN A PRISON. WHERE AN INCIDENT

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.524
REQUIRING IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IS

00:45:27.591 --> 00:45:29.393
A NORMAL OCCURRENCE. THE

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.562
RELAXING OF REQUIREMENTS CAME

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.197
DESPITE THE FACT THAT ACTIVE ON

PERSONS THAT WE VISITED. IT

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.092
DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.627
DEPARTMENT VIGILANTLY ENFORCE

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.928
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FACE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:07.331

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:07.898
DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:10.834
OUR REPORT. AT FIVE PRISONS WE

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:11.735
CAPTURED THE NUMBER OF

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.270
SUPERVISORY ACTIONS OF PUNITIVE

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:14.705
ACTIONS FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:17.374

TO COMPLY WITH FACE COVERED

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.123
DIRECTIVES. WE BELIEVE THE

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.224
DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.492
AGGRESSIVE IN DISCIPLINING

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:37.094
THOSE WHO REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.963
POLICIES THAT ARE FOUNDATIONAL

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.564
TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THIS

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.401
DISEASE. I AM AWARE THAT BOTH

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.702
THE RECEIVER AND SEX AND THE

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.070
SECRETARY HAVE RECENTLY

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:49.506
EMPHASIZED. WITH WARDENS THE

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.641
IMPORTANCE OF THE FORCING THESE

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.042
POLICIES AND I APPLAUD THEIR

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.645
EFFORTS. OUR OFFICE OBSERVE

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.980
FIRST HAND THE POSITIVE EFFECT

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:58.715

PRESSURE TO ATTEMPT A MOVEMENT

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.452
OF THOSE MEN OUT OF CIM BECAUSE

FOR BEING RETURNED AT THAT TIME

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:09.812
THE PRACTICAL EXPECTATION WAS A

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.493
TRANSFERS CDCR HAVE

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.794
SUCCESSFULLY AND SAFELY

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.831
TRANSFERRED OME SIXTY EIGHT

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:15.865
HUNDRED PATIENTS BETWEEN

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.835
INSTITUTIONS. WITHOUT SPREADING

PROGRAM NINETEEN. AFTER THE RE

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.338
DRAFTING OF THE TRANSFER

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.107
PROTOCOLS AFTER SAN QUENTIN'S

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.875
OUTBREAK CDC ARE HAVE

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.210
SUCCESSFULLY AND SAFELY

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.811
TRANSFERRED OVER SIX THOUSAND

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:30.847
PATIENTS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.648
WITHOUT INCIDENT. THAT'S GOOD

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:36.219
NEWS HOWEVER I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:37.720
THAT I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:40.123
ONLY SEE ONE OR MORE TRANSFERS

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.891
INTER INSTITUTION TRANSFER IS

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.527
TRIGGERING OUTBREAKS IN

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.196
RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.931
EVEN THOUGH OUR TITAN PROTOCOLS

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.700
THE VIRUS IS A VERY GOOD AT

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.535
FINDING WAYS OF SPREADING AND

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.970
CIRCUMVENTING PROTECTIVE

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.706
MEASURES. AND HUMAN BEINGS WILL

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.741
INEVITABLY MAKE MISTAKES GIVEN

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.277
THE VIRUS THE OPPORTUNITY IT

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:05.248
NEEDS TO SPREAD. I WANT TO SKIP

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.450
AHEAD HERE IN THE INTEREST OF

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.952
TIME BUT IN CONCLUSION- NOTED

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:12.455
CDC R. AND C. C. H. C. UP STAFF

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.124
HAVE PERFORMED WITH COURAGE.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.326
AND DEDICATION THROUGHOUT THE

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.695
PANDEMIC. AND OUR PATIENTS HAVE

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.764
CONTRIBUTED TO OUR EFFORTS.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:23.399
BASED ON WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.367
IN CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS AROUND

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.135
THE COUNTRY AND BASED ON A

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.603
REVIEW OF THE CDC'S

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.072
CORRECTIONAL GUIDELINES- I CAN

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.674
REPRESENT YOU THAT WE ARE DOING

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.442
EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN OUR

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.978
EXISTING ENVIRONMENT TO FIGHT

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.980
THE SPREAD OF OVER NINETEEN.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.982
HOWEVER FROM A HEALTH

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.918
PERSPECTIVE. THE HOUSING

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.586
CHOICES AVAILABLE TO US WITHIN

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.722
THE CDC ARE REMAIN PROBLEMATIC.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.425
CDC ARE ESSENTIALLY CONSISTS OF

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.026
LARGE CONGREGATE LIVING

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.961
FACILITIES A SUBSTANTIAL

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.263
PORTION OF WHICH ARE OPEN

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.699
DORMITORY SETTINGS. THESE

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:57.667
DORMITORY SETTINGS IN

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.135
PARTICULAR ARE THE WORST

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.269
POSSIBLE SETTINGS FOR

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.371
CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF THE

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.807
HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. SO

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.576
EVEN IF OVER NINETEEN VACCINES

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.277
BECOME AVAILABLE TO US NEXT

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.246
YEAR AS I BELIEVE THEY WILL. IT

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:12.815
IS I THINK INEVITABLE THE NEW

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.117
AND POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:16.886
DANGEROUS VIRUSES WILL SOMEDAY

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:19.322
APPEAR. AND I THINK THE STATE

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.157
NEEDS TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.692
SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT TYPE OF

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.360
HOUSING OPTIONS NEED TO BE

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.529
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CDC OURS

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.397
INSTITUTIONS. SO THAT WE CAN

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.066
AVOID THE HARM THAT THE NEXT

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.668
PANDEMIC IS OTHERWISE SHORT TO

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:37.139
COST. THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.208

CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:21.117
EFFORTS. TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.286
OF COPE WITH NINETEEN INSIDE OF

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:28.791
OUR FACILITIES. SINCE MR KELSO-

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.526
TESTIMONY PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.962
OF WHERE WE ARE IN OUR EFFORTS

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:36.365
TO COMBAT KOBE IN NINETEEN

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:36.966
INCLUDING THE LESSONS LEARNED

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:39.235
FROM SAN QUENTIN. I'M GOING TO

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:41.771
FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON. THE

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.939
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OFFICES

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:47.410
OF INSPECTOR GENERAL'S. REPORT

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:49.712
THE FIRST TWO REPORTS IN HIS

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.281
SERIES OF REPORTS SPECIFICALLY

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:56.886
SCREENING AND MASKS. COMPLIANCE

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.421
I WILL NOT BE COMMENTING ON THE

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:01.357
L. A. O.'S- AND DISCUSSION

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.826
REGARDING THE SAN QUENTIN AND

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.929
STAGE CREW COURT ORDER AS

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.699
THEY'VE HIGHLIGHTED. WE ARE

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.467
STILL EVALUATING OUR OPTIONS

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:12.935
AND WE HAVE UNTIL NOVEMBER

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.737
SIXTEENTH TO RENDER A FINAL

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.273
DECISION. WHETHER WE WILL BE

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.441
PETITIONING THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.909
SUPREME COURT FOR REVIEW IN

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:22.845
THAT CASE. WELL I WILL NOT

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:25.314
COMMENT ON PENDING LITIGATION I

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.383
WILL STRESS THAT IN PARTNERSHIP

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.386
WITH THE RECEIVER WE CONTINUE

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.221
TO IMPLEMENT A VARIETY OF CODED

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:34.323
MITIGATION STRATEGIES AT SAN

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.458
QUENTIN AND THROUGHOUT OUR

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.660
SYSTEM. TO KEEP ALL THOSE WHO

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.962
WORK AND LIVE WITHIN OUR

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:43.132
FACILITY SAFE. AS OF TODAY SAN

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:46.068
QUINN HAS THREE POSITIVE CASES.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.671
WITH ELEVEN STAFF CASES OF I

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.272
THINK MR KELSO TALKED ABOUT THE

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:52.508
STATEWIDE NUMBER SO I WILL NOT

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:56.512
REITERATE THAT SO LET ME GO TO

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.647
TURN TO THE O. I. G. REPORT. WE

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.449
TAKE THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY I

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.718
WILL SAY KOBE REVOLVES AROUND

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.588
THE NATION AND WE PIVOTED- AS

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:08.290
FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THE EVER

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.627
AND- THE DEMANDS OF COBIT AND

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.729
HOW AND HOW WE RESPOND TO IT. I

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:14.630
WILL SAY NATIONALLY ARE

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.332
SCREENING DIRECTION WAS NOT

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.301
CLEAR. WE WERE FOCUSING ON THE

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.436
INMATE POPULATION WE'RE

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.304
FOCUSING ON OUR INTEREST IS A

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.006
SECURE PERIMETER AND THE

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.609
COLLECTING ARE- ADMINISTRATION

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.845
BUILDINGS. SO THAT WAS A

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:33.783
FAILURE- I WILL SAY THAT YOU

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.584
KNOW WITH MOST RECENT DIRECTION

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.953
AS FAR AS OUR SCREENING. ONE

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.722
POINT SEVEN TRENDS GENERALLY

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.791
OUT OF OUR OWN ENTRANCES AT OUR

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:44.293
GATES TO OUR FACILITIES HAS

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.996
PROVEN TO BE. DIABLE IN

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:49.432
IMPROPER SCREENING I WILL SAY

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:50.900
THAT OUR STATE OR SCREENING

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.768
MAJORITY OVER SPRING STUFF BY

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:56.038
BY NURSING STAFF. AND WE HAVE

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.506
EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTY

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.974
WITH INITIAL EQUIPMENT THAT WE

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.509
OBTAIN FOR THE NON CONTACT

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.311
THERMOMETERS WE'VE COME A LONG

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.979
WAY THERE WE'VE TRIED A VARIETY

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:06.248
OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. AND MOST

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:08.083
RECENTLY SELECTED EVEN IF A

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.820
BETTER OPTION WITH THE BETTER

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:12.788
BETTER BATTERY LIFE. SO WE HAVE

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.156
SINCE SINCE THAT REPORT

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:15.357
OBVIOUSLY DONE EXTENSIVE

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:17.059
TRAINING TO ALL OF OUR STAFF

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:19.962
PROVIDING SCREENING. OF THE

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.831
DOCUMENTATION IMPROVE FOR

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:25.568
PRACTICE ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.169
THE THERMOMETER ISSUE AS IT

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.804
RELATES TO BATTERY LIFE THAT

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.773
HAS SINCE I THINK RESOLVED-

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.007
STAFF KNOW HOW TO EXCHANGE

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:34.710
BATTERIES INTO. IMPROVE THE

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.312
BATTERY LIFE WE'VE WE'VE GONE

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.813
TO IT A NEW MODEL THAT WE'VE

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.282
TESTED AT- BUT FOR VERY

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.517
INSTITUTIONS AND WE ARE

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:44.553
ANTICIPATING- ADDITIONAL SUPPLY

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.454
EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:48.824
INSTITUTIONS WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:51.093
THAT THE NON TOUCH THE MONITORS

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.862
IT EVERYWHERE BUT WE ARE

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:55.064
ORDERING THESE ADDITIONAL UP

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:59.468
LONG BATTERY LIFE ONCE- AND

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.569
THREE. THE MOMENT WILL BE AT

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.104
EACH ENTRANCE POINTS OF OUR

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.907
INSTITUTIONS AND THEY WILL BE

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.643
DIRECTORSHIP TO OUR FACILITIES.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.480
GOES ON- THE SECOND REPORT OF

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:14.116
NON COMPLIANCE AS IT RELATES TO

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:18.187
WEARING FACIAL COVERINGS. I

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:20.089
WILL SAY THAT WE'VE INVOLVED IN

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:21.423
THIS AREA AS WELL INITIAL

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.425
DIRECTION WAS NOT CLEAR IT WAS

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.995
ALMOST A RECOMMENDATION VERSUS

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:28.797
BEING MANDATORY WE'VE COME A

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:31.033
LONG WAY WITH THAT- SETTING

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.068
VERY CLEAR EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.336
WE TAKE THIS VERY VERY

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.238
SERIOUSLY WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.640
ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION AND

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.009
SPREAD. OF THIS VIRUS AND MASS

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:42.845
MATTER. AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.414
VERY CLEARLY THAT BOTH RECEIVER

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.683
KELSO AND I HAVE TAKEN A VERY

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.652
FIRST STAND ON THIS ISSUE.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.820
THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE MEMOS OUT

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:54.490
TO STAFF SOME WHAT CONFUSING

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.358
FROM ONE MEMBER TO THE NEXT IT

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:59.728
JUST. WE WERE TRYING TO EVOLVE

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:02.498
AS CODED WAS INVOLVED THE AND

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:05.568
SOMETIMES IT WAS NOT CLEAR- AND

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.102
EVEN THE COMMUNITY AS WE ALL

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.571
KNOW THAT THAT HAS INVOLVED AS

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:13.442
WELL. SO MOST RECENTLY THE MOST

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.644
RECENT MEMOS DATED OCTOBER

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.947
TWENTY SEVENTH WHERE. IT'S NOT

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:21.183

THE REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.440
HAS BEEN FROM A VARIETY OF

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.743
REASONS ONE OF THE EARLY

WEARING FACE MASK IT HAS SINCE

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:28.283

WHEN THEY'RE RUN INTO AN ALARM

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:13.628

MEMOS. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:25.687
THAT EVERYBODY CLEARLY

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:27.155
UNDERSTOOD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:30.992
ANSWER. TO ASK QUESTIONS. OF

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.427
AND BOTH CLARK AND I FEEL

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.095
CONFIDENT THAT OUR MESSAGE WAS

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:35.930
LOUD AND CLEAR. BUT IT STILL

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:36.931
COMES BACK AND I'M NOT A

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:38.500
BELIEVER THE POINT. WE'RE STILL

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:39.534
NINE MONTHS INTO THIS AND WE'RE

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.802
STILL DOING ALL THIS STUFF.

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.470
WHICH SHOULD'VE OCCURRED QUITE

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.072
A BIT OF TIME AGO. BECAUSE WE

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.240
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IT

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.975
THROUGH ITS NEST AND HOSPITALS

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:47.742
AND- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.310
PRETTY TIGHT ON IT. EVEN THE

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.846
CAPITAL I MEAN. YOU JUST HAVE

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.114
TO CHECK GO TO WEAR MASKS. THE

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:54.582
LAWLER STUFF IS MIND NUMBING

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.684
BECAUSE- YOU HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:57.552
MULTIPLE FOR MONITORS OR THE

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:59.487
BATTERY GOES OUT. YOU'VE GOT.

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:01.256
TO DO THAT SO. SOME OF THE

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.891
STUFF I'M HEARING IS LAUGHABLE.

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.425
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T GET THEIR ACT

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.994
TOGETHER ON THIS. BECAUSE IF

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:06.794
YOU CAN SCREEN SOMEONE

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.096
ENTRANCED LIKE IF YOU HAVE A

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:09.330
FLASHLIGHT YOU HAVE EXTRA

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:10.565
BATTERIES IT'S JUST THINGS LIKE

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.334
THAT. WE'RE IT'S AND I WILL SAY

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.737
THIS. YOU KNOW I THINK C. R. C.

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:16.337
C. R. CONTRIBUTED SOME THESE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:19.307
ISSUES- I'M NOT GONNA BLAME YOU

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.842
WELL MAYBE I. DON'T KNOW. BUT

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:21.943
THROUGH THE- THROUGH

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.778
MANAGEMENT. AND IT THAT THAT

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:24.913
THAT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.548
PART THAT WE'RE IN THIS. AND

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.149
EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR A MASK AND

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:29.217
PERIOD IF THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:35.023
IF YOU DON'T. GET THERE'S GONNA

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:35.657
BE REPERCUSSIONS. BUT IT'S JUST

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:37.258
THAT'S FRUSTRATION. IS A LOT OF

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:38.326
COULD HAVE BEEN PER. WITH AND

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:39.294
EVEN DOWN THE TREE. OF THE

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.929
INMATES THAT WERE NEVER TESTED

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:44.899
IT'S JUST. IT IT'S SO SAD THIS

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.001
COMICAL NOTHING COMICAL. THAT

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.570
HOW WE CHANGE THIS AND REALLY

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.339
GET IT BACK- I THINK IT IS

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:52.407
TOUGH FOR YOU GUYS BECAUSE

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:53.875
YOU'RE FACILITIES. THE ACTUAL

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:56.177
PHYSICAL PLANT. YOU GOT A LOT

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:56.744
OF ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:58.546
CONDUCIVE FOR IT- THE

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:00.014
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR DO NOT

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.249
WANT TO BUILD PRISONS THEY

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:02.216
WANNA CLOSE PRISONS. THE

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.752
PROBLEM IS. WE'VE GOT A B. ONE

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:07.522
OH NINE PROP 47-57. WHEN YOU

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:08.623
KNOW AND I KNOW WHO'S LEFT IN

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:11.359
PRISON. VIA THE FENDERS. IS

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:15.830
THAT CORRECT. THERE WE CAN

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.966
PRODUCE SURE A TOTAL OF FULL

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.701
OUTBREAK OF OUR POPULATION BUT

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.836
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY NOT

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.706
NON- VIOLENT LIKE SAY SECOND

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.107
STRIKERS THAT WE HAVE IN THOSE

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.242
TYPE OF THINGS BUT FOR THE MOST

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:29.978
PART WE DO HAVE A FAIR NUMBER

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.312
OF VERY SERIOUS AND VIOLENT

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:32.780
OFFENDERS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.549
RIGHT. AND ALSO WE KNOW

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.584
OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME NONVIOLENT

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.819
CRIMES OR IF YOU'RE DOING A

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:39.587
WOMAN INTO HAVING A CHILD YOU

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.723
CONSIDER NON VIOLENT CRIMES BUT

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:45.093
IT STILL GOES BACK TO- IS MR

KELSO SAID THERE WILL BE MORE

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:47.996
OUTBREAKS AT SOME POINT LATER

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:50.465
ON AND HOW DO WE FIX THIS AND

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:51.966
WE DON'T FIX IT IN THE CURRENT

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:54.168
SET UP WITH PRISONS- THERE

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:55.370
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S OF THE

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:58.139
TECHNOLOGY IS LEAPT IS GONE BY

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.974
LEAPS AND BOUNDS. WHERE THEY

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.509
CAN BUILD MUCH BETTER FACILITY

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:04.045
BUT NO ONE WANTS TO DO IT SO- I

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:06.414

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:24.799
OPINION THEY HAVE TOO MUCH. SO

ARE- IN THE STATEWIDE

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.979
POPULATIONS- WE'VE SEEN

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:39.714
SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS WITH

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.183
EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AS

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:42.784
A RESULT OF THE LACK F SOCIAL

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.386
INTERACTION- IMPOSED BY SOME OF

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:46.988
OUR SHUT DOWNS- IN RESPONSE THE

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:48.556
PANDEMIC AND I'M WONDERING IF

YOU HAVE ANY DATA ABOUT THE

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:52.927
EFFECTS ON IN MADE THE MOTIONAL

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.629
MENTAL HEALTH THAT THE LACK OF

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.464
VISITATION HAS CAUSED AND I'M

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.532
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.767
THE- THE YOUTH TOWARD.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:03.304
POPULATION WELL AS FAR AS DATA

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:06.174
I MAY HAVE TO- DIFFER OR GET

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.642

DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF THERE'S

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.912
ACTUAL DATA I WILL JUST SAY IT

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.914
IS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.582
THAT OURVENDORS HAVE NOT HAD

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.851
FACE TO FACE VISITING. SINCE

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:20.054
MARCH. AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:21.589
THAT THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.025
IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HARDER.

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.761
WE'RE WORKING VERY VERY HARD WE

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:29.731
WERE HOPING TO OPEN UP FOR FACE

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.999
TO FACE VISITING. IN THE VERY

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.968
NEAR FUTURE AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:37.605
AS OF YESTERDAY. I WAS INFORMED

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.907
THAT THAT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.843
AND BASED ON HEALTH CARE'S

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.377
RECOMMENDATION PUBLIC HEALTH

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:46.080
RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ARE WORKING

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.583
VERY HARD VERY FAST TO GET AN

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:51.452
ELECTRONIC SOLUTION SIMILAR TO

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.554
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY.

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:56.190
FOR FAMILIES- I WILL SAY THAT

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:59.093
ON OUR JUVENILE SIDE WERE ABLE

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.962
TO IMPLEMENT THAT FAIRLY EARLY

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:02.530
ON A COVERT I COULDN'T RECALL

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.999
THE EXACT DATE I WANT TO SAY IT

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.801
WAS APRIL TIME FRAME MAYBE MAY

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.736
THE WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO DO

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.972
SKYPE BUSY NOW THEIR POPULATION

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:13.641
IS MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN OURS.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:17.011
BUT I HAVE GIVEN A REALLY HARD

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:19.080
DEADLINE THAT I EXPECT THIS IS

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.281
IT THIS SOON AS HUMANLY

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.717
POSSIBLE IF NOT IF I HAVE TO

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:23.684
REACH OUT TO ANOTHER STATE

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.353
AGENCY LIKE CALIFORNIA

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:27.221
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:28.956
SOME SUPPORT I'VE DEFINITELY

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:31.125
PREPARED TO DO THAT IF MY IF

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.727
INTERNALLY WE KEEP WE CANNOT

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.862
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET VISITING

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:37.098
I WILL SAY THAT OUR MENTAL

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.067
HEALTH. PARTNERS HAVE BEEN VERY

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:40.601
DILIGENT WITHIN OUR

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:43.771
INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:46.974
TO OUR OFFENDERS IN OUR CARE-

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.576
BECAUSE IT'S VERY IT'S- IT'S-

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:49.977
IT'S BEEN DRAMATIC I WILL SAY

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.445
WE WERE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.381
OUR PHONE CALLS. WE ALSO HAVE

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:56.450
FREE PHONE CALL DAYS. OF BY OUR

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:58.319
VENDOR THAT PROVIDES OUR PHONE

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.720
CALLS THEY OFFERED I WANT TO

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:00.888
SAY IT'S AN AVERAGE OF TWO DAYS

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.023
PER MONTH THAT I COULDN'T TELL

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:03.124
YOU EXACTLY WHICH DAYS THEY

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.725
ARE. BUT THEY'RE TOTALLY FREE

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.128
CALLS. AND SO THAT HAS

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:07.795
CERTAINLY HELPED THE

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.997
POPULATION. THAT WAS REALLY ONE

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.532
OF THE REASONS WHY WE CAME UP

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:12.934
WITH THE TWELVE WEEK POSITIVE

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.002
PROGRAMMING CREDIT. WAS TO

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:17.004
REALIZE THAT THE POPULATION HAS

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.440
BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.242
KOVIC YOU AND I ARE IMPACTED

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:25.179
EVERY DAY. BY NOT BY OUR DAY TO

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:28.850
DAY LIVES BUT THEY DON'T BUT WE

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:29.450
HAVE OUR FAMILIES THEY DON'T.

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.352
AND SO IT'S THAT WAS ONE OF OUR

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.954
THOUGHT PROCESSES THAT THEY

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:36.257
BEHAVED. THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.325
FAMILY THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:38.292
VISITS THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:39.393
PROGRAM IS THAT THEY WOULD

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.696
NORMALLY HAVE. IN SO THAT'S

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.231
WHERE WE KIND OF CAME UP WITH

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.832
THE WHOLE THOUGHT PROCESS OF

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.601
PASTA PROGRAMMING CREDIT. AND

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.870
SO IT'S SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.838
TO MY HEART. AND I WANT TO GET

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:51.973
IT FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.075
ENSURE. THAT FOR THE MIDDLE

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.476
HEALTH AS WELL AS JUST THEIR

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:57.812
BASIC WELL BEING- THE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.947
LONELINESS OF KOPET RIGHT

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:02.183
THAT'S A REALITY IT'S LONELY-

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.651
WHEN YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR NORMAL

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:05.253
LIFE SINCE SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:10.324
EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO BOB THANK

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.426

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.630
GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO AS WELL.

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:18.432
I'M WONDERING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:21.135
THE RESTRICTIONS ON VISITATION

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:21.903
OF SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.504
IMPLEMENTED TO TRY AND STOP THE

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.240
SPREAD OF. THE VIRUS FROM

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.608
OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTIONS INTO

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.543
THE INSTITUTIONS BUT- I'M

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:30.878
WONDERING OF RAPID TESTING HAS

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.680
BEEN LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBLE

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.115
SOLUTION TO GETTING. SOME

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.616
VISITATION GOING AGAIN BECAUSE

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.151
EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT FROM A

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.252
MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE THE MOST

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:39.854
ACCURATE OF TESTED SEEM LIKE TO

01:32:39.921 --> 01:32:44.058
BE A USEFUL SCREENING TOOL. TO

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:44.692
ALLOW THESE VISITATIONS TO TAKE

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:46.394
PLACE. I KNOW THAT WE'VE WORKED

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.828
VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.730
PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS AND WE

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:52.099
HAVE AMAZING STAFF I COLOR MY-

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:54.702
MY BFF MY BEST BEST FRIEND

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.404
FOREVER. BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN TO

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.739
KNOW OUR DOCTOR OUR SO WELL AND

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.107
I THINK SHE TESTIFIED LAST A

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:01.676
COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND SHE'S

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:03.277
PHENOMENAL. ALONG WITH DOCTOR

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:05.212

ADDRESSING THAT. AND I DID GET

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:10.551
THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.119
I'M NOT A 100% SURE IF THEY

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:14.221
LOOKED AT RAPID TESTING. I WILL

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:16.223
SAY THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.025
THE ANTIGENS THAT THE ACTUAL

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.428
TEST KITS THEMSELVES HAVE

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:22.263
SOMETIMES BEEN PROBLEMATIC TO

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:25.733
ATTAIN. A AND OPEN UP THOSE FOR

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.834

BUT- IF WE AGREE THAT. OUR GOAL

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.615
HERE IS REHABILITATION. THEN I

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:43.651

PANDEMIC SO I APPRECIATE- THE

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.514

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:31.899
TRANSFER. A CHALLENGE THAT YOU

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:32.533
HAVE AND IN PARTICULAR. AT SAN

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.901
QUENTIN BUT ALSO HOT AS IT

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:36.904
APPLIES TO OTHER. FACILITIES IT

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.139
SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'VE YOU'VE

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.674
OFFERED TRANSFER TO PEOPLE AND

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:42.810
THEY THEY DECLINE IT. AND I

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:43.444
UNDERSTAND THE SAN QUENTIN IS A

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.514
DESIRABLE- FACILITY FOR THE

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.182
INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF THE

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.116
ACCESS TO REHABILITATIVE

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.218
PROGRAMS. IS THE TRANSFERRED

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:53.721
DECLINE RATE AT SAN QUENTIN

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.489
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FACILITIES

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:58.993
OR OR- IS IT MORE IN LINE WITH

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.528
OTHER FACILITIES IN THE SYSTEM.

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:02.430
I WILL SAY WERE SUCH IN THE

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:04.298
INFANCY STAGE OF OFFERING THOSE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.033
TRANSFERS I DON'T THINK I COULD

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.902
BARELY ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:09.904
BUT AS WE GO FORWARD- I WILL

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:11.705
ENSURE THAT WE TRACK SOME DATA

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:15.109
ON THOSE. OKAY YEAH THANK YOU

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.545
WE'VE WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:18.712
YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO DOCTOR

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:22.450
BURKE. VERY EARLY ON YEARS AGO

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.919
COMMENTING ON HOW PRISON DESIGN

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.754
IS NOT MADE WITH A PUBLIC

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:30.091
HEALTH- PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:32.993
THERE CERTAINLY ARE INVESTMENTS

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.361
THAT MUST BE MADE AT PRISONS

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:35.763
LIKE FOLSOM AND SAN QUENTIN

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.631
THAT ARE ANTIQUATED- BUT ALSO

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:38.766
OTHER PRISONS THAT ARE MORE

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.334
DORM LIKE IN THEIR SETTING

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.838
WHICH- FROM A- PRISON

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.005
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE MAY BE

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:47.041
DESIRABLE IN IN MODERN

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:49.877
THINKING. AS OPPOSED TO HOW WE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:52.313
TREATED PEOPLE IN THE PAST WHAT

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.380
TYPE OF INVESTMENT WOULD NEED

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:58.786
TO BE MADE SYSTEM WIDE. TO YOU

01:35:58.853 --> 01:35:59.920
KNOW BETTER PREPARE FOR. AND

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:02.490
DOMINIC'S AND IN FACT JUST AT

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.291
TO RECOGNIZE THAT WERE NEVER

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:06.227
PROBABLY GONNA GO BACK TO A

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:09.663
NORMAL- WITH REGARD TO- HOW WE

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:10.998
NEED TO HOUSE PRISONERS THERE

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.067
AND BUT THE POPULATION OF THE

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:15.803
INCARCERATED SHOULD BE.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.571
OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID EARLIER I

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.273
DO THINK PHYSICAL PLANT MATTERS

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.841
YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SOCIALLY

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.376
DISTANCE WITHIN OUR FACILITIES

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.278
IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. YOU

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:27.381
KNOW I'M JUST. I WILL SAY THAT

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.049
FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT AT A

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.451
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:31.452
THOUSAND OFFENDERS WHEN CO THAT

01:36:31.519 --> 01:36:33.654
HIT. A TRIPLE BONTA GEMS AND

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:35.723
ALL OF OUR HOUSING UNITS. OF

01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:37.057
OUR OPEN DOOR HOUSING UNITS

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:39.360
SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:41.462
FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT THERE-

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:42.796
IN OUR POPULATION HAS

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.098
DRASTICALLY DROP SINCE

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:49.103
REALIGNMENT PROPOSITION. THIRTY

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:49.670
SIX FORTY SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN.

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:50.871
DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN OUR

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.907
POPULATION. SO THAT IS

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:58.245
FORTUNATE- I WILL SAY THAT- YOU

01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:00.181
KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOME LONG

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.049
TERM ASSESSMENTS ALL AS FAR AS

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.418
OUR FACILITIES. OF THE OPEN

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:07.588
CELL FRONT DESIGNS THE- VERSUS

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.223
ALL ITSELF FRONT WE KNOW THAT

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.759
THAT MATTERS IN A PANDEMIC- WE

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:14.862
ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW OPEN

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.730
DORM SETTINGS THAT. YOU KNOW IF

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:17.631
YOU CAN GET SOME DISTANCE IN

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:20.401
BETWEEN THAT MATTERS AS WELL SO

01:37:20.467 --> 01:37:21.635
OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THAT GOES INTO

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.837
CONSIDERATION AND IF THERE'S

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.806
ANY. IT STILL HAS TO BE

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.742
ASSESSED AS FAR AS OUR ABILITY

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:31.745
AND- YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:33.380
LIKE TO PLACE LIKE SEGWIT LET'S

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.583
SAY OR FULSOME. RIGHT I MEAN

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:38.152
MAYBE YOU YOU UTILIZE LOWER

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.787
RISK POPULATION. VERSUS A

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:42.289
HIGHER RISK MEDICAL POPULATION-

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:43.757
MAYBE THAT'S AN OPTION I MEAN

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.192
WE STILL HAVE TO EVALUATE ALL

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.595
THE OPTIONS GO GOING FORWARD

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:50.197
NOW WE HAVE SINCE STOPPED. ALL

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:51.699
HIGH RISK IN TAKEN TO SEGWIT

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:52.866
WITH EXAMPLE QUITS PROBABLY

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:55.002
STILL CLOSED. TO ANY KIND OF

01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:56.503
INTAKE BUT DEFINITELY HIGH RISK

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:57.538
MEDICAL INTAKE BECAUSE IT'S

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.173
REALLY THE COMBINATION OF HIGH

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.142
RISK MEDICAL. PLUS THE PHYSICAL

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:03.811
PLANT SO THAT'S REALLY THE

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:07.014
BIGGEST COMBINATION AND THEN.

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.816
DECISION MAKING SO FISCAL PLAN

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:10.351
TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THERE'S

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:12.086
NOT GOING TO BE ANY CHANGE AS

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.420
WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT BUDGET

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.289
CYCLE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:15.856
WE NEED TO PUT THOSE

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.591
INVESTMENTS- TO PROTECT PUBLIC

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:22.029
HEALTH. THOSE ARE STILL UNDER

01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:26.100
EVALUATION OKAY THANK YOU. THE

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:28.235
EARLY ON IT AND TO RAISE DR

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:29.536
BURKE'S NAME AGAIN I SPOKE WITH

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:31.905
HIM IN APRIL ASKING FOR SITE

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:34.275
SPECIFIC PLANS FOR ALL OF OUR

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.310
PRISON FACILITIES TO PLAN- IN

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:38.345
ANTICIPATION OF- AN OUTBREAK OF

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:40.014
KOBE NINETEEN WITHIN OUR PRISON

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.682
SYSTEM IN EACH OF THE THIRTY

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:44.251
FIVE FACILITIES. I WAS REFERRED

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:45.586
TO I THINK AN EIGHTY FOUR PAGE

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:47.087
SYSTEM WIDE PLAN BUT THERE IS

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:48.656
NOTHING SPECIFIC TO ANY

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:51.859
PARTICULAR FACILITY OR PRISON.

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:55.796
IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO I NEVER

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:58.699
REALLY HEARD OF ANY PLAN

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.302
ALTHOUGH I CALLED FOR IT-

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.804
PRETTY MUCH SHOT. INCESSANTLY

01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:07.107
SINCE APRIL UNTIL JULY WHEN

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:10.477
YES- LANDED UPON SAN QUENTIN

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:13.013
STATE PRISON AND CREATED- YOU

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.016
KNOW TENTS TO CREATE A SPACE

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:18.052
FOR PHYSICAL DISTANCE IN. AS

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.019
WELL AS A PLAN FOR AN ALTERNATE

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:20.287
CARE SITES TO ALLEVIATE

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:21.455
PRESSURE ON LOCAL HOSPITALS

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.390
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH. LEVEL OF

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.192
HOSPITALIZATION OF THE

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:28.262
INCARCERATED. IN LOCAL BAY AREA

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:31.832
HOSPITALS. AND SO IN IN THE

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.000
PRIOR CONVERSATION THIS TWO OF

MEASURED IN SIZE STOP AND THE

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:41.709

PLANS TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:53.187

AN ALTERNATE HOUSING SITE

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.309
FORTUNATELY THE MAJORITY OF OUR

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:17.444
GYM SPACES AROUND THE STATE

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:20.047

A POTENTIAL OPTIONS SO- THERE

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.489
ARE CONTINGENCY PLANS I WILL

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:31.492
SAY EARLY ON ALL OF US- WE'RE

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:32.826
ALL FOLLOWING THE CENTER FOR

IT RELATED TO- PRISONS AND

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.533
JAILS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM BUT I

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.168
WILL SAY THAT WE'VE EVEN LEARN

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:43.370
MORE. THAN WHAT THAT THAT

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.572
ORIGINAL GUIDANCE HAT AND MANY

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:47.441
STATES LOOK TO US FOR THE

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.109
LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED I

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:51.178
GET CALLS FREQUENTLY. ON HOW

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:53.046

HI YOU SECOND. ON ONE OF THE

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.894
ISSUES THAT REALLY WAS A

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.563
CONCERN EARLY ON THIS IS WHY I

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.999
SPOKE WITH CDCR IN APRIL AND

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:15.135
KEPT ON WAVING- WARNING FLAGS

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:17.704
ABOUT THIS WAS THE- CONCERN FOR

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.139
HOSPITALIZATION NOT JUST

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:20.841
BECAUSE OF AN OUTBREAK IN

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:21.942
PRISONS BUT SO THAT WAS A

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:24.111
CONCERN NATIONWIDE ABOUT MAKING

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:25.212
SURE THAT WE HAD ENOUGH I SEE

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:27.881
USE ENOUGH. VENTILATORS THIS

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:30.484
WAS A MASSIVE CONCERN GLOBALLY

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:33.053
AND- AND SO ALONG WITH

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.055
MEASURING FOR TENTS AND CARE

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:38.826
SITES AND QUARANTINE- IT'S

01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:40.060
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.295
THERE'S A HOSPITALIZATION PLAN

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:45.165

HOSPITALIZATION FOR EACH OF THE

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:03.517
THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. I WOULD

UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVITY OF THE

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:59.499
SITUATION- THAT NIGHT AS PEOPLE

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:03.570
WERE COMING IN- ON THE BUSES

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.639
SYMPTOMATIC. AND WITH THE

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:08.108
KNOWLEDGE THAT TESTS HAD NOT

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:10.377
OCCURRED FOR WEEKS. AND THE

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:13.847
DANGER THAT THIS SPARK. WOULD

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.817
CREATE AT THE DISTANT

01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:19.086
INCREDIBLE AN UNMANAGEABLE

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:21.221
WILDFIRE IN FACT DR WILSON'S

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:23.190

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:32.065
BEHIND MY EARLY CALLS FOR

PLANNING BACK IN APRIL BECAUSE

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:36.903
WE UNDERSTOOD HOW CODE NINETEEN

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.772
COULD SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE AND

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:40.841
SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.876
PUSH BACK MR KELSO ON YOUR

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:45.412

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:48.281
PROTOCOLS- IN UNDERSTANDING OF

01:44:48.348 --> 01:44:51.585
WHETHER OR NOT- VAPOR DROPLETS

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:55.355
VERSUS- SOLICITATION- WERE

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:57.691
UNDERSTOOD WELL BECAUSE WHEN I

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.625

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:05.499

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:07.701
WELL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.970

YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT ON THE

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.974
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:17.544
THROUGH MARCH APRIL MAY. JUNE

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.946
PERHAPS I THINK WHAT THE RECORD

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:22.783
SHOWS IS THAT THERE WERE

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:26.620
GLOBALLY- ONLY ISOLATED-

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:29.322
EXAMPLES WHERE YOU COULD SAY

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:31.291
WELL THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BY

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:33.360
DROPLETS SPREAD. I THINK

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:34.895
EVERYBODY MAY RECALL THERE WAS

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:37.164
A ON AN EXAMPLE OF A SPREAD IN

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:40.867
A RESTAURANT. WHERE THE PERSON

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:43.070
WENT UP AFFECTED WAS. ACROSS

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:47.274
THE RESTAURANT AND I HAD

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.308
OTHERWISE HAD NO CONTACT. BUT

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:50.110
THE NOTION OF SUPERSPRINT OR

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.912
EVENTS I WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:57.718
WAS BEING- DISCUSSED WIDELY- IN

01:45:57.784 --> 01:46:01.755
MARCH APRIL MAY UP. AND I GUESS

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:05.392
ALTHOUGH WHAT I. IT'S FAIR FOR

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:08.028
ME TO SAY I DIDN'T MAKE THIS UP

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:10.764
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE- THE

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:12.766
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE SPREAD OF

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:15.368
CODE I'M RELYING UPON AND WAS

01:46:15.435 --> 01:46:18.038
THEN RELYING UPON ADVICE OF OUR

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:20.340
TOP MEDICAL LEADERSHIP.

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.374
INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH

01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:23.477
EXPERTS- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.779
THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:27.748
POSSIBILITY OF AEROSOL SPREAD.

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.449
OUT BUT I SIMPLY DON'T- MY

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:30.584
RECOLLECTION IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:32.652
YOURS- MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.755
AT LEAST AS OF MAY THAT WAS NOT

01:46:34.821 --> 01:46:36.556
SOMETHING THAT WAS WIDELY

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:41.094
RECOGNIZED- IN ANY EVENT- THE

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:42.763
WEATHER WAS OR WAS NOT WIDELY

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:45.065
RECOGNIZED WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:47.768
QUENTIN I WAS A DISASTER AND I

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:49.936
THINK YOU AND I AGREE ON ON

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:52.506
THAT- AND WE NEED TO LEARN THE

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:54.708
LESSONS FROM THAT. UP GOING

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:56.009
BACK YOUR HOSPITALIZATION

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.344
QUESTION THE QUICK ANSWER THERE

01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:59.279
IS YES WE HAVE FOR EACH

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:02.048
INSTITUTION THEY UNDERSTAND

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:05.819
WHERE. THEIR HOSPITAL RESOURCES

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:09.322
ARE. EVEN WITH CENTERPOINT THE

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:10.824
FOR THAT WE MOVE TO A HOUSE UP

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:13.160
ALONG THE I. EIGHTY CORDER-

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:14.995
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:17.397
PART OF A- OF A PLAN FOR WHEN

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:18.565
YOU HAVE THIS NUMBER OF

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:20.066
HOSPITALIZATIONS YOU DON'T

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:22.903
WANNA OVER BURDEN- EVERYBODY IN

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:25.205
THE BAY AREA. YOU HAVE TO START

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:28.475
MOVING UP THE CORNER- MA'AM WE

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:30.043
MONITOR AVAILABILITY OF

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:33.713
HOSPITAL BEDS AND ICU BEDS ARE

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.982
PRETTY MUCH ON A DAILY BASIS-

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:37.751
BECAUSE THAT IS A LIMITING

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:41.221
RESOURCE- THAT WE SHARE WITH

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:43.423
THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THANK

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.724
YOU MISTER CALCITE I'LL JUST

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.092
CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK ON THE

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:47.360
IDEA THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:48.295
WE NEED TO DO MORE FREQUENT

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:50.497
TESTING AND THAT SAN QUENTIN

YOUR BOARD THAT I THINK IS

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:08.935
IF WE HAD TO DO MOVES AND DO

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:10.436
YOU CAN UTILIZE FORCE IN ORDER

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:12.738
TO DO THOSE MOVES. RIGHT THAT

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:15.641
ALSO BECOMES DANGEROUS AND SO

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:17.476
RIGHT NOW AND I'M ELECT CLARK

02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:20.212
SPEAK TO IT. BUT THE DECISION

02:00:20.279 --> 02:00:22.248
WAS MADE TO AFFORD THEM AN

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.383
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE WE DON'T

02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.618
KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF ANY

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:27.153
REFUSAL RIGHT THAT'S WHY I

02:00:27.219 --> 02:00:29.021
THOUGHT. EARLIER COMMENT WAS

02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:31.190
WELL WILL TAKE AND WE NEED TO

02:00:31.257 --> 02:00:33.025
COLLECT DATA ON THOSE REFUSALS

02:00:33.092 --> 02:00:34.961
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:37.363
THOSE REFUSALS. SHORT OF

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.265
UTILIZING FORCE TO DO IT BUT

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.233
BEING I GUESS IT COMES BACK TO

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.002
BEING NINE MONTHS INTO THIS. AT

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:43.869
SOME POINT THE REST OF THE

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:44.870
ACCOUNTABILITY SOMEONE'S GONNA

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.572
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:50.242
HAPPENED TO IT IN. RIGHT NOW.

02:00:50.309 --> 02:00:52.545
RAMOS MIDWAY NOVEMBER. SO RAMOS

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:54.413
IS THIS SOME POPULOUS INTO THIS

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.315
AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO TAKE

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:59.852
A DOG CHASING ITS TAIL.

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:00.419
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IF I

02:01:00.486 --> 02:01:07.827
MIGHT. THE VIDEO- THE REASON TO

02:01:07.893 --> 02:01:10.262
DO THE MOVES OUT OF DORMS AND A

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:12.098
SAFER HOUSING IS NOT BECAUSE

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:15.501
THAT'S GOING TO SLOW THE SPREAD.

02:01:15.568 --> 02:01:16.702
THE REASON TO THE MOVIES

02:01:16.769 --> 02:01:18.371
BECAUSE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:22.408
PATIENTS IT IMPROVES THEIR IT

02:01:22.475 --> 02:01:27.179
REDUCES THEIR RISK OF DEATH.

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:27.813
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE MOVE IS

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:29.215
VERY MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH

02:01:29.281 --> 02:01:33.419
CARE DECISION BY EACH PATIENT

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:36.022
AND IN CDC ARE- WE ARE VERY

02:01:36.088 --> 02:01:38.057
PROTECTIVE OF LETTING OUR

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:40.059
PATIENTS A MAKE THEIR OWN

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:41.661
HEALTH CARE DECISIONS UNDER AND

02:01:41.727 --> 02:01:45.631
THEN. CONSENT RATIONALE NOW I

02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:47.533
THINK IF IT TURNS OUT THAT

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.934
ALMOST NOBODY WANTS TO DO A

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.836
MOVIE WE WILL RECONSIDER

02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:52.238
WHETHER A BILL SHOULD BE

02:01:52.304 --> 02:01:55.808
VOLUNTARY OR NOT. OR FOR

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:58.377
EXAMPLE IN SAND POINT WHERE AT

02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:00.346
THIS POINT THE COURT ORDER SAYS

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:01.380
YOU NEED TO REDUCE THE

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:05.151
POPULATION TO UP SLOW THE

02:02:05.217 --> 02:02:06.519
SPREAD OF. WELL THE SET HAS

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:08.020
MOVED OUT OF SAN QUENTIN MIGHT

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:10.022
PRESENT A DIFFERENT. THE

02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:12.591
RATIONALE WHERE THERE IT MAY BE

02:02:12.658 --> 02:02:15.027
THE INVOLUNTARY MOVES MAKE A

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:17.096
GREATER DEAL OF SENSE BUT BUT

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.497
THAT'S WHY WE STARTED WITH THE

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.099
NOTION OF INVOLUNTARY AYE I

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:23.302
SHOULD ALSO ADD- WE NEED TO BE

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:24.937
DOING THINGS OF THAT. GENERATE

02:02:25.004 --> 02:02:28.007
TRUST THAT OUR PATIENTS WILL

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:30.676
TRUST US WHEN WE SAY THIS IS

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:33.612
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND IT

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:35.715
SEEMS TO US THAT MAKING THIS

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.550
THIS PROGRAM VOLUNTARY IS A WAY

02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:38.651
OF HELPING TO BUILD SOME

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:40.920
UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST. AND

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:41.921
THAT'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUSLY

02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:43.956
IMPORTANT ONE OF AXING COMES

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:46.625
ON- BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.394
TO HAVE TO OVERCOME RESISTANCE.

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:50.096
THAT EXISTS WITHIN OUR PATIENT

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:53.265
POPULATION TO TAKING VACCINES.

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:55.935

WITHIN ALSO THE PUBLIC WHERE

WE'VE KNOWN FOR NOT JUST WEEKS

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:42.594
BUT MONTHS THAT WEARING MASKS

02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:44.830
ARE CRITICAL TO STOPPING THE

02:06:44.897 --> 02:06:48.400

02:07:13.058 --> 02:07:15.594
CLEAR TO THIS PARTICULAR AGENCY

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:18.330
AND WHY IN YOUR OPINION IT

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:24.136

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:33.512
AREA THAT WE THE TIME PERIOD

02:07:33.579 --> 02:07:35.214
THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS A

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.583
PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD AND I

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:39.752
WANT TO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:43.822
HAS EVOLVED SINCE THEN. BOB BUT

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:46.959
OF WHAT WE FOUND HIM AND ALL I

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:49.628

JULY. TWENTY TWENTY. OUR OUR

02:08:05.644 --> 02:08:09.014
METHODOLOGY NECESSARILY

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:10.149

DATA TIME PERIOD AND THEN DRAW

02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:14.620
THE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:21.527
DATA IS TELLING US SO. WE WERE

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:25.097
AWARE AND HONESTLY I THINK THE

02:08:25.164 --> 02:08:27.266
DEPARTMENT WAS AWARE THAT THE

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:30.769
ONLY GIRL IN THEIR QUIVER FOR-

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.704
THAT WAS THAT WAS PROVEN TO

02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:35.541
HELP STOP THE SPREAD WAS THE

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:39.144
WEAR MASKS HOWEVER I DON'T

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:42.514
BELIEVE THAT THE- US DEPARTMENT

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:45.517
MANAGEMENT- I KNOW THAT THE

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:46.251
THAT THE HEADQUARTERS

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:49.388
LEADERSHIP. UNDERSTOOD THIS BUT

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:50.923
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT EVER GOT

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:54.426
DOWN TO THE LOCAL SUPERVISORS

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:59.098
AT- AT AND THE WORDS THAT THIS

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:02.101
WAS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT THEY

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:06.038
NEEDED TO RESOLVE IN FACT ONE

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:07.239
COMMENT WE HAVE. AND I'LL READ

02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:11.477
IT- ONE COMMENT FROM A STAFF

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:13.545
MEMBER AT ONE OF THE PRISONS IN

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:15.681
RESPONSE TO OUR SURVEY WAS THE

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.516
MAJORITY OF CUSTODY STAFF

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:19.818
REFUSED TO WEAR PP EVAN WHEN

02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:20.285
THIS WAS REPORTED TO

02:09:20.352 --> 02:09:22.287
SUPERVISORS THEIR REPEATED

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:24.656
RESPONSE WAS THAT THE MANDATES

02:09:24.723 --> 02:09:26.959
WERE UNDER FOR UNENFORCEABLE.

02:09:27.025 --> 02:09:30.462
BECAUSE THESE WERE ADULTS. HI I

02:09:30.529 --> 02:09:34.199
AM AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:37.302
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE- HAVE

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:40.706
GENERATED- A MORE SERIOUS

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:45.711
RESPONSE BUT IN FACT EVEN IN

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:47.846
SOME TO SOME OF THE WORDS THAT

I SPOKE PERSONALLY TO. THEY

02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:53.118
DIDN'T TAKE THE SAME THEY DID

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:55.020
TAKE THIS UP WITH THE SAME

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:57.489
SERIOUSNESS THAT I THINK A LOT

02:09:57.556 --> 02:10:00.626
OF THE- OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:03.295

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:05.764
WHO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE-

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:11.303
TOOK IT- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:16.742
THERE WAS. OF A LOT OF.

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:18.510
UNDERSTANDING OR ACCEPTANCE

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:20.779
THAT MASKS WERE AN IMPORTANT

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:25.617
PART OF THIS. AND OF. I DON'T

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:27.019

RESULTS BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.792
BEGIN TO WATER. ONE SECOND

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:34.793

BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE-

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:47.372

GROVE US. ON IT IS IT IS IT IN

02:10:50.375 --> 02:10:52.644
YOUR OPINION. THAT THE

ENFORCING RULES WITH ADULTS. NO

02:10:58.617 --> 02:10:59.685

02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:01.620
THINK THEY DO I THINK THERE ARE

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:04.523
SOME. ISSUES THAT THEY ARE VERY

02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:07.626
CLEAR AND VERY ABLE TO ENFORCE.

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:09.928
ARE THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.964
THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T LOOK AT

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:14.533
WITH THE SAME SERIOUSNESS THAT-

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.567
THAT WE MIGHT LOOK AT IT MY

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:19.538
OFFICE FOR. SO RIGHT. MY

02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:20.973

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:28.146
THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:31.617
OF RULES IF YOU GO TO PRISON

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:34.286
BECAUSE FREEDOM IS RESTRICTED

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.421
NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE. GOTTEN

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:38.991
INCREASE LIBERTY YOU'VE YOU

LOSS OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM SO

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:43.161
I AM STILL TRYING TO

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:48.734
UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS MAJOR

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.038
RULED THAT WE ENFORCE OF THE

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:54.606
PUBLIC RIGHT WITH IF THE PUBLIC

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:55.874
WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:57.876
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WHICH THEY

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.978
HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO. IF THEY

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:01.847
WANT TO DO IT IN PERSON.

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.348
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COME

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:04.850
INTO THE CAPITOL BUILDING

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:08.487
WITHOUT A MASK. AND THAT HAS AS

02:12:08.553 --> 02:12:11.123
AS SOON AS WE CAME BACK AND

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:12.924

PEOPLE DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY

02:12:36.348 --> 02:12:38.984
WHETHER THE WARDENS AS WELL AS

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:39.718
THE SUPERVISORS AT THE

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:42.187
FACILITIES DIDN'T WANT TO AMASS

02:12:42.254 --> 02:12:45.691
PERIOD. BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:47.759
DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE IN FORCING

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:52.030
RULES IN FACT IN MY EXPERIENCE

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:54.966
WITH THE FACILITIES ON THE

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:56.535
RULES ARE CREATED TO PROTECT

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:58.904
PEOPLE'S SAFETY THE SAFETY OF

02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:01.606
BOTH THE OFFICERS THE STAFF BUT

02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:04.042
ALSO OF THE INMATES AND SO YOU

02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:06.244
HAVE SOMETHING THAT AGAIN. WE

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:07.446
WERE ASKING PEOPLE TO WEAR A

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:09.881
MASK BECAUSE IT WAS FASHIONABLE

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:11.216
OR SOMETHING IT WAS IT WAS FOR

02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:13.418
PEOPLE'S PHYSICAL HEALTH AND

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:18.023
SAFETY. SO HI I CAN ONLY COME

02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:19.858
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT. THEY

02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:24.629
DON'T DO IT. WELL I'LL I WOULD

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:26.732
BE IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:31.136
WOULD PROBABLY- MIRROR WHAT

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:33.205
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER- NOTED

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.207
EARLIER IS THAT THESE WORDS

02:13:35.273 --> 02:13:39.077
HAVE. A LOT OF DISCRETION THAT

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:42.114
IS GRANTED TO THEM THROUGH FROM

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:45.283
THE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP AND-

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.953
WHAT THAT LEADS TO. IS IN SOME

02:13:48.019 --> 02:13:49.621
INSTANCES THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:52.391
WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND THIS

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:55.627
WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.295
DID NOT RECEIVE. A LOT OF

02:13:57.362 --> 02:14:03.201
HEADQUARTERS- NOTICES UNTIL

02:14:03.268 --> 02:14:05.937
JUST VERY RECENTLY. WHEN YOU

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:06.938
SEE RECENTLY WOULD YOU TALK

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:09.141
ABOUT LIKE LAST WEEK LAST MONTH

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:11.977
I'M TALKING LAST WEEK- WE WERE

02:14:12.043 --> 02:14:13.578
OUT AND WE WERE OUT OF IT

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:17.783
INSTITUTION- ON MONDAY

02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:25.290
YESTERDAY. FOR MONDAY AND- WE-

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:26.958
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:29.895
WARDEN WHO. WHO THEN TOLD US IT

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:32.597
WAS NOW CRYSTAL CLEAR TO HIM

02:14:32.664 --> 02:14:35.634
WHAT HIS JOB WHAT'S- AND THAT

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:40.705
WAS MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR. BY THE

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.974
BY THE SECRETARY AND THE

02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:45.911
RECEIVER WHO LEFT THEM NO DOUBT

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:48.880
WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS WERE I

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:49.481
DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAPPENED

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:53.051
EARLY ON. SO I KNOW THAT THIS

02:14:53.118 --> 02:14:54.920
ISSUE VERY MASS IS BEING BEEN A

02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:56.721
POLITICAL ISSUES IN OTHER PARTS

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:57.589
OF THE COUNTRY I REALLY

02:14:57.656 --> 02:14:59.591
APPRECIATE OUR STATE I MEAN. IT

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:02.260
HAS NOT BEEN AT LEAST AT LEAST

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:02.894
JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION IS NOT

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:07.199
BEEN. OF POLITICAL- SITUATION

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:10.135
IN OUR- IN OUR GOVERNOR OUR

02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:12.437
STATE GOVERNMENT- WE- WE

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:14.773
OBVIOUSLY HAVE. DIFFERENCES OF

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:17.609
OPINION ABOUT OPENING UP AND

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:18.877
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER TURNS

02:15:18.944 --> 02:15:20.512
YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY AND I

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:22.981
THINK THOSE ARE ALL- EXTRA

02:15:23.048 --> 02:15:24.015
THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:15:24.082 --> 02:15:25.317
DELIBERATE AND HEALTH POLICY

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:26.952
DISCUSSIONS BUT REALLY THOUGH

02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:29.521
THE WORD OF THE MASS HASN'T

02:15:29.588 --> 02:15:31.189
BEEN. OUT A MAJOR POLITICAL

02:15:31.256 --> 02:15:35.460
ISSUE- BUT I. I MEAN I COME TO

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:36.127
COULD I CAN ONLY COME TO

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.262
CUSHION I AGREE WITH YOU I

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:39.030
THINK THE WARDENS HAVE. AN

02:15:39.097 --> 02:15:41.867
IMMENSE AUTHORITY EACH OF THEM.

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:46.304
AND IF THEY- WARRANT- ENFORCING

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:49.741
THE PROTOCOLS. I CAN ONLY SORT

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.676
OF IMAGINE THAT THEY JUST.

02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:53.144
AGAIN COME TO CONCLUSION THAT

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:55.847
IT DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT IN THIS

02:15:55.914 --> 02:15:58.817
SEEMS GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNOR-

02:15:58.884 --> 02:16:00.452
YOU KNOW SENSE COVERT STARTED

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:02.087
HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN ON TV

02:16:02.153 --> 02:16:03.321
EVERY DAY EVERY OTHER DAY EVERY

02:16:03.388 --> 02:16:04.856
THREE DAYS. AND ONE OF HIS

02:16:04.923 --> 02:16:06.525
CONTINUING MESSAGES TO THE

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:08.393
PUBLIC INCLUDING ALL THE STATE

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:10.295
AGENCIES BUT JUST TO THE PUBLIC

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:12.631
HAS BEEN TO WEAR A MASK- THE

02:16:12.697 --> 02:16:14.332
SUIT SO WHY DO YOU THINK IT

02:16:14.399 --> 02:16:15.867
TOOK SO LONG FOR THE

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:21.273
DEPARTMENT. MANAGEMENT TO COME.

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:22.107
DELIVER THE MESSAGE THE

02:16:22.173 --> 02:16:23.275
GOVERNOR'S BEEN DELIVERING

02:16:23.341 --> 02:16:25.243
PRETTY MUCH SENSE I DON'T KNOW

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:29.447
ROUGHLY MARCH OR APRIL. WELL IN

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:32.551
IT IN FAIRNESS TO THE

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:34.119
DEPARTMENT THEY'RE DEALING WITH

02:16:34.185 --> 02:16:37.656
A LOT OF WITH THE OUTBREAKS AND

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:39.457
SO FORTH BUT I THINK THEY

02:16:39.524 --> 02:16:41.526
SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE. OF THE

02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:42.861
WHERE WITH ALL FOR WHATEVER

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:45.397
REASON TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:49.401
AND NOW THAT SOME ATTENTION HAS

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:53.371
BEEN. FOCUSED ON IT AND WAS

02:16:53.438 --> 02:16:56.341
FOCUSED BECAUSE OF THE HOW THE

02:16:56.408 --> 02:16:59.010
RESULTS THAT WE REPORTED I

02:16:59.077 --> 02:17:02.080
THINK THAT THEY HAVE OF.

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:03.348
THEY'LL COME TO THE CONCLUSION

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:04.883
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:07.619
REQUIRES SOME- UPPER LEVEL

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:09.387
LEADERSHIP INVOLVEMENT AND

02:17:09.454 --> 02:17:14.726
THAT'S HAPPENING WE'RE WE ARE

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:16.695
WE WILL WE NEED TO SEE WHETHER

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:23.768
THAT STICKS BUT- AT THIS POINT-

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:25.570
I THINK THAT BASED ON THE

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:27.105
INFORMATION THAT WE PRESENTED

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:29.240
OUR REPORT. WE HAVE THE

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:31.576
ATTENTION OF THE LEADERSHIP AT

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:34.980
THE DEPARTMENT AND HALF CCH YES

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:38.883
AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:43.955
DRIVE SOME OF THESE. SOME OF

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:45.390
THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE POLICIES

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:49.127
WHICH ARE THERE. IT'S SO SOUNDS

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:51.596
LIKE YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:52.998
FEELING OR I'M JUST

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.032
PARAPHRASING WHAT I HEARD YOU

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:58.970
SAY. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT RE

02:17:59.037 --> 02:18:02.107
OR SORT OF RE ITERATING THE

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:05.610
FACE COVERING PROTOCOLS LAST

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:08.613
WEEK WERE A DIRECT RESULT OF

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:10.849
YOUR REPORT AND YOUR YOUR

02:18:10.915 --> 02:18:17.288
INVESTIGATION I. I DON'T KNOW

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:20.058
FOR SURE BUT- I HAVE HAD

02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:21.793
SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WE'RE

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:24.863
SECRETARY ALISON ABOUT THE

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:28.066
RESULTS THAT WE FOUND. AND

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:30.669
WE'VE HAD GOOD DISCUSSIONS

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:32.671
ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:38.009
AND I THINK THAT- WHAT THE

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:39.644
SECRETARY AND THE RECEIVER DID

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.312
LAST FRIDAY AND THEIR

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:43.615
DISCUSSION WITH THE WARDENS WAS

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:46.251
A DIRECT RESULT OF SORT OF

02:18:46.317 --> 02:18:48.019
HEARING THIS DRUMBEAT OF THIS

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:49.888
IS ONE THING YOU CAN DO IT IT'S

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.890
NOT BEING ENFORCED. I'M IN AND

02:18:51.956 --> 02:18:54.359
WHOSE WHOSE PURVIEW IS THIS

02:18:54.426 --> 02:18:55.760
HELP ME CLARIFY IS IT THE

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:57.796
RECEIVERS PURVIEW. BECAUSE OF

02:18:57.862 --> 02:19:00.331
THE HEALTH RELATED MATTER WAS A

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:02.701
REALLY THE SECRETARY'S PARTY

02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:03.735
YES I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:05.437
THEM BUT I WOULD THINK THAT IS

02:19:05.503 --> 02:19:08.540
A JOINT PURVIEW THE- OF THE

02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:13.078
SECRETARY CLEARLY HAS.

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:16.715
AUTHORITY FOR THE CUSTODY STAFF

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:18.616
IN THOSE PRISONS THE RECEIVER

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:20.785
CLEARLY HAS SOME AUTHORITY FOR

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:24.255
THE HEALTH CARE PEOPLE- AND

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:27.092
THAT. THAT PRISON POPULATION OF

STAFF IS A IS A MIXTURE OF

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.296
THOSE SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK

02:19:31.362 --> 02:19:32.130
IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:35.066

INSPECTIONS START. THEY JUST

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:58.449
BEGAN WITH THE LAST COUPLE

02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:25.176
PREVIOUS TO A FEW WEEKS AGO I

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:27.345
FOR EXAMPLE WE HEARD THE SAME

02:26:27.411 --> 02:26:29.113
SITUATION WITH THE NURSING

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.149

ON THE- THE STATE SET UP A

02:26:33.885 --> 02:26:35.286
STRIKE TEAM AND THEY HAVE

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:37.555
STRIKE TEAMS THAT WERE-

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:40.091

THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN. NURSING

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:55.740
HOMES WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:57.141
SPIKE OF. LOADED WITH IN THE

02:26:57.208 --> 02:26:59.810
STATE JUST LIKE THE- PRISONS

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:02.580
ARE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY- IT

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.515

THAT. PROTOCOLS ARE BEING

02:27:10.388 --> 02:27:11.522
FOLLOWED ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.658
WAS. THE BASIC ONE POINT WHERE

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:20.031
I MASS. RIGHT I WILL SAY THAT.

02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:21.732
AS IT HAS EVOLVED ALL THE

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:23.634
VARIOUS MEMOS WE CAN SEARCH BY

02:27:23.701 --> 02:27:26.704
G. COPIES OF THE I THINK FIVE

02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:27.972
POSSIBLY MORE I BELIEVE THE

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:30.641
MEMBERS WERE THERE I'M JUST NOT

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:31.142
BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:34.212
IMPLEMENTED. IT HONESTLY WHEN

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:36.380
YOU READ THAT L. Y. G. REPORT

02:27:36.447 --> 02:27:40.017
YOU REALIZE THAT. SO YOU'RE

02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:41.652
LOOKING FOR SYSTEMIC FAILURE IN

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.955
A IN A IN A IN A DEPARTMENT- I

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:45.590
WILL SAY AT MOST INSTITUTIONS I

02:27:45.656 --> 02:27:47.291
TOWARD I HAVE NOT SEEN OR

02:27:47.358 --> 02:27:49.961
WITNESSED ANY- DIRECT CONCERNS

02:27:50.027 --> 02:27:51.996
SYSTEMICALLY RIGHT MEANING LIKE

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:54.265
THE MAJORITY STAFF REFUSING TO

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.700
WEAR MASKS AND I'VE GONE

02:27:55.766 --> 02:27:56.300
INSTITUTIONS IN REMOTE

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:58.569
LOCATIONS. WHERE YOU KNOW THE

02:27:58.636 --> 02:27:59.837
SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:00.905
CO THAT OUR COMMUNITY THAT

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:02.607
NEVER BEEN HIT BY COBIT BUT OUR

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:03.674
STAFF WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY TO

02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:05.042
WHERE THE IT TOOK TO WEAR

02:28:05.109 --> 02:28:08.579
MASKS. SO I WILL SAY THAT TOO I

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:10.414
THINK IT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUE

02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:12.650
MAYBE EARLY ON YES BUT I WILL

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:15.453
SAY AS AS TIME ROLLED ON AND

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.488
ARE FURTHER EXPANSIONS OF KOBE

02:28:17.555 --> 02:28:19.023
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENTS KINDA

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:20.791
LATE IN IN ACTUALLY GETTING

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:24.295
CODED. YOU KNOW. MASS OUTBREAK

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:26.230
THAT WE SEEN WE WERE SEATED

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:28.599
CHAU WAS OBVIOUSLY OUR FIRST-

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:31.068
AND I. WOULD NOT BEEN THERE BUT

02:28:31.135 --> 02:28:34.705

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:37.742
LOST IN MY THOUGHTS HERE SAYS

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:40.444
GIVES ME. I WILL SAY THAT THE-

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:42.280
IG REPORT HIGHLIGHTED VERY

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:43.714
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT COULD BE

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:45.883
ADDRESSED AND THOSE HAVE BEEN

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:48.386
ADDRESSED NOW MANY OF THEM HAD

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:49.353
BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED IN

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.355
SOME MEMORANDUM. BUT I WILL SAY

02:28:51.422 --> 02:28:54.625
THAT WITH- EMPHASIS ON THOSE

02:28:54.692 --> 02:28:56.060
YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE MANAGERS

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:57.728
AND SUPERVISORS RESPONSIBLE TO

02:28:57.795 --> 02:29:00.364
ENSURE COMPLIANCE. LOCALLY WE

02:29:00.431 --> 02:29:02.066
TOOK THAT OUT YOU KNOW WE NOW

02:29:02.133 --> 02:29:04.402

02:29:30.761 --> 02:29:32.163
VISIT FACILITY EVERYONE SORT OF

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:34.332
ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR. SO I

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:35.366
DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY A

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:37.301
TRUE INDICATION AS TO WHAT IS

02:29:37.368 --> 02:29:38.536
REALLY GOING ON I DON'T THINK I

02:29:38.602 --> 02:29:40.404
CAN VISIT ANY FACILITY AND

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:42.406
REALLY GET US REAL IDEA OF.

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:44.175
WHAT'S GOING ON ON A DAY TO DAY

02:29:44.241 --> 02:29:45.009
BASIS I DON'T APPLY TO GET

02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:45.810
EVERYBODY ON THEIR BEST

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:47.611
BEHAVIOR AND- EVERYTHING'S BEEN

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:51.048
CLEANED AND XCERRA. SO I

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:53.617
THOUGHT I WOULD URGE YOU TO-

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:55.586
YOU KNOW EXPAND THAT TEAM THAT

02:29:55.653 --> 02:29:58.456
IS GOING AROUND AND- DOING

02:29:58.522 --> 02:30:03.094
VISIS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:06.197
THAT THERE IS- YOU KNOW

02:30:06.263 --> 02:30:10.101
INSPECTIONS OCCURRING ON. IT IN

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:16.173
TERMS OF- SYSTEMIC FAILURE WHAT

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:18.976
I WOULD SAY IS WHILE THERE IS A

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:22.847
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE E. COLI

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:25.216
OUTBREAK IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

02:30:25.282 --> 02:30:27.184
THE COVERT OPERATE WITHIN. THE

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:29.887
CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AGAIN THE

02:30:29.954 --> 02:30:32.490
REASON WE'RE HAVING THE HEARING

02:30:32.556 --> 02:30:35.326
IS AS WELL THE HEARING THAT WE

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:35.793
HAD ON SKILLED NURSING

02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:39.563
FACILITIES IS. FAR AWAY

02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:41.465
INSTITUTIONALLY THESE TWO TYPES

02:30:41.532 --> 02:30:44.101
OF INSTITUTIONS LONG CREATED

02:30:44.168 --> 02:30:46.904
DISPROPORTION NET NOT NUMBER OF

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:50.474
KOBE CASES IN SO. I DON'T I

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:53.644
MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT

02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:56.046
GOING AGAINST ALL THE VARIOUS

02:30:56.113 --> 02:30:57.381
PRISON FACILITIES BECAUSE OF

02:30:57.448 --> 02:30:59.450
HOW PEOPLE ARE HOUSED IN THE

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:01.285
CROWDING EXCITER CENTER ACCENT

02:31:01.352 --> 02:31:03.788
REAL SPENT DODD THAT'S WHY WE

02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:07.158
ARE. SO CONCERNED- I THINK

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:08.125
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE

02:31:08.192 --> 02:31:09.794
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL WHICH IS

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:11.195
THE PHYSICAL PLANT WE CANNOT

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:13.731
CHANGE THAT VERY EASILY. BUT

02:31:13.798 --> 02:31:14.732
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WITH

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:17.201
IN ON YOUR CONTROL AND THAT'S

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:19.170
WHY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:31:19.236 --> 02:31:19.904
THINGS THAT WORKING YOUR

02:31:19.970 --> 02:31:22.606
CONTROL. THAT COULD HAVE

02:31:22.673 --> 02:31:24.041
REDUCED WOULDN'T HAVE MITIGATED

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:25.309
EVERYTHING BUT COULD HAVE

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:28.679
REDUCED THE SITUATION. ON WAS

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:31.682
NOT WAS NOT DONE AND WAS NOT

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:35.186
DONE IN A SYSTEMIC FASHION. SO

02:31:35.252 --> 02:31:37.054
THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:40.758
ENOUGH DATA. TO SHOW PRETTY

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:43.194
SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCY

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:45.796
THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION-

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:48.966
DOES POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS-

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:50.935
SOME SOME SOME SOME LEVEL OF

02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:53.003
SYSTEMATIC FAILURE AND IN MY

02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:54.805
OPINION. ON WHETHER WE HAVE A

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:57.708
DIFFERENT OPINION ON THAT. ON

02:31:57.775 --> 02:31:58.976
IT. JUSTIN I ASKED THE SAME

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.344
QUESTION FOR THE IG BUT IS IT

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:01.979
IS A REALLY UNDER YOUR PURVIEW

02:32:02.046 --> 02:32:03.681
WERE SUS UNDER THE- THE

02:32:03.747 --> 02:32:05.483

MULTIPLE MEMORY. YES IT IS A

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:19.563
JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN- C. C. R.

02:32:21.465 --> 02:32:23.801
VARIETY OF MEMOS. THAT HAVE

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:24.401
BEEN SIGNED EITHER BY AT THE

02:32:24.468 --> 02:32:27.137
DIRECTORATE LEVEL. OR ADD OF

02:32:27.204 --> 02:32:28.906
THE SECRETARY AND RECEIVER

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:32.142
LEVEL. SO IS DOCTOR BIXEL THEIR-

02:32:32.209 --> 02:32:34.345
YES OF COURSE BUT TO HAVE THE-

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:36.313
FOR THE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY.

FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO JUST SET

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:55.165
UP A SIMILAR QUESTIONS RIGHT I

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:57.968
MEAN YOU'RE- THE YOUR YOUR

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:00.404
DOCTOR I IMAGINE LOOK DO YOU

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:02.840
LIKE- ALL THE VARIOUS PUBLIC

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:04.775
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE

02:33:04.842 --> 02:33:08.445
STATE. DISCOVERED EARLY ON THAT

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:10.748
WEARING A MASK WAS WELL ONE OF

02:33:10.814 --> 02:33:11.982
THE BEST WAYS TO PREVENT THE

02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:13.551
SPREAD OF COVERT IS THAT A FAIR

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:16.820
STATEMENT. I THINK PRETTY EARLY

02:33:16.887 --> 02:33:18.222
ON WE KNEW THAT IT WAS AN

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:19.823
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:24.295
RESPONSE YES- DO. IN THE END

02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:26.664
WHY WHY IN YOUR OPINION WAS IT

02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:29.433
NOT UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTED

02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:34.905
THROUGHOUT THE- SYSTEM. SO

02:33:34.972 --> 02:33:36.240
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT WAS

02:33:36.307 --> 02:33:38.175
AN ISSUE SO MUCH OF NOT BEING

02:33:38.242 --> 02:33:41.445
UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTED IT'S JUST

02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:42.713
THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.082
THE DEPARTMENT OF SIXTY FIVE

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:47.551
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND ONE

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:49.119
HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE

02:33:49.186 --> 02:33:51.655
GETTING ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ON

02:33:51.722 --> 02:33:54.458
THE SAME PAGE AND COMPLYING CAN

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:57.595
BE CHALLENGING. WHAT WHAT DO

02:33:57.661 --> 02:33:58.862
YOU THINK THAT START WITH A

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:02.132
PIECE PEOPLE. YOU HAVE PEOPLE

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:04.268
DYING IN FACILITIES A PRETTY

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:08.672
PRETTY HIGH NUMBERS. WHY DO YOU

02:34:08.739 --> 02:34:11.141
THINK THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:12.876
THAT AS A CUE TO. TAKE THIS

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:17.481
SERIOUSLY. WELL I THINK WHAT WE

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:18.949
SEE IN OUR SYSTEM REALLY

02:34:19.016 --> 02:34:20.117
MIRRORS WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:21.952
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY FOR A

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:24.622
VARIETY OF. REASONS WHERE THERE

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:26.090
ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SELLING

02:34:26.156 --> 02:34:28.292
DOUBT AND CONFUSION ABOUT

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:30.227
WHETHER OR NOT MASKS ARE

02:34:30.294 --> 02:34:31.428
HELPFUL OR WHETHER THEY'RE

02:34:31.495 --> 02:34:34.298
HARMFUL- THAT'S BEEN IT AS

02:34:34.365 --> 02:34:36.900
YOU'VE NOWN A TOPIC OF

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:39.837
CONVERSATION- IN OUR IN OUR

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.739
POLITICAL SYSTEM FOR SOME TIME

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.440
AND- SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE

02:34:43.507 --> 02:34:45.242
SEEING INSIDE OUR INSTITUTIONS

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:46.477
IS IN MANY WAYS JUST A

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:49.580
REFLECTION. OF THAT SAME

02:34:49.647 --> 02:34:51.815
ARGUMENT- THE DEPARTMENT REALLY

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:54.318
ACTED QUITE PROMPTLY EARLY ON

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:56.920
IN IN CONVERTING PIAA FACTORIES

02:34:56.987 --> 02:34:59.289
TO CREATING FACE COVERINGS AND

02:34:59.356 --> 02:35:01.058
PROVIDING THEM TO ALL OF OUR

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:02.292
PATIENTS AND TO ALL OF OUR

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:05.062
STAFF. AND ESTABLISHING THE

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:07.097
EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WOULD BE

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:08.565
USED TO SO I THINK THE

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:11.635
DEPARTMENT ACTED PROMPTLY- BUT

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:13.270
AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:15.339
OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:35:15.406 --> 02:35:17.007
THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ALL ARE.

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:19.810
FREE THINKERS SOMETIMES- IT

02:35:19.877 --> 02:35:20.577
DOES NOT GO THE WAY THAT YOU

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:24.048
WOULD HOPE I TOTALLY TOTALLY

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.649
AGREE AND I COULDN'T DOWN. I'M

02:35:25.716 --> 02:35:28.052
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE THAT BUT-

02:35:28.118 --> 02:35:30.921
WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM IN ARE.

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:35.526
YOU YOU ARE A DEPARTMENT. YOUR

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:36.193
YOU DON'T RUN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL.

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:37.695
YOU DEPARTMENT WERE FREEDOM HAS

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:42.099
BEEN. TAKEN WORK. SO WHAT WAS

02:35:42.166 --> 02:35:45.202
SO DIFFICULT ABOUT IMPLEMENTING

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:47.337
THE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY

02:35:47.404 --> 02:35:48.806
COLLEAGUES DIRECTIVE IT WASN'T

02:35:48.872 --> 02:35:50.674
IT WASN'T I'M A LITTLE BIT

02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:52.376
SURPRISED SECRETARY ALISON

02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:54.078
CHARACTERIZES IT AS IT WASN'T

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:56.113
CLEAR I THINK IT WAS PRETTY

02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:59.349
CRYSTAL CLEAR. HIGH EVER SINCE

02:35:59.416 --> 02:36:01.719
I'VE RETURNED BACK TO WORK AND

02:36:01.785 --> 02:36:03.554
WE'VE MY FIRST RETURN BACK TO

02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:05.689
WORK IN THIS ROOM I GOT MY

02:36:05.756 --> 02:36:07.491
COLLEAGUES HERE WE ALL. SHOWED

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:11.228
UP WITH THE MASS WHEN WE RETURN.

02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:18.135
SO WHAT. WHY WERE STATE

02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:19.803
EMPLOYEES ALL STATE EMPLOYEES

02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:21.705
LET'S JUST YOU KNOW STATE

02:36:21.772 --> 02:36:26.276
EMPLOYEES. WHY WERE STATE

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:31.281
EMPLOYEES ALLOWED. TO DISREGARD

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:32.516
BUT THE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:36.019
KHALID. REALLY KIND OF ORDERED

02:36:36.086 --> 02:36:40.557
EVERYBODY TO DO. WELL FIRST I'D

02:36:40.624 --> 02:36:41.959
LIKE TO SAY THAT I DON'T WANT

02:36:42.025 --> 02:36:43.627
TO HAVE ANYTHING I'M SAYING BE

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:46.196
INTERPRETED AS SUGGESTING THAT

02:36:46.263 --> 02:36:47.564
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FACE

02:36:47.631 --> 02:36:49.900
COVERINGS ARE AN EXTREMELY

02:36:49.967 --> 02:36:51.802
IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO.

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:54.505
IT'S BEEN PART OF OUR PLAN FROM

02:36:54.571 --> 02:36:56.507
VERY EARLY TIMES IN FACT WHEN

02:36:56.573 --> 02:36:57.508
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:59.910
OUTBREAKS IN INSTITUTIONS WE'VE

02:36:59.977 --> 02:37:01.545
GONE BEYOND STANDARD FACE

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:02.546
COVERINGS AND IN SOME

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:04.648
SITUATIONS ABOUT BREAKS HAVE

02:37:04.715 --> 02:37:07.618
PROVIDED N. NINETY FIVE MASKS

02:37:07.684 --> 02:37:10.053
TO BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND TO

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.722
THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE AN

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:13.423
OUTBREAK FACILITIES AND UNABLE

02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:17.227
TO- WE FEEL PROTECT THEMSELVES

02:37:17.294 --> 02:37:18.695
WITH JUST STANDARD FEE. THAT

02:37:18.762 --> 02:37:22.800
BEING SAID- MY EXPERIENCE HAS

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:24.535
BEEN THAT WEARING A FACE

02:37:24.601 --> 02:37:25.936
COVERING IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:37:26.003 --> 02:37:29.106
CHANGE IN IN YOUR DAY TO DAY

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:30.707

MAKE YOU ARE HOT SOME PEOPLE

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:39.349
SAY THEY'RE HARD TO BREED WITH

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:41.351
AND JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT

02:37:41.418 --> 02:37:43.420
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU

02:37:43.487 --> 02:37:44.988
AND I TO WEAR THE FACE COVERING

02:37:45.055 --> 02:37:47.124
THROUGH OUR DAY AND THEN TRY TO

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:47.858
EXTRAPOLATE THAT FOR OUR

02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:50.227
PATIENTS- WHO BASICALLY ARE

02:37:50.294 --> 02:37:51.161
BEING ASKED TO WEAR FACE

02:37:51.228 --> 02:37:55.632
COVERING. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

02:37:55.699 --> 02:37:56.133
THREE SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE

02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:56.867
THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE

02:37:56.934 --> 02:37:59.069
THEY REALLY CANNOT GET AWAY BY

02:37:59.136 --> 02:38:03.307
THEMSELVES IN A CLOSED ROOM

02:38:03.373 --> 02:38:05.309
WITH NO ONE ELSE IN THEIR AREA

02:38:05.375 --> 02:38:07.744
IT'S REALLY A HEAVY LIFT AND SO

02:38:07.811 --> 02:38:09.680
MY EXPERIENCE IS BAD I MEAN I

02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:11.849
SPENT TIME IN IN DISABILITIES

02:38:11.915 --> 02:38:13.784
ON A REGULAR BASIS. AT THE

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:15.319
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:17.454
PATIENTS AND OUR STAFF ARE

02:38:17.521 --> 02:38:19.089
DOING A PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF

02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:21.825
WEARING THEIR FACE COVERINGS UP

02:38:21.892 --> 02:38:23.827
THERE NOT BEING PERFECT THEY'RE

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:26.230
FALLIBLE AS MANY OF YOU HAVE

02:38:26.296 --> 02:38:28.899
POINTED OUT OUR PHYSICAL PLANT

02:38:28.966 --> 02:38:31.335
IS NOT VERY CONDUCIVE- TO

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:33.070
PEOPLE BEING PERFECT BUT THEIR

02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:36.006
FACE MASKS STAFF DON'T HAVE

02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:36.640
BREAK ROOMS WHERE THEY CAN GO

02:38:36.707 --> 02:38:39.843
EAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT'S

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:41.178
NOT EASY FOR THEM TO JUST STEP

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:44.181
OUTSIDE AND GET A QUICK BREATH

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:45.015
OF FRESH AIR SO THEY CAN TAKE

02:38:45.082 --> 02:38:47.651
THEIR MASK OFF FOR FIVE MINUTES

02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:48.886
DURING THEIR SHIFT MANY OF THEM

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:50.821
WORKED DOUBLE SHIFTS THERE IS

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:53.991
ONLY FOR A LOT OF TIME SO I

02:38:54.057 --> 02:38:56.026
COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

02:38:56.093 --> 02:39:01.164
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I.

02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:01.732
JUST THINK WE NEED TO THINK

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:02.366

THINK THAT'S VOCAL AND I THINK

02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:10.407
WE- I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:13.210
AND- THIS IS BEEN A PANDEMIC

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:14.745
THAT'S AFFECTED EVERY SINGLE

02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:15.679
PERSON THE STATE THERE'S NO

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:17.614
QUESTION AND IN YOUR RIGHT IT

02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:20.250
IS A IT IS A BURDEN. ON THE

02:39:20.317 --> 02:39:23.587
FOLKS THAT WE ARE ASKING. TO DO

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:25.789
THAT. BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU

SYSTEMICALLY WE ARE. ENFORCING

02:39:34.698 --> 02:39:37.367
THE ARMS WE ARE ENFORCING THE

02:39:37.434 --> 02:39:40.304
MASK PROTOCOLS. BUT IT'S REALLY

02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:42.172
JUST EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU

02:39:42.239 --> 02:39:43.507
KNOW LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S

02:39:43.573 --> 02:39:45.943
FALLIBILITY AND ABSOLUTELY.

02:39:46.009 --> 02:39:48.378
EVERY NOW AND THEN- PEOPLE

02:39:48.445 --> 02:39:50.914
AREN'T FOLLOWING- FROM THE

02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:53.050
RULES THAT THAT'S SORT OF. WHAT

02:39:53.116 --> 02:39:54.651

02:39:57.187 --> 02:39:58.255
WEARING THESE MASTERS NO

02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:59.656
QUESTION DOES NOT DEMAND

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:01.091
ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE THE FIRST

02:40:01.158 --> 02:40:04.895
PERSON TO ADMIT THAT. ON BUT

02:40:04.962 --> 02:40:08.298
THAT'S SORT OF WHAT. I HEARD

02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:09.466
YOU SAY THAT FOR.

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:12.436
CHARACTERIZATION WELL WHAT I

02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:14.137
WOULD SAY IS WE'VE GOT FOLKS

02:40:14.204 --> 02:40:16.139
WERE ARE WORKING REALLY REALLY

02:40:16.206 --> 02:40:18.875
HARD IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:21.845
WHERE THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO-

02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:23.680
THE POSSIBILITY OF CORBETT-

02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:26.450
EVERY DAY AT WORK- THEIR FIRST

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:28.285
RESPONDERS ARE PEACE OFFICERS

02:40:28.352 --> 02:40:30.187
ARE NURSES ARE PHYSICIANS I

02:40:30.253 --> 02:40:32.322
THINK THEY'RE ALL DOING A

02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:34.424
PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF TRYING

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.727
TO COMPLY. I THINK PERHAPS THE

02:40:36.793 --> 02:40:38.962
PART THAT HAS BEEN LACKING INTO

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:41.898
RECENTLY IS THE DISCIPLINARY

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:44.234
COMPONENT OF WHAT WE WILL DO

02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:46.536
WITH FOLKS WHO WE JUST ARE NOT

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:47.871
WILLING TO COMPLY I'M NOT

02:40:47.938 --> 02:40:49.139
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TAKE%

02:40:49.206 --> 02:40:51.541
THEIR MASK DOWN TO EAT THEIR

REASON DECIDE IT'S JUST NOT

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:57.881
IMPORTANT. THAT COMPONENT IS

02:40:57.948 --> 02:41:02.519
NOW BEING STRENGTHENED AND. AND

02:41:02.586 --> 02:41:03.854
I THINK THAT BY DOING THAT IT

02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:05.088
HERE IT'S IS GOING TO EAT

02:41:05.155 --> 02:41:07.324

A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT YOU HAVE

02:42:30.173 --> 02:42:32.442

A ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE

02:43:20.524 --> 02:43:23.693
CHOICES HOTEL THIS WAS SOMEHOW.

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:26.363
PEOPLE GIVEN A CHOICE.

WE USED TO FILL VACANCIES.

03:03:00.336 --> 03:03:02.604
HOWEVER AT ANY GIVEN TIME- AND

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:03.906
IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE PRIMARY

03:03:03.972 --> 03:03:05.941
EVEN COVERT RELATED IT COULD

03:03:06.008 --> 03:03:08.477
JUST BE OTHER REASONS WE HAD

03:03:08.544 --> 03:03:10.579

PERIOD OF TIME. I UNDERSTAND

03:03:38.674 --> 03:03:40.609
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE METRIC IS

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:42.945
THERE TO TRY AND MEASURE THE

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:45.147

AS WELL BE IN A PRISON THAT'S

03:11:19.835 --> 03:11:20.502

AND WHAT YOU'RE NOT DOING

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:19.427
RATHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

03:12:19.494 --> 03:12:22.797
INTO BECAUSE- WHAT I FIND IS

03:12:22.864 --> 03:12:23.365
WHEN THE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME

IT ALREADY HAD I MEAN. THIS

03:12:54.829 --> 03:12:56.865
THIS IS. A MAJOR CHALLENGE AYE

03:12:56.932 --> 03:12:57.933
AYE YOU KNOW YOU HEARD THE

03:12:57.999 --> 03:12:59.267
SECRETARY TALKED ABOUT HOW

03:12:59.334 --> 03:13:00.802
DIFFICULT THIS IS FOR THE

03:13:00.869 --> 03:13:03.204
INMATES IN THE HOLIDAYS. YOU

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:06.408
EXPRESSED- THE CHALLENGES WE

03:13:06.474 --> 03:13:08.777
KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

03:13:08.843 --> 03:13:10.478
INMATES DON'T WANT TO BE MOVED

03:13:10.545 --> 03:13:12.414
IS BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAMMING.

03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:15.984
SOUL YOU KNOW WHAT BUT THE

03:13:16.051 --> 03:13:17.218
RECEIVER SAID AS WELL PROGRAM

03:13:17.285 --> 03:13:20.021
IS CHIEF FOR THE EQUITY BILITY

03:13:20.088 --> 03:13:22.057
WITHIN THE FACILITY AND BETWEEN

03:13:22.123 --> 03:13:24.793
THE DIFFERENT YARDS. SO WHAT

03:13:24.859 --> 03:13:26.695
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO KIND OF

03:13:26.761 --> 03:13:36.304
BRIDGE THAT GAP. SO. SO I DON'T

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:38.039
FACE WITH THE EXPANDING

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:39.240
PROGRAMMING I KNOW THAT'S NOT

03:13:39.307 --> 03:13:42.644
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR- WHAT WAS

03:13:42.711 --> 03:13:44.012
ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT I HEAR

03:13:44.079 --> 03:13:47.015
YOU SAY THAT AND IT TELLSME WE

03:13:47.082 --> 03:13:50.285
HAVEN'T GOT AROUND TO IT THAT'S

03:13:50.352 --> 03:13:51.019
WHAT THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE. AND

03:13:51.086 --> 03:13:52.320
THAT'S WHAT THE INMATES ARE

03:13:52.387 --> 03:13:53.288
PROBABLY FEELING. BUT WE

03:13:53.355 --> 03:13:56.458
HAVEN'T. GOTTEN TO THAT YET.

03:13:56.524 --> 03:13:58.193
THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOUR

03:13:58.259 --> 03:14:02.998
WORDS TRANSLATE TO ME. SO WE

03:14:03.064 --> 03:14:04.833
ARE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING

03:14:04.899 --> 03:14:06.868
CREATIVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS-

03:14:06.935 --> 03:14:07.836
AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

03:14:07.902 --> 03:14:09.270
SPENDING EXPANDING BECAUSE WE

03:14:09.337 --> 03:14:12.107
CAN'T- IN INSTITUTIONS WERE

03:14:12.173 --> 03:14:13.408
REAR A PHASE ONE WE CAN'T

03:14:13.475 --> 03:14:14.876
CONTINUE TO BRING INMATES

03:14:14.943 --> 03:14:16.478
TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE

03:14:16.544 --> 03:14:18.346
FOR THEM. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:20.115
OTHER SOLUTIONS WHERE WE CAN

03:14:20.181 --> 03:14:21.716
INCREASE PARTICIPATION WHERE WE

03:14:21.783 --> 03:14:24.252
PROVIDE MORE IN CELL TYPE-

03:14:24.319 --> 03:14:26.521
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND

03:14:26.588 --> 03:14:28.490
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

03:14:28.556 --> 03:14:30.959
WAYS TO POSSIBLY MAKE THESE

03:14:31.026 --> 03:14:32.427
REHABILITATED WHICH READING

03:14:32.494 --> 03:14:35.630
READING TYPE PROGRAMS. BUT

03:14:35.697 --> 03:14:36.765
pTHOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE

03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:38.900
CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON WHERE

03:14:38.967 --> 03:14:39.901
AND WHEN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE

03:14:39.968 --> 03:14:42.470
BEING ABLE TO. START TO

03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:43.638
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE.

03:14:43.705 --> 03:14:50.078
PERHAPS. HOPE TO. SOON AS THE

03:14:50.145 --> 03:14:52.147
TIME FRAME FOR ME I MEAN SINCE

03:14:52.213 --> 03:14:54.783
MY STAFF KNOWS WITH THROUGH

03:14:54.849 --> 03:14:56.951
MEANS TO ME WAS YESTERDAY. I

03:14:57.018 --> 03:14:58.286
DON'T KNOW WITH WHOM IS TO USE

03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:00.088
SO MAYBE WE COULD WE COULD USE

03:15:00.155 --> 03:15:03.425
A DATE RIGHT BY. DECEMBER BY.

03:15:03.491 --> 03:15:07.729
JANUARY FEBRUARY WHAT AS SOON.

03:15:07.796 --> 03:15:10.698
WE CAN GET J. O. A TIMELINE OF

03:15:10.765 --> 03:15:13.468
WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT- BUT

03:15:13.535 --> 03:15:14.869
I WOULD NEED TO WORK WITH MY

03:15:14.936 --> 03:15:16.871
DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATIVE

03:15:16.938 --> 03:15:19.040
GROUNDS- PERSONNEL AND WE CAN

03:15:19.107 --> 03:15:20.341
GET YOU A TIMELINE THAT WOULD

03:23:28.963 --> 03:23:29.797
OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT

03:23:29.864 --> 03:23:31.432
HERE NOW IT WHERE THEY WOULD

JUST START LIKE A PILOT PROGRAM

03:23:38.406 --> 03:23:39.640
