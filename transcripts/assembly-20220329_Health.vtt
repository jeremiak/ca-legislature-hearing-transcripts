01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.801
WITH THAT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.703

TO THEIR INCARCERATION ARM

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.790
SO HAVING SEEN THAT AND

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.302
GET PICKED UP AGAIN AND GO

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.671
BACK INTO WHATEVER SITUATION

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:04.540
THEY WERE IN JAIL PRISON --

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.076
OR I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:10.146
HAPPENED TO THEM --

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.248
BUT I KNOW THEY'RE CAUGHT ONE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.916
IN THE IN PARTICULAR HAD BEEN

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:16.018
STABBED IN I MEAN IT'S NEVER

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.221
A GOOD LIFE IT'S A CYCLE AND

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.722
YOU SEE IT NO MATTER HOW HARD

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:22.258
I TRIED AS A BUSINESS OWNER --

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.693
AND I HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS WHAT

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.461
COULD BE DONE FROM THAT ASPECT

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.597
BUT IT'S THERE'S SO MANY LAWS

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.998
AND PRIVACY AND ALL THESE THINGS

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.299
THAT GET IN THE WAY OF BEING

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.767
ABLE TO TRY TO HELP SOMEBODY

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.338
SO -- THAT BEING SAID

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:37.173
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN LEGISLATOR

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.441
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE SITTING

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.842
IN MY APARTMENT AND THERE

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.278
WAS A DOCUMENTARY ON ABOUT

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.647
THE LA COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.449
AND ALSO THE WOMEN'S PRISON

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:50.119
AND HOW AND WE KNOW THE JAILS

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:51.587
ARE AT THE LA COUNTY JAILS

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:52.822
ONE OF THE LARGEST MENTAL

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.824
HEALTH PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.158
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.628
AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE --

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.963
I SAW THESE WOMEN SITTING

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.565
AND THEY INTERVIEWED THEM AND

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:03.899
ASKED THEM HOW MANY TIMES HAVE

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.801
YOU BEEN INCARCERATED TWELVE

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:08.638
TIMES FIFTEEN TIMES TWENTY

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.406
TIMES AND IT'S LIKE THEY HAVE

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.408
CHILDREN EVERYONE OF THEM WHAT'S

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:14.243
HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS SO I'M

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.211
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU'RE

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.445
TALKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.247
EFFECTS OF FAMILY SEPARATION

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.316
THAT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT JUST

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.084
INCREASES THAT CYCLE AGAIN

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:24.453
INTO THE NEXT GENERATION SO

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:28.424
-- A COUPLE OF THINGS I IT

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.093
I THINK THE GOAL IS

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.896
THAT WE KNOW THAT WE EXACERBATE

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.400
THOMAS IN THING CARCERAL SETTING

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.802
SO HOW THE GOAL SEEMS TO BE HOW

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.470
CAN WE HEAL TRAUMAS AND BRING

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.339
PEOPLE TO ACTUAL RESTORATION

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:44.807
I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.243
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.679

I SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.487
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.756
IF YOU DO AN AMENDMENT IF THERE

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.391

EFFECTIVE MEANS OF TREATMENT

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:11.211

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:45.305
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE PERSON

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.739

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:48.948
I'M STAKEHOLDERS WITH A LOT

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:50.749
OF STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON BE

02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:53.252
DIRECTED TOWARDS -- VICTIMS OF

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:55.821
THE WAR ON DRUGS AND

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:57.289
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.391
COMMUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:01.227
THE FUND SHOULD BE USED FOR

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:02.962
PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW THAT WORK

02:05:03.028 --> 02:05:04.763
LIKE HARM REDUCTION RECOVERY

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.732
RESIDENTS HOUSING I'M OUT REACH

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.767
AND ENGAGEMENT -- AND TREATMENT

02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:10.369
MODELS THAT WE KNOW THAT WORKS

02:05:10.736 --> 02:05:13.038
I'M ON YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ON

02:05:13.372 --> 02:05:15.407
WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:17.710
-- A HARMFUL TO CREATE A PILOT

02:05:17.776 --> 02:05:20.746
PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN THAT PROGRAMS

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.681
LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE AND

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:24.250
IN OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'VE

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:26.886
USED -- COERCED OR MANDATED

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:28.921
-- OR INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:30.422
AND WE SEEN THAT THOSE MODELS

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:32.458
HAVE NOT ENDED UP WORKING IT

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:34.159
CAN FOSTER DISTRUST BETWEEN IT

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.661
BETWEEN THE TREATMENT PROVIDER

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.329
AND THE INDIVIDUAL THERE CAN

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:39.064
BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE'S

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.133
INCREASED RISK OF OVERDOSE

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.601
FOR THE PERSON COMING OUT OF

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:44.470
THE PROGRAM AND WE SEE THAT

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:47.239
THESE -- TYPES OF SITUATIONS

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:48.974
BURNED BRIDGES AND AS WE'VE

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:51.210
SAID BEFORE -- BUT WE BELIEVE

02:05:51.277 --> 02:05:53.579
THAT THE YOU CAN FOCUS ON --

02:05:53.646 --> 02:05:55.247
INTENSIVE VOLUNTARY TREATMENT

02:05:55.314 --> 02:05:56.749
AND SEE JUST THE SAME KIND

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.751
OF RESULTS OR IF NOT WORK

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.619
SITE BETTER RESULTS THAN YOU

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:02.221
COULD SEE UNDER THIS TYPE OF A

02:06:02.288 --> 02:06:04.356
PROGRAM AS WELL AS WE SEE THAT

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:07.192
INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE TO BE --

02:06:07.426 --> 02:06:09.361
IS THERE'S OTHER CHOICES BETWEEN

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:10.963
THESE TWO CHOICES THANK YOU

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.332
THANK YOU UP WOULD YOU CARE TO

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.401
COMMENT MISTER MCCARTY YEAH THIS

02:06:15.467 --> 02:06:17.703
IS JUST A LOT TO MENTALLY UNPACK

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:20.172
THERE THAT LONG LIST -- BUT

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.308
DID NOT SELL AS IS IF THIS BILL

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.944
SAID WHAT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:26.111
ROUTE LEADING I WOULDN'T BE

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.079
UP HERE AUTHORED THIS BILL

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:29.615
IS JUST NOT TRUE --

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:31.350
THERE'S A THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.252
LONGER SENTENCE FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:34.720
WE CLEARLY SAYING THE BILL

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:36.622
THAT THEY WOULD SERVE LAST TIME

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:37.823
INTO THE STREET AND THEY WOULD

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.692
BE SENTENCED OTHERWISE AND

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:40.993
IT'S A FALSE CHOICE THAT THEY

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.262
COULD YOU KNOW HAVE COMMUNITY

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.830
WRAPAROUND TREATMENT AT HOME

02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:47.866
THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TWO CHOICES

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:49.535
THEY CAN GO TO JAIL OR PRISON

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:51.003
TO BE SENTENCE FOR A TERM FOR

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:53.005
THAT SO THERE'S NOT GOING HOME

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:54.907
WITH AN ANKLE BRACELET GETTING

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:56.241
THE TREATMENT WHEN YOU WISH TO

02:06:56.308 --> 02:06:57.609
AROUND THE CORNER THAT'S NOT

02:06:57.676 --> 02:06:58.777
A CHOICE YOU'RE SOMEBODY IS

MORE THAN ANYWAY THE ISSUE HERE

02:07:02.781 --> 02:07:04.049
IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE SENTENCED

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:06.285

TO MAINTAIN THEIR COVERAGE

02:35:06.930 --> 02:35:08.265
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:09.633
IN RECOGNITION THAT THERE

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:11.702

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:12.029
IMPACT ON THEM IS THAT WE START

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:40.610
YOU VERY MUCH THEIR GERIATRIC

02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:43.646
CIRCLES STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB

02:48:43.847 --> 02:48:46.249
TWENTY SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:48.418
OF THIS BILL WOULD HAVE THE

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:50.687
EFFECT OF SHIFTING AN ADDITIONAL

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:53.323
TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF REVENUES

02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:55.792
INTO DIRECT CARE UP FOR

02:48:55.859 --> 02:48:57.560
CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS

02:48:57.627 --> 02:48:59.596
IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK IT

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.764
WOULD HAVE FOUR MAJOR BENEFITS

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:04.501
FIRST IT WOULD INCLUDE ENCOURAGE

02:49:04.567 --> 02:49:07.270
HIGHER STAFFING LEVELS AND WAGES

02:49:07.737 --> 02:49:09.305
AND WE KNOW THAT MANY NURSING

02:49:09.372 --> 02:49:11.341
HOMES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD A

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:13.543
HISTORY OF INADEQUATE STAFFING

02:49:13.810 --> 02:49:15.912
AND THIS IS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:18.581
HIGHER COVED NINETEEN RESIDENT

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:20.049
INSPECTION RIGHTS AND DEATH

02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:22.118
RATES AND MANY OTHER SERIOUS

02:49:22.185 --> 02:49:24.787
QUALITY PROBLEMS AT NURSING

02:49:24.854 --> 02:49:27.257
HOME STAFF WAGES CONTINUE

02:49:27.323 --> 02:49:29.559
TO BE LOW AND TURNOVER RATES

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:31.461
ARE AS HIGH AS FIFTY PERCENT

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:34.297
THE SECOND BENEFIT IS THAT IT

02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:36.633
WOULD CONTROL EXCESS PROFITS

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:40.103
EVEN THOUGH PATIENT DAYS AN

02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:42.472
OCCUPANCY RATES IN CALIFORNIA

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:45.041
NURSING HOMES DROPPED IN TWENTY

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:47.810
TWENTY THE PROFITS OF NURSING

02:49:47.877 --> 02:49:50.413
HOMES WERE SIX PERCENT AND SOME

02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:52.582
NURSING HOMES EVEN HAD FIFTEEN

02:49:52.649 --> 02:49:54.751
TO THIRTY PERCENT PROFITS

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:57.186
WE ALSO KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA

02:49:57.253 --> 02:49:59.322
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

02:49:59.622 --> 02:50:01.591
ARE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE DAILY

02:50:01.658 --> 02:50:04.327
RATES ARE NINETY ONE PERCENT

02:50:04.394 --> 02:50:06.229
OF MEDICARE RATES IN TWENTY

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:08.364
TWENTY AND OF COURSE THE DAILY

02:50:08.431 --> 02:50:10.767
RATES SHOULD BE UP FOR MEDICARE

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:12.302
SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER

02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:14.170
BECAUSE THOSE ARE FOR POST

02:50:14.237 --> 02:50:16.072
ACUTE RESIDENTS THAT REQUIRE

02:50:16.139 --> 02:50:18.508
MORE REHAB AND NURSING CARE

02:50:19.709 --> 02:50:21.811
THE THIRD BENEFIT IS THAT IT

02:50:21.878 --> 02:50:24.414
WOULD DISCOURAGE AND REDUCE

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.482
HIDDEN PROFITS AND HIDDEN

02:50:26.549 --> 02:50:29.452
MANAGEMENT CAUGHT COST WHERE

02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:32.488
-- AS -- DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:34.857
AT NURSING HOMES SIPHON

02:50:34.924 --> 02:50:36.659
THIS MONEY OFF INTO THE ROOM

02:50:36.726 --> 02:50:39.329
RELATED PARTY COMPANIES AND

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:41.864
FINALLY OF WE THINK IT WOULD

02:50:41.931 --> 02:50:44.133
ENCOURAGE REDUCTIONS IN EXCESS

02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.502
PROPERTY COST WE KNOW THAT SOME

02:50:46.569 --> 02:50:49.639
PROPERTY OF OWNERS CHARGE

02:50:49.706 --> 02:50:52.408
EXCESSIVE RATES STUDENTS TO THE

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:55.144
NURSING HOME COMPANIES AND SOME

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:57.213
HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE

02:50:57.547 --> 02:50:59.983
THREE TO FIVE PERCENT INCREASES

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:02.151
BUILT RIGHT INTO THE LEASE EACH

02:51:02.218 --> 02:51:04.687
YEAR AND THIS PULLS UP

02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:07.991
REVENUES AWAY FROM RESIDENT CARE

02:51:08.424 --> 02:51:11.494
IN SUMMARY OF THIS LEGISLATION

02:51:11.561 --> 02:51:13.396
IS SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:15.832
PASSED IN NEW JERSEY NEW

02:51:15.898 --> 02:51:18.468
YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS LAST

02:51:18.534 --> 02:51:20.536
YEAR AND THE BILL WOULD

02:51:20.603 --> 02:51:22.405
HAVE IT ENSURE GREATER

02:51:22.472 --> 02:51:24.907
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:51:24.974 --> 02:51:26.876
IMPROVED NURSING HOME QUALITY

02:51:28.444 --> 02:51:30.780
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:31.948
I'M TONY CHECK ITSELF WITH

THE TIMING IS INTERESTING HERE

02:51:39.288 --> 02:51:40.223
JUST YESTERDAY THERE WAS AN

02:51:40.289 --> 02:51:42.125
ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE

02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:47.130
OF THE FINANCING SYSTEM RE

02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:48.765
AUTHORIZATION WAS DISCUSSED

02:51:49.198 --> 02:51:51.401
-- TO SOME DEGREE OF LENGTH

02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:54.337
N. HERE IT IT'S VIRTUALLY

02:51:54.404 --> 02:51:55.204
GUARANTEED THAT THE

02:51:55.271 --> 02:51:56.072
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

02:51:56.139 --> 02:51:58.441
PROPOSE GIVING THE INDUSTRY MORE

GET RAISES AND EVERY YEAR THE

02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:03.813
QUALITY STAYS ABOUT THE SAME AND

02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:05.648
IT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN VERY GOOD

02:52:06.716 --> 02:52:08.885
WHEN THE CURRENT FINANCING

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:09.819
SYSTEM WAS SET UP IN TWO

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:10.887
THOUSAND FOUR THERE WERE BIG

02:52:10.953 --> 02:52:12.855
PROMISES MADE THAT HEY WE GET

BETTER CARE THINGS WILL IMPROVE

02:52:15.491 --> 02:52:17.493
AND THAT JUST HAS NOT HAPPENED

02:52:17.927 --> 02:52:19.328
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

02:52:19.395 --> 02:52:20.997
BILL WHICH WOULD WOULD BE A

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.799
MAJOR REFORM TO ESTABLISH A

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:25.234
DIRECT CARE -- MINIMUM

02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:28.104
EXPENDITURE AS AS DR HARRINGTON

02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:29.272
MENTIONED OTHER STATES HAVE

02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:31.307
DONE THIS THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN

02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:33.009
DEVASTATING TO THE STAFF AND

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:34.911
THE RESIDENTS IN FACILITIES AND

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:36.579
IT'S TIME THAT WE REALLY ROLL

02:52:36.646 --> 02:52:37.547
UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET REAL

02:52:37.613 --> 02:52:38.881
REFORM AND WE STARTED LAST YEAR

02:52:38.948 --> 02:52:40.650
WE HAD A NUMBER WE HAD FOR BILLS

02:52:40.717 --> 02:52:42.785
THAT WERE VERY REFORM ORIENTED

02:52:42.852 --> 02:52:43.820
PASSED LAST YEAR PART OF THE

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.955
PROTECT PLAN I THINK WE HAVE

02:52:46.022 --> 02:52:47.023
SOME MORE WORK TO DO I THINK

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:48.291
THIS THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:50.259

REGARD AND I THINK FOR US --

02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:28.991
THIS BILL AT LEAST AS IT'S

02:54:29.058 --> 02:54:31.093
CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE DON'T

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:32.728

02:54:32.795 --> 02:54:35.331
FORM REALLY ADDRESSES WHERE WE

NEED TO GO WITH QUALITY CARE

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:38.668
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TALK

02:54:38.734 --> 02:54:40.336
ABOUT QUALITY CARE I THINK THE

02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:42.238
BILL IS MISSING A FEW ITEMS

02:54:42.305 --> 02:54:44.006
THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE

02:54:44.073 --> 02:54:45.241
WITH YOU TODAY I THINK FIRST

02:54:45.308 --> 02:54:46.943
AND FOREMOST I THINK IT'S FIRST

02:54:47.009 --> 02:54:49.245
IMPORTANT FOR -- THE STATE TO

02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:51.147
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE REASONABLE

02:54:51.214 --> 02:54:53.583
COSTS -- AND A PART OF THAT

02:54:53.649 --> 02:54:55.952
IS LOOKING AT -- WHAT'S WHAT'S

02:54:56.018 --> 02:54:58.054
STARTING TO BE REPORTED I HAD

02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.723

-- WHICH WE WORKED WITH --

02:55:06.195 --> 02:55:07.964
SENATOR STERN LAST YEAR ON SB

02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:09.699
SIX FIFTY LOOKS AT WAYS THAT

02:55:09.765 --> 02:55:11.200
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:55:11.267 --> 02:55:12.668
TRANSPARENT NURSING FACILITIES

02:55:12.735 --> 02:55:14.070
CAN BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:15.872
THEIR COSTS ARE AND WHAT THEIR

02:55:15.938 --> 02:55:17.440
TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:18.941
ARE WITH THEIR RELATED PARTIES

02:55:19.208 --> 02:55:20.710
SO ONCE WE'RE ABLE TO DETERMINE

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:22.912
KIND OF WHAT THOSE -- THOSE

02:55:22.979 --> 02:55:24.413
TRANSPARENT RESOURCES ARE HOW

02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:25.715
THEY'RE UTILIZING THOSE THOSE

02:55:25.781 --> 02:55:27.650
RESOURCES THEN WE CAN THEN

02:55:27.717 --> 02:55:29.018
TAKE THE NEXT STEP TO DETERMINE

02:55:29.085 --> 02:55:30.686
MAYBE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND

02:55:30.753 --> 02:55:31.854
WHAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE

02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:33.222
SPENDING ON PATIENT CARE SO WE

02:55:33.289 --> 02:55:34.657
THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT

02:55:34.724 --> 02:55:36.092
THE BILL AT LEAST AT THIS POINT

02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:38.294
IS PREMATURE AND TWO WE THINK

02:55:38.361 --> 02:55:39.829
THAT IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT ANY

02:55:39.896 --> 02:55:42.064
TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS ON -- WHAT

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:43.499
A FACILITY SPANS WE FIRST NEED

02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:45.067
TO MAKE SURE IF FOR ASSURING

02:55:45.134 --> 02:55:47.236
QUALITY CARE THAT FACILITIES

02:55:47.303 --> 02:55:48.471
-- PAID ADEQUATELY FOR THE

02:55:48.537 --> 02:55:50.373
MEDICAL PROGRAM AND I THINK IT'S

02:55:50.439 --> 02:55:51.507
IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE

02:55:51.574 --> 02:55:53.442
RESPECT TO OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

02:55:53.509 --> 02:55:55.511
-- OUR STATE GOVERNMENT OUR

02:55:55.578 --> 02:55:57.847
MEDICARE PROGRAM IS A PARTNER

02:55:57.914 --> 02:55:59.081
WITH NURSING FACILITIES THEY

02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:00.950
MAKE UP AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF

02:56:01.017 --> 02:56:02.218
THE PAYMENT FOR THOSE FACILITIES

02:56:02.285 --> 02:56:03.653
ISN'T A MANY CASES WE KNOW FOR

02:56:03.719 --> 02:56:05.488
A FACT THAT THEY UNDER PAY FOR

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:06.756
THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:08.824
SO I DID WE STRONGLY BELIEVE

02:56:08.891 --> 02:56:10.192
THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED

02:56:10.259 --> 02:56:12.495
AT -- TOGETHER BOTH WITH ARE

02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:13.996
WE MAKING SURE THAT OUR STATE

02:56:14.063 --> 02:56:15.131
GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE PROBABLY

02:56:15.197 --> 02:56:16.766
PAYING FOR PATIENT CARE BEFORE

02:56:16.832 --> 02:56:18.501
WE DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE

02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:20.369
APPROPRIATE TO BE SPENT OR NOT

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:22.872
SPENT AND THEN -- LASTLY I JUST

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:25.274
WANT TO MENTION THAT -- I'M

02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:29.045
REALLY I THINK THE KEY CONCERNS

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:31.314
THAT -- CENTER AT LEAST FOR --

02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:33.316
CALF IS AROUND THE DEFINITION OF

02:56:33.382 --> 02:56:34.650
WHAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE PATIENT

02:56:34.717 --> 02:56:36.752
CARE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW -- IN

02:56:36.819 --> 02:56:38.154
THAT DEFINITION LEAVES OUT WHAT

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:40.022
WE CONSIDER TO BE SOME IMPORTANT

02:56:40.089 --> 02:56:42.491
PATIENT CARE RELATED COSTS ONE

02:56:42.558 --> 02:56:45.094
BEING RENTS OR LEASES OTHERS

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:47.296
INSURANCE OTHER TYPES OF FEES

02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:48.898
ARE OVERSIGHT THAT ARE REQUIRED

02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:50.199
TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND THE

02:56:50.266 --> 02:56:52.835
LIGHTS ON AND ESPECIALLY RENTS

02:56:52.902 --> 02:56:54.236
AND LEASES UNDERSTAND THERE

02:56:54.303 --> 02:56:56.305
MIGHT BE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MUCH

02:56:56.372 --> 02:56:58.040
THAT IS OR OR WHAT THOSE AMOUNTS

02:56:58.107 --> 02:57:00.042
SHOULD BE -- BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY

02:57:00.109 --> 02:57:01.143
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:02.845

02:57:02.912 --> 02:57:05.247

FROM THAT CAME UP YESTERDAY

02:57:49.892 --> 02:57:51.460
I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:52.728
AND AND AND LOOK I DON'T I'M

02:57:52.795 --> 02:57:53.863
NOT GOING TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON

02:57:53.929 --> 02:57:54.897
THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:56.032
NOT APPROPRIATE THERE ARE SOME

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:58.000
VERY VERY GOOD OPERATORS OUT

02:57:58.067 --> 02:58:00.202
THERE BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE

02:58:00.269 --> 02:58:02.304
SOME OPERATORS THAT ARE NOT AND

02:58:02.371 --> 02:58:03.773
-- WHEN IT GETS TO THINGS LIKE

02:58:03.839 --> 02:58:05.541
RENTS WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN AN

02:58:05.608 --> 02:58:08.477
OPERATOR SETS UP A RELATED PARTY

02:58:08.944 --> 02:58:11.580
ENTITY TO CHARGE RENTS THEY'RE

02:58:11.647 --> 02:58:13.649
NOT DOING THAT TO GET THE

02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:15.251
BEST POSSIBLE RATE THEY'RE

02:58:15.317 --> 02:58:17.053
DOING THAT TO GET THE MOST

02:58:17.119 --> 02:58:18.687
PROFIT THEY CAN'T OUT OF THAT

02:58:19.422 --> 02:58:21.757
I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:58:22.091 --> 02:58:25.027
THE ENTRY OF VENTURE CAPITAL

02:58:25.227 --> 02:58:28.364
INTO THIS SPACE MY UNDERSTANDING

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:30.299
BASED ON INFORMATION I'VE

02:58:30.366 --> 02:58:31.434
READ ENOUGH I'M WRONG ON THIS

02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:33.202

CAP WAS GOING TO INTO THIS FOR

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:48.617
PROFIT SO THE IDEA THAT

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:49.585
THERE IS NOT THAT THAT THERE

02:58:49.652 --> 02:58:51.020
IS NO PROFIT AT THAT OR THE

02:58:51.087 --> 02:58:52.288
