WADE CROWFOOT ARE SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY JESSICA MORSE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SERGIO. ASSISTANT PROGRAM- BUDGET MANAGER AND STEVEN BENSON PRINCIPAL PROGRAMS PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST. MS KIRSTEN. ARE YOU OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. I AM WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME- SO WE HAVE IN COMMON- ON THAT PACKAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEAR I'M NOT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT WITH. RECOMMENDATIONS AND YOU SHOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE COPIES OF THAT AND THEY'RE ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION. THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF MERIT- THIS IS THIS IS PRETTY YEAH THEN THAT OF REALLY LARGE AND TO BE A WILD THAT THE STATE ETHICS IN RECENT YEARS SO ALL OF YOUR WELFARE OF I'VE JUST BEEN TERREL OB THAT HAVE A IN THIS- I WOULD LOOK WE ALSO THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SUPPORT A RANGE. OF ACTIVITIES THAT MAKE BOTH ARE NOT AND HE'S AND CAN YOU- THAT ARE CROFTERS MORE IS A TO WHY. AT PROPOSED IN THE PACK OF THE PACKAGE INCLUDES PROGRAMS BACKGROUND THIRD DIFFERENT PROGRAM ARE PROPOSED BE FINANCED WHY RANGE OF PRODUCTS RIGHT A DIFFERENT. OF THIS IS KIRSTEN WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF THE IN THE ROOM HEARING YOU- I NOT SURE IF THERE ANYTHING YOU DO ON A END BUT THERE IS. PLEASE DO. WE'RE TRYING TO ADJUST THE SOUND ON THE AND ALSO. OKAY I'LL TRY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE IS THIS HELPFUL YES IT IS OKAY OKAY ARE YOU JUST YELL AT US. BEGINNING FROM I THOUGHT ARE YOU CAN WHERE YOU USED. OKAY THANK YOU SOME- SO WELL OVER WE FIND THAT THE- WHILE THERE MAY MAY A LOT OF SENSE DO HAVE NAY RECOMMEND. FOR THE TO CONSIDER I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU MIGHT SPECIFIC CORPORATE PACKAGE I'M SO FIRST WE- THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER THE TOTAL OF FINE PROPOSED AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC. PROGRAMS IS CONSIST WITH ITS PRESS. SO I THAT THEN WE HAVE OUR THEM KEEP BACK THAT WE RECOMMEND A LOT CAN PRINT AT AND VULNERABLE TO ME- ID ASPECT NO THERE ARE COULD BE THAT ARE REALLY. HARD INTO VERY VOTER TO THESE. ARE SICK MAJOR IS THAT THE LETTER TO FOR ACTION ON HIS PROPOSED PACKAGE AND THIS WHEN DOES NOT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HELP. LEGISLATIVE DECISION A- THERE ARE A FEW KEY. THANK THEM FOR ME THAT WE THINK WOULD BE PARTICULARLY. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE TO THE SELLING IT FUNDING THIS. SO IT WOULD BE. FOR THE LATEST TO HAVE MORE DETAIL ON ROGRAM THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR USE FOR THE PACKAGE THERE REALLY ISN'T A OF ROOM FOR ABOUT AT THIS ON THE SPECIFIC OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WHILE MANY PROGRAMS THERE PROPOSED FINDING WE'RE- AS PART OF THAT WHILE PER PACK. THAT AND THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED. UNDERWENT A PATH BUT HERE THERE ARE NEW PROGRAM. LIKE DOES HAVE MILITARY THIS PROGRAM IS TO ZERO YAKKING THEY ARE NEW. I'M AND SOME OF THOSE INCREASE FOR EXAMPLE A STEP FOR THE- TO. OF WHAT HE BY- AS AS WE- FIND- AND- THIS DEMONSTRATE FOREST. SO WHILE THE NEED FOR. WE THINK GENERALLY IMPORTANT. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- ONE COM ON HOW EXPECTED BE EMPLOYED. UNDER RATIONALE FOR THE FOR SPENDING AMOUNT HELD INTERACT EXISTING. PROGRAMS SEVEN SOME CASES THEY'RE MAKING THE PROGRAMS I COULD FIND. TAKES OF THINGS. WE THINK THOSE ARE REALLY. QUESTION THAT THE LETTER OLD TO BUY AND- BEFORE ACTION PROVIDE SOME TIME FOR. THE TO COME FORWARD WITH A DETAILS BE VERY. ALSO WE NOTE THAT AND THERE ARE I KNOW PROGRAM THAT WERE FINE AS PART OF PASSED. THERE PROPOSED BRITISH FUNDING AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE. I MEAN EVEN THE IMPORTANT TEN ONLY FOR ME. ON WHAT PLANNED FOR THAT. BY THINK SOME OF QUESTIONS THAT BUT- ALSO I THINK EVEN FOR. ON PROVIDED FIND. OVERSIGHT HEARING THE MINISTRATION IS REALLY MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN GETTING EARLY ACTION FINDING OUT THE BEST AJORITY OF. HIS HAVE GOTTEN OUT BUT AT LEAST AS OF DECEMBER ONLY ABOUT 7% OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FUNDING HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO PROJECTS AND OF COURSE ONCE. SPENDING IS COMMITTED IT STILL. TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THOSE- PROJECTS ACTUALLY- BE COMPLETED SO. NOT SURPRISINGLY IN MANY CASES INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOMES OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY AND- IT'S PRETTY LIMITED AT THIS POINT- WE DO EXPECT THAT MISSION OPERATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE COMING MONTHS WE THINK THAT THAT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD HELP INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING- AND WE WOULD KNOW IN PARTICULAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE AB REQUIRED ADMINISTRATION TO COME FORWARD WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT. AND THE FIRST OF THOSE ANNUAL REPORTS IS EXPECTED IN APRIL AND SO WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL INCLUDE SOME REALLY HELPFUL INFORMATION. ON WHAT HAPPENED WITH PASSED FUNDING THAT CAN HELP INFORM. FUTURE DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE OKAY WELL WE ARE THERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN BETTER AT GETTING FINDING OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY. ARE THERE SOME THAT HAVE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED MORE AND MAYBE THEY'RE AREAS YOU WANT INVEST MORE MONEY- RELATIVE TO OTHER AREAS. WHEN YOU SEE HOW IN FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ALL TO THE TO FUNDING. SO THIS. CLOSE ISN'T THAT POINT BILLION BASIC BE EQUALLY AND THE NEXT TO AND BUDGET YEAR YOU'RE ONE. I'M REALLY WE THAT THERE'S A TRADE AND CHECK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT APPROACH IN SOME CASES- FOR EXAMPLE THERE SENATE TO THAT REALLY REQUIRES SUSTAINED FUNDING NOT JUST ONE TIME FUNDING TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE. EXAMPLES ABOUT OR THINGS LIKE SOME OF THE FORCE HEALTHCARE PROJECTS- DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND IT TAKES A PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT- YOU GET NOT JUST BENTENG BRIGHT YOU KNOW MEDITATION GROWS BACK ON THOSE PROJECTS HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED. THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OCCUR WE HAVE JUST THE SCALE OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ALSO IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT SO IT'S KIND OF AN ON GOING KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL PROBABLY WANT TO FIND- SO YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IN SOME CASES ONGOING FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE- WE DON'T THINK YOU THANK GOD YOU'RE F. IT'S PROPOSED. TO LAST FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT THAT- THE GENERAL FUND COMPONENT IS ONLY A TWO YEAR PEACE. I'M AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL AT THIS POINT ON WHAT'S HAPPENED SO IT MAY BE HARD TO FUNDING DECISIONS FOR BEYOND JUST THE BUDGET YEAR. BURKE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE HOME GARDENING PROGRAM WHICH IS JUST GETTING OFF THE GROUND NOW VERY VALUABLE AND POTENTIALLY BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW IT'S GONNA WORK. AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OKAY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S A NEW PROGRAM THE BUDGET THAT YOU JUST FUNDED LAST YEAR IT'S JUST GETTING OFF THE GROUND. SO YOU CAN SEND TO YOURSELF BUT YOU ALSO CONSIDER TO SPENDING ONE YEAR- SEEING HOW. YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITHOUT TENS AND THEN MAKING- ADDITIONAL DECISIONS LATER. THE FOURTEENTH ARMY RECOGNITION WE HAVE A THAT ALLEGED. MEMBER TO PROVIDE STATURE GUIDANCE TO. THE IN. YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME. CAN YOU ITS OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES. IN THIS. SO WE REALLY COMMENDED. ON THE COMMITTEE THAT A LOT OF OVERSIGHT. ON THE- ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE BUT WE THINK THAT'S GONNA BE. CONTINUE TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WE SPENT A LOT OF MANY OF THE STATE EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE IS REALLY DEDICATED A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THIS AREA- IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT AREA AND WE THINK IT'S GOING TO. BE CRITICAL. AND LEGISLATURE. THESE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW FUNDS SO REALLY IN. YOU CAN TO MONITOR THE BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION PROGRESS. I'M INCLUDING THESE. AND GAME LAST LEARNED TO INFORM FUTURE. I'M SO THOSE ARE OUR MAIN RECOMMEND. CRAPPIE TAKING QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. YES MISTER SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON AB ELEVEN OH THREE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ONLINE CLASSES. NO. THAT WOULD BE BETTER DRESS ALLEN IS THAT BACK I RECALL- OKAY ONE. GOOD MORNING THIS IS STEPHEN ABOUT WITH FIVE I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT THE TO ONLINE IT JUST REQUIRE THE COURSE TO BE DEVELOPED. WE ARE PROPOSING ONLINE COURSES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE QUICKEST. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET THE COURSES AVAILABLE- FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS IN MOST TIMELY TIMELY MANNER. OF ALL THE BILL PROPOSALS THAT THE BCPS WHY IS THIS THE ONLY ONE THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ON TIME. IF IT CAN GO ONLINE. WELL THERE'S THAT REQUIREMENT IN THE LEGISLATION THAT THERE BE SOME OVERSIGHT FROM STATEWIDE TRAINING- EIGHT OUT OF THE NAME THE LAST TIME I HAD SORRY BUT THERE'S SOME OVERSIGHT FROM STATEWIDE TRAINING- GROUP THAT HAS TO BE DONE AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO DEVELOP THE COURSE CURRICULUM SO IN TALKING WITH THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND LOOKING AT THE TIMELINE TO DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM. TO GET THE OVERSIGHT REVIEW- THAT'S NECESSARY AND THEN TO GET IT POSTED AN AVAILABLE ONLINE- THAT THAT'S JUST THE TIMELINE THAT THEY CAME UP WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TALKING TO MEMBER DOLLY THAT THERE IS OTHER COUNTIES THAT ALREADY HAVE THE THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE WOULD BE JUST AS EASY TO GO GET IT FROM THEM AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT THAT. COULD CHANGE THE WILL OF THE WAGON- I WOULD NEED TO TALK WITH THE OFFICE STATE FARM MARSHALS TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE EXISTING-PROGRAMS- HAVE TRAINING CURRICULUM AND HOW THAT MATCHES WITH THE- REQUIREMENTS WHAT THEY NEED TO SET UP. FOLLOW UP WITH ME TOO BECAUSE THERE'S ACTUALLY NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL ANOTHER COUNTY STARTED TO ANOTHER STATE AGENCIES DOING IT. THAT WE SHOULD ALREADY BE ABLE-TO IMPLEMENT A PRETTY QUICK. AND NOT HAVE TO POSTPONED UNTIL JULY TWENTY FOURTH NEGATIVE. THANK YOU. FOR YEAH I WE WILL CERTAINLY. UP ON IT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE- RATING TIMELINE PROHIBITS THE PASSES FROM BEING ABLE TO BE YOU KNOW A PROGRAM THE USE OF AS I RECALL THE- BILL AS IT. PASSED THE LAWS FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS TO STILL FUNCTION EVEN BEFORE THE TRAINING IS AVAILABLE SO. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WAY BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THAT OBSOLETE FOR MARSHALL WE CAN GET BACK WITH DROPS. MISREAD DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I DO AND I DO CAME IN FOR THE HEARING ABOUT PORTS SO I MISS MOST OF YOUR PRESENTATION SO THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE FOR THIS QUESTION. JUST LET ME KNOW GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE EXPENDITURE PLAN. SO IF THEY CAN IS THIS AT THE RIGHT TIME TO ASK THAT. YEAH OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS THAT A CLEARLY. POST WILDFIRE. RESTORATION IS GOING TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M HEARING A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM A LOT OF GROUPS ABOUT FIRST OF ALL MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER IS DONE IN TERMS OF RESTORATION PROVIDES NATIVE PLANTS AND HABITAT FOR OUR NATIVE ANIMALS AND JUST I CAN JUST SAY ANECDOTALLY WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENED CERTAINLY IN THE PAST WITH REFORESTATION AT LEAST IN MY AREA WAS CHAPARRAL. THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE HISTORY OF PEOPLE PLANTING NON NATIVE PLANTS- INAPPROPRIATE PLANTS HAVE BECOME WE'VE LATER OR NOT OPEN NOT PLANTING AT ALL AND ALLOWING FOR INVASIVE PLANTS TO COME BACK- I'M WONDERING WHAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT DO YOU EXPECT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE HAVE FOR THESE REFORESTATION POLICIES TO NOT ONLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE APPROPRIATE AND DONE USING. THE BEST SCIENCE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S. MADE OF BIODIVERSITY BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE SO THAT IF WE DO EXPECT. THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MIX OF WHAT PLANTS CAN SURVIVE. THAT WE DON'T THAT WE THAT WE DO ALL OF OUR EFFORTS WITHOUT RESILIENCY IN MIND SO THAT WE PROTECT OUR INVESTMENTS AS WELL. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND I WOULD THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS PROBABLY UP FRONT WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE IS DOING- SO THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION IS PROPOSED AS PART OF PACKAGE FOR REFORESTATION. LIKE FIFTY MILLION EACH YEAR. I'M STILL GET A LOT OF PROMISE I THINK THAT THERE IS- PRETTY BROAD. THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON MAKING SURE WE DON'T GET TYPE CONVERSION MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE APPROPRIATE. TYPES OF- PLANTS THAT ARE NATIVE AND THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO BE RESILIENT- THAT ARE THAT ARE. BACK IN THAT LANDSCAPE AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE VERY SEVERE WILDFIRES- BUT I THINK IT'S- JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE IS COMFORTABLE WITH IT. AND I THINK I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS OF THEIR PROPOSAL FOR THAT FIND THOSE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. SO I THINK I AM PERHAPS ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A PLAN FOR HOW THEY EXPECT TO USE THAT AND THEN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INTERACT WITH SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS. TO HELP INFORM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE DOLLARS I'M SAID THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DONE THAT THAT CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT- CONSISTENT WITH. BEST PRACTICES AND ITS PRIORITIES AS WELL. REALLY I'M A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND THEN OF COURSE I'M HERE THERE'S ONGOING MONITORING AS WELL BUT I'M YOU KNOW IT'S BETTER IF WE GET A THAT GET IT RIGHT UP FRONT RIGHT- MAKE SURE TO DO IT RIGHT UP FRONT AND I AND I. AM EXPECTING MINISTRATION PROBABLY HAS HAD SOME PLANS THERE BUT- I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF DETAIL YET. I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS VERY COMMITTED TO BIODIVERSITY SO I WOULD EXPECT THEM CERTAINLY TO SUPPORT THESE GOALS- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHATEVER FLOWS VERY NATURALLY CAN EXECUTIVE BRANCH AN UP AND DOWN THAT WE- ALSO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK. REALLY HAVE OVERSIGHT AND REALLY HAVE TRAINING BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN JUST REALLY EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S DONE WRONG AND I'LL JUST SAY ONE OTHER THING IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONCERN FROM. FOLKS- FROM UC DAVIS AND OTHERS WHO STUDY WILDFIRE AND. RISSOIDAE REFORESTATION AND RESETTING NATIVE PLANTS. THAT SOME OF THE- BROAD STROKES THAT WE DO WITH PAUL. THAT MAY WORK OKAY IN SORT OF NORTHERN. FOR A THAT AREA ARE STILL UP I STILL YOU. IN SOME WAYS AND CHAPARRAL AREAS IN SOUTHERN CAL. WITH DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO. HABITS AND A LOT OF EXAMPLE THAT THEY'VE SHOWN ME. WHERE NATIVE HABITAT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S BEEN DISRUPTED OR- BURNED IN APPROPRIATELY- AND ALLOWING FOR- INVASIVE TO JUST TAKE OVER. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE USING. OUR SCIENTISTS AND THAT YOU KNOW CAL FIRE WHO'S BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN IS RIGHTFULLY ON. FIRE RESILIENCY ALSO HAS SORT OF BEEN BEDDED PEOPLE WHOSE. GOAL IS BIODIVERSITY. AND PROTECTION OF OUR NATIVE- ARE NATIVE- ECO SYSTEMS IN THE MIX AT ALL TIMES SO THAT THE WHATEVER THEY DO. DOESN'T THAT WE'RE WORKING AT THE SAME PURPOSE AND I GUESS THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE. MORE DELIBERATE AND MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HEAR THE LEVEL OF ALARM. UP FROM SOME OF OUR SCIENTISTS GIVEN THE THREATS OF. CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE SAME HABITATS THAT WE JUST HAVE TO BE SURE THAT. IN OUR VIGOR TO PROTECT. LIFE AND PROPERTY WITH FIRE WHICH OF COURSE. IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T SACRIFICE OUR COLLEGE AT THE SAME TIME. SO THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS- AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE ASKING THEM AND I. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE- BEGAN BY SUGGESTING THAT WE WAIT UNTIL ALL THE PRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BEFORE IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH MEMBERS- I WILL DO THAT- BIKESHARE FONG YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE SOME INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. NO OKAY THEN I THEN I WOULD ASK THAT WE JUST HOLD OUR QUESTIONS. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. IT'S RIGHT AT. THE ABSOLUTELY MY- IT THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME OUT OF SO- THAT MORE DON'T WE ON- I SECRETARY CROW FOR TO- AND TO HEAR PRESENT. THANKS SO MUCH CHAIRED AND OF THE COMMITTEE AND CHAIR AS ONE OF SURE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY YEAH WE COULD. WE CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. YEAH I'VE GOT THIS. LEARNING SOME OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES THAT WE CONTINUE TO FACE ON WILDFIRE BUT ALSO POINTED TO OUR COLLECTIVE PROGRESS WHICH IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU MADE LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET BUT ALSO FRANKLY AS YOU SAY CHAIR HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONING FOR MANY YEARS. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH AND FRIEDMAN AND I'LL I'LL I'LL ADDRESS THOSE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT I'M GONNA PRESENT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE CONTEXT OF OUR BUDGET PRESENTATION HERE TODAY I'M GOING TO BE ASLEEP GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAST FIRE SEASON OUR STRATEGY AMIDST WORSENING WILDFIRE CONDITIONS- HOW INVESTMENTS HAVE BEGUN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN OF COURSE WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING I HEAR TODAY THROUGH YOUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. SO AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON IS OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A ROUGH ONE. FOR OF THE STATE'S LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY BURNED LAST SEASON. EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WILDFIRES BURNING OVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION ACRES. MUCH OF THOSE ACRES EXPERIENCING HIGH SEVERITY BURNING THAT ESSENTIALLY DESTROYED. HOMES AND COMMUNITIES IN THEIR PATH BUT THEN OBVIOUSLY THE ECOSYSTEM AS WELL. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY TO WILDFIRES ACTUALLY CRESTED THE SIERRA NEVADA. HASN'T HAPPENED IN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF OUR STATE HISTORY THAT WAS OF COURSE THE DIXIE IN THE CALDOR FIRES. IN THOSE FIRES. THOSE WILDFIRES WERE JUMPING LITERALLY FIVE HUNDRED FOOT CLIFFS. THERE WERE FLAMES ARE ADVANCING THREE MILES AHEAD OF THE WILDFIRE FRONT. AND IN CERTAIN AREAS WERE BURNING OVER TWICE IN THE SAME FIRE. WE KNOW TRAGICALLY COMMUNITIES OF GRIZZLY FELT FLAT AND GREENVILLE WERE DECIMATED. A LOT OF DESTRUCTION OF OUR UPPER WATERSHEDS WHICH PROVIDES A THE BEGINNING OF OUR SORT OF WATER SYSTEM FOR ABOUT 60% OF THE STATE'S WATER SUPPLY. TOSE WATERSHEDS EXPERIENCE THAT HIGH SEVERITY VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRE BASED ON HOW HOT WILDFIRES ARE BURNING NOW. WE LOST 15220% OF OUR INCREDIBLE GIANT SEQUOIAS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I SO THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE WORSENING CONDITIONS FOR WILDFIRE. REMARKABLY THEY ALTHOUGH I KNOW CIVILIAN LIVES LOST I IN THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON FRANKLY DUE TO HER ROIC ACTIONS OF CAL FIRE AND THEIR SISTER AGENCIES. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN RESPONSE CAPACITY I AM PROUD TO CALL CAL FIRE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING FORCE IN THE WORLD. I'M GOING TO COLLECTIVELY CONTINUE TO BUILD THEIR CAPACITY MORE FIREFIGHTERS MORE EQUIPMENT MORE TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S DISCUSSED IN OTHER PORTION OF THE BUDGET BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE CAN'T RESPOND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS WILDFIRE CRISIS AND YOU ALL HAVE BEEN GIVING VOICE TO THAT REALITY FOR MANY YEARS. NOW WE KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE PROACTIVE UP FRONT ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE GETTING WORSE THE GOOD NEWS IS THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE GETTING BETTER. WE SAW THE LAST WILD FIRE SEASON EFFORTS LIKE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS PRESCRIBED FIRE HOME HARDENING ACTUALLY WORK TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEM. GREAT EXAMPLE IS RIGHT AROUND SOUTH LAKE TAHOE WHERE I WALKED. LINES ARE THE PROTECTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND ALLOWED. FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND TO PROTECT THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THOSE WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS THAT WERE PUT IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SIMILAR FROM FUEL BREAKS PROTECTED THE COMMUNITY OF POLLOCK PINES. DOWN THE FIFTY. SO THESE PROJECTS SHOW US THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD OUR RESILIENCE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TAKE ACTIONS WITHIN COMMUNITIES ARE MORE HOME HARDENING MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE BETTER PLANNING WE NEED TO TAKE ACTIONS AROUND COMMUNITIES MORE OF THESE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS THAT ALLOW WILDFIRES TO MAKE A STAND PROTECTING COMMUNITIES. AND GIVE THOSE RESIDENTS TIME TO EVACUATE AND OF COURSE LANDSCAPE LEVEL PROJECTS THAT BOTH REDUCE THAT SEVERITY OR THE HEAT AND SIZE OF THESE WILDFIRES AND THEN ALSO HELP US PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE FOREST AND THE LANDSCAPES. WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS TO BE BASED ON REGIONAL PRIORITIES. I AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN POINTED OUT OUT IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WORKS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. OESN'T WORK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND VICE VERSA SO ALL OF THESE WERE ALL THESE PROJECTS WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT ARE BASED ON THE NEEDS THAT CHALLENGES THE OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH REGION. AND OF COURSE ALL OF THIS WORK NEEDS TO BE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE WHICH IS A VALUE THAT WE ALL SHARE IN COMMON. NOW LOOK LET'S BE HONEST WE KNOW CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO THIS ALONE YOU KNOW TE FACTS WHICH ARE- 57% OF OUR FOREST LANDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE STATE ONLY OWNS 3% OF THOSE FOREST LANDS BUT YET OUR STATE GOT A BUDGET HAS SUBSIDIZED MANAGEMENT ON THOSE FEDERAL FOREST LANDS. BACK IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR NEW SOME SIGNED WHAT WAS A HISTORIC SHARED STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME CREATED SOME VERY CLEAR SHARED COMMITMENTS THAT WE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR INCLUDING A MILLION ACRES OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECTS ON OUR LANDSCAPES EACH YEAR BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT SETS OT ESSENTIALLY LIKE A TWENTY YEAR PATHWAY FOR. SHARED COORDINATED EFFORTS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. WE BREATHED LIFE INTO THAT AGREEMENT THROUGH RESHAPING THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE TASK FORCE WHICH IS CHAIRED BY MYSELF AND THAT HEAD OF THE U. S. FOR SERVICE IN THE REGION. BUT ALSO INCLUDES OUR COMPANIES ARE CITIES OUR STATE CONSERVANCIES ARE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS ARE ACADEMICS REALLY BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER WITH AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. THAT TASK FORCE DEVELOPED A VERY CLEAR AND SPECIFIC ACTION PLAN. WITH NINETY NINE ACTIONS THAT WE ARE TAKING TO BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. AND THAT WE WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. SENATE BILL FOUR FIFTY SIX LAST YEAR CODIFIED THAT ACTION PLAN AND REQUIRED. BOTH WE SUBMIT AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN BUT THEN ON ANNUAL REPORT. SO THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT THAT YOU ALL MADE LAST YEAR THIS A STORK INVESTMENT. I IS ALL FOCUSED ON ON AN ENABLING THOSE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE SET FORTH IN THE ACTION PLAN. WELL GOOD NEWS ON THE FEDERAL FRONT WITH JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE MOTHER AGENCY FOR THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE. ANNOUNCED TEN YEAR STRATEGY OR ACTION PLAN FOR IMPROVED WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IN FEDERAL FORESTS. GLAD TO REPORT THAT THIS ESSENTIALLY MIRRORS WHAT THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE AND OUR ACTION PLAN AND ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO BE MANIFESTED IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THAT SHARED. TASK FORCE WE WERE GRATIFIED THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT CAME TO ST BERNARD DINO IN RECENT DAYS AND ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NEW FUNDING FOR OUR RECOVERY AND REFORESTATION. HOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREEMAN'S POINT. SO INVESTING AT SCALE IS ESSENTIAL AS MISS CHRISTINE ARE POINTED OUT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS THIS CAN'T BE A ONE OFF INVESTMENT. THE STAFF SIZE THE SCALE THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM REQUIRES SKILLED INVESTMENT OVER TIME. IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU ALLOCATED LAST YEAR WAS HAS BEEN A DIFFERENCE MAKER- THERE'S OF OURSE THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING THAT YOU FIND IT. TOOK REMARKABLE EXTRAORDINARY STOP OF EARLY FUNDING R. FOUR FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR- FOREST OUR RESILIENCE PROJECT WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECT. I'M REALLY GLAD TO REPORT THAT THAT. TURNED INTO THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN NEW WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECTS. SO YOUR ABILITY DO APPROVAL OUT FUNDING IN APRIL LET US GET A JUMP START ON THOSE PROJECTS MANY OF WHICH MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OUR STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY USE THAT FUNDING TO FIND A GRAZING PROJECTS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. AND THAT PROJECT ACTUALLY STOP THE A LETHAL FIRE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. IN ITS TRACKS AND ONE OF THE FRONT OF THE FIRE I PROTECTING HISTORIC STRUCTURES. AND I YEAH IN A COMMUNITIES AROUND. OUR SAN DIEGO CONSERVANCY I WAS ABLE TO USE THAT FUNDING FOR A WOOD CHIPPING PROGRAM TO CREATE THE SPENT DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND TWO TWO HUNDRED LOW INCOME HOMES IN SAN DIEGO. AND- SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY USED FUNDING FOR AN ARSON WATCH PROGRAM THAT FOUND ILLEGAL FIREWORKS OVER THE FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND AND THEN PREVENTED IGNITIONS IN THAT SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS ON RED FLAG DAYS. SO THAT EARLY ACTION FUNDING IS ALREADY DEMONSTRATING SUCCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARD THIS PROVIDING MORE I'VE- INFORMATION ON THAT. ALSO ACTIONS THAT YOU TOOK AT THE LEGISLATURE SHIFTED OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO ALLOW THAT THOSE PROJECTS TO GET DONE MORE QUICKLY. LEGISLATIVE. CONTRACTING RELIEF ENABLED TEN DATE. ON RATHER A ONE YEAR TURNAROUND THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT. EXPEDITES THE WORK. GRANT TIMELINES WITHIN OUR AGENCIES WERE REDUCED. TO A FEW MONTHS RATHER THAN THE SIX TO NINE MONTH PROCESS THAT IT USUALLY TOOK. AND IMPORTANTLY WITH. A LOT OF DIRECTION AND NOW BECAUSE EVEN THE LEGISLATURE WE FUNDED SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WERE WAITING TO START. THAT'S THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING THEN OF COURSE- YOU ALL A FOLLOW UP IN SEPTEMBER AND FUNDED NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS REALLY DESIGNED FOR SCALE AND TO BE SPENT OVERTIME. I'M GLAD TO REPORT ACTUALLY EVEN AN UPDATE ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S UPDATE TO YOU THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE NINE EIGHTY EIGHT. HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED AND OUR VISION WITH THAT IS TO SAY IS TO OBVIOUSLY GET AS MUCH FUNDING OUT THE DOOR AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO CREATE BEGIN TO CREATE A PIPELINE OF PROJECTS. BASED ON REGIONAL PRIORITIES. THOSE REGIONAL PRIORITIES REGIONAL PRIORITY SETTING- IS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS THANKS TO A SPECIFIC PROGRAM THAT YOU FUNDED CALL THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. WE'RE LAUNCHING THREE PILOT PROGRAMS I'M HOME HARDENING IN SAN DIEGO LAKE AND SHASTA COUNTIES WE'VE NOW GOT A LIDAR REMOTE SENSING ON TWO THIRDS OF OUR CRITICAL WATERSHED THANKS TO SCIENCE FUNDING THAT YOU. THAT YOU ALLOCATED THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE A U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY FEDERAL FUNDING FOR. JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK APPROVED THROUGH THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND I ACTUALLY BUSINESS. FINANCING FOR. BUSINESSES FOR- THAT ARE TO TAKE THIS BUDGET. OUT OF THE FOREST THAT'S BEING. REMOVED FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PURPOSES AND PUT IT TO ECONOMIC USE. AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAVE FIVE PILOT PROJECTS TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THAT WOODY FEEDSTOCK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS. AND THEN LASTLY THAT'S CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY ONE STOP SHOP FOR PERMITTING FIRST SEEK WHAT FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE PERMITS AND FOR WATER BOARD PERMITS- IS NOW IN ACTION AND IT'S STARTING TO BE USED I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE USE OF THE CHALVEY T. P. OVER COMING YEARS TO. EXPEDITE PROJECTS. ULTIMATELY THAT FUNDING THAT YOU ALLOCATED LAST YEAR. NOT ONLY GOES TO CAL FIRE WHICH IS OF COURSE OUR STATE'S PRIMARY FOR STREET DEPARTMENT BUT TO TWENTY ONE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FORTY PROGRAMS. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT. SO THEN MOVING TO THIS YEAR AND OF COURSE THE PRESENTATION TODAY OUR CURRENT BUDGET REQUEST OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS. I MAKE INVESTMENTS CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT. LET US MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS ACTION PLAN BASED ON REGIONAL PRIORITIES AND THEN I HAS POINTED OUT ACTUALLY FUND SOME NEW PROGRAMS. SO JUST QUICKLY THE BREAKDOWN OF THE OVERALL BUDGET IS UP FOR OUR RESILIENT FORESTS AND LANDSCAPES FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDES A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO US. SUPPORT FOR SMALL LANDOWNERS TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THEIR LANDS. IN FUNDING FOR THIS THIS WORK ON STATE LAND HOLDINGS LIKE OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE LANDS AND OUR STATE PARKS. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A NEW PROGRAM FOR REFORESTATION RECOGNIZING THAT THE CRITICAL NEED. FOR TO REFOREST ARE THESE THESE LANDS ARE THE BOTH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER THE FIRES. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE PROTECTIVE FUEL BREAKS FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY HARDENING AGAIN WHICH WE EXPECT TO LEVERAGE MORE FEDERAL FUNDING- A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TARGETED REGIONAL INVESTMENTS. THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FOR SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND ULTIMATELY FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR- FOR SECTOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO GET MORE OF THESE BUSINESSES ACTUALLY UTILIZING THE VEGETATION THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE FOREST. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING TOTALLY AGREE THAT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH WILL FOLLOW UP ON YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED LIKE A LASER I'VE BEEN PERSONALLY FOCUSED ON DRIVING THIS PROGRESS FOR IT AND I AM PROUD OF OUR PROGRESS A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING DETAILS WITH YOU ON HOW AREPROPOSED ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. WILL PROPEL MORE PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD. THANKS SO MUCH CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DID TO. YOUR DEPUTY SECRETARY MORE SO HAVE- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FORCE THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU- THEN THAT WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR STEPHEN BANDS WITH THE CURRENT FINANCE I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD BY WAY OF PRESENTATION AND THE SECRETARY DID THAT OBVIOUSLY PHENOMENAL JOB OF THAT SO I JUST BE AVAILABLE AS WELL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT MAYBE. GREAT THANK YOU THEM NOW WILL I GO BACK TO OUR QUESTIONS TONIGHT I THINK MS RIVAS- WAS. WAITING WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND MR FONG SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT US FOR A MOMENT- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS FOR THIS UPDATE- I- LIKE TEARING- HOW EARLY ACTION FUNDS- WERE BEING USED LAST YEAR THANK YOU FOR THOSE UPDATES- I HAVE COMMENTS ON THE- WOODY BIOMASS TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY- YOU KNOW I. HOPE THAT WE GET MORE CLARITY ON OR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT ON HOW THOSE FUNDS LIKE WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR THOSE FUNDS- AND- HOW WILL WE KNOW HOW OLD THE BIOMASS IS BEING PROCESSED. YOU KNOW HOW WILL WE BE TRACKING THAT- AND IT'S JUST. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CLARITY RIGHT NOW IN THAT ITEM. THE END OF YOUR QUESTION SO WHAT IF I AM NOT TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY IS REALLY ADDRESSING A GROWING CRISIS IN THE FOREST WE HAD TO DEVOTE AN ENTIRE FIRE ENGINES CHIU SLASH PILES AND REMEMBER SOME OF THE SLASH PILES ARE THE SIZES OF LARGE BUILDINGS SMALL STRIP MALL- AND AT THE FOR SERVICE AT ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. SLASH PILES IN THE TAHOE BASIN ALONE- SO DURING THESE ACTIVE WILDFIRES WE'RE HAVING TO DEVELOP FIRE ENGINES CHIU OUTRANKS YOU ARE ENSURE THAT THOSE SLASH PILES DON'T COMPLICATE AND IGNITE DURING CATASTROPHIC FIRES- SO CUTE YOU CANCER PART OF THE IS THIS ENTIRE. WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WERE SETTING UP AROUND MOVING WHAT HE BY A MASK OUT OF THE FOREST INTO BETTER PROGRAMS SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN IN WHAT PROCESSING BUSINESSES THROUGH THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE FUND THAT'S LAUNCHING SUCH AS INVESTMENTS WE MADE LAST YEAR IN LAUNCHING- WE FEEDSTOCK AGGREGATION PILOTS- THROUGH THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH- BE ABLE TO HELP. CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO START CREATING DEMAND TO MOVE THAT WHAT OUT OF THE FOREST SO THIS TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY IN THE- WALL- IN THE SUITE OF EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO GET A SLASH PILES TO HIRE DESTINATION. THE THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF WHO'S GOING TO QUALIFYING AND WHAT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE THAT WILL BE WORKED OUT IN THE GRANT GUIDELINES- AS THAT PROGRAM GETS DEVELOPED AS THIS IS A NEW INITIATIVE. BUT WE WANT TO CONVEY TO THE LEGISLATURE AS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS- A TOOL TO HELP US ADDRESS AN EMERGENCY CRISIS TO HELP MOVE EXISTING- SLASH PILES AND SLASH PILES THAT ARE BEING CREATED FROM POST FIRE SALVAGE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES- OUT OF. OUT OF. THE FOREST SO THE THAT WE- ONE MORE TOOL TO HELP CREATE. AT THE AGE THAT THIS FIRE HE'S AND FUTURE BUYERS HE'S ARE LEFT. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME. BUT THANK YOU MISTER SHE- I DON'T OF THIS QUESTION WERE JUST GO FIRST GROUP- YOU'D MENTION THE SB FORTY SIX FOR. THAT TO IN APRIL SO IS- IS THAT REPORT IN THE DRAFTING STAGES. CAN YOU GIVE US A TEASE IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS IT WHAT'S IN IT. YEAH SURE THING THIS IS ASPECT AWAY CROWFOOT SO ABSOLUTELY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE LOT I MEAN THE TEASER IS A LOT OF SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. THE ACTION PLAN CALLS FOR A NUMBER OF SORT OF KEY STRATEGIES TO MEET OUR OUR GOALS INCLUDING THAT MILLION ACRE TARGET INCLUDING A STRATEGY TO INTRODUCE MORE SAFE PRESCRIBED FIRE MY TO DO A BETTER JOB SUPPORTING PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO MANAGE. THEIR LAND. REALLY AS A BROAD SET OF STRATEGIES OUR TASK FORCE MEETS EVERY OTHER MONTH IT INCLUDES UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE GOT AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. OUR LEADER OF THAT TASK FORCE PATRICK RIGHT IS BASED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND DRIVING AT THIS PROGRESS SO I THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE I THINK A REALLY SOLID REPORT THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE SPECIFIC AREAS OF PROGRESS AND REALLY MAKING THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BUDGET THAT YOU ALL ARE LLOCATING AND THAT THE ACTIONS WE KNOW NEED TO BE TAKEN. THAT'S GREAT- IN TERMS OF- HE SAID A MILLION A MILLION ACRES TARGET MEANS A WE CLOSE WHERE WE HOW HOW WOULD YOU HOW WE GAUGING- WHERE WE ARE. YES THERE IS SO AS I AS I POINTED OUT THE IN THE STAIR SHARED STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT YOU KNOW ONE COMMITMENT THERE IS THIS MILLION ACRES A PROJECT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS. OBVIOUSLY MORE AND MORE PROJECTS ARE GETTING ON THE GROUND ONE THING THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW IS ACCOUNTING FOR THESE PROJECTS ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. HISTORICALLY THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE CENTRAL PART OF ACCOUNTING PLATFORM TO REALLY MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF PROJECTS AND PROJECT AREAS THAT WE'RE DOING SO YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE FOREST SERVICE HOW THE WAY THAT THEY THEY RECORDED DACHAU FIGHTER ARE CONSERVANCIES ARE LOCAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AT CETERA SO. TO GET TO MORE SPECIFIC ANSWER IN TERMS OF OVERALL PROJECT ACRES REALLY BUILDING A SHARED PLATFORM. TO CTUALLY MEASURE IT DOES PROJECT IDENTIFY WHAT PROJECTS ARE HAPPENING AND MEASURE THE SIZE AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THOSE PROJECTS AND- THAT THAT WILL BE ONE- YEAH THAT UPDATE ON IN THAT PAPERWORK. OKAY SO I JUST WANTED THAT I DON'T WANT TO DWELL ON THIS BUT THAT THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION- THAT WAS ALLOCATE ALLOCATED LAST YEAR. OR THE LAST BUDGET AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE ASKING FOR SIX OR MILLION SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A SPECIFIC NUMBER. LISTED RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE ACREAGE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN. DONE. YEAH I WOULD SAY YES AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOWWE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS ACROSS A- VARIETY OF METRICS. INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE YEAH HOME HARDENING STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS ETCETERA SO. PROJECT AREAS ARE ONE IMPORTANT METRIC WHERE WE DEMONSTRATE OUR PROGRESS AND WILL BE. MEASURING ASSESSMENT AGAINST OTHER METRICS AS WELL OKAY SO THERE'S JUST IT WITHIN THAT REPORT TO ME I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF METRICS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE- YOU MEET. I'M USING THE METRIC THAT YOU LISTED WHICH IS. THE MILLION ACRES BY TWENTY FIVE SO. I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SEX THERE. BUT YOU YOU DID MENTION THE- THAT YOUR HOPE IS THAT. IT WOULD BE MORE. USAGE OF THAT THAT THE CAL THE G. P. PROGRAM. DO WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PROJECTS WERE SUBMITTED. TO THAT STREAMLINED PROCESS AND- HOW MANY PROJECTS TO EXPECT TO BE IN. THE PIPELINE- MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I IT'S HELPFUL OF JESSICA JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF A- I KNOW YOU YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT CAL BTP BUT FOR OTHERS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEN. YOU KNOW HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT IT'S YOU SAID RIGHT NOW. PERFECT. I'M SORRY COUNTY P. AS A TWENTY MILLION EAKER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REVIEW. THAT THAT GETS YOU QUITE DONE IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS RATHER THAN TWO YEARS. AND THEN STATE WATER BOARD INTEGRATED. THEIR STATEWIDE. ARE PERMITS ALSO INTO IT. AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATIONS. INTO THE CAL BTP AS WELL SO PROJECT APPLICANTS WHO ARE STARTING A- LARGER COMPLICATED- WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECT. NOW HAVE A SINGLE APPLICATION TO GO TO. THAT WILL HELP THEM AND TRACK ALL OF THEIR- ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION NEEDS AND PERMITTING NEEDS. IN IN ONE SPOT- AND SO THE CAL BGP IT'S THE FIRST YOU KNOW THREE FOR ONE PERMIT IN ESSENCE- THAT WE'VE SEEN SO IT'S A FULLY SYNCHRONIZED- PERMIT WHICH IS VERY EXCITING. AND WAS A HUGE EFFORT BY THE STATE WATER BOARDS AND A REAL PARADIGM SHIFT- AND HOW WE'RE DOING ENVIRONMENTAL OVERSIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE CAL BTP IS NOT DESIGNED TO REPLACE. SOME OF THE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS THAT PROJECT PROPONENTS ARE USING SO WE HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR VERY SIMPLE. STRAIGHTFORWARD SOMETIMES SINGLE MEDITATION TYPE SMALLER- EIGHT CREDIT SHE TYPE OF FUEL BREAKING FEWER ACTION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. SO PROJECT PROPONENTS CAN STILL EXECUTE AND USE. THOSE EXISTING- EXEMPTIONS. CAL THE GPS HERE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE. MUCH MORE COMPLICATED- AND- AND LARGER PROJECTS SO FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WATER AGENCY. SUCCESSFULLY DEAD. I IT KEEPS IT SUCCEEDED ON A CAL BTP PROJECT. WHERE THEY HAVE A FOUR THOUSAND ACRES AND MULTIPLE VEGETATION TYPES. YEAH AND- AND A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED- PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM TWO YEARS. BUT INSTEAD THEY HAD THAT COMPLETED WITHIN TWO MONTHS. AND SO WE HAVE NOW TO DATE HAD. TWENTY CAL BTP PROJECT. SPECIFIC ANALYSIS SO THAT APPLE ATION- IN AN APPROVED AND STYLE WHICH MEANS GREEN LIGHT TO START THEIR- AND I. THERE'S ANOTHER FISH JUST- THE RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT NUMBER INCREASE BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAN MAY. YEMEN OF FUNDING HAS GONE ON THE GROUND AND OUT THE FROM YEAR WHAT INVESTED INTO SHE- READY FOR. SO THOSE PROJECTS THAT ALREADY HAD EMPIRE PERMITTING JOHN AND SO NOW THAT THE BTP OUR FUNDING IN SEPTEMBER GAVE US A CONTRACT- TO BE ABLE TO. DO PROJECT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS FOR POTENTIALLY THIRTY TO FORTY PROJECTS ON THE GROUND SO THAT LOCAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS NGOS HEALTHCARE UNITS DON'T HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH THE BILL HAVE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS DONE IN THEIR REGION AND COMPLETED. ON A REAL PROJECT FOR THEM ALREADY SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE THIS TOOL- AVAILABLE AND- AND ARE EXCITED TO SEE PEOPLE ALREADY STARTING TO USE THAT AND IT'S. SAVING THEM LOTS OF TIME AND ENERGY. SO- DO YOU HAVE IS THERE A INTERNAL METRIC MEAN. ERA OF A GOAL AND TWENTY TWO IN TERMS OF HOW MANY- PROJECTS YOU WANT TO OCCUR- APPROVED YOU SAID THAT TWENTY HAS BEEN APPROVED FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ON THE PIPELINE. YOU'D MENTION THIRTY TO FORTY BUT IS THAT THE GOAL. TO HAVE THIRTY TO FORTY PROJECTS. APPROVED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I WANT TO JUST BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE SORT OF CREATE WE ARE MAKING THIS TOOL AVAILABLE AND EASY TO USE FOR OUR PROJECT PROPONENTS WHO NEED IT- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. CLOSE THAT CAN USE EMERGENCY EXEMPTIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST- OF THOSE WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO GET AS MANY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS- ASK GAIL ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND FOR THOSE THAT THAT ETP APPLIES FOR WE WANT THEM TO USE THAT AND- IT'S GOING TO EXPEDITE THEIR PROCESS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO. A AS A WHOLE SORT OF LONG TERM CHIU YOUR SEATS FOR PROCESS AND MY LAST QUESTION I IS WHEN A DOLLARS A SHARE FOR HOLDING THAT ARE- OVERSIGHT HEARING- LAST IT LAST YEAR IN DECEMBER- IN THAT HEARING- IT WAS MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO PROVIDE- THE REPORTS FROM AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. THAT'S REQUIRED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE SAID THAT IT WAS GOING TO COME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR DO YOU HAVE A AN UPDATE AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE. WOULD RECEIVE THOSE REPORTS. I BELIEVE WE RECEIVE THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE THAT THOSE ARE IN THE STAGE OF THE CLEARANCE PROCESS AND SHOULD BE T. VERY SHORTLY. VERY SHORTLY AS IN A WEEK A VERY SHORTLY AS IN A YEAR. WELL YESTERDAY BUT- BUT YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD SEE THEM WITHIN THE COMING WEEKS WITHIN THE COMING WEEK ARAMBULA THAT THANK YOU. AND I WILL AS AS AS WELL LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SOUNDS LIKE A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH YEARS AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THIS. BECAUSE OTHERWISE I HAVE MR BANNON IN THE IN THE QUEUE. OKAY SO I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON- THE- DELIVERY OF REPORTS AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT THIS ONE THAT SHOULD BE. IN OUR HANDS WITHIN A WEEK THAT'S- THAT IS GREAT TO HEAR- BUT WE HEARD WITH RESPECT TO A COUPLE OF OTHER REPORTS THAT- BUDGET HEARING RECENTLY. THAT THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED AND THESE ARE REPORTS THAT ARE STATUTORILY MANDATED- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THESE REPORTS BUT- CAN ONE OF YOU. CONFIRM THAT WE WILL RECEIVE THE S. B. FOUR FIFTY SIX REPORT IN APRIL- WITHIN THE TIME FRAME. THAT IS STATUTORILY REQUIRED. YEAH CHAIR- WAIT CRAWFORD HERE SECTOR IT IT'S OF CONCERN TO ME PERSONALLY IF WE'RE MISSING OUR DEADLINES TO GET YOU THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT YOU NEED SO WHAT WE'LL DO AND TONIGHT I WANNA GET OUT OF THE SPECIFICS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF. OF THAT REPORT- BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS WHICH IS WILL FOLLOW UP INTERNALLY AND WILL PREPARE FOR YOU AN UPDATE ON EACH OF THOSE REPORTS AND GIVE YOU A CLEAR SENSE OF WHEN YOU'LL HAVE THEM AND THEN IF THAT'S INFORMATION YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO DO AND DEFINITELY WANTED KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG SPECIFIC QUESTION AS WELL. THANK YOU I'M PHILIP PROCEED NOW WITH THE- MISTER BENNETT'S QUESTIONS AND THEN- MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOULD CHAIR BLOOM- THIS IS THE OVERVIEW QUESTION FOR SECRETARY- CROWFOOT UP. WE ARE SPENDING SUBSTANTIALLY OF. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND NEW MONEY- ON MANY NEW PROGRAMS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND REGIONAL NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND WE WANT TO USE BEST SCIENCE. IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A- AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY- TO CALIFORNIANS TO TRY TO DEVELOP THAT. BEST SCIENCE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO BE LEADERS IN WHAT IS THE BEST SCIENCE FOR THIS WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT IN THESE THESE DIVERSE PLACES THAT- THAT WE HAVE- BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY FOR US TO ENJOY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT WAYS FOR US TO ENSURE. A WE ARE SPENDING THESE DOLLARS- AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO I HAVE A CONCERN THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW MONEY GOING OUT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A DESIRE TO TRY TO MEET REGIONAL NEEDS THAT. THE REGIONAL NEED MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED THAT MAY NOT MATCH UP WITH THE BEST SCIENCE- AND SO IS THERE A WAY FOR US ON A DO WE ARE WE CURRENTLY. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH EACH OF OUR PROJECTS WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT THE BEST SCIENCES THAT WE ARE APPLYING BEST SCIENCE. SO THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN REGIONAL AREAS IDENTIFYING THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY FIT INTO AN OVERALL PLAN THAT SAYS THAT'S THE BEST SCIENCE THE BEST APPLICATION- SO FOR EXAMPLE- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN TALKING ABOUT WE- WE- VEGETATE WITH PLANTS THAT WILL BE BETTER FOR. FOR ALL OF US IN THE LONG RUN INCLUDING FIGHTING FIRES COULD COULD USE HELP ME WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THAT HE I KNOW YOU HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES- AND TRYING TO MOVE ALL OF THIS I JUST WANT TO TRY TO. SEE WHAT KIND OF SINCE WE HAVE IN TERMS OF PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT ONE- RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALLOWS FOR JESSICA TO JUMP IN AS WELL SO ON THIS TASK FORCE WHICH IS REALLY DRIVING OUR PROGRESS WE HAVE A SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT'S COMPRISED OF SCIENTISTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE IN THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS- FEDERAL LABS AT SENTARA. AND THEIR THEIR PURPOSE ON THIS TASK FORCE IS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT. THE PLANS WERE PUTTING IN PLACE AND ULTIMATELY THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS GROUNDED IN THAT BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE SO I'D SAY THAT'S- THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING THERE. I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE INCLUDING THE COMPOSITION OF THE SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IS ALL AVAILABLE ONLINE AND ONE WOULD JUST HAVE TO GO GOAL- GOVERNOR'S. WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE TASK FORCE. AND YOU'LL SEE ACTUALLY A REAL TIME UPDATE ON THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WE'RE TAKING. I THOUGHT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS WERE REALLY EXCITED ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET. THAT WE'RE PROPOSING INVESTMENTS IN CLIMATE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE RESEARCH. TO THE UC'S AND CSU SYSTEM FOR MORE OF THAT INDEPENDENT RESEARCH THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE- WHAT WE'RE DOING ON ON WILDFIRE SCIENCE. AND THEN I'LL ALSO SAY. YOU KNOW THE POINT THAT YOU ALL HAVE STRESSED AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LEADERS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE. WITH THE CHAPARRAL ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. CONSERVING THE CHAPARRAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEN RE FOREST ING THOSE LANDSCAPES TO THAT BACK TO THE CHAPARRAL ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NOW INTERNALIZED AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE SORT OF DEPARTED FROM A TOP DOWN APPROACH ON PLANNING AND REALLY FOCUSED ON MORE OF A BOTTOM UP WITH REGIONAL. STRATEGIES AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT REGIONAL EFFORTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO THE SCIENCE. SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THAT TASK FORCE. SO THAT'S SOME OF THE CONNECTIVITY AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A WORK. IN PROGRESS JESSICA. ABSOLUTELY IS HIGHER INVESTMENT IS REALLY ANGERED IN SCIENCE- WE WERE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN HELPING US SECURE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REMOTE SENSING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FIVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- OR I'VE GROUND SCIENCE AS WELL AND SO THAT COMBINATION OF INVESTING IN. RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS- AND I FY A PLEASURE FORCED INVENTORY ANALYSIS PLUS WHICH ALLOWS THE STUDY SEGMENTS OF FORCED OVERTIME ON THE GROUND IN ADDITION SHE REMOTE SENSING WHICH GIVES US I INVESTMENT SUCH AS LIDAR WHICH WE'RE LEVERAGING. THOSE WINDS AT USGS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO AWARD US FUNDING FOR A LIGHTER ACROSS NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE CRITICAL WATERSHEDS- INCLUDING THE NORTH COAST AND MUCH OF THIS YEAR- WHICH IS GOING TO HELP US GET THAT REAL TIME ASSESSMENT. ONLINE POST FIRE WATERSHED RECOVERY FOR EXAMPLE- STORE REALLY GROUNDING IN THIS AND SCIENCE AND THEN IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT MOST OF THE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE- STATE PARKS IS A GREAT MODEL. OF DOING REAL TIME ANALYTICS- AS THEY ARE ROLLING OUT NEW MODELS FOR RESILIENCY I'M STILL EVEN OUR PROGRAM DOLLARS ARE INVESTING IN THAT SCIENCE. AS WELL AS THESE DIRECT LINES I'M A FOR. DATA ANALYTICS AND REMOTE SENSING TO HELP US IMPROVE OUR MODELS AND OUR FEEDBACK LOOPS. THAT WE ARE PLANNING WITH THE BEST SCIENCE AND- JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE EXAMPLES OF THAT SO. FOR EXAMPLE- CALIFORNIA PARTNERED WITH- IT WITH SEVERAL OF THE UC'S TO DESIGN- ALL POLL PROGRAM THAT IS A LONG TERM- PROJECT WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING AT. HOW SEEDLINGS FARE- FROM LOWER ELEVATIONS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND FROM HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO LOWER ELEVATIONS OF TAKING- DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIKE GIANT. WHITE AND NATIVE PLANTS AND PULLING THEM INTO YOUR- DIFFERENT ECO ZONES AND CLIMATE ZONES WHERE THOSE PLANS ARE STILL NATIVE. AND TESTING OUTSIDE CLIMATE. RESILIENCE REFOREST RIGHT. TRYING TO PLAY FOR HIGHER- GOING TO SURVIVE BETTER AT LOWER- AND HARD. IN THE ERA WHICH SO THERE'S A LOT OF REACH HOW ON THE ROUND NOW GETTING BACK THE LOOP. THE OTHER THING WE'RE DOING IS IN IS THAT'S NEW IN THIS. WE TEN MILLION DOLLAR LAST YEAR OF OUR ONE AND ARE NOW ASKING FOR IT IS A STATE. AND INTO THE STATE. FOR A SYSTEM THIS IS WHERE WE BACK. TO BE A TO DO. LONG TERM ALONG- EXPERIMENTS AND HAVE- HAD TELL US ABOUT FOREST HYDROLOGY I RESTORATION ECOLOGY AND HOW OUR TREATMENTS ON THE GROUND FOR A PRESCRIBED FIRE TWO MASTICATION. ARE IMPACTING LONG TERM FOREST HEALTH AND CARBON STORAGE STILL ALLOWS US TO HAVE THOSE CONSISTENT. NUMBER HAVE BEEN IN THE STATE OWNERSHIP FOR SOME OF THEM SEVENTY YEARS THAT ARE ALLOWING US TO SEE CHANGE OVER TIME. AND AND GET REALLY SOLID EUROPEAN SCIENCE- THAT IS INFORMING OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE. JUST VERY BRIEFLY IF I COULD FOLLOW UP I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS AND I APPRECIATE THE SINCERE COMMITMENT I'M THE GENUINE COMMITMENT I'M HEARING- TO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS- GOOD SCIENCE- ONE JUST QUICK QUESTION IS THERE- ACT I CERTAINLY WE ARE. INVESTING IN RESEARCH EXTENT OR IS THERE SOME KIND OF SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW OF EACH PROJECT AS IT GOES OUT TO JUST MAKE SURE IT DOES MEET- CURRENT SCIENCES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACTIVELY DO OR DO WE SIMPLY TO APPLY GOOD SCIENCE AS IT SORT OF. THE FALLS AND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT IS BUT IS THERE ANY KIND OF SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE INVESTING IN BEEN IN PROJECTS THAT DO MEET- SORT OF SOME KIND OF SCIENTIFIC STANDARD AND THAT ALSO WE CAN ALL START TO. CONFIRM FOR MANY PEOPLE. AS AS AS WE LOOK AT THIS. OR NOT WE DON'T DON'T SEE TO. A UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE THE BEST SCIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO- FIRE FOR. BOTH WILDFIRE. AND WILD FOR. MITIGATION MEASURES LIKE CENTER SO IT JUST IT DOES NEED TO BE A LONG ANSWER BUT JUST OVERALL IS THAT IS THAT THEIR EX OR SOME KIND OF REVIEW THAT TAKES PLACE. ON ANY KIND OF OFFICIAL BASIS OR IS IT MORE IT IS A SCIENCE IS APPLIED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY ADOPTED. IS REALLY ONE OF OUR CORE MANTRAS IN TERMS OF AND IS INTEGRATED INTO ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. I'M SO THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE STANDARDS THAT WERE FORCING BOTH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT GOES INTO EACH OF THESE PROJECTS- AS WELL AS THE GRANT GUIDELINES THAT GO OUT- RECORDS PROJECTS. IN INCLUDES THE LATEST- MANAGEMENT MODELING AND INTEGRATES THE LATEST SCIENCE- INTO OUR STANDARDS- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE JUST AS PART OF OUR- OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROGRAMS- WE HAVE MONITORING THAT GOES BACK. AND ENSURES THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE THE PROJECT PROPONENTS. DID THE WORK CORRECTLY. THANK YOU VERY. ASSEMBLY SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR FOR FOLLOWING UP AND WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING OF THE WHOLE PRESENTATION COME FORWARD THEN WE CAN ASK QUESTIONS. BUT A JUST COUPLE IMPROBABLY FOR US SECRETARY CROWFOOT. HOW MUCH OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT OUT OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT. OR JUST I'M ON A LIMB HERE SO I'LL I'LL I MAY TURN A JET JESSICA I THINK I THINK WE'RE STILL WORKING ON FRANKLY GETTING THAT THAT PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING BUT- OVER YOU JUST GOT. ABSOLUTELY THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS A REALLY- NEW AND NOVEL CONCEPT WHERE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WORKING SPECIFICALLY WITH TRYING. TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT REMOVES A LOT OF THE BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS AND HURDLES FOR TRIED ACCESSING DOLLARS. SO CRIMES HAVE BEEN VERY INTEGRATED- IN ACCESSING PROJECT DOLLARS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE- THE ENTIRE PROGRAM FROM SORT OF PARTNERSHIPS ON STATE PARKS. AND- FORCED HEALTH GRANT DOLLARS TO THE OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUING TO FIND. PROJECT TYPE ONE MEANS- ON TRIBAL LAND AND TRIBAL PARTNERSHIPS. THIS TRIBAL GRANT PROGRAM IS TRYING TO CREATE A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW WE ENGAGE WITH TRIBES AND SO. OUR NEW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TRAVEL- FORMATION I ASKED THE RESOURCES AGENCY IS DEVELOPING IT IN CONSULTATIONS. WITH TRIBES BUT OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS A TRIBALLY LED. AND TRIBALLY DESIGN PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IT DOESN'T GET TO MOVE AT THE SAME SPEED. OF JUST GETTING THE PROJECT HOURS ON THE GROUND BUT I JUST WANT TO REASSURE YOU. THAT PROJECTS DOLLARS ARE GETTING TWO TRIBES VERY CONSISTENTLY- THROUGHOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THIS PROGRAM WHILE THIS NEW PROJECT- AND PARADIGM SHIFT IS BEING DEVELOPED. JUST TO BE DIRECTLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DON'T THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE EXPANDED- FUNDING FROM THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO TRIBES YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THAT STILL THAT TWENTY MILLION IS SAFE. FOR THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO BE GAVE. AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR FOLLOWING UP FOR THE MASS BECAUSE I THINK THE QUITE WITH A BY MASS TRANSPORTATION A BIO MAY FOR SO. TOOK UP THE SO WE GET TO THE REFORM. OF AND DO IT RIGHT SO I WON'T GO TOO MUCH WITH THAT. AND IN ANOTHER WOULD JUST GO FOLLOWING UP WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG. IS I ASK THAT QUESTION IN DECEMBER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAITING ALL MONTH FOR THAT REPORT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO IT IN THE NEXT WEEK AND I'LL GIVE YOU TO IN CASE- SOMEBODY. MIGHT COME UP WITH THE FLU HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU MISTER- ONE THING THAT'S COME UP PREVIOUSLY AN IDEA AND- YEARS PAST AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED HERE TODAY IS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS FROM THE OF FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM- DO YOU HAVE STATISTICS AVAILABLE- THERE'S STILL A LONG BEEN A CONCERN THAT- MANY OF THOSE FUNDS DON'T MAKE THEIR WAY- INSUFFICIENT AMOUNTS DOWN TO A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS- SO IN THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS- WHAT THE EARLY ACTION FOR THE GRANTS THAT WERE AWARDED- THAT SOUTHERN REGION HAD RECEIVED SIXTY FOUR AWARDS TOTALING SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THE NORTHERN REGION. RECEIVE FORTY AWARDS TOTALING SEVENTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SO IT'S A PRETTY EVEN DISTRIBUTION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I THINK I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS GOING UP BY FOR QUESTIONS ON THE ISSUE ONE- I KNOW WE'VE COVERED SOME OF THE GROUND- FOR ISSUE TWO ALREADY BUT- IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. A SECRETARY AND ALEJO AND OTHERS SAID- TO PRESENT ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHY pCALLING RIGHT- SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AT YOUR PRESENT ON THE FOREST I AM WILDFIRE RESILIENCE TASK FORCE I REQUEST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST A GARBAGE TRUCK CHAIRMAN I'M PATRICK RIGHT I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE US WHILE WILDFIRE FORCE RESILIENCE TASK FORCE THAT SECTOR CROWFOOT- MENTIONED ALL KEEP MY REMARKS SHORT BECAUSE I THINK HE DID A pHE MENTIONED- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR WE RECONFIGURED THE TASK FORCE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY A STATE ONLY TASK FORCE BUT IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WE'VE EXPANDED THE TASK FORCE TO INCLUDE THE REGIONAL FORSTER WHO NOW. CO CHAIRS IT WAS SECRETARY CROWFOOT WE ALSO HAVE LEADERSHIP OF SI SAKET RC RC TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THE COUNTIES FULLY ENGAGED AND WE'VE GOT A TRIBAL A MEMBER FROM THE INTERTRIBAL INDIGENOUS STEWARDSHIP OUR NETWORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING GOOD- TRIBAL INVOLVEMENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF. THE ACTION PLAN AND ALL OUR EFFORTS STATEWIDE SO THAT'S OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THAT LEADS A TASK FORCE AS A WHOLE WE ALSO HAVE ROUGHLY A DOZEN OR MORE DIFFERENT INTER AGENCY AND STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN WORK GROUPS ON EVERYTHING FROM PRESCRIBER TO REFORESTATION TO WOOD UTILIZATION TO MAKE SURE. THE AGENCIES ARE WORKING IN ALIGNMENT LEVERAGING THEIR FUNDS WORKING TOGETHER SCALING UP A REMOVING BARRIERS THAT ARE PREVENTING US FROM MOVING AHEAD IN ALL OF THOSE AREAS- ON IT SECRETARY CRAWFORD SAID WERE ALSO LASER FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON THE NINETY NINE ACTIONS THAT ARE IN THE ACTION PLAN. WE HAVE A SO CALLED AIR TABLE OUR SYSTEM THAT SET UP WHERE YOU CAN GO ON AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE ACTIONS WHICH AGENCIES WILL LEAD WHAT'S THEIR SCHEDULE OR THEY ON TRACK OR THE BEHIND WHAT ARE THEIR COMPLETION DATES ALL OF THIS IS CAPTURED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT'S REQUIRED BY S. B. FOUR FIVE SIX. WE DID COMPLETE THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR IT'S ONLINE AGAIN YOU COULDN'T AS SUCH A GROUP WOULD SAID YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE WILDFIRE TASK FORCE. AND YOU COULD SEE THE WORK PLANS FOR ALL OF THE WORK. ALL THE SKIN. THE CHARTER FOR THE TAP FORCE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE INFORMATION. THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON. ON IT WE THINK IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY SO CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR INPUT ON HOW WELL THAT'S WORKING. WELL WE WILL BE TAKING IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL WITH AN UPGRADED WEBSITE UNDER A NEW COMMUNICATIONS. CONTRACTORS WELL SO THAT WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT AS- AS JESSICA SAID WE'VE GOT DOZENS AND DOZENS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OUT THERE VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM. SO REAL WILL REALLY COMMITTED THE TASK FORCE TO BE A ONE STOP SHOP FOR INFORMATION FOR STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE TO OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE MONEY IS FLOWING WHAT PROGRAMS ARE MOVING FORWARD. WELL IT'S CETERA SO HOPEFULLY ALL THAT- WILL COME TOGETHER. I'LL DISCUSS THEN REALLY THE BUDGET WELL HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS RIGHT NOW. WE'RE VERY LEAN AND MEAN BASICALLY THE TASK FORCE STAFF IS MY SELF. IN A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT CAL FIRE WHOSE OPERATING THROUGH A BORROWED POSITION. OF THE BUDGET SUGGESTS THAT WE RAMP THAT UP A BIT WELL WE'RE PROPOSING TO POSITIONS OF SEE AN ALREADY. TO HELP WITH COMMUNICATIONS AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS. DIVERSITY IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US ALSO TWO POSITIONS AT CAL FIRE ON TO MAKE SURE WE BACK FEEL OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE BARRING RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO HAVE A VARIETY OF CONSULTING CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THINGS LIKE COMMUNICATIONS FOR OUR SCIENCE PROGRAM. AND FOR FACILITATORS. THERE WAS A QUESTION IN THE BUDGET RIGHT UP ABOUT IT WHY DON'T YOU ADDING STATE STAFF TO HANDLE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES WE COULD CERTAINLY GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND HIGHER HALF A DOZEN STAFF. WE THINK IT'S MORE EFFICIENT THOUGH JUST TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH WORK GROUP AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED FROM A FACILITATION PERSPECTIVE. OUR CONTRACTS RANGE FROM ANYWHERE FROM A SMALL FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CNTRACT TO THE R. C. D.'S TO FACILITATE. OUR PRIVATE LANDOWNER WORKGROUP TO I. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CONTRACT WITH THE WATER SHOULD CENTER FOR THE WOOD UTILIZATION WORKGROUP. TO A MULTI YEAR TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT TO SUPPORT OUR SCIENCE ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO WE THINK A MORE. TAILORED APPROACH. MAKES MORE SENSE IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE MORE EFFICIENT BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND- I HEAR HOW WE CAN BETTER CLARIFY HOW THAT'S GOING AND- REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW BEST TO FUND OUR ON GOING OPERATIONS. SO THANK YOU AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN THE FOCUS OF THAT BUDGET REQUEST IS STRICTLY ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE AND HOPEFULLY WITH THESE FUNDS. WILL BE BETTER POSITIONED TO DELIVER BOTH ON. THE ACTION PLAN REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO ON YOU KNOW THE HIGH NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT ALL ASPECTS. OF WHAT WE'RE DOING SO THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU DOES- L. A. O. OR- BERMAN FIND HAVE BEEN. TO ADD ON THIS. I WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU FINANCES THE MOMENT EITHER A TOPIC ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- ALLOW ME TO- ASKED THEN AND I THINK IT'LL BE GREAT IF OUR STAFF TO KIND OF PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN- AND ENTERING INTO NEW CONTRACTS- OR- PERHAPS HANDLING SOME OF THE THESE. CONSULTING. ISSUES- IN IN HOUSE HAVE IS- WHEN WILL THE STATE COMPLETE THE FINE SCALE VEGETATION MAPPING FOR THE ENTIRE STATE- INCLUDING THE SIERRA NEVADA CENTRAL CLOSE TO NORTH COAST. THAT WILL HELP GUIDE FOR PREVENTION ACTIVITIES GOING TO BE WORKING WITH INTERAGENCY TEAM AND STAKEHOLDERS TO AS JESSICA SAID TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FULL SUITE OF INFORMATION NEEDS WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM LIDAR TO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT THE VEGETATION MAPPING. ALSO WILL CERTAINLY BE BACK TO YOU SOON WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION- BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY MINDFUL OF THE NEED TO HAVE THE BEST A SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GET TO HELP GUIDE THESE PROJECTS. THANK YOU ARE CERTAINLY AGREE- WITH RESPECT TO THOSE CONTRACTS WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT- WHY ARE SOME OF THEM ONGOING IT SOUNDS LIKE MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE- NATURE OF- SHORT TERM. WELL IT'S A MIX I MEAN I THINK IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE WORK GROUPS ARE WORKING TOWARDS TRYING TO GET CONSOLIDATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS DONE AND THEN THOSE WORK GROUPS WILL PHASE OUT OTHERS LIKE THE PRESCRIBED FIRE WORKGROUP- THEY WANT TO REMAIN IN PLACE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. AND COORDINATE THE EFFORTS THAT STATE FEDERAL LOCAL AND COMMUNITY PRESCRIBED FIRE VETS SO THEY EXPECT TO HAVE AN ONGOING WORK PLAN FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YARS- SO OVERALL IT'S A IT'S A MIX OF. OF SHORTER TERM IN LONGER TERM EFFORTS. GREAT- THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- REGARDING ISSUE NUMBER THREE. I SHOULD ASK ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE TOO OKAY. SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE ARE THERE- IS THERE ADDITIONAL- TESTIMONY REGARDING THAT ISSUE. MORE IN THE FUTURE WE COULD CERTAINLY PRESENT ON EACH OF THOSE AB I GUESS EQUIPMENT RIGHT CLARIFYING QUESTION FOR YOU IS THERE'S CONSOB. GROUPS WITHIN THAT FOR SURGE CAPACITY MODERATES AND THEN CARRY THE L. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THEM ALL AT ONCE OR DO YOU PREFER TO TAKE THE MARKET TIME. I THINK YOU COULD TAKE THEM ALL AT ONCE. OKAY IF I COULD TURN TO- CHIEF JOE TYLER WITH CAL FIRE TO TALK ABOUT THE SURGE CAPACITY- ISSUES. I THINK YOU GET THE BEST POSITION TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THOSE. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO. TALK TO YOU HERE TODAY- SO AS- YOU SEEN IN THOSE ISSUES- WE HAVE- MURDERS THE SURGE CAPACITY ENHANCEMENTS- THAT EMERGENCY SURGE CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT- IS A REQUEST FOR A SEVENTY NINE POINT. EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. TO INCREASE SEARCH FOR CAPACITY FOR A WHILE AND- MERGES THE RESPONSE BY ADDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT CAN BE USED DURING CRITICAL FIRE CONDITIONS AND RESOURCE DRAWDOWN. LET ME START BY ASKING SECRETARY CREW PUT LARGELY SET THE STAGE- AND DID EXTREMELY WELL OF WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE IN EACH ONE OF THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW WHERE THE CONDITIONS WITH IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. AND NOT ONLY RELATED TO- SURGE CAPACITY BUT WE KNOW THEM THE WOMEN AND MEN ON THE GROUND- FIGHTING THESE FIRES- ACROSS. THE STATE FEDERAL LOCAL AND TRIBAL AGENCIES AS WELL AS OUR- AS WELL AS OUR OUR PRIVATE VENDORS HAVE REALLY BEEN DOING- HECK OF A JOB ACROSS THE YEARS- TRYING TO COMBAT THESE LARGE AND DAMAGING AND DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. SO WE TAKE IT INTO PIECES I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEARCH CAPACITY RIGHT NOW. BUT TO THE POINT OF- THAT IT THAT IT TAKES IN ALL APPROACH EFFORT NOT ONLY FROM THE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALREADY. BUT MAKING SURE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS ADDING RESOURCES ON THE GROUND- THAT CAN MITIGATE INITIAL ATTACK WILDFIRES TO TRY TO KEEP THEM SMALL SO. WE CAN GET OUR. WOMEN AND MEN BACK- TO REST THE NEXT. TO FIRE WE'RE ALSO. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION A GENERAL FUND. WE'RE REQUESTING NINETY NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TO ADD UP FOR ADDITIONAL S. SEVENTY I. FIREHAWK HELICOPTERS. TO PROVIDE AIRCRAFT AVAILABILITY FOR THE- TWELVE- S. SEVENTY I. FIREHAWK HELICOPTERS THAT YOU ALL HAVE APPROVED- PREVIOUSLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS OUT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS AVAILABILITY OF- FIREHAWK HELICOPTERS- SO THAT WHEN ONE GOES DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE COVERAGE. OF THOSE HELICOPTERS IN ADDITION TO THAT- THE INTENT OF THE S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTER PROGRAM HERE WOULD BE TO SEARCH THOSE AIRCRAFT- DURING HEIGHTENED FIRE CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHICH WE COULD STAFF WITH ADDITIONAL CREWS TO STOPPING PATTERNS AND ADDITIONAL PILOTS THAT WE HAVE ON HAND- TO BE ABLE TO FLY THESE AIRCRAFT AND- FIGHT TO NATIONAL ATTACK WILDFIRES. SECOND PART OF THIS HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND PACKAGES- REQUESTING FORTY FIVE MILLION THE GENERAL FUND FOR- ANNUALLY FOR THREE YEARS- TO SECURE- TEN ADDITIONAL. EXCLUSIVE USE HEAVY HELICOPTERS- TO ASSIST IN COMBATING HIS INITIAL ATTACK WILDFIRES THIS IS UP. PARTLY FOR AN INITIAL ATTACK FIRE FIGHTING IN REALLY COMBATING THIS FIRES ABOUT THE SAME TIME ADDING SURGE CAPACITY WHILE WE'RE WAITING- THE FEDERAL C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS TO BE RETROFITTED BY THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE. AND BE DELIVERED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE TRANSFER TITLE TRANSFER OF TITLE- AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WE- ARE ANTICIPATED THOSE AIRCRAFT COMING IN IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW AS IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW- WE ARE APPEARING AT A PROBABLY BE LATE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. AND SOME OF THOSE AIRCRAFT INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR BEFORE- THOSE AIRCRAFT ACTUALLY ARRIVE SO I BELIEVE THAT THE TEN ADDITIONAL HEAVY HELICOPTERS. IN ADDITION TO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR- TO ADD EXCLUSIVE USE AIRCRAFT WILL REALLY PROVIDE. A GREAT INVESTMENT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TO COMBAT THOSE INITIAL ATTACK FIRES- IN IN COMPLEMENT THE- KALIFORNIA- AIRCRAFT FLEET. LASTLY FOR- EMERGENCIES ABOUT THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION- TO ADD- TWO ADDITIONAL SEARCH ENGINES IN EACH OF OUR TWENTY ONE OPERATIONAL UNITS ACROSS. THE STATE AS WELL AS- TO ADDITIONAL PER CONTRACT COUNTY FOR THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES. IN ADDITION TO THAT TEN ADDITIONAL SURGE CAPACITY BULLDOZERS WHICH IS THE- TRANSPORT TO- BUT THOSE ARE TRANSPORT THE CLOSER AND THE BOULDERS ARE SERVICE UNIT. AND WHICH THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL OF THAT EQUIPMENT- WE BELIEVE. THAT THE ADDITION OF TWO ADDITIONAL SEARCH ENGINES FOR RESERVE STATUS AND BE ABLE TO SEARCH DURING CRITICAL CONDITIONS. ALLOW US- BASED ON THE STAFFING THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN EACH ONE OF THOSE OPERATIONAL UNITS ARE REASONABLE- NO REGRETS ASK OF ADDING THE SEARCH ENGINES TO- TO THOSE UNITS FOR. THE PURPOSE OF ADDING ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL. ON OF THIS APPARATUS DURING CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER. THANK YOU CHIEF TYLER WE'RE GONNA ASK HELLO YES IF THEY'LL DO A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FIR INTEGRATED REAL TIME INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS OR VIRUS SO I THINK AND THEY'RE TOGETHER OVER AND CALLAWAY ESTA. COURSE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE CARILLO YES AVAILABLE. SWITCHER LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME AUDIO ISSUES. CHEER OF ANOTHER UP PRESENTATION YOU WANT TO MOVE TO OTHER FIGURING THAT OUT. I'M SURE CHIEF TYLER DO NOT TOUCH ON CADDY THE L. IN THE INTERVENING MOMENTS. YES ABSOLUTELY AGAIN- CHAIR BLOEMEN AND MEMBERS- JOE TYLER AGAIN A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FIRE PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA- SO THE THIRD ITEM IN THIS- SEARCH PROPOSAL IN THIS PROPOSAL IS- THE REFRESH OF OUR CAT ABL SYSTEM OUR COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH IN A AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION PROGRAM A HARDWARE SERVICE AND REFRESH IT'S AN INCREASE OF- TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTING FORTY THREE POSITIONS STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AD THEN SEVENTEEN POINT NINE MILLION THAT COMES- REQUESTED FROM THE STATE A MERCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT SET NOW STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS WELL TO ACQUIRE INSTALL SUPPORT THE COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS AND- AND THEN THE A. B. L. M. B. T. MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT AND THIS IS REALLY- THE CAD PROGRAM IS THE CORE OF CALPERS- DISPATCHING- WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD THIS PROGRAM THROUGH A NORTHROP GRUMMAN NORTHROP GRUMMAN SOLD IT TO A COMPANY CALLED PERATON AND THAT IS THE INTENT OF CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE RELATIONSHIP TO REFRESH THE- A QUICK MET- AND ARMORS TO COMMAND CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE FUNCTIONALITY AND THE QUICKEST-AVAILABLE RESPONSE TO- TO EMERGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION- IT INCLUDES ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR FORTY THREE POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN OUR HEADQUARTERS REGIONS IN UNIT PROGRAMS THAT HELP WITH THE ONGOING OPERATION MAINTENANCE INCREASE TECHNOLOGY DEMANDS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM REALLY. THIS COMES DOWN TO- WHAT. I'M IT- CHAIR BLAME YOU HEARD OF AND THEN- THAT EVERY FOR YEARS WE COME BACK TO REFRESH- THE COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES A FIVE YEAR HARDWARE REFRESH AND ALL THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT AND THE REASON WE DO THIS. IS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE WARRANTIES HAVE EXPIRED ON ALL THE EQUIPMENT- AND WE WANT THE BEST AND MOST UP TO DATE EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO DISPATCH OUR RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION IT'S TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- GENERAL FUND FOR AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION HARDWARE AND INSTALLATION WIRING SERVICES ANOTHER MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS THERE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL THE CAT HARDWARE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY WILL BE OUT OF WARRANTY BY JULY ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE SOME OF IT BEFORE- BASED ON WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED AND INSTALLED. CURRENTLY THE ABL EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE A TWELVE HUNDRED UNITSACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BASED ON WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED AND INSTALLED WILL BE OUT OF SERVICE AN OUT OF WARRANTY BY SEPTEMBER ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ASKING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE- FIVE YEAR REPLACEMENT CYCLE TO MEET THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES BEST PRACTICES FOR HARDWARE REPLACEMENT MAINTENANCE SUPPORT. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES H. P. THAT ALSO DOES A REFRESH OF THEIR AB YELLING CATS SYSTEM TO EVERY FIVE YEARS. WITH THAT I'M STEPHEN I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU APPENDING QUESTIONS. SO LET'S JUST CHECK BACK WITH CARILLO YES AND SEE IF WHILE. WE'RE GOOD. ANY LUCK OVER AT CALLOWAY'S HEADQUARTERS. OKAY WELL I WILL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE RECORD-EAGLE FIRESTONE AND THAT THAT YOU'VE TYLER ALSO IT THIS IS A JOINT PROPOSAL BETWEEN CALLAWAY US IN CALIFORNIA OR SO AND WE'LL DO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HANDLE THIS WELL WE- WE FOR- YES TO BE ABLE TO THANK YOU I KNOW IT'S NOT THE NORM FOR- CAL OH YES TO BE THE AGENCY. HAS A HARD TIME COMMUNICATING. HELLO USUALLY PASSED. SO AWARE TO- SO THE VIRUS PER IS IF I MENTION TO JOIN HER WOULD CAO YEAH CAL- UP IN ITS MAY DOLLARS I'M GOING GENERAL FUND AND THIRTY ONE POSITIONS TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION AND ELEVEN POSITIONS WOULD BE A CALLOW YES THE REMAINING FIVE POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY POSITIONS WOULD BE A CALIFORNIA- REALLY WITH THIS WITH THIS DOES IS IT. TEN YEARS AND- ENHANCES A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS STARTED THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENT IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET. THAT PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR A ORANGE COUNTY FIRE DISTRICT TO START UP A- PROGRAM WITH THIS PROGRAM DOES IS IT DOES. AERIAL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. NEAR REAL TIME INSTANTANEOUS INTELLIGENCE. OVER DIFFERENT DISASTERS KNOWS THE NAME INDICATES ONE OF THE PRIMARY USES OF THIS IS BEEN WILDFIRE. BUT IT ALSO HAS BEEN USED FOR THE OIL SPILL THAT RECENTLY HAPPENED- AND IT CAN BE USED FOR ALL HAZARD- TYPES IN TERMS OF GATHERING INTELLIGENCE TO HELP WITH. STRATEGIC AND- BETTER INFORMED REAL TIME DECISIONS FOR ON THE GROUND AND IN CALIFORNIA'S POSITIONSAND- ORDERLY BE GEARED TOWARDS. THAT ON THE GROUND REAL TIME DECISION MAKING USING OF THAT INTELLIGENCE AND THE CALLOW YES RESOURCES WILL REALLY HELP WITH THE- IMPROVE OUR WITH WITHIN INFORMING. HAVE DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR- OF OUR OUR HIGHEST LEVEL STILL OF THE STATE'S BUDGET MAKERS. WHAT THE WITH THIS PROPOSAL DOES THE IN TERMS OF ENHANCING ON WHAT ORANGE COUNTY HAS ALREADY DONE IS THE UNDER THE ORANGE COUNTY PROGRAM. WE HAVE ACCESS TO ONE AIRCRAFT IN A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BASIS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS A RECALL THERE'S A IT'S A BASICALLY A TWELVE HOUR A DAY AVAILABILITY AND SO THIS. ENHANCEMENT WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AIRCRAFT AVAILABILITY BOTH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN GET AN AIR ASSETS TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE. ARE RAPIDLY REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE HAVE DISASTERS- IN THE STATE. AND ALSO REALLY ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES IN TERMS OF WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE DISASTERS GOING ON WHICH HAS BEEN A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN THE STATE HAS CERTAINLY IN RECENT YEARS. SO I WILL LEAVE IT WITH THAT AN INCH CHIEF TYLERTON'S ANYTHING YOU I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A WELCOME TO DO THAT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT STEPHEN- I GUESS I WOULD ASK FOR STEVEN DID- YES MAKE IT ONLINE. AND IF NOT I WILL- TRY TO SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF- I THINK THAT- WE HAVE SHARED- THE- POINTS TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. YOUR FRIEND WELL STEVEN AND BLUE IN MEMBERS AGAIN I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY- THE FIRES PROPOSAL IS AN EXCITING ADVENTURE BEING ABLE TO MOVE- THIS PROPOSAL FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT- ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY- PROGRAM INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IN JOINT BETWEEN CALLOW YES AND- AND CAL FIRE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY- TO INSURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL HAZARD INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS- OUR WILDFIRE PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL- THE PROPOSAL IS AND YOU SAID STEPHEN REALLY INCLUDES FUNDING FOR TO FULLY CAPABLE AIRCRAFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR PILOTS AND AIRCREW MAINTENANCE- SUPPORT OF A- FUSION CENTER ACROSS THE STATE ADDITIONAL MODELERS FUNDS A SUPPORT- TECHNOLOGICAL UPDATES- AND ENSURING THAT THERE'S CONTRACTUAL SUPPORT- THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS- MANAGED. THROUGH CALORIE S. AND THEN IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN- CALLAWAY US IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL HAVE AN ABILITY THROUGH AN OPERATING PLAN TO OPERATE THIS AIRCRAFT ON ALL HAS EMERGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE CALIFORNIA. A PAUSE THERE. A PENDING ANY QUESTIONS EVEN. I THINK ALL WE HAVE MISTER CHAIRED IN TERMS OF PRESENTATION ON THESE ITEMS SO- WILL CONNECT SEEM TO L. A- FOR ANY. THINGS- TREAT YOUR PLEASURE. THANK YOU ADD CHAIR IF I IF I MAY- IS OKAY IF I PROCEED THANK YOU MIKE YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR- I GET THE OPPORTUNITY THAT TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM I'M SO WE RECENTLY RELEASED THE SECOND REPORT I KNOW WE REFERENCE THAT ONE ON WELFARE RESILIENCY ALSO RECENTLY USED ONE. THAT COVERS THE MAJOR WILDFIRE RESPONSE RELATED PROPOSALS I'M SO THAT IT'S ALSO AGAIN ON OUR WEBSITE I MISS EMORY SOME OF THE OVER ARCHING I AM PLEASED THAT WE BRING UP IN THAT- IN THAT REPORT. AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT THREE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY AS PART OF THIS- THIS HEARING SO OVERALL WE FIND THAT SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL WHAT THAT RESPONSE CAPACITY AND HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AGAIN YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THAT REALLY- SEVERE WILDFIRES THE STATE HAS HAD- AND THOSE HAVE STRANGE CAPACITY- UNDER RESPONSE SIDE- SO WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO DO SOME OCCUPATIONS IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER WE DO FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL'S WOULD RESULT IN A VERY LARGE INCREASING HELP BUYERS BASED SUPPORT BUDGET ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT- AT AT INCREASE IN ITS BASS RESPONSE- BUDGET FACE UP OUR PRODUCTION BUDGET SO THAT'S REALLY QUITE SUBSTANTIAL AND IN TOTAL WILL BE OUT OF ALL THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE CAP OUTLINES. ON YEAH THAT CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS NINE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEARAND QUITE A BIT OF ONGOING FINDING MOST OF ITS ONGOING SO REALLY IT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED. DEDICATED TO INCREASING- SORT OF RESPONSE RESOURCES. I SO AND EXCEPT FOR ISN'T HAPPENED PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL AND- THAT- HAVE BEEN MADE TO. FIRE AND I'M- BY DIFFICULT. FEW YEARS AS WELL. OKAY I'M I'M ANOTHER KEY POINT IS THAT IT'S AN- TO. AT THIS TIME EXTENT TO WHICH TO MAKE PROPOSALS WILL ENHANCE CAPACITY WHICH IS A REALLY CRITICAL PLEDGES IS GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH AS CONSIDERS ALL THESE PROPOSALS STATE WE CAN TAKE. ADVANTAGE FROM DEVELOPMENT A STRATEGIC WILDFIRE. PLAN WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPL OF YEARS. WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION WE STILL THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE WOULD NOW WE TALK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THIS HEARING ABOUT REPORTS THAT. THAT HAVE MEANT THAT THE INVESTORS AND HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO COMPLETE YET YOU OTHER DEMANDS. I'M SO THIS IS ANOTHER AREA OF THE LEGISLATURE ASKED FOR RECORDS PRINCIPLE MIDDLE REPORT. WHICH IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DO YOU- APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THAT REPORT AND IS STILL PENDING WE THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL REPORTS TO HELP. INFORM THE LEGISLATURE DECISIONS BECAUSE THAT REPORT ASKED FOR INFORMATION ON WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES THAT CAL FIRE AND- YES HAVE. WHAT ARE THE GAS WHAT ARE THE GOALS ONE OF THE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES. WE CONTINUE TO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND SO NOW DESPITE THAT SETBACK THE- LACK OF THAT KIND OF PLAN WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT FUNDING. ABOUT DEALING WITH THE RESPONSE NEEDS THAT THE STATE HAS- AND SO WE DID PROVIDE WE DO PROVIDE. AND IF THAT'S- HELLO. I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THOSE. THOSE THREE THAT WE'RE ABOUT TWO. WE WERE TO THE EMERGENCY SURGE COMPACT PROPOSAL YOU HEARD ABOUT. THE ONE THAT WE FOUND. YOU TO HELP. BAD I'M RESERVE AND ACTION ON THIS GROUP. AT THIS TIME THE REASON FOR THE- IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE. AND THREE RESTORE. THAT ARE- THAT ARE BACK REALLY IT'S PART OF AN FOR HUNDRED. DOLLARS IT SATISFIED THE BUDGET THERE NO B. THEO P. YEAH. I'M THAT WOULD BE FOR THE HEALTH AND- OF. I'M A FIRE- WHO ARE ON THE LOOK AND SO THE IDEA AS I AM IT AS IS WITH- WITH THE FIRE JUST. TO DEVELOP THE- OF WHAT THE PROPOSAL LOOKS LIKE MIGHT SEE IN. I'M SORRY YOUR SEATS IS THAT THE STATE FOR THE HEALTH OF. COMPONENT AND THE PURPOSE. IS- INVISION TO BE PROVIDED AS PART OF THAT FOR HIM BILLION SO I'M THAT THERE'S A LOT. BETWEEN THAT MANY AND THIS PROPOSAL SO WE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM- TOGETHER AND TO SEND YOUR GRIEF. BECAUSE OF THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE CAN KIND OF PROPOSAL THAT- IT'S A LITTLE BIT- EXTRA. VALUE RATE WITHOUT THIS KIND OF STRATEGIC PLANNING PART OF IT'S JUST BECAUSE THIS IS EITHER SOME OF THEM I'M PRETTY TECHNICAL THINGS ABOUT WELL HOW HOW DO WE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HELICOPTERS VERSUS HOW MANY ENGINES HAVING ENGINE SHOULD BE- YES ENGINES. YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAINTAIN A FLEET OF ENGINES WE TRIED SYSTEM VERSUS CAL FIRE ENGINES THOSE TYPES OF THINGS- SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME OPTIONS THE CURRENT- ULTIMATELY ONCE IT YOU KNOW I THINK RECEIVE THAT THAT THE OTHER PROPOSAL IS KIND OF DECIDING WHAT TO DO. COULD APPROVE EVERYTHING AS- AS REQUESTED OR COULD TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH- FOR EXAMPLE ONE THING THAT WE MENTIONED AS AN ALTERNATIVE IS- YOU COULD PROVIDE SOMEBODY RESOURCES THIS YEAR DELAY PROVIDING SOME OF THEM AND TO A FUTURE YEAR AND SO YOU GET THAT- THAT IT'S EXPECTED THE ADMINISTRATION. TO HELP GUIDE DECISION MAKING YOU COULD POTENTIALLY DO IN A WAY THAT WOULD NECESSARILY HOLD UP THE RECEIPT OF THOSE SO ONE THING TO MENTION IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FEW YEARS TO GET THE HELICOPTERS ANYWAYS OR YOUR STANDING IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR EVERY. HELICOPTER YOU ORDER IT TAKES NEXT THREE YEARS IF YOU ORDER TO YOU IT TAKES YEARS OF YOUR REPORT THANKS FOR YEARS- ABOUT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T CONSIDER WELL YOU CAN PROVE TO YOU AND YOU CAN MEET AND- THE END YOU CAN STILL WAIT ON THE OTHER TO YOU UNTIL YOU HAVE THAT. THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO THAT'S ONE OPTION THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL ON EMERGENCY SEARCH CAPACITY. I'M SO ON- I. GET THE TICKET IN ORDER WE WENT AND THE- INTO. ON EIGHT K. ABA. WE'RE GOING TO THAT THE PROGRAM. ON THE BENEFITS EXTENDING AB I. EVERY CAL. CRAP I RESOURCE IT JUST AS- I THINK IT'S VERY. IN THE- COMMENTS MADE BY THE- RIGHT NOW. AB L. THAT. VEHICLE LOW. IS ON ABOUT. HUNDRED REACHED. ARE CARTON. TO GEN CARS. THAT THE HAS AND THOSE ARE. THE FOR LINE ONE THERE KNOW CARS AND- ENGINES YEAH. VEHICLES JUST THE CARS. I'M THE IDEA IS THAT THIS WAY AND THEN. PROPOSAL EXPAND. L. TO ALL OF THE OF THE VIA. THAT THAT FOUR HAD- SO. JEFF BE THE FOR LINE- YEAH ALL REGIONS THOSE KINDS OF VEHICLES. ON THE WOULD BE AB VEHICLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT. I SO- SO WE CAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM REALLY MAKE A CASE FOR WHY EVEN THOUGH THIS. ARE FRONT VEHICLE NEED THAT LOOK YEAR REPLACEMENT CYCLE IS THAT FOR A FOR ALL THOSE CARS SO YOU'RE- ARE. GREAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THEY ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN LIFE BY ANYWAY WHEN THEY GET A NEW CAR THEY GET. ON AT L. AS PER OF THAT SO I DON'T CLEAR EYES WERE AT WHITE EVERYONE NEEDS REPLACE AND EVERY EXPENSIVE I THINK IT'S ABOUT- FOURTEEN. DOLLARS EACH SENATOR PER SO IF SOME TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER REALLY NEED BE REPLACED IT ON A- ONE OF THOSE THIRTY SIX HUNDRED- VEHICLES FIVE YEARS- AND THE CONSISTENCY. WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- WE THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THEY JUST THE AMOUNT OF ANY THAT'S IN. HERE WE THINKS CAN IN AB- OR TECHNO. AND VERY VALUABLE I'M JUST TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO THIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER REALLY THIS FULL PROPOSAL IS NECESSARY OR WHETHER. I'M TO MODIFY PROPOSAL THAT COULD FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE EIGHTY GALLON A SUBSET OF THE FLEET OR LONGER REPLACEMENT CYCLES MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT. I'M AND THEN FINALLY ON THE FEAR IS PROPOSAL AND YOU'RE RECOMMENDING LEGISLATURE DIRECT I'M COMPARING- YES REPORT. AYE BUT HEARINGS ON AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD FIND THIS PROPOSAL AT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE SO ADDS AND I WOULD ESTIMATE AND SEND MENTION AND- OTHERS THIS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IN- ORANGE COUNTY AND- IT'S BEEN PILOTED ITS AND OUT. THROUGH LOWER LEVEL OF SERVICE UNLESS COVERAGE THAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE. AND THE PROPOSAL MENTION THAT FOR EXAMPLE EXTENDING BACK- ORANGE COUNTY I HAVE BOB- ORANGE COUNTY- PILOT. IS ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD COST ABOUT THIRTY MILLION CIRCUMSTANTIALLY MORE THAN CONTINUING THAT PILOT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WORKS COUNTY ISN'T INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO CUT SO THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. I'M BUT- ONE OPTION COULD BE WELL THAT THE STATE. KNOW THAT. IF THEY WANT I THINK BEYOND IT'S LEVEL OF SERVICE ARE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP LEVEL SIR THAT. THAT'S BARTENDER PILOT. WE WOULD NOTE THE- DEPARTMENT HAS PRETTY SIMILAR OTHER. TO PROVIDE I'M SOME AERIAL SUPPORT THAT YOU KNOW AND RECONNAISSANCE KIND OF- OF. ADVANCED AND SATELLITE SATELLITE COVERAGE AS WELL SO THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT MISSION IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY- BUT THAT IT'S I'M PRETTY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE COVERAGE AND SO FIFTY. THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AS WELL AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OKAY WELL WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF. A THROUGH THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR FEAR AND- WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COST AND DO WE NEED TO GET THIS HIGHER LEVEL SERVICE SO WE'RE WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT BACK ON HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO EXPAND. EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE- UNDER CAL- YES IN CALIFORNIA- FOR THEM TO TAKE ON THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE THAT DECISION WHETHER WANT TO GO WITH- BUT THE TWO PLANES BASICALLY. OR THE ONE PLANE AND TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I SO ARE THOSE ARE TO RECOMMEND. WE HAD HAPPY TO ANY QUESTION- FROM THE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS GOOD- IS THERE ANY- FOLLOW UP FROM A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OH SORRY STRUCTURE YEAH- NO NO FOLLOW UP IN TERMS OF THE L. A. O.'S PRESENTATION BUT IT WON'T LET YOU KNOW THAT THE- HELLO YES HAS BEEN ABLE TO JOIN THE SHOULD HAVE AUDIO WITH THEM NOW SO A VERY MUCH ALIVE WHEN WE DO THAT I DO KNOW THAT- CHIEF FANTASY FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY WANTED TO. ADD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE FAIREST SYSTEM AS WELL. HI GOOD MORNING THE THIRTEEN OR THIRTY TO SEVENTY DIRECTOR ITALO YES SIMPLE YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW. YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR TECHNICAL STAFF VERY QUICKLY GETTING AT THE- THAT'LL HAPPEN PHONE NUMBER SO THAT WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT METHODOLOGY AND STEVEN BENSON AND EVERY DIRECTOR TYLER DID A DID A GREAT JOB INTERVIEW THING- OF COURSE ARE COMING TO RELATED TO THE VIRUS PC. AND THEY DID A GREAT JOB INTRODUCING IT I WON'T BE REDUNDANT WITH WHAT THEY COVER BUT I WOULD HAVE A IVE A COUPLE THINGS FIRST- WE'RE VERY VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PILOT THE SYSTEM WITH ORANGE COUNTY. FIRE AUTHORITY AS HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED- OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- IN THAT IN THAT TIME WE USED IT IN REAL WORLD INCIDENTS NOT JUST FOR WILDFIRES BUT FOR ALL HAZARDS. AND SO THEREFORE THIS PROPOSAL FOR THIRTY MILLION- AND THIRTY ONE POSITION IF THEY TAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL PILOT AND MOVE IT INTO THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEMS THAT SAME SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT- IS HERE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THAT WILDFIRE HAZARDS THAT INCREASING THREAT. AT THAT YOU'RE THAT THAT WE DISCUSSED ALREADY IN THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO OTHER DISASTERS WHICH OFTEN HAPPENED CONCURRENT WITH WILDFIRES AS WE HAVE THE- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SAID THIS TECHNOLOGY GIVES A THUMBS GIVE A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WASN'T- YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS IN THAT IT IS. DEDICATED AND THAT IS ABLE TO RAPIDLY DEPLOY FOR THOSE INITIAL ATTACK THEY GIVE A SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND DECISION TOOLS IN ORDER TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES QUICKLY PICKED TO CONTEND WITH TODAY'S WELL PARKER AT IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE RAPIDLY TO GIVE A SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FOR OTHER TYPE AMERICANS BEING LIKE EARTHQUAKES LIKE KONAMI- LIKE FOR IT CETERA. SHOW THE NEED FOR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN COVERAGE IN TWO PLANES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE PROPOSAL WELL AND GIVE US THAT CAPABILITY FOR REAL TIME WE DO HAVE EITHER- TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. ALL OF THEM WILL BE LEVERAGED THERE IS A LEAD TIME WITH SOME. OF THE MILITARY ASSETS AS WITH APPLE WITH MENTIONED- IN THE COMMON BEFORE- THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE. THE NO SO THAT OF THE- FOR INITIAL ATTACK IS REALLY KEY TO THIS AND IMPORTANTLY THIS IS BE PART OF THE MUTUAL. THE UTILIZES FOR MORE OF A- FOR WILDFIRES ALSO ALL. CAL IS A TREMENDOUS PARTNER. HELLO YES- WITH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND THEREFORE THIS ADVOCATES THAT PARTNERSHIP ON THE VIRUSES IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEVERAGING FULLY BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PILOT. I HAVE COLLEAGUES HERE- OUR CHIEF OF FIRE RESCUE BRIAN MARSHALL- IN THE ROOM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU AGAIN. WELL YOU GOT TO PARTICIPATE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO WE- HAVE- CHIEF FENNESSY AVAILABLE. GOOD MORE CHERUB CAN YOU ME OK. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AS I SIT HERE AND AS I READ THE PROPOSED BUDGET I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW- HOW GREAT IT FEELS TO TAKE A PROGRAM THAT WE ACTUALLY PRESENTED I BELIEVE YOU CO CHAIRED TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS SENATOR DODD AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD. AND THE SAME YEAR- FOR A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WAS WAS ALLOCATED BY THE STATE FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM. IT'S SINCE GROWN- I APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS. OF MAY THE DESCRIPTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION IS MADE BEFORE. OF ME COMING UP ONLINE- A COUPLE CORRECTIONS THE- THERE ARE TWO AIRCRAFT OPERATING THEIR STANDARD DAYS TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TWELVE HOURS BUT THEY'RE INTERCHANGEABLE SO- THE ENTIRE STATE. TODAY IT'S TWENTY FOUR HOUR COVERAGE. BUT ONE OF THE OTHER AIRCRAFT. WHAT I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT AND I THINK- CALCHAS IN CHIEF TYLER HIT ON THE HEAD. THIS IS A NATIONAL ATTACK RESOURCE THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING THE STATE OR EVEN THE UNITED STATES HAS RIGHT NOW- THESE AIRCRAFT LAUNCH ON THE REPORT THE FIRE. OF A FLOOD OIL SPILL TRAIN DERAILMENT THEY'VE DONE ALL THAT- THERE ONTO. THEIR OVER TOP OF THESE THESE ACTIONS VERY QUICKLY AND THE PROVIDING. LIVE STREAM VIDEO. YOUR TIME TO ON THEIR WAY VIDEO. MAPPING LANDOWNERS. UP OF THESE ANSWERS ALL WITHIN MINUTES OF ARRIVAL IN TODAY THAT INFORMATION IS GOING OUT TO HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF FIREFIGHTERS ON THEIR SMARTPHONES- LAST YEAR DURING A LARGE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE SCREENS OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER- WAS DEDICATED TO THE FIRES PLATFORM. SURE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR INFORMATION THAT WE HAVEN'T. WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THE PAST I GO BACK TO. RIDGECREST EARTHQUAKE WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS A FEW YEARS AGO AT THE COMMITTEE MEETING. RIDGECREST HAS YOU KNOW A COUPLE THREE HOURS DRIVE FROM LA NOT TOO FAR AWAY WE DID NOT HAVE REAL TIME CALLAWAY YES NOBODY HAD REAL TIME QUALITY INFORMATION FOR HOURS AFTER THAT EARTHQUAKE. TODAY IN THAT SAME SCENARIO. YOU WILL HAVE AN AIRCRAFT OVER THAT OVER ANY CITY ANY ERROR IN STATE MIGHT BE WITHIN A HALF AN HOUR YOU'RE GONNA GET LIVE STREAM. VIDEO YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANY AIRCRAFT THAT PROVIDES. THE ABILITY TO LOOK THROUGH CLOUT. THESE AIRCRAFT HAVE- I HAVE- TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS ON THEM SENSING SYSTEMS THAT NO OTHER HAS COLLECTIVELY- THE ABILITY TO SEE THROUGH CLOUT. THE BILL IT IS THE SOME INTO DAM SAYS WE'RE WE'RE- WITH UNITS OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO AND TIED INTO THE SUPER COMPUTER SYSTEM THERE AND- YOU KNOW THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. UCSD IS CLOSE TO HAVING WHAT WE WOULD CALL. HOME FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD WHICH IN THE FAR SERVICE THE ABILITY TO DO A WINDSHIELD SURVEY. OVER AN AREA THAT'S BEEN DAMAGED EITHER BY FIRE EARTHQUAKE WHATEVER IT IS SEE THROUGH CLOUD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU ADDRESSES- LOCATIONS OF A ONE BUILDINGS ARE STANDING WHICH ARE NOT WHICH ARE DAMAGED. WE'RE DOING FLOOD- PREDICTION MODELING. THEY'RE DOING WILDLAND FIRE- COME YEARS AGO EARLY IN THE PROGRAM THIS INFORMATION IN LOS ANGELES DURING A SANTA ANA WIND FIRE WAS WAS SENT TO- REAL TIME THE PHONE OF THE FIRE CHIEF IN LOS ANGELES. AND A FAST MOVING FIRE AT NIGHT MOVING INTO THAT COMMUNITY- AS WE ALL KNOW AND I'M SURE CHIEF TYLER MARSHALL WITH TEST TO WE HAVE THESE FIRES IT TAKES TIME TO ASSEMBLE ENOUGH RESOURCES. AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO EVACUATIONS THE PHARMACY WAS ABLE TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION THE SPREAD MOLLY NO MORE THE FIRE WAS GONNA HIT FIRST. GET THE CITIZENS OUT OF THOSE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE. IMPACTED RIGHT AWAY IN CONVERSELY HE SHARED WITH THE POLICE CHIEF OF LOS ANGELES WHO WAS ABLE TO GET HIS OFFICERS TO TARGET THOSE AREAS OF EVACUATION. TO WERE ABLE TO FOCUS RESOURCES IN THOSE AREAS THAT NEEDED THE MOST EARLY ON AND ALSO TARGET THOSE COMMUNITIES AND NEEDED TO BE EVACUATED. SO THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE RESOURCE- THERE ARE NO OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE THIS THE MILITARY AS- A ASSET BUT AS MENTIONED EARLIER. IT DOES TAKE TIME TO USE THEM. ALL CLOSE BY. YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. A MAN AND I. ERICA OR- OR ARE SIMPLY THIS. YOU IN A GAME MANTICORE CRAFT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO THE FOLKS IN THE AIRCRAFT HAVE THE ABILITY TO. GO LOOK AND MAKE DECISIONS WHILE AIRBORNE- THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT. THESE AIRCRAFT ARE STAFFED WITH US- A DOCTOR TECHNICAL GROUP SUPERVISORS THESE ARE OUR TAX. WE'VE GOT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN OUR ON CONTRACTORS FORMER U. S. FOREST SERVICE FOREST FORMER CAL FIRE. FORMER DEPARTMENT YOUR ERA TAXES LARGELY SEEN AS IT IS REALLY THE DREAM TEAM THESE FOLKS ARE ARE STILL ENGAGED IN TRAINING AND WORKING WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES. THESE FOLKS- HAVE HAVE. IMMENSE EXPERTISE EXPERIENCE AND GROUND OPERATIONS AND AVIATION OPERATIONS ARE ABLE TO TALK TO THE OTHER AIRCRAFT. WE HAVE A- A COUPLE AIR TANKER PILOTS- JUST THIS YEAR THAT. HAVE THE INFORMATION GOING TO THE PHONES. FOR US FOR PROVIDING THEM MORE IN. ABOUT IT INCIDENT THEY WERE FLYING TO THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IN TOLD IT ARRIVED. AND SO THIS IS A UNIQUE PROGRAM IT'S GROWING- IT'S GOT TO CLEAR THE AIR A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT ORANGE COUNTY IS NOT INTERESTED IN CONTINUING THIS. IT JUST REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO THAT AS MENTIONED EARLIER THESE ARE STATE. IT WAS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS GROWN HAS REALLY BECOME A STATE MUTUAL AID RESOURCE. HELLO YES IS THE CUSTODIAN OF THE CARETAKER THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM KALIFORNIA IS A BIG GO A PARTICIPANT IN THAT. I THINK IT IF YOU WERE TELLING TODAY THAT- WE WERE GOING TO RECEIVE SEVENTEEN MILLION TO PROVIDE THIS ON YOUR OWN BASIS I PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE IT'S NOT ENOUGH- IF YOU WANT TO OUR CRAFT I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAPPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AVAILABLE. YOU MAY. EVEN NEED A THIRD AS RESERVE- IT'S LIKE YOU'RE YOU MAY HAVE A OFFER. TO AND OF YOU BETTER SOMETHING- DECEIT PROGRAM GROW AND HEAR ABOUT TE POSITIONS THAT CALIFORNIA LOW YESTERDAY THE ISSUE. TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME. AND SO REALLY- I I'M HERE TO DO BAD INPUT TO CLARIFY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK THANK YOU- G. FANTASY. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND BETTER- HOW A- DRONE FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY FROM- MANNED AIRCRAFT. I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION- I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE IN THE AIR CAN MAKE. SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS- OR A QUICK DECISION SO- WOULDN'T. THOSE PEOPLE BE ON THE GROUND- IN THE CASE OF A DRONE WITH THOSE PEOPLE BE ONTHE GROUND AND JUST RELAYING. COMMANDS. TO THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT. IF YOU'RE- IF YOU HAVE RIGHT YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS EITHER YOU KNOW WAIT STARTED THE PROGRAM- IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH- GENERAL ATOMICS VERY LARGE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. COMPANY WE HAD THIS IDEA. IN THE MILITARY IS ABLE ANY WAR THEATER COMBAT YOU'LL GET THE TYPE OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SENSE YOU KNOW FOR US TO HAVE REAL TIME INFORMATION WHAT THEY SHARED WAS. AND WASN'T WELL KNOWN IS THAT. THERE ARE LIKELY MORE MANNED PLATFORMS IN WAR THEATER THAN UNMANNED. THE VALUE OF THE MANNED PLATFORMS JUST THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ADJUST QUICKLY BASED ON ONBOARD HUMAN INPUT. THEY CAN'T BE DONE YOU KNOW BY SOMEBODY FLYING A- HE DROWNED A LARGE OR SOMETHING ON THE GROUND BOTH HAVE. YOU NEED CAPABILITY. BUT THERE USED TO SO IT'S NOT SAY WITHOUT- THE NATIONAL GUARD PRESIDENT OF THE DROUGHT IS NOT NEEDED NO ABSOLUTELY YES AS ARE ALL OF THESE OTHER. OUR RESOURCES ARE. BUT HAVING SOMEBODY THAT IS TRAINING EXPERIENCE IN GROUND OPERATIONS- TO VALIDATE YOUR THE MODELS THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED FROM THE AIRPLANE. PROVIDED VIA SATELLITE- INPUT IN INSTANTLY MADE AVAILABLE TO THOSE ON THE GROUND COMMAND CENTERS. POLICY MAKERS- IS UNPARALLELED BUDGET YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD A TERRIBLE- THANK YOU- I HAVE A ARE THERE ANY OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR CHIEF FENNESSY. MISTER BENNETT. I'D I'VE I'VE LISTENED TO CAREFULLY TO YOUR ANSWER- CHIEF FANCY I KEEP FORGETTING THAT THE CAMERAS OVER HERE- AND- COULD YOU COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING SOMEBODY ON THE PLANE VERSUS HAVING SAY SOMEBODY A- COMMAND CENTER RECEIVING ALL THAT DATA FROM THE PLANE AND HAVING COMPLETE CONTROL OVER. ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PLANE. WE BOTH OBVIOUSLY HAVE MAN AND MAY I HAVE THEIR UNIQUE VALUES. VALUE TO MANNED AIRCRAFT IT IS SIMPLY THE US YOU KNOW FONG FLYING THE AIRCRAFT AND WERE OVER AN AREA THAT WE'RE MAPPING WE'RE DOING WHATEVER THAT THAT THAT TASK MAY BE. I SEE SMOKE OUT THE DISTANCE I SEE SOMETHING ELSE IT'S A LET LET'S GO CHECK THAT OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FLYING UNMANNED AIRCRAFT YOU KNOW THE SCREEN THAT THE INDIVIDUAL AND AS- A MANAGING- FLYING THAT AIRCRAFT IS LIMITED. SO THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO THAT- YOU KNOW THESE LARGER AIRCRAFT LARGELY FLY AND CERTAIN YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS. THESE ARE CRAFTING GUILD OR OF YOU KNOW MANOR CRICKET LOWER AMERICAN MANNED AIRCRAFT THESE ARE ALL PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT CAN GO HIGHER- THEY CAN COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE OTHER AIRCRAFT. IF NEEDED THE- DECISION MAKERS ON THE GROUND. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DANCE OFTEN ARE COMMUNICATING VIA TEXT- THE- TO OUR FOLKS AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER- PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IT'S JUST A YOU HAVE A LOT MORE VERSATILITY. IN CAPABILITIES WHEN YOU DO FROM- NECESSARILY. AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT THANK YOU. HELLO THANKS I'M SORRY A QUESTION I THINK WOULD BE FOR TYLER- THE- HELICOPTER REPLACEMENT PROGRAM AND THE- EMERGENCY SURGE CAPACITY THAT'S- OF BEING SOUGHT GRATEFUL TO SEE THIS PROGRAM MOVING ALONG IT WAS- NOT LONG AFTER I ARRIVED AND BEGAN CHAIRING. THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WE IDENTIFIED THE- BADLY NEEDED THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S NOW WELL UNDER WAY- BUT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- INCREASING OUR FLEET BY TWO HELICOPTERS- AND THE NOTION OF DOING THAT BUT LIMITING IT TO EMERGENCY SURGE CAPACITY I JUST DON'T GET THE DIFFERENCE I CAN UNDERSTAND I AM UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT. OF THESE HELICOPTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THEM AT ALL THEY HAVE TO HAVE CREWS AVAILABLE AND IF WE'RE HIRING CRUISE WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE SAME FASHION AS EVERY OTHER GROUP FOR ALL THE OTHER HELICOPTERS I THINK ULTIMATELY- AND PERHAPS YOU CAN- HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE THE- DEMAND FOR SERVICE. IS GOING TO BE WHAT DETERMINES THE USE OF THESE HELICOPTERS AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT- THE NOTION OF SEARCH CAPACITY- OR OF OR OF USING THEM IN A SEARCH- SITUATION BUT- IF WE NEED THE HELICOPTERS- BUT WHY WOULD WE- WHY WOULD WE LIMIT THEM TO THAT ROLE WE DON'T LIMIT WE DO SEARCH. NOW WHY WOULD WE WANT TO LIMIT FUTURE HELICOPTERS TO- TO ONLY THAT MISSION. SIR THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR THE QUESTION- SO AS YOU'RE GONE FOR THE- HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE- THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION APPROVED- CALIFORNIA FORWARD TO PURCHASE- TWELVE- BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS. TEN ARE IN THE FRONT LINE- STATUS CRISTINA HELLO HELLO TECH BASES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TWO OF THOSE HELICOPTERS ARE- IN THE PURPOSES OF RESERVES- TO BE ABLE TO. BRING THE FRONTLINE HELICOPTERS IN OUT OF MAINTENANCE- WHILE KEEPING THOSE TWO RESERVES AVAILABLE- TO- TO SUPPLEMENT THOSE AIRCRAFT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THAT PROPOSAL- PART OF THAT PROPOSAL WAS FLYING FIVE OF THE TEN BASES TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY- IN THE REASON WE DID SO WAS BECAUSE- FIVE OF THOSE HELICOPTERS WOULD HAVE TANKS AND FIVE OF THOSE HELICOPTERS WOULD HAVE BUCKETS. WE CAN'T FIND A FIVE BUCKET HELICOPTERS AT NIGHT WITH AN EXTERNAL LOAD- OVER SOME OF THOSE AREAS. AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THE CONTRACT WE ENDED UP TAKING ALL TEN OF THOSE HELICOPTERS BUT WE STILL ONLY FUNDED- FIVE OF THOSE BASES TO FLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU SEE SEARCH CAPACITY BLENDS INTO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- ENHANCEMENT- THAT IS GOING TO BE WORKED THROUGH WITH- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE DEPARTMENT- KELLY JAR AND- THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. GOING TO BE USED. SO IN PART OF THAT THE- IS THAT- IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE FUNDING TO TURN THE FIVE FLYING ALL TEN OF THE HELICOPTERS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WHICH REQUIRE INCREASED STAFFING. WELL WHEN YOU ADD THE TEN HELICOPTERS INTENDED TO FLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR- YOUR FLIGHT HOURS IT'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR MAINTENANCE NEEDS- AND THEREBY IS THE REQUEST IN THE ADVERSITY SURGE CAPACITY PROPOSAL FOR FOUR ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS. THAT COULD BENEFIT SUPPLEMENT THOSE INCREASED OURS IN THE FIRST TEN HELICOPTERS- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FIREHAWK HELICOPTERS FLYING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT- THOSE HELICOPTERS THAT WOULD INITIALLY BE BASED OUT OF MCCLELLAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO- COULD BE MOVED ACROSS THE STATE AND STAFF WITH ADDITIONAL- PERSONNEL THAT WE HAVE. THROUGH STAFFING PATTERNS ENOUGH WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WERE FLYING THEM WHEN WE HAVE CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. ON IT IT HELPS BUT I HAVE TO BE FRANK WITH YOU THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HEARD. THAT SOME OF THE HELICOPTERS THAT WERE- COMING ONLINE- WERE NOT EQUIPPED WITH TWENTY FOUR HOUR- CUT CAPACITY- EVERY TIME I'VE EVER REFERRED TO THESE HELICOPTERS AND COMMITTEE- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WITH A SENSE OF. PRIDE IN THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WERE GOING FROM- FLEET OF HELICOPTERS THAT WERE ONLY AVAILABLE PART TIME TO- HELICOPTERS THAT WERE AVAILABLE- THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO I HAVE TO SAY IT COMES AS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO ME THAT- THAT. THAT THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE AND- BABY- I NEED TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP MEETING TO UNDERSTAND JUST THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THE- STATUS OF THE PROGRAM- I. FULLY SUPPORT- INCREASING THIS CAPACITY- TO THE EXTENT WE CAN WITH AND- OF THE REASONABLE LIMITS OF THE BUDGET- BECAUSE THESE- A CRAFTER ARE ARE SO IMPORTANT. HI SO I DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN BUT I WANT TO SEE THEM USED TO THEIR MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY AS WELL SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED- BUT MAYBE NOT WHERE WE WERE AT IT. THAT'S THAT'S THE SURPRISE- WELL IT WELL I HAVE YOU CHIEF- LET ME ASK A QUESTION- THAT IS- HOPEFULLY FORWARD THINKING- AND SOMETHING THAT I'VE I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF WONDERED AND THAT IS- AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME AND AS WE SEE THE NEED FOR. ADVANCED THE TECHNOLOGY AND AN AIRCRAFT AND SO FORTH IT. HI CAN YOU CORRECTLY- BUT I AM I AM OF THE BELIEF THAT THEIR- HERE IN CALIFORNIA- TEXAS WHERE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF- AIRCRAFT- THAT ARE USED- AROUND THE COUNTRY OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE WORLD THERE'S A- ONGOING AND INCREASING NEED FOR- A FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT TO FULFILL VERY VERY. SPECIFIC MISSION YES IT'S MY UDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE AIRCRAFT THAT IS DESIGNED FROM THE BOTTOM UP. TO FIGHT FIRES IN SPITE OF THIS GREAT NEED- WHEREAS AT LEAST IN A MILITARY CONTEXT- THERE ARE- AIRCRAFT THAT ARE FREQUENTLY BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC MILITARY MISSION SO- WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT SOMETHING'S GONNA AND I REALIZE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIRCRAFT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEAR- TIMELINES FOR DELIVERY OF ACTUALLY ACTUAL PRODUCT BUT- I THINK WE CAN PROJECT OUT THAT FAR IN TERMS OF- OF- THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE NEED FOR FIGHTING FIRES- AND PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO BE- LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT WAY. RATHER THAN. KINKA EQUIPMENT THAT'S AVAILABLE OFF THE SHELF AND ADAPTING THEM BUT LONG TERM MAYBE- LOOKING AT STARTING TO DESIGN EQUIPMENT FROM THE GROUND UP BUT WE SEE SO MUCH OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTUALLY DOES- A ADDRESS TO FIRE ISSUE IN THAT WAY. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AS WELL SO- SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WHEN WE LOOK AT ROTARY WING- OR HELICOPTERS SPECIFICALLY- I CAN'T THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH FOR INVESTING IN THE S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTER PROGRAM IS THE FIRST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAD A BRAND NEW HELICOPTER. BROUGHT INTO THE FLEET- AND WE SEE THAT A FEW AREAS ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- SO MUCH APPRECIATE THERE WHEN WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT A FIXED WING. AIR TANKERS- YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE BETWEEN WHAT IS STATE OWNED AND WHAT IS PRIVATELY OWNED. ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE NATION YOU ARE CORRECT THERE ARE LARGELY IN PART AT REVISED AIRCRAFT FROM DIFFERENT AREAS OF TIME. THAT A RETROFITTING AND- BY PRIVATE VENDORS- TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OTHER WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING MISSION ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE NATION- WHETHER THAT BE- ARE CURRENTLY THE BEST U. T. GRAHAM AND- AIR TANKERS THAT WERE REALLY WORLD WAR TWO SUBMARINE HUNTERS. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE U. H. ONE H. HELICOPTERS THAT WERE USED IN VIETNAM- WORDS SAYING RETROFITS OF- JETLINERS. AND OUR TANKS ARE BEING ADDED AND THEY'RE ALL VERY QUALITY AIRCRAFT THERE RE UTILIZED AND I REMEMBER AS CHAIR BLOOM WHENWE TALKED ABOUT THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM- SOME NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED WAS WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD AN AIR TANKER FROM THE GROUND UP SO WE HAD DONE THAT RESEARCH INITIALLY. AND A LOCKHEED MARTIN AT THE TIME WAS- OFFERING A BRAND NEW- C. ONE THIRTY J. MODEL- AIRCRAFT- WITH A BASE PRICE OF ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT POINT FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS TO GET OFF THE GROUND AND I THINK THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. WHAT THE NEEDS OF OUR GREAT STATE- WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT OPTIONS OF WHETHER CONTINUING. TO RE UTILIZE AIRCRAFT WERE TO YOU- PURCHASE NEW AS YOU SEE BACK. WELL I THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I THINK- I'D LIKE TO AGAIN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN WITH YOU- IF. GETTING THAT- OF IT GETTING FORWARD MOVEMENT ON THAT- A TYPE OF A PROJECT- REQUIRE SOME- HELP THE FROM THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE- THE SPECIFIC ANSWERS HERE AND WHAT THAT AIRCRAFT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO- PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT BECAUSE THESE THIS WOULD BE A- I DO KNOW THE DESIGNING AIRCRAFT- IS A VERY VERY- EXPENSIVE AND LABOR INTENSIVE. PROPOSITION SO IF SOMETHING IS TO TALK ABOUT- THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE A- IS A ASKING FOR A FOLLOW UP TO- THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT ABOUT THE- VEHICLE LOCATOR PROGRAM IN THE EXPANSION FROM TWELVE HUNDRED TO THIRTY SIX HUNDRED VEHICLES- I GUESS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS. WHY DOES EVERY VEHICLE IN THE FLEET NEED TO HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY ADDED- WHEN ONLY A- I ONLY A FRACTION OF THE- VEHICLES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ACTUALLY. BE OUT IN THE FIELD THE IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU NEED THAT. CAPABILITY I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AS WELL- CHERRY BLOOM- SO AS YOU KNOW ACCOUNT BY REALLY IS A TOTAL FORCE CONCEPT AND WHEN WE WERE- GRATEFUL TO HAVE-THIS APPROVED IN THE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN A BUDGET CYCLE- B. INITIAL PHASE WAS IN FACT THE TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS APART ACROSS TWELVE HUNDRED VEHICLES WHICH WERE THE FRONT LINE VEHICLES ACROSS STATE CALIFORNIA- FOR CALIFORNIA- SPECIFICALLY THEY HAVE AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION AS WELL AS A MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. LOCATED WITHIN THE VEHICLE- THAT ALLOWS US TO SEND INFORMATION TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE THOSE VEHICLES WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR INCIDENT NOW WE KNOW THAT- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED VEHICLES IN THE FLEET. THIS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED- WOULD ADD A TOTAL OF THIRTY SIX THERE ARE CERTAINLY VEHICLES WITHIN THE FLEET THAT WOULD NOT HAVE- ABL AND NDTV'S PLACED ON THEM OF COURSE THOSE ARE LARGELY CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT TRAILERS AND THINGS OF THE SORT THAT WE WOULDN'T REASONABLY EXPECT THOSE TO BE. PLACED ON THOSE VEHICLES BUT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT- OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THAT OF KNOWING THAT- THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE UNITS THAT ARE READY TO BE INSTALLED IN A BRAND NEW VEHICLE IT'S GOING OUT TO THE FIELD IS AN OLD VEHICLE COMES IN FOR SURVEY- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT. REMOVED EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS- THAT VEHICLES HAVE TO GO IN FOR MAINTENANCE- VEHICLES ARE PLACED OUT OF SERVICE AND WHEN WE DO THAT- WE PLACE RESERVE APPARATUS OR SURGEON HORRENDOUS AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL- IN THE SERVICE AND IT ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS POLLING- THE- THE A. B. L. N. M. B. T. UNITS. OUT OF ONE VEHICLE AND PLACING IT INTO ANOTHER THEIR PARMALEE HARD MOUNTED- UNITS WITHIN EACH OF THOSE VEHICLES. NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THE VEHICLES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN GOING BACK TO TOTAL FORCE I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- DURING THE CALAR FIRES THE FIRE BURNED OVER THE TOP. OF ECHO SUMMIT IN THE LAKE TAHOE REASONABLY ONE WOULD THINK THAT ME MYSELF AND MY VEHICLE WOULDN'T NEED- A MOBILE DATA TERMINAL OR- AVIELLE. YET IN FACT I WAS SITTING ON THE ECHO SUMMIT AS THE FIRE BLEW OVER THE TOP AND WENT DOWN INTO CHRISTMAS VALLEY AND THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN- LIKEWISE- ONE MIGHT QUESTION WHY- VEHICLES SUCH AS THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL MIGHT NEED- BOTTOM OUT OF VEHICLE LOCATION AND HE'D M. D. T. ON A SCAN TO. OTHER VEHICLES THAT WE USE- THOSE FOLKS ON THE CRITICAL FUNCTION OF DAMAGE ASSESSMENT WHEN WE PUT THEM OUT ON THE FIRE LINE TO ASSESS- BURN. DAMAGE AND DESTROYED STRUCTURES- WHY. A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT- WILL. GO OUT AN ANSWER AND PER MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS IN INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM. ARENAS AS WELL AS- WATERSHED ASSESSMENT AND- POST- POST FIRE- VIOLENT SUPPRESSION REPAIR. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS LEADERS IN THE ORGANIZATION AS INCIDENT COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND. TO ENSURE THAT WE KNOW. THE LOCATION OF. ALL OF THESE RESOURCES ON THE INCIDENT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY BEING ABLE TO PRE POSITION THEM OR MOVE THEM INTO OTHER AREAS WHERE FIRE MAY BE GOING. BY WATCHING THEM ON ON A MAP. ACTIVE ACTIVELY THERE. AS WELL AS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INITIAL ATTACK ACTIVITY AGAIN BEING IN A RESERVE APPARATUS- YOU MIGHT FIND. THAT THAT RESERVE APPARATUS IS MOVING WITHIN THEIR FIRE DISTRICT MAY BE CLOSER TO ANOTHER FIRE DISTRICT AND THEREFORE DYNAMIC DISPATCHING WILL ALWAYS DISPATCH THE CLOSEST RESOURCE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S A FRONT LINE RESOURCES BEING STAFF WERE RESERVE APPARATUS. I HOPE THAT HELPS. IT DOES THANK YOU- I'M SURE- ON A STAFF LEVEL THEY'LL PROBABLY BE MARK- QUESTIONS- ABOUT THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING ENOUGH THERE'S- DATA AVAILABLE WITH THE- WITH RESPECT TO THE USAGE OF VEHICLES AS YOU AS YOU REFER TO- THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO COMBAT THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SAY- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOURNALISM- NUMBER ONE JUST IN THE QUICKEST I WASN'T PLANNING ON THIS BUT WHEN YOU MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT- PLANNING- FIRE CRAFT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE AIRCRAFT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FIGHT FIRES WILDLAND FIRES IN PARTICULAR- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK- GIVEN- THE DIRECTION OF- WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA DID DOES MAKE SOME SENSE FOR US TO PAY SOME ATTENTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PASS ON AN EXPERIENCE I HAD WHEN I WAS IN ITALY- ONE A- FIRE BROKE OUT. I WATCHED TANKER AFTER TANKER. AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN T AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THEM AND THEY WERE FLYING IN A- HUGE PATTERN- ONE WOULD COME DOWN AND LITERALLY FILL IN THE OCEAN. THE TANKER ITSELF CAME. HIT THE OCEAN. AND THE ACCELERATED AS HARD AS I COULD AND THEY WERE PICKING UP WATER. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS AN AIRCRAFT THAT WAS ADAPTED FOR BUT IF IT WAS ADAPTED IT WAS. PRETTY MAJOR ADAPTION SO THERE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE DOING IN ITALY TEN YEARS AGO- AND THEY WERE ABLE TO RAPIDLY ONE LANDED THEN THE NEXT ONE WOULD COME AND THEY WERE JUST MAKING A CIRCLE RIGHT OVER THE FIRES GIVEN THAT OUR PROXIMITY TO THE COAST. AND HOW MANY OF OUR FIRES OF THAT WAYS OF THAT MAYBE SOME AIRCRAFT THAT WE- THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR THE BOTTOM- BUT I DON'T KNOW OF OR WAS AT THE ADOPTED IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE ALMOST LIKE. C. ONE THIRTY THERE WERE ADOPTED WITH THEIR- WITH THAT WITH THE SCOOP IN FRONT RATHER THAN THAT AND BACK- SO I JUST OFFER THAT BUT- YOU KNOW. THE HEARING ABOUT THE- AND I DON'T KNOW IF PRONOUNCING THIS BUT THE FOR. SYSTEM THE IN THIS THERE- HI HI I AM- AT- HE- DID NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS WHOLE FIELD OF. WILDFIRE PREVENTION EXCITER BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME FROM A COMMON SENSE STANDPOINT. THAT IF WE COULD ATTACK THESE THINGS RIGHT WHEN THEY START. AND REALLY BRING A LOT OF RESOURCES. OF WE COULD SAVE A LOT OF. PROPERTY A LOT OF RISK EXPENSE AND TREMENDOUS ENERGY- AND CHILL OVERALL I'M VERY INTERESTED IN- THE INITIAL RESPONSE- BEING OF BECOMING MORE ROBUST BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP AT ACROSS THE STATE- AND SO GENERALLY- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. BUT IT DOES I THINK- LEAD ME TO THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT STAFF WAS REFERRING TO AND THAT IS- AS AS A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE PLAN. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF RESOURCES WHAT. WHAT PART OF THE PLAN HOW HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS ADDITIONAL- RESPONSE RAPID RESPONSE IN IN AN OVERALL STRATEGIC PLAN AND HOW ROBUST SHOULD IT BE- HOW MUCH GAIN WOULD WE GET THERE ON ONE HAND VERSUS THE OTHER. AND SO MY QUESTION FOR CAL FIRE IS CAL FIRE OPPOSED TO CREATING A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE PLANNED- IN THE END IF NOT WHAT ARE THE HURDLES- FOR ACTUALLY GETTING THAT DONE. AND IF THEY ARE WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO IT. NO WELL THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M GONNA DRESSES AND INTO PIECES FIRST AND FOREMOST- THE STREET THE STREET SHE TRISTIQUE FIRE PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WAS LAST PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY OWNER FRANK TODAY ABOUT THE STRATEGIC FIRE PLAN REACH WERE REFERRING TO. WHAT WAS ASKED OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE PROVIDED TO THEM RELATED TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND- AND THE STRATEGIC THINKING OR STANDARD TO COVER OF WHAT WE WOULD HEAR. FROM A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS ON HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO GET THEM THERE THE QUICKEST. FOR AIRCRAFT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALREADY HAVE THAT IN PLACE FOR AIRCRAFT SPECIFICALLY IT'S OUR GOAL TO HAVE AN INITIAL SACK AIRCRAFT OVER ANY FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES AND REASONABLY I THINK BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS WE DO AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THAT WE CAN ALWAYS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE- AND SO FROM A- AIR TANKER. HELICOPTER PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE'RE GOOD THERE. SO WHAT THE- PROGRAM REALLY FOCUSES ON IS- AND WHAT THE REPORT COULD FOCUS ON LARGELY IS- THE ALLOCATION OF ENGINES CREWS- AND. BULLDOZERS- YEAH AND FROM THAT ACCOUNT ARE CERTAINLY IS NOT OPPOSED IT- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE REPORT WAS DUE BY APRIL FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW AND WITH WITH ALL RESPECT- WE WERE DRAFTING THAT REPORT- BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE IT TO THE LEVEL IN WHICH WE FELT IT WAS A READY TO BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. LARGELY BECAUSE WE DIVERTED OUR ATTENTION IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY- COMMITTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES A PART OF THE- LARGER STATE CALIFORNIA PLAN TO THE COVE IN PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION TO THAT- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE WHERE LARGE COMET JING AND DISASTERS FIRE YEARS AND WE KNOW THE CAL FIRE'S CRITICALLY. SHORT WITH IT STOPPING RIGHT NOW I AM COMMITTED WITH MY PARTNERS- TO REESTABLISH AND- AND BRING FOR THIS PLAN FOR YOU. I INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU- MY- OTHER QUESTION IS- WITH REGARDING THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND TO THE- THIRTY SIX HUNDRED VEHICLES- I TRIED TO DO SOME OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE COST- AND- HE- CAN YOU EITHER. YEAH I DO YOU HAVE AN IDENTIFIED COST PER VEHICLE- OR CAN YOU GET THAT TO ME- RELATIVELY QUICKLY IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COST WOULD FOR BE A- FIFTY PER VEHICLE WOULD BE- OF- THIS THIS REQUEST. YES SIR- I HAVE MY DEPUTY CHIEF OVER THIS PROGRAM TIMOTHY PERSON ON THE LINE- IF HE KNOWS THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW OFFICE SAID LET'S GIVE IT IF NOT WE WILL CERTAINLY GET THAT INFORMATION BACK TO YOU. CHIEF I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WAS SOLD. ALL RIGHT WE WILL OF PRESENT BACK YOU IN SHORT ORDER WITH THAT NUMBER IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH WE CAN WE CAN ALL GET THAT INFORMATION I THINK- OUR STAFF MAY ACTUALLY HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON IT- SO WE CAN- ASK IN THAT WAY ALSO- BUT IT IS A- AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S- OF OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO- PER VEHICLE AND THEN THERE'S AN ONGOING COSTS THROUGH- TO MAINTAIN- DOES NOT INCONSEQUENTIAL. WAS GREAT MIKE MY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE WAS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO LIKE I'VE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WAS. WAS ROUGHLY ON THAT I DON'T KNOW. HOW YOU FIGURE. OUT OF THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE BUT- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT BALLPARK. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO A PUBLIC COMMENT NOW THANK YOU- TO- ALL OF- OF THIS MORNING'S PARTICIPANTS- FOR YOUR- PRESENTATIONS AND- LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THE PHONE NUMBER FOR CALLING IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. 1-757-877-6928 NINE FIVE SEVEN WITH THE PUBLIC ACCESS CODE OF ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SEVEN. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SEVEN AND IF YOU ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS CALL. WILL ASSIST YOU- IS THERE ANYONE IN THE. WHO ARE GETTING THE MICROPHONE READY AS WE SPEAK. I THINK WE HAVE- AT LEVY- I JUST SAY THAT- WILL BE- IMPOSING A SPEAKING LIMIT OF- ONE MINUTE. PLEASE ADD TO. WE'RE ALMOST READY. GREAT TO HAVE- TO PEOPLE- HI HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM- WHO WILL PROVIDE THAT TESTIMONY AND THEN WILL BE MOVING TO- TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE WELCOME A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON WITH PACIFIC FOREST TRUST IT'S REALLY DELIGHTFUL TO SEE THIS MORNING THANKS FOR GOOD HEARING MY COMMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON THE WILDFIRE- INVESTMENT PACKAGE AND THE TASK FORCE. FOR THE ONE IS COULD YOU KNOW COMMAND THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REALLY SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST YEAR IN THAT CONTEXT I'LL JUST SAY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN AMBITION AND WHILE ONE POINT TWO BILLION OVER TWO YEARS SOUNDS LIKE A BIG NUMBER IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SUBSTANTIAL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT WE HAD FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. SO IF I NEED TO MORE IN THAT BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR AN ONGOING. BASIS THE SECOND OLDEST ECHO WHAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE I MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALIGNING. THESE THE ACTIONS THEY WERE TAKING FOR WILDFIRE. VEHICLE IN THE CONTEXT OF TRYING TO MODIFY MILLION ACRES A YEAR OF YOU KNOW FOREST OTHER HABITATS. WITH OUR CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY THESE OTHER STATE GOALS MAKE SURE THOSE ARE WELL INTEGRATED. TO THE WE CAN EITHER DO GREAT THINGS FOR THE STATE OR BECAUSE A LOT OF HARM ALONG THE WAY- THIRD THING. IS WE REALLY NEED TO MAINTAIN. AND INCREASE OUR PROGRESS ON USING A FIRE PRO ACTIVELY ON THE LANDSCAPE YOU KNOW PRESCRIBED FIRE CULTURAL FIRE. REALLY RECOGNIZING THE CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BURN WE JUST CONTROL THE TIMING. AND THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE A CULTURAL SHIFT AND IMPLEMENT A MISSION FIFTH WITH CAL FIRE AND OTHER AGENCIES. THE LEGISLATORS DONE GREAT THE LAST FEW YEARS. I HAVE THE SOME YELLOW FLAGS ON THE HORIZON IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN ON THE TABLE. YOU COULD READ LAST LEE- WITH REGARD TO THE TASK FORCE ALL JUST FLAG THAT- I'VE BEEN TRACKING THEM VERY CLOSELY I THINK IT'S GONE QUITE WELL. AND HAVING AN ENTITY THAT CROSSES BETWEEN THE FEDERAL THE STATE THE LOCAL THE TRIBAL. AND IS OUTSIDE OF CALL FIRE IN CAN REALLY DRAW ALL THOSE DIFFERENT. THREADS TOGETHER IS REALLY. VALUABLE SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS CHRIS MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY THREE QUICK ITEMS- WE DO APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE MADE BUT ACTUALLY WOULD CONCUR WITH MR MASON THAT. OUR COMPANIES BELIEVE MORE SHOULD BE DONE AND MORE SHOULD BE FUNDED. THE SECOND IS AS WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MISS REAVIS AND MISTER SMITH ABOUT BIOMASS. OUR COMPANY HAS DONE AN ESTIMATE WE THINK IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDIES FOR BIOMASS AND THEN THE THIRD ITEM IS. BASED UPON WHAT WE HEARD TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR HAVING ONE PERSON IN CHARGE. WHETHER IT'S ENSURING THAT WE ACHIEVE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY. OR WHAT NOT WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE PERSON IN CHARGE. OF MY CLIENT LIKES ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD SAYS WE CAN EITHER HAVE FIRES WHEN MOTHER NATURE WANTS THEM OR WHEN WE WANT THEM. WE'VE SEEN THE DAMAGE WHEN MOTHER NATURE HAS WANTED THEM THE STATE HAS TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WILL MOVE TO THE TELEPHONE LINES NOW. OPERATOR CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES SERVICE CHAIR THANK YOU RIGHT TO JOIN THE COMMENT Q. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD ONCE AGAIN THAT'S ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. FIRST COUNT WE HAVE SIX LINES IN Q. ARE YOU READY FOR THE FIRST COMMENT. YES ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU LINE THIRTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD ONE THREE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS THE HIGHLAND PELLETS AND WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY COMMEND GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN THE LEGISLATURE POPPING AND UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET PACKAGE LAST YEAR SPECIFICALLY A HISTORIC ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RIDGE LANE. WE ALSO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING A NEW ONE POINT TWO BILLION INVESTMENT OVER TWO YEARS WHICH DEMONSTRATES ITS CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO PROACTIVE MEASURES TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S MEGA FIRED. HE'S ALREADY COMMITTED INVESTMENTS AND THOSE BEING PROPOSED ACCELERATE CLIMATE PREPAREDNESS AND SHOW A COMMITMENT TO BOTH PEOPLE AND NATURE. HOWEVER TNT BELIEVES ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHAT ABOUT THE VALUE WAITING THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE EXPENDITURE PLAN. I BELIEVE THE PLAN SHOULD AT A MINIMUM BE INCREASED TO TWO BILLION OVER TWO YEARS. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL CONTINUES TO SUPPORT CRITICAL INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS DROUGHT AND THE INCREASING WILDFIRE THREAT. HOWEVER THE WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS MISSING DETAILS ON THE BUDGET PACKAGE FROM LAST YEAR PARTICULARLY ON ACTION TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO ENSURE THAT A LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN IS ESTABLISHED FOR WILDFIRE DROUGHT RESILIENCE. AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE MADE IN NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS CRACK BIODIVERSITY AND HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE ITS CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT COMMENT IS FROM LINE THIRTY THREE ZERO. THE MYSTERY CARE MEMBERS BRANDON KILLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. SENDING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER SMALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ADOPT STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED BUDGET FUNDING OF TWO MILLION EACH YEAR FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE AND THEN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FOR CONTINUANCE OF THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM. WHICH IS HELPING TO MEET THE GOAL OF CREATING ONE MILLION ACRES OF VEGETATION ANNUALLY BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS IDENTIFIED IN THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS WILDFIRE EVENTS BECOME MORE COMMON AND SEVERE EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS AN AREA THAT IS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ATTENTION FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. HOWEVER DUE TO THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR THIS ACTIVITY AND RESTRICTIONS ON HOW LOCAL FUNDING CAN BE USED THEIR DISTRICTS ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND ASSISTANCE TO DO THE JOB. THE NEW BUDGET APPROPRIATION FOR A DISTRICT EMERGENCY RESPONSE RELATED FUNDING. WOULD ALLOW US TO TRAIN AND PROVIDE. RESOURCES ADVISORS FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD FOCUS ON MONITORING AND CORDINATION OF SMOKE ACTIVITIES DURING ACTIVE WILDFIRE EVENTS INCLUDING PUBLIC OUTREACH TO INFORM PEOPLE OF HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS AND THEN PROVIDE ADVICE ON APPROPRIATE RESPONSE AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME MISTER. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN NEXT TO WE HAVE LINE. TWENTY FIVE TWO FIVE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS MADELINE ACT ON BEHALF OF THE NUMBER OF CONSERVATION CLIENTS INCLUDING SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE CAN FLOURISH IN OPEN SPACE TRUST AND CALVINISTIC PARKS FOUNDATION CALLING SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT COMMON IS. ONE TWENTY NINE TO NINE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THIS IS MARK SPENCER MAKER CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE WATERSHED RESEARCH AND TRAINING CENTER I WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR OF WILDFIRES GOING INSPECTED BASELINE AND REALLY ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE INVESTING MORE. AYE WE'VE CORD SUPPORT AND KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE INVESTMENT IN FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS. BUT ALSO CALL THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY RAMPING UP OUR INVESTMENTS. AND NON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND AGENCIES SO THE HOME HARDENING IT ACTUATION READY MESS MOKRI BILLIONS YOU KOW THE WILD FIRES ARE GONNA KEEP COMING WE HAVE TO BE INVESTING IN. THE COMMUNITY READY MASS SIDE AS WELL. AND LAST YEAR JUST LIKE REGISTER OUR SUPPORT FOR THE R. AFFECTS FUND ACCORDING NEED FOR PROJECT PLANNING. AND CRIME. A AND CAPACITY AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS NO CURE FUNDING PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE LINE TWENTY TWO. MORNING IT'S A CHAIR MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OUR MONTHLY JOURNAL BE APT TO CALIFORNIA BY MAP ENERGY ALLIANCE. ISSUE ONE CAL FIRE TVA LIKE IT'S EXPECTED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED FUNDING FOR THE POOREST HELP GRANT PROGRAM IN THE WOOD PRODUCTS AND BIO ENERGY PROGRAM ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS HELP MANAGE FIVE EXISTING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING ALKALOIDS. WHICH IS IN DESPERATE. NEED AND IF THEY'RE IN THIS AREA. TBA ALL BECAUSE OF THAT MILLION DOLLARS YUKON FOR THE- OF BIOMETRIC. DID FUNDS WILL TRY THE HARDER TO GET MATERIAL AND HELP MOVE MORE DEAD TREE PILED AROUND THE STATE TO A BENEFICIAL BEES PROJECTS. HOW WE ARE GEARED UP WITH THIS ITEM WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE THANK YOU LINE. TWENTY THREE TO THREE- GOOD MORNING CHERRY BLOOM AND NUMBERS OR YEAH JUST GOOD MORNING STEVEN MYERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS. THE FOURTEENTH ST LOS CERTIFIED LOCAL CORES ARE HAPPY TO SEE THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF A WILDFIRE WORKS RESILIENCE PACKAGE I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO BE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND THE WIDER ISSUE OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE WITH A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WE'RE PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL FOR THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS FOR FUEL BREAKS AND FUEL REDUCTION WORK THE LOCAL COURTS WILL BE CRITICAL PARTNERS TO THE CCC AND CREATING HIGHER RESILIENCY ACROSS THE STATE. FROM THE NORTH BAY TO SAN DIEGO AND FROM THE COAST. TO THE SIERRA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING OUT TO LINE. THIRTY THREE THREE THREE. MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE- THE DEVASTATING FIRES IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OBVIOUSLY ARE A MATTER OF RECORD HERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST THAT THE NEW NORMAL WILL NOT CONTINUE- THIS YEAR- WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET AND THE ATTENTION MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN BLOOM. ON THE COMMITTEE I CAME TO INFRASTRUCTURE STAFFING INTO PREPARATION FOR WE KNOW WILL BE A VERY DIFFICULT HERE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU. AND WE'LL GO TO LINE THIRTY ONE THREE ONE. MISTER TURN MEMBERS CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH FOR. CANACCORD DEPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE PREVENTION COURT COULD GOING THE PROPOSAL AND ESPECIALLY THE MULTI YEAR APPROACH THAT HAS- CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT A POSITIONAL INVESTMENT THOUGH ARE NECESSARY SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA THE REQUESTED DIGITAL FUND SEEK BEFOREHAND TO CREATE. AS THE PROPOSAL FALLS SHORT OF WHAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO THE FIRE BEEN SURE THAT KILL BENCHMARK TO BE COMPLETED DURING THE OFF SEASON- ADDITIONALLY THE ACCUMULATION OF WOODY MATERIAL GENERATED THROUGH FOREST MANAGEMENT PRODUCT PROJECT IN POST FIRE RECOVERY IS A GROWING PROBLEM AND THEREFORE- BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE STATE FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS THEREFORE. CAL FOR ITS REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE INCREASE. THE FUNDING. AFTER PROPOSED FOR BY ABOUT TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM AT THE YOU AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU MISTER AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINES IN Q. WELL GREAT- THANK YOU OPERATOR FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND JOB THAT BRINGS OUR HEARING TO A CONCLUSION WE WILL STAND ADJOURNED THANK YOU ALL.
