COMMENT RIGHT HERE I'M- GO AHEAD YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAINED AUTHOR WHO I AGREE WITH ON MANY THINGS ON THIS ONE WE VERY VIGOROUSLY DISAGREE. I'M GOING TO SPEAK FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE TODAY THE VICTIMS OF CRIME. NOT JUST THE- SO CALLED LOW LEVEL CRIME. AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. BURGER A SECOND LOW LEVEL TRYING PROPERTY CRIME NO BIG DEAL. WELL IT'S A LIFE SENTENCE. AND PEOPLE WILL SAY OH NO NO THAT'S YOU DON'T GET A LICENSE SERVER VERY SECOND. NO YOU DON'T. BUT THE VICTIM DOES THINK OF THE MOTHER WHO'S COMING HOME IN A DARKENED HOME. THAT HAS BEEN BURGLED WITH THEIR CHILDREN AT NIGHT. AND EVERY TIME SHE DOES SHE LIVES IN FEAR THAT THAT BURGER IS GOING TO BE IN HER HOME. FEARFUL OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN IT'S A MATTER OF NOT. PREJUDICE HONEY OR DENYING A RIGHT. IT IS ABOUT JUSTICE AND HISTORICALLY PART OF JUSTICE HAS REQUIRED THE FORFEITURE OF VOTING. BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT OF CRIME ON SOCIETY AND ON INDIVIDUALS. AND FOR INDIVIDUALS PROTECT PLAY OF VIOLENT CRIME OF SEXUAL OFFENSES THERE IS NO CLOSURE. THEY LIVE WITH THAT ALL OF THEIR LIVES AND HAVE THE NIGHTMARES AND GREED EVERY BIRTHDAY THAT COMES. BUT NOW WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. VERY FEW REALLY ARE UNSUPERVISED ROLAND UNDER WHICH YOU CAN JUST CALL CONDITIONAL PAROLE AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE CONDITIONS. AND EVEN GET NOW. IN SOME AREAS WERE PAROLE DOES YET EXIST. AN INDIVIDUAL BREAKS THEIR CONDITION OF FOR THEY CAN FACE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING RE INCARCERATION. WHAT COULD BE THOSE CONSEQUENCES ONE WHO HAS COMMITTED A VIOLENT CRIME. AND STILL HAS POSSESSION. OF A WEAPON. OR MANY WEAPONS. THAT COULD GET THEM BUT BACK IN CUSTODY. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NOW. IN ADDITION WE'RE GOING TO REWARD THEM. BY A RAPID RETURN TO THEIR VOTING RIGHTS. SIMPLY HAVING SERVED YOUR TIME IN CUSTODY DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR TIME. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN UNTIL YOU ARE OFFICIALLY DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE. AND THAT'S THE TIME WHAT WE NEED TO PROTECT FOR THE VICTIMS AND FOR SOCIETY TO ENSURE THE JUST DESSERTS. OUR ACCOMPLISHED. AND THE TREND HERE TODAY. IS VERY MUCH IN A DIFFERENT WAY. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED THEY'RE NOT LEGIONS OF VICTIMS CALLING IN IN OPPOSITION. BECAUSE VICTIMS OF CRIME SO DEMORALIZED NOW. PHIL CUT OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR SUFFERING UNDER THE AND JUSTICE THEY'VE GIVEN UP. THEY NEED TO HAVE A FULL. A VOICE. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES ONCE THEY HAVE EXTINGUISHED THEIR JUST DESSERTS. THEY CAN MOST OF THEM. RETURN TO BEING VOTING AND PARTICIPATING CITIZENS. BUT THAT SAID I WILL SIMPLY. THANK YOU SENATOR WILSON ANYONE ELSE WISH TO COMMENT OR HAVE A QUESTION- ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARTY OF- WELL pCHAIR YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST SACRED THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON OUR DEMOCRACY IN OUR GOVERNMENT VOTING VOTING RIGHTS BUT THIS IS ONE WHERE WE DON'T MAKE THE CHOICE HERE TODAY. EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE WE GO TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND ASK THEM TO WEIGH IN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE DOING HERE THIS MORNING TO AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW NATIONS IN THE WORLD THEY RESTRICT BOATING RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THERE'S EVEN ONE STATE IN OUR NATION WERE YOU CAN VOTE FOR PRISON. WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WHAT. A BUNCH OF STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE. REPUBLICAN STATE AND DEMOCRATS STATES. THIS IS. MARK FOR PUBLIC SAFETY WE KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ROUTE. RE INTEGRATED INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE MORE LIKELY. TO DO WELL AND NOT- BACK TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THREE NO IT'S GOOD FOR RECIDIVISM. WE ALSO KNOW THIS IS MARK FOR DEMOCRACY AS WELL EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A VOICE. I WITH THAT ASK YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. ALL RIGHT OF IS THERE A MOTION. SENATOR LEYVA MOVES SHE WAS HERE LONGER- X.
