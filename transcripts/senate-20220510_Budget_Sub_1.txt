THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT ESTABLISHED THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM WHICH SET ASIDE TWO BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD TO ESTABLISH A LOW COST STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE PAST PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING.

THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THE PLANNED TWO BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. THANK. YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY- DO QUESTIONS AFTER. EVERYONE HAS SPOKEN NEXT WE'LL GO TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. HE'S IN CONSTANT TO ROGELIO. WHEN WE REVIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECOMMENDED LAST AROUND ONE PROJECTS THAT LIST APPEARED REASONABLE TO US ON THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION USED GENERALLY ALIGNS WITH THE STATUTORY GUIDANCE. WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO IT TOO- ISSUE ROUND ONE GRANTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATURE RIGHT GUIDANCE IS RATHER BROAD. AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN WEIGHING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AGAINST THE US DEPARTMENT FINANCES RECOMMENDED LESS. AND TERMINATE SHOULD PRODUCE OUR BEST ALIGNS WITH ITS OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- FROM US YOU'LL HEAR THEM FROM THE SEGMENTS WELL WE GIVE OUR OWN SET OF- ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES BEGINNING ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. BUT IN REVIEWING ALL THESE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES WE THINK A GOOD STARTING POINT IS AGAIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM ARE- IN OUR VIEW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES APPROACH REALLY EMPHASIZES COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. AND IF THAT IS THE LEAD THE LEGISLATURE FUNDAMENTAL- OBJECTIVE HERE THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS RECOMMENDED LAST IS A REASONABLE STARTING POINT. THAT'S IT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS BROADER OBJECTIVES SUCH AS AN EXPANDING A MOMENT CAPACITY OR- PROVIDING RELIEF TO AREAS THAT HAVE PARTICULARLY TIGHT HOT HOUSING MARKETS. THAT COULD WARRANT MORE- SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATIONS THE LAST THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHATEVER PROJECTS ARE SELECTED FOR ROUND ONE. WILL COME WITH THE RISK OF. EXPERIENCING COST OVERRUNS AND THEREFORE. ACTUALLY CHANGES IN THEIR PROPOSED SCOPE FOR AFFORDABLE RENTS. AND HELP MITIGATE THOSE RISKS WELL WE RECOMMEND OF THREE CHANGES TO THEIR PROGRAMS EXISTING STATUTE. OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS START ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA BUT THEY GENERALLY FOCUS ON- SETTING ASIDE FUNDS FOR PROJECT CONTINGENCY. WE FOCUS ON ESTABLISHING A NOTIFICATION PROJECT PROCESS WHEN THERE IS A NOTABLE CHANGE IN A PROJECTS- SCOPING COSTS. AND ALSO- RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND STRENGTHENING SOME OF THE EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS LAID ON STATUTE. ASSEMBLY I WANTED TO KNOW- ONE QUICK- ADDITION- TO THIS PROGRAM PROPOSED UNDER THE SENATE OF DEMOCRAT BUDGET PLAN. UNDER THE SUN SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN- THIS OF PROGRAMS YOU REQUIRE WOULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. BRINGING THE TOTAL APPROPRIATION FOR THIS PROGRAM TO THREE AND A HALF THEN. THE ADDITIONAL ONE AND A HALF BILLION WOULD BE ALLOCATED EVENLY ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS SO THAT WOULD BE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EACH TO UCCS. COLLEGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVED OF THREE SEGMENTS WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. MMHM GOOD MORNING CHAIR LAYERED. AND A SENATOR- MEN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M SAY OVER TEN REPRESENTING TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VIEW STUDENT HOUSING IS A KEY COMPONENT OF AN AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALLOWS STUDENTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. THE AVAILABILITY OF CAMPUS HOUSING PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH OPTIONS OF WHERE TO LIVE. AND ADDITIONALLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS FOUND A LINK BETWEEN STUDENT RETENTION AND THE AVAILABLE THE OF CAMPUS HOUSING FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS. AS MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED IN HIGH COST RENTAL MARKETS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE UNIVERSITY LAUNCHED THE STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE. TO EXPAND CAMPUS HOUSING CAPACITY THE INITIATIVE AIMS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE CAMPUS HOUSING BEDS BY TWENTY TWENTY. THE INITIATIVE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND BY FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE EXCEEDED THE TARGET TO PROVIDE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND NEW FENCE AS MEASURED FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN. CAMPUSES ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT HOUSING AND CONSTRUCT AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW STUDENT HOUSING BEDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WILL PROVIDE STATE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. THESE GRANT FUNDS WILL ASSIST IN KEEPING PROJECT THAT TO A MINIMUM AND OFFERING MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CAMPUS HOUSING OPTIONS. THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE FIRST APPLICATIONS WERE DUE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST DESPITE THIS TIGHT TURNAROUND SIX UC CAMPUSES APPLY FOR FUNDING THE SIX PROJECTS REQUESTED A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE TO CONSTRUCT. OVER THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NEW STUDENT BEDS. WHEN SENDING THESE PROJECT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UNIVERSITY RANKED THEM BASED ON STATE COSTS FOR BAD. I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE REVIEW OF THESE PROJECTS AND REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PROJECTS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED. THESE INCLUDE THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR UCLA TO CONSTRUCT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT BEDS THE PROJECT WILL HAVE A CAMPUS MATCH OF TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION. AND THE ANTICIPATED OCCUPANCY WOULD BE FALL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR UC SAN DIEGO TO CONSTRUCT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHT TRANSFER STUDENT BEDS. THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE A CAMPUS MATCH OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. AND YOU ANTICIPATED OCCUPANCY WOULD BE FALL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND IN ADDITION UC MERCED JOINTLY WITH MERCED COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVED A PLANNING GRANT FOR FIVE HUNDRED. SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATE FOR PROPOSING TO ACCELERATE THE FUNDING FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. BY FUNDING MORE PROJECTS NOW THE SENATE WILL HELP KEEP INFLATION DRONE PROJECT COSTS DOWN AND ENSURE THAT NEW STUDENT HOUSING IS AVAILABLE A YEAR OR MORE SOONER. THAN UNDER THE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THREE YEAR FUNDING PLAN. BY STATUTE UC'S ELIGIBLE 420% OF THE GRANT. PROGRAM FUNDS WHICH UNDER THE SENATE LAND OF THREE PER FIVE. WOOD TOTALS HUNDRED MILLION FOR YOU SEE. AS YOU CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS THE FUN TO UNIVERSITY REQUEST THAT CAMPUSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FOUND INELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING. BE ALLOWED TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS WE WOULD ALSO LIKE FOR CAMPUSES THAT MISSED THE LAST APPLICATION CYCLE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS. IN ADDITION WE REQUEST THAT YOU RECONSIDER THE MAXIMUM RENT ALLOWED FORMULA. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY UP ONE THIRD OF ONE HALF OF THE MEDIAN INCOME IS SO LOW IN LOW INCOME AREAS AS NOT TO COVER THE COST OF CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE FOR THE FACILITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU. ARE WILL MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING SENATOR LAYER TO MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING WE ARE VERY GLAD TO SEE THE SENATE PRIORITIES INCLUDE AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR A MORE GRANTS FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. THE CALIFORNIA COMING COLLEGES ALONG WITH MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE SUPPORT- FULL FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSED END ELIGIBLE PROJECTS FUNDING FOR A PROPOSED AN ELIGIBLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO YOU WHEN- MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AVAILABLE STUDENT HOUSING ACROSS OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES- ACROSS THESE PROJECTS WE SEE A COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABILITY. AND ON THE COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABILITY IS KEY TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS A NEW INTO THE HOUSING SPACE AND MANY COLLEGES ARE BUILDING THIS CAPACITY- BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT. THE BILL THIS CAPACITY IT'S FOR PURPOSES OF ADDRESSING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THE NEED THAT WE SEE GROWING ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES ON WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS IS ON THE RISE SPACE NEEDS ARE ALSO ON THE RISE AND HOUSING IS AN INTENTIONAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THOSE. IN TANDEM WITH OTHER EFFORTS TO INCREASE CAL GRANT AND OTHER KEY RESOURCES THAT HIDE WITH AFFECTED STUDENTS SUPPORTS AND A COMMITMENT TO SUCCESS IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE REPEATING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OR CALIFORNIA AND REACHING THE PROPOSED 70% GOAL OF ADULTS EARNING DEGREES OR CREDENTIALS. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE PROJECTS SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND ELIGIBLE- IN ON THIS YEAR'S GRANTS ARE ONES THAT ARE IN FIREAFFECTED AREAS. THREE AND FACTOR FROM FIRE AFFECTED AREAS WHERE NOT ONLY HAVE HOUSING COSTS REASON. THEY'VE ALSO- IN OF. THE ACT THE HARD OR DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE TO CONSTRUCT AND THEREFORETHAT TENDS TO DRIVE COSTS FOR STUDENTS. MANY OF THESE PROJECTS THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU ARE IN REGIONS WHERE IT THE RENTAL COSTS ARE ANYWHERE FROM. NINETEEN HUNDRED TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A ONE BEDROOM MAKING IT UNAFFORDABLE FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE SKIN HOUSING THE CALIFORNIA COMING COLLEGES HAS LAUNCHED A TASK FORCE TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE ADDRESS REGULATION CHANGES COLLECTED DATA NECESSARY SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THESE COLLEGES. AS THE BUILT IN THIS NEW STRATEGY IN THESE PROGRAMS LOCALLY SO THEY CAN BE PER ARE SUPPORTED WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND HE SUPPORT INTO THAT ARE REGULATIONS ALSO ALIGNED WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONCE THE CAKE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME NOTE FOR THE RECORD WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY SENATOR JOE BOB WE HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE LAST OF THE PRESENTERS ON ISSUE TWENTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EAST. GET YOUR LETTER GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS FIVE SEVEN ONE IN THE SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGNING CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. SINCE YOU SUBMITTED TO COMMITTEE STAFF THE FUNDING REQUEST FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM. ALONG WITH PROPOSED TRAILER BILL REVISIONS THE- FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THE CSU ATHLETIC THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE FUNDING. OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. FOR THE FIRST TWO OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR MULTI YOUR BILL. SO IF THE SENATE IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORLD TO WORK PROGRAM WE NEED TO BE HAPPY JUST SUBMIT AN ADDITIONAL CYCLE PROJECTS. CAN SAY THIS FALL. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION PROJECTS IS COMPRISED OF SPENDING FOR SEVEN NEW PROJECTS AND FIFTY MILLION TO BEGIN THE DIRECT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE PROJECT FUNDING REQUESTS THE PROJECTS INCLUDE TO RECOMMENDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO WITH FIVE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE. BUT BASED ON THE TRUSTEES PRIORITIES. ACROSS THE SEVEN PROJECTS THE CSU PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AFFORDABLE BEST INCREASED CAPACITY. TO COPE FUND PROJECTS USING CSU BOND FINANCING OF TWO HUNDRED SIX MILLION. THE CSU CO FUNDING. THE COST PER BED TO THE STATE BY ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED. AND HELPS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BELOW MARKET RATE THAT STORE STUDENTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INTER SEGMENTAL PROJECT WITHIN PRIVILEGED COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE PROPOSED 65% STATE GRANT FUNDS AND 35% CSU CO FOUNDING. THE LA- IS CORRECT THAT THESE PROJECTS COME WITH RISKS IN EXTREME CONSTRUCTION COST ESCALATION. IS AN ONGOING CONCERN. THE SENATE'S WEALTH TO WORK PROPOSAL TO INCREASE PROGRAM SPENDING IS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE SEGMENTS TO DELIVER THE PROJECT GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED ESCALATION IT CONTINUES. THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL COULD BE FASHION TO INCLUDING NOTICE PROVISION OR FOR THE SPOKE WITH BUDGET CHANGE BUT ALSO ENABLE THE CSU TO MANAGE ESCALATION WITH IT WITHIN ITS TARGETED EMAIL. WHICH IS CURRENTLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION. THAT COULD INCREASE ONE POINT ONE BILL WITH THE SAN PROPOSE. FOR THE PROJECT PURCHASE STATION IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS CONSIDERED BY PARTNERS FINANCES CSU ALSO CONSIDERED PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE CONSTRUCTION START DATE AND THE AMOUNT OF EXISTING BEDS FOR CAMPUS. FRESNO STATE FOR EXAMPLE HAS ONLY 5% OF BETS TO SERVICE STUDENT POPULATION. GIVEN THE DESIRED START DATE IN THE STATUTE IN THE STATUTE OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWO. CSU HAS STARTED THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR DESIGNING CONSTRUCTION FOR A NUMBER OF THE PRIORITY PROJECTS AND YOUR SUPPORT WOULD ENABLE THESE PROJECTS TO CONTINUE AT PACE. FOR SUGGESTIONS GOING FORWARD TO SEE IF YOU PROPOSES THE STATUTE BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE. FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW FOR RENOVATIONS WHERE WE CAN INCREASE THE DENSITY GOING FROM TWO BEDS IN A ROOM TO THREE BEDS THAT WILL REDUCE THE COST PREVENT VERSUS NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND AN IDEA THAT WOULD PERMIT CSU TO USE HER AS A PART OF ITS TARGETED FUNDS PROVIDE HOUSING GRANTS DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS IF ALLOWED THE RENOVATION PROJECTS COULD BE SUBMITTED. FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE THIRD YEAR PRO OF THE PROGRAM. IN THE GRANT DOLLARS BE USED TO ADDRESS STATE FARM MARSHALL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING FIRE SPRINKLERS FIRE ALARMS. BUT ALSO OTHER UPGRADES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED BY CODE. SO PROJECTS THAT WOULD INCREASE DENSITY MCCARTY USE FOR CSU SHOULD THE RENOVATIONS BE ALLOWED. THE SECOND REQUESTING TO THE STATUTE WOULD ALLOW PORTION OF THE FUNDS BE USED FOR A- DIRECT GRANT TO STUDENTS THAT WOULD REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING. THE CSU ASKED FOR FIFTY MILLION BE APPROVED EFFECTIVE SO THE BEDS COULD BE OFFERED AVAILABLE BEDS COULD BE OFFERED TO LOOK IN STUDENTS AT THE RATE DEFINED IN THE STATUTE. THE CSU WOULD SET UP TYPE OF IN DOWN MEANT TO USE THE FUNDS OVER TIME WITH TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS BE THE GOAL THEN WE WOULD USE THE AMOUNT OF. PROCEEDS AND EARNED BY THE INVESTMENT TO. SUBSIDIZE THE COST TO LOOKING STUDENTS THE PROJECT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MATTER OF MONTHS VERSES ROUGHLY THREE TO FOUR YEARS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. THIS APPROACH WOULD CRITICS WIDGET NOT EXPOSE THE PROGRAM TO BE CONTINUED CONSTRUCTION COST ESCALATION AS A CAMPUSES WITH AVAILABLE BEDS COULD PURCHASE MADE IMMEDIATELY SO IT'S FASTER. IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF PORTABLE HOUSING SUPPORTS IT RENDITION OF BALANCES OUT THE BILL ABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY SO IN SUMMARY THE CSU REQUEST IS FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION OR COMBINATION PROJECTS AND A NEW DIRECT STUDENT GRANT SUBSIDY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE GATHERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU THAT COMPLETES OUR FIVE PRESENTATIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE COMMITTEE. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. AND LET ME BEGIN. OF BY JUST MAKING A COUPLE OF COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY- OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR FOR THIS PURPOSE OVER THREE YEARS WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED AND- INDICATED A DRAMATIC NEED. AND SO THAT IS WHY. OF THERE HAS BEEN A PROPOSAL FROM- THE SENATE MAJORITY TO ADD ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ODD TO TRY. TO ADDRESS THAT NEED. IS WHAT WE ARE HERE TODAY- SECOND. I KNOW THAT PROBE WAS REALLY QUICKLY BY THE- AFTER IT WAS APPROVED AND THAT DID NOT BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE. AND I THINK OCCASIONALLY THERE WERE SOME THINGS LOST IN THE TRANSLATION AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THE GRANTS WENT OUT. IT WAS NOT MADE CLEAR THAT. HE LANDING IN CONSTRUCTION GRANTS TOGETHER FOR THE SAME PROJECT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO NEARBY I KNOW IT WAS ONE PLACE IN MY DISTRICT DID THAT DID THEY WERE REALLY DISAPPOINTED. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T LAID OUT IN ADVANCE WITH CLARITY AND SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE. THAT IT'S GOOD TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS FROM THE APPLICANTS SO THAT THEY CAN RESPOND IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. AND- THEN. LET ME MOVE TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BEFORE I GO TO MY COLLEAGUES AND THE FIRST ONE IS- TO THE THREE BRANCHES- WE HEARD IN THE PRESENTATION AND IN A MORE DETAILED WRITTEN PRESENTATION AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S RESPONDED TO THIS PROGRAM. WEST OF THREE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT OTHER FEEDBACK I WOULD ASK. EACH OF THE BRANCHES IF THEY WOULD RESPOND TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ANALYSIS WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT IT AND LET'S GO ON THE SAME ORDER THAT THE PRESENTATION WAS SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER LETTERED- THE L. A. O. WHO HAD. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO HAVE THE OF INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE A CONTINGENCY FUND FROM NON STATE FUNDS. OF WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN WE CAN BUILD THAT INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS. FOR ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES THAT RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER DISCREPANCIES SO THEY ARE PREPARED TO GUARANTEE- OF 10% CONTINGENCY OR SOME AMOUNT OF CONTINGENCY FROM NONSTATE FUNDS TOWARD THE PROJECT- THIS MAY BE NECESSARY RIGHT NOW AS OUR INFLATION IS DRIVING UP CONSTRUCTION COSTS QUITE RAPIDLY- AND IT OFTEN TAKES OVER YEAR. TO CONSTRUCT ONE OF THESE PROJECTS SO- VERY LIKELY WE WILL SEE COST ESCALATION EVEN ASK CONSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING. THEN THE L. A. O.'S- OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS OF ME- SO IN TERMS OF HAVING DE UM LEGISLATURE WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE BEDS IN THE PROJECT I THINK THAT IS COMPLETELY REASONABLE- WE DO WANT TO CAUTION YOU AGAINST HAVING THE INSTITUTION COME BACK FOR NEEDING TO USE MORE OF NEEDING TO USE SOME OF THE CONTINGENCY FUNDS. OF THAT THEY WILL PUT FORWARD BECAUSE OF THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO OCCUR AND THE THIRTY DAY NOTICE WILL CAUSE ADDITIONAL DELAYS IN THE PROJECT- IN ORDER TO HAVE A STUDENT HOUSING PROJECT SERVE THE MOST STUDENTS IT REALLY NEEDS TO OPEN IN THE FALL SO WE CAN FULLY FILLED OUT PROJECT- AND ANY KIND OF DELAYS COULD PUSH THAT OPENING DATE BACK SO WE WANT TO JUST CAUTION YOU ABOUT. THE COST OVERRUNS AND HOW FREQUENTLY A CAMPUS WOULD NEED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MORNING AGAIN WAS THAT NUMBER AT- SECTOR MY SCENES WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHEN WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY POINTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MENTIONED THE FIRST ALL TALK ABOUT AND REYES RELATED TO DATA- AND THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THESE PROJECTS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SOME IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS IS UNDERTAKING EXTENSIVE WORK TO INTEGRATE HOUSING PROJECTS- AND HOUSING PLANS INTO PLATFORM WE HAVE A COLD FUSION SO THAT WE HAVE DATA ACCESSIBLE TO USE SO THAT YOU CAN MONITOR PROGRESS. AND WE CAN- ENSURING THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ELEMENTS WILL ALSO- WE'RE INTEGRATING A LOOKING AT TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROJECTS HAVE LONG TERM QUALITY AND CAN BE SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF COSTS. AND WE KNOW THAT BUILDING IS NOT THE ONLY COSTS THE COLLEGES ARE COMMITTING TO IT'S REALLY UP HE AND THE SERVICES AND HE SUPPORTS THAT ARE OFFERED TO STUDENTS THAT ARE VALUABLE SO WE DO THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. AND THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE IS READY TO SUPPORT NETWORK- WITHIN THE- LAST OVER RUN ON BREAKING. THAT THE- PRICE YOU. INCLUDE PERCENT CUSTOMER RENDON DO THINK THAT- CONSIDERING A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THAT IS IMPORTANT- AND THEN AND HOLDING THE LINE THERE SO THAT COLLEGES ARE COMMITTED AND- CAN PROVE THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN THIS AGAIN. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT JUST THE COSTS NOW BUT THERE ARE LONG TERM- ABILITY TO AFFORD THESE PROJECTS. WITH REGARDS TO GENERAL AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF SETTING RENTS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- IS PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO COLLEGES- AND HOW TO DECIDE WHO- AND PROVIDING SOME TEMPLATE ON HOW TO DECIDE. WHO TO- PROVIDE HOUSING TO GIVEN THAT EVEN LOCALLY- SOME OF THE SOUND BEDS WILL BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AS ONE OF THE FACTORS THIS LOOKS I- AFFORDABILITY MEASURES THAT ARE MORE IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE FINANCIAL AID DATA THAT COLLEGES. COLLECTED LOCALLY SO THAT THOSE SOME OF THE KEY PIECES THAT REALLY STAND OUT TO US I'M FROM THE ALLEY ANALYSIS HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAILS THERE ARE OTHER SPECIFIC ONES THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE ON. TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. IT THE UC AN MANY COLLEGE IN THE A. O. RECOGNIZE THE- AS. ALSO THE BENEFITS. WE BUILT IN A 5% ESCALATION FOR US PER YEAR GOING OUT TO THE MIDPOINT AND WE'VE HAD 10% ESCALATION IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALONE SO WE'RE WE'RE RAN ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS IF NOT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAT IS A CONCERN AND I THINK THE ALEJO'S FORTY DONE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ON HOW THE PROGRAM IS DEVELOPED AS WE GO FORWARD IS ALSO KEY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THE BILL THE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MOLD A PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS IS NOTED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN STILL HAVE UNMET FINANCIAL NEED SO WE'RE PROPOSING A PROCESS WHERE WITH THIS GRANT WE COULD HIT A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND NOT JUST LIMITED TO SEVEN EIGHT NINE CAMPUSES SO WE ARE EXPECTING CAMPUS HOUSING PLANS TO COME IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO THERE DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE JULY FIRST AND SO HAVING. SOME DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY HOUSING AND LOW INCOME HOUSING WILL BE REALLY VERY VERY BENEFICIAL TO SUPPORT THEIR HOUSING PLANTS THE OTHER ITEM ON ITEM VETO PAGE EIGHTEEN IS JUST LIKE YOUR FACIAL. ISSUES ON ACADEMIC PROJECTS SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S BEEN INCREASED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL FUNDING FOR A PROPOSED IN THE SENATE PLAN- SEVENTY THREE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW LET ME. ASK OF THE DEPART OF FINE IN THE LEAD. AND WHO REESE. TO THE COMMENTS. OF THE THREE SEGMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAID THAT ONE PARTICULAR METRIC WAS SO LOW THAT THEY COULDN'T DO. MAINTENANCE AND ONGOING COSTS BECAUSE OF THAT METRIC AND THAT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- ASKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE GRANT PROGRAM AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT WE HAVE THREADED THE NEEDLE HERE BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDS AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR ON GOING FUNDS TO SUPPORT A ONE TIME FUND ALLOCATION OF FOR HOUSING. BUT LET'S ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS TO RESPOND TO ANYTHING THEY HEARD FROM THIS THREE SEGMENTS BUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN PARTICULAR TO THOSE TWO SPECIFIC CONCERNS. AND LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A DIFFICULT- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO TO SPEAK- TO THE UC'S OF COMMENTS ON THE RENT- OUR MAIN GOAL WITH THIS PROPOSAL WAS TO REALLY PROVIDE THE LOWEST MOST AFFORDABLE RENT TO STUDENTS- AND WE'VE FOUND THROUGH THE UC'S APPLICATIONS THAT- AT LEAST TO THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE REVIEWED AND THEY SUBMITTED- THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE- MAINTENANCE TO THEIR FACILITY SEEP THROUGH THE RENT THAT THEY HAVE. TO THE RIGHT THAT WE PROPOSE AND THEY HAVE PROPOSED IN THEIR APPLICATIONS- SO- AND THEN IN TERMS OF WE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO ANY- FUTURE PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME AND AS WE HAVEN'T REVIEWED WE HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO REVIEW THAT SO I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON ANY ONGOING FUNDING OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SPENDING AT THIS TIME- SO YEAH. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THE OF THE CSU. ON GOING PROPOSAL AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY SAID IN RESPONSE TO THE OHIO. THAT'S TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO AT THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T REVIEWED ANY PROPOSALS THAT THAT THE CSU HAS WE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK ON ANY PROPOSALS THAT THE CSU HAS SUBMITTED TO US- CAN YOU. BE MORE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF- WHAT WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SAID OUT. HERE HERE YOU CAN'T RESPOND TO THE CSU WON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SET OUT THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOUSING PROGRAM IN THE THREE BRANCHES JUST RESPONDED AND I'M ASKING IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND. TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON THOSE THREE DIFFERENT THINGS OR ANYTHING THAT THE BRANCHES SAID. WITH THEIR RESPONSE TO. YEAH SO- TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ON THE CASE THE POINT OF THE CONTINGENCY WE ACTUALLY DID PROVIDE A 10% CONTINGENCY TO ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN FOR THE FROM THE UC IN THE CSU THEY DID BUILT IN A 5% CONTINGENCY. INTO EACH OF THEIR PROJECT PROPOSALS- SO THAT THAT'S FOR ONE AND THEN ADDITIONALLY JUST% TO KIND OF GO INTO OUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE. SELECTED PROJECTS AS WE REALLY FOLLOWED- WHAT WAS REQUIRED IN STATUTE- YOUKNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIRED FRANK ACOSTA- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW CERTAIN STUDENT METRICS OUR REQUIRED- AND THEN WE KIND OF WE WEEDED OUT PROJECTS BASED ON THAT INITIALLY AND THEN WE WENT INTO RANKING PROJECTS BASED ON. THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS WHICH WAS REALLY AN EFFICIENCY METRICS AS WELL AS THE STUDENT RIGHT COST WHICH WAS- IN AFFORDABILITY METRICS- AND THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO. TO RANK PROJECTS AGAINST EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MORE UNIVERSAL AND METRIC THAT COULD BE COMPATIBLE AGAINST DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND I WAS REALLY OUR THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND- WHAT WHAT WE PUT FORWARD. TO THE LEGISLATURE- AND HAPPY DANCE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU LET ME ASK. THE L. A. O. IF IN THIS ROUND ROBIN YOU HAVE BEEN THE LAST COMMENT ON WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SURE SO- I YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN RELEASED- ANYTHING'S ARE ANY ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY ON- A LOT OF THAT POINTS THAT WERE RAISED HERE SO- YOU KNOW WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF IN THE COMING WEEKS ON ANY ITEMS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ON THE USED TO COMMENT ON THE STATURE RANCH IS A BIG LEAP. FROM IN OUR ANALYSIS WE RAISED- SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER AROUND THE PROPOSED STATUTORY RENTS- OUR- OUR POINT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW THE STATUTORY WRENCH THAT THAT MEASURE. 30% OR 50% OF ANY AREAS NEEDING INCOME. AS A COMMON MEASURE USED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. WITHIN THE COLLEGE CONTEXT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE. THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF STUDENTS PARTICULARLY AT UC AND CSU. ARE IT DEPENDENCE AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS ARE ALREADY SPENDING A PORTION OF THEIR INCOME. ON THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND SO THEY LIKELY COULD NOT IN CONCEPTS ALSO DEVOTING ADDITIONAL 30% OF THEIR ANNUAL INCOME TO SUPPORT HOUSING FOR THEIR COLLEGE STUDENT. INTERNALLY SPEAKING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT FINANCIAL AID IS VERY DIFFERENT IT OFTEN SEEMS STUDENTS AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD SAVE MONEY OVER TIME WORK PART TIME. IT'S BASED ON THE SORT OF EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AND FINANCIAL NEED. AND SO WE DID ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE OVER THE COMING YEARS TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO SORT OF INTEGRATE FINANCIAL AID. AND STUDENT HOUSING COSTS AS IT AS A SORT OF PROCEDURES PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD- AS IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES OF. UP ON START HAVING A SEPARATE PROGRAM SUSPENDED US ALL. WITH ALL. PROPOSALS IN THE EVEN TO SOME SOME MENTAL AND ON ON ITS CAN WE BE TO WORK STAFF ON THAT- THERE'S OF THOSE ITEMS OF. INTEREST I'M FINALLY I DID HEAR SOME- POINTS AROUND WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH INVOLVES- THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND JUST INSURING WHAT'S NOT. YOUR TO ARRESTS FOR PROJECTS AND- ON SOME OF THOSE THEM THE FEEDBACK SOUNDS REASONABLE I THINK THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN STRUCTURE THE REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT JUST SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I IN OUR ANALYSIS WE RECOMMENDED. SETTING AND- SORT OF MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF LIKE 10% OF THE PROJECT CHANGE SO THAT. REALLY MINOR CHANGES DON'T REQUIRE OF YOUR NOTIFICATION I THINK I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION THAT'S ABOUT IT THE JUSTICE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. RAISED THANK YOU MANAHAN FROM C. REPRESENTATIVE DO YOU A COMMENT YOU WANT ME. THANK YOU CAN I JUST WANTED CLARIFY THAT WE SPEAKING CONGO BECAUSE FOR FROM WE WOULD ARE ABOUT A PORTION OF THE GRANT FUNDS THAT ARE IS INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION. THAT WE WOULD SET ASIDE AS AN ENDOWMENT AND IT WOULD BE THE EARNINGS FROM THE CORPUS OF THAT. OF THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WE WOULD USE TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING COSTS FOR STUDENTS IN SO THAT WE WOULD HOPE TO SPEND LESS THAN THE INTEREST EARNINGS ON ANNUAL BASIS SO WE WOULD KEEP THE CORPUS INTACT OVER TIME. IS THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARMANI GO TO MY COLLEAGUES. SORRY THAT WE HAD THIS ANIMATED DISCUSSION START WITH SENATOR MEN AND THEN. THANK YOU CHAIRED AT APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION HERE AND YOU KNOW I REPRESENT UC IRVINE AND A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES I MY DISTRICT- I AM ALWAYS DISTURBED TO HEAR ABOUT THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HOUSING IN SECURE AND HOMELESS STUDENTS. OBVIOUSLY IT IS DIFFICULT EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO DO WELL ACADEMICALLY IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER TO SLEEP ANY GIVEN NIGHT- SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT BOTH THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION ARE PRIORITIZING THE CONSTRUCTION OF STUDENT HOUSING HERE- BUT I DO HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. FIRST I GUESS I WANTED TO. DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT I GUESS THIS QUESTION IS FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE L. A- AND ALSO THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS BUT- TO WHAT DEGREE IS THIS AN ISSUE OF A LACK OF LOW INCOME OR LOWER COST HOUSING THESE OF THE JUST. OVERALL HOUSING SUPPLY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD YEAH I MEAN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE. BOTH A LACK OF SUPPLY ANY LACK OF LOWER COST SUPPLY. I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW IS THERE SOME STUDENTS THEY AND I PLACES LIKE UC IRVINE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT CAN CERTAINLY AFFORD TO PAY FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING. ARE THERE SOME STUDENTS THAT YOU DON'T NEED SOME HELP AND THEY NEED LOWER INCOME OR LOWER COST HOUSING AND I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF IF WE'VE- ANALYZED THIS ISSUE. AND WHAT DEGREE E. INTO THIS IS. THIS THE SAME FROM ARE FACING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THERE'S BOTH A LACK OF SUPPLY. AND A LACK OF SUPPLY FOR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND AGAIN TRYING TO GET THAT SENSE SO IF YOU HAVE. ANY COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS I'D APPRECIATE HEARING SO I THINK- I THINK YOU RAISE A KIND OF KEY CONSIDERING FOR THE LARGEST WHICH YOU KNOW WHETHER TO FOLK ON SORT OF OVER HOUSING FOR COLLEGE OR WHETHER THE FOCUS BE MORE ON THE FOR. AND OVERALL CULTURE FOR AND AFFORDABILITY IN FOR TWO- YOU KNOW CONSENT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IN PROVIDING STATE FUNDING FOR HOUSING PROJECTS ARGUABLY IS. ON AFFORDABILITY THAT'S BECAUSE CAMPUSES HAVE LONG BEEN IT WAS PARTICULARLY AT UC INTO ME AND THE CSU SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HOUSING PROJECTS FROM HOUSING FEE REVENUE AND SO CONCEPTUALLY THE AYE THE ADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING STATE FUNDING IS TO MAKE THESE AND IT'S MORE AFFORDABLE. SUMMARIZING A PORTION OF THE COSTS HOSTER THAT THEY ARE INTENDED RENTS CAN BE LOWER THAN THE OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS. ONLY WE DID LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN THE FALL AND THEN WE GENERALLY HEARD FROM CAMPUSES THAT MANY OF THEM WERE. ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A STUDENT HOUSING THAT FROM STUDENT FEE REVENUE OVER TIME. AND SO AGAIN THAT THAT SEEM TO SUGGEST AT LEAST THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY A FUNDING ISSUE IN TERMS OF INCREASING OVERALL HOUSING SUPPLY. YOU KNOW THAT'S A THERE ARE CASES WHERE CAMPUSES DO-EXPERIENCES INSTANCE INSTANCES WHERE THERE CAN BE SIR TIGHTER HOUSING THE NORMAL- WE'VE HEARD THAT AND I DON'T WE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UC MERCED CAMPUS. AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO CASES WHERE- YOU KNOW CAMPUS IS A MOMENT. IT'S PAST THREE CAN ALSO BE LIMITED BASED ON HOUSING CAPACITY THAT RECENTLY CAME UP WITH UC BERKELEY- THAT CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATURE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT ARE YOU KNOW AT LEAST. FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIMARY VANTAGE OF PROVIDING A STATE SUBSIDY FOR THIS PROJECT IS TO MAKE THEM MORE AFFORDABLE. THANK YOU- BERMAN FINANCE. JENNIFER FINANCE- YEAH WE YOU KNOW THERE IS A BROADER- STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS AND WE HAVE HEARD THROUGH VARIOUS LEGISLATION ANECDOTALLY FROM. YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES THAT THEIR STUDENTS ARE GOING ON HOUSE OR LIVING IN CARS- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL REALLY AIMS TO ADDRESS ACTUALLY BOTH OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED. WHICH IS INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING AT THESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT BECAUSE THE RENT IS CAPPED- TO PROVIDE THE MOST AFFORDABLE RENT TO STUDENTS. GOT IN AND I ASISTIR BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE OR OR IN GRAD SCHOOL- BUT MY SENSE WAS. AT THE TIME AND I WAS NOT- IF SOMEONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I- YOU KNOW IT MY SENSE WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CROSS SUBSIDY HAPPENING AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN EMPHASIZE MORE AND I GUESS THIS CASE LA WAS POINT ABOUT- ROLLING UP. FINANCIAL AID INTO HOUSING BUT- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS BASED ON THEIR INCOME AND NEED GOT DIFFERENT PACKAGES- SOME FOLKS WERE PAYING THE FULL. FREIGHT AND THEN INCLUDED YOU KNOW THAT COSTA HOUSING AT MARKET RATE IN AND SO IF THIS WARRANT A MATTER OF LACK OF HOUSING AND I JUST WONDER IF WE CAN RELY A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT- PARTICULARLY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND THIS GETS KIND OF TO SECOND POINT WHICH IS- DEPARTMENT FINANCE I THINK THAT GERMAN LATER DID TRY TO GET THAT THIS IS BY ASKING ABOUT YOUR- ASSESSMENT OF THE DIFFERENT. HOW ABRUPT. PER BY THE ALEJO. BUT I JUST WANTED TO ACTUALLY GET. ON ONE BECAUSE I THINK. FOR ME THIS KIND OF GETS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE. YOU RIGHT NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT EMPHASIZE THE ADMINISTRATION EMPHASIZES THE COST PER BED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE PURCHASE SUGGESTED BY THE L. A. O. IS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. THE COMPARISON OF THE COSTS PER BED VIS A VIS THE MARKET RATE OR OR- NON STUDENT HOUSING IN TE AREA AND I'M WONDERING. WHY THAT'S NOT A PREFERABLE APPROACH BECAUSE THAT MIGHT GET TO MORE OF. DAY HIGH COST AREA ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED THAT IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT. A NOMINAL FIGURE OF COST PER BED- DANNY NOT. REACHING THE PLACES WHERE WE REALLY HAVE A CRISIS AND PUT THE HIGH COST AREAS WHERE WE'RE FINDING SOMETHING THAT'S BEFORE WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING. AFFORDABLE IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT SO I WONDER IF YOU ANY COMMENTS ON THAT- YEAH- SO JUST TO CLARIFY- WE RANK USING COST PER BED ND FRIENDS- SO PROVIDING EITHER IT SUCKS UP SOME OF THE- APPLICANTS ACTUALLY- PROPOSED PROVIDING FRANK LOWER THAN ACTUALLY WHAT WE HAD. A REQUIRED IN STATUTE- AND SO THOSE PROJECTS WERE RANKED HIGHER- IS THERE PROVIDING THE MOST AFFORDABLE RENTS FOR STUDENTS- SO IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW ORIGINAL METRIC- IT WAS THAT WAS A- MORE DIFFICULT- METRIC FOR US TO EVALUATE. AND- THE LEGISLATURE IS A WELCOME TO INCLUDE THAT WITHIN THEIR OWN RECORD OF WITH THEIR OWN SPACE THAT YOU'RE THEN GOING TO APPROVED- WE BUT WE WANTED TO BE MORE. METRIC AND ADDITIONALLY IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS REQUIRED IN STATUTE THAT WE HAD PUT IN THERE- SO IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT- WE HAD INITIALLY. PROPOSED PUT IN OUR PROPOSAL IN OUR PROPOSED RECOMMENDED. AND STRUCTURE. YEAH I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY EMPHASIZE AFFORDABILITY- THAT IS A REACH AS OPPOSED TO JUST- A. N. AND WE'RE PRETTY ONLY FOR PROVIDING SOME CITY IT WAS PREGNANT. AND I HAVEN'T STUDIED THIS ISSUE AS CLOSE AS YOU ALL BUT- IS STRUCK ME THAT THE ON CAMPUS VERSUS OFF CAMPUS RENT COMPARISON. MIGHT GET- YOU TO MORE ACCURATE THAT'S ONE OF WHICH PARTICULAR CAMPUSES ARE OR BEDS NEED MORE SUBSIDIES THAN OTHERS. AND I THINK THAT WAS MAYBE THAT I DON'T TO PUT WORDS IN THE ALEJO'S MOUTH BUT THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE. ONE OF THE REASONS WE MIGHT CHOOSE THIS APPROACH AND SO MAYBE THE L. A. O. COULD COMMENT HERE'S WELL. RIGHT SO- RIGHT SO IF THEY MINISTRATION CONSIDER TWO METRICS AGAIN. A STATE COSTS FOR AFFORDABLE BAN. SO FOR ALL THE AFFORDABLE BAGS THAT WERE FILLED IN A PROJECT THEY DIVIDED THE- THE- PROPOSED ACOSTA NOT. GOT TO IT. BECAUSE FOR AFFORDABLE THAT METRIC. EXCLUDED BANDS THAT WERE- MORE STANDARD WRENCH SOME PROJECTS ARE A MIX OF AFFORDABLE RENT BEDS AND STANDARDBRED BEDS. ANOTHER IS THAT SECOND METRIC THAT COMPARED THE PROPOSED RENTS O THE STATUTORY LIMIT. AND ONE OPTION WE- RECOMMEND TH LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. IS TO COMPARE THE PROPOSED RENTS TO- COMMUNITY RENTAL RATES AND THROW OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. RATHER THAN THE STATUTORY LIMIT. AND THE PRIMARY VANTAGE WE SEE WITH THAT IS THAT IT COULD ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT. MORE PRECISE RANKING- UNDER THE- ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH YOU KNOW BECAUSE AT. LIKE HALF THE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. PROPOSED A MAXIMUM STATUTORY RENTS WE ALREADY COOLEY. AND SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR A LITTLE MORE FINE BREAKING. AYE YOU'RE ALSO CORRECT THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT DOES SORT OF. EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT SERVE PORTABILITY AND THAT- IT. REALLY COMPARES- THE PROPOSED RENTS TO. A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF WHAT. THEY'RE SORT OF ALTERNATIVE IS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT COULD BE ANOTHER GRAND OF CONSIDERING THAT TOO. AND THEN IT JUST EMPHASIZED DEPARTMENT FINANCES POINT- THAT'S- WE- WE RECEIVE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM UC AND CSU. ON THOSE ON THOSE RENTS ARE AFTER THE INITIAL. LETTER WAS SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE INFORMATION IS A BILL AVAILABLE FOR USING THIS YEAR'S YOU. THE COLLEGES ARE MORE A LITTLE BIT. MORE VARIED AND WHETHER THEY CAN. THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO REPORT. ALSO THE ABILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THAT APPROACH FOR THE COLLEGES MIGHT BE ONE BUT IF. THANK YOU MISTER I WOULD JUST- ARTICULATE MY OWN PREFERENCE- AND I DON'T THAT SHARED BY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT- IF WE'RE- TO EXTENT WE'RE PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING FOR HOUSING. I WOULD STRONGLY PREFER TO SEE THAT- GO ENTIRELY OR PREDOMINANTLY TOWARDS. AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS- THE ROLE AND IF IT MORE MARKET RATE. HOUSING TO BE BUILT I FEEL LIKE THAT OUGHT TO BE THE- WITHIN OTHER FROM FINE STREAMS THAT NOT FROM THIS ONE TIME- I LAST. IS I CSU RAISED POINT THAT- IF IT THE DISH OFTEN CAME. THROUGH THAT YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MORE. TO PROPOSE. I SUSPECT ALSO THE- WITH COMMUNITY. AND YOU. AND SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT OR OR DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA- HAS ANY IDEA THIS BUT- TO WHAT DEGREE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS- IT AS SOON THIS IS NOT INFINITE BUT WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR- FUNDING. NEEDS WOULD BE IF WE COULD JUST YOU KNOW WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND PROVIDE ALL THE FUNDING WE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YEAH I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF LIKE HOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS- EACH OF THE EACH OF THE DIVISIONS. AND WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO START OH SURE WHILE WHEN WE START THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING AND LISINOPRIL WHICH COMPANY COLLEGES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ONE I WANT TO REITERATE- YOUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABILITY WE THINK THAT THE STATE INVESTMENT REALLY SHOULD. GO TO SERVE OUR MOST LOW INCOME STUDENTS NOT REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS AHEAD OF US. I'M FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WE HAVE- EXTENSIVE PROJECTS. BEFORE YOU WHEN YOU CONSIDER THESE YOU'LL HAVE A TOTAL OF NINETY SEVEN APPLICATIONS. I'M THOSE ARE TWENTY FIVE ARE FOR CONSTRUCTION THE REMAINDER ARE- FOR ELEMENTS OF EITHER CONSTRUCTION AND- PLANNING. AND SO ON AS YOU'LL SEE THERE'S EXTENSIVE NEED- DAY THE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING AT SOME POINT. ON WILL ALSO BE LOOKING FOR RESOURCES FOR CONSTRUCTION SO WE DO SEE THAT OVERALL- AND THERE WILL BE EXTENSIVE NEED. I'M JUST AND- CONSTRUCTION ALONE BASED ON WHAT WE- KNOW NOW- DAY COMMUTE COLLEGE NEED IS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX. BILLION DOLLARS- WITH PLANNING WORK TO BEGIN ON ON A SEVENTY FOUR PROJECTS WHICH WOULD LATER GIVE US THAT DATA POINT OF WHAT CONSTRUCTION WOULDN'T. WOULDN'T S. NECESSITY SO IT MAY BE JUST. MAYBE TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO ME HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ASKED FOR SO FAR AND AS FAR AS DOLLARS I THINK WE HAVE A WHAT A THREE POINT SIX. DOLLAR FIGURE. AND HOW MUCH MORE WOULD YOU ASK FOR IF WE HAD MORE MONEY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANTED. IN THE END JUST BECAUSE- OF. OF OUR- MAY BE CONFUSED BY YOUR THREE POINT SIX BILLION FIGURE THAT'S ALL THREE BRANCHES TOGETHER THAT'S NOT JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE AGGREGATE YOU THE THREE BRANCHES OF S. OR THREE POINT SIX BILLION IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR SHARES YOU. HOW MUCH MORE HOW MUCH OF YOU ASKED FOR HOW MUCH WOULD YOU ADD FOR IF WE HAD MORE FUN. SURE THANK YOU TO ONE CLEAR. THESE PROJECTS WERE SUBMITTED INDIVIDUALLY BY THE LOCALLY GOVERNED DISTRICTS- SO IN TOTAL- THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES NEED IS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH. OF THE- PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONSTRUCTION AND THOSE THAT ARE IN THE PLANNING PHASE WHICH IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES. THAT WILL BE READY AT SOME POINT- AND THAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE A COST- THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT UNTIL THEY COMPLETE THEIR PLANNING. IF I CAN ASK A QUICK FOLLOW UP THAT'S A TOTALLY SELF SELECTED LIST THAT JUST IF THE INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE. DISTRICTS CHOSE TO APPLY THERE MAY BE MORE OUT THERE THEY JUST DIDN'T CHOOSE TO APPLY RIGHT NOW SO YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF SORT OF WHO SELECTED THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN SENATOR MAN YOU WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT YEAR OKAY. AND I GUESS THAT THE UPSHOT IS WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE THEN OF WHAT THE DEMAND MIGHT BE IF WE OPENED UP THE COPPERSMITH. IF YOU OPEN IT UP SO WE HAD NEARLY. YES I MEAN YEAH I JUST WANT YES OR NO REALLY SORRY. MISTER ROGERS FOR THE RECORD MISTER MAN JUST PASSED THE BAR SO HE IS MOVING TO THE LEGAL SOCRATIC METHOD THERE. WAS A CREDIT TO BE TO HAVE YOU ANSWER BUT I JUST I JUST PURPOSE IS IT YES OR NO I JUST I REALLY WANT TO KNOW LIKE. IT'S IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THERE'S A LOT. THERE'S A LOT MORE OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU DON'T HAVE A GREAT ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT WHAT THAT MIGHT BE. THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE THIS YEAR'S USE. THANK YOU MEMBER MEN. IN THE CAMPUS. CAMPUSES FIVE YEAR PLAN THERE'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS REQUESTED FOR STUDENT HOUSING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND THE CAMPUSES THAT SUBMITTED- IN THIS CYCLE THAT WERE NOT APPROVED. THERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE NOT AND EITHER IT WE'RE NOT ELIGIBLE BASED ON TIMING SO. JUST LIKE OTHERS THEIR CAMPUSES IT DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO RESPOND AND SO I'M- IN IN A ROUGH- OF BACKING NAPKINS COMPARING AGAINST OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN I THINK THE BILLION A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S KIND OF A ROUND NUMBER. IF YOU NEED TO INVESTMENT THERE THANK YOU AND UC'S. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN ARE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUBMITTED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF PROJECTS FOR THIS FIRST ROUND. WE HAVE A SET OF PROJECTS THAT RE NOT WITHIN THESE AFFORDABILITY METRICS AS LAID OUT IN THIS GRANT PROGRAM BUT THAT WOULD UTILIZED LEASE REVENUE BONDS BASED ON HIGHER STUDENT RENTS. WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTEEN SUCH PROJECTS- COMPOSED OF TOTAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BEDS PLANNED OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND THE TOTAL COST THE NEW USING THE METRIC OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BAD- IT'S ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT- THAT'S ALL I HAVE. SENATOR- CHAU VOTE. THANK YOU. I'M TRYING NOT TO CHUCKLE THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENT SENATOR FLARED- ADJOURNMENT- I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES- IN- COMMENTS THAT HE MADE EARLIER THE QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO. KIND OF GO ALONG WITH THAT TRAIN OF THOUGHT WITH REGARDS TO A POINT THAT WAS MADE TO ME- THIS PAST WEEKEND AND A TOUR THAT I MADE- IN WHEN A IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THIS QUESTION ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH- THE RENTS THAT WE EXPECT OURSTUDENTS TO PAY ARE THEY- AND I GUESS THIS IS GOING TO BE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MY QUESTION IS DO THEY CONSIDER THE- WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE RENT THAT IT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THE STUDENTS OR AT THE HOUSING AVAILABILITY FOR THE STUDENTS. IN GENERAL DO YOU FOLKS BASED THAT ON A- ACADEMIC YEAR FOR A CALENDAR YEAR. SO CALLOUS A CALENDAR YEAR CALENDAR YEAR SO THE HOUSING WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TWELVE MONTHS OF THE YEAR AT ALL. THREE CAMPUSES. YES THAT'S IT WITHIN STATUTES OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THAT CURRENTLY THE PRACTICE OR IS THAT MOVING FORWARD WELL. TWO BILLION PLUS ONE. I THOUGHT. DID THAT COME WHEN I WAS WAITING FOR US AT YAHOO AS WE'VE HEARD CONCERNS- SENATOR DISTANCED SAY EVER TENANTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OUR STUDENT HOUSING RENTAL RATES ARE BASED ON A NINE MONTH ACADEMIC CALENDAR AND STUDENTS CAN RENT. A DORMITORY ROOM FOR AN EXTRA COST DURING THE SUMMER. BUT THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A CONTRACT FOR TWELVE MONTHS. YES MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES OFFER GOT IT SOME DORMITORY BASIS YES. THE MOST BUT NOT ALL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE I WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER- AND HAVE US MOVING FORWARD JUST BECAUSE- IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO HOME- DURING THE SUMMER OR DURING BREAKS AND SO- YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING BACK OF MY YOU KNOW MY TIME IN SCHOOL AND- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO HOME BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHERE I THOUGHT I'M LIKE WELL WHERE DO I GO NOW- SO I UST. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY GIVING THEM PEACE OF MIND I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER AND I'M NOT SURE OF MY COLLEAGUES FEEL ABOUT THAT BUT THEY WE CONSIDER HOUSING FOR STUDENTS THAT WE DO CONSIDER A TWELVE MONTH CONTRACT OR THE AVAILABILITY TO HAVE THAT ACCESSIBLE FOR THEM FOR TWELVE MONTHS VERSUS JUST THE ACADEMIC YEAR- JUST. SOMETHING TO. PONDER UPON. I'M JUST PLANTING THE SEEDS ON THAT END. DO WE HAVE A QUESTION ON THE APPLICATION FOR HOUSING BY THE WAY. YOU MEAN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TWELVE YEAR YEAH. MONTHS HOUSE IF THEY'VE THERE'S A NEED WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT AT THAT QUESTION. I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE CC THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THIS YEAR'S USUALLY UC'S LET'S JUST PICK ONE ARE YOU SEE DO YOU HAVE THAT ON YOUR QUOTE- YOUR QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT. TWELVE MONTHS. I'M SO SIR I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON WHETHER OR NOT WE ASK THE STUDENTS THAT QUESTION MA'AM LET ME TRY THE CSU FOR SENATOR TROUBLED DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. I DO NOT BUT- WE WERE PLANNING TO ACCOMMODATE THE HOUSING DURING THE SUMMER. WE JUST MAY HAVE TO MOVE THEM TO. A CERTAIN DORM SO WE DON'T HAVE KIDS OUT SPREAD OUT ACROSS DIFFERENT. HOUSING TYPES OF WHEN THERE'S FEWER STUDENTS THERE DURING THE SUMMER THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THE DISCUSSION YOU HAD WITH HOUSING DIRECTORS. THANK YOU. HI I APPRECIATE THE TERM KIDS THE- I THOUGHT I WAS AN ADULT WHEN I WAS A STUDENT. AND COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE ONE MORE. YOU HAVE TO CROSS A TWELVE CAMPUSES ABOUT HALF OF THEM OFFER HOUSE SCENE IN THE SUMMER ON THE OTHERS DO NOT. OKAY REISER HAVE WE ARE GO HEAD I JUST I HOPE THAT WE CAN RECONSIDER- THE HOUSING AVAILABILITY- TO OUR STUDENTS ON A- BASED ON A CALENDAR YEAR VERSUS AN ACADEMIC YEAR JUST AS AN OPTION FOR THOSE THAT MAY NEED IT. FOR ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARM. THAT WAS A REALLY DETAILED CONVERSATION I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR TO PUT IF WE SPENT AN HOUR ON EVERYONE OF THE REMAINING ITEMS WE WILL BE HERE TILL TEN O'CLOCK TONIGHT BUT I THINK THE FIRST TWO ITEMS WERE THE ONES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THAT. THE THE- BIGGEST ONES TO CONSIDER AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THIS AND A GOOD CONVERSATION AND WE WANT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT AND WHAT THE FINAL BUDGET ACTIONS ARE NOT I HAVE TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY SNARKY COMMENT TO THE CSU SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT. HE IN THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL WE ADDED ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CSU. A BILLION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND FOUR HUNDRED FOR OPERATING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR HOUSING AND- AND THE RESPONSE WAS TO ASK FOR FIFTY MILLION MORE SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRIORITIZE WITHIN THE ADDITIONAL MONEY WHAT YOU THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT IF. IF YOU REALLY STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT FIFTY MILLION IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAN WITHIN WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOU MIGHT DECIDE TO PRIORITIZE IT OVER. SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT BE AN EXPENDITURE OR ME THANK EVERYONE. OF FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE. WHICH IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACTS WITH UC AND CSU AND THE ROAD MAP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT PRESENTERS REBEKAH KIRK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JENNIFER PURCELL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AGAIN SAY JEFF FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN LISETTE FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND RYAN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WILL TAKE HIM IN THAT ORDER AND I THINK GOING FORWARD. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR A FIVE MINUTE PRESENTATIONS SO A BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE TO STEP THROUGH THE REST OF THE AGENDA SO. I WILL- RECOGNIZE PEOPLE IN THE ORDER THAT I JUST IDENTIFIED FOR. ISSUE TWENTY THREE START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THE MORNING RECORD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED COMPACTS WITH THE UC NCS YEAR AND THE ROAD MAP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THESE FIVE YEAR AGREEMENTS REPRESENT DISCRETE SET OF SHARED PRIORITIES. BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION EACH SEGMENT. BUT THEY ALSO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERSECTING COOPERATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY OUTLINED MANY OF THE SPECIFIC GOALS AND COMMITMENTS FOR EACH SEGMENT WHICH BUILD UPON EACH SYSTEMS EXISTING CALLS. BEING UC TWENTY THIRTY THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE CCC VISION FOR SUCCESS. BROADLY SPEAKING THE GOALS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE AGREEMENT ENHANCE ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY'S INCREASE AFFORDABILITY IMPROVE EQUITY INCREASE OUR SIGNAL COOPERATION TO BENEFIT STUDENTS. STRENGTHEN CAREER PIPELINES FOR HIGH NEED FIELDS AND PROMOTE ACCESS TO ONLINE SECURE ONLINE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. ADDITIONAL DETAIL WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE RELEASE OF THE MAYOR VISION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO JENNIFER PATELLA FROM THE L. A. ELLIS WE HAVE SEVERAL OVER ARCHING CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S COMPACT AND ROADMAPS. SO THERE'S FIFTY FIVE IN TOTAL EXPECTATIONS ACROSS THE THREE SEGMENTS YOU CAN SEE THOSE ON AGES TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO OF YOUR AGENDA. THERE ARE INCONSISTENCIES IN THE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS SO IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AFFORDABILITY CATEGORY ONLY YOU SEE IS EXPECTED TO OFFER A TAX FREE PATHWAY FOR UNDERGRADUATES. ONLY UC AND CSU ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE COST OF TEXTBOOKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. NONE OF THE EXPECTATIONS NONE OF THOSE FIFTY FIVE EXPECTATIONS COME WITH A COST ESTIMATE. FOR THE SEGMENT'S MAINTAINABLE TO ABSORB THE COST OF SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS WITHIN THE PROPOSED SPACE INCREASES BUT LIKELY OTHERS WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE TRADITIONAL STATE OF PRACTICES TO PROVIDE THAT ABOVE THE BASE INCREASE. THE STATE ALSO NORMALLY FUNDS FINANCIALLY IT OBJECTIVES VERY UNLIKELY YOU SEE COULD PROVIDE DEBT FREE EDUCATION FOR EVERY UNDERGRADUATE WITHIN ITS EXISTING RESOURCES. EXPANDING PROGRAMS AND HEALTH CARE AND CLIMATE ACTION FIELDS WOULD VERY LIKELY TAKE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THE PLANS DON'T SEEM TO BE HOLDING TOGETHER FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. THANK UNDER ALSO SET FORTH. FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE SEGMENTS MASS ONE OR MORE OF THE EXPECTATIONS. SEPARATELY THE LEGISLATURE TRIES TO ENSURE THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE APPROPRIATE O JUST A COUPLE OF THE FIFTY FIVE EXPECTATIONS AREN'T MEL MATT THE SEGMENTS ONE INPUT ALL OF THEIR BASED INCREASE- ACT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE AT ISSUE. IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT FOR GOING A FUNDING INCREASE WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE REPERCUSSION THAT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO REVISIT THAT POLICY INTERVENTION THE PROGRAM DESIGN REALLOCATE EXISTING RESOURCE SAYS. IN SOME INSTANCES A SEGMENT MIGHT EVEN NEED MORE RESOURCES TO MEET PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS. THINKING THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE REPERCUSSIONS FOR MISSING ANY PARTICULAR EXPECTATION THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME CAREFUL DELIBERATION. WHAT ARE YOUR BUT PLANS LIKE COMPAQ AND ROAD MAPS THEY ALSO TEND TO GET OFF TRACK THERE HASN'T BEEN A CONTACT IN THE PAST THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS PROPOSED. SOMETIMES FISCAL CONDITIONS IMPROVE SOMETIMES THEY WERE SON. LASTLY OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN IS THAT WHEN GOVERNOR'S AND GO DIRECTLY TO THE STATEMENTS AND ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET PLANS THEY SIDESTEPPED THE LEGISLATURE. THOUGH AS PART OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WORK WITH THE SEGMENTS. THAT DECIDE HOW THEY'RE FINDING MODELS AND PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. SO WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROCESS OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE BUDGET CYCLE AND WHATEVER YOU SETTLE UPON AS YOUR FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE ADJUSTMENTS. YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND PUT THOSE IN BUDGET ACTON TRAILER LEGISLATION FOR THE SAKE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SAY OVER TEN AND FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR HIS PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE UNIVERSITY AND BETTER SERVE STUDENTS THROUGH A FIVE YEAR FUNDING COMPACT THAT OFFERS RELIABLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR OUR CAMPUSES AND DEAR AND THE ARTICULATION OF SHARED GOALS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COMPACT FOCUSES TO UNIVERSITIES FUTURE WORK ON ACCESS. ACCESS AFFORDABILITY IN AND INTERSEGMENT FULL COLLABORATION. THE UNIVERSITY IS REQUESTING THAT THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTI YEAR COMPACT REMAIN ASPIRATIONAL RATHER THAN INSTITUTE PUNISHMENTS FOR DO UNIVERSITIES FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIC METRIC. TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SHARED GOALS WE COULD PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTING OR BRIEFINGS TO LEGISLATORS AND THEIR STAFF. UNIVERSITY SEES THE COMPACT GOALS AS A CONVERSATION ON REACHING SUCCESS TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH UNIVERSITY WOULD MEASURE UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN ADDITION WE WOULD UTILIZE THE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT METRIC RATHER THAN STUDENT HEAD COUNT. USING THESE CRITERIA A 1% UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT GROWTH WOULD BE JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS ANNUALLY. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN INCREASING UC UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT BEYOND THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND INCLUDED IN THE COMPACT WE DO REQUEST THAT EACH STUDENT BE PROVIDED THE FULL STATE SHERIFF THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FUNDING. RECEIVING FULL FUNDING FOR EACH STUDENT IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAMPUSES ABILITY TO HIRE FACULTY OFFER ENOUGH COURSES AND PROVIDE STUDENTS SERVICES NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU MOVE ON THE CA COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. SENATOR LAYER TO MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE LESTAT NUMBER EXECUTIVE VICE YOU THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ROADMAP FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES SETS A BOLD VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AS A LEVER FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND MEANS TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS. THIS FRAMEWORK BUILDS UPON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS I WOULD CREATE NEW AVENUES FOR DATA SHARING CROSS SYSTEM COLLABORATION AND FUNDS RESOURCE IS- FOR BOTH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT HAVE CLEAR EMPHASIS ON- I AM ADVANCING STUDENT SUCCESS AND CLOSING RACIAL EQUITY GAPS. THE ROADMAP COMPLEMENTING EXISTING GOALS WITHIN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND VALIDATES THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PRIORITIZE OVER THE FIVE LAST FIVE YEARS BUT JOINS US IN THE HARD WORK THAT STILL CONTINUES AS WE RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE- COMPANY CAN COLLEGES HAVE DILIGENTLY WORKED TOWARD TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS- LOCAL DISTRICTS ALSO ADOPTED VISION GOALS AND ALIGN WITH WITH AB EIGHTEEN OWN NINE I'M TO PUT STUDENTS FIRST AND HOLD SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE TO INFRASTRUCTURES AND ENSURE THAT STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN SIXTY. SO WE SEE GREAT ALIGNMENT ONE AND THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN SOME OF THE CLEAR GOALS AND GETS DECENT FOOD ON GOALS AROUND COMPLETION TRANSFER EFFICIENCY EMPLOYMENT- AND AS I MENTIONED ON SUCCESS IN EQUITY CLOSING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS ALL REGIONS AND ACROSS ALL STUDENT GROUPS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ROAD ADDING MOMENTUM TO THE WORK AND JOINING US IN PARTNERSHIP IN THESE LONG HELD GOALS SO THEY COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T HAVE TO GO EDITABLE ALONE WE HAVE STATE LEADERSHIP ON ON OUR SIDE THANK. YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON THE COUNTY STATE IN SYSTEM. THANK YOU SEVEN LAYER THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR- IN TERMS OF OUR COMMENTS ON THE CONTACT YOU KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR THIS ISSUE. ESPECIALLY FOR FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY PREDICTABILITY- IT'S NOT GOING TO FIND ALL OF UNIVERSITIES NEEDS AND REVIEW THIS BUDGET COMPACT IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET TO PROTECT UNIVERSITY FROM. THOSE ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT ARE LIKELY TO ARRIVE. THAT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LAWS AND THERE ARE NO CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE ANY BUDGETARY ASSURANCES OR PREDICTABILITY FROM YOUR YEAR. SO WE THEREFORE ARE GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT. I ALSO JUST FOR BREVITY'S SAKE WILL ONLINE A LOT OF WE AGREE- A LOT WITH WHAT THAT REPRESENTED FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STATED ABOUT TRUMP ROMANCE. TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY PAYING VISITS TO OUR SENATORS AND SEVEN MEMBERS TO GIVE UPDATES. ON- ON THE OUTCOMES OF THE GOALS WERE VERY OPEN TO THOSE SORTS OF CONVERSATIONS SO MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE SAY PRETENDING AND I ARE ARE LINE PRETTY WELL IN THE CONTACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME BEGIN WITH A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT IS. THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED HIS BUDGET WITH THE IDEAS FOR THE CONTACTS ON JANUARY TENTH AND WE HEARD IT IN FEBRUARY AND SAID. THAT IT WAS NOT A DONE DEAL FOR US TO WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE COMPACT AND KNOW WHAT'S IN IT WE HAVE THE- THE GLOBAL THINGS BUT WE'RE STILL HAVING A PRESENTATIONS. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHAT ENFORCEMENT MIGHT BE AN ENFORCEMENT IS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT SEEN A CONTACT. WHEN MIGHT WE ACTUALLY SEE A COMPACT THAT IS BEING REFERRED TO HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO ANTICIPATE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND THE ACTUAL CONTACT AND ROADMAP DOCUMENTS ALONG WITH THE MAY REVISION RELIEF. OKAY THANK YOU SB BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION RAISED WHICH IS WE WANT TO GO PAST THE GOVERNOR ORIGINALLY SAID. DO I THINK FIVE POINT THREE OR OR SOME 5% INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE THREE BRANCHES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPACTS AND WE WANT TO GO FURTHER AND WE ALSO WANT TO KNOW. WHETHER WE TRIP OVER THE CONTACT CONTACTED TRYING TO HELP THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES FURTHER IN WHAT WE DO IN THE BUDGET SO THOSE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND WE JUST AS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANS YES YOU ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT. WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM MIGHT BE AND I A LISTENING TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAYING WE THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION MY GUESS IS IT'S A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC THAN JUST A CONVERSATION IT'S REALLY WORKING AT IF YOU GET ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO AND SOME OF THE METRICS ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE MEASURED AND TIED TOGETHER BUT- IT SEEMS LIKE. FOUR MONTHS AFTER IT WAS PROPOSED THIS IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IT IS SO WE WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATE JUDGMENT IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN BEFORE MOVING TO MY COLLEAGUES LET ME JUST ASK ONE OTHER QUESTION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THAT IS THAT- AT THE TIME WE HEARD THE BUDGET- IN FEBRUARY. THE NOT EVERY CAMPUS HAD REPORTED ON ENROLLMENT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL STATUS OF ENROLLMENT TRENDS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHAT WHAT DID THOSE REPORTS INDICATE TO YOU. INTERLAYER TO CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES THAT HAVE SEEN- AS EXPECTED IMPACTS FROM THE PANDEMIC- YEAR TO YEAR ENROLLMENT IS DOWN NEARLY. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC'S ACTUALLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ROMANS ARE DOWN NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS IN STUDENT RANGE AND JUST EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT. DON'T MEMORIZED THE TOTAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT- WHAT IS THE PERCENT OR RELATIVE MEASURE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BEING DOWN. IT ROUGHLY- CAN'T ARM AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC THE CALIFORNIA ECOLOGISTS ARE ONE POINT ONE. MILLION STUDENTS SO WE'RE NOW CLOSER TO ONE POINT EIGHT I'M SO ROUGHLY. I THINK. FROM YOU SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT KNOW WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE YOU WENT FROM ONE POINT ONE MILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT'S NOT A LOSS OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. WE'RE WE'RE CLOSER TO- IN OUR TOTAL ENROLLMENT WE WERE CLOSER TO WAR ONE ONE POINT TWO R. AT THE START- ESTIMATE DOWN TO ONE POINT ONE BUT WE'RE ROUGHLY DOWN ABOUT 14% FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN PLAN I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WERE DOWN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BORDERS TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FIT IN THAT BECAUSE YOU WENT FROM ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO ONE POINT ONE MILLION. WHAT WERE IN MY RUDIMENTARY CASE THROUGH TWELFTH MATH THAT IS NOT FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS. ARE THERE TO FIGHT TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE ON THIS I THINK- SHE'S TALKING ABOUT- FPS FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT- IN ENROLLMENT BASIS- THE SYSTEM WENT FROM. YOU JUST TAP IT YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE CHRISTOPHER FERGUSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT AND APOLOGIES YOUR CORRECT GOOD I JUST WANT TO GAS STATIONS FOR THE LISTENING AUDIENCE SO- KEEP GOING STARTED RIGHT. NO NO OKAY APPRECIATE THE- THE NOTE I DID FORGET TO MENTION MY NAME SO ON A ROLLING BASIS THE SYSTEM WAS AROUND TWO POINT ONE TO TWO POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS. NOW ON A ROLLING BASIS IT'S AROUND. BERKELEY. ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TOTAL STREAMS. AND SO THAT X. THE- FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. THANK YOU CORRECT ANYBODY ANYTHING YOU WANT TO. ADD TO THAT ANSWER- FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BEFORE WE MOVE ON. NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR LOOKING INTO THAT AND THAT CLARITY GREAT THANK YOU LET'S GO TO MY COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS.

WANTING TO REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BY EACH SEGMENT AND TO FURTHER THAT WORK WITHIN THE FIVE YEAR TERM OF THE CONTRACT. LOOKING AT REALLY THE FOCUS ON SHARED PRIORITIES AND GOALS. WE DO HOWEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WORK HAS BEEN APPROACHED SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY BY EACH SEGMENT AND SO SOME OF THE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE L. L. HAS SPOKEN TO. REALLY AROSE JUST BY NATURE OF AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED AS WELL AS COMMITMENTS AND GOALS THAT EACH SEGMENT WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE WITHIN THE TERM OF THE COMPACT AND WITHIN THE RESOURCES.

THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH M. I'M GLAD THIS IS JUST BEING AIRED AND DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THE SENATE WANTS TO DO. I WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON STAND BY. AND THAT IS OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT. OF LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX WITH THE GOVERNOR VETOED AND WOULD'VE DONE. A MORE ON STUDENT AID- IT NOW WE'RE COMING BACK THAT BILL'S BEEN REINTRODUCED IN SOME FORM AND- IT REALLY SPECIFY SOME OF THE ADDITIONS THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE WANNA MAKE TO THIS PROGRAM. OR THEIR CONVERSATIONS GOING ON ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM THAT PROCESS OR THAT BILL IT'S GOING TO INFORM THE BUDGET DECISIONS AND I WONDERED IF ANYTHING IS. IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN COMMENT ON WHETHER THERE ARE ANY CONVERSATIONS GOING ON ON RESOLVING THOSE CONFLICTS THAT CAME OUT OF THE VETO LAST YEAR. AS RECORDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY AWARE OF THE LEGISLATION THAT'S PROCEEDING THIS YEAR. OR FINANCIAL AID REFORM WE HAVE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION REGARDING THAT LEGISLATION- WE DON'T TIP TYPICALLY TAKE A POSITION ON LEGISLATIVE BILLS OR SPEAK TO A PROPOSALS AND LEGISLATIVE POLICY BILLS AND BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE UNTIL WE'VE HAD. AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT A FORMAL ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE. ABOUT SAID I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND INCREASE THE AND FINANCIAL AID AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY MORE BROADLY IN RECENT YEARS- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T LIST ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE. PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL. ONE WAS JUST HEARD IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE EARLIER ON STUDENT HOUSING STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN TECH FOR COFFEE GREEN. REALLY TAKEN AN EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON EDUCING A LOT OF A CORE COST DRIVERS THAT ARE DRIVING COSTS. GETTING A KIND OF A REAL ISSUE.

WHAT ABOUT THE BUDGET YOU'RE READY TO DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO WHAT'S HERE IN THE BUDGET AND IT PROVIDES SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT MIGHT SUPPORT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT EXIST. IN THAT BILL AND ELSEWHERE AND SO. I WOULD JUST NOT WANT TO TRIP OVER URSELVES AND WAITING FOR A BILL WHEN WE HAVE TO DO THE BUDGET BEFOREHAND AND WE WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO. TO ADDITIONAL STUDENT NADER ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS. NOW FOR SENATE GOVERNMENT CENTER GROW JOB I JUST WANT TO- JUST.

FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY WAS STATE THIRD LOWEST IN THE NATION ON THIS MEASURE. AS FAR AS AFFORDABILITY AND- NOTING HERE THAT IS THAT A TEN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION UPON GRADUATION SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. THAT'S A GOOD AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS THAT'S SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE- ACROSS THE NATION I THINK- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. THE NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE DEBT FREE COLLEGE I THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY REALLY GREAT A LITTLE THAT IS NOT THAT BAD I THINK IT IT PUTS YOU IN THIS ISSUE IN THE EDUCATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING AND IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE AN OVERALL COMMENT- HE BASICALLY WHEN WE HAD OUR HEARINGS EARLIER IN THE YEAR WE OUTLINED. WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES ARE THE ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS MOST OF FROM FROM THE- THE MAJOR PROPOSAL OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND BUILDING AND THE MAJOR PROPOSAL OF- ON GOING BASED SUPPORT. TO THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT ONCE WE ADDED BACK TO RESTORE- UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION UNDER WE DON'T STOP BY NOT HAVING- COLON THE VERY FIRST YEAR AND START TO GO BACK TO RIGHT WHERE WE WERE OR- HAVE THE- A UCLA ANDERSON FORECAST INCLUDE CLIMATE AND THEIR NUMBER OF ISSUES HERE AND SO I'M JUST PLEASE THEIR HERE. THEY ADDRESS THE POINTS THAT WE RAISED IN THOSE HEARINGS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADVOCATING FOR THEM AND- IN THE FINAL BUDGET PROCESS LET ME ASK THEIR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THE CENTER OF TROUBLE NO CENTERMAN. I AM A THE SENATE'S PROPOSALS HERE IN PENN THEM I HAD ONE QUESTION THIS MIGHT BE FOR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- GIVEN THE HIGH. RATE OF INFLATION THIS YEAR AND POTENTIALLY NEXT GOING IN NEXT YEAR- IT ARE THAT IS THE PROPOSED BUDGET IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER UP. MADE TO KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION. THANK YOU SIR THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION IT WOULD ALLOW US TO COVER THE FULL REGION'S PROPOSED BUDGET WITH SALARY INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND OUR- LABOR CONTRACTS. AND IT WOULD ALLOW US TO FIND THE OVER TARGET STUDENTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY ENROLLED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO FUNDING SO WE'RE VERY THANKFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- THAT COMPLETES OUR COMMENTS. ON THIS I'M GLAD TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WEAR THEM WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE TWENTY SIX WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR CONCEPT. IT IS THE SENATE PROPOSALS WITH REGARD TO THE CSU SYSTEM AND WE HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM LISA KING. OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND RUN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WILL BEGIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU I STOPPED ALSO PRESENT TO SEE IF YOU PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN NEED DURING YOUR TIME THE BEGINNING ON PAGE THIRTY SIX. A NUMBER OF ON GOING PROPOSALS THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING ON TOP OF THE AMOUNT INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE FOUNDATION. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE PROPOSED BASED APPLICATION PROCESS HERE FROM 5% IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. 16% UNDER THE SENATE PLAN. THERE'S ALSO ONGOING FUNDING PROPOSED BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FOR AN ADDITIONAL 1% INCREASE IN RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE INVOLVEMENT ON TOP OF WHAT'S REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MULTI YOUR CONTACT. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING FOR VERY STUDENTS SUPPORT. INCLUDING CHRIS YES HE'S GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND STUDENT BASIC NEEDS AFTER. TURN THE PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF ONE TIME PROPOSALS. TOTALING NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR CSU IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THE LAST MAJORITY OF THIS FUNDING WOULD GO TOWARD ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL OUTLAY. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE NOT PROVIDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BRING TOTAL FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE TO ONE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF ONE TIME PROGRAMMATIC AUGMENTATIONS WHICH ARE LISTED MORE THAN. IN YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO CLASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WILL MOVE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THANK YOU AGAINST CENTER LAYERED. SENATORS MY NAME IS RYAN STORE FROM THE CSU. THE GOVERNOR SPENDING PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS MEANINGFUL AND CONSEQUENTIAL. BUT THERE ARE MORE THERE- BUT MORE FUNDING IS BEING SOUGHT OUT FOR THIS ISSUES TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE VERY COMPETITIVE SALARIES POSITION POINTS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE HER EQUITY GAPS IN TO MEET THE GROWING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OUR CAMPUSES. NOW THE SENATE WELL TO WORK A PLAN SUBSTANTIALLY HELPS WITH MEETING THAT FISCAL NEED. AND REMAINING FUNDING GAP I'D LIKE TO TAKE TO TAKE THE SENATE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THE ELEMENTS OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRIORITIES. ARTICULATED BORDER TRUSTEES REQUEST ANOTHER WORDS WE SEE EYE TO EYE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION GRADUATION ISSUE INFRASTRUCTURE STUDENT BASIC NEEDS ANIMAL MICRO. SOME HAVE FOR THIS ISSUE I THINK THE SENATE FOR INCLUDING AS MANY NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN THE PLANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME MAKE A COMMENT IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO. THE ONE I JUST MADE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS AFTER HEARINGS IN FEBRUARY WE REALLY A DEN A I'D- ARE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT. WE WERE NEEDS AND THIS A PLAN ADDRESSES THEM WITH REGARD TO ADDITIONAL OF BASS AUGMENTATION WITH REGARD TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOUSING. IN INDIVIDUAL THINGS LIKE THE REBUILD OF THE- THIS ONE PACIFIC RANCH AFTER THE FIRE DESTROYED IT. AND ALSO THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND I THINK. THAT THIS IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN REAL PROGRESS MADE IN GETTING TO FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES AT CSU WHICH WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE ENROLLMENT ISSUES IF PEOPLE GRADUATED FOUR YEARS AND- IT BOTH HELPS PEOPLE. WITH NEEDING LESS FINANCIAL AID BUT IT ALSO HELPS CREATE SPOTS FOR OTHERS IF PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH IT FOR YEARS. AND THERE MIGHT BE A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT CERTAIN METRICS THAT UP. IS THAT MEASURE THAT OR REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S TARGETED TO THE CAMPUSES WHERE THERE. THERE HASN'T BEEN AS MUCH PROGRESS AS OTHERS SO- JUST MAKE THAT NOTE AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE SIDE. SENATOR MAN DOESN'T- APPARENTLY NEITHER TO CENTER A JOB OF- SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN.

THE SENATE DEMOCRAT BUDGET PLAN PROVIDES COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. AND THE PLAN ALSO PROVIDES ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN ONE TIME FUNDS. THE LARGEST ONGOING PROPOSAL PROVIDES SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN FUNDING FOR A PORTIONS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY BECAUSE DISTRICTS GENERAL PURPOSE MONIES. NO LARGEST ONE TIME PROPOSAL IN THE PLAN PROVIDES EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AT THE SENATE DEMOCRAT BUDGET PLAN MAINLY INCREASES FUNDING FOR EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS SUCH AS A STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM AND A PROGRAM. DESIGNED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE PLAN DOES INCLUDE SOME NEW INITIATIVES INCLUDING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO START.

CALL ATTENTION TO PROPOSED INCREASES TO EXISTING PROGRAMS ON GROUP REALLY ARE AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT TO FOCUS ON CORE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL SO THE COMMITMENT TO EXISTING- MOSTLY EXISTING RATHER THAN YOU- IS APPRECIATED BY DISTRICTS. AND LASTLY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH ONE TIME FUNDS TO REDUCE OUR BACKLOG IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND A PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA WOULD SUPPORT DISTRICTS IN DOING NOT IN THE SYSTEM OFFICE IN RESTRAINT OF BACKING HAPPEN. DID YOU HAVE ANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME MAKE THE COMMENT I MADE ON THE PREVIOUS TWO BRANCHES ONCE AGAIN. WHICH WOULD IN OUR HEARINGS WE ERRED OUT WHAT WE THOUGHT THERE WERE GREAT NEEDS IN THE ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON GOING FUNDING- THINGS LIKE THE- OF THE POINTED THE MESA PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP PACE THAT NEXT UP PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO CAP ON THE COLLEGES AND THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT- AND- ALL THE CALL AND I THINK THEY REALLY REFER.

ANALYSTS AT AVERETTE AGAIN FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE HAVE MICHELLE MILLION OF FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON STAND BY FOR QUESTIONS SO- WHAT'S MOVING THAT ORDER ON ISSUE TWENTY EIGHT CYBERSECURITY BILL STARK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MORNING THAT. DAN AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ON- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OF WHICH TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS ON GOING. TO ADDRESS THE MODERNIZATION OF CCC OUR COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SENSITIVE DATA PROTECTION EFFORTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS PROPOSAL MIRRORS REQUEST INCLUDED IN THE LIST- THE CHANCE OFFICES TO REQUEST TO BETTER EQUIP COLLEGES TO PROTECT THEIR DATA AGAINST ATTACKS. SIMILAR TO THOSE ATTEMPTED OVER THE PAST ACADEMIC YEAR. I'M GOING FUNDING WOULD BE PRIMARILY UTILIZE FOR DISTRICTS TO HIRE ON CYBER SECURITY STAFF AS WELL AS THE OTHER SYSTEM WIDE OVERSIGHT. ONE TIME FUNDS WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE SECURITY UPGRADES FOR FOX NETWORKS AND CGC OF LIFE. I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL MOVE ON TO- TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. MOSTLY HOUSING WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE NEAR MAINTAINING INFORMATION SECURITY PREVENTING FRAUD ARE CRITICAL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPERATIONS AND STUDENT PRIVACY IS LAUDABLE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADDRESSING THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN JANUARY BUDGET WE FIND MERIT WITH SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THERE'S A NUMBER OF- THERE ON PAGES FORTY TWO AND FORTY THREE OF YOUR AGENDA. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ARE ON PAGES FORTY FIVE TO FORTY SEVEN OF THE AGENDA ARE REALLY CENTERED AROUND THE ALLOCATION METHOD FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDS AND THE LEGISLATURES NEED IN SOME CASES FOR CLARIFICATION MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON OF HIS FINEST VISITED PROPOSAL THE FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO PROPOSE TO COLLEGES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PROPOSE AN ALLOCATION METHOD FOR THE FUNDS SO WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE DIRECTED CANCERS OFFICE TO DEVELOP AN ALLOCATION THAT THAT THE PROVIDES A MINIMUM BASE. AMOUNT OF FUNDING PER DISTRICT. THE GOVERNOR OF HAS A PROPOSAL. AIMED AT CREATING STRONGER STATE LEVEL SYSTEM WELL LEVEL OVERSIGHT AND ASSISTANCE MISTER HANOVER JUST MENTION THAT WE FIND MERIT WITHOUT POLICY GOAL WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS AS PROPOSED STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY TEAMS A SYSTEM LEVEL OVERSIGHT BODY. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE POSITIONS PROPOSED IN THE POSITIONS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE NEXT ISSUE- IN THE AGENDA. REALLY TELL US COMPLAINTS OF CREATE SENATE ORG COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE WITH OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES AND POTENTIALS OF POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. CLARIFIED THE DIVISION OF LABOR AND THE DELINEATION OF FUNCTIONS AMONG THESE VARIOUS OF PROPOSED A STATE LEVEL ENTITIES. IS ALSO A ONE TIME FUNDS THAT WOULD GO TO COLLEGES AND SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN ALL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE MONEY BUT DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SIZE OF THE COLLEGE AS WELL AS ITS LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS. WHEN ALLOCATED FUNDS AND PRIOR TO ALLOCATING USE ONE TIME FUNDS. WE THINK THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SHOULD DEVELOP AND PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSED ALLOCATION FORMULA. ALSO SPECIFY WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM STANDARDS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WANTS COLLEGES TO GET UP TO. WITH REGARD TO CYBER SECURITY AND ALSO FOR THE ADMINISTRATION CHANCES OFFICE IDENTIFIED WITH THE ON GOING COST LIKELY WILL BE FOR COLLEGES TO MEANT MAINTAIN. CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS. FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE CCC APPLY PROPOSAL THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO UPGRADE THE COMMON APPLICATION PORTAL WE THINK BE OBJECTIVE HAS MERIT. WE DO NOTE IN OUR ANALYSIS YOU MINISTRATION ONLY PROVIDES COST JUSTIFICATION FOR ABORTION OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY MINISTRATION PROVIDE FULL. JUSTIFICATION BY MAJOR REVISION A FINAL DECISION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED IN MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEEWITH THAT WITH THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE- OUR SYSTEM NEEDS A STRONG INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES ESPECIALLY AS ASSEMBLY SECURITY. I NEED SENATE TAX- AND RANSOMWARE ATTACKS CONTINUE TO GROW IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALONE WE'VE HAD TO ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS BASED CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS FOR A TOTAL OF SIX OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE MODERNIZING STATE AND DISTRICT TO KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING- THE ONBOARDING PLATFORM OF CCC APPLY ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT FACULTY AND STUDENTS SENSITIVE DATA ARE PROTECTED FROM THESE ATTACKS THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY PROPOSALS AND PRIORITIES BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. AND OURS OUR SYSTEM BUDGET REQUEST. LOS SECURITY MODERN INVESTMENTS ARE TWO FOLD APPROACH RELYING ON STATE AND LOCAL ACTION GIVEN OUR GREEK DECENTRALIZED FUNCTION AND OUR ROLE IN SUPPORTING SEA LEVEL MONITORING. THE SMALL PORTION WOULD- GO TILL I'M GOING SOFTWARE COSTS SUCH AS- TWO FACTOR ATHENTICATION AND OTHER KEY SECURITY MEASURES BUT THE MAJORITY OF RESOURCES WITH SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION FOR ACCOUNTABILITY MONITORING IN TAILORING WORDS. ON FOR IT DISTRICTS THAT MAY HAVE LESS MATURE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES GIVEN THEIR SIZE AND POTENTIAL OF RURAL LOCATION. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE ACTIONS AND UPGRADES NOT BE DONE IN THE SILO WE WANT TO TACKLE GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECURITY RISK AND THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT ADVANCES AS BAD ACTORS BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED IN THEIR ATTACKS. SECOND WE WANT TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE THE STUDENT USER EXPERIENCE AS WE REDESIGN CCC APPLY WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO APPLY WHILE THE ENHANCED SECURITY SERVICES. A PRECARIOUS ART AND SCIENCE TO ADD SECURITY WHILE CREATING A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE IT'S A COMPLEX ENDEAVOR ENDING GROWING COMPLEX- SOCIETY BUT WE THINK THIS IS A WORTHY EFFORT. LASTLY AS PART OF OUR- THE STRATEGY IF YOU WANT TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA AND ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE MINIMUM LEVEL SECURITY ONE KEY ELEMENT IS ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS COMPLETE AN ANNUAL CYBER SECURITY SELF ASSESSMENT. IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY THESE ARE SOME OF THE CAL SECURE STATE STANDARDS- THAT ARE- THAT- EMBRACED BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND WE THINK ARE WORTHY FOR DISTRICTS AS WELL. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IT'S VERY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM. JUST YOU HAVE MAYBE ONE QUICKQUESTION AND IT GOT HANDLED A LITTLE BIT BUT- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAD RECOMMENDATIONS AND ANALYSIS AND I WAS GONNA ASK FINANCE AND- COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR IF YOU JUST COMMENT ON AND LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND DINNER HAVING TO FINANCE AGAIN- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE ELYAS RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS TIME- AGAIN I DOUBT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION WAS DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION. OR UPON REVIEW OF THE REQUEST MADE BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL. IS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT- THE NEEDS OF THE DISTRICT'S- AND SYSTEM WIDE. ROLLING TO THEIR CYBER SECURITY NEEDS ARE MET. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW WERE ABLE TO BEST DO THAT THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING NUMBER. I WOULD ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE. ON MOVING FORWARD AS WE MOVE TOWARDS MARRIAGE AND ABORTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST YOU SENATOR LATER JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I THINK THE L. A. O. HIGHLIGHTS OVRALL THEME OF WANTING ACCOUNTABILITY ON THESE BONDS AND SHOWING THAT DISTRICTS ARE MAKING PROGRESS SO ON THAT IS AN AREA THAT IS OF INTEREST TO US- AND SO ON AS THEY SHARED IN MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU- WANT OTHER IN INTEGRATION OF DATA REPORTING WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING DISTRICTS THAT NEED THE GREATEST- PROGRESS IN THEIR- TECHNOLOGY SECURITY AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT MAY BE. SMALLER MORE RURAL DISTRICTS SO WE DO HAVE A LINE IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS AND DATA COLLECTION IS A PRIORITY OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS IS CONSIDERING A REGULATION CHANGES THAT WILL GET COULD COMPLEMENT THESE AND ENSURE THE DISTRICTS ARE REPORTING WHEN THERE ARE INCIDENTS OF SUSPECTED FRAUD THE NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT WHICH IS I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S PRESENTATION. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID IT WAS INTERESTED IN CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED IN JUST SEEING IF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE MERIT SO WE WANT TO BE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE INTO FINALIZING THE BUDGET DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. MEMBERS OR QUESTIONS NO FROM THERE SO YOU VERY MUCH. ARE WE APPRECIATE THAT WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY NINE WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE STAND OF STAFFING. WE'RE GONNA HAVE- JENNIFER ACAC- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POSTING HOUSE AND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ANALYSTS AT NAVARRO FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WE'LL GO IN THAT ORDER DEPEND. OF BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI JENNIFER TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT NINE NEW POSITIONS. AT THE CCC CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND IN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT TEN ADDITIONAL NEW POSITIONS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THESE NEW RESOURCES WILL AID THE CCC CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND SUPPORTING CURRICULUM RELATED REFORMS TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION EFFORTS AND INCREASED IT OPERATIONS CAPACITY FOR DATA ANALYSIS RESEARCH LEGAL AFFAIRS DISTRICTS FISCAL HEALTH MONITORING AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIRTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE FORWARD WITH PAUL SEEN HOUSING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. THANK YOU POLICY KNOWS WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE HAS GIVEN THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE CHANCES OFFICE MORE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROGRAMS TO ADMINISTER. WE UNDERSTAND ADDITIONAL POSITIONS MAY BE WARRANTED TO CARRY OUT THIS ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. THE GOVERNOR'S ACTUAL PROPOSALS- IT OF A MIXED BAG JUSTIFICATION IN SOME CASES FOR SOME POSITIONS BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY JUSTIFIED IN OTHER CASES OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGES FIFTY TWO AND FIFTY THREE OF THE AGENDA. SO FIRST WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF TWO SPECIALIST POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT TRANSFER REFORM LEGISLATION THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST FALL BUT WE RECOMMEND MAKING THE POSITIONS LIMITED TERM RATHER THAN PERMANENT. AND HAVING THEM SUNSET AT THE END OF THE- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR WHICH IS WHEN HIS SIDE TRANSFERABLE MEDITATION COMMITTEE SUNSETS. SECOND WE APPROVALS TO ADDITIONAL SPECIALIST POSITIONS WILL BE ASSIGNED TO BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RISING SCHOLARS NETWORK. BUT WE RECOMMEND OF THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO IN THE UPCOMING OF BUDGET YEAR AND NOT WAIT T ADD THESE POSITIONS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. IN THIS IS BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ARE ARE STARTING UP RIGHT NOW TO COLLEGES AND THEY COULD USE SOME OVERSIGHT ASSISTANCE. THIRD WE RECOMMEND REJECTING COUPLE POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM AND COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION CURRICULUM AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORTS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE TO SPECIALIST POSITIONS WORKING IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AS FOR THE OTHER THIRTEEN PROPOSED POSITIONS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MAY NEED- THESE POSITIONS BUT TO DATE- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT DETAIL BACK UP TO JUSTIFY THE POSITIONS. SO WE- WITHHOLD RECOMMENDATION ON THOSE POSITIONS I RECOMMEND. GIVING THE ADMINISTRATION THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AND MORE WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION. AT THE MAY REVISION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STEEN HAUSER I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO LIST THE SET NOW BUT I THINK FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING AND THE SENATOR CHILLIN MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND CURRENTLY THEIR CHANCES OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE- MAJOR STATEWIDE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING RECENTLY AT NOT. ENACTED PRIORITIES AND LAWS HE DAVID CANCERS OFFICE ADMINISTERS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE PROGRAMS COMPARED TO THIRTY ONE JUST TEN YEARS AGO WITH ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN STAFF. THE CHANGES OFFICE VACANCY RATE FAR BELOW I'M STATE AVERAGES IN THE PROPOSED POSITIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND BOARD OF GOVERNORS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED THIRTY ONE POSITION FOR REQUESTS. ON THIS IS TO MEET I AND ADDRESS CORE GAP AREAS INCLUDING POLICIES AND INITIATIVES THAT- HIGH PROFILE WORK IN COMPLEX WERE ACROSS A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES. IN SOME OF OUR GREATEST. NEED TO- AREAS THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE RISING SCHOLARS TRANSFER FORM BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IMPLEMENTATION COMMON COURSE NUMBER IN FISCAL HELD. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES IN ZERO TAX COST INCREASE STUDENT RETENTION STRATEGIES HOW FRESH FOOD SECURITY BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY DIGITAL DIGITAL COURSE CONTENT DEVELOPMENT YOU'LL ENROLLMENT DATA SECURITY I'LL BE TEACHING WHY SUPPORTS ON TO NAME A FEW ABSENT RESOURCES TO EXPAND. ON AND IMPLEMENT THIS CRITICAL WORK INNOVATE AND- ENSURE THAT IT IS WE ARE COMPLIANT THE SYSTEM- THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DELIVER ON THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS THAT- SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF OUR SYSTEM. THE LIMITED ABILITY TO PROVIDE- THESE RESOURCES MEANS THAT WE JUST PILE LAUNCH MORE WORK. AND IT ALSO DELAYS- TIME. TO REPORTS AND ANALYSIS THAT MAYBE CRITICAL AND IN TO THE GOVERNOR AND LET. INTENT AND DELIVER. IN ADDITION BEES POSITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY DATA SYSTEMS AND COLLEGE LEVEL DECISION MAKERS TO FOSTER INTEGRITY INQUIRY TO SCALE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOLUTIONS AND CHALLENGES THAT OUR COLLEGES ARE FACING. AS WE WORK TOWARDS MORE EQUITABLE STUDENT SUCCESS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN- ORIGINAL PROPOSAL OF THIRTY ONE POSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY SERVE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- ONE COMMENT BEFORE WE GO THERE. FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE HEARING ROOM THE LIGHTS OR STROBING APPARENTLY IT'S NOT A SERIOUS ALARM SO JUST IN CASE AND IF YOU WERE GETTING READY TO EVACUATE THERE'S NO NEED TO. IF THIS CONTINUES WE MIGHT ARE THERE GOES OKAY I THOUGHT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIVERT SOME MONEY FROM THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING. IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED SO LET ME MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS ITEM WHICH IS THAT-THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE PRESENTATIONS WERE RIGHT. WE HAVE ADDED ALL THESE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WE SHOULD BUDGET ACCORDINGLY. AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE A CHECK AS TO WHETHER THIS IS THE ADEQUATE LEVEL WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT BUT THE CONCEPT IS RIGHTS SO. I'M GLAD THAT WE HEARD ANY COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES.
