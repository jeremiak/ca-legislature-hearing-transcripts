REPRESENT A DISTRICT I AND

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:47.799
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:49.401
GROWING AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:51.703
THAT ARE SHRINKING IN TERMS OF

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.939
ENROLLMENT AND SO I CERTAINLY

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:56.108
UNDERSTAND THE- REASON FOR THE

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.409
HOLD HARMLESS THERE'S- THROUGH

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:59.010
BLACK CAST GOING BUT- THERE IS

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.011
A CHALLENGE FOR THE SCHOOL

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.179
DISTRICTS I KNOW PEOPLE

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:02.347
REFERRED MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:03.949
BUT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO.

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:04.783
ARE AREAS WHERE THE

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.285
POPULATION'S GOING ELK GROVE

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:08.854
THE THOMAS THOSE TYPES OF AREAS.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.788
THE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:11.289
STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.258
THEY WERE MADE SO THERE'S GOING

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:14.559
TO SHIFT BECAUSE A COVETED BUT

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.994
THERE WERE READY DEMOGRAPHIC

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.362
CHANGES THAT WERE HAPPENING

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.997
BASED ON JUST DEVELOP THE

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:19.965
NEIGHBORHOOD SO CAN YOU SPEAK

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:23.502
TO. WHAT THE APPROACH IS FROM

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:24.936
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT HOW

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.038
WE NEED TO HANDLE THIS BECAUSE

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:28.206
IT REALLY PUTS THEM INTO A BIND

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:30.208
I MEAN IF. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN

00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:31.009
THEY WOULD STILL BE GETTING AN

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.978
INCREASE IN OUR LCF PROGRAM IS

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.679
GROUNDED ON THE MONEY FOLLOWS A

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:37.115
STUDENT SO. I GET IT YOU KNOW

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:38.016
WHICH IS A LOT OF CHAOS GOING

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.852
ON- BUT FOR. DISTRICT THAT WERE

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.420
PROJECTING AN INCREASE JUST

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:45.891
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE'S GONNA

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:46.458
BE GROWTH IN THEIR COMMUNITY

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:48.426
THAT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:49.327
TO HELP THEM SO THERE'S

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:50.996
POSSIBLY A SPIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:23:51.062 --> 00:23:53.298
SHIFT SCHOOLS BUT ARE THINGS

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.233
BECAUSE A COVERED RELATED BUT

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.468
YEAH OF THE SCHOOLS THAT

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.470
ALREADY HAVE A NATURAL GROWTH

00:23:58.537 --> 00:23:59.905
ARE THEY GOING TO BE PENALIZED

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:00.605
BECAUSE OF THIS SO IS THERE

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:02.741
SOME WAY WE CAN PROVIDE SOME

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.442
ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FACT IS

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:05.377

FOLLOWING YEAR AND A SCHOOL

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.497
DISTRICTS HAVE TO DO THESE

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.599
PROJECTIONS ANYWAY FOR THEIR-

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.833

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.979
DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO

OPPOSE THE HOLD HARMLESS AT THE

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.578
MOMENT- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:54.312
BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:55.680
STABILITY FOR A SCHOOL

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.682

THAT WE DO ALSO HAVE SCHOOL

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:09.794
DISTRICT OF THE SUFFERING SOME

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:12.263
DISTRESS BECAUSE- NOT BECAUSE

THEY HAVE TO THEY MAY EVEN

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.302
ANTICIPATED A BUDGETED FOR THE

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.770

WHOLE HECK A LOT OF ELEVEN

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.185
MONIES IN MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:30.955
ACTUALLY DID A ZOOM. CALL WITH

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.424
THE SUPER DISCOURSE TONY

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.293
THURMOND- AND MAN MY

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.796
SUPERINTENDENTS AND ONE OF THE

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:39.330
THINGS THAT CAME UP ON THE

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:42.166
CALLS WERE LIABILITY. AND I DID

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.868
I LOOK THROUGH THE BUDGET AND I

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:46.103
DIDN'T SEE ANY AUGMENTATION FOR

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.005
LIABILITY SO LET'S. ASSUME THAT

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:51.475
WE'RE GOING TO BACK TO SCHOOL-

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.043
WHICH IS A QUESTION MARK I

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:54.145
THINK. THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:56.080
FIGURE OUT. A VOTE WE HAVE AN

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.982
OUTBREAK AND THEN LIABILITY

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.318
WHAT WHAT WITH THE- BOY THAT

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:02.086
LOOK LIKE- BECAUSE I KNOW THE

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.155
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. ON THAT

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.990
WE SPOKE WITH THE ENERGY THE

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.658
DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.026
THE OBVIOUSLY IF THEY HAVE AN

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:10.428
OUTBREAK WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:12.496
LIKE- FINANCIALLY FOR THEIR

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:26.344
SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND SO I AS

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.181
THE BUDGET DOES NOT CONTAIN- AS

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:36.087
ANY DISCUSSION OF FISCAL

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:38.956
HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CAN

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:42.493
CAN YOU REPEAT IT. YEAH WELL MY

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.996
I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT. LET'S

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:47.198
SAY THAT A SCHOOL OPENS BACK UP

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.966
THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING THEY

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:51.502
HELP OFFICER IN THE- THEY'VE

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.537
HAVE P. P. EASE ALL THE THINGS

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:54.639
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.907
THEY GET AN OUTBREAK. AND

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:58.809
THERE'S RISK IN THAT AND THEN

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.979
SOME PARENTS. SUSE I ME I IT'S

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.114
GOING TO BE I THINK IT CAN BE

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.084
DIFFICULT TO. TO PERSONAL KEEP

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.653
A FACE MASK ON OF FIVE YEAR

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.621
OLDER AS A YEAR OLD AND THE

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:11.789
WHOLE I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:16.560
CONCERN FROM. SCHOOL BOARDS

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.496
THAT THERE IS A HUGE LIABILITY

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.597
AND NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.732
THAT IT'S- IT'S THE SAME PLACE

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.167
IN BUSINESS AS WELL I KNOW THAT

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:24.235
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION

SICK AND- THERE IS A DEATH

00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:34.745
MAYBE EVEN AND THEN WHO'S

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:38.249

SO THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:36.066
OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE ALLOCATION

COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.318
THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW. IT WOULD

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:49.452

SENATOR THAT'S CORRECT AS MY

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.601
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT THE

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.270
COMMITMENT TO MAKING THIS

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.705
POLICY CHANGE WOULD NEED TO BE

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:11.307
MADE WELL IN ADVANCE BECAUSE OF

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.608
THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:14.444
ISSUES IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.646

THOSE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS SO

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.817
THAT IT'S UP AND RUNNING. DO

YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE A-

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.887
ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT WOULD COST

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.395
DON'T HAVE A COST ON HAND FOR

WHAT WOULD COSTS TODAY BUT I

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.365
THINK THE GENERAL THINKING AND

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:36.766
WHY WE DON'T HAVE THAT COST

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.335
ESTIMATE IS THAT- THERE WOULD

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:41.771
BE SIGNIFICANT MANUAL WORK

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.773
AROUNDS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.474
IT WOULD INCREASE THE

LIKELIHOOD OF ERRORS FOR WE TO

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:49.045

LAW. THERE ARE CLASSES- FIRE OR

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:34.534
DID YOU NOT FALL. NEATLY INTO

IN THE STATE BUT- IT IS IN OUR

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:03.797
VIEW A LOOPHOLE THAT NEEDS TO

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:06.733
BE CLOSED- BECAUSE THESE

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.370
WEAPONS- ARE SIMILAR TO ASSAULT

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.705

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:57.050
JUSTICE TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:59.352
THESE REGULATORY OF THIS NEW

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:00.487
RECORD THESE NEW REGULATORY

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:01.822
MEASURES ON THESE FIREARMS AND

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:04.024
SO IT IS THERE IS AN ACCESS TO

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:12.265
THE BUDGET. THIRTY NIELSEN. BY

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:14.634
SENATOR ROCK. MADAM CHAIR I DO

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:16.570
HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS WHEN

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:17.938
I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS LAST

01:46:18.004 --> 01:46:20.841
NIGHT I WAS VERY OFFENDED. AND

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:26.246
ANGRY. TOO OFTEN NOW. MAJOR

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:28.281
POLICY IS SLIPPED IN TO THE

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:29.916
BUDGET AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:32.352
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I FIND

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:35.522
YOUR REASONING VERY DEFICIENT.

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:37.324
AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:39.593
ARROGANCE TO SAY WELL THIS IS

01:46:39.659 --> 01:46:41.128
SOMETHING THAT WE JUST WANT TO

01:46:41.194 --> 01:46:44.931
DO AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS AND-

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:47.234
IF I DON'T EVEN AGREE WITH THAT.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.736
BUT THE POINT IS CIRCUMVENTING

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:52.372
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:55.075
IS REPREHENSIBLE IN MY SIGNAL

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:57.778
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:59.513
AT THE HORSESHOE IS THIS IS NOT

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.581
THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:04.017
LEGISLATURE. JUST BECAUSE YOU

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.786
CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT MAYBE

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:08.655
AND GET THE VOTES. IT'S A GREAT

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:10.257
DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.225
CALIFORNIA. WHO DON'T KNOW

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:14.294
ABOUT THESE GAMES BEING PLAYED

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:17.330
IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. SENATOR

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:23.703
OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:26.006

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:33.680
IF WE LIKE POLICY IT'S OKAY AND

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:35.982

BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS I DO

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:45.992
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TREAT

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:47.360
IT LIKE A POLICY COMMITTEE IN A

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:50.063
POLICY DISCUSSION. AND PROVIDE

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.165

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:30.677
LOGICAL. TO ALLOW PEOPLE THAT

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:33.580

HOUSES CLOSELY MODERATORS- THE

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.514

MUCH GETTING. FOLKS TO GO OUT

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.320

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:50.521
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT

02:23:50.588 --> 02:23:53.992
AS WAS THE CASE IN IN MIGHT BE

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.932
FOR REQUIREMENT TO FILE TAXES

IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF THEY DID-

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:03.968
THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET THIS

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:06.204
BENEFIT BECAUSE THE CREDIT IS

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:07.305
REFUNDABLE MEANING THAT EVEN IF

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:08.706
THEY DON'T HAVE A TAX LIABILITY

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:10.742
OF THAT SIZE THEY COULD STILL

02:24:10.808 --> 02:24:11.909
GET THAT CREDIT THEY FILE THEIR

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:13.945
TAXES BUT- I'M TO SOMEONE

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:14.679
WANTED MORE INFORMATION FOR

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:19.550

FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:22.253
ADDITIONAL EARNED INCOME TAX

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.654
CREDIT OUT OF REACH THE BECAUSE

02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:24.956
WE KNOW THAT WHILE AT THE

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:28.059
FEDERAL LEVEL THIS PROGRAM HAS

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:28.693
BEEN AROUND FOR SEVERAL DECADES

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.261
WE'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR FOUR

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:30.995
YEARS AT THE STATE LEVEL LIKE

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:37.368
WE. ONLY TO SIXTEEN. I IT'S

02:24:37.435 --> 02:24:39.604
JUST WELL AS OUR TAXES IN A PRO

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.005
WILL HELP THE WORD OUT BUT FOR

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:43.074
THIS YOU SIMPLY TO YOUR THREE

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.108
YEAR TAX CO WHEN YOU'RE FINE

02:24:44.175 --> 02:24:45.376
TAX AND HE'S BE ABLE TO RECEIVE

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:48.579
THAT OF DIRECTLY. SO A FOLLOW

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:50.248
UP. IN TWO THOUSAND. I IN

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:52.050
ASSEMBLY WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:53.851
STONE ACTUALLY. READ THE BILL

02:24:53.918 --> 02:24:56.788
AND- AND I WAS ONE OF THE FEW

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:57.288
PEOPLE ON MY SIDE ALLEN

02:24:57.355 --> 02:24:58.923
ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS A GREAT

02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:01.826
IDEA TO. HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE.

02:25:01.893 --> 02:25:03.961
REALLY NOT PAYING A TAX I MEAN

02:25:04.028 --> 02:25:05.329
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BARKING

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:08.466
BUT THERE BELOW THAT. LEVEL OF-

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.701
THRESHOLD OF PAIN BUT YOU THE

02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:11.702
THEY EARNED INCOME TAX

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.538
BASICALLY WAS. THAT

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.573
INCENTIVIZING THEM TO WORK. AND

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:16.374
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:19.177
BETWEEN THIS AND TWO THOUSAND

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:21.079
AND FIFTEEN. THE LEGISLATION

02:25:21.145 --> 02:25:25.249
WAS PASSED EARLIER. SO THE MAIN

02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:26.684
DIFFERENCE IS- WERE ACTUALLY

02:25:26.751 --> 02:25:29.720
LAST. ONE EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT-

02:25:29.787 --> 02:25:31.689
AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:33.958
THAT SO MYCOLOGY CHAMBER ONE IS

02:25:34.025 --> 02:25:35.359
ON THE LINE AND HE MIGHT BE

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:36.527
ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.229
TIME FRAMES- BUT I BELIEVE THAT

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:39.864
THERE WERE TWO STAGES OF

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:42.400
CHANGES THE FIRST STEP RELATED

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:43.501
TO WHETHER IT'S SELF EMPLOYED

02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:45.903
INDIVIDUALS- VERSUS BEING AN

02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:47.572
EMPLOYEE OF SOMEBODY ELSE- WERE

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:49.173
ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THE TAX AS

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:51.309
WELL AS THE ORIGINAL. TWENTY

02:25:51.375 --> 02:25:51.909
FIFTEEN LEGISLATION THAT YOU

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:53.611
MENTIONED I BELIEVE THAT IT

02:25:53.678 --> 02:25:55.279
RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN AGE

02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:57.248
GROUPS SO WASN'T ANY FILE ARE

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:59.150
OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SO

02:25:59.217 --> 02:26:01.919
THAT WAS ONE SET OF CHANGES THE

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:03.821
SECOND SET OF CHANGES OCCURRED

02:26:03.888 --> 02:26:05.189
LAST YEAR IN THE TWENTY

02:26:05.256 --> 02:26:07.692
NINETEEN ACTED. THE EIGHTY

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:08.626
BANDED AND BE IN. WHILE FROM I

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:10.795
THINK IT'S TOPPED OUT ABOUT

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:11.362
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:13.164
AND EXPAND THAT'S THIRTY

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:13.764
THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT

02:26:13.831 --> 02:26:16.167
IS ABOUT. THE YEARLY INCOME IF

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:18.536
YOU IMAGINE SOMEONE WORKING.

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:20.538
FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT ABOUT A

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:22.306
FIFTEEN DOLLAR WAGE- IT WOULD

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:23.774
COME TO ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

02:26:23.841 --> 02:26:24.909
DOLLARS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:26.978
THAT THAT KIND OF WORKERS AS A

02:26:27.044 --> 02:26:28.613
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD OR A FILE OR-

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:29.413
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.748
ASSISTANCE UNDER THE CREDIT.

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:31.582
AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.184
OCCURRED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN

02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:35.119
LEGISLATION. WAS INCLUDING AN

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:36.687
ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:38.356
TAX CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES OR

02:26:38.422 --> 02:26:39.590
HOUSEHOLDS WITH A LEAST ONE

02:26:39.657 --> 02:26:41.726
CHILD UNDER SIX I'M SO THAT WAS

02:26:41.792 --> 02:26:43.794
THE SERIES OF CHANGES A LEADING

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:45.129
UP TO THIS POINT. THE ONLY

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.964
CHANGE THAT THIS BUDGET MAKES

02:26:47.031 --> 02:26:48.766
OTHER THAN PRESERVING AT THE

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:50.535
SIZE OF A CREDIT WHICH WAS NOT

02:26:50.601 --> 02:26:51.936
EASY I KNOW GIVEN THE FISCAL

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:52.904
PRESSURES THAT WE'RE ALL

02:26:52.970 --> 02:26:54.472
FAMILIAR WITH RIGHT NOW. BUT

02:26:54.539 --> 02:26:56.340
DESPITE PRESERVES THAT AND THE

02:26:56.407 --> 02:26:58.176
ONLY CHANGES EXTENDING IT TO

02:26:58.242 --> 02:27:00.211
UNDOCUMENTED EITZEN FILERS WHO

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:02.647
HAVE A CHILD OR SEX. BUT THAT'S

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:03.581
BASICALLY THE WAY IT HAS

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:04.482
EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FIVE

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:06.684
YEARS. THEN I HAVE ONE LAST

02:27:06.751 --> 02:27:08.119
FOLLOW UP QUESTION DO YOU KNOW

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:08.986

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:16.060
PROGRAM. SO DON'T KNOW THE

02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:16.994
ANSWER TO THAT WHEN WE TRY TO

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:18.262
JAY CHAMBER ONE TO SEE IF HE

02:27:18.329 --> 02:27:21.899

TWENTY. WITH THAT IF FINANCE

OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AARON

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:50.274
EDWARDS ON THIS ISSUE AND I

02:30:50.341 --> 02:30:50.808
KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:52.076
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS- SO WE

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.377
WANT TO HELP PROVIDE OUT

02:30:53.444 --> 02:30:54.412
WHATEVER INFORMATION IS

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:56.380
NECESSARY- IN THIS HEARING

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.282
TODAY- I THINK THE FIRST THING

02:30:58.349 --> 02:30:59.884
I'LL START OFF WITH- AT THE TOP

02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:01.118
LEVELS THAT THE SALE AND

02:31:01.185 --> 02:31:02.953
TRANSFER OF ASSAULT WEAPONS. IS

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:04.355
ALREADY GENERALLY PROHIBITED IN

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:05.723
CALIFORNIA AND THERE REALLY

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:08.058
ONLY SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS TO

02:31:08.125 --> 02:31:10.060
THIS RULE I'M AND THIS POLICY

02:31:10.127 --> 02:31:11.295
THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IS

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:14.031
WITH GOOD REASON IT'S TO REDUCE

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:14.565
THE SPREAD OF THESE DEADLY

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:15.699
WEAPONS. PREVENTING GUN

02:31:15.766 --> 02:31:17.101
VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS PUBLIC

02:31:17.168 --> 02:31:19.036
HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE.

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:19.637
AND THAT'S WHY THE

02:31:19.703 --> 02:31:21.439
ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED AS PART

02:31:21.505 --> 02:31:23.040
OF ITS BUDGET PACKAGE. AND NOW

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.241
WE KNOW THAT THEIR REASONABLE

02:31:24.308 --> 02:31:25.976
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT.

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:27.678
WHETHER AN ISSUE LIKE THIS

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:28.312
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:30.014
BUDGET PACKAGE. BUT GIVEN HOW

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.315
WE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE

02:31:31.382 --> 02:31:32.883
LOOKING AT THIS AND GIVEN THE

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:35.286
FACT THAT BUDGETS ARE

02:31:35.352 --> 02:31:35.886
STATEMENTS OF VALUES ARE. THE

02:31:35.953 --> 02:31:37.621
SAME GOES WE FELT THAT IT WAS

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:38.422
IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THIS

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.257
ISSUE. AND GIVEN THE THREAT TO

02:31:40.324 --> 02:31:42.660
PUBLIC SAFETY FROM GUN VIOLENCE

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:43.894
THE ADMINISTRATION PLACED AT

02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:45.796
THE STATE MUST UPDATE ITS LAWS.

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.364
TO ADDRESS LOOPHOLES IN THE

02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:48.065
LONGER WAITING TO THE

02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:49.633
GOVERNMENT'S SPECIAL WEAPONS. I

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.068
WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW PEOPLE TO

02:31:51.135 --> 02:31:53.237
POSSESS WEAPONS THAT HAD ALL

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:54.004
THE MAJOR FEATURES AND

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:54.972
CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSAULT

02:31:55.039 --> 02:31:57.074
WEAPONS. BUT SIMPLY DO NOT FALL

02:31:57.141 --> 02:31:58.542
UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:02.046
DEFINITIONS. ENACTED BY THE

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:02.580
LEGISLATURE. WE KNOW FROM

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:04.048
EXPERIENCE HOW PEOPLE CAN HAVE

02:32:04.114 --> 02:32:05.483
BABIES RESTRICTIONS IN CURRENT

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:07.985
LAW WITH VERY DEADLY RESULTS.

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:09.820
AND SO THIS BILL THIS TRAILER

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:11.322
BILL WOULD EXPAND THE

02:32:11.388 --> 02:32:12.723
DEFINITION OF AN ASSAULT WEAPON

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:13.924
TWIN CLOTHING EVEN THOSE

02:32:13.991 --> 02:32:15.092
WEAPONS THAT DO NOT SET THE

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:17.361
TYPICAL DEFINITION. OF A RIFLE

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:19.497
OR A PISTOL OR SHOCK ON. THAT

02:32:19.563 --> 02:32:20.598
WOULD FALL UNDER THE CURRENT

02:32:20.664 --> 02:32:22.800
BANNER RESULT WEAPON. THIS

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:26.770
INCLUDES CERTAIN FIREARMS. THAT

02:32:26.837 --> 02:32:27.338
DO NOT HAVE A FIXED MAGAZINE

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:27.938
BUT STILL UNDER CURRENT LAW.

02:32:28.005 --> 02:32:29.039
MAY NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:30.407
ASSAULT WEAPONS. IT ALSO

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:31.909
INCLUDES CERTAIN FIREARMS THAT

02:32:31.976 --> 02:32:33.511
YOU HAD A FIX MAGAZINE BUT NONE

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:35.312
THE LESS DISPLAY OTHER FEATURES

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:36.213
CHARACTERISTIC OF ASSAULT

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.182
WEAPONS. INCLUDING A SEMI

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:40.351
AUTOMATIC CENTERFIRE FIREARMS

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:41.418
THAT IS NOT A RIFLE NOT A

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:43.354
PISTOL NOT A SHOT GUN. BUT THAT

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:44.622
HAS A FIX MAGAZINE WITH THE

02:32:44.688 --> 02:32:45.923
CAPACITY TO ACCEPT MORE THAN

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.558
TEN ROUNDS. SO THIS IS ONE

02:32:47.625 --> 02:32:49.226
EXAMPLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THIS

02:32:49.293 --> 02:32:50.561
IS AN URGENT PUBLIC SAFETY

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:52.229
ISSUE. LET ME TURN OVER TO MY

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:55.933
COLLEAGUE HERE NETWORKS WHO CAN

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.868
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

WELL GOOD EVENING- ERIN EDWARDS

PROVIDE SOME FURTHER DETAIL- ON

02:33:06.744 --> 02:33:08.112
THIS ISSUE- AND WHY WE THINK

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:10.214
IT'S REALLY A CRITICAL- PUBLIC

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:11.749

POSSIBLE- SO I THINK IT'S

02:33:20.591 --> 02:33:22.092
HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

02:33:22.159 --> 02:33:24.395
BIT OF. BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW

02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:26.297
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN HAS

02:33:26.363 --> 02:33:27.498
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN CURRENT

02:33:27.565 --> 02:33:29.733
STATUTE- IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.769
WHY THERE IS AN EXISTING LOCAL

02:33:31.835 --> 02:33:33.237
THAT WE- FEEL THE NEED TO

02:33:33.304 --> 02:33:35.539
CLOSE- SO IN PEOPLE CODE

02:33:35.606 --> 02:33:37.841
SECTION THREE ZERO. FIVE ONE

ASSAULT WEAPONS IN EXISTING

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:11.775
LAW- HOWEVER THAT THAT ISN'T

02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:14.011
SUFFICIENT- TO ENSURE THAT

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:17.948
THERE ARE. NO ASSAULT WEAPONS-

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:20.484
BEING- SOLD IN CALIFORNIA

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:23.287
BECAUSE- WE KNOW THAT OF COURSE

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.922
THERE ARE NEW FIREARM SYSTEMS

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:26.991
BEING. DEVELOPED AND PUT ON THE

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:31.228
MARKET- CONSTANTLY- AND SO- IT

02:34:31.295 --> 02:34:32.563
RECOGNIZING THAT THE

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:34.632
LEGISLATURE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:38.369
DEFINE. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

FEATURES THAT. ARE ARE PRESENT

IN ASSAULT WEAPONS- WHICH-

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:47.344
WHICH- WHICH ARE ALSO-

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:52.149
PROHIBITED. UNDER THE ASSAULT

WEAPONS BAN SO. I THAT'S IN SEX

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:55.653
THREE TRANSACTION THREE EASIER.

02:34:55.719 --> 02:34:58.722
FIVE ONE FIVE- THAT IS THIS

02:34:58.789 --> 02:35:00.457
SOME EXAMPLES THAT ARE. THERE

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:04.662
ARE NUMBER- BUT- THE KEY IS IN

02:35:04.728 --> 02:35:06.964
ORDER TO- FALL UNDER THE

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:09.800
DEFINITION OF ASSAULT WEAPON

02:35:09.867 --> 02:35:11.035
UNDER THAT PENAL CODE SECTION.

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:13.671
THE FIRE ON NEEDS TO BE DEFINED

02:35:13.737 --> 02:35:16.707
EITHER AS A PISTOL A RIFLE OR

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:19.343
SHOTGUN. AND IT HAS TO HAVE

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:21.011
SOME SOME ADDITIONAL AFTER

02:35:21.078 --> 02:35:23.414
YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE- FOLDING

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:26.283
OR TELESCOPING. STOCKS A

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:28.218
GRENADE LAUNCHER A FLASH

SUPPRESSOR AFFORD PISTOL GRANT-

02:35:32.322 --> 02:35:34.124
FROM HOLD STOCKS I WILL READ

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:35.826
YOU THE ENTIRE SECTION BUT BUT

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:39.363
YOU GET THE IDEA- I THINK AND

02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:42.499
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE

02:35:42.566 --> 02:35:44.234
ARESOME MANUFACTURERS THAT

02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:46.370
HAVE. DELIBERATELY ATTEMPTED TO

02:35:46.437 --> 02:35:50.340
UNDERMINE- ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS

02:35:50.407 --> 02:35:53.477
BAN BY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNING

02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:56.380
WEAPONS THAT DO NOT FALL INTO

02:35:56.447 --> 02:35:58.048
THE CATEGORY OF A RIFLE A

02:35:58.115 --> 02:36:00.150
PISTOL OR SHOCK ON IN THE US

02:36:00.217 --> 02:36:01.852
ARE NOT. AFFECTED BY THE

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:04.054
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THIS IS

02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:06.590
WHAT I CENTER SKINNER SPOKE TO-

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:11.462
EARLIER- IN SO- THERE ARE- AS I

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:13.564
SAID. THE TICKET WHERE

02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:16.366
MANUFACTURER HAS PUBLICLY

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:17.401
STATED THAT THE DESIGN A

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:20.170
WEAPON- THAT IS DELIBERATELY

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.072
INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT THE

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:25.109
DEFINITIONS AND SAW WEAPON-

02:36:25.175 --> 02:36:26.210
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND I

02:36:26.276 --> 02:36:30.047
THINK- IF THE FOR YOU SEE WHAT

02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:31.281
THIS WEAPON LOOKS LIKE YOU YOU

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:33.183
WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT

02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:34.084
APPEARS TO BE AN ASSAULT

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:36.653
WEAPON- BY. A REASONABLE

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.325
DEFINITION- THE WEAPON IN

02:36:41.391 --> 02:36:42.559
PARTICULAR IS CALLED THE

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:44.762
FRANKLIN ARMORY IN TITLE ONE IF

02:36:44.828 --> 02:36:47.030
YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT ARE ON

02:36:47.097 --> 02:36:48.332
YOUR PHONES I THINK- NOW

02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:49.767
PICTURES WERE THOUSAND WORDS IN

02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:52.369
TERMS OF- REPRESENTING WHAT

02:36:52.436 --> 02:36:54.805
SORT OF WEAPON WE'RE TRYING TO-

02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:56.273
GET OUT WITH THIS WITH THIS

02:36:56.340 --> 02:37:01.445
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE- THE- THE-

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.747
MANUFACTURER AS I SAID HAS HAS

02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:05.616
BEEN ATTEMPTING TO SELL THIS

02:37:05.682 --> 02:37:14.458
WEAPON- IN CALIFORNIA- AND-

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:15.058
DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT THE-

02:37:15.125 --> 02:37:15.692
IT. WOULD FOR UNDER ANY REASON

02:37:15.759 --> 02:37:17.628
DEFINITE OF THE SONG WEAPON.

02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:18.195
THE WAY THEY HAVE A TIME TO

02:37:18.262 --> 02:37:19.963
START THE LAW IS BY DECIDING

02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.031
THAT WEAPONS. BUT IT'S EXACTLY

02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:22.666
SIXTEEN AND- ARE IN CURRENT LAW

02:37:22.733 --> 02:37:26.069
PISTOL IT IS DEFINED AS A

02:37:26.136 --> 02:37:27.571
WEAPON THAT'S LESS THAN SIXTEEN

02:37:27.638 --> 02:37:28.238
INCHES SO IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A

02:37:28.305 --> 02:37:30.607
PISTOL. YEAH AND IT'S NOT

02:37:30.674 --> 02:37:33.277
CONSIDERED A RIFLE IN PART

02:37:33.343 --> 02:37:35.445
BECAUSE IT HAS A BUFFER TO-

02:37:35.512 --> 02:37:38.549
INSTEAD OF A SHOULDER RAST THAT

02:37:38.615 --> 02:37:39.283
SITS AGAINST HIS SHOULDER ONCE

02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:42.419
FIRE- AND SO THEREFORE IT DOES

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.421
NOT. WELL IT'S SORT OF A HYBRID

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:46.056
SOME PEOPLE CALL THIS A FULL

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:48.058
ODDS ACROSS BETWEEN A RIFLE AND

02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:49.493
PISTOL BUT AGAIN I'M NOT

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:54.031
COVERED BY EXISTING LAW- IN SO-

02:37:54.097 --> 02:37:57.868
IN ORDER TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE

02:37:57.935 --> 02:37:59.636
WE HAVE PRESENT THIS THIS THIS

02:37:59.703 --> 02:38:01.772
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WHICH

02:38:01.839 --> 02:38:03.640
WAS THE BULLS PROHIBIT THE SALE

02:38:03.707 --> 02:38:07.010
OF THAT SPECIFIC WEAPON- AS

02:38:07.077 --> 02:38:08.846
WELL AS OTHER WEAPONS WHICH

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:11.515
MANUFACTURES MADE ATTEMPTS

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:12.916
DESIGN BASED ON HISTORY NOW WE

02:38:12.983 --> 02:38:15.219
KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENS TO GET

02:38:15.285 --> 02:38:17.521
AROUND OUR EXISTING STATUTES-

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:19.623
AND SO THAT IS THE SPECIFIC

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:20.824
LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THE-

02:38:20.891 --> 02:38:24.094
SECTION- THREE ZERO FIVE ONE

02:38:24.161 --> 02:38:26.563
FIVE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING- I

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:27.731
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO WE-

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:30.367
INCLUDE AN EXCEPTION- IN THERE

02:38:30.434 --> 02:38:31.602
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:34.705
PURCHASED- FOR OF ENTERTAIN IN

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:38.242
SOME WAY THESE WEAPONS- BEFORE-

02:38:38.308 --> 02:38:40.410
THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THIS OF

02:38:40.477 --> 02:38:42.045
THIS SIZE. OF THIS NEW

02:38:42.112 --> 02:38:44.481
DEFINITION IN ORDER TO ADDRESS

02:38:44.548 --> 02:38:46.016
A SECOND AMENDMENT CONCERNS

02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:47.417
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WITH

02:38:47.484 --> 02:38:48.886
THE WAY THAT THE INITIAL

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:51.054
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS WAS

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:53.891
IMPLEMENTED IN STATE LAW- THE

02:38:53.957 --> 02:38:55.525
REASON THERE'S AN URGENCY TO DO

02:38:55.592 --> 02:38:59.663
THIS NOW. IS BECAUSE- AT THE

02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:01.498
RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA GUN

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:02.633
DEALERS ARE NOT SELLING THESE

02:39:02.699 --> 02:39:05.035
WEAPONS- FOR THE MOST PART

02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:07.571
BECAUSE- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:11.475
NO ONE IS ONLY. ACTUALLY

02:39:11.541 --> 02:39:16.847
BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T FALL INTO.

02:39:16.914 --> 02:39:18.916
OF THE US THREE CATEGORIES

02:39:18.982 --> 02:39:21.785
RIFLE OR COME IN IN ORDER TO

02:39:21.852 --> 02:39:23.453
AVOID. THE DEALERS ARE SIGNED

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.223
WEAPONS AND THEY I THE MAIN IF

02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:28.058

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:30.794
TO THE DEPARTMENT AND- HILL I

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:36.300
CLARIFY IT SYSTEMS TO MAKE IT.

02:39:36.366 --> 02:39:36.900
ALL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM

02:39:36.967 --> 02:39:40.070
TO BE SO THAT'S IN CALIFORNIA-

02:39:40.137 --> 02:39:42.639
AND SO IF THAT HAPPENS- WE

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:44.741
COLD SEE THESE WEAPONS START

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:45.676
TO BE INSTALLED IN LARGE

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:48.078
NUMBERS- IN THEIR IT AGAIN IS A

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.680
SENSE OF URGENCY BECAUSE OF

02:39:49.746 --> 02:39:51.715
THAT THE NEED. UNDER THE SECOND

02:39:51.782 --> 02:39:53.951
AMENDMENT CONSIDERATION TO THE

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:56.086
GRANDFATHER FOLKS IN WHO

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:58.722
ALREADY POSSESS THESE WEAPONS-

02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:01.124
THE THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE

02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:02.459
WALK LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE

02:40:02.526 --> 02:40:03.660
INDIVIDUALS MAY BE ABLE TO

02:40:03.727 --> 02:40:06.129
OBTAIN THESE WEAPONS- BEFORE

02:40:06.196 --> 02:40:08.699
THE- THE PROHIBITION GOES AND

02:40:08.765 --> 02:40:11.068
LESS- SO I THINK I THINK THAT

02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:14.304
KIND OF. SUMMARIZES WHERE WE'RE

02:40:14.371 --> 02:40:16.573
COMING FROM IN TERMS OF- WHY WE

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.309
THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT-

02:40:19.376 --> 02:40:21.411
WE YES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:23.046
THESE WEAPONS ARE ON THE STREET

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:24.047
WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A

02:40:24.114 --> 02:40:26.283
PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT- IN WE

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:28.185
FEEL THAT THERE IS AN URGENCY.

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:30.654
TO ACT NOW- SO I APPRECIATE THE

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:32.422
OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE MORE MORE

CLARITY ON WHAT EXACTLY WHERE

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.559
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE

02:40:35.625 --> 02:40:36.727
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING

02:40:36.793 --> 02:40:39.129
INSTITUTIONAL. DETAILS EARLIER

WHAT HE- SAID WHICH YOU GOOD.

02:40:53.377 --> 02:40:55.212

ASSOCIATION'S AND OTHER GUN

02:41:01.752 --> 02:41:04.488
RIGHTS GROUPS BASICALLY PRO

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:07.958
CLAIMING IT AS A- LEGAL ASSAULT

EXPLICIT THAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS

02:41:14.031 --> 02:41:15.932
TO CREATE AN ASSAULT WEAPON.

02:41:15.999 --> 02:41:18.935
THAT COULD DEFY OUR LAW. BEYOND

02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.737

THEY'RE BACK IN THE COMMUNITY

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:47.784
NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A WEAPON.

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:50.887
WE WERE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND.

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:52.489
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS NOW THAT

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:55.392
DOESN'T MEAN. TWENTY THOUSAND

02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:57.894
GUNS. BECAUSE VERY FEW WOULD

02:43:57.961 --> 02:44:01.031
ONLY HAVE ONE. BUT FOR YEARS

02:44:01.097 --> 02:44:02.365
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID

02:44:02.432 --> 02:44:05.368
NOTHING ABOUT IT. AND THEN WE

KIND OF FUSSED WITH THEM A

02:44:05.969 --> 02:44:08.071

MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN I

02:44:15.779 --> 02:44:18.014
NEVER GOT CLEANED UP I MEAN THE

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:21.418

TODAY THIS IS GREAT. I DID HAVE

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:45.621
A QUESTION ON THE ON THE- SO

02:57:45.688 --> 02:57:46.789
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:49.291
HELPING PARTICIPATE IN- THE SIX

02:57:49.358 --> 02:57:51.160
HUNDRED PER WEEK I BELIEVE IN.

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:54.230
IS FOUR FIFTY FOUR. THE STATE-

02:57:54.296 --> 02:57:55.798
IF I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

02:57:55.865 --> 02:57:57.466
EMPLOYERS TO ONE OF THEIR

02:57:57.533 --> 02:57:58.234
EMPLOYEES TO COME BACK TO WORK

02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:00.102
BUT THEY'RE- MAKING MORE MONEY

02:58:00.169 --> 02:58:02.338
ON UNEMPLOYMENT WITH THE DUAL-

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:06.776
BENEFITS. IF YOU'VE OFFERED

02:58:06.842 --> 02:58:07.877
YOUR JOB BACK AND THEY DON'T

02:58:07.943 --> 02:58:10.179
ACCEPT IT AND THEIR REPORTED

02:58:10.246 --> 02:58:10.679
THEN DO THEY LOSE THOSE

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:19.555
BENEFITS. YEAH CHRIS COOK WITH

02:58:19.622 --> 02:58:22.124
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL. I

02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:23.859
CAN'T SAY FOR SURE WHETHER OR

02:58:23.926 --> 02:58:24.560
NOT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR

02:58:24.627 --> 02:58:26.529
BENEFITS BUT DEFINITELY IF

02:58:26.595 --> 02:58:27.830
SOMEONE IS OFFERED THEIR JOB

02:58:27.897 --> 02:58:29.565
BACK THEN THEY SHOULD BE

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:30.900
REPORTING BACK TO WORK AND

02:58:30.966 --> 02:58:34.070
THEN- BY THEM BEING ELIGIBLE

02:58:34.136 --> 02:58:35.371
FOR THAT JOB THEY SHOULD NOT

02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:36.305
THEY SHOULD NO LONGER BE

02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:37.540
ELIGIBLE FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT

02:58:37.606 --> 02:58:39.742
BENEFITS BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO

02:58:39.809 --> 02:58:42.711
BE SOME- I THINK IT A LOT OF IT

02:58:42.778 --> 02:58:44.080
IS CONTINGENT UPON THE AGREE

02:58:44.146 --> 02:58:45.548
ABOUT. HOW THEY WERE RELEASED

02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:47.583
WITH THEIR- WITH THEIR EMPLOYER

02:58:47.650 --> 02:58:48.951
IF THEY WERE LATE LATE OFTEN

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:49.618
THEY RECEIVED A SEVERANCE

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:52.321
PACKAGE- THEN DEFINITELY YOU

02:58:52.388 --> 02:58:54.523
KNOW THERE'S NO CERTAINTY THAT

02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:55.858
THEY THEY SHOULD BE REPORTING

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:57.493
BACK TO WORK BUT IF THERE WAS

02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:59.061
SOME AGREEMENT TO BE IF IT WAS

02:58:59.128 --> 02:59:03.132
A- AND- A MOMENTARILY LOOK LIKE

02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:04.600
A ENTER I'M WAY OFF WHERE THEY

02:59:04.667 --> 02:59:06.469
STILL RETAIN THE ELIGIBILITY

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:07.903
FOR THEIR JOB AND THEN THEY

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:10.940
SHOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO

02:59:11.006 --> 02:59:11.574
THEIR EMPLOYER AT THAT POINT IN

02:59:11.640 --> 02:59:12.408
TIME. IT WOULD IT WOULD BE VERY

02:59:12.475 --> 02:59:13.042
HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME

02:59:13.109 --> 02:59:14.944
CLARIFICATION BECAUSE- THE

02:59:15.010 --> 02:59:16.412
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S.

02:59:16.479 --> 02:59:17.513
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THROUGH

OR THE IS. IT IS QUITE HIGH AND

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:24.620
IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE

02:59:24.687 --> 02:59:27.289
STATE- THIS LIKE A THOUSAND

02:59:27.356 --> 02:59:29.091
DOLLARS A WEEK. AND I KNOW

02:59:29.158 --> 02:59:32.995
THAT- MANY EMPLOYERS TO. OR

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:34.330
TRYING TO GET BACK TO WORK

02:59:34.396 --> 02:59:35.831
THERE PLEASE DON'T WANT TO COME

02:59:35.898 --> 02:59:37.500
BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THE ACTION

02:59:37.566 --> 02:59:38.134
MAKING MORE MONEY WHEN THEY'RE

02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:40.035
NOT EMPLOYED. THEN WHEN THEY

02:59:40.102 --> 02:59:41.504
WOULD BE EMPLOYED SO THAT'S

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:45.674
BECAUSE SOME OF THE- CONFLICT-

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:47.143
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO

02:59:47.209 --> 02:59:56.619

WHAT I SAID BILLION SO YEAH

03:00:33.155 --> 03:00:36.091
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE

03:00:36.158 --> 03:00:36.926
BORROWED. FROM THE FEDERAL

03:00:36.992 --> 03:00:38.627

WERE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION

03:00:55.544 --> 03:00:57.346
I SHOULD ADD THAT FEDERAL

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:59.548
LEGISLATION. THE END OF THIS

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:01.450
CALENDAR YEAR I DOES NOT

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:03.619
REQUIRE INTERESTS TO BE PAID ON

03:01:03.686 --> 03:01:05.287
THAT BORROWING AT LEAST NOT

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:06.889
UNTIL NEXT YEAR AND THE

03:01:06.956 --> 03:01:09.191
GOVERNOR HAS PETITIONS- OUR

03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:11.026
PARTNERS IN CONGRESS TO EXTEND

THAT DEADLINE POSSIBLE. AND DO

03:01:15.297 --> 03:01:15.798
WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE BORROWED

03:01:15.864 --> 03:01:17.833
TODAY. LET ME TURN OVER TO

03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:19.235
CHRIS KIRKER WE MAY NOT HAVE

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:21.237
THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AT HAND

03:01:21.303 --> 03:01:23.672
TO. LET ME TALK WITH CHRIS.

03:01:23.739 --> 03:01:25.841
YEAH CHRIS CHRIS COOK WITH

03:01:25.908 --> 03:01:26.475
DEPARTMENT FINANCE CENTER MORE

03:01:26.542 --> 03:01:28.544
LIKE THAT. TO BE EXACT I

03:01:28.611 --> 03:01:30.212
BELIEVE EARLIER THIS WEEK WE

03:01:30.279 --> 03:01:32.915
HAD ISSUED SINCE MARCH I WANT

03:01:32.982 --> 03:01:34.149
TO SAY IT WAS AROUND THIRTY SIX

03:01:34.216 --> 03:01:35.384
BILLION IN BENEFITS. THROUGH

03:01:35.451 --> 03:01:37.853
THE U. I. PROGRAM AND AS FOR

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:39.288
MARLENE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:40.856
THAT WE HAVE BECOME FAR AWAY

03:01:40.923 --> 03:01:41.991
AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S

03:01:42.057 --> 03:01:47.096
APPROXIMATELY. AROUND. TWO TO

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:47.963
THREE BILLION DOLLARS HER. BUT

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:49.732
THAT NUMBER FLUCTUATES DAILY

03:01:49.798 --> 03:01:52.635
BASED ON INCOMING RECEIPTS OF-

03:01:52.701 --> 03:01:55.237
OF- YOU AYE PAYMENTS FROM

03:01:55.304 --> 03:01:57.506
EMPLOYERS AND THEN HOW MUCH

03:01:57.573 --> 03:01:57.973
WE'RE PAYING OUT SO IT

03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:00.142
FLUCTUATES. SO THEN A DO WE

03:02:00.209 --> 03:02:03.445
HAVE A PAYMENT PLAN WILL. WOOD

03:02:03.512 --> 03:02:05.080
IT TOOK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:02:05.147 --> 03:02:07.750
QUITE A LONG TIME- WITH THE

03:02:07.816 --> 03:02:09.985
GREAT RECESSION TO PAY OFF- THE

03:02:10.052 --> 03:02:12.187
FEDERAL LOAN WE HAD LIKE A TEN

03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:13.455
BILLION DOLLAR BALANCE FOR A

03:02:13.522 --> 03:02:17.626
NUMBER OF YEARS. AND SINCE

03:02:17.693 --> 03:02:18.994
BUSINESSES WERE FORCED TO PAY A

03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:22.197
HIGHER FUTA TAX EVERY DECEMBER

03:02:22.264 --> 03:02:23.098
TO PAY IT DOWN TO THE FEDERAL

03:02:23.165 --> 03:02:25.934
GOVERNMENT I'M I'M WONDERING IS

03:02:26.001 --> 03:02:28.704
THAT GOING TO OCCUR AGAIN. SO

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:30.673
WHAT I'LL SAY TO THAT IS THAT

03:02:30.739 --> 03:02:32.141
WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT'S

03:02:32.207 --> 03:02:33.309
GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE

03:02:33.375 --> 03:02:35.311
BUT- AS YOU KNOW SENATOR MORE

03:02:35.377 --> 03:02:37.680
LOCK WE'RE SEEING HISTORICALLY.

03:02:37.746 --> 03:02:39.248
HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE

03:02:39.315 --> 03:02:41.116
ARE ALREADY WELL ABOVE THE HE

03:02:41.183 --> 03:02:42.885
GOT EMPLOYMENT THAT WE SAW IN

03:02:42.951 --> 03:02:44.119
THE GREAT RECESSION AND OF

03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:45.621
COURSE THAT'S THE SISTERS

03:02:45.688 --> 03:02:46.689
STATISTIC THAT IS DIRECTLY

03:02:46.755 --> 03:02:48.724
DRIVING- THESE REQUESTS FOR

03:02:48.791 --> 03:02:51.560
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THEN

03:02:51.627 --> 03:02:53.362
HE- SOME FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S.

03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:54.863
GENERALLY THE WAY THE SYSTEM

03:02:54.930 --> 03:02:56.832
WORKS RIGHT NOW IS THAT AS YOU

03:02:56.899 --> 03:02:58.901
NOTED. BUSINESS IS A PAIN TO

03:02:58.967 --> 03:03:01.236
THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM- WOULD

03:03:01.303 --> 03:03:03.272
HAVE TO PAY. FOR THE PRINCIPLE

03:03:03.339 --> 03:03:05.074
OF THE LOAN OVER TIME AS WHAT

03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:05.574
HAPPENED WITH THE GREAT

03:03:05.641 --> 03:03:07.376
RECESSION. AND THE GENERAL

03:03:07.443 --> 03:03:09.878
FUND- IS OFTEN ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:03:09.945 --> 03:03:11.146
THE INTEREST RATES ALTHOUGH AS

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:13.282
NECESSARY- THAT EXAM SO WE FOR

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:14.817
THE REST OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

03:03:14.883 --> 03:03:16.819
HOWEVER WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE

03:03:16.885 --> 03:03:17.786
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

03:03:17.853 --> 03:03:19.254
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR WEEKS

03:03:19.321 --> 03:03:21.557
ACROSS ALL AREAS AND SPOKE FOR

03:03:21.623 --> 03:03:23.392
BUSINESSES AND FOR THE STATE

03:03:23.459 --> 03:03:24.426
BUDGET THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:27.463
THEM THAT. WE HOPE THAT THEY

03:03:27.529 --> 03:03:27.963
ARE INTERESTED AND- WILL

03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:29.331
HAPPENS BE ONE OF THOSE OFF

03:03:29.398 --> 03:03:31.734
BALANCE SHEET. LOU LOANS THAT

03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:34.970
SOMEHOW FALLS INTO THE PURVIEW

03:03:35.037 --> 03:03:36.238
OF. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AYE

03:03:36.305 --> 03:03:38.273
AYE SIR MEMBER GETTING HERE AND

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.209
HAVING A CALL. IN DECEMBER FROM

03:03:40.275 --> 03:03:43.112
A BUSINESS OWNER. WHO WAS JUST

03:03:43.178 --> 03:03:44.513
BESIDE HERSELF BECAUSE SHE JUST

03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:46.548

AND FORMER DECEMBER JANUARY

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:56.191
THAT- THE STATE STILL OWED

03:03:56.258 --> 03:03:57.426
MONEY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:03:57.493 --> 03:03:58.761
SO SHE HAD TO PAY A HIGHER RATE

03:03:58.827 --> 03:03:59.828
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE SAID MY

03:03:59.895 --> 03:04:02.297
GOODNESS I GOTTA PAY. FOUR

03:04:02.364 --> 03:04:03.098
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I WASN'T

PREPARED TO NOW I CAN'T PAY MY

03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.002
CHRISTMAS BONUSES AND I HANDLE

03:04:07.069 --> 03:04:08.737
THE BUSINESS OWNER OF A DEAR

03:04:08.804 --> 03:04:10.506
LADY ON THE PHONE CRYING ACT.

03:04:10.572 --> 03:04:11.607
SO WHEN ARE WE GOING TO

03:04:11.673 --> 03:04:13.409
COMMUNICATE TO OUR BUSINESS

03:04:13.475 --> 03:04:15.844
COMMUNITY THAT THEY MAY BE

03:04:15.911 --> 03:04:17.913
SUBJECT TO A MUCH HIGHER. FUTA

03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:19.915
TAX WHEN- THAT ROLLS AROUND IN

03:04:19.982 --> 03:04:21.750
DECEMBER JANUARY OF THIS YEAR

03:04:21.817 --> 03:04:24.353
WHEN THEY'RE READY. YOU KNOW OP

03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:26.121
BUCKLING AT THE KNEES IF

03:04:26.188 --> 03:04:28.090
THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS. SO

03:04:28.157 --> 03:04:29.925
GENERALLY IT HAPPENS ON A

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:32.394
SPECIFIED TIME LINE ON THAT IT

03:04:32.461 --> 03:04:34.530
DOESN'T RAPIDLY RISE-

03:04:34.596 --> 03:04:36.331
IMMEDIATELY RATHER IT SCALES UP

03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:37.966
OVER TIME SO THERE IS SOME

03:04:38.033 --> 03:04:39.902
PREDICTABILITY. BUT LET ME TURN

03:04:39.968 --> 03:04:41.804
IT OVER TO CHRIS WHO CAN TALK A

03:04:46.675 --> 03:04:48.243
THE FOOD ATTACKS ACTUALLY

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:50.145
DOESN'T TAKE A FACT ONLY WHEN

03:04:50.212 --> 03:04:51.880
THERE IS- TWO YEARS THAT THE

03:04:51.947 --> 03:04:54.183
STATE HAD DIED THE STATE'S YOU

03:04:54.249 --> 03:04:56.585
WHY. BALANCE IS INSOLVENT AND

03:04:56.652 --> 03:04:59.788
SO FOR EXAMPLE- AT THE POINT IN

03:04:59.855 --> 03:05:01.924
WHICH THE- THEY WERE IN SOLVE

03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:04.293
IT NOW THE AFFECT OF THAT-

03:05:04.359 --> 03:05:05.928
THEIR TAX MORE INCREASE FOR TWO

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:07.329
MORE YEARS SO REALISTICALLY

03:05:07.396 --> 03:05:09.565
WE'RE LOOKING AT. MAYBE FISCAL

03:05:09.631 --> 03:05:11.700
YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:14.303
UNTIL- IS WHEN THE ACTUAL TAX

03:05:14.369 --> 03:05:14.803
WILL INCREASE FOR THOSE

03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:16.905
EMPLOYERS SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO

03:05:16.972 --> 03:05:18.774
MONITOR AND THAT WILL ALL BE

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:20.409
BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE

03:05:20.476 --> 03:05:21.877
STATE IS BORROWING AN-

03:05:21.944 --> 03:05:23.378
ABSOLUTELY WILL BE.

03:05:23.445 --> 03:05:25.080
UNEMPLOYMENT IS CATENA RICE

03:05:25.147 --> 03:05:27.216
THAT WILL BE BORROWED THE MORE-

03:05:27.282 --> 03:05:28.517
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

03:05:28.584 --> 03:05:30.719
EMPLOYERS WILL BE KNOWN- WILL

03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:32.988
KNOW ABOUT THIS INCREASE- I

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:35.090
WOULD ALSO ADD AS WELL IS THAT

03:05:35.157 --> 03:05:36.425
THIS TRAILER BILL IS PROVIDING

03:05:36.492 --> 03:05:38.393
SOME LIMITED SUPPORT. FOR THOSE

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:40.696
SMALL BUSINESSES IN THAT DAY-

03:05:40.762 --> 03:05:42.231
THEIR EXPERIENCE RATING IS NOT

03:05:42.297 --> 03:05:44.132
GOING TO BE AFFECTED AND SO AS

03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:45.434
A CONDITION OF RECEIPT OF SOME

03:05:45.501 --> 03:05:48.504
OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS- THAT.

03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:49.771
ONE OF THE CONDITIONS WISE IS

03:05:49.838 --> 03:05:51.039
THE STATE I SHOULD BE HOLDING

03:05:51.106 --> 03:05:52.741
THOSE- SMALL BUSINESSES

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:54.743
HARMLESS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR

03:05:54.810 --> 03:05:56.545
EXPERIENCE RATING AND SO WHAT

03:05:56.612 --> 03:05:58.780
THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY- THEIR

03:05:58.847 --> 03:06:00.115
EXPERIENCE RATING OR HOW MUCH

03:06:00.182 --> 03:06:02.084
THEY PAY INTO THE U. I. FUND.

03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:05.020
IS IN PART BASED UPON HOW MANY

03:06:05.087 --> 03:06:06.822
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF

03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:08.624
AT THEIR BUSINESS. AND BECAUSE

03:06:08.690 --> 03:06:10.425

03:06:12.628 --> 03:06:13.962
BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

03:06:19.701 --> 03:06:23.672
IMPACTS OF THEIR. EXPERIENCE

03:06:23.739 --> 03:06:24.239

FROM THOSE TAXES SO IT'S NOT A

03:16:57.305 --> 03:16:59.240
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH ALL

03:16:59.307 --> 03:17:02.777
FORMS OF RENEWABLES SO SOLAR

03:17:02.844 --> 03:17:05.213

PROVIDE THIS WOULD BE A TAX

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:19.427
EITHER SO I AM I'M MY QUESTION

03:17:19.494 --> 03:17:24.599
TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES

03:17:24.666 --> 03:17:25.233
IS WHY IS THIS BILL IN HERE AND

03:17:25.300 --> 03:17:26.901
WHAT. I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE GONNA

03:17:26.968 --> 03:17:30.772
IT WE HAVE A SPLIT ROLE COMING-UP. BUT DID A WORD OF WARNING A

03:17:30.838 --> 03:17:33.875
BUDGET. DEFICIT AND WE TALK

03:17:33.942 --> 03:17:35.743
ABOUT REVENUES THIS IS ONE

03:17:35.810 --> 03:17:37.178
PLACE WHERE I BELIEVE AS A

03:17:37.245 --> 03:17:39.847
REPUBLICAN. WE SHOULD LEVEL THE

03:17:39.914 --> 03:17:40.848
PLAYING FIELD AND MAKE THEM PAY

03:17:40.915 --> 03:17:42.750
THEIR FAIR SHARE ON THE

03:17:42.817 --> 03:17:44.953
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S PUT IN.

03:17:45.019 --> 03:17:47.755
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A WIN PERSON

03:17:47.822 --> 03:17:50.225
OR YOUR- OR YOUR OTHER TYPES OF

03:17:50.291 --> 03:17:51.759
RENEWABLES THEY DON'T ENJOY

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:54.796
THIS SAME. A BENEFIT AND SO

03:17:54.862 --> 03:17:56.331
IT'S REALLY NOT LEVEL AND IT'S

03:17:56.397 --> 03:17:57.565
PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN

03:17:57.632 --> 03:17:59.367
THE RENEWABLES SOMETHING I'VE

03:17:59.434 --> 03:18:01.302
BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH FOR A LONG

03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:02.337
TIME IF IT'S ABOUT SAVING THE

03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:03.838
ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD PAY

03:18:03.905 --> 03:18:06.274
THEIR FAIR SHARE THE- IN MY

03:18:06.341 --> 03:18:09.043
OPINION THE SOLAR LOBBY IS JUST

03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:10.878
OWN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IT'S

03:18:10.945 --> 03:18:13.448
OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE- SOME OF

03:18:13.514 --> 03:18:14.315
THE ABSURDITIES THAT COME OUT

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:15.917
OF THIS PLACE. WITH THE

03:18:15.984 --> 03:18:17.952
INCENTIVES THAT THEY GET OVER

03:18:18.019 --> 03:18:20.455
OTHER TYPES OF RENEWABLE SO I

03:18:20.521 --> 03:18:21.723
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS IS

03:18:21.789 --> 03:18:23.258
IN THIS BUDGET IT IS A LAST

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:26.594
MINUTE DEAL- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT-

03:18:26.661 --> 03:18:29.364
IN IN IN ITS RETROACTIVE ONLY

03:18:29.430 --> 03:18:31.266
IF. ABOUT INITIATIVE GETS

03:18:31.332 --> 03:18:32.700
PASSED SO THIS IS REALLY

03:18:32.767 --> 03:18:34.736
CONCERNING IN THE PROCESS OF

03:18:34.802 --> 03:18:36.838
HOW WE LEGISLATURE HERE AND I

03:18:36.904 --> 03:18:37.972

03:18:38.039 --> 03:18:39.941
LOSING OUT ON THIS AND THE AND

03:18:40.008 --> 03:18:42.477
THE AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS IN

03:18:42.543 --> 03:18:45.613

03:18:47.982 --> 03:18:49.217
BUT STILL LIKE AN ANSWER FROM

03:18:49.284 --> 03:18:51.586
DHAHRAN THEM ONLINE ASK WHY

03:18:51.653 --> 03:18:54.689
THIS IS IN THE AIR AND WHAT'S

03:18:54.756 --> 03:18:57.525
DRIVING THIS FINANCE. A YES

03:18:57.592 --> 03:18:59.060
CENTER GOLLY I'LL MAKE A COUPLE

03:18:59.127 --> 03:19:01.095
OF BRIEF POINTS- I THINK FIRST

03:19:01.162 --> 03:19:02.897
OF ALL- IS THE FACT AS HE

03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:04.632
MENTIONS THAT THAT THIS

03:19:04.699 --> 03:19:06.267
WOULDN'T GO INTO A FACT UNLESS

03:19:06.334 --> 03:19:07.368
THERE'S SCHOOLS AND RELEASED

03:19:07.435 --> 03:19:09.737
FIRST INITIATIVE. IS ENACTED BY

03:19:09.804 --> 03:19:11.506
THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND

03:19:11.572 --> 03:19:13.808
WHILE I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT

03:19:13.875 --> 03:19:15.476
THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT TAKEN AT

03:19:15.543 --> 03:19:16.811
SPECIFIC POSITION ON THAT

03:19:16.878 --> 03:19:18.880
BALLOT MEASURE AS OF YET- TO

03:19:18.946 --> 03:19:20.515
ADDRESS YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

03:19:20.581 --> 03:19:22.116
FISCAL PRESSURES AND IF THAT

03:19:22.183 --> 03:19:24.018
MEASURE ERE TO BE ENACTED- AND

03:19:24.085 --> 03:19:26.054
THIS PROVISION WORDS TO TAKE A

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:26.988
FACT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

03:19:27.055 --> 03:19:29.424
YEARS ON THERE WOULD BE A NET.

03:19:29.490 --> 03:19:31.659
POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOCAL

03:19:31.726 --> 03:19:33.361
REVENUES AT FOR SCHOOLS ANOTHER

03:19:33.428 --> 03:19:35.296
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO YOUR POINT

03:19:35.363 --> 03:19:36.731
ABOUT NAY SO I'M TAKING REVENUE

03:19:36.798 --> 03:19:38.666
AWAY IN A BUDGET DEFICIT I'M

03:19:38.733 --> 03:19:39.600
WHILE THERE MIGHT THERE WOULD

03:19:39.667 --> 03:19:40.902
BE A REVENUE DECLINE FOR THIS

03:19:40.968 --> 03:19:43.104
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IT WOULD BE

03:19:43.171 --> 03:19:44.205
IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER

03:19:44.272 --> 03:19:46.341
STACKS OF REVENUE INCREASES AND

03:19:46.407 --> 03:19:47.608
I THINK THE BROADER POINT- I

03:19:47.675 --> 03:19:49.477
WILL MAKE IS. AS YOU MENTIONED

03:19:49.544 --> 03:19:50.778
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

03:19:50.845 --> 03:19:53.181
PROVISIONS THAT RELATED TO

03:19:53.247 --> 03:19:54.816
ENERGY- THAT THE MIST VERSION

03:19:54.882 --> 03:19:55.817
OF LEGISLATURE OFTEN DISCUSSED

03:19:55.883 --> 03:19:57.852
TOGETHER- BUT SOLAR AND

03:19:57.919 --> 03:19:59.520
RENEWABLE ENERGY MORE BROADLY-

03:19:59.587 --> 03:20:00.922
IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

03:20:00.988 --> 03:20:02.957

TODAY AS THE YEARS GO BY THOSE

03:20:08.629 --> 03:20:09.397
GOALS BECOME INCREASINGLY

03:20:09.464 --> 03:20:11.065
URGENT- SO THAT'S ANOTHER

03:20:11.132 --> 03:20:12.900
REASON WHY CAN RESULT IT WAS

03:20:12.967 --> 03:20:17.905
IMPORTANT. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

03:20:17.972 --> 03:20:19.273
THIS. TO ALL TAKE THAT AS-

03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:21.342
THEIR GOOD AT GETTING LOBBY IN.

03:20:21.409 --> 03:20:22.043
AND THEIR HEDGING THEIR BETS

03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.844
EVEN IF THE PROPER. SPUR ROLE

03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:25.346
PASS. THIS IS A- THIS IS JUST.

03:20:25.413 --> 03:20:26.914
I CAN'T BELIEVE. WE'RE DOING

03:20:26.981 --> 03:20:29.083
THIS IN A TIME WHERE WE NEED

03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:30.651
REVENUES AND WE NEED TO LEVEL

03:20:30.718 --> 03:20:31.252
THE PLAYING FIELD SO I

03:20:31.319 --> 03:20:33.588
APPRECIATE- THE LONG ANSWER TO

03:20:33.654 --> 03:20:35.957
A SHORT QUESTION. THAT THEY'RE

03:20:36.023 --> 03:20:37.392
JUST AHEAD OF THE GAME ON

03:20:37.458 --> 03:20:39.494
GETTING THEIR POSITION. SO THAT

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:40.928
THEY STILL CONTINUE TO GET A

03:20:40.995 --> 03:20:43.498
BREAK. OVERALL IF THERE'S A

03:20:43.564 --> 03:20:49.103
SPLIT ROLE. SENATOR MORLOCK

03:20:49.170 --> 03:20:51.139
ANOTHER CLARIFICATION FROM

03:20:51.205 --> 03:20:53.341
MISTER VISWANATHA AND CENTER

03:20:53.408 --> 03:20:54.675
DOLLAR BRINGS UP A GREAT POINT

03:20:54.742 --> 03:20:57.745
WE ARE NOW GIVING A TAX BREAK

03:20:57.812 --> 03:20:59.414
BUT IT COMES AT THE COST OF

03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:02.450
COUNTY. GOVERNMENT ARE ARE WE

03:21:02.517 --> 03:21:04.252
THEN GOING TO REIMBURSE THE

03:21:04.318 --> 03:21:06.821
COUNTY FOR THE LOST REVENUE I

03:21:06.888 --> 03:21:08.122
MEAN IT IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO

03:21:08.189 --> 03:21:10.491
CUT DEALS WITH IT DOESN'T

03:21:10.558 --> 03:21:12.126

03:21:14.395 --> 03:21:16.964
SO SURE THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S

03:21:17.031 --> 03:21:19.467
EVEN ETHICAL BUT- I I'M JUST

03:21:19.534 --> 03:21:21.903
CURIOUS IT. WHAT HAPPENS TO

03:21:21.969 --> 03:21:24.272

NOT HAVE CLARIFIED THIS BEFORE

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:34.682
BUT THIS IS A RE ENACTMENT OF

03:21:34.749 --> 03:21:37.452
CURRENT LAW SO THESE PROVISIONS

03:21:37.518 --> 03:21:38.553
AND THE PURPOSES BEHIND THEM

03:21:38.619 --> 03:21:40.822
ARE ALREADY A CURRENT LAW AND

03:21:40.888 --> 03:21:43.424
SO- IF HE INITIATIVES AND ACTED

03:21:43.491 --> 03:21:45.827

EXTENT THAT I. HAD A GROUP

03:37:46.520 --> 03:37:48.588
HEALTH POLICY IN PLACE FOR

03:37:48.655 --> 03:37:49.456
MYSELF AND MY EMPLOYEE I WOULD

03:37:49.523 --> 03:37:52.926
BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE. THE

EMPLOYEE RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT

03:37:58.432 --> 03:38:05.138
OKAY. MEL MY RESEARCH REFLECTS

03:38:05.205 --> 03:38:06.840
THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A

03:38:06.907 --> 03:38:11.478
ONE POINT SIX MILLION EMPLOYERS.

03:38:11.545 --> 03:38:13.113
TEN ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION

03:38:13.180 --> 03:38:15.615
OF THOSE EMPLOYERS HAVE FIVE OR

03:38:15.682 --> 03:38:22.222
FEWER. EMPLOYEES. SO I GUESS MY

03:38:22.289 --> 03:38:24.791
NEXT QUESTION IS WHY WHAT WAS

03:38:24.858 --> 03:38:27.594
WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE. TO TAKE

03:38:27.661 --> 03:38:30.230
THESE WELL ESTABLISHED COVERAGE

03:38:30.297 --> 03:38:32.165
TRACHSEL'S THAT WERE SET

03:38:32.232 --> 03:38:33.366
OBVIOUSLY FOR A REASON AT THE

03:38:33.433 --> 03:38:35.402
TIME THAT THE VERY STATUTES

03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:37.704
WERE ENACTED AND DRAW ALL OF

03:38:37.771 --> 03:38:43.076
THOSE DOWN TO ONE EMPLOYEE.

03:38:43.143 --> 03:38:50.283
YEAH. WE BELIEVE ARM. WE

03:38:50.350 --> 03:38:51.284
BELIEVE PROVIDING THESE THE

03:38:51.351 --> 03:38:53.320
COVERAGE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE

03:38:53.386 --> 03:38:54.821
THE PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR

03:38:54.888 --> 03:38:57.424
THESE INDIVIDUALS- AND THAT

03:38:57.491 --> 03:38:58.625
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

03:38:58.692 --> 03:39:00.060
PAYING INTO IT SHOULD BE

03:39:00.126 --> 03:39:02.128
ENTITLED TO THESE PROTECTIONS

03:39:02.195 --> 03:39:02.729
WELL I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE

03:39:02.796 --> 03:39:04.064
BUT I MEAN WAS THERE SOME

03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:06.199
OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS THAT WENT

03:39:06.266 --> 03:39:08.034
INTO THIS DECISION MAKING

03:39:08.101 --> 03:39:10.136
PROCESS. SOME SERIES OF

03:39:10.203 --> 03:39:12.038
DECISION POINTS THAT YOU

03:39:12.105 --> 03:39:15.509
CONSIDERED AN- DEALT WITH AN

03:39:15.575 --> 03:39:17.344
USED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION

03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:19.579

03:39:19.646 --> 03:39:20.280
LIKE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO

03:39:20.347 --> 03:39:22.916
EVERYONE. RIGHT BUT I WILL SAY

03:39:22.983 --> 03:39:24.417
SENATOR ROBB THAT AT THIS HAS

03:39:24.484 --> 03:39:26.887
BEEN- DISCUSSION THAT- THE

03:39:26.953 --> 03:39:28.021
GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION

03:39:28.088 --> 03:39:29.823
HAS BEEN HAVING- OVER ANY

03:39:29.890 --> 03:39:30.690
MONTHS INCLUDING BOTH IN THE

TASK FORCE AS WELL AS

03:39:32.359 --> 03:39:34.361
CONVERSATION SO I KNOW THERE

03:39:34.427 --> 03:39:35.662
MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

03:39:35.729 --> 03:39:37.898
ON THE OUTCOME- BUT IT WAS NOT

03:39:37.964 --> 03:39:40.200
A ROSS STORE CARE WAS DECISION

03:39:40.267 --> 03:39:41.134

INTO A BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU

03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:53.613
MUST NOT TO BE TOO DISAPPOINTED

03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:54.781
IF WE DEAL WITH THIS AS A

03:39:54.848 --> 03:39:57.017
POLICY ISSUE AND ASK YOU POLICY

03:39:57.083 --> 03:40:01.321

ADMINISTRATION. DO A STUDY OR

03:40:09.329 --> 03:40:11.865
ANALYSIS ON THE IMPACT OF THIS

03:40:11.932 --> 03:40:13.199
RATHER SIGNIFICANT POLICY

03:40:13.266 --> 03:40:15.969

SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. AND I

03:43:37.537 --> 03:43:38.605
DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK AND WHAT

03:43:38.671 --> 03:43:40.173
I FOUND WAS IT'S A FIVE OH ONE

03:43:40.240 --> 03:43:42.876
C. THREE BUT- DO YOU KNOW HOW

03:43:42.942 --> 03:43:44.778
MANY. EMPLOYER MEMBERS. THE

03:43:44.844 --> 03:43:47.647
SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY HAS.

03:43:47.714 --> 03:43:53.820
FINANCE WE DO NOT WAIT I HAVE

03:43:53.887 --> 03:43:56.089
WILL IN FACT IN THE YOU KNOW TO

03:43:56.156 --> 03:43:57.056
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN CONSIDER

03:43:57.123 --> 03:43:58.458
NEWSPAPERS AUTHORITATIVE

03:43:58.525 --> 03:44:00.660
SOURCES ANYMORE THE NEWSPAPER

03:44:00.727 --> 03:44:02.328
REPORTS INDICATE SORT OF

03:44:02.395 --> 03:44:04.664
REFLECTED THERE ARE NO EMPLOYER

OH ONE SEE THREE. OF FUNDED BY

03:44:11.838 --> 03:44:14.240
FOUNDATIONS AND SO I WOULD

03:44:14.307 --> 03:44:16.910
SUGGEST THAT THIS TASK FORCE

03:44:16.976 --> 03:44:20.146
REPORT HAD. VERY LITTLE IF ANY.

03:44:20.213 --> 03:44:21.848
SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATION

03:44:21.915 --> 03:44:23.516
SO IN ADDITION TO IT FOCUSING

03:44:23.583 --> 03:44:25.685
ON THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHICH

03:44:25.752 --> 03:44:27.854
IS NOT THE SORT OF. SECTIONS

03:44:27.921 --> 03:44:30.623
THAT WERE AMENDING. I DON'T

03:44:30.690 --> 03:44:32.091
BELIEVE IN IT DOESN'T REFLECT

03:44:32.158 --> 03:44:34.194
THAT IT HAD ANY SMALL BUSINESS

03:44:34.260 --> 03:44:36.729
REPRESENTATION PROVIDING INPUT

03:44:36.796 --> 03:44:38.832
AS TO THESE RATHER SIGNIFICANT

03:44:38.898 --> 03:44:42.035
CHANGES. WAS THERE ANY OTHER

03:44:42.101 --> 03:44:44.704
STUDY THAT WAS DONE. DID THE

03:44:44.771 --> 03:44:45.939
ADMINISTRATION HAVE ANY OTHER

03:44:46.005 --> 03:44:49.108
CONTACT WITH CALIFORNIA'S SMALL

03:44:49.175 --> 03:44:50.443
BUSINESS CONTENTION TO

03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:53.546
DETERMINE HOW THESE CHANGES

03:44:53.613 --> 03:44:54.180
WOULD IMPACT THE SMALL BUSINESS

03:44:54.247 --> 03:44:58.151
COMMUNITY. YES I'M I BELIEVE

03:44:58.218 --> 03:45:00.019
THERE WAS A REPORT OR A STUDY

03:45:00.086 --> 03:45:03.857
DONE BY STANFORD- ON ON THIS

03:45:03.923 --> 03:45:05.925
IMPACT DO YOU THINK SINCE

03:45:09.629 --> 03:45:11.397
HAVING THAT STUDY TO REVIEW IN

03:45:11.464 --> 03:45:12.732
ADVANCE AND DISCUSS WITH YOU

03:45:12.799 --> 03:45:16.603
WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL

03:45:16.669 --> 03:45:23.977
AND 4 DEGREES OF INCREASE. I

03:45:24.043 --> 03:45:27.280
THINK IF THE WE THEY WERE THERE

03:45:27.347 --> 03:45:28.581
ARE POOR WE CAN PROVIDE THE

03:45:28.648 --> 03:45:30.617
REPORT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

03:45:30.683 --> 03:45:32.752
ASKING AGAIN I WOULD JUST NOTE

03:45:32.819 --> 03:45:34.721
THAT DURING THE TIME OF THE

03:45:34.787 --> 03:45:35.822

ATTENDANCE- AND- THEY WERE-

03:45:43.463 --> 03:45:45.031
THEY HAD ACCESS TO THE SAME

03:45:45.098 --> 03:45:46.633
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED

03:45:46.699 --> 03:45:47.500

03:45:47.567 --> 03:45:48.801
UNFORTUNATELY THEY OF WHOEVER

THERE'S A MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:48:25.725 --> 03:48:27.293

DOLLARS AS A PILOT PROGRAM AND

03:48:46.879 --> 03:48:48.281
IT WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:48:48.347 --> 03:48:51.918
ALL IT WOULD BE JUST TO-

03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:55.121

PROGRAM WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF

03:49:52.278 --> 03:49:52.845
THESE CHANGES INSTEAD OF HAVING

03:49:52.912 --> 03:49:55.381
THE CHANGES APPLY STATEWIDE TO

03:49:55.448 --> 03:50:01.621
ALL EMPLOYERS. AGAIN I WOULD

03:50:01.687 --> 03:50:03.523
JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE VIEW

03:50:03.589 --> 03:50:04.991
THAT PROTECTING THOUGH THE JOB

03:50:05.057 --> 03:50:06.125
FOR ALL THE WORKERS REGARDLESS

03:50:06.192 --> 03:50:07.860
OF THE SIZE IS CRITICAL FOR

03:50:07.927 --> 03:50:08.961
THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ALL WHO

03:50:09.028 --> 03:50:10.830
ARE ALSO PAYING IN. TO THESE

03:50:10.897 --> 03:50:13.132
ARE FOR THE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE

03:50:13.199 --> 03:50:15.401
ALSO PAIN AND FOR THESE. LEADS

03:50:15.468 --> 03:50:17.703
OR TRY TO MOVE THIS LONG BEFORE

03:50:17.770 --> 03:50:19.705
I GET THE HOOK BUT- YOU KNOW

03:50:19.772 --> 03:50:20.840
IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE

03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:22.675
REPRESENTING BUSINESS. AND

03:50:22.742 --> 03:50:24.710
OTHERS FOR. QUITE SOME TIME

03:50:24.777 --> 03:50:27.013
GIVEN MY AGE. THAT MOST

03:50:27.079 --> 03:50:28.147
BUSINESS VERTICALLY SMALL

03:50:28.214 --> 03:50:30.449
BUSINESS TYPICALLY HAVE A KEY

03:50:30.516 --> 03:50:32.118
EMPLOYEE OR MAYBE TO THAT ARE.

03:50:32.185 --> 03:50:33.819
SIMPLY ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING THE

03:50:33.886 --> 03:50:36.355
BUSINESS RUNNING IN THE TRAINS

03:50:36.422 --> 03:50:36.989
RUNNING ON TIME WOULD YOU AGREE

03:50:37.056 --> 03:50:40.660
WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S ALSO

03:50:40.726 --> 03:50:42.762
AND- THAT IS OFTEN THE CASE

03:50:42.828 --> 03:50:44.463
SENATOR ROSS BUT AT THE

03:50:44.530 --> 03:50:45.765
ADMINISTRATION NOTABLE WAYS

03:50:45.831 --> 03:50:47.867
THAT JOB PROJECTED LEAVES- IS

03:50:47.934 --> 03:50:49.969
ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ALL WORKERS

03:50:50.036 --> 03:50:51.404
SO WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A

03:50:51.470 --> 03:50:54.407
TRADE OFF. WITH THE LET ME ASK

03:50:54.473 --> 03:50:55.908
A QUESTION SO FOR TWENTY.

03:50:55.975 --> 03:50:56.842
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS SINCE THE

03:50:56.909 --> 03:50:58.611
CALIFORNIA FAMILY TWENTY SEVEN

03:50:58.678 --> 03:50:59.512
OR TWENTY EIGHT SINCE TE

03:50:59.579 --> 03:51:00.846
CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT

03:51:00.913 --> 03:51:03.916
WAS FIRST ADOPTED. THE ACTORS

03:51:03.983 --> 03:51:06.219
HAD A PROVISION IN IT THE- SAYS

03:51:06.285 --> 03:51:07.687
THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE IS A

03:51:07.753 --> 03:51:08.921
SALARIED EMPLOYEE ONE OF THE

03:51:08.988 --> 03:51:10.823
HIGHEST PAID IN OTHER WORDS THE

03:51:10.890 --> 03:51:13.526
KEY EMPLOYEE. THAT THERE ARE

03:51:13.593 --> 03:51:16.629
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE

03:51:16.696 --> 03:51:18.931
ACT DESCRIBES IT. BUT THE

03:51:18.998 --> 03:51:20.533
CIRCUMSTANCES AS CIRCUMSTANCES

03:51:20.600 --> 03:51:22.101
WHERE THE EMPLOYER FACES

03:51:22.168 --> 03:51:23.603
SUBSTANTIAL AND GRIEVOUS

03:51:23.669 --> 03:51:25.137
ECONOMIC INJURY TO THE

03:51:25.204 --> 03:51:26.939
OPERATIONS THAT IN THOSE

03:51:27.006 --> 03:51:29.542
CIRCUMSTANCES THE EMPLOYER CAN

03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:31.611
ASK THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS ON

03:51:31.677 --> 03:51:33.713
FAMILY LEAVE TO RETURN TO WORK.

03:51:33.779 --> 03:51:37.617
TO HELP SAVE THE EMPLOYER.

03:51:37.683 --> 03:51:41.454
YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT CORRECT.

03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:46.325
CORRECT OKAY THEN HAVING BEEN

03:51:46.392 --> 03:51:47.994
AWARE OF THAT WHY IN THIS

03:51:48.060 --> 03:51:51.130
PARTICULAR SET OF AMENDMENTS

03:51:51.197 --> 03:51:52.765
DID YOU DID THE ADMINISTRATION

03:51:52.832 --> 03:51:55.768
ELECT TO DELETE THAT PROVISION.

03:51:55.835 --> 03:51:57.937
WHAT WAS THE DECISION MAKING

03:51:58.004 --> 03:52:00.673
CALCULUS THEIR- THE

03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:02.675
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT

03:52:02.742 --> 03:52:04.944
JOB PROTECTED WE'VE REALLY DOES

03:52:05.011 --> 03:52:06.646
NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALL

03:52:06.712 --> 03:52:08.414
WORKERS AND AFTER THE STUDY

03:52:08.481 --> 03:52:10.816
THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

03:52:10.883 --> 03:52:12.051
TRADE OFFS BUT IT REALLY DOES

03:52:12.118 --> 03:52:13.886
NEED TO BE AVAILABLE WHETHER

03:52:13.953 --> 03:52:15.788
YOU'RE A HIGH SALARIED EMPLOYEE

03:52:15.855 --> 03:52:17.056
WHETHER YOU'RE ON LOW SALARIED

03:52:17.123 --> 03:52:18.658
EMPLOYEE. WHETHER YOU WORK AT

03:52:18.724 --> 03:52:20.259
IT TAKES FOR WHETHER YOU WORK

03:52:20.326 --> 03:52:21.694
AT A SMALL FIRM AND THAT'S

03:52:21.761 --> 03:52:23.529
REALLY WHAT IS DRIVING THIS

03:52:23.596 --> 03:52:25.064
BILL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

03:52:25.131 --> 03:52:26.565
THINGS- MIGHT HAVE BEEN

03:52:26.632 --> 03:52:29.402
DIFFERENT FOR. AT TWENTY OR

03:52:29.468 --> 03:52:31.337
TWENTY FIVE YEARS- BUT WHEN

03:52:31.404 --> 03:52:33.205
DEEP MISTRUST LOOKS AT THERE'S-

03:52:33.272 --> 03:52:34.607
A LOT OF THE VALUATION BUT IT'S

03:52:34.674 --> 03:52:37.576
ALSO A VALUES ISSUE THAT I EVEN

03:52:37.643 --> 03:52:38.744
AN EMPLOYEE IN THAT POSITION

03:52:38.811 --> 03:52:39.945
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO JOB

03:52:40.012 --> 03:52:40.746
PROTECTED WILL YOU

03:52:40.813 --> 03:52:42.381
MISUNDERSTAND YOU MISUNDERSTAND

03:52:42.448 --> 03:52:43.816
THE PROVISION THE EMPLOYEE HAS

03:52:43.883 --> 03:52:46.018
A FOR HAS ACCESS TO THE LEAVE

03:52:46.085 --> 03:52:46.852
AND IS ENTITLED TO TAKE THE

03:52:46.919 --> 03:52:49.155
LEAVE. BUT THE EMPLOYER IF THE

03:52:49.221 --> 03:52:50.589
EMPLOYER IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH

03:52:50.656 --> 03:52:52.124
SUBSTANTIAL GRIEVOUS ECONOMIC

03:52:52.191 --> 03:52:54.293
INJURY. THE EMPLOYER HAS THE

03:52:54.360 --> 03:52:55.561
OPPORTUNITY TO CALL THE

03:52:55.628 --> 03:52:57.463
EMPLOYEE BACK THE EMPLOYEE HAS

03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:58.864
A DECISION AT THAT POINT TO

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:00.599
OTHERS STAY ON LEAVE OR COME

03:53:00.666 --> 03:53:01.901
BACK AND THEN AT THE

03:53:01.967 --> 03:53:03.102
APPROPRIATE POINT WHERE THE

03:53:03.169 --> 03:53:05.171
EMPLOYEE RISK REQUEST RETURN TO

03:53:05.237 --> 03:53:07.340
WORK. SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE

03:53:07.406 --> 03:53:09.408
EMPLOYER GETS TO DECIDE IF THE

03:53:09.475 --> 03:53:11.544
EMPLOYERS ACTION IN IN FILLING

03:53:11.610 --> 03:53:12.578
THE POSITION OF THAT'S WHAT

03:53:12.645 --> 03:53:15.915
HAPPENED WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT

03:53:15.981 --> 03:53:16.515
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECT.

03:53:16.582 --> 03:53:17.583
YES ALTHOUGH I DO BELIEVE THAT

03:53:17.650 --> 03:53:19.585
WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS A WEAKER

03:53:19.652 --> 03:53:20.953
FORM OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE

03:53:21.020 --> 03:53:22.288
THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

03:53:22.355 --> 03:53:24.023
PROPOSING DID YOU DO ANY STUDY

03:53:24.090 --> 03:53:25.825
OF THE WORKPLACE IN CALIFORNIA

03:53:25.891 --> 03:53:27.326
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT

03:53:27.393 --> 03:53:27.827
PARTICULAR PROVISION WAS

03:53:27.893 --> 03:53:30.029
CAUSING ANY. PARTICULAR SET OF

PROBLEMS AND IN TERMS OF HOW

03:53:32.031 --> 03:53:33.733
OFTEN IT WAS USED AND- HOW

03:53:33.799 --> 03:53:35.101
OFTEN THE SUBSTANTIAL GRIEVOUS

03:53:35.167 --> 03:53:36.702
ECONOMIC INJURY PROVISION WAS

03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:39.405
TRIGGERED. I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO

03:53:39.472 --> 03:53:41.540
CRASH ON WHETHER AT ANYTHING ON

03:53:41.607 --> 03:53:45.144
THAT SPECIFIC PROVISION. I'M

03:53:45.211 --> 03:53:46.178

SAME PERIOD OF TIME THERE WAS

03:53:52.084 --> 03:53:52.752
ANOTHER PROVISION IN THE

03:53:52.818 --> 03:53:54.920

RESPECT TO BONDING LEAVE THAT

03:54:07.366 --> 03:54:09.602
IF TWO EMPLOYEES WERE PARENTS

YOU DESCRIBED IS THAT I

03:57:30.069 --> 03:57:31.070
UNDERSTAND IN THE

ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THAT

IN THE LOBBY FOR THOSE PEOPLE

04:02:04.142 --> 04:02:04.610
BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE

04:02:04.676 --> 04:02:07.246

04:02:36.842 --> 04:02:38.277
BILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

04:02:38.343 --> 04:02:41.246

THESE BILLS ARE THESE POLICY

04:02:43.048 --> 04:02:44.116
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH

04:02:44.182 --> 04:02:47.953
POLICIES COMMITTEE. AND THEY'RE

04:02:48.020 --> 04:02:49.087
GONNA BE A TIME SUNDAY WHEN

04:02:49.154 --> 04:02:51.823
THESE BUSINESSES AS I SPOKE

04:02:51.890 --> 04:02:54.826
UNDER THE ORIGINAL BUDGET. IT'S

04:02:54.893 --> 04:02:58.397
A RESPECT. YOU CANNOT HAVE A

OR GOVERNMENT WORKER OF ANY

04:03:03.902 --> 04:03:06.004
KIND OR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR

04:03:06.071 --> 04:03:07.506
ANYTHING INTEL A PRIVATE

04:03:07.572 --> 04:03:09.608
BUSINESS PAYS A TAX OR THE

04:03:09.675 --> 04:03:11.443
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THEM. PAY

04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:13.445
A TAX FIRST. AND PUT

04:03:13.512 --> 04:03:14.413
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE OUR

04:03:14.479 --> 04:03:16.481
PRIORITIES WRONG HERE OUR

04:03:16.548 --> 04:03:18.083
PRIORITY SHOULD BE WE NEED A

04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:20.419

GOOD EMPLOYEES AND THERE ARE

04:03:23.121 --> 04:03:24.790
BACK THERE ARE BAD ACTORS.

04:03:24.856 --> 04:03:26.224
ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE TAKE

04:03:26.291 --> 04:03:29.127
ADVANTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE. BUT

04:03:29.194 --> 04:03:31.229
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE NOT

04:03:31.296 --> 04:03:33.298
BAD PEOPLE THEY HAVE A

04:03:33.365 --> 04:03:36.902
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY EMPLOYEES.

IT IS HARD TO FIND GOOD PEOPLE

04:03:40.672 --> 04:03:44.743
TO WORK. THE CARE AND I'M

04:03:44.810 --> 04:03:46.345
COMPETING WITH GOVERNMENT JOBS

04:03:47.713 --> 04:03:49.314
RETIREMENTS THAT I CAN'T BE

04:03:49.381 --> 04:03:52.017

04:03:52.084 --> 04:03:52.617
BUSINESSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF

04:03:52.684 --> 04:03:56.221
THE STATE. SO I TO SAY TO YOU

04:03:56.288 --> 04:03:58.223

PARTICULAR. I GOT MORE CALL

WHAT I WANNA SAY IS I THAT I

04:11:01.079 --> 04:11:02.313
HAVE. DISAGREEMENT WITH THE

04:11:02.380 --> 04:11:04.983

VALUE- AND THE NEED AND THE

04:11:11.122 --> 04:11:14.526
NECESSITY FOR. ALL OF US TO BE

OURSELVES- OR OTHER PEOPLE THE

04:11:21.232 --> 04:11:21.766
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

04:11:21.833 --> 04:11:24.869
PARTICULAR. BILL IS THAT IT HAS

04:11:24.936 --> 04:11:27.305
NO FLEXIBILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER

04:11:27.372 --> 04:11:28.807
THE EMPLOYER CAN'T NEGOTIATE

04:11:28.873 --> 04:11:31.242
THE EMPLOYER- IS HAS THE

04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:36.648
POSSIBILITY OF FACING- A- AT AT

04:11:36.714 --> 04:11:38.082
CAUSE OF ACTION THROUGH A

04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:41.052
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. ON THE

04:11:41.119 --> 04:11:42.620
LEAVE DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE

04:11:42.687 --> 04:11:44.522
FEDERAL LEAVE THAT AS WAS

04:11:44.589 --> 04:11:46.257
ARTICULATED BY MY GOOD FRIEND

04:11:46.324 --> 04:11:48.059
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

04:11:48.126 --> 04:11:50.528
SO- PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS

04:11:50.595 --> 04:11:53.364
THAT BECAUSE- THERE WAS NO

04:11:53.431 --> 04:11:55.467
NEGOTIATION AND- IT WAS

04:11:55.533 --> 04:11:58.336
ATTEMPTED- AND REJECTED IT'S

04:11:58.403 --> 04:11:59.571
THE SAME LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN

04:11:59.637 --> 04:12:00.705
LOOKING AT FOR THE PAST COUPLE

04:12:00.772 --> 04:12:02.974
OF MONTHS. THE PAST MONTH I

04:12:03.041 --> 04:12:05.310
GUESS- IT REALLY AREN'T BECAUSE

04:12:05.376 --> 04:12:06.444
VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT

04:12:06.511 --> 04:12:08.513
BECAUSE THE GIVES ABSOLUTELY NO

04:12:08.580 --> 04:12:10.448
FLEXIBILITY TO SMALL BUSINESSES

04:12:10.515 --> 04:12:13.818
SO- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING AT

04:12:13.885 --> 04:12:15.620
THE AT THIS TIME BUT I WANT TO

04:12:15.687 --> 04:12:18.523
BE VERY CLEAR. THAT I SUPPORT.

04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:22.260
I SUPPORT. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

04:12:22.327 --> 04:12:23.795
PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR

04:12:23.862 --> 04:12:24.562
FAMILIES IT'S JUST YOU'VE GOT

04:12:24.629 --> 04:12:25.630
TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THE

04:12:25.697 --> 04:12:27.232
SMALL BUSINESSES ONE POINT ONE

04:12:27.298 --> 04:12:28.766
MILLION WHO HAVE UNDER FIVE

ALRIGHT ABSOLUTELY. SO I GUESS

04:13:07.338 --> 04:13:09.374
MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT- WHEN

04:13:21.986 --> 04:13:23.721
EACH EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY HAS A

04:13:23.788 --> 04:13:25.390
UNIQUE FUNCTION FACT SOME OF

04:13:25.456 --> 04:13:26.724
THE EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY HAVE

04:13:26.791 --> 04:13:29.394
LICENSES. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE

04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:30.795
ONE EMPLOYEE DO ANOTHER

04:13:30.862 --> 04:13:32.964
EMPLOYEES JOB. THE LAW WOULDN'T

04:13:33.031 --> 04:13:35.300
PERMIT IT. ANYWAY SO WHEN YOU

04:13:35.366 --> 04:13:37.268
LOSE AN EMPLOYEE WE CAN'T JUST

04:13:37.335 --> 04:13:38.736
SIMPLY SHIFT SOMEONE AROUND-

04:13:38.803 --> 04:13:40.438

04:13:40.505 --> 04:13:42.407
FOR FINANCE FIRST OF ALL IT IS

04:13:42.473 --> 04:13:47.312
THAT. KNOWING THAT. WE HAVE

04:13:47.378 --> 04:13:49.380

ARE UNRESOLVED OR UNEXAMINED.

04:13:52.016 --> 04:13:54.052
IS AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW WE

04:13:54.118 --> 04:13:55.587

TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE

04:14:04.796 --> 04:14:08.299
ISSUES. THAT WOULD STRONGLY

04:14:08.366 --> 04:14:10.201
AFFECTS SMALL BUSINESSES. IN A

04:14:10.268 --> 04:14:13.037
WAY THAT COULD STILL TRY TO

04:14:13.104 --> 04:14:14.572
FIND A WAY TO AFFORD. EMPLOYEES

04:14:14.639 --> 04:14:17.208
LEAVE WITHOUT ESSENTIALLY-

04:14:17.275 --> 04:14:17.909

BUSINESS TO RETURN TO I DON'T

04:17:45.683 --> 04:17:46.751
BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESS OWNER

04:17:46.818 --> 04:17:48.219
HAS AN OBLIGATION TO KEEP THE

04:17:48.286 --> 04:17:49.587
BUSINESS OKAY AND- WHEN THEY

04:17:49.654 --> 04:17:51.656
WERE OTHERWISE GOING TO- DOCTOR

04:17:51.722 --> 04:17:53.224
OTHER REASONS JUST A HIGHER

04:17:53.291 --> 04:17:54.525
THAT EMPLOYEE BUT- IF YOU'RE

04:17:54.592 --> 04:17:56.027
ASKING ABOUT SPECIFIC WHETHER

04:17:56.093 --> 04:17:58.362
IT'S SEVERANCE. WHETHER OKAY

04:17:58.429 --> 04:17:59.664
CONGRESSIONAL IT'S ALL THESE

04:17:59.730 --> 04:18:01.465
COULD BE TIED- UNDER THE

04:18:01.532 --> 04:18:02.733
BANKRUPTCY CODE UNDER PRE

04:18:02.800 --> 04:18:04.502
EXISTING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS

04:18:04.569 --> 04:18:05.770
THAT ARE GOVERNED BY STATE LAW

04:18:05.837 --> 04:18:06.871
FOR THE EMPLOYERS I DON'T WANT

04:18:06.938 --> 04:18:08.406
TO SPEAK TO THAT. OKAY I

04:18:08.472 --> 04:18:09.740
PROPHETICAL SCENARIO AND SO I

04:18:09.807 --> 04:18:11.709
HVE ALL THE FACTS. OKAY SO I

04:18:11.776 --> 04:18:12.643
MEAN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:14.912
THAT WE ALSO NEED PEOPLE NEED

04:18:14.979 --> 04:18:17.148
TO UNDERSTAND- IN TERMS OF

04:18:17.215 --> 04:18:21.519
THEIR PLANNING BUT- YOU KNOW. I

04:18:21.586 --> 04:18:24.222
GUESS THE- SO FRANKLY I WOULD

04:18:24.288 --> 04:18:26.290
SAY IS THAT FIRST OF ALL. I

04:18:26.357 --> 04:18:28.759
AGREE WITH YOU THAT- IDEALLY WE

04:18:28.826 --> 04:18:30.328
SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY JOB

04:18:30.394 --> 04:18:31.863
PROTECTED LEAVE WE SHOULD

04:18:31.929 --> 04:18:34.098
ACTUALLY HAVE PAID LEAVE. FOR

04:18:34.165 --> 04:18:36.667
EVERYONE. BUT I ALSO WOULD SAY

04:18:36.734 --> 04:18:38.302
IS THAT- BECAUSE WE TALKED

04:18:38.369 --> 04:18:40.171
ABOUT OUR VALUES AND- OUR

04:18:40.238 --> 04:18:41.606
BUDGET IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR

04:18:41.672 --> 04:18:43.674
VALUES. IS THAT WE SHOULD BE

04:18:43.741 --> 04:18:45.843
BUDGETING FOR ENOUGH MONEY NOT

04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:47.612
JUST A MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP

04:18:47.678 --> 04:18:49.881
SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN THEY HAVE

04:18:49.947 --> 04:18:50.882
AN EMPLOYEE WHO NEEDS TO

04:18:50.948 --> 04:18:53.384
BEYOND. TWELVE WEEKS SEVEN

04:18:53.451 --> 04:18:57.154
MONTHS OF LEAVE. SO THAT THAT

04:18:57.221 --> 04:18:58.656
SMALL BUSINESS IS STILL AROUND.

04:18:58.723 --> 04:18:59.690
AT THE END OF THAT LEAVE

04:18:59.757 --> 04:19:01.158
BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESSES IN

04:19:01.225 --> 04:19:02.860
AROUND NOT ONLY HAS THE-

04:19:02.927 --> 04:19:04.328
EMPLOYEE WHO WENT ON LEAVE LOST

04:19:04.395 --> 04:19:05.963
THEIR JOB EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S

04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:07.331
BEEN IN THAT BUSINESS IS ALSO

04:19:07.398 --> 04:19:10.701
LOST THEIR JOB AS WELL. SO YOU

04:19:10.768 --> 04:19:12.970
KNOW I. YOU KNOW LARGER

04:19:13.037 --> 04:19:15.106
BUSINESSES CAN PERHAPS YOU KNOW

04:19:15.172 --> 04:19:16.274
SIX FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXCHANGE

04:19:16.340 --> 04:19:17.375
PEOPLE HAVE SOMEONE COVER FOR

04:19:17.441 --> 04:19:19.610
SOMEONE- THEY CAN SPREAD THE

04:19:19.677 --> 04:19:21.245
COSTS AROUND A LITTLE MORE. IN

04:19:21.312 --> 04:19:22.880
YES PROPORTIONALLY THE HAVE YOU

04:19:22.947 --> 04:19:23.781
KNOW CERTAIN NUMBER PEOPLE ON

04:19:23.848 --> 04:19:25.416
LEAVE BUT THEY CAN BALANCE IT

04:19:25.483 --> 04:19:27.318
OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:19:27.385 --> 04:19:27.885
VERY SMALL BUSINESS LISTING

04:19:27.952 --> 04:19:30.421
UNDER FIVE. WHEN YOU LOSE A KEY

04:19:30.488 --> 04:19:31.555
EMPLOYEE AND I THINK THAT'S

04:19:31.622 --> 04:19:32.924
PART OF PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW

04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:34.425
THE ENTIRE LEGAL HISTORY OF

04:19:34.492 --> 04:19:36.661
THAT PROVISION IN THE LAW. THE

04:19:36.727 --> 04:19:37.662
PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE A KEY

04:19:37.728 --> 04:19:39.463
EMPLOYEE AND OF THAT PERSON'S

04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:42.066
GONE. YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE

04:19:42.133 --> 04:19:44.335
ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN

04:19:44.402 --> 04:19:46.904
TEMPT FOR THAT IT DEPENDS- THAT

04:19:46.971 --> 04:19:48.272
PERSON WHO YOU'RE HIRING IS

04:19:48.339 --> 04:19:49.840
ATTEMPTED IS NOT GOING TO BE

04:19:49.907 --> 04:19:51.175
COMMITTED TO YOUR BUSINESS

04:19:51.242 --> 04:19:53.544
BECAUSE- ONLY ATTEMPT. IN FACT

04:19:53.611 --> 04:19:54.612
THE WILL IF SO THEY CAN FIND A

04:19:54.679 --> 04:19:56.847
PERMANENT JOB THEY'RE GOING OFF

04:19:56.914 --> 04:20:00.051
TO WORK THAT PERMANENT JOB. AND

04:20:00.117 --> 04:20:01.185
THEN YOU'RE NOW TRYING TO FIND

04:20:01.252 --> 04:20:02.219
ANOTHER PERSON TO COVER

04:20:02.286 --> 04:20:03.721
WHATEVER REMAINING PORTION IS

04:20:03.788 --> 04:20:04.588
LAUGHED BUT IT WITH THE

04:20:04.655 --> 04:20:06.023
CRITICAL PART OF THE JOB THEN

04:20:06.090 --> 04:20:07.425
ESSENTIALLY YOUR BUSINESS MAY

04:20:07.491 --> 04:20:09.694
GO BELLY UP BECAUSE THERE'S-

04:20:09.760 --> 04:20:11.362
WITHOUT FORGET. IT'S NOT JUST

04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:12.596
YOUR COSTS THAT YOU HAVE TO

04:20:12.663 --> 04:20:13.764
DEAL WITH IT'S THE MATTER

04:20:13.831 --> 04:20:15.333
REVENUE YOU BRING AND SO IF

04:20:15.399 --> 04:20:16.367
YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T ABLE TO

04:20:16.434 --> 04:20:17.668
FUNCTION YOU NOT BRING IN ANY

04:20:17.735 --> 04:20:19.637
MONEY. TO PAY FOR ANY COSTS NOT

04:20:19.704 --> 04:20:20.905
JUST THE COST OF THE PERSONS ON

04:20:20.972 --> 04:20:22.506
LEAVE THE COST OF PAYING ANYONE

04:20:22.573 --> 04:20:24.442
ELSE THE RENT UTILITIES AND

04:20:24.508 --> 04:20:25.843
EVERYTHING ELSE. I THINK THAT'S

04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:26.744
WHAT YOU'RE PERHAPS HEARING

04:20:26.811 --> 04:20:27.845
FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:20:27.912 --> 04:20:29.146
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CLEAN

04:20:29.213 --> 04:20:31.649
HELLO IT'S MONEY IN MY YEAH SO

04:20:31.716 --> 04:20:32.950
YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE BOOKS

04:20:33.017 --> 04:20:36.320
BALANCE. SO SINCE YOU SAID YES

04:20:36.387 --> 04:20:38.656
TO THE QUESTION ABOUT- PENDING

04:20:38.723 --> 04:20:42.727
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS- I

04:20:42.793 --> 04:20:45.863
UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT- YOU

04:20:45.930 --> 04:20:47.598
KNOW. THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY

04:20:47.665 --> 04:20:49.433
PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR- I

04:20:49.500 --> 04:20:51.168
ACTUALLY. AGREE WITH THE

04:20:51.235 --> 04:20:52.503
GOVERNOR THAT WE SHOULD FIND A

04:20:52.570 --> 04:20:54.238
WAY TO GIVE EVERYONE LEAVE BUT

04:20:54.305 --> 04:20:55.339
WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE

04:20:55.406 --> 04:20:57.875
OUT HOW TO DO IT IN A WAY SO

04:20:57.942 --> 04:20:59.043
THAT THIS IS A REAL PROMISE.

04:20:59.110 --> 04:21:00.244
BECAUSE I HAVE WOULD HATE FOR

04:21:00.311 --> 04:21:01.712
BUSINESSES TO BE CLOSING FROM

04:21:01.779 --> 04:21:05.082
UNDERNEATH PEOPLE. WHO WHO ARE

04:21:05.149 --> 04:21:06.650
IN THE MIDDLE TO LEAVE THAT'S

04:21:06.717 --> 04:21:07.218
THE WORST THING THAT WAY TO

04:21:07.284 --> 04:21:10.021
LOSE YOUR JOB- AND- AND ALSO

04:21:10.087 --> 04:21:11.088
HAVE OTHER PEOPLE LOSE THEIR

04:21:11.155 --> 04:21:14.692
JOBS OF THOSE AS WELL. AND SO-

04:21:14.759 --> 04:21:16.093
I WILL BE WILLING TO VOTE TO

04:21:16.160 --> 04:21:18.829
GET THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE-

04:21:18.896 --> 04:21:19.897
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT

04:21:19.964 --> 04:21:22.166
FURTHER DISCUSSION- BUT I DO

04:21:22.233 --> 04:21:24.168
HOPE. THAT WELL I CERTAINLY

04:21:24.235 --> 04:21:25.669
UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR'S HAD

04:21:25.736 --> 04:21:26.604
CONVERSATION WITH OUR

04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:28.606
LEADERSHIP AND- LEADERSHIP AND

04:21:28.672 --> 04:21:29.707
ASSEMBLY. THAT WE CAN HAVE A

04:21:29.774 --> 04:21:30.975
FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT

04:21:31.042 --> 04:21:33.210
REALLY WERE VALUES ARE AND WHAT

04:21:33.277 --> 04:21:35.346
WE SHOULD COMMIT IN TERMS OF

04:21:35.413 --> 04:21:36.647
OUR RESOURCES TO BEING SURE

04:21:36.714 --> 04:21:38.883
THAT. WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE THE

04:21:38.949 --> 04:21:39.884
GET THE LEAVE THE PEOPLE IN A

04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:43.020
WAY. THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND

04:21:43.087 --> 04:21:44.622
THAT WE DON'T SIMPLY SAY WELL

04:21:44.688 --> 04:21:45.623
WE'LL PUT A RULE AND WE'LL PUT

04:21:45.689 --> 04:21:46.791
IT ON THE BACKS OF ALL THE

04:21:46.857 --> 04:21:48.659
SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DON'T

04:21:48.726 --> 04:21:50.895
ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO

04:21:50.961 --> 04:21:53.097
MAKE IT ALL WORK OUT. BECAUSE I

04:21:53.164 --> 04:21:54.031
THINK THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND

04:21:54.098 --> 04:21:55.666
OF COST AND THAT WOULD POINT

04:21:55.733 --> 04:21:57.568
OUT YES IT'S- COVE IT IS A TIME

04:21:57.635 --> 04:21:59.270
WHEN WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

04:21:59.336 --> 04:22:01.172
TO TAKE LEAVE. IT'S ALSO A TIME

04:22:01.238 --> 04:22:02.440
WHEN BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING

04:22:02.506 --> 04:22:03.707
AND THEY DON'T THAT'S WHY WE

04:22:03.774 --> 04:22:04.408
HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:22:04.475 --> 04:22:07.211
DOING. YOU KNOW PPP LOANS AND-

04:22:07.278 --> 04:22:08.379
DISASTER LOANS AND STUFF LIKE

04:22:08.446 --> 04:22:09.580
THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO

04:22:09.647 --> 04:22:11.882
REVENUE SHORT AND- SO. LET'S

04:22:11.949 --> 04:22:13.017
TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION

04:22:13.084 --> 04:22:14.318
THAT WE CAN GET TO A POLICY

04:22:14.385 --> 04:22:17.388
GOAL TOGETHER. IN A WAY THAT.

04:22:17.455 --> 04:22:19.824
CAN GET US TO YOU KNOW WHAT.

04:22:19.890 --> 04:22:21.692
IT'S IT GETS REFLECTIVE OUR

04:22:21.759 --> 04:22:23.461
VALUES SO- WITH THAT. LOOK

04:22:23.527 --> 04:22:25.096
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.

04:22:25.162 --> 04:22:26.997
AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH%

04:22:27.064 --> 04:22:28.666
MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL IN TRYING

04:22:28.732 --> 04:22:30.935
TO ACHIEVE. I THINK I SHARED

04:22:31.001 --> 04:22:32.636
GOALS OF TRYING TO BE SURE

04:22:32.703 --> 04:22:34.905
PEOPLE CAN GET BELIEVES THAT-

04:22:34.972 --> 04:22:36.207
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THAT

04:22:36.273 --> 04:22:37.908
WE CREATED A DIFFERENT WAY OF

04:22:37.975 --> 04:22:39.376
LOOKING AT OUR WORKPLACE IN A

04:22:39.443 --> 04:22:41.245
WAY THAT'S TRULY SUSTAINABLE.

04:22:41.312 --> 04:22:43.747
AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE

04:22:43.814 --> 04:22:46.650
TO AFTER JOBS THANK YOU. SENATE

04:22:46.717 --> 04:22:54.625
BILL. I DO A LITTLE RESEARCH ON

04:22:54.692 --> 04:23:02.733
THIS ON MY OWN. AIR AND. THIS

04:23:02.800 --> 04:23:03.267
IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE

04:23:03.334 --> 04:23:07.404
COUNTRY. WERE SO FAR BEHIND

04:23:07.471 --> 04:23:09.406
OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS ISSUE.

04:23:09.473 --> 04:23:11.442
IT'S ALMOST IS PRETTY MUCH OF

04:23:11.509 --> 04:23:15.546
BURSTING. I THINK THAT THE

04:23:15.613 --> 04:23:18.449
ECONOMIC. CONDITIONS THAT

04:23:18.516 --> 04:23:21.318
EXISTS IN AND- FAMILIES THAT

04:23:21.385 --> 04:23:24.455
HAVE PAID LEAVE. IS MUCH

04:23:24.522 --> 04:23:26.824
SUPERIOR TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY

04:23:26.891 --> 04:23:30.494
WERE. SIMPLY A CHOICE HAS TO BE

04:23:30.561 --> 04:23:34.365
MADE BETWEEN YOUR- LOVE ONE AND

04:23:34.431 --> 04:23:35.966
KEEPING YOUR JOB AND I THINK

04:23:36.033 --> 04:23:38.335
THAT'S A PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND

04:23:38.402 --> 04:23:39.503
THE ISSUES WITH THE SMALL

04:23:39.570 --> 04:23:44.275
BUSINESS. BUT I HAVE A QUESTION

OTHER COUNTRIES. THE RESEARCH

I'VE SEEN SHOWS THAT WERE WAY

04:23:54.518 --> 04:23:56.620
FAR BEHIND IS THAT IS THAT TRUE

04:23:56.687 --> 04:23:58.622
IS THAT A TRUE STATEMENT.

04:23:58.689 --> 04:24:01.091
COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. IN

04:24:01.158 --> 04:24:02.560
TERMS OF THE RESEARCH THAT HAS

04:24:02.626 --> 04:24:04.728
BEEN DONE ON THIS. THAT'S A

04:24:04.795 --> 04:24:09.033
QUESTION FOR. OR BUDGET THE

04:24:09.099 --> 04:24:11.835
FINANCE DEPARTMENT PEOPLE YES

04:24:11.902 --> 04:24:14.572

04:24:17.775 --> 04:24:19.276
OF THE COUNTRIES AND NORTHERN

04:24:19.343 --> 04:24:20.177
EUROPE THAT THE UNITED STATES

04:24:20.244 --> 04:24:22.146
IS SOMETIMES COMPARED TO WHEN

04:24:22.213 --> 04:24:24.381
IT COMES TO THE SOCIAL BENEFITS

04:24:24.448 --> 04:24:26.450
PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT IT

04:24:26.517 --> 04:24:28.219
IS THE K. A. SAT IN CALIFORNIA

04:24:28.285 --> 04:24:30.120
AND THE UNITED STATES WE DO NOT

04:24:30.187 --> 04:24:31.956
PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF

04:24:32.022 --> 04:24:33.357
BENEFITS IN AREAS LIKE THESE.

04:24:33.424 --> 04:24:36.093
THERE IS THERE A LIST OF THOSE

04:24:36.160 --> 04:24:38.629
YOU CAN COMPARE OUR OF. US TWO

04:24:38.696 --> 04:24:41.232
OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES. I DON'T

04:24:41.298 --> 04:24:43.734

04:24:45.669 --> 04:24:47.471
BILL ALSO WHO ARE ROBUST WE'VE

04:24:47.538 --> 04:24:49.006
PROTECTIONS IN THERE AND THEN

04:24:49.073 --> 04:24:50.074
IN TERMS OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES

04:24:50.140 --> 04:24:51.575
SINCE THEY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE

04:24:51.642 --> 04:24:54.511
ON THIS AND WE DO. HOW DO HOW

04:24:54.578 --> 04:24:56.380
DO THEY HOW DO THEY- DEAL WITH

04:24:56.447 --> 04:24:57.681
SOME OF THESE COMPLEXITIES WITH

04:24:57.748 --> 04:25:01.151
THE- SMALL BUSINESS THEY HAVE

04:25:01.218 --> 04:25:01.752
THEY HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THEY

04:25:01.819 --> 04:25:04.288
CAN DO. WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS

04:25:04.355 --> 04:25:07.091
HOW DO THEY- THERE WAS SOME OF

04:25:07.157 --> 04:25:09.393
THOSE ISSUES- OR HOW ABOUT WHAT

04:25:09.460 --> 04:25:10.828
HAPPENS IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN

04:25:10.894 --> 04:25:14.365
SOME OF THESE. ANECDOTAL CASES

04:25:14.431 --> 04:25:16.200
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TODAY

04:25:16.267 --> 04:25:18.736
ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE. WELL

04:25:18.802 --> 04:25:20.771
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT

04:25:20.838 --> 04:25:21.805
DATE WITH THEY WILL CERTAINLY

04:25:21.872 --> 04:25:24.508
VARY BY COUNTRY I THINK THAT-

04:25:24.575 --> 04:25:26.010
THE ONE THING I CAN SAY IS THAT

04:25:26.076 --> 04:25:27.611
IN A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES

04:25:27.678 --> 04:25:29.713
WHERE- THESE PROTECTIONS ARE IN

04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:31.482
PLACE I DIDN'T IN PLACE FOR

04:25:31.548 --> 04:25:34.485
MANY YEARS. SO SOCIETIES HAVE

04:25:34.551 --> 04:25:37.254
ADJUSTED- TO RECOGNIZING THE

04:25:37.321 --> 04:25:38.555
VALUE THESE PROTECTIONS WHILE

04:25:38.622 --> 04:25:40.124
ALSO KNOWING THAT THEY COME

04:25:40.190 --> 04:25:41.892
WITH SOME TRADE OFFS BUT THAT

04:25:41.959 --> 04:25:43.727
THE SOCIETY HAS ADJUSTED AS THE

04:25:43.794 --> 04:25:45.429
LAW HAS GONE INTO EFFECT AND-

04:25:45.496 --> 04:25:48.832
WE HAVE BEARING STATES AND THEY

04:25:48.899 --> 04:25:49.466
HAVE VERY LAWS ON THIS CORRECT.

04:25:49.533 --> 04:25:52.970
THAT IS CORRECT IS THE AREA OF

04:25:53.037 --> 04:25:54.905
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT- WE

04:25:54.972 --> 04:25:56.473
SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF

04:25:56.540 --> 04:25:59.977
NATIONAL. GENERAL LAW ON THIS

04:26:00.044 --> 04:26:03.414
SUBJECT. SHOULD THE GOVERNOR

04:26:03.480 --> 04:26:05.282
HAD AYE AYE AS FAR AS I KNOW

04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:07.284
HAS NOT WAITING ON ASK FEDERAL-

04:26:07.351 --> 04:26:09.420
LAW IN PARTICULAR- THE

04:26:09.486 --> 04:26:10.554
ADMINISTRATION IS A STRONG

04:26:10.621 --> 04:26:12.923
SUPPORTER OF- JOB PROTECTED

04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:14.591
LEAVE AS WELL AS EXPANDED PAID

04:26:14.658 --> 04:26:16.660
FAMILY WEEDS SO WE'VE MADE THAT

04:26:16.727 --> 04:26:17.995
CLEAR IN THE STATE- I SHOULDN'T

04:26:18.062 --> 04:26:20.130
GO BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

04:26:20.197 --> 04:26:21.732
SAID FOR THE STATE BUT HE IS A

04:26:21.799 --> 04:26:22.800
STRONG SUPPORTER OF THOSE

04:26:22.866 --> 04:26:24.234
OPPOSITION YEAH I THINK PERHAPS

04:26:24.301 --> 04:26:27.438
