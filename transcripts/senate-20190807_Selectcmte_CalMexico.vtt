00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.621
THAT'S GOOD IS BECAUSE YOU

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:14.392

NOT USING THEM BUT TO SERVE

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.357
THOSE TERRORISTS TYPICALLY

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.426
RIGHT THEY GO HOME BUT

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:50.561

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.682
INTERIOR OF MEXICO. SO WHAT HAS

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.584
HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE A FOUR

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.653
YEARS AGO WE HAD THREE POINT

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:31.521
NINE PEOPLE AT THE D. ONE

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:33.557
AIRPORT THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:34.191
TO HAVE MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.692
PEOPLE IN TIJUANA AIRPORT. BUT

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.961
NOT ONLY IN TIJUANA MEXICO ONLY

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.529
FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD OR

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.465
MILLION PASSENGERS BY OCTOBER

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.533
OF LAST YEAR WHICH IS 46%

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.537
INCREASE. IN PASSENGERS FOR

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.639
MEXICO SO THIS HAS BEEN THIS IS

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.575
A VERY GREAT WE'VE I'VE ALSO

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.610
HAD MILLION PASSENGERS ON THE

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.612
CRUISE LINES. SO THAT FOREIGN

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:59.616
SONATA WHICH IS NUMBER. ONE IN

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:00.083
THE PACIFIC IT'S ALSO

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:05.722
EXTRAORDINARY. BUT WHAT IS

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.824
HAPPENING WITH THIS HOW DID

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.693
THIS CAME ABOUT FIRST OF ALL WE

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:11.561
HAVE OF KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE TO

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.195
WORK ON A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:13.563
OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE DID

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.866
NOT HAVE TO SELL DESTINATIONS.

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:16.466
WE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE. IT'S

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.834
NOT ONLY ABOUT THE FIVE STAR

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:18.401
HOTEL IT'S ABOUT YOUR FIVE

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:21.805
SENSES. SO WHICH CHANGED THE

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:22.372
WHOLE STRATEGY OF HOW WE DID

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:25.509
THINGS. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.511
WE HAVE A STRATEGIC MARKETS

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:28.178
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY GOOD

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.913
FOR US. BUT I'LL THOSE MARKETS

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.882
THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.517
DO SOMETHING WITH CALIFORNIA.

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.017
WHICH THE TRUTH OF IT WE

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.585
HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH. FOR

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:41.591
EXAMPLE. IT WAS MENTIONED HERE

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:45.695
THAT WE CAN DO THE TWO NATION

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:47.697
VACATION BUT WE CAN ALSO DO TO

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:51.668
NATION CONVENTION. WE CAN DO

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:52.235
HALF OF THE CONVENTION IN

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.937
MEXICO HALF OF THE CONVENTION

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:57.507
THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER WE HAVE

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.576
SEND OUT A THOUSAND METER OR WE

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:01.511
CAN HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:02.078
AND THIS CONVENTION CENTER

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:03.713
WHICH IS ON GROUND LEVEL THAT

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.782
MEANS WE CAN DO. EXPOSITION ON

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.884
MACHINERY AND HAVE A CONVENTION

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:09.586
ON MACHINERY ON THIS SIDE OF

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.955
THE BORDER. WHICH HAS NOT BEEN

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:15.625
DONE BEFORE. BUT ALSO. WE CAN

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:16.226
DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY AS

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.061
FAR AS TOURISM AS FAR AS THE

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.629
FILM INDUSTRY TOURISM. LAST

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:23.967
YEAR WE HAD. SEVENTY SEVEN. BIG

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.802
FILMS. FILMED IN BAJA

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:27.704
CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO A LOT IF

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:30.040
WE GO HAND IN HAND WITH FILM

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.975
TOURISM. OR WITH CALIFORNIA

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.743
WHICH SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.645
WE HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:41.785
ALSO WE HAVE FLIGHTS FROM CHINA

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:42.352
WHICH I THINK IT COULD BE

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:45.689
EXTRAORDINARY FOR SELLING

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:46.323
CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.991
THIS AND DO A TWO NATION

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.659
VACATION WITH THE CHINESE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.861
MARKET WHICH IS A HUGE MARKET

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:54.097
AS YOU ALL KNOW BUT ALSO YOU

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:57.701
HAVE TO FLIGHTS FOR EUROPE

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:58.335
WHICH THIS IN ABOUT NINETY FOUR

00:53:58.401 --> 00:53:59.869
NO FROM EUROPE IT'S

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:01.938
COMPLICATED. WE CAN DO IT TO

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.840
NATION VACATION WITH WITH

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.875
EUROPE AND THIS DOES NOT MEAN

00:54:05.942 --> 00:54:07.644
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:10.013
SIX DAYS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.615
IN CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:12.215
SPEND FOUR AND SPENT TWO IN

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:15.652
BASRA THIS MEANS IS THIS THESE

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:16.319
GUYS WILL SPEND TEN DAYS IN THE

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:18.088
REGION WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:23.893
FOR BOTH OF US. AND THAT'S A

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.494
GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ALSO

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:29.766
HAVE. ALSO IN ADVENTURE BAJA

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.400

TOURISM IN ADVENTURE LIKE

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:34.037
CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN GO HAND

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:36.072
IN HAND WHAT HAS THAT CAN'T BE

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:36.706
DONE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:38.241
CAN BE DONE ON THAT SIDE OF THE

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:38.842
BORDER FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES.

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:40.110
WHEN WE JOIN TOGETHER ON BOTH

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:40.577
SIDES CAN BE SOMETHING

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:43.980
EXTRAORDINARY. ALSO WITH THEM

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:45.782
IN DOING EXTRAORDINARY GOOD.

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:49.686

COMMENTS FIRST. WE I MENTIONED

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:35.699
THE CAMPAIGN OURSELVES WERE

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:36.332
WE'RE NOT SELLING DESTINATIONS

THEY DID FOR THE FOOD FOR THE

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.729
WIND OR FOR THE CRAFT BEER.

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.864
ALSO THAT CAMPAIGN GOT AS

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.733
NUMBER TWO IN CONTEXT SO WE'VE

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.735
BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB AND I

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.937
HOPE WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:19.809
COMBINED WITH CALIFORNIA. THIS

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:20.443
IS WAS SOMETHING I WASN'T GOING

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.880
TO MENTION SENATOR. BUT YOU

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:24.447
MENTIONED WHAT HAPPENED WITH

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:27.851
THAT C. B. X. LAST YEAR IN

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:31.721
WASHINGTON WE HAD A MEETING

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:32.355
WITH C. B. P. AND WE TOLD THEM

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:35.959
THAT. IS HOW THE TRAIN CROSSES

00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:38.094
THE BORDER RIGHT NOW TO DELIVER

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:38.661
MERCHANDISE AND IT GOES BACK

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.965
AND FORTH. WE COULD DO

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.800
SOMETHING WITH A CHARLIE. WE

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.835
HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE USING

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.837
THAT TROLLEY WHICH COULD BE A

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:48.438
PRE CLEARANCE TROLLEY LIKE WE

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:52.041
DO IN CENTURY. YOU WOULD HAVE

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:55.745
20% LESS EMISSIONS YOU HAVE 20%

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:58.047
LESS TRAFFIC AND IT WOULD BE A

00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:59.883
QUICK MOMENT OF YOU OF HAVING

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.818
20% MORE PERSONNEL. THE

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.787
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALMOST THERE.

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:08.024
THERE WOULD BE NO. NOT LOTS OF

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:10.093
MONEY THAT WOULD BE NEEDED AND

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.930
FOR SECURITY PURPOSES ACCORDING

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.765
TO C. B. P. IN WASHINGTON SAID

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.834
IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:20.170
CHECK PEOPLE ON ONE TROLLEY

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:22.172
THAN TO CHECK NINE THOUSAND

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:24.140
VEHICLES SO THAT'S SOMETHING I

TEN YEAR OF GOVERNOR GRAY

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.312
DAVIS. BUT THIS INITIATIVE BY

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:45.047
GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS TO PROMOTE

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.002
OPINION WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.071

PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORLD.

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:32.995
HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF THE

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.376
THE YOU IN THE C. ISSUE THE

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.144
COMPANY'S THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.280
LACKS A SIMILAR INITIATIVE. AND

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.415
AFTER THE THREE YEAR BAN ON

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.384
TRAVEL TO MEXICO BY FORMER

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:59.021
CHANCELLOR SEES YOU CHANCELLOR

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:01.023
CHARLIE REED THE SYSTEM HAS

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.158
BARELY RETURN TO ABOUT THIRTY

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:06.995
PERCENT. OF THE FORMER IN ROME

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:07.596
IN IN THIS YEAR'S YOU MEXICO

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:11.133
STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM. I HAVE

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:13.101
SHARED THIS PRESENTATION WITH

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:13.669
THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.404
COMMITTEE THE SENATORS THAT ARE

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.439
WITH US AND YOU MAY SEE THAT

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:27.115
CHART. IT IS VERY VERY LOW. AND

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.418
THE IDEA OF COMMON KEEN ON THIS

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.219
IS TO PROMOTE WHY WE NEED TO

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:31.820
EXPAND WHY WE NEED TO IMPROVE.

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.288
IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE CSU

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.324
SYSTEM. BUT ALSO ACROSS

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:41.029
CALIFORNIA'S. HIGHER EDUCATION

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.031
ALL THREE SYSTEMS THE COMMUNITY

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.200
COLLEGE A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.235
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:47.803
THE STATE THEY HAVE STUDY

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:51.373
ABROAD. AND IN THIS CASE THIS

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.175
YOU YOUR SYSTEM HAS BARELY

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:55.410
RETURN TO ABOUT 30% OF THE

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:59.381
FORMER IN ROME AND BACK IN THE

01:16:59.448 --> 01:16:59.915
NINETEEN NINETIES WHERE I

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:01.416
WORKED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.585
OFFICE. WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:09.424
UP ABOUT. SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:13.295
STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE. OUR

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:13.862
TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WE'RE

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.130
TALKING ABOUT APPROXIMATELY

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.299
THREE STUDENTS FOR CAMPUS WELL

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:19.434
LET ME TELL YOU AND THIS IS

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:21.336
SOME RESEARCH THAT I DID THIS

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:23.305
IS UPDATED INFORMATION JUST GOT

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:27.209
WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.411
HAVE NOW IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:37.452
IN ROLE ONLY. EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.053
THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIS

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.390
YEAR ELEVEN. IN THE C. ISSUE

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.425
MEXICO STARTED A PROGRAM WHICH

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:49.264
IS HOUSED AT THE IN THE THEY

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:49.865
TAKE THE MONTERREY CAMPUS AND

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.433
GET IT THOUGH. USED TO BE IN

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.602
MEXICO CITY AT THE BETTER MANY

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:57.239
KINDA. BUT IT IS VERY

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:57.839
CONSISTENT AT THIS CONCERNING

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.574
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MUCH

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:03.278
GREATER AMOUNT OF STUDENTS FROM

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:07.149
CALIFORNIA'S KELSEY SYSTEM IN

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.518
LET ME GO ON TO REFLECT. WHY

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:11.586
THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN THIS

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.555
YEAR'S YOU HAS GROWN TO MORE

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.590
THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:17.526
STUDENTS TO BECOME THE LARGE

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.461
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:23.331
STATES WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:23.932
FIFTY THOUSAND MEXICAN CHICANO

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:27.369
LATINO. ENROLLMENT ONE THIRD

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.538
AND GROWING CLOSE TO BECOME THE

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:33.208
MAJORITY WITHIN THIS DECADE IN

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:35.410
THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM AND TOPPING

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.312
MORE THAN 30% CURRENTLY. GIVEN

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.214
THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.450
BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AS THE FIFTH

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:43.285
LARGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD AND

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:45.554
MEXICO AS THE THIRTEEN LARGE

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.422
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THIS ALSO

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.491
REPRESENTS THE LET THE NURSERY

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.393
SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RESOURCE.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.528
THAT COULD BE CRITICALLY

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.197
IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.199
FUTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:57.799
REGION AND THAT ALL CONNECTS

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:01.403
WITH HAS BEEN PRESENTED THIS IS

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.207
DUE TO UNDERSCORE WHY WE NEED

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:05.774
TO DO MORE. AND ONE DONE A

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.409
REALLY THERE HAS BEEN A

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.377
SIGNIFICANT DECREASE SCENE IN

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.213
THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.415
EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE DUE TO THE

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:15.517
C. ISSUES BAN BUT ALSO DUE TO

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.552
THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY AT

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.454
THAT POINT WHEN THE BAN WENT

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:23.425
INTO EFFECT. AND THE FEAR THAT

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:27.329
WE HAVE ABOUT SECURITY ABOUT

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.598
CRIME AT THE NORCAL WAR THAT WE

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.433
HAVE IN MEXICO BUT I WOULD

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.368
POINT TO ONE ADDITIONAL PROBLEM

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.537
THAT WE HAVE IN THIS USE YOUR

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:43.578
SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:49.317
INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE. TO

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:51.520
PROMOTE STUDY ABROAD FOR OUR

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.120
STUDENTS IN MEXICO AND I'LL

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:55.357
TELL YOU WHY. THERE'S THREE

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:55.957
CENTERS THREE CITIES IN SPAIN

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.626
WHERE EVEN LATINOS EVEN HE

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.528
CONDOS RATHER TO GO TO STUDY

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.663
SPANISH AS SOMEBODY WAS TELLING

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:02.264
ME EARLIER THIS MORNING THAT.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.698
BUT FEEL WAS TELLING ME THAT

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:05.467
THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.269
SWINTON'S DINNERS SPANISH IN IN

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.571
IN IN SPAIN. AND THEN YOU COME

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.238
BACK SPEAKING IN A RARE HER IS

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:13.275
NOT THE CULTURAL CONTEXT IS NOT

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.343
THE KIND OF SPANISH. THAT WE

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.546
ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE IN THE

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.681
CLASSROOM AS TEACHERS OR IN ANY

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.416
PROFESSIONAL FEEL. SO NOT

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:25.387
WITHSTANDING THIS REALITY BACK

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.455
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. ASSEMBLY

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.524
MEMBERS CLOSEST ONE AUDIO AND

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.626
GIVE IT KNOWN WHO HAVE NOW BOTH

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.361
ARE I DON'T I DON'T THE

ONE FORTY SIX. THEY RECOGNIZE

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:45.607
THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO PROJECT

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.509
THAT I STAB US A CAL STATE LONG

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:51.379
BEACH BUT ALSO THE DIRECTED FOR

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:51.947
THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BE

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:55.383
YOURS TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. IT

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.319
REPORT CAUGHT ON CALIFORNIA

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.321
MAKES YOU STUDY BETTER PROGRAMS

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.456
JUST BE NORMAL IS. MORE THAN

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.325
TEN YEARS AND I WILL CALL UPON

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:03.959
THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SENATORS

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:07.329
THAT HERE TO RE VISIT THAT AND

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.531
TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE. FOR

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.600
THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.668
TO UP THE SPEAKERS HOW ARE WE

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:17.472
DOING AND NOT ONLY CAL STATE

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.541
BUT YET THE UC AND THE

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:20.108
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:31.453
THERE'S GREAT. LESSONS TO BE.

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.087
LEARNED FROM THAT THAT RESEARCH

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:39.728
THAT WAS DONE. AND I USE WHEN

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:40.362
IT COME THROUGH BECAUSE I KNOW

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:41.596
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MORE

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:42.230
THAN THE FIVE MINUTES ALLOCATED

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:45.867
THE REPORT IS. POINTS TO A LOT

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:49.671
OF THE- OBVIOUS. DEVELOPMENT

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:50.272
RESOURCES NEED TO BE APPLIED

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.873
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:52.474
FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.543
THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. THE

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.679
WAVE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.481
THE GOVERNOR IS LEANING. AT

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.416
THIS POINT IS A FANTASTIC

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:02.017
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:05.420
TO EXPAND COLLABORATION WITH

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:06.021
CAL FOR COMPETING CALIFORNIA

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.656
MEXICO'S COLLEGES AND

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.758
UNIVERSITIES IT IS ALSO A GREAT

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:13.461
OPPORTUNITY TO CONVENE A

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:15.430
CONFERENCE THAT COULD DEVELOP

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:19.434
JOIN UP I MEAN AND- VENTURES

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.703
THAT COULD EXPAND THIS ACADEMIC

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.772
EXCHANGE. AND THEN ALSO THE

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:25.840
FACT THAT WHAT WE NEED IS TO

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:27.809
DEVELOP GREATER COLLABORATION

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.811
BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS TO

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:35.450
EXCHANGE FACULTY AND STUDENTS

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:36.084
HAVE FOR THAT I ALSO PROPOSE IN

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:39.521
THIS PAPER. THE CONSTABLE BY

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:40.088
ONE TO ONE EXCHANGE BETWEEN

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.456
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:42.023
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU CAN

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.625
ELIMINATE THE OUT OF STATE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.627
TUITION. IF YOU WISH EXCHANGE

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:47.696
STUDENT FROM A MEXICAN

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:49.798
UNIVERSITY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:53.501
INSTITUTION NEITHER ONE HAS TO

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.570
PAY FOR OUT OF STATE TUITION

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.539
BUT AGAIN THESE ARE LONG TERM

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:58.173
IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:01.476
ARE IN THE PAPER. AND AGAIN I

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:02.077

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:22.349
THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF. REAL

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:26.353
ESTATE IN OUR COUNTY. THAT

MOUNTAIN RANGE AND SO THE

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.674
GEOGRAPHY. IN SENEGAL MAKES IT

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:50.277
VERY HARD TO CITE AN AIRPORT.

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:50.878
WHICH MEANS THE RIGHT NOW SAN

DIEGO IS THE BUSIEST ONE RUNWAY

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:56.250

CREATE A SERVICE THAT IS NOT

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:53.146
BILINGUAL BUT BY CULTURE OUT.

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:55.115
IT WE REALLY DO UNDERSTAND

01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:57.117
THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVEN

01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:57.717
IF WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:01.621
SO A ONE THING THAT A WITH

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.256
THESE VERY PROFOUNDLY IT'S A

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.358
STUDY IN THE STATES. TO

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:09.362
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHICH ONES WERE

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:09.929
THE PILLARS TO CREATE THIS

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:11.564
BUSINESS. AND ONE OF THE MOST

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:13.500
IMPORTANT ONES IS REALLY

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:17.437
INTEGRATING THE SERVICE AMONG

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:21.408
THREE SOME AND MEDICAL. WHEN

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.008
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THREE

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:25.345
SOME WE KNOW IT'S ADVENTURES. I

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.614
DON'T HAVE DON'T WORRY NO WORRY

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:29.649
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TO

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:31.551
RESUME ITS ADVENTURE WHEN YOU

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:35.255
TOOK OUT A TALK ABOUT MEDICAL.

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:39.292
A PEOPLE FEEL VULNERABLE SO IT

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.161
LOOKS LIKE THE VERY OPPOSITE

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:45.365
TORCHED WORDS TO PUT TOGETHER.

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:47.634
SO THE PEELER SAID WE FIND OUT

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.469
THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT IS

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.671
THAT THE PATIENTS IN THE STATES

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:53.373
REALLY WANT TO HAVE AN

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:53.940
INTEGRATED SERVICE SOMEBODY

01:51:54.007 --> 01:51:55.575
THAT FULLY ADVOCATES FOR THEM

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.410
AND RESPOND FOR THEM. RIGHT NOW

01:51:57.477 --> 01:52:01.381
A SOME COMPANIES AS SEEMS ARE

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:01.981
DOING AMAZINGLY BECAUSE THEY

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:07.320
INTEGRATE SERVICES BUT IT'S NOT

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:07.854
THE REALITY OF HOW THIS IS

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:09.389
HAPPENING IN MEXICO. SO ONE

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:11.624
THING THAT WE NEED TO CREATE IS

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.560
REALLY THE QUALITY THAT YOU

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:17.430
EXPECT US AT AM AMERICAN

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:19.365
