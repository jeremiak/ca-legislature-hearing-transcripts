BUT WITH THAT WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP IN THE DIRECTION TO GET CALIFORNIA CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL LAW ON THE CULTIVATION OF HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE SPEAKING SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. VISION UP PEOPLE'S. SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KILLERS FROM CALIFORNIA FROM HERE AND TRANSPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PEOPLE SUPPORT PEOPLE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MATTER CHAIRMAN CLIFF BURKE HERE IN BEHALF OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS BILL AND FOR US THE ISSUE WHICH IS MENTIONED EARLIER IS LOCAL CONTROL -- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROLE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS. AND WILES AMENDMENTS WERE PUT IN IN JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH THEY WERE NOT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE. WERE GOING TO BE ADOPTED OR ON THE TABLE OUR LETTER INDICATES OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY TO PRESERVE LOCAL CONTROL. AND WITHOUT STRONG PRESERVATION OF LOCAL CONTROL WE ARE CONCERNED THAT NEXT IN ESSENCE THIS COULD BE INTERPRETED TO OVERRIDE LOCAL ZONING AND PLANNING -- PROVISIONS AND THEREFORE -- THIS IS A FAIRLY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN OUR AREA AND WITHOUT THE STRONG PROTECTIONS -- WE ARE OPPOSED AT THIS TIME. YOUR MUCH NEXT PERSON'S BEGIN OPPOSITION. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS WAYNE RICHMOND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FOUNDATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF FOR SOME OF YOU I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PACKAGES TODAY BUT I HAVE DELIVERED PACKAGES THAT SPEAKS TO EXACTLY ARE ISSUE. WANT TO THANK SENATOR WILK FOR SUPPORTING -- HAMP IN THE STATE AND THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE SUPPORTED HIM WE WE GENERALLY SUPPORT THIS -- BUILT BUT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE REMOVING OF THE EXEMPTION FOR ESTABLISHED AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. SO FAR THIS STATE WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE ENABLE FARMERS TO ACTUALLY GROW HIM. UNDER RESEARCH CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE THINGS LIKE SEED VARIETIES THAT GROW WELL IN OUR MULTIPLE. MICRO CLIMATES THE PACKAGE THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU TODAY INCLUDES A SEVENTY PAGE SCIENTIFIC REPORT FROM ONE OF OUR FARMS IN VENTURA WHICH IS WELL KNOWN. BY THE CDFA AND THE U. S. A.. AND AS SUCH I HAVE A PICTURE HERE OF THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR FROM THE USDA VISITING OUR FARMS. IT'S IN YOUR PACKAGE. AND ALSO WE HAVE RECENTLY SIGNED AN AMMO YOU WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY TO HELP THEM BRING A AND PLANNED. TO THEIR COUNTY SO WE ARE PROVIDING A VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION. THE FARMERS THEMSELVES ARE ACTUALLY FINANCING THE FORMS OF THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT THE AT STAKE HERE. AND MY CONCERN IS IF THAT THIS GOES AWAY WE LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REAL RESEARCH UC DAVIS HAS BASICALLY ABROGATED THEIR POSITION ON THIS. DATE WE WORK CO SPONSORS WITH THEM OF THE US OF THE CAMP SUMMIT LAST NOVEMBER. THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE CONSORTIUM IN MAY AND SUDDENLY THAT -- WHICH WE WERE A WEEK AWAY FROM CONSUMMATING SUDDENLY BLEW UP TO OUR FARMERS ACTUALLY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY AS DID ALL OF THE OTHER FARMERS IN ALL OF THE OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THEIR STATE DEPARTMENTS OF CULTURE AND UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH OUR STATE IS YEARS BEHIND IN THAT. IT WOULD BE A TRAVESTY FOR OUR FARMERS TO HAVE THAT -- OPPORTUNITY CLOSED OUT TO THEM WE HAVE BEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS -- FOR A YEAR AND A HALF NOW. WE ACTUALLY ADDED SOMETHING TO FOURTEEN OH NINE THAT HELPED IN TERMS OF THE WILD WEST MISS IF YOU WILL OF THE PREVIOUS BILL. THAT REQUIRED NOTE. NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE AG OFFICES WE SUPPORTED THE GPS COORDINATES BEING ADDED SO THAT NOTICE WAS PROPERLY GIVEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TODAY OKAY [inaudible] THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRESS AS WE ALL OF A DO THE FOR IT SO IF ON THE FIRSTPART SO -- THE RURAL COUNTIES WE ARE GOING TO BE AS WE MOVE FORWARD TAKE AMENDENTS THAT ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THAT'S WHY THEY WANTED THAT TO GO ON THE RECORD SO THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. SENATE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IS IS LATE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE AMENDMENTS -- FIX THEIR CONCERNS BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY REAPPEAR IN THE SAME ISSUE SO HOPEFULLY AND COURSE. OF MISTER BERG KNOWS WHERE MY OFFICE IS SO WE CAN WE CAN WORK ON THAT TERMS OF THESE LAST QUESTIONS IT. THIS LAST NAME IS THE FIRST TIME I'M HEARING ANY OF THIS BUT I KNOW MISTER BURROUGHS IS IN A POSITION -- TO TO FOLLOW UP WITH AN ARTICULATE ON THAT YES SECTIONS EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED OF THE BILL DEALS WITH THE ESTABLISHED RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WHICH UNDER THE LAND OF BILL -- PUT A BROAD DEFINITION AND ALLOW -- RESEARCH UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAMS WITH BASED ON ANIMAL YEARS ANOTHER TYPES OF MORE INFORMAL AGREEMENTS AS WE PROGRESS WITH THE FARM BILL SPECIFICALLY A TWENTY FOURTEEN FARM BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FARM BILL. THOSE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WERE MORE TIGHTLY DEFINED AND SO IN MOST IT CLOSELY CLOSELY DEFINED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FARM BILL SO WHAT WE'VE DONE. IS ALLOW THOSE TO OPERATE UNTIL THE STATE PLANS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FARM BILL WHICH WOULD THEN DEFINE IT CONSISTENTLY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LAID OUT UNDER THE UNDER THEIR FARM BILL SECTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WONDER WHY. THE LANGUAGE IS IN THERE RIGHT NOW THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ENACTING THIS ACT. TO NEITHER LIMIT NOR PREVENT A CITY COUNTY OR CITY COUNTY FROM EXERCISING AS POLICE POWER AUTHORITY. UNDER THE SECTION SIX OF THE CONSTITUTION THE DOES THAT TO SANTA BARBARA. DOES THAT NOT FEEL LIKE IT PROVIDES THE GUARDRAILS YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN NO WE DO NOT THINK THAT'S THAT IS SUFFICIENT THAT INTENT LANGUAGES VISION THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE PROPOSED. WHICH IS CITED IN OUR LATER -- WE THINK IS NECESSARY YOUR SON OR SOME VARIATION THEIR ARMY WAS ON THE TABLE BY THE RURAL COUNTIES FOR WHATEVER REASON I BELIEVE IT WAS. REJECTED -- WE WERE TOLD AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATENESS OF OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE WERE TOLD WANT LITERALLY ON MONDAY THAT LANGUAGE WAS GOING IN. ARM THROUGH OUR LOCAL OFFICES. IN OUR LOCAL ACT COMMISSIONER AND SO WE ACTUALLY VOTED ON MONDAY TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BASED UPON THE AMENDMENTS AND WE ONLY LEARNED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THAT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. THAT WAS INTENDED FOR THE PROTECT THE LOCALS WAS NOT GOING IN AND THAT THAT INTENT LANGUAGE WAS -- WHAT WAS AGREED TO WHICH IT WAS NOT WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO REFER YOU KNOW TAKE THE POSITION WE ARE? TAKING WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT INTENT LANGUAGES VISION PROJECT LOCAL CONTROL AND SETTING UP A STATE PROGRAM HERE -- HAS THE IMPLICATION OF ERODING LOCAL CONTROL WITHOUT MAKING IT. IT IS CLEAR THAT THAT'S THAT IS. UP WITH THROUGH MORE DETAIL LANGUAGE SO -- WE WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER IN THE SPONSORS CONSIDER. INCLUDING OUR THE LANGUAGE OR SOME VARIANT THE AS WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BY THE ROLE COUNTIES. WE ARE TAKING THAT. WELL NO AND WHAT WHAT WHAT OKAY. BUT WE ARE STILL GOOD WE ARE STILL IN. TALKS WHY DON'T WE JUST HEARD A FROM THAT WE'VE AGREED TO I APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR BUT I MEAN WE WERE WE WERE. TOLD THE LOCAL ON MONDAY OKAY OKAY YOU GAVE MY NETWORK AT OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ALRIGHT BUT SO THAT'S A SO IT'S SORT OF SITUATION WE WERE TOLD ONE THING LEARN SOMETHING ELSE. AND OUR FOLKS DO NOT THINK IT'S SUFFICIENT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH I I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. COUNTY COULD GO AHEAD PASSED AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH SAYS THINGS [inaudible] ARM. I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS THAT THE STATE LEGISLATION COULD BE USED TO TRY TO PREEMPT THE COUNTY THE COUNTY'S ABILITY TO THROUGH ITS. PLANNING AND ALL RIGHT THERE ARE NO WORDS ON THIS AND OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT OUT OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR THANK YOU SO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION YOU WILL BE TAKING SOME OF THESE AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE IS JUST YEAH THE TIMING.

FOUND IN HIM FARMERS OF A HEARING IN THE STATES -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WE MOVE FORWARD AND TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL -- I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WONDER WHY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SOUTH LA'S ON THIS.

MATHIS SIGNED A GEAR CURRY CUNNINGHAM FLORA. FLORA I'D GRAY. IRWIN JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LEVINE. LEVINE HI ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS SIZE SALAS [inaudible] SALAS SIGN. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHILE YOU'RE HERE MISTER WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IS BE TWO OH TWO AFTER THAT LAST ONE I'M NOT SURE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. YEAH WHAT'S. THAT MAY COME UP OKAY GRATEFUL PERFECT AND WE GOT DOCTOR ALWAYS MOVE A LITTLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND APPRECIATE THAT FROM THE VICE CHAIR TO START I WANT TO THANK YOU AND ALL YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE FOR THE GREAT WORK. I KNOW ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ACCEPT ALL THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THESE MEMBERS HELP MOVE THE BILL FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT I'VE HAD AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ANIMAL BLOOD BANK. WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THAT LANGUAGE TODAY I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE ALL PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF THEIR ANIMAL OWNERS IS PROTECTED FROM DISCLOSURE? I SB TWO OH TWO IS A VERY SIMPLE YET NECESSARY FIX TO SERIOUS PROBLEMS FACING THE VETERINARY MEDICAL COMMUNITY. THEN THERE IT VETERINARIANS ARE FACING A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF BLOOD RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS MOST OF THE NATION. THE EXISTING BLOOD BANKS SIMPLY ARE PROVIDING ENOUGH FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL THIS IS ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF ANIMALS WHO NEED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. IN MANY CASES THE ALTERNATIVE. ALTERNATE TO A TRANSFUSION IS DEATH -- ANYBODY DOUBTS THAT IF YOU KNOW ROBIN BLACK SHE AN EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR. DODD WAS ILL WAS AT THE DEAD HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- NEED A BLOOD TRANSFUSION DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PLASMA. CLOSEST PLACE WAS IN DAVIS SO SHE FRANTICALLY DROVE OUT AND HER DOG PASSED IN HER FRONT SEAT ON THE DRIVE TO DAVIS. SB TWO OH TWO ALLOWS FOR THE COMMERCIAL LICENSURE OF COMMUNITY COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS MEETING PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER THEIR PETS TO GIVE BLOOD. THIS JUST LIKE THE WAY PEOPLE GIVE BLOOD WE GO WHEN WE DONATE WE GO BACK HOME. SURPRISINGLY THIS IS A LEGAL FOR ANIMALS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH ALL FORTY NINE OTHER STATES ALLOW IT. IN THIS STATE ANIMALS MUST BE KEPT CRIMINALLY HOUSED ON PREMISES TO DONATE BLOOD. OTHERWISE THE FACILITY CANNOT BE LICENSED SB TWO OH TWO ALLOWS EXIST. TO EXIST AS THEY ARE BUT ALSO MAKES FOR A NEW COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS WHICH WILL OPERATE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE VETERINARIAN. THIS ONE CLUE THIS ONE CREASES SUPPLY A RUN A BLOOD PRODUCTS ENSURE HEALTHY HAPPY PETS EVERYWHERE. THIS IS AN EASY AND COMMONSENSE REFORM BUT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE THE CHANGES NOW -- I HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES AND I WILL GO UP GO AHEAD AND ALLOW THEM TO SELF IDENTIFY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHICH PERSONS GOOD MORNING I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION. I SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD FOR OVER EIGHT YEARS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ALONG WITH SENATOR WILK STAFF AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. WITH INPUT FROM DR -- INS AND PROFESSIONALS FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE THIS BILL GOOD FOR ALL PARTIES FOR THE BLOOD BANKS FOR CONSUMERS CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS AND FOR DONOR AND RECIPIENT ANIMALS. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS WILL ADD TO THE MUCH NEEDED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY IN THE STATE AS SENATOR WILK STATED. AS WELL AS MATCHING OTHER STATES BY NOT KEEPING ANIMALS IN CAGES JUST TO BELIEVE THEM AND IT OPENS UP A REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE VETERINARIANS AROUND THE STATE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HUMANE TYPE OF PRACTICE THANK YOU FOR COULD YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY AND WE HOPE TO HAVE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PERSON SPEAKING IN SUPPORT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING? MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHAUNA ONCE I'M HERE AS A CITIZEN TODAY BUT I DO MY DAY JOB I AM A DAVIS THE SCHOOL THAT OUR MEDICINE. AND I'M ALSO THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE UC DAVIS BETTER BLOOD BANK -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN WE STARTED OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE COLLECTED BLOOD FROM OVER. FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND ANIMALS THAT ARE OWNED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE'VE TRANSFUSED AT LEAST THAT MANY UNITS OF BLOOD. TO ANIMALS COMING TO OUR FACILITY IN DIRE NEED OF TRANSFUSION SERVICES. IN THAT TIME WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE DONATION PROCESS. FOR WE HAVE NEVER TRANSMITTED A TRANSFUSION TREADMILL TRANSMITTED DISEASE TO RECIPIENT OF THOSE BLOOD PRODUCTS. OUR INTENT WHEN WE STARTED THE PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A MODEL PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUCH THAT LEGISLATION SUCH AS AS SENATOR WORKERS PUT FORTH. THAT COULD BE THE MODEL FOR HELP THE STATE COULD MOVE FORWARD. AS A SENATOR WHAT SAID ALL FORTY NINE OTHER STATES ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS IT IS RIGHT IT IS GOOD IT IS GOOD MEDICINE IT'S GOOD PRACTICE. AND I CERTAINLY KNOW ONE THING IS THAT. I'VE WAITED FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THIS LEGISLATION COME FOR NIGHT I AM HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THIS -- I'VE BEEN IN TRANSFUSION MEDICINE BUT WELL FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND HAVE HAVE HOPE FOR THIS DAY FOR A LONG TIME. IF THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD I CAN TELL YOU BY THE END OF THE YEAR DOGS WILL DIE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR LACK OF BLOOD PRODUCTS. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IF THIS LEGISLATION DOES MOVE FORWARD THAT QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WILL MOVE INTO THIS THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPACE THE CREATE BLOOD PRODUCTS. BLOOD BANKS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY DOGS LIVES WILL BE SAVED. COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE THE PROCESS OF HAVING THEIR ANIMALS DONATE BLOOD [inaudible] AND IT. THE FINAL ANALYSIS VETERINARIANS WILL HAVE THE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO SAVE PEOPLE'S. ANIMALS LIVES AND SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLUS PERSONS BEING BRIEFLY PLEASE YES MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT SOCIAL QUESTION LEGISLATION I'M JUST HERE TO HELP WITH ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE BILL LANGUAGE ITSELF.

MEMBERS MIKE DEALER REPRESENT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR IN YOUR ACCENT CONSULTANT VICTOR FRANK RICH FOR WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES ON THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ERIN EVANS ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHEN YOU PROP CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WERE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS PIECE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY PEOPLE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JEFFREY LEE **** OF GREENBERG TRAURIG ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK. THANK -- THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR -- IN ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS BILL TO GET IT TO THIS POINT. IF I COULD JUST SPEAKA MINUTE TO SOME OF THE BACKGROUND AND SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE. A LIKE ROBIN BLACK THE FOUNDER OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK LOST HER OWN ANIMAL -- WHEN THERE WAS NO BLOOD AVAILABLE FOR TRANSFUSION -- HER NAME IS PAT KAUFMAN. SHE DESERVES SOME RECOGNITION FOR HAVING PIONEERED THIS AREA. AT KAUFMAN -- WHEN ABOUT AFTER THAT HAPPENED AND ESTABLISHED THE FIRST ANIMAL BLOOD BANK LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA? THAT'S WHAT SHE DID TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND SINCE THEN I WOULD AGREE WITH DR -- AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ANIMAL LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED IN THIS STATE AND ELSEWHERE BECAUSE OF THAT. ALL FORTY NINE STATES DO PERMIT COMMUNITY SOURCE DONORS. ALL FORTY NINE STATES ALSO PERMIT COLONY BASED. BLOOD BANKS. AND MANY EXIST OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. COLONY BASED BLOOD BANKS HAVE HAPPY HEALTHY DONORS WHO PRODUCE THE SAFEST HIGHEST QUALITY BLOOD. THAT'S TRUE NOW AND IT'S GOOD TO BE TRUE WITH COMMUNITY SORTS DONORS AVAILABLE. HOWEVER THERE IS A SHORTAGE WE ALL AGREE ON THAT AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE AND WELCOME COMMUNITY SOURCE DONORS TO THE POOL BECAUSE WE NEED THAT BLOOD. ON THE ISSUE OF THE P. I. WHAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE. IS -- THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF THE BILL PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF COMMUNITY SOURCED. ANIMAL DONORS THE OWNERS OF COMMUNITY SOURCE ANIMAL DONORS -- WERE ALSO TOLD THAT EXISTING LAW AND THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WOULD PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. OF COLONY BASED ANIMAL DONORS AND THE AMENDMENT WE'VE ASKED FOR IS JUST TO MAKE CLEAR IN THE BILL WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD IS CLEAR IN THE LAW. THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE AMENDMENT YOU ELIMINATE THE TWO WORDS COMMUNITY SOURCED IN THE BILL. AND WE PROTECT ALL OF THE ANIMAL OWNERS AT THAT IS NECESSARY WE KNEW IT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY CLIENT WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN TOWARD ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE PROVEN COMPLETELY FALSE AND WE THOUGHT AGAIN RECENTLY. WHEN THE OTHER BLOOD BANK -- HIM A PAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF ALSO AND TOWARD ALLEGATIONS AND WE'VE SEEN IT RECENTLY IN CINEMA COUNTY. WITH SIX HUNDRED ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS STORMED A DUCK FARM A HUNDRED OF THEM WERE ARRESTED SO WE APPRECIATE -- EVERYONE'S HELP IN MOVING FORWARD -- TO AVOID THAT PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY. OKAY -- FOR WE GET QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD OKAY SO YOU ARE GONNA BE TAKING THE AMENDMENT TO SEDATE DECK INDIVIDUALS OKAY SO IT IS EVERYBODY NOT ONE FROM ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER SO. IT OFF OKAY OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WE ALL HEARD THAT AS ITS MOVE FORWARD OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IN JUST REAL QUICKLY I THINK YOU EXPLAINED IT TO ME IN MY OFFICE OF WHEN WE CALL WE TALK ABOUT ANIMALS OF VOLUNTEERING GIVING THEIR BLOOD TO A WAVE DECAY -- THEY LIKE YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'VE. TERRACE [inaudible] GIVING BLOOD. YES THAT WOULD YOU ASKED ME OUT FROM THE CITY I DON'T I'M NOT FROM A RURAL AREAS I DON'T. THINK THAT WAS BY FAR THE BEST QUESTIONS I'VE EVER BEEN ASKED -- AND PROBABLY THIS THE THE SALLY QUESTION. SO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE STANDARD OF CARE IN UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW FOR A COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD DONORS -- CANINE DONORS IS THEY'RE VIEWED ALIVE IN SIMILAR WAYS TO SEARCH AND RESCUE DOGS OR CANINE COMPANION DOGS THAT -- SOMEWHAT SELF SELECT IN ORDER TO BE A DONOR BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. OF THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THEIR ASSESSMENT BY A TRAIN BETTER PROFESSIONAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE AMENABLE TO THE PROCESS IS IS SORT OF THE STANDARD OF CARE -- AT OUR FACILITY -- PROXIMATE 10215% OF DOGS WASH OUT OF OUR PROGRAMMING THEY COME THEY DEMONSTRATE IN A MANNER -- AS WE'RE WORKING SLOWLY THROUGHOUT SCREENING THEM TO BE A DONOR IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS WE THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR TIME AND WISH THAT WE CAN HELP THEM BUT THEIR DOGS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED TO US -- BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. AND MOVING FORWARD THAT WOULD BE -- WHAT I WOULD HOPE AS NEW ENTREPRENEURS COME INTO THE FIELD AS THEY WOULD ADOPT THOSE BEST PRACTICES TO UNDERSTAND THAT? IN ORDER TO IF YOU DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY THE COMMUNITIES ENGAGED. AND THE DOGS ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU BILL GREAT QUESTION. GLAD YOU'RE NOT. GOING BY A BARKER ME OUT NO. NO NO NO. NO NO YEAH I WAS ONE OF MY ISSUES TO AS A AS A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER. DOGS CANNOT GIVE INFORMED CONSENT IS ALWAYS BEEN IN THIS BECAUSE LAW THAT'S A BILL YOU AND I DO TOGETHER. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] GOOD. SIR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AT TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD -- BUT ALSO -- WITH THE CONCERN OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH ANIMAL BLOOD WITHIN THE STATE -- ALSO LOOKING MAYBE OPENING IT UP FOR TAKING OUT OF STATE BLOOD -- SO LONG AS IT MEETS THE STANDARDS REQUIRED -- THAT WAY WE CAN ENSURE THINGS LIKE HAPPEN -- TO ROBIN BLACK AND OTHER FAMILIES -- DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THAT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT GOING FORWARD GREAT THANK YOU. SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO ROBIN BLACK I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT IT TO OUR STORY BEFORE IS TOLD IT KIND MADE FAMOUS THIS MORNING BUT THE FIRST. FOUR ONE SIX SEVEN OKAY. OKAY THE AND THAT'S A GREAT IDEA FOR FOR ANOTHER BILL. I OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] FIVE YEAH. THEY WERE IRATE AFTER. THAT -- LAST YEAR. WHAT OPTION THEN [inaudible] YEAH -- OF COURSE THAT IS WE WILL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH YEAH. WE HAVE AN ULCER. GOOD MORNING SENATOR -- HERE TO PRESENT. SB. FIVE TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I THANK YOU VERY THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW CANNABIS IN INDUSTRIAL HEMP CULTIVATORS. TO RECEIVE THE SAME PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT AND RELIEF. AS AT OTHER AGRICULTURAL SECTORS IN THE STATE BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO THE WOOD WILLIAMSON ACT. WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE IN THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THESE AMENDMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTING THEM TODAY? THE CALIFORNIA LAND CONSERVATION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE ALSO KNOWN AS THE WILLIAMS AN ACT ESTABLISH A MEANS OF PROTECTING AGRICULTURAL. AND OPEN SPACE LAND BY REDUCING THE BURDENS IMPOSED BY RISING PROPERTY TAX RATES. THE ACT ALLOWS PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO INTER INTER COULD INTO CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO VOLUNTARILY RESTRICT THEIR LAND TO AGRICULTURAL AND COMPATIBLE OPEN SPACE USES. THIS RESULTS IN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS WHICH ARE BASED UPON INCOME GENERATED RATHER THAN POTENTIAL MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE WILLIAMSON ACT SAGE AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS ANYWHERE FROM 2275% OF PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY. EACH YEAR HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THEIR DISCRETION ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH AG PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TAX SAVINGS. FOR EXAMPLE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS EXPELLED EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED AS INCOMPATIBLE AGRICULTURAL USE OF LAND WHERE ITS CULTIVATION OF CROPS SUCH AS FRUIT. AND NUTS -- PLANT PRODUCTS AN ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE ALL CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE. SB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND PROVIDE THAT THE CULTIVATION OF CANNABIS PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TYPES OF CULTIVATOR LICENSES. ISSUED THROUGH THE MEDICAL AN ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. IS IS A COMPATIBLE LAND USE AND UNDER THE WILLIAMSON ACT CONTRACT IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE INCLUDE CANNABIS CULTIVATORS SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE THE SAME TAX ASSESSMENTS AS OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. SB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP. TO ACHIEVE THIS A EQUITY -- WITH ME TODAY IS CASE YEAR CONNOR FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND PAUL SMITH FROM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUSAN SPEAKING AT PORT PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FIONA MOCKS. PROUD TO BE HERE AS A SPONSOR OF SB -- FIVE TWENTY SEVEN AS PREVIOUSLY STATED SB FIVE POINT SEVEN SIMPLY CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW THAT CANNABIS AND HEMP CULTIVATORS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT RELIEFAS OTHER AG. IN THE STATE BY INCORPORATED IN THE BLAMES AN ACT WITH CANNABIS AS COMPATIBLE USE ONLY AND HELP AS COMPATIBLE OR AG USE AS PER THE DISTRICT ALLOWS. IN THE TREASURES TIME SERVING ON THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE NEWLY LEGALIZED REGULATED PRODUCTS. OF HAVE BEEN CANNABIS AND WHETHER THEY HAVE A PLACE IN THE WILLIAMON ACT AND OUR CONVERSATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WHICH WOULD MAKE CLEAR THEY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL. WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING WITH THEM -- RATHER HAVE BEEN CANNABIS INDUSTRIES WE LEARNED THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION AS TO HOW THESE PRODUCTS INTERSECT WITH THE WILLIAMS ACT. SO WITH THE HIGH TAXES ALREADY AROUND CANNABIS AND SEEING LAST ENTRY INTO THE REGULATED MARKET AS CALIFORNIA PREDICTED THE TREASURE AND STAKEHOLDERS DISCUSSED UNIQUE WAYS TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE MORE CANNABIS CULTIVATORS. ENTERING INTO THE LEGAL MARKET WE BELIEVE CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW THAT SAYS FARMERS CAN INCORPORATE CANNABIS AS A COMPATIBLE USE FOR THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WILL GIVE THEM GREATER AND SPENT A INCENTIVE TO EXPAND LEGAL OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. SB FIVE POINT SEVEN SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT CANNABIS IS COMPATIBLE USE ONLY HEMP CANDY CONCERT AGRICULTURAL COMPATIBLE USE. AND THIS MEANS THAT FARMERS WHO GROW ANOTHER APPROVED CROP ON WILLIAMS ACTUALLY AND CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO GROW LEGAL CANNABIS AND THE COUNTY ASSESSOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INCLUDE THEIR APPRAISAL OF THE LAND. ONLY IN COUNTIES THAT ARE ACCEPTING Là EVEN ACT APPLICATIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE CURRENT LAW IT SIMPLY CLARIFIES UP FOR THE COUNTIES AND THE ASSESSORS TO UNDERSTAND THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BENJAMIN MEMBERS PAUL SMITH WITH THE RURAL COUNTIES AGAIN WE REPRESENT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THOSE RURAL COUNTIES IT IS OUR MEMBERS WHO MAKE OF THESE CLAIMS AND ACT CONTRACTS AND I WERE GOING VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. AND WE'RE ALSO VERY PLEASED WITH THE CONSTRUCT OF THE BILL IS MADE MAKING SURE THAT IT IS IN FACT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO ULTIMATELY MAKE THAT DECISION -- THROUGH AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE -- BY THE BY ABOARD SO WE REALLY -- APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS BILL AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT SPORT.

ALL RIGHT -- CENTER DODD YOU'RE UP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FORMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM. BUILDING MOVED AND SECONDED -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAY CULTURE. TO ESTABLISH THE MINISTER AND INSTEAD OF BATES CONSERVATION PROGRAM. LET ME BEGIN BY FIRST SAME WILL ACCEPT -- I I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN THE IN THE BILL ANALYSIS -- SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE WILDLIFE HABITAT WHILE SUPPORTING. ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THROUGH INCENTIVES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS. AND RANCHERS -- THE MAJOR DECISIONS A CONSERVATION PRACTICE OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS. CAN BE DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED -- DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND PROVIDE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND SOCIAL BENEFITS. IN RECENT YEARS THE DELIVERY OF ON FARM PRACTICES HAS DECLINED THE CLIENT IS DRIVEN BY THE RISING COST OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION INCLUDING WATER AND ENERGY. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROVIDE MULTIPLE CONSERVATION BET BENEFITS. THROUGH ON FARM PRACTICES. THE PURPOSE OF THE INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDEASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE WILDLIFE FRIENDLY IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR LET. UPON A FUTURE APPROPRIATION THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AG WORKER AG PRODUCERS SKEWS ME WHO CREATE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT IT PROVIDE ADDED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER QUALITY ROSA CONTROL. A CONCISE CONSERVED -- GROUNDWATER YES BE TWO FIFTY THREE CLEARLY. INSTRUCTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THAT I WHAT I'M GOING TO REPEAT THIS THE STATE'S INSURED THE INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM. COMPLIMENTS AND NOT SUB PLANTS IN THE OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS SB TWO FIFTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHICH IS HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST PERSON SPEAKING IN SUPPORT PLEASE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCE BURKE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB ARE SB. TWO FIFTY THREE OF CALIFORNIA'S APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED MILLION ACRES FORTY THREE MILLION ACRES ARGUES FOR AGRICULTURE AND HE'S WORKING FARMS AND RANCHES PRODUCE MUCH OF THE COUNTRY'S FOOD AND FIBER. HE'S WORKING LAND ALSO PROVIDE MUCH OF OUR STATES OPEN SPACE AND THE HABITATS THAT WILDLIFE NEED. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW PROGRAM PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LAND. WITH THE HELP FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM CREATED SB TWO FIFTY THREE PRODUCES WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ON FARM PRACTICES THAT DELIVER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER AND AIR QUALITY. CONSERVE WATER GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER AND CREATE WILDLIFE HABITAT. SOMEBODY'S HABITAT PROJECTS COULD INCLUDE WILDLIFE FRIENDLY FENCING FOR SAFE WILDLIFE MOVEMENT OR FLOODING RICEVILLE FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT. IN THE RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE DELIVERY OF ON FARM CONSERVATION PRACTICES DECLINE FOR EXAMPLE SOME DAYS DURING THE DROUGHT WE SAW A 100%. OF BE CONSERVATION PRACTICES AND HABITAT DELIVERED BY OUR FOR OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROVIDE MULTIPLE CONSERVATION BENEFITS TO ON FARM PRACTICES. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WITH SUPPORT SCIENCE DRIVEN INVESTMENTS THAT DELIVER BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT CAN BE REASONABLY EXPECTED THAT LENDERS CAN PROVIDE ON THEIR OWN. AND WE URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PERSONS BECAUSE FOR PLEASE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MARK FRIENDSTER MAKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TWO FIFTY THREE IN A RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS WERE CREATED BACK IN THE DUST BOWL ERA -- TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES BERMAN AGRICULTURAL NATIONAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE AND WE'VE REALLY BENEFITED FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH OUR CS. AND WORK WITH THEM IN SOME OTHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH FACILITATES AMMAN FARM PRACTICES THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT SENATOR DODD AND MISS FORSBERG SPOKE -- TO WHAT WE SEE THIS BILL DOING IS CREATING A STAY ANALOG TO AN RC ASPER A PROCESS. AND WILL GIVE US MORE TOOLS SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT MATCHES OUR UNIQUE AGRA KANA ME. THERE ARE SOME PRACTICES THAT I THINK WE WOULD. LIKE TO SEE THE STATE FACILITATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIMPLY CANNOT. ARM. AND WE'RE RELEASED APPRECIATIVE OF CENTER DOT FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE PEOPLE SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLACE NAME AFFILIATION AS MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERION WARMER DOWN ON BEHALF OF RURAL COUNTIES HOME TO MANY OF THESE WILDLIFE AREAS. AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE OF THE MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE PEOPLE SPEAK AND SUPPORT PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS REBEKAH BASQUE AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PEOPLE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DAY RUN SEND POLICY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY LINES WITH FAMILY FARMERS. AND I WANT TO BE HERE SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- BUT I HAVE TO PROBLEMS AND CENTER DOT IS BY SENATOR SO I I'M I'M NOT AT ALL HAPPY TO BE IN THIS POSITION -- SO DESPITE THE INCLUSION OF THIS AMENDMENT THAT SENATOR DODD -- TALKED ABOUT -- WHICH SAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ENSURE THE PROGRAM COMPLIMENTS AND DOES NOT SUPPLANT EXISTING PROGRAM. THE BILL STILL REQUIRE CDFA TO ADOPT ALL AND ARTS YES PRACTICES THAT ARE APPLICABLES TO CALIFORNIA. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE ALL THE PRACTICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THIS WEEK PROGRAM THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. THEY'RE ALL APPLICABLES TO CALIFORNIA -- WHY NOT LET CDF A CHOOSE WHICH PRACTICES ARE MOST APPROPRIATE TO THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM -- HALF OF THE N. RCS A QUICK MONEY FOR INSTANCE GOES TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TYPES OF THINGS THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WILDLIFE HABITAT. AND MY SECOND POINT IS THAT THE BILL SAYS THE DEPARTMENT MAY GIVE PRIORITY TO PROJECT THAT OCCUR IN AND BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BUT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR AB. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WHEN THAT SPELLS OUT HOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR HEALTHY SOILS SWEET? AND ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. INCLUDING TARGETING SMALLER FARMS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED ACRES AND SETTING ASIDE 25% OF FUNDS FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE. FARMERS WHICH THAT FORMER EQUITY ACTIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY DEFINED AS FARMERS OF COLOR. IF SB TWO FIFTY THREE IS NOT AMENDED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THIS THEN IT REQUIRES CDFA TO CONTRACT WITH THE ARE JUST SEE DIS BUT DOESN'T OBLIGATE THEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR FARMERS OF COLOR. AND IT WILL INCLUDE ALL OF THE SAME PRACTICES AS THE ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS SO THERE'S TWO THINGS HERE THAT NEED TO BE AMENDED IN SOME WAY. AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING -- TO TALK TO THE SPONSORS AND TO CENTER DOT ABOUT THIS BUT WE'RE STILL STUCK HERE. THANK YOU NEXT PERSONS BEGIN OPPOSITION PLACE GENERAL POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE IN AGRICULTURE NETWORK -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE ARE ALSO IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION -- IF SB TWO FIVE THREE HAD BEEN BEFORE US BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE I THINK WE WOULD HAVE EMBRACE IT MORE HOLY BECAUSE THE STATE WAS NOT IN A POSITION OF PROVIDING INCENTIVES OR TECHNICAL SYSTEMS FOR FARMERS. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING PRACTICES -- BUT GIVEN THE FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GIVEN THE NEEDS TO WORK WITH -- PRODUCERS TO ADDRESS -- GREATER WEATHER EXTREMES IMPROVE CARBON SINKS SAVE WATER AND ENERGY WE NOW HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST SUITE OF CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE CURRENTLY SB -- TWO FIVE THREE WE BELIEVE FAILS TO BE COMPLEMENTARY TO AND NOT TO PLAY COULD HAVE OF THOSE EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE BEEN. IN CONVERSATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL'S INTRODUCTION WITH THE SPONSORS AND WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY AND FIND AMENDMENTS -- WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT THERE'S A ESPECIALLY IN NEED TO HAVE A STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS SO THEY'RE NOT WORK WE'RE NOT CREATING A COMPLEX SYSTEM FOR FARMERS. ON THE GROUND ALSO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IN TWO FIVE THREE IS IS IT A WILDLIFE HABITAT BILL IS IT A CLIMATE CHANGE BILL WHY ARE WE CREATING IF IT IS CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE EXISTING CLAIM IT'S MORE LIKE A CULTURE PROGRAMS -- HOW CAN WE DO A BETTER JOB OF BEING COMPLIMENTARY TO THOSE CURRENT EFFORTS AND NOT DUPLICATIVE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN SO WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN SEEING GREATER INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AS THE BILL LAYS OUT -- BUT CAN'T SUPPORT THE EFFORT CURRENTLY UNTIL WE GET SOME AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THAT REALLY SEEKS TO IMPROVE -- PROGRAM COORDINATION ACROSS THE BOARD THANK YOU OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY. OKAY BEFORE WE GET QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE SO AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD WHEN YOU'RE OPPOSITION IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. USE THAT TELLS YOU THAT YOU'RE STILL IN CONVERSATION. WHAT IT RESPONDED THAT SECOND? PART THAT. YES SO WE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH ASSEMBLY AFTER RESOURCES AND ASSEMBLY ATTIC ON FIXING THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LANGUAGE TO TRY TO ADDRESS WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM BOTH AS A MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. THAT'S A NUMBER IRWIN -- AND SO WE ARE COPING ADDRESS THAT AND APPROPRIATIONS. OKAY TO THE TO THE INTENT IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. OKAY OKAY -- OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS A WORKER SO I APPRECIATE YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE DISPATCH FARMERS DEFINITION MAKING SURE WE WORK ON THAT WE WERE TAUGHT ON THE BILL. MY CONCERN AND I'VE TRIED. TO FIND IT IN HERE BUT HOW IN SENATORS -- HOW THE INCENTIVES CAME ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CALCULATIONS I WANT TO WARN YOU? IF CALLUM BEIRA SCREEN SHOWS ITS UGLY HEAD IN THIS I WILL NOT VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR. BECAUSE I'VE HAD THE SLIP BY A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW AND I'M ALWAYS THE ONLY NO VOTE ON THE FLOOR BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M I'M REALLY ADAMANT. THAT WE ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE KIND OF CALCULATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT I THINK WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BY CITING FOOD AND COAT FIVE TWELVE WHICH IS. A THAT THE BILL THAT YOU RAN LAST YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE. HI FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW CALAVERAS GREEN EXCLUDES SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CLEAN AIR BUT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY SO -- WE APPRECIATE THE THE THE MEMBER FROM LAKE COUNTY HAVING [inaudible] COMMENTS.

THE BILL IS OUT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO AHEAD WITH YOU SENATOR PLEASE -- SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN SEAS. SIX FIFTY SEVEN ALL RIGHT. AS A DISTRACTION THE THINGS THAT YOU THERE IS A TYPO ON MIND BY GLASSES ARE FINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SO SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY SEVEN AUTHORIZES THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER TO REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ON THE CONDITION. ACREAGE PRODUCTION IN VALUE OF CANNABIS THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THEIR ANNUAL CROP REPORT SUBMITTED. THIS IS VOLUNTARY IT ALLOWS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE SOME COUNTIES ARE FINDING THAT BECAUSE CANNABIS IS CURRENTLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL CROP REPORT. IT IS NOT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF A COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL CULTIVATION NORMALIZING CANNABIS IS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT WILL ENCOURAGE UNLICENSED GROWERS TO COME FORWARD BECOME LEGITIMATE. IT'D IN TAX PAYING BUSINESSES I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND ANY APPROPRIATE TIME AND WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE BILL WITH THIS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MOVED AND SECONDED PERSON RISEN PLACEMENT SUPPORT PLEASE SHARON MEMBERS ACTUALLY WALKER WITH NOT CEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF MONTEREY WHERE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF SB SIX FIVE SEVEN WHICH GIVES THE COUNTIES THE OPTION TO REPORT CANNABIS PRODUCTION DATA IN A SEPARATE. BUT SIMILAR MANNER TO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS CROP REPORTS MONTEREY COUNTY WAS HOME TO THE CUT FLOWERS INDUSTRY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. GLOBAL COMPETITION PARTICULARLY FROM LATIN AMERICA DECIMATED THAT MARKET AND NOT THAT DOWNTURN LEFT A BUNCH OF COLLAPSING GREENHOUSES WHICH PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN PUSHING THE LOCAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO OVER 11%. NOW MANY OF THOSE GREEN HOUSES ARE BLOOMING AGAIN AS CANNABIS PRODUCTION MOVES INTO MONTEREY COUNTY. THE COUNTY OF MODERATE OFFICIALS PREDICTS THAT CANNABIS AGRICULTURE COULD BRING IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. A NEW TAX REVENUE SO THE COUNTY STRONGLY SUPPORTS LEGITIMIZING CANNABIS CULTIVATION AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE AND ALLOWING CANNABIS DATA TO BE REPORTED SIMILAR TO THE COUNTY'S ANNUAL CROP REPORT. HIGHLIGHTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CROP AND RELATED PRODUCTION DATA WILL HELP MONTEREY AND OTHER COUNTIES PROMOTE THIS AGRICULTURAL PORTFOLIO TO INVESTORS. SEEKING TO BACK RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS THROUGH DIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IN ADDITION NORMALIZING CANNABIS AS TRUE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WILL ENCOURAGE UNLICENSED GROWERS TO COME FORWARD AND BECOME LEGITIMATE PERMITTED. AND TAX PAYING BUSINESS AS MONTEREY COUNTY IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN THE PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS IN THE STATE. AND FOR THESE REASONS FOR SPONSORING SB SIX FIVE SEVEN THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS. IMPORTANT MEASURE AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PERSON SPEAKING SUPPORT PLEASE. PAUL BOWLES MOVED FROM TH OF REAL COUNTIES WEIRD STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CANNABIS PRODUCING COUNTIES IN OUR MEMBERSHIP WE SEE THIS AS A TOOL FOR BOTH THE MARKETING AS WELL AS BETTER ENFORCEMENT WE ENCOURAGE THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PERSON SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. ANYBODY SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TODAY. IN BETWEEN. HAVE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR SHE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK MISTER MONNING AND OTHER SPONSORS FOR WORKING THROUGH OUR ISSUES -- NAMELY IT'S IT'S ABOUT DESIGNATING THAT THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS IN A SEPARATE REPORT DISTINCT FROM AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. WE UNDERSTAND FROM MARKETING PERSPECTIVE THERE MAY BE VALUE INCOME MINGLING THOSE PRODUCTS AND AND HAVING THAT IDEA OF CANNABIS IS AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY BUT WE THINK STATE LAW WAS VERY PRESCRIPTIVE THAT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME -- AND IN DOING SO WE AGREE THAT DEVELOPING A SEPARATE PORT HAS VALUE -- BUT IT DOES NEED TO REMAIN SEPARATE SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] CHAIR. OF THANK YOU SENATOR FOR CARRYING THIS I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL DOES IT INCLUDE -- HAMP OR IS IT LIMITED TO CANNABIS JUST CANNABIS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL.
