AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY ONE WEBER. AND I ITEM SIX AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE QUIRK. SO AS WE. TURNED TO. CHIU SUMMER CHIU. YOU'RE HERE ON A. B. TWO ZERO SIX EIGHT. NOW GOT HER THANK YOU NOT QUE WHOA. PLEASE SO YOU'RE FREE TO BEGIN AS WE. GATHER MEMBERS AND THE WAY TO QUORUM BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING A PRESENTATION. TAKE YOU VERY MUCH HAVE MISTER CHAIR TO MEMBERS. AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO START BY A SECOND TO COMEY HE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH THE WHO WHO WAS MY OFFICE. AB TWENTY SIX CA ASK THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC SCHOOL. SHOULD OR COULD HAVE THEIR OWN GAS AND ELECTRIC. ELECTRICITY RATE CATEGORY INSTEAD OF BEING TREATED AS A COMMERCIAL FACILITY. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SCHOOL. BUT AS FOR ALL THE STATE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AND YOU RATE INCREASE. UNLIKE OTHER ENTITIES OF SCHOOL CANNOT EASILY RATES FEES AND TAX TO CUT THE RECOVERED THE INCREASING BECAUSE OF YOU YOU'D INCREASING UTILITY COSTS. SCHOOLS SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT OF UTILITY COSTS ESTATE DO ON BOOKS. AND SUPPLIES IT IS ONE OFF THE TOP FIVE HIGHEST EXPENSE FOR SCHOOL. AS AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I KNOW FIRST HAND THE FINANCIAL STRUGGLE DEAD TO SCHOOL GO THROUGH. AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THE DECK CAN HELP TO DIRECT SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. AND ESPECIALLY OF SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT ARE SEEN LOWER AND ROMAN GREAT. AND WAS TO HIRE YOU UTILITY RATE AND SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LAY ALL TEACHERS. THIS BILL FOLLOWS A SIMILAR CPUC DECISION LAST YEAR. THAT ASK THIS SAN DIEGO ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATION TO LOOK INTO ESTABLISHING A SCHOOL ONLY RATE. I LIKE TO A AND EXPAND THIS CONSIDERATION STATEWIDE. TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT MAKES SENSE TO SUBJECT A DIFFERENT. HOPEFULLY A LOWER RATE FOR SCHOOL SO MORE MONEY CAN BE DIRECTLY SPEND TOWER TO STUDENT. I WAS ME HERE TODAY ARE A SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. AND OF THE FERREIRA FROM HIS SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION. AND NASTY CHAIRS ON THE CALLER PHONE NO SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION. BUT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MET EACH OTHER SUSPEND ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION IT'S. AT THE PLEASURE TO BE HERE IT'S MAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WHICH ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT ELEAZAR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE CONTENDING WITH. WE ARE NOW. CELEBRATING THIS YEAR WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA REACHING ITS TARGET WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FUNDING LEVELS. WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE I WASN'T SUFFICIENT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR EXPENDITURES NOW. OR ONE OF THOSE EXPENDITURES THE HAS BEEN INCREASING IS THE COST OF ENERGY AND IT OUT IT AFFECTS. IT AFFECTS SCHOOLS DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE STATE BUT. WE'VE SEEN INCENDIO GO COUNTY WHERE SCHOOLS HAVE REALLY BEEN. IMPACTED BY RATE SHOCK. THESE INCREASES THAT THEY'VE BEEN RECEIVING YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH WERE NOT RECEIVING ANY MORE HAVE LARGELY BEEN CONSUMED. BY ENERGY EXPENDITURE INCREASES SO. THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY AFFECTS STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSROOM AND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE ABLE TO DEVOTE TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. I I DID WANT TO ADDRESS ONE ISSUE. THAT REALLY. UNDERLIES WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S ADDRESSED IN THE IN THE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE SUPPORT ALL OF THEM BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF. PARCEL TAXES. THE THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE REALLY OVER OVER ENERGY IS. BUILT ON THE NOTION THAT LOCAL EDUCATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES CAN RAISE REVENUE AS NEEDED WHEN THERE ARE INCREASES IN OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT JUST ISN'T THE CASE WITH RESPECT TO. EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THE ANALYSIS MAKES REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN SEEK PARCEL TAXES. BUT. I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOME CONTACTS TO SAY THAT THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE FOR MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FEWER THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS THE PARCEL TAX. THOUGH AND YOU REALLY SEE THOSE FRANKLY IN THE WEALTHIER PARTS OF THE STATE. PARCEL TAXES ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF ALL OF THE EDUCATION FUNDING IN THE STATE SO JUST FOR CONTEXT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T. EXHAUSTED OUR OUR LOCAL OPTIONS IT'S THAT WE REALLY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN SO I WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. AND SO I'M GONNA ASK OF SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. ESTABLISHED CORE. HOLDEN. HERE PATTERSON HERE. BURKE. GEN. CUNNINGHAM. RODRIGUEZ THEIR. GALLAGHER. CRISTINA GARCIA. EDUARDO GARCIA. MAYES. MURATSUCHI. QUIRK. REYES. SANTIAGO. TING. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON BUT CHAIRMAN HOLDEN IN MEMBERS I'M ANA FERREIRA ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION WHERE AN ORGANIZATION MADE UP OF SCHOOL A PUBLIC SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT DOES INCLUDE CHARTERS. AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE. WHEN SUPPORT OF TWENTY SIXTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUE NATURE AND ENERGY LOAD. OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ELECTRICITY RATES ARE OFTEN AS YOU'VE HEARD ONE OF THE TOP THREE MOST COSTLY ITEMS. IN A SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISCRETIONARY BUDGET. SCHOOL DISTRICTS SPEND ABOUT AS MUCH ON ELECTRICITY. AS THEY DO ON BOOKS AND SUPPLIES. WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS SINCE THE MTA POINTING OUT THAT RATES ARE INCREASING FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. BUT THE UNIQUENESS FOR SCHOOLS IS THAT IN THE FACE OF THESE INCREASES. HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND FUND THEY CANNOT CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY DO BUSINESS? IN RESPONSE EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS IS NOT LIKE MANUFACTURING WIDGETS. WE CANNOT. THEY CAN'T BE MOVED TO THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT. IN THE FACE OF AN INCREASE IN RATES. TWENTY SIX STATES SIMPLY ASKS THAT THE PC TAKE ITS OWN RECOMMENDATION. A STUDY WHETHER SCHOOL RATE WOULD MAKE SENSE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AND ELEAZAR CONSISTENT ENCYCLICAL ENERGY USAGE AND VULNERABILITY TO REACT TO THESE RATES. SO THAT ELEAZAR MAY REVIVE. MAY RECEIVE A SPECIAL RATE THAT IS LOWER AND MOVES THEM FROM THEIR CURRENT COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL RATE CLASS. WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE GIVEN THEIR MISSION TO EDUCATE K. TWELVE STUDENTS. REPUBLICAN MUNICIPAL UTILITY RATES ARE NOT INCLUDED BECAUSE THE RATES ARE TRADITIONALLY LOWER. AND BECAUSE THE BILL IS SIMPLY TAKING A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE PC MADE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND APPLYING IT TO THE OTHER ELECTRICAL UTILITIES THAT IT REGULATES. FINALLY. IT IS CORRECT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE CHARTER OR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE UNABLE TO RAISE TAXES AND FEES AS FINANCING MENTION. IT. BUT SO THEY MUST ADDRESS THESE RATES IN THE GENERAL FUND. THIS IS THE SAME GENERAL FUND THAT PAYS TEACHERS FUNDS BOOKS AND OTHER TOOLS FOR LEARNING. IT IS ALSO WHY WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY ONE WEBER. I'M WHICH IS GOING TO BE HEARD NEXT WEEK. MENTIONED AND OTHER LEGISLATION IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WOULD BETTER ALLOW SCHOOLS TO WEIGH IN ON I OWE YOU RATES THAT MAY IMPACT THEM. WITH REGARD TO PARCEL TAXES WHICH MUST BE PUT TO THE VOTERS SCHOOLS ARE NO WAY ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT KIND OF OR HOW MUCH OF A RATE INCREASE. THEY MIGHT RECEIVE AND TIME TO PUT A VOTER. CAMPAIGN TOGETHER OR ASK DISTRICT VOTERS TO VOTE FOR FUNDS TO PAY FOR FUTURE RATE INCREASES. POTENTIAL ELECTRICITY RATE INCREASES. SO IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE AYE ON TWENTY SIXTY A IT ALLOWS CPUC TO EXAMINING CRAFT A RATE. THAT WOULD TAKE THE UNIQUE NATURE AND CONSISTENT USAGE. PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEM ASSEMBLY ABSORB THESE RATES BY CUTTING AND OTHER AREAS THAT AFFECT OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT WILL NOW TURN TO THE AUDIENCE AND WILL RECEIVE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL NAME. EARLY EDITION. AND JUSTICE YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRISTEN BROWN OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS HERE IN SUPPORT URGING AYE VOTE THANK YOU. FAIR BY JUST OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS ALSO IN SUPPORT. A MARINE ON BECAUSE URKEL CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. IN TO DEAL WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL SHOT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE WERE PREVIOUSLY AND OPPOSE POSITION BUT BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE AND ESTABLISH LANGUAGE. I WILL BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION DID WANT TO MAKE ONE NOTE IF. THE CHAIR WOULD INDULGE FOR A MOMENT. MANUFACTURERS DO NOT HAVE AN EASY TIME DEALING WITH HIGH ENERGY PRICES EITHER. SO WE ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE SCHOOLS IN THE POSITION THAT THERE AND. I WE DON'T SIMPLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PASS ON TERMS OF HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE RUN A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE MARKET SO. OTHER STATES OTHER COUNTRIES WE COMPETE AGAINST THEM THEIR ENERGY COSTS ARE LOWER THAT MAKES US LESS COMPETITIVE SO WE DO. EMPATHIZE CREEK DEAL WITH THE SCHOOLS AND LOOK FOR TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS FOR EVERYBODY. MR CHAIRMAN PERSONAL ANY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF PACIFICORP WERE A SMALL UTILITY THAT SERVES THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE SETS DEL NORTON' ASKEW COUNTY. WE DO HAVE A FORMAL OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL WE WILL REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS WE JUST NOTE THAT WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. AND FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKARIAN PERSONAL LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM. PROVIDING A DISCOUNT POTENTIALLY FOR SCHOOLS. COULD IMPACT OTHER REPAIRS AND. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THEM DESPITE COSTS THANK YOU. SO I GUESS WE BLENDED INTO THE OF THE. PROPOSAL THAT WHILE THERE. A IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. HEARING NONE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES THAT WOULD LIKE TO FIRST TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. PERRANCE SEEING NONE. OF WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SOME ARRESTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHU THIS IS A FEASIBILITY STUDY RIGHT. SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THEM CAN MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS BUT TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO DO IT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS UP SO WE CAN FIND THOSE WAYS TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY STAYS IN OUR SCHOOLS WITH THE TEACHERS. AND TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. SEARCH TO WAIT. APPRECIATE YOUR BEST THERE WE GO WE NEED A. SO IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. WE DO APPRECIATE THE BILL AS WELL WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ALSO TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO.

WE HAVE YOU HERE FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE. YES THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AB TWENTY THIRTY ONE REQUIRES THAT I CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO ENSURE THAT ADEQUATE MARKETING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ARE UNDERTAKEN TO ENABLE SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT CUSTOMERS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS EXISTING LAW PERMITS SURCHARGES ON BILLS OF ELECTRICITY AND GAS CUSTOMERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF FUNDING INVESTOR. OWNED UTILITY ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO HELP CALIFORNIA BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND COLLECTIVELY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SUCH REPAIR FUNDED ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS FOR MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT RETROFITS AND PRACTICES BY MEANS OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES REBATES EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. EXPENDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR IS CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING STATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS. HOWEVER SMALL BUSINESSES DESPITE INTO EXISTING THAT DESPITE PAIN INTO EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THREE ELECTRICITY AND GAS RATES PARTICIPATE MINIMALLY IN EXISTING ENERGY CONSERVATION PRACTICES. OFTEN DUE TO THE LACK OF AWARENESS AND LIMITED RESOURCES. STUDIES AND EXISTING I OWE YOU. ENERGY EFFICIENCY PLAN IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR GREATER SMALL BUSINESSES PER PARTICIPATION AND ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY THIRTY ONE SIX TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ENSURING THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE A GREATER AWARENESS. PUB AND ACCESS TO EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PRACTICES AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. DAY YEAH HE'S THE IT WE RAN A BIGGER AYE WITH ME TO TESTIFY AND THE. IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE A REPRESENTED FROM THE CALIFORNIA GREEN BUSINESS NETWORK. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL PIMENTEL. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA GREEN BUSINESS NETWORK. THE NETWORK IS A NONPROFIT THAT OVERSEES TWENTY SEVEN A GREEN BUSINESS PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I AM WAS CREATE AN STATURE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES TO PREVENT OUR. WILL REDUCE POLLUTION CONSERVE RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ALL WHILE SAVING BUSINESSES MONEY. AT THE PROGRAM TARGETS EQUIVALENT UNDERSERVED ON CAP SECTOR OF SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES. WHICH CONTRIBUTE CALIFORNIA'S POOR AIR QUALITY AND AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOS A BUT WE'RE ALSO HERE TO BE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AT THERE WERE SEVERAL STATE FUNDED CLEAN ENERGY IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. UP PETE FOR USING COMMERCIAL TAXES AND OR FEES ON UTILITY BILLS. IT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR MICRO BUSINESSES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE INCENTIVES AND REBATES. I THIS IS BECAUSE OFTEN BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE YOU DON'T KNOW A OF THE INCENTIVES THAT EXIST OR EXISTING OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON MEDIUM TO LARGE BUSINESSES. I AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE IS A VERY STRONG IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT P. YOU SEE WITH THE HELP OF GOBIZ I TO ENSURE THAT ADEQUATE OUT WHICH IS BEING DONE WITH SMALL BUSINESSES TO WARN BETTER PARTICIPATION. IN EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ITEM. YEAH. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. WE WILL PAUSE FOR SECOND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. A LOOK AT ALL THAT HEARING GOING ON. IS THERE ANYONE WHO IS HERE THAT. IT'S LOOKING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. RIGHT. OKAY WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OR THE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR WHO IS RECEIVING A STANDING OVATION AND ALL. HEARING NONE WE THANK YOU FOR. VERY IMPORTANT BILL OUT REACHING TO THE COMMUNITY IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING SMALL BUSINESSES AND CERTAINLY IT'S A WARNING WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS WOULD BE.

SHARES OF. OKAY IF MR GARCIA YOUR. BECAUSE THE DOCTORS OKAY AND I DON'T. WE GOT THAT. NOT THAT ALL PARTS OF THE BILL. BUT THAT STOP THAT'S FINE I'LL GO. OKAY. AND THEN MISTER BERMAN IS ALSO IN COMMITTEE I MEAN. BUT MISTER BERMAN WELCOME. YEAH I'M. WE APPRECIATE YOU I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY A CHALLENGING AFTERNOON IN TERMS OF MAKING YOUR WAY AROUND TO VARIOUS COMMITTEE DIDN'T YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND. AS THEY ARE. SO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO PRESENT A BIG TWENTY TO SEVENTY EIGHT. AND LET ME JUST PREFACE BY SAYING THAT. NORMALLY IN THIS COMMITTEE. YOU WILL HEAR DOCTOR QUIRK A SPEAK VERY OFTEN. BUT TODAY HAS LARGE IDEA SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK. SO IF IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S QUIET AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT HE'S NOT ENGAGED. I JUST CAN'T TALK THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. WELL MISTER COURT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TALK USED CLEARLY STILL VERY FAST BECAUSE. I WAS JUST PRESENTING FOR HIM. AND. GEO COMMITTEE AND I LEFT BEFORE HE DID AND HE GOT HERE BEFORE I DID. SO I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO GET AROUND THIS BUILDING CLEARLY. THINK DETERMINE HOLDEN AND AND. HOLDEN AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY EIGHT PRESERVES THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SELF GENERATION BILL CREDIT. OR REYES BCT PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC COLLEGES TO GENERATE RENEWABLE ENERGY IN ONE LOCATION AND HAVE ACCREDITED AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY USE THAT AND IN ANOTHER LOCATION. FOR EXAMPLE A COUNTY COULD LOCATE SOLAR PANELS OVER THE PARKING LOT A PARK BUT YOU SEE ELECTRICITY FOR A COUNTY JAIL. AND THE CURRENT STATUTE WHICH AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES AT NO COST SHIFTING TO OTHER RATEPAYERS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE INVESTED IN RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS AND RELY ON THE REYES BCT PROGRAM TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS FEASIBLE. RECENTLY THE STATE'S INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE PROPOSED CHANGES TO TIME OF USE PERIODS AND SEASONAL DEFINITIONS AND A PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT CREDITED PER KILOWATT HOUR. TO SOLAR CUSTOMERS LIKE REYES BCT CUSTOMER. THESE CHANGES RENDER MOST REST BCT PROJECT ECONOMICALLY UNDER WATER AND MAKE THE REYES BCT PROGRAM EFFECTIVELY INOPERABLE. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT SIX TO HOLD HARMLESS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT INVESTED IN RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS BASED ON TIME OF USE RATES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. I HAVE WITH ME SUSAN GOBER MILLER WITH THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND OTHER AND OTHER WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. PERCY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU HERE TODAY I'M DOCTOR SUSAN GILBERT MILLER. DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO HOW. WE'VE BEEN AFFECTED. IN TERMS OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SELF GENERATION BILL CREDIT. TRANSFER PROGRAM REDS BCT. WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THIS IS BEEN A REALLY VALUABLE TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO. PUT RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS ON. AVAILABLE LAND. IT'S ALLOWED US TO USE THE TRANSFER BILL CREDITS. TO PAY FOR OTHER GOVERNMENT ELECTRICITY ACCOUNTS THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT SOLAR. AND BY STATUTE AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD REQUIRES THAT THERE BE NO COST SHIFTING TO OTHER UTILITY CUSTOMERS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AUTHORIZED FOR THERE TO BE SIX SO RENEWABLE. PROJECTS CONSTRUCTIONS IN OPERATION OF SIX SOLAR GENERATING SYSTEMS. AND OF THOSE SIX SYSTEMS FIVE OF THEM RELIED ON THE REDS BCT. PROGRAM. AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. OUR FIVE GROWTH BCT PROJECTS WERE PROJECTED. TO RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF OUR ELECTRICITY COSTS OF BY APPROXIMATELY FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS OVER THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR LIFE TERM OF THOSE PROJECTS. THE PROJECTS WERE FINANCED USING CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY BONDS WHICH IS THAT MEANS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE ABLE TO FINANCE THESE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. RECENTLY. THE STATE'S UTILITIES HAVE. AS YOU'VE HEARD PROPOSED TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE TIME OF USE PERIODS AND THE SEASONAL DEFINITIONS FOR THE REST OF THE FEW KEY PROJECTS. THE FOR THEIR TARIFFS. THESE CHANGES WILL SEVERELY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OUR REYES BCT PROJECTS. ALTHOUGH THE UTILITY TARIFFS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE VARIABLE. AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE DEVELOPING THE SOLAR PROJECTS THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS KIND A CHANGE IN TERMS OF TIME OF USE AND FOR THE SEASON DEFINITION. WITH. UNFORESEEABLE. SO EVEN WITH TEN YEARS WORTH OF GRANDFATHERING AND OF THE TIME OF USE AND THE SEASONS. WHICH I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE CPUC. THE COUNTIES COST SAVINGS ON THE REDS BCT PROJECTS WILL SHRINK SO SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THE PROJECTED SAVINGS THAT WE HAD. DETERMINED WILL IT BASICALLY EVAPORATE. THIS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE COUNTY'S BUDGET AND THEREFORE AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY EIGHT. THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. WILL SIMPLY FREEZE THE TIME OF USE PERIODS AND THE SEASONAL DEFINITIONS FOR REDS BCT PROJECTS. THIS ESSENTIALLY WILL DO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF HARM TO OURS AND THE REDS BCT PROJECTS OF OTHERS. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THESE PROJECTS. AND CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF THE STATE'S VERY CRITICAL EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO GREEN OUR ELECTRIC GRID. SUPPORT GREEN JOBS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR ME JUST PAUSE FOR A SECOND. SANTIAGO YOU'RE CATCHING MY EYE WAS THERE. ONE OF THE MOVE APPROPRIATE. YOU CAN MOVE ANALYSIS LIKE. WHO THE BILL? YEAH. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DELETING HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL OUR MEMBERS OTHER SOLAR DEVELOPERS THAT GO UP TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOP THESE PROJECTS. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YEAR OTHER OTHERS HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL. ARE THERE ANY. WITNESSES OR INDIVIDUALS OF LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. PERFECT TO. YOU'RE GOOD. FIND UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. AND WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. ON THAT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE. ARTICULATED AND THEIR DESIRE TO RETAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BILL CREDITS FOR BEHIND THE METER SOLAR SYSTEMS ON THE TREATMENT THAT'S PROVIDED IN THIS BILL IS ON PRECEDENT IT. IT ESSENTIALLY WOULD LOCK IN FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TIME OF USE PERIODS THAT WERE IN A FACT AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOTH FOR ANY. EXISTING REDS BCT CUSTOMER AND FOR ANY NEW RECIPE CITY CUSTOMER. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT'S DIFFERENT I'M FROM THE T. O. U. PERIODS THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED VERY SOON. I'M PRIOR TO JANUARY TWENTY ONE AT JANUARY ONE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE PEAK PERIOD YOU OFFER PGD CUSTOMERS WAS TWELVE SIX PM. THAT WAS THE HIGHEST VALUE PERIOD FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY. THAT PERIOD IS CHANGING IT WILL GO TO SOMETIME BETWEEN FOUR AND NINE PM THAT WILL BE THE NEW PEAK. AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD MUCH TESTIMONY ABOUT THE SHIFTING PEAK IN THE RESULT OF NOT LOAD ON THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER A REYES BCT CUSTOMER UNDER THIS BILL WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PREMIUM VALUE FOR PRODUCTION OCCURRING BETWEEN TWELVE AND SIX PM. UP UNTIL TWENTY FORTY FOUR. I NOT ONLY AGAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS BUT A NEW CUSTOMER THAT SIGNS UP IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW WOULD STILL GET. THE DEAL YOU PERIOD THAT WAS IN EFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MAKES SENSE ON IT IS A SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFT IT DOES NOT SATISFY THE STANDARD OF INDIFFERENCE THAT IS ARTICULATED IN THE ANALYSIS. AN EXISTING LAW THEREFORE WE THINK THAT IT DOES NOT STAND UP TO ANY SCRUTINY. IN ADDITION AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE GENERATION RATE INCREASE BY THREE PERCENT PER YEAR FOR EVER IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION RATES ARE NECESSARILY GOING GIVEN THE CHANGING TIME OF USE PERIODS. IT SETS UP A VERY SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDY STREAM INTO THE FUTURE AND IT IS IN TOTAL CONTRAST TO THE EVOLUTION OF NET METERING POLICY. AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING PRACTICE WITH WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF NET METERING. AND IT REALLY I'M HANDCUFFS THE P. YOU SEE FROM BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP REASONABLE RATE DESIGN THAT BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF THE CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD BE BENEFITING FROM THIS PROGRAM. AND THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS. WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THE PROGRAM? THANK YOU. OKAY AT CHERRY MEMBERS THE GOING UP AND IT'S WITHIN YOUR GAS ELECTRIC. WHAT THINK THE STAFF AT THE CONFERENCE OF ANALYSIS SOMEWHERE HERE TO POSE AB TWO TWO SEVEN EIGHT? AYE WE BELIEVE THIS IS LEGISLATIVE RIGHT MAKING AND AS A CONSIDER A LOT OF FACTORS A PARTICULAR SYSTEM BENEFITS. GENERATION COSTS AND IMPACTS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS A PARTICULAR RESIDENTS. AS WAS MENTIONED AT TIME OF USE HAS BEEN A LONG ANTICIPATED POLICY ON THE LEGISLATURE CPC AND OTHERLOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENDORSED ON THIS NEW THAT PEAK PERIOD THAT WE'VE SHIPPED TO. AND THE BILL AS WAS MENTIONED ALSO REVERTS BACK TO PREVIOUS TIME FRAME WITH THE FULL DEFINITION WHICH IS WHOLLY COUNTERINTUITIVE TO. NOT ONLY. ENCOURAGING ENERGY CONSERVATION BUT ALSO A ONE EIGHTY HAVE FLED FROM WHAT LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED. AND WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER THIS RATE STRUCTURE OF THE PRICES DO NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL VALUE OF ENERGY PRODUCED OR CONSUMED AND ULTIMATELY THIS WOULD HAVE. AT A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. ANOTHER. ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT IT IGNORES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHIFTING TO UP COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND AND WHICH IS INCREASINGLY SERVING IN OUR AYE YOU CUSTOMERS NOT TO MENTION THAT THESE PROVIDERS ARE NOT MANDATED TO. TO TO GO TO TIME OF USE. BUT IT'S NOT FAIR FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS AND WILL BE WHO WILL BE STUCK PAYING THE BILL. WHILE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CHOOSING TO DEPART BUT POINTING TO. LOCK IN RATES FOR THE REMAINING IT UP FACILITIES. I'M SO WE JUST WANT TO ALSO MENTION THAT. YOU KNOW WERE ALL IN FAVOR FOR. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC IS PROUD TO BE AT FORTY FIVE PERCENT RENEWABLE SOURCES. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEES ELEMENTS BUT. WOULD HAVE TO SAY RESPECTFULLY THAT COULD LEAD TO SPELLS UNNECESSARY AND UNFAIR FOR ALL CUSTOMERS TO RESPECTFULLY QUESTION A VOTE. THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS RYAN PARINI WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT SUBMITTING OUR LETTER. EARLIER HOWEVER WE'VE HAD. A CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THEY HAVE EXPRESSED THOSE CONCERNS. THEY'RE ALIGNED WITH WHAT HAS ALREADY PREVIOUSLY BEEN STATED WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE MET. AUTHOR IS TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS IT MAKES IT A BIT MORE PALATABLE ALTHOUGH WE DO ULTIMATELY BELIEVE IT WOULD RESULT AKASHI HAVE. THOSE BORING THE BILL. IRRELEVANT SO WITH THAT WE ARE REMAIN CONCERNED TAKE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRED VENA FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY OUT WE APOLOGIZE AS WELL FOR GETTING EARLY AND LETTER IN LATE HOWEVER WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE IT IS UNNECESSARY AND IMPOSES A CAUTIOUS ON NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS THIS IS BEEN VETTED AT THE P. YOU SEE AND WE SHOULD ABIDE BY WHAT THE P. YOU SEE HAS ORDERED IN THIS. SETTLEMENT WITH FEET A LOCAL COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND OUT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE NO BOAT THINK YOU. THERE ARE NO OTHERS OF LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. HEARING NONE. MISTER BERMAN WE. KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN A A VERY IMPORTANT BILL NOT ONLY FOR. THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU REPRESENT BUT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT CERTAINLY WE'RE LOOKING TO BENEFIT BY IT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. AS WAS STATED AT THE P. YOU SEE THAT HAVE A HEARING ON THIS MATTER AND HAS SORT OF LOOK AT IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. SORT OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMITTEE IS OF NOT TO DO LEGISLATIVE RATE PAYING. A RED CENT RATE SETTING. AND ALSO THE ISSUE OF COST SHIFTING. HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THAT YOU YOU RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND WE. IN THE SPIRIT OF WHICH THIS AMENDMENT WAS MADE WAS TO. FOR ALL INTENDED PURPOSES GIVE YOU. ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE. I WILL SAY THAT IT'S A HELL MERRY. OF FOR THE RECORD BUT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AND TO AT LEAST. HAVE YOU AND YOUR SPONSORS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF PASSION. ANNIE STRATEGIES ARE IDEAS THAT WOULD NOT CAUSE THERE TO BE. RATE SHIFTING. WE WILL LOOK TO THE P. UC TO OPERATE WITHIN ITS. STATED GUIDELINES SHOULD GET TO THE PC AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO. DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS RATE SHIFTING. AND IF IT IS THAT WOULD BE OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY NOT. SUPPORT THIS. EFFORT. BUT HAVING SAID THAT AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS AND. THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU REPRESENT. IT'S THE. CHEERS. RECOMMENDATION FOR A DO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE JUST ONE. SAY THANK YOU BUT YOU'RE HOLDEN FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE TIME THAT YOU PUT IN. OF BEEN VERY EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL FOR ME. AND APPRECIATE THE CHANCE AT A HELL MARRY AGAIN. THE EXISTING REQUIRES THAT THE CPC ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO COST SHIFTING. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT. AND AND APPRECIATE. AND. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. IF YOU. A REPUBLIC.

AND WE KNOW THAT STUCK IN COMMITTEE AND SO. AMERICA'S HERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS YOU CAN SEE YOU ARE A TWO WITNESSES ARE. READY TO GO I WILL LET READ MY STATEMENT FIRST AS THE TO AND UP TO THE BILL. IN THE. INTERESTS OF UP MISS AT YOUR CURRY POSSIBLY WALKING IN A TOWARDS THE TALENT. THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION A SECOND DOWN. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TO AWAIT WHICH WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET. IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE GOLD AN ENERGY NEEDS BY INSURING THE YOUS AND PROCUREMENT OF SPECIFIC RENEWABLE. RESOURCES. FIRST ELECTED THANK ARE GOING AUTHOR MISS AT YOUR CURRY FOR PARTNERING ON THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT. AB THIRTY TO THE LANDMARK CLIMATE BILL PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX DIRECTED THE STATE TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS. TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND TO CONSIDER OVERALL SOCIAL BENEFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN AIR QUALITY. DIVERSIFICATION OF ENERGY SOURCES AND OTHER BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. A PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND STEEN FURTHER DIRECTED THE STATE TO ENSURE MISSION REDUCTIONS WERE HAPPENING IN OVER BURDEN COMMUNITIES. THIS MEANS WE MUST DO MORE THAN JUST SET STATEWIDE STANDARDS. BUT DO SO IN A NOR WANTS WAY TO INSURE CHO BENEFITS ARE REALIZED IN REGIONS OF OUR STATE. THAT ARE IN MOST NEED OF THOSE BENEFITS. AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN FINALLY START MAKING THOSE PROMISES A REALITY. FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY THIS BILL IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST ENERGY IT IS ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND JOB CREATION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF GOOD PAINT JOBS ANY PART OF THE STATE THAT SUFFERS FROM STUBBORNLY HIGH. UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE ADDRESSING SOME OF OUR GREATEST AIR QUALITY AND ECOLOGICAL THREATS AT THE SALTON SEA. TODAY THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN A PILL IS SIXTEEN PERCENT. THE SECOND HIGHEST IN THE STATE NEXT TO COLUSA COUNTY WHICH IS TWENTY PERCENT. TO PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE A FEW YEARS AGO IMPAIR COUNTY HAD THE HIGHEST ON THE POINT COUNTY. IN THE NATION AT OVER TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. ALMOST A THIRD OF THE POPULATION. LONG TERM GILT THERMAL ENERGY IS SIGNIFICANT AS A PRODUCES NEARLY FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT INTERMITTENT RESOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND. WITH THE RETIREMENT OF NUCLEAR RESOURCES SUCH IS DOUBLE CANYON AND SEVERAL FREE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A DISTINCT OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE THOSE BASELOAD RESOURCES WITH GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. SALTON SEA KNOWN PUPIL MORE RESOURCE AREA HAS UP TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF UNTAPPED POTENTIAL. I RESOURCES UNFORTUNATELY THIS AREA REMAINS UNDER DEVELOPED MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO MONETIZE THIS RENEWABLE ENERGY. POTENTIAL. THIS IS WHY AB TWENTY TOY IS IMPORTANT TO US AS IT ENJOYS A STRONG SUPPORT OF THE IMPAIR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND NUMEROUS DEVELOPERS INCLUDING OR MET CAL ENERGY ENERGY SOURCE CONTROLLED THAT MORE RESOURCES AND YOU'LL GEN COMPANY TO NAME A FEW. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO SEEK A BALANCED APPROACH TO RENEWABLE ENERGY MINDFUL OF HOW MUCH CARBON EACH SECTOR ADMITS. FRANKLY WE CAN DO MORE AS A STATE TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES INCLUDING WATERSHEDS TO ALLOW FOR THE BALANCED APPROACH TO RENEWABLES INCLUDING GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. APPRECIATE AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE ANALYSIS DEDICATED TO THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS WHICH CURRENTLY. IS UNDERWAY AT THE PC. I SUPPORT THAT PROCESS IN FACT I VOTED FOR THAT BILL THE CREATED. THE REASON WE NEED THIS BILL IS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T TRUST THE I RP. BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROVIDE MARK UNCERTAINTY TO DEVELOPERS NOW SO THAT THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE. TO BUT PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY TO DEVELOPERS SAID THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO RISK VALUABLE INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS TO BUILD THESE FACILITIES NOW. UNFORTUNATELY APPEAL COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE THE LUXURY. AND TIME TO WAIT FOR THE I RP. THE STATE HAS KICK STARTED ITS INVESTMENT IN MITIGATION PROJECTS NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. NOT ONLY FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE SEA BUT THE ENTIRE STATE. THE BILL WILL HELP MOVE THE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES FORWARD. FOR THE NEXT YEAR NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT NOW. IN CLOSING LET'S NOT FORGET MEMBERS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS UNCONDITIONALLY LIABLE FOR MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF THE QUANTIFICATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE LARGEST RURAL TO URBAN WATER TRANSFER IN THE UNITED STATES. AGREEMENT IS CAUSING THE SALTON SEA TO COLLAPSE EXPOSING HUNDREDS OF MILES OF SHORELINE DID THAT ARE STRONG WINDS. DEVELOPING THESE FACILITIES WILL NOT ONLY HELP COVER SOME OF THE EXPOS PLAYA BUT ALSO GENERATE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO HELP THE STATE MEET. LEGAL OBLIGATION TO THIS REGION. ON EL READ MRS AT YOUR CURRY STATEMENT. WELL FOR THE RECORD. AB TWENTY TO AVOID WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY COURSE. CORRECTION FOR THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. AS WE MOVE TO INCREASE YOUR NOBLE PROCUREMENT TOWARDS FIFTY PERCENT AND BEYOND. ARE RENEWABLES ARE OUT OF BALANCE AND LESS DIVERSE. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF WIND AND ESPECIALLY SOLAR WHICH ARE VALUABLE BUT INTERMITTENT RESOURCES. THE SAME TIME BIO ENERGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES HAVE NOT GROWN. MANY FACILITIES HAVE CLOSED AND MANY MORE WILL COME OFF LINE WITHOUT BEING WE COUNTRY THAT. IN THE COMING YEARS. BEFORE WE REACH THE FIFTY PERCENT ARE PS MARK WE ARE NOT WE ARE ON TRACK TO LOSE VALUABLE RESOURCES. THE STATE HAS SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN PRESERVING. THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE NOT ONLY TO SMOOTH GREAT IMBALANCES BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO STATE. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LARGE GEOTHERMAL FACILITY THAT HAS PROVIDED HIGH WAGE JOBS FOR DECADES MY CONSTITUENTS CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THOSE JOBS. WE ALSO CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE GREAT BENEFITS THE GUY JUST PROVIDE TO CALIFORNIA. THE RELIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT KEEPS THE LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHYING. THAT FACILITY ALSO TREATS WASTEWATER AND HAS HELPED CLEAN UP WILD RIVERS LIKE THE RUSSIAN RIVER. RIVERS THAT FACE INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION FROM WILDFIRES AND LANDSLIDES. IN A NEW ERA OF EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. CALIFORNIA IS AN AGRICULTURAL STATE AND I HAVE A WANT FORM MYSELF WITH MOUNDS OF AGRICULTURE WASTE WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT AGRICULTURE WASTE INTO BIOENERGY. SHOULD BE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO AVOID THE SORT OF OPEN BURNS WE SAW LAST YEAR THAT FURTHER POLLUTED OUR AIR. AND WATER AFTER THE WILDFIRES. WE FACE THE FUTURE OF RAMPANT WILD FIRES THAT DEVASTATE OUR ENVIRONMENT. WATER SUPPLY CLIMATE GOALS AIR QUALITY AND ULTIMATELY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS ISSUE MANY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BIO ENERGY IS ONE OF THE BEST AND USES FOR THE FORCE WASTE TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE. AGAINST WILDFIRES. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES AND ARE FORCED DUE TO DROUGHT AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATIONS. THESE TREES ARE ESSENTIALLY HEALING FOR FUTURE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WILDFIRES CANCEL OUT GAINES WE MAKE THROUGH OUR AGGRESSIVE G. H. G. AND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE REDUCTION GOALS. WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY AND IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO REVERSE THIS WILDFIRE SAGA AND THE STATE'S BIO ENERGY RESOURCES MUST BE AN ASPECT OF THAT PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. I KNOW THAT FOLKS HAVE RAISED ISSUES ABOUT THE COST OF DEAL THERMAL AND BIO ENERGY. BUT VALUING THESE RESOURCES ON A COST PER MEGAWATT BASES IGNORES THE HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES THAT THESE RESOURCES BRING TO THE STATE. WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ONE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES MY DISTRICT IS IN THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE MUST ACT NOW. SIMILAR BUT MORE EXPENSIVE BILL AB NINE TWENTY PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WITH OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. TODAY. FOR GARCIA AND I NEED YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN ON THIS BILL AB TWENTY TWO ALL EIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND DIE WITH ME IS WITH RICH GORDON AND MISTER SEE SEATED THE AS A TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE. STILL WORKING ON A JOKE TO REFLECT ON. MISTER GORDON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN CHAIR HOLDEN AND AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS RICH GORDON. AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE TODAY TO SEEK YOUR SUPPORT PLATFORM OF FOR A BEAT TO TO AWAIT. ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCERS. AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. AND THE FORCED INDUSTRY AND CONSERVATIONISTS. BIOMASS GEOTHERMAL AND BIOGAS. A RELIABLE RENEWABLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES. SO THEY CAN SERVE AS BASELOAD AND BALANCING SOURCES OF ENERGY. IT'S GOOD FOR THE GRID. IF THE ECONOMY. GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE STATE SHOULD NOT PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IN AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DETAILS TO THAT MUST BE FURTHER NEGOTIATED. AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU. THAT OUR COALITION IS MORE THAN WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE JOINT AUTHORS. THIS COMMITTEE. OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSURE A POSITIVE OUTCOME. I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE FOCUSES ON ENERGY RELATED ISSUES. BUT I WOULD BE REMISS AS PRESIDENT OF FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. IF I DIDN'T MAKE A COMMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. AND THE CONSIDERATION BROADER POLICY GOALS. ARE FOREST'S ARE SIMPLY OVERGROWN. WHEN THE EUROPEANS ARRIVED IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY FORTY TREES TO AN ACRE. TODAY THEY ARE A MORE THAT HUNDREDS OF TREES FOR EVERY ACRE IN OUR FOREST. HIS OVER GROWTH LEAST TO TREE MORTALITY. INCREASED FUEL FOR DEVASTATING FIRES. FORCED HEALTH WILL REQUIRE THINNING OUR FORESTS. SERIAL LEFT FROM THINNING. IS BIOMASS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THIS MATERIAL CAN BE BURNED ON SITE. RELEASING CARBON AND OTHER NOXIOUS GASES. THAT MATERIAL CAN ALSO BE LEFT IN THE FOREST. WHERE'D HE REMAINS AS FUEL FOR FUTURE FIRES. A THIRD CHOICE. ETERNITY AND ENERGY. THE CONVERSATION THIS YEAR AND THIS CAPITAL ABOUT WILDFIRES FORCED HEALTH. CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. IT HAVE TO INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BIOMASS. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT CONVERSATION BY MOVING THIS BILL. WHICH DEALS WITH RELIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY. BY MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO DO THAT TODAY BY VOTING AYE ON AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT. THANK YOU. BUT MR CHAIRMAN PROCESS OR THE OTHER BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO. HERE PROUD SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE MOVES TO HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES HAVING A DIVERSE SET OF RESOURCES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. AT THIS MOMENT SO LIBERAL TAPE PHOTOVOLTAIC IS THE LOWEST COST RESOURCES ACQUIRING FASTBALL GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES MAY BE ABLE TO BETTER MATCH. CALIFORNIA'S THAT THE MAN. MEN SIMPLY ADDING MORE PEAVEY. AB TWENTY TWO ZERO EIGHT. PROPERLY PLACES A NEW REQUIREMENTS ON LOAD SERVING ENTITIES BASICALLY ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ACHIEVE OVER NOBLE GOALS. THE ADDED FOCUS ON THE SALTON SEA IS A STRONG COMPONENT OF THIS BILL. THE AREA HAS SOME OF THE BEST YOU'LL FEWER RESOURCES AS A STATED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND THE VELLUM THERE WILL HELP MITIGATE THE OF OUR MENTAL IMPACTS OF THE RECEDING SAID CITY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GEYSERS. AS WAS STATED BY ASSEMBLY. WOMAN. GEIGER CURRY'S COMMENTS HAS HIGH WAGE JOBS AND THEY ALSO ARE IN STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE BUILDING TRADES THAT IS OFTEN BUILD THEIR PROJECTS WITH PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL AS OTHERS IN THE SALTON SEA AND BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS WORTHWHILE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO ACHIEVE DIVERSITY. AND ACTUALLY HAVE THAT NEED A A BASE LOW DEMAND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WILL NOW HEAR FROM OF THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. OF THE SPELL. CRAP DAY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JULIE MALINOWSKI FOLLOW BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE. CBA IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION STATES WOULD WASTE POWER PRODUCERS WHO ARE TODAY TAKING MATERIAL AT THE FIELDS OF THE FOREST AND DIVERTING IT OUT A LANDFILLS. TODAY BECAUSE THE STATE IS MANDATING THAT THAT HAPPENS SO AS STATED BY OUR WITNESSES YOU COULD HAVE THAT MATERIAL TO SIT THERE AND DO NOTHING OR YOU CAN DO THE BETTER. THE BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL CHOICES MOVING THAT OUT OF THERE IN A CONTROLLED COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY BIOMASS BR IS IS VALUABLE BEYOND THE RENEWABLE ELECTRONS AND THIS BILL IS MAKING THAT POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND FOR THE REMAINING SPEAKERS NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. I ANSWER OUT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MADIGAN A BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF LEXICAL WORKERS THAT. CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL.

BARBER LA VACHE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN FOR AGRICULTURE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY LANDOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL. KELLY BOY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION BROAD COALITION OF AG INTERESTS FORCED INTERESTS ENERGY PROVIDERS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER SHARON MEMBERS TRICIA GERINGER WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. JULIA ELEVEN BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT MORE THAN SEVENTY PUBLIC AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES WERE HE TO CONVERT ORGANIC WASTE TO ENERGY IN STRONG SUPPORT. HI JEFFREY HARMON REPRESENTING HONEY LIKE POWER DOES REVIEW POWER AND TRACY BIOMASS HOLDINGS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. DAMN PROMPTLY NO WITH DUNNIGAN HILLS HAULING SELLING CORTINA HOLING SHELLING OR TWO LARGE ALMOND HOLDERS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

STRONGLY SUPPORT TAKING. DENNIS ALBION AB HAVE THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL BOCA DORO WEST COAST ADVISERS ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. BUT DRIVE SOME PRESENT OF THE WESTERN CULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY TRINA COLORS AND PROCESSORS IN THE STATE AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. KAREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBINSON WAS SHOT YOUR AUNTS WE ON BEHALF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON RESOLVING THOSE CONCERNS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS UNFUNNY ORTEGA REPRESENTING THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHAT OUT YOU AND SALAS ON BEHALF OF CONTROLLED THEIR MORE RESOURCE IS ONE OF SEVERAL DEVELOPERS ITEMS HOMES HE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE BILL? GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH AT THAT PROCESS BAXTER IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON BEHALF OF THEM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND JUST TO REMIND AND REITERATE THAT THIS. BILL IS MORE THAN JUST ENERGY FOR US IT IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DEVELOP A RESOURCE. THAT CAN LEAD TO HUNDREDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHOSE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES PERSISTENTLY HIGH. THINKING. FUTURE MEMBERS CHRIS MCKAY ON BEHALF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM. ANY WITNESSES OR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THE BILL THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF TURN. WE'RE HERE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO OO EIGHT I'M WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING EXISTING BIOMASS AND GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES IN THE STATE GO OFF LINE. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO PAY AND UNNECESSARY PREMIUM TO GET IN THE FUTURE WHAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY ALREADY BEEN RECEIVING. AND WE THINK THIS BILL COMES FROM A PLACE OF GOOD INTENTION BUT THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE MECHANICS. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL WOULD UNNECESSARILY RAISE THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE RP ES PROGRAM. FOR RETAIL CONSUMERS AND WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE OWNERS OF EXISTING ASSETS THAT QUALIFY UNDER THE DEFINITIONS OF THIS BILL. TO EXERCISE MARKET POWER BY RAISING THEIR PRICES. DON THAT'S OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN I'M WE ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED TO ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE COMPLIANCE BASED ON TOTAL PROCUREMENT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEGAWATT HOURS. THE BILL SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE OF FLEXIBILITY IN GENERATION AND WANTING TO INCORPORATE GENERATION THAT CAN RAMP UP OR DOWN TO MEET SYSTEM LOAD BUT COMPLIANCE IS MEASURED BASED ON TOTAL PROCUREMENT AND SO ALL OF THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEGOTIATED TO MEET THE STANDARDS AND THIS BILL. WOULD BE DESIGNED TO FORCE THESE FACILITIES TO GENERATE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MEGAWATT HOURS NOT TO OPERATE AS LOAD FOLLOWING FACILITIES. NOT TO TRY TO INTEGRATE OTHER RESOURCES IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA BEHIND THE BILL. MOREOVER THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE RESOURCES RAISES THE POTENTIAL THAT FIRST OF ALL ON EXISTING SMALL HYDRO ELECTRIC GENERATION MIGHT QUALIFY AS A RENEWABLE FLEXIBLE GENERATION RESOURCE ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS HERE. AND IN ADDITION I AM I WOULD EXPECT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COMPLIANCE OTHER THAN THE SALTON SEA PORTION TO COME FROM OUT OF STATE RESOURCES THAT ALREADY PROVIDE. SOME OF THEIR OUTPUT CALIFORNIA LOAD SERVING ENTITIES AND WOULD BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PREMIUM PRICING. IT WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THIS BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA HAS OVER NINE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF EXISTING BIOMASS AND THEY ALREADY TRIED TO MARKET MUCH OF THAT TO CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD BE WARY ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARILY GOING TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING BASE OF RESOURCES IN THE STATE ON THAT THE SPONSORS ARE HOPING. ON TO PROTECT ON THE BILL AND THEN FINALLY WHILE WE SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL IN THE SALTON SEA. THE MECHANISM FOR ACCOMPLISHING THAT THROUGH THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ON WORKABLE IT WOULD REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY DIFFERENT BUYERS. TO OBTAIN FRACTIONAL SHARES IN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF NEW GENERATING FACILITIES THAT WOULD BE BUILT IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA. WE THINK THAT IT'S UNWORKABLE AS DRAFTED ON AND THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO MAKE THIS WORK IN ADDITION WE THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE VIOLATION AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS. I'M WE THINK THERE'S NOT A NEED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE AND MAYBE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO MAKE THE SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL VISION A REALITY WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. BUT WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL GETS THERE THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME SHANNON ANY I'M WITH A LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION. ONE ECHO EVERYTHING OF THAT MATT FRIEDMAN SAID ABOUT THE BILL I THINK HE HE OCCURRED OUR CONCERNS ARE WHAT AT A COUPLE OF OTHERS. ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW BUT CARVE OUTS IN THE CONTEXT. OF THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD ARE DIFFICULT AND THE MARKET REALLY SHOULD BE THE ONE DICTATING WHICH ENERGY SOURCES ARE PROCURED IN WHICH. WHICH AREN'T SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE WERE DEFINITELY CONCERNED ABOUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT PRO KEEP FORCING THE PROCUREMENT AFFIRMED RESOURCES FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO CHEER THERMAL AND BIOMASS. AND RIGHT NOW THE GRID NEEDS FLEXIBLE RESOURCES MORE THAN IT NEEDS FROM RESOURCES SO TO FORCE A TECHNOLOGY INTO THE GRID. FOR VARIOUS REASONS OTHER THAN THAT THAT THERE NEEDED TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT. MORE BROADLY I THINK THIS THIS BILL AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS RAISES THE ISSUE PROCUREMENT MORE GENERALLY RIGHT NOW RENEWABLES PROCUREMENT IN THE STATE HAS SLOWED DOWN. ALMOST TO A FULL STOP WHEN IT COMES TO THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THE CCA'S ARE PROCURING SOME. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND I KNOW THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY FOR THESE DEVELOPERS. I WOULD GO ON TO SAY THAT THIS THOUGH THAT WHAT WE NEED IS MARKET CERTAINTY FOR ALL RENEWABLE DEVELOPERS. THE PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW TO MEET THE STATE'S OUR PS AND CLIMATE GOALS. IT WE NEED ABOUT TEN GIGAWATTS OF NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY LONG TERM CONTRACTS BUCKET ONE CONTRACTS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT'S PROCUREMENT THAT NEEDS TO START NOW AND SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN A CONVERSATION CERTAINLY WITH THE AUTHOR IN AND OUT WITH THE CHAIR ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO. BEGIN OF A SUSTAINED PROCUREMENT PATHWAY FOR ALL RENEWABLE RESOURCES BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO START THE PROCUREMENT NOW. AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD CONVERSATION TO START. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M DANIELLE MALES ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CAUCUS. WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND THAT WE DO SUPPORT A. AT GOOD DIVERSITY IN THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND CALIFORNIA'S ACHIEVEMENT OF ITS GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AM UNFORTUNATELY REVIEW THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A TARGET OUT. GOT CARVE OUT THAT AT PREAMPS THE STATEWIDE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS WHICH ALSO IDENTIFIED. ELEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF WIND. CURED AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A RESULT OF THE. FADING AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKINGWITH THE AUTHORS FURTHER IN AND TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN. SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS EVERY NOBLE GOALS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REPAIR INTERESTS THINKING. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. BUT WE THINK THIS TYPE OF PROCUREMENT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE IRP PROCESS WHICH AGAIN LOOKS AT BOTH GHG GOALS COST. AND. BALANCING THE GREAT WE THINK THAT'S THE MORE APPROPRIATE PRICE PLACE FOR THIS THANK YOU. YEAH AND IF YOU COULD OF NAME. FILIATION AND. S. NOT ANYMORE AND ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK CAPTAIN MY NAME'S YET OF US ISN'T HE I'M BEHALF A CHALFANT RUNS JUST ALLIANCE AND ALSO THE ASIA PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTS NETWORKING OPPOSE IN THE POSITION WE SUBMITTED A LETTER WITH THE CURTAINS. TRANSMIT ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA. MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE A BILL AND PRINT WE UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE SOME AMENDMENTS FORTHCOMING IF THAT'S THE CASE WILL. REEVALUATE OUR POSITION AND OUR POSITION DOES NOT REFLECT. THE VIEW OF ONE OF OUR MEMBERS THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT WE'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUSLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TWENTY HUNTER WHO BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND. OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR LORDS JIMENEZ HERE WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC AND FORMALLY. CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE BEST ASSEMBLY MEMBER HEARING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MISTER RODRIGUEZ. AYE BUS. WE SEND YOU A GUEST IN THAT ONE YEAR AND IF. HE'S REALLY AN AWESOME BOSS HE EARLIER YOU RELEASED SORRY CAN'T. SO. HERE WAS TENURE GAS ELECTRIC IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THE POOR TO WORKING WITH THAT THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOKERS IN THE OTHER CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORED A STAFF. ARE CONCERNED HAS BEEN COST IF THIS BILL AS AMENDED AS PROPOSED COMMITTEE ANALYSIS LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THE JURY MEMBERS RIGHT FOR ANYWAY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE A BOTH AUTHORS. BUT WOULD ALIGN OUR OPPOSITION WITH THAT THAT IS ALREADY BEEN STATED REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY THERE'S A MOTION ON THIS ITEM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT KNOW TOO THAT FIRST OF ALL. STERN GARCIA WE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR. CONTINUED AND AN AUG SO AGO CURRIES. FOCUSED ON ON THIS IMPORTANT AREA YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD LOOK TO CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS A. BALLOTS A DIVERSIFIED. RESOURCE PLAN AND SO CERTAINLY. THESE ARE AREAS BIOMASS AND GEOTHERMAL THAT WEEK KATIC NOR. HAVING SAID THAT. IN YOUR OPENING. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE OPENING YOURSELF WERE AS I HAVE YOUR CURRY BUT I THINK YOU. EXCEPT THAT THE. AMENDMENTS THE WORD DO EXCEPT THE A PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE OKAY AND IF I COULD I'M GONNA. JUST READ WHAT THOSE REPRESENTED TERMS OF THE AREAS THAT THEY ADDRESS. ON PAGE SIX WE WOULD STRIKE LINES SIX. TWENTY FOUR. THAT'S THE FIRST SECOND IS AT PAGE TEN REPLACE LINES ONE TO TWENTY THREE. WEST FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS IN THEIR LIST OUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THE STRIKEOUTS. THEN AND PAGE FIFTEEN REPLACE LINES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND THEN AGAIN THERE'S A LIST OF. VARIETY OF ITEMS THAT WE. HAVE MADE THE CHANGES TO SO THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE TAKEN. AT THE NEXT COMMITTEE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. AND SO WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT. LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. AS FOR THE SO THAT WAS FOR CLARIFICATION. SOMERS HERE. WELL OUR FIRST OF ALL. I I'D I DO WANNA GO OUT. SAY THAT I AM SYMPATHETIC WITH WHAT WERE WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE. AND I GUESS THE PART THAT IS ME. MOST PERSUASIVE. IS THAT. THE ABSENCE OF OF REALLY AN ABILITY. OUT TO HAVE A CAPACITY TO TAKE THE THE THE FOREST. I HAD ITS PULL A FEW FUEL AND THE IT IT'S WAITING TO EXPLODE. HAVING SAID THAT I AM GOING TO RESERVE A VOTE NOW. BECAUSE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT COME OUT OF THE NEXT GO AROUND SO WE'RE. APPARENTLY. IN NATURAL RESOURCES. ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THAT BASICALLY DON'T TELL US WHAT ANY OF THESE NUMBERS ARE. WHICH MEANS IT'S SORT OF AN OPEN AN OPEN BOOK HERE. AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TO HAVE A A LOOK AT WHAT THE FINAL. PRODUCT IS GOING TO BE IF IT HAS. SIGNIFICANT THE. RIGHT SPEECH STRESS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I I LIKE I SAID BEFORE. I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER. A A PRICE TAG FOR DOING WHAT THIS IS PROPOSING TO DO. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THE SCOPE SIZE AND THE. THE CONTRIBUTION TO TO SOME OF THE RATE AT THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO I THAT UP I'M GONNA I'M GONNA LAY OFF ON THIS. I'M I'M SYMPATHETIC I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DETAILS. SO IF I DON'T SEE IT UNTIL THE FLORA JUST GONNA RESERVE FINAL. JUDGEMENT UNTIL I SEE AN ENTIRE PACKAGE WITH ALL OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT OF THAT. INFORMATION THAT THANK YOU. RESEARCH. THANK YOU MUCH SHARE IDEA. YEAH I ALSO I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M VOTING ON HERE. I JUST RECEIVE THE ANALYSIS YESTERDAY I. HAVEN'T HAD THEIR. CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BILL AND TO. AYE I'M PREPARED TO GIVE A COURTESY VOTE PETA. MY INCLINATION IS TO LAY OFF AT THIS. ERIC. VARIOUS. THANK YOU. ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE. TO HAVE THIS. I KNOW THAT ARE IT. IT DOES POSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BECAUSE WE'RE NOW HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE TRUCKS COMING IN. AND ALL THE DIRTY ENERGY GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THAT. STE WANTED TO MAKE IT. THAT THAT IS MIGHT MY BIG ISSUE HERE. BUT. SO I SIT SHARE THE VICE CHAIRS THAT CONCERNED. ALTHOUGH I'LL BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY JUST THEM ABOUT I'M I'M BUT MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME EXPLANATION OF WHY WE DECIDED TO TAKE THESE A MEN'S TODAY WHY THE PERCENTAGES AREN'T THERE BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE ROLE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO. MOVE THIS KIND OF POLICY AND IT SEEMS LIKE NOW WE'RE JUST DIVERTING THIS AND SAYING HEY WE'RE GONNA GIVE US NATURAL RESOURCES. WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE BUT TO KILLEEN YOU KNOW IS THERE ANY AND ALL THAT. MISS AGAR CURRY IS NOT HERE DOWN BUT I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. OF THIS IS THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT TO US AND SO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO MAKE SURE THIS IS MOVING ALONG BUT I AND ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO. AYE TO HAVE ITS SAY. I I THINK IT'S. NO I COULD. CERTAINLY WOULD LOOK TO MISTER DARCY OF TO HAVE A COMMENT BUT I THINK IT'S THIS IS THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION AT THIS POINT THEY'VE ACCEPTED IT WAS NOT THEIR INTENT TO HAVE IT. WITHOUT PERCENTAGES WE WERE CONCERNED AT THIS STAGE OF HAVING ANY NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD BE LOCKED INTO AND WE WERE STILL WORKING ON. SOME IDEAS THAT WOULD BE MORE OF A. GLOBAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS. WHERE THIS MIGHT FIT AND APPROPRIATELY SO WHERE ESSENTIALLY MOVING IT FORWARD RECOGNIZING THAT THERE STILL WORK AND PROGRESS ON SOME OF THIS THAT WE NEED TO? CUT A CIRCLE BACK AROUND AT SOME POINT AND AN IRON OUT THE DETAILS AND LOCKING AND TO THE NUMBERS. TODAY. HOW MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND DOING THAT RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT? MR I THINK YOU YOU CHARACTERIZE IT DOWN THE WELL. INODE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T CALL IT HELL MERRY I THINK WHERE I HAVE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. IF IT. THE FACT IS THAT I THINK AT SOME POINT RIGHT THERE WILL BE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGES. AND DEBT I THINK THE WORD AND AND I OFTEN. STILL THE WORD FROM OUR FORMER SENATE PRO TEM. IN IN IT WILL COME BACK WITH THE THE INTENTIONALITY. THAT THAT THE DISCUSSION BRINGS FORWARD TODAY. AND SO I'M YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. WITH CHAIR IN HIS COMMITTEE STAFF OUT THERE IS LIKELY A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE BILL WILL COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AGAIN IF IN FACT. I IT IS PREPARED. TO BE PRESENTED WITH THE PERCENTAGES AS YOU KNOW US SOME MEMBER MAYES. AS IT RELATES TO THE JEWELER MACUM POINT OF THIS AND I I THINK THE THE BIOMASS. YOU KNOW COALITION I WOULD AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CERTAINTY. WIND THIS UP POLICY COMES TO THE FINISH LINE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IF WE ARE WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE FIFTY PERCENT ARE PS OR IF THAT GETS. RAMPED UP THAT THERE IS CERTAINTY THAT THESE. FLEXIBLE BY RENEWABLE ENERGIES WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL NOT ENERGY PROCUREMENT OF. THE STATE. WAS ON THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS THEN THAT'S GREAT I'M OF THE BILL. WAS ALREADY MOOT BUT WE APPRECIATE. IF THIS DOESN'T. WE WILL. THERE NO OTHER QUESTIONS UP. IT'S BURKE. THAT YOU KNOW AS THAT MEMBER FROM INGLEWOOD I'M PROBABLY THE LEAST LIKELY SUPPORTER OF BIOMASS BUT I'M INCREDIBLY HUGE SUPPORTER OF BIOMASS I THINK THAT THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS THAT COME WITH THAT AND AS FAR AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE I THINK. BIOMASS IS A GREAT ACTUALLY SOLUTION TO A LOT OF OUR AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS WILDFIRES ARE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LARGEST GENERATORS OF CICI SO I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TOTALITY IN AND. ABOUT NOT JUST OUR STATE BUT THE COUNTRY SO. WITH THAT I I'M I'M A CO AUTHOR FUND IT'S PRETTY. SCARCE YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK UP THAT THE COMMITTEE WHETHER BE A COURTESY VOTE OR A SOLID VOTE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ARE. A WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BOMB OPPOSED. THE MEASURE TODAY. AND TO AND KNOW THAT. MS AT YOUR CURRY'S COMMITTED TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO THIS IS DUE PASSED IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND AT THAT POINT THE AUTHOR.
