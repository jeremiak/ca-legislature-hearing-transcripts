I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS- THAT HAVE MADE THE TIME TO TRAVEL EARLY THIS MORNING TO BE HERE TO TESTIFY TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I WANT TO RECOGNIZE- FIRST OF ALL THE TRIBAL AFFILIATIONS THE HOMELANDS OF WHERE WE SIT AT WITH THE ME WHAT NYSSA NON POT WHEN. PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA. THIS IS A JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIR- CRISTINA GARCIA OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND HER MEMBERS FOR PARTNERING WITH US TODAY. LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF MANY IN THIS ROOM WE WERE ABLE TO GET AB THIRTY NINETY NINE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- LAST SESSION. IT ADDRESSES A MAJOR PUBLIC SAFETY EVENT ISSUE. ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS AND NOT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN PARTICULAR- BUT NATIVE AMERICANS- IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THERE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST REPRESENT A GROUP OF MISSING AND MURDERED- PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S OUR NATIVE AMERICAN. SISTERS BROTHERS AND CHILDREN SO BRING IN THIS- FULL CIRCLE TO HIGHLIGHTED NAVIGATED I WAS ONE OF THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ON HERE TODAY. AND WHAT THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE FORMED HERE FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL- HEARING TO RAISE THE ADVOCACY OF WHAT'S TRULY IS HAPPENING IN INDIAN COUNTRY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER REPORTED THAT ABOUT 10% OF THEIR TOTAL ENTRIES FOR THE YEAR. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED. OF THOSE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN THAT GROUP THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF REPORTED MISSING PERSONS WERE AMERICAN INDIANS ALASKA NATIVES NATIVE HAWAIIANS. OR PACIFIC ISLANDERS WHICH WERE ALL GROUP TOGETHER AND THIS IS DSPITE THE FACT THAT THEY MAKE UP THE SMALLEST PORTION OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION. SO THAT SHOULD SENT ALARMING DATA STATISTICS OF WHY IN THAT AREA THEY'RE AT THE HIGHEST SECOND LEVEL THERE WHEN THEY'RE THE LEAST HAVE THE LEAST POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES THERE'S A PROBLEM GOING ON. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE ISSUE ITSELF HAS NOT RECEIVED AND SUSTAINED THE ATTENTION THAT AS IF IT-DESERVES THAT IS WHY AT THE URGING OF ADVOCATES IN THIS ROOM AND IN PARTICULARLY INCLUDING- FROM THE SEMI WHAT TRIBAL GOVERNMENT- THE STUDENTS AND THE YOUNG TRIBAL COUNCIL THIS YEAR TODAY AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM. AS THEY- LOBBY TO INTRODUCED AB THIRTY NINETY NINE THE AVIC IT'S- FOR OUR TRIBAL. WERE FIVE YOUNG STUDENTS YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM SHORTLY. TWO YEARS AGO IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE FIRST HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. WE DISCUSSED A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE AMERICANS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WAS MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. AT THE TIME CALIFORNIA WAS NUMBER SIX. ON THE TOP OF THE TOP TEN LIST OF SATES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER. OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS AND CASES WITHIN THE SAN FRANCISCO. AREA IT WAS IN THE TOP TEN. THAT INFORMATION ALSO CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO WHY AB THIRTY NINETY NINE WAS INTRODUCED. AB THIRTY NINETY NINE REQUIRES THE NEW PROGRAM OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS AMONG OTHER THINGS TO. DEVELOP GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ON POLICING AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS ON TRIBAL LANDS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL PUBLIC LAW EIGHTY THREE TO EIGHTY REFERRED TO AS PUBLIC LOT TO EIGHTY. PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS GEARED TOWARDS TRIBAL CITIZENS ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CONCURRENT CRIMINAL JURISDICTION INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT VICTIMS RIGHTS. AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE AFFORDED TO THEM. SHARE GUIDANCE ON IMPROVING CRIME REPORTING CRIME STATISTICS CRIMINAL PROCEDURES AND INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS FOR PUBLIC INVESTIGATIONS. FACILITATE AND SUPPORT IMPROVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND CONDUCT A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE OF MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. IDENTIFYING BARRIERS TO REPORTING AND ULTIMATELY ISSUING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE THEY WILL COME BACK TO THIS BODY WILL COME BACK TO ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. THIS IS NOT THAT AB THIRTY NINETY NINE WAS APPROVED AND THAT'S THE STOP OF THE WORK NO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WHAT THAT STUDY COMING BACK TO US THAT NOW THAT TWENTY GENERAL WILL BE WELL EQUIPPED TO COMPLETE THAT STUDY. THE LEGISLATURE WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE AND MOVE FORWARD ON PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THAT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WILL PUBLIC SAFETY IS SOMETHING FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. ARE PRESENTERS WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF TRIBAL TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLABORATION AMONG VARIOUS AGENCIES VICTIM AND FAMILY RIGHTS AND OBSTACLES TO REDUCING RATES OF VIOLENCE IN CASE RESOLUTION AND BEST PRACTICES. THIS YEAR WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO SECURE THROUGH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S LEADERSHIP. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY- BUDGET COMMITTEE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOR AB THIRTY NINETY NINE IMPLEMENTATION. AS WE DEVOLVE INTO THE STATISTICS AND HEAR THE STORIES OF FAMILY MEMBERS WE ALSO ARE LEARNING THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN AND BOYS ARE ALSO AMONG THE MISSING. AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY THAT WE ARE INCLUDING BOTH MEN AND BOYS AS WE DISCUSS THESE CASES. HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY ISSUES ISSUES HEAVILY IMPACTING THE CAUSES RESULTS AND RESOLUTION OF VIOLENCE ON TRIBAL LANDS HAVE GONE FAR AND MANY TIMES NOT EVEN INVESTIGATED YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THAT BACKGROUND AS WE PROCEED TODAY IN THE FUTURE. AND NOW IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE THE CHAIR OF THE WOMAN CAUCUS CRISTINA GARCIA WHO HELPED IN CHAMPION THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GOING THROUGH HER BUDGET COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP THESE POLICIES WE JUST TALKED ABOUT- CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU- MR ON THE SHARE OF THOSE THE AMERICAN CAUCUS- WE DON'T REALLY WE'RE HERE TO ASSIST MORE THAN ANYTHING APPLE BY THE VOICE AS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HERE SO JUST EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BE A PARTNER. AND TO LEARN AND FULL TRANSPARENCY THIS ISSUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE RADAR OF THE WOMEN'S CLUBS LONG TIME AGO BUT I HAVE TO MEN AT THE TOP THE WAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND IT WAS UNTIL. ALL OF YOU WITH MISTER RAMOS HAVE DONE THE WORK TO HELP ELEVATE THIS ISSUE AND EDUCATE US AND IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE UP TO YOU TO DO THAT WORK BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND KNOW THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. IS COMMITTED TO BOTH LEARNING AND GROWING AND ADVOCATING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TOP OF AYE THOSE VOICES- ALONG THE WAY AND SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. EXCITED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH MR WRONG WITHIN THE ADVOCATE TO SECURE THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET NO THAT HE'S BEEN- A RELENTLESS ADVOCATE- OUT HERE AND SO YOU HAVE A GREAT REPRESENTATIVE AND HIM AS WELL.

THAT WORKS FOR ALL. IN TWENTY TWENTY S. THAT HE INDICATED THAT MORE THAN TWENTY THREE MS MORE THAN TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MISSING INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS. IN THE COUNTRY ALTHOUGH IN THE CASE THAT NEARLY HALF OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ON SOME RESERVATIONS ARE MURDERED AT A RATE TEN TIMES HIGHER. THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE NONE OF US SHOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORIES THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE HOW MY SISTER MY MOM MY AUNT. HAS DISAPPEARED HAS BEEN INJURED WITH THE REALITIES THAT MANY IN OUR NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES HAVE THESE PERSONAL STORIES. TO TELL. LIVE AT THIS FROM US. CALIFORNIA SO TO MORE THAN SEVEN. THE IN THE TO PEOPLE. BUT THERE'S NO RELIABLE. DATA ON EXACTLY HOW MANY MISSING NATIVE WOMEN THERE CURRENTLY ARE. WE HAVE VARIOUS STUDIES OUT THERE BUT THE NUMBERS. ARE INCOMPLETE AND THAT DATA IS INCOMPLETE. RELIABLE ACCURATE DATA IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF THE PROBLEM. BUT TO. SEIZE INDIVIDUALIZING THE PLIGHT OF THE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. ONCE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION COLLABORATION FEATURES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCURATE CREASE THE CHANCES THAT CASES ARE. CAN BE RESOLVED AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT COLLABORATION IS AND THAT WE ARE THERE AS PARTNERS LISTENING. AND WORKING AND RESPECTING OUR NATIVE TRIBES ALONG THE WAY.

WELCOME TO BOTH MISS HENDRICK IN THIS MODULE WE MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SQUAREPOINT ACT NOT VIRGINIA HEDRICK SHOWING ON MY WILL MATCH UP NOT PELUK LAW. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS VIRGINIA HEDRICK. I COME FROM THE VILLAGE OF STRIKE ON ON THE KLAMATH RIVER REMEMBER THE YUROK TRIBE. AND SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM FOR URBAN INDIAN HEALTH. HAS BEEN MORE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE LIVING IN AN URBAN SETTING. INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND NOW SACRAMENTO. WHERE I RAISED FIVE CHILDREN. THREE BOYS AND TWO GIRLS TWO OF WHICH COME TO MY HOME THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES OF LIVING IN BOTH THE RURAL AREA. GROWING UP WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. AND NOW LIVING HERE IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THE COOLEY IS A POLICY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. BASED AND SUPPORTING OUR URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST CITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE TEN. WE HAVE SIX. OF CLINICS INCLUDING THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DENTAL. AND WE ALSO INCLUDE TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES AN EIGHTY BED FACILITY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND A SIXTEEN BED ALL MAIL FACILITY. AT IN. MANTECA CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS COUNTS FOR CALIFORNIA INCLUDE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT REPRESENTS POPULATION RESIDE IN THE GREAT STATE OF WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY TEN. 90% OF THOSE AMERICAN INDIANS WERE IDENTIFIED AND LIVING AND CALIFORNIA'S URBAN SETTINGS. THE ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN COUNTRY IS NOT LIMITED TO ONLY RESERVATION LAND IN FACT THE ENTIRE STATE IS INDIGENOUS TERRITORY. NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE STANDING AND TRIBAL TERRITORY I APPRECIATE THE LAND OF KNOWLEDGE MEANT THIS MORNING RAMOS IN AN APPRECIATING THAT EVEN HERE IN THE CAPITAL CITY WE ARE ON UNCEDED TERRITORY. SPEAKING OF DATA I WANT APPRECIATE THE MANY STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED THAT SHOW THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION THAT BRINGS US HERE THIS MORNING. I ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE AS AN INDIGENOUS PERSON BUT ALSO LIVES IN THIS WESTERN WORLD. THE WESTERN WORLD TELLS US THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW NUMBERS WE HAVE TO SHOW DATA. TO SHOW THAT IT'S A PROBLEM. TO ADVOCATE FOR FUNDING BUT AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ONE WOMAN. ONE SISTER ONE MAN ONE GRANDMOTHER IS TOO MANY. THE RELATIVES WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME SPOKE OF I WALK CHIEF JUSTICE. NOT ONE LOSS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF US AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. ONE OF MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS MOTHER WENT MISSING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. HER NAME WAS ANDRE A CHECK WHITE. SHE HAS NOT LIVED HER LIFE IN LINE AND HAVE CHILDREN. AND HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE CHILDREN WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER PRESENT OUR ENTIRE LIVES. WE KNEW HER MOTHER WAS MISSING. EVERY PLACE WE TRAVEL TO PLAY BASKETBALL AND VOLLEYBALL AND R. THREE SEASONS OF SPORTS. WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR HER MOTHER. THAT'S JUST ONE STORY THAT IMPACTS THAT COMMUNITY MORE WOMEN HAVE GONE MISSING FROM THAT VALLEY. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE THOUSANDS BUT ONE IS TOO MANY. TO THE POINT OF DATA CALIFORNIA SUFFERS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF RACIAL MISS CLASSIFICATION THAT MEANS AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WE ARE OFTEN IDENTIFIED BY ANOTHER RACE. AND WE HAVE A HISPANIC SURNAME WE MAY BE MISIDENTIFIED WHICH STEMS FROM A LONG HORRIFIC HISTORY RELATED TO THE MISSION IS ATION OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE PHENOTYPICALLY APPEAR WHITE WE WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS WHITE. IF WE APPEAR MARC MULTIRACIAL WE WILL BE CATEGORIZED IN A MULTI RACE CATEGORY AND THEREFORE ERASED FROM PRESENT DATA. WE ARE QUITE LITERALLY BORN INDIAN AND DYING WHITE. THE ISSUE OF MURDERED MISSING NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS ONE THAT IS SERIOUSLY UNDERCOUNTED. SO WE THINK THE SITUATION IS GRAVE TODAY IMAGINE THE MANY LIVES WHO ARE NOT IN THE DATA CHARTS OR NOT REPRESENTED THERE. FOR THE REASONS THAT I JUST SHARED. I WANT APPRECIATION THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO JOIN TODAY I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME FROM THE PANEL BECAUSE I'M SO HONORED TODAY TO BE SITTING NEXT TO MY COLLEAGUES. ABRE MCGILL WHO DOES THIS HARD WORK ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMUNITY. OUR ORGANIZATION IS HOME TO A STATEWIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MMI W. NETWORK CALLED THE RED WOMAN RISING PROJECT AND I'LL SEE THE REST OF MY TIME TO MISS MCGILL. WE ARE THANK YOU MY NAME'S APRIL MCGILL- I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE- OF THIS TERRITORY. AND THE LIVES THAT WERE TAKEN AND MURDERED MISSING FROM THIS AREA- I AM VERY HUMBLE TODAY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. FOR THE RED WOMAN RISING PROJECT. THE RED WOMAN RISING PROJECT STARTED FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT WAS REALLY TO BRING ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH IN OUR URBAN AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THE COOLEY HAS WORKED REALLY HARD TO CREATE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. A NETWORK THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITHIN OUR NETWORK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LOCALLY HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WELL I'M WE'RE IN SACRAMENTO BUT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE I LIVE. I'M A RESIDENT OF SAN FRANCISCO A TRIBAL PERSON AND URBAN NATIVE AND I WORK A LOT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY SAN FRANCISCO HAS HAD A LOT OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST. IN CALIFORNIA. THE WORK THAT I DO IS VERY PERSONAL. WE HAVE LOST OUR SISTERS HERE THAT WERE IN OUR COMMUNITY DUE TO VIOLENCE. UGH. WE MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIMS AND NOT THOSE SURVIVORS VOICES ARE HEARD AND THAT THEIR STORIES ARE TOLD THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS CREATE DIGITAL STORIES FOR OUR SURVIVORS WE OFFER THAT AS A TEACHING TOOL IT'S ONE THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AS NATIVE PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT WERE OLD TRADITIONAL PEOPLE THAT WE TELL OUR STORIES THAT'S HOW WE LEARNED THAT'S HOW WE PASSED ON TRADITION. AND THAT'S HOW WE TEACH OUR YOUNG WOMEN TO BE SAFE. SO WE PROVIDE ACCESS TO OUR TRADITIONAL HEALERS AS WELL WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF OUR WOMEN CANNOT JUST GO TO A CLINIC AND GET. OF PROFESSIONAL HELP THEY WANT TO SEE A TRADITIONAL PERSON SOMEBODY THAT LOOKS LIKE THEM THAT CAN PROVIDE CEREMONY THAT CAN GIVE THEM THE HEALING THAT THAT THEY NEED. SO COOLEY HAS WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR ALLIES THROUGHOUT SAN FRANCISCO THE WORK THAT I DO IN SAN FRANCISCO IS REALLY WITHIN. OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IN THE CITY AND COUNTY FOLKS THERE. WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE AN MMI W. RESOLUTION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO MAKE MAY FIFTH. MMI W. AWARENESS DAY. THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF OUR SISTER JESSICA ALBA JESSICA ALL WAS MURDERED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SHE WAS MISIDENTIFIED SHE WAS NOT. IDENTIFIED AS BEING NATIVE THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT VIRGINIA SHARED EARLIER ABOUT OUR WOMEN. SO WE DECIDED THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SAN FRANCISCO SO WE CREATED AN AMERICAN INDIAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. TO MEET REGULARLY AND TALK ABOUT IDENTIFYING OUR NATIVE WOMEN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. IN URBAN COMMUNITY WE LOOK- LIGHT WE LOOK DARK WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY- WE DON'T JUST FIT INTO ONE STEREO TYPE. AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- LOOK AT. OTHER POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE NATIVE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH US AND PARTNER WITH US. WE ALSO OF HAVE MET WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ABOUT THE JESSICA ALL THIS CASE. BECAUSE SHE WAS MISIDENTIFIED AND HER CASE WAS NOT HANDLED CORRECTLY BUT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BOUTIN WAS WILLING TO HEAR OUR STORY AND TO HEAR FROM HER MOTHER AND HER FAMILY. ABOUT HER CASE AND SO THAT RIGHT THERE OPENS UP A DOOR FOR AMERICAN INDIAN. FAMILIES WHO WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES TO BUILD THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHIN OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. OF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS RECEIVING TRAINING FROM OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EXPERTS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TRAIN. AROUND CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROTOCOLS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. ONE EXAMPLE I WANT TO SHARE IT WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN SAN DIEGO I WAS ADVOCATING FOR AND MURDER NATIVE SISTER WHO I DID NOT KNOW BUT WAS MURDERED AND SAN DIEGO. HER FAMILY WAS ORIGINALLY FROM MONTANA AND SHE WAS CHAYANNE AND- WE WENT TO THE POLICE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO GET INFORMATION ON HER AUTOPSY WHICH WE WERE. NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY OF THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE AND SING FOR HER. MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAD A GOING HOME SAW. AND PRAY FOR HER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO AS ADVOCATES. THAT'S NOT IN OUR JOB DESCRIPTION BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO AS TRADITIONAL PROTOCOLS. BUT IT'S THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AUTOPSIES THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE BILL THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NETWORK. AND BE A VOICE FOR THE SURVIVORS. THESE PROTOCOLS ARE IMPORTANT. TO HAVE IN PLACE. MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DRESS THE HISTORICAL TRAUMA THAT'S HAPPENED FOR A CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THROUGH THE GOLD RUSH. THEIR HEADS ARE WOMEN WERE TRAFFICKED. ARE YOUNG GIRLS ARE TRAFFICKED. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THIS IS HAPPENED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITHIN EVEN THE MISSION SYSTEM IN SAN FRANCISCO I LIVE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT. NOT FAR FROM ONE OF THOSE. CHURCHES THAT WAS THERE AND I KNOW THERE ARE RELATIVES THAT ARE BURIED THERE. THIS WORK IS VERY PERSONAL. JESSICA DIED IN APRIL ON APRIL SIXTH TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WAS MY BIRTHDAY. FOUR MONTHS LATER I LOST MY KNEES TO A DROWNING AND DON'T MARK COUNTY DOWN OUR COUNTY HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MMI W. CASES. AND HER MURDER HER DEATH WAS. IDENTIFIED AS A DROWNING WHICH WE KNOW THAT WAS NOT TRUE. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK WITH OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING OUR MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE AND TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR SURVIVORS AND THE FAMILIES- I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING- ON A LEGISLATIVE LEVEL TO CREATE THIS CHANGE. SO I THINK YOU ARE YOUNG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND BRING IT TO LIFE- THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE EVEN DISCUSSING NOW WITH MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND PERSONS I NEED RESERVATIONS AND URBAN COMMUNITIES- ISN'T SOMETHING NEW. WHAT IS NEW IS BUILDING THE ADVOCACY AMONGST THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE. A POSITION AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE KNOW THAT THE INDIAN PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SUFFERED. I'M GREAT AMOUNTS OF TRAUMA THROUGH THE HIS HISTORY. ON THE LEAD TO THE STATE'S STARTING WITH THE SPANISH EXPLORATION TO THE GOLD RUSH TO EVEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY. TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND TREATMENT TOWARDS NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN. IN PARTICULAR HERE WITH- THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WE KNOW THAT THEIR STERILIZATION POLICIES TAKEN OUT UPON OUR WOMEN. WE KNOW THAT DURING THE FIRST SLAVES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE INCLUDING WOMEN DURING THE MISSION PERIOD. AND AN ONGOING THESE ARE ISSUES NOW THAT HAVE. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN INDIAN COUNTRY IN INDIA COMMUNITIES THAT KNOWLEDGE REYES AND RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BUILDING THAT ADVOCACY NO LONGER JUST. BOTTLED IN INDIAN COUNTRY BUT NOW EXPANDING INTO THE WOMAN'S COPPICING GREEN GAINING ALLIES ALONG THE TESTIMONY OF THE HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. TO START TO HEAL AND MOVE PEOPLE FORWARD. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BOB BARKER ASSEMBLY POCKETBOOK- AT THIS TIME DO WE HAVE THE JOY. DELLA ON THE- CARE GO TO COST THIS. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WONDERFUL- I APOLOGIZE FOR MY TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. AUREL JAMES RAMOS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA SELECT COMMITTEE ON AMERICAN AFFAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND WOMEN'S LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION AND THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY ON SUCH A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. MIRJANA TOM DR JULIE PROFIT I AM HUNGRY I'M ALSO KNOWN AS THE PEOPLE OF THE WAX- AS WELL AS AN OWNER TO SEND YOU. I'M A PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF AMERICAN INDIAN STUDIES AT CAL STATE SAN MARCOS AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIAN CULTURE AND SOVEREIGNTY CENTER. WICKS ON THE WALL OF THE CALIFORNIA IN CULTURE AND SOVEREIGNTY CENTER. IS A TREND THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA USED TO SIGN THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT HE GIFTED THAT CAN TO WANNA MODEL DIXIELAND. FROM THE TIME ABANDONED LISTEN YOU INDIANS. ON ONE OF OUR FIERCEST ADVOCATES. I'M IN SUPPORTING I NEED WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THEIR FIGHT FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND TO BE SAFE AND SHE GET THAT THAT TO US. DISPLAY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND GENERATIONS OF CHANGE MAKERS TO WITNESS WHAT THE POWER OF COLLECTIVE ACTION CAN DO AND TO REMIND US THAT WE MUST NEVER REMAIN IDLE. I WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO SERVE AS THE FIRST INDIGENOUS WOMEN ON THE COMMISSION. ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THAT CAPACITY I WILL ADVOCATE FOR NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN WORK TIRES TIRES CLICK. TO SUPPORT THEIR VISIBILITY SAFETY AROUND. NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS HAVE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT SINCE FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. ALONG WITH COLONIZATION CAME THE KIDNAPPING RAPE AND MURDER OF ANY OF THE GIRLS AND WOMEN. THE LONG STANDING PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS IS NOT NEW AND IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST CALIFORNIA INDIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS IS LONG DOCUMENTED BY THE SPANISH MRS MISSION SYSTEM. THE GOLD RUSH. AND THE STATE SANCTIONED DEMOCRATIC DEATH SQUADS. WERE PAID BOUNTIES FOR MASS MURDERS AND ACTS OF GENOCIDE. AS AN ACADEMIC. THIS IS TYPICALLY WHERE I WOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH STATS THAT DIRECTLY RELATE TO MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IN FORT UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE. THIS UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF AB. THREE ZERO NINE NINE. THE HIGH RATES OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS. THE SYSTEMATIC ERASURE AND DEHUMANISATION OF NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS. JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. DUE TO JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. AND JURISDICTIONAL QUESTIONS IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FAMILY TO DETERMINE IF THE TRIBE THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN A PUBLIC A LOT TO A STATE LIKE OURS WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PRIMARY JURISDICTION FOR A MISSING. WOMAN OR GIRL. THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND PLANNING AGENCY IS ALSO. ALBUM CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING OF TRIBAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS OR THE NEARBY SYSTEMS INTENDED TO SUPPORT OUR WOMEN GIRLS IS VERY MUCH AN ISSUE. AND UNDER RESPONSIVENESS FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FAILURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PRIORITIZE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. WANTED DAHLE WOMEN DISAPPEAR THERE IS OFTEN A DELAYED OR NO RESPONSE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. MOST TIMES INVESTIGATION IS STOPPED IF IT IS KNOWN THAT A WOMAN WAS UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE ABUSER. THESE INVESTIGATIONS TEN DOES A SWEEP UNDER THE RUG BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THESE WOMEN AND GIRLS EVEN A WOMAN OUR YOUTH WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUE IS SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER. SOMEONE'S MOTHER SISTER COUSIN DESERVES EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE NOT ONE CHILD EVER WAKES UP AND SAYS HEY WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE A DRUG ADDICT. WE KNOW FROM THE TWENTY TEN TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION REPORT OUR CHILDREN ARE OFTEN THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO AID THEIR MOTHERS AFTER WITNESSING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALTERCATION. AND OUR NATIVE CHILDREN'S. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS RATE ARE TWICE AS HIGH AS SOLDIERS COMING HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. THE LACK OF MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATIONS OF A MOTHER WHO WAS MURDERED IN CRITICAL. IS CRITICAL FOR THE HEALING OF HER CHILDREN FAMILY AND COMMUNITY LEFT BEHIND. THIS IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME AS A CHILD TO HEROIN ADDICTS. MY MOTHER WAS OFTEN VIEWED BY SOCIETY AS A THROWAWAY PERSON. SHE WAS MY MOTHER. AND I LOVE JERRY MONTHLY I WOULD NOT BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU WITHOUT HER. SO WHILE SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US WE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT NO NATIVE WOMAN IS REDUCED TO AN ABSTRACT. ERASED OR TOSSED AWAY. IT SEX TRAFFICKERS AND OTHER VIOLENT PREP PREDATORS TARGET NEED WOMEN AND GIRLS. THE LACK OF TRIBAL NATIONS JURISDICTION OVER NON INDIANS. HOLD WITHIN KNOWLEDGEABLE SEX SEX TRAFFICKERS OFTEN EXPLOIT THIS AND THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE APPREHENDED AND PROSECUTE WE MUST DO BETTER WE CAN DO BETTER WE KNOW THAT THE ROOT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS IS COLONIZATION THERE IS AMPLE RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT. GOING FORWARD WE MUST EMPOWER CALIFORNIA TRIBES TO EMPOWER THE FAMILIES OF THE MISSING AND MURDERED TO RECEIVE THE JUSTICE THAT IS OWED THEM BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE MUST LISTEN TO TRIBAL NATIONS MANY OF WHO HAVE OFFICE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN PROGRAMS LIKE THE LOYAL BAND OF LISTING YOUR INDIANS BIG VALLEY RANCHERIA PALM ABANDONED LISTEN YOU INDIA YUROK TRIBE AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE STRONG HEARTED NEED WOMAN'S COALITION. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE THAN MERELY PROVIDE THEM A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THEY MAYES THEY MUST TAKE DIRECTION FROM THEM AS THEY ARE AND ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF ADDRESSING MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. TO NOT TAKE THIS ACTION IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE MISSING OR MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN RATES. THAT WE HAVE YET TO COMPILE. I ENCOURAGE CENTERING ENGAGEMENT WHICH TRIBAL NATIONS AND THEIR PROGRAMS AND PEOPLE DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WE MUST PRIORITIZE NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. WE MUST COLLECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER WITH TRIBAL NATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACADEMIA. POLICY MAKERS URBAN AND RESERVATION SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FIND WAYS OF PREVENTING MMI W. I WOULD LIKE TO FINALLY UNDERSCORES SOME IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE MUST BE AN EMPHASIS ON MEANINGFUL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION WITH ALL FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. YOU MUST CREATE AN INDIAN UNIT WITHIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OFFICE ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN DEPARTMENT. WITHIN AMERICAN INDIAN UNIT. WE MUST DEVELOP GRANT PROGRAMS WITH TRIBAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PROGRAMS IN TRIBAL COALITIONS TO ADDRESS. UNMET NEEDS SERVICING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE SUCH AS SUBSTANCE ABUSE LIFE COACHING OCCASIONAL TRAINING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EDUCATION. WE MUST DEVELOP A COMMUNITY BASED RESEARCH TASK FORCE IDENTIFYING GAPS AND FAILURES IN ADDRESSING VIOLENCE AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN WE MUST DO THAT ALONG SIDE OF NATIVE. DATA RESEARCHERS AND- SCHOLARS AND COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS. AND AS AN EDUCATOR IT WAS STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE MUST WAIVE COLLEGE TUITION. FOR NATIVE VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE REBUILD THEMSELVES OFTEN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE NOT THE MAIN BREADWINNERS AND ARE OFTEN RETURN TO THEIR ABUSERS IN FEAR GOING HOMELESS OR NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE FOOD AND CLOTHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE NOW. WITH AN EDUCATION AND FLEXIBLE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WOMEN LEAVING ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN MY PERSONAL MOTTO IS. EDUCATION IS THE PATH TO SELF DETERMINATION. WE NEED TO DEVELOP MEANINGFUL ACCESSIBLE SERVICES THAT PROMOTE HEALING THEMSELVES TO THE STATE ABILITY. I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO THE IMPACTS THESE TYPES OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS HAVE. HAD THEY BEEN IN PLACE WHEN I WAS A CHILD PERHAPS MY MOTHER WOULD STILL BE HERE. I THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOR YOUR TIRELESS COMMITMENT TO SERVICING OUR NATIVE PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IN CENTURY ARE AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THIS MOST IMPORTANT AND PIVOTAL LEGISLATION I PROMISE TO DEDICATE MY TIME AND SERVICES IN HONOR OF OUR NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS AND HELP YOU IN ANY CAPACITY THAT WE CAN. SO I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT AB THREE ZERO NINE NINE IS BUT THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THAT MMI W. CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA YOU SHALL LOVE ACT MY HEART IS GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- PROFESSOR- OFTEN I WAS GONNA SAY PROFESSOR DELLA TORY VERY KNOWN EACH OTHER MANY YEARS AND WORKING ON THESE THESE ISSUES AND THE RECURRING MESSAGE THAT WE HEAR IS THAT HEALING TAKES PLACE FROM RIGHT IT ONCE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE WRONGS OF THE PAST AND IT STARTS BACK WITHIN THE COLONIZATION PERIOD WITH THE MISSION SYSTEM AND THEN ULTIMATELY INTO THE GOLD RUSH BUT IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO. ADMIT THOSE WRONGS THEN IN THAT CONVERSATION PERIOD THAT AGAIN- THE TREATMENT TOWARDS CALIFORNIA DID WOMEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SAVERY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT STARTED WITH THE CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE I WANT TO THANK YOU A PROFESSOR FOR BRINGING THOSE ISSUES FORWARD- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE HEAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT- WITH US TODAY IS- WILLIAM F. HAN SO HE'S A SHARER OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY HE'S BEEN THE SHERIFF OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HE HAS ALSO SERVED AS AN INVESTIGATOR AT THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FROM 200-072-2000 THIRTEEN SHARE HAN SO IS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE REDWOOD TEEN CHALLENGE AND A MEMBER OF THE ROTARY CLUB OF SOUTHWEST EUREKA. HE WILL SPEAK ABOUT HISTORICAL CHALLENGES FACING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCING CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL LAW IN INDIAN COUNTRY AND THE BENEFITS RESULTING FROM HIS TIME AS SHERIFF IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY USING CROSS DEPUTIES ATION AGREEMENTS COLLABORATION AND MUTUAL RESPECTFUL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS HE IS MAKING HIS PRESENTATION VIA ZOOM. DO WE HAVE THE SHERIFF WITH US. YES I AM HERE IN HERE TERREL. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY I JUST WANT TO THANK- CULTURE RAMOS AND I'M SURE GARCIA FOR. ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS PANEL IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION- IT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO CONSIDER C. WORK ON AND EVALUATES- AND- AND I JUST ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF OR MY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THAT TRUST IS BUILT OVER TIME. AND IT IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IF WE WANT TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH- WITH GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT IT HAS TO STAND NOW START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING- AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CONSTANT EFFORT TO- TO ALWAYS- MOVE FORWARD AND TO- TO TRY AND MAKE SOME POSITIVE CHANGES AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE'VE DONE HERE COUPLE KIND THAT'S WHAT I THINK. SURE SIR DO WITHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE- OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING HERE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- AND FORCING TRONG- A LAWS ON TRIBAL LAND AS YOU ARE- WELL VERSED ON PUBLIC ONTO EIGHTY BEING THAT CALIFORNIA I ONE OF THE PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY STATES THAT. AND CONGRESS PASSED IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE- PUBLIC OUGHT. TO EIGHTY WHICH ENACTED. ESSENTIALLY GAVE THIS CRIMINAL JURY. ON TRIBE LAND. AND THIS WAS ENACTED WITHOUT REAL ON TRAVEL INTERACTION OR- WITHOUT CONSULTING OR CONSENTING BY THE TRIBES. AND SO CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES THAT- THAT DID GO IN THIS DIRECTION WHICH- WHICH GAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SHERIFF'S. AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE STATE LAW ON TRIBAL LAND- NOW AS YOU KNOW TRIBE STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITYOVER CIVIL AND REGULATORY ISSUES ON ON TRIBAL LAND AND MADE THE TRIBES OF ESTABLISHED. ORDINANCES AND TRIBAL COURTS AS WELL AS TRIBAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TO TRY AND CREATE LONG ORDER. ON ON RESERVATIONS AND RANCHERIAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- BUT JURISDICTIONS STILL COMES INTO QUESTION IS STILL BEING DEBATED BY THE COURTS TODAY- IN RECENT CASE LAW AS OF A MONTH AGO THAT FEDERAL COURTS JUST ESTABLISHED. YOU KNOW THROUGH- COOLEY VERSUS UNITED STATES. THAT TRIBAL POLICE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETAIN NON NATIVES ON TRIBAL LANDS- WHEN IT IN DURING THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION THEY DETERMINE THAT A STATE CRIME HAS. HAS OCCURRED THEY CAN DETAIN AND THEN TURN THAT SERVICE OVER TO THE PROPER AUTHORITY BUT THEY DO HAVE THAT RIGHT BUT IT'S STILL BEING DEBATED- UP TO THAT COURT DECISION THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AND SO THEY STOPPED AND DETAINED. SOMEONE ON TRIBAL LANDS- AND THEY WORKS NATIVE AMERICAN THEY HAD TO LET HIM GO SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE CONTINUES TO BE DEBATED IN COURTS- AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO. ALSO JURISDICTION IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE ON TRIBAL LAND- TRIBAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN GROWING THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW YOU KNOW CRIME IS IT GET ANY BETTER AND- SO TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. OUT OF THE EIGHT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN HUMBLE COUNTY I HAVE- FOR TRIBAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN WITH INJURED MY JURISDICTION AND ONE- IS TRYING TO GET ESTABLISHED RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON THE NEXT YEAR FIVE TROUBLED POLICE DEPARTMENTS. OUT OF THE EIGHT. BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES ON TRIBAL LAND- AND OUT OF THE AIDS I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT ONLY ONE HAS CLASS ACCESS THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM THAT'S THE WAY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN. COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER- AND TALKS ABOUT MISSING PERSONS WANTED PERSONS CRIMINAL HISTORY IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND SO- THAT'S THE ONE THING I WANT TO BRING UP IN THE IN WILL DISCUSS YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN. YOU KNOW MOVE FORWARD BUT- JUST INTERESTING THAT ONLY ONE OUT OF EIGHT HAS THAT. SO AS AS AS- ONE FORTIES OR STAB US IN TROUBLE POLICE DEPARTMENTS YOU KNOW MANY TROUBLED POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE HIRING. CERTIFIED A POLICE OFFICER TO ACTUALLY SAY. ARE CERTIFIED RECRUITS TO TRAVEL OFFICERS THAT HAVE GRADUATED THROUGH POST CERTIFIED POLICE ACADEMIES- AND THAT'S THE CASE HERE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AND MANY OF THESE TRIBES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY GOING AND GETTING DEPUTIES ATION THROUGH THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND THEY'RE GETTING THEIR SPECIAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION WHICH BASICALLY GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY TO- TO DETAIN. AND TO INVESTIGATE FEDERAL CERTAIN FEDERAL CRIMES ON TRIBAL LAND. AND SO THAT'S THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BECOME FEDERAL PEACE OFFICERS AND TRAVEL OFFICERS. SO THEY CAN ENFORCE ORDINANCES ON TRIBAL LAND AS WELL AS CERTAIN FEDERAL LAWS. AND THE PENAL CODE EIGHT THIRTY POINT EIGHT. ACTUALLY GIVES THE AUTHORITY FOR FEDERAL OFFICERS TO DETAIN- ANYONE ON TRIBAL LAND THAT. IS POTENTIALLY VIOLATING A STATE LAW. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TURN THAT DETENTION OVER TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES SO THEY GIVE EXAMPLE THERE IS A VIOLATION OF A TRIBAL WHAT ORDINANCE OR FEDERAL LAW THEY DETAINED THE SUBJECT THE SUBJECT HAS AN ILLEGAL WEAPON ON THEM OR DRUGS ON THEM. AT THAT POINT TIME AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DETAIN THEM AND THEN THEY CALL THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE WILL RESPOND AND TAKE OVER THE INVESTIGATION MUCH LIKE A CITIZENS ARREST. SO MANY OF THEM ARE UTILIZING THAT ASPECT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IT IS WORKING BUT- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES FALL SHORT WITH YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO ALSO HAVE ASKED YOU KNOW THEY CAN ISSUE CITATIONS SO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE ON YOUR REST SO THEY CAN ARREST AND SIMPLY TAKE SOMEONE TO JAIL FOR FEDERAL LAW VIOLATION UNLESS THE TRIBE ESTABLISHES A AB AND A CURSOR RATIONS SYSTEM THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY- SO THEY HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN ARREST ON ON SOME OF THOSE ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST CRIMES THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ON TRIBAL LAND ARE ASSAULTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- DRUGS ALCOHOL THREATS CASES AND THOSE THE STATE KIND OF CRIMES THAT THEY WOULD WE NEED HELP WITH. AND AS WE LOOK AROUND THE STATE WERE SEEN IN A VERY DIFFICULT- STRUGGLE THAT MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS ARE HAVING WITH HIRING AND RETAINING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS IN THIS JOB BECAUSE THE JOB IS VERY DIFFICULT AND THE TASK IS GETTING MORE DIFFICULT EVERY DAY SO TRAVEL PLEASE ONCE THAT ACCORDING AND WANTS TO- TO DO MORE SO WE'VE DONE HERE IN PUBLIC COUNTY SOME SOMEWHAT UNIQUE AND IT'S GROWING THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS WE'VE ESTABLISHED IMHO USE- WITH- WITH THREE THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS BLUE LAKE LAVON AND YUROK AND WHAT THAT IS THE DEPUTIES ATION AGREEMENTS- THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. WHAT I DO IS A TRIBE EMPLOYS A TRIBAL OFFICERS- AND ANYONE THAT'S GONE THROUGH A CERTIFIED BACKGROUND THEY WERE THEN ABLE TO APPLY TO BECOME RESERVE DEPUTY SHERIFF- THROUGH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE I SWEAR THE MINUTES RESERVES I PUT A TRAVEL OFFICER THROUGH A. SIXTEEN WEEK FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM. AFTER THAT THE TRAINING PER. THERE IS. RESERVE SURE FOR THE SURE OFFICE THEY WERE- AND ALSO IT. ON THE U. THAT SORT. THEM AS A DEPUTY SHERIFF AS WELL AS A TRAVEL OFFICER SO. THEORETICALLY A LOT OF A LOT OF TROUBLES OR STEP THREE JURISDICTIONS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ENFORCE TRIBAL LAW. FEDERAL LAW AS WELL AS STATE LAW. AT THAT POINT IN TIME THEY BECOME A PART OF MY TEAM THEY'RE ABLE TO DISPATCH RADIO USED MY CLASS SYSTEM- INTERACTS AND GET. ACCESS TO ALL THE-DATABASES NECESSARY TO. ENFORCE STATE LAW IN TO INVESTIGATE LAW ON TRIBAL LAND. IS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WIDELY SUCCESSFUL AND YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TRY AND GET MORE. ON TRIBAL OFFICERS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND BE A PART OF OUR SYSTEM SO THERE ARE RADIO IF THERE'S A CALL ON TRIBAL LAND AND THERE'S IT IS A TRIBAL OFFICER THAT'S A DEPUTY SHERIFF. HE WILL GO TO THAT FALL ALONG WITH ANOTHER DEPUTY SHERIFF AND HE'LL WRITE THE REPORTS TO THE INVESTIGATION ON MY SYSTEMS AND INSTEAD OF TO THE JUST RETURNS OFFICE FOR PROSECUTION SO AGAIN. HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE- VERY VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO. AND IT'S SO SUCCESSFUL EVEN THE OFFICE ARE BECOME PART OF MY TRAINING. SO FARM TRAINING DEFENSIVE TACTICS THOSE KIND OF THINGS- TRAVEL OFFICE OR PART OF MY STAFF AND- AND THERE UTILIZED- TO TRAIN OTHER DEPUTY SHERIFFS. SO AGAIN TRUST IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO CONTINUOUSLY WORK ON I BELIEVE FACTS YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT- THIRTY NINE I SHOULD BE ADDRESSING IS HOW WEBUILD TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO IT COMES DOWN TO RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW DO WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE NEED WITNESSES ON TRIBAL LAND TO COME FORWARD AND TELL US WHAT THEY KNOW IN ORDER FOR US TO FOLLOW UP. AND TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN INVESTIGATING CRIMES. SO SO I'VE COMMITTED TO AGAIN REGULAR MEETINGS WITH OUR TRAVEL LANCHED WORSENING TRIBAL LEADERSHIP- GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO HAVE THAT AND I THINK THAT IS. ONE OF THE KEYS TO SUCCESS AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ONE THE OTHER KEYS TO SUCCESS IS ALLOWING TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO GAIN CLASS ACCESS. NOW THE KARMIC JUSTICE ESTABLISHED MANY YEARS AGO THAT THE TRIBES DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST ACCESS. RIGHT NOW IT TAKES A LOT OF PROCESS IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. AND SO I YOU KNOW PART OF THIRTY NINE NINE IS TO REALLY I THINK YOU REALIZE HOW WE CAN STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND HOW WE CAN. GET TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ON- YOU KNOW IN THAT CLASS ACCESS AND THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO. ENTER INTO MISSING PERSONS. PROTECTIVE ORDERS OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS FROM THEIR COURT SYSTEM THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE VERY VERY BENEFICIAL- FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE ALSO SHOULD BE ADDRESSING IS. THE WAY IN SORT OF AN ADDRESS HERE IS HOW WE INVESTIGATE HOW WE DOCUMENTS- MISSING MISSING PERSONS. RIGHT NOW WE CHECK A BOX AS FAR AS- WHAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW PERCEIVED RACE IT IS AND- AND RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHY NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST WHAT TRIBAL AFFILIATION AND A HALF. BECAUSE LIKE I'M MISSING A MISSING PERSON CASE WE ARE MANDATED TAKE A MISSING PERSON CASE NO MATTER WHERE THAT PERSON WENT MISSING. AND THEN WE PUSH THAT INVESTIGATION TO A JURISDICTION WHERE THEY WERE LAST SEEN. SO AS EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE'S REPORTED MISSING IN THE COUNTY BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE LAST SEEN IN SACRAMENTO. I SAID SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT'S MISSING PERSONS REPORT WHY DID WE DO THAT WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICE DEPARTMENTS. WHY COULD WE DO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT AND BE ABLE TO FORWARD THAT INFORMATION TO. THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT SO THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF THEIR TRIBAL MEMBER THAT'S MISSING. AND THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A- ADDRESS TO GET A PROCESS WITH THIS- AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW. TRAINING PUBLIC ONTO ANY TRAINING OUR TRAINING ON TROUBLE RESTRAINING ORDERS TRIBAL LAW TRIBAL CULTURE IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED MORE ASSISTANCE WITH. IT IS SOMETHING THAT- AS A PART OF- THE CHAIR OF TRIBAL- THE TRAVEL COULD BE SURE IF THE STATE SERVICE ORGANIZATION WE ARE COMMITTED. AND I CAN SPEAK ON ALL OF THE TEACHERS WHEN WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRY AND DO BETTER AT THE CULTURAL AWARENESS TRAINING AND TRY TO DO BETTER AT LEARNING. YOU KNOW HOW TO INTERACT BETTER WITH WITH OUR TRAVEL COMMUNITIES GOVERNMENTS GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE TO PEOPLE. AND THAT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US. AND AND WE ARE DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO THIS AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I'M HERE FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN- BEFORE BUT- BUT OUR COMMITMENT IS TO WORK TOGETHER OUR COMMITMENT IS TO. GET BETTER AT SOLVING CRIMES. ONE MISSING PERSON IS TOO MANY AND- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO INVESTIGATE. AND TO DOCUMENT EVERY POSSIBLE CASE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THESE. FINE PEOPLE SOLVE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATIONS AND DO WE CAN TO BRING PEOPLE TO JUSTICE AND- BRING TRUST. YOU KNOW TO THE TROUBLE COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TRY AND STOP CRIME AND BRING PEOPLE SOME CLOSURE TO SOME. SERIOUS LONG CASES SO. ANYWAY I'LL CONCLUDE WITH THAT AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND- LOOK. FORWARD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU O YOU SURE HANS. FOR- BRINGING THIS UP SPEED ON. A SOME SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE AREA AS FAR AS CROSS DEPOSITIONS MO YOU BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTING. THE COMPLEXITIES THAT ARE THERE FEDERAL LAW STATE LAW IN TRIBAL LAW. AND LOOKING AT THE- CROSSED IF IT IS AGES AND UTILIZING RESERVE OFFICERS. THAT WOULD GO IN THERE STARTS TO. SHOW THAT THERE COULD BE A SOLUTION AT LEAST FOR THE FEDERAL- AND THE LOCAL COUNTY ASPECT OF IT HOWEVER. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IN YOUR JURISDICTION- PROBABLY SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE REST OF THE STATE OF HOW THEY ACTUALLY IS WORKING. AND BUILT ON MUTUAL RESPECT OF RESPECT FROM THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WORKING TOGETHER ON SOMETHING THAT TRULY IS WORKING ON IT THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND OUR OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IN THIS TOPIC. AND WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE SAFETY OF ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OUR NEXT PRESENTER WILL BE A- THE CHAIRWOMAN FROM HUBBLE MOTEL POMO OF UPPER LAKE- SHERRY TRIP UP- IS A VERY RECOGNIZE INDIAN NATION LOCATED IN UPPER LAKE CALIFORNIA CHAIRWOMAN TRIP WAS ELECTED TO THE TRIBES SEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AS VICE CHAIRPERSON IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND AS CHAIRPERSON- SHE LEADS EFFORTS TO PRESERVE THE TRIBE'S CULTURE SOVEREIGNTY. AND ESTABLISH ECONOMIC SELF RELIANCE CHAIRWOMAN TRIP I WILL SPEAK TO THE KNOWN HISTORICAL TENSIONS BETWEEN TRIBES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE NEED FOR MORE TRAINING AND EDUCATION FOR ALL INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL CITIZENS CHAIRWOMAN TRIPLE ALSO DISCUSSED HER TRIES BEST PRACTICES AND COMMITMENT TO BUILDING AND MAINTAINING MUTUAL RESPECTFUL GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND COLLABORATIVE TRAININGS AND BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE WAY THAT GOES BOTH. BOTH WAYS BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS ON THE TRAVEL SITE AND GOOD NEIGHBORS WITHIN THE COUNTY AND THE CITY JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE THERE WELCOME THE HONORABLE A CHAIRWOMAN SHERRY TRIPLE. GOOD MORNING- AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED I AM THE CHAIR WOMAN AND HAVE BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND WAS THE VICE CHAIR- SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. WHEN OUR YOUNG GOVERNMENT WAS JUST RE ESTABLISHED. WE LIVE IN A VERY RULE ON THAT BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITY THAT IS REPRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN AG WE ARE CURRY- IT IS ISOLATED- WITH MOUNTAIN RANGES. OUR TRIBE HAS RESIDED THERE SINCE TIME IN MEMORIAL AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD A DEEP AND RICH EXPERIENCE IN THE COMMUNITY- BUT IT ALWAYS WASN'T AS POSITIVE AS IT IS TODAY- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE. FOR LEGISLATION LIKE THIS AND OTHERS IN THE PAST- PARTICULARLY AROUND TRAININGS- OF RELATIVE TO TRIBES AND RELATED ISSUES LIKE PL TWO EIGHTY INDIAN CHILD WELFARE. VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL CRIMES AS YOU ALL ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF- AND HAS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER MUCH OF THE LANDS IN CALIFORNIA WERE A NATIVE LANDS AND- THROUGH THE COURSE OF TIME- THROUGH TERMINATION I'LL GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON OUR TRIBE SPECIFICALLY. BUT THOSE PLANS ARE NO LONGER WITHIN TRIBES CONTROL AND THEREFORE- THE EVIDENCE OF OUR EXISTENCE- IS IN THE GROUND AND SO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL AND PRESERVE SOME OF THOSE. ARTIFACTS IT BECOMES AN ISSUE FOR TRIBES BECAUSE IT'S CULTURALLY AND HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US- THAT THOSE ITEMS REMAIN IN THE GROUND AND- CALIFORNIA'S BEAUTIFUL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- A LOT OF PROGRESS HERE BUT- OFTENTIMES THAT ENDS UP BEING- IMPACTFUL TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHEN ARE. THE EVIDENCE OF OUR EXISTENCE IT IS EXPLOITED OR OR TAKEN. TOM START TRIBE OF RESIDES IN LAKE COUNTY CALIFORNIA IT IS A BEAUTIFUL AREA VERY VERY SMALL UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ALSO THE POOREST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA- OUR TRIBE. WAS IMPACTED IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES BY A CALVARY ACTION AGAINST OUR PEOPLE THAT- MURDERED AND MASSACRED MANY OF OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THAT'S THE BLOODY ISLAND MASSACRE. OUR TRIBE WAS FIRST RECOGNIZED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND EVENTUALLY AMASSED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SIX SIXTY ACRES- HISTORICALLY THAT BECAME OUR TRIBAL LANDS- UNFORTUNATELY IN THE EIGHTEEN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. CONGRESS PASSED THE CALIFORNIA RANCHERIA ACT WHICH EFFECTIVELY TERMINATED ARE FEDERAL RECOGNITION AND OUR GOVERNMENT- AS A RESULT OF THE ASSETS OF THE TRIBE AT THAT TIME BEANLAND- IT WAS DIVVIED UP AMONGST ARE RECOGNIZED MEMBERS AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN LAND COMES OUT OF TRUSTED INTO FEET SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND- OUR- PEOPLE WERE HISTORICALLY IMPOVERISHED AND COULD NOT AFFORD THE TAXES STILL THE LAND WAS LOST- IN. IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WE ATTEMPTED TO REESTABLISH OUR GOVERNMENT BUT IN ORDER TO REGAIN OUR RECOGNITION WE HAD TO SUE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND WE WANT OUR LAWSUIT- AND THE LAWSUIT BASICALLY SAID THAT ARE. THAT WE HAD EXISTED AS A GOVERNMENT AND WE WERE NEVER- NOT A GOVERNMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR LAND WAS LOST AT THAT TIME SO OUR TRIBE WAS LANDLESS UP UNTIL THE EARLY- TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. OUR BUT THE LAWSUIT ALSO SAID THAT ARE- ARE. OUR PERIMETER OF OUR TRUST LANDS WAS NEVER DISTANCED APPLICANT EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T ONET- THAT STILL EXISTED IT BECOMES A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION WHERE AND ONE OR TWO OR FIVE MEMBERS ON THE LITTLE PLOT OF LAND AND IT IS IN TRUST BUT THE TRIBE AS A GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HOLD TRUST LANDS. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE JURISDICTION OCCURS FOR THEM AND WHERE IT DOESN'T- SO IT IT BECAME A BIG ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY THERE ARE SEVEN FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN LAKE COUNTY SEVERAL OF THEM WERE LANDLESS AS WELL- WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RE ESTABLISH A SMALL. LAND BASED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND IT WAS FOR THE PURPOSES OF GAMING IT WAS OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT PROCESS THAT REALLY WAS A- A TESTIMONY TO HOW GOVERNMENTS CAN REESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS- FORTUNATELY FOR US- WE WERE ABLE TO OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY- BUT- AS A RESULT. OF OUR LANDLESS NIS- AND THE LACK OF POLICE FORCE AND AT THAT TIME A VERY YOUNG GOVERNMENT WHICH- WE BASICALLY HAD A CONSTITUTION AND ROMAN ORDINANCE IN AN ETHICS ORDINANCE AND- AND NOT MUCH MORE. WE RELIED SOLELY ON- THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR- FOR OUR PROTECTION- UNFORTUNATELY ALSO BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORY OUR PEOPLE AND MANY OF THE TRIBES IN THE AREA. ARE DISTRUSTFUL OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT INCLUDED LAW ENFORCEMENT- TODAY HOWEVER. WITH OUR MODERN GOVERNMENT WE- AS A RESULT OF BEING LANDLESS HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO ACQUIRE TO PUT I IN TRUST AND IN THAT TIME IT WAS FOR A GAMING. OPPORTUNITY BUT OUR- OUR SOUL- OUR SOLE EFFORT WAS REALLY TO FOCUS ON WORKING WITH THE COUNTY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THAT- POTENTIAL CASINO IN THE COMMUNITY- WE DID THAT THROUGH NEGOTIATING- A GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP. AN MOU- IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE SO IS VERY SOON AFTER OUR GOVERNMENT WAS RE ESTABLISHED. THAT PARLAYED INTO CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT BY THE COMMUNITY WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE TRUST PROCESS TRYING TO PUT OUR LAND INTO TRUST- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ONLY ABLE TO REESTABLISH ELEVEN ACRES. SO WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW A LOT LARGE TRIBAL LAND BASE ANYMORE- BUT IT WAS THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS- WITH WORKING WITH THE COUNTY- NOR SURE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES. ESTABLISHING AN MO YOU FOR FIRE PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. REALLY WAS AN EYE OPENER FOR US AS TO THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS- I THINK IT REALLY ESTABLISHED A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND THAT HELPED US ALONG- YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THOUGH WE MET PRETTY REGULARLY WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS AND- AT NORTH SHORE FIRE PROTECTION. THAT DID NOT A IT WASN'T A PANACEA. I AM FORTUNATELY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. WE EXPERIENCED AN ISSUE OF STAGING IN WHAT WAS DEEMED ARE- FOR PERCEIVED AS BEING OUR TRIBE OUR TRIBAL LANDS- THE LOCAL- EMERGENCY SERVICES DID NOT REALIZE THAT. THAT THOSE PLANS WERE NOT IN TRUST. BUT IT RESULTED IN THE STAGING INCIDENT WHERE. EMERGENCY SERVICE RESPONDERS WOULD NOT COME OUT TO WHAT THEY DEEMED AS OUR RESERVATION BECAUSE OF- A RECENT ISSUE THAT THEY HAD HAD AN OR- IN A RECENT CALL. BUT THEY LACKED CALL CONTACT TO THE GOVERNMENT TO INFORM US OF THE ISSUE. AND AS A RESULT OF DELAY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BECAUSE THEY WANTED- AND EXPORT TO COME ONTO OUR LANDS- THEY A FAMILY MEMBER PASSED AWAY. THAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE RESULTED AND A HUGE UPROAR WITH OUR OUR OUR OUR PEOPLE. AND A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR US AS A GOVERNMENT- BECAUSE WE COULD NOT WE WERE SOLELY RELIANT ON THOSE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE. WE WERE ABLE TO- HAVE SEVERAL MEETINGS WHICH RESULTED AND THE- THE AGENCY. DEVELOPING A STAGING POLICY THERE IS A CALLING PROTOCOL IN PLACE NOW BECAUSE- I'M THE FIRST ONE THEY CALL IF THERE'S EVER AN ISSUE THAT WOULD IMPACT THEIR SERVICES OF OUR COMMUNITY- AND THERE'S OTHERS YOU KNOW BEHIND ME. BUT SINCE THEN WE'VE NEVER HAD A STAGING ISSUE AT ALL. BUT IT REMINDED US THAT EVEN WITH THEM OF USE THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE HAD TO DO MORE AND UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN WITH OUR COMMUNITY BEING VERY POOR IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET RESOURCES TO PUT ON TRAININGS- BUT AT. OUR TRIBE AFTER. A LOT OF WORK AND EFFORT I HAVE A BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES REVENUES TO OUR TRIBE AND WE HAVE- ESTABLISHED ON GOING- TRAININGS IN THE COMMUNITY OF SUBJECT MATTERS OF PL TWO EIGHTY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN INDIAN CHILD WELFARE AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL CRIMES- IT HAS REALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR US AND FORTUNATELY WITH OUR NEW SHERIFF. HE HAS BEEN VERY VERY MUCH. GATHER HAVE PUT ON THESE TRAININGS FAIRLY REGULARLY WINS IN FACT WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING UP- TOWARDS THE END OF THIS YEAR. BUT IT WAS ALSO YOU KNOW VERY MUCH- I'D AND AN ISSUE- IT THAT ONE ONE TRAINING IN A COMMUNITY ISN'T ENOUGH- I WAS ASKED TO SIT ON A PANEL TO HIRE THE NEW LIEUTENANT. IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND MARK MY QUESTIONS TO THEM WERE ALL AROUND PEEL TO EIGHTY ANDIT WAS VERY CLEAR EVEN ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD GONE THROUGH THE RECENT TRAINING. DID NOT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. THERE IS NEEDS TO BE CONSTANT AND ONGOING INFORMATION AND EDUCATION EARLY ON AND PRETTY REGULARLY WITH TRIBES- COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- OUR TRIBE USE THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD GAINED THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE MO YOU AND WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TWO OF DEVELOP OTHER AMMO USE OF SIGNIFICANCE- A. B. FIFTY TWO WHICH PROVIDES TRIBES OF A VOICE IN- IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES. TO CONSULT WITH TRIBES THAT RESULTED IN CREATING AN AMMO AS WITH OUR LOCAL AUTHORITY AND I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT WE HAVE ONGOING TRAINING FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL CRIMES- WE WERE ABLE TO. PROVIDE AN EDUCATIONAL FILM ON THAT THAT I THINK CAN REALLY ONE A LONG WAY BECAUSE IT INVOLVED- THE SHARE OF IT INVOLVES THE GOVERNOR THEN GOVERNOR BROWN TRIBAL LEADERSHIP ON WHAT IT MEANS TO US WHEN BONDS OR ARTIFACTS ARE FOUND ON OUR FORMER LANDS. AND HOW WE CAN- RESOLVE TO REPATRIATE THEM OR REBURIED THEM SO WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AMMO USE WITH THE COUNTY IN NORTH SHORE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT ON EMERGENCY SERVICES AROUND. ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS AND LANDS THAT WE ACQUIRED- NOTABLY- OUR TRIBE HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH. VARIOUS ATTORNEYS GENERALS OF THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ONLINE BUSINESS E. COMMERCE IS VITAL TO OUR TRIBE BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED LAND BASE AND- YEAH RULE LOCATION BUT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO MEMORANDUMS OF AGREEMENT WITH THE OF THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW MEXICO- ONE OF THE VERY. POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF BUILDING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND I THINK THAT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF OUR YOUNG MOTHERS WOULDN'T WAS MURDERED BY HER- BY HER SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND THE FATHER OF THREE OF HER. MINOR CHILDREN IN FRONT OF THOSE. ABC THE SHERIFF WHAT'S CALLED. TO RESPOND AND THEY BASICALLY THEY WITNESSED THE LIFE BEING BEATEN OUT OF HER AND- FORTUNATELY- OF THE SHERIFF KNEW US AND KNEW OUR INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ADVOCATE AND CONTACTED HER DIRECTLY SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE- CUSTODY OF THOSE THREE CHILDREN SO THAT THEY DID NOT GO INTO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT- THE ONGOING RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE SHERIFF THOSE CHILDREN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM. INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ISSUES VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ISSUES JUST THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF PL TWO EIGHTY IS VITAL TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. I'M I'M I'M VERY HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I'M THANKFUL IT IS UNFORTUNATELY TOO LATE FOR SOME OF OUR PEOPLE BUT THE MORE EFFORTS TOWARDS FINDING AND TRAININGS AND- WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK WILL DEFINITELY BE A FACTOR. IN TURNING THE TIMES AND THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED AS TRIBAL PEOPLE AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU- CHAIRWOMAN. FOR THAT- DESCRIPTION AND MANY TIMES AND IN A COUNTRY YOU BRING UP THE STAGE AND I MEAN I REMEMBER THE RESERVATION WERE- DEPUTIES THAT WOULD RESPOND WITH PARKED ON THE STREET ND TELL FIVE OR SIX UNITS COULD SHOW UP AND THEN THEY COME IN AND FORCE FOR SOMEONE THAT MAYBE SLIPPED AND FELL- SOMEONE THAT WAS MAYBE HAVING ALTERCATION RIGHT THOSE THINGS WHICH YOU BRING TO CENTER STAGE THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE. AND THAT'S THE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN THAT WE COULD BE MORE PROACTIVE IN PRE VENT THAT THEN THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE HAD IT- THE DESCRIPTION AND MY CONDOLENCES FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE FOR THE SITUATION HAS HAPPENED. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS IS SEEING THAT. THAT HAPPEN RIGHT THAT THAT THAT ACTION WHERE'S THE RESOURCES THE MENTAL RESOURCES FOR THAT. AND AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT HISTORIC TRAUMA. IS NOT JUST HISTORIC IT'S STILL HAPPENING NOW. BUT UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO GO BACK IN TIME IN THE HISTORY DURING THE COLONIZATION PERIOD AND MET. THAT THAT HISTORIC TRAUMA STARTED THERE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK FORWARD TO START TO REALLY. MOVE FORWARD ON TRUTH AND HEALING FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS COMMITTED TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

THE FLOOR IS YOURS. EMILY I AM BOTTLE OF ALMELO UNAI. HELLO EVERYONE GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND INTRODUCTION CHAIRWOMAN. AS YOU SHARED MY NAME IS MARY LOPEZ KIEFER AND I SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AT THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- I WISH TO THANK YOU BOTH- CHAIRMAN RAMOS AND CHAIRWOMAN. GARCIA AND THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEES- BOTH THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- IT IS TRULY AN HONOR. ADD TO BE INVITED BY BOTH OF YOUR ESTEEM COMMITTEES TO DISCUSS ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY NINETY NINE. AT TODAY I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY NINETY NINE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA IS COMMITMENT TO WORKING IN COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION WITH OUR LOCAL STATE TRIBAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND SURVIVORS AND FAMILIES IMPACTED BY LOVED ONES WHO HAVE GONE MISSING AND OR HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE. I ALSO WISH TO THANK MY FELLOW PANELISTS TODAY FOR SHARING BOTH THEIR PERSONAL. AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES WITH THE MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN MOVEMENT AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY. A HAS HAD IN CALIFORNIA INDIAN COUNTRY AND ITS NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS. AS YOU HEARD TODAY CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATIONS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE PEOPLE. THE MOST RECENT TWENTY TWENTY DATA OF FOR THE CENSUS ESTIMATES THAT ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVES. CALL CALIFORNIA HOME I COUNTY FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT 6% OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ACCORDING TO TWENTY NINETEEN CENSUS DATA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST SHARE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVES IN CALIFORNIA WITH APPROXIMATELY 21% LIVING WITHIN THIS COUNTY. THE GENDER DISTRIBUTION OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ACCOUNTING FOR AROUND 50% OF THE POPULATION. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND SIXTY SEVEN NON FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED RESERVATIONS AND RANCHERIAS. THAT NEIGHBOR THIRTY FOUR OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EIGHTY THIRTY NINETY NINE CREATED THE NEW TRAVEL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. AB THIRTY NINETY NINE HAS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITIES THAT REMAINING CALIFORNIA INDIAN COUNTRY. REGARDING THE INCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION APPEAL TO EIGHTY IT REQUIRES THE DOJ TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP REDUCE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING CRIMINAL JURISDICTION AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY ON TRIBAL LANDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF AB THIRTY NINE NINE THE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING. CALLS FOR THE DOJ TO STUDY CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION OF MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND GIRLS. THIS COMPONENT WILL REQUIRE THE DOJ TO PREPARE A REPORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL BARRIERS THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LACK OF REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION AND MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. WELL THESE TWO SEPARATE WELL THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE LAW THERE ARE VERY MUCH INTERRELATED AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY NINE NINE WILL HAVE INPUT INTO IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. WELL IT IS ACCURATE THAT THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE LAW ONLY IMPACTS THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT HAVE RESERVATIONS OR RANCHERIAS AND THE THIRTY FOUR COUNTIES THAT NEIGHBOR THOSE RESERVATIONS OR RANCHERIAS THE SECOND COMPONENT RELATING TO CALIFORNIA'S MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE R. MM N. A. P. CALLS FOR A STATEWIDE STUDY THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL AREAS IN WHICH ALL NATIVE AMERICANS LIVE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND I SHARED WITH YOU BY MY FELLOW PANELISTS. IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. YOU THE US CONGRESS ENACTED PL TWO EIGHTY. EXPRESSLY TRANSFERRING FEDERAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OVER MOST CRIMES COMMITTED BY OR AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS ON INDIAN LAND FOR THE FEDERAL JURISDICTION. I MEAN FOR HIS NAME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FIVE AND THEN LATER SIX STATES. THESE STATES WERE KNOWN AS THE MANDATORY PL TWO EIGHTY STATES. AND THE STATES COULD NOT REFUSE JURISDICTION. PL TWO EIGHTY PROVIDED NO FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. NOR DID THE LAW REQUIRE CONSENT OF THE AFFECTED TRIBES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PO TWO EIGHTY DID NOT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT CROP TRIBAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION AND THEREFORE THE TRIBES AND THE STATE SHARE CONCURRENT CRIMINAL JURISDICTION IN INDIAN COUNTRY. AS SUCH THE TRIBES MAY EXERCISE THEIR TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY BY ESTABLISHING TRIBAL COURTS AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE SIX MANDATORY APPEAL TO EIGHTY STATES AND ALTHOUGH PL TWO EIGHTY HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS. IT'S REQUIREMENTS AND IMPLICATIONS OFTEN REMAIN CONFUSING AMONG STATE. LOCAL AND TRIBAL AUTHORITIES GENERALLY PEEL TO EIGHTIES COMPLEXITIES CAN AND HAS LED TO PUBLIC SAFETY UNCERTAINTY AND FRUSTRATION AMONG TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS. THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FRUSTRATION HAS UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN PEEL TO EIGHTY BEING APPLIED INCONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND AS CHAIRMAN RAMOS EXPRESSED EARLIER HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ISSUES HEAVILY IMPACT BUT CAUSES RESULTS AND RESOLUTION OF VIOLENCE ON TRIBAL LANDS. THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA'S TREATMENT OF ITS NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS AS GOVERNOR NEWSOM EXPRESSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONE OF GENOCIDE. FILLED WITH UNSPEAKABLE TRAUMA FROM STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES AND LAWS. THAT HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECT ON ITS NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. THE STATE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE EIGHTEEN AND RATIFY TREATIES IT'S LAWS ALLOWING CHILDREN TO BE TAKEN FORCEFULLY FROM THEIR FAMILIES INSTITUTING INDENTURED SERVITUDE FOR NATIVE AMERICANS OF ALL AGES AND GENDERS AND ITS ROLE IN INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTORS. THAT ARE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH. THROUGH VARIOUS STUDIES AND LITERATURE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS HISTORICAL TRAUMA IS STILL VERY MUCH PRESENT TODAY IN HOW ARE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION EXPERIENCES VIOLENCE AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OUR SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AB THIRTY NINETY NINE IS BUT A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING CONCERNS SURROUNDINGMISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA'S STRATEGY IN ADDRESSING AND AMEND THE P. AB THIRTY NINETY NINE SPECIFICALLY CALLS UPON THE DOJ TO ALSO CONDUCT A STUDY TO DETERMINE HOW TO INCREASE STATE CRIMINAL JURISDICTION PROTECTIVE AND INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES FOR REPORTING AND IDENTIFYING MISSING AND OR MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. THE STUDY MUST INCLUDE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING. A DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE OF MISSING AND ARE MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. IDENTIFICATION OF BARRIERS IN REPORTING OR INVESTIGATING MISSING AND OR MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND LASTLY WAYS TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE CROSS REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION OF MISSING AND ARE MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE. LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING TRAVEL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AS PART OF THE STUDY THE DEPARTMENT IS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO CALIFORNIA TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT'S INCLUDING OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES AND OUR- ALSO THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN TRIBAL LANDS AND LOCAL AND STATE FEDERAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COURTS. AND LASTLY THE DOJ IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT SHALL INCLUDE. DATA AND ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. IDENTIFICATION OF THE BARRIERS TO PROVIDING STATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS M. M. AN A. P. AND RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION A MISSING AND ARE MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. I SHARED WITH US BY CHAIRMAN GARCIA THE DOJ WILL RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY NINETY NINE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS COMMENCING NEXT MONTH. THANK YOU. THIS FUNDING WILL PROVIDE THE DOJ WITH THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE TWO COMPONENTS OF AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. IN PREPARATION FOR THE MNA P. COMPONENT OF THE LAW THE OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA HAS BEGUN TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER ENTITIES. CONDUCTING SIMILAR STUDIES AND REPORTS ON MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EITHER OFTEN REFERENCED AS MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT FOR CALIFORNIA OUR LAW STATES THAT IT'S MISSING MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR INSTANCE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. OPERATION LADY JUSTICE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN LATER TO BE RENAMED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. HAS DONE- AND CONTINUES TO DO SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH THAT ASSIST LOCAL STATE AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS M. M. I. P. ORGANIZATIONS. MOREOVER TEN OTHER STATES HAVE BEGUN TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS WITHIN THEIR BORDERS. OF THOSE TEN STATES FOR WERE MIGHT MANDATORY PL TWO EIGHTY STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA. A MAJORITY OF THESE REPORTS HAVE FOUND THAT NATIVE AMERICANS MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF BOTH MISSING PERSONS AND VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE. FOR INSTANCE IN MINNESOTA A MANDATORY PL TWO EIGHTY STATE. IT FOUND THAT AMERICAN INDIANS MADE UP 2% OF THEIR STATE'S POPULATION AND AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS COMPRISED 1% YET IN ANY GIVEN MONTH AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS MADE UP 15% OF THE FEMALES MISSING CASES. AN 8% OF ALL FEMALE HOMICIDES. HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT AS TO WHAT IS OCCURRING IN OTHER STATES AND WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS AT OPERATION LADY JUSTICE CAUTION THAT EVEN THOUGH MMI PETE IS A NATIONAL CRISIS THE RESEARCH DOES NOT INDICATE THAT EVERY STATE OR EVERY TRY WILL BE IMPACTED IN THE SAME WAY. OR AT ALL. NINE OF THE TEN STATES THAT HAVE ISSUED THEIR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BURIED IN THEIR REPORTING. HOWEVER THE REPORTS EACH IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS SYSTEMIC BARRIERSTO TRACKING VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS. THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE RACIAL MIS CLASSIFICATION JUDICIAL I'M SIDNEY JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES AND SIGNIFICANT DISTRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETHING YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER TODAY. THE RECOMMENDATIONS MOST COMMONLY IDENTIFIED WHERE THE FOLLOWING. ONE TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND EDUCATION A MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS AND ACCESS TO THE DATA SYSTEMS BY NON. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAININGS ON INTERACTING WITH TRIBAL PEOPLE AND REPORTING PROTOCOLS AND LASTLY TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT WITH TRIBES. THERE ARE IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE FINDINGS WERE MADE ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDING THE INADEQUACIES OF THE MISSING PERSONS DATABASES BOTH STATE AND NATIONWIDE AT THE HIGHER LEVELS OF RACIAL THIS CLASSIFICATION. LACK A TRIBAL AFFILIATION OR TRIBAL CITIZENSHIP INFORMATION AND THE SITUATION OF UNDER REPORTING. THE DOJ HAS ALSO BEGUN TO MEET INFORMALLY WITH TRIBAL LEADERS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES TRAVEL ADVOCATES AND OTHERS TO ASSIST US IN HOW WE SHOULD BEST APPROACH AB THIRTY NINETY NINES IMPLEMENTATION. MOVING FORWARD THE OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN COORDINATION WITH THE DOJ'S RESEARCH CENTER AND DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE ENGAGING IN LISTENING SESSIONS TO DISCUSS MMN A P. AND WILL BE INCLUSIVE TO ALL PERSPECTIVES ON THE ISSUES PRESENTED. THESE LISTENING SESSIONS WILL BE HELD STATE WIDE BOTH VIRTUALLY AND IN PERSON WHERE APPROPRIATE. AND TRIBAL AND WE WOULD ALSO- LIKE TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM OUR FEDERAL STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL COUNTERPARTS AND OUR TRIBAL ADVOCACY PARTNERS. MORE OVER WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT ARE INCLUSIVE EFFORTS. IN ASSESSING THE SCOPE OF THE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND DOJ'S COMMITMENT TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND BODIES THAT AB THIRTY NINETY NINE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE WORK AHEAD WILL NOT BE EASY BUT ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OUR DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED IN AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS MORNING'S HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THE WORK ABILITY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO- COMPLY WITH AB THIRTY NINETY NINE.

BILL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTY NINETY NINE I WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT- MISTER LOPEZ KEEPER.

IT'S THERE WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO WE DID SAY THAT THIS WASN'T THE END OF IT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF ALL THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. FOR MAKE UP FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF THE VOICES BEEN ABSENT AND A LOT OF THESE- AREAS YOU HEARD IT HERE TODAY. WITH THE TESTIMONY- WITH ALL THOSE PRISONERS THAT ARE THERE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE AT THIS TIME. ABOUT ANYONE ON THE PHONES. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AT TEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND INTO THE LEGISLATORS IN THE MEMBERS ARE HERE WITH US FROM WITHIN THE WOMAN'S POCKETS AND- SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I ME HEARING THE TESTIMONY OF ISSUES. THAT ON THIS BODY HASN'T BEEN ENGAGED IN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTY NINETY NINE. AND HE HEARD A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY MOVING FORWARD. AT THIS TIME WE WANT TO OPEN UP FOR LEGISLATORS THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON- YES I WANT TO THANK BOTH CHAIRS FOR. PUTTING THIS ON VERY INFORMATIVE- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I DO HAVE FOR A FUTURE DISCUSSION. WOULD BE. FROM THE SHARE FROM HOPE HUMBOLDT WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE COMMUNICATIONS- SITUATION WHERE THEIR OWN COMMUNICATIONS CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS BUT MOST IS. BUT MOST OF. THE OTHER TRIBES DO NOT HAVE THESE COMMUNICATIONS THIS IS NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW WHEN ANYBODY WHO GOES MISSING GETTING THAT INTO A SYSTEM THAT GOES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF NOT ONLY FINDING. THE MISSING CHILDREN- BUT THE TAKE YOUR AWAY ON THIS TOPIC- MISSING NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN SO US LOOKING AT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND HOW TO GET ACCESS FOR OTHER TRIBES I THINK WOULD BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- MADAM MAJORITY LEADER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT I WANT TO SAY MY HEART IS FULL I KNOW THAT WITH OUR YOUNG LEADERS AND WITH THE OTHER LEADERS THE ADVOCATES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THIS IS GOING TO GO AWAY. IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHO'S AT THE TABLE AND HAVING ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RAMOS HERE AT THE STATE ASSEMBLY. HAVING HIM CONVENE AND NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND NOW HAVING THE SELECT COMMITTEE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE HAVING YOU ALL HERE TODAY MADE A DIFFERENCE AND I WANTED TO KNOW THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. TO MAKING SURE THE IT IS WAS A DRESS THAT WE FOLLOW IN THE LEAD OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS IN ADDRESSING THIS. AND FOR OUR YOUNG WOMAN FROM FROM THE SOME OF THE TRIBE I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW VERY PROUD I AM OF YOUR CONTINUED WORK IN THIS IN THIS FIELD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AMOUNT OF MAJORITY LEADER ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT NATIVE AMERICAN. EXPERIENCE AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. IF YOU SEE IT IN CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT CONSIDERED A VIOLENT CRIME. THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. CHAMPIONING A CHILD FOR SEX. IS NOT CONSIDERED A LOT OF CRIME OR THE PEOPLE OF. HATE CRIMES WHICH WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL. IS NOT CONSIDERED A LOT OF CRIME IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE WHICH IS NONSENSICAL IN MY OPINION OBVIOUSLY IF YOU COMMIT THESE CRIMES. ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE. UPON THE TOUGHEST THING THEY SHOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOLKS TALKED ABOUT WERE MISSING PERSONS. AND IT'S- MISSING PERSON CASES ARE TOUGH NUMBER ONE. BECAUSE IN THE VAST MAJORITY CASES. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NOT GO OUT THERE TO LOOK FOR THAT PERSON. A LESSER RISK OR MAYBE UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE. BUT THEY RECEIVE SO MANY MISSING PERSON CASES. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SO INUNDATED. OTHER THE INTERNET GETTING INFORMATION AND- FUND THE REPORTING ENDING INTO A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T INVESTIGATE MISSING PERSON CASES SO IT'S TOUGH FULLER SOME OF THE PIE THE TOUGHEST CASES. AND GOES SITE WHICH ONES THAT THAT WARRANT- FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND WHICH DON'T AND THEN THE MAJORITY DON'T FOR THE MOST EVERYBODY. THIS WILL SIMPLE THINGS YOU TAKE MISSING PERSON CASES EVERY DAY AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT THE NEW LAST LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT- MOST THE FOLKS. ARE MISSING- END UP COMING BACK NOT ALL CASES BUT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE REALITY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES AND- IF YOU PUT OUT MISSING PERSONS EVERY DAY ON TV OR PUT OUT PRESS RELEASES- PRISON IT BECOMES WHITE NOISE THEY DREADED DEFINITELY BALANCE AND THERE'S- THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT- BUT YOU KNOW WE DO THIS THIS IS A START- I WANT TO THANK BOTH CHAIRS FOR IT FOR COMPLETING THIS- INFORMATIONAL HEARING- GO START SOMEWHERE. SO IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THE DISCUSSION ONE THINK OF SPEAKERS ARE VERY INFORMATIVE I LEARNT A LOT TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN TEAMS DISCUSSION AND HOW WE. CAN RESOLVE THESE ISSUES THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. GROUP OF NEXT TO IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MATTER CHOI FOR US TOGETHER ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT THAT I WANTED TO SAY THAT. THEY'RE SITTING HERE LISTENING TO TESTIMONY AND- THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY- CONSISTENTLY HAS COME UP HI TO SHARE THAT THE FIRST TIME I SET FOOT IN THIS BUILDING I WAS AN INTERN FOR THE CABAZON BAND OF MISSION INDIANS. AND WE WERE LOBBYING IN TWO THOUSAND ONE FOR SENATE BILL NINE ELEVEN SENATOR RICHARD A LOT OF GOING BILL. DEALING WITH TRIBAL JUSTICE DEALING WITH- PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY AND WHAT I REMEMBER WAS HOW DIFFICULT OF A BATTLE THAT WAS WITHIN TRIBAL. COUNTRY AND WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT STATEWIDE TO- DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE CLARITY OF BOUNDARIES WHEN IT COMES TO JURISDICTIONAL. ENFORCEMENT ON IN INDIAN COUNTRY AND TODAY RIGHT THAT CONSISTENTLY- I WAS BROUGHT UP WHEN IT COMES TO. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING AND DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE REALLY AT THE CORE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WITH- MISSING YOUNG LADIES AND WOMEN IN INDIAN COUNTRY. AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT- THAT ISSUE WAS THEN AND CAN IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TODAY TO TACKLE THAT. BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MANAGER- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF ADDRESSING- MISSING INDIGENOUS YOUNG LADIES AND WOMEN WE HAVE TO GET TO. THE CORE OF WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FOLLOWING THROUGH. WITH THE CRIMINAL SIDE OF THE WORK- BUT BEFORE THAT I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING- THE ROOT CAUSES- GOING BACK. TO MUCH OF WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TO DATE AS IT RELATES TO RECOGNIZING THE HISTORY- THAT HAS- REALLY CAUSED. A LOT OF THIS PAIN AND SUFFERING OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I'M I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION AND THINKING BACK OF. WHETHER HOW MUCH WORK- REMAINS TO BE DONE- OR REALLY HOW MUCH. HAS NOT CHANGED. WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN ISSUES. RELATED TO OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY AND THEN PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. AND WITH OUR NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL AND MAYBE YOU KNOW TAKE TAKE ANOTHER STAB AT THIS ISSUE AND- AND WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THERE'S A- UP A NEW- TONE. WHEN IT COMES TO LAW IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS A DESIRE TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH- WHEN IT COMES TO- JUSTICE I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE VOTERS A DESIRE TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION- A NEW APPROACH FROM DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND SHERIFFS THAT ARE BEING ELECTED UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING. OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THAT THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AT THIS AND SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND- JUST APPRECIATE ALL OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER- MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIRMAN- ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT.

L. BRINGS TO MIND IS THE LACK OF POLICE FORCE OUT IN THAT AREA IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY OR TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND- I KNOW THAT I'M SURE I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THE- SURE FROM HUMBOLDT COUNTY BUT I'M SURE HE ONLY HAS A HANDFUL OF SHERIFF'S. YOU MAY ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO SHOWS ON DUTY IN THE EVENING OVER A LARGE RANGE OF AREA. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT UNLIKE COUNTY THEY ONLY HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE ON ON SITE. AND A WHOLE EVENING AND A BIG LARGE COUNTY. SO SOMEONE WANT TO REFLECT ON AS TO HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE WE RESPOND AND HELP OUR TRIBES. I'M DOING THE MOST IMPORTANT TIMES- IN. A DIFFICULT TIMES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF WHERE THEY GO TO AND ARE THEY GOING TO GET ANY KIND OF RESPONSE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT- AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL I WANT TO THANK THEM ADJOURNMENT WOMAN TRIP UP. YOU MADE A REALLY GOOD COMMENT THAT I LEARNED A LOT. OF DURING MY TIME HERE IS THAT WE NEED MORE CULTURAL AWARENESS IS HOW WE WORK WITH OUR TRIBES AND I THINK THERE'S- OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS OUR- NONPROFITS NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE WORK BETTER WITH- OUR TRIBAL. OF FRIENDS SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR TESTIFYING TODAY THANK YOU FOR THIS TODAY. BUT I THINK THERE'S MANY THINGS WE NEED TO- DISCUSS. AS WE TRY TO HELP OUT. THANK YOU.

TO GATHER- I AT THE BUSINESS CHAIR KNOWS- I REPRESENT THE BISHOP SHOSHONE.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TEETH IN THESE THESE PEOPLE EVEN IF WE ARE TO TRACK THEM DOWN TO CATCH THEM. THEY GET RELEASED. AND SO THERE THERE'S THINGS AND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE. IT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO GO IN AND LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THINGS AGO NO THIS IS NOT OKAY AND THIS IS GOING TO STOP. AND WE'RE GOING A. AS. CECILIA JUST MENTIONED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ON THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THAT OUR PARTNERS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE DO ALL THIS WORK TO DO THESE ANIMAL USE. WITH OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS. BUT THESE ARE RURAL AREAS. VERY VERY MANY OF THEM. ARE EXTREMELY RURAL AREAS. SHOAL. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK DURING THOSE HIGH. HERE IT'S TO KEEP AN EYE OUT TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR YOUTH ARE GETTING SNATCHED UP IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE THEY'RE KEEPING THAT AND I'D LIKE TO PROTECT THEM. WHAT ARE WE REALLY DOING AND- BECAUSE WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE TO THE POINT WHERE HAVING HEARING AIDS BUT WE CAN HAVE HEARING AFTER HEARING AFTER HEARING WE HAVE TO ACT.

WITH BOTH AB THIRTY NINETY NINE WITH THIS HEARING WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND- THAT IS NORTH THAT WE NEED TO DO.
