ORDER THE HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION OF JULY THIRD. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE TODAY WE HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE BILLS ON THE AGENDA. AND I NOTICED THAT -- SENDS THE JACKSON IS HERE WITH US SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE. TO ASK YOU TO COME UP TO PRESENT HER BILLS WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO PROCEED AS A A SUBCOMMITTEE SO WELCOME A SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU I'M MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. A I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY IS NOW. TAKING THE FRONT AND CENTER ROLE THAT IT. SHOULD BE TAKING. AND DOT IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO PRESENT. SENATE BILL. THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH SEEKS TO CREATE A COMMON SENSE KERRY REQUIREMENT. FOR INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES. THING SUCH AS WIRELESS ROUTERS. PURITY CAMERAS AND SMART CITY INFRASTRUCTURE. IT DOES SO BY DIRECTING MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DEVICES. TO EQUIP THEIR PRODUCTS WITH REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES. YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS SORT OF A GIVEN. BUT THE FACT IS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENT. THAT THEY DO THIS. SO OUR I'D FIRST LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED. IN THE IN ALICE'S AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOUR STAFF. UP FOR THEIR DILIGENCE HERE I THINK THERE ARE APPROPRIATE AND HELPFUL AND WILL -- GO ALONG WAY TO ACHIEVING THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE AND DELIGHTED TO ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE INDUSTRY TECH AND IN PARTICULAR AND I THINK THEY'RE HERE TO TESTIFY AS WELL -- YOU KNOW IT WE LIVE IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD WHERE INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES HAVE MOVED WELL. BEYOND TRADITIONAL DESKTOP COMPUTERS AND I LOOK AT THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING THAT YOU. DON'T ALREADY KNOW. BUT TODAY'S ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE BILLION OF THEM. THEY INCLUDE MICROWAVES AND REFRIGERATORS AND HOME DEVICES. LIKE THERMOSTATS AND SECURITY CAMERAS UNFORTUNATELY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE DEVICES. LACK EVEN THE MOST BASIC SECURITY FEATURES. SUCH AS CHANGEABLE PASSWORDS AND USER ACCESS CONTROLS. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST. OUR INTERNET CONNECTED TOYS. AND THE RISKS THAT THEY POSE TO OUR CHILDREN AND THIS IS WHAT. DREW ME TO THIS ISSUE -- ORIGINALLY. THE KELLY DAHLE. WHICH THE COUNTRY OF GERMANY HAS NOW BANNED AND CONFISCATED. BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD GLEAN FROM CHILDREN. OR DIRECT CHILDREN GO TO PLACES. WHERE THEY WOULD BE UNSAFE? THE THE IMAGINATION AND INVENTIVENESS OF THE HUMAN MIND IS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED AND THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS USE FOR GOOD. AND NOT FOR POTENTIAL EVIL SO. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND AS I MENTION THAT THIS AT ALL. HAS A SECURITY FLAW. THAT ALLOW STRANGERS TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO CHILDREN VIA THE DAHLE FROM UP TO FIFTY FEET AWAY. INCLUDING THROUGH THE WALLS OF A CHILD'S BEDROOM. FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF STRANGERS TALKING TO CHILDREN THROUGH INSECURE BABY MONITORS. RESEARCHERS HAVE ALSO INCLUDE ARE CONCLUDED. THE THOUSANDS OF INSECURE WEB CAMERAS MADE BY THE CHINESE SELECTRIC ELECTRONICS BERMAN I CAN'T. DO JUSTICE TO THE NAME IS SHOWN MAY. WERE TAKEN OVER BY HACKERS AND TURNED INTO A BOTNET ARMY. DURING A MAJOR CYBERATTACK IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT DISABLED THE WEBSITES OF TWITTER SPOTIFY THE NEW YORK TIMES IN AIRBNB. AND I AM NOT ALONE IN THOSE CONCERNS THE PUBLIC IS ALSO GRAVELY AWARE OF THIS IN SECURITY. AND OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN NASDAQ JAMAL TOE SURVEY FOUND THAT. 90% OF CONSUMERS LACK CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY OF INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES. MOST ORGANIZATIONS 96%. AND 90% OF CONSUMERS BELIEVE THERE'S A NEED FOR I OR T. SECURITY REGULATIONS AND WANT GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. AND A HACKER CONTROLLING I O. T. DEVICES IS THE MOST COMMON CONCERN OF CONSUMERS. WHILE SIXTEEN PIN WORRY ABOUT THEIR DATA BEING STOLEN. THESE ARE CONCERNS THAT HAS TIME HAS EVOLVED HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE ACCURATE. I AM NOT A TECHNICAL. I AM ON MY PHONE HYPE LAPTOP AS MUCH AS ANYONE I SHOULD ADMIT TO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL ON THEM TOO MUCH. BUT I GET IT MY FACE TIME WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN REGULARLY. IT'S A JOY FOR ANYONE WHO -- HAS GRANDCHILDREN OF COURSE THEN WHEN YOU SHOW UP THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO SEE A REAL PERSON IN THREE DIMENSIONS BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY. THAT THAT WILL PROBABLY GET FIXED AT SOME POINT AS WELL. AND I AM AS EXCITED BY THE AS IS THE NEXT PERSON BY NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. THAT ALLOW US TO CONNECT IN NEW WAYS TO GIVE US ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT OUR FINGERTIPS. BUT I AM CONCERNED WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES PROCEED WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO EQUIP THEIR INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES. WITH REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE MACHINE IT USE. WHICH COULD INCLUDE SUCH THINGS AS THE ABILITY. CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORDS OR DETECT POTENTIAL HACKERS THESE AMENDMENTS ALLOWING THREE TWENTY SEVEN WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN CHAU T. SECURITY BILL AB. NINETEEN OH SIX WHICH THIS COMMITTEE PASSED A COUPLE MONTHS AGO BRINGING TOGETHER THE ELEMENTS THE BEST OF BOTH OF THESE BILLS. THERE IS NO QUESTION TECHNOLOGY HAS AND CONTINUES TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR LIVES. BUT IT'S UP TO US AS POLICY MAKERS TO ENSURE THE TECHNOLOGY SERVES THE PEOPLE. AND THAT SECURITY IS NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT BUT RATHER A KEY COMPONENT OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THESE OF THIS BILL TODAY ARE SOME OF THE LEADERS ON THESE ISSUES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY. AND THE POLICY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM SAMANTHA CORBIN FROM COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION. EYES EMILY RUSH HERE EMILY EMILY SH IT IS HERE YES THANK YOU -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALPERS AND ROSEMARY SHAM WITH CARS. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. I THINK THAT'S ME MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING THROUGHOUT THE CORPSMAN ON BEHALF OF COMMON SENSE MEDIA SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THIS HARD WORK FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND JUST GENERALLY ALL THE WORK. THAT YOU'VE DONE CHAMPIONING PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND COMMON SENSE MEDIA IS IN ADVOCACY ARM OR COMMONSENSE ACTUALLY SEES ME AS THE POLICY AND ADVOCACY ARM OF COMMON SENSE MEDIA AND WORKS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS WHAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE IN A WORLD OF MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY. MORE AND MORE FAMILIES ARE WELCOMING CONNECTED DEVICES IN THEIR HOMES FROM THE AMAZON ECHO ONTO GOOGLE HOME TO SMART TV'S TALKING TEDDY BEARS AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS THOSE. AT THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN THE RUSH TO GET THESE PRODUCTS OUT TO MARKET -- AS CONNECTIVITY MOVES FROM COMPUTERS AND CELLPHONES TO EVERYTHING FROM TEDDY BEARS TO TOASTERS WERE PUTTING MORE OF OURSELVES AND MORE OF OUR CHILDREN. AT RISK THE COMBINATION OF INSECURITY INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND MASSIVE AND OFTEN UNEXPECTED INFORMATION COLLECTION CREATES A TRIPLE WHAMMY WHERE ME FOR FAMILIES. AND EXPERTS PREDICT THE HACKING OF SMART DEVICES WILL ONLY INCREASE IN COMING YEARS LEADING. TO EVERYTHING FROM PRIVACY HARM TO PHYSICAL RISK INDUSTRY LEADERS THEMSELVES HAVE SOUNDED THE ALARM THAT CONNECTED DEVICES ARE DESPERATELY BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY STANDARDS AND NINE OUT OF TEN CONSUMERS LACK CONFIDENCE AND THE SECURITY OF CONNECTED DEVICES. BY ENSURING THAT CONNECTED DEVICES MEET BASIC SECURITY STANDARDS APPROPRIATE TO THE NATURE OF THE DEVICE AND THE INFORMATION THAT THEY COLLECT S. B. THREE TWO SEVEN ONE ACT COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS THAT GET FAMILIES THE PEACE OF MIND THEY DESERVE. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TIME EMILY RATS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COW PARA THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP. I'M LIKE SENATOR JACKSON AND COMMON SENSE KIDS I THINK WE CAME TO THIS ISSUE LOOKING FIRST AND FOREMOST AT CHILDREN -- WE DO AN ANNUAL TOY SAFETY REPORT EVERY YEAR PASSED FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON TO GIVE PARENTS TIPS ABOUT WHAT'S ON STORE SHELVES THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERING -- WHEN THEY PURCHASE TOYS AND I'M FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS PAST YEAR WE INCLUDED INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES? I'M AND TOYS AS ONE OF THE KEY CATEGORIES THAT PARENTS SHOULD BE I'M JUST THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT BEFORE BRINGING THESE DEVICES INTO THEIR HOMES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY DO HAVE SECURITY FEATURES. I'M ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IS THAT THE FBI HAS ACTUALLY ISSUED A WARNING -- TO PARENTS TO CONSIDER SITE ACTED TOYS INTO THE HOME. YEAH AND I'M IN ADDITION TO THE MY FRANK HERE WHAT ALL. I WISH WE HAD OUR EVENT ARE BUT TO A SAFETY ABOUT LAST NOVEMBER THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF THE CLOUD PETS TEDDY BEAR -- AT ITS IS THE BEAR THAT WHERE PIC PARENTS AND KIDS CAN SEND MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER FROM FAR AWAY -- THROUGH MESSAGE RECORDINGS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE COMPANY WHO -- WAS AT A KEPT ALL THOSE MESSAGES IN EASY TO HACK DATABASE AND TWO MILLION RECORDINGS WERE FOUND ONLINE. I'M SO DID THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES FROM PIC FOR PARENTS TO CONSIDERING CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THIS IS NT AN ISSUE JUST LIMITED TO PARENTS AND KIDS. I'M I KNOW I WAS PERSONALLY COMPELLED BY ED FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES LAST SUNDAY ABOUT HOW INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES CAN BE USED IN DOMESTIC ABUSE ABUSE CASE SAYS. I'M AGAINST -- THAT VICTIMS AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT COMPANIES ARE PUTTING SECURITY FEATURES FIRST THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE IS A VERY SHE HIM PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE SENATOR JACKSON'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS EVENT ECHOED BY THE FBI AND OTHERS ABOUT THE SECURITY PARTICULARLY MOTOR VEHICLES WHICH THESE DAYS ARE BASICALLY COMPUTERS ON WHEELS. AND ESPECIALLY EASY BECOME INCREASINGLY AUTONOMOUS IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE SECURE. AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD PROBLEMS WITH PACKING FOR INTO ITS CHRYSLER -- HAD TO RECALL -- MANY OF ITS VEHICLES BECAUSE THERE WAS A FLAW THAT ALLOWED HACKERS TO REMOTELY CONTROL THEM. POSING IN ON PRESIDENT DANGER. FOR NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE DRIVE PASSENGERS AND OTHERS WHO SHARE THE ROADS. AND HACKERS COULD CUT THE BRAKES SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE DRIVER OFF THE ROAD OR MAKE ALL THE ELECTRONICS GO HAYWIRE. THERE ARE NO FEDERAL STANDARDS UNFORTUNATELY -- REGARDING MOTOR VEHICLE SEACM SECURITY SO IT'S UP TO THE STATES TO ACT ON THAT. AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FBI IS ONE THAT ECONOMIST CARS COULD BE USED AS LETHAL WEAPONS. AND THEY HAVE PREDICTED THAT IT THOMAS CARS WILL HAVE QUOTE A HIGH IMPACT ON TRANSFORMING WHAT BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ITS ADVERSARIES. CAN OPERATIONALLY TO WITH A CAR -- SO WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT AND I THINK ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GET WORSE. AND WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SELL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. PLEASE TELL US WHO YOU ARE AND THE ASSOCIATION OR COMPANY THAT YOU WITH. SITTING ATTACK OUR CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. HI -- FEELING GRIEVES WITH ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY A NEUTRAL ON THE BILL BUT WE JUST WANTED TO COME TO A BRIEF COMMENT. A CYBERSECURITY SLICK BAKED INTO ALL OF OUR PRODUCT DESIGNED THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE WE REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THESE ISSUES OUT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE FAT PROTEGER SHE'S TAKEN WEEKLY WORK CLOSELY WITH HER SO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN OPPOSITION. AT THIS TIME LOTSA ESTABLISH QUORUM. BROKAW PLACE NO MAN'S. CHAO HERE HIGHLY. BAKER HERE BERMAN THERE CALDERON [inaudible] GABRIEL [inaudible] IRWIN [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] REYES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME OPPOSITION -- ANYTIME YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M KEVIN MESSNER I'M WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS -- SO ONE TO GIVE A PERSPECTIVE FROM MANUFACTURERS BLACKS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE THESE PRODUCTS TO DEAL WITH AND WHICH DEAL WITH SMART APPLIANCES REFRIGERATORS. NUMBER SMART APPLIANCES THAT ARE OUT THERE -- AND THEN WERE HOPEFUL AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE TO TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR -- ON THIS IS WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT ON THE OBJECTIVE. WE WANT. THE HOME TO BE. A SECURE OR AND ANY WEEK WINKLE WEAK LINK AND THE HOME -- SOME FROM SOME OTHER PRODUCT BEING BROUGHT AND IS PROBLEMATIC SO WE WANT IT TO BE STRONG. OUR ISSUES ARE WITH THE WAY THE BILL AS DRAFTED NOW. IS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE CYBERSECURITY IS THROUGH. PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES THAT CHANGES THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES OF ALL -- BUT THAT CAN BE HANDLED BESTER NATIONAL CONSENSUS STANDARDS -- THERE THERE'S ONE OUT THERE NOW THERE'S YOU WELL TWENTY NINE HUNDRED THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY CANADA IT SETS OUT. RISK ANALYSIS AUTHENTICATION PROCEDURES. THAT'S HOW SECURITY IS DONE IT'S IT'S PROBLEMATIC WHEN IT'S THE A VAGUE REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURE THAT LAWYERS CAN ARGUE ABOUT AFTER. AND AND HINDSIGHT'S ALWAYS TWENTY TWENTY WITH SECURITY IF. WE'LL LOOK BACK JUST GET INTO THE BUILDING THIS MORNING I YOU SEE PEOPLE TAKE THEIR LAPTOPS OUT. THAT'S NOW. IT'S SITTARD REASONABLE SECURITY YOU TAKE OUT YOUR LAPTOP BEFORE THAT IT HAPPENED IT WASN'T REASONABLE SECURITY TAKE OUT YOUR LAPTOP BUT YOU COULD TO MANUFACTURE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT SANTA YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. AND SO HINDSIGHT'S ALWAYS. TWENTY TWENTY WE JUST DON'T WANNA BE SUBJECT THE MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING BY LAWYERS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE STRONG CYBERSECURITY AND WE THINK THAT WE CAN GET THERE IF YOU UTILIZE THE BASIS OF NATIONAL CONSENSUS STANDARDS. I CAN GET US THERE INSTEAD OF A VAGUE REASONABLE SECURITY. SO WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A STRONG. CYBERSECURITY BILL WE DON'T REALLY ONE A JOB SECURITY BILL FOR LAWYERS AND ENFORCEMENT FOLKS -- AND WE THINK WE CAN GET THERE NO WE THINK WE GET TECHNICAL FOLKS AND WE ALL ENDS NINE CENTER I THINK. ONE OF HI BIG WHAT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE GET EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. AND GET MANUFACTURES AND TO TALK ABOUT HOW THINGS SHOULD BE DESIGNED BASED ON PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES. NOT BASED ON JUST. REGIONAL SECURITY FEATURES SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATCH ANNEX WHEN HIS PLACE. I THINK THE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR -- BOTH SENATOR JACKSON AND IS A MEMBER IRWIN FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL SO FAR NOT MANY MISTRAL COOK A REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WHERE IT SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL POSITION ON THIS BILL AND THAT WE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN A POSITION -- BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH SENATOR JACKSON'S OFFICE -- AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN'S OFFICE STAFF YESTERDAY TO I DISCUSS OUR ISSUES -- AND THOSE COMPANIES WERE VERY PRODUCTIVE OUTS WERE HOPING TO CONTINUE BUT OUT WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE COMPANION BILL TO SB -- THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS AB NINETEEN OH SIX AND WE PER TO THIS COMMITTEE WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY HEARD -- AND BECAUSE THE BILLS HAVE IDENTICAL LANGUAGE WE HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES -- WITH THIS BILL FIRST -- IS WITH THE DEFINITION OF MANUFACTURER -- IT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES PEOPLE THAT IMPORT -- AND RESELL CONNECTED DEVICES UNDER THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABEL THIS IS AN ISSUE OF FOR EXAMPLE SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED A YOUNG MY CHINESE MANUFACTURER THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE COVERED BY THIS BILL. AYE BECAUSE THEY ARE A CHINESE MANUFACTURER AND THEY DO NOT SELL THEIR PRODUCTS TO END USERS THE ONLY WAY THAT THEIR PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET IS THROUGH THE WORK -- IMPORTERS -- THAT. IMPORTANT IS ALREADY EXISTING MANUFACTURED DEVICES THAT THEY DON'T CONTRACT FOR THE ALREADY SOURCE. THE IMPORT THEM TO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET THEY PUT THEIR PRIVATE LABEL ON THEM AND THEY RESULT. IN THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS OF AB NINETEEN A SIX A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE COMPANY TRENDNET IN THEIR SECURE VIEW CAMERAS -- THAT ISSUE IT'S IS CAUSED BY THOSE IMPORT AS A RESELLER SO AS LONG AS THE DEFINITION OF OF MANUFACTURE EXCLUDES THOSE PEOPLE WE CAN NEVER HAVE A TRULY CYBER -- SHE CYBERSECURITY BOTH GOING TO FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE SENATORS UNSECURE DEVICES ARE ON OUR NETWORKS -- ALL THE EFFORT THAT WE MAKE TO SECURE OUR DEVICES ARE MOOT AYE IT ALSO PLACES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE INCREASE THEIR MARKET SHARE -- OUR MANUFACTURERS THAT DO THINGS BY THESE CHEAPER UNSECURE DEVICES BUT THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE REASONABLENESS TEST WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD INCLUDE OR SHOULD BE TIED TO A BROADER -- NUMBER OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS ARE DEVELOPED BY TWO SECURITY ENTRY EXPERTS OR OTHER CREDITED BODIES THAT ADDRESS -- FORESEEABLE VULNERABILITIES RIGHT NOW THE BILL EXPRESSLY -- EXPERT MOVES LIABILITY OF COMPANIES ADOPT PASSWORDS BUT IF A COMPANY WERE TO ADOPT MORE SECURE MEANS THAT A PASSWORD IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD BE -- LIABLE UNDER THIS BILL NOT FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WE DO MORE THAN A PASSWORD OUT WE SHOULD. BE DEEMED REASONABLE SO UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED WE WE DON'T THINK THAT THE BILL SHOULD BE -- MOVED FORWARD BUT WE CAPITA CONVERSATION SO FAR WITH BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN OFFICE SENATOR JACKSON'S OFFICE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THESE ISSUES -- SO FOR IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION WE EXPECT OTHER WE WILL BE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED UNLESS IT'S A RESULT THAT. THANK YOU MATCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE -- BENJAMIN PALMER BEHALF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES GIVEN THERE'S EXISTING NHTSA GUIDANCE ON CYBERSECURITY. THE BILL DOES CONTAIN EGGS AND EXEMPTION FOR CONNECTED DIVIDE IS WHOSE DEVICES HOOFS FUNCTIONALITY IS SUBJECT TO GUIDANCE PROMULGATED BY FEDERAL AGENCY THIS APPEARS TO COVER OUR CIRCUMSTANCE BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK AND AMENDMENTS WITH THE OTHER. TWO RESOLVER CONCERTS. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SEEING NONE LET'S SUFFERING A BACK TO THE COMMUNITY QUESTIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE. TAKE MISTER CHAIRED A SENATOR I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN -- IT'S ALWAYS AWKWARD FOR US WHEN WE GOT TO BILLS A DEAL WITH A SIMILAR SUBJECT MATTER THE COME THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND OF THE TWO OF YOU COME UP WITH A VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM SO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING CARE OF THAT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BY THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT A REASONABLE SECURITY STANDARD IS. AND I AGREE THAT THE BILL LACKS A LOT OF SPECIFICITY IN THAT SENSE WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY REASONABLE. WELL -- THREESOME WE SAY REASONABLE INSTEAD OF PROSCRIBING ARE PRESCRIBING IS THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. AND IRONICALLY I USUALLY GET YOUR THIS IS TOO STRICT AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE EVERYTHING SO HE MADE IT NICE AND BROUGHT TO THE INDUSTRY CAN MAKE ITS OWN. DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT IS REASONABLE AND AND WE EXPECT IT WILL BE DONE IN GOOD FAITH AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY KEEP ARGUING NOBODY KNOWS THIS WORLD BETTER THAN WE DO. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY SHOWS NO THIS WORLD BETTER THAN ANYONE THEN TAKE THOSE REASONABLE STEPS BASED UPON THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION THAT YOUR PARTICULAR -- DEVICE -- GENERATES SO IT IS A IT IT ALLOWS INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH THOSE. A REASONABLE DOESN'T TAKE BEST PRACTICES IT'S HAS REASONABLE AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY BEST PRACTICES -- THERE'S ALWAYS A CONCERN ABOUT LITIGATION BUT OF THIS BILL GIVES THOSE POWERS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF YOU KNOW LAWYERS COMING IN SECOND GUESSING THAT'S AYE I KNOW THAT'S SORT OF A BUZZWORD BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S WHAT'S. WHAT OF THE REASONABLE APPROACHES TAKEN GIVEN THE PERIOD OF TIME AND WIN WITHIN WHICH THOSE? EFFORTS ARE MADE AS THINGS CHANGE AND AS THEY ARE DOING ON A DAILY BASIS YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT. THE AT&amp;T ASSAULTS ARE ARE ON YOUR EQUIPMENT WHERE YOU'RE VULNERABILITIES. AND ADDRESS THEM IN THAT FASHION SO -- THERE IS FLEXIBILITY HERE SO THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN ADAPT BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE MOVING SO RATHER THAN HAVE IT SET. SO THAT YOU FIX IT IS A POINT IN TIME. THE INDUSTRY WILL KNOW THAT AS THE CYBER ATTACKS AND AND THE THE KIND OF THE CREATIVITY OF OF THOSE WHO WANTED TO HARM TO THE SYSTEMS ARE ONE OF VIOLATE PRIVACY AND WANT TO TAKE OVER THE GRID AND WANT TO TAKE OVER -- AUTOMOBILES IT'S ETRE THAT THE THAT THE COMPANIES TO MANUFACTURERS WILL ACTUALLY. BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND TAKE THOSE REASONABLE STEPS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE AS THIS WHOLE CSUS SITUATION WHICH IS SO FLUID -- CONTINUES TO ADVANCE LEAVING IT UP TO THE INDUSTRY. TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS WHAT THEY DEFINE AS REASONABLE STEPS AND AGAIN WE HAVE A WE WE HAVE A IDENTIFIED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS SHE APPROPRIATE AGENCY I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GOING TO BRING LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS TEN YEARS. OLD ARE YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT THE SITUATION AS IT EXISTS AT THE POINT IN TIME. WHEN THE -- NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR TOOK PLACE THAT UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY IN THE SECURITY IN THE PRIVACY OF THE SYSTEM [inaudible] OKAY SO. I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF THE CRUX OF MY A LACK OF COMFORT WITH. THE DEFINITION OF REASONABLE ON THE BILL BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THE TECH INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY YEARS NOW. AND ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON CONNECTED DEVICES I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT REASONABLE MEANS SO WHEN YOU SAY REASONABLE TO ME THAT I'M MAKING A CONNECTED DEVICE -- I THINK ABOUT OKAY PASSWORDS GREAT YOU ADDRESS THAT WHAT ABOUT ENCRYPTION DEVICE STORE USER DATA ON THIS DEVICE IN MY REQUIRED TO ENCRYPTED. THAT'S POSSIBLE TO ENCRYPT THIS IS A REASONABLE TO ENCRYPT IT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M IF I'M REQUIRED TO ENCRYPTED WHAT STANDARD MY REQUIRED TO ENCRYPTED WITH. I IT'S NOT UNCOMMON. IF I'M ENCRYPTING USER DATA TO BE TO USE THE PASSWORD THAT'S BEEN ENTERED FOR THE DEVICE AS TO THE POPE THE KEY FOR THE PRIVATE KEY FOR ENCRYPTING. THE DATA ON THAT DEVICE AYE YOU HAPPEN TO FIND ANY. ANNE -- LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG IT HAS TO BE YOUR MONEY. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHARACTERS IT HAS TO HAVE SO I MEAN I'M JUST I'M NOT. I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR HIM JUST SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT IF I'M MAKING A CONNECTED DEVICE I NEED TO KNOW THAT STUFF. AND I I HAD THE UNUSUAL. THE EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR OF READING EIGHT COURT TRANSCRIPT OF A ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS ARGUING ABOUT A BILL THAT I HAD PASSED TWO YEARS BEFORE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR WILL THE AUTHOR CLEARLY INTENDED TO DO THERE'S NO WE DIDN'T? AND I'M THINKING I'M THE AUTHOR YOU COULD ASK ME IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY INTENT WAS PUT ARE MADE IT ILLUSTRATES THE POINT THAT WHAT WE DO HERE REALLY MATTERS THE WORDS WE USE IN THE BILL. REALLY MATTER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ARGUE ABOUT IT AND I WOULD JUST IF IF WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THIS KIND OF SECURITY. FOR CONNECTED DEVICES I THINK WE OWE IT TO EVERYBODY. TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE REQUIRING CANNOT JUST LEAVE IT OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THE PROBLEM IS AT IF WE FIX WHAT IT IS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO IN TWO WEEKS THE OF THE THE ENTIRE TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE SHIFTED. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS GIVING THE THE INDUSTRY WHICH KNOWS AND KNOWS BEST HOW TO PROTECT. THE INFORMATION TO OUR USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO PROTECT THE INFORMATION. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SAYING LOOK FOLKS. THERE ARE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROTECT THIS INFORMATION YOU USE WHATEVER REASONABLE TECHNIQUES YOU HAVE TO DO THAT [inaudible] AND AGAIN IF A PASSWORD IS LOCATED DAY IN TWO WEEKS A PASSWORD WON'T BE THE ANSWER AND BUT NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW THEY'RE BETTER THAN THE INDUSTRY SO -- ARE I'M YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT OF REDIFF OR OR NARROWING OR SPEED BEING MORE SPECIFIC WITH THE DEFINITIONS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST. THAT THE MANUFACTURERS KNOW NOW WHAT [inaudible] THE PUBLIC. ISN'T LIKELY TO KNOW FOR AWHILE BECAUSE THEY ARE AT THE CUTTING EDGE AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT THAT INFORMATION. AND GIVING THEM A WIDE BERTH -- MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM AND THEIR CREATIVE -- KNOWLEDGE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO -- AGAIN YES YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SAY IF YOU GET TO LAWYERS A ROOM YOU GET FOUR OPINIONS BUT AT IT YOU KNOW THAT. A AGAIN WE'RE LEAVING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE EXACTLY -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY OUR NEW COLLEAGUE HERE I'M RECOVERING MYSELF ON THE PROFESSION SO -- OF IT AS I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE BUT THE THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT THE INDUSTRY TO BE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THIS NOT TO BE PRO SCRIPTED. AS TO WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT TO BE ABLE TO BE INVENTIVE AND CREATIVE IN WHAT THEY CAN DO BECAUSE THEY KNOW BETTER NINETY ONE WHAT'S DOWN THE ROAD WHAT'S COMING IF I COULD MAKE A SUGGESTION. SURE I THINK THAT ONE OF THE POINTS THE OPPOSITION RAISED WAS AN EXCELLENT ONE WHICH IS THAT IF. IF WORKING FOR A WITH WE WANT TO BE SPECIFIC. ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN BY REASONABLE THEM THEIR WAYS TO DO THAT WE PICK AN INDUSTRY STANDARD AND THAT STANDARD IS MAINTAINED BY INDUSTRY. AND AS EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITY CHANGE OVER TIME THE STANDARDS CHANGE OVER TIME YOU REFERENCE THAT STANDARD YOU SUCK A LOOK THAT'S THE BASELINE YOU HAVE TO DO AT LEAST. AS GOOD AS THAT AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IT'S A WAY THAT WE'VE SEEN HAVE PROBLEMS ALL THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE MOVED. THROUGH HERE SO -- BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN ALL RESPECT TODAY BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU MOVING FORWARD AS YOU TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT THAT'S A REALLY ELEGANT SOLUTION. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WORK WERE BEING DEFINITIVE. AYE AND SPECIFIC ABOUT WERE REQUIRING WHEN WE PUT THIS KIND OF REGULATION ON INDUSTRY. WELL LET ME JUST SUGGEST YOU THAT THIS IS THE SAME STANDARD THE SAME STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS THAT HAS WORKED IN CALIFORNIA'S DATA BREACH BILL. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SO BASICALLY WE ARE USING A SYSTEM AND A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE AND BEEN AFFECTED FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE PUT A REQUIREMENT OUT THERE THE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WEIGHT IS WERE RIGHT OR THANK YOU FOR THE DIALOGUE THANK YOU AND AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CAP GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE THIS HAS BEEN IN PLACE. WITH THE OF THE DATA BREACH PROVISIONS STAT THE INDUSTRY KNOWS. A AND THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO APPLY USING THAT TERMINOLOGY BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT AND LETS GO TO MISS REYES FOLLOWED BY HIS BAKER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT SENATOR I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I APPRECIATE TWO THINGS ALSO MOST ESPECIALLY ONE IS YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN. IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD TOGETHER AND THE OTHER IS IN LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION. IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'VE HAD DIALOGUE WITH THEM THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE DIALOGUE CONTINUES. AND THAT'S ALWAYS SO IMPORTANT IN TRYING TO REACH AS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR HAS TALKED ABOUT. HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO FINALLY GET TO THE END RESULT APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR IN PUT IN ALL OF YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THIS. WITH OPPOSITION AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS THANK YOU APPRECIATED PASSED BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATOR I I SUPPORTED ARE GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM VENN TOURISTS BILL -- BEFORE THEY DID RAISE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THEM MISTER OBERNOLTE HAS ARTICULATED THAT WHILE I THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS. YES OTHER REASONABLE STANDARD FULLY RECOVERED ATTORNEY AT AYE I MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS YEAR SPLIT. OF THEIR REASONABLE THE STANDARD HAS ITS PROS AND CONS BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS YOU DON'T GET TO LIST IT SO FACT INTENSIVE YOU DON'T GET TO ESTABLISH IT UNTIL YOU'RE IN A COURT. WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND WHILE WE WANT INDUSTRY TO BE AS YOU SAY RIGHTLY SO. APPRECIATE HEARING IT -- INNOVATIVE AND CREATING ITS WEEK THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF STANDARD THAT CAN ALSO COMPLETELY IMPAIR THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SUFFICIENT SO. I EYEING WHO'S ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT VISITING WITH A FURTHER WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THAT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A NATIONAL STANDARD YOU CAN EAT YOU CAN POINT TO IT -- IF YOU SAY REASONABLE S. YOU KNOW INCLUDING I'M GOING TO TRY TO MEND YOUR BILL HERE INCLUDING NATIONAL STANDARDS YOU YOU MAY. BE GIVING GUIDANCE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEYOND WE JUST WANT YOU TO GO DO THIS AND THAT IT'S IT'S ONE POTENTIAL PLACE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SAFE HARBOR THAT IS. ONE THAT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD I I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT BUT I ALSO AM HATE EXPRESSED CONCERN. IN THE PAST AND WANT TO AGAIN ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING DEFINITION. BECAUSE WE ARE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY -- FOR READING THIS. LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT WILL ONLY APPLY TO DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED PRODUCTS AND LEAVE. THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET OUT WHICH IS NOT ONLY A LOOPHOLE THAT DISADVANTAGES ARE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND EMPLOYEES SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT PARTICULAR SHOW ABSOLUTELY. THE DEFINITION OF MANUFACTURER AND IT IS SOFT -- IN THE BILL ITSELF UNDER. OF SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT NINETY ONE POINT O. TO SEE. MANUFACTURER MEANS THE PERSON WHO MANUFACTURERS OR CONTRACTS WITH ANOTHER PERSON TO MANUFACTURE. THAT SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLKS FROM CHINA. BECAUSE WE THEN CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER PERSON. WHO MANUFACTURES ON THAT PERSON'S BEHALF CONNECTED DEVICES THAT ARE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA? THAT SO I I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE VIEW THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING FOREIGN COMPANIES THEY A CONTRACT. TO MANUFACTURE AND THEY WOULD BE INCLUDED. AND THE LONG ARM STATUTE CALIFORNIA WOULD ALSO GET THEM ANYWAY. BUT IT DOES SPECIFICALLY SAY -- CONTRACT TO MANUFACTURE SO IT WOULD INCLUDE ALL FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING THESE DEVICES. BRING THEM TO THE UNITED STATES ARM OF WHETHER IT'S UNDER THERE THEIR NAME OR THE NAME OF AN AMERICAN COMPANY THEY STILL ARE INCLUDED UNDER THIS PROVISION. THANK YOU IF I MAY. THREE IS THE CHAIR IF I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THANK YOU MAY ASK THEIR OPPOSITION IS YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT LANGUAGE IS WELL. IN ADVANCE YOU INTO TOO MUCH OF A DEBATE BUT I I'VE THIS CONCERNS ME SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD FIND OUT WHERE WHERE'S THE HOLE IN THAT FROM. SO IT WOULD BE THAT THE NEXT PART OF THAT DEFINITION WORD IT SAYS THE FOLKS THAT ARE. CREATE AKON TRACK TO PURCHASE EXISTING GOODS ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION MANUFACTURER SO THE LOOPHOLE THAT IT CREATES BETWEEN LIKE A COMPANY LIKE JOHN BY IN A COMPANY LIKE TREND THAT. IS THAT A CHINESE MANUFACTURED THE DOESN'T AUTHORIZE ANYTHING FOR SALE OUTSIDE OF CHINA A CREATES A BUNCH OF SAY WEBCAMS. IN CHINA -- THEN A COMPANY THAT ESTABLISHES ITSELF IN CALIFORNIA BEEN FINDS THOSE DEVICES THAT EXISTS AND CREATES A CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE WAS WHICH IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THE BILL -- TO IMPORT THOSE DEVICES INTO AMERICA THEY PUT THEIR LABEL ON THE MISS TRAINING THAT THEY SELL THEM TO OUR MARKETPLACE SO. THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES IS WHAT CREATES THE LOOPHOLE THANK YOU AND IF IT SINCE IT SOUNDS CENTER YOU AGREE IN THE IDEA YOU WANT MAKE SURE GETS ABSOLUTE -- IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER CONVERSATIONS TO FINE TUNE THAT I HOPE YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT -- BECAUSE I I I I HOPE WE CAN -- THE FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF INADVERTENTLY HAVE A LOOPHOLE THAT WE KNOW. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION WILL FIND A WAY AND WHERE DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS AND RIGHT I'VE. ONE ADDITIONAL ONE AND THAT IS THAT ALSO. THE CONCEPT OF HINDSIGHT SO SOMEBODY BUYS A REFRIGERATOR YEAH I'M I GOT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD REFRIGERATOR IN MY HOUSE. AND WHAT CONTINUING DUTY THERE IS AFTER I'VE PURCHASED. A SOMETHING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND WITH OF WHAT WAS AT THE TIME WHAT CONTINUING DUTY MIGHT REMAINS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS LIABILITY. WELL THE WAY THIS BILL IS OF WRITTEN. THE THE QUESTION THE MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSIBILITY. ARM IN TERMS OF SECURITY IS AT THE POINT THAT THE THAT THE DEVICE WAS PURCHASED. WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THAT THEY ANTICIPATE FIFTEEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. ABOUT WHAT'S SECURING WHAT ISN'T SECURE -- FIFTEEN YEARS LATER. SO IT'S JUST IT NOW IF. TRYING TO THINK OF A REFRIGERATOR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK IT'S THEY WERE VERY AS YOU ARE THEY JUST KEPT THINGS CLEARLY HANG ON YEAH YEAH YEAH -- SO YEAH I MEAN THEY DID THE JOB THAT I THINK WE EXPECTED WHICH WAS TO KEEP THE BEER COLD AND THE ICE FROZEN -- IT TODAY OF COURSE THEY DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND SO IF YOU WERE TO BUY ONE TODAY THE NEXT WHEN YOU BUY TODAY UNDER THIS BILL. IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE SECURITY PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY I THAT ARE KNOWN TO THE MANUFACTURER. IN AND YOU KNOW THAT THING THAT THAT THEY KNOW ARE ARE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS TODAY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANY. MR WENT GO AHEAD PRESS THANK YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE A OF WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BILL AND ARE -- THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I I'M SORRY THAT I WALKED IN A LITTLE LATE SO I DON'T REMEMBER I DON'T KNOW IF ALL THIS WAS MENTIONED BUT AS FAR AS AND THERE IS IN THE BILL IF THERE ARE FEDERAL STANDARDS SO. YOU HEARD I I HOPE THAT DIVIDE. MANUFACTURERS IF THERE ARE FEDERAL STANDARDS YOU ARE EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL. A THE SECOND THING IS WHEN WE HEARD THIS IN PRIVACY THE MANUFACTURERS DID EXPLAIN. OR EXPRESS IT AND CONCERNED ABOUT TO ADD THIS DISADVANTAGING CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WE DID CHANGE THE LANGUAGE AFTER PRIVACY -- TO TO REALLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND IF IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WILL LOOK AT IT SOME MORE BUT CERTAINLY THAT WAS THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION TO DISADVANTAGE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND AND I WILL REITERATE AGAIN -- LIKE I DID AND PRIVACY AND IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL SINCE. LAST FALL AND IT HAS GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE MULTIPLE -- AND I HAVE VERSIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF GROUPS LIKE THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION CAL CHAMBER -- TECHNET AND MOST OF MOST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL OF THEM EXCEPT -- FOR THE MANUFACTURERS ARE EITHER NEUTRAL OR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SO AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY TRY TO MAKE THIS A VERY VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND AGAIN -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT IN MY OPINION THAT WE PASSED SOMETHING THAT STARTS TO AT LEAST REGULATE SOME OF THESE AYE OTA DEVICES BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN -- WITHOUT REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEMS AND TO WHOM WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT THE BIG -- TAKEOVER OF DYING WARY YOU'RE BRINGING DOWN PART OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE APPROPRIATE SO I'M SECURITY ON THESE AYE OF TWO DEVICES I THINK THIS IS NOT A HUGE STEP THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I'M. DEATHLY IN SUPPORT OF AND WHAT THE SENATE DOING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- THE LAST FEW HOLD OUTS BUT AGAIN IF THEY WANT A FEDERAL STANDARD THEY WOULD BE EXEMPTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND THE SENATOR AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS -- THIS LEGISLATION MOVING FORWARD I DID JUST. FOR MY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR I THINK -- YA I CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT A THAT A MANUFACTURER IS GOING TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEY'RE GONNA KNOW THEIR TECHNOLOGY. BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE THEY'RE GONNA SASS LITIGATION RISK REPUTATIONAL RISK LOOK AT WHAT OTHER FOLKS INDUSTRIES ARE DOING AND THEN MAKE A REASONED DETERMINATION. AND I SUSPECT ALSO THAT THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ANY OTHER ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE STANDARD THAT THEY'VE EMPLOYED BUT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- IF WE FIND OUT THAT THAT STANDARD IS UNWORKABLE FOR SOME REASON OR IS CAUSING A LOT OF CHALLENGES ARE STIFLING INNOVATION THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME BACK AND CORRECT THIS LEGISLATION IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE THE AUTHOR AND AND AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM ON THOUSAND OAKS HAVE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THEIR APPROACH HERE THAT THEY'VE TALKED WITH FOLKS IN INDUSTRY SO. IT SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE SENSE TO MOVE FORWARD TO CHECK TO MAKE PROGRESS IF THERE ARE LITTLE TWEAKS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK AND DO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS. LEGISLATION FORWARD I REMEMBER JUST A FEW YEARS AGO MY SELECT COMMITTEE HAD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; --&lt;/c&gt;</u> WORKSHOP ON IOTV INTO -- AT THE UC BERKELEY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT KEPT COMING UP WAS. THE OF THE THEORY OF OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY DESIGN AND ON DODD IS THE CONCEPT THOUGH WHEREBY ON THESE PRIVACY AS WELL AS SECURITY ISSUES WERE CONSIDER AT THE GET GO FROM THE DESIGN PHASE. AND OTHER BUT THIS BILL AS WELL AS A NINETEEN OH SIX ARE YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE THAT CONCEPT IN MIND AND I THINK GO WHEN WE PASSED THE BILL I THINK WE'LL. HAVE LA TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE ON THE ON THE UC DESIGN PHASE ON ON MANY OF THESE DEVICES SO I I I I YOU KNOW TREMENDOUSLY I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I MISS IRWIN. FOR A WORKING ON THIS ON THIS SO LEGISLATION AS WELL AS A RECOGNIZE RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL CYBER THREATS UP OPPOSED BY THESE -- DEVICES AND ALSO ONE OF COMMAND TO BOTH OF YOU ARE ON A RECONCILING YOUR LANGUAGES AS WELL AS WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW IT'S BEEN ARE YOU DON'T HAVE A LONG PROCESS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. AND THEM SO WITH THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU TO CLOSE OUR AND IN OUR LAST -- FOR A MOTION TO MOVE YOUR BILL. FOR YES AND I WANNA <u>&lt;c.green&gt; THANK&lt;/c&gt;</u> ALL MEMBERS WHO GOOD DISCUSSION -- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS HERE NO ONE'S TRYING TO DO A GOTCHA. WITH. IT'S NEED THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS A AGAINST THINGS LIKE -- HACKING THAT WE'VE HAD NOT ARE NINE ELEVEN SYSTEMS CONSTANTLY BEING HACKED PIECE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE AS THE PUBLIC RELY UPON. FOR FOR SAFETY TO GET IMMEDIATE RESPONSES IN INFREQUENTLY LIFE THREATENING IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. THEY THERE'S BEEN HACKING OF OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE OR NAT A NATURAL GAS PIPELINE SYSTEMS THESE HAVE ALL BEEN HACKED. YOU KNOW THEIR PEOPLE -- PAUL ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO. WISH TO DO US HARM AND WHO HAVE NOTHING THEIR TASK THEY'RE PAID BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS OR THEIR THESE OF THE THUGS WHO IF YOU WILL THESE GANG CENTER OUT THERE. ATTACKING ARE VERY VULNERABLE -- SYSTEMS AND THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE GOAL HERE IS TO REAFFIRM THE RIGHT THE THE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. AS YOU SAY STARTING IN THE DESIGN CONCEPT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE CREATIVITY OF THE HIT AND CAN THE HUMAN MIND IS REALLY UNLIMITED BOTH FOR GOOD AND FOR EVIL. AND SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS POLICY MAKERS ARE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS COMPANIES WHO HAVE THAT. A AUGUST RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE GOALS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO EVERYONE. US SO I I WAS STRUCK BY THE NOTION THAT COMPANIES WILL EVALUATE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE REPUTATIONAL AND LITIGATION RISKS THIS IS SORT OF THIS THIS LEGISLATION THIS EFFORT. IS TO PUT EVERYBODY IN A POSITIVE POSITION SO THAT THEY THEIR OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS. ARE BEING PROTECTED THAT THE MANUFACTURERS ARE IN THE FOREFRONT TO NAFTA WHICH REPUTATION WE I THINK IT'S AN ADVANTAGE WHEN. WHEN WORSE ALL AFRAID 90% THE PUBLIC IS OF AFRAID OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PRODUCTS? IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S BEST INTEREST UP TO PASS LEGISLATION LIKE THIS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS I THINK CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD IN A WORLD THAT WE YET DO NOT KNOW.

FOR THE PARENT OF ACTION YOU CANNOT HAVE A PART RIGHT OF ACTION IF THERE'S A SECURITY -- REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES AND IN YOUR HAIR DATA MANAGEMENT -- SO THAT SAME DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAVE WHAT IS REASONABLE SECURITY SO I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE FLUSHED OUT THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT THE MAIN THING SO MISTER CHAO. WHEN YOUR BILL PASSED AB THREE SEVEN FIVE WE SENT YOU A LIST OF ISSUES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSABLE JUST READ OF REDO THAT LETTER MAY BE SENT? TO THE SENATOR HERE TO SENATOR DODD BUT ONE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES REASONABLE SECURITY AND THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE SEEN NO OTHER OPPOSITION LENNY'S LET ME TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOUR FOR THOUGHT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND VOLUNTEERING HIS SIR S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE TO BE THE VEHICLE. ARMED FOR THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL CLEAN UP BY TWO AB THREE SEVENTIES. FIVE ARE AS WE KNOW DE ABBREVIATED AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAD TO GET AB THREE SEVEN FIVE SIGNED INTO LAW. A REALLY RESULTED IN THE NUMBER OF DRAFTING IN TECHNICAL ERRORS. ALL IN I'M VERY HAPPY THAT THERE IS NOW AT A VEHICLE ARE DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THE ERROR STAT MOST IMMEDIATELY REQUIRE CORRECTION. ALL DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO WE CAN TURN TO MORE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. IN ANOTHER CLEAN UP BILL FOR NEXT YEAR. NOW WITH THAT BEING SAID THIS VEHICLE IS ALSO INTENDED TO DRAW CERTAIN COMMITMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MYSELF SENATOR. IT'S BURKE AS WELL AS SENATOR DIED DURING THE PASSAGE OF A THREE SEVENTY FIVE RELATING TO THREE PARTICULAR ISSUES FIRST A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND A SECOND PROTECTED DUNLUCE GATHERING ACTIVITIES. AND A TECHNICAL CLEANUPS ENVISIONED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE NOT WHO OF THESE ITEMS ARE CURRENTLY REFLECTED IN THE AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OUR FIRST THERE'S LANGUAGE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER. THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS LIMITED TO ONLY THE DATA BREACH PROVISION OF THE NEW LAW AS WE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE TARA FOCUSED TODAY. AS YOU YOU MAY RECALL WE ALSO DISCUSSED AS LIMITATION AT EVERY SINGLE HEARING. ARE DURING THE PASSAGE OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE LAST WEEK. AND WE MADE A PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION DOES NOT APPLY. A MORE BROADLY THAN ORIGINALLY INTENDED. SO THEREFORE TOGETHER WITH THE EXISTING LANGUAGE IN THE NEW LAW ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WILL APPLY ONLY TO THE DATA BREACH PROVISION. ARM. AND ANY OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT MIGHT EXIST UNDER OTHER LAWS WILL REMAIN UNAFFECTED ARE BY THIS LIMITATION. NOW THAT BEING SAID THE AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS IS A PLACE HOLDER ME UNDERSCORE THAT. INTENDED TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW MUCH ASSURANCES SHOULD BE MADE. IN STATUE. AS THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE CONSIDER FEEDBACK ON HOW TO BEST ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULT. SECONDLY THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHER NEW -- ASSOCIATION EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THREE SEVEN FIVE COULD INFRINGE ON FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED NEWS GATHERING ACTIVITIES AGAIN AS WE TESTIFIED DURING THE PASSAGE OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE LOSES THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE INTEDED AS WE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN THAT BILL. TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW DIDN'T AFFECT [inaudible] JOURNALISM. SO ACCORDINGLY THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDE A CARVE OUT FOR THOSE -- FOOD FOR THESE PROTECTED NEW SCATTERING ACTIVITIES. SIMILAR TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AMENDMENT THIS LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO FUNCTION AGAIN AS A PLACE HOLDER. WHILE INTERESTED PARTIES PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE ON HOW TO BEST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AVOID ON INTO THE CONSEQUENCES [inaudible] SO FINALLY. SINCE RELEASING THE MOCK UPS SET OF AMENDMENTS THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CHANGE. FROM THEIR WORK TERM EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION TO AFFIRMATIVE AUTHORIZATION QUOTE UNQUOTE. IN SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT ONE POINT. ONE TWENTY NOW THE PURPOSE OF THAT FOR THAT AMENDMENT IS TO BRING CONSISTENCY TO THE SECTION ABOUT MINORS OPTING IN. TO THE SALE OF INFORMATION AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AFFIRMATIVE AUTHORIZATION WAS ALWAYS OUR INTEND. FOR THE OFTEN REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER GIVEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT POLITICAL THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT HAS GENERATED DAHLE WE WILL REFRAIN FROM MAKING GOT AMENDMENT AT THIS TIME. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A OF DIALOGUE ABOUT IT AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. ARE THE INTENT AGAIN IS TO HAVE THIS CLEAN UP BILL THAT'S SOME THAT'S A TECHNICAL AND ARE. OF A PLACE HOLDER AS WELL AS NON CONTROVERSIAL. SO WITH THAT SAID I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR THESE AMENDMENTS AND I ASK THAT I BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. ARE AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON REFINING THIS IMPORTANT ON YOUR LAW. SO WITH THAT -- I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS BAKER. OKAY MISS ORINDA HAS I THINK THAT ALL THE SPEAKERS OF SAID IT VERY WELL IT DID IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON NOBODY IS COMPLETELY HAPPY BECAUSE THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY. POINTS SHORT TIMEFRAME A VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BUT I I THINK OF I REALLY WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAU SENATOR DODD AND HURTS BERG. FOR AG GETTING THIS ISSUE OFF THE BALLOT BECAUSE THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS THAT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WE CORRECT THE DRAFTING ISSUES IN THE TECHNICAL ISSUES AND YOU ADDRESS THE PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY THAT CAN REALLY CHANGE. HOW WE DO IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND ADDRESS THEM GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH? THANK YOU MISS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST A TWO THINGS AND ONE IS. ILL WHAT'S GOING TO BE TALKED ABOUT. WE JUST HEARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER RECESS WILL THIS BLESSED YOU. WELL THIS COMMITTEE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. NOT THAT I'M LOOKING FOR EXTRA COMMITTEE HEARINGS I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE FUN WHEN NECESSARY BUT TO TO HEAR THE AGAIN BECAUSE A LOT IS ON THAT LIST OF THINGS TO FIX BEYOND THE MINOR TECHNICAL. AND THERE WILL BE LANGUAGE TO SEE THE IMPACT TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES THEREFORE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALLY -- I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD DIRECTED TO THE CHAIR OF THE THE AUTHOR BUT I I WOULD THAT'S ONE QUESTION I HAVE A RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HEAR THIS AGAIN. AFTER SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE MADE AND THE SECOND IS ONE OF THE ITEMS I REMEMBER FROM INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- THAT I ATTENDED ON THE ORIGINAL BILL. UP I HAD SUGGESTED THAT. THERE IS A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BUT THAT THERE BE A HEARING. IN THIS BODY. BOB FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. SO AND I DIDN'T HEAR THAT ON THE LIST OF ITEMS THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT I APPRECIATED THE AUTHORS -- COMMITMENT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT I HOPE THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE ITEMS YOU MAY ADD TO YOUR LIST. SO THAT BEFORE IT BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENS. WE ARE ABLE TO SAY IS THIS ARE NOW THE PATH WE REALLY WANT TO GO DOWN AND I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS THE HEARING. TO SAY THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SO I I'M OFFER THOSE TWO POINTS. FOR CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE THAT ONE OR BOTH OF YOU MIGHT ADDRESS THEM THANKS. WELL IN THE FIRST. SINCE I'VE BEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND I'M ASKING YUBA OUGHT WILL DEFER TO THE CHAIR ON THAT.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ARE AND MISCELLANEOUS GO HEAD. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE VEHICLE IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE HAVE TO BE TECHNICAL CLEAR A CLEAN UP. AND THIS NEEDED TO HAPPEN -- I I THINK BY GETTING IT OUT BY TODAY THAN YOU HAVE.

SO THIS WAS PART OF IF BOB HERTZBERG A WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE A S. B. EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT YEAH ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. LONG TIME NO SEE HAVE SLOWLY RIGHT. HE THIS IS A THIRTY EIGHT A TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. YES THANK YOU. JUST VERY BRIEFLY ARE I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS WAS CHAIRED. IT'S COMMITTEE CERTAINLY SEEMS A SO AND SO OBERNOLTE IS AN EXPERT SO MUCH OF THIS. LOOK WE WOULD THE WORLD IS CHANGING AT A AT A BREAKNECK SPEED. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND GOVERNMENT IS WE JUST DON'T HARMONIZE WITH EACH THAT CHANGE WE'RE REACTIVE ORGANIZATION. BUT IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE TOP OF THE FOOT CENTEX TOP FIFTY COMPANIES ELEVEN OF THOSE. UNDER FORBES' LIST ARE BLOCKCHAIN COMPANIES. THEN WE GENERALLY LOOK AT BLOCKCHAIN IN WE HEAR THE TERM AND WE ONLY ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE IDEA. OF OF OF BUT A BIT COINS AND IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL. ITS AWAY TO REORGANIZE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH THE INTERNET. WHAT DOES THE INTERNET IT IN THIS PROVIDE EXPLOSIVELY VALUABLE? AT THAT ASPECTS TO OUR LIVES ALL ACROSS THE WORLD PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES THAT COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO STUFF. HAVE SWITCHED UNBELIEVABLE AND CERTAINLY THIS COMMITTEE JUST OUT WITH THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY SHORN THE CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY THE INTERNET. BUT IN ADDITION TO THE PRIVACY ISSUE WITH THE UNDERLYING ISSUE SECURITY. WHAT THE BLOCKCHAIN DOES IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY IT'LL IT BASICALLY WILL BE ORGANIZES HOW THE INTERNET INFORMATION? ARE IS IS IS BE ACCESS SINCE IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS IF YOU HAVE A BLOCK OF INFORMATION EACH BLOCK OF INFORMATION IS STAMPED IN TIME. WITH UNIQUE TIME STAMP EACH JUST PARTICULARLY STAMP OF THAT PARTICULAR CODE. AND THEN EACH TASK IS TO IS CODED TO THE PIECE OF INFORMATION BEFORE. AND AFTER IT. SO IT'S I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW I THINK SOMEHOW IN THE FUTURE. BUT IT CERTAINLY PROVIDES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF SECURITY THAT WE DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE. SECOND IS STILL OUT THERE BUT I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO LIVE ON THE MOON ONCE IN AWHILE -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG STEP FORWARD TOWARD [inaudible] DEMOCRATIZATION ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE INTERNET WHAT'S HAPPENED THE INTERNET HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SO MUCH MONEY. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WATCH BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTROLLING THE ADVERTISING A CONTROLLING IS A UNITED BALLS. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN'T GET A PIECE OF THAT. SO I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH BLOCKCHAIN THE NOTION IS CALLED TOKENIZATION BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET PAID FOR DISLIKING IT REWARDS POINTS FOR USING YOUR CREDIT CARD OR MILEAGE A SUBJECT THAT. YOU CAN SEE A SIMILAR SYSTEM IS STARTING TO HAPPEN AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. SO WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH THIS BILL. TRYING TO INTRODUCE THIS VERY COMPLEX CONCEPT INTO GOVERNMENT. I TRIED TO INTRODUCE IT WITH A LIKE THAT YOU WITH WITH TITLE. A I MET WITH AMBASSADOR TO VANUATU AND HE'S DOING ALL THIS TITLE ON BLOCKCHAIN. BUT HERE WE'VE GOT INTEREST ENTRENCHED INTERESTS AND IS NO WAY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA KILL OFF THE TITLE INSURANCE COMPANIES IF WE DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED A TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY PAY FOR INSURANCE. I TRIED TO DO IT WOULD DRIVERS LICENSES AND BIRTH CERTIFICATES BUT I GOT ALL THE BLOWBACK FROM GOVERNMENT TELLING ME HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO BE. SO HOW DO I STICK MY TOE IN THE WATER ON BLOCKCHAIN TO BEGIN THE INTERVIEWS IN THE CONVERSATION IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND SO WHAT I DID IN THIS BILL WAS ALLOW. COMPANIES TO ARE ON THEIR PRIVATE COMPANIES TO ORGANIZE THEIR THEIR STOCK LEDGERS WITH A BLOCKCHAIN. PRETTY SMALL DEAL THE WISE AND IMPORTANT AND ADD THE HOW DOES THAT HAVE AN ACTUAL GOVERNMENT PURPOSE TODAY I GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES ARE CLOSE. COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD THE TREASURER'S OFFICE HAD A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY. HAD SOME BOND MONEY IN SAN FRANCISCO I CAN'T RECALL THE SPECIFICS IS PROBABLY IN MY NOTES BUT AND WE LOOK AT MY NOTES VERY OFTEN. BUT BASICALLY SAYS THAT RIPPED OFF A SOME DUMB DEAL BY FOR BY FORMING A PARALLEL ACCOUNT. FOR THOSE WHO NO WHO WHO BEEN LAWYERS YOU KNOW WHO'VE BEEN BUSINESS KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OPEN THE COUNT IT'S ASSUME YOU'VE GOT. AT CHAO INCORPORATED COMPANY AS ALL SOMEBODY AND YOU GOT TWENTY CHECKS COMING IN A DAY IF SOMEBODY'S TWENTY ROOM PLOYS WANTS TO RIP YOU OFF. THEY SIMPLY TAKE THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO THE A A UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT OR RESOLUTION SAYING YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SAY HAVE HERTZBERG SIGN IN THE ACCOUNT I OPEN UP A PARALLEL ACCOUNT. AND THEN I TAKE A STEEL CHECKS FROM THE A CHAO COMPANY AND I PUT IT IN THE PARALLEL ACCOUNT. WELL IF YOU HAD IT AS WE ASK FOR IN THIS BILL A A A A A A STATEMENT ARE IF YOU'RE ELECTED TO DO BLOCKCHAIN YET A STATEMENT ON THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION WHEN YOU WENT TO THAT BANK. YOU ASKED THAT BANK. BOMB TO OPEN ACCOUNT THEY WOULD SAY WILL YOU SHAREHOLDER WHICH SHOWS THAT WE'RE LEDGER YOU COULDN'T TELL ME THAT YOU COULD TAKE A STOCK CERTIFICATE OF THE BACK OF THE BOOK AND STEEL. AND PHONY IT UP AND USE A SEAL AND MAKE A PHONY CERTIFICATE. THIS BASICALLY HAS SOME VALUE IN THAT RESPECT SECONDLY THERE WAS COMPANY ORANGE COUNTY LIVES IN IRVINE OR TESTING THE CHEMICAL SPILL. IT'S BUT IT'S IN THE NOTES SOMEWHERE IN THE ANALYSIS OF AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS PHONING UP STOCK SHARE CERTIFICATES AND SELLING PHONE SHARES. A SAME KIND OF THING YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO WITH THE COMPANY'S ROSE -- DE DID THAT SO IT DOES HAVE SOME NEAR TERM BENEFITS IT WAS IN MY JUDGMENT THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MANNER. IN WHICH WE COULD BEGIN TO INTRODUCE THIS CONCEPT INTO GOVERNMENT. AND WITH THAT I TOOK OVER MY HANDSOME WITNESS WHO'S GONNA. BLAIR SOCKS OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OFFICE WHEN AS WE THANK IS CENTER HERTZBERG -- GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME I'M JOSEPH CORRAL AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF CAGE CHAIN. CAGE CHAIN IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY IN BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH FIRM. AND I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THE BLOCKCHAIN ADVOCACY COALITION. I AM A FORMERLY FULLY REGISTERED IN A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER AND TRADER. I HAVE EARNED AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN BUSINESS WHEN I BEGAN RESEARCHING WATCHING TECHNOLOGY IN CRYPTO CURRENCIES. I HAVE AUTHORED A PAPER ON THE SUBJECTS AS WELL BEFORE STARTING THE CONSULTANCY CAGE CHAIN. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE REGARDING SENATE BILL. EIGHT THREE EIGHT A BLOCKCHAIN IS A DIGITAL LEDGER TOOL THAT ENABLES DATA TO BE STORED OR TRANSFERRED SECURITY USING SECURELY USING BANK GRADE SECURITY. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS IT ALLOWS BUSINESSES TO GROW AND DEVELOP IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND ITS SECURITY AND VERIFICATION FEATURES. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW JOBS TO BE CREATED AND FORM A NEW SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THEY GRAVITY THANK YOU MUCH. ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS UP PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEN AN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE LET'S BRING BACK TO THERE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. STILL DOES BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AYE AYE. I WON I WON I THINK YOU ARE SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. TO I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT -- BLOCKCHAIN -- IS -- HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL THOSE THAT WILL HELP UP PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY AS WELL AS SECURITY. AND I KNOW I KNOW THAT OTHER STATES HAVE -- USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN VARIOUS ASPECTS I THINK YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF ALREADY. OF FOR EXAMPLE A DRIVERS SO REGISTRATION AND I THINK THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA IS LOOKING MONNING. YEAH ACTUALLY VOTING ABSOLUTELY SO I I THINK IT HAS A GREAT DEAL OF POTENTIAL. AND YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS WHETHER OR NOT OF BLOCKCHAIN COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO COMBAT THE RAND SOMEWHERE I KNOW YOU WORKED ON THAT AS WELL. AND ON THE HILL CURRENTLY I THINK -- WE'RE AT THE MERCY OF THESE -- ALL OF THESE TO THESE -- FIRST HOW PERPETRATORS IN INNOCENCE WHEN WHEN -- BUSINESSES HIT WITH RANSOM WHERE THERE'S NO NO REMEDY I MEAN I THINK. ALL HE COULD DO IS TO GO BACK TO THE LAST THE VISION OF THE BACK UP. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE YOU KNOW THE BACK OF HIS GOOD AS THE LAS BACK UP SO DEPENDING ON WHEN THE TO THE BACKUP SO. SO YOU KNOW HOSPITALS ARE BEING YOU KNOW. WHAT FALLING VICTIMS TO RANSOM WEARING ON THAT SO SO THIS IS POTENTIALLY A A -- SOMETHING THAT WE COULD USE TO COMBAT RANSOMWARE SOME AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT -- MISTER CALDERON SPILL ALSO TWENTY SIX LOOK AT IT STUDY SO THAT WILL TELL US EXACTLY HOW THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED. SO SO I'M VERY EXCITED THAT TO CEASE IS TO THE YOU KNOW THE TO PUT CALIFORNIA AHEAD OF THE CURVE HOUSE ALSO. DISCOVER. AND I JUST WANNA SAY THAT YOU FOR THE BILL AND I'M GLAD WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE MEAN JUST TO TO WILL THAT BE ABLE TO FRAME THE CONVERSATION IS THAT. A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING BLOCKCHAIN THEY DON'T HAVE CERTAINTY BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF REGULATION REGULATION AND THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL. UP OR WILL NOT DO AND SO THEY WANT US AS A STATE TO REGULATE THEM TO CREATE SOME DEFINITIONS THAT ALLOWS THEM THE ABILITY TO KIND OF DO THEIR WORK THEIR OTHER STATES -- THAT HAVE DONE SOME DEFINITIONAL WORK ON ON A BLOCKCHAIN IN AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND THESE COMPANIES HAVE GONE THERE AND OPENED UP. YOU KNOW DOING THINGS AND FARMING COUNTRIES INTO FARMING COMES FARMING ESTATE OF FARMING COMMUNITIES AND SO THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STATE THAT IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING NOW WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. TO TO ALLOW THESE COMPANIES TO WORK WITH SOME TYPE OF ABILITY TO FEEL -- LESS STRESSED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO SOME BECAUSE THERE'S THERE IS STATE REGULATION THEIR STATE DEFINITIONS AYE IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ALLOW US ONE DAY. BOTH FROM OUR CELLPHONES WHICH IS GOING TO BE SEVERAL INCREASED TURNED OUT I KNOW THE SECRETARY STATES ACTUALLY WORKING ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW -- AND SO IT'S A IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY THAT BEING A REPORT ON THE ISSUE. SO WITH THAT CENTER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT IS A HUGE ISSUE IT'S IT AND MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S UNBELIEVABLE ESTONIA IS DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS. BUT THAT BEST VIRGINIA'S VOTING ONLY OCCURRED BECAUSE BRADLEY TASK WAS THE CAMPAIGN PERSON. FOR MAYOR BLOOMBERG I ACTUALLY PAID FOR A LOT OF THE SYSTEM SELF IN AND IT'S A GREAT CHALLENGE IT'S HARD FOR US. TO MODERNIZE IN TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE WHO JUST EXPERIENCED IN PRIVACY. AYE IT WHERE STATUS QUO FOLKS SAY WELL YOU KNOW ARE ARE ARE ARE HOLDING UP THE SYSTEM AND I WAS SURE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS A FIRST IN THE MANY STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE. IN THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE. ALL ACROSS THE BOARD TO TO TO BE LEADERS AND I THINK AS MISTER CALDERON SUGGESTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT GOING TO ACT IN THE NEAR TERM IS TO CHALLENGING. IN THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE INCUBATORS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE A A AN EXTRAORDINARY DEBATER BECAUSE IF WE CAN LEAD ON THE STUFF YOU'RE GONNA SEE STATES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TAKING THIS ON AND REALLY SETTING OF STANDARDS I'M PROUD TO BE INVOLVED WITH THIS AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH THE S. RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WITH THAT -- LOOK -- THERE'S BEEN. MOTION SECONDED AS WELL SO. MADAM SECRETARY RECALL PLEASE MOTIONS DAY PASSES MANAGED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR CHAO I SHOUT HIGH KILEY. BAKER.

SIMILAR PROTECTIONS OF RD BEEN AFFORDED ANOTHER AREAS WE CREATED THE READER PRIVACY ACT THAT CREATES PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AROUND PEOPLE'S READING LESS. AND IT JUST KIND OF GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT SENATOR LARA ALLUDES TO IN WASHINGTON STATE MOTEL SIX REACH THE PRIVACY OF OVER TEN THOUSAND OF THEIR GUESTS NAMES. AND THEY TURNED THEM OVER TO AYE AYES THE NAMES BIRTHDATES DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBERS LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS AND ROOM NUMBERS. AND ARIZONA THEY WERE GENERATING LESS OF EVERYONE THAT WAS STAYING IN THE HOTEL EACH NIGHT AND SENDING IT OVER TO ICE EVERY MORNING. AND THIS RESULTED IN PEOPLE BEING PICKED UP FROM THEIR ROOMS COUPLES SEPARATED ONE DEPORTED IMMEDIATELY THE OTHER STYLE AND ATTENTION. AND THIS WAS ALL DONE DESPITE MIDDLESEX HAVING A CORPORATE POLICY SAYING THAT. THE INFORMATION I GATHERED DURING THEIR VISITS -- WAS TO BE CAP IT AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS WHY THESE COMMONSENSE PROTECTION SHOULD -- THE GIVEN TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SO WHEN THEY TRAVEL THROUGH OUR STATE OR A SPEND A NIGHT AND ONE OF OUR HOTELS THE INFORMATION IS SAFE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MUCH A NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GINA D'SILVA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB. ELEVEN NINETY FOUR A WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE PROTECTIONS AGAINST THESE EFFORTS TO TEAR APART FAMILIES AND DEPORT CALIFORNIANS HAVE HELPED SHAPE OUR STATE.

AND EXTREME FEAR FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR LOVES LOANS STATE ATTRACT OF LYING TO THE PUBLIC OF LYING TO ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WE FEEL THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE AND ENJOY EVERYDAY LIFE -- THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND OUR RESISTANCE AGAINST THE IMPRISONMENT AND DEPORTATION OF CALIFORNIANS A CALLER STAY HOME WE THINK SENATOR LOTT AFRICAN TEAM CHAMPION HE SUFFERED SO WHERE DO SUPPORT.

YOU ON PARTNERS SO WE HAVE CHU LAI AND HERE'S TRUMPS PUTS THEY CAN MATCH NEXT PLACE. I HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER PERSON THE NEXT AND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT AQ AT THE OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COME MISS BAKER CA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND US SENATOR I SUPPORTED A BEFORE FIFTY AND SOME OF THE OTHER EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS WHEN -- FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COME TO THE HOME. TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES TO WORKPLACE SETTINGS -- STORY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS YOUR BILL HAS ON JUST TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS DUE PROCESS WAS THAT'S HOW I READ IT. BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN -- THAT AYE WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS PLEASE ON THOSE THIRD PARTIES NOT BEING ICE BUT BEING THE FEDERAL MARSHAL. BEING US ATTORNEYS BEING FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE THAT -- ARE WORKING TO CONNECT WITH THOSE WHO ARE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS -- AND PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT LODGINGS AND BUSES. AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THE UNITED STATES THE U. S. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THREE OF THE FBI'S TOP TEN HUMAN TRAFFICKING LOCATIONS -- TRAFFICKERS UTILIZE HOTELS THEY UTILIZE BEST SYSTEMS AND I DON'T WANT TO US TO DO ANYTHING PERSONALLY THAT IS GOING TO CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND YOU MAY WANT THEM TO BE OTHER THAN ICE. TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF TASK FORCES. OR INDEPENDENTLY BE ABLE TO FIGHT CRIME THAT IS HAPPENING -- AND AND THIS BASICALLY IS POSSIBLY THE BILL IS POTENTIALLY OVERBROAD IF THE GOAL IS TO PROHIBIT RAIDS AT HOTELS AND BUSES AND AND I AGAIN. I HAVE SUPPORTED OUR EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. TO PROVIDE JUST THE ROUNDING UP OF OTHERWISE INNOCENT PEOPLE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THOSE YOU'RE COMMITTING CRIMES. A THEY CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLEASE BECAUSE THE WAY I READ THE BILL IS IT DOES PROHIBIT THE ABILITY OF OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER THAN NICE. TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THOSE EFFORTS AND LAST THEY GO THROUGH A CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICER WHICH THEN BURDENS ARE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. AND ALMOST FORCES THEM TO HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO DO IT CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLEASE SURE WE CAN HAVE. ARE ASSUME. FOR SO THE DATA THAT'S BEING PROTECTED HERE IS THE ACTUAL LIKE GAS RESTS -- GAS RECORD OR THE PASSENGER RECORD. AND NOT YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL LIKE PERSONS SO IT WOULDN'T STOP ANYONE FROM -- EFFECTUATE AN ARREST WARRANT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND A FEDERAL. OFFICER THAT YOU DESCRIBE CAN STILL GET THAT GAS RECORD A PASSENGER INFORMATION WITH A COURT ORDER OR A WARRANT AND THEN THE FINAL SECTION OF THE BELL HAS AN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES -- WHEN THERE'S A THREAT TO THE BODILY CAUSE THEM? TO INFORMATION WITHOUT GETTING A COURT ORDER OR WARRANT. THANK YOU AND AND PRECIOUS SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT. MY AGAIN REDIFF AND TELL ME IF I'M CORRECT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. BASICALLY -- IMMIGRATION RAIDS AT HOTELS AND BUSES AND WE WANT RIGHT BECAUSE I I HEARD THE TESTIMONY WAS FROM A SUPPORTED WITNESSES. THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH WE WE WANT TO PROTECT THESE AGENCIES HAVE LIED I THINK IT WAS SAID IN THAT THEY'RE GOING AFTER PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO RESIST. AND WE WHY THEN PUT UP ANY BARRIERS THAT'S THE GOAL. WHY PUT UP ANY BARRIERS BETWEEN NON ICE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVEN KEEP THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO WIPE Y. PUT? HOOPS THAT THEY HAVE TO NOW JUMP THROUGH IN ORDER TO FIGHT CRIME -- THAT IS OUTSIDE OF AN IMMIGRATION POLICY. WHY PUT THOSE SHIPS BEFORE THEM WHY IS THAT NECESSARY IF THE GOAL IS TO BE PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM ICE RATES WHICH AGAIN I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC? TO RIGHT WHAT WATER PROTECTED DATA AS AS OUR WITNESSES WAS SANE AND WE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS -- IS CERTAIN STATES LITERALLY IF YOU HAD A SPANISH LAST NAME YOUR NAME AUTOMATICALLY GOT ON THE LIST AND THEY GOT CENTER ICE. I WOULD AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TELL PREVENT I MEAN WE DON'T WANNA OBVIOUSLY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP IN THE EFFORTS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BUT WE FEEL THAT IT'S THE DATA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT HERE AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE BILL. WE WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JUST LIMITING ITS REACH TO ICE. INSTEAD OF ALL THIRD PARTY MINT BECAUSE THAT IS VERY BROAD. I'M AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO MEND YOUR BILL ON THE FLY IN COMMITTING THAT -- WE YOU KNOW HAVE HAD IS THERE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT MADE IT THAT [inaudible] NARROWING SURGICAL. MEANWHILE THE BILL IS ALSO FOCUS HAS A LOT OF FOCUS ON ICE IT IS ALSO JUST -- GOOD PRIVACY PROTECTION TO LIMIT DISCLOSURE OF THIS VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION YOU TURN OVER. ALLOTTED DATA TO BOOK A HOTEL ROOM OR REVOKE -- A BUS TICKET AND SO WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS STRUCTURE GIVES GOOD PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND ALL SENSE FOR ALL CONSUMERS -- OF THEIR DATA AND THOUGHT IT STRUCK A REASONABLE BALANCE ON WHO THE LAWS DISCLOSURES TO IN THE CONTEXT THAT IT ALLOWS. DISCLOSURES TO WITH A COURT ORDER A WARRANT IF SOMEONE IS TARGETING A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATION. IT SEEMS THAT THERE WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO GET WARRANTS FOR THIS INFORMATION CAME HERE IT SEEMS IT WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO GET WARRANTS YOU MAY BE CORRECT THAT'S VERY THEORETICAL AND I'M THINKING OF WHO ARE THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOW PREVALENT IT IS HOW EASY IT. IS. TO SKIRT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SO MANY WAYS HOW DIFFICULT THE CRIMES ARE TO PROSECUTE AND IF THE GOAL IS DATA PROTECTION IT'S JUST GOOD POLICY TO HAVE A BE ON ICE WE HAVE SOME OF WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PASSING THEM TODAY. AND IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE STATE HAS VERY RIGOROUS PRIVACY PROTECTIONS NOW. FOR YOU KNOW BEST PRACTICES. ATTACKED CONSUMER DATA I JUST -- I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY IN GREAT HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER NARROWING THIS MUCH MORE SURGICALLY -- WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT PUT UP OOPS BETWEEN. A LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO GO AFTER HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO GO ACTIVE GO AFTER VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THEY USED THESE LEDGERS THEY USE THIS INFORMATION TO TRACK DOWN RINGS I'VE HAD THREE HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS BROKEN UP IN MY DISTRICT JUST IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND SO I I REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT -- BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S OVER BROAD AND I THINK THAT WHAT ORIGINAL GOAL OF HAVE PROTECTING PEOPLE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. I'M WITH YOU. OF SO I'M I REALLY HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT THANK YOU. AS OUR IN DEPTH -- THAT WAS THE INTERESTING DISCUSSION AYE AYE ME I'M. SORT OF SURPRISED THAT THESE -- IF WE'RE JUST WANNA PRIVACY THAT THESE LETTERS ARE NOT ALREADY PROTECTED THAT THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY THAT ASKS FOR THEM AND AND IS SPECIFICALLY ON YOUR CONCERNS. I THINK. BUT I GUESS I CAN ASK THAT THE QUESTION. HOW IF YOU HAVE A HUMAN TRAFFICKING? GENERALLY IS IN A LOCAL. CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S GOING AFTER IT NOT NECESSARILY THE FEDS AND IF IT'S THE FEDS WOULDN'T THEY BE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE. HOWEVER WE USUALLY DEALING WITH SITUATIONS LIKE [inaudible] THAT. I'M SORRY THAT IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE Y. BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT FOUND WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT FIELD I IMAGINE IT IS. LOCALS THAT ARE OFTEN DOING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THAT BUT SO. THE LOCALS IF THEY THINK THERE'S A CRIME CAN STILL GET THE LEDGER AND THERE IS NO RESTRICTIONS AT ALL. AND FOR THE FEDS IF IT HAPPENS THERE INVOLVED WITHOUT THE LOCALS AND THEY CAN JUST GET A SUBPOENA CROWD COURT ORDER AWARENESS. AND BUT THIS IS WHAT THE SITUATION IS RIGHT NOW THAT LEDGER IS AVAILABLE. TO ALMOST ANY AGENCY WHICH TO ME SEEMS A PRIVATE LIKE A PRIVACY ISSUE SO I I I I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT I MEAN THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS TURNED BEING TURNED OVER TO ICE I THINK IS. TERRIBLE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRIVACY PART THOSE LEDGER SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO JUST ANY AGENCY IT SHOULD BE. PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING AFTER CRIMINALS [inaudible] SO YOU. WE AGREE. BUT I BET IT WOULD BE OF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THE STATISTICS ON IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING PLEASE. CERTAINLY DON'T GET FROM HERE TO THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL DO SOME MORE RESEARCH ON FOLLOW UP WITH SUMMER BAKER ON ON ON OUR HOME BRITISH ISSUE BROUGHT UP TODAY. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST I'M SORRY. IF IT IF IT COULD AND COULD I MEAN I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AS YOUR AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS THE WHAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT FOR WHAT PURPOSE TO OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. IF WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT THAT SEEMS LIKE HOMEWORK. THE SPONSORSHIP BICU AND THAT THAT SO THAT WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT BE IMPAIRING. BUT IT COULD BE. A VARIETY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IT COULD BE A VARIETY OF FRAUD CRIMES THAT THERE'S JUST A LOT AND SO I I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO REALLY -- LOOK AT AND GET A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHERWISE USES IT FOR AND AGAINST IF YOU GET SURGICAL THANKS FOR INDULGING ME ON THAT SECOND POINT. MR OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER OTHER DIFFERENT CONCERN WITH THE BILL THE ENFORCEMENT IN THIS BILL CREATES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHERE. SOMEONE WHO IS SUBJECTED TO A NON AUTHORIZED BREACH OF THEIR INFORMATION. THEN CAN BRING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST THE AGENCY THAT -- THE EFFECTUALLY THAT THAT BREACH NOW OTHER. CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS THAT WE HAVE PASSED RECENTLY FACT WHEN WE PASSED EARLIER THAT IN THIS HEARING TODAY. I HAVE A YOU KNOW I SIMILAR SUBJECT MATTER BUT THEY ENTRUST ENFORCEMENT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CITY ATTORNEYS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. AND I THINK IN CASES LIKE THIS THAT'S A MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE BECAUSE A DATA BREACH. BY AN AGENCY IS LIKELY TO BE NOT JUST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE BUT A WHOLE CLASS OF PEOPLE AND IT SEEMED LIKE. AVOIDING THOSE KIND OF SYSTEMIC ABUSES WOULD BE BETTER HANDLED BY SOMEONE LIKE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN YOU. CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DIDN'T GO THAT ROUTE INSTEAD CREATED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL. WE THINK THAT BOTH REMEDIES ARE APPROPRIATE HERE THIS. TYPE A DISCLOSURE ONE AND BE A DATA BREACH -- SITUATION IT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL HOTEL A BUS COMPANY VOLUNTARILY TURNS THIS INFORMATION OVER SO. THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS IN THIS LAW PUTS THEM ON CLEAR NOTICE THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE IS NOT PERMITTED AND SO WE THINK IF THEY WERE. TO TAKE THAT AFFIRMATIVE STEP DESPITE THAT THAN HAVING THE OPTION OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE HARMED BY THIS IS APPROPRIATE WHILE STILL ALLOWING? FOR ALL THE OTHER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CITIZENS TOURNEY'S AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. DOES THE BILL ACTUALLY ALLOW THAT BECAUSE I DON'T READ THAT IN THE BILL. I BELIEVE IT DOES ADAM MCCANN LOOK INTO THAT MAKE SURE. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY PROHIBITION. ON AS IN ANY LAWS THAT ARE ON THERE AT WHAT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT ULTIMATELY MY CONCERN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AREAS. IN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN WHAT WE WERE ON THE SAME TEAM WHERE WE WANT TO ENFORCE. STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PREDATORY LAW FIRMS OUT THERE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR EXCUSES TO INSTITUTE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE THEIR MOTIVE IS NOT ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW THERE FORCED. THEIR MOTIVE IS TO MAKE MONEY. AND THEY TRY AND PICK UP LITTLE GOTCHA CASES WHERE THERE BEN ON AUTHOR OF PERHAPS UNWITTING VIOLATIONS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW AND AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY USE THAT TO EXPLOIT. THE COMPANIES THAT WERE INVOLVED AND A THAT THAT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENFORCE. CONSUMER PROTECTION LINE SO I I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSETHE BILL. TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT AND ONE ENCOURAGE YOU IF THERE'S A BILL MOVES FORWARD HERE TO CONSIDER. CHANGING THE ENFORCEMENT TO BE. GOVERNMENTAL ATTORNEYS GENERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEYS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO BRING ACTION IN CASES LIKE THIS. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR WHEN I'D QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE ARE LET LET ME THANK -- THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK OVERALL IT'S A IT'S A GOOD MEASURES VERY GOOD MEASURE AS ONE OF ADDRESSES. SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED AND LET ME ENEMY SAY THAT UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT EITHER FEDERAL OR OTHERWISE. ON WHEN THE DEMAND FOR THESE RECORDS WOULD THAT WOULD REQUIRE A WARRANT -- I THINK THE BILL ONLY LIMITS THOUGH THE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE -- OF THESE RECORDS TO THIRD PARTIES IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN INCLUDING OUR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IS THAT NOT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT SO SO I THINK I THINK ARE YOU KNOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT SUPPORTING THE BILL -- AS HIS BUT I DO WANT TO ASK THE SENATOR -- TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT BEEN RAISED TODAY ARE AND IF SO TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN YOU CAN PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED AS WELL THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD ABSOLUTELY WILL COME FROM THE WORK ON THE ISSUES THAT. SUMMER BAKER BROUGHT UP THOSE IMPACTS ONLY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT FOUND. YEAH TO SPARSELY AFFECTING ANY TYPE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES AGAIN AND REGARDS TO MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER OBERNOLTE. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S WILLINGLY GIVING OUT INFORMATION -- I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE WOODROW FOLKS THAT ARE SEEKING REMEDIES PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE. AYE AS OPPOSED TO A DATA BREACH WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT. SO I'M AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION.
