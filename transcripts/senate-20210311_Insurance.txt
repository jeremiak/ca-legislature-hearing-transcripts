IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM A BROAD VARIETY OF STAKE HOLDERS. ON THE GENERAL STATE OF THE STATE OF THE HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL MARKET. AND HONE IN ON SEVERAL SPECIFIC WELFARE RELATED ISSUES. AFFECTING CONSUMERS THAT HAVE SURFACED IN RECENT MONTHS. WITH FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRES BURNED THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE SEASON. WAS THE LARGEST MODERN THE RECORDED IN ACCOUNTS FOR FIVE OF THE TOP TWENTY LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. TRAGICALLY OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED. AND THIRTY ONE PEOPLE KILLED. DURING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE SEASON UTILITY COSTS BARS WERE CENTER STAGE CAUSING DEVASTATING FIRES THAT BROKE RECORDS. LAST AUGUST LIGHTNING STRIKES EXPOSE DIFFERENT WEAKNESS. THE HUNDREDS OF FIRES STARTED BY LIGHTNING STORMS EVENTUALLY BECAME THE AUGUST COMPLEX FIRE. BRINGING OVER ONE MILLION ACRES ACROSS SIX COUNTIES. ANOTHER LINING COMPLEX FIRE BFE YOU BURNED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES BECOMING THE THIRD LARGEST IN STATE HISTORY. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES FROM A ON. TWO MORE LINING COMPLEX FIRES THE L. IN YOU AND THAT'S EASY YOU EACH COSTS AT LEAST TWO BILLION IN INSURED LOSSES. THE GLASS SPIRE WHICH CAUSES STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION COST ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN LOSSES. AS CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER TRAGEDIES OF THIS MAGNITUDE OCCUR THE COMMITTEE HAS BECOME AWARE OF SEVERAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE WHERE WILDFIRE RISK IS A CONCERN. WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IS THE MANY COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE COME TO MY ATTENTION FROM BUSINESSES INSTEAD OF PRIMARY HOMEOWNERS. UNTIL RECENTLY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AVAILABILITY DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY RECENT WILDFIRES AS HOMEOWNER LINES. HOWEVER NOW IMPACTED AND VOICING CONCERNS INCLUDE FARMS RANCHES AND VINEYARDS TIMBER INDUSTRY PRESCRIBER NURSE HOMEBUILDERS CAMPGROUND OPERATORS AMONG OTHERS. IN SOME INSTANCES THE AVAILABILITY CONCERNS IS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE AND IN OTHERS ITS LIABILITY. IN ALL CASES IT IS MY HOPE. THAT THE DISCUSSION AND HEARING HERE TODAY LEAVES US ALL WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON HOW. WE CAN TACKLE THIS ONGOING CRISIS. THAT IS IMPACTING ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT CAN'T WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THEM. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS HARDLY ANY AREA LAUGH NOT TOUCHED BY THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES. ON A POSITIVE NOTE AND TO MUCH ANTICIPATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS RECENTLY RELEASED A DRAFT REGULATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF MODELING AND RATEMAKING AND ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP TO CREATE STATE HOME A COMMUNITY HARD ANY RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF COMPUTER COMPUTER RISK MODELS IN UNDERWRITING DECISIONS AND WHAT ROLE THEY MIGHT PLAY AND RATEMAKING. THAT CONTINUED PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION FROM STAKEHOLDERS IS WELCOME. AS IT IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX UNDERTAKING SINCE THE REGULATIONS ARE SO NEW WE WON'T TAKE FOCUS ON THEM HERE TODAY BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A FULLER CONVERSATION ON THEM AT A LATER DATE I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BRIEF ME. PRIVATELY BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE GIVEN. EIGHT SEVEN SIX EIGHT NINE FOUR ONE. OUR FIRST PANEL HERE TODAY WILL CONSIST OF MICHAEL MARTINEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND MARK SECTION REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. WELCOME MISTER MARTINEZ AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY- AND PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR RUBIO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MIKE MARTINEZ. SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA I'M ALSO JOINED HERE VIRTUALLY WITH MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN TENLEY. SERVES AS DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL. AND SO THE ABSENCE TURNS COMMITTEE HAVE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT FOR OUR PERSPECTIVE REGARDING EMERGING ISSUES AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE SPACE GIVING OUR STATE'S ONGOING WILDFIRES. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE OPENING REMARKS FROM. THE SHARE. OF WE DO LOOK FORWARD AFTER COMMISSIONER DOES LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH YOU AND ALL MEMBERS HAS LOST ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE THAT- HE HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THESE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MY HIGH% LEVEL REMARKS WILL TOUCH ON THE GROWING EFFECTIVE WILDFIRES ON THE AVAILABILITY. AFFORDABILITY AND RELIABILITY ISSUE FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE ACROSS OUR STATE AFFECTING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES. AND INITIAL THOUGHTS AND WAYS TO HELP ADDRESS THIS GROWING ISSUE. SO FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE PRIMER A LITTLE A BRIEF BRIEF BACKGROUND OF THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE STATUS. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE HAS REQUIRED PRIOR APPROVAL OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE RATES BY THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. IS RATES CANNOT BE EXCESSIVE. AND ADEQUATE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY OR OTHERWISE IN VIOLATION PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER REGULATES THESE RATES THESE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE RATES BUT CANNOT REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SELL AND MARSHALL INSURANCE TO ANY GIVEN POLICY FOLDER. IN OTHER WORDS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CANNOT COMPEL AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO WRITE IN A CERTAIN PART OF THE STATE OR CONTINUE TO WRITE A PARTICULAR BUSINESS SECTOR AS LONG AS THE ACTION BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY JUST TO JUST CONTINUE WRITING. IS NOT UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY WHICH CAN BE DETERMIED FURTHER THROUGH ITS UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES. ALSO YOU'VE HEARD- DISCUSSED YOU YEARS. HE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER A MEASURE THAT HE HAD AUTHORED BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A AS A STATE SENATOR S. C. H. U. FOR. DANCE THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS ISSUED MANDATORY ONE YEAR MORATORIUM SO WHENEVER GOVERNOR DECLARES AN EMERGENCY AND THE SYSTEMIC CONTEXT THE WILDFIRES- HOWEVER HE DOES NOT HAVE THAT SIMILAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ISSUE. A SIMILAR MORATORIUM FOR COMMERCIAL POLICIES AND COMMERCIAL- POLICYHOLDERS UNLIKE AS HE DOES AND HAS IN THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE SPACE. SO THEREFORE RELATED I'M COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES CANNOT RENEW I WILL IMMEDIATELY AFTER WILDFIRE AND BECAUSE INSURERS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO WRITE IN THE WE ARE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY PREFER TO AVOID RESTORING ON RENEWING RATHER THAN PROPERLY PRICING RESTS IN THE MOVIE. A REGARDING THE MORATORIUMS. I'M SURE THAT YOU ALL HAVE HEARD THAT HE- THE COMMISSIONER HAS ISSUED A HANDFUL OF ONE YEAR MORATORIUM SO MANY TOWARD MORE AND MORE TORRANCE AND THE- PERSONAL HOMEOWNER SPACE. LAST FALL WHICH TO DATE IS MARCH FORUMS COLLECTIVELY COVER MORE THAN TWO POINT FOUR MILLION POLICY HOLDERS STATEWIDE MORE THAN 18% OF THE STATE'S PRESIDENTIAL INSURANCE MARKETS. SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT NO AT THIS POINT IN TIME REGARDING COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AVAILABILITY. READ THE DEPARTMENT MOSTLY HAVE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE TO DATE VERSES OUR CORNER BONTA BIBLE DATA. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME DATA TO SHARE. ACCORDING TO OUR LATEST REPORTING IN TWENTY NINETEEN AGRIBUSINESS. ACCOUNTED FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND WRITTEN PREMIUMS SPENDING ACROSS SEVERAL CATEGORIES INCLUDING FARM OWNERS COMMERCIAL MULTI PERIL COMMERCIAL LIABILITY AND ALLIED LINES. AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN NATIONWIDE AGRIBUSINESS INSURANCE COMPANY THE LARGEST WRITER OF AGRIBUSINESS RISKS IN THE COUNTRY RIGHTS APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. HARTMAN APPROVED APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX AGRIBUSINESS RELATED RATE APPLICATIONS REPRESENTING FIFTY SIX UNIQUE ADMITTED INSURERS. WE ARE STILL RESEARCHING HOW MANY ADMITTED INSURERS ARE CURRENTLY STILL WRITING POLICIES IN THIS SPACE BUT ONLY TWENTY SIX OF THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX RATE APPLICATIONS THAT I MENTIONED WERE APPROVED BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY INDICATING PERHAPS THE SHRINKAGE IN THE MARKET. THE DEPARTMENT'S MARKET SHARE REPORT SHOWED THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCURRED LOSS RATIO WHICH IS A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH OF EACH PREMIUM DOLLAR IS IN TURN SENT TO PAY CLAIMS. OF FOR FARM OWNERS POLICIES WAS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. ALTHOUGH IT HAS DECLINED SOMEWHAT IT REMAINS RELATIVELY HIGH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. SAYS SUGGESTING COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO PAY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT ON CLAIMS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PREMIUM DOLLAR STUFF THEY ACTUALLY COLLECT. SOURCE ONE CAN ARGUE THAT THIS MAKES OF THIS OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET LESS DESIRABLE- TO INSURERS. SO WHAT DOES THIS THIS APPARENT HARDENING OF THE INCH OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET PLACE MEANS IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ARE THE FACTORS FOR WHY WE'RE SEEING THIS YEAR TODAY. THE DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN THESE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS HARDENING COMMERCIAL MARKET. IT'S INCLUDED FACTORS SUCH AS CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN GLOBAL MARKETS CLEARLY THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT REGION SENIOR TO LIVE AND UNDER. OUR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND WORLD IN FACT- IS CONTINUES TO EXACERBATE THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE- IN OUR STATE NATION AND- WORLD. SO THE CONTINUED GLOBAL PANDEMIC R. R. SEVERAL YEARS THE WILDFIRES. HURRICANES IN THE SOUTHEAST FLOODING IN THE MIDWEST NORTHEASTERN STORMS BUYING WITH INCREASED CLAIMS ACTIVITY ALL OF THAT- IS REALLY AGAIN EXACERBATING WE BELIEVE- AND CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN AVAILABILITY. ECONOMIC DOWNTURN UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET- FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EPIDEMIC CONTINUES TO BE A FACTOR THAT WE SEE. SHRINKING INSURANCE CAPITAL DECREASED COMPETITION AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF REINSURANCE ALSO IS A FACTOR AND THEN WE HEAR AT ALL THESE FACTORS. CONVERGING AT THE SAME TIME AGAIN IT REALLY DOES- SIR TO BE A YEAR- IT'S JUST A PERFECT STORM IN REGARDS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IN THE MARKET AND AGAIN I KNOW WE WILL HEAR FROM US SEVERAL IN INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVES WHO. WILL LIKELY. REITERATE WHAT I'M SAYING HERE TODAY. I WOULD SAY THAT- AS A GENERAL REMINDER THAT- SURPLUS LINES INSURERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AND IT'S PRETTY PROTECTION RULES BUT THEY DO SERVE A PURPOSE. FOR IF AND WHEN IT- INDIVIDUALS AND DID IT IN LINE- I'M SURE IS IN THE ADMITTED LYING OR NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE. ADEQUATE PRODUCTS TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES DURING THIS TIME SO DID SURPLUS LINES IS A J. A COMPETITIVE. PLAYER IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET PLACE THE FAIR PLAN IS. ALSO CAN BE. THE AS A PLAYER THE STATE AS WELL. YET I WOULD KNOW THAT THEY MAY NOT BE A VIABLE LONG TERM BACKSTOPS FOR MOST BUSINESSES DO TO THE FAIR PLANS RELATIVELY LOW POLICY LIMIT OF THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN AGGREGATE- ALL COVERAGES COMBINED AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST COMMERCIAL ENTITIES THEY WOULD NEED COVERAGE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS. OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SO- IT'S JUST THE FAIR PLAN MAY NOT BE AS VIABLE AS A BACKSTOP. AS WELL AS THE FAIR PLAN COVERAGE THEY DO HAVE LIMITED. SCOPE IN BOTH- IN TERMS OF TYPES OF COMMERCIAL POLICY SOLD AND COVERAGE LIMITS. WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE THREE MILLION OR STRUCTURES AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR ALL OTHER I COVERAGE SPEECHES WRITTEN BUT BASS- IN AREAS OF. OF- I WAS- WHAT WERE THE CAN ONLY SOME BY THE FAIR PLAN. SO NEXT IS JUST WHAT HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HURT WE HAVE HELD CONVERSATIONS CONVERSATIONS WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS- RANGING FROM. AGRIBUSINESS THE TIMBER INDUSTRY FARMS AND WINERIES AND DINNERS BROKERS AND PRODUCERS AMONG MANY OTHERS SHE REALLY PROVIDE A FULLER PICTURE OF HOW WILDFIRES HAVE AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HAVE AN IMPACT IN VERY LIMITED THEY HAVE IN FACT ALSO THAN THE LAST HANDFUL OF MONTHS. AND WE DO REALLY DO APPRECIATE. HEARING DIRECTLY ONTHE GROUND FROM A VARIETY OF THESE ENTITIES AND A LOT OF IT- IT RANGES FROM. THE FROM INCREASE AND WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THE PREMIUMS GOING FROM DOUBLES TO TRIPLE THE AMOUNT FOR EXAMPLE ONE BUSINESS. AT ITS RATES DOUBLE AND POLICY LIMITS DECREASED- FROM ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO NOW FIFTY MILLION LEAVING THEM EXPOSED FOR YOUNG COVERED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HAVING TO GO BACK OUT. TO OTHER PLAYERS IN THE MARKET TO FIND OR STACKED. COVERAGE AND SO WE'RE SEEING A HEARING FROM THE SO. OF REDUCTION IN THE ABILITY OF SUGGEST COVERAGE. AND THE COVERAGE ISABEL JANET STUFF OR TRIPLE AND- GEN. TWENTY YOU HAVE A PROXY TWO MINUTES THANK YOU OKAY NO THANK YOU THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR. SO WHAT I CAN AND THEN IF YOU WANNA JUST JUMP TO AND LOOKING AHEAD I DO WANT TO- STATE TAX. SO IN ADDITION TO AFFECTED. BUSINESSES GOING BACK OUT TO- TO LOOK OUT FOR. A PAYING. LOOKING AT RISK THE COVERAGE LEVEL OR LARGER DEDUCTIBLE- WE ALSO- THE ENGINES ALL A LARGELY DEPENDENT. THE DEPARTMENT IS ITS OUT OF CALL IN ORDER TO GATHER NECESSARY DATA FROM COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES WE FEEL THAT THIS INFORMATION BE HELPFUL TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE INITIATIVE NON RENEWALS AND THE IMPACT OF THE HARDING OF THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. WORD FROM AT THE ANECDOTAL ACTUALLY THE HARD DATA IS TO BE THE FIRST EVER. COMMERCIAL INSURANCE DATA CALL AS IT RELATES TO WILDFIRES THAT WE WILL BE INITIATED IN THE NEXT HANDFUL OF WEEKS- I THINK YOU. SHOULD RUBIO FOR TALKING ABOUT THE- USE THE MODELING AND RATE MAKING THAT IS ONE OTHER COMPONENT THAT THE COMMISSIONERS LOOKING AT TO TACKLE THE IN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE- AVAILABILITY. THE COMMISSIONERS ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE GOVERNOR ADMINISTRATION ON A- HARD. NAME COMMITTEE AND HOME HARDING STAND FOREIGN. AS WELL AS I WANTED TO IT IN IN CLOSELY. IS THAT TO THE CHAIRS BILL ELEVEN. BACK TO THREE AMENDED TAKES THE DEFINITION OF BASIC PROPERTY. TO EXCLUDE HER CROPPERS OR THE PURPOSE OF RIGHT A FAIR POLICY. THE DEPARTMENT IS STILL REVIEWING BILL BUT WE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF OTHER CONCEPT PLAN THAT. ARM REST OR ELSE FOR COVER UNDER PLAN. WHERE TAX AND PRESCRIBED BURNING TALKING WITH CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. ON A THE ISSUE FOR TO HAVE DUTY ENERGY TRUCKS FOR HAPPENED AND QUESTIONS ON THAT. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I CONCLUDE MY AND LOOK ANSWER QUESTION WITH MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TINA I WILL. GO TO MARS. REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUAL INSURER ITSELF. AND THEY WILL TAKE FROM. MISTER SECOND. MORE MADAM CHAIR MEMBER OF THE CAN- THIS IS SOUND BUT I REALLY WAY I WAS THERE SO IN THE HOT SEAT NEXT TO AND OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARK SECOND THEN I'M VICE STATE RELATES FOR THE PROPERTY CASH INSURANCE.

BY MANY YEARS OF DROUGHTAN AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION NEW COMMUNITIES BUILT IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. NUMEROUS HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE NOW AT RISK EACH YEAR. THESE LARGE WIND BROWN FIRES BURNED THROUGH ENTIRE TOWNS NUMBERS CONSUMER COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WERE LOST ONE SIDE HOMES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAPITALS LIKE CAR FIRES COMBINE DESTROYED APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED STRUCTURES. OF THESE APPROXIMATE SIXTEEN HUNDRED WORK COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES ARE JUST OVER ONE THIRD. THERE WAS A FIRE IN MALIBU IN THE CAMPFIRE PARADISE DIGITALER SAW SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES LOST. 55% AND 41% OF DESTROYED STRUCTURES BEING COMMERCIAL RESPECTFULLY.

COMMUNICATION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES AS OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES. BUT IN THE RIGHT WAYS OR EASEMENTS THEY HAVE FOR THIS EQUIPMENT ARE SUBJECT TO AN ACCUMULATION OF BUSH AND BREED THAT CAN FUEL WILDFIRES AND THERE MAY BE AN ENHANCED LIABILITY RISK IF THEY DID NOT CLEAR THE DEBRIS AND BRUSH.

SLOW DOWN JUST A BIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- AS MENTIONED ALL LINES OF. CHIU WITH THE- WORKERS BECAUSE OUR- BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND BOTH RATES AND FORMS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. FOR A COMPANY CAN USE THAT. ONE COMMERCIAL INSURERS OF TYPICALLY FACE LESS CONSUMER GROUP INTERVENTION AT A QUICKER RATE APPROVAL PROCESS THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURERS. THIS IS DON'T WANDER TRUE. IN FACT MARSHALL INSURERS FACED A GREAT APPROVAL FOR EASE AND POSE BY THE DEPARTMENT AS A REACTION TO THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT APPROVING ANY COMMERCIAL RATED CRIME REQUEST FOR BROAD ARRAY OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THIS INCLUDES RATES WHICH WERE ANALYZED AND READY TO BE APPROVED WHEN THE PANDEMIC. IT BACK AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. I TWENTY TWO THE TRADITIONAL INSURERS RIGHT SPECIFIED LINES OF INSURANCE TO PROVIDE PREMIUM RELIEF TO POLICY HOLDERS. AMONG THE LIVES COVERED BY THE ORDER ARE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE. COMMERCIAL MULTI PERIL INSURANCE COMMERCIAL LIABILITY INSURANCE AND ANY OTHER LINE OF THE COVERAGE THE MEASURE RISK HAVE BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT. A. B. C. I. A. MEMBERS MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOON AFTER THE ORDER WAS ANNOUNCED. STRESSED THAT MANY BUSINESSES WORKING TO CENTRAL AND RATHER THAN SEE A DECREASE OF REST. THE LINES WERE ACTUALLY SILVA INCREASE AND REST. A MEMBERS ALSO POINT OUT MANY COMMERCIAL POLICIES TRUE PROVISION. SETS MANY COMMERCIAL POLICIES ARE BASED ON THE SIZE PAYROLL OR REVENUE THE BUSINESS THE BUSINESS PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE OPERATION DURING THE UPCOMING POLICY YEAR AT THE END OF THE POLICY- AN AUDIT IS CONDUCTED. IF THE BUSINESS GREW MORE THAN EXPECTED BUSINESS LISTING MARC RICH. IF THE BUSINESS GREW MORE SLOWLY OR SHUT DOWN DUE TO CO THAT THE BUSINESS WILL. RECEIVE A RESPONSE. I HAVE SPOKEN TO SEE STAFF OF THE- AND POINTED OUT THE ISSUES THE PIZZA MEMBERS RAISED IN OCTOBER TWENTY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY. DEPARTMENT STAFF ASKED FOR EXAMPLE WINDS RICHARDS. IS UNLIKELY THERE WAS ANY COMMON REGULATED REDUCTION. I PROVIDED% EXAMPLES BACK IN JANUARY. SINCE JANUARY I'VE BEEN CALLING EVERY OTHER WEEKEND AND TOLD THE DEPARTMENT MEETING ON THE ISSUE. AND WILL HAVE AN ANSWER SOON BUT TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY. I TOO AM START HERE FROM. SOURCE FROM TO FIND. IN THE MIDDLE. BECAUSE INSURERS ARE NOT WRITING THESE POLICIES TO INADEQUATE RATES. IN ONE EXAMPLE IN HONOR OF A LARGE APARTMENT COMPLEX COULD NOT GET COVERAGE FROM HIS INSURER. INSURER COULD NOT CONTINUE TO WRITE BUSINESS WITHOUT A RATE INCREASE WHICH IS APPARENTLY FROZEN AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. DEPARTMENT OWNER HAD TO FIND COVERAGE IN SECONDARY MARKET THE PREMIUMS 3100% MORE. THAN WHAT HE WAS PAYING PREVIOUSLY. THE NATIONAL CALL OF THE NC CAN BE PASSED ON TO TENANTS WHO MAY NOT BE PAYING RENT. WITH MANY OF THE TENANTS WORK AT HOME THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A POLICY. FOR THE RIVER IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASED COVER NOT DECREASED. MISTER SECOND CAN YOU PLEASE- PROP UP YOUR COMMENTS YOU WANT TO GIVE THAT MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS THINK. OF IT AS WELL BUT I JUST WANT A COUPLE COMMENTS OF PRESCRIBED BURNS. OF WHICH ARE BEFORE RISK. FORM FOR REFORM FOR SPANISH EVENT BRACKETS FOR MANY YEARS. I FIRST DISCOVERED THIS WHEN WE DID A TOUR OF THE SAGE CAN EXPERIMENT FOREST NORTH OF TRUCKEE. WHICH IS BEING RUN BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. PART OF THEIR STRATEGY IS TO FILL THEFORCED TO BURN THE PILES OF DEBRIS. THE FORCE TOLD SHORTAGE ON THOSE OF MANY OF THE CHALLENGES INCLUDING. LIMITATIONS ON SMOKE AND WHEN YOU CAN BURKE TYPICALLY THEY BURN IN THE WINTER WHEN THE SURROUNDING FOREST. IS NOT AS BRIGHT AS IT IS IN STOCK THE SHELVES FOR THE SPREAD OF FIRE. BUT WINTER CONDITIONS ALSO KEEP THE SMOKE CLOSER TO THE GROUND. AS MICHAEL MENTIONED AIR POLLUTION IS A HUGE ISSUE AT TWENTY SEVENTEEN. RESOURCES FOR THE STUDY OF THE NORTH BAY FIRESTORM. AND FOUND THAT THREE DAYS OF THAT FIRE PRODUCES MUCH AIR POLLUTION AS THE ANNUAL OUTPUT OF ALL CARS AND TRUCKS. IN CALIFORNIA. AND AB LAST SUMMER ONE WHO IN SAN. NEED THE RIGHT OF HOW MUCH SMOKE PART PERMITS. COULD WE NEED TO SEE ABOUT BETWEEN BETWEEN. MORE PRESCRIBED BURNS FOR OR LESS THE SPARE WHILE AND COMPANIES. BECAUSE OF THE NASA TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF COVERING PRESCRIBER FROM INSURANCE PERSPECTIVE. WE TALKED WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A MEMBER WHO WRITES THIS COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO TALK TO THEIR CHIEF UNDERWRITER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE NOTED IS THAT SURE DOES CHOOSE TO UNDER. INSURE THAT DOES CHOOSE ON RIGHT THAT'S STRESSED WHAT DO SO CAREFULLY OFF EXTENSIVELY INQUIRE NUMBER LOCATION PLAN TYPE OF ADJACENT LAND OWNERS THE FEDERAL STATE OR PRIVATE RESOURCES EQUIPMENT INVOLVED. AND OTHER CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS AND BE HERE TOO. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON THE LIMIT ON OUT OF SMOKE THAT MAY PROVE TO OVER HIGHWAY. FIVE SEARCH INSIDE AS THESE GREAT OF OUR LIFE CAN. WHICH IN. MAKE IT STOP. TO WHETHER THEY WERE THIS TIME OF COVERAGE OR HOW MUCH THEY WERE. STRIVE FIRES BY SURVIVE. IN THE RIGHT. WITH THE- PRECAUTIONS ARE- SAY. JUST IN THE NECK STATE FOR THE FOR EVENTS HELP BUT THE NEEDS TO BE DAHLE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF. HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE TO COVER LOSSES FROM FIRE THAT ESCAPES THE DESIGNATED BURNER. DEFENSE LITIGATION GENERALLY MAKES UP A LARGER PORTION OF COVERAGE SHOPPERS IMPROPER INDEMNIFICATION ESCORTED EDUCATION SOME CALIFORNIA. PRESENT CITY OF AND COST CONCERNS A DENTAL LIKE THE DEFENSE LITIGATION. IS MICHAEL NOTED MANY INSURERS ARE NOT RIGHT IN LIABILITY POLICIES OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN POLICIES ARE OFTEN REGION. COULD DEFENSE COSTS WITHIN THE POLICY. SOMEONE OPERATORS ARE HAVING TO ON LAW SUM INSURED. INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS OPPOSED BY THEIR CUSTOM. IN ADDITION TO REINSURERS DO NOT HAVE ANY UP BECAUSE CURRENTLY FORGET FIRE DEFINITELY. WHAT IS YOUR SECOND I'M SO SORRY DECAL MORE TIME BUT- WE HAVE LIMON TIME IN THE IN THE FOR CAN WRAP UP THE CALL FOR THE SHOP OKAY QUESTIONS. THEY YOU SO VERY MUCH- MEMBERS ANY. FOR PLEASE DO AT THIS TIME I WILL. WITH OUR- MISTER A SENATOR WESSEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY JUST DIRECTION BUT SOME QUESTIONS TO MIKE MARTINEZ OF HIS. HE STILL OF THEIR PRESENT AND- IT'S- SPONSORED TO- SOME OF THE ACTIONS THE LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN IN RECENT YEARS TO RESPOND TO THE WILDFIRES INCLUDING- QUITE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT ADDRESS- FUEL- HANDLING OF FUEL OUT THERE IN THE SITE AND- HELPING TO. BOB PREVENT FIRES STILL HOLDING OUR UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE AND I REMEMBER GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS PROCESS THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE. CONSTERNATION FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THERE WAS AN ADMONISHMENT THAT WAS ISSUED TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING REVERSE CONDEMNATION AND SHOULD WE GO DOWN THAT PATH AND- THEN TRY TO. PREVENT THE PRACTICE OF INVERSE KIND OF IN A NATION AND AS FAR AS AS FAR AS THE PROCESS BY WHICH- NORMALLY- H. R. OUR WILDFIRE RELATED LOSSES ARE SETTLED- THEY BASICALLY WARNED THAT THAT IF THAT HAPPENED IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO UNDO THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION STRUCTURE OF THE WAY OUR OUR- OUR- LOSSES ARE ARE KIND OF FOREIGNER STATE. THAT INSURANCE RATES WOULD RISE- ENORMOUSLY AND THAT WOULD SEE LOSS OF COVERAGE OF COURSE WE DIDN'T GO THAT ROUTE. WE CHOSE TO GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AND NONETHELESS WE HAVE SEEN INTEREST RATES RISE AND- LOTS OF CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT AND WE'RE HEARING OF OTHERS THAT ARE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA'S. HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE SURE PROPERTY. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TRY TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE. WE HAVE TRIED TO. ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO. COMBAT FIRES TO PREVENT FUTURE FIRES HOLDEN ARE YOU TO CONTINUE TO HOLD. OUR UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE CREATING A FUND THAT WOULD HELP- OF OFFSET LOSSES. AND SO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES LARGELY HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED BUT THE RATES CONTINUE TO RISE IN SOME AREAS TRIPLE IN OTHER AREAS THEY DECIDED NOT TO COVER IT ALL AND THAT JUST GOES AGAINST- WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SEEMS REASONABLE IN THIS PROCESS SO- YOU KNOW MY QUESTION TO YOU AS THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN HAS BEEN- REALLY COMPROMISED WE NEED TO DO SOME CHANGES AS A LEGISLATURE WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE THERE. TO ADDRESS THE FAIR PLAN WE NEED TO MAKE INSURANCE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BUILD OUR STATE BECAUSE WE'RE FACING A FIRE CRISIS WE'RE FACING. A PANDEMIC WE'RE FACING A CALIFORNIA HOUSING SHORTAGE. AND AS PEOPLE ONE INVESTING CALIFORNIANS SAY WE DON'T WE CAN'T BILL HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. IT'S STARTING TO RING TRUE WHEN YOU THAT THEY- NOT ONLY. OF HAVE TO TAKE A RISK IN BUILDING THE HOUSING BUT ALSO RISK NOT BEING ABLE TO GET MULTI FAMILY INSURED AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR YOU TO DEVELOP THE HIGHER DENSE PROP. UP PROJECTS- WHERE YOU HAVE MULTI FAMILY THAT THEY SHOULD COST MORE THAN A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE SO MY QUESTION TO YOU GENERALLY AND IT'S AN INVITATION AND ALSO A QUESTION. I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHY ARE THERE ANY AREAS THAT- THAT THROUGH TO THE COMMISSION THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON ON THESE AREAS AND MAYBE EVEN POTENTIALLY- WORKING ON INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT'LL HELP- GUIDE OUR STATE THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS. FOR THESE THROUGH THE DIFFICULT TIMES THAT WE'RE IN. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE PANELISTS THAT WE HAVE LIMITED TIME IF WE CAN KEEP OUR ANSWERS CONCISE THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU CENTER HUESO A MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND I. ABSOLUTELY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. ALL OF THE- SUCCESSFUL CHAPTER LEGISLATION THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS MOVED FORWARD THESE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS THE- COMMITTEES BACKGROUND PAPER PROVIDES JUST A- SMATTERING OF A LIST OF. RECENT LEGISLATION TO TACKLE. ACCESS ATTICUS- AND- AND AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY OF INSURANCE. I WOULD SAY THAT. ABSOLUTELY WE BEFORE TO WE AT THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE AND SHORT I'M SORRY AND CERTAINLY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LADA WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE THAT- THAT YOU BOTH HAVE HAD AN AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO TACKLE ON THE SPACES YOU HAVE SEEN THE COMMISSIONER HAS BEEN ANNOUNCING A SERIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE. SOLUTIONS TO TACKLE WILDFIRE AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY AND THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL SPACE AND I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE TO PROVIDE A LISTING OF ALL OF THOSE ADMINISTRATOR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AGAIN UNDER HIS. EXISTING BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND HIM OF- PROVIDING- THESE OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE SOLUTIONS AND THEN IN PARTNERING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT TOO WE'RE ALSO HERE TO PROTECT THEM. AS WELL SO WE WILL ABSOLUTELY I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE TO AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ACTUALLY HAVE A- A LOT OF A DEPARTMENT AND COMMISSIONER CONVERSATION WITH YOU JUST OUTLINED- ALL OF THESE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. THANK GOODNESS MY NEXT WILL GO TO DI. THEY SHARE. FOR QUESTION IS FOR- ME MOORE TO. JUST QUICKLY- YEAH THE FAIR PLAN OBVIOUSLY IS A BIG BOON TO A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS BUT ALSO TO COMMERCIAL AND AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THEM ACTIVE IN THIS MARKET PLACE- FAIR PLAY HAS COME OUT WITH A- A STATEMENT TO- THEIR BROKERS- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT- THAT ARE. SOLICITING BIDS FOR THE FAIR PLAY AFTER THEY SAID THEY DO NOT WANT TO THERE THE INSURANCE COMPANY OF LAST RESORT WHICH MEANS IF YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE FAIR PLAN. WELL I'M GETTING JUST A CASE IN POINT HERE JUST EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT A BIT IT ON A- SMALL WINERY FOR EXAMPLE IN NAPA TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IS NOW THE PREMIUM. THE FAIR PLAN PREMIUM IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW GRANTED THE COVERAGES ARE THE SAME AS IN THE BENEFITS ARE BIT. LOOKING AT THE END OF THE DAY THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PREMIUM IS A NON. THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT THIS BAD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON INSURANCE SO I ASK YOU SIR- AT. DOES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE FAIR PLAN. IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN TALK- HE- TO- AND JUST KIND OF A- BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE FOR THE FAIR PLAN ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES OF THE MARKETPLACE. YES SENATOR DODD THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE. ABSOLUTELY WE DO SERVICE THE REGULATORY NOT. JUST INSURANCE INDUSTRY AB BUT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. AND JUST TO PROVIDE EVEN A BIT MORE I WOULD ACTUALLY ASK. MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN HENLEY WHO HAS SO TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE PROVIDED THAT MORE ON. THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATION OF THE FAIR PLAN. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ- AND SENATOR DODD THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION A BRIGHT IN THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. AND TO GET STRAIGHT TO YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIA PLAYER FAIR PLAN IS JUST AS YOU SAID THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT- ISSUE ALSO NOTED. THE FAIR PLANS COVERAGES MISTER MARTINEZ ALSO SHARED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS IS LIMITED SO THE PRICE OF THE PREMIUM THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED FOR COMMERCIAL POLICIES. IS LIKELY IN PART DUE TO THE LIMITS IN COVERAGE UP TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL COVERAGE AT THAT POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS ALL COVERAGES BIND SO. WORD FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES BE FAIR PLANS COVERAG IS LIKELY NOT TYPE OF COVERAGE THAT THAT BUSINESS OR THOSE BUSINESSES WILL MEET- SO THERE ARE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR PLAN OPERATES THE STATUTORY SYSTEM THAT. AUTHORIZES THE FAIR PLAN AND AUTHORIZES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO WORK WITH THE FAIR PLAN TO DEVELOP ITS PLAN OF OPERATIONS DOES CREATE LIMITATIONS AROUND THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE INSURED AS WE KNOW. FARM RISKS ARE CURRENTLY LISTED AS A AS A RESPECT CANNOT BE IN SHORT AS IT IS AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE SO THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF RISKS THAT BY STATUTE. EASTER PLAN CANNOT CANNOT COVER- AND OF COURSE WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYONE WHO HAS CONCERNS OR OR ONCE INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ON WHAT IT MEANS FOR A FARM RISK AND WHAT WHAT OTHER COVERAGES ARE INCLUDED BUT GENERALLY. COMMERCIAL BUSINESSESTHAT WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE FAIR PLAN CAN DO SO A MAJOR IS NOT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITS THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT. ON COVERAGE. AND SO WITH THAT THEY CAN INTEREST DOES HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF A STORY TO. WORK WITH EACH IF PLAN ADOPT A PLAN OPERATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR COVERAGE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS BUT AGAIN. SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE BY STATUTE EXCLUDED FROM FROM THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE COOPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ROGER I'LL BE QUICK ON THE NEXT ONE IF THAT'S OKAY FOR MR SECOND AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT- THE LACK OF LIABILITY INSURANCE IF NOT OUTRIGHT- PROHIBITS BUT DESCRIBED BURNING BY TRAINED. AND CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES- WE ALSO KNOW THAT BURNING. AND PRESCRIBED BURNING REDUCES THE POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOSIVE WILDFIRES IN TREATED AREAS. HE HAD. YOU KNOW WHY- PRESCRIBED BURNING REDUCES THE RISK OF MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES WOULD THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE OR REDUCE INSURANCE COSTS IN OTHER WORDS. HERE'S A- IT'S JUST INTO IT WE KNOW THE PRESCRIBED BURNING WORKS WE KNOW THAT IT REDUCES THE REST FOR- HOMEOWNERS AND EVEN COMMERCIAL IN IN YOUR CASE. COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES BUT YET WE HAVE THIS- DICHOTOMY THAT- INSURANCE COMPANIES AREN'T WRITING- POLICIES FOR- BURN BOSSES CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE. I COMPLIED WITH WHAT INFORMATION I HAVE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE ARE VERY FEW COMPANIES THAT WRITE IN THIS SPACE I THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SPACE TO WRITE IN A ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED IS THE LIABILITY THAT COMES OF THE FIRE. LEAVES A DESIGNATED AREA DEPENDING ON WHERE THE FIRES THAT RISK CAN BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL AND SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTS ON FOR FIRES THAT FOR SOME OF THE TIMBER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS WE ALSO NEED TO BALANCE THE LIABILITY RESTS AGAINST THE REST OF THE HOMEOWNERS AND THE INSURERS WHOSE PROPERTY MAY GET BURNED ON IT BACK IN A FIRE THAT DOES I WAS PRESCRIBED AREA. TERMS OF THE RIGHT TO RECOVERY BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AUTUMN BEFORE BECAUSE WE THINK IT IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR FORCE MANAGEMENT AND REMEMBER THIS. IN MANY CASES THE SECRET TO LOWER INSURANCE RATES IS TO LOWER THE RISK AND THIS COULD. BE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER DOT NET LOCAL TO. SAN JOE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR SURE MARTINEZ. BOTH MR MARTINEZ AND MR SEGMENT- MENTIONED IN THEIR COMMENTS YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH THAT COMMERCIAL INSURERS AND- IN THE FROZEN. APPROVAL RATES FOR FILINGS. AND AS A BOTH I THINK BOTH MENTIONED- INSURERS HAVE STOPPED RENEWING POLICIES IN WRITING NEW POLICIES IN THOSE. AREAS IT AND AS MR HUESO MENTIONED WE'VE GOT. MULTI FAMILY. YOU KNOW DEVELOPERS THAT WANT TO GET. PROJECTS BUILT AN INSURED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE- DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS STOPPED PROCESSING FORM FILINGS AND SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHY DOES HAVE BEEN STOPPED AND WINDU- PREDICT. GETTING THOSE PRODUCTS THAT PROCESS FOR THOSE FORM FAMILY STARTED AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES- THIS IS BRIAN HENLEY SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AND- AND- AS WELL AS WE ALL KNOW EACH YEAR- IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE WORLD. TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WAS A VERY UNUSUAL AND UNEXPECTED HERE. THE PANDEMICS HAS RESULTED IN. QUITE A BIG CHANGE IN THE RISK OF LOSS FOR A NUMBER OF LINES OF INSURANCE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS NATIONALLY. AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT AND HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONER LIVES HAS DIRECTED. FOR MANY LINES OF INSURANCE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES LOOK TO. AND CONSIDER THE CHANGE IN LOSS EXPOSURE AND THAT INCLUDES FOR COMMERCIAL LINES OF INSURANCE. COMMERCIAL LINES OF INSURANCE. FOR COMPANIES TO GO BACK AND REVISIT AND ANALYZED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR LOSS HISTORY HAS CHANGED INDEED JUST TODAY. A LOT OF ANNOUNCED YET ANOTHER BULLETIN TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. FOCUSING ON PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE DATA WHICH HAS SHOWN THAT IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS COLLECTED FOR PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE. AS LARGELY OUTSTRIPS THE AMOUNT OF LOSSES IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS FOR MANY LINES OF INSURANCE. COMMERCIAL LINES OF INSURANCE ARE NO EXCEPTION TO THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE. AND TODAY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LOT ALSO ANNOUNCED A DATA COLLECTION EFFORT TO REALLY GET AT THE VERY QUESTION. THAT YOU'RE ASKING. IT IS. WHAT LAW DID CARRIERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY OMITS THE PANDEMIC WHERE BUSINESSES WERE CLOSING- EXPOSURES IN LIABILITIES WERE DROPPING FOR MANY TYPES OF BUSINESSES AND SO THE COMMISSIONER HAS DIRECTED TODAY A DATA COLLECTION EFFORT TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE LOSS HISTORY WAS FOR BUSINESSES AND FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES COVERING THOSE BUSINESSES TO ASCERTAIN WHERE THERE ARE LINES OF INSURANCE OR PRODUCTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR WHERE RATES INDEED DO NEED TO BE RAISED VERSUS VARIAS WERE RATES ACTUALLY SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK DOWN MISTER LOTTE. IS VERY ACUTELY AWARE OF THE IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THAT HAVE BEEN HIT SO VERY HARD BY THE PANDEMICS AND THAT IS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES RAISE RATES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES WE FIRST UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR LOSS HISTORY LOOK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND SO THAT IS AN EFFORT WHICH CONTINUES TO WORK ON IT USED TO COLLECT INFORMATION TO HAVE A BETTER. ANSWER FOR AND UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS IN CALIFORNIA AND WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT TO DETERMINE WHERE BUSINESSES AND WHERE INSURANCE LINES OF PRODUCTS DO INDEED NEED RATES CREASES INCREASES FIRST WINES AND PRODUCTS WERE ACTUALLY PREMIUM SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THOSE. GUYS GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE OTHER MICRO. OF FIRST OF ALL ONE OF MAKE SURE TO THANK THE FROM FOR ALL HIS TO COME. AND GIVE US A SUCH AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION I ALSO WANT TO THINK MISTER SUTTON. AND WITH THAT WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. I WILL REMIND ALL PANELISTS AND MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE LIMITED TIME- DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES WE STARTED A LITTLE LATE SO LET'S. SEE IF WE CAN KEEP OUR PRESENTATIONS ARE UNDER FIVE MINUTES- AND WITH THAT I WILL FIRST. INTRODUCE OUR SECOND PANELIST ON A LEASE TO BOND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. FOLLOWED BY CLIFTON BROWN OF THE SURPLUS LINE ASSOCIATION AND JOHN NORWOOD. REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS AT LEAST WE WILL BEGIN WITH YOU ARE YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA. WILD TURN INSURANCE CRISES. THE FAIR PLAN REMAINS COMMITTED TO PUTTING OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO WORK WITH POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. AS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEERIGHT UP I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE ROLE OF THE FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN IS THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT FOR COVERAGE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET. AND IT'S NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE STANDARD PROPERTY COVERAGE LIKE HOMEOWNER'S COVERAGE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE FAIR PLAN IT CLEARLY DEFINED THIS NARROW PURPOSE FOR THE FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN PROVIDES BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE PRIMARILY FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND FIRE INSURANCE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. IN FACT THE INSURANCE CODE MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT TO COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE MARKET. COVERAGES OF THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT PROVIDE. ON THE DWELLING ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET SIMILAR TO HOW FLOOD AND EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE ARE ALSO READILY AVAILABLE ARE ALSO SUPPLEMENTAL COVERAGES. BUT WE'VE EXAMPLE THINK OF A HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH ONE WAY IN AND OUT IT HAS NO FIRE STATION NEARBY. TO HELP IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE. THAT HOUSE IS UNLIKELY THE PERSON OWNS AND HOUSES UNLIKELY TO FIND A FIRE INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. WHAT THE FAIR PLAN IS THERE TO PROVIDE FIRE INSURANCE FOR THAT RISKS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY OUR ROLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE PRIVATE MARKETS READILY AVAILABLE PROVIDE. OTHER COVERAGES IT'S JUST A FIRE PERIL THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN SUCH AN INSTANCE. WE DO GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON MY FAIR PLAN POLICIES CAN BE EXPENSIVE. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO JUST ADDRESS THOSE. THE FAIR PLAN IS A HIGH RISK POOL THAT PROVIDES COVERAGE TO THE HIGHEST RISK PROPERTIES. IN THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED. SO NOT ONLY ARE WE WRITING THE HIGHEST RISK PROPERTIES THE FAIR PLAN CANNOT CONTROL MORE SHOULD WEIGH THE CONCENTRATION OF POLICIES IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA. IT'S A FAIR PLANS ROLE TO BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS WHO CANNOT OBTAIN FIRE INSURANCE THROUGH THE PRIVATE MARKET. NOW IN ORDER TO PAY CLAIMS FOR THESE HIGHEST RESTS THE FAIR PLAN WAS CHARGED RATE COMMENSURATE TO ADDRESS. GENERALLY SPEAKING I'M OVER SIMPLIFYING HERE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING RATES ARE DEVELOPED TO COLLECT ENOUGH PREMIUM NOW. TO PAY FOR FUTURE EXPECTED LOSSES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE FAIR PLAN HAD. FIFTY EIGHT POLICIES IN THE STATE AND THE INSURED ONE STRUCTURE IN EACH OF THE STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THE POTENTIAL FOR WILDFIRE DAMAGING OR DESTROYING MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. RESULTING IN LOWER PREMIUMS NEEDED TO BE COLLECTED NOW FOR FUTURE LOSSES. HOWEVER THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT ALL FIFTY EIGHT OF THOSE POLICIES IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THE LIKELIHOOD OF A WILDFIRE DAMAGING OR DESTROYING ALL FIFTY EIGHT POLICIES IN THE SAME COMMUNITY. THAT PROBABILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN FACT THAT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR HIGHER PREMIUMS TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PAY THOSE MUCH GREATER LOSSES ANTICIPATED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE SO AGAIN THAT'S OVERSIMPLIFYING RIGHT MAKING BUT IN ESSENCE WE HAVE TO COLLECT ENOUGH PREMIUM TO TAKE TODAY TO PAY FOR EXPECTED LOSSES AND LOSSES IN MANY INSTANCES ARE DRIVEN BY THE CONCENTRATION OF POLICIES IN A PARTICULAR AREA. SO ESSENTIALLY AS THE FAIR PLAN POLICY CONCENTRATION GROWS OUR PREMIUMS WILL GO UP. WHICH IS WHY WE SPEND SO MUCH ENERGY WORKING ON SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE FAIR PLAN BECOME SMALLER. REDUCE CONCENTRATIONS AND REALLY ONLY BE THERE FOR POLICY HOLDERS WHO TRULY CANNOT SECURE NEEDED FIRE INSURANCE. AS STATED EARLIER. WELLINGS COVERAGES THAT THE FAIR PLAN DOESN'T WRITE ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE WHICH FOSTERS COMPETITION WHICH IN TURN IS GOOD FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO HELPING OUR TO REINCORPORATE POLICY HOLDERS FROM THE FAIR PLAN. BACK TO THE PRIVATE MARKET AND TO FACILITATE THIS- WE HAVE SUPPORTED THE FOLLOWING LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN RATHER- SPONSORED BY CINNAMON DALY. THIS IS A BILL THAT INCENTIVIZES INSURERS TO WRITE IN HIGH RISK AREAS. BY PROVIDING THEM RIGHT OUT CREDIT SO IN THE EVENT OF AN ASSESSMENT THEIR ASSESSMENT WOULD BE REDUCED IF THEY WRITE. PREMIUMS AND POLICIES IN THESE AREAS AND WE ALSO SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWELVE SPONSORED BY SOMEONE WOULD IN THE SAME ROOM AND DALY JUST LAST YEAR. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES US THE FAIR PLAN TO ESTABLISH A CLEARING HOUSE WHICH PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR FAIR PLAN FOR CHARACTER PLAN POLICY HOLDER TO TRANSFER TO A PRIVATE CARE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AT THE CUSTOMER'S CHOICE. BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DE POPULATE TO GIVE THE CUSTOMER THE CONSUMER MORE OPTIONS IN THE IN THE- MARKETPLACE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET PLACE. NOW NOT LOOKING BACKWARDS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AT THE FAIR PLAN ON OUR DWELLING POLICIES. WE GREW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DWELLING POLICIES BY. 20% OF THE INSURER INITIATED HOMEOWNER'S POLICY NON RENEWALS. NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS. 80% OF THE POLICYHOLDERS WHO WERE NON RENEWED BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY WERE ABLE TO SECURE INSURANCE ELSEWHERE THE BAD NEWS IS THAT 20% COULDN'T AND THEY CAME TO THE FAIR PLAN. IT WELL THAT'S ENCOURAGING THAT MARKET WE STILL HAVE- A WAYS TO GO THEM THE MARKET IS STILL NOT. WRITING AS MUCH AS WE AT THE FAIR PLAN WOULD LIKE HIM TO BUT AGAIN WE'RE SUPPORTING LEGISLATION AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO. COME UP WITH MORE CREATIVE IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I JOKINGLY SAY PRETTY REGULARLY I WORK IN OPPOSITE WORLD- I PROBABLY RUN THE ONLY COMPANY THAT REALLY. THE SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY. A SHRINKING PORTFOLIO AND A SHRINKING CUSTOMER BASE- BECAUSE THAT IS ACTUALLY A SIGN OF A VERY HEALTHY VOLUNTARY OR- PRIVATE MARKET. AT THE MOMENT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND I KNOW A LOT OF WORK IS BEING DONE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND AS LONG AS THE NEED IS THERE FOR SHARE PLANS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY OUR ROLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FINDING SOLUTIONS AND THAT PRIVATE MARKETPLACE SUCH AS ASSEMBLY WILL EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN AND ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWELVE. AND SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO MAKE THE FAIR PLAN THE SOLUTION. IN THE FAIR PLAN WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE THE SOLUTION THE FAIR PLAN IS IN FACT A SAFETY NET. AND A THE INSURER OF LAST ENORMOUS RESORT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A SAFETY NET FOR THE IMAGE FOR THE- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CLIFTON BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LINE ASSOCIATION I THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ANTI PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS CLOSED BROWN AND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS WITH THE SURPLUS LINE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND- VICE CHAIR JONES AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF YOU TODAY. ON WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LINES MARKET PLACE. TO START I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO. THE SURPLUS LINE ASSOCIATION WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND IT WAS APPOINTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS A SURPLUS LINES IN PRICE REPORTING LOCATION. IN THIS ROLE WE REVIEW EVERY SURPLUS LINE POLICY FILED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THE BROKERS COMPLY WITH ALL PERTINENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ARE SIX THOUSAND LICENSED BROKERS. PLACED APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND POLICIES WITH A TOTAL PREMIUM OF ELEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE UP FRONT. BUT STATE LAW GIVES THE ADMITTED MARKET THE RIGHT OF REFUSAL BEFORE PROGRESS CAN BE PLACED ON THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. SURPLUS LINES BROKERS BY CALIFORNIA LAW CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE MILITARY OR FOR BUSINESS AND MUST PERFORM A DILIGENT SEARCH FOR AN ADMITTED CARRIER THAT WILL COVER RISK. BEFORE PLACING THAT POLICY IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. IN SOME INSTANCES ADMITTED INSURANCE WILL MAKE A BUSINESS DECISION NOT TO COVER A PARTICULAR RISK. WHAT CLASS OF RISKS THESE ARE USUALLY IN CASES OF NEW. COMPLEX DISTRESSED. OR HIGH CAPACITY RISKS. IN THE WHOLE MARKET THURMOND REASONS TO MANY AREA MAY REDUCE SOCIAL. FOR INSTANCE IT MAY IT MIGHT FIND THAT IT IS TOO CONCENTRATED IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR THE RISK PROFILE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED DUE TO FORCES BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT ACTION. IN THESE CASES CONSUMERS NEED OPTIONS WHERE THEY WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT THE INSURANCE COVERAGE THEY NEED. RETAIL AGENT WORKING WITH THE SURPLUS LINES BROKER CONSUMERS CAN SEE COVERAGE ON THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN COVERAGE WHERE THEY CAN GO TO THE FAIR PLAN TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN COVERAGE THERE. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF RISKS THAT GO INTO SURPLUS LINES ARE COMMERCIAL HOMEOWNERS CAP ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF SURPLUS WILL BE BREAKING UP. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HOMEOWNERS AND HOMEOWNERS MULTI PERIL INSURANCE IN PERSONAL LINES ACCOUNT FOR BETWEEN ONE POINT THREE AND TWO POINT 2% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS SURPLUS LINES PREMIUMS. EVEN AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HOMEOWNERS PREMIUMS HAS INCREASED THIS IS HAPPENING JUST A BACKGROUND OF INCREASED BUSINESS IN THE OVERALL SURPLUS LINES MARKET. I'M CONCERNING COMMERCIAL LINES WHICH MAKE UP THE LION'S SHARE OF SURPLUS LINES CONVERGING CALIFORNIA TRENDS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE SHOWN A STEADY INCREASE- PART OF THIS IS DUE TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES SUCH AS THE SHARING ECONOMY AND ECONOMISTS VEHICLES AND NEW LINES OF BUSINESS CREATED BY LEGAL CHANGES SUCH AS THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WHICH ARE CREATED MORE BUSINESS FOR THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET PLACE. ADDITIONALLY WE DO SEE A STEADY INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND LIABILITY AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT% THAT BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 18% OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE CALIFORNIA IS WRITTEN IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET. MANY LINES OF COVERAGE WRITTEN A SURPLUS LINES INCLUDE BOTH PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE BUT AMONG COVERAGE LINES THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE TO BE LARGELY COMMERCIAL. TOTAL PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED STEADILY APPROXIMATELY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ROUGHLY SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY. OVER THAT TIME THE NUMBER OF- POLICIES AND COMMERCIAL LINES HAVE ALSO STEADILY INCREASED FROM ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. TO OVER SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY. TRENDING COMMERCIAL COVERAGE CORRESPONDS ROUGHLY WITH THE OVERALL INCREASE AND SURPLUS LINES BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA OVERALL DURING THAT TIME. AND SURPLUS LINES BUSINESS OTHER STATES THE TRACK THESE TRENDS HAVE SEEN SIMILAR INCREASES DURING THIS TIME. AND ALL OF THESE CASES THE SURPLUS LINES INDUSTRY IS FILLING A ROLE THAT IS NOT BEING SERVED BY THE ADMITTED MARKET WHICH IS EXACTLY THE ROLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ENVISIONED FOR INDUSTRY. OUR PURPOSE IS NOT TO SUPPLANT THE IMMINENT MARKET. RATHER WE ARE HERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO CONSUMERS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE COVERAGE THEY NEED. A FAIR PLAN OR OTHER RESIDUAL MARC MARKETS EXIST TO OFFER UP COVERAGE OPTIONS WE NEED TO BE ADMITTED MORE SURPLUS LINES MARKETS COME ON. UP WHAT ARE MEMBERS ARE SITTING IN THE MARKET PLACE CURRENTLY. IS A HARDENING MARKET. HASN'T MEDICARE'S PULL BACK IN LINE SUCH AS HOMEOWNERS. MORE OF THOSE RISKS ARE COMING INTO SURPLUS LINES AND CREATING MORE DEMAND RELATIVE TO SUPPLY. A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBERS WILL BE ASKED ABOUT ISSUES OR CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE MARKETPLACE. DID BRING UP HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE IN THE DECREASING APPETITE FOR THIS LEARN INSURANCE. AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET AS WELL. ADMITTED INSURERS OFTEN BRING UP THEIR INABILITY TO CHARGE RATES APPROPRIATE TO THE GROWING RISK. FOR THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET CONCERNS INCLUDE REGULATORY GUIDANCE ON NON RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS BEING OPPRESSED YOU BOTH THE MAN AND NOT A MILITARY. IN THE INABILITY TO FACT IN MODEL UN RIEN COSTS ALSO A CONCERN THIS MEMBERS. THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET LAW BECAUSE OF THE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AFFORDED TO SURPLUS LINES- TO PUT IT PLAINLY NO COMPANY GOES INTO BUSINESS TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AT THE END OF THE DAY DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OFFER COVERAGE COME DOWN TO THE ARITHMETIC OF WHETHER INSURANCE COMPANY CLAIMS. AND MAKE CONSUMERS HOLE. IN CLOSING THE SURPLUS LINES INDUSTRY PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHO CANNOT OBTAIN COVERAGE IN THE AMOUNT OF MARKET. CAP OPTIONS TO ENSURE THEIR PRIMARY AGAINST ACTUAL LOSSES. OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE IN RESPONSIBLE ONE SURPLUS ONE INSURANCE MARKETS THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU HERE TODAY OF OUR INDUSTRY'S ROLE IN ENSURING A HEALTHY FAIR AND COMPETITIVE INSURANCE MARKET FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA MR NOT WOULD GET TO SEEYOU YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA- CREATES OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING. THE INVENTORS AGENTS ASSOCIATION CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF LICENSED AGENTS AND BROKERS BROKERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IN YOUR DISTRICTS. ARE MEMBERS PLACES GREAT MAJORITY OF COMMERCIAL AND WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE WRITTEN IN THE STATE I PROBABLY HAVE TO ABOUT 30% OF THE PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE. FOR PERSONAL LINES ARE MEMBERS RIGHT WITH SOME OF THE LARGEST HOMEOWNERS INSURERS LIKE LIBERTY MUTUAL SAFECO NATIONWIDE MERCURY BUT ALSO PLACE BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN NINETY OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WRITING HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OR AT LEAST. USED TO BE RUNNING HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE. I DISAPPOINTED IN A TOWN HALL MEETING THIS WEEK WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED OF OUR MEMBERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF INSURANCE- ON THE THIRD VARIANCE IN CURRENTLY. OUR MEMBERS DESCRIBES THE CURRENT SITUATION. FACING THEM AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. AS UNPRECEDENTED AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE MANY OF MEMBERS COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE GENERATIONAL OR PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS ALL THEIR LINES. IN ADDITION TO CONCERNS ABOUT KEEPING OUR OWN AGENCIES VIABLE THE VERY CONCERNED AND WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THEIR CLIENTS CAN FIND INSURANCE TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE TO GIVE. GIVE AWAY THE BUSINESS TO A COMPETING AGENT OR BROKER TO FIND COVERAGE. REPORTS WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE ONLY A COUPLE OF ADMITTED INSURERS WRITING PROPERTY INSURANCE IN ALL OF A TRIAL IN THE NORTHERN AREAS. THE MARKET IS VERY RESTRICTED IN NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES IN SAN LUIS OBISPO AND REALLY IN ANY OF THE WINE PRODUCING AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. INSURANCE FOR PROPERTIES AND AREAS OF SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY AND CARMEL STREATLEY RESTRICTIVE AZ'S INSURANCE AND COMMUNITIES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IN ANY HOUSING THAT IS CLOSE TO CANYONS. THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BILL AFFORDABILITY HOME OR INSURE IS NOW. IN WITHIN A OR TWO OF DOESN'T NEED A BRUSH AREAS. IN A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED THERE ARE REACHING CAPACITY REPLACING INSURANCE SOME AMOUNT OF MINUTE MARKET. WITH REGARD TO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE OUR MEMBERS CONFIRMED THAT THERE AREREAL ISSUES WITH FARM AND RANCH PROPERTIES WITH WILDFIRE AND BROUGHT YOUR EXPOSURE. PARTICULARLY THOSE INCLUDE VINEYARDS WINERIES SO CALLED HOBBY FARMS AND PROPERTIES WITH EXPENSIVE HOMES AND OUTBUILDINGS. OUR MEMBERS COMPLAINED THE FAIR PLAN LIMITS FOR YOUR PLAN LIMITS FOR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ARE TOO LOW. AND THERE'S NOT A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY REALLY AVAILABLE FOR THESE COMMERCIAL RENTS. IN ADDITION THE FAIR PLAN WILL NOW NOT RIGHT RESS CAN OBTAIN A QUOTE FROM A NON ADMITTED INSURERS EVEN THOUGH THE PRICE IS SUBSTANTIALLY. HIGHER I THINK MISTER DODD. MADE REFERENCE TO THAT. AFFORDABILITY IS BECOMING A HUGE ISSUE WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE LOOKING AT HOMEOWNER'S POLICY PREMIUMS ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO GO. WE'VE HEARD LEAST ONE SUCH WHERE ALLEGE FOR FAMILY. FORCED PLACED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS. WHICH INSURER WITH THE INSURER CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT FORECLOSURE. ALSO PROBLEMATIC THIS PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR YOUTH CAMPS CONFERENCE CENTERS RETREATS OUTDOOR EXPLORATION EXPLORATION FACILITIES OWNED BY NON PROFITS THEY HAVE THEY HAVE ANY EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE. OR OR WITHIN A MILE OF DOESN'T NEED A BROCHURE IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED OF THESE PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS OWNED AND OPERATED BY NONPROFITS. MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES HAVE FACILITIES VALUED IN THE MILLIONS OR EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH MEANS FAIR PLAN LIMITS ARE INADEQUATE. IN ADDITION IT'S BEEN REPORTED THE PLAN INSTITUTIONAL TARGETS ON THESE PROPERTIES SO THE USER INSUREDS AND USED TO PAY TEN TO TWENTY CENTS PER HUNDRED IN PROPERTY VALUE FOR INSURANCE ON OUR PAYING. FIVE DOLLARS PER. HUNDRED FOR INSURANCE IF THEY CAN EVEN FIND. WHAT OF THE THINGS OUR MEMBERS REPORT IS ALTHOUGH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS BAN ON NON RENEWALS IS PROVIDING SOME RELIEF IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED WILDFIRES. THIS REPRIEVE IS ONLY TEMPORARY. THE SIDE EFFECT IS THAT IS CAUSING INSURERS TO NON RENEW PROPERTIES IN AREAS ADJACENT ZIP CODES DOESN'T MEAN FOR NON RENEWAL TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE IN THESE REGIONS. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THESE INSURERS REDUCING EXPOSURE DUE TO THE COST OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE REINSURANCE. WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY AT LEAST ONE ENSURE THAT IF THEY WISH TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT PROPERTY. INSURANCE EXPOSURE THE REINSURANCE COSTS WOULD DOUBLE AND THEY WILL LIKELY LEAD WILL LOSE SOME OF THEIR REINSURANCE PARTNERS. AS IT TURNED OUT THE COMPANY DID LOSE SOME OF THEIR REINSURANCE PARTNERS EVEN WITH A REDUCTION. IN THEIR ENSURE PROPERTIES. WE REALIZE THERE'S NO MAGIC IS GOING TO GET US ON THIS CRISIS THIS IS GOOD FIFTY YEARS IN THE MAKING. HOWEVER WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO EXTEND COVERAGE TO THE FAIR PLAN FOR FARM AND RANCH POLICIES. I WOULD EVEN GO SO FAR AS SUGGESTING REQUESTED GOVERNOR HE ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING THIS CHANGE AND ALLOW THE PLAN TO FILE AND USE RATES. FIND ACCELERATE THERE WILL. TO ENTER THE STREET. THE SAME COULD BE DONE WITH INCREASING THE COMMERCIAL LIMITS OF THE FAIR PLAN UP TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS. BOTH OF THOSE CHANGES COULD BE FALL WITH IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION. WE'RE ALSO SUGGESTS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER CONSIDER ALLOWING INSURERS TO OFFER POLICIES WITH A WILDFIRE DEDUCTIBLE. UNDER SUCH A POLICY THE HOMEOWNER WOULD HAVE A REGULAR OR LOWER DEDUCTIBLE FOR ONE OFF EVENTS BUT A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES MAYBE TWENTY FIVE TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRES. THIS WOULD BOTH REDUCE INSURANCE EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE LOSSES. WHILE LOWERING THE COST OF INSURANCE FOR THE CONSUMER- WE ALSO FEEL THERE IS A LOT OF PROMISE CONTAINED IN THE I'M NOT BILL LAST SESSION AB TWENTY ONE. SIXTY SEVEN WHICH PASSED COMMITTEE WERE WERE ENCOURAGED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE INSURERS ARE ACTIVELY DISCUSSING THESE CONCEPTS FROM A REGULATORY APPROACH YOU KNOW SOMEONE DEVELOPS. LASTLY WE WOULD APPLAUD THE SENATE BLUEPRINT FOR A FIRE SAFE CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THE SHIRTS COMPANIES ARE MEMBERS RIGHT WITH ARE DEPENDENT ON SUPPORT FROM REINSURERS. ALL REINSURANCE MARKET IS COULD SCARED OF THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE RISK AND WHO CAN BLAME- HOWEVER. THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO APPROVE. IN TOTAL WORLD REINSURANCE COMMUNITY SEES REAL RESULTS IN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE STATE. AS SUCH WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE- WILDFIRE BUDGET ITEMS IN THE ELEMENTS OF THE BLUEPRINT FOR A- SAFE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER NARAL- NOW GO OVER TO MEMBERS- ANY QUESTIONS I SEE MISTER DODD. SENATOR DODD. YES THE FIRST THE FIRST QUESTION IS ADDRESSED TO- TO- MISS JIM ON THE FROM THE FAIR PLAN AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER- MISTER NOR WATER MISTER BROWN COULD ASK ANSWER THIS QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OWN INDUSTRIES. SO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE WORD IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAP PRIORITIES ON FIXING THE PROBLEM THERE'S LOTS OF BILLS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH- IN IN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THEY'LL BE BILLS ARE COMING THROUGH THIS YEAR. NONE OF AMMAR THE SILVER BULLET BUT ALL OF THEM KIND OF WORK LIKE A PATCHWORK QUILT OF. YOBE BILLS THAT- WILL REALLY HOPEFULLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN YEARS TO COME SO I ASKED THIS QUESTION WE KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING MORE MORE PRESCRIBED BURNS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE GOT TO ADVANCE EVEN MORE. WE KNOW THAT HOME HARDING IS REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT IN THIS BUDGET EARLY ACTION MONEY ADD YOUR- AND MORE EVENTS- DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE KNOW THAT A HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE. CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT HOMES EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN WITHOUT THE- DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE ALSO ARE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON IRE REDUCTION ASSETS PRE POSITIONING ASSETS IN THE- YOU KNOW DURING THE FIRE SEASONS. SO I ASKED FIRST TO- MYSTERY BONTA. HILL IS THERE A WAY FOR THE FAIR PLAN TO REALLY THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. AND TRY TO RECREATE YOURSELF RECREATE THE FAIR PLAY AND DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. WHERE WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMERCIAL PARTICULARLY FARMS AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES. ARE A REALLY GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET- AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. AND STEP UP AND FIND A WAY OR TELL US. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING HERE TO GIVE YOU THE TOOLS TO FIGHT IN THE WAY OF PROVIDING THAT PROTECTION FOR THESE ENTITIES. THAT WE FOUND WHEN WE FIRST CREATED THE FAIR PLAN FOR RESIDENTIAL. CUSTOMERS SENATOR THIS IS ONLY THE JOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE FAIR PLAN IS ACTUALLY- LIMITED HI. THE INSURANCE CODE WE CANNOT TODAY RIGHT FARM RISKS AND QUITE FRANKLY YOU COULD ARGUE IN THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE COULD CERTAINLY HELP WE'VE GOT SENATE BILL ELEVEN OUT THERE WHICH- WOULD PERMIT US TO DO SO TODAY OUR HANDS ARE TIED IT'S NOT A MATTER OF THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. WE ARE LITERALLY PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CODE I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO TAKE THE STUFF WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FARM BUREAU SINCE THIS ISSUE CAME TO OUR ATTENTION. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE EAGER TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE FAIR PLAN IS IN EXISTENCE FOR. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME FOLLOW UP MISSPELLING CHAIR ABSOLUTELY- I APPRECIATE THAT DIRECT RESPONSE INDIAN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I GUESS- WHAT I WAS REALLY THINKING OF ITS- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WHITE A WIDER REDEFINITION IS NOT NECESSARILY. FARM IS THAT YOUR- INTERPRETATION. WE HAVE- THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THAT. AND UNFORTUNATELY LAWYERS- I I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS THE U. S. DA. IT WAS A IT WAS A FEDERAL- DEFINITION THAT A WINERY IS CONSIDERED A FARM SO AGAIN THAT FURTHER TIES OUR HANDS. WHICH IS WHY WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE- CHANGING THE LAW SO THAT WE CAN WRITE FARMS THAT WE CAN OFFER THAT SOLUTION. AND YOU'VE DONE MORE- I THINK PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT THIS FRANKLY THAT A LOT OF US. YOU KNOW HERE BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN SQUARELY PUT ON YOUR LAP- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ALSO DONE BY EXECUTIVE ORDER- OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR- TO GIVE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER I'M SORRY TO BE SO YOU'RE IN THIS AREA JUST NEVER. HAD ANY EXPERIENCE. HONESTLY I'M NOT CERTAIN OF THE ANSWER THAT MR MORE. CERTAINLY BROUGHT THAT UP BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE RULES ARE SURROUNDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THOUGH SENATOR JOHN IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD I UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY THAT SOMETHING IF IT WERE POSSIBLE. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. BUT ABANDONED. BUT I ALSO ASSUME IF THE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THE BACKGROUND WORK AND MAYBE YOU'RE DOING IT NOW BECAUSE- ALL THE SUDDEN YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE THESE PERILS WITHOUT THINKING. ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MORE MONEY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AS A BACKSTOP IN THE EVENT OF RISK AND- ALL THOSE THINGS WARD IT GIVE MY ROD IS ARE PLENTY OF ASSETS. THERE TO BE ABLE TO- CHARGE THE APPROPRIATE RATES AND ACCEPT THE RISK. I'M TODAY SENATOR DODD NO DON'T HAVE THE ASSETS I BELIEVE WHAT MISTER NORWOOD WAS RECOMMENDING WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ALSO INCLUDED FILING USE. WHICH COMPLETELY SPEEDS UP OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THIS. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER DOT THINK ENEMIES AND I HAVE A QUESTION FRONT AND AT LEAST THE FAIR PLAN AS WELL AND I WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO MISTER DODGES- STATED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REINVENT THE FOR PLAN TO REALLY COINCIDE WITH US SUCH UP IN INTEREST YOU TIME AS IT PERTAINS TO THE OFF HOURS AND HOW WE'RE SEEN CHANGES ACROSS THE STATE- I DO HAVE SB ELEVEN WHICH IS A BILL. THAT- YOU KNOW WHEN WE INTEND TO ADDRESS SOME OF. FIRST RANCHERS GRAPE GROWERS SO I JUST WANT YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE. OR HOW IS YOUR BUSINESS GOING TO CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS. BILL DO YOU THINK THAT THE- THE COSTS WILL GROW SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE OTHER. FAIR PLAN CUSTOMERS. I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR RUBIO OF THE PRICING WOULD NOT AFFECT FOR EXAMPLE THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE IT SAYS IT'S A COMMERCIAL LINE OF BUSINESS SO THE PRICING WOULD BE WITH AND THE COMMERCIAL- PRICING. MARKET IF YOU WILL SO WOULDN'T IMPACT THE- INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER OR THE DWELLING POLICY PREMIUMS PER SE NOW- CLEARLY WE NEED TO DO SOME WORK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RATE IS AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE FORMS ARE. BUT YOU KNOW I'M ACTUALLY OUT QUITE INTRIGUED BY WHAT SENATOR DODD AND MR NOR WOULD- BOTH PASSED- SUGGESTED AND ASKED ABOUT- THE PROCESS AND I BELIEVE I HEARD THIS EARLIER FROM MISTER SECOND THE PROCESS OF GETTING COMMERCIAL FILINGS APPROVED. IT IS A IT'S NOT A SPEEDY PROCESS- I CAN SPEAK FOR THE FAIR FINALLY HAD A COMMERCIAL FILING IN PLACE SINCE JULY OF LAST YEAR- HOWEVER EACH IF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IF THAT AVENUE WERE POSSIBLE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. IMMEDIATELY GET ON AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH WE RECOGNIZE. THE NEED FOR THIS AND THE URGENCY OF THIS. BUT AGAIN TO SOME DEGREE OUR HANDS ARE TIED SO- WE WOULD MAKE IT WORK AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THIS IS OUR ROLE IN THE MARKET PLACE. WHICH IS WHY WHEN THIS WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION WE WERE ALL OVER IT SO- I AM I AM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU WITH SENATOR DODD WITH EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTION FAST WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AT THE FAIR PLAN. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CHEROKEE WE HEAR FROM- MISTER NORWOOD ON THAT ON THIS ISSUE SEE IF HE HAS ANY ANY THING IN ADDITION. ABSOLUTELY MISTER NORWOOD IS THERE ANY COMMENTS I. STAVING ONE OUT TO THIS CONVERSATION. SURE OF THE GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE. I THINK IN EXCESS OF FIFTY EXECUTIVE ORDERS CHANGING SOMETHING LIKE FOREIGN FIFTY STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA- SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN MORE COMPLEX THAN CHANGING A FEW WORDS TO THE FAIR PLAN STATURE- YOU KNOW IN. IN LEASE CORRECTLY IN THE JOB EVEN IF THEY GOT A FORTY IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO HAVE. FORMS AND FILINGS BUT THAT'S THE REASON FOR ALLOWING THEM TO DO A FILE AND USE FOR TERRY OF TIME MAYBE SIX MONTHS OR SO BEFORE THEY HAVE TO GET SOMETHING INTO THE APARTMENT. THANK YOU REALLY JUST DO IT COPYCAT FILING WITH ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT WRITE TODAY IN THAT SPACE- AND THEN GET UP AND RUNNING. SO I THINK THAT'S- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I CAN I CAN SEE I DON'T SEE ANY REASON NOT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR TO PARTNERS CLAWS ON SB ELEVEN WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. BUT. I THINK I THINK IT'S A POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT THEY MUCH ABOUT FOR YOUR- SO I WANNA TAKE WOMAN TO. I'M A LEASE- FIFTEEN BROWN INTO NORWOOD FOR THIS. EVER AS- SO I THINK YOU ALL- NOW ARE TO MOVE ON TO OUR- OUR THIRD PANEL. AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO START TODAY WITH BY LAYING OUT QUINN DAVISON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. MISTER ROBERTS SPIEGEL REPRESENTING THE FARM BUREAU. BEING LAST AND I THINK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE TODAY I WILL START WITH THAT MRS QUINN DAVISON- YOU MAKE IT BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO JOIN US HEARING I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS LAYING IT COULD BE THE SENATE AND I AM A FIRED VISOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FIRES CONSOLE AND I'VE WORKED ON FIRE RELATED ISSUES FOR THE LAST. TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS. SHARE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW I KNOW WE'VE BEEN. ABOUT IT QUITE A BIT DURING THIS. BUT IT'S THE USE OF. AND RELEASED THIS CONDITIONS PREDETERMINED CHECKED. AND IT'S WELL KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE AND IN A SMALL. WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY CAN BE USED TO MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS. FOR A WHILE HIGHER RISK PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS MOST AFFECTED FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS. ARE THOSE THAT INCLUDES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT% FIRE NOT ONLY. THE AND FUTURE WILDFIRE BUT ALSO TO DROUGHT INTO. RANCHERS OTHER LAND PRESCRIBED FIRE IT'S COOL TO REALLY I MEAN. AND IT'S CLANCY. NEED AMERICAN BURNING IS IN TO THE ULTRA. AND THE REASON AND TRADITIONS ACT WATCH KNOWLEDGE. TIME WITH THE NEED FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE REALLY IS LONGER IN CLASS ARE FEDERAL STAGE ARE SETTING THIS TARGETS AND THERE'S NO A BIRD CRAFT MOVEMENT AROUND THE STRIKE HELLO. RESTRUCTURING HE OTHER LET PROGRAMS. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE GETTING READY TO WATCH THAT NEW SPEAKS FOR FROM WHICH WOULD MEAN BY CALL SIX AND TWENTY AND HAS JUST BEEN. ANDREW THIS WE WILL SEE SORT OF HIGH EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS PLAN AND WE ON STATE LANDSTRASSE. IN SHORT IS A REALLY LITTLE CRIME OF FIRED- THE OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT IN IF GAIL OF THIS IMPORTANT- BUT SIRIUS CHIU REMAIN AND THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT FACE THE FRONT. YEAH ARE. SOUNDS REASONABLE BUT IN PRACTICE IT'S A VERY SUBJECTIVE STANDARDS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AND DISCOMFORT IN THE WORST CASE WHICH IS KIND OF THE MOST COMMON AREA THESE INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS DECIDE NOT TO USE PRESCRIBED FIRE BECAUSE OF COURSE RESCUES HIGH. THE LIABILITIES A CERTAIN. CASES WORKING DECIDE TO THE FOR WITH FIRE THEY OFTEN WITH OR HOW INTENSITY THAT INSURANCE AND WORK AGAIN THIS IS A IS. OF A LOT LAW AND PERCEIVED THREAT. INSURANCE CRITICAL OF THIS PUZZLE AND I THINKRECEIVED BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A TO NOTE THAT RECORD OF FIRE I'M A MEDICINE IT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY. FOUND IN THIS REYES OF LESS. ACTUAL UNFORTUNATELY AT THE SAME TIME ALL THIS MOMENTUM BUILDING ROCKETS FIRED CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE INCREASINGLY DECIDED NOT TO COVER THESE ACTIVITIES THANK YOU FOR EARLIER IN THIS HEARING AS ONE EXAMPLE THE WATERSHED CENTER AND SHOULD BE COUNTY HAS BEEN LEADING COOPERATIVE FOR STRUCTURE FIRE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND THE TREATED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF STRATEGIC PROJECTS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NAY FILED A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES DECEMBER RESOURCES WITHIN ONE OF THEIR PERMITTED BURN UNIT AT THE REQUEST OF THE LAND. AND UPON EVEN AT A FAIRLY MINIMAL CLAIM THE WATER CENTERS POLICY WAS CANCELED NOW DESPITE HAVING QUALIFIED FOR BOSTON STAFF AND SOME OF THE MOST ROBUST RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES IN PLACE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PURCHASE A NEW POLICY IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING WHICH TIME THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE FIRM EITHER BY THIS INCREASE COSTS ON OLDER TRANSLATION THIS VERNE WINDOWS AND OVERALL JUST INCREASE THE QUANTITY AND GET THEIR MONEY MOST RECENTLY THEY WERE INFORMED THAT THEIR CURRENT POLICY WILL BE CANCELED ON MAY FIRST THIS YEAR. AND DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED BRING PROGRAMS WITHIN THE NONPROFIT CALIFORNIA EVEN UNABLE TO FIND INSURANCE ON THE PRIVATE MARKET AND THEIR WORKS RELIEF INSTALL ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IN THAT KIND OF WATER CITY COUNCIL HUMBLE COUNTY WHICH IS I USUALLY REPUTABLE AND- TRUSTED PROGRAM AND THEY LOST THEIR LAWYERS BROAD FORM INSURANCE COVERAGE IF POLITICALLY TWENTY JUST AS THEY WERE ONBOARDING THEIR NEWLY HIRED FEDERALLY QUALIFIED. FOR AS A RESULT IT MARK THEIR GRANTS TO SERVE A PRIVATE FIRM. MANY OF WHOM ALSO LOST. JAMES AND THEN THE CONSERVANCY IS ONE OF THE FEW. NGOS. BYE BYE QUALIFIED AND- INSURED BURN BOSS. BASICALLY HAVE TO HOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY GET YOUR- AND- THAT CAUSES TO MISS A LOT OF POTENTIAL DAYS. AND BRING BRING BOSTON THE AREA ALSO TRUST ISSUE FOR THE CAN AND I REALLY HE'S FAST. I'M SURE ONE MORE THING IS THE MY PRIDE CONTRA WHO ALSO. QUALIFIED BOSS IN HIS CASE HE'S BEEN TOLD HIS AND AGE IS. ARC BUT HE'S REALLY BEEN IN TO GET THAT RIGHT. USE SHOULD HE THAT THEY CANCEL THE POLICY IF YES ME. THESE ALSO CERTAINLY YOU HIS POLICY WOULD CANCELED IF WE EVER HAD FILE A CLAIM. HE SAYS HE REALIZES THE A WALK ON ICE BUT A RISK SMALL AND- THE BELIEVES. FOR HIM BECAUSE HE'S WORKING SYSTEM AS A HELLO. CONTRACTOR IS ONE OF THE FOUR AND PRIVATE PLAN BY AVAILABLE TO THIS WORKING CALIFORNIA NOW AND HE'S ABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR HIS. EXPERT WE ALL YOUNG ACROSS. EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATING. THE POSED BY LACK OF. INSURANCE IN THE SUBJECT BE LESS CERTAINTY OF THE STATE. PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR THE NEED FOR. AND THIS IS WHY I AM SUPPORTIVE OF STANDARDIZED RECENTLY INTRODUCED SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY TWO REGARDING LIABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA C. CERTIFIED BOXES AND ALSO WHILE I WENT IN FOR A STATE HAVE YOUR YEAR TO DATE AND SECURE YOU ALL TALKING ABOUT THIS WEREALLY NEED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE SOLUTIONS. FOR I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE I MOVE FORWARD- SOMEONE WHO'S ON REMOTE LINE HAS ANOTHER DEVICE ON WE WOULD KINDLY ASK THAT YOU TURN IT OFF OR MEET YOURSELF THANK YOU. NEXT E WILL MOVE ON TO ROBERT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. A PIECE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ROBERT SPIEGELMAN ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND OF THE STATE'S FAMILY FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND AS AN ORGANISATION WE ADVOCATE ON NUMEROUS ISSUES IMPACTING THE FAMILY FARM AND RANCH. SO IS PROVIDED IN THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND- CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL FARMS AND RANCHES ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRULY UNPRECEDENTED- INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ISSUE. CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL FARMS AND RANCHES ARE LOSING INSURANCE COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED WILDFIRE ACTIVITY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS UNFORTUNATELY THE DATA AS TO HOW MANY FARMS AND RANCHES ARE LOSING INSURANCE COVERAGE IS ONLY ANECDOTAL. SO WE HAVE NO TRACKING DATA EIGHT AVAILABLE TO FULLY ASCERTAIN. THE DEPTH OF THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE SOME DATA FROM ABROAD MEMBERSHIP ARE PARTNERS WITH OUR INSURANCE BROKERS- THAT ENSURE FARM PROPERTIES. AND TO pFIVE HUNDRED FARMS AND RANCHES IN THE NAPA SONOMA COUNTY REGION AT LOS COVERAGES DOZENS MORE MONTEREY COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL COAST. MOVING FURTHER SOUTH IN CALIFORNIA THE COUNTIES OF VENTURA SANTA BARBARA RIVERSIDE ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO ARE SEEING DOZENS OF FARMS AND RANCHES LOSE COVERAGE- LOSE THEIR INSURANCE COVERAGE IN FACT AS FAR NORTH AS MODOC COUNTY INTACT. ACTUALLY I HAVE BEEN RECENTLY INFORMED THAT WE HAVE RANCHERS LOSING COVERAGE ALL THE WAY UP AND ALTARIS. AS WE HAVE SEEN CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES HAVE ENCROACHED UPON AGRICULTURAL LAND WITH INCREASING REGULARITY AND INTENSITY AS AN EXAMPLE THE TWENTY TWENTY ALLEN YOU CON- LIGHTNING COMPLEX FIRE IN CLASS FIRE IN NAPA COUNTY IT'S BECAUSE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN DIRECT AGRICULTURAL DAMAGES TO PROPERTY. AND AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE LOSSES HAVE EXCEEDED ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE VINEYARDS ORCHARDS GRAZING LANDS AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND LIVESTOCK BEING COMPLETELY KILLED ANDERSON. AND WERE DESTROYED. SO WELL DIRECT FINING LOSS TAG. AND FIRST. SELDOM REACH THE LEVEL FINING LOSS THAT WE SEE. A IN THE CASE OF WILDFIRE DAMAGES TO OTHER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IT DOESN'T MAKE THE SITUATION ANY LESS DIRE. IT'S NOT THE TOTALITY OF FINANCIAL LOSS IT IS CONCERNING LET'S BE CLEAR IT IS DEFINITELY TO AN EXTENT CONCERNING. BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN CAPTURED IN THE GREATER INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ISSUE AND DRAMA THAT'S THE FOLLOWING MANY RESIDENTIAL AND OTHER COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN THE STATE. SO WITH WILDFIRE RISK AND THE DAMAGES TO PROPERTY HAD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE INSURANCE MARKET HAS RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY TO THAT RISK HOWEVER. THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR COMMERCIAL FARM AND RANCH WHEN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET TAKES STEPS TO REDUCE THE RISK PORTFOLIO. NOW IF YOUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL POLICY HOLDER YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIFT TO OTHER CARRIERS OFFERING SIMILAR COVERAGE OR FIND COVERAGE VIA CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. AND THIS HEREIN LIES A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM. WHY IF THE FARMER RANCHER FONG. A SIMILAR INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REPLACE THE POLICY THAT WAS NOT RENEWED. WELL QUITE OBVIOUSLY THE FAIR PLAN IS THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT EXCEPT WHEN IT ISN'T AND WHEN EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW FAILS TO EXPLICITLY PROVIDE. THE ABILITY OR AVAILABILITY FOR COMMERCIAL FARMS AND RANCHES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM THAT'S THE FOLLOWING MY INDUSTRY AND MY MEMBERS TODAY. THE FARM AND RANCH INSURANCE POLICIES HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE NON RENEWED AND THE REASON A BACKSTOP FOR THE COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. SO TAKING A STEP BACK YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE THE FARM WHAT ARE WHAT IS OUR WHAT OUR FARM AND RANCH INSURANCE POLICIES AND WHAT HE'S POLICY COVERS HOW DO THEY WORK. AND THIS IS REALLY THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I'VE HAD TO ANSWER OVER THE LAST TWELVE TO FOURTEEN MONTHS. ENTER PARAPHRASES. IT TO SIMPLIFY IT. THE FAMILY OPERATED FARM OR RANCH TYPICALLY HAS. A VARIETY OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY. THIS CAN BE FOR A QUICK NAP BY SAKE BUILDINGS- THE LOSSES HOWEVER CAN COME FROM THE PERILS THAT AFFECT ANY OTHER KIND OF BUSINESS OR PROPERTY AND THESE CAN BE FIRE SLIGHT STATURE. WHICH REALLY IN MOST SIMPLY A FARM INSURANCE POLICIES ARE R. RANCHO POLICIES ARE KIND OF LIKE A HYBRID. THEY CAN COMBINE STANDARD COVERAGES OFFERED BY A PERSONAL HOMEOWNERS POLICY WITH COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE. AND THE BENEFIT OF THE FARM POLICY IS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO THE NEEDS OF FARMERS. FOR EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF FARM LIABILITY VERSUS COMMERCIAL LIABILITY. INSURANCE INDUSTRY TREATS THIS IN A MANNER WHERE THE INSURED IS GROWING FRUIT OR RAISING CATTLE. AND THEY'RE SELLING THE ROCK COMMODITY IN UNADULTERATED FORM. THIS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WHAT IS CALLED THE FORMALIZED ALREADY COVERAGE FOR. HOWEVER ONCE THE INSURED. ALTERS THE FORM OF A COMMODITY. LIKE CATTLE BEING SOLD PREPACKAGED BEEF. THIS IS CONSIDERED A COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE SO THEREFORE THE FARM WOULD NEED A COMMERCIAL LIABILITY POLICY. IN PLACE TO PROPERLY COVERED SELL THE PACKAGE BEEF. SENT OUT FOR FARM PROPERTY IT'S A LITTLE SIMPLER. ANY FARM BUILDING THAT IS USED FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITY OTHER THAN FARMING. IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE FARM PROPERTY POLICY FOR. EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A MACHINE SHOP ON THE FARM AND THE SHOP IS RENTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO USES TO SHOP TO OPERATE A MECHANIC BUSINESS. THE INSURED WOULD NEED A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FORM SINCE THE ACTIVITY IS NOT CONSIDERED A FARMING OPERATION BUT A BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THEN OVER LAYING ALL THIS TO FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS. WE HAVE ANOTHER ELEMENT OF INSURANCE FOR FARMS AND RANCHES AND THAT'S CROP INSURANCE. AND CROP INSURANCE IS A SPECIALTY LINE OF INSURANCE SOMETIMES SEPARATE FROM A FARMER RANCH POLICY BUT NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY NECESSARILY THE CASE. AND THAT IS PURCHASED BY AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER. TO PROTECT AGAINST EITHER THE LOSS OF CROPS DUE TO. NATURAL DISASTERS FOR LOSS OF. REVENUE DUE TO CLIENTS ARE DUE TO DECLINES. IN THE PRICE OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. SO NOW. TO BRING THIS REALLY FULL CIRCLE. CALIFORNIA FARM CAL. FAR AND RANCH ARE LEFT IN LURCH. PRACTICAL PROPERTIES ARE PRONE TO EXIT THE SAME REST. IS ALL OTHER RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME NON RENEWALS IS ALL OTHER POLICY HOLDERS. THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FARMER THE RANCHES UNABLE TO ACQUIRE THE COVERAGE OF LAST RESORT DUE TO STATE LAW. SO THE SOLUTION AND NOT NECESSARILY THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. IS TO CLARIFY THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN IS AUTHORIZED TO UNDERWRITE POLICIES FOR AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY. BY PROPERTY I MEAN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO THE LAND. AND UTILIZED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY. VERY BROAD DEFINITION WHAT ENCOMPASSES ALL AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS ALLOWING FARMS AND RANCHES AND WINERIES AND DAIRIES HAVE BASIC PROPERTY INSURANCE. THERE AND IN MOST CASES. THESE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS CAN THEN STAFF OR LAYER ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGE IF NEEDED ON TOP OF THE FAIR PLAN POLICY TO FURTHER MITIGATE THEIR OWN RISK. THE SOLUTION IS WHAT THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS. MY ORGANIZATION APPRECIATES THE SON GOT ON GOING DIALOGUE THE NEGOTIATION TO FIND REALLY A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. SENATE BILL LEVIN IS THE VEHICLE THAT ENCOMPASSES THESE DISCUSSIONS AND WE'RE EXCITED THAT- THE CHAIR HAS MADE THIS BILL ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES THIS YEAR. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS WE FURTHER DISCUSS THE APPROPRIATE MEANS TO ADDRESS OTHER INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. ALL IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INCLUDED TODAY- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR SPIEGEL I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MEMBER QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL GO TO MISTER DOT.

THANK YOU SENATOR DODD- FOR ME I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK- THE PANELISTS AT MRS QUINN DAVIS AND JUST FOR CERTIFYING BURKE BOSSES BUT SOMETHING THAT SHE SHARED WAS STRIKING TO ME- SHE SHARED THAT THERE WERE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND BURNS. THAT RESULTED- IN ONE ONE LAWSUIT AND I GUESS THERE IS AN ISSUE OF MISS. PERCEPTION HERE BECAUSE- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE MR DOG AND I HAVE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH IN TERMS OF WHAT'SNEEDED BUT THAT INFORMATION WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR AND WE APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR SPIEGEL BECAUSE- I CLEARLY ARE YOU DON'T COMMERCIAL FARMS ARE STRUGGLING AS WELL AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN. TAKE THE INFORMATION WE'VE LEARNED HERE TODAY TO HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS A YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A BACKSTOP IN TERMS OF INSURANCE SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR INFORMATION HERE FOR BEING PANELISTS HERE TODAY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M ERIN I THINK YOU'RE AMERICAN BANKING A TREE CARE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE ASSOCIATION HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COMPANY OF. THAT WORK IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING A COUPLE OF LARGE RECOGNIZABLE NAMES SUCH AS DAVEY TREE AND RIGHT CERVANTES CORPORATION. I'VE YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE INCREASE DEVASTATING DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON YOU I HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TREE CARE COMPANIES HAVE SEEN THEIR LIABILITY INSURANCE PREMIUM. INCREASE AT THE SAME TIME THE COVERAGE IS ACTUALLY DECREASED WITH THESE CHANGES DEEPENING FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. COMPANIES WORK IN A PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT OF THESE COMPANIES OFTEN CONTRACT WITH OUR COMPANY TO ENSURE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION LINES ARE FREE FROM BY TH PATIENT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OUR COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO DO ONGOING IMPORTANT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMITTEE. AS PART OF THE SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NEXT WILL BE A LINE. FOURTEEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR VICE CHAIR JONES MEMBERS MICHAEL GUNNING HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE- I WANT TO GO ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE PRESENTERS FOR ILLUMINATING THE NAME ISSUES WE'RE TALKING- REPRESENTS THE- STATE'S APPROXIMATE THREE THOUSAND. AND HOME BUILDERS AND LAND DEVELOPERS IN THE HOLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING HAS TO DO WITH A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING SPECIFICALLY A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS AND THE COST OF A COMMON AREA PROPERTY INSURANCE- SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FINDING IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO ENSURE THEIR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS. WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE TO ADDRESS A HOUSING SHORTAGE WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING IS THAT THIS HAPPENS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT PROJECTS MEET AND EXCEED THE CURRENT ESTABLISHED WHAT FIRE SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS. AND MAY EVEN BE PART OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE ON NEW POLICIES FOR MULTI FAMILY COMMUNITIES. IN LIGHT OF THE FIRE RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT TODAY. I THINK IT'S LIKE AARON SUGGESTED CONCERT DOUBLING TRIPLING BEING DROPPED- RAISED WITHOUT. NOTICE WHAT YOU OF THIS OF COURSE AND WE ARE KNOW THE IS AFFECTING SENIOR LOW INCOME IN THE- SOME POTENTIAL HOME. SO WHILE WE COMMEND THE PART WITH COMMISSIONER LAW AND THE NEW AMENDMENT. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE RISKS IN WE THINK THAT THE SOLUTION OKAY COME OUT OF THAT. I THINK WE WANT TO ECHO. MISTER COMMON ABOUT AND USE THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE RATE FILINGS ARE NOT BEING APPROVED. AND WE NEED TO GET SOME GREAT OUT HERE SO INSURERS CAN BEGIN TO ENSURE AGAIN SO WITH THAT I'LL STOP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR AND NEXT PLEASE. NEXT THE. TWENTY FOUR. WITH THERE ARE AT LAW LET JERRY THIS IS THERE ARE A LOT WITH INTRINSIC INSURANCE SERVICES I'M A BROKER IN THE AREA THAT SPECIALIZES IN THE HIGHSPIRE RASH AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING BY TALKING TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THAT THERE IS NO CURRENT PUSH FOR THEM TO COME OUT WITH ANY D. IC FILINGS FOR COMMERCIAL ON FARMS. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT NECESSARY COVERAGE THROUGH AND- CALIFORNIA PLAN. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT AS IT IS LOOKING AT THE INSURANCE CODE IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S STATED ON HERE WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT WAY. THE WILL IS THERE THAT LOCK THOSE LAWS CAN BE OVERTURNED FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THIS IS DEFINITELY TURNING INTO THAT. SO WE NEED TO JUST LIKE PROP ONE OH THREE WITH UNENDING GENDERS WE NEED TO MAKE IT SO THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE ICY FILING THAT THE PORTANTINO COMMERCIAL ON FARMS. AND THEN EXTRADITED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT WE DON'T END UP IN A REACTIONARY NOT THAT LIKE WE DID WITH THE HOMEOWNER'S POLICIES. WE THERE'S A LOT OF STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN WE KNOW THAT WE GET THIS THROUGH- RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW WE GOT HERE THAT HE KEEPS CATCHING ON FIRE. WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT COURSE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH SOMEBODY SOLUTION. TO HELP GET THEM BACK ON THE MARKET. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT NEXT CALLER. NEXT DEADLINE. TWENTY SEVEN. RUBIO MEMBERS THIS IS CHRIS ROSA ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- WILD FIRE EXCLUSION- WILDFIRE EXCLUSIONS ARE BECOMING THE NORM WHEN INSURANCE POLICIES ARE UP FOR RENEWAL SO IN ADDITION TO SKYROCKETING RISING PREMIUMS OUR MEMBERS ARE BEING TOLD THAT DESPITE ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING TO MITIGATE. THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL FIRE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR REGULAR TIMBER HARVEST THE OPERATION THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS EXCEEDED ITS CAPACITY FOR WILDFIRE RISK AND THEREFORE WILL NOT OFFER WILD FIRE COVERAGE DESPITE THE LOW RISK PROFILE OF OUR MEMBERS SHOW UP EQUAL IMPORTANCE IS THE LACK OF LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING ACTIVITIES AS YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE OR GOOD FIRES AS WE CALL THEM IS FRONT IN CENTER IN DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING FOREST HEALTH. AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCY HOWEVER DESPITE ALL OF THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND THE GOALS OF INCREASING THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT'S LAID OUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE COURSE RESILIENCY ACTION PLAN IT'S UNLIKELY THAT COMMERCIAL OPERATORS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WILL EVEN BE ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL OF PRESCRIBED FIRE WITHOUT ACCESS TO IMPORTANT LIABILITY COVERAGE. SAID AGAIN THE PROBLEM OF INSURANCE FOR PART CRIED FIRE IT'S OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR PRIORITIZATION. AT THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMPIRE NECK CALLER. NEXT DEADLINE.
