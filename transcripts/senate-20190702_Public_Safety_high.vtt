DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:05.130

AND EDUCATED ON THIS PARTICULAR

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.101
TOPIC I WANT TO BE CLEAR

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:21.713
THE RIGHT.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.150
APPROACH -- DA O'MALLEY SAYS

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:27.152
THAT IT FOCUSES ON THE PURCHASER

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.287
HOWEVER MY CONCERN IS THAT WE

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.556
HAD SEVERAL LAWYERS REVIEWING

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.192
THE BILL AND IS CLEARLY SUBJECT

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.461
TO MISINTERPRETATION IF THAT WAS.

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:38.430
THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.898
SPONSOR.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.233
WE DO BELIEVE IT'S WELL

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:42.934
INTENTIONED THE BILL IS NOT

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.069
NECESSARY.

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.570
THERE'S A MYRIAD OF STATUTES

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:47.139
PROVIDING PUNISHMENT FOR

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:49.408
COMMERCIAL SEX ACT AS WELL SEX

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:51.777
ACTS AS WELL AS USING PAYING OR

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:53.745
EMPLOYING MINORS TO COMMIT

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.647
COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:57.816
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL --

00:21:57.883 --> 00:22:00.385
ABOUT PENAL CODE SECTION TWO

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:01.453
THIRTY SIX POINT ONE SUBDIVISION

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.990
C. BUT IT DOES COVER THESE ACTS.

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.526
AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT IT COULD

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:10.062
CRIMINALIZE BEHAVIOR THAT ARE

00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:12.531
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE

THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME.

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.278
PROSTITUTES BECAUSE THEY CAN

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:28.313

ONLY SUGGESTED AMENDMENT THAT WE

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:03.755

GREATER A LARGER LOOPHOLE I DID

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.231

CURRENT GOVERNING STRUCTURE I

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.402
WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE THIS

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.471
BILL SO IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS NOW

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:21.006

EVERY SINGLE DAY IN

UNFORTUNATELY AS WE KNOW

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:29.047
CALIFORNIA IS A HUB FOR HUMAN

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:30.048
TRAFFICKING.

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:31.983
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATUS

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.786
QUO IS CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.621
WHICH IS WHY WE WANT TO CONTINUE

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:37.889
PUSHING THIS BILL.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.025
FOR AND TO WORK WITH THE NEW

00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:44.629
ADMINISTRATION I TO ADDRESS THIS

YES I I'M FOR ME.

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:51.636
I AGREE THAT THE LAW IS VERY

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:53.271
STRONG AGAINST TRAFFICKERS I

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.773
DON'T AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS OF

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.775
THE TEENAGERS BUT AS SOMEONE WHO

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.176
HAS LOOKED AT THESE CASES FOR

00:27:58.243 --> 00:27:59.477
PURPOSES OF CHARGING.

00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.479
I CAN SAY THAT I'M FOCUSED

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:04.416
PRIMARILY ON FOURTEEN TO

00:28:04.482 --> 00:28:05.650
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WHO

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.485
ARE BEING SOLICITED.

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.154
BY PURCHASERS THAT THE

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.655
PUNISHMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.357
SOLICITS FOR SEX FOR COMMERCIAL

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:15.160
SEX IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:16.394
ESSENTIALLY NO TIME ATTACHED.

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:17.762
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:20.298
ADULT SOLICITING AN ADULT SEX

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.200
WORKER FROM AN ADULT WHO'S

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.501
SOLICITING AND LOOKING FOR ITS.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:25.737
VERY SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:26.438
TO BUY.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.940
THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.241
POPULATION.

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.142
AND THERE IS NO OTHER BILL

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:33.511
BESIDE SIX FORTY SEVEN BE A IN

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.879
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS A BILL

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:35.947
THAT I SPONSORED.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:38.183
BROKE SIX FORTY SEVEN BE THE ONE

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:41.052
SOLICITATION STATUTE IN THE LAW.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.188
BROKEN INTO THREE SUBSECTIONS A

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:45.590
WAS THE THE NUMBER ONE ADULT

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.625
SOLICITING TO SELL BE WAS AN

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.060
ADULT SOLICITING AN ADULT SEX

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:50.728
WORKER AND SEASON ADULTS

SOLICITING A MINOR.

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:53.131
BUT THE PUNISHMENT IS NOT

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:53.998
DIFFERENT.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.367
AND WE KNOW THE BEHAVIOR AND THE

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.803
THE MENTALITY OF THE PURCHASER

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.305
TROLLING OUR STREETS OR TROLLING

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.340
THE INTERNET SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.208
CHILDREN.

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:05.110
IS A VERY DIFFERENT THAN ADULT

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:06.744
WHO'S ENGAGING IN ADULT SEX

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.947
WORKER SO THIS BILL IS THE ONLY

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:11.716
BILL RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD EXIST.

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:14.953
TO ADDRESS THOSE PURCHASERS.

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.254
AND GIVE PROTECTION FOR THOSE

IS NOT ABLE TO SIGN AWAY THEIR

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:06.556

EVERY DAY AND TO THINK.

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:26.094
AS THE ASSOCIATION HAS WORKED

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.763

THEY WOULD ACTUALLY FACILITATE

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.540
THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.041

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:43.979
THERE'S NO BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.747
WILL STAND BY THE WORD SO THAT'S

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:46.648
THE REASON WHY THIS BILL IS

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:48.083

01:52:42.455 --> 01:52:48.795
KIND OF SYSTEM -- AND SO.

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:50.763
IT IS TRAGIC THAT SOMEONE ON

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:27.400
PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT WERE

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:29.068
BEGINNING TO CREATE A CULTURE

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.803
SHIFT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOW

01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:32.105
THEY EXPERIENCE.

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:34.374
THE GOVERNOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.242
COMMITMENT TO MOVE DEPARTMENT OF

01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:38.044
JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:39.879
CORRECTIONS INTO.

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:41.614
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS A

01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:43.082
NOTHER.

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:48.755
CULTURE SHIFT SIGNAL -- AND SO.

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:49.822
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THOSE

01:53:49.889 --> 01:53:51.491
THINGS FOR MY COLLEAGUES AS

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:53.493
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- KIND OF

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.695
WHAT IS VERSUS WHAT I TO BE ON

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:57.163
AND THE CULTURE THE DIRECTION WE

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.899
ARE HOPING TO GO IN THE STATE.

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:03.136
AND SUPPORTING NOT ONLY JUVENILE

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:05.305
OFFENDERS.

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:06.573
BUT THOSE WHO.

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.174
ARE PERHAPS AT RISK ARE THOSE

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:10.243
WHO ARE PERCEIVED BY THE ADULTS

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:12.178
IN THEIR WORLD TO NEED SOME KIND

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:13.680
OF SUPPORT INTERACTION.

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.682
AND WE NEED TO CREATE SYSTEMS IN

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.350
WHICH THAT SUPPORT COMES FROM

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:20.920
PLACES OTHER THE AND PROBATION

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:22.789
IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:54:22.855 --> 01:54:24.090
ON THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT THAT

01:54:24.157 --> 01:54:25.091
THERE IS A ROLE FOR PROBATION

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.926
WELL I MEAN I PERSONALLY AGREE

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:28.561
WITH THE DIRECTION THE PROBATION

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:29.929
HAS GONE IN RECENT YEARS.

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:31.331
I GET THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:32.899
PROBATION BUT THERE'S ALSO A

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:35.435
ROLE FOR SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE

AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:06.292
WAS GOING ON THERE'S SOME

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:07.694
EVIDENCE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.861
GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS.

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:09.862
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:10.930
WAS REAL CONCERN FOR LA COUNTY

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:12.765
IN THE REST THE STATE.

01:56:12.832 --> 01:56:13.866
IS THAT THERE IS AN CLEAR

01:56:13.933 --> 01:56:15.668
SUPERVISION OR OVERSIGHT OR

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:16.502
COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE OF THESE

01:56:16.569 --> 01:56:18.237
PROGRAMS IT WAS ALSO USING JJ

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:19.806
CPA MONEY THAT WAS ATTENDED FOR

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.107
COMMUNITY.

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.576
BASED PREVENTION SERVICES -- AND

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:24.610
SO IT WAS THROUGH AN AUDIT AT

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:25.678
THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT THE

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:27.880
PROGRAM WAS EVEN THE IDENTIFIED

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:30.450
AS EXISTING -- SO NO ONE IS

01:56:30.516 --> 01:56:31.751
TOTALLY SURE HOW LONG WAS GOING

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:32.752
ON BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:33.820
FOR A MORE THAN A DECADE

01:56:33.886 --> 01:56:39.659
POSSIBLY AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN OR

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:41.160
TWENTY YEARS IN DIFFERENT FORMS

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:41.461
[inaudible]

01:56:41.527 --> 01:56:44.063
HI.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.165

SANCHEZ MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:48.067
OUT.

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:50.036
LA COUNTY IS 25% OF THE

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.571
POPULATION OF THE STATE AND SO

01:56:51.637 --> 01:56:53.706
THEY ARE MEMBER OF COURSE OF

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:55.508
YOUR ASSOCIATION.

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:02.648
WORKING LA COUNTY.

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:03.349
SO SPEAK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:04.183
GLOBALLY STATEWIDE THERE'S

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.918
EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS -- STATEWIDE

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:08.221
THAT ARE UNDER KIND OF THAT THAT --

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:08.855
CODE SECTION FIVE PERTAINING TO

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:10.056
THE EARLY INTERVENTION AND

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.090
PREVENTION TYPE PROGRAMS -- I

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:12.258
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF

01:57:12.325 --> 01:57:14.093
WHAT IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.428
BILL IS THE DIFFERENCES AND

01:57:15.495 --> 01:57:17.463
COUNTY RESOURCES DYNAMICS THAT

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:18.431
THAT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:20.066
RESOURCE THE SAME WAY AND SO WE

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:21.634
WANT TO OF COURSE MAKE SURE --

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.069
THAT PROGRAMS -- PROGRAM

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.737
DELIVERIES DESIGNED IN A WAY IN

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.372
WHICH AND SOMETIMES IT IS --

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:27.507
PROBATION WORKING IN

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:29.075
COORDINATION ITH -- COMMUNITY

01:57:29.142 --> 01:57:30.209
BASED ORGANIZATIONS OTHER TIMES

01:57:30.276 --> 01:57:31.277
IT'S WITH PUBLIC HEALTH

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:32.044
EDUCATION SOMETIMES IT'S

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:33.413
PROBATION OFFERING THE DRUG

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:34.981
SERVICES A PROVISIONS BEEN

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:36.582
TRAINED EXTENSIVELY IN TRAUMA

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:38.785
INFORMED CARE -- AND MANY OF THE

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.086
APPROACHES THAT I THINK WE ALL

01:57:40.153 --> 01:57:41.120
TALK ABOUT AND WANT TO SEE

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.222
HAPPEN AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:44.524
THAT THOSE -- THOSE TYPES OF

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:46.259
RECKONING RECOGNITIONS I THINK

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:48.261
ARE BUILT ON INTO THIS BILL AND

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:49.762
SO I AM AS I MENTIONED WE HAD

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:51.297
COME KIND OF TO THE TABLE EARLY

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:53.199

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:04.610
THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR OPEN

TO THOSE ADDITIONAL CHANGES --

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:07.547
BECAUSE WE AGAIN I THINK WANNA

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:08.815
WORK WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.416
BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THE

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:14.921
INTERVENTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:15.521
IN THE WAY THAT WE ALL WANT TO

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:16.355
SEE THEM HAPPEN.

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:17.723
THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:18.024
[inaudible]

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.726
CERTAINLY -- WE WILL NOT BE

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:21.461
TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN THIS

01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:22.728
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT CAN BILL

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:24.730
HAS TO GO TO EDUCATION AND WE

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:26.098
DID NOT HAVE THE MINUTES TO

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:27.200
RECOMMEND BUT CERTAINLY IF THE

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:28.434
AUTHOR.

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:30.870
IN -- IS.

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.605
LOOKING AT ANY THAT IS THE PLACE

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:33.806
TO DO THAT.

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:36.175
I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL AND

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:40.213
I FEEL THAT -- WELL THERE MAY BE

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.148
SOME VERY GOOD PROGRAMS EITHER

01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:44.250
WITHIN OUR DI DA OR PROBATION

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:45.485
DEPARTMENTS.

01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:48.421
IN GENERAL AS OF BOTH THE AUTHOR

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:51.090
AND SENATOR MITCHELL EXPRESSED.

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:53.993
I DON'T THINK THAT.

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.395
EITHER PROBATION WERE THE THIS

01:58:56.462 --> 01:59:00.533
IS AN THE PROBLEM OF STUDENTS

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.268
NOT GOING TO SCHOOL.

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.036
IF THEY'VE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:06.072
SHOULD NOT BE DEALT WITH.

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:09.375
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARENA.

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:13.379
AND BEGIN WITH APPRECIATION THAT

01:59:13.446 --> 01:59:14.647
THERE ARE.

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:18.451
THESE EFFORTS -- AND IF I LOOK

01:59:18.518 --> 01:59:20.353
AT FOR EXAMPLE OAKLAND UNIFIED

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:22.622
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE KNOW THAT.

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:25.157
THE ISSUES AROUND AS STUDENT

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:26.993
BEING TRUANT OFTEN OCCUR VERY

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:28.427
VERY EARLY THEY KERR FROM

01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:29.795
KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE.

01:59:29.862 --> 01:59:32.265
SO THERE WAS SOME RESEARCH DONE

01:59:32.331 --> 01:59:33.766
BECAUSE OAKLAND HAD A VERY HIGH

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:35.601
TRUANCY RATE IN KINDERGARTEN AND

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:37.303
FIRST GRADE.

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:39.338
AND THE CHECKED AND WHAT A

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:42.708
DEFINED -- UST DOES NOT PROVIDE

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:43.509
A SERVICE.

01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:45.044
AND THE PARENTS OF THESE

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:47.280
CHILDREN EITHER HAD SUCH WORK

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:48.714
SCHEDULES THAT THEY WERE UNABLE

01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:50.216
THEMSELVES TO GET THEIR CHILD'S

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:51.484
SCHOOL.

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.619
WHERE THEY HAD -- DISABILITIES

01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:56.389
OR OTHER ISSUES AND SO IT WAS

01:59:56.455 --> 01:59:58.391
BASICALLY PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

01:59:58.457 --> 01:59:59.625
FOR THEM TO GET.

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:00.993
THEIR STUDENT TO SCHOOL.

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:03.029
AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT DIDN'T

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:05.398
PROVIDE ANY RESOURCES TO GET THE

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:05.965
KIDS TO SCHOOL.

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.833
SO THESE SOME OF THESE THINGS

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.603
ARE REALLY THINGS THAT WE NEED

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:14.006
TO ADDRESS IN A IN OTHER WAYS.

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:18.311
AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:00:18.377 --> 02:00:21.414
AUTHOR BRINGING THE BILL --

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:21.981
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE ANOTHER

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.549
COMMITTEE TO GO [inaudible]

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:28.354
TO AND THE WE'LL SEE HOW THE

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.156

OKAY GREAT THREE OF MOTION WOULD

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:35.461

CONVERSATION ON THIS MATTER --

02:00:39.865 --> 02:00:41.934
JUST LET ME SAY TO MISS THOMAS --

TESTIMONY I THINK WAS VERY

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:46.038
COMPELLING -- THAT'S REASON WHY

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:47.773
WE HAVE THIS BILL HERE TODAY AND

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.742
CONTINUE TO BE -- A VOICE FOR

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:51.444
THE VOICELESS IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:53.546
AREA -- THIS IS A BILL THAT I

02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:55.581
THINK THAT IT WILL BENEFIT OUR

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:22.601
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LANGUAGE

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:24.536
IN THE CONTEXT OF THREATS TO

02:07:24.603 --> 02:07:26.505
SCHOOL CAMPUSES OR HOUSES OF

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:28.374

SOMEONE ELSE.

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.544
THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO COMMIT

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:34.680
MASS MURDER AT A SCHOOL OR HOUSE

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:35.781
OF WORSHIP.

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:36.882
THE PERSON THAT RECEIVES THAT

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:38.884
COMMUNICATION MAY NOT BE IN

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:42.287
SUSTAIN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE.

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:43.655
OR THE LIVES OF FAMILY MEMBERS

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:44.990
IN MOST SCHOOL SHOOTING

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:46.759

PLANTS ALTHOUGH THAT PERSON MAY

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:50.963
NOT.

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:53.132
AND LIKELY WAS NOT INTENDED AS A

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.533
TARGET OF THE THREAT.

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.369
SUCH VAGUE ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:07:57.436 --> 02:07:58.871
STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:00.639
IS IN ADEQUATE TO THE GRAVITY OF

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.508
THE KINDS OF THREATS AB NINE OH

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.410
SEVEN ADDRESSES OR LAW SHOULD BE

02:08:04.476 --> 02:08:06.345
QUICK CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL IN

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:07.946
SPECIFYING WHAT CONDUCT IS A

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:12.684
INTERPRETATION.

02:08:12.751 --> 02:08:14.186
OF APPELLATE COURTS.

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:15.954
AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD END THE

02:08:16.021 --> 02:08:18.657
AB ACUITY OF WHETHER PC SECTION

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:19.291
FOR TWENTY TWO IS LEGALLY

02:08:19.358 --> 02:08:20.926
SUFFICIENT TO CHARGE THE

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:22.061
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE THESE

02:08:22.127 --> 02:08:23.862
RECKLESS IRRESPONSIBLE LIFE

02:08:23.929 --> 02:08:25.097
ENDANGERING THREATS.

02:08:25.164 --> 02:08:26.832
THAT STATES WITH CLARITY THE

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.434
ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO CHARGE THE

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.902
CRIME OF THREATENING A SCHOOL OR

02:08:29.968 --> 02:08:31.003
PLACE OF WORSHIP.

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:32.571
IT ALSO GIVES PROSECUTORS THE

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.239
ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:35.908
SERIOUSNESS AN ATTENDANT

CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH A THREAT

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.344
AND DECIDE WHETHER THIS CONDUCT

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:41.613
AMOUNTED TO A MISDEMEANOR OR A

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.481
FELONY.

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:43.549
AB NINE OH SEVEN IS A REFLECTION

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.117

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:46.185
IN WHICH WE LIVE.

02:08:46.251 --> 02:08:47.686

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:01.587
AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF AND

AS DISCUSSED -- IN THE TESTIMONY

THE THREATS COVERED UNDER THIS

BILL CAN ALREADY BE PROSECUTED

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.262
UNDER EXISTING LAW WE WOULD

DISAGREE WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:14.766

02:11:19.838 --> 02:11:21.540
ACTION AYE I THINK THAT THE

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:23.242
COURTS HAVE SPOKEN AND AND IT'S

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:24.810

THEY MAKE THESE KINDS OF THREATS

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.417
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:35.020

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:36.455
BECAUSE THE BILL HAS BEEN PASSED.

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:37.789

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:51.470

GO DOWN VOTE IN ENERGY.

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.309
SO APOLOGIES ARE WOULD CONTINUE

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:59.778

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:01.346
MAKE ONE COMMENT.

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:05.083

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:15.894
CONSIDER.

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.963
BECAUSE IT RIGHT NOW THIS WOULD

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.499
MAKE IT A WAFFLER -- SO THERE'S

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:22.200
DISCRETION WHICH IS GREAT BUT I

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:24.803
WONDER IF WE MIGHT CONSIDER

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:26.872
HAVING FOR MINORS BE A

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:27.205

VOTE.

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:36.581
AND WE COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:42.120
THE CONVERSATION.

02:12:42.187 --> 02:12:43.422

ASSOCIATION WE DO LIVE IN

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:50.696
EXTREMELY PAINFUL TIMES WITH

02:12:50.762 --> 02:12:52.931
WHITE SUPREMACISTS ATTACKING

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.633
CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES AND

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:56.001
MOSQUES.

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:58.270
AND ANGRY OFTEN MENTALLY ILL

02:12:58.337 --> 02:12:59.671
YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:02.240
SHOOTING IN SCHOOLS.

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:05.444
AS THE MOTHER OF AFRICAN

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.479
AMERICAN CHILDREN THE SPOUSE OF

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:10.048
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN AS WELL

02:13:10.115 --> 02:13:11.917
AS A PERSON OF DEEP FAITH.

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:13.685
AND THE DEEPLY CONCERNED CITIZEN

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:15.554
I FEEL THE DESPERATE DESIRE TO

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.823
DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS

02:13:17.889 --> 02:13:19.491
HORRIBLE ATTACKS.

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:20.792
WE ALL WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO

02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:22.494
STOP THIS HORRIBLE ATTACKS

02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:25.397
HOWEVER AB NINE OH SEVEN IS NOT

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:26.932
THE SOLUTION.

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:28.734
AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD EXPAND

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:29.968
THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:31.636
CRIMINAL THREATS AND CREATE A

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:33.438
NEW CRIME OF CRIMINAL THREATS IN

02:13:33.505 --> 02:13:35.574
THE CONTEXT OF A SCHOOL A PLACE

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:37.008
OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:38.443
THE CURRENT STATUTE REGARDING

02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:40.779
CRIMINAL THREATS IS ONE OF GREAT

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.280
CONCERN FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:43.715
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ACROSS THE

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:44.649
STATE.

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:47.152
AS A FELONY IT IS A SERIOUS

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:49.788
FELONY AND IS IS A STRIKE AS IN

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.189
THREE STRIKES.

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:52.858
THE CURRENT STATUTE IS OFTEN

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:54.760
MISUSED TO PENALIZE CONDUCT THAT

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.628
DOES NOT TRULY BELONG IN THE

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:58.430
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:13:58.497 --> 02:14:00.132
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:01.700
OUR CLIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:03.602
CONDITIONS WHO OFTEN SUFFER FROM

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:06.037
CRIPPLING PARANOIA AND DELUSIONS.

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:07.272
THE FEAR THESE CLIENTS

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.608
EXPERIENCE CAN LEAD THEM TO SAY

02:14:09.674 --> 02:14:11.109
THINGS THAT ARE EASILY

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:14.012
MISINTERPRETED OR SIMPLY A

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:15.547
PRODUCT OF THEIR ILLNESS.

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:17.816
WE HAVE A A DEEP THIS

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:19.684

THE AUTHOR SEEKS -- TO DO IS

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:28.527
ALREADY COVERED BY THE CURRENT

OR THE PLACES OF WORSHIP -- IS

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:59.017
VERY MOVING HOWEVER THAT IS

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.952
COVERED IN SUBSECTION EAT AGAIN

02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:03.788
I STATE THAT THE LAW ALREADY

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:07.092
ALLOWS FOR THESE PROSECUTIONS.

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:09.027
FURTHER EXPANDING THIS ALREADY

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:11.162
EXPANSIVE DOVE DEFINITION WILL

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:13.198
WE FAIR ONLY IN SNARE EVEN MORE

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:14.499
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:16.067
CONDITIONS IN THE CRIMINAL

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:17.235
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:19.170
WE ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:20.705
INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL BUT

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:23.608
EXPANSION OF PENAL CODE SECTION

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.377
FOR TWENTY TWO IS NOT THE ANSWER

02:16:25.443 --> 02:16:26.945
AND IT WILL END UP CREATING MORE

02:16:27.012 --> 02:16:27.746
HARM.

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:35.453
THAN IT PROPOSES TO PREVENT.

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.455
WE HAVE A BIRD IN THE OTHER FOR

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:37.923
THERE ARE WITNESSES IN

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:40.058
OPPOSITION.

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:42.027
CNN WILL OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE

02:16:42.093 --> 02:16:44.996
MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. THIRTY

02:16:45.063 --> 02:16:46.531
JACKSON YES A MY UNDERSTANDING

02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:49.734
IS THAT THE BILL'S STILL ALLOWS

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.169
FOR THIS TO BE A WAFFLER.

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.837
SO THAT DEPENDING UPON THE

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:55.407
SEVERITY OF THE BEHAVIOR.

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:57.475
THE COURT WILL HAVE THE RIGHT.

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.477
TO ADJUSTED EITHER IS A FELONY

02:16:59.544 --> 02:17:01.613
OR MISDEMEANOR IS THAT CORRECT

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:06.117
THAT IS -- THAT IS CORRECT AND

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:07.519
BEFORE A CHAIR SKINNER -- LEFT

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:08.653
SHE HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.957
ABOUT -- MISDEMEANOR FOR MINORS

02:17:12.023 --> 02:17:13.692
RIGHT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:17:13.758 --> 02:17:15.427
WE ARE VERY MUCH -- WILLING TO

02:17:15.493 --> 02:17:17.095
ACCOMMODATE [inaudible]

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:18.930
YEAH I'M.

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:23.168
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- YOU KNOW

02:17:23.234 --> 02:17:24.502
THIS BEHAVIORS ARE ALWAYS

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:26.404
LEARNED.

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:27.839
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:28.873
SOME OF THE ACTS THAT ARE

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:31.309
COMMITTED HAVE SUCH SIGNIFICANCE

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:33.211
TO THE VICTIMS WHO ARE THE

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:36.114
RECIPIENTS OF THAT BEHAVIOR.

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:37.349
WHETHER IT'S IN HIGH SCHOOL

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:40.318
THINKING MINORS IN HIGH SCHOOL --

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:42.787
HI I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:45.090
THE THE COURT DISCRETION BUT

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:45.390
CERTAINLY.

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:48.793
I THINK THE BILL IS.

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.362
THE AS CONCEIVED THE ISSUE HERE

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:52.364
IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND SO I

02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:55.667
I'LL MOVE THE BILL -- AND IF YOU

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:59.371
IF YOU CONSIDER -- THE OPTION OF

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.705
REDUCING IT TO A MISDEMEANOR --

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:03.308
CERTAINLY.

02:18:03.375 --> 02:18:05.410
THAT'S THAT SEEMS FINE BUT I

02:18:05.477 --> 02:18:07.379
ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF THIS

02:18:07.445 --> 02:18:10.482
BEHAVIOR JUST REALLY -- KNOCKS

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:12.017
YOUNGSTERS OFF THEIR PENS A FEW

02:18:12.083 --> 02:18:14.486
WILL HAVING BEEN THE RECIPIENT

02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:17.389
OF ACTS OF ANTI SEMITISM AS A

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:21.960
CHILD IN MY OWN SCHOOL AND SOME

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:22.527
OF YOU KNOW.

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:23.762
SCHOOLS AND AND PLAYGROUNDS AND

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:24.162
ALL.

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:24.996
I CAN STILL REMEMBER THOSE

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:27.198
EVENTS AND THEY HAPPENED A LONG

02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:27.666
TIME AGO.

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:30.435
SO I I I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:32.303
TREAT THIS CAVALIERLY -- I DO

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:33.605
THINK SOME OF THIS BEHAVIOR

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:37.909
SADLY IS MALICIOUS MEAN SPIRITED

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:39.377
AND INTENTIONAL.

02:18:39.444 --> 02:18:41.846
SO I THINK -- GIVING GIVEN THE

02:18:41.913 --> 02:18:43.314
COURTS SAID DISCRETION IS IS

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:45.150
STILL A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:46.051
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS

IT FOR MINORS TO MISDEMEANOR

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:00.832

THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION --

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:57.388
AND THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL MEDIA.

02:19:57.455 --> 02:20:01.226
AND OTHER SOURCES THAT CAN

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:06.264
INFLAME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. TO DO

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:07.799

NOT MADE GOOD ON AND YET.

02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:27.485
WHEN IT'S IMMATURE PEOPLE WHO

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:30.021

BY THIS -- BY WHAT'S PRESENT NOW

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:37.162
SO MUCH MORE DOMINANT IN EVEN BY

02:20:37.228 --> 02:20:38.797
LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY.

02:20:46.538 --> 02:20:48.740
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:51.342
IN A SITUATION OF CREATING A

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:53.978
FELONY FOR A MINOR -- CERTAINLY

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:56.681
ANYONE WHO'S AN ADULT WHO.

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.308
THE BASIS FOR THESE THE

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:39.477
ACTIVATIONS OR THE POLICY THAT

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.479
UNDER UNDERLIES THESE ACTIONS.

02:28:41.545 --> 02:28:44.148
I COULD GO ON BUT I WAS TOLD I

02:28:44.215 --> 02:28:45.449
ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES.

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:47.485
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EACH OF

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:49.053
THESE INSTANCES SUBPOENA POWER

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.688
WOULD HAVE HELPED OUR COMMISSION

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:52.256
TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:53.991
ACCOUNTABILITY IN A MORE TIMELY

02:28:54.058 --> 02:28:55.926
MANNER WHICH INCREASES PUBLIC

02:28:55.993 --> 02:28:57.595
TRUST IN PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BE

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:59.363
CLEAR I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.865
SUBPOENA POWER IS A PANACEA I

02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:02.400
BELIEVE THAT MOST COMMISSIONS

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:04.268
WOULD USE IT SPARINGLY AND ONLY

02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:05.269
WHEN NECESSARY.

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:06.871
HOWEVER IT'S AVAILABILITY WILL

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:07.938
ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:09.907
AGENCIES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS

02:29:09.974 --> 02:29:11.342
WITH OVERSIGHT PANEL TO PROVIDE

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:12.610
COMPREHENSIVE AND TIMELY

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:13.978
INFORMATION TOOK CIVILIAN

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:16.480

BEFORE YOU TAKE THE NEXT WITNESS.

02:29:25.056 --> 02:29:26.157
THE COMMITTEE OF COURSE

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:28.693
APPRECIATES BREVITY BUT I DO NOT

02:29:28.759 --> 02:29:31.028
HAVE A TWO MINUTE RULE -- BUT WE

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.930

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:34.532
NEXT WITNESS AND WE HAVE A

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:35.499
MOTION.

ASSOCIATION TO SUPPORT READ THIS

02:29:42.673 --> 02:29:45.076
BILL -- HI.

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:45.976
I AM GOING TO SPEAK A LITTLE

02:29:46.043 --> 02:29:48.612
MORE BROAD STROKES THAN MY

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:51.682
COLLEAGUE -- BUT I HAVE SIMILAR

02:29:51.749 --> 02:29:53.184
COMMENTS TO MAKE.

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.019
IF THE ARGUMENT FROM THE

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:56.354
OPPOSITION.

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:57.988
AND I WILL START WITH THIS IS

02:29:58.055 --> 02:29:59.190
THAT THE COUNTY BOARDS OF

02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:01.292
SUPERVISORS ALREADY HAVE THE

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:02.526
POWER TO CREATE THESE.

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:05.129
I'M SORRY.

02:30:05.196 --> 02:30:06.564
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.466
THEN THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.967
TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION.

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:12.703
AS WE KNOW REGARDING -- THE

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.372
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES THAT

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:16.974
CURRENTLY EXIST SOME ARE GOOD

02:30:17.041 --> 02:30:18.509
AND SOME ARE NOT.

02:30:18.576 --> 02:30:19.777
HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:22.947
COMMUNITY MUST BE ALLOWED TO

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:24.882
POLICE THE POLICE.

02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:26.650
THE ONLY WAY A DEPUTY OR POLICE

02:30:26.717 --> 02:30:28.719
OFFICER COMPLACENT AREA AND KEEP

02:30:28.786 --> 02:30:31.555
THE CITIZENS SAFE IS IF THE

02:30:31.622 --> 02:30:33.391
COMMUNITY LETS THEM [inaudible]

02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:35.226
TRUSTS THEM.

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:37.495
AND PERHAPS EVEN WORKS WITH THEM.

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:39.163
WE'RE IN A NEW TIME WHERE THE

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.898
WORD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NO

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.666
LONGER TAKEN AS GOSPEL BY THE

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:43.801
PUBLIC.

02:30:43.868 --> 02:30:46.370
NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACCESS

02:30:46.437 --> 02:30:49.240
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:51.142
THIS BILL JUST IT JUST GIVES THE

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.943
POWER TO CREATE CIVILIAN

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:54.578
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES NOT A

02:30:54.645 --> 02:30:55.880
DIRECTIVE.

02:30:55.946 --> 02:30:57.848
AND AS WE KNOW FROM OTHER ISSUES

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:58.949
EVERY COUNTY WILL SET UP

02:30:59.016 --> 02:31:00.251
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:31:00.317 --> 02:31:01.786
FROM OTHER COUNTIES THERE'S NO

02:31:01.852 --> 02:31:03.721
REQUIREMENT AS TO HOW THE

02:31:03.788 --> 02:31:05.122
COMMITTEE IS TO WORK.

02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:06.624
I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE AREAS

02:31:06.690 --> 02:31:07.992
WHERE THERE IS CIVILIAN

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:11.729
OVERSIGHT THE SKY HAS NOT FALLEN.

02:31:11.796 --> 02:31:13.831
IN FACT IN SAN FRANCISCO THE

02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:15.566
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THE

02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:16.867
SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.569
POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY HAS

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:20.271
ACTUALLY BEEN ASKED BY THE

02:31:20.337 --> 02:31:21.605
SHERIFF TO TAKE OVER CERTAIN

02:31:21.672 --> 02:31:23.607
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC.

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:26.477
INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS.

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:27.678
IF A COMMITTEE CAN LOOK AT THE

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:29.547
DIFFERENT PLACES THAT THINGS CAN

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:31.549
GO WRONG IN THE FIELD IN THE

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:32.283
JAIL.

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:34.618
IN TRANSPORT.

02:31:34.685 --> 02:31:36.821
THEN THIS COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE

02:31:36.887 --> 02:31:39.924
LIABILITY FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENTS.

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:41.425
THERE ARE JAILS IN THE STATE

02:31:41.492 --> 02:31:43.027
THAT HAVE DEPLORABLE MENTAL AND

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:44.929
PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SOME

02:31:44.995 --> 02:31:47.164
OF HAD TO BE SUED AND EVEN THEN

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:48.632
A THIRTIES DRAG THEIR FEET IN

02:31:48.699 --> 02:31:50.234
ADDRESSING THE ISSUES.

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.436
A COMMITTEE COULD PERHAPS LOOK

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.938
INTO THESE PROBLEMS AND SUGGEST

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:55.673
CORRECTIONS WHICH WOULD THEN

02:31:55.739 --> 02:31:58.409
AVOID EXTREMELY COSTLY

02:31:58.476 --> 02:31:59.243
LITIGATION.

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:00.678
WE BELIEVE THE KEY TO THE

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:03.380
OBJECTIONS BY THE OPPOSITION IS

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:04.915
ACTUALLY THE POWER OF SUBPOENA.

02:32:04.982 --> 02:32:07.184
I UST NOTE THAT STILL MOST

02:32:07.251 --> 02:32:09.787
PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED OF TESTING

02:32:09.854 --> 02:32:11.388
FOR TESTIFYING AGAINST THE

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:13.757
POLICE OR DEPUTY SHERIFF'S.

02:32:13.824 --> 02:32:14.992
I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:16.827
AN EXAMPLE OF WHY IT IS CRITICAL

02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:17.995
THAT THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:19.563
COMMITTEES ALSO HAVE SUBPOENA

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:21.599
POWER.

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:23.934
A YOUNG MAN WAS STOPPED BY AN

02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:27.338
OFFICER AND SEARCHED ON HIM WAS

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:29.974
FOUND A GLASS PIPE.

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:33.010
MATH PIPE CRACK PIPE SORT OF

02:32:33.077 --> 02:32:35.045
GLASS PIPE THE OFFICER TOOK THE

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:37.348
PIPE SMASHED IT ON THE GROUND

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:39.316
PICKED UP THE GLASS AND GROUND

02:32:39.383 --> 02:32:42.520
IT INTO THIS YOUNG MAN'S FACE.

02:32:42.586 --> 02:32:45.456
SOME HOW THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

02:32:45.523 --> 02:32:48.325
GOT WORD OF THE COMPLAINT BUT

02:32:48.392 --> 02:32:51.228
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS TERRIFIED TO

02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:52.897
COME IN HE WAS NOT GOING TO

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:55.032
TESTIFY AGAINST THIS PERSON WHO

02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:56.300

02:32:56.367 --> 02:32:57.768
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:59.770
HOWEVER ALONG WITH THE POWER OF

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:01.672

SOME JOURNAL PROMISES A

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:07.311
PROTECTION AS THE YOUNG MAN CAME

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:08.646
AND WENT FROM THE HEARING.

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:10.114
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WAS

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:12.149
IN FACT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.183
THIS ACTION.

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:13.984
I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE

02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:15.279
IN THAT REGARD WE BELIEVE THE

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:16.280

IT HAS TO EXIST -- YOU YOU'RE

02:43:51.922 --> 02:43:53.590
NOT TAKING AWAY THE FLEXIBILITY

02:43:53.657 --> 02:43:55.192
BUT YOU'RE CREATING THIS

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:56.927
PRESSURE ON A BOARD BECAUSE AND

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:58.295

DEPARTMENT TO PUT FORTH A SERIES

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:37.787
OF RECOMMENDATIONS FAMILIES WHO

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:43.760
I CAN OF THE WITH OUR

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:44.894
IMMIGRATION WHEN WE WERE

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:45.762
INITIALLY FORMING OUR

02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:47.163

OF LUMINOUS INFORMATION ABOUT --

02:46:51.968 --> 02:46:53.470
THEIR PRACTICES INITIALLY AND

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:54.804
THEN ONCE WE STARTED TO SEE THAT

02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:56.673
WE WEREN'T GETTING THE FULL

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:58.108

WAR WAR AT A QUESTIONS THAT WERE

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:04.314
A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVERSARIAL

02:47:04.381 --> 02:47:05.849
BUT THAT'S ONLY WHEN THE

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:07.117
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS IN.

02:47:07.183 --> 02:47:08.885
PROVIDING COMPLETE TRANSPARENT

TIMELY INFORMATION SO WE HAD TO

02:47:17.694 --> 02:47:19.129
PRESS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT --

02:47:19.195 --> 02:47:21.030

GIVE US MORE INFORMATION -- WITH

02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:26.102
THIS NEW SHERIFF WERE

02:47:26.169 --> 02:47:28.371
EXPERIENCING -- I'M GONNA TRY TO

02:47:28.438 --> 02:47:29.839
PUT THIS -- GENTLY WE WE ARE

02:47:29.906 --> 02:47:32.075
EXPERIENCING A LEVEL OF NON

02:47:32.142 --> 02:47:34.177
COOPERATION THAT WE DID NOT

02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:34.711
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRIOR

02:47:34.778 --> 02:47:37.213
SHERIFF -- IN SO WE ARE GETTING

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:38.248
STONE WALLED IN A LOT OF

02:47:38.314 --> 02:47:39.549
DIFFERENT ARENAS THAT ARE VERY

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:43.653
CRITICAL -- RELATED -- TO

OF DIFFERENT CRITICAL AREAS --

02:47:49.359 --> 02:47:52.829
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S OF ANY ONE

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:54.831
SIZE FITS ALL IN TERMS OF THIS

02:47:54.898 --> 02:47:56.232
IS EVER SERIAL OR IT ISN'T I

02:47:56.299 --> 02:47:57.567
THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

02:47:57.634 --> 02:48:01.838
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- AND AS I

02:48:01.905 --> 02:48:03.773
SAID I THINK -- THE EXPERIENCE

OF SAYS CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:04.974
COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE SUBPOENA

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.342
POWERS IS AT THE USER'S VERY

02:48:06.409 --> 02:48:07.710
JUDICIOUSLY THEY USE IT AS A

02:48:07.777 --> 02:48:09.145
LAST RESORT THEY WOULD RATHER

INFORMATION THEY'RE ASKING FOR I

02:48:14.017 --> 02:48:14.784
THINK THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:16.753
PREFER THAT AND SO I DON'T THINK

02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:19.422

VERY INVOLVED PROCESS AND IT'S A

02:58:55.391 --> 02:58:56.826
VERY EXPENSIVE.

02:58:56.892 --> 02:58:58.994
ONE JUST BETWEEN -- THE

02:58:59.061 --> 02:59:00.296

FEES AND THE FINGERPRINTS YOU'RE

02:59:02.364 --> 02:59:03.899
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER TWO

02:59:03.966 --> 02:59:04.533
HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT DOESN'T

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.135
EVEN INCLUDE -- THE TRAINING

02:59:06.202 --> 02:59:07.903
WHICH IS IN THE TWO HUNDRED

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:09.705
DOLLAR RANGE -- ADDITIONALLY ARE

02:59:09.772 --> 02:59:11.040
PERMITS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR TWO

02:59:11.107 --> 02:59:12.775
YEARS AND THEY HAVE TO BE

02:59:12.842 --> 02:59:15.211
RENEWED WHICH ALSO COMES AROUND --

02:59:15.277 --> 02:59:16.178
YOU KNOW DID THAT'S ANOTHER

02:59:16.245 --> 02:59:18.314
EXPENDITURE BY BY CITIZENS HERE

02:59:18.380 --> 02:59:20.282
IN CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU LOOK AT

02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:22.284
SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING STATES --

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:23.419
THAT ISSUE PERMITS THEIR THEIR

02:59:23.486 --> 02:59:25.421
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT AND

02:59:25.488 --> 02:59:28.324
THE PERMITS OR FOR SIGNIFICANTLY

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:29.959
LONGER DURATIONS.

02:59:30.025 --> 02:59:31.527
AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE REALLY

02:59:31.594 --> 02:59:33.229
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BUDGET HERE

02:59:33.295 --> 02:59:34.563
IN THE MONETARY COSTS WILL WE

02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:36.065
SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT IS

02:59:36.132 --> 02:59:37.466
EXTENDING THE DURATION.

02:59:37.533 --> 02:59:40.102
OF CCW PERMITS TO FOR FIVE YEARS

02:59:40.169 --> 02:59:40.970
LIKE MOST STATES AROUND THE%

02:59:41.036 --> 02:59:41.871
COUNTRY.

02:59:41.937 --> 02:59:43.806
CCW PERMITS IT'S NOT THAT YOU

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:45.674
GET ISSUE DEPARTMENT AND YOU

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:46.509
HAVE A GOOD DAY THESE.

02:59:46.575 --> 02:59:48.144
A PERMIT HOLDERS ARE MONITORED

02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:49.778
IN IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS

02:59:49.845 --> 02:59:50.646
ANY SORT OF VIOLATION.

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:52.381
THAT WOULD MAKE THEM INELIGIBLE

02:59:52.448 --> 02:59:53.849
TO HOLD THAT PERMIT THE PERMIT

02:59:53.916 --> 02:59:55.151
IS REVOKED.

02:59:55.217 --> 02:59:55.885
SO WE COULD CUT OUR

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:57.153
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN HALF

02:59:57.219 --> 02:59:59.688
SIMPLY BY DOUBLING THE DURATION

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:00.823
OF THE PERMIT.

03:00:00.890 --> 03:00:03.993
KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS

03:00:04.059 --> 03:00:06.195
BY REMOVING THE CAP -- WE COULD

03:00:06.262 --> 03:00:08.097
HAVE A AN INEQUITABLE SYSTEM

03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:08.531
BEYOND.

03:00:08.597 --> 03:00:09.565
THE THE FALL TO THE HOUSE RIGHT

03:00:09.632 --> 03:00:11.333
NOW WITH THE WAY THESE PERMITS

03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:13.469
CAN BE ISSUE BUT YOU COULD HAVE

03:00:13.536 --> 03:00:15.871
CERTAIN CHAIRS THAT ARE CHARGING.

03:00:15.938 --> 03:00:17.072
OR ISSUING AUTHORITIES CHARGING

03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:19.275
EXORBITANT COSTS FOR THIS AND IT

03:00:19.341 --> 03:00:21.644
WOULD -- PRICE PEOPLE OUT SO

03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:23.812
TRULY THESE WOULD BE RESERVE FOR

03:00:23.879 --> 03:00:25.214
THE ELITE OR THE FAVORED.

03:00:25.281 --> 03:00:26.849
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT

03:00:26.916 --> 03:00:28.484
THAT THIS IS THIS IS.

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:29.818
SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:31.086
THERE'S A DEMAND FOR IT A DEMAND

03:00:31.153 --> 03:00:34.089
TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS AND

03:00:34.156 --> 03:00:35.824
DEFEND YOURSELF IN YOUR FAMILY --

03:00:35.891 --> 03:00:37.293
AND SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE

03:00:37.359 --> 03:00:38.394
RIGHT WAY ABOUT GOING AND I

03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:39.495
ABOUT CUTTING OUR COSTS I THINK

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:41.530
THAT THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE IN AS

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:42.698
YOU NOTICE THERE'S NO LAW

03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:43.799
ENFORCEMENT OR ISSUING AUTHORITY

03:00:43.866 --> 03:00:44.500
HERE.

03:00:44.567 --> 03:00:45.935
SAYING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

03:00:46.001 --> 03:00:47.469
RECOVERING ENOUGH MONEY IN

03:00:47.536 --> 03:00:49.572
ISSUING THESE PERMITS -- TODAY

03:00:49.638 --> 03:00:51.440
SO I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO

03:00:51.507 --> 03:00:53.409
LOOK AT THOSE COSTS WOULD LOOK

03:00:53.475 --> 03:00:54.944
AT EXTENDING THE DURATION RATHER

03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:56.979
THAN PLACING MORE COSTS ON ON

03:00:57.046 --> 03:00:59.048
THE PEOPLE THANK YOU.

03:00:59.114 --> 03:01:00.516
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SEPARATIST

REPRESENTING ON WAS CALIFORNIA.

03:01:02.384 --> 03:01:04.787

03:01:04.853 --> 03:01:06.088
SPEAK TO TERRIBLE.

03:01:06.155 --> 03:01:07.856
THE SHERIFF'S OF VERY RECENTLY

03:01:12.361 --> 03:01:13.495
ME THAT FIRST THERE ARE.

03:01:13.562 --> 03:01:14.263
THE RUN THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:15.831
A PROFITABLE GOVERNMENT SERVICE

03:01:15.898 --> 03:01:18.567
PROGRAM ALL SERVICES COST MONEY

03:01:18.634 --> 03:01:20.603
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

03:01:20.669 --> 03:01:22.104
THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE

03:01:22.171 --> 03:01:23.472
SPENDING THE MONEY.

03:01:23.539 --> 03:01:25.708
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:28.010
MAXIMIZE THE USE IN ORDER TO

03:01:28.077 --> 03:01:28.877
ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE GOALS THAT

03:01:28.944 --> 03:01:31.714
THEIR ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH

03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:36.218
STATUTORILY -- AND SOMETIMES

03:01:36.285 --> 03:01:37.786
THAT MEANS AS AS WE KNOWING AND

03:01:37.853 --> 03:01:39.355
GOVERNMENT I SERVED UNDER TWO

03:01:39.421 --> 03:01:41.523

03:01:41.590 --> 03:01:42.625
OF COMMERCE IN THE TRADE AND

03:01:42.691 --> 03:01:44.493
COMMERCE AGENCY AND I SAW HOW IT

03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:46.562
WAS -- IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:46.629 --> 03:01:47.896
BE.

03:01:47.963 --> 03:01:49.632
FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO COVER.

03:01:49.698 --> 03:01:50.799

03:01:59.875 --> 03:02:01.577
IT AND AND I THINK THE CHEFS ARE

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:02.878
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THAT.

03:02:02.945 --> 03:02:04.146
NOW THERE'S A MATTER OF SCALE

03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:30.913
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE COST

03:06:30.979 --> 03:06:32.981
REALLY WOULD VARY BY COUNTY I

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:35.050
MEAN THERE'S A STATE STANDARD IN

03:06:35.117 --> 03:06:36.718
TERMS OF THE THE TRAINING THAT'S

03:06:36.785 --> 03:06:38.687

WHICH YOU'RE APPLYING FOR THE

03:06:41.557 --> 03:06:43.725

03:06:43.792 --> 03:06:45.460
TO THE LOCAL LAW FOR CERTAIN THE

03:06:45.527 --> 03:06:46.194
SHERIFF.

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:48.230
TERMLY -- TO DETERMINE THAT

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:50.032
THERE IS GOOD CAUSE AND THAT THE

03:07:02.844 --> 03:07:04.446
ACCOUNTABLE BY THE VOTERS --

03:07:04.513 --> 03:07:06.315
BASED ON THAT POLICY WHAT I FIND

03:07:06.381 --> 03:07:07.916
ALARMING IN SACRAMENTO IS THE

03:07:07.983 --> 03:07:10.185
COUNTY SHERIFF SAID HE ISSUES

03:07:10.252 --> 03:07:11.853
AND QUICKLY AND THEN HE TAKES

03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:16.224
HIM BACK IT DOESN'T HEAT

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:18.026
HESITATE TO REVOKE ON THE REVOKE

03:07:18.093 --> 03:07:18.560
SOME BECAUSE THE PERSON'S

03:07:18.627 --> 03:07:19.328
COMMITTED A CRIME.

03:07:19.394 --> 03:07:20.162
AFTER SOMETHING IS HAPPENING

03:07:20.228 --> 03:07:21.530
AFTER PERHAPS SOMEONE HAS BEEN

03:07:21.597 --> 03:07:23.632
HARMED THAT'S THAT'S VERY

03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:25.601
ALARMING -- AGAIN THAT'S A

03:07:25.667 --> 03:07:27.235
SEPARATE POLICY ABOUT THE

03:07:27.302 --> 03:07:29.805

03:07:32.908 --> 03:07:34.810
ACCOUNT THAT A SHERIFF CHOOSES

03:07:34.876 --> 03:07:36.979
TO FOLLOW BUT THE VERY LEAST

03:07:37.045 --> 03:07:39.014
THERE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE FUNDING

03:07:39.081 --> 03:07:43.352

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:24.412
I GUESS IT BOILS DOWN TO THE

03:15:24.479 --> 03:15:26.247
FACT THAT SOME COUNTIES LIKE

03:15:26.314 --> 03:15:27.449
SACRAMENTO WHERE THERE'S OVER A

03:15:27.515 --> 03:15:28.483
MILLION PEOPLE.

03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:30.118
THE ISSUE THEY HAVE TEN THOUSAND

03:15:30.185 --> 03:15:32.220
PERMITS SOME COUNTY LIKE LA

03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:33.955
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THEY ISSUE

03:15:34.022 --> 03:15:36.424
A COUPLE HUNDRED SO IT ADDED

03:15:36.491 --> 03:15:37.525
IT'S IT'S BASED UPON.

03:15:37.592 --> 03:15:38.493
YOU KNOW THEIR WORKLOAD AND

03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:39.961
ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

03:15:40.028 --> 03:15:41.896
AND I GUESS WE COULD PUT A CALL

03:15:41.963 --> 03:15:43.431
IN THERE PUT INDEX TO IT BUT I

03:15:43.498 --> 03:15:45.200
THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION IS

03:15:45.266 --> 03:15:47.735
THAT -- SHOULD BE BASED UPON

03:15:47.802 --> 03:15:49.671
YOUR YOUR COUNTY AND HAVE A TRUE

03:15:49.737 --> 03:15:51.306
RECOVERY MODEL.

03:15:51.372 --> 03:15:52.407
AS IS THE EARLIER BY WITNESS

03:15:52.474 --> 03:15:54.809
AFTER PROP THIRTEEN THAT BECAME

03:15:54.876 --> 03:15:56.144
THE BASIS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:15:56.211 --> 03:15:57.412
FOR WRONG OR RIGHT.

03:15:57.479 --> 03:15:59.180
THAT IT'S IT'S A COST RECOVERY

03:15:59.247 --> 03:16:01.282
FOR THE SERVICES AND AS THE AND

03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:03.451
ARE A WITNESS TESTIFIED -- THESE

03:16:03.518 --> 03:16:05.153
THINGS DO COST MONEY AND IT'S

03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:07.188
NOT DIRT THERE IT'S A COUPLE

03:16:07.255 --> 03:16:08.823
HUNDRED DOLLARS LITERALLY AND IF

03:16:08.890 --> 03:16:10.291
THEY CAN IF IN IT IF INCREASE

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:11.426
FOR TRUE COST BASED UPON THE

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:12.894
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE.

03:16:12.961 --> 03:16:14.195
IT WOULDN'T QUITE DOUBLES SO

03:16:14.262 --> 03:16:15.363
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THOUSANDS OF

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:16.264
DOLLARS FOR SOMEONE TO GET A CCW

03:16:16.331 --> 03:16:17.599
PERMIT WOULD BE.

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:19.667
INCREMENTALLY MORE BUT IF IT

03:16:19.734 --> 03:16:21.169
TAKES THAT THE BIGGER QUESTIONS

03:16:21.236 --> 03:16:22.370
WHO SHOULD PAY THE DIFFERENCE

03:16:22.437 --> 03:16:24.272
SHOULD BE THE PERSON GETTING THE

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:26.074
PRIVILEGE OF THAT PERMIT. FOR

03:16:26.141 --> 03:16:28.276
THE GENERAL TAXPAYER AND SO I

03:16:28.343 --> 03:16:31.012
THINK THAT'S THE WITH THE BATES

03:16:31.079 --> 03:16:31.980
ALL ABOUT HERE TODAY

03:16:32.046 --> 03:16:32.280
[inaudible]

03:16:32.347 --> 03:16:34.682
PERHAPS I'M.

03:16:34.749 --> 03:16:36.885
WHY NOT HAVE AN INITIAL FEE?

03:16:36.951 --> 03:16:39.053
AND THEN A VERY LOW RENEWAL FEE

03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:40.255
WHERE NO WORK IS DONE OTHER THAN

03:16:40.321 --> 03:16:41.055
YOU'RE JUST [inaudible]

03:16:41.122 --> 03:16:44.859
RE UPPING.

03:16:44.926 --> 03:16:46.961
LIKE A TWO TWO TWO STAGE PROGRAM

03:16:47.028 --> 03:16:48.730
WHICH WAS ONE I DISAGREE WHEN I

03:16:48.796 --> 03:16:50.131
DID WAS JUST TAKE MAKE THE

03:16:50.198 --> 03:16:52.333
PERMIT NOT ONE YEAR BUT MAKE IT

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.768
FOR YOU KNOW MAKE IT FOR YEARS.

03:16:53.835 --> 03:16:55.103
AND THEN YOU'D YOU'D HAVE ONE

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:56.704
SHOT EVERY FOUR YEARS.

03:16:56.771 --> 03:16:59.207
BUT HOW ABOUT THE FIRST INITIAL

03:16:59.274 --> 03:17:00.708
APPROVAL IS ONE FEE AND THEN.

03:17:00.775 --> 03:17:02.410
JUST SITTING IN A RENEWAL

03:17:02.477 --> 03:17:03.578
ANNUALLY THAT SHOULD BE A LOT

03:17:03.645 --> 03:17:05.413
LESS CORRECT YOU CAN RESPOND

03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:07.048
SURE THAT THE THE RENEWAL THING

03:17:07.115 --> 03:17:08.583
EVERY FOUR YEARS I THINK IT'S A

03:17:08.650 --> 03:17:09.918
TERRIBLE IDEA LET ME TELL YOU

03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:12.020
WHY THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL.

03:17:12.086 --> 03:17:13.354

03:17:18.993 --> 03:17:19.494
AMMUNITION.

03:17:19.561 --> 03:17:22.463
AND SOMEHOW THE HOUSEKEEPING AND

03:17:22.530 --> 03:17:24.432
SERVANT AT SERVICE INDIVIDUAL

03:17:24.499 --> 03:17:25.934
WALKED IN AND DISCOVERED ALL

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.903
THIS AND CALLED HER MANAGER.

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:29.837
AND THEY CALL THE SACK WHEN THE

03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:31.940
POLICE DEPARTMENT IT COULDN'T

03:17:32.006 --> 03:17:32.974
FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

03:17:33.041 --> 03:17:34.576
THEY THEY FOUND THE GUY WHO IS

03:17:34.642 --> 03:17:36.511

03:17:52.660 --> 03:17:53.561
AND SO.

03:17:53.628 --> 03:17:55.563
THESE THINGS OUGHT TO BE RENEWED

03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:57.365

03:30:57.378 --> 03:30:58.846
SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME.

03:30:58.912 --> 03:31:00.514
RATHER THEY ONLY SERVE TO LIMIT

03:31:00.581 --> 03:31:01.949
THE DISCRETION AND TIE THE HANDS

03:31:02.016 --> 03:31:03.250

03:31:08.355 --> 03:31:10.491

ON A RED TO QUICKLY RECKLESS

03:42:11.117 --> 03:42:12.986
DRIVING IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO

03:42:13.053 --> 03:42:14.621
MISDEMEANOR.

03:42:14.688 --> 03:42:15.955
AND IT IS DRIVING WITH SUCH AN

03:42:16.022 --> 03:42:17.757
EGREGIOUS LACK OF RESPECT FOR

03:42:17.824 --> 03:42:18.992
OTHER PEOPLE ON THE ROAD THAT

03:42:19.059 --> 03:42:20.393
YOU WERE CREATING.

03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:21.428
THE HAZARD.

03:42:21.494 --> 03:42:23.096
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT WAS

03:42:23.163 --> 03:42:24.764
DEVELOPED WITH THE CONSULTATION

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:26.199
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SAYS

03:42:26.266 --> 03:42:27.267
THAT THE FINES THAT ARE ON THE

03:42:27.333 --> 03:42:29.202
BOOKS AND THE PENALTIES ARE NOT

03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:30.670
TO TURN PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING

03:42:30.737 --> 03:42:30.870
MONEY?

03:42:30.937 --> 03:42:32.338
STREET RACING.

03:42:32.405 --> 03:42:33.973
WHAT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO

03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:35.041
FOLKS IS HAVING THEIR CAR TAKEN

03:42:35.108 --> 03:42:36.643
AWAY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF

03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:37.610
TIME?

03:42:37.677 --> 03:42:38.978
AND ALSO RIGHT NOW IN THE LAW

03:42:39.045 --> 03:42:40.146
THERE'S NOTHING THAT REQUIRES

03:42:40.213 --> 03:42:41.681
LEGAL MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE

03:42:41.748 --> 03:42:42.982
MADE TO SEE STREET RACING

03:42:43.049 --> 03:42:45.819
VEHICLES TO BE REMOVED PRIOR TO

03:42:45.885 --> 03:42:46.419
THAT CAR BEING RELEASED FROM

03:42:46.486 --> 03:42:47.120
IMPOUND.

03:42:47.187 --> 03:42:48.521
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS

03:42:48.588 --> 03:42:50.690
THAT ON YOUR SECOND CONVICTION

03:42:50.757 --> 03:42:51.324
FOR STREET RACING OR RECKLESS

03:42:51.391 --> 03:42:53.393
DRIVING YOUR CAR WILL BE

03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:54.761
IMPOUNDED FOR THIRTY DAYS NOW

03:42:54.828 --> 03:42:57.430
THERE ARE A LOT OF OFF RAMPS?

03:42:57.497 --> 03:42:59.432
IN THE CASE OF HARDSHIP IF THE

03:42:59.499 --> 03:43:00.400
CASE THAT IT'S A A CHILD WHO

03:43:00.467 --> 03:43:01.634
BORROWED THE CAR BUT THEY'RE NOT

03:43:01.701 --> 03:43:03.770
THE PRIMARY USER IF YOU NEED THE

03:43:03.837 --> 03:43:05.572
VEHICLE TO GET TO A JOB THERE'S

03:43:05.638 --> 03:43:07.907
A LOT OF OFF RAMPS TO MAKE THIS

03:43:07.974 --> 03:43:10.343
DURABLE AND NOT OVERLY.

03:43:10.410 --> 03:43:10.910
PUNITIVE.

03:43:10.977 --> 03:43:11.978
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT FOR THOSE

03:43:12.045 --> 03:43:13.113
WHO ARE WHOSE LIVES ARE PUT AT

03:43:13.179 --> 03:43:15.181
RISK AND SOMETIMES TAKEN BECAUSE

03:43:15.248 --> 03:43:16.816
OF RECKLESS DRIVERS AND SERIAL

03:43:16.883 --> 03:43:18.017
RECKLESS DRIVERS.

03:43:18.084 --> 03:43:19.953
THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO SAFE

03:43:20.019 --> 03:43:22.155
STREETS THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT

03:43:22.222 --> 03:43:24.057
TO NOT BE MOWED DOWN IN A

03:43:24.124 --> 03:43:25.959
CROSSWALK OR IN A SIDE IN THE

03:43:26.025 --> 03:43:26.226
SIDEWALK.

03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:27.193
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN LOS

03:43:27.260 --> 03:43:28.361

03:43:28.428 --> 03:43:30.230
WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE

03:43:30.296 --> 03:43:31.698
TYPE OF EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY?

03:43:31.765 --> 03:43:33.633
WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A

03:43:33.700 --> 03:43:36.669
SENSIBLE AND BALANCED A SOLUTION.

03:43:36.736 --> 03:43:37.871
I'M I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE

03:43:37.937 --> 03:43:40.273

WITH REGARD TO IMPOUNDMENT THIS

03:44:40.767 --> 03:44:42.402
IT DENIES JUDGES THE OPPORTUNITY

03:44:42.468 --> 03:44:44.103

SOMEONE.

03:47:05.645 --> 03:47:07.847
THAT WAS STRUCK BY A CAR I THINK

03:47:07.914 --> 03:47:10.450
JUST LAST WEEK IN LOS ANGELES A

03:47:10.516 --> 03:47:11.718
NINETY TWO YEAR OLD INDIVIDUAL.

WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BUT I

03:47:13.586 --> 03:47:14.921
GUESS MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT

03:47:14.988 --> 03:47:17.423
THE THE THE LAW ALREADY PERMITS

03:47:17.490 --> 03:47:19.392
FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE BILL

03:47:19.459 --> 03:47:20.860

03:47:27.333 --> 03:47:28.701
NEVER GIVEN.

03:47:28.768 --> 03:47:29.936
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND SAID AS

03:47:30.003 --> 03:47:31.104
WERE CUT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE

03:47:31.170 --> 03:47:32.038
GUIDANCE THE JUDGES SAYING THAT

03:47:32.105 --> 03:47:33.973
THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE

03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:35.008
AND IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC

03:47:35.074 --> 03:47:35.675
HARDSHIP.

03:47:35.742 --> 03:47:37.677
IF THERE ARE HARD HARDSHIPS THEY

03:47:37.744 --> 03:47:39.846
HAVE THE DISCRETION TO REDUCE

03:47:39.912 --> 03:47:41.014
THE IN HOME IN ORDER TO WEIGH

03:47:41.080 --> 03:47:42.448
THE COMPLETELY SO WE'RE STILL

03:47:42.515 --> 03:47:43.616
GIVING THEM QUITE A LOT OF

03:47:43.683 --> 03:47:44.684
DISCRETION.

03:47:44.751 --> 03:47:45.952

THEIR SIDE ALMOST ALL THE TIME.

03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:51.090
I ALSO.

03:47:51.157 --> 03:47:52.692
THINK THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S

03:47:52.759 --> 03:47:54.894
COMMITTED THIS OF TWICE.

03:47:54.961 --> 03:47:57.430

03:47:57.497 --> 03:47:58.798
THAT'S NOT BEING DONE NOW UNDER

03:47:58.865 --> 03:47:59.732
THE LAW.

03:47:59.799 --> 03:48:01.434
AND I BELIEVE ALSO THAT

03:48:01.501 --> 03:48:08.775
PEDESTRIANS IN LOS ANGELES AND

03:48:08.841 --> 03:48:09.809
CYCLISTS HAVE RIGHTS.

03:48:09.876 --> 03:48:10.643
TO AND WE ARE AND DRIVING IS A

03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:11.644
PRIVILEGE IT'S NOT A RIGHT.

03:48:11.711 --> 03:48:12.578
AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING A CAR

03:48:12.645 --> 03:48:13.646
RECKLESSLY TO THE EXTENT TO

03:48:13.713 --> 03:48:14.347
WHERE IT'S A CRIMINAL.

03:48:14.414 --> 03:48:15.915
CONVICTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:48:15.982 --> 03:48:17.550
NOT JUST YOUR A SLOPPY DRIVER

03:48:17.617 --> 03:48:18.818
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACTING IN A

03:48:18.885 --> 03:48:20.119
CRIMINAL NATURE AND YOU DO IT

03:48:20.186 --> 03:48:21.687
TWICE.

03:48:21.754 --> 03:48:22.355
THE NOT PRIVILEGE SHOULD BE

03:48:22.422 --> 03:48:23.589
REVOED FOR PURITY OF TIME I

03:48:23.656 --> 03:48:27.226
THINK THAT THAT IS IS REASONABLE.

03:48:27.293 --> 03:48:29.762
AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU HAVE

03:48:29.829 --> 03:48:30.463
TURNED.

03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:32.832
THE VEHICLE INTO A WEAPON AT

03:48:32.899 --> 03:48:33.733
THAT POINT.

03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:35.268
SO I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN

03:48:35.334 --> 03:48:36.369
THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

03:48:36.436 --> 03:48:37.770
HASN'T BEEN WORKING AND IF YOU

03:48:37.837 --> 03:48:39.505
DO KNOW THAT AS YOU JUST POINTED

03:48:39.572 --> 03:48:40.139
OUT.

03:48:40.206 --> 03:48:41.374
A SO IT'S STILL EARLY WE ARE

03:48:41.441 --> 03:48:43.443
SEEING THESE TYPES OF DEATHS

03:48:43.509 --> 03:48:44.544
INCREASE.

03:48:44.610 --> 03:48:45.678
SO WE DIDN'T WE NEED TO DO

03:48:45.745 --> 03:48:46.913
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE I'VE

03:48:46.979 --> 03:48:48.181
WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

03:48:48.247 --> 03:48:49.282
THEY SAY LISTEN THIS WHEN

03:48:49.348 --> 03:48:50.783
SOMEONE'S MAKING MONEY.

03:48:50.850 --> 03:48:52.585
ST EXHIBITIONS WHAT BAKER ABOUT

03:48:52.652 --> 03:48:53.920
IS LOSING THAT THAT SOURCE OF

03:48:53.986 --> 03:48:55.254
EXTRA INCOME.

03:48:55.321 --> 03:48:56.355
AND ALSO HAVING TO REMOVE THOSE

03:48:56.422 --> 03:48:57.890
MODIFICATIONS SO I THINK THAT WE

03:48:57.957 --> 03:48:59.692
SHOULD GIVE THIS A TRY BECAUSE

03:48:59.759 --> 03:49:01.661
I'M AFRAID TO LET MY DAUGHTER

03:49:01.727 --> 03:49:02.562
WALKED ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW

03:49:02.628 --> 03:49:03.162
IN LOS ANGELES.

03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:06.766
AND I GET THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE

03:49:06.833 --> 03:49:08.468
I TO SEE A I SEE.

03:49:08.534 --> 03:49:09.335
LEAVING THE HOUSE IN THE MORNING

03:49:09.402 --> 03:49:10.603
WERE FOLKS HAVE DONE DONUTS IN

03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:11.437
THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION

03:49:11.504 --> 03:49:13.106
AT TWO AM IN THE MORNING AND ALL

03:49:13.172 --> 03:49:18.744
THOSE THINGS THAT ARE -- A REAL

03:49:18.811 --> 03:49:20.246
HAZARD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

03:49:20.313 --> 03:49:21.614
WHY NOT HAVE SOMEONE?

03:49:21.681 --> 03:49:23.116
ARRESTED FOR THIRTY I RATHER SEE

03:49:23.182 --> 03:49:24.050
HIM ARRESTED I THINK THAT'S MORE

03:49:24.117 --> 03:49:25.184
OF A DETERRENT BECAUSE JUST

03:49:25.251 --> 03:49:26.018
BECAUSE YOU AND POUND THE CAR

03:49:26.085 --> 03:49:27.086
DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T GET

03:49:27.153 --> 03:49:28.955
SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR AND AND STILL

03:49:29.021 --> 03:49:30.156
DO THE SAME BAD BEHAVIOR.

03:49:30.223 --> 03:49:32.658
IF THE ACLU WOULD AGREE TO THAT

03:49:32.725 --> 03:49:33.159
YOU KNOW IN MY CONSIDER

03:49:33.226 --> 03:49:34.594
REMINDING WELL I I I WOULD

03:49:34.660 --> 03:49:35.261
RATHER SEE HIM ARRESTED FOR

03:49:35.328 --> 03:49:36.863
THIRTY DAYS IF YOU'VE BEEN

03:49:36.929 --> 03:49:38.397
CONVICTED TWICE.

03:49:38.464 --> 03:49:41.534
EXHIBITION OF SPEED AND RECKLESS

03:49:41.601 --> 03:49:41.968
DRIVING [inaudible]

03:49:42.034 --> 03:49:53.613
THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:49:53.679 --> 03:49:54.780
OKAY.

03:49:54.847 --> 03:49:56.949
DO YOU HAVE A MOTION NOW.

03:49:57.016 --> 03:49:58.618
THIS ONE IS.

03:49:58.684 --> 03:50:00.553
OKAY EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS

03:50:00.620 --> 03:50:02.355
LAST TIME.

03:50:02.421 --> 03:50:06.225
SESSION WHEN WE APPROVED IN AND

03:50:06.292 --> 03:50:08.828
ARE THEN GOVERNOR HAD VETOED.

03:50:08.895 --> 03:50:10.930
ONE THIS BILL ONCE BUT A SIMILAR

03:50:10.997 --> 03:50:13.032
BILL THE PREVIOUS TIME SO

03:50:13.099 --> 03:50:14.400
THERE'S TWO VETOES ON IT.

03:50:14.467 --> 03:50:16.102
AND I FIND IT'S WHAT'S ALSO

03:50:16.169 --> 03:50:18.004
RIGHT INTERESTING IS THAT WE'VE

03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:19.872
JUST RECENTLY.

03:50:19.939 --> 03:50:21.807
I'M PASSED OUT WHAT LEASE OUT OF

03:50:21.874 --> 03:50:22.708
THIS COMMITTEE.

03:50:22.775 --> 03:50:24.710
SOME I AM.

03:50:24.777 --> 03:50:26.179
AT LEAST ONE BILL OF NOT MORE

03:50:26.245 --> 03:50:27.547
THAN.

03:50:27.613 --> 03:50:28.080
ONE AND I THINK THERE'S A

03:50:28.147 --> 03:50:30.016
DIFFERENT ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY

03:50:30.082 --> 03:50:30.316
THAT WOULD.

03:50:30.383 --> 03:50:34.353
I PUT LIMITS ON TOWING.

03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:39.158
AND WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT.

03:50:39.225 --> 03:50:40.560
IT'S NOT IN ALL CASES BY ANY

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:43.429
MEANS BUT THAT.

03:50:43.496 --> 03:50:44.897
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE YOUR

03:50:44.964 --> 03:50:46.799
BILL TOWED IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME.

03:50:46.866 --> 03:50:48.367
THERE'S CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS

03:50:48.434 --> 03:50:50.336
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE YOU

03:50:50.403 --> 03:50:52.738
KNOW A BILL OF VEHICLE IMPOUNDED.

03:50:52.805 --> 03:50:54.340
OR TOWED [inaudible]

03:50:54.407 --> 03:50:57.777
AND AND THEN.

03:50:57.843 --> 03:51:01.113
THE THE IMPACT IS THAT MUCH MORE

03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:01.347
SEVERE.

03:51:01.414 --> 03:51:03.950
BECAUSE OF THE COST TO THE

03:51:04.016 --> 03:51:05.151
INDIVIDUAL.

03:51:05.218 --> 03:51:07.053
BECAUSE OF THEIR POTENTIAL

03:51:07.119 --> 03:51:09.288
IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO GO TO

03:51:09.355 --> 03:51:10.990
WORK IN SUCH.

03:51:11.057 --> 03:51:12.391
WERE.

03:51:12.458 --> 03:51:14.026
THE CARS THEIR LIVELIHOOD.

03:51:14.093 --> 03:51:15.695
SO THESE ARE TRICKY SO I I

03:51:15.761 --> 03:51:18.698
UNDERSTAND YOUR OBJECTIVES.

03:51:18.764 --> 03:51:21.400
AND I DID SUPPORT THE BILL LAST

03:51:21.467 --> 03:51:25.104
YEAR -- AT VARIETY.

03:51:25.171 --> 03:51:26.839
IT.

03:51:26.906 --> 03:51:28.941
IT'S THE I'M NOT SURE IT'LL BE A

03:51:29.008 --> 03:51:30.943
DETERRENT.

03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:32.645
I'M IN FACT I'M PRETTY POSITIVE

03:51:32.712 --> 03:51:34.747
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A DETERRENT

03:51:34.814 --> 03:51:34.947
NOW.

03:51:35.014 --> 03:51:35.848
WHETHER IT.

03:51:35.915 --> 03:51:38.851
IT WOULD TEMPORARILY STOPPED.

03:51:38.918 --> 03:51:40.186
IF THE FOR THOSE WHO GET

03:51:40.253 --> 03:51:42.488
IMPOUNDED YEAH WOULD TEMPORARILY

03:51:42.555 --> 03:51:44.190
STOP THEM FROM WHATEVER THEY'RE

03:51:44.257 --> 03:51:45.858
ENGAGED IN.

03:51:45.925 --> 03:51:47.593
WHETHER IT OVERALL STOP THE

03:51:47.660 --> 03:51:49.495
DANGEROUS TO RECKLESS DRIVING SO

03:51:49.562 --> 03:51:52.331
THESE ARE THE TRICKY THINGS AND

03:51:52.398 --> 03:51:54.567
I I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

03:51:54.634 --> 03:51:56.836
IMPOSING A MEMBER RIGHT NOW BUT

03:51:56.902 --> 03:51:58.104
I THINK.

03:51:58.170 --> 03:51:59.338
IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING WHETHER

03:51:59.405 --> 03:52:01.207
IT'S THE HIGHER NUMBER OF

03:52:01.274 --> 03:52:02.942
INCIDENTS TO BE A REQUIRED

03:52:03.009 --> 03:52:05.278
IMPOUNDMENT OF THIRTY DAYS AND I

03:52:05.344 --> 03:52:07.213
THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS WORTH

03:52:07.280 --> 03:52:09.515
CONSIDERING. TO BALANCE THE

03:52:09.582 --> 03:52:11.083
OBJECTIVE YOU HAVE IN.

03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:14.954
THE KNOWING WHO IS LIKELY.

03:52:15.021 --> 03:52:18.190
TO BE IMPACTED BY IT.

03:52:18.257 --> 03:52:19.659
BUT GO AHEAD ALL TO SAY THAT.

03:52:19.725 --> 03:52:20.960
ONE OF THE REASONS DEVELOP THE

03:52:21.027 --> 03:52:22.028
BILL THE WE DID WE WE DID

03:52:22.094 --> 03:52:24.263
BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT THE

03:52:24.330 --> 03:52:25.931
PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING A LOT OF

03:52:25.998 --> 03:52:27.233
THESE HIGH FINES ARE ACTUALLY

03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:28.968
NOT LOW INCOME PEOPLE THEIR HIGH

03:52:29.035 --> 03:52:30.536
INCOME PEOPLE.

03:52:30.603 --> 03:52:31.137
THERE ARE THE CHILDREN OF HIGH

03:52:31.203 --> 03:52:32.204
INCOME PEOPLE AND WHAT THE

03:52:32.271 --> 03:52:33.205
POLICE WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IS

03:52:33.272 --> 03:52:34.407
THAT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING

03:52:34.473 --> 03:52:35.741
THE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINES OVER

03:52:35.808 --> 03:52:37.043
AND OVER AGAIN THEY'RE GIVING

03:52:37.109 --> 03:52:38.911
THE SAME FINE TO THE SAME YOUNG

03:52:38.978 --> 03:52:39.845
PEOPLE.

03:52:39.912 --> 03:52:40.713
WHO ARE COMMITTING A LOT OF

03:52:40.780 --> 03:52:41.814
THESE OFFENSES AND THERE ARE

03:52:41.881 --> 03:52:42.848
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF

03:52:42.915 --> 03:52:44.150
DISPOSABLE WELL?

03:52:44.216 --> 03:52:45.718
THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY IT.

03:52:45.785 --> 03:52:47.586
I'M SO IT'S SIR IT'S A AND I'M

03:52:47.653 --> 03:52:49.188
NOT TRYING TO ARGUE THAT THERE

03:52:49.255 --> 03:52:51.957
AREN'T DISPROPORTIONAL THESE OF

03:52:52.024 --> 03:52:54.193
OF PENALTIES IN A LOT OF PLACES.

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:56.095
MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

03:52:56.162 --> 03:52:57.763
ISSUE AND IN MY DISTRICT HAS

03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:59.665
BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF THE

03:52:59.732 --> 03:53:00.333
OPPOSITE WE DEVELOP THIS BECAUSE

03:53:00.399 --> 03:53:00.966
WE'VE.

03:53:01.033 --> 03:53:02.735
THE MONETARY FINE WAS NOT REALLY

03:53:02.802 --> 03:53:03.936
AFFECTING THIS GROUP OF A

03:53:04.003 --> 03:53:05.271
POPULATION OF IS COMMITTING A

03:53:05.338 --> 03:53:06.505
LOT OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME BUT

03:53:06.572 --> 03:53:08.040
THE TAKING THE CAR AWAY WAS A

03:53:08.107 --> 03:53:09.608
VERY BIG DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM.

03:53:09.675 --> 03:53:11.210
BECAUSE THAT CAR IS IS A STATUS

03:53:11.277 --> 03:53:12.945
SYMBOL IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW

03:53:13.012 --> 03:53:13.713
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

03:53:13.779 --> 03:53:15.414
TO THEM AND ALSO THE ABILITY

03:53:15.481 --> 03:53:17.516
THAT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. TO

03:53:17.583 --> 03:53:19.151
HAVE  LEGAL MODIFICATIONS HAVE

03:53:19.218 --> 03:53:20.219
TO BE REMOVED BEFORE THE CAR

03:53:20.286 --> 03:53:21.620
COMES BACK THAT DOESN'T EXIST

03:53:21.687 --> 03:53:22.655
ANYWHERE NOW IN LAW.

03:53:22.722 --> 03:53:23.956
SO IN TERMS OF THE STREET RACING

03:53:24.023 --> 03:53:25.458
VEHICLES THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

03:53:25.524 --> 03:53:26.559
BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING A VEHICLE

03:53:26.625 --> 03:53:28.794
THAT'S BEEN TRICKED OUT TO GO

03:53:28.861 --> 03:53:29.362
THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR

03:53:29.428 --> 03:53:30.096
WHATEVER THEY DO.

03:53:30.162 --> 03:53:31.197
AND YOU'RE HAVING IT TURN BACK

03:53:31.263 --> 03:53:33.332
INTO A CAR THAT'S JUST A NORMAL

03:53:33.399 --> 03:53:33.933
CAR.

03:53:33.999 --> 03:53:36.035
SO THIS I THINK THAT IT'S WORTH

03:53:36.102 --> 03:53:37.203
TRYING THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE

03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:38.671
PEOPLE TO WHOM THE FINE DOESN'T

03:53:38.738 --> 03:53:40.039
MATTER AND BECAUSE THE BILL

03:53:40.106 --> 03:53:41.874
STILL HAS THAT OUT FOR PEOPLE TO

03:53:41.941 --> 03:53:43.709
WHERE IT'S A HARDSHIP.

03:53:43.776 --> 03:53:44.944
ON I THINK THAT.

03:53:45.010 --> 03:53:46.445
IN SOME WAYS I'D SAY THAT THIS

03:53:46.512 --> 03:53:48.013
IS FLIPPING THAT AROUND AND

03:53:48.080 --> 03:53:49.582
GETTING PEOPLE.

03:53:49.648 --> 03:53:51.083
I'M IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO YOU

03:53:51.150 --> 03:53:51.717
KNOW DO YOU HAVE THE PRESSURE

03:53:51.784 --> 03:53:54.320
POINT OF MAYBE NOT ENGAGING IN

03:53:54.387 --> 03:53:55.020
THIS BEHAVIOR IF THEY THINK

03:53:55.087 --> 03:53:55.855
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THE

03:53:55.921 --> 03:53:59.592
VEHICLE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM

03:53:59.658 --> 03:54:01.827
EVEN FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME

03:54:01.894 --> 03:54:02.128
[inaudible]

03:54:02.194 --> 03:54:03.796
SURE.

03:54:03.863 --> 03:54:04.997
HE WON A CLOSE SOURCE THAT IS

03:54:05.064 --> 03:54:05.331
YOUR CLOTHES.

03:54:05.398 --> 03:54:06.866
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW I

03:54:06.932 --> 03:54:08.134
VOTED FOR THE BILL THAT YOU'RE

03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:09.402
TALKING ABOUT WITH THE TOWING

03:54:09.468 --> 03:54:10.803
BILL BECAUSE TO ME THAT THIS NO

03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:13.172
IT'S PUNITIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO'S

03:54:13.239 --> 03:54:14.640
JUST NOT PAYING THE BILL.

03:54:14.707 --> 03:54:16.475
INCREASE THAT DEBT BUT AGAIN

03:54:16.542 --> 03:54:17.543
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING

03:54:17.610 --> 03:54:18.544
SOMETHING THAT WHICH IS A

03:54:18.611 --> 03:54:20.012
PRIVILEGE WHICH IS DRIVING.

03:54:20.079 --> 03:54:22.681
AND NOT JUST ONCE BUT TWICE NOW --

03:54:22.748 --> 03:54:24.617
DRIVING IN A WAY THAT IS TURNING

03:54:24.683 --> 03:54:26.819
THAT VEHICLE INTO A WEAPON AND

03:54:26.886 --> 03:54:29.288
WE DO NEED TO USE ALL THOSE

TECHNOLOGIES BUT IN A MANNER

03:57:37.977 --> 03:57:38.978
THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM.

03:57:39.044 --> 03:57:41.113

CURRENT ASSIGNMENT I OVERSEE OUR

03:57:52.558 --> 03:57:55.060
COUNTIES CRIME STRATEGIES UNIT

POLICE AGENCIES AND I RUN A

03:57:59.598 --> 03:58:00.132
LARGE CRIME THAT INTELLIGENCE

03:58:00.199 --> 03:58:02.768
CENTER REALLY THE BECAUSE OF OUR

03:58:02.835 --> 03:58:04.336
COUNTIES EFFORT IS A REDUCTION

03:58:04.403 --> 03:58:05.738
IN GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS EVIDENCE

03:58:05.804 --> 03:58:06.472
BASED.

03:58:06.538 --> 03:58:07.940
USING A PROVEN METHOD THAT IS A

03:58:08.007 --> 03:58:10.142
NATIONAL DATABASE OF BALLISTIC

03:58:10.209 --> 03:58:10.976
IMAGES.

03:58:11.043 --> 03:58:13.078
THIS EVEN THE OPPONENTS TO THIS

03:58:13.145 --> 03:58:14.013
BILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

03:58:14.079 --> 03:58:15.447
TECHNOLOGY THAT COMPARES

03:58:15.514 --> 03:58:17.449
EXPENDED SHELL CASINGS FROM

03:58:17.516 --> 03:58:18.984
SHOOTINGS WORKS IT SOLVES

03:58:19.051 --> 03:58:20.552
DRAMATIC CRIMES IN OUR

03:58:20.619 --> 03:58:21.820
JURISDICTION WE MOVED TO A

03:58:21.887 --> 03:58:24.123
UNIVERSAL USE OF THIS TOOL IT

03:58:24.189 --> 03:58:25.724
DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF NINE IN

03:58:25.791 --> 03:58:26.625
LEEDS AND HAD.

03:58:26.692 --> 03:58:28.527
GOT INCLUDING SOLVING NINE

03:58:28.594 --> 03:58:30.496
MURDERS IN A SINGLE YEAR WHICH

03:58:30.562 --> 03:58:32.097
FOR OUR JURISDICTION IS A LOT WE

03:58:32.164 --> 03:58:33.766
ONLY ABOUT THIRTY MURDERS A YEAR.

03:58:33.832 --> 03:58:35.401
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

03:58:35.467 --> 03:58:36.769
BUT SINCE I CAME HERE LAST YEAR

03:58:36.835 --> 03:58:38.671
I THINK ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF

03:58:38.737 --> 03:58:41.006
THE BILL LAST YEAR -- WAS TO

03:58:41.073 --> 03:58:42.408
REALLY TWO FOLD ONE WAS THE FACT

03:58:42.474 --> 03:58:44.309
THAT IT'S A MANDATE AND THE

03:58:44.376 --> 03:58:45.177
SECOND WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S

03:58:45.244 --> 03:58:48.047
COSTLY -- IT IS OUR POSITION

03:58:48.113 --> 03:58:49.982
THAT -- TO TO URBAN CENTERS WHO

03:58:50.049 --> 03:58:51.550
WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS WHO ARE

03:58:51.617 --> 03:58:53.952
EXPERIENCING DAILY TRAGEDY AND

03:58:54.019 --> 03:58:56.121
BLOOD SHED AT THE HANDS OF GUNS

03:58:56.188 --> 03:58:58.123
IT IS WELL WORTH THE EXPENDITURE

03:58:58.190 --> 03:59:00.325
TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN AUGMENT

03:59:00.392 --> 03:59:01.994
AND UNIVERSALLY SUBMIT THIS

03:59:02.061 --> 03:59:02.995
EVIDENCE.

03:59:03.062 --> 03:59:04.563
AND IS WELL WORTH THE COST I

03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:05.431
THINK THAT WHAT'S REALLY

03:59:05.497 --> 03:59:07.266
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT

03:59:07.332 --> 03:59:08.934
PRINT BRINGS THIS TECHNOLOGY TO

03:59:09.001 --> 03:59:11.003
OUR SMALL OR RURAL AREAS THAT

03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:13.806
MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE ACCESS.

03:59:13.872 --> 03:59:15.274
TO A LOCAL LAB SO REALLY --

03:59:15.340 --> 03:59:16.809
BUTTRESSES THE ABILITY FOR THE

03:59:16.875 --> 03:59:18.177
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE

03:59:18.243 --> 03:59:20.579
THIS TO OUR NON URBAN CENTERS

03:59:20.646 --> 03:59:22.181
BUT IN OUR LARGEST POPULATION

03:59:22.247 --> 03:59:23.749
BASES THERE ARE ALREADY USING

03:59:23.816 --> 03:59:24.817
THIS TECHNOLOGY.

03:59:24.883 --> 03:59:26.218
ISSUES ARE NOT USING IT

03:59:26.285 --> 03:59:27.886
UNIVERSALLY IS THE REASON IT'S A

03:59:27.953 --> 03:59:30.089
MANDATE IS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

03:59:30.155 --> 03:59:30.589
MAKE THEM DO IT.

03:59:30.656 --> 03:59:31.390
THEY WON'T.

03:59:31.457 --> 03:59:32.958
AND SO SINCE I CAME HERE LAST

03:59:33.025 --> 03:59:34.259
YEAR AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS

03:59:34.326 --> 03:59:35.994
BODY WE'VE HAD TWO MURDERS WHERE

03:59:36.061 --> 03:59:37.930
IT LITERALLY ARMOR WEAPON WAS

03:59:37.996 --> 03:59:39.698
SITTING ON TESTED ON A SHELF.

03:59:39.765 --> 03:59:40.733
AND WE FOUND IT AND WE GOT IT

03:59:40.799 --> 03:59:42.735
TESTED THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

03:59:42.801 --> 03:59:44.203
OTHER JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE

03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:49.842
THE SAME URGENCY WITH A

03:59:49.908 --> 03:59:51.376
RECOVERED WEAPON.

03:59:51.443 --> 03:59:51.877
AS YOU DO IN YOUR MURDER

03:59:51.944 --> 03:59:52.611
INVESTIGATION THAT'S WHY WE'RE

03:59:52.678 --> 03:59:54.379
ASKING FOR IT TO BE A MANDATORY

03:59:54.446 --> 03:59:55.581
IS SOLVES CASES IT LITERALLY PUT

03:59:55.647 --> 03:59:56.215
SHOOTERS WHO HAVE USED A GUN BY

03:59:56.281 --> 03:59:57.449
DEFINITION MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND

03:59:57.516 --> 03:59:58.851
BARS AND SOLVE THESE CASES.

03:59:58.917 --> 04:00:00.385
IMPORTANTLY -- I THINK IT BRINGS

04:00:00.452 --> 04:00:02.454
THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PARTS OF THE

04:00:02.521 --> 04:00:04.056
STATE THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T

04:00:04.123 --> 04:00:05.157
HAVE ACCESS TO ITS WITH IT'S

04:00:05.224 --> 04:00:07.226
WELL WORTH THE COST OR TO SAVE

04:00:07.292 --> 04:00:09.595
THE LIVES.

04:00:09.661 --> 04:00:11.230
THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN

04:02:51.857 --> 04:02:52.424
THAT.

WOULD NEED AND WANT ET OUR DATA.

04:11:05.116 --> 04:11:05.650
UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY CANNOT

04:11:17.095 --> 04:11:18.062
LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD STILL NEED

PERCENT.

04:11:40.585 --> 04:11:42.287

REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN

04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:33.705
CALIFORNIA LAWN SEARCH WARRANTS

THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE

PROTECTED FROM UNREASONABLE

04:12:38.176 --> 04:12:39.644
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT SEARCHES

04:12:39.711 --> 04:12:40.745
AND SEIZURES.

04:12:40.812 --> 04:12:42.814
AND THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:12:42.881 --> 04:12:44.449
TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES.

04:12:44.516 --> 04:12:45.917
ONE WAY THAT OUR LAW DOES THIS

04:12:45.984 --> 04:12:47.218
IS BY SETTING A GENERAL RULE

04:12:47.285 --> 04:12:49.187
THAT A WARRANT CAN BE SOUGHT

04:12:49.254 --> 04:12:50.822
WHEN THE EVIDENCE TO BE SEIZE.

04:12:50.889 --> 04:12:52.657
IS EVIDENCE OF A FELONY THERE IS

04:12:52.724 --> 04:12:54.292
NO GENERAL PROVISION ALLOWING

04:12:54.359 --> 04:12:55.426
ISSUANCE OF A SEARCH WARRANT

04:12:55.493 --> 04:12:58.830
WHERE THE THING TO BE SEIZED AS

04:12:58.897 --> 04:12:59.597
EVIDENCE OF A LESSER CRIME.

04:12:59.664 --> 04:13:01.032
AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD

04:13:01.099 --> 04:13:02.066
ALLOW THE ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT

04:13:02.133 --> 04:13:03.668
FOR INFORMATION FROM A VEHICLE'S

04:13:03.735 --> 04:13:04.669
RECORDING DEVICE THAT

04:13:04.736 --> 04:13:07.272
CONSTITUTES EVIDENCE OF ANY.

04:13:07.338 --> 04:13:10.008
MISDEMEANOR AS AMENDED INVOLVING

04:13:10.074 --> 04:13:11.876
A MOTOR VEHICLE.

04:13:11.943 --> 04:13:13.811
ADD CRASH RESULT.

04:13:13.878 --> 04:13:15.179
DEATH OR BODILY INJURY.

04:13:15.246 --> 04:13:16.814
BY ALLOWING THE INCH ISSUANCE OF

04:13:16.881 --> 04:13:17.849
A WARRANT FOR INFORMATION

04:13:17.916 --> 04:13:19.117
AVAILABLE FROM A VEHICLE

04:13:19.183 --> 04:13:20.818
RECORDING DEVICE FOR NON FELONY

04:13:20.885 --> 04:13:21.886
OFFENSE.

04:13:21.953 --> 04:13:24.255
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT A. B.

04:13:24.322 --> 04:13:25.056
SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT UPSETS THE

04:13:25.123 --> 04:13:26.558
BALANCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF

04:13:26.624 --> 04:13:28.393
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND THE

04:13:28.459 --> 04:13:29.694
INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS

04:13:29.761 --> 04:13:30.929
AND PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY I

04:13:30.995 --> 04:13:32.864
WOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS DOES

04:13:32.931 --> 04:13:34.899
NOT APPLY ONLY WHERE -- THE

04:13:34.966 --> 04:13:36.868
DRIVER IS THAT YOU KNOW DEAD OR

04:13:36.935 --> 04:13:39.337
UNCONSCIOUS BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW

04:13:39.404 --> 04:13:41.205
ISSUANCE OF A SEARCH WARRANT TO

04:13:41.272 --> 04:13:42.407
GET THAT INFORMATION OR THE

04:13:42.473 --> 04:13:44.509
DRIVER SIMPLY DOES NOT WANT.

04:13:44.576 --> 04:13:46.477
IT TO BE SHARED -- AND I WOULD

04:13:46.544 --> 04:13:47.545
ALSO POINT OUT THAT.

04:13:47.612 --> 04:13:48.613
YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE

04:13:48.680 --> 04:13:49.547
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING BEING

04:13:49.614 --> 04:13:52.083
NECESSARY TO AN INVESTIGATION

04:13:52.150 --> 04:13:53.585
THIS IS INFORMATION THAT THAT

04:13:53.651 --> 04:13:55.787
SIMPLY DIDN'T EXIST -- NOT THAT

04:13:55.853 --> 04:13:57.522
VERY LONG AGO I AND YET

04:13:57.589 --> 04:13:59.991
INVESTIGATIONS MOVE FORWARD TO

04:14:00.058 --> 04:14:03.094
AND IN MANY CASES WERE PERFECTLY.

04:14:03.161 --> 04:14:05.229
CAPABLE OF OF RESOLVING WHAT HAD

04:14:05.296 --> 04:14:08.866
HAPPENED IN THE INCIDENT WE ASK

04:14:08.933 --> 04:14:11.269
FOR YOUR NOVEL -- LET'S SEE IF
