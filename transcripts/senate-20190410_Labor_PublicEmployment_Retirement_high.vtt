00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.057
WITH SOME DRAWBACKS PARTICULARLY

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.492
WHEN YOU ARE.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.927

WITH THE INDUSTRY TO UPGRADE THE

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.574
CONDITIONS ON THE JOB SITE BUT

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.942
ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.344
ATTRITION PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN.

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.513
IS THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.216
THEY DO A CONFRONT ON THE JOB

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:40.719
SITE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT SB.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:41.987
FIVE THIRTY IS A U. S.

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:44.056
SIGNIFICANT TOOL TO BRING

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:45.557
CONTRACTORS TO THE TABLE BECAUSE

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.226
WE BELIEVE THAT CONTRACTORS HAVE

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.761
A VERY POSITIVE ROLE. TO PLAY

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.331
WITH THE TRUCK IN CREATING A

ON THE JOB SITE AND NOT ONE

ON THEIR YEARLY WE TREAT WE

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:01.640
THINK THAT DIFFERENCE IS REALLY

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:04.710
IMPORTANT LAST YEAR THE

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.045

E. O. REQUIREMENTS AN

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.616
APPRENTICESHIP WE BELIEVE THAT

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.150
THIS BILL WOULD PARTNER VERY

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:14.386
NICELY WITH THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.388

THE INDUSTRY SPECIFICITY.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.192

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.599
DEALER SEE CONCERN BECAUSE IT

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.568

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:32.204
SPECIFICITY OF THE INDUSTRY.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.906

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:15.100
THEN HAVE WHATEVER EVALUATION

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.169

WEATHERED ACTUALLY IS WORKING.

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:22.741
AND AND A TV IN THAT SHOW OF

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:23.608
MAYBE A LITTLE TIME.

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:25.043
SPREAD BEFORE THAT THAT STARCH

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.445
AND CAN CAN LOOK AT THAT WOULD

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.046
BE APPROPRIATE AND WE CAN TALK

APPRECIATE THE VALUATION BUT I

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.757
THINK THE ULTIMATE TEST IS WHEN

THE CULTURE SHIFT IN WORK SPACES

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:43.595

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.201
DIRECTLY THAT'S THE ULTIMATE

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:50.502

AND DECREASED THEIR UTILIZATION

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:06.184
THESE ACTIVITIES OCCUR WITHOUT

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:12.290

AND DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE IS

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.871

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.608
SO THESE PRACTICES RESULT IN IN

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.810
A FEDERAL LAWSUIT WHICH MISTER

THE SAME PRACTICES.

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:51.830
SO ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF FIVE

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:52.497

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:53.932

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:56.768
IT ALSO PROMOTES THE ABILITY OF

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.411

NEEDS TO BE SWORN IN JANUARY.

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.965
THE DISK MOST WAS THE PEOPLE IT

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:37.067
WAS FAIR AGAIN AYE AYE WE WERE

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:39.570
HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE AND WE

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.205
WERE DEBATING THIS AFTER THEY

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.406
HAD WON THE ELECTION.

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:43.841
THEY WANT THEIR ELECTION THEY

OH NO WE'RE CHANGING THE RULES

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.246
SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THAT

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:51.949
POINT OF VIEW IT'S IT'S FOR THE

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:52.149
BELT.

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:54.618
AS WE CAN DISABLE NO THAT'S WOOD

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.920
CHIPS FELL BUT IT WAS JUST

00:40:55.986 --> 00:41:07.264
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF JUDGES.

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.967
NOT FILLING VACANCIES BY WAY.

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.202
THERE WERE VACANCIES THAT WERE

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:14.004
AVAILABLE THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:14.205
BUILD.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.272
THESE WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT ONE

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.241
SO IS IT A DOUBLE WHAMMY UNDER

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.043
JUST IN THE WAY THAT THE COURTS

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:25.850
TO SEE PEOPLE SO WHICH LOVE YOUR

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.284
INTEREST IN A LAW FIRM YOU'VE.

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.919
RESIGNED FROM THE NONPROFIT

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:29.954
WHATEVER IT IS IT'S A

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.723
PARTICULARLY FINAL KINDS OF KIND

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.092
OF THING THAT PEOPLE DO WHEN

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:39.096
THEY WHEN THESE JUDGE.

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:41.799
VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND IN A I I

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:42.900
WOULD AGREE WITH THE THE

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:44.368
ANALYSIS AND CERTAINLY WITH THE

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.569
THE COMMENT TO ME THIS IS AN

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.304
ANOMALY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.039
THAT THAT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:50.708
IS NOT PRESIDENT SETTING.

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.076
AN ON THE RECORD THAT WE KNOW

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.911
THAT BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.479
TIMING AND BECAUSE OF WHEN.

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.815
SOMEONE TAKES OFFICE -- IT DID

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.516
CREATE A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE I

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.417
DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD HAVE

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.219
CHANGED THEIR MIND AFTER THE

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.621
ELECTION AND AN HOUR AFTER

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:06.190
PREPARA BUT THE POINT IS THAT

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.258
WAS IN THE ORIGINAL DEAL AND

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.192
WE'VE WE'VE.

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.326
KIND OF DONE THAT WITH ALL OF

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:11.362
OUR EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.697
DON'T CHANGE THE RULES AFTER --

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.332
FOR RETIREMENT AND WE'VE WE'VE

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:17.134
NOT DONE THAT AND IN MANY CASES

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.303
SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S AN HONEST

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.771
AND AND FAIR.

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:23.173
APPROACH AND AND WE ARE TALKING

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.342
ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT INDIVIDUALS

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:26.877
AND AND YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR.

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:27.711
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU THAT

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.947
THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:32.182
INSTANCES WHERE THE ELECTION WAS

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:45.329
PRIOR TO THE THE EPUB OF

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.097
MEANINGFUL VIA COME INTO PLAY

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:48.766
ARE BECOMING LAW.

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:51.201
AND I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.136
THING TO DO SO I APPRECIATE THAT

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:54.471
WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM A

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.073

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:57.641
SPEAK.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.076
PRESIDENT'S HEADING FOR ANY

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.878
OTHER SORT OF SUCH AS STATE --

COMPENSATION SYSTEM I THINK THE

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.314
ANALYSIS FAIRLY POINTS OUT THAT

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:26.250
THIS DOES PUT A THUMB ON THE

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:26.950

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.886
OF BY SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.420

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:45.669
BUT THAT THE LEVEL OF COURAGE IN

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.004
THE CURRENT DETERRENT.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.873

AROUND THIS KIND OF WORK.

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.311
IMPEDE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO

MAKES IT.

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.931
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NOT A LOT

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:15.566
OF FOLKS WANT TO ADMIT.

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.067

SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR IN OUR

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.489

QUICKLY IF I CAN'T TO THE STIGMA

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:18.861
AND CULTURE ISSUES THAT WERE

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.763
RAISED -- I KNOW MY ASSOCIATIONS

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.198

BUT WITH RESPECT TO SB.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:30.173
FIVE FORTY TWO AS ABOUT THE

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:31.274
OPERATION OF THE WORKERS

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:31.741
COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:33.276
KIND OF IN A IN A RATHER MUNDANE

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.644
INSURANCE.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.546
TERMS -- SO THAT'S WHERE I WANT

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:40.550
TO FOCUS.

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.385
VERY SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.719
LOOKING AT PRESUMPTIONS AND THE

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.288
ANALYSIS POINTS THIS OUT ONE OF

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.355
THE THINGS WE LIKE TO LOOK AT IS

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.590
WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.891
EXISTING WORKERS COMPENSATION

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.426
SYSTEM HOW IS THE SYSTEM

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.728
TREATING THE WORKERS -- FOR

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:53.296
WHICH THE PRESUMPTION WOULD

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.430
APPLY.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.799
AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE --

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:57.700
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.168
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.204
SO THOROUGHLY STUDY THERE IS NO

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.572
DATA OUT THERE.

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.606
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THESE

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.474
SPECIFIC TYPES OF CLAIMS FOR

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.475
THESE SPECIFIC TYPES OF WORKERS

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.743
ARE PROBLEM IN THE WORKERS

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.111
COMPENSATION SYSTEM

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.513
IF THAT DATA WERE TO ARISE WE

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.048
WOULD BE HAPPY TO EXAMINE IT AND

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.216
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MORE

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.351
CLEARLY BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:16.819
IT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST.

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:18.020
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.722
OBVIOUSLY BECOMES WHY DO WHY DO

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:20.289
WE CARE WHY DOES IT.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:22.058
WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:24.694
SAID WHY IS THE DATA MATTER.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.162
AND AGAIN THE THE ANALYSIS DOES

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:26.929
A PRETTY GOOD JOB YOU'RE

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.065
POINTING OUT -- SOME KEY FACTORS

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:32.935
THIS REALLY IS -- A DEPARTURE

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:33.836
FROM THE SORT OF GRAND BARGAIN

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:35.338
THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.973
AGREE TO IT BEGINNING AT THE

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.907
SYSTEM IS KIND OF THE

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.041
UNDERPINNING OF THE ENTIRE

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.643
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THIS

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.278
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAT WE WE

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.780
WE AGREE -- TO AND SECOND THE

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.782
THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:49.118
PSYCHIATRIC THAT CURRENT LAW ON

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.987
PSYCHIATRIC INJURIES EXISTS --

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.221
BECAUSE THERE WAS WELL

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:53.689
DOCUMENTED FRAUD AND THE CLAIMS

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.791
ARE A MAJOR COST DRIVER EVEN

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.293
THOUGH THEY WERE FILED WHEN THE

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.361
INJURY WAS LARGELY DUE TO NON

01:04:58.427 --> 01:04:59.695
OCCUPATIONAL INJURY.

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.364
INJURIES ARE FACTORS AND THIS IS

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.365
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS IN THE

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.567
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.168
WE NEED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.703
TO WE HAVE THE ABILITY VERY

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.505
CLEARLY IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.407
DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS -- SOME OF

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.975
THE BEST REFORMS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.343
FOR THE TRENDS TOWARDS REFORM

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.611
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.946
REALLY BEEN ON EMPLOYERS

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:18.281
EMPLOYEES GETTING TOGETHER.

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:20.049
AND MAKING WISE DECISIONS BASED

01:05:20.116 --> 01:05:21.884
ON DATA I THINK WITH RESPECT TO

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.487

DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.213
