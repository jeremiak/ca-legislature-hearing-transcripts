THE SUBCOMMITTEE. NUMBER TWO ON RESOURCES ENVIRO PROTECTION AND TRANSPORTATION TO ORDER WE'RE GONNA CHRISSY THIS IS SUBCOMMITTEE UNTIL WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM I WILL TAKE. SOME DISCUSSION ITEMS FIRST WOULD LIKE THIS START WITH A THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PRESENTATION IF -- I SEE MR INNIS IS [inaudible] PENDING DEPUTY. I IN THIS HERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME FOR DISABILITY ITEM NUMBER -- SEVEN YEAH THIS IS THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT -- THINGS UP. L. A. L. THANK YOU. THIS IS WE HAVE A OUR TOMBS THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT IN THE EARLY A TRAIN OPERATOR REPORT THANK YOU. FOR ALLOWING ME NOT TO WATCH SECOND HALF THE WARRIORS GAME YESTERDAY SO I GET. TRY TO GET. THIS DONE BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE LIFE I'M LEADING NOW OKAY [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. I GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BUT A PENNY MY START DATE THERE I COME TO YOU TODAY STILL AS A SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION AT THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AND JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A JAMIE METALLICA WHOSE -- WITH THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL IN THAT THE BUDGET OFFICER -- THAT COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HIGH SPEED. EARLY DEBATES WORDS FOR IT TO BE IN THAT. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SO HERE WE GO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I HAVE N IS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR THE TWENTY AT NINETEEN A PROJECT UPDATE REPORT TAKING OUT RECENTLY ON MAY MAY pNEWSOME'S APPROACH TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. VISION HE FIRST LAID OUT IN THE STATE OF THE STATE IN FEBRUARY. THAT VISION GETS HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS ON THE GROUND AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. LIVES WITHIN OUR FISCAL MEANS AND REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL CONNECTING TO THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OBJECT UPDATE REPORT ADDRESSES STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTING ELEMENTS SUCH AS UPDATES ON COST ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RISKS. ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR'S PROJECT UP A REPORT INCLUDES INFORMATION AT THE OF THIRTY COMMITTED TO INCLUDE AT THE TIME OF LAST YEAR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. FIRST THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN INDICATED A FUNDING GAP FOR THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT. THERE WAS THE COST OF TIME IN THE PROJECT -- PASSED BETWEEN YOUR IN MADERA. THIRTY INDICATED THE TWENTY NINETEEN PER WOULD INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EARLY INTERNALIZED RAIL SERVICES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SEPARATELY. ON THE GALLERY TO SAN FRANCISCO SEGMENT. THAT ANALYSIS INDICATES THE BEST SEGMENT FOR EARLY IN ARMS SERVICE IS THE MERCED BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. THAT SEGMENT WOULD DECREASE STRIP TIMES BY NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED MINUTES AND ABOUT DOUBLE RAIL RIDERSHIP ACROSS ACE THE SAN JOAQUIN'S. AND THE NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. A SECOND THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REVIEW THE CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND PERFORMED A BENCHMARKING EXERCISE. FOCUSED ON CAST COST CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LOCATION DEPENDENCE INSIST TUNNELS INVITED AXE. AND COMPARE THAT TO COST EXPERIENCE ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD AT THAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST SAVINGS WHICH WILL BE FURTHER EXPLORED DURING PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING AND FINAL DESIGN PHASES. LASTLY OF FORTY COMPLETED A MORE RIGOROUS RISK EVALUATION AND MADE UPDATES TO CENTRAL VALLEY COST ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES INCREASE THE CONTINGENCY FROM ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND INCLUDED SOME SCOPE INCREASES. INCREASING THE PROJECT COST ABOUT THREE POINT 5% OR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION AN INCREASE AND SOME INCREASES IN COSTS. THERE WERE FIVE FOUR POINT 5% OR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. AND THESE INCLUDE ITEMS LIKE INTRUSION BARRIERS LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND TRACKS AND SYSTEMS. AS FOR THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT FOCUSES THE EXISTING FUNDING RESOURCES THE STATE IS IDENTIFIED TO GET A SECTION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL UP AND RUNNING. THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THE BROADER PROJECT SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT PROPOSES BUILDING THE MERCED. FRESNO BAKERSFIELD LINE A BUILDING BLOCK THAT MATCHES THE AVAILABLE FUNDS WE HAVE. AND IS BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE TODAY. THE SAME TIME THE PROJECT AT THE REPORT MAINTAINS EXISTING COMMITMENTS TO BOOK AND PROJECTS IN THE COMPLETION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. ON THE ENTIRE SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM SEGMENT. SO WHEN THESE INVESTMENTS ARE COMPLETED THE STATE WILL HAVE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL SET OF RAIL IMPROVEMENTS. CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION IN THE BAY AREA ON A FIFTY MILE SEGMENT INITIALLY IS BY CALTRAIN AND LATER SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. THAT INVESTMENT INCREASES SPEEDS CAPACITY IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY AND AS SOME STUDY SHOWING CRUZ IMPROVES PROPERTY VALUES ALONG THE STATIONS. CENTRAL VALLEY HIGH SPEED RAIL INTERIM SERVICE ON A HUNDRED SEVENTY MY ONE MILE SEGMENT LINKING THE MAJOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CITIES. GETTING HIGH SPEED TRAINS UP AND OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. AND LASTLY LA UNION STATION. A RENTER TRACKS AT LA UNION STATION AND THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATION INCREASING SPEEDS AND CAPACITIES. THROUGH ALLEY THE TWO LOS ANGELES INITIALLY BENEFITING METROLINK AND SURFLINER AMTRAK BUT LATER SHARED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE VALLEY TO VALLEY VISION OF HIGH SPEED -- I BELIEVE CENTRAL VALLEY BUILDING BLOCK IS A TANGIBLE NEXT STEP TO REALIZING THAT VISION. TO MAKE THE FULL SAN FRANCISCO DALY ANAHEIM SYSTEM A REALITY WE FIRST NEED TO BUILD A WORKING SEGMENT TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH SPEED RAIL TO CALIFORNIANS. THIS PROJECT UP THE REPORT ALSO FULLY EMBRACES THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS FROM THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOT IT. AND WE HAVE ADOPTED SIGNIFICAN TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT REFORMS AT THE AUTHORITY. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY MADE PRIDE THE PROJECT MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE. BY POSTING CHANGE ORDERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ON THE WEBSITE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. IT WAS WILL GO TO THE SALLY OHS PRESENTATION SINCE THEY HAVE IT AND THEN WE'LL BRING TO OPEN IT UP -- FOR QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO INQUIRE IS YOUR OPERATOR THE ETL. EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR THEY HERE TODAY. I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE TODAY YES OKAY. TO BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE A I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THEM ON THE EARLY OPERATION TO PLEASE ELLIE A LET'S GET THE PRESENTATION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS HOW INCREASING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO AS WAS MENTIONED WE HAVE A HAND OUT THAT COMPANIES -- ARE REMARKS TODAY THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE AS WELL I'M TO HEAR THAT PROVIDE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE PROJECT IDENTIFY SOME KEY FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME. KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION I'M IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND GIVEN THE COMMITTEES -- EXTENSIVE FAMILIARITY WITH THIS PROJECT I'M GONNA SKIP OVER THE BACKGROUND I'M AND JUMP RIGHT TO PAGE SEVEN IF THAT -- THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M THAT WE IDENTIFIED THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHORITY -- AT AGE TWENTY SOME REYES AND BRIEFLY AS WELL ON THE FIRST IS IT REALLY CHANGES THE FOCUS OF THE PROJECT AND IT CHANGES THE FOCUS TYPE. OF TUMOR SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. YES -- THE PREVIOUS PLAN FOCUS MORE ON THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT WHICH WAS A SMALLER SEGMENT BETWEEN MADERA AND CHAPTER. THE PLAN ALSO PROPOSES TO BEGIN INTERIM FIVE SERVICES INTERIM HIGH SPEED SERVICES ON THAT MERCED. FIELD LINE OF THE PREVIOUS PLAN A PROPOSED INTERIM SERVICES POTENTIALLY STARTING I'M SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY AS WELL AS ON THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. I'M SECONDS ARE THE PLAN INCORPORATES FEEDBACK FROM THIS EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR WHICH WAS REFERENCE -- SO BASICALLY -- AS PART OF THE AUTHORITIES WORK I THEY CHARGE THAT REALLY TRAIN OPERATOR WITH LOOKING AT PROVIDING POTENTIAL INTERIM SERVICES ON EITHER THAT SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY LINE OR THIS MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD LINE AND BASED ON A VARIETY OF ASSUMPTIONS AND THOSE INCLUDED ON THE COMPLETION OF A RIGHT IF. CAPITAL PROJECTS AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING VERY INTEGRATED A SERVICE WITH EXISTING REAL PROVIDERS SUCH AS AMTRAK AND THE EAST CORRIDOR -- EVERY THE ACE SERVICE I GIVEN THOSE ASSUMPTIONS THEY FOUND THAT THE OPTIMAL SERVICE WAS TO DO MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. I NEXT THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT REFLECTS HIGHER COST ESTIMATES THAT WE SAW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I SPECIFICALLY THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ESTIMATES THE BASELINE COST OF CONSTRUCTING THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. I TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE VERSUS THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN ESTIMATE -- THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS THE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE CONTINGENCY. AND THE REASON WHY THEY ARE ADJUSTING WAS CONTINGENCY IS BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING A NEW APPROACH TO SETTING THE CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS SO BASICALLY THE CONTINGENCY IS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SET SUCH THAT. I'M IN THERE TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM -- BECAUSE THERE'S SOME UNKNOWNS IN IN CONSTRUCTING SUCH A PROJECT THE PREVIOUSLY THE WAY THAT THEY WERE ESTABLISHING THAT CONTINGENCY WAS -- TO WAS SUCH THAT. IF YOU ADDED THE CONTINGENCY AND YOU CREATED THIS BASE I BUDGET THE BASELINE. BUDGET THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY A 10% CHANCE THAT. FIND BUDGET. I'M AND SO IT 90% CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD GO OVER THAT BASELINE BUDGET US THEIR REVISING THAT APPROACH AND NOW THEY ARE. BASICALLY TAKING THE APPROACH FOR THIS SMALL THIS PORTION OF THE LINE A SETTING THAT BE SIGNED BUDGET SUCH THAT THERE'S A 70% CHANCE THAT WE'LL STAY WITHIN THAT BASELINE BUDGET RATHER THAN A 10% CHANCE. AND ONLY A 30% CHANCE WILL GO OVER THAT THAT'S BASED ON THEIR MODELING. I'M THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT COST INCREASE INCLUDING SCOPE CHANGES AND SOME COST INCREASES. I'M NEXT IT'S NOTABLE THAT THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE COST ESTIMATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT -- SO THERE'S SOME PORTIONS THAT% THEY HAVEN'T WE LOOKED AT SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN. AND I THEY ALSO IDENTIFY FUNDING SORT FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES THE COMMITTEES I THINK I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THESE INCLUDE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. ON THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATION OF THOSE FUNDS I'M THERE'S FEDERAL FIND THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS -- AND THERE'S ALSO PROP ONE A WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT. I BASED ON SOME ASSUMPTIONS ON CAP AND TRADE REVENUES -- THEY THEY ESTIMATE THAT THEY HAVE TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION TO TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION AVAILABLE -- THEY ASKED ME THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO DO THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD LINE AS WELL AS TO DO THE OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND PROJECTS PURCHASE TRAINS. ON THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. NINE NINE YOU'LL SEE A FIGURE THAT OUT LAYS OUT BOTH THE FINDING AS WELL AS THE COST FOR THE PROJECT I'M. SO NEXT THE STM AVAILABILITY ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PHASE ONE SO BASICALLY THEY THEY ASSUME THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY TO COMPLETE THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD MINE IN THOSE ASSOCIATED COMMITMENTS -- BUT THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO IDENTIFICATION OF FUNDING BEYOND THAT. I SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN AND WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY ISSUES FROM FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THAT THAT FOLLOW FROM THOSE THOSE -- KEY ASPECTS OF THE PLAN. THE FIRST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERIM SERVICE DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATORS MODELING REALLY ASSUME THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ASSUME THINGS ABOUT WHAT CAPITAL PROJECTS WOULD BE BUILT. ABOUT SERVE HOW THE OPERATIONS WOULD BE COORDINATED SO THAT THEY WOULD INCREASE RIDERSHIP -- SO IF THOSE DON'T COME TO PASS THEN WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE REVENUES AND AT THE RIDERSHIP UP MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE THE WAY THAT THEY EXPECT. THE SECOND MAJOR ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS A CITY WITH THIS PROJECT COULD BE HIGHER. SOME OF THAT IS JUST INTRINSIC TO DOING A MEGA PROJECT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE ON THERE ALSO SOME SPECIFIC UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THIS PROJECTS PARTLY -- SHOULD FUNDING THAT MATERIALIZE SCHEDULES GET PUSHED BACK WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WOULD HAVE SOME COST IMPLICATIONS. I'M AND ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED THEY TOOK THIS REVISED BUDGETING APPROACH WERE NOW THEY'RE TAKING A LESS AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO SETTING THAT BASELINE BUDGET -- WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THEY'RE ONLY DOING THAT FOR A SEGMENT O THE PROJECT THEY HAVEN'T -- APPLIED THAT. MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO THE ENTIRE PROJECT -- IF THEY DID WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE ENTIRE PROJECTS COST WOULD ALSO INCREASED AND SO WE PROBABLY BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING BEYOND THE SEVENTY NINE POINT ONE BILLION -- THAT. IS IDENTIFIED IN A PLAN. THIRD IT'S UNCLEAR IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD A PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE COST INCREASES COULD OCCUR ON THAT SEGMENT ALSO SOME OF THE REVENUES MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE SO POTENTIALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD RESEND THAT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION OR PORTION OF THAT THREE POINT. FIVE BILLION I'M AS THEY HAVE THREATENED TO DO I UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER THAT WILL OCCUR THERE'S ALSO SOME UNCERTAINTY -- NATURALLY WITH CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AND SO I'M SHOULD DOES NOT MATERIALIZE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED THAT WOULD BE ALSO A RISK THERE. ON IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ELEVEN WE CONTINUE WITH OUR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- THE NEXT ONE IS THAT THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BE BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SO AS I MENTIONED I'M REALLY THEY THEY FOCUS ON FINDING THAT THAT MERCED BAKERSFIELD LINE THEY THEY ESTIMATE THEY'LL DO THAT BUT IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR HOW WE WOULD FIND THE REST OF THE PROJECT. AND SO IT LIKELY THE GENERAL FUND WOULD HAVE TO OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR SOURCE WOULD HAVE TO COVER A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE COSTS. ON THE NEXT ISSUE I TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE OTHER OPTIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP BACK YOU GIVEN THEY WERE CHANGING DIRECTION GIVEN THAT THERE IS THIS FUNDING GAP. THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES ARE HOW IT WANTS TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT -- AND REALLY EVALUATE THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT FULLY EVALUATED IN THE IN THE PLAN HERE ON THERE REALLY A WHOLE RANGE OF OF POTENTIAL OPTIONS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED. WE COULD DO A SMALLER SEGMENT WE COULD DO A BIGGER SEGMENT -- WE COULD DO YOU -- CONVENTIONAL DIESEL SERVICE WE COULD DO ELECTRIFIED SERVICE THAT WAS LESS HIGH SPEED THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE ON THEIR PUBLIC TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THOSE APPROACHES. I'M SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AND AT CONSIDER. DISCUSSING WITH THE AUTHORITY THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE LAST ISSUE THAT FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION STARTS ON PAGE TWELVE I'M WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY CONSIDERATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO TAKE KEEP IN MIND AS IT EVALUATES. ANY AND ALL OF THOSE POTENTIAL OPTIONS. THE FIRST IS COST FOR THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AS I INDICATED -- IS ESTIMATED TO COST TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION AT THIS TIME EXTENSIONS TO MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD IF YOU COMBINE THOSE ARE ALMOST ADD ALMOST ANOTHER FOUR BILLION TO THE PROJECT. I'M SUIT THE LEGISLATURE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT COSTS OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. ON THE NEXT TO ISSUE AS TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS SO AGAIN IT'S LOOKING AT OKAY WELL FOR EXAMPLE NOT FOR THOSE EXTENSIONS. CLEARLY THE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS ARE THEY SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY ANOTHER FOR YOU KNOW FOR BILLION DOLLARS AS OF THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA WANT TO WRESTLE WITH. THE NEXT ISSUE IS THE EFFECT ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES SO BOTH THE CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS ON THERE SOME DISRUPTION TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN MANY CASES AS WELL AS SOME ECONOMIC. BENEFITS FROM THE ADDITIONAL JOBS SO ARE SOME TRADE OFFS THERE AND AND THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WILL PROBABLY HAVE DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT THINGS TO CONSIDER IN THAT RESPECT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THESE ARE -- ALSO IDENTIFIED IN YOUR AGENDA REALLY WELL -- BUT THERE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENT OPTIONS INCLUDE POTENTIAL AND DIFFERENCES AND THE AMOUNT OF RISK. CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES. THE MORE I AMBITIOUS THE PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF THOSE -- WRISTS OF COST INCREASES AND ALSO COORDINATION WITH REAL PROVIDERS AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE PROBABLY SOME RISKS THERE AND THEN COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A AND FEDERAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS ARE REALLY SOME KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY HAVE TO WAY. AS IT LOOKS SET ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED APPROACHING WAYS IT AGAINST OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. MEMBERS ARE. QUESTIONS I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE YEAR EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR SECTOR UNITS IF YOU CAN INVITE THEM UP HERE -- SPECIFICALLY SO MY QUESTION WAS -- STEP TWO QUESTIONS ONE WAS ON THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION OF THE PENINSULA WHEN THAT IS COMPLETED THE ELECTRIFICATION WHICH SHOULD BE BEFORE. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT Z. IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO RUN TESTS TRAINS ON THAT ON THAT SEGMENT OF TO DETERMINE. THE MAXIMUM SPEED THAT YOU COULD TRAVEL FROM. FRANCISCO TO YOUR DANCE STATION LET'S JUST PUT IT THERE. SO I SPECIFIC IN THE SECTION OF THE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FIRST SO IT'S A MY NAME IS HOLD HIM FOR YEARS. I AM THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF THE ALLEY TURN A PLATE. CHAU TALKING ABOUT THE SPEED IN THE SECTION ON SINCE WE HAVE OLD SCHOOL ALL THE THE CROSSINGS AND AND WE HAVE ALL THESE RESTRICTION IN THESE HIGHLY THEN SEE AT THESE HIGH ALLEY POPULATED THE SECTION. ON SO THE SPEED THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WILL NOT BE VERY DIFFERENT TO THE SPEED THAT CALTRAIN WILL ACHIEVE WHEN EVERYTHING IS ELECTRIFIED. SO WE ARE TALKING THAT THE IN THE SECTION WE COULD POTENTIALLY CHIEF. ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILES PER HOUR. RIGHT IN OF THESE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND OKAY ECUSA THAN THE COULD THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WOULD YOU RUN. HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS DURING THIS EARLY PERIOD IS A AGAIN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT GONNA STOP AT EVERY STOP SO THE SOME COORDINATION THAT WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR WERE EVERYTHING WOULD DROP DOWN AND IT WOULD GO FROM. HERE DOWN TO I GUESS THE AIRPORT RIGHT. THIS IS THE FIRST DURING THESE AREA IN THE STUDY WE ASSUME THAT THE HIGHEST PAID SERVICE WILL STOP. I WILL HAVE A SERVICE ONLY FOR STATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY. SO WE ASSUME THAT HE WILL STOP IN DELIVERY. IN ASH SAN JOSE. BREAK. KING IN THESE FOUR STATIONS. TO THE SEE WHAT WE ARE STREAMING TO STAND THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP. TEAMS WE ARE CHATTING THE CORRIDOR WITH DICK CALTRAIN -- TO TRAINS. SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHIEF -- TAKE HIRES PIZZA IN THE SECTION THAT THEY WILL ACHIEVE. AN EVEN THAT THE WHAT TRAINS WOULD BE FOSTER IN THIS CASE. I AM WHEN WE DID THE ANALYSIS ON TO FIND OUT IF IT MAKES SENSE TO DO ADDERLEY OPERATIONS IN THE PENINSULA. WEED OUT THE CONNECTION THROUGH THE PROJECT COLA TO THE PARTICULAR PLACE TO THAT TO THE HIGHEST BEAT. WE FOUND OUT THAT TERM OUR SERVICE CAN NO IT'S REALLY BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM DOES SERVICE. CALTRAIN WILL HAVE IN A IN. WE ASSUME THAT WE ASSUME THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN THE SERVICING TWENTY TWENTY A. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY. SO WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REALLY DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE SERVICE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WITHOUT HAVING THE CONNECTION TO THEM. TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO MORE OR LESS FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INFORMATION AROUND 12% OF THE PASSENGERS WHICH ARE WILLING TO TRAVEL IN THE PENINSULA. FROM ALL THE ALL THE PASSENGERS ONLY A 112% ARE WILLING TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THESE FOUR STATIONS. SO THE IMPACT THAT WE CAN CREATING THESE IN THE SECTION. IT'S NOT A IS NOT SO BIG THAT MAKE IT SAYS. I MEAN THAT WE CAN REALLY MAKE SENSE TO A TO A STAR SOMETHING BEFORE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE BODY TO BODY CONNECTION IS DONE. I CAN NOT MY NEXT QUESTION IS THAT. LET'S PRESUME THAT THE MADERA OF FRESNO SEGMENT GETS COMPLETED MINUTES THAT THE TRACK IS IT IS DONE IN THE CONSTRUCTION IS WORKING ON THE MADERA. TO TO MERCED IN AN HI KINGS TO LARRY'S BAKERSFIELD BUT THERE IS A SEGMENT DONE IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT YOU WOULD. BE TESTING TRAINS YOU JUST WAIT TILL THE WHOLE -- MERCED TO BREAK A SPELL THE STATE NO WE WE WE ARE COULD START THEIR SKINNER WAY BEFORE THE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE MERCER TRACK TO BAKERSFIELD. CONSTRUCTION IS DONE SO WE CAN START THE TESTING. WITHOUT WITH A SMALLER SECTION. ON THE TRAINS WOULD BE TEST OF COURSE AND THE THEIR TRACKING SYSTEMS WOULD BE THIRST BEFORE WE ENTER INTO OCTOBER. AT REVENUE SERVICE. EVEN IT'S ALSO A LINE TO THE NORMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GETTING THE CERTIFICATION FOR AND THREE THE PASSENGER SERVICE. YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE -- CERTAIN -- MY LISTENS. TO GET THE APPROVAL TO FRONT ON TO RUN THE TRAINS. OKAY. GREAT FROM THERE WAS A QUESTION. THAT WAS LAID OUT ON THE HEAVY RELIANCE AT FOR THIS IS FOR THE SECRETARY AS EVER RELIANCE ON CONSULTANTS AND THE THE SHIFT TO MORE -- EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN YOU ADDRESS -- THAT. SURE AND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THE STATE AUDITOR HAD INCLUDED IN THE NOVEMBER REPORT AS WELL. AND THERE'S A COUPLE ITEMS HERE ON THE AGENDA THAT THE TOUCH ON ON THAT ISSUE -- THERE'S AS SPRING FINANCE LETTER THAT REQUESTS TO ADD STATE STAFF AND DELETE CONSULTING STAFF THAT ARE REVIEWING SOME OF THE CONTRACT WORK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT'S A FURTHER IN YOUR AGENDA. I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET AN IDEA. A BIG PICTURE ON A TIMING IS THIS IS THIS. A MID YEAR IS THIS. TWENTY ONE DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR WORK ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT THESE REQUESTS AND WE HAVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AT LEAST IN THE SECURITY PEOPLE TO PROVE IT BUT BUT THE IF THERE IS A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING GOING ON NOT MAJOR RESTRICTION BUT RELIANCE ON CONSULTANTS VERSUS RELIANCE ON AN INTERNAL. EASE IF IF THE HIGH SPEED ROSE ALREADY STARTED SOME OF THAT THE WORK OF AT THE ADVERTISING JOB DESCRIPTION SO IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE THAT THE FUNDING. I WILL BE ABLE TO STE START THOSE AT POSITIONS -- WILL HELP HOPING IN JULY WHO I GET SOME PEOPLE ON BOARD FOR THAT TRYING CHáVEZ. AND THEN THE BROADER EFFORTS AT THE CEO'S MANSION LOOKING AT REALLY OFFICE BY OFFICE DOING AN EVALUATION TO MAKE SURE THAT. OF A FORM FITS THE FUNCTION AND SEEING IF THERE'S OTHER AREAS AS WELL WHERE IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE STATE STAFF AUGMENTED AND REDUCE THE CONSULTING RESOURCES AND THAT WOULD BE. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE -- WOULD BE BRING MORE TO YOU PROBABLY NEXT BUDGET CYCLE -- IT NEXT YEAR. CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TO GO BACK TO THE ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE. AND THEN. ANY OF YOU THE OPTION OF EXTENSION OF THAT CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY [inaudible] SOUNDS LIKE. HIGH SPEED RAIL [inaudible] IS GILROY. SAN JOSE IT BYPASSES MORGAN HILL. CALTRAIN SERVICE MORGAN HILL -- HAD IS THAT POSSIBLE ELECTRIFICATION EXTENSION TO GILROY FIT INTO OPTIONS. YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF PROVIDING MORE IMMEDIATE. TRAFFIC RELIEF COMMUTER SERVICE. WITH THE CALTRAIN ROUTE VERSUS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL [inaudible] SERVICE. YEAH LET ME ADDRESS THAT AT THE F. AT BUSINESS PLAN TALKED ABOUT LOOKING MORE THOSE AT THOSE SEGMENTS ON ON THE EITHER SIDE OF VALLEY TO VALLEY INCLUDING THE GALLERY TO SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT WAS. PART OF THE E. T. O. ANALYSIS -- AS WAS AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE U. TEO THERE'S SOME WE THINK THAT MORE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN THE PRIORITIZATION TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT THAT YOUR A SEGMENT -- HAS BENEFITS AS WELL SO WE'RE CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FREIGHT OPERATOR ON GETTING MORE ACCESS TO THAT LINE -- AND THAT WOULD BENEFIT BOTH CALTRAIN AND ULTIMATELY HIGH SPEED RAIL SO THE THE EFFORTS CONTINUE TO TO LOOK AT HOW TO DO THAT BUT I AS FAR AS THE THE PRIORITIZATION WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT PROJECT UPDATE REPORTS SUGGEST THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THE HIGHER PRIORITY. AND IS FUND OF ALL WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. TO TWENTY THIRTY THANK YOU SO HOW WOULD YOU. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE STATUS OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH? THE REAL PROVIDER FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY. WELL I HAVE WE HAVE HAD I I THINK WE WERE HAVING IMPROVED A DISCUSSION SAID THERE WAS A PERIOD OF YEARS AGO WHERE DIFFERENT OPPOSITE NO WAY WE DON'T EVEN WANT TO CONSIDER THIS. OUR IN DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT TYPE OF INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE THAT A CONSIDERATION FOR THEM AND SO. THAT. THOSE ARE AVERAGE DESCRIBED AS POSITIVE -- WE DO HAVE A SOME WAYS TO GO BUT AGAIN -- THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS NOW AND WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN. JUST AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SOUTH AND CLEAR COUNTY. THERE'S HI PUBLIC INTEREST RATE IN. IN A MORE IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO RESIDENTS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY SO I JUST. HOPE YOU'LL KEEP US POSTED OF PROGRESS ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WANTING TO SELL A HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT AT ALL THE ELECTRIFICATION FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY. WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IN DETAIL -- CERTAINLY AS WAS NOTED THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY A FOCUS THAT WE THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WOULD BE. APPROPRIATE AS AN OPTION I MEAN CLEARLY YOU COULD -- YOU COULD CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANTED. TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE PROJECT -- WHETHER YOU WANTED TO INCLUDE FOR THEIR WORK NORTH ON IN THE BAY AREA -- OR IF YOU SPEND LESS MONEY ON THIS PROJECT THAT WOULD FREE UP MONEY YOU KNOW TO DO OTHER KINDS OF REGIONAL PROJECTS SO -- WE HAVEN'T DONE A AND IN AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS AT THIS TIME BUT WE THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF KIND OF CHOICE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPACING. IN IT AGAIN BACK TO THE ELECTRIFICATION. AND FRANCISCO TO SANTA IS A THAT WAS A FEATURE OF THE BALLOT PROPOSITION THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS SUPPORTED NIGHT I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN NECESSARILY. GOOD PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE IMMEDIATE BENEFITS BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY INTO CONSUMER -- COMMUTER. RAIL SERVICE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOND -- I THINK. PEOPLE SHOULD BE REMINDED OF THAT AT EVERY POSSIBLE TURN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NOTE THAT. DE. EAST BAY THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND THE RAILROADS ARE IN. DISCUSSIONS REGARDING ACCESS TO FROM THE PORT THROUGH THE I GUESS THE WHERE THE ACE TRAVELS AND THEN GOING DOWN TO SAN JOSE. ACROSS THERE SO AT LEAST THE RAILROAD FOLKS ARE AT THE TABLE WHICH CANNOT ALWAYS BE SAID THAT BOX WAS GOING ON TO BE INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT SAID THAT CORRIDOR CONTINUES DOWN TO GILROY. ON THAT THAT NILES ROUTER WHICH WHICHEVER THE LINE. THE LINE IS SO -- AS LONG AS YOU'RE AT THE TABLE THAT'S THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE. MAKES SENSE CENTER STERN FAMOUS CHAIR -- THANK YOU SECRETARY FOR COMING IN THIS IS YOUR I GUESS YOUR LAST BUDGET SERVICE IN YOUR WITH THIS CURRENT HAD ON SO -- WHILE STILL GOT YOU. BEFORE US -- ANY LA -- I WANTED TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED AROUND. THE LACK OF A FUNDING PLAN. ON ANYTHING BEYOND MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD HERE AND WHAT YOU SORT OF SEE IS THE FUTURE -- NO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I KNOW I'M ON A ON A COMMITTEE WITH MOSTLY MY FRIENDS FROM THE NORTH -- BUT THE BULK OF THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THIS STATE IN THE BOOK OF THE TRAFFIC. WE KNOW WHERE IT IS AND TERMS OF DISPLACING VEHICLE TRIPS IN THIS STATE THE CORRIDORS THAT ARE ANTICIPATED FOR THAT SOUTHERN. BOOK AND HAVE HUGE VMT DISPLACEMENT VALUE SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. STRATEGICALLY HOW DID YOU GUYS LAND ON THIS SEGMENT. WAS IT IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. METRIC THAT STARTED DROVE IT WAS THERE WAS THERE A METRIC THE TROUBLE AT ALL WANT TO GET YOUR FIRST THOUGHTS ON THAT. BUT IN IN TERMS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS REVISED TODAY I THINK THE STATE'S ALWAYS APPROACH THESE NOT AS AN EITHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL OR COMMUTER RAIL AND INTERCITY RAIL INVESTMENTS BUT BOTH. AND OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THAT THE CAP AND TRADE IN THE SP. ONE AND HIGH SPEED RAIL BOOKENDS AND MONEY ANOTHER FINDING THERE'S ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAIL INVESTMENT SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE SO HAPPY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS DOWN THERE AS WELL AS FAR AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ANALYSIS -- THE BOARDED CHOSEN THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AS THE BEST APPROACH TO GETTING HIGH SPEED RAIL UP AND RUNNING. AND THEN THIS ANALYSIS THAT THE GAO DID WAS FOCUSED WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK OF LOOKING AT THOSE TWO ENDS OF VALLEY TO VALLEY AND DETERMINING WHERE'S IN A ROOM SERVICE. WE'RE WITH THAT AT BEST BENEFIT TO STATE. SO GETTING UP AND RUNNING THAT WAS THE GOAL TO GET LIKE WHAT'S THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET YOU SET UP AND RUNNING. YES HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S WHERE THE TRAINS CAN GO THE THE FASTEST -- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THAT THE SPEED THAT'S DEMANDED WITH PROP ONE A WERE YOU ACHIEVE THOSE HIGHER SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THAT THE FLAT AREAS WITH A LOT OF RURAL AREAS THAT THE TRAINS GOING THROUGH BUT NOT NECESSARILY A V. M. T. DRIVEN ANALYSIS OR AT A DAILY TRIPS. DISPLACEMENT OR GREENHOUSE GAS METRIC FOR ABOUT. THE SPEED AT WHICH YOU CAN GET TO HIGH SPEED. WELL I GUESS MULTIPLE CONSIDERATIONS NOT JUST ONE BUT CERTAINLY AT LOOKING AT THE AT THE AT AN INSULAR VERSES THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE CHEETOS ANALYSIS WOULD COVER SOME OF THOSE ITEMS YOU MENTION YOU KNOWS RIDERSHIP WHAT'S THE RIDERSHIP GAIN. YOU KNOW THAT GETS TO YOUR V. M. T. ISSUE A BED YOU KNOW HOW MANY NEW WRITERS ARE YOU BRINGING N TO RAIL. HAS ALSO THE EMPHASIS ON  AS A SEGMENT THAT WOULD TEST THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS AT THEIR AT THEIR MAXIMUM SPEED SO. MULTIPLE CONSIDERATIONS AGAIN THAT'S THE FOCUS -- CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN AS LOOKING AT THE VALLEY TO VALLEY A SEGMENT. AND AND DO YOU HAVE A SENSE MEAN PAINT PAINT US IT IS MUCH OF PICTURES YOU CAN HAR GOING FORWARD -- I I'M I'M JUST I'M TROUBLED BY THE LACK OF CERTAINTY RIGHT NOW AND I I I I I KNOW THERE'S A LOT GOING ON SO I I'M. I JUST WANT. TO GET GET THIS AIRED OUT BUT I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S STILL A FORM SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT PENDING DOWN SOUTH THAT. IN THE THERE'S INTENSE BUT NOT EXECUTION YET UPDATE ON THAT -- I THINK THAT'S IN THE IN IN THE METROLINK METRO AREA ON THE BOOKENDS YEAH THEIRINTENDED. SEE THAT THROUGH EVEN IF IT'S NOT ARTICULATED IN THIS BUDGET. LAID OUT HERE -- ABSOLUTELY I BELIEVE THE TIME THAT THE A LOS ANGELES UNION STATION PROJECT ROUNTREE TRACKS AND ABSOLUTELY -- THAT IS STILL -- PART OF THIS AB FAB PLAN IS. TO AB IT HERE TO THOSE COMMITMENTS TO DO THE BOOK AND PROJECTS CALTRAIN WHICH IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION ALREADY. BUT ALSO -- THE FUNDING AGREEMENT ADD TO ADD A START FLOWING THE PROP ONE A BOND FUNDS TO LA UNION STATION WHEN THAT PROJECT GOES TO CONSTRUCTION AS WELL HI MINE SENSE ON THAT BUT I BELIEVE AS YOU KNOW AS EARLY AS SAID THIS. LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR THOSE -- THOSE FUNDING AGREEMENTS NO THIS FUNDING AGREEMENTS ARE PART OF THE PROVISIONS OF PROP ONE A THAT -- WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT LOOK AT THE FUNDING AGREEMENT AND COME FORWARD WITH WITH THOSE PLANS SO THOSE ARE. A ANTICIPATED FOR LATER THIS CALENDAR YEAR IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE THICK THERE'S A STUDY THAT STILL HAS TO BE DONE -- CONSULTANT ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU ARE GOING TO SO THE AXIS PROGRESS FONG CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. ACCESS THE PROBLEM A FUNDS WE HAVE TO DO -- FUNDING FEE PLAN IN THE FUNDING THE PLANS THAT ACTUALLY RUNS THROUGH YOUR OFFICE. A PART OF THE FUN THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE FUNDING THE PLAN IS WE HAVE TO GET AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS ON WHETHER THIS PLAN ACTUALLY MAKES OUT. AND THAT'S WHAT -- SECONDARY ADDIS'S REFERRING. TO SO YOU THERE'S STILL A DISCRETIONARY DECISION AS TO WHETHER THAT MAKES SENSE EXACTLY WE HAVE A THAT HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED BY. THE SECRETARY OR BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WHETHER IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE WELL THROUGH ON THOSE I THINK I COULD SAY THAT WE WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE WHY WE HAVE TO DO IS FILL THE PROP ONE A STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE INCLUDED -- THIS REPORT WITHOUT DEPENDENT ANALYSIS THAT IS SHARED WITH THAT. THE LEGISLATURE THIRD PARTY VALIDATION OF OUR OKAY UNDERSTOOD AND ELLIE -- JUST I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU POINTED OUT THAT. THE MONIES ARE TO GOES UP TO A POINT AND THEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE -- NEW BUT JUST. THE ELABORATE ON THAT. SURE SO THIS PLAN IDENTIFIES FUNDING FOR THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AND THE AUTHORITY IS INDICATED THIS IS A BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH AND THAT YOU KNOW ALTERNATELY I THINK THE GOAL IS TO DO MORE THAN THAT. AT THIS TIME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY TIGHT JUST EVEN DO THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- AND THERE'S NO FUNDING THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BEYOND THAT AT THIS POINT SO THAT ASSUMES FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE FUNDING THAT YOU KNOW CAP AND TRADE FUNDING -- TO TWENTY THIRTY SO YOU KNOW THAT'S SORT OF WHAT'S IN CURRENT STATUTE IT ASSUMES THAT WE KEEP THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE'VE THAT'S AT RISK -- ADDED ASSUMES ALL OF THE PROP ONE EIGHTY FIVE SO SHOULD THE THE STATE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A SEGMENT BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- I SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED AND THOSE COULD BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL WILL CHANGE ITS TUNE ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME THAT'S ON CLEAR -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU KNOW OF OTHER ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AND BY THE ADMINISTRATION BUT AT THIS TIME THERE'S THERE'S NO OR YOU KNOW MAYBE PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING WILL COME AND BUT AT THIS. POINT WE WE HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT. IS THAT INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO SORT OF LEAVE YOURSELF FLEXIBILITY YOU OR OR IS IT THAT THE MONEY'S JUST NOT THURMOND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THIS SORT OF UNCERTAINTY GOING FOR IT I MEAN I WELL HOW DO I GOING DOWN THE LOS ANGELES OR DOWN TO SAN DIEGO OR DOWN TO WHERE MOST THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE LIVE WHO ARE STUCK IN TRAFFIC ALL DAY HOW DO WE TELL THEM THAT THE HIGH SPEED. RAIL IS COMING AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP THEM I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL THEM THAT IF THERE'S NO MONEY THERE -- WHEN IN? THE ON OF I KNOW USING ONE ED RIGHT BUT WHATEVER WE'RE NOT HEARING WE'RE NOT HEARING G. G. R. AFTER NOT HEARING SORT OF ANOTHER PLANNED SO HELP ME OUT HERE -- HAVE SILLY WELL IN A WILL PART OF THIS PLAN IS IN SOME RESPECTS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THEM PRIOR PLANTS IN A COUPLE WAYS. SO AT IN THE PRIOR PLAN WE TALKED ABOUT EXTENDING CAP AND TRADE TO TWENTY FIFTY FROM TWENTY THIRTY SO WE DIDN'T COUNT THAT REVENUE IN THIS CASE WE LOOKED AT THE AUTHORITY WE HAVE. TO TWENTY THIRTY ON THE COST SIDE -- WE INCREASE THE CONTINGENCY BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS SO THIS IS A VERY FOCUSED AND LOOKING AT THE MONEY WE HAVE TODAY. AND I THINK THAT PROJECTS AT A STAGE WHERE DELIVERY IS CRITICAL WE NEED TO DELIVER THE CONSTRUCTION WE'RE DOING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ULTIMATELY DELIVER HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS THAT ARE RUNNING ON THE SEGMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. SO THERE IS A BIT OF AN INCREASE FOCUSED ON ON THOSE THINGS -- THE GOVERNOR SAID HE STILL HAS THAT VISION OF THAT THE FULL SYSTEM. IT'S DIFFICULT -- TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT A FEDERAL PARTNER THAT'S INTERESTED IN CONTINUING THE FUNDING I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE A AB NOT IMMEDIATELY. BUT THERE'S MANY STATES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND I THINK WITH THE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY EDGED CHAIN IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I THINK HIGH SPEED RAIL MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE. AND YOU KNOW -- COMMUTER RAIL ANOTHER RAIL SYSTEMS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE THAN EVER SO YOU KNOW I I'M LONG TERM OPTIMISTIC THAT TO YOU KNOW WE WE KEEP BUILDING -- BUT HAVING A AGAIN DEVELOPING THAT INCREASED CREDIBILITY FROM THE DELIVERY I THINK IT'S KEY NOW AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE FOCUSED ON THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IN THIS QUESTION AT ENVIRONMENTAL ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS ARE ANALYSES NEEDED ON THE BOOK AND SIDE OF THINGS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON ON THAT ISSUE DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S I MEAN HOW HOW MANY STEPS AWAY ARE WE FROM ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO SEVEN CALIFORNIA LIKE THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN AS OPPOSED TO LIKE. WE GOTTA WAIT FOR A NEW ADMINISTRATION OR CHANGE THE DATA TO THEIR OR ADDITIONAL FUNDING MATERIALIZING LIKE. OKAY BEYOND THE SECURING THE FUNDING IS THERE ALSO AS RIGOROUS Là SERVE MULTIPLE HOOPS WE'VE GOT TO JUMP THROUGH AND SEE CA OUR OTHER FRIENDS RIGHT NOW. WELL AS FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNION STATION PROJECT TO THAT INITIAL SCOPE THROUGH INITIAL CONSTRUCTION HAS HAS RECEIVED FULL FUNDING OF BOTH HROUGH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOOK IN FUNDING BUT ALSO THROUGH ONE OF THESE THAT TRANSIT INTERCITY. RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM THE SP ONE CAP AND TRADE GRANTS. BUT IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STAGE RIGHT NOW -- LA UNION STATION. AT OR AT LA METRO IS IS IS OF THE YES THE SPONSOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS. AND THEY HAVE -- GOING FORWARD WITH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS AT WITH THIS SEQUEL FIRST STRATEGY -- SO THEY'RE PUT OUT THE SECRET DOCUMENTS ADVANCING KNOWS -- THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO ASK IF ANY BUT YEAH SO. SOME WAY TO YEAH I STREAMLINED BASED ON SEEK WOULD IN THEORY IF YOU COULD TEAR OFF THAT AND IT IS THAT WHAT IT DID WHAT'S UP THE MOST IS TO DO THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND AND LACK OF ENGAGEMENT. BUT OF BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- BISCUITS CAUSING A RISK HERE I IN INCLUDING THE LA UNION STATION PROJECT THAT THEY'RE PURSUING THE SEQUEL FIRST STRATEGY TO ADVANCE THAT SIDE OF IT. I LONGER TERM -- WE HAVE -- AT THAT I THINK MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WAS SUBMITTED THE DOCK IN THE INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION. REQUESTING NEPA ASSIGNMENT -- FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS STREAMLINING MAJOR IT'S SOMETHING THAT CALTRANS ENJOYS FOR HIGHWAY AND ROAD PROJECTS SINCE I THINK ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND SIX AND IT'S A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF TIME WHICH THEN RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF MONEY. AND SO WITH FAT -- WE'VE APPLIED FOR THAT UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT -- AUGUST OF LAST YEAR -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- REALLY DISCONTINUED DURING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL NEED FOR WORK ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AND HAS NOT GRANTED THE NEED BY SIMON EITHER SO WE'RE WE'RE STUCK RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S WHY THE OBJECT UP A REPORT ED DID. DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF A PRINT TO TALKING ABOUT FEDERAL RISK. SO I WOULD JUST WRAP UP AND THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND FOR YOUR SMITH SECRETARY -- THE MORE WE CAN DO I GET THE FEDERAL RISKS THE MORE WE CAN DO TO SHOW SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. FOR ALL THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT. AT LEAST THAT THERE'S AN INTENT AND I APPRECIATE WORKING ON THE RUN THROUGH THEIR OTHER ISSUES TO IN THE AREA ON THE BOOKENDS RIGHT NOT JUST RUN THROUGH THERE'S ALL THE UPGRADES THROUGH THAT -- YOU KNOW VARIOUS LINES GOING TO THE REGION -- I STILL BELIEVE IN GETTING THE SAN DIEGO. AND I I TRULY THINK I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOUR FIVE FREEWAY THAT IS THE MOST TRAFFIC FREEWAY ON THE PLANET CUMULATIVELY -- SO HELP US YOU KNOW ANYTHING I CAN DO TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS TO HELP WAS ARTICULATE THAT VISION DOWN SOUTH BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS. I JUST -- LOSE THE CONSTITUENCY DOWN THERE I GET PROJECT EXECUTION AND DELIVERY BUT SOMEONE AT LEAST HAVE A CONTINGENT PLAN OR SORT OF ARTICULATING WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE IF SAY X. DOLLARS MATERIALIZE OR EFFECTS FEDERAL APPROVALS FOR GRANTED I THINK OF BE VERY HELPFUL SO. JUST FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU AND THANK CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS SECTOR GOOD TO SEE YOU THINK IS A MUCH LA -- AS WELL AND BE QUICK IN REGARDS TO I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THE SAN JOAQUIN LINE. YOU'RE STILL NEEDING TO BE CONVERSATIONS TO BE A TO FLUSH OUT. LEASING OF THAT LINE RIGHT I AND THEN ALSO -- WHAT HAPPENS? TO OUR SENSES THAT WE PUT INTO THAT LINE LONGER TERM SO HE JUST BRINGS UP TO DATE ONE MORE TIME ON THE SAN JOAQUIN. ADELINE COME IN IN THE BAY. SURE BUT THE I THINK IT IS A LEADING TO THAT -- THE PROPOSAL TO WORK WITH ALL THESE PARTNERS SAID TO HIGH SPEED RAIL CANNOT. RUN A SERVICE THAT REQUIRES AN OPERATING SUBSIDY BUT THE EXISTING COMMUTER LINES EXISTING INTER CITY RAIL LINE'S TODAY. I RECEIVE OPERATING SUPPORT AND SO WHAT THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR LOOKED AT WAS HOW THAT WOULD CHANGE WITH AND WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO AG LOOKING AT BOTH A SAN JOAQUIN'S AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE AS WELL AS THE EXISTING CONNECTING BUS SERVICE. THE TEARS ESTIMATED THAT THE OPERATING SUBSIDY WOULD ACTUALLY FALL WITH THE ADVENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SEWED FALL FROM ABOUT EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WITHOUT TO ABOUTSIXTY THREE MILLION A YEAR WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL BEING ADDED TO THAT SECTION. AND THAT'S BECAUSE RIDERSHIP GROWS SUBSTANTIALLY AND SO WITH THAT YOU HAVE A GREATER FAREBOX RECOVERY. AND THAT'S COVERING A GREATER PROPORTION OF THE COST. INDEED. GO ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SAID THE NINE HIGH SPEED RAIL SIDE I'LL. SAY. YOU THERE ARE STILL DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING ABOUT THAT THAT LONGER TERM LEASE CORRECT. HE SAID LONGER TERM NEEDS LEASE LISA I'M SORRY YEAH. AB AT CORRECT YES SO -- YOU THERE'S THERE'S ORE WORK TO DO WITH THE PARTNERS BUT SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE THE CALTRAIN STATEMENT. IN THAT -- PROP ONE A ENVISIONS OTHER A PASSENGER RAIL PROVIDERS AT HAVING ACCESS AND USE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WE WOULD. CONTINUE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO SAN JOAQUIN CHASE ON HOW THEY THEY COULD ACCESS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON MY ADMINISTRATIVE CAP WITHOUT PROP ONE A WE KNOW THAT THE YOUR CALL AT SOMETIME GOING TO HAVE TO BE COMING BACK TO US. ON THE INCREASE OF THE CAP. IF WE GO AHEAD AND WE MOVE CONSULTANTS TO REGULAR STAFF YOU HAVE. AT THE END THAT TIMING. YES SIR -- AT OUR CURRENT ADMIN BUDGET OF FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- E WILL ANTICIPATE RUNNING OUT AT OUR CURRENT RATE -- FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DO HAVE TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN AND NOW WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE OUR TWO AND A HALF PERCENT CAP. THE 5%. IF THAT'S THE CASE WE DO GET THE MILLION DOLLAR ADMIN BUDGET -- THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET US OUT TO FISCAL YEAR [inaudible] TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND IN. LET'S JUST PLAY A GAME ARE THE CHAIR HERE HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF INCREASING THE ALLOWANCES ON THE CAP AND TRADE. I'M CONTINUE TO BE TENACIOUS OF NICHOLS IS LISTENING ON THIS SO LET'S JUST WALK ME THROUGH THIS LET'S JUST SAY THAT I'M. MORE WE'RE THE S. LEGISLATURE'S SUCCESSFUL THAT THE CAP ENTRY REVENUES GO FROM THREE BILLION. SIX BILLION THEN TO NINE BILLION SO THAT THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAILS AUTHORITY GOES TO ANOTHER. BILLION AND A HALF A YEAR. OKAY LET'S JUST LET'S JUST SAY THAT AND SO IF WE PROJECT THAT OUT FOR TEN YEARS THAT'S FIFTEEN BILLION. WORTH SIXTY BILLION SHORT. THE QUESTION WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE SHORTFALL IS STILL THERE EVEN IF EVEN IN. THE CHAIRS MOST YOU KNOW AGGRESSIVE. A SCENARIO ONE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH SHOULD BE A STEADY. FLOW OF MONEY HOW DO WE CLOSE THE OTHER FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CASH. VIOLENCE THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION AND IN THE SECOND QUESTION WHICH I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WHO I CAN ALWAYS SAID SAID WHAT'S YOUR THINKING AND THAT THE NEW -- PLAN WE'RE WITH THAT. EXTRA MONEY GO WITH THAT BE TO THE BOOK IN ST LOS ANGELES THE GILROY A SEGMENT. OR TWO PALMDALE HEIGHT ON THE OF WHAT WE DO IF YOU IF YOU ONLY GOT A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU NEEDED WHAT WOULD BE. FROM YOUR ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY SEE ME TO LET YOU LOOK AT LOTS OF SCENARIO SO THERE WAS THAT. THE THE CITY ARE YOU CHOSE WAS NUMBER ONE SO BUT NUMBER. TWO ONE THREE HOW WOULD THAT WORK AND WELL AS A GAMER PLANS YEAH. FIRST OF ALL I I WOULD TAKE THAT INCREASING CAP AND TRADE AND COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT SO LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE TODAY SO WE HAVE TWO SCENARIOS ON OUR SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN EIGHTEEN AND AND THE CURRENT PROJECT OF THE REPORT. WEST MADE AT THE LOW END IF WE WERE TO GET FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN CAP AND TRADE THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTY WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT -- IF THAT CAP AND TRADE COMES IN AT SEVEN FIFTY AND THAT'S OUR HIGHER SCENARIO. WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN TO SEE HOW THIS ACCUMULATES. BUT THE CHALLENGE AGAIN WOULD COME TRADE IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COMES IN AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO ALSO LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF STABILITY IN THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE FLUCTUATION OF CAP AND TRADE A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR A PROJECT THIS LARGE. WHEN YOU'RE WE MIGHT GET A BIG BOX OF IT TWICE AS MUCH AS WE PLANNED THE OTHER YOU KNOW ANOTHER YEAR COULD COME IN QUITE A BIT LESS? SO OBVIOUSLY A HIGHER CAP WOULD BE WONDERFUL FOR THE PROJECT IT WOULD CLOSE THE GAP. I'LL BUT I ALSO WOULD COURAGE LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF STABILITY AND THE FLUCTUATION OF WHAT WE GET EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT THAT'S REALLY THE KEY THE TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THIS PROJECT IS HOW MUCH. ACTUAL CASH WE'RE GONNA GET PER YEAR. ABOUT GETTING INTO. A GREAT DISCUSSION PART OF THAT WAS THE EXTENSION TO TWENTY THIRTY AND THE CUSHION OF TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT THE UNCERTAINTY WAS. WAS RELEASED I GUESS THIS FOLLOWING HIS VICTORY IN THIS IS THAT IS THAT WHAT WOULD WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT IF WE IF WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS -- DELIVERY OFFICE OF OF OPERATING SEGMENT WHAT WOULD BE NEXT WERE IN THE LOGICAL SEQUENCE AND WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR WAYS. TALK TO THESE PEOPLE ON LOS ANGELES ABOUT WHEN IT'S COMING. BUT CERTAINLY ENTION TOO THAT -- THE CAP AND TRADE RISING IS SAID MAYBE A RISING THAT WATER LINE THEIR LIVES OTHER VOTES TO INCLUDING HE HAD. TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM THAT RECEIVES MONEY THERE SO. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS IT I THINK FUNDED THE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE METROLINK ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE LAST ROUND SO THAT THAT HELPS ON MULTIPLE -- SCORES -- BUT YEAH CORDY AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN THE VALLEY TO VALLEY. AND INDICATED -- THEY GET WORRIED TO SANTA TO S. SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN. BRIDGING THAT GAP THAT. TO GILROY -- TO THE MADERA GAP AS THE WHAT'S CURRENTLY -- AT THAT TIME WAS LISTED AS THE THE MAJOR FINDING PEACE SO HE WANTED TO FOCUS ON THAT. AGAIN I I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW STATEWIDE -- THE RAIL MODERNIZATION APPROACH AND THE THE INCLUDING ON OUR COMMUNITY COMMUTER IN INNER CITY IS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO BECAUSE FOR THE SYSTEMS TO TO WORK AND ACHIEVE THE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS THE VM TO PRODUCTION YOU NEED A NETWORK OF RAIL. THAT CONNECTS TO EACH OTHER AND AND HIGH SPEED ROSE THAT BACKBONE. BUT YOU NEED THOSE CONNECTING PIECES TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL. JUST AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM NO ACTION IS REQUIRED TO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS YOUR I. T. SECURITY REQUEST OF FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN -- THE CURRENT -- FISCAL BUDGET YEAR.

CERTAIN WORKLOAD ACTIVITIES FROM THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TO STATE STAFF. WELL THE AUTHORITY IS CONDUCTING A BROADER REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. THIS INITIAL REQUEST WILL REDUCE OVERALL PROGRAM COSTS BY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY BY REDUCING TH NUMBER OF CONSULTANT POSITION. SUPPORTED ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA OF CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT. AND THE FINANCIAL OFFICE REPLACE THOSE CONSULTANTS WITH STATE STAFF. THIS REPLACE THIS REQUEST INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF THIRTY FIVE STATE POSITIONS. AND FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP ONE A FUNDING. OFFSET BY THE REDUCTION OF THIRTY FIVE CONSULTANT HAVE TV'S.

YOU SEEN OUR STAFF REPORT WHAT IS THE CURRENT VACANCY RATE THAT YOU HAVE AND HOW. WHAT'S RECALL MY HAND HERE AND HOW WE'RE GOING. TO FILL THE HAVE ABOUT FORTY TWO VACANCIES IT COMES OUT TO ABOUT OUR VACANCY RATE TODAY IN -- I'LL YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD WE'VE KIND OF HOVERED AROUND THE 20% VACANCIES. ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS A FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE INCREASED BY YOU HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY NEW POSITIONS OVER THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD -- THERE ARE SOME POSITIONS THAT I'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING TO RECRUIT -- BUT THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE FOR THE THIRTY FIVE ARE I WOULD CLASSIFY AS MORE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. THAT ARE MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND IN STATE SERVIE. OR THE ADMIN FOLKS. THANK YOU HELLO. WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SHIFT SOME AS WORKLOAD CONSISTING OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT FROM CONSULTANTS TO STATE STAFF JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT -- THERE IS AN AUGMENTATION BEING MADE TO THE BUDGET THERE ISN'T A COMMENSURATE SORT OF BUDGET REDUCTION ON THEIR EXPECTING THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BASICALLY HAVE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO PAY THIS AYE REAL DELIVERY PARTNER. FOR AND SO THAT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE HOWEVER WE DO YOU -- THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO WANTTO HAVE KIND OF AB CONTINUED OVERSIGHT OVER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY ARE REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON THAT CONTRACTOR -- AND AND ACTUALLY KEEPING THOSE GOALS THAT'S A GOOD GUESS -- I THIS IS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING IS THE LAST MATTER WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WASHINGTON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE BIG WITH THEIR ANDROID ASSOCIATES FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS. IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS REQUEST HOWEVER WE DON'T THINK IT GOES QUITE FAR ENOUGH -- BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR AND A RECENT -- INVESTIGATION BY THE LA TIMES FOUND THAT -- HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN. PRETTY MUCH OVER RUN BY PRIVATE SECTOR ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS THOSE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR TO HIRE ADDITIONAL CONSULTANTS TO OVERSEE CONSULTANTS TO INSPECT OTHER CONSULTANTS EXCEPT DURING JUNIOR SHOULD BE BROUGHT ON BOARD. TO DO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION -- JUST LIKE THIS WOULD SAVE MONEY. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN ON THE ENGINEERING IT'S AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THESE PRIVATE SECTOR ENGINEERS WE THINK THAT THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE -- COMMENDED HAVE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC ENGINEERS AT THE AUTHORITY THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. LIMóN THING ABOUT HAVE THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF ENGINEERING COMPANIES APOLOGIZE FOR THE VOICE YOU CAN THANK MY SON FOR THAT -- I JUST WANTED TO BOUNCE OFF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CANNOT BE BOILED DOWN TO ONE ISSUE OF CONSULTANTS VERSUS STATE STAFF. NOBODY DISCOUNT THE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE. THE PRIVATE CONSULTANTS BRING TO THE TABLE AND AGAIN. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS FACING A PROBLEM WITH RETENTION AND MEN OF A QUALIFIED STAFF WHICH ACTUALLY IS A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF GRADUATE STEM EDUCATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY LET'S CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING I'M SEEING ANOTHER COMMENTS WILL GET A HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN. AND THANK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOR THEIR PRESENTATION.

FOUR THIS IS PROJECT DELIVERY WORKLOAD [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR SENATORS ARE MY NAME IS JIM DAVIS I AM THE SPECIAL ADVISER TO DIRECTOR BERMAN IT CALTRANS. WITH ME IS CAR PAULSON OR DIVISION CHIEF OF BUDGETS. CALTRANS REQUEST AN INCREASE OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION AND FORTY EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS FOR PROJECT DELIVERY WORKLOAD. SCHOOL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES INCREASING WORKLOAD TO DELIVER PROJECTS TO ME SENATE BILL ONE OR SP ONE REQUIREMENTS. TOTAL WORKLOAD RESOURCES REQUESTED AT THE TRADITIONAL 90% STATE STAFF 10% CONSULTANT RATIO. AFTER A DECADE OF DECLINING WORKLOAD FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MORE. THE FIRST TIME MAJOR INCREASE IN THE CAPITAL IS ABOARD. COS PROGRAM DUE TO SB. ONE CALTRANS DEVELOPED AND EXECUTED AN AGGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT PROGRAM TO MEET INCREASED STAFFING NEEDS. BY THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE C. U. S. PROGRAM IS ESTIMATED IT WILL SUCCESSFULLY HIRED ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. TO MEET WORKLOAD NEEDS. THE TOTAL RESOURCES REQUESTED ALLOW CALTRANS TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE ON THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY ENABLING EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE GOODS AND SERVICES. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE COS PROGRAM ON WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ITS COMMITMENT TO DELIVER PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCTION AND OVERSEE THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CURRENTLY FUNDED OR EXPECTED BE FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. OR BY OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. RESOURCES CONTAINED THIS REQUEST -- CRUCIAL COMPONENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AN INSURER THE CONTINUED ECONOMY AND LIVABILITY OF CALIFORNIA. NOW AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. RECALLING THE LA ON A SECOND BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE SURPRISED ON THESE OUT YEAR INCREASES THAT YOU HAD COULD YOU. ANTICIPATE THE QUESTION AND COMMENT ON THAT. SURE MISTER CHAIR -- AS WE DID IN LAST YEAR'S FINANCE LETTER WE'VE PROJECTED -- WITH THE DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE SHOP FROM SENATE BILL. ONE BILLION TO SUBMITTED NEARLY A THREE THOUSAND F. T. E. -- INCREASE OVER THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE PROJECTED THAT ON OUR FIVE YEAR AHEAD PROJECTION. I AND WE CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT SAME PROJECTION IN THE CURRENT FINANCE WATER. AND THAT IS DUE TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF DOLLARS AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PROJECTS GOING OUT THERE. TO PLAN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT THE PROJECTS [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO AS YOU NOTED AND THAT WAY I THINK THERE WAS SOME INITIAL SURPRISE AYE AYE HE DID NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF REVIEWING THAT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT STAFFING INCREASE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- THIS SO JUST IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND I THINK THERE WAS AS MAYBE SOME ELEMENT OF SURPRISE FOLKS GET EXPECTED WE CONTINUE TO GO UP BUT MAYBE NOT. I'M QUITE SO DRAMATICALLY OVER THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED THOSE OUT YOUR PRODUCTIONS THAT THEY PROVIDED LAST YEAR AND IT DOES SHOW THAT SO I'M NOT ENTIRELY AWARE OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND AND WHERE SOME OF THAT CAME FROM. AND RELATIVE TO THIS I REQUEST WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE NINETEEN TWENTY AND PROPOSAL IT'S A RELATIVELY MODEST INCREASE. AND AS WAS STATED IT'S AND FORTY EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WHICH AMOUNTS TO ACTUALLY HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE STATE -- STAFF POSITIONS THIS IS BASICALLY JUST BRINGING DOWN THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STAFF TO SORT OF MORE OF THE HISTORICAL LEVELS AND NOW THAT. THE DEPARTMENTS OUT OF THAT IMMEDIATE YOU KNOW NEED TO BRING ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RIGHT I'M AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB. ONE AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS YEAR OF HAVING A PRETTY MODEST INCREASE PROVIDES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- TO GET MORE INFORMATION OF BEFORE AND POTENTIAL REQUESTS FOR FUTURE INCREASES COME DOWN THE LINE AND THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO OR THREE ON TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE ANOTHER YOU KNOW THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND POSITION REQUEST -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE PAST OUR OFFICE HAS A HANDSOME AND CONCERNS I'M ABOUT THE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY IN THE PROJECT ESTIMATING MASSIVE METHODOLOGY USED BY CALTRANS. AND AN IMPASSE REVIEWS FOUND THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY TO OVERSTATE THE NEED FOR RESOURCES AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAD A WORKING GROUP THAT HAD -- SIMILAR FINDINGS AS WELL. IN RESPONSE TO THOSE CONCERNS MANY CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS -- INTERNALLY TO IMPROVE THEIR AND THEIR BUDGETING PROCESS TO IMPROVE THEIR I'M DATA TRACKING AND THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THERE SYSTEM THAT WILL TIMIDLY RESULTS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST. ON THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE INACTIVE ENACTMENT OF ON SB ONE AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATION HAS GIVEN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THIS ROLE IN DOING PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT -- WHERE YOU HAVE AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT ENTITY NOW? OVERSEEING -- MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DO FOR OTHER CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND BECAUSE CALTRANS IS SO LARGE IN THE NUMBER PROJECTS IS SO GREAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING CAPITAL L. A. B. C. PIECE TO REVIEW FOR EVERY PROJECT. THAT'S MORE AND A SORT OF A A CAT IN LINE WITH THE FUNCTION THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- PERFORMS IN ALLOCATING TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS SO WHAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND IS THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. REQUIRING THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- TO DO A LOOK BACK ANALISIS ON A SAMPLE OF PROJECTS ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT WHAT IT THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE IT WAS GOING TO NEED HOW DID THAT CHANGE OVER TIME AND WHERE DID WE ACTUALLY. I AM AND THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL ON IN A NUMBER OF WAYS NOT ONLY IN FORMING COS BUT JUST I MEAN AN UNDERSTANDING -- WHAT AT THE TIME LINES AND COSTS CHANGES LOOK LIKE FOR PROJECTS OVER TIME ON AND THEN THEY COULD COMPARE THAT TO THE AMOUNT THAT WAS REQUESTED IN THE BUDGET FOR THOSE PROJECTS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? UNDER SB ONE CALTRANS HAS TO SHOW WHAT 10%. EFFICIENCY SAVINGS THAT THE THAT THE GOOD TO THE ONE ON TO DELIVER YOUR PROJECTS IF I RECALL BUT IT VOTED ON ONE HUNDRED YEAH A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MILLION EACH YEAR SO THEY THEY'VE GOT TO REPORT. TO US INTO CTC TTC ANY WAY THAT THEY'VE GOT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS YEARS SAYING THAT THE WE WANT THEM TO LOOK BACK. AT THESE PROJECTS AND SHOW ADDITIONAL SAVINGS OR JUST. TO THE CONNECT THE DOTS AND HOW THEY GOT THAT SAVING YOU THINK IT'S MORE CONNECTING THE DOTS IS NOT NOT NECESSARILY SHOWING SAVINGS BUT LOOKING AT I'M REALLY GETTING TO THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATES. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY AND CAL TRANS OR THE PROJECT MANAGERS ARE SOMEWHERE INCENTIVIZE WE HAVE A MISALIGNED INCENTIVE. FOR THEM TO OVER ESTIMATE THE BUDGET -- IF THEY'RE BEING HELD THE COMING IN HONOR UNDER BUDGET AND THEY YOU KNOW S. ESTIMATORS MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT CONSERVATIVE WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY NEED. AND THE AND IN ADDITION IF CALTRANS HAS TO GO TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION EVERY TIME THERE'S A CHANGE -- AND THAT'S AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY PERHAPS I DON'T WANT TO DO AND SORT OF A HIGHLIGHTS IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE PROJECT WORK JUST TAKES ADDITIONAL STAFF AND A SHELL TIME. SO THERE AND THE IN PAST REVIEWS AND LOOKING AT HOW THE ESTIMATE PROJECT BUDGETS I'M A FOR SOMEONE. UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE THERE DO SEEM TO BE SOME OF THESE INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO OVER ESTIMATE WHAT IS NEEDED AND SO. WENT WHEN THOSE SAME ESTIMATES ARE THAN FEEDING INTO THINGS LIKE BUDGET REQUEST IT BECOMES VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW WAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO RESIST TOO MUCH AND HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT IT AND SO. HAVING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION NOW THAT YOU'VE TASK THE CTC WITH DOING THIS PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. TO TAKE THAT OVERSIGHT AND THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE COLLECTING AND REPORT BACK IN A HELPFUL WAY AND MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE HUNDRED MILLION IS THAT AND THE IT IF THAT'S SORT OF A SEPARATE. PIECE -- AND THAT THAT WHAT'S BEING REPORTED THERE MY IN OF IDENTIFY CERTAIN PROJECTS SAVINGS BUT NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THE ACCURACY OKAY. THANK YOU I'M. QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAVE. OKAY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS HOLD OPEN WE HAVE YOUR NECKS ITEM ON THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THEN I'LL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING ON BOTH. ISSUES FOUR AND FIVE LET'S HAVE A THE GENERAL. COME ON IN. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. GOOD IN GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON AND CENTERS. I AM NOT THE GENERAL HI. THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS. YOU'RE IN ORTEGA WAS APPOINTED TO OVERSEE THE AS THE DIRECTOR OF CAL HR AND SO SHE'S LEFT US UNTIL I'M -- CURRENTLY OVERSEEING THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF ALL TO INVESTIGATION. AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JEAN CHEER WHO IS THE CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. SO THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF OURS INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION REQUEST LANGUAGE BE ADDED TO THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT AFFORD SIMILAR PROTECTIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY STATUTE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CHAPTER FIVE STATUE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN VESTED THE O. I. G. WITH FULL AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING A FULL SCOPE. INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE AUDIT AND INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE SPECIFIED POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IDENTIFIED IN SB. ONE FOR THE ID DID NOT PROVIDE FULL ACCESS TO INFORMATION OR THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL BY LAW. THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH THE IG AND THE LEGAL DIVISION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT THIRD INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPROMISING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE ARE PROPOSING HARMONIZING THE AUDITING STATUTES FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS AND THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THIS PROPOSAL LANGUAGES SIMILAR TO THE PROTECTIONS ALREADY. STATUTORILY PROVIDED TO THE STATE OTHER AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. IF CONFIDENTIALITY OF DOCUMENTS CANNOT BE PROTECTED IT WILL HAMPER THE O. I. G.'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT COMPLETE AND THOROUGH AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. A LINE IN THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. LANGUAGE IS NOT INTENDED TO BROADEN THE AUTHORITY OF THE O. I. G.. BUT TO AVOID POTENTIAL CONFUSION BETWEEN VARIOUS STATE AUDIT STATUTES. THE CURRENT STATUTES REFERENCE IN SB ONE PERTAIN TO THE AUTO RESPONSIBILITIES -- THIRTY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INTERNAL ESOS THAT AUDIT PROGRAM WOULD BE AFFORDED THE CONFIDENTIAL AT HIM PROTECTIONS OF THAT DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER BECAUSE SB ONE SPECIFICALLY CREATED THE IG TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE APARTMENT. THE INTERNAL AUDITING STATUTES IN SB ONE ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS. AND DO NOT ADDRESS THE PROTECTIONS INC OF CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS OR COMMUNICATIONS. THEREFORE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING. A COMMON UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO AND WHICH ARE EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE. WHICH WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE IG AND THE DEPARTMENTS LEGAL COUNSEL. IT WOULD AVOID CONFUSION BETWEEN WHAT CAN OR CANNOT BE PROVIDED TO THE O. I. G.. U. I. G. AND THE DEPARTMENT CAN FOCUS MORE RESOURCES ON THEIR CORE MISSIONS RATHER THAN ON DISCLOSURE DISPUTE. AND BY PROMOTING PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE A CORE VALUE FOR BOTH THE IG AND THE DEPARTMENT. IN SUMMARY THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAN'T AND CAN CONTINUE WITHOUT COMPROMISING. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WITHOUT THE ASSURANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY THE IDEAS UNABLE. TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE DEPARTMENT NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE RESPONSIBILITIES OUTLINED IN SB. ONE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OVER GENE THAT YOU MAY HAVE AT THIS TIME EVEN THE SO I THINK OF FROM UNDERSTAND THERE'S INTERNAL AUDITS VERSES. EXTERNAL AUDIX I GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE AND ARSINOE STAFF REPORTS INDICATING THAT THE THE GENERAL HAS THAT RIGHT TO IF HE BELIEVES THAT THAT DISCLOSURE IS GOING. TO BUT THIS IS POTENTIALLY -- EXPOSE SOMEBODY TO RETALIATION OR THE FEAR OF RETALIATION THAT SHE CAN SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY RIGHT RIGHT NOW [inaudible] I'M. THIS IS A BROADER. YOUR SCOPE THAN JUST THE THREE YELLING INTERNAL AUDIT SHOP BE BASICALLY BEFORE SB ONE RIGHT REPORTED TO THE DIRECTOR -- OF THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AND AS SUCH AS AN INTERNAL LOT OF SHOP I WAS ABLE ALSO TO BE AFFORDED THE PROTECTION ALSO THE CONFIDENTIALITY BE NEVER SHARE INFORMATION. WITH THE DEPARTMENT LEGAL COUNSEL NOW AS AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT -- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL YOU'RE IN ORTEGA HAD AND ALSO JEANS YEAR WAS WE ARE NO LONGER. AFFORD THOSE SAME PROTECTIONS OF THE CAN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION. SO I DON'T KNOW I'M HOPEFUL I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION TO BUT THERE ARE IN IF YOU LOOK SPECIFICALLY THE STATUTES THAT ARE IN SB ONE AND WHAT THEY'RE OUTLINED THEIR ALL WORRIES FOCUSED ON AN INTERNAL LOT OF SHOPPING ORGANIZATION.

WELCOME BACK. ALL THINGS LEAD TO CALTRANS PROPERTY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR CENTERS JIM DAVIS SPECIAL VISOR DIRECTOR BERMAN A CALTRANS WITH MS CLARK PAULSON DIVISION CHIEF OF BUDGETS. CALTRANS HAS THE DIFFICULT TASK OF ADRESSING TRASH ON OUR ROADS. THIS IS TRAVIS A CALTRANS DOES NOT CREATE BUT IS GENERATED FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES SUCH AS LITTERING. ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENTS ILLEGAL DUMPING. AND REFUSE COMING OFF TRUCKS THAT ARE NOT TOO HARD HEADED DOWN THE HIGHWAY. TRANSCANADA IS ROAD IS THE RESULT OF A PERVASIVE SOCIAL ISSUE THAT REQUIRES INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS. AND ENGAGEMENT. CALTRANS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS TRASH ON OUR ROADS INCLUDE FUNDING PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS. TO THE TRASH PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED AT ITS STORES. CALTRANS WORK HARD TO COMPLY WITH A STATEWIDE STORMWATER PERMIT INCLUDING ADDRESSING TRASH AND RUNOFF FROM CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY. CALTRANS SHARES MUTUAL GOALS WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WATER QUALITY BOARD OR REGIONAL WATER BOARD. IN ENHANCING THE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCING IN ENSURING TRASH DOES NOT REACH CALIFORNIA'S WATER WAY. CALTRANS TRASH CONTROL EFFORTS INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION OF TRASH CAPTURE DEVICES ON ROADSIDES IN MANUAL TRASH CLEAN UP EFFORTS THROUGH ITS MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS PROMOTING PUBLIC AWARENESS. TRASHCAN UPS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE. CALTRANS IS GOOD INCREASED AS LITTLE REMOVAL EFFORT IN EXPENDITURES FROM APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO MORE THAN TWENTY THREE MILLION LAST YEAR. DURING TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALTRANS WORKER THREE TOOK WATER BOARD IN THE STATE WATER BOARD TO RESPOND TO A DRAFT CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. OR ORDER. THAT IMPOSES REQUIREMENTS FOR CALTRANS TO IMPLEMENT EXPEDITED TRASH CONTROL MEASURES IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY REGION. THE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE WATER BOARD STAFF AND WENT FOR TOO ATTENTIVE ORDER. AT THE FEBRUARY TWENTY NINTH REGIONAL WATER BOARD MEETING. HOWEVER AT THAT HEARING THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD ADOPTED IN ORDER THAT SETS REVISED SHORTER TIMELINE FOR CALTRANS TEMPERAMENT TRASH CONTROL MEASURES IN A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER AREA. AND THE TENTATIVE ORDER. CALTRANS HAD AN IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH WITH THE TOWN OF ORDER. BUT SINCE THE NEW ORDER REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ACRES OF TREATMENT. A NEW WORK PLAN IS BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE REGIONAL AND STATE WATER BOARD. CALTRANS IN IN THE WATER BOARD SHARE THE GOAL TO DEVELOP A WORK PLAN THE BOW SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES TRASH MAN. DOES NOT IMPACT CALTRANS ABILITY TO MEET STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES. ESTABLISHED BY THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017% A BILL. ONE SUCH AS PAVEMENT AND BRIDGE REPAIR. WE'RE HAVING PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS WITH THE REGIONAL STATE WATER BOARDS TO DEVELOP A WORK PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE ORDER. THE PLAN WILL INCLUDE APPROACHES SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND ACRES OF CREDIT PROVIDED OR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INSTALLATION OF TRASH CAPTURE DEVICES. COOPERATIVE EFFORTS WITH LOCAL STORM WATER PROJECTS. MANUAL TRASH CLEAN UP IN PUBLIC SERVICE CAMPAIGNS TO REDUCE LITTER IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE'RE WORKING TO FINALIZE THAT PLAN THIS SUMMER. NOW AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION. IT THERE WAS TWENTY FIVE ACRE OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES THAT -- THE RIGHT AWAY REGION THE THAT THE THAT THE ORDER CAME DOWN FROM THE REGIONAL BOARD WAS THAT AN EXPANSION OF WHAT THE INTERIM ORDER WAS A YOUR PRESENTATION WAS. AT A HAS THE AIR OF A AT A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF WHAT THE INTERIM WATER WAS VERSUS BUT THE THE ACTUAL ORDER WAS SURE THE TENTATIVE AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WAS AT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES. OUT AND WHEN THE BOARD CAME BACK IT. INCREASED TO EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES [inaudible] OKAY. L. A. L. DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHTS ON THIS PROBLEM SENATE MCGUIRE. ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THAT MISTER DAVIS IN COMMITTEE ME -- THIS IN DISTRICT FOUR SIR -- I'M BOTTOM LINE. BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP. IN A PREVIOUS HEARING ABOUT STAFFING SHORTAGES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT LOOKING AT SOME TYPE OF REGIONAL IMPACT ON PAY [inaudible] BY. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE IN THAT THAT CALTRANS IS INVESTED MORE TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP ADDITIONAL LETTER TRASH. ALONG THE CORRIDORS BUT JUST BEING ABLE TO GET FOLKS OUT THERE HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE AS WELL AND YOU ALL BEEN ABLE. TO COME UP WITH SOME INNOVATIVE. IDEAS BUT YOU TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK LONG TERM BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES. ESPECIALLY THOSE ENTRY LINE WORKERS AGAIN THE MAN HIRED AND THEN CAME IN THE RETAIN. YOUR MIND. TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS SURE SENATOR. IS THE SUCCESS OF US MEETING THE THE IS NOT DEPENDENT ON US WILL HAVE THE PEOPLE AND STAFF ON BOARD TO GET THE WORK DONE AND SO -- AS YOU STATED WE'VE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME IN IN THE BAY AREA PARTICULARLY IN IN THE MARIN AREA IN IN YOUR AREA. OF VOTE RETAIN THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR NEGOTIATION -- WITH THE UNIONS -- FOR RETENTION TAIPEI ALL OF THAT WAS THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE -- WITH OF ARGUED NINE AND LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS -- WITH OUR MAINTENANCE AS WELL. YEAH I LOOK AT AND I'M NOT GONNA GET IT DO A DEEP DIVE ON TO THIS BUT I THINK. I'M. WHERE THERE WAS REGIONAL DIFFERENCES REGIONAL DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OTHER UNITS? THE CHALLENGE WITH THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IT IS [inaudible] A BULLET. AND I'M ALL CHARACTERIZES A FEW HUNDRED BOX. I AM NOT IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO ATTRACT FOLKS BE ABLE TO GET IN I THINK. AGAIN WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE A LONGER TERM CONVERSATION. WHILE THIS IMPACTS THE NORTH BAY. SAN JOSE'S IMPACTED BY THIS LOS ANGELES IMPACTED BY THIS IS A REALLY NEAT PROGRAM SET DISTRICT FOR IS INTRODUCED AS FAR AS GETTING INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING AT A PRISONER IN JAIL. IN THE MAIN JOB GETTING THE STATE EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS FANTASTIC. I'M WORKING WITH THE MAYOR AND SALAS A DOWN THERE ON THAT. AND BEING ABLE TO RETAIN IT'S JUST BEEN A CHALLENGE SO I'M I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE. HUSTLING. THIS IS NOT AN OFFER ON STONE'S. IN AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH. IF WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HIRE ENOUGH FOLKS WHERE TO GET THE JOB DONE. LIKE TO BE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE A COMPLY ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT HI. I HAVE TO GET BACK TO CENTER RIGHT ON I GET EMAILS YEAH AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF CALTRANS CALTRANS HAS BEEN. HUSTLING TO BE TO GET THIS DONE I AS FAR AS TRYING TO GET FOLKS HIRED AND HAVE SOME RECOGNITION ABOUT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN PAY BECAUSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I GUESS THE THE QUESTION THEN. IS BEGGING TO BE ASK IS WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP DID YOU HAVE WITH THE OTHER PUBLIC PARTNERS THIRD THERE YOU GET NO THE CITY OF OAKLAND. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S GRAN HAVE THE WATER -- VIOLATION ON CALTRANS BUT THIS IS ANGIE SOME PROPERTY THE COUNTY FELLA MEDIA IN A THE CITY OF OAKLAND THE FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT EAST BAY PARK THE SORT OF OF THE A HODGE PODGE OF PUBLIC AGENCY IN. AND THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ARE THERE YOU KNOW IT [inaudible] TO THINGS ARE LEFT BEHIND. MY GREAT TO THE CALTRANS PROPERTY JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE WAY THAT THE THE WATER FLOWS HOW LONG HOW IS THAT ARE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NEXT STEPS THAT YOU'RE TAKING TO COMPLY WITH THIS -- ISSUE AFTER YOU WORK WITH THE REWORKING THE WORK PLAN THEY AT THAT THE REVISED WORK PLAN HOW DOES THAT COOPERATION IF THERE IS COOPERATION I GUESS. MR SURE AS YOU SAID IT IS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM NOT JUST ON CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY BUT ON OUR LOCAL PARTNERS RIGHT AWAY AS AS WELL -- WE WORKING VERY WELL -- WE HAVE WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE -- STARTING THIS WEEK WEEKLY MEETINGS AT STAFF LEVEL -- AND THEN KNOW ONCE A MONTH AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL -- AND MYSELF AND MY COUNTERPARTS IN THE OTHER BOARDS ALL WE ARE MEETING AT EXECUTIVE LEVEL TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS AND RESOLVE ISSUES TO KEEP MOVING THIS FOR TO GET THIS WORK PLAN DONE. BY THIS SUMMER WELL AS REGARDS -- TO PARTNERING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WE DO HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY AREA WITH A LOCAL PARTNERS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD PARTNER TOGETHER AND US CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHERE OUR TRASH IS MAYBE GOING ON TO THEIR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS -- THROUGH THEIR WATER WAYS -- AND DOING COMBINED -- TRASH COLLECTION -- DEVICES TWO SO WE JOINTLY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND SO. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT KIND OF CREDITS DO WE GET FROM THE BOARD FOR DOING THOSE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES IT'S GETTING DWN. TO ALL THE DIFFERENT -- THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON TO ADDRESS THIS WELL WHAT ARE THE CREDITS WE GET FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE AND THAT'S WHAT'S UNDER THE NEGOTIATION CURRENTLY. OKAY THAT'S THE THIS VIOLATION ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING MEMBERS OF HE PUBLIC THAT ARE HERE THIS IS THE INFORMATIONAL ITEM ON THE BAY AREA. STORMWATER PERMIT VIOLATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DAVID LEWIS EXECUTIVE RECORD SAY THE BAY THANK YOU FOR A CHEN ISING THIS ITEM AND ITEM SIX ACTUALLY POSES ALL OF THE RIGHT QUESTIONS IN YOUR MEMO TODAY. AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANSWERS TO ANY OF THEM SO I'M I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT -- YOU MENTIONED AND THEN MAKE SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR YOUR ACTION ON THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST HIGHLIGHTED THE THE INTERSECTING OBLIGATIONS OF CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH CALTRANS ACTUALLY FLOWS IS THE OTHER WAY TOO BECAUSE THE TRASH THAT CALTRANS IS NOT INTERDICTING FROM GETTING IN THEIR STORE. ARE COUNTING AGAINST THE CITY'S LIMITS THEY ARE UNDER LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO REDUCE THEIR TRASH BEFORE IT GETS INTO CREEKS THE BAY IN THE OCEAN. AND THE FAILURE OF CALTRANS TO DO MORE SOONER IS ACTUALLY IMPACTING THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE THAT MANDATE. AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS NOW A REQUIREMENT UNDER LAW. AND YOU AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE LEADERS THE GOVERNOR HAVE ALL SAID THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE SECOND TO NONE IN ENFORCING. WATER POLLUTION LAWS INCLUDING FEDERAL LAWS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY ATTACKING AN UNDER CUTTING. AND THIS IS THE LARGEST STATE AGENCY THAT IS VIOLATING WATER POLLUTION LAWS SO IF. IT DOESN'T MEET THESE TARGETS THAT ARE NOW LAID OUT IN THE CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. WE ACTUALLY IN OUR IN THE UNENVIABLE POSITION OF ONE STATE AGENCY THE WATER BOARD HAVE A POTENTIALLY HAVING TO ISSUE FINES AND PENALTIES AGAINST OTHER STATE AGENCY. NOW NOBODY WANTS THAT. WE NEED THIS. MATTER DRESSED. IN A SO I AT MINIMUM -- IN THE IN THE IN THE NEXT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME NOT THIS SUMMER YOU NEED ANSWERS. TO THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSED TO CALTRANS. IN IN SPECIFIC ARE THIS YEAR YOU NEED FOR THE BUDGET TO CLEARLY. DEDICATE AND DESIGNATE. WHICH POTS OF MONEY CALTRANS IS AUTHORIZED. AND COMMANDED TO USE TO ADDRESS THIS POLLUTION PROBLEM IT'S NOT OPTIONAL TO MEET THESE TARGETS. V. BUDGET SHOULD DESIGNATE ALSO THAT THE FUNDS THE CALTRANS HOUSE IN THE SHOP PROGRAM OR IN OTHER ACCOUNTS. CAN NOT ONLY BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENSES TO INSTALL THESE TRASH CAPTURE DEVICES OR EQUIVALENT. BUT ALSO FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF THESE DEVICES OVER TIME AND THE CLEANING OUT OF THESE DEVICES DURING THEIR LIFESPAN. IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION AT ALL. OF FROM THE GSA OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT DETERMINE WHAT FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR WHAT PURPOSES THAT NEEDS TO BE SPECIFIED SOMEWHERE IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE. THAT THOSE FUNDS CAN BE ACCESSED FOR THESE POLLUTION REDUCTION OBLIGATIONS. AND IF THAT GOES BEYOND THE SHOP FUNDS AND IT SHOULD ALSO DESIGNATE THAT. BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO YEARS OF DELAY. THE FIRST SET OF TARGETS IN THE CEASE AND DESIST ORDER THAT CALTRANS NEEDS TO MEET TO TREAT TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF ITS RIGHT OF WAY. IS A YEAR FROM NOW IN JUNE. AND FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS EVER BECAUSE THIS IS A PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIONS. THESE ARE OBLIGATIONS TO REDUCE POLLUTION FROM ROADWAYS. NEED TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE. THIS IS A BAY AREA ISSUE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE CEASE AND DESIST ORDER FROM THE REGIONAL WATER OARD. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD THIS ISSUE FOR CALTRANS STATEWIDE. SO I AM A BIT DISTRESSED AT THE OF SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING THIS MORNING FROM CALTRANS REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS. AND TEACHING PEOPLE NOT TO LITTER AND THAT'S OF COURSE IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE TRASH OR INTERDICTING IT FROM GETTING IN THE WATER WHICH IS CALTRANS OBLIGATION. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PUBLIC AS EDUCATED OR NOT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR CHEN ISING THIS ISSUE AND I URGE YOU TO ADDRESS IT IN THOSE SPECIFIC WAYS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET LANGUAGE. THANKS [inaudible] MY CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING AND ACTUALLY GET BACK TO THE WHEN THE QUESTIONS THE STAFF POSED ON THE BUDGET IMPACT AND THEN. WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING? TO TAKE TO COMPLY WITH THAT. UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR WORK PLAN RIGHT NOW SO IT'S A A MOVING TARGET. BUT DE IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE. AT LEAST IN THIS BUDGET YEAR TO MEET THE THE CHARGE THAT THE NOTICE VIOLATION HAS BEEN. LEVY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BOARDS. WE THINK THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGETS ARE LIKELY TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGETS WITH OUR CURRENT BUDGET RESOURCES SO NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCE. AND IS THAT IT WOULD THERE'S A REQUEST REPORT DISCARDED BE IN THIS WHAT'S THE TIME LINE ON THAT THAT WAS FROM LAST BUDGET SURE. THE STATUS OF THAT REPORT IS -- AS WE STARTED MEETING WITH THE BOARDS -- ON THE TENTATIVE CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. WE REALIZE THAT TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE REQUEST FOR THAT REPORT WE NEED A PATH THAT WORK PLAN -- WE THOUGHT WE HAD THE BASIS OF THAT WORK PLAN BUT WHEN IT WENT TO THE WATER BOARD THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD THAT -- FELL APART. AND SO OUR INTENT IS TO PROVIDE THAT REPORT WHEN WE HAVE THAT WORK PLAN IN INCLUDE THAT WORK PLAN. IN THAT RIVER. OKAY SO BIG PICTURE BECAUSE OF THIS IS A PROBLEM IN IN THE BAY AREA AND THIS IS WHERE THE VIOLATION IS. WE'RE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO OR SANTA BARBARA OR OTHER PLACES THAT WILL BE HERE ARE IMPACTED BY TRASH THE COMES OFF OF THE CALTRANS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BIG PICTURE. WITHIN WITHIN CALTRANS THAT WILL POINT TO ADDRESS THIS. IN ON COMPLIANCE ISSUE I THINK. PRECEDENCE WE SAT WITH THIS WORK PLAN. ARE AND YOU ALWAYS CAN COUNT THE BAY AREA FOR DEATH THAT THAT HELP. BOB IN THAT WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE OTHER REGIONAL WATER BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE OKAY BECAUSE IF IT NEEDS TO BE SEPARATE IN THE BUDGET SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE OF THE FOLKS THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S IT IS WHAT IT IS THIS IS. WE SET UP THE LONG FOR THIS IS THAT THERE'S ARE DESIRABLE OUTCOME. AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE TAKE TO GET THE COLLECTORS AND THE MAINTENANCE AND ALL THAT ALL THAT STUFF WITH THE LABOR. PEACE. LET'S JUST GET IT DONE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL MATTER WE HAVE CONCLUDED OUR BUSINESS OF THE DAY. AND WE'RE TURN
