SPECIALIZING IN THESE ISSUES OF

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.134
OF PROVIDING WORKPLACE

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.834
HARASSMENT.

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.269
BY SEEING THIS ISSUE FROM ALL

SEXUAL HARASSMENT MYSELF A FEW

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:29.447
TIMES EARLY IN MY CAREER.

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:33.785
OF ALL WHICH LED ME TO START.

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.753
IT IS CURRENTLY A 45% CULTURE

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.189
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY PROVIDING

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.891
ONLINE EDUCATION ON SEXUAL

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.392
HARASSMENT BIAS IN ETHICS

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.393
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT UP

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.561
LEVELING PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.696
OF SKILLS.

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.831

HEALTHIER WORKPLACE CULTURE.

POINTS --

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.575
TODAY AND STARTING WITH.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.744
WHY S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.245
WILL MOVE US FORWARD

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:01.546
[inaudible]

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:03.581
SO.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.883
I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.386
CREATE RESPECTFUL WORKPLACES

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:10.988
WHICH IS I THINK A TERM USED IN

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.123
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CODE

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.591
CALLED NINE FORTY SUBJECTION QUE

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.659
WERE ALL OF US HAVE ALL

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:15.960
EMPLOYERS HAVE AN OBLIGATION FOR

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:17.662
RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.764
VAN MANDATING HARASSMENT

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:20.698
TRAINING JUST FOR THE

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:23.301
SUPERVISORS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:24.802
A ENOUGH CRITICAL MOMENTUM TO

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:26.471
ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CULTURE

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:27.805
RIGHT SO THE MANAGERS ARE

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.073
TYPICALLY ONE FOURTH OF AN

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.275
ORGANIZATION --

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.744
AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.312
OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'RE NOT

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.113
YOU'RE NOT INFLUENCING YOUR NOT

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:36.914
AFFECTING.

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.649
PLUS THOSE EMPLOYEES THE NON

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:40.485
MANAGERS ARE THE ONES THAT

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.920
TYPICALLY NEED THE SUPPORT THEIR

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:44.222
LAST THEIR LESS EMPOWERED

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.257
THEY'RE USUALLY MORE JUNIOR --

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.159
LESS SAVVY LESS INFORMED ABOUT

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:50.895
THEIR RIGHTS AND LESS EMPOWERED

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:52.196
TO EFFECTUATE THEIR OWN

00:33:52.263 --> 00:33:53.364
SITUATIONS SO THOSE ARE THE

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.400
FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED THE

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:57.568
SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE --

00:33:57.635 --> 00:34:00.004
OF A PROGRAM LIKE EDUCATION AND

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:02.407
AND GUIDANCE ON THESE ISSUES

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:02.707
[inaudible]

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.342
ALSO.

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.878
PROVIDING EDUCATION TO THOSE

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.813
EMPLOYEES IDEALLY SHOULD JUST BE

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.382
TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS SO

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.050
MANAGERS HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:14.385
SET OF OBLIGATIONS.

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.020
OF REFLECTING THEIR MANAGERIAL

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:19.624
DUTIES AND THAT'S WHY IT AB.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.258
EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MANDATED TO

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.559
OUR PROGRAM.

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.728
AS EMPLOYEE YOU NEED A LOT LESS

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.296
THAN THAN THAT INFORMATION AND

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.697
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING A

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.598
ONE HOUR PROGRAM TAILORED TO

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.600
THEIR NEEDS.

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:31.702
SECONDLY S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:34.038
THREE IT WILL EXPAND THE THE

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.108
TRAINING MANDATE. TO EMPLOYERS

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:39.410
WHICH JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES --

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.778
AND CURRENTLY IT'S EMPLOYERS

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.413
WITH FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND I THINK

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.683
THIS IS HELPFUL BECAUSE THESE

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.151
SMALL BUSINESSES THE EMPLOYERS

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:49.020
WERE JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES UP TO

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.254
FIFTY ARE USUALLY THE ONES THAT

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.989
HAVE LESS STAFF --

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:54.125
AND LESS PEOPLE ABLE TO CREATE A

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:56.160
PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT --

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.929
AND SO.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:58.796
THE EMPLOYEES OF THOSE

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:01.098
BUSINESSES ARE USUALLY THE ONES

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:03.468
THAT ARE MORE VULNERABLE.

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:04.302
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS STAFF

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:05.937
THERE'S LESS PEOPLE TO CREATE A

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:07.638
PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.373
EIGHT EDUCATING GUIDE SO BY

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.308
DOING -- A

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.043
MANDATE THAT THAT APPLIES TO

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:14.912
MORE EMPLOYERS I THINK THAT YOUR

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:16.647
SURVEYING AND SUPPORTING I FELT

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.115
VERY LARGE DEMOGRAPHIC HERE IN

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:19.817
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:20.852
COUPLE OTHER POINTS CURRENT

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.453
REQUIREMENTS.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.156
A ON AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE SO

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:26.591
CURRENTLY THE THE LAW MANDATES

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.392
HARASSMENT TRAINING OF EMPLOYERS

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.561
WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES --

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.396
THE SUPERVISORS OR MANAGERS TWO

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.098
HOURS OF INTERACTIVE CONTENT%

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:37.068
EVERY OTHER YEAR.

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:37.668
I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.670
ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T WORK ABOUT

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:42.039
THAT -- SO

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.508
UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE LAST

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.543
DECADE OR SO.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.011
THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY HAS

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:49.380
LARGELY TAKEN A DEFENSIVE

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:51.816
POSTURE WITHOUT AND WHAT I MEAN

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:52.850
BY THAT IS THEIR INTENT.

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.352
IN ALL THE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.087
THAT NEED HAS LARGELY BEEN

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.322
DRIVEN BY A NEED.

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.925
TO REDUCE OR MINIMIZE CLAIMS.

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.660
AND YOUR INTENT USUALLY DICTATES

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.695
THE OUTCOME YOU GET.

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:05.696
AND SO BECAUSE THE ATTACK HAS

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:08.466
BEEN EMPLOYER DRIVEN TO REDUCE

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.268
OR DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS YOU'RE

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.469
NOT GETTING.

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.803
AN UP LEVELING OF SKILLS AND

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.406
EDUCATION.

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:16.240
WHAT IS CHANGE IN OUR

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.174
ENVIRONMENT I THINK WHAT'S

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:19.410
CHANGED IS DEMOGRAPHICS AND

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.245
SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.114
SO I SAY DEMOGRAPHICS.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.650
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.118
HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN WELL

00:36:27.184 --> 00:36:28.152
REPRESENTED IN THE POWER

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:30.154
STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONS.

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.155
FEELING MORE AND MORE

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:32.423
COMFORTABLE TO SPEAK UP.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.758
AND LESS TOLERANT OF BAD

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.927
BEHAVIOR.

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:36.494
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SOCIAL

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.496
MEDIA SO THAT ANYONE AN

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.997
ORGANIZATION WHO IS COMFORTABLE

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:42.633
SPEAKING UP CAN NOW EASILY SHINE

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.802
A LIGHT ON BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.305
SELL LESS TOLERANCE FOR BAD

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:48.739
BEHAVIOR AND MORE VISIBLE

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:51.709
VISIBILITY INTO BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:54.078
LASTLY WHAT WORKS --

00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:56.180
IN THE TEN PLUS YEARS THAT --

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:58.149
I'VE BEEN IT AND TRAIN WORKING

WITH WORK FORCES IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:02.753
SO WE WORK WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.388
WORK FORCES IN CALIFORNIA --

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:05.890
MIDSIZE WORK FORCES ALL THE WAY

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.893
UP TO FORTUNE FIFTY WORK FORCES.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.294
AND REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE AND

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.129
INDUSTRY VERTICAL THERE ARE

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.397
THERE ARE A FEW COMMON

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:14.732
DENOMINATORS IN TERMS OF THINGS

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.334
THAT DO WORK.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.604
SO WHAT TYPICALLY WORKS IS

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.407
GENERALLY GOOD QUALITY CONTENT --

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:24.542

THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:40.858
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS.

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.793
YOU NEED TO GET FOLKS IN THE

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.295

OFTEN SHADES OF GRAY.

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.303
AND SO YOU NEED TO EDUCATE FOLKS

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.704

THERE WE CAN'T HIRE FOR SO SO

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.707
ULTIMATELY IT WAS AN EMINENTLY

REASONABLE AMENDMENT THAT WE ASK

AMENDMENT BUT WAS REJECTED.

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.533

THIS IS YOU CAN'T HIRE SOMEBODY

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.144
OF THEFT AND EMBEZZLEMENT.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.679
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DISCERNING

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:50.814
WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUALS

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.715

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.219
HIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T PULL FOR

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:58.288
BACKGROUND CHECK SO HOW WOULD

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.889
THE INSTITUTION KNOW THAT THAT

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:01.257
INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:04.027
A CRIME.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:05.128

BACKGROUND CHECK ONLY ON THEFT

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:09.799
EMBEZZLEMENT.

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.301
IS ORGAN THOUGH YOU GET THE

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.736
ENTIRE REPORT.

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.704
AND BY VIRTUE OF THAT IF FORCES

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:15.572
A TO THERE'S A TECHNICAL

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:16.906
VIOLATION THE BILL BECAUSE THE

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:18.141

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.677
ANYTHING BUT A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:21.544

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:27.150
WORK.

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.551
SO WHY NOT JUST HAVE AN

00:56:28.618 --> 00:56:30.754
AMENDMENT THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.921

GETTING CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT TO

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.812
BE A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.181
WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:40.516
OFTEN WE JUST LOOK.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.818
A YEAR OR TWO AHEAD BUT TO

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.253
ACTUALLY ANTICIPATED CHANGES

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.087
WERE TO SEE IN THE WORK FORCE

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.088

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.824
MOVE -- A

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:49.725
LOT FASTER IN TERMS OF OUR

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.295
ANALYSIS OF WHAT JOBS ARE GONNA

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.130
LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURETHE PACE

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.831
OF TECHNOLOGY GROWTH.

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.233
THE BENEFITS OF THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.069
BUT ALSO IMPACTS IT MAY HAVE ON

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.704
THE MIDDLE CLASS KNOWN INCOME

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.706
INEQUALITIES SO --

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.107
WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.543
AROUND AUTOMATION AND IT'S BEEN

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.745
A CONSTANT SOURCE OF

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:12.481
CONVERSATION BUT THE GOAL I

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:13.416
THINK FOR ALL OF US IS

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.483
CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD BE TO GET TO

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.452
THE POINT WHERE.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.187
WE ACTUALLY WE CAN EMBRACE

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:20.122
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND STILL

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.258
HAVE A DURABLE MIDDLE CLASS.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.726
AND IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:25.828
MARRY THOSE TWO THINGS.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.197
THAT TO ME IS A TRANSCENDENT

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.765
KIND OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT TO

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.033
THIS BILL IS SORTED SUPPOSED TO

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.702
FORM THE THINK TANK THAT

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:33.703
EVENTUALLY.

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.771
WILL HELP GET THE NEXT GOVERNOR

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.306
THOSE KINDS OF IDEAS ANNOUNCES

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.008
LEGISLATURE THOSE KIND OF IDEAS.

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.776
DOESN'T REALLY PUT A THUMB ON

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.245
THE SCALE EITHER WAY BUT WE

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.547
DON'T DO LABOR DEMAND ANALYSIS

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:45.748
IN A SERIOUS WAY IN THIS STATE

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.183
WE DO AN ECONOMIC REPORT THAT

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.217
NONE OF US REALLY READ EVERY

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.052
YEAR BUT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO PUT

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.120
SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.355
THE WORLD. TO WORK FOR

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.956
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IN SO

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.625
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ASSEMBLY

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.827
OF THIS COMMISSION AND THAT'S

01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:00.096
THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.597
SPEC WE ASK.

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.531
FOR THANK YOU YOU HAVE SOME

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.834
WITNESSES FOR US YEAH.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.502
MR SHARE MEMBER SARAH FLOCKS

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.704
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AN

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:11.841
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY --

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:12.642
SO.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:15.311
WE'VE BASICALLY HAVE.

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.479
A THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.814
TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.883
BRING ENORMOUS GOOD TO MAKE WORK

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.485
SAFER TO MAKE IT MORE PRODUCTIVE

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.187
TO HAVE BENEFITS FOR SOCIETY.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.856
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF IT IS

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:29.725
LEFT UNCHECKED IT ALSO HAS THE

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.494
POTENTIAL TO EXACERBATE THE ALL

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.663
THE INJUSTICES WE SEE.

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.498
INCOME INEQUALITY WAGE

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:38.034
STAGNATION AND POLITICAL

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.002
POLARIZATION THAT IS DIVIDING

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.837
OUR COUNTRY.

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:44.473
AND SO WE DO THINK IT IS TIME

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.875
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.777
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF WORK GONNA

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:49.011
BE WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:50.613
TECHNOLOGY WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.213
AUTOMATION ARTIFICIAL

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:51.514
[inaudible]

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.082
TELLIGENT.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.250
AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:55.584
CONVERSATION WITH OUR MEMBERS

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.053
AFFECTED OUR LAST CONVENTION WE

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.654
HAD SIX HUNDRED UNION MEMBERS IN

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.722
THE RAIL.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:00.323
AND WE BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.858
OF HOW IS HOW IS TECHNOLOGY

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.627
IMPACTING YOU.

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:07.096
AND WE HEARD THAT EVERY WORKER

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.597
EVERY OCCUPATION.

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:11.967
EVERY INDUSTRY IS ALREADY SEEING

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.736
TECHNOLOGY.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:14.770
CHANGING THEIR INDUSTRIES HAVING

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:18.240
AN IMPACT EVERYONE FROM HOTEL

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.443
WORKERS THAT ARE SEEING HOTELS

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:21.977
THAT ARE BEING DESIGNED TO BE

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.246
COMPLETELY AUTOMATED WE CHECK IN

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.948
ON A KIOSK AND YOU HAVE A LITTLE

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.316
ROBOT THAT BRINGS ROOM SERVICE

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.317
TO YOUR ROOM.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.685
SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR FRONT

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:31.020
DESK WORKERS REPRESENTED BY THE

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:33.322
TEAMSTERS OR HOUSEKEEPERS UPPER

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.624
NEEDED REPRESENTED BY UNITE HERE.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.393
TO ACTORS THAT ARE SEEN DIGITAL

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.427
IMAGES OF THEMSELVES

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:41.097
[inaudible] TO I NEED W.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.866
WORKERS AT EIGHTEEN ANTI. TO BUY

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.501
HOSPITAL WORKERS DOCTORS AND IN

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.570
THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TWO THE FACT

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:48.771
THAT WE'RE USING ALGORITHMS FOR

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.339
EVERYTHING.

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.874
LOOKING OUT AT FOR EVERYTHING

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:55.378
FROM MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.979
TO SAYING WHAT IS THIS PERSON

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.414
SOMEONE THAT WE SHOULD SEE HOW

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.416
WE SHOULD WE SET THEIR BAIL.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:04.186
AND SO ALL TECHNOLOGY IS.

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.554
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:07.490
ROBOTS WILL BE TAKING OUR JOBS

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.625
BUT MOST LIKELY WE'RE GONNA SEE

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.093
TECHNOLOGY CHANGING THE

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.462
WORKPLACE IN VERY GRADUAL WAYS

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.297
AND WILL BE SEEING PARTS OF OUR

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.166
JOB THAT WILL BECOME AUTOMATED.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.934
AND WE'LL BE SEEING CERTAIN TAX

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.003
THAT WILL BE AUTOMATED AND THESE

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:21.904
CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.572
SLOWLY BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:25.408
PROFOUND IMPACT.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.543
ON THE FUTURE OF WORK ON OUR

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.911
ECONOMY ON THE WEEK WE COLLECT

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.647
TAXES ON THE STATE AS A WHOLE.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.416
M. AND SO WE REALLY SEE THIS

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:34.650
COMMISSION.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.685
AS A WAY TO GET AHEAD OF THAT.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.554
TO SAY THAT THE STATE HAS AN

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.190
IMPORTANT ROLE AND WE'RE GONNA

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.458
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE SEE

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:43.626
THIS COMING WE HAVE THE

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.194
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CHANGE AND

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:45.795
WE ACTUALLY WE KNOW HOW TO DO

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.663
THIS.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.898
IN FACT PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:49.799
HEARD BAY.

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:52.067
RIGHT HERE GOVERNOR BROWN HAS

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:14.156
THE QUOTE IS WE WILL EXPLORE

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:15.691
EVERY FACTOR INVOLVED IN

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.526
AUTOMATION TO HELP US DEVELOP

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.595
THE MEANS TO COUNTERACT ANY

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.062
ADVERSE EFFECT OF THIS

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.197

WE DON'T TRUST THEM.

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.851

THAT'S NOT AND I THINK YOU FORTY

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:25.888
EFFORT ACTUALLY THAT IS LONG

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.623
OVERDUE THAT WE START LOOKING IN

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:28.490
THE FUTURE.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.392
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS IN

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.628
THE FORM OF A MAN MADE OR OR IS

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:35.664
A WEEKEND MAKE SURE --

WE TAKE CARE ONE THING --

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.902
YOU KNOW WHAT ONE WHEN I HEAR

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.970
THIS JUST DISCUSSION OF STEM THE

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.239
TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE --

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.173
EVEN NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.375
SILICON VALLEY YOU DON'T SEE ANY

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:47.576
AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:50.178
IN ANY MEASURABLE NUMBER --

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.580
HOPEFULLY THIS MIDDLE CLASSES

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.915
AND LIKE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:53.882
THAT'S GONNA COME UP THAT WE'RE

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.617
TRYING TO RAISE AND THAT'S ALL

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:56.852
WE'RE CONCERNED WITH AS OF HIS

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.120
THE WAY WE CAN.

INCLUDE THAT.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.456
IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF HOW WE GET

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:04.793
ON AFTER AMERICAN LATINOS

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.661
INVOLVED IN THIS OTHERWISE OF

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.329
BEACHES ALL WHITE NATION AND

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.030
THAT'S NOT.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.132
GOOD FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE YOU

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:12.267
KNOW WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT STAR

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.702
WARS STAR TREK IS ONLY ONE BLACK

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.771
GUY WHEN I SEE TERMINATOR

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:16.638
THERE'S NO.

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.440
NO BLACK PEOPLE MANLINESS

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.442
DEATHLY DIFFERS WESTWORLD IS NO

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.477
BLACK PEOPLE IN EVEN OUT A NEW

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.812
ONE TO BLACK PEOPLE ROBUST SO

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:24.379
THEIR SERVANTS WHO SAVED THE

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.013
WHITE PEOPLE.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.748
SO AT SOME POINT[inaudible]

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:29.618
THE WE'VE GOT A IT'S YOU KNOW WE

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.986
CAN GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:33.221
TECHNOLOGY BUT I DON'T LOOK BACK

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.057
AND WE'VE LEFT A WHOLE GROUP OF

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.425
PEOPLE BEHIND.

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.993
IN ALL THOSE I'VE SEEN ANY

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.428
LATINO SO WE WON'T EVEN GO THERE

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:41.830
AND SO AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:42.864
TO JUST SAY IT.

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.200
THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WORLD IS

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.035
LEAVING SOME PEOPLE BEHIND AND

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.837
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.372
ALL INCORPORATED AND WE TALK

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.407
ABOUT HIS NEW MIDDLE CLASS THAT

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.642
INCORPORATES EVERYBODY KIND OF

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:54.876
GETS AWAY.

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.611
THERE AND WE CAN --

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:59.247

HAVE A DISCUSSION OR MAKE IT A

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:01.817
PART OF YOUR STUDY THAT WOULD BE

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:04.086
GREAT.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.520
I SAY YES TO THAT AND I'VE

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.322
ALREADY GOT IDEAS JUST THINKING

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.457
ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IS NOT JUST

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:09.891
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DURABLE

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.527
MIDDLE CLASS BUT IT'S DID LIVE

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:14.396
SAW COMMUNITIES OR AND SORT OF

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:17.165
LOOKING AT SYSTEMATIC INJUSTICE

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.101
SERVED LACK OF ACCESS TO THIS

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:21.069
ECONOMY SO.

HERBS POINT.

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:39.988
ANOTHER IT'S ART IMITATING LIFE

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.323
A LIFE IS IMITATING ART BUT

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:42.958
EITHER WAY --

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.760
IT'S NOT GOOD BUT IN TERMS WHEN

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:45.394
I LIVE RIGHT AND SILICON VALLEY

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.130
AND THIS SUMMER IS CORRECT --

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.731
THERE ARE FAR TOO FEW WOMEN PART

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:52.701

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:57.939
ON EARTH.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:59.174
I MEAN YOU HAVE SOME OF THE

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:00.976
POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS A SILICON

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:02.511
VALLEY MOST GOING ABOVE.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.112
OF LOW INCOME LATINOS ASK

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:07.916
AMERICANS IN AN ASIAN AMERICAN.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:09.751
THIS OTHER ASIAN AMERICANS.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.320
AND SO I'M ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:12.854
THE HOUSE BE PART OF THE

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.489
CONVERSATION --

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:15.857

IMPORTANT.

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.196
I'M.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.531
AND IN I'M IN A GREAT

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.499
PRESENTATION WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:25.100
ON THE DAY OF THE CONFERENCE

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:25.901
UNTIL YOU'VE.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.669

LOOK.

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:36.111
I AND I THINK IF IF TODAY'S ANY

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.779
EXAMPLE THAT WE NEED MORE AND

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:38.547
MORE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:38.847
[inaudible]

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.449
WHAT?

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.684
HOW OUR ACTIONS OR LACK THERE OF

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:43.852
HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:44.419
COMMUNITIES AND ON OUR WORK

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.854
FORCE?

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.690
AND I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.125
CONFERENCES CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.060
AUTOMATION VERY RARELY IS LABOR

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:53.261
AT THE TABLE.

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.930
OR PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WORK IN

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.231
THOSE JOBS ARE GONNA BE

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:57.899
ELIMINATED AT THE TABLE.

01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.534
IT'S MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.169
QUICKLY AUTOMATION FOR HOW MUCH

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.571
MONEY CAN SAVE HOW YOU CAN

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.406
REDUCE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.041
I GET THAT THEIR STAKEHOLDERS

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:07.142
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:09.277
THINGS AND THAT'S OKAY WITH RUBY

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.378
RIDGE SAID THOSE THINGS.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:11.813
BUT WE HAVE TO BE INTERESTED IN

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.515
MORE THINGS ON THAT AND AND AND

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.517
YOU KNOW AUTOMATION IS SPOKEN OF

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.052
IN TERMS OF MAKING LIFE EASIER

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:17.853
FOR FOLKS.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.187
WHAT DOES MAKE LIFE A WHOLE LOT

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.622
EASIER FEET ON THE JOB?

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.958
AND SO I I AND A LOT OF

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.192
COUNTRIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.827
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF EFFICIENCY

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.295
OF PETITIONS HE BEING CREATED

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:29.264
THROUGH AUTOMATION TO TECHNOLOGY.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:30.031
SHOULD MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.000
SHOULD SERVE AS SOME COUNTRIES

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:33.268
AND REDUCED.

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.569
REDUCE WORK HOURS BUT DON'T

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.037
REDUCE WAGES SO YAK HAVE MORE

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.806
FREE TIME HE RIGHT BECAUSE

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:40.208
AUTOMATION THAT'S AUTOMATION IS.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.543
GIVEN TO EVERYONE.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.278
AND NOT JUST OF THE VERY FEW

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:44.679
THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.515
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.083

TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT --

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.236

THE LACK OF DIVERSITY --

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.821
IN TECHNOLOGY AND THIS ARE THE

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:02.424
COMMITTEE HAS ALSO --

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.491
HELD A HEARING.

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.392
CHALLENGE --

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.962
THE TECH SECTOR AND OFFER HELP

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:09.164
TO SAY THAT --

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.298

FOR MANY OF US WORK ADDS VALUE

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:27.282
TO OUR LIVES THE WORK THAT WE DO

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.650
