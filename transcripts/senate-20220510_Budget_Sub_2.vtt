NOTE THAT MULTIPLE SOURCES. AND

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.480

A LACK OF COMMERCIALLY

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.916
DEPLOYABLE CARBON REMOVAL

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.618

FORTY FIVE WILL GO INTO A DEEP

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.425
DISCUSSION ON THAT IS CONTAINED

IN OUR STAFF REPORT AND THIS IS

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.729
EVEN ASSUMING THAT WE- IF WE

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.331
DON'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CARBON

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.433
CAPTURE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE A

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.467
WHOLESALE TRANSITION TO GREEN

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.169
ENERGY ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS

THEM OUR HOPE IS ALSO TO HAVE

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.595
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS PUT ON THE

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.430
RECORD TO THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.565

FORWARD. THANK YOU OKAY GREAT

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.737
SO- THE GOAL MY INITIAL COMMENTS

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.305
ARE REALLY JUST TO KIND OF SET

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.840
THE STAGE FOR THE ISSUE AND

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.541
QUITE A BIT OF CONTACTS SO WITH

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.677
THAT IN MIND I'M GONNA FOCUS MY

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:38.544
COMMENTS IN JUST A FEW MAJOR

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.613
THINGS FIRST YOU KNOW IT JUST

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.914
HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.150
IS THE C. S. SECOND WHAT'S THE

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.818
POTENTIAL ROLE FOR CCS AND QUIET

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.353
MEDITATION. ABSURD WATER SOME OF

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.988
THE AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.024
AND AN EXISTING POLICIES THAT

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.194
PROMOTE CCS. THE FIRST- THE TERM

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.796
CARBON CAPTURE STORAGE OR CCS

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.965
CAN BE USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.066
TO CAPTURE A WIDE RANGE OF

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.401
POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.669
MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES AND

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.704
STRATEGIES SO I WANT THROUGH

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.373
SORT OF A FEW OF THOSE BUT I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.608
THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.677
ISSUE IS JUST A- SORT OF A

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.211
MATTER OF TERMINOLOGY AND

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:12.845
DIFFERENT PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:13.713
TERMINOLOGY SOMETIMES. I THINK

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.314
MOST COMMONLY OF THE TERM CCS

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.550
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.452
APPLIES TO NOT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.888
ARE REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE TO

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.289
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ADMITTED

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.891
AT A PARTICULAR FACILITY LIKE A

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.127
POWER PLANT SO BIOFUEL PLANT OR

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:28.695
INDUSTRIAL FACILITY IN SIR

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:38.438
CAPTURING THAT CARBON. IN THE

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.239
ATMOSPHERE. AND STORING SEPHORA

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.175
OR- IT IN SOME CASES MAKE IT OF

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.344
FOR. SOME PLANTS- ANOTHER

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.680
CATEGORY. KNOWN AS KIND OF

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:48.548
CARBON AND- ROOM. OR SOME CASES

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.750
KIND OF NEW EMISSIONS. AND THESE

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:51.818
ARE. TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU KNOW

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.387
DIRECT TAKE- CARPENTER OUT OF.

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.922
ALSO NOT AT OF PUTS YOU FACILITY

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.357
BUT KIND OF GET OUT OF AIR- THE

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:01.461
IS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS- AFTER

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.362
CAPTURING SOME- AND THERE'S

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.331
OTHER- CUT NATURE. SOLUTIONS ARE

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:08.234
TECH THAT A COURSE ALSO OF- AND

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.369
STORE AND SUPPRESS CARBON- SUCH

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.472
AS KNOW FOR SPANISH CHANGES AND

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.476
WHAT WHAT ANOTHER LIKE THAT- SO

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.244
I THINK. MATTER IS GONNA THE

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.712
BOOK IS A THIS ISSUE THIS ITEM

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.447
IS NOT MORE ON THE KIND OF TECH.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.316
BASED SIDES BUT I JUST WANT TO

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.151
KIND OF PROVIDE THAT CONTEXT IF

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.319
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.520
TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS THAT

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.322
KIND OF STUFF SOMETIMES FALL

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:32.959
INTO THIS TERMINOLOGY. SECOND

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.560
JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:35.762
ROLE FOR SOME THESE.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.863
PARTICULARLY KIND OF TECH

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:41.868
FOCUSED ONES- THEY ARE AS A SURE

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.169
MENTION KIND OF A OFTENTIMES A

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.704
MAJOR PART OF MANY OF THE

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.338
PATHWAYS THAT ARE ANALYZED

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.540
MEETING. BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.942
STATE LEVEL CLIMATE TARGETS- SO

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.010
FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF THE

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.678
SCENARIOS THAT ARE PART OF THE

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.281
IPCC REPORTS I'M TRYING TO SORT

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.383
OF NEED- VARIOUS CLIMATE TARGETS

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.152
INCLUDE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:01.654
AND CCS. SOME OF THE CARDS IN

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.055
AREAS THAT ARE ANALYZED AS PART

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.490
OF THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:07.093
PROCESS ASSUME SOME SIGNIFICANCE

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.895
OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL WOULD

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.432
BE NEEDED- IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.067
AT LEAST. ARMS AND IN GENERAL

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.503
THE THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.540
INCLUDED IN THESE SCENARIOS- IN

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.675
PART TO SORT OF ADDRESS SOME OF

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.210
THE HARD TO DECARBONISE PARTS OF

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.913
THE ECONOMY SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.882
KNOW PROVIDING- OF- ZERO CARBON

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.185
ELECTRICITY- AND KIND OF HIGH

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.586
PERCENTAGE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.621
GRID. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES CCS IS

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:38.124
INCLUDED AS AS AN OPTION FOR-

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.826
NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS TO TRY

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.161
TO HELP BALANCE TO GET THE GRADE

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.596
AND- PROVIDE RELIABLE

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.164
ELECTRICITY AT SOME OF THOSE

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.199
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF RENEWABLES

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.968
RIOS. OTHER TIMES JUST KIND OF

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:49.569
FOCUSED ON INDUSTRIAL SECTORS

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.304
WHICH ARE OFTEN HARD TO

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.405
DECARBONISE AND THERE AREN'T A

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:53.673
LOT OF KIND OF EXISTING

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.807
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.109
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. SO CCS

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.178
IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS OFTEN

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.247
KIND OF HIGHLIGHTED AND IN THAT

CONTEXT AND THEN. THINGS LIKE

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.651
DIRECTOR CAPTURE AND KIND OF

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:12.758
OTHER TYPES OF CARBON RENEWABLE. REMOVAL ARE OFF. I DON'T IF I

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.461
DOES NOT. GETTING A THAT OTHER-

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.063
AREAS OF THE ECONOMY LIKE ABA.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.165
FUEL USE RADIO ARE- ALSO VERY TO

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.467
BE. AND SO- THERE MIGHT BE A

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.336
ROLE FOR SOME OF THE SECT OTHER

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.671
TECHNOLOGIES KIND OF. TO- TO

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:26.472
TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.407
ATMOSPHERE TO KIND OF OFFSET

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.675
SOME OF THOSE THOSE EMISSIONS

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.510
THAT MIGHT REMAIN FOR QUITE

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.846
AWHILE. SO SERVICE AND FINALLY I

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.248
REALLY JUST WANNA. PROVIDE A

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.349
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:37.617
BUDGET AND POLICY LANDSCAPE

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:40.353
HERE- BURSTS THERE WAS SOME

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.888
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.623
THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.258
THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR OR SO

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.393
FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS FUNDING

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.563
FOR- DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS-

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.599

MILLION FOR LARGE SCALE PILOTS.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.108
ALSO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:03.876
MONEY FOR STORAGE TRANSPORTATION

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:06.579
OF CARBON- THREE POINT FIVE

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.681
BILLION FOR DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.517
REGIONAL HUBS- OTHERS ARE JUST

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:12.551
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:13.953
FUNDING THAT WAS A NATURAL

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.055
PACKAGE- THERE ARE SOME ALSO

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:16.956
THEY'RE ALL ALSO IS A FEDERAL

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.659
TAX CREDIT FOR- CARBON CAPTURE

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.962
AND STORAGE I ALSO WANTED TO.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:26.899
RECOGNIZE. THAT AS WELL AND

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:27.767
MENTION THAT. EIGHT LEVEL

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:28.734
THERE'RE IS FUNDING. RELATED TO

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.336
SOME OF THE NATURE BASED-

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.971
SEQUESTRATION SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.773
PROPOSED AS PART OF THE

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.573
ADMINISTRATION'S NATURE BASED

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.275
SOLUTIONS. PACKAGING OF THE

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.144
LEGISLATURE- SET ASIDE FUNDING

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.079
FOR. THINGS LIKE WETLAND

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.147
RESTORATION AND THINGS LIKE

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:44.417
THAT- BUT NOT AS MUCH THAT IS

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.218
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED FOR. A

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.421
TECHNOLOGY FOCUS KIND OF CAPTURE

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.524
AND STORAGE PROJECTS. IN CASE I

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.060
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK IS

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.895
HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR AS WELL AS

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:56.462
THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLEAN

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.465
ENERGY PACKAGE INCLUDED. ALSO

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.599
FOR TO LEARN TEN NO. FOUR

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.635
INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.403
PROJECTS- AT SOME OF THAT

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.906
FUNDING COULD BE USED FOR CARBON

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.240
CAPTURE AND- UTILIZATION

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:10.443
ACTIVITIES I DO WANT TO NOTE

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:11.978
THAT THAT PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.946
EXCLUDED. ARE PROJECTS THAT

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:16.382
WOULD JUST- INCLUDE GEOLOGIC

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.384
STORAGE SO STORING THAT CARBON

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.519
CARBON ESSENTIALLY UNDERGROUND-

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.654
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.922
HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ANALYSIS OF

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.291
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO.

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:26.859
THINK ABOUT- POTENTIALLY SORT OF

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.227
EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY IN TRYING

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.430
TO- EXPLORE SORT OF YOU KNOW

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.599
WHATEVER THAT THE MOST. COST

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.268
EFFECTIVE AND- FEASIBLE OPTIONS

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:40.139
ARE FOR STORING CARBON AND- AS

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.874
TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD SO WANTED

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.409
LIKE THAT AS WELL THERE ARE

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.144
LASTLY THERE ARE SOME OTHER.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.545
POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE THE LOW

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.514
CARBON FUEL STANDARD AT THE

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.849
STATE LEVEL THAT'S- TO PROVIDE

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.484
INCENTIVES FOR SONS DCS

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.754
PROJECTS- MOSTLY FOCUSED ON-

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.821
PRODUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.256
FUELS THERE'S ALSO IT ALSO

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.792
ALLOWS FOR. MONEY TO GO TO

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.395
EVENTUALLY FOR DIRECTOR CAPTURE

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.631
PROJECTS. SO FINALLY- I DO JUST

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.666
WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A- BUT

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.002
THIS IS A TOPIC THAT THERE IS

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.603
PROPOSED LEGISLATION ON ABOUT

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:11.871
RIGHT IT GIVES THE PROPOSED

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:13.372
LEGISLATION AND HOUSE-

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.941
INDISCRETION OF. ARE THE SUBJECT

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:16.542
OF LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSIONS IN

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.011
RECENT YEARS- AND AS YOUR AGENDA

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.780
NOTES THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.282
BUDGET PLAN. DOES INCLUDE TWO

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:26.285
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR- CCS

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.988
PROJECTS. SO I WILL IN MY

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.623
COMMENTS THERE HOPEFULLY THAT

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.426
PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF. LOCAL

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:34.927
CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND ON THE

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:38.364
ISSUE AND- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.865
YOU HAVE. YEAH I. ONE QUESTIONS

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:41.133
READ YOU WHEN YOU WERE TALKING

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.103
ABOUT D. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.706
THAT THE HARD TO- DECARBONIZING

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.675
WE'VE HAD HEARINGS HERE IN SUB

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.310
TO BEFORE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.945
LET'S SEE FOOD PROCESSORS AND

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.814
IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'VE TESTIFIED

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.482
THAT THEY REALLY NEED THE PRICE

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.783
OF CARBON NEEDS TO GET TO BE

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.318
ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS A METRIC

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.986
TON BEFORE IT MAKES SENSE FOR

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.588
THEM TO DECARBONISE. AND I KNOW

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.723
THAT WILL HAVE SOME OPPOSITION

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.058
TO THE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.860
IDEA FROM FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.762
ANY CARBON CAPTURE DID DON'T

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.964
DISCUSS IT AND ALL THAT BUT WE

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:13.632
DO STILL NEED OUR FOOD WITH

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.101
PEOPLE STILL WANT THEIR BABY

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:18.671
LETTUCE IN THE BAG- WOULDN'T

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:21.207
THAT BE. AN IDEAL. SECTOR IF YOU

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:22.641
WERE GOING TO LOOK AT IF YOU'RE

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:23.909
GONNA LOOK AT CARBON CAPTURE

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:25.878
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF. THE FEDERAL

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:27.346
MONEY STEER. AND THEN THEN I

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.515
GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT. THAT

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.016
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A ROAD BLOCK

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.085
GIVEN THE- ADMINISTRATION'S

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.454
LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.557
CAN'T COME. PUT IT BACK HOUSTON

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:40.392
GEOLOGICAL STORAGE IS AN ANSWER

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.995
EVEN IF EVEN IF. THE LOCATION

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:45.998
WAS AYE DELIC. RIGHT FOR CARBON

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.834
STORAGE THIS IS THAT WERE YOU OR

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:52.571
IS IT WORTHY ALEJO. YES SO ON

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:54.874
YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON FOOD

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.409
PROCESSORS I MET I THINK IT- IT

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.845
SEEMS LIKE THAT COULD BE SORT OF

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.247
THE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IN THAT

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:03.382
PARTICULAR SECTOR I MEAN I DON'T

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.950
KNOW. ENOUGH ABOUT ALL THE

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:05.851
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THERE

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:06.986
COULD BE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:07.620
AND OTHER TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.588
COULD WORK BUT I THINK. THE

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:10.890
OVERALL POINT AROUND JUST KIND

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.291
OF INDUSTRIAL SOURCES AND THE

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.859
TYPES OF HEAT THAT THEY MIGHT

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.996
NEED TO PRODUCE THEIR PRODUCTS

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.097
AND THEIR MANUFACTURING. ALSO

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.299
SEES- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SOME OF

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.400
THE OTHER STRATEGIES OF THE

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.002
STATE EMPLOYEES LIKE

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:24.036
ELECTRIFICATION THEY MIGHT NOT-

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.571
WORK IN SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.840
AND SO LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.775
LIKE. ARBEN CAPTURE SEEM LIKE

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.510
THERE- BUT YOU KNOW COULD BE

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:33.512
KIND OF ONE WAY TO. TO MOVE

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.981
FORWARD IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA-

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.416
IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF AN

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.852
ADMINISTRATION'S. PROPOSAL THAT

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.221
WAS PUT FORWARD THAT CAN SORT OF

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.789
EXCLUDES. GEOLOGIC STORAGE YEAH

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.825
I MEAN I THINK- GIVEN SORT OF

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.427
THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE OF

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.361
MEETING CARBON NEWCREST

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:53.132
NEUTRALITY GOALS ANDS- THE KIND

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.567
OF AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S NEEDED

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.001
TO SORT OF TO REACH THOSE GOALS

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:57.503
AND MOST LIKELY THE DIFFERENT

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.871
TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.739
GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MEET THOSE

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.441
GOALS OVER TIME WE- HAVING A

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.943
GENERAL THINK THAT'S- TRYING TO

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.378
FOCUS RESOURCES AND EFFORTS IN A

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:08.147
WAY THAT IS- AS TECHNOLOGICALLY

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:09.582
NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE WHERE THE

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.784
STATE CAN KIND OF EXPLORER- A

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.152
LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.853
CAN KIND OF HELP IT MEET ITS

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.222
CLIMATE GOALS- SEEMS LIKE A

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:17.756
GOOD. HALF GOING FORWARD NOW

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.592
THERE MIGHT BE. SOME INSTANCES

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.060
WHERE- THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.561
STATE'S SORT OF DETERMINES THAT

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:23.896
YOUR PARTICULAR APPROACH GOING

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.631
FORWARD HAS OTHER TRADE OFFS

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.700
THAT IT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE IT

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:28.867
DOESN'T WANT TO KIND OF

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:30.402
SACRIFICE OR OTHER IMPACTS THAT

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.537
IT AND YOU KNOW IT CONCERNS

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:32.771
IT'S- CARES MORE ABOUT SO FOR

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.473
EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE. OTHER

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.209
POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:37.943
AIR POLLUTION OR OTHER

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.445
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THIS. KIND

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:41.614
OF OUR WAY- SOME OF THOSE OTHER

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.848
FACTORS THAT I TALK ABOUT IN

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.016
TERMS OF KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.384
NEUTRALITY THE NIGHT COULD PLAY

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.286
A ROLE BUT- OVERALL FROM A AT

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.654
LEAST FROM A PURELY ECONOMIC

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.889
PERSPECTIVE TRYING TO. EXPLORE

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.791
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.560
COULD. HELP THE STATE COST

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.995
EFFECTIVELY MEET SOME OF THE

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.363
SOME OF THESE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.398
GOALS WE THINK IS A IT IS A GOOD

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.900
STRATEGY GOING FORWARD. AND THAT

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.535
WOULD GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE HERE

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:04.837
ON YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.473
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL HAS THREE

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.074
POINT FIVE BILLION FOR DIRECT

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.076
CARBON. DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:18.117
WE KNOW THAT- AS WE GO. I LOOK

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:19.652
FOR TO. THIS WERE GOING TO HAVE

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:21.553
A CAP TRADE THE WE LOOK AT WHAT

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.689
THE- IS FOR THAT. THAT REDUCTION

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.423
AND OUR STAFF REPORT INDICATES

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.325
IT'S IN THE FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.660
DOLLAR. LEVEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.894
IT'S ALMOST THAT'S- ALMOST THE

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.330
SIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR. NOW ROOFTOP

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.365
SOLAR IS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT JUST

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:36.235
KIDDING ALL KIDDING ASIDE- WITH

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.871
WITH THE- WITH THE NON

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:40.039
ATTAINMENT AREAS THAT WE HAVE

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.541
HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN. THE THREE

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.276
POINT FIVE. BILLION THAT'S

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.945
SITTING OUT THERE FOR THE- WHAT

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.480
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.316
THOUGH IT'S EXPENSIVE GIVEN

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:52.117
GIVEN SORT OF YOU KNOW.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:54.453
CALIFORNIA'S ALLEGED OUR

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.889
REPUTATION IS BEING A LEADER IN

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:57.890
TECHNOLOGY WOULDN'T THIS MAKES

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.425
SENSE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.093
DIRECT SOME OF THIS YEAR'S

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.194
BUDGET. TOWARDS MAKING THAT A

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.263
REALITY AT LEAST IN ONE OF THESE

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.664
NON ATTAINMENT AREAS I DON'T

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.965
KNOW WHO'S THE LUCKY LOTTO

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.667
WINNER WHETHER IT'S LA AND SOUTH

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.169
COASTERS SAN JOAQUIN OR WHOEVER

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.004
GETS THE DIRECT CAPTURE BIRD.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.340
ISN'T DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE JUST

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.841
A THEORETICAL LEVEL THAT WE

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.110
WOULD PUT MONEY IN TO MAKE SURE

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.611
THAT WE GET ONE OF THESE

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.547
PROJECTS IN THE WORST OF THE

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.515
WORST PLACES THAT HAVE- YOU

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:29.888
KNOW- CO TWO PROBLEM. I THINK

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.257
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:35.627
LEVERAGE- FEDERAL FUNDING IS- IS

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.363
ONE OF A KIND OF- THANK A

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:38.664
TRACTIVE GOT AWAY DISPLACING

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.432
THINK ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.633
STATE RESOURCES GIVEN SORT OF

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.035
THE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.436
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.537
AVAILABLE. OUT THERE AND SO AS

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:46.672
YOU MENTIONED THIS SORT OF

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.574
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE HOMES CULD

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.443
BE ONE OF THOSE- EXAMPLES I MEAN

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.512
I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.314
DON'T KNOW SORT OF ENOUGH ABOUT.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.482
EXACTLY WHAT THE DIRECTOR

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.751
CAPTURE HOMES WOULD LOOK LIKE-

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:01.053
BUT YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.820
THAT THEY WOULD FOCUS YOU KNOW

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:05.724
THAT THAT THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.960
FOCUSES. ON A CARBON I THINK I'M

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.195
TAKING CARBON OUT OF THE AIR-

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:10.829
AND SO THAT THAT'S REALLY THE-

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:12.398
GOAL LESS I'M GONNA BE- LOCAL

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.767
AIRPORT. SIDE OF THINGS AND SO.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.301
NOW WITH WITH HIS LEGISLATIVE

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.436
DECISIONS AROUND HOW HOW TO

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:18.404
ALLOCATE RESOURCES THERE ARE

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.572
ALWAYS KIND OF A VARIETY OF

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.540
COMPETING PRIORITIES AND THINGS

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.442
TO THINK ABOUT AND WHERE TO.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.077
WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS BUT

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:26.011
CERTAINLY. THINKING ABOUT WAYS

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.880
TO USE STATE FUNDING TO THE KIND

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.448
OF LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING TO

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:30.916
HELP ACHIEVE ITS ITS CLIMATE

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.885
GOALS AS ONE WOULD THINK

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:33.652
IMPORTANT. FACTOR TO CONSIDER

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.254
WHEN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS I

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.389
THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT TO

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:37.923
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE AIR

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.691
QUALITY DISCUSSIONS ROUNDS OUT.

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.527
THE THAT THE CARBON DISCUSSION

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.962
PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY WANT TO

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.664
HAVE THEIR AIR QUALITY WHICH IS

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.166
IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING BUT- AS

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:50.369
THE- AS THE- STAFF ANALYSIS IN

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.304
THE STEP ANALYSIS IN THE IN. THE

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.506
THAT THE NEXT. ISSUE NUMBER TO

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.774
TALK ABOUT IS THAT THAT. THAT

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.043
CARBON GOES. IS AROUND THE

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.180
WORLD- AND IN YOUR IN OUR LOCAL

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.548
NEIGHBORHOOD. ALL RIGHT. DON'T

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:04.917
GO AWAY WE HAVE SOME. HINTS HERE

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:05.684
AND I'M- SURE MY COLLEAGUES

TWENTY- THAT ZERO CARBON NUMBER

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.792
FLUCTUATES A LITTLE BIT

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.895
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH- HYDRO AND

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:24.997
A LEADING WE HAVE. IT IF YOU

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:26.265
THESE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.633
PLANNING SYSTEM PLAN IS

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:30.269
ACTUALIZED WILL BE APPROXIMATELY

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.538
THAT SEVENTY THREE PERCENT- THE

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:34.473
NEW WILL AND EIGHTY SIX PERCENT.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.776
GHG FREE RESOURCE THAT'S BY

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.944
TWENTY THIRTY TO. CALIFORNIA WAS

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.846
ALSO THE NATIONAL LEADER IN THE

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:41.980
INSTALLATION OF BATTERY STORAGE

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.782
LAST YEAR OVER TWO THOUSAND

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.018
MEGAWATTS OF NEW BATTERY STORAGE

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.252
INSTALLED IN CASE THE TERRITORY

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.688
. EXPECTED TO REACH NEARLY FORTY

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:50.756
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE BY

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.258
THE END OF THIS SUMMER- AND THIS

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:55.027
IS FROM NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.828
MEGAWATTS TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:58.730
SO COULD HAVE BEEN INCREMENTAL-

00:19:58.797 --> 00:19:59.798
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DEPLOYMENT

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.668
OF STORAGE OVER THE LAST TWO AND

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:03.569
HALF. YEARS WELL THE PROGRESS

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:04.970
TOWARD CLEAN ENERGY HAS BEEN

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.838
UNPRECEDENTED OVER THE PAST FEW

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.407
YEARS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.442
CHANGE FUND. TICKER LIABILITY

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:13.245
HAS COME TO PORTLAND. I THINK

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.479
THE OTHER JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.647
. AS CLIMATE CHANGE HAS LED TO

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.583
MORE EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT AND

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.351
WILDFIRES AT THE SAME TIME WE

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.286
BEGIN TRANSITIONING AWAY. FROM

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.121
THE AGING WANTS TO CLEAN UNITS

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:24.690
AND BRINGING UNPRECEDENTED

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.592
LEVELS OF CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES.

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:28.093
INSURANCE LIABILITY HAS BEEN

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.462
VERY CHALLENGING IS EXPECTED TO

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:33.398
BE SELF. IN ADDITION WHILE WE'RE

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:34.633
MAKING PROGRESS ON AUTHORIZING

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.835
CLEAN ENERGY PROCUREMENT. THE

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.304
CHALLENGES ARE CURRENTLY WITH IT

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.373
SO IF YOU DEPLOYMENT OF THE

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.708
COMMUNITY RESOURCES. SOME OF THE

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:45.277
CHALLENGES INCLUDE APPLY CHANGE

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:46.945
PERMITTING AND INTERCONNECTION

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.814
DELAYS TO NAME A FEW. THE SHEER

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.749
SCALE OF DEPLOYMENT- THAT WE'RE

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.919
TALKING ABOUT OVER THE NEXT

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.721
TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE MOVED TO

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.489
ADDRESS THE ONE HUNDRED TARGETS-

00:20:57.556 --> 00:21:00.325
THE 100% RETAIL SALES APPLIED BY

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.327
THE NEW POLITICAL RESOURCES BY

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.929
TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THERE ARE A

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.631
FEW CRITICAL TEAMS THAT WE ARE

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:07.099
WORKING TOWARDS. ALL THE

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.501
AGENCIES COORDINATED KERR AT

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:13.538
CPUC CC ALONG WITH- COORDINATION

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.707
AND CONSULTATION HI SO AS WELL

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.075
AS OTHER BALANCING AUTHORITIES

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:20.178
AND- IN THE STATE AND THOSE ARE.

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.680
THE SCALE OF THE RESOURCE BUILD

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:22.881
AND DEPLETED WHICH WE MUST

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.483
EQUALITY SOCIAL A CRITICAL THING

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.385
TO PAY ATTENTION TO. ALONG WITH

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:27.719
THAT IS AFFORDABILITY

USE TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT YES IT IS

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:48.466
THE WILL USE TECHNOLOGY AND- IT

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:51.236
IT ALLOWS SEQUESTRATION OF THE

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:25.330
UNITS WHICH IS THE BOX THAT WILL

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.764
PROBABLY END. BUT YOU KNOW AND

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.600
YOU IN CALIFORNIA SINCE YOU KNOW

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:33.104
OUR GOAL IS TO- YOU KNOW.

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.206
DECARBONISE ARE THE TRILLION

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:38.576
INDUSTRY IT'S NOT IN AN AREA OF

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:40.578
FOCUS HERE RIGHT. AND I THINK

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.413
YOU KNOW IN ADDITION YOU KNOW

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.649
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:45.817
THESE PROJECTS WE'RE ALSO

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:48.019
LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY IMPACT

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:51.256
WELL TO. AND AS THE VICE CHAIR-

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:54.125
MENTIONED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:56.194
AREAS IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:02.767
KNOW WE LISTEN TO OUR- UNITY- IN

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:06.538
MANY- NO MORE PROJECTS OR LOOK

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:09.440
IN LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:12.744
AND- PENSION WAITING THEY'LL

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.014
CONTINUE TO USE. OF COLIN AND

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.050
THERE IS COULD CAUSE- YOU KNOW

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:23.354
IN OUR MIDDLE. IF AND HEART TO

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.990
THEIR COMMUNITIES. YES MEAN I

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.825
KNOW THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.360
TARGET AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:30.495
THINGS OUR STAFF REPORT TALKS

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.596
ABOUT IS THE PERMIT PERMITTING

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.499
THAT TAKES FIVE TO SIX YEARS SO

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:35.433
WE'LL GET TO THAT. BUT

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.970
CONCEIVABLY- IF YOU IF THERE WAS

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.805
ENHANCE OIL RECOVERY AND THERE

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.340
WAS AN IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.676
CARPET IN THOSE AEAS THAT WERE.

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.311
THAT WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.845
THEY CAN OPERATE FOR. TWENTY

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:49.681
YEARS AND PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.983
BENEFITS I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY I

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:52.984
GET THE CRITICISM THAT LOOK

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.688
MIGHT PROLONG. THE ASSETS OF THE

00:30:56.754 --> 00:30:59.657
OF THE- REFINERY ORDER I MEAN OF

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:01.826
EXTRACTION BUT FROM A SCIENCE

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.861
POINT OF VIEW YOU DON'T DISPUTE

00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:05.129
THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS CARBON

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.931
THAT WILL BE MADE AT. FROM THOSE

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:10.301
FACILITIES RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:11.502
THAT'S NOT. WE AGREE ON THAT

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:15.373
RIGHT. WELL I MEAN I THINK IF

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.245
YOU REQUESTED THE CARBON- THEN

00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:21.980
THERE WOULD BE- YOU KNOW LET

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.549
THE- TO BEING PUT OUT INTO THE-

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:27.185
THE ATMOSPHERE BUT I THINK HE

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:28.519
REALLY. NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.521
THE ENVIRONMENTAL YOU KNOW

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:32.590
IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL YOU KNOW

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:35.426
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL TO.

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.895
SURE OKAY SO LET'S THAT THE

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:40.565
ADMINISTRATION HAS COME UP WITH

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.700
A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD. ELIMINATE

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.869
OR TAKE OUT THE IDEA OF A

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:47.105
SEQUESTERING THE CARBON IN A IN

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:49.574
A GEOLOGICAL STORAGE CAN YOU

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.943
HIGHLIGHT TEST THE AND THIS

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.712
WOULD INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL OR BIO

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.848
GAS OR ANY OTHER ANY OTHER

00:31:56.914 --> 00:32:00.652
APPLICATION EVEN WHEN IT WAS. S.

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.987
C. LIVERMORE LAB REPORT POINTS

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:05.490
OUT CONVENIENTLY LOCATED RIGHT

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:08.092
NEXT TO WHERE THE FACILITY YES

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:11.062
CAN YOU EXPLAIN OR AT EDUCATE ME

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:13.765
ON THAT. WELL I THINK THE MAIN

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:16.567
REASON WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:20.204
UTILIZATION. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:22.040
THINGS THAT- YOU MENTIONED- IS

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.409
THE LONG PERMITTING HI TO GET

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:27.445
THESE PROJECTS- SIDE. AND SO ARE

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.581
FUNDING HAS A LIMITED-

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.383
ENCUMBRANCES LIQUIDATION DATE.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.385
AND NO WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.688
SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW WE

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.956
WOULD BE STARTING A PROJECT AND

00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:40.725
NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.828
PROJECT WITHIN OUR- LIQUIDATION

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:47.699
PERIOD. AND SO- YOU KNOW IT IS

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.000
THE PROJECT OF THE PERMITTING

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:51.803
PROCESS TAKES FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.504
THERE ARE FUNDS LIQUIDATE AND

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.507
YOU KNOW FIGURE FOR WE NEVER GET

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:57.942
TO THAT SECOND POINT AND THAT'S

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.911
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.245
WHY YOU KNOW WE WERE FOCUSING ON

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:03.314
UTILIZATION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.650
LIKE THE ENDPOINT OF THE LOCK

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.185
CULTURALLY BE ABLE CAN'T

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.253
CONSULT. WITH THE TIME FRAME

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.055
THAT ARE FUNDING YEAH YEAH IT'S

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.623
SOME IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.192
THAT CALIFORNIA'S PRETTY PROUD

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.793
OF THAT IT TAKES FIVE TO SIX

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.963
YEARS SAID TO- SITE ANYTHING AND

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.965
WE'VE GOT AN ALPHABET SOUP OF.

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.635
OF PEOPLE THAT OUR AGENCIES THAT

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.337
HAVE JURISDICTION I MEAN IT'S

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.873
OUR STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT THAT

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.841
THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:31.542
RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIVITIES

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:33.644
RELATING TO THE STATE'S ENERGY

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:35.580
POLICY AND PLANNING. INCLUDING

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:38.149

CAPACITY OF FIFTY MEGAWATTS OR

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:48.693
MORE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.696
A- A THERMAL POWER PLANT THAT'S

00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:53.765

LOT OF BIOMASS THAT'S NOW USED

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.733
IN AGRICULTURE THAT'S BEING

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.368
BURNED WE NOW KNOW WE'VE TAKEN

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:20.871
STEPS TO LIMIT THAT. WE HAVE A

BOATLOAD OF BIOMASS THAT SITTING

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:25.242

pOPTIONS BUT BUT- CITING THE

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.158
BIOMASS FACILITIES IS AN

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.194
IMPORTANT. ELEMENT FOR US

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.395
FIGHTING THIS OTHER CLIMATE

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:46.097
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE OF THESE

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:49.533
ENORMOUS FIRES THAT WE HAVE- SO

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.901
WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS THAT

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.671
YOU HAVE ON CITING BIOMASS IS IT

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:57.608
THE SAME FIFTY. MEGAWATTS YEAH

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.043
THE COMMISSION'S EXCLUSIVE

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.645
JURISDICTION FOR ANY THURMOND

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:01.879
OUR PLAN STARTS AT FIFTY

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.748
MEGAWATTS OKAY NOW IS THERE

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.216
ANYTHING MAGIC ABOUT FIFTY

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:07.518
MEGABYTES IF WE IF WE CHANGE

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:08.886
THAT TO A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WE

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:12.723
ARE THE LEGISLATURE OR HUNDRED

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.558
FIFTY MEGAWATTS ARE WE GOING TO

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.460
. NOT ALLOW I GUESS THAT WOULD

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.095
TAKE THE ENERGY COMMISSION OUT

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:20.264
YOU STILL HAVE THE LOCAL AIR

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:23.834
BOARD AND- THIRD THE REGIONAL-

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.670
THE FOLKS THERE WHAT BENEFIT

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:28.305
WOULD THAT. IN YOUR MIND WITH

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.775
THAT CREATE. IF YOU WERE TO

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.811
RAISE THE LIMIT SO THAT THAT TWO

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:34.812
HUNDRED I ALSO THAT WHILE

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.247
THEY'RE THERE ALREADY IS AN EXAM

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:37.915
THERE'S A SMALL POWER PLANT

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.918
EXTENSION- WHICH IS- ANY POWER

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.920
PLANT UP TO NOT EXCEEDING A

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.123
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS- NOT EXCEEDING

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.458
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS CAN APPLY FOR

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:48.993
A SMALL POWER PLANT EXEMPTION

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.327
AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.495
THAT CASE IT WOULD GET AS

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:53.898
PERMITS FROM- THE LOCAL

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.232
GOVERNMENTS SO THAT. THE ENERGY

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:58.502
COMMISSION WOULD DO THE SEQUOIA-

00:38:58.569 --> 00:38:59.837
ANALYSIS CALIFORNIA POLY ACT

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:04.308
ANALYSIS- AND THEN IT IF IT WERE

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.576
EXEMPTED- THE FINE IS GOING TO

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.078
MANDATE WOULD BE HANDED BACK TO

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:07.611
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.947
PERMITTING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.216
MAKES IT ANY QUICKER- BECAUSE

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:13.484
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO GET THEIR

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.885
PERMITS FROM ANY OTHER AGENCIES

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.954
AS THEY STUCK WITH THE ENERGY

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:17.855
COMMISSION THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.191
CERTIFICATE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:22.893
LIEU OF THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.029
FROM THAT. SO MAY YOU CAN HELP

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:27.064
ME ON THAT THIS SITE. SET SO

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:27.598
LET'S SEE YOU HAVE A HIGH

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:28.799
MEGAWATTS. BIOMASS AND IT IS

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:31.936
LOCATED NEXT DOOR TO A

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:35.606
GEOLOGICAL. GOD CAVITY OR

00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:37.308
STORAGE FACILITY THAT EVERYBODY

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.677
IN THE WORLD AGREES IS AYE DELEK

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:41.579
FOR STORING CARBON. AND UNDER

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.848
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT SAYS

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.050
WE CAN'T DO THAT THAT THAT'S NOT

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.585
AN ELIGIBLE SO THAT MEANS THAT

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.286
THAT AND LET'S SEE THE OPERATOR

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.621
WANTS TO DO IT THEY WANT TO PUT

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:53.390
IN THEIR OWN MONEY THEY WANT TO.

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:55.192
TAKE SOME OF THE FEDERAL MONEY.

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.093
WHY IS THAT A BAD IDEA. WHAT'S

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.696
THE WHAT'S THE POLICY REASON

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:01.732
FROM THE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:04.335
. THAT'S REALLY NOT A QUESTION

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:06.771
FOR ME TO ANSWER- I DON'T KNOW

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.874
OF ANYBODY ELSE THE COMMISSION.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.609
FOR THE REST OF US THAT'S REALLY

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:13.410
OUTSIDE MY AREA OF EXPERTISE

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.845
OKAY THANK IS BECAUSE YOUR SITE

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.580
YOUR THE SITE THIS IS WHERE IT

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.516
CITED RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS WHAT

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:19.650
THEY WANTED TO. YEAH I WOULD

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.519
JUST I WOULD GUESS A FROM A

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:23.287
CITING PERSPECTIVE I MEAN FROM A

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:23.854
LICENSING PERSPECTIVE IT'S

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.522
INFOPRINT EVAN APPLICANT

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.857
PROPOSED SUCH A- A PROJECT WITH

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.026
CARBON CAPTURE IS A PART OF THE

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:31.228
PROJECT IT WOULD LIKELY BE-

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:31.996
WHAT'S CALLED A RELATED

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:33.330
DISABILITY AND FALL INTO THE

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:35.099
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AUTHORITY.

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.801
TO PERMIT IT- IT'S IT SOUNDS

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.369
LIKE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING ES

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.805
DE- AN ELEMENT OF THE PROJECT IS

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.473
DEDICATED TO AN ESSENTIAL TO THE

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.308
FUNCTION OF THE POWER PLANTS

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.776
THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THE ENERGY

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:46.443
COMMISSION IS EXCLUSIVE

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.712
JURISDICTION THE SITE THE

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:52.683
ENTIRETY OF THE FACILITY

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:57.354
ALLENTOWN IS. SENATE ALL YOU

RECOGNIZE THANK YOU FOR SHARING-

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:04.161
SO. I GUESS HE WAS REGION IT WAS

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:06.697
TALKING ABOUT THE- CAPTURE THE

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.265
FACILITIES THEN AND WE BASICALLY

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:10.968
OF EXCLUDED. OIL AND GAS FOR

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.870
CAPTURE IS WHAT WHAT- I HEARD

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:14.839
YOU SAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.808
A GOAL OF THE- INSPIRATIONS I

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:21.345
BELIEVE- SO I WANT TO JUST GIVE

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:21.846
SENSE OF. ADDICTIVE THE

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.014
FRUSTRATION FOR MOST OF. THE

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:26.250
MEMBERS HERE IS THAT. THERE IS

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:30.287
NO LONG TERM GOAL OF- BUT PUTS A

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.589
LOT WHAT'S THE PLAN WHAT'S THE

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.891
REAL PLAN HERE WE WERE FOCUSING

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.760
ON. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:39.496
AND IF WE CAN'T. THE CARBON IF

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.398
WE CAN'T CAPTURE THE CARBON AND

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:42.666
GENERATE ELECTRICITY AT THE SAME

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.635
TIME- BUT MAKING THE

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:47.238
ENVIRONMENT. OF BEING PROPER IN

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.740
THAT IN THAT ONE LOCATION WHAT

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.442
IS A LONG TERM GOAL I MEAN I

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:53.377
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE- PUT ANY

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:55.379
GASOLINE IN YOUR CAR OR PAGE

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.848
ELECTRIC BILL LATELY BUT IT'S-

00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:00.117
IS EXTREMELY HIGH IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:03.187
EXTREMELY HIGH. SIX FORTY FIVE A

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:04.989
GALLON OF GAS THIS MORNING. AND

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.791
ARE WE PAY 60% HIGHER ELECTRIC

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:10.227
RATES. THAN THE AVERAGE IN THE

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:12.830
NATON. AND CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.965
LEADING THE LEAGUE IN THE STATE.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.734
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LEADING

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.704
IN THE AREA OF THE ENVIRONMENT

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:24.041
AND- I'M NOT SURE WE'RE REALLY

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:26.310
DOING THAT I THINK WE'RE JUST

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:29.246
pI GUESS THAT REDUCES YOUR CARBON

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:29.847
FOOTPRINT IF THEY GO SOMEWHERE

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:32.883
ELSE. BUT WHAT IS THE LONG TERM

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.052
PLAN FOR NOT GOING TO FOCUS ON

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:35.753
CAPTURING CARBON IN A SAFE

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.521
MANNER IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.823
THESE PLANTS ARE SITED-

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.994
INTRODUCE- YOU KNOW OIL AND GAS

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.896
FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE USING

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:48.165
THAT IN THE IN THE NEXT FEW

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:52.503
YEARS BEFORE WE GET TO. A SYSTEM

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.371
WHERE WE HAVE ELECT EVEY CARS

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:57.942
ARE- INTERGRADES MARKETS ALREADY

00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:58.943
SHE WITH THAT WAS ARTICLE

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.711
YESTERDAY THEY CAME OUT THEY

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.613
SAID WE COULD HAVE ROLLING

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.083
BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER. NOW IF

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.617
WE'RE GONNA HAVE ROLLING

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:07.818
BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER MAY WE

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:09.787
OUGHT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.588
WE CAN AVOID THAT SO

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:12.589
CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT IN THE

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.858
DARK. SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:17.127
IS THE LONG TERM PLAN. YOU'RE

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:19.163
JUST FOCUSING ON GASOLINE IN

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.931
YOUR FOCUS ON NOT ALLOWING US TO

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:22.633
CAPTURE CAPTURE CARBON. AT THE

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:29.940
SITE. WERE PRODUCING ELECTRICITY. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:33.110
QUESTION AND- I JUST WANTED A

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.578
BIGGER- DISCUSSION ON THIS ONE

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.380
AND PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUES TO

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.915
GET ONE I NEED ANYMORE

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.817
INFORMATION. I JUST AT A HIGH

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:40.584
LEVEL I THINK THE POINT YOU

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.419
JUST. MADE AN EXTREMELY

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.755
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.256
AS YOU MENTIONED AT A LIABILITY

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:49.026
THAT IMPORTANT FOCUS AND I THINK

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:49.893
YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.763
WE ARE COMMITMENTS EACH AND THAT

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.099
AS WE LOOK THROUGH THE ENERGY

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.734
TRANSITION. AND MOVING FORWARD

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.202
OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.170
WE THE COOKING NICE AND THE

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:02.072
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OPTIONS ON THE

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.641
TABLE AND AS WE- INDICATED

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:08.212
EARLIER. AND WE SEE THAT LITTLE

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:10.881
DOG TURMEL- GENERATION IS THE

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.583
CHOIR BASED ON THE CURRENT

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:14.351
MODELING TODAY AND THE STATE OF

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.320
TECHNOLOGY FROM THE COST. AS

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:18.822
LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.191
THERMAL ENERGY FOR OUR PERSONAL.

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.293
GENERATIONS WE WOULD BENEFIT

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.896
FROM YES. I THINK THAT THE

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:28.032
EXACT- THAT KIND OF POINT OF

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.800
SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS WHICH WE

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.369
ARE STILL THINKING THROUGH IS TO

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:33.937
THE EXTENT THAT CCS IS AN

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.939
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE ENERGY

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:38.442
TRANSITION. WHERE AND HOW WE

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.277
CITED AND IT'S- IT'S SOMETHING

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:43.280
THAT WE ARE TACKLING- IN OUR

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:44.515
HYPER THIS YAR WITH BEGINNING

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.283
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.584
I THINK AND THE PRINCIPLE

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.953
LEVELS- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:59.063
OPTIONS THAT IMPORTANT. AS. WE

00:44:59.129 --> 00:44:59.630
MOVE FORWARD IN THE ENERGY

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:00.564
TRANSITION. SO- A UP QUESTION

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.200
THAT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW IT WE'RE

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:04.401
TALKING ABOUT. CARBON IN THAT

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:06.437
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.704
TALK ABOUT THE EMISSIONS OF

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.273
FORCE BY WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.308
GONNA BE ABLE TO CAPTURE- WHEN

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.477
IT'S ON FIRE BUT WE CAN CAPTURE

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.913
IT- JUST AS THE CHAIRMAN- TALKED

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:19.683
ABOUT IN BIOMASS BEFORE- IT GOES

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.219
UP IN IN FLAMES AND IT'S

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:24.254
ACTUALLY WHILE PART IN IN LAST

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:27.591
YEAR. THE DIXIE FIRE WHICH WAS

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:30.194
ALL IN MY DISTRICT. AND ALSO THE

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.895
CALDOR BAR WHICH WAS ALL IN MY

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:35.532
DISTRICT- DESTROYED ALMOST A

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.801
MILLION ACRES ONE FIRE. AND IF

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.203
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OUTPUT

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.305
OF CARBON FOR CALIFORNIANS

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.607
WHICH- WE NEED TO COUNT WE DON'T

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:44.808
COUNT THAT AS OUR AS OUR

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.344
EMISSIONS EVEN THOUGH WE COULD.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.613
CAPTURE THAT CARBON CREATE GREEN

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.815
ENERGY AND PUT IT IN A BIOMASS

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.217
PLANT INSIDE AND THROUGHOUT THIS

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:55.185
YEAR IS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.387
AND THE TRINITY'S WE'RE MY

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:58.088
COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:00.057
DISTRICT IS THAT- TO ALLEVIATE

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:02.126
THOSE EMISSIONS PRIOR TO A

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:04.595
CATASTROPHIC FIRE SO WHAT'S THE

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:08.966
WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THAT. YEAH-

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:12.102
SO TO THE EXTENT THE SB ONE

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:12.736
HUNDRED MODELING AND I JUST WANT

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:15.472
TO TAKE IT. AGAIN JUST AT A HIGH

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.241
LEVEL FIRST AND THEN TRY TO SEE

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:18.342
IF WE COULD. ADD ANY MORE

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:19.877
DETAILS. SO WHEN WE STARTED

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:21.778
DOING THAT AT THE ONE HUNDRED

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:24.982
AND OUT OF SAYS. SB ONE ANALYSIS

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:25.582
I DO THINK ABOUT THE- ENERGY

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:28.118
TRANSITION. EVERYTHING THAT IS

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.720
ELIGIBLE IN THE R. P. S. IS

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:32.322
ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE.

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.958
ALONG WITH. ON SITE RESOURCES

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.693
ARE DUE TO CARMEN SO BETWEEN

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.596
THAT CONTEXT- WE DID MODEL AND

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:42.232
IN THE BYE BY MASS. AND BY

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:44.034
BUDGET. IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR PS

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:46.837
AND IT'S STILL. A PART OF OUR

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.772
MODELING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.240
I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD THE

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.409
CHAIR I MENTION THIS THIS COMMON

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.478
I THINK THERE ARE A BAD IDEA A

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:55.946
PRICE HAVE PULLING TOGETHER. IN

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:57.381
TERMS OF BOTH THE CLIMATE

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.749
CHALLENGES. BUT A LIABILITY THE

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:01.251
AFFORDABILITY- AND DIFFERENT

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.719
ASPECTS OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.521
DECARBONISATION CLIMATE GOALS

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.923
AND I THINK AS WE LOOK THROUGH

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.691
THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ABOUT

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:10.160
IDEA SCENARIOS. AND ARRIVING AT

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.529
SOLUTIONS THAT- THAT KIND OF

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:14.665
CONNECT THE DOTS ON WE JUST

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:15.832
ABOUT IT BEING MENTIONED TODAY

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:25.642
AND EXPECT. TO ADDRESS MOST OF

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:26.810
THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:27.744
TODAY. TRY LAST. DOES THAT THE

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.946
COMMISSION OR THE

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.414
ADMINISTRATION. LOOK INTO THE

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.684
FOR THAT. WE IMPORT ENERGY FROM

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.920
OTHER COUNTRIES. SUCH AS ECUADOR

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.956
WHERE WE'RE BRINGING IN 24% OF

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.757
OUR CRUDE OIL RIGHT NOW FROM

00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.459
ECUADOR WHICH HAS NO REGULATIONS

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.328
AND IS DESTROYING THE AMAZON

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:46.763
RAINFOREST AT THE SAME TIME

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:51.435
PUTTING. OIL IN A SHIP AND IN.

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.502

WHICH IS A MISSION FOR OUR

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.875
CONSTITUENTS WHO LIVE IN IN SAN

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:01.144
DIEGO AREA FOR SURE WE KNOW THAT

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.846
THERE'S- WHAT IS THE PLAN TO

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.382
LIKE. REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.952
AT THE OVERALL CARBON OUTPUT.

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.888
WHEN WE IMPORT VERSUS WHETHER

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:16.393
PRODUCING THOSE- THAT ENERGY FOR

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.294
CALIFORNIANS RIGHT HERE IN

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.830

THIS HAS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE-

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.875
DECARBONISING LOOK AT AN ECONOMY

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:33.644
LEVEL AND IN A CARD HAS BEEN

BUNCH OF STATE AGENCIES THAT

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.818
WILL BETTER EXPANDABLE IN THE

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:43.287
TRANSPORTATION SIDE AS WELL AS

LOOKING FORWARD TO. ABOUT I WILL

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.429
A BLUEPRINT. COMING TOGETHER

TEN YEARS WHERE MY OR LONGER.

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.348
WHEN WITHOUT AND WHEN WILL THERE

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.683
BE A PLAN AVAILABLE FOR THE

THE LONG TERM EFFECTS AND THE

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.022
SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF IMPORTING

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:22.259
VERSES CREATING- OUR ENERGY HERE

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:26.129
AT HOME. IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:28.865
FIRST ON THAT- HIGH LEVEL AND

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:30.767
ISSUE OF THE CARDS REPORT I

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.436
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE COMING

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:35.205
OUT WITHIN THIS MONTH AS PART OF

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:37.174
THE UNDERSTAND. I'M AS FAR AS

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:37.808
THEIR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:40.377

WE WILL CIRCLE BACK. WITH THE

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.350
CARD THAT'S THE ONE THEY HAVE

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.552
AND WE WILL AND IT COME BACK TO

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:51.154
YOU WITH MORE THAN SIX SO I HAVE

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.956
ONE SO WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:54.324
NOT PERMITTING WELLS IN

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:56.360
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THERE'S A

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:57.594
THOUSAND WELLS AT CAL JIM. AND

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:01.865
THEY'RE NOT GETTING PERMITTED

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:02.532
AND WE'RE IMPORTING OIL FROM. WE

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:05.068
WORK FROM RUSSIA. WE WERE WE ARE

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:07.771
FROM ECUADOR WHY WOULD WE NOT

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.506
MAKE CALIFORNIA IN IT WHERE WE

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:12.376
DO IT CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:14.344
WE PUT CALIFORNIA PEOPLE TO WORK

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.879
ON OF COMMODITY THAT WE KNOW

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.848
WE'RE GOING TO USE WE USE ONE

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.883
POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.986
OIL A DAY. I LOOK I'M FORGETTING

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.821
IS TO ELECT DOCTORATE EV'S BUT

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.289
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEIR

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.691
PERCENT ANYTIME SOON BECAUSE OUR

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:31.261
GRIT IS NOT EVEN AND SHAPE. TO

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:31.995
PUT OUT THE ELECTRICITY THAT WE

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:34.831
NEED SO. SO WHAT WHERE IS IT

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:38.468
WHERE IS THAT. KNOWLEDGE IS.

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.537
WHAT ARE WE NOT WHY ARE WE NOT

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.638
PRODUCING OIL IN CALIFORNIA

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:42.873
THAT'S MY QUESTION AND WHY ARE

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.708
WE DESTROYING THE RAINFOREST.

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:47.144
ANTS IN DOING A VICTORY LAP IN

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.011
CALIFORNIA SAYING WE'RE HELPING

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.647
THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE NOT. I

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.315
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTOOD.

00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:53.550
SOMETHING THAT AT THE ENERGY

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.919
COMMISSION. DOESN'T DIRECTLY

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:58.789
WORK IN- YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.490
COORDINATING IT SPONSORS TO YOU

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.125
ABOUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING.

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:04.594
THAT FIFTY. PEOPLE TO PROVIDE

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.396
INFORMATION ON. WHAT WE COULD

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.597
CAPTURE THIS IS ABOUT CARBON

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:08.799
CAPTURE WE COULD BE CAPTURING

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.635
OIL. ARE WE COULD BE CATCHING

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:12.436
CARBON AT OIL WELLS AND

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:13.970
PRODUCING WELL CALIFORNIA CLEAN

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:16.239
IN A CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:16.873
MANNER THAT'S THE QUESTION. WHY

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.678
WHY. I BELIEVE IT THERE IS A

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:24.848
RHETORICAL QUESTION- I'VE A

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.616
COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS BECAUSE WE

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:27.918
DID HEAR TESTIMONY THAT THERE

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:30.153
ARE CURRENTLY NO OPERATIONAL-

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.055
CCS PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:33.457
HOWEVER THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.959
PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND THAT

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.861
FOR- THEY ENERGY COMMISSION HOW

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.162
MANY FACILITIES HAVE TAKEN

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:57.474
IT'S- PRESENTLY MAKING ITS WAY

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:59.075
THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S-

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:00.877
PROCESS AND RECORDING WITH LOOK

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.780
WHAT THE BAY AREA A KID ON THE-

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.482
ON THE PERMITTING FOR THE- FOR

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:07.717
THE ACTIVITIES. SO I GUESS THE

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.386
QUESTION IS THIS WHAT POINT

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:11.821
SOURCES IN THE ENERGY SECTOR OF

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:13.957
THE GREATEST GREENHOUSE GAS

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.159
EMITTERS AND IS IT CURRENTLY

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.961
COST EFFECTIVE- FOR THESE

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:24.434
FACILITIES TO ADAPT AT CCS.

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:29.072
RIGHT IS IT. YEP THE BIGGEST

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:31.708
CENTIMETERS. THAT WE HAVE OUR-

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.577
GENERALLY IN THE OF THE OIL AND

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:36.446
GAS INDUSTRY. REFINING FOSSIL

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:38.315
FUEL ELECTRIC GENERATION

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.884
BUSINESS MANUFACTURING- NATURAL

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.220
GAS DISTRIBUTION AND OPTIONAL

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:47.057
COMBINING. AND THE COST OF

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:50.560
CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES-

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:53.096
RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.631
DOLLARS A METRIC TON DEPENDING

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:56.933
ON THE TYPE OF FACILITY YOU KNOW

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.438
SOME FACILITIES HAVE RELATIVELY-

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.306
NOT CONTAMINATED FIELDS WHO LIKE

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:05.442
A SMALL PRODUCTION SO THOSE

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:08.378
WOULD BE EASIER TO CAPTURE THE

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.915
FEEL TO THAN OTHERS THAT HAVE

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:14.551
OTHER CONTAMINANTS. AND SO MANY

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.687
OF THE CCS- ARE PLANNED IN

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.422
CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE A LOT

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:22.258
OF THEM ARE DOING- STUDIES AT

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.627
THIS POINT TO ANALYZE. YOU KNOW

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.862
THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS GO

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.331
GET JONES STUDIES AND FINANCIAL

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:30.634
DECISIONS SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.770
AN INITIAL STUDY AND THEN

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:34.604
THEY'RE DOING ADDITIONAL

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.239
FLOODING. YOUR BID FOR THE MAKE

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:39.009
THEIR- DECISION. AND SO I'M LIKE

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:41.177
ENERGY EFFICIENCY WHERE THERE'S

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:50.053
A FREEZING STREAM.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.288
THE FEDERAL CHIU FORTY FIVE

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:55.392
INCENTIVE PAYMENT. RIGHT I GUESS

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:56.626
I GUESS I THINK RIGHT NOW I'M

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.962
YEAH NO GO AHEAD I JUST I'M

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.230
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TO MAXIMIZE

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:02.332
CARBON CAPTURE IN THE COUNTRY IS

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:05.402
IT NECESSARY THAT. WE FACILITATE

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.270
THE ADOPTION AT THESE LARGE

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:09.172
POLLUTERS OR ARE THE SMALL

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.441
POINT- SOURCES OF VIABLE AND

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.510
COST EFFECTIVE TARGET FOR

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:17.847
CAPTURE. WELL I THINK IT'S CAN

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:20.550
ON THE LOCATION OF THE- AND THE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:24.821
DISTANCE TO THE WORKSITE- AND

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:27.223
THE- OVERALL POTENTIAL IMPACT

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:28.191
THAT IT COULD HAPPEN ENVIRONMENT

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:31.094
BOTH. SHE I THINK LOCAL

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:35.665
COMMUNITY YOU KNOW NEED TO.

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.434
GREAT DAY ARE ALSO VERY CHEAP IN

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.337
TO TURN THAT THE OF THE- THESE

00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:44.708
SYSTEM. OKAY ONE LAST QUESTION

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:47.010
AND THIS IS I MAY ASK THE ALEJO

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:49.079
THE STANFORD ENERGY FUTURES

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:52.348
INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY IN

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:53.583
THAILAND ACTION PLAN FOR CARBON

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.751
CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:55.518
CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.587
CHALLENGES THE SOLUTIONS REPORT

00:55:57.654 --> 00:56:00.190
STATES THAT CCS IS CURRENTLY NOT

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:02.025
INELIGIBLE PATHWAY UNDER THE CAP

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.293
AND TRADE PROGRAM WERE

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.994
RECOGNIZED IN THE MANDATORY

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:07.797
GREEN GAS REPORTING REGULATIONS

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.833
AS A RESULT COVERED ENTITIES

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.768
CANNOT UCCS TO REDUCE THE

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.470
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT'S

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.739
THE YEAR THEIR ANNUAL EMISSIONS

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.140
CAP. EVEN IF THEY CAPTURE AND

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.775
STORE THEIR EMISSIONS IN

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:22.078
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CCS PROTOCOL

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.514
SO IS THAT MISTER BROWN IS THAT

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:28.351
YOUR UNDERSTANDING- OF A OF THAT

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:30.553
AND HAVE YOU. IS THAT YOUR OF

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.322
THAT BIG CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:35.458
IN CCS. YES THAT'S OUR

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.328
UNDERSTANDING AND I GUESS- SOME

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:39.729
HAS FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.631
HAVE YOU'VE NOTED THISBEING A

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.334
BARRIER TO THE ADOPTION THE CCS

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.537
AT THERMAL POP UP POWER PLANTS I

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:48.705
MEAN IF THEY'RE NOT COVERED

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:51.674
UNDER. A I COULD GET A REDUCTION

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:54.177
IS THAT A BARRIER ON THE FOR

00:56:54.244 --> 00:57:03.353
THEM. BUT WHAT YOU KNOW WE ARE

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.088
BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.823
CAN YOU COME BACK. YEAH WELL

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.392
ALIGHT I THINK- MAYBE ERIC ALSO

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:13.329
HELP ON THIS I THINK IS ERICA.

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.398
THAT YOU KNOW THE CDC HAS

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:16.833
JURISDICTION ON OUR POWER PLANTS

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.136
OVER FIFTY MEGAWATT. AND IF THAT

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:23.306
PROJECT CAME IN AND HAD A CCS

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:24.707
COMPONENTS WITH THAT. THAT IT

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:25.975
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:28.578
ENERGY COMMISSION- TAKE A LOOK

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:32.015
AT AS WELL- BUT AT THIS POINT I

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.349
DON'T BELIEVE THERE HAD BEEN

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.685
ANY- PEARL HARBOR SENT OVER

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.453
FIFTY MEGAWATTS THAT HAVE COME

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:43.560
IN BUT- PCS. IN A DIFFERENT

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:45.461
LANGUAGE. I MEAN YOU COULD YOU

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:47.564
COULD SEE THE THREE MEN THERE

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.565
GOING TO GET ANY CREDIT FOR THAT

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.466
AND TRADE. AND THEY STILL TO

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.368
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE Q. PROGRAM

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:53.036
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS WITH

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:54.571
FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S OUT THERE

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:58.875
OR PERHAPS- ADVANCES THAT THE

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.009
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOUSE. AND

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:01.477
IT JUST SEEMS THAT FOR THE

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:05.248
PUBLIC THAT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:06.749
. I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:08.451
LESS CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.253
THESE POWER PLANTS THESE IN

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.555
THESE MATTERS. SO I'D LIKE FOR

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:16.226
YOU GUYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT-

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.894
THIS IS AN INFORMATION HEARING

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.530
SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S UP

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:23.933
EVERYBODY'S- PARTICIPATION. WE

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.501
HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FROM

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:28.571
CENTER DOLLY WHY DOES IT TAKE

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:30.840
TEN YEARS TO PERMIT WHAT WHAT'S

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:32.108
THE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:32.709
BOTTLENECK OR WHAT WHAT THAT

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:35.078
SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LONG TIME

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:39.415
TO. DO THE RIGHT THING. I THINK

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.918
THAT- THERE'S ALSO DISCOUNTS

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:44.320
DEPARTMENT QUALITY ACT AS WELL

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:48.791
AS LOCAL PERMITTING. AND-

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.194
ANNABEL YOU OFFICES MY

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:54.364
IMPRESSION IS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.432
GOING THROUGH THE PERMITTING

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:58.201
THERE'S MULTIPLE WHICH ALSO

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.370
GETTING THE WELL PERMITS FROM

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:03.840
THE EPA ON JAN YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.976
NO AGENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:08.311
THROUGH AND SHOW GOING THROUGH

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:11.614
THAT WHOLE PROCESS- TAKES TIME

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:14.350
NO I THINK ERIC TALKED ABOUT THE

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:15.818
CITING PROCESS AND YOU KNOW KIND

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.820
OF LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:19.022
YOU KNOW THE PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:20.990
LESS THAN FIFTY MEGAWATTS VERSUS

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.392
THOSE THAT ARE OLDER FIFTY

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:25.295
MEGAWATTS AND- YOU KNOW WHEN AND

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:27.764
IF HE HAS TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.499
AGENCIES TO GET APPROVAL. EACH

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:36.172
ONE OF THOSE COULD PAINT- HELLO

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:37.807
. AT WOULD SEEM TO ME THE IF.

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.342
THIS IS ACTUALLY DOING THE RIGHT

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.544
THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BY

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.279
CAPTURING CARBON. AND

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.848
SEQUESTERING IT THERE WOULD BE.

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:48.384
VERY LITTLE IMPACT. BECAUSE IT'S

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.886
ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE DIRECTION

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:54.524
OF DECARBONISATION. GOALS SO IT

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.092
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WOULD

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.461
TAKE TEN YEARS. IF IT IF THERE

00:59:58.528 --> 00:59:59.562
IS NO NEGATIVE IMPACT IS

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.731
ACTUALLY A POSITIVE TO GETTING

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:07.870
TO OUR- CLIMATE GOALS. M. ANIMAL

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.305
I BELIEVE IT THAT THANK YOU VERY

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:12.342
MUCH ENERGY COMMISSION AND ALEJO

OBVIOUSLY ALSO. I CAN JUST NOTE

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:16.892
SENATOR THAT THE STATE HAS HAD

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.662
SOME EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS WHERE-

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.297
THAT KIND OF PERCH WATER RIGHTS

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:24.066
IT'S BEEN PRETTY LIMITED- THERE

PROGRAM THAT THAT WHILE I'M-

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.675
WELL IF. BOARD RUNS ABOUT

WATER SO AS IS OUTLINED IN YOUR

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.480

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.815
WOULD BE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:40.883
PURCHASE WATER ALONG PRIORITIZE

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.451

BY PEOPLE IN THE AMOUNT OF WATER

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:06.976
THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE THEORY

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.478
IS THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD WANT

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.247

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.655
AND WE DON'T KNOW I DON'T I'M

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:21.423
NOT SPECULATING WITH THE PRICES

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.093
BUT THERE. THEY'RE WILLING TO

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.494
GIVE UP THEIR WATER RIGHTS WHICH

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:28.464
YOU CREATE AND THE STATE WITH

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.598
THE STATE WOULD PURCHASE THEM

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.600
AND BASICALLY BACK LIKE A BANK

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.269

PROBLEMS GETTING ALLOCATIONS

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.652
RIGHT- AT THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:52.821
THOSE AREAS TO SEE IF THERE WERE

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:55.224
ANY SELLERS. WOULD HAVE THAT AND

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:56.926

DEMAND OF WATER ANYWAY- BUT THE

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.215
PRIORITY WOULD BE ON

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.917
ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS AND SORT OF

SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:13.522
THEIR OWN MONEY. NOW THEY'RE

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.623

THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS A WHAT IS

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.678
YOURS ON HISTORY. AND WE DIDN'T

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.213
SAY THAT WATER LETTING IT OUT

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.855
IT. TO THE WE HAVE IT IN DROUGHT

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:47.723
YEARS. WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:50.058
CHANGE IN THIS BUILDING ALL THE

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:50.692
TIME CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT THE

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.628
SOLUTION. IS THE PROBLEM. WHY

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.196
DON'T WE TALK ABOUT. IT FOR.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.899
ABOUT STORING MORE WATER

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.367
CATCHING IT BECAUSE IT'S COMING

01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:00.335
UP EARLIER WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:00.869
THAT WE JUST TALK ABOUT

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.271
PENALIZING PEOPLE OR PAYING

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.672
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.240
MONEY IN CALIFORNIA JUST BUY

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.208
STUFF BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.843
ECONOMY DOESN'T HELP TO

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.510
COMMUNITIES AS DESTROYING

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:11.413
AGRICULTURE IN THE WAY OF LIFE

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.481
IN CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:15.417
SOME MONEY PUT IN THIS BUDGET TO

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:16.051
BUILD SITES RESERVOIR. NOBODY

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.786
DISPUTES THAT IT'S NOT. A GREAT

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:19.054
PROJECT. ENVIRONMENTALISTS LIKE

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:24.193
IT. LABOUR LIKES IT AG LIKES IT

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.361
THIS APOLOGIES LIKE IT AND WHAT

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:29.064
WE GETTING NOTHING NOT ONE RED

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.133
PENNY GOING TOWARDS RIDICULOUS

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.169
WHAT PERHAPS SENATOR IF YOU READ

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.871
THROUGH THE REST OF THE SENATE

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.506
PROPOSAL YOU WOULD NOTE THAT WE

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.508
HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.510
IMPROVE THE WATERSHED CLIMATE

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:42.945
RESILIENCY REGIONALLY THIS WOULD

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.913
IMPROVE THE WATERSHEDS THAT

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.216
WOULD ALLOW MORE WATER TO END UP

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:48.951
IN THE EXISTING DAMAGE THAT WE

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.652
HAVE DOESN'T INCREASE CAPACITY

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:53.055
BUT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:56.558
WATER IN THE IS PARTICULARLY IN

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:57.926
THE UPPER WATERSHED. THAT WILL

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.329
IMPROVE IT IN THE IN THE WHAT

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:01.463
YEARS THAT WOULD IMPROVE YOU YOU

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:04.500
HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME SOURCE. THE

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:05.767
SOURCE OF WHERE THE WATER'S

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.769
COMING FROM AS WELL AS THE ONE

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.571
POINT FIVE. BILLION TO IMPROVE

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.473
THAT SAFE DRINKING WATER SOME OF

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.075
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:15.677
WATERSHED WORK BECAUSE THAT THAT

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.479
WATER DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:20.182
AND LESS IT'S CLEAN FROM THE

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.750
REMNANTS OF THE FIRE OR THE

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.485
DESTRUCTION THIS OCCURRED. IN IN

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:25.487
YOUR DISTRICT AND SENATE MCGUIRE

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.356
SISTER WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.224
THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED SO

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.093
THAT'S THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.395
NECESSARY WORK THAT'S BEING DONE

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:35.297
IN YOURS IN SENATOR MCGUIRE'S

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.866
DISTRICTS LARGELY TO IMPROVE.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.635
THE DAMS THE OPERATION OF THE

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.536
DAMS IN THE WATER THAT'S

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:43.272
AVAILABLE AT THAT THOSE AT THOSE

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.574
FACILITIES TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:46.942
THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.377
THE DROUGHT THE DROUGHT

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.279
RESILIENT- GRANTS. TO ASSIST

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.114
WITH RESPECT WHICH IS DOWNSTREAM

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.815
WHICH MIGHT BE IN MY DISTRICT

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.017
WORK WHERE PEOPLE USE IT SO THAT

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:59.554
WE REDUCE THE STRESSORS ON ON.

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:02.190
ON THE- FACILITIES. SO THERE

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.592
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.994
THERE ARE THERE'S THINGS IN

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.263
THERE AND- WE'LL SEE WHO'S RIGHT

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.499

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.167
WE'LL SEE WHO COMES FOR BECAUSE

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.602
I THINK YOUR OBSERVATIONS ARE

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:16.338
THAT THERE'S SOME. THE DAMAGE

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.207
HAS ALREADY OCCURRED TO MEMBERS

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.175
AND THE AGRICULTURE COMMISSION.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:23.412
OR COMMUNITY THEY THEY THEY THE

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.247
PICTURE THAT YOU'VE PAINTED IS

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:27.316
ALREADY IT OCURRED OCCURRED

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:28.583
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT THEY CAN

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.452
THEY CAN- RENDER BUSINESS HERE

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.988
BUT- IT COULD DO NOTHING. INTO

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.589
JUICE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.725
MORE WATER I GUESS IS FOR

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.627
CREATING IS BUYING SOMEBODY'S

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.162
RIGHTS SO THAT THERE'S MORE

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.463
AVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF THE

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.365
PEOPLE THAT. IT I DON'T WILL

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.368
RIGHTS YOU DO YOU DO SO IF WE

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.403
VICE OF THESE THERE'S MORE WATER

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:51.406
. LEVEL IS LITTLE IS IT HE IT

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.041
HELPS. THE REMAINING PEOPLE IN

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.643
THE SECTOR THAT'S THE THEORY

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.278
RIGHT WELL IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.980
DISCUSSION WHETHER IT'S NOT IT'S

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.681
GOOD OF AFFECTED NOT BUT THERE

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.316
ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE.

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:06.021
PEOPLE NOW THAT. WOULD BE

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.522
WILLING TO SELL THE RIGHT IT'S

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:08.890
WHICH WOULD. A BANK OF ONE

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:09.725
RIGHTS THAT THE LITTLE WATER

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.460
AVAILABLE COULD GO TO THE

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.494
REMAINING ENTITIES THAT USE IT.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.862
HOW ABOUT US DISCRETES MORE

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.397
WATER WE HAVEN'T CREATED NEW

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.599
WATER IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE FOR

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.501
THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND WE WANT

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.635

WATER BUT THERE'S A WATERSHED.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:32.214
ABOVE THOSE STRUCTURES THAT IS

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.016
THE REAL THE REAL. RESERVOIRS

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:36.852

IN. AND WE WERE GOING TO GET ON

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:41.723
THE GROUND WE'RE GONNA PROTECT

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:42.724
OUR WATER. BECAUSE WE'RE SO FAR

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:45.394
BEHIND THE CURVE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.696

OF ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.308
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.277
PROJECTS THAT WE DIDN'T FUND

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.779
BECAUSE WE GAVE THE MONEY TO

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.714
CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:07.382

ON I'M ON OF THAT BILL IN TOTAL

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.755
CREATE WATER INSTEAD OF JUST

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.490
TAKING WATER FROM OTHER PEOPLE

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:16.591
AND PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.993
AND PAYING THEM FOR BECAUSE

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.661

MANY YEARS OBVIOUSLY SMALLER

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.737
PROJECTS MORE DISCREET EASIER

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:38.240

OTHER WATER STORAGE PROJECT.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.382
THERE IS GONNA NEED TO BE

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.017
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WILL NEED TO

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.318
BE ALLOCATED FROM THE STATE BUT

THE LARGEST WATER STORAGE

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:36.665
PROJECT THIS STATE IS SEEN. IN

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.600
DECADES JUST WANT TO BE SUPER

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.402

DOLLARS OR MORE LAYING AROUND

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.347
THAT WE COULD PUT INTO IT SO AS

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:54.015
WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.050
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.284
ANYTHING OUGHT NOT TO HAVE

STATE WHEN IT COMES EMERGENCY

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:16.438
WATER STORAGE. ANTI PROJECTS

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.373
ADDITIONAL WELLS. IN CELL HI I'M

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.742

TRAIN BY ARE SAFE DRINKING WATER

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:50.572
TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.840
THE WATER THAT THEY DID THAT

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.475
CONSUMER ISSUES AND THE OTHERS

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.510
SOME MIGHT NOT BE A DIRECT

01:21:55.577 --> 01:22:00.081
INVESTMENT- IN STORAGE BUT WE

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.284

DOOR AND WILDFIRE COMING IN THE

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:17.999
BACK DOOR SO- THINKING THINKING

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.534
ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:21.035
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS FUNDING

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.770
WILL BE AN IMPORTANT DETAIL TO

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.707
WORK OUT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.542

ADVANCED BIO DIVERSITY- AND

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.421
ELEVATE THE ROLE OF NATURE THE

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:42.357
FIGHT AGAINST. CLIMATE CHANGE

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:44.826
WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT IF YOU'VE

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:45.827
THOUGHT ABOUT IT WOULDN'T

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:47.362

GOALS. SO I THINK. THAT'S ONE OF

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:59.607
THE THINGS I THINK AGAIN WOULD

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:00.441
BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:02.143
ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:03.277
STRUCTURING THIS PACKAGE TO BE

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:04.545
COMPLEMENTARY- WHEN I THINK ONE

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.347

OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.420
HIGHLIGHTED I'M ABOUT THE

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.155
GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS THAT IT'S

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.691
DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT. WHERE

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:19.627
EXACTLY THAT WILL GET US- IN

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:20.495
TERMS OF MEETING THOSE THE

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:22.397
PERSON WITH A THIRTY BY THIRTY

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.631
GOALS- IN SOME OF THE SOME OF

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:25.299
THE COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.534
THAT IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.670
SEE OKAY WELL. IS THAT WE KNOW

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:29.904
WE KNOW KIND OF WHERE WE ARE

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.506

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING GAS AND I

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:39.814
THINK ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO

THINK ABOUT IS TRYING TO

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.316
QUANTIFY THE EXTENT POSSIBLE.

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.484

OF COMPLEMENT THAT AND I THINK

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:48.756
AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.924
BECAUSE LEGISLATURE CAN PROBABLY

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.259

HOW IT IS TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.598
AND REALLY MAYBE EVEN CONSIDER

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.667
TARGETING THAT DEFINES THE

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:01.736
EXTENT POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:02.503

ARE THE GOALS REALLY THE

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:07.875
LEGISLATURE HAS- AND IF THEY'RE

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:09.277
CONSISTENT WITH THE- WITH THE

LAN MASS THAT'S A NUMBER THAT'S

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:23.791
JUST. ACREAGE RIGHT. OUR HOW

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:24.926
MAY. SQUARE MILES AND THEN YOU

KNOW. THE DAYS THERE'S THE

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.365
SCIENCE BASED. BIODIVERSITY

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:33.835
ELEMENT OF IT IS GIGANTIC IT'S A

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.403
BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG IT'S NOT

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.605
THAT BIG IT'S CRITICAL. FOR THAT

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:40.508

ARE SORT OF YOU KNOW IT'S GOT

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.000
BIODIVERSITY IT IT IT MEETS ALL

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.769
THE REQUIREMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.570

EQUITY TRUST WE KNOW IT'S A

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.667
CONTINUING PROBLEM THAT THE

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:42.537
PRICE OF UTILITIES ENERGY AND

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.939
PRICE OF WATER- THAT THAT FOLKS

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.675

ELECTRICITY RATES IS AN ISSUE

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:16.370
THAT WE HAVE RAISED AS A PROBLEM

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:18.105
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.207
