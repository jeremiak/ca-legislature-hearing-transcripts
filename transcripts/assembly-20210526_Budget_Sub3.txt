AS CALIFORNIA EMERGES FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER THAT TO IS THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT WE WILL IMMEDIATELY FACE ADDITIONAL THREATS. SO FOR EXAMPLE AS OF TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS LESS THAN 2% OF ITS SNOW PACK REMAINING AND A SEVERE DROUGHT LOOMS OVER THE COMING SUMMER MONTHS. CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY REPORTED THIS ASTOUNDING NUMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WILDFIRE INCIDENTS THIS YEAR THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR. AND OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES HAVE ALREADY BURNED IN THE STATE. WE ARE BRACING FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF HARSH AND DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES POWER DISRUPTIONS AND SMOKE FILLED AIR. THE STRONG CALIFORNIA COMEBACK ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLANS OF FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PROVIDED RESOURCES FOR US TO PREPARE FOR THE COMING CHALLENGE. THESE FUNDS ALSO ALLOW US TO FINALLY BE PROACTIVE ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WE CAN INVEST IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY INCLUDING ADAPTATION PLANNING AND PROJECTS AND OPEN SPACE. WE CAN IMPROVE OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM ESPECIALLY FOR OPTIONS THAT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED LIKE TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. WE CAN BUILD UPON OUR CLEAN ENERGY SYSTEMS CONTINUE OUR WORLD LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN VEHICLE INNOVATION AND ADVANCES TO AGRICULTURE. AND WE CAN MAKE INVESTMENTS TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. BUT WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY MORE DAYS UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET DEADLINE DOES NOT GIVE US ENOUGH TIME TO- I TRULY THOUGHT FULLY ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THE AGENDA TODAY AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE. CONTAINS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN ACTION ITEMS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW THE SUB COMMITTEE TO CLOSE DOWN FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS AND ADVANCE THE BUDGET DISCUSSION FORWARD. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FOR MANY OF THE LARGER ITEMS AND PACKAGES THE STAFF OF MAN ABSTRACT PROPOSED ACTION TO ADVANCE. THE CONVERSATION. WE PLAN TO WORK WITH OUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS ON ITEMS FOR BOTH THE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET AND BEYOND. LIKE THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE EARLIER THIS YEAR WE WILL BRING THOSE AGREEMENTS BACK TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME OCCURS. I WILL BE ASKING FOR SOME MOTIONS TO DISPENSE WITH THE VERY LARGE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. I'VE ASKED STAFF TO ORGANIZE THE ISSUES AND TO MOTIONS TO EXPEDITE THIS ACTION. THEY ARE LENGTHY THE- NUMERICAL CHARACTERS FOR A CATEGORIES ARE CARP A QUITE LARGE.

BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THEIR STAFF EACH OF YOU HAS PROVIDED A THOUGHTFUL PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE IN OUR POWER. IN OUR POLICY AREA. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS IDEAS AND COMMITMENT THAT YOU ALL BRING TO THE HEARINGS.
