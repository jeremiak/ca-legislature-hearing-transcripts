00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.724
MILLION I BELIEVE HAVE I GOT

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.993
THE NUMBER CORRECTLY- AT LEAST

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.062
THROUGH AUGUST AND THIS

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.897
REPRESENTS A TWENTY SIX FOLD

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.032
INCREASE IN CLAIMS FROM PRIOR

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:26.135
TO CODE- APPROXIMATELY SIXTY

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:26.970
THOUSAND CLAIMS A DAY BUT

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.504
ACTUALLY I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.639
WELL CERTAINLY EXTREMELY LARGE

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.641
NUMBER. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.509
THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.544
AT LEAST WHEN I FIRST CAME TO

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.813
THE ASSEMBLY- THERE WERE

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.849
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:41.451
MILLION CLAIMS. IN THE

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.653
BEGINNING OF TWENTY TEN. AND

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.622
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT FIFTY

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:48.091
THOUSAND A DAY SO- ANYWAYS I

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:50.860
GUESS- WELL SIXTY THOUSAND

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:51.961
CERTAINLY LARGE AND FIFTY

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.463
THOUSAND. WE DO NEED TO THINK

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.564
ABOUT WHAT OUR BASELINE

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:57.100
CAPACITY SHOULD BE. AND WE

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.101
THINK ABOUT OUR BASELINE

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.402
CAPACITY WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:03.840
MANY- TERMS OF SPECIALISTS AND-

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.676
SO FORTH SO I GUESS ONE OF THE

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:09.078
QUESTIONS I DO HAVE- FOR AND I

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.179
APPRECIATE THAT IT'S

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:12.415
INTERESTING THAT- I THINK. OF

00:59:12.482 --> 00:59:13.750
ALL THE THREE PEOPLE PRESENTED

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.919
FROM DDD I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.987
THEM WERE ACTUALLY ON THE JOB.

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.857
PRIOR TO AUGUST. AND THE COVE

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.825
IT STARTED. SEVERAL MONTHS

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:28.231
BEFORE THEN- SO- BUT- MAYBE WE

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.500
CAN HAVE YOU SPEAK TO HOW

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:31.801

EDT. RIGHT NOW AND HOW LONG

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.811
DOES IT TAKE TO TRAIN SOMEONE

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.646
TO BECOME A SPECIALIST. THEN I

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:45.848
GUESS THE- THE THIRD PART OF

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:48.952
THE QUESTION AND I KNOW THAT-

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:50.720
MISTRIAL SINCE BOTH TOUCHED ON

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.854

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.323
WELL WE YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:55.291
LOOK PAST RECESSIONS. HOW MANY

SPECIAL SHOULD WE HAVE ON HAND.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.329
NOT HOW MANY SPECIALS WE NEED

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.496
TO PROCESS TWO THOUSAND CLAIMS

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.031
A DAY WHEN WE HAVE A LOW

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.099
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. BUT KNOWING

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.301
THAT. WAS COVERED WITH SIXTY

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.202
THOUSAND TODAY IN THE HEIGHT OF

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.838
THE- IN TWENTY TEN WITH FIFTY

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.406
THOUSAND A DAY. WHAT KIND OF

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.641
BASELINE CAPACITY SHOULD WE

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.843
HAVE ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.911
IN TERMS OF PERSONNEL

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.212
ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO THE

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.313
FACT THAT YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.848
TAKES TO TRAIN SOMEONE TO BE. A

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.116
SPECIAL SO HOW MANY SPECIALISTS

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.784

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.619
IT TAKE TRAIN TO TRAIN SOMEONE

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:27.090
TO BE THAT SPECIALIST. AND THEN

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.324
HOW MANY SHOULD WE HAVE ON HAND

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:30.960
AT ANY TIME BECAUSE- WE HAVE A

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:35.365
RECESSION YOU KNOW. IT'S THAT

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:36.299

PERIOD YOU KNOW WHAT. IT

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:39.669
DOESN'T ACTUALLY TAKE A YEAR

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.070
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN I MEAN OFTEN

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.638
TIMES IT HAPPENS FAIRLY SHORTLY

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.941
SO- PERHAPS A POUND OF CAROL

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:45.875

LONG IT TAKES TO TRAIN YOU KNOW

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:13.603
I KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.838
THE STRIKE TEAM. LOOKED VERY

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:18.608
DEEPLY INTO- AND YOU KNOW THEY

SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.052
LOOKING INTO RIGHT NOW ABOUT

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.588
HOW WE CAN TRUNCATE THAT TIME

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.223
LINE BECAUSE- WE DO NEED TO BE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.259
ABLE TO PAY THAT IF. ANOTHER

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.727
PANDEMIC HITS OR ANOTHER YOU

HAVE. AS YOU KNOW TREMENDOUS

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.753
NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.409
BREAKDOWN OF THE NPR'S. MY

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.077
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT TAKES

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:31.314
YEARS. TO BE AS PROFICIENT AS

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.583

WERE PROFICIENT- AT THAT TIME

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.237
TO DO BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.005
MOST EXPERIENCED STAFF. NOT TO

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.974

SO I UNDERSTAND THE 40% WERE

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.515

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.911
COULD ACTUALLY LAY OUT A BIT OF

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:24.113
A CONTACTS- INDEED THE

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.681
AUTOMATION GOAL THAT WAS SET

CLAIMS FROM AUTOMATED ASHION

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.936
SO THAT REDUCES THE NEED FOR

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:50.706
IBM MANUAL WORK WHICH REQUIRES

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:51.941
FURTHER TRAINING IN THE NEW

AND THEREFORE THE

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:21.504
RECOMMENDATION WAS BASED OFF

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:24.306
THAT. WHAT CAN WE DO FROM AN

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.976
AUTOMATION ASPECT TO MANAGE THE

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.644
MANUAL WORKLOAD THAT ARE

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.414
NECESSARY- YOU KNOW REQUIRED BY

EDT SO THAT THERE ARE FOUR

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.551
THROUGH AUTOMATION. TO LIMIT

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.787
THE NUMBER OF MANUAL WORK THAT

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.789
IS REQUIRED SO WITH THAT IN

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:43.559
MIND- THERE WAS A- ANALYSIS

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:45.594
THAT WAS DONE. BASED ON THE

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.029
CURRENT CAPACITY AND THE

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:49.498
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.700
THERE WAS A CIRCLE OF- BLESSED

WORKFLOW THAT THE ROK EDT HALF

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.042
THE CAPACITY WORTH SO THEREFORE

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.111
AND AUTOMATION GOAL WAS SET. TO

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:04.513
MAKE TWO TO ALLOW- YOU KNOW

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.449
THAT THAT THE NUMBER OF MEN WHO

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.817

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.985
UNDER THAT. AND THEREFORE YOU

COAST THAT WAS SENT OUT OF THE-

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.959
ID VERIFICATION PROCESS WAS THE

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.762
BIGGEST- BOTTLENECK IF YOU

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:22.064

AND- BASED ON THE CURRENT

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.370
TODAY'S FLOW 60% OF THE CLAIMS

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.206
THAT COME IN I COULD GO IN AN

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:31.841
AUTOMATIC PROCESS THAT DOES NOT

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.909
REQUIRE A MANUAL FOR WORKFLOW.

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.945
AND 40% DOES REQUIRE A MANUAL

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.713
WORKFLOW. SO WITH THE

THAT. WE WERE MONITORING VERY

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:53.262
CLOSELY HOW DOES THAT CHANGE

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:55.564
THE NUMBER OF MANUAL CLAIMS

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.933

WILL TAKE THEM TO AN ID ME

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.693
IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.395
IN IN THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.464
MONITORING THE DATA ALONG WITH

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:31.734
EDT THAT 70% OF THOSE

APPLICANTS WERE ABLE TO

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.704
SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED.

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.239
THEMSELVES MEANING THEY SAY WHO

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.807
THEY ARE AND WITH YOU KNOW

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:41.877
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.345
VERIFIED THAT INDIVIDUAL.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.980
MENACE DOES CLAIM SEVENTY FIVE

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:46.282
OF 70% OF THE TOTAL

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.217
APPLICATION. WAS ABLE TO CLOSE

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:50.386
WITHOUT VERIFICATION AND THAT

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:54.390
70% IT'S VERY MUCH ON TARGET-

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.859
IN IN OUR- ESTIMATE IN TERMS

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.895
OF- THE SEPARATION WITH THOSE

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.231
CLAIMANTS THAT HAVE THE- I

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.099
IDENTITY THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.601
VERSUS POTENTIALLY SOME

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.903
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THAT WE

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.641
VERY MUCH WANT TO PREVENT- FOR

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.208
COMING IN TO EAT THESE WORK

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.677
LOOK. NOW THAT WOULD CLAIMING

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:16.211
THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:19.281
VERIFIED- THEMSELVES WITH THE

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:20.215
ADDENDUM THE END OF THE

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.051
VERIFICATION PROCESS THOSE

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:24.820
CLAIM OF COMMANDS TO EDT AND TO

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.389
BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE U. I.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:34.063
ONLINE PROCESS. AND FROM THERE.

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.564
H. OF THE CLAIMS THAT WERE

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.567
AUTOMATICALLY FILED- THROUGH A

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:40.235
TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AND

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:42.771
THEREFORE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.239
THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:47.042
REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.344
AND THIS GOES BACK TO YOUR

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:53.382
POINT- SENATOR PAN. THAT YOU

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.416
KNOW IF THE SENA OF THAT

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:56.652
REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION-

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.187
IT'S MANAGEABLE BASED ON THE

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:00.756
CURRENT BASELINE OF EDT THAT

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.491
BAN AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:05.060
VERY VERY HELPFUL. IN MOVING

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:08.897
THESE CLAIMS ALONG- SO DIED

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.532
PROCESS IS BEING MONITORED

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.768
CLOSELY BY EDT AND THE EARLY

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:16.438
INDICATION IS SIDE- IT'S GOING

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.407
IN THE VERY VERY GOOD TREND.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:21.010
AND I BELIEVE- I'LL PROBABLY

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.212
ANOTHER WEEK OR SO- THAT WILL

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.314
BE MORE DATA- THAT CAN BE

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.016
PRESENTED TO LOOK IF THAT TREND

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.784
STAYS AS WE MENTIONED BECAUSE

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:32.254
THIS REALLY JUST IMPLEMENT IT

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:32.821
IN A WEEK AND A HALF AGO SO

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.591
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.726
THROUGH. A COMBINATION OF

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.728
AUTOMATING THE IDENTITY

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.964
VERIFICATION PROCESS TO REALLY

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.866
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:44.900
THAT NEED TO BE PROCESS

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.336
MANUALLY SO THAT THERE ARE FOUR

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.937
EDT ARE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.606
THE WORKFLOW AND CONTINUE TO

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:55.644
MOVE. FORWARD WITH TYPICALLY. I

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.379
HOPE THAT DRESS QUESTION.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.347
THAT'S HOW YOU DIDN'T QUITE

01:11:58.414 --> 01:11:59.882
TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU HOPE. THAT

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:02.718
YOU SAID PER. WHAT THE ULTIMATE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.920
AND IS SET OVER TRYING TO

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:05.954
IMPROVE FROM 70% OR IS THAT

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:06.755
THAT I MEAN I KNOW YOU ONLY

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.023
HAVE A WEEK AND A HALF OF

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.392
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. YEAH AND

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.594
I'LL I'LL CLARIFY THAT ACTUALLY

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.731
THE- 70% OF THE IDENTITY

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.933
VERIFICATION PASSING RATE.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.170
WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT AND

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.805
I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU DO AT.

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:23.839
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.574
A CLEAR SEPARATION OF THE

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.342
DANITY VERIFICATION REGIME

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:30.245
VERSUS THE EDT AUTOMATION RIGHT

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.413
OKAY BECAUSE ON THE IDENTITY

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.615
VERIFICATION RATE. YOU ACTUALLY

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.484
DO NOT WANT A VERY HIGH NUMBER

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:37.219
BECAUSE IF IT IS AND PERHAPS A

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.954
VERIFICATION CHECK IS TOO

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.190
RELAXED GRAHAM YOU WANTED TO

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.459
HAVE. A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.360
AND ON THE NATIONAL STANDARD

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.197
IT'S- FOR THEM LESS COMPLEX

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.399
STATES IT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.668
MORE COMPLEX STATES SUCH AS

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:55.771
CALIFORNIA- IT IS 70% IT'S

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.573
RIGHT ON THE MARK. OKAY SO

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:58.707
THAT'S WHY THE AUTOMATED

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.275
IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM AND I

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:01.777
UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOAL IS TO

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.146
GET MADE UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.348
SYSTEM BUT OVERALL FOR THE

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.517
OVERALL VALUATION TO. DO

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.852
AUTOMATED PROCESSING FOR MUCH

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.587
HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS ARE

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:12.988
BEING SUBMITTED CORRECT.

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.556
CORRECT AND THAT'S THE SECOND

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:17.259
PERCENTAGE IS THAT AFTER PEOPLE

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.594
GET THROUGH THE IDENTITY

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.163
VERIFICATION- YOU KNOW MEANING

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.097
THAT PART IT'S ALREADY

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.066
AUTOMATED THEN YES IN THE

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.367
STRIKING REPORT THERE IS A

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:28.170
HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF 9890%

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.404
CLASS. THROUGH THE REMAINING

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.974
PART OF THE AUTOMATION THE EDT

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.876
IT'S VERY MUCH WORKING TOWARDS

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.411
AND I HAND IT BACK TO CAROL

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.680
SPEAK TO THAT EFFORT- AS THE

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:44.953
CURLY TREND. DATA IS LOOKING

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.022
VERY GOOD OKAY. SO MAYBE CAROL

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:47.589
ANSWER SO THE 90% IS OF ALL

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:48.190
CLAIMS BEING SOME. MOVING FOR

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:48.891
OR IS IT HIDING FOR OF THIS

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:51.560
PERCENT THEY GOT THROUGH IT ME.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.061
WELL IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.197
WHAT WE ARE WHOLE GOAL IS THAT

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.466
WHEN. IT'S ALL PART AND PARCEL

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.102
OF THE SAME EXPERIENCE THE

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.303
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:04.273
INTO OUR SYSTEM. FINALLY AND

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.274
GRATEFULLY THEY'RE NOW GOING

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.508
THROUGH IDENTITY VERIFICATION

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.544
FIRST THAT'S ID ME AND WHEN

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.212
THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THROUGH THAT

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.713
THEY RE ENTER THE ET DE

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.816
PLATFORM TO FILE THEIR CLAIMS.

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.417
SO WEIRD OUR GOAL IS TO LOOK AT

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:17.352
IT IN ITS COMPLETE TOTALITY OF

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.987
AUTOMATION MEANING THAT NO ONE

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.355
HAD TO TOUCH ANYTHING AS

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.057
DIRECTOR TOM EXPRESSED. WE ARE

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.559
VERY EARLY INTO THIS PRODUCT

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.893
PROCESS BUT WE ARE VERY

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.595
ENCOURAGED BY WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:27.663
WITH THESE CLAIMS THAT ARE

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.231
COMING IN WHAT WE'RE STILL

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.566
REVIEWING THEIR DATA. THEY'RE

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.201
MOVING THROUGH LIGHTNING FAST

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.268
AND I HOPE TO HEAR FROM THE

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.470
PUBLIC THAT. FOR THAT THEY ARE

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.905
HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE WELL AS

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:37.673
WELL AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GET

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.007
THAT FEEDBACK AND BRING THAT

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:41.009
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE 30% WHO

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:42.377
DOESN'T GO THROUGH IT NEEDED

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.346
STAT- WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM I

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.081
MEAN. FRIDAY INTO A MANUAL

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.382
PROCESS ARE THERE AND SOME

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:51.553
OTHER EVALUATION THAT. CAN TAKE

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.221
THEM INTO THE AUTOMATED PROCESS.

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.222
THERE IS AN OPTION FOR MEN FILE

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.591
WE HAVE SEEN NO GREAT CHANGE IN

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.492
THAT AS WELL BECAUSE- IT IS TWO

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:59.494
PRONGED SO AT THIS POINT- SO

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.362
WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED ABOUT

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.563
THAT THERE'S NO INCREASE IN THE

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.799
MANUAL. CLAIM FILINGS WHAT

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.100
WE'RE LEARNING- AGAIN WE'RE

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.802
VERY NEW WITH ID ME IS THAT

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.304
WHAT THEY ARE RESTING. IS

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.806
LIKELY FRAUD. AND QUITE

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:12.741
HONESTLY THIS IS WHAT HE DID

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:15.510
WAS WHAT WE WERE NOT CAPTURING-

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.846
UP FRONT. AND IN THAT'S

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:20.215
INDICATIVE OF THE SIGNIFICANT

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:22.651
REDUCTION IN CLAIM FILINGS ONE

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.653
SINCE WE STOPPED THE AUTOMATIC

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.022
BACKDATING OF COOL CLAIMS. INTO

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.892
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ID ME IF

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.093
THERE ARE TRUE CLAIMANTS THEY

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.128
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.429
IT IT MAY HAVE SEVERAL

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:35.697
ITERATION AND DIRECTOR TOM CAN

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.134
HOW TO MAKE IT THROUGH. IF YOU

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.136
ARE A TRUE INDIVIDUAL SO VERY

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.538
FEW SHOULD. TRULY NOT BE ABLE

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.007
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE IDENTITY

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.675
VERIFICATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THE

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:50.445
LAST. STOP IS REALLY TO HAVE AN

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.281
OPEN- EXCHANGE WITH AN

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:55.317

VERIFICATION TO A LIVE PERSON

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:07.562

SUCCESSFUL BUT BACK TO YOUR

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:15.037
QUESTION THAT 30% WE DO

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:17.105
INDICATE THAT THAT IS MOSTLY.

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.407
FRAUD AND FOR THOSE THAT

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:20.442
PERHAPS IT'S NOT WE ARE STILL

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.543
LOOKING TO FIND THAT THEY WOULD

ENDED UP BEING THE BEST IDEA

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:14.128
AFTER YOU'VE GONE DOWN THAT

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:16.631
ROAD I MEAN THEY WILL BE

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:17.999
INVOLVED AT ANY POINT IN TERMS

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:22.036
OF. IN EVEN IN A FEEDBACK LOOP

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.671
OUTLOOK SPEAK I'M SURE SENATOR

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.907
REGISTER SHE MIGHT STILL BE ON

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:28.610
BUT ARE. ONGOING RELATIONSHIP

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.044
WITH TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.613
BECAUSE MOST OF THE STRIKE TEAM

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.248
RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT DID. HE

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.017
HAVE AN ELEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.087
DIGITAL INNOVATION THOSE ARE

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:40.788
OUR CLOSE CONTINUED ONGOING

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.657
PARTNERS TO SEE THIS THROUGH

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:43.925
THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:45.460
HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. SHARE

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.462
SHARE ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH ONE

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:48.596
QUICK QUESTION I HAD TO STEP

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:50.231
AWAY FOR A SECOND SO I WILL PUT

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:52.834
MY COLLEAGUES ASK ABOUT IT IS

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.702
THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO FRAUD-

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:55.703
THAT THAT I DON'T WANT TO

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.772
BELABOR BECAUSE I'M CLEAR THAT

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.774
YOU KNOW. MANY LARGE SYSTEMS

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.643
INCLUDING THE IRS YOU KNOW CAN

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.444
FALL VICTIM TO PEOPLE WHO

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.413
WILLFULLY WANT TO DEFRAUD

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.314
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.383
UNFORTUNATE- I GUESS OUR

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.385
CONCERN IS YOU KNOW HOW WE MOVE

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:13.121
FORWARD AND ENSURE THAT WE

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:13.721
BUILD A SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.555
NEEDS. OF FOUR CALIFORNIANS

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:17.025
WITH VALID CLAIMS. WHILE BEING

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.494
CAREFUL ABOUT NOT IMPLICITLY

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.429
CREATE A SYSTEM WITH NEGATIVE

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.064
BIAS I DON'T WANT TO CREATE

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.699
FIRE WALLS THAT ARE SO

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:28.169
STRINGENT. THAT VALID CLAIMS

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.038
GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DRAMA

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.040
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO. KEEP

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:36.878
THE BAD. GUYS AT BAY. AN IMAGE

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:39.514
OF IS NOT FERRIS I CAN ATTEMPT

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.282
TO ANSWER THAT THAT IS ALSO A

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.718
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE I MEAN WE

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:44.585
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:47.288
CLAIMANTS- GET THE BENEFITS

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.624
THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. AND

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:51.159
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:54.328
A AN AGENCY THAT. IS YOU KNOW

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:56.097

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.574
ABOUT. ID ME WE DO BELIEVE WILL

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.277
PREVENT MOST OF THAT FRAUD IF

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:12.413
NOT ALL OF IT. GOING FORWARD-

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.182
AND IT IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:15.616
THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN LOOKING

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.285
AT FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:18.686
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IS HOW WE

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.755
CAN. ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THAT

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.190
ARE CAUGHT UP IN THAT FRAUD AND

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:24.692
HOW WE CAN GET THEM THERE ON.

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.728
THEIR BENEFITS AS SOON AS

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.896
POSSIBLE GREAT GREAT BECAUSE

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:30.598
BECAUSE WE DID GET SOME CALLS

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:31.933
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHERE YOU

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.334
KNOW WHO CLAIMED THAT THEIR

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:34.402
ADDRESS PLEASE USE THAT THEY

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.803
AREN'T COMMITTING THE FRAUD.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.804
BUT NOW THEY'RE AFRAID TO

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.306
BECAUSE THEY'RE DRESSES USED

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:39.640
AND THEY'VE BEEN LABELED AS

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.509
WELL- BUT YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT

THROUGH THAT. WE ARE. THANK YOU.

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:48.483
WE'RE TALKING LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.818
A WILL. WHICH WAS A BUDGET

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.120
COMMITTEE BILL THAT REQUIRED

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.155
EDT TO CREATE A DASHBOARD WITH

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.523
THE INTENT TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.091
BOTTLENECKS IN THE SYSTEM

01:29:57.158 --> 01:30:01.763
DELAYED ACCESS TO BENEFITS- TWO

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.197
QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.866
DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO TARGET

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:07.502
RESOURCES. TO ENSURE IDENTIFIED

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:10.571
BOTTLENECKS ARE CLEAR TO OUR

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:11.038
SYSTEMS CAN WORK MORE

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:13.641
EFFICIENTLY. AND SECONDLY- DO

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.676
YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDED

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.879
CHANGES AS OF YET. TO THAT

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:21.349
DASHBOARD. SENATOR NANCY

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.718
VARIOUS- SO I'LL TAKE THAT THE

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:25.686
SECOND QUESTION FIRST BECAUSE I

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.121
MAY NEED CLARIFICATION ON THE

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:30.558
FIRST QUESTION BUT- WE ARE WE

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.760
HAVE HEARD IT- FROM THE

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:35.730
LEGISLATURE FROM STAKEHOLDERS-

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.865
THAT D. A. B. ONE OH SEVEN IN

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:38.866
OUR DASHBOARDS ARE A BIT

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.301
CONFUSING YOU KNOWTHERE'S A

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.436
LOT OF NUMBERS. AND WORDS IN

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:43.905
THE FOOTNOTES ARE LONGER THAN

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.773
THE NUMBERS AND YOU KNOW SO WE

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.809
ARE WORKING ON INTERNALLY BUT

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.311
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I DO

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:51.479
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.948
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN AND WE

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.250
SHOULD EXACTLY A CONVERSATION

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:59.253
IT I'M ON THIS ALREADY- IN THE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.888
ASSEMBLY AND I'M I LOOK FORWARD

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.223
TO HAVING ONE IN THE SENATE TO

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.192
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CHANGES.

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:06.260
MAKES SENSE I THINK YOU KNOW

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:09.063
FOR ME I ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW MY

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.131
SIX YEAR OLD YOU SHOULD BE ALE

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.799
TO DRAW A LINE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.334
IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.636
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:17.004
WOULD UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.673
DON'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND YOU

01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:20.875
KNOW OF ALL THE E. G. D.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.143
KNOWLEDGE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:27.448
HERE HAVE SO MUCH SO THERE. WE

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.216
ARE ANTICIPATING A LETTER TO

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:29.951
THE JAIL BC REGARDING CHANGES

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.018
WE DO WANT TO HAVE OUR REACH

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.453
FIRST WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.655
JUST INTERNALLY AMONGST

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:35.223
OURSELVES ON WHAT THAT LOOKS

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:37.425
LIKE SO THAT'S THAT ANSWER AND

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.060
I'M I'M SORRY I SORT OF MISS

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.229
THAT. THAT'S THAT'S THE AND

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.964
THAT'S THE ANSWER ABSOLUTELY

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.365
BECAUSE I AGREE SOMETIMES IN

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:48.202
OUR EFFORT TO YOU KNOW- MOVE

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:50.504
TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY WE MAKE

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.840
WEBSITES AVAILABLE THAT NO ONE

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.243
UNDERSTANDS. AND THEN WE SAY

01:31:55.309 --> 01:32:00.514
WHAT'S ON. OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:03.417
SO. IT'S NOT INTENTIONALLY. BUT

01:32:03.484 --> 01:32:04.785
IT'S NOT HELPFUL THAT THE DATA

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:06.787
IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT IN SUCH A

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.222
WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN CLEARLY

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:09.357
EITHER MANIPULATED OR

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.158
UNDERSTAND IT. IT MIGHT AS WELL

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:12.159
NOT BE THERE SO THAT'S VERY

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.595
GOOD TO HEAR. HI CHER G. L. B.

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:16.230

RECEIVING THE LETTER SOMEONE

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:24.605
MENTIONED EARLIER IT MAY HAVE.

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.674
BEEN MISSED WE RIVER MEMBER.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:27.642
ABOUT THE SNOW THE NOTION ABOUT

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:30.678

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:31.812
WONDERING ARE THEY MY

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.214
ASSUMPTION WAS YOU SAID THAT

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:35.716
WELL YOU KNOW MOST OF THOSE

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:36.217
REGULATIONS ARE PROBABLY

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:40.554
FEDERAL. BUT IF. THERE CAN AND

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:41.589
WILL BE A PROCESS. I READ THE

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:42.890
STRIKE TEAM REPORT I DON'T

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:45.192
REMEMBER REFERENCE IN IT IF

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:46.460
THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.562
ABOUT. INDEED IF THERE ARE

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:49.864
REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:52.099
UPDATED STREAMLINED. YOU KNOW

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:55.136
I. FOR ONE GET VERY FRUSTRATED

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:59.807
WHEN AS A GOVERNMENT. WE SAY

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:00.408
WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.809
DONE IT. AND YET NO ONE CAN WHY.

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:03.477
AND SO I'M I'M NOT IN THIS MAY

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.712
NOT BE FRONT BURNER BECAUSE

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:05.846
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.848
IN AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:08.449
RESOURCES WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.485
TO GET. APPROPRIATE NET CLAIMS

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.821
OUT THE DOOR. BUT BUT- IS THERE

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.256
A PROCESS OR GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:16.590
WHO CAN BEGIN TO LOOK AT

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:19.060
REGULATIONS AND PROCESS SEES

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:21.062
THE FIGURE OUT. IF YOU NEED

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.264
LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION TO

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.598
MAKE IT GO AWAY IF IT IS A

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.667
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONIS

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:30.571
WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRULY CREATE

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:31.005
APPROPRIATE GREATER

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.808
EFFICIENCIES CAROL WILLIAMS

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.742
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:36.978
I ABSOLUTELY CAN- IT TESTED

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:38.746
THERE ARE THERE IS A GROUP OF

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.348
PEOPLE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:41.916
WHAT THEY'RE TUNED INTO AND

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:44.986
IT'S NOT JUST- REGULATIONS THAT

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:46.954
MAY NEED TO COME THROUGH THAT

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.122
STATE LEVEL BUT IT'S ALSO

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.123
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:49.924
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAUSE

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.292
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE FOUR

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:54.395
CORNERS HAS BEEN. AND WE'VE HAD

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:55.396
VERY ENCOURAGING CONVERSATIONS

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:56.130
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.865
BECAUSE CERTAINLY THIS IS A

01:33:57.932 --> 01:34:00.101
DIFFERENT TIME AND- PERHAPS

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.235
THINGS NEED TO CHANGE AND BE

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.570
MODIFIED BUT IT IT CERTAINLY IS

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.472
A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT THAT WE

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.207
ARE KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT WE'RE

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.808
RUNNING UP AGAINST SO THAT WE

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:08.676
NEED TO HAVE THE PROPER

THERE ARE THE FEDERAL STANDARDS

01:37:24.638 --> 01:37:28.008
IN A DIMENSION WHICH IS A RULE

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.944

WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS AND WE

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.683

LIKE MANY OTHER STATES. WERE

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.022

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:56.670
SUBJECT OF LABOR AGENCIES BEAR

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:57.771

EXTRA BURDEN THAT THAT ISN'T

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:11.352
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:13.420
FEDERAL STANDARDS SO THERE ARE

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:14.722
A RANGE OF POLICIES THAT WE

WORK THERE WILL ALWAYS PERHAPS

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:33.941
BE A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:36.076
THERE HAVE TO BE A MANUAL TYPE

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.778

EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TRAINED CAN

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:49.923
TRANSITION FROM THOSE HISTORIC

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:53.060
MANUAL TOUCH POSITIONS IN TWO

HERE IN MY DISTRICT IN SANTA

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.529

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:12.139
ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL AND I

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:14.108
KNOW THAT THAT IS SORT OF THE

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:16.210
CULTURE OVER D. D. D. AND I SO

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:18.112
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. OF

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:20.681
THAT BEING SAID WHEN WE'VE HAD

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:23.784
THIS CRISIS- AND THAT HAS

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.853
REALLY IMPACTED SO MANY

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:28.856
CALIFORNIANS SO MANY AMERICANS-

01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.924
IT'S ONE THING TO BE WORKING.

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:32.493
YOU KNOW TWELVE HOURS A DAY

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:33.460
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK BUT FOR THE

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.462
RECIPIENTS WHO ARE GETTING

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:39.733
THEIR BENEFITS I IT'S HARD FOR

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.802
THEM TO SEE BEYOND THEIR OWN

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.737
PERSONAL NEEDS- AND THAT'S

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.540
UNDERSTANDABLE SO- I DO WANT TO

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:47.641
THANK YOU BUT BUT I AM

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:50.177
CONCERNED AS EVERYONE HAS

01:40:50.244 --> 01:40:52.846
ARTICULATED- SO FAR. BECAUSE IT

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:55.983
SEEMS TO BE ALMOST-

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.584
INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT IS

01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:00.320
TAKING SO LONG TO GO THROUGH

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.556
THIS PROCESS- IT SEEMS AS I

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:03.657
UNDERSTAND IT THEY'RE REALLY

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:06.693
KIND OF TWO. BASIC ISSUES HERE

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.163
ARE THE PEOPLE SEEKING. THIS

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:12.032
ASSISTANCE ARE THEY LEGITIMATE

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:14.401
ARE LEGITIMATELY ENTITLED. SO

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:15.035
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:16.069
DO IS DETERMINE WHETHER THEY

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:17.771
ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE AND

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.640
THE NEXT IS TO DETERMINE

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:20.207
WHETHER THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.676
THOSE BENEFITS- I DON'T KNOW

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.678
WHAT THE OTHER HAD A KIND OF

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.980
COMPLEXITIES ARE BUT- IT SEEMS

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:28.348
TO ME THOSE ARE THE TWO BASIC

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.184
ISSUES. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.719
AND- THE FACT THAT IT TAKES

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.154
YEARS TO TRAIN PEOPLE

01:41:34.221 --> 01:41:36.990
APPROPRIATELY. SAYS TO ME AS A

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:38.592
POLICYMAKER THERE'S SOMETHING

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:40.294
WRONG HERE IF THE SYSTEM IS SO

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.463
DIFFICULT- NOT ONLY FOR

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:44.565
INDIVIDUALS SEEKING- THE

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:47.601
ASSISTANCE ARE A MUST- INJURE

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:48.569
BUT THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING IT

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:52.239
SO- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR

01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:54.608
FIRST MY FIRST QUESTION. REALLY

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:57.778
IS HAVE THE PROBLEM'S BEEN MORE

01:41:57.845 --> 01:41:59.246
RELATED TO THE LACK OF

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:02.783
TECHNOLOGY. OR THE- THE LACK

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:07.788
OF- OF TRAINING. IN A WORDS

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:09.623
THAT THIS. ISSUE MANAGEMENT

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:12.359
STAFFING OR OTHER NON I TEACH

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:13.460
SHOES ARE REALLY IS THIS

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.362
SOMETHING WHERE IF WE DIVED

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:17.798
INTO THIS- AND THAT'S THE STATE

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.299
THAT INVENTS ALL THE TECHNOLOGY

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:21.168
BUT CERTAINLY HISTORICALLY HAS

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:23.136
NOT DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:26.240
APPLY IT. AFFECTED LAKE. OR

01:42:26.306 --> 01:42:29.176
ECONOMICALLY- IF WE LOOK TO TRY

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.378
TO AS AS SENATOR MITCHELL IS

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:34.982
SUGGESTING REALLY- I HAD. A

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:38.051
MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED AND

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:40.354
EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGICAL-

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.189
OVERLAY TO THE SYSTEM WOULD

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:45.425
THAT MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK-

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.528
TRULY EXPEDITIOUSLY- AND

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:49.663
EFFECTIVELY FOR THAT THE

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.366
CLIENTS THAT YOU HAVE. HI

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:54.468
SENATOR THIS IS CAROL WILLIAMS-

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:56.236
PERHAPS- DIRECTOR TOM CAN

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:59.139
ASSIST WITH THIS AS WELL BUT MY

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:01.174
UNDERSTANDING IS. THE ENEFITS

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:03.544
SYSTEM MODERNIZATION WAS REALLY

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:06.113
I TRIED DOING. JUST THAT

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:07.548
BECAUSE IT IT WILL CERTAINLY

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:09.049
GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:14.821
OUR ABSOLUTE PRIMARY. WE

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:15.422
CERTAINLY HAVE OTHER BENEFITS

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:17.991
TO PAY OUT TO THE CLAIMANTS M.

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:18.892
JUST MY SHORT TIME BEING THE

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.928
LACK OF A FULLY ROBUST

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.362
INTERPRET INTEGRATED CASE

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:24.097
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS WHERE WE

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:27.434
LOSE TIME. AND WHERE THERE IS-

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.403
MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PROCESSES

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:33.740
WHICH TAKE TIME TO GO THROUGH-AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:34.341
WHAT YOU DON'T SEE BUT THAT'S

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.209
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. THESE

01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:38.579
CLAIMS HAVE SO MANY TOUCH

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.013
POINTS THEY GO THROUGH SO MANY

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.082
ITERATIONS BUT CERTAINLY

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.650
UPDATED SMART INTEGRATED

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:49.790
TECHNOLOGY WE CAN SEE YOUR WAY.

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:50.891
THROUGH THIS IN THE FUTURE. SO

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:51.592
THAT'S WHY I DO LOOK TO AT THE

01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:54.728
RIGHT TIME IS THE- VENTURE MLB

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.063
ALSO ADDRESSED BY THE STRIKING

01:43:56.129 --> 01:43:57.464
THANK YOU WHAT WHAT IS IT GOING

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:58.999
TO TAKE WHAT WHAT IS THE COST

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.701
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IS THAT

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:03.604
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. AND WHY

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:04.438
ARE WE NOT PURSUING IT IF IT

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:07.741
IS. YEAH AND- I COULD JUMP I'D

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:11.011
CHIME IN HERE- SENATOR JACKSON-

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.113
SO IF I'M ON THE STRIKE TEAM

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.648
ANALYSIS ACTUALLY IT'S A

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:17.884
COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:20.554
ARE- YOU KNOW FROM FROM FROM

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:22.255
AGES AGO THAT LACKS THE

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:25.792
FLEXIBILITY. TO ALIGN WITH THE

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.928
MEDIA AT A BUSINESS CHANGE OR

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.129
EVOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:30.931
REQUIRED IN RESPECT IN THE

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:33.266
RAPID RESPONSE OF THE PANDEMIC

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:34.835
THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:36.770
COST TO IT. BUT DISTRACTING

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.605
REPORT HAS ALSO POINTED OUT

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:41.475
THAT IF THERE ARE OPERATIONAL

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:43.143
M. POLICY PROCEDURE PROCESS

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.545
CHALLENGES THAT THE THAT NEEDED

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:48.048
TO BE STREAMLINED AND I THINK

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.417
ONE OF THE- PREVIOUS- I MADE

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.386
MAYBE WAS. A SENATOR MITCHELL

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.121
MAYBE LISTEN TO RECOUNT THAT

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:55.722
WAS ASKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.257
DO YOU DEAL WITH FRIDAY'S DON'T

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:58.925
LET'S LET'S NOT GET TOO TIGHT

01:44:58.992 --> 01:44:59.926
YOU KNOW ON THE FRAUD THAT

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:01.495
PREVENT THE GOOD YOU KNOW

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.530
INTENDED CLAIMANTS ACTUALLY GO

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:06.233
THROUGH AND THAT OF ITSELF. AND

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:07.367
DISTRACTING REPORT HAS

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:09.403
SUGGESTED AN EDT IS FOLLOWING

01:45:09.469 --> 01:45:12.139
SUIT ON THAT TOO LOOKING AT FOR

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.607
THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:16.009
OPERATION ASPECT WHAT CAN BE

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:19.146
DONE TO RIGHT SIZE THIS. SO AND

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:21.181
THEN IN ADDITION ALL OF THAT

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:22.716
THE M. AND THE MANAGEMENT

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:23.950
EFFICIENCY IN THE TRAINING

01:45:24.017 --> 01:45:26.353
THAT'S REQUIRED THAT PERHAPS

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.387
THERE IS A LOT OF MANUAL

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.089
PROCESS YOU KNOW HAVE YOU HEARD

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.558
FROM CAROL THAT IS NEEDED. THAT

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.493
IF THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.095
AUTOMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE YOU

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.264
KNOW A STRONG FOCUS SO I WOULD

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:38.098
SAY FROM THE STRIKING

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:39.332
OBSERVATION AND THE STRIKING

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.435
RECOMMENDATION IF THE HOLISTIC

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.437
APPROACH FROM A TECH POLICY

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:50.277
IMPROVEMENT THAT. NEEDED TO

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:51.545
HAPPEN IN THE IN IN ET. SO IT

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.447
WHEN YOU SAY A WHOLE LIST OF.

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:54.981
YOU MENTION. IN THE ISSUE. THAT

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:56.650
THERE WHAT WHAT ELSE IS

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.719
INCLUDED. IN THAT HOLISTIC

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:01.221
APPROACH THAT. REQUIRES WE

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:04.624
LOOK. OUTSIDE OF A TECHNOLOGY

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:06.359
IS THE PRIMARY. DRIVER

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:10.030
INEFFICIENCY IN THIS PROCESS. I

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:12.065
WENT OUT ON TOP OF THAT IT IS

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:14.935
REALLY- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:17.237
HUMAN CENTERED EXPERIENCE AND I

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.305
BELIEVE IN THE RESERVE

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:19.706
MENTIONED DAD AND THAT WAS YOU

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:21.842
KNOW VERY MUCH IN LINE MAN WITH

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:22.776
THE LABOR AGENCY

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.745
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH THAT

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.747
WHEN DESIGNING THESE PROCESS

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:28.915
AND OPERATION EFFICIENCY AND

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.317
THEREFORE COUPLED BY THE

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:32.452
TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE THAT. IT

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:34.588
REALLY HAS TO COME FROM WHAT IS

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:37.057
THE BEST EXPERIENCE THAT CAN BE

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:38.525
PROVIDED TO THESE CLAIMANT AND

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:40.293
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- THE

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.828
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:44.865
WELL AS THE OFFICE OF A DIGITAL

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.266
INNOVATION WILL CONTINUE TO

01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:47.400
WORK WITH THE V. D. AS EDT

01:46:47.467 --> 01:46:48.802
PURSUING THEIR NEW

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:50.737
MODERNIZATION EFFORT WHICH IS

01:46:50.804 --> 01:46:52.639
CALLED THE BUSINESS BOUGHT BY A

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.541
SYSTEM MODERNIZATION BSN. I HAD

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:56.109
TO MAKE SURE THAT FOCUS THAT'S

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.911
AT THE FOREFRONT THE USER

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.713
EXPERIENCE NEEDS TO DRIVE A LOT

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.782
OF THESE MODERNIZATION SO IF I

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.884
MAY WHEN IT COMES TO USER

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:05.986
EXPERIENCE. I MEAN MOST THESE

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:07.087
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO GET THOSE

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:08.455
PAYCHECKS SO THAT THEY CAN PAY

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.556
THEIR RENT PUT FOOD ON THE

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:11.691
TABLE WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:15.362
THIS- HUMAN EXPERIENCE. THAT IS

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.831
SO CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT THAT

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:21.234
YOU'RE FOCUSING ON IN ADDITION

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:23.270
TO THE TECHNOLOGY I MEAN

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:24.504
CERTAINLY IT'S NICE TO HAVE

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.106
SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE TO ASSURE

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:27.641
YOU THE MONEY'S COMING THAT

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:30.210
YOUR SITUATION IS BEING HANDLED

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.479
PROPERLY- BUT BEYOND THAT WHAT

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:34.214
IS THERE ABOUT THE HUMAN

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:35.849
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU FEEL.

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:40.220
REQUIRES. ADDITIONAL I'M

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:42.322
PLEASED AT THE- WORK. WHO WELL

01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:46.159
TRAINED- SO IN IN THIS OUR

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.494
PARENTS WE SOPHISTICATED

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:50.497
PROCESS. RIGHT AND I'M GONNA-

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:53.266
ASK MY- A COLLEAGUE- WE DIET TO

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:54.534
JUMP IN AS APPROPRIATE AS WELL

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.269
AND ALSO AS WELL AS MORE EDT

01:47:56.336 --> 01:47:58.138
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE. A

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.506
STRONG BELIEVER IN OF THIS AS

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:01.741
WELL I CAN SPEAK TO ADAM REESE

01:48:01.808 --> 01:48:03.376
BUT THEY'RE VERY BRIEFLY

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:05.078
SENATOR JACKSON DO YOU SEPARATE

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.847
EXPRESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:09.015
STARTED RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:10.851
MENU TOUCHES REQUIRE AND I

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:12.919
BELIEVE- JOHN FROM EARLY

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.688
ADMISSION TO IS PERHAPS THE

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.423
COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS ON

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:19.159
FILING. APPLICATION AND IS

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:21.328
PERHAPS THE ONLINE THESE TWO

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:23.029
EASY FOR SOMEBODY TO TRANSPOSE

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:24.331
THERE ARE YOU KNOW BIRTHDAY IN

01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:26.766
AUGUST NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:27.534
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. AND

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:31.037
BECAUSE OF THOSE- YOU KNOW- A

01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:33.506
DIFFICULT TO USE OF APPLICATION

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.307
OR DIFFICULTY IN THE

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:38.378
INSTRUCTION THAT CREATED- MORE

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:39.679
MENU TOUCH REQUIREMENTS. TOOL

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.915
TO FILE A CLAIM AND THE USER

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:44.017
EXPERIENCE ASPECT IS TO LOOK

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.585
FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THAT. AND

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.120
THEN ANOTHER THING I'LL HAND IT

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:48.655
OFF TO- WE DIAL IS YOU GETTING

TERMS OF WHERE THE STATUS OF

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:57.898
THE- CLAIM IS WILL GO A LONG

01:48:57.964 --> 01:48:59.799
WAY IN HELPING THE CLAIM AND

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.602
TO- YOU KNOW LESS ANXIETY ABOUT

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.271
WHERE THINGS ARE AT THE NEVER

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:05.171
HEARD BACK OR NOT KNOWING HOW

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:07.507
LONG. IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:08.375
ANOTHER USER EXPERIENCE

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:10.176
IMPROVEMENT BUT YOU GUYS

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:23.723
THINK WE YOU PUT AND ON AND

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.892
TELL YOU. IT DAILY WE THE- IS.

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:26.493
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW NOT A MAJOR

01:49:26.559 --> 01:49:28.561
PROCESS. OR IS THIS THE KIND OF

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:30.530
TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT IS

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.999
AVAILABLE OR WOULD BE AVAILABLE

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:33.767
THE REASON I'M BRINGING THIS UP

01:49:33.833 --> 01:49:36.369
IS THAT. PART OF THE CHALLENGE

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:37.404
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:39.539
STATISTICS OF THE NUMBER OF

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:41.975
CASES THAT SUDDENLY WELL I MEAN

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:42.475
WE HAD THIS PANDEMIC AND

01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:44.644
SUDDENLY. YOUR WORKLOAD WAS

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:47.414
EXTREME- AND YOU STILL AND THE

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.950
RECOMMENDATIONS SAY LOOK LET'S.

01:49:50.016 --> 01:49:52.218
TAKE SOME OF THESE NEW HIRES-

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:54.454
GIVE SOME MORE MENIAL TASK

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.389
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REALLY

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:57.057
UNDERSTAND THIS WORK ARE

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:59.993
SPENDING ALL THEIR TIME

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.161
TRAINING AND NOT DOING WORK SO

01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:02.729
I'M TRYING TO THINK- IS THERE

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.097
SOME WAY WE COULD BE MORE

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:07.767
PREPARED IN THE FUTURE. GOD FOR

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.868
BED BUGS. IT'S LIKELY WE'RE

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:10.603
GOING TO SEE THESE KINDS OF

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:13.840
SITUATIONS AGAIN. WHERE WE HAVE

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:16.343
THE TOOLS AVAILABLE SO THAT- WE

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:18.144
DON'T HAVE TO RUN OUT AND HIRE.

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.846
THOUSANDS OF NEW PEOPLE THAT WE

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:21.348
CAN'T TRAIN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE

01:50:21.414 --> 01:50:23.583
KNOW HOW TO DO THIS HAVE TO DO

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:24.150
THE WORK AND CAN'T SPEND THE

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:25.919
TIME TRAINING PEOPLE WHO. FOR

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.654
WHOM IT WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:30.156
AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET EDUCATED

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.392
ANYWAY SO. THAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.527
IT. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT ARE

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:35.929
THESE THINGS THAT ARE

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:39.299
REASONABLE TO PURSUE. YEAH AS A

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:41.434
CENTER JACKSON A DIET BUT NIGHT

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:43.703
FROM ODI ODD THAT HI YOU'RE

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:45.271
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE

01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:47.707
ARE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:49.209
WE CAN MAKE BOTH ON THE

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:50.910
TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE. THE NON

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:53.480
TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE HI TO BOTH

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.715
IMPROVE THE CURRENT EXPERIENCE

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:57.350
GIVING THEM THE STATUS OF THE

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.419
CLAIM AS YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT-

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:01.154
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS AT EVERY

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:03.289
POINT ALONG THE WAY. NOT JUST

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:04.591
THAT YOU HAVE CLEARED THE

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.793
IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION A

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.561
STEP IN THE PROCESS BUT YOU'VE

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:10.830
ALSO GONE IN CLEAR THE WAGE

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.332
COMPUTATION PART OF THE

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:14.968
PROCESS. THAT WE ARE WAITING ON

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:17.871
A CERTIFICATION- DOCUMENTS FROM

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.839
YOU ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.574
PARTS OF THE PROCESS I THINK

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.743
AND PROVIDING VISIBILITY INTO

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:28.681
THEM. AT THIS POINT. THE LEVEL

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:31.051
OF RESOLUTION OF THE UPDATES

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:32.452
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE OFTEN SAY

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.054

HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AND SO YOU

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:37.057
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:39.059
JUST A LITTLE MORE GRANULAR

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:40.060
DETAIL THAT SAYS. ARE YOU

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:42.462

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AS AS THE

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:58.111
CITY CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS

01:51:58.178 --> 01:52:00.580
CERTAINLY A PART OF IT- THERE

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:02.282
ARE OTHER PARTS OF IT AS WELL.

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:04.317
AND IT'S EXACTLY TRUE APPOINTED

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:10.023
BEING PREPARED FOR THE NEXT.

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:10.723
TIME WHERE WE REALLY TRY TO BE

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:11.658
A LITTLE MORE INTO. OF WHAT

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:13.293
PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE AND ADD ON.

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:15.228
THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:17.430
ISSUES AROUND DATA THERE ARE A

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:20.934
LOT OF ISSUES ABOUT BEING READY

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.703
TO GUIDE TO HAVE OUR SYSTEMS-

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:25.805
BE UPDATED WITH THE LATEST DATA

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:26.873
THAT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT.

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.274
SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO

01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:29.943
DO THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.111
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:32.278
IT'S ALSO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:33.947
INVESTMENT AROUND. MAKING SURE

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:35.315
THAT- THAT ALL THE DATA IS

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:37.283
FLOWING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.985
FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:42.355
EDTA. ARE THERE'S A THIRD PART

01:52:42.422 --> 01:52:43.556
TO IT AS WELL WHICH IS. IT'S

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:44.724
SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:47.594
RAISED- PRETTY STRONGLY I THINK

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.329
FROM THE EDT FRONTLINE STAFF.

01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:51.764
EDT FRONTLINE STAFF ARE ARE

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:54.167
REALLY INTERESTED IN. HELPING

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:56.603
CALIFORNIANS SOLVING THE ISSUES

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:57.904
RESOLVING THE CLAIMS YOU'LL

01:52:57.971 --> 01:53:00.907
HEAR THE WORD AND YOU SAW IT

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:01.407
PROBABLY IN THE STRIKING

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.977
REPORT. THE WORDS WORK ITEMS

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:05.111
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:07.013
THE GENERAL IDEA THAT WE NEED

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.248
THERE'S A LOT OF CHECKS THAT

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:09.983
YOU DO DO YOU HAVE TO DO. TO BE

01:53:10.049 --> 01:53:13.153
ABLE TO- TO SIGN OFF THAT EIGHT

01:53:13.219 --> 01:53:14.654
THAT THE CLAIM IS COMPUTED

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.122
RIGHTLY AND THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.723
GETTING THE MONEY THAT THEY

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.558
DESERVE BECAUSE- ULTIMATELY

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:19.159
THAT'S WHAT THEY REALLY CARE

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:21.828
ABOUT. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:23.997
TO MAKE THOSE STEPS AROUND WAGE

01:53:24.063 --> 01:53:26.900
COMPUTATION. EASIER ON WAGE

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:28.801
CALCULATIONS EASIER AND MAKE

01:53:28.868 --> 01:53:29.836
SURE THAT THE MONEY GETS OUT

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:32.305
THE DOOR FAST- THERE ARE SOME

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:33.306
FEDERAL RULES THAT ARE IN

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:35.608
PLACE- ABOUT HOW PEOPLE NEED TO

01:53:35.675 --> 01:53:38.211
CERTIFY- CITY CALIFORNIA. HAS

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:40.513
TAKEN SOME STEPS TO TRY TO-

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.415
ACCELERATE THAT AND TRY TO.

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.784
UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD HOW WE

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.152
COULD THRIVE WITHIN THAT

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:47.487
CONTEXT ESPECIALLY WITH THE

01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:49.022
POOL PROGRAM THAT WAS IN PLACE

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:51.224
WHICH HAD DRAMATICALLY. FEWER

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.792
RULES THAN NOT THAN THE U. I.

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:54.194
SYSTEM SO YOU TALK ABOUT ALL

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.128
THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:59.265
SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP. YOU'RE

01:53:59.332 --> 01:53:59.866
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO KNOW THAT

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:00.433
THEY CAN ADD THAT THAT THEY

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.901
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. WE'RE

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:03.770
WE'RE REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:06.239
WORK OUT WITH EDTA BECAUSE BACK

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:08.141
TO WHAT- WHAT DOES SENATOR

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:09.375
MITCHELL TALKED ABOUT AS WELL

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:11.344
WHICH IS. GOT POPS. AND

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:14.948
SPECIFICALLY BOTH ODI AND CD T.

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.149
ARE PART OF GULF POPS AND WE

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:17.550
REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:18.952
WITH YOU NEED TO TRY TO SOLVE

01:54:19.018 --> 01:54:21.187
THESE KINDS OF ISSUES- AND TO

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:23.022
REALLY ENVISION. WHAT THE MORE

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:24.457
TRANSFORMATIVE ELEMENTS FOR

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:25.825
THAT CLAIM AND EXPERIENCE COULD

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.160
BE LIKE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:29.495
TRYING TO DO THAT. AS WELL AND-

01:54:29.562 --> 01:54:31.231
AND ALL OF THAT IS CRITICAL TO

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:33.066
BE ABLE TO REALLY REVOLUTIONIZE

01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:34.601
WHAT PEOPLE NEED BECAUSE-

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.336
ULTIMATELY WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:37.971
IS THEY'RE HURTING THEY NEED

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:38.871
THEIR MONEY FROM THE STATE OF

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:40.573
CALIFORNIA. HOW QUICKLY CAN WE

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.178
GET IT TO THEM. HOW CAN WE BE

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:46.079
VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHICH PARTS OF

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:46.779
POLICIES AND FOR. WE CAN FLEX

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:49.682
ON BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY VERY.

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:50.583
DIFFICULT TIMES FOR A LOT OF

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.418
PEOPLE. BUT OF COURSE IT'S SO

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:54.354
IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE WE WISH

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.955
YOU ARE THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:58.291
FOR A LOT OF THESE THINGS. AND

01:54:58.358 --> 01:54:59.192
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:02.195
HAVE- TRUST. IN GOVERNMENT

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:03.796
RIGHT NOW IT'S BEEN A REAL

01:55:03.863 --> 01:55:06.633
CHALLENGE ON. EVERY LEVEL OF

01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:08.468
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SAID

01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:11.304
WE WON'T GO INTO BUT- I. IN

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.273
THAT LINE OF. THINKING AND

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:14.374
QUESTIONING DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.708
IDEA HOW OTHER STATES

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:17.510
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEMS

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:19.178
FACED WITH THE- THE MASSIVE

01:55:19.245 --> 01:55:20.847
INCREASE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT ON

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:22.949
BY THE PANDEMIC. I HAVE FARED

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:26.119
IN COMPARISON TO OURS- HOW HOW

01:55:26.185 --> 01:55:27.887
THERE WAS A BACKLOG COMPARING

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:30.023
TO A LARGE THE- AVERAGE TIME

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:32.158
BETWEEN RECEIPT OF A CLAIM- AND

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:34.427
PAYMENT OF A CLAIM AND- OTHER

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:35.461
PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS THAT ARE

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:37.363
BEING- WITHIN SOME STATED

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.332
PERIOD OF TIME DIDN'T. HAVE YOU

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:43.436
HAVE YOU LOOKED. AT THAT DO YOU

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:44.037
HAVE ANY DATA YOU CAN SHARE.

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:45.138
HEY THIS IS MARIE'S SUMMER I

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:46.639
CAN A LITTLE BIT WITH THEM WHEN

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:47.840
THEY'RE THERE ARE THE GENERAL.

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:49.275
DIFFICULT TO COMPARE RIGHT NOW

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:51.544
BECAUSE- YOU I CLAIMS THAT IN A

01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:54.847
WAY THAT ARE VERY. VOLATILE BUT

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.949
THERE ARE SOME BASIC MEASURES

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:57.517
THAT A COUPLE GROUPS TO PUT

01:55:57.583 --> 01:56:00.119
TOGETHER- THAT LOOK OUT LOOK AT

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.688
THE PERCENT OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:04.590
BEEN PROCESSED BY STATES SINCE

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:05.658
CORBETT. AND WE RANK I BELIEVE

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:06.626
LAST TIME I LOOKED AT THE

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:07.327
NUMBERS WERE UP AROUND

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:10.330
FOURTEEN. SO WE'RE DOING PRETTY

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:14.180
WHILE SOME OF THEM MAY BE STILL

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:15.982
COMPLEX I MEAN I DON'T

PARTICULARLY THE ONES WITH THE

02:09:09.274 --> 02:09:11.477
MOST EXPERIENCE AND SO I

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:13.245
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:14.079
IS THE TIME FOR THEM TO BE

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:15.280

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:17.716
BACKLOG AND- BUT- UNTIL THEY

SO- BUT I DO THINK THIS IS

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:36.034
SOMETHING WE NEED TO- WHEN WE

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.336
AS WE CAN CORPORATE LESSONS

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:39.605

REALLY RE UP TO. IN CRISIS I

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:02.895
THINK THAT'S WHY OF THINGS WE-

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:05.564

SORT OF VIOLENCE A SITTING

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.749
AROUND ABOUT SITTING AROUND

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:24.917
BUT- SAYING LIKE OH WELL LOOK

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:26.418

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.631
PEOPLE GET HURT WHEN THAT

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:42.134
HAPPENS. SO I HOPE THAT DOES

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.235
YOU KNOW SAID WE HAVE THE Q.

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:44.736
PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:45.571
ALSO THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:46.905
LONG TERM. AND THAT WE'RE

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:48.774
THINKING ABOUT THAT SO AGAIN I

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:10.229
S. IN INDEED D. THAT. THIS OF.

02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:12.931
IS IT IS. DEFINITELY SOMETHING

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.600
THAT IS SENATOR JACKSON. ABOUT

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.768
CALIFORNIA CAN LEGION- WE HAVE

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:17.869
NOT NLY BEEN HISTORY EVEN IF

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:19.438
SHE SHOULD WE HAVE US REAL

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:22.741
HISTORY AND- TECHNOLOGY- AND

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.343
YES PEOPLE ARE AT THE CENTER OF

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:25.310
THE CALIFORNIANS ARE AT THE

02:11:25.377 --> 02:11:26.812
CENTER. OF THAT WHAT DO THEY

02:11:26.878 --> 02:11:27.546
NEED TO HAVE A GREAT

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:29.581
EXPERIENCE. THAT IS NOT JUST

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:30.649
FOR THE CALIFORNIANS I THINK

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:32.951
THAT WE TYPICALLY. LOOK AT AS

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:34.286
BEING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE.

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.688
MAINSTREAM IT ALSO INCLUDES THE

02:11:36.755 --> 02:11:37.789
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:38.924
UNDERPRIVILEGED THE

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:39.758
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:41.126
DISADVANTAGED. AND THE

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:44.129
CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED MORE JUST

02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:46.164
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE KINDS

02:11:46.231 --> 02:11:48.600
OF SERVICES. THAT ARE THAT WAY.

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:49.901
WE NEED THEM TO BE ABLE TO

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:51.703
ACCESS. SO THERE'S A PART OF

02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:53.005
THAT WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.507
BRING- THE LENS OF EQUITY. WE

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:57.376
HAVE TO BRING THE LANDS OF

02:11:57.442 --> 02:11:59.244
UNDERSTANDING AND HOW DO WE

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:00.912
INTEGRATE THAT INTO OUR-

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:03.682
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. SO THAT

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.150
THEY CAN BE ACCESSED BY

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:06.752
EVERYBODY BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:09.154
SERVE THEM BETTER- THERE'S ALSO

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:13.058
A BIG PART OF IT AND SECRETARY-

ADDRESS THIS AS- DID DIRECTOR

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:16.995
TOM JUST NOW. WHICH IS THAT AT

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.030
BAT THE EFFORT OF

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:21.400
MODERNIZATION. AND THE EFFORT

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:22.334
TO TRY TO GET OUR TECHNOLOGY

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:25.003
SYSTEMS. HOW TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:27.539
FLEXIBLE TO BE ADAPTABLE TO BE

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:29.641
RESILIENT. REQUIRES THAT WE

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:30.909
START LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:32.644
THAT MAY HAVE NOT BEEN.

02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:34.646
CONSIDERED BEFORE HI AND WE

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:35.847
HAVE TO DO IT IN A DIFFERENT

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:37.049
WAY WITH THE CHANCE WE THINK

02:12:37.115 --> 02:12:38.750
ABOUT PROCUREMENT THE WAY THAT

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:39.551
WE THINK ABOUT SCOPING

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:42.788
PROBLEMS. AND EVEN D. THE-

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.589
PROJECTS THAT WE END UP

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:45.691
CHARTERING SO THAT THEY ARE

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:46.858
VERY FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT

02:12:46.925 --> 02:12:48.960
PROBLEMS- THAT CENTER JACKSON.

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:51.196
TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT-

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.130
THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATE

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:53.432
AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:55.634
FORWARD WITH THAT IDEA OF

02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:57.302
SPECIFIC. SERVICES THAT WE CAN

02:12:57.369 --> 02:13:03.909
PEEL OFF. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:04.476
CONFIRMATION THAT'S THAT WE

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:05.277
WERE ON THE TRACK WE STRIKE.

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.446
AROUND I DO ME STAY LIKE FLOOR

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:09.247
IMPLY. I MEET SAY THIS IS ISSUE

AND WE THINK THAT THIS CAN HELP

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:11.450
ADDRESS THIS THE SOCIAL.

THE VA IMPLEMENTING ID ME

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:19.491
BECAUSE IT'S A TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:21.927
COULD BE USEFUL SO WE'RE

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:22.427
LOOKING AT IT BOTH FROM

02:13:22.494 --> 02:13:24.363
STANDPOINT OF THE TECHNOLOGY.

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:26.198
THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE BUT HOW

02:13:26.264 --> 02:13:27.499
WE CAN REALLY SOLVE AND

02:13:27.566 --> 02:13:29.468
ADDRESSED BOTH CALIFORNIANS

NEEDS AS WELL AS MAKE THE

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.604

MEET ID ME WORK DO. DO THEY

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:55.060
HAVE ACCESS TO EDIE'S- SYSTEMS

02:13:55.127 --> 02:13:57.262
AT ALL IN THE PROCESS NO IT

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:59.698
DOESN'T I DO ME IS A THINK OF

02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:02.868
IT IT'S A- A FRIEND AND- JUST A

02:14:02.934 --> 02:14:05.604
STAND ALONE IN. OUR SYSTEM- FOR

02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:07.706
THE PURPOSES OF- VALIDATING

02:14:07.773 --> 02:14:11.042
INDIVIDUALS IDENTITY ONLY AND

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:13.211
IT DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION-

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:15.147
TO THE E. B. U. Y. SYSTEM FOR

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.816
THE REST OF THE CLAIMED-

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:21.086
INFORMATION- SO I COULD GO INTO

02:14:21.153 --> 02:14:23.622
A LITTLE BIT OF A- HOW THAT.

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.957
PROCESS WORKS OR EVEN IF THAT

02:14:26.024 --> 02:14:27.225
WAS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS YOUR

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:28.059
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

02:14:28.126 --> 02:14:28.927
HELPFUL BECAUSE WHAT I'M

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:30.862
LOOKING AT IS WHAT- WHAT

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:32.597
HAPPENS IF THEY DETERMINE WHEN

02:14:32.664 --> 02:14:34.666
THEY DO THEIR VERIFICATION THAT

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:36.468
THEY FIND THAT THERE'S- THERE'S

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:37.903
A PROBLEM WITH THE SOCIAL

02:14:37.969 --> 02:14:39.237
SECURITY NUMBER DOESN'T MATCH

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:40.539

MAKE THIS WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.977
POINT- INTO THE SHARE THAT

SHERATON WITHEDT AND WHAT

02:14:53.318 --> 02:14:54.853
ACTION IS TAKEN AFTER THAT.

THERE THERE IS A SEPARATION OF

02:15:03.862 --> 02:15:05.530
WHAT INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:08.567
CHECKING AGAINST- SO BASICALLY

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:32.277
WHAT HAVE ACCESS TO IT IT FOR

02:17:32.344 --> 02:17:34.412
THEIR OWN SPECIFIC DATA. ROUND

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:36.514
IF THAT NEEDS TO BE I SEE IN

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:37.849
WHICH YOU INDICATED EARLIER

02:17:37.916 --> 02:17:41.820
THAT 30% OR 70% IS THE HERO OF

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:43.655
SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED THROUGH

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.523
THE PROCESS. SO THAT LEAVES OF

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:48.059
ISSUE 30% THAT MAY BE AND I

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:49.027
THINK THE COMMENT WAS THAT

02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:51.529
THOSE COULD BE OR COULD BE

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:54.099
YOU'RE PROBABLY ARE FRAUDULENT-

02:17:54.165 --> 02:18:02.907
AND IF THAT'S THE. CASE AND-

02:18:02.974 --> 02:18:05.243
THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:06.578
VERIFY THERE FOR THIS IS I

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:08.013
GUESS. FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEY

02:18:08.079 --> 02:18:09.614
GO IN THEY HAVE IT OR TRY TO.

02:18:09.681 --> 02:18:11.549
LOOK FOR AND SOME OTHER WAY BUT

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:14.352
IF THAT'S 30% FRAUD. THE HOW

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:15.887
DOES THAT IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.689
THAT TO THE END TO THE-

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:19.658
PROCESSES UP TO OCTOBER FIFTH

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:24.062
WHEN. I ID NEEDS STARTED- DO

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:27.499
HAVE WE ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:30.035
FRAUD THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. IN

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:32.003
THE SYSTEM SINCE THAT TIME AND

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:33.204
I DON'T MEAN THAT TO SAY THAT I

02:18:33.271 --> 02:18:35.740
JUST. LIVE BY LIVE IN SOUTH

02:18:35.807 --> 02:18:37.909
SACRAMENTO. YEAH I HAVE AN ID I

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:39.077
DON'T LIVE IN SACRAMENTO BUT I

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:40.578
HAVE A PLACE IN SACRAMENTO HOME

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:41.980
IN SACRAMENTO AND I HAVEN'T

02:18:42.047 --> 02:18:42.681
BEEN THERE IN A MONTH AND I

02:18:42.747 --> 02:18:45.016
WENT AND I. JUST RECEIVED- I

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:47.052
HAVE PROBABLY A DOZEN LETTERS.

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:50.288
FROM ET DE COLD ADDRESSED TO

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:52.757
DIFFERENT PEOPLE- THAT LAST I

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:54.426
CHECKED THE LIVE IN MY HOUSE

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.861
SO- THESE SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:58.463
I WILL GET THEM TO EAT HE

02:18:58.530 --> 02:18:59.597
DEVOTED I DON'T THIS IS THE

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:00.799
INDICATION THIS IS HAPPENING

02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:03.234
ALL OVER THE STATE. BUT IT HAS

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:04.636
THERE BEEN AN ESTIMATE AND I

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:05.203
KNOW THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED

02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:06.538
LAST WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:08.440
COMMITTEE. AN ESTIMATION AS TO

02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:09.874
HOW MUCH FRAUD THERE IS ENOUGH

02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:11.776
WORK ARE WE CONSIDERING 30% OF

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:15.480
THOSE APPLICANTS- WERE

02:19:15.547 --> 02:19:16.815
FRAUDULENT BEFORE SO I.

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:18.183
PROBABLY HAVE THE BACK TO EDT

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:20.051
US BUT- ADDRESSED HOW MUCH

02:19:20.118 --> 02:19:21.886
PERSON WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:23.455
OF CURRENT CLAIMANT. OF

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.657
CLEARING CURRENT FLAME SORRY IN

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:26.925
THE SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE A

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:29.461
TRIBUTE TO FRAUD- BUT ON THE

02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:31.696
NEW CLAIMS ARE COMING IN SINCE.

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:34.165
THE ID ME WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED I

02:19:34.232 --> 02:19:36.034
WOULD NOT GO AS FAR AS THEY ALL

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:37.702
30% OF THEM ARE FRAUD BECAUSE

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:40.805
THERE ARE- CLOSE TO I BELIEVE

02:19:40.872 --> 02:19:42.006
LAST TIME WE CHECKED ABOUT TWO

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:44.876
THOUSAND. INDIVIDUAL THAT 30%

02:19:44.943 --> 02:19:46.144
OF CALL AND SAY HEY ARE THERE

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:47.679
OTHER WAYS SO THERE ARE.

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:49.347
LEGITIMATE CLAIM AND I JUST

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:51.683
NEED EXTRA HELP TO GET THROUGH-

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:53.384
I THINK THE LATEST ANALYSIS

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:54.853
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS PROBABLY

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:57.989
AROUND 18220% OFF SO. THAT OUR

02:19:58.056 --> 02:19:59.924
FULL STOP NEVER FOLLOW UP. THAT

02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:01.726
JUST NEVER FINISH THE PROCESS

02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:03.628
SO THOSE ARE GOOD INDICATORS.

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:04.996
ALTHOUGH NOT DEFINITIVE THOSE

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:06.464
AREN'T GOOD INDICATORS ARE

02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:08.900
FRAUDULENT IN. ANY OF THAT HAS

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:12.637
ANY CORRELATION. OF THE NUMBERS

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:16.307
OF ATTEMPTS. FOR PEOPLE TO TRY

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:16.941
TO GET IN AND THE STOP OF THE-

02:20:17.008 --> 02:20:20.011
DOOR IF THAT'S- COURT. TO MANY.

02:20:20.078 --> 02:20:20.879
FRAUDULENT TO HAVE A MADE IT

02:20:20.945 --> 02:20:22.413
THROUGH THE SYSTEM PRIOR TO ON

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.082
A TEAMMATE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE.

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:26.851
ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION- TO BE

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:28.987
DONE BY EDT TO A PROVIDER

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:31.156
NUMBER. OKAY ANALYSTS THAT WHEN

02:20:31.222 --> 02:20:32.157
IT WHEN I GET TO I DO HAVE SOME

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:33.892
QUESTIONS REDUCE ALL ASK THEM

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:34.492
WHEN WE GET TO BECAUSE I DID

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:35.827
WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH. WITH

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:37.729
YOU MISS DIRECTOR TOM. A LITTLE

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:41.266
MORE. ON THAT- IT MAINLY THAT

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:43.434
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 18220% OF

02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:44.869
THOSE DOLLARS IN THAT FRAUD.

02:20:44.936 --> 02:20:46.938
YOU KNOW WHAT HOW WHY THAT'S SO

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:47.539
IMPORTANT AS THOSE ARE DOLLARS

02:20:47.605 --> 02:20:49.240
THAT COULD BE USED AT SOME

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:50.909
POINT FOR THOSE BENEFITS THAT

02:20:50.975 --> 02:20:52.343
THE- THOSE THAT REALLY NEED IT

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:53.745
AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:54.412
THERE FOR THOSE THAT ARE

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:56.114
STRUGGLING SO MUCH. I GUESS

WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:00.752
TECHNOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT THOSE

02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:02.420
I. T. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

02:21:02.487 --> 02:21:03.855

CLOSELY NOW AND. IS THAT AN

02:21:16.167 --> 02:21:17.535
ONGOING RELATIONSHIP YES I

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:19.204
WOULD I WAS SAY THAT WITH

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:21.206
INNING GAME. OF THE STRIKE TEAM

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:23.341
THE RELATIONS IS TO THE DEGREE

HAVE THIS IMPLEMENT EARLIER

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:32.911
WITHOUT MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:35.246
WHAT I CAN RESPOND TO- SENATOR

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:37.115
HILL IS THE FACT THAT. THIS WAS

02:22:37.181 --> 02:22:38.883
VERY MUCH THIS RECOMMENDATION

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.752
FIRST OF ALL TO DO IT IDENTITY

02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:45.290
VERIFICATION AUTOMATION IS VERY

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:46.057
MUCH BASED ON THE- US TEAMS

02:22:46.124 --> 02:22:48.326
ASSESS. AND THERE WAS GOOD

02:22:48.393 --> 02:22:50.161

BIGGEST BOTTLENECK IS. AND IT

02:22:59.404 --> 02:23:00.738
WAS THROUGH THAT DATA IT WAS

02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:02.607
VALIDATED BUT THE BIGGEST

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:04.008
BOTTLENECK AT THE VERY VERY

02:23:04.075 --> 02:23:06.010
FIRST IF THAT ENTITY

02:23:06.077 --> 02:23:07.345
VERIFICATION AND BECAUSE OF

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:11.316
THAT. THE AUTOMATION WAS

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:12.750
RECOMMENDED. OKAY IT I GUESS IN

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:14.585

THAT THE STRIKE TEAM WAS.

02:23:29.467 --> 02:23:31.569
LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT A

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:34.472
SPECIALLY RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY.

02:23:34.539 --> 02:23:37.909
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO AND- YOU

CHANCE FORM FOR MULTIPLE LEVEL

02:23:44.916 --> 02:23:46.184
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY BEING ONE

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.852
ASPECT OF IT BUT THE BUTTHE

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.754
POLICY THE OPERATION THE

PROCEDURE SIDE OF IT ALSO NEED

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:53.458
TO BE. REVISITED THE STRIKING

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:54.659
REPORTER HAVE STRIKE THAT

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:56.928
BALANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.863
MODERNIZATION IS NOT PURELY IN

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:01.032
TECHNOLOGY AND THEREFORE. A

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:03.401
VERY SLOW SYNC A ROADMAP. FOR

02:24:03.468 --> 02:24:05.103
