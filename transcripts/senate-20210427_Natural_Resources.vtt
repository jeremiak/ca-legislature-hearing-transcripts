ASK. A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR-

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.882
THE BILL SETS FORTH A STATE

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:46.617
CONTRIBUTION AND THEN ALSO

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.819
THERE'S A FEDERAL ONE AND THEN

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.687
THERE'S LOCAL. DOES THE BILL

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.756
MAKE THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.758
CONTINGENT ON THE OTHER TO

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:59.096

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:03.567
BUT I WILL REFER TO MY EXPERT-

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.602
WHAT DOES HERE IN THE ROOM.

EXPERT WITNESS- YES THAT'S MY

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:17.614

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.721
CONSULTANT SHAKING HIS HEAD SO

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:26.957

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.592
PRACTICE YOU EXPECTED TO BE

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.527

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.067
BUILD THAT THIS. IS I THINK

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.369

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.248
ANSWER SOMETIME. AFTER THIS

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:54.818
HEARING. AND THEN MY COMMENT

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.854
WAS GOING TO BE- FROM THIS WILL

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.922
BE A CONFUSING COMMENT BUT

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:00.190
FIRST PART ISN'T CONFUSING AT

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.959
ALL ARE YOU DOING A GREAT JOB

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.527
OF REPRESENTING YOUR DISTRICT

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:04.561
AND YOUR REGION AND

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:05.896
CONGRATULATIONS FOR THAT THEY

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:08.432
WERE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS AN

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:11.201
ADVOCATE. HARM IN UNFORTUNATELY

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.704
I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS AT

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:18.542
THE END SO. OF THE BIG CONCERN

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.611
I HAVE A FEW OF THEM. IS THAT

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:22.412
WE HAVE A HISTORIC BENEFICIARY

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:25.516
PAYS A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA-

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:28.285
WATER PROJECT ITSELF WAS 97%

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.354
PAID FOR BY THE WATER USERS AND

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.457
3% BY THE STATE TAX PAPERS.

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.125
EVEN TOUGH THERE WAS A SLIGHT

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:36.793
AMENDMENT TO THAT IN THE- IN

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.695
THE WATER BOND IN TWENTY

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:39.229
FOURTEEN WHERE THERE WAS A

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:43.000
DIFFERENCE WHAT FOR LAND. AND

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:44.902
THIS IS A LOGICAL THING FOR THE

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:48.972
USERS TO PAY BECAUSE AS WAS

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.474
SAID THIRTY ONE MILLION- BUT

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.409
PEOPLE ARE SERVED WATER FROM

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.578
THIS AND THREE MILLION. ACRES

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.713
OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE THAT

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.148
COULD BE SPREAD OUT AND AT A

00:46:58.215 --> 00:46:59.950
RELATIVELY LOW COST TO ALL OF

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:01.985
THEM OVER TIME AND CONTINUE THE

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.820
BENEFICIARY PAYS. AND I THINK

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.589
THE MARYLAND ISSUED DIVORCE

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:08.125
DEFEATED IN PART BECAUSE- THERE

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:10.460
WAS A BENEFICIARY PAYS. SORT OF

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:14.198
CHANGE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:16.833
THAT. AND THE- THERE'S ALSO

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.835
STATE MONEY GOING FOR FEDERAL

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.837
PROJECT WHICH I THINK IS IT IS

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:24.241
OF CONCERN. AND THIS BENEFITS A

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:26.310
SPECIFIC AREA SPECIFIC GROUP OF

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:28.612
PEOPLE BUT NOT EVERYBODY ALL

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:31.815
THE TAXPAYERS WILL DO IT AND

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:34.384
THE STATISTIC WAS CITED. OF THE

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.385
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT CAME

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.421
FROM CALIFORNIA MORE VERY LARGE

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:39.122
AMOUNT COME FROM MY DISTRICT TO

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:40.390
THE GENERAL REGION WHETHER IT'S

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:42.492
PART OF OUR THE SALINAS VALLEY

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:44.061
BUT THEY DO NOT IMPORT WATER

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.162
AND THEY WILL NOT GET A DIME

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:47.698
FROM THIS BILL SO IN MANY WAYS.

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.933
IT FAVORS ONE AGRICULTURAL AREA

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.469
OVER ANOTHER AND THE REASON WE

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.104
HAD A WATER BOND WAS TO MAKE

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:57.174
SURE EVERYBODY GOT A FAIR SHARE

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.077
NOT JUST A SELECT A PART OF THE

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.746
STATE OR FOR SELECT. WATER

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.915
USERS SAID. ARE USED TO HAVE

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:06.950
THIS RIFF WHAT I SAID WHEN I

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.285
WAS IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:10.587
MONTEREY AND SANTA CRUZ I SAID

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.089
WE'D HAVE TO CUT OUR SCHOOLS

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.991
AND CUT OUR HEALTH CARE AND PAY

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:15.759
A 100% FOR OUR WATER AND THEN

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:17.027
USE TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.862
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WELL. THEN FOR

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.430
EIGHT YEARS AS RESOURCES

00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:22.099
SECRETARY I SUPPORTED THAT AND

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:24.368
NOW I AM BACK. TO ADVOCATING

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:25.902
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.972
WANTED TO GET. A FAIR SHARE OR

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:32.743
SO UP FROM THAT IS OF CONCERN

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.745
AND I KNOW THAT I GOT A PUSH

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.680
BACK IN THE- SOME OF THE

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.615
LOBBYING VISITS BY THIS WILL

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.117
BENEFIT THE STATE'S ECONOMY

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:41.685
BECAUSE OF SILICON VALLEY AND

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.520
THE AG SECTOR. BUT IF YOU'RE

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.122
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THAT IS

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:47.224
NOT SERVED BY STATE OR FEDERAL

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.126
WATER YOU WERE EVEN MORE

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:51.028
DISADVANTAGE FOR PAYING TAXES

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.796
AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING BACK

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.565
AND SO. I BASICALLY WANT TO

00:48:55.632 --> 00:48:57.134
GIVE THE AUTHOR CHANGED HER TO

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.269
WORK ON THIS AND SEE IF MAYBE

00:48:59.336 --> 00:48:59.803
THERE'S AN AMENDMENT ABOUT

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.838
CONTINGENCY AND SEE IF THERE'S

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.473
ANYTHING IN IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.975
IN THE STATE I'M GOING TO VOTE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.743
TO MOVE THIS ALONG BUT I HAVE

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.445
THOSE CONCERNS AND I REALLY

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:14.584
WANTED TO. WIPE. THEM OUT TO

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.787
SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY. ARE THE

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:19.156
TO TAKE BE. SO I JUST OBLIGATED

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:23.193
TO ME THAT STATEMENT. OTHER COM-

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.528
SENATORS ON STORAGE ANDERSON

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:52.242
BEEN NEGLECTED FOR. BASICALLY

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:56.012
THE ENTIRE. BOB THE EXISTENCE

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:56.546
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.248
SINCE EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WE'VE

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:01.084
BEEN DIPPING INTO THAT AQUIFER

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.318
FOR SO LONG THAT IT TO THE

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:04.320
SUBSIDENCE IS NOT CREATE CREATE

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:05.388
DAMAGE BUT NOW WE'RE MANAGING

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.357
THAT. WERE ACTUALLY PAYING

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.425
FARMERS TO FLOOD THEIR FIELDS.

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:11.828
SO THAT THE WATER COULD. SEEP

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:14.764
INTO THE AQUIFER AND BATTLE.

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.399
THE ONGOING SUBSIDENCE IS

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:17.167
CURRENTLY THREATENING THE

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.601
VALLEY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:20.637
POLICY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.106
TOWARD THIS END. IF WE CAN.

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:26.543
ARREST SUBSIDENCE ANY FURTHER.

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.377
WE CAN START TO MAKE

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:30.180
INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM AND-

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.382
THAT IT'LL BE WANT ONE TIME AND

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:34.651
INVESTMENT AND THAT THIS WILL

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:37.787
NOT CONTINUE FURTHER SO I THINK

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:38.388
A COMBINATION WITH WHAT WE'VE

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:41.758
DONE. WE HAVE A LOT OF A VERY

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.860
STRONG A VERY SOLID GROUND TO

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.929
STAND ON TO REQUEST MORE MONEY

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.630
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:48.765
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.567
ADD THAT TO THE BILL OR AT

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.635
LEAST A- INTRODUCED A

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:57.574
RESOLUTION- OF A RESOLUTION TO-

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.409
ASKING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO-

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:03.146
THAT. FUND THIS ISSUE I THINK

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:05.448
TRILLIONS ARE BEING RAISED IT

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.483
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WHAT

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:08.618
I'M HEARING FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.420
WORKING ON AN ECONOMIC PACKAGE

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.155
THAT WILL BRING MONEY TO FUND

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:13.857
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.625
SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE LIST AND-

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.760
AND WE SHOULD- ADD THIS PROJECT

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:18.628
TO THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.029
PROJECTS FOR THAT FUNDING

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:20.997
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:22.565
ACT TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:25.268
SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE BILL. SO

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:25.835
THAT THEY COULD FIND A MAJOR

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:28.204
PORTION OF THIS BAND AND GIVE

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:31.241
SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:32.609
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:34.010
BRING SOME OF THIS MONEY THERE

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:34.911
SHOULD BE SOME ADJUSTMENT TO

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:36.779
ALLOW THAT. MONEY TO COME IN

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.248
AND SAVE THE STATE'S OF MONEY

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:41.050
BECAUSE WE- THE FEDERAL

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.652
GOVERNMENT'S ASSISTANCE AND WE

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.120
NEED TO ADD SOME OF THAT MONEY

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.489
COME BACK TO THE STATE SO. ONE

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:47.223
ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.525
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AND I

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:50.493
THINK THIS WILL THIS BILL

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.561
REALLY NEEDS TO STAY ALIVE AND

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.596
MOVED FORWARD AND- AND USE THAT

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.798
AS A- AS A MEANS OF

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.166
COMMUNICATING WITH OUR FEDERAL

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:59.335

INVOLVED BECAUSE THIS IS

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:02.272
IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THE STATE

ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE- HE

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:27.697
SAID TEN YEARS BUT I BELIEVE

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:30.833
IT'S OVER A DECADE- AND IT IS

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.102
VERY FRUSTRATING. THAT WE STILL

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.604
CAN'T PROVIDE WATER TO THE

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.639
CENTRAL VALLEY. I UNDERSTAND

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.775
THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT-

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.543
NEARLY ENTIRE STATE PAYING FOR

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.145
THIS BUT I DISAGREE WITH THE

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:46.049
TEACHER'S COMMENTS ABOUT- ONLY

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:46.816
THE CENTRAL VALLEY BENEFITS

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.952
FROM THIS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:50.353
IS THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.988
COUNTIES IN THE WORLD NOT IN

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.923
THE NATION NONE OF THE STATE IN

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.859
THE WORLD. AND THESE AND WHEN

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:59.562
YOU SAID THAT WE ARE AND- YOU

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.230
IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THAT

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:01.831
WE COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF A

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.700
FOOD CRISIS. WE VERY WELL COULD

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.601
BE ON THE VERGE OF A FOOD

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.770
CRISIS THAT IS NOT DRAMATIC-

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:08.972
THERE ARE NONE SEVERAL

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.174
COMMODITIES- BASED ON AND

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.243
CALIFORNIA'S- THE FOOD AND DRUG

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.445
OR THE FOOD AND DRUG

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.013
ADMINISTRATION THAT. HAS BEEN

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:17.880
PUT OUT THAT SEVERAL

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:18.982
COMMODITIES IN THE CENTRAL

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:21.384
VALLEY WE PRODUCE 99% OF THEM

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:25.121
IN THE WORLD. THAT MEANS THAT-

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.523
IF THESE COMMODITIES GO AWAY.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.193
AT THOSE IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.728
GET THOSE THINGS AND I BELIEVE-

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.963
ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS- AS

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.298

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.900
PISTACHIOS CUTIES KIWIS.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.236
CARROTS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.138
AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT IS PRODUCED

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.473
THAT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.008
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE NATION

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.743
THE WORLD BENEFIT FROM. SO I

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:50.046
DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A BENEFIT

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:50.747
TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ALSO

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:51.481
GIVEN MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THIS

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.716
TAKING SO LONG AND- IT TRULY IS

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.418
A BIPARTISAN ISSUE A LIKE I

IS ALREADY BEEN ATTRIBUTED.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:11.968
PRESIDENT BIDEN DIANNE

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.170
FEINSTEIN JIM COSTA KEVIN

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.439
MCCARTHY THIS TRULY IS A

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.641
BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND IT'S

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:19.842
AMAZING TO ME WITH ALL THESE

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.677
POWERFUL PEOPLE THAT. HAVE THE

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.146
OPPORTUNITY ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.580
THE AISLE TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.215
SITUATION THAT WE CAN'T EVER

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.551
SEEM TO GET IT DONE. M. SO

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.053
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING GOING

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.854
ON THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE AT.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:34.624
THIS BILL- APPROPRIATES-

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.691
THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S MONEY

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.260
THAT NOT JUST A FRANK CURRENT

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.128
CANAL CORRECT THERE IS FOR

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.596
CANALS THAT ARE BEING FIXED

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.899
WITH THIS. INCLUDING THE DELTA

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.768
MENDOTA- SUBSIDENCE ISSUE IN

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:46.769
THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THERE

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:50.606
AND THEN ALSO. WITH THE

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:51.307
CALIFORNIA AQUIDNECK- THERE IS

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.409
A THE SIZE ISSUE WE HAVE THE

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.611
ABILITY TO DELIVER WATER- IS

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.680
THE MECHANISM IS THERE IT JUST

01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:00.550
HAS BEEN NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.150
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.585
YOUR BILL SOLVES THAT. IN YOUR

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:03.453
BILL SOLVES A VERY

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.455
STRATEGICALLY FROM ONE THIRD-

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:06.789
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:07.690
ONE THIRD OF THE RESOURCES

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.592
COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:10.193
GOVERNMENT AND ONE THIRD FROM

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.961
THE END USERS. I HAVE TO TELL

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:13.096
YOU THAT THE END USERS ARE

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.864
TAKING A HUGE RISK AGAIN AND

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.365
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT. THE

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.835
END USERS PAID FOR- AGREED TO

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.670
THE WATER BOND THEY PAID FOR

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:22.371
AND THEY'RE PAYING FOR MORE

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.607
WATER NOW. AND THEN IS BEING

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.209
DELIVERED. IT'S LIKE GOING TO A

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.477
GROCERY STORE IN PUTTING A

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:27.977
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.445
GROCERIES ON THE BELT. AND

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.580
WALKING OUT OF THE STORE OF TO

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.015
PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH TEN

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.017
DOLLARS WORTH OF A PRODUCT. AND

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:35.985
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.553
OUR END USERS THEY'RE PAYING

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.821
FOR WATER THAT THEY NO LONGER

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.656
GET. AND SO THEY ARE TAKING A

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.291
RISK TO BE ABLE TO PUT UP THIS

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.893
THIRD. BUT I'M GLAD THAT

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.128
THEY'RE DOING IT AND THEY STILL

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.796
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.531
AND I THINK THAT TAKES SOMEONE

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.699
LIKE YOU TO BRING ALL THOSE

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.501
PARTIES TOGETHER. AM I KNOW YOU

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.768
HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OF THE

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.437
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PRIOR

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.404
ADMINISTRATION I AGREE

01:02:55.471 --> 01:03:05.815
RELATIONSHIPS. OF THE FEDERAL

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:06.449
GOVERNMENT YOU BROUGHT THEM HE-

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.049
YOU DO THAT NOW I HAVE TOLD.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:07.683
CONFIDENCE IN YOU TO DO THAT.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.651
AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE- I

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:09.352
REALLY DO BELIEVE. THAT THIS

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:09.919
COULD BE THE TO THAT WE CAN

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:11.487
ACTUALLY. GE THE SIX. FIX AND-

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:15.024
THAT AND- I. EVERY AT THE TABLE

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.993

THE STATE THE NATION EVEN THE

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.029
WORLD BENEFIT FROM S. FIXING

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:22.031
THIS PROBLEM. AGAIN I JUST WANT

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.167
TO EMPHASIZE. AND LET THAT SINK

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.768
IN A LITTLE BIT THE TOP THREE

YOU'VE- GOT A- SMARTER APPROACH

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.116
TO A COMPLICATED. AREA I THINK

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.051
YOU'VE EVEN OCULAR IN SOME OF

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.153

FACING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.793
CARBON SEQUESTRATION SPACE I

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.395
DON'T THINK BUT AS TENSIONS ARE

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.096
NECESSARILY GOING TO GO AWAY

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:16.598
BUT I THINK IT'S- IT'S THE

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.300
RIGHT THING TO DO TO JUST START

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:20.669
DOING THE MATH. AND PUT A

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.470
FRAMEWORK OUT THERE THAT WE CAN

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:23.638
BUILD ON SO I THINK THIS IS A

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.774
REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE VEHICLE AND

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.276

ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION. QUICKLY

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:04.312
THE- I SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:07.382
WE SEE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:10.785
ARE CLAIMING THAT THEY CAN-

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.454
ENGAGING CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.888
WE'VE NOT REALLY SEEN REAL

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.790
PROOF OF THAT AND SO BY NO

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.625
MEANS DO I WANT TO CREATE A

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:21.496
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD-

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:25.266
ALLOW FOR- QUESTIONABLE

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.868
TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN THIS

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.704
REGISTRY. AND IT IS ONE OF THE

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.039
REASONS I STATED THAT MY

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.307

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:35.043
GREENWASHING. AND THAT WHAT THE

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.280
REFERENCE IS SOMETHING CALLED

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:41.483
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE BUT DIRECT

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:44.619
AIR CAPTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.222
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE- AND

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:48.256
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.992
MUCH OF A DEMONSTRATION OF THAT

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.994
PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY BUT IT

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:56.331
MAY BE A VERY. VIABLE ONE AND

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.501
SO WE DON'T WANT TO- JUST KNOCK

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.070
IT OUT WITHOUT. IT WITHOUT IT

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.338
REALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:05.473
ITS POTENTIAL IS BUT IT IS A

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.809
DIFFERENT DAY AND CARBON

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.344
CAPTURE AND STORAGE. AND WITH

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.413

THE COASTAL COMMISSION STARKLY

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.192
HAS HAD LIMITED ABILITY TO

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:06.160
ENFORCE THE LAW. ORIGINALLY

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:07.328
ONLY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

AGAINST AN ENTITY FOR VIOLATING

IMPOSE MONETARY PENALTIES. THE

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:16.838
COURSE FOLLOWING THE MANY

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:19.674
REPORTS AND ANALYSES DONE BY

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:20.909
THE ALLEY- HIGHLIGHTING THE- A

CUMBERSOME PROCESS THAT RESULTS

IN FEW FINES AND PENALTIES

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.647

ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THE COURTS

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.618
IS THAT. THE ONLY- FINDING-

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.687
DEEMED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:33.821
COMMISSION WAS GRANTED LIMITED

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:34.556
AUTHORITY TO ISSUE

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:35.924
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.458
PUBLIC ACCESS VIOLATIONS ONLY

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.127
THIS IS THE PRO TIMES BUILT.

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:42.096
AND WAS ASKED TO REPORT BACK TO

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.364
THE LEGISLATURE. SINCE THEN THE

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:45.667
COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO WIN THE

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:48.269
SO PROGRAMS BUILT- AND SINCE

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:49.337
THEN THE COMMISSION'S ACTUALLY

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.538
BEEN ABLE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.073
RESOLVE PUBLIC ACCESS CASES THE

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.808
AVERAGE TIME REQUIRED TO CLOSE

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.543
THE CASE STRENGTH FROM THREE

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.345
YEARS TO THREE MONTHS. THE

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:58.513
INCENTIVE ACTUALLY WAS SO

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.415
STRONG THAT 95% OF CASES WERE

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.283
CLOSED BEFORE VOLUNTARY

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.352
COOPERATION 90% OF THOSE- WERE

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:05.954
WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES ISSUES

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:06.621
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.856
THAT FOLKS NEED TO. TO

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.392
RECOGNIZE- BUT HAVING. THE

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.027
ENFORCEMENT POWER. BROUGHT

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.629
PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IN A WAY

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.397
THAT THEY WEREN'T. COMING TO

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:18.533
THE TABLE BEFORE. AND AS I SAY

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.402
NINETY PERCENT. OF THE- OF THE

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:23.738
CASES WERE RESOLVED WITH

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.607
LITERALLY NO PENALTY ISSUE. SO

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.308
THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT. THIS

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.243
THREAT IS AN IS AN EFFECTIVE

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.878
TOOL FOR RESOLVING VIOLATIONS

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.581
WITHOUT LITIGATION- BUT ALSO

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:35.650
THERE'S THE TRACK RECORD SHOWS-

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:36.784
LEASE THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.852
THAT THE THAT THE COMMISSION

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.320
CAN WORK RESPONSIBLY WITH

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.289
LANDOWNERS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.658
FOR THE BENEFIT THE PUBLIC- YOU

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:46.227

THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:19.164
WITH FOR YEARS HERE WHERE-

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:22.301

FOR. OR OFFROAD VEHICLES HAVE

02:07:25.137 --> 02:07:27.606
BEEN GRADUALLY BEEN REDUCE

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:28.974
REDUCE REDUCE TO THE POINT

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:31.643
THAT- PEOPLE THAT DO WANNA

RECREATE WITH THEIR OFF ROAD

02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:34.546
VEHICLES HAVE REALLY KNOW WHERE

02:07:34.613 --> 02:07:38.250
TO GO- AND THIS OFTEN LEADS TO-

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:42.021
THE- PEOPLE USING THEIR

02:07:42.087 --> 02:07:43.489
VEHICLES ON ON SENSITIVE

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:47.760
HABITAT. AND AGAIN IT TO PUTS

02:07:47.826 --> 02:07:49.962
PUTS OUR OUR POLICE RESOURCES

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:52.331
OF OUR THE STATE'S ABILITY TO

02:07:52.398 --> 02:07:54.833
REALLY PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:57.102
MIX OF JUST MUCH HARDER. OF I

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:58.670
DON'T KNOW THAT I THOUGHT THAT

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.873
THIS BILL IS NECESSARILY A

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:03.075
CONCORDE THAT- THE PROCESS OF

02:08:03.142 --> 02:08:04.343
THE STATE ENGAGED ELIMINATE

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:06.612
THIS PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW IF IT

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:07.179
REALLY PUT A NUMBER OF PRICE

02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:09.782
TAG. ON ON WHAT BURDEN THIS

02:08:09.848 --> 02:08:11.583
WOULD PUT ON OUR STATE POLICING

02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:13.685
POWERS. AND ENSURING THAT WE

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:16.922
CAN. KEEP PEOPLE OFF OF SURFACE

02:08:16.989 --> 02:08:18.190
SENSITIVE HABITAT THAT'S

02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:19.591
ALREADY PROBLEM I THINK

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.093
ELIMINATING THIS PROGRAM WILL

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.695
JUST MAKE IT WORSE. AND I THINK

02:08:23.762 --> 02:08:28.300
WE HAVE TO FIND A SENSIBLE AREA.

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:30.235
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO RECREATE

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:32.471
EVEN IF THE I MEAN THE PAY

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:33.038
THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT UNDER

02:08:33.105 --> 02:08:34.840
THIS PROGRAM. IT'LL PROVIDE

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:36.475
AREAS WHERE THEY CAN RECREATE

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:38.544
SAFELY AND IN A WAY IT DOESN'T

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:41.346
DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO

02:08:41.413 --> 02:08:42.548
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS I

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:43.782
THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:45.484
WORKING ON I APPRECIATE THAT

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:47.352
THIS AUTHORS TAKEN. ON THIS

02:08:47.419 --> 02:08:49.354
DIFFICULT ISSUE THERE'S STRONG

02:08:49.421 --> 02:08:51.623
ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT I

02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:55.861
TEND TO- FALL ON THE SIDE OF.

02:08:55.928 --> 02:08:57.563
YOU KNOW THIS LOTS OF PEOPLE ON

02:08:57.629 --> 02:09:00.432
THESE VEHICLES THE SOLUTION

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:02.267
SHOULD ALWAYS BE. YOU HAVE TO

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:04.570
GO OUT AND BUY A NEW VEHICLE.

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:05.471
WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:08.841
GRADUALLY. MOVE PEOPLE INTO-

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:11.343
CLEANER VEHICLES. IN A WAY THAT

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:14.279
IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A FINANCE A

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:17.349
HUGE HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN. AND

02:09:17.416 --> 02:09:19.885
IT HAS SINCE THAT RULE WOULD

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:22.354
WOULD BRING AN END TO. A RIP

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:23.989
OFF ROAD VEHICLES IN ANY PART

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:26.658
OF THE STATE. AND THEN I THINK

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:27.826
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WILL FIGHT

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:29.728
THAT BY BASICALLY RIGHT IN

02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:31.697
THEIR VEHICLES ILLEGALLY IN

02:09:31.763 --> 02:09:33.298
SENSITIVE HABITAT AND IT'S

02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:35.167
GONNA- PROVIDE ENORMOUS COSTS

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:36.568
TO OUR STATE POLICE IN THAT

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:38.470
ACTIVITY AND- WE CAN FIND

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:39.938
COMMON GROUND I THINK THIS BILL

02:09:40.005 --> 02:09:45.410
ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT AND- IT'S

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:46.645
PART TO KEEP THIS PROGRAM

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:49.414
GOING. SOMEHOW IN A WAY THAT-

02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:54.887
THIS IS- THIS IS A LITTLE MORE

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:57.289
A REASONABLE AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:09:57.356 --> 02:10:00.792
BASICALLY ENDING THE USE AND

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:03.162
REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GO BY THE

02:10:03.228 --> 02:10:04.663
NEW VEHICLES AND THEN AND THEN

02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:07.032
HAVE TO. I DON'T UNDER THIS

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:09.468
PROGRAM WITH IT WILL WE- EVEN

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.203
IF THEY WILL EVEN BE ALLOWED TO

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:13.038
USE THEIR- RECREATIONAL

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.240
VEHICLES AND SENSITIVE I MEAN

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:17.276
AND CONTROLLED AREAS BECAUSE-

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:20.746
BASICALLY ELIMINATES PROGRAM SO-

I'M GONNA SPORTIST TODAY FROM

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:25.484
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO- SEE IF

02:10:25.551 --> 02:10:26.985
WE COULD FIND IF THIS BILL CAN

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:28.320
SOLVE THE CURRENT PROBLEM

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:31.190

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:53.191
THAT'S- THAT'S ONE OF THOSE

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:55.093
INVIOLABLE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.062
TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT- OVER

02:13:57.129 --> 02:13:58.663
WRITING AT BY STATUTE I THINK

02:13:58.730 --> 02:14:00.265
THE EXISTING REGULATORY PROCESS

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:01.366
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THAT

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:03.235
SO. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T BE

02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:04.736

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:07.739

WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.664
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ONE OF THE

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.266
THINGS OPPOSITION CONTINUES TO

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:35.634
SAY THIS IS A AN EXPANDED

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.868
PROGRAM AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:38.103
THEY'RE COMING FROM AND THAT.

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:39.237
YOU KNOW CARP HAS ELIMINATED

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:41.306
THIS AND SO NOW KEEPING A GOING

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.141
IN AT ANY LEVELS AN EXPANSION

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:44.843
IT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WERE. WERE

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.711
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:49.281
REGISTERED EACH YEAR FROM

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:49.848
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:51.016
HUNDRED. AND THOSE

02:14:51.082 --> 02:14:51.817
REGISTRATIONS HAVE TO BE FROM

02:14:51.883 --> 02:14:55.020
LEGITIMATE- COMPETITIVE. RACERS

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.388
THAT ARE ARE PART OF A

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:58.924
LEGITIMATE RACING ORGANIZATION.

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:00.725
AND SO THERE IS SOME-

02:15:00.792 --> 02:15:03.295
REGULATION THERE- SPEAKING TO

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:05.163
THE ERROR- QUALITY OF THESE

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.331
MORE CYCLES I THINK THE

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:08.099
ARGUMENT WAS MADE THAT- THERE

02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:09.100
ANYWHERE FROM ONE AND A HALF

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:10.836
TIMES MORE POLLUTING TO TWO AND

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:11.503
A HALF TIMES MORE POLLUTING

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:13.538
PER. VEHICLE AND I DON'T KNOW

02:15:13.605 --> 02:15:14.840
IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT IT BUT

02:15:14.906 --> 02:15:17.609
LET'S ASSUME THAT IT IS- THE

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:19.044
GOOD NEWS ABOUT THIS BILL AGAIN

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.612
AS WERE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:23.515
VEHICLES BY 93% SO OVERALL

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:25.217
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NET.

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:28.620
DECREASE IN THE- EMISSIONS FROM

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:30.455
THESE VEHICLES. ARE ONE OF THE

02:15:30.522 --> 02:15:32.858
OTHER. ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE

02:15:32.924 --> 02:15:35.160
OPPOSITION. THAT I ACTUALLY

02:15:35.227 --> 02:15:36.261
SUPPORT I THINK SUPPORTS TO

02:15:36.328 --> 02:15:37.562
BILLS IF WE DON'T HAVE A

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:39.498
PROGRAM THEN. THESE FOLKS STILL

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:41.333
HAVE ACCESS TO. PRIVATE LANDS

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:42.767
IN CAN RACE ON PRIVATE LANDS

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:43.835
INTO THE PRACTICE SOME PROBLEMS

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:46.805
RIGHT THAT'S TRUE- BUT ANYMORE

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:49.875
ON REGULATED- ENVIRONMENT AND

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:50.909
THEN WHAT WOULD BE WHAT DOES

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:52.310
THIS BILL ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATES

02:15:52.377 --> 02:15:55.413
MORE REGULATION. THAN THAT

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:57.782
SCENARIO CONTEMPLATES IN THAT

02:15:57.849 --> 02:15:59.518
THE TO BE REGISTERED IN THIS

02:15:59.584 --> 02:16:01.052
NEW PROGRAM THE VEHICLES HAVE

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:02.521
TO SPARK ARRESTORS AFTER

02:16:02.587 --> 02:16:03.788
MUFFLERS. YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:05.624
OTHER SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAT ARE

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:08.994
REQUIRED. AND SO THE GOAL OF

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:10.896
THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY TO

02:16:10.962 --> 02:16:12.764
MAINTAIN ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS

02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:14.833
SO THAT THESE. RACERS AND THESE

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.434
COMPETITORS WANT TO HAVE A

02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:18.270
VEHICLE THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH

02:16:18.336 --> 02:16:19.938
THIS PROGRAM. AND IS ACTUALLY

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:21.473
SAFER THAN IF WE HAVE NO

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:25.243
PROGRAM. SO I'M HOPING THAT

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:27.178
THAT WILL- SPEAK TO SOME THE

02:16:27.245 --> 02:16:30.215
OPPOSITION CONCERNS. THIS IS A

02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:31.650
MUCH NEEDED REPLACEMENT

02:16:31.716 --> 02:16:33.652

HUNDRED FROM SEVENTY FIVE

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:45.964
HUNDRED AND THEY HAVE TO BE

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:47.832

02:33:43.948 --> 02:33:45.916
MERICAN JOBS PLANNED.

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:48.519
HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF UNION

02:33:48.586 --> 02:33:50.821
LABOR IN IN DOING THIS WORK-

02:33:50.888 --> 02:33:52.856
THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:53.991
BATTLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

02:33:54.058 --> 02:33:55.659
THERE'S THREE PARTS TO THE

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:58.395
LEGISLATION ONE IS THE

02:33:58.462 --> 02:34:00.631
ACCELERATING OUR MITIGATION

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:04.435
PATH OR TRAJECTORY TOWARDS

02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:05.769
TWENTY THIRTY- ONE IS THE

02:34:05.836 --> 02:34:07.471
CLIMATE. FRAMEWORK IS YOUR

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.772
WHICH IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF

02:34:08.839 --> 02:34:10.774
THE BILL AND THE THESIS THERE

02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:14.545
IS THAT. CARBON NEUTRALITY IS-

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:15.980
SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH

02:34:16.046 --> 02:34:17.247
TO AVOID THE MOST EGREGIOUS

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:18.682
INJUSTICES OF CLIMATE CHANGE

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:19.850
THAT IN FACT WE ACTION NEED TO

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:21.352
REVERSE THE EFFECTS IF WE LOCK

02:34:21.418 --> 02:34:23.253
IN EVEN BUSINESS AS USUAL

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:25.022
TODAY- OR EVEN THE

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:25.990
CONCENTRATIONS THAT WE

02:34:26.056 --> 02:34:28.058
CURRENTLY HAVE. MILLIONS OF

02:34:28.125 --> 02:34:30.127
PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:32.129
UNJUSTLY FOR POLLUTION THEY

02:34:32.196 --> 02:34:34.231
NEVER COST TO THE RESTORATION

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:35.599
FRAMEWORK IS SORT OF THE ANCHOR

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.167
PIECE IN THE CENTER AND THEN

02:34:37.234 --> 02:34:39.570
LASTLY WE PUT A JUST RESILIENCE

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:41.739
FRAMEWORK TO TRY TO DRIVE. BOTH

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:44.775
STATE FEDERAL AND- OVERALL

02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:47.778
PRIORITIZATION- WHEN WE INVEST

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:49.346
IN RESILIENCE IN THE STATE TO

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:50.948
PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:52.883
COMMUNITIES FIRST AND TO DO

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:54.785
THAT WORK- WITH THE BEST

02:34:54.852 --> 02:34:58.422
SKILLED LABOR WE POSSIBLY CAN-

02:34:58.489 --> 02:34:59.957
I CAN GO THROUGH SOME OF THE

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:01.992
DAMAGES WITH YOU ALL- I KNOW

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:05.295
WE'VE GOT IT HAD A LONG HEARING

02:35:05.362 --> 02:35:06.397
HERE BUT- YOU. DON'T NEED ANY

02:35:06.463 --> 02:35:08.666
REMINDERS ABOUT. THE RAVAGES OF

02:35:08.732 --> 02:35:09.366
CLIMATE CHANGE WITH YOUR

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:10.668
DISTRICT IS IMPACTED BY THE

02:35:10.734 --> 02:35:14.438
DROUGHT- OR BY WILDFIRES OR BY

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:16.240
SEA LEVEL RISE FOR BY FLOOD

02:35:16.306 --> 02:35:18.475
RISK OR MAYBE BYALL OF THEM OR

02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:21.945
BY EXTREME HEAT- THIS IS A-

02:35:22.012 --> 02:35:25.249
MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR. PROBLEM

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.051
AND EVEN FOR CALIFORNIA ITSELF

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:28.185
THE PRICE TAG WILL BE

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:29.987
ASTONISHING SO WE HAVE TO GET

02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:32.356
MOVING HERE AND- WE REALLY TRY

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.158
TO PUT A BILL TOGETHER THAT.

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:36.160
CHALLENGES FOLKS TO GET OUTSIDE

02:35:36.226 --> 02:35:37.494
OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND COME

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:40.931
TO SOME CONSENSUS- ON WHAT ON

02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:43.333
WHAT'S TRULY POSSIBLE- BUT I

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:44.501
JUST WANTED TO NOTE AT THE

02:35:44.568 --> 02:35:46.704
OUTSET. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:50.007
TRYING TO INITIATE- A BIGGER

02:35:50.074 --> 02:35:52.643
TENTS WITH THIS LEGISLATION AND

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:54.845
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:57.748
BOTH FROM- THOSE IN FRONTLINE

02:35:57.815 --> 02:35:59.883
COMMUNITIES WHO WANT MORE

02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:02.119
SPECIFICITY AROUND THE

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.954
FRAMEWORK ESPECIALLY AROUND

02:36:04.021 --> 02:36:06.724
CARBON REMOVAL. BUT ALSO- FROM

02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:09.159
OUR FRIENDS IN ORGANIZED LABOR

02:36:09.226 --> 02:36:12.162
AND- INDUSTRY ITSELF WHICH WE

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.163
NEED TO HAVE TRULY IS PARTNERS

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:15.332
HERE- I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING

02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:17.501
TO RUN OVER THE CORPORATION'S A

02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:19.069
CALIFORNIA AND SOLVE CRIME IN

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:20.637

02:36:20.704 --> 02:36:24.074
PARTNERSHIP SO WE'RE WE'RE

COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIND

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:28.512
THAT CONSENSUS- IN THIS

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.481
LEGISLATION AND YOU KNOW THE

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:32.049
BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:34.251
NOW AND THE REASON- WE'RE

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.420
MOVING THE BILL TODAY- AND NOT

02:36:36.487 --> 02:36:38.655
SORT OF SLOWING DOWN AT LEAST.

02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:40.090
FOR THE MOMENT- IN MAKING THIS

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:43.026
A TO YOUR BILL- BUT INSTEAD

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:43.827
GETTING INTO APPROPRIATIONS

02:36:43.894 --> 02:36:46.029
WHERE WE CAN- SEE WHERE THINGS

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:48.866
STAND. BUT IF WE DEFERRED THIS

02:36:48.932 --> 02:36:50.768

PHASES SCOPING PLAN OR TO PUT

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:57.274
TOGETHER THE- THE FRAMEWORK FOR

02:36:57.341 --> 02:37:00.210
INVESTMENT IN RESILIENCE- AT

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:01.378
AND THE CARBON REMOVAL

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:03.080
FRAMEWORK FRANKLY. THERE WERE

02:37:03.147 --> 02:37:06.550

AT I THINK THE- OUGHT TO HAVE

02:37:09.353 --> 02:37:11.054
IT'S HERE IN THAT. NOW IF THAT

02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:12.189
