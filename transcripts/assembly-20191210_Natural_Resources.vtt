WEBVTT

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:52.445
Afternoon. Welcome to today's

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.012
hearing on mass timber and

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.714
other innovative forest

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.716
products- many of you who are

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.651
here know that we've been

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.553
having huge problems in our

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.655
first wildfire and ladder fuels

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.390
in the over abundance of them

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.292
is a contributing factor to

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.427
those fires and the problem is

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.496
that there's not much use right

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.498
now for those fuels and so

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.433
nobody wants to go into the

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.435
forest and clear them out and

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.003
when they do a lot of times

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.738
they just bring them on site

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.573
which is very bad for the

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.441
environment- and- bad for the

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:26.245
who live in the area. And we're

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:26.846
here today to explore whether

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.414
there are other uses for that

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.449
would- that would be better for

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.385
the environment better for us

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.420
and also to see what the impact

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.322
on housing and economic

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.357
development in California would

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.660
be if we- did find a- better

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.328
way to utilized as material. I

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:42.929
want to welcome you all here

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.697
today and I want to invite our-

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:48.167
panel to come up and join us.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:48.668
That I will let you all

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.603
introduce yourselves but just

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.204
keep your introductions very

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.705
short- and then you can make

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.707
your presentations in the order

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.676
we have it's up to you all but

00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:02.381
I have Jennifer- Montgomery

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.250
Britney Kovic- from hell gang

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.519
and energy lots of a and if you

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.053
want to go in that order.

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:12.325
That's fine. Okay. Ms

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.427
Montgomery welcome thank you

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.429
very much thank you chairman

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:16.963
chairwoman Friedman I am

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.397
Jennifer Montgomery and son

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.266
thank you for the opportunity

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.435
to speak today I'm the director

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:22.969
of the governor's forest

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.570
management task force and I'm

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.539
here to provide a look at some

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.241
of the challenges and

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.543
opportunities for a California

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.411
based wood products industry.

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.347
Leveraging the task force

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:34.881
California and our federal

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:36.582
partners aim to increase the

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.718
pace and scale of science based

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.653
forest management two one

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.588
million acres per year five

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.390
hundred thousand acres for the

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.024
state and five hundred thousand

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:45.491
acres for the federal

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.361
government. This increased pace

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.563
and scale will result in

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.265
increased amounts of merchant

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.267
apple timber end of low value

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.435
woody biomass creating

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.304
opportunities for entrepreneurs.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.539
All fire who you her from later

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:02.575
leads our efforts to prevent

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.042
and fight wild fire

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:06.245
increasingly tackles the task

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.247
of vegetation management.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:08.781
California has allocated a

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.583
billion dollars two hundred

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.518
million per year over five

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.754
years to scale up our forest

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.391
management. To meet our goal

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:18.891
this includes enforcing

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.693
vegetation and defensible space

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.561
requirements around homes and

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.563
communities and working with

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.632
Caltrans and counties to

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.267
improve vegetation management

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.269
along roadways and other

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.538
evacuation routes with the help

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.273
of the California National

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:34.740
Guard the California

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.442
conservation corps and many

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.511
others hellfire tripled fuel

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:40.546
treatments from thirty thousand

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.548
acres last year to ninety

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:43.149
thousand acres this year. And

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.517
implemented thirty five

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.552
emergency fuel reduction

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.387
projects that will help protect

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:48.888
two hundred of our most

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.623
vulnerable communities for

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.792
context the federal government

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:56.395
owns 57% of California's thirty

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:56.996
three million acres of forest

00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:00.533
land 40% are privately owned

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.702
and only 3% is state owned

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.437
given this ownership managing

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.305
our forests and creating a

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:08.374
reliable sustainable and

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.476
consistent stream of material

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.278
for wood products

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.413
manufacturing. Relies on active

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.182
and effective partnerships with

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:18.484
private landowners and federal

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:20.186
tribal and local governments

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.421
centuries of fire exclusion has

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.523
left overly dense forests what

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.525
development into the wildland

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.527
urban interface puts more

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:30.563
residents at risk wild fires

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.565
that had been relatively low

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:36.435
and moderate intensity which

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.504
cleared out underbrush and left

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.005
healthy forests now our

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:42.375
intensity stand replacing fires

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.343
that pollute our air. Destroys

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.247
soil watersheds habitat for

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:48.881
plants and animals and threaten

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:54.286
lives and property. When

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:54.954
governor Newsome took office he

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.655
strengthened California's

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:57.223
response to the growing wild

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.290
fire threat cal fire has almost

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:58.824
completed the thirty five

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.425
emergency projects including

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.526
removal of hazard trees

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.361
understorey clearing

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.296
reintroduction of managed fire.

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:06.298
Creation of fuel breaks and

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.401
community defensible spaces and

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.669
creation of safer evacuation

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.505
corridors all with an eye

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:14.540
toward preventing ecological

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.675
devastation and loss of life.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.577
Governor new some continues to

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.479
utilize the task force to

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.381
organize actions across state

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.383
agencies along with other

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:24.817
governmental and non

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:28.287
governmental partners. This

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:28.821
means we are not alone in

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:32.324
addressing this issue. In

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:32.958
twenty eighteen the US Forest

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.593
Service invested over two

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.295
hundred million dollars

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.364
nationally in fuels reduction

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.433
resulting in treatment of

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.501
almost three hundred ten

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.303
thousand acres in California.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.305
But due to fire borrowing their

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.274
twenty nineteen resources for

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.276
fuels reductions dropped by

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:52.578
nearly half. Beginning next

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.213
year the practice of fire

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.847
barring will be ended but the

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.582
proposed federal budget also

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.651
cuts the Forest Service

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.586
hazardous fuels reduction

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.755
account by over forty million

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.723
dollars. Given these realities

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.559
they have lowered their fuels

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:08.394
reduction targets hearing

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.362
California by almost a third.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.531
The US Forest Service will need

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:16.368
significant budget expansion to

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:17.002
increase treatments to the five

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.370
hundred thousand acres a year.

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.339
Healthcare is developing a

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.006
programmatic E. I. R. that will

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.641
address years of fire

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.577
suppression. By completing

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.445
landscape level environmental

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.581
review of vegetation management

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:30.516
activities it helps streamlined

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.518
projects while maintaining

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.420
strict environmental standards.

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.388
Friedman activities will be

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:38.224
designed to appropriately

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.493
reduce fire fuels site

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.394
strategic fuel breaks and mimic

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:42.962
a natural fire regime using

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:46.599
prescribed burning. To achieve

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.601
our target of five hundred

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:49.235
thousand acres a year to build

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.536
forest health and protect

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.638
communities we will need to

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.206
enhance forest's activities

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:56.442
from workforce development to

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.210
constructing production

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.212
facilities and expanding

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:00.713
markets for the would be

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:01.280
materials coming out of our

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.681
forest. Current forest's

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.450
treatments have created

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.285
thousands of slash piles in

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:08.420
California's forests an

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.623
estimated five million tons of

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.525
biomass. Well some of this can

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.226
be safely burned on site

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.362
finding lower carbon solutions

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:16.862
such as producing cross

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.697
laminated timber. Additional

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.766
traditional lumber products and

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.236
bioenergy including electricity

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.272
and bio fuels is our priority.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.307
Some demand already exists for

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:30.342
these products however most of

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:30.943
the engineered wood products

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.446
using California are imported

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:34.914
from other states and

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.715
countries. The joint institute

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.417
for wood products innovation

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.219
was established to identify

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.221
carbon sequestering products

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:42.821
and technologies that can be

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:46.492
expanded in California. And to

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.360
recommend areas for state

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.462
investment to support wood

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.298
utilization. Working with go

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.466
biz and others we are actively

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.435
reaching out to and recruiting

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.370
private investment into a

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.406
California based wood products

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.341
market. Building a locally

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.343
sourced and produced wood

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:04.843
products industry would

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.380
generate jobs in California.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:08.948
Create domestic markets for

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.549
materials produced from our

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.518
forests treatments into

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:14.453
mitigate climate change using

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.455
our construction materials and

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.224
for its treatment activities.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.359
The wood utilization working

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:22.361
group of the forest management

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.363
task force has focused on ways

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.234
to improve the flow of slash

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.767
from for it to buy amounts

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.703
facility. Which often struggle

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:32.638
to find reliable supplies from

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.473
forestry that projects. Debbie

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:34.974
Franco it OPR has been

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.244
successful in identifying so

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.446
called waste biomass that would

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.248
otherwise have been pile burned

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:42.848
or left to rot on the forest

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:46.619
floor releasing methane and

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:50.422
other GHGs. The task force is

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:51.023
wood utilization working group

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.358
has partnered with would works

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:52.958
in with the governor's office

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.693
on a mass timber building

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.629
competition we've worked with

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.263
the office of the state fire

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:00.232
marshal to focus on modernizing

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.234
standards for tall mast timber

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:02.801
buildings. Working with the

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:04.737
department of general services

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:06.805
we intend to identify three

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.507
future state buildings to be

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.476
constructed utilizing mass

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.678
timber. We are striving to

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.246
expand the would production

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:16.248
work force including Forest

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.384
equipment operators truckers

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.018
mill workers in small and large

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.388
investors. We will do this by

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:22.888
supporting training and

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.523
recruitment programs that

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.325
expand opportunities for

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.260
forestry and wood production

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.396
activities in facilities in our

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.698
state. This will send a strong

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.466
signal to private enterprise

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:36.368
that we are serious about

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.337
creating opportunities for

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:38.804
business to thrive in

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.308
California. We're confident the

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.376
efforts of these public private

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:44.977
partnerships that expanse on

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.745
its base forest management will

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.480
translate into greater

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.249
production of woody biomass

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:52.418
products resulting in safer

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:54.253
communities. Reduced wild fire

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.388
risk healthier forest's greater

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.324
climate resilience in

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.492
sustainable economic

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:01.026
development for our world

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.394
communities. The speakers

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.596
following me today will help

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:05.064
identify more of the

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.267
opportunities and challenges

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:08.934
facing us at the state relating

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.536
to woody biomass utilization. I

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.638
thank you for your time and I'm

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:14.273
happy to answer any questions

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.408
you may have. Thank you I'm

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.410
gonna I'm ask questions at the

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:22.348
end of the panel thank you. If

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:22.948
you don't mind just introduce

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:28.320
yourself and when a two lines.

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:28.921
Good afternoon share Friedman

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:29.555
my name is Britney cover chimes

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:34.660
the. Policy not reach branch

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.294
manager with this year in about

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:35.861
a Conservancy- stand about a

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:36.495
Conservancy the state

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:37.096
Conservancy under California

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.397
natural resources agency and I

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:38.997
think you for the opportunity

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:40.366
to speak here today. You're not

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:42.167
a Conservancy is really

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:42.735
committed to improving the

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.603
health and resilience of Sierra

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.538
Nevada forests and- part of

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.741
that effort is to support the

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.275
development of infrastructure

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.177
that can sustainably utilize

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:52.778
material produce from forest

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:56.281
management product projects- we

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:56.882
feel that it's vital to create

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.584
and expand markets for wood

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.419
products. That utilize the

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.354
forest species and sizes

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.390
harvested as a by project by

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:04.890
product of ecological

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:08.360
restoration. The state does not

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:10.429
have the financial resources to

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.063
accomplish the goals stated in

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.765
the forest carbon plan alone

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.733
and so we feel that we must

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.468
harness the power of markets.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.370
To support ecological

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.339
restoration as a complement to

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.174
state and federal funds.

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:22.741
Development of additional

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.276
Forest bioenergy power

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.278
generation in the Sierra Nevada

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:28.280
coupled with innovative wood

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.582
products campuses would provide

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.251
a market for excess biomass to

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:32.818
help increase the pace and

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.620
scale of forest restoration

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:36.522
activities will also creating

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:38.724
jobs and opportunities for

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:42.327
community economic development.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:42.995
As Jennifer courageous said the

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.596
effect of increasing the pace

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.198
and scale of forest restoration

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.434
will be greater volumes of

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:48.967
March and double and non

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.536
merchant of all material. And

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.571
currently a major major portion

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.440
of that by masses piled earned

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.341
in the forest. But it

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.510
represents a huge untapped

00:17:58.577 --> 00:17:59.144
resource for the generation of

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.381
heat power bio fuels and new

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.015
wood products all all reducing

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:06.351
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:06.919
Recent innovations and vile

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.320
mass energy technology

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.189
innovative building materials

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:10.756
and other areas provide an

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.324
opportunity for the

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.193
environmentally sustainable use

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.361
of access forest biomass. To

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:16.962
create valuable products in

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.664
California well increasing the

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.466
resilience of the state's

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:24.269
forests and protecting the

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:24.903
region's communities from large

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.572
damaging wildfires. This year

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.207
about a Conservancy recognises

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:30.309
the unique challenges that face

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:30.843
rural resource dependent

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:32.544
communities in the Sierra

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.480
Nevada. We've seen the

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.113
devastation that a catastrophic

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.782
wild fire can inflict on the

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.617
citizens communities and

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.385
natural resources of the region.

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.554
Economically many Sierra

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.256
communities are experiencing a

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.391
shrinking tax base a scarcity

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.427
of skilled workers and changing

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.362
demographics and while

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:50.896
recreation and tourism and

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:54.199
working landscapes remain

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:54.800
important elements of local

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.802
economies. Many communities are

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.337
struggling with economic

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.339
diversification and job

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:02.474
creation sort of brings your

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.476
this year about our region to a

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.110
holistic health the communities

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.445
within the region need support

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.647
that empowers their efforts to

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.616
address urgent needs plan for

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.351
the future. Develop

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.453
organizational capacity and

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.020
resiliency and envision new

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.688
tools and partnerships and this

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.724
will include a focus on biomass

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.227
utilization infrastructure and

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:22.728
workforce development in

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:26.231
support of community resilience.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:26.798
In twenty fifteen this year

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.667
about a Conservancy launch this

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:29.201
year in about a watershed

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:30.569
improvement program which is-

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.471
large landscape scale holistic

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:34.373
restoration program. And it's

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.575
being implemented across our

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.343
region through a strong network

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.512
of state federal local non

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.013
governmental and tribal

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.614
partners and through the

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.349
watershed improvement program

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:44.816
this year in about a

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.518
Conservancy is actively

00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:48.420
involved in supporting. The

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:48.987
establishment of community

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:50.556
skill biomass utilization

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:52.424
infrastructure and many other

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:52.991
partners that we're working

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:56.261
with our here speaking today.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.430
I'd like to provide just a few

00:19:58.497 --> 00:19:58.964
examples of the kinds of

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.666
efforts that this year in about

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:01.199
a Conservancy is sporting

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.534
through our grant funding

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:06.505
capacity building. And grant

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:06.972
writing and technical

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.506
assistance work that we're

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:10.542
doing. In twenty eight teams

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:11.109
here in about a Conservancy

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:12.578
received a unique one million

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:16.381
dollar appropriation from the

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:16.949
timber regulation and forest

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:18.517
restoration fund. I'm not

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.419
appropriation was given to us

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:20.919
and see to support the

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.688
development of innovative wood

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:23.188
and biomass utilization

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:26.592
infrastructure. Using this

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:28.594
funding the SMC supported the

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.529
Sierra institutes capacity

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.230
building program to help

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:32.831
communities with abandon mil

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.666
sites move through the process

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.768
is needed to redevelop the land

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.537
for new wood processing

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.572
businesses. This program will

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.674
include assistance with

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.141
environmental cleanup

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:46.445
infrastructure zoning and

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:46.979
permits and organizational

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.313
development and training. We

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.382
also serve as the project

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:50.916
manager for the national

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.751
disaster resilience competition

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:54.720
which is a seventy million

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:56.221
dollar grant that the state

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:56.755
received to implement an

00:20:56.822 --> 00:21:00.225
integrated forest and community

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:02.294
resilience program designed to

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:02.894
address unmet recovery needs

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:06.398
from the rim fire. And prepare

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:06.932
the communities for future

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:10.569
disasters. One of the pillars

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:11.203
of this project is focused on

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.404
developing a biomass

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.406
utilization facility into all

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.308
me county to help dispose of

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:16.842
biomass generated through

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.677
forest thinning efforts in the

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.379
county. And we're partnering

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:20.879
with the rural community

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:21.480
assistance corporation are see

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:26.251
AC. To implement this pillar

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:26.818
our C. AC will create a

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.620
revolving loan funds designed

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:32.357
to offer loans to enterprises

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:34.393
looking to start or expand

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.027
biomass utilization operations

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.395
and to all my county. And as an

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.597
alternative to pile burning

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.499
wood waste while creating

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:40.932
economic development

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:42.434
opportunities in the county.

00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:44.236
The fund will have an initial

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:46.338
capitalization of about

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.240
eighteen million dollars and

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:48.907
after initial loans are made to

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:50.242
projects and follow me county

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:52.544
loan payments will be deposited

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:54.312
back into our CA sees fund for

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.348
future lending to support

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:56.948
biomass and wood processing

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:58.684
enterprises. In forested areas

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.652
of California with a priority

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:04.289
in this year and about a region.

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:04.856
You're not a Conservancy is

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:06.658
also involved in supporting

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:07.192
innovative forest product

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.593
development by connecting our

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.429
partners partners in the region

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.230
with discussions at the state

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:16.268
level around market development.

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:18.303
And lastly the essence he

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:18.804
supports for us product

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.240
workforce development as well-

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:22.808
force management and wood

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:24.443
processing industries suffer

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.244
from a bottle neck of

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:26.778
inadequate work force the

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.613
problem ranges from forest

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.315
restoration planners to

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.417
equipment operators to Forest

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.553
crews. And so with the twenty

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.254
eighteen timber regulation

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:36.855
enforced restoration funds we

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:38.657
received we also use that to

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:40.659
support several pilot workforce

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.494
development efforts these

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.463
included a workforce

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.398
development needs assessments.

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:46.965
Which this year business

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.633
council might speak about

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.602
later- SPC was funded to

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.571
conduct a work force needs

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.539
assessment for the forest

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.508
products industry working with

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.376
state community college center

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.245
for excellence SBC's outlining

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.247
the work force needs. Available

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.316
programs and potentials for

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.251
additional program developments

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:06.852
and phase two of the effort

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.420
will be identification of sites

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:10.589
resources and curriculum for

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.089
program development and

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:14.559
implementation. In addition- we

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:16.394
supported the Sierra Nevada

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:16.995
alliance which is funded to

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.697
develop a pilot Sierra corps

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.665
program which is a professional

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:24.336
development fellowship program.

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:24.903
To provide additional staff

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.671
support to forest and watershed

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:27.305
health product projects in the

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:30.275
region let's program creates an

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:32.277
opportunity for career training

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:32.811
to increase the number of

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.378
qualified forest management

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:36.515
professionals. And last the

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.450
essence he provided funding to

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:40.252
the Calaveras healthy products

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:40.819
impacts solutions which also

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.489
known as chips. Chips is a

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.358
nonprofit organization which

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.593
recruits trains certifies and

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.562
deploys native American and at

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:52.564
risk youth to perform feels

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.633
reduction prescribed fire and

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:56.334
other restoration tasks. SNC

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:58.637
provided funding to replicate

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:00.572
their tribal forest probe

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:01.239
restoration of prescribed fire

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:02.607
work crew training and

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:06.378
certification program at other

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:06.845
sites with the hope of

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:07.412
spreading it throughout the

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:08.647
Sierra Nevada. I those are just

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:10.582
a few examples of some of the

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.417
efforts that were helping to

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.386
support in the region and happy

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:15.020
to answer questions at the end.

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:18.356
Thank you so much next. Good

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:20.492
afternoon share Friedman. My

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.594
name is- hell gang and I'm the

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.161
deputy director of resource

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:26.531
management that California. I'm

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:28.466
joined today by and your lotus

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:29.067
our assistant deputy director

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:32.370
for climate and energy. And

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:34.339
thank you for inviting us to

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:34.873
this really very important

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.410
conversation. We have already

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:40.445
heard there is a urgent need to

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.380
thin excessively down forests

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:46.351
in many areas of the state to

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:48.486
increase wildfires billion some

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:52.324
forest held. And traditionally.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.259
There has been a lack of demand

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:54.826
for the often small diameter

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.661
trees. Coming out of the

00:24:56.728 --> 00:25:00.365
standing operations which

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:00.899
usually have comparatively

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:02.434
little commercial value. In

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.469
order to facilitate a higher

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.471
demand for these trees. Our

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.640
state needs to develop

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:10.642
production facilities for what

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:14.512
we call mass timber which is

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:15.146
really smaller dimension pieces

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:16.615
so lumber there are glued

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.617
together or otherwise press

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:19.050
together into larger

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:24.322
dimensional lumber. Lower

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.358
background during the past few

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:28.293
years California has

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:28.827
experienced some the most

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:29.461
destructive fires in the record

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:34.566
history. In twenty seventeen

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:35.133
over ten thousand homes were

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.303
destroyed. Structures and in

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:38.937
twenty eighteen over twenty two

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:42.374
thousand structures. The last

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.509
few far season we have seen

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:45.110
over two million acres burned

00:25:45.176 --> 00:25:46.645
across the state. And over a

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:50.248
hundred people. Residents and

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:52.417
first responders have

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:53.018
tragically lost their lives in

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:56.488
wild fires. The effects of

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.423
climate change and years of

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.294
fire suppression activities

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.827
overgrown forests and the

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.596
prolonged drought have resulted

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:06.298
in an unprecedented tree

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:08.233
mortality in the state forest.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.769
As well as an increase in the

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:11.403
number of sites and severity of

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:16.374
wildfires. Loss of life and

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:16.908
structures as a director

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:20.178
proximate result of wildfires

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.414
is an all time high now. One of

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.184
the reasons that California's

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.386
sorry California's forests are

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:28.920
vulnerable to catastrophic

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:34.426
disasters. It's S. stated

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:35.026
already they are significantly

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:38.430
overgrown. There's not enough

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:38.930
water and sunlight the

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:39.497
available to support all the

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:44.202
trees on the given area. As

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.504
results men the trees become

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:47.105
stressed on Wall noble to fire

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.809
on the seas. Fires drought pest

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:52.210
outbreaks and subsequent

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:52.811
landslides are more likely to

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:54.612
be so damaging. That they may

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:56.548
not be able to recover and

00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.350
provide the ecological

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.452
functions when National Forest

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:04.389
after a such an event. And we

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.291
end up with what the cold type

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:08.360
conversion which is. Really a

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.829
conversion from a forest to and

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:14.499
other ecosystem. Typically

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.301
brush species which are much

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:16.868
less capable of storing the

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.336
amounts of carbon. That a

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:24.376
forest can. California aims to

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.678
help return are forced to help

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.413
the state by treating five

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:28.947
hundred thousand acres on

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.350
private lands every year. When

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:32.917
you combine that with our

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:34.686
federal colleagues commitment

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:38.456
of the same acreage. Five on

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:40.425
Tel snakes on federal lands. We

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.761
are looking at a total of one

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:44.729
million acres per year we feel

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:48.233
that can make a significant.

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.568
Meaningful ecological

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.604
ecological a meaningful

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.441
difference in this problem. I

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:56.975
should mention that tree

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.543
removal is really only one of

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.313
the tools that California

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.449
system and force helps. Other

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.351
methods include reforestation-

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:08.553
meadow restoration habitat

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.223
restoration road maintenance

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:12.791
prescribed fire mechanical

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:16.294
Dinning stream right

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:16.895
restoration. And the list goes

00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:20.432
on. These are all necessary

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.734
parts of the forest helps tool

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:26.438
kit that we use depending on

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.005
the management situation in

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.373
that particular area. In this

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.675
particular hearing since the

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:32.710
focus is a specifically on the

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.646
innovative wood products. We

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.448
are going to primarily

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:38.450
discussed the utilisation of

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:40.618
word coming out of the forest

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:44.389
during thinning operations. And.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:48.326
California's fourth currently

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:48.927
hold about two billion metric

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:52.530
tons of carbon. And in order to

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.732
stabilize that carbon once it's

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.367
removed from. Thinning

00:28:56.434 --> 00:29:00.472
operations. It's essential that

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:02.307
we keep it sequestered in wood

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:04.609
products rather than leave it

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.311
in the forest to become polls

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:08.413
and release greenhouse gases or

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.217
related to the atmosphere with

00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:12.817
other pollutants through pile

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:16.421
or broadcast burning. Some not

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.423
gonna turn it over to Angie who

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.057
will describe some of what cal

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:22.293
fired us to support the

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.827
beneficial uses the fourth

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:26.397
products removed during sending.

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:28.399
Thank you. Madam chair as

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:30.502
mentioned my name is Angela

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.002
autism assistant deputy

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:34.372
director cal fire- the demand

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:34.973
for mass timber in California

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.441
already exists. Cal fire has

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:40.445
dedicated staff that work with

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:40.979
landowners businesses and

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:42.580
public sector and entities to

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.349
promote mass timber as an

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:46.284
economically viable option for

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:46.718
the- disposition of

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:48.653
California's forest products.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.522
However right now the state of

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:52.290
Oregon is the major producer of

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.225
mass timber on the west coast.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:56.361
In fact the majority of organs

00:29:56.427 --> 00:29:56.961
mass temper products are sold

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.363
into the California market.

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.698
California continues to be a

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:01.299
major consumer of mass timber

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.302
manufactured elsewhere and

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:04.903
today there are no production

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:06.404
facilities in our state. In

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.673
addition to creating value

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.240
added wood products from

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.608
smaller diameter lower value

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:12.443
logs that result from forest

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.379
thinning. Master were also has

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:16.381
certain structural and building

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:16.881
characteristics that are

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:18.416
superior to traditional lumber.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:20.418
In cross laminated timber for

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:22.353
example the individual pieces

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.455
are oriented perpendicular to

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:25.056
each other resulting in less

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.391
shrinkage and warping than in

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:28.359
traditional lumber. Messed

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:28.960
embers also more resistant to

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:29.460
fire in earthquakes and

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:32.463
traditional lumber. The office

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.064
of the state fire marshal is

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.566
currently in the process of

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.367
adopting already approved

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:36.968
international building code

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:38.536
standards which allow mass

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:40.505
temper buildings to be built up

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.072
to eighteen storeys high in

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.740
certain occupancy groups. The

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.509
office of the state fire

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:45.109
marshal anticipates that its

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.644
code proposals will be heard

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.413
before the California building

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:50.381
standards commission. In July

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:52.317
or August of twenty twenty. If

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:52.917
approved the new mass timber

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.485
proposals would become

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:56.454
effective July of twenty twenty

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.021
one following the triennial

00:30:57.088 --> 00:31:00.391
building code adoption cycle.

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.293
Encouraging the beneficial you

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.596
use of force products also

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.331
helps us advance our state

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.499
climate goals what is one of

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:09.033
the most climate friendly

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.401
construction materials and

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:10.935
existence. Trees a Questor

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.570
carbon there for directly

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.472
contributing to the fight

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.241
against climate change. Living

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:16.841
trees and forests are one of

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.476
the major terrestrial carbon

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.378
storage pools. The absorb

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:20.878
carbon dioxide and major

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.580
greenhouse gas responsible for

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.181
climate change and store it as

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:26.351
carbon in there would. When

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.386
trees are harvested and turned

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:29.020
into wood products like lumber

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:30.588
and plywood the carbon remain

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:31.155
sequestered in these wood

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:32.657
products for the life of their

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.492
service in a structure such as

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.227
a building. It can be upwards

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:38.363
of a hundred years. What is a

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:38.896
renewable resource when

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.531
feelings are planted or when

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.467
trees regenerate naturally in

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:42.967
the forest after timber

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.237
harvester disturbance occurs. A

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:46.871
new crop of trees will regrow

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.606
and continue to sequester

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:49.173
carbon. In some there are

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.575
significant opportunities to de

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.644
carbonized commercial and

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.412
residential buildings by

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:54.979
building them out of wood

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:58.249
instead of concrete and steel.

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:58.683
Both of which have a

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.250
significantly higher carbon

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:00.518
footprint than what. Cal fire

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.620
offers financial support to

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.121
encourage the economic

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:04.656
viability of wood products and

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.691
bioenergy. Are for south grant

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.626
funds can be used to pay to

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.528
remove material from the woods

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:11.029
and Holla to processing

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.597
facility. When part of the

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.699
funds that are awarded to that

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.301
project are also used to

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.403
complete land management work.

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:19.037
Recently grant funds have also

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.705
been used to offer a small low

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.473
interest loan to a new bio

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:22.940
energy facility. This

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.676
investment in the new facility

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:26.544
both decreases hauling distance

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:28.479
to that facility. As compared

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.381
to existing facilities and it

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:30.848
promotes a bio energy

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.583
technology with higher carbon

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.519
sequestration potential than

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.019
conventional- bioenergy

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:38.489
technologies have. In the right

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:40.458
market and business environment

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:42.360
economic support could be used

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:42.994
to catalyze the development of

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.495
wood products manufacturing

00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.564
here facilities here in

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.533
California. Over the long term

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:50.368
this would require working with

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:51.035
landowners like the USDA Forest

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.570
Service to ensure a more

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.305
consistent with supply. And

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:56.674
with state business interests

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:57.308
such as the governor's office

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.476
of business and economic

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.244
development to ensure

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.246
appropriate economic incentives

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:02.780
are available and readily

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:04.248
accessible to interested

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:06.250
parties. Cal fire looks forward

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:06.884
to working with other entities

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.586
in the state to ensure that the

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:09.220
material removing is used in an

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:12.390
appropriate way. Thank you so

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:12.957
much for the opportunity to

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.726
testify today and Hogan are

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.294
happy to answer any questions.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.463
Thanks I have a couple of

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:19.063
questions and I'll just throw

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.331
the mountain whoever wants to

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:20.932
answer don't feel that you all

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.400
have to answer were. Little

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.435
time constraint- my first

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.270
question is you will mention

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:26.871
that the master products are

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.740
being produced mostly in Oregon

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.541
and brought here. So is it just

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.643
a question of us not having the

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.111
facilities or is there

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:34.612
something else going on that

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:38.416
makes them- being the place

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:38.983
that it's being manufactured

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.453
rather than in California. I

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.324
can take a stab at that I'm- on

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:46.924
a recent tour that we took of

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:50.261
some. Product manufacturing

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:52.330
facilities in Oregon. The

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.565
concern was really about the

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.567
initial cost to establish the

00:33:56.634 --> 00:34:00.271
infrastructure in California

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:00.905
and interestingly enough while

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:02.607
we may have a perception that

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:04.342
it's all about regulation in

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.277
California being an overly

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.279
regulated state what I actually

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:08.846
heard was we're not worried

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.615
about the regulations we can

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.550
work with those what we don't

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.619
have is the you know fifty to

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.487
maybe a hundred and fifty

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.489
million dollars. Up front at

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.491
two sites a construct and

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:22.360
locate a facility and get it up

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:22.860
and running so from my

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.529
perspective it's really a

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:26.397
question and economics rather

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:30.334
than underlying policy or

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.537
regulatory issues held a did

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:34.272
you have a different opinion

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:36.474
just add to that I agree with

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.276
the with that statement in

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:40.545
addition. What we heard was

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.282
that long term raw material

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:46.317
supply is extremely important

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:48.419
for any large investment like

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:52.523
this naturally. And. The

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.459
concern is being able to secure

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.694
that kind of raw material

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:58.429
supply in California. And the

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:00.431
and I think that's pro the same

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.366
everywhere and I think that's

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:04.469
an opportunity for the state to

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:04.969
facilitate that kind of

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:10.274
arrangement. Great thank you-

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:12.643
AB twenty five eighteen

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.278
requires that on or before July

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.414
first truth that a twenty

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.014
twenty the forest management

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.649
task force. I have to develop a

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.384
financially viable proposal for

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:20.818
the development and

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.553
construction of at least one

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.388
new master production- what

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:26.691
approaches the task force

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.626
taking when you're developing

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:29.160
the proposal on are you on

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:30.394
track to meet the deadline. I'm

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:34.332
I would say we are on track to

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:34.932
meet the deadline I'm working

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.801
with the joint wood products

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.569
institute we're really taking a

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.438
look at what would be the most

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.540
logical and frankly. Most

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.675
feasible to get up and running

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:48.546
quickly at the constraint

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:52.283
really around. Production of

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:52.917
mass timber as I indicated is

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.819
that initial huge expenditure

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.621
that's necessary and so part of

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:58.589
the conversation really is

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:00.458
around. Ways in which the state

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.593
can assist private industry

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.762
whether that's a revolving loan

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.430
fund or some other mechanism AB

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:10.501
I bank- to assist private

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:11.102
industry in getting a facility

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:14.338
up and running. Got it. A

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:16.607
Britney if the cut if the

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.376
Conservancy received more funds

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:20.378
from the legislature for grants

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.179
to support you know innovation

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:22.747
of wood products and rural

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.582
economic development what kind

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.450
of projects do you think would

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.653
apply for that and with that

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:29.287
support other work that you're

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.655
doing to any your body Sir

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.523
projects in mind. Absolutely I

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.458
mean I think that we have a

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.193
number with very creative

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.827
partners in the Sierra Nevada

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.529
region and people thinking

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.298
about this all the time about

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.533
best path forward- I think that

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.335
we've been able to support a

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.370
variety of different efforts on

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.004
both from the work force side

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.673
and then also from the

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:50.441
infrastructure development side

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.376
and there are a lot of those

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.478
projects that we could add on

00:36:54.545 --> 00:37:00.318
to and- building out- there's

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:02.720
also new new projects. To come

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:06.490
forward and you're like to

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:06.991
explore that you're not.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.561
Working in now. I have to I'd

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:11.128
have to think about that a

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.730
little bit more and get back to

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:13.331
you but I think we have we do

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:14.432
have the programs in place and

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.066
we do have the partnerships in

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.834
place to be able to. Really get

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.636
money on the ground quickly and

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.605
efficiently- but definitely can

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.540
put a little more thought into

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:23.174
specifics and get back to you.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.675
Thanks now back to cal fire how

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.544
many acreage have you guys

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.579
treated this year and do you

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.314
feel like you're are you. Know

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.350
do you know yet whether you're

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.418
going to meet last year's fuel

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.587
reduction or- be below that and

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:40.424
if so why is that. We

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:42.426
specifically for the thirty

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:44.495
five emergency projects we are

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.197
on track to meet our goals. And

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:50.768
we. Obviously whether it's a

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:54.271
big factor but- week we feel we

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.340
are on track- we have treated

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.643
more acres this year than last

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.745
year and we're seeing es that

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.480
Lea increasing trend. Together

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.615
with private landowners- and

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:08.519
incentivize saying. This kind

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.554
of work on private lands- we

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.723
feel we are on track to meeting

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.425
our our goals for the five

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.360
hundred thousand acres okay and

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.496
last question also for cut for

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.264
I think for coverage you

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:20.865
mention something interesting

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:24.335
about the- master producers

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:24.969
wanting to make sure that they

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.671
have a constant stream of

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:30.508
material- is that something

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.610
that's in doubt in California

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:36.380
and if so why is that. There's

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:40.384
no guarantees in in Oregon and

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.253
Washington apically you have a-

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:44.622
vigorous and demand and supply-

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:48.459
equation where this kind of

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:52.463
long term guarantee is.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.367
Relatively easy to achieve. In

00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:58.602
in California they will be out

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.571
of state players will be a new

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:02.473
entry into the market and so

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.308
they have to carve out a niche

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.410
for themselves to achieve this

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.412
Connell long term supply so

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:09.046
it's by definition going to be

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:14.218
a- a bit of a struggle but- we

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:14.885
think it's possible with this

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.754
up because of the nature of is

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.456
it the operators or is it the

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.391
nature of the forests or is it

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.226
what we allow to be harvested.

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.361
I'm just wondering where that

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:26.597
were that issue is I think it's

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.466
several things it's federal

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:32.336
forests have the- largest

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:34.538
supply but not necessarily the

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.440
large someone of a- harvest

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:44.248
opportunities. It's is also.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.650
Carving out a part of the

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.352
supply chain which is already

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.421
spoken for. To other buyers.

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:56.427
And it's. Being able to achieve

00:39:56.494 --> 00:40:00.231
that long term guarantee

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:00.831
requires of course funding and

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:04.468
investments. I do not think it

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.337
there is something

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:08.539
particularly- challenging about

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:12.243
California I do not think it's

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.211
regulations or policies I think

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:14.845
it's just a the nature of the

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.547
business and if I may madam

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:18.716
chair- what we've heard from

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.384
folks who would like to invest

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:22.286
in California is they want to

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.221
see long term contracts with

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:26.357
the federal government owning

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:26.924
57% of our forested land.

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.492
They're really looking towards

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.461
long term contracts with the US

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:34.231
Forest Service up recently the

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:36.433
first twenty year- MO you for

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.702
supply has been entered into by

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.638
the US Forest Service and we

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.573
think now that has actually

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.675
begun there will be a lot more

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:48.312
opportunities for- investors to

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.314
commit to California. And be

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:50.881
able to rely upon those long

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:56.220
term supplies. Thank you all

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:56.787
really appreciate your time

00:40:56.854 --> 00:41:00.357
thanks for coming. Our second

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:00.958
panel I'd like to welcome you

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:04.428
this panel is going to include

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:04.929
Glenda Herman's hermits

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:08.699
Hermiston. Heather straw and

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:22.513
heather strong. And again if

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.113
you could each just introduce

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:23.714
yourself with one or two lines

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:34.558
thank you. We love showing off

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:35.125
prop yeah I love the process

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:38.662
that. Well that's happening-

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.331
get started up my name is a

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:40.965
doctor going to human stern I'm

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:41.465
with the university of

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:42.233
California agan natural

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:44.368
resources- we operate offices

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.370
all over the state as well as

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.239
research centers and are deeply

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:48.772
engaged in many different

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:52.376
aspects of fire forest health

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.378
as well as economic development

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.580
and forest products. Of many of

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.249
the comments in my written

00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:58.883
testimony echo what you heard

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.651
in the first panel I won't

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:04.255
waste time repeating that other

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:04.822
than to just say ditto ditto

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:06.557
ditto ditto there right on. I

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.525
think what myself and my

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.628
colleague here will focus on or

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.263
some of the actual products-

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.531
and I'm gonna jump right into

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.567
it. Of this this is my only

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:20.237
slide on- advance wood products

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:20.838
because heather is going to

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.073
cover that in detail but I did

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.575
want to emphasize a couple

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.577
things and I particularly

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.946
wanted to throw slide up just

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:31.148
so people can see a picture.

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.217
Good we're discovering is one

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.985
of the room the having a hard

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:40.658
time visualizing Cooper talk

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:44.862
about when they met him and

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.897
pulled the buildings. On the

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.899
vent system again I think

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:52.770
federal go into much then then

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.805
I'm going to the job other than

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:58.876
the next slide. It is worth

00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:04.281
noting that there is a- delay.

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.450
Or California nothing is

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.385
because it is part of the

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:08.886
solution to these these

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.587
horrific fire and heavy bio

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.723
mass on healthy forests. That

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.591
are wreaking havoc in a variety

00:43:14.658 --> 00:43:16.327
of other ways including you

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.495
know water lack of good outdoor

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.631
recreation and wildlife habitat

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.366
are damaged by these unhealthy

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:22.933
for us as well. Getting the

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.601
materials out of their into

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:26.603
these products of bats going to

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.605
be the challenge and again I'm

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:30.274
not going to spend as much time

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.276
on mass timber. So let me jump

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.979
to a nother form of a very high

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:40.551
value use of woody biomass.

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:41.151
Which is so you lawsuit man of

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:44.555
hers. These are ex remotely

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:45.155
exile product that is what you

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.826
have in your hand so. I'm if

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.761
you look at bottom or you'll be

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.930
reinforced dent. In auto part

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:56.433
of it's K. lore in all US

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.635
troops have stay in in

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.904
Afghanistan for several years

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.973
now long with the gov Lorman

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.042
real made would be by on yes it

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:08.579
does up a bullet. The motor

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:10.481
company looking at the auto

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:11.081
body parts has been for a few

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:13.017
years- basically these

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.551
materials which have an

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:16.787
extremely high tensile strength

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:20.657
or basically written to run

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:21.291
from. The by us broke down for

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:25.095
the murder. Up in the north

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:28.866
this Siskiyou county. The proof

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:32.936
of concept of going up for some

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.039
years now about five looking at

00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:36.974
how you look at the end of your

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:42.279
Los reels in cement in a co

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:42.880
thanks for. Which the answer

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:44.481
back for using ride the of that

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:46.350
in some of the research right

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:46.884
now as a coating for fruit

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.819
itself which extends that shelf

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:51.021
life and makes it much more a

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:52.856
healthy and viable- coverings

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.992
for bridges an escort there's

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:58.295
just read brave used as the

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:00.397
this. Tax is to clean IT

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:02.566
because you look at the- you'll

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.468
take me- fibers to cement makes

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:08.572
it over 20% stronger as well as

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.407
much lighter and more elastic

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:10.908
and when you think about

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.509
needing that and buildings not

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:14.611
to mention the transportation

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:16.747
of those would provide the

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:22.219
cement products any distance.

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:22.853
There's huge savings there in a

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.455
variety of different ways. I'm

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:25.122
not going to spend a great deal

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.423
of time on bioplastics except

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.024
to say that night they mostly

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.159
because I am not an expert in

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:30.928
the field. But I will say that

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:31.428
right now we have we are

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:36.900
finding. And we use. Our bypass

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:39.136
in all of them support stick in

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:43.006
fact don't it is oversee eating

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:46.777
it is eight that in. Take them.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.979
Used petroleum K. made from no

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:51.081
matter I'm aye the technology

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:53.050
is there for it's not percent

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.585
prop on the server well on our

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.520
way we have over three hundred

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.355
come tearing formula currently

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.324
producing and manufacturing a

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.292
wide array of products that

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:04.194
have already received the USDA

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.396
certified bio based product and

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.332
again these are these are all

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:10.467
sorts of materials from

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:10.934
cleaners and oils and

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:14.471
lubricants- carpets furniture

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.406
plastics glasses bottles and

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.442
he's just all over the map it's

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.210
quite amazing so there's huge

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:20.844
opportunities there one of the

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:22.679
reasons I initially. Became

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.515
interested in both so you

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:28.485
lawsuit nanofibers and bio

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:30.554
plastics was because part of

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.322
the challenge of getting

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.491
biomass out of our for us as

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.493
well as making a profitable use

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.629
of biomass from other sectors

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:42.299
such as agriculture is finding

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:44.334
these uses that are much higher

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.770
value than just burning it up

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.572
for electricity- as as you may

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:52.242
know there is a time and a

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.478
place for electricity generated

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.313
from biomass particularly in

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.382
cho Chen type operations but

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:00.217
for the most part it just

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:00.817
cannot compete with our their

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.686
sources of electricity. And

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.354
then we're left with trying to

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:06.356
subsidize it something that

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.559
many of us do not feel as

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.193
economically viable in the long

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:12.896
run. You've already heard

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:13.530
mention of the joint institute

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:14.865
for wood products innovation

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.934
something that was created by

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.036
both exact border owned with

00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:20.771
fun I'm from SB eight four

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:22.739
nine. Which were excellent

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:24.741
belt. All working very closely

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:27.077
with the last six of you see

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:28.979
two years. Follows up the state

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.647
government many other partners

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:32.349
putting the but Sir. Just a

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.651
couple quick mentions of us

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:36.386
some stuff that's under way

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:38.522
right now. Of that I think are

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.290
pretty interesting of for

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:42.226
example you see Merced is

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:42.726
working with the super

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.695
insulated green building

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.430
technologies LLC which has

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:48.632
quite an acronym. Along with T.

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.434
three energy out of Australia.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.536
To develop some highly

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.438
insulated and load bearing

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.473
systems for residential

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.208
construction using wood

00:47:58.275 --> 00:48:00.344
shavings. Of from bark beetle

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.312
kill trees they're also

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:02.879
developing new technologies

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.748
working with UC Berkeley and

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:06.216
others that will facilitate

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:08.585
small scale manufacture of

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.721
products like glue laminated

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:12.556
beams and adapting that

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.658
technology used in glue lam. To

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:18.362
create replacements for cement

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:18.929
blocks and blocks utilizing

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:22.466
biomass other fully load

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.066
bearing and have some of the

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:26.770
fire. Fire resistant properties

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:30.240
you've heard mention elsewhere.

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:32.542
I want to highlight that up

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.411
getting this to move forward as

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:36.213
you heard from the previous

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:36.813
panel is not necessarily an

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.749
issue of regulations in many

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.417
ways it's an issue of how we

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:44.421
build economic ecosystem the

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:46.356
supply chains around what is

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:46.990
needed to get the manufacturing

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:50.427
here we have a wide amount of

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:52.462
interest I myself have been in

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.231
conversations with several

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:56.400
private sector entities that

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.235
are seriously looking at

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:58.769
starting up manufacturing

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.604
facilities in California right

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.639
now but part of the challenges

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:05.008
supply chain or financing or

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:06.877
knowing where the market is and

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.912
that's one of the reasons that

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.814
we're pushing very hard. To

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:13.116
really at all of that together

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:15.185
at a distance that could not

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.087
accept a both you see I can

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:18.922
natural sort the law with the

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:22.859
rural. Counties of. The

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:26.797
producers of California. Except

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:27.364
for your forward and other.

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:30.767
Recent report I called act in

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:31.368
which will place not only the

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:34.338
need to deal fire. Still room

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:34.871
to need to then look the

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.306
opportunity on jobs and

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:36.873
economic development in not

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.642
only a rural areas although

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.711
those are definitely a key

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.546
target for the entire state. Of

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:44.548
along with that so a very

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.883
exciting piece of news that was

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.885
announced at the summit. That

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.987
came out of or C. C. was a

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:54.558
brand new product what else to.

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.760
Of with bass told in state

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.862
actual store is a public

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:02.599
benefit non core not. Race that

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.735
is all about ripping by mass

00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:06.903
and then put to work they've

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.472
already got con next to help

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:16.246
reduce manufacture ship bands.

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:20.283
Looks to hand self could be a.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:20.917
Along with that the help of the

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.419
very first in the nation. He

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:23.086
master George green with the US

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:24.654
Forest Service for the entirety

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:25.188
of region five which is

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:28.225
virtually all of California-

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:28.859
this is critical because what

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:32.329
RC RC is done here is pull

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:32.863
together a wide array of

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.798
partners that are now involved

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:38.235
in identifying the source of

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.303
the biomass the financing. Of

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.339
moving it through the supply

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.241
chain they've made arrangements

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.243
for the manufacture and the

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.245
distribution and movement and

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.647
this is exactly what many of us

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.849
feel has to happen. In fact- as

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.918
it shows in this like fear this

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:55.552
is something we've been working

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:57.220
on for a year after that by

00:50:57.287 --> 00:51:01.057
will be I mean. You've but on

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.926
all three of you annals of with

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:03.460
a list of players. Looking

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:07.130
about. We literally go in there

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.166
in the end for supply chain be

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.067
a tent about it. At start up in

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:13.170
the first themselves we know

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:16.840
the moving bill mass any

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:20.844
distance because it's- an eight.

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.846
Okay but to spend. We've done

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.781
existing industrial sites all

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.917
the way up to see a- full file

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:29.052
mask old Tom but not you state

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:31.154
your first bill the street

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.622
lights on highways. What we

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:36.593
need to do is we need to

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.295
identify a string of those.

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:38.862
This of from south to north

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:42.232
that could be serving as early

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:42.866
pre processing facilities to

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:46.303
take that raw biomass for

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.338
through its first two or three

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:50.340
stages of pre processing unit

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.342
into a feed stock this been

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:54.311
lightly process. So then it

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:54.945
then could be transported down

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:56.680
into the valley floor and the

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.515
foot hills where we've got

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.317
highways and railroads and

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:02.352
ports of Stockton another means

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:04.321
of moving around and have our

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:04.988
manufacturing and then have the

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:08.325
market at the other end- SB

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.260
eight five nine encouraged.

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.362
Government buildings and state

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.364
buildings to look at using this

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:16.333
materials Washington state has

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:16.900
actually moved forward with

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.435
requiring that and I think

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.437
that's something this state

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:22.239
should certainly be looking up.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.374
There are certain about whether

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.243
these materials it'll initially

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.345
might be more expensive than

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:30.347
conventional although some

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:30.847
would say either rapidly

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:34.150
closing the gap but that may

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:34.718
not be a difference but but

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.419
let's say for sake of argue

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:40.390
there might be we could easily

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.559
for the first five years well

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:46.463
over. The system up and running

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.063
in getting the manifest string

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.634
bass bill. The dice difference

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.234
in those because the materials

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.636
of cap and it's fun it would be

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:53.270
a perfect for them to get the

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:53.870
market and this manufacturing

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:54.504
base these jobs in these

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.005
economic development in

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.540
California. University of

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.508
California is extremely

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.877
interested in this this is a

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.679
conversation we had for over

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:05.015
two years now as part president

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.516
hello Tom knows. The neutral

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.652
but twenty twenty five should

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:09.185
we not of three different

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:12.822
campuses look at tall buildings

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.758
from it would ext us but we're

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:18.929
moving rapidly on that. I will

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:20.931
close with just that choose

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:22.832
from previous books- this is a

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:25.101
real proper. In the state if

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:28.939
we- really bring all forced

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.776
together have a TI plant. Brown

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.277
for. All things being that

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.479
amount out which gore. Clued

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.715
select tech G. removed. I think

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:42.652
Frazier. About some wonderful

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:43.219
tools he's been looking out

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.421
from Scandinavia but but also-

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.256
new research new products

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:46.890
getting it out so that we've

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.592
got health your for us more

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.260
water those jobs and economic

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:50.860
development and as you heard

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.495
previously the buildings

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.931
themselves or a win win win. I

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.967
don't know about you but I've

00:53:57.033 --> 00:54:00.270
rarely seen that many wins

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:00.937
possible. Work after route make

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.739
sure infrastructure the supply

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:06.376
chains the work force the

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:07.010
research and development all of

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.511
that the financing all of

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.614
that's going to be at the table

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.181
to be part of the solution

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:14.451
thank you very much. Okay I do

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:18.388
have a presentation here. I let

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:18.989
the doctor go away over time

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.657
because she was so interesting.

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.459
But if you can okay was it was

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:24.394
it was really fantastic but if

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:24.995
you can try to keep it. Within

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:30.367
the settlement. All the start

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.001
with my introduction and then

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.569
we can flip through the first

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:33.136
few slides so my name is

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:34.604
heather strong. And I'm the

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.573
western senior director for

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.441
what works wood products

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.410
council. So Glenda gave a lot

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:42.379
of information on other wood

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:42.912
products so I'm gonna talk

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:46.282
exclusively about mass temper-

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.585
so what. What works is a

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:50.286
nonprofit organization and we

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:50.854
do get our funding from the

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.522
USDA Forest Service. The

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.457
softwood lumber board and

00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:58.561
forestry innovation investment.

00:54:58.628 --> 00:54:59.195
So we are actually tasked with

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:02.799
growing that would. Get sure

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:03.233
for non residential

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:06.803
construction so focus. Ext

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.337
silly commercial all tight

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:13.009
Michael Jackson. Do so we do go

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.844
through educating and in

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.445
private this is for the line

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:16.980
construction can be so the map

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:19.149
our twenty twenty case event

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:22.852
that would work posted. Eat it

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.888
in all actor but will also hope

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:25.422
twenty to thirty eight and

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:30.560
their end. Yeah to general

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.161
director northern California

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:32.362
Janelle lad who is here with me

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:33.029
today and Microman owski is in

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:34.664
southern California and they

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.433
work directly with the

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:36.933
architects engineers and

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.737
contractors. This is a picture

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.972
of all of the mass number

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.674
products that are currently

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:45.275
available in the market place

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.810
you're on an Intel. You have

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:50.814
two samples up there with. One

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.716
of them it process how many

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.784
timber sample it is the one up

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.653
on the top row on the right.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.955
You have passed wood panel

00:55:59.022 --> 00:55:59.589
ample water at the bottom right

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:06.863
hand side. What. I Mathis

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.698
timber map search scan all the

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:09.299
math are projects that will be

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:12.502
are aware. That our current

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:14.571
either in doesn't in order to

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:15.205
build to the United States so

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:16.506
nationally there are center

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.708
sixty four projects in total.

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:22.746
In California you have one

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:24.781
hundred master projects that

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:30.320
are a cut in line or have built.

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:30.920
So such excuse me the minute

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:31.521
provide pictures of some of

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:32.255
those buildings that are

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:34.758
located here in California that

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:35.358
have utilized mass temper so

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:37.127
the first is a building here in

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.995
Sacramento. To warehouse

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:42.999
artists lost this is. Was could

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:46.936
be fourteen. And it you just

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:50.940
better L. T. as in. And the

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:54.711
rest of it as a friend. It is

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:55.311
the first not Commer CE. Then

00:56:55.378 --> 00:57:00.717
caught yeah. The second project

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:01.317
which I know you'll hear about

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:02.919
in a little bit it Plumas me

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:04.854
bypass boys look in quick

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.956
California's of the relatively

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.424
small Marshall ject but it

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.627
suits me. I'm and used sealed

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:12.595
he 41100% of the structure. It

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:14.798
was also another first and that

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.566
it was the first to use CLT as

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:20.703
a lateral force resisting

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.271
system which for the design

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.806
communities a pretty big deal.

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:26.709
So this is genet child care

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.711
center located south Francisco

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:30.780
so this is this is up by child

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.816
care center. On campus. These

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:34.918
are single story bill comes

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:37.053
alive process I needed to bring

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.189
the- tall walls a free. Life

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:44.661
for our. Six top- expedition

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.830
academy located in Truckee

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:49.065
California and in this building

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.834
is to L. T. in the river. And

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.771
got my native timber and all.

00:57:54.838 --> 00:57:58.408
Did you says deal is for him at

00:57:58.474 --> 00:57:59.042
from what we've heard they have

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.844
plans for some it can all. On

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:06.816
campus lies same to assist. The

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:07.350
next project is not what

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:09.118
library look at and Brent woods

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.920
all four yes it is a two story

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.455
library project that use

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:15.091
utilize Scott needed. In with

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:17.126
the floor. And there are also a

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:18.561
building out front that you can

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.763
see just starting to get free

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.832
and state that you bill to the

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:26.369
rich. We also of that in this

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:26.936
the design team second asked

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:30.640
project to utilize. Last ember-

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:31.174
their first project they

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.742
utilize CLT in the roof only

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.777
and we hear that constantly

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.546
that design teams that work

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.481
with mass timber. Find that one

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.316
it's beautiful and two it's

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:42.352
quite versatile to work with

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:42.785
and so we see them

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.621
incorporating additional mass

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:48.758
timber on subsequent projects.

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:51.127
Ice block one is located right

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.962
downtown here and we're not

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.898
just blocks away just went

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.933
through this morning it's a

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.768
beautiful piece of the in my

00:58:58.835 --> 00:59:01.037
number. So it it'll aye tongue

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.805
and groove number in the river

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.874
and four X. include lamp post

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:07.043
and beam name. It had a steep

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.544
slope of forcing things and

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:11.014
also. Into your Lambie

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.051
staircase. This is a picture of

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:16.786
ice block on the left under

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:18.922
structure and just of note is

00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:20.924
the too large. Enough for

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:24.894
buildings on one great M. well

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:28.998
no and was listed nineteen for

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:29.632
maps number project engine I'm

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:34.871
not them. Reset and that they

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:35.505
have five passed project on the

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:39.208
books. The last one highlight

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:41.177
is the Christ the light in

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.912
Oakland California is just

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.881
beautiful this of large scale

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.816
first at a huge inspect.

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:49.118
Vertical learn actually ban all

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:52.755
went. Into the river all

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:53.289
construed as I'm being its

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:56.793
first cal. What were we- we

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.695
interface directly on a daily

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.763
basis with fining construction

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:04.500
community we are in here of the

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:05.134
her say right to what trying to

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:08.371
utilize passed. So as- a list

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.707
of some of the products we've

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.508
been on it try to the- sea

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.410
turtles right sources overcome

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:18.781
them. As this year we want to.

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.315
Educate contracts toward

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:22.919
signing caption Atty what we

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.188
found is a protect engine purrs

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:27.223
were very good about this for

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:32.895
one design with it. Actor would

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.797
ask questions like how on earth

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:37.033
did this at. Once let so with

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.068
two tracks toward idea is we

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.803
have constructing man rent. And

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:46.709
installation tracking. So

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:47.310
here's a map construction men

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.444
at work ups that we've together

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.980
and are we just started first

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:54.317
and see all. Up. Last month it

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:54.951
out and had a or one third cop

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.719
actors attended. It taught them

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.521
things like how to bed it

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.356
logistically what should they

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.558
worry about- so just help them

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.260
to get smart so that we don't

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:04.861
lose these to other building

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:08.297
materials. The in still in

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:08.931
training we've taken a bit of a

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.466
different approach we've helped

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.301
develop some curriculum and

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.303
taken a train the trainer. So

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.372
we started this Chicago's

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.574
carpenters union and held their

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.576
first a hands on instalar

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:22.512
workshop in April. And work

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.447
currently working with it with

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.349
wet carpenters institute they

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.251
will host their first one in Q.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:28.818
one of next year. And we've

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.686
also been talking with a few

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:32.622
regional college so that they

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.590
can take this curriculum and

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.626
implement it as well the people

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:40.830
coming. Out of school there.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.565
You did there and he- talked a

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:44.767
bit about the C. code changes

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:45.401
SO currently would. Map number

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:48.838
or like could only be utilized.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.940
Where it has ever been able to

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.610
speak which is six dory's last.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.879
For these new. Puzzles will

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:57.447
allow you up would to be you

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.182
and- seven eight teams is my

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:03.052
number only. So for the state

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:05.088
of California thank the many in

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:08.791
a penalty don this and be as

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:09.459
the executive order that as it

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.160
did in two thousand eighteen.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.096
That stated that these would

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:16.966
proposal from the IDC need to

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.434
be considered during intervene

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.403
codes for cap on yet so the

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.705
discussion currently taking

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.474
place it appears that it will

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.642
be on track to get adopted into

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:30.246
the twenty ninth California

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:30.880
building code into. Into inning

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.682
code cycle. So they would basic

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.484
hit the streets for- and be

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.084
effective alive twenty twenty

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.719
one. I will tell you there are

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.421
jurisdictions that are

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.256
considering these tall

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:40.857
buildings ahead of those being

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.658
adopted. And that is the end of

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:48.464
my presentation. Thank you so

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.266
the buildings that you showed-

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.535
were a mix of the mass timber

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.670
and- conventional building

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.806
materials is there a reason why

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.574
they did mix them instead of

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.409
just going full on- master.

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.645
Yeah there are actually a

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.580
number of reasons- it probably

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.549
depends project by project but

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.618
some of it is because it's a

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.520
new material sometimes they

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.321
don't want to take the risk and

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.457
go all and so they'll do it in

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:16.425
a smaller scale. The other

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.628
thing is- you know what to do

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.763
I. Believe you should use a

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.698
proper material for the

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.400
appropriate space and so

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.402
sometimes it makes sense to use

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.437
steeple team and then use a

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.439
master along with it the other

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.542
thing that might be a bit of a

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:36.345
hurdle that we have yet to

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:40.416
overcome. Is that the L. T. is

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:46.322
not cc number thrilled at a

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:50.560
lateral resist them to eight

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:56.265
when bring it seismic so when

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.434
earns the design in you can use

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.605
my number. And you can get it

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.674
approved but it is just that of

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.742
our process. Update with a code

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:14.584
updates affect. Now as you saw

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.752
there are buildings that have

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:20.289
used CLT in the walls but they

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:20.856
definitely a require special

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.491
consideration so you had

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.527
they're being tested now. That

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:25.127
mean that they'll be another

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.662
code update when that's done it

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.764
won't be like it's not on the

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.600
immediate horizon but some of

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.535
that testing is taking place

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.704
right here in the state of

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.339
California at UC San Diego. So

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:36.973
you read to support that once

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:40.276
that's completed. Someone will

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:40.810
ask for to be updated if

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:44.280
definitely yeah I went when the

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:44.814
information's available I

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.515
imagine people will be very

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.384
excited to get that in there

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:48.951
you. See L. T. out of a bug

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:52.288
infested waters. One can of

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:52.922
what works we don't manufacture

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.457
anything right- there are

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.024
enough there are a lot there

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.792
are number of manufacturers and

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.728
I do know specifically of at

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.730
least two that have utilized

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:04.300
the beetle kill would- in their

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.369
CLT. And often times they do so

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.304
at the interior plies because-

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.473
that would takes on a blue

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:14.510
tent- so they do utilize that

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.279
there are structural viability.

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:18.547
Still so structurally it's

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.449
still so yes. Do bill get lead

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:24.453
credit for using CLT. The lead

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.422
predator it's- you know. I know

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.359
its- I don't know if they get

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:30.893
lead credit per se I know

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.461
they're there are. I can't

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.563
speak to that. Typically I do

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.097
know that there are some

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.666
regional material credits and

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.601
some different credits that are

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.202
conducive to would that

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.836
depending on where the project

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:44.373
is they may or not may or may

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.940
not qualify as part of the

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:46.509
energy efficiency they

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.444
certainly can use that. Credit

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:50.513
they can okay- has anyone

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.481
quantified how much GHG

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.817
reduction. Master member can

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:56.419
generate Sir any kind of

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.421
metrics for that. Yeah actually

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.690
I've seen. Some buildings where

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.491
they've actually calculated

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.427
specific it's a building by

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.362
building thing but it's safe to

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:06.896
say a fairly substantial

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:10.266
commercial building. Is the

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:10.866
equivalent of taking thousands

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.234
of cars off the road per year.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.637
So the big are against the

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.305
material that I've been seeing

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:16.839
and for some reason some

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.541
popping up on my- social media

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.743
feeds so I don't know what

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.411
that's about- targeted ads I

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.814
think. But a fire safety so how

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.515
is that been tested and what

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.217
are the thoughts about fire

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.219
safety for this material versus

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:30.786
concrete or any traditional

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:34.223
materials. Well she can offer

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.392
detail but- one thing I like to

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.026
tell folks from a policy point

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:40.463
of view. Up when the twin

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:41.063
towers came down it's because

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.465
the steel melted. Of this type

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.533
of wood when it's properly

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.402
treated and constructed with

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.270
advanced materials now is

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.272
extremely fire resistant and

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:50.840
actually does perform better

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.475
than steel in many settings.

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.443
Yeah I would say it with the

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.345
trade. The attempt to implement

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.481
the codes for the seven

01:06:58.547 --> 01:06:59.081
eighteen story buildings this

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.750
was a huge concern. So I would

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.685
just suggest that woods gone

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.553
through probably more rigorous

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.322
fire tests and any other

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:06.922
building material. That being

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:10.559
said mass timber and there that

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.328
is the only type of technology

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.363
that will be allowed into the

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.232
seven to eighteen storeys.

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.434
Behaves much differently than

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.369
frame what. And if you consider.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:20.970
Like if you were to- throw a

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.638
big log on a campfire. It

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.573
charters around the perimeter

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.609
which basically creates

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.277
insulation and keeps the

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.479
interior cool so even under

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.515
intense light fires this master

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:34.316
Burke and maintain a lot of

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:34.884
structural integrity so it's

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.419
been thoroughly tested. And

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.654
doctor when I ask you this and

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:39.288
you know you know you said you

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.556
weren't the experts so you

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.391
don't really have to answer and

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.025
I know you maybe have a little

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.460
biased. But I'm just curious

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.629
by- plastic verses regular

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:50.366
plastic- environmentally I know

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.635
that the I'm told that the bio

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.537
plastic doesn't really to great

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.405
in the oceans either. So what

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.474
are the benefits to it. Will it

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.676
will degrade- much faster than

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.778
regular plastic a lot of the

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:04.647
issues around for their not bio

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.348
plastics is more

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:08.451
environmentally beneficial gets

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.419
into transportation and how the

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:12.354
products are moved to the

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.323
supply chain. But what we're

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.824
talking about here in

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:18.394
California of getting biomass

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:22.231
into manufacturing fairly

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.400
quickly with that transport and

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:26.335
with. Process vision. To a

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.637
normal plastics in any life

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.473
cycle analysis I'm thinking

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.241
more about the environmental

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.243
havoc that plastic causes

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.245
leader in the environment- not

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:36.779
to grading even landfill

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.614
conditions but you know harm to

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.181
marine animals that sort of

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:42.618
thing. What bioplastics does

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.553
too great a like I said. Many

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.522
plastics don't great all for

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.089
hundreds of years it will

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:48.624
degrade one of our issues is

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.626
going to be as we currently

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.428
have with food waste and other-

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.697
biodegradable. Is making sure

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.398
that we're managing that for

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.567
the potential methane. And

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.569
folks are looking at that okay.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.238
Thank you both really

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:02.838
appreciate her information was

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:04.640
written super interesting. Okay

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:10.246
our last panel. And stakeholder

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.515
perspectives. We have Jonathan

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:24.560
being here. If you could each

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.160
just again introduce yourself

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:28.397
with one or two lines. And then

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:28.998
do your best to keep it under

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:36.272
seven minutes each. I am state.

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:48.584
You must. Yeah. Part during the

01:09:48.651 --> 01:10:00.829
two. Sure Friedman thank you

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.298
very much for holding the

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.233
hearing it's my pleasure to be

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:04.900
a part of it Johnson Q. soul C.

environment a nonprofit

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.372
organization based in the

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:10.940
northern Sierra- we've been

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.608
around for about twenty five

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.443
years. I'm gonna quickly run

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.545
through some slides to share

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:20.716
with you what we've been up to

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:21.283
our here is that first full

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:26.755
cross là. Did to. Bill built

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.356
in cap corner the are the club

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:31.160
corps of. You're either going

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:35.064
to play. And all right you see

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.932
some of those goals are in a

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.703
safe and stable là and then in

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.871
the bottom right to see proof

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.807
all I've layer thick then let

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.842
stick up a roof panel No tornal

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:50.879
structure yes you see some

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.948
state. It died the thing. Lower

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.217
left is the route they were

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.585
believe what people to do they

01:10:56.652 --> 01:11:00.456
never any in light of they felt

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.324
like they could work with the

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:02.925
material this whole building

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.727
went up in two days- but there

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.962
was a fair bit of structural

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.864
work. For the foundation but

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.666
it's our impressive it's a

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.901
beautiful building. And it

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:14.837
houses a boiler a black mass.

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:18.841
Or the interior of the building

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.976
it's prop one of the Butte boil

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.711
buildings you simply have blues

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:26.749
and find another. Are the book

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.917
there is a street and in the

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:30.686
right this picture you see

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:33.088
what's called a are the unit or

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:36.492
in a king. Psych to start with

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.560
also make it actress. Makes

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.396
this a combined heat and power

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:40.929
for so the- we're pretty

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:42.798
excited about what we're able

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:46.335
to do with it it heats. The

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.370
Plumas county health and Human

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.472
Services center it was funded

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.006
by the California energy

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.075
commission and we're about

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:53.676
ready to give that building to

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:58.580
the county. This whole idea

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.050
came up a planning process to

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.052
port the California energy

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:05.087
efficient about network of mass

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.989
boil try to tackle the problem

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.757
what did it all the spell mass.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.693
You see that alright. Our

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:13.062
record goal- the Oilers are

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:16.799
pretty good for their green.

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:17.366
Stack building in the bill

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:20.369
that's a by OPG campus or by

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.371
campus. But was it in camp

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.473
before talk about that. I want

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.007
to mention why were folks

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.575
interested in these biomass

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:30.579
burning boilers this is just a

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.681
simple graph and- the right

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:38.887
most. Of the E. Y. at this is

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:42.891
Megan I'm spur Cuba meet. And

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.194
for night in eighty two you can

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.161
be a dot right ten was an-

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:48.931
internet awfully equal nine

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:49.498
thousand parts per minute in

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:53.168
carbon knocks. You can see it's

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:54.303
their most obvious is the

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:58.407
client in. This is Kerr by not

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:02.277
I'd so oil got term. Skinner

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.613
over time they've also gotten

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.283
medical more fit. To these

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.951
thoughts represent- so folks at

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.586
the data that. And we more of

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:14.356
this and what do so speaks to

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.525
is died here a week the bill

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:18.293
clean boilers Bernie how may.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.429
They weren't near clean in the

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.297
early nineteen eighty you can

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.933
be that these small scale

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.069
boilers it also rise are just.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:31.039
As well. Moving on to the can

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:36.812
this year. Pick your salute

cannabis techno rated in it and

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.949
Valley in eighteen these closed

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.951
in the mid eighties enable

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:43.552

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.260
Bob I show you the lower left

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:54.763
sure cuts use all right middle

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.965
of that the engine the bill

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:57.499
right that little to the

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.201

P. P. substation shows because

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.873
the per place but pop in the

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.675
system you can build things

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.811
that's where they were heading

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:12.815
or or putting patterns minutes

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:15.250
all up. Mind power also does

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:19.087
Rick track. Twenty eight site

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.889
right pictures without. Any

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.125
eight in I'm gonna go to this

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:26.795
this but hill from there that's.

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:28.997
File when you work these prop

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:30.933
X. working essentially Burke

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.935
feels their trip search engine

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.937
time coming we pretty rate over

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.772
in Dahle to remediation for

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:37.372
light pourtant right here one

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.843
possible to if you look all the

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:42.778
items last edit this particular

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:46.415
night. Lot of exiting the dot.

01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.684
Don't go through the other than

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.552
to say. Whether it's ample our

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:51.086
site characterization or

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.487
developing risk assessment and

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:54.356
a room removal action work plan.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.525
It's costly but is an

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.660
opportunity rather than trying

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.529
to create new sites these old

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.497
mill sites offer great

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:02.965
opportunities for wood

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:08.704
utilization. So here we are

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.271
twenty nineteen clean up in

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.674
progress five years later. Up.

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.910
Thirty eight we're excited

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:18.881
about being out or do the work.

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.582
And it is the idea of the

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.918
campus that had me there's a

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.720
girl- and portent here is the

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:27.022
lies black represent Sherman

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:30.859
block if you will green lines

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.594
are we about Bob mass let's say

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.930
ten then the line art eat so it

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:38.767
about using material about

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.702
using Tricity it's a- slicing

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:43.238
he- the right column of tanks

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:46.775
are the different prop X. the

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.677
peak of it can't. Connect some

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:51.146
of the men that came. From a

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.449
would you patient camp. Renew

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.652
my energy. We're hoping that

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:57.219
upper green some we are on

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.487
track with the Lassen volcanic

01:15:58.553 --> 01:16:00.522
national park to develop plant

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:02.424
restoration material that would

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:03.025
be produced in a greenhouse

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.693
conceivably on site. And more

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.695
you also see across laminated

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:10.332
timber operation we have talked

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.234
about that and we have visited-

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.403
DR Johnson's facility up in

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.037
Oregon happy to talk about that

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.538
further I hadn't planned on

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:17.205
talking about it but with some

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:20.909
of the questions asked- can

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.744
respond to some of them as well.

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:26.782
And here is the first business

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.884
in poll Hey it's a thing

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:29.484
operation because we supply.

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:32.921
The sailor and see what it for

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:36.458
president. We have. For some of

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.360
the fat it's going on it in.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.562
Fly Valley we also have some

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.564
material from the campfire that

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.333
we brought up to make sure that

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:44.900
we had drive material last

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.668
winter like everyone else we

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:50.539
had trouble procuring- material

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:54.242
that wasn't west. So this is

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:54.876
what's powering the boiler and

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.678
we're hoping to produce- to

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:58.513
have a network of boilers and

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.382
I'm really excited. To say

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.551
that- I heard this morning that

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:04.386
there's a preliminary approval

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.521
for support for yet another

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:07.089
boiler in the town of Quincy

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:09.024
through the Sierra Nevada

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.859
Conservancy. The chipping

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:14.796
material the handling. They are

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:18.233
well funded by. Service as well

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:18.867
they absolute vital interest in

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:22.237
helping. Idea to fruition

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.773
there's a ways to go but up

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.340
close with just a couple of

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:28.977
points. And that is. If we're

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.612
going to succeed the

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.048
restoration of forest the point

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:33.582
is made by number of four

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:38.553
alright. We need new Matt

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.989
actually first that's awesome

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:43.025
to any and then. Also in rural

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:46.461
people in later to do it. And

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.029
we the bill that's going to

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.463
the- term store. Sec I thank

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.064
you pleasure to be here thank

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:52.667
you. Next panelist thank you

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.503
I'm sure Friedman- good

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.137
afternoon I'm rich Gordon and

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.605
currently service president and

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.640
CEO of the California forestry

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:02.477
association- the fourth we

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.045
association represents the

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.312
companies in California- the

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:08.383
groceries and produce lumber-

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.452
we are. Obviously value would

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:14.389
as a building product- back we

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:14.890
think it has to just a

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.591
tremendous potential to meet a

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:18.760
whole set of climate change

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:22.230
goals for California. Would

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.466
sequesters carbon- and do that

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.468
when you construct with wood-

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.303
that clicked carbon stays in

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.937
the wood for the life of the

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:32.240
building- we're also building

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.242
with the material that is a

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.578
renewable resource and we can

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.547
re grow trees. As and so on-

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.615
the it would has tremendous

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.551
potential- help us with our

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.719
climate goals and what has been

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.688
the primary building material

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.590
for single family homes. For

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:52.561
decades- today now we come to

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.796
up the possibility these new

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:58.467
wood products mass timber- and

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:58.967
what mass timber holds

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:02.637
potential to- move would beyond

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.339
just single family home

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:08.477
construction- would to it mass

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.111
timber products are being used

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:12.581
around the world- dormitory

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.549
and- Vancouver British Columbia

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:18.420
eighteen stories with wood-

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.555
office buildings- all across

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.591
Europe- twelve to eighteen

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:26.328
stories. All with wood- so it.

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:28.630
It it is a building material

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:34.269
for the future it also has

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:34.836
great potential for modular

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:40.375
construct. And I think if you

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.042
note. In the slide you just saw

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.477
of panels being brought in and

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.346
put in place. You can pre fab-

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.381
this material and the cost

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.450
reduction that can occur in

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.252
building multiple multiple

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.387
family housing for. Low income

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.489
housing is tremendous- read

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:58.326
reducing construction time in

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:58.927
using material that has great

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:02.397
benefit. So currently though-

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.633
and from the buildings you've

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:08.303
seen in the slide so far- I

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.472
think it's safe to say that

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:12.307
mass timber really is still a

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:14.543
niche product- there are early

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:18.346
adopters who are using it

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.382
experimenting learning about

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.684
it- I absolutely believe. That

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.553
we are going to grow rapidly

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:28.256
beyond these early adopters- as

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.392
more and more buildings will be

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.327
built using mass chamber in

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.329
California. And the world- and

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.464
the timber industry wants to be

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.433
supportive obviously of this

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.735
effort. The challenge that we

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.337
perhaps have in California. Is

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.639
that currently are timber

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:50.478
companies- harvest and process

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.380
to a sustainable level. They

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.416
meet the requirements of the

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:54.950
forest practice rules of

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:56.651
California and they do that in

01:20:56.718 --> 01:21:00.422
a way that sustains of the

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:02.591
forests. And we use only the

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:06.294
would that they need- at any

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.296
given time to make sure that

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:08.830
they are maintaining their

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:12.334
force for future production. So

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.336
we don't you know go in and

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.371
take out all the trees up and

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.440
we are very selective in terms

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:20.408
of- the harvesting that we do

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.277
in the way that we do it. And

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.546
we're again- essentially at

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:28.483
capacity. On private

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:32.387
timberlands for production. And

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.623
that means that in order for

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.424
California to grow- a woods

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:40.362
products industry we've got to

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:40.996
look at other sources of supply

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:42.564
for material. And has been

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:46.401
mentioned previously probably

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:47.068
one of the best sources of that

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:50.305
is a federal lands that since

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:50.939
you own fifty seven percent. Of

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.440
the force in California.

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:54.509
California's also print in in

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.511
will in some ways from Oregon

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.446
Washington. And we talked you

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.315
talked about that earlier- and

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:00.815
that is that in Oregon

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.617
Washington an awful lot of the

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.419
timber lands are owned by the

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:08.356
state government. And here- you

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.425
know we're about 2% of the

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:10.925
timber land on by state

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.294
government. But in Oregon

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.462
Washington when they have set a

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:14.929
target for more would

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.698
production. They have been able

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:22.304
to do that- by activating their

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.937
state forests as source of new

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:26.574
wood- and so looking at Gen.

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.610
The California probably is

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:32.414
looking at federal timber- for

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.416
additional supply- the-

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.618
industry not only aids

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:40.388
guaranteed supply. But it needs

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:40.955
guaranteed markets and so as

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:46.294
the. Mark for timber grows-

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:46.928
industry will be more likely to

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.430
be engaged and invest. Of

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.498
finally the challenge we all

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.367
seven California is that. We

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:54.469
don't have currently adequate

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.571
infrastructure- to remove wood

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.740
from force whether be federal

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:02.510
force- or others- the there.

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:06.214
Are workforce- has been

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:06.815
downsized over the years to

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.650
meet the production

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.618
requirements- that the timber

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.354
companies have in California-

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.489
we have reduced the number of

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.491
saw mills we reduced. The

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:20.328
number of loggers and so we're

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:20.995
operating here in California at

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:24.366
a level that essentially meets

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.334
our sustainable goals- but is

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.470
difficult to expand those

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.305
without some additional

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.207
investment in infrastructure.

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:32.741
And knowing that we have

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.576
adequate of supply an adequate

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:40.215
markets. I think that you will

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:42.350
see investment in California-

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.552
in the future in- in New but

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:46.621
wood products and in New per-

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:50.225
potentials- building and

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:50.825
construction you're going to

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.694
see I think it the possibility

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.229
of new manufacturing

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.464
facilities. But it will take

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.433
some support from the state to

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.502
get their- I think there's a

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.069
couple things that the state

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.637
legislature can do in that

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:06.474
regard. One is- I think the

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:06.975
take legislature can do

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.676
whatever it can to encourage

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.645
the state fire marshal. To

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.747
adopt the building codes that

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.682
allow wood construction up to

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.418
eighteen storeys- state fire

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:18.686
marshal the indicated could not

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.855
so sure that wants to go that

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.657
far- but I think encouragement

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.426
from the legislature make sure

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.428
that we're setting the right

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.229
tone and saying that we do want

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:28.763
to construct with wood in

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:32.367
California. For the long haul.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.502
The California the legislature

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.036
could also consider tax

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:38.406
incentives. To help create an

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.408
environment where- industry

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.677
would invest- in the kinds of

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.612
brownfields that you've seen.

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.581
In these sites that exist. In

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:48.650
our forced areas of we have

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:52.220
land that was once saw mills-

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.456
land that was once under timber

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:56.458
production activity- those

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:56.958
could be. Re energized

01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.595
reconverted- and tax incentives

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.464
might be one pa option- I think

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:06.334
also that the legislature.

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.436
Could continue to promote the

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:10.572
use of mass timber and timber

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:12.407
in production. Encouraging as

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.642
was done and- eight fifty nine

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:18.413
the for the use of the what is

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.013
a building material in state

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.548
buildings- would be a great

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.550
opportunity for could a bill to

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:26.321
the natural resources building.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.323
Using mass timber the. That

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.558
finally I think that yeah the

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:31.092
legislature has a role as

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.293
you're doing here today- in

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.462
continuing to educate the

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:35.029
public. It's important for

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.564
folks to understand the value

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:38.733
of wood. What it can do in

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.568
terms of our carbon goals what

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.504
it can do in terms of our

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.472
greenhouse Gaskell's. Of how it

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:48.243
can. Be a beneficial renewable

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.478
resource a product that

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.280
produces strong tall buildings.

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:56.384
In a product that will bring

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.620
value to California. So I would

01:25:58.686 --> 01:25:59.220
encourage the legislature to

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:02.357
get up and take a look at that

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:04.492
these options- and continue to

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.761
support would as a viable

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.496
constructive construction

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.063
material here in California.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.532
Thank you. Thank you Mister

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:14.269
Gordon the next panelist please.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:20.708
The final. Sure can you. Give

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:28.783
us like. I don't know where he

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:29.350
has and to be honest you can

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:32.687
either. Public speaking with

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:48.303
Michael

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:50.805
. Good afternoon madam

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.507
chairwoman and thank you so

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:54.309
much for this opportunity to

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:54.976
address the legislature on this

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.477
important issue- my name is

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.646
Steve fresh I'm the president

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.381
of the Sierra business council

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:04.252
we work on sustainable economic

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:04.819
development issues in the

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.688
Sierra Nevada. And as you might

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:10.558
gas- Forrest forest management

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.594
wood products and the future of

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.395
California force a very

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.397
important to us here in about a

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:18.666
communities from both an

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.167
economic and a cultural

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:22.270
perspective. Is this council

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:22.937
has been involved in this area

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:24.739
for- quite some time we are the

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.608
small business development

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.242
center for northeastern

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:30.511
California. So many of the

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.112
proposals we see through our

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.747
small business development

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.616
center have some intersect with

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:36.517
natural resource management. We

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.820
also run a climate adaptation

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:40.788
and mitigation program that

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.523
looks at the future of

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.659
California forest in our region

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:46.694
and protracted are projects of

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.529
vulnerability first year in

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.331
about a community so- the

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:52.500
future the force a very

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.502
important to the future. Of the

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:55.136
vulnerability of the residents

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:58.272
of our region. With assistance

01:27:58.339 --> 01:27:58.906
from the California governor's

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.808
office of business and economic

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:02.710
development we provide direct

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.545
technical assistance to

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.648
businesses looking to locate in

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.416
the Sierra Nevada region-

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.618
through a technical assistance

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:12.453
expansion program that they

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.322
have we can actually consult

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:14.956
with businesses to do financial

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.658
planning business planning

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.626
supply analysis and market.

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.595
Analysis and we have been

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.630
directly intersecting with a

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.465
number of businesses looking to

01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:26.801
locate in the region and doing

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:28.302
that kind of analysis for them.

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.772
We have been partnering for the

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:34.275
last three years with the-

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.344
American renewable power. Who

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.413
is repurpose saying a twenty

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:38.946
megawatt biomass facility

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:42.283
located in Loyalton California.

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.385
And the key concept behind that

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:46.354
twenty megawatt facility is

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:48.423
essentially co locating a value

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.425
added wood products campus-

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.727
with the biomass facility in

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.529
order to use the waste heat.

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:56.798
And the supply chain to stand

01:28:56.864 --> 01:29:00.268
up by mass based businesses

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.270
including looking at

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:04.372
opportunities for things like

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:04.939
cross laminated timber and

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.674
oriented strand panel were wood

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:10.578
panel production. And then

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.714
finally- as mentioned earlier

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.582
by Britney Kovic as part of our

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.617
kind of- work in this area

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.486
we've also been looking at-

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:20.555
workforce employment and

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:22.390
training opportunities and I

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.492
want to zero in. On that issue

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:25.126
today because we think there's

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.761
a tremendous opportunity for

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:30.398
employment economic development

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.433
and- skills building in the

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.034
north state and the forested

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.635
regions of the state around

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:35.236
wood products and wood product

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.573
manufacturer. So as you might

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:42.810
gas as and as a doctor you

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.912
missed and pointed out there

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:47.014
are a variety of. Import it's

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:50.885
Thursday be created out of.

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.987
Wood thanks I checked the for

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.156
is active- made for a manager

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.191
with clues worst mission

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.060
involves planning look ever be

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:04.799
quick operate. Like that. When

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:07.001
this these cell which is

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:10.838
tracking yes the energy may.

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:13.141
I'm secure the whole number

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:16.844
well number five kind of yes.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.913
Product production and hearing

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.915
and then the strap and the

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.817
thing trips that are associated

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.986
with that. Biofuels man sure

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:28.990
which as our chemical engineer.

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:31.025
For about out of. Last case

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:38.800
says you with. Gen what was op

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:41.002
appoint route out I'm sorry

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.070
your boss the no five that each

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:45.106
one goes next buyers don't Xin

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:50.411
in a have a playmate. He says

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:52.580
it with and then the by fast

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:54.582
and consumer products Q. we

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.450
think it's best a wanted an

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:56.984
opportunity for replacing

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:57.585
petroleum based products- the

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:58.386
answer to a previous question

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:59.020
you ask I've been looking into

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:00.488
quite a bit lately around- what

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.456
is the rate of decomposition of

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:04.492
different bioplastics compared

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.527
to petroleum plastics and what

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:08.462
I'm discovering that of course

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.464
a lot of it depends upon- the

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:12.500
replacement what is that the

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.502
material- it's replacing right-

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:18.372
but they take be engineered to

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:22.376
decompose in about a fifth- of

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:23.010
the time and seven products can

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:24.812
be engineered to decompose in

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:26.414
three to five years which

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.382
would. Mean that they would be

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.016
much less long lasting in the

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:34.889
environment in in some of those.

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:35.489
Applications I think that's a

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:38.860
really interesting question. So

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:39.327
current employment in

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:39.927
California's forest sector see

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:42.997
I have a little. Problem there

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.799
but I'm as part of our work

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.201
for. An intriguing as you've

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:50.571
been looking at the two of is

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.172
the current employment and for

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:56.944
a lot. I am select is actually

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.946
managing up in those plants I

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:02.683
would menu. In all of

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:05.052
facilities process when you

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.854
hope that paper may actually.

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:09.023
What for me back in and have

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.192
and with the based on two

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:12.593
thousand and fifteen in a

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.762
brightly update to that and in

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.597
nineteen to the may okay growth

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:19.133
used and I met model called him

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.670
and which identifies right now

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:25.072
roughly 2% California. Worse

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:30.611
your job. It could be the right

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:34.715
to do. This eight those second

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.484
jobs as you might as well see

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.853
an- option because of what your

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.556
main picture and. Not because

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:46.527
poorest chamber but but it

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:47.128
gives you an idea I think of

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:47.695
what the current employment

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:48.829
sector is and what some of the

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.431
opportunities might be one and

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.366
note that these are the direct

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.669
jobs not the indirect jobs or

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.771
what's known as the multiplier

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.639
of fact to give you an idea of

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:00.408
what some typical multiplier

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:02.443
effects might be in the wood

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.578
biomass energy industry the

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:08.382
typical- calculation is that

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:10.318
for every direct job in a

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:12.453
facility this roughly three

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.322
point five jobs in the supply

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:16.357
chain. That are stood up by

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.592
that so if you looked at this

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.461
and applied a multiplier effect

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:22.363
you might be looking at

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.432
something in the area of two

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:24.966
hundred to two hundred and

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.500
fifty thousand jobs in

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:27.101
California I just to let you

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.536
know you your time is up but

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.571
wouldn't you see if you can

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.340
finish up I can finish. Types

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:34.608
of jobs with Cisco make two.

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:40.948
Recommendations sec. Some

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:41.515
specific recommendations in

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:42.850
these are hearing a little bit

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:46.654
but which had day. I think that

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:47.154
this work in the future

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.156
California there couple things

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:50.992
number one we need to hi what.

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:57.031
Arts lance. What for echo but

01:33:57.098 --> 01:34:00.801
you. Can get so a white tent

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:01.369
for managing forest products

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:06.540
manufactured. Yeah of that of

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.943
the work that. Out of

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.711
conserving is due which should

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:11.312
improve pro number the ascent

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:17.084
seer and it. And we see coming.

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:20.921
Really okay what and now it is

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:21.555
the issue. Thank supply a time

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:25.226
certain ten to twelve years at

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:25.826
minimum in order to catch the

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:26.861
light private your invest.

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:30.765
Increase pourtant. Low cost

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:34.869
it'll in. Last night whether

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:37.038
that be passed the chore Bob

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:38.639
the loan program turn absolute.

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:42.543
Says city this is an area of an

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:46.680
event for many people and I.

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:47.314
Think the one six what they the

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:50.551
money for I direct intervention

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.753
to kick stocks market. District

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.522
we talked about many of this

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:55.089
bio energy bio fuel back for

01:34:55.156 --> 01:35:02.663
any. Being lower. And the thing

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:03.264
that if that will later their

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.465
Chen include- mandates for

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.233
certain levels of production or

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:06.834
certain levels of consumption

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:07.334
for those as as cuenta

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:07.935
mentioned that would be very

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:08.502
important investment said

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.003
workforce education and

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.304
training as we're looking at

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:10.905
the work for supply chain here

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.540
there's very little kind of

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.442
communication between the

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.410
different workforce- education

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:18.312
and training programs so

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.481
identifying the gaps and

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.416
scaling the work force is

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.518
incredibly important and then

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.152
measuring the aborted casa co

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:26.487
benefits in order to

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.522
demonstrate. The return on

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:30.257
investment the California

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.560
taxpayers for standing up

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.462
markets for products like this

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:38.365
why is this beneficial to that

01:35:38.432 --> 01:35:40.468
the tax payer to actually

01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:41.001
invest in this and what is

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:42.503
social economic and

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.705
environmental benefit that they

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:48.409
get from it thank you very much.

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:49.043
Thank you Hey last August thank

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:52.646
you. When in concert bloom

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:54.748
grin- thank you for having me

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:55.349
here in my representing the

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:56.684
company could tear as a

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.519
defining us to stakeholders

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.621
that can help- California-

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:02.623
examine this opportunity for

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.492
mass timber in the in the state

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:06.660
I reside in Seattle could tear

01:36:06.727 --> 01:36:10.264
is a start up company- Silicon

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.764
Valley start up. Senate

headquarters in Menlo Park

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.468
looking to- it's always

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:15.002
humbling to say have been

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.570
disrupt the construction

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.339
industry with a new model of

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.274
and then service provider-

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:22.376
across- construction design

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:26.413
supply chain and- manufacturing

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.349
right now we have a five

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:28.949
thousand five hundred thousand

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:30.417
square foot. Facility in Tracy

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:32.386
California just coming online

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:36.290
that's making building products.

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:38.459
Why I'm here you know- to

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:38.959
testify is really I'm a

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:40.794
structural engineer that is my

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.563
background- six is simply to

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.732
find structural engineering is

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:46.534
the design of big things ms my

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.602
profession is involved in being

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.437
part of design teams to design

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:52.506
complex buildings- the me life

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.007
safety requirements the

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:56.343
building code I am not drawn to

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:57.011
technically challenging work in

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.812
the emergence of mass timber

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.481
building products and systems

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:02.516
for use in these big buildings

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:04.451
in North America markets has

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:06.620
provided ample opportunity in

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:10.491
that regard. So I hope is an

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:11.091
engineer occurs at just one

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.560
point of view the broad number

01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:14.695
of essential- Forrester frame

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.497
stakeholders necessary make

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.532
CLT. Success story in

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.334
California- the diversity of

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.570
people it takes to realize this

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.638
is broad and we need to

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.340
recognize that. Forced to

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.475
frame- that phrase is really.

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:30.377
The simple term just draw that

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:30.945
narrative of understanding

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:34.281
that. What starts as a- would

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:36.383
in a tree in a forest. Goes

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.285
through manufacturing to be

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:38.819
built on site and you're

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.354
dealing with stakeholders ago

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:40.921
from forest ecology Forest

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:44.458
economy. To a developer they

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.092
want to build for a fee and the

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:48.329
builder on site. And it's a you

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:48.963
have to understand all to do it

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:52.733
right- so here today as being

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.301
an engineer I want to.

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.704
Emphasize that point. One way

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.339
to get into that is we see CLT

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:00.474
and I think if you're from a

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:00.975
different part of that

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:01.542
stakeholder you look at the

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.676
product and you see it through

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.278
your lands of. Your area

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:04.845
expertise. As a structural

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.747
engineer and I look at the

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:08.582
material- I see that it's

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:10.517
comprised of renewable

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.653
resource. Grown by solar power

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.288
in which decisions are made-

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.490
starting at the sawmill or each

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:20.461
log from a tree. A is examined

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:22.396
in optimally cut to a

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:22.997
rectangular cross section to

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.665
mention. Each interval

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.600
individual board of lumbers

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.636
kiln dried. Surfaced in finally

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:30.437
evaluated and sorted based on

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.339
the individual physical and

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:32.940
visual characteristics of the

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:36.277
board. It's amazing technology.

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:36.844
That at my three years ago

01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:38.612
terror has let me- understand

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:42.549
more detail not size. Check

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.285
split slip of brain warp twist

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:44.852
cap when memo we those are

01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:46.487
words eighties every day in my

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.589
work. As you start to select

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.291
what the right type of what is

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:52.393
to make the end product based

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:52.993
on these rules and sorts each

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.895
board the sign to stress grade.

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.764
With specific design values and

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:00.367
then these design values- get

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.035
built up into that engineered

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:02.736
specified lay up. This is a

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.638
three ply CLT Shanshan you can

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.607
get them in three five seven

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:08.609
nine plies different stress

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:10.344
grades of lumber different lay

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:10.978
up thicknesses if you have to

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:14.415
get a catalog. Of your product

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.015
to really be viable in the

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:16.583
market place in here in North

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.285
America we can learn from

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:20.287
Europe. We're in a sense stages

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:20.754
of defining what that

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.589
standardized product here is

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:26.393
for us- and so in turn then

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.362
that product has its own design

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:28.962
values is an engineer we have

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.698
to have the building code in

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.499
the requirements so we can

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.468
specify the product properly.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:36.737
And make market competitive

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:42.376
building. In Iraq use. So in in

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:42.843
making CLT I nothing's

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:43.377
chemically change in the

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:44.678
material you can still see the

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:45.279
growth rings in material when

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:48.415
you look at the end of it. It's.

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.284
The process of making seal T.

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:50.918
takes naturally variable would

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.686
from any from nature and turns

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:54.521
it into technology. With

01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:56.623
defined and reliable

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:57.191
engineering properties it's

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:58.592
remarkable material here to

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:00.594
terror I work I've been

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.696
offered- great opportunity to

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:03.263
work at a company that has

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:06.433
conceived and built a two

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.034
hundred seven thousand square

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:07.601
foot CLT factory in Spokane

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.702
valley Washington. Over the

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:10.471
past three years. And as of

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.306
July the factories been

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:12.940
operational making could tears

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:16.310
first- certified product line

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:18.379
our factories located on the

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:18.946
edge of a large force plans

01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:20.414
news or near sawmill part

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:21.014
first. To the north and east

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:22.316
extending up to British

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:24.385
Columbia and Alberta we are

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:25.052
well positioned with good road

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:26.720
and rail access from the

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.722
sawmills to our factory an

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.457
intern good rail and road

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:34.361
access. From our factories to

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:34.995
the largest markets up and down

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:38.465
the west coast from- thank you

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:39.032
for British Columbia to San

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:40.734
Diego. The location are fact

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:42.469
exist as well the higher the

01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:42.970
experience we need from

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.571
forest's industry as well as

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:46.840
the component design computer

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:50.310
numerical control programmers.

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:52.579
And other in the technology

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.548
sector there I have to be in

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.517
our factory because the way the

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.585
materials fabricated uses state

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:00.220
of the art. G. in this

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:00.821
experience much else is gonna

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.456
determine the best sawmill

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:04.425
lumber specification for

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:04.858
sourcing that on his

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:10.397
performance which I care about.

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:10.998
And cost which everybody cares

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:14.468
about the raw material. Key

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.370
aspects of the spend. Them but-

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:17.004
you have to look at your lumbar

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.272
species company. For local to

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:18.839
your sawmills you know the

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:19.440
region alligator what's Beach

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:20.007
is an option. To terra is

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:20.774
supplying from Canada to fear

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:24.445
factory in Spokane. Because of

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:24.978
the S. P. F. species group

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:28.482
combination was- the selected

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:30.584
as our first- you're working

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.219
with sawmills the make lumber.

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:34.521
That's an attribute. A two by

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.356
six five quarter by six board

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:36.924
stock different lamination

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.659
thicknesses- which can come

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.761
from small diameter trees. Is

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:42.529
part of the analysis lumber

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.498
stress grade there's visual

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:45.065
grades there's mechanically

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:46.667
rated grades you have to get

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:48.635
into that specification. The

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.537
wood is kiln dried but it's a

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:52.306
keeping you discover- the

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:54.241
specification for steel T. is

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:54.908
different than lumber you have

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.376
to have dryer would. You need

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:58.278
other very- characteristics in

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:00.414
that product that are hard for

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:01.014
a sawmill that's in production

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:04.585
today servicing. Lumber the

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.820
mighty home depot these little

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:08.355
changes that we want of all the

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:08.956
little are not little to the-

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:10.290
manufacturing facility. You

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.226
need to get stakeholders

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:12.826
involved early to get some of

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:14.661
this mapped out- because early

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:16.497
adopters amassed timber- aren't

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:18.599
a big enough market for big

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.099
sawmills to change their

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:22.302
practice to meet our needs. So

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:22.903
you have to you have to work

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:26.340
together- and in the case could

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:26.974
tear this needs to be delivered

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.410
a high volume- when at capacity

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:32.346
our plans going to manufacture

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:32.946
up to hundred eighty thousand

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.715
cubic metres of CLT every year.

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.650
That's roughly eleven million

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:37.251
square feet of five five four

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:40.721
product. In a viable business

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:41.288
plan for CLT factors highly

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.489
dependent on lumber sourcing

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.391
strategy is roughly 7280% of

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.560
manufacture cost. Is the wood

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.428
fiber itself which makes sense

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:52.366
because it's 99% would. So at

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:52.966
the project scale frame I'm a

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:54.635
building engineer okay effected

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.336
terrace first commercial mass

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:56.837

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:34.975
making it a beautiful place to

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.810
work. But more importantly it's

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:40.480
been engineered to me. I'll

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.081

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:05.105
is the easiest material

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:06.473
fabricate and build with. Even

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.040
that big scale. Which is. So

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:10.510
different. Reporter like

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:12.779
charities catalyst building is

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:14.314
a demonstration of how to

01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:14.781
quantify the embodied

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.483
environmental impact of the- of

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:18.385
the building materials using.

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:20.454
Used including our seal to

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.356
product line to this we have

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:22.923
third party consulted with

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.758
Cartman carbon leadership

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.426
forum. And school of forestry

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:28.261
at the university of Washington

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:28.829
he is life cycle counting

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.597
methods that are now recognized

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:32.733
by- green buildings earthquake

01:44:32.799 --> 01:44:34.701
certification programs such as

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.470
the lead program. And in that

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:38.672
metric of measuring things in

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:40.641
comparing against other

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:41.174
buildings you constructed

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:42.676
account for carbon storage. And

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:46.380
the other benefits of would.

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:46.913
Lastly compared to tears

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.348
committed to sourcing our

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:48.982
lumber from responsibly managed

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.584
forests to meet the

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:51.084
specifications from our

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:52.686
customers we are currently

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:54.554
registry CLT factory the chain

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.623
of custody certified. That's a

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:58.525
five P. F. C. N. F. S. C. so

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:00.360
finish good product can be sold

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.329
with these credentials. In

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:04.498
conclusion if you respect the

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.132
material use it technically CLT

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:08.368
is a technology that enables

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:08.902
whole new ways to design

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.370
fabricate deliver build

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.272
environmentally responsible

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:12.906
buildings that people benefit

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:16.410
from living. And working in. I

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:18.311
think thank you very much. So

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:20.747
was it hard to get lead to work

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:24.384
with lead on this or do they

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:24.985
already have sort of a matter.

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:26.386
Of how they- yeah. Lead version

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:28.488
for. Which came of years ago

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:30.257
and when it comes out it's not

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:32.392
formally adopted some projects

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:34.528
but it generally it is. That

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.430
accounts for a whole building

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:38.265
at CA which is what I describe.

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:40.600
As a means to. Get points in

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:44.271
the system is set up to.

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:46.440
Encourage that kind of pushed

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:47.040
some of the builders. Who want

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:52.546
to serve. Kind of. Charter sort

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:53.046
of the educate it's an

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.748
education to the developer and

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:56.516
one issue with carbon in the

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:57.117
what that means the developer

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:57.751
you know we don't have we have

01:45:57.818 --> 01:45:58.685
water meters we have gas meters

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:00.253
we have electrical meters on

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:00.821
our buildings which have a

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.489
return on investment for

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:04.491
developer carbon doesn't have

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:06.626
that hook so I have not seen

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:10.564
employed too much- in the rear

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.198
view mirror but looking forward

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:14.401
in the future on- people

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:14.935
understanding operational

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.603
energy of a building is that

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:18.405
something we need reduce but to

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:20.640
be truly not zero you have to

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:22.342
look at the body then fax. Of

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:22.943
your structure how much energy

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:24.578
and carbon intensive and what

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:25.145
are the to the city of the

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:26.646
materials going in your

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:30.283
building that's that is the

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.884
conversation I moving forward

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:31.418
when you see architect and

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:34.287
engineer specifying the set

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.289
environmental impact of the

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:38.458
building materials which is

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:40.560
right in the center where the

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:41.128
wood. The maximum amount is

01:46:41.194 --> 01:46:44.664
operated. For this so yeah but

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:46.533
that's great. For if you're a

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.468
builder and you're trying to

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:49.002
get leads over certified

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.270
building or gold or platinum.

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.405
Is this something now that

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:53.039
would pop out as a way to help

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.875
get you there. Three it's there

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.476
it's an opportunity. The

01:46:56.543 --> 01:47:00.547
specialist consultant to do the

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:01.181
work in the feet it takes to do

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.382
that might be a barrier. Okay

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:04.718
thanks. So I have a question I

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:06.386
think for the two of you which

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.388
is you know there is a tension

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.390
between the bio mass generation

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:10.957
and you know utilizing the

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:14.494
material. For the mask timber

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:16.296
and I know that. There are some

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:18.431
stakeholders that are concerned

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:18.965
that if we build a lot of

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:22.335
broilers. Boilers and we- you

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:23.003
know do more generation plants

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.604
that they'll be more reason to

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.606
use more materials. For

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:28.575
generation rather than for

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:30.544
timber products so do you see

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:32.646
that man how do you if you're

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:36.449
doing a- of. A boiler on site

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:38.485
and you also have your timber

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.453
manufacture on site is there

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.087
sort of a tension between those

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:44.658
or is it only that. Your timber

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.293
manufactures again take best

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:46.927
mature all the materials to for

01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:48.495
that and it's kind of whatever

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:49.095
they can't use and is used for

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:52.499
the generation. The latter. So

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.434
that the what normally happens

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.670
in the way that we look at this

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.304
is if you can make use of the

01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:00.440
lowest value product the lowest

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:02.309
value materials the waste would

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.611
if you will. 185% of which is

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.646
not going into any wood

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.748
products your that's that's the

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.550
material that's appropriate for

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.452
biomass utilization and as I

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:14.588
think everyone knows it's a

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:16.489
heck of a lot better to burn it

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:18.592
in a boiler with pollution

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:20.493
control equipment. Than it is

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.094
to have open pile burning for

01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:22.762
us so it is a matter of getting

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.397
it to sight utilizing and when

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:24.865
we talk about a wood

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.733
utilization campus. We talk

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.570
about sort. Site to get things

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:32.539
into their highest how you use

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:34.608
and that can involve the whole

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.509
of the products so. We've ever

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:38.311
seen it as the tension so

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:38.845
that's gonna that's a site

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:39.346
where you have several

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:42.582
different types facilities what

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.216
about in places where they only

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:46.753
have. They're only doing

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.287
generation but they're not

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.755
doing production is that then

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:50.590
become an issue. It can be if

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:52.592
you're using larger material

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:56.363
that can be used for lumber or

01:48:56.429 --> 01:48:56.997
for cross laminated timber or

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.665
mass timber it can be an issue

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:00.667
absolutely yep I might weigh in

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.869
on that I think this is one of

01:49:02.936 --> 01:49:04.371
the reasons why we think we

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:05.005
have to be very clear from the

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:06.640
beginning that the goal is

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.608
Forest restoration. Is

01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:10.710
ecological management of our

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.646
forests and have some way to

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:14.614
measure manage that and ensure

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:16.583
that so that the materials that

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.318
are coming off that are used

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:20.320
for bio energy are essentially

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:20.854
a waste product they are

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.722
essentially a co benefit of

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:24.324
achieving an ecological

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.459
restoration objective not the

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:28.628
other way around. So that would

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.830
imply that these sort of sub

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:34.200
campus models where the highest

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:36.636
value product goes for embodied

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.805
carbon in buildings and other

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.473
things and really bio energy is

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.842
a waste product where you can

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:44.711
capture the heat and use the

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.713
heat to divert other fossil

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:50.617
fuel. General it embodied

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:52.552
energy would would be the best

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:54.287
approach to take if you were co

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:56.489
locating facilities in a

01:49:56.556 --> 01:49:58.391
forested landscape and then one

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.460
final element of that I think

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:00.994
Jonathan hit on something

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.562
really important right now the

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:06.333
alternative is essentially.

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:08.335
That waste product being open

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:10.303
pile burned in forests in

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:12.539
California- and the criteria

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:14.407
air pollution emission

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.476
reduction from from diverting

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:18.745
that- material to a bio mass

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:22.515
facility is roughly 97% of the

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:23.116
criterion air pollutants are

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:26.419
eliminated by diverting it to a

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:28.388
facility so. It makes sense

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.390
from an air quality perspective

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:30.957
first the supply issue is

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:34.594
concerned I don't think we're-

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:38.631
beginning to Dân. The supply

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:39.199
of high hazard sounded very

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:40.600
high hazard zone material that

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:42.402
was recently identified in

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:44.604
analysis done- across the

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:46.773
state- that showed literally

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.441
hundreds of millions of tons of

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:52.278
material needed to be removed.

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:52.912
Rich would you have particular

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:56.216
members in your association

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:56.816
that are interested in mass

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.618
chamber. Many other certain are

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.219
there certain members that are

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:02.389
just ready to go there. I would

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:04.758
say the there are members that

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:06.626
are excited interested in

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:10.663
exploring- whether they would

01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:14.334
go there tomorrow. Probably not

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:14.901
a and again it goes back to

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:16.469
this issue of. If they were

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:18.705
going to convert to a in

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:22.375
existing sawmill or add to the

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:24.244
facility necessary to make

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:26.446
across laminated timber. Of

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:26.946
that said a long term

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:30.450
investment- you're gonna need

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:31.084
to get loans from the banks the

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:32.519
banks are going to want to know

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:34.554
that. That's gonna pencil out

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:36.523
over ten twenty years it seems

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:37.123
like we've got this you know

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:38.691
huge future everybody's all the

01:51:38.758 --> 01:51:40.860
cool architecture using it and

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.529
you're about to have this new

01:51:42.595 --> 01:51:44.497
building standards and go to

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:45.031
eighteen stories and it's

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:46.766
cheaper. So what why still this

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.668
hesitation I mean I'm not and

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:50.670
you know I'm not an investor

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:52.739
but I was investor I kind of

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.407
feel like one of the first in

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:56.543
on this it just seems you know

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:58.445
almost too good to be true. So

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:00.447
why are they still hesitating.

01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:00.980
Well I think are you still

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:04.551
hesitating I'm. I guess the way

01:52:04.617 --> 01:52:06.386
would answer that is this.

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:10.757
Currently the timber companies

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:14.260
in California. Primarily

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:16.596
producing lumber from their own

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:20.733
Forest stock. And they're doing

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.267
that at a level that is

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:26.439
sustainable- for their lands.

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:28.708
The capacity for them to take

01:52:28.775 --> 01:52:29.242
additional stock off their

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:32.512
lands and maintain their

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:34.280
sustainability is minimal.

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.516
Therefore they need assurance

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:38.451
that there is material from

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:40.520
elsewhere not coming off their

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:42.422
own lands they any material

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:44.491
from the federal for us from

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:46.259
private other private non

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:46.793
industrial landowners of

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.595
developing those relationships

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.530
getting those securities in

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.565
place. Are the critical

01:52:52.632 --> 01:52:54.767
component for moving a cross

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:58.238
limited timber a production

01:52:58.304 --> 01:53:00.240
activity forward in California-

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:04.477
so it is the surely. Of supply

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.579
that is critical- I believe

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.648
that were very close to sure de

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:10.683
of market as you describe

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:14.254
what's happening- those are the

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:14.888
two elements that are gonna be

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:16.789
critical and in the final piece

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.525
is- the additional

01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:20.727
infrastructure that been talked

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:22.428
about this afternoon relative

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.597
to work force- so workforce

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:26.366
investment is also very

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:28.368
important. Of the final piece

01:53:28.434 --> 01:53:30.503
of that puzzle- but I believe

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.305
that we will get there and- I

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:34.307
believe that we will have a

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.609
cross Limón a timber- activity

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:38.444
a complete factory. Here in

01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:40.747
California- before long- but it

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:44.484
will take- some investment in

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:46.452
in figuring out how do we make

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:47.020
sure that we have long term

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:52.425
supply. May I add to that

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:53.092
briefly here. We visited the DR

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.460
Johnson Millen riddle Oregon we

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.529
spent the day with Valerie

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.498
Johnson the owner of that and

01:53:58.565 --> 01:54:00.466
she told the story of how in

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.602
sitting with twenty other folks

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.270
a ministry the said who's ready

01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:04.904
to make this and nobody step

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:06.606
forward. Immediately and she

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:08.908
said we can do it. But then she

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:10.810
told the story takes a number

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.478
of years to perfect the product

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.414
it's not like making a two by

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.449
four two by six piece of lumber

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:18.284
it's about the structural

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:18.952
integrity of the material which

01:54:19.018 --> 01:54:20.820
needs to be repeatedly tested

01:54:20.887 --> 01:54:22.622
and that's a that's an involved

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:24.257
process such as an expense

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:26.392
associated. And a time lag

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:27.026
associated with that and I just

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.428
want to underscore what rich

01:54:28.494 --> 01:54:30.663
pointed out. What she also said

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:32.532
you have a challenge like we

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:34.434
have here in rural California a

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.536
riddle Oregon and that is the

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:38.438
work force so we have to

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:40.273
continue to build the capacity

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:40.873
of the work force to do that

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.675
work. On it let me just ask I

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.677
mean us Hans ensure structural

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:46.546
engineer about the earthquake

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.681
issues- is this yeah that's a

01:54:48.748 --> 01:54:52.385
fair question I'd- yeah I am

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:52.986
now sitting on the codes and

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.520
standards that develops this at

01:54:54.587 --> 01:54:56.422
the national level for the

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:57.023
international building code

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:58.625
work. There is a- and I got to

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.526
speak in July- to the

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:02.629
California fair group that's

01:55:02.695 --> 01:55:04.397
considering the new code

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:08.468
language. Sell there is a- at

01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:09.135
the end of next year the twenty

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:10.703
twenty one. Provision of the

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:11.371
code will have a first CLT sure

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:12.672
Wall assuming the votes come

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.607
together it's sense of bass

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:16.843
process. So that's work that's

01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:18.544
done today on on using CLT as a

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:20.647
as a sheer wall system. It's

01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:22.582
still have limitations up to I

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:24.450
think five stories tall but

01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:28.554
it's a very. Hello the new

01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:30.290
lateral systems to get in the

01:55:30.356 --> 01:55:30.857
building code to have to go

01:55:30.923 --> 01:55:32.392
through a many years of testing

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:34.494
and development. And so that's

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.429
the good news I'm also on

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.598
researchers to Colorado State

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:39.198
University Kalra spuul minds.

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:44.837
There. Colorado school of mines

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:46.572
there's- there's in next

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:50.443
generation- systems coming out

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.977
so the next one three six

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:54.614
years. Next goofed to code

01:55:54.681 --> 01:55:55.214
cycles of systems will be code

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:58.284
five. Three six your code

01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:58.851
cycles we should have more

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.620
systems. In play in defining

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:04.490
the building code. But thank

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:05.058
you they want to thank the

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:06.726
panel I wanna thank all of our

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:08.695
panels- this is been really

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.630
interesting and certainly give

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:11.297
our committee a lot of work to

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:12.632
do and next year too. I'm never

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.467
gonna move to public comments

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.436
I'm ask the members of the

01:56:16.502 --> 01:56:17.036
public to keep their comments

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:18.504
to two minutes. Three are

01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:20.640
running. A little bit late

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:21.240
anybody would like to comment

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:26.713
please line up. Hey nobody of

01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:27.347
no one stands up I'm gonna bang

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:30.583
the gavel. Okay looks like

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:32.785
we've we answered all of the

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.587
concerns in the comments and

01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:35.188
anybody in the public could

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:38.458
possibly ever have so thank you

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:39.058
all again for coming and these

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:54.874
this meeting is adjourned
