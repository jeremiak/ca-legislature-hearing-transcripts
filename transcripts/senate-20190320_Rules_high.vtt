IT'S AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. FOR

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.413
THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.047
ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A RANGE

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.182
OF CHALLENGES --

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.884
THREATS TO NATURAL RESOURCES ARE

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.086
GROWING AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.454
CHANGE ISWORSENING DROUGHT

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.723
FLOODS WILDFIRES.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.158
SEA LEVEL RISE IN COASTAL

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.093
EROSION THREATEN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.561
OUR COASTLINE.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:49.896
ARE RISING TEMPERATURES IN THE

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.764
SO CALLED HEAT ISLAND COMPLEX

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:53.032
ARE GONNA THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.367
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.303
ARE IN YEARS AND DECADES TO COME.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.838
AT THE SAME TIME OUR POPULATION

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.773
IS GROWING YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.741
FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE OVER THE

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.109
NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.677
OUR ECONOMY IS EXPANDING ALREADY

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:05.912
THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.780
WORLD.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.548
THOSE ARE OF COURSE VERY GOOD

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.850
THINGS BUT THEY DO PLACE DEMANDS

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.452
ON OUR NATURAL RESOURCES I

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.687
INCLUDING WATER AND LAND.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.656
I'M AND THEN AND THEN THIRDLY AS

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:17.924
THESE CHALLENGES HAVE EVOLVED

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.126
OVER RECENT DECADES OF FUNDING

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.527
HAS NOT NECESSARILY KEEP KEPT

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.395
PLATE PACE.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.763
I PARTICULARLY GIVEN FEDERAL

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.165
DIVESTMENT IN AREAS LIKE A WATER

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:27.934
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.335
SO WHILE WE WERE WE HAVE THOSE

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.503
CHALLENGES TO CONTEND WITH I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.471
THINK E'RE REALLY WELL

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:32.505
POSITIONED TO TACKLE THEM HEAD

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.108
ON OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST WE

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.709
HAVE A LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:37.710
WHO HAVE PRIORITIZED AND

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.112
CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE NATURAL

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.647
RESOURCES.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:41.481
THINK ABOUT --

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.616
WILDFIRE AND FOREST MANAGEMENT

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.518
PRIORITY RIGHT NOW AND SENATE

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.086
BILL NINE A ONE THAT'S REALLY

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.521
PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:49.956
AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.025
CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE ALLOCATED

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.160
OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.294
LAST DECADE FOR NATURAL

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.496
RESOURCES.

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.264
COURSE PROPOSITION ONE THE WATER

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.866
BOND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN MOST

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.734
RECENTLY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.635
I IN JUNE.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.736
AND THEN MAYBE MOST PROBABLY

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.772
CALIFORNIANS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.440
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.007
WORKING TO DO WHAT NATURAL

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.342
RESOURCES.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.842
AND THAT IS PROTECT OUR

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.811
ENVIRONMENT I IN WAYS THAT

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:13.212
ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO UTILIZE OUR

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.714
NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.082
BENEFIT OF OUR QUALITY OF LIFE

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.950
AND IN OUR ECONOMY.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.385
SO WHAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES I

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:19.919
THINK WE'RE REALLY WELL

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.120
POSITIONED. TO ADDRESS HOSE

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.789
CHALLENGES.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.390
THEY'LL BE TO PRIORITIES --

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.159
THAT WILL GUIDE OR SHAPE A LOT

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.561
OF MY WORK I IT HOPEFULLY IN IN

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:29.962
COMING MONTHS AND YEARS.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.464
I'M ONE IS --

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.899
TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:33.666
NATURAL SYSTEMS BECOME MORE

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.902
RESILIENT TO THESE CHALLENGES.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:39.272
I'M SO NATURAL RESOURCES ON THE

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.707
A REAL TRINITY OF THREATS THE

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:41.941
FLOODS THE DROUGHTS THE WILD

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.142
FIRES.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.444
AND I THINK WE NEED TO REDOUBLE

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.279
OUR EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.281
PROTECT PEOPLE THE COMMUNITIES

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.649
ARE FROM.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:50.983
THOSE IMPACTS ON THOSE THREATS

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.152
IN OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS THE FISH

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.620
AND WILDLIFE THAT DEPEND ON THEM --

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.756
WE THINK ABOUT THE INTENSE FOCUS

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:57.457
THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.025
LEGISLATURE HAVE ON PROTECTING

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.827
COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.528
I IN THE WAKE OF THE CAMPFIRE IN

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.863
THE TRAGEDY IN PARADISE.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.665
THAT'S ONE CURRENT COMPELLING

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.400
EXAMPLE OF THE RESILIENCE THE

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.601
TYPE OF WORK WE NEED TO DO

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.002
BUILDING RESILIENCE.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.004
THE SECOND BROAD PRIORITY IS TO

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.506
BETTER CONNECTOR STRENGTH IN THE

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.274
CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE AND

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.944
NATURE PEOPLE AND NATURAL PLACES.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.912
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO FOLLOW THE

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.013
LEGISLATURE'S LEAD ON HELPING TO

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.515
IMPLEMENT.

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.984
A VISION TO EXPAND PARK ACCESS

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.919
TO ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.087
THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVING

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.023
COMMUNITIES NOW THAT HAVEN'T --

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.525
TRADITIONALLY BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.093
PARKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.062
THOSE PARTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.663
SO AS WE BEGIN THIS WORK --

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.265
AND AS I HOPE TO BEGIN THIS WORK

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.334
I MEAN I'LL I'LL APPLY AT LEAST

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.802
FOUR BROAD PRINCIPLES.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.438
NOT. TO TO THESE PRIORITIES.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.906
NUMBER ONE IS TO BE GUIDED BY

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.741
SCIENCE --

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.777
WE ARE LUCKY TO BE IN CALIFORNIA

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.211
WITH THE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.179
IN THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.114
THAT WE HAVE.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.182
NOW TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.617
COMPLICATED AND SO AND

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.485
EVERYTHING FROM WATER TO FISH

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.621
AND WILDLIFE TO FORESTRY WE NEED

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:02.955
TO WE NEED TO BE GUIDED BY YOU

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.090
KNOW OBJECTIVE SCIENCE AND

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.625
MONITORING [inaudible]

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.460
SECOND PRINCIPLE.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.528
THAT I REALLY WANT TO BRING TO

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.663
THE WORK IS TO BREAK DOWN SILOS

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.232
ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.433
AND MY EXPERIENCE IN STATE

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.935
GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.069
OFTENTIMES IN SUCH LARGE

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.038
ORGANIZATIONS EITHER CAN BE

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.406
REALLY A DISCONNECT.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.474
AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS AND

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.010
AGENCIES AND SO WHILE WE'RE ALL

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.578
WORKING TOWARD THE SAME MAN

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.747
OFTENTIMES THERE'S DUPLICATION

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.516
OR CONFLICT I WHEN WE'RE WHEN

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.017
WE'RE NOT WORKING TO BE

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:31.617
INTEGRATED.

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.553
THIRD PRINCIPLE IS TO PRIORITIZE

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.454
COLLABORATION WITH FOLKS OUTSIDE

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:36.422
OF GOVERNMENT.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.723
SO TO GET OUT OF THAT BUBBLE

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.258
THAT IS SACRAMENTO AND ACTUALLY

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.960
UNDERSTAND --

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.129
THE IMPACTS OF OUR WORK I'M

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.730
GROUPS LIKE OF FARMERS AND

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.465
FORESTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.900
CONSERVATION GROUPS.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.102
HI COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.604
SO WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:54.106
ACTUALLY IN PROACTIVE EMPHASIS

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.541
ON COMMUNITIES --

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.176
THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.611
PAST CONVERSATIONS.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.180
SO THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE THE

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.815
ELEVATION OF EQUITY I

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.050
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:04.984
AND IN THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE I

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.018
THINK WHICH IS IMPORTANT THIS

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.720
ROLE IS TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.055
TEAM.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.857
BUILDING ON THE TALENTED WOMEN

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.191
AND MEN WE HAVE A THE AGENCY

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.227
ALREADY MY GOAL IS TO BUILD A

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.229
DIVERSE TEAM --

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.097
WITH A SET OF LEADERS --

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.732
THAT KNOW THEIR WORK --

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.168
AND THAT WANT TO MAKE CHANGE AND

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.970
EMPOWER THEM TO EAD.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.705
I THINK THEY NEED TO DO REALLY.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.474
FOR THINGS FIRST IS REALLY SICK

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.009
TO UNDERSTAND ALL VIEW POINTS I

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.511
AM THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE.

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.546
ARE SECONDLY IS TO ROLL UP

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.448
SLEEVES AND ACTUALLY DIRECTLY

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.316
ENGAGE IN PROBLEM SOLVING --

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.918
AND TO AVOID.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:39.886
AN APPROACH WEBER JUST HAVE US

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:43.422
AGAIN IN THE RESOURCES AGENCY

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:44.857
REACTIVE BUT MUCH MORE PROACTIVE.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:45.625
NOW COMMUNICATE CAN

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.226
CONSTRUCTIVELY INDIRECTLY.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.028
I AND THEN LASTLY MAKE DECISIONS

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.830
IN A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AND

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:52.365
DECISIVE WAY.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:52.965
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO GET

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.768
DONE AND MY GOAL FOR OUR TEAM TO

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.536
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ON THE

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.771
LEGISLATURE OTHER AGENCIES

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.406
STAKEHOLDERS.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.141
GATHER INFORMATION WE NEED TO

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.175
AND THEN REALLY MAKE DECISIONS

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.510
AND MAKE PROGRESS IMPLEMENTING

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.045
POLICIES MADE IN THIS BUILDING

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.380
AND BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:08.881
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE WORK

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:09.982
AND AM EXCITED ANSWER ANY

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.419

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.339
CREDENTIALS AT YOUR WORK

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.107
EXPERIENCES EXTREMELY

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:36.976
SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT TO THE

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.110
TEST THAT --

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.112
YOU'VE BEEN --

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.213
DESIGNATED TO PERFORM SO

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.648
CONGRATULATIONS AND I DO LOOK

TO CONFIRM YOUR APPOINTMENT.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.690
WITH FOR THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.959
RODEO WITH RESPECT TO HAVING TO

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:55.194
DEAL WITH NATURAL DISASTERS IN

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.462
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.197
YOU'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.899
THAT WITH THE PER [inaudible]

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.500
ADMINISTRATION.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:05.004
SO AND BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:05.304
[inaudible]

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.640
VERY VERY.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:08.975
INTENSE EXPERIENCE I'M SURE.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.711
WHAT OURS OURS SPECIFIC OPTIONS

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.379
WITH RESPECT?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.480
TO ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE THE

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.649
SCOPE OF THESE FOREST RELATED

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.751
DISASTERS THE CERTAINLY HAVE

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.387
BEEN OUR IMMEDIATE PAST AND LOOK

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.423
TO BE OUR FUTURE.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.058
PERHAPS VERY VERY FAR DISTANT

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.594
FUTURE.

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.529
YEAH SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:31.697
HAVE TO PURSUE AN ALL OF THE

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.099
ABOVE APPROACH AND I'LL TALK

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:34.800
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:35.868
YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY FACING A

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.571
DOUBLE WHAMMY WHEN IT COMES --

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:39.839
TO WILDFIRE THREATS.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.273
ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE DRYER

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.442
FORESTS WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.844
TREE MORTALITY --

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.946
WE HAVE HEIGHTENED RISKS OF

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:50.082
THESE MEGA FIRES I LIKE WE SEEN.

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.184
AND AT THE SAME TIME OUR

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:52.685
DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.687
CALIFORNIA HAVE WORKED TO

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.056
SUPPRESS FIRES TO PROTECT LIVES

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.791
OVER A CENTURY.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:01.293
I AND SO WE HAVE FOREST'S THAT

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.895
ARE --

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:05.297
REALLY IN --

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:06.532
AND THE FIRES WITH EXPERIENCE OF

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.666
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS YOU

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.735
KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN EASILY THE

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:10.703
MOST DEVASTATING.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.738
WILDFIRE YEAR IN TERMS OF LOSS

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.206
OF LIFE AND PROPERTY.

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:15.508
SO PART OF THE ANSWER IS

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.643
ACTUALLY ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.045
OUR FORESTS --

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.614
BOTH AROUND COMMUNITIES AND MORE

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.915
BROADLY AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.083
GOVERNOR NEW SOME ON HIS FIRST

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.251
FULL DAY IN OFFICE ISSUED AN

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:26.786
EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING CAL

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.055
FIRE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:29.822
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.490
NOW. TO PROTECT VULNERABLE

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:32.925
COMMUNITIES --

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:34.593
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE TRAGEDY OF

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.228
WE MINIMIZE THE RISK OF THE

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.130
TRAGEDY OF PARADISE HAPPENING

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.465
THIS FIRE SEASON.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.300
ARE IN SO CAL FIRE ISSUED --

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.335
A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:44.236
SPENDING A LOT OF MY TIME RIGHT

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.772
NOW WORKING TO GET THIRTY FIVE

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.107
EMERGENCY PROJECTS ON THE GROUND

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.042
AROUND COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:50.509
TWO HUNDRED ON A BOOK

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.777
COMMUNITIES.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.344
SO THERE'S WORK IN THE FORCE

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.179
THAT WE NEED TO DO.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.880
BUT THERE'S ALSO WORK IN THESE

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.248
COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO DO --

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:57.450
AS I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.651
SOME OF YOU ABOUT --

00:11:58.717 --> 00:11:59.952
THE NATURE OF SOME OF THESE

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.320
FIRES IS --

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.122
HEAVILY WIND DRIVEN EVENTS SO IN

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.158
SOME FLAMING EMBERS --

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.661
FLOATING HEAD OF THE FIRE LINE

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:09.862
TWO THREE MILES --

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.297
AND SO WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:13.566
HOME HARDENING I THAT IS THINGS

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:14.900
THAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR EXISTING

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.435
HOUSING STOCK NEW HOUSING STOCK

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.204
TO PROTECT THOSE --

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.172
HOMES ARE FROM IGNITING.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:20.739
AND WE ALSO NEED TO REPAIR

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.441
COMMUNITIES --

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:23.509
OBVIOUSLY --

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.344
THERE ARE YOU KNOW ALMOST A

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.345
HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:27.746
IN PARADISE BUT WHAT'S LAST

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.515
KNOWN IN PARADISE IS THAT WAS A

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.816
COMMUNITY THAT HAD REALLY.

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.418
THRILLED QUITE EXTENSIVELY ON

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.652
EVACUATIONS.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.054
AND PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.722
WEREN'T MANY MORE DEATHS IS THAT

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:39.291
ACTUALLY THAT COMMUNITY

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:40.392
EVACUATED VERY QUICKLY.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:41.961
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.796
A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.231
STATE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:47.399

CAL FIRE IS PART OF THE SOLUTION

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.437
BUT WE HAVE TO WORK ACROSS

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.005

THE LIFEBLOOD OF AGRICULTURE IS

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.127
WATER -- SO

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:31.030
WHILE WE MODERNIZE OUR OUR WATER

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.398
INFRASTRUCTURE WATER MANAGEMENT

OUR CARBON --

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.118
WE CAN CREATE INCENTIVES FOR

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.486
FARMING PRACTICES THAT ACTUALLY

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.622
GENERATE ANCILLARY REVENUE

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.324
STREAMS FOR FARMERS --

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.778
A LOOK AT THAT IN TERMS OF THE

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.980
RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.615
DOWN IN OUR SOUTH COAST AREAS.

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.816
THEY HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW SAND

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.418

ACROSS THE STATE --

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.642
AND THERE HAS BEEN I THINK A

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.144
VALID CRITICISM IN THE PAST

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.746
ACROSS PROGRAMS --

GROWTH COUNCIL HAVE REALLY DONE

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.560
A DEEP DIVE IN UNDERSTANDING --

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.094

CHALLENGE WITH COASTAL

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:33.212
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW AND A

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.080
TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE.

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:35.747
ONE THE STATE'S APPROACH IN THE

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.916
AGENCY'S APPROACH IS NUMBER ONE

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:38.550
TO REALLY --

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.018
HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:41.854
UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE RIGHT IS

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.188
TERRIBLY COMPLICATED AND WHAT

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.656
COMMUNITIES ONE UNDERSTAND IS

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.358
WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE ON OUR

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.160
BEACHES ON OUR MARINO AS YOU

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.595

WE WORK TO REALLY TAKE WHAT IS

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.098
COMPLICATED PLANETARY SCIENCE

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.867
AND DOWNSCALE IT SO LOOKS SO

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.268
LOCAL LEADERS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.336
DECISIONS ON THAT.

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:01.340
AND THEN BUILDING OFF THAT ARE --

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:03.208
REALLY LIKE A A GUIDE BOOK OR A

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:04.610
PLAY BOOK FOR DECISION MAKING --

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.545
ON ON SEA LEVEL RISE SO THE GOAL

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:07.913
IS TO PROVIDE A LOT OF TECHNICAL

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.248
EXPERTISE THE SMALLER

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.616
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY DON'T

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.351
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE THAT

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.286
EXPERTISE IN HOUSE.

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.921
BUT THEN WE NOW HAVE OBVIOUSLY

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.189
UP TO HELP COMMUNITIES BE ABLE

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.390
TO AFFORD THE CHANGES THAT

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:19.458
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.626

APPROACH THAT EACH PARK.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.139

A STANDARD BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.075

CULTURAL FABRIC OF THOSE PARKS

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.222
IT'S A PART OF A CHALLENGE WITH

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:31.823
THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT IS?

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.558

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:18.730
YEARS.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:19.898
THAT REPRESENTS SKILLED OF

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.199
RESOURCES THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:24.269
CAL FIRE TO DO THE FORCE WORK

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:24.770
AROUND THESE VULNERABLE

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:25.670
COMMUNITIES --

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:26.772
BUT DIRECTLY I THINK IT'S AN

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.906
OPEN QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE'RE

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:30.308
GONNA RESOURCES BROADER WILD

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.710
FIRE SAFETY IN FORCE MANAGEMENT --

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:34.379
CHALLENGE ARE WE HAVE --

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:34.980
WILDLANDS IN THE STATE ABOUT A

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:37.516
THIRD OF IT'S FORESTED IN

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:39.017
OAKLAND AT CETERA.

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.852
AND A LOT OF THAT --

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.154
I WOULD ARGUE NEEDS TO BE

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.823
MANAGED AND THAT'S OF A SCALE --

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.825
THAT FRANKLY DWARFS THE GENERAL

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:48.260
FUND ABILITY.

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.828
AND SO THEN THE QUESTION IS.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:51.663
HOW DO YOU DEVELOP?

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.398
INCENTIVES I TO GET LOCAL

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.367
COMMUNITIES I AND OTHER PARTNERS

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.002
ON THE LAND TO ACTUALLY MANAGE

00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:57.803
THE LAND.

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:59.971
I. IN SO BIO ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:02.440
IS ONE I POTENTIAL SOLUTION

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:03.842
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED I THINK

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.644
IT'S A BROAD POLICY DIALOGUE

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.545
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN COMING

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.078
YEARS.

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:09.047
BUT I THINK THAT AND I KNOW THAT

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.348
THANK THINKS THE LEGISLATURE AND

RIGHT NOW THAT WE NEED TO

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.087

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:36.908
ON THE LOSING END OF A TREADMILL

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.476
NOT INVESTING ENOUGH IN OUR

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO WHERE

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:42.781
THOUGHT SON.

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:45.217
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CHALLENGES

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:47.319
WELL I I THINK THE KNOWLEDGE

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:48.520
KNOWLEDGE THEM AS A CHALLENGE --

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.988
I MENTIONED OVER TEN BILLION

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.289

BOND FUNDING THAT VOTERS HAVE

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.659
APPROVED I AND THAT FUNDING IS

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:55.794
REALLY VALUABLE.

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.996
I ENDED HAS GENERALLY BEEN FOR A

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:59.497
ONE TIME CAPITAL.

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.299
INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.901
WHAT GEO BONDS OR SPEND TIME.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.437
IN SO ONE AREA THAT I'M FOCUSED

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:06.972
ON IS REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.907
ARE THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:10.508
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN.

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.911

KNOW IT'S A WILDLIFE PRESERVE --

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.517
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.586
