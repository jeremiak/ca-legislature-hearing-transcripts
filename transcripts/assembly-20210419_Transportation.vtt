DONE ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO DO

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.609
MORE. GIVEN THAT RIVERSIDE IS

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.744

INCREASE MASS ADOPTION AND FORD

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:38.100
ABILITY OF SAID VEHICLES THE

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:42.104
BETTER. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.872
FROM SACRAMENTO IN PALO ALTO.

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.875
IN THIS BILL FOR AND I ASK MY

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:51.080
COLLEAGUES TO VOTE HI. THANK

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:54.617
YOU MISTER O'DONNELL. YES SIR

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.552
THANK YOU A MANAGER MY FIRST.

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:58.354
JUST QUESTION I'M LOOKING TO

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.889
THE ANALYSIS OF THE NEVER SEEN

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.691
THIS IN AN ANALYSIS BEFORE. THE

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.460
TALKS ABOUT SUPPORTING AND

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.196
CONCEPT. SO THEY DON'T SUPPORT

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:09.264
THE BILL BECAUSE THE NOW SO

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.033
SHOULD BE ABOUT THE BILL NOT

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.635
CONCEPTS I MEAN I SUPPORT THE

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:15.037
CONCEPT OF WHAT'S BEFORE US

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.839
TODAY IN FACT I THINK. MANY OF

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.173
THOSE IN OPPOSITION SUPPORT THE

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.276
CONCEPT OF MAYBE NOT THE BILL.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.511
SO COULD COULD I GET SOME

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.146
CLARIFICATION ON FROM THE

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.882
AUTHOR OR FOR ME OR I JUST

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:27.916
DON'T KNOW WHAT SUPPORT AND

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:30.119
CONCEPT. MEANS IN THE CONTEXT

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.388
OF AN ANALYSIS. WELL I CAN

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.189
SPEAK ON BEHALF OF STAFF-

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:36.091
BECAUSE I WORK WITH THEM ON BUT

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.093
THE ANALYSIS WAS GOING TO SAY.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.462
AND BASICALLY WE BELIEVE THAT

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:41.163
THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.364
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:45.334
CONTINUE FUNDING- SEVEN SEVEN

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.369
SENTENCE. AND WHILE WE THINK

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:50.172
THAT THIS BILL DOES HAVE- THERE

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.707
ARE CONCERNS BUT WE FELT THAT

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.842
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:56.578
THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION- SO

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.147
THAT'S- KIND OF WHERE THE

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.882
SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT RIGHT WE

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:00.783
SEE THIS BILL AS BEING

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:01.517
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:04.186
CONTINUE TO BE WORKED ON AS IT

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:04.753
MOVES THROUGH OUR HOUSE AND

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.455
THROUGH THE SENATE. AND SO WE

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:08.290
WERE JUST SUGGESTING THAT THE-

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.025
AUTHOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.193
THE STAKEHOLDERS TO WORD OF

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.996
LABOR TO WORK WITH KERR- TO TRY

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:17.900
TO- FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY. TO

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.301
APPROACH THIS VERY IMPORTANT

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.370
GOAL OF CONTINUING TO FUND

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:24.006
SEVEN CENTERS OKAY. GREAT JUST

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.607
AS A MEMBER JUST ONE OTHER. BY

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.243
MIKE MY CONCERN THAT WE START

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.244
ABOUT SUPPORTING THINGS IN

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.679
CONCEPT IT SHOULD REALLY BE

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:31.980
ABOUT THE BILL ITSELF I DO

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.749
AGAIN SUPPORT THE CONCEPT I

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.751
REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:36.318
PROBABLY DONE MORE THAN ANY

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.721
OTHER IN THE STATE. TO REDUCE

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.522
MOBILE SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.624
BECAUSE I HAVE THE TWO PORTS. I

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.259
SAW A MAJOR FREEWAY THAT RUNS

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.228
THROUGH IT SO I WELL KNOW THEY

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:49.164
NEED. TO CLEAN OUR AIR I DON'T

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.933
KNOW THAT THIS BILL TO I CANNOT

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.801
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.036
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:55.104
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.872
NOTABLE HONOR TO IS ANOTHER

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.041
REVIEWED. ARTICLE LISTED ON HER

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.542
WHO TYPICALLY ARE STAKEHOLDERS

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:02.578
IN DISCUSSIONS LIKE THESE AND I

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:05.147
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.115
TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.016
FORWARD. BUT I JUST THINK THERE

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.885
NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.019
STAKEHOLDER INPUT. IN THIS

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:14.022
EFFORT- SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.291
AGAIN I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:17.392
HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THE

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:18.927
WORKING CLASSES THOSE ARE THE

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.262
FOLKS THAT BY. THE KIND OF

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:22.297
VEHICLES THIS TARGETS TO SOME

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:25.267
EXTENT. AND I BELIEVE I WOULD

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.402
MAKE THE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:30.506
AND THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR ME.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.306
TO JUST TARGET THOSE

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:32.541
HARDWORKING FOLKS BECAUSE THE

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.309
TYPES OF VEHICLES THEY HAVE TO

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:36.645
BUY ARE TYPICALLY. NO HEAVIER

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.213
DUTY IF YOU WILL THAN A THAN

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.048
JUST A SIMPLE PASSENGER

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.818
VEHICLE. SO THAT I AGAIN I

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:45.888
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S- DESIRE

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:46.755
TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.390
FORWARD I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:51.226
BILL BUT I DO SUPPORT CONCEPT

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:51.794
THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:58.500
NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.102
WE WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR I

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.504
SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AS WELL AND

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:03.839
I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.741
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.109
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE NEED

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.278
TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS-

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:10.846
ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.247
AND THE VISION HE'S TRYING

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.283
OUTLINED BUT- DOING SOMETHING

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:17.319
THROUGH. A EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:20.656
DOESN'T NECESSARILY. ALLOW THE

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.624
DEBATE AND THE DISCUSSION AND

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.593
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.929
TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SO I

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.831
ACTUALLY THINK THE AUTHOR OR

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.766
THE AUTHOR'S FOR BRINGING THIS

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:31.900
BILL FORWARD AND I DO THINK

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.068
THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS THE

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.203
APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR US TO

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:38.273
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND I

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.144
GUESS I. YEAH I HAVE A FOR A

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.246
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE-

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.447
TODAY I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:50.252
BUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.120
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:52.921
TRYING HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.224
ACCOMPLISH THIS EVEN I BELIEVE

01:14:55.290 --> 01:15:00.462
CARP HAS LESS RESTRICTIVE-

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.564
AVENUES OF GETTING TO THEIR

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:06.568
GOALS AND IN THIS BILL I THINK

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:07.369
IT'S BEEN EXPEDITED WHEN YOU

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.705
LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE 10% LOWER

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.374
THAN THE BASELINE BETWEEN

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:14.009
2322530% LOWER THAN BASELINE

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.111
BETWEEN TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.312
NINE BUT THEN INSTEAD OF WHAT

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:20.282
CARD RECOMMENDS THAT 40% THIS

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.217
BILL JUMPS UP TO SIXTY PERCENT.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:25.587
FOR IT TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:26.421
THIRTY FOUR SO IF THE AUTHOR

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:29.024
WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT I'D

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:32.961
BE INTERESTED TO HEAR- HOW.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.329
REALISTIC THAT'S GONNA BE AND

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:38.066
ALSO WHAT IMPACT- THAT ARE ARE

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:40.602
GONNA BE FELT BECAUSE AS THE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.104
THAT AS MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.740
SPOKE FROM LONG BEACH THERE IS

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:48.176
A CONCERN ABOUT HOW. THE OLD

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.711
TECHNOLOGY DOVE TAILS WITH THE

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.580
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND IN THAT

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.582
PROCESS YOU DON'T WANT THE

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.517
BURDEN OF THAT COST BEING

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:59.388
PASSED DOWN TO CONSUMERS- AND-

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.657
IF THE IF MADAM CHAIR WILL

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:02.257
ALLOW I HAVE A SECOND QUESTION

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.359
AS WELL. LET THE AUTHOR RESPOND

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:07.796
TO THIS ONE FIRST. SURE I THINK

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.565
THAT THE QUESTION AS FAR AS

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.701
THESE- THRESHOLD NUMBERS IN

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.270
HERE VERSUS CARP AND THINK THAT

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.906
CHANGE THE LAST FEW YEARS IF

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:20.709
NOT MONTHS- SEVERAL LARGE AUTO

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.110
MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING GENERAL

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:25.213
MOTORS SAID A VERY LOFTY PLAN

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.016
TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT-

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.685
NON INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:32.654
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS SIMPLY

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.822
NOT. NOT TEN YEARS TO TWENTY

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.990
THIRTY FIVE. SO WHAT WE'RE

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.725
DOING HERE IS THE THING OKAY

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:39.661
DON'T JUST TELL US SHOW US AND

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.964
GIVE IT'S A VERY WE THINK.

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.066
QUANTIFIABLE MARKERS AND THE

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.702
TENT BECAUSE IT ALSO SAYS BY

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:47.302
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NEED TO

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:49.271
BE 10% LOWER THAN BASELINE TO

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.406
BASELINE IS NOT TODAY. WHEN THE

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.808
BILL COMES IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.210
THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THE

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.611
BASS LINE IS TWENTY TWENTY

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.580
FIRST ST GOING BACK TO TWENTY

01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:59.815
TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.985
NEED TO BE TEN PERCENT. LOWER

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.353
ANY CAN OVERALL EMISSIONS FROM

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.788
YOUR FLEET. SO DON'T JUST TELL

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.991
US SHOW US SHOWS THAT YOU'RE

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:11.193
DOING AND STEPPING UP- I KNOW

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.494
THE OPPOSITION TO RACISM

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.562
ARGUMENT TO THIS IN THE IN THE

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.998
LATER. YEARS AS WELL WE GO TO

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.099
THIRTY SIX PERCENT. YOU KNOW

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.667
THESE ARE THREE THRESHOLD THE

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.435
NUMBERS THAT WE'D BE WILLING TO

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.970
NEGOTIATE BUT THE GOAL HERE IS

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.973
CALIFORNIA SHE REALLY PUSHED.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.908
THE INDUSTRY NOT TO JUST TELL

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:27.776
US THEY'RE DOING THIS BUT

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.478
REALLY HAVE SOME. QUANTIFIABLE

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:34.049
MARKERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO-

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:34.649
YOU KNOW OUR CLEANER GOALS IN

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.985
CALIFORNIA. IT IS VERY TO

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:41.089
ANOTHER QUESTION. I DO I- I

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:41.723
THINK I STILL HAVE SOME

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.158
QUESTIONS ON THIS FIRST ONE AS

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.426
WELL BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.294
UP ALL THE TIME. IT'S SOMETHING

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:48.230
THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.932
NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON- I

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.267
AM CONCERNED THAT THERE IS

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.870
GOING TO BE SOME- AND IMPACT

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.706
FELT AMONG CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:00.876
THAT- WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:05.347
AND NO AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION.

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.449
TO ALLOW THE NEW GENERATION OF

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.085
FOLKS BECOME. CLEANER VEHICLE

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.421
DRIVERS IS GONNA SUFFICE

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:13.588
POTENTIALLY WITHIN CERTAIN

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:16.525
DEMOGRAPHICS I. MAYBE YOU CAN

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.427
SPEAK TO THIS BUT I JUST. MADE

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.195
AND MAYBE I'M TRYING TO GET

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.363
INTO THE WEEDS TOO MUCH BUT I

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.264
FEEL LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.932
SUB GROUP THAT'S GOING TO BE.

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.401
SEVERELY IMPACTED AND I THINK

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:27.936
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FIGURE

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:28.970
OUT HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:31.239
ADDRESSED- LET ME JUST GET TO

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:34.009
THE SECOND QUESTION. OF JUST TO

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:35.610
CLARIFY BY THE WAY THERE THERE

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:38.246
WILL BE PENALTIES FOR SELLING

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:41.383
BUT NOT FOR PRODUCING. AND IF

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.186
THAT'S CORRECT THAT SOMEONE. IN

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.754
MY HUMBLE VIEW WEAKENS THE

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:47.856
ARGUMENT OF WHERE WE STAND AS A

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:49.825
STATE AS WELL SO I'M NOT SAYING

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.127
WE SHOULD- BAND- PRODUCTION OUT

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.495
RIGHT WORK PENALIZE THE

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.297
PRODUCTION AS WELL BECAUSE

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.365
THAT'S THE JOB MARKET BUT BUT

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:59.267
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING HOW WE

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:00.836
WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE WILLING

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.872
TO. PENALIZE THE SELLING BUT

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:07.409
NOT THE PRODUCTION SO IF YOU.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:07.976
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO COMMENT TO

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:12.581
THOSE I. HAPPY TO TAKE IT.

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:13.815
WITHOUT ANY MORE QUESTIONS

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:16.751
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YEAH

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.819
THERE THERE'S A FEW THINGS

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.688
THERE AS FAR AS THE IMPACT ON

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:22.390
CONSUMERS. WELL FIRST OF ALL WE

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.658
HOPE THAT THIS PENALTY WILL

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.460
NEVER COME TO FRUITION THERE IS

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:28.597
A GREAT. S. ABILITY AND WE HOPE

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:32.000
BY NUDGING. THE INDUSTRY TODAY

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:33.201
WILL GIVE THEM A COUPLE YEARS

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:34.503
TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT THEIR

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.538
PLANS ARE TO CREATE MORE ZERO

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:37.873
EMISSION VEHICLES SOLD HERE IN

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.941
CALIFORNIA SO JUST ON THE

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.244
NATURAL HALF OF THE OTHER

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.778
MANUFACTURERS WON'T HAVE THIS

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.080
IMPACT AT ALL YOU KNOW THEY

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.215
WOULD JUST BE BENEFIT LOAN CAN

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.117
CONSUMERS WILL BE ABLE TO BUY

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.086
ZERO MICHIGAN VEHICLES. AT A

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.854
LOWER RATE OUR GOAL IS TO

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.823
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REBATES

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:55.690
OUT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.225
INCREASE THEY GET THE AMOUNTS

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.060
TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE VIABLE

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.295
TO FURTHER SUPPORT SPUR

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.864
INTERESTED SO I THINK. IT'S THE

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:09.037
OPPOSITE. OKAY ANY OTHER

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.338
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISTER

LEGISLATURE TAKEN THE BALL BACK

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:32.227
IN TERMS OF POLICY MAKING

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.262
ESPECIALLY ON THESE BIG ISSUES

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.997
THAT WERE GOING TO STRUGGLE.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.766
WITH TO MEET OUR CHRONICLES

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:40.602
AND- I HAD TO SORT OF IN

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.171
RELATED QUESTIONS AND THEY'RE

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.040
THEY'RE SIMILAR- TO. WHAT THE

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.308
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM LONG BEACH

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:47.709
WAS COMMENTING BUT I'M CURIOUS

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:50.045
AS TO WHETHER. I MEAN THE FIRST

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:50.812
ISSUE SORT OF CHARGING

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.714
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CURSED ME IF

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.149
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A HIGH

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:57.018
ADOPTION RATE OF SAYS- WE NEED

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:57.652
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARGING

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.754
INFRASTRUCTURE. ESPECIALLY WITH

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.756
MODELS OBSERVES THAT ARE MORE

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:02.490
LIMITED IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:05.093
RANGE- IS ADEQUATE AND

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.328
UNDERPINNING THE CHARGING

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:07.462
INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO MAKE

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:10.665
SURE WERE. PRODUCING ENOUGH

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:11.833
ELECTRICITY ENOUGH ELECTRONS.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.767
AND THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO DO

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.736
THAT. IN A WAY THAT'S A

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:16.738
POSITIVE IN TERMS OF GHG

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.940
EMISSIONS FREE- PRODUCTION

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.909
SOURCES AND- SITTING ON THE

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.444
UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.112
FOR FOUR YEARS I'M NOT SURE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.046
THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE A PLAN

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:27.215
TO DO THAT. I'M SKEPTICAL THAT

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.050
WE DO SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS.

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:30.752
HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN HAS

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.654
BEEN STUDIED. IS THERE SOME

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.822
SORT OF STUDY OR SOMETHING

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:36.791
SOMETHING TO POINT TO SUGGEST.

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.159
WHERE AT IN THE CHARGING

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.894
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE A

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:42.097
LARGE SCALE ADOPTION OBSERVES.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:42.864
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.066
WHICH IS SHORTER. IS HAS THERE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.468
BEEN A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.703
IMPACT ON. ON PRICE AND

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.106
THEREFORE IMPACT ON- ACCESS TO

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.607
VEHICLES FOR THE FOR WORKING

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.542
CLASS MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILIES

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:56.244
AND HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE IF YOU

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:57.812
YOU KNOW JUST LAW OF SUPPLY AND

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.080
DEMAND ECONOMICS IF YOU

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.316
CAPRICORNUS IN PARTICULAR

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.651
THING. YOU TEND TO DRIVE THE

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.686
COST OF THAT THING UP. AND I'M

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.422
WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S BEEN

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.124
SOME SORT OF ANALYSIS OF THAT.

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:10.959
THAT'S WHAT THE FIRST QUESTION

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.927
ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.262
1100% CORRECT IF WE STARTED

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:15.664
THIS TODAY AND HAD A TENFOLD

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.699
INCREASE BY NEXT YEAR. IT WOULD

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.334
BE A DISASTER WHICH IS WHY I

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:21.202
THINK THAT. IF HOW WE'RE

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.038
LOOKING AT THIS NOW WE'RE

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.773
SAYING BY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.508
FOUR. YOU WANT TO BE SIXTY

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.843
PERCENT. GREATER THAN WHAT WE

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.479
WERE. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.148
YEARS AGO THE ROUGHLY 50%

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:35.183
IMPROVEMENT IN TEN YEARS. I

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.519
THINK TEN YEARS GIVES US ALL A

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.387
GOOD TIME TO INCREASE. OUR

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.423
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE NOW THE

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.258
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS A SERIOUS

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:45.026
INVESTMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.262
OF CHARGING STATIONS. I KNOW I

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.496
HAD THE BILL THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.131
OTHERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.866
AFTER FOR THAT GOAL THEIR THERE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.835
ARE ARE NOT ENOUGH. BUT IF

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.470
PEOPLE WE NEED IT CHARGING

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:56.871
STATIONS FOLLOW THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.406
VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

01:22:58.473 --> 01:22:59.908
AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ROUGHLY

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:02.544
EQUIVALENT NOT. PROBABLY ENOUGH

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.379
THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:07.248
RAMP UP. AS FAR AS THE OVERALL

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.384
COST I THINK THAT'S JUST A RED

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:10.452
HERRING EUROPE POLICY IF YOU

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.187
LOOK. AT HOW THIS BILL WOULD

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.155
WORK. THERE ARE SOME AUTO

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.124
MANUFACTURERS UNLIKE AND NAME

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:19.294
THEM HE BY NO THERE'S IT HALF A

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.730
DOZEN- SO IT. THAT ARE ON THEIR-

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.932
GUARANTEED TO NOT HAVE TO MEET

01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.800
THIS THRESHOLD AND THEY'RE

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.435
GOING TO BE SELLING CARS AT THE

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:30.338
LOWER END. OF THE COST RAPTURE

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:32.474
THAT ARE AT PAR WITH INTERNAL

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.376
COMBUSTION ENGINE SEDAN. AS

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:36.211
WELL LETTER STATES. AND IT'S

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.512
THE SAME PRICE BUT YOU KNOW

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.347
WHAT YOU DON'T TO PAY FOR GAS.

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.249
RIGHT SO IT'S EVEN LOWER SO TO

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.784
SAY THAT'S GONNA WAS GONNA BE.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.253
MORE EXPENSIVE. FOR WORKING

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.988
CLASS CALIFORNIANS I THINK THE

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:47.989
OFFICE LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:49.324
THAT LIVE. IN THE CENTRAL

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.126
VALLEY AND HAVE TO COMMUTE TO

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.827
THE BAY AREA. YOU KNOW THERE

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:55.630
THERE'S A HUGE COST FOR THEM.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.966
AND RIGHT NOW THAT DID THAT I

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.267
DON'T KNOW THE WHITE INDIVIDUAL

01:23:59.334 --> 01:23:59.868
MORE PEOPLE ARE DOING IN THE

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.836
FIRST PLACE. LARGE PART TWO IS

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:04.139
IT'S- THE REBATES AREN'T ALWAYS

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.940
AVAILABLE AND IS ON A CHARGING

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:06.908
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT AS WE MOVE

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.443
ALONG. THAT'S GOING TO

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:09.844
COMMUNITY INCREASE AND IT'S

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.147
GOING TO BE EVEN CHEAPER AND

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:15.950
IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:16.418
GREATER IMPACT ON OUR

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:21.423

PENALTY AT ALL. ACTIONS LIKE

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.468
THESE ARE PROOF THAT THE BILL'S

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.270
GOAL OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.372
FUTURE. ISN'T JUS ASPIRATIONAL

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:18.172
BUT IT IS REALISTIC AND

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:20.108
ACHIEVABLE. IN THE BILL SHOULD

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.242
BE VIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

ACTIONS ANNOUNCED. BY AUTO

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:25.547
MAKERS ALREADY. JUST MAKE BUT

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:27.115
JUST MAKING MORE ZERO EMISSION

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.483
VEHICLES IT WON'T SOLVE THE

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.751
PROBLEM. AND THE COMMITTEE

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.352
STAFF CONCISELY SUMMED UP THE

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.921
CHALLENGE IN THE BILL ANALYSIS.

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.856
NOTING THAT AND I QUOTE.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.058
EXPONENTIAL GROWTH WILL REQUIRE

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:37.792
A STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE VEHICLE

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.394
SALES. THROUGH STANDARDS

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.162
IMPOSED ON AUTO MANUFACTURERS

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:42.897
INCENTIVES. TO ENTICE

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.866
CONSUMERS. AND TO INCREASE THE

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.167
AVAILABILITY OF CHARGING AND

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:47.969
FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE I AGREE.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.103
WITH THE CONCERN AROUND THAT

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.838
BUT- YEAH WE CAN'T SAY WE

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.140
EXPECT. YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:53.608
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING LIKE

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:54.208
TWENTY THIRTY FOUR WHY IS IN

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.810
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ALREADY

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.745
EXIST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE

01:26:57.812 --> 01:27:00.682

GOALS THAT WE'VE SET. SO THIS

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.293
BILL IS NOT ONLY ALONG WITH THE

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.295
AUTOMAKER'S PLEDGES. BUT IT

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.130
TAKES THE NECESSARY NEXT STEPS.

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.832
TO INCENTIVIZE THE SALE OF ZERO

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.768
EMISSION VEHICLES- SO I-

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.704

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.365
ROBUST AND VERY. I THINK

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.567
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. ABOUT

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:48.703

SHARE OF CLEANER AIR AND MOVING

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.609
TO IS THAT FUTURE. AND I DO

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.545
THINK THAT- THE DISCUSSIONS

01:31:57.612 --> 01:32:00.748
ALSO REVEALED- THE- THE

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:02.617
STRENGTH OF THE BILL. DID YOU

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:03.751
KNOW THAT THE DESIRE IN THE

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.187
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A HAND. IN

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.288
THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.523
EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOUT- THIS IS

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:11.692
ROLLED OUT. A RECOGNIZING THAT

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.761
WE HAVE LOFTY GOALS ARE SET BY

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:16.097
GOVERNOR NEWSOM BUT- WE ALSO.

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:16.731
NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:19.100
MECHANICS OF HOW TO DO THAT AND

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:19.667
THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.669
LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT- BUT

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.537
ALSO LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:26.941
THIS BILLS- ABILITY. TO DO THAT

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:29.944
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:30.778
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN. THE IDEA

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:32.179
OF HAVING A FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.414
INCENTIVES THAT AT LEAST AT

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.483
THIS POINT WE NEED. FOR A LOT

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:36.250
OF OUR CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:38.119
APPS. AND THESE BILLS ALSO

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:39.987
STATED GOAL OF NOT ACTUALLY

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.856
HAVING TO HAVE FINES. I THINK

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:44.825
THAT THAT IS A- BIT OF A-

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:45.960
DILEMMA WITHIN THE BILL THAT

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:50.398
NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED- AND- YOU

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:51.766
KNOW IF THE IF THE GOAL REALLY

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:54.302
IS THE C. B. R. P. FUNDING I

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:56.003
THINK THAT THIS. WE DO NEED TO

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.405
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITHIN

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.706
THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL TO

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.707
REALLY MAKE THAT SOMETHING

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.542
THAT'S CLEAR AND THAT DOESN'T

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.511
DO ANY DAMAGE TO A- LOW INCOME

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:04.946
COMMUNITIES TO PEOPLE'S ABILITY

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:08.149

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.933
TOPICS THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:26.667
IMPORTANT THAT THE BILL DOES

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:29.070

SB ONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.830
DID INCREASE THE FEE WOULD CALL

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.431
THE TEST AS THE FIRST DAY. OF

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.834
THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND SO I

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.435
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.770
TO ADDRESS AND IF THIS IS

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.171
HAPPENING ANYWAY LOOK IT SAYS.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.140
SOMETHING LIKE THIS ISSUE. BUT

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:47.308
THEY SHOULD SOMEONE TALK TO THE

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.375
OTHER MANUFACTURERS THEY'RE

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:50.077
DOING THIS ANYWAY. WE'RE JUST

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:52.046
SPEEDING IT UP. AND SO AS WE GO

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.582
DOWN THIS ROAD. NO PUN INTENDED

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:55.916
WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.451
FUNDING FOR OUR ROADS.

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:58.752
CONSTRUCTION ARE FIVE BILLION

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.421
DOLLAR A YEAR FUN FOR THESE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:01.889
GREAT CONSTRUCTION JOBS BUT

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.457
ALSO REALLY. ARE SO IMPORTANT

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:05.659
TO. OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TO

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.495
MAKE SURE IT'S NOT BASED UPON.

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:09.497
A GAS SALES THAT BASED UPON-

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:10.264
THE FEE ON THE ON THE

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.966
AUTOMOBILES IF THEIR ZERO

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:12.967
EMISSION VEHICLE OR INTERNAL

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:14.935
COMBUSTION ENGINE SO. I THINK

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:15.803
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.671
ADDRESS. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.540

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.760
NOW IN THE MAKING OF THIS IS A

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:48.529
BILL THAT PRIMARILY LOOKS AT

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:51.065
WAYS OF REDUCING OF GIVING

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:53.234
CITIES THE FLEXIBILITY OF BEING

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.636
ABLE TO CAPS SPEED LIMITS. TO

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:58.005
REDUCE TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:00.474
TRAFFIC INJURIES. THANK YOU WE

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.575
ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THIS BILL

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.544
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- AND

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:05.646
CHAIRED THE DENTURE FRAZIER.

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:06.981
INSTEAD ASSETS TO CONVENE A

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.083
TASK FORCE WHICH IN HINDSIGHT

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:10.351
WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY REALLY

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.719
SMART THING TO DO BECAUSE WE

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.053
PUT TOGETHER A TASK FORCE OF

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.154
STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL ACROSS

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:16.190
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAD

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.325
TRIPLE A WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.026
WE HAD THE SAFE STREETS

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.628
ADVOCATES HE REALLY BROUGHT

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:21.829
EVERYONE TOGETHER FROM URBAN

01:38:21.895 --> 01:38:23.998
AREAS FROM RURAL AREAS. AND

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.034
FOUND. THAT SPEED IS A PROBLEM

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:28.135
THAT'S KILLING PEOPLE ACROSS

01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:29.603
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:31.005
THAT CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.606
HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS ASKING FOR

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:34.241
SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM THE VERY

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.609
RIGID RULES THAT SET SPEED

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:36.277
LIMITS IN THE STATE OF

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:38.479
CALIFORNIA. BASICALLY THAT IN

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:39.813
ORDER TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.282
CITIES HAVE TO DO A TRAFFIC

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.117
SURVEY VERY TEN YEARS. THEN

01:38:43.183 --> 01:38:44.018
THEY HAVE TO SET THEIR SPEED

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:46.086
LIMITS AT THE EIGHTY THE EIGHTY

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.288
FIFTH PERCENTILE OF HOW FAST

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.922
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING REGARDLESS

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:50.291
OF WHETHER THEY'RE SPEEDING.

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:52.126
THIS FORCES CITIES TO

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.927
CONSTANTLY RAISE SPEED LIMITS

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:55.462
REDUCED RESULTING IN A KIND OF

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:58.165
SPEED CREEP REGARDLESS OF THE

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.833
WISHES OF THEIR RESIDENTS TO

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.337
CONTROL SPEEDING ON OFTEN

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.571
RESIDENTIAL STREETS. LAST YEAR

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:08.575
DURING CODED WE HAD A- 13% DROP

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:09.943
IN THE MILES THAT WERE DRIVEN

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.512
IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.614
WERE STAYING HOME. WHAT

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.416
HAPPENED IN TERMS OF FATALITIES

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:18.585
HOWEVER AND INJURIES WITH A 24%

01:39:18.652 --> 01:39:20.287
INCREASE IN THE PER MILE

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:21.922
DEFINITELY. WHICH IS THE

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.657
HIGHEST EVER JUMP IN NINETY SIX

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.460
YEARS. BECAUSE WITH LESS CARS

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:29.063
ON THE ROAD PEOPLE DROVE FASTER

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.798
AND EVERY MILE AN HOUR FASTER

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:32.166
PEOPLE GO THE RATE OF INJURY

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:33.801
AND DEATH GOES UP ALMOST

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:37.037
EXPONENTIALLY. THIS IS ONE

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.272
PIECE OF THE TRAFFIC SAFETY

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.807
PUZZLE BUT A VERY VERY

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:42.343
IMPORTANT PIECE. WITH THAT I

THAT IS UNENFORCEABLE THAT'S

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:27.648
