DIRECTION IT HAS TAKEN BUT

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:27.117
THERE IS A THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.752
THIS LEGISLATION STILL REMAINS

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.421
AND WE FEEL IT IS IMPERATIVE

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.690
THAT WE- FIND RESOLUTION ON

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:34.458
THIS AND- THIS IS THE ONE THAT

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:35.392
THE AUTHOR HAS MADE A

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:37.161
SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT ON IT

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:39.730
WE'RE THANKFUL BUT- IS WHAT I

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.298
WILL CALL THAT DO NOT

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:42.600
IMPERSONATE POTS AND THE- FIRE.

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.803
ITSELF AS SUBDIVISIONS AND ENVY

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.672
OF SECTION THREE. I'M I WANT TO

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:49.173
BE CLEAR AGAIN THAT WE

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:49.707
ABSOLUTELY TAKE AUTHORED A

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:51.141
BIRD. THAT IT IS NOT HIS SCHOOL

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.343
TO SHUT DOWN CREDIT REPAIR

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:53.777
ORGANIZATIONS WE DON'T BELIEVE

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.913
THAT THAT'S AS INTENSE. BUT WE

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.747
DO BELIEVE THAT'S THAT FACT OF

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:57.948
THOSE TWO SUBDIVISIONS RIGHT

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.684

ARE. APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:07.024
ANALYSIS- INCORPORATE THAT

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.159
CONCEPT. OF A REQUIREMENT OF

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.762
THE DATA FURNITURE- AS TREE ANY

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.497
COMMUNICATION FROM A CSS SENT

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.999
ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER AS A

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.467
DIRECT COMMUNICATION FROM THE

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:18.202
CONSUMER THEMSELVES. WE THINK

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.371
IT'S CRUCIAL AND NOT COMING TO

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.972
A RESOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE IS

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.140
FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.576
IT'S THE WHOLE BALL GAME- STE.

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:28.479
THE FACT THAT CREDIT REPAIR

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:29.046
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACED WITH

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:32.449
THIS CHOICE. IT'S NOT IDEAL

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.817
IT'S NOT ANYONE'S IEA ALL IT'S

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.186

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.924
THIS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.557
AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT TO THE

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:43.827
CONSUMER. IT IGNORES THE FACT

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.429
THAT CSOS HAVE CONTRACTS WITH

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:46.563
THEIR CLIENTS IT'S JUST NOT

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.066
TRUE THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:49.600

BECAUSE OF ANY- ANTI CONSUMER

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.572
INTENT. I IT'S NOT NECESSARY

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:56.774
YES THEY DO THIS BECAUSE IF

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.776

THEIR LETTERS AND PUT IT TO THE

ONLY OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.861
A DISPUTE IS WHEN THEY GET A

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:33.904
WE'VE HEARD NOW TWICE- THERE IS

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:36.006
NO ALLEGATION IN THE LAWSUIT

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.674
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT RECEIVE THE

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.810
SERVICES THAT THEY CONTRACTED

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.645
FOR- THAT IS NOT A PART OF THE

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:44.348
LAWSUIT- THERE IS A BILLING

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.483
QUESTION THE CFPB HAS AN

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.285
INTERPRETATION OF LAW THE

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.554
DELAYS BILLING FOR SIX MONTHS

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:51.755
AND THE ALLEGATION IS THE

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.757
BILLING OCCURRED PRIOR TO SIX

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.359
MONTHS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.327
SERVICES- SOMETIMES THAT GETS

00:44:57.394 --> 00:45:00.097
CONFLATED WITH AN- UP FRONT FEE

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.598
THAT SUGGEST PRIOR TO THE

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.500
DELIVERY OF SERVICES. EXISTING

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.669
FEDERAL LAW AND CALIFORNIA LAW

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.171
REQUIRES THAT SERVICES BE

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.639
DELIVERED FIRST AND BILLING

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:11.508
OCCUR LATER- SO IT NEITHER OF

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.310
THOSE CHARACTERIZATIONS AS

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.612
ACCURATE. YEAH IF I MAY LIKE TO

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:16.980
PRIDE JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:21.452
ON. WHAT THE SERVICES ARE THAT

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.052
WOULD BE TO HELP MAKE IT. YES

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.354
JUST BRIEFLY. THIS COMMITTEE IN

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.690
PARTICULAR I THINK IS.

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:29.726
IMPORTANT COMMITTEE FOR THIS

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:32.529
MATTER- NOT BECAUSE OF THE

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:33.931
LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENT BUT

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:36.533
BECAUSE CREDIT. REPORTING IS

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.503
FUNDAMENTALLY A PRIVACY ISSUE.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.572
IT'S ABOUT OUR DATA IT'S ABOUT

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:43.607
THE WAY OUR DATA FLOWS BETWEEN

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:46.877
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND IT'S

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:47.478
ABOUT HOW THOSE BUSINESSES USE

00:45:47.544 --> 00:45:50.881
THAT DATA. FUNDAMENTALLY OUR

00:45:50.948 --> 00:45:53.750
WORK IS TO INSERT CONSUMERS

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.719
INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:58.322
THEM THAT OCCURS RELATIVE TO

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:02.326
THEIR DATA. AND SO AT ITS CORE

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:05.195
THE WORK THAT WE DO IS ABOUT

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.797
PRIVACY WHAT PEOPLE CAN SAY

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.899
ABOUT US AND HOW WE CAN

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.802
INTERVENE IN THAT MATTER WE

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.170
SPECIFICALLY FOCUS OUR

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.772
ATTENTION ON THE THREE CONSUMER

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.407
REPORTING AGENCIES THE

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.642
INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.377
THOSE CREDIT REPORTS. AND

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:23.514
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH TOOLS SO

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.549
THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:27.451
INFORMATION IS NOT ONLY

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:30.087
ACCURATE BUT THAT IT IS FAIR

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:32.089
AND THAT CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.690
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE HAVING

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:35.392
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT US AND

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.194
ABOUT OUR DATA. THEY BETTER

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:39.062
HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION TO

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.731
DEMONSTRATE WHY SOMETHING%

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.499
APPEARS ON A CREDIT REPORT AND

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:44.101
WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.369
THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE DO

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.137
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.206

NOT IMPERSONATE PROVISION AND

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:10.928
SO- YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT IN

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:13.864
LAST THE C. R. O. USES THE NAME

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:14.798

00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:51.935
THAT SOMEONE IS ACTING ON

LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD TIGHTEN

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.368

VERSION OF THE FEDERAL

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.087
REQUIREMENTS JUSTIN BUT THEIR

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.955

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:01.765
SAYING YOU HAVE A STATE VERSION

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:02.799
OF THAT REQUIREMENT THAT

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:05.502
EXTENDS TO SOMEONE ACTING AS AN

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:06.903
AGENT OF THE CONSUMER RIGHT. IN

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.004
WHICH THIS YEAR BECAUSE AGAIN

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.873
WE'RE- MISTER GREAT IN AS THE

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.110
AUTHOR CLEARLY. IS HAS

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:15.912
COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THIS

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:16.913
WITH THE VERY BEST PARTY TO

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.948
MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THAT. YOU

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:19.082
KNOW THIS AREA THEY DESCRIBE

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:21.318
DOESN'T HAPPEN I SAY IT IS NOT

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:25.322
OUR. GOAL TO MAKE TO HAVE.

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:28.658
HAPPENED SO. THIS OUT IN FOR

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:29.292
THE OPPOSITION OF ROBO LETTERS

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.093
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.594
ACTUALLY DO IS THERE A

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.228
LEGITIMATE PURPOSE OF THIS HOW

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.295
DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I THINK

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.164
I GOT A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.365
THERE I THINK THE SUBJECT OF

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:38.435
THIS WAS TO HELP THE CONSUMER

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:41.738
AND NOT TO. REDUCE THE WORKLOAD

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:43.273
AT THE DEBT COLLECTOR SO THAT'S

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.408
WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON. I

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.209
THINK THE NUMBER OF LETTERS IS

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:48.612
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:51.882
TO DISPUTE. SO BUT IT SEEMS TO

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:53.150
ME THAT THAT YOU'RE DISPUTING

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:53.950
WITHOUT THERE BEING A

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.620
REASONABLE BASIS TO BELIEVE

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:57.220
THAT IT MIGHT BE DISPUTABLE AS

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:59.356
THAT THE ALLEGATION FROM. JACK

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:00.223
LET ME CALIFORNIA ON THE

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.825
CLEARED FACT THE OLD THE

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:02.926
EXISTING LAW THAT YOU CAN

ADVISE YOUR CHARACTERIZATION.

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.630
YOU CAN ADVISE SUMER TO

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.465
DISPUTES. THOUGHT SOMETHING

THAT YOU OTHERWISE NO IS NO IS

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.769
VALID. ARMS SIMILARLY THERE IS

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.504
IT THERE ARE DEBTS OR CREDIT.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.773
THAT GETS PAID PAID OFF THAT

TROUBLING AND I THINK I MADE IT

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:12.429

AN APPROPRIATE BASIS UNDER THE

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:44.227
LAW IS SUBSTANTIATION. AND IT'S

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.897
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:50.066
CONSUMERS OFTEN HAVE NO SENSE

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:51.935
OF WHO A DEBT COLLECTOR IS WHAT

PRACTICE SEND EVERYTHING AS A

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:26.469
TEMPLATE THE ONLY THING THAT

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.938
CHANGES IS THE INFORMATION FROM

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:30.874

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.525
COURSE THERE'S THE BUREAUCRACY

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.727
AND THERE'S- THEY HAVE THEIR

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.896
OWN PROGRAMS AND STATES THAT I.

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:28.464

ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I DIDN'T

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.751
SEE ADDRESS WAS THE

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:50.753
CONFIDENTIALITY OF WHAT'S-

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.922
AGENCY USES THOSE- SOCIAL

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.624
SECURITY NUMBERS BECAUSE OF

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.758
COURSE AT THAT LIST WOULD BE A

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:58.828
GREAT LIST FOR- HACKERS TO HAVE

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:02.398
FOR A HE USED TO HAVE SO IT IS

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:02.932
YOUR INTENTION TO MAKE THE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:06.469
LIST. CONFIDENCE WE HAVEN'T-

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.237
BUT- IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEAS

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.672
AND- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.007

BILL FORD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:16.212
AT ITS IT WOULD BE AT NOT GREAT

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.880
IF THE- PRESS. PUTS OUT THERE

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.749
THAT THE- BUT WE ALREADY KNOW

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.952
EDT IS THE AGENCY THAT HAS SOME

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.787
OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES. AND IT

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.990
WOULD BE I THINK NOT

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.458
NECESSARILY BENEFICIAL TO HAVE

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.459
ALL THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.461
PUBLIC BUT I THINK THAT'S KNOWN

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.229
PHENOMENA AUDITOR ACTUALLY

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.498
SUBMITTED ITS PUBLIC- BUT

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:36.632
PROBABLY NO HE WE ALL YES THAT

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.068
THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN. MANY

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.003

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:43.606
EXCUSE IS ALWAYS. YOU KNOW THEY

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:44.374
THEY NEED TO DEVELOP THE

SOFTWARE AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.210
ANOTHER TEN YEAR SO- I THINK

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:48.277
IT'S GOOD TO PRESS ON THIS

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.580
ISSUE. I DO THINK THAT

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.015
COMPLIANCE FOR THIS IS GOING TO

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.684
BE. REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE NOT

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.886
TO SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT-

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:59.722
BUT- I MEAN I THINK WE

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.424
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.658
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU
