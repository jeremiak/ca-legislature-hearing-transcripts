WHERE THE HOLES WITH SI PC ON

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:14.350
THEIR OVERSIGHT OF VEGETATION

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:17.320
MANAGEMENT. YES I THINK THAT I

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:19.689
AM THE PLACE IT IS BEEN MOST

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:21.591
ILLUSTRATED BEYOND OBVIOUSLY

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.226
THE FIRES DEATH AND DESTRUCTION

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.328
THAT I TALK ABOUT OPENING WHAT

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.363
IS THROUGH JUDGE ALSUP'S OWN

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.532
OVERSIGHT OF AND P. JEANNIE

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:32.034
SPECIFICALLY AND THE COURT

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.636
ORDERED MONITORING THAT CASE IS

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.671
GONE OUT AND SPOT CHECKED. THIS

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:36.906
WORKED OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.774
THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LINES SO

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.576
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO IT

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.979
IS HARD FOR ANY ONE ENTITY TO

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.013
UNLESS WITHOUT MASSIVE

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.514
RESOURCES DO THE PROPER

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:46.882
OVERSIGHT AND SO PART OF WHAT

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:48.751
WE'RE DOING HERE IS ENSURING

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:50.052
THAT THEIR LOCAL INSPECTORS

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.487
THIRTIES OFFICE WHO CAN DO THAT

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.989
AND I WANT TO POINT OUT. AND

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.357
HOPEFULLY THIS ALSO DRESSES MRS

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.791
FRIEDMAN'S COMMENTS BUT ALSO

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:56.692
SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:58.160
OPPOSITION THE ONE OF THE

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.296
AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING TODAY-

DOES PROVIDE A RIGHT TO CURE

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:02.865
AND INSTRUCTS THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.667
FIGURE OUT WHAT A REASONABLE

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.269
PATHWAY TO RATE TO CURIOUS

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.370
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT COULD BE

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:08.904
A DIFFERENT TIMELINE.

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:12.541
POTENTIALLY NEED TO GET PERMITS.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:13.843
AND THAT TAKES TIME- BUT AT THE

RIGHT TO CURE WAS DONE BECAUSE

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.746
THE GOAL HERE IS PREVENTION.

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.114
AND SO WHAT WE WANT IS LOCAL

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.949
INSPECTORS TO COME IN AND SAY

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.183

IT THER ARE NO FINES AND

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:42.538
THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.473
IS THE GOAL. AND WE BELIEVE

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.608
THAT THAT SHOULD BE WHAT'S

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:46.742

RIGHT TO GO AND FIX ESPECIALLY

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:22.578

TO THAT ISSUE IS- THIS IS A

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.625

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:42.365
DISCRETIONARY EXERCISE IN THE

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.567
RIDING OF DIFFERENT- CONTACTS

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:47.703
IF IT IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:48.871
THE MINISTRY TO REGISTER

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.073
REASONS FOR A UTILITY TO CLEAR

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.409
VEGETATION FROM A DISTRIBUTION

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.478
OR POWER LINES THEN THAT'S NOT

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:56.512
THE CASE THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.847
IT UP LIKE IF IT HAS ANY TEETH

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.349
THAT ARE AS ANY MERIT- BUT

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.550
WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.786
NOT DONE. THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.488
WE WOULD- CONCEIVABLY TAKE

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:07.256
ACTION PARTICULAR WORK RESULT

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.859
IN A SUBSTANTIAL- WILDFIRE THE

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:11.193
STATUE HAS BUILT INTO IT A

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.395
NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR A JUDGE

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.130
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.765
I'M SURE THAT THE AN ABILITY TO

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:20.136
CORRECT THE PROBLEM IF THAT.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.170

DISCRETION AS DESCRIBED THERE

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.479
IS ACTUALLY LANGUAGE IN THE

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.081
BILL. IT SAYS THAT THE COURT IS

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:32.648
SUPPOSED TO TAKE INTO

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.816
CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.819
A PENALTY- WHETHER. THE

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.587

WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS IN

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.453
HAVING THEM REVIEWED BY THE CAN

OF THAT BECAUSE SOME DA HAS A

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.507
REALLY NEAT IDEA THEY'RE GOING

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:33.108
TO THROW A BRAND NEW PROCESS

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:36.011
INTO THAT WHOLE MIX. IT DOESN'T

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.913

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.064
ALL WORKED VERY VERY HARD ON

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.600
SETTING UP THE PROCESS THAT WE

01:08:57.666 --> 01:09:02.271
NOW HAVE- FRANKLY YEARS TO IRON

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:07.510
THAT OUT AND EACH. WHEN WE HEAR

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.111
ABOUT THINGS AND I UNDERSTAND

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.179
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:13.048
UNDERSTAND NO. ALL POLITICS ARE

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:17.653
LOCAL. BOY FOR THESE COMPANIES

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.988
FOR THESE WORKERS TO GET INTO

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.790
SOME OF THESE AREAS THEY HAVE

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.260
TO GET THOSE COUNTY PERMITS.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:27.162
AND MY CONCERN WITH HOW THIS

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.831
BILL HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE D.

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:31.800
A.'S IN NOT TO SAY THERE'S

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.236
VALENTYN HERE BUT THE COUNTY

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.504
CAN LITERALLY HOLD BACK A

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:38.541
PERMIT AND HAVE THE DIEGO WHEN

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:42.778
INSTRUCTOR PROSECUTE PROCESS.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.345
HE IN IT TURNS INTO A MONEY

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.715
SCHEME. FOR THE COUNT. BECAUSE

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.517
THEY CAN BLOCK THE PERMIT AND

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:49.418
THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE GOING TO

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.654
DO THIS AND THAT IS MY CONCERN

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.855
WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.758
ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT WE

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.893
ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS THAT

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.295
THAT IS NOW STARTING TO BE

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.097
IMPLEMENTED PLUS THE SIGHTING

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:03.766
OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT GOING

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:04.934
IN AND LOOKING AT IT AND IN ALL

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.835
THE BAD BLOOD THAT'S HAPPENED

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.338
OVER THE YEARS. WITH NOT GOING

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.040
IN AND NOT CLEANING UP AND ALL

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:12.908
OF THAT THAT IS. PART OF THE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.411
OLD SYSTEM THAT WE WORK SO

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.713
HARD. THROUGH THE SENATE BILLS

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.582
TO GET RID OF IT NOW WE HAVE A

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.483
NEW SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD. I

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.886
THINK WOULD BE WRONG OF US AS A

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.888
LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO SEE YOU

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.156
KNOW WHAT WE WORKED REALLY HARD

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.358
ON A PROCESS. WE'RE NOT EVEN

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.126
GOING TO GIVE IT A CHANCE. TO

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:34.063
WORK. AND FOR THAT I CAN'T

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.764
SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I WE'VE

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.699
GOT TO SEE THIS PROCESS WE

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:38.500
WORKED ON. ACTUALLY TAKE ROOT

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.670
AND WORK. SO THE TIMING OF THIS

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:45.708
I DON'T THINK IS NECESSARY- NO

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.710
I RESPECT YOUR YOUR HEART

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:49.478
TOGETHER SOLVE TO THIS THE

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:50.946
WILDFIRES ARE ARE AN ISSUE THE

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.948
AIR QUALITY IS AN ISSUE AND

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.216
THESE ARE THINGS THAT MUST BE

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:57.586
ADDRESSED BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:58.787
TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.189
THE PROCESS THAT WE ALREADY

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:03.926
WORKED SO HARD ON IN NATURE

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.894
THAT THAT WORKS IN IN IS MOVING.

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.863
IN AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY. TO

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.465
ENSURE WE'RE KNOCKING WILDFIRES

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.433
IN DOING THAT DOING SOMETHING

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:11.900
THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:15.004
REPETITIVE FEES. TO ME WHEN I

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.671
LOOK AT IT AT THE AT THE END OF

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.172
THE DAY. COME FROM ONE OF THE

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.841
POOREST DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.476
I HAVE TO LOOK IS THIS GOING TO

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.311
POSSIBLY DRIVE UP THE COST OF

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.380
PEOPLE'S ENERGY BILLS OR IS IT

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.715
GOING TO LOWER IT. IN THE ONE

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.083
OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.051
IN THE STATE IS THE COST OF

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.854
LIVING. IN IF WE'RE INCREASING

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.689
THE COST IN ANY WAY EVEN IF

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.924
THAT'S NOT THE INTENT. THEN

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:38.027
THERE'S- WE SHOULD BE DOING. IN

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.728
AND FOR THAT I'M NOT GOING TO

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.364
SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:21.203
THERE'S A JUDGE'S SAYS WELL ONE

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.438
OF THESE RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.406
SOME OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:27.676
MY EXPERIENCE BOTH AS A CITY

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:28.377
LEADER AND ALSO IN THE FIRE

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:31.280
SERVICE. ARE THINGS THAT ARE

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.482
WAY BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:34.550
THAT'S THE REGULATORY

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:35.617
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.920
CREATED IN THE STATE IN REGARDS

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.589
TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. OVER THE

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:43.058
PAST TWENTY YEARS THAT CREATE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.094
HURDLES IN IN IMPEDIMENTS TO

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.863
ACTUALLY GETTING- TO ADDRESSING

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.998
THE VEGETATION ISSUE AND THE

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.267
VEGETATION ISSUE IS. THE ONE

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.869
THING THAT WE HAVE SOME CONTROL

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:57.139
OVER. AS A CITY WE ARE UNABLE

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.841
TO GET PERMITS TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.176
CLEAR AWAY BRUSH AND IT ALMOST

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:01.744
COST AS A NEIGHBORHOOD LAST

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.314
YEAR. THAT PROCESS IS SO LONG.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.917
THAT OUR IS SO ONEROUS. THAT WE

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:11.887
CAN'T WE CAN'T GO IN AND START

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:14.223
FINING PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:14.823
ABLE TO GET THROUGH A PROCESS

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.126
THAT WE CREATED. I THINK MY

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:20.095
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY-

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:20.896
MENTIONED THE INCENTIVE TO

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.098
FIND. WHEN YOU CREATE A PROGRAM

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.867
THAT DEPENDS ON FINDS PEOPLE

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.802
GONNA WANNA GO OUT AND FINE. SO

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.438
THEY CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN HAVE

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:33.142
THEIR PROGRAM- THE COSTS. ARE

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.810
GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.946
CUSTOMERS I REALIZED THAT. THAT

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.581
THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THERE THAT

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.049
SAYS HERE NOT THEY CAN'T PASS

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.519
ALONG TO CUSTOMERS. BUT IF YOUR

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.054
CHOICE IS GOING BROKE OR GOING

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.090
PASSING ALONG I MEAN THAT'S

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.291
BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO PASS

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.226
ALONG TO CUSTOMERS THIS YEAR

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.795
WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT A 20%

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:53.796
INCREASE IN OUR ELECTRICAL

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.064
RATES AND A LOT OF IT IS

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:57.766
RELATED TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.835
THE STATE WITH THAT. THE

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.236
REGULATIONS AND HOW THEY'RE

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:06.074
BEING- FIND IN IN IN THE COST

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.676
TO THOSE THOSE THOSE ENTITIES

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.745
WE NEED TO PAVE THE WAY FOR

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.647
THEM TO DO THEIR JOB SO THAT

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.282
THEY WILL DO THEIR JOB THERE'S

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:16.018
NOBODY IN THE UTILITY SPACE.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:19.221
THAT ONCE WILD FIRES TO

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.222
CONTINUE. THEY WANT TO DO THEIR

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.158
JOB. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO DO

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.560
THEIR JOB WE'VE CREATED

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:26.161
REGULATIONS IN LAST FEW YEARS

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.363
THAT MAY HELP THEM BUT LIKE MY

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.165
COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING WE NEED TO

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.067
GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO DO THAT

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:36.738
SO FOR NOW. AT THE END I'M NOT

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:37.773
GOING TO BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.809
THIS- JUST FOR THOSE REASONS

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:41.810
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.413
YOU. TO CREATE THE SOLUTIONS

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.582
THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.750
HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE TO DOING

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.352
THIS SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:52.688
IT AND- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.557
YOUR PASSION ON THE ISSUE. YEAH

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.861
MR STONE. THANK YOU ONE

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.696
CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE WITH THIS

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.631
BILL THOUGH I'M A CO AUTHOR

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.832
BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO DO

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.033
SOMETHING WE NEED TO SOMETHING

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.502
DRAMATIC HERE IS THIS OVER

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.271
RELIANCE ON VEGETATION

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:09.905
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:13.041
DODGE BY SOME OF THE I. O. USE

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.544
FOR YEARS TO NOT UPGRADE THEIR

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.179
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACTUALLY MAKE

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:18.914
IT SAFE BECAUSE THINGS ARE

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:21.083
GOING TO HAPPEN. IN THE FORESTS

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.885
AND THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.653
ALONG THE LINES THAT THAT WILL

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.121
LEAD TO FIRES AND IF THEY'RE

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.357
NO USING AND UPGRADING THEIR

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:29.358
SYSTEMS TO THE NEWEST

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.927
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL CONTINUE

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:34.696
REGARDLESS OF THE THIS OVER

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:35.898
RELIANCE ON VEGETATION

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:38.233
MANAGEMENT SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.434
JUST ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HERE.

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.503
BUT AS TO THE REST OF IT I WILL

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.339
HAVE TO SAY. THAT HAVING BEEN

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.541
ENGAGED IN THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.543
WITH OUR LOCAL I. O. U. TWO

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.780
GREAT FRUSTRATION LOCALLY. AND

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.382
WITH WITH REALLY ALL OF THE

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:55.884
AGENCIES. I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.786
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS GOING TO

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.655
ADDRESS UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.290
DONE UP THIS POINT IS ACTUALLY

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:02.824
GONNA DRESS ANY THESE ISSUES.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.559
BECAUSE AT LEAST THE I. O. U.

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:07.195
IN MY AREA. IS NOT PAYING

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:09.898
ATTENTION. THEY HAVE LONG HAD

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.033
EASY ACCESS TO PROPERTIES

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.434
BECAUSE OF RIGHTS OF WAY THEY

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.469
GET UNDER THOSE PROPERTIES. AND

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.605
THEY HAVE LONG. CUT MAJOR

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.807
SWATHS EVEN OVER THE OBJECTIONS

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.575
OF LANDED REASONABLE OBJECTIONS

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:22.911
OF LANDOWNERS. LOCAL FIRE

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:25.080
CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS. SERVE

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.249
WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT THE

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.751
SITUATION IS. THERE THE IN THE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.653
CZ YOU FIRE IT THE RESPONSE HAS

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.289
REALLY BAD VISIBLE THEY CLAIM

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.124
THEIR CHALLENGES ARE RIGHTS OF

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:40.562
ACCESS. WELL CALIFORNIA- YES

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:43.031
FEMA THE COUNTY HAD NO PROBLEM

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.299
GETTING RIGHTS OF ACCESS AND

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.001
BUILT THOSE AGREEMENTS WHERE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.869
WAS THE LOCAL I. O. U. NOT TO

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:50.672
BE SEEN. THEY'RE STILL HAVING

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:51.306
NO PROBLEM GOING ON TO PEOPLE'S

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:53.809
PROPERTY. LEAVING MATERIALS

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.777
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE LEAVING.

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:57.846
AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA COASTAL

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.148
COMMISSION IN THE COUNTY HAVE

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.717
HAVE ISSUED NOTICES OF

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.386
VIOLATION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.555
AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE BAD

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.690
ACTIVITY AND A BAD ACTOR. THAT

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.292
THE AYE YOU YOU IS BEING.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.294
THEY'RE BRINGING IN THEIR THEIR

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.462
UNDER THE NEW RULES THEY'RE

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:14.796
SUPPOSED TO BRING IN FORSTER'S

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.665
WELL THEY BRING FORESTERS FROM

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.701
TEXAS IN NEW JERSEY AND ALL

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:21.603
INTO A REDWOOD FOREST. NOW NO

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.071
OFFENSE CITIES FORSTER'S BUT

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:26.208
THEY DON'T OPERATE IN REDWOOD

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.976
FORESTS SO ARE THEY MAKING.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:29.411
APPROPRIATE DECISIONS YES IT'S

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.314
AN ARBORIST. YES IT'S SOME

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:34.249
POTENTIALLY FORRESTER BUT

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:34.950
SOMEBODY DOESN'T REALLY

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:37.085
UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF WHAT

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:39.454
THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND HOW

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:41.656
THOSE SYSTEMS FUNCTION. AND BY

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.091
THE WAY THE FIRES TO BURN

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.493
THROUGH BIG BASS AND OTHER

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.495
PLACES BURNED IN WAYS THAT THE

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:46.995
FORCE OF REALLY DID NOT

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.398
UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.799
EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.667
DAY DEHYDRATION THE FOREST AND

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.936
OTHER IMPACTS SO THOSE FORCED

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.339
TO CHANGING. EVEN WITH RESPECT

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:58.840
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS HOW

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:02.711
THOSE FOR CEMENT. SO PGNIG IS

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:05.047
KIND OF CHECKING BOXES. BUT NOT

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.982
BEING EFFECTIVE IN HOW THEY'RE

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:10.152
MANAGING. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.454
WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC SAFETY

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.589
AND HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:16.625
THEIR RESPONSE TO THE FORCE IN

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:18.093
INTO THE FOUR STARS IT'S REALLY

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.895
BEEN A VISIBLE THERE ARE STILL

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.163
A NUMBER OF NOTICES OF

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.365
VIOLATION OUT TO THEM THAT

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.634
THEY'RE REFUSING TO DEAL. SO IF

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.036
WE'RE GIVING SOME AUTHORITY TO

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:30.806
LOCAL PROSECUTORS TO GO AFTER

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.408
BAD ACTORS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:34.943
PROBLEM WITH THAT SOMETHING'S

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.711
GOING TO HAVE TO WAKE UP. THE

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:40.148
UTILITIES. TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:43.218
THEIR SYSTEMS A LOT BETTER ENDS

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:45.387
IF WE'RE GOING TO. BEMOAN THE

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.688
FACT IT RATES ARE GOING UP

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.989
BECAUSE THE DECISIONS ARE BEING

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.157
MADE YEAH WE SHOULD BE VERY

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.093
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:53.161
SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE AND

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.764
UTILITY BOTTOM LINE. IS

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.732
SOMETHING THAT IS DRIVING UP.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:58.667
SOME OF THE COSTS TO THE

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:01.303
SHAREHOLDERS AND WHAT THAT

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.605
REALLY MEANS IS. THE SHOULD BE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.942
IN THIS AWFUL. ORGANIZATIONS

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:09.344
AND NOT PRIVATELY OWNED BECAUSE

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.346
THEN THOSE COSTS IN THOSE

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.381
DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:15.283
FOR SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.152
APART MINDS WOULD BE OFF THE

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.421
TABLE THAT BY DEFINITION WOULD

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.456
BE CHEAPER FOR RATEPAYERS

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.658
ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND GIVE US

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:26.394
MORE DIRECT ABILITY TO MANAGE

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:28.130
THESE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.432
SO THE VALUES THEMSELVES ARE

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.466
SAYING WHEN THEY'RE TALKING

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:34.136
ABOUT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.837
THEY'RE MAKING THE CASE TO NOT

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:39.808
HAVE UTILITIES BEING RUN BY

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.743
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SAID

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.777
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ON

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.746
THE TABLE AS WE WERE TRYING TO

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.615
ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.482
WITH WILDFIRES AND

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.950
UNFORTUNATELY WAS TAKEN OFF BUT

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.685
THAT IS A REAL SOLUTION THAT

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:52.287
CALIFORNIA FOR BEING ABLE TO

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:54.256
MANAGE ITS GREAT LONG TERM. AND

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.825
KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE HAVE TO

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.161
BE WILLING TO TAKE STEPS LIKE

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.896
THAT TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:03.131
RIGHT. ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:05.200
LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY ARE

I THINK THERE NEEDS TO STILL BE

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.074
A LOT MORE DONE TO RAINY AND SO

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.076
VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. IN

IF YOU LOOK AT ON THE GROUND

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:23.051
RIGHT NOW. HOW THESE I'LL USER

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.886

WE'VE GOT A MOTION. NOTICE AND

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.430
CLOSING- IN IN RESPONSE TO MY

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.799
COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE LIKE I

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:38.934
THINK THAT THERE IS. THERE'S

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.036
THREE THINGS A SUSTAINED FIRE.

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:43.205
IT OXYGEN. THE TECHNICIAN IN

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:45.840
ITS FUEL. WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.442
TODAY ABOUT HIS IGNITION AND

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:47.976
WHO IS MAY OR MAY NOT BE

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.312
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT BUT ONCE

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:50.912
THAT ONCE THAT IGNITION IS ON

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:53.148
THE GROUND. I THINK IT CANNOT

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.449
BE UNDERSTATED HOW IMPORTANT

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.984
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THIS AT

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.886
THAT POINT. BECAUSE AND THAT'S

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.154
THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY THAT

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.121
LOCAL PROPERTY OWNERS

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.823
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE ONCE

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.326
THAT SPARK HITS THE- GROUND.

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.160
IT'S OFF TO THE RACES AND I

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.962
THINK THAT'S- WHERE WE NEED TO

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.029
UNDERSTAND THAT WE AS A STATE

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.065
WE AS A- AS A BODY HAVE THAT

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:11.733
RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL IS TO

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.868
MAKE SURE. THAT ONCE THAT

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:14.369
IGNITION NO MATTER WHO'S

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:16.171
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. WHETHER

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:18.206
IT'S LIGHTNING OR MAN MADE.

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.341
ONES THAT SPARK HITS THE

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.643
GROUND. WE GOT TO GET THE MEN

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:22.244
AND WOMEN IN THE FIRE SERVICE

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.912
THE OPPORTUNITY. AND THE

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.347
ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB AND

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:26.481
CATCH UP TO THEM SO I DO THINK

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.282
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.984
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WELL. BUT

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.552
THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:31.453
BECAUSE THE VEGETATION

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.821
MANAGEMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:34.789
IS HOW WE MANAGE THE FORESTS

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.258
WHAT WE ARE IN FACT TALKING

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.892
ABOUT HERE WITH THIS MESS THIS

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.095
VERY. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.663
QUESTION. IS THAT IGNITION

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.465
CORRECT AND SO IF THERE WHICH

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.634
IS WHY THEY THEY CUT LARGE

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.769
SWATHS UNDERNEATH THEIR- THEIR

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.472
LINES. A. N. BUT REFUSED TO

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:51.606
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LINES ARE

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.308
USING APPROPRIATE MODERN

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.976
TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.578
THAT'S PARKING DOESN'T HAPPEN.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.014
AND SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.149
CLEARING BACK APPROPRIATELY NOT

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.384
INAPPROPRIATELY WHICH IS WHAT

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:04.419
THEY TENDED. BUT CLING BACK

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.820
APPROPRIATELY BUT BUT REALLY

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:07.622
WHAT IT IS MAKING INVESTMENTS.

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.524
AND GROUND FAULT INTERRUPTERS

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:10.725
IN FAST SWITCHES AND THINGS

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:14.396
THAT THAT. WILL DE ENERGIZE THE

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:14.963
LINE. BEFORE IT'S GOING TO.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.531
THAT SPARKED IT WHAT YOU'RE

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.432
ABOUT WITH THE VEGETATION

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:18.533
MANAGEMENT THE FORESTRY

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.435
MANAGEMENT TO MINIMIZE THE

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:21.836
IMPACT OF FIRES IS REALLY

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.638
BEYOND THE QUESTION HERE.

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:24.306
BECAUSE THAT'S A BIGGER

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.840
QUESTION THAT THAT THE I'LL USE

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:27.509
ARE NOT GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.143
FOR BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.744
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING. THE

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.479
ENTIRE FOREST AND HOW THAT FIRE

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.014
THAT MOVES THROUGH THE FOREST.

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.749
WE ARE TALKING SPECIFICALLY

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.484
ABOUT THE POINT OF IGNITION AND

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.953
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. FOR

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.122
MANAGING THAT INTERACTION

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:43.558
BETWEEN AND ENERGIZED LINE

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.926
WHICH SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DE

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.628
ENERGIZE MORE QUICKLY WORKS.

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.630
NOT HAVE THAT SPARK BECAUSE OF

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:51.733
THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.300
INSULATION BECAUSE OF OTHER

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:53.601
THINGS. SO NOT HAVING THAT

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:55.570
IGNITION IN IT BEYOND THAT.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.172
THAT'S REALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.006
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.407
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS ON WHICH

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:04.045
STATION AFTER. OF COURSE FIRST

COUNTY HAS NOT APPROVED THE

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:31.706
PERMIT. SO IF THE I DON'T SEE

BEAT UP BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.056
SIGN OFF ON A PERMIT TO LET ME.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.958
SO I DON'T WANNA I WANNA MAKE

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.960
SURE THIS DOESN'T TURN INTO A

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.428
PREDATORY PROCESS YEAH COUNTY

WAY MISTER MATHIS ARE TRUSTED

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:09.177
HERE- AND I MAY NOT BE THE ONLY

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.412
THING RIGHT PERMITS IS ONLY ONE

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:11.246
THING YOU MISTER FLOOR

MENTIONED OTHER BARRIERS-

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:15.450
MISTER SARATOGA AS WELL- AND

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.051
YES SO IT IS SPECIFICALLY

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.153
ADDRESSED IN THE COURTS

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.621
ANALYSIS OF FINES AND FEES SO

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:23.124
IF THE DA WERE TO BRING ACTION.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:26.227
THAT- WAS FOR LACK OF EDUCATION

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:26.995
MANAGEMENT SUMMIT COULD

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.096
MITIGATE THE COURT IS

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:30.298
INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THAT INTO

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:30.865
CONSIDERATION WHEN DECIDING

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.834
WHETHER TO FIND. ENEMY HELPER

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.769
THAT'S THE BASIC DEFENSE TO

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:36.171
ISSUE BEING BROUGHT UNDER

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.173
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BY A DA IS

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.741
IF THERE'S A MINISTERIAL OR IF

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.810
THERE'S A GOVERNMENTAL ACTION.

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:44.012
THAT THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:47.816
WOULD HAVE NEEDED. IN ORDER TO

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.951
MOVE FORWARD THEN. THERE'S NO

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.519
CASE YET MATHIS SALAS THAT'S

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:52.654
UNDERSTANDABLE IT'S JUST

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.590
INSURING EVEN THE PROCESS OF

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.292
THAT IS GOING TO COST THE

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.894
UTILITY MORE MONEY. SO IT IT'S

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.930
MAKING SURE IT'S VERY STAUNCH

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.832
AND CLEAR THAT WE HAD D. A.

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:06.534
CAN'T JUST BE LIKE WELL LET'S

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:09.037
JUST DO THIS ANYWAY. WELL I

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:09.671
WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE THINGS

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:10.572
ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR MOVING

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:12.240
FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:14.409
JUDICIARY. AND A LOT OF THE

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:15.577
CONCERNS ARE ON THE JUDICIARY

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:19.247
SIDE AND I BELIEVE MR SONG

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:19.781
YOU'RE STILL ON JUDICIARY

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:24.519
CORRECT SO. YEAH AND I DO I

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:25.820
MEAN WHAT I AS I READ THE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.888
LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:27.956
BUT IF IT'S NOT WE'RE HAPPY

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.357
CLEAR THAT THE INTENT OF THIS

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.159
BILL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.329
WAS IS NOT A GOTCHA IT'S NOT

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.130
EXCESSIVE FINES IT IS VERY MUCH

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:39.334
GIVING THE UTILITIES. THE

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.469
OPPORTUNITY TO CURE LETTING

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.370
THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.272
VIOLATION. ASKING THEM TO FIX

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.373
IT GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.841
TO FIX IT FOR ANY ACTION BE CAN

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.510
BE TAKEN WHICH AGAIN. IN MY

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.811
CONVERSATIONS WITH EDISON THEY

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.679
SAID THEY DO SO WE SHOULD HAVE

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:55.316
NO PROBLEMS- BUT- ENSURING THAT

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:57.652
IF THEY DON'T. WE HAVE THE

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:59.721

HIS COMMENTS AND I KNOW BOTH.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:09.797
YOU KNOW WE'VE SEVERAL PEOPLE

PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS AND-

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.571
OBVIOUSLY IS CRITICAL FOR ALL

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:17.639
OF US THAT WE GET THIS WORK

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.440

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.209
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.410
THE DEVASTATION THAT OCCURS

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.579
WHEN A FIRE HAPPENS- AS TO YOUR

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:27.415
COMMENT MISTER MATHIS- ABOUT

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:29.918
REPAIR COSTS I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.720
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT AND-

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:33.955
MISTER WHICH MENTIONS THE-

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.890
ENORMOUS FINES THAT COME OUT OF

THESE FIRES THAT IN FACT. THIS

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.227
OPPORTUNITY TO CURE AND HAVE

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.228
PEOPLE PROVIDING THAT

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:42.096
OPPORTUNITY. COULD SAVE THE I

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.665
USE MONEY IF THEY DO THE WORK

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.233

IN THEIR WORK ON THAT. THIS

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.006
COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THE COST

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.007
ON THE I USE RATHER THAN

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:54.175

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.581
THE MAJOR COLLAPSES WHICH

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:16.383
THREATEN LIVES AND PROPERTY

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.617

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.256
THIS BILL WE WOULD AIM TO GAIN

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:24.357
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:26.426
PROCESSES LEADING UP THE CLIFF

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:28.628
FAILURES BY DOING TWO THINGS

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:29.829
FIRST WE WILL ACCELERATE THE

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.631
COLLECTION OF THE SLIDER DATA

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:33.133
ALLOWING MORE FREQUENT AND

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.668
HIGHER RESOLUTION SCANS OF THE

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.703
CLIFFS. AND ASSIMILATE THESE

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.271
MEASUREMENTS INTO A GROWING

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:39.773
HISTORICAL DATA BASE TO LEARN

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:41.675
WHERE AND WHEN FAILURES HAVE

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:43.843
OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND WHERE

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.612
THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:48.114
IN THE FUTURE. A KEY GOAL IS TO

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:49.549
FIND OUT OF ANY SIGNATURE

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:51.217
EXISTS THAT COULD FORETELL OF

01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:52.485
HEIGHTENED RISK IN SPECIFIC

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:55.822
LOCATIONS. SECONDLY WE WOULDN'T

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:00.293
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED HERE AT

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.096
SCRIPTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:05.765
THAT CAN DETECT INFINITESIMAL

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:07.667
DEFORMATIONS OF THE ROCKS.

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.436
AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:11.071
THE FORMATIONS ARE IMPACTED BY

01:50:11.137 --> 01:50:13.239
TIDES LARGE SURFACE GROUNDWATER

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:15.575
AND RAINFALL. TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.177
ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.679
SIGNALS EXIST THAT CAN FORECAST

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:22.949
WHERE AND WHEN. AN INCREASE

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.451
RISK FOR COLLAPSE IS DEVELOPING.

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:27.253
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.575
MOVEMENTS CLIFF RETREAT STORM

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:51.011
SURGE AND MORE FOR DECADES AND

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:51.945

PRIMARY STUDY SITE FOR SCRIPTS

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:54.914
WHICH WERE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.883
RIGHT NEXT DOOR. WE HAVE A

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.885
STATE OF THE ART C. LEVEL RISE

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:00.286

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.392
ABOUT LONG TERM TRENDS

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:06.993
INCLUDING CLIFFORD TREAT AND

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.828
WHAT CAN MAKE THEM COLLAPSE

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.330
WELL WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW TO

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:12.065
IDENTIFY AREAS LIKELY TO COME

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:14.567
DOWN NOW WE CAN'T TELL YOU IS

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.269
IT SAFE TO LAY MY TOWEL ON THE

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:18.471
BEACH IN THIS LOCATION. THIS IS

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:20.607
A HUGE ISSUE FOR LOCAL CITIES

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:22.675
WE'VE HAD DEATHS AS MENTIONED

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:24.244
IN THE CADIA DELMAR TORREY

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.879
PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:27.847
UNEXPECTED FROM CLIFFS FAILURES

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.582
THAT WERE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.284
PROTECTED WE HAVE A RAILROAD AT

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.853
RISK IN DEL MAR- IN IS- THE

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.655
AUTHORS MENTIONED WITH SERVICE

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.023
WAS STOPPED JUST A COUPLE WEEKS

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:39.025
AGO WHEN A MAJOR UNEXPECTED

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:41.661
COLLAPSE OCCURRED. HAND SOLVED

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:43.563
COASTAL ACT AND CHIEF EXISTING

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.465
GENERAL PLANT LAW REQUIRES THAT

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:46.833
CITIES LIKE DEL MAR THAT WE ALL

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.802
STUDY AND PREPARE AND THAT-

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:51.371
HAZARD ANALYSIS BUT THERE'S

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.939
NOTHING IN THE LAW AND THERE'S

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:54.407
NOTHING IN THE RESEARCH

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:55.575
REPERTOIRE TO HELP THE CITY

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:58.111
IDENTIFY WHAT'S AT RISK AND HOW

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.846
TO DEAL WITH THAT THAT'S WHY

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:02.015
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT AB SIXTY

THIS IS A SIMPLE. WAY THAT WE

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:20.025
CAN DO THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE IT'S

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:22.961
ABOUT HOW WE CONSUME HOW WE ACT

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:24.462
TOWARDS OUR ENVIRONMENT AND

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.197
MAKE IT EASIER- I DO WANT TO

02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:31.302

THAT CAME UP WAS THE 1% SAVINGS

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:45.116
SO IF A RESTAURANT A SMALL

02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:46.885
RESTAURANT CAN SAVE ONE

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:48.887
PERCENT. IN THE BOTTOM LINE

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:50.321
WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING

02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:52.190

REINVEST IN THE RESTAURANT IT'S

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:58.897

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:00.031
WASTE THEIR MONEY ON SOMETHING

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:01.700
THAT'S GOING TO GO IN TE TRASH

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:04.903

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:23.946
THIS BILL. IT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:25.381
APPROACH IN ESTABLISHING A GOAL

02:55:25.448 --> 02:55:26.716
IT'S DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:28.251
THE ONLY THING THAT THIS BILL

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:29.685

YEARS THERE'S STILL. A

03:37:30.303 --> 03:37:33.573
RELATIVELY LOW CHANCE THAT AN

COME UP AS A ONE OF THE REASONS

04:00:06.425 --> 04:00:07.726
AND ONE OF THE BARRIERS WAS NOT
