SEPTEMBER- AND THIS YEAR THERE

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.016
IS EIGHTEEN PROJECTS THAT OLD

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.285
FAMILIAR WAS LISTED. IN OUR

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.187
FEBRUARY HAVE PRELIMINARY

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:04.924
APPROVAL LETTER. AND THE LARGE

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.860
MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE SEISMIC

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.562
INNATE. AND THIS IS A PROCESS

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.032
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED- IN TWO

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.666
THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WITH

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.268
AB NINETY FOUR WHICH ALLOWS YOU

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.438
SEE TO USE A UP WITH THEIR

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.040
SUPPORT APPROPRIATION IN ORDER

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.142
TO SELL BONDS ARE PAID PAID

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.377
THAT SERVICE ON BONDS TO FUND

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.080
THESE PROJECTS. AS LONG AS IT

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.415
DOESN'T EXCEED MORE THAN 15% OF

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:34.621
THEIR NET SUPPORT BUT. SO FOR

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.855
REFERENCE IT MIGHT HELP TO GO

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.624
TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA THAT

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.158
LISTS ALL OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.094
PROJECTS- IN THIS ITEM UP FOR

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.297
CONSIDERATION. I'M AS THE

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.566
MINISTRATION NOTED- AND YOU CAN

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.635
SEE IN THE FIGURE MOST OF. THE

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.537
PROJECTS ADDRESS CRITICAL LIFE

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.239
SAFETY SEISMIC PROJECTS. I'M IN

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.107
THERE A FEW OTHER PROJECTS IN

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.475
ADDITION TO THAT- THE-

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.710
UNIVERSITY'S OVERALL APPROACH

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.078
OF EMPHASIZING SEISMIC LIFE

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.246
SAFETY PROJECT SEEMS REASONABLE

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.047
TO US WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNED

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.815
WITH THAT OVERALL APPROACH. WE

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.618
DO HAVE- THREE SPECIFIC

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.619
CONCERNS AT ALL WALK THROUGH

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.822
QUICKLY. ALL THE FIRST RELATES

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.058
TO ALL THE PROPOSALS IN THIS

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:12.725
FIGURE AND THAT IS THAT THE

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.594
UNIVERSITY- IS GENERALLY

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.796
REQUESTING A PRE AUTHORIZATION

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.965
OF ALL OF THE PHASES OF. BOTH

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.733
THE PLANNING PHASES AND

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.268
CONSTRUCTION THIS IS SOMETHING

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.336
THE UNIVERSITY REGULARLY

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.438
REQUESTS FOR AND IN PREVIOUS

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:26.573
YEARS THEY HAVE PROVIDED

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.308
AUTHORIZATION FOR THESE PHASES.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.475
WE THINK A MORE INCREMENTAL

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.476
APPROACH MAKES MORE SENSE

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.145
APPROVING THE INITIAL PLANNING

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.746
PHASES FIRST AND THEN HAVING

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.081
UNIVERSITY COME BACK ON WHEN

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.215
MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.116
ON THE SCOPE OF THE

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.151
CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND THEN

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.752
AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.620
PHASE ONCE THAT INFORMATION IS

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.422
AVAILABLE. IT'S APPROACH THAT

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.257
THE STATE DOES TAKE FOR OTHER-

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.025
AGENCIES LIKE THE COMMUNITY

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.860
COLLEGES FOR EXAMPLE. I'M AND

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.062
WE THINK THAT APPROACH GIVES A

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.463
LEGISLATURE MORE INFORMATION ON

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.564
THE SCOPE OF THAT PHASE ONCE

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.832
MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.800
WE THINK THAT COULD BE HANDY

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.134
EVEN IN CASES LIKE A SEISMIC

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.136
RENOVATION THAT. ON PAPER OFTEN

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.738
MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD THAN A-

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.740
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:01.908
EXAMPLE FOR SEVERAL OF THE

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.409
SEISMIC RENOVATION PROJECTS-

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.144
CAMPUSES IN THEIR PROPOSALS TO

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.779
US NOTED THAT THERE STILL WHEN

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.948
SOME OF THE SCOPING DECISIONS-

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.383
FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THESE.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.484
BUILDINGS ARE CURRENTLY AT A

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.186
LEVEL SIX WHICH IS THE SECOND

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.754
THE WORST RATING YOU CAN HAVE

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.723
FOR A SEISMIC. OFFER A BUILDING

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.523
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.691
THEY'RE THERE SOME EXCITEMENT

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.493
PROJECTS THIS YEAR. IF YOU TURN

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.196
TO PAGE FIVE YOU CAN SEE V.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.097
ARMED. A LEVEL THAT THE

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.465
UNIVERSITY USES FOR SEISMIC

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.133
READINGS. AND CURRENTLY THE

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.801
PLAN IS TO GET AT LEAST TO A

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:29.736
LEVEL FOUR WHICH IS THE-

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.505
MINIMUM ACCEPTED STANDARD- OF

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.440
FOR. FOR A CLASSROOM BUILDINGS

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:36.209
AN ACADEMIC BUILDINGS. THE

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.176
CAMPUS IS NOTED THAT THERE

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.412
STILL WEIGHING THE OPTIONS OF

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.013
TRYING TO RENOVATE TO A LEVEL

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.547
THREE. AND THEY KNOW THAT THIS

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.915
CAN OFTEN BE A COMPLEX ANALYSIS

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.851
IT. ON THEIR THEIR HIGHER COSTS

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.219
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THERE IS

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.021
SOME BENEFITS SO THEY HAVE TO

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:48.688
WEAR THOSE INDIVIDUALLY BY EACH

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:49.856
PROJECT. THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.624
INFORMATION WE THINK THE

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:52.492
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.993
AT THE READY BEFORE ALL THE

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.228
FULLY AUTHORIZING THE

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:56.062
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WE

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.430
RECOMMEND. TAKING A MORE

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.998
CURRENT INCREMENTAL APPROACH

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.402
AUTHORIZING. THE INITIAL

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.202
PLANNING PHASES FIRST. THIS IS

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.437
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HERE

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.539
WITH THE UCAS OPPOSED TO.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.541
HAVING COME FROM BUDGETS OF

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:09.809
FOUR WERE WE DEALT WITH THESE

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.011
ON STATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.613
OVER THE SIX YEARS THAT I HEAR

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.581
THAT SUBCOMMITTEE A LITTLE BIT

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.883
DIFFERENT FROM YOU SEE IS AN

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.785
AND THAT THEIR OWN BINDING BE

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.620
UC'S BINDING CAPACITY IS THE-

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.188
IS THE CAPACITY IS BEING.

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.424
CHARGED WITH THE PROJECT CAN IN

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.259
MOST IF NOT ALL CASES EXCEPT

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.629
PERHAPS ONE. SERVED THE DEBT

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.597
SERVICING IS BEING COVERED BY.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.999
YOU SEE ISN'T IT IN THESE

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.537
PROJECTS. SO WHILE IT IS OUR

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.338
FUNCTION TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:40.807
AND CERTAINLY OUR FUNCTION TO

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.208
IMPROVE AND WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:43.810
WE'RE APPROVING WHEN WE- TAKE A

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.646
VOTE. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.114
A DIFFERENCE IN THESE PROJECT

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.717
VIS A VIS THE OTHER PROJECTS

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.052
AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.621
I EMBARK ON JUST BECAUSE OF THE

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.523
ARCHITECTURE WITH WHICH THESE

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.892
PROJECTS ARE STRUCTURED AND

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.227
THEN FINANCED BRECHT. IT'S TRUE

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.295
THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.362
THAT THE PROCESS IS VERY

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.299
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER- STATE

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.301
AGENCIES ARE USING STATE BONDS

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.870
THOSE. SO OFTEN REQUIRES AN

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.839
APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET-

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:13.339
THESE DON'T REQUIRE AN

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.907
APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET. ON

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.242
THEY'RE NOT USING STATE BONDS

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.877
THEY'RE USING UC'S BONDS ON

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.011
THEIR PAYING THE DEBT SERVICE

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.847
WITH THEIR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.549
DOESN'T REQUIRE. YEAH WITHIN

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.884
THE CAP THAT'S CORRECT DOESN'T

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.552
REQUIRE A DIRECT APPROPRIATION

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.287
FROM THE STATE OF THE STATE.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.222
SOMETIMES DOES ADJUST THEIR

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.457
BUDGET TO SERVE REFLECT THESE

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.626
AND OTHERS ARE COST INCREASES.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.393
WE STILL THINK AN INCREMENTAL

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.395
APPROACH MAKES SENSE DESPITE

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.597
THESE DIFFERENCES TO GIVE YOU

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:38.765
SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.866
SCOPE AND THEY'RE OPEN SOME

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.067
PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN AN

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.702
INCREMENTAL APPROACH. ON THERE

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.170
WAS A PROJECT I FORGET WHICH

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.271
CAMPUS IT WAS AND BUT THERE WAS

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.540
A PROJECT- I THINK WAS AT SANTA

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.108
CRUZ WHERE WE DID APPROVE THE

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.076
INITIAL PLANNING PHASES AND

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.244
THEN LATER THE CONSTRUCTION

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.245
PHASE SO IT'S NOT AN

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.813
UNPRECEDENTED TO TAKE FOR THESE

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.348
KINDS OF PROJECTS WELL

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.483
CERTAINLY WE EXPECTED. DUE

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.052
DILIGENCE IN A FAIRLY DETAILED

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.888
AMOUNT OF PLANNING TO GO INTO

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:02.822
THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE IT'S

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.956
OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.092
OCCURS BECAUSE AT THE END OF

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.827
THE DAY. THE STATE GENERAL FUND

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.962
MAY BE THE BACKSTOP. THAT'S

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.863
CORRECT IF THERE'S A

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.665
SIGNIFICANT ERROR YEAH I DIDN'T

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.534
MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF THAT'S OKAY

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.102
I CAN I AM HAPPY TO WALK

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.104
THROUGH SO WITH THAT WAS OUR

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:18.738
FIRST KIND OF BROAD COMMENT WE

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.506
HAVE TWO MORE. I'M OUR SECOND

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.441
SET OF CONCERNS RELATE TO THE

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.777
PROPOSAL OF THE PROJECT- IN

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.747
LINE SEVENTEEN WHICH IS AS I'M

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.715
SORRY ON PAGE SIX AGAIN. WHICH

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.752
IS A STAR SYSTEM WIDE- BUT VERY

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.954
PLANNING ACTIVITIES- IT'S AN

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:35.855
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR BONTA

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.490
FORTY THERE AND YOU'RE REALLY

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:39.258
LOOKING UT A NUMBER OF A VERY

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:41.527
PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM FIFTY

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.029
MILLION OF THIS WOULD FUND THE

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.730
INITIAL PLANNING PHASES OF

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.566
SEVERAL PROJECTS OTHERS

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.233
PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.401
SUMMARIZED INTERNET SIR TO FLIP

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:49.802
AROUND A LOT BUT ON PAGE SEVEN

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.172
YOU CAN SEE THE LIST OF THOSE

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:53.940
PROJECTS. I'M AN ORPHAN ABOUT

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.474
ARE YOU CONCERNED HERE'S JUST.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.910
PUZZLES CAME FAIRLY LATE I'M IN

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:58.978
THE PROPOSALS WERE SOMEWHAT

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.313
INCOMPLETE. THEY DIDN'T CONTAIN

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.581
A LOT OF INFORMATION YOU WE

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.182
NORMALLY GET ENOUGH CAPITAL

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.250
OUTLAY PROPOSAL THINGS LIKE A

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.818
FULL. DESCRIPTION OF THE

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.421
PROJECT JUSTIFICATION-

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:09.522
ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.557
CONSIDERED. AN INITIAL-

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.492
ESTIMATED TIME LINE INITIAL

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.328
ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.762
ON SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.130
INFORMATION TO. ASSESS THE

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.766
MERITS OF THESE PROPOSALS WERE

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.502
GIVEN THE- I WILL SAY APPARENT

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.105
DEMISE OF THE PROP SIX PROP

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.574
THIRTEEN. CONSTRUCTION BOND

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.577
STATEWIDE BOND WHAT IMPACT

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.046
ASSUMING THAT IS IN FACT THE

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.983
WHAT HAPPENS WHAT IMPACT WILL

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.451
THAT HAVE ON THE PARTICULAR

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:39.819
THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THE EIGHTY

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.455
MILLION- FOR PLANNING ACTIVITY

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:43.923
OTHER THIRTY GOOD QUESTION FOR

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.457
THE UNIVERSITY IN TE

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.892
ADMINISTRATION THEY THEY HAD

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.093
COMMUNICATED TO US THAT THEIR

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.961
INITIAL PLAN WAS TO USE UP ON

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.463
TO FUND THE LATER PHASES.

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:51.964
ANOTHER TOP ON DOESN'T APPEAR

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.101
THAT IT WILL PASS- BUT IT'S

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:55.735
KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION IN OUR

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.436
MIND- WHAT THE PLAN WOULD BE

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:58.604
THE PRESUMABLY THE UNIVERSITY

00:08:58.671 --> 00:08:59.872
COULD STILL CONTINUE TO USE

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.507
THEIR BONDS AND AFTER FROM THE

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:02.441
FUTURE COSTS BUT THAT WOULD BE

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:05.077
A GOOD THING TO EXPLORE WITH

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:05.645
THE UNIVERSITY. I'M JUST ON

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.013
THAT SO IT THERE WAS FIFTY

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.114
MILLION THERE'S ANOTHER THIRTY

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.181
MILLION IN THAT PROPOSAL AND

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:12.018
THAT IS FOR A SEPARATE-

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.819
INITIATIVE THAT WOULD FUND.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.621
ODDS ADDITIONAL SEISMIC STUDIES

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.590
FOR BUILDINGS ONLY THE

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:18.591
UNIVERSITY HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:19.625
SEISMIC STUDIES WITH ITS

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:22.028
EXISTING BUDGET ARM AND THE

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.396
THESE ARE STANDING IS THAT

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.864
THESE STUDIES APPEALED IT MORE

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.933
IN DEPTH AND WOULD HELP-

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.067
FURTHER DETERMINE THE SEISMIC

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.235
READINGS IN CASES WHERE THERE

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.737
ARE SOME WORDS STILL AMBIGUOUS

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.606
USING STANDARD METHODOLOGY. MY

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:34.373
UNDERSTANDING THERE'S SOME

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.509
ISSUE ABOUT. CAMPUS IS DOING

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.377
STUDIES BUT THE QUESTION WAS IS

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.046
WAS THE METHODOLOGIES.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.714
STANDARDIZED IN OR THE RESULT A

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.349
ROOF COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.584
AND- APPLES TO ORANGES YEAH

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.786
THAT WAS NOT REMEMBERING THE IS

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.254
YEAH THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.422
FOR MAINTENANCE PARTICULARLY

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.089
THEY WERE SOMETHING

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:50.990
UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.692
UNDERTAKING A SYSTEM WIDE STUDY

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.093
OF. THE CONDITION OF ITS

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.028
FACILITIES THAT AND WITH THE

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.863
AIM OF HAVING A MORE ACCURATE

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.764
ESTIMATE OF THEIR DEFERRED

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.166
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. THESE

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.467
STUDIES ARE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.768
DIFFERENT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.236
SEISMIC STRUCTURES FOR

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.071
BUILDINGS AND SO THEY'RE

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.405
LOOKING AT THEIR ABILITY TO

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.107
WITHSTAND SEISMIC FORCES. ON

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.542
THEY'VE CURRENTLY DONE A NUMBER

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.711
OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES WHICH

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.012
IN A LOT OF CASES IS. ON BUT IN

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.880
SOME CASES NOT ON THESE STUDIES

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:15.348
ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.149
QUANTITATIVE AND- ARE A LITTLE

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.184
MORE HANDS ON REQUIRE A LITTLE

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.719
BIT MORE DETAIL AND SO THAT'S-

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.787
THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:22.321
WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:22.888
STUDIES ARE. WE DON'T TAKE

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.557
ISSUE WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.891
THE STUDIES- OUR CONCERN HERE

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.127
IS THAT IT'S A- ONE TIME STUDY

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.762
AND AS YOU'VE HEARD US. COMMENT

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.597
BEFORE WE THINK BONDS ARE NOT

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.965
THE APPROPRIATE FOR A ONE TIME

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.533
STUDY I AGREE WITH WE THINK

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.167
CASH WOULD BE A BETTER

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:36.502
ALTERNATIVE WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.037
THE UNIVERSITY HAS. BEEN

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.872
APPEAR. APPEARS TO BE USING ITS

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.474
EXISTING BUDGET FOR A LOT OF

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.042
THE STUDIES ALSO HAS. A

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.677
RESERVES AND SO WE THINK THOSE

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.079
WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER- FUND

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.348
SOURCES THEN- BOND FUNDING. SO

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.384
WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT- THIS

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.585
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.720
ONCE ENTIRETY. THAT BEING SAID

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.055
IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.223
SIGNALING THE PRODUCTS DON'T

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.491
HAPPEN IT'S JUST SIGNALING

00:10:58.557 --> 00:10:59.625
EITHER THAT THE UNIVERSITY COME

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.160
BACK WITH. MORE INFORMATION

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:03.396
WERE COMPLETED- PROPOSALS OR

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.663
THAT IT USE EXISTING RESOURCES

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.731
IN THE CASE OF THE SEISMIC

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.867
STUDIES FOR WE- SUPPLEMENT THE

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:10.603
GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATION BY

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:11.771
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.072
SURE THE SEISMIC STUDIES DONE

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.507
STEP THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:15.808
OPTION THERE WOULD BE ONE TIME

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.176
IN THAT CASE AND PRESUMABLY

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.244
INSTEAD OF ON GOING DEPENDING

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.779
ON. THE NATURE OF THE STUDIES

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.214
SEISMIC STUDY WOULD BE PRETTY

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.382
IMPORTANT TO. PAYING FOR TO

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:24.483
ANOTHER ISSUE BUT WE CERTAINLY

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.551
NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:26.819
QUANTIFY WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.054
PROBLEM IS AND THEN FIGURE OUT

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.422
EVER GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. AND

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.623
YOU MIGHT RECALL LAST YEAR THE

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.025
STATE. ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL

READINGS AND SO IT'S AN

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.366
ACTIVITY THAT UC'S DOING IN.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.234
CONJUNCTION WITH EXPECTATIONS

MUCH EASIER FOR US TO SHUT DOWN

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.251
A BUILDING SO WE WANT TO

SEISMIC STUDIES. AND JUST A

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.091
NOTE THAT IT'S OFTEN THE CASE

HIGH SPEED RAIL BONDS OR PROP

OF IT IS USE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:32.971
TASKS. OKAY. IT WAS JUST I WAS

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:36.642
JUST REMINDED. OF THE WE DON'T

OTHER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.617
USED TO HAVE SO LET'S THINK

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.952
ABOUT SOME LANGUAGE TO THE

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.887
JOINT LEGISLATIVE- BUDGET

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:52.324
COMMITTEE ON THESE CONSTRUCTION

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.459
PROJECTS AND SEE IF THAT FORMAT

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.428
THAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO USING

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.597
I THINK WITH SOME OF THE TGS

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.666
MANAGE PROJECTS STATE

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:01.533
CONSTRUCTION AROUND HERE FOR

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.802
EXAMPLE. WE COULD APPLY THAT TO

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.437
THIS SO WE AT LEAST KNOW WHAT'S

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:08.974
GOING ON. IF LA IS CONCERNED.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.744
THAT MAKES SENSE. RIGHT GUEST

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.846
IS A QUESTION MAKE SENSE THE

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:15.681
STATEMENT AND THEN WE CAN

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:17.115
FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN DESIGN

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.350
SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.620
THAT MAKES SENSE. I'M I THINK

THEN THE SECOND WILL BE FOCUSED

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:05.310
ON UC RIVERSIDE'S- PLAN UNDER

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.511
THE PROPOSAL AND THEN THE THIRD

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:09.548
WOULD BE THE UCSF PROPOSAL. THE

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:10.649
THING ABOUT WORKFORCE ISSUES

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:13.552
BROADLY THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.620
TO BE AIMED AT AN INCREASING

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:16.955
THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.757
REGIONALLY. I'M IN THE CASE OF

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:20.525
RIVERSIDE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.160
IN THE CAS OF FRESNO IN THE

00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:23.795
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THE

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:24.663
EMPHASIS ON THESE REGIONS

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:26.031
APPEARS WARRANTED THESE REGIONS

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:28.266
DO YOU HAVE A LOW. OF SUPPLY

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.535
PHYSICIANS PER CAPITA RELATIVE

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.003
TO OTHER REGIONS IN THE STATE.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.772
I THINK THE THINK THE CRITICAL

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:34.906
ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.708
CONSIDER IS. THINKING ABOUT THE

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.143
BEST WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.445
REGIONAL- NEEDS. ON THE MISS

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:41.413
REGION'S PROPOSING INCREASING

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.014
MEDICAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENTS

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.482
THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE APPROACH

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:47.886
IT- LIKELY WILL HAVE- AN

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:49.187
INCREASE IN THE STATEWIDE

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:50.522
SUPPLY PHYSICIANS. REGIONAL

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.090
IMPACTS OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.759
A LITTLE BIT HARD TO EVALUATE-

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:55.894
AND THAT'S BECAUSE MEDICAL

00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:57.295
SCHOOL STUDENTS- AFTER

00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:59.030
COMPLETING MEDICAL SCHOOL GO ON

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:00.765
TO- COMPLETE POST GRADUATE

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.267
TRAINING. IN SOME CASES IN

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:02.968
DIFFERENT REGIONS WHERE THEY

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:04.536
COMPLETED MEDICAL SCHOOL AND

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:06.071
SOME ARGUE THAT STUDENTS WHEN

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:08.840
THEY GO ON TO DO THE RESIDENCY

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:09.274
PLANT ROOTS IN THOSE

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.843
COMMUNITIES. THE STATE HAS-

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:12.978
EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DO

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.346
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:16.014
PROGRAMS ANOTHER INCENTIVE

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:16.848
BASED PROGRAMS LIKE A LOAN

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.384
REPAYMENTS. THE PROGRAMS. COULD

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.719
HAVE A STRONGER REGIONAL

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.786
CONNECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE TIED

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.989
AT THE BACK END OF THE- OF THE

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:25.056
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:26.124
PIPELINE. THAT'S SAID THERE

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.759
ISN'T ENOUGH- EVIDENCE THAT ARE

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.294
A DATA ACROSS ALL THESE.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.862
PROPOSALS TO REALLY OFFER

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:31.730
SOMETHING MORE DEFINITIVE TO

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:34.766
THE LEGISLATURE SO JUST AN AREA

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:35.267
OF UNCERTAINTY AS YOU'RE

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:36.601
WEARING THESE PROPOSALS. I'M

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:38.303
MOVING ON TO UC RIVERSIDE THE

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.338
UC RIVERSIDE- DID SUBMIT TO US

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.740
A LONG TERM- MULTI YEAR PLAN

00:25:41.806 --> 00:25:43.341
UNDER THE PROPOSAL. AND THE

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:44.876
ELEMENTS OF THAT PLAN ARE

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:46.912
SUMMARIZED AT A HIGH LEVEL ON

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:49.681
PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.149
WE UNDERSTAND THE CRUX OF IT TO

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.318
BE ESSENTIALLY THREE. THINGS

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.953
THE FIRST IS IT WOULD ALSO

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.023
ALLOW THE CAMPUS TO- REPLACE

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.591
IT. AS AN EXISTING AMOUNT OF

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:01.493
SUPPORT THAT A PROVIDES TO ON

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:03.194
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL ABOUT SIX

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.130
MILLION. ON RE DIRECTED FOR

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.865
OTHER PRIORITIES IT SECONDLY

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:09.567
WOULD- ADDRESS A DEFICIT THAT

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:10.635
THE SCHOOLS EXPERIENCING IN THE

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:12.237
CURRENT YEAR. AND THEN THIRD AS

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.138
YOU WAIT AS THE ADMINISTRATION

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:14.606
NOTED A GROWN WOMAN THERE

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.474
HELPING TAT. AB THEY CURRENTLY

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.842
ENROLLED ABOUT EIGHTY STUDENTS

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:19.244
IN THE COHORT THEY'RE HOPING TO

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.379
UNROLL ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:22.514
FIVE STUDENTS IN THE COHORT WE

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.115
HAVE THREE ISSUES TO CONSIDER

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:25.984
AS REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL. OF

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.685
THE FIRST JUST TO GET MORE

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.987
INFORMATION ON THE CAMPUS IS

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:40.966
PLANNED TO RE DIRECT. SOME OF

00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:42.200
THE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OR OR

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.735
EXPECTING MORE MOMENT GROSS BUT

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.203
YOU WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH THE

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:45.770
SCHOOL TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:48.540
ELEMENTS OF THAT. ON THE

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.375
SECOND- ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:51.576
THAT A LOT OF THE ENROLLMENT

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.545
GROWTH- WOULDN'T OCCUR IN TOLL

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.647
ON. A LATER YEARS AND THAT'S

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.948
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL FIRST HAS TO

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:57.849
CONSTRUCT A BUILDING TO

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:58.783
ACCOMMODATE THE ENROLLMENT

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.151
GROWTH ONE OF THE FUNDING IS

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:02.120
COMING IN THIS YEAR- WENT WHEN

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:03.188
ISSUE WHEN IT CONSERVE YOU

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:04.756
COULD CONSIDER IS UP AS A-

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.291
APPROACH THAT FUNDS THE TIMES

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.859
THE FOUR. TIMES FUNDING CLOSER

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:08.727
TO WIN WOMAN GROWTH WOULD BE

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:10.028
OCCURRING. THAT'S A MORE

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.696
STANDARD PRACTICE- WHEN THE

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.798
STATE PROVIDES A MOMENT OF

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:15.100
FUNDING FOR THE SEGMENTS. AND

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:16.534
THE THIRD ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:18.837
CURRENT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL.DOESN'T HAVE AN ENROLLMENT

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:19.604
TARGET AND IT'S STANDARD

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:21.206
PRACTICE IN THE STATE BUDGET TO

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.741
SAID IN ROMAN TARGET. ON WHEN

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:23.875
THERE'S FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.511
GROWTH INSURES THAT- THIS STATE

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.213
COURT ON ITS EXPECTATIONS. AND

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:30.482
THEN MOVING JUST YOU SEE. UCSF

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.250
FRESNO THIS WAS A LITTLE

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.284
DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE ISN'T A

NOT HAVING A HOSPITAL AS A

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.672
LIMITED RUN RESOURCES SO IT'S A

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:28.673
TRADE OFF BETWEEN THIS

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.074

THAT GENERATE REVENUE TO THIS

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.346
TO FEED ITSELF. WE'VE GOT OUR

UNDER. UNDER CAPITALIZE FROM

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.452
THE BEGINNING- AND AS A RESULT-

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.454
WE'VE BEEN SUBSIDIZING FROM THE

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.455

ABOUT THIS FUNDING- GAP IN THE

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.504
FACT THAT WE WERE ALWAYS KIND

FOUR EIGHT LET'S LET'S TAKE IN

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.227
A CHEMIST WHEN WE HIRE A

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.528
CHEMIST IT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.130
TO DO THE RECRUITMENT THE

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.865

THANK YOU IN PROMOTE MANY OF A

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.422
HUGE INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT THEIR WORK BUT THEY CAN

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.824
SEE AN END TO THE RESEARCH WE

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.292
NEED TO. DEFEND A FIGHT

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.927
CORONAVIRUS. BUT YOU'RE ALSO

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.229
RIGHT A FAIR NUMBER THEM A

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.430
LARGE NUMBER OF THEM ARE

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.032
INVOLVED IN CLINICAL ACTIVITY

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:22.199
AND THAT MEANS ALL THIS

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.167
EMBEDDEDNESS ON PUTTING TALK A

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.102
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. I'M JUST

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.471
TO ADD TO THIS- THE CLINICAL

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.206
FALLACY THAT WE HAVE THAT WE

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:31.909
HIRE THEY NOT ONLY DO PLAN A

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.945
WAR BUT THEY ALSO. EDUCATION

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:37.314
AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE ARE

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.250
COMMUNITY BASED MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:41.385
WITHOUT A MEDICAL CENTER WE

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:43.921
CREATE VARIOUS PLATFORMS THAT

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.956
PROVIDE THE EDUCATION FOR ALL

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:48.325

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:28.011
BE LEVERAGED. IN AREAS LIKE THE

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.613
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT ARE NOT

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.281
HOME TO A MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.549
RIVERSIDE BY CONTRAST HAD A

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.384
LONG HISTORY WITH UCLA THAT

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:34.952
HELPED BUILD THIS

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.887
INFRASTRUCTURE SO I KIND OF BE

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.822
BEGIN WITH A DEMOGRAPHIC-

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.358
IMPERATIVE- SO WE'LL SWITCH NOW

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:42.593
FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE SAN

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:45.329
JOAQUIN VALLEY HERE YOU SEE-

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.997
THE REGION WITH EIGHT COUNTIES

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:49.499
IS HOME TO FOUR POINT THREE-

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.068
MILLION PEOPLE AND IS ALSO

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:52.603
AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING

00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:55.172
REGIONS OF THE STATE- SIMILAR

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.506
TO THE CHALLENGES WE KNOW THAT

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:58.976
EXIST FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE- WE

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.612
HAVE THE S. A. J. V. THAT. LAGS

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:04.214
IN VIRTUALLY ALL SOCIO ECONOMIC

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:05.983
AND HEALTH CARE INDICATORS

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.417
AGAIN AND I CAN SAY THAT I'VE

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.853
WATCHED THAT BE TRUE IN MY ROLE

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.154
AS COMMISSIONER I'VE WATCHED IT

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.090
BE TRUE AS WE WATCH MEDICAL

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.524
STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.159
STATE SEEK ADMISSION TO A

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.728
PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOL WITH NO

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:19.863
PLACE TO GO. INLAND EMPIRE

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.299
BEYOND S. JV HAVE HIGH RATES OF

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.568
POVERTY- THE S. JB IN

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.036
PARTICULAR HAS POOR AIR

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.971
QUALITY- TROUBLESOME FOR OUR

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.773
KIDS AND OLDER ADULTS AND YOU

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.208
SEE FOUR OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:31.942
ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:35.212
STATE- FOR THEIR RESIDENTS AND

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.648
HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO WE TALKED A

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:38.882
LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:41.752
SHORTAGES OF POSITIONS IN THE

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:43.520
INLAND EMPIRE THE SHORTAGES ARE

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.222
AS DIRE FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.891
VALLEY- YOU HAVE DATA BEFORE

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:50.127
YOU AND I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:51.695
BUT IT IS AVAILABLE SHOULD IT

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.997
BE OF. INTEREST THAT THIS EIGHT

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.432
COUNTY REGION HAS AMONG THE

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.801
LOWEST RATES OF PROVIDERS- IN

00:48:57.868 --> 00:48:59.636
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:02.272
NATION WITH REALLY A GENERATION

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.041
OF PROVIDER SLATED TO RETIRE

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.909
AND ALL ALL PUT A PAUSE ON.

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:08.712
THAT BECAUSE- I SPEND TIME WITH

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.780
COLLEAGUES IN A NATIONAL

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:11.882
CONTEXT IN TERMS OF MEDICAL

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:12.616
SCHOOLS THE CHANCELLOR

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:14.618
MENTIONED. THE EYES OF MEDICAL

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:16.019
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.821
WATCHING FOR THEIR SUCCESS IN

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:20.257
THE INVESTMENT OF YOU SEE ARE.

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:23.493
ON BUT ALL ALL ALSO SAY THAT WE

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.164
KNOW A LOT ABOUT- DEMANDS FOR

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.899
MEDICAL STUDENT EDUCATION THE

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:30.400
THINGS THAT LEVERAGE SUCCESS

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:31.902
THE PREDICTIVE VALUE WHICH

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.370
INCLUDES RESIDENCY TRAINING BUT

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:34.905
WHAT'S PREDICTIVE OF. WHERE

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:35.972
STUDENTS WERE ULTIMATELY

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.407
PRACTICES WHERE THEY HAVE TIES

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.975
TO THEIR COMMUNITY. DO YOU SEE

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.277
OUR IN OUR EXTRAORDINARY

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:42.079
MEDICAL STUDENT HERE WITH TIES

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:43.814
TO THE COMMUNITY THE OBVIOUS

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.816
PART OF THAT AND RIVERSIDE HAS

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.517
PREFERENTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:48.518
STUDENTS WHO COME FROM THE

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.287
REGION. PROGRAM ALL TALK ABOUT

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.822
SHORTLY WOULD ALSO SIMILARLY

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.357
HAVE PREFERENTIAL CONSIDERATION

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:54.224
FOR STUDENTS THAT COME FROM THE

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.826
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BECAUSE WE

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.661
KNOW THIS IS PREDICTED. AND IF

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:58.929
WE KEEP THEM THERE AND TRAIN

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.964
THEM THERE WE STACKED TOGETHER

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:02.532
THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:04.601
OVER. DECADES AND DECADES OF

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.903
TIME ABOUT HOW TO ENHANCE THE

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.972
LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENTS GOING

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.073
THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL THEN

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.308
TRAINING AND THEN ENTERING

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.843
PRACTICE FOR ENTIRE PRACTICE

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:14.911
CAREER IN A REGION. THERE'S NOT

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:17.447
ANY INDICATION THAT STUDENTS

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:20.984
FROM- OTHER COMMUNITIES WITH NO

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.252
CONNECTION ARE LIKELY TO

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:25.622
MIGRATE. ON SO. I EASY YOU SEE

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.324
THE EVIDENCE OF THIS IS LOW-

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.126
CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE HAS AMONG

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.128
THE OLDEST PHYSICIANS. IN THE

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.162
NATION I THINK WERE MAYBE

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.664
BEHIND IN MEXICO- THAT MEANS

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.966
THE SHORTAGES THAT OFSTED

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.701
REPORTS ON EVERY YEAR THOSE ARE

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:38.935
GOING TO GROW WE'RE WE'RE

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:42.205
LOSING PACE- OUR RELIANCE ON IN

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:43.740
MIGRATION OF. STUDENTS AND

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.709
RESIDENTS TRAINED ELSEWHERE IS

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:46.576
NOT FILLING THE GAP THE GAPS

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:47.844
ARE WIDENING AND WHEN THIS

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.312
WHOLE GENERATION GETS READY TO

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:52.015
RETIRE OVER THIS NEXT YEAR-

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:54.384
THOSE THOSE SHORTAGES ON WHAT

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.819
WILL BE GREATER TODAY- THAN

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.154
THEY ARE. SO YOU SEE IT'S A

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.356
FRESNO- I THINK IS THE TITLE

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:01.425
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S- LINE ITEM

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:03.627
BUT LET ME SAY THAT THAT BEGAN

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.762
FORTY THAT THAT. THAT PROGRAM

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.063
IS PRIMARILY GRADUATE MEDICAL

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.398
EDUCATION FOCUS THIS IS

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:09.966
RESIDENCY TRAINING IT'S BEEN IN

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.502
EXISTENCE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS.

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:16.740
UCSF AND UC DAVIS SEND STUDENTS

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:17.741
IT'S ALSO HOME TO MEDICAL. FROM

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:20.310
OTHER SCHOOLS WHERE IT- IS

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:22.245
POSSIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE THEM SO

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.580
WE HAVE EXPERIENCE TEACHING

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.248
FACULTY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.584
RESIDENCY PROGRAM- THAT HAVE A

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.453
RECORD OF SUCCESS IN PREPARING

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.388
THE REGION'S WORKFORCE. WHICH

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:32.722
IS THE AIM OF THE SCHOOL OF

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.157
MEDICINE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.525
GM ME FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:36.393
IT'S PROVEN IT'S PREVENT

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.494
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT'S

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.995
PROVEN IN THIS STATE. WE JUST

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.330
DON'T HAVE THOSE TYPES OF

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.865
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.334
THIS REGION- OF CALIFORNIA SO

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:47.103
THIS FOUNDATION AT UCSF IS.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.440
REALLY ON THE CRITICAL RESOURCE

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.409
FOR MEDICAL STUDENT ROTATIONS

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:53.376
FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING FOR

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.045
REGIONAL PRODUCTS PRESENCE THAT

00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:56.746
WOULD LEVERAGE. CLINICAL

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:59.216
FACULTY EXPERIENCE FACULTY- WHO

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.217
KNOW HOW TO TEACH FROM THE HOW

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.451
TO TRAIN RESIDENTS RESIDENTS

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.053
ARE INTEGRAL TO THE INSTRUCTION

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.654
OF MEDICAL STUDENTS SO. THAT

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:07.491
YOU CASF RUST ON FRESNO MEANS

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:08.592
THAT THAT RESOURCE DOES NOT

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:09.759
HAVE TO BE BUILT IT'S AN AND

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:10.760
DURING STATE RESOURCE THAT

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.662
COULD BE LEVERAGED- FOR THIS

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.164
PURPOSE. WE DID WE JUST MAKE A

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:17.534
COMMENT. I HAVE BEEN A

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.504

MEDICAL SCHOOL OPERATION. IN

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:25.308
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE TIME I

ARRIVED HERE. IN THE BEGINNING

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.881
OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.883
SAME TIME THAT I CAME UP AND

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.684
OBVIOUSLY WAS ADVOCATING AS A

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.086
REPRESENTATIVE FOR AND SO THE

THAT ACTUALLY LEAVING HIS MY

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:47.297
TIME RIGHT NOW IS ALL COVERED

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.398
NINETEEN I THOUGHT AS I LEFT MY

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.000
STAFF AND HOME AND I WAS LIKE

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:50.767
IT'S A COMMITTEE WHO

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.035
UNDERSTANDS THESE ISSUES AND I

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:54.004
I'M ALSO PERSONALLY GRATEFUL

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:01.845
TANGIBLE BENEFITS OF.

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.880
ESTABLISHING A OF A MEDICAL

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.348
SCHOOL IN A PARTICULAR REGION

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:07.384

US THROUGH- OF THE MEDIC HERE A

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:34.377
RELATED PROGRAMS- BUT THEY'RE

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.479
ALSO INTANGIBLE BENEFITS TO

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.848
ESTABLISHING. A MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:41.117
IN A REGION THAT ARE ALMOST IN

00:53:41.184 --> 00:53:42.986
SOME CASES IN CAPABLE OF BEING

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.055
MEASURED OR QUANTIFIED AND

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.556

ABOUT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.394
METRICS. BUT I DO READ

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.530
RECOGNIZE ON OCCASION THERE ARE

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:55.298
INTANGIBLE BENEFITS THEY'RE

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:56.733
HARD TO MEASURE YET ARE JUST AS

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.169
VALUABLE. AS THE TANGIBLE STUFF

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:01.638
SO I DON'T WANT TO BE. SEND

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:03.139
YOUR TRAIN OFF THE TRACK BUT I

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:09.512
WE- DO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.548
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:12.816
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.684
HAVE THESE OPTIONS AND I

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.252
REALIZE THEIR POLITICS UP THERE

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.588
AND- WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:21.358
COGNIZANT OF THAT SO. OKAY IS

00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:23.994
SO I'M A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.329
WORK WITH THE UCSF LEADERSHIP

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.198
MY DIRECT INVOLVEMENT WITH THE

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:30.400
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT WITH MERCED

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:33.503
WITH UCSF FRESNO ON WE HAD THE

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.170
BENEFIT OF THE STATE'S

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.805
INVESTMENT IN OUR SAN JOAQUIN

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:37.540
VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM I'M AN

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.142
ORIGINAL ARCHITECT OF THE PRIME

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:41.778
PROGRAM THAT STANDS FOR STANDS

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.146
FOR PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.615
EDUCATION. BEST AB PROGRAM IS

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:46.683
OUR ONLY GEOGRAPHICALLY

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.284
DESIGNATED PRIME PROGRAM

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:49.719
MEANING IT FOCUSES ON THE

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.555
REGION SO WE'VE GOT OTHERS ON-

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.324
BUT THAT FOCUS OF AIR SO THAT

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.159
ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE FIVE

00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:57.661
MILLION THAT THAT WAS PROVIDED

00:54:57.727 --> 00:55:00.063
A SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS MODELED

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:00.964
ON A MEDICAL STUDENT-

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.199
CONTRIBUTION OF THIRTY FIVE

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.100
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MEDICAL

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:06.536
STUDENTS THIS DOESN'T COVER THE

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:07.971
COST. INSTRUCTION OR

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.673
SUPERVISION COSTS ARE HIGHER

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.374
WHEN YOU HAVE SMALLER CLASSES

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:12.876
THIS COMES ALSO WITH TUITION

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.210
BUT THAT WAS THE MODEL AND THE

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.946
BASIS FOR THAT FIGURE- AT THAT

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.882
TIME SO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.650
DOLLARS PER STUDENT. TO SUPPORT

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:23.486
AN ULTIMATE TOTAL ENROLLMENT OF

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:24.454
FORTY EIGHT MEDICAL STUDENTS

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.489
COOPER CLASS- LAST YEAR WITH

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.458
THE INCOMING- CLASS OF FIRST

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:30.360
YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS. BY

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:31.528
LEADERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH A

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:32.929
COMMITMENT ON THIS REGION WE

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.898
MIGRATED TO- DEAL SAMMY

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:37.734
ACCREDITING SCHOOL FOR AS JV

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.370
FROM THE DAVIS CAMPUS. TO UCSF

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:41.971
AND THIS IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.740
OF CALENDARS AND TO LEVERAGE

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:46.376
THAT RELATIONSHIP AT UCSF AND

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:47.677
THE RESPONSIBILITY THE UCSF

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.079
HOUSE. FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:51.214
EDUCATION SO THIS WAS A SHARED

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.082
DECISION THAT THIS WAS IN THE

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:53.616
REGION'S BEST INTEREST TO MY

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:56.086
GREAT THIS. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:58.588
SEVENTEEN- AND I WOULD SAY THAT

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.990
LEADERSHIP- COMMITMENT TO

00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:02.492
WORKING ON THIS ACROSS

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.327
LOCATIONS HAS BEEN HIGH AND

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.695
GENUINE IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.263
FOR ME TO BE PART OF IT-

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.399
THROUGHOUT WE RETAIN DELOITTE

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.601
ON TO HELP US LOOK ON. LOOK AT

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.703
MODELS AND SO THIS WAS NOT

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.105
ANTICIPATING THE THIS YEAR'S

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:16.706
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS WAS TO

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.675
MOVE FORWARD WITH A VISION FOR

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:19.876
WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.811
EXPANDING MEDICAL EDUCATION. SO

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.013
WE LOOKED AT A HYBRID MODEL WE

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.949
LOOKED AT TWO YEARS AT UCSF.

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.450
FOR BASIC SCIENCES TWO YEARS AT

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.786
FRESNO WE LOOK AT A FULL BRANCH

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:31.287
CAMPUS MODEL THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.690
GREATER INVESTMENT RIGHT WITH

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.892
TWO YEARS AT UCSF FRESNO WARMER

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.160
SAID. THERE'S VALUE IN

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:38.962
CONTINUITY OF MEDICAL EDUCATION

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:40.864
IN OUR REGION. AND WE LOOK AT A

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:43.566
JOINT MODEL WITH- SO EITHER

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:46.269
BASIC SCIENCES AT UCSF. FRESNO

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:48.204
OR AT RISK SAID BUT RECOGNIZING

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:48.838
WE NEED TO BUILD THE

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.574
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPABILITY

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.408
FOR TEACHING. AS WE CONTINUE

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:55.779
THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THIS- WITH

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.447
THIS LEADERSHIP GROUP AND

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:58.548
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WE

00:56:58.615 --> 00:56:59.983
BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT AN

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:01.251
ALTERNATIVE MODEL AND THAT WAS

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.353
FIRST PROPOSED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:04.954
NINETEEN AND THAT MODEL IS-

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.323
UNIQUE WITHIN THE STATE- AND

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.893
ALIGNS. VERY NICELY WITH THE

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:10.860
NEEDS AND THE VISION FOR THIS

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:13.096
PROGRAM- GOING FORWARD THIS

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:15.165
WOULD BE A COMBINED. AND THE

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:17.167
ONLY SUCH PROGRAM OF ITS TYPE

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.668
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:19.502
WHICH WOULD BE A COMBINED

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:23.807
BACCALAUREATE- MD PROGRAM. THIS

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:25.441
WOULD BE AN EIGHT YEAR PROGRAM.

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:28.144
WITH INCOMING FRESHMEN-

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.814
ADMITTED TO A- TRACK IN A

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.515
PROGRAM WITH ACADEMIC

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:35.084
ENRICHMENT AND SUPPORT AND

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.220
GUIDANCE. FUNNELING THEM

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.923
THROUGH- A PROCESS. LEADING TO

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:42.492
A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE FROM UC

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:44.894
MERCED. AT AND ENABLING THEN

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:45.929
THE TRANSITION TO BECOME A

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.630
FIRST YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT.

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.933
WHERE FROM WHERE FOUNDATIONS IN

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.301
MEDICAL EDUCATION COULD BE

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:54.170
TAUGHT AGAIN. CONTINGENT AS- MY

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.338
CAN COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT OF

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:58.241
OBSERVED ON ADEQUATE. STABLE

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.109
FUNDING TO SUPPORT EDUCATION WE

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.477
CAN'T STOP AND START THESE

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.179
THINGS AND PUT OUR CAMPUS

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.547
REPUTATIONS AT RISK FOR OUR

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.082
STUDENTS AT RISK TO ACT AND

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.450
THIS DOES REQUIRE ADVANCE

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:08.585
INVESTMENT FOR THE REASONS THE

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.486
CHAMP ON DEAN HAVE DESCRIBED WE

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:11.054
NEED TO HAVE THE FACULTY IN

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.789
PLACE TO DO THIS. BUT STUDENTS

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:13.723
COULD COMPLETE THEIR

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.658
UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE. ON THE

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:18.995
LCM ME- WOULD RECOGNIZE UNDER

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:21.064
THIS MODEL AND WE'RE DOING- A

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.799
GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVE MODELING

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.767
AS WE SPEAK AND THERE WILL BE

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.402
THE ABILITY TO COME BACK. I

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.271
THINK AND THREE TO FOUR WEEKS

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.206
WITH MORE DETAIL ON BUDGET AND

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:32.809
USE AND SITE AND TIMING- BUT

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:33.877
BUT I'M PREPARED TO SPEAK A

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:34.911
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MAY BE

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.513
POSSIBLE- TODAY SO THIS EIGHT

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.850
YEAR PROGRAM- COULD POTENTIALLY.

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.685
INTENTION AGAIN UPON STABLE

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.988
OPERATING ROSE- REVENUES AT

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.856
ADMITTED CLASS OF TWELVE

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:49.592
STUDENTS WITH THE FALL CLASS OF

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.261
TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHICH IN

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:54.530
MEDICAL EDUCATION. THESE WOULD

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:55.798
NOT BE MEDICAL STUDENTS THESE

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.500
WOULD BE FRESHMEN RIGHT I MEAN

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:59.903
SO THE ADMISSIONS IS AHEAD OF

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.871
OUR- WITH MISSION PROCESS IS

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:02.705
THE HEAD OF THE MOVE OF

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.440
STUDENTS TO CAMPUS TO BEGIN AN

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.910
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.878
YEAR AND NEXT WOULD BE AIMED AT

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.514
AT PLANNING- PREPARATION OF

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:13.016
MERCED FACULTY INVESTMENT OF

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.817
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE THIS

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:17.620
POSSIBILITY BUT THIS IS- WHERE

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.589
WE ARE IN DIALOGUE WHICH IS.

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.157
VERY ACTIVE- AMONG THE

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:22.525
LEADERSHIP OF THE SITES THAT I

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.627
HAVE NAMED- IF THIS WERE

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:27.897
POSSIBLE. THE UC MERCED CAMPUS

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.899
COULD OPERATE AS A REGIONAL

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.167
CAMPUS OF THE UCSF SCHOOL OF

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:34.003
MEDICINE. WHERE SITE IS NOT

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.471
AUTHORIZED OR CREDITED BY THE

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:36.973
LCM ME AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.308
INFRASTRUCTURE ANYTIME IN THE

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.310
NEA FUTURE AND ON ITS OWN SO

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.178
THIS LEVERAGES CAPABILITY AND

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.314
SCALE OF A LONGSTANDING TOP

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.782
MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:47.684
BY ABILITY WHICH I AGAIN WE'VE

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.118
SETTLED LAW ALL ALONG ITS

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:50.586
MISSION ALIGNED WE KNOW HOW TO

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:53.156
DO THIS- THE FACULTY AT RISK

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.023
SAID. WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.591
RECRUITED TO DO THIS TEACHING

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:56.626
THERE IS NO MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:58.361
FACULTY EVEN FOR A SMALL COHORT

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:02.398
pNEED TO BE IN A POSITION TO

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.968
TEACH THE UCS OF CURRICULUM SO

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.136
THE L. SAMMY REQUIRES-

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:09.072
COMPARABILITY. INDEPENDENT OF

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.740
GEOGRAPHY GEOGRAPHIC SITE

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.375
MERCED WOULD NOT HAVE DEGREES

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.243
OF FREEDOM TO DO SOMETHING LAST

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.212
BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW PROGRAM.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.181
STUDENTS IN A UCS UP PROGRAM

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.782
REGARDLESS OF SITE WE NEED TO

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.584
BE ASSURED OF THE SAME ACCESS

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.252
TO ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS THE

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:24.554
SAME CALIBER OF INSTRUCTION THE

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.621
SAME LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.590
PREPARING THEM TO GRADUATE WITH

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:28.925
A MEDICAL DEGREE SO JUST SO I

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.526
UNDERSTAND IT'S SOMETHING

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.862
SIMILAR BUT NOT. TOTALLY

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.031
SIMILAR TO WHAT UNIVERSITY OF

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.033
CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE HAD BEEN

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.502
DOING FOR YEARS PRIOR TO TWO

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.203
THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO THE

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.337
STUDENTS WHO WERE ADMITTED

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.405
WOULD COMPLETE THEIR FOR YOU

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.174
THE NORMAL FOUR YEARS OF AN

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.442
UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM HOWEVER

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.077
THERE ADMITTED. AND THEN

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.846
COMPLETE THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:53.182
THE BASIC SCIENCE. CURRICULUM

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:53.983
FOR OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.619
CURRICULUM. IF THIS PLAN

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:57.220
HAPPENS TO BE THE ONE THAT'S

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.722
ADOPTED. AT THE UC MERCED

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:02.291
CAMPUS. TAUGHT IN THOSE TWO

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:05.595
YEARS USING THE UCSF. CARRILLO

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.697
CURRICULUM BY. A RECRUITED

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:10.166
FACULTY WHO ARE. ACCUSTOMED TO

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.001
TEACHING MEDICAL STUDENTS. AND

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.336
THEN MOVING IN IT THERE'S

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.704
ACTUALLY I WON'T TAKE THAT

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.439
COMMITTEES TIME THIS THIS

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:17.407
MORNING BECAUSE THE DOUBLES IN

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.541
THE DETAIL AND IT THIS IS

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.942
COMPLEX TERRITORY THAT'S

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.778
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET RIGHT. ON

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:22.912
BUT WE ACTUALLYBE CLOSER TO

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.047
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.249
WOULD BE AT UC MERCED TO ALIGN

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.518
WITH UCSF PRACTICES OF TO.

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.119
SPLIT INTO A BRIDGES CURRICULUM

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.455
THAT LAND WOULD END ITSELF-

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.623
BUT BUT FOR OBSERVATION THAT

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:34.791
THIS WOULD BE THE UCSF

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.426
CURRICULUM. IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.494
WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.029
YOU CASF TO BE THE DEGREE

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.998
GRANTING- MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.499
THE STUDENTS AND THEN AFTER

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.101
THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER YOU

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.969
SEE MERCED A FLIP SOMEWHERE

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.671
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD GO TO THE

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:49.305
REGIONAL CAMPUS A SECOND

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.240
REGIONAL CAMPUS OF UCSF WHICH

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.976
IS YOU CASF- PRESENT PRESS NO.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.878
FOR CLINICAL CLERKSHIPS MOST OF

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.181
WHICH ARE LONG ESTABLISHED AND

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.382
THEY WOULD COMPLETE SELECTIVE

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:02.585
ROTATIONS WHERE THOSE EXIST

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.220
WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL ARRAY.

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.121
MEDICAL STUDENTS SOMETIMES

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.123
ROTATE TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.691
DEPENDING UPON THE SPECIALTY

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.692
THEY MIXED SO THAT WOULDN'T

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.461
PRECLUDE THAT OPTION- THE

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:13.262
BENEFIT HERE. IS THAT THIS

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.897
PROGRAM WOULD BE INTENTIONALLY

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.599
DESIGNED IN A MANNER THAT IS

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.901
VERY YOU UNIQUE BY EITHER I'M

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.103
VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.205
OF THE RIVERSIDE PROGRAM. AND

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:23.106
YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THERE ARE

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.140
SIMILARITIES BUT THERE ARE

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.109
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES-

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.111
ADMISSION OF STUDENTS INTO THIS

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.313
TRACK IS TO INCOMING FRESHMEN.

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.215
WOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.150
STUDENTS FROM THE REGION. RIGHT

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.518
THE THIS THAT THIS PROGRAM

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.453
WOULD BE NOT LOOKING TO ADMIT

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.022
STUDENTS FROM WEST WOULD. OR

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.691
SAN DIEGO THE STUDENT WOULD

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:42.558
THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:46.829
PRIORITIZE. THE RECRUITMENT OF

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:47.463
INCOMING FRESHMEN WITH TIES TO

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.264
THE TO THE BROADER REGION NOT

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.298
JUST MERCED COUNTY BUT THE

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:50.666
BROADER AND BROADER INLAND

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:51.968
EMPIRE AND YOU SEE THAT BY HIGH

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.936
SCHOOL LOCATION FAMILY TIES ALL

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:54.904
THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD KNOW

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.439
WELL. IT MUST BE AN INNOVATIVE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:57.740
PROGRAM SO YOU'RE IN YOU'RE IN

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.275
ESSENCE TAKING WHAT THE MEDICAL

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:00.443
SCHOOL CURRENTLY DOES FOR

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.444
MEDICAL STUDENTS AND EXPANDING

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:03.246
IT. MOVING IT BACK TO THE

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.747
BEGINNING OF THE COLLEGE

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.349
EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND THERE

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.683
ARE FEW OF THESE PROGRAMS IN

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.619
THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE A

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.654
RECORD. OF SUCCESS IN TERMS OF

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:15.158
DIVERSITY- THERE ARE NOT MANY

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:15.691
THIS WOULD HAVE THE ADDED

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:18.427
BENEFIT OF BEING UNIQUE AMONG.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.996
ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.398
UC MERCED CAMPUS- WHICH IS ALSO

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.801
LIKE RIVERSIDE GROWING QUICKLY-

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.069
WITH WITH STUDENTS WHO COME

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.371
FROM THE REGION IS INCOMING

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.540
UNDERGRADUATES. ON THIS WOULD

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:33.142
BE A DIFFERENTIATOR BECAUSE IT

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:33.709
WOULD BE THE ONLY EIGHT YEAR

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.412
PROGRAM. YES AND MD IN THE

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.915
STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND ALL

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.816
COME COME BACK FOR ONE MINUTE

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.920
ON. THE RELEVANCE OF THESE

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.488
INVESTMENTS OF THE STATE OF

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.556
CALIFORNIA WE'VE WE'VE NOT

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.090
APPRECIATE. BANDED MEDICAL

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.225
STUDENT ENROLLMENT

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.294
OPPORTUNITIES- FOR DECADES. AND

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.529
TELL. RIVERSIDE WE HAVE A PRIME

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:55.531
INITIATIVE WHICH IS NOT A TOPIC

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.233
FOR TODAY BUT THAT WAS SOME

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.868
ENROLLMENT EXPANSION. WITHIN

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.536
OUR EXISTING SCHOOLS. THERE IS

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.338
THERE ARE STILL NOT INVESTMENT

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.806
OF STATE FUNDING FOR TWO THIRDS

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.375
OF THOSE SLOTS- BUT WHAT WE DO

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.810
KNOW IS WORTH THE BOTTOM IN THE

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.378
NATION AND MEDICAL STUDENT

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:11.814
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR STUDENTS

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.549
ATTENDING MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:16.519
NATION BUT- WE ARE AT THE TOP

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.354
OF THE NATION IN TERMS OF THE

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.422
RETENTION OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.724
STUDENTS WE EDUCATE HERE AND

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.259
THAT IS MISSION ALIGNED SO FOUR

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.094
OF OUR SIX UC MEDICAL SCHOOLS

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:27.129
ADMIT A 100% CALIFORNIA'S

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.098
STUDENTS YOU SEE A SEVEN UCLA

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:31.200
DID YOU TAKE STUDENTS- FROM

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.134
OTHER STATES WHO ARE

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.036
EXCEPTIONALLY- COMPETITIVELY

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.805
ELIGIBLE. BUT WE KNOW

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:36.739
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO WANT TO

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:39.275
STAY HERE ON ONE REMAIN HERE

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.911
THEIR FAMILY TIES AND SO IF

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.779
THERE IS PROOF AND EVIDENCE OF

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:46.082
THE VALUE OF THE RETURN ON THE

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.650
INVESTMENT OF STATE RESOURCES

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.785
WHICH WE'VE- NOT UNFORTUNATELY

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.721
SEEN VERY LITTLE OF- BUT BUT I

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:52.822
THINK THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:55.725
INVESTING IN. YOU SEE AS THE

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.059
STATE'S PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOLS

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.527
THE PRIORITIZE THE ADMISSION

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.595
AND TRAINING OF OUR OWN

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.664
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAS PROVEN

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.898
A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT BY

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:05.201
EVERY NATIONAL MEASURE- SO THIS

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:08.671
IS WHERE WE- WHERE WE ARE WE

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.306
BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE IN A

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.441
POSITION WITH MORE DETAILS TO

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:17.546
FOLLOW TO IT TO ADMIT- IN. FALL

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.682
TWENTY TWENTY TWO- PORT OF THE

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:20.983
FIRST WE WOULD CONTINUE OUR S.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.252
JB PRIME PROGRAM. SO THIS IS A

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.820
MEDICAL SCHOOL WE WOULD COULD

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.355
BEGIN A FRESHMAN PROGRAM IT

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:28.658
MERCED. CRIME WOULD CONTINUE IT

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.059

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.595
STUDENTS AT UCSF- WITH WITH THE

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:35.398
CLASS NEXT YEAR- UCSF HAS RE

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.500
ORDER ORIENTED THEIR OUTREACH

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:38.701

ADMIT AND RECRUIT TIME STUDENTS

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.470

THERE IS IN A IN A MORE ROBUST

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.174
WAY THAT WE THINK WILL ADD SOME

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:48.611
VALUE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE WELL I

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:49.545

COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTRAL

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.386

TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FEW

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.295
YEARS INCLUDING THIS

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.797
ALTERNATIVE MODEL. TO CREATE A

FOUNDATION AND A BONAFIDE

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:46.035
FUTURE PATHWAY. FORMER SAID TO

OF THE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:53.976
AND THE TEACHING CAPABILITY

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:57.113
WITH A SMALL PROGRAM LEVERAGING

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:58.714
UCSF. ACCREDITATION PAVES THE

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.816
WAY NOT ONLY FOR GROWTH AGAIN

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.284
OPERATING MONEY SEE FOR ME

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.920

ADDITIONAL FACULTY. THIS

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.992
PROGRAM WOULD START SMALL- BUT

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:10.960
IT WOULD HAVE CONCURRENT

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.528
NUMBERS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS AND

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.163
UNDERGRADUATES RIGHT THAT COULD

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.166
SCALE TO- FULLY ENROLLED SCHOOL

THE WISH OF THE STATE AND THERE

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.103
WERE THE ADEQUACY OF

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.071
INVESTMENTS THAT'S WITH.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.639
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNIQUE AN

HISTORY BUT IF AND WHEN I SIT

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:54.303
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.140
HAVE BEEN. IF IN NINETEEN

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:58.741

STATE GENERAL FUNDS UNLESS IT'S

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.571
SIGNIFICANT IS NOT ENOUGH TO

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.639
COVER INFLATIONARY COSTS FOR

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:39.608
ALL CAMPUS OPERATIONS BECAUSE

SINCE THAT'S 42% OF THE

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.783
OPERATIONS FOR THE CAMPUSES

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:36.852

BECOMES ABOUT A 2% INCREASE. SO

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.969
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE

LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR BUDGET

COST INCREASES. AND WHILE IT

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.478
SEEMS LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:12.814
THAT EQUATES TO JUST TWO POINT

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:16.885
8% INCREASE ON SOME OF THE CORE

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.054

INFLATIONARY INCREASES IN

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:06.468

YOU CAN- THIS GRAPH HERE

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:17.179
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE HAVE

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.880
BEEN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.615
INTO OUR STUDENTS AND THE PER

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.884
STUDENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:25.854
ACTUALLY INCREASING FROM THE

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.356
BOTTOM OF THE RECESSION TO NOW

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:29.925
AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:31.893
VERY GENEROUS LOOK PROVIDING US

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.929
ANNUAL INCREASES SINCE TWENTY

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:36.131
TWELVE UNTIL NOW. UP TO ALLOW

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:38.166
US TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.535
AND TO INCREASED ENROLLMENT IN

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.605
THE UNIVERSITY BUT THERE ARE A

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.240
FEW THINGS I'D LIKE YOU TO NOTE

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.409
HERE ONE IS THE SIGNIFICANT

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.978
INCREASE IN THE NON RESIDENT

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:54.549
TUITION. IN THE. SO ARE NON

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:56.985
RESIDENT STUDENTS PAY OF. PAY

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.187
QUITE A BIT THEY PAY ALMOST

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:00.055
THIRTY THOUSAND AND NON

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.022
RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.258
TO US OF THAT AMOUNT WE ONLY

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:07.862
NEED ABOUT OF ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.231
TO ACTUALLY EDUCATE THEM THE

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:11.900
REST GOES INTO THE CAMPUS

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.702
OPERATING BUDGETS TO HELP

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.570
SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THE

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.973
INSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS OF

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.941
THE CAMPUSES ALL OUR STUDENTS.

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:20.809
SO IF THOSE FUNDS ARE

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.744
RESTRICTED THAT WOULD CREATE

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:25.080
SOME PROBLEMS FOR OUR CAMPUSES

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:26.648
WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT RIGHT

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.416
OUT YOU'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:29.985
JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.987
THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD GREAT UP

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.521
SOME ISSUES FOR US. AND

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.857
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL NOT CONTINUE

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.426
TO NOT PROPOSED THAT. OF BUT

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.495
THEN WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.330
EVEN THOUGH THE FUNDING PER

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.298
STUDENT HAS CONTINUED TO

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.066
INCREASE SLIDE NINE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.768
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE ARE

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:48.169
CERTAIN COST INCREASES AS WELL

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.304
THAT THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.440
AVOID. THAT ARE EATING INTO

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:54.542
THAT PER STUDENT DOLLAR AMOUNT

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:56.645
THAT WE HAVE OF ONE OF THE

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.447
BIGGEST OF THESE IS UC RP THE

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:02.183
UC RETIREMENT PROGRAM. UP FOR

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.219
THIS COMING YEAR WE'RE GOING TO

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:07.122
BE HAVING TO DISTRIBUTE OF FIVE

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:08.390
HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION FROM

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.692
OUR CORE OPERATING FUNDS INTO

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.193
OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM. THAT

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.828
REALLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:18.967
MONEY AVAILABLE OF FOR US TO

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.002

AT THE LEGISLATURE UP SINCE

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:24.439

BUDGET BY ONE POINT ONE BILLION

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:28.443
DOLLARS. AND SO IF WE HAVE TO

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.512
TAKE A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.546
MILLION INPUT INTO YOU SEPARATE

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:32.781
THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF THOSE

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.983
FUNDS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO US.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.152
GOING TO THIS PURPOSE THE ONLY

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.120

ONE POINT ONE BILLION SO WE'RE

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.801
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION HAD.

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:54.669
WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:55.303
EIGHT AND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.138
FIFTY NINE. MILLION DOLLARS

THE CONTRIBUTION SIDE AND THOSE

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.257
ARE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:18.426
RESTARTED IN TWENTY TEN. SO

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.794
WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

AND ALSO FOR THE AB NINETY FOUR

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.480
PROCESS THAT WE'RE USING TO

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:54.115
CONSTRUCT OUR BUILDINGS. THAT

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.783
DOES SET ASIDE EVERY YEAR JUST

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.385
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF OUR

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.987
OPERATING FUNDS THAT CAN THEN

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.722
BE USED FOR HIRING OF

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.023
INSTRUCTORS ARE STUDENT

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:07.195
SERVICES- SO. THE LEGISLATURE

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:08.363
HAS PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:15.169
WITH. A SERIES OF DIRECTIVES OF

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.806
REGARDING CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:20.642
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

NON RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.747
ENROLLMENT AND THE UNIVERSITY

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.815
HAS MET OR EXCEEDED EXCEEDED

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:29.450
ALL THOSE EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.386
ENROLLMENT AND STUDENT SERVICES

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.820
WITH MINIMAL INCREASES IN

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.722
SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AND FEES

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.758
OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS AND

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.026
DOING SO HOWEVER HAS PUT

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.861
PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:40.895
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A HIGH

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.564
QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ITS

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.432
GROWING STUDENT BODY AND WE

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.833
CAN'T CONTINUE TO RESTRICT

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.602
TUITION LVELS WITHOUT

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:50.138
SIGNIFICANT STATE INVESTMENT.

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:50.972
THE REGION'S HAVE BEEN

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.473
DISCUSSING AND ARE CONSIDERING

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.410
A VOTE ON MARCH NINETEENTH. ON

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:57.145
A NEW TUITION STABILIZATION

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:59.180
PLAN ONE OPTION BEING

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.949
CONSIDERED UNDER THIS PLAN IS A

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.951
COHORT BASED TUITION MODEL THIS

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:04.619
MODEL WOULD INCREASE FEES FOR

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.754
INCOMING STUDENTS ONLY. AND

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:09.090
MAINTAIN THOSE FEES STUDY FOR

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.992
SIX YEARS NO CURRENT STUDENTS

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.293
WOULD SEE A SYSTEM WIDE BE

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.995
INCREASE UNDER THE COHORT BASED

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.997
TUITION MODEL. THIS MODEL WILL

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.966
PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY TO UC

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.934
SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT CHARGES AND

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.703
ALLOW FAMILIES TO PLAN FOR THE

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:25.573
COST OF EDUCATION. ON SLIDE TEN

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.408
I DEMONSTRATE HOW WHEN THE

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:30.178
UNIVERSITY HAS COST INCREASES

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:32.313
ACROSS ALL FUNDING SOURCES. IT

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.948
DOES FUNDING SOURCES DON'T

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:35.883
INCREASE ONE FUNDING OURCE

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.286
MUST INCREASE BY MORE IF ALL

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:40.221
THE OTHERS THEN IF ALL THE

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.990
SOURCES HAD A SMALL INCREASE.

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:44.325
SO YOU'LL SEE HERE ON IN THIS

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:47.395
CHART. THERE ARE VARIOUS COR

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.330
FUNDS AND IF ALL OF THEM HAD A

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.633
SMALL INCREASE THE STATE

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:53.568
GENERAL FUND INCREASE WOULD BE

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.470
LESS THAN IF ONLY THE STATE

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:57.005
GENERAL FUND COMPONENT WAS

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.673
BEING ASKED TO COVER ALL OF

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.877
THE- INCREASE. FOR UP FOR THE

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.146
COST INCREASES SO WHAT'S THE

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.748
DOLLARS SO TO DO SO IF WE'VE

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.316
WAITED ALL IT WOULD BE 12%

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:12.854
INCREASE. OF INCREASED THE

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.921
STATE FUNDS ONLY IS THAT WHAT

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:16.658
THAT MEANS YES WELL IF SENT YES

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.826
IF THE IF ONLY'S THE STATE

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.962
FUNDS WERE COVERING ALL OF THE%

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:21.829
ALL OF THE NEEDS OF THE

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.698
UNIVERSITY AND WHAT'S THAT DO

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.533
WE KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS WHAT

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.368
WE'RE ASKING FOR FOUR HUNDRED

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.569
THIRTY THREE MILLION PRICE

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.103
COMING IS THAT WHY YOU'RE

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:31.205
ASKING FOR THAT. I MEAN I'M

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:31.973
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.008
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TWELVE PLUS

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:36.044
12% I MEAN IN TERMS OF DOLLARS

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:38.079
THAT IS NOT YOUR TOTAL ASK OR

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:39.781
IS THAT I THINK THAT'S JUST AN

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.949
ILLUSTRATIVE GRAPH THAT'S BEING

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.985
THAT'S SHOWS THE DIFFERENTIAL

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:46.421
BETWEEN THOSE THOSE PERCENTAGES

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:48.289
IF ONE SOURCE HAVE TO COVER ALL

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:51.292
OF IT VERSUS JUST LOW COMPONENT

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.528
GIVEN THAT NOT ALL OF THE MARS

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:56.597
EQUALLY SIZED 5% INCREASE TO OF

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:59.267
NONRESIDENTS OPTIMAL TUITION IS

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:03.271
LESS THAN A 5% INCREASE TO. OF

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.873
TO STATE FUNDS OR TUITION BUT

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.142
IN TERMS OF DOLLARS BUT WE YOU

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.010
KNOW I'M NOT A MATH PERSON

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.312
YOU'VE HAD TWO YEARS OF ME SO

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:12.613
I'M SURE YOU FIGURE THAT OUT

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.982
BUT IF NINETY FIVE MILLION

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.818
DOLLARS IS THE DELTA TO

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.720
MAINTAIN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.855
YOU BETWEEN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.657
PROPOSED AND WHAT YOU NEED IN

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:27.862
ORDER TO MAINTAIN. A FLAT LINE.

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.530
IS NINETY FIVE MILLION WHAT IT

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:30.965
WOULD TAKE TO AVOID A TUITION

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.235
INCREASE. OR IS THERE SOMETHING

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.203
MORE THAN THAT IS THAT A FAIR

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:37.171
QUESTION WHAT WE ALSO WANT TO

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.774
GROW OUR SERVICES SO WE HAVE A

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.109
WE HAVE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.511
PROPOSAL TO HIRE NEW FACULTY.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:47.381
AND TO- BRIDGE GRADUATION GAPS

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.016
SO WE AS A SYSTEM WANT TO NOT

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:51.786
JUST MEET OUR BASIC COST

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:55.456
INCREASES WE ALSO WANT TO. OF

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.793
PROVIDE ENHANCED SERVICES TO

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.928
OUR EXISTING STUDENTS. AND FOR

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:06.634
WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE. INCREASE

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.603
DISCUSSION AROUND HERE IS NOT

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.505
QUITE THE THIRD RAIL BUT IT

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:11.539
GETS THERE AND I'M JUST TRYING

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.574
TO FIGURE OUT IF MY COLLEAGUES

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.643
DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH A

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.211
TUITION INCREASE WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.113
THE OPTION THAT I SAY TO THEM

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:19.914
YOU DON'T LIKE A TUITION

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:22.884
INCREASE THEN WE NEED TWO

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.786
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.687
FUND YOU SEE HERE WE NEED

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:27.655
NINETY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.824
DOLLARS TO HELP FUND YOU SEE TO

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.025
AVOID A TUITION INCREASE AND

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.860
THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT ALL THESE

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.962
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU SEE WANTS

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.197
TO DO WE WANT TO ADD FACULTY.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.566
YOUR WE WANTED INCREASING

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:40.168
ENROLLMENT BY TWENTY FIVE

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.068
HUNDRED STUDENTS YOU WANT TO DO

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.537
THIS YOU WANT TO DO THAT EACH

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.172
OF THOSE LITTLE BUCKETS HAS A

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:46.073
PRICE TAG RIGHT AND YES LIKE

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.675
GOING TO MAKE DONALD I CAN GET

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:50.077
THE PICKLES THERE I CAN GET THE

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:52.947
DOUBLE BURGER OR THE TRIPLE

BOND OR WHATEVER AND BEACH BUST

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:55.883
I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.585
QUITE SO IT WOULD THE NINETY

01:30:57.652 --> 01:31:01.622
FIVE MIL. DEL PLUS ABOUT THE

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:05.893
MAIL. FOR TO IT. OF THE TO A

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.062
AND- WE WOULD GET FOR YEAR. TO

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.964
ADD MORE STUDENTS. SIXTY

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.432
MILLION THAT THAT WOULD TAKE

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:13.467
CARE OF DOUBLE K. TAKE CARE THE

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:14.902
COST IF WE ARE PLANNING ON

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.771
COVER HOPING TO COVER THAT WE

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:19.207
NEED TO COVER- IF YOU'RE

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:21.475
REQUESTING WE- I WAS TRYING TO

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:23.377
UNDERSTAND MY OPTIONS. THEY'RE

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:25.880
NOT MY OPTIONS BY THE WAY I.

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:26.981
CHECKED WITH NUMBERS OUT OF

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:29.317
THEIR DAY OUR EXPECTATION WOULD

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.185
BE TO GET THAT SIXTY MILLION

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:33.020
FROM ACCORD TUITION INCREASE-

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:36.324
IN THAT FIRST YEAR. SO WHAT YOU

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:38.559
DO AT THAT NUMBER. YOU KNOW AND

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.761
WE NEED THE NINETY FIVE MILLION

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:44.699
ON TOP OF THAT. SEWER OKAY OF.

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:47.001
UP FULL OF MY MATH BOOK AND TRY

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.971
TO GO TO WORK ON THAT. YEAH I

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.272
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.441
LOOKING AT WHAT BUT WE ARE

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:55.877
WE'RE REQUESTING THE FULL TWO

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:56.444
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.912
WILL CONTINUE TO REQUEST THAT

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.947
AND IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:03.751
BY NINE UNDERSTAND YEAH. SO ON

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.721
SLIDE ELEVEN- I DISCUSS A

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.289
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CORE HURT

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.157
BASED TUITION MODEL AT NEW

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.826
STUDENTS NEW STUDENTS WOULD SEE

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:12.827
AN INCREASE OF THEIR FEES IN

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.562
THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN THOSE

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:17.531
FROM PEACE WOULD REMAIN FLAT

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:20.201
FOR UP TO SIX YEARS- BUT FOR

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.702
THE POOREST STUDENTS ARE COVERT

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:24.872
BASED TUITION MODEL. OFFERS AN

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.173
INCREASE IN FINANCIAL AID.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.109
BECAUSE YOU SEE PUTS ASIDE ONE

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:29.410
THIRD OF OUR TUITION REVENUES

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:30.878
FINANCIAL AID FOR NEEDIEST

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:33.547
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS- AND CAL

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.515
GRANTS WHICH COVERED THE

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:36.851
TUITION INCREASE COMPONENT SO

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:37.852
THEY WOULD GET THE CAL GRANT

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.553
PLUS SOME INSTITUTIONAL

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.255
FINANCIAL AID. SO THEY WOULD

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.157
ACTUALLY BE SLIGHTLY BTTER OFF

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.526
THAN. IF THERE WAS NO TUITION

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:48.029
INCREASE AT ALL. AND CURRENTLY

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:51.432
OFF 57% OF OUR CALIFORNIA

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:54.035
RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES. DO NOT

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:56.804
PAY ANY TUITION UP BECAUSE IT'S

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.739
COVERED FOR THEM TO OUR

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:01.943
FINANCIAL AID MECHANISM AND

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:04.145
THEN TO SHIFT GEARS- FOR A

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:07.114
LITTLE MOMENT. THE UNIVERSITY

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.783
OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY AND

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:10.785
STUDENTS CONDUCT WORLD CLASS

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:13.154
RESEARCH WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.555
MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:18.993
PROPOSAL. OF TO HELP CONNECT

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:19.927
YOU SEE RESEARCH INNOVATION

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.630
WITH THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.298
DO THINK THAT THIS IS.

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.866
IMPORTANT WE HAVE FIVE

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:28.569
INNOVATIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY AS

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:31.772
A SYSTEM AND IF WE CAN HELP GET

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.274
THOSE INTO THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.409
ECONOMY WE CAN CREATE SOME REAL

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:38.612
GROSS AND REALLY- CONNECT OUR-

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:41.182
OF FACULTY YET AND OUR STUDENTS

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:45.619
WITH THE ECONOMY. IN TWENTY

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:46.220
SIXTEEN WE RECEIVED TWENTY TWO

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:48.222
MILLION. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.391
UTILIZE TO SUPPORT FOUR HUNDRED

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.959
AND FIFTY SIX STARTUP COMPANIES

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:55.062
WHICH COMBINED ATTRACTED TWO

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.330
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:57.765
MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE

01:33:57.832 --> 01:34:00.468
INVESTOR. UP FUNDS INTO

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:02.937
CALIFORNIA INTO THE START UPS

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.805
AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:07.108
TRAJECTORY BY REQUESTING TWENTY

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:08.142
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.977
NEXT YEAR TO CONTINUE THIS

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:11.712
PROGRAM WHICH HAS SHOWN A

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.748
TREMENDOUS RESULTS. AND THAT

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.783
CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION ON

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.752
OUR OPERATING BUDGET I'D LIKE

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.486
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.321
HAVE SIR. I DON'T KNOW THAT I

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.289
HAVE ANY BUT I APPRECIATE THE

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:22.890
FACT THAT YOU ALLOWED ME TO

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:24.925
INTERRUPT YOU ALL OVER THE

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:25.626
PLACE TO ASK HIM DURING YOUR

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:29.697
TASTE. AND IT'S A COMMON LA WHO

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:35.302
WANTS TO GO FOR. SO WE'LL JUST

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:37.204
DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.340
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:40.341
BIGGEST INVESTMENT WERE

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:42.476
PROPOSING FOR THE UC IS THE 5%

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:45.112
BASING CREASE WHICH WOULD TAKE

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:45.613
THEIR MAIN GENERAL FUND

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.581
APPROPRIATION. AND INCREASE IT

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.984
BY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.819
POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING.

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:52.520
THAT WOULD COME WITH THE

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:54.021
EXPECTATION THAT THE UC WOULD

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.057
CONTINUE WORKING TO IMPROVE

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:57.591
COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY TO

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:59.860
IMPROVE ACCESS. TO ADDRESS

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:02.797
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND TO

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:05.199
DECREASE TIME 2 DEGREES WELL

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.001
KNOWN ON ON THE TUITION PIECE

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:07.768
THAT AT THIS TIME THE

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:09.370
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T BELIEVE

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:10.171
A TUITION INCREASE WOULD BE

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.106
WARRANTED GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:14.241
PROPOSAL AND GOVERNOR'S BUGET

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:16.844
OF HUNDREDS SIXTY NINE AND A

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.779
TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.882
THREE. ON GOING. AT TWO

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:24.452
SEVENTEEN ONGOING. AT AND LAST

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:27.254
YEAR WE THE TWENTY NINETEEN

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:28.989
BUDGET THE STATE INVESTED MORE

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.658
THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:31.659
EIGHT MILLION ONGOING GENERAL

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:33.227
FUND. THOSE ARE BOTH

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.462
HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.697
INVESTMENTS- PERMANENT FUNDING

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:39.033
IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND SO-

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.001
RAISING TUITION BE- IN

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:42.536
ADVISABLE IN BED FOR STUDENTS

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:44.405
AT THIS TIME. AND I UNDERSTAND

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:45.539
BOTH THE POLITICS AND I'M

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:46.841
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:51.011
FINANCE PIECE OF ALL THIS. DOES

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:53.314
IS PROBABLY SOME SCIENCE TO

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.549
THIS SIZE SOON AS OPPOSED TO

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:58.686
JUST ARE IN TERMS OF. AN

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:02.156
INCREASE IN COSTS. NO CARS COST

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:03.958
MORE TODAY PIANOS COST MORE

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:08.028
TODAY. LIFE COSTS MORE TODAY

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:09.230
AND THERE'S AN INCREASE IN COST

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:13.234
AND NOT BEING A MATH PERSON.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.369
THAT TRANSLATES INTO SOMETHING

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.873
AT THE BOTTOM LINE AND- CAN YOU

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:21.308
RESPOND TO THE TO THE DELTA

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.544
ISSUE THE NINETY FIVE WHATEVER

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.879
IT WAS NINETY FIVE POINT ONE OR

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:27.314
WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS MILLION

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:30.317
DOLLAR DELTA BETWEEN. WHERE

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.253
THEY ARE AND WHERE YOU SEE

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.655
CLAIMS TO NEED TO BE IN ORDER

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.590
TO MAINTAIN SORT OF A FLAT LINE

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.125
APPROACH TO WHAT TO THE

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.994
DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES THAT

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:44.131
YOU SEE PROVIDES. AND THEN MY

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:45.866
PERHAPS IN ARTFUL QUESTIONS

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:47.301
HAVING TO DO WITH THE TUITION

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.937
INCREASE AND WHAT WOULD WE HAVE

01:36:50.004 --> 01:36:51.906
TO DO IN ORDER TO AVOID A

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.741
TUITION INCREASE IF IN FACT THE

01:36:53.807 --> 01:36:55.242
INCREASES RESPONDING TO

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:57.077
INCREASE COSTS DOES ANY THAT

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:59.513
MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.448
QUESTION SAY NO BUT THAT THAT

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.350
MAY IT'S A 100% SENSE. I THINK

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:06.487
IT. HI WHERE WE GET OUR

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.322
PERSPECTIVE FROM SO FOR.

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:09.523
THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT WHEN

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:10.991
WE CHARACTERIZE WHAT THE UC'S

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.359
NEEDS ARE WE'RE NOT THINKING US

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.494
THIS EARLY IN THE SAME TERMS

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.530
THE UC ARE SO. FOR ONE- WHEN

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:19.099
YOU LOOK AT ON PAGE FOR THE

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:21.602
UC'S CORE FUNDS- THE STATE

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.737
GENERAL FUND PORTION IS LISTED

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:26.040
AS 42% AND THEN THERE'S THE

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:28.075
ORANGE THAT INDICATES TUITION.

01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:29.276
BUT THE STATE FUNDS A

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.345
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THAT-

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:32.880
STUDENT TUITION PEACE THROUGH

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:34.782
CAL GRANT AND SO THE STATE'S.

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.317
CONTRIBUTION HERE TO OVERALL

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:38.185
CORE FUNDING IS MORE THAN FIFTY

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:41.388
PERCENT. AND SO. OUR STARTING

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.489
POINT FOR THINKING ABOUT THE

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:44.425
UC'S BUDGET IS TYPICALLY A

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:46.360
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. WE ALSO

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:47.995
KNOW THIRD THERE'S NOT ALWAYS

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.230
IN AGREEMENT ON WHAT THE

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:52.166
MANDATORY COSTS ARE- AND THAT

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.368
IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. THE

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:57.871
UC IS REQUESTING FORTY MILLION

01:37:57.938 --> 01:37:59.106
FOR INCREASED YOU SEE OUR P.

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.809
PENSION PAYMENTS. BUT TWENTY

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:02.843
MILLION OF THAT REFLECTS A

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.979
RECENT DECISION MADE BY THE

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:08.148
REGENTS TO- GO FOR MORE

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:10.017
CONSERVATIVE ACTUARIAL.

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:12.019
CALCULATIONS IN TERMS OF RETURN

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:14.555
ON INVESTMENT. AND SO THE

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.090
CONSERVATIVE NUMBER THAT THEY

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:18.826
CHOSE AS AS- IS UNDER WHERE CAL

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.361
STIRS IN CALPERS ARE AT IN

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:21.295
TERMS OF WHAT THEY EXPECT TO

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.997
RETURN TO BE WE'LL SEE WHAT

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.331
HAPPENS AFTER YEAH MARKET OF

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:26.634
THE LESS YEAH COUPLE WEEKS. IT

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.402
AND SO IT BUT IN THE LONG TERM

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:30.537
THEY HAVE SET THEMSELVES UP TO.

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.573
CREATE MORE NEED TO DUMP MONEY

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.341
INTO COVER THAT OUTSTANDING

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.243
PENSION LIABILITY AND SO IN

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:37.311
TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THAT AS

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:39.079
A MANDATORY COST IT'S DEBATABLE

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.614
AND OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:42.049
THAT MAYBE TWENTY MILLION AS

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:44.151
MORE LEGITIMATE THAN THETWENTY

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:45.619
THAT REFLECTS A RECENT.

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:46.453
DECISION THAT DOESN'T

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.855
NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH WHERE

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:50.224
THE STATE'S OTHER LARGE.

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:53.093
PENSION COMMITMENTS ARE. AND

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.561
I'VE I PLEDGE TO SIT DOWN WITH

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:56.196
PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH MORE THAN I

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:58.799
AM INSIDE TO FIGURE OUT MY MATH

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:00.434
BECAUSE I CAN'T DO IT IN PUBLIC

01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:02.303
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THE

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:03.470
THAT THE DELTA WE'RE TALKING

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:04.905
ABOUT IS ABOUT NINETY FIVE

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:05.973
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SIXTY

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.408
MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:09.043
COURT COVER SOME OTHER PROGRAMS

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:10.477
I REALIZE YOU WANT SIXTY MORE

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:12.613
BUT IT'S GOING TO COVER SOME

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.781
OTHER PROGRAMS THE THREE THAT

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:15.249
WERE LISTED SOMEWHERE IN HERE

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:17.184
THAT I JUST. SPOTTED IN WILL

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:19.086
HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:21.455
ABOUT. WHETHER NINETY FIVE

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.924
MILLION DOLLARS- OBVIATES THE

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.826
NEED FOR OF. STUDENT TUITION

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.728
INCREASE OTHER THAN THE FACT

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:28.662
THAT YOU SEE HAS SOME.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:29.830
ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT THEY

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:33.567
WANT TO PUT FORWARD BUT I WOULD

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.903
LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL TO.

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:38.739
IF YOU CAN. IF YOU CAN IMPROVE

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:39.973
THE BRAIN WAVES OF US

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.209
SEPTUAGENARIAN I'M GOING TO

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:46.347
CHALLENGE YOU ON THAT POINT LA.

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:47.014
SO YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.215
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES I DON'T

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.917
WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT TOO

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:53.287
MUCH ON WHAT MY BRAIN. BUT YOU

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:54.755
KNOW THIS THIS ITEM REALLY HAS

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:56.790
TO KEY. ISSUES THAT ARE

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.125
PERENNIAL THE LEGISLATURE FACES

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.960
AND EVERY YEAR THEY ARE ONE OF

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:00.994
THE COST INCREASES YOU LIKE TO

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.796
SUPPORT YOU SEE AND- HOW TO

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:03.697
THOSE COVERED BE COVERED

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:05.599
BETWEEN GENERAL FUND

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:06.100
AUGMENTATIONS IN TUITION

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.568
INCREASES. ON THE

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:08.502
ADMINISTRATION THIS YEAR'S

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.170
PROPOSING UP A SORT OF BASING

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:13.207
CREASE THAT- IS UNRESTRICTED-

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:14.108
IT IS GIVING YOU SEE THE

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.676
FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHAT COST

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.244
INCREASE IS TO SUPPORT WITHIN

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.545
THAT AUGMENTATION. AND IT IS

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:19.747
ENTIRELY COVERING THAT FROM THE

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:22.049
GENERAL FUND- AND- TUITION

01:40:22.116 --> 01:40:23.350
INCREASE SO THINKING ABOUT

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:24.251
THESE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES YOU

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:25.285
DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.353
THINKING ABOUT WHAT COST

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.521
INCREASES TO SUPPORT. WE DO

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:28.322
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:29.757
GOVERNOR'S FOR ALL APPROACH

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:30.858
FIGHTING AN UNRESTRICTED BASED

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.226
INCREASE. ON BECAUSE IT

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:35.329
DOESN'T- ISN'T CONNECTED TO-

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.063
AYE CALCULATIONS OF COST

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.698
INCREASES IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:38.198
WHICH PRIORITIES IT'S

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:39.733
SPECIFICALLY FUNDING IT GIVES A

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.102
LEGISLATURE. AWESOME DIFFICULTY

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:43.737
UNDERSTANDING WHAT EXACTLY IT'S

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.406
BEING OUT TO SUPPORT IN THE

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.408
BUDGET YEAR- BUT AS YOU. CAN BE

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:48.642
DIFFICULT TO TRACK AGAINST THE

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.210
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON WHAT YOU

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:52.880
SEE IS- PROPOSING SO WE

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:54.148
RECOMMEND TYING INCREASES MORE

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:55.816
SPECIFICALLY TO PRIORITIES THAT

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.418
YOU HAVE A- BUDGET. WE ALSO

01:40:57.484 --> 01:41:02.156
NOTE AT THE NINETEEN TWENTY

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.557
BUDGET TOOK THIS EXPECT

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.293
ACTUALLY APPROACH THAT WE'RE-

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.364
PUTTING IT HI. EVERY OUR

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:11.532
PATIENTS SEVEN PRIORITIES

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:13.333
PROVIDED CLEAR SAID WASN'T THE

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.137
STATE'S EXPECTATIONS WERE

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:17.771
REGARDING ITS AUGMENTATIONS. SO

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:18.705
NOW THAT'S- EASY THING IS A

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:19.606
MORE COUPLE QUESTION AS WELL.

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:20.674
OKAY WE SHOULD IDENTIFY

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:21.308
PRIORITIES BUT WHAT YOUR

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:22.676
PRIORITIES BEING MUCH OF THAT

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.244
AMOUNT BE THAT'S WHAT YOURS ARE

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:25.512
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW.

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.247
THERE WE THINK THERE ARE TWO

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:28.715
WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT THERE TO

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:29.683
KIND OF CATEGORIES OF INCREASES

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:31.051
THERE ARE. WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:33.220
BASIC OPERATIONAL INCREASES TO

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:34.488
MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICES AND

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.256
TO BE. TOLERANT CREASES BENEFIT

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.158
INCREASES OPERATING EXPENSES

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:38.859
AND THEN YOU HAVE A SEPARATE

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.060
CATEGORY OF INCREASES THAT

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.061
WOULD BE MORE PROGRAMMATIC IN

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.629
NATURE. THINGS LIKE EXPANDING

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:43.997
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR OTHER

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.766
PROGRAMS THAT YOU UNIVERSITY

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.701
ABOUT A FIGHT IN ITS-

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.403
PRESENTATION. AND WE THINK YOU

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.471
YOU WANT TO WEIGH BOTH OF THOSE

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:51.972
AND YOU MAYBE WANNA START WITH

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:53.340
OPERATIONAL COST INCREASES.

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:54.775
THINK ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE COST

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.977
YOU LIKE TO SUPPORT WHAT LEVEL

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:57.411
AND THEN MOVE ON TO

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.213
PROGRAMMATIC. IN TERMS OF

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:00.380
THINKING ABOUT THIS SORT OF

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.783
MANDATORY FOR THE UNIVERSITY.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.585
MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION THE

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.687
UNIVERSITY HAS A LOTS OF FLEX.

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:07.621
TO MANAGE COSTS ACROSS ITS

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.356
BUDGET AND MANAGE IS IT SIMPLY

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.658
BENEFIT PROGRAMS IT DETERMINES

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.060
WHAT SALARIES OF LIKE TO

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:15.329
PROVIDE. IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE

01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:16.797
MOST USEFUL OFF. ABOUT IT CAN

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.065
BE MORE FOR JUST THINK ABOUT

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.166
WHAT ARE THE COST INCREASES OF

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:21.535
THESE PROGRAMS ABSENT A POLICY

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:23.370
CHANGE. AND WHAT IS RIGHT AND

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:32.145
WHAT. PURCELL BRING IS. WE JUST

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:32.846
OF THE RIVERS ARE BASIC

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.448
OPERATIONAL COST INCREASE SO WE

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:36.250
ASSUME 3% SALARY INCREASES WE

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:38.519
ASSUMED. COST INCREASES TO

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:39.253
BENEFITS AND WE ASSUMED

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.088
OPERATING EXPENSES IT INCREASES

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.990
WE ALSO NOTED OUT SOME SAVINGS

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.191
THE UNIVERSITY ANTICIPATES IT

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:45.592
WILL ON HER. OFF FROM THINGS

01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:47.027
LIKE I'M GETTING HIGHER

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.595
INVESTMENT INVESTMENT RETURNS

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.030
FOR EXAMPLE. IMPROVE BURKE

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:52.199
PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. AND WHAT

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:53.901
WE ESTIMATED THAT BUDGET WHICH

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:55.035
IS A LARGE TREE OF LEGISLATURE

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:55.969
DOESN'T HAVE TO GO WITH THAT

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.371
THEIR MANY OPTIONS FOR IT BUT

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:58.605
THAT. THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE

01:42:58.672 --> 01:42:59.673
BUDGET COST ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:00.240
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:01.642
IS. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:04.611
WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS. PROPOSING

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:05.946
IN HIS BUDGET. SO THAT'S JUST

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.047
OR THE FIRST SET OF ISSUES TO

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:07.881
CONSIDER THE SECOND SET OF

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:08.849
ISSUES IS NOW OKAY WE'VE

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.484
DECIDED THE COST INCREASES.

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:11.785
SHOULD BE THROUGH THE GENERAL

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:13.487
FUND OR TUITION INCREASE. AND

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:14.655
YOU'VE ACTUALLY HEARD A LOT OF

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:15.656
THE FACTORS THAT YOU'D WANT TO

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.424
WAY THERE. I'M WE THINK THEY'RE

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:17.925
BASICALLY ARE THREE KEY

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.826
FACTORS. THE FIRST WHICH THE

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:20.961
ADMINISTRATION ALLUDED TO WAS

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.362
THINKING ABOUT THE SHARE OF

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:23.330
COSTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:26.133
STUDENTS- ABOUT HALF OF STILL

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:27.200
HALF OF UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:29.536
STUDENTS CURRENTLY- DON'T PAY

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:30.871
TUITION THEY HAVE THAT COVERED

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.406
THROUGH FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS.

01:43:32.472 --> 01:43:33.874
THE OTHER HALF FOR OUR MOST

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:35.108
MOST OFTEN IS THE CASE THEIR

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.443
FULL PAY STUDENTS SOME OF THEM

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:37.778
GET UP. SOME AID THROUGH THE

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:38.412
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BUT BY

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:40.247
AND LARGE THERE- GENERALLY FULL

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.315
PAY STUDENTS THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:42.382
PAYING ABOUT HALF OF THEIR

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.417
COSTS AND SO THE QUESTION

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.818
BEFOREYOU IS. DISPATCHER SEEM

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:47.054
REASONABLE AS A TO HIRE IS IT

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.655
TOO LOW. THE SECOND FACTOR YOU

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:49.423
COULD CONSIDER IS

01:43:49.489 --> 01:43:51.124
AFFORDABILITY. THIS SEEMS TO

01:43:51.191 --> 01:43:53.293
BE- ARE CONCERNED- THAT WE'VE

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.461
HEARD FROM BOTH THE UNIVERSITY

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:56.730
AND THE ADMINISTRATION- AS

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:58.732
UNIVERSITY AND- ALLUDED TO-

01:43:58.799 --> 01:43:59.766
IT'S A BIT OF A COMPLICATED

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:01.301
DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.636
INCREASE TUITION. PROVIDES MORE

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:03.837
AID FOR LIVING COSTS FOR

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:05.505
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. SO

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:06.807
TUITION INCREASE ACTUALLY HAS

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:07.574
THE COUNTER TO WOULD HAVE

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:08.342
EFFECTIVE IMPROVING

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:09.710
AFFORDABILITY FOR FINANCIALLY

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.144
NEEDY STUDENTS. IT INCREASED

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:12.479
COSTS FOR STUDENTS WHO AREN'T

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:13.614
ON FINANCIALLY RIGHT GETTING

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.549
FULL TUITION. A COVERAGE SO.

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.450
THERE'S A THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:18.218
ON WHO'S PAYING FOR THAT

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:22.022
TUITION INCREASE. AND THEN- WE

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.223
ON THE THIRD POINT I'M SORRY

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.726
HAD A- MENTAL- SITUATION THERE

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.594
SO THAT'S THE THIRD POINT- IS

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:30.631
TO THINK ABOUT. I'M YOU KNOW

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.698
YOUR CAPACITY WHAT YOUR PRIOR

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.133
IS ARE YOUR YOUR CAPACITOR FROM

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.601
THOSE OF THE GENERAL FUND WHEN

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.136
YOU ADOPTED TUITION INCREASE

01:44:36.203 --> 01:44:37.771
SAID IT PROVIDES FUNDING TO THE

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.373
UNIVERSITY AT A POTENTIALLY

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:41.041
LOWER COST TO THE GENERAL FUND.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.542
ALMOND SO THAT FREES UP MORE-

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:43.810
CAPACITY TO FUND ADDITIONAL

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:45.345
PRIORITIES YOU HAVE I JUST

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.780
ILLUSTRATE THAT POINT IN THEIR

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:47.514
IN OUR LIST OF THE BUDGET

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:50.384
EXAMPLE A 3% TUITION INCREASE

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.486
WOULD REDUCE GENERAL FUND COSTS

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.354
OF. A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.389
MILLION SO BELOW THE GOVERNOR'S

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:56.823
BUDGET BUT PROVIDE EFFECTIVELY

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:59.092
MORE FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:44:59.159 --> 01:44:59.726
TO COVER A LOT OF ITS OPERATING

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.361
COSTS. I'M SO THOSE ARE JUST

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:02.896
SOME FACTORS TO CONSIDER. AND

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:04.164
THEN- A FINAL THING TO CONSIDER

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:04.998
THAT SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT THIS

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:06.266
YEAR'S UNIVERSITY IS

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:09.036
CONSIDERING A LONG TERM POLICY-

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:09.836
DID HAVE A GUY TUITION

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.638
INCREASES IN THERE THE-

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:13.840
OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE HERE SEEMS

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:14.808
TO BE TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE

01:45:14.875 --> 01:45:16.677
MORE. PREDICTABILITY FOR THEIR

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:18.412
TUITION INCREASES OTHERS A

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:19.680
FIGURE AN AGENDA THAT SHOWS

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:20.981
THAT IT'S BEEN IT GETS QUITE

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:22.449
FALL TILE AND SOME YEARS IT'S

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:23.383
FLAT NO THREE YEARS THEIR NOBLE

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:24.551
HIKES. SO THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:25.519
ADDRESS THIS BY HAVING A

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.320
TUITION POLICY AND THEY'RE TWO

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:27.821
DIFFERENT OPTIONS THERE

01:45:27.888 --> 01:45:29.856
CONSIDERING. ON WE THINK IT'S

01:45:29.923 --> 01:45:30.857
WORTHWHILE TO MAYBE REVIEW

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:32.225
THOSE POLICY SEE IF THEY ALIGN

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.860
WITH YOUR EXPECTATIONS. AND IF

01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:35.595
THOSE POLICIES ARE ADOPTED TO

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:36.930
WAIT TO FACTOR THOSE ADDITIONAL

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.633
REVENUES IN YOUR FINAL BUDGET

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.500
DECISIONS. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:42.469
THAT'S WHAT I'M I'M GRAPPLING

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:43.437
TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS AND

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:45.872
I THINK WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:46.673
TO DO THAT AND CERTAINLY I

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.075
WILL. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S AN

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.943
INCREASE IN COST MAKING SURE

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:52.779
THAT THE STATE'S. APPROPRIATION

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:55.716
IN THE BUDGET INCREASES THE-

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.684
MEETS THE INCREASE IN COST TO

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.686
THE BUT THE BASIC UP UNIVERSITY

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:02.422
OPERATION. AND THEN WHEN

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:04.591
THEY'RE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS-

01:46:04.658 --> 01:46:06.793
EITHER THAT WE WANT TO SEE. PUT

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.095
FORWARD OR THAT THE UNIVERSITY

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:12.165
PROPOSES HOW THOSE PROGRAMS

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:13.667
NEED TO BE PAID FOR AND SHOULD

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:15.769
ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL COST OF A

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.137
PARTICULAR PROGRAM BE COVERED

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:19.272
OF THE GENERAL FUND BY THE

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:20.974
STATE OR IS THERE SOME

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:22.342
PROPORTIONATE SHARE THAT WE

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:24.111
THINK YOU KNOW US STUDENTS

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:26.279
THROUGH TUITION. SHOULD

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:28.014
CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRAMS

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:30.450
STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE- COME

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:32.018
FORWARD AND HAVE A VARIETY OF

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:34.054
PROGRAMS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE-

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:36.156
AT THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND YOU

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:38.725
SEE IN GENERAL- AND THEN THE

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:40.160
QUESTION IS WHO PAYS FOR THOSE

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:42.362
<u>DDITIONAL PROGRAMS THIS SHOULD</u>

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:43.530
BE PART OF THE STUDENT TUITION

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:45.565
PACKAGE HOWEVER IT'S CONFIGURED

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.033
WHETHER IT'S A COHORT PACKAGER.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.869
AN INFLATION ADJUSTED ON AN

01:46:48.935 --> 01:46:50.704
ANNUAL BASIS TUITION PACKAGE

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:52.038
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.807
THAT OUT BUT IT WOULD BE YOU

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:54.541
KNOW I'M TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:56.042
THE BASIC COST IS WHAT THE COST

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.612
INCREASES GOV AND I UNDERSTAND

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.814
YOUR POINT. SIR WHICH IS WE

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:02.015
HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS AS TO

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:03.784
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT COST

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:04.951
PACKAGE AND WHAT THOSE NUMBERS

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:06.920
ARE. AND THEN WHO SHOULD BE

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.622
PAYING FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO.

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:10.390
HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:11.024
AGREEMENT THERE AND THEN FIGURE

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:13.794
THIS. THIS OUT ANY ANY

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.428
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MEMBER FOR

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:18.732
I TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE. OF I

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:21.301
THINK I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE-

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.703
THE UNIVERSITY HAS MULTIPLE

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.505
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES WE

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:26.473
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.041
PHILANTHROPY COMING IN WE HAVE

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:29.176
A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL NON

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:31.244
RESIDENTS OF PROMOTE TUITION SO

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.146
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW COST.

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:35.715
THAT WE ARE NOW PLANNING FOR IN

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.417
THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR BUT NOT

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:39.519
ALL OF THEM ARE COMING FROM THE

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.655
STATE SO EVEN THE FOUR HUNDRED

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:42.355
THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.391
THAT I DRESSED EARLIER IS NOT

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.927
ENTIRELY- IS NOT OUR FULL COST

01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:50.230
INCREASES FOR. US NEXT YEAR ARE

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:52.632
WE HAVE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:55.168
AMOUNT OF THESE MANDATORY COST

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.636
INCREASES THAT INCLUDE STAFF

01:47:56.703 --> 01:48:00.841
SALARIES THAT INCLUDE. OF TWO

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:01.708
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNFUNDED

UNDERGRADUATES FROM THE PRIOR

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:07.280
YEAR. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF. LOT

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:09.015
OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND WE

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:12.519
WANT TO RETAIN FLEXIBILITY IN

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:15.589
THE- THIS BUDGET INCREASE OF WE

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:16.523
RECEIVED TO PROVIDE THE

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.024
CHANCELLOR'S WITH THE ABILITY

IDENTIFYING IS MANDATORY COST

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:07.167
TO KIND OF SUSTAIN THEIR CORE

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:09.135
OPERATIONS HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:10.737

ASPECTS IN MY COLLEAGUES SPOKE

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.679
TO ABOUT HALF OF THE UC OUR P.

REQUEST FROM. YOU SEE THAT'S A

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.483
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.452

PROPOSED THE TWENTY TWENTY.

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:14.067
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET UC HAS BEEN

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:15.635
ABLE TO MAINTAIN TUITION FLAT.

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:16.870
BELIEVE IT'S AND SEVEN OF THE

01:51:16.936 --> 01:51:18.405
PAST EIGHT YEARS. AS MY

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:20.306

TUITION INCREASES WARRANTED AND

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.844
SEE IT AS KIND OF BAD FOR

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.813
STUDENTS. TIME AT ALL AND WE

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.248
ALSO THEN CAN HAVE A

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:29.783

AND THEN OF THOSE ARE FUNDED

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:37.757
AND WHETHER THOSE DESERVE. I

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:38.825
GUESS THEY ALL DESERVE PROGRAMS

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:40.493
BUT WHETHER WE CAN FIND SOME OF

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.795
THOSE OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:43.396
OR WHETHER SOME OF THOSE. NEED

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.565
TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE TUITION

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:47.901
INCREASES. CORRECT AND THE

01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:48.968
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES MAKE

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.904

THAT THEY CAN MAKE. SOME

01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:08.421
DETERMINATION OF. WHERE THAT

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:10.557
SPENDING IS MOST AREN'T DEAD

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:34.754
KNOW CRITICISM I JUST I MEAN I

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:37.357
GUESS IT'S OF. NO ON ONCE IN

01:56:37.423 --> 01:56:38.358
ONE SENSE IT'S A GOOD PROBLEM

01:56:38.424 --> 01:56:40.927
TO HAVE IN THE OTHER SENSE IT'S

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:41.828
A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:44.030
SOLVE. OF WHERE WE ARE FINDING

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:45.531
THAT MORE MORE CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:56:45.598 --> 01:56:46.766
SCHOOLERS ARE BECOMING A

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.334
THROUGH G. PREPARED WHICH IS A

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.403
GREAT THING THERE ARE PREPARED

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:53.406
FOR TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:56.008
INSTITUTION BUT- THAT THAT

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:59.379
DEMAND HAS DEFINITELY STARK

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:00.947
APOSTASY AND IN ORDER TO

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:02.215
CONTINUE TO INSTRUCT THEM WE

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:05.118
NEED- WE NEED A LOT OF MONEY TO

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:09.589
HIRE INSTRUCTORS. SO MOVING ON

01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:11.624
TO SLIDE FIFTEEN AND THIS

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:12.492
ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON SOME OF

01:57:12.558 --> 01:57:14.694
THESE PROBLEMS IF YOU SEE MAKES

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:16.129
ENROLLMENT DECISIONS IN EARLY

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:18.831
MARCH SO WE'VE NOW SENT OUT

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:21.200
LETTERS. TO HIGH SCHOOLERS

01:57:21.267 --> 01:57:22.802
SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:24.704
ADMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.406
WHAT THIS IS WELL BEFORE THE

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:28.474
LEGISLATURE MAKES A DECISION ON

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.009
HE ENROLLMENT LEVEL THAT YOU

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:31.811
WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE. FOR THE

01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:33.846
NEXT YEAR SO WE'RE WE'RE AHEAD

01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:35.581
OF THESE DECISIONS AND THAT

01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:37.049
MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.751
THE CAMPUSES TO ENROLL THE

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:39.819
NUMBER STUDENTS THAT THE

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:41.187
LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO

01:57:41.254 --> 01:57:45.858
SUPPORT. AND SLIDE. ABOUT

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:46.926
FIFTEEN SHOWS THE NUMBER OF

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.428
UNFUNDED STUDENTS THAT THE

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.029
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:52.265
AS AND ROLLED SINCE TWENTY

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:55.067
FIFTEEN WHICH WE ARE VERY HAPPY

01:57:55.134 --> 01:57:56.803
THAT WE HAD THIS BIG SURGING

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:58.004
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:00.173
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT- BUT

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.108
OVER FIVE THOUSAND THREE

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:03.209
HUNDRED OF THOSE STUDENTS. BOB

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:04.844
HAD NO MARGINAL COST OF

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.913
INSTRUCTION COMING FROM THE

01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:09.182
STATE SO THAT PLACES OF A HUGE

01:58:09.248 --> 01:58:10.716
BURDEN ON THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:12.418
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE

01:58:12.485 --> 01:58:13.986
THE INSTRUCTORS FOR THEM SO

01:58:14.053 --> 01:58:15.254
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:17.156
OTHER MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:18.524
ALSO WE'RE SEEING SOME EARLY

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:21.461
INDICATORS THAT OCT QUALITY

01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:22.628
STUDENTS ARE LESS HAPPY WITH

01:58:22.695 --> 01:58:24.397
THE QUALITY WE'RE SEEING MORE

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:26.265
STUDENTS RESPONDING THAT THEY

01:58:26.332 --> 01:58:27.700
IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY KNEW NO

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.235
NOW THEY MIGHT NOT A ROLL OF

01:58:29.302 --> 01:58:31.871
THE UC. AND WE'VE HAD 13% OF

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:34.240
OUR STUDENTS A REPORT THAT THEY

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:35.441
WERE UNABLE TO GET INTO THE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:37.143
MAJOR OF THEIR FIRST CHOICE

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:38.911
THAT'S A LARGE NUMBER AND

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:42.548
THAT'S UP FROM ABOUT 3% BACK IN

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:46.018
A TWO THOUSAND THREE. YEAH THIS

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.954
THIS UNFUNDED. ENROLLMENT

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:48.921
GROWTH IS THAT THAT'S A

01:58:48.988 --> 01:58:50.690
FUNCTION I GATHER OF OUR BUDGET

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:54.560
PROCESS OF WE BELIEVE SO WE-

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:55.962
RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM THE

01:58:56.028 --> 01:58:57.530
LEGISLATURE FOR TWO OF THOSE

01:58:57.597 --> 01:58:58.564
YEARS WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:02.068
TO- IN ROLE AT LEAST. FIVE

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:04.136
THOUSAND STUDENTS AND AT LEAST

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:04.670
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.072
STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE OR WE

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:08.207
WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY MONEY FOR

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:09.842
ANY OF THOSE STUDENTS. AND

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:11.177
BECAUSE WE WERE UNDER THAT

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:14.146
PRESSURE WE WENT AND WE OF MADE

01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:17.216
MORE OFFERS. THEN REALLY WE

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:19.585
GAPS NEEDED TO US AND WE- OVER

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:24.357
AND ROLLED. OF AND THEN. OF WE

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:27.193
WERE FACING SOME SOME PRESSURE

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.028
ON THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:30.630
WANT TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:32.098
AND THE WAY THOSE OFFERS ARE

01:59:32.164 --> 01:59:33.733
BEING MADE DOESN'T DOESN'T

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:36.235
MATCH THE US STATE PROCESS I

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:36.903
THINK THE STATE PROCESS IS

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:39.171
PROBABLY. A SIGNIFICANT

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:41.774
COMPONENT OF IT MAYBE 80% YOU

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:42.675
KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE US AN

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:44.277
INDICATOR THAT YOU WANT US TO

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:46.479
AND ROLL NEW STUDENTS OR THE

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:48.147
REGION'S TELL US TO GO FORTH

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:49.549
AND ENROLL STUDENTS BECAUSE

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:51.250
THEY WANT TO GROW CAPACITY THE

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:52.852
CAMPUS IS THAN COMPLY WITH THAT

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:55.688
REGION TOLL REQUEST BUT THEN

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:57.056
THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS DOESN'T

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.324
GIVE US THE- AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:00.192
THAT WE THOUGHT WE WANTED BUT I

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:03.029
MEAN IF IT'S OUR- ISSUE. IT

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:05.565
SHOULD BE. THE FIVE OR SIX OR

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:07.233
SEVEN YEAR PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.635
GO AWAY IF WE UNLESS WE JUST

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:11.704
CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED PROBLEM

02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:14.106
ME. WHAT IS A MAIN YOU ENROLL A

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:16.108
CLASS AND- YOU MAY NOT BE

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:17.843
FUNDED FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND

02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:19.845
YOU TAKE IN TWO THOUSAND MORE

02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:21.781
BUT I ASSUME THEN YOU'RE NOT

02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:22.982
FUNDED FOR THE SECOND YEAR THE

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:24.450
THIRD YEAR THE FOURTH YEAR THE

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:26.485
FIFTH I MEAN. DON'T WE FIX THIS

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:29.555
AT SOME POINT OR WE JUST ASSUME.

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:32.124
WE HAVE NOT BEEN FIXING IT-

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:34.026
THAT'S THE WAY IT USED TO WORK

02:00:34.093 --> 02:00:36.529
BACK IN LIKE TWO THOUSAND.

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:38.464
WHERE ONCE WE HAD AND ROLLED.

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:39.966
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LOOK THE

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:41.200
NEXT YEAR AND SAY HOW MUCH DID

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:43.469
YOU GO OVER THE AMOUNT AND THEN

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:44.870
THEY WOULD JUST SIR TOP THE

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.572
UNIVERSITY OFF. THAT DOESN'T

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.241
HAPPEN ANYMORE- BUT THE METHOD

02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:52.011
OF PRE FUNDING WOULD HELP US.

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:54.680
GET TO A- GET TO A SOLUTION ON

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.515
THAT TO A GOOD LONG WAY. WHERE

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:57.917
YOU WOULD GIVE US THE MONEY NOW

02:00:57.984 --> 02:00:59.418
AND INDICATE NOW HOW MANY

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:00.386
STUDENTS YOU WANT US TO AND

02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:03.389
ROLE. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:04.991
ONE. AND THEN AND WE'RE

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:06.392
REQUESTING TWENTY TWO POINT

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:09.695
FIVE MILLION FOR THAT AND THEN

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:10.896
AS WE'RE MAKING IN ROMAN

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:12.465
DECISIONS AND RECRUITMENT AND

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.133
PLANNING ALL THROUGH THE YEAR

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.769
WE CAN HIRE THE FACULTY AND

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:19.305
THAT HAVE THE CLASS START. I

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:21.307
THINK MY COLLEAGUES OVER HERE

02:01:21.374 --> 02:01:23.376
WANT TO JUMP IN. DID SOMEONE

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:24.844
ADDRESS I MEAN WHY DON'T WE TOP

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:27.913
IT OFF IF WE SAY IF IT'S US AND

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.283
WE SAY. THE LACSON YEAH I THINK

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:32.585
THIS GOES BACK TO ITS ON THE

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:34.086
WERE TALKING WHEN THE LAST ITEM

02:01:34.153 --> 02:01:35.087
IS JUST HELPFUL PERSPECTIVE

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:38.758
HERE THAT. THAT ERA FROM TWENTY

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:39.959
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN

02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:41.560
SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW THE SAME

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:42.895
APPROACH THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:43.863
WITH THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:46.132
TAKEN. WERE A FLEXIBLE BASED

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:48.100
AUGMENTATION. ON THE GENERAL

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.669
FUND APPROPRIATION WAS OFFERED

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:51.237
BY THE STATE. AND SO THAT MEANT

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:53.205
THAT A LARGE COMPONENT OF WHAT

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:54.206
THE STATE WAS PROVIDING YOU

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:56.809
SEE. DURING SEVERAL THOSE YEARS

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:57.376
WAS A FLEXIBLE INCREASED TO

02:01:57.443 --> 02:02:00.212
THEIR- AT. THE CAMPUS LEVEL

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:02.248
APPROPRIATIONS SO AND SO THE

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:03.649
USE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A

02:02:03.716 --> 02:02:05.451
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OVER.

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:06.852
DID THE STATE FUNDED THE

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:08.688
STUDENTS ARE NOT ONE

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:09.488
PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE THAT THE

02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:11.557
STATE PROVIDED A- A SEVERAL

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:13.359
PERCENT BASE AUGMENTATION THAT

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:15.494
THE UC COULD USE. A HOWEVER

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:17.096
THEY SAW FIT TO ADDRESS COST

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:19.265
PRESSURES. AND TO EXPAND

02:02:19.331 --> 02:02:21.667
ENROLLMENT. OR YOU CAN CALL OUT

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:24.403
A MARGINAL COST AS THE UC IS

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.539
SAYING AND- SO FROM OUR

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:28.607
PERSPECTIVE IT'S IT GOES BACK

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:29.175
TO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:31.077
INTERPRETING THIS YEAR. END OF

02:02:31.143 --> 02:02:32.545
THE DISCUSSION IS I SEEM TO

02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:35.748
REMEMBER. ACT ME IF I'M WRONG

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:38.384
ABOUT WHETHER WE ACTUALLY FUND

02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:40.486
YOU SEE ON A PER STUDENT BASIS.

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:43.189
OR NOT THE WE HAVE THAT

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:46.058
CONVERSATION. YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:47.626
ME MAYBE I'M MAYBE I HAD A

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:48.994
DREAM AND IT WAS A NO THAT'S

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:50.496
DEFINITELY A CONVERSATION THAT

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:52.798
HAS BEEN HAD IN THE PAST AND IS

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:55.968
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN SO. WE

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.604
RECOGNIZE THAT OKAY SIR. YEAH I

02:02:58.671 --> 02:02:59.572
THINK YOU'RE RAISING AN

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:02.041
IMPORTANT- ISSUE WITH HAVING

02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:03.142
THE SORT OF UNRESTRICTED BASE

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.911
INCREASES AND A NOT HAVING-

02:03:05.978 --> 02:03:07.213
FUNDING THAT'S ALWAYS TIED ON A

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:08.280
PER STUDENT BASIS THAT CREATES

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:09.682
CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY

02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.617
THE STATE HAS FUNDED. ALMOND

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:12.985
MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SORT OF

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:14.987
EVALUATE- STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:15.988
IS AND ISN'T FUNDED AT THE

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:16.756
UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:18.023
REASONS WHY WE HEARD THE

02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:19.759
LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY COST

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:21.260
HIGH FUNDING THOSE COSTS. WE%

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:22.027
THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:23.095
IMPORTANT WITH ENROLLMENT

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:25.631
GROWTH- THIS PROPOSED BUDGET

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:26.599
DOESN'T SAID IN A MOMENT

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:28.234
TARGET. OF THE ADMINISTRATION

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.401
HAS SENT OUT SIGNALS IT WOULD

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.903
LIKE YOU SEE TWO GROWN ROMAN

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.371
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PROPOSED

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:34.640
TARGET OR I DON'T OR HI

02:03:34.707 --> 02:03:35.441
SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THAT

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:37.209
PURPOSE- AND WE THINK THAT

02:03:37.276 --> 02:03:38.644
SENDS A CONFUSING SIGNAL TO THE

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.079
UNIVERSITY AND- COULD SET UP

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:41.647
NEXT. WEEK I GET CONFUSED

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:42.615
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:43.482
STATE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:44.850
ACCOMPLISH WE THINK ABOUT OUR

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:46.118
APPROACH IN HIS APPROACH THE

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:47.386
STATE'S TAKEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:49.321
THIS IS TO LIVE BY. THE SUDDEN

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:50.856
AND ROMAN TARGET IN THE BUDGET

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:51.957
THE STATEMENT SETTING THAT

02:03:52.024 --> 02:03:53.192
TARGET ONE YEAR AFTER THE

02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:55.628
BUDGET YOU'RE SO IN IN IN FOR.

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:57.229
INSTEAD OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.397
WOULD SET THE TARGET FOR TWENTY

02:03:58.464 --> 02:03:59.532
ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THEIR

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:00.966
PURPOSE BEHIND THAT IS- THAT

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:02.401
YOU SEE ADMISSIONS PROP-

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:04.436
DECISIONS OFTEN HAPPEN SOMEONE

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:05.171
BEFORE BUDGET DECISIONS ARE

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:06.972
FINALIZED. FOR YOU SEE THIS

02:04:07.039 --> 02:04:09.208
YEAR WILL MAKE- FALL MOMENT

02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:10.309
ADMISSION DECISION SOMETIME IN

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:11.477
THE SPRING BEFORE THE BUDGETS

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:13.078
NOW ACTED IN JUNE SO IF YOU

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:13.979
SAID IN ROMAN TARGET FOR THE

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.181
BUDGET YEAR YOU SEE WILL OF A

02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:15.948
READY MADE FALLEN NATION

02:04:16.015 --> 02:04:17.483
DECISIONS WILL BE TOO LATE TO.

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:18.384
SEND A SIGNAL THAT'S WHY THE

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.885
STATE'S BEEN SET IT UP TARGET

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:21.620
ONE YEAR LATER. ALL WE

02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:23.823
SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE. UNFUNDED

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:25.491
GROWTH ISSUES ON A GO FORWARD

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.026
BASIS YOU KNOW THAT I THINK

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:29.461
PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT-

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:30.196
WHEN THE STATE SET THESE

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:32.131
TARGETS. AT A SAYS THE

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.333
UNIVERSITY NOTED IT DIDN'T SET-

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.701
IT JUST SORT OF SAID THIS IS

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.303
THE LEVEL THAT WE THAT YOU

02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:39.872
SHOULD BE ON GROWING- AND IT

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:42.741
DIDN'T- IT ON IN PASS BUDGETS

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:44.610
WERE WAS OFTEN THE CASE IS THAT

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.378
THE STATE SET OF MARGIN OF

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:47.780
ERROR. FOR RECOGNIZING THAT

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:49.548
ENROLLMENT MAY AS PART OF PART

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.550
IN ART PARTLY SCIENCE. AND SO

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:53.352
IS OFTEN LIKE THEY THERE'S A

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:55.254
10% MARGIN OF ERROR SO THICK.

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:57.189
THEY ADMIT. THAT WORK IN A

02:04:57.256 --> 02:05:03.295
VERY- PORTION OF THE FUND IN

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:03.896
MIGHTGO A SOCIO. BUT NOT ALL

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:04.864
THE- WOULD DISAPPEAR. SO GET A

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:08.000
GAVE THE UNIVERSE. SOME TO SIR

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:08.701
OF MAKE THAT AND- SETS IN A PRO.

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:09.335
THE STATE COULD TAKE A IT WAS

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:13.639
CAN. ABOUT THIS TREND. I THINK

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:14.440
ANOTHER AREA OF UNCERTAINTY IS

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:16.008
THE STATE'S. USED TO SET UP A

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:17.509
BASEMENT BASIN ROMAN TARGETS SO

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:20.279
USED TO SAY YOU'RE FUNDED FOR

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:20.846
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:22.014
STUDENTS ARE HOW MANY STUDENTS

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.482
IT'S SET. IN RECENT YEARS IT

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:24.316
HAS BEEN SETTING A GROWTH

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.318
TARGET WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHAT

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:27.753
THAT BASELINE IS UNIVERSITIES

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.321
BEEN TRYING TO MAKE AN EFFORT

02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:30.689
TO- WORK WITH THE STATE ON THAT

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:31.657
SO THEY'VE BEEN. THEY'VE BEEN

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:33.192
ADMITTING MORE ENROLLING OR

02:05:33.259 --> 02:05:34.159
STUDENTS AND USING THAT AS A

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.728
NEW BASELINE REGARDLESS IF

02:05:35.794 --> 02:05:36.729
THERE IF THEY INVOLVE MORE

02:05:36.795 --> 02:05:38.664
THAN. WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SPECTER

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:40.165
BY THE STATE SO THAT'S ANOTHER

02:05:40.232 --> 02:05:41.233
VERY RICH CREATED SOME

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:41.901
CONFUSION SO THERE ARE WAYS THE

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:43.903
STATE COULD. ON SET A TARGET

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:45.104
THAT GIVES THE UNIVERSITY A

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.939
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY. ON

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:49.241
IN A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ABOUT

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:53.045
WHAT IT'S EXPECTING. I MEAN I

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:54.246
UNDERSTAND THE I THINK I

02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:55.314
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.049
THE BUDGET YEARS AND WE- YOU

02:05:57.116 --> 02:05:58.817
KNOW IF IT'S THIS YEAR. THEY

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:00.886
CAN'T. THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.421
THEY WERE ALREADY ADMITTED. SO

02:06:02.488 --> 02:06:06.792
WE SET NEXT YEAR A TARGET. BUT

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.627
VIEW SEE KNOWS WHAT THEIR COST

02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:11.397
OF EDUCATION IS ELEVEN OR

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:11.931
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:06:11.997 --> 02:06:13.866
STUDENT OR WHATEVER IT IS AND

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:17.236
IF WE WANTED TO GROW BY TWO

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:17.836
THOUSAND WE COULD RUN THE MATH

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:19.238
ON THAT AND SAY HERE'S- X.

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:20.973
AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR. THE GROWTH

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.975
THAT WE EXPECT YOU TO ATTAIN AS

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:27.146
AN INSTITUTION RIGHT. AND THEN

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.914
GIVEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.182
BETWEEN YOU SEE AND ALL THE

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:31.984
REST OF US THEY COULD CHOOSE TO

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:33.018
SPEND THAT ARE NOT SPENT AND I

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:34.920
SUPPOSE. AND THEN COME IN WITH

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:36.488
AN UNFUNDED GROSS NUMBER BUT WE

02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:38.424
WOULD WE WOULD HAVE SAID WE

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:39.992
EXPECT YOU TO GROW BY TWO

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:42.061
THOUSAND STUDENTS YOU TELL US

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:43.295
YOUR COST OF EDUCATION IS THAT

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.030
SEX YOU COST OF EDUCATION IS

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:47.866
WHY. HERE'S A CHECK FOR THE

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:50.169
COST TO FUND THE GROWTH ELEMENT

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:51.904
THAT WE'VE PROGRAMMED INTO OUR

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:54.940
BUDGET IN THE TWENTY. TWENTY

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:56.942
ONE. TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAH

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:58.010
WHAT WE WAS SO WE DO HAVE A PER

02:06:58.077 --> 02:06:59.211
STUDENT FUNDING RATE THAT WE

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:00.279
PROVIDE THEM FOR A MOMENT

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:01.547
GROWTH SO WE DO HAVE A BASIS

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:02.982
TO. DETERMINE HOW MUCH FUNDING

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:04.216
TO PROVIDE FOR ENROLLMENT

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:06.051
GROWTH. I THINK THE ISSUE HERE

02:07:06.118 --> 02:07:07.753
IS THERE'S- SOME UNCERTAINTY

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.621
ABOUT WHAT THE BASELINE TO GROW

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.457
ABOUT IS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:11.991
ENROLL MORE STUDENTS THAN

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:14.259
EXPECTED- WHEN YOU PROVIDE THEM

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:15.361
FUNDING THE NEXT YEAR IS THAT

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:16.295
IS THAT TO PAY DOWN THAT

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:17.563
UNFUNDED STUDENTS OR DO YOU

02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:20.232
AND- DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:20.833
INCORPORATE THE STUDENTS INTO

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:21.600
THE NEW BASS FINDING GROW OFF

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:23.669
OF THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE-

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:24.370
THERE'S THERE COULD BE SOME

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:26.238
UNCERTAINTY THERE. BUT WE DO

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:27.840
HAVE A PERSON FUNDING- RATE

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:29.108
THAT WE PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:30.209
THAT OUT THAT DOES OFFER A

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:31.510
RATIONALE TO PROVIDE FUNDING

02:07:31.577 --> 02:07:33.412
BASED ON LOAN GROWTH WE SHOULD

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.047
BE A FIX THAT PROBLEM RIGHT.

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:36.749
THE ONE YOU IDENTIFIES IT IT'S

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:39.785
YOU HAVE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS IT

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:40.686
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT.

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:43.722
UPBEAT COUPLE OF COMMON SIR. OF

02:07:43.789 --> 02:07:45.991
MILLION MISSED THE POINT. NO NO

02:07:46.058 --> 02:07:47.993
NO YOU AYE. WE HAVE A MARGINAL

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.528
COST OF INSTRUCTION RATE THAT

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:50.696
HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH.

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:52.097
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:54.466
LEGISLATURE IN. LA THAT WE

02:07:54.533 --> 02:07:56.268
AGREE WITH THAT'S THE COST PER

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:58.237
STUDENT THAT WE OFTEN USE. HOW

02:07:58.303 --> 02:07:59.438
MUCH DOES IT COST THE

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:00.739
UNIVERSITY TO EDUCATE SINGLE

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:03.909
STUDENT- WHEN WE DO. AT THESE

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:06.145
UNFUNDED. STUDENTS INTO OUR

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:08.247
BASE IT ERODES THAT DOLLAR PER

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:10.115
STUDENT. AS A HOLD THAT THE

02:08:10.182 --> 02:08:12.751
UNIVERSITY HAS TO SPEND. AND IT

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:14.286
REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE SERVING

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:16.388
NOREEN THIS PROBLEM. OF NOT

02:08:16.455 --> 02:08:18.490
HAVING THE FLATTERING FACULTY.

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:20.459
THAT WE NEED TO- PROVIDE THEM

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:21.894
WITH INSTRUCTION WE'RE JUST

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:22.628
TRYING TO STUFF THE STUDENTS

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.930
INTO THE- INTO THE CLASSROOMS.

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:26.665
BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:27.666
TO MAKE IS THAT WHEN THE

02:08:27.733 --> 02:08:30.502
UNIVERSITY HAS. OF INFLATIONARY

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:33.338
COST INCREASES. WITH IN A

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:35.808
REASONABLE. MARGIN OF. TWO

02:08:35.874 --> 02:08:37.776
POINT FIVE TO TWO POINT 8%

02:08:37.843 --> 02:08:40.045
ACROSS ALL OUR CAMPUS FUNDS

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:42.081
ACROSS ALL THOSE CORE FUNDS.

02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:44.016
AND WE GET GIVEN A 2% STATE

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:45.117
GENERAL FUND INCREASES

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:47.419
HAPPENED. TWO OR 3% AS HAPPENED

02:08:47.486 --> 02:08:49.288
UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. SKIN AND

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:51.323
THEN AT THE SAME TIME GOT TOLD

02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:53.892
NOT TO INCREASE TUITION. OF AND

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:56.628
THEN EXPECTED. TO INK IF WE GET

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.263
THEN GET TOLD THAT WE HAVE THE-

02:08:58.330 --> 02:08:59.598
OPTION TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.867
THAT'S NOT A REAL. OPTION WE

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.936
NEED THOSE INFLATIONARY COST

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:07.106
INCREASES. IN KEEPING IT. AT A

02:09:07.172 --> 02:09:10.042
MODEST INFLATIONARY INCREASE IS

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:11.577
JUST REALISTIC FOR WHAT IT

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:13.679
COSTS TO DO BUSINESS. FOR OUR

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.614
CAMPUSES BUT WHERE'S MY

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:16.849
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DELTA

02:09:16.915 --> 02:09:19.284
BETWEEN WHATEVER IN. THE DELTA

02:09:19.351 --> 02:09:22.588
OF NINETY FIVE WHATEVER HIS

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:24.123
POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN.

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:25.524
DOES THAT MAINTAIN THE FLAT

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.126
LINE AND THEN ARE WE TALKING

02:09:27.192 --> 02:09:28.560
ABOUT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AND

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:29.995
HOW MUCH THEY COST AND WHO'S

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:31.430
GOING TO PAY FOR THEM AND IS IT

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:32.297
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND OR OUT

02:09:32.364 --> 02:09:34.766
OF TUITION. AND IF THERE'S SOME

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:13.491
ALSO MISS GOING TO THE WORK

02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:15.994
FORCE TWO YEARS SOONER. AND

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:18.496
THEIR LIFETIME EARNINGS ARE

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:20.332
ACTUALLY LESS THAN THOSE WHO

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:21.666
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS SO IT'LL

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:25.570
BUT SET. UP EQUITY. THE.

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:26.871
STUDENTS TO HAVE A GREAT IN A

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:27.806
TIMELY MANNER AND WE HAVE A

02:17:27.872 --> 02:17:29.574
SEAT PROGRAMS WE'D LIKE TO

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:31.343

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:37.415
KEEP THEM ON ACADEMIC TRACK.

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:38.283
BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING THAT WE

02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:39.851
HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:42.487
GRADUATING. IN FIVE YEARS

02:17:42.554 --> 02:17:43.622
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:44.923
MISSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:47.392
OFFERED IN THE SPRING TIME. AND

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:49.628
THEN THEY HAVE TO STAY LONGER

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:51.062
IN ORDER TO TAKE THAT COURSE SO

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:53.698
WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THEM-

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.266
ESPECIALLY IF THEY MISS A SEAT

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:56.701
COURSE IN A SERIES TO TAKE

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.536
THOSE IN A SUMMERTIME SO THAT

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:01.873
THEY CAN GRADUATE ON TIME. OF

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:02.907

REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION

02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:20.225
DOLLARS THESE EFFORTS. IN

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.794
TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY ONE. LET

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:24.596
ME ASK A QUESTION HERE WITH THE

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:26.364
GOVERNOR'S ACTIVE OF

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:29.801
PARTICIPATION OBVIOUSLY- OF- WE

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:33.171
DID THIS SUMMER. WE JUST GOT

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.139
SUMMER CAL GRANT IT'S A

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.140
DIFFERENT SUMMER TUITION

02:18:35.206 --> 02:18:37.609
ASSISTANCE SEVEN EIGHT PROGRAM

02:18:37.676 --> 02:18:40.311
FINANCIAL AID. THAT WAS IN LAST

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:41.012
YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE

02:18:41.079 --> 02:18:44.182
GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED THAT- IN

02:18:44.249 --> 02:18:47.252
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- HAS UC

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.287
DESIGN SOME SORT OF A- SYSTEM

02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:52.957
OF TRYING TO. RECOVER DATA AND

02:18:53.024 --> 02:18:55.360
APPLY SOME METRICS ANALYSIS TO

02:18:55.427 --> 02:18:57.862
THIS PROGRAM TO SEE WHAT THE

02:18:57.929 --> 02:18:59.464
ACTUAL RESULT IS AND WHETHER

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:00.999
THERE'S A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:03.468
OF THERE'S A COST BENEFIT-

02:19:03.535 --> 02:19:05.804
CONNECTION HERE UP I'M GLAD YOU

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:09.074
pBRIDGE AND YOU MENTIONED

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:11.276
SUMMERS SO IT'S A NATURAL

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:12.844
ORIGIN I THINK IT IS ON A

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.412
SLIGHT EIGHTEEN I HAVE A GRAPH

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.780
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.916
HOPEFULLY. OF SHOWING THAT IN

02:19:17.982 --> 02:19:21.052
THE LAST YEAR NOW THAT SUMMER-

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:23.722
OF FINANCIAL AID IS IN PLACE WE

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:26.925
SAW A JUMP OF THREE THOUSAND

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:27.792
ONE HUNDRED HEAD COUNT STUDENTS

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:30.395
ATTENDING SUMMER- BUT OVER THE

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:33.665
LAST OF FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:36.000
GROWTH IN TEN THOUSAND HEAD

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.669
COUNT STUDENTS ATTENDING SUMMER

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:39.471
THESE ARE STUDENTS WERE TAKING

02:19:39.537 --> 02:19:41.639
AT LEAST ONE COURSE DURING THE

02:19:41.706 --> 02:19:43.608
SUMMER. SO WE THINK WE ARE

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:46.077
SEEING UP THIS IN THE OF THREE

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:48.113
DOT ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS THINK

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.247
IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:52.117
FINANCIAL AID AND- WE'VE MET

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:54.319
HOW DO WE SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT

02:19:54.385 --> 02:19:58.389
THOSE ATTENDING AN EARLY

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:00.158
GRADUATION. SYSTEM BODY WHOSE

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:01.493
TAKING A SUMMER COURSE NOT SO

02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:02.627
THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE THEY

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:04.329
WOULDN'T. YOU KNOW THEY

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:05.630
OBVIOUSLY NEED FINANCIAL AID SO

02:20:05.697 --> 02:20:06.531
I WOULD THINK THEY'D BE

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:08.066
JUDICIOUS WITH WHAT THEY TAKE

02:20:08.133 --> 02:20:09.701
AND HOW LONG THEY STAY AROUND

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:11.970
BUT- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:13.972
A FINE ARTS COURSE THAT'S OF.

02:20:14.038 --> 02:20:15.673
AN EXTRA SUPPOSED TO OF COURSE

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:16.741
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:17.909
TOWARD READ THE GREEK

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:20.145
COMPLETION OUR CAMPUSES ARE

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:21.679
EXAMINING WHERE THE BOTTLE NECK

02:20:21.746 --> 02:20:23.681
COURSES ARE. THAT MAY BE

02:20:23.748 --> 02:20:25.750
SLOWING STUDENTS DOWN THOSE ARE

02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:27.952
THE COURSES THAT HAVE- EITHER

02:20:28.019 --> 02:20:30.622
REACH 100% ENROLLMENT OR CLOSE

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:32.957
TO IT DURING THE YEAR- AND

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:34.826
LOOKING OUT HOW THEY COULD MOVE

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.494
THAT SOME OF THOSE COURSES

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:37.362
DUPLICATE THEM DURING THE

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:38.696
SUMMER TIME. TO ENCOURAGE

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.598
STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:41.766
ABLE TO GET INTO A COURSE

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:43.768
DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR TO

02:20:43.835 --> 02:20:44.369
THEN TAKE THAT COURSE DURING

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:46.771
THE SUMMER AND WILL WE BE ABLE

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:49.874
TO TELL WHETHER. WELL THAT.

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:52.377
JANE RECEIVED A SUMMER

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:55.446
FINANCIAL AID AND THAT. JANE

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:58.082
ULTIMATELY GRADUATED. A

02:20:58.149 --> 02:21:01.352
SEMESTER EARLY OR WE WILL BE I

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:02.987
WILL BE DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:05.089
DETAIL THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:21:05.156 --> 02:21:06.758
NEED THAT BUT WHAT WE WOULD

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:09.527
NEED IS WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE

02:21:09.594 --> 02:21:11.396
PROGRAM HAS BEEN. WE WILL BE

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:13.198
ABLE TO GET THAT DATA ONCE

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:15.800
STUDENTS START GRADUATING SO WE

02:21:15.867 --> 02:21:17.468
USUALLY LOOK AT FROM FRESHMAN.

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:19.237
LOOK THE FOUR YEARS AND THENCE

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:21.739
A FIVE AND SIX AND SO IT TAKES

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:23.274
SEVERAL YEARS FOR THAT DATA TO

02:21:23.341 --> 02:21:24.576
COME IN BUT WHAT WE WOULD LOOK

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:27.445
AT IS AVERAGES. WITHIN A

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:29.781
CERTAIN STUDENT TYPE SO WE

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:30.982
MIGHT LOOK AT A PELL GRANT

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:35.220
RECIPIENT WHO IS A U. R. G. WHO

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:38.756
ATTENDED AS A FRESHMAN AND- OF.

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:40.358
THEN WOULD LOOK HOW LONG DID IT

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.627
TAKE THAT PERSON DOES THAT

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:47.632
PERSON TO GRADUATE AND- START

02:21:47.699 --> 02:21:49.067
LOOKING AT IF THE AVERAGES FOR

02:21:49.133 --> 02:21:53.238
SIR. HI OUR- WELL I WOULD

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:56.908
IMAGINE OF GIVEN THE WAY THE

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:59.577
BUDGET WORKS IN THE STATE. FOR

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:01.179
THOSE WHO BETTER A LOT LONGER

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:03.748
THAN I HAVE BEEN- AT SOME POINT

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:05.216
IN TIME WHEN BUDGETS BECOME

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:07.418
EVEN MORE CHALLENGED- HOPEFULLY

02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:09.153
WE WILL HAVE SOME DATA BECAUSE

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.289
WITH BUDGET PRESSURES. I THINK

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.924
IT WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:13.791
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS

02:22:13.858 --> 02:22:15.894
PROGRAM ACTUALLY HAS AN IMPACT

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:18.162
AND AFFECT ON GETTING. YOUNG

02:22:18.229 --> 02:22:19.797
AND NOT SO YOUNG FOLKS THROUGH

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:23.601
OUR UC SYSTEM YOU KNOW EARLIER.

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:25.036
AND SOMEONE CAN DO A COST

02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:26.437
BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THAT MAKE

02:22:26.504 --> 02:22:27.472
IT YOU KNOW AND IF IT IS

02:22:27.538 --> 02:22:28.573
BENEFICIAL CONTINUE THE

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:30.408
PROGRAMS OF THANK YOU FOR

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:31.943
WORKING THAT YET WAIT WE HAVE A

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:33.878
GREAT INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:36.114
TEAM AT A U. C. O. P. AND I'M

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:38.082
CERTAIN THEY'LL GET RIGHT ON

02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:39.651
THAT AND I SEE PART OF YOUR

02:22:39.717 --> 02:22:42.020
SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST IS

02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:43.054
HAS TO DO WITH STUDENT

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:44.589
ADVISING. AND I THINK WE'RE

02:22:44.656 --> 02:22:47.191
GONNA GET UP LATER. OF IF I GET

02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:49.093
THE RIGHT REQUEST I THINK YOU

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.496
DO SO PART OF THE SIXTY MILLION

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:55.300
THIS LOOKING AT. IS GETTING

02:22:55.366 --> 02:22:58.169
STUDENTS WHO ARE. FALL INTO

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:59.037
GROUPS WHO DON'T GRADUATE AT

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:01.406
THE SAME OF RADIUS NON PELL

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:03.875
RECIPIENTS AND- MAKE CERTAIN

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:05.343

ACADEMIC ADVISING LIKE WE'RE

02:23:08.913 --> 02:23:10.348
STUDENTS WHO ARE FALLING

02:23:10.415 --> 02:23:13.484
BEHIND- IN THEIR- ACADEMIC

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:16.554
PLANS HAVING MID TERMS CHECK

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:20.358
INS WITH AN ADVISER. OR HAVING

02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:24.295
EVEN MORE IN DEPTH- HANDS ON

02:23:24.362 --> 02:23:26.197
ASSISTANCE LIKE. THE START

02:23:26.264 --> 02:23:28.900
MISSING- THEY MISS AND EXAMINED

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.869
THEIR COURSE. THE PROFESSOR CAN

02:23:31.936 --> 02:23:33.871
LET THE ADVISER NO HOOKED AND

02:23:33.938 --> 02:23:35.206
CHECKS IN WITH THE STUDENTS TO

02:23:35.273 --> 02:23:36.774
SEE WHAT THEIR IF SOMETHING IS

02:23:36.841 --> 02:23:38.743
HAPPENING IN THEIR LIVES AND

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:40.678
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT OTHER.

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:43.181
THINGS AROUND THINGS LIKE INS-

02:23:43.247 --> 02:23:44.749
INSECURITY ABOUT HOUSING

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:46.484
INSECURITY ABOUT FOOD STUDENT

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:49.053
MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE IMPACTING

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:50.355
WHETHER OR NOT THAT STUDENT HAS

02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:52.190
THAT CONTINUITY AND COULD

02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:53.758
HAVING AN ADVISER WHO CONNECTS

02:23:53.825 --> 02:23:56.260
THEM TO SERVICES ON THE CAMPUS

02:23:56.327 --> 02:23:58.930
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE CAN

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:00.131
TO I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER

02:24:00.198 --> 02:24:01.366
DISCUSSION ABOUT- PROBABLY AND

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:02.667
STUDENT FEES SERVICES SECTION

02:24:02.734 --> 02:24:05.370
ON ECONOMIC COUNSELING BUT YES.

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:06.804
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:07.805
BIT MORE ABOUT- CATCHER TO

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:09.073
STUDENT RATIOS BOTH IN THE

02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:10.475
ACADEMIC IN THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:14.178
SIDE AND- BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO

02:24:14.245 --> 02:24:16.714
ME THAT. ON THE GRADUATION RATE

02:24:16.781 --> 02:24:19.283
INITIATIVES WHICH- YOU HAVE ONE

02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.585
BUT CERTAINLY SEE ISSUE AS THE

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:24.022
MAN. THE ACADEMIC HOUSING MUST

02:24:24.088 --> 02:24:25.690
PLAY A PRETTY IMPORTANT ROLE IN

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:27.458
THE AVAILABILITY OF CANCERS AND

02:24:27.525 --> 02:24:29.127
MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS GET

02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:31.229
THROUGH THE PIPELINE. YOU KNOW

02:24:31.295 --> 02:24:32.597
ON TIME ON TARGET WITH THE

02:24:32.663 --> 02:24:34.132
DEGREE THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.334
WELL I HAVE. YES WE'RE FINDING

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:38.536
IT THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YES

THEY ARE NOT FUNDED. AND THEY

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:19.550

02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:45.009
REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.944

02:39:34.197 --> 02:39:36.967
POST FOCUSED ON LINE. PRO

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:38.435
THAT'S BECAUSE THE ADULT

02:39:38.502 --> 02:39:41.838
POPULATION HAS A HIGHER LEVELS

02:39:41.905 --> 02:39:42.940
OF CONSTRUED IT'S THEIR DAILY

02:39:43.006 --> 02:39:44.608
LIVES SO ONLINE IS A GOOD WAY

02:39:44.675 --> 02:39:48.211
TO. TO REACH THEM. SO THAT'S

02:39:48.278 --> 02:39:49.346
EIGHTY. HIGH LEVEL LET IT

02:39:49.413 --> 02:39:50.881
OVERLAPS ULTIMATELY BE VIEWED

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:53.083
AS- THE COMMUNITY HELPS YOU

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:54.952
KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE TO

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:58.188
THAT. LEVEL OF ASSIST IN THE

02:39:58.255 --> 02:40:01.591
WAY THAT YOU SIX WHAT. AND FOR

02:40:01.658 --> 02:40:02.793
I THINK OF. WE'RE GOING TO

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:05.295
FIGURE OUT THIS P. RATHER. BUT

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.064
LET ME ASK ME ASK A QUESTION

02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:08.765
AND I DIDN'T ASK IT SO WE'RE

02:40:08.832 --> 02:40:12.202
TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO. HAVE

02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:13.603
ATTENDED A FOUR YEAR

02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:16.173
INSTITUTION PRESUMABLY AND BUT

02:40:16.239 --> 02:40:18.141
DIDN'T QUITE COMPLETED AGREE I

02:40:18.208 --> 02:40:19.376
THINK THAT'S WHAT AND I

02:40:19.443 --> 02:40:21.178
REMEMBER THAT FROM LAST YEAR

02:40:21.244 --> 02:40:23.780
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO A RE

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:26.583
INTEGRATE INTO TO TRADITIONAL.

02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:28.485
FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS

02:40:28.552 --> 02:40:30.687
PROGRAMMING STREAM TO COMPLETE

02:40:30.754 --> 02:40:32.823
THE COURSE OF TWO OR FOR THAT A

02:40:32.889 --> 02:40:35.025
PERSON NEEDS IN ORDER TO GET

02:40:35.092 --> 02:40:38.595
THAT DEGREE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

02:40:38.662 --> 02:40:41.231
ISSUES APPARENTLY AND- FIRING

02:40:41.298 --> 02:40:42.733
UP THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM I

02:40:42.799 --> 02:40:45.435
GUESS IS TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO

02:40:45.502 --> 02:40:48.205
COME BACK AFTER FOR FIVE YEARS

02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:50.440
AND PICK UP YOU KNOW THE UPPER

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:54.011
DIVISION ENGLISH COURSE FOR.

02:40:54.077 --> 02:40:56.079
HISTORY COURSE YOUR MATH COURSE

02:40:56.146 --> 02:40:57.981
WERE FOUR FIVE OF THEM

02:40:58.048 --> 02:41:02.052
NECESSARY TO. ACHIEVE A DEGREE

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:06.523
FROM SOMEWHERE. IS THAT A FAIR

02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:08.258
QUESTION WHAT IS WHAT IS THE

02:41:08.325 --> 02:41:10.127
PROCESS AND HOW DIFFICULT IS IT

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:11.728
AND WHAT OBSTACLES WILL THE

02:41:11.795 --> 02:41:14.197
EXTENSION PROGRAM OVERCOME THAT

02:41:14.264 --> 02:41:16.033
EXIST IN THE CURRENT. SAID A

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:19.302
PROGRAM I'M NOT CERTAIN ARE

02:41:19.369 --> 02:41:20.537
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE

02:41:20.604 --> 02:41:22.072
PROPOSALS FOR MY EXTENSION HOW

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:23.774
THEY INTEND TO OVERCOME THE

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:25.709
PROBLEMS THAT THE OR THE

02:41:25.776 --> 02:41:27.177
OBSTACLES THAT THE STUDENTS

02:41:27.244 --> 02:41:28.745
FACE WE DO KNOW THAT TUDENTS

02:41:28.812 --> 02:41:30.147
WHO ARE RETURNING ARE OLDER

02:41:30.213 --> 02:41:31.648
THEY OFTEN HAVE FAMILIES AND

02:41:31.715 --> 02:41:33.116
CHILDREN THEY MAY HAVE SOME

02:41:33.183 --> 02:41:35.552
CHILD CARE ISSUES GOING ON AND

02:41:35.619 --> 02:41:38.088
THEN- THEY DO NEED TO FIND A

02:41:38.155 --> 02:41:40.390
TIME FOR COURSE WORK IN BETWEEN

02:41:40.457 --> 02:41:42.092
HAVING AN ACTUAL. OF

02:41:42.159 --> 02:41:45.829
POTENTIALLY A FULL TIME JOB SO

02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:49.166
OF COURSE NOT THAT MY- ONE

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:50.667
HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE UNITS

02:41:50.734 --> 02:41:55.539
AT- AT. UC MERCED. AGE OUT FIVE

02:41:55.605 --> 02:41:57.808
YEARS LATER. THEIR YOUR UNITS

02:41:57.874 --> 02:41:59.776
WOULD STILL BE GOOD IT'S JUST

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:01.178
GETTING THAT STUDENT TO COME

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:02.946
BACK AND COMPLETE AND WE DO

02:42:03.013 --> 02:42:04.481
THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:06.883
OPPORTUNITY WE DID AN ANALYSIS.

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:09.786
OF STUDENTS WHO LEAVE

02:42:09.853 --> 02:42:10.854
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:12.722
WITHOUT OF COMPLETING A DEGREE

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:15.325
WE FOUND OUT THAT ABOUT 36% OF

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:17.194
THEM HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:19.196
UNITS COMPLETED. SOME MAJORS

02:42:19.262 --> 02:42:21.098
ONLY NEED HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS

02:42:21.164 --> 02:42:22.799
SO THEY'RE VERY VERY CLOSE AND

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:23.834
IF WE COULD CAPTURE DOT

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.669
POPULATION BRING THEM BACK AND

02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:26.603
HAVE THEM COMPLETE THEIR

02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:29.272
DEGREES. THEY WOULD HAVE MUCH

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:31.775
GREATER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.

02:42:31.842 --> 02:42:32.776
WHETHER A LOT OF ISSUES

02:42:32.843 --> 02:42:36.947
FINANCIAL AID COST ME IN THE WE

02:42:37.013 --> 02:42:38.448
NEED AT SOME POINT IF THIS.

02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:44.688
PROGRAM. DEVELOP SWINGS AND

02:42:44.754 --> 02:42:46.756
EXPANDS WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:48.725
BUT IT'S I DON'T WANT TO

02:42:48.792 --> 02:42:51.027
BELABOR IT IT'S A FAIRLY MINOR

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:54.698
INVESTMENT IN A- AND- IN AN

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:58.835
EXPERIMENT IS OF CALL IT AND-

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:00.036
WILL MOVE FORWARD LOOK FORWARD

02:43:00.103 --> 02:43:01.872
TO SEEING WHICH PLAN LOOKS LIKE

02:43:01.938 --> 02:43:02.939
LA- YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO

02:43:03.006 --> 02:43:04.941
SAY. SIR I JUST IN OUR ANALYSIS

02:43:05.008 --> 02:43:07.544
WE RAISED EXACTLY THE SAME

02:43:07.611 --> 02:43:08.145
CONCERN SO YOU'RE RAISING NOW

02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:09.246
IN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT NOW

02:43:09.312 --> 02:43:12.949
TRYING TO INVESTIGATE MORE. WE

02:43:13.016 --> 02:43:14.317
THE PROBLEM STATEMENT STILL

02:43:14.384 --> 02:43:15.852
REMAINS UNCLEAR TO LAST WEEK

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:16.786
THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS OF

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:18.088
STUDENTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA OF

02:43:18.155 --> 02:43:20.323
SOME CALLS BUT NO DEGREE BUT

02:43:20.390 --> 02:43:20.857
THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS

02:43:20.924 --> 02:43:21.491
LACKING AS TO HOW MANY OF THE

02:43:21.558 --> 02:43:23.460
STUDENTS. WANT TO COME BACK TO

02:43:23.527 --> 02:43:24.094
SCHOOL AND GET ABOUT HIS DEGREE

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:27.063
MIGHT BARRIERS THEY- FACE. ON

02:43:27.130 --> 02:43:28.131
THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY BE THE

02:43:28.198 --> 02:43:29.833
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION- THAT THE

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:30.967
ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD SEEK

02:43:31.034 --> 02:43:33.303
TO ANSWER BEFORE- DE

02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:35.539
IDENTIFYING A SOLUTION TO IT-

02:43:35.605 --> 02:43:37.874
EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT- THE

02:43:37.941 --> 02:43:40.177
PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED- WE ALSO

02:43:40.243 --> 02:43:41.478
KNOW THAT THERE A LOT OF.

02:43:41.545 --> 02:43:43.146
OPTIONS REENTRY OPTIONS

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:44.848
CURRENTLY INCLUDING- EXISTING

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:48.251
PROGRAMS AT CSU EXTENSION THAT

02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:48.718
OUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:50.720
COMPLETION PROGRAMS. IT BEYOND

02:43:50.787 --> 02:43:51.821
ALL THAT TO ADD EXTENSION

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.723
PROGRAMS BOTH THE UC AND CSU

02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:55.592
ARE SELF SUPPORTING AS YOU

02:43:55.659 --> 02:43:57.394
NOTED- THROUGH STUDENT FEES WAS

02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:58.728
IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY STATE

02:43:58.795 --> 02:44:00.430
FUNDING IS NEEDED. PARTICULARLY

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:02.599
BECAUSE ONE OF THE OF. A JOBS

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.334
OF AN EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO

02:44:04.401 --> 02:44:05.802
MAINTAIN RESERVES THAT IT CAN

02:44:05.869 --> 02:44:08.038
THEN USE TO PLAN FOR FUTURE

02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:09.973
PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:11.141
FINALLY WE THINK IT'S

02:44:11.208 --> 02:44:14.244
PREMATURE- TO PROVIDE FUNDING

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:14.844
FOR THE PROGRAM PROGRAM GIVEN

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:16.846
THAT. A SIMILAR PROGRAM

02:44:16.913 --> 02:44:18.148
INITIATIVES FUNDED LAST YEAR'S

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:19.149
BUDGET LEGISLATURE AS LITTLE

02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:20.584
INFORMATION AS TO HOW THOSE

02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.152
FUNDS WILL BE SPENT IN. OTHER

02:44:22.219 --> 02:44:22.819
RELATIVE SUCCESS SO IT'S A

02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:24.287
LITTLE PREMATURE TO RENT THEM

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.389
UP AT THIS TIME RECOMMEND

02:44:26.456 --> 02:44:27.023
REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:30.026
YEAR. WELL HELLO I WAS TRAINED

LIKE TO TRY TO. IF THIS IS OF

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:40.103
INTEREST TO THE ADMINISTRATION

02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:44.674
pSECOND YEAR. I'D LIKE TO TRY TO

02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:46.443
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE.

02:44:46.509 --> 02:44:47.344

AGO ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS. ITEM

02:45:04.761 --> 02:45:05.595
ONE ONE AREA THAT MIGHT- THE

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:07.364
HELP IS- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

02:45:07.430 --> 02:45:08.398

THE UNDERLYING CAUSES FURTHER

02:45:13.503 --> 02:45:15.205
STUDYING THE ISSUE. THAT COULD

02:45:15.272 --> 02:45:17.073
BE ONE POTENTIAL AREA.

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:18.041
LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ATTENTION

02:45:18.108 --> 02:45:21.911
ONOUR- AS IT'S THINKING ABOUT-

02:45:21.978 --> 02:45:22.445

THAT ARE OCCASIONED BY THIS

02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:45.302
CURRENT THE SITUATION THAT

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:47.671
WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND THE

RESISTANCE TO OFFER THEM BEFORE

02:45:56.646 --> 02:45:59.215
AND SO WE COULD SEE ONLINE

OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE FUTURE

02:46:02.118 --> 02:46:04.421
EXPAND- IN AREAS WHERE THEY

CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST AND THAT

02:46:06.356 --> 02:46:08.925
MAY CHANGE THE CALCULUS HERE AS

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:10.660
TO WHETHER WE USED THE

02:46:10.727 --> 02:46:12.696

02:46:39.456 --> 02:46:41.024
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:42.959
AT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING. TO

02:46:43.026 --> 02:46:44.361

WE'RE NOW DOING THE SURVEY

02:50:08.531 --> 02:50:10.667
EVERY TWO YEARS. SO WE WILL

02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:13.670
HAVE MORE. RESPONDENTS IN THE

02:50:13.736 --> 02:50:16.105
IN THE FUTURE ON HOW MANY

02:50:16.172 --> 02:50:17.273

SUMMER BUT WE'RE ONLY COUNTY

02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:30.954
THAT WAS ONE. WILL WE WILL WE

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:35.458
ULTIMATELY- RECEIVE A REPORT.

02:50:35.525 --> 02:50:38.361
AS THE LEGISLATURE ON. BOTH

02:50:38.428 --> 02:50:40.563

STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTS I

02:50:50.039 --> 02:50:52.442
BELIEVE ONE OF THEM UP IS TO

02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:54.611
VERY SOON WHERE THEY GET DOES

02:50:54.677 --> 02:50:55.812
IS IT THIS OF ONE OF THE

LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE A

02:50:58.748 --> 02:50:59.782
YES I THINK THAT'S HOW THE

02:50:59.849 --> 02:51:01.117
STATUTE IS WRITTEN THAT THE

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:02.719

I BELIEVE GETS A- GOT A COPY.

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:19.268
OF THOSE REPORTS BUT- WE WILL

02:51:19.335 --> 02:51:20.503
MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU GOT ONE

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:22.005
ONCE IT'S RELEASED AND THE

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:23.773
REASON I ASK OF COURSE IS I'M

02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:25.008
LOOKING DOWN HERE AND OF COURSE

02:51:25.074 --> 02:51:27.377
SOME. CAMPUSES WERE THE USE

02:51:27.443 --> 02:51:28.945
WORDS LIKE ESTABLISHING A FUND

02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:30.413
WILL THAT WORK THAT'S GOOD AND

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:31.848
WE CAN THE REPORT SHOULD

02:51:31.914 --> 02:51:34.050
INDICATE. THAT THE FUND WAS

02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:36.285
ESTABLISHED IN WHAT IN THE HOW

02:51:36.352 --> 02:51:38.154
IT USED ANOTHER ONE SAYS

02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:39.355
FORMING A PARTNERSHIP WITH A

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.457
PARTICULAR COUNTY. TO ENSURE

02:51:41.524 --> 02:51:43.126
AVAILABILITY SO THE REPORT

02:51:43.192 --> 02:51:44.761
WOULD INDICATE SHOULD INDICATE

02:51:44.827 --> 02:51:46.095
THAT THE PARTNERSHIP FOR

02:51:46.162 --> 02:51:49.298
INFORMED AND WHAT IT'S DOING.

02:51:49.365 --> 02:51:50.566
AND HOW THE MONEY SPENT OR-

02:51:50.633 --> 02:51:52.669
PARTNERSHIP WAS NOT FORMED. AND

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:53.703
THEN THOSE OF US WHO WERE

02:51:53.770 --> 02:51:55.471
INTERESTED IN PROVIDING GREASE

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:56.873
TO THAT WE'LL COULD APPLY A

02:51:56.939 --> 02:51:58.141
LITTLE GREASE AND MAKE SURE

02:51:58.207 --> 02:51:59.642
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS SO THAT

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:01.511
WE TAKE CARE OF. HIM TO TAKE

02:52:01.577 --> 02:52:04.914
CARE OF THE HOUSING NEEDS OF.

02:52:04.981 --> 02:52:06.582
OF STUDENTS AS QUICKLY AS WE

02:52:06.649 --> 02:52:09.619
CAN EXACTLY THE INTENT HERE IS

02:52:09.686 --> 02:52:10.520
TO REALLY ENSURE THAT OUR

02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:13.923
STUDENTS. UP ARE SAFE. AND THAT

02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:16.459
THEY HAVE THEIR OF BASIC HUMAN

02:52:16.526 --> 02:52:18.961
NEEDS TAKEN CARE OF SO THAT

02:52:19.028 --> 02:52:20.430
THEY CAN FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES.

02:52:20.496 --> 02:52:21.898
I WILL- CHECK IN ON THOSE

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:23.232
REPORTS AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT

02:52:23.299 --> 02:52:25.201
THEY CONTAIN INFORMATION. ABOUT

02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:27.904
THE ACTUAL STEPS TAKEN AND WHAT

02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:30.940
THE OUTCOMES WERE. OF THOSE

02:52:31.007 --> 02:52:32.375
STEPS OF MUCH AS WE CAN REPORT

02:52:32.442 --> 02:52:34.110
ON A HELPFUL I MEAN I'M YES I

02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:35.411
DON'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES

02:52:35.478 --> 02:52:37.547
BUT I THINK I COULD SAY THE

02:52:37.613 --> 02:52:38.915
MIKE. MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

02:52:38.981 --> 02:52:40.349
LEGISLATURE I'M SURE THAT

02:52:40.416 --> 02:52:43.019
REPRESENT THESE AREAS- WOULD BE

02:52:43.086 --> 02:52:45.088
VERY INTERESTED IF. RAPID RE

02:52:45.154 --> 02:52:46.389
HOUSING EFFORT TO NOT MOVING

02:52:46.456 --> 02:52:48.524
ALONG QUITE AS SWIFTLY AS THEY

02:52:48.591 --> 02:52:52.428
SHOULD. NOT BECAUSE OF FUNDING

02:52:52.495 --> 02:52:54.397
BUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:56.466
PARTICIPATION OR COOPERATION AT

02:52:56.532 --> 02:52:59.836
SOME LEVEL BELOW US IN EXACTLY-

02:52:59.902 --> 02:53:01.871
YES I WILL CHECK ON THAT. IN

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:03.673
THIS FIRST YEAR HESE RAPID RE

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:05.408
HOUSING FUNDS ALLOWED CAMPUSES

02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:07.443
TO CONDUCT FOCUS GROUPS ON WHY

02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:09.479
STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCING

02:53:09.545 --> 02:53:12.148
HOMELESSNESS AND OF THE KIND OF

02:53:12.215 --> 02:53:13.116
LIVING CONDITIONS THAT THEY

02:53:13.182 --> 02:53:15.518
HAD. OF THE FOCUS GROUPS FOUND

02:53:15.585 --> 02:53:17.253
THAT STUDENTS WERE CHOOSING TO

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:19.021
LIVE IN VERY OVERCROWDED

02:53:19.088 --> 02:53:20.823
SITUATIONS WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE

02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:22.892
IN THE SINGLE BEDROOM. OF IN

02:53:22.959 --> 02:53:24.694
ORDER TO MAKE THEIR MONEY LASTS

02:53:24.761 --> 02:53:26.162
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND THEY

02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:28.197
WERE ALSO PRIORITIZING HOUSING

02:53:28.264 --> 02:53:30.700
OVER FOOD. SO THE HOUSING AND

02:53:30.767 --> 02:53:32.869
SECURITY IS ALSO IMPACTING THE

02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:34.203
FOODS IN SECURITY FOR THE

02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:36.672
STUDENTS. OF IN IN THIS BURST

02:53:36.739 --> 02:53:38.407
YEAR TO CAMPUS ARE FOCUSING ON

02:53:38.474 --> 02:53:39.742
TWO PRIMARY ACTIVITIES THEY'RE

02:53:39.809 --> 02:53:41.644
HIRING STAFF WHO ARE BUILDING

02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:43.112
THESE NETWORKS WITH COMMUNITY

02:53:43.179 --> 02:53:45.348
HOUSING PROVIDERS. OF AND

02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:46.849
ADDRESSING THE STUDENT CRISIS

02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:48.551
SITUATIONS AND THEY'RE ALSO

02:53:48.618 --> 02:53:50.987
OFFERING TO STUDENTS SMALL

02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:52.688
EMERGENCY HOUSING GRANTS. BUT

02:53:52.755 --> 02:53:54.323
THESE ARE JUST A FEW HUNDRED

02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:55.591
DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:53:55.658 --> 02:53:56.759
STUDENT DOESN'T LOSE THEIR

02:53:56.826 --> 02:53:57.927
APARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT

02:53:57.994 --> 02:53:59.929
MORE EXPENSIVE ALSO TO GET THE

02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:01.631
STUDENT INTO HOUSING AGAIN.

02:54:01.697 --> 02:54:03.499
ONCE THEY HAVE BECOME HOMELESS

02:54:03.566 --> 02:54:05.568
PARTLY BECAUSE IN A LOT OF THE

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:07.503
CITIES NEAR OUR CAMPUSES.

02:54:07.570 --> 02:54:09.372
THERE'S ONLY A FEW APARTMENT

02:54:09.438 --> 02:54:11.407

03:10:40.162 --> 03:10:42.597
BOOKS THE STATE HAS A POLICY

03:10:42.664 --> 03:10:43.131
GOAL OF NOTE TREATABLE OR

EUTHANIZED. AND PROVIDING FIFTY

03:10:47.435 --> 03:10:49.304
MILLION. IS GOING TO. BE A

03:10:49.371 --> 03:10:51.373
GIANT LEAP FORWARD IN TRYING TO

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:52.574
ACHIEVE THAT EXISTING POLICY

03:10:52.641 --> 03:10:54.709
GOAL. IN TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY

03:10:54.776 --> 03:10:57.379
WOULD BE SPENT OVER A PERIOD OF

03:10:57.445 --> 03:10:59.915
TIME AND WHY- IT'S ACTUALLY

03:10:59.981 --> 03:11:00.949
GOING TO HAVE ON GOING

03:11:01.016 --> 03:11:02.450
IMPLICATIONS EVEN THOUGH IT'S-

03:11:02.517 --> 03:11:04.686
A SHORT TERM I THINK. DR HURLEY

03:11:06.121 --> 03:11:08.223
OVERVIEW OF. THE PROGRAM THAT

03:11:08.290 --> 03:11:09.691
MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND THEN SHE-

03:11:09.758 --> 03:11:10.759
THAT SHE COULD ANSWER MORE

03:11:10.826 --> 03:11:12.627
DETAIL LEVEL QUESTIONS BUT I

03:11:12.694 --> 03:11:14.029
GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THE

03:11:14.095 --> 03:11:15.730
RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION IS WE

03:11:15.797 --> 03:11:17.065
CAN DEAL WITH THAT THROUGH AN

03:11:17.132 --> 03:11:18.233
ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:20.669
SO WE KEEP. TABS ON HOW THE

03:11:20.735 --> 03:11:22.504
MONEY IS USED TO. ON ANNUAL

03:11:22.571 --> 03:11:24.573

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:18.793
OF PROGRESS SINCE POLICY GO.

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.495
WAS STAB. HOWEVER OVER SEVEN

03:12:20.562 --> 03:12:21.596
HUNDRED. DOGS AND CATS STILL

03:12:21.663 --> 03:12:23.431
ENTER OUR STATE SHELTERS ON AN

03:12:23.498 --> 03:12:25.967
ANNUAL BASIS. AND ABOUT FIVE

03:12:26.034 --> 03:12:27.202
HUNDRED OF THOSE ANIMALS STILL

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:28.003
LOSE THEIR LIVES AND OUR

03:12:28.069 --> 03:12:30.272
SHELTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND

03:12:30.338 --> 03:12:30.972
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

03:12:31.039 --> 03:12:32.574
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THAT

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:33.808
BURDEN ON ECONOMICALLY

03:12:33.875 --> 03:12:36.077
CHALLENGED COMMUNITIES. UP AND

03:12:36.144 --> 03:12:38.046
DOWN CALIFORNIA. AND GIVENWHAT

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:40.448
WE KNOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:42.384
THE RELATIONSHIP OF HUMAN

03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:44.119
BEINGS AND ANIMALS. FOR HUMAN

03:12:44.185 --> 03:12:46.221
PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH WELL AS

03:12:46.288 --> 03:12:47.389
FOR THE ANIMALS CELLS THIS

03:12:47.455 --> 03:12:48.523
SHOULD BE SEEN AS A HUMAN

03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:52.494
HEALTH CONCERN. WELL AND- WE

03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:53.929
HAVE A SOLUTION. WE RECOGNIZE

03:12:53.995 --> 03:12:55.196
THAT THE ONGOING USE AN EXTRA

03:12:55.263 --> 03:12:56.798
OF HEALTHY UNTREATABLE ANIMALS

03:12:56.865 --> 03:12:58.967
IN SHELTERS REFLECTS A LACK OF

03:12:59.034 --> 03:12:59.701
ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND

03:12:59.768 --> 03:13:02.237
TRAINING. AS MUCH AS A LACK OF

03:13:02.304 --> 03:13:04.472
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IN SOLVING

03:13:04.539 --> 03:13:05.507
THE FINANCIAL GAP WITHOUT

03:13:05.573 --> 03:13:07.542
SOLVING THE KNOWLEDGE GAP WOULD

03:13:07.609 --> 03:13:09.344
BE INEFFICIENT AT BEST. AN

03:13:09.411 --> 03:13:11.246
UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM

03:13:11.313 --> 03:13:12.614
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FOR

03:13:12.681 --> 03:13:13.848
SHELTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY DON'T

03:13:13.915 --> 03:13:15.050
HAVE THE FUNDS TO EVEN SEND

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:16.885
SOMEBODY TO A TRAINING PROGRAM.

03:13:16.952 --> 03:13:18.687
LET ALONE ACCESS AN EXPERT

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:20.155
CONSULTANT TO COME IN AND

03:13:20.221 --> 03:13:22.657
ASSESS THEIR OPERATIONS. AND SO

03:13:22.724 --> 03:13:24.092
THIS IS CONCEIVED AS A TWO PART

03:13:24.159 --> 03:13:25.961
PROGRAM REALLY TO ADDRESS THAT

03:13:26.027 --> 03:13:28.396
ISSUE. ABOUT 25% OF THE FUNDING

03:13:28.463 --> 03:13:30.031
WOULD GO TO THE SHELTER

03:13:30.098 --> 03:13:31.299
MEDICINES PROGRAM OUT REGION

03:13:31.366 --> 03:13:33.435
TRAINING SERVICES. AND WE WOULD

03:13:33.501 --> 03:13:34.803
PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES THAT

03:13:34.869 --> 03:13:36.705
WOULD BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND

03:13:36.771 --> 03:13:37.739
REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE

03:13:37.806 --> 03:13:40.942
CONFERENCES MAYBE VIRTUAL-

03:13:41.009 --> 03:13:42.711
ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY SINGLE

03:13:42.777 --> 03:13:44.346
CALIFORNIA SHELTER. WE WOULD

03:13:44.412 --> 03:13:46.014
ALSO PROVIDE TARGETED IN DEPTH

03:13:46.081 --> 03:13:47.682
ASSESSMENT FOR AT LEAST A

03:13:47.749 --> 03:13:48.984
HUNDRED SHELTERS OF ABOUT THREE

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:49.617
HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN

03:13:49.684 --> 03:13:50.852
CALIFORNIA WITH THE GREATEST

03:13:50.919 --> 03:13:52.954
IDENTIFIED NEED. AND THEN THE

03:13:53.021 --> 03:13:55.223
REMAINING 75% OF THAT FIFTY

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:56.858
MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO

03:13:56.925 --> 03:13:57.492
DIRECTLY TO GRANTS TO THE

03:13:57.559 --> 03:14:00.195
SHELTERS. SO THE WAY WE

03:14:00.261 --> 03:14:01.629
ANTICIPATE WOULD THIS WOULD

03:14:01.696 --> 03:14:03.031
WORK IS THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:04.799
WOULD BE LINKED. TO THE OUTRAGE

03:14:04.866 --> 03:14:06.634
AND TRAIN SERVICES CLOSELY

03:14:06.701 --> 03:14:07.535
SOCIAL JUST COULD APPLY

03:14:07.602 --> 03:14:09.471
INITIALLY. FOR THE ASSESSMENT

03:14:09.537 --> 03:14:11.840
PROCESS. AND THEN IN THAT

03:14:11.906 --> 03:14:13.508
PROCESS WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER

03:14:13.575 --> 03:14:14.509
TO IDENTIFYING THE AREAS OF

03:14:14.576 --> 03:14:16.077
GREATEST IMPACT. AND WE WOULD

03:14:16.144 --> 03:14:18.279
INVITE GRANT APPLICATIONS TO

03:14:18.346 --> 03:14:19.080
IMPLEMENT THOSE

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:21.349
RECOMMENDATIONS. RATHER THAN

03:14:21.416 --> 03:14:22.517
LEAVING IT TO CASH STRAPPED

03:14:22.584 --> 03:14:24.986
SHELTERS WITH SMALL STAFF STAFF

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:26.187
TO FIGURE OUT FOR THEMSELVES

03:14:26.254 --> 03:14:27.455
WHAT ARE THE MOST LEVERAGE

03:14:27.522 --> 03:14:29.524
CHANGES THAT THEY COULD MAKE.

03:14:29.591 --> 03:14:30.925
SO ESSENTIALLY THE ASSESSMENT

03:14:30.992 --> 03:14:32.627
PROCESS WE DEVELOPED AS WE

03:14:32.694 --> 03:14:34.195
ENVISION IT WOULD PARALLEL THE

03:14:34.262 --> 03:14:36.297
PHYSICAL EXAM THAT WE PERFORM

03:14:36.364 --> 03:14:38.233
ON INDIVIDUAL PASS. THAT'S AND

03:14:38.299 --> 03:14:39.367
THEN THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD

03:14:39.434 --> 03:14:40.568
ALLOW US TO PULL OUT OUR

03:14:40.635 --> 03:14:42.170
VIRTUAL PRESCRIPTION PAD TO

03:14:42.237 --> 03:14:43.338
ALLOW THE SHELTER TO ACTUALLY

03:14:43.405 --> 03:14:45.106
IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:14:45.173 --> 03:14:46.307
THAT WE ANTICIPATE WOULD

03:14:46.374 --> 03:14:47.809
DELIVER LONG TERM LIFESAVING

03:14:47.876 --> 03:14:48.810
IMPACT FOR A ONE TIME

03:14:48.877 --> 03:14:52.047
INVESTMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO

03:14:52.113 --> 03:14:53.014
IMAGINE THAT A ONE TIME

03:14:53.081 --> 03:14:55.517
INFUSION OF FUNDS COULD DELIVER

03:14:55.583 --> 03:14:57.786
LONG TERM CHANGES. I LOOK

03:14:57.852 --> 03:14:59.554

FIGURE OUT SOME SORT OF

03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:05.794
REPORTING. NINE OWNERS

03:15:05.860 --> 03:15:07.962
REPORTING ACTUATION SO THAT

03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:15.670
WORK CLOSELY AS WELL MOST OF

03:15:15.737 --> 03:15:16.304
THE STUFF WE DO IS ON BUT WILL

03:17:19.460 --> 03:17:20.361
PRIORITIES BUT SPENT SPREAD

03:17:20.428 --> 03:17:21.763
ARGUABLY SPREADS RESOURCES MORE

03:17:21.829 --> 03:17:23.565
THINLY NOT TURNED OF APPROACH

BE APPROPRIATE PROTECT.

03:17:57.565 --> 03:17:58.967

APPROPRIATION IS A SO

03:18:00.301 --> 03:18:03.271
SIGNIFICANT- RELATIVE TO THE

PROGRAMS EXISTING BUDGET- WE

03:18:05.073 --> 03:18:06.574
