GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS HR TWENTY EIGHT CALLED ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES. TO IT'S ILLEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED TO LEGALIZE DIRECTORY OF HUMAN NEW USE OF CANNABIS IN OUR STATE. DESPITE THIRTY EIGHT STATES HAVE BEEN LEGALIZE CANNABIS FOR MEDICAL OR RECREATIONAL USE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO AFFIRM HIS AUTHORITY TO CLASSIFY CANNABIS AS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. FEDERAL POLICY DISCOURAGES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FROM PROVIDING SERVICES TO CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE STATES TO SET UP THEIR OWN BANKS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AS THE RESULT TO STATE LEGALIZE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHICH IS EXPECTED BE WORTH ABOUT SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY. STRUGGLE TO FIND BANKING SERVICES AND IS FORCED TO MAKE ALL TRANSACTIONS INCAT. LIMITED ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES MAKES THESE BUSINESSES VULNERABLE TO CRIME AND PUT THE SAFETY OF BUSINESS OWNERS CUSTOMERS AND OUR ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. NEIGHBORHOODS AT RISK AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I'M TO EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE PREVALENCE OF CASH ONLY BUSINESS WILL DO TO OUR COMMUNITIES. PLEASE JOIN ME TODAY IN URGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ALLOW STATES. TO PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES CANNABIS BUSINESSES.

THROUGH FIFTH OFFICIALS FOUNDED ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO WE WORK TIRELESSLY TO IDENTIFY SOLUTION TO OUR MEMBERS TO BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER LICENSE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I THINK I FULLY SUPPORTS AJ ARE TWENTY EIGHTH METHODS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY NEEDS ACCESS TO BANKING NOW. THE RESOLUTION RESOLUTION URGES CONGRESS THAT PRESIDENT TO RESPECT THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHEN THEY APPROVE THE ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACTON OF MEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. BY A VOTE OF OVER FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. THE THIRD OF THEFT AND VIOLENCE IS A VERY REAL ISSUE FOR BUSINESSES OPERATING IN THE CAB OF A SPACE. LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ARE BEING TRANSPORTED US PART OF EVERYDAY BUSINESSES. AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FORCED TO STILL PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS IN CASH. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HAS A TAX WILL DO THIS MONTH THAT IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY WILL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IN CASH. FROM A BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE THIS IS INCREDIBLY TIME CONSUMING LABOR INTENSIVE AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS. IF YOU ARE TWENTY EIGHT EXPRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPONSIBLE REGULATION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. MOVES TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC THE. ELATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND WILL ENCOURAGE GREATER PARTICIPATION THAT SYSTEM TO INCREASE. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT. AND SPONSOR ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE PROCEED WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE ROLE. LEóN I CAN SEE. LIMON WE WON'T HEAR THE CHEN.

ALRIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE SO WE CAN. I WILL BE BRIEF. KATHY VENISON REPRESENTING CMG KHALIFA THEY ARE. WE'RE THE LARGEST ENTITIES IN THE STATE THEY ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AT A OUT INTO. AND HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGED ON THE BANKING ISSUE I AND. YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE THE. KOMPLETT COMPLEXITIES THAT BUSINESSES FACE YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT EMPLOYEES. THEIR ACCESS TO BANKING IS COMPROMISED AS WELL. GETTING HOME LOANS ANY TYPE OF EQUITY LOAN I YOU KNOW THE LANDING IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN BANK ACCOUNTS OF THEIR AFFILIATED WITH THE INDUSTRY. YOU CAN TAKE THE STORY AND JUST. MOVING ACROSS VENDORS. CONSULTANTS ATTORNEYS AND SO FORTH AND I IT IS A IS A TRUE PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF FOLKS THAT MAY NOT BE. AND PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN THE INDUSTRY BUT IF THEIR. TEND TO TANGENTIALLY. A ENOUGH THE TOUCH THE INDUSTRY THERE AT RISK. SO WE APPLIED OF THE ASSEMBLYMAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE ARE VERY EAGER TO SEE HAVING A DECLASSIFICATION OF THE A THE SCHEDULE. AND DAD HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET ON TRACK WITH BANKING AND. NEAR FUTURE. I THINK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. STATE I THE NAME AND ORGANIZATION GETTING A BOMB BEHALF OF WE DROP CANNABIS DELIVERY IN THE ONE BEACH COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THINK. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CAN MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION ALSO INSOFAR. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SCENE EN. I'M TAKING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. NOW COMES THE. THE PHONE NUMBER CHOI. THANK YOU SHARE. I WOULD TO SUPPORT. THIS SUMMER SOLUTION. THIS HAS SIMPLY TO APPROACHING CONGRESS HAVE TO ADOPT THE. YEAH AND THE PASS A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PERMIT THAT BANKING. A CURRENTLY. I WONDER IF THE INDUSTRY IS SET UP ACTIVELY DOING BUSINESS I AND UP BANKING IS NOT ALLOW. HOW? TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS TO HANDLE THE MONEY AND. WHAT KIND OF A LOS? IN THE STATE THE POTENTIAL A REVENUE TO HAVE ANY FIGURES. BY ALLOWING WHAT KIND OF A FINE ASIA OR REVENUE BENEFITS JUST STATE BILL WOULD REALIZE. SO I THINK IT'S FOR THOUGHTS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE AND COLLECT DATA BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL BRINGING BOTH INTO THE FOLD AND THIS IS CERTAINLY. UP A HUGE STEP IN THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE YOU KNOW WE AT THE TRADE ASSOCIATION LOST OUR BANK ACCOUNTS ON IT IT SEEMS TO BE A MATTER OF TIMING RIGHT. SOME FOLKS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT USUALLY WITH THAT YOU KNOW CREDIT UNION. BUT EVENTUALLY THEY FIND OUT THAT YOU WORKING CANNABIS IN YOUR AND YOU GET THE BOOT. RIGHT AND THEN YOU AND SEARCH FOR ANOTHER BANK ACCOUNT AND THEN THAT WORKS FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN EVENTUALLY ONCE MORE. YOU NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO A BANK ACCOUNT SO IT'S IT'S A YOU END UP SORT OF PLAIN YOU KNOW. THIS SORT OF MUSICAL CHAIRS. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WITH. WITH THE BANKS AND IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY. UNITS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR BUSINESS OWNERS AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH A AN EMPLOYEE OF A TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH THE PLAN. YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE IMPACTED YOU KNOW AND SO ON IT IS IT IS QUITE A BIT IT'S A QUITE STRESSFUL AND AND REALLY DOES INTERFERE WITH JUST OUR DAY TO DAY BUSINESS AND. AND REALLY SORT OF PUT US IN A CATEGORY. OF NOT LEGITIMATE AS NOT LISTED AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. AS OF FOR A ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE ARE A LOT OF EACH. OTHER STATES ARE SUCH AS A GROTTO. ó WHICH ARE IN THE SAME IN A SITUATION LIKE OURS SO IDEA DIFFERENT PRACTICES SEWER. AND. ANY DATA FROM THEM. SO I I KNOW THAT COLORADO AND OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED WASHINGTON AND THEY'VE HAD. ON AND OFF SUCCESS IT IF YOU REALLY WANT IT WANNA TALK ABOUT IF YOU TALK TO ANY BUSINESS THAT DEALS IN CASH ONLY. IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO GET THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM SO THAT NOT ONLY THEY PAY THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF TAXES. BUT I THINK. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEFT AND IN. AND MISS APPROPRIATIONS AND THINGS THAT NATURE HAPPENS ALSO WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY NUMBERS NOW BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED IN JANUARY. OF AS FAR AS HOW THIS IS IMPACTED THIS INTEREST INDUSTRY SO FAR. BUT I KNOW IT'S EVEN BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE OTHER STATES TO EVEN ATTEMPT EVEN THOUGH THEY GET SHUT DOWN. THEY'VE EVERYONE'S TRIED EVERY WAY THEY CAN DO TO GET THIS DONE. THANK YOU I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE SO WE NEED TO. F. SUMS OF STREAMLINED OTHERWISE SO STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE POTENTIAL. A TAX REVENUE WE ARE LOSING. SO ONE WAY OR NOT THAT WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THIS THANK YOU.
