ONE OF THE COLUMNIST WHO WROTE OF HIS PASSING WROTE ABOUT THE MAN WHO CHANGED THE CAPITAL. HE DID BRING NEW DIMENSIONS TO THIS INSTITUTION. WE HAVE SOME OF HIS FAMILY HERE. WITH US TODAY. THE BILL HAS WELL AS AN AD MAN. HE ATTENDED UNIVERSITIES IN WASHINGTON. THEN IT STARTED HIS OWN FIRM. THERE WAS A PIONEER IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION. WITH THE VOTERS THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED CALLED COMPUTER CAGING WHILE HE WAS HERE WITH US ADOPTING TECHNOLOGY. THE POLITICAL MATTERS NOW IT IS SOLD COMMON. AND SO WIDESPREAD. BILL WAS ONE OF THE PIONEERS. A TRUE GENTLEMAN. FEARLESS FIGHTER. EVERYBODY DID NOT AGREE. BUT THEY'LL- BUT EVERYBODY RESPECTED HIS PASSION AND HIS COMMITMENT. AND PARTICULARLY. THAT COMMITMENT TO THE INSTITUTION THE SENATE THIS RULES ITS TRADITIONS. AND SENATORIAL COURTESY. HE WAS THE STEADIEST ABOUT THESE MATTERS. I REMEMBER. WE HAD A BIG SENATE PARTY ONE TIME TO THE- MANSION. ELECTED THE YEAR I WAS WAS SENATOR DIANE WATSON FROM LOS ANGELES. NOW SENATOR WATSON AND SENATOR RICHARD XIN WERE ABOUT AS DIFFERENT POLITICALLY AS YOU COULD EVER GET. BUT THE POINT AT THAT EVENT. IT LIFTED ALL OF OUR SPIRITS. WHEN BILL RICHARDSON ASK DIANE WATSON TO DANCE. AND HE WAS A MASTER DANCER ACTUALLY HAD TAUGHT DANCING OVER AND EVERYBODY WATCHED ALMOST IN AWE IS THE WALTZ ACROSS THE ROOM TO POLITICAL OPPONENTS IF YOU WILL BUT THE COLLEGIALITY. AND COURTESY AND RESPECT THAT MARKS THIS INSTITUTION. WAS EXEMPLIFIED IN THOSE MOMENTS ON THAT DANCE FLOOR. IN THAT MANSION. BILL WORKED TIRELESSLY. FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH HE BELIEVED IN. PASSIONATELY HE FOUND THE GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA. ORGANIZATIONS SHE LED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. AND THEY WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OUR CITIZENS. THE BEAR ARMS. HE WAS A STUDENT OF HISTORY. THE HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING IN THIS INSTITUTION AND OF ISSUES. SOME OF HIS SPEECHES WERE KIND OF LIKE A LECTURE ALMOST. YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN. FROM BILL RICHARDSON. IT WAS A PASSIONATE MAN. NEVER UP TIGHT. NEVER RUDE. THE PASSION. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE I THINK. HE HAD. WAS A WRITER WROTE A COUPLE OF. NOVELS WESTERN NOVELS.

THE BIBLE SAYS THAT IN A MULTITUDE OF COUNSELLORS THERE IS SAFETY. AND WHEN I ARRIVED HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I HAD GOTTEN MYSELF INTO. A RUNNING FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN AND ARRIVING INTO THE STATE CAPITOL. AND ONE OF THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE THAT- INSTITUTION HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND ALL AND A LONG TIME.

I THINK CENTER NIELSEN DID A GREAT JOB OF SPEAKING OF HIS LEGACY HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND HIS SERVICE IN POLITICS BUT ONE THING THAT I WANT TO SHARE IS- WHAT HE TAUGHT ME IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LEGACY OF A OF A- OF A PERSON A MAN OR A- WOMAN. THAT'S THE LEGACY THEY'RE LEAVING BEHIND IN. WHAT ARE THEIR CHILDREN DOING. AND OUT WHEN I LOOK AT BILL RICHARDSON'S FAMILY AND SAW NOT JUST HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HIS CHILDREN. AND THE LEGACY OF SERVICE THAT HE POURED INTO HIS GRAND CHILDREN. AND AS WE'RE HEARING THIS MORNING HIS GREAT GRAND CHILDREN. HE REALLY CAUSED ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW I WAS RAISING MY KIDS. AND WHEN I WAS TEACHING THEM.

NOT THE SAME PATTY BERG WE- SHARED OUR LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH BUT ACCORDING TO OUR PATTY BERG SHE WAS NAMED FOR THE PATTY BERG THE GREAT GOLFER- SO. OF MICKEY WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY HER SUCCESS AT SO MANY OF THESE EVENTS LED HER TO TOP THE LG LPGA MONEY LIST FOR. ISN'T FROM NINE SIXTY ONE TEN SIXTY FOUR. AN EXTRAORDINARY RECORD SHE DECIDED TO RETIRE THOUGH AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF THIRTY FIVE. AND DID SO- AFTER BATTLING CHRONIC WRIST AND FOOT INJURIES TOWARD THE END OF HER CAREER BUT NONE THE LESS. SHE CONSIDERED AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THOSE GOLFERS WE ARE E ARE REPUTED TO HAVE A FEW IN OUR PRESENCE TODAY. ISSUE WAS. A FIERCE IN HER COMPETITIVE NATURE AND HER TECHNIQUE AND SKILL BUT SHE IS QUOTED AS HAVING SAID IN A TWENTY TWELVE NEW YORK TIMES INTERVIEW. THE QUOTE THE SECOND GREATEST FEELING THE- IN THE WORLD WAS A HIGH TO WIRE INTO A WELL TRAPPED GREEN. WITH THE ONLY BETTER FEELING BEING THAT OF WINNING. THIS WAS A WOMAN OF TREMENDOUS COMPETITIVE SPIRIT TREMENDOUS SKILL SHE RETIRED AS I MENTIONED AS A YOUNGER WOMAN. THE VERY QUIET PRIVATE LIFE THEREAFTER IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SHE WAS SHOT AND IS TO THE STATE THE ONLY WOMAN WITH A DEDICATED ROOM IN THE U. S. GOLF ASSOCIATION MUSEUM IN LIBERTY CORNER NEW JERSEY. SHE WAS ALSO ELECTED TO THE WORLD GOLF HALL OF FAME IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND THE PGA HALL OF FAME IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHE THOUGH DID NOT ATTEND THESE EVENTS BECAUSE OF HER VERY SHY AND QUIET AND PRIVATE NATURE NONE THE LESS DURING HER PERIOD OF TIME WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER PLAYING ON THE GOLF CIRCUIT. SHE BELIEVED IN PAYING IT FORWARD TAKING INTEREST IN THE CAREERS OF SOME OF THE YOUNGER FEMALE GOLFERS ON THE NATIONAL SCENE INCLUDING LUCY LEE WHO REACH THE WOMEN'S OPEN AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO ENSURE NOT ONLY. IN MEMORY OF A GREAT WOMAN GOLFER BUT ONE OF THE GREAT GOLFERS OF ALL TIME. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.
