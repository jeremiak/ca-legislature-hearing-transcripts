00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.690
THAT- OR ACTUALLY TAKING MONEY

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.225
IN KEEPING THE REVENUE THAT'S

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.860
NECESSARY AND IT'S JUST AN-

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:03.929
UNEQUAL AND UNFAIR IN THE WAY

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:06.364
OF HAS BEEN. APPROACHED IT AND

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:08.333
ALSO THE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.201
TO RESOLVE A PROBLEM OR AN

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:11.803
INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.405
PROPOSED WHEN THIS CAN BE.

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.307
ALLOW FOR THE CONVERSATION THE

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:17.342
DISCUSSION AND THE COMPROMISE

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.376
THIS NECESSARY TO PLAY

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.744
SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT THAT

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:21.546
DOES SO MUCH MORE. THAN WAS

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.048
ORIGINALLY ATICIPATED SO I

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:25.083
JUST THINK THIS IS A GREAT-

THIS. AS WELL AS IT IS

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:31.890
YOURSELF- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:33.959
MULLIN AND- THE STAFF FROM OF

TOGETHER ON THIS THIS GREAT

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:38.997
COMPROMISE OR JUST. HONORED TO

BE A PART OF IT AND- CERTAINLY

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.234
HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

IT TODAY. THANK YOU. ANYONE

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:49.708
ELSE RESTORE CAST. AM HE

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.776
WOULDN'T BE YOU WON'T YOU KNOW

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:54.512
I GET THE SPIN SAY ON REVENUE

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:56.748
FROM THE ON SECONDHOMES SO YOU

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.717
CAN'T TAKE YOUR PROP THIRTEEN

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.685
AND GO UP AND GET A CABIN OR WE

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:04.322
WHAT WE USED TO CALL CAP AND

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:05.490
THE CONCERN IS THE SECOND PART.

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:07.325
THAT THE ALLEY **** CALCULATES

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.594
THE NET LOSS FROM ALL THE

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.996
PEOPLE WHO WERE FIFTY FIVE

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:13.198
YEARS OLD THAT ARE GOING TO BE

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:15.700
TRANSFERRING PROPERTY AND NOT

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.602
PAYING THE PROP. THE D.

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.504
INCREASE VALUE TO PROPERTY TAX

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.107
THAT YOU DO RIGHT NOW- IN I

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:25.543
GUESS THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.414
IS THE- XCELERATED IMPACT ON

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.518
THE- WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:35.754
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF. A

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.622
LOT OF HIGH VALUED HOUSES THAT

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:38.757
ARE IN THE BAY AREA- LOS

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.092
ANGELES THE PEOPLE WOULD SELL

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:44.396
AND MOVE UP INTO- AN AREA

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.930
THAT'S ALREADY STRESS WITH WITH

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.233
DEVELOPMENT- OR AT LEAST SOME

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.935
OF US WOULD WOULD SAY SO. THE

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.137
BUT THEY'RE TALKING THAT THE

00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:54.539
LAW THE IMPACTIS GOING TO BE

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:56.207
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:58.576
LOCAL- SCHOOLS IN LOCAL

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:01.379
GOVERNMENT OVER YEARS. HOW DO

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.548
YOU BALANCE OFF THOSE. THOSE

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.250
THOSE TWO PRESSURES WHEN I SEE

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:06.484
CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE THAT

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.119
THAT'S THAT'S EASY TO GET IN

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:10.388
BUT THE PRESSURE ON. WE ALREADY

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:11.523
HAVE PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.558
FIRE FIGHTING IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:14.793
MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING TO

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.394
TRY TO SUPPRESS FIRE NETWORK

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:19.431
ADDING. AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:22.233
TO GO TO THESE. SHOWS VIEW FULL

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.170
AREAS THERE IS A- A NET GAIN OF

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.771
UP TO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:30.075
OVER TIME. BEAT THE INCREASE

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.810
COMES IN THE VOLUME OF

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:35.213
TRANSACTIONS. I BELIEVE THAT-

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.881
COUNTIES WILL BE MADE WHOLE

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:38.550
PROP NINETY A GUARANTEE THAT

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:39.918
CAT SCHOOLS WILL BE

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.319
APPROPRIATELY FUNDED THERE

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:44.222
WON'T BE AT A LOSS THERE THE

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:46.357
FORMULA IS A COMPLICATED ONE

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.259
BUT IF- THE FOR THE ON THE

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.461
PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:52.430
PROVISION THE SCENE OVER FIFTY

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:55.767
FIVE WHEN THEY MOVED TO A NEW

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.269
RESIDENTS IF THAT IS. OF

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.804
GREATER VALUE THEY WILL

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.640
ACTUALLY BE PAYING A MODEST

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.476
ABOUT MORE IN PROPERTY TAXES.

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.144
BUT IT'S REALLY THE VOLUME OF

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:07.312
TRANSACTIONS AND FREEING UP

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:08.646
THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ADDRESSES

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.882
THE AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY OF

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.917
HOUSING STOCK ISSUE BUT IF YOU

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.752
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THERE IS A

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.988
PROJECTED NET GAIN BUT IT IS IT

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:17.989
IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE'S

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:19.691
LOSSES IN SOME COLUMNS. GAINS

00:29:19.757 --> 00:29:21.893
IN THE OTHER COLUMN BUT IT NETS

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.729
OUT UP TO A BILLION A YEAR IN

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:25.997
THIS FUNDS UNDER FIND

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:27.465
HISTORICALLY UNDERFUNDED FIRE

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.767
DISTRICTS SO THAT'S A THAT'S A

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.269
VALUABLE PORTION OF THIS BUT IT

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.072
ALSO- MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.708
ARE HELD HARMLESS. IN ANY

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:37.976
TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE COUNTY

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:40.945
FOR EXAMPLE THERE WILL BE NO-

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:43.248
I'D NET LOSS CELL I'M CONFIDENT

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:46.384
THAT THIS WILL. GENERATE UP TO

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.652
BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE BUT-

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.220
WHAT DREW ME TO THIS WAS THAT

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.856
TAX FAIRNESS HE'S VERY HONESTLY

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.191
OF THIS WITH THE SECOND THIRD

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:54.859
FOURTH HOMES THAT ARE USED AS-

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.661
VACATION PROPERTIES. THEIR USE

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.496
HAS RENTAL PROPERTIES SO

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.465
ESSENTIALLY YOU CAN INHERIT THE

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:01.633
SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH HOMES

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.067
BUT YOU CAN IT HURT THE TAX

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:06.437
RATE. SO THAT IS WHAT DREW ME

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:09.507
TO THIS MEASURE. AND THE

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.176
FORMULA CAN GET TECHNICAL AND

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.810
CAN GET COMPLICATED IF KERR HAS

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.279
ANYTHING TO ADD SPECIFIC TO THE

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:16.114
QUESTION AROUND. THE PROPERTY

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.782
TAX PORTABILITY AND HOW WE CAN

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.117
ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.353
GENERATING. NEW REVENUES I I'D

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.821
WALK A MILE IN HIS CALM AS WELL.

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:28.760
IF. TWO ANOS WORKS WHERE ALL

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:32.530
THE ACT. HI YEAH BUT A SIMILAR

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:33.631
I CAN SPEAK TO THAT QUICKLY

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:36.701
COLONEL- YES WORKS WERE ON

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:37.168
BEHALF OF THE REALTORS

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:38.436
ASSOCIATION. ORDER THE

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.338
EQUALIZATION DOES TRACKING DATA

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.940
ON THE NUMBER OF THESE-

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:44.008
PROPERTY TAX BASE TRANSIT OCCUR

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:46.911
NOW OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:50.281
IT'S AVERAGE FOUR THOUSAND SIX

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:51.216
HUNDRED TWELVE PER YEAR.

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.450
OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER WILL GROW

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.053
UNDER THIS MEASURE WE DON'T

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:57.055
KNOW HOW MUCH IS IT. OR OR

00:30:57.121 --> 00:31:00.858
TRIPLE- IT IT'S HARD TO TELL-

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.527
BUT EVEN EVEN IF THE DOUBLING

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.362
OR TRIPLING WHICH WE COULD SEE

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.964
NEXT ORDINARY. THE STAFF

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.665
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THE

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.567
AVERAGE WILL PROPERTY TAX LOSS

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.604
ON THE REPLACEMENT HOME IS

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.438
FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:15.240
DOLLARS PER YEAR PER HOME. SO

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.508
WHAT THE CURRENT RATE OF FORTY

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:18.443
SIX HUNDRED TRANSFERS PER YEAR

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:19.777
AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR LOT

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:21.212
THAT'S A LITTLE OVER SEVEN

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:22.714
DOLLARS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.916
PER YEAR STATEWIDE. IN PROPERTY

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:28.019
TAX LOSSES. THE NUMBER THE

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:29.153
NUMBER OF CANCER DOUBLES OR

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.356
TRIPLES ARE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:32.156
TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.658
STATEWIDE IN REVENUE REDUCTION

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:34.993
ALL THAT COMPONENT BASED ON THE

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.728
NUMBERS. IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:38.663
IN BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DATA

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.166
COLUMBIA WE ON THE NUMBER OF

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:44.035
TRANSFERS OF THE PROPERTY BASE.

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.370
I THINK IT'S ALL IMPORTANT TO

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.538
POINT OUT THAT. WELL THERE WILL

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.540
BE LESS PROPERTY TAX PAID ON

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.509
THE REPLACEMENT HOLDEN THERE

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.645
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE. SOLD TO

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.413
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TRANSFER

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.081
THE PROPERTY TAX BASE. THE

00:31:57.148 --> 00:32:00.218
ORIGINAL HOME OF THE OF THE

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:00.652
INDIVIDUAL BY IN THE

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.987
REPLACEMENT. HAVE TO BE SOLD

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:05.623
UNDER THE RULES YOU CAN'T. WHAT

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.659
WE CALL YOUR YOUR PROPERTY TAX

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:09.894
BASE TO A NEW HOME UNLESS YOU

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.763
SELL YOUR ORIGINAL OUT. AND

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:13.197
WHEN THE ORIGINAL HOME IS SOLD

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.199
IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD FOR. MORE

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:16.334
THAN THEM IN THE BASE YOUR

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:17.502
VALUES CAN BE SOBER FOR MARKET

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:18.836
VALUE WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS

00:32:18.903 --> 00:32:20.271
MORE SOTHERE'S GOING TO BE. A

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:22.540
PROPERTY TAX INCREASE ON THE

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.075
ORIGINAL- SO THESE NUMBERS

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:26.210
BEGIN OFFSET EACH OTHER THEY'LL

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:28.746
BE. COURSE THE LESSER TAX PAID

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.381
THAT MIGHT. OTHERWISE BE ON THE

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.416
REPLACEMENT BUT THEY'LL BE MORE

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.650
TAX PAID ON THE ORIGINAL HOME

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:34.152
WHEN THE WHEN THE OLDER SELLS

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:36.487
IT TO BOOT. SHOULDERS ACOSTA

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:38.790
DOWN THERE I THINK YOU KNOW FOR.

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:39.857
BASED ON THE NUMBERS AND STAFF

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:41.459
REPORT FOR EVERY FIFTEEN

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:42.160
HUNDRED HOURS LOSS ON A

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.895
REPLACEMENT ON THE PROPERTY TAX

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:46.030
WILL BE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.432
EUGENE. WHEN THIS WHEN THE

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:50.234
ORIGINAL MISSILE. AND I THINK

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:51.536
IT'S A REMEMBER MULLIN POINTED

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:54.072
OUT THAT YOU DEPENDING ON WHERE

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.673
THE HOMEOWNER CELLS ARE HOME

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.275
AND- IN WHAT COUNTY THAT THAT

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.877
IS LOCATED. AND WHAT COUNTY

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:01.145
THEY MOVED TO THE TRANSMITTER
