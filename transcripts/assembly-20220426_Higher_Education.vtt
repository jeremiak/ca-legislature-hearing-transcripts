GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO OF

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.381
FACED- ACTUALCLASSES- AND THE

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.584
BASED UPON THEIR ABILITY TO PASS

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:44.121
OFF A- AND- A MOVEON IN A SHORT

00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.557
TIME AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. AND

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:50.761
THAT THE- THE- OPPOSING- THE

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:54.265
ORGANIZATIONS- I DO SEE THE-

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.167

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.402
THEMSELVES THE SENATE THE OR SO

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:01.906
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AND THEN

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:05.376
ON I THE NAY- COTTAGE PROFESSOR

ON. OF ENTER FRESH. AND THAT

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:18.823

AND THE RESOURCES- TO REMEDY

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.694

HELP THEM TO SUCCEED. BUT THE

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:34.605
OBVIOUS TO HAS BECOME THE AREA

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.607
IT TAKES TOO LONG TIME AND THE

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.743
SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET OUT OF IT

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.945

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:52.189
FROM THE OPPOSITION- STATEMENTS-

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:54.091
THAT THE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.826
STUDENTS OF FAITH IN THE ART OF

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.463
A REGULAR CLASS THAT TRANSFER

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.798
OVER GLASSES. SO WHAT IS THE

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:04.435
REAL ANSWER- WHEN I TALK TALK

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:05.970
KOREAN LANGUAGE AT THE COMMUNITY

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:09.607
COLLEGES- OBVIOUSLY NO MATH NO

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.475
ENGLISH WASN'T NECESSARY AND

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:14.812
THEY HAVE TO LEARN. THE NEW

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:15.780
FOREIGN LANGUAGE IS ALL. I

00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:19.683
WONDER WHAT BASED UPON THEIR

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.087
DECLARED- THE MAJOR OR WHAT

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:24.421
DIRECTION WHAT THAT THEY WOULD

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.056
LIKE TO SPECIALIZED SO WE CAN

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:28.392
MAKE A SOME CATEGORICAL

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:32.029
REQUIREMENT SO REMEDIAL MATH

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:35.332
ENGLISH MAY BE NECESSARY IF FOR

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.502
LAWYERS OR WHATEVER WE NEED TO

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:41.138
GOOD THINGS. NSIA THEY ARE

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:44.341
TECHNOLOGY TO OVER NEED THE AT

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:49.046
MATH KIA. OF OH OH I'M SORRY

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.515
YEAH. SO YOU YOU CAN SEE IS MAY

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:59.256
SO- IN REALLY NEED A GOOD SHOP-

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:02.493
NOVARRO AND I'M K. OR US REAL OF

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.129
WARREN AND NOT READ. SO YOU WITH

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.664
ABOUT THAT THAT DIRECTION HOW

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.668
YOU CAN. BASED UPON. WHICH DOES

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:12.770
DOES WERE ABSOLUTE- WE AT ALL

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:18.042
THOSE- AT. THAT DIDN'T THAT THAT

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:19.476
- LEVEL ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUR

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:25.349
REYES AND- ALL. SAY WHAT OKAY

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:28.352
PROBABLY A TWO THIRDS OF THE OFF

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.221
. A MAN. AND PUT HIM INTO THE

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:31.922
STATISTIC THAT YOU STATED THE

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:32.923
NUMBER OF. THAT ARE-FEELING IS

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.860
TAKEN OF CONTEXT YOU HAVE TO

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:38.996
REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE MANY

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:41.098
MANY MANY MORE STUDENTS THAT

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:45.469
THAT. THAT DIDN'T MEDIA TO IT IN

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.105
ANSWERABLE US THE WAY YOU LOOK

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:50.474
AT THE P. NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:58.182
THAT NOW PAY OUT OF PLAN. IT ASK

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:01.952
. WE THOSE WOULD HAVE YES PLEASE

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:02.953
PLACE IN OUR MEDIA AND THIS IS

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.489
NOT A THIS IS NOT WITHOUT HELLO

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.024
WHEN SEVEN OH PATH PACK WEEK

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.726
SAID THE COULD BE KALRA. SO

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:11.161
ADDITIONAL UNIT CLASSES TAKEN AT

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:12.930
THE SAME TIME THAT HELPED

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.999
ENHANCE THE LEARNING IN THOSE

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.967
TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES WE HAVE

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:19.370
MONEY FOR TUTORING SO STUDENTS

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.505
CAN GET AT THE SAME TIME WHAT WE

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.807
DON'T SO THEY COULD TAKE THE

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:25.075
TUTORING AND HELP THEM- THAT

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:28.812
HELP- THE- ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN A

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:29.880
TRANSFER LEVEL CLASS WHAT WE

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:32.383
DON'T WANT IS STUDENTS TAKING

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:34.418
REMEDIAL CLASS AFTER MEDIAL

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.254
CLASS AND NOT DOING ANY BETTER

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.789
IN TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES YOU.

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.891
THE DATE IT SHOWS THAT THOSE

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:42.359
STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:45.329
THIS OF THESE REMEDIAL CLASSES-

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.564
DROPPED OUT. OR IF AND THEN THEY

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.899
TRANSFERRED THEY THEY PASSED

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.100
FRANCE FOR LEVEL CLASSES AT A

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:53.137
MUCH LOWER RATE SO- I AGREE WITH

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:56.106
ALL THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE-

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.942
EXPRESSED AND WE THINK THAT

00:42:58.008 --> 00:43:00.144
WE'VE TRIED TO. ADDRESS ALL OF

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:04.581
THE WITH. WITH SEVENTY FIVE I'M

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:07.751
SURE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD YES.

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.586
WHEN I MET. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:11.221
IS SHE RIGHT SO WHEN YOU HEAR IS

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.524
THE LIKE THAT A HIGH THOUSAND

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.024
STUDENTS DID NOT PLASTER

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:16.293
TRANSFER LOW LEVEL COURSES

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.095
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WAS SAYING OF

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:20.731
THESE STUDENTS- WHO WE- JUST

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.633
WOULDN'T SEEN IN TRANSFER LEVEL.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.768
RIGHT WE HAD SOMEONE POPPING.

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:27.771
THEY WERE. STUCK IN BDO RIGHT

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:28.405
NOW THEY WERE SAYING STUDENTS

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.240
TRANSFER LEVEL IT IS TRUE NOT

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:32.910
ALL STUDENTS WILL PASS A

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.211
TRANSFERABLE COURSE ON THEIR

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.180
PERSON M- BUT RESEARCH SHOWING

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:38.983
THAT EVEN FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:44.321
TAKE. AND LEVEL. ON THEIR TAMPA

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:47.691
ARTIST. TAKING LIKELY TO PASSED

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.626
. LEVEL ON THAT SO IT THEN THEY

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.462
HAD STAR IN REMEDIAL AT. AND SO

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.130
TO GET TO HEART OF WHAT HEAR YOU

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:55.065
EXPRESS WHICH IS OF CONCERN- DOT

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.934
CHOI IT'S IT REALLY THE- OF YES

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:57.668
STUDENTS COME WITH DIFFERENT

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:01.739
LEVELS OF PREPARATION- WHAT AB

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.540
SEVEN OH FIVE IS MAKING CLEAR IN

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.977
AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE. UNTIL TO.

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:12.116
CLEAR WHILE. BROUGH BUT WE HAVE

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.450
. THAT HAVE NOT PROVEN MEDIA. IS

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:14.885
NOT THE ANSWER THAT PROBLEM SO

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:17.554
WHAT IS THE M. GETS THE THING.

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.188
OTHER EVEN WITH AB SEVENTY OH

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:19.289
FIVE FOCUS STUDENT SUPPORT IN

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:21.558
TRANSFER LEVEL AND- WE'VE DONE

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:22.960
SOME OF THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:25.229
MEDICAL LEDGES- BUT WE HAVE JUST

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:25.963
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE THERE IS

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.499
SO MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN AND

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:29.500
WILL DO. TO ENHANCE STUDENT

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:30.901
SUPPORTS WELL IN TRANSFER LEVEL

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.636
COURSES ALSO THAT WILL CONTINUE

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:34.772
TO SEE EVEN SOME OF THOSE

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.340
CONCERNING NUMBERS DIMINISH.

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:39.643
THEM IS SUMMARIZE. IT JUST OF.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:44.248
IT ADDS A SENSE OF THE- BOB PASS

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.984
RATE THE- WHEN THEY PLUNGE. THE

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.685
REAR OF COURSE UP- WOULD BE

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:52.523
HIGHER. THAN THROUGH THE

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.992
REMEDIAL CLASSES SO WHO ARE NOT

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.960
GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO US

00:44:57.027 --> 00:45:00.330
AND SELL REMEDIAL CLASSES ALFA.

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:03.133
RESENTED THE UNINTENDED

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.768
CONSEQUENCES SO LET'S GIVE IT A

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:07.638
TRY HERE YOU KNOW I COME FROM IN

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.573
A NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.277
MUST OFFER. I FINISHED MY IN A

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.879
COLLEGE AND INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:18.015
AND A BUT I HAD THE THROUGH THE

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:20.517
MONTHS OF- ENGLISH ORIENTATION

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:23.454
PROGRAM. OUT WITHOUT ANY SUCH

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.123
PREPARATION IF I JUMPED INTO IT

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.892
THE I MIGHT HAVE VALUE I DON'T

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:31.295
KNOW IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A LOT

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:34.398
LONGER SO THE ORIENTATION

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.866
LANGUAGE PROGRAM. I DIDN'T HELP

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.868
US SO I THINK THAT THAT WAS ALL

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.603
REGIONAL INTENT DOUBLE REMEDIAL

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:40.671
CLASSES UP BUT THAT THIS HAS-

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:43.207
DRENCH THE TOO LONG AND THE-

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:45.109
CONSEQUENCES TO WERE NOT THE

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:47.478
REALLY- RESULTING IN A GOOD

00:45:47.544 --> 00:45:50.714
DIRECTION SO- STATISTICALLY-

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.484
PASS RATE WHEN THEY JUMP INTO

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.920
THE ACTUAL CLASSES- DEPENDING

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.455
UPON WHAT CLASSES SAID THEY ARE

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:01.792
TAKING THE SUCCESS RATE. HI

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:05.362
LESTER SOME I GET MY- CORRECT.

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:08.799
AND NOT ALL AND SIMPLE OF. I

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:11.902
HAVE A CUP OF QUESTIONS- SO OH

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:14.705
FIVE. DIDN'T GET RID OF REMEDIAL

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:18.008
CLASSES IS THAT CORRECT. SO

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.210
SEVEN SEVEN OH FIVE WHAT IT DID

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.246
IS ALLOWED FOR USING OF VARIOUS

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:24.848
MEASURES NOT JUST RELYING ON THE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.084
PLACEMENT TEST RIGHT TO PUT

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:32.556
STUDENTS IN IN TWO CLASSES RIGHT

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.558
- AND ONE OF THE REASONS ARE YOU

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:36.293
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.997
UNDERSTAND IS A- THAT. WE

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:42.199
HAVEN'T SEEN- THE COMMUNITY

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:45.335
COLLEGES- SUPPORT MOVES INTO

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:49.840
THIS DIRECTION- ANALYSIS IS

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:51.875
WOULD THAT BE A FAIR STATEMENT.

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.777
THERE'S MANY A COMMUNITY

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.579
COLLEGES THAT HAVE FULLY

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:59.116
EMBRACED OF SEVEN OH FIVE AND

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.083
THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THOSE

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.520
COLLEGES ARE REALLY ASTOUNDING

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:06.690
BUT THERE ARE STILL- GROUPS OF

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.126
COLLEGES THAT HAVE NOT OF FULLY

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:11.828
EMBRACED- SEVEN OH FIVE BUT YEAH

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.263
OBVIOUSLY THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.098
OFFICE YES IT IS IF I CAN ADD TO

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:16.300
THAT I WOULD SAY THE COMMUNITY

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.935
COLLEGE SYSTEM DID FULLY LEAN

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:20.671
INTO IMPLEMENTING EIGHTY SEVEN

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:23.207
OH FIVE TO THE LETTER OF THE

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.775
LAW. INSTANT WITH THE STRICT.

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:25.976
AND WOULD PLACEMENT THAT'S WHY

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.145
YOU'RE SEEING THE ADDITION OF

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:29.780
THE LANGUAGE AROUND ENROLLMENT

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:32.783
IN AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE- SO IN

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.218
SOME INSTANCES IT WAS AN

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:36.320
APPROACH OF WELL THE OPTION IS

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:39.089
THERE A STUDENTS CAN BE PLACED

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.058
THERE- BUT IT IS LEFT OPEN I

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:43.827
WOULD SAY TOO MANY DOORS- TO ONE

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:45.896
STUPID CHOICE SO THAT STUDENTS

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:48.632
WERE STILL IN. IN THESE COURSES

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:52.836
AND IF DIDN'T OR THEY FISH WELL.

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:55.038
THEY WERE THERE WAS LIMITATION

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.306
THE COLLEGES THAT- BUT THERE DE

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:58.242
ROOM FOR. MORE TOWARDS THE

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:59.810
SPIRIT OF THE LAW AND WHAT IT

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:01.078
SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE SO THE

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:03.880
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BILL AND

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.582
SEVEN OH FIVE IS WHAT. THE

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.783
STRONG FOCUS ON NOT JUST

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.285
PLACEMENT BUT ENROLLMENT

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:09.419
ACTUALLY FLAGGING THAT THE

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.622
DESIRE OF THIS BILL IS NOT

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:13.090
SIMPLY THAT STUDENTS HAVE AN

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.958
OPTION- THAT THEY COULD BE PLACE

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.393
BUT THAT UP YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.161
ENSURING. THAT WE ARE COUNSELING

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.030
THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ARE

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:21.765
ROLLING IN THE COURSES THAT ARE

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.267

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.580
FEELING BEHIND THAT- THE

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.149
ACADEMIC SENATE HAS WORKED WITH

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.550

THOSE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.362
BUT WE DO HAVE STUDENTS THAT

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:26.930

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.865
WANT TO TAKE ON SUCH A FULL LOAD

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:30.701
OF HAVING TO TAKE A TRANSFER

OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.952
AND THEY WANT TO EASE BACK IN.

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.988

TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE AND THAT'S

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.717
THE BEAUTY OF WHAT I'M DOING

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.285
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THAT WE

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.187
