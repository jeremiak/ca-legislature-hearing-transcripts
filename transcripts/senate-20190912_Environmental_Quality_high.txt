BUT FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS THERE ACTUALLY IS NO INSPECTION PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EMISSION CONTROLS ARE WORKING PROPERLY AND WE'RE GETTING THE EMISSION LEVELS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO. AND IN FACT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ACTUAL EMISSIONS ON THE ROAD CAN BE UP TO TEN TIMES GREATER THAN THE MISSIONS THAT ARE CERTIFIED SO. THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR YES ALEXANDER CAL STARTS POLICY DIRECTOR JUST FOR A REFRESHER CAL START IS A MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT AND OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE FREIGHT OPERATORS FLEET OPERATORS TRUCK OEMS AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS SO FIRST I WANT TO NOTE I JUST HOW IMPORTANT WE THINK THIS BILL IS AND THAT THE CURRENT LACK OF SMOG CHECKS REALLY RECALL EQUATES TO AN UNFAIR TAX ON THOSE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND AN UNFAIR TAX IN OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS LONGS. AND THE REASON AMENDMENTS TO TWO TEN WE THINK ARE VERY COMMONSENSE POLICIES THAT ALSO INSURANCE PROGRAM AFFORDABILITY AND FAIRNESS I'M AND IT WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ACROSS TRUCK OPERATORS BY INSURING THAT EVERYONE'S HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP AND YOU KNOW REALLY PROVIDING A WORKABLE APPROACH TO TAMPING DOWN ON GROSS POLLUTERS WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY RED TAPE.

INSTEAD THEY'RE OUT HAD TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PUBLIC POWER PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE CREATION OF A NEW SMOG CHECK PROGRAM AND CREATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THE BILL BY THE AUTHORED HER SPONSORS OUR CONCERN IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT IT'S AS COST EFFECTIVE AND FEASIBLE AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE ONE REMAINING CONCERNED. AND THAT'S IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO ENCOURAGE AIR BE TO ALLOW ONSITE MOBILE TESTING AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US WE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE OUR TRUCKS ANDCREATE MORE MISSIONS TO GO TO SOME CENTRALIZED TESTING PLACE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO AIR BEYOND THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE S. OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE STILL POSE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT LIKE. BY MY COLLEAGUE AT CMU A AND REGISTRY AFTER THE SHOW MATH OF THE FARM BUREAU FOR THE SAME REASON. THANK YOU ANTHONY TENHO CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO SHUZHEN. ECHOING THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUE FROM STIMULI. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK EVERYBODY FOR. YOUR TESTIMONY LET'S NOW OPEN IT TO QUESTIONS ARE ARE WONDERFUL CENTER FROM FREMONT. ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF REPORTED TALK ABOUT ASSEMBLY MM INSTEAD ADDED EXEMPTIONS FOR TWO. MORE SPUR SPECIFIED CATEGORIES VEHICLES WHAT WERE THOSE SPECIFIED CATEGORIES I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME IN WAS IT AND WHAT WAS THE- TOTAL WORLD WHAT WAS THE UNIVERSE OF VEHICLES. OUR SERVER CASKEY THERE WERE NO MORE THE EXEMPTIONS ARE ONLY FOR MILITARY VEHICLES AND EMERGENCY VEHICLES. AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES WERE GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT BUT THEY THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES NOT HAVE. OKAY SO THE EXEMPTIONS ARE STILL JUST WITH MILITARY AND EMERGENCY. OKAY THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. SENATE DOLLY. WELL I NOR START. SO I AM I'M IN THIS BUSINESS AND I GAVE I THINK A LOT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS. ON THE FLOOR UNDER AB FIVE. FIRST OFF CTA IS MORE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE- THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR- ASSOCIATION ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FLEET TRUCKS WHICH WOULD LEAST TRUCKS AND- SO THE- THE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THE NEWNESS OF THE TRUCKS. ISN'T AS A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THEM AS IT IS FOR SOMEBODY LIKE MYSELF WHO. HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A BRAND NEW TRUCK. AND SO. IN THIS REGULATION OF IF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ON SO THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF SENSORS ON THESE TRUCKS. AND JUST TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THE THEN THE TRUCK THAT I HAVE THAT IS. CARB COMPLIANT THAT HAS ALL THE. THINGS I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE ON IT FOR IS IN THE SHOP ALL THE TIME BECAUSE OF. A SENSOR GOES OUT OR OR AND IT'S NOT DUE TO THE AIR QUALITY PART OF IT COULD BE. QUITE FRANKLY JUSTICE CENTER WENT BAD AND- TRIPS CODES LILY HUNDRDS OF CODES GET TRIPPED ON THESE TRUCKS AND SO YOU'RE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO. AT THAT CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON. DEAR SAYING THAT TRUCKS GOING TO BE RED TAG OR HAS TO BE TAKEN SHOP IT'S A HUNDRED AND- ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS AND A HUNDRED MILE TRIP TO THE SHOP BECAUSE I'D THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO HAVE THE COMPUTER TO HOOK IN WHICH IS REALLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. TO HAVE ONE IF YOU DO TERM THE REPAIR GUYS HAVE BUT AS FOR ME TO HUNDRED AND TEN MILES TO THE PETERBILT DEALERSHIP THAT MY TRUCK PLUGGED IN. AND A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. AND THEN WHATEVER'S CAN BE THE CENSOR SOMETIMES IT'S- COULDN'T IT CAN BE. THE DRIVER AIR MADE A SENSOR TRIP AND THEN THEY JUST RESET IT. BUT THEY STILL CHARGE YOU SO I THINK THAT PART OF THE BILL IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR. THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LONG WAY FROM WHERE THE TRUCKS GET SERVICED NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. IT CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR QUALITY SYSTEM THAT CAUSES THE TRIBUNAL WHICH THE TRUCK IS RIGHT. RUNNING PROPERLY. SO THE OFFICER THAT IS GONNA BE. THE ISSUE THE COMMERCIAL GUYS ANOTHER THING I. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE DAY IS THAT THESE THESE TRUCKS ARE EXPECTED EVERY NINETY DAYS. EVERY NINETY DAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A C. H. P. STICKER IN YOUR WINDOW THAT. SHOWS TO THEM THAT YOU'VE BEEN INSPECTED. THAT'S THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT. SO. YOUR REQUIRE IN IT IF IT AND THAT'S TYPICALLY. IF WE GO TO IT IF WE GO INTO THE THEY'VE THEY'VE TRIPPED LOOK AT THE CO ANYWAY THE POINT OF IT IS THE STRUCTURE VERY MUCH INSPECTED. NOT ONLY BY THE DRIVER EVERY DAY IT'S REQUIRED THAT YOU DO IT. A PRE TRIP INSPECTION. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NINETY DAY INSPECTION BY A COMMERCIAL OFFICER OR GO THROUGH A SCALE WHERE THEY CAN CERTIFY THAT. NUMBER TWO. WHEN THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THIS BILL WE'RE CHARGING US MORE MONEY YOU'RE GIVING MORE POWER TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I JUST THINK THIS IS. GONNA BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SMALL SMALLER GUYS. LIKE MYSELF OF EVEN MORE HARDSHIP AND I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY IN A THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME MEETING THE TEAR FOR. COMPLIANCE IS AND IT IN THESE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS AND THEY DON'T WORKED OUT WELL. DIAZ WE THEY WENT FROM. OF MOTHER SYSTEM TO WHAT WE CALL A DEAF SYSTEM WHICH IS. IS ACTUALLY PUTTING YOUR RIA. INTO THE SYSTEM TO HELP BURN AT A HIGHER RATE. WHICH WERE NOT EVEN IT EATS UP THE EXHAUST PIPES BY THE WAY SO I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT- BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AIR AND MAYBE NOT. THE OTHER PARTS OF THAT THAT BECAUSE WE FORCED MANUFACTURERS TO MEET MEET A STANDARD. SO FIRST SEVERAL THOSE REASONS IS MONICA WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO. REGULATE FOR ONE IS GONNA BE A HARDSHIP ON PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PILED ON AS AN DRIVE THE COST OF FREIGHT UP. IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THOSE REASONS OF THE OPPOSING THE BILL. YES ENERGY IS IT POSSIBLE HE DIVERSE YES ABSOLUTELY SO ONE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WE TOOK AS YOU HEARD THIS WAS IN ORDER WHICH COMMITTEE BUT WE YOU KNOW YOUHAVE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS FOR FIX THE TICKET. THE H. Q. EMPTY HAS COMMITTED TO US THAT THEY WILL DO ON SITE TESTING THAT THEY WANT TO DO ON SITE TESTING BECAUSE WE DO UNDERSTAND FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF DRIVING HUNDRED AND TEN MILES TO SET TEST CENTER IS THAT FEASIBLE AND IN THAT ISN'T THE GOAL OF THE OF THE BILL AT ALL. YOU KNOW I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY TO MAKE IT FOR THE SMALL GUY OF A WAS IS EASY AS POSSIBLE BUT AS FEASIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK IN PART OF IT WE MAY JUST HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE BUT I DO KNOW THAT. THEY CAN BE IS TRYING TO DO ON SITE TESTING BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD AS WE'VE SAID THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM WE DID CHANGE IT FROM FORTY FIVE DAY FIX THE TICKET TO A SEVENTY FIVE DAY FIX THAT TICKET BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR FARMERS AND GROWERS WAS THAT. THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT DURING THE SEASON WHEN THE HARVESTING THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS WAS REASONABLE I THOUGHT IT WAS REASONABLE BUT WE. WE HEARD THOSE CONCERNS SO WE CHANGED IT TO SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. MISTER CHAIRMAN YESTERDAY I JUST AMEND MY ANSWERS CENTER WACO SKI BECAUSE I DID LEAVE OUT ONE THERE IS A LIMITED FOUR YEAR EXEMPTION. FOR NEW VEHICLES MEETING THE- OPTIONAL WILL KNOCK STANDARD SET BY A R. B. THE OTHER. NEW CAR THAT THAT'S RIGHT THAT THE CLEANEST TRUCKS WOULD GET FOR YEARS WE LOOK AT THE MOMENT CENTER YES I WILL OKAY. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS YES DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ONE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PREVIOUSLY HIGHLIGHTED WHICH I SHOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY HIGHLIGHTED IN MY TESTIMONY WAS THAT THIS BILL APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE VEHICLES AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THEY WILL HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE AND WE HOPE THAT THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES COMPETITIVENESS FOR CALIFORNIA TRUCKERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THEM ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES WHERE IS. A LOT OF THE GROSS POLLUTERS ARE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. SO WITH THE IMPACT ON THE IN STATE. YEAH SEVEN FIVE OUT. IN STATE SO WHAT WHERE YOU'RE SITTING AT WITH THE WELL I WANTED SO I READ I READ IT EVERYTHING THAT MY CACUS GAVE ME ON THIS BILL. AND SO. I READ IN YOUR THAT IS THIS BILL'S GOING TO ACTUALLY. WE'RE GOING TO THAT IS A MAN'S. SO WE HAVE INTERSTATE COMMERCE LAWS FOR ONE THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS BILL FACTS THAT MAYBE AN ATTORNEY CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THAT EARLY DOESN'T WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM I KNOW THAT THE CURRENT I THINK THE CURRENT LAW WAS FOR ALLOWED TO REGULATE. BM FOLKS ON OUR ROAD HERE. IN THE STATE YEAH RIGHT BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE SO THEY'RE- IT'S LIKE. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL BE TREATED THE SAME AS THE ESTATE TRUCK SO THERE'S NO DISCRIMINATION AND SO THAT PASSED. THERE WAS A LOT I THINK WE'RE OPERATE. I'M TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH A THERE'S A LOT LAWS IN THIS. CATEGORY AND I DON'T TRACK OUT OF STATE. SO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH OUT OF STATE AND INS INTERSTATE. LAWS BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WAS I THINK UNDER THE LAW WE HAVE NOW IS SEVENTY FIVE YOU COULD COME IN FOR SEVENTY FIVE HOURS. THE WAS THE RULE. YOU EITHER COME FROM OUT OF STATE YOU CAN BE IN IN OUR STATE PERCENT OF OUR LEGAL CAR CROSSES STATES EVERY FIVE HOURS AND BACK IN. AND SO IT REALLY DIDN'T HELP US. KEEP OUT THE TRUCKS FROM OTHER STATES. SO CORRECT WASN'T A VERY COOL SO NOW IN ORDER TO HAVE AN OPERATOR'S PERMIT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU MUST PASS A SMOG CHECK. I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE NO OKAY MERGED CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I DID JUST WANT TO. REGISTER OUR CONTINUED OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS TO DEAL WITH MOBILE TESTING. DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. PROVIDE MOBILE TESTING OPTIONS THAT ARE TRULY. ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE FOR THE LOW USE TRUCKS AND THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT AND WE- WE HOPE WE HAVE HOPE THAT AMENDMENT WOULD BEEN TAKEN TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AS THEY WERE NOT MORE SO. AND AS I STATED BEFORE THE A. R. B. THAT IS THEIR PLAN AND THAT IS PART OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND NOT JUST FOR MY- I WAS. IF YOU NEED TO SORRY I'M SORRY. THAT MEANS OF COURSE.
