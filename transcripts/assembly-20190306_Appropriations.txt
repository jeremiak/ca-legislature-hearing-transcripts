HI GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB ONE FORTY SEVEN THE WAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND SOFT SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A COMPREHENSIVE AND BOUNCE SET OF POST WAY FOR TAX COLLECTION RULES IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE CONSUMER. SMALL BUSINESS AND THIS SO IN THREE WAYS. FIRST -- IT PROVIDES LEAF RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESS BY INCREASING THE ECONOMIC NEXUS THRESHOLD FROM THOUSAND AND IT ELIMINATES THE TWO HUNDRED OR MORE SEPARATE TAP TRANSACTIONS THRESHOLD ENTIRELY. THIS PROVISION ALSO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX. AND FEE ADMINISTRATION BY LIMITING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO REGISTER AND COLLECT FROM TRULY SMALL OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES WEREN'T CIRCUMSTANCES. THE COSTS OF COLLECTION MAY OUTWEIGH THE REVENUE GENERATED. SECOND AB ONE FORTY SEVEN RECOGNIZES THE REALITIES OF TODAY'S ECONOMIST ECONOMY BY REQUIRING ONLINE MARKETPLACES TO COLLECT SALES TAX AND USE TAX ON BEHALF OF THEIR THIRD PARTY RETAILERS. FINALLY AB ONE FOR SUMMER PROMOTES CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY FIRE CRYING RETAILERS TO COLLECT AND REMIT LOCAL DISTRICT TAXES ONCE THEY SELL OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ELIMINATING THE BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS TRACK SALES IN EACH DISTRICT. WITH THAT I WOULD NORMALLY DO YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING -- TREASURE MáS CONS BUT I'D. THE BILL'S SPONSOR BUT SHE'S STUCK IN TRAFFIC TO OUR HI MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS -- I'M CASEY O'CONNOR I'M THE TREASURER FIONA MáS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR SHE IS RUSHING OVER HERE BUT WE GOT TO GO WITH THE COMMITTEE SO I'LL JUST SAY THAT. SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS ACTIVELY SINCE YOU THAT THE BOY THAT THERE WAS AN UNEVEN -- PLAYING FIELD FOR BUSINESSES THAT WERE BROKEN WATER IN STATE AND BUSINESSES THAT WERE SELLING EVEN THROUGH MARKETPLACES AUDITOR'S OR INDEPENDENTLY ONLINE. INTO CALIFORNIA WE JUST -- ARE HAPPY AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR ASSEMBLY WOMAN BURKE AND CENTER MCGUIRE FOR CAMPING THIS ISSUE. AND ACCORDING TO A MARCH TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT BY CAPITAL FORUM CALIFORNIA LOST THE MOST OF ANY STATE IN FOR GUN SALES TAXES WITH MISSING SALES TAX REVENUES OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION.

WE REPRESENT THIRD PARTY SELLERS WHO SELL THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS -- WE WANT TO ALSO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- FOR FOR ANNOUNCING AT THE ASSEMBLY REVENUE TAX HEARING HER DESIRE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS. WHO ARE CAUGHT UP IN SOME PROBLEMS -- WHO ARE BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE FOR BACK TAXES PENALTIES AND INTEREST -- THAT SEEMS TO BE CONTRARY TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS AND I'LL CONCLUDE. BY SEN -- QUOTING IT A PERSON WHO HAS POSSESSION OF PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER. AND ALSO THE POWER TO CAUSE TITLE. TO THAT PROPERTY TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PERSON WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ACTION ON THE PART OF ITS OWNER. AND WHO EXERCISES SUCH POWER IS A RETAILER WHEN THE PARTY TO WHOM TITLE IS TRANSFERRED IS A CONSUMER. TAX APPLIES TO HIS GROSS RECEIPTS FOR SUCH A SALE YET -- THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS ARE BEING ASKED BY CD TFA THE PATH TO PUT PAY BACK TAXES.
