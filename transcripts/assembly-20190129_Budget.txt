SEVENTY THREE AND WILL LAST FOR DEPARTMENT MINUS TWO PERCENT WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU MY NAME IS VAGUE THIS ONE OFTEN AND I SERVE AS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BUDGET ACT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS ABOUT THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT'S HERE BEFORE YOU -- THE FIRST IS THAT THIS IS REALLY AN EMERGENCY PACKAGE IT DEALS WITH ISSUES LIKE WILD FIRES EMERGENCY RESPONSE IMMIGRATION AND THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER AS WELL AS DRINKING WATER EMERGENCIES THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT AS YOU KNOW AFFECT THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF GOVERNMENT AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE ARE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU THAT WE COULD PUT FORWARD A PACKAGE EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL LOOK LEGISLATIVE COOPERATION JUNE WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T WAIT THAT ON ALL THESE ISSUES WE SHOULD ACTUALLY ACT RIGHT NOW THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS PACKAGE IS THAT AS ALL OF YOU KNOW -- IT CAME TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY -- THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM HAD SOME IDEAS -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ASSEMBLY STAFF AS WELL AS THE SENATE STAFF AT ALL REALLY CAME FORWARD IN THE LAST WEEK SO I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH NICOLE BASS CLASSES -- AND CHASE INSISTING THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE FOR HELPING TO CLOSE THIS DEAL LAST WEEK AND GET IT READY FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY SO WHAT'S IN THIS EARLY BUT REALLY TWO ITEMS BEFORE YOU THERE IS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS AMENDING THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT WAS PASSED LAST JUNE -- AND THEN THERE'S THE TRAILER BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY THREE SO I'LL GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE IN TURN THE FIRST ITEM I WANTED DISCUSSING ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY TWO IS THE PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL THIS IS FOR AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS JUST BEFORE THE HEARING THIS IS TO BACK FILL COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FOR PROPERTY TAX LOSSES THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FIRES THAT HAPPENED LAST NOVEMBER WE ARE PROPOSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL OF YOU ATTACK FULL FOR ANY PROPERTY TAX LOSSES FOR BUTTE COUNTY LAKE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY FOR THE FIVE OF THOSE COUNTIES -- WE'RE PROPOSING TO BACK FILL FOR ANY LOSSES INCURRED IN THIS BUDGET YEAR WITH INITIALLY PROPOSED DOING SO IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WE THOUGHT GIVEN THE PRESSURES THAT NINETIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO WAIT AND WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW AND FINALLY FOR BUTTE COUNTY AND FOR LAKE COUNTY GIVEN THE PARTICULAR DEVASTATION THAT THOSE COUNTY SEVEN YARD WE'RE PROPOSING A THREE YEAR PROPERTY TAX BACK STILL THAT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE CURRENT YEAR BUT FOR THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND FOR THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THE SCHOOL SHARE OF ANY LOSS TO THE PROPERTY TAX LOSS IS BACK FILLED AUTOMATICALLY BY THE STATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT PROPERTY TAXES FIND WITHOUT THIS BACK FAIL COUNTIES ANOTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SUFFERING A LOSS AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THEY'RE COPING WITH THE AFTER EFFECTS OF THESE FIRES -- SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY AT SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE WANTED TO GET THAT MOVING RIGHT AWAY THE SECOND ITEM AB SEVENTY TWO THAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS IN THE BROADER AREA OF EMERGING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WHAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH WITH THIS MOST RECENT FIRE SEASON AS WELL AS THE FIRES BEFORE THEN IS THAT BUILDING COMMUNITY RESILIENCY ESPECIALLY AMONG VULNERABLE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT INCLUDE SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHERS WHO REALLY BEAR THE BRUNT OF ANY EMERGENCY EVACUATION OR OTHER SITUATION I'M REALLY NEED OUR HELP AND THAT MEANS BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE'RE PROPOSING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE HAD INITIALLY SLATED IN OUR BUDGET BUT WE WANT TO GET OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW AND WE DIVIDED INTO TWO BUCKETS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH INTO CAL VOLUNTEERS TO BEGIN A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN TO BUILD RESILIENCY AND THESE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND MAKING SURE IN PARTICULAR WITH SMALL NORMAL POPULATIONS WERE REACHING THE PEOPLE WHO WE NEED TO REACH SO THAT EVERYONE IS PREPARED BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT EMERGENCY WILL CALM THE SECOND BUCKET OF THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD GO TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT WOULD REALLY BE DESIGNED TO FLOW AS GRANTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SEEKING TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES ON THEIR OWN AND BUILD RESILIENCY OFF OF LOCAL LEVEL AND SO I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT BOTH PORTIONS OF THOSE THE THIRD PACKAGE UP THIRD ITEM OF THIS PACKAGE THAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS A TEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND LOAN TO SECOND WHICH IS THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT THIS IS THE ACCOUNT THAT THE STATE GENERAL USES TO FIND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THAT IN AN EMERGENCY PEOPLE PEOPLE CAN CONTACT THE NINE ONE ONE OFFICE AND THEN WHEN THOSE NINE ONE ONE CENTERS ARE EVACUATED AS WE SAW IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE SITUATION AT THE ORACLE DAMN TWO YEARS AGO THOSE EMERGENCY CALLS CAN BE REROUTED AND MAKING SURE THAT AN EMERGENCY PEOPLE CAN REACH THE PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO REACH IN GOVERNMENT AND AS WE DISCUSSED THAT OF COURSE IS A CORE COMPETENCY TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO MOVE US TO A NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO BUILD DISCUSSED WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN START RIGHT NOW WITH THE EMERGENCY NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD REDUNDANT REDUNDANCIES INTO OUR MICROWAVE NETWORK AND MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THE NEXT NEXT EMERGENCY CALMS THOSE REDUNDANCIES ARE THERE SO THAT OUR NETWORK IS MORE SECURE THE FOURTH ITEM I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS PACKAGE -- SURROUNDS IMMIGRATION -- MANY OF US ARE AWARE OF IT THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER AND SHELTERS THAT ARE RUN BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PARKED IN FUNDED BY STATE FUNDING ARE BEING OVERWHELMED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME THROUGH THOSE AREAS OFTEN STAYING FOR JUST A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THEY CONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STATE BUT IT IS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE THAT NEEDS ARE ASSISTANCE I HAVE THE GOVERNOR HAS HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU AND MANY MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF HAS TRAVELED DOWN TO THE BORDER UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY AND FOR IN -- FOR THE FUNDING FOR THE BORDER THIS IS MONEY THAT NEEDS TO GO OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED FOR IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND WE EXPECT IT SOON IF AND WHEN THIS PACKAGES ENACTED SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AMOUNT WILL FLOW OUT THE DOOR RIGHT AWAY GREAT THANK YOU CAN WE SEE THIRTY QUESTIONS ON AB SEVENTY TWO THE QUESTIONS WHICH GOT JUST A

ACCESS TO FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THE HIGHEST EVER WEBER HIGHEST EVER LEVEL OF INVESTMENT K. TWELVE UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND LARGE ON GOING INCREASES AND YOU SEE CSU A SECOND YEAR OF FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR A FULL TIME FOR YOUR STUDENTS -- WE THINK THE EDUCATION PART OF THIS BUDGET -- CAN MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES -- INCREASES AND CAL WORKS PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THAT CAN REALLY SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S HARD WORKING FAMILIES NOT THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THE NEW INVESTMENTS IS IN HEALTH CARE THIS BUDGET EXTENDS MEDI CAL TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX ON THERE'S A BIG NEW INITIATIVE ON PHARMACEUTICALS AND HOW WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF THOSE DRUGS -- BIG INVESTMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH BOTH PROVIDERS AND ACCESS TO CARE WE ALSO ELIMINATE THE AS A SIDE CASH OUT POLICY WHICH MAKES SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR A SOCIETY WITHOUT LOSING ACCESS TO COW FRESHEN OTHER BENEFITS UNDER THAT PROGRAM ALSO WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE'RE COMMITTING TO ON GOING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN IMMIGRATION FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FIVE MILLION OF WHICH YOU JUST VOTED ON -- JUST THIS MINUTE THE THIRD POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET WHEN IT COMES TO NEW INVESTMENTS IS AN HOUSING HOMELESSNESS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN HOMELESSNESS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN HOUSING HAPPY TO GO INTO DETAIL BUT WE THINK THESE WILL REALLY START TO CHANGE THE GAME THE FOURTH IS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE EARLY ACTIONS THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE NINE A ONE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR FOR FUEL REDUCTION NEW MONEY FOR AIRCRAFT TO COMBAT WILDFIRES FOR TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR EMERGENCY SYSTEMS AND ALSO INCLUDE SOME MONEY FOR THE WELLNESS OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WOMEN OUT THERE ON THE FRONT LINES FOR DAYS EVEN WEEKS AT A TIME AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT INCLUDES A LOT ON ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS INCLUDING OUR ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM FOR CAP AND TRADE MONEY -- WITH A FOCUS AS WELL IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON HEALTHY SOILS AS WELL AS APPRENTICESHIPS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSITIONING INTO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE ITSELF TO THINGS THAT I THINK THEIR MANSION IS NUMBER ONE A WERE PROPOSING A NEW OFFICE OFFICIAL INNOVATION TECH TRANSFORM DIFFERENT OFFICE OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVED ME NOW THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US NO MATTER WHAT PARTY AND THE SECOND THING I'LL MENTION IS AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CENSUS OUT REACH WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS COMING OUT BECAUSE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET EVERY PERSON COUNTED TO HAVE A REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE ALLOCATED BASED ON POPULATION OR REFLECTING AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT AND WITH ALL THIS ALL SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S STILL JANUARY ITS STATE TWENTY TWO OF THIS ADMINISTRATION WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING REVENUES IN THE FISCAL PICTURE WHEN WE ALL GET TOGETHER AGAIN IN APRIL AND NINE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE MISSED CHIU REPRESENT ALEJO'S OFFICE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING HANDED OUT OUR HAND OUT WHICH I'LL JUST BE SPEAKING FROM TO GIVE SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET JOURNEY TO THE FIRST PAGE WE DO OUR OWN HIGH LEVEL ASSESSMENT OF THE BREAKDOWN OF WHAT WAS AVAILABLE IN DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES AT THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS -- JANUARY BUDGET AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SPENDING REQUIREMENTS CASELOAD CHANGES CHANGES I'M PROGRAM COSTS A NEW LEGISLATION AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ABOUT TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO ALLOCATE THE FIGURE ON THIS PAGE SHOWS YOU ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF HOW THAT MONEY WAS DISTRIBUTED AS YOU CAN SEE ABOUT HALF WAS ALLOCATED TO PAYING DOWN DEBTS AND LIABILITIES A QUARTER TO NEW ONE TIME PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING AND THEN THE REMAINDER WAS SPLIT ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN DISCRETIONARY RESERVES AND ON GOT NEW ON GOING SPENDING TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE THIS TABLE PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS NEW PROPOSALS FOR NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING AS AS AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THE LARGEST PROPOSAL WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS TO PROVIDE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA A ROUGHLY THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT COLA TO INCREASE THE PER PEOPLE RATES I'LL JUST OFFER SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON A FEW OF THE ITEMS ON THIS TABLE STARTING WITH DEBT LIABILITIES THE GOVERNOR AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TO GO TO PAINT ON THESE THAT LIABILITY IS A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE WOULD GO TOWARDS PENSION PAYMENTS THERE IS ONE TRADE OFF TO HIGHLIGHT HERE SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR ON PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO CAL STIRS -- FROM STATE RESOURCES A BUT TO PAY DOWN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHARE OF LIABILITIES AS THE LEGISLATURE WILL RECALL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE WAS A FUNDING PLAN ADOPTED TO ADDRESS THE END OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND CAL STIRS AND DIVIDED THAT LIABILITY BETWEEN THE STATE AND SCHOOLS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DEVIATE SOMEWHAT FROM THAT PLAN BY PAYING A PORTION OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHARE ALSO ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PROPOSALS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR SAID LIABILITY -- PACKAGE IN THE COMING WEEKS WILL BE -- ISSUING REPORTS LOOKING AT THESE PROPOSALS AND TRYING TO EVALUATE -- WHICH ONES GET FOR ITS BUCK IN THE BEST LONG TERM SAVINGS AND EXAMINING WHETHER THEIR ALTERNATIVES THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY STATE SAVE THE STATE MORE MONEY ON RESERVES THIS NUMBER ACTUALLY WITH A TWO POINT NINE BILLION TO ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS ARE THIS IS THE DISCRETIONARY AMOUNT OF -- RESERVES UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS NUMBER IS LIKELY A BIT LOWER ONCE ACCOUNTING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL SETTLE UP PAYMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT NOT REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENTS MOVING TO EARLY EDUCATION -- I THINK -- MISTER VISWANATHAN ALREADY MENTIONED -- THE EXPANSION OF OF PRESCHOOL TO ALL LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD WE FIND THIS TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH AS THESE CHILDREN -- THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THESE CHILDREN BENEFIT THE MOST IN THE LONG TERM FROM THESE TYPES OF OF PROGRAMS ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STARTING WITH CAL WORKS THE -- ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO CAL WORKS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE IMMINENT AND AND THEN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION SIMPLY PROVIDES AN ACROSS THE BOARD GRANT INCREASE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT NOT ALL FAMILY SIZES WOULD NECESSARILY BE AT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS THE TARGET THE LEGISLATURE HAD SET LAST YEAR ALSO WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- MAINTAINS THE SEVEN PERCENT SERVICE REDUCTION OF RESTORATION -- THAT WAS COUPLED WITH THE MCO TAX BUT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT CONTINUE THE MCO TAX AS PART OF ITS BUDGET PACKAGE LASTLY ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROPOSAL TO INSTITUTE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY AND CUP AND COUPLE THAT WITH ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES ON THE HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE WORKS A LITTLE BIT OF CROSS PURPOSES IN PARTICULAR IF THE PENALTY IS DESIGNED CORRECTLY REVENUE SHOULD DECLINE OVER TIME AS INDIVIDUALS MAINTAIN OR GAIN COVERAGE THIS COULD CREATE SOME VOLATILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SUBSIDIES FOR FOLKS PURCHASING INSURANCE ON THE MARKET OVER TIME SO THE LEGISLATURE WILL JUST WANT TO CONSIDER HOW TO ME KEEP THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING STABLE OVER TIME THE LAST POINT I'LL JUST REYES IS ON THE REVENUE PROPOSAL SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CONFORMITY POSITION UP PROP UP EXCUSE ME PROPOSALS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO COUPLE THESE -- TOGETHER TO REACH A REVENUE REVENUE NEUTRAL PACKAGE ACHIEVING THIS LIKELY WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT -- AT DEVELOPING EIGHT CONFORMITY PACKAGE BASED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FEDERAL CHANGES TO TAXES TO REACH A PARTICULAR REVENUE TARGET WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING AND WE RECOMMEND SPLITTING THESE PROPOSALS AND CONSIDERING THEM SEPARATELY THEY BOTH HAVE MERIT BUT WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE I'LL JUST PROVIDE SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIRST THE GOVERNOR IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF POLICY PRIORITIES EARLY MANY OF THESE ARE OUTLINES OF OBJECTIVES OF THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO REACH THE ADVANTAGE FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT ITS MARK ON THESE POLICIES AND FORM AND FORM THEM IN A WAY THAT ALIGNS WITH ITS PRIORITIES MANY OF THE PRIORITIES THE GOVERNOR HAS HAS -- BROUGHT UP IN HIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALIGNED WITH REACHED WITH RECENT LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE SECOND COMMENT ALL MAKE ON ON THE BUDGET STRUCTURE IS ABOUT THE ONGOING COSTS THE ONGOING COSTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR GOING TO THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE YEAR AFTER THAT SOME OF THESE COSTS COULD GROW HOWEVER FOR INSTANCE DISASTER COSTS WHICH ARE LARGELY -- CONSIDER ONE TIME IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE IN RECENT YEARS PROVED TO BE MORE OF AN ONGOING COSTS SO THIS COULD INCREASE THE OVERALL ONGOING COST IN THE BUDGET -- AND MOREOVER -- THERE ARE GOING RESOURCES AVAILABLE MAYBE SOMEWHAT CHANGING AND ALL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND REVENUES AT THE END OF MY COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET STRUCTURE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO -- DEDICATES A SMALLER PROPORTION OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TOWARDS RESERVES COMPARED TO RECENT BUDGETS PART OF THAT IS DUE TO A NEW INTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION TWO THAT NECESSITATES A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT INTO THE BUDGET SUB STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BUT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT THIS BRINGS UP IS WHAT ARE THE RESERVES BEING DESIGNED FOR SO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES ESTIMATED TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY OUR OFFICE HISTORICALLY CONSIDERS THE SOME OUT TO BE THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN TO COVER THE COSTS OF ONGOING -- PROGRAMS BUT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT THESE RESOURCES WILL WILL ALSO BE CALLED UPON TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS SO ONE OF POINT WE WOULD -- UP DIRECT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH RESERVES WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BOTH ADDRESS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE COSTS RELATED WITH A DISASTER SIMULTANEOUSLY WELL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT DEDICATE AS MANY RESOURCES TO DISCRETIONARY RESERVES IT DOES AS I MENTIONED ALLOCATE A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF RESOURCES TO PAYING DOWN DEBT LIABILITIES WHICH DOES IN THE LONG TERM REDUCE THE BUDGET AND PUTS THE THE BUDGET IN A BETTER CONDITION WELL THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT HAS A SIGNIFICANT BALLOTS TO ADDRESS -- THE NON SCHOOL SIDE OF THE BUDGET THERE IS NO RESERVE AT THE STATE LEVEL CURRENTLY FOR SCHOOLS PROPOSITION TWO DID CREATE A STATE LEVEL RESERVE FOR SCHOOLS BUT THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT YET REQUIRED THERE TO BE A DEPOSIT INTO THAT ACCOUNT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SAVING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT IT IS STATE LEVEL THERE IS NOT ANY DEDICATED RESERVES FOR THEM IF THE LEGISLATURE ANTICIPATED WANTING TO USE FUNDING WITHIN ITS OTHER WITH A RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR SCHOOLS IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HAVING A HIGHER OVERALL LEVEL OF RESERVES MOREOVER WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEED THERE'S VERY LITTLE ONE TIME SPENDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT THERE IF IS IF THERE IS A YEAR TO YEAR DECREASE IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEED THERE COULD BE IMPACTS TO THE ONGOING PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS MY LAST COMMENT WILL JUST WILL BE ABOUT THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THE GOVERNOR'S REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO OURS VERY VERY CLOSE TO OURS AND THAT SAID BOTH OF OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES WERE PUT TOGETHER BEFORE THE DOWNTURN IN THE MARKET AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THERE IS REST RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL MARKET WE ALSO ARE SEEING WEAKNESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER PAYMENTS WHICH ARE PAYMENTS BY HIGH INCOME EARNERS ON THAT CAME IN THIS JANUARY WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE DAYS BUT WE'VE REALLY SPROUT THE TAIL -- UNDER OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES THIS AFFECT OF THE LOWER MARKET -- AND THE WEEK OF JANUARY WOULD LIKELY ONLY REALLY BRING DOWN THE ONE TIME AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET THIS IS BECAUSE UNDER OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES WE ASSUMED VÀ SLOW GROWTH IN THE STOCK MARKET CONSEQUENTLY THERE ISN'T A LARGE ON GOING AFFECT OF THIS LOWER LEVEL ON THE MARKET THERE IS SOME AFFECT A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT NOT IT'S NOT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE THE SIZE OF THE WHAT WE'RE STATES CURRENTLY SEEING IN THE SHORTFALL IN THE REVENUES IF YOU THINK UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK -- THE ONGOING AVAILABLE RESOURCES ACTUALLY ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE THEY HAD LOWER PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING THAN WE DID DUE TO BIRTH REDUCTIONS IN THEIR MEDI CAL COSTS SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE REASONABLE FOR ONGOING SPENDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR THERE ARE REVENUE ESTIMATES IT'S LIKELY SOMEWHERE BELOW THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND OUR PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES THREE BILLION DOLLARS LIKELY STILL IS REASONABLE USING ALL OF THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PROGRAMMATIC COSTS THAT SAID THIS IS ALL HIGHLY ON CERTAIN THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS COULD CHANGE OVER TIME AND WE'LL WE'LL KNOW A LOT MORE IN MAY SIX TWO COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY AT THIS POINT WHAT IS THE FOURTH QUARTER SHORTFALL THAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT -- TWO BILLION TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE DON'T YET HAVE THE FINAL NUMBERS FOR RE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING CLAIMED AT THE END OF THIS MONTH BUT IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IT'S IT'S HOVERING AROUND TWO POINT FOUR TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GREAT THANK YOU A TO JUST TO PROVIDE SOME OVERALL COMMON OVER THE BUDGET LAST DECEMBER OUR OFFICE RELEASED OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET BLUEPRINT WERE VERY EXCITED TO SEE MANY OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WE DISCUSSED ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY EMPHASIS ON LARGE RESERVES -- THE LA -- RELEASED A REPORT IN NOVEMBER TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR POTENTIALLY EVEN TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES DURING A POTENTIAL RECESSION SO WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR CONTINUE TO PROPOSE A SIGNIFICANT RESERVES ALSO -- PAYING DOWN DEBTS LIABILITIES HAVING DONE IT THIS IS REGARDING THE PENSION LIABILITIES WE THOUGHT WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE AND AND MADE A LOT OF SENSE THE HEAVY FOCUS ON ONE TIME INVESTMENT WEATHER WAS HOUSING HOMELESSNESS EARLY EDUCATION AT THE KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS DOES SEEM TO BE AGAIN -- IN LINE WITH OUR OUR THINKING ESPECIALLY WITH POTENTIAL RECESSION LOOMING EXCITED ABOUT MANY OF THE NEW INVESTMENTS THE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY THAT WE HAD MADE IN THE PAST BUILDING ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BY CONTINUING THE INCREASING CAO WORKS GRANTS MANY OF THOSE FAMILIES HAD NOT SEEN A DECADE OBVIOUSLY -- I THE ISSUE THAT WE HAD CHAMPIONED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WERE ULTIMATELY NOT SUCCESSFUL WAS REALLY AROUND INCREASING HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE -- INCREASE IN MEDI CAL ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE GOING FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BEING THAT WAS A VERY PROMINENT IN OUR ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THAT AND LASTLY -- OUR EARLY EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE PRIORITY FOR FOR THIS BODY WE'RE REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR VERY MUCH HERE THAT AND HE ALSO INCORPORATE MUCH OF OUR THINKING IN THE EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSAL ON HAVING SAID THAT I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED THAT WITH THE RECESSION LOOMING HOW THIS REALLY IMPACTS ARE FEELING ABOUT ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING SPENDING -- WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS POINT IS FOR A RESPONSIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY GIVEN MISSED HIS COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE REVENUE ESTIMATES IN THE CONTINUING SHORTFALL IN REVENUE ESTIMATES WERE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY ON IN MOST YOU KNOW JUST OF THE FINAL POINT IS WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IN YEARS PAST -- THE JANUARY PROPOSALS WERE FRANKLY FAIRLY THIN AND -- DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OGDEN ALLOW REALLY AS MUCH FEBRUARY TO MAY PERIOD GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE LARGER POLLS ARE RELEASED NOW IN JANUARY WE'RE EXCITED THAT EACH OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY FEDERAL DONE ON MANY OF THESE VERY LARGE VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY ALSO WITHOUT GOING TO TURN OVER TO MR OBERNOLTE FOR ANY COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'M GONNA START WITH THE LA -- -- YOU'D MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PRE FUNDING TOWARDS THE CAL STIRS UNFUNDED LIABILITY WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PUT TOWARDS CALPERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO IT'S THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY A DIRECT PAYMENT TO PAY DOWN THAT LIABILITY BUT IN CAL STIRS IT'S WORDED IN A WAY THAT ENABLES THE DISTRICTS TO REDUCE THEIR CONTRIBUTION RATES SO I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND -- THAT TWO POINT THREE BILLION WILL THAT RESULT IN A REDUCTION AND CAL STIRS UNFUNDED LIABILITY IF IT JUST IF THE DISTRICTS JUST PAY LESS WITH THAT MONEY OR -- THE RIGHT OR IS IT JUST GOING TO BE A NET ZERO SO THE SO THE THE GOVERNOR HAS TO CAL STIRS PROPOSES THE TO PAY THE AND WITHIN THE DISTRICT SIDE OF THE LIABILITY THERE SORT OF TWO TRACKS ON THE DISTRICTS SIDE OF THE LIABILITY OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES PROVIDE TO PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL STIRS TO PAY DOWN TO BASICALLY PAY SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN THE OVERALL UNFUNDED LIABILITY ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SIDE OF THE LEDGER OKAY I UNDERSTAND SO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BE -- PUT DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OR OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IT'S FISCALLY PRUDENT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THERE ARE THERE ARE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- IN TERMS OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GIVING DISTRICTS RATE RELIEF AT A TIME -- CAL STIRS RATE RELIEF AT A TIME WHEN THEIR OVERALL FUNDING IS RELATIVELY HIGH MEANS THAT THAT THAT FUNDING MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE IN A YEAR -- WHEN THEY'RE WHEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS DECLINING YEAR OVER YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOLDING THAT MONEY IN RESERVE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF RELIEF TO DISTRICTS IN A YEAR OP WHEN REVENUE IS DECLINING THANK YOU I'M FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET NOTICES INTENT TO RAISE TAXES ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT AREAS THERE'S A PROPOSED TAX ON TELEPHONE SERVICE TO FUND THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND THERE IS A PROPOSED TAX ON DRINKING WATER AND FERTILIZER AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERED IN PREVIOUS YEARS TO FUND -- CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T YET HAVE IT AND I THINK WE ARE ALL UNITED IN OUR BELIEF THAT THOSE ARE WORTHWHILE CAUSES BUT -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHY FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT JUST FUNDING THOSE THINGS OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND GIVEN THAT THEY SEEM TO BE ONE TIME CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NOT ONGOING EXPENSES AND SECOND OF ALL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERCEPTION OF US RAISING TAXES ON CALIFORNIANS IN A YEAR WHEN THE STATE HAS A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS JOE COULD YOU ADDRESS WHY WE'RE TAKING THAT APPROACH SURE SO FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BUT THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF THAT WE KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS I THINK THE SECOND THING AS THE LA -- MENTIONED BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS BIG SURPLUS BUT SO LITTLE OF IT IS ONE TIME AND THESE ARE SUCH IMPORTANT PRIORITIES AND MAKING SURE OUR DRINKING WATER IS SAFE FOR MAKING SURE THAT OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES CAN BE FIXED IN A YEAR OR TWO OR EVEN THREE YEARS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT -- SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL ACTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY WE VIEWED AS VERY MUCH EMERGENCY ACTIONS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE RIGHT NOW -- BUT GOING FORWARD WE THOUGHT THAT IF THESE PROGRAMS IN OUR BUDGET WERE A FUNCTION OF THE GENERAL FUND AND IF THE GENERAL FUND WERE TO DROP IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY AND LA -- TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BIKE'S UNDER THE RECESSION SCENARIO THAT OUR DEPARTMENT HAS MODELED REVENUES COULD DROP BY TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN A SINGLE YEAR AND NEARLY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS SENSITIVE CUTS ACROSS A RANGE OF PROGRAMS SEEN AS DISCRETIONARY SUCH AS THESE PROGRAMS OFTEN WILL GET THE AX WHEN AS YOU CAN JUST MATCHING WE ALL AGREE THERE ANYTHING BUT DISCRETIONARY FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE SO THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE INVOLVED BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THIS -- AT BOTH OF THESE -- PROPOSED REVENUE INCREASES AND WE LOOK FOR TO SPEAKING WITH YOU OKAY AYE AYE PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE A NIGHT JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF -- I THINK THAT -- I WOULD PREFER THAT WE SPEND THAT MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND WHEN WE HAVE WITH THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS AND THEN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE ONGOING FUNDING MAYBE IN YEARS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT SURPLUS AND THAT JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU IS THAT IT'S IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS WE GET TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT UNMET NEEDS WE GET TO ADDRESS IN THE STATE AND ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT WAS GLARINGLY ABSENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WAS TO ADDRESS THE -- FOR SHORTFALL IN JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS YOU KNOW SAYS A WERE A HUNDRED NINETY JUDGES SHORT RIGHT NOW LAST YEAR THE BUDGET PROPOSED TO NEW JUDGES AND THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATIONS BUDGET RIGHT NOW HAS NO NEW JUDGES IN THERE AND -- I REPRESENT SAN BENITO COUNTY WHICH IS THE MOST UNDER RESOURCE PART OF THE SUPPORT IN THE ENTIRE STATE I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO TO ME TO SEE THAT I WONDER WHY THAT DECISION WAS MADE SO I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS FOR A NUMBER OF JUDGES BUT THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE INCREASES FOR COURTS IN PUBLIC SAFETY GENERALLY BUT ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE ALL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR THINK IT'S MAKING MISTER MISS MATHIS HAD A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THE WATER RUSHES LE LET HIM THEN YOU MISTER CHAIR WITH WITH THE WATER -- I'M GLAD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO FINALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER -- I DO HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED TAX MEASURES THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT PUBLICLY -- JUST BEING THAT I COME FROM ROLE COMMUNITY -- VIEW SIDE PORTABLE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK -- ON CLEAN DRINKING WATER SAID IN A PROGRAMS EVERYTHING ELSE AND -- THE PROPOSED NUMBERS I'VE SEEN AT LEAST IN THE MEDIA FROM THE GOVERNOR -- ARE SERIOUSLY JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR WHAT'S NEEDED AND KEEPING -- THESE PLANTS RUNNING FOR THESE DISADVANTAGES COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE I MEAN I'VE BEEN TO SITES WHERE WE HAVE BRAND NEW TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE JUST TOO POOR TO BE ABLE TO PAY TO KEEP THEM RUNNING AND WHAT HE'S PROPOSING WITH THANK THE LAST SUMMER SO I WAS TWENTY FIVE MILLION -- TH THAT WOULD COME FROM THIS NEW WATER TAX THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH A AND I'VE GOT AGREE WE NEED SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT -- GENERAL FUND MONEY GOING TOWARDS THIS THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR NEW PROJECTS AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND I WOULD LOVE TO TALK WITH -- WHOEVER FROM YOUR OFFICE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON A PROPOSAL THAT I HAVE THAT I THINK WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SUITED YES SO THAT -- FIRST POINT IS THE GOVERNOR ABSOLUTELY AGREES WITH YOU THAT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH AND HE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED A MORAL COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES INCLUDING IN THE CENTRAL ESPECIALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER SO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL AND ACTUALLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS WHAT WE -- THE COMMITTEE VOTED ON TODAY TO MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE THAT -- THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM BUTTE IS REALLY EMERGENCY SITUATIONS FOR EMERGENCY AVAILABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WATER SYSTEMS CAN STEP UP AND BEGIN TO COMPLY WITH A CLEAN DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOLVING THIS ISSUE IN ANY SORT OF SIGMUND WIDE WILL TAKE MUCH MORE RESOURCES THAN THAT HOW WE GET THE REVENUE TO DO THAT AND WHERE WE SPEND FROM AS WE WERE DISCUSSING THE SOMEONE NUMBER OBERNOLTE THAT WILL BE A LONGER CONVERSATION BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY A COMMITMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHARES WITH YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY -- WITH WITH AC THREE THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD -- WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO PERCENT OF THE GENERAL FUND AS A POSSIBLE ANSWER WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION ANNUALLY TO THAT WOULD COVER NEW PROJECTS PLUS THE MAINTENANCE FOR THEM SO LIKE I SAID I'D LOVE TO DISCUSS FARTHER OR FORTY TYPE DISCUSSING THANK YOU THINK IT WAS FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU FOR THAT -- OVERVIEW OF -- UPCOMING BUDGET ONE OF THE THINGS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE SEEM TO HISTORICALLY UNDER VALUE IS THE NEED TO -- CATCH UP WITH ID DE FUNDING TO DDS -- YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST DECADE THE CENSUS IS GROWN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS UP TO ALMOST A MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA AT HAVE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE HAVE TO A BUILDING IN WHAT I WOULD CALL THE FURLOUGHS WERE ACTUALLY DECREASING SUCCESS RATES FOR THE ID POPULATION OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS YOU HAVE TO LIFE SKILLS CLASSES AT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO IS VIRTUALLY NON WE HAVE NO POSITIVE OUTCOME INVESTMENT FOR THE ID POPULATION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH SOMEBODY WHERE WE CAN MAKE A TEMPLATE AND BUILD A PLAN TO GO FORWARD WITH THE ID IDT POPULATION -- AGAIN OVER THE LAST DECADE JUST TARGETED AUG AUGMENTATION WE'VE HAD AND AND DISMISSED OR DISSOLVE THE -- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA TO SAVE MONEY BUT YET THE INDIVIDUALS ARE UNDER FUNDED AND WE HAVE A NEED FOR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX CASE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA TO REGIONAL CENTERS OUTCOMES FOR EARLY EDUCATION WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE JUST LIKE US AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOW WE CAN HAVE A GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS POPULATION IS RECOGNIZED AND VALUES FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING IN THE BUDGET THAT REALLY TARGETS AT TÔI SO LET ME TAKE MAKE TWO OR THREE QUICK POINTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET AS WELL THE FIRST IS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAD MAYBE LESS DETAIL IN OUR JANUARY PROPOSAL THEN WE HOPE TO HAVE IN A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE THE BUDGET IS ENACTED IS AS YOU KNOW THERE IS A RIGHT STUDY THAT'S COMING OUT THIS SPRING AND SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ONCE THAT COMES OUT WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW WE WANT TO MOVE IN WHAT DIRECTIONS HOW MUCH IT'LL COST AND YOU THE RATE STUDY DEALS WITH RATES BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CHANGE THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THAT SO THE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY WORKING FOR PEOPLE AND ZOOMING OUT FROM THAT EVEN AS WE HOPE TO COMMIT MORE RESOURCES YOU KNOW WHICH WE LIKELY WELL YOU KNOW ONE THAT RATE STUDY COMES AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP PEOPLE IN THESE POPULATIONS WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLARS ACTUALLY BEING WELL SPENT AND I KNOW I'M SURE THAT'S A PARTY THERE IS A SMALL MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING TO THE RIGHT PLACES AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TED FREE SIZE AND OUR K. TWELVE -- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET WE ALSO INCLUDE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND WE HOPE AND EXPECT THAT MUCH OF THAT MONEY WILL GO TOWARD KIDS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES WHO NEED OUR HELP I APPRECIATE THAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY REALLY I'M HOPING FOR IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY DUE MARCH FIRST -- I MEAN WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THROUGH PROVIDERS THAT ARE SENDING OUT REST OF WORKERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE A FULL TIME JOB THERE -- PART TIME AT BEST -- THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY TO LIVE IN PEACE AND GETTING TIPS AND TAKING CARE OF A MEDICALLY FRAGILE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEM INDIVIDUAL WITH AUTISM AND WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF WHAT THIS HAPPENS WITH FAMILIES WHEN YOU HAVE A MORTALITY RATE OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF MARRIAGES WITH CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND THIS DANGER WE NEED TO CARE MORE WE NEED TO BE INVESTING IN THIS PROCESS TO TAKE CARE OF THESE CHILDREN EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE -- I CHAMPION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THE OTHER WITH A TYPICAL CHILD WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS POPULATION BEHIND ABSOLUTELY AND I CAN TELL YOU WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT HE IS A KINDRED SPIRIT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT COMMITMENT SOME TWEAKS SURE THERESA COLOR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST TO ADD AS TO WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET STAR EFFORTS AND RESOURCES PROPOSE FOR -- ENHANCE CASELOAD RATIOS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE A SPECIALIZED NEEDS SO GOING TO YEAR -- CASE WORKER COMMENT EARLIER THERE ARE RESOURCES THERE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AS WELL AS RESOURCES FOR A NEW TO ALSO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE AGAIN ENHANCE NEEDS AS PART OF THIS POPULATION SO THERE'S A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN JANUARY APPRECIATE THEM IN WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN THESE INDIVIDUALS PROPERLY THAT WE'RE NOT JUST SENDING OUT AN INDIVIDUAL TO TO JUST BE A BODY OR A BILLABLE HOURS INDIVIDUALS FOR RESPITE BEHAVIORAL AND ABA ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING FOR THE WE LOOK AT FUNDING PROPER CREATING FOR THIS POPULATION SO THAT THEY ARE THE POPULATIONS CARED FOR THE MATTER WHICH STATUS OR STUFF LIKE THAT THANK YOU MISTER STONE I THINK I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP BRIEFLY ON THE THE ISSUE ABOUT THE WATER AT THE WAY I READ THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS IT'S SOME NEAR TERM MONEY BUT ALSO A WILLINGNESS TO LOOK LONG TERM THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION IS PRETTY CLEAR ON THIS THAT THERE HAS BEEN MONEY AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL COSTS AND FOR SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN WATER QUALITY BUT NOTHING WITH RESPECT TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND THAT SPEND THE WEAKNESS SO FOR US TO EXPECT THE GENERAL FUND AND IT'S VOLATILITY ENDS ALL OF THE VOTER DRIVEN LEGISLATIVE DRIVEN CONSTRAINTS ON THE GENERAL FUND TO BUILD ANYTHING LONG TERM AND EXPECTED GENERAL FUND TO MEET THAT THAT THAT NEED I THINK IS IT APPROPRIATE AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF THE OF THE GENERAL FUND SO I THAT I'M LOOKING FOR THE DETAILS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW WE LOOK PERMANENT FOR PERMANENT FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S SORT OF HOW I READ THAT PROPOSAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO TO SEE HOW THAT DEVELOPS OVER TIME I THINK THAT'S A VERY HEALTHY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE MEET THIS NEED A CRITICAL NEED ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO TURN ON THE TAP AND CAN'T DRINK THE WATER FROM THEIR TASK THAT SHOULD BE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ALL OF US AND BUT WE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW WE'RE FINDING IT AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE LONG TERM FUNDING FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PIECES OF IT BECAUSE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO TO PULL UP MONEY FOR CAPITAL COSTS AT ONE TIME AND USE THAT AS WE DID WHEN THAT'S GREAT NOW BUT IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE LONG TERM AND IF WE T¡I EVERYTHING TO THE GENERAL FUND THEN WE WILL IN FACT SHORT CHANGE THOSE COMMUNITIES OVER TIME WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT AND SO AYE DADDY MUST SAY I DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THIS AND PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AND I KNOW WE WILL BE WORKING ON IT OVER THE YEARS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER FUNG IN THEIR MISTER MISTER MURATSUCHI -- A PUBLIC UP AROUND FROM FROM -- FROM VARIOUS ISSUES BUT IN TERMS OF EARLY EDUCATION FUNDING HOW MUCH OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING WILL GO TO EXPAND CAPACITY -- WITH THERE'S CERTAINLY A NEED TO TO FIND LOT OF COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE CAPACITY TO -- TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE EARLY EDUCATION SO YOU CAN SPEND ON THAT YES -- SO THERE AND TWO STREAMS OF IT THE FIRST IS FOR KINDERGARTEN CAPACITY AND AS YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE UNIVERSAL KINDERGARTEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOT EVERYBODY HAS A FULL DAY OPTION IN FACT ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT IT'S I BELIEVE IT DISTRICTS -- ONLY DON'T OFFER A FULL DAY OPTION TO ALL ELIGIBLE KINDERGARTENERS AND A LOT OF THAT AS YOU MENTIONED IS A CAPACITY ISSUE SO THIS BUDGET PROPOSES IN ONE TIME FINDING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO RETROFIT THESE CLASSROOMS -- BUILD NEW CLASSROOMS AS NEEDED AND MAKING SURE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE CLASSROOMS FOR KINDERGARTNERS WITH BATHROOM SET UP IN THE WAY THE TEACHERS ARE THEY HAVE TO BE RETROFITTED IN A CERTAIN WAY SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO A LONG WAY THE OTHER EXTREME OF ONE TIME FINDING THAT BEARS MENTIONING IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS FOR CHILD CARE WHICH IS ALSO A BIG PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION EXPANDING ACCESS TO CHILDCARE AND THIS IS BOTH FOR CHILD CARE FACILITY CAPACITY AS WELL AS TRAINING OF THE CHILD CARE WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE A WORK FORCE ISSUE THERE -- IT'S IF WE WANT TO IMPROVE CHILD CARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SAID THOSE TWO TOGETHER COME TO ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING IS THERE A FORMULA IN TERMS OF HOW THE RESOURCES WILL BE BY POPULATION DOES IT GO BY WAIT LIST AS A GO BY REGION SO WE HAVEN'T PUT THAT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET BUT I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES SPEAK ABOUT THAT YES THANK YOU JUST COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO GENERALLY SPEAKING -- IN PAST YEARS BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE FUNDED THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY BEFORE -- WE'VE GONE OUT ON A -- RFA REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL ARE FEW PROCESS SO PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED FOR THE FUNDS AND AND IN PRIOR YEARS WE'VE HAD LANGUAGE AROUND PRIORITIZATION FOR AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE RELATIVELY LOW ACCESS CAPACITY AT THIS POINT -- JUST IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE ACCESS IS AN ISSUE IT'S NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU -- IN TERMS OF GOING TO -- TO TRANSPORTATION CAN YOU PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO LINK TRANSPORTATION FUNDS -- TO A REGION'S HOUSING -- NEEDS SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PROPOSAL THERE'S A SHORT TERM POCKET AND A LONGER TERM POCKET FOR THE SHORTER TERM BALK AT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS AND TECHNICAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND THEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS THESE JURISDICTIONS MEET THEIR MILESTONES SO THAT HOUSING PROCESS IS NOT RELATED TO SB WINE OR ANY OTHER I NEED THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT BEING SAID WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONGER TERM ISSUE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED SAT LOOKING AT THIS AND REACHING THESE GOALS OVER THE LONG TERM WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE RENO PROCESS FOR SETTING REGIONAL HOUSING GOALS IN CONCERT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED AND THAT ONCE WE DO THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE A WAY OF HOLDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MEETING THEIR HOUSING GOALS BECAUSE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT ONE WAY OF HOLDING JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE IS WITHHOLDING SOME TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IF THEY DO NOT MEET THOSE GOALS NOW THE WAITED THAT WE ACTUALLY DO THAT -- AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A LONGER TERM PROPOSITION SO IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THIS CURRENT YEAR IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE DETAILS OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK OUT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE WANT THESE GOALS THEY WILL BE HARD FOR SOME COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE HOPELESS THEY'RE DESIGNED AS PART OF THAT REVAMPS PROCESS TO BE ACHIEVABLE AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SIGNALED IS THAT IF DOWN THE ROAD A COMMUNITY IS NOT MEETING ITS HOUSING GOALS AND SOME OF THAT SB ONE MONIES BUT HELD ITS NOT COMPLETELY TAKEN AWAY IT'S A JURISDICTIONS GET BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HOUSING GOALS THAT WE'VE ALL COMMITTED TO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT MONEY SO WE KNOW THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND THIS PROPOSAL IT'S A LONGER TERM PROPOSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON DESIGNING IT SO THAT IT ACTUALLY CHIEF THE GOALS FOR WHICH IT'S INTENDED I DON'T KNOW IF IT DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE AT IS THAT IS CERTAINLY THE THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED THAT HOUSING TRANSMISSION ARE ARE LINKED IT IN MANY INSTANCES AS IF THEY CAN'T BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN YOU'RE FORCING INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FURTHER AWAY AND SO I THINK FROM FROM MANY INSTANCES I DON'T KNOW DO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S FAIR TO LINK TRANSPORTATION TO HOUSING GOALS IF YOU THINK YOU SIX TAKE A STEP BACK THERE'S OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AT RK THE ART IN THE CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WHAT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IS THAT THAT THAT COULD THAT COULD BE CRISES ARE RIGHT NOW HOUSING CRISIS IS LYING TO YOU KNOW LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SO WE DEFINITELY DO AGREE THERE THAT THESE TWO THINGS GO HAND IN HAND BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THEY THEY CONVERGE TOGETHER AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND THAT WHEN YOU BUILD MORE HOUSING YOU SHOULD BE REWARDED WITH TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT STOPS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FROM BUILDING HOUSING IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER YOU DO HAVE A GOOD POINT AND THAT DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ARE DIFFERENT AND COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THANKS COMMITTEES ON THE COAST AND THAT'S WHY THE PRECURSOR TO ALL OF THIS IS REVAMPING THE WAY THAT WE SENT THESE HOUSING GOALS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY WANT THEM TO MAKE SENSE AND WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE THEY DO MAKE SENSE DAN AND WE CAN LINK HOUSING TRANSPORTATION TOGETHER AND AND DO YOU HAVE A FORMULA AND TERMS OF THESE GOALS ARE HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THESE RICH UNCLES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT DON'T ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW IS THE CURRENT REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW NEEDS UPDATING OKAY -- JUMPING TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT -- WE HAVE A PROJECTIONS THAT -- THE FUND IS GOING TO BE EXHAUSTED ONE TO OTHER ANY PLANS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SO IN THIS IN THIS CURRENT IN THIS BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED WE HAVEN'T PROPOSED ANY CHANGES TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT NOW OKAY BUT YOU ARE BUT -- I GUESS THE FROM YOUR STANDPOINT I MEAN THERE IS LIKE -- AWARENESS THAT THE FUND IS PROJECTED TO BE EXHAUSTED BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO CERTAINLY MARK MILLER PARTNER FINANCED YES WE ARE AWARE OF THIS WORKING IN -- -- LOOK AT THE -- THE FUNK ADDITION SITUATION IN THE NBA IS PART OF -- BROUGHT THE PROPER DISCUSSION FOR OTHER ANY IDEAS OUT THERE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE LOOKING AT OPTIONS OKAY THE THE VAST MAJORITY THE REVENUES COME FROM REGISTRATION FEES AND -- AND AND SOME OF THEM FROM DRIVERS LICENSE FEES SO NOT A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THEIR SHARE A GOTCHA -- IN TERMS OF THE LA -- -- IN TERMS OF THE JUST SO THAT EVERYONE OPERATE ON THE SAME INFORMATION WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED UNFUNDED LIABILITIES OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA PENSION -- IN TERMS OF PENSION LIABILITIES OUT I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU TO BREAK IT DOWN ACROSS THE DIFFERENT FUNDS -- WHAT'S THE TOTAL -- THE TOTAL HERE I THINK I HAVE IT HERE SO FOR CALPERS IT'S FIFTY NINE BILLION AND FOR CAL STIRS IT'S A HUNDRED AND FOUR AND BILLION DOLLARS CARE BENEFITS AND I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON THE TO ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL TO IN THAT ASSUMES A SEVEN PERCENT RATE OF RETURN FOR CAL'S SPURS YES CAL STIRS I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK SO IN THE MODELING THAT THAT YOU'VE DONE IF EVER RECESSION DID OCCUR HOW DOES THE STATE RESPOND TO THE FUNDING THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF OUR RECESSION MODELING IS WE LOOK AT -- WHETHER OR NOT BE -- REVENUES AND RESERVES WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR THE ON GOING COSTS TO THE STATES SO -- IN TERMS OF HOW THAT INTERACTS WITH THE PENSION LIABILITIES JUST NOT MUCH JUST USE THE CALPERS EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT CALPERS EXPERIENCES LOSSES BECAUSE WE'RE IN A RECESSION AND THE MARKET GOES DOWN CALPERS WOULD ADJUST THE RATES THAT THE STATE HAS TO PAY TO CALPERS WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR ONGOING COSTS SO -- UNDER OUR MODELING FOR SORT OF A YEAR TO YEAR BUDGET SCENARIO WE DO TRY TO BUILD IN HOW THOSE ONGOING COSTS CHANGE AND WHAT THE COSTS OF THE STATE WOULD BE IN TERMS OF ONGOING PROGRAMMATIC COSTS INCLUSIVE OF -- ODD SALARIES AND AND AND PENSION PAYMENTS AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT WE DON'T MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PAYING DOWN INCREASED UNFUNDED LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF A MARKET DECLINE UPDATE IT TO THE PIPELINE IS IT G. IS YOUR NUMBERS QUICK TO YOUR NUMBERS CORRELATE IN TERMS OF UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT THE STATE HAS YES WE'RE WORKING OFF THE SAME SEVEN NUMBERS AND I BELIEVE THE ON FUNDED RETIREE HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES IS -- THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS ESTIMATED MOST RECENTLY AT NINETY ONE BILLION DOLLARS NINETY ONE I'VE HEARD UP TO TO ONE FIFTY SEVEN BILLION -- FOR THIS IS JUST FOR THE -- PAD MIGHT DEPEND ON WHAT DISCOUNT RATE THAT YOU'RE USING BUT THE TOTALED BUT THE OF ALL THE SIX YES THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE IF YOU ADD UP THE NINETY ONE BILLION THAT JUST A SHADE OVER A HUNDRED BILLION FOR CAL STIRS AND THEN THE FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALPERS STATE PORTION OF THE LIABILITY THAT SHOULD ADD UP TO ABOUT THAT FIGURE OKAY SO THAT SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE COURT THAT'S ME THAT'S THE TOTAL TO THE SEVEN THAT WORK WOULD WERE DRUNK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO GRAPPLE WITH YES I SHOULD MENTION THAT AND I'M NOT SURE IF MISS TO MENTION THIS BUT FOR THE CALLOUSED ARE IS LIABILITY THAT IS SPLIT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE SCHOOLS AND I BELIEVE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT RIGHT NOW IS ACTUALLY BORN BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RATHER THAN THE STATE YES THANK YOU MISTER SWITCH TO THE MISS JOHNSON THANK YOU MISTER SHARE THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WE ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO ADD ON TO AB SEVENTY TWO AND SEVENTY THREE SO WE'RE GOING TO THAT FIRST BROKE TO JONES SAWYER BY JONES SAWYER I'D MAIENSCHEIN MULLIN MULLIN AYE STONE STONE NINE ICE TWENTY SEVEN THAT COULD BE OUT ON TO THE RULES AS WELL BRO TO TOOK HER SIERRA CHRISSY I DON'T SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY LACKEY AYE THE MOMENT MAIENSCHEIN MULLIN WILL AND I THIS AREA NAZARIAN AYE PATTERSON WEBER I TWENTY SIX THEY GIVE THIS MESSAGE THANK YOU MISS SHARE OF FINANCE -- WANT TO -- -- CONVEY MY APPRECIATION -- AS AN EXTENSION OF THE APPRECIATION THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR -- THE GOVERNOR LISTENING TO THE CHALLENGES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE FACING PENSION LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS AND SO I I KNOW THAT TO THERE ARE -- SPECIFIC A ONE TIME PROPOSALS -- TO ADDRESS -- THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING -- HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW -- ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US COMING FROM LOS ANGELES WE ARE JUST COMING OUT OF A PERHAPS HISTORIC A TEACHERS STRIKE THAT -- REALLY GALVANIZED THE COMMUNITY AND IS HIGHLIGHTING THE CHALLENGES UNIFIED DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT DESPITE THE -- THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR BROWN'S -- RESTORING FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION FINDING THAT -- -- THEY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT THAT WHILE WE LIVE IN THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING AND THIS AND ADEQUACY OF STATE FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC EDUCATION CONTINUES TO BE YOU KNOW WERE REFLECTED IN THE -- IT THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT NOT ONLY TEACHERS BUT FAMILIES -- IN LOS ANGELES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE THE OVERCROWDED CLASS SIZES THE THE LACK OF NURSES AND COUNSELORS AND AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND SO MY QUESTION TO -- TO YOU -- AND FOR THE GOVERNOR IS DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE A PLAN TO GET CALIFORNIA FROM BEING FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING BACK TO WHERE WE ONCE WERE IN THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING SO I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS FIRST IS THAT THIS BUDGET DOES PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AS YOU MENTIONED IT PROVIDES THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL STIRS OBLIGATIONS OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL FLOW DIRECTLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING TO OFFER RELIEF TO SCHOOLS AND ALSO AND JESSICA HOMES CAN OFFER MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS BUT IT SHIFTED SOME PRE K. MONEY FOR NON LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES -- OUTSIDE OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEED THEREBY CREATING MORE -- ROOM THAT WE CAN USE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS K. TWELVE SCHOOLS SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS A BIG COMMITMENT IT'S THE HIGHEST EVER LEVEL -- THAT BEING SAD -- THERE WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE WORK TO DO AND THE KEY QUESTION IS REALLY FINDING WAYS HOW TO DO THAT IN THIS BUDGET WE THINK WE'VE PROVIDED WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A STRONG BASE FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION IN THE STATE CONSISTENT WITH OUR OTHER PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO A CHILD CARE AND EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CAL WORKS IN HIGHER EDUCATION WHERE WE ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE A STRONG ON GOING INCREASE AFTER YEARS WHEN THE SYSTEMS RECEIVED -- LAST AND THEY MIGHT HAVE WANTED A ROSTER FOR -- BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WITH K. TWELVE THERE IS A DEMAND FOR MORE AND WE SAW THAT AS YOU MENTION IN LOS ANGELES SO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE WITH ALL OF YOU AS WELL HOW WOULD WE FIND THE REVENUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO DO THAT BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THESE ARE ONGOING COSTS THAT WILL OCCUR EVERY YEAR I MEAN IT'S JUST -- I WOULD JUST ASK YOU THAT -- -- DID THE GOVERNOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THAT -- YOU KNOW WHILE THERE IS MUCH IN THIS BUT THE GOVERNOR'S INITIAL BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WE ALL APPRECIATE FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO YOU KNOW TO THE AT THE THE -- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE ITEMS THAT -- THAT THAT THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE THESE CORE -- -- OBLIGATIONS -- -- I I BELIEVE THAT K. THROUGH TWELVE OF FINDING A CONTINUES TO BE THE STATE'S NUMBER ONE FUNDING PRIORITY -- AND THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE DID HAVE -- AND AND TWENTY THIRTEEN WE WE ESTABLISHED A PLAN TO TO -- RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S -- CATER TO A BUDGET CUTS -- THAT WE SUFFER DURING THE RECESSION BY ESTABLISHING FUNDING TARGETS FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND -- I I WOULD URGE AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR TO LOOK TO WIN A WHAT IS NEXT IN TERMS OF OUR LCF FUNDING TARGETS NOW THAT WE HAVE REACHED THE FUNDING TARGETS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN -- SO IT WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY AS YOU REMEMBER AT THE PEAK OF THE RECESSION PROP NINETY EIGHT LEVEL WAS DOWN TO ABOUT FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND NOW WE'RE ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WE'VE ADDED ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A PER PUPIL BASIS OVER THOSE SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DO YES JUST SORT I AM JUST A DOCTOR AND AND IN MY -- MY QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT A CRUEL JUSTICE A LOT WITH AB ONE OH NINE PROP 47-57 -- BUT I'VE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IMPLEMENTATION AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE USED -- -- OUR INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY -- TO REHABILITATION WHETHER IT'S FORCES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT SABOTAGE UNIT OR WE NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT AND SOMETIMES JUST PLAIN INCOMPETENCE -- IS CREATED ARE WEAPONIZED OUR INABILITY TO -- TO TO ACHIEVE THE KIND OF SUCCESS WOULD BE ABILITY ASIAN THAT WE NEED -- I LIKE IN THAT TO YOU KNOW YOU RUN THE FOOTBALL DOWN TO WIN THE SUPERBOWL YOU FUMBLE ON THE ON THE GOAL LINE OR YOU DECIDE INSTEAD OF USING A CALIFORNIA KID TO RUN BE SMALLER UP TO MIDDLE YOU CYCLE PASSABLE NAPA NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS INTERCEPT THE BALL AS THE ASSEMBLY MEN OF THE LOS ANGELES RAMS WITH A YOU CAN APPRECIATE HOW DISCONCERTING THAT WOULD BE IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON -- BUT SERIOUSLY THE THE THE GOVERNOR HAS TOLD ME HE WANTED TO LOOK AT REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND I'M UNBELIEVABLE PLEASE DAIS TAKEN -- DJJ OUT OF CDC ART AND AS A PUT IN HUMAN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SO THAT WE GET THEM TO TYPE THE HELP THAT WE HAD WITH IT THE NEED THE MOST IMPORTANT I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AND DO YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A PLAN ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THAT -- I HAVEN'T AUDIT RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT ALL OF THE -- REHABILITATION PROGRAMS NCDC ARW THAT OUGHT IS COMPLETED AND IT WILL BE -- PRESENTED THIS WEEK AND WILL HAVE A KIND OF A A LOOK AT THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR OF TO MOVE ON TO PRESENT THE MOST AFFECTED PROGRAMS AND BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU OF THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK TO MY STATE KIND OF JUST CREE BUSY WORK -- WE MOVE THAT FUNDING FROM THEM INTO THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT -- PROGRAMS SO IT'S KIND OF A TWO FOLD QUESTION -- I'M EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH DJJ BUT I'M I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM IF WE HAVE ONE WE HAVE ANY IDEAS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THEN THE SECOND PART -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE REAL BILL TATIAN PROGRAM AND CDC ARE HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE UP PROGRAM -- THAT WE COULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY SO A COUPLE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE FIRST IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS UNDER AB ONE OH NINE AND REDUCE THE STATE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED BY AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WE'RE EXPECTING WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN THAT SEVERAL ADDITION -- SEVERAL THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WILL BE RELEASED UNDER THAT PROGRAM FOR CREDITS AND GOOD BEHAVIOR BUT THAT BEING SAID AS YOU NOTED WE DON'T WANT TO FUMBLE ON THE GOAL LINE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED AND SO WE NOTICED IN THIS BUDGET WHEN YOU TRACK OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS THE LEVEL FUNDING FOR REHABILITATION IS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS WHAT IT WAS IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT YOUR POINT EXACTLY IT'S ONE THING TO SPEND THE MONEY BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING SPENT WHILE AND THE GOVERNOR IS VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT THIS HE HAS THIS PHRASE IS NOT JUST ABOUT RESOURCES IT'S ABOUT RESOURCEFULNESS AND IT APPLIES HERE PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER AREA SO I KNOW THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE WILL WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY TO HIS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS HE'S VERY INVESTED IN LITERACY AND THIS BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR LITERACY COACHES IN OUR PRISONS INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED COACHING OTHER PEOPLE AND HELPING THEM LEARN TO READ BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE THAT HELPING PEOPLE TO READ -- CASCADES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND HELPING THEM GET OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY GET OUT BUT THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WHEN THE AUDIT IS FINISHED -- WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR -- THOSE RESULTS AND SHARE THEM WITH ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONTINUE TO SEE HOW WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TECH THANK YOU THANKS THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR THE MIST BLOW THANK YOU MISS JUST READ US THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU CAMPAIGN IN POETRY BUT YOU GOVERN IN PROSE AND I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO SEE AND READ EVERY WORD OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT HE PROPOSED ON JANUARY I WAS ENCOURAGED THAT HE IS DELIVERING ON HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE AND CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE MODEL THAT DOCTOR WOULD AND I LED LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE TRYING TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET THAT I PARTICULARLY BELIEVE WILL HELP PUT US ON THE RIGHT PATH AND JUST WANTS TO APPLAUD THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND HELPING THOSE OF US WHO COME FROM BLUE COLLAR DISTRICTS HELP TO DELIVER REAL RESULTS WE HAVE A WAY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR NATIONAL RHETORIC AND HELP LEAD TOWARDS A NEW DEAL IN OUR GOVERNOR IS PUTTING US ON A PATH DOING JUST THAT THE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT HE PUT INTO EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HAS PUSHED AS WELL AS HE SAID IS THAT WE HAVE PUSHED TOGETHER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SURGEON GENERAL AND THE EXCELLENT CHOICE OF DOCTOR NADINE BURKE HARRIS WHO WE WERE PLEASED TO BRING TO THE CAPITAL LAST YEAR TO HAVE A WOMAN OF COLOR AND PARTICULARLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA WILL GET US THE RESOURCEFULNESS AND RESILIENCY TO WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING ABOUT INCREASING TO HOME VISITING AND ALLOWING US TO GET INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND TO HELP NEW PARENTS ACHIEVE IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF US WELL I'M PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS ABILITY TO ENCOURAGE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND TO SEE THE INTEGRATION WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERE'S THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET THAT WILL HELP US TO DO JUST THAT DOCTOR WOULD HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO LOOK AT SUBSIDIES THAT WILL ALSO AFFECT NOT JUST THE ACCESS TO CARE BUT THE IN AFFORDABILITY OF CARE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A PLAN IN HEALTH CARE WHICH IS DON'T GET SEC PEOPLE WILL HAVE A CRISIS AND ISSUES IN THEIR LIVES AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEALTH CARE CAN BE AFFORDABLE FOR THE VAST MIDDLE CLASS IN OUR STATE WHO DOES NOT HAVE THAT CURRENT ABILITY AND YES I AM QUITE EXCITED THAT WHEN HE SAID THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA DESERVES HEALTH CARE THAT HE MEANT EVERYONE AND WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN OUR FIRST STEPS THIS YEAR THERE WILL BE MORE ADVOCACY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I HAVE A PARTICULAR SPOT REALLY LOOKING AT THE ELDERS WITHIN MANY OF OUR CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO US AND REALLY WOULD WANT US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCREASE OUR SAFETY NET RESERVE FUND SO WE DON'T ENTER INTO THE PARADOX WHICH OCCURS WHEN WE WILL HAVE OUR NEXT RECESSION WILL PROVIDE US THE BUDGET RESILIENCY TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HUMAN SERVICES BECAUSE THAT'S STILL IN SOME OF THE JURISDICTION THAT WE WORK ON BUT WORKING TO END CHILDHOOD POVERTY AND GETTING US TO FIFTY PERCENT OF CAL WORKS IS A NOBLE GOAL AND WANTS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE LA -- IF I CAN ON SPECIFICALLY HOW DOING IT ACROSS THE BOARD DOESN'T GET CERTAIN FAMILIES TO THAT GOAL MAKING CASH OUT PERMANENT IS A NOBLE GOAL ONE THAT WE HELPED TO CHAMPION LAST YEAR AND ONE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE DISABLED WHO ARE ELDERLY AND HAVE NEEDS BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET I WANTED TO AND IF I COULD ACTUALLY ON A QUESTION WE HAD TALKED ABOUT MCO TAX BUT I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION AND AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE LOGIC IS TO NOT CONTINUE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHAT THE CURRENT THINKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN -- IN THAT FRAME AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK TOWARDS THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE THROUGH THE MCO TAX AND UNDERSTAND THE THINKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION CAROLINE YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT CAL WORKS AND THEN WE CAN SEE I TALK OFF LINE IF WE CAN ON CAL WORKS SUCH A GREAT OF SURE SOUNDS GOOD SO ON THE NCO TAX WHEN WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER AND AS YOU KNOW IN AN ELECTION YEAR THE GOVERNOR BASICALLY AFTER HERE SHE'S ELECTED HAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS TO PUT TOGETHER THIS IN THIS CASE TWO HUNDRED NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE WERE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHETHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD APPROVE THE WAIVER THAT'S NECESSARY FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE NCO TAX -- SINCE THEN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SIGNALS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO APPROVED SUCH A WAIVER THAN WE OTHERWISE MAY I THOUGHT WITH THAT BEING SAID -- WE BUILT OUR BUDGET WE THINK IT'S A GOOD BUDGET THAT AND CO TAX EXTENDING PAST JULY SO WE THOUGHT WE'D FIND EVERYTHING THAT WE NEEDED AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WAIVERS THAT WERE NEGOTIATING OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE WANTED TO PLACE A PRIORITY ON THOSE WAIVERS THAT SAID WE KNOW THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE INTERESTED IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS TAX AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT YEAH YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THEIR SIXTY ONE OF US NOW WITHIN OUR CAUCUS MANY MORE OF US ON THIS BUDGET CHAIR SUCH THAT WE'VE HAD TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE SEATS AND AND ALL WE MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAINTAIN FISCAL DISCIPLINE WE ALSO NEED TO THEY'RE AT SO I REALLY DO HOPE WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION QUESTION AND THAT'S ACTUALLY REGARDING THE -- PROPOSAL REGARDING PRESCRIPTIONS -- I'M INTERESTED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE MEAT ON THAT BONE AND TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS -- WE AS A STATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING POWER OF THE THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND JUST REALLY I'M HOPING YOU CAN ELUCIDATE SOME OF THE -- -- IDEAS OR IDEALS THAT WE CAN BE STRIVING FOR -- WITH THAT PROPOSAL IT'S ALL MAKE TWO POINTS ON THAT PROPOSAL IT'S CLEARLY A PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR AND HIS FIRST OR SECOND DAY IN OFFICE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING THE REST THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE FORWARD TOWARD THAT PROPOSAL AND THE REASON HE DID IT SO EARLY IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT BUT BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE TIME A PROPOSAL OF THIS MAGNITUDE AFFECTING THIS MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SO THE WAY WE'RE ESTIMATING IT RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEIR THEIR TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS THIS PROPOSAL ONE IS TO TRANSFER THAT MEDICAID OR MEDICARE AL -- BENEFIT TO A FEE FOR SERVICE BENEFIT FOR PHARMACY THAT'S MANAGED ACROSS THE POPULATION AND NOT SIMPLY MANAGED CARE PLAN BY MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SAID THAT WOULD PUT THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE SOME ODD IN THAT SAME POOL AND WOULD MAKE OUR NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE MUCH STRONGER WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING THESE DRUGS NOW HOW WE DO THAT AND THE CONTOURS OF A THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION NOT ONLY HAS TO WORK OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE SMARTEST PROPOSAL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO GET A SENSE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF WHAT WE ARE ABLE AND NOT ABLE TO DO AND THAT WILL BE AN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF IT IS THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATE AS AND THIS IS OTHER ORGANISER OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S IT'S EGS OR YOU KNOW CORRECTION IN OTHER OTHER GROUPS THAT -- CAN BAND TOGETHER AND AGAIN GET THE LEVERAGE THAT COMES FROM STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THERE IS MAKING A WEST OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST COST MOST USED DRUGS AND SEEING WHERE WE CAN NEGOTIATE AND REDUCE THOSE COSTS BUT I WILL SAY THAT ACROSS THIS INITIATIVE IN OUR BUDGET WE'RE SITTING HERE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN -- WE DON'T EXPECT SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR NOT THIS YEAR NOT NEXT YEAR AND REALLY NOT IN MANY WAYS THE YEAR AFTER IT REALLY ONLY STARTS TO KICK IN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE LATER IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN ON WORDS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING THE BENEFITS OF THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED WE KNOW WE HAD ISSUES WITH SOME COMMUNITY HOSPITALS RELATED TO THREE FORTY B. SO WE WANT TO START EARLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO GET THIS RIGHT YEAH WE'VE HEARD THAT HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED BUT YES NOBODY HERE HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID IF YOU CAN HELP US JUST TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TOWARDS THIS ADMINISTRATION HE REALLY IS SHOWING LEADERSHIP AND HEALTH CARE AND I'M QUITE PLEASED THAT HE IS BECOMING THE HEALTH CARE GOVERNOR THAT MANY OF US HOPED AND WISHED THAT HE WOULD INSPIRED TO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER AND MISS RIVERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AT -- WELCOME IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE -- I'D LIKE TO BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO -- ANOTHER -- TOPIC THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOWN GREAT LEADERSHIP ON AND THAT IS SO HOUSING THE -- PROPOSAL FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU MENTION WAS BROKEN DOWN TO FIFTY MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WHAT THEN IS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INTENDED TO BE USED FOR SO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT MEET THEIR MILESTONES SO ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF OUR HOUSING POLICIES WE CAN GIVE MONEY TO FOR JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECTLY BELLHOUSING ACTUALLY FUND A HOUSING AND THEIR WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE DOES THAT WE CAN GET MONEY FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AROUND BUILDING THE HOUSING THAT'S THINGS LIKE ZONING PERMITTING STAFFING TO MAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES HAPPENED BUT ANOTHER THING THAT WE RECOGNIZE IS A LOT OF THESE JURISDICTIONS -- THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO LOOK FOR MORE REVENUE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RAISE REVENUE IN CALIFORNIA SO PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING WAS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THESE GOALS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALSO HAVE A POT OF MONEY SO THAT WHEN THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO STEP UP AND THEY TO DO THE RIGHT THING TAKING AT ACCESS TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR MARKET AND MAKING USE THAT FOR ANY GOALS THAT THEY HAVE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE HOUSING SO WE WANT TO WORK JURISDICTIONS THAT DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES AS WELL AND IF YOU STEP UP IN THIS AREA YOU'LL HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO DO MORE IN OTHER AREAS TOO OKAY I THINK I I THINK THAT'S VERY INTERESTING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT IT -- AND I DO THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE INCENTIVIZING OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO MORE THE GOVERNOR -- CLEARLY IS USING A CARROT AND STICK APPROACH -- WE'VE READ A LOT ABOUT THE THE STICK IN THE NEWSPAPER IN RECENT RECENT DAYS -- AND I THINK ALL THIS IS WORTHY OF -- OF -- OF DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD ON -- ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED IS FINDING WAYS TO LOWER THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH AFFORDABLE AND TO A MARKET RATE HOUSING BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THAT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNIT OF FOR EXAMPLE A AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS IN THE RANGE OF A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER UNIT OR SO AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY -- -- IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN -- APPROVED AND IN THE -- A STATE BUDGET THAT'S BEEN APPROVED FOR FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION BUT IT ONLY GOES SO FAR SEE YOU HAVE A BILLION DOLLAR SEA AND -- -- -- FINDING IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT ONLY BUILT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND UNITS AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED FAR MORE THAN THAT AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS SPEND NOT ONLY SPEND THAT MONEY EFFICIENTLY BUT -- -- CHEN UPPER ABILITY THERE TO TO BUILD IT QUICKLY -- OF ONE OF THE -- ELEMENTS OF THE CRISIS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET THE GOVERNOR'S SPOKEN ABOUT THIS IS -- -- THE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE THAT -- OF PEOPLE RENTAL HOUSING OR FEELING GOT WITH RESPECT TO THEIR -- IS TO THE RENTS AND THAT BUT WE NEED TO GET UNITS ONLINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN MODERATE THE BY -- INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING OUT THERE -- AND I DON'T SEE ANY MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT TO KIND OF LIKE THAT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION GOING ON ARMS OF A LASTING ON HOUSING I WANTED TO -- ASK YOU ABOUT -- IS THAT YOU MENTIONED TO REVAMPING THE RENEWAL PROCESS -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DID IN AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE LAST YEAR WHY DO I KNOW THAT THAT WAS MY BILL -- SO I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT ELSE -- THE GOVERNOR IS LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF -- OF IMPROVING -- -- THAT PROCESS AND I'M INTERESTED IN FURTHERING THAT CONVERSATION YOU'RE WELCOME TO PROVIDE SOME -- LIMITED RESPONSE TO THAT NOW BUT THIS IS MORE IN THE NATURE OF ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD THAN THAT -- I'LL HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION ON -- -- -- FIRE -- ABSOLUTELY I'LL MAKE A TWO OR THREE VERY QUICK POINTS -- BEFORE MOVING ON FOR FIRE THE FIRST IS THAT AS YOU NOTED AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S DEFINITELY NO EASY SOLUTION TO THIS HOUSING CRISIS IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIXED WITH IT FIX WITH A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS THE GOOD NEWS FOR THIS YEAR IS WE HAVE LAST YEAR BOTH ARE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR OVERALL HOUSING BOND THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS YET THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR NO PLACE LIKE HOME BOND THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TO HELP THEM WITH HOUSING WE ALSO HAVE THE ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING FROM REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS THAT WAS APPROVED TWO YEARS AGO SO WE'RE HOPING THAT OUR FUNDING LAYERED ON TOP OF THOSE WILL START TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE SECOND THING AND YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT HERE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE REWARD EFFORTS THAT ARE REDUCING THE COST PER UNIT AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE UNITS ARE BUILT QUICKLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ABOUT HOW TO GET THE BEST IDEAS INTO OUR POLICY BUT IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT NOT ALL OF OUR HOUSING POLICIES IN THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE WORKED OUT IN THE MONTHS TO COME AND EVEN THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WERE AWARDING SOMETHING YOU FINDING THAT WERE GIVING OR WE'RE PROPOSING THE EXPANSION OF TAX CREDITS FOR HOUSING -- WHEN THOSE CREDITS ARE AWARDED AND WHO GETS WHAT MONEY IN WINE THOSE CAN ALL BE A FUNCTION OF SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WERE TRYING TO REFINE RIGHT NOW AND EVEN THE DESIGN OF THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT THAT THEY GENERALLY CAN APPLY TO TAX CREDIT AFTER THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED SO WE HAVE SOME INCENTIVES IN THERE ALREADY BUT AS YOU NOTED IT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH SO WE WANT TO DO MORE AND LASTLY ON EVERY NOW AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED ON THAT ISSUE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK ON YOU WITH THANK YOU FOR THIS I I JUST I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION MISTER SHARE ON OF FIRE PREVENTION AND -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE GOVERNOR IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS AND FIRE PREVENTION OF FOREST HEALTH AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THOSE AND WILL BE WORKING ON THOSE AND -- IN BUDGET SUB THREE -- BUT FOUR OUT OF FIVE FIRES SO ORIGINATED ARE URBAN POPULATED AREAS AND THEN MIGRATE THROUGH -- POPULATED AREAS SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY -- UP A FUNDING PLAN TO HELP WITH HARDENING HOMES AND AND ENSURING THAT HOMEOWNERS OR -- -- ABLE TO CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACES -- FOR A FUTURE THAT WE KNOW LIES AND SHALL MAKE ONE POINT AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT AS WELL WHICH IS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING PHARMACEUTICAL EXACT ORDER WAS THE GOVERNOR SIGNED ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION ON THE SECOND DAY HE SIGNED A SERIES OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS FOR WAYS TO FIRES AND ONE OF THEM WAS TO ASK CAL FIRE TO COME BACK WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS A WITH SOME -- PROPOSED MEASURES FOR HOW WE CAN ENGAGE IN THESE HARDENING ACTIVITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT COMMITTEES ARE PROTECTED SO WHERE ABOUT TWENTY TWO DAYS AND SO WE'RE HALFWAY ON THAT CLOCK BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADOPTING THAT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND NOT GIVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY YES SIR THANK YOU MATT ALL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO AS YOU ALLUDED TO THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS -- CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF -- SB CONTINUES THE COMMITMENT TO FOR FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THOSE ARE REALLY GEARED TOWARD KIT COMMUNITY SCALE PROJECTS WHICH WOULD BENEFIT COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS TO RESIDE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WE THINK THAT'S A STRATEGIC -- WAY TO GO ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION AND ALSO JUST MENTION THAT -- CAL FIRES INDICATED THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF FIRES ARGUMENT BECAUSE -- BUT THAT DOESN'T I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THE FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE FIRES ORIGINATING IN URBAN -- DATA COMES FROM STUFF LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ONE KIND OF THAT DATA POINTS OUT IT'S IN MY NOTES STAFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE OF US THE BEST MCCARTY DR I THINK THAT THIS PROPOSED BUDGET MAKES A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY PREPARED TO TAKE ON SOME CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE -- ON THAT POINT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON COMMENTS OF THE LA -- -- SPECIFICALLY -- YOU NOTED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PROPOSAL SPREAD LIMITED RESOURCES TO A BROADER INCOME LEVELS INCLUDING MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS OR THE MISSING MIDDLE AS THE GOVERNOR IS CALLING THEM YOU KNOW I'M A MEMBER THAT REPRESENTS A DISTRICT THAT CONTAINS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE HEAD IN HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THEIR LIVING TRIPLED UP IN GARAGES MOTELS OUR CARS AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN HAVING YOU EXPAND ON THOSE COMMENTS SURE SO SO WE RAISE THIS POINT ONLY TO RAISE A LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE THE TRADE OFF -- ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE LIMITED RESOURCES FOR HOUSING -- SO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I I BELIEVE IT'S FIVE THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM -- THAT THAT'S AN EXPANSION FROM I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM WHEN IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED THAT PROGRAM TARGETS A RELATIVELY HIGHER INCOME GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE UNDER CURRENT RESOURCES THERE IF I'M IF I HAVE MY FAX -- IF I HAVE MY DATA POINTS CORRECT -- THERE'S ONLY SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVE SOME TYPE OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE SO THREE QUARTERS OF OF CALIFORNIANS THERE ISN'T RESOURCES TO TO TO HELP THEM SOMEONE ALLOCATING AMONG LIMITED RESOURCES ALBEIT A SIGNET A LARGE BUDGET SIGNIFICAN BUDGET BUT STILL LIMITED BUDGET WE JUST RAISE THE LEGISLATURE HOW WOULD IT LIKE TO PRIORITIZE WHO TO HELP SURE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GO TO -- RELATIVELY OR WITH THE LEGISLATURE RATHER PRIORITIZE THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS OR SPREAD THE ASSISTANCE ACROSS A BROADER GROUP THAT'S REALLY THE THE THE -- RIGHT BEHIND THE ISSUE THAT WE REYES THANK YOU KNOW THIS IS AN AREA I THINK THAT -- I'M VERY INTERESTED TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AND DECIDING WHERE THOSE RESOURCES WILL BE ALLOCATED AND YOU KNOW MY PRIORITY IS TO FOCUS ON THE HIDDEN HIDDEN HOMELESS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY DOCTOR WHAT THANK YOU FIRST FOR THE LA OKAY COUPLE THINGS ABOUT REVENUES IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS SO AS MR MURATSUCHI NOTED WE'VE HAD A GREAT -- FIVE YEAR RUN WE'VE INCREASED SCHOOL FUNDING BY ROUGHLY FIFTY PERCENT BUT WE'RE STILL THE BOTTOM TEN STATES THE NATION AND NUMBER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TEARING WE DO WE DO HAVE SOME MONEY IN THE HEALTH PROGRAM PRETTY MUCH COLA NOT THE GROWTH LIKE THIS ON PRIOR YEARS YEAH BUT THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE GRANTED LAUSD INSECTS CITY ARE TRYING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS TO THEIR CASH FLOW PROBLEMS AND BUDGETARY ISSUES I WANTED TO TO WRITE SOMETHING THAT IN HERE YOU SAY IS THAT THE POTENTIAL WITH THE ENROLLMENT AND DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT WITH WITH THAT CURRENT CURRENT YEAR REVENUES COMING IN AND PROJECTIONS AND AND THAT POTENTIALLY THE NAY REVISED -- -- ALLOCATION FOR OUR SCHOOLS COULD BE WHERE AT POTENTIALLY LOWER YES SURE THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WILL DECLINE BECAUSE OF -- LOWER REVENUES THE OTHER ISSUE HAPPENING WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME COSTS THAT LIKELY WILL NEED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE GUARANTEE IN MAY THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR SOMETHING LIKE THE LCF OF COLA LIKELY WILL BE SMALLER AND MAY YES IT'S -- AGAIN THE BIG PICTURE WHAT ARE FINANCE RECTOR WAS TALKING TO MR MARTZ WHICH ABOUT EARLIER WALL GREAT NEWS OVERALL LAST FEW YEARS AND POSITIVE NEWS IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IT'S STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- I WANTED TO TO TALK NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE THE HIGHER ED REALLY A PROPOSAL SO THE ELEMENTS OF THEM PARK OUR CARS ARE SOLID CERTAINLY OUR JOB TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE AND THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE ON ON ALWAYS A MINUTE MENTION IS ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE UC AND CSU -- PROPOSALS -- HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE ZILLION COMBINED FOR FOR THE TWO BUT FOR FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT NOT ONE ADDITIONAL SLOT FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS TO GO TO UC I KNOW THE BUDGET HAS MONEY THAT FUNDS PRIOR YEAR -- AGREEMENTS BUT NO ADDITIONAL ACCESS AND THOSE ARE THE ISSUES ARE CONSTITUENTS ASK US ABOUT THAT CSU YOU KNOW WE HAVE I THINK ELEVEN THOUSAND SLOTS BUT THERE'S THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED CSU APPLICANTS THAT HE DID THAT DON'T GET ACCESS EVERY YEAR SO THOSE ARE SOME ISSUES WILL BE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL VERY -- PLEASED TO SEE THAT FOR FREE FOR A YEAR TO IN THERE FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE KIND OF TWEAK THAT WE WANTED TO TO PUT ON THE TABLE IS THERE ARE -- FULL TIME STUDENTS WHICH BE NOT THE FIRST TIME BUT BUT ALL IMPROVEMENTS IS OUR FIRST TIME FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD GO MANY COMMITTEE CALL STUDENTS NOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GRACE EXPERIENCE WHEN THERE ARE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN THEY GO WORK FOR A FEW YEARS MAYBE THEY'LL HAVE LESS THAN SIX OR TEN UNITS UNDER THEIR BELT AND THEY GO BACK IN A ROLE FULL TIME TECHNICALLY THEY'RE NOT FULL TIME FIRST TIME SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO TO CONSIDER WE GO THROUGH THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS AND LASTLY FOR THE FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION -- PROPOSAL OF YOU KNOW AS AS OUR CHAIRMAN SAYS IT IT'S IS GREAT WE SEE THESE ISSUES IN JANUARY USUALLY HAVE TO FIGHT TO PUT THEM ON THE MAP AND SO WHILE WORK SQUABBLING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ELEMENTS THE MONEY ONE TIME ON GOING YOU KNOW THERE IS A GREAT APPRECIATION THAT THE RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO BE INVESTING IN THE LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF THE DAY WERE TRYING TO TACKLE WITH ADDRESSING ARE CHEAP AND GAP ON OUR SCHOOLS -- INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY SPECIALLY CHILD POVERTY OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM REALLY EDUCATION IS A PLACE THAT NO RESEARCHERS ECONOMIST NOBLE LAUREATE SAID THAT'S A PLACE YOU OUGHT TO BE INVESTING SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED BY THAT ELEMENTS THERE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW KIND OF FINE TUNING THAT THE LONG TERM CREE QUE FOR ALL PLAN HERE AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE ACCESS JUST FOR FOR PRE K. BUT -- ZERO THREE FIVE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS TREMENDOUS THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I I ONE ECHO A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT DOCTOR ARAMBULA MADE HE AND I WORKED VERY HARD -- ALONG WITH MANY OF OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES ON HEALTHCARE ISSUES AND AND AND THE GOAL OF PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA SO I APPLIED -- THE GOVERNOR'S MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS ARE MERE ACTUALLY WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND -- BUT HOWEVER THEIR HEARTS SOME VERY BOLD PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON -- IT TO THAT EXTENT AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR GOING FORWARD -- DO HAVE ONE QUESTION ALL OVER THE YEARS A LOT OF PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CUT -- AND SOME OF THE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED -- I THINK A PARTICULAR AROUND -- -- WITH THE SPACE YOU WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS OR PROP SIX PROP FIFTY SIX HELPS TO INCREASE THEM BY SOME REIMBURSEMENT BACK TO PROVIDERS BUT THERE THERE'S THINGS LIKE NON MEDICAL THAT WAS CUT TEN PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND LEVINSON NEVER BEEN RESTORED -- AND OTHER PROVIDERS AS WELL SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO IS YOU KNOW IS THAT SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO LOOKING AT IN THE FUTURE HERE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT -- BUT -- AND THAT'S SO LET HIM ANSWER THE QUESTION I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP SALTERTON OVER THAT IT WAS ANDERSON BERMAN FINANCE SO YES I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE TIME SO I THINK THAT THE MOST COMMON YOU KNOW -- ISSUE THAT WE HEAR ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDER RATE REDUCTIONS WERE THE REDUCTIONS UNDER AB NINETY SEVEN -- THE RECESSIONARY REDUCTIONS AND SO THE WAY THAT THOSE REDUCTIONS WORK IS THAT THEY WERE REDUCTIONS OF UP TO TEN PERCENT MEETING THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION CAN EVALUATE IF THERE WERE ACCESS CONCERNS WE CAN REDUCE THE SIZE OF THOSE REDUCTIONS OR -- CHOOSES STOP IMPLEMENTING THEM IF THERE WAS DEMONSTRATED ACCESS CONCERNS IN FOR OVER TWO THIRDS OF THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE EITHER BEEN ELIMINATED BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHEN -- THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS THAT THERE WAS AN ACCESS PROBLEM AND THIS BUDGET -- DOES A LOT TO INCREASE PROVIDER -- FIFTY SIX AND SO -- CERTAIN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WE'VE COME OUT OF THE RECESSION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA TO TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ARE STILL A FEW THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN RESTORED SO I'M MORE INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW IS THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS IN THE IN THE PAST THAT THAT HASN'T PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAVE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP US IN THAT REGARD ALWAYS ALWAYS AS WE HAD WHEN WE RUN DOWN SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN THE PAST TWO LEGISLATIVE ACTION US THERE'S ACCESS CONCERNS WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THOSE AS WELL -- JUST -- YOU KNOW ON -- LAST WEEK -- THE CUT BECAUSE OUR FAMILY FOUNDATION RELEASED A POLL THAT LOOKED AT ISSUES THAT THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S WANT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNMENT SALUTE TO WORK ON AND AND AND IN ORDER OF OF THAT WERE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING AND SO SO I GUESS THAT I WANTED KUDOS TO THE ORDER -- THE MINISTRATION FOR THEIR PROPOSALS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION I WOULD ADD THAT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF AS WE HAVE IT IT ACTUALLY A VERY APPROPRIATE EMPHASIS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND AND AND GETTING PEOPLE OFF TO GOOD START MANY PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT OUR SENIORS -- -- HAVE HAVE NOT SEEN THE EMPHASIS THERE THAT THAT THAT WE ARE THAT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT THEY THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THERE ARE MANY SENIORS WHO ARE ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS FEDERAL POLICIES AND AND EVEN STATE POLICIES THAT THAT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PREVIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS AND SO AS WE LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS AND WE LOOK AT HOUSING WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT ARE VULNERABLE SENIOR POPULATION AS WELL BECAUSE IT THEY THEY ARE NOT AS THEY ARE NOT AS VOCAL THEY ARE NOT AS MOBILE OFTENTIMES AND BUT AND AND WE SHOULD NOT HIDE WE SHOULD NOT IGNORE THAT AND I HOPE THAT WHO GOING FOR WE CAN HAVE THE ANY KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF THAT AS WELL AND THEN FINALLY -- AS WE LOOK AT -- -- IN THAT IN THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION COLE WAS VERY INTERESTING -- VERY INTERESTING CYSTATIN STICKS IN THE MATTER HOW YOU READ THIS BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT -- AND I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY EXACT CATEGORIES BUT YOU PUT THE TOP TWO CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT TOPIC TOGETHER YET EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY INTERESTED IN MENTAL HEALTH AND AVAILABILITY OF ACCESS TO PROVIDERS AND AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SO AS WE LOOK AT HOUSING AND THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS -- IS REALLY CRITICAL THE WE LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH MY MY OPINION MENTAL HEALTH PM THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE CHALLENGES CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE HOUSING THAT WE HOPE HOPE TO CREATE AND SO -- THAT MENTAL HEALTH PICK PEACE HAS BEEN HAS SOME SOMEWHAT VACCINE RECOGNIZED BY A HUGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS AND I HOPE THAT I HOPE WE CAN WORK OUR WORK ON THOSE ISSUES GOING FORWARD SO AND ONE LAST POINT ON THAT MENTAL HEALTH IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR HAS COMMITTED TO APPOINTING A VERY HIGH LEVEL ADVISER TO HIM AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ON MENTAL HEALTH SOMEONE WHO IS KNOWN NATIONALLY AND SO I THINK WE'LL ALL BE WARNING WHO THAT PERSON IS VERY SOON BUT I THINK IT'S SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ADVANCE THE AGENDA AND PRIORITIES THAT YOU DESCRIBED BECAUSE ONE POINT THAT YOU MAKE WHICH IS SO TRUE IS FOR A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES HIGH HOUSING HOMELESSNESS WE ALL DRAW A PICTURE IN OUR HEADS UP WHAT THAT PERSON WAS AFFECTED MAY LOOK LIKE BUT IN FACT ALWAYS AFFECTS A MUCH WIDER SLICE OF THE POPULATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER -- RUBIO THE MYSTERON LOS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- DISCUSSION REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION OF INMATES -- YOU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT INCREASING FUNDING FOR TIME TO SUPPORT THE TEACHERS OF THOSE INMATES BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT A PART OF THE ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE AND I THINK THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUE IS THE LACK OF STAFFING WITHIN THOSE THOSE EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS -- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES THERE'S -- ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO FIFTEEN INMATES PER ONE TEACHER WHICH IS REALLY PUTTING THOSE TEACHERS AND DANGER BUT IT'S NOT JUST WITHIN THE THE THE TEACHING IT'S ALSO IN THE WITHIN THE STAFFING OF THE PRISONS AND SOUL -- I'VE HEARD SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOME OF THE INMATES DON'T GO TO THOSE CLASSES BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE GENERAL POPULATION THEY GET THREATENED BY OTHER INMATES AND SO SO I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT FOR THOSE TEACHERS BUT I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFFING TO SUPPORT THOSE TEACHERS WALL THERE IN THOSE IN THAT SETTING WITH THOSE INMATES IS THERE ANY -- -- ANY -- LE I'VE ARE WE LOOKING INTO THE STAFFING RACIAL SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORTERS TEACHERS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IF THE TEACHERS ARE IN DANGER -- OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO AN EFFECTIVE JOB BUT IF THEY'RE BEING ATTACKED FOR EXAMPLE OR IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFFING WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM TO WHERE THE INMATES ARE NOT GETTING TO THOSE CLASSES THIS MONEY IS GREAT BUT IF WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY -- INCREASING THE LITERACY OF THESE INMATES HOW ARE WE GOING TO REHABILITATE ABSOLUTELY I'LL MAKE ONE POINT AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL -- FOR THE INITIATIVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTEE TO IN THIS BUDGET THE ADDITIONAL MONEY A STEP FOR STAFF AND FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO TO RECRUIT PEOPLE -- HE WE MIGHT NOT THINK OF AS TRADITIONAL STAFF SO OFTEN EVEN OTHER INMATES WHO CAN SERVICE LITERACY COACHES THERE'S ANOTHER INITIATIVE THAT I DIDN'T MENTION IN THE SHORT PRESENTATION BUT IT'S THROUGH CAL VOLUNTEERS TO RECRUIT FORMERLY INCARCERATED KEEP ALL WHO HAVE TURNED THEIR LIVES AROUND AND SERVE AS MENTORS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL INCARCERATED SO THAT SOME OF THE WAYS WE CAN LEVERAGE NEW MODELS BECAUSE WE NOW WITH STAFFING THERE'S ALWAYS SO MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO BUT ON THAT SHORTAGE THAT YOU DESCRIBE ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE THANK YOU MADELINE CLEAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT -- STANDARDIZED STOPPING LEVEL LOOKS AT EACH INSTITUTION EACH SECURITY LEVEL AND FOR EACH TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF STAFF ARE ASSIGNED TO CATCH AREAS OR -- EDUCATION OR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OR ANY TYPE OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS OR JUST IN THE GENERAL SECURITY SETTING -- SO AT THIS AT THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROPOSALS -- AT THIS TIME TO INCREASE OR CHANGE THE STAFFING LEVELS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGH STEP THROUGH THE BLUEPRINT THROUGH STANDARD AYE STAFFING LET ME JUST OUTSIDE THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE STAFFING LEVELS WITHIN THE PRISONS -- I WOULD HAVE TO DO SOME FURTHER RESEARCH ON THAT BUT AT THIS TIME WE HAVE -- EACH CLASSROOM HAS A SPECIFIC CAPACITY FOR EACH TEACHER AND WE DON'T EXCEED THAT WE MONITOR -- MONTHLY TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF A TEACHER IS UNAVAILABLE THAT THE -- THERE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS DOESN'T EXCEED THAT THE CORRECT SECURITY LEVELS OKAY WELL THEN LET ME ASK THE OTHER -- THE REVERSE QUESTION DO YOU MONITOR HOW MANY OF THOSE INMATES ARE ACTUALLY ATTENDING BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE SO WE MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF OF STUDENTS BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ATTENDING AT ALL THEN WE'RE INVESTING MONEY INTO EMPTY -- CLASSROOMS ARE NOT THAT -- CAPACITY CLASSROOM SO IS THERE ANY STUDY TO SEE HOW MANY INMATES ARE ACTUALLY ATTENDING BECAUSE OF THE GOAL IS TO EDUCATE THESE INMATES AND REHABILITATE THEM SO WHEN THEY COME OUT -- INTO THE REGULAR POPULATION THAT THEY'RE THEY AT LEAST HAVE THE READING SKILLS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER SO IS THERE -- ANY WAY OF TRACKING OR MONITORING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE INMATES ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE SO SUPPOSEDLY PAYING FOR YES SO THE US DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS RIGHT RULED REHABILITATION HAS A DASHBOARD PROGRAM THAT LOOKS EVERY MONTH AT EVERY INSTITUTION EVERY TYPE OF -- REHABILITATION OR EDUCATION PROGRAM OFFERED IT LOOKS AT THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN EACH CLASS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS ASSIGNED TO THAT CLASS AND THAT ALSO GOES BACK AND IT LOOKS AT -- IN ARREARS EACH MONTH HOW MANY -- STUDENTS OR SANDERS ATTENDED THOSE CLASSES TO LOOK AT PARTICIPATION RATES AND SO THEY ACTUALLY WILL LOOK AT THE DATA MONTHLY AND IF THEY FIND AN ANOMALY IN A CERTAIN AREA THAT SAY THEY HAVE -- TO TEACHERS AND COULD HANDLE EIGHTY STUDENTS IN THAT CLASSROOM BUT ONLY TWENTY STUDENTS ATTENDED IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR SOME OTHER REASON THAN LACK OF PARTICIPATION LIKE A LOCK DOWN OR SOME OTHER EVENT AT THE INSTITUTION THAT WOULD PREVENT THE OFFENDERS FROM ATTENDING THE CLASS MIGHT MONTHLY TRACK OKAY -- IS THERE A WAY TO TO ACT -- IS THAT INFORMATION THAT -- ACCESS ONLINE OR IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ACCESS ONLINE BUT I WILL WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S LIKE A ROLLED UP SUMMARY BECAUSE IT'S LIKE SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF SPREADSHEET THAT WE CAN ROLL IT UP BY INSTITUTION TO TRY AND PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL WHAT THEN THEN THAT'S MY WELL THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT THEN THE THE THE ACCESS TO THAT DATA IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE AND SO HOW IS IT THAT I DO HAVE MONTHLY GOALS TO HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE THE -- FORMAT LOOKS LIKE BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK TO THROUGH TWELVE HUNDRED PAGES THEN HOW IS IT THAT THERE THAT -- THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ACCESSING THAT DATA IF I CAN'T ACCESS IT IMMEDIATELY SO THAT THEY DO A ROLLED UP SUMMARIES WHAT I'M I'D WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO READ THAT HAS ALL THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE MORE DETAILED VERSIONS BUT I WILL DEFINITELY TO SPEAK WITH THEM AND TALK ABOUT OF MORE ACCESSIBLE DATA FOR OKAY SO I'M WHAT I'LL DO IS -- I WILL DO MY PART AND I'LL HAVE MY STAFF REQUEST THAT THOSE FORMALLY SO IF YOU CAN -- POINT THAT'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AGAIN I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE THESE CLASSES AVAILABLE AND WE'RE NOT SERVING THE POPULATION NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THAT WE WERE PUTTING ON THAT THOSE TEACHERS IN DANGER AND SOME OF THE STAFF MEMBERS AND THEY'RE IN DANGER IF THERE'S NO ADEQUATE -- -- SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER RAMOS THE MISTER COOPER AND THEN THIS WEEKS -- FOR A HOMELESS ON ATTENTION TO IT IN A DECEMBER DINO COUNTY THERE'S -- OVER THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS YOUTH -- THAT ATTEND -- K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS THERE ALSO EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLDS THAT ARE CONSIDERED HOMELESS YOUTH THAT ARE THERE TOO SO WITH THIS POPULATION IS SEEN THE THE FOCUS NOW ON THE HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL THE SUB POPULATIONS AS FAR AS TARGETING THE HOMELESS YOUTH AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND SAN BENITO COUNTY THE SAME THROUGHOUT SOME OTHER COUNTIES IN THE AREA SO WE START TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT CHILD POVERTY AND WE START TO LOOK AT THE EXPANDING OF SHELTERS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS THERE A WAY AND IS THERE ANY MORE FOR THEIR DIALOGUE THAT WE COULD HAVE TO START TO FOCUS ON THE HOMELESS USE SITUATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S SHELTERS AND EXPANDING SHELTERS SPECIFICALLY TO THAT SUB POPULATION THAT'S THERE I BELIEVE THAT TAPPING THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IS IS GREAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO HAVE SOME RESOLVES THE MEASUREMENTS TO IT THAT CAN WE START TO FOCUS ON THE SUBPOPULATIONS BUT SPECIFICALLY HOMELESS YOUTH IN A IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA START TO BRING SOME SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES THERE I THINK THAT'S A WAY OF BEING PROACTIVE TO THAT SITUATION AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND I WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVE ANY FURTHER DIALOG WITH YOURSELF IN THE LA OWES OFFICE TO START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ABSOLUTELY I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS FIRST IS THAT THAT FUNDING THAT WE PUT OUT FOR HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW IS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR MARKET AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS RESERVED FOR THE BIG CITIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE OTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING ARE MUCH MORE GENERAL RIGHT NOW AND SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT OUR METRICS RIGHT AND THAT WERE NOT FORGETTING ANYBODY AND MAKING SURE WE SERVE THE FULL RIGHT AGE RANGE OF PEOPLE THE SECOND THING IS IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR BUDGET -- PRETTY GROWING HIGHER EDUCATION WE DO HAVE SOME FUNDING IN THERE AS WELL TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR OTHER EMERGENCY HOUSING SITUATIONS OF COURSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING LIKELY MAY NOT EVEN BE IN ROLE THAT YOU SEE OR CSU OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU WITH THANK IS AN AREA THAT I THINK -- STARTS IN COMPASS THE THE TRUTH -- SENSE AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND ALL THE SUB POPULATIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER COOPER DISCOURSE ABOUT CANNABIS ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE THE BUDGET PROPOSES TWO POINT NINE MILLION DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT LOOK LIKE ON THAT PIECE SO I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO WILL HOPEFULLY BE COMING OUT BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT REVENUE IT'S ALWAYS THE FEAR HERE THAT NO ONE WILL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT A LOT OF THE PROJECTIONS THAT WERE MAKING AROUND REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE WE KNOW A LOT OF THE REVENUES OF NOT MATCHED WHAT ALL THIS EXPECTED AND IT'S STILL RELATIVELY UNCERTAIN RIGHT COMES TO THAT SPECIFIC ALLOCATION LET ME TURN IT OVER KRYSTLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- IT'S GONNA BE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO GO OUT SEND TEAMS OUT MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CAMPUS RETAILERS ARE ACTUALLY ABIDING BY THE REQUIREMENT TO PAY THE APPROPRIATE TAXES ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IS THE ISSUE OF THAT IS THE REVENUES OF FALL SHORT BECAUSE THE BLACK MARKET STILL THERE HAPPENED CANNABIS GROW IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE SO FOR MOST FOLKS THAT OUR LICENSEES PLAYING NO DOING THEIR PART AND THE ISSUE OF THE FOLKS THAT AREN'T DOING THAT SO I GUESS I'M CONFUSED WITH THAT WITH THOSE PROBLEMS REVENUE SO WHAT ARE WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE BLACK MARKET ISSUES WHERE WAS THE PROBLEMS LIE KERN COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS AS WAS POINTED OUT THAT THE NAY REVISION SHOULD INCLUDE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN ON HOW WE WILL -- ALLOCATE -- ALLOCATION THREE PROCEEDS FOR -- THE CANNABIS TAX FUND SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS WELL AND HIT INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AROUND THE LEGAL CULTIVATION AND POTENTIALLY SOME MONEY TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- THE BUDGET ACT DOES INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT WAS AGREED UPON LAST YEAR WHICH INCLUDES SOUTH OF LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT -- -- IN COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THE REGULATORY AGENCIES SO CALIFORNIA BERMAN FOOD AGRICULTURE BEER CANS CONTROL PUBLIC HEALTH FISH AND WILDLIFE IN SOME OF THOSE OTHER AGENCIES VOTERS WERE A POP SIXTY FOUR IN WITH ITS HERE IT'S IT'S PERMANENT IF YOU CAN WORK BUT UNTIL WE TAKE EFFECTIVE STEPS TO DEAL WITH THE BLACK MARKET ISSUES NOT GOING AWAY AND IF I'M REAL AND I'LL CONTINUE TO THE BLACK MARKET BECAUSE I'M NOT PAY TAXES ON THE PLANE EMPLOYMENT SHARES ANY OF THOSE THINGS SO THE BLACK MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE SO TO TAKE A LOOK FORTY HEARING I THOUGHT THAT YOU GUYS HAVE ON THAT -- AND THE EARLIER THIS WOMAN FROM LA TALKED ABOUT -- DJJ GOING AWAY THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING AWAY GOING TO WELL ASIA IS IT HSS YES -- WILL PROJECTED SAVINGS WITH THE MOVE SO THAT THIS IS A NEW PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO DEVELOP THE PROPOSAL -- WHAT ONE -- DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL FACTS ABOUT SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON RIGHT OKAY APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN TIE HIM TO THE WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN THE PRISONS THAT WE NEED -- IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF WHAT PROGRAMS WORK NOW THAT IS COLLECTED THAT GOES BACK TO MISS RUBIO QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE READING IN THERE IT'S AMAZING THESE PROGRAMS A BIT AFFECT FOR SOME NUMBER OF YEARS NOW YET THERE ARE NO MEASURES TO TELL US WHAT IS REALLY EFFECTIVE FROM THE MOTLEY EARLIER SHOULD LOOK AGAIN BUT I LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG THESE PROGRAMS BEEN AFFECT IN HEALTH AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY METRICS ON WHAT'S AFFECTING WAS NOT EFFECTIVE MATALIN THE CLEAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO THAT MOST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION -- THERE'S BEHAVIORAL THERAPY THAT HAS LIKE A ANGER MANAGEMENT IN CRIMINAL THINKING -- THAT THEIR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS MANY PROGRAMS AND THEY ALL -- FOR THE MOST PART USE EVIDENCE BASED -- PRACTICES IN THE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND -- IMPLEMENTATION THAT WILL ASSIST WITH PROVIDING AS OUTCOMES THE DEPARTMENT ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF THEY DO AN OUTCOMES EVALUATION REPORT EVERY YEAR -- THAT ASSIST WITH -- DETERMINE THE RECIDIVISM RATE -- AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME PROGRAMS THAT THEY OFFER THAT ARE NOT EVIDENCE BASE THERE -- THAT MORE THEY THEY ALLOW FOR -- INNOVATION WE CALM INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING GRANTS THEY DO LIKE ARTS PAINTING DANCING MUSIC THERAPY THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE ARE IN THE INSTITUTION SO THE DEPARTMENT -- DOES TRACK AND LOOK AT -- LOOKS AT PARTICIPATION RATES IN IN ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND BASED ON THE -- -- PARTICIPATION RATES THAT THEY'VE SEEN LATELY THAT IT'S DEFINITELY INCREASE WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN AM BUT ALL OF THAT WAS FIRST DISSIPATION RISK OF JUST SHOWING UP JUST SITTING THERE IN THE CLASS NOT DOING ANYTHING YOU THE PARTICIPATION RATES SO THIS PROGRAMS BUT AS FAR AS RE PROGRAM WHICH WAS RUBIO REFERENCED EARLIER THAT PROGRAMS BENEFIT FOR HOW LONG THE PROGRAM MANY YEARS RIGHT AT THE ADULT EDUCATION BASED CHRISTIAN YES SO IT'S IS MIND BLOWING WE HAVE NO NUMBERS ON THAT ACTUALLY TO TELL US IN IN TERMS OF GRADUATION SCHOOL DIPLOMAS -- CALIFORNIA IS IN WHEN THE TOP FIVE STATES IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF GETTING -- GT'S AND HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY FOR INMATES BUT WOULD LIKE TO CONVINCE IN THE PROGRAMS AND ANY TEST A RECESSES OF RECIDIVISM FOR A MINUTE AND WHEN THE BIG ISSUES OF RECIDIVISM WE KNOW IT'S FIFTY PERCENT RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S PER C. C. R. BUT WHAT'S WHAT'S MORE TROUBLING IS MOST THE FOLKS THAT INTO COMING BACK INTO THE PROGRAMS DON'T COME BACK TO SEE YOU SEE OUR LEGAL COUNTY JAILS SWEEPING FOLKS WHO'D BEEN SENT TO COUNTY JAILS UP TO FOURTEEN YEARS AND A LOT OF COUNTY JAILS ARE BUILT TO REALLY HAVE ROBUST PROGRAMS AND DON'T HAVE THE FOOTPRINT TO DO THAT SO WHEN YOU COMBINE CCAR'S FIFTY PERCENT RECIDIVISM RATE AND THE COUNTY JAILS RECIDIVISM RATE I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY IT'S PROBABLY AT LEAST SEVENTY PERCENT IF NOT HIGHER BUT THERE THERE'S NO CONNECTION I HOPE THE GOVERNOR LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S UPON WHEN YOU ARE GETTING A SMALL SNAPSHOT OF IT LIKE I SAID MOST FOLKS ARE NOT GOING NEXT A PRISONER IN COUNTY JAIL BECAUSE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA WE DON'T WANT THESE FOLKS COME BACK WE WILL HAVE THE BEST AND MOST ROBUST PROGRAMS POSSIBLE BUT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY EFFECTIVE THAT'S GONNA STOP THESE FOLKS IN REALLY GIVEN THE THE THE PRIME OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN LIFE AND AND AND NO ONE ON I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW NOBODY CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM CORRECTIONS NOW WILL HAVE MEETINGS WITH C. C. R. FIND OUT OR IS FOR SURE STILL DIDN'T KNOW THAT NO ONE CAPTION INFORMATION SO HOPEFULLY WITH THIS NEW GOVERNOR -- IT'S A FRESH LOOK CLEAN NICE TO COME IN AND REALLY SEE WHAT THE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT DOING THAT A LOT OF MONEY IS BEING SPENT LOVE PEOPLE GETTING PAID BUT IS REALLY HELPING THE FOLKS AT NEW THE MOST ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER DO SO TO WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT ARE -- OFFICE DID LOOK INTO ISSUES RELATED TO IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMMING AND RAISED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT A LACK ABOUT CONTRACTING I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FORWARD A COPY OF OUR REPORT I WOULD ACTUALLY SIT DOWN WITH YOU ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR GOOD IN THIS WHICH WILL JUST ADD ON VERY QUICKLY ON THE WALL AND THEN GO TO SOME OF THE WORKS CHU CHU I AM SORRY TO PRESENT WHEN AB SEVENTY TWO TWO FIVE CHIU AYE AYES TWENTY SEVEN TWO ZERO AB SEVENTY THREE TWO TWO AYE AYES TWENTY EIGHT AND THE RULES ON MANY ROLES CHU CHU I HI TWENTY SEVEN GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ONE OF THINGS I AM PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- AND I KNOW HE OUTLINES THE IDEA OF DOING A TASK FORCE ON THIS AND OBVIOUSLY PAID LEAVE IS -- BENEFICIAL MANY WAYS LOWERS INFANT MORTALITY RATES INCREASES LIKELIHOOD AND DURATION OF BREAST FEEDING REDUCES POST PARTUM DEPRESSION AND OBVIOUSLY FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR THE FAMILY -- CAN YOU SAID SOME LIGHT ON BEING OUTLINED IN TEN TO LONG TERM FUNDING AND AND ALSO THE TASK FORCE WILL LOOK AT DISPARITIES BETWEEN PAID LEAVE POLICIES LOW WAGE WORKERS OR DISPROPORTION WOMEN OF COLOR LEAVE POLICIES VERSUS HIGHER EARNERS -- AND WILL THE TASK FORCE LOOK AT THINGS WITH IT THROUGH AN EQUITY LINES ABSOLUTELY SO LET ME MAKE THREE POINTS ABOUT THAT FIRST DAYS AT THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STILL FIGURING OUT HOW EXACTLY WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO INCLUDE IN OUR BUDGET BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE THIS COMMITMENT VERY CLEAR AND IT COMES FROM THE GOVERNOR AND IT COMES FROM THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND A WEARING WAS DEVOTED HER LIFE TO EXPANDING FATE PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES AND KIDS -- THE SECOND POINT ON THIS TASK FORCE COUPLE MONTHS AND WE'RE HOPING BY APRIL NAY BY THE SPRING AS THE NAY REVISED TIMES THAT WILL HAVE MORE DETAIL ON THE BEST WAYS IN WHICH THAT COULD WORK THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW IT'S LED BY THE ADMINISTRATION BUT IT'S NOT IT MINISTRATION ON WE TASK FORCE AND SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT TASK FORCE WILL OPERATE WITH WHAT YOU'RE IN PART IN TERMS OF WHICH POLICIES ARE PASSED THE ADMINISTRATION AND ITS BUDGET HAS COMMITTED TO SIX MONTHS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE THE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO PARENTS OR OTHER FAMILY CAREGIVERS IF IT'S NOT A TWO PARENT FAMILY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DESIGN THAT IN A WAY THAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD THAT THE FAMILIES FUNDING LAST AS WELL AS ENABLING PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND NOT PUTTING AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS AND THE LAST THING I'LL MENTION WHICH IS MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT WHICH YOU RAISED ABOUT EQUITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS DISPARITIES I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS TASK FORCE WILL DO IS START TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE RESULTS SOMEONE COMING FROM THE MOST RECENT PAY FAMILY WE BILL THAT WAS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE TWO YEARS AGO OR WANTED TO AFFECT TWO YEARS AGO WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WHAT THAT BILL DID WAS IT INCREASE THE -- INCREASED PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACCESS ACROSS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS INCREASED REPLACEMENT RATE SO SEEING HOW THAT IS GOING WHETHER TAKE UP IS INCREASING AND HOW WE HAVE TO FUND THIS PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE EXPANDED TO SIX MONTHS WE CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE THAT REPLACEMENT RATE FOR THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS IS A BIG PRIORITY AND MORE BROADLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS IT DOESN'T DO MUCH UNLESS PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT SO AS PART OF OUR PROGRAM WE WANT TO ADDRESS ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION PROVISIONS MAKE SURE THAT IN THE WAY THAT WE DESIGN A PROGRAM OFTEN THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE MOST HELP AND MOST NEED THE RELIEF TO BOND WITH THE CHILD ARE THE ONES WHO FACE THE MOST TERRIERS TO ACTUALLY TAKING LEAVE EVEN WHEN THERE'S A HIGHER PLACE AND RIGHT SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU IN DECIDING THAT SO THAT THOSE FOLKS GET ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM GREAT WILL SIGN ME UP ONE WORK ON IT THANKS THANK YOU SEEING ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR ACTUALLY ANY COMMITTEE NUMBERS LET ME JUST LET ME JUST THINK THIS CHIU AND ESTHER FEES FOR ANYTHING STATE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMING MONTHS AND MADE OVER THIS -- GREAT BUDGET SUB THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT WE ARE A CHURCH
