BE TRICKLING IN. THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AND NOW SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS WITH OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT THERE'S MORE OF YOU OUT THERE THAN THERE ARE OF US UP HERE. PICKING YOU CAN BE SURE THOUGH THAT IS GOING TO BE. AB A LOT OF PEOPLE PEOPLE WATCHING IF NOT HERE THEN FROM HOME AND FROM OTHER OFFICES. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE WATER FIX. GOOD HERE SEEMS TO BLOOM APPROACHING. AND WHICH THERE'S PROJECT HAS RAISED AT THE LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND AND SO I HOPE WE ARE WHICH MAKES FOR A GOOD DISCUSSION TODAY. SERVICE PEOPLE KNOW I REPRESENT THE DELTA AREA AND AND ON THE WATER FIX AND AND THE BUT. BEFORE THAT. TWIN TUNNELS AND EVERYTHING THAT'S COME BEFORE OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT. AND AN FOR THE REST THE STATE WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR THE STATE WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR RATEPAYERS. AND TODAY'S HEARING AS WE ALL KNOW IS ESPECIALLY TIGHT TIMELY AS WE KNOW. METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT BUT LAST MONTH AUTHORIZED. TEN BILLION FOR THIS PROJECT AND YESTERDAY SANTA CLARA A THREAT IN THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THE FUNDING HAS BEEN STALLED OFF AND ON SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER OVER THIS PROJECT IF IT'S COMING TOGETHER NOW THAT I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN FRONT OF US ABOUT THE POSSIBLE. IMPACTS AND NEXT STEPS. M. WE DIDN'T AUDIT LAST YEAR. AND FOUND SOME YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S OR PRIEST ARE LIKE THE FINANCIAL ANNOUNCES HAD NOT BEEN DONE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS HAD NOT BEEN DONE TO THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE. WE'RE STILL NOT SURE OF EXACT COSTS. WE'RE NOT SURE OF EXACT FUNDING. NOW WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT WILDLIFE FISH. AND AS WE ALL KNOW SEX AND EXPERTS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS. IF WE LOOK AT MEGA PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD WE KNOW THAT. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. ON PALM ALMOST ALMOST WITHOUT DOUBT THEY GO OVER BUDGET BY HALF SOMETIMES BY THREE TIMES WHAT THEY WASN'T INITIALLY ESTIMATED SO THEN SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WILL AND WHO WILL PAY FOR ALL OF THAT. WHO WILL MANAGE ALL OF THAT WILL RATE PAYERS BE ON THE HOOK A AND IS BEEN ESTABLISHED MULTIPLE TIMES? THAT THIS PROJECT WILL NOT CREATE ONE EXTRA DROP OF WATER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I CAN SEE BEFORE US TODAY AS WE GO FORWARD. AND SO WE HAVING A JOINT HERE TODAY BETWEEN AND THAT. OVER OVERSIGHT. WITH THEM THE BUDGET DEALS WITH THIS AREA AS WELL AS THE WATER. AND COMMITTEE AND SALAS TOGETHER I HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE A VERY FRUITFUL DISCUSSION. ARM AND FLIPPED CALLED AND FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO. MISTER BLOOM IF YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME. OPENING COMMENTS TAKING CARE EGGMAN. AND THANK YOU. SO WE TRY TO GET. ONE MORE TIME. HOW'S THIS ONE OVER HERE. RIGHT. WAIT. IT IS IT'S WORKING NOW OUT RIGHT WE GOT IT. A WELL. THANK YOU CARE EGGMAN. BECAUSE SAID THAT THREE TIMES ALREADY. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE AND TO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I WANTED TO. FOR STATE MY APPRECIATION FOR THIS HEARING COMING TOGETHER AT ALL I THINK IS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT TO A WE REALLY NEED TO BE TAKING INTO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD NOTE THAT. THE BUDGET FOR THIS PROJECT ACTUALLY PASSES OUTSIDE OF OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE SO WE DON'T HAVE THE BUDGETARY OVERSIGHT OVER. A A PROJECT LIKE ALL THIS IS TO ME IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE SCALE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL OVER WHICH BY SUBCOMMITTEE DOES HAVE OVERSIGHT. SO WE WANT ONE ISSUE I THINK WE NEED TO. A GRAPPLE WITH IS WHERE IS THE OVERSIGHT CAN TAKE PLACE ON ON A. ON THIS PROJECT HAS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN ITS SIZE. THE INTO. I CAN SAY THAT AS THE CHAIR OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE I SEE FIRSTHAND THE COST OF OPERATING AND MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT WATER DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND WATER RELIABILITY IS THAT CLIMATE CONTINUES TO TREND TOWARD THE EXTREMES AND TO ALL THE SCIENCE POINTS IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS BOUNCES FURTHER STRAINED. AND WITH COSTS INCREASING AT THE SAME TIME I LOOK FOR TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY AND GETTING AN UPDATE ON THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. THANK YOU AND I THINK WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO OUR FIRST PANEL NUMBER ONE. WHICH IS CARL AT NEIMAN DIRECTOR OF IDW ARE. GARY LIP NERD DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DELTA CONVEYANCE. I LEAN SO BACK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND DIANNE RIDDLE ASSISTANT DID DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIVISION DUMP WATER RIGHTS. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME. GOOD MORNING THIS IS THE SUM OF. OKAY. EXCUSE ME WELL THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX AND. ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEES. AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS ACTIVITIES OCCURRING IN PARALLEL ON THE ENGINEERING THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE GOVERNMENTAL AND FINANCIAL FRIENDS OF THE PROJECT. OF THIS MORNING I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME UPDATES. RELATING TO ALL THOSE TOPICS AND I'LL HOPEFULLY ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I WOULD EMPHASIZE ALSO. I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS PROJECT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER MY DOOR OPEN. TO YOUR STAFFS OR ANY QUESTIONS MOVING FORWARD. I LET ME FIRST TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT REGARDING. WHAT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS CURRENT SITUATION? WITH REGARD TO THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM WATER SUPPLIES IN THE WATER FIX PROJECT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT THAT MOVES WATER THROUGH THE DELTA WAS COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SIXTY. BEFORE COMPUTERISED MODELING A FLOWS. A BEFORE THE STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS SUCH AS SEQUEL AND NEPA AND THE STATE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THAT GUIDE CURRENT OPERATIONS. AND WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SIX DECADES OF PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE RISK OF EARTHQUAKES CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE. TO FIFTY EIGHT YEARS LATER I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT THAT THIS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FACES DIFFICULT CHALLENGES UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE. WATER FIX IS ESSENTIALLY AN UPGRADE TO THIS NINETEEN SIXTIES ERA INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT WILL IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF WATER SUPPLIES FOR TWENTY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND THREE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. AND ALSO RESTORE MORE NATURAL FLOW PATTERN A IN THE SOUTH DELTA. WATER FIXES IN IT IS IN ADDITION TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND WILL BE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WATER. WATER RESOURCES IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT HAS BEEN ARE OPERATED AND MANAGED A BY THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. WATER FIX WOULD ADD THREE NEW INTAKES FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT WITH STATE OF THE ART FISH SCREENS TO THE NORTH DELTA AWAY FROM SENSITIVE FISH HABITAT. THIS WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO OPERATE THE STATE WATER PROJECT USING EITHER THE NORTH OR SOUTH FACILITIES TO LESSEN IMPACTS ON FISH. WILL PROVIDE OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION THE ABILITY TO OPERATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WITH THAT SAME FLEXIBILITY. THE PROJECT WOULD MOVE A MAXIMUM OF NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND. THROUGH TWO TUNNELS AND IT WILL BE OPERATED TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTS. AS WELL AS PERMITTED FLOW CRITERIA TO MEET BOTH FISHERY IN WATER QUALITY NEEDS. ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED DESCRIBES SOME RECENT DESIGN BY MINTS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS OF STUDY. RESULTING IN A SMALLER PROJECT FOR PRINT AND FEWER IMPACTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ON THIS TYPE OF OPTIMIZATION HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR EFFORTS AS WE WORK TO REACH FINAL DESIGN. I DO WANNA ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THIS PROJECT DOES HAVE TREMENDOUS PHYSICAL IMPACT ON DELTA COMMUNITIES THERE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY. NO WAY AROUND THAT AND. IT IS OUR DESIRE AND I'LL DESCRIBE. IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AT IN A MOMENT A IS OUR DESIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WORKS INTENSIVELY WITH OTHER CONSTRUCTION A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. TO AYE ABLY. MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER FIX HAS BEEN VERY COMPLEX IT'S TAKEN YEARS OF PLANNING STUDY AND COLLABORATION TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. OTHER WATER FIX IS A PROJECT THAT WILL ADDRESS ECOSYSTEM CONCERNS WHILE SECURING THIS CRITICAL WATER SUPPLY FOR CALIFORNIA IN FULFILLMENT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIRECTIVE OF THE DELTA REFORM ACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE DELTA. ULTIMATELY THE REASON FOR WATER FIX ITSELF IS NOT PARTICULARLY COMPLEX OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE TELLS US THAT WE CAN EXPECT FLASHER STORM EVENTS. AND LONGER PERIODS OF DROUGHT IN THE FUTURE. SUCH CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION WILL IMPACT BOTH OF THOSE DELTA REFORM ACT GOALS. WHAT WATER FIX WILL DO IS INCREASE CLIMATE RESILIENCY BY ALLOWING THE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF WATER THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND INTO STORAGE WHEN THAT WATER IS AVAILABLE AND GREATLY REDUCE IMPACTS ON SPECIES? IT WILL DO THIS A IN THE PART OF THE DELTA THAT IS MUCH LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE. AND GREATER WATER QUALITY FLUCTUATIONS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WITH THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BY EFFICIENTLY AND SAFELY MOVING WATER THROUGH THE DELTA WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE. WE BELIEVE WATER FIX STRENGTHENS THE STATE'S EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF WATER SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES WATER FIX IS JUST ONE OF MANY PRIORITIES INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S WATER ACTION PLAN. AND THIS PLAN INTEGRATES THE MANY WATER SUPPLY TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL INCLUDING RENEWED EMPHASIS ON WATER CONSERVATION. WATER FIX IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP REGIONAL WATER MANAGERS PURSUE THOSE PORTFOLIO OPTIONS AND MAXIMIZE LOCAL INNOVATION AND RESILIENCY. REGARDING LOCAL GROUND WATER BASINS AS WELL AS NEW STORAGE WILL REQUIRE RELIABLE SURFACE WATER SUPPLY. RECYCLING PROGRAMS BENEFIT FROM THE CLEANER ORIGINAL SUPPLY THAT DELTA WATER WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WITH WATER FIX. INSTABILITY OF THE STATE'S LARGEST SOURCE OF RELIABLE WATER WOULD MAKE INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THESE OTHER WATER SUPPLY AREAS. MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. AND WHILE WATER CONSERVATION RECYCLING DESALINATION AND GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ARE VITAL COMPONENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO. FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL WATER MANAGERS THEY SIMPLY DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH WATER TO REPLACE SUPPLIES CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF AN UPGRADE. MANY REGIONS IN THE STATE HEAVILY RELY ON DELTA CONVEYED WATER PRINCIPALLY PARTS OF THE BAY AREA CENTRAL VALLEY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THERE WATER PLANNERS PREDICT DECLINING RELIABILITY OF THESE SUPPLIES EVEN WITH INVESTMENTS IN CONSERVATION RECYCLING GROUNDWATER DESALINATION STRATEGIES. THEY ARE ALSO PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN PURSUING AND PROTECTING THE MOST AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS. AFTER ELEVEN YEARS OF ANALYSIS DIALOGUE IN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY WATER FIX REMAINS THE BEST APPROACH TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT PROTECT SPECIES HABITAT IN WATER QUALITY. WHILE SECURING A CONTINUED RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE WATER SUPPLY. THE COST OF THE PROJECT IS. FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S INTO A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DOLLARS. AND THAT'S FOR CONSTRUCTION MITIGATION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES A CONCERT OR A CONSERVATIVE THIRD. CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY. MEANING WE HAVE ADDED THIRTY SIX PERCENT TO THE COST DOES A SAFE BUT FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE MOST CURRENT EVALUATION OF RISKS INVOLVED WITH TUNNELING AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS TYPE. THE ESTIMATE ITSELF IS ALSO CONSERVATIVE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES FROM THREE DIFFERENT INDUSTRY EXPERTS THAT ARE USING THREE DIFFERENT INDUSTRY STANDARD AND RISK ADJUSTED METHODS. WE ARE USING THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE. WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING OUR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THIS UPDATE WILL PROVIDE A BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS FOR THE NO PHONE NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND PROJECT. AS AN UPDATE OUR EARLIER WORK WHICH WAS AN AGGREGATE OF BENEFITS AND COSTS THIS PROJECT WILL LOOK SEPARATELY AT DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN THE STATE WATER PROJECT AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. WE EXPECT TO FINALIZE THIS UPDATED REPORT BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. THE DEPARTMENT IS OF VERY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES COLLABORATING ON COST ALLOCATION FINANCING FOR WATER FIX. THEY ARE ACTIVELY DRIVING THIS IMPORTANT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FORWARD AND WE SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS. SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF WATER FIX WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE STATE WATER PROJECT BENEFICIARIES OF THIS PROJECT. ALTHOUGH THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT HAS VOTED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE REMAINING THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THE PROGRAM WE DO EXPECT THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT CONTRACTORS WILL PARTICIPATE. ZONE SEVEN WATER AGENCY IN EASTERN ALAMEDA COUNTY VOTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. METROPOLITAN VOTED APRIL TENTH TO INVEST TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROJECT AND AS YOU NOTED JUST YESTERDAY SANTA CLARA. OF VOTED TO INVEST SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROJECT A KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY IS SCHEDULED TO VOTE ON MAY TWENTY FOURTH. THERE ARE OTHER STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WHICH I'M SURE MISS PEER WELL DESCRIBE FOR YOU WHO ARE ALSO OF WEIGHING THE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT AND AND MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR INVESTMENT. A NEW JOINT. POWERS AUTHORITY A TO DRESS FINANCE IS EXPECTED TO BE FORMED BY SOME OF THE PARTICIPATING WATER AGENCIES. TO COVER THE INITIAL STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL D. W. ARE ISSUES BONDS. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY ARE CURRENTLY TO ISSUE THOSE BONDS WE ARE SEEKING VALIDATION IN THE COURTS. IN THE FINANCE JPA WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COVER THE FINANCING FOR THE PROJECT IN THESE INITIAL STAGES UNTIL HAVE VALIDATION OCCURS. I WATER FIX. WE BELIEVE IS AN EFFECTIVE IMPRUDENT AND OVERDUE INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE. THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA RELEASED A STATEWIDE OPINION SURVEY IN MARCH FUNDING THAT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS SAY THE PROJECT IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S FUTURE QUALITY OF LIFE AND ECONOMIC VITALITY. IN ADDITION SCIENTISTS FROM THE CENTER OF WATERSHED SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. FOUND THAT THE ORIGINAL CALIFORNIA WATER FIX OPTIONS SEEMS TO DEAL BEST WITH THE FUTURE CHANGES TO THE DELTA AND SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO KEEP DELTA SMELT. SALMON AND OTHER DESIRABLE FISHES AS PART OF THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM ESPECIALLY IF IN ASSOCIATION WITH EXPANSION OF ECO RESTORE. WHY THE PROGRAM PROGRAM ITSELF IS COMPLEX A PROMINENT PUBLIC AN EMINENT FISHERY EXPERTS SEE IT AS A NECESSARY UNVIABLE PATH FORWARD? AT THIS TIME WE HAVE SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND PERMITS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED. WE HAVE OUR SEQUENT NOTICE OF DETERMINATION ARE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PERMIT FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AS WELL AS BIOLOGICAL PIT OPINIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL AT AGENCIES WE HAVE SEVERAL THAT LIE AHEAD OF COURSE ONE IS THE CHANGE PETITION AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AS WELL AS A CONSISTENCY CERTIFICATION FROM THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING A SUPPLEMENTAL. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DESIGN AND DECREASED IMPACTS TO WETLANDS SALMON AND SMELL. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST I SUSPECT. I MAY BE THE STEPS THAT WE ARE TAKING ON GOVERNANCE AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. I WITH THE FINAL PERMITTING ON THE HORIZON A IMPLEMENTATION IS IMMINENT. AND TO EMBARK N THIS IMPORTANT NEXT STEP D. W. R. IS ADJUSTING ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ENSURE AN EFFICIENT. AND EFFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THAT PROTECTS THE STATE INTEREST BY MANAGING RISKS AND CONTROLLING COSTS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DELTA CONVEYANCE OFFICE AND APPOINTED A DEPUTY DIRECTOR GARY LAETTNER OF WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY. AND THROUGH THIS CONVEYANCE OFFICE AND UNDER GARY'S MANAGEMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL RETAIN ITS AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT OF WATER FIX REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND QUALITY CONTROL. THIS OFFICE WILL OVERSEE THE WORK OF THE SOON TO BE FORMED A DELTA CONVEYANCE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. OF ALSO FOR SHORT CALLED THE D. C. A.. A WHICH WILL BE A PUBLIC AGENCY CHARGED BY GW ARE WITH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF WATER FIX FACILITIES. THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT ROLE. WILL BE DESCRIBED IN A JOINT EXERCISE OF POWER AGREEMENT A WITH THE CONSTRUCTION JPA. OUR ROLE BE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DELIVERED ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. INSURE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION JPA TAKES EFFECTIVE STEPS TO SAFELY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT THE PROJECT WITH INDY W. OUR SPECIFICATIONS WHILE PRUDENTLY MANAGING THAT RISK. THE DEPARTMENT WILL APPROVE SPECIFICATIONS APPROVED MATERIAL CHANGES ANNUAL BUDGETS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OF THE J. EPA AGREEMENT. ONCE THE FACILITY IS BUILT. THE CONSTRUCTION JPA WILL DISSOLVE THE FACILITY WILL BE TURNED OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT AS THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF THAT FACILITY. UP THERE ARE THREE POTENTIALLY FOUR MAIN INGREDIENT AGREEMENTS AND TOTAL THAT WILL ALLOW THIS OVERALL GOVERNMENT STE AND FINANCING A MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE TO WORK. THERE ARE LIKELY TO NEW GPA IS AS I MENTIONED ONE FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION ONE FOUR OF THE FINANCING OF THE PROJECT. AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR A FINANCE GPA A SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE THIRTY THREE PERCENT. OF THE PROJECT THAT. METROPOLITAN HAS AGREED TO A TO FINANCE. THEY'RE ALSO AS I MENTIONED BE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE CONSTRUCTION JP. FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION WATER FIX THIS AGREEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY THE LEGAL MECHANISM THAT DELEGATES THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROGRAM TO THE GPA. A FINAL COPY OF THAT AGREEMENT WILL BE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE ONCE IT'S FINAL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD A FEDERAL PARK. TOWARDS FINAL PERMITS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS. TO DELIVER THE PROJECT. WITH THAT OF I THINK ALL PAUSE AND. MOVED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE PANEL OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS AS YOU SEE FIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE HAVE A POLL THE PRESENTATIONS VERSANT QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE ON. THAT'S THIS JOINT HEARING TODAY MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. THE RESEARCH IS CONTROL BOARD. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY I AM HERE TODAY WITH ANTI AND LITTLE OF OUR DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU AND. AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE WATER PORTS ROLE IN AND WATER FIX I'M ATTRACTED NAY MATHIS TOUCHED UPON IT AND I'M JUST GOING TO ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT BUT THE SUBSTANCE THE PROCESS. THE DEGREE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT'S AVAILABLE AND. THE THE TIME TABLE SO JUST TO. TO TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THEM THE MISSION OF THE WATER PORTS AND WHY WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. I'D THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S AND REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD MISSION IS TO PRESERVE ENHANCE AND RESTORE THE QUALITY OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER RESOURCES INCLUDING DRINKING WATER. FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALL BENEFICIAL USES. AND TO ENSURE PROPER WATER. RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND EFFICIENT USE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT REGARD TO ITS WATER RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THE STATE WATER BOARD IS CHARGED WITH ADMINISTERING THE STATE'S WATER RIGHT SYSTEM TO ENSURE. THAT ANYONE WHO TAKES WATER FROM A LAKE RIVER STREAM OR CREEK. FIRST HAS A LEGAL RIGHT TO TAKE THE WATER. AND USE IT IN A WAY THAT IS NOT WASTE FULLER AND REASONABLE AND SECOND THAT THEY DO SO IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT MORE SENIOR WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS. OR UNREASONABLY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WITH RESPECT TO OF WATER FIX ON THE STATE BOARD HAS TWO MAJOR CHARGES US TOUCHED UPON BY CONTRACTOR NEMETH. FIRST TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. HAVE PETITIONED THE BOARD TO ADD THREE NEW POINTS ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WHERE THEY ARE I'M. ARE AUTHORIZED TO DIVERT AND TAKE WATER UNDER THEIR WATER RIGHTS FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. FOR THE PROPOSAL. TO GO FORWARD IT WOULD. REQUIRE THE APPROVAL BY THE BOARD OF WATER RIGHT CHANGE ON A PETITION. FOR THE STATE BOARD TO APPROVE THE STE THE CHANGES A TIME THAT DOES THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR BY THE BUREAU AND D. WR. THE BOARD MUST FIND TIME. THREE THINGS THAT THE CHANGES DON'T CONSTITUTE A NEW WATER RIGHT OR ENERGY OR INJURE ANY OTHER WATER RIGHT TIME LEGAL YOU ANY. OTHER LEGAL USER OF WATER. SECOND THAT THE CHANGES WILL NOT RESULT IN UNREASONABLE IMPACTS TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND THIRD THAT THE CHANGES ARE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. SO DEPENDING ON ITS FINDINGS THE BOARD CAN EITHER AUTHORIZED THE CHANGES AS PROPOSED. AUTHORIZED THE CHANGES WITH ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE CHANGES MEET THE CRITERIA THAT I JUST STATED OR DENY THE PROPOSED CHANGES. THE BOARD ON IF THE BOARD APPROVES THE CHANGES ON IN THE POINTS OF DIVERSION AS REQUESTED TIME THE STATE WATER BOARD IS ALSO REQUIRED. BY THE DELTA REFORM ACT TO PUT THE TO A INCLUDE APPROPRIATE DELTA FLOW CRITERIA. AND I AM AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL SO THESE APPROPRIATE DATA FLOW CRITERIA WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FISH AND WILDLIFE NEEDS AND OTHER COMPETING BENEFICIAL USES OF WATER. THE FOCUS CRITERIA WOULD BE INTRON UNTIL THE STATE WATER BOARD COMPLETES ITS CURRENT PROCESS TO UPDATE AND IMPLEMENT THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY. CONTROL PLANTS FLOW REQUIREMENTS. THE SECOND MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT I'M IS THAT THE PROJECT WILL REQUIRE A PERMIT FROM THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. AND AS PART OF THE CORE PERMIT THE STATE WATER BOARD MUST ISSUE A CERTIFICATION UNDER FOUR SECTION FOR A ONE OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT. WHICH. WHICH WILL ARTICULATE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY. THE CORE IS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE THE STATE WATER BOARD SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS INTO ANY PERMIT THAT IT AUTHORIZES. I'M. FINALLY I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT TIME THE STATE WATER BOARD IS A RESPONSIBLE AND PARTY UNDER THE FOR FOR THE WATER FIX UNDER THE UNDERSEA QUOTA. AND THAT'S SUCH THE STATE WATER BOARD MUST CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT DISCLOSED IN THE INNER. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT PREPARED BY DIP DE WR. BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS TO ISSUE TIME NECESSARY APPROVALS FOR THE PROJECT. SO NOW GOING INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE PROCESS AND THE TIMING. AND THE BOARD THE STATE WATER BOARD IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATIVE HEARING ON THE WATER FIX WATER RIGHT CHANGED MISSION. DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S I SAID TO APPROVE THE PROJECT AND IF SO UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. OTHER RECORD FOR THE HEARING WILL ALSO INFORM THE WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION. I'M THE BOARD HEARING ON WATER FIX IS GOVERNED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT WHICH INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO ENSURE FELT A FAIR PROCEEDING AND DUE PROCESS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PRINT TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE CROSS EXAMINE OTHER WITNESSES. AND PRESENT REBUTTAL AT EVIDENCE. PURSUANT TO THE APA THE STATE WATER BOARD MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO A PROHIBITION ON X. PARTY. OFF THE RECORD A COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING SUBSTANTIVE OR CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IN THE PROCEEDING. AND THEY CAN ONLY CONSIDER INFORMATION THAT IS PART OF THE OFFICIAL HEARING RECORD IN MAKING THEIR DECISION ON THE CHANGE PETITION. THE STATE WATER BOARD BEGAN ITS PROCESS IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN DE WR AND RECLAMATION SUBMITTED THE TIME WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION. I'M ANDY W. ARE SUBMITTED ITS APPLICATION FOR A WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION FOR THE WATER FIX PROJECT. THE BOARD HAS DIVIDED ITS HEARING PROCESS INTO TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART WAS FOCUSED ON IMPACTS TO OTHER LEGAL USERS OF WATER AND THE SECOND PART FOCUSED ON FISH AND WILDLIFE INCLUDE AND. INCLUDED APPROPRIATE BUT. AT DELTA FLOW CRITERIA. THE FIRST PART OF THE I'M HEARING IS COMPLETE. THE SECOND PART OF THE HEARING IS IN PROGRESS. AYE WE ARE UP JUST ABOUT TO MOVE INTO THE REBUTTAL. PORTION OF THAT PROCESS. THE SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETING THE HEARING I WILL DEPEND ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE EVOLVED DURING FACE UP PART TWO AND WHILE I'M. AND INCLUDING I'M SOME ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION THAT TWR AND RECLAMATION. ARE COMPLETING FOR THE PROJECT AND OTHER ISSUES WE ARE MOVING AS EXPEDITIOUSLY ON AS WE CAN. AFTER THE HEARING IS COMPLETE. OF THE BOARD WILL ISSUE A WRITTEN DRAFT DECISION ON THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION. I'M THE DRAFT ORDER WILL EXPLAIN THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL BASIS FOR THE DECISION AND WILL BE BASED AS I SAID EXCLUSIVELY ON THE EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD. ON. THAT'S BEEN VETTED THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS. THE DRAFT ORDER WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC FOR COMMENT AND REVIEW PRIOR TO CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD AT A PUBLIC HEARING FOR ADOPTION. UP FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THAT HEARING AYE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WILL MAKING A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION FOR THE WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION. I'M IN THE WATER AT A QUALITY CERTIFICATION DECISION WILL ALSO BE BASED ON THE HEARING THE RECORD OF THE HEARING PLUS. OTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. BOTH THE DECISION ON THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION DECISION MADE BY THE BOARD AND THE WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION DECISION MADE BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. ARE SUBJECT TO RECONSIDERATION BY THIS THE STATE. WATER BOARD. THERE HAVE BEEN AND ARE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PART A PATIENT DURING THE BOARDS WATER FIX DECISION MAKING PROCESS. BOB THE STATE WATER BOARD AND GOT. D. W. ARE PROVIDED BROAD PUBLIC NOTICE OF PROPOSED WATER RATE CHANGES IN WATER QUALITY. CERTIFICATION AND THE ASSOCIATED HEARING PROCESS TO OTHER WATER USERS IN THE WATERSHED AND. AND ALL M. OTHER OF SUCH A INTERESTED. I'M AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS AND INTERESTED PARTIES. ON AND ON. AND NOTIFY THEM AND LET THEM KNOW HOW AND WHEN AND IN WHAT WAY THEY COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. ON IN OUR FORMAL HEARING PROCESS WE HAVE OVER SEVENTY FIVE PARTIES REPRESENTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOVERNMENT. AGENCIES AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. I'M IN AND AS I SAID IN THE EVIDENTIARY A FORMAL PART. PROCESS. UPDATE THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRESENTING THEIR THEIR AFFIRMATIVE CASES CROSS EXAMINING WITNESSES PER. PRESENTING EVIDENCE. I THOUGHT WE WE'VE ALSO HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE TIME ENTERED POLICY STATEMENTS BEFORE THE BOARD PER ANNUM. ADEQUATE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THE HEARING PROCESS IS FULLY TRANSPARENT THE HEARING ITSELF IS OPEN TO EVERYONE IT IS WEB CAST ON A DAILY BASIS. IN REAL TIME AND IT'S RECORDED AND THE VIDEO IS AVAILABLE I'M AT OUR WEBSITE. GENERALLY SPEAKING ALSO MIDDLE AND CORRESPONDENCE MUST BE SENT TO ALL PARTIES WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE UP OBJECTIONS MOTIONS. AND RESPOND ORALLY OR IN WRITING TO THEM TO HEARINGS PARTIES AND CAN WRIST CAN SIGN UP AND RECEIVE EMAIL UPDATES ON EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AND ALL OF ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND SUBMITTALS ARE POSTED ON. ON OUR WEBSITE. NOT SO WITH THAT AND I WILL AND I THINK IT PROVIDED A A ROADMAP TO TO WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERING AND WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU'RE LISTENING. OKAY HAS IT FOR THE PRESENTATIONS. OKAY WELL AND AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE AND AND I KNOW YOU YOU ARE YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOBS AND AND NOT REPORTING. YOU CAN TALK ALL WE TALK ABOUT THE THE PUBLIC PROCESS IN AND THE PERMITTING PROCESS CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SO SINCE HIS PROJECTS BEEN. AT GOING FOR IT IT IT JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CHANGES OF IT'S GOING TO BE. WHERE THE INTAKES ARE THERE'S TWO TUNNELS THERE IS ONE TITLE THERE'S A? A PROCESS OF TUNNELS AND NOW NOW WE'RE BACK TO TWO TUNNELS SO HAS THAT IS YOUR. HEARINGS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE CHANGES IN ANDWHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING AT NOW. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PETITION THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD AT THAT SUSTAIN RENTAL AND WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING UP THE PETITION THAT WAS SUBMITTED WE CONSIDER THAT PETITION UNTIL D. W. R. OR THE BUREAU ACTUALLY MODIFY THEIR PETITION WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING IN ADDITION TO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SUBMITTED. AS FAR AS THE TUNNEL LIMA ISSUES GO WILL CONSIDER WHAT NEXT STEPS TO TAKE WITH THE HEARING. AFTER THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION AND FOR THOSE CHANGES TO THE ALIGNMENT COME OUT SO THERE WILL BE A. LIKELY SOME ADDITIONAL PROCESS IN THE HEARING RELATED TO THOSE ISSUES. AND YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE THE PUBLIC PROCESS IN THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ON AS WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING INTO. YOU KNOW I'M A MASSIVE JPA BETWEEN AND JAY A JP BETWEEN CONTRACTORS INTO W. ARE WHERE IS THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN AND PROCESS AND THERE. BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ON THE PORT SIDE OF THE HOUSE IT'S IN OUR UP REGULATORY. A REGULATORY PROCESS REGARDING THE THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION AND THE HOME FOR ONE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO. THE ACTUAL ACTION FORMATION AND ACTIONS TIME OF THE GPL TO FOR TO EMPTY WR. OR ANYTHING AND I WOULD ADD TO SO. AS WELL AS WELL TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN ME JUST. I'M FROM THE COUNTRY BUT BUT I KNOW WHO WHO PAYS MORE GENERALLY TENDS TO HAVE A BIGGER ST THANKS ON WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOMEBODY INVESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND THEN WHEN YOU SAYING. OTHER AGENCIES WILL BE INVOLVED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEIR INVOLVEMENT WILL COME THROUGH METROPOLITAN BEING ABLE TO HAVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER THAT THEY CAN THEN SELL TO OTHER CONTRACTORS AND THEN THEREBY BE ABLE TO. HOW PART OF THAT FUNDED SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? THIS THIS JP THAT THAT THE CONTRACTORS WILL YOU KNOW BE BE PAYING FOR PART OF IT BUT TO DOUBLE OUR OWN IT. THEN IT BRINGS BACK TO THINKING ABOUT THE DEBT THAT YOU KNOW ORVILLE AND THE DAMS AND. CONTRACTORS AGAIN BEING ON YOU KNOW BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. D. W. ARE MANAGING THAT AND CLEARLY WE SAW SOME SOME ISSUES WITH THAT AND WE KNOW THOSE ISSUES ARE ON GOING. SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT AS YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT. ANOTHER MASSIVE. MULTIPLE. JP HAYES WITH PRIVATE CONTRACTORS. AND THE STATE. WHAT IS A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THAT AND? CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT SURE CHET AND THAT THESE ARE ALREADY ON. IN EFFECT WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE GETTING READY TO SIGN TODAY OR TOMORROW. AND CERTAINLY NOBODY SITTING UP HERE HAS HEARD ABOUT. THAT ST ENGAGING IN A IN A GPA WITH OTHERS OR I GUESS MISTER BLOOM SAID ANY KIND OF OVERSIGHT. OR ANY KIND OF PUBLIC PROCESS IN THAT SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT SURE. BEEN THE STATE. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE. WATER CONTRACTORS NEARLY A YEAR AGO. HAD BEEN DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL FOR. ENTERING INTO A NEW KIND OF ARRANGEMENT FOR PROJECT DELIVERY OF A PROJECT THE SIZE. AND. LAST SUMMER I BELIEVE IN JULY. AS PART OF OUR WATER FIX COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT DISCUSSED THE. CONTENTS OF A JPA OR THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE DATE OF THE JPA AND HAS HAD THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW OF COURSE. ARE AND WHAT HAPPENED THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE FALL IS. THE WATER CONTRACTORS THEMSELVES NEEDED TO GO TO THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND HAVE. THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IN THEIR PUBLIC SETTING. ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE PROJECT AND WHETHER OR NOT. IT WAS GONNA PENCIL OUT FOR THEM. AND AS YOU POINTED OUT DIE IN YOUR INTRODUCTION. THAT CONVERSATION WENT ON ALL THROUGHOUT THE FALL A WE HAD A MAJOR. CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT CONTRACTOR OPT NOT TO PARTICIPATE. ON THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION FELT THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AFTER. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON PLANNING COSTS THAT OTHER STATE WATER CONTRACTORS GO AHEAD AND. HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEIR BOARDS AND INDICATE THEIR INTEREST BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THAT HAS LED US TO THE SERIES OF VOTES THAT WE ARE NOW IN A WITH THOSE WATER BOARDS. AND CERTAINLY LEAD TO A. RENEWED INTEREST IF YOU WILL AND. AND ARRANGING FOR THE FORMALIZATION OF THIS JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SO. IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL PARTIES WERE SURE THAT THEY WANTED TO. ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE PROJECT AND THAT WE COULD DEFINE THE PROJECT AS YOU POINTED OUT MORE CONCRETELY. IN KEEPING WITH OUR OUR PETITION IN FRONT OF THE WATER BOARD THAT. THE CONVERSATION AROUND A JPA BECAME. MUCH MORE TANGIBLE SO. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS. THE STATE THROUGH ITS. EXERCISE OF A A JOINT EXERCISE OF POWER WITH THE JPA WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT MECHANISM AND ALL THE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS UP MAKING SURE THAT RISK IS MANAGED APPROPRIATELY. WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT. PROJECTS OF THE SCALE. HAVE A TRACK RECORD FOR GOING OVER BUDGET SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANTLY OVER BUDGET. WE BELIEVED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR. DIDN'T SEE IS. IT IS IS LARGE AND REFLECTIVE OF SOME OF THE RISKS IN A TUNNELING PROJECTS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON TUNNEL PROJECTS OF A COMPARABLE NATURE. TO ARRIVE AT THAT. THIRTY SIX PERCENT CONTINGENCY. SO WE BELIEVE WE'RE DOING. ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRE PLANNING. TO HELP US FROM THE BEGINNING ON CONTROL COSTS IN AND MANAGE RISKS. THE. CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION OF DOES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN OVERSEEING. THE FACILITY OF THE STATE WATER PARK THE FACILITIES OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT NOT LONG AGO WE'VE. PRESENTED TO THEM THE DEPARTMENT'S IDEAS ON ASSET MANAGEMENT. THEY'VE HAD A PRESENTATION ON OF THE OROVILLE A SITUATION AND WHAT NEEDS TO. WHAT IT NEEDS TO OCCUR? TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS OPERATED TO MAXIMUM PUBLIC SAFETY. SO THAT IS A AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSPARENT AND AND. TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT. THE JPA ITSELF A IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WILL IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR. THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE JPA PARTICULARLY ON ON DESIGN ISSUES WHICH ARE GOING TO BE A MATTER OF. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF. OF CERTIFYING OUR CONSISTENCY WITH THE DELTA PLAN THERE'S IMPORTANT DELTA AS PLACE KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS THERE. THAT WILL BE SPELLED OUT. IN IN THAT SETTING AS WELL. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A WILL BE HELPING THE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO. IMPLEMENT ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS AND I PROVIDE FOR A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT. OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND. AND PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE DESIGN. BUT BUT I MEAN I APPRECIATE. THE REITERATION DID THAT. IT IS CAN WE TALK ABOUT DELTA'S PLACE THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE DELTA WHO WHO WHO TRUST THE PROJECT. AND SO THAT THAT REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY AS YOU KNOW AS AS I. AS I AS I SIT IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND THE. THE WAY THAT CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED DON'T MAKE ANYBODY FEEL COMFORTABLE AND THE THE IDEA OF. THIS MASSIVE GPA WITH SO MANY UNKNOWNS. LEAVES A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND I THINK IT SHOULD LEAVE EVERY LAWMAKER SITTING UP HERE. WHO HAS TO WORRY ABOUT AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERRUNS I CAN TELL YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PUBLIC LOOKS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO? MANAGE THE STATE'S MONEY AND MANAGE THE STATE'S RESOURCES IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION. RUSSIANS WERE ANYONE ELSE. PHONE. UP THE SURLY REPRESENTING A COMMUNITY AND KERN COUNTY SOUTH OF DELTA AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE. NOT PUMPING WATER FROM EXISTING FACILITIES AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THE BALLOTS COMPANIONS SO PRESUME THAT CAL ARE TOUGHER Y. FACES. AND BUILD A DOZEN ABOUT LIKE DON'T DON'T WE STILL HAVE THE BY BY THOSE BIOLOGICAL PAINS AS WELL SO WHAT ASSURANCES DO WE HAVE THAT MORE WATER IS ACTUALLY GOING TO. THE DEBATE. SO I'M WE DO HAVE TO ABIDE BY BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND OF COURSE WATER FIX HAS ITS OWN SET OF BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT. STIPULATE WHEN. WE CAN MOVE WATER IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK. SIR THAT. TO ME THE MOST KIND A TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF. A PRETTY COMPLICATED SYSTEM. THAT SPEAKS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLIES IS. IN. JANUARY FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN YOU ALL RECALL WE WERE SOMEWHAT EMERGING FROM A DROUGHT WE HAD. SEVERAL A FLASHY STORMS MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND IN THAT PERIOD WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MOVE OUT WATER BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT CONFLICT. BETWEEN. SPECIES DOWN IN THE SOUTH DELTA AND AND THE LOCATION OF THOSE PUMPS SO ONCE SPECIES ARE DETECTED IN A IN THE VICINITY THAT'S WHEN. THE PROJECT OPERATORS STARTED TO TURN DOWN THE PUMPING CAPACITY. IN THAT TWO MONTH PERIOD. HAD THE TUNNELS BEEN ONLINE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE PROTECTIVE CRITERIA IN THE SOUTH DELTA. USE THE NORTH DELTA DO DIVERSIONS AND MOVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER I WANT TO EMPHASIZE DURING A TIME OF YEAR WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH WATER MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC OUTFLOW REQUIREMENTS TO MEET BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE LARGE STORM EVENTS THERE'S A LOT OF WATER MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. TO ME THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE PROJECT FOR WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY OVER TIME AS FOLKS HAVE POINTED OUT. OVERALL THIS PROJECT DOES NOT HIDE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF QUOTE UNQUOTE NEW WATER BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY. SO THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE HAVE LARGE STORM EVENTS WE CAN MOVE THAT WATER IN A WAY THAT SAFER FOR FISH. AND WE CAN STORE IT. IN LOCAL SERVICE AREAS OR IN STATE RESERVOIRS OF FOR USE DURING. WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE LONGER DROUGHT PERIODS? SO. IN TERMS OF SO IN TERMS OF JUST NUMBERS AND YOU YOU INDICATED THAT JUST EXAMPLE FROM JANUARY FABRICS Y. SIXTEEN YOU PUT YOU ESTIMATE THAT FOR EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET WOULD BE MOVED. WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN MOVED MORE INCENTIVE AT GO OUT? TWO OTHER FACILITY ONLY OUT TO THE OCEAN CORRECT CORRECT WITH. EXISTED WITH IMPROVEMENTS TO SPECIES PROTECTIONS IN THE SOUTH DELTA AND IN A WAY THAT'S SAFE FOR FISH I WITH THE OPERATION OF OF THE NEW. INTAKES. AND JUST THAT MY CURIOSITY. BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WATERS THAT WE HAVE NOW WHY ARE WE NOT PUMPING AND AND TO A LARGE CAPACITY RIGHT NOW OR HIGHER CAPACITY. WELL WE HAVE THESE INHERENT CONFLICTS OF WHEN WE HAVE SPENT AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE HAVE FISHERIES. A IN THE VICINITY OF THE PUMPS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. TO OPERATE THOSE PUMPS WITHOUT. OF HARMING THEM UNDER THAT THE DEFINITION OF A OF STATE FEDERAL LAWS IN OUR CONDITIONS ARE CONDITIONS FOR THOSE PERMITS. THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT QUALITY. CONTROLS IN THE DELTA THAT ALSO DETERMINE WHEN WE CAN I MOVE WATER OUT OF THOSE PUMPS IN THE SOUTH DELTA. THE PUMPS IN THE SOUTH DELTA ACTUALLY DRAW WATER INTO THE SYSTEM FRESH WATER INTO THE SYSTEM THAT AND A MORE NATURAL SYSTEM IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WOULDN'T BE THERE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFICIAL USES THAT HAVE. GENERATED AROUND THAT THE HOT NAMELY A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE DELTA SO THOSE WATER QUALITY RESTRICTIONS ARE ALSO. IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY ON THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF THE PROJECTS THAT. UP PREVENT THE DIVERSION OF OF MORE WATER. THE. OTHERS SAY THAT ENDED UP BECAUSE CERTAINLY THAT THE. PRO THE BENEFITS OF THE CAL WATER FIX IF THE ESTIMATES ARE CORRECT IS THAT WE DO ARE WE ARE MOVING MORE WATER. I THINK THE CHALLENGES ARE THAT IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PUMPING AND WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PUMPING. BECAUSE. OF VARIOUS REASONS AND WE BUILT A FACILITY THAT IS A PUMPING WATER AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT MOVING WATER AND OUT COMMUNITIES THAT NEED WATER ARE GETTING. AND IF I COULD JUST. THE FOLLOW UP BECAUSE SO IT IS USED IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS. GOING TO SPEND. SEVENTEEN BILLION POTENTIALLY A WHOLE LOT MORE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE SOME WATER DURING TIMES OF STORM. ARM AND AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE CAN EITHER USE IT AND AND RESERVOIRS BUT IT CAN ALSO BE BANKED HEAT TO SELL LATER CORRECT. SO A STORM WATER COULD THEN BE UNDERGROUND BANK IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SELL TO ANOTHER WATER CONTRACTOR LATER. WELL THOSE THOSE WATER CONTRACTORS ACTUALLY THEY HAVE THEIR CONTRACT AMOUNT WITH. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND WE DO HAVE A TRANSFER PROGRAM. AND. OTHERS WATER SUPPLIES HAVE TO ABIDE BY. OLIVER TRANSFER RULES. THAT REQUIRE SEQUEL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION SO I DON'T. I DON'T. CONSIDER WATER FIX PROVIDING ANY. ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY THEN. WHAT'S OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO PARTIES TODAY IN TERMS OF OF. TRANSFERRING WATER. EUROPE IN A JUST. MY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU YOU. YOU TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE COULD START RESERVOIRS IN A AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY ACTIVE ENOUGH ON. ABOUT ONE AND I NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE. THE WATER BOND WE DID AND THAT WAS A YOU KNOW. GROUP OF MONEY IN THERE FOR RESERVOIRS. AND I HEAR A LOT OF COMPLAINTS pTHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ON THAT YET. WITH THAT MONEY SET ASIDE WE'RE NOT MOVING AT AND YET WE HAVE A GOOD POTENTIALLY ANOTHER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN IN A PROJECT THAT. HAS A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WITH ITS TO. MISTER BRAZIER. SHARE. GOOD MORNING. SO WE LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT IN AND POTENTIALLY EIGHTY MILES OF TUNNELS. OF GOING THROUGH. UNPREDICTABLE SOILS GAS WELLS THOUSANDS OF GAS WELLS. THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS COMPLEX. MARRIOTT OF. SIDON SOON ALL OF THESE ISSUES GOING FORWARD WE JUST HAD A PROJECT ON HOW WE TWELVE THAT WAS FULLY ENGINEERED AND FAILED. AND THEY HAD TO RE ENGINEER AND TRY TO FIX. WHAT THEY IN ENGINEERED? AND THEN YOU AND YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE HAD MEGA PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'VE SAID THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER THAT WE PUT A RISK FACTOR IN. AND IT NEVER EVEN CAME CLOSE TO. BROWN BAY BRIDGE IS WHAT FIVE TIMES OVER. HIGH SPEED RAIL KNOWS. THREE TIMES OVER. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GO TO THE PUBLIC AND SELL THEM. THAT THAT'S GOING TO COST TAX AND THEN END UP COSTING Z.. I JUST THAT'S JUST. UNCONSCIONABLE. AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER ABILITY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF PROJECTS OF THIS ENORMITY. TO BE ABLE TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WHAT HAS A TENDENCY IS WE GET INVOLVED IN THESE PROJECTS TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND YOU GET TO THE TIPPING POINT. AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. YOU GET US INVESTED INTO A POINT WHERE WHERE WERE WOULD JUST WE HAVE TO GO ON. THAT'S NOT FAIR SOB FAIR TO US IS NOT FAIR TO THE OTHER THE TAXPAYERS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT BECAUSE OF THIS SIZE. AND THE DEBT SERVICE THAT THIS WILL. POTENTIALLY. A OCCUR. HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT WHEN YOU HAVE A SAY GOD FOR BID A DECADE? LONG DROUGHT. I AM. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I THINK IN A PART OF OUR CALCULATION IS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE COST OF NOT DOING. A PROJECT AND NOT FIXING ON THE ABILITY OF THE DELTA CONVEYANCE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE WATER SUPPLIES. AND THE CHALLENGES I I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU. AND I THINK ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING LEARNED FROM THE BAY BRIDGE AND OTHER BIG PROJECTS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE THESE OVERAGES. BUT. WE BELIEVE THAT AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THE INFORMATION. IT'S OUR OUR DUTY TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM. THAT CAN PROVIDE RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES IN. IN THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY AND THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR GOAL AS WE MANAGE THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. AND OF. CALIFORNIA'S GONNA STRUGGLE STRUGGLE ACROSS. MULTIPLE WATER SUPPLY SOURCES IN THE EVENT OF A DROUGHT. WHICH IS WHY. WE HAD OUR PROP ONE. PASSED SO SIGNIFICANTLY. TO INSURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING AND ALL OF THOSE PORT FOLIO KINDS OF WATER SUPPLIES. BECAUSE YOU KNOW REALLY THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE IS THE DIVERSITY OF THE DIVERSITY WATER SUPPLIES THAT ARE PROVIDED ACROSS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S THE. THAT'S THE BEST BULWARK AGAINST. A LONG TERM DROUGHT CLUB SCENARIO SO. I THINK OUR WHOLE CHALLENGES HOW WE MANAGE RISK AND THERE'S A RISK TO DOING NOTHING AND AFTER A DECADE OR SO IT'S OF THE STUDY IN PRE PLANNING. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT. MITIGATES RISK SHIRT CHEN GENERATES OTHER RISK IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION. BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A REASON TO TO NOT GO FORWARD UP FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OKAY. SO YOU KNOW. ALSO YOU LOOK AT. THE DELTA PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE. WHICH REQUIRES A DELTA NEEDS. CONTINUED TO BE NET AS EXPORTS OCCUR IN THIS WATER CODE SECTION ONE TWO TWO EXACTS. AND IS BOLSTERED BY THE MANDATE TO REDUCE DELTA RELIANCE. ALL EMPHASIZE REDUCED DELTA RELIANCE ON EXPORTS TO ME CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WATER NEEDS. WORKERS SECTION EIGHTY FIVE OH TO ONE. SO WHERE WE CONTINUE TO PUSH HIS AGENDA. IS NOT EVEN COMPLY WITH THEIR OWN LAWS NOW WE'VE AS THE MAN CHARITY INDICATED THIS LEGISLATURE VOTED TO PUT THE WATER BOND OUT WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT WE WERE GONNA GET STORAGE. OUT OF THAT THEN THE WATER COMMISSION NOW IS DECLARED THAT IT DOESN'T MEET THE PUBLIC NEED SO WE HAVE ONE AGENCY TELLING. US THAT WOULD WHAT WE INTENDED TO VIEWS CANNOT BE USED FOR NOW. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THESE THESE LAWS WE PUT IN PLACE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE NOT REDUCING THE NEED ON THE DELTA. NO OTHER SEAWATER AGENCIES HAVE. SAN DIEGO BUILT THEIR OWN DIESEL PLANT AT THEIR EXPENSE. AND THEY REDUCING THEIR NEED ON THE DELTA. THIS INCREASES THE NEED ON THE DELTA SO. ARE WE BREAKING OUR OWN LAWS. WELL WE ARE REQUIRED AS I MENTIONED WE DO NEED TO. PROVIDE CERTIFICATION OF CONSISTENCY WITH THE DELTA PLAN. DOCUMENTING. THIS THOUGH PROJECTS PRODUCES ALLIANCE ON THE DELTA IS GOING TO BE PART OF THAT. MOM CERTIFICATION AND OF THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT. WOULD US SEE THE BENEFIT OF THE WATER. OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT WILL BE PART OF PROVIDING THAT DOCUMENTATION AND THAT. THE. GEORGIA COUNCIL ITSELF WILL MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON. SO YOUSO YOU'RE RIGHT AND. WE ANTICIPATE DODD DESCRIBING. THE REDUCE RELIANCE OF REQUIREMENT AS IT RELATES TO THIS PROJECT. SO. FORGIVE ME THE AMBER WE TALK ABOUT OTHER AGENCIES MAKING THE DETERMINATION THOSE ARE APPOINTMENTS BY ADMINISTRATIONS. AND SO A THERE HAS BEEN A FEVERISH ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN. AB ARM. ACCOMPLISHED GOAL. A BY CERTAIN TIMES THAT. A. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THE TROUBLES ME IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ALIENATED FROM THIS PROCESS WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS HUGE INVESTMENT. GOING FORWARD IN ASISTIR ACCOMPLISH SCHOOL OF THIS LEGISLATURE. TO DO WAY IN. I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE THIS THE SEE AGENCIES ARE TELLING US WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT I CAME UP HERE TO BE. I CAME HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IS BEING SPENT AN APPROPRIATE FASHION THE BEST. OF VALUE GOING FORWARD I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A VALUE. THE OTHER THE OTHER THING IS WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER COMPONENTS I JUST WONDER WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE TOLD WHEN THEM PUMPS FOR PUTTING THAT TRACY. THIS GOING TO MAKE THE DELTA BETTER. AND THE EARLY FIFTIES OR WHATEVER THEY WERE PUT IN. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK ONE MILITANT DAM WAS INSTALLED. IN THE FRESNO AREA WHO. THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DRIVE. OR SIXTY MILES THAT WAS THE SOUTHERN PUSH TO THE DELTA. SO WE KEEP TELLING PEOPLE OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M SEEING HERE IS THAT. THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE ECONOMY WILL FLOURISH WILL A ONE THIRD OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE DAMAGED. AND THAT'S MY AREA I LIVE IN THE DELTA. SLOWLY READ A ERROR SALINITY WILL RISE IN THE DELTA. IF YOU'RE TAKING NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET KNOW WHAT IS SEVEN GALLONS. NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER MINUTE. HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF GALLONS IS THAT TAKING OUT OF THE RIVER? AND INTO CONVEYANCE. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON BRING SALINITY UP INTO THE DELTA. INTO MY FARM'S WERE MY FARMS ARE SOME OF THE CROPS ARE VERY. SALTER SALINITY SENSITIVITY CAN'T PLANT ANYMORE OR THE ABUNDANCE ASSAULTS WILL NOW BUILD UP IN THE SOILS IN THERE AND THIS WAS WILL BE. USELESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF HYDRO MODELING WHO'S DONE. BUT I MEAN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GUY. THE SALINITY BARRIER OF THE SLOUGH DEMARCATION LINE WAS THAT. THE THE CROCKETT BRIDGE. NOW THREE MILE SLOUGH. IT'S GONE UP MILES ALREADY AND WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW DIMINISH FLOWS IN ALL OF THIS. WELL YOU DIMINISH THE FLORIDA THAT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN DELTA YOU'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO HURT. THE FARMERS ARE GONNA HURT FISH BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FRESH WATER FLUSH. AND SO. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT EARTHQUAKES WAS THAT VINCE PLENTY OF EARTHQUAKES WE'VE NEVER HAD A LEVEE FAILURE TO AN EARTHQUAKE. AND WE TALK ABOUT ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. BUT WE SEE. AGAIN WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HOW YOU GET TO ACTS. BUT. WITHOUT IT CREATING A. ONE DROP OF NEW WATER. TO ME IS SO FOOLISH. WHEN WE HAVE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR PROVEN YOU TAKE A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. FIFTEEN D. SELF LANCE. FRESH WATER NEW WATER. I MEAN WE HAVE DE COMMISSION POWER PLANTS ON ARE DELTA RIGHT NOW IN PITTSBURGH IN ANY ACT THAT HAVE DISTILLING PROCESS IS. IN PLACE. THAT WE CAN UTILIZE. THERE'S THE COMMISSION BAD TO DISTILL THE WATERS WOULDN'T RUIN THEIR PIPES. SO AGAIN I SEE THIS MYOPIC PUSH TO THIS PROJECT. AND A TROUBLES ME BECAUSE. WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN SAID. IS IT OF VALUE. TO CALIFORNIA'S HOLE IT JUST SAYS THEM FLORA COMMISSION HAS TOLD US. AS WE APPROVED. PROP ONE A. THAT THE THE THE SITES RESERVOIR IN TEMPERATE SO WE HOLE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WANTED. TO GET FUNDED. IS NO VALUE TO THEM. THEREFORE OUR OPINION DIDN'T MATTER. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER AND AND I. GOT UP AT MISTER GELLER NEXT RIGHT BUT I WOULD JUST REITERATE THIS EMPLOYMENT I HEAR YOU ALL SAYING WE DON'T WORK ON THIS FOR YEARS AND I THINK. PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE IT HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS WHY YOU MYOPIC ON ONE SOLUTION WHY AREN'T WE LOOKING AT A MULTITUDE OF THANKS. MISTER GALLAGHER. SO FOR SOMEONE DID. YOU HELP ME CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT HERE BECAUSE. AS WAS SAID SEVENTEEN BILLION TO BUILD WATER FIX ESSENTIALLY. WHY NOT YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT WE BUILD BOTH SITES RESERVOIR? AND TEMPERANCE FLAT. TEMPERANCE FLAT WOULD STORE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION THERE AT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER. THAT'S ALREADY SOUTH THE DELTA. SO WE'VE ALREADY GOT IF IF WE BUILT THAT PROJECT TODAY. WE WOULD HAVE THAT WATER THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN AND MAYBE THROUGH AN EAST WEST A CONNECTION CAN NOW. COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXCHANGE WATER THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOUTH OF DELTA NEEDS. BUT THAT PROJECT NOW SITES DID GET. PUBLIC ELIGIBILITY FUNDING OF THE WATER COMMISSION. BUT TEMPERANCE GOD GROSSLY UNDERFUNDED FOR ITS PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND. SO THAT PROJECT LOOKS LIKE IT'S. VERY MUCH HAMSTRUNG. AND FOR BASICALLY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION I THINK DOES THAT TOTAL PROJECT COST. VERSES SEVENTEEN BILLION. THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET. I THINK BY WHAT YOU SAID FOR ANY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. MAYBE DEPENDING IN IN THE DELTA LATER THAT WE HAVE AN ANTICIPATED. IS NOT A BETTER BET AND A MORE. AT A BETTER USE OF OUR MONEY TO GET MORE WATER SOUTH OF DELTA TO HELP WITH NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I I THINK IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES. IN TERMS OF THE COMPARISONS HOA JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS TO CONSIDER. ONE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT. STORAGE NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE IN. AND OUR WATER FUTURE IN THE WATER COMMISSION HAD ITS PROCESS WHICH WAS. DETERMINE THROUGH THEIR REGULATORY. OF THE RULE MAKING ON HOW TO DISPERSE THAT MONEY SO IF I COULD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT KIND OF SET THAT ASIDE AT THE MOMENT BUT. BUT WATER FIX. IS YOU KNOW EFFECTIVELY A PROJECT THAT. WE BELIEVE WILL DO MULTIPLE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR WATER USERS AND FRANKLY ARE A LYNCH PIN AND A LOT OF THESE OTHER INVESTMENTS. SO ONE. IT'S GOING TO PROTECT. WATER SUPPLIES FROM AN OUTAGE. TO TO. EITHER A NATURAL DISASTER BE AN EARTHQUAKE OR ANY. A BIG MOVING STORM THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO ITS. PROTECTS THOSE WATER SUPPLIES FROM. SEA LEVEL RISE OVER TIME AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I THINK I'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST DECADE IS THAT. THE INTENSITY OF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE. IS INCREASING AT A RATE OF WE HADN'T REALLY PREDICTED. BUT BUT HERE WE ARE. FUNDAMENTALLY THE NEW INTAKES CAN MOVE WATER IN A WAY THAT'S MORE BENIGN ENVIRONMENTALLY THEN THE CURRENT. LEASE SITUATED WATER PUMPS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR DECADES. BUT. WERE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ACT ON. THE VALUE OF THIS PROJECT I THINK IS MOST APPROPRIATELY EXPRESSED. AND ALL OF THOSE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. AND WITH THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS THAT TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR SUPPLY THAT I THEY GET CONTRACTED THROUGH. OF MY DEPARTMENT ATTITUDE OF YOU ARE IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND THEY PLAN FOR HOW THEY USE THAT SUPPLY LOCALLY WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT THEY MAKE AND RECYCLED WATER. IN DESALINATION IF IT'S AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY STORE THEIR CAPTURE IS OF A KIND OF A NEW AREA WHERE WE'RE STARTING TO FOCUS ON WE NOW HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE US TO. GET OUR GROUND WATER OF BASINS CLEAN AND I TO HAVE A POINT OF SUSTAINABLE YIELD A. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES SO. I'M MOST OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA'S MANAGED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THAT SUPPLY AND IT'S THOSE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT NEED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON THEIR LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. OF THE VALUE OF OF THIS UPGRADE TO THEIR LOCAL RATEPAYERS AND THAT'S WHY THE THE PAST NINE MONTHS PLUS MONTHS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL IN. IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENING IN FRONT OF THESE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE IT THAT VALUE SHOULD SHOULD LIE AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE. RIGHT IN THAT INCIDENT THAT'S A VERY LONG ANSWER A LOT IN THERE. HOWEVER NONE OF THAT IS NOT OF THAT SAYS THAT HAVING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER RD SOUTH ADULT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. CHAIR AND WAS SITES ONLINE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SITES ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF SITES PROVIDING FLOWS TO THE DELTA. SO IF YOU HAD BOTH THOSE PROJECTS ONLINE IT WOULD DO THE SAME THINGS HE DOES MENTION FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST. AND. I WOULD POINT OUT YOUR OFFICE DID PLAY A ROLE IN THE WATER COMMISSION AS YOU WERE TO VALUE RECREATIONAL BENEFITS. WHICH YOU GAVE ZERO TEMPERANCE FLAT. AND YET YOUR OFFICE MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH. TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FOR TO TO. AND LET'S JUST BY ONE OF CLARIFY THIS BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST STATED LIKE WE WENT BACK TO THE OTHER CONTRACTORS TO SEE IF IT WOULD YOU GUYS. WE WANT TO HELP. PAY FOR THIS PROJECT. LET'S BE REAL I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT DID YOUR OFFICE AND THE ADMINISTRATION DO. TO LOBBY THESE GROUPS TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU JUST LET HIM GO BACK I THINK THERE WAS A VERY CONCERTED IN AGGRESSIVE EFFORT. TO GET SANTA CLARA WATER DISTRICTS ONBOARD AND TO GET AT METROPOLITAN. I MEAN SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW LIKE WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO TO HELP. LOBBY ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET ONBOARD WITH THIS PROJECT. WE PROVIDE OF THE SAME INFORMATION TO THEM THAT WE'VE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC ON THE VALUE OF THIS PROJECT. ON THEY DO THEIR OWN. EVALUATIONS BASED ON THEIR URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS TO ESTABLISH A THE A APPROPRIATE DEBATE FROM OTHER BOARD AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS. LEADING LOBBY THEM TO TO COME ONBOARD TO MAKE THIS PROJECT HAPPEN. THERE WASN'T AN AGGRESSIVE EFFORT ON THE BEHALF ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO ENCOURAGE THE OTHER WATER CONTRACTORS TO COME ONBOARD WITH THIS PROJECT. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY ASSERTIVE FOR A DECADE ON THE VALUE OF THIS PROJECT AND THAT HASN'T CHANGED. RIGHT AND LESS SO ON PROJECTS LIKE TEMPERANCE FLAT WHICH ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE WATER FOR. SOUTH OF DELTA CONCERNS IN FACT WHEN YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SHUT HIM DOWN AND SAID ZERO ZERO POINTS THERE. WELL WE DID A JUST THROUGH THE APPEALS PROCESS OF THE RECREATION BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH TEMPERANCE FLAT. RIGHT AND THEN SO LAST QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW YOU SAID IN YOUR PRESENTATION THAT YOU ANTICIPATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL COME ONBOARD RIGHT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. NOT ANTICIPATE YOU CAN HOPE TO FORCE OR COERCE THEM TO COME IN BECAUSE HE SHUT DOWN THEIR BIGGEST PROJECT TEMPERANCE FLAT. THEY WERE PROVIDE WATER FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND NOW HAVE NO TEN BILLION TO MAKE SURE IT'S TWO TUNNELS BUT THE IDEAS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE. A GUYS WANNA COME IN THIS PROJECT YOU CAN BUT YOU'RE GONNA PASS TO GET IN TO GET IT RIGHT. I MEAN ISN'T IS NOT SORT OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND. WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S NOT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FORCE THEM. TO COME INTO THE PROJECT IS THAT RIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE SO THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A A PROJECT BASED ON WILLING PARTICIPANTS AND MANY OF THOSE CONTRACTORS ACTUALLY WERE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS AND PAID FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS. I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS. UNIQUE TO THE US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. AND I'M HAVING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RECLAMATION COMMISSIONER TO IDENTIFY A PATH. WHEREBY A CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT CONTRACTORS WHO WOULD I REALIZE A BENEFIT FROM THE TUNNELS HAVE THEY HAVE A PATH TO INVEST IN THE PROJECT. SO. WHAT JUST WHAT MOMENT MISTER AT THAT WE ABOVE MEANT THAT WHAT MISTER PATTERSON WAS UP AND THEN MISTER FRAZIER A BIT IF I COULD JUST? I MEAN TO WHAT MISTER. MR. GALLAGHER SAYING I MEAN IT'S SIX MONTHS THAT METROPOLITAN WATER DECIDED TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THEY WERE PUTTING IN. DOUBLE. BILLIONS DOUBLE BILLIONS AND I'M IN A FEW MONTHS TIME. IN WHICH TIME SOME BILLS CAME ON VERY QUICKLY SO THAT I MEAN THAT JUST. AND PASS THE SNIFF TEST MISTER PATTERSON. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE ACT CONCERNS OF THE AND THE MAN CHAIR AND. OTHER MEMBERS HERE. WITH RESPECT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TEMPERANCE FLAT AND SITES AND. THE WATER BOND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATED. BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ABUSED IN THIS PROCESS. AND I JUST WANT TO LAY OUT. A WHAT I THINK IS A. THIS IS THIS IS A JOINT. HEARING WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I THINK THERE'S A SPLIT THEM BETTER BE A TIME A PLACE TO REAP FOR PRESS TO HOLD. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND AND THE THE WATER THAT. AB. BUREAUCRACIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT WENT FOR WHAT WENT DOWN TEMPERANCE. WE ASK FOR A MODEL. THAT WE COULD USE. WE ASK PERMISSION TO USE IT WE DID. AND IT WAS DEEMED THAT IT WAS A IT'S A TEN YEAR MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE HYDROLOGY OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. IT DEMONSTRATED. A SIGNIFICANT A OF THE BENEFITS. NOT AND YOUR DEPARTMENT. PARTICIPATED IN. UTTERLY THE. A OF ABANDONMENT OF OF EVERY. DECENT PROCESS. A ARE AT DUE PROCESS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO REDRESS LIKE THAT. A GRIEVANCE WITH. WITH WITH THE WATER COMMISSION. I DON'T I MEAN IT UP SO THAT WE GOT ZERO. FOR RECREATION. AT ZERO. FOR INCREASED FLOWS AND AND A NET BENEFIT. DOWNSTREAM TO THE TO THE. FISH HABITATS. USING. A. A WELL REGARDED. ACCEPTED MODEL. THAT WE WERE TOLD I WASN'T HEARING THREE AND HALF HOURS. THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE AND WE DID. AND IT WAS THAT THE TESTIMONY OF THE STAFF THAT ASTOUNDED US THAT THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT ENTIRE MODEL WE'RE GOING TO THROW OUT WE DON'T. BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT. AND WE HAVE ASKED ALL ALONG WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE MODEL. GIVE US A AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER WAS WE DON'T HAVE ONE. WE WERE NOT PROVIDED ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE. THE VALUE. WE THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN WESTLANDS DENIAL. OF PARTICIPATION. AND OUR DENIAL OF TEMPERANCE. AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS BORDERING ON ON ON OF ON A VERY. ALMOST DICTATORIAL APPROACH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF YOU PLAY BALL WITH THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION YOU GET THE DEAL AND IF YOU DON'T. BUT YOU YOU GET MESSED WITH AND AND TO ME THIS THIS IS I MEAN IT'S NOT COINCIDENTAL THAT SANTA CLARA. HELD OFF. THEY DID THE BOOK PERSONAL DEBT DEBT VOTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE. THEN THEY THEN THEY HOOK HOLD OFF JAYCO GETS APPROVED. AND A FEW DAYS LATER A THEY SAY HEY HERE'S A WHOLE WHOLE BUNCH MORE MONEY. IF YOU PLAY BALL WITH THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION. YOU GET THE DEAL. AND YOU GET THE WATER. AND I'M AYE I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING. TERRIBLY AMISS HERE. AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING THAT FROM THESE MEMBERS WHO. WENT TO THE BARRICADES OVER PROP ONE. WE WORKED OUR AND AND WE AND AND. WE WERE ASSURED. THAT THERE WOULD BE FAIR. A OPPORTUNITY FOR TEMPERANCE AND FOR. S. SITES IN FOR THESE. OTHERS. AND WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN AT EVERY TURN. AND THEN WE TURN AROUND AND SEE BUT JACO APPROVED AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. SANTA CLARA PROVES. WHY? SHOULD WE NOT BE SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO DO WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE REAL EVIDENCE. THAT IT IT IN THESE HEARINGS AND WITH RESPECT TO THESE PROJECTS. UP BELIES THAT TRUST. WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO TRUST THIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE SEE WHAT HAS BEEN? TAKING PLACE WITH RESPECT THE ABROGATION OF EVERY RESPONSIBILITY. WITH RESPECT TO THE TO TO THE WATER BOND AND AND. INCREASE STORAGE AND AN INCREASED WATER FLOWS. WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU? THAT A RHETORICAL. ALL DO RESPECT HER IT IS A SPECIFIC DETAILED DIRECT QUESTION CITING HISTORY AND ACTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE VERY VERY RECENTLY AND I BELIEVE SOMEBODY. PASSED A COME TO THE TABLE AND EXPLAIN TO US IN OPEN SESSION WHERE THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY JUST WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE. BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE TRUST WE SEE MANIPULATION. AND FORCE AYE I'M ASKING THE QUESTION SINCERELY AND HONESTLY WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU AND I'M GONNA ANSWER YOU SINCERELY AND HONESTLY RIGHT BACK I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSIONS. PROCESS I THINK IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF IN TERMS OF THE REGULATIONS THEY PROMULGATED AND. IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WERE GOING TO. VALUE. THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO AND. MANY PROJECTS ORIGINALLY. HAD A ZERO MARK AND THROUGH AN APPEALS PROCESS. THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN A TRANSPARENT WAY THEY WERE ABLE TO. THEY WERE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO. I'M NOT PREPARED TO GET INTO THE DETAILS TODAY ON THE RECREATION BENEFITS A TEMPERANCE FLAT I'D BE. I I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. WHEN I'M MORE PREPARED ON THAT VERY SPECIFIC TOPIC AND I WOULD WELCOME THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOU. AND I'M I'M I'M I WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT AND WOULD AND AND I THINK THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS. PARTICULARLY OF UP OF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA CAUCUS STATED THAT INTENDED TO DO THAT THAT VERY THING BUT I WANT TO REITERATE. FACTS ARE THE FACTS THAT THE MODEL WE USED WAS APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION UPON A REQUEST OF EIGHT AND APPROVED MODEL. WHEN WE DID ALL OF THE WORK. THE TESTIMONY WAS THAT THE MODEL DOESN'T. THERE IS NO GOOD ANYMORE IT'S OUTDATED AND WE SAID WHAT'S THE ADDITION WHAT WHAT. WHAT'S AN ATTORNEY THAT AND THAT A DIFFERENT MODEL. THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATE WOULD WE WE WERE NOT GIVEN ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT TEMPERANCE FLAT COULD DO BECAUSE THE VERY MODEL WAS STRIPPED FROM US AND NO ADDITIONAL DIFFERENT MODEL. WAS SUGGESTED IN FACT IN TESTIMONY THEY STATE WE HAVE NOT. HOW IS IT THAT DUE PROCESS HOW IS THAT FAIR AND HOW IN THE WORLD DOES THAT COMPORT WITH WHAT YOU JUST? TESTIFIED THAT THE WATER COMMISSION USED IT REGULATORY. DETERMINATIONS AND IT AND I AND ALL OF THAT. TO BASICALLY SAY THERE IS NO PATH FOR TEMPERANCE BLACK. BECAUSE THERE'S NO MODEL THAT'S GOING TO WORK I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE. I CAN ONLY REITERATE MY OFFER. TO HAVE A MUCH MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON THIS TOPIC WHEN I HAVE BETTER INFORMATION A LOT WHEN I'M UNDERSTAND THAT I APPRECIATED AND AND THAT AT SOME POINT I I DO. I DO THINK. AND I'M ASKING OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE. PERHAPS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE. ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMITTEE OUGHT TO HOLD SOME HEARINGS INTO THE PRECISE. PROCESS BY WHICH TEMPERANCE FLAT WAS DENIED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT DOES HUGE DAMAGE TO THE PROMISES OF THE PROPOSITION. DO WE KNOW MISTER PATTERSON. I'M UNDER ANY WITHIN EVERYBODY HERE A MINUTE. WE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY TROUBLED BY HIS TOUCH. M. MISTER FRAZIER SOMETHING ELSE BRIEFLY AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO. TO MR MATHIS AND THEN MATCH TO MR SALAS AND I'M WHEN I'M WE'RE STILL IN PANEL ONE SO WE NEED TO GET THE PANEL TO AT SOME POINT OR SAID OF HIS VERY SHORT. MS NAME IF THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS. MEDIA ORTON METEORIC. PATHWAY FOR THE WHAT EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO PUSH. THIS TWIN TOTAL PLAN. BUT IN MY DISTRICT. AND THE DUTCH SLEW. OF. WHAT'S A WATER. YOU MEDIA. WHEN WAS RESTORATION. WHICH WASN'T TITLED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WERE BREAKING GROUND THIS MONTH AND SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. FOR WETLANDS RESTORATION. SIMPLE PROJECT. OKAY. GOOD GOOD MAKE THE DELTA BETTER. BUT. YOU KNOW ALL THE SUDDEN. MISSING FUNNELS DOWN FUNNELS DOWNFALLS IN ALL IT'S NOW IT'S ON A PATH. I THINK WE NEED TO SLOW THIS THING DOWN EARLY'S ENJOYMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE NOT STUCK HOLDING THE BAG ON THIS THING BECAUSE. AGAIN. WE HAVE NO ASSURANCES THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO UP INTO THE THAT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF. AND AND IF IT DOES. THE USER SAY SO BE IT. SO. SPIKE TO SENSE. WE DO KNOW THAT THE PLANNING. DOUBLE THE COST A PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT. DOUBLING COST FROM WHAT THEY THOUGHT SO AND THAT I THINK THAT GIVES AN INDICATION OF. A THE COMPLEXITIES OF MR MATHIS AND THEN MISTER SALAS AND THEN AND. NOW I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ABOUT TEMPERATURE MOVE WE SO SAW ECHO ALL THE TEMPERANCE REMARKS. THEN A ANY GETS A A GREAT POINT ABOUT THAT THE COST OF PROJECTS IN OUR STATE DOUBLING NOW WE ARE YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH OTHER PROJECTS. ARE. MOMENTS AGO YOU SAID WILLING PARTNERS. I I FIND IT FASCINATING BECAUSE YOU'VE ALSO SAID YOU KNOW REGULATORY DEMONSTRATIONS. WORDS LIKE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WILLINGNESS. THROUGH YOU THE REGULAR TORY PROCEDURES. THAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE WITH THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS. YOU SHOULDN'T DOWN OTHER AVID. OTHER DOORS HAVE CLOSED ONLY LEAVING ONE DOLLAR OPEN. SHOW THAT THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE FORWARD TO GET WATER SOUTH THAT'S THE WILLINGNESS. AND IF. AND IN ORDER TO GET WILLING PARTNERS. YOU SHUT DOWN EVERY SINGLE OTHER OPTION. THROUGH REGULATORY DEMONSTRATIONS. YOU ONLY ONE OPTION SO. GATHER GONNA BE WILLING BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE. AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. WE DON'T NEED TO BE USING. REGULATORY DEMONSTRATIONS. TECH CUT OFF. OTHER OPTIONS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. WE WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN THIS STATE WHERE WE DID. DO. MIND FOCUS ON THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE. AND WE FORGET ABOUT EVERY OTHER OPTION OUT THERE. IN OTHER OPTIONS IN A NOT TO. GO FARTHER TO HAMMER ON ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPERANCE AND. TAKE TO GET INTO THINGS LIKE DESALINATED THINGS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVE AN EXTREME PROBLEM WITH THE DELTA WE WERE PROBLEM OF THIS PROJECT. IN. YEAH I'VE GOT I AGREE WITH ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE THERE'S SOME EXTREME CONCERN. ONE WERE USING INNER REGULATORY EFFORTS. THROUGH STATE AGENCIES. CUT OFF. ANYTHING OUT OF THE BOX. THAT IS WANTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CONCERN IS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE HEARING. WHERE WE GO THROUGH WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH TEMPERANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THERE ACTUALLY BEING SOME TRANSPARENCY? AND IN CLARITY IN THESE WATERS. THANK YOU ARE I'LL BE BRIEF. JUST BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER PATTERSON KIND OF OUTLINED A LOT OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH TEMPERANCE FLATS AND LOW. THEN THE WATER COMMISSION. BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF LEGISLATORS HERE THAT ARE FILL AND. LITTLE BETRAYED IN THE PROMISED TO DELIVER ON THESE TWO BIG PROJECTS. SO. I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF WANTING A MORE DETAILED IN DEPTH. A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT OCCURRED AND WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH HEARING I DON'T KNOW. THROUGH THE CHAIRS OR. WHETHER WE DO THAT WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR WITH THE VALLEY CAUCUS OR WITH COMPANY BASICALLY ANY LEGISLATURE THAT WAS HERE THAT VOTED FOR PROPOSITION ONE BEFORE IT BECAME PROPOSITION ONE. I'M AYE DEATHLY THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO FOLLOW UP ON. BUT ON THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW. NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THIS EARLIER UP BUT I WANTED TO JUST ASK. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF US OF THE VALLEY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE SPECIALLY WERE HELP OPEN TEMPERANCE WOULD HELP WITH THAT. WAS WATER QUALITY. WATER QUALITY AND THEN ALSO DEALING WITH THE ISSUES OF SIGMA ACT OUT THE GOVERNOR'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SIGMA PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE. BUT FOR THE WATER FIX WAS TYPICALLY HOW'RE WE ADDRESSING THOSE ALLOCATIONS WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND. IS THERE. IS OUR PURPOSE TO ADDRESSING THE WATER QUALITY ISSUES. AND DELIVERING. DELIVERING THIS WATER THEIR BECAUSE HE'D NO I'VE TALKED TO SOME FOLKS. I AND MY PART OF THE SOUTHERN INTO THE VALLEY IN THERE JUST CONCERNED WHILE. YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE PAY INTO THIS THING IS ALL THIS WATER CAN GET SHIPPED TO LOS ANGELES AND. AND TO OTHER BASINS AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S OF BENEFIT THERE AND SO IF YOU JUST KIND OF TOUCH ON THAT. FOR ME. SURE THANK YOU IN. YOUR COMMENT SOMEONE TEMPERANCE AND OTHERS ISSUES ARE DULY NOTED. IN TERMS OF THIS PROJECT ONE I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT WATER QUALITY. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN NIGHT THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS PROJECT IS IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT OVER TIME. TO HELP MANAGE THOSE ISSUES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. THAT THIS PROJECT. FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT PERSPECTIVE IS DESIGNED AROUND THE DELIVERY OF EXISTING CONTRACTED AMOUNTS WHICH ARE TABLE A CONTRACTED AMOUNTS IF YOU WILL. AND SO THOSE PARTIES THAT HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. UP THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT THEY WILL GET THEIR ALLOTTED BENEFITS. FROM WATER FIX. IT'S THERE IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE YOU'LL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY ON THE NEXT PANEL BUT. THERE'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE MAT METROPOLITAN FINANCING OF THE REMAINING PORTION FOR THEM TO GET MORE WATER THAN THEIR CONTRACTED AMOUNT. SO. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ANSWER TO TO THAT QUESTION AND I AM ALSO TALKING WITH A LOT OF FOLKS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY ABOUT HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE AND. I BELIEVE WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM. OKAY. THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. PANEL. A WITH THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY AND THEN OUR NEXT PANEL PAL NUMBER TWO. JEFFREY CUDDLING HER GENERAL MANAGER BETTER POULTON WATER DISTRICT. JENNIFER. PIERRE GENERAL MANAGER STATE WATER CONTRACTORS BONTA TOLLEY. CHAIR OF THE DELTA COUNTIES COALITION. DOG. BG STATE ATTORNEY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND OSHA MISTER. ATTORNEY REPRESENT ADULT AGENCIES. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY. CUTTING WOULD LIKE START. I THINK VERY MUCH OF CHAIRS EGGMAN. CHAIRS BLOOM IN GARCIA. PROJECT OPPORTUNITY COME HERE AND SPEAK UP MY NAME IS JEFFREY TIGHTLY AROUND THE GENERAL MANAGER SEAL THE MATCH POINT WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I JUST LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHO WE ARE OF WHAT'S OUR WATER SUPPLY SITUATION LOOK LIKE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND AND WHY ARE AGENCY TOOK ITS ACTION OF THAT IT TOOK IN APRIL TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. SO MUCH BUT WATER DISTRICT IS THE WATER WHOLESALER OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE WATER USED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SERVE THE COUNTIES OF ALL THE COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO AND PORTIONS OF BEEN TERRORISTS ITEMS HAMBURG MEDINA. THIS SIX COUNTY SERVICE AREA HAS NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON IT AFFECTIVELY WE SERVE WATER TO THROUGH OUR MEMBER AGENCIES TO ONE IN EVERY TWO CALIFORNIANS. ANDA ROUGHLY THAT'S ONE EVERY SIXTEEN AMERICANS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY ALSO RESIDES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKE IT'S THEIR WATER. UP THROUGH METROPOLITAN. THE WATER THAT MUCH FUN PROVIDES COMES FROM TWO PLACES PRIMARILY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTED FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT METROPOLITAN IMPORTS THROUGH ITS COLORADO RIVER ACT WITH ACT UP BRINGING IT IN. AND YOU SERVING THOSE TWO SUPPLIES BLENDING THEM AND DELIVERING THEM THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF WATER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A SMALL PIECE THAT COMES THAT IS JUST THE CITY OF LA IS THAT IS IMPORTED FROM THE OWENS VALLEY. ROUGHLY FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF THE REGION'S WATER AND THE REST IS OUR LOCAL NATIVE WATER THROUGH OUR GROUND WATER BASINS AND OURS RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL. OUR BOARD A DECIDED TO INVEST IN WATER FIX. THIS LAST APRIL. WE ACTUALLY HAD THE CITED IT PREVIOUSLY TO DO IT IN OCTOBER AD THAT WAS A DIFFERENT FORMAT BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT A CBP PORTION OF IT ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BEEN FINANCED BY CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT CONTRACTORS. THEN WE TOOK IT MATTER UP AGAIN WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THEY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN APRIL. AND OUR BOARD LOOKED AT TWO OPTIONS ONE IS BUILDING HELPING THE STATE FINANCE A SMALLER OPTION A ONE TUNNEL TO WHEN TAKE OPTION. THE OR FINANCE THE ENTIRE PROJECT WHERE WE WOULD PICK UP THAT CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION AND USE. TO SEE A THAT DOESN'T INVESTMENT. I WE LOOKED AT IT OUR BOARD LOOKED AT IT FROM ABOUT FIVE MAIN ISSUES OF THAT WERE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US. ONE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THOUGH IS THE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY THE PROJECT PROVIDED. WE ARE HAVE BEEN LOSING WATER SUPPLY FROM STATE WATER PROJECT IT'S THIRTY PERCENT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUPPLY. THE PROJECT HAS ROUGHLY LOST ABOUT A THIRD OF ITS RELIABILITY TO TWO ENDANGERED SPECIES S. CUTBACKS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. THIS PROJECT HELPS REVERSE THAT IT HELPS TURN THAT AROUND. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT A CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD WERE IN A CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD OF RAIN AND LESS SNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF WAITING FOR THE SNOW TO MELT AND PICK UP AND PUMP YEAR ROUND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP WATER. IN SHORT BURSTS AND MOVE IT INTO STORAGE AND MOVE THAT INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY ENDANGERED SPECIES IMPACTS A CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. AND THEN FINALLY WATER QUALITY HUGELY IMPORTANT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR GROUND WATER BASINS NEED THAT FRESH WATER OF STATE WATER PROJECT. ARE COLORADO RIVER WATER IS SIGNIFICANTLY SALTIER THAT'S WHY WE BLEND THE TWO AND WE CAN USE IT FOR BOTH OUR RECYCLING PROGRAMS ARE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND PUTTING THAT WATER INTO OUR GROUND WATER BASINS. AND THEN FINALLY THE GOVERNOR STRESSED WITH US. ATTENTION THE LAY UP WE WERE LOOKING AT A WE'VE WORKED ON THIS PROJECT FOR A DECADE WE HAVE INVESTED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY AS WATER. MANAGERS TO STUDY THIS PROJECT AND COME UP WITH THE PROPOSED PROJECT. AFTER A DECADE OF ANALYSIS. MOVING TO A ONE TUNNEL INSTEAD OF TWO TUNNELS MOVING TO A PARTIAL SOLUTION INSTEAD OF A FULL SOLUTION. UP POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD MORE REVIEW MORE ANALYSIS MORE STUDY. BUT MY BOARD WAS FED UP WITH DELAY FED UP WITH THIS DECADE WE SPENT WORKING ON THIS AND THEY WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD. SO CONSIDERING ALL THAT THEY DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD. NOW DOES HAVE WE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY AT THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THAT. THE PROJECT COST METROPOLITAN. ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS PER HOUSEHOLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHAT THE FULL TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR FINANCING LEVEL. IF WE DID JUST OUR SHARE OF IT IT WAS TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS PER HOUSEHOLD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A MONTH. THAT'S AFTER THE FULL BUILD OUT ITSELF BLARED IN OVER A DECADE SO IT GOES AND IT ROUGHLY. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE CENTS A MONTH FIFTY CENTS A MONTH AND THEN THAT BUILDS UP TO THAT AMOUNT. THAT WAS LOOKED AT IS THAT AFFORDABLE FOR OUR REGION WE DO SPREAD ACROSS A BIG BASS OVER SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE. THAT FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN WE LOOKED AT. ADDING IT AGAINST THE CELL ADDING AGAINST DISTRIBUTIVE STORM WATER CAPTURE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER THAN THOSE. IT DOESN'T DISPLACE THOSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE ABOVE WERE VERY PROUD OF OUR TRACK RECORD IN NINETEEN NINETY WE SERVED FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. WITH AND MUCH PALM SOLD TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET. TODAY WE SERVE NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE AND WE'RE GONNA SELL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION ACRE FEET. WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON IMPORTED WATER WATER FROM THE DELTA. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REPLACED OVERNIGHT UP A DIESEL PLANTS. WOULD BE BETWEEN LA AND SAN DIEGO TO REPLACE OUR STATE WATER PROJECT WATER WOULD BE A DIESEL PLANT EVERY THREE MILES IT WOULD TAKE FIFTY DIESEL PLANTS OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT WITH THE CELL ON. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE ABILITY TO REPLACE THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUR WATER SUPPLY IN A GENERATION WITH THOSE OTHER TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO ALL THAT OUR BOARD IS LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO INVEST. WHEN WE PASSED OUR APRIL BOARD UP ACTION TO BILL INVEST TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN HELL WATER FIX. WE PASSED OUR SECOND LARGEST AMOUNT OF CONSERVATION FUNDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE PUTTING INTO CONSERVATION OVER THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE. WE ALSO INVESTED IN A THE LARGEST REGIONAL RECYCLED WATER PLANT IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH LA COUNTY SAN DISTRICTS AND WE COMMITTED FINANCING TO THAT. SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO AN OLD THE ABOVE FINANCING APPROACH. BUT CALIFORNIA WATER SIX IS PART OF THAT NECESSARY PORTFOLIO IN A CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. A. IT DIDN'T MAKE IT LOOK GOOD OF A MISCARRIAGE IT JUST INTERESTING I MEAN. IT TALK ABOUT HOW. MUCH WHAT WE USED TO USE AND HOW MUCH REASON NOW ANNA MEAN THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID FOR ANYTHING RIGHT TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND IF WE DON'T JUST LOOK AT ONE SOLUTION. THAT MANY OTHER THINGS OPEN UP HOW OFTEN ALSO OFFER YOU PROBABLY IN NINETEEN NINETY YOU ARE DRIVING A CAR THAT GOT FIVE TO. TEN MILES TO THE GALLON AND NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY DRIVING ONE THAT YOU DID NOT USE ANY GAS RIGHT. POTENTIALLY SOME TO SING BUT OVER THE OVER THE SCANNING YEARS AS WE GRAPPLE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THE WAY WE USE OUR RESOURCES CHANGES. HELLO MISTER. THANK GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY BY NAME JENNIFER PIERRE AND I SERVE AS THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. A WE ARE AN AGENT ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS I'M TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT BRING WATER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FINE YOU JUST HEARD FROM MR KITE WINGER HE IS HE REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR LARGEST MEMBERS METROPOLITAN BUT. WE ACTUALLY OF OUR ORGANIZATION OF LARGE AND SMALL PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES. THAT ARE VERY DIVERSE REPRESENTING URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL. A REGION'S. SEVERAL OF THEM INCLUDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING AREAS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE MOJAVE DESERT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE. HOWEVER TOGETHER WE DO STRIVE TO DELIVER CLEAN RELIABLE SAFE WATER IN THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION TO DELIVERING WATER WE ALSO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH PARTICULAR IN THE DELTA AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. WE ANNUALLY SPEND OUT OF MY ORGANIZATION TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO DIRECTLY FUND SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES AND RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DELTA INCLUDING INVESTING IN THINGS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL DNA UNDERSTANDING ON HOW. FOOD I'M IS. MOVING IN THE DELTA HOW FISHER USING IT. AS WELL AS HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THE DELTA SMELT AND SALMON RESILIENCY STRATEGIES I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT THIS ORGANIZATION THAT'S MAKING THESE COMMITMENTS. JUST OVERVIEW THE STATE WATER PROJECTS I'M IT IS A COMPLEX NETWORK OF CANALS AND RESERVOIRS. OF PUMPING FACILITIES TUNNELS HYDROELECTRIC PLANTS AND RESERVOIRS AND IT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED SIXTY YEARS AGO. TODAY TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THEIR WATER FROM THIS PROJECT. AND THAT INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND IS IRRIGATED USING STATE WATER PROJECT WATER. HOWEVER IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL BE ON PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE. AND AS SUCH WE DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE TO PROVIDE THIS RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY. WE ARE FACING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT TODAY IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WE ALSO HAVE AGING AND VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH I THINK WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. AND WE HAVE A VOLATILE CLIMATE AHEAD AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF. REPORTS AND ARTICLES ESPECIALLY EVEN IN THE LAST WEEK AND IN FACT TODAY IN THE BE ON WHAT THIS A CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN EXPERIENCING. THIS CLIMATE WHIPLASH ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN WETTON DRYERS REQUIRES THAT WE THINK MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND MANAGE AGAINST. THAT WHIPLASH. SO WE THINK WATER FIX DOES PROVIDE THAT PRUDENT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND FLEXIBLE RELIABLE SOLUTION TO MANAGING ABOUT FUTURE CONDITION. I AS I DIRECTOR NEMETH MENTIONED BE E. AYE ARE PREPARED BY W. ARE. INCLUDES A MITIGATION OF MODERN PLANETS THREE HUNDRED PAGES LONG. IT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ADOPTED MEASURES THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT I'M HOUSE ADOPTED TO AVOID AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT INCLUDING. PROTECTING IN STABILIZING LEVEES BEFORE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS IN THE DELTA. AS SHE ALSO MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL E. IR WHICH IS THE WHOLE PURPOSE. IS TO EVALUATE EFFECTS OF REDUCED IMPACTS ON WETLANDS EVEN BEYOND WHAT WAS ALREADY. REDUCED IN THEIR. ME THAT FIRST THE IR. THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO AVOID TO MITIGATE THE LOCAL IMPACTS AS. SHE ALSO MENTIONED THOSE INCLUDE IMPACTS AGRICULTURAL LANDS RECREATION AND TRANSPORTATION. ALONG WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT ZONE SEVEN AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT TO HAVE. TAKEN VOTES TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE BALANCE OF OUR AGENCIES WILL CONSIDER THIS AND IN THEIR PUBLIC. BOARD MEETINGS AS THEY ARE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES TO MAKE THEIR RESPECTIVE DECISIONS. THEY EACH HAVE TO CONSIDER THEIR OWN LOCAL NEEDS THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT. IS OF VARYING A PORTION OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS SO THEY WILL CONSIDER. THIS WATER FIX AS PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO AND THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGY. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN THEIR RESOLVE TO STUDYING THE OPTIONS LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES. AND AND MAKING THESE. INVESTMENTS AND UP AND UP PUBLIC AND OPEN MANNER. I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT WATER FIXES NOT OF THE ONLY. PROJECT THAT THESE AGENCIES ARE PURSUING. AS I MENTIONED WE ARE RICOCHETING BETWEEN DROUGHT AND ATMOSPHERIC STORMS. REQUIRED US TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND HOW THESE AGENCIES ARE. MANAGING THEIR OWN PORTFOLIOS. SO WHILE WATER FIX IS. ADVANCING OUR AGENCIES CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND OTHER PROJECTS WE'RE NOT PICKING ONE SOLUTION OVER ANOTHER. OF WE'VE IN FACT I'M RATHER MORE STORAGE WAS BROUGHT UP ELEVEN OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTOR MEMBER AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN THE SIGHTS OF THE OR. SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OF. PROTECTING THE WHAT THEIR WATER SUPPLIES IN FACT. EVEN THE STABLE WATER SUPPLY THE SURFACE SUPPLY THAT WATER FIX WILL ESSENTIALLY STABILIZE. IS NEEDED TO STABILIZE GROUND WATER BASINS THAT THE REALLY Q. FACTOR IN THE ABILITY FOR SIGNAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR OTHER AGENCIES ARE DOING. FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T WATER AGENCY IS NOW RECYCLING ALMOST ALL OF ITS WASTE WATER FOR IRRIGATION. AND PERCOLATES ITS TREATED WASTE WATER RECHARGE THE LOCAL GROUNDWATER BASIN AND PUSHES AGGRESSIVELY ON ITS CONSERVATION AWARENESS PROGRAMS. COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IS IMPLEMENTING A GROUND WATER REPLENISHMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. IN ADDITION TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CONSERVATION PROGRAM FUNDING AND AN AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO PUT MORE CUSTOMERS ON RECYCLED WATER. THE SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IS INVESTED MILLIONS AND WHETHER BASED IRRIGATION CONTROLLERS GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROGRAMS TURF REMOVAL. CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND DEMONSTRATION GARDENS IN REBATES MOJAVE WATER AGENCY HAS INVESTED IN RECHARGE FACILITIES IN MULTIPLE GROUND WATER BASINS. AND DEVELOP STORAGE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE RELIABLE SUPPLIES. IN PARALLEL THEY'VE EXECUTED AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION THROUGH. MEASURES RESULTING IN A THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT DECLINE IN PER CAPITA BECAUSE PER CAPITAL GAINS. SO WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO DO MORE LOCALLY AND THEY WELL IT DOESN'T MEAN NEGATE THE NEED FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THE STATE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX PROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLY. SO I THINK WITHOUT. ALL BE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS OR WE'RE GOING. EGGMAN MISTER UNTIL HE. MORNING CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN EGGMAN AND. CHAIR. CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE I'M DONNA TOLD HIM A LONG TIME MEMBER THE SECOND COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ON BEHALF THE DELTA COUNTIES COALITION THIS MORNING. COMPRISED OF THE TOWNS OF SACRAMENTO YELLOW SOLANO SAN JOAQUIN CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. WE REPRESENT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS FIVE ARE THOUSAND WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE DELTA. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT YOU AS LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ARE GIVING TO THE WATER MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES IN OUR REGION OR STATE THE FOCUS YOU BRING TO IT THIS MORNING. RECENTLY I PROVIDED TESTIMONY AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AS A PART OF THE. A PHASE TWO OF THE CHANGE APPOINT DIVERSION PROCESS. AT THAT HEARING I DISCUSS THE REASONS THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA. ARE IMPORTANT TO THE REGION AND TO THE ENTIRE STATE WHY IT WARRANTS LONG TERM PROTECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY AS REFLECTED IN TWO DAYS DISCUSSION PRESENTATION. I THINK IT'S APPARENT THAT THE STATE A PART A WATER RESOURCES AND HIS PARTNERS. INTENDED CONTINUE PRESSING FORWARD BUT THE PERMITTING PROCESS AN AUTOMATIC CONSTRUCT THE TWIN TUNNELS. FOR TEN YEARS THE FIVE DELTA COUNTIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY VOICE OUR CONCERNS. BUT THE STATE'S LESS THAN TRANSPARENT EFFORT TO FIX THE DELTA. FIRST WITH A BEADY CP. AND NOW WITH CALIFORNIA WATER FIX. JOSE MAKE NO MISTAKE. PROPOSED PROJECT WELL FAR REACHING. NEGATIVE AN EVERLASTING IMPACTS TO THE. TO THE DELTA. ESSENTIALLY WE BELIEVE IT AMOUNTS TO WATER GRAB. IT PUTS THE FIVE DELTA COUNTIES IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF A LONG LIST OF IRREVERSIBLE IMPACTS. SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS INCLUDE. IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES TO THE WAY OF LIFE IN THE DELTA. YOU IN GREAT PART TO THE INCESSANT OFF THE ROUND THE CLOCK TRUCK TRAFFIC. NORWAY'S AIR QUALITY DEGRADATION IT CARRIER DETERIORATED ROADWAY CONDITIONS THE VARIETY OF CONSTRUCTION LATE ACT IMPACTS SOME OF THEM LAST A DECADE OR EVEN LONGER. IMPACT AGRICULTURE. ECONOMICALLY IT WILL AFFECT IN DESTRUCTIVE PROP SALES THE PRODUCTION. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IMPACT THE ENTIRE REGIONAL FARM ECONOMY IN THE DELTA. IT ALSO DEGRADES THE RECREATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES. VIA THE NORWAY'S BE. ACCESS ISSUES THE DEGREE OF INTEGRATION OF AND VISUAL INTRUSION TO THE ENVIRONMENT. RIVER NILE DELEGATION WILL BE SO VERY CONSTRAINED ESPECIALLY NEAR THE PROPOSED INTAKE LOCATIONS FOR YEARS ON END. I THINK LASTLY THERE MANY IMPACTS BUT SONY LOST DELTA'S GENERATION. IT ALL ALONG. IT LEGACY ALL MANY MANY GENERATIONS OLD LONG LEGACY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THEIR COMMUNITIES OF HEARD. CORTLAND LOCK IN WHILE THE GROVE. THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE PEOPLE YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN MIND. THE CALL THE DELTA HOME ARE WORTHY OF LONG TERM PROTECTIONS. IT SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECTED TO YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF UNBEARABLE CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS. THE SEGMENT OF SILICON DELTA REFORM ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINE. ESTABLISHED A CO EQUAL GOALS AS ALL OF YOU KNOW. IT MANDATED ESTABLISHED A POLICY TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON WATER EXPORTS THE DELTA. ENCOURAGED INVESTMENT IN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER BY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. CALIFORNIA WATER FIXES FOCUSED ON INCREASING WATER EXPORTS FROM THE DELTA AND DOES NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO REDUCE DIVERSIONS INVEST AND REGAL SUPPLIES. I MUST SAY WE ARE VERY SKEPTICAL OF HOW. WELL THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO PROVE AS I HEARD EARLIER. REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX PERMITTING PROCESS. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE BETTER MORE COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND ADDRESS THE COLECO GOALS. ALL ARE FREE PROTECTIONS FOR THE DELTA AS WELL. THESE COULD INCLUDE IN DO INCLUDE INVESTING A STATEWIDE A REGIONAL WATER STORY THAT WAS DISCUSSED HERE THIS MORNING. UPGRADE THE STATE WATER PROJECT CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT A HARD LOOK AT THAT. INVESTING IN THE LEVY SYSTEM THE CURLY EXIST. I THINK THE BILL OFF THE LOSS THAT EVEN WITH CALIFORNIA WATER FIX AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT A TARGET RELY ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM. YOU TRANSMIT AND CONVEY WATER THROUGH THE DELTA. WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS FROM CONSERVATION OF WATER USE EFFICIENCY. WE NEED DEVELOP REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION STRATEGIES. A COMPREHENSIVE AND TRANSPARENT WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN MUST IN OUR VIEW PROVIDE A SECURE WATER SUPPLY. AND ASSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF SUPPLY. AND NOT JUST FORGET SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR OTHER REASONS A STATE BEFORE THE FORM DOING CALIFORNIANS WHO RESIDE IN OUR FIVE COUNTIES IN THE DELTA. WE SHOULD ALL AGREE THAT THE DELTA IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IN ACKNOWLEDGE IT BECAUSE HOME TO MANY PRECIOUS IN UNIQUE RESOURCES. BUT BE NO REDIRECTED ADVERSE IMPACTS ASSOCIATE WITH A WATER SUPPLY SOLUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN OTHER WORDS DON'T SACRIFICE A DELTA FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE. ALL THIS REPEAT WHAT I DON'T SACRIFICE THE DELTA. TO BENEFIT OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE DELTAS RESOURCE IS A STATEWIDE ASSETS. ARE PROTECTED FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO HEAR THIS MORNING THAT JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES WILL BE FORMED WITH NO LOCAL REPRESENTATION. AND THERE WILL NOT ONLY OUT INSULT INJURY. BY CONSTRUCTING A PROJECT BUT THEY WILL DESIGN BUILD AND FINANCE THE PROJECT THERE ARE FRONT AND BACKYARDS. WE SUPPORT THE STATE LEGISLATURES A ROLL AND CERTAINLY RESPECTED IN PROTECTING THE DELTA. AND WE SUPPORT YOUR OVERSIGHT AND I CAN ENGAGEMENT IN THIS PROCESS. IN OUR VIEW THERE IS NO DEBATE. THIS DOCUMENT SAN JOAQUIN DELTA IS A VALUABLE IN IRREPLACEABLE RESOURCE WHAT MANY. SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES. IT WARNS LONG TERM PROTECTIONS. ANY FUTURE WATER MANAGEMENT OR LAND USE POLICY CHANGES SHOULD NOT IN OUR VIEW CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIMINISHMENT OR DESTRUCTION OF THE DELTA. WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX. AND SO DOES ALL OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL OF HIS MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY ADDRESS YOU. IN ANY EVENT YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU RESIDE IT'S ONLY HAVE DONE SO RESIDE ADULT IT DOES SO. THE DELTA COUNTY'S COALITION WELCOMES YOU TO FOR TWO OR THE DELTA TO EXPERIENCE THE AWESOME WONDER. THIS VERY SPECIAL PLACE. THAT WE KNOW IS WORTH PROTECTING AND SAVING. WE WANT TO BE APART A SOLUTION WE STAND READY TO BE A PARTNER. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PRINT TITLES A CALIFORNIA WATER FIX IS THE ANSWER. THANK YOU MUCH SUPERVISOR. I'M PRUNING. MR. OKAY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOUG BG I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN IT WHEN I FIRST BEGAN WORKING ON THE BAY DELTA CONSERVATION PLAN THAT BECAME WATER FIX. AN RTC STRONGLY OPPOSES THE WATER FIX PROJECT BECAUSE FOR THREE REASONS WHICH I WANT TO DISCUSS TODAY. FIRST THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THE DEGRADED STATUS QUO FOR FISH THAT MIGRATE THROUGH THE DELTA DESPITE HOW BAG CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE. SECOND THE FINANCING FOR THIS PROJECT WILL DIVERT MUCH NEEDED FUNDING AWAY FROM REALISTIC LOCAL WATER SUPPLY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE PART ON THE DELTA. AND THIRD. THAT THE FINANCING SCHEME FOR WATER FIX APPEARS TO VIOLATE STATE AND FEDERAL THE STATE LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT RACE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE FINANCING. JUST A STEP BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ENERGY C. ACTUALLY PROPOSED WHAT WE CALL THE PORTFOLIO ALTERNATIVE FOR THE DELTA WHICH INCLUDED A SINGLE TUNNEL AND NEW INTAKE ON THE NORTH DELTA. NEW. INVESTMENTS IN LEVY STABILITY AND STORAGE SOUTH OF THE DELTA AN OPERATING RULES THAT WOULD REDUCE DIVERSIONS FROM THE DELTA IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT BUT WOULD BE PAIRED WITH INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES. AND THE STATE REFUSED TO EVEN STUDY THIS AT ALL IT WAS REJECTED OUT OF HAND SO ENERGY SEE DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL JUST SAY NO POSITION ON THE TUNNELS. WHAT WE HAVE EVALUATED THIS A SPECIFIC PROJECT BEFORE US IN THE SPECIFIC PROJECT IS BAD FOR THE DELTA AND IS BAD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? THE BAY DELTA IS AN ECOLOGICAL CRISIS WE'VE WATCHED FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT HAVE BEEN NATIVE TO THIS AREA FOR GENERATIONS MILLENNIUM. ON THE VERY BRINK OF EXTINCTION DUE TO HABITAT LOSS OVER DIVERSION OF WATER ENTRAINMENT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER FACTS. AND YET DESPITE HOW BAD THE STATUS QUO IS. AND IT'S REALLY BAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY WHEN WE INITIATED CONSULTATION TO REDO THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM TWO THOUSAND ANDTWO THOUSAND NINE. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IMPLEMENTED DURING THE DROUGHT AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT LISTED SPECIES. AND YET DESPITE HOW BAD THE STATUS QUO IS FOR NATIVE FISH LIKE SALMON. WATER FIX IS ACTUALLY WORSE. THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND THE INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE MAKE CLEAR. THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX PROJECT WILL REDUCE SURVIVAL OF SALMON THROUGH THE DELTA COMING DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER DESPITE HOW BAD CONDITIONS ARE TODAY. WILL REDUCE THE ABUNDANCE OF LONG THIN SMELT A STATE THREAT LISTED THREATENED SPECIES. DUE TO INCREASED DIVERSIONS. IT WILL HARM AND REDUCE THE ABUNDANCE OF DELTA SMELL. SO FOR THE MOST CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA WATER FIX IS ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THE STATUS QUO. AND ALSO HARM FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON WHICH FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE'S SALMON FISHERY. TODAY THE US FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE ISSUED A BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT AMAZINGLY ONLY COVERS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT IT DOES NOT EVEN AUTHORIZE OPERATION OF THIS PROJECT. AND THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE BIOLOGICAL OPINION ONLY OPERATE AUTHORIZES OPERATIONS TO THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS BEFORE THE PROJECT WOULD EVEN BE COMPLETELY CONSTRUCTED. AND SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PERMITS FOR THIS PROJECT REALLY DO NOT PROVIDE OPERATIONS IN THE LONG TERM OR ANY CERTAINTY ABOUT WATER SUPPLY. IN ADDITION THERE ARE NUMEROUS CHALLENGES TO THOSE EXISTING PERMITS AND TO THE SECRET DOCUMENTS MORE THAN TWENTY PARTIES HAVE FILED. LITIGATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AND IN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. US SEVERAL PARTIES INCLUDING PARTIES REPRESENTED BY THAT AFTER RESOURCE DEFENSE COUNSEL HAVE CHALLENGE THOSE FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS THE STATE CALIFORNIA. SHE'S MADE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PERMITS. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES THERE'S A GREAT LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE OR MORE OF THOSE LITIGATION WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN INVALIDATING PERMITS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT PROTECT. OUR ENDANGERED FISH AND WILDLIFE. MOREOVER. AS YOU HEARD THIS MORNING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IS STILL CONSIDERING THE PETITION TO CHANGE THE POINT A DIVERSION. AND THE BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPOSE APPROPRIATE FOR CRITERIA WHICH ARE TO BE INFORMED BY HE TWENTY TEN PUBLIC TRUST FLOWS REPORT. WHICH REQUIRED WHICH FOUND THAT THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. WOULD JUSTIFY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DIVERSIONS AND INCREASE FLOWS THROUGH THE DELTA TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THIS ESTUARY WE NEED TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND REDUCE DIVERGENCE AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WATER FLOWING THROUGH THE ESTUARY. AND YET WATER FIX DOES THE OPPOSITE. ANY PARTICULAR WATER FIX PROPOSES TO INCREASED DIVERSIONS DURING THE DRY AND CRITICALLY DRY YEARS AND ACTUALLY WILL NOT INCREASED DIVERGENCE DURING THE WET YEARS. BECAUSE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SOUTH ADULT OF STORAGE WE SIMPLY CAN'T MOVE MORE WATER IN A YEAR LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SECOND THERE ARE. SIGNIFICANT COST EFFECTIVE LOCAL SUPPLY OPTIONS. TYPICALLY IN URBAN AREAS THAT THE FUNDING FOR WATER FIX JEOPARDIZES. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HISTORICALLY VOTING AGAINST FUNDING BETWEEN TUNNELS PROJECTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD ACTUALLY DIVERT THE NEEDED FUNDING AWAY FROM THOSE SOLUTIONS LIKE INCREASED WATER RECYCLING STORM WATER CAPTURE. IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND OTHER LOCAL SUPPLY PROJECTS. AS YOU HEARD THE DELTA REFORM ACT REQUIRES US TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA. AND AN RTC HAS PREPARED A NUMBER OF REPORTS IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN UNTAPPED POTENTIAL REPORT. WHICH IDENTIFIED MILLIONS OF ACRE FEET OF POTENTIAL NEW WATER SUPPLIES FROM WHICH WATER RECYCLING IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND STORM WATER CAPTURE. AND ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN MISMATCH REPORT WHICH FOUND THAT AS COMPARED TO THEM URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS OF ITS MEMBER AGENCIES. METROPOLITANS URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN OVERESTIMATES DEMAND FOR IMPORTED WATER UNDERESTIMATES LOCAL SUPPLIES AND CREATES THE PERSON THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. DIVERSIONS FROM THE DELTA WHILE SUSTAINING THE ECONOMY. WHAT A FIX IS GOING TO COST WATER DISTRICTS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS? THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS INCLUDING FINANCING IS AS MUCH AS FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. AND THAT FUNDING IS MONEY THAT CANNOT BE SPENT ON THESE LOCAL SUPPLY PROJECTS. FINALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE FINANCING SCHEME FOR WATER FIX VIOLATE STATE LAW. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES FILE THE ACTION IN SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT TO VALIDATE. NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO PAY FOR THE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SHARE OF WATER FIXED COSTS THAT IT WAS ANTICIPATED THE STATE WATER PROJECT WILL PAY FOR. HOWEVER AS YOU'VE HEARD THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT CONTRACTORS HAVE REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION IS NOT PARTICIPATE. AS A RESULT METROPOLITAN IS VOTED TO PAY FOR NEARLY TWICE A THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT IN WATER FIX. PAYING FOR NEARLY TEN BILLION OR ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THE TOTAL COST DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD ONLY GET TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WATER SUPPLY FROM THIS PROJECT. THAT RAISES SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT A. WHETHER METROPOLITANS VOTE ACTUALLY IS PROTECTING RATEPAYERS ORDERS PUTTING REPAIRS IN VIOLATION OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY SIX BY PAYING FOR MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF THE PROJECT. IN ADDITION. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT THE FINANCING FOR THIS PROJECT ASSUMES THAT STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS CAN CONTINUE TO PAY FOR IT THROUGH. PROPERTY TAXES AT LOWER PROPERTY TAXES HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ARGUMENTS THAT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PROHIBITS THAT WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE PUBLIC. THE NINETEEN SEVENTY A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT REQUIRES THAT ABOUT TO THE PUBLIC BE. BE MADE BEFORE THERE ARE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS TO PAY FOR THE ACQUISITION OR IMPROVEMENT OF REAL PROPERTY. IN THE VALIDATION ACTION ENERGY SEE AS ONE OF MANY PARTIES WHO IS CONTESTING DELIVERY OURS AT THE ALREADY HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THESE. ARE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROTECTIONS FOR RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS. DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES FILED A DEMURRER TO THOSE TO ARE ANSWER WHICH WAS DENIED AND WE EXPECT THIS LITIGATION WILL CONTINUE. ULTIMATELY ENERGY SHE OPPOSES THE WATER FIX PROJECT BECAUSE IT IS WORSE THAN THE STATUS QUO ENVIRONMENTALLY. BECAUSE IT DIVERTS MUCH NEEDED FUNDING AWAY FROM REALISTIC SOLUTIONS AND BECAUSE THE FINANCING SCHEME APPEARS TO BE INVALID AND RAISES SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS. CO EQUAL GOALS OF IMPROVING. OF THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM AND REDUCING RELIANCE ON THE DELTA WHILE SUSTAINING WATER SUPPLIES AND THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RESERVE. GOOD MORNING I'M I'M OCEAN OBSERVE I REPRESENT FRIENDS OF STONE LAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE. A LOCAL AGENCIES OF THE NORTH DELTA IN IN THE LITIGATION THAT I'M MISTER BIJAN MENTIONED ABOUT THE SEQUEL REVIEW. AND MY REPRESENT FOR THE FIVE DELTA COUNTIES AS WELL. I'M AND. YOU KNOW I WANT TO JUST ADD ON AND NOT REPEAT TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT IN GENERAL THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE JUDGED IN IT IS A MEGA PROJECT BECAUSE THE COST IS IN THE BILLIONS. AND IT SHOULD BE JUDGED ON THE MERITS OF WHAT IT CAN DELIVER IN COMPARISON TO OTHER OPTIONS NOT EMOTIONAL SCARE TACTICS ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS BEFORE THAT CONSERVATION AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES IF FOR FULLY. DEVELOPED CAN DELIVER THE WATER THAT THE STATE NEEDS. NOW. WITH RESPECT TO THE MOUNTAIN OF ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS I JUST WANT TO STRESS THIS IS NOT A BENIGN PROJECT I'VE HEARD THAT TERM USED A LOT. AN IT IS NOT BENIGN AND I THINK SUPERVISOR NATOLI HAS MADE THAT CLEAR. AND EVEN IF THE NUMBER OF ACRES OF WETLANDS FILL GOES DOWN TO A FEW HUNDRED RATHER THAN SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED THAT'S STILL THE LARGEST FILL OF WETLANDS THAT WE'VE HEARD OF IN THE STATE. I'M THERE'S ALSO MASSIVE ENERGY DEMANDS. I HAD A HANDOUT ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WENT OUT. HOW PERFECT OKAY SO THAT SHOWS HOW IT LAYS DOWN ON THE STONE MAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE HOW IT SQUEEZING OTHER REFUGE IN BETWEEN THE EXPANDING OUT GROVE AND THE DELTA WHICH IS? LARGELY PROTECTED AREA I'M FOR BIRDS. SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE. STANHOPE CRANES WHICH WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF OUT ON THE SECOND PAGE I AM AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FISH IN THE NORTH DELTA AND SOMETIMES YOU MAY HEAR. IT SPOKEN OF AS THOUGH ITS AVOIDING FISH BY HAVING THESE MASSIVE DIVERSIONS WHICH HAVE GOT A PICTURE OF A MOCK UP THERE FROM THE ER. THAT THAT THERE WILL BE AWAY FROM FISH THERE MAY BE FEWER SMELT IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER FISH AND LIKE MR OBG MENTIONED. AS SEVERAL SPECIES OF PROTECTED FISH ARE GOING TO BE LIKELY TO ADVERSELY BE AFFECTED. AND THEN IN ADDITION OURS FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON IS IS VERY THREATENED BY THIS AND AND I THINK AND PETROLEUM CERTAIN ITALY MENTIONED BY A NEEDS TO BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE BETTER WATER QUALITY THAT YOU HEAR. THE WATER CONTRACTORS IN GW ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR EXPORTS COMES AT A SPECIFIC COST TO THE WATER QUALITY FOR THE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN THE IN OUR AREA. IN A LOT OF THOSE AND I'VE GOT A LITTLE CHART. OUR LIVE ON PAGE THREE. THAT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS IT WITH THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN REALLY LOOKED AT CAREFULLY WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WATER SUPPLIES FOR STOCKTON FOR INSTANCE. I'M. SO. IN IN THERE'S NO PLAN ALSO YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE IDEA OF DIVERTING AT HIGH FLOWS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE THIRD PAGE. ACTUALLY JUNE TO NOVEMBER PERIOD IN A BELOW NORMAL YEAR AND SO ACCORDING TO THE PETITION BEING PRESENTED AT THE WATER BOARD THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO OPERATIONAL PLAN THAT SAYS WE ONLY DIVERT DURING HIGH FLOWS AND SO THIS IS VERY CONCERNING WITH RESPECT TO THE FISH WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER WATER USERS IN THE AREA. AND THEN ALSO WITH RESPECT TO HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS WHICH IS AN INCREASING CONCERN AS. TEMPERATURES WARM I WARM AND AND AND THOSE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES THAT ARE IMPACTED ARE OFTEN WILL THOSE LEAST ABLE TO PAY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS STOCKTON IN ANTIOCH IN PARTICULAR. I'M AND I'VE HEARD THE GROUNDWATER MENTIONED AS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN PART OF THE WATER BOARD PROCEEDING WE'VE SHOWN THAT GROUND WATER LEVELS IN THE VICINITY. IN SACRAMENTO IN THE EAST AMERICAN SUBBASIN SOUTH AMERICAN SUBBASIN AS WELL AS THE SAN JOAQUIN SUBBASIN ARE IMPACTED BY THE DIVERSIONS OF WATER BECAUSE. SO MUCH WATER WOULD BE TAKEN OUT THAT THE WATER LEVEL IN THE RIVER LITERALLY GOES DOWN. SO. I AM. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ALSO THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR INSTANCE FOR THE TUNNELS FROM PETER MORE OIL BUT BUT THE BUT THE U. SIDEBOARDS HE PUT AROUND THAT NEVER REALLY GET DISCUSSED. THE SCREENING TECHNOLOGY. IS IS VERY. IS NOT DEVELOPED. ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT IS RELIED UPON FOR THE FUTURE WHICH WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE MANAGED THERE'S A HUGE RANGE OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND THE CONTRACTORS AND YOU HAVE YOU ARE. ARE JUST SAYING WE'LL TAKE CARE ABOUT DON'T WORRY. SO AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO DUE DILIGENCE ON CARRYING OUT THE RESTORATION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP FISH EVEN BACK FROM THE TEN YEARS OLD BIOLOGICAL OPINION SO THERE'S JUST NOT A GOOD TRACK RECORD HERE. FOR DOING THE THINGS THAT THAT THESE FOLKS SAY THEY WILL DO SO WE'VE GOT SEVERE RATE PAYER RISKING TAXPAYER RISK GOING ON WE'VE GOT FUNDS DIVERTED FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE WATER. AND THEN WE'VE GOT IT BECAUSE OF THE SUM COST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED EVEN MORE PRESSURE TO DIVERT WATER FROM THE DELTA THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. SO S. SUPERVISOR NATOLI MENTIONED WE NEED TO WORK ON THE LEVEES THERE AS THEY. DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION HAS ESTIMATED THAT THAT'S A ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT PROBABLY. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE EXISTING PUMPS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED. BY THE A BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS IN THAT PETER MOYAL IN HIS WHITE PAPER ALSO SAYS SHOULD BE DONE. AND AM THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES OF POSSIBLE OTHER DIVERSIONS MAYBE IN THE WEST OUT OF FOR HIGH FLOWS WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THOSE ALL THE MONEY'S BEEN SPENT ON THIS ONE PARTICULAR OPTION. OR THE SUITE OF OPTIONS AROUND IT SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO AND AND I WOULD ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES EXERCISE CONTINUING OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROCESS YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO GET THIS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND TO GET US TOWARD THE KIND OF SOLUTIONS. THAT WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT AND THIS IS THAT THE VISIT PROJECT PROP PROJECT THAT WILL JUST DIVIDE CALIFORNIA. AND THERE IS THE STATE WATER CONTRACTOR AMENDMENT PROSPECTS THAT'S UNDER WAY NOW AND THAT DOES REQUIRE A LOOK AT HEARING HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE. TO INFORM REGARDING. THE AMENDMENTS AND IN ADDITION A WATER COULD SECTION ONE FORTY SEVEN REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING TO THIS BODY. REGARDING THE BUDGET OF THE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND THAT ANNUAL REPORTING SHOULD BE REQUIRED AS PART OF ANY. HEARING THAT IS HELD IN OVERSIGHT. SO BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH ORVILLE CRISIS AND THE FED SAYING THEY MAY NOT PAY BECAUSE THE STATE WATER PROJECT FAILED TO MAINTAIN. AS THEY SHOULD HAVE THEY REALLY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT NOT LESS SO ALONG III ARE A LONG PROCESS AND A LONG LIST OF MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE LARGELY UNENFORCEABLE. DOES NOT MAKE THIS A GOOD PROJECT AND. I THINK YOU'VE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF AT EVERY LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE LOCALS ALL THE WAY UP TO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND OTHERS WHO ARE FISCALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS. ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. WE SHOULD PURSUE OTHER OPTIONS PLEASE HELP US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. DAHLE ALL PANEL TO. THIS WOULD OPEN UP BUT JUST MISTER CUDDLING HER BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE MAIN RISKS. TO MW DIS DECISION TO COVER MORE THE PROJECT AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS. SO ARE AMONG THE RISKS IN ANY LARGE PROJECT TO COURSES PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONSTRUCTION DELIVERY THERE'S ALWAYS ISSUES PROTECT IT WHEN YOU GET INTO TUNNELING WHEN YOU GET INTO THE GROUND. A METROPOLITAN HAS A GOOD TRACK RECORD AYE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WE COMPLETED BUILDING A TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR RESERVOIR THE LARGEST RESERVOIR BUILT IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY. WE DID ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. WE ALSO THEN CONNECTED IT WITH THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR TUNNEL PROJECT. IT WAS NOT ON TIME IT RAN INTO THE PLACE WE RAN NTO A VERY DIFFICULT. GROUND BUT WE ALSO DELIVERED IT ON BUDGET. AND SO WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT ON BUDGET. COUPLE YEARS TO LIFE. WE'VE ALSO A DONE OVER A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR RETROFIT OF ALL THE TREATMENT FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOVING IT TO OZONE TREATMENT WE'VE DONE THAT ON BUDGET AS WELL. SO WE KNOW HOW TO MANAGE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. THAT WE THINK IS THE STRENGTH OF THIS JPA APPROACH WE'RE BRINGING IN EXPERTISE OF AGENCIES LIKE MINE THAT BUILD LARGE PROJECTS AND PUT THEM AND TO MARRY WITH THE W. OURS AUTHORITY. AND TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DELIVER THIS ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. IT JUST SEEMS OVER YOU IF YOU'VE DOUBLED THAT THE AMOUNT YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY. YOU HAVE TO MITIGATE THAT IN SOME KIND OF WAY. WELL RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALREADY TALKING TO AGENCIES THAT WOULD BE OF MOVING WATER THROUGH THAT CAPACITY SO WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO. A MOVE WATER THROUGH THAT CAPACITY AND THEN BRENT THAT OUT OR WE'LL WATER IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE COULD MOVE THAT. YOU'VE SECOND PASS CITY AND A CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD WE EXPECT THERE'S GOING TO BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OF SANTA CLARA BY THEIR ACTION THE OTHER DAY. PUT TOGETHER AN OPTION THAT THEIR BOARD OF AUTHORIZED TO GO UP EFFECTIVELY PURCHASED TWO HUNDRED CUBIC FEET PER SECOND OF THAT THREE THOUSAND THAT WE WOULD BE FINANCING. AND WE EXPECT THE REST OF CENTRAL VALLEY AND OTHER PARTNERS TO DO THAT AS WELL. IT WAS ALWAYS EARLIER YOU BANK IT THEY BUY IT UPSET THE CONCEPT. BANK IT A WINK WHAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOT ACTUALLY BE MOVING WATER SOUTH BECAUSE IT'S THEIR WATER THEY WOULD BE CONTRACTING WITH US FOR US TO MOVE IT FOR THEM. ACT. CAN YOU TALK WITH THE GPAS AND HOW DO YOU SEE. THE PUBLIC HAVING INPUT INTO AND AND THIS BODY HAVING INPUT AND OVERSEEING US. ABSOLUTELY I THESE JP IS WOULD BE PUBLIC BODIES JP'S ARE PRETTY COMMON IN DELIVERING LARGE SCALE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THE GOLD LINE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOST OF OUR LIGHT RAIL PROJECTS HAVE HAD STANDALONE JP HAS THAT HAVE A. GOOD OVERSEEING THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THEM THEY ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES THEY MEET THEY ARE MADE UP A PUBLIC AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES THING IS SUBJECT TO THE BROWN ACT OF THE U. CAMP PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC WEBSITE OLDER SPENDING AGENDAS EVERYTHING WOULD BE POSTED AND AVAILABLE AND THE COURSE OF THIS LEGISLATURE AS ANY PUBLIC AGENCIES FORM COULD ALWAYS I HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND AND REVIEW THE PROCESS. I'M. WE'RE GOING WE TALK ABOUT THE. DELTA DEDUCTIBLES OF MAINTAIN THE DELTA WATER CONVEYANCE I'M. DOES THIS PLACE CAN YOU. WATCH IT WITH THIS PROJECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AND I AND I HAVE SAID THIS MULTIPLE TIMES WERE JUST FOCUSING ON ONE PROJECT WITHOUT LOOKING AT WESTERN INTAKES WITHOUT LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ALTERNATE WITHOUT LOOKING AT STRENGTHENING OUR LEVEES WITHOUT. LOOKING AT ANYTHING ELSE SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY NOT GOING TOWARDS A LOT OF TENSION NOT GOING TOWARDS IT THREE CO EQUAL GOALS. I MEAN HOW DO YOU I'M JUST VERY SPECIFICALLY OR OR GENERALLY HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE CO EQUAL GOALS. BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS PROJECT. IF YOU DO IT ALL. YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT START AM. I MEAN I THINK. WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY WE DON'T THINK IT MAKES THE SUPPLIES MORE RELIABLE I'M FOR ANYONE. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS PROJECT CAN EVEN BE BUILT ON TIME IT'S A MEGA PROJECT AND WE'RE AT TEN PERCENT DESIGNED SUPPOSEDLY THERE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A WATER RIGHTS HEARING AND THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY CHANGED SO MANY TIMES THAT WE ARE APPARENTLY DELAYED IN. AYE PREPARING REBUTTAL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS RIGHT NOW. SO IF THERE ISN'T A LOT OF CERTAINTY AROUND THE PROJECT AT ALL AND. SO IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY WE THINK THAT THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT AGENCIES CAN AND DO. UP PUT ATTENTION ON SHOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF RESOURCES PUT BEHIND THAT AND THAT COULD SUPPLY. LEVEL RELIABILITY. AND IN TERMS OF RESTORATION WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. MORE NATURAL FLOW PATTERNS I WAS PLEASE DIRECTOR NEMETH IS A LIMITED HER REMARKS TO THE SOUTH DELTA WHICH MAY BE TRUE BUT IN THE NORTH DELTA. IT THIS IS GOING TO LITERALLY RUN THE RIVER BACKWARDS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN EAST BAY MAD AND OTHERS WITH OTHER LARGE INTAKES IN THE AREA THAT AREN'T NEARLY AS LARGE BUT THERE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THAT. AND THEN IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS NEGOTIATED TO BE THE THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL. THE DELTA AS A PLACE. IT IT JUST GETS TRASHED I MEAN. AND AND A JPA I MEAN SANTA CLARA VOTED YESTERDAY TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDEFINED THAT WOULD APPARENTLY PROVIDE SOME OVERSIGHT IN ADDITION TO. THE ALREADY EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES THAT YOU HEARD MISS PEER AND OTHERS HAVE REFERRED TO BUT I MEAN THERE'S NO MEAT TO ANY OF THIS IN ON THE WATER QUALITY SIDE FOR IN DELTA. MOST OF THE MITIGATION SAYS THEY WILL WORK WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ADDRESS. THE WATER QUALITY THEY DON'T COMMIT TO PROVIDING REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES OR BROUGHT PROVIDING THE INCREASED COST OF TREATMENT FOR BROMIDE AND. SALT SALT SO WE JUST DON'T SEE IT. AND WHO DO YOU THINK HAS THE POWER TO CONTROL THE FLOWS AND WITH THEM DIABETES. DECISION I MEAN. AND SO AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF. YOU'RE GONNA PAY A LOT MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO. COMMIT TO PROVIDE MORE WATER YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT SOLID OR WHATEVER BUT. THERE IS UP THERE IS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO NOT DO THAT KIND OF. RECYCLING RECLAMATION AND AND OTHER THINGS IF WE ARE. FULLY INVESTED IN IT IN THIS THEN THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF WAY TO EVEN IT OUT FOR FOR REPAIRS. YEAH AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH PRESSURE GETS PUT ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO EXPORT. WHEN WARREN DROUGHT LOOK AT THE WORD A BILL THAT YOU KNOW CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF SPECIES SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ALREADY. AND I THINK IF THERE'S BILLIONS MORE INVESTED. AND BON PAIRS BEHIND NOT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN MAKE MONEY ON THEIR INVESTMENT. THEN YOU KNOW IT REALLY GIVES US CONCERNED ABOUT WATER BECOMING MORE OF A PRIVATIZED ASSET WHERE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE EVEN FARTHER DOWN THE FOOD CHAIN. M. THANK YOU AND AND THE. SUPERVISOR NATOLI WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A AND RESIDENTS MOST SERIOUS CONCERNS. I THINK I'M THE LONG TERM DEGRADATION TO THE DELTA A AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS AND I WILL BE REPETITIVE BUT. ALL YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SETTLED THE SAME TIME THE STATE WAS SETTLED AND. OF FOLKS HAVE A A MAJOR. LIVELIHOODS AND LIVES IN THE DELTA COMMUNITIES AND SOME OF THOSE HAVE GROWN AND PROSPERED ALONG WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WATER RISK IS KEYED ALL THAT'S AN ACUTE OTHER REGIONS THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE SONY THE CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS A BUILD ME COMPRISES TEMPORAL BUT IN MY VIEW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS IS NOT TEMPORARY THAT NET POINT TIME YOU CAN HAVE. SMALL BUSINESSES COLLAPSE COULD HAVE DISRUPTION TO THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES RELEASED A FARMING INTO ALL THE RELATED. ACTIVITIES GO WITH THAT. I THINK WE RUN THE RISK ALONG WITH OTHER. YEAH UNIX A COME DOWN RELATIVE TO. FLOOD ELEVATIONS INTO LEGISLATION COMES THROUGH AS RELATES TO. LEVY PROTECTIONS ITSELF FOR THAT YOU YOU OF FREEZE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND TIME AND ALL THAT YOU CAN CREATE GHOST TOWNS I THINK FOLKS ARE VERY CONCERNED THE RECREATIONAL DUST OF DISRUPTION. ONE THE WATERWAYS. IN IN IN IN IN IN IN CAN VERY FRANKLY. JOAN EGGMAN. I THINK THAT. IS OFTEN OVERSTATED IS TO OF THE FRAGILITY OF THE DELTA THAT YOU KNOW SOMEHOW IF THE. YOU KNOW. FLOODS IN IT AND SEE LEVEL RISE DON'T GET YOU EARTHQUAKES WELL THERE IS A RISK IS A RISK IN EVERYTHING WE DO AND I THINK FOLKS IN THE DELTA OF A RESILIENT THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY. THEIR LARGER BROADER COMMITTEES IN THEIR COUNTIES IT CERTAINLY IS AS A REASON THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE THE CONVEYANCES. IMPORTANT AND THAT YOU KNOW WE BENEFITTED DEGREE THAT HILL VIA IN DELTA SUPPLY ARE RECIPIENTS OF A FRESH WATER SUPPLIES IT MOVE THROUGH THE THING THAT INVESTMENT OUGHT TO BE AND THAT LEVY SYSTEM. TO UP DO THAT REYES WERE MENTIONED SOME THE OTHER TESTIMONY HERE TODAY BUT I THINK THE LONG TERM I THINK THERE'S A GREAT FEAR AND CRITICALLY COMMUNITIES I COULDN'T CORTLAND THAT ARE SMALL BEGIN WITH THAT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT A LONG THAT YOU KNOW I SAID EVERLASTING AFFECT IT WILL CHANGE THE FACE OF THE DELTA NOT JUST THE AESTHETIC. BUT I THINK THE THE THE THE THE LIFE AS WE KNOW IT IT AFFECTED VARMINT WILL AFFECT AGRICULTURE AFFECT RECREATION. TO ME THAT IS A THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS TERRIBLE LOSS I THINK IS A FEW WASN'T PURSUED WHISPERS THEY HAVE THINKER SO I MEAN TO BASICALLY THIS IS GROUP DOES NOT MYTHICAL RECALLS. YEAH AND ARGUE IT DOES NOT I THINK THAT YEAH AS YOU STATED EARLIER THE CRITICAL GOALS THAT IN AN EMPTY A VERY IMPORTANT QUALIFIER IS A LAW THAT YOU PROTECT. AND PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE DELTA AS INVOLVING PLACE BUT WITH A QUICK AGRICULTURAL ON HISTORICAL RECREATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES. I THINK YOU KNOW MISS IS THAT MARK. TERRIBLY. MISTER BUDGET M. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE GPAS AT THE FINANCING CONSTRUCTION OF THAT. I THINK THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THE GPAS ARE AWAY TO SHIFT LIABILITY AND TO A. REDUCE OVERSIGHT FROM THE ELECTED BODIES OF WATER DISTRICTS TO AN UNELECTED JPA. AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTAIN BY THE STATE WATER PROJECT OF THEIR ABILITIES TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN IT PROPERLY AND TO OPERATE PROPERLY. IN ADDITION THERE IS A AGREEMENT ON ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT FOR THE WATER FIX THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PRIVILEGE THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. BEING IN THE ROOM WITH THE FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES DID OF YOU ARE IN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND NO PUBLIC INTEREST NO INTEREST AT THE DELTA. AND SO WERE ONCE AGAIN SEEING WHAT ALMOST APPEARS TO BE A PAY TO PLAY OPPORTUNITY WHERE. THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING THE PROJECT GET TO HAVE GREATER CONTROL NOT JUST OVER THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT BUT THE ITS OPERATIONS. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY I I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS PROJECT REALLY FAILS A CO EQUAL GOALS. IT IT REALLY DOES NOT A RESTORE THE HEALTH OF THE ESTUARY IT'S GONNA HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS BOTH DURING CONSTRUCTION AND IN THE LONG TERM FOR COMMUNITIES IN THE DELTA. AND IT DOESN'T REALLY IMPROVE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S THAT REALLY HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED IS THAT. THE STATE WATER PROJECTS AT LEAST THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN INFORMING THEM MEMBER AGENCIES THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY FOR THE PROJECT OR TO TRANSFER SOME OF THEIR WATER AWAY TO ANOTHER CONTRACTOR WHO'S WILLING TO PAY. AND WHAT METROPOLITAN HAS BEEN REPORTING IS THAT THEY ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCIES AND OTHER CONTRACTORS WHERE WE WOULD SEE MET PAY MORE. AN ACT COMMUNITIES GET LESS WATER AND ULTIMATELY THAT SEEMS REALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE TO IMPROVING THE RELIABILITY OF WATER SUPPLIES PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE INTEREST FROM SAN DIEGO AND LA TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA. THINK YOU'RE MUCH. MISTER BRAZIER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MR RIGHT WING. SO. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE. POLL ALL ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT. BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET NECESSARY. PERMITS IF. THE DETERMINATION ON LAWSUITS GOING ON. FOR ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES ARE GONNA BE SUING THIS PROJECT. THAT TIME FRAME AND THE CONSTRUCTION TIME THAT YOU ANTICIPATE. WHEN YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE ONE DROP OF WATER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALL PROJECTS TAKE TIME PROTECT WATER PROJECTS I MEAN IF WE TOOK THE ANALYSIS THAT IT PROJECT MIGHT TAKE A DECADE TO DO WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BUILT ANYTHING MUCH ABOUT WOULD NEVER BUILT THE COLORADO RIVER AQUEDUCT IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. WE WOULD NOT PARTNERED WITH GOVERNOR PAT BROWN TO BUILD THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THIS PROJECT AS LINK THINK. IT'S TWELVE IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT A TWELVE YEAR CYCLE TO GET THIS ONLINE AND UP AND RUNNING. PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE LONER VENDOR STANDARDS CAN BE LITIGATION THERE HIT PRETTY HARD TO BUILD ANYTHING IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT MAJOR LITIGATION THESE DAYS. THIS IS THE PLACE WE LIVE AND WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM IF WE JUST SIT HERE AND STATUS QUO INSIDE WE CAN'T BUILD ANYTHING AT THIS TO DIFFICULT. ARE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE SUSPECT. APPRECIATE THAT AND. I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF DOCTOR JEFFREY MICHAEL FROM YOUR P. YES SIR COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR AGENCY REFUTE. HIS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE YOUR OWN THAT SHOWS. HERB SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO WE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH DOCTORS HUNTINGTON ANALYSIS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOCTOR MICHAELS DID ONE I'M WORKING WITH RESTORE THE DEALT ANOTHER GROUPS AND. WE ALSO USED TO ANNOY ECONOMIST AT BEACON ECONOMICS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOCTOR THORNBERG AND WE ALSO DID OUR OWN IN HOUSE ANALYSIS. SO MISTER MICHAELS FOUND IT DID NOT PASS THE BENEFITS TEST LE DOCTOR SOUNDING DR THORNBERG AND OUR OWN STAFF FILLED THE DEAD. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT OUR BOARD LOOKED AT THOSE STUDIES AND DECIDED THAT THIS DID MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE FOR METROPOLITAN. LOOK AT. BASED ON OUR PAST EXPERIENCES WITH THE. ORVILLE DAM AND. WATER CONTRACTORS OF. BEEN REMISS ON MAINTENANCE I WOULD I GUESS WHO'S BEEN THE CONCLUSION. WHAT IF THIS PROJECT DESTROYS THE DELTA? WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT IS METROPOLITANS COMMANDMENT? THAT AFTER THIS PROJECT IF IT WAS PUT IN PLACE LIKE THE OTHER PROJECT THE. NOW REVERSES THE FLOW OF THE DELTA. AND YOU KNOW TO BENEFIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS PLAN B.? IF THIS TURNS THE DELTA IN TO US. SALTON FORMER. AND THE ONLY BENEFIT THEN IS WHAT WE THOUGHT. ALL ALONG VISIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOT A GOOD ONE AND. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE SHAFT SOMEHOW IT WILL HOW DO WE KNOW. THAT BECAUSE OF PAST. EXPERIENCES NOW WITH THE DAMN REPORT WE HAD IN THE MAINTENANCE LEVELS BEING VERY VERY LOW. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE? AS A BACKSTOPS. IF THIS SCREWS UP THE DELTA. AND WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CO EQUAL GOALS METROPOLITAN WAS AN ORIGINAL SPONSOR OF THE DELTA REFORM ACT AND HELPED NEGOTIATE AND DEVELOP THAT LANGUAGE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE CO EQUAL GOALS ARE BOARD ADOPTED THEM. AND WE PARTNERED WITH AN RTC AND DEVELOPING THAT LANGUAGE AND THAT WAS A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE TOOK SERIOUSLY WE BELIEVE THOSE TWO PIECES OF IT. WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND WE'VE INVESTED MONEY IN BOTH AND WE BELIEVE BOTH HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD. ON. YOU KNOW MISTAKES MADE NINETEEN. ORVILLE WAS BUILT TO THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AT THE TIME IN NINETEEN SIXTY. AND IT FUNCTIONED WELL FOR FIFTY YEARS IT HAD A IT DID DEVELOP A CRACK AND THEN IT FELL APART. A WE HAD ISSUES WITH IT UP MAINTENANCE WAS TEN MAINTAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL THAT WAS BUT THEY WERE YOU KNOW WAS BUILT WITH NINETEEN SIXTIES TECHNOLOGY. OF WE BELIEVED AT THE TIME WHEN THEY DISCUSS THE PERIPHERAL CANAL THAT THE SMARTEST TECHNOLOGY WAS TO BUILD A VERY LARGE AND DROP OFF WATER THROUGHOUT THE DELTA TO FRESHEN IT UP. NOW TODAY WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE IT WOULD CONFUSE SALMON. WE LEARN AND WE ADAPT AS WE GO ALONG WE'RE GOING TO DUST THIS PROJECT IS THE IS THE PRODUCT OF THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE WE HAVE TODAY TO MOVE WATER IN A FISH FRIENDLY RELIABLE MANNER. PROTECTED FROM SEISMIC. WORK WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IT IS THE BEST TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY. FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW ARE WE GONNA BE SAYING I'M WHICH WE BUILT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THERE'S A CHANCE OF THAT ABSOLUTELY AND THEN WE WILL BE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY TO DO THAT. SO AND AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE. FRIGHTENING FACTS OF. WHEN AN AGENCY GETS IN SO INVESTED INTO A PROJECT AND HAS. TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO IT IN AND WE DO GO INTO A DECADE. GOD FOR BID DROUGHT. THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A TENDENCY TO. GO AFTER. INDIAN DANGERS SPECIES TO BE ABLE TO NOW MOVE THEM OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD. PEOPLE BEFORE FANA OR FISH. OKAY IS AS IT IS KIND OF AN NOMENCLATURE DOWN THERE. AND THEN AGAIN. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GONNA WHEN YOU HAVE THIS INVESTMENT IN HIS? CERTAINLY SIR I MEAN I'VE DONE. SEVERAL BILLS TO PROTECT MY DELTA. AND NONE OF THEM GOT AND I HAVE TO GIVE YOUR AGENCY IN A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS THE CREDIT. NONE OF THEM GOT OUT A COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INFLUENCE. ON THE DELTA. AND. YOU KNOW I USED TO BEYOND WATERPARKS AWHILE BUT BECAUSE OF MY STAND TO PROTECT THE DELTA. I FIRMLY BELIEVE I WAS REMOVED I AM ASKED TO GET OFF. AND SO. AGAIN. HOW DO WE HAVE ASSURANCES THAT YOU SPENDING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A PROJECT? THEY THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO AFTER THE INDIES ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND AND. DECIMATE A SPECIES TO PUT. PEOPLE BEFORE. ENVIRONMENT WELL SIR I CAN ASSURE YOU WE DIDN'T ASK THAT YOU BE TAKEN OFF THE COMMITTEE EITHER WELL BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT SO. I WASN'T TRACKING AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST ARE SO. WE WORKED. WE WHAT WE WERE COMMITTED TO THE CO EQUAL GOALS AND THAT IS BOTH ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AS WELL AS WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY OUR AGENCY HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED WE CAN WORK. WITHIN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO MAKE THIS WORK WE HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE. WE INVEST IN. FISH PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IN OUR SELF INTEREST TO HAVE THE FISH DO BETTER BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE MORE FLEXIBLY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED. OUR COLORADO RIVER SUPPLIES FIFTEEN OF THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN DRY SOME OF THE DRIEST YEARS IN OVER TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS BASED ON TREE RINGS ON THE COLORADO RIVER. IN THE LAST DECADE IN CALIFORNIA NINE OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS HAVE BEEN TRY AGAIN SOME OF THE DRIEST YEARS ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS. WE'VE GONE THROUGH UP REALLY DIFFICULT DROUGHT AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TO RESORT TO AUSTRALIA OR CAPETOWN TACTICS TO DELIVER OR WATER OR DO EMERGENCY CRASH BUILDING. MAINLY BECAUSE WE PREPARED FOR THIS AND DONE PRETTY WELL WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WE'VE RESPECTED THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WE HAVEN'T RAMROD THROUGH DO BILLS NOT WHAT METROPOLITAN HAS NOT BEEN WORKING AND CONGRESS. ARE SO THERE HAS NOT BEEN A. MAJOR GETTING OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES WE ARE GOING THROUGH AN INCREDIBLY DRY PERIOD AND. FISHER SUFFERING FARMS ARE SUFFERING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING BUT WE'RE MANAGING THROUGH IT AND WE'RE PROTECTING AND RESPECTING THOSE LAWS THAT WE HAVE. ONE MORE QUESTION PART SO YOU DO TALK ABOUT THE THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE LEVEES IN THE DELTA WELL. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY A LARGE MAJORITY THE TELCOS LEVEES ARE SUPPORTED BY RECLAMATION DISTRICTS BETTER ON THE HOOKED UP TO MAINTAIN THOSE LEVEES ON THEIR OWN IN THE. FARMERS PAY FOR IT OUT OF THEIR PROFITS AND SO WE HAD PROP ONE THE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SUPPLEMENT TO THAT I THINK WE STE. TOOK TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM MONEY INSULATED OVER INTO ONE A AS A. TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS HEAD OF THE FIVE BILLION THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE FINANCED. SO. YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T HEAR AGENCY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT FIVE ISLANDS OUT IN THE DELTA. ON THAT WERE FORM FORM COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW IN AND. HEAVILY LADEN WITH ARSENIC AND ALL OF THESE OTHER FARMING. ISSUES. AND THEN I HEARD YOU KNOW IT IT INITIALLY WAS GONNA BE FOR STORAGE AND DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN ONE ON. SOME JUST SOME OF THE STUFF THAT YOU YOU GUYS ARE CLAIMING WE DON'T HAVE IN PLACE WHERE WRITTEN RECLAMATION DISTRICTS HAVE SUBVENTION. ACT IN PLACE A. SO. I MEAN. WHEN WE FIRST SAW. THE BCP AND ITS INCEPTION WAS GOING TO BE THIS BIG CONSERVATION PLAN TO THE FIX EVERYTHING. THEN FIGURED OUT YOU COULD AFFORD IT. AND THEN SO NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT THE WATER. AND NO ONE IS GOING TO BE DONE TO THE DELTA. BUT IN CASE IN FACT I REALLY. I REALLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW. WHEN I SEE SALINITY BARRIERS GOING IN PLACE. WHEN WE HAVE LOW FLOW YEARS. I DID OF YOURS PUTTING IN PLACE. AT FALSE RIVER IN AND OLD RIVER. AND THEY WANT TO PUT HIM IN STEAMBOAT SLOUGH IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS. IF YOU CONTINUE TO DRAIN THE DELTA. HIGHER UP IN THE NORTHERN INTAKE AT CORTLAND. YOU'RE GONNA DIMINISH SHALL FLOW AND SELECT IS GONNA COME UP. AND RECREATION WILL SUFFER AND BOATING WILL SUFFER IF WE HAVE TO PUT SALUTE ANY BARRIERS BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT. THESE ARE JUST TRUE FACTS. AND. I I REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO WEIGH IN AND PUT SOME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. SOME BENCHMARKS AND SOME BASS LINES. AND SOME ACTION ITEMS. BEFORE THIS THING GETS OUT OF HAND AND AND THAT AND ESTATE AGENCIES. CREATING. WITH A. WILL MOVE WATER CONTRACTORS THEIR OWN PURPOSE. I THINK THE WE NEED THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS HEARING ALL THREE OF YOU CHAIRS. SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A VOICE AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE COLLECTIVELY. THAT WHAT WE GOAL WE'RE UP IN SACRAMENTO TO DO SOMETHING AND THAT'S TO PROTECT ALL. NOT JUST SOME. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO GO THROUGH HERE CREATE OUR OWN COST BENEFIT NOW. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WILL AND WHAT WILL NOT WORK IN OUR MINDS THAT REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE? IT HAS AS IT IS NOW RIGHT NOW. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A TRAGEDY ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY THAT IF THIS GOES FORWARD. HELLO. I HOPE. I HOPE. BUT I'M NOT HERE. WHEN THIS THING JUST ABSOLUTELY. DEVASTATES THE DELTA. I CAN ENTER. UP MISTER BINYON MISTER BLOWN HER GOOD LUCK GO WOULD GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. ACTUALLY WOULD YEAH SINGLY YEAH IT'S A AND. NO IT. APPRECIATED HEARING. MY COLLEAGUE FROM DISCOVERY BASED CONCERNS. YEAH I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT. WE DID HAVE A PANELIST BUT ON PANEL ONE FROM THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO IT. YOU KNOW PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO THE CONCERNS THAT HE SHARED. SO THAT WE DON'T WALK AWAY FROM PANEL TO IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. IN QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT. THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WOULD BE ABLE TO. HAVE ANY DIRECTION ABOUT ECOSYSTEM. IMPACTS AND AND SOUGHT MADAM JUST WAITED THEY STATED THEY DID YEAH SO YOU KNOW SO THEY SAY THAN THE WRITTEN THE FIRST PART. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT NOW GIVEN THAT THESE. ISSUES HAVE BEEN VOICED. OR NOT OR YOU'RE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE TO ST PAVE IT MARY SAY THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CONTROL THIS AUDIT. AT ARE ARE YOU ASKING FOR IT WOULDN'T COME BACK UP. WELL IF I DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL AS THOUGH THAT THEY CAN'T ANSWER TO WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO GIVEN THESE MORE DIRECTED QUESTIONS. WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO COMPANIES YOU QUESTIONS MR GREATER. THERE WERE PLEASE GET OF. SO BACK BACK UP. BUT ALREADY SHE LEFT. SHE LEFT A QUICK. I'M DIANE RIDDLED WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF WATER RATES. AND YES THE BOARD WOULD HAVE PERMITTING AUTHORITY OVER THE APPROPRIATE ALL TO FLOW CRITERION OTHERCONDITIONS ON THE PROJECT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE IMPACTS TO OTHER LEGAL USERS WATER. OR FISH AND WILDLIFE. IN ADDITION TO THE PERMITTING AUTHORITY THAT THE BOARD HAS OVER THE WATER FIX GENERALLY WE ALSO HAVE A. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT COLLUDED IN THE DELTA REFORM ACT CONCLUDED APPROPRIATE DELTA FLOW CRITERIA AND ANY APPROVAL OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT. IN ADDITION TO THE APPROVALS OF THE BOARD WOULD HAVE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO PROVE ANY WATER FIX PROJECT THAT WATER PICKED PROJECT THAT THE BOARD CAN ALSO CHOOSE NOT TO PROVE THE PROJECT IF THE EVIDENCE IN OUR HEARING RECORD. INDICATES THAT THE PROJECT CAN BE COMPLETED WITHOUT HAVING IMPACTS ON OTHER LEGAL USERS OF WATER OR AND RECENTLY IMPACTING FISHING ARE FIVE. SO ASSUMING THE BOARD. THE BOARD DID APPROVE THE WATER FIX PROJECT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE CONTINUING AUTHORITY OVER THE WATER A PERMITS AND THE CHANGES TO REVIEW AS NECESSARY. THE PROJECT OVERTIME CONTINUALLY. IN ADDITION. OTHER PARTIES WOULD ALSO HAVE AND THE ABILITY TO AYE. SUBMIT COMPLAINTS OF THEY HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROJECT SIMPLY THAT THEY WERE NOT COMPARTMENTS WITH WATER RIGHT PERMIT CONDITIONS OR IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE LAWS REGARDING PLACED AN UNREASONABLE USE AND PROTECTION OF BENEFICIAL USE THAT SO. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE BOARD RETAINS CONTINUING AUTHORITY OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND SUCH ABOUT A PROJECT WITH THEIR WITHOUT THE WATER FIX PROJECT ARM BUT. AND THERE THAT THERE ARE THE SPECIFIC ARAB ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BUILT INTO THE WATER FIX. PROCESS RELATED TO THE ADULTS REFORM ACT THAT WOULD ALSO PLAY A PART IN THE PROCESS. OKAY WITH SO. AND JUSTICE TO SIT BACK SO ALL THOSE LONG LINES OF MISTER PATTERSON STE. QUESTIONS EARLIER THAT YOU WOMEN WE MIGHT BE SPENDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE FLOW ANY POTENTIALLY. ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF WORRY THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD TWO MASSIVE FORTY FEET TUNNELS A HUNDRED FIFTY FEET BELOW THE GROUND. YOU'RE GONNA LET THE WATER FLOW TO THOSE AT THE TO KIND OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT CORRECT THE TO FIT THE TO FEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THEY WOULD SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IT'S NOT GONNA PRODUCE ONE EXTRA DROP. MBE YOU'RE GONNA SAY WE'VE BUILT THESE MASSIVE THINGS WE'VE INVESTED ALL OF THIS MONEY. FOR SURE WE NEED TO LET THAT WATER FLOW. pSO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS AND THAT. INSTRUCTION ON THE WATER FIX IT'S AN AUTHORIZED UNTIL THE BOARD ISSUES ITS DECISION ON THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION SO. I THINK BUILT INTO THAT PROCESS IS THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE IF THE BOARD WILL IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE DELTA FOKKER TERRY AND OTHER CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH. THE PROJECT WOULD BE APPROVED AND THAT WOULD INFORM THE DECISION MAKERS ON YOU KNOW WHETHER. AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THAT MAKE SENSE TO ME FOR WITH THE PROJECT. FOR THAT WOULD BE PART OF I THINK THE CALCULUS AND THE FURTHER DECISION MAKING ON THE PROCESS OF THE PROJECT. SO BE IT. YEAH I THINK YOU GET MADAM CHAIR I THINK MS RIDDLE FOR COMING UP IN AND TRIED IN SOME. CLARITY ON THE POWERS OF THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. IN LIGHT OF THOSE QUESTIONS. AND DIED IN AND JUST REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON ON MADAM SHARES COMMENTS JUST NOW I THINK THAT A LOT OF ADVOCATES. COULD SAY I THOUGHT ABOUT MORE WATER IT'S ABOUT. SO CERTAINTY THAT A BETTER SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE FOR A HEALTHIER ECOSYSTEM. AND DIE AND THEN OTHERS WOULD SAY NO NO IT'S MORE ABOUT BE WE JUST WANT WATER WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THOSE OTHER THINGS BUT. I THINK WHAT TIED MY COLLEAGUE FROM DISCOVERY BAY RAISED WHICH I THINK IS YOU KNOW THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF. WE WE BUILD SOMETHING THAT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF WHAT WE WANTED IN FACT MAKES THINGS WORSE. ON. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ONCE WE WE SPEND THAT MONEY AND PUT THE SWITCH AND REALIZE THIS IS ACTUALLY. HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ALL AROUND THAT THE. YOU KNOW ALL THE BENEFITS ADDED UP DON'T SAT ADD UP TO MORE OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AND. WHAT WITH THE RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S COURSE OF ACTION BE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT? I THINK THE DECISION REGARDING THE FUNDING ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT WHAT WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD IN ITS CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC INTERESTS OF THE PROJECT SO THAT IS. PART OF THE HEARING PROCESS AND PART OF WHAT THE BOARD WILL DISSIPATE DECIDE UPON A AND WHETHER TO APPROVE THE PROJECT OR NOT. AND I AM AS FAR AS GOING TO LET YOU DO IT IS I MEAN. SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT THE BOARD IS ASSESSING THE APPROVAL OF THE ATWATER FIX CHANGE PETITION PROJECT ON. IS WHETHER THE PROJECT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST ARE NOT SO IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT. POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OTHER LEGAL USERS OF WATER AND IMPACTS DEFICIENT WILDLIFE THE PORT IS ALSO CONSIDERING PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS. THAT'S A FAIRLY BROAD A HUNDRED SUBJECT MATTER AREA AND THE BOARD HAS A LIMITED SUBSET. OF AUTHORITIES WITHIN THAT AREA BUT THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS PART OF THE HEARING PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU AND AND THANKS MADAM CHAIR FOR FOR REALIZING THAT I AYE MAYBE MY QUESTION ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH. UP LET'S SAY LET'S BE VERY SPECIFIC THAT ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS NEVER MATERIALIZED AND IN FACT IT IS MORE HARMFUL. AND I AS WE KNOW IN IN A DROUGHT YEARS WATER DELIVERIES CAN BE. STOPPED. WOULD THAT BE RECOURSE FOR THE WATER AT THE CONTROL BOARD IN THAT INSTANCE. OR I WOULD THERE BE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE BOARD CONSIDERS. IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTMENT OR OTHER BENEFITS. GIVEN YOU KNOW WE FLIP THE SWITCH AND IN FACT MORE FISH ARE DYING AND THE SYSTEM IS IN A WORSE PLACE IT WAS PRIOR. SO ANY APPROVAL OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT WOULD INCLUDE CONDITIONS AND ONGOING AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD TO LOOK AT WHETHER THAT'S CONDITIONS ARE ADEQUATE TO AVOID AND REASONABLE IMPACTS DEFICIENT WILDLIFE AND OTHER LEGAL USERS WATER. SO IT'S PART OF THAT PROCESS THAT COULD INVOLVE LIMITATIONS ON DIVERSIONS OF WATER INTO FUTURE. CHANGES TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE PROJECT OF THEM AS APPROVED OR NOT. ALSO I THINK IN IT AND WEBER IF THE BOARD CHIEF OF SUCH TO APPROVE THE PROJECT IT WOULD INCLUDE CONDITION THAT WOULD LOOK AT. WHETHER OF THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY DOING WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO WHICH AND WOULD INVOLVE SOME SORT OF WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE SOME SORT OF. REGULAR REVIEW PROCESS ON THOSE ISSUES SO AT AGAIN. NOTHING IS A CERTAIN STONE ONCE THE BOARD AT APPROVED APPROVED THE PROJECT THE BOARD HAS THAT CONTINUED AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT. THE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PROTECTIONS. A FISH MY WIFE AND LEGAL USERS OF WATER ARE IN PLACE. IN ADDITION THE BOARD HAS AND IT'S PROCESS TO ESTABLISH WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVE SEARCH FOR THE PROTECTION OF. PITCH TAMALE BENEFICIAL USES AND OTHER BENEFICIAL USE AND EIGHT HAS A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO REVIEW THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND UPDATE THEM AS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE REASONABLE PROTECTION OF BENEFICIAL USE OF AND THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD EXTEND TO. ALL WATER USERS IN THE BASIN IN ADDITION TO THE WATER FIX AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND STATE WATER PROJECT SO. I THINK THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS IN PLACE THERE BOTH REQUIRE. THE BOARD TO LOOK AT THE REASONABLE PROTECTION BENEFICIAL USES OVERTIME ADAM AND ALLOW THE BOARD TO PROVIDE MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO DO THAT. I THINK YOU FOR FOR. SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO. THAT THE POWERS OF THE BOARD A LOT OF THE CONCERNS. THAT PEOPLE HAVE TALKING AT THE NEW TUNNELS MORE WATER THAN IT DID IN THE PAST IF THERE WERE TWO OF THE TUNNELS OR A BIGGER TITLE MECHANISM. ON ONE HAND SAYING IN HIGH WATER EVENTS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CAPTURE WHAT IS EXTRA. IT MORE THAN WHAT THE ENVIRONMENT NEEDS. AND IN LOW WATER EVENTS TRUSTING THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE. AND DIED IN SO. HOW HOW? QUICK IS THAT DECISION MAKING IN IN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE WHEN THOSE THINGS TAKE PLACE. AND A AND WHAT IS THE. KIND OF THE OF THE VERIFICATION OUR VALIDATION THAT THE TRUST BUILDING COMPONENT TO SAY THAT IN THE THE LOWER WATER EVENTS WHERE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY. TRANSFER WATER BECAUSE OF THAT THE ECOSYSTEM. THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THAT TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. AND IN BOTH INSTANCES WHAT ONCE YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE MODERN AND OTHERS TO SAY. NO NO NO THAT'S THAT'S NOT I MEAN BOTH BOTH HAVE VALID POINTS. SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAJOR MAJOR CONSIDERATIONS AND THE BOARDS ESTABLISHMENT OF APPROPRIATE DELTA FLOW CRITERIA FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROJECTS. WHICH WOULD LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND WHAT FACTOR AND YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A DECISION THE BOARD HAVE THEM MADE GETS I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY SPEAK TO. EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRING AS PART OF THAT DECISION BUT THE DELTA REFORM ACT. IT'S AN OBLIGATION ON THE BOARD TO ESTABLISH THAT AS CRITERIA IN ADDITION AS I MENTIONED THAT WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLANNING PROCESS IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS I THINK ARE. ANOTHER MECHANISM THAT REQUIRE US TO INCH ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE BENEFICIAL USES AND MORE. YOU KNOW ENGAGED IN A PROCESS TO UPDATE THE BAY DELTA PLAN NOW. TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF BENEFICIAL USES OUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE WATER FIX PROJECT. TAKE PLACE OR NOT AND I THINK THOSE FLOW OBLIGATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THAT REVIEW WILL BE APPLICABLES WHETHER THAT. WATER FIX PROJECT GOES IT GOES FORWARD OR NOT AND ADAM ARE CONTINUING OBLIGATION OF THE POURED INTO THE FUTURE AND SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE. WE'RE OBLIGATED TO LOOK AT ON A REGULAR BASIS SO I I THINK THOSE ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT YOU KNOW PROVIDE FOR. THAT THOSE ASSURANCES AND ALSO UNIT ADS EILEEN SPOKE TO. THE PORTS PROPHECIES ARE VERY PUBLIC THE BOARD THOUGH PUBLIC ALWAYS HAVE THEIR. TO COMMENT AND PUBLIC FORUMS BEFORE THE BOARD MEMBER SO. I THINK FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE EVERYTHING CONCERNS BEFORE THE BOARD THE BOARD ITS UNIQUELY AND. FISH AND TO PROVIDE FOR THAT PUBLIC IN PLAY AND HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING OUR PROJECT AND HOW IT'S BEING OPERATED. WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS THE CRITERIA GOING TO BE DEVELOPED? THE CRITERIA WOULD BE PART OF THE DECISION THAT THE PORT ISSUES ON THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION. AND ALSO CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE INCLUDED IT WOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED AND THE BOARDS. ISSUANCE OF A WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT IF THE BOARD. CHOOSES TO APPROVE THE PROJECT SO. THOSE CONDITIONS WOULD BE LAID OUT IN THE A DRAFT ORDER THAT IT'S RELEASED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THAT. THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE THAT ORDER BEFORE THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTION OF THE ORDER. ONCE THE BOARD ADOPTED THE ORDER OF THE PUBLIC IN THAT AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES WOULD ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR TIME MINOR DAY THAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN KNOW THAT. THEIR SUPPORT HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHEN THAT PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETE. A IT DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING AT GWR'S COMPLETION ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PROJECT. AYE AND THE ADDITION OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE HEARING PROCESS THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF A HEARING PROCESS RIGHT NOW. WHERE I AM WE'VE COMPLETED THE FIRST PART OF THE HEARING WHICH FOCUSES ON OTHER WE WILL USERS OF WATER WE MAY NEED TO REVISIT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES? IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REALIGNMENT THAT YOU GET YOUR IS CONTEMPLATING. WERE PART WAY THROUGH PART TWO OF THE HEARING WHICH IS FOCUSED ON FISH AND WILDLIFE ADMIN APPROPRIATE DELTA FLOW CRITERIA. SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE PRODUCT THE HEARING PROCESS THAT STE STILL TAKING PLACE MONTHLY HARRY RECORD. CLOSES THEN THE BOARD NEEDS TO TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IT HURT DURING THE HEARING PROCESS ASSESSMENT INFORMATION. AND DEVELOP A DRAFT ORDER SO THAT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO. TO COMPLETE THAT PROCESS REALLY DEPEND. ON THE VOLUME AND COMPLEXITY OF INFORMATION THAT'S IN THE HEARING RECORD OF WHICH IF IT'S FAIRLY COMPLEX AND SLIMNESS SO I THINK SO LIKE IN THIS DECADE HER. NEXT DECADE. BUT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY I THINK THE BOARD IF IT IS DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO EXPEDITIOUSLY WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS PROPHET WHETHER IT'S PROJECTS GOING TO BE APPROVED OR NOT AND IF IT'S APPROVED UNDER WHAT. CONDITIONS SO I CAN'T COMMIT TO YOUR SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME BUT IT IS. CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO AN EXPEDITIOUS PROPHETS FOR THOSE REASONS. THE MISTER WILL. THANK GOODNESS EGGMAN. I HAVE TO RUN SO. RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS I'M JUST GONNA AT A COUPLE OF THOUGHT OF OF COMMENTS AND TO. AND MAY BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN TIME FOR THE END OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. I WHICH I REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING. OF. I THINK ONE THING THAT THAT'S BECOME AMPLY CLEAR AS RESULT OF THIS HEARING. AND AND THAT I ALLUDED TO IN MY OPENING COMMENTS IS THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE I THINK REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE. PROVIDING REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT TO OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M EXPAND A. OF AND IT'S BEEN A PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE LACK OF THE UP AND UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND I SAY THAT NOT ONLY IS THE CHAIR OF BUDGETS UP THREE WHERE. OF THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE WOULD TRADITIONALLY LIVE BUT ALSO ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SANTA MONICA AND OTHER PARTS OF FOR. THE JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT THAT THAT I REPRESENT I WOULD TO A POINT OUT THAT THE. OF THE THE THE VOTE ATTA AT THE MET WAS FAR FROM UNANIMOUS. AT A IN FACT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. A WAS SIR. FULLY OPPOSED TO THE. TO THE RECENT VOTE TO APPROVE IN THE FINANCING BECAUSE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE. A OF OF THE PROGRAM I WAS STRUCK BY. A A COMMENT. A DURING THE TESTIMONY THAT. SEEM TO ME TO SET OUT SORT OF A ZERO SUM GAME WE EITHER APPROVE THE TWIN TUNNELS. OR. FOR MATT ANYWAY WE HAVE TO HAVE A FIND A WAY TO REPLACE THE ENTIRETY OF THE THIRTY PERCENT THAT A IS CURRENTLY. A A A A A COMING FROM. FROM THIS AREA. AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE CASE THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS. I'M NOT AT A POINT RIGHT NOW WHERE I CAN SAY THAT THOSE OTHER OPTIONS HAVE BEEN. ADEQUATELY. LOOKED AT AND WHETHER OR NOT SOME MIX OF. THE STATUS QUO RECYCLING STORM WATER DIVERSION. IS THE THE PROPER SOLUTION I'M INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT IS I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE THAT DIRECTION. ANYWAY. I DO HAVE TO SAY THIS BUT A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT. A HOW MUCH. OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD COST AND HOW MUCH UNCERTAINTY THERE IS. AND IF WE'RE GONNA MOVE AS IT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD IN THE DIRECTION OF RECYCLING AND STORM WATER DIVERSION ANOTHER. FORWARD THINKING WAYS OF OF DEALING WITH OUR WATER ISSUES. OF IT'S GOING TO COST US A LOT OF MONEY SO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SPEND MONEY ON THIS ISSUE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THAT WILL COME OF IT BUT TO IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE. AND WITH THAT. THANK YOU FOR DURING THE MEETING KENTA LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE FIGURE VETERANS FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST ONE QUESTION OF. BUT THE WATER CONTROL RESOURCE BOARD WHO POINTS THE ABOARD. BUT GOVERNOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY ó THANK YOU TO THIS PANEL AND.

THE STATE WATER PROJECT THROUGH THE DELTA. IT IS IMPORTANT AS A BASE OF SUPPLY ON WHICH ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES CAN THEN TAKE PLACE. WE ALSO KNOW BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE DONE BUT ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES OR BETWEEN TWO AND FIFTEEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WITHOUT THE BASE WE'VE AND REALLY START JACKING RATES ON SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS.

ALL OF IT BUT EVEN WHEN WE DO. WILL REMAIN DEPENDENT ON THE STATE PROJECT FOR THREE FOURTHS OF OUR SUPPLIES LAST WEEK THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIES HAS SURPASSED THE UNITED KINGDOM BECOME THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST. BUT IT COULD BE WIPED OUT INSTANTLY. AN EARTHQUAKE IN A DELICATE DELTA COULD RUPTURE LEVEES TURN THE DELTA INTO AN INLAND SEA. AND CUT OFF THE PRIMARY SUPPLY FOR SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. THE ECONOMIC DOES DEVASTATION WOULD LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO RESTORE THE SUPPLY WE URGE YOU TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND JOBS OF OUR RESIDENTS. AND SUPPORT WATER FIX THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT STONE I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR SANTA CLARITA VALLEY WATER AGENCY I THINK THE NEWEST WATER AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA WE REFORM FROM FOR. PRIOR AGENCIES WITH THE IDEA OF WATERSHED MANAGEMENT THE SENATE CREATIVE VALLEY. THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS A KEY PART OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER RELIABILITY PLANNING HOWEVER IS NOT THE SOLE SOURCE WE HAVE LOCAL GROUNDWATER. RECYCLE WATER THAT WE ARE PURSUING TO DEVELOP WHICH IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PERMIT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS GROUNDWATER CONJUNCTIVE USE WATER BANKING AND WE REALLY ARE TAKING APPROACH IS A NEW AGENCY OF WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE ENTIRE SENATE THREE TWO RIVER WATERSHED? WHICH EXTENDS DOWN INTO VENTURA COUNTY IN AREAS OF OVERDRAFT I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THIS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE SOLUTION BUT NOT THE SOLE SOLUTION AND YOU'LL SEE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ALL AREAS AND WITHOUT IT WOULD INDICATE. OUR BOARD TOOK A POLICY SUPPORT POSITION LAST FALL AMPLE THANK YOU LIKELY PARTICIPATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KIMBERLY* I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE MOB THE WATER AGENCY LOCATED IN THE HIGH DESERT WE COVER FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES PRIMARILY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMISSION THAT THE. THIS ALTERNATE CONVEYANCE STRUCTURE WAS ENVISIONED IN ON NINETEEN SIXTY. AT THAT TIME IT WAS PART OF THE BURNS PORTER ACT AND WAS LISTED ON THE BALLOT AS A PROPOSITION ONE THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT BOND ACT. IT WAS AT THAT TIME SEEN AS A COMPLETION OF THE ENTIRE STATE WATER PROJECT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMISSION. THAT WE CONCUR WITH THE SENTIMENTS BACK THEN THOSE THAT SAW THE NEED FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONVEYANCE STRUCTURE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE TWIN TUNNELS. THANK YOU IT RICH AND LATER THE VOTERS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IT DOWN BUT THINK. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THAT ALLOW SO ON BEHALF OF THE INLAND EMPIRE UTILITIES AGENCY UP WE TO WANT TO SHARE THAT THE AGENCY. AS A A LARGE PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO A LOCAL WATERSHED MANAGEMENT. LOTS OF INVESTMENT RECYCLED WATER AND CONSERVATION AND AND CREATIVE WAYS TO. REUSE LOCAL SUPPLIES. PART OF THE PORTFOLIO PLUG APPROACH THAT IS NECESSARY AND WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH. HELLO. LAST BUT NOT LEAST I HOPE. MY NAME IS BARBARA DAILY I LIVE IN THE DELTA I LIVE IN THE CONSTRUCTION ZONE WHERE THE TUNNELS ARE PLANNED TO BE. BUILT AND WHERE THE INTAKES ARE PLANNED TO BE BUILT AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THE PROJECT WILL DEVASTATE THE DELTA REGION ITS AGRICULTURE ITS HISTORY ITS RECREATION ITS ECOSYSTEM. PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BREATHE THE AIR WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL THE ROADS. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DRINK THE WATER IF THIS IS TO SUPPLY A WATER SUPPLY FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS IT'S TAKING AWAY OUR WATER SUPPLY IT WILL BE TAINTED. THE CONSTRUCTION WILL A DESTROYER WELLS THERE IS A LITTLE TOWN THERE CALLED LOCK IT'S A LEGACY COMMUNITY IT'S ON THE NATIONAL HISTORIC REGISTER. IT WILL FALL BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION THE VIBRATION THE NOISE AT SAUDARA. AND ALSO WE RECENTLY LEARNED THROUGH I HAVE BEEN ATTENDING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HEARINGS AND I'VE HEARD. THAT. THERE ARE MANY GAS WELLS OUT IN THE DELTA THE IN THE LINE OF THE CONSTRUCTION THAT COULD. BE AFFECTED BY THIS WE HAVE FIREMEN OUR FATHERS AND OUR BROTHERS. MIGHT HAVE TO GO INTO THAT I DO HAVE A HANDOUT IF I MAY TO GIVE YOU THAT GIVES THE SERGEANTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON PALM A SPECIFIC FOREST TRUST I JUST REALLY STRUCK DURING THE TESTIMONY OR DURING THE DISCUSSION EARLIER. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MENTIONED IN OUR TALK ABOUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE THERE'S NO NEW WATER WE'RE JUST INCREASING THE RELIABILITY OF MOVING WATER THAT SCENE ALL KIND OF OUR CURRENT. AMOUNT IT SEEMS CRAZY TALKING ABOUT MAKING THESE LEVELS OF INVESTMENTS WITHOUT ALSO. DOING MORE CONCERTED RESTORATION WORK IN OUR UPPER WATERSHEDS TO TRY AND GET BACK INTO MORE RESILIENT CONDITION OR WERE LESS SUBJECT TO LARGE FIRES LURE OTHER. EVENTS THE CAN DEGRADE WATER QUALITY BUT ALSO QUITE LIKELY COMPREHENSIVE RESTORATION THERE COULD LEAD TO MORE WATER AVAILABILITY. SO AND CERTAINLY COULD EXTEND THE TIMING OF WATER LATER INTO THE YEAR SO AS WATER IS FLOWING OUT INTO. JUNE JULY RATHER THAN ENDING IN MAY THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF MORE WATER AVAILABILITY SO. I REALLY ENCOURAGE US TO NOT LOSE TRACK OF THE FACT THE WATER ACTUALLY COMES FROM SOMEWHERE AND WE'D MAKE INVESTMENTS THERE AS WELL. I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COM. MORE ON THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS IN OUR HEARINGS NAM. AND JUST IN CLOSE OVER THANK EVERYBODY VERY MUCH FOR FOR COMING FORWARD. AGAIN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK ALL OF CALIFORNIA IS INVESTED IN. IT AT AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY EVEN I MEAN FURTHER DEMONSTRATED. THIS NORTH SOUTH SPLIT. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EVERYBODY COMING UP FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TELLING US THEY WANT THIS PROJECT. EVERYONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIZENS DESTROY OUR WAY OF LIFE IT'S GONNA HAVE MASSIVE IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY ON OUR WATER ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. A AND ON THE DELTA AND I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE. BURKE FURTHER AGENCIES BUT LIVE IN THIS AREA. AND AT AND FEEL THAT AND THERE ARE SO MANY UNKNOWNS QUESTIONS. WE KNOW THAT IN. DO THOUSAND THAT THIRTEEN THE BAY BRIDGE OPENED A SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WE AUTHORIZE ONE POINT THREE BILLION. WE KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THE VOTERS VOTED FOR. THAT THIRTY THREE BILLION BOARD NOW UP TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION. AND WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL I SEE THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THAT. THIS PROJECT WE KNOW VOTERS WHEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY VOTED AGAINST THE TWIN TUNNEL PROJECT EARLIER. AND NOW WE'RE BACK WITH JP IS THAT WE'RE NOT SURE OF THE TERMS ABOUT. WITH POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WE HAVE UNCERTAIN FINANCES. THERE IS NO AGAIN W. SKIP SAYING THERE IS NO NO WATER. AND THEN WE OTHER COURT QUESTIONABLY BILLS WILL WORK ON THIS FOR YEARS YES FOR YEARS PEOPLE BEEN SAYING WE NEED TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES WHAT ABOUT A WESTERN INTAKE BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WE SEEM. HELLBENT. TO GO DOWN THIS PATH. WE SAW A PRINT PENDING PERMITS PENDING LAWSUITS AND WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES THERE ARE SO MANY UNKNOWNS QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. WITH VERY FEW ANSWERS WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE FULL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. ON WAS STILL HAVE THE FULL FINANCIAL ANALYSIS WE STILL ARE NOT UNSURE OF THE FUNDING. UNSURE OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE GPAS. AND YET ALL OF A SUDDEN MORE ON A RACE OUT THE DOOR IT SEEMS LIKE. BEFORE THIS ADMINISTRATION'S IS FINISHED THAT'S BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE.
