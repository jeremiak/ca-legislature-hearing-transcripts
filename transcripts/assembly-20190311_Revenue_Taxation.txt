COMMITTEE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS -- ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB THREE OH EIGHT HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. AND FIRE THEM I FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWO IS WEIGHING FRIESEN TATIAN BUT WE WILL HEAR FROM SUPPORT OPPOSITION AT THE END OF THE HEARING ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WOULD DO LIKE. LIVING THE FILE ITEM EIGHT AB FOUR OH FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR OH FIVE CONCERNING WASTE WATER CHEMICAL TAXATION. CALIFORNIA THE LEADER FOR SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BATTLE CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEVERE IN INTERMITTENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PLACE AND DO FINANCIAL BURDEN ON BENEFICIAL WATER POLICY. WASTE WATER IS AN ACID WITH SUBSTANTIAL VALUE THAT CURRENTLY IS UNDER UTILIZED BY SANITATION DISTRICT'S. CURRENT LAW TAXES THE CHEMICALS USED FOR TREATING WASTE WATER ON AS THE WATER IS DESTINED TO BE RESOLD CONSUMERS. RESELL WATER IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE WATER HANDLED BY SANITATION DISTRICTS. THERE FOR STORAGE OF WASTEWATER CHEMICALS ARE IS A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN. SANITATION DISTRICTS ARE DISCOURAGED FROM STORING ARE INVESTING IN TREATED WASTE WATER DUE TO A BAG TAX CODE AND UNNECESSARY LEGAL STATUTES. AB FOUR OR FIVE WOULD PROMOTE THE RECYCLING OF WASTE WATER BY ADDING A TAX EXEMPTION TO TREATMENT TO TREATMENT OF TREATMENT CHEMICALS. THEREBY ENCOURAGING SANITATION DISTRICTS TO INVEST AND SUSTAINABLE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE OR IN THIS CASE OUT OF YOU THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY. ON AB FOUR OR FIVE THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT UP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO BE RUBIO -- CHAIR THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS -- CHECK UP ALL ON I AM WITH EQUITY RECOVERY SOLUTIONS -- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE WE JUST RECEIVED A LETTER OF SUPPORT WARM THE REGIONAL -- DISTRICT OF SACRAMENTO. SO WE JUST GOT IT SO YOU'D LIKE TO IF WE CAN. DELIVER TO YOU -- OUR NATURAL PROCESS WORKING OFF SERGEANTS GROUND WITH THEIR OKAY THE SERGEANTS AT OUR SO CALIFORNIA HAS A LONGSTANDING EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC UTILITIES DELIVER TO OUR RESIDENTS. WATER IS THE ONLY UTILITY THAT HAS A RETURN COMPONENT OF WASTE WATER. THIS UNIQUE FEATURE CREATES A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION. PUBLIC PUBLIC UTILITIES PAY SALES TAX AND CHEMICALS USED TO TREAT WAIT WHAT WASTE WATER. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T DEEM REVENUE REVENUE TAXATION CODE SIXTY THREE FIFTY THREE TO APPLY TO THE TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER. THE DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENTS APPLICATION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS AND DISCOURAGES RECYCLING IN OTHER GREENER USES -- DO YOU SEE SINCE SAN DIEGO PROFESSOR WATER ECONOMICS HAS RECENTLY WRITTEN. THE CALIFORNIA CAN ENCOURAGE WATER USE BY TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE OPERATIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING WATER. THE STEPS INCLUDE ELIMINATING SALES TAX ON THE CHEMICALS YOU ST. THE WASTE WATER. CHEMICALS ARE THE LARGEST SUPPLY COST FOR THE TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER. ANOTHER KEY FACTOR OF FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE ONLY BENEFIT SURE OF THIS EXEMPTION WILL BE LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. NOT PRIVATE TAXPAYERS. THIS MITIGATES ANY LOSS OF REVENUE TO THE STATE. REVENUES MERELY BEING SHIFTED. BACK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE ANNUAL REVENUE SHIFT AT TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL WHICH IS WHAT OUR ESTIMATE IS IS VERY MINIMAL TO THE OVERALL SALES TAX COLLECTOR. AND WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH. WOULD BE FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE INCREASED VALUE OF EFFICIENT USE OF WATER. THIS IS A WIN WIN SITUATION THE REVISION REDUCES THE TAX BURDEN ON LOCAL PUBLIC AT UTILITIES. REDUCES THE COST OF RECYCLING WATER VERSUS THE COST OF IMPORTING WATER. AND PROMOTES ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ACTIONS. ULTIMATELY BOTH AND ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANT TO FIRST THANK OF THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CARRYING THIS EITHER AUTHORING THE SUPPORT LEGISLATION THANK YOU. TO CHAIR AUTUMN BURKE AND TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO STAFF FOR YOUR DILIGENCE IN. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND AND THE AND NOW AND AND AND READ. AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER BOLAN STATED OF THE POLICY EXEMPTIONS FOR THIS REASON OR STRONG BY THE WAY MY NAME FOR THE RECORD IS MARTY TO CASSIE AND I'M A LAWYER -- REPRESENTING -- CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THE POLICY REASONS FOR THE EXEMPTION ARE ARE STRONG AND THE LEGAL REASONS. FOR NEEDING THE EXEMPTION ARE SIMILARLY STRONG WE HAVE A LACK OF CLARITY IN THE CURRENT COACH SIXTY THREE FIFTY THREE WE BELIEVE. HAS -- ENOUGH TEXTUAL SUPPORT FOR THE EXEMPTION BUT THE LACK OF CLARITY THE AMBIGUITY DESERVES. DESERVES -- LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD WOULD CLARIFY THAT THAT THIS EXEMPTION DOES IN FACT -- APPLY TO PUBLIC UTILITIES IN THEIR SERVICE OF RECYCLED WATER AND WASTEWATER. I WOULD SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT WE WROTE WE WE SALUTE THAT THE THE ANALYSIS THAT STAFF PUT TOGETHER I THOUGHT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL VERY THOROUGH. WE ARE AT IN AGREEMENT ON A COUPLE OF ONE WITH RESPECT. TO THE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THIS EXEMPTION WOULD APPLY ONLY TO PUBLIC ENTITIES. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT A CATCH -- THAT -- THAT THAT STAFF PICKED UP ON WE SUPPORT THAT WERE ALSO OF SUPPORTIVE OF THE AT THE DELAYED OPERATIVE DATE. AND ASIDE FROM THAT -- ASIDE FROM THAT WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND THANK YOU AGAIN TO EVERYBODY WHO'S TAKEN THE TIME. INCLUDING THE AUTHOR CHAIR COMMITTEE AND STUFF. THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM OF THAILAND WE CALL THE ROLL. BURKE HERE. ROOM HERE TOO GRAY. MATHIS MELINDA'S MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS QUIRK [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] REVERSE [inaudible] KING. WE HAVE COURT APARTMENT. SO JUST TO CONFIRM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO EIGHT ARE YOU YOU TO ALSO JUST WANT IT FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES YES OKAY THAT'S JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT ALL RIGHT WHEN OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN IS IS IN OPPOSITION? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MEMBER CORBIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY WILL CLARIFY WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME -- YOU'LL HEAR ME SAY THAT A COUPLE TIMES TODAY WE ACTUALLY HAVE NOT TAKEN A COUPLE POLICY POSITION JET ON SOME MATTERS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY -- OF COURSE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS REPRESENT A THIRD OF THE STATE'S REVENUES SEE CHERRY AS PART OF A LARGER COALITION INCLUDING. EDUCATION CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES AND PUBLIC LABOR IS ASKING THE STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR TO REALLY GO BACK AND LOOK AT A NUMBER OF THE STATE'S -- S. U. T. AND CORPORATE TAXES AND REEVALUATE OF THOSE ARE IN FACT MEETING THEIR INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OUTCOMES. TRADITIONALLY WE DO OPPOSE EXEMPTIONS AND CREDIT AWFUL NATURE OF THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE START QUIRK -- SO THE BILL DOESN'T SAY RECYCLED WATER IT SAYS WATER RECYCLED WATER OR WASTEWATER AND YOU MENTION RECYCLED WATER AND WASTEWATER BUT IT'S FOR WATER AS WELL. JUST ORDINARY WATER TREATMENT. YES THAT IS CORRECT SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE LARGEST PART OF THE EXEMPTION SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN CALL THIS A WASTE WATER RECYCLING BILL UNLESS YOU WANT TO AMENDED THAT'S COURSE UP TO THE AUTHOR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF RUBIO BUT IT DOES STATE WATER AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LARGEST -- IMPACT IN TERMS OF MONEY I DO REALIZE THE CHEMICALS THAT END UP IN THE WATER AND OUR BENEFICIAL ARE NOT TAX BUT OTHER ITEMS WHICH ARE USED TO PURIFY WATER SUCH AS FLOCKING AGENTS WOULD BE. AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WATER PURIFICATION AND WASTE WATER A RECYCLED WATER. ACTUALLY IT YOU'RE PARTIALLY CORRECT IN THAT IN THAT CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FORMALLY THE BOARD -- HAS TREATED. WHAT THEY CALL PORTABLE WATER WHICH IS WHAT'S DELIVER THROUGH -- TO TO OUR TAPS OVER WHAT WE DRINK. ALMOST ALL THE CHEMICALS THAT GO INTO THE POTABLE WATER HAVE ALWAYS HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCEPT. THEY HAVE NEARLY APPLIED SIXTY TWO FIFTY THREE JUST TO THE PORTABLE WATER THEY'VE IGNORED. THE WASTE WATER IN THE RECYCLED WATER PORTION. YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE TAXES ALREADY OWNED WATER WHEN THEY'RE USING AGENTS THE DON'T END UP IN THE WATER. SUCH AS THE FLOCK IN NATURE THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY AS HISTORICAL VERY OLD HISTORICAL RULINGS THAT ACTUALLY THEM EXEMPTED DOCUMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR PROBABLY TWENTY THIRTY MAYBE FOR YOUR OKAY. SO THERE'S A WHOLE RACK CASE LAW THAT EXEMPTS THE FOUR O'CLOCK ABOUT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP OKAY THERE'S CASE HOWEVER YEAH. SO. SO WHY INCLUDE WATER RATHER THAN -- YOU KNOW IF YOUR MAIN QUESTION IS RECYCLED WATER WASTE WATER WHY YOU INCLUDING WATER AS WELL YOU JUST ADDING SOMETHING WHICH COULD ADD TO CONFUSION LATER ON THE DAY THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE THAT I SEE IT AS A PRACTITIONER IN THE IN THE MARKET. PLACES ARE IN THE OPEN IN INDUSTRIES. THAT THE TAX -- THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY. FLUCTUATES IN SOMETIMES IN THE WAY THAT THEY REACT AND AND AND ADMINISTER THE LAW AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS AND AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WATER. IT IS REALLY ONE THING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT A BILL WHEN YOU BUY YOUR WATER AND YOU GET IT DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME. YOU LOOK AT THE UTILITY BILL THERE'S A CHARGE FOR THE WATER WILL BURIED IN THAT IS THE WASTE WATER SO IT'S REALLY ONE PROCESS. WELL DEPENDS ON YOUR JURISDICTION. IN SOME IN SOME JURISDICTIONS IT'S DIFFERENT IF THEY HAVE A WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND A WATER TREATMENT. FACILITY. I THOUGHT -- SO WOULD IT THIS GOES. TO ALRIGHT SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL WASTE WATER NOT JUST WATER THAT'S RECYCLED. I I JUST DON'T SEE IT SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE THIS IS GIVING A TAX EXEMPTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE ANYWAY. AND THEREFORE WHAT IS THE BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF NOT RECEIVING THAT REVENUE I CAN UNDERSTAND IF FOR RECYCLED WATER MADE. WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE ALREADY. AND NOW YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S REQUIRED PEOPLE PAY FOR IT ON THEIR BILLS IT'S NOT A TAX IT'S A IT'S A FEE FOR YOU KNOW HAVING THAT -- SEWERS I I JUST DON'T SEE WHY THE STATE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT. AND BE GIVING A BREAK ON THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT LOCALITIES COUNTIES CITIES AT CETERA WHEN YOU SAY THAT THERE'S A SALES TAX BREAKS SO IT'S IT'S MUCH. AND AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO BE MUCH LARGER THE MOUNT OF RECYCLED WATER THAT'S DONE IS REALLY VERY SMALL COMPARED TO WASTE WATER. IF IF WE WE'VE DONE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE KNOW WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE. A 1% INCREASE IN THE THE PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED WATER. WOULD OUTWEIGH THE SAVING ON THE COSTS THE TO THAT STATE PROBABLY BY ABOUT SIX TO TEN PEOPLE. SO I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE EXEMPTING WASTE WATER IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A SPECIAL INTEREST AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING YOU REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE -- I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT WELL THERE IS ONE OTHER THING. YOU SAID YOUR LAWYER FOR TAXPAYERS UP -- A SENIOR WHO IS YOUR CLIENT NOW THAT YOU'RE TESTIFYING ON THIS BILL. SAMANTHA CORBIN HERE I'M I'M THE QUESTION IS WHO IS MY CLIENT I REPRESENT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CLIENTS -- THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE PUBLIC ENTITIES ONLY. OKAY SO YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC CANDIDATES EXCLUSIVELY NO YES YEAH NO ONE ELSE THAT I HAVE THAT WAS NOT AT ALL NO THAT'S FINE THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS YOUR CLIENT IN THIS THAT'S FINE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WHICH LIKE CLOSE YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE I THIS FOR TEST TODAY'S ALL OF THE BILLS THERE ON FOR TESTIMONY ONLY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LIVING A FILE ITEM NUMBER. SIXTY NO WE A STRING. OF MOVING A FILE ITEM SIX AB THREE FORTY SEVEN DOCTOR CHOI WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BURKE A HAND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TODAY I'M A PRESENTING AB THREE FORTY SEVEN TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA SO PRESCHOOLERS. THE STATE WIDE TO STUDY CONDUCTED THE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. HAD TO MAKE A HARD CHOICE BETWEEN ONE PARENT LEAVING THE WORK FORCE TO STAY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN. AND THE PRESCHOOL. THIS STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THIS MEANS. THE COST OF A PRESCHOOL WAS SO TO EXPENSIVE FOR FAMILIES. TO AFFORD EVEN WITH THE A TO OUR FAMILY INCOME. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS. UNDER. AVAILABILITY OF FOR LAWYER INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AB THREE FORTY SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AT THE PERFECT PILOT THE PROGRAM TO ACCOMPLISH JUST THAT. WITH THE FIVE YEAR OLD SUNSET AND THE SECTION FORTY ONE REQUIREMENTS ARE CLEARLY IN THE DOLLAR. I THINK IT A. B. THREE FORTY SEVEN IS AN EASY PILOT PROGRAM THAT THAT WE CAN OR SUPPORT. OUT WITH THE ARE. OUT WITH ME TODAY SO GAVE -- TESTIMONY AND SAW THE NINA MICHELLE ATTY CORD BURNED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF A CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE A PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION KNOWN AS A CAP -- TO GIVE FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE ISSUE -- THREE FORTY SEVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DINEEN MICHELETTI COLBERN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION -- ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS ARE MIXED DELIVERY -- PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT SUPPORT OUR POOREST OF WORKING FAMILIES WITH ACCESS TO CHILDCARE IN ADDITION TO A HOST OF OTHER SERVICES -- TO SUPPORT FAMILIES. ELEVATING OUT OF POVERTY -- SERVICES SUCH AS HOW THE HOUSING CLOTHING AND FOOD. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE UNMET NEED FOR FAMILIES TO ACCESS CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS. FOR OUR WORKING POOR FAMILIES IN THOSE FAMILY AIDED BY POVERTY THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE GRAVE. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. I RELEASED LAST MONTH THERE ARE OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION INCOME ELIGIBLE CHILDREN CHILD CARE. SO WHAT DO I MEAN IN CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION CHILD CARE WAS INCLUDED. UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN CHILD CARE. MOST OF CHILD CARE OUTSIDE OF PART OF PRESCHOOL WE STAYED IN PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT COUPLED WITH THAT THERE WAS A HUGE CUT IN THE ACCESS FOR FAMILIES TO CHILD CARE. AND THE SLOTS -- TO THIS DAY HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY RESTORED. IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS THE BUDGET ENACTED HAVE FUNDED MANY PRESCHOOL BUT SOME FUNDING. HAS BEEN RETURNED -- SOME PRESCHOOL SLOT FUNDING HAS BEEN RETURNED DUE TO THE LACK OF CAPACITY THIS YEAR WE'RE REAL HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS EMBRACED A MIX A LIVERY SYSTEM. OF CHILD CARE ACCESS -- SO WE'RE HOPING THAT ALL THE SLOTS GET MAXIMIZED -- I BRING -- AT THE HISTORY OF CHILD CARE FUNDING -- BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO MORE FUNDING THAT IS NEEDED IN THE STATE -- CALIFORNIA ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES EXISTING WHAT WE CALL A CHILD CARE DESERT. SO IN ADDITION TO PRESCHOOL BIRTH THE THREE LESS THAN 5% OF THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE EVEN HAVE ACCESS OR CONFINED TO PRESCHOOL OR I'M SORRY CAN FIND AN INFANT OR TODDLER PROVIDE WHEN YOU THROUGHOUT HAVE A AN ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEM. AB THREE FOUR SEVEN PROVIDE TO CREATE A PROPOSAL THAT MAY GENERATE MONIES TO FIVE COUNTIES WITH LARGE WAITING LISTS. ARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS HOST THESE WAITING LISTS AND WE CAN HELP SUPPORT IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE COUNTIES ARE. BY DOING THIS MORE FAMILIES CAN IMMEDIATELY BE SUPPORTED AND OUR MOST FRAGILE OF CHILDREN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO OBTAIN GREATER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. FOR NOW I AM THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CAPCOM PRESENT. FOR WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MEET THE CARBON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION -- WE HAVE NOT FORMALLY TAKEN A POSITION YET THOUGH EXPECT WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSE THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE AS WRITTEN CERTAINLY WE AGREE WITH THE NEED FOR MORE FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE AND ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS -- HOWEVER THE STATE HAS TAKEN GREAT EFFORTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES -- A VARIETY OF OPTIONS TO MITIGATE FOR THESE NEEDS AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IN A MUCH LARGER ARENA PARTICULARLY AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AS A GENERAL RULE -- SEE TERRY'S POSITION IS THAT THESE TYPE OF PROGRAMS TEND TO BE THE LEAST EFFICIENT WAY TO PROVIDE FUNDS. TO THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS WHILE POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING OTHER STATE CRITICAL PROGRAM SO DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS HERE TO SOARED MITIGATE THE IMPACTS ON PROP -- NINETY EIGHT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND I'M SURE TAKING A POSITION SOON THANK. ADDITIONAL ESSES IN OPPOSITION COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUIRK -- SO IS ME. BOB. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A TAX DEDUCTION. OUR I AM OPPOSED TO ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS ARE ONLY REALLY HELP THE PEOPLE HAVE A VERY HIGH TAX RATE THE 13% FOR MILLIONAIRES. A MOST PEOPLE ARE PAYING MUCH LOWER RATES IN THEIR FORGET MUCH LESS OF A BENEFIT. SO I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TRY IN INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR WITH TAX DEDUCTIONS PERHAPS TAX CREDITS AND WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE CHAIR RECOMMENDS LATER ON BUT I'D TO TAX DEDUCTION PART OF IT.

BE DEL A LOCAL LAW HIGH SCHOOL ORDER HISTORY TEACHER ABOUT THE HOUSE AT THIS MEASURE. AND THE EFFECTS OF A IT IS -- HAVING ONE ON ONE TEACHERS. HELLO -- THANKS FOR LETTING ME -- GIVE MY PIECE AND SHARE MY TWO CENTS YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME I'M IN TEACHER MODE AS GOOD ON TEACHING A HUNDRED TWENTY TEENAGERS SO -- HOPE I'M NOT TOO INFORMAL HERE -- JUST A BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND I'VE TAUGHT FOR OVER A DECADE OF TAUGHT IN TWO STATES ORGAN CALIFORNIA. I'VE TAUGHT AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER K. THROUGH TWELVE OF TOP MIDDLE SCHOOL AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M CRY TEACHING AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN ROSEVILLE -- IT'S NO SECRET THAT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY TEACHERS AT SOME POINT IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IF YOU TO ASK THEM. WHO'S THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL PERSON IN YOUR LIFE WAS INSPIRED YOU THE MOST TO ACHIEVE THE HEIGHTS MOST PEOPLE MENTION A TEACHER -- AND IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ACROSS AMERICA THERE'S BEEN -- MULTIFARIOUS TEACHERS TREE LIMBS CORRAL OFF A FEW WEST VIRGINIA DENVER THE STATE OF WASHINGTON KENTUCKY OKLAHOMA ARIZONA AND HERE IN OUR OWN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OAKLAND IN LOS ANGELES -- WHERE TEACHERS STRIKING THE COULD BE MYRIAD REASONS FOR THAT BUT I THINK ONE OF THEM IS MAYBE A LACK OF UNDER PEACH ATION RIGHT? AND ALL STAR LIKE APPRECIATION AND ALSO A LACK OF OF PAY. IT'S EXPENSIVE -- THIS DAY IN AGE ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALSO TOUGH AS A TEACHER WHEN YOU SEE NEEDS IN YOUR CLASSROOM AND YOU WANT TO MEET THOSE NEEDS -- THERE'S JUST A LIST I JOHN OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THINGS I SUPPLY FOR MY SCHOLARS IN MY STUDENTS AND THIS IS ALSO FOR SOME MY COLLEAGUES. THINGS THE CLASSROOM AND AS SOMEONE CHOI SAID THIS IS NOT JUST -- WHAT THE SCHOOL HAS REIMBURSED US FOR BECAUSE OFTENTIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL SAY HEY? HOW MUCH SHOULD BE SPENT FOR CLASSROOM? HERE'S A LITTLE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT -- PENCILS PENS HIGHLIGHTERS RULERS WIDEOUT BINDERS SCISSORS COLORED PENCILS MARKERS. PERMANENT MARKERS CRAYONS CONSTRUCTION PAPER GLUE ERASERS NO CARDS -- IN THOSE HYGIENE PRODUCTS WE HAVE THINGS LIKE HAIR CLIPS BOBBY PINS DEODORANT ETCETERA THERE'S ALSO. CLASSROOM SUPPLIES LIKE THAT THAT ARE FOR CLASS USE IN THIS CLASSROOM SUPPLIES THAT ARE FOR MY TEACHER USE AS WELL. AND THEN INSTRUCTIONAL USE UNDER FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY I KNOW FROM DOING A UNIT ON ANCIENT GREECE I WANT TO BONE UP ON ANCIENT GREECE SO I'LL GET DVDS AUGUST AND POSTERSALL GET SOME ARTWORK I'LL PUT IT UP ON THE CLASSROOM FOR MY STUDENTS. AND THE REASON WHY WE DON'T HESITATE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE AS A MAJORITY SAID WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS ON AVERAGE. THAT'S NOT MEMBERS FIRST WE'LL DO ANYTHING. SELECT A SPARK FOR OUR STUDENTS ANYTHING US TEACHING IS NOT A CAREER IT'S A CALLING. AND IT'S A DREAM AND I WAS START OFF THE YEAR WITH MY STUDENTS MUST OFFER THE AUGUSTINE CLOSES EVERY TEACHER'S JOB. IS TO HAVE EVERY STUDENT COMES IN THE DOORS INSTRUCTED pI THINK MOST TEACHERS THEY STAY IN AND RESIDE IN THE REALM OF INSTRUCTION BUT FOR ME IN SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES WE TRY TO GET THEM TO THE DELIGHTED OTHER DELIGHTED WITH THEIR EDUCATION. AND TO GET THEM TO THE FURTHER AND CAN YOU MOVE YOUR STUDENTS WHEN THEY LEAVE THE CLASSROOM CAN THEY SAY HEY I CAN'T WALK OUT OF THIS CLASS FROM THE WAY I WALKED IN A LITTLE MOVED. BY THE MATERIAL TODAY -- THERE'S A SAYING MAYBE PART OF IT IF MAMA I AIN'T HAPPY HOME A NOBODY HAPPY RIGHT -- IN THE CLASSROOM STUDENTS CAN TELL THE TEACHERS NOT HAPPY RIGHT IT AFFECTS LEARNING ENVIRONMENT -- I THINK IF YOU WERE A STRONGLY CONSIDER THE BILL IS BEING PROPOSED HERE THIS IS WHAT. YOU WOULD BE COMMUNICATED THE TEACHERS A CALIFORNIA YOU BE SAYING SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES REMEMBER WE'RE STATE WORKERS WE WORK FOR THE PEOPLE RIGHT -- THIS BILL BE COMMITTEE CAN THIS WE CARE ABOUT YOU TEACHERS WE NOTICE YOU WE CARE ABOUT OUR STUDENTS -- WE WANT TO HELP YOU AN IMMEDIATE AND PRACTICAL WAY WITH THIS TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX CREDIT. I TOOK THE LIBERTY LOOKING UP SOME TAX CREDITS YOUR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IT IS TAX SEASON AND HERE'S SOME TAX CREDITS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY PROVIDES FOR NOBLE PURPOSES. THERE'S A COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT THERE'S A DISASTER LOS TAX CREDIT THERE'S MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF. TAX CREDIT IS A TAX CREDIT ON EARNED IN TAX CREDIT ON NONREFUNDABLE RENTERS AND THERE'S A MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT. THOSE ARE ALL WORTHY ENDEAVORS BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN HONESTLY TELL ME THAT THOSE ENDEAVORS OR MORE NOBLE. THAN THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING -- SOME OF YOU. HAVE DAUGHTERS SONS IN SCHOOLS AS WE SPEAK AND WE'RE RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CLASSROOM IN ONE GENERATION. BECOMES THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE GOVERNMENT THE NEXT GENERATION SO IT'S CRUCIAL WE TEACH OUR KIDS WELL. TEACHERS ARE HAPPY TEACHER STILL PRE SHADED HELPS US IN THE CLASSROOM AND AS THE DOCTOR MISTER DOCTOR CHOICE SAID THE THIS WOULD JUST BE A TEMPORARY BAND IT IS NOT A PERMANENT. SOLUTION -- AND WHY THE MONEY FOR THE TEACHERS FOR US AND WHY NOT DISPENSED THE MONEY FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OFTENTIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- THEY HAVE SO MANY NEEDS AND SO MANY THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF NEW COMPUTERS NEW BUILDINGS NEW VICE PRINCIPALS OFTENTIMES TEACHERS WE DON'T QUITE GET THAT MONEY IN OUR POCKETS RATE. SO THAT'S WHY WOULD BE HELPFUL -- I NORTH TOP OF MY HEAD TALKING SO MY COLLEAGUES MY FRIEND WORKS IN ROCKLAND SHE ONLY GETS A HUNDRED DOLLARS STIPEND AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR WHICH SHE SPENDS ON THE CLASSROOM -- I TAUGHT IN THE THOMAS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY GAVE ME ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH YEAR -- AND MY SCHOOL NON ROSEVILLE THEY'D REIMBURSE ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -- SO THE FIVE HEARD OR AVERAGE IS IN THAT WERE BEING REIMBURSED -- SO I WILL -- ALL CLOSE WITH THE JUST MISTER CHURCHILL QUOTE AS YOU SEE I'M A LOVER OF QUOTES -- HE SAID THIS THERE'S NO FINER INVESTMENT FOR ANY COMMUNITY THAN PUTTING MILK INTO BABIES -- EXCUSE THE PROVERBIAL REFERENCE TO MILL BUT WE ARE PUTTING DREAMS AND HOPES AND EDUCATION. AND LIFE SKILLS AND CHARACTER AND VALUE INTO OUR STUDENTS. AND THE MORE MILK FOR THE WE HAVE THIS BEING REIMBURSED THE MORE WE GIVE OUR KIDS AS WE GET THAT TAX CREDIT. IT WOULD JUST BE A NICE. AND NOBLE GESTURE FOR EVERY TEACHER WOULD FEEL LIKE CALIFORNIA HAS ARE BACK LIKE CALIFORNIA BE. KEEPING US TEACHERS IN MINE -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU TO SHOW INNOCENCE IN SUPPORT. RENOWNED REPUTATION OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE WORD WE HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED. POSITION -- LOOKING TO SEE A BETTER FOCUS ON JUST. TEACHERS IN THEIR FIRST THREE YEARS OF SERVICE WHEN THEY'RE THE MOST ALL [inaudible] AB -- WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MET THE CORPORATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE WILL BE MOVING TO TAKE AND OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL AS WE HAVE WITH BILLS OF A SIMILAR NATURE IN THE PAST -- I WOULD NOTE THIS WAS A TAX CREDIT -- THAT CALIFORNIA HAD IN THE PAST HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE LAST TIME THAT IT WAS IN FACT ENACTED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROBLEM A. B. H. SHARE OF THAT. 40% ESSENTIALLY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING REDUCE FROM KIDDER FOURTEEN SCHOOLS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY MILLION. AND SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN VERSUS AG CONVERSATION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES -- OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE WELL YOU MAY BE GIVING BACK TO EDUCATORS WHO ARE IN FACT UNDERMINING THE FUND THAT SUPPORTS THEIR SALARIES THAT SUPPORTS THEIR PENSIONS -- THAT SUPPORTS ALL OF THE OTHER RESOURCES INDICATOR FOURTEEN ENVIRONMENT -- I WOULD MENTION THAT SEE CHERRIES BOARD IS COMPRISED OF PUBLIC LABOR AS WELL AS CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY GROUPS AND PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS AMONG OUR MEMBERS ARE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION ON THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. WHO ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY TAKEN OPPOSED POSITIONS ON -- MEASURES SUCH AS THIS I WILL NOT SEPARATELY HOWEVER THERE'S AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION TO BE HAD PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF CONVERSATIONS REGARDING FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY. AS THIS IS ACTUALLY NOW OUT OF CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL TAX LAWS IT'S ONE THAT AS OURSELVES AT C. CHERRY ALONG WITH PARTNERS IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY ARE LOOKING OUT ON A MUCH BROADER PERSPECTIVE. AND SO WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR IN PARTICULAR TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY A CONVERSATION THANK YOU. I WOULD TO OFFER THE SAME RECOMMENDATION TO THE AUTHOR -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. THIRTY TWO I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AB THIRTY EIGHT SIMPLY CREATES A TAX CREDIT UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE NOT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO ENTIRE AVERAGE. TEACHERS SPENT THE FOR EACH TEACHER IN DIRECTOR. OF COMPENSATION FOR SUPPLIES SUPPORT JUST TO FOR THE CLASSROOM WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE A TOOL TO HELP US DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EDUCATION FUNDING. LET US TO GIVE A TEACHERS A SMALL AMOUNT OF HELP OF FOR THEIR SELFLESS SERVICE. WHY LAW WE DETERMINE HOW TO ALLEVIATE THE ISSUES OF A SCORE SUPPLY DEFICIENCIES? I RESPECTFULLY ASK OF FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THE WHEN YOU COME TO THE BALL. I THINK YOU MIGHT AND JUST AS A NOTE MIND TWO SISTERS -- LIFELONG EDUCATOR AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLE THAT YOUR TRUCK THE THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX N&lt;c.cyan&gt; I&lt;/c&gt; WOULD SAY LIKE THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT CONFORMITY ON THE FEDERAL. WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS AN ISSUE HE AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS MAYBE WE MAY MIGHT MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. IN THE MIDST OF THAT CONVERSATION YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR TRYING. TO MOVING TO FILE ITEM FOR AB. TWO EIGHTY TWO MR VOEPEL WOULD YOU LIKE. TO OPEN. MADAM CHAIR AND HONORED COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT ALPHA BRAVO. TWO EIGHT TWO WHICH WOULD GIVE A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT TO INDIVIDUALS THAT PURCHASE A BRAND NEW HOUSE. THIS TAX CREDIT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES WHO BUY A BRAND NEW HOME. THAT HAS FINISHED COMPLETION ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWO ZERO TWO ONE THIS CREDIT CANNOT BE PASSED TO THE SECOND BUYER OF THE NEW HOUSE. AB TWO EIGHT TWO IS TO BEGIN DURING THE TAXABLE YEAR OF JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TILL JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE WHICH MEANS IT'S BASICALLY A PILOT PROGRAM TO SEE IF THAT WILL STIMULATE NEW HOUSING. CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST HOUSING COSTS IN THE COUNTRY IN FACT THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO EXTER TAX INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE WHO BUY HOMES AB. TWO EIGHT TWO INTENDS TO INCREASE SUPPORT AND INCENTIVES TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ENTERING THE HOUSING MARKET. RIGHT NOW POOR PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE. MIDDLE CLASS IS STRUGGLING TO BUY A HOUSE. AND THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS IS SELLING THEIR HOUSES AND LEAVING CALIFORNIA [inaudible] SO [inaudible] ANYTHING. WE CAN DO. TO ENCOURAGE A SPECIALLY MILLENNIALS AND NEW PEOPLE COMING INTO THE HOUSE MARKET IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA. BASED ON A REPORT GOVERNOR BROWN WHO? I MISS GREATLY. I LIVE I LOVE THAT GUY HE WAS GREAT. BY THE WAY ON THE RECORD. HE SAID REGARDING THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS STATED THAT CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY BUILDING EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR WHICH IS FAR BELOW THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES PER YEAR IN ORDER TO LIVE CALIFORNIA OUT OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. AB TWO IS EIGHTY TWO WOULD GIVE THOSE HOME BUYERS AND EXTRAS CENTER TO BUY A BRAND NEW HOME WHICH WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE HOME BUILDERS TO BUILD MORE HOMES AT A FASTER RATE [inaudible] SO. I HOPE YOU SUPPORT AB TWO EIGHTY TWO WHICH WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER A TAX CREDIT LIKE THIS WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL WAY TOWARDS MAKING. BUYING A NEW HOME BETTER. AND JUST SIMPLY WORTH IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU JUST SIT IN THE FRONT ROW. WE GET RESERVE ME A CHAIR THOUGH FOR WE MAY WE MAY. SOME OF THE CARBON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. STAFF CERTAINLY THERE THERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN I THINK MEASURES RELATED TO TAX CREDITS OR EXPENDITURES THIS YEAR ALL BUT TEN OF THEM I THINK ARE IN THE ASSEMBLY SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD WORK OF YOUR STAFF [inaudible] WERE. STILL FORMALIZING OUR POSITIONS BUT ON THIS ONE I ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE IN OPPOSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO ANOTHER MEASURE BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGARDING TAX -- CREDITS FOR THOSE WHO.

I'M JOINED BY SYLVIA SILLY SHAW -- FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND TONI BREWING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IT IS A SPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE OFFICE OF CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN MENTIONED -- THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WAS A BECAUSE VERY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE CITY WE LOST APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE MULTI FAMILY SOFT STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS -- AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT RISK THAT WE WILL FACE A SIMILAR ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE OF SIMILAR GREATER MAGNITUDE -- BECAUSE OF THIS MAYOR GARCETTI IN THE CITY HAVE ADOPTED SOME OF THE NATION'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE EARTHQUAKE RETROFIT LAWS. WHICH REQUIRE THE RETROFIT OF SOFT STORY AND CONCRETE BUILDINGS -- WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT WILL ENCOURAGE BUILDING OWNERS TO RETROFIT. THE SEISMICALLY AT RISK BUILDINGS BY PROVIDING SOME FINANCIAL RELIEF TO BUILDING OWNERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS WHILE HELPING TO PRESERVE SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN THE CITY. A GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EXISTING HOUSING CRISIS -- EARTHQUAKE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD BE DEVASTATING SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS TWENTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- TWO THREE FOUR AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED THIS BILL CREATES TAX CREDIT. FOR OF WILL PROPERTY OWNERS TO SEISMICALLY RETROFIT THEIR BUILDINGS -- WHILE OLDER BUT INFRASTRUCTURE COURTS BUILDING CODES IN PLACE AT THE TIME OF NEW STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT SOME OF THOSE BUILDINGS MAY NOT SURVIVE A STRONG EARTHQUAKE TODAY -- ALSO AS MENTIONED THE BILL WOULD COURAGE'S WOULD ENCOURAGE PROPERTY OWNERS. TO WORKED ON THE BUILDING STRUCTURE THEIR SEISMICALLY SAFE -- ALL THAT SAID. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES PART. STATE FARM INSURANCE DEFINITELY YOU LETTER IN ON HIM TO MEET ME THERE [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR [inaudible] NICHOLAS. CREATE THE AUTHOR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US THANK YOU. JOHN DEERE BONE BEHALF OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES AND THE SAN OF OUR RENTAL PROPERTIES SO STATION ALSO SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AT CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF RANCOR STING APRAKSIN STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HERE REPRESENTING THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION. WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION AT ON THIS BILL BUT WE APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY MINFORD CONTINUE TO BE THE CHAMPION FOR SEISMIC RETROFIT AND SAFETY. IT REALLY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM ON FINE TUNING SOME THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN PARTICULAR. WE REALLY ARE FOCUSING ON LOCAL PROGRAMS AND WE THINK ENCOURAGING. WE HAD SOME GOOD CITIES IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP BUT IS HE SAID IT'S BEEN A HANDFUL. AND WE REALLY NEED TO THE LOOK AT THIS AS AN INCENTIVE NOT JUST FOR PERSONAL HOMEOWNERS OR BUSINESS OWNERS BUT ACTUALLY THAT CENTER FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS. TO TAKE THAT STEP AS WELL SO WE LIKE TO BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAMANTHA CORNER THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION AT THIS TIME MY MY MEETING ACTUALLY PRIOR TO THIS WAS IN CONVERSATION WITH YOUR OFFICE. MR AUTHOR I AND SO HOPE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY WE'VE OPPOSED PREVIOUS EFFORTS BUT HAVE WATCHED YOU CONTINUE -- INTELLIGENCE DRILLING DOWN ON THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA AND PREPS YOUR ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION WHICH IS [inaudible] IF BOB. PERSON IS REQUIRED TO DO THE SEISMIC RETROFIT. AS OPPOSED TO DOING IT VOLUNTARILY WOULD THEY STILL GET THE TAX. ADVANTAGE YES SO MY CONCERN WITH THAT IS THE POINT OF THE TACK OF HAVING A TAX ADVANTAGE. IS TO ENCOURAGE CERTAIN BEHAVIOR THIS IS JUST A SUBSIDY FOR BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. AND AND THAT'S MY CONCERN IF YOU WERE JUST FOR VOLUNTARY I WOULD LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY THANK YOU. DO YOU WOULD YOU LIKE ME. TO SURE I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE ANSWER. AND AND MADAM CHAIR I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP YOUR TIME IF THERE'S ANYONE WAITING NO NO NO NO AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO WE THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE DO WANT TO HAVE SO PLEASE FREE. GRAY I BY THE WAY I LOOK THE SAME PURE LENS THAT YOU DO WHY BUILT IN INCENTIVE YOU KNOW INCENTIVE AND THEN TRY TO MEET THAT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- THE CHAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I HAD BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD A PLEA FOR YEARS AGO AND IT WAS VETOED. AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROAD VETO OF NINE TAX CREDIT BILLS IF YOU RECALL BECAUSE OF THE MCO ISSUE -- THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR -- SO IT PART OF THE REASON WHY I HAD BROUGHT THAT UP AT THAT TIME WAS CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES WERE LOOKING AT OF REQUIRING. BUILDING OWNERS TO GO THROUGH THE RETROFIT BUT WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM ANY RELIEF FOR OPTION AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS WELL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT. THEY CAN ABSORB ALL THE COST EITHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PASS IT TO THEIR TENANTS. SO IF WE DON'T OFFER THE RELIEF THAT IS NECESSARY I'M AFRAID THAT A LOT OF OUR TENANTS -- ARE GOING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE COST AND THIS IS JUST OUR WAY OF TRYING TO HELP. OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF SO THAT. BOTH OF OUR TENANTS THE TENANTS IN BOTH OF OUR DISTRICTS ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. ARE ABLE TO NOT PAY WHAT WOULD OF OTHERWHAT WOULD OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY IF THERE WAS NO STATE COMPENSATION OKAY SO BASICALLY THIS IS LIKE A GRANT PROGRAM FOR RICHER FITS IN THE FACT. IT'S JUST A NOTED MINISTERED THROUGH THE TAXCODE AND THE OTHER POINT I WHICH IS EASIER THAN A GRANT PROGRAM. BEAU BUT THE OTHER POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE ALL SEAHAWKS POSITION ON THIS ALSO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S LIMITING TO SOME EXTENT TO JUST SAY THAT. IT SHOULD ONLY GO TOWARDS A CERTAIN SUBSET OF FOLKS WHO ARE WILLING TO MAKE. THE THE CHANGES -- THE DIRECTOR FITS THAT'S WHY IT WAS OPEN. FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO APPLY -- BUT WHAT WILL END UP HAPPENING CURRENTLY AT LEAST IS WHOEVER IS UNDER REQUIREMENT WILL PROBABLY WANT TO GET IN LINE FIRST. IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT -- I THINK WESHOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OF INCENTIVIZING THAT COMPLIMENTS. POTENTIALLY THIS EFFORT SHOULD THIS BILL PASS. IN ORDER FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS. TO THE MUCH NEEDED DOLLARS BECAUSE WHAT EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IN NOW. IS SAVING QUITE A BIT OF DOLLARS. WHEN A DISASTER DOES HAPPEN AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT? QUITE A BIT WE'RE WE'RE ARIZONA USE THIS AS AN ANECDOTE BUT ARIZONA -- A YEAR AGO WAS HAVING DRILLS ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THAT. THERE WILL BE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA REFUGEES -- MOVING TO THE STATE AFTER DISPLACEMENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE THEY'RE ALREADY MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THAT. SO IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE OPTION WE NEED TO LOOK AT SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONS AND REVOLVING FUNDS POSSIBLY. OF OF PROVIDING THIS MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT RATHER THAN CURTAILING THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I THINK SOONER OR LATER. MANY MORE JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING TO JUMP ON BOARD I THINK IF WE KEEP IT OPEN WE'RE HELPING INCENTIVIZE MORE FOLKS TO WANT TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE. TO VOLUNTARILY. BUT TO BE JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR THE BILL AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW PROVIDES THAT SEISMIC RETROFIT CONSTRUCTION DOES NOT INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION PERFORMED TO BRING. A BUILDING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL BUILDING CODES SO IT RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT READS IT DOES READ THAT -- INCENTIVIZING BUT THIS IS THE DIRECTION I BELIEVE AUTHORS TRYING TO GO. ARE YOU ARE CRIED LIKE YOUR BILL BETTER. AND THEN LAST YEAR THAT'S COMING BACK TO YEAH THEY ARE THEY ALL ARE. WITH THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEWS OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND THE TIME AND WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE -- OF TALKING THROUGH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AROUND IT AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. PROBABLY IF WE HAVE MORE LENDER SELLS TO MORE CONVERSATIONS WILL PROBABLY COME UP WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS AS WELL BECAUSE WE PROBABLY NEED MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SO AS THANK YOU MONEY ONLY TODAY MOVING TO FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB THIRTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN [inaudible] THERE WAS [inaudible] WHENEVER MARIE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB THIRTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT FILE AS SOLE PROPRIETORS OR AS PARTNERSHIPS TO DEDUCT ORDINARY. AND NECESSARY BUSINESS EXPENSES FROM THE PERSONAL INCOME STATE TAXES. THE ABILITY TO DEDUCT EXPENSES INCURRED WHILE THE DUCTING BUSINESSES WHILE CONDUCTING BUSINESS IS ENJOYED BY ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES WHEN FILING TAXES. HOWEVER IRIS CODE SECTION TWO EIGHTY E. PROHIBITS NON CORPORATE ENTITIES THAT SALE ILLEGAL DRUGS FROM DEDUCTING THESE EXPENSES. CANNABIS WHILE LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA IS STILL UP FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. AS A RESULT CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT INCORPORATED ARE TAXED AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER LEGAL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. AB THIRTY SEVEN WITH A LINE OF CORPORATE AND THE PERSONAL TAX CODE TO ALLOW LEGAL CANVAS BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT LEGITIMATE OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. THIS BILL PROMOTE EQUITY AND AND THE SUCCESS OF LEGAL CAMPUS BUSINESSES BY REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN ON HIS NEW INDUSTRY. AB THIRTY SEVEN WILL HELP CAMPUS BUSINESSES IN THE LEGAL INDUSTRY AND OUT OF THE PREDOMINANT BLACK MARKET WITH ME TODAY I HAVE AMY JENKINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP -- AND AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS IMPORTANT BELL -- AGAIN AMY JENKINS I'M THE SENIOR POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I ALSO REPRESENT. A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL CANNABIS OPERATORS OF WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE AUTHOR. AS WELL AS MANY OF YOU -- TO TRY TO AND MEETS A COUPLE OBJECTIVES AND YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THESE A FEW TIMES BEFORE BUT FIRST IDENTIFY WAYS TO REDUCE TAX BURDENS ON EXISTING LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. KEEP LICENSE BUSINESSES IN OUR NEW REGULATED SYSTEM AND REDUCE BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO CALIFORNIA'S COMPLIANT CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. WE BELIEVE A. B. THIRTY SEVEN HELPS ME AND ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS -- WE BELIEVE IT WILL REDUCE ALYSSA OPERATIONS AS THE AUTHOR NOTED WE HAVE A VERY VERY THRIVING LICIT MARKET IN THE STATE. AND ANY AND EVERY OPTION THAT WE CAN CONTEMPLATE TO TRY TO REDUCE TAX BURDENS AND PROVIDE PATHWAYS -- FOR THIS INDUSTRY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED -- A. B. THIRTY SEVEN REDUCES AGAIN TAX BURDENS WE ARE SUBJECT TO A ARE COMPOUNDED BY LOCAL TAXES. SO AGAIN THE IDEA OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS THEIR AFFORDED TO OTHER BUSINESSES IS IMPORTANT WE ALSO BELIEVE AGAIN THIS THE SUPPORTS REGULATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IF A LOT OF UNLICENSED OPERATORS OUT THERE AGAIN PATHWAYS ARE IMPORTANT -- THIS INDUSTRY THE COMPLIANT INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO STRICT NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARDS. SO ANY AND ALL INCENTIVES ARE STRONGLY THESE REASONS THE SUPPORT DURING THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- I WOULD KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS AMONG SOME OF THE MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE INDUSTRY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPTION AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE F.
