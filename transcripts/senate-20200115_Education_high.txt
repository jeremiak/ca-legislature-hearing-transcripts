I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HIM MEMBERS- FOR BEING HERE EARLY BRIGHTON EARLY DAY YEAH I JUST WANT TO ISSUE A COUPLE OF THINGS- THOSE LETTERS THEY CAME MAN JUST THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THAT WAS JUST OVER THE WEEKEND AND WE I HAD SOMEBODY COULD TELL A STATE- DROPPED OFF SEVEN TO TEN THOUSAND LETTERS AT THE- EDUCATION. COMMITTEE YESTERDAY AND THEN THOSE BOXES OVER THERE. SO LET ME HELP ALL OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE YOU MUST BE NEW WE DO NOT A PLOTOR BLUE IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN GO LIKE THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING YOU GET TO STAY QUIET. SEVERAL PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU- AND IN THOSE BOXES OVER THERE WHAT WE DID IS WE WERE GOING TO PRINT OUT THE- FOR ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND PETITIONS. BUT BEING A CONSERVATIVE WE DIDN'T WANNA WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF- STATES MONEY SO- MY STAFF SPOKE TO THE PRINTING OFFICE AND THEY SAID- THAT'S HOW MANY BOXES IT WOULD. TAKE TO FILL THOSE ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND AND SO ANYWAY AS YOU CAN SEE- THAT THAT'S JUST A SMALL PORTION OF THE LETTERS WE HAD. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS SORT OF TOUCH MY HEART IF YOU LOOK TO THOSE THOUSANDS OF LETTERS THEY'RE NOT FORM LETTERS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAND READY TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE BECAUSE IT THIS GOES DEEPER YOU SEE. THE JUST THAT- YOU KNOW MONEY IT'S ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY'RE SUCH A VESTED INTEREST IN HERE AND WHY PEOPLE POURED THEIR HEART OUT. MOST THOSE WRITTEN TO ME BUT THEY WERE I TOOK SOME OF THE ZIP CODES. THAT YOU GUYS RAN AND- SO I KNOW I SOUND I THINK THREE THOUSAND LETTERS TO YOUR OFFICE SENATOR- THAT ZIP CODE SO ANYWAY GOOD MORNING CHAIR. IN MEMBERS- I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SAN SB SIX SEVENTY THREE ON BEHALF OF- THOUSANDS OF PARENTS WHO ARE OUR STATE- PETITION AGAIN I. PUT HOW MANY THERE WAS THERE BUT ALSO WE HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP THIS. CROSSED PARTY LINES. I GUESS KIDS WILL BE THAT. FOR CONCERNED PARENTS RIGHT AND ORGANIZATIONS- BUT OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CITIZENS- WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF I COULD GO ON BUT I JUST NAME THREE QUICKER- THIRTY HISPANIC CHURCHES HAVE SIGN ON. THE A LIST- ISLAMIC COUNCIL SEVEN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER SEVENTY MOSQUES. AS WELL AS OTHER MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS. ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE PEOPLE'S BILL AND- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE CATHOLIC SIGN ON WITH THEIR TEN MILLION- PARISHIONERS AND ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS REPRESENTING OTHER CHURCHES. ALSO I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT. OF THE SOUTHWEST SECTION OF THE AND DOUBLE ACP WHO SAYS WE SUPPORT. SB SEVENTY THREE BECAUSE IT CURRY- INCREASES PARENTAL OVERSIGHT. WITH AN OPT IN FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS- IT. THE CATHOLIC CONFERENCE ALSO SAYS WE ADVOCATE FOR THE HIGH QUALITY OF EDUCATION. FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS- IN DOING SO WE AFFIRM THE PARENTAL RIGHT. TO DIRECT AND BE FULLY ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. AND FROM THE ISLAMIC COUNCIL. THEY PUT AS YOUR CONSTITUENTS. CAL. HI VOTE SB SIX SEVENTY THREE SO THE ATTENTIONS OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT PRESCRIBED IN STATE LAW CAN BECOME REALITIES FOR GATE GRADES K. THROUGH SIX IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS ISSUE STRIKES A CHORD WITH PARENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO CARE DEEPLY FOR OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND WHO WANT TO BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND INFORMED ABOUT- INSTRUCTION IN OUR CLASSROOMS TO BE CLEAR SB SEVEN SIX SEVEN. THREE IS ABOUT OUR YOUNGEST STUDENTS ARE K. THROUGH SIXTH GRADE OUR FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADERS. AND BETWEEN- IT THIS BILL DOES THREE THINGS IT CREATES TRANSPARENCY. IN FULL DISCLOSURE. BY REQUIRING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE POST THE SIX CLASSES- CURRICULUM ONLINE MAKING AVAILABLE FOR PARENTS TO REVIEW WHAT A CONCEPT. IT ALSO ENSURES PARENTAL PARTICIPATION ON THE SENSITIVE TYPE TAKE A SPECIALLY TO ARGUE NO YOUNG FIRST SECOND THIRD GRADERS- BY REQUIRING AN ACTIVE- OPT IN POLICY- TO ANY SEX OUR CLASS LESSONS THAT THEY HAVE IN REQUIRES A SEXUAL HEALTH AND HIV PREVENTION CURRICULA TO BE AGE APPROPRIATE. IN MEN PARTS OF STATES PARENTS HAVE BEEN STONE WALL WORDS HAVE GOTTEN QUITE A BIT A- PHONE CALLS ON THIS AND EXAMPLES BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS- FOR SOME REASON THEY THEY DON'T WANT FULL DISCLOSURE AND THAT'S NOT MY WORDS THOSE ARE CALLS AND LETTERS OF WE'VE HAD COME IN AND SO THAT ALWAYS GVES THE APPEARANCE. OF HIDING SOMETHING BUT ALSO I JUSTWANT TO THANK A COUPLE THINGS- THE ACLU SAYS PERCENT IN IN A OPPOSITION LETTER TO ME BOB AND THE REASON I JUST WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE THINGS FROM IT IS A SAY THAT THIS BILL RUNS COUNTER TO THE BEST BEST BUSINESS PRACTICES. AND IT'S KIND OF FUNNY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY CITE A STUDY FROM THE RAND INSTITUTE FROM OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO. THAT THEY THINK THE BEST WAY. TO GIVE PEOPLE NOTICES THROUGH MAIL BUT YOU KNOW SINCE THE LAST THIRTY ONE YEARS WE NOW HAVE WE'VE BEEN ADVANCE IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SO MAYBE THEY SHOULD COME UP TO SPEED WITH THEIR BETTER BUSINESS PRACTICES BOB AND SO WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE WE HAD EMAIL SALES TAX- WHATEVER YOU YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE PERRANCE. AND SO THAT WAS KIND OF A WEIRD THING THEY SAID BUT WHAT IS WORSE ABOUT THE STUDY THAT THEY SITE FROM THE RAND INSTITUTE IS THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS TO SEVENTH GRADE CLASSES IN LA. SOMY- STAFF DID RESEARCH AND WE FOUND OUT THERE'S TEN THOUSAND. FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE SCHOOLS IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND BACK THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO THEY ONLY SAMPLE TO. A CLASSROOM SO THAT WAS THE ACLU'S LETTER AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING A CASE. PHAM CONNECTS I'D LIKE TO READ ONE AND THIS IS KIND OF A SAD WHEN I'M I CAN READ THE WHOLE THING. BUT I'M I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED- I LOVE TEACHERS. YOU KNOW THAT SEVEN YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL I GOT TO KNOW MY TEACHERS PRETTY WELL- BUT THE FEDERAL CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. SAN IN A LETTER OPPOSING TO AN AND THIS THIS THIS IS PROBABLY MORE ON A SERIOUS NOTE. BECAUSE WHAT THEY SAY THEY SORT OF MAKE OUR CASE. THIS OPPOSITION LEADER WARREN OPPOSITION TO SAID SIX SEVENTY THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE FOR A PUPIL IN ACTIVE PARENTAL CONSENT. WITH A SIGNATURE. FOR SEXUAL EDUCATION. SO THEY DON'T WANT THE PARENTS TO SIGN IN IT JUST KIND OF WHATEVER BUT IT ALSO SAYS. THIS BILL REQUIRES A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE THOSE MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION. BEFORE THE DATE OF INSTRUCTION. AND SO AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THEY WOULD WANNA WANNA HIDE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT BUT WORSE THAN THAT THEY PUT IN THIS LETTER AND AGAIN HIT IT'S SORT OF- THE I THINK IS BAD BECAUSE ARM. AT ONE TIME THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS AND I AND I STILL BELIEVE THEY BELIEVE THAT PROBABLY THE MAJORITY THE TEACHERS BUT THIS LETTER. SORT O INCRIMINATES HIM- ON THIS BILL SAYS IT ALLOWS PARENTS TO REVIEW THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE AGAINST THIS RIGHT THIS OFTEN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PARENTS TO REVIEW THE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE POSTED ON THE DISTRICT'S WEBSITE. INCLUDING TEACHERS LESSON PLANS AND SCRIPTS THERE'S MORE TO THIS LETTER. BUT I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD ENOUGH AND YOU GET THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. BUT ANYWAY- FEDERATION OF TEACHERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH STEP. POSTED A I THINK OUR ARGUMENT- IN IT TOOK US ONE MOTHER BY THE WAY AND SHE'S HERE TODAY JUST IN CASE IT NOT. TO TESTIFY BUT JUST IN CASE OF ANYBODY ON THE- DíAS WOULD LIKE TO ASK HER QUESTIONS- IN THE EAST BAY ONE MONTH. AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. WHO PRESTON HER SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND OFFICIALS. AND IT TOOK OVER ONE MONTH BEFORE SHE WAS GIVEN PERMISSION. TO GO DOWN TO THE SCHOOL AND THEN AT THAT TIME THEY ONLY GAVE OUR HALF HOUR TO REVIEW HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF MATERIAL. AND SO THIS IS WRONG PARENTS SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY DECISION. MAKERS AND WHEN AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE INTRODUCED TO SENSITIVE MATERIAL. NOT OF COURSE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS HOPEFULLY WE ALL BELIEVE THAT. AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT EVERYTHING. OUT IN THE OPEN AND BY THE WAY. POLICY THAT FOR LATER I AM AWARE THAT SOME OPPOSITION TO THE BILL CENTERS AROUND AN ACTIVE OPT IN POLICY. BUT THIS IS WHAT FAMILIES ONE. AND THAT'S WHAT SB SIX SEVENTY THREE DOES SIMPLY IS LIKE A PERMISSION SLIP. AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE A FIELD TRIP. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERMISSION SLIP RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE SUBJECTS WERE NOT DOING THIS FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND YET. AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO CUT THIS IS THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE CUTTING PARENTS OUT OF THE LOOP IN EDUCATION. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE- RESEARCH SHOWS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN PARENTS ARE INVOLVED. WHETHER IT'S MATH SCIENCE AND LITERATURE. OR SPORTS THEIR CHILDREN ALWAYS PERFORM BETTER SO WE SHOULD GIVE PARENTS FULL ACCESS FULL DISCLOSURE SO IF PERMISSION SLIPS ARE REQUIRED FOR MUSEUM TRIP OR A FIELD TRIP- BECAUSE WE NEED THE RELEASE OF LIABILITY TO INFORM THE PARENTS WHERE AND WHENTHEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE- THE WANT TO TRIP SURELY WE CAN ASK THE SAME FOR SEX. FOR THE SIX CLASSES AGAIN FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS FIRST SECOND THIRD THROUGH SIXTH GRADERS- IT'S A TOPIC THAT NEEDS PARENTAL PARTICIPATION- SIX SEVENTY THREE ENHANCES SUPPORT FOR PARENTS AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT PARENTS NOT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY FOR PARENTS WHILE INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND SS ABILITY THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT ME YOU'LL HEAR FROM A NUMBER PARENTS AND FAMILIES FOR THE TRAVEL ACROSS OUR STATE TO BE HERE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND WANT TO THANK THEM FOR MAKING THIS TRIP ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS TODAY. FOR BE INHERENT LISTENING TO THIS BILL WHAT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT BUT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME LAST YEAR I BOWED BUT HERE TO TODAY I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF SPEAKERSTEAM BROYLES WHO'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE NATIONAL CENTER WHAT I'LL SEE AN A DOCTOR SOBEL WHO I JUST MET BUT I TALKED TO HIM NUMEROUS TIMES ON THE PHONE AND I WE HAVE KINDRED SPIRITS HE SAID. THE ISLAMIC COUNCIL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU SEVERAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE USUALLY TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. PERCENT. GOOD I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WHAT I SAID. WHICH I PROBABLY DIDN'T MAKE CLEAR START IS WE'VE GOT TO WITNESSES RIGHT HERE SO THEY'RE GOING TO WITNESS BUT WHAT I HAD MENTIONED IN CASE OF ANYBODY UP ON A DíAS DID HAVE A QUESTION FROM A CONCERNED PARENT- BECAUSE DENISE'S SOMEONE IS SORT OF GOT THIS BILL STARTED WAS HER IDEA SHE FROM THE BAY AREA SO IF YOU DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR. SHE WOULD BE HERE MY MOM THAT YOU PERFECT SO TO WITNESS TWO MINUTES EACH ALL YOU DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST. GOOD MORNING. I'M HERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY. HUSBAND OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND FATHER OF THREE TEENS IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SEVENTY THREE. US SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY AFFIRMED THE PARENTS HAVE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. TO DIRECT THE CARE AND RAISING THEIR CHILDREN NOT TO STATE. FAMILIES DO NOT LOSE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE GATE. CALIFORNIA'S YOU YOU THE% ACKNOWLEDGES PARENTAL RIGHTS BY PERMITTING BUT NOT REQUIRING THE CSE INSTRUCTION BE GIVEN K. THROUGH SIX GRADES. THE PROVIDES FAMILIES OF THE OUR ABILITY TO OPT OUT NGUYEN CSE IS TAUGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND REQUIRES YOU SEE MUST BE AGE APPROPRIATE MEDICALLY ACCURATE. SB SIX SEVENTY THREE FURTHER ENSURE THE PARENTAL RIGHTS ARE FULLY RESPECTED IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST TRANSPARENCY SEE SEE TRANSPARENCY IS CURRENTLY A REAL PROBLEM BY ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS FROM FAMILIES FACING SIGNIFICANT BERRIES AND ASSESSING AND REVIEWING SEXUAL HEALTH CURRICULUM. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA IF YOU TAX IF TO SCHOOL IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DECIDES TO TEACH SEXUALITY HEALTH CURRICULUM. YOUNGER CHILDREN K. TO SIXTH GRADE SB SIX SEVENTY THREE REQUIRES THEM TO MAKE THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AT A LEVEL. SITES IN LANGUAGES IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CAN UNDERSTAND. CONSENT REQUIRES THAT PARENTS ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED. THIS BILL REMEDIES THIS DEFICIENCY SECOND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CHOICE COUPLED WITH TRANSPARENCY IN ACTIVE OP IN IS A MUCH BETTER SAFEGUARD OF CIVIL RIGHTS. INCLUDING PRANA RIGHTS IN THE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE APPLYING THE PASSIVE OPT OUT HERE WOULD MEAN THAT VERY YOUNG CHILDREN MAY BE SUBJECTED TO SEE A SCENE MATERIALS AGAINST THEIR PARENTS ACTUAL WISHES. SB SIX SEVENTY THREE MAKES CALIFORNIA WHO HELP THE ATTACK MORE CULTURALLY AND RELIGIOUSLY SENSITIVE AND IS BETTER RESPECT CIVIL RIGHTS. AND THE CORE LIBERAL VALUES OF TOLERANCE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIRED TO INFORM PARENTS ACTUALLY GIVE CONSENT. SIGNIFICANTLY THE RESEARCH CITED BY THE ACLU AND MOST OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT OPT OUT IS PREFERRED BY PARENTS. NOR THAT VERY EARLY SEXUALITY EDUCATION IS IN THE BEST ITERESTS OF CHILDREN. THE OPPOSITION RESEARCH ACTUALLY SUPPORTS SB SIX SEVENTY THREE THE RAND STUDY IS POINTED OUT STRONG SUPPORT ON FORMED SENT HERE CONSPIRACY AND OFTEN. CSE STARTING IN FIFTH GRADE AT THE EARLIEST NOT KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE WITHOUT THESE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS OF TRANSPARENCY. ACCOUNTABILITY AND CHOICE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE MORE VULNERABLE TO FINANCIALLY CRIPPLING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUITS FROM FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THESE EARLY SEXUALITY PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. A GOOD MORNING TO RESPECT IT SENATORS MY NAME IS DOCTOR I'M IS SO ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS LONG MAKE SURE COUNCIL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION OF SEVENTY FIVE ORGANIZATIONSREPRESENTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS I'M ALSO THE REGISTER TO THE CHINO VALLEY STOMACH CENTER IN THE CITY OF CHINO I'M A DENTIST ON FATHER I'M A CONCERNED CITIZEN AS WELL. I'M SURE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT THE FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS NOT IS TOO COLD BUT I'M SURE HE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING EVERY MAJOR YOU CAN IN EVERY. EFFORT YOU CAN'T TO. DO THE BEST AND CHOOSE THE BEST DECISION TO PICK THE BEST CONCLUSIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATES REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER. WE ARE A DIVERSE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURES DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES BUT WE ALL AGREE ON ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING. WE AGREE WITH ALL THE PARENTS IN THE WAR HAT WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN. WE LOVE THEM TREMENDOUSLY. SOME ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE GENUINE REQUEST AND THEY MOTION PLEASE APPEARANCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE PARENTS ARE CONCERNED THE SPIRITS ARE AFRAID. THESE PARENTS ARE WORRIED FOR THE MOST VALLEY LASSES THE HACK WHICH IS THEIR CHILDREN. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A NATION THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS INCLUDING THE RIGHTS OF THE PARENTS. ONE OF THESE. THE EACH FATHER MOTHER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. SOMETHING NOT ONLY BENEFITS CHILDREN. BUT ALSO THE SITE YET LARGE. THE CRISIS WE HAVE IN THE WAY AWARE YOUTH AND YOUNG STARS ARE ACTING. IS VERY SERIOUS AND VERY CONCERNING. THESE ARE OUR FUTURE SENATORS FUTURE LEADERS AND FUTURE PRESIDENTS. THE MORE WE STRIP AWAY RIGHTS FROM PARENTS. THE STILLER SUFFER AND OUR NATION AS WELL. AMERICAN LISTEN TO JOIN. HANDS VERY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. FOR THE MOST FROM BEING A- PLACE IN SCHOOL. WE ARE ALL FOR CREATING MET. TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. BUT THE MEASURES WE TAKE HAVE TO BE BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION RIGHTS. SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND FAMILY VALUES. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT INCREASES PARENTAL OVERSIGHT. WITH AN OPT IN FOR OUR KIDS AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. AT MY DENTAL OFFICE WHICH IS BY THE WAY IN THE SAME BUILDING AS- SENATOR LEVERS OFFICE IN POMONA. OF TO COME OVER AND SAY HELLO. I CANNOT CLEAN KIDS TEETH WITHOUT A VERY DETAILED CONSENT SIGNED BY ONE OF THE PARENTS EVEN IF I HAVE TO PROVIDE WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. I'M SURE CLEANING THE TEETH OF A TEN YEAR OLD BOY OR GIRL IS MUCH LESS SERIOUS THAN TEACH THEM ABOUT SEXUALITY. WHEN YOU VOTE ON THIS BILL PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MORE WE ONLY MAKE PARENTS THE MORE WE'LL SEE EXODUS FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. INTO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND INDEPENDENT SCHOOLING WHICH IN TURN WILL HURT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE I SURE THE VOICES OF THE MOST OF COMMITTEES OF CALIFORNIA AT LARGE NORTH AND SOUTH AND CENTRAL. AND ALSO THE VOICES OF EVERY CONCERNED PARENT. WHO IS NOT ABLE TO SHARE HIS OR HER VOICE TO YOU AT THIS CRUCIAL HEARING. AS YOU CONSTITUENTS THEY ARE ALL SAYING PLEASE SUPPORT OUR PARENTAL RIGHTS AND VOTE I TODAY THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND FOR BEING TRUST WITH THE PUBLIC SERVANTS.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OKAY WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR CHIANG. THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM CHAIR. ARM OR WE ALLOWED TO BRING BACK A CENTER MORALS WITNESS ATTORNEY DEAN FOR YOU YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY. OKAY. YOUR SO MR BROYLES CAN YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO THE RESEARCH CITED BY THE ACLU THAT APPEAR TO SHOW THAT AN OPT OUT APPROACH IS MORE LINED UP WITH THE INTENTIONS OF PARENTS AS COMPARED TO AN OPT IN. ON. THREE SEVEN ON. YEAH IT IS A TESTIFIED EARLIER- BRIEFLY- THE RAND RESEARCH STUDY IS WHAT'S RELIED ON NOT ON ONLY BY THE ACLU BUT IT'S REPEATED BY 80% OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS. CITED AS A TO SUCH A DECISIVE UP POINT THAT PARENTS PREFER OPT OPT. OUT RATHER THAN OPT IN. ABOUT FOUR AND FORTUNATELY THE RAIN RESEARCH IS NOT SUPPORT THE POSITION. THAT OPT OUT PASSIVE CONSENT MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS PARENTS' WISHES REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE SEXUALITY EDUCATION. I'VE GOT A COPY THE RAND STUDY HERE IN AND ACTUALLY WAS- LIMITED STUDY OF TWO SCHOOLS- END OF SEVENTH GRADE CLASSES IN TWO SCHOOLS. INITIALLY THERE WAS NOT COMPREHENSIVE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IT WAS STUDIED IN FACT IT WAS- A DREAD REHABILITATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY NOT QUERIED AS TO WHAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS AS FAR AS AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT. OF THE ROOM THE RAND RESEARCH TEAM- DEDUCED FROM THE RESPONSE RATES FROM AN OPT OUT IN ONE SCHOOL IN AN OPT IN IN A SCHOOL WHAT'S PARENTS WISHES WERE BUT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY QUERY THE PARENTS ON WHAT THEIR PREFERENCE WAS. IT BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD. IS A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD STUDY IT WAS A LIMITED POOL. OF SCHOOLS AND WASN'T TALKING ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE SEXUALITY EDUCATION WHETHER PARENTS PREFERRED AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT ESPECIALLY. FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN. AND SO THE STUDY ITSELF IS. IT IT IT'S NOT EVEN A STUDY OF OPT IN OPT OUT IN THE SEXUALITY EDUCATION A SPHERE NOR IS IT A STUDY- INVOLVING AND HER CHILDREN. AND SO THIS EVEN LOOK AT THE STUDY YOURSELF I ENCOURAGE THE SENATORS TO DO SO AND I'VE GOT A COPY THE CITY HERE IF ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE IT- BUT THEY SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT PARENTAL RIGHTS. WHAT PRINT PRINT PARENTS PREFERRED AS FAR AS AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT. BUT A COUPLE POINT SOMEONE A QUOTE FROM THE STUDY ITSELF. THERE THERE THERE WAS TWO TWO POINTS ON PAGE FOR THE STUDY VOTE. THIS EXTREMELY SMALL POOL IS NOT GENERALIZE GENERALIZABLE TO ALL SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS SHE CAN'T TAKE THAT ONE STUDY THAT HAD DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING DO WITH SIX SAID AND SAY WHAT AT APPLIES TO ANY OTHER SCHOOL LET ALONE REGARDING SEXUALITY EDUCATION SECONDLY THE SITE THE RAND STUDY SAYS QUOTE. DECIDING WHETHER PASSIVE OR ACTIVE CONSENT IS APPROPRIATE MUST BE DECIDED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY IS TO SAY YOU KNOW AN OPT OUT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR SEVENTH THROUGH TWELFTH GRADERS BUT AN OPT IN WITH MORE PARENTAL BUT IN CONTROL IS THE PRO. FOR YOUR STUDENTS AND FINALLY WHAT I. USE AN OPT IN OR OUT OPT OUT APPROACH THE KEY ISSUE IS INFORMED CONSENT. THE PARENTS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY NEED TO BE INFORMED OF WHAT THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DECIDE UPON IN OTHER WORDS HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS ACCESS TO THE CREEK ON TRANSPARENCY IS THE KEY ISSUE OF THIS BILL BUT SECONDLY- THEY NEED TO- ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM. AND THE BEST WAY TO FORCE PICKED HER PARENTS TO GIVE ACTIVE CONSENT INFORMED CONSENT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRE THAT. URGE THE PARENTS TO LOOK AT THE MATERIALS AND THAT'S WHAT AN OP PRECISELY WITHIN OFTEN DOES. NOT BEEN SAYS HEY YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTIVELY. DECIDING PROACTIVELY TO. PUT YOUR CHILD IN THIS PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE IS JOHN IS FIVE YEARS OLD- THE AGE GROUP WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT YOUNG ADULTS ARE LITTLE LITTLE ADULTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN- TO TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN. AND SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ACTUAL INFORMED CONSENT. WE NEED TO HAVE AN OPT IN AND WE NEED THE TRANSPARENCY INVOLVED. OTHERWISE THERE'S A VERY BIG DANGER THAT CHILDREN WILL BE SUBJECTED TO EARLY SEXUALITY EDUCATION WHEN THEIR PARENTS ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM OR DON'T DON'T AT CONSENT TO THEIR INVOLVEMENT. SENATE CHANGE OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU KNOW I AM JUST A MINUTE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I AM A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POINTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I TRULY SEE THIS AS A PARENTAL RIGHTS ISSUE AND A- A TRANSPARENCY ISSUE AND I WILL ALWAYS SIDE WITH PARENTAL RIGHTS AND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU SO I'LL BE VOTING AYE ON THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WILL YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST WAS FOR. MISS SMART WITH A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. FIRST I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE TESTIMONY EVERYBODY COMING TODAY YOU ARE VERY WELL BEHAVED SO I SALUTE YOU FOR THAT- SO. PTA SO THAT THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. BUT THEY DO SUPPORT THE TRANSPARENCY PORTION AS RELATES TO POSTING ON THE WEBSITE I WAS CURIOUS IF YOUR ORGANIZATION SHARES THAT VIEW. A SO IT'S OUR POSITION THAT THE INSPECTION AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA THESE ACTOR ALREADY ROBUST- AND THAT CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR THAT INSPECTION SO. I THINK WE VERY A LITTLE BIT ON THAT POINT OKAY THANK YOU SO DOT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL SOSHE JUST SAID THAT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT HOUSE APPROPRIATE CARS FOR PARENTAL RIGHTS CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS BILL. MAKES IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT. THAT IS SIMPLY CATEGORICALLY NOT TRUE THE ACT ITSELF IS VERY VAGUE AS FAR AS HOW PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE INFORMED ABOUT- THE SEXUALITY EDUCATION AT THEIR SEVENTY TWELFTH GRADERS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE AN OLDER GRADES AND LIKE I SAID IN AN- CENTER MORALES RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF LETTERS. MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS ALL OVER THE STATE. WHO HAD THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. GIVE BRAG GIVE BARRIERS AND SO IT IT SURPRISES ME THAT ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION WOULD ACTUALLY- DISFAVOR PARENTS DID TO THE THEY'RE THE ONES. THIS THIS CURRICULUM IS ACTUALLY BEING HIDDEN FROM PARENTS AND CONCEALED FROM PARENTS FUND FOR A MAKES INFORMED CONSENT IMPOSSIBLE THIS IS BILL AND IT IMPROVE IT. WELL IT AS AS AS I STATED EARLIER IT'S IT MAKES US GO TO SIX PUT ALL THE MATERIALS ON THE WEBSITE. IN IN IN LANGUAGES THAT IMMIGRANTS WILL UNDERSTAND AND IN ENGLISH AND OTHER LANGUAGES THAT ARE APPLE ON IN EACH DISTRICT. SECONDLY IT REQUIRES AN OPT IN SO IT RATHER THAN PARENTS JUST IGNORING A NOTICE AND NOT SIGNING THEIR PARENTS OUT OF THE PROGRAM IT REQUIRES PARENTS ACTUALLY DECIDE PROACTIVELY THAT THEIR CHILD IS THAT THE MATERIAL IS AGE APPROPRIATE MEDICALLY ACCURATE ENOUGH FOR THEIR CHILD. AND SO IT'S AN ACTIVE CONSENT- IT'S AN INFORMED CONSENT AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA IN THE OLDER GRADES IS NOT INFORMED CONSENT IT'S CONCEALED- IT'S ACTUALLY. A LOT OF THE HAPPENINGS ACTUALLY DECEPTIVE AND GREAT WHITE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. HAVING SAID THAT I WHAT I SEE A LOT OF NEW FACES HERE TODAY I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE YOU NEED TO STAY ENGAGED. IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS BUILDING. WE ARE HAVING OUR OWN PRIVATE VERSION AT ANIMAL FARM POLICY MAKERS. IN THIS BUILDING WANT TO RAISE YOUR CHILDREN WHEN IT COMES TO A CHOI AT SCHOOL CHOICE COMES TO HAVING INPUT ON CURRICULUM- WE WERE PUT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS IN BETWEEN DOCTORS AND PARENTS AND CHILDREN ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING ON. AND SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY YOU HAVE TO STAY ENGAGED OR YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE BILL WOULD BE TO RAISE YOUR OWN CHILDREN CAN I JUST ADD SOMETHING QUICKLY DON'T KNOW. YOU MAY NOT. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PAN. THANK YOU EXCERPTED MENU WHICH NAME AGAIN SIR SAREEN BROYLES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PRESS AYE- APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY UP BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND MAYBE THERE'S A QUESTION STAFF CAN HELP WITH- THIS ROSE CONCERT REFER TO SEXUALITY EDUCATION I AM NOT SURE I SEE THAT IN THE CODE THAT WE HAVE SEXUALITY EDUCATION I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS EDUCATION STANDARDS AROUND- SEXUAL HEALTH H. I. MENTIONED BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN. YEAH HI I'M JUST I JUST BE CLEAR. SO YOU ARE CORRECT IS ABOUT SEX EDUCATION OKAY HEALTH EDUCATE- WELL MAYBE A SUBTLE DISTINCTION I THINK LET'S LET'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ONE SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN MORE ACTUALLY REPRESENT WHAT THE CODE ACTUALLY SAYS- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- CERTAINLY- SO MORALE AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THE I. BUT AND I'VE WELCOME IN FACT- THE PTA SO ALSO STAND SUPPORT OF- BE SURE THAT WE HAVE- TRANSPARENCY ON THE CURRICULUM MATERIALS- BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE WITNESS IS PRO ACTUALLY SAID PART OF THE PURPOSES BILLS TO FORCE PARENTS. AND YET THIS IS BEING FRAMED AS A PARENTAL RIGHTS- BUT YET THE TESTIMONY WAS ABOUT FORCING PARENTS. SO I'M A LITTLE DISTURBED ABOUT THAT AS WELL- AND- YEAH AGAIN I THINK CERTAINLY PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO. REVIEW THE CURRICULA AND CHOOSE TO OPT HER CHILD OUT. THEIR OWN CHILDREN BUT AGAIN. YOU KNOW THIS IS PART OF THE CURRICULUM AND I GUESS THE OTHER AND IN FACT- ANY SORT OF CURRICULA THAT'S TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE IT'S ALSO. COUNTY AND WE HAVE SCHOOL BOARDS THAT MAKE DECISIONS AS WELL AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO REVIEW CURRICULA THAT'S BEING TIGHTENED AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WAY AND WITH THE PARTICULAR SCHOOL BOARD. I WITHIN THE STATE STATE STANDARDS. THERE IS ARE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES ACTUALLY NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC VETTING OF- THE OF STANDARDS BOTH NOW AT SEA LEVEL BUT ALSO MORE SPECIFICALLY AT THE SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL COULD CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. AND PERHAPS ALSO THAT HE- CAN I COMMENT ON YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF MY TESTIMONY BUT I AM JUST QUOTE AT NO YOU'RE MISREPRESENTING WHEN I SAID. I SAID THAT. TRANSPARENCY AND- AND AN PT IN IS MORE LIKELY TO MAKE MAKE SURE THE PARENTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE CURRICULUM TO MAKE A DECISION. MY IT IF I USE THE WORD FORCING IT WAS IT WAS NOT I'M NOT TRYING TO HOLD A GUN TO PARENTS HEADS. I JUST THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND CHOICE IN FULL DISCLOSURE FOR THE PARENTS ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION AND NOT THE STATE FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. WHO IS YOUR QUESTION. ACTUALLY WAS FIRST- ASKING THE AUTHOR AND THEN PERHAPS ALSO. THE PTA PERHAPS ALSO COMMENT ON THE LEVEL OF- REVIEWER FOR RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTAL AND PUT IN CURRICULA. GENERAL HELLO AGAIN. BUT LET ME EXPLAIN THE OPT OUT. THE OPT OUT. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS CENTER PAN A QUESTION MY QUESTION WAS THE OPPORTUNITY DEPUTIES FOR PARENTAL INPUT- POST AT THE STATE LEVEL OF THE SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL AND OF COURSE I THINK WE ALL HOPEFULLY WE ALL AGREED THAT- PARENTS THIS THING WHILE ARE ALLOWED TO. OPT THEIR OWN CHILDREN OUT. EXPLAINING IS. WHAT A SO IT PEOPLE CAN MOVE YOU CAN MISS THE MAIL THAT'S WHY THE OPT IN YOU KNOW IT'S PARENTAL PARTICIPATION BUT A REVIEW THE MATERIAL AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP YOU DON'T NEED TO ROLL YOUR EYES BY THE WAY BUT- ANYWAY. SO AND MORALE. ISN'T LOOKING AT YOU I WAS LOOKING AT DOCTOR PAN PLEASE PROCEED. SO ANYWAY THEY OFTEN THE OPT OUTS PASSIVE THE OPT IN IS AN ACTIVE ONE BECAUSE AGAIN WE WANT THE PARENTS FEEL OF REVIEW THE ENTIRE MATERIAL BUT WE WANT PARENTS HAVE ACCESS WE WANT PARENTS BE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION SPECIAL HANNAH SUBJECT CONSENT OF SAS BECAUSE SOMETHING'S I THINK GET MISCONSTRUED OUR FRIEND HERE FROM THE OF WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT STUDY CHAU PREGNANCIES DOWN THAT'S ATTACKER BUT WE'RE ALL. OF FIRST SECOND YEARS RIGHT YEAH YEAH THAT'S SO YOUNG MAY BE STARTING A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT BUT- AND- I THINK THIS CENSUS. A SENSITIVE MATERIAL WE WANT TO PAY. AND WE THINK IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO THAT WEBSITE AND THEN AT THAT POINT IN TIME THEY CAN SIGN YOUR KID UP IF THEY THINK THE DATA IS AGE APPROPRIATE FORM. OKAY TWELVE WHAT'S MORE OF AN ACTIVE THING ON THE PARENTS PART. LOOK FOR ACTION SORRY. OKAY THANK YOU HAVE CENTER PAN WRAPS THE PTA ALSO ANSWER THE QUESTION MORE SPECIFICALLY ASKED WAS ABOUT THE OPTIONS FOR PARENTAL INPUT. AT BOTH THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE- STATE LEVEL PUT MORE PERHAPS MORE SPECIFICALLY ON SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL. THE. THANK YOU. THE PTA VALUES- PARENT PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT IN FACT WE COSPONSORED A BILL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THAT CHANGED AT GO TO MAKE SURE. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENCOURAGE AND- FACILITATE PARENTS ENGAGEMENT IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT'S PART OF THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RENTAL OF FAMILY ENGAGEMENT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THERE AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANT WE WANT PARENTS AND FAMILIES TO FEEL. LIKE THEY HAVE SOME VOICE IT IS. IN THEIR COMMUNITY PTA KNOWS THAT WE HAVE A PLURALISTIC SO EIGHTY THAT MEANS WE HAVE PEOPLE OF ALL RELIGIONS WE HAVE PEOPLE OF ALL ETHNICITIES. ALL POLICE SYSTEMS CALIFORNIA PTA IS ALL CHILDREN WE HAVE A GROUP. FOR PARENTS AND FAMILIES TO ULTIMATELY HAVE THAT HE'S AND IT IS A GLOBAL AT THE SCHOOL. THANK YOU SIR NEED. OKAY I HAVE I APPRECIATE TO AND I SHARE YOUR DESIRE TO HAVE MORE PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT- AND I THINK AND YOU'RE RIGHT- FRONTAL ENGAGEMENTS- USUALLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TEACHERS AND- AGAIN ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS- HELP AND- FOR- PERFORMANCE OF OUR OF STUDENTS OF PARTICULARLY PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN YEAH AND THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE VALUE ON WHICH TO HAPPEN- I THINK- YEAH MIGHT IN TURN. THAT WHAT DO HAVE MULTIPLE MECHANISMS FOR PEOPLE TO BOTH BE ENGAGED IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CURRICULA. WE JUST HEARD. CERTAINLY WE CREATE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY- FOR PARENTS FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO OPT OUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT- BY CREATING AN OPT IN WE'RE ACTUALLY DENYING- SOME CHILDREN TO- MAY NOT AND FORTUNATELY HAVE A FAMILY SITUATION OR SOCIAL SITUATION THAT MAKES IT- AS IS POSSIBLE FOR THOSE FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO- TO BE ES DID TO ACTUALLY MAY LOSE OUT ON AN FOR IT POURTANT. THEIR EDUCATION AND WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS ACTUALLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY. THE WAY AND THAT AND AGAIN I WOULD FIND YOU THAT THE ACTION I WAS TO SAY IS THAT THE OVERALL CURRICULA IS SOMETHING THAT DOES GO THROUGH A YOU KNOW OF A PUBLIC PROCESS BOTH AT THE STATE THE STANDS ARE SET STATE AND ALSO THE SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL SO. THAT MEANS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE THIS IS A STANDARD THAT WE- THE WHOLE. AND CERTAINLY IF PARENTS WISH THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF CERTAIN PIECES OF THAT- UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT I THINK THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ACTIVE DECISION. TO OPT OUT THAT SINCE WE'VE COMMUNITY COLLECTIVELY OF SAID THIS IS SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT PARTS ON EDUCATION. THE CHAU CHILDREN SHOULD BE A FAILED OF THAT UNLESS. SAID THAT THIRTY DAY FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN I DISAGREE SO- ITH THAT AND FOR SHALL NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT BILL TONIGHT. OUR FINAL QUESTION SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES. OKAY SO WHAT I SEE THE OP ART. THE HOUSE AND THE PAIR MAY NOT MAIL IT BACK SO THIS. THE EDUCATION BUT WHAT IF THEY MOVE WHAT IF THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE MAIL- THAT IS GOING TO BE FEWER PARTICIPANTS BUT THE OFTEN AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY PARENT WILL HAVE TO. DECIDE TO DO SO I'M I'M LOSING YOU A LITTLE BIT DIRECT NATION SORT OF CUTS BOTH WAYS NOW ALSO. BUT THE FOR SEE DOCTOR AND- USUALLY THE OTHERS SO I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS. WHERE WE ENGAGED THE PUBLIC AND PARENTS AND I. GUIDE SCHOOL BOARD YOU SEE A LOT OF PARENTS THERE- SHOW UP AND SO THE SCHOOL BOARD. ESTABLISHES CURRICULA OUT AT HAS TO PROVE CURRICULA YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE TEACHERS WE ARE AT THE STATE WE HAVE A VERY PUBLIC PROCESS AS PUBLIC NOTICE THE ONLY OF NOTICES GO OUT CETERA. AND SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE TO REVIEW AND CURRICULA SO IN PROCESS WHICH WE- DO THROUGH THE MARKETS THE RIGHT. PART NUMBER RIGHT WE- WE HAVE TO OUR ELECTED TO LEGISLATURE LIKE YOU AND I. DO AND WE HAVE. SO THOSE ESTABLISH A SENSE LEADER AND COMMUNITY STANDARDS FOR THAT. BE DEFERRED OFTEN VERY MUCH TO LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS SO AGAIN THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE AT STATE BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY IN SCHOOL ESTABLISH WHAT ARE THE EDUCATIONAL. CURRICULA AND STANDARDS WE WISH TO TEACH AND A PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A BIZARRE- THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY STANDARD PAT. THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CURRICULUM- THIS THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT WE ALSO PROVIDE. IF YOU CHOOSE TO SAY WHY DON'T AGREE WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. AND I DON'T WANT MY CHILD THIS PARTICULAR PORTION EDUCATION WE GIVE PEOPLE THE OPRY THE OPT OUT BUT SAYS THAT BECAUSE WE'VE GONE THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO PUBLISH THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE STANDARD. CURRICULUM IN EDUCATION. STUDENT IN THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IN THE STATE RIGHT AT THE WHAT THE VAN THAT SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT. RATE THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE GET. UNLESS YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I THE ONLY BE AND I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TAKE OF THIS PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE EDUCATION. THAT IS THAT'S AN OPT OUT. BLOOM IS OTHER AROUND THE SAME THE EVEN THOUGH WE AS A COMMUNITY FOR. ALL THE REASONS THAT WE'VE DECIDED THAT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STATION. ESTABLISHED CREEK. THAT UNLESS YOU SEE THAT IF YOU DO OPT IN THAT MEANS IN. WHO AT SOME OF THE SET ISN'T USED. OUT THE THING IN. LATE WILL BE DENIED AN EDUCATION THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY THINK THAT EVERY CHILD. OUT YOU KNOW OF COURSE RECOGNIZING THAT PARENTS THEMSELVES CAN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TO GET THAT PART BECAUSE I HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION THAN THE GENERAL UNITY. WE IN THE OPPORTUNITY BUT IF WE DO. BUT OTHERWISE I WOULD SAY IS THAT. THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE THAT WE WENT THROUGH. HELLO YES WE HAD A LOT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD. PROCESS TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE CURRICULUM SHOULD BE THAT EVERY CHILD GETS. SHOULD AT THE PARENT HAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION DATE OF THE OPERATING ROOM TROUT THAT. WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING. MY CHECK NO PORTION THE EDUCATION THAT IS. LIKE THE GENERAL EDUCATION THEY CAN ALSO GO ARGUE WITH SCHOOL BOARD ABOUT WELL WE DON'T WANT CHAGE THE CONTENT I'M NOT YOU KNOW I HAVE A CONCERN THAT OTHER CHILDREN HAVE ANY SOMETHING THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH. HELLO TALK TO THE SCHOOL BOARD YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SCHOOL WHICH ALSO BY THE WAY HAS ELECTED MEMBERS ON THAT BOARD IBM THAT'S- LIKE THE ICING. ON THAT BUT- THAT IS MY POINT OF VIEW ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD HEAR ABOUT YEAH THIS PARTICULAR AND TO ANSWER THAT THE REASON WE GOT THIS BILL GONE IS THE OPT OUTREALLY CUTS PARENTS OUT A LOOP IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE HOW THIS GOT STARTED A THE PASTOR IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY CALLED ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE DID HE FOUND OUT HIS DISTRICT. WHAT THE SCHOOL IMPLEMENTED THIS TO CURRICULUM OKAY. ANY BOARD APPROVAL. AND WITHOUT ANY- TELL ANY PARENT SO THE PARENTS WERE SHOCKED WHEN THEIR KIDS CAME HOME TOLL THAT. FULL IT TO HIM SO HE DID A LITTLE RESEARCH HE HAS A LARGE CONGREGATION. AND HE ASKS CONGER GETS TO- TAKEN KEEP THESE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A DAY AND THEY DID. AN ARE THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT WAS DOWN THERE PRETTY QUICK I THINK ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS OR SOMETHING. BUT THE THING IS SEE THIS HAPPENING OTHER PLACES TOO SO THE OPT OUT IS NOT. WORKING BECAUSE- IT'S ARE FINDING OUT AFTER THE FACT THEIR KIDS GET THIS. INFORMATION THEN THEY FOUND OUT CUT OFF. SHOULD A MALE THAT THING IN AS IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO HAVE THE PARENTS REVIEW THE MATERIAL. MY GOODNESS AGAIN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'VE BEEN MENTION IS WHERE YOU GO FIELD TRIP. YOU NEED A PERMISSION SLIP AND SO ONCE. A AND AGAIN IT'S GREATER ACCESS TO THE PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THAT STUFF AND THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ACTIVE WAY OF SIGN YOUR CHILD UP JUST LIKE THEY DO ON FIELD TRIPS- YOU CAN HAVE A- HIGHER PROPENSITY OF PARENTS. MAKING A DECISION. WILL DOUBT THAT SMASHED. YOU GET THIS SOON WHICH- OR DO WHAT BILL TRAP THAT WE MAIL A LETTER THE PARENT TOLL ON. A FIELD TRIP NOTHING COMES BACK THAT MUST BE I MEAN. YOU COULD LOWER BELLY CAN GO. PLAY WITH THE TIGERS THAT VISIT. SO THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AT A PREVIOUS THAT I'LL NOTE I AM A FATHER- USUALLY THE PERMISSION SLIP FOR THE FIELD TRIP IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TRAVELING OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND WHAT THERE'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE TURTLE OCCASIONAL WHICH THEY'RE GOING- OUTSIDE AND HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTUAL CONTENT USUALLY I HAVE TO CALL AND FIND OUT TO THE PERMISSIONS REALLY ABOUT REMOVAL THE CHILD FROM THE SCHOOL THE REST OF OUR- TWO OTHER ENVIRO. BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE FAULT. SO YOU KNOW I THINK QUIBBLE ABOUT THAT. CAN I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AND- AGAIN APPRECIATE THE ADOPTING FOR DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PANCER WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I WENT TO THE PARENTAL RIGHTS- MY A. Y. SPENT- FIVE YEARS TEACHING HIV AIDS THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WAS KIND OF BURSTING SOMETIMES BE LIKE IN A SUPERMARKET SOME GO HEY THERE'S A SEX LADY. SO I WAS MARRIED TO THE SEX LADY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS WHICH HAS BEEN GREAT- SO THE OPPONENTS TO THE BILL HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAVE ALL THE SAFEGUARDS AND EVERYTHING'S HUNKY DORY. ANY SENSE I DON'T LAST BUT THE ONE THAT HAS BROUGHT THIS PROPOSED SIZE EACH COUPLE MAYES TED BRIEFLY SHARE YOUR STORY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT DID NOT WORK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WORK FOR ME MY DISTRICT IMPLEMENTED CURRICULUM WITHOUT BOARD OVER SO. WHAT DISTRICT WAS COUNTY LET'S DISTRICT THANK YOU BELL SITE WITH REVIEW. WITHOUT ABOARD VOTE AND NO PARENT INPUT ELEVEN SINCE FOR TEN YOUR. IN THE CURRICULUM ME FOR ABOUT FOUR FIVE WEEKS WHEN I CONFRONTED THE STAFFER. AND ASKED HER IT APPEARS TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO. STOP ME FROM SEEING THIS CURRICULUM IS THAT JUST MY IMPRESSION OR- IS WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO. AND SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO SEE IT. AND THE REASON WHY SHE DIDN'T IS BECAUSE EVERY PARENT WHO. DID. UP THERE TOO OUT. NOW WHEN I DO IT. I DID UP TO MY CHILDREN OUT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE OF MY BOARD IMPLEMENTING THIS CURRICULUM AND HIDING IT FROM ME IT MEETING THAT THEY DID SO AND THE STAFF FOR EVEN ADMITTED IT TO THE BOARD IN A BOARD. IN OF THE HATTER COME A PRESENT TO THE BOARD. AND SHE SHE THAT. MY STE THREE HOWEVER IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY DISTRICT. IT IS TOLD BY THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PARENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'RE DISTRICTS ARE. REGULAR DURING AN OPT OUT THE MANY MANY. WHO HAVE HAD THEIR CHILDREN OPTED OUT AND THEY WERE INSTRUCTED ANYWAY SO THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE OPT OUT WE NEED AN OPT IN TWO INCH- THAT PARENTS HAVE MADE THE DECISION AND THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL COMPLY IT. IS INTO THAT I INTENDED. SAID THAT IF SHE IS AVAILABLE TO HER AND OPT IN FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THE LAW PROHIBITED NOW WHY DID SHE WANT THAT OFF AND SHE WANTED IT BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE SCHOOL THIS AND THE TEACHERS BOARD WERE AT RISK THE BILL IF THE ISSUE. AND YOU TO THOSE LIABILITY SHE THE END UP AND PROTECTED THEM. THAT'S MY SUPERINTENDENT AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOUR SUPERINTENDENT. BELOW SEVENTH GRADERS SO K. THROUGH SIX EVERY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT IN THE STATE HAS THE OPT IN RIGHT SO THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT RIGHT NOT ACCORDING TO HER YET ACCORDING TO HER IT'S IN THE EDUCATION CODE IF YOU READ IT YOU WILL SEE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT. TOLD YOU WHAT THE RULES WERE WHEN WE STARTED IF YOU LIKE IT YOU GO LIKE THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOUR QUIET OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE ASKED TO LEAVE. THIS BILL PLACES THE OPT IN IN THE CODE. FOR ELEMENTARY K. THROUGH SIX THE IT'S ALREADY THERE SENATOR MORALE. OKAY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR DRAWS SO. YES JUST THE LAST QUESTION IF I COULD ASK THE OTHER TWO WITNESSES TO COMMENT PLEASE. HELP IS THERE A SPECIFIC QUESTION THE LAST QUESTION ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE- YES THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS MICHELLE MCKNIGHT I AM A PARENT CAPISTRANO UNIFIED IN ORANGE COUNTY- OUR DISTRICT WENT THROUGH A VERY VERY- ROBUST REVIEW PROCESS WE HAD A- SEX ED TASK FORCE WHICH MANY DISTRICTS ARE SAYING IN MY COUNTY. I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AS ALWAYS I WAS ALSO PART OF THAT TASK FORCE AND WE HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTAL INPUT AT BOARD MEETINGS. AS WELL AS IN THE SEX A TASK FORCE. OUR DISTRICT PRESENTED THE CURRICULA AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT MIDDLE SCHOOLS- OVER PROBABLY A FOUR WEEK PERIOD THEY ALSO DID Q. AND A SESSIONS THEY ALSO ACCEPTED. RENTAL QUESTIONS TO BE PUT ON A CARD SO. BY THE TIME IN OUR BOARD DID VOTE ON IT AND BY THE TIME WE ACTUALLY DID HAVE A CURRICULA THAT WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THERE WERE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS TO HAVE INPUT IN THE COMMUNITY- OUR DISTRICT ALSO HAS TWO BINDERS ONE FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ONE FOR HIGH SCHOOL. IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICE YOU ARE ABLE TO GO IN THAT OFFICE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE A PARENT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CURRICULA YOU CAN READ IT. ALL THE VIDEOS THAT ARE PART OF OUR SEX ED CURRICULUM ARE LISTED THERE AS WELL. THERE IS FULL TRANSPARENCY WE HAVE PHONE CALLS WE HAVE EMAILS- IT'S IN THE PRINCIPLES LETTER IT'S BASICALLY EVERYWHERE AND- EVEN WITH THAT I WOULD SAY THERE WERE STILL SOME. CONTROVERSY AROUND BUT WE ACTUALLY DID COME UP WITH- WE'VE IMPLEMENTED IT IN THIS LAST YEAR THE FEEDBACK FROM OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF CURRICULUM. FROM OUR PRINCIPLES AND FROM THE STUDENTS AN ADMIN HAS BEEN VERY VERY POSITIVE WE HAD VERY FEW PEOPLE OPTING OUT. AND IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE'RE COMING TOGETHER AGAIN TO SORT OF REVIEW WHAT'S MISSING WHAT CAN WE ADD WHAT WAS NOT NECESSARY AGAIN WITH PARENTAL INPUT. SO I HAD A VERY POSITIVE XPERIENCE IN CAPISTRANO YOU RIDE WITH OUR TASK FORCE AND OUR OUR PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR RUSSELL. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S PROBABLY THE- MODEL. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCAL AGENCIES SHOULD FOLLOW- I AM A 100% FOR PARENT INVOLVEMENT FOR PARENT. KNOWLEDGE OF FULL DISCLOSURE TO PARENTS I COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT- MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THAT- HAVE TRADITIONALLY HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THAT KIND OF DECISION MAKING SOME VERY BIG. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED N THE DECISION MAKING BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO FIX. IF IT'S BEING DONE THE WRONG WAY IF PARENTS ARE NOT BEING INCLUDED IF DISTRICTS ARE MAKING DECISIONS WITH THAT. MOMENT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS THAT'S A PROBLEM WE SHOULD FIX. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. THE WAY THAT IT IS SET UP THERE IS AN ITEM NOT GOING TO REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT SENATOR POUND SAID BUT THE WAY IT'S SET UP IS FOR LOCAL AGENCIES LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. TO GO pNOT LET'S FIX THAT UP THAT'S THE PROCESS WERE PARENTS SHOULD BE INVOLVED- I DO THINK THAT THOSE THAT PROCESS SHOULD INVOLVE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR- NON ENGLISH SPEAKING OR NON PRIMARY ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED SO I WOULD. WISH FOR THAT UP PART AS WELL. OF AND THEN LEAVE IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT DECISION YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CHILD NOT PARTICIPATE SO I'VE SEEN. WHAT I SEE BEFORE ME IS. A WAY IN WHICH EVERY PARENT EITHER COLLECTIVE OR INDIVIDUALLY PERSONALLY THE RIGHT. TO IS HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN- AND I THINK THAT THERE IT'S IMPORTANT. I SEE THIS EDUCATION AS A HEALTH. A HEALTH ISSUE UP IN. OUR PARK BUILDER NEED TO BE TAUGHT AND IF WE DON'T AGREE HOW LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT BUT IT IS A HEALTH CARE ISSUE AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF TEEN PREGNANCIES IS JUST ONE PIECE OF IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS INVOLVED WITH SEX EDUCATION THE IT'S NOT SEXUALITY IT'S ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE OF OUR CHILDREN SO I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THE MODEL. THAT YOU MADE UP- AND- BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THERE IS A PROCESS FOR PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED TO MAKE DECISIONS- THAT I WILL BE OPPOSE IN THIS. THANK YOU CENTER ALSO ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR DISCUSSION FROM THE DAIS OKAY THANK YOU ARE BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE AN A MORALE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO WEIGH IN. AS A MOTHER OF TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD TWIN DAUGHTERS WHO HAD SEX EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS- I DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT AGE APPROPRIATE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AS A PARENT. TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL IF I WENT INTO THE SCHOOL AND FOR IT WHICH I BELIEVE ALL PARENTS HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. IF YOU DO IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILD TO RECEIVE SEX EDUCATION I WOULD BE VERY PROACTIVE AS A PARENT I WOULD WALK TO THE OFFICE THEN I WOULD SAY MY DAUGHTER IS. OUR SON IS IN. YOU KNOW WHAT. IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK NO AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT I WILL ASK FOR THE SERGEANTS TO REMOVE FEEL. IF I DID NOT MY CHILD. TO RECEIVE SEX EDUCATION I WOULD GO INTO THE OFFICE I WOULD SPEAK TO THE PRINCIPLE. AND I WOULD ASK THAT WHENEVER THE TIME ARISES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION. BUT DID NOT WANT MY CHILD TO BE A PART OF THAT ALL. THEY MET WHICH WOULD BE I UNDERSTAND. WE DID NOT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WRONG. SEVERAL WE'VE WORKED WITH YOU FOR A YEAR ON THIS BILL- WE AGREE WITH YOU I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE ONLINE IN THE TRANSPARENCY PIECE A HUNDRED PERCENT- WE OFFER TO SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADDRESS TO SENATOR TO RASS CONCERNS YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THOSE AND WE MADE A FAIR I MADE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THE OPTIM PIECE WOULD MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT VOTE ON I THINK THAT PARENTS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN MY CHILDREN'S EDUCATION I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS IN THIS ROOM HAVE READ THE EDUCATION MATERIAL THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED VERY GOOD. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT IS NOT AGE APPROPRIATE. IF YOU. I DON'T LIE I DON'T LIE YOU MAY DISAGREE. I AM NOT IMMORAL AND I AM NOT A LIAR IT JUST BECAUSE WE THIS IS THE WRONG WITH THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE DISCOURSE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW IF WE DON'T AGREE YOU CALL PEOPLE A LIAR I HAVE NOT CAUGHT DISAGREED WITH MANY OF YOU AND I HAVEN'T CALLED ANY IF YOU A LIAR. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE LYING. SO THERE IS SOME THERE ARE SOME THINGS GOING AROUND ONLINE THAT ARE BEING PROPAGATES PROPAGATED BY- SENATORS OR A SENATOR. IN THIS BUILDING. AND IT SAYS THAT WE ARE TEACHING ANAL SEX. SEXTING CYBERSEX. PHONE SEX SENSATION PLATE AND KINKY SEX. IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRICULUM. IT IS NOT THERE. IT IS NOT THERE IT IS NOT YOU WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE POINTING. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE POINTING I SEE YOU. WHAT YOU'RE POINTING OUT WAS REMOVED THAT WAS A VERSION. OKAY WELL WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT. IT'S NOT THERE IT'S NOT BEING TAUGHT- I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS. IS PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT SEX. AND. THANK YOU. AND IT'S NOT CONDESCENDING I KNOW BECAUSE I AGE BOY BOY YOU GUYS OR SOMETHING ELSE. CENTER AROUND YOU CAN ASK YOUR WITNESSES TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE PROCESS I'D ASK YOU TO BE RESPECT. I DOUBTS IDEA I WOULD ASK YOU TO BE RESPECTFUL BUT ALSO- THEIR PARENTS YOU ARE LECTURING SO I'M NOT LECTURING I'M GIVING MY OPINION YOU KNOW WHAT BUT WE'RE DONE I AM RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE ON THE BILL SENATE MORALE PLEASE CLOSE. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA FOR A YEAR. LECTURE. LISTEN I BOUGHT SOME OF THE CURRICULUM. ON AMAZON BECAUSE THEY HAD DIFFERENT RESOURCES ALMOST I REMEMBER- DANTE'S INFERNO THE SEVEN LAYERS OF HELL YOU HAD TO REALLY WORK TO THEIR CURRICULUM KEEP GOING DOWN THEY HAD RESOURCE GUIDES AND BOOKS THE BY THEN SUGGESTED READING I BOUGHT THAT STUFF AND- IT'S REALLY NOT AS YOU SAY THAT STUFF IS IN THERE I I'VE I'VE GOT IT I COULD. GET IF YOU LIKE TO SEE THOSE PICTURES AND YOUR VOTING WILL PASS IT HERE'S MINE THIS THIS THIS BILL A NO VOTE- TAKES PARENTS OUT OF THE LOOP. I THINK IT'S DISRESPECTFUL FOR AN ABSTENTION BY THE WAY- BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK PARENTS SHOULD HAVE FULL ACCESS EVEN THESE LETTERS THAT WERE WRITTEN BELIEVE THAT HAVING PARENTS SEE FULL TRANSCRIPT PERRANCE SIENNA. SCHOOL LESSONS THAT IS TOO MUCH WORK TOO MUCH PROBLEM. THAT'S WRONG AND- YES YOU DID NOT HELP FOR ME AMENDMENT WHICH I WANT TO THANK YOU BUT IT WAS TAKEN THE OTHER HALF OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL AWAY SO IT'S LIKE. YOU OFFERED ME. WHICH I THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT THEN YOU TO I GUESS THE STAKE AWAY YOU KNOW WHICH WAS THE OP DAN SO THAT'S WHY. IT WASN'T THAT I WAS ON COOPER CAT I JUST- I'M HERE TO SERVE THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'VE ASKED ME NOT TO COMPROMISE IN THIS BILL AND NOT COMPROMISE OUR CHILDREN SO THAT'S WHY I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE YOUR MEMBERS BUT YOU KNOW I SURE THERE WAS THE ONE PASTOR WHO WHO TOLD PEOPLE STATE OUT OF SCHOOL AND I'M A PRODUCT OF THE- LEAST IN EARLY GRADES OF A. SCHOOL AND- SOME WOULD SAY THE- GOOD JOB OTHERS MAY SAY THEY DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB WITH ME BUT- BUT I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE DOCTOR SOBEL EVEN SAID EARLIER HE'S SPOKEN TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE BY THE WORK. THEY COULD BE AN EXODUS OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND OTHER PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND HOME SCHOOLING- KEEPING PEOPLE I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE BASED ON WHAT THIS OTHER PASTOR DEBT ARE GONNA- YOU KNOW HAVE WEAKER DAY OUT OF SCHOOL WHICH IS ONLY GONNA HURT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IN HONORABLE MIDI MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KISHA MURPHY FROM THE TIME FOR CHANGE FOUNDATION AND ROUTE TO REBOUND I HAVE BEEN A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN ON ONE OF. ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX ONE CARE CERTIFY CLINICIANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALSO FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN. I HAVE ATTAINED A CERTIFICATE OR ABILITY TATIAN TO THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN WEST COAST UNIVERSITY WHICH IS A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION PURSUING MY BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN NURSING IN THE WHERE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AFTER ACCUMULATING- ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS. AND JUST SIX MONTHS FIVE COMPLETING MY DEGREE I WAS EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL THE UNIVERSITY'S ETHICS COMMITTEE REASON FOR MY EXPULSION WAS THAT THEY FELT IT WAS UNLIKELY THATI WOULD OBTAIN LICENSOR AND EMPLOYMENT POST GRADUATION BECAUSE OF MY CRIMINAL HISTORY. GET I'M ALREADY A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE EMPLOYED IN. THE DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITAL SYSTEM I CAN'T TELL YOU THE HEARTBREAK I FELT THERE WAS NO CONSIDERATION OF MY PERFORMANCE AS A STUDENT THE FACT THAT I EARNED A CERTIFICATE A REHABILITATION OR THE FACT THAT I'M CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AS AN LPN. PEOPLE SAY EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO PREVENT INCARCERATION AND RECIDIVISM I HAVE BEEN OUT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS DURING THAT TIME I HAVE APPLIED TO HAVE BEEN DENIED EMISSIONS TO SIX SCHOOLS DURING MY DUE TO MY PAST INCARCERATION I DIDN'T GIVE UP I FINALLY FOUND A SCHOOL THAT WOULD EMIT ME. I FEEL THAT I HAVE FOUND MY PURPOSE AND I WAS ON THE RIGHT PATH SO I HOPE THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SENSE OF DEVASTATION I FELT AFTER BEING REJECTED YET AGAIN STAFF YEARS OF FIGHTING FOR ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION STILL I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR MY EDUCATION AND A BETTER LIFE WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PREVENT POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS FROM LOCKING OUT FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE SEEKING HIGHER EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES THEIR FAMILIES. AND BECOME TAX PAYING CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ACCEPT TITLE FOR FUNDING. OUR PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS AND THEN DENY OR WITHIN ACCESS TO ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED STUDENTS ON ACCOUNT AND THEIR CONVICTION HISTORY. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS UNFAIR AND SET BACK. SET ME BACK ON MY JOURNEY. SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL PREVENT POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS FROM INFLICTING THIS AND JUSTICE ON OTHERS PLEASE VOTE. ON THE BILL SEVEN SEVEN SIX AND BANNED THE BY THE HIGHER EDUCATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SORRY TO HEAR WHAT HAVE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU THAT'S NOT RIGHT. NEXT WITNESS MADAM CHAIR- HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR BRADY HEINER- I'M A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PROJECT REBOUND AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM SO I ADDRESS YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR NINE PUBLICLY FUNDED PROGRAMS AT CSU CAMPUSES. ACROSS THE STATE. THE MISSION OF PROJECT REBOUND IS TO SUPPORT THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM COME FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED- AND EDUCATIONALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. OUR PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THE STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAMS 64% OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO. DO NOT RETURN TO PRISON. AFTER MORE THAN THREE YEARS OF OPERATE IN. THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM HAS IS 0% RECIDIVISM RATE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY GOVERNOR NEW SOME IN THE STATE LEGISLATOR STATE LEGISLATURE- ACTED LAST YEAR TO INVEST IN THE CSU PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM. TO ALLOW US TO SUSTAIN AND SCALE ARE PROVEN MODEL OF SUCCESS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN SIX IS ESSENTIAL TO THE ACTUALIZATION OF PROJECT REBOUNDS MISSION TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM INCREASE STRONGER SAFER COMMUNITIES THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION. BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEVEN SEVEN SIX WOULD REMOVE A CRITICAL BARRIER TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY APPLICANTS. THANKFULLY CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS DO NOT REQUEST ARREST AND CONVICTION HISTORY INFORMATION IN UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS. HOWEVER THERE REMAINS A WIDESPREAD ARBITRARY PATTERN OF DENYING IN MISSION TO ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS PRACTICE PERSISTS AMONG GRADUATE LEVEL PROGRAMS AT BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS PRIVATE UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTIONS. TWO MONTHS AGO AT THE URGING OF CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON PRESIDENT FRAM ROSE VERGY CSU CHANCELLOR TIMOTHY WHITE HAND DELIVERED TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF THE PARDON OF MERE AMINI. MERE IS AN ALUMNUS OF PROJECT REBOUND AND pSTATE FULLERTON COMMUNITY. LAST YEAR HE WAS AWARDED THE STEWARD OF PLACE AWARD BY THE UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR INTERNSHIPS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR HIS WORK MENTORING UNDERSERVED YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY. AND YET DESPITE EARNING A THREE POINT SEVEN GPA AND MANY OTHER ACCOLADES MERE WAS TOLD BY THE MASTERS IN COUNSELING PROGRAM AT CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS THAT BORDER TO APPLY HE MUST PRESENT A CERTIFICATE OF CLEARANCEFROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE A CERTIFICATE YOU COULD NOT PROVIDE DUE TO A CRIMINAL CONVICTION FROM NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. WHEN HE WAS JUST EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. YOU'RE SAID TO ME WHEN I WALKED IN FOR THAT THE MASTER. PLAN PROGRAM AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS WOULD NOT ADMIT ME DUE TO MY PAST IT HIT ME LIKE A TON OF BRICKS. I FELT LIKE ALL THAT I HAD ACCOMPLISHED AT CSU FULLERTON AND IN MY LIFE AFTER MY RELEASE SEEM FEW TILE. LIKE MY PAST WOULD ALWAYS PREVENT ME FROM SERVING MY COMMUNITY AND LIVING A PURPOSEFUL LIFE. FORTUNATELY FOR ME AND HIS FAMILY MERE WILL BECOME A FATHER NEXT MONTH AND FORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF THE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS WHO MAYOR IS NOW DALY AND JOYFULLY SERVING AT THE C. AS THE CSU FULLERTON. PROJECT REBOUND ENROLLMENT SPECIALIST. THE MASTERS IN COUNSELING PROGRAM AT CSU LONG BEACH DID NOT UNJUSTLY BARRED MAYOR FROM THEIR PROGRAM OR REQUIRE HIM TO DISCLOSE HIS CRIMINAL HISTORY. MERS CASE EXEMPLIFIES THE NEED FOR SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN SIX. IN ONE IN THE SAME CSU SYSTEM YOU HAVE A STUDENT HO IS RECEIVE THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION NOT JUST FROM HIS PROFESSORS BUT FROM HIS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT AND THE CSU CHANCELLOR HIMSELF. AND YET ARBITRARY POLICIES MADE BY PROFESSORS ARE ADMINISTRATORS AND GRADUATE PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE IN THE CSU LOCKED MERE OUT OF THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP IN HIS CAREER A CAREER THAT THE CSU PREPARED HIM FOR. AT THE CSU ADMINISTRATOR AND PROFESSOR I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO JUDGE THE ACADEMIC MERITS OF APPLICANTS SEEKING ADMISSIONS- TO PROGRAMS IN THE FIELDS OF OUR EXPERTISE. HOWEVER THE LAW SHOULD NOT ALLOW US TO CATEGORICALLY BAR APPLICANTS WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORIES. RATHER THE LAW SHOULD REQUIRE THAT POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS GIVE ALL APPLICANTS A FAIR CHANCE TO BE JUDGED ON THEIR ACTED. THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ALL SUPPORT BANNING THE BOX FOR HIGHER EDUCATION MADAM CHAIR- HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE VOTE BY ON SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN SIX SO THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS LIKE MERE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY PLEASE COME FORWARD. SO THE PROPONENTS WENT OVER A LITTLE BIT SO I WILL GIVE YOU UP TO FIVE MINUTES. OKAY. JUSTTRYING TO BE IS APPLICABLES POSSIBLE SO. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. AREA SORRY I'M ALEX GRAVES THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE REPRESENT EIGHTY FIVE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE- WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL OPPOSE POSITION RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN ASSESSING THE PROPOSAL IN THE LAST WEEK SINCE THE LANGUAGES INTERVIEWS BUT WE DID WANT TO SHARE. AT LEAST ONE OF OUR CONCERNS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO THINK THROUGH WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS- I THINK THE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE LICENSURE COMPLEXITY WITH THIS I WON'T FOCUS ON THAT BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE- SOMETHING REGARDING ACCREDITATION. THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT SO FOR MANY OF OUR- GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS ADVANCED DEGREES- THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN ACCREDITATION STUDENTS HAVE TO DO A COUPLE ROTATION SO THIS IS FOR THINGS LIKE PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY NURSING DENTAL PROGRAMS FAMILY COUNSELING- MEDICINE SOCIAL WORK. AND YES. SO OFTEN TIMES WHAT WE FIND IS THAT- DEPENDING ON WHAT IS IN THAT- STUDENTS BACKGROUND- THOSE. FACILITIES THAT WERE PARTNERING WITH FOR THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WON'T TAKE STUDENTS WITH CERTAIN- THINGS THAT MIGHT SHOW UP IN THOSE I KNOW I SHOULD SAY THAT. THE QUESTION AROUND- CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WHAT HAVE YOU WAS NOT AN AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIER RATHER OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE THAN TRYING TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT IT IS IN THAT BACKGROUND AND IF. THEY FOR WHATEVER'S FLAG IN THAT IS SOMETHING LIKELY TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PLACE THE STUDENTS IN THAT CLINICAL ROTATION. BECAUSE OUT WITH THEN WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE ENROLLING STUDENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF BEING ABLE TO KIND OF HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FIGURE THIS OUT. BE ENROLLING STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM A. B. IN ORDER TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY THAT TUITION FOR GRADUATE PROGRAMS THAT THEN WE CAN NOT. LIKELY ENSURE THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THE PROGRAM- AND GET THAT DEGREE AND GO ON TO GET A JOB SO- YOU KNOW IN TALKING WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS LIKE WESTERN UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES IN THE POMONA AREA CHICAGO SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY LOS ANGELES- LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY- WE ARE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT THAT- AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO- EXPLORE- AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE- ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT ADDRESS THAT NEW ONES SO THAT WE ARE NOT- PUTTING STUDENTS KNOW PROGRAM HAVING SIR AGAIN TO PAY AND TAKE OUT LOANS FOR THESE PROGRAMS IF WE CAN'T- PRESUME THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY COMPLETE THAT. GOING INTO THE WORKFORCE WITH THAT DEGREE. ANY ANYBODY STE THE MOVIE ANYBODY ELSE- IN OPPOSITION. I'M ON A DATE AT SIXTEEN SEVEN A QUESTION FOR YOU SO TO ME THAT QUESTION IS ABOUT THE LICENSURE BUREAU WHATEVER BUT YOU'RE SAYING. BASED UPON POTENTIALLY RESPONSE SOMEBODY'S BACKGROUND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE CLINICAL WORK AND WHAT IN PARTICULAR OFFICE IN CERTAIN FACILITIES. RIGHT THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND TALKING WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS AND- YOU KNOW I AM STILL TRYING TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ADVANCED DEGREE PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONES I MENTIONED WHERE THE ACCREDITING BODY- WHICH I THINK FOR ALL THAT MIGHT BE WHY ASK- REQUIRES AS PART OF THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM FOR ACCREDITATION TO HAVE- SIR NUMBER OF HOURS RIGHT NOW CLINICAL SETTING. THANK YOU SIR. AT THIS POINT A PULL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND- THE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF A POST GRADUATE PROGRAM I WAS A RESIDENCY DIRECTOR- AND TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY OVER ALSO MEDICAL STUDENTS I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN I JUST WANNA CLARIFY IN RELATION TO THIS BILL THOUGH. WHAT THIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T USE OUR ASK ABOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY ON THE INITIAL APPLICATION. BUT AFTER REVIEW YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY POTENTIALLY. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW THE DESIRES ACTUALLY TO DO AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE- THAT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY OFFER ADMISSION. AT THAT POINT YOU CAN. ASK ABOUT THE CRIMINAL HISTORY IS THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE NATURE OF THE WAY THE BILL'S STRUCTURE IS THAT CORRECT. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF WOULD RESTRICT POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS FROM ASKING ABOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY- AT ANY POINT IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS UP UNTIL THE FINAL DETERMINATION. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THOUGH BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY OFFER ADMISSION. YOU CAN ASK BEFORE YOU MAKE THE FINAL DECISION CORRECT OKAY HI I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT- HOPEFULLY ADDRESSES THE CONCERN OF THE INDEPENDENT REVERSED I MEAN THIS IS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LARGER CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES ARE APPROPRIATE AND SO FORTH BUT THEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLINICAL EDUCATION. IT'S NO DID THEN WE'D CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS- SAME TIME THAT THEY CAN'T GET LICENSED IF- FOR SOME REASON AND- SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN STATE LAW THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO NOT HAVE CERTAIN TYPES OF CONVICTIONS- TO BE L. IT ALONE WITH A PATIENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH WE HAVE TO FEET WE HAVE TO WORK THAT PART OUT BUT WE CAN'T DO LIKELY A SITUATION I THINK IS PRESENTED WHERE YOU HAVE A STUDENT WHO START TO PROGRAM IS AT FORTY UNABLE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM. YET YOU KNOW AND GET THE BENEFIT OF THAT EDUCATION BECAUSE OF- OF SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD BE NOT FAIR TO THE STUDENT ACTUALLY FOR THEM NOT TO BE AWARE OF THAT SITUATION. PRIOR TO THAT- PRIOR TO ADMISSION SURE A MAN AND MY COLLEAGUE AT RESPONSE. I'M HELLO THANK YOU MY NAME IS SONYA THOMAS AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH WRITTEN REBOUND. I'M I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT- THAT CONVICTION HISTORY INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE USED UP UNTIL THE FINAL DECISION AND MISSIONS. ON THE BILL DOES NOT TOUCH ON ANYTHING RELATED TO DISCIPLINARY RECORDS SO THAT CAN STILL BE UTILIZED BY A SCHOOLS. ON THE BELIEVE WHICH SENATOR WILL Q. ALLUDED TO IS THAT ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT PROPERLY SITUATED OR PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE LEGAL ADVICE THAT'S NECESSARY. FOR STUDENTS PURSUING LICENSURE- THERE. IS A BELIEF THAT THAT SHOULD BE HANDLED BY ADVISING WITHIN SCHOOLS WHO ARE PROPERLY TRAINED ADVISORS WHO UNDERSTAND LICENSURE AND THE VERY RAPIDLY CHANGING LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. I ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT A COMPLICATING FACTOR AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE HERE I'M SPEAKING ON ON ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AND WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS A COMPLICATING FACTORS THAT LICENSURE VARIES BY EVERY STATE. I'M SO THE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION OFTEN IS LEADING TO PROFESSIONS THAT THE PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT BE LICENSE AS A LICENSED LAWYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE LAWYERS WHO ARE ON MY TEAM ARE NOT LICENSED. BEFORE YOU ARE FULLY ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB- SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. BILL IS IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S DEAL WITH IT. AND UP UNTIL THE FINAL DECISION AND THAT LAYS INJURED BY SHOULD BE HANDLED SEPARATELY. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK HE WANTED WAY IN. YEAH AND I MEAN IS I IS WE READ THE BILL- SUBSECTION BE WHEN IT SAYS OR AT ANY TIME DURING THE ADMISSION PROCESS BEFORE THE INSTITUTIONS FINAL DECISION RELATIVE TO THE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION. WE READ THAT INTERPRET THAT IS IT WE CANNOT ASK UNTIL A FINAL DETERMINATION. AFTER A FINAL DETERMINATION PERMISSION IS BEEN MADE AND IF THAT'S NOT THE END TEN WE LOVE TO. CLARIFY THAT. BUT THAT THAT'S HOW WE READ THE BILL. SO AGAIN MY QUESTION IS TO THE SPONSORS IS DO WE HAVE A LEASE AGREEMENT AND CONCEPTS OF THAT. THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS. THE PARTICULARLY FOR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU KNOW THEIR EDUCATION MAY REQUIRE THAT- MAYBE LIMITED BECAUSE- BASICALLY TO ASK ABOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY PRIOR TO ACTUALLY MAKING E. L. WELTS BEFORE THE ACTUAL- FINAL DECISION BECAUSE IT'S BEFORE MAKING THE OFFER RIGHT YOU CAN'T MAKE A DECISION TO ADMIT AND THEN. THE DENTAL SO I MEAN. I GOT THE LIKE INITIAL APPLICATION BUT THE- BUT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY AT- FOR A DECISION HIGHER EDUCATION- TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO REQUESTS AND REVIEW INFORMATION PRIOR TO THEIR- FUND FINAL DECISION FOR ADMISSION. OKAY YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH HI YET THANK YOU KATRINA ROBINSON FROM CENTER SKINNER STAFF THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR PAN FOR YOUR QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY CLARIFY FROM. FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE-AND THANK YOU FOR INDULGING THAT NONTRADITIONAL PRESENTATION TODAY- BUT- THE CURRENT TAX THE BILL DOES READ THAT YOU CANNOT CONSIDER THE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED STATUS OF THE INDIVIDUAL- UNTIL A DETERMINATION IS MADE ON AND ON ADMISSION. OF THING WITH OUR SPONSORS AND- SOME THE GROUPS THAT WE'VE BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS OR TO EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH- THAT HAVE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL WHETHER OR AT WHAT POINT THERE SHOULD POTENTIALLY BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT ACCREDITATION OR- OR REQUIREMENTS THAT THE SCHOOL HAS- ON THOSE TYPES OF HIGHER EDUCATION- DEGREES. BUT I THINK THIS IS THAT WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL OPPOSITION YES WE ARE AN EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH PARTIES- TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOS COULD TRULY DOES REQUIRE- CERTAIN TYPES OF FACILITIES TO- BE THE ONES THAT ARE- INTERACTING WITH THE STUDENTS OR IF IT'S JUST THAT THE ABILITY THE SCHOOL PARTNERS WITH. HAS A RESTRICTION BECAUSE IT'S DEFECTIVE WALK ACCREDITATION REQUIRES IT VERSUS THE SCHOOL THE INDIVIDUAL DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO IT FOR SO WHY ASK ISN'T THE ONLY. TREPIDATION BODY SO I GUESS. BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT I THINK. THE AND THE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS THE AYE AYE AYE AYE A NOT INTERESTED IN TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF INCARCERATION FROM BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO THE SICKLY PURSUE WHAT THEY WANT TO TRY PURSUE I DO THINK THAT THE- AND BIG HAULAGE IS I MEAN THERE THERE IS SERVICE THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH- IF. THE STUDENT IS NOT. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE AND AGAIN THIS IS. MEET THE SECOND FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS NOT ALL OF YOUR TRAINING SITES ANY OF CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM BUT THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY IN YOUR OWN CONTROL RIGHT. SO AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT I WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ACTUALLY BECAUSE A- POTENTIAL CLINICAL SITE ACTUALLY HAD STANDARDS THAT WE DISAGREE WITH YOU CHOSE NOT TO. CONTACT WITHOUT THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND CLINICAL SITES IN FACT THAT'S BEEN GETTING MORE MORE DIFFICULT OVER TIME THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR THEM. AND SO THE CHALLENGE THERE IS THAT. IT IT SO IT'S NOT THE UNIVERSITY IT'S ABOUT IF I AM LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO A CLINICAL ROTATION AN ACCIDENT OR FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE NOR FREEDIA LICENSE WHATEVER ELSE OKAY SO. AND THE ONLY THE CLINICAL SAY THAT WE HAVE. FOR WHATEVER REASONS SAYS THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW. YEAH ANYONE WHO HAS CERTAIN TYPE OF CONVICTION TO BE LET'S SAY ALONG WITH THE PATIENT OR WHATEVER AS FOR PATIENT PROTECTION PURPOSES. NOW WE MAY OR MAY NOT DISAGREE OR DISAGREE ABOUT TAT BUT THAT'S THE- ONLY SITE THEY HAVE ARE ALL THEIR SITES HAVE THAT THAT KIND OF RULE ORDER MAY EVEN BE A STATE LAW HAS SENDS THEM SOMETHING WE ACTUALLY REGULATION. THEN IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE STUDIO FAIR TO THE STUDENTS THAT WE ADMIT YOU PROGRAM BUT YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T COMPLETED BECAUSE WE CAN'T PROVIDE YOU. THE KIND OF TRAINING YOU NEED THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETE ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS. THAT SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND SIX- AND THAT'S WHY SAYING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY OPERATE MISSION BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE BASICALLY WHEN YOU OFFER MISSION YOU'RE PROMISING SOMEONE YOU CAN. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GRADUATE AND IF YOU CAN. THAT'S NOT FAIR EITHER. YES I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN FOR DEFINITELY AND I THINK WHAT WHAT I'M JUST SAYING HERE IS- FROM AUTHORS OFFICE WERE TRYING TO PARSE LICENSING. AND GRADUATION AND ACCREDITATION THAT YOU NEED FOR GRADUATION AND YES WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE THAT GET ENROLLED IN A PROGRAM THAT THEY CAN'T GRADUATE FROM BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS- LICENSING HOWEVER IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AND PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO PURSUE. A LICENSE IN THE CREW THEY MAY WANT IT FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE SO WE'RE JUST PARK IN THOSE TWO DISCUSSIONS AND YES WE DO PLAN TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ACCREDITATION AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO GRADUATE PIECE. AND WE JUST REQUESTED THE INDULGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE GROUPS THAT HAVE REACHED OUT RELATIVELY RECENTLY OKAY SO IS THERE A COMMITMENT THAT. SCHOOLS THEY HAVE REASONABLE REASON TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY REVIEW THE CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD BEFORE THEY- MAKE THE FINAL ADMISSION DECISION OFFERED MISSION. WHILE NOT BEING THE MEMBER. HERE TODAY. I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN JUST SAY WE DO PLAN TO CONTINUE THOSE CONGRESS. MAY I ALSO FROM- AGAIN BRADY HIGHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM. TO EXAMPLE SO IN THE CASE OF THE- THE STUDENT HOME I MENTIONED- THE PROGRAM REQUIRED THEY HAD TO TRACK SAID A TRACK OF COUNSELING THAT WENT INTO THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM AND A TRACK THAT WAS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND OUR STUDENT WAS INTERESTED IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION COUNSELING TRACK- AND THERE IS IN THE IN THE EDUCATION CODE RESTRICTION FOR FOLKS GOING INTO CASTING THE K. TO TWELVE BUT THEY WERE APPLYING BUT AND THERE IS NOT IN HIGHER EDUCATION BUT THERE WERE OF APPLYING A REQUIRING A CERTIFICATE OF CLEARANCE. FOR ALL APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF WHICH TRACK THEY WERE GOING INTO- AND THEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ARNOLD TREVINO WHOSE- MSW- GRADUATE AND PROJECT REBOUND ALARM WHO- WAS AT FRESNO STATE AND- IN IN HIS CASE AND IN MANY CASES LIKE HIS- HE GOT A CALL FROM. THE PROGRAM- THAT THEY WERE GOING TO- WITH WITHDRAW HIM FROM THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING. AN INTERNSHIP SITE FOR HIM TO DO AS PRACTICUM- BUT IN THAT INSTANCE IT WAS JUST THE CASE OF A OF AN INTERNSHIP COORDINATOR WHO AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE JUST DIDN'T HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SITES THAT WOULD AND THERE WAS NO LEGAL RESTRICTION THERE IT WAS A- IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION ON THE PART OF- THE THOSE SITES- SO FORTUNATELY PROJECT REBOUND. WAS FOUNDED AT THAT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT HE RECEIVED THAT CALL IN TWO DAYS LATER HE RECEIVED A CALL FROM PROJECT REBOUND WHO WHO HAVE NOW THEY HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT SITES FOR SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS- PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS TO DO THAT PRACTICUM WORK SITES WHICH WILL WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM. TO GET THAT EXPERIENCE SO IN MANY CASES IT'S ABOUT AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT PROJECT REBOUNDS DOZEN THE CSU IS TRYING TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE THAT THAT TRAINING POSSIBLE. THANK YOU OUR REAL QUICK YES I WITH MY SITUATION WEST COAST RAN EIGHT BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND I. I CURRENTLY WORK FOR DIGNITY HEALTH AS AN EMPLOYEE WHICH THEY'RE ALSO PARTNER WITH. I THOUGHT HELP FROM ROUTE REBOUND THEY CONTACT THE WEST BECAUSE I GOT BACK IN SCHOOL SO NOW I GRADUATE NEXT WEEK'S SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU- JUST TO SPEAK ON THAT LIKE THE THEME OF MY APPLICATION IS AT THE BR INTO AS OF THIS MOMENT SO LICENSING DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OBTAINING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WEST BECAUSE IT DID PERFORM. UPON EMISSION IT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF ME BEING THERE IS JUST PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM CAUGHT THEM TO SAY YOU SENT TO SOMEONE ELSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. THEY SAID NO WE DIDN'T AN EX BALTIMORE. SO IS THERE'S NO TALK BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND THE LICENSING THEY FEEL AND THIS ON THEIR WEBSITE IS UNLIKELY FOR ME TO BE LICENSE IN IS UNLIKELY FOR ME TO ATTAIN EMPLOYMENT AFTER GRADUATION. IN WHICH I'M ALREADY LICENSES AND THEY'LL BE IN AN ALREADY WORK FOR THEIR CLINICAL PARTNERS. THANK YOU SIR PAN ANYTHING ELSE. NO. OKAY PITY ANY OTHER ANY OTHER MEMBERS. SING NOW I'M LOOKING FOR A MOTION AGAIN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED HERE PRO SMACK CLOSE I'M YEAH ONE IN MOTION THEM CALLING YOU CLOSE WHICH IS AGES OF FINAL COMMENT FOR ME CONCEPTUALLY HI I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT IN SUPPORT OF IT. HERE FROM THE OPPOSITION- YOU'RE BLESSED SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THE DEATH DILIGENT AUTHOR SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND WITH WITH THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT EVERYTHING GETS WORKED OUT WITH THAT. I'M SURE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON AND I'M ACTUALLY THRILLED THAT I GOT TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND BE HERE TODAY- KISHA MURPHY IS- ONE OF TEAM LATEST FAVORITE PEOPLE AND WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE INJUSTICE IT HAPPENED HER WE WROTE LETTERS OF SUPPORT- AS DID OTHER ELECTED IN OUR OUR REGION. I VIEW THIS BILL AS A SMALL STEP IN A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM AND THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT WE PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED PEOPLE MAKE A MISTAKE THEY GET INCARCERATED THEY GET OUT AND THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND THEN WE DON'T ALLOW THEM TO BE BETTER AND WE DON'T ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A JOB AND SUPPORT THEMSELVES WE WONDER WHY THE RECIDIVISM RATE IS SO HIGH.
