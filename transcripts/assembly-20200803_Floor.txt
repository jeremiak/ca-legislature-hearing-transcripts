SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW AN ACCOLADE THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN MAKING AN APPROPRIATION OF FORCE TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BE RELATED TO THE BUDGET MISTER KING BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL ISN'T AN AMENDED VERSION OF OUR PUBLIC. SAFETY TRAILER BILL THAT WE RETURN TO THE SENATE IN. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE POLICY RELATED TO JUDICIAL DISCRETION FOR MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION OR ELDER PAROLE IN THE MAN'S THAT THE BAND THE BOX PROVISION TO NARROW ITS APPLICATION. WITH THESE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THE REMAINING BILL HAS SEVERAL PUBLIC SAFETY PROVISIONS REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE WE PASSED IN JUNE. IT JUST A PAROLE TERMS TO TWO YEARS FOR DETERMINATE TERMS IN THREE YEARS FOR AN INDETERMINATE TERMINAL ALSO FOR THE PRODUCTION'S BASE ON IT HURTS TO TERMS OF PAROLE. REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF A STATE AND OPERATED PRISON FOR CLOTURE IN TWENTY TWENTY AS WELL AS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT INCREASES LEASE REENUE BOND ALL FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITY APPROVAL PROJECTS THE CDC ARE REQUIRES THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER TO PROVIDE TRAINING. AND ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES OF COMPLEX MATTERS ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE EXPANSION OF REMOTE COURT APPEARANCES AT CDC OUR LIMIT IS THE INTEGRITY THE INTEGRATED SERVICES FOR BATTLE MENTALLY ILL PAROLEES PROGRAM. PROVIDES OF THE DEFINITION OF A CORRECTIONAL PHARMACY IT INCLUDES CHANGES TO ALLOW FOR MORE EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY. THE BILL ALSO UPDATE THE DEFINITION OF AN ASSAULT WEAPON IN A JOB THE BERMAN PAGE HI MY- FROM JULY FIRST FOR FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THE RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RAISED BY THE DENTIST OFFICE. I WITH THE I. FIVE THINGS CHANGE OBERNOLTE RECOGNIZE THIS JUST I RISE IN OUR TO ASK ONE EIGHT THIS BILL EXT THE RELEASE OF CRIME FROM CAL STATE PRISONS. MOST NOTABLY IT REDUCES THE LENGTH OF SUPERVISED PAROLE FROM THREE YEARS TO TWO YEARS IN MOST CASES IN FACT IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES PAROLE BE SHORTENED TO ONLY TWELVE MONTHS. THIS BILL ALSO ELIMINATES THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO RETAIN SUPERVISION OVER AN OFFENDER EVEN AFTER THE BOARD HAS GOOD CAUSE FOR DOING SO. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL WILL SUBSTANTIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT WE REPRESENT I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OVER NOTHING MS KAMLAGER GOV YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE. THEN I AND THEN I RISE TO SPEAK. TO SB ONE EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW I USUALLY RARELY SPEAK ON BUDGET BILLS BECAUSE THEY COME WITH DOLLARS AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE FUND THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS BUT I DO WANT TO. TALK ABOUT TO ALARMING ELEMENTS IN THIS BILL. THE FIRST IS THE- IRRESPONSIBLE DRAFTING AFFECTION A FIVE ONE POINT NINETY THREE BE RELATED TO. ARREST RELIEF GRANTING. AND YOU KNOW WORDS ARE IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY WHEN. DEALING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. THEY REPRESENT DISTINCT LEGAL ACTIONS AND EVENTS AND DISTINCT LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. AND I'M SPEAKING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BE ACQUITTED IF YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED YOU CAN ONLY BE ACQUITTED. IF YOU'VE BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED NOW I KNOW THAT THIS IS A SMALL ISSUE. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT. AN ARRESTEE DOES NOT MAKE YOU A DEFENDANT UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED. AND IT IS IMPRUDENT TO CO MAIN GOAL THESE TERMS. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF THE WORDS. IS LAZY BUT CAN ALSO BE CALM CONFUSING AND PROBLEMATIC TO THE CONSUMERS OF THIS POLICY AND THE CONSUMERS ARE OUR JUDGES ARE ATTORNEYS ARE DEFENDANTS ARE PROBATION OFFICER. AND THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW INTERPRETATION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO RELY ON WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S FREEDOM SO I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. THAT KIND OF CLARITY CAN BE ADJUSTED THE SECOND MORE AGREED JUST ELEMENT FOR ME IS THE MOVE TO PERMIT ELECTRONIC PRELIMINARY HEARINGS AND TRIALS. YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE DEFENDANTS. CHARGED WITH. OFFENSES THAT COME WITH FULLY AND CONSECUTIVE SENTENCING. THAT CAN RESULT IN DOUBLE DIGIT TIME SERVED IN PRISON LIKE FORTY FIVE YEARS FIFTY YEARS SEVENTY FIVE YEARS THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO PUT THEIR DUE PROCESS IN THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT ON THE LINE BY ALLOWING THEM TO AGREE TO TELEPHONE AND VIRTUAL PRELIMINARY HEARINGS. IS DERELICT TO BE NICE. MANY OF US ON THIS FLOOR HAVE BEEN WORKING TO UNRAVEL THE ASSEMBLY LINE THAT IS OUR CAR FEDERAL SYSTEM AND THE GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT PEOPLE HAVE. IS WHEN WE STOP TO HAVE LIVE TRIAL WHEN THE JURY AND THE JUDGES AND THE ATTORNEYS CAN LOOK AT EACH OTHER WHEN YOU CAN LOOK AT MOVEMENT AND I. AND SHARE STORIES WE'D LIKE TO BELIEVE PROBABLY SIX THOUSAND MILES TO COME UP HERE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK ABOUT BILLS HIM PERFECT. SIX AUTOMATICALLY GO TO INDIA BUT WE'RE HERE. DEBATING POLICY. AND I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO BE. QUESTION ABOUT PUTTING THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND DUE PROCESS ON THE LINE OR EVEN TRYING IT OUT THE WINDOW. IN ORDER TO CREATE SOME. BECAUSE OF COVERT. NOW I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE GOOD THINGS ABOUT. THE PAROLE. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER TRAINING THE CLOSING OF THE PRISON AND YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER. BATHWATER'S LOW MURKY. AND SO I'M GOING OVER THIS BILL AND I'M AN URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME I WANT TO SAY TWO DEFENDANT OUT THERE. IF YOU HAVE COUNCIL. THAT SUGGESTS. THAT YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO HAVE. A VIRTUAL OR TELEPHONIC HEARING. OR TRAIL WHEN WE HAVE OUR OWN PROBLEMS KEEPING OUR KIDS THROUGH ONLINE LEARNING OR EVEN HAVING OUR OWN SO MEETINGS IF YOU HAVE COUNCIL THAT DO THAT. YOU FIND THAT PERSON IMMEDIATELY AND RUN BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE YOUR DUE PROCESS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE YOUR CIVIL LIBERTIES IN MINE- THIRTY. AND I WOULD ASK AND SUGGEST THAT MAYBE WE DON'T EITHER IF THIS IS A LINE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO DOWN BUT I URGE AN AYE VOTE. ON SB ONE EIGHTY. THANK YOU MS KAMLAGER DOES. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ADAM CERTAMEN CLOSE WE WISH. WITH THAT. THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. IS THAT ABOUT ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. ALL MEMBERS OF. THE DESIRE TO VOTE. THE CLERK WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT ICE FORTY THREE. DOES ELEVEN. THAT MEASURE PASSES. THIS IS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE. MISTER. CALDERON FOR WHAT PURPOSE SIR YEAH JUST AS A CLIFF ON TALKING POINT NUMBER SEVEN AND REFERRALS TO RULES COMMITTEE JUST TO BE CLEAR- I SAID SB THREE SIXTY NINE I HERTZBERG NOT SB THREE NINETY SIX BUT SB THREE SIXTY NINE HERTZBERG. THE CLERK WILL NOTE. THIS IS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE SB ONE NINETEEN CORPORATE. SENATE BILL ONE NINETEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW AN ACCOLADE THE STATE EMPLOYMENT MAKING AN APPROPRIATION OF FORCE TO CONNECT IMMEDIATELY BE RELATED TO THE BUDGET. MISTER CHENEY AGAIN OFTEN THINK ABOUT SPEAKER SB ONE NINETEEN IS OUR SECOND AMMO YOU TRAILER BILL THE BILL DOES TWO THINGS A RATIFIES THE PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND BARGAINING UNIT TWELVE THE CRAFT A MAINTENANCE WORKERS ARE POLLS BARGAINING UNIT THIRTEEN THE STATIONARY. ENGINEERS RECEPTOR THE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET DEADLINE THE MIX CONFORMING STATUTORY CHANGES TO NINE OF THE BARGAINING UNITS A DENTED BURDEN TO PRIOR JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY TO SISTER WITH A. B. ONE NINE THE FIRST TIME ARE YOU BILL PASSED. IN JUNE THESE MO USE REFLECT THE SAVINGS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ACT. IN CONFORMED ACTIONS WE TOOK IN OUR JUNE PACKAGE I RESPECT FOR YOUR OUT FRONT OF. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE NINETEEN. THIS TRAILER BILL IMPLEMENTS MO USE WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STATE BARGAINING UNITS THAT WILL RESULT. IN MINOR SAVINGS TO THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALSO MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL RESULT. IN POTENTIALLY FAR GREATER LONG TERM LIABILITIES TO THE STATE. THEN THE MINOR SAVINGS THAT WERE REALIZING. I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS THAT THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS A FULL PROGRAM FOR STATE EMPLOYEES BUT UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL FOR WILL PROGRAM. THIS BILL COMPENSATES STATE EMPLOYEES FOR FULLER DAYS BY ADDING THOSE DAYS TO A PERSONAL LEAVE PROGRAM IN THAT EMPLOYEE'S NAME. THE THAT WE BALANCE CAN BE CARRIED FORWARD IN PERPETUITY. AND WHEN IT IS PAID OUT AT THE END OF EMPLOYEES TENURE WITH THE STATE IT'S PAID OUT AT THEIR HIGHEST SALARY NOT AT THE SALARY AT WHICH HE WAS GRANTED. SO THIS IS IN EFFECT NOT A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE BUT A HIGH pINTEREST ALONE AT THAT WE ARE TAKING FROM OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO FINANCE OUR BUDGET DEFICIT THIS YEAR. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING. CAN BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THIS TRAILER BILL SUSPENDS. THE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION FOR POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR A NUMBER OF STATE BARGAINING UNITS. NUMBER REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE A HUGE UNFUNDED STATE LIABILITY. KHLOE RETIREE HEALTH CARE ALONE. WE HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF ABOUT EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. SOSA SPENDING THAT IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY PERSIST IN THE FUTURE. THIS TRAILER BILL WILL RESULT IN RELATIVELY MODEST SAVINGS TO US THIS YEAR ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS MILLION WITH AN M. OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. BUT I FEAR THAT IT WILL CAUSE FAR GREATER HARM TO THE STATE LONG TERM BY INCREASING THOSE LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND CONSEQUENTLY MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR US TO RECOVER. FROM THE ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ON COLLEAGUES I ORIGINAL VOTE. FAMOUS FOR OBERNOLTE SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MR TENNEY MAKE CLOTHES WE WISH. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKER WELL FIRST LET ME JUST TAKE THE TWO BARGAINING UNITS THAT HAVE THEM I USE PROF ORDERED AS WELL AS ALL THE DIFFERENT BARGAINING UNITS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET DEFICIT. WELL WE ASK MANY OF THOSE BARGAINING IT ALL THOSE BARGAINING UNITS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE TO SACRIFICE TO DEFER COMPENSATION TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD TO SCORE THOSE SAVINGS THEY ABSOLUTELY STEPPED UP. BUT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT IN IS A VERY LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR OWN AND- ONE OF THE FOCAL THEM URGE ALL OF YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE COST SAVINGS. THAT WERE CODIFIED IN OUR BUDGET TO REALLY HELP US BRIDGE OUR DEFICIT WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON THIS PEOPLE NINETEEN I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR IMMEDIATE. TRANSMITTAL TO THE SENATE MISTER SPEAKER FOR TO ASK YOU MEDIA TRENDS ON SB ONE EIGHT AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER TANK AND WITH THAT THE- WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS.

COUNTIES WISHING TO PARTICIPATE YOU MAKE A VALID EFFORT TO COMPLY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE PERSONAL WAIVERS FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN 1100% OF THE REQUIRED VOTING SITES OR DROP OFF LOCATIONS. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE OPTIONAL FOR THE COUNTIES.

BEFORE TWENTY THREE ALSO REQUIRE STATE AND VOTER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS. REGARDING THESE NEW PROCEDURES. AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AND SOME OTHER STATES.

THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AS YOU KNOW. MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE WORKED IN A VERY BIPARTISAN. FASHION TO ENSURE A SAFE AND FAIR ELECTION IN NOVEMBER I MUST PART WAYS HOWEVER ON THIS BILL. MY COLLEAGUES. STANDARD VOTING FOR THIS BILL YOU ARE VOTING TO LIMIT VOTING OPTIONS AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. WE HAVE ALREADY ACTED IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN SAFELY VOTE BY MAIL. WELL WE DID THAT A FEW WEEKS BACK RIGHT HERE IN THE IN THESE CHAMBERS THE LEGISLATURE ACTED. AS WE KNEW WE COULD TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS AND WE PROVIDED THAT OPTION COOL. NOT NOW. IF PEOPLE DECIDE NOT TO VOTE BY MAIL. SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT THEY CAN AT LEAST GO IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE OR OTHERWISE SHOULD WE EXPECT THEY CAN AT LEAST GO IF THEY'RE INTO. A REGULAR COUNTY. THAT THEY CAN GO TO THEIR PRECINCT THAT THEY'RE USED TO GOING TO WONDER THIS BILL THAT PRECINCT. MAVOR NOT BE THERE. AND ON DAY OR IF YOU'RE IN A VOTER CHOICE. COUNTY THE YOU WILL HAVE TEN DAYS. TO GO TO A VOTE CNTER TO GET ASSISTANCE OR TO VOTE IN PERSON OR IF THERE'S SOME REASON WHY YOU NEED TO. GET THAT IN PERSON ASSISTANCE. UNDER THE UNDER THE STATUTE ON THE RULES YOU HAVE TEN DAYS TO DO THAT NOW UNDER THIS BILL VERY LIKELY THREE DAYS. FOR YOU TO GO IN THERE AND IN A IN A CODED CRISIS SITUATION. WHEN WE WANT TO PROVIDE AS MANY OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE IN PERSON SO WE DON'T HAVE. CROWDS AT PRECINCTS AND AT BOTH CENTERS UNDER THIS BILL VERY LIKELY WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT- AS WE TAKE THIS MEASURE UP. MOREOVER THIS GOES ALONG WITH THE SAME EXECUTIVE ORDER NONSENSE THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT THERE WHERE HE LEGISLATED INSTEAD OF ALLOWING US AS AS WE'VE ALREADY SHOWN THAT WE CAN DO OPEN THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS JOB AND BASS LAW THE GOVERNOR ONE OUT THERE AND DID IT. BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND THIS JUST CONTINUES TO GO ALONG. WITH THAT PROCESS WHICH IS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS. WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT NO THAT'S THAT'S NOT OKAY. AND WE ALSO NEED TO STAND UP FOR VOTING RIGHTS OPTIONS. FOR OUR CITIZENS WHO MAY VERY WELL NEED TO GO. TO THE PLACE THAT THEY'RE USED TO GOING THERE VOTING PRECINCT A VOTE CENTER. UNDER THIS BILL.

THE REALITY IS THAT WERE TRYING TO OPERATE ELECTION UNDER A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS. THE REALITY IS THAT ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS THEY USED TO OPEN UP THEIR GARAGES FOR POLLING PLACES MIGHT NOT BE COMFORTABLE. OPENING UP THE GARAGE IS FOR POLLING PLACES THIS NUMBER.

A PROXY OR REMOTE VOTING LEGAL WHY DON'T WE DO IT MONTHS AGO SO WE COULD HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS WHOLE TIME. INSTEAD FOR TWELVE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WEEKS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. TWELVE WEEKS IN THE EYES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS RUN THIS CAPITAL. WE DIDN'T MEET IN ANY MANNER AT ALL. WE DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO WHY IS IT THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING THIS NOW WILL ONE ANSWER WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE MAJORITY. WHICH IS THE EIGHT TWENTY FIVE DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THAT WAS THE LAWFUL WAY TO ESTABLISH PROXY VOTING IF WE'RE GONNA DO IT. WAS A REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE SENATE AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE HOUSE RESOLUTION. REQUIRES NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. BY THIS BODY BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE MY WORD FOR. YOU CAN TAKE THE WORD OF THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. HE TOLD THE SACRAMENTO BEE ON APRIL SIXTH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WITH REMOTE VOTING. ON APRIL TWENTY FIFTH. A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE SPEAKER PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING QUOTE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTION NECESSITATES THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF MEMBERS TODAY. AND PROVIDES THE RIGHT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ATTEND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS IN PERSON. THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING OPINION OF OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES PHYSICAL PRESENCE FOR LEGISLATOR VOTING AND THAT POSITION WAS AFFIRMED IN A MAY ELEVENTH OPINION BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. WHICH SAID THAT VIRTUALLY ALL THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACT BY MEANS OF PHYSICALLY CONVENING MEMBERS IN THE SAME PLACE. AT THE SAME TIME. SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE PASS THIS RESOLUTION AND PROCEED WITH PROXY VOTING WELL THAT'S GOING TO CAST A CLOUD. OF UNCERTAINTY OVER EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT WE PASSED BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF SESSION. AND AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT. POLITICO REPORTED ON APRIL THIRTIETH. THAT THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKERS OFFICE. FEELS THERE'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF RISK THE POSSIBILITY OF A LAWSUIT CHARGING THE REMOTE NOTES VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. IF SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR FILED AND PREVAILED RENDON'S OFFICE REASONS LAWS PASSED REMOTELY COULD BE THROWN OUT. AS IF THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY AHEAD OF US IN THE COMING MONTHS. HAVING POTENTIALLY DOZENS OR HUNDREDS OF BILLS WITH AN UNCERTAIN LEGAL STATUS IS SOMETHING OF THAT OUR STATE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD. BUT MY BIGGEST OBJECTION TO THIS PROPOSAL. IS THE PROXY VOTING IS SIMPLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH. REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT AND THIS AGAIN IS PART OF OUR LEGISLATOR COUNCILS MAY ELEVENTH OPINION WHICH STATES NOT ONLY DOES REMOTE LEGISLATING CONTRADICT THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORDS USED IN THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT RUNS COUNTER TO HOW DELIVERED OF BODIES HAVE A STORE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERSTOOD. TO OPERATE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE LEAST REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATURE BY ANY MEASURE IN THE COUNTRY. PROXY VOTING WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS US A DEMOCRACY IN MORE THAN JUST NAME. WHEN YOU HAVE PROXY VOTING THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR DEBATE FOR DELIBERATION TO HAVE YOUR MIND CHANGED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE POINTS OF VIEW THE VOTE. IS PRE COOKED. HERE'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE ACLU SAYS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE TO ASK IF THE CURE IS WORSE THAN THE DISEASE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SUCH DRAMATIC DEPARTURES FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS. AND IS IT WORTH IT. NOW I FEEL FOR THE MEMBERS WHO CANNOT BE WITH US. BECAUSE OF ALL OUR ABILITY TO THIS VIRUS. IT'S A LOSS FOR THEM IT'S A LOS THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT IT IS NO MORE OF THE LOS THEN LEGISLATORS WHO FOR A CENTURY AND A HALF AND HAD TO MISS SESSIONS BECAUSE OF INJURY. ILLNESS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THIRTY SECONDS. AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE VOTES ARE NOT OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY. THEY'RE NOT TRANSFERABLE THEY'RE NOT OURS TO GIVE AWAY THE VOTES ON THAT BOARD DON'T BELONG TO US. THEY BELONG TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA. OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY. WE ARE MERE STANDINGS. BUT THAT REQUIRES US TO ACTUALLY STAND IN AND IF WE DON'T THEN THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY BREAKS DOWN SO I ASK YOU. TO USE THE VOTE THAT'S BEEN ENTRUSTED TO YOU TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THE FIGURES KILEY SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THE HR MISTER CALDERON YOU MAY CLOSE I APPRECIATE MY COMMENT THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLIN I WILL JUST SAY THAT THE COURTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO GOVERN ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND TO ADOPT RULES FOR ITS PROCEEDINGS- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

A WELL KNOWN JEWISH PROPER TEACHERS THE WHOLE WORLD IS A VERY NARROW BRIDGE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO BE AFRAID. OVER THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKABLE LIFE JOHN LEWIS TO CROSS BRIDGES BUILT BRIDGES AND ABOVE ALL CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY WITH UTTER FEARLESSNESS. BORN THE SON OF SHARECROPPERS JOHNLEWIS ASCENDED FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS TO BECOME A HERO IN THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE INSPIRATION TO AMERICA OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND A MORAL COMPASS FOR OUR NATION. AMONG HIS MANY TRIBUTES CONGRESSMAN LEWIS WAS RENOWNED FOR HIS UNSHAKABLE DETERMINATION AND FEARLESSNESS IN THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO MENTOR GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICE IN SERVICE WHAT HE PROBABLY CALLED GOOD TROUBLE. ARRESTED MORE THAN FOUR TIMES DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS AND NUMEROUS TIMES THERE AFTER INCLUDING AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS CONGRESSMAN LEWIS WAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED VICIOUSLY BEAT. OFTEN BY POLICE YEAH HE NEVER HESITATED TO CONTINUE HIS ACTIVISM. NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OLD IN AWARDING HIM THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM PRESIDENT OBAMA OBSERVED GENERATIONS FOR NOW. PARENTS TEACH THEIR CHILDREN WHAT IS MEANT BY COURAGE THE STORY OF JOHN LEWIS WILL COME TO MIND. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY JOHN LEWIS WAS MORE THAN AN INSPIRATION HE WAS OUR FRIEND OUR PARTNER OUR CHAMPION IN THE STAUNCHEST ALLIES FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY CONGRESSMAN LEWIS REFLECTED ABOUT THE KINSHIP HE FELT TOWARDS THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. FOR DURING A CHILD OR HE WITNESSED WHITE SUB KNOWS THE WORD GEO WITH CONTEMPT. QUOTE SPITTING IT OUT LIKE A BAD PIECE OF FOOD. OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFETIME CONGRESSMAN LEWIS A FIRM THAT CAN SHIP THROUGH WORD AND DEED.

FOR MANY IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY JOHN LEWIS WAS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE LOVING KINDNESS IN HUMAN DIGNITY THAT ARE THE HIGHEST CALLING OF JEWISH TRADITION. AS WE MORE CONGRESSMAN LEWIS IT FEELS ESPECIALLY PAINFUL THAT WE WOULD LOSE HIM DURING A MOMENT OF PROFOUND NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT. AS OUR NATION WRESTLES WITH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC DEVASTATING RECESSION AND THE ON RENT UNRELENTING BURDEN OF DEADLY SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND YET IN THIS MOMENT IT SEEMS ESPECIALLY FITTING TO RECALL HIS POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF COURAGE AND FEARLESSNESS IN THE FACE OF SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES. DO NOT GET LOST IN A SEA OF DESPAIR HE WROTE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BE HOPEFUL BE OPTIMISTIC.
