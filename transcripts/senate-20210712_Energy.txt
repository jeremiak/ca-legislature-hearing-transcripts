EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR THREE A BILL RELATING TO CALIFORNIA'S PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. BUT RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. A WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME OR WITH MY OFFICE. EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE IS A NARROW BILL CLAIM TO BUT AIM TO ALLOW COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS FOR CCA'S. TO ACCESS AN EXISTING STATE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES COST RECOVERY FOR RENEWABLE BIO ENERGY ELECTRICITY PROJECTS INCLUDING BIO MONTH MASS AND BIOGAS. EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE EXISTING BIO ENERGY PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR SIMILAR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM WITH THE NEW APPLICANTS AS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED. ALL CCAA PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS UNDER BY- OUT PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT AND COST RECOVERY TERMS AS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR I'LL USE CONTRACTS. THE BILL ADDRESSES P. C. OVERSIGHT EXPLICITLY REQUIRING PARALLEL PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND ONLY ALLOWS PROCUREMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. URRENTLY ONLY I'LL USE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THERE IS AVAILABLE CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER THE TUNER FIFTY MEGAWATTS CAPS SET. IN STATUTE. THIS BILL DOES NOT LIFT THE CAP OR MANDATE ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT OF BIOENERGY. BECAUSE CCA CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING FOR THESE PROJECTS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEIR OWN PROCUREMENT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH STATE POLICY. ADDITIONALLY IN THE CPUS MOST RECENT REVIEW OF THE BOMBING PROGRAM ENERGY DIVISION STAFF RECOMMENDED THE CCA'S AMONG OTHERS BE PERMITTED TO PROCURE AND RECOVER COSTS FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE BY MAIL PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE PRIOR TO THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION CCA SO THIS BILL REFLECTS THE CURRENT PROCUREMENT LANDSCAPE OF THE STATE. BUT BETTER UTILIZING THE BIO MAT PROGRAM A. B. EIGHT FORTY THREE WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES. FOR RESPONSIBLE FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL LAND MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS PROVIDING POTENTIAL RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES FOR MICROGRID.

ADMINISTERED BY THE CPUC THE LIFELINE PROGRAM PROVIDES FREE OR DISCOUNTED PHONE SERVICE TO ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. AT TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOUND THAT 40% OF ELIGIBLE OUT. HOUSEHOLDS WERE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. RECENT FIGURES HAVE INDICATED THAT MORE BENEFICIARIES HAVE ENROLLED TODAY RE CERTIFICATION HOWEVER SEEMS A REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW. THE RENEWAL PROCESS HEAVILY RELIES ON MAILING DOCUMENTS ENROLLEES AND IN TURN REQUIRING CUSTOMERS TO FILL OUT AND MAIL BACK THE DOCUMENTS OR COMPLETE THE PROCESS ONLINE AS A RESULT TOO MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE BENEFIT TO THE TO THIS ARCANE PROCESS. KIND OF LA- ONLY 25% OF CALIFORNIA'S LIFELINE AND WILL RELEASE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS. FURTHER MORE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT DID NOT RENEW NEARLY 60% ARE BACK ON THE PROGRAM WITH ONE YEAR OR ANOTHER WORDS THEY WANT TO BE ON THE PROGRAM BUT THE RENEWAL PROCESS IS TOO BURDENSOME.

THIS BILL IS NOT REALLY HI SPEED INTERNET PLEASE READ SECTION TWO EIGHT ONE B. AS IN BABY OF THIS BILL WHILE THE GOAL OF PROVIDING HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED MULTI UNIT HOUSING COMPLEXES IS A LAUDABLE THIS STILL FALLS FAR SHORT BY ALLOWING ALLOWING PROVIDERS TO USE CHEAP CELL ANTENNAS. WHICH WILL BOTH CAUSE HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS AND WILL FAIL TO DELIVER REAL HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE. THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY HEALTH EFFECTS AND SPEED THIS BILL SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN OR AMENDED TODAY TO REQUIRE THE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE FIBRE OPTIC CABLES INTO EACH APARTMENT. WHICH WILL SOLVE BOTH PROBLEMS INTERNET SPEED HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN ONE TO SIX MEGABITS PER SECOND OF DATA WAS CONSIDERED GOOD INTERNET SPEED TODAY THAT IS VERY SLOW TODAY THIRTY TO ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND IS CONSIDERED HIGH SPEED. IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THE US TREASURY DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED ITS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CORONAVIRUS STATE AND LOCAL PHYSICAL RECOVERY FUNDS. AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR ANY ELIGIBLE PROJECT PROJECT IS IT HAS TO PROVIDE UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND. IF YOU PASS THIS BILL AND IT BECOMES LAW. PROVIDERS WILL MAKE MILLIONS BY USING CHEAP CELL ANTENNAS RESIDENTS WILL SUFFER FROM HEALTH EFFECTS IN INSOMNIA AND YOU WILL HEAR MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SLOW INTERNET SPEED. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT. I URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINE PRINT AMEND THIS BILL OR VOTE IT DOWN TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU YOUR WAY SO AND UNDER I'M FORMER TWO TIME MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBER OF NEVADA CITY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE CLEARLY KNOW REGARDING EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WIRELESS IS CHEAP THIRD RATE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FAR INFERIOR TO FIBER OPTIC OR CABLE SERVICE DIRECTLY TO HOMES. INTO THE STRUCTURE'S NOT RELIABLY FAST NOR SYMMETRIC BROADBAND MUST HAVE THE SAME SPEED DOWN AND UP PER THE DEPARTMENT TREASURIES JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDING% REQUIREMENTS FOR BROADBAND COVERED BY RICH RECOVERY PLANS WHY WAS BOB AND CAN'T MEET THE STANDARD WILL GLASS BE CHECKED AND PC MAGAZINE VERIFIED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIVE G. IS NO FASTER THAN FOUR G. IT'S AN ASYMMETRIC UPLOAD SPEEDS ARE SMALL FRACTION OF THE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS UP AND DOWN ARE REQUIRED FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. ONLY CABLE OR FIBER TO THE HOME CAN DO THIS UNLIKE WIRELESS WHICH IS NOT FUTURE PROOF IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR WIRELESS TO KEEP UP TO THE BANDWIDTH DEMAND FIBER OPTIC CAN CARRY A MILLION TIMES. MORE DATA THAN WIRELESS CAN. TREASURY WORK. QUALIFYING PROJECT MUST DELIVER THE METRICS THEY COULD BE SERVICE AND SENDING. THE BILL SHOULD PROVIDE SOLID SERVICE PUBLIC SAFETY AND PRESERVE THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF ST RATHER THAN PUTTING NEIGHBORHOODS BUT CELL TOWERS. DON'T SHORT CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES. A LOT OF COMPANIES TO COLLECT MONEY AND DELIVER CLEARLY INADEQUATE SERVICE. SUPPORT SYMMETRIC SERVICE THANK YOU YOUR WAY SOUTH AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL AND PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. FIBER. THANK YOU YOUR TIME IS UP THANK YOU- NOW OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY. C. NINE ROOM ONE TWELVE C. NINE WILL GO TO THE LINES PROPOSITION MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE THEM UP. NAME THE AFFILIATION IN OPPOSITION. OR. SEVENTY ONE TWELVE FIVE. PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THE COMMAND AGAIN ONE WITH AN ZERO. AND MISTER CHAIR I SHOW NO COMMENTS COMING THROUGH AT THE TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE I SEE I BELIEVE SO. MIKE IS A PURE GO AHEAD SIR- PARTS PART YES SEARCH FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU HEAR MY NAME THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW I HAVE. BEEN AROUND THIS INSTITUTIONAL LONG TIME. I HAVE YET TO SEE TIM MCCOSKER FROM ALL TO SEE EVERS COME BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT ANYTHING IN. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE APPOINTED IRAN AGAINST FOR MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES AND HE BEAT ME PRETTY GOOD. I HOLD THEM IN THE HIGHEST REGARD. YEAH AND I THINK THAT IS C. N. CENTER PALUMBO WHO WAS A INSTITUTION THIS PLACE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME I STAND WITH THE AUTHOR WILL VOTE FOR THIS MISSION. THE SEARCH ERGO CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I TOO WANT TO THINK THAT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AS WE'RE WORKING ON A MEGA BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE FOR BROADBAND AND YOU'RE THINKING OF THOSE WHO ARE IN OUR PUBLIC HOUSING BEING ABLE TO EXPLICITLY AND SURE THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE CAN GIVE- YOU KNOW KIDS AND PEOPLE LIVING IN PUBLIC HOUSING ALL OF THE WIFI HOT SPOTS AND THAT THE COMPUTERS IN THE DIGITAL LITERACY BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH HAS BEEN DELINEATED BY THE COMEDIAN AND ALICE'S IN WHICH YOU'VE- ACCEPTED I THINK IS GREAT AND IT ONLY COMPLEMENTS THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING- HERE SHORTLY THAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON BY BOTH HOUSES SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD WE NEED TO JUST KEEP PUSHING ON FOR MORE- OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE AUTHOR AS WELL I'VE SPENT TEN YEARS ON THE BOARD OF A NONPROFIT- WANNA CONDAMINE WE HAD TO BRING IT HOME. CAMPAIGN TO- WAR BASICALLY REQUIRE FORMAL BROADBAND ACCESS IN NEW. A FORMER HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. AND THEN HAD TO SHOW. A TRAINER'S PROGRAM WE WOULD TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE TOO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT PAY THEM TO GO TRAIN EVERYONE ELSE IN THERE. AND ACTUALLY HAD A BRONCO BHAMA AND JOHN MCCAIN AS PART OF THAT BRING IT HOME CAMPAIGN. WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU HOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS THIS IS THE FACT WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THIS. PROBLEM WE ALSO HAVE CENTER BRADFORD'S BILL ON THE SAME. TOPIC MIGHT MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS YOU WHO IS THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE. DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF BROADBAND SERVICE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROVIDER IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. OR IS IT MORE CALM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE BROADBAND BECAUSE IT'S EITHER TOO EXPENSIVE. THEY DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER OR THEY NEED DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING. IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FORTY PERCENT. OF THE- INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NO ACCESS- IT'S AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE- THOSE WHO DO HAVE IT. IT'S POORLY CONNECTED- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO LIVE. IN MY DISTRICT. AND YOU LOOK AT A TIME IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING WERE BUILT. THEIR BILL WHICH CENTER BOX SO THE INTERNET. THE SERVICES OR THE CONNECTIVE ITTY CAN EVEN PENETRATE- GETTING THE SIGNAL INTO THE HOME- THEY HAVE BUFFERING DAD'S GOES ON. KIDS INTERNET STARTS AND THEN IT JUST CONTINUES. AND SO IT'S A VARIETY OF ISSUES- AND THAT'S JUST ONLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW ALL OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ACCESS WHATSOEVER- WE TALK ABOUT CHILDREN TRYING TO DISTANCE LEARNING- THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO. THE INTERNET THE BROADBAND- SERVICE AND THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ERADICATE THAT BY MAKING SURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH TECHNOLOGY CAN YOU I MEAN WE HAVE STORIES IN WHICH IN MY DISTRICT. THE KIDS KIDS IN THE FAMILY HAVE NO INTERNET ACCESS- BACK AND GO TO THEIR PARTICULAR HOME SO THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO IN THE GARAGE. AND GET CONNECTED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S CONNECTION AND THAT THOSE ARE STORIES THAT ARE REPEATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND SO THIS BILL IS SEEKING A TO ADDRESS. IS THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM X. SPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING JUST WITH SENATOR. IN SOUTH WAS SAYING- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE. PUT IN PLACE THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE. THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT IS NEEDED. F. AND I PER THAT IN AN- YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW I GUESS QUITE IS. THIS POST I GUESS SEEMS TO FOCUS ON NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. TO PROVIDE FREE SERVICE RATHER THAN TRYING TO SUBSIDIZE SERVICE MAKES TEAM. BROADBAND PROVIDERS AND- I GUESS THAT'S WAS WONDERING YOU KNOW IS THAT THE ISSUE OF THEIRS. SERVICE FOR THE COULD BE SERVICE IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE OR DO WE REALLY NEED TO. BE GIVING GRANTS TO. BUILD ALL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. SURE I THINK WE HAVE MISSED BUT MUCH OF THE TAIL ON THE LINE WHO CAN ADDRESS THAT MORE TECHNICAL. MORE TECHNICALLY FOR ME. GO TO THE FALL LINE WITH MISTER PATEL. HE'S HE'S GONE HE'S HUNG UP OKAY. SO SENATOR THERE ARE WHICH WHICH SPEAKER WHERE YOU- REQUESTING- IT WAS EITHER- EMILY HERNANDEZ OR PATEL. OR OR STEVE PUN TELLER EMMA HERNANDEZ IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE. THERE ARE NO LONGER ON THE LINE OKAY. YEAH YES I AM ON THE LINE OKAY. OF M. HERNANDEZ ON THE LINE. COULD YOU PUT YOUR QUESTION AGAIN. MISTER GIBSON FOUR THIRTY. THE SENATOR COULD POSE A QUESTION I'M SORRY WHAT IS YOUR YOU YOUR YOU CALLED ON HER CELL WHAT WAS IT WHAT YOU WANT HER HE WAS MY QUESTION I THINK HE WAS NOT UNDERSTAND BUT- MISTER GIBSON GO TO GIVE A TECHNICAL RESPONSE. OKAY SO YOU WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN. SURE I COULD THIS THIS BILL SEEMS TO FOCUS ON BUILDING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND- RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZING SERVICE MAKES THIS TEAM. BROADBAND PROVIDERS SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET- EQUITY AND VENTURE PERSPECTIVE IT IS THE ISSUE AGAIN THAT THERE'S NOT. ANY SERVICE AROUND THAT THEN COULD BE SUBSIDIZED OR IS THERE REALLY THE NEED TO BUILD NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN MOST CASES. FOR PUBLIC HOUSING THERE'S A FEW ISSUES- ONE OF THEM WOULD BE THAT SOME OF THE BUILDINGS ARE ON THE OLDER END AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO- WIRY BACK THE WIRED UP IT WASN'T INTENDED TO BE WIRED UP SO THEY NEED SOME INFRASTRUCTURE. OFFERS SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BUILDINGS AND BUT ALSO THE OTHER THING WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A BASIC DIGITAL LITERACY TO THE FOLKS LIVING IN THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY OFTEN OR NOT OFTEN BUT AT TIMES. THEY HAVE SOMETIMES A COMMUNITY SPACE TO PROVIDE THE DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING BUT AT OTHER TIMES THERE IS NO SPACE AND SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO GOLD SOMEWHERE. TO TAKE SOMEBODY'S CLASSES. OUR OUR NOT REQUIRED JUST DON'T HAVE THE CLINICAL- YOUR COMMUNITY THAT MEANS I'M TALKING REALLY BASIC CLASSES LIKE. LEARNING HOW TO YOU KNOW USE THE MOUSE AND HOW TO TURN ON THE COMPUTER. ADULT CLASSES PROVIDE- YOU PROVIDE SOME PROGRAMMING BUT USUALLY ALREADY HAVE TO HAVE THOSE BASIC SKILLS. IN ORDER TO KEEP UP IN THE CLASSES. THREE HOURS IT'S THIS BILL PROVIDES. MONEY BOTH FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FREE. SERVICE AS WELL AS MONEY FOR ADOPTION TRAINING SET RIGHT. I WOULD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE AND- ENTRY. I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD INCLUDE- POTENTIAL COMPUTERS MAYBE A COMPLETE COMPUTER CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN YOUR COMMUNITY IN THEIR BUILDING. IF AT ALL POSSIBLE WHAT. THERE'S THERE SENATOR THREE POINTS TO THIS BILL ONE AS CONNECTIVE ADDING TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THREE LITERACY- MS HERNANDEZ TOUCHED UPON THE DELIVERY OF THE LITERACY PART SO THIS BILL WILL IN FACT SPEAK TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE A FACILITY OR- HOUSINGS- THAT DON'T HAVE THE- INFRASTRUCTURE TO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT SUCH TECH THE CORRECT NEGATIVITY THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S THREE MAIN POINTS THE CONNECTIVITY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE LITERACY- THAT ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S EMBEDDED IN FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE. WE'LL GO NOW TO SENATOR RUBIO. HEY DON'T. TAKE A GUESS AT ONE MORE FOLLOW UP JUST. SO THAT'S HELPFUL I PRETEND I AGREE AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT HOLISTIC APPROACH RIGHT IT WAS A CLEAR ON THAT ADOPTION SPENDING SO THAT'S EXCELLENT I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION IS JUST HOW DOES THIS ALIGN WITH THE SPEEDS OF THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT BOTH HOUSES ARE WORKING ON IT IS ALIGNED WITH THE- WITH THE- THE INTENDED SPEEDS OF THOSE. OF THOSE LEGISLATION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGETARY BILL. I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. YEAH THE- THE BUDGET TRAILER BILLS WELL THE WELL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BUT IT'S REALLY BUILT THE LOOK LIKE- WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING UP ON THURSDAY AND HIS BILLS BEFORE US RIGHT NOW AND SO- WE'RE OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO GET THIS BILL ACROSS THE FINISH LINE- HOPEFULLY WE CAN- THEY'LL BE WORK. THAT IS NEEDED THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT WILL SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THE BIGGEST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED. AND SO WE HOPE THAT IT IS CAPTURED- THE INTENT OF THIS BILL OF FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BILL WE ARE WAITING FOR THE LANGUAGE. AND I COULD HAVE BEEN SOME GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BRACKET TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL ALIGNS. WITH WHAT'S IN THE BOOK BUT YOU TRAILER BILL BECAUSE THIS GETS TO FINAL. OF THE FINAL SERVICE END OF IT AND SO THIS THIS BILL. GENERALLY WOULD CONFORM AND IF THERE ARE ANY TECHNICAL MATTERS I'M SURE WE CAN. READDRESS SOS. I SHOULD ANYONE IDENTIFY HOW CONFLICT BUT I. DON'T THERE DOESN'T IT. MECHANICALLY SPEAKING IN THE DOZENS BEING SEEN TO BE CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS BILL AND THE BUDGET. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR COMING FORWARD I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES- FIRST OF ALL AND I THINK- FOR ALSO- THINKING ABOUT THE LITERACY PART WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES I KNOW HIS COMMUNITY WELL AND I'VE WALKED IT AND I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WE DON'T FORGET. EVERY QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT HIM AND AS ALREADY STATED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE YOU KNOW BEING PART OF THE BROADER PICTURE TO ACHIEVE PROP AND FOR ALL ESPECIALLY IN BOTH HOUSES AND I THINK THAT THIS COMPLEMENTS OUR EFFORTS VERY WELL SO WITH THAT I WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU.
