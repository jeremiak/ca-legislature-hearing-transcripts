PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.564
THIS I JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.066
BRIEF COMMENTS REGARDING IT. IT

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.768
IS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE DONE

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.569
LEGISLATIVE WORK CONTINUOUSLY

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:07.771
FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS MY WHOLE

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:10.340
FIELD HAS BEEN INSURANCE- WHAT I

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:13.009
CAN TELL YOU IS IN THE NINETEEN

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:13.943
SEVENTIES. THERE WERE TWO

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.845
PROMINENT TYPES OF LITIGATION

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:16.780
AFFECTED THE INSURANCE SECTOR

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:19.215
WHAT THE PROPERTY CASUALTY SIDE

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:20.717
ON ON THE- HEALTH INSURANCE SIDE

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:23.353
. MICHAEL WAS AN EFFORT TO CUT A

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.688
DEAL WITH. RACINE LITIGATION

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.790
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE SIDE HEALTH

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.526
INSURANCE. INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:31.661
THE MARKET. RESERVE THE TYPE A

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:34.330
LAWSUIT ALSO COMING OF THAT TIME

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:34.998
THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED. GOSH THE

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.499
SPAN OF A DECADE CERTAIN

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.902
INSURANCE COSTS INCREASED ALMOST

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:41.037
DOUBLE. VERY REMARKABLE. SO

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.539
THERE'S TWO THINGS HAPPEN THE

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:45.875
SEVENTIES ONE WAS ADDRESSED BY

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.310
THE MICROSCOPIC VICE. AND BUT

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:48.845
YOU SAW THIS EXAMPLE OF HOW

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:50.513
THINGS GO THROUGH THE ROOF IT

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.282
AFFECTS THE COST AND ACCESS WHAT

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:55.452
IS STRIKING. AND VERY IMPORTANT

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:58.488
ABOUT THIS BILL. IS IT RE OPENS

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:01.491
THE ABILITY TO PURSUE ISSUES OF

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:04.894
CONTESTED MEDICAL CARE. ARE VERY

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.596
VERY IMPORTED OPENS THE DOOR FOR

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.465
THAT SORT OF THING AT THE SAME

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.966
TIME IT PUT SOME BOUNDARIES ON

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:12.402
IT SO IT WILL NOT OVERWHELM THE

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:15.905
SYSTEM WITH COSTS SO THIS IS

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.774
REALLY A TREMENDOUS BREAKTHROUGH

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:19.843
. IT RE OPENS THE DOOR OF THE

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:20.610
COURTHOUSE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.545
ACTIONS BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:23.713
BALANCED IN A WAY TO PRESERVE

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.615
LONG TERM ACCES TO MEDICAL CARE

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:28.351
WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:29.419
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES- IN

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:33.089
CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THIS IS.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:36.226
A VERY VERY STRIKING SOUND

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:38.728
INNOVATIVE RESPONSE. TO A

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:42.332
PROBLEM. THAT YOU HAD A BAD

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.500
SOLUTION WOULD ACTUALLY. HURT

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.135
LONG TERM ACCESS TO MEDICAL

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:48.071
CARE. I THINK IT IS A- AS I SAY

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.740
AN EXCELLENT BALANCED RESPONSE

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:55.178
INTERGIRO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.379

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.483
SUPPORT OF THIS SAYS THAT AS

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.385
SOMEONE WHO PRACTICED DENTISTRY

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:04.154
FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AND

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.222
STILL ACTUALLY CARRY MALPRACTICE

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.892
INSURANCE FOR THE WORK I DO- IN

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.460
FORENSIC CONSULTING THIS IS

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.762
HISTORIC- YOU NEED TO DO YOU DO

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:13.763
NEED TO REMEMBER AND REFLECT

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.765
BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.200
WHEN SKYROCKETING MALPRACTICE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:18.601
PREMIUMS WERE THREATENING TO

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:20.303
DRIVE PROVIDERS OUT OF THE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.740
STATE. AND THIS STABILIZE THAT-

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:26.009
AND UNFORTUNATELY SET UP A FORTY

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.011
SEVEN YEAR BATTLE- TO CHANGE IT

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:28.945
I THINK THE CHANGES ARE

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.713
APPROPRIATE I THINK THEY'RE FAIR

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.482
THEIR FAIR FOR PATIENCE I THINK

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.616
THEY'RE FAIR FOR PROVIDERS AND

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:35.485
ACTUARIAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN I

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.620
BELIEVE. IN THE BACKGROUND THAT

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.489
THIS ISN'T REALLY GOING TO

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.723
AFFECT THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.659

SKYROCKETED- THOSE ARE OTHER

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:52.702
THINGS WE NEED TO MEET NEED TO

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.003
BE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE OF A

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.140
CRISIS. AND HOW WE RESPOND TO

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:57.874
THOSE- WILL- POTENTIALLY BE TIE
