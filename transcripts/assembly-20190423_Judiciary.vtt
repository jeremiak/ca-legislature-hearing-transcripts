00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.512
THE BIAS IS THE UNCONSCIOUS AND

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.214
UNINTENTIONAL MENTAL SHORT CUT

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.616
THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN DEVELOP

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.151
AND IT AFFECTS US ALL.

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.120
IT IS OFTEN SUBTLE ASSOCIATIONS

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:11.055
WE MAKE BETWEEN GROUPS OF PEOPLE

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.456

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:13.758
GROUPS.

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.726
WE KNOW THAT EXPLICIT BIAS

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:18.729
PERSISTS LIKE RACISM SEXISM AND

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.631
OTHER FORMS OF BIGOTRY AND AS A

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.366

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:24.001
LAWS ARE IN PLACE TO HELP CHECK

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.002
THOSE.

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:26.937
MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO BE FREE

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.606

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:31.075
STEREOTYPES THAT LEAD US TO

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:31.976
JUDGE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SOCIAL

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.311
CATEGORIES THEY BELONG TO SUCH

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.580
AS RACE OR GENDER OR SEXUAL

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:37.982
ORIENTATION.

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.583
HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.218
COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.787
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.755
UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIAS

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:47.324
THESE AND THOSE ARE EQUALLY

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:48.325
IMPACTFUL.

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.494
DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.729
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT

SUBJECTS CAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:56.000
IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.436
AND YET ON TESTS THAT MEASURE

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.438
SUBCONSCIOUS TENDENCIES STILL

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.339

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.175
ON STEREO TYPES TO FILL IN THE

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.077
BLANKS ABOUT PEOPLE THEY DON'T

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.244
KNOW.

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.413
IT IS CRITICAL THAT ATTORNEYS

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.915

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.750

DEMONSTRATED THAT JUDGES POSSESS

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.961
THE SAME LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS

EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.382
THAT PROSECUTORS ARE MORE LIKELY

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.050
TO CHARGE BLACK SUSPECTS THAN

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.518
WHITE SUSPECTS IN SIMILAR

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.187
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:44.621
SO WHEN LEFT UNADDRESSED THE

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:47.524
IMPLICIT BIASES OF JUDGES CLERKS

00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:49.226
AND ATTORNEYS CONTRIBUTES TO AN

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:52.296
UNACCEPTABLE RACIAL DISPARITY IN

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:53.931
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:56.266
IN SAN FRANCISCO LOCALLY BLACK

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.469
DEFENDANTS ARE HELD IN PRE TRIAL

00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:01.138
CUSTODY 62% LONGER THAN WHITE

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.006
DEFENDANTS.

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:04.375
AND BLACK DEFENDANTS RECEIVED

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.443
28% LONGER SENTENCES THAN WHITE

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.645
DEFENDANTS CONVICTED CONVICTED

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:09.813
OF THE SAME CRIME.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.348
AND NATIONALLY JUDGES SET BAIL

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:14.451
AMOUNTS OF BLACK MEN 35% HIGHER

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.153
THAN FOR WHITE MEN AND FOR LET

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.455
LATINO MEN 19% HIGHER THAN FOR

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:19.390
WHITE MEN.

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:21.725
SO SINCE BIAS IS LEARNED OVER

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:22.793
THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME IT'S

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.928
NOT EASILY -- LEARN BUT THE GOOD

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.765
NEWS IS THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:31.402
CHANGE AND BIAS CAN BE MANAGED

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.037
THROUGH COUNTER BIAS TRAINING.

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.172
PRACTICAL TOOLS CAN HELP

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:36.306
PARTICIPANTS UNLEARNED

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:38.275
STEREOTYPES AND RETRAIN THEIR

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.811
BRAIN TO DISRUPT STEREO TYPE

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:43.113
BASS IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.715
COUNTERBALANCED COUNTER BIAS

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.517
TRAINING CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:49.586
WHEN ITS ONGOING AND REOCCURRING.

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:50.087
THE OTHER THING IS THAT

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:52.022
STRESSFUL WORKING ENVIRONMENT

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.290
STIMULATE BIAS.

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.858
AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO DO THE

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.427
HARD WORK OF DISRUPTING THEIR

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:58.962
BIAS BUT INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.564
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AS WELL.

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.865
INSTITUTIONS NEED TO CREATE

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.667
POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.502
STRUCTURES.

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:06.937
THAT DE STRESS THE WORK FORCE

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.906
AND ALLOW PROFESSIONALS TIME TO

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.374
MAKE CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.575
DECISIONS.

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.510
DELIBERATE THOUGHTFUL DECISION

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:18.615
MAKING IS THE KEY TO DISRUPTING.

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.384
FIVE I'VE OBSERVED I DO NEED YOU

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.052
TO WRAP UP OKAY.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.020
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE BODY

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:24.788
POLITIC SHARE VALUES OF FAIRNESS

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:27.024
EQUITY AND JUSTICE.

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:27.991
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.694
THAT STRIVE TO ELIMINATE BIAS.

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.463
IN INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.231
TAKES US ONE GIANT LEAP TOWARD

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:35.699
THAT MORE PERFECT UNION THANK

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.568
YOU.

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.970
THANK YOU NEXT WITH US PLEASE.

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:41.538
GOOD MORNING.

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:42.806
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:45.008
MEDIAN CHAIR -- I'M PLEASED TO

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.076
BE HERE.

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.811
THE CONVERSATION THAT IF WE

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:49.680
COULD JUST ASSUME ARGUENDO FOR

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.914
THE PURPOSES OF CONVERSATION

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.816
THAT BIAS EXISTS AND THAT IT

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.651
AFFECTS DECISION MAKING -- ON

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:57.054
THE BENCH AND BEYOND -- THEN WE

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:58.822
GET TO EXPLORE THE QUESTION OF

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:01.358
THE VALUE OF TRAINING.

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:04.328
OF MAKE WILL IT SIMPLY BE A

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.696
MOMENT OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.064
COMING TOGETHER NETWORKING OR

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.398
WILL IT ACTUALLY MAKE A

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.500
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:10.701
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS.

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.269
BUCKLEY THE NEUROSCIENCE THAT IS

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.538
AVAILABLE -- GIVES US INSIGHT

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.539
INTO THAT.

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.773
EFFECT WAS NEUROSCIENCE THE HELP

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.442
THE FIRST OPEN THE DOOR. TO HELP

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:19.977
US UNDERSTAND HOW BIAS ACTUALLY

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.345
MANIFEST ITSELF.

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.447
IF WE HAVE A DIFFERENT BRAIN

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.116
REACTION TO A FACE A NAME A

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.317
VOICE.

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:28.185
WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:30.254
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THOSE

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.688
INDIVIDUALS IN A COURT OF LAW --

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:32.756
THE WONDERFUL THING IS THAT THE

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:33.790
TECHNOLOGY IN THE NATURAL

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.259
SCIENCES ACTUALLY LET US KNOW

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.793
HOW TO CHANGE THOSE BRING

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.861
REACTIONS.

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.596
CUES CAN BE UTILIZED THAT WILL

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.732
LOWER OUR LEVEL OF THREAT

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.767
REACTION WHEN WE SEE INDIVIDUALS

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:46.470
WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE APPEAR FIGHT

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:48.805
MEAN THREATENING PERHAPS JUST

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:49.873
INDIVIDUALS WHO.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.108
WHEN CONSIDERING THE OPTION OF

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.177
INCARCERATION WE SAY WE NEED TO

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:54.144
PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THEM AND

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:55.646
AND THEREFORE PERHAPS PLACE THEM

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:58.081
IN INCARCERATION? FOR A LONGER

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.516
PERIOD OF TIME [inaudible]

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.784
ADDITIONALLY.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.419
NEUROSCIENCE HELPS US UNDERSTAND

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:05.989
WHAT PRECISELY A JUDGE COULD DO.

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.658
IN APPLYING LAW TO FACT. TO MAKE

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.893
A FAIR DECISION EVEN IN THE FACE

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.228
OF IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:12.596
ASSUMING THAT IMPLICIT BIAS

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.332
EXIST IN THE MIND OR THE BRAIN

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:16.867
OF THAT JUDGE AT THAT TIME.

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.669
CAN WE ACTUALLY TRAIN A JUDGE TO

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:20.037
MAKE A FAIR DECISION BY

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.939
ACTIVATING PARTICULAR PARTS OF

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.507
THE NEUROANATOMY AND SUBSYSTEMS

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.542
THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE A

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.578
DECISION THAT'S REALLY ABOUT THE

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:28.212
FACTS AND THE LAW.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:30.247
AND THE ANSWER IS YES WE HAVE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:31.748
THAT AVAILABLE TO US AND THEY

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.417
DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLYHAVE

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:35.085
THEIR BRAIN SCANNED IN THEY

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:36.353
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER NEURO

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.121
BIOLOGY CLASS OR THEIR FIRST ONE

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.056
PERHAPS.

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.457
IT ALL BECOMES A PART OF A

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.259
PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN A

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:43.827
CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT.

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:45.829
OF THE MORE THAT WE DO THE MORE

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:48.332
CONTROL THE JUDGE HAS AND QUIRK

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:49.566
STAFF HAVE OVER THEIR BRAINS.

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.101
MANY OF CONTROL OF THEIR BRAINS

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:54.338
ABOUT CONTROL THEIR COURT.

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.039
AND THEN WE HAVE A FAIR.

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.007
SHERRI AND IN THE JUDITH PROCESS

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.642
THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO THE

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.544
OUTCOMES WERE HOPING.

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.512
FOR SO I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT.

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:04.448
TRAINING IS MORE THAN HOLDING

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.683
HANDS SINGING KUMBAYA.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.653
BUT RATHER IMPLEMENTING SPECIFIC

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.355

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.856
ENSURE THE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.959
OF THE COURTS.

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.848
TEMPORARY JUDGE WE HAD TO GO

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.216
THROUGH TRAINING?

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:21.351

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.452
BIAS.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.187

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.958
IT IS THERE.

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.559
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.061
ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND THEN TO

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.496
FIGURE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:33.497
CHANGE IT.

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:35.432
BECAUSE IF YOU JUST TO GLOSS

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.634
OVER AND SAY I HAVE NO BIAS AYE.

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.770
I GREW UP IN A SOCIETY WHERE I

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.605
EVERYBODY IS EQUAL.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.640
IT THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT WHEN YOU

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.108
TAKE THOSE LITTLE TESTS AND YOU

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:47.043
FIND THAT THERE IS AN IMPLICIT

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.612
BIAS YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:49.646

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.364
QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU AS YOU

00:51:26.149 --> 00:51:27.284
ONE AWARENESS.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.852
STEP ONE ADMIT YOU HAVE A

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.821
PROBLEM BASICALLY SO IT IS

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.322
IMPORTANT FOR A PERSON TO BE

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.924
AWARE BUT THAT WHILE IS IT IS

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.659
NECESSARY IS ABSOLUTELY

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:36.827
INSUFFICIENT.

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:38.995
IT'S PART ONE BUT YOU GOTTA GO

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.297
TO THE NEXT STEP THEN ONCE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:41.398
EVERYONE GETS TO THE POINT OF

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.533
SAYING YES INDEED WE HAVE A BIAS.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.835
NOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.236
START UTILIZED TOOLS AND THE

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.504
TOOL SHOULD COVER AT LEAST THREE

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.573
CATEGORIES ONE REDUCING THE

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:51.174
LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH WE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.742
KNOW CAN BE DONE.

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.177
THAT THERE IS OUR ACTUAL

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.378
CURRICULA AVAILABLE THAT WILL

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.980
ACTUALLY BRING DOWN YOUR LEVEL

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:58.882
OF IMPLICIT BIAS ON THE I. A. T.

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.650
IN ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY.

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:02.419
SO THAT'S PART.

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.254
ONE PART TWO PROVIDING THAT'S

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.121
WHAT THAT'S LONG TERM

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.656
MAINTENANCE PART TO PROVIDING

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.226
PEOPLE WITH INSTANTANEOUS ACCESS

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.594
TO BRING DOWN THE DIFFERENT

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.929
NARAL PHYSIOLOGIC REACTIONS THAT

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.631
CAN CREATE PROBLEMATIC DECISION

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.332
MAKING.

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:16.666
THE SPIDER SNAKE REACTION THAT

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.168
WE HAVE IN OUR BRAIN WE CAN

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.202
ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE TWO OTHER

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:20.637
INDIVIDUALS WHO WE'VE BEEN TOLD

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:21.938
OVER LIFE TIME OR THE SCARY

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.340
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:24.608
INCARCERATED LONGER.

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:25.675
FIRST A SHORT OF FOR SHORTER

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:27.611
PERIODS OF TIME AND NUMBER THREE

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.246
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.881
TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO ACTIVATE.

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.115
THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THEIR

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:33.316
NEUROANATOMY THE ENTER YOUR

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.452
SINGLE CORTEX TO BE SPECIFIC BUT

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:36.486
NOT TO MAKE EVERYBODY'S EYES

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.955
GLAZE OVER BUT TO PROTECT THE

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:39.523
THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THEIR

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:40.657
NEUROANATOMY.

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:41.758
THAT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.594
MAKE FAIR AND ACCURATE DECISIONS

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.496
EVEN WALL BIAS IS EXT IS

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.265
ACTUALLY ACTIVE IN THEIR BRAIN

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.700
AND IN THEIR PSYCHE SO TO SPEAK.

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:51.368
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.702
COMPONENTS FOR PART TO THE

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.704
SOLUTION SECTION AND PART ONE IS

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.339

THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:38.188

THE THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH

US IN AND TRYING TO NARROW THE

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.959
SCOPE OF THE BILL -- AT THIS

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:44.327
TIME WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S A

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.695
LITTLE TOO BROAD AND WILL

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.964
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO US KEEPING.

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:50.366
EVERY EMAIL THAT WE HAVE -- FOR

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:52.936
TWO YEARS AND AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:56.272
IN A THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:58.141
REQUIRE ANY NEW DISCLOSURES.

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.943
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE -- PROVIDE

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.278
ANY NEW EXEMPTIONS -- THIS IS A

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:04.480
DATA STORAGE BILL THIS IS A WE

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.683
HAVE TO KEEP -- THESE EMAILS AND

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.585
AND THAT WOULD BE -- MEN EMAIL

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:11.287
CHAIN WHERE YOU'VE GOT IN A

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:12.388
FIFTEEN PEOPLE RESPONDING TO AN

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.557
EMAIL IT'S NOT THE LAST EMAIL

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.125
THAT HAS THE RECORD OF ALL OF

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:17.427
THE EMAILS THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP.

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:19.128
IT ALL OF THE FIFTEEN RESPONSES

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:20.029
AS WELL.

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.598
AND SO WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.700
IS COST ARE A PUBLIC AGENCIES

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.268
MORE MONEY AS FAR AS THE THE

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:26.603
DATA STORAGE NOW.

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.971
HI I APPRECIATE WHAT THE

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.239
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS GETTING AT

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.340
AND I THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.108
TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND FIND

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:34.143
SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION. ONE OF

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.612
THE OTHER ISSUES IS THIS --

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.714
RETENTION REQUIREMENT AS POINTED

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.816
OUT THE ANALYSIS IS IN THE

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.484
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.219
RATHER THAN ANOTHER SECTION THE

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:43.887
GOVERNMENT CODE.

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:45.321
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT DOES

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:46.389
IS THAT CIRCUMVENTS THE

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.157
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS FOR PUBLIC

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:49.659
AGENCIES THERE'S NO OTHER

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:50.894
RETENTION REQUIREMENTS.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.395
IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS

ACT THEIR OTHER PLACES IN THE

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.265
GOVERNMENT CODE AND SO WE WOULD

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.766
SUGGEST THAT THIS IF IF IT'S

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.201
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD BE MOVED

INTO THE GOVERNMENT COAT -- AND

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:03.539
HOPEFULLY THAT THAT WILL ALLOW

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:04.774
OUR AGENCIES THAT DO EXPERIENCE

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.576
CERTAIN COSTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.685
NOTION OF OF WANTING TO USE

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.854
TECHNOLOGY TO REPLACE.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:12.989
TRADITIONS AND AND LEGAL

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.223
STRUCTURE THEY'VE BEEN BUILT UP

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.825
OVER THE YEARS IN PAPER AND I'LL

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.393
TELL YOU FOR ONE I AM VERY

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.462
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:20.296
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:20.596
[inaudible]

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.098
PAPER.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.233
INTO ELECTRONICS AND AS WE DO

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.568
THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.502
PROTECTING.

DO TO MAKE SURE WE DO.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.078
SO THAT THE SYSTEM HAS A WAY TO

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.114
TO MANAGE SO I I THINK THIS IS A

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.482
VERY GOOD ISSUE I WANNA MAKE

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.050

PRESERVING THE EVIDENCE

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.394
PRESERVING THE STRUCTURE.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.296
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE CONCERN

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.897

KEEPING NON DISPERSIBLE WIPES

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.327
OUT OF THE SEWER SYSTEM.

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:39.061
BOB.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.963
THIS IS TOILET PAPER THAT WAS

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.732
PLACED IN THIS JAR THIS MORNING

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:45.134
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S ALREADY

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.836
DISSOLVED INTO SMALL PIECES.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:50.005
THIS IS -- PERMISSION TO USE

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.274

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.646
THIS MISTER CHAIR -- THIS THIS

01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:01.183

YOU CAN SEE IT'S STILL IN ONE

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:03.986
PIECE THIS WOULD PLACE THE JAR

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.921
BACK IN FEBRUARY THE BEGINNING

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.224
OF FEBRUARY OF OF OF THIS YEAR

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:10.226
AND THAT IN CAPSULE IT'S THE

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.228
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:12.661
ADDRESS HERE WITH.

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.029
WITH THIS BILL.

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.097
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS RIGHT

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.966
NOW ANY COMPANY CAN CALL THEIR

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.268
PRODUCT FLUSHABLE REGARDLESS OF

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.003
THE POTENTIAL HARM TO THE SEWER

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.805
SYSTEM OR WHETHER IT.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.108
TRULY BREAKS APART -- OF LIKE

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:26.876
TOILET PAPER DOES.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:29.145
WHEN AND WHAT WHITE PRODUCTS ARE

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.479
FLUSHED INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.847
THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.716
ISSUES FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.050
OWNERS SEWER COLLECTIONS AND

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.819
WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS AND IN

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.188
FACT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:39.422
SEEING?

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.457
OUT IN THE FIELD A SINGLE USE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.259
WET WIPES ARE HEAVIER THICKER

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.326
AND HAVE LARGER SURFACE AREAS

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.861
THAN TOILET PAPER AND

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.196
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:49.465
UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WHITE.

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:50.900
MAINTAIN MOST OF THEIR STRENGTH

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.034
AS THEY ARE COMPOSED OF

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.370
SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT RETAIN

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.571
THEIR SHAPE AND STRENGTH.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:58.474
THEY OFTEN DO NOT BREAK DOWN --

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.875
FOR A LONG LONG TIME AFTER BEING

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:02.611
FLUSHED AND CAN ACCUMULATE WITH

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.180
FATS OILS AND GREASE.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.048
THAT BECOME LARGE OBSTRUCTIONS

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:07.683
IN OUR PIPES AND TO HAVE EARNED

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.687
THE DISGUSTING NAME OF FAT BERKS --

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.355
FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THEY WEAVE

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.291
TOGETHER AND THEY CAN CREATE

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:20.329
GIANT RAGS -- THAT -- THEN CAN'T

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.897
CATCH IN OUR PUMP SYSTEMS

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.899
COLLECTION SYSTEMS AND MOTORS

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.434
CAUSING BACKUPS AND EQUIPMENT

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.670
FAILURES AND THIS IN FACT IS A

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:28.871
PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.940
EXPERIENCED ACROSS THE STATE.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.808
I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES IN

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:35.144
PETALUMA AN ORANGE COUNTY -- IN

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.545
THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.615
DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF CAMERI --

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:40.916
A WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT IT

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.818
HAS INVESTED A HALF MILLION

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.153
DOLLARS TO UPGRADE ITS WASTE

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.492
WATER TREATMENT PLANT JUST TO

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:50.693
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:51.894
IN EACH OF THESE CASES THE COST

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.362
GETS PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:54.296
NOT THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.698
WHITES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.733
DAMAGING THE SYSTEMS AND SO THIS

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.202
BILL SIMPLY PRESCRIBES CLEAR AND

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.638
CONSISTENT CONSUMER MESSAGING.

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.406
FOR THESE PRODUCTS SO THAT

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:07.042
CONSUMERS LEARN WHAT GOES DOWN

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.012
THE TOILET AND WHAT DOESN'T --

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:12.815
AND THESE SHOULD NOT BE FLUSHED

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.583
DOWN THE TOILET IT'S IT'S THAT

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.218
SIMPLE SO UNDER THE PROVISIONS

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:17.920
OF THE BILL WIFE CAN BE LABELED

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.989
AS FLUSHABLE IF THE IF THEY DO

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:21.857
NOT CAUSE HARM TO THE SEWER

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:22.224
SYSTEM.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:24.460
MEANING THAT MANUFACTURERS WILL

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.594
NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.062
WIVES CAN BREAK DOWN OF THE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.163
SEWER SYSTEM MUCH LIKE TRY

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:31.600
TOILET PAPER FOR ALL OTHER WIPES

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.368
THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.035
FLUSHED.

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.504
FELT BE MARKED DO NOT FLUSH IT'S

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.873
VERY SIMPLE IT'S VERY LOGICAL.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.408
AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.610
BILL IS JESSICA GALLAGHER WITH

ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:55.024
AGENCIES WERE THE SPONSOR BABY

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:55.624
SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO HERE TODAY

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.559
AND STRONG SUPPORT.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.060
SINGLE USE WET WIPES THE BECOME

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:59.395
WIDELY AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.796
OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.164
YEARS AND THERE'S A DIRECT

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.299
CORRELATION WITH THE INCREASING

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.000
POPULARITY.

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.101
OF SINGLE USE WIPES PRODUCTS IN

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.236
THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WE'RE

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.804
SEEING IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WITH

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.572
RAGGING.

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:11.373
SOME MORE -- WIPES ARE MARKETED

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.841
AS FLUSHABLE OTHERS ARE LABELED

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.843
WITH DO NOT FLUSH DIRECTIONS OR

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.412
NOT LABELED WITH ANY DISPOSAL

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:17.947
INDICATIONS AT ALL.

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:19.415
BECAUSE OF THIS INCONSISTENCY IN

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:20.883
LABELING PRACTICES AND BECAUSE

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.451
MOST OF THESE WIPES LOOK AND

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:24.119
FEEL THE SAME.

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:25.354
THE RESULT IS AN ONSLAUGHT OF

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.322
WHITE SEEING FLUSHED DOWN THE

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.023
DRAIN -- BOTH WIPES THAT ARE

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.959
LABELED AS POSSIBLE IN THE ART

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.493
AND THE CAUSING MAJOR ISSUES.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.295
FOR SEWER SERVICE PROVIDERS --

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:35.130
ONE WIPES GET INTO THE SYSTEM

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.466
THEY WEAVE TOGETHER -- INFORMED

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.934
LARGE BLANKETS AND WHEN THEY

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.270
CATCH ON TO OTHER DEBRIS AND

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.172
GREECE THEY FORM FAT BERKS.

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:45.140
AND THESE ARE GIANT OBSTRUCTIONS

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.775
THAT ARE MAJORLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:47.810
THE SYSTEM THINKING COST

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:50.079
SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:55.517
A SEWER SPILL OF ANY AMOUNT --

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:56.118
IS A PUBLIC AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.453
HAZARD AND THE WATER BOARD HAS A

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.020
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FIRST

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:58.854
BILLS.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.656
SO FAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:01.690
WATER BOARD'S BILL DATABASE

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.692
INDICATES THAT THERE BEEN AT

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.194
EIGHTY SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.895
ATTRIBUTED TO RAGGING AND NON

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:07.896
DISPERSIBLE.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.732
THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS --

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:11.800
IN THIS YEAR ALONE THIRTY FIVE

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:12.835
THOUSAND OF WHICH REACH SURFACE

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.903
WATERS AND WERE SUBJECT TO

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.238
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:17.506
AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T ACCOUNT

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:18.641
FOR THE OVERFLOW THAT PRIVATE

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.409
RESIDENCES OR BUSINESSES THAT GO

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.411
UNREPORTED.

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.646
IN ADDITION TO OVERFLOWS ONE

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:24.446
WIFE GET FURTHER DOWN IN THE

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.281
SYSTEMS LARGE RAGS GET WRAPPED

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:28.017
UP IN HEAVY MECHANICAL FEATURES

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.418
OF THE SYSTEMS LIKE PUMPS.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:31.220
MOTORS AND SCREENS REQUIRING

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:32.888
MANUAL REMOVAL OF DEBRIS AND

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.156
ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE OR

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.758
REPLACEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.092
ON THE CONSTANT REMEDIATION

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.261
EFFORTS TO DISRUPT ALL STAGES OF

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.163
TREATMENT THE TREATMENT PROCESS

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:43.432
AND AS A RESULT -- AT RESULTING

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.334
COSTS ON MANY LEVELS FOR PUBLIC

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.102
AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY ON

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.971
REPAIRS -- ALSO WANT TO POINT

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.539
OUT MANY WIPES LIKE BABY WIPES

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.674
AND CLEANING WIPES ARE MADE OF

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.075
PLASTIC AND WHEN THEIR FLESH

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.444
IMPROPERLY THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.813
TO LOADING MY IN WASTEWATER

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.515
EFFLUENT -- THERE SIGNIFICANT

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.283
TIME ENERGY ND PUBLIC MONEY

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.751
BEING SPENT ON MASSIVE PUBLIC

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.319
EDUCATION EFFORTS ABOUT THE

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.754
PROBLEMS WITH FLUSHING WIPES.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:06.989
PRETTY MUCH EVERY AGENCY HAS

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.590
DONE OUT REACH ABOUT WIPES FOR

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:09.858
MANY YEARS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.460
BECAUSE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.095
SIMPLY AREN'T EFFECTIVE ENOUGH

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.496
AND MANAGING THIS PROBLEM.

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:15.931
WE RECENTLY DID SOME POLLING ON

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.332
THIS ISSUE IN THE BAY AREA AND

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:18.934
BY A LARGE MARGIN IT WAS EVIDENT

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.469
THAT CONSUMERS TRUST THE

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:21.937
LABELING ON PACKAGES.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.305
AND THAT'S THE PREFERRED METHOD

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:25.107
FOR RECEIVING INFORMATION ABOUT

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:25.641
PROPER DISPOSAL OF THESE

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:26.408
PRODUCTS.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.310
FAR AND ABOVE HEARING ABOUT IT

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:30.145
FROM THEIR LOCAL SEWER UTILITY.

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.213
ON THE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR

FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL ARE

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.649

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:39.788
LESS TURBULENCE BECAUSE THE

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.158
THE MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED BY

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.727
AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF MORE

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.028

MANY OF THE KLUTE CONCLUSIONS

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.973
IT IS BOTH THE FLUSHABLE.

BEEN DONE SPECIFIC TO THE

FLUSHABLE WIPES CATEGORY -- THAT

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:33.221
WHEN WE DROP -- A VARIETY OF

FLUSHABLE WIPES INTO THE SYSTEM

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.559
THEY DO COME THROUGH INTACT SOME

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.828
OF THE WIPES ARE HIGH PERFORMERS

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.830
AND THEY COME THROUGH AND

DISPERSE BUT OF A LARGE AMOUNT

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:46.101
DO COME THROUGH AND TAX SO THAT

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:48.336
TELLS US THAT AND THEY ARE NOT

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.372

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.408
STUDY DONE IN A FIELD OUTSIDE OF

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.676
THE LABORATORY SETTING SO WE

THE INDUSTRY WILL ALL TOGETHER

02:01:22.174 --> 02:01:23.075
AND I AND I THINK AS WE'VE SAID

02:01:23.142 --> 02:01:25.044
HERE NOT NOT EVERYBODY IN THAT

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.412
INDUSTRY IS A BAD ACTOR IN FACT

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:27.780
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS WHO

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:29.482
ARE HELPING PEOPLE.

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:32.018
EVERY DAY -- IN IN THIS SPACE

02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:33.786
AND SO I THINK THIS IS JUST IS

02:01:33.853 --> 02:01:37.189
JUST TOO DRASTIC OF A MOVE --

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:38.691
AND I'M ALSO REALLY HESITANT

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:40.326
ANYTIME THAT WE YOU KNOW AND

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:42.328

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:44.530
ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE AN ENTIRE --

INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WITH A PIECE

02:01:46.465 --> 02:01:48.267

YOU TRY TO DO IS.

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:50.803
GO TO SOMETHING THAT DRASTIC

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:52.204
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:53.773
OTHER THINGS THAT COULD HELP.

02:01:53.839 --> 02:01:54.507
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

02:01:54.573 --> 02:01:55.975
PROTECTIONS BECAUSE I THINK

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.343
EVERYBODY IN HERE CARES ABOUT

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.577
ENSURING THAT.

PEOPLE DO GET GOOD ADVICE THAT

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.682

TIME THE BUSINESS RECEIVES ITS

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:09.128
BUSINESS LICENSE.

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.330
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE GENDER TAX

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:12.831
REPEAL ACT PROHIBITS BUSINESSES

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:15.434
FROM CHARGING DIFFERENT PRICES

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:17.369
FOR SERVICES BASED ON GENDER.

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:18.070
VIOLATION OF THE FAULT RESULT IN

THREE TIMES THE ACTUAL DAMAGES

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:25.444
SUFFERED WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.845
THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES CERTAIN

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:29.048
BUSINESSES TO POST A NOTICE AND

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:30.582
TWENTY FOUR POINT FONT OF THE

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:32.618
GENDER TAX REPEAL A VIOLATION OF

IN A THOUSAND DOLLAR STATUTORY

02:06:36.322 --> 02:06:37.523
PENALTY.

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:38.223
THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:39.458
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:41.727
BUSINESSES ARE NOT AWARE THAT

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.095
THIS LAW EVEN EXISTS.

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:44.763
SOME SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:46.932
CHARGE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:47.466
SERVICES BASED ON TIME AND

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:48.701
EFFORT.

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:49.902
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TARGETED

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:51.103
WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.304
DEMANDING THE MINIMUM STATUTORY

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:55.307
PAMPHLET PENALTY AND MORE.

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:56.075
PERSONALLY THIS IS THAT

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.476
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE MANY OF

02:06:57.543 --> 02:06:58.544
YOU KNOW I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS

02:06:58.610 --> 02:06:59.712
I DESIGNED SENSORY FAMILY

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.113
CLOTHING FOR LITTLE GIRLS.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.648
AND THE REASON I CHOSE LITTLE

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:03.983
GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS IS BECAUSE

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.584
IT'S MORE FUN TO DESIGN FOR

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:08.387
LITTLE GIRLS -- BUT HAD I DONE

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:10.990
THIS ALSO FOR BOYS I WOULD HAVE

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:12.524
NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS LAW AND I

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:13.792
THINK I WOULD HAVE VIOLATED IT.

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.260
AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE SMALL

02:07:15.327 --> 02:07:17.329
THINGS WE CAN DO TO REALLY MAKE

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:19.832
SURE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AWARE

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:21.433
AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW.

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.136
SO AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN WOULD

02:07:24.203 --> 02:07:25.604
REQUIRE CITY OR COUNTY.

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.505
WHO ISSUES ISSUES THE BUSINESS

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:27.606
LICENSE TO NOTICE?

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.208
GIVE NOTICE OF THE GENDER TAX

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:31.643
REPEAL ACT OF THE TIME THE

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:32.277
BUSINESS RECEIVES ITS BUSINESS

02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:32.978
LIFE.

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:34.880
IN ADDITION AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:35.481
WHAT AUTHORIZED THE CITY OR

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:37.049
COUNTY TO INCREASE THE FEES FOR

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:38.283
A BUSINESS LICENSE TO RECOVER

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:40.019
THE ACTUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:41.186
THE ISSUING THIS NOTICE.

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:42.955

CHOICE TO HAVE FOOD STORE WHICH

02:12:21.166 --> 02:12:22.801

THOSE MARKET REACH OF THOSE

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:26.138
BUSINESSES.

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:28.073
THERE'S TWO BASIC MODELS JUST TO

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.541
GIVE YOU A LITTLE IDEA OF THESE

02:12:29.608 --> 02:12:31.610
PLATFORMS -- FIRST FOR MANY

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.378
GROCERY FOOD DELIVERY ORDERS A

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:35.213
CUSTOMER SUBMITS IN ORDER TO THE

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.181
GROCERY STORE AND A GROCERY

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:38.016
STORE EMPLOYEE ASSEMBLES THE

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:39.017
ORDER.

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:40.419
AND THEN THE DRIVER WORKING ON

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:41.887
THE DELIVERY PLATFORM PICKS UP

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.255
THE ORDER AND DELIVERS THAT TO

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:45.924
THE CUSTOMER. FOR OTHER ORDERS A

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:47.059
SHOPPER GOES TO THE GROCERY

02:12:47.125 --> 02:12:49.061
STORE PICKS UP THE GROCERIES IN

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.595
THE SAME WAY THE CONSUMER WOULD

02:12:50.662 --> 02:12:52.431
AND THEN THE SHOPPER ACTS LIKE

02:12:52.497 --> 02:12:53.432
THIS CONSUMER.

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:55.100
THAT PAYS FOR THE GROCERIES AND

02:12:55.167 --> 02:12:56.468
TRANSPORTS THEM TO THE CONSUMERS

02:12:56.535 --> 02:12:57.803
HOME.

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.304
SO FOR THE BILL IT BY ONE OF THE

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:00.872
PROVISIONS THE BILL REQUIRES ADD

02:13:00.939 --> 02:13:02.374
THESE DRIVERS HAVE FOOD HANDLER

02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:04.376
CARDS NOT EVEN GROCERY STORE

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:07.446
pSAME THING AS THE SHOPPERS WOULD

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:08.013
DO.

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.014
ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FOOD

02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:11.116
HANDLER CARDS ONLY THOSE

02:13:11.183 --> 02:13:12.751
EMPLOYEES THAT PREPARE AND SERVE

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:14.820
FOOD ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FOOD

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:15.620
HANDLER CARDS.

02:13:15.687 --> 02:13:16.855
DIFFERENT FOOD HANDLER CARD

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:19.024
PROGRAM REQUIRES A NINETY MINUTE

02:13:19.091 --> 02:13:20.992
COURSE AND THEN PASSING A FORTY

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:23.295
QUESTION TEST FOCUS ON HOW FOOD

02:13:23.362 --> 02:13:26.131
IS PREPARED AND SERVED NOTHOW

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:27.699
FOOD IS GONNA PICKED UP FROM THE

02:13:27.766 --> 02:13:29.134
GROCERY STORE AND THEN DELIVERED

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:30.268
TO A CONSUMER.

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:31.436
SO THE INTENT OF THE FOOD

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:33.171
HANDLER CARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR

02:13:33.238 --> 02:13:34.473
WORKERS AT RESTAURANTS AND OTHER

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:35.841
ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE FOOD IS

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.142
BEING PREPARED AND SERVE WHICH

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.543
IS NOT THE CASE FOR THESE

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:39.945
DRIVERS SIMPLY COLLECTING.

02:13:40.011 --> 02:13:41.813

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.148
TO A CONSUMER.

02:13:43.215 --> 02:13:44.416
THEY DID SOME HURDLE OF THIS

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:45.884
WOULD REQUIRE THAT DELIVERY

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:47.185
DRIVERS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THIS

02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:48.520
FOOD HANDLER CARD WHICH WOULD BE

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:50.021
A ROAD BLOCK FOR MANY OF THESE

02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:52.023
DRIVERS WHO JUST DO THIS -- TO

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:53.525
MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA MONEY --

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:55.127
WHILE DOING OTHER JOBS OR

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:57.763
RAISING AT CHILD OR BEING A

02:13:57.829 --> 02:13:59.398

HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FINAL ONE

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.170
I'LL MENTION IS THAT.

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:05.637
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:06.905
CALIFORNIA WOULD SUPPLANT

WAGE LOSS IF WE GET INJURED ON

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:56.707
THE JOB WE ARE ON OUR OWN AS WE

02:26:56.774 --> 02:26:57.842
ARE NOT COVERED BY WORKERS

02:26:57.909 --> 02:26:59.377
COMPENSATION LAWS.

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:05.016

IN FACT WE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:09.554
CHILD CARE SURVEYS THAT WE

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:10.521

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:12.757
JUST LET THAT SINK IN FOR A

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:15.259
MOMENT WE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:18.796

02:27:18.863 --> 02:27:21.566
THIS LOOK AT THINGS LIKE.

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.634
SAVINGS SIX DAYS OF WORK

02:27:23.701 --> 02:27:24.902
VACATION TIME ARE JUST A PIPE

02:27:24.969 --> 02:27:27.438
DREAM I FACE CHALLENGES ON A

SALLY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:41.352
THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME.

02:27:41.419 --> 02:27:43.988
AND I DOUBT IT WILL BE THE LAST

02:27:44.055 --> 02:27:45.523
BECAUSE OF THE LOW WAGES I EARN

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:47.024
WHEN I DON'T GET PAID ON TIME

02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:48.459
THAT MEANS THAT I CAN'T PAY MY

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:53.231
THE TABLE. FOR MY FAMILY AND I

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:54.765

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:40.578
THIS INFORMATION BE SHARED THIS

02:33:40.644 --> 02:33:42.813
PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.815
BUSINESS WE SHARED WITH SOME

02:33:44.882 --> 02:33:46.917
THIRD PARTY GROUP -- THAT MAY

02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:48.285
HAVE AN INTENT THAT YOU JUST

02:33:48.352 --> 02:33:50.187
THAT YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY

02:33:50.254 --> 02:33:52.189
AGREE WITH -- SO I THINK WE

02:33:52.256 --> 02:33:52.923
SHOULD YOU KNOW HELP PROTECT

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:55.326
THAT AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS

02:33:55.392 --> 02:33:56.126
THAT'S WHY.

02:33:56.193 --> 02:33:57.528
I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOUR

02:33:57.595 --> 02:33:58.929
INTENT BEHIND IT AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:33:58.996 --> 02:34:02.533
TRYING TO DO AND AND AND

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:04.702
CERTAINLY.

02:34:04.768 --> 02:34:05.669
YOUNG SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT BUT I

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:06.503
JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:08.372
NOT IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:10.107
WE NEED A LOT OF CHILD CARE

02:34:10.174 --> 02:34:11.408
PROVIDERS OBVIOUSLY IT.

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:12.643
IN THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT

02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.078
WE'RE WORKING ON A MANY

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:17.715
DIFFERENT ASPECTS -- AND SO

02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:18.315
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:19.416
BILL.

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:20.651
CAN I JUST RESPOND I THINK THAT

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:22.219
THAT'S ONE OF THE THE ELEMENTS

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:24.955
THAT THAT COME UP -- IN TERMS OF

02:34:25.022 --> 02:34:26.223
THE COST BUT EIGHT EIGHT THINK

02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:26.957
THAT.

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:29.893
THE REAL COST IS OUR FUTURE AND

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.895
IF WE DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE

02:34:31.962 --> 02:34:32.796
WORKERS.

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:34.398
THAT HAS A HUGE COST TO THE

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:36.166
STATE TO THE EDUCATION AND

02:34:36.233 --> 02:34:38.569
PREPARATION OF OUR KIDS AND I

02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:39.970
THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:41.672
WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.107
ACROSS ALL THE STATE.

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:46.210
ABOUT A CHILD CARE WORKERS WHO

02:34:46.276 --> 02:34:48.078
ARE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:49.747
SUBSIDIES.

02:34:49.813 --> 02:34:52.082
THAT THE FAMILIES THAT THEY

02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:54.918
SERVE QUALIFY FOR US SO WE PAY

02:34:54.985 --> 02:34:56.687
FOR IT LET'S JUST BE VERY CLEAR --

02:34:56.754 --> 02:34:58.255
A AND IT'S THROUGH ITS STATE

02:34:58.322 --> 02:34:59.890
SUBSIDIES SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:34:59.957 --> 02:35:02.660
BIGGER -- ISSUE AND I YOU KNOW I

02:35:02.726 --> 02:35:04.595
I THINK RESPECTFULLY ANYONEWHO

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:05.596
DOESN'T WANT TO BE PART OF

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:07.297
SOMETHING HAS THE ABILITY TO SAY

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.233
NO -- BUT IT'S EIGHT THAT NEVER

02:35:09.299 --> 02:35:12.136
GOES AWAY -- INDEPENDENT OF

02:35:12.202 --> 02:35:13.904
SOMEONE MAKING SURE THAT THEY

02:35:13.971 --> 02:35:17.875
HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION.

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:19.643
THAT COULD HELP THEM.

02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:20.711
JUST A FOLLOW UP REALLY QUICK IS

02:35:20.778 --> 02:35:22.012
WHAT IF IT BECOMES A CLOTHES

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:22.680
SHOP THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A SUCH

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:24.381
THAN THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:25.983
CORRECT I MEAN IT WHEN YOU CAN

02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:26.617
RESPOND TO IT THAT'S FINE BUT I

02:35:26.684 --> 02:35:27.317
MEAN.

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:29.319
ULTIMATELY AS YOU GAIN MORE

02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:31.822
BARGAINING POWER RIGHT. FOR

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:34.024
EXAMPLESTATE WORKERS RIGHT NOW

02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:36.160

INTO THAT SITUATION RIGHT.

02:35:42.232 --> 02:35:44.435
THEN AND ALSO I AGAIN I I I I GO

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:45.869
BACK TO THE ISSUE OF ARE WE

02:35:45.936 --> 02:35:47.805
GONNA GET MORE CHILD CARE

02:35:47.871 --> 02:35:49.206
WORKERS OUT OF UNIONIZATION.

02:35:49.273 --> 02:35:50.441
WE'RE GONNA GET MORE CHILD CARE

02:35:50.507 --> 02:35:52.342
WORKERS WHEN WE PAY THEM WELL

02:35:52.409 --> 02:35:53.477
WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THAT.

02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:55.746
IF THE EVIDENCE WITH ANY OTHER

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:57.648
INDUSTRY WHEN PAY SUPPORTS THE

02:35:57.715 --> 02:35:59.817
WORK OF SOMEONE DOING THAT WORK

02:36:01.719 --> 02:36:04.755
MORE WORKERS WE HAVE.

02:36:04.822 --> 02:36:05.823
CHILD CARE WORKERS.

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:08.459
WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO BE IN THAT

02:36:08.525 --> 02:36:10.728
SPACE WHO WILL GO WORK FOR A

02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:12.162
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.897
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT PAYS MORE

02:36:13.964 --> 02:36:16.300
THAN WHAT THEY GET PAID?

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:18.335
IT'S DRIVING IT'S SIMPLE IT'S

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:19.703
SIMPLE ECONOMICS IT'S DRIVING

02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:22.539
PEOPLE OUT OF AN INDUSTRY

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:24.108
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD.

02:36:24.174 --> 02:36:25.275
AN UP ALL THE SAID I THINK

02:36:25.342 --> 02:36:27.678
THAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE I HAVE

02:36:27.745 --> 02:36:29.379

02:36:29.446 --> 02:36:30.514
HAVE RESEARCH YOU TELL ME WHO

02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:31.315
YOU LIKE IF I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY

02:36:31.381 --> 02:36:33.217
EVIDENCE OF THAT AND I HAVE HAD

02:36:33.283 --> 02:36:33.951
MY OWN.

02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:36.019
MY OWN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES

02:36:36.086 --> 02:36:38.422
WITH CHILD CARE WORKERS HE SAID

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:41.291
THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT YEAH --

02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:42.860
AND SO WE IS HIS WE CAN ALL TALK

02:36:42.926 --> 02:36:44.628
ABOUT OUR OWN SUBJECTIVE STORIES

02:36:44.695 --> 02:36:46.396
BUT YOU KNOW ABSENT SOME REAL

02:36:46.463 --> 02:36:47.765
EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S THE CASE

02:36:47.831 --> 02:36:49.099
I'M CONCERNED WITH SOMETHING

02:36:49.166 --> 02:36:50.267
THAT COULD ACTUALLY.

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:56.507
LEAD TO LESS JOKER WORKERS.

02:36:56.573 --> 02:36:57.641
MISTER KALRA THE MS GONZALEZ.

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:58.942
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I

02:36:59.009 --> 02:37:00.144

PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL

02:37:00.878 --> 02:37:02.412
I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

02:37:02.479 --> 02:37:05.115
AND I THINK THAT IF YOU TALK TO

02:37:05.182 --> 02:37:06.083
ANY WORKER.

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:08.485

BENEFITS AND A VOICE.

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:12.556
I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE

02:37:12.623 --> 02:37:13.590
WOULD SAY YES TO THAT.

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:15.292
AND THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE

02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:17.928
ARE WORKING IN CHILD CARE -- OUR

02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:20.531
OFTENTIMES WORKING IN ISOLATION

02:37:20.597 --> 02:37:22.432
OFTENTIMES THEIR VICTIMS A WAGE

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:23.567
THEFT OFTENTIMES OF VICTIMS OF

02:37:23.634 --> 02:37:25.502
HARASSMENT AND THEY CERTAINLY

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:26.103
DON'T HAVE THE BOYS THAT THEY

02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:26.770
DESERVE.

02:37:26.837 --> 02:37:28.338
CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANT JOB

02:37:28.405 --> 02:37:29.940
THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US

02:37:30.007 --> 02:37:31.842
AND SIMPLY JUST SAYING WELL.

02:37:31.909 --> 02:37:34.077
IF WE CAN IF IF FAMILIES PAVE

02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:34.678
THEIR CHILD CARE WORKERS THAT

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:35.846
HAS MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:37.548
IS REALLY AB I DISRESPECTED

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:39.116
THOSE THEY'RE DOING THE WORK --

02:37:39.183 --> 02:37:40.751
BECAUSE REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING

02:37:40.818 --> 02:37:43.020
THE THE THOSE THAT.

02:37:43.086 --> 02:37:44.555
ARE IN THE THE THE HAD THE LEAST

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:45.823
AMOUNT OF POWER.

02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:47.691
UP TO STAND UP TO ASK FOR A

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:49.193
BETTER WAGES AND TREATMENT AND

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:51.195
BENEFITS TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:53.230
THE BURDEN OF HAVING LOWER

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:54.398
CHILDCARE COSTS.

02:37:54.464 --> 02:37:56.166
AS AS THE AUTHOR CORRECTLY SAID

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:58.402
THE MONEY COMES FROM SOMEWHERE

02:37:58.468 --> 02:37:59.503
IT'S NOT LIKE -- BALLS WITH A

02:37:59.570 --> 02:38:00.704
FAMILY GOING TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.806
ON CHILD CARE AND THEN THAT THAT

02:38:02.873 --> 02:38:04.608
MONEY JUST RECKLESS APPEARS SOME

02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:05.142
SOMEWHERE.

02:38:05.209 --> 02:38:06.076
NO WE'RE EITHER PAYING IT

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:07.511
BECAUSE ARE SUBSIDIZING OTHER.

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.746
BENEFITS THAT THESE WORKERS ARE

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.347
NOT.

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:13.116
A DON'T HAVE THAT DON'T HAVE OR

02:38:13.183 --> 02:38:14.651
THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING --

02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:16.086
IN POVERTY.

02:38:16.153 --> 02:38:18.622
AND SO IT'S AN EITHER OR AND I

02:38:18.689 --> 02:38:19.957
THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL ALWAYS WE

02:38:20.023 --> 02:38:21.291
ALWAYS A BALANCING TEST ON ALL

02:38:21.358 --> 02:38:22.259
THESE ISSUES.

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:22.759
BUT I THINK THERE'S AN

02:38:22.826 --> 02:38:23.994
OVERRIDING PUBLIC POLICY

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:25.996
INTERESTS FOR US TO ENSURE THAT

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:27.364
NOT JUST THE CURRENT WORK FORCE

02:38:27.431 --> 02:38:28.699
WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE A

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:29.967
GROWING WORK FORCE A CHILD CARE

02:38:30.033 --> 02:38:31.034
WORKERS WHO ARE.

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:33.136
IN MOST CASES THE VERY FIRST

02:38:33.203 --> 02:38:35.105
EDUCATOR THAT A CHILD HAS -- WE

02:38:35.172 --> 02:38:36.840
NEED TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH AND

02:38:36.907 --> 02:38:37.407
TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT AND

02:38:37.474 --> 02:38:38.242
DIGNITY.

02:38:38.308 --> 02:38:39.843
AND I THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:43.247
THIS INDUSTRY IS -- ONE THAT IS --

02:38:43.313 --> 02:38:44.481
WILLIAM BECAUSE SEE PARALLELS TO

02:38:44.548 --> 02:38:45.649
MANY OTHER INDUSTRY THERE ARE

02:38:45.716 --> 02:38:46.683
DOMINATED BY A WOMAN A FEMALE

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:49.920
WORK FORCE FOR THE MOST PART --

02:38:49.987 --> 02:38:51.655
THAT GET PAID LESS THAN HALF

02:38:51.722 --> 02:39:01.565
LESS BENEFITS AGAIN BLOOD THAT'S

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:02.099
RESPECT I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:39:02.165 --> 02:39:04.635
CHANGE THAT AND THAT'S WHY I

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:06.603
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL.

THEM THE BIGGEST THING IS

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:15.732
HAPPENING MY DISTRICT IS IS A

02:51:15.798 --> 02:51:18.301
WILDFIRE AND ESPECIALLY IN THESE.

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:19.702

DISASTROUS SITUATIONS.

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:24.007
THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT THERE

IS LIKE RENTS BIKING AND THERE'S

02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:28.144

OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAPPEN AND

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:33.249
THAT RENTS ARE BEING YOU KNOW --

02:51:33.316 --> 02:51:34.851
BASICALLY ARBITRARILY AND

02:51:34.917 --> 02:51:36.719
INFLATED -- FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

HOUSING -- AND SO IN THAT

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:43.026
CONTEXT IN AND I THINK

02:51:45.928 --> 02:51:48.731
CRISIS ARE OUR ULTIMATE.

02:51:48.798 --> 02:51:50.266
SOLUTION IS INCREASING SUPPLY

02:51:50.333 --> 02:51:52.035
LIKE WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE

02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:54.237
HOUSING -- IN THE FACT THAT WE

02:51:54.303 --> 02:51:55.738
HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT WHETHER

02:51:55.805 --> 02:51:57.240
BECAUSE OF BURDENSOME

02:51:57.306 --> 02:51:59.809
REGULATIONS OR BECAUSE THE NAME

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:03.279
RESTRICTIONS -- FOR WHATEVER

02:52:03.346 --> 02:52:04.714
REASON WE HAVEN'T BUILT A LOT OF

02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:06.182
HOUSING AND THAT ONLY MAKES THE

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:07.850
PROBLEM WORSE BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:10.753

WANT TO SEE DATA RIGHT -- BUT WE

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:37.714
CAN OFF OFTEN INTERPRET THAT

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:40.416
DATA DIFFERENTLY -- AND I THINK

02:52:40.483 --> 02:52:42.351
IN THE IN THE GENERAL'S SCOPE OF

02:52:42.418 --> 02:52:43.553

02:52:43.619 --> 02:52:44.620
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE

02:52:44.687 --> 02:52:45.922
BUSINESS OF TELLING PEOPLE WHAT

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:48.758
THEY SHOULD RENT THEIR HOMES.

02:52:48.825 --> 02:52:50.460
FOR THE I DON'T BELIEVE IN RENT

02:52:50.526 --> 02:52:52.895
CONTROL -- I DO BELIEVE IN

02:52:52.962 --> 02:52:55.331

MAYBE YOU CAN JUST KIND OF

02:53:10.947 --> 02:53:11.914
ADDRESS THAT.

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:15.485
THAT WAS A LOT OF TICKET BUT NO

02:53:15.551 --> 02:53:16.352
HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE IN A FEW

02:53:16.419 --> 02:53:19.255

THE SPIKES AND RENT YOU KNOW

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:27.964
THIS BILL DOESN'T SEEK -- TO PUT

02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:29.365
ANY KIND OF RENTER PROTECTIONS

02:53:29.432 --> 02:53:30.533
ON THOSE THERE'S OTHER BILLS I

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.934

IT'S IT'S AT A PUNISHMENT

03:14:39.167 --> 03:14:41.403

TO FOLLOW UP AND AND GET SOME OF

03:40:03.490 --> 03:40:05.191
THE REPORTS THAT -- MIGHT LEAD

03:40:05.258 --> 03:40:05.725
TO THIS BEING ONE OF THE

03:40:05.792 --> 03:40:07.427
SUGGESTIONS TO REDUCE PLASTIC

03:40:07.494 --> 03:40:09.095
WASTE THAT MAY HAVE MORE DATA OR

BY NO CONTAMINATION IS A BIG

03:40:14.301 --> 03:40:15.869
PART OF IT AS WELL AS THE SIZE

03:40:15.936 --> 03:40:22.008
THAT LEADS TO A LOWER LIKELIHOOD

03:40:22.075 --> 03:40:23.677
OF IT BEING RECYCLED.

03:40:23.743 --> 03:40:25.278

SO IF THEY'RE ALREADY KIND OF

03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:08.154
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

03:41:08.221 --> 03:41:10.490
YEAH I MEAN DO WE AGAIN WE NEED.

03:41:10.557 --> 03:41:12.225
AN ALL OUT BAN WELL I THINK THAT

03:41:12.292 --> 03:41:13.093
THAT YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:14.427
BEFORE BY THE WAY IF THE IF

03:41:14.494 --> 03:41:16.329
INDUSTRY WASN'T AND WE ARE

03:41:16.396 --> 03:41:17.530
PUTTING THIS IN PLACE THE

03:41:17.597 --> 03:41:18.531
ARGUMENT WOULD BE WHILE YOU'RE

03:41:18.598 --> 03:41:19.966
ENFORCING SOMETHING THAT.

03:41:20.033 --> 03:41:21.835
WE DON'T WANT TO DO I THINK THAT

03:41:21.901 --> 03:41:24.304
IT'S A IT SHOULD BE.

03:41:24.371 --> 03:41:25.405
GOT MORE GREATLY APPRECIATED

03:41:25.472 --> 03:41:27.240
THAT A BILL COMES FOR THAT'S

03:41:27.307 --> 03:41:28.541
ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING THE CONTACT

03:41:28.608 --> 03:41:29.743
THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING IN THE

03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:31.378
TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING.

03:41:31.444 --> 03:41:33.313
BY MAKING IT A STATEWIDE POLICY

03:41:33.380 --> 03:41:34.514
RATHER THAN HAVING JURISDICTIONS

03:41:34.581 --> 03:41:36.916
DO IT ONE BY ONE WHICH WHICH IS

03:41:36.983 --> 03:41:37.817
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

03:41:37.884 --> 03:41:38.652
DISCUSSED THEY DISCUSSED MISSED

03:41:38.718 --> 03:41:40.587
CALL OTHER DAY.

03:41:40.654 --> 03:41:44.691
YESTERDAY -- OR RATHER THAN --

03:41:44.758 --> 03:41:46.459
OF HAVING A DIFFERENT SET OF

03:41:46.526 --> 03:41:48.762
PROTOCOLS WHAT YOU DO IS YOU

03:41:48.828 --> 03:41:49.963
SIMPLY IS OKAY YOU'RE MOVING

03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.764
INSTRUCTION ANYWAY.

03:41:50.830 --> 03:41:52.232
LET'S MOVE FORWARD IT ALLOWS

03:41:52.298 --> 03:41:54.567
INDUSTRY -- ORGANIZATIONS TO

03:41:54.634 --> 03:41:56.236
HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSITION --

03:41:56.302 --> 03:41:58.805
ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER HOTELS I

03:41:58.872 --> 03:41:59.773
HAD ALLOWS LARGER SHOULD HOTELS

03:41:59.839 --> 03:42:02.075
TO SET AN EXPECTATION AS TO HOW

03:42:02.142 --> 03:42:03.076
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THEIR SUPPLY

03:42:03.143 --> 03:42:04.511
CHAIN SET UP -- BUT THE BOTTOM

03:42:04.577 --> 03:42:07.247
LINE IS THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE.

03:42:07.313 --> 03:42:08.948
TO A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CLASSES

03:42:09.015 --> 03:42:10.550
COMING IN OF PEOPLE BEING

03:42:10.617 --> 03:42:12.285
PRODUCED AN ENTRY ALWAYS STREAM

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:14.587
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY

03:42:14.654 --> 03:42:16.389
THINGS WE NEED TO DO -- IT'S

03:42:16.456 --> 03:42:19.159
ALIGNED WITH OTHER EFFORTS TO A

03:42:19.225 --> 03:42:20.160
TO MOVE AWAY FROM SEEN THESE

03:42:20.226 --> 03:42:21.594
PLASTIC IN OUR STATE THAT I KNOW

03:42:21.661 --> 03:42:22.462
THAT WHEN BURKE MANY MEMBERS

03:42:22.529 --> 03:42:23.329
BECAUSE ALSO OTHERS.

03:42:23.396 --> 03:42:25.765
ARE WORKING ON AND BUT YOU CAN

03:42:25.832 --> 03:42:26.833
HAVE THAT GOAL BUT YOU HAVE TO

03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:29.035
HAVE ACTUALLY MORE SPECIFIC

03:42:29.102 --> 03:42:30.136
INITIATIVES TO ACTUALLY MOVE

03:42:30.203 --> 03:42:31.304
TOWARDS THAT GOAL.

03:42:31.371 --> 03:42:33.073
AND SO THIS IS AGAIN IT'S A

03:42:33.139 --> 03:42:34.607
PUBLIC POLICY.

03:42:34.674 --> 03:42:35.909
DEBATE AS TO WHETHER IT'S

03:42:35.975 --> 03:42:45.652
VALUABLE FOR US TO GET RID OF

03:42:45.719 --> 03:42:47.253
THESE SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES.

03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:48.888
TOILETRIES AND I JUST THINK THE

03:42:48.955 --> 03:42:49.856
FACT INDUSTRIES ALREADY MOVING

03:42:49.923 --> 03:42:52.559
THAT DIRECTION HOST OF ASSAULTED

03:42:52.625 --> 03:42:53.193
AND MAKES IT MORE VIBRANT WHY WE

03:42:53.259 --> 03:42:55.228
SHOULD DO IT.

03:42:55.295 --> 03:42:56.963
WITHOUT -- I WENT THANK YOU FOR

03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:58.264

03:43:19.085 --> 03:43:19.753
THAT WE PRODUCE DON'T GET

03:43:19.819 --> 03:43:21.121

WHETHER IT'S COUNTY PUBLIC CALL

03:45:00.820 --> 03:45:01.654
FOR OF LOCAL CULTURES IS -- THE

03:45:01.721 --> 03:45:02.322
REALITY IS PRAGMATICALLY THEY'RE

TO SEE AND IDENTIFY THE FACT

03:45:07.193 --> 03:45:08.761

COMPLYING AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND

03:45:10.930 --> 03:45:12.632

03:45:19.272 --> 03:45:21.140
THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED THAT IT

COULD BE RECTIFIED IN A WAY THAT.

03:45:22.575 --> 03:45:24.277
THAT'S AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE

03:45:24.344 --> 03:45:26.412

FOUR YEARS FOR SMALLER

03:45:36.723 --> 03:45:37.957

COULD BE SOMETHING THAT -- WE

03:45:49.736 --> 03:45:51.070
COULD WORK ON IN TERMS TO MAKE

03:45:51.137 --> 03:45:52.071
IT EASIER FOR LOCAL

03:45:52.138 --> 03:45:52.839
JURISDICTIONS NOT HAVE TO GO

03:45:52.906 --> 03:45:54.774
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF NOT

03:45:54.841 --> 03:45:55.842
HAVING LOCAL ORDINANCES IF WE

03:45:55.909 --> 03:45:56.943
COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WE

03:45:57.010 --> 03:45:58.077
BELIEVE MAKE SENSE.

03:45:58.144 --> 03:45:59.512
THAT -- THERE COULD BE AN

03:45:59.579 --> 03:46:00.480

CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- THAT

04:06:32.911 --> 04:06:34.579
THE AUTHOR ON THIS BECAUSE I

04:06:34.646 --> 04:06:36.615
THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

04:06:36.681 --> 04:06:38.517
FEATURE -- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND I'M

04:06:44.689 --> 04:06:45.724
STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT.

04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:46.892
NOTHING WE CAN DO IS REALLY

04:06:46.958 --> 04:06:47.926
GONNA KEEP THE DATA OF OUR

04:06:47.993 --> 04:06:49.528
COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE HANDS.

04:06:49.594 --> 04:06:51.329
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION SO JUST

04:06:51.396 --> 04:06:53.565
THAT'S KIND OF A I DON'T THINK

04:06:53.632 --> 04:06:57.135
SHE WHERE ANYTHING.

04:06:57.202 --> 04:06:58.403

BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

04:07:06.378 --> 04:07:07.612
I DO SORT OF SHUDDER WHEN WE

04:07:07.679 --> 04:07:08.680
TALK ABOUT THIS NOTION OF

04:07:08.747 --> 04:07:11.016
SANCTUARY STATE BECAUSE SB FIFTY

04:07:11.082 --> 04:07:12.150
FOUR DID NOT IN FACT CREATE A

04:07:12.217 --> 04:07:13.785
SANCTUARY STATE IT'S THAT'S

04:07:13.852 --> 04:07:15.387
THAT'S JUST POLITICAL RHETORIC.

04:07:15.453 --> 04:07:16.855
I WISH WE COULD I WISH THERE WAS

04:07:16.922 --> 04:07:19.558
MORE THAT THAT WE COULD DO TO

04:07:19.624 --> 04:07:20.258
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS.

04:07:20.325 --> 04:07:23.195
ACTUALLY IN IN.

04:07:23.261 --> 04:07:25.063
THIS NEAR TIME FRAME WHEN WE'RE

04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:27.966
STRUGGLING WITH VERY AGGRESSIVE

04:07:28.033 --> 04:07:30.035
IN ABUSIVE FEDERAL POLICY.

04:07:30.101 --> 04:07:31.636
THE THE ONE POINT THAT THE

04:07:31.703 --> 04:07:32.671
OPPOSITION BRINGS THAT I THINK

04:07:32.737 --> 04:07:34.706
WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF AND

04:07:34.773 --> 04:07:36.007
I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS IT

04:07:36.074 --> 04:07:37.742
AS IT MOVES FORWARD.

04:07:37.809 --> 04:07:39.477
BUT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE

04:07:39.544 --> 04:07:40.812
STRUCTURES AND LAWS IN THE STATE

04:07:40.879 --> 04:07:43.281
OF CALIFORNIA THAT ONCE WE GET A

04:07:43.348 --> 04:07:45.050
MORE RATIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT.

04:07:48.920 --> 04:07:50.655
HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE AND I THINK

04:07:50.722 --> 04:07:51.790
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

04:07:51.856 --> 04:07:53.792
BE VERY COGNIZANT UP AS AS WE

04:07:53.858 --> 04:07:55.193
MOVE FORWARD SO WE CAN BE

04:07:55.260 --> 04:07:57.562
PROTECTIVE BUT UNWINDING THINGS

04:07:57.629 --> 04:07:59.698
THAT ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY?

04:07:59.764 --> 04:08:01.099
PERHAPS OVERLY RESTRICTIVE SEEMS

04:08:01.166 --> 04:08:04.135
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA

04:08:04.202 --> 04:08:07.038
HAVE TO TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY.

04:08:07.105 --> 04:08:08.139
