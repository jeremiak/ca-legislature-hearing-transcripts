THE COMMITTEE THE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL AND BY ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. AND WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS I THINK IT OPEN THE DOOR TO CONTINUE ON. AS AMENDED THIS BILL ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO EVALUATE WHAT STEPS CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE. TO HELP IMPROVE THE LICENSURE OF ADVANCED PRACTICE RADIOLOGICAL TECHNICIANS. AND I CARRY THIS BILL BECAUSE MANY OF OUR VETERANS AND TRANSITIONING BACK INTO THE CIVILIAN WORLD. HAVE TRAINED PARTICIPATED IN THEIR WORLD OF THAT WHICH CALLED THEIR M. O. S. THEIR MILITARY OCT. OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES WHICH EXCEEDS. IN SOME CASES TRADITIONAL TECHNICIANS TRAINING. THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES- AND THAT IT IS SEVENTH BY THIS BILL WILL EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING DONE IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS SPACE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP MEET THE EVER INCREASING DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ADVANCE CARE TECHNICIANS IN RADIOLOGY ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THIRTY STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BY IMPLEMENTING FURTHER STUDY INTO HOW CALIFORNIA CAN BEST RECOGNIZES PRACTICE NOT ONLY DO WE CREATE FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT WE CAN ALSO CREATE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS WELCOME TO OUR VETERANS AND IN TODAY'S WORLD WITH THEIR TRAINING AND EXPERTISE WE NEED ALL THE VETERANS TO PARTICIPATE. MANY VETERANS HAVE BEEN ADVANCED RADIOLOGICAL TRAINING THAT CAN HELP TOWARDS WORKING IN THIS SPACE AS A TRANSITION BACK INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. I HOPE THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE FINDS ADDITIONAL ACTIONABLE DATA THAT CALIFORNIA CAN USE TO HELP VETERANS AND SEMINARY TRAINED CIVILIANS GOOD WERE NOT ELIMINATING CIVILIANS TO HAVE THEM ALSO OBTAIN LICENSURE IN THIS EXPANDING MEDICAL PRACTICE CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY BENEFIT WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVE AND WORK AND OUR STATE.

MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE WITH THEIR AND READ NECESSITY IT'S GOOD MORNING- REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN REGISTRY RADIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIST OF THE RADIOLOGICAL SYSTEM WAS CREATED BY THE MILITARY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THERE IS A DEARTH OF RADIOLOGISTS. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO MORE THAN THE- BRADY WAS ALLOWED BEFORE THEY CAN DO X. RAY UNITS FOREST COPIC SYSTEMS MAMMOGRAPHY MRI. THE RECOGNIZED IN THIRTY SIX STATES FOR THEIR ABILITY TO DO IT IN THIS WHILE WE WANTED TO DO SUNSET WE DID LISTEN TO YOUR COMMITTEE WE DEFERRED TO YOUR STAFF. AND BELIEVE THAT THIS- THIS THIS WAY OF DOING THE RESEARCH MAKES BETTER SENSE IN THE OLD DAYS WE USED TO DO THE- OFSTED REPORTS AND THEY WOULD END UP BEING FOUGHT OVER-ANYWAY. THIS THIS BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER EVEN WITH THE SPIRIT VIEWS AND IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE AND IT WORKS THANK YOU. THIS IS YOUR NUMBERS BY BACK THEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY SO PHYSICIANS AT RETAIL TO POSITIONS ARE COLLABORATING WITH. THE R. TEASE IN THIS EXPANDED ROLE IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THIS IS BUSINESS MR CALE OF THE AUTHOR INDICATED. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF DECADES A NUMBER OF STATES. THE VOLUME OF IMAGING CONTINUES TO INCREASE THE NEEDS OF RADIOLOGISTS IN TERMS OF THE PROCEDURES THEY DO. AN MRI THESE DAYS CAN GENERATE HUNDREDS OF IMAGES THAT IN A POSITION HAS TO REVIEW SO. THAT ARE A COULD BE USEFUL IN ASSUMING SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE RADIOLOGIST A FOCUS ON IMAGING. AND THE STUDIES AND INTERPRETATIONS AND WITH TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THESE INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT VERY VALUABLE- IN IMAGING PRACTICE- IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME THERE'S NO ABILITY FOR THESE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO. REALLY BE USED IN CALIFORNIATO THEIR FULL TRAINING AND COMPETENCY. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PATH FORWARD THIS BILL SETS UP THAT MECHANISM APPRECIATE. THE CHAIR AND STAFF IN THE AUTHOR LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES HERE- AND LOOK FORWARD TO FINDING A PATH FORWARD.

AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OCCURS LANE JUNIOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA A CNA OPPOSES SB FOUR EIGHTY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RADIOLOGY ASSISTING COMMITTEE TO RESEARCH AND RECOMMEND POTENTIAL STATUTORY CHANGES TO GRANT EXPANDING PRACTICE OF THE ALREADY THE CERTIFIED RADIOLOGY TECHNICIANS OR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AS PROPOSED IN SB FOUR EIGHTY. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PASSED THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT AND ADMINISTER REGULATIONS THAT ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT MAY BE PERFORMED. BY A LICENSED MEDICAL ASSISTANT THESE REGULATORY CHANGES DO NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY. SB FOUR EIGHTY POSITS THE TWELVE MEMBER RADIOLOGY ASSISTING COMMITTEE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SPECIALTY MEDICAL SYSTEM LICENSOR OF NICK OCCUPATION THAT IS CURRENTLY UNLICENSED- IN CNA CONTENDS THAT UNLICENSED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WHO DESIRE TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS IN RADIOLOGY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED. AND GAINING EDUCATIONAL TRAINING TOWARDS CERTIFICATION BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS A RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN. WE ALSO QUESTION THE NASA NECESSITY OF CREATING A NEW LICENSE OR CATEGORY FOR RADIOLOGY ASSISTANCE AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW TYPE OF PRACTITIONER WILL LEAD TO A MORE FRAGMENTED SYSTEM OF CARE FOR RADIOLOGY PATIENTS. WE ADVOCATE FOR THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF CARE FOR PATIENTS AND HAVE STRONG CONCERNS WITH ANY MEASURE THAT AIMS TO ESTABLISH NEW LICENSOR. CATEGORIES FOR HEALING ARTS PER PRACTITIONERS FOR THESE REASONS CNA AS OPPOSED TO ASK BEFORE EIGHTY AS AMENDED AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LANG ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JUST ONE MOMENT THIS GET THE MICROPHONE WORKING. THE RAIN SPENCER WITH AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN STRYCHNINE WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL THEY HAVE A- THE ECARD HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS EXISTING VERSION AFTER CHRIS REVIEW THEY DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE MAKE UP OF THE WORKING GROUP- THERE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT RADIOLOGISTS ARE GOING FOR THIS GROUP THAT ARE INCLUDED. I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE AS WELL AS OTHER PHYSICIAN GROUPS AT LEAST BE CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION SO WITH A FOUR TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS CURRENT VERSION I'M SORRY NOW WE DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL THIS ONE BE WITH THE FORD WORKING WITH PRESS TO BE ALL THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LET ME JUST MAKE A NOTE FROM BAD PRACTICE. BEST PRACTICES IN OUR COMMITTEE- SAID IF YOU HAVE A POSITION ON A BILL TO COOLEY IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION TO PUT A RECORD- PUT OUT A LETTER ON RECORD- SO WE I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THE AUTHORS DO AS WELL AND- NEVER- EASY TO COME INTO A HEARING AND LEARN ABOUT OPPOSITION FOR THE FIRST TIME. I DO NOT THAT THIS BILL WAS AMENDED. FAIRLY RECENTLY AND SO. THAT'S A CONSIDERATION THAT I KNOW IS CHALLENGING FOR MANY. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE BILL. I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THAT CENTER ARCH LETTER WE LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR- LOOKING INTO THE AMENDMENTS AS MUCH AS HE HAS AND THE STAFF WITH THE AMENDMENTS I THINK WE CAN GO FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON IT I THINK THE- THE INTERIM STEP IN WHICH YOU SUGGEST IN THIS THAT LEGISLATION FOR THIS TASK FORCE SEEMS LIKE A- A CAREFUL CAUTIOUS ONE I KNOW THAT YOUR- OPPONENTS WOULD LIKE TO GO MUCH FURTHER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE AFTER. A PRUDENT STEP TO ME ON THAT RECOGNIZE THE MOTION FOR SENATOR PAN TO MOVE THE BILL. AS AMENDED. THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG MAI. CHIANG AYE ARCHULETA. AYE PARTULA AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE HILL. HILL AYE LEYVA. LIVE AYE PAN PAN I WILL. LOOK AT. RIGHT AT THAT BILL IS IN NINE ZERO CONGRADULATIONS THAT BILLS OUT CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN WAITING FOR YOUR BILL TO BE HEARD I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME FORWARD. THIS IS THE ITEM NUMBER THREE. SB SIX NINETY TWO BY CENTER SKINNER. PLEASE COME ON UP. WITH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT SB SIX NINETY TWO VERY COMPARABLE BILL PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE LAST YEAR- HOWEVER THE SPONSORS AND I DECIDED TO HOLD THAT COMPARABLE BILL LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OFFICE THAT. DEVELOPS REGULATIONS FOR CANNABIS WAS RELATIVELY NEW WE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF PROCESS HE'S AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ALIGNING WHATEVER- WORK WE WERE DOING ON TRYING TO MAKE TRADE SAMPLES AVAILABLE ALIGNED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN THE- THE CANNABIS ROLES IN REX SO WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE TOO BUSY LAST YEAR TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE- WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE SO THAT'S WHY WE HELD IT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REINTRODUCED AND BEFORE YOU TODAY. SO BASICALLY WHAT THE BILL ADDRESSES IS THE FACT THAT WHILE IN IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER CATEGORY OF A RETAIL A MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION WHATEVER THERE ARE TRADE SAMPLES NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TRADE SAMPLES FOR THE PUBLIC WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LIKE GOING TO COSTCO AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A SAMPLE OF SOME CANNABIS PRODUCT NO IT'S PURELY IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHETHER IT'S IN A PRESCRIPTION TRADE WHATEVER TRADE WHEN A DISTRIBUTOR OR MANUFACTURER GOES TO THE RETAILER. THEY ARE ABLE TO ALLOW THEIR PRODUCT TO BE SAMPLED TO SEE IF THAT RETAILER FOR THAT PRODUCT MEETS THE FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEIR CUSTOMERS NEEDS ARE SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW FOR THAT WITHIN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AGAIN VERY LIMITED IT WOULD BE A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES THAT WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO GET EXCHANGED AND AGAIN THROUGH I NEVER THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMERS ONLY TO. BE LICENSED RETAILER. AS IN THE LICENSE DISTRIBUTORS SO THAT'S ITS PURPOSE AND I'M ALLOW BY. A INDUSTRY PRESENTERS OF GOT MICHAEL WHEELER FROM FLOW KANA IN AMY JENKINS FROM THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WITNESSES VERY GOOD CENTER AND USED- YO ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT THE ANALYSIS YES I AM IN THANK YOU APOLOGIES FOR NOT FIGHTING WITH THAT NO PROBLEM AT ALL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- REMARKS AND WE WELCOME YOUR WITNESSES. TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL WHEELER I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY INITIATIVES THAT FLOW KANA FOR CON IS A REGULATED CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANY- AS MENTION THIS CONCEPT WAS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR UNDER THE BILL NUMBER SB FOUR SEVENTY FIVE. THE SOLUTIONS THIS BILL PROVIDES TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY REGARDING BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRADE SAMPLES. ARE ONLY GREATER THIS YEAR I AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK AGAIN FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS STRONG ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY THIS TRULY IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES AND WE APPLIED THE SENATOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND- HER EFFORTS TO ADVANCE THIS. ISSUE THIS YEAR JUST TWO QUICK POINTS ALL MAKE THIS REALLY WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER EXPOSURE FOR SMALL AND EMERGING CANNABIS BUSINESSES THEY REALLY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THIS WILL PROVIDE THAT AVENUE AND IT WILL REALLY IMPROVE CONSUMER OUTCOMES- OUR RETAILERS NEED TO KNOW- WHAT THESE PRODUCTS DO WHAT THEY'RE AFFECTS ARE SO THEY CAN BETTER INFORM AND EDUCATE MEDICINAL PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES WHO LIKE TO DO A ME TOO WITH THE MICROPHONE COME ON UP. ALICIA PRIEGO HERE ON BEHALF OF EASE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF WHAT PER LOGISTICS AND CMG KHALIFA IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT. HELLO SOLELY SOME HAVE REUNITED KIND OF HAS BEEN ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MORTGAGE JASON BROWN HALF THE COUPLE COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE WERE SUPPORTIVE AMENDED TO THE BILL WE'D LIKE TO SEE AMENDMENTS IN THE- NEXT ITERATION OF THE BUILD UP FOR THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES BY TO DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS ALSO TO MANUFACTURERS AND CULTIVATORS TO BE ABLE TO. SAMPLE THEIR PRODUCTS WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN SO LONG AS THEY'RE TESTED WE'VE OFFERED THOSE MINUTES OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN RISK ISN'T IN TRACI STEELE ON BEHALF OF NATURE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TING A FEW ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE CALIFORNIA COALITION IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX I TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD WILL I BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHORS A SENATOR PAN. S. ONE QUICK QUESTION THE- SAMPLES ARE JUST BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS NOT TO THE PUBLIC BUT IS AND I UNDERSTAND FROM ANALYSIS IT'S FOR ACTUALLY EDUCATION- SO A LET'S SAY A DISTRIBUTOR ONCE A CHAU RETAILER WHAT THERE BE IS IT IS SELLING IT IT IS THE IS THE SAMPLE AND TENDED BE CONSUMED IN ANYWAY I MEAN I GET THE IDEA OF LIKE HERE'S A SAMPLE SO YOU KNOW WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN HOUSE PACKAGE AND SO FORTH- OTHER. IS IT IS RIGHT. THAT THAT THE SAMPLE IS. TO BE USED IT IS TO BE CONSUMED IN ANYWHERE WELL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY. IN THE WAY THE BILLS SIGN UP TO THE RETAILER. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IN SOME CASES SOME RETAILERS MAY WANT TO BECAUSE IF FOR EXAMPLE- AS WE KNOW. IT TEARS- PRODUCTS CAN HAVE A RANGE OF CBT IN THC. LEVELS. AND RATIOS THESE CAN HAVE. THIS THE WHOLE NOTION OF EVEN UNDER RECREATIONAL USE HOW PSYCHO ACTIVE THE- THE PARTICULAR- PRODUCT IS- CAN BE BASED ON THOSE RATIOS OR ON THE- THE- ORIGIN OF THE PARTICULAR CANNABIS- VARIETY. AND. YOU MEAN AGAIN I'M NOT SURE IF ALL OF M COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE. GONE TO A DISPENSARY WORRY CANNABIS RETAIL AND WHEN OFTENTIMES YOU MAY BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS A RECREATIONAL BUT VERY LOW PSYCHOACTIVE AND YOU COULD BE TALKING YOUR YOUR BASED LEAD YOU'RE TALKING TO THAT PERSON AT THE COUNTER TRYING TO GET INFORMATION YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST GO BUY A TEN PRODUCTS AND GO HOME AND BE YOURSELF THE GUINEA PIG. AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT THAT A PERSON BEHIND THE COUNTER HAS THE INFORMATION WAS SOMETIMES THAT DOES REQUIRE THE RETAILER TO HAVE TRIED IT SO THERE'S NOT A RESTRICTION ON THAT IN THE BILL BUT THESE YOU NOTICE IT IS RESTRICTED ON THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE. PASSED IN THAT WAY. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I THINK WE'VE BEEN HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION AND- WE ARE OBVIOUSLY TALKING TO THE. THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE CULTIVATORS AROUND WHETHER BECAUSE IN MOST TRADE SAMPLES IT IS A BROADER THAN JUST THE DISTRIBUTOR AND RETAILER SO WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT WE HAVE NOTHING TO WE HAVE NO AT WE'RE NOT BRING FORTY MINUTE TODAY. AND WITH THAT I WOULD READ EXT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS VERY GOOD CENTER SKINNER IS BROUGHT A BILL TO US WELL AND ACCEPTED THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN THE. A STAFF REPORT IS THERE A MOTION SENATOR HILL IS MOVE THE BILL SO WITH THAT. INVITE THE ODDS SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG CHING AYE ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA AYE DODD AYE DODD AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE HILL.

JEFF OKAY- YES WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL I'M SO SORRY. I MUST OF. BY THAT WE WANT TO INVITE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE- SB TO ALIGN CENTER WIENER WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE YEAH YEAH. IF. OKAY CENTER WE ARE ALL SET YES OKAY VERY GOOD WELCOME. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ON COLLEAGUES FOR HER IN THIS BILL TODAY- THIS BILL WAS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE BACK AND- THIS DOES FOR THE COMMITTEE BACK IN APRIL AND- THE CHAIR ASKED FOR TO BE TO YOUR BILL AND SO. THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE WENT AND WE'RE BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. SENATE BILL TO A ONE ON IS ABOUT BASIC CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ARE THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OWN BODY. HI THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN INTERSEX ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. AND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY INSTEAD OF HAVING OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THOSE YOUR REVERSIBLE SURGICAL CHOICES FOR ABOUT. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE HAVING A MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE ON YOUR BODY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME INPUT INTO WHETHER THAT HAPPENS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING OTHER PEOPLE. MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE THE PHYSICAL CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INPUT BECAUSE BABIES CAN'T TALK. TO BE CLEAR SENATE BILL TO A ONE IS NOT ABOUT REMOVING PARENTS WERE PHYSICIANS FROM THE DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE SURGERY PARENTS ORDER AND POSITIONS UNDER THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT INVOLVEMENT. INDEED PARENTS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. BUT RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION IF THE PERSON WHOSE BODY IS BEING PERMANENTLY CHANGE IRREVERSIBLY CHANGE. WHAT WE'RE SAYING UNDER THE AMENDMENT SO WE JUST PUT INTO THIS BILL THIS WEEK. IS THAT LET'S WAIT UNTIL SIX YEARS OLD. WHEN THAT CHILD CAN AT LEAST PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION AND HELP INFORM PARENTS DECISION ABOUT WHAT GENDER THE CHILD IDENTIFIES WITH. AND WHETHER% THAT CHILD WANTS TO HAVE MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY- A SURGERY IN ORDER TO CHANGE AND RECONSTRUCT THEIR GENITALS. ALL WE'RE ASKING COLLEAGUES IS FOR THE PERSON IMPACTED TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION WHEN YOU OPERATE ON A BABY. THAT PERSON CANNOT PARTICIPATE. AND TO BE CLEAR WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES ONLY WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS A MEDICAL PROBLEM THERE WAS A WITNESS LAST APRIL WHO CAME MEN. AND SHE TESTIFIED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE SURGERY. SHE HAS CAN GENERAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA AND WHEN SHE EXPLINS. THE PROBLEMS THE SHE WAS EXPERIENCE AS A BABY THAT SHE COULDN'T URINATE THAT IS A MEDICAL CONDITION AND THIS BILL WOULD NOT PRECLUDE THAT KIND OF SURGERY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PERFECTLY HEALTHY BABIES WHO DO NOT HAVE A HEALTH PROBLEM. BUT THEIR GENITALIA DO NOT CONFORM WITH WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE TYPICAL AND SO THERE IS AN EFFORT TO QUOTE ON QUOTE NORMALIZE THE LOCK. I WANT TO TRUST- COMMENT- ON THE KID AND WE PREFER SO I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR HAVING A VERY OPEN DOOR TO US OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS AGREED ON EVERYTHING- BUT THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME BOTH TO ME AND TO MY STAFF. AND TO OUR COALITION AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ABILITY- TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE I DO HOWEVER NEED TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH A FEW ASPECTS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND ANALYSIS- FIRST OF ALL THE IN ALICE'S SAYS THAT ARE THE DEFINITION SB TWO OH ONE OF INTER SOCKS. IS SOMEHOW INCONSISTENT WITH OTHER DEFINITIONS- WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT THIS DEFINITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE UNITED NATIONS DEFINITION AND THE DEFINITION- AS PUT FORWARD BY EVERY MAJOR INTERSEX GROUP IN THE WORLD. ON THE V. BUT THE HOUSE IS ALSO FOR- FOCUSES ON CHROMOSOMES WHETHER YOU'RE AX AX OR AXE WHITE. HI AND FRANKLY THIS ANALYSIS COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH EVER EVEN WITHOUT EVER EVEN MENTIONING THE CONCEPT OF CHROMOSOMES BECAUSE CHROMOSOMES OR 1100% RELEVANT TO GENDER. AND WE SEE THAT WITH TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN LET'S SAY AXE WHITE WITH A LET'S SAY A **** THAT. BERKELEY CONFORMS TO WHAT ODDS WITH SOCIETY THINGS APPEARS TO LOOK LIKE. AND A PERSON BY THE AGE OF FIVE IS IDENTIFYING AS A GIRL. ROOM ISMS ARE IRRELEVANT THE WAY THE GENERAL'S LOOK ARE RELEVANT TO SOMEONE'S GENDER AND WE SEE THAT. WITH THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHY THIS LEGISLATURE HAS OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED THE BILL AFTER BILL TO PROTECT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DON'T SAY THAT WE LOOK ONLY AT YOUR CHROMOSOMES ARE HOW YOUR GENITALS LOOK TO THE SIDE. WHAT GENDER YOU ARE AND WHETHER YOU SHOULD HAVE SURGERY TO RECONSTRUCT YOUR GENITALS IN A MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY WAY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOUR CHROMOSOMES ARE OR WHAT YOUR GENERALS. LOOK LIKE. THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE ANALYSIS DIAGNOSIS IS NOT PUT FORWARD AMENDMENTS BUT THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS OF. WHAT AMENDMENTS. COULD BE- IF WE WERE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION MORE THAN 80% OF INTERSEX PEOPLE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE PROTECTIONS OF THIS BILL. ON FOR MUCH OF HUMAN HISTORY PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN INTERSEX WHICH IS LEFT ALONE. BASIS LIVE THEIR LIVES AND THAT WAS THAT. IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO PERFORM MEDICALLY ON NECESSARILY SURGERIES TO QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMALIZE THESE CHILDREN. THE SURGERIES THREE VERY CLEAR ARE VERY INVASIVE AND RISKY SURGERIES IS RECONSTRUCTING SOMEONE'S GENITALS. ACOSTA CAN CAUSE PERMANENT STERILIZATION PERMANENT LOSS OF SEXUAL SENSATION FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES YOUR REVERSIBLE. PERMANENT URINARY TRACT ISSUES. AND THESE ARE SERIOUS POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS AND THAT'S WHY IT IS APART FROM ANY ISSUE OF GENDER. SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE INPUT ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND OF MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERY THAT COULD HAVE PROFOUND NEGATIVEIMPACTS ON THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND YET THEY HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WHETHER THEY WANTED TO HAVE THAT SURGERY. AND WHAT OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD WE ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION. AND SEPARATE FROM NOT BROADER ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT THE WRONG GENDER CAN BE A SIGN. THAT A DAUGHTER COULD SAY WELL YOUR AXE WHY AND THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE A **** AND A **** SO WE'RE JUST GONNA RECONSTRUCTED AND MAKE IT INTO A **** OR VICE VERSA. AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATE LATER THE KID SAYS BUT I'M A GIRL. WELL YOU CAN'T FIX IT THEN. MAYBE YOU CAN MAYBE POTENTIALLY A LITTLE BIT. BUT THAT IS A PERMANENT IRREVERSIBLE DECISION THAT WAS MADE FOR THAT CHILD NOT CHAO'S CAN HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO INPUT WHATSOEVER. NOW WE HAVE MADE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THIS WEEK- HOW WE SCALE BACK ARE THE BILL AROUND SOME- WHAT WERE CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY GRAY AREAS AROUND HYPOSPADIAS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS WE LISTENED AND WE HEARD. AND WE MADE SOME CHANGES. IN ADDITION ORIGINALLY THE BILL SAID YOU CAN'T PERFORM THE SURGERY UNTIL THE CHILD CAN PROVIDE QUOTE UNQUOTE INFORMED CONSENT. WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE BECAUSE OUT OF WELL DEVELOPED BODY OF CASE LAW BUT VARIOUS SENATORS AND OTHERS EXPRESSED- TO ME THAT- THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO VAGUE THAT A PHYSICIAN MAY NOT KNOW. WHAT'S INFORMED CONSENT. SO WE CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT A BRIGHT LINE SIX YEARS OLD. AND THE REASON THAT WE DID THAT WE COULD'VE GONE OLDER DOESN'T ARGUMENT TO SAY YOU CAN'T DO IT TOOK KIDS EIGHTEEN. BUT WE MADE IT SIX YEARS OLD WE THOUGHT IT WOULD STRIKE A BALANCE THE KID IS ABOUT TO START SCHOOL. FOR THE STILL VERY EARLY IN THEIR LIFE SO IF A SURGICAL DECISION IS MADE- IT'S STILL THE KID IS STILL VERY VERY. YOUNG BUT AT SIX YEARS OLD A CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WITH THEIR PARENTS. PARENTS ARE ABLE IN MAKING THE PARENTAL DECISION TO SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM THE CHILD. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF KIDS WHO WERE FOUR FIVE SIX ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING WHAT THEIR GENDER. IS BUT THAT'S MORE A MORE COMMON THESE DAYS. IN ADDITION KIDS CAN EXPRESS WHAT THEY WANT. DO THEY WANT THEIR GENITALS TO LOOK LIKE. THIS PERSON'S CHEN SAID DADDY OR MOMMY OR OR THEIR FRIENDS OR WHATEVER THEY CAN EXPRESS A AND SO THE PARENT. CAN MAKE THE DECISION AT LEAST HAVING THAT LEVEL OF INPUT FROM CHILD AND CAN DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT. THIS IS A LITTLE CONFUSING LET'S WAIT A LITTLE MORE LET'S DO IT- IN ADDITION THE PARENT BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT ALL PHYSICIANS. BUT THEREARE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE PARENTS THE CHILD IS BORN- AND THE AND THE- GENERALS ARE A TYPICAL. AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JUST HAPPENED AND WHAT'S GOING ON THEY NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE THEY DON'T KNOW. AND THAT A PHYSICIAN WILL SAY. IN THIS DOES HAPPEN. IF YOU DON'T DO THE SURGERY YOUR KIDS GOING TO BULLY THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE MESSED UP. AND FOR PARENTS PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE REVERE DOCTORS AS WE SHOULD THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAVING LIVES. AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY JUST GO WITH WHAT THE DOCTORS RECOMMENDING THIS WILL GIVE THEM A FEW YEARS. TO LOOK AT IT EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND MAKE AN INTEL GEN INFORMED DECISION. I WANT TO ALSO NOTE. I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND FOR THIS- PROFESSION IN GENERAL INCLUDING MY SISTER WHO IS A POSITION IN NEW YORK. ON AT AND THIS IS A PROFESSION THAT SAVE LOTS SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY IT'S A PROFESSION THAT I'M USUALLY ALIGNED WITH AND IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE. TO BE OFFICER- THE- MEDICAL PROFESSION I'LL BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU. BUT WE NEED TO ALSO BE CLEAR THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS VERY DIVIDED ON THIS ISSUE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DOCTORS AND WE HAVE ONE HERE TODAY INCLUDING UROLOGISTS. WHO THINK THAT THESE PROCEDURES SHOULD BE BANNED- YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE ASKING YOU TO PASS THIS BILL. YOU HAVE A LETTER- THAT IS SIGNED BY THREE FORMER UNITED STATES SURGEONS GENERAL. TO APPOINTED BY BILL CLINTON WON BY GEORGE W. BUSH. ALL AGREE NOT TO YOUR POSITION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE THE BUILDING EXIST WHEN THEY SIGNED THE LETTER. BUT ALL SAYING THAT THESE. PROCEDURES SHOULD BE BANNED BUT THERE'S NO REASON. TO HAVE THEM. ON THEY SAID MAKE STATEMENTS LIKE WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS BORN WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA WAS NO PHYSICAL RISK. TREATMENT SHOULD FOCUS NOT ON SURGICAL INTERVENTION BUT ON PSYCHOSOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT. BECAUSE MEDIC JANITOR PLASTER SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL CHILDREN ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOICE THEIR OWN VIEW. ABOUT WHETHER TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY. AND FEDERAL PLEASE REVIEW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR- IN YOUR MATERIALS. ON THE UNITED NATIONS AND ITS REPORT ON TORTURE. STATES QUOTE CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN WITH A TYPICAL SEX CHARACTERISTICS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO YOUR REVERSIBLE SUCKS ASSIGNMENT INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION. INVOLUNTARY JANET ON NORMALIZING SURGERY PERFORMED WITHOUT THEIR INFORMED CONSENT FOR THAT OF THEIR PARENTS EVEN. AN ATTEMPT TO QUOTE UNQUOTE FIX THEIR SOCKS. LEAVING THEM WITH PERMANENT YOUR REVERSIBLE AND INFERTILITY AND CAUSING SEVERE MENTAL SUFFERING. THE US STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS QUOTE INTERSEX PERSONS ROUTINELY FACE FORCE MEDICAL SURGERIES. THAT ARE CONDUCTED AT A YOUNG AGE WITHOUT FREE OR INFORMED CONSENT. PLEASE ENTER MENTIONS JEOPARDIZE OUR PHYSICAL INTEGRITY. AND ABILITY TO LIVE FREE THESE ARE NOT FRIENDS ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ARE MAINSTREAM CREDIBLE ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT WE'VE HEARD THAT CH CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA. SOMEHOW NOT INNER SOCKS ON THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WOULD DISAGREE BECAUSE THEY DEFINE IT AS- A CONDITION THAT LEADS TO INTERSEX. TRAITS OF THE SUGGESTION THAT CH AND ALSO HAD THE SPEEDIEST. BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF INTERSEX PEOPLE FROM THE BILL'S PROTECTIONS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING- THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT A COLLEAGUES WE ARE IN THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. THE VERY FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE FIRST HOUSE ON AN IMPORTANT. PRIORITY CIVIL RIGHTS BILL FOR THE INNER. COMMUNITY AND FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I ASK YOU TO MOVE THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY A SO THAT WE CAN YOU TO WORK- AND DO THE STAKEHOLDER OUTRAGE THAT WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT- WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY.

CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AND A CO SPONSOR OF SB TO A ONE. WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB TWO A ONE BECAUSE AT ITS CORE THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTING INDIVIDUALS A TIME TO BE OVER THEIR OWN BODY AND IN SOME CASES GENDER IDENTITY WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL OF OUR WORK REGARDING LGBT Q. CIVIL RIGHTS. THE ISSUE IS IN THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT NOW THE U. N. HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH THREE BIPARTISAN US SURGEON GENERAL THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS HAVE ALL CALLED ON THE WORLD TO TAKE ACTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS OF INTERSEX PEOPLE. IN JUST THE LAST WEEK CNN PUBLISHED A SHORT DOCUMENTARY HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING CHILDREN BORN WITH SEX TRADE VARIATIONS FROM THESE INTERVENTIONS AND SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THIS BILL AND YOUR VOTE TODAY. THE WORLD IS LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK SIMILAR BILLS BEING CONSIDERED FOR LEADERSHIP ON HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THAT LEADERSHIP TODAY EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF INTERSEX CHILDREN ARE BORN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND RIGHT NOW MEDICALLY ON NECESSARY INVENTIONS CAUSAL LASTING AND MINIMUM ARM ARE FORMED ON GENDER OR THEY COULD. SPEAK WHICH IS A CLEAR. RIGHTS VIOLATION. I'M NOT A NURSE PEOPLE ARE LGBT Q. MANY ARE. MORE ISSUES OF SELF DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT A PERSON'S GENDER IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION SEX AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR ALL COURTS WERE% MISSION AND ALLOWING INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER PEOPLE.

THAT IT'S NOT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE TO TELL PROFESSIONS WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO BUT I REJECT THAT AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE ROLE OF THIS COMMITTEE. THOSE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PROTECTED LGBTQ YOUTH FROM SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PROTECTED FEMALE INMATES FROM FOR STERILIZATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS PROTECTED MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS FROM ELECTRO SHOCK THERAPY. IF WE CAN'T AGREE THAT THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAN RESPECTFULLY WHAT ARE WE ALL DOING HERE. THE WORLD IS WATCHING THE INTERSEX THE STILL RIGHTS AND THE LGBT Q. COMMUNITIES ARE WATCHING WILL CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO LEAD ON HUMAN RIGHTS OR ARE WE GONNA SEE THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE TO THE YORK I RESPECTFULLY ADD. ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICK NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS BRIANNA BROWN KING AND I WAS BORN WITH CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA C. H. FOR SHORT. THIS MEANS THAT MY BODY DOESN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH CORTISOL A STRESS HORMONE THAT OUR BODIES NEED TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. AND TO COMPENSATE MY BODY NATURALLY PRODUCES HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE. TESTOSTERONE PRODUCES WHAT WE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS SECONDARY MALE CHARACTERISTICS I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE ME BY PASSING SB TWO OH ONE AND PROTECTING FUTURE INTERSECT CHILDREN FROM THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT I WENT THROUGH AS A RESULT OF DEEPLY HARMFUL SURGERY I UNDERWENT AS A CHILD. CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AGENCIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY SWITZERLAND AUSTRALIA CHILE AND THE U. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. AND RESPECTED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS ON PROTECTING CHILDREN. INCLUDING THE UNITED NATIONS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FORMER US SURGEON GENERAL PHYSICIANS. PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. AFTER STUDYING THE ISSUE ALL OF THESE GOVERNMENT AND NGO GROUPS CONCLUDED THAT THESE MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES SHOULD BE PLUS POSTPONED UNTIL CHAU CHILDREN ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO UNDERGO SURGERY. THE SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ACTUALLY REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. PARENTS AND DOCTORS WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT INTERSEX CHILDREN'S BODIES BECAUSE THEY DEEM IT MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY BASED ON THEIR FEAR OF OUR HEALTHY BODIES. HOWEVER WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WE ARE PERFECT AS WE ARE. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CASES LIKE MINE AND SO MANY OTHERS WERE SURGERY DOESN'T GO AS PLANNED. OR WHAT HAPPENS YEARS LATER WHEN THEIR DAUGHTERS REALIZE THAT THEY CAN'T EXPERIENCE FOR SEXUAL PLEASURE. BECAUSE THAT RIGHT WAS STOLEN FROM THEM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. OR KNOWLEDGE. THE UROLOGIST TO PERFORM MY SURGERY A SHORT MY FAMILY IN THE UNDER GORING UNDERGOING A VAGINAL CLASS THE TO MAKE MY GENITALS APPEAR MORE NORMAL. WOULD ENABLE ME TO BE ABLE TO USE MY **** I DON'T KNOW WHY HE SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW I WOULD OR WOULD NOT WANT TO USE MY **** WHY ARE DOCTORS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PREPARING US TO HAVE SEX. WITH THEIR HUSBANDS AND ACTUALLY HAVING A HEALTHY BODY CAPABLE OF SEXUAL PLEASURE. THESE HIGH RISK IN A REVERSIBLE SURGERIES ARE PERFORMED TO. CONFIRM OUR BODIES TO GENDER EXPECTATIONS OFTEN WITHOUT PATIENTS HAVING LITTLE OR NO SAY IN THIS PERSONAL DECISION. TO DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY TREATMENT OR SURGERY IS APPROPRIATE FOR US. THEY MAY WELL THEY MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED BUT THE SURGERIES ARE OFTEN CARRIED OUT WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS WHAT THE CHILDREN WHAT ONE AS ADULTS. IN MY CASE I NEVER DID USE MY **** IN THE WAY THAT THE DOCTOR SOON I WOULD BECAUSE MOST OF MY INTIMATE PARTNERS HAVE BEEN CISGENDER WOMEN. INSTEAD OF PREPARE ME FOR **** MY UROLOGIST COULD HAVE. AFFIRMED THAT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY INTERSECT BODY. I STARTED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIES INTERSECTS BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHAT THE TERM WAS. I KNEW THAT I WAS DIFFERENT EVEN THOUGH MY FAMILY AND MY DOCTORS TRIED TO TRIED HARD TO CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE. EVENTUALLY I REALIZED THAT I WASN'T JUST A NORMAL GIRL. THAT EVERYONE IN MY LIFE WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE. C. H. MANIFEST ITSELF DIFFERENTLY FOR EVERYONE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG INTERSEXUAL DURING. TO GO THROUGH THE NATURAL STAGES OF HUMAN AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BEFORE MAKING A DECISION THAT COULD IMPACT THEIR LIVES FOR EVER. BECAUSE SOMETIMES CAN DOCTORS DO YOU GET IT WRONG. I AM THE CHILD OF A MOTHER WHO TRULY THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING WHAT WAS BEST FOR ME. BUT GOT IT WRONG. I HONESTLY WOULD HAVE KEPT MY LARGE **** HAD I KNOWN THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW. WHEN IT COMES TO NON NECESSARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES CHILDREN DESERVE. TO BE OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BODIES. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO CENTER WIENER FOR INTRODUCING A BILL THAT WOULD HELP PRESERVE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. AND DELAY MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES UNTIL PATIENTS CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THESE DECISIONS AND DETERMINE WHAT TREATMENT OR SURGERY IS RIGHT FOR THEM. CHILDREN BORN IN CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED AGAINST INJUSTICE AND NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SEE JUSTICE JUSTICE FOR THE RIGHT WAY FOR THEIR OWN BODY. IT'S TIME TO SEND CENTER CARE ON THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS THEMSELVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA. INVITE THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO- TO COME AND SHARE THEIR VIEWS IF YOU CAN CLEAR A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE THE TABLE OUT OF THEM WE MAY HAVE. WELCOME BACK ABOUT. OKAY. SO TO THE TO THE OPPONENTS ARE WE DID ALLOW THE SUPPORTERS TO GO OVER- WE HAD ALLOCATED FOR MINUTES- TO THEM AND THEY WENT TO SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES SO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO. HAVE EQUAL TIME HERE AND- MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN. GIVE US INSIGHT Là AGENT BUT IN SEVEN ADMINISTER LOTS OF WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB TO A ONE MY NAME IS HILARY COP I AM A CALIFORNIAN I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE. I'M LGBT. I AM A PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST THAT YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO. MY DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY IS ONE THAT SPECIALIZES IN TREATING CHILDREN WITH DIFFERENCES IN SEX DEVELOPMENT ALSO KNOWN AS DST. I CHOSE A CAREER IN MEDICINE BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE LEAD HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER LIVES. AND I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR WORK. MUCH OF WHICH ENTAILS ADVOCATING FOR OUR PATIENTS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES MAKING INDIVIDUALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH PATIENT BY EDUCATING FAMILIES SO THEY CAN ACT IN THEIR CHILD'S BEST INTEREST. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SB TWO OH ONE HOWEVER TREATS EVERY CHILD THE SAME IGNORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DELAYED TREATMENT. SENATE BILL TWO OH ONE PROHIBITS ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR ALL CHILDREN BORN WITH VARIATIONS IN SEX CHARACTERISTICS UNTIL THE AGE OF SIX. IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T JUST IMPACT THE FEW RARE INTERSECTS CASES. BUT INSTEAD TREATS ROUTINE AND COMPLEX CASES EQUALLY. IN DOING SO THE BILL REMOVES ALL FLEXIBILITY FOR TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR LOVED ONES TO DO WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. THE BILL DOES PROVIDE A PATH FOR TREATMENT DEEMED MEDICALLY NECESSARY THE BILL CHARGES THE MEDICAL BOARD IN CONJUNCTION WITH A DEFINED COMMITTEE OF TEN TO DETERMINE WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ROUTINE AND COMPLEX CASES. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT PLACE IS THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE HANDS OF A FEW. THEY CANNOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH PATIENT SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT WHICH THEY ARE MAKING A DECISION. AN ODDLY ONLY A FEW OF THE INDIVIDUALS DETERMINING MEDICAL CARE OR EVEN REQUIRED TO BE PHYSICIANS LET ALONE SPECIALISTS WHO CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN. TREATMENT OF DST HAS ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MANY SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL SITE CASES FROM OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO AS JUSTIFICATION TO PASS THIS BILL. OUR SPECIALTY AND THE LARGER MEDICAL COMMUNITY CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND STUDY THESE COMPLEX CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE CARE FOR PATIENTS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY. WE NOW HAVE A RIGOROUS TEAM BASED APPROACH INVOLVING MULTI MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH RESOURCES AND IMPORTANTLY CHOICES. SURGERY IS NOT ALWAYS RECOMMENDED IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE OPTIONS AND DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SB- ONE REMOVES THIS SB TWO OH ONE REMOVES THIS. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE SENATORS CAN INTENT I AM CONCERNED THAT WITHHOLDING TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR COMPLEX MEDICAL CASES WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CHILDREN THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. SENATE BILL TWO OH ONE IS THE WRONG APPROACH AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAREN BOGARD I'M A LIFELONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENT A BOARD MEMBER AND IMMEDIATE PAST BOARD CHAIR OF CARES FOUNDATION AND MOTHER OF A SON WHO HAS SOUGHT WASTING CAN GENERAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA RCH. AT THE TIME OUR THIRD SON WAS BORN WE KNEW SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT HE WAS VOMITING LOSING WEIGHT AND BECOMING MORE LETHARGIC BUT WE HAD NO IDEA HE HAD C. H. UNTIL HE NEARLY DIED OF AN ADRENAL CRISIS AT THREE WEEKS OF AGE. THAT EXPERIENCE WAS NOT UNUSUAL AT THE TIME FORTUNATELY THAT'S NOW RARE IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF CARES FOUNDATION WHO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR CH NEWBORN SCREENING. IN ALL FIFTY STATES C. H. IS A LIFE THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITION THAT AFFECTS BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. BUT CERTAINLY DOES NOT IMPACT EACH PATIENT EQUALLY THEIR VARIOUS FORMS OF C. H. SOME OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO VARIATIONS IN SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE PATIENTS HOWEVER ARE GENETICALLY MALE OR FEMALE AND THE VAST MAJORITY DO NOT IDENTIFY AS INTERSEX. THIS BILL HAS CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED CH WITHIN ITS DEFINITION EVEN AFTER THE MAJORITY OF THE C. H. COMMUNITY HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR IT TO BE REMOVED. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH CH DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND OPPOSE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO CARING FOR THOSE WITH THIS COMPLICATED MEDICAL CONDITION. IT'S TROUBLING TO C. H. FAMILIES WHO HAVE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING ANOTHER CHILD WITH C. H. TO THINK THAT THIS BILL COULD RESTRICT ANY TREATMENT UNTIL THE ARBITRARY AGE OF SIX. AND JUSTICE TROUBLING TO FOR ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY QUESTIONS TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN OR TREATED THEIR CHILD. HERE'S FOUNDATION AND I ARE NOT ADVOCATES FOR SURGERY OR MANDATING ANY PARTICULAR TREATMENT. WE BELIEVE FAMILY SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN WITH ALL AVAILABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS AND WITHOUT THE HARSH RESTRICTIONS IN SENATE BILL TO A ONE. BECAUSE OF MY BOARD INVOLVEMENT I KNOW FULL WELL HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR WOMEN WHO ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR TREATMENT AT AN EARLY AGE TO COME FORWARD. AND SHARE SUCH PERSONAL MEDICAL STORIES IN A PUBLIC FORUM. IT'S IMPORTANT THEY HAVE A VOICE. GIRLS WITH CH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY THE LARGEST GROUP AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. AS A GROUP THEY OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSE SB TO A ONE. ON BEHALF OF CH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB TWO OH ONE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS BOGART AND THANK YOU DOCTOR COP FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'D LIKE TO INVITE. OTHERS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND- AND DO A ME TOO ON- WITH YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION IF ANY. GOOD AFTERNOON MATT BACK REPRESENT A SOCIETY OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY AND THE OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THAT WOULD WANT TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA CLOSE THA A PART OF OUR PUBLIC HEARING AT INVITES. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASK. THE QUESTIONS. OKAY. NOT I WILL GO AHEAD DOCTOR SENATOR PAT. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR THE CONVERSATION AND YOU KNOW I DID VOTE FOR THE RECALL RESOLUTION. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THAT IN TERMS OF. THIS. THEY'RE ALL AND WE'RE NOW SAYING THAT IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR PERFORM ANY SORT OF MEDICAL TREATMENT- NOW THIS HE SAID MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY AND I THINK THAT'S THE RUB EXACTLY HOW WE DEFINE SO PERHAPS AND I KNOW THAT THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- AND- STRENGTH LIKE IN YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW DR. HILLARY COP OKAY BACK DOCTOR COP- CAN YOU DESCRIBE HE'S TALKED ABOUT MULTI THIS MAY PROCESS CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THE CURRENT. STATE OF THE ART IS THE CURRENT PROCESS YOUR UCSF- WHEN A CHILD IS BORN WITH L. INTERSECTION ASIAN YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT CHROMOSOMES IT'S- SO YOU HAVE A CHILD WHO HAS I GUESS WE CALL A TYPICAL IS RIGHT WORD- BUT- GENITALIA WHAT WHAT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH- YOU EVALUATE THAT PATIENT. AND HOW ARE DECISIONS MADE ABOUT WHICH TREATMENTS INCLUDING PROCEDURES. SHOULD BE DONE MORE URGENTLY AND WHICH ONES. CAN CAN WAIT. AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S- I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CASE TO SAY THAT WELL WHAT'S THE RUSH RIGHT OUT FOR MANY OF THESE THINGS. SO HOW HOW'S THAT. CURRENTLY DONE- NOW SO IF YOU HAD A PATIENT WHO WAS BORN- AND DAY CONSULT YOU NOW AND THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW A PIE HAPPENED LAST WEEK WHAT WE PUT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS MORE. YOU'RE VERY CORRECT ON THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WHERE WE JUST LOOK AT IT AND SAY THIS PATIENT LOOKS LIKE A BOY OR A GIRL AND DECIDE ON SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN FACT- WE THIS IS ABOUT CHOICE. THIS IS. A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS AND- DECISION- DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. THE MULTI MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM INVOLVES- PHYSICIANS- FROM VARIOUS SPECIALTIES INCLUDING PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY PSYCHIATRY GENETICS. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE CHROMOSOMES BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE CHROMOSOMES ABOUT THE GONADS IT'S ABOUT THE- PHYSICAL APPEARANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER. BUT WE SPEND ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME AND OF SPENT YEARS STUDYING THIS AND IT IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX PROCESS THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN PEOPLE THREE OF WHICH- OUR PHYSICIANS THAT MOST LIKELY ARE NOT FROM THE SPECIFIC SPECIALTIES THAT HAVE SPENT ALL THIS TIME STUDYING THESE CONDITIONS AND CONTINUING TO STUDY THEM. THE BABY IS BORN- THERE IS NOTHING IMMEDIATELY DONE FOR THE BABY OTHER THAN MEDICAL TREATMENTS THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS SUCH AS SALT WASTING CH. OF THE BABY WERE SENT HOME AND THIS WAS NOT IDENTIFIED IN MEDICAL TREATMENTS WERE GIVEN THE BABY WOULD WOULD DIE FROM A CRISIS AT HOME. THEY CAN GET INFECTIONS AND DIE FROM OVERWHELMING STRESS AT THIS CAUSES IN THE BODY. THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO IMMEDIATE- DECISIONS MADE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE VISITS IN MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WITH MULTIPLE PHYSICIANS OF ALL SPECIAL. ON A- US. THREE AND IN FACT. VERY RARELY ARE WE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT SURGERY THAT IS JUST AN OPTION AND IF WE EXCLUDE THESE OPTIONS WILL HAVE PATIENTS NOT WALKING INTO OUR DOORS AND IN FACT. GOING ELSEWHERE IN IN IN IT WILL BE THAT PEOPLE WITH LESS MEANS THAT ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PLACES TO HAVE- THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL IN FACT SUFFER BUT THE PEOPLE WHO STILL WANT SURGERY AND KNOW THAT IT'S THERE ARE GOING TO GO ELSEWHERE. FOR US THIS IS NOT ABOUT SURGERY WE DON'T WE'RE NOT HERE FOR SURGERY OR AGAINST SURGERY AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE'RE NOT. PERFORMING THE SURGERIES. THAT ARE BEING INSINUATED- WE ARE OFFERING. ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS AND IN FACT WHEN WE ARE UNSURE OF DIAGNOSES THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME AND CLINICS SUCH AS THIS THAT ARE AT. MULTI THAT MULTI DISCIPLINE CONNECTS OUR AT OUR AT ACADEMIC CENTERS WHEN WE ARE ENSURE WE ARE WE ARE NOT OFFERING SURGERY. IT'S IT WE ARE DISCUSSING SURGERY AND THAT IS AND WE'RE NOT PUSHING IT IT'S AN OPTION OKAY SIDE OF AYE CLARIFIED BECAUSE WHEN. ONE OF THE CONTENTIONS WAS IS THAT. PHYSICIANS ARE PUSHING ACT BE PUSHING PERRANCE THING THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX THIS YOU'RE SAYING THAT. I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND I'VE YOU KNOW IS WHAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THIS LAWS ABOUT NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE RIGHT AND ONE. YEAH ONE OF THE- MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT BEING A SURGEON IS NEVER PUSHING AN AGENDA OR A SURGERY THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOW WE- THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE IT'S AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT THE DECISION IS MADE AND IT'S AN INFORMED DECISION THAT'S MADE TOGETHER THERE'S SHARED DECISION MAKING THAT OCCURS WITH THE FAMILY. AND KNOW WHERE WE ARE PUSHING ANY AGENDA IT'S ABOUT OPTIONS AND EDUCATION- AND ANY THEN YOU JUST CLARIFY- SO ONE OF THE SITUATIONS THAT I THINK THE PROPONENTS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN I THINK REASONABLE CONCERN IS THAT OKAY. CHILD BORN PARENT. ANXIOUS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ASKED OAK HILL THAT THAT MIGHT MY ANSWER TO PEOPLE AS KIDS LIKE LET'S WRAP OR SCORE THE MOST USED AS BOY OR GIRL RIGHT. AND THEN THEY GET AND- THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET AN ANSWER AND SOON CERTAIN PARENTS THE ONLY DEPENDING ON THEIR BACKGROUND- ARE- SO FORTH MAY WANT TO. PUSH FOR SURGERY TO RESOLVE THAT QUESTION HAVE YOU AND YOUR PS CRAWLERS HAVE YOU EVER TOLD. NOT MAYBE IT'S BEST TO WAIT WE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED RIGHT NOW I MEAN IT DO YOU ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE SURGERY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILD ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND IN FACT WE DON'T EVEN ASSIGNED GENDERS WHEN WORKERS. WE TALK ABOUT THE BABY. TALK ABOUT FOR RIGHT NOW IT'S SO MUCH HARDER TO ASSIGN A GENDER AND COME BACK WITH OUR OF SO MANY THINGS. THAT WEREN'T SURE ABOUT THIS SUCH A COMPLEX ISSUE. AND OF COURSE WE WANT RIGHT THERE WE NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING WE FULLY ARMY. ANY ANY. THERE IS A SIGNED AND REFERRING TO THE TO THE CHILD AS THE BABY. AND THEN THAT FURTHER TESTING WILL NEED TO HAPPEN INCLUDING A GENETIC TESTING HORMONAL TESTING AND THEN WE HAVE A VERY SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT WE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS WE DO A LINE THEM WITH- ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEY CAN TALK TO OTHER FAMILIES ARE ALSO GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS. OKAY AND THEN FINALLY. SO SOMEONE MIGHT SAY OKAY WELL YOU KNOW THIS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU DO THIS BILL DOESN'T. DO ANYTHING STOP YOU FROM DOING THAT SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL SO WHAT WHAT IS IT WHAT WOULD THIS BILL IT BECAME LAW STOP YOU FROM DOING THAT MIGHT BE HARMFUL TO THE CHILD. WELL FIRST OF ALL AGAIN. I THINK IT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THINGS AND PERCENT OPTIONS. IN INFORMED THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS. IT ALSO IS VERY BROAD AND IN IN OUR OPINION IS GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT WE KNOW. TO MEAN INTERSEX AND WE WILL CERTAINLY SAY THAT THIS IS A THIS IS OF A VERY QUIET COMPLEX CONDITION OF MANY CONDITIONS THAT THE POTENTIALLY CAN- MAKE UP THE DEFINITION OF INTERSEX AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE SUCH VARIATIONS IN THE INCIDENCE OF INTERNET INTERSEX WILL. WILL HEAR OF ANYWHERE FROM. 1% TWO VERSES ONE AND A FORTY FIVE HUNDRED WHICH WOULD BE MORE- REALISTIC AND HOW WE VIEW INTERSECTS BUT CERTAINLY. TO AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THERE ARE BY MANY PEOPLE- WITH A CH THE DO NOT FEEL THAT INTERSEX- IS AT THAT CH IS AN INTERSEX CONDITION AND IN FACT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THAT 95% OF- OF FIVE C. H. PATIENTS THAT ARE- RAISED AS FEMALE IDENTIFY AS FEMALE AND A FEW PRCENT. HAVE A GENDER ISSUES- ABOUT ONE PERCENT- AND THAT'S A DOCUMENTED STUDY ACTUALLY IN THE REPORT FOR TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE- BYE DESTINED IN COLLEAGUES. AND ALSO- HYPOSPADIAS HYPOSPADIAS IS IN AND OF ITSELF A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE YES SOMETIMES IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERSEX BUT- ABOVE AND BY FAR. THE MAJORITY OF HYPE IS BADIUS THAT WE SEE AND TREAT I IS NOT A PART OF AN INNER SIX CONDITION AND I THINK. TO LIMIT US IN AND BUY A BROADLY SAYING AND INCLUDING THOSE THOSE SAID BOTH CH HYPOSPADIAS OR EVEN TRYING TO. NAIL DOWN SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ALREADY CONFUSION AND THAT AND SO I HAVE EXTREME- CONCERNED THAT IF WE LEGISLATE THIS ISSUE THAT THERE ARE TO BE A GENERATION OF CHILDREN. WHOSE PURPOSE ON CONSEQUENCES. BUT WE ARE. OKAY SO- I'VE KATE. BY YOUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS- NIGHT. I THANK THE BROADNESS IS A BIT CONCERNING I. AGAIN AN EXAMPLE THAT AND FOR CHAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT IS THAT WE A CHILD WHO IS BORN- THE PARENTS REQUESTED A CIRCUMCISION I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MIGHT FEEL CIRCUMCISION IS A MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE. AND WHILE PERFORMING THE ARKHAM CITY DISCOVER THE CHAO'S TYPE STATUS SO WE CAN TELL BEFORE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT OUT AND- PUT. DECISION TO PERFORM THE CONCISION BECAUSE THEY PERFORM THE PROCEDURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD. FIGHT AS MEDICAL NECESSARY. NOW YES. BECAUSE THAT OUT ALSO HAS TYPE OF SPEED IS NOW WE DISCOVERED IT DURING THE IT WAS NOT HAVE TO BE SEVERELY COVERED DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CIRCUMCISION. BUT I THINK THE BIGGER EASE IS IT IS HIS BEST BET CONCERNING. NOW ARE CERTAINLY FALL UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I THINK FIFTY AND TEN THE BILL AND WHERE WE WANT TO GO IS IN LINE WITH I THINK WE'RE THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO GO FOR THE STRAIGHT TALK TO MAC MANY MY OWN COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION- I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT THE LAWS A BLUNT INSTRUMENT. AND TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS INTO LAW AND IT'S NOT LIKE BECAUSE I KNOW BUT ALSO IS COME UP IS FOR EXAMPLE CONVERSION THERAPY THERE IS. PRETTY MUCH IN AN ENTITY AS MUCH AS THERE CAN BE IN THE YOU KNOW ABOUT COLON AT ALL TO FASHION A CONVERSION THERAPY IS BUNK AND THAT IT I'M FULL ON THAT SO FORTH. AND IF YOU THIS SPACE WITHIN WERE TRYING TO SWEEP OF A LOT DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S A LOT OF. GOOD REASONS FOR THIS THAT THAT WAS AN INTENT OF THE BILL. BUT I THINK CONCERNS IT'S ALSO WE CAN ALLOW OTHERS. THAT EIGHTY. I THINK SO MUCH OKAY. THAT JUST MONTH PLEASE I WANT TO GO TO OTHER SENATORS BUT I DO WILL DO A FOLLOW UP TO DOCTOR COP IN IN MAY BE UNFAIR BUT- TO ASK YOU THIS A GIVEN YOU HAVE A IF YOU PRACTICE AT UCSF. BUT A CRITICISM OF THESE PROCEDURES AT THE SUPPORTERS SAY THAT THE SURGERIES ARE OCCURRING AT A MAJOR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE- CHALLENGING YOUR ASSERTION INTERNET NOT WHAT YOU DO AT UCSF BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER THESE ARE OCCURRING IN OTHER HOSPITALS. WELL I THERE ARE. ACROSS YOU ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR THAT MATTER THESE- DST MULTI DISCIPLINARY CLINICS- EXIST ON A IT ALL OF THE ACADEMIC. THE MAJORITY THE ACADEMICS AS WITH IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH. THE END ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IS AGAIN WHAT. IT IS WHICH SURGERIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE MEDICALLY INDICATED- INTERVENTIONS FOR- WIN THE URETHRA AND THE **** ARE ARE ARE A SINGLE CHANNEL THE EXIT ON TO THE PERINEUM WHICH IS THIS OUT OUTER SURFACE OF THE BODY. AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS THIS THESE CHANNELS ARE SEPARATED NOT ONLY TO LIMIT URINARY TRACT INFECTION BUT YOU COULD IMAGINE MENSTRUATING THROUGH A SINGLE HOLE AND PLACING A TAMPON AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU URINATE- OF FILLING AT THAT YOU. POOR DRAINAGE AND- STATE STENOSIS WHICH IS NEARING OF THAT CHANNEL CAN- AGAIN BECAUSE DIFFICULTY WITH URINATION IN THE URINE GOING UP INTO THE **** AND UTERUS AND DILATING THE **** OVERTIME- THOSE SURGERIES OF MOST LIKELY PERFORMED AT- IT INSTITUTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES WELL LET ME TRY TO NARROW UNDER YOUR DEFINITION OF INTERSECTS AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE IT. SO THE IN ON YOU MISSION OKAY AND I KNOW WE'LL GET TO THAT BUT UNDER YOUR DEFINITION OF WHAT INTEREST SEXY IS NOT OTHER PROCEDURES THAT AS WE TALKING ABOUT. ARE THOSE ARE. ARE THOSE PROCEDURES HAPPENING AT AT- WITHOUT THE SAME INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT YOU HAVE AT UCSF AND AT OTHER HOSPITALS FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE. I DON'T THINK THAT I COULD. FOR CERTAIN COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE OCCURRING AT OTHER I THINK THE MAJORITY RIGHT THEN THE TRADE DEFINITELY WHEN A CHILD IS BORN WITH THE INTERSECTS DEFINITION AS YOU DEFINE IT. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICALLY A SURPRISE OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICALLY A SCENE- DURING THE PREGNANCY SO THAT WHEN THAT CHILD IS BORN UNDER YOUR DEFINITION INTEREST TAX THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITIES WHERE OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. SO THAT ALSO. WILL GIVE A COMPLEX ANSWER A CASE SOMETIMES WE WILL KNOW ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS BEFORE THE CHILD IS BORN AND OTHER TIMES WE WON'T SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A CHILD WITH. THAT IS PREVIOUSLY HAD A SIBLING BORN WAS CH THERE'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT AND OTHER THAN OTHER CHILD WILL BE BORN WITH CH. THERE OCCASIONALLY TIMES WHEN WE CAN SEE ON PRENATAL ULTRASOUND. THE CHILD LOOKS LIKE IT HAS OF A PHALLIC LIKE TRUE WOULD BE A- NUMBER TO SHOWS THAT THEIR EXECS. THERE OCCASIONALLY TIMES WHEN WERE ALERTED. AHEAD OF TIME BUT THERE ARE ALSO TIMES WHEN A CHILD IS BORN- AND THAT. WE ARE THAT IT ISN'T IT IS NOT KNOWN THAT THE CHILD. IS INTERSEX UNTIL THE CHILD IS BORN NOT ALL OF MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA HAPPENS IN OUR MAJOR URBAN CITIES WITH MAJOR URBAN HOSPITALS SO AND RURAL SETTINGS- AREN'T AREN'T WE VULNERABLE WITHOUT SOME PHYSICIAN. WHO ISN'T AS EDUCATED OR DOESN'T HAVE THE INTER DISCIPLINARY. AROUND THEM TO. PERFORM SURGERY. GREAT THANK. YOU HAVE A- REFERRAL SYSTEM IN THE TIME WE HEARD THAT THE CHILDREN THAT WERE TREATING WITH AN RDSP CLIPPER NOT COMING OFF FROM SAN FRANCISCO. SO THOSE CHILDREN NUMBER IRVINE. AMONG CALL VERY FREQUENTLY I GET IS FROM STE THIS. PLACE THROUGHOUT MODESTO. WHERE OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BORN IN THERE QUESTION ABOUT THEIR GENITALIA AND WE HAVE THEM TRANSFERRED OR A IF THEY'RE STABLE- THEY CAN THEY CAN BE DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL FOLLOW BERNARD IDEAS DE CLINIC OKAY AND I WANT TO CORRECT MYSELF BECAUSE I KNOW LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT HERE AND I USE THE TERM UNNECESSARY SURGERY AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID- I SHOULD HAVE SAID- SEX ASSIGNMENT AT SURGERY WHICH IS AYE. WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE- LEAST I ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD AS ESSENCE OF THE BILL SEX ASSIGNMENT THAT DAY. THAT GOD LIKE ACT RIGHT OF HURRYING- WITHOUT AT REAL REASON. OUR OUR REFLUX IN THESE SITUATIONS IS NOT TO OPERATE WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IRREPARABLE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PERFORM SEX ASSIGNMENT SURGERY WE DO OUR VERY VERY BEST. TO ASSESS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GENETICS ENDOCRINOLOGY SITE IN A PSYCHIATRY ALL OF THIS AND MULTIPLE VISITS WITH FAMILIES AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION WE'RE NOT OPERATING. ALL RIGHT. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THOUGHT TO CHIU BACK COULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. THE THAT'S BEEN A LOT FROM OF OTHER WOMEN WE'RE GONNA GET THE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME THE WAY THAT I WHAT I THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER UROLOGIST HERE WHO I THINK HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE DON'T DO CHIU BUCKET ALSO RESPOND TO THESE QUESTIONS RATHER THAN JUST HAVING. A ONE SIDED AT. AT THE CENTER LEYVA IS ASKING SPECIFICALLY DOCTORS YOU THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO. RESPOND THANK YOU ARE STILL HELLO EVERYONE- AND YOU KNOW MY NAME IS BARBARA CHIU BACK. I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF UROLOGY AT THE ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI IN NEW YORK. ON MY CLINICAL PRACTICE RESEARCH TEACHING ARE FOCUSED ON THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN ADULTS SO JUST TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT A PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST. BUT I WAS FIRST EXPOSED TO THE CONTROVERSY AROUND SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF INTERSEX. EARLY IN MY MEDICAL CAREER WISE APPLYING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL I'M AND THIS AWARENESS MOTIVATED NOT ONLY MY INTERESTING GOING INTO UROLOGY BUT ALSO MY DECISION TO DEFER RESIDENCY. TO FIRST PURSUE A FELLOWSHIP AND DEGREE IN BIOETHICS SO I BRING A BOTH THOSE PERSPECTIVES TO OUR DISCOURSE TODAY. ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CAME UP. IN THE COURSE OF THAT THE BACK AND FORTH ON. SO MANY I TRIED TO TAKE NOTES SO I WOULD MISS ANYTHING BUT FORGIVE ME I MIGHT HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK AS OUR CONVERSATION CONTINUES. ON YEAH WITH. IN THE NUMBER OF FUNDING WHICH HAS TO MONNING TO THE TO THIS ARE TO THIS BILL- THERE WAS A CONFLATION OF MEDICAL AND SURGICAL CARE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT NO ONE NOTHING IN THIS BILL IS LIMITING MEDICAL CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH THE SP ON. THE TO CONTINUE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT LIMITING SURGERY IS DONE BEFORE SIX YEARS OF AGE ON. THE HERE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED OF IDENTIFYING A HYPE THE SPEEDIEST AT THE MOMENT OF CIRCUMCISION ON THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL WHICH VERY EXPLICIT LEAD DOES NOT ADDRESS QUESTIONS OF DESPITE THE SPEEDIEST ON HERE WITH. THE. QUESTION OF WHAT IS AND IS NOT MEDICALLY NEEDED- IT IS OF COURSE A VERY THORNY ONE ON AND. IT WAS CERTAINLY THE- THERE IS ROOM FOR CRITICISM OF THE BILL'S PROPOSAL THAT'D BE PUSHED TO A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. YOU FOR EXAMPLE DR **** MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF THE UROGENITAL SINUS WHERE THERE IS A COMBINED CHANNEL FOR THE EXIT OF URINE AND MEN SEIZE ON THAT ISSUE OF THE MENSTRUAL FLUID BEING A BEING A PROBLEMATIC ON DOESN'T ARISE. BEFORE AGE SIX CHILDREN OR ARE YOU EVEN WITH THAT IT'S GETTING EARLIER AND EARLIER- YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT THE USUAL SITUATION AND THAT A SIX YEAR OLD IS GOING TO BE GRAPPLING WITH THAT PROBLEM. AND SO THERE IS SPACE TO PAUSE WITHOUT INJURY TO THESE CHILDREN ON AND FINALLY I SAID THE TERM INVENTIONS OF VERY VERY ASTUTELY THAT MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS ARE SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY OUR OUR PROFESSION THAT HAS- CALLED FOR NOW. FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THAT THEY ARE OBSERVE MORE IN THE BREACH THAN IN THE OBSERVANCE OF WONDERFUL ACADEMIC CENTERS LIKE UCSF YES HAVE YOU ROBUST AND TRULY MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT EVEN AT MOST ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IS. A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM IS A UROLOGIST AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND NOT THE FULL ARRAY OF PERSONNEL THAT DOCTOR COP DESCRIBES AT UCSF AND THAT THE BILL. PRESCRIBED ACT THE MEDICAL BOARD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU RELIGION UNDER TO BACK I WANT INVITE OTHER SENATORS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I DO HAVE SOME THAT I'M HOLDING AND THEN WILL AND BY THE AUTHOR TO ENGAGE FURTHER. A CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. I JUST DR COP I AGREE AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SAY THAT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND CHILDREN WILL SUFFER PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES IF THIS BILL PASSES I WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT AND SAY THAT I THINK THAT CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING PROPELLANT PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES NOW. I THINK THE BILL YOU YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK ON IT I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT DO SOME MORE WORK ON IT I THINK IT IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ISSUE BUT IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN'S LIVES TO BECOME ADULTS AND IF WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT THEN THERE ARE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES SO- I HEAR BOTH SIDES YOU'RE BOTH VERY PASSIONATE I DO WORRY THAT AT- AT THAT HOSPITAL IS NOT A TEACHING HOSPITAL. THAT MAYBE THERE ISN'T THE- JUST THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE ISSUE THAT IS GIVEN AT- AT A HOSPITAL LIKE UCSF. AND IF WE EVER HAD JUST LEADERS CAN'T DO SOMETHING TO HELP THE PROCESS AND TRY TO GET IT RIGHT. THE BIG ISSUE WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT SO THIS AS US AND WIENER SAID THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. AND IT HAS A LONG WAY TO GO AND I ALWAYS LIKE TO THINK THAT IS BILLS MOVE THROUGH EACH POLICY COMMITTEE THEY GET A LITTLE BETTER HOPEFULLY- BUT I'D LIKE A SISSY TO CONTINUE THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SUCH A HUGE HUGE. ISSUE AND AS A NEW GRANDMOTHER- THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU LEARN IN THIS JOB THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN YOU HAD YOUR OWN CHILDREN I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT INTERSEX. AND I REMEMBER YOU KNOW SHE'S THREE MONTHS OLD THINKING. WOW I WONDER IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND THINKING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE BABY AS A BABY. AND NOT AS A HE OR A SHE AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AT AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES I THINK WAS PRE TESTIFIED- A BIT YOU KNOW. WE DON'T FOCUS ON A HEALTHY BABY SOMETIMES WE TOO MUCH FOCUS ON IS THAT A BOY IS THAT A GIRL AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T LOOK EXACTLY LIKE A BOY OR GIRL. WE TO FREAK OUT- SO I THINK OF IT ONE OF THE BENEFITS- IN JOB AND IN THIS BILL. IS THAT WE GET OUT THERE THAT THE PUBLIC IS NOT USED TO TALKING ABOUT. AND I APPLAUD THE WITNESSES WHO CAME AND pSTORIES BECAUSE THAT'S EASY TO DO BUT IT MAKES US SMARTER. SAYS LEGISLATOR. SO THANK YOU WIENER I THANK ALL THE WITNESSES- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FEW MORE TWEAKS TO THE BILL AND MAYBE NARROW THE SCOPE. BUT I WILL- OF THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR. VERY GOOD. AT CENTER WIENER I THINK THAT- FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR- PASSION- IN AN AREA OF. GREAT IMPORTANCE AND I KNOW YOU FOR A- WORK WITH MY STAFF AND WITH ME AND WITH OTHERS TO TRY TO FIND. COMPROMISE IF WE CAN FROM OUR HEARING THAT WE HAD- LAST YEAR- AND I KNOW A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN PUT IN AND I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. OF I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT REMAIN FOR ME- WHAT THAT ONE OF THEM IS THE ISSUE OF DEFINITION. AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS HERE THIS ONE THIS AFTERNOON A LITTLE BIT. THAT AYE AYE OPPOSE AS YOU DO SEX ASSIGNMENT SURGERY- AND LESS THAT IT IT THERE IS A COMPLETE EXAMINATION BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS- WHERE THE SEX OF THE CHILD IS UNCLEAR SO I THINK THERE'S A PLACE WHERE WE ARE IN AGREEMENT- ABOUT SEX SIMON SURGERY WORD GETS DIFFICULT IS THAT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH- YOU KNOW THERE'S I WOULD PUT THAT THREE THREE CATEGORIES CATEGORY A IS WHERE A CHILD IS BORN WITH THAT- MALE CHROMOSOMES AND MALE ORGANS- CATEGORY B. AS A CHILD BORN WITH FEMALE CHROMOSOMES IN FEMALE ORGANS. AND CATEGORY SEE WHICH FOR ME IS THE INTERSEX CATEGORY WHERE ALL THAT IS IN QUESTION- AND AB AND SO WERE I'M HAVING DIFFICULTIES IS THAT IF YOU FIT IN CATEGORY A OR B. WHERE THINGS ARE ALIGNED EXCEPT FOR SOME PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC OR PHYSICAL TRAIT- WHY NOW GOES INTO THIS CATEGORY IT INTERSECTS- AND THEREFORE WOULD HAVE THE LIMITATIONS THAT YOU DESCRIBE IN THE BILL IN TERMS OF WHAT. COULD OCCUR. COULD YOU COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY- AND I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS NOT. A MEDICAL NECESSITY WHERE THERE'S NOT- HEALTH CONDITIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YES YES BECAUSE I AND I GUESS ON BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF COMPLETION TODAY. EVERYONE AGREES THAT IF THIS FITS CA EIGHTY UNDERLINING ADRENAL. UP PROBLEM ADRENALYN BALANCE WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT MUST BE TREATED IMMEDIATELY IT'S A MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOTHING IN THIS BILL STOPS THE TREATMENT TO CORRECT- OR ADDRESS THE ADRENAL IMBALANCE NOTHING IN THIS BILL. STOP SIGN BUT ONCE YOU ADDRESS MEDICALLY THE ADRENALINE BALANCE THE QUESTION IS. DO YOU THAT AND PROCEED TO PERFORM. THE SURGERY TO QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL LIVES- THE GENERALS- SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT- SO ON THE- IF YOU THINK OF HELL LET US STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT. A TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SOMEONE WHO IS BORN WITH X. Y. CHROMOSOMES. WHO HAS GENERAL'S ARE. ANY OF US IF ANYONE WE'RE LOOKING AT A DOCTOR PARENTS AND WE SAY THAT IS A 100% WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE A NORMAL LOOKING QUOTE UNQUOTE **** EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BABY SAYS MAIL. ON BUT THEN. THAT BABY FIVE YEARS LATER OR TEN YEARS LATER FIFTEEN YEARS LATER IDENTIFIES AS A WOMAN AND SO EVEN IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION YOU DESCRIBE WHERE THERE IS. A CRIME EXACTA X. Y. SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY IS A **** OR **** THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT YOU SAID SUCCESSFULLY ABOUT GENDER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT. CHILD IS GOING TO END UP. IDENTIFIED WITH A GENDER AND YET. A GENDER DECISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR THAT CHILD. A VISIT BY THE. WITHOUT ANY IMPORT IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX IT'S ABOUT GENDER PUTTING ASIDE EVEN THE A SENSE OF BERMAN HARM BUT CENTER SEX AND GENDER WITH ALL RESPECT SEX AND GENDER. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GENDER HOW YOU I SELF IDENTIFY AND TALKING ABOUT. YOUR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS NOW. BECAUSE YOU CAN- BUT WHATEVER YOUR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS YOU CAN IDENTIFY. AT WHATEVER YOU WANT- IDENTIFIED RIGHT SO YOU CAN HAVE. ALL MALE PARTS ALL FEMALE PARTS- YOU CAN DECIDE YOU'RE THE OPPOSITE IN TERMS OF YOUR OWN YOUR OWN GENDER SELECTION SO I'M I WANT TO SEPARATE THEM HERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SEPARATE THE MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN. THIS IS ABOUT TO SELL SOMEONE SELF IDENTIFIES THIS IS ABOUT WHAT SOMEONE IS WITH THEIR GENDER IS AND GENDER DOES NOT ALWAYS CONFORM. TO CHROMOSOMES I AGREE THAT IS OUR GUNS AND WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THERE SO THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. THAT IF YOU DECIDE THAT- YOU'RE GAY THAT DOESN'T THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ON YOUR BODILY PARTS BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF. WE AGREE THAT'S A GENDER SELECTION BUT I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL. THE PHYSICAL- CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THAT. THAT OUT IS BRN WITH IT I BUT THE ROOM WHERE THERE IS NO CONFLICT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU APPALLING OPPORTUNITIES DANCER WHERE THERE IS NO CONFLICT. BETWEEN CHROMOSOMES AND TRADE EXCEPT FOR SOME ISSUE- IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT AT A CH IS ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT- THAT THAT IS THAT I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS NOT- AYE AYE ISSUE OF YOUR OWN SELF IDENTITY. ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE THROUGH ABOUT WHAT BUT IF YOU. WITHIN A- LITERATE. AND THAT. TOO WOULD TO QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL SIZE. ON THAT WHERE IN THAT IS IT CONDUCT CREATING A CONFORMANCE WHERE IS THAT IS A CREATING AYE AYE SEX ASSIGNMENT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO. SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A BABY THAT'S BORN WITH ACCEPTS CHROMOSOMES. WITH TWO. A BABY THAT'S BORN WITH AFFECTS TONES AND A LARGE AND A LARGE **** INCIDENTS SURGERY IS PERFORMED AND SIMILAR IS NOT A MEDICAL CONDITION LET'S SAY IT COULD BE FROM CH AND A THREE ON BALANCE THE DRESS AND THEN A CLITORAL REDUCTION IS PERFORMANCE I MEAN YOU'RE REMOVING TISSUE- AND THEN LET'S SAY FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE OR TENER FOR THE- BACK. KID SAYS BUT I'M A BOY. YOU AND THAT. THE SIDES I WANT TO HAVE SURGERY TO COME FOR MY BODY TO A MY GENDER IS. BY THAT SURGERY PERFORMED AS A CHILD AS A BABY COULD MAKE IT HARDER OR EVEN PRECLUDE THE SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS INVOLUNTARY ONCE A WEEK SO BY TWO BY MAKING THAT CHOICE THE SAID WE THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US THAT. YOU CAN'T TALK YOUR BABY. THEN YOU PERFORM THE SURGERY THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THAT PERSON TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR BODY BASED ON THEIR GENDER IN THE FUTURE DOT THAT'S WHY THESE PERMANENT DECISIONS CAN BE SO CATASTROPHIC FOR PEOPLE CAUGHT IT AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXPLANATION AND ONE THAT I AGREE WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT. THAT THAT- CONCLUSION COULD BE BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS THAT ALL THOSE. CHILDREN WHO HAVE HAD THAT PROCEDURE DONE WHO WHO HAD THAT- HAD THE TISSUE CHANGED IN SOME FASHION. AND THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THAT MMHM CIRCUMSTANCE RIGHT AND SO WHILE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT. YOU COULD HAVE AND IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE. YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH THAT PROCEDURE BEING DONE. HOW DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THOSE OTHERS WHERE THAT PROCEDURE ACTUALLY. ENHANCE THEIR LIFE PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND LOTS OF WAYS RIGHT WHICH IS ALSO A POSITIVE. AND WE DO THAT. BY SAYING THAT WHEN YOU'RE SIX YEARS OLD. YOU CAN HAVE THE SURGERY AND IF YOU LOOK AT AND WHAT WE DO IN THIS LEGISLATURE. EVERY DAY. AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ALL OF US. IS THERE THERE ARE SOME PIECES THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT ARE SO CLEAR CUT. THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE YOU NOT IT'S NOT. AS YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE BALANCING EQUITIES. AND THE QUESTION IS AYE AYE WE AGREED THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SURGERY. TWO YEARS LATER ARE. REALLY HAPPY THAT THEY HAD THE SURGERY WE'RE NOT DISPUTING THAT. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ERASE THEM. THERE ARE SOME EFFORTS TO ERASE INTERSEX PEOPLE. AND MINIMIZE THEM BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO A RACE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SURGERY. BUT THE QUESTION IS IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO. HOW NEAT ONCE THE SURGERY AND CAN. THE LADY AT THE SIX DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING IT. AND THEN THEY GO ON THEIR PUT THEIR LIVES. FIRST IS THE PERSON WHO. HAS THE SURGERY IS A BABY. AND THEN WITH THE ROLE AND ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE AND IT'S TOO LATE THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE'RE THE EQUITIES LIE. THE THERE'S ONLY ONE GROUP THERE. WHO ARE WHO IF YOU CAN NOT MAKE THAT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE DECISIONS MADE FOR THEM. SO IN THE EQUITIES OR PRETTY CLEAR HERE ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. OKAY I APPRECIATE YEAR. CLARIFICATION AT SOME PLACE WE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES ON. I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT SOMEONE BEING GAY AT THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION I DIDN'T MAKE IMMEDIATE AND IMPLIES THAT NOT IT YES I GENDER I TO MISTER CHAIRMAN GIVEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT- THIS IS THE SECOND THAT. THE SECOND PLACE THAT THE THIRD PLACE TODAY MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO IS THAT. IN YOUR BILL IT PUTS LIMITATIONS ON WHAT. PROCEDURES CAN CAN- GO FORWARD- AND BUT YOU DEFEND YOU CREATIVE COMMITTEE IN THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO THAT GOT TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE BUT- BUT YOUR BILL SAYS THAT THE PROCEDURE CANNOT CARRY ANY. MEANINGFUL RISK OF HARM. THAT'S A VERY BROAD DEFINITION. OF WHERE THINGS CAN BE DONE I MEAN IT'S ALMOST NOTHING YOU CAN DO IN THAT AND WE CAN INVITE OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HERE TO. ADVISE ON THIS BUT THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING THAT ONE CAN DO. MEDICALLY THAT DOESN'T CREATE SOME. POTENTIAL FOR HARM COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT YEAH SURE A AND I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT IN SHORT IS THAT WE ARE. NOT GIVING THE MEDICAL BOARD THIS IS ALREADY TO CRAFT. THE STANDARDS. BUT WE ARE ALSO GUIDING IT BY SAYING THAT WE DON'T. IT THAT IF SOMETHING IN TERMS OF WHAT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE WE ARE ERRING ON THE SIDE OF BEING. RESTRICTIVE WHEN THERE IS NOT. AN IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ISSUE- AND ON THE IT THE ON THE ISSUE OF. A MEDICAL NECESSITY SO WE HAVE YOU EVER GONE THROUGH IN THIS BILL WE PUT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND- AS A WAY OF SAYING OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO MICROMANAGE THIS THIS IS THE BOARD THAT OVERSEES THE MEDICAL PROFESSION CLEAR ON THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY ITEM CRYSTAL CLEAR IN MEETINGS WITH THE OPPOSITION OTHERWISE. THAT WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO NEW. IDEAS ABOUT WHAT IF THE IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT APPROACH OF THE RIGHT DEFINITION. TO THE FINING MIDDLETON SAYS HE WE INVITE. IDEAS AND LANGUAGE- I'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHERE THEY'VE RAISED THEY DON'T LIKE OUR APPROACH TO THE FINING MEDICAL NECESSITY AND I SAID GREAT. CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH YOUR IDEA THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT AND THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM. BECAUSE THEY TAKEN- BASICALLY CATEGORICAL OPPOSITION SO THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW. ENGAGING WITH US ON THE DETAILS OF THE BILL IN PROPOSING TO BUYING FOR THEIR SIMPLY OPPOSE I'M NOT CRITICIZING THEM. BUT IT MAKES IT CHALLENGING MISTER CHAIRMAN WHEN. YOU HAVE THESE ISSUES AND YOU HAVE OPPOSITION WHO WERE WERE NOT ENGAGE ON THAT LEVEL THAT DOES MAKE IT MORE- MORE CHALLENGING SO WE AND WE ARE ALSO AWAITING. MEDICAL WHERE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET BUT WE WILL- ABOUT THEIR TAKE ON THIS AND WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE CHANGES SO- YOU KNOW CENTER LEYVA IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS BILL. ON WILL CONTINUE THIS IS NOT ONE WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE ANY AMENDMENTS IS BUT WE HAVE MADE AMENDMENTS BASED ON FEEDBACK. THE CRIME EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE OPPOSITION WHO WORKS WITH US. ON THOSE AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE- WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND I GUESS I CAN I CAN SAYS NOW OUR MICHAEL OR OR MY CLOTHES BECAUSE I THERE WERE SOME STATEMENTS MADE. BY THE OPPOSITION THANK ARE JUST FACTUALLY. INACCURATE SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO WAIT TO TALK ABOUT THAT OR DO IT NOW. YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO IT AS YOUR CLOTHES YEAH OKAY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO COLLEAGUES AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HEARING THE SAID I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A LONG HEARING THIS IS BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL BILL BUT IT'S- AN IMPORTANT ONE AND IT DOES IMPLICATE THE BASIC CIVIL. RIGHTS AND- HUMAN RIGHTS OF THESE- INTERSECTS INDIVIDUALS OF INTERSEX COMMUNITY DOES EXIST AND YOU'VE HEARD STATEMENTS TODAY ABOUT THAT FEW IT'S RARE. EXACTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE. THAT THE MOTHER COMMITTEES. IT IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF. YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU- WE HEARD ABOUT- NINE AS STATISTIC 95% OF CH- PATIENCE AND UP IDENTIFYING IS FEMALE. BRISTOL THAT MEANS ONE IN TWENTY DON'T. AND THEY JUST GOT THAT SURGERY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T CONFORM- THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE IS DATA INDICATING- THAT ABOUT ONE IN EIGHT DON'T IDENTIFIES FEMALE SO MORE THAN DOUBLE. THE STATISTICS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY. FOR PROXIMAL HYPOSPADIAS WHICH IS STILL PART OF THE BILL. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THOSE PATIENTS. DO NOT IDENTIFY AS MALE. AND YET THE SURGERIES. QUOTE UNQUOTE FIX THEIR **** EVEN THOUGH THEY END UP ONE IN FOUR IDENTIFY AS FEMALE. ON WE ALSO HER YOU KNOW I'M I REPRESENT A DISTRICT INCLUDES UCSF- I AM- I SAID THIS BEFORE SAID AGAIN I AM INTENSELY PROUD. OF THE UCS OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENTS ONE OF THE VERY VERY I'LL SAY IT IT IT IT'S THE BEST INSTITUTION THE WORLD WHAT'S THE THREE IT'S AND I'M AND I LOVE SORRY OKAY. I SAID I SHOULDN'T OFFEND MY COLLEAGUES ON THE RUN IN MY BILL BUT I. I'M VERY PROUD TO REPRESENT YOU SEE US OUT AND I- AND ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE INSURANCE THAT I CHOSE BECAUSE I CAN GO TO USE YES UP IF I NEED TO- SO I LOVE UCSF BUT- AT. BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE SURGERIES ARE BEING PERFORMED. ON AND WE KNOW THAT EVEN FROM YOU SEE THIS STUFF- THERE WAS IF ANYONE I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE SERVING MIDEAST HEARD THE RESOLUTION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THERE WAS A POSITION THAT YOU CASF DOCTOR BASKIN WHO CAME UP REPEATEDLY AND IT WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR THE SURGERIES WERE BEING PERFORMED HE STOPPED COMING OUT OF BECAUSE HE WAS SAYING SOME REALLY. OVER THE TOP THINGS ARE NOT HIS FROM UCSF. AND WE KNOW THAT MEDI CAL AND THIS IS THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OVER BROAD IN TERMS THE CATEGORY. BUT FIFTEEN SINCE 200-041-5000 SURGERIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND SOME OF THOSE ARE DISTAL HYPE STATUS WOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL. BUT AS OF THE LOWER NUMBER THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND. IT'S NOT ZERO AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ZERO YES IT WAS WORSE THIRTY YEARS AGO I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. IS A BALDING ON THIS AND I COMMEND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION REVOLVING ON THIS. BUT THAT EVOLUTION IS NOT COMPLETE THE SURGERIES ARE STILL HAPPENING WHEN THEY'RE NOT. MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY I ALSO- AGREE- WITH THE DOCTOR THAT THE PHYSICIANS WILL NOT WILLFULLY HARM ANYONE I THINK- I. MEAN THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF PHYSICIANS WANT TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR PATIENTS. HI THIS IS NOT ABOUT WILL FULLY HARMING- BUT THIS IS ABOUT HARM. DOES HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THESE CHOICES EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMPLETELY NOT. WHAT'S INTENDED FOR TRYING TO HELP BUT SOMETIMES THAT HELPS. CAUSES HARM AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO LEGISLATE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT STATISTICS WE HAVE IS THAT 90% OF TIPS. WITH CH ARE RECEIVING VAGINOPLASTY SIR CLITORAL CLASSES. SO THAT DOES NOT LIKE IT THAT YOU KNOW TO SAID THIS IS THIS IS JUST NOT HAPPENING IT'S NOT REAL IF IT WEREN'T HAPPENING THE QUESTION IS. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. OR WITH A WHITE AND SAID LET'S JUST PUT IT INTO LAW. BUT THE SURGERIES ARE HAPPENING A AND THAT'S WHY- THIS IS ON. SORRY THE SO COLLEAGUES- I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING TIME TO BE WITH ME. TO MEET WITH THE ADVOCATES TO REALLY DO AGAIN. DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR FOCUS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I SENATOR WINNER- YOUR PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE MAY EVEN EXCEED YOUR PASSION FOR SB FIFTY. EVEN AT THE NATION'S ADVOCATE MORE THAN IT ADVOCATE- YOU CARE GREATLY ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY- THAT YOU ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP. AND ARE DESERVING OF GREAT GREAT PRAISE FOR THAT- AND I THINK THAT- IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT WE HAVE A LOTS OF AREAS OF AGREEMENT- I DON'T SUPPORT SEX ASSIGNMENT- SURGERY- BUT I ALSO HAVE TO BE. COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THOUGHT THAT THAT THAT CHILDREN. WHO HAVE HAD PROCEDURES DONE THAT AREN'T ABOUT SEX ASSIGNMENT- THAT PARENTS AND PHYSICIANS IN THEIR BEST JUDGEMENT AT THOUGHT WERE TO THEIR BENEFIT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY ESTABLISHES- THEIR GENDER IDENTITY I THINK IN SOME CASES. IT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING- BUT I THINK THAT I MIGHT MY CONCERN WITH WITH YOUR BILL TODAY IS THAT I THINK IT GOES IN AND THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND I AND I. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WELL THEN LET'S LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND- BUT I DO THINK IT REQUIRES SOME MORE WORK AND I DO THINK IT REQUIRES SOME NARROWING- IN REGARD TO THE DEFINITION- I THINK WE CAN FIND A PATHWAY. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS NOT ONE I THINK THAT WE CAN. STOP SIX ASSIGNMENT SURGERY IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE CAN LEAD THE NATION ON THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND- IT'S WITH RELUCTANCE THAT I CAN'T FIND MYSELF UNDER THE BILL AS WRITTEN TODAY. URGING ITS PASSAGE. AS SO WITH THAT CENTER MAY MATTER OF A COUPLE COMMENTS. THANK YOU AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU SENATOR WINNER HOW WOULD IT WHAT A PLESURE IT IS TO WORK WITH YOU OF IT REALLY IS BECAUSE YOU YOU ASKED US. CONTINUOUSLY IN THIS BODY AND IT IS- YOU KNOW WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A NUMBER OF TIMES AND- YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE PAIN THAT. THAT THE SIX ASSIGNMENT. SURGERY HAS CAUSED IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY HAVE AND- YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO IS A PARENT OR NOW OF A GRANDPARENT. YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THAT THOSE ISSUES AND  JUST THINK THAT IT IT IS- SUCH A CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I WAS. IS THIS IS EVOLVED IN MY THINKING THE ISSUE OF. REALLY DO NO HARM AND I KNOW THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF FOR ME I IS I LOOKED AT THIS YOU KNOW I WAS. LOOKING AT MY A. MY SENSE OF THAT IN MY A FEELING OF I DON'T WANT TO DO HARM. BY MAKING A DECISION AND I LOOKED AT THE MEDICAL BOARD IN IN THEIR- ROLE IN THIS. IN THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND I JUST FIND. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND IN THE SIX YEAR OLD THAT ARBITRARY NUMBER AGE. I LOOK AT MY GRANDDAUGHTERS FIVE ALMOST SIX AND I'M THINKING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. SHE COULD MAKE THAT DECISION- ON INTO THE A NUMBER OF. INVOLVED IN THIS IS THE CHAIR INDICATED I'M THERE. I JUST. THERE IS JUST TOO MANY UNCERTAIN FOR ME WERE I THINK MY VOTE. COULD CAUSE HARM AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR ME BUT I HOPE YOU. IF THAT IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT BILL. I'LL BE VOTING NO UNFORTUNATELY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT A SENATOR GALGIANI- I AM PROUD TO BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I'M SOMEONE I HAVE MULTIPLES- SCOLIOSIS THAT MEANS THAT MY HAVE OCCURRED MY SPINE BECAUSE MY LEFT LEG IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN MY RIGHT LEG I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL I WAS MUCH OLDER AND CAME ACROSS IT WHEN I WAS DOING AT PHYSICAL FOR TO GET ON THE TRACK TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DON'T KNOW THE MY PARENTS EVEN KNOW THAT I HAVE IT IT DOESN'T AFFECT MY DAILY LIFE I FORGET THAT I EVEN HAVE IT UNTIL SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMES UP AND IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT IT AND I THINK- WITH ALL OF THEM PEOPLE WHO. HAVE HAD SURGERIES WHAT IT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AN INMATE IN THE FUTURE PRETTY EARLY FROM RURAL AREAS ARE AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE SPECIALISTS THAT ARE AS ADVANCED IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE WHICH AND LOCAL I RECALL KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD WHERE WOULD BE TAKE WOULD BE A. N. DOT LIFE ALTERING CHANGES AND I JUST THINK IT'S TIME TO. TO STOP AND LOOK AT MAYBE THE HARM THAT'S BEEN DONE AND HOW DO WE HOW WE PUT A PAUSE ON THAT AND I TRUST THE MEDICAL FIELD ENOUGH THAT I BELIEVE IF THERE WAS AN AGENCY THAT DIDN'T FIT WITHIN. THE CONFINES THIS BILL THAT. WOULD BE IN A BILL STILL. THIS AT THAT THAT. MY PEOPLE WITH THE INTENTIONS AT HEART SEE THAT THERE IS A NEED AND THAT SURGERY COULD OCCUR WITHOUT HAVING TO COME UNDER THE ANY PENALTIES UNDER THIS-BILL I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO GO AFTER DOCTORS AND PENALIZE BUT IT WAS INTENDED TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND JUST TAKE THINGS BACK AND SAY LET'S NOT LOOK AT LET'S NOT MUCH EMPHASIS ON WHAT'S NORMAL AND WHAT SOCIETY THIS IS NORMALLY LIKE NO ONE CAN SEE THAT I HAVE A CURVATURE IN MY SPINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME OR TO ANYBODY ELSE AND IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE CAN'T SEE UNLESS IT. KLAY NECESSARY IT SHOULDN'TMATTER AND I THINK I PUT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS AS A SOCIETY ON WHAT IS NORMAL SO. I AM I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK THAT THERE IS A PATHWAY TO GET THERE AND THAT. THE I KNOW THE AUTHOR I KNOW HS COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE I KNOW HIS COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS AND REALLY PERSEVERING TO GET THINGS RIGHT. I THINK THAT WE HAVE TIME TO STILL DO THAT THERE'S ALWAYS FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION AS WELL BUT- I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI SENATOR DOT. I YES- I'D FOR THE TIME I LIKE DISSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WAS SENATOR HILL. BUT JUST ON A ENFORCEABLE I'D I DO THANK- THE SENATOR CENTER WIENER FOR- HIS PASSION ON THIS ISSUE THIS GOES WAY BACK YOU WITHOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. YOUR CONVERSATIONS AS A GRANDFATHER TO FOR- ONE BOY IN AND THREE GRANDDAUGHTERS IN THAT SPACE BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN I COULD TOTALLY CONCUR I I'D FIND IT JUST ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE. TO BELIEVE AT THAT AGE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO- I DID THAT AGES ANY PANACEA FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TAKING SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT LIKE THIS AND MOVING IT YOUR TO AGE SIX I JUST I JUST. CAN'T SEE IT- YOU KNOW MAYBE AS TIME MOVES ON IT ALL LEARN MORE AND- YOU KNOW CHANGE ON THIS BUT FOR TODAY I'M JUST NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE HI THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. AT CENTER WIENER DO WE WANT TO LEAVE HERE THIS IS AND SO DO YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU OUT FURTHER. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A AND I A. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ALREADY HAD BACKING A PRE VOTE OF SORTS- BUT I WOULD AYE AYE CLOSED I DON'T REALIZE THAT MEMBERS WERE MAKING COMMENTS ARCHES TWO QUICK THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO. ADDRESS I DIDN'T I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER AND I WOULD NORMALLY CLOSE AT THE END DOT BEFORE ALL THE COMMENTS WERE MADE. BY I JUST TWO QUICK THINGS- BUT FIRST OF ALL. JUST TO JUST TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE SIX YEAR OLD. THIS BILL DOESN'T SAID THE SIX YEAR OLD BESIDES. THIS BILL SAYS A PARENT DECIDES IN CONSULTATION WITH THE POSITION. WHEN THE KID IS SIX WHEN THE AND YES AND WE DO WE DO THAT WE'RE NOT SEND A KID MAKES A CHOICE A PARENT MAKES A CHOICE. AT SIX WHEN THE KICK IN AT LEAST. SPEAK AND SPEAK WORDS AND COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A BIRD THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR BECAUSE I SOUNDED LIKE THE THAT- MONITOR THE CONFUSION THERE. AND TERMS OF MEDICAL NECESSITY WE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD. BUT IT TOOK TO SAYS WHAT I SAID THE BEGINNING THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE FIRST HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE- AND THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON- I'VE AYE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVITE- CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OTHERS. TO ENGAGE WITH US ON THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY- AND SO I WOULD HOPE I THINK. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IS AS CONSIDER WE'VE HAD NO BILLS WHETHER OR MAYBE SOME DEFINITIONS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AFTER THE FIRST POLICY- COMMITTEE- AND SO I. RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I WROTE. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD. SO THIS POINT ON THE RECOGNIZE THE MOTION FROM SENATOR LEYVA TO MOVE THE BILL SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GLAZER. CHIANG ARCHULETA.
