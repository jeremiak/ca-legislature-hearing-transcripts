THIS BILL LOOKS TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMS IN VARIOUS CITIES HAVE CREATED TICKET FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS TO SOLVE THIS VERY ISSUE. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WOULD ASK THAT ALL OF OUR CITIES CREATE A TICKET TICKET FORGIVENESS PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES A PATHWAY TO STABILITY. INSTEAD OF PUSHING PEOPLE DEEPER INTO CRISIS OR MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM. TO BECOME HOUSE. HELLO THIS IS HARM REDUCTION.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROLE WORD THANK YOU I WANT TO TAKE THE OFFER FOR BRING THIS FOR AS WELL I KNOW SOMEBODY THAT HAS I'M LIKE ME WORK REALLY REALLY CLOSELY TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT MANY ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT IS FAIR- TRY TO USE- ARE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IS LEGISLATORS TO REALLY LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD CLEAR THE DECK OUT- FOR A LOT OF THOSE- PASTIME FRACTIONS THAT ARE OTHERWISE- DRAGGING DOWN THERE- THEIR THEIR PATHWAYS FOR SUCCESS SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL TO THAT AND- THAT SAID I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY GLIDER ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AND ANALYSES AGAIN ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WHICH I SAID ON THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES LOS ANGELES BEING ONE OF THEM IF YOU I'M WRONG I'M BECAUSE I DEALT WITH THIS IN SAN DIEGO THAT WORK ON VEHICLE HABITATION QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO APPLAUD THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL FOR TRYING TO SET UP ONE BOTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR C. PARKING BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE MAP OF THE CITY TO UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE ARE- GOING TO EXEMPTS- TAKE- AT ALL BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE. INDIVIDUALS WHO- I'M FORCING ME TO HAVE A HOUSE THE MOMENT THAT ARE. PLEASE AND SO I WONDER IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF- OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ENCOURAGE CITIES TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT MODEL AS WELL- IF THERE IS. SOME SORT OF A- A GIVE AND TAKE HERE. THAT WE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO CLEAR THE DECK AND HELP INDIVIDUALS OUT REALLY- RESOLVE ANY OF THOSE- FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ISSUES THAT- THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY FACING WITH OF THE MOMENT- BUT ALSO LOOK AT THIS IS THE- CARE AND STICK OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ENCOURAGE CITIES. TO CREATE THOSE SAFE PARKING- LOCATIONS TO CREATE- AREAS WITHIN THE CITY WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TAKEN ENFORCEMENT AT THAT AT ALL- I THINK THIS IS THAT THE KIND. OF IDEA THAT CAN REALLY SPUR THAT THE CONVERSATION- IN SAN DIEGO- WE DID NOT GO AS FAR AS WE SHOULD HAVE THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE OUR VEHICLE HABITATION ORDINANCE- BECAUSE IT REALLY DIDN'T. OFFER THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF DESIGNATED. PARKING AREAS. WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE- I. WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING A TAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE STILL ADDING A BURDEN WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO GET THIS CLEARED OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND- ALSO. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS REALLY TRYING TO EASE THOSE BURDENS. AND REALLY HELP PEOPLE BACK ON TO A SUCCESSFUL PATHWAY IT FASTER- SO MY WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT THAT GOING FOR NOT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. AS YOU FOR THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING A FOREIGN. YES MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU WERE. I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER THIS BILL I THINK IT MAKES GREAT SENSE IT HAS. SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES CONTAINED.

CHECK ONE TWO ALL RIGHT FOR THE EXPEDIENCY I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN A BILL THAT WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF DATA IN THE PORT DRAYAGE INDUSTRY AMID COVERED NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN SUPPLY CHAIN DELAYS HIGHLIGHT THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN EFFICIENT GOODS MOVEMENT AT OUR NATION'S PORTS. AND WHILE COVE IT WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SHUTDOWNS AROUND THE WORLD WIDESPREAD MISS CLASSIFICATION OF TRUCK DRIVERS CONTRIBUTED TO A SHORTAGE OF DRIVERS AND LESS EFFICIENT PORT OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS THE PORTS ARE OUR GATEWAY TO THE WORLD IN A CRITICAL AND CRITICAL TO THE FLOW OF GOODS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WILL INVEST BILLIONS IN MODERNIZING PORTS IN HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND DATA COLLECTION TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND IDENTIFY BOTTLENECKS. MEMBERS THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES HAS RANKED AS THE NUMBER ONE CONTAINER PORT IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE TWO THOUSAND. THIS IS RIGHT IN MY OWN BACKYARD THIS TRANSLATES TO MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRUCKS MOVING FROM THE PORT OF LA AND ALSO THE PART OF LONG BEACH THE PORT OF OAKLAND. BUT THE PACIFIC LEE TO L. A. COUNTY TO THE INLAND EMPIRE WAREHOUSES AND ALONG THE WAY PAST MY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES. THE TO THE FIVE THE TEN THE ONE A ONE THE ONE TEN THE ONE THIRTY FOUR AND THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAYS. LABRANG COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR DECADES TO RAISE STANDARDS AT THE PORTS FROM REDUCING EMISSIONS TO CRACKING DOWN. ON MISS CLASSIFICATION. I AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY TO COLLECT AND CONSOLIDATE SPECIFIED DATA RELATED TO THE GOODS MOVEMENT IN TRANSPORTATION SUPPLY CHAIN. AND WILL REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO MAKE THIS DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE. THIS WORK HAS BEEN. IN A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP OF LABOR. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES UNITED TO PUSH FOR CLEAN AND SAFE PORTS. THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS EFFORTS TO HELP ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS HOWEVER THE WORK IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE DATA ON THE PORT DRAYAGE INDUSTRY IS SPREAD ACROSS. MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND ON MULTIPLE DATABASES. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO FILL IN SOME OF THOSE GAPS AND CREATE A MUCH NEEDED STANDARD DATA COLLECTION THAT BE THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN ONE PLACE. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION OVER THE CONCERNS. AND THEY HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO FIND A REASONABLE PATH FORWARD TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE IS RUN IT UP PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR. AND SECRETARY TREASURER OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL THREE NINE EIGHT AND SAM APPEL WITH THE BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA BE PASSED THE GAVEL TO MR FONG BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO PERCENT OF BILL. THANK I WILL START WITH RON AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SAM THAT'S OKAY. OPERATOR PLEASE PROCEED MMHM. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HONORARY PRESIDENT IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR AND SECRETARY CHENEY OF CHANGES UP OF THE NINETY SIX HOW THE SPONSOR AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS MY UNION AND FIGHTING TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS AT THE COURTS FAR TOO MANY OF THESE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED AND FORCED TO BUSINESS WITHOUT HAVING ANY CONTROL OF THEIR OWN RATES ARE WORKING CONDITIONS USA TODAY COMPARED. IT TO INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. THE CONDITIONS A DIRECT IMPACT ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE PORTS WHEN DRIVERS HAVE TO BEAR THE CONSTANT CLEAN TRUCK UPGRADES. THERE IS A LOWER COMPLIANCE RATE AND- AND POLLUTING TRUCKS CONTINUE TO CAUSE ASTHMA CANCER AND OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR FAMILIES LIVING NEXT TO THE PORTS. WE'VE HEARD A LOT LATELY ABOUT SUPPLY CHAIN DELAYS CONDITIONS AT THE COURTS DON'T JUST IMPACT DRIVERS AND COMMUNITIES. THEY IMPACT OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY WE NEED BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHO'S GOING IN AND OUT OF OUR PORTS AND HOW TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT SAFER. AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN IS AN AIRLINE FOCUS REMEDY IT CALLS ON COURTS TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ASKED THE- TRANSPORTATION AGENCY TO COMPILE DATA. FROM SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES TO CREATE ONE CENTURY LANDING PLACE THIS WILL ALLOW POLICYMAKERS AND ADVOCATES TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTIONS FOR SAFER AND CLEANER PORTS. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE PORT SHOULD MATTER TO ALL OF US FROM IMMIGRANT DRIVERS LEASING BE GREAT YOU NAY CANNOT AFFORD TO. SINGLE MOTHERS TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN FROM EMISSIONS. AND POOR COMMUNITIES OUR COMMUNITY. EDITOR DESERVE BETTER KANEMI REALIZE ON A POOR INTO. IS ESSENTIAL TO GOOD. DECISION MAY WE ARE PROUD TO A B. TWO FIFTY SEVEN AND WE COMMAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR BEING A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU. SAM YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS FAMILY HELLO CALIFORNIA THE MANAGER FOR BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE WHICH IS AN ALLIANCE THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTING INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE WITH PERHAPS THE MOST EXPLOITATIVE WORKING CONDITIONS AS TO ADD DETAIL BY- REASON THAT THE CRITICAL SECTOR OF FOCUS FOR THE LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT IN OUR STATE. LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED THE NUMBER OF BILLS TO CLEAN UP THE SECTOR AND REDUCE THE INSIDIOUS PRACTICE SUBMIT CLASSIFICATION. DESPERATE THAT INCLUDED EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR EIGHTY FIVE SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT AND TODAY WE TURNED AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN. DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAKE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS INCREDIBLY CRISP IT DIDN'T BUSINESS STRATEGY AND TRUCKING THAT NOT ONLY EXPLOITS TRUCK DRIVERS BUT ALSO PUT HUGE BARRIERS IN THE WAY TO GO TO GETTING CLEANER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. THE LEGISLATURE IS ATTACKED THIS PROBLEM FROM ALL ANGLES BUT OUR TRUCK DRIVERS AND DJ COMMUNITIES NEED MORE LEGISLATIVE ACTION HERE. BECAUSE COMPANIES OFFLOAD COSTS OF OPERATIONS ON TO DRIVERS MISCLASSIFIED CONTRACTORS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR STATEMENT EMISSIONS. RULES THAN OTHER FLEET. OUR DATA BEARS THIS OUT AND- AHEAD THEIR OWN MISSION TRY IS THE TO BE SO MUCH FOR. WITH MATH CLASS TO IN THE WAY AT EVERY. AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN IST SO CRITICAL BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA WE NEED ADVOCATES AND THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS. DATA CENTER DISTRIBUTED ACROSS AGENCIES AND WE CAN'T SEE HOW THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE OPERATE. EVEN CARBS STAFF HAVEN'T EEN ABLE TO ASSEMBLE A FULL PICTURE OF THIS DATA AND ONGOING TRUCKING RULE MAKING THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING. GOVERNING GOVERNING PROCESS THESE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION TRANSPARENCY AND ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE LAWS THAT THAT LEGISLATORS PASSED. I PERSONALLY PUBLISHED REPORTS ON THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING INDUSTRY GROUND PUBLIC RECORD REQUESTS AND NO THE X. I KNOW THAT AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WILL ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTIONS SO CRITICAL DATA HOLES AND INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ONGOING RULEMAKINGS AND PREVIOUSLY ENACTED LAWS. PLEASE CONTINUE THE LEGISLATURE LEGACY OF CLIMATE ACTION THAT SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S MOST EXPLOITED WORKERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE TO AND- TO OPPOSITION. I THINK WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AND HARBOR TRUCKING ASSOCIATION SO ODD. IN PERSON A MEASURE MOTA AND WE HAVE ON THE PHONE MATT A STRAP FROM THE HARBOR TRUCKING SO WE'LL START WITH CHRIS AND WE'LL GO TO MACRI'S THE RECEIPT. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIR FONG AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CHRISTMAS WITH CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. A CTA MUST UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN AT THIS TIME. AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE CAL STUDY CONTINUOUSLY GATHER AND PUBLISH INFORMATION FROM LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AT LEAST TEN PORT AUTHORITIES. ANNELIES FIVE STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING CARB OSHA ET DE D. LSE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. I ENCOMPASSING EIGHT REGULATORY DATABASES AT LEAST FIVE GRAND LOAN PROGRAMS IN THE CREATION OF A NEW DATA GATHERING REPORTING OBLIGATION FOR THE TEN SEAPORTS. WELL THE STATED GOAL OF AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN IS TO INFORM SMARTER POLICY AND IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. THE RULES CITED IN THIS BILL ALREADY EXTENSIVELY ENFORCED FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING VEHICLE CODE REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CARBS DRAYAGE TRUCK RULE IN INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. AS A CONDITION OF DMV REGISTRATION. WAGE AND HOUR LAWS ARE ENFORCED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S BUREAU FIELD ENFORCEMENT. CLAIMANTS CAN ADDITIONALLY BRING WAGE CLAIMS THE LABOR COMMISSION FIELD OFFICES PORT TRUCKING COMPANIES WHO HAVE UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS ARE PUBLISHED ON THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S WEBSITE. AND CUSTOMERS OF THESE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO JOINT LIABILITY FOR PROSPECTIVE WAGE CLAIMS. FINALLY AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN PROPOSES TO SHIFT THE COSTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF GATHERING INFORMATION THAT THE SPONSORS COULD OTHERWISE ARE ALREADY OBTAINED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE COST OF THE STATE TOGETHER AND WILL LIKELY BE HIGH IN WILL TAKE FUNDS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GRANTS. FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHAT BENEFIT WILL AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN CRATE THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR. BY EXISTING LAW REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT. FINALLY. WE LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR REACHING HOW TO DISK THIS BILL IN OF THIS HERE. C. TO A- THE CONTINUED WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH LABOR IN THE AUTHOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THIS BILL FURTHER AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A MISTER CHAPMAN ARE YOU ON THE PHONE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SHARE FARMING COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON ON AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN. BUT IT IS NOT SHOT BY IN THE CEO OF THE HARBOR TRUCKING ASSOCIATION WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST HARBOR DURING SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND ARE BASED HERE IN THE GREAT CITY CALIFORNIA. SALINAS ARE CALLED OF THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION EXPRESSED HER DISPLEASURE TIME AGO WE MUST ALSO. AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN. WE CAN APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR ROBUST DATA SHARING MEASURES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ISN'T CLEAR HOW THIS MAGIC MEASURE FURTHER ENHANCED SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY. IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE BILL IS NOT A FOCUS ON EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AND ENHANCEMENTS. IT REALLY CREATES ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FROM ATTENDING CALIFORNIA PORTS. AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. LARGE EUROPEAN WE COLLECT INTO DATA FROM. DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DISCOVERABLE THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. HE'S REQUIREMENTS TO COME AT A TIME WHEN AGENCY IMPORT RESOURCES ARE GREATLY NEEDED TO TACKLE AND IMPLEMENT ACTIONABLE MATTERS MEASURES TO ENHANCE MOBILITY SAFETY AND THE LOST CITY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S SUPPLY CHAIN. FURTHERMORE AS YOU FORGIVE CTA RULES CITED IN AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN ARE ALREADY EXTENSIVELY ENFORCED. SO IT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT BENEFITING AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE THAT IS NOT ALREADY IN CURRENT LAW AND HAS READILY AVAILABLE DATA. IS FOR THESE REASONS WHY WE MUST OPPOSE AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN HOWEVER WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. I THINK IT WAS DROPPED- WE WILL NOW GO TO YOU IN PERSON TESTS HAVE BEEN IN PERSON- IN ANY OF ANY INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO COME FORWARD AND- EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT PLEASE DO SO NOW.

THIS IS NAOMI STEINFELD A MEMBER OF CLERGY AND LAITY UNITED FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE I'M CALLING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY SEVEN. AT THIS TIME SHOPPERS WE HAVE NOBODY ELSE IN Q. I THINK I THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY MEMBERS. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS QUESTION- TO THE OPPOSITION I MAYBE I'LL JUST REFER REFERENCE OR SPEAK TO OF ASSET TO- THE COUPLE TICKETS ADDITION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN- CAN YOU DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER IN TERMS OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL ON HOW- AFFECTS THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES RIGHT NOW. AND HOW WE HAD HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT IN A DAILY BASIS- CERTAINLY THANK YOU TEAR FONG- SO IT YEAH WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA GATHERING EFFORTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE HARBOR TRUCKING ASSOCIATION REFERRED TO- THERE BEEN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS FOR MANY YEARS NOW. ABOUT TRYING TO GET DIFFERENT- PRIVATE SECTOR PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN MEANING TRUCKERS OCEAN CARRIERS THE PARTS THEMSELVES. TO SHARE BETTER OPERATIONAL INFORMATION- IF YOU CAN KNOW WHEN- A PARTICULAR CONTAINERS GOING TO ARRIVE IN THE PORT ON A PARTICULAR DAY. IT WILL. INCREASE EVERYBODY'S ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THAT. PARTICULAR YOU KNOW THAT THEY NEEDED LABOR WORK WHAT MAY NEED TO BE. A BETTER THE WHITE HOUSE IS SUPPORTING A DATA SHARING INITIATIVE WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN SO THIS IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION. I THINK OUR CONCERN HERE IS REALLY- THE COST OF COLLATING. THESE VARIOUS DATA POINTS THAT ALREADY IN EXISTENCE FROM THESE DIFFERENT REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND GRANT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS INTO ONE PLACE WOULD COME AT A SIGNIFICANT COST THAT AT YOU KNOW AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME. WE'RE LOOKING AT A TRANSITION AS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WERE LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET TRUCKERS INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN WE WOULD RATHER HAVE RESOURCES GO TOWARDS THOSE EFFORTS- YOU KNOW IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. RATHER THAN JUST SPENDING MONEY FOR THE SAKE OF DOING IT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT- ALLOWS FOR THESE THESE DOCUMENTS TO BE DISCOVERED BY THE SPONSORS. AND MIKE A QUICK FOLLOW UP AND- I EITHER MR TRUMP OR MISHMAR YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT OF THAT THE AMOUNT OF TRUCKERS THAT ARE- GOING INTO THE PORTS HOW MANY ARE. ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE SO NATIONALLY- THE PROPORTION OF INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS TO COMPANY DRIVERS IS ROUGHLY 90% COMPANY DRIVERS TO TEN PERCENT- OWNER OPERATORS AND I'VE HEARD STATISTICS AT THE PORT THAT ARE ROUGHLY THIRTY PERCENT. INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS THE 70% A COMPANY DRIVERS. A MISTER SHOP DID YOU WANT TO- PROVIDE ANYMORE CONTEXT. I KNOW HE'S ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GERMAN FONG I AM ACTUALLY AND YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN ECHOING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT CHRISTENDOM HERE TO HEAR WHAT WERE WE ARE IN. A UNIQUE POSITION- WITH A DIVERSE WORKFORCE BOTH LEADERS SUPPORTED BY COMPANY EMPLOYEES DRIVERS TEAMSTER DRIVERS AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE. AREN'T PROPOSED. RATHER THAN AROUND HORIZON HERE FROM THE SOME OF THE STANDARDS IT REALLY IS- I NEED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE AS MANY RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST ALL COMPANIES. IN COMPLYING WITH THE RULES SO- WHILE THE PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES VERSUS OUR OPERATORS CAN FLUCTUATE IT IS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH POINT TOP WITH WHAT MR STRUGGLING TO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS- WITHOUT THE CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE DATA IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED AND AS THE OPPOSITION STATED. IT'S COLLECTED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PLACES IN AN EFFORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ONE PORTAL TO A BIT BE ABLE TO GET. DATA TO BE ABLE TO INFORMED OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE POLICY THAT HELPS WORKERS THAT HELPS THE PORTS THAT HELPS OUR ECONOMY THAT HELPS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS ALL OF THIS IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE YES BUT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO FIND. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FIND THIS INFORMATION QUICKLY WHICH WAS ALSO ARTICULATED BY THE OPPOSITION. SO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DEBATING HERE BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE TRANSPORTATION DEALS WITH POLICY. ANYTHING RELATED TO FISCAL IMPACT CAN BE DEBATED IN APPROPRIATIONS WHICH WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP AND SO I RECEBER SPEC FULLY I REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE AYE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T DEPEND ON THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS THEY SHOULD ALL BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. AND MAKE GOOD POLICY AND SO THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR THE QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR OF IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT TO. IT IS AN ODD. DISCUSSION FOR THE REASONS YOU STATED- ON THE OTHER HAND- AS ANYONE APPROACHED THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT I MEAN IT'S NOT A HUGE TECHNOLOGICAL FEAT ISN'T TO CONSOLIDATE THE DATA AND HAVE. A SINGLE FORMAT AND HAS ANYONE APPROACHED THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT DOING SO THAT A BILL WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. IT CERTAINLY UP A PROCESS THAT WE CAN TRY TO DO THE- POLICY APPROACH IS THAT SO IT'S IN STATUTE AND NO MATTER WHO IS IN CHARGE OR WHO IS GOVERNOR WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION MAY GO. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE IT IN ONE PLACE AND GET ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO ONLINE AND HAVE IT IN ONE SOLID LOCATION. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLORING I APPRECIATE THAT. WELL WHEN MR FONG IS GOVERNOR I'M SURE HE'LL BE A COOPERATIVE YOU KNOW IT IT. I. YOU JUST PAY MY HAIR GOES GRAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS A BILL BEFORE US- CERTAINLY AROUND VEHICLE- WHETHER ITS VEHICLE MANSLAUGHTER HOMICIDE DRUNK DRIVING IT CERTAINLY GETS MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT PEOPLE AND NO MY NARRATIVE OF OUR THREE YEAR OLD SON WHO WAS KILLED BY HIT AND RUN MOTORIST AND- WHEN I WAS ON A CARSON CITY COUNCIL THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AN ISSUE IN THE CITY IN TERMS OF DRAG RACING AND WE PUT SOME TOUGH ORDINANCES IN PLACE. I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO ENOUGH IN THIS SPACE IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD LIVES AND I AS ONE OF THE YOUNG THE SPEAKERS ARE SPEAKING IT REMINDED ME AND- OF A SITUATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN ONE OF MY CITIES COUPLE WEEKS MONTHS AGO RATHER WHERE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WAS OUT WHEN HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN. ARM AND VIEWING A STREET RACE- AND THEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT- SOMEONE ALWAYS BRINGS A GUN. AND SO THIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WAS KILLED- IN MY DISTRICT AS A RESULT OF BEING. PULLED INTO THE STREET RACING VIEWING AND SEEN- AND IT'S ALWAYS EVIDENCE OF THAT SOMEONE ALWAYS BRINGS A GUN. AND SO IT BREEDS THIS KINDS OF SITUATIONS UNFORTUNATELY- BUT WE HAVE TO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE- SO THAT WE STRENGTHENED THE LAW AND ALSO SAVE LIVES AT THE SAME TIME AND SO. I MEAN THROUGH THE ASPIC LEAVE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL- ON THE FLOOR OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS BEFORE THIS BODY. I THINK IT WAS GIPSON AND I JUST WANNA SAY AS- AS A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ALLEN I THINK IT'S A MEMBER GALA. AS A MEMBER GABRIEL FOR THIS MEASURE IRATE THIS SATURDAY WENT ON A RIDE ALONG WITH THE CATHOLIC HIGH PATROL IN THE BASE OF POLICE DEPARTMENT- AS THEY WERE ENGAGING IN ENHANCE- SHE RACING SIDE SHOW ENFORCEMENT THIS WEEKEND- AND I SAW FIRST HAND- THE SIZE SHOWS THAT WERE FORMING. A IN PARKING LOTS IN MY COMMUNITY IN BAKERSFIELD- THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO- OTHER SHE RACES. HOUSE CITATIONS WERE- THAT WERE MADE BUT A NUMBER OF- DO YOU EYES WERE CAUGHT- IN THIS- AND IS IT- AND FORSMAN ACTION SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO KEEP OUR ROADS SAFE AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP I WILL OFFER YOU THE OPTION TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CO AUTHORSHIP- AND FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS WANT TO THANK. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL I KNOW HOW PERSONAL THESE ISSUES ARE TOO I KNOW WHAT A LEADER YOU HAVE BEEN ON THEM- AND I THINK YOU SPOKE REALLY TO THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. WHICH IS TO SAVE LIVES AND WE KNOW THAT THESE INCIDENTS. ARE OCCURRING IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE- THOSE COMMUNITIES MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT THESE INCIDENTS USUALLY ON THE SAME WAY. WE HAVE HAD THE SAME THING A NUMBER OF TRAGIC INCIDENTS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MY COMMUNITY THAT HAVE ENDED IN THE DEATH OF YOUNG PEOPLE. RIGHT SOMETIMES ARE IN THE CAR SOMETIMES ARE NOT IN THE CAR SOMETIMES THEY DIE DURING THE SPEECH CONTEST IN QUESTION SOMETIMES THEY DIE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO. LEAVE THE PROMISE US- BUT THE PART OF THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO SAVE LIVES AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE. VICTIMS GROUP SUPPORTING IT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE TRIPLE A SUPPORTING IT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEHIND IT- BUT IF I MIGHT MISTER TRY JUST TO WANT TO RESPOND. TO THE TO THE MILDOPPOSITION FROM THE ACLU- WHO I WHO I OFTEN SEE EYE TO EYE WITH. YOU KNOW THEIR ARGUMENT AS YOU HEARD BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO- THIS IS NOT AS DANGEROUS IN A PARKING LOT AS IT IS ON A FREEWAY- AND I GUESS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SAY TO THAT- THERE'S NO DATA. THERE'S NO RESEARCH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY SITE FOR THAT PROPOSITION. I THINK COMMON TYPE SENSE TELLS ME THE OPPOSITE. THERE ARE PEDESTRIANS ON FREEWAYS- BUT THEY'RE OFTEN PEDESTRIANS AND PARKING LOTS THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE GO TO SKATEBOARD. THIS WORKABLE GO TO TEACH THEIR KIDS TO RIDE A BIKE SO. IN MY MIND THE DANGER IS ACTUALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN INNOCENT LIFE YOU LOST. IS ACTUALLY INCREASED IN A FEW MONTHS SO. AS THEY TALKED ABOUT IT- YOU KNOW THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE POLICY MORE BROADLY. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WOULD ALIGN THE LAW- I THINK CLARITY CONSISTENCY IN THE LAW IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING IT'S ON BEHALF OF THOSE. WHO HAVE BEEN- YOU KNOW VICTIMS AND WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN SPEECH CONTESTS THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON THIS BILL. I THANK YOU VERY. WE HAVE A MOTION SECOND.

I WILL ASK I WILL ADD A FEW MORE ACOSTA THIS BUT I DO APPRECIATE- THE DILIGENCE BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING A PROGRAM PROVIDING FREE TRANSIT PASSES TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND- AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. TODAY AS I PRESENT AB NINETEEN NINETEEN THE BILL THAT SEEKS TO HAVE TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS OUR STATE PROVIDE FARE FREE TRANSIT PASSES TO USE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR YOUNGER THIS BILL WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST NATION TO COMPREHENSIVELY PROVIDE ACCESS TO TRANSIT TO ITS USE. AND IT WOULD BE IT WOULD DO SO AT THIS HISTORIC MOMENT IN TIME WHEN TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS PROVING INTEGRAL TO RESPONDING TO THE FARE BOX REVENUE LOSSES OF THE PANDEMIC ONGOING CLIMB INVOLVED VOLATILITY AND RISING SOCIAL INJUSTICE. MEMBERS I AM CERTAINLY A CERTAIN MANY OF YOU WILL RECALL YOUR YOUTH A WIN AS A STRUGGLING STUDENT OR YOUNG PERSON YOU HAD TO FRUGALLY SCRAPE TOGETHER THE FUNDS TO AFFORD GAS FOR YOUR CAR OR FARES FOR BUS.

SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND UNTAMED THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD CREATE THE USE TRANSIT PASS PILOT PROGRAM STATEWIDE IN WOULD BE A FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES SO THAT THEY MAY PROVIDE. FARE FREE BUS AND RAIL SERVICES TO ALL USE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER. THIS INCLUSION OF ALL YOU TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER WILL IT CAPS A LATE THE LOWEST INCOME EARNING PORTION OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION PROVIDE THEM WITH GENUINE INCENTIVES. TO USE TRANSIT AND CONTINUE TO USE IT BEYOND THE PROGRAM THEREBY INCREASING RIDERSHIP IN RIDERSHIP HABITS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. ADDITIONALLY AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD REIMBURSE TRANSIT AGENCIES FOR THEIR COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM SO AS TO MAKE THESE. PANDEMIC AFFECTED AFFLICTED AND STRUGGLING TRANSIT PROVIDERS HOLE AGAIN. RATHER THAN HAVING TO FRONT THE COSTS OF PROVIDING TRANSIT EQUITY FOR OUR YOUTH TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR MISSION TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS.

AND MICHAEL- IT PIMENTEL IF MICHAEL'S HERE HE CAN TESTIFY IN PERSON AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE WITNESS ON THE PHONE. THE BE SURE YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND MY BUTTON. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL PIMENTEL EXACTED RECTOR THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY EIGHTY FIVE TRAINS AND RELIGION SEE MEMBERS TO VOICE OUR- REGRETTABLE OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN NINETEEN AS AMENDED ON MARCH SEVENTH. I AS I BEGIN MY REMARKS I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT AS AN ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE ELECTIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF THERAPY PROGRAMS BY CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCIES. LIKE THE AUTHOR REVIEW THESE PROGRAMS AS A KEY MECHANISM FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TRANSIT SERVICE WELCOMING WRITERS BACK TO OUR SYSTEMS IN BUILDING LIFELONG TRANSIT RIDERS IN FACT WE ARE CO SPONSORING SB NINE FORTY TWO THIS YEAR TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO USE OUR FORMULA. OF THE TOP FUNDS TO SUSTAIN FARE FREE PROGRAMS BEYOND THE PILOT PHASE. WE ALSO WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR TO SECURE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TO REMOVE A LONG STANDING STATUTORY BARRIER. TO THE STAFF WHICH MEANT OF THESE PROGRAMS. NOW AS AN INDUSTRY WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN DELIVERING FOR FREE PROGRAMS ALBEIT. WITH DISTINCT LOCALLY DICTATED PARAMETERS GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING EXTERNAL FUNDING SUCH PROGRAMS REQUIRE. SEVERAL OF OUR LARGEST AGENCIES IN LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE AND SACRAMENTO. ALL OVERSEE FOR FREE PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS AGE EIGHTEEN AND UNDER. IN OUR OPPOSITION AB NINETEEN NINETEEN IS PREDICATED% ON THREE MAIN FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE MUST BE SCRUTINIZED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE BROADER LEGISLATURE. ONE THE BILL REQUIRES TRANSIT AGENCIES TO ESTABLISH FAIR FREE PROGRAMS ARE LOSE ACCESS TO STATE TRANSIT FUNDS. TOTALING APPROXIMATELY THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO THE BILL LACKS FUNDING OFFSET FARE REVENUES THOUGH IT DOES ALLUDE TO POTENTIAL FOR SUCH FUNDING AND CURRENTLY FILLS TO CONTEMPLATE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO ADDRESS WHAT WILL BE INDUCED DEMAND FOR TRANSIT SERVICES AS WELL AS OP STORE COST. FINALLY THE BILL'S PROPOSED STRUCTURE FOR REIMBURSING TRANSIT AGENCIES WHICH CURRENTLY IS NOT IN PRINT. WOULD RELY ON EXHAUSTIVE DOCUMENTATION OF TRIPS PROVIDED INDIVIDUALS AGE TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER AND WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE OF THOUSANDS OF TRANSIT VEHICLES. IN THE ESTABLISH OF NEW OPERATIONS PROTOCOLS. AND SO WERE UNABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TODAY WE DO KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS PREPARING NEW AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THE WORK IS DOING TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUBLIC SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND LET'S MOVE TO THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. OP IF YOU COULD PLEASE FIND ALEX CLIFFORD. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ELIGIBLE FOR THE CEO OF THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL TRANSIT DISTRICT AND VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR COORDINATED TRANSPORTATION NOTICE CAL ACT IN A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF KELEX TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN NINETEEN. WELL IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AMENDMENTS ARE BEING DRAFTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL IMPRESSED. CAL ACT IS A STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBERS COMPRISED MAINLY OF SMALL URBAN RURAL TRANSIT AND PARATRANSIT OPERATORS WHAT WE DO NOT OPPOSE CREATING TRANSIT PASS PROGRAMS BUT IT ALL HINGES ON SUFFICIENT AND STABLE FUNDING AND LOCAL CONTROL. TRANSIT OPERATORS ACROSS THE STREET STATE HAVE TAKEN PROACTIVE MEASURES TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE TRANSIT PASSES AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD UNDERMINE THESE AGREEMENTS. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A MANDATE TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSIT ANYONE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND UNDER IN ORDER TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR EXISTING STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT SUFFICIENT STATE FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO COVER THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING ADMINISTERING AND BACKFILLING THE LOSS FARE REVENUE NOT TO MENTION THE FISCAL DEMANDS PLACED ON CALTRANS TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES THIS BILL WILL IMPOSE ON SMALL TO MID SIZE TRANSIT AGENCIES.

MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO OTHER COMMENTS YOU MAKE AND YOU MAY I GO AHEAD THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO COMMITTEEI WANTED TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE'S ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. YES OKAY THANK YOU SO LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE THIS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MANY BODY SEEMS TO ME AND MAYBE YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS MR HOLDEN BUT TO. THE TIME FRAME IS A LITTLE BIT TO. AMBITIOUS IN TERMS OF. DETERMINING HOW SUCCESSFUL. PROGRAM WILL BE. SO EITHER SOME REPORTS MIDSTREAM. OR A SHORTER PERIOD MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT'S WORTHWHILE. NOT NECESSARILY A SUNSET THOSE TRICKS SUNSET BUT JUST MORE. INFORMATION SURE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IS A VALID POINT I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND EVEN THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES WHETHER THERE AND UNIVERSITIES IN TEXAS OR OF WHERE THE PROGRAM SERVES BEEN TESTED AFTER THE PANDEMIC WHERE THEY SEE RIDERSHIP UP. OF THAT. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE AUTOMOBILE WHICH THOSE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT GOALS SO I THINK THAT WE CAN LOOK AT EVEN FROM THIS REPORT ON THE DOLI THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO CREATE A NEW GENERATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS- CLEAN AIR OUT OF THE AUTOMOBILES AND CREATING SOMETHING EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE FOR THEM TO MOVE AROUND BUT BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE SUGGESTS I THINK. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT PROBABLY ONE BILL THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE SOME KIND OF CHECK AND SEE HOW WELL IT'S WORKING INUNDATED MEET ITS INTENDED GOAL SO I. RECEIVE YOUR COMMENTS I FEEL IT'S A VERY VERY WORTHWHILE BILL JUST TO. AND WANTED YOU TO HEAR THAT COMMENT IN TERMS OF- GATHERING DATA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD THANK MANAGER I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S BEEN A MOTION HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL OR OTHERWISE SECOND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- OBVIOUSLY THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE FOR YOUTH- AND OUR YOUNG ADULTS TO. BE ABLE TO GET AROUND US JUST ONE LESS- BURDEN ON ON A VERY- EXPENSIVE- WAY OF LIFE THAT WE HAVE MANY OF OUR CITIES AND THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS OPERATE VERY WELL- AND AS A CONCEPT AS SOMETHING MOVE PUSHING FOR LOCALLY- I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION'S THE FUNDAMENTAL THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE TALK ABOUT. LOST REVENUE AND THAT IS- IF- YOU FIRST OF ALL I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THE PROVISION OF THIS WILL PROBABLY WORK REALLY CLOSELY AND APPROPRIATIONS AND OTHER SPACES- TO REALLY TRY TO FIND THE- STATE- C. OBLIGATION- THAT THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO. SUPPORT ALL THIS OF COURSE ALL THAT WILL FLOW THROUGH TO OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES. TO TRY TO MAKE- YOU HOLE FOR THAT BUT IF THIS INDUCES ADDITIONAL RIDERSHIP. WRITERS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ON THAT. SYSTEM AN OTHERWISE NOT PAYING A FARE. BUT WE HAVE EMPTY SEATS THAT ARE DRIVING AROUND THE DISTRICT HOW IS IT FROM I GUESS A MARGINAL. COST PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT YOU WOULD WE COUNT THAT AS REDUCED REVENUE. SO LITTLE REDUCED REVENUES REVENUE THAT'S LOSS OF THE FIREBOX. AND SO IN THE STATE WE COLLECT ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN REVENUES FROM THE FAREBOX NOW STIPULATE THAT THAT DOES SPEAK TO THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE. AT THE SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC THAT'S EXPECTED WITHIN THIS BILL. INTO AGENCIES WOULD IN THE NEAR TERM BECAUSE THE BILL'S PROVISION THAT STRUCTURE IS THAT AGENCIES AFTER FOREGO. REVENUES AS A MEANS OF SUPPORTING THEIR SYSTEMS. LOSE OUT DIRECTLY ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE AREA WHERE WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED AND THAT SPOKEN TO WITHIN OUR LETTER. IS THAT CONCEPT OF INDUCED DEMAND. NOW GRANTED ARE AT TIMES INSTANCES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE RUNNING EMPTY OR RUNNING WITH LESS THAN FULL CAPACITY. IN THOSE CASES YOU HAVE CAPACITY THAT CAN BE FILLED. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS INDUCED DEMAND IN NEW AREAS AND THERE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SERVICE. THAT MEANS NEW VEHICLES THAT MEANS NEW OPERATORS ALL THAT COMES WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS OTHER THAN BORN BY THE AGENCY. I KNOW THAT IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED AS A CONCERN WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REALITY THAT RIGHT NOW. EVERY AGENCY IN THE STATE IS FACING AN OPERATOR SHORTAGE. AND SO IF YOU'VE MADE A COMMITMENT FOR AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT THEY CAN'T FILL THAT COMMITMENT THAT ALSO DOES CREATE SOME CHALLENGES FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. OR BY AGENCIES MAY HAVE TO BE PASSING UP CUSTOMERS BECAUSE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE FINANCIAL OR HUMAN RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. AND SO IT'S ACROSS THE SPECTRUM THAT WE HAVE CONCERNED. ON THAT OF COURSE WE ARE. INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO EXPLORE FURTHER HOW THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED- BUT THAT'S CHIEFLY WHERE CONCERNS LIE OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS MY HOPE THAT YOU KNOW IF WE ARE ESPECIALLY A YOUNGER AGE- REALLY ENCOURAGING. INDIVIDUALS USE TRANSIT. THROUGH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WHERE WE ARE FUNDING THAT- WITH ANY ANY INDUCED DEMAND THAT IS THERE- WOULD OPTIMIZE A SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY RUNNING- I THINK IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS TO SEE. WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE EXCEEDED CAPACITY AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL BUT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WHERE THEY'RE CLOSE TO THEIR AT- WE ALREADY SAID- RIGHT FOR. A LOT OF OUR- AND THE SYSTEMS AS IT IS I SEE THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BETTER UTILIZATION. OF THAT SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY REALLY- SPUR. INTEREST BY THAT GENERATION FOR THE REST OF THEIR ADULTHOOD AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THE BILL HAPPY TO MOVE IT AND I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ANYONE ELSE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES MILITARY FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE WERE SORT OF A EXCITED AT THE BEGINNING WHEN WE STARTED THIS MEETING BY ENTHUSIASTICALLY JOINED IN WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS RECOMMENDATION ON THE AMENDMENTS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE PRESENTATION FOR THE OPPOSITION. WAS NOT RECOGNIZING APPRECIATING THAT THIS BILL IS NOT. MANDATING OR OR- PENALIZING A BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR AND STAFF- ANY PROVIDER OR AGENCY THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED- OF PROVIDING A TRANSIT PROGRAM THAT THEY NOW MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN HOW THEY ALLOCATE THOSE RESOURCES SO I THINK WE ADDRESSED. ALREADY THAT CONCERN AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS ALSO REFERENCING AND THE- AMENDMENTS AROUND AND M. O. USE OF THOSE I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE- THE OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE THAT WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THE MONEY TO. ME WHY NO ONE WOULD WANT TO PARTICIPATE OR OR PUT THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND IF THE STATE IS GOING TO GIVE THE MONEY WELL THAT'S WITH THEM OR YOU IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. THAT IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY FOUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT A STUDENT TRANSIT. PASS PROGRAM LIKE THIS THE ANY ADDITIONAL MONIES FROM THE STATE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE TO AUGMENT NOT SUPPLANT. AND THAT'S WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO TO THAT END I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS AT LEAST THAT WERE PRESENTED I'M ALWAYS. CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND FIND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE A CONCERN THAT ARE THE REAL- BUT I THINK THE REAL SUBSTANTIVE ONCE A- BY VIRTUE THE COMMITTEE HAS. AND ARE ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED- I MEAN I AGAIN IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING WHETHER YOU REPRESENT A COMMUNITY. WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS- MY- SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO STATE. FRESNO YOU KNOW DOMINGUEZ HILLS THERE'S THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TODAY. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE ECONOMIC BURDENS THAT BAY PERSINGER FEELING AND THEREFORE AND AS AN EXTENSION THE PARENTS ARE FEELING. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT GOING ANYONE TALKSTO MOVE I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM FORWARD WHERE THE STATE AND WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET S. THAT'S THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS SO. I THINK WE THOUGHT WITH THE COMMITTEES ASSISTANCE AROUND THE CORNER AROUND ISSUES THAT. HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED AS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND TRY TO I TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. THANK YOU AND YOUR PASSION FOR THIS IS CERTAINLY CLEAR AND YOU- COMMITTEE COMPLETELY AGREES WITH YOU. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TRYING TO CREATE WRITERS AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WRITERS AND OUR STUDENTS ARE ARE OFTEN TRANSIT DEPENDENT AND THIS WOULD BE A HUGE BOON TO THEM AND I. APPRECIATE YOUR HAVING WORKED WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T INADVERTENTLY- FINANCIALLY IMPACT OF THE TRANSLATE AGENCIES AND PUT THEM IN THE POSITION TO TRY OF EITHER HAVING TO CUT SERVICE FOR INSTANCE- OR- A FILL THE MANDATES OF THE BILL. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING AS IT MOVES THROUGH ITS OTHER COMMITTEES. WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN HI FONG. FONG I BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. DALY DALY I DAVIS GIPSON. GIPSON I KALRA. LEE MEDINA MEDINA I NAZARIAN. WHEN O'DONNELL. WARD WARD I WICKS. SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU THE BILL IS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN OKAY NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE BY MR QUIRK YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY SIR. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. VERY GOOD. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT RAPIDLY EMERGED THROUGH START UPS IN RECENT YEARS AND AN INDUSTRY THAT STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP WITH YET. CURRENTLY MANY ARE DISTRICTS REQUIRE VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CONVENTIONAL GAS STATIONS AND THEREFORE PROHIBITS RETAIL MOBILE FUELING. DOES THAT USE BAKER RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS CERTIFIED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. FURTHER WHILE SOME MOBILE FEW ALERTS USED SOUND VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEMS THERE MANY OTHERS THAT USE STANDARD PICKUP TRUCK ST OPERATE UNREGULATED DUE TO OUTDATED DISTRICT RULES. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE INITIATES UP TO DATE LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOBILE FUEL INDUSTRY. THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY ALLOW COMPLIANT MOBILE FUEL ORDERS TO OPERATE MORE SMOOTHLY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. WILL ALSO ENTER IT WILLALSO ENSURE THAT OPERATIONS ACROSS THE STATE MEET THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. ALL IN THE ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED STATED THAT THE BILL WILL UNDER MY DISTRICT REGULATION OF STATIONARY SOURCES. I CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO KNOWLEDGE JUST THE LANGUAGE IN THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE REGION WHERE DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL REGULATIONS. PREVENT THIS I WILL AMEND THE BILL. TO ALLOW AIR DISTRICTS TIME TO EITHER ADOPT THEIR OWN RULES. OR ADOPT A- FOR EXAMPLE MOBILE FUELING FROM PERMITTING. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS TO SEE WHAT THE TIME SCALE FOR THAT SHOULD BE- SO THIS WOULD PREVENT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL THE OTHER THING IS THIS NOW IS ENTIRELY RUN BY THE LOCAL DISTRICTS SO THEY HAVE FULL REGULATION THEY HAVE FULL. AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE AND VERY HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE. ARE THAT ARE DOING THE MOBILE FUELING. DOT MOBILE FUELING CAN ALSO HELP THE TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS BY DISPENSING NEW NEW ALTERNATIVE FUELS I AM THIRTY MINUTES AWAY. FROM THE CLOSEST HYDROGEN FUEL CELL STATION. OF IFSOMEBODY WERE DELIVERING HIJINKS TO ME I'D BE VERY HAPPY. IN ADDITION WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE IN WHEELCHAIRS AND OTHERS WHO ARE DIFFERENTLY ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUEL THEY NEED. BY BRINGING FUEL TO FLEETS THE NET AMOUNT OF FUEL USED IN POLLUTION GENERATED THROUGH VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS LIKELY REDUCE. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE IS CO SPONSORED BY BOOSTER FUELS THE UNITED SPINAL ASSOCIATION AND HAS SUPPORT FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES. AND FIRE SAFETY GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ME TODAY ARE JOE OKAY PAKU FROM BOOSTER FUELS AND DAN OKON FIRST REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO YOUR WITNESSES. FEW MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU DR QUIRK CHAIR FRIEDMAN VICE CHAIR FONG AND ON A REAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOSEPH A POCKET WHEN I AM THE CHIEF POLICY OFFICER FOR BREWSTER A MOBILE ENERGY DELIVERY COMPANY AND A SPONSOR OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU. I LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING CHAIR FRIEDMAN FOR HEARING THE BILL TODAY. MOBILE FRIEDMAN ITS- MOBILE FEELING EXCUSE ME. IT'S A NEW INDUSTRY THAT WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE I AND I AM A I AM A PREFERRED FOR. YEAH I'LL NEVER LIVE THAT ONE DOWN. FOR THANK TO MOBILE FUELING THE NEW INDUSTRY THAT WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE IDEA WHAT IF YOU'LL COULD BE DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST LIKE THE SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES FOR WHOM ACCESS TO GAS STATIONS. IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. LOBAL FEELING IS THE GREENEST WAY TO DELIVER FUEL BECAUSE IT REDUCES BILL AT SPILLAGE ARE YOU SICK USING SPECIALLY TRAINED EMPLOYEES WHO AVOID COMMON FUELING MISTAKES. IT REDUCES VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND EMISSIONS BY BEING ABLE TO FEEL MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED VEHICLES WITH JUST ONE TANKER. THEREBY ELIMINATING HUNDREDS OF TRIPS TO THE GAS STATION. AND IT REDUCES RELIANCE ON UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS AT GAS STATIONS WHICH OFTEN WE CAN TO OUR GROUND. GLOBAL ENERGY DELIVERY IS ALSO KEY TO ACCELERATING ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. LIKE BRICK AND MORTAR STATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE LESS THAN 2% OF GAS STATIONS CURRENTLY OFFER RENEWABLE DIESEL. BUT BOOSTER BEGAN OFFERING RENEWABLE DIESEL JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO AND ALREADY WE HAVE CONVERTED 95% OF OUR DIESEL CLIENTS TO RENEWABLE DIESEL. THE SAME PROMISE EXISTS WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS SUCH AS HYDROGEN AND EASY CHARGING. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO OUTDATED RULES MORE THAN HALF OF THE THIRTY FIVE AIR DISTRICTS AND CALIFORNIA BAR MOBILE FEELING. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE AIR DISTRICTS TO ENACT RULES FOR MOBILE FEELING IN A MANNER THAT ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN THREE KEY WAYS. NUMBER ONE ONLY CARPET CERTIFIED MOBILE FEELERS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE. TO EACH DISTRICT WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN THROUGHPUT LIMITS SENSITIVE RECEPTORS STANDARDS. AND OTHER MEASURES TO ADDRESS DISTRICT SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. AND THREE AS DR QUICK MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE MOBILE FUELING INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED FIFTY TIMES WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGER CAN I HAVE A FINISH UP BECAUSE YOU'RE OVER THE TWO MINUTES. WITH THAT WE HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL APPROVE THE BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. NONE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN OPEN PLUS. PUBLIC POLICY. MANAGER FOR THE C. F. I'LL SEE THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. I'M HERE TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIVE SIX THREE. WHICH PROPOSES A MORE CONSISTENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR MOBILE FEELING. AND PROVIDES A SAFE AND HEALTHY ACCESS TO- FEELING. WE ARE STATEWIDE DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS SERVICES THE MEMBERSHIP. ASSOCIATION FOR ITS CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FIVE. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. I WANT PRESS INDEPENDENT LIVING- WE ARE PURPOSES SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH ALL TYPES OF DISABILITIES. IN MAINTAINING A BECOMING INDEPENDENT WITH. TOO MANY RESOURCES AND OUR ASSISTANCE OR TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY MAY NEED. AND WE SERVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE. I SEE A FILE C. IS ASO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIANS FOR SMART FEELING THE COALITION WITH YOU TODAY THAT IS URGING POLICY MAKERS TO ALLOW MOBILE FEELING. BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. MANY OF US STILL NEED AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE GAS STATION. FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ACCESS TO CONVENTIONAL GAS STATION OFTEN BROOMS PROVES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. GAS STATIONS ARE NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND AS AN EXAMPLE I AM A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY I HAVE DWARFISM WHICH IS A FORM OF SKELETAL DYSPLASIA I AM SHORTER THAN AVERAGE ABOUT FOUR FEET SIX INCHES TALL. AND LITERALLY I LEVEL WITH AND THOSE LEVEL WITH GAS PUMPS AND THE NOZZLES AND I'M ALSO INHALING THE FUMES AS A PRINT AS I- PUMP UP. IT DOESN'T STOP THERE I ALSO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE POINT OF SALE DEVICE TO. READ MY CREDIT CARD. I'M SPEAKING FOR THOUSANDS OF CALTRAIN DRYERS DISABILITIES WHO CAN'T GET AN ATTENDANT. THEY ALSO COME OUT OF THE STATION OFFICER COMMAND STORE THE COME OUT PUT MY GAS. BECAUSE THEY'RE USUALLY THE ONLY ONE TO TEN ON DUTY AND HERE SHE CAN'T LEAVE THE CASHIER. LESS AGO ACROSS THE BOARD ORGAN WHICH HAS FULL SERVICE SO INTENT. THE MOBILE FEELING ON THE MAN IS A RAPIDLY GROWING SERVICE THAT OFFERS PEOPLE DISABILITIES. A HEALTHIER MORE CONVENIENT AND ECONOMICAL ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE. OPTIONS FOR FILLING UP. WE ENCOURAGE YOU YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M- WE HAVE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- BRENDAN TWICE. LEAVING THE ROOM. THANK YOU. AND YOU JUST NEED TO PUSH THE BUTTON BEFORE YOU SPEAK I DID THANK YOU I THINK OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF BRENDAN TELLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND DEDICATED TO IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDING CLEAN AIR FOR ALL OUR RESIDENTS WERE RESPECTFULLY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE CAPCO IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CANCER CAUSING. TOXIC EMISSIONS AS WELL AS THE CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OPERATIONS THAT'S WHY INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN TAKING A THOUGHTFUL AND MEASURED APPROACH TO HOW THEY APPROACH THE ISSUE OF ON DEMAND MOBILE FEELING TAKING IN ACCOUNT CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS AND CONDITIONS THIS BILL ABANDONS THAT THOUGHTFUL APPROACH BY REQUIRING AIR DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISH UNIFORM PERMITTING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THEIR DISTRICTS FOR ON DEMAND TANK VEHICLE OPERATIONS INCLUDING SETTING UNIFORM NEW SOURCE REVIEW STANDARDS. THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS ACTUALLY COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT MANDATES REQUIRING AIR DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT PERMITTING AND NEW SOURCE REVIEW RULES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL REGIONAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS. IN EFFECT UNDER THIS BILL A SMALLER AIR DISTRICT LIKE MODOC WITH A POPULATION OF AROUND TEN THOUSAND. WOULD EITHER HAVE TO GO ABOUT THIS THE SAME AS SAN DIEGO. OR ALTERNATIVELY SAN DIEGO WOULD HAVE TO GO ABOUT THINGS THE SAME WAY AS MODOC. FOUR IT WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WHICH CAN LOWER PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION DEPENDING ON THE AIR DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. MEMBERS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND PROCESS IS WORKING AS INTENDED BOOSTER FUELS IS OPERATING IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST AIR DISTRICTS INCLUDING THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. SACRAMENTO AREA SAN DIEGO VENTURE AS WELL AS PLASTER COLLECTIVELY THESE AIR DISTRICTS COMPRISE CLOSE TO EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE STATE'S POPULATION YET. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF BOOSTER FUELS. ONE COMPANY. COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE BOOSTER FUELS TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS IN WHICH THEY WANT TO OPERATE INSTEAD OF PURSUING POLICIES THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION FOR AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE. I SEE ONE COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE THING TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. C. THREE.

MISTER GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TRY NOT TO SPEAK ON EVERY BILL THE SPECIAL BILLS- LIKE I TRY NOT TO DO THAT BUT CERTAINLY- I WANT TO ASK THE FIRST WELL THE ONE THING THE OFFICE FOR BRING THIS BILL BEFORE US I KNOW THAT- THAT- THIS IS A WAY TO ONE GUY AND GET AND USE THE TIMES MOBILE FUELING I THINK IT REALLY SPEAKS OF THE MODERN DAY IN THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND IT ALSO PROVIDES I THINK OF THE- FOR THOSE WHO'VE TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF. THE ABILITY TO- TO MEET PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE- WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE DISABILITIES OR WHATEVER IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE- THEIR THEIR NEEDS BEING MET- BECAUSE WE GO TO FILLING STATION- THEY'RE NOT BEING MET BASED ON WHAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER IN SUPPORT OF INDUSTRY- ILLUSTRATED SO I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR THIS BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THIS BRINGS US INTO AN AGE WHERE. WE SHOULD LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES OF TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER LIVE VIEW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR WARD. THANK YOU I'M REALLY PURSUE THE AUTHOR BRING THIS FOR AND I SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE PROMOTE HERE AND THAT SAID IT FEELS LIKE IT'S RUNNING COUNTER TO WHERE I WOULD HOPE THINGS ARE GOING LONG MORE LONGER RANGE- PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE TRYING TO WEAN OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS AMY- POTENTIAL APPLICATION THAT COULD MOVE TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELS YET IT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE AUTHORIZING THE- DELIVERY ANY ADMINISTRATION OF GASOLINE- AND RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT HERE IN THE IN THE BILL ITSELF. AND SO COUPLE THINGS ONE- I A I AM FUNDAMENTALLY IS SYMPATHETIC AND I AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE WITH CHALLENGES OR OTHER OTHER DISABILITIES. WHO ARE HAVING ACCESS ISSUES RIGHT NOW BUT THIS WOULD PROGRAM WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE LIMITED TO INDIVIDUALS OF THOSE CHALLENGES. RIGHT THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY TO USE YEAH THE ONE OF THE PRIMARY- CASES WOULD BE FLEETS. I AM VERY YEARS INSTEAD OF HAVING HUNDREDS OF CARS GO TO A STATION YOU HAVE ONE- ONE TANK ONE TANK COME AROUND AND FEEL ALL THE CARS THEREFORE REDUCE THE MILES TRAVELED- AND ALSOAS YOU SAID IT'S NOT JUST RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THEIR DIESEL CUSTOMERS AND BROUGHT THEM OVER POSTER FEELS HAS OVER TO RENEWABLE DIESEL IS ALREADY OPERATING IN THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL SPACE. AND YOU HEARD THE HYDROGEN COALITION SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF EARLY CAN HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED HYDROGEN STATIONS AS A HYDROGEN CAR USER I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO HAVE THIS OPTION. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT IN TODAY'S DYNAMIC SIDE LIKE TO SEE DOWN THE ROAD HOW WE ARE ME TRANSFORMING A LOT OF OUR GOT THE SENSORS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN SORT OF DEVELOPED. NOT PERFECTLY BUT GENERALLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CONSUMER NEED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION AND SORT OF THE- THE- THE HOW THINGS ARE SORT OF LAID OUT YOU KNOW ON THE MAP- AND I HOPE THAT WHETHER IT'S EASY OR HYDROGEN THAT THOSE WILL ALSO BECOME POINTS OF SALE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. AND UNTIL THAT TIME IS FOR FILL IN THAT GAP I COULD SEE THIS BEING USEFUL BUT BUT IS NOT LIMITED I FEEL AS THOUGH IF THIS WERE IN PLACE NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF TANKERS JUST TRAVELING. RESIDENTIAL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND THE STEAM IT IT IT I I'M WORRIED THAT WELL CAN INDUCE- SOME MORE PROBLEMS THAN IN SOME OF THE- BENEFITS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE. WELL I THINK IT WOULD IN FACT. GIVE YOU MORE BENEFITS ARE I WOULDN'T BE UP HERE- LOOK ALREADY 80% OF THE POPULATION DOES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING THE OTHER TWENTY PERCENT. THE ANSWER IS IT'S UNREGULATED. FELLOW IF THURSDAY ARE EXEMPTION FOR SMALLER. VEHICLE DELIVERIES WHAT IS IT HOW MANY GALLONS. A RANGERS FROM USUALLY ONE TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GALLONS YEAH SO IF YOU'RE- IN A- PICKUP TRUCK AND YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GALLONS. YOU CAN FUEL ANYWHERE YOU WANT AND WHAT KEPCO HAS SAID AND I AGREE WITH THEM THIS COULD THIS IS DANGEROUS. ON THE OTHER HAND BOOSTER FUELS IS ALLOWED TO OPERATE BOTH IN THE BAY AREA. AND IN THE SOUTH COAST AND THE REASON THEY'RE WHO HELPED OPERATE IS THEY DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE SMALLER OPERATORS DO AND YET THEY'RE ALLOWED TO OPERATE AND BOOSTER FUELS IS NOT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BRING THE MOST APPROPRIATE TECH OUR CLEAN AIR TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE WHOLE STATE. AND NOT JUST ALLOW- PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU NOT HAVE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE OUT THERE. ARE FUELING UNLESS THE AIR DISTRICT ITSELF FIVE THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT NOW ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP HERE TODAY IS WE'RE WILLING. SELECT AIR DISTRICTS. FROM UP WITH THEIR OWN REGULATION AS LONG AS IT FITS. LONG AS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH DOING THE RIGHT THING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND NOT ALLOWING THESE GASES. TO POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO THIS IS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. SOMETHING TO BRING THE REST OF THE STATE UP TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THAT ARE NEEDED. I WANT TO NEGOTIATE WITH CAP COLA SO THAT EACH OF THOSE DISTRICTS. AND SET UP THEIR OWN RULES AND WE CAN WORK ON HOW THE BILL IS STATED. WE CAN WORK ON THE TIME LINE. BUT THAT'S MY INTENT THAT WILL MAKE THIS A CLEANER HEALTHIER AIR FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE THANK YOU DR PARK AND I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD DO THAT AS AN AUTHOR AS WELL I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME MORE COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES I'M JUST NOT. VISIONING IT RIGHT NOW- BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW THIS- HOW THIS PLAYSOUT. YOU'RE MY FRIEND ANYWAY. MISTER KALRA THANK YOU ADAM CHEN THANK YOU SUMMER A CORK ON ON THAT LAST POINT BECAUSE I DID SERVE ON THE COURT YOUR CALL MATCH DISTRICT BOARD SO I DEFINITELY- I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE SOME SUCH FROM NATION- AND SO. IF BUT I'LL AND I ALSO VERY MUCH KNOW HOW YOU OPERATE AND TRIED TO- WORK TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND FIND TO- WEBER THERE ARE COMMON GOALS- BUT- TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND SO ON THAT POINT IN TERMS OF. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I AGREE WITH UNREGULATED PART OF IT LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE UNREGULATED PICKUP TRUCKS RUNNING AROUND IS FILLING UP. THAT'S NOT TENABLE- AND OF THE OTHER ASPECT OF IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WHICH IS A GOOD THING AS I'VE SEEN A COUPLE GAS STATIONS CLOSE- I THINK WE NEEDED. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE SEE MORE OF THOSE HAPPEN OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW THE GAS STATIONS IN THEMSELVES- TAKEN NORMA'S AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO CLEAN UP ONCE THEY CLOSE OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL WE HAD OUR FIRST. HYDROGEN STATION I THINK IT'S ALMOST TEN YEARS I THINK WE STILL ONLY HAVE THAT ONE. BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE- AND SO I'M VERY INTRIGUED BY THE- FUTURE APPLICATIONS CERTAINLY OF MOBILE HYDROGEN. WHICH I THINK IS REALLY THE KIND OF THE GOLDEN TICKET SO TO SPEAK OF THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN REALLY- EXPAND. UPON THIS IS A RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY BASICALLY GREEN HYDROGEN OF COURSE- TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES- AND DO YOU BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION A DOCTOR CORK IS- ARE THAT. YOU YOU MENTIONED TRYING TO WORK WITH OF CAPITAL AND WHAT HAVE YOU- ARE THERE. THE OTHER AREAS YOU THINK- IS THERE A MIDDLE GROUND THAT YOU CAN GET TO YOU BELIEVE IN THIS REGARD- I DO BELIEVE THAT- KEPCO MAY NOT BUT LOOK I'M WILLING TO SAY EACH DISTRICT WILL SET ITS OWN STANDARDS BUT IT CAN'T ALLOW. THESE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GALLON. OUR PEOPLE POLLUTING THE AIR AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALLOW MOBILE FUELING WHICH HAS ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THIS TO ME IS A REAL CONTRADICTION AND IT EXISTS IN THE 20% OF THE STATE THAT'S NOT ALLOWING. SO I WANT TO WORK WITH THEM. TO WORK ON TIME LINES WE CAN WORK ON WHAT THE STANDARD IS- BUT WE CAN GO FROM THERE IS THE MOBILE. PUMPING IS AS THE SUMMER WORE INDICATING LIKE GOING OUT TO COMMUNITIES AND PUMPING WHETHER IT'S FLEAS OR OTHERWISE DOES THAT. POSE A SIMILAR PROBLEM TO KNOW TO FOLKS THAT ARE POPPING UP AT THE GAS STATION OR IS THERE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE KINDS OF THAT CONDUCT WELL WHY DON'T YOU- I'LL HAVE MY EXPERTISE. A SERVICE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW AS WITH ANY INDUSTRY THAT IS NEW- THERE ARE- THIS IS IN THE EARLY STAGE OF POLICY DEVELOPMENTS- RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S BASICALLY TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF REGULATION ONE IS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE HERE DISCUSSING. ONE IS FROM. THE FIRE SAFETY SIDE ON THE FIRE SAFETY SIDE- A NEWS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE. STOP ME FROM GOING TO THE BUT IT'S A START WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FIRE CODE WHICH THE CALIFORNIA STATE FOLLOWS IN THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE. THE ADOPTED SECTION FIFTY SEVEN OH SEVEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHICH LIMITS THE USAGE OF MOBILE FEELING AND TO THAT QUICK POINT. THE REASON THAT THIS BILL IS ALWAYS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS IS BECAUSE THE PICKUP TRUCK SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY AS WE'RE CALLING IT. HAS BEEN OPERATING AND COMPLETE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF FIRE COLD ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING ON RESIDENTIAL STREET WHICH IS PROHIBITED. SO RIGHT NOW THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FROM A FIRE CODE PERSPECTIVE ARE A CITY IN AND OF ITSELF MAY DECIDE THAT IT DOESN'T WANT TO ADOPTED IN THE FIRE CODE. OPERATE SO THERE ARE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAD MAY BE INDEPENDENT OF SUCH AND WE JUST DON'T WANT MOBILE FEELING SO CITIES DO HAVE THAT POWER. B. ARE YOU MUST BE TEN FEET AWAY FROM ANY BUILDING YOU CANNOT FUEL ON PUBLIC STREETS. AND YOU MUST BE TEN FEET AWAY FROM ANY OF PROPERTY LINE SO. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARDS CONCERN WHICH WELL I DO UNDERSTAND I HEAR TO HEAR THAT A LOT- THEY- THE FIRE. CODE GEN- ALLEN'S HABIT THAT WE COME UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT HAVE TRIED TO REDUCE ANY SORT OF REST BY MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE A MOBILE FEWER. ON THE STREET WHILE IT'S CONDUCTING FUELING. BUT TO THE SAFETY POINT. THE PROCESS THAT MOLECULAR LIKE BOOSTER HAVE GONE THROUGH IT TOOK THREE YEARS OF ENGAGING WITH CARB. TO HAVE OUR TANKERS DOT TESTED PRESSURE TESTED ROLLOVER TESTED FIRE TESTED CRASH PROOF. THEY SET A ROUTE WHERE ADS AGAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GALLONS OF GASOLINE AND DIFFERENT CONTAINERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTIONS. AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRUTH THROUGH THE TRUE DANGER LIES BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE CAN OPERATE IT IS TEN TIMES THE B. AND COMMERCIAL- OR INDUSTRIAL AREAS NOT YET IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS DUE TO THOSE LIMITATIONS- UNDER THE FIRE CODE. THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION- FIRST OF ALL I% APPRECIATE YOUR- TIME THIS IS THE GERMAN FROM WORCESTER I APPRECIATE YOUR MEETING WITH ME ON THE BILL- I AM CURIOUS AS TO. OF YOUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THE DIFFERENTLY ABLED POPULATION THAT IS ACCESS ISSUES AND HOW DOES THE PRICING STRUCTURE WORK. FOR THEM SURE SO. THE ANSWER IS DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN OTHER PLACES BECAUSE OF PROBABLY NOT SURPRISINGLY- YOU KNOW WE OPERATE IN PLACES LIKE TEXAS AND TENNESSEE WHERE FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A LOT IT'S A LOT EASIER. I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE EXACT NUMBERS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTELE THAT ARE THAT ARE- DISABLE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ASKED THAT QUESTION BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A LOT MORE EVENTS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY CATERED TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS PRIMARILY WASHINGTON STATE AND IN TEXAS AND IN FACT. IF YOU HAPPEN TO TAKE A LOOK AT ABU SAYS WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE INFORMATION ABOUT- THE BENTLEY DID A FEW MONTHS AGO AND DALLAS TEXAS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CALL A POP UP GAS STATION. WHERE AS OPPOSED TO EITHER COMING TO YOUR WORKPLACE AND FINDING YOUR CAR WITH MOBILE FEELING YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESSENTIALLY FIND A PARKING LOT. POSTUP A MOBILE TANKER SET UP SOME CONES AND PEOPLE CAN DRIVE THROUGH WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THEIR CAR. AND GET FUEL YEAH I'M TRYING TO DO THIS IN LA A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO BUT AGAIN DUE TO REGULATIONS WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SO WE HAVE THOSE HAS OPERATIONS IN OTHER STATES BUT DUE TO SOME OF THE REGULATORY CHALLENGES IT'S BEEN A LOT LESS SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN TO YOUR PRICING QUESTION. ON THE CONSUMER SIDE THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE FLEAS BECAUSE FOR FLEETS WE WILL CHARGE SERVICE FEES BUT IF IT'S A CONSUMER BASED SERVICE OVER OTHER COMING TO YOUR PLACE OF WORK OR DOING A POP UP. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE CLOSEST GAS STATIONS AVERAGE OUT THOSE PRICES AND THAT IS THE MOST THAT WILL OFFER. SOMETIMES FOR VANS WE HAVE DONE YOU KNOW WILL DO COUPONS ARE WILL DO REDUCE THE COST WILL BE NEVER DO AN UP CHARGE THERE'S NO SERVICE FEE. THE MOST WILL EVER CHARGE TO THE DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER IS THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE CLOSEST GAS STATIONS OKAY SO IF I'M HEARING YOU THIS YOU REALLY HAVEN'T DONE. OF FEELING FOR THIS POPULATION AS A SURLY YET IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD INTEND TO DO IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE DONE IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN EVENT COMING UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT AGAIN IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING. NOT ONLY DO THE REGULATIONS BUT. FRANKLY- YOU KNOW COVERED WITH NOT. AND WE HAD TO. OUT A WHOLE NEW MATH OF OPERATE. THE WAY WE WORK THE WAY WE WERE DELIVERING IT TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WAS AT THE WORK PLACE AND IN FACT. THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED GETTING THE FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. OVERHEAD PEOPLE STOP GOING TO WORK AND THEN WE WERE NOT THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED BUILDING UP A FLEET BUSINESS SIDE BUT THAT'S ALSO WHERE WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE PUBLIC GAS STATION WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO MORE QUICKLY TEST. IN PLACES LIKE DALLAS AND WASHINGTON AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT WORKS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO BRING IT MORE TO CALIFORNIA. GOT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO MISTER CORK IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SURE. I JUST WANT TO ASK MY EXPERTS SO ARE THERE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DISABLED PEOPLE GETTING FUEL FROM YOU. MISTER PROXIMATE I WOULD SAY. I WOULD SAY OVER THE YEARS WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY GETTING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA THE IT'S BEEN LESS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S BEEN OVER AT LEAST IT'S IN THE THOUSANDS BUT- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT OVER THE YEARS. ALL RIGHT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GOT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. LOOK THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL. DEL IF WE CAN GO FORWARD AND AGAIN I'M GOING TO WORK WITH CAP COLA. AND MAKE SURE THAT EACH DISTRICT AND HAVE ITS OWN SAY ON THIS AND WE'LL WORK ON WHAT THAT STANDARD IS. WORK ON WHAT THE TIME LINE IS. ARMED I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT THAT'S WHY WE CHANGE THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHERE IT WAS GOING TO BE TOP DOWN. THEY OBJECTED WE SAID ALRIGHT YOU HAVE COMPLETE AUTHORITY. NOW ARE ASKING IS PLEASE EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY PLEASE HAVE RULES. RULES THAT WILL MEET THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS. AND RULES THAT ALREADY THE BAY AREA ON THE SOUTH COAST OF SAID YEAH THOSE ARE GOOD ENOUGH. SO WE THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE THINK THIS IS A POSSIBLE THING TO DO. I'M WILLING TO FIND OUT IF MODOC OR- ANOTHER AGENCY HAS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM. OF BUT THE STATE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL THEN DR KIRK HAS BEEN HE HAS BEEN. VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE IN ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE. AND IN TILL THIS BILL CAME FORWARD IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE FULL SERVICE STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA WITH A BARRIER THAT CAN BE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENTLY ABLED- AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW NEW JERSEY WHERE I THINK THEY ALL HAVE TO BE FULL SERVICE. I WHICH I PERSONALLY LIKE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE. SO YOU KNOW IT WAS A REAL- LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AS WELL- TO HEAR ABOUT THAT AND I DO THINK THAT THE- THE HYDROGEN. A CONCEPT YOU KNOW IF IT MOVES INTO THE FUTURE AND YOU'RE ABLE TO TECHNICALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT- ALSO FFER. OFFERS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES NOW THE REASON I'M A NOT ON THIS BILL TODAY IS BECAUSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CHANGE AND MÀ AND- AMENDED SO MUCH DUE TO OUR CONCERNS IS REALLY MUCH MORE OF WITH IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES JURISDICTION. SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT OF YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BE GETTING INTO THE MEAT OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK WITH THE- DISTRICTS IS REALLY GOING TO BE WORKED ON THAT'S OUT OF OUR- JURISDICTION HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I'M GONNA RESERVE WHAT MY OPINION FOR THE WHEN IT MOVES INTO NATURAL RESOURCES. BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY AND AGAIN YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ON THE BILL WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. DO PASTERNAK RESOURCES FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN IPHONE FONG I BERMAN HI BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM DALY HI DALY AYE DAVIES DAVIES I GIPSON AYE GIPSON AYE KALRA KALRA I LEE. MEDINA MEDINA NOT VOTING. THIS AREA. WHEN O'DONNELL WARD.

WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND A THIRTY MAY COME IN ORDERS THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY JAMES KEEPING IN MIND THAT YOU HAVE A SECOND AND A THIRD. YOU MAY WANT TO TEMPER YOUR COMMENTS. RIDLEY. AND YOU JUST NEED TO PUSH THE BUTTON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION AND SEVERAL SECONDS ON THE BILL- THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD CLARIFY THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN SHARE LPR DATA WITHOUT WITHOUT OF STATE OR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO LOCATE A VEHICLE OR PERSON. RESPONSIBLY RESPOND REASONABLY SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMISSION OF A PUBLIC OFFENSE WE DID- WORK ON TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFIED ADDITIONALLY THAT AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO WOULD ALSO CLARIFY THAT. LPR DATA CANNOT BE SHARED IT WOULD VIOLATE THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT- WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WORK WITH THOSE AND STAKEHOLDERS OF FINDING A BALANCE WITHIN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WITH ME TODAY IS WITH THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION COREY SAYS ILLEGAL. HEY LET'S GO TO YOUR WITNESSES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CORY CELLS ALONG BEHALF OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- IN LIGHT OF THE COMMITTEES TIME AND THE MULTIPLE EXPRESSIONS OF. HAVING THE BILL PROCEED I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I THINK- THE AUTHOR SAID IT VERY WELL WERE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MEMBERS TO MAKE SURE WE FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN. MOTORISTS PRIVACY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO USE THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOOL WITH RECOGNITIONS ABOUT CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE- ANDOPPOSITION BROUGHT FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WE DO HAVE ARE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND SO WE MAY VERY WELL COME BACK TO YOU WITH QUESTIONS- WE HAVE TRACY ROSENBERG FROM THE OAKLAND PRIVACY IN MEDIA ALLIANCE AND% SIERRA HUSSEIN FROM THE pELECTRONIC FUND. FRONTIER FOUNDATION I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE IN THE ROOM OR BY PHONE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE BY PHONE SO OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND- TWO MINUTES APIECE PLEASE THANK YOU. THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. MEMBERS HAS BEEN ON BEHALF OF THE ELECT CARE PENSION IN WITH OPPOSITION WELL WE HAVE SHE THREE AMENDMENTS MADE ADDRESS SOME ARKANSAS ABOUT THE BUT JUST PREVENT AUTOMATED LICENSE PATE READER OR LPR INFORMATION FROM ENDING UP IN THE WRONG HANDS PUTTING GREAT RISK TO PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA AGENCIES FROM SHARING ALE PR INFORMATION WITH OUT OF STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING AGENCIES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. IS A CRUCIAL TO PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN USING LPR INFORMATION TO LOCATE DETAIN AND DEPORT IMMIGRANTS AT LEAST TWENTY NINETEEN. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO WOULD UNDERMINE AND PUT IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS IN HARM'S WAY. EVEN WOULD BE AMENDED BILLS REFERENCE OF THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT THE BILL WOULD STILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA AGENCIES TO PASS ON A L. P. R. INFORMATION CHECK OUT OF STATE AGENCIES. EASILY SHARE THAT A- ON WHERE TO. WHEN I TELL AGENTS EVERY ABOUT IT. THE BILL WOULD ALSO UNDERMINE TELEPHONE STATUS AS A SANCTUARY FOR PEOPLE SEEKING ABORTION AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. JUST AS WITH THE I THINK DOUBLE ONE CALIFORNIA AGENCIES RELEASED LPR INFORMATION OUT OF STATE. THAT INFORMATION CAN EASILY BE TRANSMITTED ONWARD TO GOVERNMENTS THAT CRIMINALIZE ABORTION AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. MOREOVER THE AMENDED BILL REQUIRES CALIFORNIA AGENCIES TO ANALYZE AND BE CONSTANTLY APPRISED OF THE LAWS GOVERNING POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF LPR DATA. TO BE REQUIRING CALIFORNIA AGENCIES TO BECOME ARBITERS OF THE LEGAL RIGHT OF ABORTION SEEKERS THE L. G. B. T. Q. PEOPLE. IN THE CONTEXT OF DRIVERS AROUND. IT IS BOTH AN INAPPROPRIATE AND IMPRACTICAL SITUATION FOR CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES TO KEEP TRACK OF COMPLICATED AND EVER CHANGING LAWS OUTSIDE OF THEIR JURISDICTION. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE NINETEEN THANK. YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. I MY IS TRACY. ROSENBERG I'M SPEAKING ON WITH MUNICIPALITIES ALL OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THERE A. L. P. R. POLICIES. TO KEEP. THE DATA SAFE AND SECURE AS POSSIBLE UNFORTUNATELY THE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT LAW. AB. TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO. THANK WE WILL DO THE OPPOSITE MOST OF THE FANS BY OVER TWO FIFTY. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE STORED IN PRIVATELY OWNED CLOUD IT IT IT DATABASES DATA IS SHARED BY ALLOWING ONE AGENCY IN THIS CASE AN OUT OF STATE ONE TO QUERY AUTOMATICALLY MUST CALIFORNIA AGENCIES HAVE HUNDREDS OF OTHER AGENCIES WITH ACCESS. TO THEIR ACCOUNT IN THE CLASS AGENCIES IN OTHER STATES MUST FOLLOW THE POLICY. AND LAWS ARE ON THEIR OWN STATES NOT TO CALIFORNIA AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO AS AMENDED PROPOSES THAT EACH OF CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MONITOR STATE AND LOCAL LAWS ACROSS. FIFTY OTHER STATES AND THEN COULD YOU THEIR ENTIRE SHARING LIST OF WHAT COULD BE DOZENS OF INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES LOCATED IN THAT STATE THERE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY FOR THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING WILL AGENCY GOES THROUGH THIS PROCESS EVERY SINGLE TIME AND NO PRACTICAL WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE SHARING IS IN FACT CUT OFF THE EACH AND EVERY. AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA TO EACH AND EVERY. AGENCY TAXES. WAR IDAHO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT NO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. MORE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH AOP OUR PRIVACY LAWS THAT WERE PASSED OVER SEVEN YEARS. AGO AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS ENTERTAINING NUMEROUS DETAILS ON THE SUBJECTS OF. REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY THE RIGHT TO USE MEDICAL CARE AND SANCTUARY. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO WILL UNDER CRIED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM TAKE YOUR TIME OUR TIME TO YOUR TIME IS UP PLEASE IF YOU CAN FINISH.

IMPORTANT PART OF MY VALUE AND I KNOW MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS- SO I'M GONNA GIVE THIS A COURTESY AYE VOTE TODAY TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO SEE IF YOU CAN COME TO SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT WITH THEM WITH THE- THE COPY AT THAT I'M I MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT THOSE DIFFERENCES BUT OUT OF RESPECT YOU WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT TIME TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. BUT I DO SHARE THOSE CONCERNS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I'M ALSO HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS IF I CAN BE HELPFUL ANYWAY BUT ALL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY TO GIVE YOU A BIT MORE TIME MORE ON MY HERE. THANK YOU MISTER WARD THANK YOU ALL AND YOUR STOMACH'S GONNA COMPLETELY ECO CONCERN OVER WEEKS COMMENTS WELL APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE HAD EARLIER TODAY AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO WATCH THE IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRESSURE FONG. BUT LET ME SAY THAT- I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO IN SOME WAYS PUBLIC SAFETY HAS A- VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE SHARING OF INFORMATION. IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT WE'RE CONNECTING THE DOTS. AND TRYING TO PREVENT. A BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING- I AM COMING IN FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT BIFURCATING- IN CERTAIN STATES. THAT YOU CAN TALK TO IN CERTAIN STATES YOU CAN'T TALK TO. AND AGENCIES CAN TALK TO AGES YOU CAN'T TALK TO YOU. ABOUT THAT IS IT IT'S PROBLEMATIC TO ME BECAUSE- THE IN THE DAY. WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PREVENT- YOU KNOW HEINOUS ACTS ARE HAPPENING POTENTIALLY AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS FREE FLOWING INFORMATION- IS CRITICAL SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE YOU REACHING OUT EARLIER TODAY I DID GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE MEMBERS I I'D STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING- THE SHARING OF THE DATA PARTICULARLY. WITH OTHER STATES- AND IF I MAY BE THE OPPOSITE APPROACH FOR THE OPPOSITE ANGLE AS OUR CALL THE SERVER FONG. BUT IT AND SO- I MAYBE AM LAY OFF TODAY BUT I DO- BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED WORK ON THIS- WHEN AB YOU KNOW IF IT GOES TO PRIVACY AND COMES TO THE FLOOR- BUT- YOU KNOW HIS AS A FOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WHEN DATA STARTS TO MOVE QUICKLY ACROSS STATE LINES- WHEN- WELL YOU KNOW I THINK WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THE PRIVACY OF. OF THOSE THAT GET CAUGHT UP IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I ALSO HAVE A VERY- KIND OF- I GUESS IF HE OF THE MY NOT CRITICALLY WELL RIGHT NOW UP SENSE OF PLACES PLACE READERS IN GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT DATA. AND SO- WITH THE BENEFIT OF TIME BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SOME MORE AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ON BOARD AS PARTICULARLY WITH CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE- THE OPPOSITION ON THE PRIVACY SIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE PUBLIC MY COMMENTS- I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A TOUGH BILL- TOUGH BUT IMPORTANT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT TO SHARING THIS INFORMATION AND IF THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS A FUGITIVE WHO IS DANGEROUS WHO HAD COMMITTED A HEINOUS CRIME OF COURSE I WOULD WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO USE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE WITHIN THE LAW AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN OTHER STATES I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WOULD REALLY HANG IN THE BALANCE ON THE OTHER HAND IT' REALLY A SHAME THAT THERE ARE STATES OUT THERE THAT ARE PUTTING BOUNTIES OUT ON WOMEN WHO ARE JUST SEEKING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE TIMING OF WHEN THEY ARE TO HAVE OR NOT HAVE A CHILD OR OR CARRY A CHILD THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE- CRIMINALIZING OF PARENTS AND DOCTORS WHO WANT TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN WITH GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY IT'S ACTUALLY THIS BILL SHOWS THAT THOSE VERY ACTIONS ON ONLY DO THEY ENDANGER THE SAFETY AND HEALTH AND THE WELL BEING OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THEY PUT ALL OF OUR SAFETY AT RISK BECAUSE OF EXACTLY THIS KIND OF TREPIDATION TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH STATES WHO ARE FUNDAMENTALLY- THREATENING AND- CURTAILING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF THEIR CITIZENS AND CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE ACTING WITHIN THEIR OWN CIVIL RIGHTS SO- THAT'S WHY THIS IS DIFFICULT AND I THINK UP SETTING FOR A LOT OF US- AND- I DO A REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THOSE CONCERNS AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU HAVE AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE WHERE I'M HOPING THEY CAN CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS BILL SO THAT THOSE STATES DON'T USE THIS AS A WAY OF HUNTING DOWN- YOU KNOW VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AS THEY SEEM INTENT ON DOING A BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING US TO SHARE INFORMATION TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. SO WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MELCHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE OVER THOSE COMMENTS WE CONTINUE TO- KEEP AN OPEN DOOR POLICY HE- ADDRESS THESE- THAT MEMBERS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD- CERTAINLY TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE A BALANCE WITHIN PUBLIC SAFETY- WE SEE RETAIL THEFT ON THE ON THE RISE. WE SEE CERTAIN TYPES OF- CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. ARE MOVING FORWARD- AND- PACKED IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME TOGETHER TO STRIKE A BALANCE ON ON WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO. MAKE A BUILT STRONGER IN THE PROTECT PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS PROTECT OUR- IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN A MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. VIOLATE ANYTHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S VALID VALUES ACT HAS MOVED FORWARD ON BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO START THE DISCUSSION OF HOW DO WE BUILD THAT BALANCE TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT THOSE ARE THAT WE CAN- HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH A PROCESS LIKE THIS WITHOUT VIOLATING OTHERS OTHERS OUT THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE- CONTINUE TO HAVE AN OPEN DOOR POLICY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD GET TO THAT POINT. WHERE THAT BALANCE IS STRUCK. THANK YOU I'M WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. DO PASS TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FONG.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR YOU CAN PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. AND I WILL BE BRIEF ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS A SEPARATE TO SET UP A TASK FORCE TO HELP OR UNDERSTAND WHY ARE TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE MOST ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW POST CODE AND HOW THEY CAN MOVE INTO THE NEXT GENERATION AND- TO HELP US KNOW HOW TO BEST SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS WITH THAT I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL AS- WE START I BELIEVE WITH. BRIAN TAYLOR IN PERSON AND THEY WILL GO TO IAN GRIFFITHS OF THE SEAMLESS BAY OF SEAMLESS BAY AREA ON THE PHONE. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A SUPPORT SUPPORT. BOTH SIDES. TWO MINUTES IS ON YES NOT A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND BRIAN TAYLOR PROFESSOR OF URBAN PLANNING AND PUBLIC POLICY AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AT UCLA. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE PUBLIC TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL RECOVERY TASK FORCE. A CONFINEMENT REMARKS TODAY ON HOW PUBLIC TRANSIT CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROPOSED TASK FORCE. FIRST BY PUBLIC TRANSIT REFERRING TO THE BUSES VANS IN VANS AND TRAINS THAT SERVE THE DAILY TRAVEL NEEDS OF RIDERS IN NOT TO LONG DISTANCE INTERCITY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. I AND OTHER RESEARCHERS AT THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES OF THE UC SYSTEM HAVE BEEN EXAMINING PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE MODE FOR MANY YEARS AND WE INTEND TO DO SO AND IT CAN SUPPORT THIS COMMITTEE IN THAT. REGARD LEADING UP TO THE PANDEMIC OUR RESEARCH FOUND THAT PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WAS REPAIR ROADING IN A LARGE PART DUE TO INCREASED AUTO ACCESS IN TERMS OF BOTH HIGHER CAR OWNERSHIP. AND RISING RIGHT HE'LL USE PARTICULARLY AMONG LESS ADVANTAGE TRAVELERS. THE COMPRISE A LARGE SHARE OF TRANSIT USERS. IN THE PANDEMIC THIS SCRIPT SWITCHED IS MORE ADVANTAGE TRAVELERS HAVE ABANDONED TRANSIT IN PARTICULAR FORMER DOWNTOWN AND OTHER OFFICE CENTER COMMUTERS SHIFTED TO WORKING FROM HOME. OR DRIVING WHILE MANY LOWER INCOME ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE CONTINUED TO RIDE. SO WELL MOST TRAVEL BY OTHER MEANS HAS RECOVERED SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC PUBLIC TRANSIT USE IS STUCK AT ROUGHLY ONE THIRD TO TWO THIRDS PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND MOST CREDIT AT CURRENT TRANSIT USERS A DISADVANTAGE TRAVELERS. PERSISTENT DEPRESSED RIDERSHIP IS DEPRESSED FARE REVENUES WELL THE THREE PANDEMIC RESCUE BILLS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF HELP TRANSIT SYSTEMS WHETHER THE POOREST OF THE PANDEMIC. FINANCIAL SHORTFALLS ARE LOOMING FOR MANY PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS IS A FEDERAL FUNDING RUNS OUT. AGAINST THIS TROUBLING BACKDROP CALIFORNIA'S ASKING A LOT OF ITS TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO REDUCE CAR DEPENDENCE IN TRAFFIC CONGESTION REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SLOW CLIMATE CHANGE. PROMOTE CONTACTED ELEMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDE ACCESS FOR ALL. BUT SHE EVEN THESE GOALS DEPENDS ON PEOPLE RIDING TRANSIT. ANY USE OF TRANSIT NEAR HEAD IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY MYRIAD FACTORS INCLUDING THE ORGANIZATION FUNDING AND OPERATION OF TRANSIT SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS PUBLIC POLICIES GUIDING LAND DEVELOPMENT IN MANAGING DRIVING THAT ARE BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF TRANSIT MANAGERS. FENCES RECOVERY MUST BE ADDRESSED HOLISTICALLY WHICH IS WHY THE PROPOSED TASK FORCE IS NEEDED TO HELP CHART A NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION MISTER TAYLOR YOU TWO MINUTES ARE UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GRIFFITHS IN A PROCEED AGAIN THIS BILL HAS. A SUPPORT SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS IAN GRIFFITHS AND ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR HUMAN BAY AREA A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR A INTEGRATED. EQUITABLE WORLD CLASS TRYING TO CONTENT ACROSS. THE KOBE AREA AND BEYOND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. FINALISTS SICKLY STUDYING GOVERNANCE AND FUNDING REFORMS THE TASK FORCE CREATED BY THE BILL CAN LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE OF LEGISLATION AND FUNDING REFORMS THEY CAN MAKE TRANSIT FAR MORE EFFICIENT RELIABLE OPINION AND- AND HIGHER RIDERSHIP. ALL THE TIME AND- HAS BEEN IN DECLINE- IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING THE FOR THE PANDEMIC AS A WRITER IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY. OFTEN DON'T COME FREQUENTLY ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL SERVICES ARE RUN IN ISOLATION AT THE COURT TO ATHLETES GREAT NETWORK THEY DON'T LOGICALLY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER IN MANY CASES PROVIDERS. AND PAY SEPARATE FARES FOR EACH LEG OF THEIR JOURNEY WHICH CAN MAKE TRYING TO MARKET AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING ME BURDEN FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME IN TRANSIT AND IN CALIFORNIA. A RECENT MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE STUDY FOUND THAT REGION HI TRANSIT USE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE REPLICABLE IN CALIFORNIA. INTEGRATED FARES COORDINATED CASUALTY REGIONAL COORDINATION AUTHORITIES CONSOLIDATED RAIL AGENCIES AND INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICE FUNDED BY RELIABLE EIGHT FUNDING SOURCES. THE PROPOSED TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL RECOVERY TASK FORCE IN EIGHTY NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THEREFORE CRITICAL TO THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH A TREND IN CALIFORNIA I DID. INVESTIGATE ALL OF THESE CORE ISSUES. OTHER REGIONS HAVE YOU SIMILAR STATE PROCESS EACH BRING ABOUT THAT RENTAL FUNDING FOR. THAT ELECTED IN. TRANSIT YOU. THAT THE AUTHOR REPORTED AT THAT EFFORTS WITHIN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THAT WE HAVE BEEN PART OF TO BRING ABOUT A MORE COORDINATED EFFECTIVE TRANSIT SYSTEM TO OUR REGION. WE WELCOME THAT THE BILL WILL BRING STATEWIDE FOCUS ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT CAN COMPLEMENT EACH REGIONAL EFFORTS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE TRANSIT SYSTEM. SHOULD ALL WORK AS ONE TEAM WITH THE TIME TO THE RIDER TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO SUSTAINABLE BONTA TRANSIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION SO WE'LL GO TO THE- THE ROOM HERE IS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD.

THANK YOU GENTLEMEN PRESS ONE ZERO IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL AB NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. WE GO TO LINE SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS MARK BROOKS A BATCH INSERT FROM STREETS FOR ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE ON THE TOPIC THANK YOU. AND NO OTHER LINES IN Q. YOU MAY PROCEED MISTER CHAIR. OF THE OPERATOR BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. TINO QUESTIONS MANAGERS AT CLOSE JUST WHAT WE NEED TO HELP OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THIS WILL HELP GIVE US THAT ROAD MAP I WOULD REQUEST AN IPHONE WITH THE MOTION SECOND MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WHEN I O'DONNELL. WARD WARD I WICKS. TEN ZERO TEN ZERO KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WILL NOW GO TO FILE I'M ELEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SIX MENTOR YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK MY COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR HARD WORK OVER THE PAST MONTH THIS BILL WILL REDUCE RACIAL AND WEALTH WEALTH BASED DISPARITIES IN ENFORCEMENT OF MINOR TRAFFIC LAWS WHILE MAINTAINING ROAD SAFETY BY MAKING THE FOLLOWING POLICY CHANGES ELIMINATING LICENSES AND SUSPENSIONS BASED ON FAILURE TO APPEAR IN COURT. AND MAKING THE FIRST TWO OFFENSES AN INFRACTION FOR DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE AND REMEMBER THESE OFFENSES ARE ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S LICENSES FOR DO YOU WISE- THOSE TYPES OF TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY DIANA BECTON OF CONTRA COSTA AND TYLER NICHOL SMITH WITH THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH WE'LL START WITH CONTRA COSTA DISTRICT ATTORNEY BACK THEN AND THEN WE'LL GO TO- TYLER SMITH SO- A DISTRICT THIRTY BACK IN PLEASE PARTY WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE HERBS ARE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND PRIOR TO THAT I ALSO SERVED AS JUDGE AND PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOUR TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SIX- AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SIX WILL REQUIRE DRIVING WITHOUT POSSESSION OF A LICENSE TO BE CHARGED AS AN INFRACTION FOR THE FIRST TWO VIOLATIONS. AND IN LICENSE SUSPENSIONS FOR FAILURE TO APPEAR IN COURT. AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF COURSE I AM COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE DANGEROUS ANIMALS ARE COMMITTED TO SAFEGUARDING OUR COMMUNITY. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW A PERSON'S LICENSE TO DRIVE CAN BE SUSPENDED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO APPEAR IN COURT. THIS IS REALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP FOR COURT. WHEN WE TAKE AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO LEGALLY DRIVE WE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COME TO COURT AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THE THREAT TO LICENSE SUSPENSION. WORKS TO GET PEOPLE TO COURT NO ONE EVEN KNOWS IF IT IS HOT AND COMFORTABLE FUNCTION FOR DEALING TO APPEAR. THE PRACTICE IS JUST NOT AFFECT IT JUST INEFFECTIVE. IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY THAT EVERYONE WHO PROVIDES BE LICENSED AND IN SHORT. THE REASON MANY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS LIKE MYSELF NOW CHARGE DRIVING WITHOUT POSSESSION OF A LICENSE AT THE FRACTION. THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH DANGEROUS DRIVING OR EVEN PUBLIC SAFETY MORE POLITELY IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH POVERTY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO CHARGE TECHNICAL VIOLATION- OF THE CODE THAT ACTUALLY CAN CARRY A RISK OF SERIOUS HARM TO PEOPLE LIKE SPEEDING. LIKE OTHER- AND OTHER CHARGES LIKE SPEEDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS AFTERNOON. I THANK VERY MUCH S. A TYLER SMITH YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TERRY NICHOLS SMITH AM CURRENTLY THE MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR THE VETERAN CHEF WITH CENTER AT THE LEGALLY FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES THANK YOU TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SIX. I'VE BEEN TRAINING HAVE THIRD HUNDREDS OF LOW INCOME CLIENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE BLACK AND BROWN HAVE STRUGGLED TO OVERCOME THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES ANDROMEDA FACILITATED WITH THE CURRENT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND LYFT INSPECTION CONVENTION ACTIONS LIKE A NEW CONNECTION IN YOUR LIFE BENCHING CAN KNOCK AN ALREADY UNSTABLE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY FRTHER OUT OFWHACK AND PUSH THEM FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BILITY. ASCENSION AWAKENING OF THE LIFE EXPECTANCY TO APPEAR FOR EXAMPLE PLACES EVEN MORE CONSTRAINT ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OFTEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SELL THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND IT'S OFTEN THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE LICENSE SUSPENSION UNTIL THEY'RE STOPPED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT DUE TO THE DMV RECORD NOTICES. NEVER EVEN REACHING THEM. WE BE LIKE TO THANK THERE. TO THE AND- TO I MEDICAL DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TRANSFER. OR RISK IT ALL JUSTICE THE CONVO FOR ALREADY DOING. WHAT THEY CAN'T SURVIVE. BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO MAKE IT TO COURT. FURTHERMORE THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES THAT COME WITH THOSE IN THE COMMUTER CONNECTION AND ELECTED SUSPENSION. IN FAN EVEN YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL INCIDENT WHILE MISDEMEANORS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LESS. THAN A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION IS IN NO WAY HARM TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO RECEIVED THEM. THE CONNECTION IS A PERMANENT MARK ON THEIR RECORD EVEN ONCE IT'S EXPANSION.
