THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AYE AB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT SEEKS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE CAREER PATHWAY AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO EDUCATE. AND CARE FOR OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF WOMEN AND PREDOMINANTLY OF WOMEN OF COLOR. THIS IS THE WORK FORCE THAT OFTEN DOES NOT EARN A LIVABLE WAGE AND QUALIFIES FOR THE SAME SUBSIDIES. THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE USE. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. WORKFORCE ISSUES FOR OUR CURRENT WORK FIRST AND FUTURE WORK FIRST MUST REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR THINKING. THE STABILITY IS BROUGHT TO THE EARLY CHILD CARE EDUCATION WORK FORCE WHEN A SOLID FOUNDATION IN QUALITY. AND REIMBURSEMENT IS IN PLACE AND WE KNOW WHEN FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE PARENTS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORK FORCE AND CHILDREN ARE SET UP. SET UP TO SUCCEED LEADER IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE. THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILD CARE WORKED TIRELESSLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT EASY WORK FORCE ONE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATION IS TO SUPPORT COLLECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR FAMILY CHILD. CARE HOME PROVIDERS BOTH LICENSE AND FAMILY FRIENDLY AND OR NEIGHBOR. CALIFORNIA RUNS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR A DAY WORKFORCE BUT OUR CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT MEET THAT NEED NOR DO THEY SUPPORT THOSE WHO PROVIDE CHILD CARE. THIS BILL PROFESSIONAL EYES AND CREATES A STABILITY FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY MAKING QUALITY TRAINING AVAILABLE TO ALL PROVIDERS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AB THREE SEVENTY PROVIDES A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS BOTH PROVIDER PAY INEQUITY AND THE LACK OF ACCESSIBLE CHILD CARE. JOINING ME TODAY WE HAVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. RACINE AT RECESS AND LEVY APPLE D. GUESS OF MERRY GO WITH THE ADDRESS FROM S. YEAH YOU IS HERE TO ASSIST WITH THE TRANSLATION. AND DâN ERIN -- IS HERE REPRESENTING SCA YOU AND ASKS ME AND CAN ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. MY NAME IS RUTH SCENERIES AND FOR THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. I ALSO RUN A NONPROFIT CALLED WOMEN OF NOBLE CHARACTER. I CURRENTLY CARE FOR TWENTY CHILDREN SIXTEEN OF WHICH ARE ON A STATE SUBSIDY AND I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN OF MY OWN. I AM ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU D. W. ASKED ME AN STI YOU LOCALS NINETY NINE AND FIVE TWENTY ONE I LIKE THOUSANDS OF FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS NURTURING AND EDUCATING INFANTS TODDLERS AND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IN MANY CASES WE OFF AROUND THE CLOCK CARE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SO THAT PARENTS WORKING NONTRADITIONAL WORK HOURS HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN. I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY WORK AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT I GET TO LIVE MY CALLING. BUT THERE'S A VERY DARK SIDE TO CHILDCARE THE GOES BEYOND DIRTY DIAPERS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS. WELL I SUPPORT PARENTS SO THEY CAN MOVE THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY BY CARING FOR THEIR MOST VALUABLE TREASURES THEIR CHILDREN. I STAND THERE ALONG WITH THEM ON THE BRINK OF HAVING NOTHING. ONE DECISION MAKERS SAY THAT I DO VALUABLE WORK THE LAW SAYS SOMETHING ELSE THE LAW SAYS THAT I AM DISPOSABLE BECAUSE PROVIDERS LIKE ME ARE NOT EVEN SEEN WORTHY ENOUGH. TO BE COVERED BY BASIC WORKER PROTECTIONS LIKE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS COMPENSATION OR EVEN HEALTHCARE. I AM LITERALLY AN ILLNESS AWAY FROM LOSING IT ALL. I AM AN EARLY EDUCATOR IN A STATE WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND YET I DO NOT EARN A LIVING WAGE. INSTEAD I QUALIFY FOR THE SAME SUBSIDY I PROVIDE. CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY DID FOR ME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT UNABLE TO MAKE MY MORTGAGE I LOST MY HOME WELL LOSING ONE'S HOME IS TRAGIC ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER. THE EXPERIENCE IS EVEN MORE DRAMATIC BECAUSE WHEN WE LOSE OUR HOME WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING. MY STORY IS ONE OF MANY AND A GLARING EXAMPLE OF THE DEEP CRACKS IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY IMPACT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS LIKE ME. BUT OUR CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHO RELY ON US. THAT'S WHY I LIKE MY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SISTERS STANDING BEHIND ME HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THE RIGHT TO FORMER UNION AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED WITH THE STATE. WE WANT TO JOIN PROVIDERS AND ELEVEN AND ELEVEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE NOT ONLY SING IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR LIVES BUT ALSO TO THOSE OF THE CHILDREN AND PARENTS THEY SERVE. AS WELL AS TO THEIR PROFESSION ONCE THEY BECOME REAL PARTNERS WITH THE STATE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WE LOVE CARING FOR EVERY DAY AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN. THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE FOR EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. NUMBER THREE THAT ARE THE BIGGEST EITHER ON THE LIST OF THE MOST IS HE SAID DANIEL SAFETY THE PROBIOTIC WITHOUT INVENTED.

AT THE MOMENT THEY WE DON'T KNOW NINO THAT BY THE DAY SKILL LEVEL AND I'M COMMITTED ABOUT HOW THIS ARTICLE LAST. A LITTLE BIT OF A HASSLE MUST I THINK WITHOUT INVENTIVE WELL I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THE WORK THAT I DO I OFTEN WISH THE STATE WAS MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT ME AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER.

IF UP A LITTLE THEY LET HIM STAND. WILL LOOK AT THAT -- Là WHOLE SIGNIFICANT BESIDE A SEMI NOTHING BY WILL. COME ON NOW WELL THE THE NOT TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN AN ERRANT PAPERWORK BY THE AGENCY A CONTRACT MEANS THAT I WILL GO WEEKS WITHOUT PAY AS THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.

THAT'S WHY I AM HERE TODAY WITH MY PROVIDER SISTERS BECAUSE AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO FORM A UNION AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE.

THERE'S NO REASON -- IN HER CASE THAT JOB SHOULDN'T BE PROTECTED AFTER HER SERVICE TO THE TWENTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THERE'S NO REASON THE LAW SHOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO WORK ONE OR MORE PART TIME JOBS. AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO WORK AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF HOURS PER WEEK OR MORE. BUT WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS AFTER THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT TO TAKE TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTIVELY. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REFLECTION ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WHICH ALLOWS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LEAVE PERMITTED. BY CURRENT LAW TO BE STACKED TOGETHER POTENTIALLY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEAVE THAT ORIGINALLY INTENTION. THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE WHETHER LONGER FORMS OF LEAVE APPROPRIATE OR NOT BUT MY INTENTION WITH THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC TO PROVIDING TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE. FOR PART TIME EMPLOYEES WITHOUT CREATING NEW STACKING OPPORTUNITIES. I HAVE COMMITTED MY WILL REITERATE TODAY THAT IS MY INTENTION IMPROVE THE LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN THE BILL TO ADDRESS THE STACKING ISSUE. BUT I'M CURRENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO DO JUST THAT. WALL WE ARE IN AGREEMENT -- TO ADDRESS THE UNINTENTIONAL ISSUE I THINK I CAN FAIRLY SAY THAT WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THE BILL. WELL WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE CONTINUE TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON WOMEN IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR PREGNANCY AND BONDING LEAF. DATA FROM THE US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SHOWS THAT WOMEN TEENAGERS AND SENIORS ARE THE MOST LIKELY DEMOGRAPHICS TO WORK PART TIME. PART TIME EMPLOYEES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOWER MEDIAN FAMILY INCOMES. IN A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF POVERTY THAN OTHERS MAKING -- THIS CLASS OF WORKERS MORE VULNERABLE TO JOB LOTS OF HOMELESSNESS. US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S ALSO FOUND THAT WORKERS WITH LATIN AMERICAN HERITAGE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOCKED AND INVOLUNTARY PART TIME EMPLOYMENT EVEN AS OTHER MINORITY GROUPS OF EXPERIENCE REDUCTION IN INVOLUNTARY PART TIME EMPLOYMENT SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. AS THE STATE WITH THE LARGEST WHICH IN OUR POPULATIONS CRITICAL ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA ONE THAT IMPACTS CONSTITUENTS IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS. OUR BIOLOGY DOES NOT CARE IF WE WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME IN THESE WORK. THESE WORKERS DESERVE THE SAME RIGHT TO JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AS EVERYONE ELSE. AB TWELVE TWENTY FOUR ALSO CREATES ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SIX WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR AN EMPLOYEE WHO EXPERIENCES A SECOND. QUALIFYING EVENT WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THIS PART OF THE BILL WAS ALSO INSPIRED BY SITUATION WHICH IMPACTED A DIFFERENT ONE OF MY OWN STAFF. I MIGHT BE STATING THE OBVIOUS HERE BUT IT IS IN FACT POSSIBLE MEMBERS TO GIVE BIRTH TWICE WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. SO OFTEN NEW MOTHER TAKE SIX WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN JANUARY. AND THEN GIVES BIRTH TO A SECOND CHILD NOVEMBER SHE IS INELIGIBLE FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR THE SECOND CHILD. THE CURRENT LAW DEFIES. LOGIC IN THIS TIME TO A LINE THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT PREGNANCY ACTUALLY WORKS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL COMPOSED THE BILL BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY COMMONSENSE CHANGE THAT IS LONG OVERDUE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR RIVAL TODAY MEMBERS AND BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER OF MANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING AN ECONOMY WHERE WORKERS ARE OFTEN COMBINING MULTIPLE PART TIME JOBS. AND AND EVERY WORKER SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAY HOME WITH THE NEW BABY WE ALL ARE ALSO PEOPLE NOT JUST WORKERS WE HAVE LIVES WE HAVE FAMILIES WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH LIFE WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP OUR JOB. A PROTECT OUR FAMILY AND BE ABLE TO DO BOTH SO WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SHERMAN RECESS ARE THE OTHER HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED ALSO JUST A REAR ITERATE THAT. CONSTRUCTION IN AND OF ITSELF AND MANY TIMES YOUR MULTI EMPLOYER MULTI PROJECTS SETTING VERY TEMPORARY SO THIS WILL BE A VERY STRONG PROTECTION FOR A LOT OF MEMBERS [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHEN DOESN'T ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AND SO ANY OTHER ME TO SUPPORTERS. ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY -- OPPOSITION. AND FOR FOR REFERENCE FOR THE FOR AUTHORS THAT -- THAT -- WE'RE HERE IN THE BEGINNING I GIVE UP TO SIX MINUTES AND OFTEN TAKE ALL THE SIX MINUTES UP TO SIX MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE YOU CAN TO BEAT UP ANYWAY YOU WANT WITH WITNESSES. SO PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS FOR CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL. NOR OBVIOUSLY VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS LEAVE IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE COUNTY CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT SO IT APPLIES TO ANY EMPLOYEE WHO REACHES NINE HUNDRED HOURS. OR ABOVE SO WHAT IT DOES IS IN ADDITION TO SEE FOR A OR FMLA LEAVE AT THE FEDERAL EQUIVALENT TO CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT. IT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ANY EMPLOYEE THAT'S FULL TIME COULD BE TAKING UP TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF LEAVE WITHIN A ONE YEAR PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY IF A PART TIME EMPLOYEE WORKS NINE HUNDRED HOURS RETURNS TO WORK AND THEN WORKS THE ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS. THERE THAN ADDITIONALLY -- I FEEL THAT THEY ARE THE ADDITIONAL TWELVE WEEKS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO THEM THE OTHER CLARIFICATION THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST FOR PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE IT'S NOT JUST FOR FAMILY LEAVE FOR BABY BONDING. IT'S FOR ALL MEDICAL THE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER OR YOURSELF SO IT EXPANDS THAT TO AN EVEN BROADER GROUP OF PEOPLE AND AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHEN A PERSON CAN OR CANNOT TAKE OFF WORK. FOR THESE REASONS AND SO THEY CAN'T TELL EMPLOYEES SO AND SO'S OUT HOWEVER WE CAN LET YOU TAKE LEAVE IN SIX WEEKS OR SO AND SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ON LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT ONLY THE COST OF ALLOWING THOSE EMPLOYEES TO TAKE LEAVE -- BUT ALSO THE COST OF BACK FILLING THAT POSITION AND WHILE THIS IS WE UNDERSTAND IT'S AN UNPAID LEAVE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS -- TO ACQUIRE -- HAS TO AND MAKE AN ACCOMMODATION FOR SO OVERALL THOSE ARE CONCERNS IS THE ADDED BURDEN THAT THIS WILL PLACE ON EMPLOYERS NOTABLY THIS APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES. AND THAT IS AND YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF EM BUT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE US. A SMALL BUSINESS BUT FIFTY EMPLOYEES ADDS UP REALLY QUICKLY SO THAT'S JUST SOMEONE THAT OWNS A LARGE RESTAURANT OR A COUPLE RESTAURANTS CAN -- FIT THAT HIT THAT FIFTY EMPLOYEES -- MARK FAIRLY QUICKLY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AND WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION NAME TITLE AFFILIATION AND POSITION PLEASE. HELLO KATY HANSEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. HI IN THE NAME ONLY NUMBER AFTER THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES. OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY SO LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BE -- ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES SOME OF HIS OFFICE I DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I'M SORRY I AM. I USUALLY THINK OF A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON YES LAWS AND WHO THEY AFFECT. IN PLAIN IN THE SPACE FOR AWHILE. THIS IS SIX WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE RIGHT. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL. POSSIBILITY OF TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID IN MY READING THIS CORRECTLY. THERE WERE SPECIFIC EXACTLY TO PROTECTED LEAVE ALL JOB PROTECTED PROTECTED PROTECTIVELY BUT THE FIRST SIX WEEKS WOULD BE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. UNDER CURRENT LAW. UNDER YOUR BELT. THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST THIS BILL EXPANDS GOT TWELVE YEARS TWELVE WEEKS PROTECT TWELVE YEARS SHE'S. PROBABLY SERVER TARGET TIME WORKERS. SO. A PART TIME WORKER. WOULD IT TAKES SIX WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE. WOULD BE INCOME REPLACEMENT AT SIXTY OR 70%. THERE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR TO TAP THE FUNDFOR THE STE SIX WEEKS OF PAID MEN HAVE PROTECTED UNDER THE WHOLE. RIGHT SO WOULD BE 70% OF THEIR PART TIME. PAY. THE THE INTENTION THE BILL IS TO VERY NARROWLY -- OR AT LEAST VERY FOCUSED -- AFFORD. OUR PART TIME EMPLOYEES THE SAME -- BENEFITS FOR DRAWFUL TEMPLARS RIGHT AND I'M IDEA TO MAKE FURTHER REVISIONS BEYOND THAT BUT JUST TO CREATE THE EQUITY. WHAT? I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING I APPLIED WHAT YOU'RE DOING I I WILL ALWAYS VOTE -- TO EXPAND FAMILY LEAVE AND AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND JOB PROTECTION. JOB PROTECTED LEAVE -- BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE. TO ENSURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK -- FOR SMALLER EMPLOYERS PART TIME OR FULL TIME STILL DON'T HAVE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. THAT WE STILL I MEAN SO WE STILL HAVE. CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE. REALLY BASED ON WHO THEY WORK FOR HOW THEY WORK UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THEY WORK -- WE HAVE OF COURSE TEACHERS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES -- BEYOND THIS THAT I HOPE. AS AS YOU VIEW OTHER BILLS COMING FORWARD WILL RECOGNIZE -- KIND OF WHAT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER -- I I JUST I'M I'M CONCERNED -- THAT WERE WERE SOLVING A VERY SMALL PROBLEM WHICH IS IMPORTANT -- BUT NOT A LARGER ONE I WOULD ALSO WONDER IF -- INCOME REPLACEMENT ON A PART TIME JOB THAT IS 60% OR 70%. OF THEIR INCOME -- IS REALLY FOR FILLING RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING YES -- BUT A LOT OF PART TIME WORKERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAVE IF THEY ONLY RECEIVE 70% OF THEIR INCOME BECAUSE OFTEN A PART TIME -- ESPECIALLY WITH PARENTS PART TIME WORK ON BY MOTHER MIGHT BE IN THEY HAVE TO WORK IN ORDER -- TO MAKE THE FAMILY INCOME AND AND THEY'RE JUGGLING -- CHILD CARE DUTIES AT HOME AS WELL SO I'M JUST CONCERNED OR OTHER BILLS COMING THROUGH I KNOW THEY DEAL WITH ALL THE INCOME REPLACEMENT. AS WELL AS JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR FOR WORKERS WHO WORK AND AND SMALLER COMPANIES AND I THINK I AM I I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND AND HOPEFULLY MAYBE EVEN SOME POINT. WRAP ALL THESE IN TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE IS A LEAVE POLICY THAT COVERS EVERY WORKER IN CALIFORNIA AND LEE POLICY THAT ENSURES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE SIX WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE BECAUSE? YOU ARE YOUR INCOME IS REPLACED AT A LEVEL THAT THAT FINANCIALLY THAT'S EVEN FEASIBLE AND THAT YOUR JOB WILL BE THERE WHEN YOU RETURN SO I I THINK WE'RE AT THE SAME WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THINGS. BUT WE'RE PIECE MEALING AND MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS. I I WOULD AGREE I THINK OUR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED -- THAT OUR PHILOSOPHIES -- TO SOME DEGREE ALLIED AND YOU AND I AS YOU WELL KNOW ON MANY ISSUES DON'T ALIGN OUR PHILOSOPHY IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND I CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN INCREMENTAL PROGRESS -- WHETHER IT'S THE PERFECT -- OR NOT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN THE SPACE MEASURE THE THE CURRENT MINISTRATION THE CURRENT GOVERNOR HAS HIS OWN IDEAS. ON THIS SUBJECT THERE'S SEVERAL OTHER PIECE LEGISLATION -- I WALKED THROUGH THE DEBATE THE MERITS OF THOSE IN THIS -- COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME -- BUT I DO THINK -- THIS IS A KIND OF COMMON SENSE REFORM IN THIS BILL AND AN INCREMENTAL PROGRESS ON THE ISSUE OF MANY OF THOSE POPULATIONS YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT DOESN'T BY ANY MEANS -- NEGATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE -- YOU KNOW MORE DRAMATIC OR OR MORE AMBITIOUS -- UNDERTAKINGS. AS WELL BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE IS IT CRAZY A LITTLE BIT BETTER EQUITY WITH. PART TIME PLACE AND CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE WORKFORCE TODAY THE REMOTE WORKING MULTIPLE PART TIME JOBS. TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEN CERTAINLY AS IDENTIFIED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THIS NOTION OF NOT RECOGNIZING THAT YOU CAN HAVE TWO CHILDREN WITH A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD -- AND DISCRIMINATING FRANKLY AGAINST INDIVIDUALS A FINDING THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MAKES NO SENSE AT AND FINALLY IT JUST A CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY EMPLOYERS WITH UNDER FIFTY PEOPLE SO THIS -- THIS ALLOWS PART TIME WORKERS TEMP JOB PROTECTED LEAVE IF THEY'RE IT LINES UP WITH FEDERAL THE FEDERAL STANDARD NOT THE STATE STANDARD. BECAUSE IN IN THE STATE IF YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY WITH TWENTY OR LESS. YOU DON'T HAVE JOB PROTECTIVELY BUT TWENTY TO FIFTY IS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA BUT NOT IN THE FEDERAL LAW. SO I I'M I'M JUST THE LANGUAGE THE BILL IS AT FIFTY TO THE CAN LOOK AT ALIGNING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD -- BUT I I BELIEVE YOU'RE CORRECT IT'S FIFTEEN ABOUT. IT IS THAT -- YOUR VIEW OF INCREMENTAL OR SO SO. I I AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A MEAN WAY AS I SAID MY OPENING COMMENTS -- WERE WORKING AND MASSAGE IN THE LANGUAGE OKAY IS THERE SOME THAT'S WHAT I MEANT WHAT I DID WE'RE NOT QUITE OKAY THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T REFLECT WHERE WE'RE AT IN OUR DISCUSSIONS AND WITH THE OKAY GO I TRIED OUTLINED THAT YOUR COMMENTS -- I CAN CERTAINLY KEEP YOU POSTED AS WE BRING THE NEXT ROUND A LANGUAGE CHEN BUT I WOULD WE ARE LINED IN OUR INTEREST. THE INCREMENTAL STEP FORWARD NOT. BITING OFF EVERYTHING. YOUR TO DO AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST THINK -- FOR FOR EVEN WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO IF I IT WAS A PART TIME EMPLOYEE. AT A COMPANY WITH THIRTY PEOPLE MY CO WORKER THEN WAS A FULL TIME PLAY WOULD WOULD HAVE THE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I THEN AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS MAYBE YOU'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH WHETHER THAT'S THE FIFTY STANDARD OF THE TWENTY SKINNER MAYBE I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR YOUR STAFF SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS HOPEFULLY THIS COMES APPROPRIATIONS. THESE ARE THE KIND OF QUESTION INTENT WOULD BE TO CONSISTENT BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIE TO CHANGE. THAT WITH. CALIFORNIA WHAT IS LONG AS WAS DONE CALIFORNIA THINK WE ARE. YES THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD. THAT'S OKAY AS WELL. IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD IT'S BECAUSE WE DO NOT INCREMENTAL CHANGE THANK YOU I'M OF THE BILL THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER COMMENT. IF NOT I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW I I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK TO GOALS THAT THAT APPARENTLY SEEM SHARED. INTERESTS PROTECTING ALL WORKERS -- AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS -- TO RELEASE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OPPOSITION. AND THE NEED FOR MASSAGING -- I THINK EVEN IN THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS -- THE THE NEED FOR GREATER CLARITY MORE SPECIFICITY AND IT DOES IT THIS DOESN'T JOIN I DO PASSED TO INSURANCE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE. TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT THE RECOGNITION FROM SOME OF OUR GREAT THAT IS THAT THAT THAT THAT HE'S THE MORE WORK IS NEEDED IS APPRECIATED AS WELL. EIGHT OF HER IF I MIGHT CLARIFY MISTER YOU KNOW -- ON THE TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE -- ISSUE WE WERE TAP WE TEMPTED TO NULLIFY THE STACKING AND WE DISCUSSES WITH COMMITTEE STAFF -- BUT COUNCIL DIDN'T. ZERO IN ALL THAT THE WAY I THINK -- OUR INTENTIONS WERE HEADED SO THE NEXT SET OF AMENDMENTS IS GOING TO ADDRESS THAT WE DISCUSS THAT WITH ME STAFF AND WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED -- AS WE GET THAT -- DRAFTING AIR -- SHORT OUT YEAH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN YOUR YOUR STAFF'S WORK WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT. A LOT OF THAT CLEARLY CAN BE DONE BEFORE HITTING THE NEXT COMMITTEE AS WELL.

SEVENTY EIGHT ITEM [inaudible] EIGHT PLEASE ENTER [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE PRESENTING A. B.. SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER TRANSIT. TRANSGENDER DAVID VISIBILITY A. B. SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT OF THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES UNLAWFUL WORKPLACE PAY DIFFERENCES. OF EMPLOYEES OF ALL GENDERS. OUR CURRENT EQUAL PAY ACT ENSURES THAT EMPLOYEES OF DIFFERENT GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY THROUGH PERFORM. THE THING ABILITY SIMILAR WORK ARE PAIRED ARE PAID FAIRLY. THIS LAW ALSO DISCOURAGES PAY SECRECY BY PROHIBITING RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES WHO DISCUSS THEIR INCOME OR ASK COWORKERS ABOUT THEIR WAGES. AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT STRAINS CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT BY REMOVING THE GENDER BINARY TERMINOLOGY EXPLICITLY INCORPORATING NON BINARY PEOPLE INTO FOUR EQUAL PAY PROTECTIONS. AND CLARIFYING THE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. THIS BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT ONE A SINGLE CONFERENCE -- IS SUFFICIENT TO BRING AN EQUAL PAY ACT CLAIM TO WORKERS HAVE WON YOUR FILING DEADLINE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RETALIATION CLAIMS JUST AS THEY DO FOR FILING CIVIL RETALIATION CLAIMS. WHILE GENDER NON CONFORMING AND TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALWAYS OCCUPIED OUR WORKPLACES THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN LEGALLY RECOGNIZED. PRO TEM ATKINS GENDER RECOGNITION ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN PROVIDED FOR A THIRD NON BINARY GENDER MARKER OPTION ON CALIFORNIA'S IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE GENDER RECOGNITION ACT WE HAVE A DUTY TO UPDATE BINARY THOUGHT AS LANGUAGE AND EXPLICITLY INCORPORATE PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS AND TO EQUAL PAY. PROTECTIONS. TRANSCEND NON BINARY PEOPLE OFTEN FACE UNDUE SOCIAL ECONOMIC BARRIERS AND DISCRIMINATION. THIS IS THE PARENT AND THE TRANSGENDER LAWCENTER SUPPORT THE DESPITE RELATIVELY HIGH EDUCATION RATES TRANSCEND GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE. ARE UNABLE TO FULLY PROFIT FROM THEIR ABILITIES DUE TO WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION. TODAY WITH ME ARE TAMMY MARTIN LEGISLATIVE MANAGER OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA.

PLUS SENIOR STAFF ATORNEY OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WILL BE INTRODUCING HER KLEIN OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND THERE WAS A MOTIONS MISS AMERICANS ALSO SECOND THAT MOTION SO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TAMMY MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE OGT Q. CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AND PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S RESPECT FOR ITS DIVERSE POPULATION. AND UPDATE OUTDATED LANGUAGE IN THE STATE'S EQUAL PAY ACT. FOR TWENTY YEARS EQUALITY CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE GOLDEN STATE'S FIGHT FOR FULL LGBT Q. EQUALITY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SPONSORED THE GENDER RECOGNITION ACT AUTHORED BY SENATOR ATKINS AND SENATOR WIENER. WHICH ENABLED MORE PEOPLE TO OBTAIN ACCURATE STATE ISSUED IDENTITY DOCUMENTS BY CREATING A THIRD. NON BINARY GENDER MARKER. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL PAY ACT PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING AN EMPLOYEE LESS THAN AN EMPLOYEE OF QUOTE THE OPPOSITE SEX. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK. THIS BILL WILL UPDATE THE OUTDATED BINARY LANGUAGE AND ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES OF ALL GENDERS AND GENDER EXPRESSIONS ARE PAID EQUITABLY. WE KNOW THAT LGBT Q. PEOPLE AND TRANS GENDER AND NON BINARY PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR HAVE HISTORICALLY FACED HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIETAL STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION. A RECENT SURVEY REVEALED PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY PEOPLE IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS INCLUDING IN WORKPLACES. ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE RESPONDENTS REPORTED BEING FIRED DENIED A PROMOTION OR OTHERWISE BEING MISTREATED AT WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION. THIS PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY FOR TRANSGENDER AND NINE NON BINARY CALIFORNIANS ONE THIRD OF WHOM LIVE IN POVERTY. AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT IS A THOUGHTFUL AND NECESSARY UPDATE TO EQUAL PAY LAWS AND WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR ADVANCING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- IS JESSICA STANDARD -- FROM AT EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL -- AS ASSEMBLY WITH WOMAN CARDIO MENTIONED WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE -- AND I'M HERE TO INTRODUCE MY CLIENTS -- CORAL HAND IN WHO'S GONNA TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WORKERS HAVE THE SAME SUCH LIMITATIONS FOR FILING RETALIATION CLAIMS UNDER THE EQUAL PAY ACT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S IN. THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTACTS WITH LABOR COMMISSIONER OR IN A CIVIL CLAIM IN COURT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT UPDATES AND CLARIFICATIONS TO OUR STATE WILL PAY LAW. I WORK FOR A MAJOR GOLF RESORT. FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AS A ROTATIONAL MANAGER. AND IN THAT POSITION I WORKED SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS AT THE RESORT ON A ROTATIONAL BASIS. DURING THAT TIME I WORKED THERE I WORKED VERY HARD I DID MY JOB VERY WELL. AND I RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND EVALUATIONS FROM MY SUPERVISOR'S. AFTER A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OF WORKING THERE. I CAME ACROSS A DOCUMENT ON A SHARED SERVER THAT LIST OF THE SALARIES OF ALL THE MANAGERS. AND REFLECTED DISPARITIES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE MANAGERS. WITH THE MEN RECEIVING HIGHER WAGES. I IMMEDIATELY REFORM TO MY SUPERVISOR THAT I COME ACROSS THE DOCUMENT IN THE OFFICES DIGITAL FILES. AND GIVEN THAT IT HAD SENSITIVE WAGE INFORMATION I THOUGHT IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE PASSWORD PROTECTED. I ALSO RAISE A GENDER WAGE DISPARITY THAT WERE REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENT WITH MAJOR DEPARTMENT. AS FAR AS I KNOW NO CHANGES IN PAY WERE MADE AFTER I REPORTED THE WAGE DISPARITIES. A FEW MONTHS LATER I DECIDED TO TAKE ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE IT PAID MORE. DURING MY EXIT INTERVIEW THE H. R.. REPRESENTATIVE ASKED WHY I WAS LEAVING AND I TOLD HER THAT I WAS LEAVING EVEN THOUGH I LOVE MY JOB. AS I WOULD BE BEING PAID TOO LITTLE. AND BECAUSE OF THE PAY DISPARITIES I'D SEEN BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE DOCUMENT. THE H. R. REPRESENTATIVE THEN TOLD ME THAT MY SUPERVISOR WAS VERY UPSET. FOR ME HAVING RAISE THE ISSUE OF PAY ESPECIALLY HAVING TAKEN A TO HR. I EXPLAINED THAT IT ACTED NOT WITH ANY MALICE I'D SIMPLY REPORTED THE ISSUE TO HR BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THE NEW JOB DIDN'T WORK OUT AS I'D HOPED SO AFTER A FEW MONTHS I'VE APPLIED FOR SEVERAL OPEN POSITIONS WITH MY FORMER EMPLOYER. I WAS ALREADY TRAINED AND HAD EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THE POSITIONS. HOWEVER AFTER MONTHS OF APPLYING AND CONTACTING MY FORMER EMPLOYER. NOTHING WAS DONE I NEVER HEARD BACK. I WAS CONFUSED AND UPSET BECAUSE I HAD A GREAT. HAD BEEN A GREAT EMPLOYEE AND I FELT THAT I'D HANDLE THE SITUATION PROFESSIONALLY. BY REPORTING THE PAY PROBLEM THAT I HAD DISCOVERED. IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT THEY WERE NOT CONTACT ME ABOUT THE OPEN POSITIONS BECAUSE I HAD RAISE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY. APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS AFTER I RE APPLIED TO WORK AGAIN AT THE COMPANY. I FILED A WAGE CLAIM AND A RETALIATION CLAIM UNDER THE EQUAL PAY ACT. WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. INVESTIGATOR CONTACTED ME ABOUT THE EQUAL PAY CLAIM BUT I WAS NOT CONTACTED ABOUT THE RETALIATION CLAIM DESPITE MAKING REPEATED INQUIRIES. I FINALLY LEARNED. THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAD DISMISSED MY RETALIATION CLAIM. ON THE GROUNDS THAT WAS FILED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE END OF MY EMPLOYMENT. I FILED AN APPEAL ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE DEADLINE FOR THE FILING OF THE RETALIATION CLAIM WAS ONE YEAR. AS STATED IN THE STATUTE. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RESPONSE FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ABOUT MY APPEAL OF THE RETALIATION DISMISSAL. DESPITE REACHING OUT MULTIPLE TIMES. FINALLY THE INVESTIGATOR WHO IS INVESTIGATING MY EQUAL PAY WAGE CLAIM TOLD ME THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WAS UNABLE TO RE OPEN THE CLAIM. AND THEN IF I WANTED TO I COULD REACH OUT TO THE RETALIATION PUBLIC LINE FOR MORE INFORMATION. I HAVE SENT MULTIPLE REQUESTS THE RETALIATION PUBLICATION PUBLIC LINE BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING BACK. I FILED MY PEOPLE PAY. AND RETALIATION CLAIMS WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A LAWYER AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILE A LAWSUIT ON MY OWN. I THINK WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO FILE A RETALIATION CLAIM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AS THEY HAD TO FILE IN COURT. WORKERS ABILITY TO FIND A LAWYER AND A FILE A LAWSUIT SHOULD NOT DICTATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME SHE HAS TO SEEK THAT. JUSTICE FOR THE RICH BEING RETALIATED AGAINST.

AND OUTLINES THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A BUILDING PERMIT MAY BE SUSPENDED. HOWEVER CERTAIN ELEVATOR CONCERN ELEVATOR COMPANIES WHO HAVE BEGUN INCORPORATING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONVEYANCES HAVE KNOWINGLY INSTALLED ELEVATORS THAT FAIL TO COMPLY.

AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY GO WHEN WE WERE THE VARIANCES REQUESTED EVEN OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS.

BUT IT CAN BE SLOW THERE MIGHT BE SIX MONTHS WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL DURING WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB. LOOKING AT THE STATS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY TWO PEOPLE FILE TO SAY THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED RETALIATION FOR TAKING TIME OFF FOR SAFETY PLANNING. AND ONLY EIGHT FILE TO SAY THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED RETALIATION FOR SEEKING SAFETY ACCOMMODATIONS AND BASED ON THE STATISTICS WE KNOW IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T HAPPENING. IT'S BECAUSE THE PROCESS CAN BE SLOW AND CONFUSING. PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION AT WORK BECAUSE OF RACE OR SEX OR RELIGION -- THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET AN ATTORNEY AND ARE ABLE TO SEEK JUSTICE IN THE COURTS AND WE THINK THAT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JERRY DOYLE AND I HAVE A CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL -- MANY PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR CODE PROVIDE FOURS SPECIFICALLY FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY. TO DO THAT THESE ARE TWO PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR CODE THAT REALLY NEED TO HAVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. OPTION BECAUSE THEYARE MORE CONFUSING THEY CAN BE MORE HORRIFIC THE TO THE VICTIMS THAN OTHERS THEY'RE NOT NEARLY AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS SOME OF THE OTHERS. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE. YOU REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE KIND OF OPTION WHERE YOU CAN HAVE AN ATTORNEY. GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE TO SUPPORT. VERY GOOD YES HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER WITH LEGAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYWAY IN OPPOSITION. AT THE EVERYONE REMAINS SEATED IF YOU WANT THEIR SPACE IF YOU CHOOSE TO THIS COUPLE CHAIRS HERE. JUST SAID TO SHARE THE MICROPHONES. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MORE CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY OBVIOUSLY WE ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO VICTIMS THAT SUFFER THESE TYPE OF HARM. HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS MORE ABOUT THE LEGAL PROCESS AND WHAT KIND OF LIABILITY EXPOSURE THIS WILL HAVE FOR EMPLOYERS AND JUST TO CLARIFY. UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY AND THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL AND ALLOWS FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO ALSO FILE A CIVIL ACTION. THIS MEANS THAT THE EMPLOYEE CAN FILE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AS WELL AS FILE CIVIL ACTION SO POTENTIALLY PENALIZING THE EMPLOYER TWICE FOR THE SAME ALLEGED VIOLATION IT'S NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CIVIL ACTION. LIKE IT IS UNDER PAGO PAGO ALLOWS FOR ALL TURN IT OF REMEDY IF YOU DON'T FILE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. ADDITIONALLY AND IT DOES NOT EXEMPT RECOVERY UNDER PAGA SO REALLY THERE ARE THREE AVENUES FOR RELIEF PAGA. THE NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT THIS WOULD CREATE IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AM. THE ON THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL ARE ACTUALLY CORRECTED THE REMEDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT SUFFER DISCRIMINATION AT WORK BECAUSE OF GENDER RACE AND ALL THE OTHER PROTECTED CATEGORIES.% DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT CIVIL ACTION HOWEVER THEY STILL HAVE TO FILE AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SO THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY REQUIREMENT THAT THIS WOULD SKIP IN THE LABOR CODE -- INITIALLY THE DEAL IS THE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE CHAMPION FOR EMPLOYEES -- THEY WALK THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH THE PROCESS LET THEM KNOW OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY PROVIDE THE ADVICE FOR THE EMPLOYEE THEMSELVES ALTERNATELY TURN AND OF THE CURRENTLY UNDER THE LIFE THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE. THEY CANNOT AT THIS TIME FILE PAGA ACTION AND SO THAT'S WHERE CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS IS UNNECESSARY AND DUPLICATIVE ADDITIONALLY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN -- SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON RAN WITH SENATE BILL FOUR HUNDRED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WAS ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN THAT BILL HOWEVER THAT BILL. AMENDED OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BEFORE IT MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND WAS SIGNED IN THE ASSEMBLY IT AT THE AMENDED OUT VERSION OF THAT BILL THE REMOVED THE A PRIVATE RIGHT ABOUT AND WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS VERSION OF THE BILL AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARE KRISPY KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF A CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION ALSO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE% CALIFORNIA SPECIAL. DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY ON ME TO MANAGE THEIR OPPOSITION IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS THAT MISS CURTIS MADE. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT TO FROM OUR VIEW THIS AND WE'VE HARDLY BEEN FANS OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT. BUT THIS COMPLETELY UNDERMINES PAGA. THERE IS NO EXEMPTION SO AS MISS CURTIS INDICATED THERE ARE NOW THREE POTENTIAL AVENUES. OF COURSE WITHOUT THIS WITH THE NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THERE'S NO NOTICE TO THE D. LSE OR THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION THEY CAN GO SIMPLY TO COURT. AND THERE WILL BE NO SHARING OF FIND. THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AT THAT ALL GO ALONG WITH PAGA -- WE FEAR THAT THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO CREATING ALL NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. FOR OTHER LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS THAT FOLKS DEEM APPROPRIATE OR NEED IN NEED OF THAT. AND SO IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WE SHOULD AT LEAST CUT OFF THE AVENUE OF PAGO FOR GOING TO CREATE A SEPARATE PRIDE OF RIGHT OF ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE HAVE. MOTIONS. WE DECIDED. YEAH -- ANY OTHER COMMENT OR QUESTION. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A DO PASSAGE ISSUE RECOMMENDATION AYE AYE. THIS LABOR EMPLOYMENT I THINK IN TERMS OF GOOD LABOR POLICIES GOOD OUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS LEGAL PROCESS WHICH I THINK ARE MORE SUITABLE SUITABLE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS. AND SO I KNOW -- THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WITH OPPOSITION -- AND AND CERTAINLY WITH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STOPPING CHAIR TO ENSURE THAT SOME OF THE OF THE LEGAL CLARITY IS THERE AND THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING POSE. BUT THE OPPOSITION ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED IN THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE -- AND SO WITH THAT -- WHICH THAT CLOSES IN AMERICA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PROVIDES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHEN AND HOW. THEIR COMPLAINT OF AN EMPLOYER MISCONDUCT IS HEARD THE ABILITY TO GARNER DAMAGES FOR THE HARM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN COST. AND THE RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION BY AN ATTORNEY WHO IS PARTICULARLY EQUIPPED TO DEFEND THE SURVIVORS BEST INTEREST I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANKS WE DO HAVE A MOTION KALRA PLEASE. THE PAST TWO JUDICIARY KALRA FIVE KALRA AYE FLORA CREEL HI CREEL AYE DEEP. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ SIDE JONES SAWYER. THREE OF US. OKAY SO THAT BILLS OUT TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NEXT. THANK YOU. SENATE MEMBER AND SALAS. LINE ITEM OF ONE EIGHTY FIVE HOW AND AND ONCE AGAIN FOR EVERYONE'S BENEFIT -- AS WE HEAR THIS BILL JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER BILL -- THERE WILL BE SIX MINUTES. OF A PER SIDE AND I KNOW THAT BOTH FOLKS THAT WERE FOR AND AGAINST THIS CARE MANY CAME TO THE INFORMATION HEARING WERE ALLOWED. MORE GENEROUS COMMENTARY WHEN WE GET THE PUBLIC COMMENT AGAIN JUST LIKE THE OTHER BILLS -- NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION -- BUT WITH THAT LET US -- BEGIN WITH -- BUT WITH A SUMMARY GONZALEZ PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS MONTH MARKS ONE YEAR SINCE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY ISSUED THE LANDMARK. DYNAMICS RULING AGAINST A NEGLIGENT COMPANY THAT WAS MISSED CLASS FINE IT'S DRIVERS IS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS JUST TO SAVE A BUCK. THIS DECISION REPRESENTS WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANCES IN WORKERS RIGHT IN RECENT HISTORY. THE ISSUE OF WORKER BEES CLASSIFICATION IS NOT NEW AND IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY A PRODUCT OF THE MODERN DAY GIG ECONOMY. COMPANIES HAVE EXPLOITED WORKERS FOR DECADES BY USING UNLAWFUL CONTRACTING PRACTICES IN INDUSTRIES LIKE CONSTRUCTION JANITORIAL SERVICE TRUCKING. DELIVERY AND NAIL SALONS. THE DYNAMICS RULING WITH THE MORAL PROCLAMATION BY CALIFORNIA'S HIGHEST COURT WITH A MESSAGE THAT RING LOUD AND CLEAR. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH GOVERNMENT CANNOT SIMPLY STAND BY WHILE COMPANIES DEPRIVE MILLIONS OF WORKERS OF THE LABOR LAW PROTECTIONS THEIR RIGHTFULLY ENTITLED. TO OUR STATE LEGISLATURE IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN ESTABLISHING THE COUNTRY STRONG AS WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. HIVE MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAID SICK DAYS PAID FAMILY LEAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION. BUT IF COMPANIES CONVEY THEIR OBLIGATION IS EMPLOYERS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE THEN THESE LAWS BECOME WORTHLESS. COMPANIES THAT USE MISS CLASSIFICATION TO GAME THE SYSTEM ALSO PASS ON ALL OF THEIR TAX OBLIGATION BOTH HALVES THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY PAID BY EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES GO TO THE WORKER. THESE COMPANIES CALL THE WORKERS SMALL BUSINESSES YEAH CONTINUE TO SET WORKERS RATES DIRECT HOW THE WORKER MUST DO THEIR JOB AND IMPOSE DISCIPLINE EVEN WHILE THE WORKER IS DOING THE MAIN WORK OF THE BUSINESS. CALIFORNIA CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ARE. HIS OFFICE ESTIMATES IS SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL TAX REVENUE BECAUSE COMPANIES FORCE WORKERS INTO LIVING WITH SUBSTANDARD WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND DON'T EXPLAIN THEIR TAX LIABILITIES. THE STATE CANNOT ALLOW FREE WRITING BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE PASS OFF THEIR OWN BUSINESS COST ON TO TAXPAYERS AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES. AB FIVE CODIFIES AN ABC TEST AS PRESCRIBED IN DYNAMAX RULING. TEST OUR STANDARDS FOR TRULY INDEPENDENT -- ENTITY. AB FIVE PROVIDES A UNIFORM DEFINITION FOR THE STATE'S WAGE ORDERS AND LABOR CODE WHERE ANOTHER DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE IS NOT PROVIDED I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE SPEAKING TO WORKERS FROM A VARIETY OF FIELDS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE FROM FREELANCE JOURNALIST A TRUCK DRIVERS TO HEAR SALAS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE CONVERSATIONS. SOME WORK HAS BEEN -- CLEARLY DEFINED IN THIS BILL ALREADY AND SOME WORK HAS BEEN. EXEMPTED WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE WILLING TO CONTINUE MAKE CHANGES AS WE FIND THAT MORE CLARITY IS NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I'M COMMITTED A STRIKING A BALANCE SO WE CAN EXTEND CRITICAL EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS TO MORE WORKERS WILL SEPARATE OUT GROUPS THAT GENERALLY FUNCTION AS SMALL BUSINESSES. I'M ALL FOR AN ECONOMY THAT ENCOURAGES INNOVATION BUT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE ABOUT UNDER PAIN SOMEONE FOR THEIR LABOR ARE BASED ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL ON MISS CLASSIFYING WORKERS. A TRULY STRONG ECONOMY MESS INCLUDE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL EMPLOYERS TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR FAIR SHARE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR BUSINESS POSSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL. INSTEAD OF USING UNLAWFUL PRACTICES TO CUT COSTS IN AND YOUR MIND FAIR COMPETITION. WE'RE OFFERING AN ECONOMY WORK INCOME INEQUALITY IS GROWING AND WORKERS TOO OFTEN LACK THE BARGAINING POWER TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITIONS. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT CLEAR. EVERY WORKING CALIFORNIANS EVERY SINGLE WORKING CALIFORNIAN DESERVES BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN THEY GET INJURED ON THE JOB. AND SHOULD NOT BE STARTING GO FUND ME PAGE IS TO FINANCE THEIR MEDICAL BILLS. TODAY WE ARE DETERMINE THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA WORKERS WE CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO BE COMPLICIT IN THE EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS OR WE CAN CHOOSE TO REBUILD THE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE. I HAVE A HOST OF FOLKS WITH ME TODAY ADD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THE COMBINED FOR SIX MINUTES. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AS WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES WE BELIEVE THAT THE DYNAMAX RULING OFFERS AS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING MILLIONS OF WORKERS INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND OUT OF POVERTY. IT ESTABLISHES THAT EVERY WORKER THAT DOES THE REGULAR WORK OF THE BUSINESS SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE MINIMUM WAGE -- AND THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL PROTECTION. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH AB FIVE DOES NOT MAKE A. B. C. TEST THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT'S ALREADY THE CASE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. ESTABLISHED THAT TEST IN THEIR UNANIMOUS DECISION THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT CLARIFYING THE LAW. SAYING WHO IT APPLIES TO SAYING -- WHERE IT NEED NOT APPLY? AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT THIS WILL HELP US IMPLEMENT THE TEST THIS WILL HELP US HAVE ONE CLEAR DEFINITION FOR WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS. ON AND WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- WE HAVE AGREED TO A COUPLE OF EXEMPTIONS ON END THE GOAL OF THOSE THAT HAVE GONE THAT ARE IN PRINT NOW IS REALLY TO SHOW THAT THERE SHOULD BE A HIGH BAR. IF YOU ARE SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE WORK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO MEET A HIGH STANDARD THOSE SHOULD BE WORKERS WHO ARE BEING EXPLOITED WHO ARE MAKING A DECENT WAGE. WHO HAVE SOME POWER OVER THEIR LIVES IN OVER THEIR JOB TIMES BUT WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THESE PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT KINDS OF EXEMPTIONS ARE AS WELL AS TO ADDRESS. LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTING WHICH IS A NORMAL PART OF A HOW BUSINESSES WORK AND WITH THAT I AM I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CARMEL FOSTER WE'RE VERY. PLEASED THAT SHE'S BEEN ABLE TO JOIN US TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AS A DOMESTIC WORKER GEEK WORKER AND A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC WORKERS ALLIANCE. WHICH IS THE NATION'S LEADING VOICE FOR DIGNITY AND FAIRNESS FOR THE MILLIONS OF DOMESTIC WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS COME OUT ORCE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE DOMESTIC WORKER INDUSTRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS A HOUSE CLEANER AND AM CURRENTLY I PERSONAL CARE GIVER FOR THE ELDERLY. AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA LIFE BOAT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. INSERT AFRICA I WAS A MEMBER OF THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS WAY WE WORKED AGGRESSIVELY TO WIN POLICY REFORMS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS. IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND MOSTLY IMMIGRANTS WOMEN AND MEN. OF COLOR WILL WORK AS HOUSE CLEANERS NANNIES AND IN HOME CARE PROVIDERS IN PRIVATE HOMES. NEARLY TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA RELY ON DOMESTIC WORKERS. IN LIGHT OF A HE'S THREE OFF EXCLUSION FROM BASICALLY. PROTECTIONS DOMESTIC WORKERS HAVE. EDUCATOR FOR OVER A DECADE TO AFFIRM THE DIGNITY. OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL. AND TO AND SECURE BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS MOST RECENTLY DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE EXTENDED. THE PERMANENT RIGHTS TO OVERTIME PAY THROUGH SB ONE A ONE FIVE THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS. DESPITE THE GAINS WE'VE MADE. WE ARE STILL INDEED EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE. I WORK IS STILL CONSIDERED INFERIOR EVEN WHILE I WORK IS MOVING ONLINE AND NOW ON THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THE GIG ECONOMY. S. DOMESTIC WORKERS WE ARE FORCED TO ACCEPT. THESE KINDS OF JOBS. AND MORE. ARE MORE PRODUCT PLATFORM SUCH AS HANDY [inaudible] WHICH CONNECT. TO PROFESSIONAL HOUSE CLEANERS. AND MOVING INTO THE DOMESTIC WORKER INDUSTRY. IT HAS PROVEN TO BE THE BEST AND WORST DEVELOPMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I DECIDED TO SIGN UP WITH HANDY AND WAS HOPEFUL. THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE. IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I HAD MANY CHALLENGES. SOON I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE BASIC WORKPLACE AND LABOR PROTECTIONS. SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME MEAL AND REST BREAKS AND TRAVEL TIME COMPENSATION. LIKE OTHER DOMESTIC WORKERS. WHO DON'T TO WORK THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORM COMPANIES INCLUDING THAT RIGHT? THERE TO WERE GAINED ON THE DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS. THERE WAS NO TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW MY PAY WAS ACTUALLY CALCULATOR AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE COMPANY'S RATING POLICIES WHICH ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO HOW HANDY. WORKERS WAGES ARE DETERMINED. FOR EXAMPLE IF I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE WORK REQUESTED ENOUGH HOURS I WAS PAID. FOR THIS RESULTED IN CUSTOMERS RATING ME POORLY. WHICH AFFECTED MY HOURLY RATE AND ABILITY TO ON CONSISTENT RAGE. WHEN I DID GET A NEGATIVE CUSTOMER REVIEW HANDY WOULD NOT DISCLOSE THE ACTUAL PROBLEM OR CLIENT WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT? SO IT COULD BE RESOLVED WHICH AFFECTED MY ABILITY TO GET MORE WORK BECAUSE THEY CONTROL WHAT JOBS ARE AVAILABLE TO HANDY WORKERS. BASED ON CUSTOMER RATINGS HOWEVER WORKERS AREN'T ABLE TO DISPUTE THE RATINGS ON THE WAGES WE AS A RESULT I DIDN'T GET FAYE AND LOVABLE WAGES BECAUSE MY RATES DID NOT INCREASE. SOON I STARTED GETTING MORE FEES IMPOSED DENNIS MY RATINGS DROP MY PAY RATE DROPPED. EVEN LOWER HANDED FEES ARBITRARY AND PUNITIVE AGAINST THE WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE DAVIS TIMES MY FEES WERE MORE THAN WHAT I WAS GOING TO OUR OWN. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENED I HAD TO WORK ON A PLOT PLATFORM. FOR FREE IN ORDER TO PAY. THE FEES I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS A FORM OF WAGE THEIR THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSONAL TESTIMONY -- WE HAVE A LOT ALL THE TIME IF IF FOLKS WANT TO STATE THEIR POSITION -- PLEASE DO SO.

LIKE GREAT. FROM TWENTY TWO YEARS AND I POSE THIS THIS BETTER TAKE MY MY FOOD AND MY INDEPENDENT URGING ALL BLOCKING ABILITY. SO I AFFORD THIS STRONGLY AND I WANT TO REMAIN THE SAME AS I AM BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY -- THANK YOU EVERYONE -- BUT THAT'S TAKEN THE TIME TO BE A PUBLIC COMMENT AS WE GET BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IN ORDER MOTION [inaudible] OKAY ANY. COMMENT ON IT. THANK YOU YES THE CHECKS -- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL UP TO COMMITTEE -- I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE -- VERY RECENT STORY FROM A CONSTITUENT OF MINE HIS NAME IS ROBERT HE DRIVES FOR LEFT. HE WAS ALSO A CONTRACTED WORKER WITH FED EX OR THE UNIFORM DROVE THE TRUCK DID NOT HAVE THE BENEFITS THE NOT GET PAID OVERTIME. THIS IS ALL. A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION THE RECENTLY HAPPENED HAPPENS BECAUSE I NEEDED A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT TO COME TO WORK. AND SO CAN THE CONSTITUENT LIVES IN MY SAME NEIGHBORHOOD I ASKED HIM HEY HOW DO YOU LIKE DRIVING FOR LIFT. SAYS WELL I STARTED DRIVING FOR LIFT BECAUSE I HAD THIS OTHER JOB WHERE I WAS AND HIRE FULL TIME HE WAS DRIVING AROUND OUR DISTRICT WHICH IS MOSTLY HILLS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE -- HIS DELIVERIES ON TIME. AND SO HE WAS GETTING DOT BY HIS CONTRACTED EMPLOYER. AND HE WOULD STAY EXTRA TO MAKE HIS DELIVERIES WITHOUT GETTING PAID OVERTIME AND I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM. IF SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM ON THE JOB WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS WORKERS COMPENSATION. NO ANSWER TO THAT. HE SAID HE FELT JILTED HE WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING. AND SO HE STARTED WORKING FOR LEFT AND HE LIKED THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HOURS HE LIKED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE HIS OWN SCHEDULE. UNTIL HE HAD AN INCIDENT IN WHICH HE GOT A OF YOU KNOW WENT TO GO PICK SOMEBODY UP A WOMAN AT A BAR THE COPS WERE THERE THERE HAVE BEEN A FIGHT. THINGS HAPPEN THAT BARS -- THE WOMAN UNFORTUNATELY HAVE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK GOT IN THE CAR HE FELT AS HUMAN BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR HER. HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE WHO'S INEBRIATED IN THAT STATE? TOOK HER TO HER DESTINATION. MUCH IS VERY ANGRY AND ASSAULTED HIM. STARTED HITTING HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GOT TO HER PLACE SAFE -- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SITUATION FOR HER HAD BEEN SOMEONE ELSE WITH LESS. MORALS -- LIFT APPARENTLY HAS -- AN EMERGENCY NUMBER THAT YOU CALL AS A DRIVER AND HE CALLED IT TO FILE. WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM? AND NO ONE PICKED UP. THERE WASN'T ANYBODY ON THE OTHER END. AND THE ONLY THING THAT HE COULD DO WAS GIVE HER A LOW RATING. AND THEN WRITE A COMMENT. THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR RIDE. HE DID GET A CALL BACK UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY HOURS LATER. IN WHICH HE SHARED THAT -- THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE SAID WELL ARE YOU OKAY. HE SAID YOUNG FINE BUT THAT'S NOT. WHY I'M CALLING OUR WAY CALLED? AND THAT HE FELT INCREDIBLY ALONE. WHAT IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN? WHAT IF IT WOULD HAVE GONE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION? WHAT WERE HIS RIGHTS AS A WORKER? AND SO I TOLD THEM -- WE'RE DOING THIS SMALL LITTLE THING CALLED AB -- FIVE AND HE SAID I WANT TO KNOW MORE. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A JOB THAT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M ABLE TO PAY MY RENT TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE BUT I ALSO WANT TO FEEL SAFE. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS YES THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULES OR IS IT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO BE SAID ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN SCHEDULE. DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU NEED TO DO IN YOUR LIFE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM FIVE YEARS AGO SO WE ARE IN A NEW AGE A NEW ECONOMY. IN WHICH WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO DEFINE WHAT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS ARE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOPEFULLY SET A TONE FOR THE NATION BECAUSE SURE. WE LOVE INNOVATION WE WANT TO USE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT TO USE THESE APPS THAT MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE AT THE COST AND WELL BEING OF WORKERS WHO DESERVE TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE TO HAVE BENEFITS TO HAVE A RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION IF THAT'S WHAT THEY SO CHOOSE TO DO. BUT ALSO SHOULDN'T FEEL DISCRIMINATED IF THEY ARE WORKING IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THEY KNOW THAT OTHER WORKERS ARE FULLY EMPLOYED WITH BENEFITS WHILE THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS IT CREATES A DIVISION. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT TESTIMONY ON HIS BEHALF BECAUSE IT COMES DIRECTLY FROM MY DISTRICT. AND IT SHOWED ME THE REAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT IT TRULY MEANS AND WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO AND LIVE HIS LIFE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT IS A QUESTION OF FOR THE AUTHOR AND YOUR YOUR WITNESS -- COULD CERTAINLY ANSWER I IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY -- I THINK THAT THERE IS OFTENTIMES MENTIONED THAT BUT THIS BILL FLEXIBILITY IS LOST OR STATUS CHANGES BOX BUT HE CAN YOU ANSWER A TO THAT. FLEXIBILITY IS A 100% AND THE CONTROL OF THE EMPLOYER -- AND SO WHETHER AN EMPLOYER CHOOSES TO ALLOW WORKERS FLEXIBILITY -- AS LIFTING OVER CURRENTLY DO ARE ON ON THEIR PLATFORMS WOULD BE THE SAME IF THEY WERE EMPLOYEES THE WORKERS THEMSELVES IT WOULD BE UP TO UBER OR LEFT -- TO TO DECIDE IF THEY GAVE WORKERS THAT FLEXIBILITY OR NOT -- THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE OF COURSE THOSE WORKERS COULD COME TOGETHER -- AND AND I HAVE A COLLECTIVE VOICE. WITH THEIR EMPLOYER ABOUT THAT DESIRE FOR FLEXIBILITY SOMETHING THAT RIGHT NOW IS IS. ALTHOUGH HAPPENS. AND OFFICIALLY IT IS REALLY BARRED BY FEDERAL LAW. OF AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AYE AYE A EVERYBODY THAT SAYS THEY WANT FLEXIBILITY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. IN THE HANDS OF OF LIFT AND UBER AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FLEXIBILITY. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LABOR CODE OR AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIPS -- THAT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN EMPLOYER IS FLEXIBLE IN THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT THIS PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON BEHALF OF MY OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT WAS SITTING UP HERE EARLIER AND DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO TESTIFY -- HE SPOKE ABOUT HIS OWN LIMOUSINE SERVICE COMPANY AND SAID THEY HAVE THE EMPLOYMENT MODEL THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO DECLINE JOBS THAT'S PART OF THE WAY THEY RUN THAT BUSINESS IT IS AN ON DEMAND BUSINESS. AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE DRIVERS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE DRIVERS WILLING TO KIND OF GO WITH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF THE WORK AND SO THERE'S NO REASON AN EMPLOYER. CAN'T OFFER AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS THEY WANT AND IN FACT MANY MANY EMPLOYERS CHOOSE TO DO THAT WHILE STILL PROVIDING THAT SAFETY THAT FOR THEIR WORK AND I DIDN'T HINDER HIS ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF OPENING LIMOUSINE SERVICE. AND QUITE FRANKLY -- TO LET LET'S POINT OUT THAT -- THERE IS FLEXIBILITY NOW BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE ON THE FLEXIBILITY ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT A RIDE THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY WERE AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER. PEOPLE WOULD BE TO RIDE AND IF THAT WAS AVAILABLE THAT THEY PLOY E. COULD WORK -- IF NOBODY WANTED TO RIDE WITH IN THIS PLATFORM THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN'T WORK IF NOBODY NEEDS A RIDE LIKE WISE THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU UP I HAVE SOME COMMENTS I WANT TO GIVE LIFE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY IF THEY DO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY WELL I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR BUT I ALSO WANT. TO THANK EVERYONE THAT WAS HERE BOTH SUPPORT SUPPORT WITH THE MAN OPPOSITION. THERE'S BEEN A LOT. UNDERSTANDABLY CONVERSATION MEETINGS AND THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE. ON THIS ISSUE -- AS INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS IN -- THE STAFF ANALYSIS UP THIS BILL IS CAUGHT UP BY EXISTING LAW BASED UPON THE SUPREME COURT DECISION. IF NOTHING IS DONE THAT IS THE LAW AND IT STANDS. AND SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S GREAT INTEREST FROM EMPLOYERS FROM FOLKS WILL WORK IS IN A CONTACT AS FOR BUT WORKERS -- IN THIS BILL BECAUSE OF WHAT IT. DOES OR DOESN'T DO. BUT JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR IF NOTHING HAPPENS THE STATE OF THE LAW. AS AS A RULED UPON AND ACTUALLY SUBSTANTIATED IN SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION AND RULINGS FROM COURSE THAT ARE ALREADY USING DYNAMAX AS PRESIDENT. THAT ABC TEST IS LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IS NOT JUST DEALING WITH THIS CLASSIFICATION IS ALSO TOOK TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE. TO TAKE A POSITION AS TO HOW THE COURT RULING SHOULD BE APPLIED IN A WAY THAT MAKES pAND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT OF THE DIALOGUE CONTINUE. FROM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS OF I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE WITH DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES -- CERTAINLY MY OFFICE AND I I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LABOR COMMITTEE -- AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- THAT THIS FIRST GO AROUND INCLUDES AMENDMENTS THAT EXEMPTS CERTAIN INDUSTRIES BASED UPON A LOT OF MEETINGS A LOT OF CONVERSATION. A LOT OF DIALOGUE -- AND THAT THE THESE MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS AREN'T GONNA STOP GOING FORWARD -- THAT BEING SAID IT IS THE POSITION OF OF OF OF THE THE UNDERLYING POSITION. OF CERTAINLY. MYSELF AS LABOR CHAIR AND I BELIEVE AS THE AUTHOR IS THAT THE DYNAMIC RULING WAS A CORRECT RULING. IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE THAT IT WAS SENDING. AFTER YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND DECADES OF MISS CLASSIFICATION. THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE STILL MORE AMENDMENTS TO COM MORE CONVERSATION TO COME AND SO I'M REALLY REALLY GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS. THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S GONNA REQUIRE FAR MORE DIALOGUE GOING FORWARD WE HEARD IT FROM INDUSTRIES I HAVE CONTINUED CONCERNS BUT ALL THE EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR THE MANY MANY HOURS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPENT -- BOTH WORKING OUTSIDE THE BUILDING WITH WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WITH LABOR WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT I THINK EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH OUR AUTHOR WITH A SUMMARY GONZALEZ WITH -- OUR COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO REALLY THANK A MEGAN THAT LANE OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT WHO HAS SPENT MANY MANY HOURS NOT JUST WRITING ANALYSIS BUT IN MEETINGS. GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS WORKING WITH LABOR WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS WORKED WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE PROPER INFORMATION SO THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE. AND SO I'M VERY ENCOURAGE OF WHERE WE ARE IN A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING -- IN THIS PROCESS AND SO WE KNOW THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED ISSUE ESPECIALLY AS IT APPLIES TO THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS NOT ONE THING. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED WE'RE REALIZING THAT WERE LEARNING THAT AND SO I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE -- TO SEE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY -- OF FOR A MORE AMENDMENTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE BUT I WILL SAY THIS. IF THE BILL DOES REACH THE GOVERNOR'S THAT'S THE STOCK IN A SATISFY EVERYONE'S NEEDS -- THAT'S FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH UNDERLYING DECISION OF DYNAMICS AND SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET. FAIRLY AND THAT PEOPLE. HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CASE IN ITSELF DOES PROTECT WORKERS THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATURE -- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I THINK THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE OUR DOOR OPEN. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT ALL FLEXIBILITY IS ALLOWED WITH ALL THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE AFFECTED. AND SO I KNOW THAT'S WHAT HOW HARD THAT THAT THE THE AUTHORS OF WORKING ON IN THAT DIRECTION -- AND WILL CONTINUE AS A LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT THE AUTHOR AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT -- COMMUNICATION CONTINUES AND SO WITH THAT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THIS IS IT AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGING UNDERTAKING NO ONE HAD TO BRING THIS BILL OR DEAL WITH THIS. THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR THAT ALREADY HAS SHOWN FLEXIBILITY BY ALLOWING THE HAVE BY HAVING AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE CONTINUE TO WORK GOING FORWARD I THINK INDICATES THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR AUTHOR IS WILLING TO WORK. WITH OPPOSITION WITH THE SUPPORT WITH THE MEN'S AND WITH EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE -- BUT THEY HAVE A BROKEN ARM OR NOT THAT SHOWS UP TO THE TO TESTIFY OR TO SHOW SUPPORT. SO THANK YOU A SUMMER GONZALEZ AND YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU FOR THAT ROB OF I THINK YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY. FOR THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED TODAY I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THEM WHO CAME FORWARD. AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS SO I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST WITH PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES I THINK -- AND ORGANIZATIONS. MAYBE THERE'S GET SOMETHING LOST IN THE TRANSLATION WHEN WHEN WHEN ORGANIZATIONS ARE TELLING THE WORKERS -- WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING OR WHAT THEY SHOULD BE THINKING OR WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND I KEPT HEARING A FEW THINGS TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS -- NOBODY IS TAKING PART BE OUT SO PART B. IS ESSENTIAL TO THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND IT IS IT IS. THAT THE MIDDLE PART OF A TEST SO -- SO IT TO BELIEVE AT LEAST IN THIS BILL. THE ONE I'M CARING AND PART B. WILL NOT BE TAKEN OUT SO I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT EVEN IN NEGOTIATED STANDPOINT WHAT WE'VE DONE ON EXEMPTIONS IS THIS. WE'VE TAKEN WORKERS WHO FIRST OF ALL HISTORICALLY HISTORICALLY HAD CERTAIN ASPECTS THAT MADE THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO ORDER% IN THE LABOR CODE. THINGS LIKE THE BILL EIGHTY TO SOUTH NEGOTIATE RIGHT THERE SETTING THEIR OWN RATES THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STRUCTURE -- THEY THEY ARE WORKERS FIND FAR THAT SATISFY OUR TEST FOR FOR SALARIED EXEMPTS. WORKERS IN OTHER WORDS IT THEIR THEIR SALARY IS IS AT LEAST TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE ME WE'RE NOT WORRIED IF AS MUCH ABOUT OVER TIME. AND AND REST PERIODS AND BREAK PERIODS THEY HAVE ALL THE SHARE THESE FEATURES -- THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR THEMSELVES THEIR RATES ARE NOT FAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- WHEN RATES ARE SET BY A MASTER CONTRACTOR THAT MEANS YOU'RE WORKING FOR SOMEBODY -- FOR THE MOST PART IN AND ALL ALL JUST AND I'M STE I'M SORRY I I REALLY WANT TO TALK TO ALL THE WORKERS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS UNDERSTOOD. FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD LOOK AT COSMETOLOGY AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING. TO WORK ON IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WITH -- HAIR STYLISTS IN AND NAIL SALON OWNERS AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND WE ALL KNOW THIS IF YOU GO TO YOUR YOUR YOUR HAIR STYLIST IN YOURTHEIR BOOKING YOUR APPOINTMENT THE RENTING A CHAIR. THEY'RE SETTING THE RATES THERE'S NOT RATES ON THE ON ON THE WALL THAT TELL YOU HOW MUCH THEY'RE CHARGING THAT MEANS ARE WORKING FOR THEMSELVES VERY SMALL BUSINESS THEY'RE NEGOTIATING WITH YOU. IF I'M WORKING FOR A COMPANY WHERE EVERY HAIR CUT IS SEVEN DOLLARS AND THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SOUTH DECIDED AND THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDING WHEN I AM I'M GOING TO SCHEDULE YOU AND HOW OFTEN I'M THERE. THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THAT DOESN'T FOUNDER FEEL LIKE A SMALL BUSINESS AND I I WANT PEOPLE TO REALLY THINK THROUGH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS UNDERSTAND IN KNOLL NOT JUST THAT THEY HAVE FLEXIBILITY BUT THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER -- THEIR WORKPLACE AND HOW MUCH. FRANKLY THEY MAKE IDEAL FLEXIBILITY AND AND LIVE DRIVERS AND I NOW LIVE DOES A GOOD JOB OF OF WITH SOME DRIVERS OF BRINGING THEM HERE -- YOU KNOW I ALSO HAD A STORY AND I'M START TAKING TOO MUCH TIME BUT THIS IS FOR ME SUCH AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE. I WAS IN THAT THE CHAIRS I DISTRICT ON FRIDAY. AND AND I I TOOK AN UBER. OF A DRIVER WHO ALSO DROVE FOR LEFT IN AS I DO EVERY TIME I ASK ABOUT ABOUT THEIR SITUATION AND AND HOW THEY WORK -- AND HE WAS A SINGLE DAD HE HAD FOUR KIDS AND HE SAID THAT HE STARTED DRIVING. AT TO SUPPLEMENT A PART TIME JOB IN AT FIRST WHEN IT FIRST CAME OF THIS WAS FIVE SIX YEARS AGO HE WAS ACTUALLY MAKING REALLY GOOD MONEY HE SAID -- IN THE SAN JOSE AREA YOU KNOW IF YOU WORKED IF YOU WORK AS A DRIVER FOR SIXTY HOURS A WEEK WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK -- THAT HE COULD OF MAKEUP CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK AND HE COULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GET BY IN AN BILL TAKE CARE OF HIS FOUR KIDS -- HE SAID OVER THE TIME PERIOD WHAT HE SAW IS THAT ABILITY TO MAKE THAT MONEY WENT DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. AS THESE TWO COMPANIES BATTLED AND THAT HE IS NOW -- BRINGING HOME ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK WORKING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK AND SAN JOSE WHICH IS HIGH A COST LIVING. BEFORE TAXES AND THEN HE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY HIS TAXES HE HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE IT IS CHILDREN ARE NOT INSURED -- HE HE HAS NO SAFETY NET IF HE GETS HURT ON THE JOB HE DOESN'T HAVE WORKERS COMPENSATION HE HAS NO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT IF SOMEHOW HE HE LOSES THAT JOB. AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE FEAR THE FEAR OF OF UBER OR LIFT OR ANY TECH COMPANY AFTER BASED COMPANY OF OF RETALIATING AGAINST HIS ABILITY TO EARN MONEY THROUGH THAT PLATFORM WITHOUT EXPLANATION. THEY CAN DROP A DRIVER WITHOUT EXPLANATION IN WHICH CASE HE IS STILL A FATHER OF FOUR KIDS. LIVING IN SAN JOSE WITHOUT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WITHOUT HIS ABILITY TO EVEN MAKE A CAR PAYMENT. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- YOU KNOW IT WE SAW A LOT OF CELEBRATIONS ON FRIDAY BECAUSE IT THE DAY THIS MAN TOLD METHE STORY. THE DAY THE MAN TOLD ME THE STORY WAS THE SAME DATE WE SAW LIVE CELEBRATE BECOMING. AT A COMPANY VALUED AT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS BILLION WITH A B.. THAT HIGH THAT'S A INNOVATION THAT'S GREAT BUT IF YOU'RE A TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY IN YOU GET ON TELEVISION AND SAY IF YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE AND PROVIDE WORKERS COMPENSATION. AND IN OVERTIME AND IN PAID SICK LEAVE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE IF YOU HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS THAT EVERY OTHER COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO DO. THAT YOU CANNOT SURVIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THIS IS NOT HOW CAPITALISM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. THAT IS THEN EITHER FAKE VALUE OF A COMPANY AND MEANS A LOT OF PEOPLE GET RIPPED OFF WITH STOCK OR THEY HAVE A REALLY BAD BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN PLAY THEIR WORKERS BUT SOMEHOW THEY CAN PAY. THEIR STOCKHOLDERS -- WHO WHO BASICALLY ARE INVESTING IN A COMPANY THAT THEY SAY THEY SAY THEY CREATED THE VALUE IS TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS I AT COMPANY? THE SAME WEEK THAT WORKERS HAD TO GO ON STRIKE BECAUSE THEIR PER MILEAGE FEE WAS BEING CUT. AN INVESTOR WAS CELEBRATING HIS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT BECAME A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE DAY. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WAY WE HAVE ALLOWED THESE COMPANIES TO OPERATE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO PAY ARE YOU IN ME THE PEOPLE THAT PAY ARE GOOD COMPANIES LIKE OUR REMOTE SERVICES THAT PAY EITHER DRIVERS CORRECTLY AS EMPLOYEES. US AS TAXPAYERS LAST YEAR WE WE SUPPLEMENTED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT MEANS THAT FATHER FOR IS GOING TO GET A TAX CREDIT. PAID BY TAXPAYERS [inaudible] WELL LET'S. YOU KNOW CELEBRATES THEIR THEIR HUGE GAINS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING RICH AND IT'S NOT THE WORKERS IN ITS APLIKASI OF THE TAXPAYERS IT'S TIME TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. IT'S TIME TO BE HONEST WITH WORKERS IT'S TIME TO BE HONEST I'M WITH COMPANIES AND LET US WORK ON THE SAME. IDEAS TOGETHER IN UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE SO I THANK YOU FOR LETTING. ME SAY THAT I KNOW THAT WAS OFF SCRIPT BUT OKAY. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY APPS FOR NINE THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. UNLESS AMERICA REAL SECOND BY SUMMER EVERY BUS. HAS ACCURATE CALL THE ROLL. THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. LARA NOT VOTING CARILLO. CARILLO I DEEP. GONZALEZ HI AND SALAS I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER A THREE OF US. THREE OF US I A BILLS OUT BUT THAT DOES UP THANK YOU. AND SO WE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A SENSITIVE. WITNESSES WERE GONNA ASK IF WE GOT AYE GREGORY IT'S IT IS A BILL WITH NO OPPOSITION. AND I BELIEVE THE SUBSEQUENT AUTHOR HAS SOMETIMES LIMITATIONS OF WE CAN [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY SO AB -- TWELVE TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. THERE IS A AND I RECOMMEND STATION DO PASSED TO INSURANCE ANIMAL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THE BILL -- UNDER CURRENT LAW LIVING ORGAN DONORS ARE ALLOWED UP TO THIRTY DAYS OF PAID LEAVE AFTER SURGERY YOU'RE FULLY RECOVER. AB TWO TWELVE TWENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL UNPAID LEAVE OF UP TO THIRTY BUSINESS DAYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ORGAN DONATION ONCE ALL AVAILABLE. SIX LEAVE HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- MY WITNESSES -- MELANIE CON DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND AND DARIUS BROWN A LIVING DONOR KIDNEY RECIPIENT THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN KALRA CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIRMAN FLOOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE TODAY A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION. BASED ON A PERSON'S STATUS AS A LIVING ORGAN DONOR AND THAT WOULD ENSURE ACCESS TO JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR ORGAN DONATION. MY NAME IS MELANIE CON I AM THE DIRECTOR OF STATE AFFAIRS FOR THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN WERE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN ROCKVILLE MARYLAND THAT FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS HAS HELP PEOPLE FIGHT KIDNEY DISEASE. KIDNEY TRANSPLANT ACTS AS A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY FAILURE. OFFERING THE CHANCE FOR A LONGER AND HEALTHIER LIFE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE SEVERE SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE ORGANS FROM DECEASED DONORS IN THE UNITED STATES MEANS THAT MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO DIE. IN ORDER TO GET A KIDNEY UNLESS THEY CAN FIND A LIVING ORGAN DONOR. UNFORTUNATELY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WHO DONATE ORGANS EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE COMPANIES SOLELY BASED ON THEIR STATUS AS AN ORGAN DONOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN AND I. H. STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF KIDNEY DONORS HAD DIFFICULTY CHANGING OR INITIATING INSURANCE. PARTICULARLY LIFE INSURANCE THAT STUDY CONCLUDED AND I'M QUOTING DIRECTLY FROM THE STUDY NOW THESE PRACTICES BY INSURERS CREATE UNNECESSARY BURDENS AND STRESS FOR THE CHEAP THOSE CHOOSING TO DONATE. AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIVE KIDNEY DONATION AMONG THOSE CONSIDERING TOWARD DONATION. FURTHER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH FROM JOHNS HOPKINS HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PEOPLE WHO DONATE A KIDNEY ARE JUST AS LIKELY TO LIVE JUST AS LONG AND LEAD JUSTICE HEALTHY HEALTHY LIVES AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH OF THEIR ORGANS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROHIBITING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ORGAN DONORS. AND GUARANTEEING JOB SECURITY WHEN THEY TAKE TIME OFF TO RECOVER FROM ORGAN DONATION SURGERY ARE NOT ONLY SENSIBLE PROTECTIONS BURKE FRANKLY JUST GOOD POLICY. AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE INCUR THE PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY THANK YOU. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON AB. TWELVE TWENTY THREE THE BILL THE PROTECTED LIVING ORGAN DONORS FROM INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION AND ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME OFF FROM WORK TO RECOVER FROM DONATION SURGERY. MY NAME IS DARIUS BROWN. AND AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IN RECENT RECIPIENT OF A KIDNEY FROM A LIVING DONOR I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. MY JOURNEY WITH KIDNEY DISEASE STARTED WHEN I WAS A SEVEN YEAR OLD. WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THE MARIJUANA FRIDAYS? THAT DIAGNOSIS EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED INTO FOCAL SEGMENTAL AMEREN OF FRIDAY'S BY THE TIME I WAS IN MY EARLY THIRTIES WHICH REQUIRED ME TO GO ON DIALYSIS. I DI LIES THAT NIGHT FOR ABOUT EIGHT HOURS IN EIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHICH ALLOWED ME TO CONTINUE WORKING FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT MY JOB AS A SERVICE TECHNICIAN I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY BECAUSE I CONTINUE WORKING WHILE ON DIALYSIS BUT IT WAS A DAILY CHALLENGE. DIALYSIS TREATMENTS ALONE IS IT. IS A PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING IN FULL TIME COMMITMENT AND MANY PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY DISEASE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MY WIFE AND I HOSTED A SMALL NEW YEAR'S EVE DINNER AT OUR HOME AND A FAMILY FRIEND OF OURS CONFIDED TO MY WIFE THAT SHE WANTED TO HELP ME. FIGHT WITH KIDNEY DISEASE HE OFFERED TO GET TESTED. TO SEE IF SHE WAS A DONOR MATCH AND SHE WAS ON NOVEMBER SECOND TWENTY EIGHTEEN I RECEIVED MY KIDNEY TRANSPLANT. AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THE BETTER. I NO LONGER HAVE TO DIE ALLIES WHICH MEANS I HAVE THE GIFT OF TIME IN FACT I'M STILL GETTING USED TO HAVING THAT TIME BACK. WHICH IS A GOOD THING TO DO IT. I HAVE MORE TIME TO DO THINGS WITH MY FAMILY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TRAVELING MORE NO LONGER BEING ON DIALYSIS ALSO MEANS FEWER DIETARY ESTRICTIONS. AND WHILE I MANY THIS MAY SEEM TRIVIAL. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I EVER DID AFTER MY SURGERY WAS. I WAS ABLE. TO EAT A BOWL OF CEREAL WITH REAL MILK WHICH IS SOMETHING I WASN'T ABLE TO DO BEFORE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I TAKEN YOU KNOW MANY TAKE FOR GRANTED. THE FRIEND WHO DONATED THE KIDNEY TO ME GAVE ME A CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE SHE AND OTHER LIVING DONORS. ARE GENEROUS PEOPLE WHO SELFLESSLY CHOOSE TO HELP SOMEONE IN NEED. AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS FOR THEM AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO ALSO BECOME LIVING DONORS THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SHOULD PASS THIS BILL.

ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF ELIMINATING HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. GIVEN FIRST OF ALL THAT IT CREATES AN INCONSISTENT DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE -- THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL ARE AMENDING THE SAME LABOR CODE PROVISION THAT DISCUSSES HER SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING HOWEVER. SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURS OFTEN TIME IN THE WORKPLACE -- AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE POLICE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED. BY THE CRIMINAL DEPARTMENT IT IS DETERMINED BY AN INVESTIGATION DONE BY THE EMPLOYER IT'S DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OR TO TERMS AND QUIRK WHETHER SEXUAL HARASSMENT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BEHAVIOR THAT CAN BE INAPPROPRIATE ANY SORT OF HARASSMENT IS OBVIOUSLY -- SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED HOWEVER IT'S NOT ALWAYS UNLAWFUL AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SIMPLY PULLS PARTS OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT COULD RISE TO THE LEVEL SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THEY ACTUALLY WRITES THE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE STANDARD EXAMPLE SHOWING SOMEONE A CARTOON OR LEERING IS INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BUT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT'S UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT CAN. BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT DOES THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW HIM AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE LEAVE FROM WORK FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS BEING CáC CALLED ON THEIR WAY TO WORK GOING INTO THE EMPLOYER SAYING. I'M GOING TO TAKE NEXT WEEK OFF BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I NEED AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME OF LEAVE BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE ANY VERIFICATION BY ANYONE AS LONG AS YOU ARE GIVING PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO YOUR EMPLOYER. YOU GET PRIOR NOTIFICATION YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TAKE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME OFF ADDITIONALLY ALLOWS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO TAKE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME OFF AS WELL. AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS MAY TAKE THIS LEAVE FOR THE SAME REASON AS YOU ALLEGE THAT YOU WERE SEXUALLY HARASSED WITHOUT ANY SORT OF VERIFICATION. THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS EXTREMELY BROAD AND GIVEN THE WAY THAT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT BY EXAMPLE WOULD ALLOW ME TO TELL MY BROTHER WHO MIGHT LIVE IN SAN DIEGO. THAT IKE'S THE I SUFFERED SEXUAL HARASSMENT I WANT YOU TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AS WELL AND ALLOW HIM TO TAKE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF THE FOR SOMETHING AS MINOR. AS A CAT CALL AND THEN FOR I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR HOWEVER THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE BILL'S CURRENT DRAFTED AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS JUST SO DIFFERENT AGAIN IT'S REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. THIS NOW PLACES IT INTO THE LABOR CODE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THAT ISSUE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. WHO HELPED TO WEED OUT CLAIMS THAT ARE FRIVOLOUS AND THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH DEPARTMENT DOING THAT AS FAR AS ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY? AND OUR CONCERNS ARE JUST THE OVERALL ABUSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO VERIFY OR ALLOW ANYONE TO TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BECAUSE WE TOOK THE GAVEL MR HERE WELL I TOOK ABOUT -- I ALSO WANT TO THINK A ASSEMBLYMEMBER ON TENNIS STAFFORD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS LAST YEAR'S IN JUST A FOLLOW UP WITH MISS CURTIS'S COMMENTS WE HAVE SUGGESTED SOME POTENTIAL. AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS REYES FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN THE BROAD DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CONTAINED IN THE TWO PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO TWO THIRTY AND TWO THIRTY POINT. ONE IS FOR EXAMPLE TO UTILIZE THE HARASSMENT DEFINITION OUT OF FEE ON THE GOVERNMENT CODE. IN. ONE TWO NINE FOUR ZERO I ALSO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE ABOUT PROVIDING CERTIFICATION TO THE EMPLOYER. FOR THE FOR ACTS RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS WELL. ANOTHER ITEM IS IS THAT IN. SUB DIVISION E.. THREE IT TALKS ABOUT THE EMPLOYER MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY OF EMPLOYEES REQUESTING LEAVE. OUR CONCERN THERE IS IS THAT WE'RE FACED WITH THE SITUATION UNDER FEE HOT. THAT WERE THERE ARE HARASSMENT CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. INTERVIEW EMPLOYEES DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE THERE'S A TENSION THERE BETWEEN. THE PROVISIONS HERE OF MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY AND FIAT DEMANDING INVESTIGATION. ALSO WITH THESE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR CODE WERE CONCERNED THAT INSTEAD OF BEING THE CURRENT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OF SIX MONTHS CURRENTLY UNDER FREE HOT. THAT IT COULD TURN INTO THREE TO FOUR YEARS NOW THAT THESE WOULD BE ADDED TO THE LABOR CODE. AND IN ADDITION OF COURSE AS WE ALWAYS LIKE TO POINT OUT ARE CONCERNED WITH. ANY ADDITIONAL -- CLAIMS UNDER THE LABOR CODE SUBJECT EMPLOYERS TO ACTIONS UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT SO WITH THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED BUT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED A STAFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY MORE MINUTES LEFT IN THAT. SIX MINUTE LIMIT AB FORTY FIVE SECONDS OKAY SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT FOR THE MANUFACTURERS ARE CONCERNED ARE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE OPPOSITION THIS FAR. BUT MAINLY FOR US THAT THE NO LIMIT ON THE DURATION OR THE FREQUENCY OF THE LEAVE IS GREATLY CONCERNING FOR INDUSTRY BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE GONE OUT ON LEAVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN PROCESS SEES. SO NOT KNOWING WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME OUT AND HELP. GOING TO COME BACK AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUT. IS VERY CONCERNING FOR US SO WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR HOWEVER INDUSTRY -- CONCERNS ADDRESSED BUT FOR NOW WE REMAIN OPPOSED ALONG AS I SAID BEFORE WITH THE OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION PROPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN MEMBERS MATTHEW ALLEN WITH WESTERN GROWERS ARE ALSO OPPOSED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BROWN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND COLLEAGUES AT THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY OPPOSED. THANK YOU. OKAY A BACK TO COMMITTEE -- IS ANY FURTHER COMMENT. I'LL JUST I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE THAT I THINK THAT. SOME OF THE CONCERNS A WARRANT I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THE STAFF NOW SO THERE IS A NEED FOR GREATER CLARITY. AGAIN BEING THE LABOR EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE IS THIS A WORTHY ENDEAVOR YES. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO REALLY FIND TO SOME OF THESE DEFINITIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROCESS AYE THAT'S OF THE AUTHOR -- HAS COMMITTED TO DOING -- IN TERMS OF THE DOING THAT FOR THEIR WORK AND SO I'M I'M CONFIDENT THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND WORK WITH OPPOSITION. AS WELL AS WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF -- TO ENSURE THAT HAPPENS I'LL JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT THOUGH. YOU KNOW THIS IS FOR UNPAID TIME OFF -- FOR VICTIMS OF THOSE ARE SUPPORTING VICTIMS AND I THINK. WE WE I THINK WE HAVE A RECOGNITION BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH. OVER MANY DECADES. THAT WERE FINALLY STARTING TO RECOGNIZE WE DO MORE TO PROTECT VICTIMS [inaudible] AND THE SUGGESTION THAT FOLKS ARE GOING. TO YOU KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR THOUGHTS COLLIDED FORGET CAT CALL TO TAKE TIME OFF I'VE NOT HEARD. OF THIS IS A DISRESPECT TO THE WORKER. AT THAT THOSE THE WORKERS THAT EUROPE HIRING AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK OF THEM THAT I I I I I JUST DON'T BUY IT. I I THINK THAT FOLKS ARE GOING TO CERTAINLY PERSONALLY TO HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IS USED IF IT'S ABUSED THEN WE CERTAINLY. HAVE TO TAKE SUCH GOOD ACTION TO ENSURE THERE IS AN ABUSE BUT I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT SUBSEQUENT. AMENDMENTS WILL HELP TO FINE TUNE IT HELP CLARIFY I DO BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS NEED MORE CLARIFICATION -- AS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THIS -- BONTA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE DOES AN ADEQUATE VERIFICATION PROCESS WE WE'VE -- WE HAVE. ONE IN THE BILL NOW AND IF THE IF THERE ARE AREAS WHERE WE CAN FROM IT UP INCLUDING CLEAR FIGHT WERE HAPPY TO WE ALSO HAVE. A REFERENCE -- TO THE FMLA AROUND THAT THAT THE TIME RESTRICTIONS AND AND IT IT IS SO IT'S NOT DOESN'T CLEARLY STATED ON ITS FACE IN THE BILL BUT IT REFERS THE FMLA WHICH HAS A TWELVE WEEK. LIMIT ON ON HOW MUCH PAID LEAVE CAN BE TAKEN SO TO SAY THE SUGGEST THAT IT'S UNLIMITED IT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE AND IF WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE AS BE ABOUT THE BILL GOIN FORWARD -- WE WE CAN DO THAT. I ALSO THINK THE PUT THIS IN A PARADE OF HORRIBLE IS ABOUT HOW ALL OF THE WORKERS ARE GONNA ABUSE THIS IS JUST NOT WARRANTED. WE TO WE LIKE EVIDENCE BASED TO DATA BASED ARGUMENTS IN IN THIS. BUILDING AND WE HAVE HAD ALREADY HAVE THIS BILL OF THIS LAW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS IT RELATES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STALKING AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXAMPLES OF OF THAT TYPE OF ABUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S AN ONES. IT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN IMAGINED TO AS AN AS AN ARGUMENT AS A FOIL FOR THIS BILL BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAPPENING. SO -- AS ALWAYS WERE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES PROVIDE MORE CLARITY FROM THINGS UP. WITH A FOR DOING THAT THE FUTURE FOR ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU ARE THE MOTION TO DO PASSENGER SHERRY BYE SUMMARY CARILLO SECONDED BY SUMMER JONES SAWYER A MADAM SECTOR PLEASE TAKE WILL. DO PASSED TO JUDICIARY KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SIX FORTY EIGHT WOULD EXPAND CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AROUND WELLNESS PROGRAMS BY DOING THE FOLLOWING ONE ESTABLISHING CLEAR REQUIREMENTS ON FARE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO PROHIBITING AN INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS. THREE REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS INCLUDING DATA USAGE GENERALLY RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND FOR GRANTING WELLNESS PROGRAM ENROLLEES. THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND CORRECT THE COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY OF RECORDS ABOUT THEM. WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE PROMOTED AS A WAY TO SUPPORT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS FOR PARTICIPANTS HOWEVER MANY COME WITH UNSPOKEN TRADE OFFS THEY REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO GIVE UP THEIR PERSONAL DATA. INCLUDING SENSITIVE PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION IN EXCHANGE FOR UNSUPPORTED PROMISES OF WELLNESS AND IN SOME CASES. TO WIN REWARDS THIS UNSPOKEN TRADE OFF THREATENS ENROLLEES PRIVACY AND CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR DISCRIMINATION MANY WELLNESS PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO WEAR A MOBILE DEVICE SUCH AS A FITBIT -- WITH ME IN SUPPORT I'M GONNA CUT THIS SHORT BECAUSE I THINK THIS DOES ENJOY A SUPPORT SO I'M GONNA CUT THIS SHORT THE END AND INTRODUCED A THANK YOU. DANA MENDELSSOHN A DINO MENDELSON FROM CONSUMER REPORTS AS WELL AS TAYLOR JACKSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WHO IF SHE IS STILL HERE AND SHE IS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN KALRA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TINA MENDELSSOHN I AM A SENIOR POLICY COUNSEL FOR CONSUMER PART. PRAGUE BONSOR THIS BILL. HOW CARE COMPLICATED AND SORE ON THE PROGRAM? BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF TYPES AND ALL OF THE OPERATORS OF ON THE PROGRAM THE APPLICATION PRIVACY LAWS THIS BODY AND INCONSISTENT. RENDERING THEM INADEQUATE. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR A BILL WHICH WOULD CREATE A BASELINE OF TRUST IN FAIRNESS FOR ALL OF THE PROGRAM BASED ON TWO PILLARS. COMMONSENSE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND FULL TRANSPARENCY. CONSUMERS HAVE REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA IMAN THIS PROGRAM THE PROGRAM THAT PERSONAL QUESTION SO DID MEDICAL HISTORY REPORTER STRESS INCLUDING PROBLEMS AT WORK. OR SEPARATION DIVORCE PLAN TO BECOME PREGNANT BODY MASS INDEX AND EATING AND EXERCISE HABITS. THIS INFORMATION IS VERY PERSONAL WITH REAL WORLD IMPACT FOR PROGRAM PART THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IMPROVING THEIR ONE THIS. IN ADDITION MORE WEARABLE DEVICES THERE'S PRIVATE PART OF ON THE PROGRAM THE DATA COLLECTED BY WEARABLE BLUNTED PROGRAM TURNING IT INTO A TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE. THAT UNDULY INVASIVE AND GOES BEYOND THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE FOR WITH THE DATA WAS INTENDED. TO PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. BECAUSE THE CURRENT ABSOLUTE PULLED THE PRIVACY LAWS THE DATA COLLECTED BY ONE'S PROGRAM CAN BE USED FOR PURPOSES UNRELATED TO PROMOTING EMPLOYEE BOND THAT. SUCH A SECONDARY USE AND SALE. CONSUMERS WHEN ROLLING ON THE PROGRAM DO SO TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH NOT SO THEY CAN GET TARGETED MARKETING. HOW THEIR ABILITY TO GET AFFORDABLE INSURANCE ALTERED OR MAKE PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES NO TO THEIR EMPLOYERS? POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS FOR LENDERS THAT ACT OF BAD FAITH. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIANS WHO CONSIDER ENROLLING IN OF ALL THE PROGRAM OR WHO ARE ENROLLED IN A WHILE THE PROGRAM. OFTEN HAVE LITTLE WAY TO KNOW THE EXTENT TWITTER DATA WILL BE COLLECTED AND SHARED A VISION NOT BEAR THE BURDEN TO OF ENSURING THAT THEIR DATA IS NOT MISUSED. UNDER A BASIC FORTY EIGHT MOTHER PROGRAM CAN STILL BE OFFERED AND CONSUMER COUNTRY TO PARTICIPATE IF THEY WANT. TO HAVE THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTED WITHOUT UNINTENTIONALLY OR INVOLUNTARILY ENTERING INTO UNFAIR DEALS. FOR THIS REASON CONSUMER REPORTS REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION NURSES ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISSOURIANS BILL WHICH PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS. SEE IN A REPRESENTS UNION REGISTERED NURSES WHO ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THIS BILL AS WELL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN WORKERS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE JUST COMMON SENSE A WORKER SHOULD NEVER BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN A WELLNESS PROGRAM AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT AB SIX FORTY EIGHT WHAT OUTLINED THAT PROTECTION AND ALSO ENSURE WORKERS AREN'T RETALIATED AGAINST IF THEY ELECT NOT TO JOIN A WELLNESS PROGRAM. NURSES KNOW THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LIMIT THE SUCCESS OF WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE HEALTH IS DETERMINED IN PART BY ACCESS TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS AVAILABLE IN OUR HOMES NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES THE QUALITY OF OUR SCHOOLING THE SAFETY OF OUR WORKPLACES THE CLEANLINESS OF OUR WATER FOOD IN AIR. AND THE NATURE OF OUR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS. THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE LIVE EXPLAIN IN PART WHY WEALTHIER AND WHITER COMMUNITIES ARE HEALTHIER THAN BROWN BLACK AND POOR COMMUNITIES. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A JANITOR WHO WORKS NIGHTS IS GETTING EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE GIG ECONOMY WORKER WHO HAS THREE JOBS IS ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY MAKE HEALTHY MEALS AT HOME. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A SURGICAL NURSE IS ABLE TO GET OFF THEIR FEET DURING A TWELVE HOUR SHIFT AND RUST THEIR BACK. REQUIRING WORKERS TO WHERE FITBIT DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE REAL HEALTH ISSUES OUR SOCIETY CAUSES. AB SIX FORTY EIGHT PUTS REASONABLE CONSTRAINTS IN THE LAW TO PROTECT WORKERS AND CONSUMERS WHILE STILL ALLOWING WELLNESS PROGRAMS TO OPERATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB SIX FORTY EIGHT THE NURSES ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI AM JDS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. VERY CLEAR SHE HARM TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] HELLO. THERE IT IS AGAIN ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- WE ARE HERE AND OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS A DISINCENTIVE VICES EMPLOYERS WHO WANT TO PROVIDE WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT. OBVIOUSLY WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED SO BAD TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO THE EMPLOYEE -- TO PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVE FOR EXERCISE FOR MOBILITY FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS HOWEVER. THE DISINCENTIVE IS ATION FROM THIS BILL COMES FROM THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY IMPOSE A CIVIL LIABILITY BUT ALSO CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR SOMETHING AS EASY AS OR AS MINOR AS NOT PROVIDING. THE CORRECT NOTIFICATION AN EXPLANATION ABOUT THE WELLNESS PLAN AND ADDITIONALLY IT PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM RETALIATING OR TAKING ANY ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION. IN RESPONSE OR RELATED TO A MATTER RELATED TO WELLNESS PROGRAM AND FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS HARASSING SOMEONE THAT CAME IN TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF AN EDUCATION REGARDING THE WELLNESS PROGRAM. THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY TO TAKE ANY ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE BECAUSE IT'S RELATED TO A MATTER REGARDING WELLNESS AND THOSE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY U. M. WOULD KICK IN. ADDITIONALLY AT THE THE MANDATES AND THREATS OF LIABILITY BOTH CRIMINAL AND CIVIL WILL SIMPLY ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR ANYONE THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE BY AN EMPLOYER TAKE THE RISK OF EVEN PROVIDING WELLNESS PROGRAM IF THAT'S THAT WHAT THEY'RE FACING. ONE IS PROGRAM INCENTIVIZE GOOD HEALTH AND CONTRIBUTE TO A HEALTHY WORKFORCE AT THIS TIME WHEN A BEE STING CANCER ON THE RISE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE INCREASING IN CALIFORNIA. WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING WELLNESS PROGRAMS RATHER THAN DISINCENTIVE ISING THEM IN THE WORK PLACE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. BUT A NICKEL WITH US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS I THINK THE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CHAMBER COVERED ALL THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES -- WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL OUR CONCERN IS THAT WERE LOADING THESE HELPFUL PROGRAMS UP WITH. ON A LEVEL OF RULES REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE -- WE HAVE REACH OUT TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND YOU KNOW LOOK FORWARD SOME MEETINGS. WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CURRENT LAWS AND SUFFICIENT IN THIS AREA. AND TO LEARN ABOUT A REAL WORLD EXAMPLES -- THAT WOULD YOU KNOW BACK UP SOME HYPOTHETICALS I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THEIR TESTIMONY SO AT THIS TIME WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE ONLY BE JOURNALISTIC YOU CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ECHOING THE COMMENTS MADE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. OKAY. BACK TO COMMITTEE. WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM THE SUMMER GONZALEZ SECOND BY SUMMER CARILLO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SUMMER IS VERY MUCH LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I'LL JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE OPPOSITION I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A WORK IN PROGRESS -- I'M ASSUMING WHEN THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY ISSUE WAS MENTIONED IT WAS ABOUT THE MISDEMEANOR POTENTIAL BUT I I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM UP WITH THAT I A I I DO THAT THESE PRO I DO AGREE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE WONDERFUL -- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT SHOULD HAVE ANY LOOPHOLES TO BE ABUSED SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU KALRA. AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CREEL. REAL ID GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I AM JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US. THREE OF US THANK YOU THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR MAIENSCHEIN. AND WILL HAVE A SUMMER GONZALEZ PRESENT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN. THAT COULD BE A QUESTION CAN ASK THE PRESENTER. YEAH THAT WON'T WORK EITHER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR LETTING ME AS TESTIFY IN PLACE OF MISTER MAIENSCHEIN WHO IS USING ONE OF HIS THREE PAID SICK DAYS TODAY. I'M JUST YET WE DO HAVE SICK DAYS YES -- NOT ENOUGH. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTET WORKERS CALIFORNIA'S EPIDEMIC OF DEADLY WILDFIRES CONTINUE TO WORSEN WILDFIRE SMOKE CONSISTS OF DIFFERENT GASES AND FINE PARTICULATE. PART [inaudible] PARTICULATES. PARTICLES. THANK YOU -- SOME FROM BURNING VEGETATION OTHER FROM BURNING STRUCTURES AND OFTEN -- HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH AS BEST AS LEAD AND OTHER TOXINS. I HEARD TO MOTIONS I DON'T WANNA GO TOO FAR AB ELEVEN POINT WORLD REQUIRE OSHA -- THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO MAKE APPROPRIATE EFFECTIVE RESPIRATORS AVAILABLE TO OUTDOOR WORKERS ON ANY DAY THOSE WORKERS COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED BE EXPOSED TO HARMFUL AT LEVELS OF WILD FIRE SMOKE -- OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED PLAYERS SEND WORKERS HOME. PREFERABLY WITH PAY -- BUT UNDER. THE EXTREME CONDITIONS AT LEAST A RESPIRATOR IS WORN TED I RESPECT LAST FOR MY VOTE THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE BID. HAVE MORE TESTIMONY WE HAVE A MOTION AND BASED CHAIR FLORENCE OR SECOND SECOND SECOND WAS AMERICA THANK YOU PLEASE. THEY GET YOUR KALRA MEMBERS MITCH DYER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL TO BETTER PROTECT OUTDOOR WORKERS FROM EXPOSURE TO WILD FIRE SMOKE. AS MOST OF US IN CALIFORNIA -- PAINFULLY AWARE THIS IS A HAZARD THAT GETS WORSE EVERY YEAR -- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF YOU HAVE TO WORK OUTSIDE THESE ENVIRONMENTS OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH WE SAW HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN LAST YEAR WHERE WORKERS WERE FORCED TO WORK OUTSIDE WITH NOTHING NO MASKS NO RESPIRATORS NO NOTHING AND? IT IT GOES A LOT BECAUSE PRETTY FAR BEYOND JUST DAMAGING YOUR THROAT MAKING A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO BREATHE IT DOES PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR LONG FUNCTION WE ALL INHALED A LOT OF DIFFERENT CARCINOGENS SO ON THERE'S A LOT OF PERMANENT DAMAGE DONE AND THAT'S JUST FROM. WALKING AROUND IF YOU HAVE TO WORK IN THIS KIND OF AIR YOUR SPENDING EIGHT HOURS EXERTING YOURSELF ON THE DAMAGE IS FAR WORSE. AND SO WE DO HAVE EXISTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM THIS HAZARD BUT THEY KIND OF SPANISH RANGE FROM EITHER SO VAGUE THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THEM TOO SO CUMBERSOME THAT EVERYONE JUST KIND OF IGNORES THEM. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT IS PETITION THE STANDARDS BOARD TO COME UP WITH NEW EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING WORKERS. THAT PROCESS IS HAPPENING AND IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL BUT WE BELIEVE WE NEED A BILL TO KIND OF GUIDE THE PROCESS IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS ONE REASON IS THAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY THE THRESHOLD WHEN EMPLOYER ACTION IS NECESSARY. RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS THAT BASICALLY EMPLOYERS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING WHEN THERE'S A HARMFUL EXPOSURE. AND THERE'S A DEFINITION IN THERE BUT IT KIND OF REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO BE BOTH DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SOMETHING IS HARMFUL AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR BY TELLING THE STANDARDS BOARD TO DO SOMETHING RELATED TO THE AIR QUALITY INDEX. IT'S MORE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND MORE CLEAR WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A VERY TEMPERATE TEMPORARY VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION FROM THE MEDICAL EVALUATION AND FIT TESTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT. WOULD ESSENTIALLY REQUIRED EMPLOYER BRING A DOCTOR OUT AND DO AN EXAMINATION OF EVERY SINGLE OUTDOOR WORKER BEFORE THEY COULD WEAR AND IN NINETY FIVE MASK AND THAT'S WE THINK SOMETHING THAT'S PRETTY UNREALISTIC FOR MOST EMPLOYERS SO WE WANT TO COME UP WITH A VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION TO THAT. AND ALSO AN EFFECTIVE DATE SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING STRONG AND PLACE FOR THIS YEAR'S FIRE SEASON I AND WE ARE JUST FOR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- I'M IN COTTON FROM CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF WORK SAFE ANOTHER OF CO SPONSOR -- A VERY A VAST BODY OF STUDIES HAS DETERMINED THAT EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE COMPROMISE LUNG FUNCTION. EXACERBATE HEART PROBLEMS AND CAUSED DIFFICULTY BREATHING. AND FARMWORKERS LANDSCAPERS AND OTHER OUTDOOR WORKERS URGENTLY NEED PROTECTION. A CLEAR PROTECTION -- THAT WOULD -- REQUIRE RESPIRATORS BE MADE AVAILABLE -- WHEN THEY'RE ON HEALTHY LEVELS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE? THE AIR QUALITY INDEX IS A READILY AVAILABLE -- WAITED DETERMINE WHEN -- RESPIRATOR SHOULD BE REQUIRED SHOULD -- BE MADE AVAILABLE AND AND IT'S BEEN -- IT IS ACCEPTED BY THE CONSENSUS OF HEALTH EXPERT WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS GERMAN RECESS OR DO AS A BEHALF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

WHEN WE HIVE HIGH LEVELS THE BAY AREA WE TELL PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES -- LITERALLY AND SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS BILL ON THE ISLE OF SPEECH CERTAIN THANK YOU AUTHORS WELL CLOSE. RESPECT LAST VERY VOTE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WE HAVE A BY SUMMER CARILLO. OF WILL PLEASE. DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATE KALRA. AYE KALRA AYE FLORA AYE FLORA AYE. CARILLO ID GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US THREE OF US HI RIGHT THE BILL IS OUT HAVE A HAPPY LIFE. ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSUMING WE'RE DOING AB FOUR OH THREE HI SIR. READY WHEN YOU ARE [inaudible] THANK YOU. AB FOUR OH THREE INCREASES THE STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR FILING A WORK RETALIATION CLAIM FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREE YEARS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR PREVAILING EMPLOYEES. WORKPLACE RETALIATION OCCURS WHEN EMPLOYEES DISCHARGED THREATENED WITH A DISCHARGED EMOTE SUSPENDER SUBJECT EMPLOYEES TO AN ADVERSE ACTION INCLUDING THREATS OF DEPORTATION FOR ACCESS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS. UNDER LABOR CODE TELL YOU SHE'S NOT ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO GROWING PROBLEM TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. IN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RETALIATION COMPLETE REPORT TO LEGISLATURE THE LABOR COMMISSION REPORT RECEIVING NINETY FIVE COMPLAINTS. ALLEGING VIOLATIONS THE LABOR CODE INSIDE DOUBLING. OF THE NUMBER RETALIATION PLANS BASED UPON SEX RACE OR ETHNICITY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND IT TOOK SPECIFIC NOTE OF AN INSTANT ROLE WORKER TO BE A DAILY FROM MEXICO INTO THE U. S. WAS REPORTED BY FEDERAL CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL BY HIS EMPLOYER IN RETALIATION FOR HIS FILING. OF AN UNPAID WAGE CLAIM. AS A RESULT THE REQUISITE TANDAS TOURIST PIECE WAS CONFISCATED HE WAS REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES. UPON LEARNING OF THE EMPLOYERS ACT THE BORDER AGENT WHO DETAINED THE WORKER WAS THE PERSONAL ENCOURAGE THE WORKER TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE RETALIATION. IN RESPONSE ABOUT RETALIATION COMPLAINT ONE AND THE CASE IS ALSO REFERRED TO DEAL AS SEIZE LEGAL UNIT FOR FURTHER ENFORCEMENT. NOW IMAGINE THE WORK WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO ACROSS PASSED WITH A BORDER AGENT MORE INFORMED OF HIS RIGHTS. THE MATCH OF THE WORK WAS DETAINED DEPORTED IN UNABLE TO OBTAIN HIS RIGHT TO BACK MAJORS. AND IMAGINE THE WORK WAS UNABLE TO MEET THE CURRENT. SIX MONTH WINDOW IN ORDER FOLLOWS RETALIATION CLAIM DUE TO THAT UNLAWFUL DEPORT DEPORTATION. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OF WHY THE EXTENSION OF THE CLAIMS TIMELINE IS NECESSARY. REGARDING ATTORNEYS FEES TWO YEARS AGO LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB NINETY SIX INTO LAW WHICH PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT THE RIGHT TO RESUME ALL ATTORNEYS FEES. FROM THE EMPLOYER IF THE LABOR COMMITTEE COMMISSIONER PREVAILS. THIS BILL SIMPLY BUILT UPON SB NINETY SIX BY PROVIDING THAT SAME RIGHT TO PRIVATE INSURANCE TO TAKE THESE RETALIATION CASES OFTEN ON PRO PRO BONO STATUS. ON BEHALF BEHALF WORKERS AND IT ONLY IN TITLES. OF IT ONLY INTO A TITLES FEES IF THE WORKER PREVAILS. OFTENTIMES THE BURDEN OF PAYING ATTORNEYS FEES CAN BE A DETERRENT FOR AGREE OF WORKERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WERE LOW WAGE EVEN IF THEY HAVE A STRONG CLAIM. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE NEGATION OF THE OPPOSITION ARGUES RATHER IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE WAYS FOR WORKERS TO PURSUE RECOURSE. WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY RETALIATED AGAINST FOR INVOKING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW? I HAVE WITH ME. AMERICA YOUR USER HARA AND CAITLIN VEGAS BECAUSE PART OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. OKAY MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS MARICA YOSHIHARU ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. OUR MEMBERS PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE OF REPRESENTATION TO THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES. ATTORNEYS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS WELL AS NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR ATTORNEYS VERY OFTEN DO NOT HEAR FROM WORKERS ABOUT RETALIATION COMPLAINS UNTIL WELL AFTER SIX MONTHS. IF THE RETALIATION INVOLVES TERMINATION THE WORKERS FIRED THEN WORKERS MIGHT COME FORWARD RIGHT AWAY BUT AS WE ALL KNOW RETALIATION OFTEN IS MUCH MORE SUBTLE THAT INCLUDES BEING NOT BEING PASSED UP FOR PROMOTION THERE WERE HOURS ARE CUT THIRD. SHIFT IS CHANGED IN THOSE SITUATIONS WORKERS OFTEN JUST TRY TO WAIT THINGS OUT AND HOPE THINGS GET BETTER. AND BY THAT AND OFTENTIMES THINGS DON'T GET BETTER AND AT THAT POINT THEY WILL TRY TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS IN WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY MISS THEIR SIX MONTH FILING DEADLINE. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WORKERS ARE NOT DOT TO DOT DENIED ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY EXTENDING THAT FILING DEADLINE. THIS BILL ALSO WILL ALLOW WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES IF THE RETALIATION INVOLVES WHISTLE BLOWING WHICH WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT -- LABOR CODE SECTION ELEVEN A TWO POINT FIVE IS THE MAIN WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTE THAT PROTECTS WORKERS FROM RETALIATION IF THEY REPORT VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL LAWS. ON IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE STATUE WAS AMENDED BY SB SIX SIX SIX IN AB TWO SIXTY THREE TO ALSO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED FROM A TALLY ASIAN. ART TOURNEY'S USE LABOR CODE SECTION ELEVEN OH TOO BUT POINT FIVE TO PROTECT WORKERS WHO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE WE'VE HAD WORKERS WE HAVE I'D ATTORNEYS REPRESENT WILL SO BLOWERS WHO -- THE PHARMACY TECH WHO WHO WAS RIVER WHO WAS DONE. SHE WAS TOLD TO DILATE -- TO DILUTES SORRY TO THE LOO -- CHEMO MEDICATION AND WHEN SHE REPORTED IT TO OSHA SHE WAS FIRED JUST. WEEKS LATER. SO IN THIS SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A WORKER WHO IS ABOUT TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FRAUD ABUSE MISCONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THE WORKERS ABLE TO SECURE LEGAL COUNSEL. AND WITHOUT ATTORNEYS HIS PROVISION THAT MEANS THAT THE WORKERS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATION THROUGH A PORTION OF THE AWARD THEY RECOVER AT THE END OF THE CASE. AND FOR A LOT OF WORKERS THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO FIND AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE OF THE COST OF LITIGATION IS GOING TO EXCEED THAT CONTINGENCY FEE. THAT THE ATTORNEY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THE AWARD THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE ON THOSE CASES SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALIGN THIS WAS A BLUR STATUE WITH ALL OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTES THAT HAVE A AN ATTORNEY'S FEE PROVISION. WE THINK THAT THAT WAS A BLOWER LAWS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING THEIR JOBS TO TO REPORT WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- WHEN AN EMPLOYER ENGAGES IN RETALIATION THAT MEANS THAT THE WORKER HAS ALREADY BEEN THE VICTIM OF AN UNDERLYING ACT THEY'VE HAD WAGES STOLEN THEY'VE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED? THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PAID FAIRLY ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND THEN WHEN THEY REPORTED THEY GET RETALIATED AGAINST. THIS IS SO THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A REPEAT OFFENDER THIS IS AN EMPLOYER WHO IS NOT ONLY VIOLATING THE LAW BUT THEN ACTING IN A WAY -- TO TO INTIMIDATE WORKERS FOR TRYING TO COME FORWARD AND SPEAK OUT. A TO LIMIT THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS TO SIX MONTHS IS REALLY A WAY OF INSULATING EMPLOYERS WHO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR -- ALMOST ALL WORKERS TO REPORT WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS DO FACE RETALIATION AND SO ALLOWING THEM THE TIME TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT. IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CHANGE TO THE LOST SO WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT I WAS RETALIATED. BECAUSE I SPOKE OUT OF BOUNDS. ABOUT GENDER PAY DISPARITIES. I FILED AN EQUAL PAY CLAIM AND RETALIATION CLAIM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. BUT IT WAS REJECTED BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER RETALIATION HAD BEGUN. I FILED MY EQUAL PAY RETALIATION CLAIMS. BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A LAWYER. THAT WOULD TAKE MY CASE. WORKERS ABILITY TO FIND A LAWYER SHOULD NOT DICTATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT SHE HAS TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR BEING RETALIATE RETALIATED AGAINST. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT MY SITUATION AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS SISTER DEALS AND WE HAVE THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO [inaudible] THANK YOU.

KATIE WHICH IT FOR LEGAL AID AT WORK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. YOU ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS NAME HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY FOUR OH THREE AT THE SAME POSITION THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND HIS STAFF. IN TALKING WITH US -- ABOUT THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH US HOWEVER OUR CONCERNS ARE NOT WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE IMITATIONS -- WE ARE THAT PART PROVISION WE ARE FINE WITH -- BECAUSE THAT PROVISION ALLOWS FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO FILE RETALIATION CLAIM THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT -- WHICH HOLD THE HAND OF THE EMPLOYEE BUT WE WE ARE CONCERNED WITH IS THE THE ADDITIONAL ATTORNEY FEE RECOVERY AND OUR CONCERN WITH THAT IS IS THAT. EMPLOYEES ALREADY HAVE THE OPTION TO GO THROUGH CIVIL COURT THEY CAN FILE THIS CLAIM IN CIVIL COURT AND SO IT WHEN THEY FILE IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IT'S OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT WANT THE MORE LITIGIOUS PROCESS THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO. THROUGH COR SO IF YOU ADD THE ATTORNEY FEE RECOVERY PROVISION TO THIS PROCESS WHERE THE EMPLOYER ACTUALLY HAS NO RIGHT TO HEARING THEY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THEY HAVE NO PER -- OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN REMEDIATE THOSE ATTORNEYS FEES THAT COULD QUICKLY ADD UP. AND THEN WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IT WILL BECOME MORE LITIGIOUS IN MORE OF A REASON FOR FRIVOLOUS PLANES AND SO WHILE WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THE BILL OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT ADDING A ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES PROVISION WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THIS PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN WORKING. MORE LITIGIOUS WHEN THE EMPLOYEE ALREADY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY FILE IN CIVIL COURT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A SIDEBAR. YES WE WERE. WE'RE ALWAYS IT ALWAYS CONFERRING WE'RE ALWAYS CONFERRING YEAH ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE THE GAVEL NOW. OKAY NO WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT SUPPORT QUITE YET. JUST ONE MORE AMENDMENT ONE MORE MOMENT -- WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MISS CURTIS OUTLINE WHICH IS NO OBJECTION TO THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WHICH I THINK IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WORKED WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND CENTER HERTZBERG ON SB THREE OH SIX WHICH IS REFERENCE AT THE TOP OF YOUR ANALYSIS ON PAGE. THREE WHICH GAVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER INJUNCTIVE AUTHORITY AND GREATER POWER TO DEAL WITH RETALIATION CLAIMS AND WE PREFER TO HAVE SOME TIME.

THREE OF US I MISTER CHAIR THAT BILLS OUT IN HUSING AB SIX TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SB -- SIX TWENTY FIVE EXTENDS THE EMPLOYEE RETENTION 10% BID PREFERENCE TO ALL PUBLIC TRANSIT CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE 10% BID PREFERENCES SCORING CREDIT ON A STATE BID FOR A TRANSIT OPERATOR THAT VOLUNTARILY AGREES TO RETAIN THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. OF THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTOR CRIMINAL NINETY DAYS THE WAITERS AND BENEFITS OF ANY RETAINED EMPLOYER NOT REQUIRED TO BE THE SAME AS ON THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTOR. UP UNDER CURRENT LAW IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT SLOW. LEGISLATION WAS SIGNED TO PROVIDE A 10% BID PREFERENCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC TRANSIT OF CONTRACTS A BITTER THAT BONTA AGREED RETAIN THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTOR. THE PURPOSE OF THAT LAW WAS TO ADDRESS THE HIGH RATE OF TURNOVER OCCURRING IN THE CONTRACT A SEGMENT OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. HOWEVER THAT LEGISLATION NOT PROVIDED BIDDING PREFERENCE FOR BIDDERS ON STATE CONTRACTS -- IN PUBLIC TRANSIT AGREED TO RETAIN EXISTING EMPLOYEES. STATE TRANSIT WORKERS JOBS ARE AT RISK DUE TO CONTRACTING OUT FOR EXAMPLE STATE EMPLOYEES WERE SUBTLE DRIVERS AT HEARST CASTLE. LOST THEIR JOBS OR NEW CONTRACTOR CAME IN HAD A BID PREFERENCE BEEN IN PLACE A PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTOR WOULD HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE DRIVERS IN THE DRIVERS WILL LIKELY STILL BE WORKING. TODAY WE MUST ACT TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY TRANSIT WORKER LAYOFFS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK WOULD BE TO TEST BY SHANE GUSMAN WITH THE TEAMSTERS. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE INLAND BOATMEN UNION AND THE TEAMSTERS -- BOTH CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL -- MISTER KALRA SAID IT ALL -- WE SUPPORT THE BILL IT'S WORKED VERY WELL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT HASN'T INCREASED COST AND IT HELPED WORKERS RETAIN THEIR JOBS -- DRIVE UP. ROBERT ESTRADA AND REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE INLAND OPENS UNION OF THE PACIFIC WE ARE CO SPONSORS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. THANK YOU TO TO CHAIRMAN KALRA FOR CARRYING THIS BILL AND TO THE COMMITTEE AT LARGE FOR HOPEFULLY PASSING WITH A STRONG. AYE VOTE -- SO THIS IS NOT ACADEMIC TO US THIS IS NOT MERELY HYPOTHETICAL -- EITHER PASSED OR PROLOGUE WE HAVE HAD -- WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WHERE DO CONTRACTORS OF COME IN. AND WHERE IN FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT THE JOB IS THE SAME THE SERVICE IS THE SAME. AND AND EVEN INTO TIMES THE VESSELS REMAIN THE SAME THE ONLY THING PERVERSELY THAT CHANGED WAS THAT. V. OBJECTIVELY MOST QUALIFIED AND MOST EXPERIENCED CREW MEMBERS WERE REMOVED FROM THE EQUATION. AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S REASONABLE FAIR OR JUST ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE WERE EMPLOYMENT AND AND WORKERS MATTER. SO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US NOW GOING FORWARD IS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ANGEL ISLAND -- STATE FOR CONTRACTS THAT BETTER OUT THERE ONE OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNIONIZED ONE OF WHICH IS NOT -- WHETHER OR NOT. OUR OUR UNION CONTRACTED COMPANY PICKS UP AN ADDITIONAL. CONTRACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE OR WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT CONTRACT IS LOST TO A NON UNION CONTRACTOR. IN EITHER OF THOSE INSTANCES WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE WORKERS SHOULD SUFFER WE WOULD NOT WANT THE CURRENT WORKERS OF RECORD TO SUFFERED SHE JUST TO IN JUST TO ADD MORE WORK TO OUR OWN UNION RANKS. WE WOULD THINK THAT THE JOB ONE OF ANY UNION AND ANY JUST SOCIETY IS TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE WERE WORKING. AND AND TO GIVE A PREFERENCE WILL BENEFIT TO ANYBODY WHO SAYS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AND TRY TO HELP PROTECT THOSE WORKERS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE PLEASE THANK YOU.
