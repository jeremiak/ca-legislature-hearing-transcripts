THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS -- IMPORTANT BILL. WILL HELP -- CALIFORNIA MEET IT'S CLEANER TARGETS -- SP FOUR FIVE SEVEN IS A BILL TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S INNOVATIONS. ON BY A METHANE -- THIS IS A STRATEGY AMONG -- SEVERAL OF THE STATE'S -- STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. IF YOU RECALL LAW LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AS BEFORE. TO FORTY MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU WERE VERY HELPFUL AND AND GETTING THAT BILL PASSED LAST YEAR WHICH REQUIRES A CPC TO ESTABLISH. PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BY METHANE. THIS BILL IS A COMPLIMENT TERRY MEASURE BUT MUST MUCH MORE MODEST EFFORT THIS BILL EXTENDS A SUNSET DATE. FIVE FIVE YEARS FROM. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX OF FOR AN EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT -- WILL ALLOW BILE METHANE PROJECTS TO INTERCONNECT WITH THE GAS UTILITY PIPELINE SYSTEMS. ANY OF THOSE PROJECTS. ARE UNDER WAY BUT WILL NOT BE BUILT IN TIME TO QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM -- THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURAL INVESTMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE CURRENTLY THAT HAVE DRAWN INVESTORS OUR STATE TO HELP US WITH THESE GOALS. UNDER UNDER THE PROGRAM. OF THESE PROJECTS CAN RECEIVE UP INTERCONNECTION COSTS. ONLY AFTER THE PROJECTS ARE BUILT AND OPERATED AND OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED -- SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY BUT NOT WILL NOT BE READY IN TIME TO MEET THE PROP PROGRAMS -- OF DATE. THE STATE WIDE FUNDING FOR THE MONETARY INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS IS CAPPED AT FORTY MILLION TOTAL. SO THERE IS ALREADY THAT -- BUILT INTO THE LAW [inaudible] AND AND AS I MENTIONED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE PROGRAM'S MOVING FORWARD -- SIMPLY -- EXTENDING THE DATE WILL ENSURE THAT THESE -- VERY IMPORTANT PROJECTS ARE AFFORDED THE TIME THAT THEY ARE AND THAT THEY THEY NEED TO COMPLETE CONNECT AND OPERATE THEIR INTERCONNECTION PROJECTS AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES TO US. NEED A CAR. FOR SEVENTY NINE WEST. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICK A POOR AND THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS -- THE RG COALITION IS COMPRISED OF OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE LEADING MEMBERS FROM EACH SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY INCLUDING ORGANIZED LABOR UTILITIES AND THE PRODUCERS OF OVER 90%. OF ALL RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN NORTH AMERICA. HI WINNER CONNECTION CALIFORNIA IS UP TO SIX TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS IT IS IN NEIGHBORING STATES. DUE TO THIS THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN FORCED TO CONSTRUCT THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. IRONICALLY MUCH OF THE ARE IN G. THAT IS PRODUCED IS THEN DELIVERED BACK INTO CALIFORNIA FOR USE IN IT VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS. THE BY A METHANE MONETARY INCENTIVE PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO HELP COVER THE COST OF INTERCONNECTION IN ORDER TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD AND ALLOW US TO INVEST IN AND CREATE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS. FOR CALIFORNIA SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN PRODUCE MORE OF THE ARE IN G. THAT IT CONSUMES AND REALIZE THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF DOING SO. ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN CLIMATE CHANGE COPING PLAN REPLACING FOSSIL FUELS OR BIO METHANE AND MAKING IT COST EFFECTIVELY AVAILABLE IS KEY TO REDUCING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. DECREASING DEMAND. NO NATURAL GAS AND HELPING THE STATE ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGET. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT WE HAVE A QUORUM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A ROLE CALLED [inaudible] HOLDEN. HOLDEN HERE PATTERSON PATTERSON HERE BURKE. BURKE HERE CARILLO. CARILLO HERE CHEN.

OKAY WE HAVE A CORE -- WILL TURN YOUR NEXT WITNESS TO HOLDEN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TIM CARMICHAEL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. IT JUST IT TEARS HEARD ME SAY THIS A FEW TIMES THIS YEAR BUT LAST YEAR MARY NICHOLS CHAIR THE A RESOURCES BOARD TESTIFIED IN TWO DIFFERENT CLIMATE HEARINGS IN THE CAPITAL. THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY FOR SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WE DON'T HAVE A CLIMATE STRATEGY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS A PROGRAM AND THE EXTENSION AT THE SENATORS BILL IS PROPOSING IS REALLY A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THAT SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. STRATEGY BECAUSE WE NEED. PLACES TO TAKE THE FUEL THAT IS CREATED BY -- THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT IS TO PUT IT INTO INTER CONNECTED INTO THE PIPELINE -- AND THE FACT IS IT'S TAKING LONGER THAN ANYONE OF ANY OF US WOULD HAVE LIKE TO GET SOME OF THESE PROJECTS UP AND RUNNING. THEY CAN'T CLAIM THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT TILL THEY'RE UP AND RUNNING AND THIS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IT YOU KNOW IT'S HAD A BROAD BASE OF SUPPORT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THE CAL RECYCLE AND THEIR BEER ESTIMATING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED PROJECTS. STATEWIDE -- TO ADDRESS ORGANIC WASTE THE END AND I'M NOT TALK ABOUT COMPOSTING THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE COMPOSTING TYPE PROJECTS. AND SO THIS FUNDING. YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SUPPORT A DOZEN MAYBE TWO DOZEN INTERCONNECTS OVERTIME SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. BUT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM WE ENVISION IS GOING TO BE NEEDED GOING. FORWARD OVER THE NEXT DECADE BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE AND THE NEED FOR THIS -- PART OF THE SOLUTION. TO THE PIPELINES UP AND DOWN THE STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR -- WE HAD AMENDMENTS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THEM AND YES MA'AM. HOW WILL NOW TAKE -- TESTIMONY OR COMMENTS -- ME TO SERVE YOU WELL SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TO RELIVE LÃ  HOSTS -- FOR PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY -- IN SUPPORT FOR REASONS MY COLLEAGUE AS STATED IT THIS IS SIMPLY AN EXTENSION OF TIME NOT ADDITIONAL MONEY PDS SUPPORTIVE OF GREENING -- OUR PIPELINE AND THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY WE CAN THANK YOU. MOVE THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MARKET PREY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES WE WANT TO ASSOCIATE OUR SUPPORT WITH THE PRIOR WITNESSES AND DRIVE VOTE. MADDIE MUNSON ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MUCH OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND MORE THAN FIFTY PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE HERE. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I GET AFTERNOON -- PREVIOUS IN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE BRIEF -- WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IN DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND AND DIFFERENT CONTACTS WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE SUBSIDIZATION OF A CLUSTER PROJECTS OF GAS INJECTION PROJECTS. AND OF THE KIND OF PERVERSE INCENTIVE OF INCREASING OUR PRODUCTION OF MANY WERE -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING GAS WHEN WE REALLY SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR DOLLARS AND OUR MONEY AND OUR SUBSIDIES ON REALLY GREENING THE ENVIRONMENT REALLY GREENING ENERGY SECTOR. AND LOOKING AT ZERO EMISSION AND AND NO MISSION I'M TECHNOLOGIES -- AND AGAIN -- UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION -- JULIE JORDAN WITH CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO OTHERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY I TURNED BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS DOCTOR BURKE -- JUST TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT'S MUCH BETTER. A AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CHANGE OUT THEIR STOVES AND THEIR HEATING SYSTEMS TOMORROW. SO THE MORE OF THIS MATERIAL WE CAN GET IN THE PIPELINE THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE. THANK YOU. YOUR MURATSUCHI. COULD YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE ADDRESS THE THE CONCERN RAISED BY THE THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF INS INCENTIVIZING MANEUVER PRODUCTION. HI YOU KNOW I I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT I I THINK IT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING ON REYES MORE CATTLE SIMPLY TO PRODUCE MORE MOVEMENT OR JUST. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT I MAYBE VIEW MIND. ONE FIVE FIVE THE REPRESENTED I'M I'M I'M BEING TOLD THAT A BETTER ANSWER WOULD COME FROM THE ACTUAL DAIRY INDUSTRY. I'M SURE THE SENATOR HAS A LOT OF GREAT THINGS TO SAY ON THIS TOPIC BUT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. THE NUMBER OF DAIRIES IN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY BEEN DECLINING FOR MANY YEARS AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF CALORIES IN THE STATE DECLINE ALSO. SO NONE OF OUR DATA SUPPORTS THE ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE -- LARGER AND MORE JERRY -- PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA WILL DO THAT THE BETTER ANSWER [inaudible] DOCTOR EGGMAN. I THINK YOU KNOW JUST GOING TO SAY AS AS IS THAT YOUR BAG AND MY FOR A FIRST YEAR WE LOOK AT ISSUES OF MILK PRICING AND I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRICING AND AND THEN I THOUGHT I EVER WOULD -- BUT YEAH THE THE THE ISSUE REMAINS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF A LOT OF OUR ARE VERY PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND A pTHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE'VE SEEN THE AMOUNT OF DARES GO DOWN BUT THENABOUT HOUSE HAVE NOT WHICH MEANS THAT -- THE SMALL GUYS CAN'T CONTINUE TO COMPETE AND SO THEY GET SOLD OUT BY THE LARGER CORPORATE FORMS -- WHICH YOU KNOW IS IN A BAD WORD IS BECAUSE THAT IF YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FARM IN BULK -- SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY INCENTIVE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE NEWER CONSUMED -- ARE PRODUCED BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AS COST EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE TO TO PRODUCED -- DERES UP PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS ONE MORE AVENUE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. AS MY FRIEND DR QUIRK SAID IN ADDITION TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ELECTRIC GRID OVERNIGHT WE'VE GOT CAL IS HERE WE'VE BY. I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT WE STILL WANT AGRICULTURE TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE SAFEST. FOOD AND THEN -- AND FARMING PRACTICES. SO WHY NOT CELEBRATE THOSE AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE SO THANK YOU FOR THIS. THANK YOU. OF THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS -- MR TING. JUST A QUICK QUESTION COULD COULD YOU GIVE ME EXAMPLES OF THE PROJECT THAT HAVE BEEN. FUNDED OR JUST WHAT TYPES OF FIVE PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN FUNDING. SO I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY FUNDED ONE IS AC. R. NAHR WHICH IS IN THE CALIFORNIA TOWN OF PARIS -- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP -- BUT THAT IS IT IS ONE OF THE MODEL PROJECTS FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY ACTUALLY THEY ARE TAKING A MUNICIPAL ORGANIC WASTE FROM SEVERAL CITIES. PROCESSING IT -- PUT PROVIDING SOME OF THAT FUEL FOR THE REFUSE TRUCKS THAT SERVICE OF CITIES AND PUTTING SOME OF THE FUEL -- RENEWAL RENEWAL AFTER GAS INTO. THE PIPELINE -- THE SECOND ONE IS THAT CALTRAIN AND THAT'S IN PIXLEY CALIFORNIA AND THAT IT'S A DAIRY PROJECT THAT IS CURRENTLY INTERCONNECTED AND INJECTING INTO SO CAUCUSES GRID QUESTION SO. SENATOR YOU CAN CLOSE TO BE LIKE. I'M SORRY -- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT AND THAT IS THAT THE FACILITY IN PARIS IS. VERY IMPRESSIVE FACILITY AND NOT UP TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T. RECALL THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT -- THAT THEY HAVE THERE BUT THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT. I TO JUST WANTED YOU KNOW STATE THAT THAT YOU KNOW I WANT TO GET TO THESE. YOUR MISSION YOU KNOW GOALS OF THE STATE TOMORROW. BUT WE'RE WE'RE QUITE A WAYS FROM GETTING THERE AND THERE'S THIS IN BETWEEN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR THE BIO FUELS IN GENERAL -- TO SERVE A PURPOSE -- AYE AYE YOU REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT. IS KIND OF A HUB FOR BIO FUEL DEVELOPMENT -- AN AREA THAT I'VE REPEATEDLY SAID IN CENTER WEST ON I SHARE -- REPRESENTATION OF THIS AREA THAT'S GOT THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT SAY CALIFORNIA 16%. A WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MEETING SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AS WELL SO JUST WANTED STATE -- MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND AND THE REASONS WHY. THE IF NORTHERN GOT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN TIME FOR THE PROJECTS TO DEVELOP RESOURCES AREN'T. REALIZES RESOURCES NO ADDITIONAL. OF DOLLARS ARE BEING ADDED TO THIS AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE -- TO AS THERE'S BEEN STATED CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS TO BE CREATED AS WELL AS ADDRESSING. ALTERNATIVE WAYS -- TO GUITAR GOALS. ANY CLOSING COMMENTS PLEDGES -- SIMPLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO RESTATE THAT WE DO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED.
