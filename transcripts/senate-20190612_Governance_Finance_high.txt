TWO ELEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I WILL START BY TAKING THE COMMITTEE MEMBER AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK VIEW IN YOUR COMMITTEE -- YOUR THESE MEMONS I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THEM ACTUALLY DO MADE THE BILL BETTER OPEN UP TO MORE PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- ONE OF THE GREATEST HURDLES THAT STUDENTS IN THE FAMILY SPACE IN CALIFORNIA. IS WHEN THEY'RE CONTEMPLATING WHETHER TO PURSUE A HIGHER EDUCATION GIVEN THE SKYRIDE ROCKETING COSTS OF ATTENDING COLLEGE A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN IS A FEDERALLY TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS PLAN DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE EDUCATION COSTS. CALIFORNIA EXAMS. COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT EARNINGS FROM TAXES IF FUNDS ARE WITHDRAWN. ALL OF AYE HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES BUT NO INCENTIVE IS PROVIDED TO PROVIDE PROACTIVELY ENCOURAGE SAVINGS IN A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY SEVEN STATES WITH THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX THAT DOES NOT OFFER A TAX INCENTIVE FOR SAVING WITH A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. SUPPORTING STUDENTS CALLS JOURNEY IS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT OUR STATE CAN MAKE AND LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS BILL DOES THIS BY PROVIDING A TAX DEDUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO A SCHOLARSHIP BY TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT WITH A LIMIT OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR SINGLE FILERS AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THOSE WHO FILE JOINTLY I'M OF THE MINDSET THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SKYROCKETING EDUCATION COSTS WE DON'T WANT. CASA COLLEGE GET TO CONTINUE TO BE AN EMPLOYMENT FOR STUDENTS AND AND YOUNG FOLKS TO PURSUE A COLLEGE EDUCATION -- AND SO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR SAVING IN FIVE TWENTY NINE COUNTALLOWS US TO HAVE ONE MORE TOOL TO HELP. LESSEN THAT BURDEN AND I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE A TAX DEDUCTION AND THERE SHOULD BE AN INCENTIVE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR SAVING FOR THIS PURPOSE BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS THAT IT MEANS. FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS KELSEY O'CONNOR WAS DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION FOR THE STATE TREASURER'S. OFFICE MYSTERY ON MOM AND STANDS AT THOUGH WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THIS CULTURE INVESTMENT BOARD. IT'S A CAR THE WHITE. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE RAINS CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER AND CHAIR OF THE SCHOLARS YOUR INVESTMENT BOARD FIONA. IS VERY CONCERNING TO OUR OFFICE THAT STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN THE U. S. HAS NOW TOPPED ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION IT'S TO PASS AUTOMOBILE AUTOMOBILE LOANS. CREDIT CARD LOANS AS BECOME THE LARGEST SOURCE OF PERSONAL DATA ASIDE FROM MORTGAGES WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MORTGAGE DEBT HAS ONLY INCREASED THREE POINT 2%. WELL STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS GROWN CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BORROWERS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS AMOUNT WITH THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BORROWERS IN OUR STATE ALONE WE HAVE SEEN THE AVERAGE NATIONAL STUDENT LOAN DEBTS OR 43% BETWEEN. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHAT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS STUDENT LOAN DEBT FROM GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS STUDENT. IN ADDITION A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT MILLENNIALS BEAR THE BRUNT OF THAT BURDEN WAS 75% OF THE GENERATION. HEARING SOME FORM OF COLLEGE DEBT. YET DESPITE THESE ALARMING TRENDS ONLY 56% OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN HAVE STARTED SAVING FOR COLLEGE. CURRENTLY THIRTY FOUR STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OFFER THE RESIDENTS OF FULL OR PARTIAL STATE TAX DEDUCTION. FOR CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN THE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ON FOR OTHER STATES IF WE WERE TO PASS THIS MEASURE -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE SEE A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH TAX INCENTIVES LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS OPEN IN OTHER STATES. MASSACHUSETTS BEING THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE PASSED A ESTABLISH ITS TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HAS SEEN A 52% GROWTH IN ACCOUNTS OPEN SENSE WE HAVE SOME DATA CORRELATING THAT WITH. ACCOUNTS ORE OPEN MEANS MORE STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE GO TO COLLEGE BALL IT STAND TAEJON THAT. THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY WITH UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SEVENTY EIGHT ZERO WE SEE THIS IS COMMON SENSE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THANK YOU SO MUCH MONEY SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANY ITEMS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMUTING GOVERNANCE FINANCE. I'M STANDS IT'LL DEPUTY DIRECTOR DISCLOSURE INVESTMENT FOR WITH MINISTER THIS CULTURE FIVE TWENTY NINE PROGRAM -- THE PLAN. SERVES AS A IMPORTANT VEHICLE FOR FAMILIES SAVING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION -- WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE NOW HAVE -- NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS -- IN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ACCOUNTS AND JUST LAST YEAR WE SAW FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS USED -- FOR BY FAMILIES TO PAY FOR QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES WITH MUCH OF THE FUNDS USED OUT -- USE FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING UC AND CSU CAMPUSES -- AND THEN -- WE ALSO. SEARCH THAT CORRELATES. COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WITH GREATER ECONOMIC [inaudible] OPPORTUNITY -- STUDIES SHOW THAT CHILDREN WITH A COST SAVINGS OF LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR THREE TIMES MORE LIELY. TO ENROLL HIGHER EDUCATION AND FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE THAN THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. ON SO WE FEEL THAT BY OFFERING FAMILIES WILL START TO SAVE OR SAVE MORE. FOR THEIR FUTURE HIGHER SHAKE EDUCATION EXPENSES IN STATES BY TWENTY PLAN WILL BENEFITING. FROM THE TAX ADVANTAGE THE PLAN OFFERS. ANY AMOUNT SAVED WOULD BE LESS FAMILIES WE NEED TO TAKE OUT AND IN STUDENT LOANS.

TWELVE SO IN A SENSE. MUCH OF THE FUNDING THAT'S ALSO BEING PROVIDED FOR THIS BILL. WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE AS MUCH OVERALL FINDINGS WE JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE -- THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE GOING TO EXPAND PROGRAMS TO MAYBE LOOK AT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN MAY BE RE CALIBRATE PRIORITIES. HIGHER TO ADDING THINGS ON TOP BECAUSE THAT WILL THEN MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE OVERALL TO SAY ARE THE EXISTING DEDUCTIONS ARE THE EXISTING TAX CREDITS. ARE THE EXISTING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING AS A STATE OR THEY CONSISTENT WITH YOUR CURRENT VALUES -- AND WE THINK IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MEASURES LIKE THIS SHOULD YOU DO THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO BE IN A POSITION IN THE FUTURE TO NOT. HI BILLS THAT ARE VERY GOOD IDEAS WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR STUDENTS AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AREN'T GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZING THEM [inaudible] WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE GOOD MORNING THE MORNING DOWNLOAD THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE SCTA.

CENTER WHAT FOR SURE SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THIS -- I JUST WANNA CLARIFYA COUPLE THINGS WHEN WE'RE GIVING A DEDUCTION UP FRONT WHICH THE FEDERAL CODE. DOES NOT. SO WERE NONCONFORMITY. SO OVER GIVING A DEDUCTION FRONT EVERY. GOING TO MAKE A TAXABLE WHEN IT IS PULLED. NO -- WE WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT WE WOULDN'T IT RIGHT NOW ALREADY AS IT IS WITH A FIVE FIVE TWENTY NINE CULTURE ACCOUNT. YOU DON'T GET TAXED IN AS LONG AS YOU'RE PULLING IT OUT FOR SPECIFIC EDUCATION PURPOSES AS LONG AS IT'S BEEN PULLED OUT FOR SPECIFIC EDUCATION PURPOSES YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE. TAX ON A BRIGHT RED. THIS IS SORT OF LIKE AN IRA YOU'RE GETTING A DEDUCTION UP FRONT SO WHEN YOU PULL THE MONEY OUT OF AN IRA YOU'RE TAXED ON ON THE WAY OUT. AND SO YOU'RE SAYING. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A TURBO CHARGED THE FEDERAL CODE GIVE A DEDUCTION GOING IN AND NOT. MAKING IT INCOME. WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THAT TRUST CURRENTLY YOU JUST DON'T HAVE TO BE TAXED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT? TRUSTED IS SORT OF A LIKE A ESCROW ACCOUNT. BUT I MEAN I HAVE BRING IN -- JOINT.

ARGUE ABOUT THE STANDING ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT NO I UNDERSTAND BUT WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING A STATE DEDUCTION. BRIDGES AND IT AND SO I I WANT TO FLESH OUT THIS ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING MADE IRONICALLY BY TEACHER REPRESENTATIVE. ON EDUCATION BUT BUT IT'S A BALLOT ARGUMENT AND SO. YOU HAVE THIRTY FOUR OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS AND THEY'RE ALLOWING A DEDUCTION. UP FRONT JUST ON THE STATE WOULD TURN OUT THE FEDERAL BUT JIM ON THE STATE'S AS NONCONFORMING. BUT THEY DON'T REFLECTED AS INCOME WHEN IT'S PULLED OUT OF ITS USE. FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES. IN BFORE YET AGAIN HAVE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF OR TIME BUT I THINK THE OTHER PIECE I'D LIKE TO BE A MENTION AS IN A WAY TO THE END IS THAT.

FOLLOWING THE EIGHTY NINE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SPECIAL LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ CREWS TO MERGE ITS EARLIER REDEVELOPMENT AREAS AND I'LL ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON REBUILDING HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE KEY POLICIES THE CITY ADAPTED FOLLOWING ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE WAS A HOUSING FOR STRATEGY. SINCE RETAILERS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL USES ARE RELUCTANT TO RETURN TO MARKETS DEVASTATED BY NATURAL DISASTER SANTA CRUZ INSTEAD CONCENTRATED ON REPLACING ITS HOUSING FIRST WITH THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO REDEVELOPMENT SANTA CRUZ WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP OVER. THIRTEEN HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOTH WORK FORCE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN TWENTY TWELVE HAS GREATLY IMPACTED OUR CITY'S ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN OUR COMMUNITY SINCE THAT TIME. SINCE THEN SANTA CRUZ HAS BEEN CITED S ONE OF THE LEAST AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKETS IN THE NATION ARE GROWING UC CAMPUS IN NEARBY SILICON VALLEY HAVE BOTH INCREASE THE AFFORDABLE PRESSURE. OF LOCAL HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHAT IS ALSO UNIQUE ABOUT OUR CITY IS THAT WE STILL HAVE-AVAILABLE STAFF TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THE FUNDS PROVIDED THROUGH A BEFORE ELEVEN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS LINED UP IN OUR DOWNTOWN CORE? AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT ON A OF OF THE WORK FORCE. ACT IN OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD AB FOR ELEVEN BE APPROVED WE ALSO HAVE A DOWNTOWN PROJECT WITH A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WITH OUR METRO TRANSIT CENTER. AND A HEALTH CARE AND LOW COST HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL CARE FOR A COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE SANTA CRUZ COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER. DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND FAMILIES. WHAT WE HOPE FOR MAYBE FOUR ELEVEN IS AT THE FUNDING RELEASE BY APPROVAL THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD ON THESE PROJECTS THIRTY SECONDS? THROUGH THESE PROJECTS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AND CONTINUE PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT A BEFORE ELEVEN AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TO MAKE THE TREK TO SEGMENT ALONG WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF SANTA CHRISTINE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GIVEN I WOULD LIKE TO READ A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE FROM AND CITY SANTA CRUZ END OR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT MR DONE.

WOULD LIKE THERE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF PLEASE COME FORWARD. LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. NOW LIKELY TO WELCOME ANYONE WHO MAYBE POST PLEASE COMPORTS GOOD TO SEE YOU WELCOME BACK. SB NATION WE DO APOLOGIZE FOR LATE OPPOSITION WE WEREN'T ABLE TO PROCESS -- A POSITION ON THIS UNTIL RECENTLY AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR BEING VERY UNDERSTANDING AND ACCOMMODATING AS WE WERE COMMUNICATING ON THE ISSUES -- OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS -- IS THE SAME PHILOSOPHICAL OPPOSITION THAT WE HAD MISTER CHAIR TO THE MEASURE THAT BOTH YOU AND CENTER BILL WE'RE WORKING ON SB -- FIVE AND I KNOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HOW WE'RE DOING TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T OPPOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. THE DIFFICULT POSITION THAT WERE PUT IN IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY IS MANY OF THE STRUCTURAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD ON MEASURES SUCH AS THIS -- DO HAVE AN IMPACT ON SCHOOL PROPERTY TAXES AND WHILE AND THERE ARE -- ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE FISCAL IMPACTS BY GENERAL BY BACK FEELING FROM THE GENERAL FUND SHOULD WE GO INTO ANOTHER DECLINE AS WE DID IN THIS PAST RECESSION. AND WE'RE PUTTING HIM IN A POSITION WHERE PROP NINETY EIGHT MAY BE SUSPENDED AGAIN OR THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BACK FILL FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THAT ACTUALLY PUTS THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE. STABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE IN A DOWN ECONOMIC TIME SO WHILE THE ATTEMPT IS TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS -- IS -- OFFERED FOR THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ WHICH WE THINK IS ABSOLUTELY ADMIRABLE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT AGAINST ANY OF THOSE ATTEMPTS WE SIMPLY WANT TO MAKE SURE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE GOING INTO A NAKED AND ECONOMIC ON AN ECONOMIC DECLINE. THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- IN THOSE AREAS ARE ON INTENTIONALLY IMPACTED IN A NEGATIVE WAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU PROTEST MONEY NOW THEY TO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORTH THIS TIME THAT'S CALL. LIKE TURN BACK TO COMMITTEE NOW AND TURN OVER VICE CHAIR THRESHER MORNING RESEARCHER FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK ONE QUESTION FOR REBEL I APPRECIATE THAT. HEY YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD -- FOR CATION BECAUSE I'M. I COME FROM PUBLIC FINANCE AND WHEN YOU TO FEES A BOND IT'S IT'S LIKE SETTING UP AN ORTEZ CURRY PUT BONDS IN TO PAY OFF THE BONTA -- TO SO. IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME WHAT WHAT. WHAT WHAT THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THIS DEFEATS AND SAYS? SO I'M ASSUMING EUROPE'S SIXTY MILLION AND BY PROCEEDS THAT WERE INVESTED SOMEWHERE TO PAY OFF. ANOTHER [inaudible] BOND REQUIRE. SO THAT'S SORT OF LIKE IN AN ESCROW AND AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL THAT MONEY OUT. TO USE IT FOR A GOOD CAUSE BUT YOU'RE BUT YOU'RE PULLING IT OUT. WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR HEAD SO I'M ASSUMING SO FAR I'M I'M OKAY. BUT THEN HOW DO YOU PAY FOR THE ORIGINAL BOND. WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY PAYING FOR WE AN ORIGINAL ISSUANCES ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT FILE OF THE PROCESS DISSOLUTION PROCESS WE DID THE LAST AND FINAL -- AND HAD A FINDING OF COMPLETION AND SO WE HAVE BUILT INTO OUR LAST AND FINAL -- RECOGNIZE OBLIGATION PAYMENT SCHEDULE THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS WE NEED FOR THE BOND SO THIS IS WHAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE -- IT'S FOR THE CITY THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING THROUGH TO THE PASS THROUGH ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDE THE CITY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS IS MONEY THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S NEEDED IN A TO FEES AND SO WE WOULD CONTENT BRIGHT WE WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS AS THEY ARE ANTICIPATED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE OF THE BONDS THAT OUT OF YOUR GENERAL FUND. OUT OF THE REDEVELOPMENT -- TACK TAX INCREMENT THAT WOULD BE COMING THROUGH. OUR BY APOLOGIZE ASSUMING STONE I'D I'D SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS AND YEAH BUT MAYBE A VISUAL PERSON BUT SO SO WE HAVE WE HAVE A THIRTY IN. BUT YOU'VE GOT LIKE. FIFTY ONE MILLION. NO THIRTY FIVE THERE IT THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE WAS THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND THE SIXTEEN MILLION IS WHAT'S LEFT AFTER WE HAVE SCHEDULED OUT THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS SO WE WE CONTINUE TO USE. THE DEBT SERVICE -- THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE SCHEDULED THROUGH OUR ROB TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE GAME PAYMENT SCHEDULE TO CONTINUE TO PAY THOSE IT'S THE BALANCE OF THAT THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. FOR DID THE FEES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WE BOTH HOLD ONTO TO REINVEST INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN WHITE IS THE STATE LAW ALLOW YOU TO HAVE THAT MONEY. ALREADY IT'S PART OF THE REDEVELOPMENT LAW IS THAT DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU WHAT TIME YOU ISSUE THE BONDS YOU ARE AVAILABLE ELIGIBLE TO SPEND A PERCENTAGE OF IT AND THE REST HAS TO BE DO FEES -- TO THE TAXING ENTITIES SO THAT'S JUST WHAT WAS SET UP IN AB ONE AND IT TWENTY SIX AT THE TIME OF THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. AND WE A 100% -- JUST TO CLARIFY A 100% OF THE TIME THAT OF THAT LEGISLATION OF ANY BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREATION COULD BE SPENT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREATION WE HAD A THREE SERIES ISSUES AND ONE ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE SPENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. THE WHAT WE'RE ASKING TODAY IS FOR THE CAPITAL BONDS THE NON AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS TO BE. FOR DOUBLE HOUSING UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION ALL OF THE FOR THE HOUSING BONDS COULD BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITHIN IS MS BAKER'S CONCERN. NOT NOT REALLY WARRANTED THAT THERE'S NO JEOPARDY FOR ANY PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. WELL I I THINK AND I CAN ANSWER THAT FOR THE FUTURE BUT I I THINK FOR THE CLIMATE RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY WERE ALSO ACTUALLY WORKING WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR IF A BEFORE ELEVEN IS APPROVED ACTUALLY SOME OF THE FUNDING WILL BE USED TO CREATE. A AFFORDABLE HOUSING A WORK FORCE HOUSING FOR TEACHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT ON THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU RESEARCHER. YOU WANNA ADD IN ON THAT. THERE ARE A CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE THAT ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO MITIGATE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT -- TO OUR TO LOCAL SCHOOLS -- IN WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT IN THIS THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS TO TRY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR TEACHERS -- AND IF WE COULD GET HIGHER PAY FOR TEACHERS THAN THEY COULD. AFFORD TO LIVE IN COMMUNITIESIN WHICH THEY WORK WE'RE WORKING ON THAT IT'S ON THE LIST OF ITEMS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL PROPERTY. ARE TAX REVENUES FOR SCHOOLS SO IF THAT ISN'T IT. INCOME THAT POCKET ISN'T COMPLETELY FILLED WHILE THE INTENT WOULD BE TO TRY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT MEANS THE SCHOOLS. DON'T HAVE ALL THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD OTHERWISE. THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO KEEP ALL THE TEACHERS AND THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SO UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A CATCH TWENTY TWO SITUATION THAT WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE BEING IN BUT NEVERTHELESS WE'RE HERE TRYING TO AT LEAST TO PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR THE SITUATION SO WE CAN ALL TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATION SENATOR BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION FOR BY SENATOR BELL WE LIKE TURN OVER TO SOMEONE OVER FOR CLOSE. THANK YOU I A DO YOU WANT TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE AND I THINK BASED ON THE DISCUSSION YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE REALLY IS VERY MINIMAL IF ANY. IMPACT ON PROP NINETY EIGHT THE CONCERNS RAISED CLEARLY BY. THEIR ADMISSION ARE SPECULATIVE AND IN THIS CASE WERE NOT BECAUSE OF THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE BENEFITS SCHOOLS BENEFIT TO LOCAL TEACHERS WHO ARE IN FACT SUPPORTING WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE I ASKED ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOMEONE.

THE LAST AND FINAL BILL TODAY HIGH DATING -- MADAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS AB ELEVEN HOME ELEVEN HUNDRED THE FLOOR IS YOURS IN GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY -- I DO WANT TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I AM PRESENTING AB ELEVEN HUNDRED WHICH WILL ALLOW A LINE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODES. BUT LOCAL PARKING ORDINANCES TO SUPPORT ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. IN AB CHARGING STATION IS INSTALLED AT A PARKING SPACE THE% BUILDING CODE DEFINES EXPLICITLY THAT IT IS A CHARGING SPOT AND NO LONGER A PARKING SPOT. SOME LOCALITIES HAVE BEEN INTERPRETING THE LAW TO SAY THAT YOU EITHER NEED ONE OR THE OTHER AND THIS. LAW WOULD CLARIFY AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE LOCALITIES. BUILDING AN ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES OFTEN COSTLIER TECHNICALLY UNFEASIBLE CAUSING CHARGING PROJECTS TO BE DROPPED ENTIRELY WE KNOW THAT SOME MUNICIPALITIES INCLUDING SOME NO MAN SACRAMENTO COUNTIES AND THE CITIES OF STOCKTON IN LA HAVE RECOGNIZE THIS. OR VACATION BUT THIS WOULD MAKE THOSE CLARIFICATIONS STATEWIDE. WE NEED TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACCESS THIS IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN E. VIS. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED HELPS ACHIEVE THIS BY CLARIFYING THAT PARKING STALLS WITH EVEY CHARGING STATIONS CAN STILL COUNT TOWARDS PARKING REQUIREMENTS. AND WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE AND ACCESSIBLE EVEY SPACES TO COUNT AS TWO PARKING SPACES FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH THE PARKING REQUIREMENT. TODAY WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS COREY BULLIS WITH THE ELECTRIC% VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SCRIBBLES ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS DESIGN MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL -- EVEY CHARGING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES MOST OF OUR MEMBERS ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE STATE HAS A GOAL TO DEPLOY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EVEY CHARGING STATIONS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HOWEVER TO DATE WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND WELL SHORT OF OUR GOALS -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT AVAILABILITY OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS KEY TO ACTUALLY INCREASING CONSUMER -- CONFIDENCE IN AN UPTAKE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SCORES OF VIABLE CHARGING PROJECTS EACH YEAR DUE TO THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES OF THE BUILDING CODE RUBBING UP AGAINST -- PARKING COUNTS -- BECAUSE OF THE ADDED CONSTRUCTION COSTS THE PROJECTS JUST DON'T PENCIL OUT ECONOMICALLY. OR IT IS LITERALLY PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH HAVING TO UILD AN ADDITIONAL PARKING SPOT BECAUSE THE SPACE IS COMPLETELY BUILT OUT -- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT UNIQUE TO ONE CITY OR COUNTY IT'S A IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE BUT AS POINTED OUT THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE PASSED ORDINANCES TO FIX THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER THOSE -- THOSE MUNICIPALITIES ARE IN THE MINORITY SO WE'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS A STATEWIDE POLICY AND TO FIX IT FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. THE END RESULT IS MANY PLACES THAT OUR PRIME LOCATION FOR INSTALLING AN EEVEE CHARGING STATION BECOME MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES AND EVEY DRIVERS ACCESS TO MORE CHARGERS TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR STATE GOALS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.
