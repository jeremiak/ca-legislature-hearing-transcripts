NOW FOR MY OPENING REMARKS AND I'LL TURN OVER TO SENATOR- GONZALEZ- SHARING THIS HEARING WITH ME AND ACTUALLY WE SHARE DISTRICTS TO. AND PORTS ON. I CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE MAJOR ECONOMIC ENGINE AND A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF GOOD PAYING JOBS AT THE LOCAL AND STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL. I REPRESENT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES I HAVE BOTH PORTS IN MY DISTRICT THOSE ARE THE TWO LARGEST. IN THE NATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS THESE TWO PORTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FORTY PERCENT. OF THE NATION'S IMPORTS AND 25% OF ITS EXPORTS AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY WE'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT IMPORTS. BUT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT EXPORTS I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. HAS BEEN BEATING ON ME ABOUT THIS TOPIC BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK EXPORTS- WE THINK AGRICULTURAL. AND SHE REPRESENTS A LOT OF AGRICULTURAL LOOKS INTEREST THAT CANNOT GET THEIR GOODS OUT IN A TIMELY FASHION. IT'S ALSO THE BUSINESS SIDE MANUFACTURES ACCENTURE ECCENTRIC THAT EXPORTERS WILL. WHEN OUR PORTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ARE WORKING AS INTENDED THE EFFORT OFTEN GOES UNNOTICED PEOPLE DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT. HOWEVER WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF THE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN. IN CALIFORNIA ARE FOR TO SEE A MAJOR INCREASE IN CARGO VOLUMES WHICH HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT JUST CONGESTION AND STRAIN. EVERY LEVELS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN I MEAN THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS CRISIS. IS THAT PEOPLE STOP BUYING STUFF. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN A SO WE NEED TO RESPOND AND WHEN IT IS FRAUD QUICKLY. THE SHIPS ARE FULL. THE DOCKS ARE FULL AND THE WAREHOUSES ARE FULL. THIS HAS TURNED PUBLIC ATTENTION TOWARDS THE PORTS AND WITH SO MUCH OF OUR NATION'S CARGO FLOWING THROUGH THEM EVERY DAY. THIS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLDWIDE ISSUE. IF YOU LIKE MY CONSTITUENTS LIVE AND WORK NEAR PORTS YOU CAN SEE IT FOR YOURSELF. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF SHIPS IDOLING OFF THE COAST WAITING FOR THEIR TURN TO UNLOAD CARGO. TRUCKS WITH CONTAINERS PARKED ALONG THE ROAD OR IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT BE. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES SHIPS DON'T NEED TO WAIT LONG AT ANCHOR HOWEVER AS OF MONDAY THEY WERE SEVENTY THREE CONTAINER SHIPS AT ANCHOR OR LOITERING. DOWN FROM A HIGH OF SEVENTY NINE IN LATE OCTOBER. WITH SO MANY SHIPS AISLING OFF OUR COAST PORT CONGESTIONHAS BECOME AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM. LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMISSIONS WHICH IS A DETRIMENT IN DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR AIR QUALITY. JUST DRIVE DOWN OCEAN BOULEVARD IN LONG BEACH YOU'LL SEE THE SHIPS OUT THERE CAMPUS ACROSS HIGHWAY GO SOUTH ON THE NEWPORT YOU'LL SEE SHIPS GO OUT TO CATALINA ISLAND. YOU'LL SEE I'M JUST SHARING YOU'LL SEE- SHIPS JUST A COUPLE MILES OFF CATALINA ISLAND SO THE LINE IS LONG. AND IT IS WIDE. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS OFF 50% INCREASE IN CARGO COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF FOURTEEN POINT FIVE TIMES PER DAY OF OXIDES OF NITROGEN. AND POINT TO SEVEN TONS PER DAY OF PARTICULATE MATTER ABOVE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN. NOT GOOD. THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE AMOUNT OF PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE EXHAUST OF NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND CLASS EIGHT. DIESEL TRUCKS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT HAS ONLY INCREASED AS THE NUMBER OF SHIPS IDLING HAS DOUBLED. SINCE MARCH. ON TOP OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES THIS IS ALSO BECOMING AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. AS CONSUMERS FACE SIGNIFICANT DELIVERY DELAYS AND BEGIN TO SEE EMPTY SHELVES AT STORES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE BACKUP IMPACTS EXPORTERS AS WELL AS SOME AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND THEY'RE NOT MAKING IT OUT BEFORE THEY GO BAD WHICH I HAD MENTIONED WHICH I KNOW I'M GONNA LET YOU SPEAK UP BECAUSE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS TOPIC. IF YOU'RE DISTRICT- BUT AGAIN THIS- IT CONGESTION- THE PERSISTENCE BY THE HARD WORK OUR GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY WORKERS BUSH SHOWING GREAT RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED. WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC AND THE SUBSEQUENT SHOCKS TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR WORKERS ON THE DOCKS ON THE SHIPS IN THE WAREHOUSES ARE WORKING HARDER AND LONGER HOURS THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEFORE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THESE WORKERS EVERYONE FROM DOCKWORKERS. DEPORT EMPLOYEES TO TRUCK DRIVERS TO WAREHOUSE WORKERS EVERYONE IN BETWEEN WHO AGAIN I'M WORKING HARDER THAN THEY EVER HAVE. WE ARE HOLDING THIS HEARING SO WE CAN HEAR STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE WHERE THE BOTTLENECKS ARE HAPPENING N THE GROUND AT OUR PORTS AND ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. EXPLORE THE CAUSES DRIVING CONGESTION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ELEVATE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TODAY WE REALLY DON'T NEED TO REDEFINE THE PROBLEM WE WILL HEAR ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE WILL HEAR EXPLAINED OF COURSE. BUT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS BOTH SHORT TERM. AND LONG TERM. FURTHER WE NEED YOUR DIET DIED IN A FIRE WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE STATE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WHAT IS OUR ROLE AND HOW DO WE WORK WITH OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS. THIS CRISIS IN A VERY RAPID MANNER. SOLUTIONS BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE GROUND. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THIS IS A MULTI FACETED PROBLEM AND IT WILL REQUIRE MULTI FACETED ACTION THERE IS NOT ONE SWITCH YOU CAN FLIP. OUR CURRENT CONGESTION CRISIS WAS CAUSED BY A PERFECT STORM OF FACTORS FROM INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND TO COVERT NINETEEN SHUT DOWNS TO A LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. LIKE ON DOCK RAIL AND STORAGE SPACE TO ASSURE SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE MATERIALS LIKE CHASSIS AND CONTAINERS THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT BE GOING AWAY ON ITS OWN. WITH CONSTRUCTION CONGESTION EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO NEXT YEAR. SOLVING THIS CRISIS AND PREVENTING FUTURE DISRUPTIONS WILL TAKE A RESPONSE FROM ALL LEVELS OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. AND GOVERNMENT. I KNOW I HAVE MY OWN IDEAS BUT REALLY THIS IS TO HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS I'VE RECEIVED CALLS FROM THE PRESS A WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING OTHER WEATHER SOLUTIONS I HAVEN'T JOHNSON SAID THESE ARE THE SOLUTIONS NOW WHAT I'M HEARING AS I'M HEARING WHEN HIS SWEEPER SHIPS TO GET THE EMPTIES OUT OF THE PORTS. ON HEARING THAT THE PORTS ARE GONNA NEED MORE LAND WEATHER'S INSIDE PORT FOUNDERS ARE OUTSIDE COUNTERPART ANDREAS THAT'LL BE UP A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND THE CHASSIS SO MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET IT THIS CHASSIS IS A THAT'S THE CARRIAGE AND THE WHEELS THAT CARRIES A CONTAINER THERE IS A MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF THOSE. SO IN THE SHORT TERM THAT'S LIKELY WHAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT TODAY SO I ROOM REALLY INTERESTED HERE ABOUT THOSE THREE AREAS AND OTHERS THAT THEY EXPERTS WILL BRING UP MAKE US EXPERTS TODAY THAT'S WHAT I ASK OF YOU. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND FROM THE FEDERAL STATE IS FEDERAL STATE AND FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS AND THE GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY. AND AGAIN. OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY. OUR ROLE TODAY AS LEGISLATORS IS TO LISTEN TO THESE INDUSTRY EXPERTS. AND HEAR THEIR PERSPECTIVE. ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST IN EASING. CONGESTION AND STRENGTHENING. OUR SUPPLY CHAIN.

CARGO MOVING TO THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH EVERY YEAR NOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND THERE NEED TO BE A SENSE OF URGENCY- CONSUMER DEMAND HAS INCREASED- AND WE HAVE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS- THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THIS CRISIS AS MUCH BEFORE STRETCHES BEYOND REPORTS- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FARMERS ARE SUFFERING. ARE STATES RENT RENOWNED AG PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING EXPORTED AS THEY WOULD IN A NORMAL YEAR IN FACT FARMERS ARE SEEING A OPPORTUNITIES. AND AN ESTIMATED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CARGO IS IDLING ON THE COAST WAITING TO UNLOAD WITH THE HOLIDAYS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER CHRISTMAS IN THE MONTHS BEYOND MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND AS WE SEE WITH ALL WITH AS WE CAN SEE WITH ALL THOSE ON THE AGENDA AND THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE FROM RETAILERS TO PORTS TRANSPORTATION LABOR THERE'S SO MANY COMPONENTS IN INDUSTRIES INVOLVED AND WE NEED URGENT ACTION AND COLLABORATION NOT JUST IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS BUT TO FIND LONG TERM STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS. TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING ECONOMY. AND WORKFORCE WE MUST ALSO- REEVA. THE POLICY- AND RULES. IN PLACE. SOME OF THEM PUT IN PLACE TO BUY- SACRAMENTO. THAT HAS MADE THIS CRISIS WORSE.

AND EVERY DAY SHIPS ARE ANCHORED WAITED TO UNLOAD AT WE CONTINUE TO POLLUTE OUR AIR STYMIE OUR ECONOMY AND HIBBETT OUR WORKERS FROM ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD DAY OF WORK A LOT MORE TRUCKS AND MORE TRAINS TO UNLOAD ON THE SHIPS AND ALSO THAT MEANS MORE DIESEL BURNED AND EMISSIONS WHICH HAVE A COST TO THEM. THAT'S WHY I'M HOPING DEARLY THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND WHICH IS EXPERIENCING A 50% CAPACITY RIGHT NOW HAS THE ABILITY TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION WHICH HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE WORK FORCE TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE SUPPLY CHAIN BACKLOG LIMITING THE IDOLING AND ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS THAT COME COMMUNITIES AND THE LA AND LONG BEACH ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW SO TODAY WHILE I OBSERVE THE CHALLENGE AND LISTEN FOR ANSWERS I DO SO WITH AN EYE TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITIES AND ENSURING THAT OAKLAND AND THE PORT OF OAKLAND ARE A PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND ENSURING WE DON'T COMPOUND ECONOMIC INJUSTICES WITH FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ONES.

WHICH HAS- SERVICE MANY OF THE EXPORT AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES WE ARE FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT- EXPORT IMPORT PORT. SO THE EXPORTERS. AMY IS FELT ACUTELY SO I JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THESE THAT KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY ISSUES THAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS APPOINTED OUT. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM APPOINT THE NATION INCLUDING THREE OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORTS AND A DIVERSE ASSEMBLY SPECIALTY PORTS. ELEVEN PORT AUTHORITIES ARE COMPRISED THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION PORT AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING 40% OF THE CONTAINERIZED. IMPORTS AND 30% OF ALL EXPORTS IN THE NATION. US CONSUMER DEMAND START ROCKET THE CONTAINER AND CARGO PORTS COMBINED AT FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF HISTORIC VOLUMES WE'RE DOING THE JOB. BUT WE NEED TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES OF RESILIENCY IN THE TIMES OF EXTRAORDINARY. CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE MEANTIME OUR CREWS A VISITOR ORIENTED PORTS AS WELL AS OTHER ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO RECOVER WHEN I DROP POPPING DEMAND. THE PROLEM IS THAT THE WALL STATED BY ASSEMBLY PERSONAL DONALD MEMBERS TO COMMITTEES I WON'T REHASH THOSE DISCHARGING CARGO MATE THE PAST TWO YEARS OVERALL AMONG THE BUSIEST HIS EIGHT YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA POINTS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY AGAIN ACUTE AMOUNT THE WITH THOSE WORKING THE STATE'S AGRICULTURAL EXPORT COMMUNITIES. THE SITUATION GET RIGHTFULLY DEMANDS INCREASED COLLABORATION COOPERATION A SOLUTIONS FOR ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. ALL PRIVATE SECTOR SAKEHOLDERS. ALL OF THE BLANKS IN ITS SUPPLY CHAIN. IT ALSO OFFERS LESSONS ABOUT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. AND AS YOU KNOW THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES INVENSYS SEEM TO BECOME THE ORDINARY. RECENTLY CATHOLIC GOING TO SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS SUMMIT ADVISING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE BUSINESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND I'D LIKE TO THANK- DIRECTOR- CANAL FOR HAVING CONVENE THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK ON SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. OPERATIONALLY HAPPEN MEMBER PORTS HAVE PRO PRO ACTIVELY TAKEN STEPS TO ALLEVIATE SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION. IT IS STEPS UP INCLUDED CREATING POLICIES THAT INCENTIVIZE TURN TIMES TO MAKE SURE IT TOO MANY TIMES A QUICK AND YOUR TRANSACTIONS SO WHEN A TRUCK IT'S FULL IN WITH- TO TWO WITH A CAGR LOW THE GLOW CARGO FOR EXPORT AS WELL AS GO OUT. WITH THE IMPORT CARGO TO ELECT. IMPLEMENTED BEST PRACTICES IN SHORT IT IS A BETTER USE OF CAR HELLO CAPACITY USE. OF EXISTING TRUCK GATES APPOINTMENTS. WELL CARGO- OWNERS BY. GATE AT. PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION. SO THAT WE INCLUDE WE IMPROVE CARGO VELOCITY AND EFFICIENCY. EXTENDING ATE HOURS AT CERTAIN PORT TERMINALS WHERE NEEDED TO EVALUATE ITS IMPACT ON RELIEVING CONGESTION. SO WE ARE TAKING A SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS NONETHELESS THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COORDINATION EFFORTS AMONG PRIVATE FINANCING PARTNERS. THANK YOU STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. HELLO CALIFORNIA PORTS ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA BOARDS DPC ACCESS THE FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE FUNDS IN THE STATE BUDGET CYCLE THE GUIDELINES BUT IT TO A SMALL GROUP OF PORTS BUT DIRECT pWHICH MIGHT ADDRESS GREAT CONGESTION. AND IN WHAT WE TALK ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS ONE OF THOSE HAS TO BE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. THE CURRENT CONGESTION THAT WE SEE IS PARTLY A RESULT OF DECADES OF UNDER INVESTMENT IN ALL PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT SUPPLY CHAIN. THIS IS A BIGGER NOTABLY THERE ISN'T NEARLY ELEVEN TO ONE. I DON'T TRANSPORTATION A WATERSIDE SPENDING A POOR COMPLEXES AROUND THE COUNTRY VERSUS BOTH MATING CURING CALIFORNIA. IT IS A PATTERN IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STATES INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA HAVE BIG ALL SPENDING US IN CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY MANY STATES TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE FOR CARGO TRADITIONALLY HAS COME TO CALIFORNIA PORTS ALONG WITH THE JOBS AND ECONOMIC VITALITY THAT COMES WITH. OUR CREW DEDICATED EVERY CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THEIR HOME PORTS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I WE WILL HOPE TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION. IS A- ASSISTANT INVESTMENT IN OUR PORTS IN CALIFORNIA. AS MANY OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ARE GLOBAL AND HAVE OVERLAPPING AREAS OF FEDERAL JURISDICTION WE APPLAUD THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY A FEDERAL AND STATE TRANSPORTATION PARTNERS FOR ENHANCE COLLABORATION ON DELPHINUS SUPPORTING KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT CAN HELP TO SPEED UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL SHORT TERM MEDIUM TO LONG TERM INITIATIVES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN HELP TO ADVANCE THE SOLUTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. FIRST ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVISE ALL THE SUPPLIES YOU PARTNERS UTILIZED AND MAXIMIZED CAPACITY IN ALL TRADE GATEWAYS. I'M A AND- THE IDEA AND- I THINK I JUST ON ONE SLIDE TO SHOW YOU TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT. AND IF I MAY. C. OKAY. WELL AS EXPECTED I'M NOT FINDING THIS SITE BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF THE- TERMINAL OPERATORS IN OAKLAND LAST WEEK. THIS IS AMAZING TO ME AS I SAID AT THE TERMINAL CARE ACT TERMINAL. YOU LOOK ON THE BAY AND THE WHOLE TIME I WAS ENERGY. ENERGY OF CONTAINERS AND YOUR SHIPS AND THE OPERATOR TELLS ME THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR HISTORY OR THEIR OPERATING OAKLAND THT THEY HAVE NOT HAD ONE VESSEL CALL. SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN DICTATING IN THIS KIND OF A MARKET DISTORTION. ALL THE SUPPLY IN THE CARGO IS NOW MOVING THROUGH OUR A LOT I'M NOT ALL THAT A NOT LOT OF THE- SHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN CALLING PORTABLE CONTENT NOW SKIPPING THAT PORT. AND PUTTING THAT CARGO IN NOW IN LONG BEACH. THIS ASSEMBLY PERSONS- POINTED OUT THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION. ALL RIGHT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS HEALTHY TO ENCOURAGE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS REALIZE A MAXIMUM CAPACITY. IN ALL THE TRADE GATEWAYS. NEXT ADVICE. STATION PROPERTIES WHAT TEMPORARY. STORAGE IN ADDITION TO LOSING THE RESTRICTIONS OF HYPING. OFF TEMPORARY STORAGE. WE HAVE THAT THE STATE'S COOPER. IDENTIFY PROPERTIES FOR THIS KIND OF TALK A CRISIS FOR STORAGE. NEXT SUPPORT EXEMPTIONS FOR PURCHASE OF WARM HSCS INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF KEY EQUIPMENT USE THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ONE OF THE ISSUES OF SUPPLY CHASSIS SHORTAGE IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE LACK OF- SUPPLY CURRENTLY PHONE FORM A CHASSIS. EVEN THOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT MADE AMERICA IS AN OBJECTIVE AT THIS TIME WE BOUGHT THAT CHASSIS IS TO BE MADE AND SHIPPED OVER TO EUROPE FOR SUPPLY. THANKS CONVENING A SUPPLY CHAIN OF RG GROUP WITH THIRD PARTY STAKEHOLDERS THAT DEDICATED POINT PERSON. A DEDICATED PERSON WITHIN A STATE LEADERSHIP TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CALIFORNIA FRENCH POLICY THAT CAN IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL LEVERS TO EACH CONTRACTIONS IN TIME OF CRISIS. YES WE NEED TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A ROLL OUT WORKFORCE TRAINING INITIATIVES IN INCREASING THE PIPELINE FOR SKILLED LABOR THIS IS A SUPPLY CHAIN WORKFORCE JOBS. ALSO WE NEED TO DESIGNATE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DATA SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTING A PILOT PROJECTS TO CREATE MORE VISIBILITY. AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPL CHAIN WHAT NEED MORE DATA PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE CARGO IS AT ANY TIME. ADD OR THAT CONNECTION IS MADE RIGHT NOW ALL THE INFORMATION IS NOT TRANSPARENT WE NEED SOME KIND OF BEST MUCH INTO THAT DATA AND ONE THAT'S UNIFORM ACROSS THE PORTS. CREATE A SUPPLY CHAIN INVESTMENT FUND THEY CAN ALSO BE USED. QUICKLY LIKE CHASSIS SOME CONTAINERS AND A SHORT TERM. AND ADVANCE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN LONG TERM. ONE OF THOSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AS ON THE ASSEMBLY PERSONS POINTED OUT IS INTRODUCTION OF EMISSIONS WE NEED ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURES THE PORTS WE NEED- IT INFRASTRUCTURE DATA WAREHOUSING THE CLOSER TO THE SOURCE OF THESE CARGO. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF INVESTMENT WE NEED. IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THESE PRESSING ISSUES WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES AS WE DRESS OUR PART IN THE GLOBAL CONGESTION CHALLENGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR ONE OF PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MR ONE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES OFFER THE KIND OF BIG PICTURE THE OVERVIEW AND POTENTIALLY SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS DO WE HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS FROM A MEMBER CENTER. YES THANK YOU PRESIDENT ONE FOR YOUR- YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW- OF THAT ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY OF KAPPA KAPPA. I'M JUST A QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE MAX CAPACITY AVERAGE- FOR I KNOW PORT OF LA LONG BEACH SEEMS TO BE HIRED- POTENTIALLY THAN THE OTHER NINE- PORTS BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW. CAN WE ENSURE THAT- IF THERE ARE- IF THERE IS A CARGO COMING IN TO PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH THAT THEY CAN POTENTIALLY STAY IN CALIFORNIA- PORTS. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOGISTICAL SORT OF ISSUES WITH THAT- REGARDING RELATIONSHIPS AND SIZE OF SHIPS BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT. COULD BE DISCUSSED IN THAT IN THAT SPACE. ABSOLUTELY THE GOAL IS TO- ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO KEEP A CARGO COMINGTO CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO KEEP THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTAINERS I ENTITIES FOR EXPORTERS TO PUT THEIR CARGO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE CARDINAL INTO THOSE CONTENTIOUS TO ASIA. SO THAT'S OUR GOAL YOU AND CALIFORNIA PORTS. WHAT CURRENTLY IS HAPPENING IS THAT SOME OF THE CARGOES BEING DIVERTED OF COURSE TO. OTHER NON CALIFORNIA PORTS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- SO THAT'S A DISTURBING TREND. BUT SECONDLY I DID CURRENTLY. SO I GUESS SAID THE PRICE DISTORTION IS SUCH THAT. THE CARGO A COMMANDING SUCH PRICES THAT IS IT IS- PROBABLY INCENTIVIZING. THE FAST MOVEMENTS. OF FAST MOVING THE CARGO TURN AROUND TO GO BACK TO ASIA. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS SOME OF THOSE SHIPS IT SHIPPING LINES SO USED TO CALL L. A. LONG BEACH FIRST. THE DROP OF KAGEL DESIGNATED FOR THAT POOR AND THEN GOLD IN OAKLAND THE JUDGE DROPPED OFF A CARD OVER THAT PORT AND IMPORTANTLY PICK UP EXPORTS. FROM THE AG EXPO- INDUSTRY WILL GO BACK TO ASIA. NOW WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO NOW THEY'RE DOING IS SIMPLY DROPPING OFF THE CAR THE L. IN LONG BEACH. ALL THE CLUB EVEN THOSE THAT USED TO BE. SHIPPED TO OAKLAND AND THEN GOING BACK TO ASIA DIRECTLY BUT THAT'S CAUSING IS OF COURSE ADDING TO THE CONGESTION IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PETER PORTS. AND EVEN CAPACITY WANTING IN OAKLAND AND AS WE HEARD FONG STOPPED IN OTHER PORTS. INDICATE ANY ASSOCIATION. HAS A CAPACITY YOU. CURRENTLY OAKLAND HOW. I THINK TWENTY BY PERCENT BUT THEY CAPACITY WE COULD. ACCOMMODATE TO HELP RELIEVE THE CONGESTION AT THE ST PEDRO COURTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHONE. I THINK YOU ARE THE PRESENT ONE- I WANTED TO DIVE INTO A PART OF YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT OTHER STATES HAVE INVESTED IN THEIR PORTS- TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY- I WONDER IF YOU CAN- TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE SPECIFICS WHAT HAVE OTHER STATES DONE- IN THEIR INVESTMENTS AND I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PORTS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED- THE FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL. AND IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA PORTS- WHAT PROJECTS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO- INVEST IN TO ALLEVIATE THE CONGESTION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I'M SURE THIS- OTHER. FOLKS TESTIFYING AFTER ME WILL BE GOING TO THIS ISSUE. BUT IMPORTANTLY AS WE SAID IT AS I STATED EVEN BEFORE THE ADAMIC WHAT IS STOPPING THAT- THERE ISN'T MUCH BETTER I SHOULD I DON'T KNOW BETTER THE WORD BUT CERTAINLY MUCH MORE EMPHASIS. ON COORDINATED BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS INVESTMENT IN THEIR PORTS INFRASTRUCTURE. IN TERMS OF- SORT OF AND MARKETING AND- MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A- COORDINATED WAY OF HANDLING THE- IN ADDITION GROWTH FOR THE PORTS. AND YOU KNOW THAT IN- THE PRAMANA BUT NOW I'M A GIRL ALL POLL FOR EXAMPLE IN. GEORGIA IN VIRGINIA ON THE FLORIDA AS WELL AS TEXAS. SO THAT INVESTMENT I GUESS I STATED MY TESTIMONY THERE'S A NEARLY ELEVEN TO ONE IMBALANCE BETWEEN WHAT'S THE INVESTMENT THAT'S MADE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER STATES THAT I MENTIONED SO THAT IMBALANCE IT HAS TO BE CORRECTED I THINK WE THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED. THE ISSUE IS ARE WE NEED TO HAVE A STATE LEVEL COORDINATION. OF FOR FREIGHT POLICY THAT GIVES INVESTMENT IN PORTS. THAT'S IMPORTANT NOW WHAT I NAME STANDS UP. I JUST OPENED IT IS AMPLE AND SHOW THE OTHER BOARD DIRECTORS WAS TO SAY THEIR OWN- THAT IS WE ARE TRYING TO EXACT FOR ELECTRIFY PORTS. FIND TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS ONE OF THOSE HAS TO BE INVESTMENT IN OUR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE JUST SUPPLIED PARTS. AS WELL AS WE STATED WE NEED MORE- SPACE. AND WE ALSO NEED INVEST IN TURN OF- INLAND PORT YOU KNOW WORDS THAT HAVE. TWO MODELS AVAILABLE ENGLAND OF THE SO THEY WE CAN OUT. AND HAVE TO PRY IT AT THE STORE. I DOLLARS BY SHIP BY RAY- INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE- WE CAN PROCESS SOME OF THOSE CARGO INLAND UP ON THE PORCH ITSELF SO AGAIN- THIS KIND OF RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE- BADLY. SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN ACT AS WANT TO MAKE SURE I WROTE THIS DOWN CORRECTLY SO YOU SAID THERE'S ELEVEN AND ELEVEN TO ONE AND BALLOTS SO FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST OTHER STATES INVEST ELEVEN DOLLARS- IN THERE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT AND STATE. COMBINED NOT JUST EIGHT ZERO ZERO ZERO YEAH THE SOAPS OF THE TOTAL INVESTMENT SO OTHER STATES SPEND ELEVEN TIMES MORE THAN WE DO ON THE POOR INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT SAYS SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS. CAN YOU YOU'VE I KNOW MY THAT MY LAST QUESTION I GUESS IS- YOU MENTIONED ADDITIONAL COORDINATION- MULTIPLE TIMES. WHO WOULD BE THE ONE COORDINATING WOULD BE IT WOULD IT WOULD WHO WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION THIS COORDINATION RIGHT NOW I THINK EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION BUT WHEN WE GET TO BRASS TACKS HOW DOES THIS FUNCTION HOW DOES IT WORK WHO WHO DO YOU ENVISION A WHAT YOU ENVISION. TO BE COORDINATING. AND THIS IS A- THIS IS. A QUESTION THESE DAYS. IS THAT WE ARE DISCOVERING THIS KIND OF CRISIS. THE WHO IS THE COORDINATOR. IS THE BIG QUESTION- WE TALK ABOUT A SUPPLY CHAIN. IT IS A IT IS EVEN CHANGING IMAGINE THE LINKS INTO TALKING SOMETIMES DON'T CONNECT EACH YEAR THE VERY WELL. AND BY WHO IS ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO OTHER. I THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT I THINK WE NEED TO SOLVE AND THAT'S WHY ONE OF OUR SUGGESTIONS. IS THAT WE DO NEED A STATE. LEADERSHIP WITHIN NEED A POINT TO PERSON. OR VIæT GROUP THAT WILL FIGURE TO HELP US FIGURES OUT WHAT IS THE COORDINATION SYSTEM. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE HAVE MADE IS THAT. NUMBER ONE WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY IT BEFORE WE CAN COORDINATE ANYTHING. WE NEED A SYSTEM WHICH THERE'S- CLARITY. AS TO IF I AM A CARGO OWNER. WHERE IS MY COULD CONTAIN A CARGO. IF I'M UP FOR THOÁT HOW DO I KNOW WHEN. THE CAR GOES COMING IN. AND WHEN YOU SHIP SUPPORT OUT. AND IS A REGULAR SCHEDULE THAT'S ABOUT IT ALL THIS SO. OF THE INFORMATION IS NUMBER ONE STEP. IN TERMS OF I CHIANG BUT NOW TWO WE DO NEED ACCORDING EFFORT. TO ASK YOUR QUESTION. WHO IS THE- OF ALL THE SYSTEM. SO I WAS ONE LAST QUESTION BASED ON THAT EACH. WEEK AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT AND I THINK THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED THIS TO- AND MULTIPLE AT MULTIPLE TIMES. THERE HAS TO BE A SENSE OF URGENCY- SO WHO'S COORDINATING NOW. AND WHAT GAPS EXIST I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN. A LOT OF TIMES. RIGHT NOW THE VISUAL IS ALL OF THE BOATS IN THE CARGO SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. BUT EVEN IF WE REMOVED ALL THE CONTAINERS OFF THOSE BOATS THERE ARE STILL MULTIPLE CHECKPOINTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN. SO WHO'S COORDINATING NOW HOW IS IT FUNCTIONING NOW SHOULD THERE BE MORE ACTIVITY. FROM FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD THERE BE MORE ACTIVITY FROM- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHO WHO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. YEAH WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS A GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM- THE BY THE MINISTRATION OUR PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED EIGHT POINT PERSON WITHIN THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY. TO COURT INDICTS A- I HOPE- I JUMP THE CAR. MISTER JUMPING EIGHT IS BEING POINT TO REALLY HELP COORDINATE AMONG. THE VERY PLAYERS AND USING HIS THE PRESIDENT'S POINT HOPE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER ARE COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS. SOME OTHER SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS I MENTIONED. IN MY TESTIMONY IN FACT HAS COME OUT OF THAT DISCUSSION WITH MR PICARDO SO THAT IS A FEDERAL EFFORT TO COORDINATE THESE THINGS. BUT YOU KNOW LONG TERM HOWEVER WE DO NEED A SPECIAL IN CALIFORNIA IS IN VIEWING OURSELVES AS A COMPETITIVE. A PLAYER WITH OTHER STATES WE DO NEED BETTER COORDINATION AMONG JUST. ONE IMPORTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN HERE. I THINK MY- THANK YOU THANK YOU AND JUST JUST BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT THE AMOUNTS THE ELEVEN TO ONE RATIO. I THINK WHAT HE WAS INCLUDING THERE AND I CAN HIGHLIGHT AS ONE EXAMPLE IS THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE FEE RIGHT. PORT USERS PANDA THAT AND THEN IT'S PUT OUT TO IMPROVE PORTS ACROSS THE NATION BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT AT ALL GET ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE HE ACTUALLY GOES. TO IMPROVE SOME MUCH SMALLER PORTS TO AND WE DON'T GET ENOUGH THERE'S A HUGE BALANCER NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THAT'S REALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THAT SENATOR EGGMAN HAS JOINED US THANK YOU SENATOR. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE'S A NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY I'M THINKING FOR THE PRESENTATION- SO I REPRESENT MYSELF IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REPRESENT STOCK IMPORT THE LARGEST AND IMPORTANT WESTERN HEMISPHERE WE LIKE TO SAY- AND OF COURSE THAT WE'VE HAD A RECORD YEAR THIS YEAR IN BEING ABLE TO HANDLE SOME OF THE- THE SHIPS THAT ARE COMING IN. BUT I GUESS SOME OF MY QUESTIONS AROUND AND AT THAT HEY LET ME JUST SAY I THINK I CONCUR WITH A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I'M A LITTLE BIT HORRIFIED THAT WE DON'T HAVE. BETTER SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE LIKE YOU KIND OF VISUALIZE IS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER PERSON OUT THERE DOING DIRECTING BUT I GUESS I GUESS WERE I GUESS EVERYBODY'S KIND OF DOING THE CONTRACTING ON THEIR OWN WHICH WHICH I MEAN AND THEN WE THEN WE UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- BUT MY QUESTION MY POINT IS WHILE IT CANNOT MAY PERHAPS HELP WITH THE CONGESTION RIGHT NOW. BEING ABLE TO DIRECT AS MANY- CONTAINERS YOU CAN TO SOME OF THE SMALLER PORTS LIKE HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN AND AROUND THE STOCK IMPORT THAT DEBT THAT SHIPPING IS GOING TO CHANGE RIGHT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE BIG TWENTY TWENTY. THIS CONTAINER THAT ARE GOING TO GO DOWN TO LIKE TWO THOUSAND WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE ENOUGH THAT WE'RE SEEING HAPPENING ALREADY- AND THEN EVERY EVERY SMALLER CONTAINER WE TAKE INTO STOCKTON IS TWO THOUSAND TRUCKS THAT WERE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD SO WE'RE WE'RE MEETING A LOT OF GOALS AT THE SAME TIME. AND WE KNOW THAT WE I MEAN WE HAVE THE SPACE WE HAVE THE CRANES WE HAVE THE LABOR WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS A CUSTOM BORDERS TO BE ABLE TO- CHECKPOINTS TO BE ABLE TO SCAN THE MATERIAL THAT'S COMING IN WE KNOW IS A BIG PART. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE SOME OF THE MORE INLAND PORTS WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER- SHIPS THAT ARE THAT ARE ALREADY BEING ON ORDER TO BE CREATED SO WE KNOW THAT'S COMING SO IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE GET THIS COORDINATION PIECE DOWN. I WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN TO INCREASE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE GOODS- AND MAKE A MAKE SURE THEY'VE THEY'VE MOVE. SAMLESSLY AS- AND HOW IS THIS A CONSIDER. IF IT IS. THIS IS A QUESTION DIRECTED ME I SHOULD WRITE JEFF. OKAY YES I SURE AGAIN MY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL AND- I. I'D SHORT ANSWER IS WE NEED THAT INVESTMENT BAD FOR STOCK AND CERTAINLY HAS WAGED A ROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND IN TERMS OF FUTURE PLANNING- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF BOTH INLAND- WATER PORTS AND AS WELL AS INLAND LAN PORTS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE INVESTED. AND DOT RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE- IT WE HAVE EXPLORED IN THE PAST IT'S SORT OF A- AND- STAY- IN- ROUTE USED IN BUT AGAIN THE- HAS BEEN INVESTMENT INCENTIVISING DOT MAKING IT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. I ENJOY IS A LAN LAN PORTS WE NEED THE RAILROADS TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT TO MAKE SURE THE DATE BY INTO THE CONCEPT OF RATHER THAN JUST CALLING LONG TRIP LONG ROUTES ALSO SHORT ROUTES. ALSO A CUSTOMS A FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN CUSTOMS. FACILITIES IN BOTH- PUTS LIKE STOCKTON I TO MAKE SURE THAT'S FEASIBLE FOR- TOWARDS. SUCH A STOCKTON TO OPERATE INTERNATIONAL CARGO AS THOSE ARE ALL KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND- SUPPLY AND LABOR AND COULD THE JUST TO GO ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO INVEST AND TO RETURN TO GHANA CONCEPT YOU MENTION ASSEMBLY. PERSON SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WOULD JUST THE TO ALL OF US WHO HAVE POURED ARE GOING LET'S NOT JUST TRY TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS LET'S MAKE A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE SO WE DON'T. END UP HERE AGAIN I THINK A GREAT POINT WELL TAKEN- AGUIAR-CURRY. YEAH THANK YOU. MR ONE- ARE YOU CURRENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CARRIERS TO INCREASE CALLS TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND. AND HAVE EVEN COMMITTED TO COME BACK YET. AND HOW MUCH- VOLUME IS OAKLAND DOWN IN EXPORT SHIPPING. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YES WERE ABSOLUTELY- WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONFERENCE BUT WE'VE NOT ONLY PRIVATELY YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THIS AND THAT THE SHIPPING LINES ABOUT- COORDINATING THE SCHEDULE SO THAT THEY CAN CALL ME AND THEY HAVE A SEAMLESS. EXPERIENCE AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND- AND WE HAVE SEVERAL CARRIERS HAVE NOW STARTING TO RESUME NOT ONLY THE CALLS AT PORT BUT LSO STARTING SOME WHAT WE CALL DIRECT SERVICE IN OTHER WORDS TAKING SMALLER SHIPS. AND CALLING CALLING TO OAKLAND AND THEN JUST GOING BACK. WITHOUT SERVICING OTHER PORTS SO DIRECTIONAL VERSUS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE ARE TALKING TO THE SHIPPING LINES ABOUT- AND ALL THAT IS THE DOT EFFORT. TO RELIEVE THE ACOG GESTIONES IN OTHER UP PORTS SO- SOME OF THAT IS RETURNING. AND BUT- NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE AND WE ALL CONTINUE THE EFFORT- RIGHT NOW LIKE I SAID WE ARE WE HAVE PLAYED THE ENTIRETY IF WE SAY A WHERE POPPI A. 75% RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T. NOW JUST A- JUST THIS. THE IS NOT IS. TO THE CONGESTION THAT I OWN LONG BEACH IN THE HOLD BECAUSE WE SUPPORT THE SIZE OF PULGAS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BE THE ALL THE CONGESTION THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH. AT LEAST THE CARGO DESTINED FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA UTAH NEVADA SHOULD COME TO THE PORTABLE CAN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE CARGO THAT- THAT ANTI SHOULD BE FILLED WITH EXPORTS BEFORE THE EXIT- CALIFORNIA ABOUT TO EXPIRE. SO WE ARE TALKING AND AGAIN JUDICIAL COORDINATION WE'RE TRYING TO PLAYED A ROLE COORDINATOR TO MAKE SURE ALL THE CHANGES. ARE LINED UP SO THAT WHEN THEY DO CALL PORTABLE CAN. THAT DOES NOT CAUSE FURTHER CONGESTION. WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MY AGRICULTURAL FRIENDS OR WONDER WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE NEXT THIRTY SIXTY NINETY DAYS- YOU KNOW IF YOU GET DOWN PERFECT LONGER OUT BUT- TO HELP ERASE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IN GETTING THESE EXPORTS UP- WE MISSED A- PRIME TIME- A PRODUCT GOING TO. A SOUTHEAST ASIA AND INDIA. AND SO- THE HIT ON THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT WHEN WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER LATER TODAY SO- THE EXPORT PIECE I'M REALLY GLAD WE'RE ADDRESSING TODAY. AND I'M NOT I'M GOING TO DRILL IT INTO EVERYBODY THE SENSE OF URGENCY. AND THE SENSE OF NOT FORGETTING AGRICULTURE MAKING SURE WE GET OUR EXPORTS UP THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY AND I JUST. NOT TO DEFEND THE CURRENT PRACTICE OR ANY COMPANY OUT THERE BUT I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT. IF YOU'RE TARGETED CAP OR SOME COMPANY- IF YOU IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST TAKING A SHIP. TO OAKLAND RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A SHIPPING COMPANY THAT'S THE BOAT RIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TERMINAL OPERATOR THAT'S WHERE YOU. THAT'S THE DOC. RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A TRUCKING COMPANY RELATIONSHIP A WORKHOUSE RELATIONSHIP AND EVEN SOME OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AT ALL REQUIRES LEGAL CONTRACTS THAT JUST TAKES TIME SO YOU JUST CAN'T TURN ON A DIME SAY HEY. TAKE A BOAT SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE CONTAINERS. BECAUSE THERE HAS TO BE A LOT OF. RELATIONSHIPS ARE THERE- MANY OF THEM LEGAL. WITH THAT ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISH TO COMMENT- AS BONTA. THANK YOU CHAIR IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU MISTER ON- AT MY QUESTION IS I KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT THE PORT OF OAKLAND JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE DID HAVE SOME OVERAGE IN TERMS OF THE CONCERT CONGESTION BACK IN THE SPRING AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT WAS AN INVESTMENT IN INCREASING WORKFORCE AT THE DOCK TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO JUST FOR WAY OF EXPLANATION TO BE ABLE TO. OFFER UP ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOLUTION IT INVESTMENT IN WORKFORCE AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE KINDS OF BOTH TRUCKERS AND DOCKWORKERS THAT ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CAN YOU SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE SOME OAKLAND ALREADY INSTITUTED AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER. IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE. ASSEMBLY PERSON THANK YOU. IT IS INDEED TRUE JOY- WHEN- WENDY SHIPS- OR IN THEIR NORMAL- CALLING ORDER THEY CALL OAKLAND. WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS A LONG SHORT- LABOR SKILLED LABOR SHORTAGE AT THE DOCK AND THERE WAS A CONGESTION. AND THAT SINCE THAT INTO SHORT TERM. THE LONG SHORT AND IF YOU MAY HAVE- A RAMPED UP THEIR TRAINING OF SKILLED LABOR AT THE AGE. OF THE DOCK AND DODD IS NOW- SOMEWHAT DATA RESULT SO BUT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY PERSON POINT IS WELL TAKEN ONE OF THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO MEET ENTERS THROUGH SINCE. GOT WE- WE MUST FOCUS ON. IS THE SHORTAGE OF TRUCKERS SHORTAGES LABOUR IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK AND THOSE ARE GOOD ABSOLUTELY GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN WORKFORCE TRAINING- WE NEED RECRUITMENT. AND UP AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DEALING WITH COURSES TRUCKER SHORTAGE- AND YOU KNOW LONG TERM WE ALSO NEED TO ASSIST THESE TRUCKERS. IN CONVERTING THEIR EQUIPMENT FROM THE CURRENT DIESEL COULD MAKE STOCK- TO- ELECTRIC SO- IS NOT RESPECTED THE PORTABLE CAN REALLY WANT TO GIVE THANKS TO THE TO THE LONG STORE. AND THE PMR FOR REALLY HAVING STEPPED UP TO TRAINED. TO TRAIN MORE SKILLED WORKERS AND INCREASE A LABOR FORCE AT AT THE DOCK AND SHOW THAT'S TRUE IN ALLEN LONG BEACH AND ALL REPORTS. THAT OUR LABOR FORCE IS STEPPED UP DURING THE SPEND DOWN MAKE AND WE THANK THEM. THANK YOU FIGURES ANY OTHER STAR LAST COMMENT BY A QUESTION BY MR ON. A GIPSON THANK YOU HAVE ANOTHER PANEL WAITING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INTEREST OF TIME MS PRESIDENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE KNOW YOU ONLY BEEN IN YOUR POSITION FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS- AND YOU YOU HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD OF YOU. I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT IF YOUR GROUP WE TALKED ABOUT COORDINATION- AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR A GREAT FOR LEADERSHIP. I WOULD HOPE THAT- UNDER YOUR LEAERSHIP THAT YOU'RE COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED SUCH SUGGESTIONS AND IF THE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU COULD PLEASE SUBMIT THAT AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE TO THE COMMITTEE. SO THAT WE CAN- HAVE A COPY OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABUT AROUND AROUND HOW TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING. ISSUE IN CRISIS IN THE PORT. ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE OPPOSITE AND WE HAVE TO JUST SOLUTION WILL PROVIDE TO THE- AND I WANT TO THANK THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CAP BUT YOU STILL GOT. BY THE START OF THAT PROCESS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO YES WE ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE THAT YOU. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT LETTER WILL BE COMING OUT TOMORROW IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN KIND OF. BEING THE DRUM ON A YOU ONE PIECE OF PAPER ONE SIDE ONE PIECE OF PAPER WHAT DO YOU NEED. LONG TERM SHORT TERM WITH THAT THANK YOU A PRESENT ONE FOR YOUR FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY. AND FOR YOUR ROLE AND IF WE WANT A PANEL NUMBER ONE. NUMBER ONE. A PANEL OF MARIJUANA SPIKING COSTS AND SCARES CONTAINERS HOW THE BACKUP IS IMPACTING. BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMY. OUR FIRST PANEL WILL DISCUSS HOW THE BACKUP IS IMPACTING BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMY EACH PANELIST WILL HAVE UP TO FIVE MINUTES WILL WRITE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER WE HEAR FROM ALL PANELISTS. ARE COMING FORWARD IS RACHEL MICHELIN ICE HERE RIGHT THERE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION SHE'S IN PERSON. AND THEN WRITER OUGHT ROGER EYES I SOME. WRITER ISON PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION AND BEFORE YOU PROCEED I JUST WANNA KNOW THE PRESENCE OF CENTER DOLLY THERE. WHO REPRESENTS UPPER NORTHERN COSTA MESA PORT OR TWO IT IS DISTRICT. DOWN OKAY I THOUGHT YOU DID AFTER THERE'S A COUPLE OUT THERE K. THERE'S UP THERE SOME UP THERE. SO I WITH THAT I'M O OUR FIRST ARE PRESENT PRESENCE. BY RACHEL MICHELIN. OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN. RIKISHI REGARDLESS. YEAH NOW. TRAVEL YOU CAN. I'M THIRTY GAL ALL RIGHT LET'S START OVER. THEY YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN TODAY IN IMPORTANT FACING US CHAIN GOOD MOVEMENT WE APPLAUD YOUR LEADERSHIP IN FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE ONGOING SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES THAT IMPACT EVERY SEGMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA AND U. S. ECONOMY. NO ONE ENTITY CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THERE'S NOT ONE MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL PUT AN END TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES BUT THIS DOES POSE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS TO AVOID THE SITUATION FROM GETTING WORSE. AND TO PUT IT ALL ON A PATH THAT RESULTS IN A ROBUST WELL RAINY GATES MOVEMENT FOR THE FUTURE. SO WHAT DO RETAILERS SEE AS CHALLENGES TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WHAT OUR SOLUTIONS TO DISCUSS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. NUMBER ONE WE NEED AN HONEST EVALUATION OF HOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS WORKING AND IDENTIFY THE OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT THE MOVEMENT OF CARGO. THROUGH THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM. ONE INVESTMENT IN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED OTHER INVESTMENTS SUCH AS AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS CAN HELP IMPROVE DATA SHARING AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS. NUMBER TWO THE ONGOING SURGE OF IMPORTS HAS LED TO LIMITED WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY WE KNOW THERE IS LITTLE TO NO AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY AND THEN THE NUMBER HIGHER. AND THERE CONTINUES TO BE REGULATORY AND PERMITTING CHALLENGES THAT CREATE BURDENS TO BUILDING AND FACILITIES JUST THIS YEAR REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED THAT WILL IMPACT THE ABILITY TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES AT THE CURRENT ONES. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES AND A MORE EFFICIENT TIME FRAME. NUMBER THREE WE NEED TO ENSURE NEW INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT WILL PROVIDE BETTER INSIGHTS INTO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN. ON AVERAGE OVER TWENTY DIFFERENT ENTITIES TOUCH A CONTAINER WITHIN A PORT. AND NO ONE ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL MOVEMENT OF PRODUCT THIS RESULTS IN A SYSTEM OF STAKEHOLDERS WORKING IN A SILO. COMPLETING THEIR INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF CONTAMINANTS. AND NOT CONSIDERING THE ENTIRE GOODS MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE. NUMBER FOUR. NATIONALLY WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER JOBS HAVE GROWN BY 56% IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND JOB OPENINGS NATIONWIDE. WITH AN AVERAGE ENTRY LEVEL WAGE OF OVER NINETEEN DOLLARS PR HOUR IT IS CRITICAL OUR FUTURE WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WORKFORCE. IS TRAINED TO MEET THE NEEDSOF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SUPPLY CHAIN. SO NOW I WANT TO SHARE WHAT SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ARE DOING TO LEAD ON SOLUTIONS. NUMBER ONE TO ADDRESS THE NEED OF GETTING ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE SAME PAGE PHERAE SPEARHEADING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RESPONSIBLE GOODS MOVEMENT AND WELCOME THE PARTICIPATION OF THESE OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THIS IS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT OF INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE AN INTELLIGENT INDUSTRY LED RESPONSE TOWARDS IMPROVING CALIFORNIA PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT. WHILE WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND GOODS MOVEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE WELCOME THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL GOOD MOVEMENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC LEADERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM LABOR. SPECIFIC TO WHERE HOUSING. C. R. A. IS PARTNERING WITH THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION AND THE RISE UP WAREHOUSE INVENTORY LOGISTICS CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. THIS CERTIFICATE WAS DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT FOUNDATION. WITH A PROJECTED SIX SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS STATE SURPLUS NEXT YEAR THIS PROGRAM IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR CAN COLLABORATE TO BRING THIS PROGRAM TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND LEAD ON A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF TRAINING. OUR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GOODS MOVEMENT WORKFORCE. WE WELCOME THE COLLABORATION OF THIS COMMITTEE I'M MAKING THIS PROGRAM A REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RETAILERS OR ANY UNIQUE UNIQUE POSITION. AT TOUCHING EVERY PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. FROM PORTS TO TRUCKING TO WAREHOUSING AND FINALLY TO THE CONSUMERS RETAIL HAS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS IS IMPACTING THE OODS MOVEMENT IN THE STATE. THIS IS A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OPTIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS. NOW IS THE TIME FOR BOLD LEADERSHIP NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO LOOK AT HOW REGULATIONS LEGISLATION EXECUTIVE ORDERS. AND LOCAL ORDINANCES ARE IMPACTING THE SUPPLY CHAIN. NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO LOOK AT HOW THE USE OR LACK THEREOF OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IS AND IT'S IMPACTING THE SUPPLY CHAIN. NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO HAVE A GOOD STATEMENT THAT IS WORTHY OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA RETAILERS STAND READY TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AND WITH OTHER GOODS MOVEMENT STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND GOODS MOVEMENT. IS THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT IN THE ENTIRE NATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MITCHELL AND WILL HER NOW HER FROM ROGER I SOME OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA CONGENERS. AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION. ROGER YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READING. GOOD MORNING AND- THANK YOU. NOT CHURN AND THIS GERMAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERY SINGLE MEMBER YOU EITHER REPRESENT ONE OF MY GROWERS OR THE PORTS WERE PART GOES OUT SO. I KNOW ITS- OFF TIME OF THE YEAR BUT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOLD ITS HEARING. BUT AS WAS STATED I REPRESENT THE COTTON TREE NOT INDUSTRIES THE INDUSTRIES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON EXPORTS. ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THREE PORTS LONG BEACH LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND. ARE INDUSTRIES THE ONES ARE REPRESENT REPRESENT OVER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN AG EXPORTS. BUT TO PUT IT ON SPECIFIC NUMBERS. ALMONDS ARE THE NUMBER ONE AGRICULTURAL EXPORT AT FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PISTACHIOS NUMBER TWO AT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. ONE THAT'S NUMBER FIVE AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION AND THEN COTTON COMES IN AT NUMBER SEVENTEEN AT JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IMPORT THOMPSON. THAT'S A TOTAL TYPICAL. VOLUME OF OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO USE. MORE SPECIFICALLY- TREE NUTS REPRESENT OVER SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND T. USER. FIFTY NINE. BEECH TREE NOTES ACCOUNT FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO USE ABOUT 3% OF THE AG EXPORT VOLUME. AND COTTON REPRESENTS OVER A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND TWO USER ABOUT 9210% OF THE AG EXPORT VOLUME THROUGH LA ONE BEACH. BUT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THE SITUATION TOOK MY COMMODITIES ARE REPRESENT AND THANKFULLY I REPRESENT COMMODITIES ARE NOT PERISHABLE SO WE HAVE WE CAN SUFFER THIS A LITTLE BIT. 65270% OF THE PROFESSIONALS GOING CALIFORNIA ARE EXPORTED 65% OF THE WALNUTS ARE EXPORTED. 73% OF ALMONDS ARE EXPORTED. AND 1100% OF THE COTTON GOING TO CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTED SO WE'RE DEFINITELY IMPACTED BY THIS. IN TERMS OF DIRECT IMPACTS- WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING A LACK OF EQUIPMENT INCLUDING CONTAINERS AND CHASSIS. UP MORE THAN 80% OF OUR BOOKINGS ARE SCHEDULED- EXPORTS ARE BEING ROLLED IN OTHER WORDS CANCEL TRY TO RESCHEDULE- IN MOST CASES IT'S MULTIPLE TIMES. AS AN EXAMPLE THIS LAST MONTH OF OCTOBER ONE OF MY ONE OF OUR PROCESSORS. HAD ALL TWENTY SEVEN BOOKINGS ROLLED. AND AS OF YESTERDAY. NONE OF THOSE HAVE BEEN RE SCHEDULED TO GO OUT. BECAUSE THE ROLE BOOKINGS ARE CONTAINERS OF THERE AT THE PARK THEY HAVE TO BE STORED WE START PAYING DEMURRAGE AND STORAGE FEES. SOMETIMES AS MUCH OF THE LAST YEAR'S TEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN ADDITIONAL FEES AND SURCHARGES- IN TERMS OF SCHEDULING OUR EARLIEST RECEIVING DATES AND LAST RECEIVING DATES ARE CHANGING ON A DAILY BASIS. SOMETIMES BY THE HOUR. MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR SHIPPERS. IF THEY PULLED UP THE CONTAINER TOO SOON THE SHIP A LITTLE BE CHARGE PER DIEM ON THE OCEAN BY THE OCEAN CARRIER. AT A RATE OF FORTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS PER DAY PER CONTAINER. BOB MOST OCEAN CARRIERS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A GENERATE INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR DOLLARS PER CONTAINER. THERE'S NOW A PEAK SEASON SURCHARGE AND A WEST COAST PORT CONGESTION SURCHARGE. AND THESE CAN RANGE FROM AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CONTAINER. I AS HAS BEEN STATED IS VERY OBVIOUS- MANY SHIPS OR BY PASSING OR OF COUNSEL OPEN ALL TOGETHER. THOSE SHIPS ARE RETURNING EMPTIES TO ASIA INSTEAD OF THE PAST PRACTICE OF HOLDING IRAQ EXPORTS. AS A RESULT WE LOST MARKETS- ESPECIALLY FOR ONE ITS EUROPEAN CHRISTMAS IS A BIG MARKET IS NOW BEING FILLED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS LOST OVER SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE MONTH OF SALES. BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO FILL TIME THE COMMITMENTS. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- WHICH ARE STRUCTURALLY EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS- WE ARE SHIPPING PISTACHIOS ON RAIL CARS TO HOUSTON GALVESTON- THAT'S NOT MAKING MONEY THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE DOLLARS PER CONTAINER BUT IT'S SIMPLE TO KEEP OUR MARKET PLACE. WE'RE ALSO PLACING LIMITS ON REAL COURTS TO BALTIMORE. AT A LOSS JUST TO KEEP OUR EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS. ON THE CON SIDE WE'VE ACTUALLY PHONE. VIA AIR FREIGHT- BALES OF COTTON TO PERU AGAIN JUST TO PRESERVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. AND THEN WE'VE AS BEEN STATE ON SOME OF THE SMALLER PORTS WERE ACTUALLY SHIPPING SOME CONTAINERS THROUGH PORT WHY NINI. AGAIN THIS IS A THAT'S A BANDAID SITUATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY HANDLE LARGE ONE THE CONTAINERS OR LARGE SHIPS. BUT IT IS SOME WAY TO TRY TO SURVIVE THROUGH THIS- IN TERMS OF CAUSES. AGAIN IT'S BEEN STATED MANY TIMES IT'S REALLY IT'S AN IMPERFECT AND OVER ONE SITUATION. ALL RIGHT NOW AND NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THERE'S A HUGE INCREASE IN IMPORTS. COVERT DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF TRUCKERS. BUT FRANKLY THE OPENING HOURS THE PORTS DON'T MATCH THE CURRENT DEMAND- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE ARE AT THE MERCY OF FOREIGN SHIPPING COMPANIES. WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OR TEETH IN TRYING TO GET THESE- FEES CORRECTED OR THEM TO TAKE COME TO- GOING TO TAKE OUR AG EXPORTS- WE'RE GAME THAT- SOMEBODY CHANGE THE RULES ON US AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO CORRECT IT. WE ARE PURELY AT THEIR MERCY. OUR CULTURE AND OUR INABILITY GET OUR EXPORTS OUT HIS SIMPLY COLLATERAL DAMAGE. WE NEED SOLUTIONS WE NEED THEM YESTERDAY. SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ADDITIONAL STORAGE FOR THE CONTAINERS- TRUCKING- TRUCKERS LONGSHOREMAN THERE'S ALL TAKE TIME TO PUT IN PLACE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. SO ANY SOLUTION THAT CAN MOVE THIS ALONG WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS. I GO YOUR- I'LL GO I'M- TO THE RETAILER'S- YOU HAD MENTIONED- ONGOING REGULATORY AND PERMITTING CHALLENGES- THAT YOU DIDN'T MENTION ANY SPECIFICS COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES AND I THINK ONE EXAMPLE I CAN USE IS RECENTLY THIS YEAR THEY PASSED THE INDIRECT SOURCE ROLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON WAREHOUSES AND YOU KNOW WHILE WE WE'RE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE RETAIL INDUSTRY WERE VERY CONSUMER DRIVEN. AND SO WHEN CONSUMERS DEMAND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN THEIR IN THEIR RETAILERS WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO MEET THAT SO WE WANT TO MEET AND WE ARE VERY BROAD AND HIGH IN OUR MENTAL STATE ABILITY GOALS BUT WHEN SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS ARE PASSED. AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THE INDIRECT SOURCE FULL THEY'RE GOOD IN THAT TAXING RETAILERS ARE THE OPERATORS OF THE WAREHOUSES BUT YET THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE SO I WILL SAY WHEN THAT WILL PASSED NOW WITH MAY OF THIS YEAR I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH- RETAILERS SOME NATIONAL RETAILERS WHO WERE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THEIR WAREHOUSE CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW THAT THAT'S OFF THE TABLE AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE UNCERTAINTY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A CONSTANT YOU KNOW LEGISLATION PASSING REGULATIONS PASSING AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE I'VE. TALKED ABOUT WITH SOME OF YOU IS. YOU KNOW ONCE THE- IS THAT LET'S TAKE A STEP LOOK AT ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN PART OF THE LAST TEN YEARS. THAT IMPACT THE SUPPLY CHAIN. LET'S MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING. IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING LET'S TRY TO IMPROVE THAT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LOCAL. APPOINTED BOARDS MAKING REGULATIONS THE LEGISLATURE PASSING BILLS THE GOVERNOR DOING EXECUTIVE ORDERS. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO KEEP THAT. AND WHEN BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY RETAILERS SEE THE UNCERTAINTY. IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WAREHOUSE AND OF THAT ACT. OR ARIZONA AND WE'RE GONNA TRACK THAT ACROSS THE STATE. USE THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER THERE AND BRING IT BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NUMBER ONE WE'RE NOT MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. NUMBER TWO ALL OF THESE JOBS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THIS THIS NOTION THAT THESE WAREHOUSE JOBS ARE NOT THE JOBS THEY ARE THERE THERE ARE SOME OTHER ARE STARTING UPWARDS OF TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR. THOSE JOBS WILL BE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THOSE ARE IT'S NOT JUST ONE I CAN'T POINT TO JUST ONE THING SURE IT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL TOGETHER. AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH FOLKS AND SAY. LET'S HAVE A FRANK CONVERSATION WE'RE NOT SAYING REPEAL EVERYTHING BUT WE'RE SAYING LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. ARE WE HINDERING THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE GOODS MOVEMENT BY THESE REGULATIONS AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO STREAMLINE IT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. I CERTAINLY THINK THAT. THAT WE NEED A HOLISTIC APPROACH I THINK YOU HAVE TO THE CORRECT THAT WE NEED TO. RE EVALUATE AS I SAID EARLIER EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OVER MAYBE WE GO BACK TEN FIFTEEN YEARS- TO SEE KIND OF. HOW A THEY LATER. I THINK WE'VE- A LOT OF THINGS RULES AND MANDATES AND REGULATIONS OVER AN EXECUTIVE ORDERS OVER AND OVER AND OVER ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. AND THAT I THINK HAS MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE THAT NOW IT'S TOO DIFFICULT- IT'S LIKE AN ANCHOR ON SOMEONE THAT SWIMMING. WE SAY UNFORTUNATELY THE SUMMER DOESN'T SWIM FAST ENOUGH ANYMORE BUT INSTEAD OF CUTTING OFF THE ANCHORS AND LIVING THE SUMMER'S CTUALLY- DO WHAT. I HEAR SHE IS SUPPOSED TO DO- IN TERMS OF M. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE AYE YOU MENTIONED THIS CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RESPONSIBLE GOODS MOVING. AT WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO DO AN ANALYSIS. TO OR HELP US DEVELOP- THAT TYPE OF DATA AND INFORMATION OF WHERE WE KNOW WHAT THE WHERE THE LEFT HAND KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING. WITH THAT BEING. SAID THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD HIS THAT. IT EVERYONE'S DOING THEIR OWN THING AND THERE'S NO ONE THAT'S REALLY LIKE BRINGING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND HAVING A CONVERSATION SPECIFIC TO HOW IT'S IMPACTING CALIFORNIA. SO ABSOLUTELY I'VE HAD FOLKS REACH OUT TO ME AND SAY HEY WE CAN PROVIDE WHITE PAPERS ON THIS ISSUE OR WE CAN PROVIDE WHITE PAPERS ON THIS ON THAT ISSUE. I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF YOU WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH ALL THE I THINK IT'S A GREAT. WAY TO SHOW THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMING TOGETHER HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS SO YEAH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DO. THIS HAVE TO BE DATA DRIVEN SURE RIGHT WE CAN'T SAY. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SAY TO YOU IS AS- LEGISLATORS IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO GET RID OF ACTS REGULATION AND LESS I CAN SHOW YOU WHY THAT REGULATION IS NOT WORKING. AND HOW WE CAN TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THOSEGOALS THROUGH ANOTHER AVENUE. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF TIMES AND WE'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND SO WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS COALITION- WELL. I THINK THAT THE OUT. YOUR COLLEAGUES A EXCUSE WE NEED TO. YESTERDAY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE A TO AND FROM- I. TOMORROW IF YOU HAVE IDEAS. IN MY- VIE IF YOU OF IDEAS AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LOOK AT WHAT OCCURRED OVER- THE DECADE OR SO- AND WHAT AT THE SECT WHAT SACRAMENTO IS DONE AND WHAT WHAT WASHINGTON DC HAS DONE TO IMPACT THE SUPPLY CHAIN- AND IF WE CAN BEGIN TO REMOVE THOSE ANCHORS OR REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE- SOLUTIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR ROGER TO GET TO SEE YOU- IN TERMS OF YOU MENTIONED THAT YOUR LAST POINT- THAT YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF- OF THE SHIPPING COMPANY'S- IT WOULD DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS IN TERMS OF. HOW TO CREATE SOME BALANCE AT IN TERMS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. WE DON'T SEE IT- THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS CAN BE RESOLVED IS IF THAT. IF THE CONGESTION EASES. AND THOSE SHIPPING COMPANIES DON'T AREN'T MAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE MAKING OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A CONTAINER FOR THOSE IMPORTS SO. DEALING WITH US AND EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH IS TWICE WHAT WE USED TO PAY FOR- AND EXPORT CONTAINER. WORK WE'RE NOT EVEN ON THE RADAR SCREEN ANYMORE SO. RIGHT NOW AS LONG AS THAT THAT IMPORTANT CRUSHES THERE. THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS IS GOING TO BE. AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO GET A PRODUCT OUT. IN IN TERMS OF. YOUR MEMBERS AND OF COURSE THIS IS THIS IS TRUE- OF AGRICULTURE COMPLETELY IN MY COLLEAGUE I THINK- AS MENTIONED IS BEFORE YOU'RE YOU'RE HAVING TO YOU'RE FORCED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO JUST MAINTAIN MARKET CHER- AND MAINTAIN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD- IN. IN TERMS OF LIKE. OPERATING HOURS YOU MENTIONED THAT- AS WELL- DO YOU FEEL THAT THE- THERE'S NOT AN ALIGNMENT BETWEEN. BETWEEN THE PORTS AND- THE INDISCRETION CENTERS AND- AND THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN RIGHT NOW. WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE OUT YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARD FROM THE DAY THEY CAN SPEAK TO IT BETTER THAN I CAN BUT YES WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S EVEN A COUPLE MORE HOURS- OPEN FOR TRUCKS TO COME INSPECTION ONLY LONG BEACH WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF IT. IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE PROBLEM BUT WOULD HELP WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT PRESSURE AND AGAIN HOPEFULLY THAT'S ENOUGH WHERE I BECAUSE THE SHIPS THEY WAITED TOO LONG AS IT IS- TO THEN WANT TO COME UP TO OPEN AND LOAD AND GO BACK SO. IF WE CAN SHORTEN THAT TIME THAT MAYBE MAKE IT MORE TRACTION TO COME OPEN AND I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION IS CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT PROVIDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGRICULTURE HIS HIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IF NOT THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR OUR REGION- HAVE YOU DONE AN ASSESSMENT OR ANALYSIS OR MAYBE- SURVEYED REMEMBERS WHAT IT HAS BEEN THE FINANCIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT OR THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR- OF AN AGGREGATE. COULD GIVE YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE I DON'T HAVE A TOTAL WE ARE SERVING WE'RE DOING IT ON A ON A MONTHLY BASIS BECAUSE WERE PROVIDING THAT TO THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION. IN PARTICULAR COMMISSIONER DIED TO TRY TO GET SOME. IDEA OF WHAT THAT IMPACT IS I GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONE IS THAT THE LOSS OF SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION ONE MONTH OF SALES. LONG TERM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IMPACT IS- WE'RE TRYING TO REGAIN THAT MARKET SHARE- BUT IF WE DON'T THEN THERE'S HUGE IMPACTS LONGER Y. ONE ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES- YOU KNOW SOMEONE BURKE AGUIAR-CURRY SAID THERE'S NEED. TO BE A SENSE OF URGENCY FOR SURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST A COMMENT- MISTER. IN UP. WE YOU TALK ABOUT ONE SINGLE. ESSENTIALLY INFORMATION SYSTEM WITH REGARD TO THE PORTS AND I ONE OF THE- I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THE PORT DIRECTORS HAVE HAD I THINK THEY WOULD ARGUE. OR SOME OTHERS THE PORTER RENO HAD. IS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO FACE IS NOT EVERY BCO BENEFICIAL CARGO OWNER RETAILERS GOING TO WANT TO SHARE THEIR DATA RIGHT. IF I AM TARGET I DON'T WANT. WALMART KNOWING WHEN I'M SHIPPING ENTER EVEN THE VOLUME OF WHAT I'M SHIPPING AND- HOW DOES THAT COMPORT WITH IT WITH THE GOAL YOU MENTION OF CREATING AN INFORMATION SYSTEM. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IN HONESTLY I THINK THOSE ARE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAVE AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS THAT. IF WE- WANT TO HAVE A SUPPLY CHAIN AND A GOODS MOVEMENT THAT'S WORKING. AND THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND I THINK WITH. WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE AND THERE'S WAYS TO DO THIS BUT YOU CAN MAYBE. GET OUT NOT SURE THAT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BUT AT LEAST GET THE DATA. YOU KNOW AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN GET THE GOODS MOVEMENT. WORKING EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS AND- YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT. I DON'T THINK WE EVER WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE PORTS JUST FULL OF CARGO SHIPS BECAUSE THAT HELPS NO ONE. WHEN ALL OF YOUR CARGO IS SITTING OUT IN THE PORT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET AND THEN. AND I THINK IN A IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. HOME TO THE SILICON VALLEY THERE MUST BE WAYS THAT WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION TO THAT. AND I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FROM THE RETAIL SIDE. TO TRY TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION. GREAT THANK YOU WILL TALK ABOUT EXPORTS. FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE STATE LEGISLATURE. HAS EXPORT A LOT OF ITS AUTHORITY. TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SUCH THAT- WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THEM AND THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR US. AND THAT CREATES A VERY FRUSTRATING DYNAMIC AND HIGH AT TIMES. MANY THINGS HAVE YOU KNOW WITH. A LOT THE CHANGES GOOD. HAVE BECAUSE THE BOARDS ARE. BUT THE SAME AS A LARGE. OFTEN I'VE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I CAN'T IMPACT. A TECHNICAL DECISION THEY'RE MAKING. WITH REGARD TO MATTERS OF MY DISTRICT. THAT MIGHT. NEED TO BE MADE BUT MAYBE MADE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- AND I WAS IT WAS GONNA GO GREEN WE GOTTA MAKE GREAT WILL GO GREAT- AND THEN THAT CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING. SO I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION. THERE MR FONG. WHAT THAT ANY COMMENTS OR ANY. SEGAR CURRY. THANK YOU IN A FIRST OFF THANK YOU ASSESSMENT YOUR SOLUTIONS AND IDEAS THOSE ARE VERY HELPFUL ANOTHER THING WE CAN PUT IN OUR TOOL BOX POTENTIALLY. I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT TWO MISTER ISAM- YOU KNOW YOU. IF EVERYBODY'S EARS DIDN'T PERK UP IS WHEN YOU SAID WE ARE NOT GETTING OUR PRODUCTS EXPORTED. THEY WERE SHIPPING THEM TO TEXAS. MORRELL CARTING TO THE EAST COAST. OR FLYING COTTON TO PERU. ALL OF THIS IS COSTING SOMEBODY A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S ALL OF US THAT ARE SITTING IN THIS ROOM IN THE LONG RUN. IT'S HURTING THE PRODUCERS- OUR AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES SO ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AGRICULTURE CALIFORNIA WE TELL OURSELF IS BEING THE NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR THE BEST QUALITY PRODUCT IN THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BUY OUR PRODUCTS. WE DON'T OUR PRODUCTS IT'S ON ON AT A WAREHOUSE RID SITTING ON THE PORCH AND IT'S NOT FRESH AND WONDERFUL ALL THE THINGS WE COUNTED. IT'S A COST TO THE CONSUMER IS COST TO OUR OUR INDUSTRY SO- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT IS THAT- WHEN IT'S SITTING IN THE CHASIDIC COST TO MOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM POINT. WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF OURSELVES THAT WE ARE NOT EXPORTING IT FROM CALIFORNIA IN A TIMELY FASHION AND SO- I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT TO HER AND WAS ATTENTION IS LIKE WE WORRY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WELL BY THE TIME YOU CURRENT THE STUFF ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IS THAT MAKES SENSE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION AND- HOPEFULLY. WE CAN WORK ON A SOLUTION FOR THAT. THANK YOU GENERALLY GONZALEZ S. THANK YOU ALL GREAT COMMENTS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY AS WELL I JUST WANTED TO ASK- EITHER OF YOU BUT I KNOW- MYSTERY SOME UNIT- MENTION THE CONTAINER FEES IS SORT OF RANGE- I DON'T KNOW AND ON THE BEEN THE PORTS PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN INFERRING IN A LOT OF MEDIA THAT IT SEEMS TO BE MOVING IN A GOOD DIRECTION WITH CONTAINER FEES OF COURSE IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST KIND OF RUNS THE GAMUT BUT- WHAT CAN YOU SAY DO YOU EXPECT THESE CONTAINER FEES TO. BE JUST IN THIS EMERGENCY ONLY DO EXPECT THEM TO BE LONG TERM WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR YOU AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE JUST SO WE CAN GET ENOUGH ADDITIONAL INSIGHT WELL WE HOPE IT'S IN THE SHORT TERM YEAH AND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS- BUT LIKE ANYTHING YET IT'LL START TO THROTTLE GO UP IT'LL COME DOWN BUT IT DOESN'T EVER COME BACK TO WHAT IT WHAT IT WAS BEFORE- BUT YES WE HOPE SO MANY SURCHARGES LIKE THIS WEST COAST PORT CONGESTION SURCHARGE WILL GO AWAY. AND SOME OF THOSE AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE'RE THIS IS OUR BUSINESS RIGHT I MEAN LIKE I SAID ALL THESE COMMODITIES MORE THAN 70% OR PRODUCTS EXPORTED WE KNOW HOW TO SCHEDULE AND THE SYSTEM WORKS WHEN IT WHEN IT'S NOT IN THE SITUATION SO WE'RE NOT PAYING. ATTENTION TO MERGE FEES MOST OF THE TIME- EVEN WHEN WE DO WHEN THERE'S THAT ODD CASE MOST THE TIME THE KERRS WILL WAIVE THAT RIGHT NOW THAT THEY'RE NOT AND SO- WE WOULD HOPE IT WOULD GO AWAY AND CERTAINLY- DIMINISH- ONCE WE GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY AS WELL WITH THE INDIRECT SOURCE REAL I KNOW THAT THAT IS A THREE YEAR PHASE IN PERIOD SO DEPENDING ON THE WAREHOUSE- SQUARE FOOT SIZE. TIME- SO I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE THESE REGULATIONS ARE ALWAYS TOUGH BUT- TO BEAR BUT I KNOW A LOT OF THE POOR COMMUNITIES ALSO ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF EMISSION SOURCES SO- YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THAT OUTCOME THAT TASK FORCE HASN'T. LOOKED FOR TO BEING PART OF THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. SAID ALI. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET INTO THIS BUT YOU MATCH IN YOUR STATEMENT OF FOREIGN SHIPS WHAT WHAT'S THE RATIO FOR TO. CHIPSET- OUR AMERICAN TOP. THERE NO LONGER ANY AMERICAN SHIPPING LINES THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WOULD THAT WILK THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND YOUR WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THAT MOVIE WILL MOVE TO A PANEL TO. WHICH OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN EASING CONGESTION OUR SECOND PANEL WILL DISCUSS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ROLE IN EASING CONGESTION AS A REMINDER WE WILL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE END OF THIS PANEL UNFORTUNATELY. CONGRESSMAN ALAN LOWENTHAL. IT IS STARTING TO TALK RIGHT NOW. BOB BUT HE'S UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PERSON BUT HE SENT A RECORDED MESSAGE- HE'S A GOOD GUY HE REPRESENTS THE PORT OF LONG BEACH- HE'S BEEN IN FULLY ENGAGED IN PORTS MATTER SINCE ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT I WAS A GOOD GUY SO WE'LL GO TO A CONGRESSMAN BONTA. HI RES AND. ALSO HELLO WORLD LARGEST. AND WE'RE SEEING OTHERS. STEP. THE BILL BACKED. THIS IS. FOR USING WHICH WAS CAPACITY AND CRITICALLY INJURED. GOOD SCHOOL. PEOPLE SPIEGEL WHO DISAGREE HAVE BEEN PATIENT BY. NO THIS WE ARE STRUGGLING SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. CONGRESS AND IF IT IS STEPPING UP AND DOING EVERYTHING. TO THANK YOU WITH YOU THIS MEANS THAT STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOU CONGRESSMAN NOW. FOR SURE US YOUR THOUGHTS TODAY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AT THE FED LEVEL ALL THERE'S A LETTER IN YOUR PACKET FROM- JOHN COREY HE'S THE PORT. FOR THE BYTON HARRISON. AND OUTLINES FEDERAL. TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS NOW MOVE TO OUR PAN THERE ALREADY OUT HERE GREAT- TODAY WE BEFORE- DAVID CAMPS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE. AGENCY HERE THOSE ANDY MY SENIOR. GOV GAVIN AND DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALSO IN PERSON WITH US TODAY MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY. THE MORNING CARE. THE WHOLE SET ON. WE'LL START OVER YEAH WE GOT GOOD MORNING CHERYL DONALD CHURCHES ALSO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR CALLING THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY HEARING IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE DEALING MYERS DIRECTOR OF GOLD IS. JUST TO PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS AT THE OUTSET. FIRST WE ARE EXPERIENCING GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES THIS IS NOT. JUST A CALIFORNIA SITUATION AS CENTER BRADFORD POINTED OUT. NO NO THAT'S GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD- BUT IT IS WORTH UNDERSCORING. WHAT THE SUMMER AND FALL KEY PORTS ABROAD HAVE SHUT DOWN FOR WEEKS DUE TO CODED AS WELL AS OVERSEAS FACTORIES PRODUCING GOODS FOR THE US. MAJOR PORTS IN HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPERIENCING SIMILAR CONGESTION TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS. SECOND WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN EVERY LINK IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDING RETAILERS BENEFICIAL CARGO OWNERS WITH LOGISTICS WORKFORCE RETENTION AND ELSEWHERE. ALL OF YOU HAVE SEEN RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH CALLING ON TERMINAL OPERATORS TO PROVIDE EXPANDED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN GATE OUT GATE HOURS. AND THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR. IT'S ALSO IMPERATIVE. THAT WE CONTINUE TO COORDINATE WITH RETAILERS. AND BENEFICIAL CARGO OWNERS TO OFFICIALLY MOVE YOUR CONTAINERS FROM OUR PORTS. WE ALSO NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS. TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR CONTAINER YARDS SO WE HAVE CONTAINER CHALICES AND TRUCKING CAPACITY SERVICES NOW TO REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY LONG BEACH MAYOR ROBERT GARCIA. TO TEMPORARILY WAIVE THE PROHIBITION ON CONTAINER STOCK MORE THAN TWO HIGH. THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOLISTIC COORDINATION ON SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE DIRECTOR MYERS FOR INVITING THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY CAL STUCK TO PARTNER ON THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN TO STEP SIX USSISHKIN. WITH THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND CAL STATE LONG BEACH IS CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE. AND TRANSPORTATION. AS PART OF THAT INITIATIVE WE HOSTED A VERY SUCCESSFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS IN SEPTEMBER. AND WE'RE NOW WAITING ON THE FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE MEANTIME I WANT TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU ACTIONS WE HAVE CAL STAR ARE ALREADY TAKING TO ADDRESS SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES. FIRST THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC KILLS TO HAS BEEN LASER FOCUSED ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN THE MOVEMENT OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES. PP FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE FIRST FEW MUCH THE PANDEMIC THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION TEMPORARY TEMPORARILY ALLOWED STATES TO RESTRICT WHAT LIMITS ON THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM. FOR THE DELIVERY OF EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES. CALTRANS TOOK IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TEMPORARY FLEXIBILITY. AND FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS CALTRANS HAS BEEN PERMITTING OVERSIZE AGRICULTURAL TRUCK OPERATIONS ON THE NON INTERSTATE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO MITIGATE WORKER RETENTION ISSUES IN THE AG TRUCKING INDUSTRY. AND NOW PURSUANT TO EXECUTIVE ORDER IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. CALTRANS WILL IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE PRIORITY THREE ROUTES TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A TEMPORARY EXEMPTION OF TRUCK WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE NON INTERSTATE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. ALSO ENQUIRING WITH US DOT WHETHER ANY ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR OVERSIZED TRUCK OPERATIONS ON THE INTERSTATE CAN BE APPLIED. NOW AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT TIME IN WASHINGTON AS A SENIOR LEVEL- APPOINTEE AT THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION I'VE ALSO TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE CORDONING WITH U. S. DOT LEADERSHIP. AND THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES. IN JULY ARE REPRESENTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CIRCUITRY PEOPLE JUDGES ROUNDTABLE WITH ST PETER OF A SUPPLY CHAIN STAKEHOLDERS. AND AS A FOLLOW UP TO SECRETARY PERDUE JUDGES ROUNDTABLE I COORDINATED THE PARTICIPATION OF WHITE HOUSE PORT ENVOY JOHN PER CARI. AND ACTING MARITIME ADMINISTRATOR LUCINDA LESLIE IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS INITIATIVE. I AM IN REGULAR CONVERSATION WITH ENVOY FOR CARI TOMORROW VERY WELL FROM MY TIME AT U. S. D. O. T. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH HIM. AND SUPPORTING HIS EFFORTS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS TO SECURE ACCESS TO LAND FOR CONTAINER YARD. ALSO MAINTAINING COMMUNICATION WITH FEDERAL FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION SURE DOWN BUFFET. AND COMMISSIONER KARL BENTZEL. BOTH OF WHOM HAVE RECENTLY TRAVELED TO CALIFORNIA TO MEET FORTY STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS KELSO HAS PARTICIPATED MEETINGS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE GOBIZ LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO DISCUSS TRUCK DRIVER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. SEVERAL OF OUR AGENCIES ARE ALSO DEVELOPING A STUDY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA TO EXAMINE AG TRUCKING WORKFORCE ISSUES. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WORKFORCE ISSUES LOOM LARGE- IN FACT JUST LAST WEEK WE MET WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND MEERA JOSHI. THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOMINEE TO HEAD UP THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. WITH A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT APPLYING REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL TRUCKING WORKFORCE. NOW AS FAR AS LONG TERM SOLUTIONS ARE CONCERNED LESS THAN A WEEK AGO GOVERNOR NEWSOM ANNOUNCED A HISTORIC STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH US DOT. TO JOINTLY DEVELOP. WITH REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS A PROGRAM OF MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FREIGHT RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THIS PARTNERSHIP WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO EXPEDITE A NETWORK OF RELATED PROJECTS RATHER THAN USING A PIECEMEAL APPROACH. THAT COLLECTIVELY WILL HELP GROW THE ECONOMY. IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND STRUCK IN SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE THROUGHOUT THE US AND CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL THREE QUARTERS. SO USDOT AND CAL STAR WILL EXECUTE WHAT'S CALLED AN EMERGING PROJECTS AGREEMENT. WERE DOT WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. EXPERTISE AND STAFF TIME TO DEVELOP PROJECTS FOR ENTRY INTO INNOVATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS LIKE TO FREE UP. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION ACT AS WELL AS ROOF WHICH STANDS FOR RAILROAD ROUTE REAL RAILROAD REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT FINANCING PROGRAM. AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND TO FEEL AND ROOF ARE AMONG THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRIMEROS LOAN PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY OFFER VERY FAVORABLE LOAN REPAYMENT TERMS FOR PROJECT SPONSORS. ANYONE WHO CAN GET A TWO IF YOU ARE REFLECTS ON HIS MOST FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT USUALLY PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN A PROJECTS OVERALL FUNDING AND FINANCING PLAN IT WORKS ESPECIALLY WELL. FOR MEGA PROJECTS. WHAT'S TRULY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENT IS THAT IT WILL GIVE CALIFORNIA ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO TAKE A PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO ADVANCE FREE PROJECTS AND LEVERAGE LOCAL. AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AS WELL AS TARGETING STATE INVESTMENT THROUGH GRANTS THE BUDGET PROCESS OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STRUCTURE BACK. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IN THE PAST IT WAS A SERIES OF ONE OFF PROJECTS WITH VERY LITTLE CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO HELP PROJECTS FIT TOGETHER IN A HOLISTIC MANNER. IN ADVANCE COMMON GOALS. ALL OF THAT WILL CHANGE THE DISAGREEMENT. ON TOP OF THAT THE AGREEMENT WILL SUDDEN SET THE STAGE FOR LEVERAGING FEDERAL SUPPORT IN CARRYING OUT THE DIRECTION OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AND NINETEEN TWENTY ONE TO DEVELOP PROPOSALS AND PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR PORT AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. SO BY DREDGING UP HOLISTIC PROGRAM A PROJECT AIMED AT ELIMINATING BOTTLENECKS AND IMPROVING THE FLOW OF GOODS IN AND AROUND CALIFORNIA PORTS. THESE PROJECTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE HARMFUL POLLUTION WITH FEWER ODDLY TRUCKS AND SHIPS AT SEA. SORE VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THE AGREEMENT WILL MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA I THINK IT REPRESENTS A STRONG FEDERAL STATE COLLABORATION AND FRANKLY. IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF APPROACH WE NEED IN ORDER TO TACKLE THIS VERY COMPLEX CHALLENGE AS I'VE SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS. EVEN A LARGE STAKE WHITE CALIFORNIA CANNOT SOLVE THIS ON OUR OWN WE THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS TO IDENTIFY AND PURSUE THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENTS AND I LOOK FOR TO KEEP YOU UPDATED AS WE MOVE AHEAD. FINALLY I SIMPLY WANT TO NOTE THAT WE GET CALLS TO HAVE LED THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN COORDINATING ADVOCACY WITH CONGRESS AND THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN JOBS ACT AND THE BILL BACK BETTER BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL THAT'S NOW PENDING IN CONGRESS AS CONGRESSMAN LOWENTHAL ALLUDED TO. THIS SUMMER I LEAD A MULTI STATE COALITION URGING CONGRESS TO PASS THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL. TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN BILLION. IN COASTAL PORTS. INLAND WATERWAYS LAND PORTS OF ENTRY. AND FERRIES WHICH ARE ALL ESSENTIAL TORN NATION THREE. AND JUST LAST MONTH I WROTE TO THE ENTIRE CONGRESSIONAL TO CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL DELEGATION TO URGE CONGRESS TO PROVIDE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS TO SUPPORT SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL NOW PENDING INCLUDES SEVENTEEN BILLION FOR PORTS AND WATERWAYS AND THE RECONCILIATION BILL THE HOUSE AT SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE MARITIME ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE AND INCREASE PORT VISIT OUR OFFICIAL C. SO THROW ADVOCACY WITH CONGRESS IN A RECENT AGREEMENT WITH US DOT. KELSO HAS REALLY ELEVATED THE DISCUSSION AROUND CALIFORNIA'S NEED FOR FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. I THINK WE ARE NOW VERY WELL POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDING. AT A TIME WHEN CONGRESS WILL BE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. ONE LAST NOTE AND I AM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF CHIRLA DONALD ENSURE GONZALEZ ONE TAKE A MOMENT TO COMMEND AND THANK ALL THE WOMEN AND MEN- WORKING TO KEEP GOODS MOVING IN AND OUT OF OUR PORTS. THESE WORKERS HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO KEEP THE SUPPLY CHAIN MOVING IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I HOPE ALL OF US CAN BE EXPLOITED INSPIRED BY THEIR EXAMPLE. AS WE COLLECT WE STEP UP TO TACKLE THE MANY IMPORTANT CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF US. AND SO WITH THAT SURE O'DONNELL INSURE GONZALEZ THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU TO DIRECTOR MYERS. THANK YOU SHERMAN O'DONNELL AND CAROLINE'S ALL US- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR INVITING ME HERE DISCUSS- WHAT IS CLEARLY A PRESSING ISSUE ISSUE OF CONGESTION NOT ONLY IN OUR- CALIFORNIA PORTS AROUND. THANKS MY NAME IS DEE DEE MYERS AND I'M A SENIOR ADVISER TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WE ALL KNOW WITH GOBIZ- I KNOW A LOT IT'S BEEN SAID AND WRITTEN INCLUDING HERE TODAY ABOUT THE CAUSES OF SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SECRETARY KIM NOTED- IT'S A GLOBAL PROBLEM MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED OVER NIGHT GOOD TO MOVE AROUND THE WORLD VIA AN EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX SYSTEM RIGHT TO SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS- IT'S CONTROLLED MOSTLY BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PRIVATE CONTRACTS IS ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED- CHANGING COST STRUCTURES NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND EVOLVING TERRACE AMONG OTHER THINGS WERE ALREADY PUTTING PRESSURE ON THAT SYSTEM AND WHEN CODE NINETEEN HIT MORE CRACKS WERE REVEALED AND THE PROBLEMS WERE EXACERBATED- EARLY ON A LOT OF NATION'S LIMITED OR SHUT DOWN GOOD TO MOVEMENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH CREATING A BACKLOG THAT TROUBLED AROUND THE WORLD- AND A SHIPPING RESUMED CONSUMER BEHAVIOR CHANGED- AND DEMAND SURGE THAT BACKLOG GREW INTO THE SEVERE CONGESTION THAT WE'RE NOW EXPERIENCING- AND THIS LED TO REAL AND SOMETIMES PERCEIVED SHORTAGES EVERYTHING FROM TOILET PAPER STATIONARY BIKES TO IN THE EARLY DAYS SUPPLIES NEEDED TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC. SO IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WE'D GO BIZ WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES APART ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES FACING BOTH THE HEALTH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN OUR CENTRAL WORKERS- AND TO GET THEM THE CRITICAL SUPPLIES THAT THEY NEEDED SO WE TAPPED EXISTING STATE RESERVES OF GLOVES MASKS AND OTHER PP AND FOUND SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE MILLIONS MORE WE WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THIS AS MANUFACTURERS RETOOLED FROM MAKING CLOSE TO MAKING A NINETY FIVE MASKS OR FOR MAKING- LIQUOR PRODUCTS TO MAKE HAND SANITIZER AND THEN WE PUT PRIORITIZE GETTING THAT P. P. E. R. TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS INCLUDING PORT WORKERS. ARE WHEN VACCINES BECAME AVAILABLE WE AGAIN PRIORITIZED OUR PORTS UNDERSTANDING THAT PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THOSE WORKERS. ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN WAS ACTUALLY AB. SEND TO KEEP GOOD TO MOVE. HELP WHAT IS THE PROBLEM OUTED. WE ALSO LOOK FOR OTHER STEPS THAT WE COULD TAKE BECAUSE WE KNEW IT WAS CRITICAL. TO BRING TOGETHER THE DIVERSE NETWORK OF SUPPLY CHAIN STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS KEY CHALLENGES AND FIND. CREATIVE SOLUTIONS SO THAT'S IN SEPTEMBER SECRETARY KIM NOTED WE PARTNERED WITH CAL STUFF. THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH OUGHT TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS INITIATIVE. AND KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT INCLUDED A MEDIA A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO. ELEVATE SOME OF THE ISSUES A VIRTUAL WORKSHOP AND THEN IN PERSON SENATE. I'M IN THE FORM FINAL REPORT OF THAT WILL BE. AVAILABLE SOMETIME IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO BUT THE CONVENING MADE A COUPLE OF THINGS CLEAR. ODDS THAT THERE WAS A QUITE A BIT OF AGREEMENT AMONG STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT THE SHORT TERM STEPS AND LONGER TERM STEPS. WOULD BE NEEDED TO GET THINGS MOVING AGAIN WE NEED TO CREATE MORE STORAGE SPACE FOR CONTAINERS WILL PREPARE A LOT ABOUT. INCREASE ACCESS TO CHASTITY'S. TRANSITION THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO MORE HOURS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO BECOME THE SHORTHAND FOR THAT. COLLECT AND USE DATA MORE EFFICIENTLY GROW AND PREPARE THE SUPPLY CHAIN WORKFORCE FOR NOW IN THE FUTURE. AND INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NEED TO CREATE CAPACITY AND RESILIENCE AS WE GO FORWARD- BUT PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT OF THAT CONVENING. WAS THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS AGREEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD THAT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE STAKEHOLDER IN SUPPLY CHAIN IS GOING TO HAVE TO STEP U AND MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES. AND BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT. OF THAT FROM EVERYBODY TODAY- INCLUDING THE STATE. OUGHT SO TO THAT END- WE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT XCELERATED OUR WORK- WHICH LED TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH WAS ISSUED ON SEPTEMBER. TWENTIETH THE EO- DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO IDENTIFY STATE ON PROPERTIES AS YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS SHORT TERM- CARGO CONTAINER STORAGE NEEDS IN GOLD IS ALSO WORKING WITH. FEDERAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS TO- IDENTIFY POSSIBLE OPTION- CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IS DIRECTED- TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTES TO BE CONSIDERED FOR TEMPORARY EXEMPTION WOULD SECRETARY MANAGE- AND- GROUP GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITS AND ALLOW. TRUCKS TO CARRY ADDITIONAL CARGO. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AGENCIES DIRECTED TO CREATE WORKFORCE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS EXPEDITE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIX THIRTY NINE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS DIRECTED TO WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES DEVELOP TO DEVELOP. LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT SUPPORT PORT OPERATIONS AND GOOD MOVEMENTS. FOR THE GOVERNOR JANUARY. TENTH BUDGET- IS SO THAT'S RELATIVELY SHORT TERM- IDENTIFICATION IN THOSE WILL INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ELECTRIC PERFECT ELECTRIFICATION OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT. SYSTEM FROM PORT TO DELIVERY. DATA DIGITIZATION WILL PREPARE A LOT ABOUT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. SO IN ADDITION TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING OTHER STEPS. AGAIN THE SECRETARY SAID COUNTS TO TEMPORARILY RELAX WAIT REGULATIONS FOR TRUCKS. BOTH HAULING ROOM. EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES EARLY ON IN THE AG PRODUCTS. WE'VE CREATED AN INTERAGENCY SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE YOU KNOW THE BROADER STAKEHOLDERS BUT INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- NOT ONLY IMPLEMENTING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. BUT ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL OTHER SOLUTIONS AND THEN LAST WEEK THE GOVERNOR CAST ON THE U. S. DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION SIGNED EPA THAT. THE SECRETARY DISCUSSED. OUT WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND OUR LABOR PARTNERS AS WE GO FORWARD. I'M SHOWING THE PRESIDENT- PRESENT BIDEN WAS HERE IN OCTOBER OCTOBER FOURTEENTH- AND ANNOUNCED THE- LA LA WOULD JOIN LONG BEACH AN OPENING THIS CASE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WHICH- YOU KNOW BIG. BIG BEGAN TO CREATE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS JOINING THAT CONVERSATION FROM SOME OF OUR LARGE RETAILERS LIKE WALMART TARGET SAM SUNG AND HOLD HOME DEPOT. FEDEX AND UPS ALSO AGREED TO MOVE MORE CONTAINERS DURING NIGHT TIME HOURS. WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT HOW THE RAIL RAIL. CARRIERS ARE CRITICAL TO THIS. THEY'VE UNION PACIFIC IS COMMITTED TO A SIXTY DAHLE REBATE FOR CAN. THAT ENTER THE PORTS ON WE AND BE. IS OFFERING A FIFTY DOLLAR INCENTIVES AND OF COURSE THE I. O. W. S. PLEDGE TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SCHEDULE SO THERE'S A LOT OF. INTEREST IN EXPANDING HOURS- BUT IT'S IT YOU KNOW ONE STEP AT A TIME- THE PORT OF LONG BEACH ALSO UNVEILED ITS PILOT PROJECT WITH TTI TO EXPAND GATES. OCTOBER TERMINAL HOURS AT ONE TERMINAL SO- AND FINALLY WE HEARD- THE L. A. PORTS THE- REPORT ADDED UP A NEW FEE- WHICH WILL TAKE AFFECTED MIDDLE OF THIS MONTH. SO IT'S CLEAR THERE'S NO SINGLE CAUSE AND THERE IS CERTAINLY NO SINGLE SOURCE SIMPLE SOLUTION- WE CAN ONLY SOLVE THIS CRISIS IF EVERYONE WORKS TOGETHER. STARTING WITH TRANSITIONING- TO MORE ROBUST ROUND THE CLOCK SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATION IDENTIFYING THOSE ADDITIONAL SITES- CLEARING EMPTY CONTAINERS OFF THE PORT TO ALLOW FOR MORE EFFICIENT- AND MORE ACCESSIBLE MOVEMENT OF GOODS- SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US- AND- AND- WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AS WE GO FORWARD. I'M ENCOURAGED BY HOW EVERYBODY HAS STEPPED UP THE PORCH THE RETAILER'S THE RAILWAYS THE WAREHOUSES- YOU KNOW TO REALLY TRY TO SOLVE THESE COMPLEX AND VERY INTERCONNECTED CHALLENGES- AND WE ARE OF COURSE AS HAS BEEN SAID FOREVER INDEBTED TO THE LONGSHOREMEN STEVEDORES THE CHECKERS THE WAREHOUSE PERSONNEL THE CRANE OPERATORS THE TRUCKERS. THE REAL OPERATING SHIPBUILDERS AND FERRYBOAT OPERATORS IN PORT AUTHORITY PERSONNEL WHO HAVE. STEPPED UP TO OUT OF THIS CRISIS SOMETIMES PUTTING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK TO DO SO I THINK WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT BY WORKING COLLABORATIVELY- WE CAN MEET. OUR MUTUAL GOALS WE HAVE THE ACCELERATOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN PROTECT THE ASSET OF OUR PORTS WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT TRANSITION TO CLEANER MORE RESILIENT SLOT SUPPLY CHAIN FROM BEGINNING TO END. AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE CREATION. OF HIGH QUALITY JOB PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THOSE JOBS- THAT WILL ENSURE THAT OUR PORTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE ENGINES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH I'VE BEEN SO ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND HAVE MADE US A LEADER. IN THE WORLD IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON. ON THE PLANET SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ROADS FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I JUST QUICK QUESTION FOR- DIRECTOR OF MYERS- THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS- THAT AS SOME OF THE EXECUTIVE AGENCIES WHAT LOOK FOR MORE SPACE MORE LAND. YEP OUR PROPERTY JUST STORE CONTAINERS BECAUSE THE DOCKS ARE FULL. WHAT WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THAT EFFORT. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- REQUIRES THAT THAT THAT THAT SURVEYED COMPLETE BY JUST FIFTEENTH WE MAY BE DONE SOONER SO. WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE STARTED BY WORKING WITH THE PORTS TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS OF THAT LAND WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD WORK. AND THEN TO START TO SERVE A DIFFERENT PARCELS AND I THINK WE TRIED TO EXPAND THAT SEARCH WE NOW HAVE A- A PRETTY LOW BUT ROBUST LIST OF SEVERAL DOZEN. THERE ARE COMMON COMPLICATIONS FOR EACH OF THEM BUT WE'RE KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THE QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- WHICH IF ANY- WOULD BE- WOULD ACTUALLY HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO JIM PROCESS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO. KEEP YOU POSTED IF AS AS WE GO FORWARD BUT AGAIN THE ETHOS OF A STATUS AS A DEADLINE OF NO LATER THAN DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. AT APPRECIATE THE ECONOMY YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AN EXPEDITED GET IT DONE BEFORE DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. AND THOSE PROPERTIES WOULD SERVE BOTH PORTS. YEAH ADDITION WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING. THE WITHIN NOT WITHIN A RANGE OF BOTH PARTS BUT I THINK DEPENDING ON ON WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT WHAT PROP YOU KNOW WHAT. ASSETS THEY OFFER. OTHER COULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO EITHER PORK OR BOTH PARTS. GREAT THANK YOU. AND QUESTION FOR SECRETARY KIM. THIS SOMEONE IN INDIANA IS GETTING A CHEAP TV. BUT CALIFORNIA IS PAYING THE PRICE IN IN IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTALLY. BUT ALSO FINANCIALLY WERE CARRYING SOME OF THE BURDEN TO SUPPORT OUR PORTS BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT GETTING. OUR FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL DOLLARS SO WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING. TO ENSURE THAT THAT GOING FORWARD. WE DO WORK TO GET OUR FAIR SHARE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO SUPPORT. OUR PORTS WHICH MOVE. MOST OF. THE NATION'S GOODS AND WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW. BE THE OVERWHELMING RECIPIENT OF THOSE DOLLARS ALREADY TO CLEARLY WERE NOT. JERRELL DONNELL THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE THAT THERE IS AN INVESTMENT IN BALANCE BETWEEN. CO OF PORTS ALONG THE EAST COAST AND GULF COAST RELATIVE TO CLOSE UP POST SORRY PORTS ON THE WEST COAST HUGE AMOUNTS HAS BEEN HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY VARIOUS FOLKS. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND CALL AND THE ENTIRE CONGRESS. AND THE WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THAT AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THANKFULLY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT'S NOW PENDING INCLUDE SEVENTEEN BILLION FOR PORTS. AND THEN IN THE RECONCILIATION BILL SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESILIENCY PROJECTS SO THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY COMING DOWN THE PIKE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET AS MUCH OF AS WE CAN MOST OF THIS WILL BE DONE EITHER A COMBINATION OF FORMULA. AND DISCRETIONARY- REGARDLESS IF IT'S DISCRETIONARY WE'RE GOING TO COMPETE LIKE CRAZY FOR THAT MONEY AND NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THE WEEDS BUT THE REASON THERE'S NO BALANCE IN THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUNDS BECAUSE JUST THE UNUSUAL NATURE. OF THE FORMAL OF THE WAY IT'S SET UP. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT AND WITH THE HELP OF PEOPLE LIKE CONGRESSMAN LOWENTHAL AND OTHERS- WE'RE GONNA DO IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER. QUESTIONS REALLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR FONG- I THINK YOU MUCH- I'VE I GUESS FIRST GOING TO. A DIRECTOR MYERS- I APPRECIATE THE UPDATE I YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THERE'S AS TASK FORCE THAT'S IN PLACE AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE RETAILER'S YOU'VE HEARD FROM- INFORMATICA SERVER FROM A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS I'M SURE YOU'RE TALKING TO ALL OF THE DAILY- AND OF COURSE THIS CONCERNED ABOUT RE EVALUATING. THE SYSTEM IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES AND OF COURSE. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH IS THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING AT. ALL THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND WHAT'S BURDENING THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND- WILLING TO REMOVE SOME OF THOSE- ANCHORS. YES I THINK WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT- AT AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH IT AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND TO FIND WAYS TO TRY TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD I THINK. THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS OF GREAT COMPLICATED SET OF PROBLEMS- AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE WILLING TO JUST WHOLESALE. INDEFINITELY LIFT CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECT WORKERS PROTECTS THE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE. QUARTERS OF COMMERCE THAT WE AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR EVEN BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BUT I THINK WE'VE ALREADY SHOWN. THAT WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT- LIFTING REGULATIONS YOU KNOW WHAT WEIGHT LIMITS ON TRUCKS OFFER CRITICAL SUPPLIES FINDING NEW ROUTES TWENTY OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE IS- IN IN IN IN YOUR- GROUP BUT DAVID IS- HELP TO EXPEDITE. LICENSES FOR PROPER THROUGH DMV ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WHERE WE CAN YOU KNOW ACCOMMODATE CHANGES- TO FACILITATE THE PROBLEM BUT NOT TO MAKE WHOLESALE THROWING OUT. OF SOME OF THE IMPORT PROTECTION AND I'M AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THROWING THINGS OUT I THINK OVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT HAND RIGHT NOW NOT COMMUNICATING. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT WE WILL TAKE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OUR THEIR ACCOMMODATIONS WE CAN MAKE TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE PROGRESS ENSURING SLOWER AND SAID THERE IS A CONCERN AND IN APPRECIATION WITH AN ADMINISTRATION THAT. YOU HAVE TO LOOK NOT ONLY. RETROSPECTIVELY BUT PROSPECTIVELY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS- WITH THAT AFFECT THE SUPPLY CHAIN WHETHER IT'S OFFENSE- THE REPAIR REGULATIONS OR OR ORDINANCES THAT IMPACT. THE PORTS RAIL TRUCKING MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSES- THAT ARE NOT HAVING GONE INTO EFFECT YET. THAT TO COULD GO INTO EFFECT IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO THAT ACTUALLY COULD. EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE IS AN APPRECIATION AMONGST MINISTRATION ABOUT THAT. YEAH I THINK AGAIN I THINK WE WANT HAVE A CONTINUED CALM DIALOGUE WITH ALL OF YOU AND WITH OUR PARTNERS THE INDIAN AT. EVERY NODE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WE DO TALK REGULARLY TO AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE IN. IN THIS. CHAIN THAT'S MORE. FOR ALSO MEET OUR- LONG TERM ECONOMIC GOALS WHICH IS INCLUDING TRANSITIONING TO A- TO A CLEANER COST SUPPLY CHAIN BUT YES I THINK THE- SHORT ANSWER IS YES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD AS WE MAKE INVESTMENTS AND AS WE TRY TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO BUILD AGAIN A RESILIENT- SUPPLY CHAIN. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO WHAT IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO LET ALONE TEN YEARS AGO WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND HOW TO MEASURE. CALIFORNIA TO STICK TO SUCCEED AND THRIVE. IN THAT ENVIRONMENT HOW DO WE WORK WITH ALL THE PARTNERS REQUIRED TO DO THAT- STRESSING THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZED UNDERSTAND ALL THE CHALLENGES WHICH AGAIN IS. IS MIND BOGGLINGLY COMPLICATED SURE WHAT LET ME JUST ASK DIRECTLY THEN I MEAN IS THE ADMINISTRATION WILLING TO LOOK AT. THE WAREHOUSE ORDINANCES- THE IMPACTS FROM FEES BOARDS THAT THE CHAIR IS MENTIONED. ARE THEY WILLING TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW THINGS ON TRUCKING THAT GABY FIVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING OR THE IT'S A DEMONSTRATION WILLING TO LOOK AT THOSE- THOSE LAWS REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES. IT'S IN GIVE IT A FRESH LOOK. I THINK WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK BROADLY I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WE WON'T BE WILLING TO- TO CHANGE BUT I THINK WE ARE JUST IN GENERAL WILLING TO LOOK BROADLY INCLUDING DIALOGUE. WITH ALL OF YOU WHO HAD. YOU KNOW A ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF THE OF THE OF THE REGULATIONS AND THE BOARDS THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SO I THINK A- YOU KNOW AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT- SO THERE I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME THINGS THAT WILL BE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND OTHER. THINGS MAKE MAY BE LESS SO. WHAT HOPE THAT YOU WILL. I MEAN HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THIS FROM. AND INFORMATION FROM FROM FROM THIS- FROM SAID THAT COALITION OF FROM THE REALTOR TO RETAILERS ON SUPPLY CHAIN. OF THE CATHOLIC COLLECTION RESPONSIBLE GOODS MOVEMENT MAYBE THAT WILL SPUR SOME CONVERSATION I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO. HAVE A HEART TO HEART. ABOUT THAT WHAT. WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN OF ITSELF- NOT ONLY CURENTLY BUT- FIRST- RETROSPECTIVELY AND THEN OF COURSE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE AS WELL- AND I WILL ALSO MENTIONED AS- MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT- I DO THINK THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- BUT HAVING THE PORTS GOES WAY FOR SEVEN IS. AN IMPORTANT. BUT IT HAS TO ALIGN WITH THE WAREHOUSES OF THE- THE WAREHOUSES ARE NOT. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OR IF THE HOURS ARE NOT ALIGNED. A TRUCKER TO PICK SOMETHING UP AT NINE PM BUT IF THE- IF THE WAREHOUSE IS AN OPEN AT NINE PM. THAT'S A PROBLEM TOO RIGHT- OF THE SECTOR JIM WE SPENT SOMETIME TOGETHER TALK ABOUT THIS- YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE HEAT THERE WAS A DECISIONS CAN BE MADE ON INCREASING THE WEIGHT LIMITS- TEMPORARILY WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE OF WHEN THAT DECISION WILL TAKE PLACE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN I THINK WE SAW EACH OTHER ON THE DAY YOU GOT EGO WATER CAME OUT ON TOP RIGHT. SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLS ON CALTRANS TO IDENTIFY. AND PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL FREE ROUTES THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR HEIGHT WEIGHT LIMITS. I THOUGHT THAT'S A THIRTY DAY EXERCISE SO WE HAVE UNTIL I BELIEVE IT'S NOVEMBER NTIETH GIVE OR TAKE- CALTRANS IS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT- THEY WILL REACH OUT TO INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS- TO GET SOME INPUT. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME CALTRANS WILL BE PREPARED. TO ISSUE THOSE PERMITS FOR ROUTES THAT ARE THAT ARE. ULTIMATELY DESIGNATED FOR A HIGHER WEIGHT LIMIT. I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I GUESS MY COMMENTS ARE THE SAME- TO U. S. IT'S A- A DIRECTOR MYERS THAT. THAT RAIL AND TRUCKING ARE VERY IMPORTANT PARTS THE MAIN THEIR KEY ESSENTIALS THAT- TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. I WOULD HOPEFULLY- HOPEFULLY WILL ENCOURAGE YOU- AND HOPEFULLY WILL. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. REEVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES ON THE- ON THE RAIL TRUCKING- SIDE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND BEGIN TO LOOSEN- SOME OF THOSE ANCHORS I THINK THAT ARE. CREATING CHECKPOINTS AND IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN- I WILL ASK. ONE LAST QUESTION WHICH IS. HE MENTIONED THE LOAN ASPECT- TO- TO THESE IMPROVEMENTS AT THE PORTS- AND IT MEANT AND I THINK- I THINK PRESENT. A WINE MENTION THIS EARLIER THAT- OTHER STATES ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT LOANS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GRANTS AN INDIRECT INVESTMENT TO THE PORTS TO IT TO INCREASE THEIR- THEIR CAPACITY. IS THERE A DISCUSSION WITHIN THE MINISTRATION AND SOMEONE WHO IS THE VICE OR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I WOULD OF COURSE BE SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT STATE INVESTMENT- INTO- THE PORTS INTO HARD OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. IS THERE DISCUSSION- WHAT ABOUT STATE INVESTMENT. BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AND PER THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- WE ARE TASKED WITH- PULLING TOGETHER BUDGET CONCEPTS THAT COULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND TO ADDRESS SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS TO OVERALL SO- MORE TO COME. SURE I KNOW YOU SAY THAT I DO ECHO AND SHARE THE CHAIRS CONCERNED ABOUT THESE AGENCIES THAT AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE IMPACTING- THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT. SOMEHOW OUR IMMUNE FROM FROM OUR ACTIONS AS THE LEGISLATURE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE THE ELECTED BODY- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANKS VERY MUCH. GREAT DAY THANK YOU MR FONG I JUST BE CARE WITH THAT TOO BECAUSE I THINK IS. A SURE THAT THIS NEW DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE I'VE GOT BRIDGES VERY LARGE BRIDGES MY DISTRICT. AND WE MIGHT NOT WANT TRUCKS TRAVELING OVER THOSE BRIDGES MOVING CREASE WEIGHTS SO AGAIN THIS IS ON A BROAD STROKE THAT I'M CALLING FOR AS MUCH AS THERE ARE INSTANCES. WHERE WHERE WHERE WE DECIDED I SHOULD BECAUSE I CERTAINLY I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU GRACIA THANK YOU AND AGAIN JUST WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE RIGHT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO LAUGH CURRENTLY THE RATE UNANIMOUS ORDER- BECAUSE I'M NOT HANNAH. SADDAM. BUT I- BUT- I JUST. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF EXTRA. THIS LICENSES THAT'S ACTUALLY. A BIG DEAL. AND THAT'S- SEEM. YOU KNOW. SOMEBODY WHATEVER IT. BUT THAT IS A BIG BIG BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING. I'VE BEEN HERE FROM THE TRUCKING. THEY GET PEOPLE TRAINED. YEAH WAIT. SO MANY WEEKS TO GET THE LIGHTS. OF COMMERCIAL. IS A PERSONAL TO MY RIGHT. SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- AND I KNOW WHAT WE ALL THERE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW- TEMPTING TO TRY TO GET RID OF ALL REGULATIONS AND LAWS DURING TIMES OF CRISIS- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST NOT GONNA WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND DO THE WORK THAT THE LOT OF US- HAVE WORKED ON. AND WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD EXPECT SOME ACCOMMODATIONS DURING TIMES OF CRISIS BUT I ALSO HAVE SOME. THOROUGHFARES I DON'T KNOW THAT I WE WANT THEM TO BE HEARING ABOUT THE POTHOLES IN THE AND THE OVERPASSES COLLAPSING WITH THE EXTRA WEIGHT SO CASE BY CASE I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE POINT MAYBE TO MS MYERS I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOOKING UP. AND GOING FORWARD PROSPECTIVELY- THAT WE DON'T JUST KIND OF KEEP RECREATING WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS PUTTING MORE WEIGHT ON TRACK. VERSES LOOKING BIGGER AND AGAIN. GOING TO THIS SOME OF THE SMALLER INLAND PORTS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THE SMALLER CONTAINERS THERE ARE WERE ALREADY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE WORK TO EXPEDITE. SOME OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO HELP TREMENDOUSLY WITH EXPORT ESPECIALLY AS IT AS IT RELATES TO WIND TO ADD PRODUCTS TO TIMBERED A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE COMING DOWN. FROM THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE- SO JUST AGAIN IT ENCOURAGING US IS AND YOU'RE GOING FORWARD AND LOOKING AT THE TASK FORCE. TO LOOK UP TO LOOK BIGGER AND TO LOOK AT HOW ON DOING THINGS IN WAYS WE HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY DONE THEM WILL BE A GOOD PATH FOR RESILIENCY. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THOSE CON SENATOR I MEAN I THINK IT FALLS UNDER THE HEADLINE OF FOR THE CATEGORY OF NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE AND I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH. HOW WE'RE THINKING HOW AND I THINK IT OPPORTUNITY IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO INVEST AND TO DO IT IN A HOLISTIC WAY RIGHT A PROGRAM OF PROJECTS SO THAT THEY REINFORCE EACH OTHER AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER GOING FORWARD TO BE CREATIVE. YOU KNOW MORE VIBRANT AND RESILIENT SO PROPS TO PLACATE ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW BOTH INLAND WATER PORTS AS AS WE DISCUSSED BUT ALSO THE INLAND. LAN PORTS WOULD WOULD WOULD BE IT WOULD BE AN INNOVATION THAT YOU KNOW WOULD BE A POTENTIAL PROJECT WE COULD INVEST IN AND WOULD CERTAINLY. HELP FACILITATE MOVEMENT IN A MORE. HOLISTIC MANNER THAT COULD REALLY SUPPORT LONG. TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH LOS STATE AND- UNION DOING ITS- WIDE WE- IS. PART OF THE- OF THE OF. HERE IS WE COME OUT OF THIS HOW DO INVEST IN. OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A WAY TO PUT. OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST IN THE COASTAL AREAS. BUT THOSE AS WELL AS THE INLAND AREAS OF NORTH AREAS OF THE STATE. SO IT IS A WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN OUR OUR HUMAN OFFICIAL STRUCTURE AND EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT. AS WE LOOK AT SOME AREAS THAT HAVE HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER- INVESTED IN THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. SPREAD SPREAD THAT AROUND THE STATE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE VERY CREATIVE THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMING OUT OF A CRISIS BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULDN'T WASTE ONE MEMBERSHIP COME OUT BETTER THAN BEFORE AND NOT JUST. REINVENTING THE SAME HOLE THAT WE DUG OURSELVES INTO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ANYONE DOWN THERE NO SINGLE HANDS UP. OVER HERE MISTER GIBSON. YEAH YOU KNOW AS A TEACHER YOU KNOW I ALWAYS RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK SO. GIVEN THE PROGRAM GUYS. DELIVER AT LEAST TWELVE YEARS SO. MAYBE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION REALLY APPRECIATE IT BUT- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE EAST COAST PORTS WEST COAST PORTS IS THERE ANY SIMILARITY I KNOW THAT- ON THE EAST COAST TO CONSIDER OPERATING COSTS AND THE CALIFORNIA THEY'RE CALLED LIMB MORE PORTS- ARE THERE ANY SIMILARITIES. DIFFERENCES OR LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- BECAUSE PEOPLE- WORD ON THE STREET IS THEY FEEL LIKE THE CONGESTION ISSUES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE ASPECTS FROM ON THE OPERATING CORDS- INSURE THE CALIFORNIA STATE CALIFORNIA INTERVENE- TO HELP- MOVE THINGS ALONG WORKING TOGETHER WITH OTHER PARTS I AM AND I'D HATE TO LOSE IN THE MARKET SHARE. RT'S COAST PORTS AND SO DO YOU HAVE ANY- INSIGHT ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANKS FOR THE QUESTION WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND NOT SURPRISINGLY. EVERY STATE HAS HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE GOVERNING STRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN VIRGINIA WHERE I USED TO LIVE. IN OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA. IT'S THE STATE THAT OWNS AND OPERATES- THE REPORTS IN THEIR IN THEIR IN THEIR STATE. THOSE ARE STATE ENTITIES THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE ARE NOT SUGGESTING WE GO THAT DIRECTION. BUT IT JUST POINTS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY PORTS ARE MANAGED. OWNED AND OPERATED- AND SO THAT'S JUST ONE INTERESTING DATA POINT- AND GETTING BACK TO A PREVIOUS CONVERSATION- INLAND PORT. WE DON'T HAVE AN INLAND PORT. WE NEED ONE. AND SO- THERE IS A CALIFORNIA INLAND PORT PROPOSAL BEING DEVELOPED BY FRESNO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS- WE HELP THEM GET A ONE MILLION DOLLARS- GRANT FROM THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION- TO HELP FURTHER DEVELOP THAT FEASIBILITY STUDY- THIS HOLD GREAT PROMISE AND- IN FACT THERE PROPOSAL. WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS BECAUSE AN INLAND PORT. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WOULD DO. WONDERS IN TERMS OF RELIEVING CHOKEPOINTS. AND FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF CARGO FROM THE SENATE PETER BAY PORTS UP TO NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BY TRUCK. OR RAIL AND SO WOULD YOU MIND JUST CLARIFYING I UNDERSTAND WHAT INLAND PORTS MEANS BUT I THINK MAYBE PEOPLE WATCHING. HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING YOU'RE IN FRESNO YOU DON'T HAVE A POINT. CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY THAT PLEASE AND ALSO SEE THERE ARE SOME INLAND PORTS. YEAH CORRECT YEAH THANK YOU SO. HILLARY INLAND FOR DOING SO STILL IS A GREAT EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE. IS AN INLAND PORT THAT SERVES. AS A DESTINATION FOR CARGO COMING FROM THE PORTS OF ST OF LA LONG BEACH AND OTHER PORTS- THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BY TRUCK OR RAIL- THAT CAN THEN BE SENT- TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY STATES HAVE AN INLAND PORT- NOT WATER FOR BUT INLAND PORT- AND WE NEED ONE. AND SO THERE ARE PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE TO DO TO DO THAT. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE ARE ALSO PROPOSALS TO DO THAT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO ADDING ADDITIONAL TOOLS ADDING ADDITIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN MECHANISMS WILL HELP. BUILD THE NETWORK AND HELP ADD RESILIENCE TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK. AND WE SEE- SO IT'S IN THE CUT CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW WITH FRESNO- I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER SOMETHING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST SAYING. THANK YOU I MISS BONTA DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YES THANK YOU SECRETARY KIM FOR YOUR ADVOCACY- AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO A BUILD ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN JUST THE RECOGNITION THAT WE CONTINUE TO UNDER INVEST IN OUR PORTS STRUCTURE- AND A HOPE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO. INVEST IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WEEK THOUGH IT WE NEED TO I ALSO WANT TO JUST APPRECIATE MISS MYERS COMMENTS ABOUT THAT THAT THAT THAT EVERY STAKEHOLDER IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS GOING TO NEED TO STEP UP AND I'M GOING TO. I CONTINUE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO BE AN INCREDIBLY BROKEN RECORD ABOUT THIS BUT- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THT IN THE PORT THE PORT OF OAKLAND STANDS EMPTY RIGHT NOW I AND IS AN UNUSED ASSET- TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO REALLY APPRECIATE. ADS WERE THINKING ABOUT REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS THAT WE ALREADY USE THAT THE ASSETS THAT E HAVE IN BEING ABLE TO MOVE IT TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN THAT- AND ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE. STRUGGLING IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW S BECAUSE OF THE DEREGULATION OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT HAS HAPPENED- AND THE MISCLASSIFIED MISS CLASSIFICATION OF OUR TRUCKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CAUSING ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. THANK YOU RESPOND I JUST KNOW AB FIVE SOME. LO BEFORE. THIS BEGAN. I WITH THAT- FIRST SENATOR DAHLE. THE USE CHAIR NOT SO. I THINK IF THERE I HAVE A QUESTION A QUESTION WOULD BE- IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT YOU IT WOULD MAKE THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SPEED UP IN AND OPERATE MORE WHAT WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THAT ONE THING WOULD BE. I THINK MOST OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM AGREED THAT IT'S GETTING. CONTAINERS OFF THE PORT SCRIPT FINDING EXCESS SPACE EITHER IN THE PORT COMPLEXES ARE OUTSIDE THE COURT COMPLEXES. WHERE YOU COULD TEMPORARILY STORE FOR TRANSPLANTS FOR CONTAINERS SO THAT SHE COULD. CREATE MORE VELOCITY IN THE SYSTEM AT THE PORTS. I THINK THAT THAT THAT MEASURE MAJORITY STAKEHOLDER POINT IN THAT DIRECTION. SO WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A LOT THANK YOU. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT FACT THAT. YOU KNOW SOME REGULATION AND SO I HAPPEN TO BE IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS MYSELF. AND TO THEIR WORST A TRUCKING SHORTAGE OF THE PEOPLE I SAY I THINK OUR BIGGEST INVESTMENT NEED TO BE IN PEOPLE AND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE GET THOSE PEOPLE. INTO THE JOBS THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND SO FOR THOSE OF US IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS THIS BEFORE- COBIT IN. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN THE TRUCKING. WORLD AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS A LACK OF TALENT TO BE ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE IN AND ACTUALLY OPERATE THESE. TRUCKS ALONG WITHOUT A LOT OF REGULATIONS CHANGED- AND WE'VE HEARD AB FIVE IT WAS HUGE. IT IMPACTED A LOT OF THE TRUCKING BUSINESS. I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING I DON'T THINK THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION OR- THEY'RE GONNA BE ROLLING THAT BACK ANY TIME SOON BUT THOSE WERE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE- BASICALLY. THAT CHANGE THE WAY THE RULES WERE OR ARE. BEING IMPLEMENTED SO- SO THAT THAT BEEN AROUND FOR SOE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT- IMPLEMENTING YOU KNOW CDL LICENSES EASIER QUICKER I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS THAT WE HAPPEN YOU'RE GONNA ADD WEIGHT TO A TRUCK. AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT IN OFFICE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT EXPERIENCED AS MUCH AS SOME IN A TRUCK THIS NOW GOT EVEN MORE WEIGHT ON IT I MEAN I THINK THAT'S- A RECIPE FOR- IN SOME DANGER ON THE ROADS. AND ALSO TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SET UP FOR. TYPICALLY AN EIGHTY THOUSAND POUND. GVW UNLESS YOU SPREAD IT OUT OVER LONGER LINKED OF AXLES SO- I'M I'M IN FAVOR OF THAT ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME THOUGHT PUT INTO THAT PROCESS BUT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK WE FACE. AS THE LACK OF TALENT AND OF AVAILABILITY AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S DUE TO. I THINK SOME OF THE LAWS AND THE PETITIONS THAT WE'VE DONE HERE AND WITH ALSO THE WITH THE EXTENSION OF. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR EVER I MEAN WE'RE LIKE I CANNOT TELL YOU IN EVERY BUSINESS I GO BY IS LOOKING FOR PEOPLE AND WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO LET PEOPLE. DRAW UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK WHEN THERE'S JOBS AVAILABLE. SO IS THERE ANY BEEN ANY THOUGHT PUT INTO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN THE WORK FORCE- SINCE THE PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT. ON ALLOWING PEOPLE TO JUST STAY HOME. YEAH WELL I MEAN WE HAD IS A LONGER CONVERSATION I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE IT WITH YOU OFFLINE BUT I THINK WE HAVE LOOKED EXTENSIVELY AT THE CAUSES OF- SOMETIMES IMBALANCE IS IMBALANCES IN THE JOB MARKET AND WHY WE CONTINUE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT- I THINK THAT MOST ECONOMISTS AGREE AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE COUNTRY AT AT AT AT AT STATE WITH A ROLL BACK ON EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. UP EARLIER THAN THAN WE DID THAT THERE'S THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE CAUSE AND EFFECT- I THINK THE REASONS PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WE WE'VE HAD KIND OF A OF A LITTLE BIT OF A ON EVEN RETURN TO- JOB GROWTH ALTHOUGH JOBS ARE GROWING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION IN JOB GROWTH RIGHT IT IT'S WITH YOU KNOW SINCE JANUARY IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS A MONTH- BUT I THINK WE- WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT WHILE INVESTING IN JOB TRAINING AND OTHER THINGS. TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE THAT TRANSITION BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND TO GROW JOBS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FIT THAT WERE YOU KNOW MANAGING ECONOMY WAY THAT ALLOWS JOBS TO GROW ITSELF YEAH WE AGAIN THAT RESULTS A LITTLE UNEVEN BUT THE TRAJECTORIES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I'M HEADED TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH WITH YOU. AT ANY TIME MY PLEASURE THAT THE ONE THE ONE THING I THINK THAT IS YOU WILL TALK ABOUT. AYE MY FRUSTRATION WITH GOVERNMENT AS WE JUST THROW MONEY AT IT THINK IT'S GOING TO FIX IT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS FIX THE PROBLEM- OBVIOUSLY HELPS AND THE THINGS THAT THAT ARE PROPOSED OR LONG TERM RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CRISIS RIGHT NOW. AND SEND AND THE SHORT TERM I THINK HIS OBVIOUSLY WE NEED MORE SPACE RIGHT FOR THE- CONTAINERS AND NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THOSE CONTAINERS. THE REAL SHORTAGES THIRTY THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS AND IN CALIFORNIA ALONE AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A MILLIONS NATIONWIDE THAT WERE SHORT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET FIXED EITHER OVERTIME OVER A QUICK TIME RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THE RATES ARE GOING UP THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR PAYING. TOP DOLLAR FOR QUALIFIED DRIVERS RIGHT AND I DID IT IS THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF THE FOR SURE ONE OF THE TRUMP POINTS IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS FOR HOW TO VESTED OVER THE LONGER TERM- IN THE MEANTIME WHICH HAVE TRY TO GET THINGS MOVING AGAIN AND HOPE THAT THAT WORKFORCE AND. AND THEN MY LAST POINT WOULD BE THIS IS JUST TO STAY A MAN IS THAT. IN THE REGULATORY. IS REAP THREE POWER THOSE A QUICK. UPGRADING YOUR- TO MEET THIS STANDARDS OF THE PORTS- IS NOT JUST FOR SMALL BUSINESS FOR LARGE BUSINESSES A HUGE IMPACT AND SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES. ARE I MEAN WHEN YOU I LOOKED AT THE- EXECUTIVE ORDERS TALK ABOUT A THOUSAND DRIVES TEXT BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY THOSE TODAY. THEY'RE NOT EVEN AVAILABLE. IF YOU HAD HIM SITTING THERE. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT. YOU CAN GO TO THE LOT AND PICK THOSE UP. SO THOSE ARE THESE ARE LONG TERM RIGHT- SOLUTIONS TO WE NEED A SHORT TERM FIX FOR RIGHT NOW AND THAT I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER PORTS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- BEING ABLE TO NOT. IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. CHANGE ALL THE RULES BUT FOR THE SHORT TERM WE NEED SOME RELIEF SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THEN DO. THE LONG TERM EFFECTS THANK YOU. THANK IT IS ONE HIGHLIGHT THE RESPONSE YOUR FIRST QUESTION. WHICH IS THE ONE THING WE CAN DO. AND THE RESPONSE WAS GET THE EMPTIES PAPA DOC- AND HOW THAT'S DONE IT'S DONE A VARIETY WAS ONE OF THEM ONE OF MAIN WAYS IS THE SENT OVER SWEEPER SHIPS. RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY TAKE HIM BACK. TO THE IMPORTER RIGHT TO GO BACK WE NEED TO GET THOSE OFF THE DOCK THAT'S WHAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE. BECAUSE WITH HIS SITTING THERE TOO LONG- THAT THEY WANT TO ATTACH THAT FEE SO THERE'S AN INCENTIVE. FOR THOSE FOLKS TO GET THOSE EMPLOYEES OFF THE DOCK. WITH SO MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I'M GONNA TRY TO EXPEDITIOUS THAT ALWAYS TO HAVE MORE- PANELIST THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MYERS AND ALSO SECRETARY CAMP- JUST TO PIGGYBACK WITH SENATORS SAY YOU MUST BE LOOKING AT MY NOTES- WITH RESPECT TO- THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A SHORTAGE THERE WE ARE IN NEED MAKE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO TRUCK DRIVERS BECAUSE AS I LOOK FROM MY LIENS- VISITING THE PORT SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE PRESIDENT- DID EXECUTIVE ORDERS WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND CONTAINERS- ON THE DOCK- AND NOT ENOUGH TRUCK DRIVERS TO MOVE THAT STUFF AND THEN WE HAVE. FIFTY TO SEVENTY TRUCK- SHIPS OUT AT SEA WAITING TO GET IN AND SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK THAT WE CAN FIX- BUT THIS LEADS TO MY QUESTION AND MY QUESTION IS WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SCRATCH OUT THE WERE POSSIBLE WE NEEDED TO HAPPEN WE IDENTIFIED. A FREAK OR GOODS MOVE MOVEMENT A KEY PERSON IN THE HORSESHOE THAT CAN COORDINATE THE AGENCIES GO BEARS- CAL S. T. A. AND ALSO CARBON OTHERS BECAUSE GOING BACK TO SHERMAN- O'DONNELL- HAS INDICATED WE HAVE A NUMBER OF POLICYMAKERS WE ARE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE GOVERNOR HAS THE AUTHORITY AS WELL AS CARBON OTHERS AND THERE'S NO COORDINATION AND THEN WE WILL THERE'S NO COORDINATION THERE'S CHAOS AND WE HAVE CHAOS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE NO ONE IS TAKING ALL OF THOSE AGENCIES CAN COORDINATING THEM AND MAKING SURE THERE IS A ABSOLUTE OF DELIBERATE- MATTER FACT PLAN TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT HAND RIGHT. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT LAND USE AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE OF THE DOZEN OR SO- OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN GO AND STACKS- BECAUSE I'M AFRAID BECAUSE I RIPPED AT THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITY WHICH IS WILMINGTON- CERTAINLY HOPE YOU HEARD SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE- THE YOU KNOW. THE- THE THIS TAX SO HIGH. AND IS DANGEROUS AND I'M A- AN OBSCENE A NUMBER. WITH RESPECT TO- THERE WAS ON OF EACH BUT THERE- I KNOW HORROR. WE ARE YOU DO IS HAVE A WIND BLOWING IT'S GOING TO TEETER TOTTER FALL OFF AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF THAT. YOU KNOW SAFETY IS NEEDS TO BE AN ISSUE- AND SO THAT'S A COMMENT BUT ALSO WHAT CAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO- TO HELP ESTABLISH MORE DOMESTIC- MATTER FACTORING OF CHASTITY'S. I'M HERE- THAT WE CAN REALLY- ENVISIONED AS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION. DO YOU DO I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ON THE CHASSIS QUESTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT DOES HAVE A THROUGHOUT THE DISPLACING TARGET TAKE A SHOT AT IT BUT I ALSO THE DIRECTORS OF THE PORT. I CAN SPEAK UP AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON STARTING OFF WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING. THE FEDERAL TOOL IS CALLED THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT. CAN BE INVOKED IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY OR CRISIS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID DURING COVERT THE EARLY DAYS OF CULVER TO. WRAP OF DOMESTIC SUPPLIES OF PPP. TESTING AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. THEORETICALLY IT COULD BE INVOLVED HERE AS WELL FOR TO- IN COURAGE GREATER DOMESTIC PRODUCTIONOF CHELSEA'S CONTAINERS- THAT IS SOMETHING- WE HAVE RAISED I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AND SEE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY FINAL LAST QUESTION IS LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE AS WE DEVELOP A PLAN TO ADDRESS WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW- I'M REMINDED OF A FOUR SIX SEVEN WIENER WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD TO- INITIALLY EXTRAPOLATES- ALL LOCAL OIL PRODUCTION THE CALIFORNIA- TO BASICALLY BE DEPENDED BY YOU KNOW A 100% RIGHT- AND AS YOU LOOK AT. HOW THAT IS DONE UNDER THAT PARTICULAR BILL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR HUNDREDS BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER BE PRODUCING HERE IN CALIFORNIA EXPRESSLY WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT ABILITY TO HAVE THAT THAT CREW HERE WHICH MEANS TO ME. IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT IN FROM SHIPS AND IF YOU BRING IT IN FROM SIPS IN OUR PORT THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE OVER FOUR HUNDRED COMING IN AT ONE GIVEN TIME SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR PORTS. AND INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN OUR PORTS- WITH THE POLICIES WE ARE NOW- MOVING FORWARD IN THE STATE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I THINK WE DID THAT BUT THAT WOULD POTENTIAL CREATE MORE DEMAND ON THE PORTS AND- PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING THAT DIRECTORS CORDERO AND- AND THE STRUGGLE CAN CAN SPEAK TO MORE. OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BEING HERE TO CENTURY BEING HERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AS A LONG TERM PLAN ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT. IF IN FACT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE DOWN THAT ROAD. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH IS A HIGHLIGHT YOUR COMMENTS ON THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT WITH REGARD TO THE CHASSIS. THAT'S A BIG DEAL. BECAUSE AS YOU BEAT HIM AT LEAST A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE MADE. DOMESTICALLY WE HAVE RELATIVELY MINIMAL. CAPACITY THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE THOSE MOST OF THOSE ARE MADE CHINA SOME OF MEXICO. I GUESS  FEW IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT'S A BIG DEAL. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD ACT ON THAT- MR FONG. I'M FIVE ONE LAST QUESTION AND I THINK WAS SPURRED BY- MY CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT COORDINATION. WHO IS THE PERSON RIGHT NOW IN CHARGE OF DIRECTING- THOSE DECISIONS AND IS THE- ADMINISTRATION WILL. WILLING TO LOOK AT A SUPPLY. CHAIN PERSON- THAT COULD ADVOCATE. FROM THE BUT THE PUBLIC'S- PUBLIC SIDE TO HELP COORDINATE THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE WHEN WE- ARE IN. A IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS AND- HELP MAKE DECISIONS AS WELL AS STOP BAD IDEAS AND BAD. LEGISLATION FROM. FROM BEING PUT IN PLACE UNDER IN IN AND IT THE BIG AT THE BEGINNING CAN WE AVOID A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS I MEAN. IS THERE A PERSON THAT THAT SHOULD BE PUT IN CHARGE. WHO IS THAT PERSON RIGHT NOW. AND IF NOT WHO WOULD THAT PERSON BE. RIGHT SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR SHOULD THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HE ALSO ASKED US TO STAND UP AN INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE WHICH WE'VE DONE- INCLUDES- CAL STEP GO BIZ- I'M GONNA FORGET. ABOUT THE LIST IN FRONT OF ME BUT ALL THE REPRESENTATIVE AGENCIES INCLUDING CARP- IT'S CO CHAIRED BY ON A MONTH TO SANTOS AND MYSELF- BUT BUT IT HAS MY PROTESTS A PATIENT OF THE- OF THE SECRETARY LEVEL- REPRESENTATION. EACH OF THE AGENCIES INCLUDING AG- AND SO THAT IS RIGHT NOW THE BODY THAT'S COORDINATING ACTIVITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE MINISTRATION EFFECT AND WHAT. DIFFERENT PUBLICATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE. I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT WORK BETTER. AND WHAT IS THE RIGHT LONG TERM STRUCTURE- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A FINAL LONG TERM DECISION ON THAT THIS POINT BUT CERTAINLY- WORKING TOGETHER AT THIS POINT WITH THIS INTERAGENCY. GROUP TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS IN THE WAYS THE STATE CAN- AND LOOKING TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL AND OBVIOUSLY RETAIL AND- TRUCKING AND- IMPORT PARTNERS- EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION OUT OF THE GATE FROM. FROM PRISON ON IS. IS ONE IS THAT WHAT IS THAT PART BUT HOW DO. WE IMPROVE COORDINATION THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY THANK YOU.

AND HOW THE STATE CAN NOT JUST INFUSE DOLLARS BUT ALSO LOOK AT SOME. OF OUR OWN INGENUITY- TO BE ABLE TO APPLY TO THIS REALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE LIKE YESTERDAY. THANK YOU. YEAH IT'S A QUESTION I MEAN I THINK IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT SOME OF THE REALLY EFFICIENT PORTS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SHARE OUR- DIGITAL PLATFORMS RIGHT THEIR DIGITIZED IN A WAY THAT. THAT PRODUCES EFFICIENCY AND SO WE WERE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IN LOOKING AT THAT AND WORKING WITH OUR- WITH OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IN ITS PURPOSE. IS ONE OF THE- CERTAINLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INVESTMENT BOTH THROUGH THE- FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP BUT ALSO TO THE STATE AND AGAIN IT'S ONE REEMPHASIZED. THE GOVERNOR WE KNOW WE HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO COME UP WITH SOME. PORT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BY THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET AND SO IT'S ON EVERYBODY'S MINDS- DAVID YOU MIGHT HAVE. SOMETHING TO ADD. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- AND I THINK YOUR NEXT PANELISTS- GENE'S ROLE. IN MARIN CORNER WILL BE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. EVERYDAY FOR OPERATIONS IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH- TECHNOLOGY IS BEING OPTIMIZED TO- TO REALLY IMPROVE OPERATIONS. AND NOT JUST LA LONG BEACH PORTS BUT ALL THE OTHER PARTS WELL ONE EVENING.

BEFORE BEGINNING MY COMMENTS I WOULD BE REMISS IN NOT THINKING GOVERNOR NEWSOM. THANK YOU GOVERNOR FOR EXECUTIVE ORDER AND MANY TWENTY ONE TO HELP TACKLE THIS TRIPLE A SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. THE PARLIAMENT OF THE SECOND LARGEST CONTAINER PORT UNITED STATES TOGETHER WITH THE PRO LOS ANGELES THE SAN PEDRO BAY COMPLEX COUNCIL COUNTRY. REPORT HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. OF SEEKING A FRAMEWORK FOR EXTENDING HOURS OF OPERATION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WHAT THE GOAL OF TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. A FRAMEWORK I FIRST REFERENCE BACK IN JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN GIVEN THE CARPOOL FORECAST THAT WE- IN THIS INDUSTRY. YESTERDAY BY IN A DAY WE HAVE SEVENTY SEVEN CONTAINER SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE WAITING TO GET INTO EITHER THE BIRTH OF BIRTH YOUR TO LONG BEACH WELL OUR NEIGHBOR IN LOS ANGELES. THE RECORD WAS REACH A WEEK AGO WITH AITOR CONTAINER CONTAINER SHIPS AT ANCHOR. OR IN THE DIRECTOR RETURNS SO YOU MASS IN NORMAL TIMES WHAT THE NUMBER IT'S- IN NORMAL TIMES THERE'S ZERO SHIPS AND- KEEP IN MIND THANKS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN WORKFORCE THE PRO LONG BEACH HAS NOT SHUT DOWN. OR SINGLE DATA INDEPENDENT. ARE I'LL W. PARTNERS HAVE KEPT THE CARGO MOVING. AS THE MARINE TERMINAL OPERATORS AND TRUCK DRIVERS REAL WORKERS SHIP CREWS TUGBOAT CREWS AND THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN WORKFORCE NEEDLESS TO SAY. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL OPERATION THAT HAS BEEN A BALANCE AT ALL LEVELS. ANDERSON CHAIN WORKERS SHOULD BE COMMENDED AS A HELP THIS MORNING. MORE CARGO IS MOVING TO THE SPORTS. EVER BEFORE ONE NINETEEN A POOR LONG BEACH MOVED SEVEN POINT SIX THREE MILLION TWO YEARS IN TWENTY TWENTY REMOVED EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION OUR BUSINESS YEAR EVER AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE EXPECTED TO SET ANOTHER RECORD AND MOVE CLOSE TO NINE MILLION. OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. PETER BIG. IS FORECASTED TO MOVE TWENTY MILLION TO YOUR CONTAINERS IN THE COMING YEARS THAT'S REQUIRED IN MY VIEW. IT TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN. AS YOU HEARD FROM CAPITOL SPOKESPERSON DADDY ONE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE ON VOCAL. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS BATTLE. MY FOCUS TODAY WILL BE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE PORT IS DOING TO RESOLVE IT AND DISCUSS WAYS THE STATE COULD ALMOST RESOLVED THIS CAR A CRISIS OR FIND SOME SOLUTIONS. TERMINAL'S FREIGHT ARE RUNNING OUT OF SPACE WE NEED TO MAKE ROOM ON OUR TERMS WERE PARTIALLY FIVE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND CONTAINER UNITS SITTING IN THOSE WAITING SHIPS. WE NEED CARGO VELOCITY. SO WE CAN STOP TALKING ABOUT CARNIVAL VOLATILITY. LAST WEEK THE POOR LONG BEACH LOS ANGELES THAT WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A SURCHARGE FOR CONTAINERS LEFT TOO LONG ON THE TERMS. IN THE CASE OF CONTAINERS SCHEDULED TO MOVE BY TRUCK. OCEAN CARRIERS WILL BE CHARGED FOR EVERY CONTAINER TOOLING NINE DAYS OR MORE. CONTAINERS MOVING BY RAIL OCEAN KITCHEN- CARRIERS WILL BE CHARGED IF THE CONTAINER HAS DEVELOPED FOR MORE THAN SIX DAYS OR MORE. BEGINNING NOVEMBER. THE POOREST WOULD CHARGE WATER COMPANY WITH THE CARGO IN KIND. HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CONTAINER INCREASING IN A HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREMENTS PER CONTAINER PER DAY. ELECTION OF THE CITY WELCOME ADDITIONAL SOONER THAN NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHAT THE BACKING OF THE BUDGET MINISTRATION WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR REGIONAL OPERATORS TO EXPAND HOURS OF OPERATION. I NEED TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING DEBATE EVEN PRIOR TO THIS CRISIS. WHAT BIDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE I NEVER DID HE TO HELLO IT DOESN'T PORTRAY FOUR SEVEN SUPPLY CHAIN. I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR HIS SUPPORT WITH THIS BOLD JOHNSON. THE YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT THE PROLONGED BEACH IN SEPTEMBER AGREED TO A PILOT PROJECT TO EXPLORE A FRAMEWORK WHERE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO USED TO USED AS NEW OURS AT TTI TERMINAL. WE CALL THE LEAD SHIP OR WILL WE CALL THIS NATURE THE WHO CHEN. BUT FOR ABOUT THREE AND THE SEVEN A TEACHER. TRUCKERS IN CAR OWNERS NO THEY CAN BEAT THE TRAFFIC. USING THESE EARLY HOURS WHAT ARE SLOWLY WARMING TO BE EXPANDED ARMS. BARBARA THERE'S PLENTY OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE DELIVERIES DURING THE SHIP. THERE ARE CHALLENGES BUT I DO BELIEVE WE DO EXPECT SOME PROGRESS. WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE JOB CARTY HAS BEEN VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING LARGE RETAIL COMPANIES TO THE TABLE TO MOVE CONTAINERS DURING THESE EXTENDED HOURS. OTHER TERMINALS ARE FLASHING GATES THIS MEANS THEY'RE OPENING EARLIER AND STAYING OPEN LATER. SUMMER READING FRIDAY NIGHT AND WE CAN GETS. MEANWHILE AT THE POOR LONG BEACH ARE SHORT TERM OR FOR RESEARCH PROJECT KNOWN S. STORE. HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS FIRST IMPLEMENTED BACK IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. NOW THE SIXTY FOUR SUCH CITY FOR A GROUP OF SELLING AT THE PORT IS WORKING TO PROVIDE CONTAINER TRANSPORT AND TEMPORARY STORAGE DURING THIS CARD WILL SEARCH. TODAY IT HAS. FOURTEEN THOUSAND CONTAINERS AT THE SITE. WE ALSO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERSHIP A COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH OPENS A NEW LEADERSHIP OF DD BUYERS. ACTIVELY WORKING WITH POOR GERMANS TRUCKING COMPANIES TO IDENTIFY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND BUT ALSO CAN BE USED FOR TEMPORARY STORAGE DURING THE SEARCH. OUR TERMINALS ARE WRAPPING UP ON DR OPERATIONS A PRIORITY COMPONENT. TO THROUGH THE CAR WILL ALSO BE AND DIMINISH TRANSACTION IN OUR TRANSPORTATION I WHICH- REGROUP FROM ABOUT 20% EARLIER THIS YEAR. TO ABOUT 27% IN THE SUMMER WITH REGARD TO OUR ON DOCK OPERATIONS. ALONG THOSE LINES THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. THAT'S PARTNERED WITH THE UTAH INLAND PORT AUTHORITY IN THE TEMP TO INCREASE RAIL HAUL CARGO THIS WILL BE DONE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF COST EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES AIMED AT MOVING GOODS QUICKLY SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY BETWEEN LONG BEACH AND YOU TALK. WE ARE STILL GETTING COLD ISOLATION FOR INTERNATIONAL BURNERS SOME SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SAILORS HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. BY THE LONG BEACH HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON BOARD MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED SHIPS BERTHED AT BOTH PORTS. NOW BACK TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THOSE FRAMEWORK IT WILL MITIGATE THE CURRENT SURGE YEAH. CHALLENGING BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. IT WAS ALSO SERVED AS A PRIMER TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE. AS I HAVE INDICATED I BELIEVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN NEEDS A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE GIVEN THE VOLUMES THAT WE HAVE AND THE BOTTOM IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETION HERE TO CALL. REJECTION CHAU CARL WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE COMING YEARS. INTERNATIONAL TRADE AS WE ALL KNOW IS A MAJOR FACTOR AS TO WHY CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH. LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. FOR SOME CAN BE IMPLEMENTED OVERNIGHT OVER THE FLIP OF A SWITCH. IT TAKES A SERIES OF SWITCHES HOWEVER WE HAVE STARTED OUT AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER LEASES SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPLY CHAIN TO JOIN. THE-PARLIAMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT CAME ONLINE IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THE REPLACEMENT OF JOE DOESN'T BRIDGING TWENTY TWENTY IN THE- COMPLETION THE THIRD BASE BEEN OCCUPIED LUGGAGE CONTAINER TERMINAL IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH OMIT WHICH IMMEDIATELY ADDED. ONE MILLION TO YOUR COMPETITORS AT THE SPORT. PUSHES ME UP A BIT TERM. WHAT ARE THESE INVESTMENTS I ASSURE YOU WE WOULD HAVE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD MORE PRODUCTS. I WANT TO THANK SURGERY Q. AND A STOP WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE US DEPARTMENT CHARGER SECOND SECRETARY CHECK FOR PRIORITIZING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AND ADDRESS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. MOST NOTABLY TO PROLONG WHICH- PLANS ON INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS ON ON DECK BONDOC REAL PROJECTS. WE WILL HOPE THAT THIS WILL INCREASE NOW ON DECK OF UNCIA HONDA ACCORD WILL BID. TO ABOUT 35% JURBY OUR NEXT RENDON DEVER FOR INCREASED UNDER LOCK RAILROAD. REALLY AREN'T FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN USE AND IT WOULD. THE PROJECT WAS IN FASTER MOVEMENT. AND WILL ELIMINATE APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TRUCK TRIPS RESULTING IN LESS CONGESTION. AND TRUCKS IDLING IN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS AND BETTER AIR QUALITY. WELL WE INSTITUTE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND BUILD FOR THE FUTURE. BUT WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DO THIS ALONE. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE WHERE YOU'RE CALLING ME NOT NOT ONLY THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BUT OF COURSE THE NATIONAL FUND. THE PROBLEM IS RESPECTFULLY UPS THAT THE STATE'S SUPPLY CHAIN RELIEF INSTABILITY PACKAGE INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET. ON THAT NOTE INCLUDES FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING DEVELOPMENT OF A CHANGE OF IT'S QUITE CHANGES A DIGITAL SURPRISED. INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCREASE IN CAPACITY THE LAWSUIT EFFICIENCIES OF THE CALIFORNIA PORTS. AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS THAT THE STATE LOOK AT ONGOING CONTINUED SUPPORT. FOR THE SPORTS. SO WE CAN KEEP PACE FOR OTHER STATES REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND AGAIN. BIG PICTURE WE'RE CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THIS WORLD. AND AGAIN ON THE VALUE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND OF COURSE FOR THE PANEL MEMBERS WHO EXPRESSED THE SAME AND TWO OF. MANY HERE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT WE APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY GOING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN EMPHASIS OF WHAT IS SUCH A CENTRAL PARK RATIO NOT ONLY FOR AGAINST YOUR CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE NATIONAL ECONOMY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU EXECUTIVES MARIO CORDERO NEWS MOVED TO SOREL. WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES MISTER SOROKA WHEN READY. MISTER STROKE CAN YOU HEAR ME. ALL AREAS I HEARD SOME. YEAH CAN YOU FOR STEVEN READY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE A GREAT THANKS A LOT MY NAME IS JEAN SOROKA HUNG THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES CHIEF LOGISTICS OFFICER IN RESPONSE TO COBIT NINETEEN. I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE. MANY FOLKS HAVE CALLED THIS A CRISIS AND AN END OF DAYS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ACTUALLY THE STORY HERE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT IT DOES DATE BACK YEARS AND DECADES WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE NOW HAVE A SPOTLIGHT SHINED ON. FOR AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. IN MOST RECENT HISTORY THIS BEGAN ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WITH THE TRADE POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON. AND THE COUNTER TRADE POLICIES. PUT BACK IN THE AREAS OF RETALIATORY TARIFFS BY CHINA. THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF IMPORTS TO SPEED UP AND ORDERS ADVANCED SO MUCH SO THAT AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT MAY NOT BE REMEMBERED THAT OUR BUSINESS YEAR THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES FELL OFF A CLIFF. BY ABOUT SIXTEEN PERCENT. BENKOVAC NINETEEN HIT EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY. SHUTTING DOWN THE FACTORY COMMUNITY AND MOST OF CHINA AND SPREAD TO OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES. IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY THE BUSINESS AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES DROPPED BY AN ADDITIONAL NINETEEN PERCENT. SO EFFECTIVELY WHEN YOU WERE NOT IMPORTING. FINISHED PRODUCTS PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR FACTORIES FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OR MAYBE JUST ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR NORMAL IMPORT LEVELS. THEN SUDDENLY WE STARTED TO SEE MANY TRENDS HAPPEN. EMPTY CONTAINERS COME BACK TO OUR PORT COMPLEXES THE NEED TO GET THOSE BACK TO ASIA TO PRE POSITION THOSE ASSETS FOR WHEN THE FACTORIES OPEN. AND WE WATCH THIS VERY CLOSELY WE WATCHED ENERGY USAGE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND EVEN POLLUTION IN CHINA TO SEE WHAT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN ADDITION TO OUR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS. AND THOSE PHONE CALLS YIELDED ON A NIGHTLY BASIS. THEN THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER BEGAN TO SHOW AS EARLY AS JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. MANY OF US WERE WORKING FROM HOME. WE DIDN'T GO TO BALL GAMES OR MOVIES WHERE ARE GOING TO RESTAURANTS ARE FLYING TO SEE YOUR GRANDPARENTS. WE STARTED TO BUY ONLINE AND IN FACT OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ONLINE BUYING DOUBLED IN WHAT TOOK US IS AN AMERICAN CONSUMER TEN YEARS TO BUILT. RETAIL SALES CONTINUE TO FLOURISH IS WE'RE AT HOME WE BOUGHT SOFAS AND REFRIGERATORS OUTDOOR PATIO SETS IN MY CASE I BOUGHT A SET OF GOLF CLUBS AND SHOES BECAUSE MY GYM WAS CLOSED I NEED TO EXERCISE. REALLY HASN'T HELPED MY GAME BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CONTINUE TO BUY ALL THESE GOODS. STILL TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH AMERICAN CONSUMER DEMAND HAS NOW BEEN THE MESSAGE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST. YEAR IN A QUARTER. AND ALL DURING THIS TIME WE ALSO SAW THE AMERICAN EXPORTSLIMIT. HERE IN LOS ANGELES WE'RE NOW DOWN THIRTY ONE OF THE LAST THIRTY FIVE MONTHS ON EXPORTS. TRADE POLICY MONETARY POLICY WHICH HELPS US GREATLY IN SO MANY AREAS OF OUR ECONOMY IS A CHALLENGE FOR THOSE COMPANIES WERE TRYING TO COMPETE WITH OTHER TRADING NATIONS. ACROSS THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. AND IS MORE RECENT PHENOMENON OF PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON REMOVING AND MOVING OUT EMPTY CONTAINERS BACK TO ASIA AS ALL PUT PRESSURE ON THE AMERICAN FARMER. AND EXPORTER. AND TO ILLUSTRATE OUR SPENDING HABITS ARE DISCRETIONARY INCOME ARE GOING TO GOOD IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THOSE SERVICES AND WE CONTINUE AT A VERY HIGH CLIP IN THAT SPENDING. I ANTICIPATED SOME POINT WE WILL LEVEL OFF AND WE WILL GO OUT MORE AND MORE INTO THE SERVICE SECTOR IN FACT THIS MORNING'S REPORT. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOWS SERVICE SECTOR NUMBERS ARE UP AND ESPECIALLY THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR OF OUR BUSINESS STARTED TO SHOW SOME PROMISE WITH MORE HIGHER DURING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. CAN I TRANSLATE INTO MORE CARGO COMING THROUGH AMERICA'S LARGEST TRADE GATEWAY HERE IN LOS ANGELES WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT WE MAY MOVE AS MUCH AS ELEVEN MILLION CONTAINER UNITS THIS YEAR THIS WOULD BE AN ALL TIME RECORD. AND I KNOW COMPARISONS ARE KIND OF CLUNKY GIVEN THE RECENT TRAVAILS OF TRADE COBIT NINETEEN AND THIS IMPORT SURGE BUT THIS WOULD BE FOURTEEN PERCENT. OF ALL OF OUR ALL TIME BEST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND FOR A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE LOOK LIKE TODAY HERE AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING SIXTEEN VESSELS IN THIS IS AN AREA THAT HAS NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT MUCH YET. OUR PRODUCTIVITY FROM THE VESSEL SIDE IS UP 50% YEAR ON YEAR AND 80% COMPARED TO A SIMILAR TIME LAST YEAR OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS. THE AVERAGE LOADING AND UNLOADING OF A SHIP HERE IN LOS ANGELES IS ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CONTAINERS. AND THAT'S THE BEST OTHER INTERNATIONAL PORTS THAT MANY TALK ABOUT WORK YOUR GATEWAY HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN A SHIP COMES IN WE JUST CHARGE AND ITS ENTIRE CONTENTS AND LOAD BACK THAT ENTIRE SHIP AT ONE PORT CALL. NOT MANY OTHER PORTS AROUND THE WORLD DO THAT NOT EVEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES NOW HERE'S WHAT'S GOT EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION. TODAY WE HAVE NINETY SIX SHIPS AT ANCHOR SEVENTY OF THOSE ARE OF THE CONTAINER VARIETY. THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE CONTAINERSHIPS ARE DESTINED FOR LOS ANGELES THE OTHER HALF EXACTLY DESTINED FOR LONG BEACH BUT HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING WE'VE HAD TEN NEW ENTRANTS TO THE TRADE JUST THIS YEAR SEEING A BOOMING TRANSPACIFIC MARKET. NEED FOR CAPACITY ON THE VESSEL SIDE MORE FOLKS ARE COMING IN THOSE THAT PREDOMINANTLY WORKING INTER ASIA OR MIDDLE EAST LONG HAUL TRADES HAVE SHIFTED THEIR VESSELS HERE TO THE TRANSPACIFIC. NOW THE AMOUNT OF CARGO SITTING OUT ON THE SHIP ALSO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR MEDIA. IT IS THE EQUIVALENT RIGHT NOW. ALTHOUGH ABOUT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN SHIPS THAT OUR RECORD. AGAIN EVERY CONTAINER SHIP WE BRING IN AVERAGE IS A LITTLE MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CONTAINERS EXCHANGED YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SMALL SHIPS SITTING AT ANCHOR TODAY. FIFTEEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CONTAINERSHIPS THAT ALL GOING TO THAT BIG COUNT OF SEVENTY. AGAIN FOR LOS ANGELES IN LONG BEACH COMBINED WE WOULD LOOK LIKE WE HAVE THIRTY TWO SHIPS AT ANCHOR WHICH IS NOWHERE NEAR THE RECORD THAT WAS SET OF NINETY SEVEN. BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TO A VERY DIFFERENT TIME AND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS LOOKING FURTHER AT THIS CHART. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE DWELL TIME OF CONTAINERS CONTINUES TO INCREASE FOLKS THAT IMPORT ARE SITTING ON THEIR CARGO LONGER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. IN FACT WE'VE IDENTIFIED OUT OF THE SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND IMPORT CONTAINERS THAT ARE SITTING IN LOS ANGELES. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND HAVE BEEN SITTING FOR MORE THAN NINE DAYS AND SINCE WE MADE OUR ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS PENALTY FEE WE'VE GOT REQUEST TO MOVE NINETY FIVE HUNDRED CONTAINERS OFF PORT PROPERTY FOR LONG TERM STORAGE. THERE'S A MISMATCH HERE WE'VE GOT PATIO FURNITURE ON THE DOCKS WE'VE GOT CHRISTMAS TREES OUT AT ANCHOR FOLKS ORDERED A LOT OF PRODUCT OF THE- A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SECTIONS. ALL BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE FACTORY'S CAPACITY WOULD FILL UP. IF WE REMOVE THOSE THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND CONTAINERS FROM LOS ANGELES THE FLUIDITY RISES A MEDIA LIKE. MUCH IS ALSO BEEN SAID ABOUT THESE EMPTY CONTAINER ABILITY ON AVERAGE WERE MOVING THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPTY CONTAINER UNITS EVERY MONTH OUT OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. 30% MORE THAN WE DID A YEAR AGO OUR VESSELS ARE 75% EMPTY 25% EXPORT I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT EXPORT IN A MOMENT. BUT THESE DWELL TIMES ARE REALLY WHAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THE LACK OF FLUIDITY AGAIN WE'RE BREAKING RECORDS EVERY MONTH PRODUCTIVITY NOT JUST PR RECORDS. PRODUCTIVITY BY THE LONG SURE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE LOADING AND UNLOADING THE SHIPS IT'S LIKE TAKING TEN LANES OF FREEWAY TRAFFIC AND MOVING IN IN THE FIVE WE'RE STILL GOING PRETTY FAST WHAT IT'S ABOUT ABSORBING ARE DIGESTING ALL THIS CARGO INTO THE DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN. AS HAS BEEN COVERED THERE'S A PAUCITY OF TRUCK DRIVERS WERE SHORT EIGHTY THOUSAND ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS NATIONWIDE. AND IS RACHEL SAID EARLIER WE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WAREHOUSE JOBS OPEN AND OUR WAREHOUSES TWO BILLION SQUARE FEET FROM THE SHORES OF THE PACIFIC OUT TO THE DESERT REGION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE OVERFLOWING WITH CARGO. WE'VE CO MINGLED FULFILLMENT- ONLINE BUYING WITHTRADITIONAL WAREHOUSING AND CROSS DOCKING CAPABILITIES THESE WAREHOUSES NO LONGER. ARE ENOUGH TO CATER TO ALL THE CARGO THAT'S COMING YET SO WE'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT ON THOSE TWELVE TIMES AND THEY CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE OF CHASSIS. CONTAINERS ARE NOW BEING USED FOR STORAGE WHETHER THEY BE ON OUR DOCKS ARE OUT ON THE STREET MORE PRECIOUS CHASSIS IS UNDERNEATH THOSE CONTAINERS WE'VE GOT A SPEED THE LAWSUIT IN A HEALTHY AND SAFE WAY OF GETTING THOSE CONTAINERS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS IDEA OF LAND USE IS A GREAT ONE WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT NOW WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PARCELS OF LAND. STRING THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ITS MY ESTIMATE WILL BE BACK IN FRONT OF YOU IN ANOTHER MONTH AND A HALF TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN SCOOP UP ALL THOSE CONTAINERS AND. GET HIM BACK FOR AN EARLY LUNAR NEW YEAR. OUR NATION FIRST AND STILL ONLY PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM RESIDES HERE IN LOS ANGELES THE PORT OPTIMIZER. ONE OF ITS KEY DISTRIBUTORS OF INFORMATION IS THE SIGNAL. THESE ARE ACTUAL LOADINGS OF VESSELS SUPPLIED BY U. S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE SAILING. AND CALL A COMBINED WITH VESSEL MANIFESTS FROM ALL OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS ON THE LINER SHIPPING SIDE. THOSE NUMBERS KEEP ON COMING OUT WE HAVE TWENTY ONE SHIPS COMING IN OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS WHICH IS A BIG NUMBER. SO WE BEGAN WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BIKE THAT MINISTRATION TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR OWN MUNICIPALITY MONTHS AGO. ON A SHORT TERM FOCUS TO GET AFTER THE IMMEDIACY IS OF WHAT WE SAW WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO REDUCE TRUCK TURN TIMES INCREASE THE ROUND TRIPS ARE TRUCKERS AND LINER SHIPPING IMPROVEMENTS ON EFFICIENCIES. WE ROLLED OUT FOR NEW MODULES OF OUR INFORMATION SHARING SYSTEM DURING COPA NINETEEN DESIGNED BY INDUSTRY DEVELOPED AND DELIVERED FOR INDUSTRY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A TRUCK GATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND A DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION OR STORAGE PILOT MUCH AS BEEN MADE ABOUT POLITICIZING AND WEAPONIZING THE STORAGE CHARGES WERE GOING TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM F IT. AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND DOMESTICALLY ON FREE DATA ARCHITECTURE AND STANDARDS REGARDLESS OF WHO THE UNDERLYING TECH SERVICE PROVIDER IS SHARING INFORMATION THROUGH THE PORT OPTIMIZER IS MADE POSSIBLE TODAY. AND TO GET AFTER THE IMMEDIACY IS OVERSATURATION USING OUR EXISTING CAPACITY. 30% OF ALL TRUCK APPOINTMENTS EVERY DAY GO ON USED HERE AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS 50% GO UNUSED DURING THE WEEKENDS WE OF LATENT CAPACITY RIGHT NOW LONG SHORE MANY WOMEN ON THE DOCKS IN THE TERMINALS READY TO MOVE AS MUCH CARGO AS POSSIBLE LEADING BACK TO MY ORIGINAL THEORY SOME FOLKS DON'T NEED CERTAIN CONTAINERS RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT A SEGMENT THOSE TO THE SIDE. AND THAT'S WHY WE CREATED ACCELERATE CARDINAL LA TURNING WHAT IS TRADITIONALLY A PULL SYSTEM WE OPEN UP ON OUR HOURS OF OPERATION. PUT UP A SPREADSHEET FOR IMPORT APPOINTMENTS TO BE MADE BY OUR TRUCKERS AND WAIT FOR THEM TO SHOW UP WE TURN THE TABLES IT'S NOW A PUSH SYSTEM WE KNOW WHOSE CARGO IS HERE WHERE IT'S LOCATED AND HOW LONG IT'S BEEN THERE. A SYSTEM THAT WAS A HEAVY LIFT MANUALLY BUT NOW BEING DIGITIZED UNFORTUNATELY. OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IMPORTERS THE CALL LOS ANGELES HOME EVERY YEAR ONLY TWENTY COMPANIES TOOK US UP ON THIS PREMIUM SERVICE AGAIN. DO WE REALLY NEED THE CARGO IN ITS NOTS LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE PRODUCT TO MARKET THAT EASY AND NEAT. AND THAT'S WHY. AFTER MANY MONTHS OF COLLABORATION ORDER SHIPPING MEETINGS ON OPERATIONS WE CAME TO THIS FINAL AND LAST RESORT. AND THAT WAS CHARGING A PENALTY ON CONTAINERS THAT SAT NINETIES OR GREATR TO MOVE OUT OF THE TRUCK SIX DAYS OR GREATER ON RAIL AND AS I MENTIONED SINCE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAME OUT WITH A- REQUEST IN FOR MORE THAT NEARLY TEN THOUSAND CONTAINERS TO BE MOVED OFF DOCK AND STORED IN LONG TERM STORAGE FACILITIES. LONGER TERM WE MUST CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE ACROSS THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE VERY ACTIVE. WE NEED TO PRODUCE A NATIONAL PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM WE'RE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND OTHER TRADING NATIONS I WORKED OVERSEAS FOR ELEVEN YEARS IN ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR NATION'S COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH DIGITIZATION AND WE MUST CREATE A NATIONAL EXPORT POLICY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT REGULATION OR LEGISLATION THIS IS AN AREA TO GET THE AMERICAN FARMER AND MANUFACTURE BACK IN THE GAME. GET THE CALIFORNIA FARMER RECONNECTED WITH THEIR TRADING PARTNERS ANDCUSTOMERS OVERSEAS WE'VE BEEN TALKING AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AND I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME VERY INTERESTED PEOPLE. AND IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BUT WE'RE READY TO TURN. ON THE NATION'S FIRST AND ONLY WORKFORCE TRAINING CENTER. THAT WILL B RIGHT HERE AT THE NATION'S LARGEST PORT COMPLEX IT'LL BE ABLE TO CREATE A PIPELINE OF SKILLED LABOR AND IT'S WELCOME TO ALL ALTHOUGH ARE A LONG SHORT MEN AND WOMEN MARINE CLERKS FOR MEN ARE RIGHT HERE IN TOWN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WILL BE ABLE TO TRAIN TRUCK DRIVERS AND WELDERS. LOGISTICIANS AND FOLKS WHO WORK ON COMPUTERS THERE WILL BE A DAY PRETTY SOON THEN A MECHANIC NO LONGER WORKS WITH THE RANCH WITH A COMPUTER TO IMPROVE AND DIAGNOSTICALLY TEST EQUIPMENT. AND LASTLY IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BY DANNY ONE BUT WE NEED TO GET OUR FAIR SHARE THE INVESTMENT. AND WHEN THE CARGO TO TRAVERSE IS THE NATION'S LARGEST PORK REACHES EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR COUNTRY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR THE AMERICAN CITIZEN. ALL ROADS LEAD HERE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I MENTIONED WE'VE ROLLED OUT FOR NEW MODULES OF OUR NATION'S FIRST PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM. IS INTEROPERABLE WE WELCOME EVERYONE. AND WITH THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT LAND USE WE NEED TWO OR THREE STRATEGIC LOCATIONS THAT WE CAN MONITOR SECURE WHEN IT'S HAVE COMES TIME FOR BRING THOSE EXPORTS AND DECENT CHASSIS IS BACK WE HAVE A REAL BEAT ARE WHERE ALL THESE CAPITAL ASSETS LIE. AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED HELP IN THE TRUCK SECTOR TO MOVE ALL THESE CONTAINERS OUT THAT ARE NOT NEEDED TODAY. HALSALL THESE RETAIL GOODS PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR FACTORIES AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. IT'S LOS SOMETIMES BUT 20% OF OUR IMPORTS ARE REFERRALS PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR UNITED STATES MANUFACTURING IT WITH A WEAKER MANUFACTURING NUMBER TODAY. PART OF THAT LIES ON OUR SHOULDERS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING QUICKLY AT ACTIVATING EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED ADDITIONAL ACRES ON TERMINAL ISLAND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FAST. WE CAN SEE THIS IS A RETURN FACILITY FOR AT LEAST HAVE LONG SURE FLIP THOSE EMPTY CONTAINERS OFF GET A ROAD ABILITY CHECK ON THE CHASSIS. PICK UP THAT IMPORT AND MOVE OUT WILL MOVE THOSE INTO CONTAINERS OVERNIGHT WHEN THERE'S LESS TRUCK ACTIVITY TO LOAD RIGHT AGAINST THE VESSEL. AND WE NEED WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF ASSISTANCE WITH THE NEAR TERM ZERO EMISSIONS DRAYAGE TRUCK DEPLOYMENT WE CALL IT THE Z. TWENTY FIVE PROGRAM. WERE ACTIVELY SEEKING THE INPUT OF ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND CHEERED SUPPLIERS TO PUT THESE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD WITHIN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS. AND I MENTION THAT SUPPLY CHAIN DATA INTERCONNECTED BODY AGAIN WORK WITH OR WHATEVER PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANY YOU WANT BUT MAKE YOUR DATA PUBLIC AND WILL BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS HERE THE SMART. CARE GREAT THANK YOU TO THE TO OUR DIRECTORS- AND WHAT WE WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS VOTERS COULD HAVE SOME SHORT QUESTIONS SHORT ANSWER. IS WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS ROOM AND A BIT AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PANEL. MISTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON MY QUESTION WAS- FOR- CHEERS TO REGRET OR OR- DORAL COULD COULD GENERAL IN CHARGE- AND YOU KINDA ANSWERED IT ON IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF- THE CONTAINERACCESS TWELVE FEES AND HOW DID YOU SEE THAT ALL. REDUCING WAIT TIME FOR THESE CONTAINERS AT YOUR PORT BUT I GUESS MY REAL QUESTION IS WHAT INSURANCE DO YOU HAVE THAT THESE FEES JUST WON'T SIMPLY ARE COSTS TO THE CONSUMER AT THE END OF THE DAY. THANK CENTER. HE THE WASHINGTON YEAH I'M SURE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE WANT TO SPEAK THAT ORDER WAS. PASSED ON TO AMERICAN SHIPPING THIS WAS INTENDED TO CARE CITY TABLE TO ASSIST US AND COLLABORATE DOING. SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. MISSIONERS FOR COMP SO THAT WASN'T TOO OF DEFEAT LAST ALSO THAT I COULD BOTTOM LINE OKAY. THERE HAS BEEN SOME VERY GOOD COLLABORATIVE COME WE'VE HAD WITH THE- UP THERE TO ALL THEY CAN TO ENJOY THIS ISSUE SO HOPEFULLY YEAH. A LOT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE A- MASON FOREVER BUT I MEAN SHORT TERM WE'RE TO PUSH ALL THE BUTTONS TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS ARE WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE TO AGAIN INSTEAD. OF TO THIS ISSUE THAT WERE IN WE GET THAT'S BEEN ROCKED WORDED. LET'S LOOK. AT GLOBAL CRISIS BUT HERE THE NATION ARE PORK. THESE MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN AGAIN TO THE CAR OF. SENATOR I CAN'T YOU ANYTHING AT THIS IN TIME I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE NAY. RATE FOR. RECENT PUT OUT AN ANNOUNCED SAYING THIS WILL BE THE- RETAIL SALES YEAR EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. LINER SHIPPING COMPANIES ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS THIS YEAR RECORD MULTIPLE TIMES BEYOND THEIR BEST EVER YEARS IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE TWO THOUSAND. SIX AND OTHERS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN OR L. ALSO PROFITING FROM THESE RECORD VOLUMES FUELED BY THESE GREAT AMERICAN CONSUMER DEMAND AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. TO BRING IN A VERY FAMOUS PAIR OF BASKETBALL SHOES IN MORE NORMAL TIMES. COST TWELVE CENTS TO GET THEM TO THE STORE THAT YOU WHEN I BUY FROM. TWELVE CENTS PER PAIR ON A HUNDRED DOLLAR PAIR OF BASKETBALL SHOES LET'S GO ALONG WITH THE MEDIA FOR A SECOND AND SAY THAT NUMBER HAS DOUBLED TRIPLED EVEN CALL IT A DOLLAR. PER PAIR OF THOSE BASKETBALL SHOES IF THAT MONEY OF THIS HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE GETS PASSED ON TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER. OTHERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THIS BODY. SEOUL'S FEES WILL BE ASSESSED ON YOUR MEMBERS COMPANIES AS WALLER. THOSE FEES ARE GOING TO BE DIRECTLY ASSESSED AGAINST THE LINER SHIPPING COMPANIES THEY HAVE SKIN IN THIS GAME TOO THEY WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR MUTUAL CUSTOMERS AND AGAIN I TAKEN THIS DRASTIC STEP ON THE LOS ANGELES SIDE IS I HAVEN'T ALWAYS GOTTEN THE STRAIGHT STORY FROM SOME OF THESE IMPORTERS WE'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER IN THESE COLLABORATIVE ZOOM MEETINGS AND MAKING COMMITMENTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND CARGO IS NOT NEEDED WE'RE SUDDENLY UNDERSTANDING THE CARGO IS GOING TO BE MOVED TO THE SITE VERY QUICKLY AS THESE FEES APPROACHING THE NEXT ELEVEN DAYS SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONVERSATION MUST BE TRUTHFUL AND THERE IS NO SHAME HERE IF YOU DON'T NEED YOUR CARGO NOW WE SIMPLY ASKED IT BE MOVED ASIDE BECAUSE THINK OF THAT. SMALL THIRD GENERATION FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS THAT IMPORTS TEN CONTAINERS OF TOYS A YEAR THEIR ENTIRE PAYROLL DEPENDS ON THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS WE HAVE TO DELIVER TO THAT COMPANY. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. MISTER WRONG. I'LL JUST BROKE ALL MY QUESTIONS IN A WAY INTO INTO- INTO ONE I THINK I'VE THREE QUESTIONS YOU CAN ALL- YOU CAN CHOOSE BUT WHICH WAS ONE ANSWER BINDING GENE YOU MADE IT A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT THE IMPACT. OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN ON MANUFACTURING THAT WE FOCUS ON THE IMPORTS WE FOCUS ON AGRICULTURE BUT THE INVENTORY DELAYS CAUSED BY- THESE INTERRUPTIONS OR ARE SIGNIFICANT- ARE MAIN FACTORS IN IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA RELY ON JUST IN TIME DELIVERY AND MANUFACTURING. SO THESE SUPPLY CHAIN IMPACTS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR MANUFACTURING BASE AS WELL SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS HOW DO OTHER STATES INVEST IN THEIR PORTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN AND IS THERE A CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE MARKET SHARE BECAUSE OF THIS MY SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- MOVE FOR THE PORTS HOW IS THAT ALIGNED WITH THE HOURS AND THE WAREHOUSES AND HOW DO WE ALIGN. HOW DO WE MAKE THAT WORK AND THIRD ON THE LAND USE ISSUE- IF YOU HAD YOUR- ANALYSIS WHERE WOULD YOU PLACE- THOSE. TWO OR THREE INLAND PORTS AND WHAT WOULD BE THE HURDLES TO MAKE. THAT HAPPEN AND WHO WOULD RUN. DOESN'T MAGICALLY. THANK LET ME TELL MY PERSONAL FIRST EVENT THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. SOME IT ME LET ME SEE TO THIS COME. LET'S LET'S HAVE A HISTORIC CON TO WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING TO. LET ME TELL YOU THAT STOCKTON YOU'RE TWENTY TEN. JUDY TO CERTAIN TWENTY. DISSOCIATION AMERICAN STORY. AT A CONFERENCE AND A VERY RESPECTED ECONOMIST JOHN RECOMMEND. ADVISERS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THIS WAS THIS PREDICTIONS MADE ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND BY TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS IF WE IF WE DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND HAVE. NO TO ADDRESS WHAT HE PREDICTED WOULD BE NINETEEN MILLION PIZZA CONTAINERS IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. WELL MISTER RECOMMEND WAS ALMOST RIGHT ON POINT. AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A CRISIS BUT HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. OKAY DOLLARS. CHELSEA'S IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT SO TO YOUR QUESTION. I THINK IN MY SIX YEARS OF THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION BEING CHAIRMAN ARE IN WASHINGTON DC. I HAD A UNIQUE VIEW OF HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF THEM FOR EXECUTIVES AND THE BOARD OF THIRTIES AND ALL THE CEOS OF THE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS. AND IT IS FAIR TO SAY. THAT THE INVESTMENT IN SOME OF OUR COMPETITIVE PARTS. OF OUR EXCEEDED WHAT I SAW IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE GOOD NEWS I THINK THAT WE'RE HAVING A VERY PROPER CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS GOVERNOR AND THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE STAKEHOLDERS MARIJUANA AS HAS BEEN REPRESENTATIVE. WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS CRISIS OTHER LESSONS LEARNED OVER THIS CRISIS. PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY AND UP THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US. IS BACK IN TWENTY TEN LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE UNPREPARED TO ADDRESS TODAY. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WEREN'T WILLING TO HAVE A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THE REQUIRED INVESTMENT THAT'S NEEDED IN THE NATION'S LARGEST PORT COMPLEX. AND LESS I WILL SAY THIS. DURING DISAPPOINTED WAS DISRUPTED. FIRST OF ALL. DUE TO THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AT THE U. S. IN WASHINGTON WITH THE TRADE WAR. THAT COMMENCED AND ALREADY DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND MANY OF US SAID AT THAT POINT THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO ON THIS TURF ISSUE THAT WAS NOT. RECOMMENDED POLICY IT WASN'T- THE NEEDLE WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANS PACIFIC TRADE ROUTE THAT IS THE WEST COAST UNITED STATES TO ASIAN. I WANT TO REMOVE HERE I DON'T SEE IS GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ANYTIME SOON. SO WHAT. I JUST WANT EARNERS OF ALL THE QUESTIONS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WE KNEW YESTERDAY. SO MY ONLY SENSE OF URGENCY IS LOST NOT LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE. ROADS WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T GREAT PLAINS TO REMAIN AND CONSISTENTLY BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE GET TO EVEN GREATER THINGS TODAY WITH THE COMMENTARY HAS BEEN MADE TODAY SPECIFICALLY WITH SOME OF OUR STATE LEADERS LIKE DUCEY MYERS. AND SECRETARY DAVID CHIU. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE DOCKS IS SO CONTAINERS SITTING ON THE DOCKS SOME OF THOSE CONTAINERS ARE FULL OF GOODS. AND THEY'RE USING THE DOCK- THE VCOS OTHER WAREHOUSES ARE USING THE DOC'S ESSENTIALLY AS A WAREHOUSE. SO THOSE THOSE CONTAINERS ARE SITTING THERE FOR AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THERE'S ALSO EMPTIES ON THE DOCKS TO IS THAT ACCURATE. OUR EMPTIES TYING UP THE DOCKS. THERE'S A THERE'S THE THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SWEEPER SHIPS COULD YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT QUICKLY. SURE ALL ALL TAKE THAT LONG. I'M SORRY MARIO YOU FIRST PLACE. GOOD CUT YEAH THERE'S A LOT RECENTLY CHAIR OF- OF DANTE'S CLOGGING UP THE- CLOGGING UP THE SYSTEM WERE LOADING OUT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPTIES PER MONTH WHICH IS NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST ON RECORD BUT IT BEAT THE HIGH SET JUST LAST YEAR ON AVERAGE BY 30% WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED ON ANDY'S GOING BACK TO ASIA. WE'RE ALSO COLLECTING EMPTY CONTAINERS FROM NONTRADITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AT THE PRESENT TIME THINK OF SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC PORTS AS WELL AS GULF COAST PORTS TO SEND THOSE BACK AS FAST AS WE CAN TO WE GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE TRUCKING COMMUNITY AND OTHERS REPRESENTING THAT. THEIR EIGHTY THOUSAND CONTAINERS ON THE STREETS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THAT NEED TO BE RETURNED BY THE TRUCKING COMMUNITY THAT IS MANAGEABLE BUT WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE THE LINER SHIPPING NUMBERS ON HOW MANY MPS THEY'LL RECEIVE EVERY DAY PUBLIC INFORMATION THEN USE SOMETHING LIKE THE PORT OPTIMIZER TO DO JUST THAT. SOLVE THEY'RE NOT CLOGGING UP THE SYSTEM IN FACT IN LOS ANGELES TODAY WE HAVE SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND IMPORTS ON THE DOCKS. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EXPORTS AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND CONTAINER UNITS OF EMPTIES. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND REPRESENTS ABOUT FOUR DAYS OR FOUR DAYS WORTH OF WORK THE LONGSHOREMEN HAVE TO LOAD THOSE EMPTIES BACK UP ON TO THE SHIP AGAIN A VERY MANAGEABLE. NUMBER BUT AT THE SAME TIME PORT ENVOY GIAMPA COREY HAS BEEN IMPLORING THE LINER SHIPPING COMPANIES TO BRING IN SOME EXTRA MUSCLES AND EVEN MOVE THOSE AT THE SOUTH FASTER TO LOOSEN UP THE SITUATION. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU CORRECTLY SET SOME IMPORTERS. HOLDING ONTO CONTAINERS LONGER ON THE PORK THAT'S AN ADDED SEGMENTS ON THE STAR MAX THAT MAKES THE SITUATION A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER TO HAVE MANEUVERABILITY. AND IF I MAY GO BACK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG'S- THREE QUESTIONS- AS YOU SAW LAST WEEK WHEN YOU VISITED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE- THE- ACTIVITY OF THE DOCKS IS REALLY FAST. THINGS ARE MOVING QUICKLY IT'S GETTING THAT PRODUCT OUT THE GATE AND IF IT DOESN'T NEED TO GO NOW JUST MOVE IT TO THE SIDE FOR THE TIME BEING. INVESTED BY OTHER STATES THIS STARTED BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN MANY OF OUR IMPORT EXPORT COMPANIES BEGAN TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY CALLED A FOUR CORNER STRATEGY. OR POOR DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY TO DE RISK HAVING ALL THEIR CARGO GOING THROUGH ONE GATEWAY THE END RESULT. WE LOST 20% OF OUR MARKET SHARE SENSE THAT. AND ON THEIR BEHALF THEY HIRED REALLY SWITCHED ON PEOPLE THEY ALIGN THEIR EFFORTS AT THE PORTS WITH POLICY MAKERS AND LEGISLATORS. AND EVEN FORMED REGIONAL COALITIONS. IN ORDER TO GO TO WASHINGTON. OUTLINED LEGISLATION AND THEN APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR THEIR INVESTMENTS AND THEY'VE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY TAKE A FEW CUES FROM THOSE FOLKS. AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF US WHO WORK EVERY DAY 30% OR IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND WE ACCOUNT FOR. ABOUT A MILLION JOBS HERE ALONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ENVIRONMENTS THAT IT WAS A TELEGRAPH THE PRESS WHEN. MARIO AND I OUT THERE IN WASHINGTON ON THE THIRTEENTH OF OCTOBER TO MEET WITH HIM CABINET MEMBERS AND OTHERS. OTHER FOLKS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN WORKING ON THE SAME SCHEDULE WAREHOUSES TRADITIONALLY SAVE THE REALLY BIG COMPANIES WORK ON THE DAYSIDE. TRUCKERS ARE MANDATED FEDERALLY TO WORK ELEVEN HOURS A DAY IF THEY WERE CONSECUTIVELY THEY MUST TAKE A REST WE'VE GOT A TURN JUST THOSE TWO JOBS INTO PROFESSIONS AGAIN. MY GRANDPA WAS A TRUCK DRIVER HE'S A PROUD TEAMSTER WORKING FOR AMERICAN CAN COMPANY IN NEW YORK CITY. WORK FOR THEM FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN THIS INDUSTRY YOU COULD START OFF AS A BOX MOVERS WE CALL THEM IN A WAREHOUSE WORK YOUR WAY UP TO SUPERVISOR AND THEN ONE DAY YOU COULD MANAGE THAT WAREHOUSE WE'RE GONNA TURN THESE AROUND A LITTLE BIT. AND IS RACHEL SAID EARLIER THESE JOBS ARE PRETTY GOOD PAYING THEY CAN CREATE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS INCOMES BUT WE GOT TO ATTRACT RECRUIT. AND RETAIN FOLKS TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO IN OUR INDUSTRY AND LASTLY ON YOUR LAND LOCATIONS I WOULD SAY TO STRATEGIC SITES ONE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE BECAUSE A THIRD OF ALL OF OUR CARGO ON THE IMPORT SIDE GOES OUT TO THE I. E. FOR RE HANDLING AND- DISTRIBUTION. THE SECOND WOULD BE SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH EVEN IF IT IS. IN THE HIGHER LOW DESERT SO WE CAN GET OUT THERE WILL HAVE A SECURE ENVIRONMENT WOULD DATE AROUND WHERE ALL THOSE CAPITAL ASSETS ARE. AND WE COULD RETRIEVE THEM QUICKLY. IF THERE IS A THIRD DUE TO VOLUME NEEDS IT ALSO SHOULD BE A DECENT PROXIMITY LIKE A LOS ALAMEDA US. TRAINING CO TRAINING CENTER- JUST SOUTH OF THIS YEAR THE PORT COMPLEX- BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOW. ARE A NUMBER OF HUNDREDS OF PARCELS STREWN THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO COLLECT ALL THOSE CONTAINERS AND CHASSIS IS BRINGING A BACK. BUT ALSO AS WELL AS WAS SAID BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON EARLIER. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT SKILL SETS ON THOSE FACILITIES ARE THEY HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT TO MOVE AROUND ALL THOSE CONTAINERS WITH THEIR M. TIER LADEN. AND THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. I THANK YOU JEAN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND MARIO FOR THE HOSPITALITY YOU SHOWED ME WHEN I WAS THAT WHEN I WAS VISITING IN TERMS OF THE- 20% OF THE ALIGNMENT OF THE HOURS AND YOU. MENTIONED THAT THAT. THE STRUCTURAL pTHE DAYSIDE AND THE REST PERIODS ON ON THE ON THE- ON THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY- WHAT ARE YOUR SUGGESTIONS IF YOU. HAVE ANY TO TRY TO RE TO TRY TO REALIGN THOSE. IF IT IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS. WHAT I THINK THIS FORUM PROVIDES OF. VENUE FOCAL POINT TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT FRAMEWORK BECAUSE AGAINST THE BODY THAT WE HAVE TODAY- IS NOT TO GET ANY LESS EVEN AFTER THIS CRISIS I COULD REPRESENT YEAR THE- VESSELS AT ANCHOR THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOING TO BE TRANSITORY NATURE IN OTHER WORDS WE'LL GET BACK TO SOME NORMALCY WILL RETURN WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY THIS IS AN ANCHOR. LPO FIFTY ONE FOR EVERYBODY- SHIPPING THE STATE NO MATTER. WHERE YOU ARE ON THE QUESTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE BUT WAS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY IS THAT TWENTY MILLION NUMBER IT'S GOING TO INCREASE FOR THE REASONS I HAVE BEEN STATED HERE AT THIS COMMITTEE MEETING SO SUFFICE TO SAY THAT I THINK AGAIN. GOING FORWARD IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY CRITICAL- TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE GATE OUR OPERATIONS THE REASON WHY. AND WHY I MADE THAT STATEMENT BACK IN JERRY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE LAST. PERSON TPM PUMP I WAS HERE IN LONG BEACH IT'S- GOOD ONE OF THE LAW. IN THE US. PORT INDUSTRY. ACCOMPLICES HELD ANNUALLY. BUT THE LOSS IN. MEETING WAS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN. ABOUT WE HAD A DENTIST OF SOME OF THESE ISSUE WERE JUST WHAT. AND REYES THIS YEAR THE C. E. O. ONE OF THE INTERNATIONAL. JEREMY NEXT. WAS OUR AT THE BROUGH. OF CON OF THE CARE THIS YEAR. WHY BOTTOM. THERE'S A THERE'S A CALL TO SEE IF AS TO WHY WE HIS SISTER. ONE OF MY OLDER BAY IN TERMS WHAT OCCURRED AFTER THE SPRING OF TWO TWENTY BUT HIS ANSWER. OUR LOOK PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR- ABOUT FIRST. I COMPORTED. IT IS. SO I THINK AGAIN- IT'S NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL WITH JUST ONE FOUR SEVEN FRAMEWORK- GIVES A STATE AS DOES REQUIRED TO SUPPLY CHAIN TO MOVEMENT DIRECTION SO I THINK AGAIN THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT LOVE. WHAT'S ARE KIND ACTION ASSISTED OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS WHAT. THAT WATER MAYBE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF. A NEAR TERM METRICS. AT THE END OF THE DAY IN MY VIEW. IT HER MORTARBOARD ENGINEERS AND- SO WE WON'T GET A SITUATION IT WILL BE A UNDER. EVENT IN THE YEARS TO COME. I DON'T KNOW HISTORY YOU THAT IN SUCH. WE GET IN SCITUATE A LOT OF. WE DO IS WE KNOW THE ANSWER ARE AND WE NEED INSIST. BETTER WHATEVER MAKE IN A FEW. WITH REGARD TO. BOND I THINK MUCH AND I AS A WANT TO THAT LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH MARIO AND EUGENE- AND THE TO ME THOSE INVESTMENTS- INSTANT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SO WE BEGIN TO MORE THIS MARKET SHARE BY. THANK THANK YOU US IS NO FURTHER. THANK YOU TO- FOR YOUR PAGE FIRST- AND YOU AND YOUR INFORMATION. INSURING WITH US TODAY AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY. FOR MORE BUSY THAN EVER. SO AGAIN- ON BEHALF OF THIS COMMITTEE I THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE NEED TO OUR THANK YOU. JAMES ROGAN MARC MARIO CORDERO GOOD GUYS- NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO- GOODS ARE GOOD GOOD MOVEMENT INDUSTRY LEADERS AND HOW THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS. OUR LAST PANEL DISCUSS HOW GOODS MOVEMENT AND OTHER GOODS MOVING INDUSTRY IT LEADERS ARE RESPONDING TO CRISIS AND WHAT ASSISTANCE THEY NEED FROM US THAT ARE STRICTLY THEIR STATE LEADERS. EACH PANELIST WELL FIVE MINUTES IF YOU CAN CUT IT DOWN A BIT THAT MIGHT BE GOOD WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED AS ANOTHER HEARING COMING IN THEY HAVE TO CLEAN THE ROOM BUT I WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU SO PLEASE PROCEED ALREADY WILL START WITH MIKE JACOB. VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T SHARE MEMBERS- I CHECK WITH CANNOT SAY WE REPRESENT OCEAN CARRIERS MY TERMINAL OPERATORS. CAN AND WILL REALLY APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING. US IN THIS- BUT HEARING TODAY AND- JUST GIVEN THE TIME OF PURCHASE WORTH THOUSAND WORDS I HAVE A COUPLE SLIDES TO SHARE- AND I THINK- WHAT WE WE'LL DO IS WE CAN OF GOING THROUGH THE- ALL- THE STAFF TO HAVE THOSE SENT AROUND TO GO NUMBER. AND- IT JUST JUST. CONSIDERING OF YOUR TIME- AND I THINK THE BEST THING SAY IS THAT- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK AND THE PRESENTATION- BY BURKE THE PORT COMMISSION. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT THE FORTY SECOND DIRECTORS- FROM LA LONG BEACH AND OAKLAND. THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM THE COMMENTS TODAY ON A- THIS MICHELIN IN THE STRIKING THE- ENTIRE SYSTEM WORKS FOR THE BENEFIT OF CARGO OWNERS- THEY ARE OUR ULTIMATE CUSTOMERS EVERYONE HERE FROM TODAY THAT'S A KERRIER NOTION HERE REAL CARAMEL- CARRIER. THERE ARE BRAND BUT FOR THEIR. CUSTOMERS- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MOVING GOODS TO THAT'S WHAT WE OBSERVE TO DO- AND- TWO SIX THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT OPTIMALLY- IN EVERY CASE- CERTAINLY THAT IS THAT IS NOT OUR- INTENTION OF NOT WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING. BUT OVERALL THE ENTIRETY OF THE SYSTEM IF YOU LOOK AT LEAST THAT THE LATEST NUMBERS WE PUBLISH OUR WEST COAST TRIP LAST MONTH BUT OUR OVERALL TOTAL THROUGHPUT YOUR TO DATE AT SAN PEDRO BAY- IS UP NEARLY LEVELS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS FACILITATE THOSE CHANGES IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT- EXACT DIRECTOR SOROKA WAS TALKING ABOUT. GIVING GLOBAL DYNAMICS AND IN DEMAND FOR GOODS- AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF THE- THE IMAGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH- ARE WAITING AMY IN OAKLAND. ALSO REALLY TREMENDOUS AND SO BUT- WHY NAME HIM. WHEN YOU COMPARE BACK TO NINETEEN- WAS MOVE- OVER 50% MORE GOODS WHEN YOU COMPARE TO TWENTY NINETEEN CLOSE TO A 100% MORE IN TERMS OF TOTAL WORK. LOADS TURNED THEIR THEIR SYSTEMS ARE JUST TREMENDOUS NUMBERS- BUT WHERE WE SEE THE STRAIN. AND WHERE ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED OUR- ATTENTION AFTER THIS HEARING WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS. IS ON PRODUCING TWELVE TIMES- AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO SKIN THIS CAT LOTS OF APPROACHES THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONTROVERSY OVER SOME OF THOSE INCLUDING THOSE EXCESSIVE DWELL TIME FEES- BUT OUR TOTAL DWELL TIME ON TERMINAL. RECODED ARE WE'RE AVERAING ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN DAYS- AND NOW WE'RE UP BY CLOSE TO SIX DAYS- AND SO WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DOUBLING AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SPACE AND TIME THAT IS USING THE CAPACITY SO. NOT ONLY REMOVING THAT WERE MOVING ON AVERAGE SITS LONGER BOTH OF THOSE THINGS COMPOUND THEY TAKE MORE TIME AWAY FROM OUR ABILITY TO MOVE THE CLOCK THE SYSTEM AS WE HEARD. I WITH RESPECT TO- THOSE CONTAINERS MULLIN WAS SIGNIFICANT WHILE TIME. OR IN FIVE DAYS YOUR AVERAGE OF THOSE CONTAINERS PRETTY COVE IT WAS ABOUT 6% OF THE CONTAINER SOPHOMORE IN FIVE DAYS. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN TERMINAL. ARE TAKING OVER FIVE DAYS TO MOVE AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND THEN LASTLY BEFORE I TURN IT BACK OVER AND WE HEAR FROM. OUR PARTNERS IN LABOR MISTER POSITIVELY ON TALKING ABOUT THE EFFORTS ARE W. IS MAKING TO MOVE THAT POSITIONAL CARGO THAT ADDITIONAL THIRTY PERCENT. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE- EXPORTING JEEZ QUESTION- AND OBVIOUSLY THE- IMPORTANCE OF EMPTIES BEING LOADED VERSUS- BUT- EXPERTS. BEING LOADED HER ZACKS WAS BEING- EMPTY ARE DIFFERENT FOR NORTHERN CAL. SOME CAL. DRAMATICALLY AND WE NEED- WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH OUR PART IN THAT IN THIS TO MAKE THAT WE ARE FACILITATING A MUCH MORE. BACKS CARGO POSS. BUT WE ALL HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE SHOW TERM. WITH RESPECT TO- AND IN TWO. OUT OF SUFFOLK. BECAUSE THEIR CALL ARE SAID. AND I JUST APPOINT THAT IN SAN PEDRO BAY- OUR RECORDS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN MOVING UP AND UP AND UP BUT EXPORTED DISS PERCENTAGE. BUT SO FAR YEAR TO DATE- THROUGH SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE EXPORTED TESE WERE ALREADY HIGHER THAN THEY'VE BEEN AT ANY OTHER POINT IN TIME- AND IF WE- PROJECT THOSE FURTHER THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR WILL BE OVER SEVEN MILLION- T. ISN'T EMPTY SO. WE'RE MOVING MORE SHIPS THAN EVER WE HAVE MORE MINOR SERVICING NUMBER SHIP SIZES GOING DOWN BUT WE ARE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO. ROUTE EVERYTHING SHIP LOADED- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME- AND I APPRECIATE THE- COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER JACOB WILL MOVE ON TO. REMOTE PONCE DALY. HE IS A PRESS I'LL THIRD- MISSED POSITIVELY ON YOU MAY FOR ON RIGHT. YOU'RE ON THE PHONE ON THE PHONE. YOU HEAR ME. ALWAYS SHE LIVES. RIGHT THANK- THANK YOU- JOE DONNELLY AND COACH OF GETS YEAH- IT'S HORRIBLE THING YOU FOR US TO BE UP OF THE SO. ALL ON STATE SEPT ON UP AT PORTS IN MOVED- BEFORE I GO ANY. ONE OF THE THINGS A RED FOR WE HAVE TO CARE OF IN JUST THAT'S SOME I MEAN THEY GOT TO BE IN FOEMOST- THAT'S IMPORTANT NEED TO HAVE SOME SHIPS TO CALL OAKLAND AND TO HELP THEM WITH THE EXPORTS. BOB ALL I COULD THINK THE OUTDOOR. THEY AYE ALTHOUGH USED THAT WOULD THE PARTS OF ALONG BEACH THE CASF WORK FOR. AND THE POOR TRUCK UP WHO ARE COLLECTED BLOKE RECORDS A STATE BEFORE. TRY TO GO TO THIS BRIEF. YEAH WE WORK TO CALL WE HAVE. SIX PRO WORK AMIDST TWENTY DEATHS WE'VE HAD. A STUDENTS CALLED- AND- NEVER THE HISTORY HAVE HAVE WE- RECORDS IN HAS LAID OUT WELL SIMPLE. UP WHAT IS. SB UNDER. IS HAVE OVER HALF A CENTURY MAYBE LONGER OF A- THAT ALLOWS FOR THREE D. SHIP BY CHEF SECONDS AND THIRD SHIFT SO WHEN THEY US WE WERE PURCHASE STATE SOME CONTRACT- YEAH TO HAVE THE ORDER IT. OKAY AND WHAT'S THE EMPLOYERS ARE FOR A OUT OF. I WE DO HAVE TO DIFFERENT STARTS ON THE FIRST STARTED OUT SO- DIFFERENT TIMES STARTS THE SECOND SHIFT START AT. FOUR AND IN THE- THIRD SHIFT IS UP TO IBM INTO. SO WE REALLY HAVEN'T MAYBE A DOWNTURN UP FOR HOURS. SO IN THE THIRD SHIFT WE COULD PROBABLY SOME KIND. SOME RARE WORK IT'S DELIVER. AND THAT WOULD BE CALLED- CHECK. NOW I WANT TO GET INTO ISSUE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. THAT THAT WE NEED TO BE PATIENT OUT THERE AND WE DO. FEEL THAT THE TRUCK OPERATOR HAVING TO SIT THE LINE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WHEN WE TAKE OUT CARGO FROM THE BAY. AND DELIVERED TO A TRUCK- WE MIGHT HAVE TO GET TO THE SIX. ROLLBACK BOB CAN HAVE TO DIG CANS OUT GET TO THE CONTAINER DELIVER IT BUT THE CANS BACK. AND THEN THIS PROCESS CONTINUES AND AS IT EMPTIES OUT IT'S QUICKER. BUT WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THESE CONGESTION THE SHIP COMES BEHIND US. AND THAT UNIT PUTS THE COMPUTERS BACK TO FULL CAPACITY SO WERE CRACKED. OKAY SO. KNOWING THAT- THAT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. NOW THERE'S THREE SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAD AND MOST OF ITS READY TALK TALK ABOUT. THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION IS BEING WORKED ON WITH THAT. WHAT THE CURRENT WITH UP. ON VIæT. UP ENVOY AT JUMBLE CARI AND- IS. TASK FORCE. JEFF AND UP TO PORT. YOUR ALONG WITH OUR- ACOSTA INTERFACE PASSED ALONG TO ME WITH THEM TO NEED TO DAYS A- SO THERE. ON CONTINUAL- THEY DID TALK ABOUT. THE SOLUTION ABOUT HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE SO I WILL GET INTO THAT. AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH PORT COMMISSIONERS. A MARIO CORDERO AND ANGIE SOROKA FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. AND TAKING ON THE TASK AND- AND PUTTING THAT THE CARRIERS TO TASK A LITTLE BIT SINCE THEY'VE GONE. AND RECORDED PUBLICLY POINT FIVE BILLION IN PROFITS. THAT DOESN'T COME BACK INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NOR INTO OUR ECONOMY. SO THAT WAS A PLUS. AND THAT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T STINK THEIR AMERICAN. SUMER AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHY SAID THE AGRICULTURE. WE NEED TO HAVE- THAT SOULS- TO EXPORT OUR- AT UP THERE IN THEN SAVE OUR OUR FORMER INDUSTRY. AND THE MID TERMSOLUTION- JUST. SB COSCO'S- WAREHOUSE SLASH RETAIL STORE. THE CONTAINER IS WAREHOUSE. SO WE ARE. TOLD MAKES WITH NEW CAR. ON THE FIRST. REPORTS THIS TERM IS TO GET SOME GLASS. AND TO MOVE THIS CAR WILL HOW THAT HAPPENS IS THE- US. WE CONTAINABLE. WE'VE ALREADY PRO WE CAN THAT FAST AND IF. AND YOU KEEP THE STAFF. AS A GROUP FACILITY THAN AS THIS. OR IN. OF MOVING CAR. OKAY NOW IF YOU TALK ABOUT IT. AUTONOMY THAT IS WE GET BECAUSE THAT IS. ON TRY DELIVER WE AFFORD A TRY. ARE WE NEED TO MOVE TO RAILS. SO WE CAN GET THE- FIVE MILLION KEYS- MILLION TEENS. THAT HELLO BE THE GATEWAY. WE CAN GO FORTY. TO PER. ON DOT RAIL LAW TERM IS THIS A LOW. WE CAN LOAD UP ON DOCK RAIL THREE HUNDRED MOVES WITH TWO UNITS FIVE. IT'S ON THE RAIL WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS THAT A RAIL. BUT IT TO A DISTRIBUTION CENTER CLOSE TO WHETHER FULFILLMENT AND DISTRIBUTION AREAS ARE OFFLOADED THERE BUT THE CAR WAS THERE. WE NEED TO BE TRUE BUT- IF YOU GO TO AUTOMATION IS ACTUALLY FOR DENSITY DENSITIES EIGHT NINE NINE IMAGINE TAKING. NINE I FOR THEM THE DAILY TO ALTER. ALONG WITH LINES BE. WE WILL THE CAR GO FASTER WE THE POST IN THE- DIALED. AS SECOND TO NONE WE WILL CAR THAT'S WHY IT'S HERE IT'S ON THE BALLOT. WE ARE GATEWAY. CONTINUE TO MAKE WHAT NEED WE NEED TO DO. IN OUR CONTRACT DR THE LAST I WANT TO SAY CHAD. THEY AND I AT THE WORKING TOGETHER. CLOSELY WITH EXTRA. FREIGHT OPERATORS FROM DELIVERY PURPOSE ONLY TO HER FIFTH WITHIN A NINETY DAYS WE'VE ALREADY HAPPENED TO A SYSTEM AND NOW WORKED WITH CONTINUED. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT MORE IDEAS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS CARGO. MAKE ANY PATIENT WE ARE THE LABOR FORCE AND IF YOU DO NOT AS WELL MAKING. IT JUST AS WE NEED TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ON RAMON PASEO- FOR YOUR PASSION FIRST OF ALL YES- YOUR EDUCATION ALSO I YOU HIGHLIGHTED ANOTHER RICOTTA. BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH MANAGEMENT HERE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM TO AND TAKE CARE OF THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE PORT. SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT WE'RE NEXT GOING TO GO ON TO A ONE ACOSTA. REGIONAL VICE REGIONAL ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT FROM BEING US UP THAT'S THE REAL WAY- ONE ACOSTA. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND- CHAIRMAN GONZALEZ APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH OTHER COMMITTEE TODAY. ABOUT BNSF'S PERFORMANCE- DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME I'VE BEEN WITH THE ROAD NOW TWENTY ONE YEARS SO THIS IS THE- UNUSUAL OF TO SAY THE LEAST- WHAT IS BEEN SAID ABOUT. HOW WE GOT HERE- THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE PANDEMIC EXPOSED A WEAKNESS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN OR THE SUPPLY CHAIN WAS ALREADY SHOWING THAT WEAKNESS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- BUT I THINK THE LOW DWELL TIME TWO DAYS AND RAILYARDS STUFF VERY FEW SHIPS AT ANCHOR. AT THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH SUGGESTS THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN WASN'T BROKEN WHAT WE'VE DONE THOUGH- THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND POST PENDENTIVES YOU KNOW AFTER SHUTTING OFF. THE GLOBAL COMMERCE ENGINE WE ARE WE BOTH AT THE MANUFACTURING COMPONENT OF SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL AS THE DELIVERY COMPONENT I WE'VE REPLACED THAT OLD MACHINE WHICH HAS BEEN SIXTY YEARS IN THE MAKING IT STARTED BACK IN THE MID FIFTIES WITH MALCOLM MACLEAN'S INNOVATION. OF THE SEABORNE CONTAINER AND IT'S GROWN SINCE THEN BUT WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE NOW RETOOLING OR REBUILDING THAT MACHINE ON THE FLY AND IS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CONSUMER EXPENDITURES YOU KNOW MORE GOODS AND SERVICES MORE ONLINE THAN IN STORE- AND WE ALSO SAW IN THE EARLY PORTION THE PANDEMIC. INVENTORIES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE INVENTORIES NATIONALLY AMONG RETAILERS READ ON ONE MONTH LEFT. SO VERY LOW INVENTORIES AND THEN THERE WAS THE BIG PUSH THE BIG PUSH TO RESTOCK AND TO PURCHASE AHEAD OF- THE CHRISTMAS SEASON AND TO ANTICIPATE A MANUFACTURING- SHORTFALL SO- WE WENT FROM A JUST IN TIME DELIVERY SYSTEM. TO ADJUSTING CASE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN IN VOLUMES THAT YOU SEE AT THE PORT SENATE THE RAILYARDS- THROUGH AUGUST OF TWENTY ONE BNSF MOVED MORE CONTAINERS- THROUGH OUR- INTERMODAL YARDS AT THE SAME POINT. IN THAT THE SAME POINT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS THE PREVIOUS RECORD YEAR. BOB SO WHEN YOU WON'T LET'S TALK ABOUT RAIL INTERMODAL. THEY THEY ARE ALL A THROUGH- VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MR CONSTANTLY ON SAID ABOUT THE PORTS WE ARE ALL ABOUT THROUGHPUT WE ARE NOT DESIGNED OR BUILT. FOR LONG ERM STORAGE- SO IF THE ENGAGED EXCEEDS ADVOCATING OF CONTAINERS. OF THE RESULT IS CONGESTION AND THE MORE CONGESTION YOU HAVE- THE MORE THAT CONGESTION AND BACKS UP IN THE MAIN LINES OF CURRENTLY AT ANY GIVEN POINT- DURING THIS WEEK WE WILL HAVE THIRTY TRAINS. WAITING TO ENTER WAITING TO UNLOAD AT DIFFERENT INTERMODAL YARDS- AROUND THE COUNTRY- SO IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED CONTAINERS ON ON ANY GIVEN DAY- AND THAT. OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO WORSEN THE SITUATION THEY WERE FACED WITH CONTAINERS AND CHASSIS. SO WHILE WE'RE ON PACE FOR A RECORD VOLUMES- INTERNATIONAL CONTAINERS DWELT IN OUR YARDS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN UNLOADED 30% MORE THAN THEY DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- SO. THE MORPH WE HAVE COMING IN- THE LESS AND IT'S PICKED UP YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE GOT THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE FORMULA- NOW GENERALLY SPEAKING FROM END TO END THERE IS ENOUGH CAPACITY. IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN- BUT ONLY IF. THERE'S TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATIONS AND ONLY IF EACH COMPONENT OF THE PIPELINE WORKS NOW I SAY THIS WITH ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION AND THAT IS THE ONLY BASE. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND YOU'VE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WAREHOUSING SAME IS TRUE OF RAIL CAPACITY WE WE'D LOVE TO MOVE MORE ON DOCK RAIL ON THE RAILROAD BUT YOU HAVE TO LAND THAT FREIGHT SOMEPLACE. IN CALIFORNIA EITHER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THANK- ALL. UP IN UP IN THE HIGH DESERT- YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE FACILITIES THAT CAN HANDLE ON DOCK RAIL SO YOU'VE GOT BLOCKS WHAT FACILITIES PERHAPS IN PLACES LIKE BARSTOW HIGH DESERT. ON THE ON THE BE IN A SENTENCE- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S A NEW SOME ADMINISTRATIONS PARTNERSHIP WITH- THE U. S. D. O. T. ON BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK BOB HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL BUT I BUT MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF. OF THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE INABILITY TO BUILD ANYTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S A STATE PROJECT THAT WE WERE GOING TO. BUILD WITH THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AS A PARTNERI STARTED WORKING ON A PROJECT WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS IN DIAPERS SHE IS A TWENTY YEAR OLD SOPHOMORE THIS YEAR IN COLLEGE. WE STILL HAVEN'T BUILT IT WE IT TOOK US UP ALMOST- TEN YEARS TO GET A PERMIT WE GOT A PERMIT FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE WERE SUED AND- WE ULTIMATELY. PREVAILED ON APPEAL BUT WE'RE BACK TO. BOXES ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER FOR PICK UP AND THE CUSTOMER IS NOTIFIED SO- TYPICALLY DEPENDING ON THE FACILITY HAVE ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF FREE TIME- BEFORE AY STORAGE FEES ACCRUE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADD ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TO THAT DEPENDING ON WHEN THE CUSTOMERS NOTIFIED BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY DON'T START THE CLOCK UNTIL. ONE DAY AFTER THE CUSTOMER'S BEEN NOTIFIED SO DO YOU YOU COULD HAVE ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO REALLY THREE DAYS OF STORAGE OF FREE TIME STORAGE. WE ON THE ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THE STORAGE FEE WE PROVIDE CREDITS WE ALLOW OR- AWARD- CUSTOMERS CREDIT SICKENING CREDITS FOR BOXES THAT ARE OUTDATED. ON ON A HOLIDAY OR ON THE WEEKEND WE DONE THAT NOT ONLY AT THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH WE'VE DONE IT. EITHER ANOTHER FACILITIES IN THEM LIKE THE- THE MAJOR FACILITY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHICAGO L. P. C. O. I THINK GOD'S BEAUTY MYERS MENTION THAT WE OFFER A FIFTY DOLLAR BOX. CREDIT FOR CUSTOMERS AS WELL WHO DELIVER BOXES OR PICK UP BOXES ON THE WEEKEND- A MAJOR COMPONENT OF WHAT WE DO WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IS- VISIBILITY INTO THEIR FREIGHT VISIBILITY INTO OUR OPERATIONS SO PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH THAT INFORMATION IS. IS CRITICAL WHEN WHAT'S KEY HERE IS REAL TIME COMMUNICATION REAL TIME INFORMATION SO WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES IT'S SIMPLY AN APPLICATION IT BUT IT'S AN APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN EITHER PUSH NOTIFICATIONS OR TO PULL INFORMATION FROM OUR SYSTEM. AS THEY WISH AS THEY WAT CONCERNING OF THE TRAIN ARRIVALS DEPARTURES ON A REAL TIME BASIS THE STATUS OF THEIR FREIGHT- PRICING- WAYBILL INFORMATION- THIS THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DO ANALYTICS ALLOWS THEM TO MANAGE THEIR SERVICE THEIR THEIR OPERATIONS THEIR PICKUPS- IN IN A WAY THAT- I THINK WILL HELP- NOT ONLY IN THIS. SITUATION BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY'S INFORMATION SHARING ARM WOULD DO A LOT OF INNOVATION NOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD TO BE VERY RESOURCEFUL SO FOR EXAMPLE AT OUR BIG CHICAGO FACILITY THE LPC- WE'VE WE'VE CREATED MORE STORAGE CAPACITY. WE TOOK. TO EIGHT THOUSAND FOOT- TRACKS. TOOK THEM OUT OF OUT OF SERVICE IN THE YARD AND WE LAID THE HOUND SPECIALLY MANUFACTURED MATS OVER THE TRACKS TO ALLOW FOR STACKING AND D. RAMPING CUSTOMER BOXES NOW. THAT'S INCREASED THE STORAGE CAPACITY THAT YOU ARE BY ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF TEN TRAINS TEN INTERMODAL TRAINS BUT THAT COMES AT A COST AND ONLY THE EXPENSE OF. MANUFACTURING AND INSTALLING THOSE SPECIALIZED MATS BUT IT REDUCES YOUR PRODUCTION SO YOU KNOW WHICH IT IS A SHORT TERM BANDAID SOLUTION- TO CREATE MORE STORAGE CAPACITY- BNSF HAS ESTABLISHED SEVERAL IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OFFSITE TRADES PROGRAMS. IN TEXAS KANSAS CITY MEMPHIS- THE BACKEND OF THESE CONTAINER MOVES OUT OF CALIFORNIA- WE ACTUALLY PAY OUR OWN IN OUR OWN POCKET. THIS IS AT OUR EXPENSE WE DRAPED ALONG THE WELLING CONTAINERS TO OFF SITE LOTS- WE'VE OPENED A NEW INTERMODAL TERMINAL IN MEMPHIS JUST IN RESPONSE TO THE PRESSURES AND RELIEF PRESSURES- IN PLACES LIKE CHICAGO AND THE- THE DALLAS FORT WORTH ALLIANCE- INTERMODAL FACILITIES. SO ALL THESE BACK IN CHALLENGES THAT THE WILL ROADS- HAVE TO FACE AN- ARC ARE DRIVEN BY FRONT AND DECISIONS AND NEVER REALLY INCLUDES. THE CONTINUING ORDER OF FREIGHT SHIPMENTS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO MOVE THE CONTAINERS BEYOND THE RAILYARDS THAT'S GETTING BACK TO THE TO THE PHRASE I USED BEFORE WE MOVE FROM JUST IN TIME DELIVERY TOO JUST. IN CASE A LIVERY- SO WE WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER SUGGEST HERE I THINK A PRACTICAL ONE- BUT WHY NOT A JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER WITH YOU KNOW THE SUMMIT APPROACHES IS USEFUL TO ERRING OUT LARGE. HAVING LARGE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BIG ISSUES BUT BUT ON A DAY TO DAY BLOCKING AND TACKLING- ASPECT OF THIS OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM A JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER- MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE WITH SOMETHING THAT THE RAILROAD USE IN CHICAGO. WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE POLAR VORTEX WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW- CRIPPLING WEATHER AND- GET EACH OF THE STAKEHOLDERS OR THE RAILROADS IN THAT CASE IN CHICAGO BUT EACH OF THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE SAME OPERATIONS CENTER SO THEY CAN HAVE GREATER VISIBILITY. EASIER COMMUNICATION FACILITATE RESPONSES TO PROBLEMS AS AS THEY COME UP AND THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING WE DO ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN. HERE IN FORT WORTH WE HAVEN'T- NETWORK OPERATIONS CENTER WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNION PACIFIC WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM AMTRAK- WE HAVE THE MARKETING FOLKS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE DISPATCHING. OF PERSONNEL AND IN THAT IT DOES HELP COMMUNICATIONS THAT DOES HELP WITH PROBLEM SOLVING ON A ON A REAL TIME BASIS- I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO. THINGS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT HERE ONE IS OF THE DOMESTIC CONTAINERS IN THE GREATER UTILIZATION OF DOMESTIC CONTAINERS- WELL. THESE THE INTERNATIONAL CONTAINERS CAN BE TRADE TO- A LOCAL FACILITY WHERE THERE OTHERS TRANSLOAD INTO DOMESTIC CONTAINERS LARGER CONTAINERS FORTY EIGHT FIFTY THREE FOOT MORE SAYING. THE USE OF DOMESTIC CONTAINERS INCREASE- THAT FREES UP INTERNATIONAL CONTAINERS QUICKLY AND ALLOWS THEM TO GET BACK TO ASIA- BUT BUT- BUT LASTLY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- WE'RE GONNA SEE ANALYZE. TO SEE IS- CONSUMERS. DRIVING THE SOLUTION IN A SENSE- RECENT SURVEYS SAY THAT 80% OF CONSUMERS FOR GIFT CARDS OVER PHYSICAL GIFTS THIS YEAR. 25% OF THOSE FOLKS- SITE PROBLEMS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE'RE WE'RE FOR THAT PREFERENCE. DAHLE LEAVE YOU WITH THAT. THANK YOU SIR I WILL THAT WILL GO TO CHRISTIAN MOTOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION MR SHIMON. THANK YOU CHAIRED ON ALL MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CHRISTIAN MOTOR WITH CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND I DO HAVE SOME SLIDES. WE NEED FOR THOSE THE GO UP. RIGHT SECOND SLIDE PLEASE. K. TO GET AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF CONGESTION AT THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH IT'S HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE LIFE CYCLE OF HOW THINGS WORK UNDER NORMAL NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE CONTAINERS JEFF DISCHARGE FROM THE STEAM SHIP ONTO A MARINE TERMINAL THE CARGO OWNERS NOTIFIED THAT THE CONTAINERS AVAILABLE THE CARD OWNER ONLY HAS SO MANY DAYS TO RETRIEVE OR BE READY TO RECEIVE A CONTAINER BEFORE A LATE FEE CALLED THE MERGE IS ASSESSED. A TRUCKER EITHER CONTRACTED WITH THE STEAMSHIP LINE OR BY THE CARGO OWNER ENTERS THE MARINE TERMINAL TO PICK UP THE CONTAINER WE SEE ON THAT PICTURE RIGHT THERE IS A- CONTAINER BEING DROPPED ONTO A CRITICAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CALLED THE CHASSIS THESE ARE REQUIRED TO MOVE THE CONTAINER BECAUSE SHIPPING CONTAINERS DO NOT HAVE WHEELS THEMSELVES FOR LAND TRANSPORT. THE TRUCKER TRANSPORTS THE CONTAINER ON THE CHASSIS TO THE CARGO OWNER FACILITY CONTAINERS UNLOADED AND RETURNED TO EITHER THE MARINE TERMINAL OR AN OFF DOCK CONTAINER CONTAINER TERMINATION POINT AS DIRECTED BY THE CONTAINER PROVIDER THE EMPTY CONTAINER MUST BE RETURNED IN A SET NUMBER OF DAYS OR A LATE FEE CALLED THE TENSION OR PER DIEM IS ASSESSED TO THE CARGO OWNER. IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PROCESS INCLUDING THE FEES ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE FLUIDITY OF CONTAINER MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT INTERRUPTED THIS FLUIDITY- AS DIRECTOR SOROKIN MISTER JACOBS DID POINT OUT THE PORTS ARE MOVING MORE EMPLOYEES THAN EVER THAT IS TRUE BUT ALSO TAKING IN MORE IMPORTS THAN EVER. DATA FROM THE PORTS INDICATE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND MORE NET IMPORTS ARRIVED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR VERSUS LAST YEAR. THIS HIGHER THAN TYPICAL DEMAND FOR IMPORTS HAS RESULTED IN AN ACCESS OF EMPTY CONTAINERS IN AND AROUND THE PORTS. AS IMPORTS ARE BROUGHT IN AT A FASTER RATE THAN EMPTY CONTAINERS OR OR LOADED EXPORTS FOR THAT MATTER EVACUATED. I NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS CRUSH OF EMPTY CONTAINERS DECIDED BY OUR MEMBERSHIP AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE PREVENTING FLUIDITY OF CONTAINER MOVEMENTS IN THE PORT COMPLEX. MARINE TERMINALS ARE CONGESTED TO THE POINT THAT MANY CANNOT ACCEPT EMPTY CONTAINERS FROM TRUCKERS. THESE CONTAINERS ARE BACKING UP A TRUCKER- TRUCKING FACILITIES AND TYING UP CRITICAL CHASSIS IS. WITHOUT CHASSIS IS NEITHER IMPORT OR EXPORT CONTAINERS CAN MOVE BY LAND. A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND HARBOR TRUCKING ASSOCIATION OF JUST FIFTY TRUCKING COMPANIES. SERVICING THE PORTS FOUND THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE HOLDING AN ESTIMATED NINE THOUSAND EMPTY CONTAINERS. 79% OF WHICH ARE SITTING ON CHASTITY'S. WHILE THE SURVEY COVERED LESS THAN 6% OF THE TRUCKING COMPANIES AUTHORIZED TO OPERATE AT THE PORTS. CHASSIS IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 13% OF THE PORT'S LARGEST CHASSIS POOLS. ARE SITTING UNDER EMPTY CONTAINERS AT THEIR YARDS. THERE ARE LIKELY THOUSANDS OF OTHER CHASSIS STOCK OTHER AND UNDER EMPTIES. THESE EMPTY CONTAINER STILL ACCRUE LATE CHARGES WHICH AS MR ISOM NOTED HENCE PRESENTATION CAN BE EXORBITANT. DESPITE BEING STRANDED OUTSIDE THE MARINE TERMINALS UNABLE TO BE RETURNED FURTHER INFLATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS ALSO HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON TERMINAL PRODUCTIVITY THIS IS A SCREEN GRAB FROM THE WEBSITE OF THE MARINE TERMINAL OPERATOR. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING EMPTY CONTAINERS FROM NAME MAJORITY OF EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE TERMINAL IS ALREADY CONGESTED AND THEY NEED SPACE TO UNLOAD SHIPS. THERE ARE ALSO CRITICALLY LOW ON CHASSIS IS WHICH MEANS THE TERMINAL CANNOT BE CLEARED OF IMPORTS. THE MORE CHANCES CANNOT BE FREED UP UNTIL EMPTY CONTAINERS ARE ACCEPTED BY TERMINALS- OFF DOCK TERMINATION POINTS. THIS DYNAMIC HAS CREATED A NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP THAT IS WORSENING CONGESTION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN THE NEAR TERM THE FASTEST SOLUTION TO FIXING THE SITUATION IS FOR EMPTY CONTAINERS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PORTS BY WHAT'S CALLED SWEEPER VESSELS AND THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES- THERE OF TIMES WHERE THIS IS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST TO CLEAR. AYE CONGESTED MARINE GATEWAYS THIS IS TYPICAL PRACTICE ONE MARINE TERMINALS EXPERIENCE GRIDLOCK- I'M ALSO HEARING FROM MEMBERS TYPICAL- AFTER PEAK SEASON. WE ENCOURAGE POLICY MAKERS AT ALL LEVELS TO CALL ON STEAMSHIP LINES TO BRING SWEEPER VESSELS TO CLEAR INTO CONTAINERS. I'M IN THE MID TERM ALSO FOR THE GOVERNOR'S SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTIVE ORDER STATE AND LOCAL LAND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE PORT SHOULD BE USED FOR EMPTY CONTAINER TERMINATION POINTS. WERE CONTAINERS CAN BE REMOVED FROM CHASTITY'S AND THE CLOCK ON LATE FEES CAN STOP. THIS WILL REDUCE COSTS IMPACTS FROM PORT GRIDLOCK AND RESTORE FLUIDITY TO INLAND CONTAINER MOVEMENT BY FREEING UP CRITICAL CHASTITY'S. ONCE EMPTY CONTAINERS ARE EVACUATED IN CHASSIS AVAILABILITY IS RESTORED THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A REASONABLE FEDERAL HOURS OF SERVICE FLEXIBILITY. TO ENSURE THAT AVAILABLE GATE HOURS CAN BE UTILIZED- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND TO CLOSE I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE EMPTY CONTAINER ISSUE MUST BE ADDRESSED TO RESTORE THE FLOW OF GOODS AT THE PORT. AND THIS IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR OUR OUR FOLKS WHO CARE ABOUT EXPORTS WITHOUT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GATEWAYS BEING CLEARED THE NORMAL VESSEL CALLS ARE NOT GOING TO RESUME- BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE LARGER ISSUE THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID. A COUPLE TIMES- BY WITNESSES THAT- THIS IS REALLY YOU KNOW THE POOR CONGESTION A SYMPTOM OF A LARGER GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. NEARLY EVERY MENU FOR IN NEARLY EVERY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT IS EXPERIENCING COST INCREASES PART SHORTAGES AND DELAYS. FOR INSTANCE DUE TO A GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF MICROPROCESSORS TRUCK MANUFACTURERS HAVE STOPPED TAKING ORDERS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. HAVE GIVEN LITTLE INDICATION AS TO WHEN PRODUCTION WILL RETURN TO NORMAL. THIS WILL MAKE MEETING NEAR TERM REGULATORY DEADLINES FULLY INTEND TO COMPLY. AND ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THESE ISSUES WILL PERSIST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS A SUPPLY CHAIN STRUGGLED TO RIGHT THEMSELVES. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY TO ENSURE MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO THE SECTOR THAT SUPPORTS A THIRD OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND JOBS. AND MAKE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL FREIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SCHROEDER VERY VERY WELL DONE- AND BROUGHT IT DOWN TO KIND OF A LEVEL WHERE WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT TOO SO THANK YOU- WITHOUT WILL NEXT TURN TO RUN HER DIRECTOR OF THE TEAMSTERS PORT. DIVISION I BELIEVE MR HER AS ON THE PHONE TODAY. YES I AM A SENTIMENT. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU- START OUT BY THANKING SENATOR GONZALEZ IN YOURSELF A SENTIMENTAL DONALD THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. AND TO ALL THE LEGISLATORS SCALING ATTENDANCE AND WATCHING MY NAME IS RON OR ERIN. AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE PORTS DIVISION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS. THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF CARGO AT THE PORTS IS COMPLICATED AND MADE WORSE BY MANY COMPLEX DYNAMICS AND SYSTEM FAILURES HOWEVER THE CHANGES FEEL THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CURRENT CRISIS HAS BEEN DECADES IN THE MAKING. THE SYSTEMIC MISCLASSIFIED CASE IN COURT DRIVERS HAS CREATED A RENEWED A CHAOTIC UNCOORDINATED AND GOVERNABLE WILD WEST OF THE PORT'S. BUSINESS CLASSIFICATION FOR TERRORISTS IS NOT JUST A LABOR ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE EXPLOITATION OF IMMIGRANT DRIVERS. BY MAJOR CORPORATIONS- SHIFT THE ENTIRE CROSSING DURING BUSINESS CONTENT DOWN WHILE PAYING THEM MINIMUM SUB MINIMUM WAGES AND THE LABOUR LEADER. SITE EVERY DAY AGAINST THIS KIND OF EXPLOITATION OF ASCENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE INTEGRAL TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. A NEGATIVE CONCEPT CONSEQUENCES OF MIS CLASSIFICATION EXTEND BEYOND THE DRIVERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET MISS CLASSIFICATION IS AT THE CORE OF OUR CURRENT QUESTIONS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER TWELVE HUNDRED TRUCKING COMPANIES REGISTERED TO MOVE GOOD AT THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH IN OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND TRUCKS IN SERVICE AT OUR PORTS THE OVERWHELMING. MAJORITY OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO DRIVE THOSE TRUCKS ARE MISCLASSIFIED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS DESPITE THE FACT THAT COMPANIES EXERT OVERWHELMING CONTROL OVER MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS THERE AREN'T ABLE TO MAINTAIN A STABLE WORKFORCE OR KEEP KEEP A GLOBAL. RUNNING SMOOTHLY. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS CONGESTION AT THE PORTS IS TO ADOPT A SYSTEM OF DIRECT EMPLOYEE DRIVERS INSTEAD OF SHIFTING CROSSING THE PAD WHICH TRACKING COMPANIES CAN OPERATE FLEETS IN GENERAL ADMISSION VEHICLES. THAT THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUY I. AND MAINTAIN. MEETING AND STANDARDS AFTER IRISH WOULD BE WILD. FAIRLY COMMON. AND HAVE PAID OFF. SO THEY COULD HAVE- THE WORK EIGHT BIG WORK IN NOT BEING SO. TRUCKING COMPANY COULD USE. TO EFFICIENTLY SCHEDULE AND DEPLOY COOLEY OF TRUCKS TWENTY SEN. IF NECESSARY TO ENJOY THE BACK. MAKE MONEY WHAT WE'RE THEIR VITAL. ARE AND SEND DRIVERS TO BE A OF THE COMPANIES WOULD BE HE TO SO IN DEMAND. CORDED MINI SPENDING IS GOING COORDINATE TRUCKING CAR IN THE IN ENSURE TRACKING COMP- ABLE TO THE- TO AND DRIVERS NEEDED TO GUARANTEE. APPOINTMENT ARE NOT THE SYSTEM WHAT DID PRETTY CHAU OF TRUCK DRIVERS BECAUSE DRIVERS WILL BE THEIR LIVES WAGE AND BENEFITS AND IT WOULD MEAN THE HUGE. OF ENTRY WHICH THE CAR OF BUYING IN MAINE. OUR. THANKS A LOT. AMERICAN THIS FOR IN ACTION JOHN SO BEEN FOUND TO BE IN BECAUSE HE'S- EVERY SEVEN POINT FIVE SIX THE CREATION OF AMONG AGENCY STRIVE FORCE IN CORDIAL. WE GOT THIS I'M- TO ENSURE CAN SCHEMES DRIVERS CHANGE THE SPONSOR TO BE THIS YEAR TO CHANGE THE BUSINESS MY IN THIS WHICH AT THE- BOTH S. B. EIGHT AND A BEATLES. NINETY FOUR. WE TO JOSH. DR SHORTAGE LIKELY GOOD JOBS THAT OFFER A OUT OF. DID THOSE NEIGHBORING COME OR SUFFERED THE MOST PORT POLICE. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD FIND MORE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PROGRAM FOR PORT TRUCK DRIVERS THAT ENSURES. RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES HELLO SUPPLY OF TRAIN DRIVERS WITH INCENTIVES FOR LOCAL HIGHER ONCE WE OF THE JESENICE CLASSIFICATION REPORTS AND IMPLEMENT THE LATEST MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO ENSURE EFFICIENCY YOU PS ALREADY USE IT IT USES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY COURSE CENTRALIZED ELECTRONIC DISPATCH WHICH IS MADE THEM A LEADER IN LOGISTICS THE ONLY OBSTACLE FOR THE PORTS IN ADOPTING A SIMILAR SYSTEM IS A FAILURE OF TRUCKING COMPANIES TO FOLLOW THE LAW. AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE DRIVERS ONCE WE WERE MEETING BOB WE SHOULD ADOPT A SIMILAR DISPATCHES THEM TO RELIEVE CONGESTION THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER RAY AND I KNOW THERE BE A FEW WHICH PROBABLY READ PRETTY. EXPERT OF RECORD THANK YOU TO THAT PANEL FOR FIRMING PAY AND WAIT WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS HEARING- SO LONG COUPLE HOURS LATER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT AGAIN THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR THIS LAST PANEL- MISTER BRADFORD. YES THANK YOU SECURE I HAD A QUESTION FOR MR JACOB- IT'S NO. SECRET THAT MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS HAVE MADE OFF ALL TIME PROFITS OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND DURING THE SAME PERIOD- ARE INDIVIDUAL CONTAINER COSTS HAVE RISEN. AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON AVERAGE. THESE INCREASES HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. YOUR MEMBERS ARE CHARGING MORE TO SHIP- CONTAINERS AND MAKING GREATER PROFITS. WHAT ADDED VALUE OUR- THE- POINT GETTING OR OR JUST LITERALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A BAD SITUATION. THANK YOU SENATOR- CERTAINLY NOT THE LATTER THE- MARKET PLACE OBVIOUSLY DRIVES. WHAT FOLKS WERE CHARGING IT ALSO DRIVES THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE SEND THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM IS OVERWHELMED WITH DEMAND- AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE SEEING SHIPS OFF SHORE HERE. IT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER IS NOT UNIQUE WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY SHIPS WAITING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF SHANGHAI AND NINGBO AS WELL TRYING TO GET IN THAT LINE- SO WE HAVE A CAPACITY SHORTAGE. AND WE ARE MOVING WARSHIPS AND I'LL BRING MORE SHIPS IN THE SERVICE- SO YES THERE IS THE RESULT HIGHER PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH DOING MORE BUSINESS TO BE SURE. RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE- FOR SURE- BUT WE'RE MOVING MORE CARGO THAN EVER AS WELL SO. I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN BE THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW IS SUSTAINABLE FROM ALWAYS SAYING- THERE ARE CERTAIN PROFITABILITY SWINGS THAT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DISCUSS- BACK AND CERTAINLY YEAH DISCUSSION WE HAVE. BUT NO ONE BELIEVES THAT THIS MARKET PLACES SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TIME LONG TERM- AND- BUT I MIGHT ALSO POINT OUT THAT. THERE ARE BETTER MANY MANY YEARS WHERE ARE INDUSTRY WAS LOSING MONEY- WE'RE CHARGING NON COMPENSATORY RATES. FOR A LOT OF. THE CARRIAGE- BUT CARRIERS A THE BOARD CERTAIN THE CHARGE MORE DEMAND IS IT'S HIDING SUPPLIES SCARCE- AND THAT IS A FUNCTION OF. PLACE SO. WE CAN WE CAN JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES ABOUT THE BUT DON'T THINK. NECESSARILY PROFITABILITY IN OUR SECTOR IS A BAD THING- AND CERTAINLY IT ALLOWS US TO REINVEST. IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO GROW WE DON'T WANT TO NOT BE PROFITABLE FOR LOOKING AT HOW DO WE REINVEST IN THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF ZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO EMISSIONS EQUIPMENT WE NEED- AND THAT THAT'S IT THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE- WITH THE STATE AND- WITH EVERYONE MOVING FORWARD. AGAIN I AGREE NO ONCE AGAIN TO MAKING A PROFIT IT JUST SEEMS EXTREME AT THIS POINT I THINK AT ALL TIME HIGH MY LAST QUESTION IS- WILL THE PORT OF LA'S CONTAINER- TWELVE FEES. SHORTEN WITH THE TIME THAT YOUR MEMBER. COMPANIES LEAVE CONTAINERS AT THE PORT. BUT THINK THAT'S THAT'S A FAN QUESTION- BECAUSE- THE IMPOSITION OF THOSE FEES. ARE REALLY UNCLEAR WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY FILTER INTO THE MARKETPLACE- BUT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE CARGO THAT IS THERE- MOSPORT DESTINATION CARGO WHICH MEANS ONCE IT'S DELIVERED. IT'S ACTUALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY CONSONANTAL CARGO OWNER TO COME IN A RANGE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION TO PICK UP THAT CARGO- SO WHETHER OR NOT YO IMPOSE A FEE ON. ON A OCEAN CARRIER REALLY DOESN'T IMPACT THAT CARGO THAT NEEDS TO BE ARRANGED- AND- BUT IN GENERAL. I THINK AS AN INDUSTRY- SAID I THINK OTHER CARRIERS WOULD AGREE. THAT AS OU LOOK AT THE TENSIONS EMERGE POLICIES THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL TO KEEPING FLUID IN THE SYSTEM- SO IN THE LONG TERM HAVING ADDITIONAL FEES ON ON EXCESSIVE DWELL SHOULD ACCELERATE. THE MOVEMENT OF CARGO I REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE IMPOSED ON SO I THINK THAT THAT'S MAYES BE SEEN ABOUT HOW IT WORKS WITH RESPECT INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS INDIVIDUAL CARRIERS AT THE SPORTS- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT- PERMUTATIONS IN THE MARKET PLACE ABOUT HOW. THESE CHARGES IN MAY OR MAY NOT RELATE TO CONTRACTS. AND BILLS OF LADING AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT- MORE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WELL. SHOULD REDUCED. WALK OF THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU THANK MR J. WITH A SENATOR GONZALEZ A QUESTION. YEAH MORE JUST A COMMON I DO WANT TO THANK- ALL OF PANELISTS IS ALSO A REALLY GOOD- DISCUSSION JAKE. PRESIDENT ONCE ON THIS ACOSTA MR SHIMODA AND DIRECTOR AND DATA- I LIKE THE IDEA THAT- MISTER COSTS AND BROUGHT UP OF THE JOINT OP CENTER AND I'D LOVE TO SEE WHAT THAT YU KNOW LOOKS LIKE AROUND THE- THE NATION AND HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT POTENTIALLY HERE TO. SORT AGGREGATE ARE ARE OPERATIONAL- THAT. OUR OPERATIONS OVERALL- BUT I ALSO WOULD- JUST TOUCH ON WHAT DIRECTOR HEAD OF ASSET AND I AND I OF COURSE AND SOME OF THE HUGE BELIEVER IN THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE AN ADDRESS DIRECTLY THAT MISS CLASSIFICATION ISSUE- AND THE COMPLIANCE ISSUE AS WELL AND THAT NEEDS TO BE EMBEDDED IN THIS DISCUSSION I MEAN AS MUCH AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. LOTS OF- PROFITS BEING MADE AT THIS PORT PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH OF COURSE UP AND DOWN OUR OUR CALIFORNIA PORTS BUT THE WORK FORCE- THAT OUR MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL THAT GET LEFT BEHIND THEY NEED TO BE PART OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS THE WORK FORCE PROGRAMS- BEING DELIVERED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AND I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER AND THAT AND THAT SPACE TO ENSURETHAT WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY BENEFITS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY AGAIN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. THANK YOU SENATORS ALSO MR FONG- A ABOUT MY SON WENT THIS PAN. BY JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- MAYBE FOR CHRIS AND FOR RIDE. I'M JUST TRYING TO WRAP MY HANDS. AROUND WRAP MY HEAD AROUND I THINK WHAT. THE EXTENT OF THE TRUCKER SHORTAGE AND HOW MANY. HOW HOW MUCH SHORT ARE WE AS A STATE HOW MANY TRUCK DRIVERS DO WE NEED. AND WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE SHORTAGE. ALL UP. ALL THE ALL STARS THE DRIVER SHORTAGE IS A NATIONAL ISSUE IF YOU TALK TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS WERE ALL LOOKING FOR DRIVERS- WHAT WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE DRIVER SHORTAGE. IS A ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT IS OCCURRING WITH FOR CONGESTION- HOWEVER- YOU KNOW I THINK A CENTER DAHLE ALLUDED TO IT PREVIOUSLY THAT. DRIVER WAGES ARE OP- MATT ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT MORE DRIVERS INTO THE WORK FORCE- IN THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND I BELIEVE THE NUMBER FOUR OWNER OPERATOR SPECIFICALLY. THEY ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS RIGHT NOW THERE WAS A- ARTICLE IN OVERDRIVE MAGAZINE WHICH IS SORT OF THE TRADE MAGAZINE FOR. OWNER OPERATORS INDICATING THAT SIXTY THOUSAND ISSUE- OWNER OPERATORS ENTER THE MARKET THIS YEAR BECAUSE- WHAT'S CALLED SPOT RATES WHICH IS THEY GO THEY GO OUT AND WORK- YOU KNOW FOR NON CONTRACTED RATES ARE ARE HIGH BECAUSE OF SIMILAR DYNAMICS- DUE TO HIGHER DEMAND AND SO- WITH REGARDS TO TRYING TO ATTRACT MORE DRIVERS INTO THE INDUSTRY OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION IS TRYING TO GET. A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AGES LOWERED FROM AGE TWENTY ONE TO EIGHTEEN. FOR THE REASON THAT- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE LOOKING TO START A TRADE. IF YOU CANNOT START TRACKING UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE RUSINE- POTENTIAL WORKERS TO OTHER- TRADES FOR THREE YEARS- WE DO HAVE THAT ABILITY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU CAN DRIVE IN TRUST STATE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN BUT CANNOT CROSS. STATE LINES ARE HAN HANDLE INTERNATIONAL CARGO SO- THAT IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN JUST WE ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT- WORKERS WITH HIGHER PAY. I HAPPEN TO PROVIDE ANY STATISTICS TO THE S. LIKE COMMITTEE ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S ALSO- AND SUPPORT THEIR VACATION I THINK THAT LOOKING FORWARD- OUT INTO THE FUTURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. WITH THAT THE TRUCK- TRUCKER SHORTAGE IT'S NOT THE REASON WHY THERE'S THAT- CHOKEPOINT AT. THE PORTS BUT TO IT TO GET TO GET THE TO HEART AND SUPPLY CHAIN- MOVING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE SO THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW RON HAD AN ADDITIONAL FROM. YEAH I MEAN INSTRUCTORS. AT THE PORT IS BASICALLY INDEPENDENT- DIARIES THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN- CHARACTERIZED INDENTURED SERVITUDE I THINKING. THAT EVEN THOUGH SOME COMPANIES THAT- SCENE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF RAISING SALARIES NOT ALL CATS. I THINK THAT THAT IT'S VERY VERY CRITICAL THAT. YOU KNOW MY ARGUMENT ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE STATUS IT IS. TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE- YOU KNOW- MISTER ZERO. IS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY AND- TRUCKS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN MONITORS. IF WE GET YOU KNOW THE PORTS EVER GO TO AN ELECTRONIC DISPATCHING. SO- I THINK THAT. IT'S ABOUT JOB QUALITY. THAT WE HAVE THEY RECRUIT- YOU INTO OUR- OUR- IN THIS TRADE THE TRADE THAT I CAME OUT OF. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT LIKE MR PEROT PAID BILLION MUCH SPANIEN I THINK THAT. NEEDS TO. BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY RECRUITMENT AND RECRUITMENT BUT I HAVE TO BE DONE THE- TRAINING AND UNFORTUNATELY. BENEFITS AND WAGES. GREAT THANK YOU- WITHOUT EVER CALMEST. I JUST- LIKELY DRAW TOWARD ADMIN JAKE OF ONE TO UNDER THAT IF THERE'S AN THAT CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THE SHIPPING ASSOCIATION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE AVAILABILITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE PORT OF OAKLAND AS A AS A SOURCE IT'S BEEN UNDER UTILIZED RIGHT NOW AND- IN IN ITS DECISIONS. THANK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- YES THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND OBVIOUSLY I KNOW MY OFFICE OBJECT ON THE SQUARE IN OAKLAND NOW AREN'T WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN MAKING THIS WORK FULLY UTILIZED. WE HAVE THREE MEMBERS THAT HAVE- DEDICATED DIRECT SERVICE CALLS- INCLUDING TWO NUMBERS THAT ARE ALREADY IN SERVICE WITH DIRECT CALLS TO OAKLAND ANOTHER COMING ONLINE IN JANUARY- AND UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE- THAT THE THAT. THE FALLOUTS OF THE DELAYS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT IT PRECLUDES SERVICE POST IN OAKLAND AND IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THE PARTS OF TO COMMON SEATTLE PEOPLE SKIPPING THOSE STOPS SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HELP FACILITATE. CARGO MOVEMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO HELP GET STRINGS REESTABLISH THE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE MOVING SO WE WANT TO DO BOTH WE WANT TO. INCREASE DIRECT SERVICE OAKLAND BUT WE ALSO WANT TO GET SHIPS MILLION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BACK ON SCHEDULE- SO THEY'RE CALLING IN OAKLAND TO. BUT IT IS A- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU CAN TO SEE YOU. YEAH THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS MUST AYE YOU SAID QUITE IS REALLY TO RECRUITMENT NO DOUBT A WORK WORKER SHORTAGE SHOWING CAREY SONG WHAT ARE I. B. I MEAN I O. W. AND THE TEAM SHE WAS DOING TO RECRUIT WERE YOU RECRUITING SUCH A LACK OF DIVERSITY- BOTH IN- GENDER AND- ETHNICITY. I KNOW FIRST SENATOR- BUT I CAN ONLY SPEAK IN IN MY ARENA- AND THAT THE UNIONIZED TRUCK DRIVING COURSE WHERE- I PREACH THAT IF YOU WANNA AND SYSTEMIC RACISM IF YOU WANT EQUALITY IF YOU WANT WAIT. DO YOU WANT INDUSTRY STANDARD THEN JOINED THE TEAMSTERS AND ALLOW US TO. BARGAIN A CONTRACT FOR YOU- OVER ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT THAT WAY. SO I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR MY BROTHER NOT MINE BUT DEFINITELY ON OUR SIDE SIR. WE'RE DOING IN OUR OUR OUR- DO DEAL. THAT YOU KNOW MAKES THAT. COLOR AND- GENDER IS THE PRIORITY HERE BUT OUR CONTRACTS- HE DID THAT ON THEIR OWN. MISTER BARCELONA STILL ON. YEAH YES AND- I SUPPORT A BUT HERNANDEZ INVENTURE TO CONTINUE. TO- YOU SEE WAGES BENEFITS TO OPERATORS ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA- AS FAR AS THE OUT OF THE U. IN THE PACIFIC MARITIME WE HAVE AN ONLINE. MOVEMENT OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WE ALREADY HVE A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THE PMA AND THE- UNION HAVE ALL. ATTAINTED THAT LESS IS WON'T WORK ENOUGH NOW WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THE SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE A LABOR SHORTAGE WE HAVE THE REASON WHY JUST NOT SEEN WORK REFORMS BECAUSE INCOMES ARE TO CLOG TO OPERATE A VESSEL. I JUST THE OTHER DAY EVERGREEN HAD TO SHUT DOWN WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS THE BAY HERE- THEY HAD TO SHUT DOWN THEIR SHIP OPERATION BECAUSE THERE'S NO MORE WE ARE. SO THIS AS THEY'VE SHOT WE DON'T AT HAVE A LABOR SHORTAGE HERE IN. SEVENTY- AND WE'RE CONTINUE TO MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH OUR SYSTEM- INTO HIGHER RANKS OF OUR SYSTEM AND- MOVED MORE PEOPLE OFF THE LIST THAT- TO BRING HIM INTO THE SYSTEM TO- WORK DOWN OR JUST A CASUAL.
