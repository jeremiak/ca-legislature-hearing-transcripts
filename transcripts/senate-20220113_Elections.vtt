00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.115
HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.683
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.853
SEE. HAPPEN I KNOW THAT- A

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.022
COUPLE OBSERVATIONS IRRESPECTIVE

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.558
OF THAT ONE IS THAT. IT

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.159
TYPICALLY WOULD WOULD LIKE TO

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.128
SEE EFFORTS CONCRETE EFFORTS

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.896
MADE TO MAKE THESE TYPES OF

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.565
CHANGES ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.100
NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT ANY MOTIONS

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.769
BEEN PUT BEFORE THE BOARD.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.571
PASTOR DEFEATED TO- TO ADVANCE

00:13:58.637 --> 00:13:59.905
THIS AND THAT THAT'S ALWAYS AT

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.807
MY VIEW OF. A BEST PRACTICE TO

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.876
TRY TO. EXHAUST THOSE REMEDIES

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:07.112
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- SECOND AND

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.048
THIS GOES BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.050
ISSUE AN ORANGE COUNTY BUT- I

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.685
CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE THAT- AND

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:15.221
NOVEMBER ELECTION HAS A MUCH

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:15.988
GREATER TURNOUT. BUT THERE IS

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:17.957
ANOTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.959
THAT COME OUT OF THAT.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.528
CIRCUMSTANCE ONE IS THAT YOU

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.230
LOOK AT THE DROP OFF ON THE

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.598
BALLOT FROM THE TOP OF THE

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:27.633
BALLOT TO THE BOTTOM. AND I

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.834
THINK THAT IN. MOST CASES IN

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.736
GENERAL ELECTIONS YOU SEE A

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:31.870
SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF. DOESN'T

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:33.772
MEAN THAT EVEN WITH THE DROP OFF

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.741
THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL IS STILL

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.676
GREATER IN A GENERAL ELECTION IT

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:39.445
COULD VERY WELL STILL BE.

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:42.414
GREATER BUT PART OF THE EASON

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.483
THAT THAT THAT DROP OFF HAPPENS.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.986
IS BECAUSE THE- THE ATTENTION

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:49.888
PAID TO THESE LOWER TIER OFFICES

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.423
IN GENERAL ELECTIONS IS

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.927
SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHED. AND

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:57.062
THE COST OF CAMPAIGNING IN THE

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.264
GENERAL ELECTION IS

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.401
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER. THE DALLAS

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.068
IS POINTS OUT THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.404
TURNOUT. AB TWEEN THE PRIMARY

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.939
AND GENERAL IN ORANGE COUNTY AND

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:07.906
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.275
BUT IT'S ALSO A SUBSTANTIAL

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.176
DIFFERENCE IN THE COST OF

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.111
CAMPAIGNING ON THAT

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.979
JURISDICTION'S. WE COMPLAIN A

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:17.516
LOT ABOUT THE MONEY AND POLITICS

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.019
. AND YET- CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.920
THIS MAKE IT EVEN MORE

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.455
EXPENSIVE. AND SO IT'S A

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:26.892
CHALLENGE HOW DO WE GET GREATER

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.861
COVERAGE OF THESE RACES.

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.195
WITNESSES AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:31.864
MAKE IT CLEAR HOW IMPORTANT THIS

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.500
ELECTION IS FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:37.903
POSITION- AND YT. WE STRUGGLE

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.705
TO GET ANY ATTENTION. AND I

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:40.973
THINK IF YOU SURVEYED THOSE WHO

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.509
RUN FOR THE BOARD OF EDUCATION

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.777
NOT JUST IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:45.577
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YOU'LL

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.146
HEAR THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.315
GETTING THEIR MESSAGE OUT. IT'S

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.350
A IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE SO.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.218
I THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:53.819
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WE

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:56.255
CONSOLIDATE- NEVERTHELESS I'M

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.090
