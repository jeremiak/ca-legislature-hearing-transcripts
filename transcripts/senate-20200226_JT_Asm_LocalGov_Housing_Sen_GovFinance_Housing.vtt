PORCH OUR- WHERE TO GENERATE

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.644
THAT REVENUE AND SO I DON'T

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.747

WANTING TO GENERATE THAT

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:45.983
REVENUE THE PROBLEM IS THAT

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.551
BECOMES THE EASIEST PATH TO DO

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:49.687

OUR ABILITY TO BUILD MORE

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.628
HOUSINGBECAUSE IT MAKES

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.697
HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.665
NOT BLAME CRITICIZING CITIES

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.075
SAFETY AND PARKS AND SO FORTH

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:14.912
IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.081
TO EXACERBATE HOMELESSNESS

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:19.116
CONTINUE TO RESTRICT THE SUPPLY

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.985

A WHILE THERE WAS ANOTHER CASE

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:24.060

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.295
COUPLE DECADES LATER THAT

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:26.829

PASSED. OVER FORTY YEARS AGO

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:51.254

OUR- WAY TO ADDRESS. I'M JUST

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.395
WAS JUST WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.531
INCLUDED IN THE NARRATIVE SO

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.700
SUBSEQUENT TO PROP THIRTEEN IN

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE LOOKING

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.203

AND THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:40.763
WHY CHARGE IMPACT THESE AS MOST

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.065

NEW RESIDENT. IT'S BASICALLY

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:03.105
SAYING THAT NEW RESIDENTS HAVE

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.241

MUCH MORE SO THAN OTHER TAXES

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.294

ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO DRY

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.430

THIRTEEN PROPERTY TAXES ARE WE

HAD JUST PURCHASED A HOME AND

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.679
COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD. OUR

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.781
PROPERTY TAXES AT THAT TIME

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:55.551
THAT WE NINETEEN NOT. EQUAL

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.653
SIXTY EARLY SO PROP THIRTEEN

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.754
KING IN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.289
LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE

PROPERTY TAXES WERE INCREASING

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:04.226
SIGNIFICANTLY. SO I THINK WE

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:06.829
NEED A KING AND A BALANCED OF

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:11.367
MITIGATION FEE. INCREASED THE

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:14.503
COST WELCOME TO KNOW CAN ON FOR

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.070
TO. OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.639
YEARS WE'VE HAD PROP THIRTEEN I

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.841
THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:19.842
COMPONENT IN THIS DISCUSSION

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.877
BECAUSE- IT WAS A SENIOR

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.145
COMMUNITIES THAT WERE REALLY

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:25.614
HIT AND I KNOW THAT. PERSONALLY

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.383
WELL MY FATHER WAS A BANKER AT

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.151
THE TIME AND THE ONLY WAY WE

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.586
WERE ABLE TO SAVE OUR HOME. IS

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:33.288
BECAUSE HE GAVE US ALONE WHEN

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:35.624
OUR INCOME WHO IS. PROBABLY LOW

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.626
LOW LOW INCOME AT THAT TIME AS

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.228
MY HUSBAND WAS A STUDENT AND I

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.430
HAD JUST STARTED IN A JOB. IN

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:44.867
MY MONTHLY INCOME WAS FOUR

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:45.467
HUNDRED SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. IN

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.403
OUR PRICE TAG IS OR SOMETHING

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:50.239
LIKE TO STOP IN AT THAT TIME.

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:53.776
SO WE NEED TO THE- I WOULD

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:56.512
ASSUME LEO AND SOME DO THE-

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:57.112
FISCAL ANALYSIS. WE GO DOWN

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.313
THERE ROAD GIVE US COMPARE OF

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.049
WHERE WE WOULD BE. IF WE DIDN'T

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:02.751
HAVE- MITIGATION BELARUS WAS

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.620
HUGE IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY WOW

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.754
THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.256
BUILD THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:09.058
HAVE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.926
BASICALLY LOOK NOW FOR

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.428
PROPERTIES THAT DON'T HAVE MEL

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.395
REDUCE ARE ALREADY PAID THEM

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:15.330
OUT. AS AN INTERN MORE LUCK

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:16.465
MENTION BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.866
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THAT

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.535
TIME PEOPLE IN THE NEW

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:22.638
DEVELOPMENTS ON WE HERE AT THE

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:23.806
200-082-0009 RECESSION. OR LOSE

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.574
THEIR HOMES NOT BECAUSE OF

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.675
THEIR PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE OF

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.745
THEIR MIL ROUTE. WHICH WAS

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:32.448
USED. AS ANOTHER WAY TO BUILD

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.383
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE'RE NOT

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:38.620
ABOUT PEOPLE. I'M HAVING MORE.

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.489
SERVICE HE WAS. THERE WAS NO

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.490
THE STATION IN THE RURAL AREAS

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.459
THE THREE. TO SOURCE ON FIRE.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:46.028
SO THE LOWERS OR TO. PO SAFETY

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.963
AT THAT TIME SO WE NEED TO LOOK

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.332
AT THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT WE'VE

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.600
GOT HERE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:52.735
HAVE A BALLOT AND NOT.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.570
DEMONIZING ONE AGAINST THE

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.705
OTHER BECAUSE WE GOING FORWARD

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.207
THERE'S A SOLUTION I THINK WE

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.007
ALL BELIEVE THAT OR WE WOULDN'T

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.943
BE IN THIS ROOM. BUT WE NEED TO

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.479
LOOK AT HOW WE GOT HERE BUT

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:04.546
WHAT IF WE WEREN'T HERE WITH

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:07.416
MEDICATION VIEWS WERE. PROPERTY

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:08.317
TAXES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD WE HAVE

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:09.551
AFFORDABLE. IN BASED ON MY

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:10.886
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ALL THOSE

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.354
YEARS AGO NO WE WOULDN'T

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.756
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DOWN. SO I

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:15.891
JUST ADD THAT TO OUR DISCUSSION

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.826
AND I LOOK TO OUR EXPERTS TO.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.027
DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT SO WE

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.130
BRING SOME BACK. TO OUR- OUR

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:23.632

TOPIC IS HOW DID WE GET HERE

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.650

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:59.635
ENOUGH REVENUE TO DO- THINGS

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.837
THAT. EXPECTS CITIES. GOOD

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.605
LIBRARY SERVICE PARK SERVICES

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:06.642
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND IN

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.611
MANY COMMUNITIES. THE CITY

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:12.714
JURISDICTION GREW. AND INCLUDED

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.817
COUNTY AND INCORPORATED

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:17.352
NEIGHBORS THAT HAD NO CURBS

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:19.154
GUTTERS SIDEWALKS SEWERS AND

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.089
WATER SERVICE THEY WERE ON

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:24.193
WELLS AND- YET WHEN THE

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.261
ANNEXATION OCCURRED. THOSE

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:28.363
IMPROVEMENTS WEREN'T OFFERED TO

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.532
THE RESIDENCE. MOSTLY BECAUSE

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:31.800
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:32.935
PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.937
THE- CITY THAT WAS GROWING

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:37.339
DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY- WE'VE

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.974
SOLVED THAT PROBLEM NOW IN

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:41.476
REQUIRE ANNEXATION BUT- I HAVE

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.579
A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN IN

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.215
MY DISTRICT. THAT HAVE COUNTY

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.617
AND INCORPORATE IT INSIDE CITY

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:51.053
LIMITS AND THAT ARE IN

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:53.722
ATROCIOUS SHAPE AND SO WHEN WE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:59.161
START LOOKING AT FEES AND- AND-

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.296
I'M- I KNEW. IT'S PART OF THE

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:03.465
WAY THAT YOU GET THE CAPITAL TO

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.801
BE ABLE TO ADD PARK SERVICES TO

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:09.404
ADD- LIBRARY SERVICES AND- IN

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:11.440
IN MY COMMUNITY I RAN THIRTY

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.041
YEARS AGO AS A CITY COUNCIL

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.077
MEMBER TO EXPAND OUR LIBRARY

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.712
AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH IMPACT

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:17.279
FEES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:20.482
BUT IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS SO- SO

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.718
THE CHALLENGES I THINK WE IS

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:25.687
THAT- MEAN THERE REALLY ARE IN

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.789
WHEN HE'S IN MUNICH IS IN PART

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:31.793
OF WITH COUNCILS AND THE BOARD

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:32.394
OF SUPERVISORS. MAYBE TRYING

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:33.028
ROUTE HOW CAN THE STANDARD UP

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:36.365
FOR EVERYONE. AND I WOULD AGREE

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.199
WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT IT

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.935
SHOULD BE- CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.803
NOT ONGOING SERVICES BECAUSE

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.739
THAT I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:44.907
FOR THE REST OF THE RESIDENTS

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:45.807
BUT AYE AYE THIS IS AN

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.677
INTERESTING- DISCUSSION I

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:49.745
EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:52.214
TO HAVE MORE- DISCUSSIONS ON

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.049
THIS IS WE SEE SOME OF THE

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:56.652
BILLS COME AROUND BUT- BUT I'VE

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:59.221
BEEN SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS IN

01:15:59.288 --> 01:15:59.955
LOCAL COVER. AND PROTECT THE

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:02.424
ABILITY ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.726

I AM SENATOR AT LAST. QUESTION

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:14.036
FOR MR DONE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.305
TALK TO US ABOUT SOFT COSTS

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:20.175
VERSUS HEART COSTS. AND THEY

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:23.812
GIVE US EXAMPLE OF THAT. 6270%

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.781
OF THE HOMES COST IS GOING TO

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.783
BE MATERIALS AND LABOR. AND YOU

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.451
BREAK DOWN THE SOFT COSTS COULD

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.187
BE 2230% IF POTENTIALLY 5% OF

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.323
THAT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT-

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:37.592
IT IS. FEES TALK ABOUT THAT A

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:38.894
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.129
THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT. WE NEED

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.598
TO RAISE TODAY- AND KNOW THAT

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.100
THERE'S ONGOING PRESSURE ON

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.001
THIS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.669
CRITICAL ISSUE WHEN. HOUSING

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:49.071
SHORTAGE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:49.771
THAT WE HEAR FROM LOCAL

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:50.839
GOVERNMENT AND IF YOU WANT TO

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.607
COMMENT ON THAT SINCE YOU

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.042
REPRESENT THEM WELL. AGAIN I

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.678
THINK IT'S DOWN TO THE

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:59.314
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFILL

01:16:59.381 --> 01:16:59.915
DEVELOPMENT VERSUS. ONE ANGLER

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.084
HERE. OUR THE IMPACT INFILL

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:02.985
DEVELOPMENT WHERE YOU DON'T

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.287
NEED TO EXTEND SEWER PROBABLY

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.588
WE DON'T NEED TO EXTEND ROADS

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.824
ARE REALLY KIND OF A- THAT IT'S

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.993
HARD TO TALK ABOUT IMPACT FEES

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.361
IN IN NUMBERS LIKE RUN NUMBERS

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:13.428
LIKE 5% WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:14.896
ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.498
DEVELOPMENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.500
ABOUT A SUBDIVISION- ROSEVILLE

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.168
VERSUS AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT A

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:22.971
LOS ANGELES THOSE ARE TWO

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:23.872
DIFFERENT THINGS AND- PROBABLY.

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.640
OF THREE DIFFERENT CONSULT

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.209
THESE IMPACTS AND HAVING THREE

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:28.377
DIFFERENT RESULTS AT WHAT THE

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.178
IMPACTS REALLY ARE SO WHEN YOU

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:33.648
START TALKING ABOUT FEES AND

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.751
WHO SHOULD BE PAYING THEM AND

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.119
IN ONE WHAT TYPE TO DELIVER THE

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.987
SHOULD BE READ ONLINE IT'S

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:40.889
DIFFICULT TO HAVE A ONE SIZE

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:46.695

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:03.111
PERCENTAGES IN SOME RESPECTS

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.914
BECAUSE THE- ALBUMS THAT WE

EASY TO HATE. BUT FOR THE MOST

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:42.544
IN MOST CASES THEY'RE NOT THAT

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.912
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THERE ARE

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:45.680

CITIES THAT ARE GROWING UP FAST

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.892

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:57.726
THE HIGHEST IMPACT FEES AND

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:00.428

ALLOW EXPANSION AND THERE'S A

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:07.235
POTENTIAL LIMITING THAT THE HE

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:10.705
IS THE LIMIT THE FAST SAID THIS.

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:11.907
WITH THAT SAID I WILL ORGANIZE

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.842

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.908
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IS

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.743
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DOLLARS AND

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.279
THE WORK AS A MATCH AND VOTE

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.680
MUCH LIKE YOUR YOUR RETIREMENT

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:27.949
PLAN EXCEPT IT'S NOT A ONE TO

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:28.950
ONE MATCH USUALLY AFFORDABLE

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.285
HOUSING DEVELOPER WILL GET

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:33.188
MULTIPLE DOLLARS THREE OR MORE

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:35.223
FOR EACH DOLLAR THAT THEY BUILT

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.958
FREE LOCAL DOLLAR THEY PRETTY

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.728
WHICH EVEN MORE WITH BACK TO

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:42.397
ANOTHER OF COURSE ISN'T.

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.899
THEY'RE SORT. I WILL NEVER PAY

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.067
THE FULL SOURCE OF UP A FOR

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:47.369
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEY

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.337
NEED THE PROJECTS ONLY PENCIL

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.806
IF THAT IF THE CITY CONTRIBUTES

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:53.575
AS WELL AND IN ONE OF THE

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:54.909
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WITH

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:57.512
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS IS

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.415
THAT LOCAL MONEY IS ONLY IT'LL

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.883
PAY FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT- OR

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.486
EARLY CALL FEASIBILITY THE

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:05.654
GOVERNMENT WILL PAY FOR IT AND

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.255
BACK. PAY FOR IT YOU NEED THAT

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:10.225
WOULD NEED TO LOCAL THE MONEY

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.192
TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK. SO MY

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.727
SECOND POINT IS GENERALLY

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.562
IMPACT FEES PUSH DOWN THE PRICE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:16.431
OF DEVELOP A LAND THAT'S THEIR

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.066
MEAN A FACT. REAL ESTATE

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.868
ECONOMICS IS COMPLICATED BUT IT

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.436
REALLY BOILS DOWN TO SALES

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.905
PRICE CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:25.874
PROFITS AND LAND CROSS.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.275
STARTING AT THE END THE SALES

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.210
PRICE IS SET BY THE MARKET THE

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:31.246
DEVELOPER REALLY HAS VERY

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.315
LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT TO THE-

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.183
IT'S DETERMINED BY EVERYONE

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.484
LOOKING FOR HOUSES AND THERE'S

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.619
ENOUGH HOUSES ON THE MARKET

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.821
THAT IF. IF THE PRICE IS TO THE

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.723
BUYER WILL JUST GO ELSEWHERE

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.391
YOU CAN'T PAY MORE YOU CAN

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.759
EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY MORE AND

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.561
GET LESS SOMETIMES IT WORKS FOR

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.395
THE DEVELOPERS ADVANTAGES

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:48.963
PRICES INCREASED WHILE THEY'RE

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.931
DOING CONSTRUCTION THEY'LL

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.566
INCREASE THEIR PRICES. AND

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.634
SOMETIMES IF THEY'RE COSTS

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:56.304
INCREASE IT THEY DON'T THAT

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.605
THEY'D SO THEY SUFFER. SIMILAR

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:58.606
DEVELOPERS HAVE VERY LITTLE

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.342
CONTROL OVER CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.843
THERE'S NO ONE NOTHING THEY CAN

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.079
SAY TO A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.647
TO GET THEM TO GIVE THEM A

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.648
LOWER BID THOSE COSTS FROM THE

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.049
DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE OUR

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.452
FIX. HAS ARE THE PROFITS

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.953
DEVELOPERS HAVE THEIR TARGETS

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:12.754
AND WHEREVER THEY'RE GETTING

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.723
THEIR MONEY FROM THE PENSION

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.691
FUND OUR BANK OR WHEREVER. THEY

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:17.992
ALL HAVE THOSE THRESHOLD SO FOR

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.427
DEVELOPER CAN'T MAKE THAT

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.397
PROFIT THRESHOLD THEY JUST

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.765
WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THE

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.834
DEVELOPMENT. THE ONLY THING THE

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.136
ONLY. THERE'S A YOU ROOM IN

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.104
QUESTION IS PLAN PRICES WHEN

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.905
PRICES ARE A DIRECT DIRECT

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:33.375
REFLECTION OF HOW MUCH

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:35.777
DEVELOPMENT IS POSSIBLE. SO IF

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.746
CITY THESE OPENS IN DOUBLES THE

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.448
NUMBER OF UNITS THERE ALLOWED.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:44.386
OR HOUSING PRICES. THE AND PUSH

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.454
THE PRESS THE PRICE. IF THERE'S

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:47.922
ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.290
ARE IMPACT FEES DEVELOPERS WILL

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.792
DOES NOT BE ABLE TO PAY AS MUCH

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.328
FOR PRICE FOR LAND AND OVER

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:53.928
TIME THE PRICE OF LAND WILL GO

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.297
DOWN. YOU CAN SEE IT FINAL

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:58.400
SALES PRICE YOU START WITH THAT

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:00.602
YOU REMOVE CONSTRUCTION COST IN

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:02.170
THE PROFITS IN IN THE TOP

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.439
EXAMPLES FIFTY DOLLARS I AM

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.174
VERY SIMPLE NUMBERS IN THE

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.876
BOTTOM EXAMPLE WE ADDED ON FIVE

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.145
DOLLARS A FIVE POINT YOU'VE GOT

01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:11.413
ON FIVE DOLLARS TO THE

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.014
CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN THE NET

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.849
EFFECT IS NOT ON FOR ONE BUT

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.585
PRETTY CLOSE THE- UC THE PRICES

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.921
THE PRICE FOR LAND DOWN. WHICH

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:22.757
BRINGS UP TO TWENTY THIRD POINT

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.459
WHICH TO FOCUS ON THE BAD

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:25.393
ACTORS BECAUSE WHAT'LL HAPPEN

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.796
SOME TIMES IS IT FEES ARE SO

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:31.666
HIGH THIS LAND PRICE. THE

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.002
DEVELOPERS PLAN ISN'T ENOUGH TO

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.069
ACTUALLY BUY THE LAND IT'S MORE

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:37.572
IN THE PROPERTY OWNERS INTEREST

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.107

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:42.310
A USED CAR LOT OR A MCDONALD'S

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.412

THAT PREVENT NEW DEVELOPMENT

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:54.122
FROM HAPPENING. SO THERE ARE

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.423
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.025
SOME CITIES THAT ARE USING

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:59.160
THEIR FEES TO PREVENT NEW

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:00.595
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE MOST PART

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:03.198
IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF

AND THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE THE

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.639
PRICES OF ELATION IS VERY STEEP

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.174
IT'S IN THE AREA OF FIRE

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.176
PROTECTION. AS FIREFIGHTERS

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:49.410
WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.712
TRENDS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:53.114
EACH OTHER. ON ONE HAND IT'S

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:55.049
GROWING THREAT POSED BY DROUGHT

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:57.485
AND WILDFIRE. AND THAT'S THE

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:58.186
WRITTEN IN OUR URBAN AND

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.221
SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:01.756
WHAT WE CALL THE WILDLAND URBAN

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.525
INTERFACE AT THE SAME TIME THE

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:04.859
NEED FOR HOUSING CONTINUES TO

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.194
PUSH DEVELOPMENT FURTHER AND

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.429
FURTHER INTO THESE HIGHLY RISKY

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.899
AREAS. SAYS WE ARE DEVELOPING

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.400
OUT WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING UP

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.969
MORE MORE HIGH DENSITY HOUSING

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.438
TALLER AND TALLER STRUCTURES SO

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.841
MORE PEOPLE MORE STRUCTURED AND

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:22.110
MORE TERRITORY TO COVER. ALL

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:25.213
THAT TRANSLATES TO GREAT- RISA

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.414
TO LIVES AND PROPERTY AND

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.383
SPECIAL FAR DISTRICTS LIKE THE

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:30.285
ONE I WORK FOR AND THE ONES I

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.353
REPRESENT MEETING THIS

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.855
CHALLENGE IS EVEN HARDER.

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.657
SINGLE PURPOSE FIRE DISTRICT

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:36.624
ESSENTIALLY ARE RUNNING ON A

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.560
FIXED INCOME AND THAT'S JUST

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.795
PROPERTY TAXES. I LIKE CITIES

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.196
AND COUNTIES BAR DISTRICTS

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:44.599
CAN'T GO OUT AND RAISE SALES

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.834
TAXES- TO PAY FOR EVER

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.937
EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT. AND EVEN

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:50.538
WORSE MANY SPECIAL DISTRICTS

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.407
ARE STUCK WITH OUTDATED

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:55.009
DISTRIBUTION FORMULAS ESTABLISH

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:57.512
BY PROP THIRTEEN. EVEN WHEN THE

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.047
NEW DEVELOPMENT OCCURS THERE'S

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.582
NO GUARANTEE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:01.916
REVENUE WILL GO TO THE SPECIAL

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:03.217
DISTRICTS. AND A LOT OF THAT

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.153
NEW DEVELOPMENT THE TAX RATE.

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:08.356
IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED- BY PROP

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:09.824
THIRTEEN SO AN AREA. THAT'S NOT

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:10.925
EVEN DEVELOP WERE ALREADY

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:13.194
HABITS TAX RATE ESTABLISH AN

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.996
AND SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.731
THAT DEVELOPMENT. YOU KNOW THAT

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.566
WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT. SO AS A

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.201
STANDS RIGHT NOW IMPACT FEES

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:22.704
ARE THE- THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.305
BEGIN TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:27.508
THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE. THE

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:28.810
NEEDS WE FACE. FIRE DISTRICTS

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:31.746
IMPACT FEES ARE USED TO BUILD

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:34.515
NEW FIRE STATIONS. PURCHASED

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.985
NEW APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:38.219
AND SO TO GIVE AND I ARE YOU

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:41.189
ALSO FIRE ENGINE IS AROUND

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:41.789
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:43.458
TO A MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEY

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.226
RECOMMENDED THAT THEIR REPLACED

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:46.995
EVERY TEN YEARS OR EVERY

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:48.029
HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MILES.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.164
SO FOR FIRE STATIONS THERE'S A

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:51.265
COST OF THE LAND IN THE

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:54.369
CONSTRUCTION IN THESE. AREAS

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:54.836
FACE AND MORE AND MORE

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.437
DEVELOPMENT. AND ONCE AGAIN

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:59.073
THEIR ESTABLISHED OF TAX RATES

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.842
ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SO YOU

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:03.978
CAN ADJUST. TO WHAT THAT

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:05.580
COMMUNITIES GONNA LOOK LIKE.

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:06.981
AND THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY THESE

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:08.583
ESSENTIAL PURCHASES CAN BE MADE

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:10.685
WITH ARE RESTRICTED OPERATING

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.553
BUDGETS. JUST GIVE ME AN

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.622
EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE MOST

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.557
IMPORTANT WE HAVE A COUPLE

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:18.826
MAJOR EXPANSION PROJECTS IN

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.595
GOING ON A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY-

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.363
WHICH IS SIMILAR GRAYSON AWARE

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.932
OF WE HAVE A- CONCORD OF NAVAL

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.235
WEAPONS- THAT'S SCHEDULED TO BE

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.037
REDEVELOPED. AS WELL AS

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:31.339
NORTHERN WATER CURRENT. IN A

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.040
LOT OF THOSE AREAS ARE TO BE

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:34.108
COVERED BY. FIRE FIRE

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.576
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE FIRE

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.812
DISTRICTS- LIKE I SAID THERE'S

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:38.713
A BIG DIFFERENCE ABOUT

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.781
REPRESENTING TO CITY

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.949
DEPARTMENTS. AS WELL LIKE

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:42.850
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.986
BETWEEN HOW YOU CAN MANAGE OF

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:48.556
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT- SO AS A

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:49.590
WHOLE RANGE DEVELOPMENT

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:52.193
PROJECTS. THAT LET ME MOVE ON.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.862
SO WITHOUT IMPACT FEES IT WOULD

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.364
BE TOUGH TO PUT FIRE AND

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:58.232
MEDICAL PROTECTION CLOSE. TO

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:00.301
WHERE WOULD BE NEEDED. FOR US

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:01.602
HOWEVER IMPACT FEES IS THE ONLY

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.871
WAY IS THE ONLY PART OF THE

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.573
CRITICAL FUNDED EQUATION. SINCE

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.208
THESE BABIES CAN ONLY BE USED

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.777
FOR CAPITAL CAPITAL EXPENSES

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.079
THAT STILL LEAVES THE QUESTION

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:11.913
OF STAFFING THESE GROWING

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:14.382
DEMANDS. ALL THE FIRE ENGINES

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.017
IN A ROW CAN'T SAVE A LIFE IF

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.419
THERE'S NOBODY THERE STEP. SO

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:19.687
THE LIMIT TEMPO BY PROP

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:20.922
THIRTEEN ALLOCATIONS AND

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:22.757
SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAS CREATED

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.325
AN IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.127
CHOICES FOR THOSE OF US ON THE

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.795
FRONT LINES. RECENTLY IN

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.497
ELDORADO COUNTY OF A FIRE CHIEF

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.633

FIREFIGHTERS JOB AFTER A

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:36.471
MEASURE. OF FAILED OUT THERE.

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.372
THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:40.675
AGAIN CONSIDERING ACA ONE

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:43.377
UNKNOWN- AND IF APPROVED BY

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.313
LEGISLATION VOTERS IT WOULD.

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:47.615
GIVE VOTERS AN OPTION TO

THE IMPACT FEES WE STILL FACE A

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.794
CRITICAL CHALLENGE. THAT WILL

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.763
GROW AS DEVELOPMENT WIDENS IN

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.865
THE FIRE DANGER INCREASES. BUT

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.601
WITHOUT IMPACT FEES WE HAVE NO

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:07.068

BETWEEN IMPACT FEES AARON

CONNECTION FEES THESE ARE VERY

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.237
DIFFERENT FROM IMPACT FEES.

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.540
IMPACT FEES ARE GENERALLY PAID

01:36:52.606 --> 01:36:53.941
TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.309
DEVELOPMENT THINGS SUCH AS

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.745
TRANSPORTATION COST. A

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:58.812
CONNECTION BE AS DIFFERENT AS I

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:01.448
SAT. CONNECTION FEE IS CHARGED

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.117
TO COVER THE COST DIRECTLY

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.818
ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTING A

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:07.721
PARCEL PLAN. OF A DEVELOPMENT.

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:10.124
WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM. IT

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:12.226
IS BASED ON THE COST OF CAPITAL

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.728
THE EXACT COST OF CAPITAL. EACH

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:15.963
PROPERTY PAYS FOR THE CAPITAL

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.431
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:18.199
THE WATER AND SEWER

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:19.767
INFRASTRUCTURE AS NEEDED TO

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.602
SERVE THAT PROPERTY AND THEY

ARE CHARGED A CONNECTION B. AS

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.174
THE TERM SCRIBES. WHEN THE

CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM NOT

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:31.111
BEFORE. AND I ARE W. D. THE

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.346
COST OF FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.748
IS SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.850
DEVELOPERS WHO PAYS FOR

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:37.518
CONNECTION FEES THAT'S HOW THEY

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:39.420
PAY FOR IT. AND THE PROPERTY

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:40.821
OWNER WHO PAYS FOR THROUGH

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:43.090
PROPERTY TAXES IT SPLIT FIFTY

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:46.060
FIFTY. COST THE CORRESPONDENCE

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:47.428
CORRESPOND WITH THE DEMANDED

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:49.330
INTENSITY BASED ON THE USE OF

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:51.165
THE PROPERTY SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:52.733
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES WILL

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.635
PAY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DEMANDS

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:55.603
IT'S ALL BASED ON DEMANDS OF

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:57.371
THE SYSTEM. AND A COMMERCIAL

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.406
BUILDING EQUALLY WILL PAY BASED

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.575
ON BASED UPON THEIR EXPECTED

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.711
DEMANDS OF THE SYSTEM. SO LET'S

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:06.380
TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:07.748
CONNECTION FEES ARE COST BASE

01:38:07.815 --> 01:38:08.949
BECAUSE I'VE MENTIONED THAT

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:11.085
BEFORE. AND I ARE W. D. WE SAID

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:13.320
OKAY IN FEES TO ENSURE THE NEW

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.555
DEVELOPMENT PAYS FOR ITS FOR A

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:17.358
FAIR SHARE IT'S ALL ABOUT

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:17.992
EVERYBODY PAYING FOR THEIR FAIR

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:20.361
SHARE. THE I AM AND IT'S BASED

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.029
ON THE FAIR SHARE OF CAPITAL

01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:23.397

WASTEWATER SERVICE JUST AS

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.302
PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PAID

01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:29.937
FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE WELL NOT

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:31.705
SUBSIDIZING. THE FUTURE

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.207
DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT'S VERY

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:36.143
IMPORTANT. THE GOAL. IS THAT

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:38.178
ONE PROPERTY NOT SUBSIDIZING

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.046
ANOTHER SHARE OF THE

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:45.686
PROPERTY NEEDS ARE AGAIN

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:47.288
EVERYONE IS PAID FOR THEIR FAIR

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:50.190
SHARE. WE LOOK AT CAPITAL COST

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.125
FOR BOTH LOCAL AND REGIONAL

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:53.527
FACILITIES NEEDED TO SERVE NEW

ACCORDINGLY BASED ON THE

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.499
RESPECTIVE SHARE. SO EXAMPLE

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:00.601
FOR A LOCAL LOW COST THOSE ARE

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:01.835
BASED ON THE LOCAL

WANT TO SEE THE FEW GROW BUT HE

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.213
SAID TRANSPORTATION'S IMPORTANT

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.314
THAT THE DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY

BEST PRACTICE TO REDUCE FEES

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:18.878
FOR AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS%

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.713
THEY THINK SOME CITIES HAVE

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.915
POLICIES ABOUT IT MOST DO IT IN

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:25.018
PRACTICE BECAUSE IF THE CITY IS

01:55:25.084 --> 01:55:27.353
PUTTING IN MONEY ANY WAY YEAH.

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.255
IT'S JUST AN ACCOUNTING THING

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:30.156
FOR THEM TO REQUIRE THE

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:35.428
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER.

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:36.029
TO PAY WHATEVER OTHER IMPACT

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:38.731
FEES BECAUSE THEN THE DEVELOPER

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:39.299
WILL NEED MORE MONEY TO MAKE

01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:43.303
THEIR THEIR- DEVELOPMENT ITSELF

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:46.673
BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A GOOD. A

01:55:46.739 --> 01:55:48.975
GOOD SPROUT. MOST DEE IS WILL

01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:50.610
HAVE THEIR FEES JUST BASED ON

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:55.081
EITHER- PER UNIT OR- PER SQUARE

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:58.584
FOOT. SOMETIMES I'VE SEEN

01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:00.987
CITIES TRYING TO- IT AS A

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:02.755
PERCENTAGE OF SALES PRICE BUT

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:03.956
IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.525
COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:08.561
KNOW THAT UNTIL THE END AND SO

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:09.128
MOST CITIES DON'T DON'T USE

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:15.301
THAT METHOD SO. PER UNIT. BY

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:18.237
DEFINITION DISCRIMINATES

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.139
AGAINST AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:21.941
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE A VERY

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:26.079
HIGH COST HOUSING UNIT VERSUS A-

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:29.349
STUDIO APARTMENT OR A LOWER

01:56:29.415 --> 01:56:34.354
COST UNIT. IT IS IT PER

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:38.324
PREVALENT AT THE USE A VALUE OR

01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:41.127
A PER UNIT PROCESS TO DETERMINE

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:43.896
THE FEES. YEAH UNDERSCORE SAY

01:56:43.963 --> 01:56:45.598
YES ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING FOR

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.900
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEES

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:48.668
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING ABOUT

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:51.471
IMPACT FEES GENERALLY. WELL I

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:53.005
SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:54.006
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I'M

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:57.443
ALSO- WANNA KNOW GENERALLY IS

01:56:57.510 --> 01:57:00.313
THE PRACTICE TO USE THE VALUE

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.349
OR IS IT APPROVED- OUTDOORS IS

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:04.751
THE FEE BASED ON THE VALUE OF

01:57:04.817 --> 01:57:07.520
THE PROPERTY. OR ISN'T BASED ON.

01:57:07.587 --> 01:57:10.523
YEAH LIKE A BUILDING PERMIT IS

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:12.825
BASED ON VALUE RIGHT BUT YOU

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:13.960
GET A BUILDING PERMIT HOW MUCH

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.895
IS YOUR PROPERTY HOW MUCH IS

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:17.530
THE CONSTRUCTION COST YOU GET

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:19.899
IT YOU GIVE YOU PAY BUILDING

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:23.469
PERMIT. ON THE VALUE OF. OF THE

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:25.505
CONSTRUCTION. IN THEORY THE

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:27.407
IMPACT FEE IT SHOULD BE MORE

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:29.642
TIED TO THE IMPACT OF SO

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:31.277
THERE'S A GOOD LOGIC FOR

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.679
CHARGING MORE FOR LARGER

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:36.816
DEVELOPMENTS- AIMED AT WHAT

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.651
PERSON JUST CITIES I DON'T KNOW

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:39.886
THE PERCENTAGE I MEAN I COULD

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:43.890
LOOK FOR THE CITIES THAT I HAVE

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:44.624
DATA POOR BUT IT'S PRETTY. IT'S

01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:45.425
BETWEEN THE TWO BOTH AND YOU

01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:48.661
SEE BOTH THE- PRETTY COMMON BUT

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:50.897
THERE'S NO- HAVE HAVE

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:53.499
COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHED A-

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:56.769
DISCOUNTING OR- A PROCESS TO

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.439
WAIVE FEES FOR VERY LOW INCOME

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.874
HOUSING THAT THAT IS RELATIVELY

01:58:01.941 --> 01:58:04.043
COMMON IT'S EITHER COMMON IN

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.211
PRACTICE THAT THEY DO IT OR

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:08.147
SOME OF THEM HAVE IT EXPLICIT

01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:09.282
IN THE CODE. OKAY THANK YOU. IF

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:12.518
I MAY ADD TO THAT- WE HAD WITH

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:13.586
THE THREE DIFFERENT LAND USES

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:15.321
STORIES THAT WE'VE COME UPON

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:17.356
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS OBVIOUSLY

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:18.257
DISCUSSION THERE BUT THIS

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:19.959
HASN'T COME ACROSS THE BOARD WE

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:22.228
DID HAVE. SOME HOUSING THAT

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:24.163
CAME ACROSS WITHIN THE DISTRICT

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:25.998
IN THOSE PARK FEES WERE NOT

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:27.733
WAVE JUST BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.836
OF DENSITY TO. RECREATION PARK

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:32.672
SERVICES SO IT IS A FOUR FEET

01:58:32.738 --> 01:58:34.440
WITH LARGE DISTRICTS. OVER THE

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:37.276
QUEEN BEE FEE IS DONE THE VALUE

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:39.645
OF THE LEFT HAND AND THEN HOW

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:40.580
MANY PERSONS PER HOUSE THERE IS

01:58:40.646 --> 01:58:43.850
A FOR WHAT THE DEAL. IS A

01:58:43.916 --> 01:58:46.686
FORMULA THAT INTO PLAY. RIGHT

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:48.521
NOW HE SAID I. THREE PEOPLE PER

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:51.057
CALL SO WHEN YOU AT THOSE IS

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:52.058
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SO AND

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:53.392
WHEN YOU WHEN WE'RE TALKING

01:58:53.459 --> 01:58:56.162
ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING-

01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:58.798
PROBLEM THAT WE DO HAVE WE'RE

01:58:58.865 --> 01:58:59.765
STILL TRYING TO INCREASE

01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:02.335
DENSITY WITH THESE IT IT WITHIN

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:02.902
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND GET

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:05.004
PEOPLE INTO HOUSING BUT IT ALSO

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:07.840
DOES TAX SERVICES THAT WE HAVE.

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:10.843
TO USE  THREE POINT ONE. YOU

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:12.612
YOU YOU FOR ANY HOUSING PROJECT

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:14.647
ANY BROWSING CORRECT IF I BUILD

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:21.087
A BUNCH OF STUDIO UNITS FOR.

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:22.855
SOON TO BE HOMELESS EOPLE

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:24.590
WHICH MAYBE BE WATER AT THE

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:27.093
MOST TO PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO.

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:29.762
THAT WOULD PER PERSON BE A TAX

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:31.964
IT WOULD BE HIGHER PER PERSON

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:33.699
THAN THAN THE OTHERS IN THAT

01:59:33.766 --> 01:59:35.201
WOULD ONLY BE RELEVANT FOR THE

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:37.370
QUEEN BEE AT THE PARK

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:38.504
DEVELOPMENT FEE EXCEPT HER

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:41.607
UNITS. NINE UNITS BASICS THE

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:43.676
QUEEN BEE ACT IS BASED ON THE

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:44.310
FORMULA WITHIN OUR

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:46.612
JURISDICTIONS OF THREE POINT

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.014
ONE. PER HOUSEHOLD AND TWO

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.850
POINT FIVE ACRES PER THOUSAND.

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:52.818
YES OKAY I THINK I THINK THIS

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:54.487
JUMBLE NEEDS TO BE KIND OF

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.522
LOOKED AT TERMS OF. DOES IT

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:57.823
DISCRIMINATE OR NOT

01:59:57.890 --> 02:00:00.726
DISCRIMINATE ON. AFFORDABLE

UNITS YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD TO

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:16.576
SAY THE- PROVIDE RESPONSE TO

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:18.744
THE GOVERNOR'S DEMAND THAT WE

02:00:18.811 --> 02:00:19.612
ELIMINATE HOMELESS IN

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:21.480
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. HELLO

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:23.115
THE UNITS ARE GONNA BE OCCUPIED

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:26.018
BY SINGLE PEOPLE. MAYBE TWO

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:28.554
PEOPLE WITH MOSTLY ONE PERSON

02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:30.523
BUT THEY'RE CHARGED BASED ON.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:33.392
THE STANDARD FEE WHICH IS SHOWS

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:35.127
THAT YOU HAVE THREE OR MORE

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:37.563
PEOPLE IN THE- SO I THINK I

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:40.266
THINK THAT TO BE LOOKED AT. SEC

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:44.203
SKINNER. THANK YOU AND-

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:46.472
APPRECIATE SENATOR BILLS-

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:48.574
QUESTIONS IN THE CLARIFICATION

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:52.011
AROUND WHETHER IT'S THE UNIT OR

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.479
THE NUMBER THE VALUE OF THE

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:55.114
UNIT OR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.482
MIGHT OCCUPIED UNIT BECAUSE

02:00:56.549 --> 02:01:00.553
CLEARLY THIS REALLY IMPACTS THE

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.154
ULTIMATE COST OF THE UNIT AND

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:04.490
THUS THE AFFORDABILITY OF IT.

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:06.993
AND THIS IS ONE OF THESE. WE'RE

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:12.765
IN A. WE JUST HAVE THESE KIND

02:01:12.832 --> 02:01:15.835
OF PERVERSE. PROGRAMS IN IN A

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:18.204
FUNNY WAY IN THAT YES BECAUSE

02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:20.006
OF PROP THIRTEEN AND OTHER

02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:21.641
ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:23.743
FUNDING COMING INTO OUR LOCAL

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:25.711
GOVERNMENTS TO COVER. A LOT OF

02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:27.613
THE BASIC SERVICES THAT ARE

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:31.684
RESIDENTS EXPECT IN YET WE ALSO

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:34.487
HAVE A- NEARLY CRITICAL HOUSING

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.721
SHORTAGE IN IT IS NOT ONLY

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:36.956
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT IS

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:39.592
HOUSING GENERAL AND WE HAVE OUT

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:41.927
MIGRATION NOW. IN THE BAY AREA

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:43.596
FOR SURE I HAVEN'T LOOKED QUITE

02:01:43.663 --> 02:01:46.732
AT THE NUMBERS IN CASH LA AREA

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:48.834
BUT LA IS NOW. JUMP TO THE BAY

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:51.804
AREA IN TERMS THE- RISING COST

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:53.673
OF HOUSING WE WERE THE WORST

02:01:53.739 --> 02:01:55.274
MEANING THE BAY AREA AND NOW

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:58.477
ELOISE JUMPED US SO IN THAT IN

02:01:58.544 --> 02:02:01.013
THE OTHER IRONY OF THIS IS THAT

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.716
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THE

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:06.519
SERVICES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:07.753
FIND TO DO THESE IMPACT FEES

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:10.723
CANNOT LIVE. COMMUNITIES THAT

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:13.025
THEIR BODY THIS SERVICE SO OUR

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:15.261
TEACHERS PUBLIC KEY PERSONNEL

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:18.364
MANY OUR ANYWAY SO WE WERE JUST

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:21.567
IN THIS- CRAZY CRAZY SITUATION.

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:25.905
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE-

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:28.140
THEY NEED TO FIND THE SERVICES

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:30.710
I WONDER IF. OUR LOCAL

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:32.778
GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE WILLING TO

02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:34.714
CONSIDER A MORATORIUM ON FEES

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.182
FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:39.418
FOR EXAMPLE FIVE YEARS- ON MY

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:41.954
BILL LAST YEAR WAS LOOK LOOKING

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.422
AT TRYING TO GIVE A GREEN LIGHT

02:02:43.489 --> 02:02:44.924
TO THE HOUSING THAT ARE

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:46.392
JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY SAID

02:02:46.459 --> 02:02:48.394
YES TO SO IT'S ALREADY APPROVED

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:50.396
IMPLANTS DOESN'T EVEN NEED. YOU

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:53.165
KNOW EXTRA CHANGES IN ZONING

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:55.634
RULES OR OTHER RULES AND I

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.103
INCLUDED IN THAT AND WHAT'S FOR

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:58.471
ONLY A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME

02:02:58.537 --> 02:03:03.109
FIRST TIME. TO DEAL WITH THIS

02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:05.878
CRISIS AND I THINK NOT ONLY A

02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:08.614
WERE MORE TOWARD ON JUST SO WE

02:03:08.681 --> 02:03:10.483
COULD DEALS A LITTLE BIT WITH

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:11.917
THIS CRISIS AND COURSE THAT GOT

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:14.153
TAKEN OUT THE BILL. SO NOW THE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.655
GREEN LIGHT BUT WE KNOW THAT

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:18.591
SOME PROJECTS ARE NOT MOVING

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:27.399
FORWARD JUST AS THE OF. SO HI

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:30.402
NOW. AT THE END. IT JUST

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:32.471
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THE DEFENSE.

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.573
NO BUT BE ABLE. AFFORD THE HOW

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.009
ONCE COUPLE SO REGION IN THIS

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:38.811
REALLY TRICKY SO OUR VOTERS OF

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:40.946
COURSE WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:43.516
THE OPPORTUNITY TO YOU KNOW

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:45.317
HAVE JUST MADE TO PROP THIRTEEN

02:03:45.384 --> 02:03:46.952
IF THEY SO CHOOSE IN NOVEMBER

02:03:47.019 --> 02:03:49.555

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:53.192
PICTURE FOR OUR LOCAL SERVICES-

02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:55.728
BUT I THINK OUR NEED TO ACT

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:58.330
AROUND THE ICING HOUSING CRISIS

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:00.533

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:05.437
HAS COMMON EVEN. ATTEMPTS

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.307
CAPPER MORE TO ON THE CITY'S.

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.142
US BECAUSE FOR THE FIRE

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.978
DISTRICTS AND IN CONTRA CSTA

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.713
COUNTY THERE ARE TWO FIRE

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:17.783
DISTRICTS THAT ARE. OF A BASED

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.985
ON THE PROP THIRTEEN OUR WAY

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:23.789

OF THAT ONE PERSON THAT GOES TO

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:28.394
FIRING CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IS A

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.162
PROXIMITY ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:31.330
TO THE DOLLAR. AND I'VE TO

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:33.432
AGENCIES WHERE ONE IS SIX CENTS

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:35.901
ON SEVEN AND ONE OF THOSE

02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:39.171
AREAS- PASSING UP PARTIAL TAX.

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:40.139
IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE HE'S

02:04:40.206 --> 02:04:42.541
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THEY'RE

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.977
VERY CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE BUT

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:47.913
HE IS WHERE WE'RE DRIVING AND

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:52.017
RIDING ON- ENGINES AT- YOU KNOW

WAY OVERDUE FOR EXCHANGE WITH

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:57.723
THE FIRE STATIONS THAT ARE

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:58.757
FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD JUST

02:04:58.824 --> 02:05:01.293

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.462
NOT HAVE IT. THE FEES AND BEING

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:04.663
ABLE TO PASS ANY KIND OF

02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:09.702
MEASURE TO- DIGITALFUNDING I

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.370
THINK A CAP ON THE FEES OR

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:12.471
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:15.541
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. DEPENDING

02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:22.414
ON THE AGENCY. RIGHT NOW THOSE-

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:23.515
THE QUEEN BEE FEES THAT WE GET

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:24.583
IN AND THE PARK DEVELOPMENT

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:27.119
FEES FOR US ARE THE ONLY

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:28.921
REVENUE THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:31.790
GRANTS FOR PARK DEVELOPMENT AND

TOUCH ON MAINTENANCE OR

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:35.995
ANYTHING SO THAT WOULD

02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:38.264
COMPLETELY PUT A STOP. TO PARK

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:41.934
DEVELOPMENT. MY EXPERIENCE

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:43.669
WORKING WITH CITIES WHEN THEY

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:45.304
WANT TO INCREASE FEES IS THAT

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:46.372
THE DEVELOPERS THAT ARE REALLY

02:05:46.438 --> 02:05:48.741
UPSET BY IT ARE THE ONES WHO

ACOSTA USING THEIR OTHER COSTS

02:05:58.984 --> 02:05:59.919
IF THEY HAVE AN UNEXPECTED

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:02.588
COST. THAT'S REALLY GOING TO

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:04.657

THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:20.392
TO AID BUT I WOULD JUST FROM MY

02:08:20.459 --> 02:08:22.194

REALLY HIGH FEES DO YOU THINK

02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:31.570
IT'S A PROBLEM DO YOU THINK THE

IS IMPACT FEES BUT- IN I THINK.

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:43.916
IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WHERE I DO

02:08:43.982 --> 02:08:44.683
A LOT OF WORK I WOULD SAY

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:46.685
THERE'S ONE CITY THAT I THINK

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:49.188
IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN. BUT

02:08:49.254 --> 02:08:51.190
IT'S ONE OF TWENTY ONE SO I

02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:53.625
THINK IT'S NOT THE CAN IT'S

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:54.960
LIKE IN THE LIST OF CONCERNS

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:56.428
WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE'S A WAY

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:58.464
TO TAILOR IT TO THOSE THOSE

02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:00.732
MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. LISTA

CITY'S WANT TO BUILD A HOUSING.

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:19.151

THE KEY FOR A THIS I'M SO WE'LL

02:25:42.967 --> 02:25:44.068

EFFECT ON THIS HOUSING AND SO

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:52.510
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT WELL

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:53.945
GONNA BE LOOKING FOR HOW DO WE

02:25:54.011 --> 02:26:01.552

MORNING HONORABLE MEMBERS I'M

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:17.935
TOM PACE INTERIM DIRECTOR OF

02:26:18.002 --> 02:26:19.704
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:21.572
CITY OF SACRAMENTO. I AM

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:22.940
PLEASED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

02:26:23.007 --> 02:26:23.407
TO YOU FROM THE CITY'S

02:26:23.474 --> 02:26:26.277
PERSPECTIVE. BY WAY OF CONTEXT

02:26:26.344 --> 02:26:26.944
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:28.346
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:30.648
BETWEEN GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT

02:26:30.715 --> 02:26:33.451
AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT. AND THE

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:34.552
IMPLICATIONS THESE DIFFERENCES

02:26:34.619 --> 02:26:36.687
HAVE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE

02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:38.222
HISTORICALLY SACRAMENTO HAD

02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:40.124
GROWN OUTWARD BY ADDING NEW

02:26:40.191 --> 02:26:42.727
SUBDIVISIONS ON GREENFIELD

02:26:42.793 --> 02:26:44.695
LANDS SUCH AS FORMER FARMLAND.

02:26:44.762 --> 02:26:45.963
IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE

02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:47.565
CITY ADOPTED A NEW GENERAL PLAN

02:26:47.632 --> 02:26:49.500
THAT SAID A MAJOR OBJECTIVE TO

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:50.301
GROW INWARD RATHER THAN

02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:52.336
OUTWARD. MAJOR NEW DEVELOPMENT

02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:53.404
AREAS WERE NOT ADDED TO THE

02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:55.840
PLAN. THIS MEANT THAT MOST NEW

02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:56.641
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE

02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:57.475
ACCOMMODATED WITHIN THE

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.076
EXISTING CITY LIMITS AND IN

02:26:59.143 --> 02:27:00.678
AREAS THAT HAD LONG BEEN

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:02.346
PLANNED FOR DEVELOPMENT. OVER

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:04.248
THE PAST TEN YEARS SACRAMENTO

02:27:04.315 --> 02:27:06.784
HAS SEEN INCREASING INFILL

02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:07.852
DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE CENTRAL

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:09.787
CITY. AND IN OTHER OLDER

02:27:09.854 --> 02:27:11.822
NEIGHBORHOODS. I MENTION THIS

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:12.557
BECAUSE PROVIDING NEW

02:27:12.623 --> 02:27:14.158
INFRASTRUCTURE IN GREENFIELD

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:15.993
AREAS IS STRAIGHT FORWARD.

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:17.261
SINCE THERE IS LITTLE EXISTING

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:19.197
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE DEVELOPER

02:27:19.263 --> 02:27:20.998
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY ALL

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:23.134
IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.735
IN IN FILLED AREAS THERE IS

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:26.037
USUALLY A MIXTURE OF VACANT

02:27:26.103 --> 02:27:27.805
LAND AND DEVELOP LAND WITH SOME

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.473
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. IN

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:30.708
THESE AREASTHE CITY AND

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:32.510
DEVELOPERS MUST ASSESS THE

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:34.145
ADEQUACY OF THE EXISTING

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:36.113
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT NEW

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:38.149
INFILL DEVELOPMENT. IN SOME

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:39.784
CASES THIS THING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:42.520
IS ALREADY DEFICIENT AND CANNOT

02:27:42.587 --> 02:27:44.689
SUPPORT NEW DEVELOPMENTS. IN

02:27:44.755 --> 02:27:46.591
OTHER CASES THE EXISTING

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:47.225
INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE EXCESS

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:48.559
CAPACITY SO THAT NEW

02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:50.494
DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:52.763
WITH MINIMAL COST. TO SUPPORT

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:54.498
OUR INFILL POLICY OBJECTIVES

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.133
AND RECOGNIZING THAT INFILL

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:57.735
DEVELOPMENT IS CHALLENGING

02:27:57.802 --> 02:27:59.437
SACRAMENTO HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS

02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:01.005
ABOUT INCREASING DEVELOPMENT

02:28:01.072 --> 02:28:03.241
IMPACT FEES. BEFORE WE WERE

02:28:03.307 --> 02:28:05.309
AMEND ANY NEW FEES OR INCREASES

TO EXISTING FEES WE ASSESS THE

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:08.679
MARKET FEASIBILITY OF DIFFERENT

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:10.648
DEVELOPMENT TYPES WITH AND

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:13.117
WITHOUT ANY PROPOSED FEE. WE

02:28:13.184 --> 02:28:14.352
ALSO REVIEW REGIONAL

02:28:14.418 --> 02:28:16.487
COMPARISONS WITH OTHER AGENCIES

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.856
BEFORE SETTING FEES. TO SUPPORT

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:21.425
OUR POLICY OBJECTIVES WE HAVE

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:21.826
MADE THE FOLLOWING

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.661
IMPROVEMENTS. WE EXEMPT

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:39.810
PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:41.912
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.281
IT MEANS LESS UP FRONT CAPITAL

IS REQUIRED TO GET A BUILDING

02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:46.817

CALCULATE MOST FEES ON A PER

INCREASE IN INFILL DEVELOPMENT.

CONSTRUCTION COSTS RISING WHICH

02:30:23.814 --> 02:30:25.349
MAKES MANY KINDS OF DEVELOPMENT

02:30:25.416 --> 02:30:27.818
IN FEASIBLE. WE ARE CHALLENGED

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:29.120
TO FIND WAYS TO BACK FILL OUR

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:31.088
GENEROUS FEE REDUCTIONS. IT'S

02:30:31.155 --> 02:30:32.923
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.758
THOSE FEES WERE ESTABLISHED TO

02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:36.026
PAY FOR NECESSARY FACILITIES IN

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:39.797
ARE BIRDS REDUCE THE CITY'S

02:30:39.864 --> 02:30:41.465
ABILITIES TO FIND THEM. THE

02:30:41.532 --> 02:30:42.800
CITY DOESN'T COURAGE THE STATE

02:30:42.867 --> 02:30:44.435
TO LOOK AT WAYS TO INCREASE

02:30:44.502 --> 02:30:46.570
LOCAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:47.805

THAT ALIGNS INCENTIVES TO THE

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:20.037
OUTCOMES THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE

STATE WHEN OUR CHIEF I'M SO

02:31:22.039 --> 02:31:23.908

WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN YOU STARTED

I'D LIKE. SUGGEST ONE THING

02:31:40.491 --> 02:31:41.792

SURROUNDED BY FREEWAYS WHICH

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:49.867
OUR STATE FACILITIES. I WOULD

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:52.203
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO

02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:54.738
STOP ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:31:54.805 --> 02:31:57.308
AND NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO

COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

02:32:04.715 --> 02:32:06.717
NEW DEVELOPMENTS ADJACENT TO

STAY FREEWAYS AND ASKING THAT

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:11.188
THESE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS PAY.

02:32:11.255 --> 02:32:13.090
SOMETHING OR UNDER TWO STUDIES

02:32:13.157 --> 02:32:16.060
TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE IMPACT IS

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:17.394
AND THEN WHICH IS COURSES. IN

02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:18.762
SOME CASES AND THEN THAT TAKES

02:32:18.829 --> 02:32:22.399
TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND

02:32:22.466 --> 02:32:23.133
THEN IMPOSE A FEE. CARD OR JUST

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.603
ACTION ON THE DEVELOPER. TO FIX

02:32:25.669 --> 02:32:27.505
THE STATE'S FREEWAY SO IT'S A

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:28.606
STATE FACILITY NOT A LOCAL

02:32:28.672 --> 02:32:30.508
FACILITY BE GREAT IF THE STATE

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:32.810
WOULD FIX THE STATE FACILITIES

02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:34.712
AND NOT BURDEN LOCAL AREAS WITH

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:38.215
THAT. AND IT WHEN IT. IS

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:39.950
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL FEES ARE

02:32:40.017 --> 02:32:40.951
LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE

02:32:41.018 --> 02:32:42.953
STATE- THE STATE COULD

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.488
DETERMINE YOU KNOW OTHER WAYS

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:46.957
TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF OUR

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:49.460

CONTROLLED BY THE STATE. I'LL

02:32:53.531 --> 02:32:56.133
JUST ADD THE- FUNDING I THINK

MAKE THAT MORE ACHIEVABLE SO

02:33:03.274 --> 02:33:03.807
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

02:33:03.874 --> 02:33:05.342

BEING CANDID. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:36:14.131 --> 02:36:15.299
OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING

02:36:15.365 --> 02:36:16.500
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO

02:36:16.567 --> 02:36:18.435
PENCIL IN A PROJECT LIKE LABOR

02:36:18.502 --> 02:36:20.304

PANELISTS PLEASE. SURE AT SOME

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.115
OF A QUICK- THAT THE THIS ISSUE

02:36:31.181 --> 02:36:33.283
I ATTENDED JOKE THAT WE WERE WE

02:36:33.350 --> 02:36:34.518
TRIED TO CALL THE DEVELOPERS

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:35.686
BLUFF IS A WHAT WHAT REALLY IS

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:36.987
THE ISSUE AND I THINK WE TRY TO

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:38.188
ADDRESS EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS

02:36:38.255 --> 02:36:39.590
BROUGHT UP- ONE WAY THE OTHER

02:36:39.656 --> 02:36:41.992
TO THAT LIST- WE FIND THAT IT

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:42.993
DOES COME DOWN.DEPEND THE

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:44.027
BOTTOM LINE PENCILING IN THE

02:36:44.094 --> 02:36:46.263
MARGIN OF CHICAGO AND LABOR

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:48.465

THE CASA EXTRACTIONS ARE

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:51.835
DISCOVERS. AND BECAUSE- BUT WE

DON'T DON'T MAKE SENSE- THEN

02:36:54.738 --> 02:36:56.707
THEN IT COMES TO- DOWN TO THE

02:36:56.774 --> 02:36:57.908
FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

02:36:57.975 --> 02:36:59.143
OF HOUSING OR DOWNTOWN WE'RE

02:36:59.209 --> 02:37:00.410
TRYING TO. CREATE THIS IS A NEW

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:01.879
PRODUCT THAT OUR CITY DOESN'T

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:02.880
HAVE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:04.882
IN THE BAY AREA WE NEED START

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:06.283
ACTING LIKE TO. START TO BRING

02:37:06.350 --> 02:37:07.184
THAT TO SEE TOWARD DOWNTOWN-

02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:09.086
IT'S- SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:10.554
NERVOUS TO BE THE FIRST ONE OR

02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:11.688
TWO TO GO AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:37:11.755 --> 02:37:13.724
LOOKING FOR THAT FIRST PUSHED

02:37:13.791 --> 02:37:14.625
ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:15.492
NOW WE'RE- WE'RE LOOKING. MONEY

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:16.760
TO WE'VE- REASON EVERY NOW. ON

02:37:16.827 --> 02:37:18.028
A PRICE DISTRICT IN. PLACE TO

02:37:18.095 --> 02:37:21.131
TRY TO. ACT MONEY TO REGION. TO

02:37:21.198 --> 02:37:21.765
TRY TO GET SOMETHING BILL. YOU

02:37:21.832 --> 02:37:23.700
TO PLEASE. IF I MAY. AT TO

02:37:23.767 --> 02:37:24.802
THAT'S FOR THE COUNTY IT'S A

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:26.069
LITTLE DIFFERENT- OBVIOUSLY

02:37:26.136 --> 02:37:27.938
OUR- URBAN CENTERS AND MORE IN

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:29.740
THE CITIES BUT- WE ARE PLANNING

02:37:29.807 --> 02:37:31.074
AHEAD AND WE ARE LOOKING AT

02:37:31.141 --> 02:37:32.509
AREAS THAT WILL. ORGANIZE OVER

02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:34.178
TIME AND RIVER SEXUALITY. AND

02:37:34.244 --> 02:37:36.380
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND- AND I AND

02:37:36.446 --> 02:37:38.015
I. REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:39.049
RENO TARGETS BECAUSE I THINK

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:40.384
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:41.618
DISCUSSION FOR ALL OF YOU TO

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:43.387
CONSIDER. FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY

02:37:43.453 --> 02:37:44.788
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A- TARGET

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:46.690
OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND UNITS.

02:37:46.757 --> 02:37:48.425
I THINK WE'RE SECOND HIGHEST.

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:50.661
IN THIS GUIDE REGION TO THE-

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:53.797
LOS. ANGELES AND- I MORE. THAN

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:54.331
OUR OTHER COUNTY. SOUTHERN

02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:57.234
CALIFORNIA. SO ACTUALLY. GONE

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:58.669
OUT OF HIM EMPOWER. GOALS

02:37:58.735 --> 02:37:59.536
WE'VE- WE'VE- THE LAND.

02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:01.672
PROVIDED THAT. HIRED THE HOUSE.

02:38:01.738 --> 02:38:05.108
SO THE ZONING IS NOT. THE ISSUE

02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:07.811
SO MUCH AS THE CALL. BRING TO.

02:38:07.878 --> 02:38:13.016
AREAS OF THE- I WOULD OFFER AS

02:38:13.083 --> 02:38:14.084
ARE WE ACTUALLY MOVED NEEDLE

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:14.751
SEE THE HOUSING BUILT AS HOW DO

02:38:14.818 --> 02:38:16.787
WE HOW DO WE ALIGN ST FUNDING

02:38:16.854 --> 02:38:17.888
PRIORITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:19.590
WITH RENO TARGETS SO THAT THE

02:38:19.656 --> 02:38:20.958
AGENCIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:22.860
HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:38:22.926 --> 02:38:24.728
GROWTH HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE

02:38:24.795 --> 02:38:26.230
ABLE TO DELIVER THAT. IN

02:38:26.296 --> 02:38:27.865
ADDITION TO IN JUST KLAY AT

02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:29.299
GERMANY AT THIRTY SECONDS OR

02:38:29.366 --> 02:38:30.567
LESS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE

02:38:30.634 --> 02:38:32.836
HAVE A LST PANEL. STRATEGY TO

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:35.005
BE AT THE BACK FILL. FACILITIES

02:38:35.072 --> 02:38:36.707
THAT MAY HAVE TO BE DEFERRED.

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:38.175
BASED OFF OF EITHER DEFERRALS

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:41.211
OR CAP ANY FEES AT THIRTY

02:38:41.278 --> 02:38:42.512
SECONDS OR LESS FROM EACH YEAR.

02:38:42.579 --> 02:38:44.314
SO I MENTION ONE BE CENTRALLY

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:47.251
LOWERED OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR

02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:48.585
THE KIND OF FACILITIES THAT WE

02:38:48.652 --> 02:38:50.220
WANT TO HAVE. SO THERE ARE

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:51.054
CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:52.856
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTH

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:55.125
AND SAFETY WATER SEWER DRAINAGE

02:53:03.339 --> 02:53:06.743
HOUSING FINANCING AND ALSO WELL

02:53:06.809 --> 02:53:07.610
VERSED ON HOW DIFFERENT COST.

02:53:07.677 --> 02:53:08.945
ERRORS OF FACT FINANCIAL

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:11.314
FEASIBILITY. IT TO PROVIDE SOME

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:13.683
CONTEXT TODAY WITH REGARD TO

02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:14.650
THE INTERSECTION OF IMPACT FEES

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:16.753
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FIRST

02:53:16.819 --> 02:53:18.721
IRATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:53:18.788 --> 02:53:21.124
DEVELOPMENT WE PUT TOGETHER A

02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:23.659
CASE STUDY WHICH IS BEFORE YOU

02:53:23.726 --> 02:53:27.363
WHEN IS DISPLAYED ON OKAY. WHAT

02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:29.766
WE DID. FOR AFFORDABLE. JACK

02:53:29.832 --> 02:53:31.400
OUR EITHER COMPLETE OR IN THE

02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:33.803
PROCESS OF RECEIVING FUNDING TO

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.304
TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THE

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:37.340
CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPACT FEES

02:53:37.406 --> 02:53:40.343
AND TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST- I

02:53:40.409 --> 02:53:43.880
WILL NOTE THAT- THREE OF THE

02:53:43.946 --> 02:53:44.781
PROJECTS ARE NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:53:44.847 --> 02:53:46.249
WHICH INCLUDES THE FIRST

02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:48.351
PROJECT WHICH TO MANCHESTER AND

02:53:48.417 --> 02:53:49.685
IT'S LOCATED IN ANAHEIM.

02:53:49.752 --> 02:53:51.420
GATEWAY WHICH IS IN SACRAMENTO

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:54.557
JUST ACROSS THE- TOWER BRIDGE

02:53:54.624 --> 02:53:56.559
AND SUNRISE POINT WHICH IS OUT

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:59.395
IN CITRUS HEIGHTS WHICH IS THAT

02:53:59.462 --> 02:54:00.830
I NORTHERN INCORPORATED IN THE

02:54:00.897 --> 02:54:01.831
COUNT SACRAMENTO I ALSO

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:03.833
INCLUDED- A PROJECT CALLED THE

02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:05.902
AKON A LARGE WHICH IS DOWN IN

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:07.937
ANAHEIM IT'S AN ADAPTER USE

02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:11.307
PROJECT AND I THINK THIS IS

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:12.508
SOMETHING THAT IS OUT YOU KNOW

02:54:12.575 --> 02:54:14.944
KIND INTERESTING TO TAKE. OUT

02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:19.916
AS A FORT AND. THE FATE. THING

02:54:19.982 --> 02:54:22.084
WE- EXPENSIVE PRICES THEY'VE

02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:22.985
TURNED TO. UNDER UTILIZED

02:54:23.052 --> 02:54:23.953
PIECES OF PROPERTY TO TRANSFORM

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:26.255
THEM INTO HOUSING AND YET THESE

02:54:26.322 --> 02:54:27.824
DEVELOPMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

02:54:27.890 --> 02:54:30.860
IMPACT FEES AS WELL- AS NEW

02:54:30.927 --> 02:54:32.361
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE. AND

02:54:32.428 --> 02:54:33.863
DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:36.499
DEVELOPMENT- IMPACT THE FEE

02:54:36.566 --> 02:54:38.935
STRUCTURE BUT IT'S AN

02:54:39.001 --> 02:54:39.502
INTERESTING STOCK TO TAKE A

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:42.972
LOOK AT. GIVEN THAT I AM FROM

02:54:43.039 --> 02:54:44.607
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I HAD SOME

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.576
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF HOW WHO

02:54:46.642 --> 02:54:48.611
WOULD HAVE HIGHER IMPACT FEES

02:54:48.678 --> 02:54:51.080
AND I WAS SURPRISED- TO

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:53.115
DISCOVER THAT REALLY THE

02:54:53.182 --> 02:54:55.084
SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND THAT

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:56.686
PROJECT AND STRESSED HEIGHTS

02:54:56.752 --> 02:54:58.054
HAS THE HIGHEST BE LOAD

02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.956
PROXIMALLY TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

02:55:00.022 --> 02:55:02.725
DOLLARS PER UNIT- AND EAT WHICH

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:04.660
IS LESS THAN THE ORANGE COUNTY

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:07.797
ANAHEIM EXAMPLE I WILL NOTE

02:55:07.864 --> 02:55:09.932
THAT THE ADAPTIVE RE USE THAN

02:55:09.999 --> 02:55:11.667
IT HAD IT'S A PERMANENT SO

02:55:11.734 --> 02:55:16.772
HOUSE JACK AND DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:20.209
SAME ACT ON RULES THAT LIKE. MY

02:55:20.276 --> 02:55:24.480
PROJECT HOW. BUT MOST. FULL AND

02:55:24.547 --> 02:55:27.083
HER OUT IMPACT FEES ARE PER YOU.

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:27.917
I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE TOW

02:55:27.984 --> 02:55:30.119
PER. OF IMPACT FEES AS A

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:31.687
PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEVELOPMENT

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:34.023
COST RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE

02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:36.726
PERCENT- AND I YOU KNOW I THINK

02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:38.861
YOU HEARD DAVE'S- COMMENTS HE

02:55:38.928 --> 02:55:40.029
WAS TALKING MOSTLY ABOUT THE

02:55:40.096 --> 02:55:41.697
BAY AREA OF HIGHER FEE

02:55:41.764 --> 02:55:43.633
STRUCTURES I THINK WHAT YOU'LL

02:55:43.699 --> 02:55:46.469
FIND- IS THAT FEE STRUCTURE.

02:55:46.535 --> 02:55:47.036
VERY DIFFERENT AND ARE VERY

02:55:47.103 --> 02:55:50.172
JURIST SPECIFIC YOU LEARN A LOT

02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:51.874
ABOUT WHAT A JURISDICTION VAL

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:53.809
WAS AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN

02:55:53.876 --> 02:55:55.745
FUNDING BY THEIR FEE STRUCTURE.

02:55:55.811 --> 02:55:57.847
AND AGAIN IT'S REALLY RENTS AND

02:55:57.914 --> 02:56:00.016
IT'S AN IN ON WHERE YOU ARE AND

02:56:00.082 --> 02:56:02.084
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF UNIT.

02:56:02.151 --> 02:56:04.453
THESE PROJECTS ALSO ARE ALL

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.055
INFILL PROJECTS THEY ARE NOT

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:08.891
GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT SO THAT

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:13.129
ALSO HAS ITS IMPACT THE TOTAL

02:56:13.195 --> 02:56:15.097
FEE STRUCTURE. ALL IMPACT IS

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:16.165
DON'T ACCOUNT FOR MUCH. OF THE-

02:56:16.232 --> 02:56:17.767
TOTAL PROJECT. AS YOU'VE HEARD

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:20.970
FROM OTHERS- IMPACT FEES AND

02:56:21.037 --> 02:56:23.005
LAND COSTS ARE ONE OF THE TWO

02:56:23.072 --> 02:56:25.107
OF THE FACTORS THAT DEVELOPERS

02:56:25.174 --> 02:56:26.242
HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF CONTROL

02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:28.711
OVER. CONSTRUCTION COSTS- THEY

02:56:28.778 --> 02:56:32.014
DON'T AND TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:32.915
YOU KNOW THE STATE THROUGH

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:34.784
LEGISLATION AND LOCAL JURISTS

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:36.218
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGH

02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:38.521
INNOVATION. CAN FACILITATE OUR

02:56:38.587 --> 02:56:40.790
REDUCE FATE FEES WAIVED FEES

02:56:40.856 --> 02:56:43.192
THE FIRST FOR DEFERRED FEES IT

02:56:43.259 --> 02:56:44.660
REALLY DOES HELP AFFORDABLE

02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:45.561
HAPPENING AND THERE

02:56:45.628 --> 02:56:47.763
AFFORDABILITY. I WILL ALSO NOTE

02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:49.265
THAT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:56:49.332 --> 02:56:50.533
PROJECTS THERE IN A VERY

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:53.135
DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN MARKET

02:56:53.202 --> 02:56:54.470
RATE PROJECT. BECAUSE THE RENTS

02:56:54.537 --> 02:56:57.173
ARE. THEY REALLY CAN'T LEVERAGE

02:56:57.239 --> 02:56:58.841
MORE DEBT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON

02:56:58.908 --> 02:57:03.980
FEDERAL TAX CREDITS FOR THEIR

02:57:04.046 --> 02:57:05.581
EQUITY PORTION. EIGHT ONE HOW

02:57:05.648 --> 02:57:07.450
BILLION LEVERAGE ANY PRETTY AND

02:57:07.516 --> 02:57:08.184
I WILL KNOW AS I'M SURE OF YOU

02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:10.353
KNOW AFFORDABLE PROGRAMS THAT

02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:12.254
ARE RUN BY BOTH THE TAX CREDIT

02:57:12.321 --> 02:57:13.656
ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE

02:57:13.723 --> 02:57:15.224
DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE

02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:18.227
ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED SO ANYTHING

02:57:18.294 --> 02:57:20.062
THAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE

02:57:20.129 --> 02:57:23.199
COST OF HOUSING. ONLY NOT ONLY

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.301
IMPACTS FINANCE FEASIBILITY BUT

02:57:25.368 --> 02:57:27.136
THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE MORE

02:57:27.203 --> 02:57:29.171
UNITS WHICH I KNOW IT.

02:57:29.238 --> 02:57:31.474
GOVERNOR'S A SEVEN REALLY I.

02:57:31.540 --> 02:57:33.109
JACK GIVE THAT THE SHORE THAT

02:57:33.175 --> 02:57:36.479
WE- RIGHT NOW. BUT WITH ALL THE

02:57:36.545 --> 02:57:37.546
SAYS I'M JIM READ ONLY

02:57:37.613 --> 02:57:39.215
UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:57:39.281 --> 02:57:41.317
THAT IMPACT BEAT PLAY ON THE

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:44.653
LOCAL LEVEL. AND I UNDERSTAND

02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:46.122
THAT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE

02:57:46.188 --> 02:57:48.691
DEPENDS ON IMPACT FEES I HAVE A

02:57:48.758 --> 02:57:52.061
COUPLE OF IDEAS- THAT I'D LIKE

02:57:52.128 --> 02:57:53.896
TO DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:56.132
TO CONSIDER. HELP SPUR HELPING

02:57:56.198 --> 02:57:58.134
AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT AND

02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:00.102
POTENTIAL LEVY A SOME OF THE

02:58:00.169 --> 02:58:01.871
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE QUINCES

02:58:01.937 --> 02:58:03.572
OF THE EXISTING PEACE ACTORS

02:58:03.639 --> 02:58:06.042
ONE- IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN

02:58:06.108 --> 02:58:07.510
ARTICULATED TODAY AND IT'S THE

02:58:07.576 --> 02:58:09.345
CONCEPT THAT LOCAL

02:58:09.412 --> 02:58:10.413
JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE.

02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:12.348
REALLY NEED TO START LOOKING AT

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.716
THE STRUCTURE TO TRACK

02:58:13.783 --> 02:58:15.751
INCENTIVIZE. DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:18.754
THEY WANT TO THE CENTURY STATE

02:58:18.821 --> 02:58:20.322
IS ONE GET A LOT. OR WHAT TO

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:22.024
DEVELOP YOU KNOW UNDER UTILIZED

02:58:22.091 --> 02:58:25.261
MOTELS ARE REALLY TO DEVELOP

02:58:25.327 --> 02:58:28.731
EIGHTY YOU UNITS ARE WANT TO

02:58:28.798 --> 02:58:29.331
DEVELOP MIXED IN DEVELOPMENTS

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:32.902
THERE NEED TO WRITE. BACK THE

02:58:32.968 --> 02:58:35.404
STRUCTURE. THIS CONCEPT IT'S

02:58:35.471 --> 02:58:36.038
MORE OF A BROAD BUT WE'VE HER A

02:58:36.105 --> 02:58:37.506
LOT TO THAT YOU KNOW THE NEXUS

02:58:37.573 --> 02:58:38.874
STUDIES THAT ARE DONE TO

02:58:38.941 --> 02:58:40.976
ESTABLISH FEES ARE HAVE A LOT

02:58:41.043 --> 02:58:42.311
OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BASED

02:58:42.378 --> 02:58:44.380
ON YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DATA

02:58:44.447 --> 02:58:47.383
THAT EXISTED- YEARS AGO AND I

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:49.752
THINK ALL REALIZE THAT WERE IN

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:50.986
THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS

02:58:51.053 --> 02:58:53.089
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH U. S. TO

02:58:53.155 --> 02:58:55.691
HOUSE- THE RIGHT BUTTONS THAT

02:58:55.758 --> 02:58:57.426
YEAH THAT RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA

02:58:57.493 --> 02:59:00.563
AND AS A RESULT AND PEOPLE ARE

02:59:00.629 --> 02:59:02.565
SLEEPING UNDER. I'M SAYS THERE

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:04.366
ARE ON THE RIVER BEDS AND THE

02:59:04.433 --> 02:59:05.868
HOMELESS CRISIS IS JUST

02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:08.337
INCREASING GETTING WORSE AND SO

02:59:08.404 --> 02:59:11.273
I THINK THE CONCEPT IS TO RE

02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:13.342
THINK THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:15.778
DEVELOP STRUCTURE TO THE X.

02:59:15.845 --> 02:59:17.980
WHAT A PORTABLE HOUSING

02:59:18.047 --> 02:59:22.685
DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING. IS

02:59:22.751 --> 02:59:25.087
TRYING TO HELP HOMELESS

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:26.589
INDIVIDUALS. STE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:59:26.655 --> 02:59:29.959
THIRTY. ON UNDER IT YEAH SAME

02:59:30.025 --> 02:59:31.026
CAN THAT YOU STICK WITH NEW CAN

02:59:31.093 --> 02:59:33.762
YOU THE SAME AS IT IS AT THE

02:59:33.829 --> 02:59:35.297
SAME TODAY AS IT USED TO BE

02:59:35.364 --> 02:59:36.799
SHOULD HOMELESS PROJECTS REALLY

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:38.334
BE GETTING A CREDIT VERSUS

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.603
BEING CHARGED FOR THE STRAIN

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:42.037
THAT THEY'RE PUTTING ON

02:59:42.104 --> 02:59:43.606
INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS THE KIND

02:59:43.672 --> 02:59:45.407
OF OUTER IDEA TO THINK ABOUT

02:59:45.474 --> 02:59:48.244
THE LAST IDEA AND I THINK I

02:59:48.310 --> 02:59:50.346
DON'T HAVE- EXPERIENCE WORKING

02:59:50.412 --> 02:59:52.815
IN ALL JURISDICTION MY IN

02:59:52.882 --> 02:59:54.583
JURISDICTIONS MY INCLINATION

02:59:54.650 --> 02:59:56.585
IS. MOST RESEARCH TRYING TO DO

02:59:56.652 --> 02:59:57.720
THEIR BEST TO BALANCE BETWEEN

02:59:57.786 --> 02:59:59.622
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND TO

02:59:59.688 --> 03:00:01.957
PRODUCE HOUSING I THINK THEY'RE

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:05.327
LIKELY ARE OUT LIARS THAT ARE

03:00:05.394 --> 03:00:07.930
TRYING TO EITHER DEVELOPMENT OR

03:00:07.997 --> 03:00:11.066
ARE TRYING TO PLAY I FEET.

03:00:11.133 --> 03:00:12.401
DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER COSTS THAT

03:00:12.468 --> 03:00:14.703
IN A- SO SEATED WITH THE TO.

03:00:14.770 --> 03:00:15.704
THE AFFORD HOUSING SITES ONE

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:18.407
IDEA MIGHT BE- FOR THE STATE TO

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:20.643
LOOK AT IMPACT FEES AND TO

03:00:20.709 --> 03:00:22.545
CREATE YOU KNOW PROBLEM EITHER

03:00:22.611 --> 03:00:24.680
REGIONAL OR PROJECT TYPE

03:00:24.747 --> 03:00:27.116
CEILINGS FOR IMPACT FEES AND

03:00:27.183 --> 03:00:29.818
GIVEN THAT MOST- AFFORDABLE

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:32.221
HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE TO MAKE

03:00:32.288 --> 03:00:34.156
A STOP AT THE STATE TO RECEIVE

03:00:34.223 --> 03:00:36.225
STATE RESOURCES. AT CONDITION

03:00:36.292 --> 03:00:38.360
OF THIS SOURCES POTENTIAL IN

03:00:38.427 --> 03:00:42.631

TOPIC THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN

03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:30.279
VERY ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST

03:01:30.346 --> 03:01:31.513
TWO YEARS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'VE

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:34.016
ISSUED. A HANDFUL REPORTS ON

03:01:34.083 --> 03:01:35.751
THIS EXACT TOPIC- THE LATEST OF

03:01:35.818 --> 03:01:38.520
WHICH WAS IN HIS LAST SUMMER

03:01:38.587 --> 03:01:40.122
TWENTY NINETEEN- WHICH WAS DONE

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:42.057
AT THE BEHEST OF THE STATE

03:01:42.124 --> 03:01:43.158

DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT SO. I'M

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:46.161
GONNA TALK. ARE THINGS FROM

03:01:46.228 --> 03:01:49.665
THIS RESEARCH ARM AND ALSO SOME

03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:50.566
OF OUR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND

03:01:50.633 --> 03:01:52.601
CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS WORK AS

03:01:52.668 --> 03:01:54.536
WELL- ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT

03:01:54.603 --> 03:01:55.170
WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER PIECE

03:01:55.237 --> 03:01:57.473
SEARCH. ON HOW THE COUPLE WEEKS

03:01:57.539 --> 03:02:00.376
THAT WILL TAKE THE RESEARCH

03:02:00.442 --> 03:02:03.946
WE'VE DONE AT THIS POINT- EVEN

03:02:04.013 --> 03:02:06.181
A STEP FURTHER STILL. FOR THAT.

03:02:06.248 --> 03:02:08.684
THE BIG. THAT BEEN. I THINK A

03:02:08.751 --> 03:02:09.785
LOT FOLKS TAKE WHEN THEY LOOK.

03:02:09.852 --> 03:02:12.488
THAT IN SOME. NOW ALSO DUE TO

03:02:12.554 --> 03:02:13.689
IN SOME CITY HE'S GONNA UP

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.824
BECAUSE HIGH IN FACT IN OUR

03:02:15.891 --> 03:02:17.793
PORT WE FOUND THAT. IS SINCE IS.

03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:21.897
ON HE PERSON. READY PROJECT

03:02:21.964 --> 03:02:25.100
EXPERIENCES UPWARDS OF A

03:02:25.167 --> 03:02:26.101
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

03:02:26.168 --> 03:02:27.936
YOU. SOMETIMES UNDER. DOLLARS

03:02:28.003 --> 03:02:29.171
UNIT. WE KNOW DEVIOUS.

03:02:29.238 --> 03:02:31.073
LITERATURE THAT. FEES OFTEN

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:34.376
TIME DO YOU. ARE PASSED ON TO

03:02:34.443 --> 03:02:35.944
THE CONSUMER IN THE FORM OF

03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:38.180
HIGHER. RENTS OR HIGHER HOME

03:02:38.247 --> 03:02:40.683
PRICES AND I THINK THEY THEY

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:43.018
THERE IS A COMMON EARLIER THAT

03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:45.487
YOU KNOW IF HE IS OR NOT. INTO

03:02:45.554 --> 03:02:46.422
PLAYING THE TOP. AT THE

03:02:46.488 --> 03:02:51.827
PRESERVING. I NOTE NOT. OF THE

03:02:51.894 --> 03:02:53.128
SAME AND IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN

03:02:53.195 --> 03:02:53.696
EIGHTY OR YOU BUILDING THIS

03:02:53.762 --> 03:02:56.098
MIDDLE HOW THE BILL NUMBERS ARE

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:57.032
ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH FOR. TO

03:02:57.099 --> 03:02:58.967
ABSORB AND IT DOES HAVE A

03:02:59.034 --> 03:03:00.736
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AS YOU GO

03:03:00.803 --> 03:03:02.671
FURTHER DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT

03:03:02.738 --> 03:03:04.573
SCALE SO SMALL UNITS ISIS

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:08.410
THINGS LIKE THAT- ALSO JUST A

03:03:08.477 --> 03:03:09.611
TOTAL NUMBER. HE'S A WEEK. ALSO

03:03:09.678 --> 03:03:11.146
FOUND SIGNIFICAN ISSUES

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:13.048
TRANSPARENCY SO IT IS REALLY

03:03:13.115 --> 03:03:15.284
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FEE

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:17.252
SCHEDULES IN MANY INSTANCES TO

03:03:17.319 --> 03:03:17.986
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE FEW

03:03:18.053 --> 03:03:19.455
SCHEDULE SAY AND HOW THAT

03:03:19.521 --> 03:03:21.256
RELATES. TO YOUR PROJECT AND SO

03:03:21.323 --> 03:03:22.524
AGAIN. IS A BIGGER ISSUE FOR

03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:24.426
SMALLER BUILDERS WHO MAY NOT

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:26.662
HAVE THE RESOURCES OR TIME TO

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:28.797
DIG THROUGH ITS CITY WEBSITE TO

03:03:28.864 --> 03:03:29.732
FIND FEE SCHEDULE AND

03:03:29.798 --> 03:03:32.201
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE

03:03:32.267 --> 03:03:32.801
PROJECT THAT THEY LIKE TO. AND

03:03:32.868 --> 03:03:34.169
ONE OF THE LAST MAJOR FIND.

03:03:34.236 --> 03:03:35.871
THAT WE HAD WAS THAT MOST

03:03:35.938 --> 03:03:37.906
CITIES ARE NOT CONDUCTING

03:03:37.973 --> 03:03:39.174
REALLY ROBUST FEASIBILITY

03:03:39.241 --> 03:03:41.143
ANALYSIS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND

03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:43.245
WHAT THE IMPACT OF THEIR FEES

03:03:43.312 --> 03:03:44.179
WILL BE ON. THE ABILITY OF THE

03:03:44.246 --> 03:03:47.015
MARKET TO DELIVER HOUSING SO-

03:03:47.082 --> 03:03:48.884
MANY CITIES ARE RELYING ON AN

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:50.586
INFORMAL COMMITTEES OR AN

03:03:50.652 --> 03:03:51.920
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THEIR

03:03:51.987 --> 03:03:53.188
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ARE

03:03:53.255 --> 03:03:54.623
CHARGING AS JUSTIFICATION FOR

03:03:54.690 --> 03:03:55.591
SITTING THERE FEES. NEITHER OF

03:03:55.657 --> 03:03:57.292
THESE ARE A BUS ENOUGH TO TAKE

03:03:57.359 --> 03:03:58.694
THE PLACE OF AN ACTUAL FULL

03:03:58.761 --> 03:04:01.096
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS TO REALLY.

03:04:01.163 --> 03:04:02.431
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING

03:04:02.498 --> 03:04:03.699
THE BEES THAT THEY NEED BUT

03:04:03.766 --> 03:04:08.337
ALSO NOT STOPPING. AND SO.

03:04:08.404 --> 03:04:09.204
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND-

03:04:09.271 --> 03:04:10.739
INS FROM RESEARCH JUDGES TO

03:04:10.806 --> 03:04:11.940
QUICKLY SUMMARIZE THEM I THINK

03:04:12.007 --> 03:04:13.175
IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

03:04:13.242 --> 03:04:15.043
THAT TOLL FREE NUMBER- I THINK

03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:16.078
IT'S BEEN STATED A FEW TIMES

03:04:16.145 --> 03:04:17.212
HERE THIS MORNING THAT. YOU

03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:21.083
KNOW THE IT'S REALLY- OUT LIAR

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:23.252
THOSE HIGHER FEES- SO TO THAT

03:04:23.318 --> 03:04:24.753
EXTENT THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:25.988
THINK ABOUT. MEASURES TO

03:04:26.054 --> 03:04:27.523
CURTAIL SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES

03:04:27.589 --> 03:04:29.258
WHETHER THAT'S LOOKING AT-

03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:30.159
ACTUAL LANGUAGE IN THE

03:04:30.225 --> 03:04:31.660
MEDICATION FEE ACT OR REQUIRING

03:04:31.727 --> 03:04:33.028
SOME SORT OF FEASIBILITY

03:04:33.095 --> 03:04:35.397
ANALYSIS- THATWOULD KICK IN

03:04:35.464 --> 03:04:36.932
AFTER A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEES

03:04:36.999 --> 03:04:38.467
ARE ARE HIGHER THAN. THAN

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:40.068
AVERAGE RENTER AVERAGE HOME

03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:41.470
PRICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

03:04:41.537 --> 03:04:43.705
BUT I ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:46.041
SUCH TOTAL FEEL. IMPORT OTHER

03:04:46.108 --> 03:04:48.243
LIST BEFORE FROM A HANDFUL OF

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:49.445
CITIES THAT HAVE DONE SOME

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:51.980
REALLY I THINK INNOVATIVE.

03:04:52.047 --> 03:04:55.017
THINGS TO REFORM THE WAY THE

03:04:55.083 --> 03:04:58.987
AMP FEES THERE IS OFTEN FEET

03:04:59.054 --> 03:05:04.726
PEARL. CHANGE WHAT TO SAY. AS

03:05:04.793 --> 03:05:07.429
FAR AND- SOME OF THE OTHER

03:05:07.496 --> 03:05:08.063
PROGRAMS TO DEVELOPERS CO WITH

03:05:08.130 --> 03:05:08.997
THAT BECAUSE REALLY SPREAD IT

03:05:09.064 --> 03:05:09.798
OUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:10.866
TIME SO ARE IDEA I THINK WE

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:11.500
SHOULD BE EXT AS WELL ON IN IN

03:05:11.567 --> 03:05:13.001
THE ONE LAST A TO IT'S BEEN

03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:15.304
MADE A FEW TO A THAT THESE

03:05:15.370 --> 03:05:16.772
THESE ARE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

03:05:16.839 --> 03:05:18.574
CITIES ANY CASE RIGHT THERE

03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:20.342
BANG FOR. THINGS THAT WE ALL IN

03:05:20.409 --> 03:05:22.578
AND WE WILL SEE PARKS BERRIES

03:05:22.644 --> 03:05:24.379
ARE FIRE SAFETY. THINGS OF THIS

03:05:24.446 --> 03:05:26.515
NATURE. AND CITIES ARE REALLY

03:05:26.582 --> 03:05:27.749
CONSTRAINED IN THE WAY THAT

03:05:27.816 --> 03:05:28.617
THEY CAN RAISE REVENUE RIGHT

03:05:28.684 --> 03:05:29.585
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF. A

03:05:29.651 --> 03:05:30.586
LARGELY BECAUSE OF OUR PROPERTY

03:05:30.652 --> 03:05:32.087
TAX STRUCTURE AND SO AT THE

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:33.388
SAME TIME AS WE'RE DISCUSSING.

03:05:33.455 --> 03:05:34.890
THE NEED TO REFORM THE WAY

03:05:34.957 --> 03:05:36.625
CITIES. CALCULATES AND IMPOSE

03:05:36.692 --> 03:05:37.926
FEES WE SHOULD ALSO BE

03:05:37.993 --> 03:05:39.127
DISCUSSING WAYS IN WHICH WE

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.196
CAN- PROVIDE RESOURCES SO THAT

03:05:41.263 --> 03:05:43.632
WE CAN CONTINUE TO. UPGRADE AND

03:05:43.699 --> 03:05:45.100
BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP

03:05:45.167 --> 03:05:47.169
OUR COMMUNITY IS TO THE LEVELS

03:05:47.236 --> 03:05:48.136
OF. THAT THE WE ASPIRE. TO BE

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:52.841

WILL JUMP IN SO THERE IS SOME

03:06:08.423 --> 03:06:10.292
SENSE WITH CITIES THAT HAVE

03:06:10.359 --> 03:06:13.495
HIGHER FEES- THAT THESE ARE

03:06:13.562 --> 03:06:14.196
CITIES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY

03:06:14.263 --> 03:06:15.797
WANT TO BUILD SO THEY'RE FINE

03:06:15.864 --> 03:06:18.300

THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST FEES IS

03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:28.644

M. THE IN FEES. I'M IT'S HARD

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.489
TO SAY- I THINK A LOT OF TIMES

03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:42.357
IT IT MAY BE THAT THEY DON'T

03:06:42.424 --> 03:06:43.559
HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO

03:06:43.625 --> 03:06:45.561
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ON WHAT

03:06:45.627 --> 03:06:47.129
THE FEE SHOULD BE. RIGHT AND

03:06:47.195 --> 03:06:48.864
THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT I

03:06:48.931 --> 03:06:49.464
MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THERE'S

03:06:49.531 --> 03:06:50.332
NO FEASIBILITY STAND CITIES

03:06:50.399 --> 03:06:52.034
HAPPEN PLOY TO SET THEIR FEES

03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:53.435
AT A LEVEL THAT THEY KNOW WILL

03:06:53.502 --> 03:06:54.403
NOT HINDER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:56.572
AND SO THEY MAY HEAR THAT. A

03:06:56.638 --> 03:06:58.707
COMMUNITY NEXT DOOR HAS SYMBOL

03:06:58.774 --> 03:07:00.676
THE HIGH FEES AND SAY WELL IF

03:07:00.742 --> 03:07:02.678
THEY CAN HANDLE IT AND YOU KNOW

03:07:02.744 --> 03:07:05.314
ARM CAN HANDLE TO. ANSWER THIS

03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:06.949
IS A BET THIS IS TURNING FEE

03:07:07.015 --> 03:07:10.719
SHOULD BE AND- I. BUT THINK THE

03:07:10.786 --> 03:07:12.854
OUR INTENTION HOLD ON SOME OF

03:07:12.921 --> 03:07:14.389
THE TIME BUT A IT'S REALLY HARD

03:07:14.456 --> 03:07:15.891
FOR SEIZE MAKE THESE DECISIONS

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:17.092
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE

03:07:17.159 --> 03:07:18.727
INFORMATION NECESSARY TO

03:07:18.794 --> 03:07:21.663
REALLY- FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:24.566
RIGHT RATE IS RIGHT WITH THE

RIGHT TO THEIR FEES AT THAT

03:07:25.634 --> 03:07:28.003
THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION YOU.

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.937
TO ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF THE

03:07:29.004 --> 03:07:30.606
IMPACT OF THEIR FEES IT'S NOT

03:07:30.672 --> 03:07:31.740
SOMETHING THAT CITIES CURRENTLY

PERCEPTION OF WEST SO. IDEA

03:07:41.583 --> 03:07:43.018
THERE WOULD BE TOOLS AVAILABLE

03:07:43.085 --> 03:07:44.119
THE SYSTEM THE TURNER CENTER

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:44.820
HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT TRYING

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:47.055
TO DEVELOP MORE MORE BROUGH BUS

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:48.557
VERSION OF. YOU WOULD BE ABLE

WORKING CONDITIONS ANOTHER. HOW

03:07:53.695 --> 03:07:55.497
DIFFERENT LEVELS WOULD IMPACT

03:07:55.564 --> 03:07:57.532
FEASIBILITY DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR

03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:59.701

BE A TO DATE PUBLISHED I THAT

03:08:10.379 --> 03:08:11.713
WOULD GO LONG WAYS TOWARDS

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:12.681
PARTICULARLY SMALLER AND MID

03:08:12.748 --> 03:08:14.349
SIZE CITIES HAVE THIS KIND OF

03:08:14.416 --> 03:08:16.385
INFORMATION- BUT THE FEELING

03:08:16.451 --> 03:08:17.352
THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SORT

03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:21.089

PERCENT. I'M SERVE IN A TWO.

03:08:25.527 --> 03:08:27.462
ACOSTA THAT THEN YOU'LL TO THE

03:08:27.529 --> 03:08:28.664
STATE WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE A

03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:30.165
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OF THIS TO

03:08:30.232 --> 03:08:31.667
BE SIMILAR TO WHAT. SEC

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:55.924
LEVEL OF IMPACT FEES FOR THEM

03:08:55.991 --> 03:08:58.560
IS- COULD BE SELF DEFEATING

03:08:58.627 --> 03:08:59.327
WE'RE TRYING TO ASK

AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THESE ARE

03:09:02.264 --> 03:09:03.865
UNITS THAT ARE NOT ACCRUING

03:09:03.932 --> 03:09:06.268
PROFIT TO DEVELOPERS AND YET

03:09:06.334 --> 03:09:06.902
WE'RE SETTLEMENT WITH THE EXACT

03:09:06.968 --> 03:09:09.771
SAME FEES. CURIOUS IF WE WERE

03:09:11.273 --> 03:09:13.275
LIMITED IMPACT FEES FOR

AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HOW

03:09:14.209 --> 03:09:16.378
WILL IT CHANGE THE CALCULUS OF

03:09:16.445 --> 03:09:18.747
WHETHER YOU. DEVELOP MORE. FOR

03:09:18.814 --> 03:09:21.416
WHAT. IT'S YEAH THE IT'S A

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:25.020
GREAT. ON A INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AT

03:09:25.087 --> 03:09:27.489
REDUCTION OF ANY COST- RESULTS

03:09:27.556 --> 03:09:28.924
IN NEEDING TO ASK FOR A LOT

LESS TAX CREDITS LESS BONDS

03:09:31.193 --> 03:09:34.096
LESS LOCAL SUBSIDY SO-

03:09:34.162 --> 03:09:35.464
ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD BE

03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:37.332
DOING IS SPREADING THE LIMITED

03:09:37.399 --> 03:09:39.434
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OVER

03:09:39.501 --> 03:09:42.337
POTENTIALLY MORE UNITS- AND TO

03:09:42.404 --> 03:09:44.639
THE EXTENT THAT THE DESIRE OF

03:09:44.706 --> 03:09:47.809

TO SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENCY IN

03:09:58.520 --> 03:09:59.955
THE HOMELESS PROBLEM HAS HAS

03:10:00.021 --> 03:10:01.957
REALLY I THINK CHANGE THE

03:10:02.023 --> 03:10:03.425
DYNAMICS ON BOTH IN SACRAMENTO

03:10:03.492 --> 03:10:05.093

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:08.764
LOT OF JURISDICTIONS WANTING TO

03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:09.798
TRY TO MAKE THINGS WORK BUT

03:10:09.865 --> 03:10:12.701
BEING CAUGHT UP AND- KIND OF

WITH. TO BUILD CAPACITY IN I

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.514
KIND OF GET ON THE RIGHT TRACK

03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:27.482

AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:10:29.117 --> 03:10:32.254
DEVELOPMENTS- IMPACT FEES COULD

BE REDUCED- IT WOULD IT WOULD

03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:36.258
RESULT IN THE DIRECT PRODUCTION

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:38.093
OF MORE UNITS. THANK YOU I KNOW

MEAN LIKE IF YEAR WE HAVE THE

03:11:02.951 --> 03:11:05.320
BUILDING WOULD SAY SIXTY MARKET

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:07.489
RATE THIRTY YEAR TWENTY

03:11:07.556 --> 03:11:09.624
AFFORDABLE ARE THEY REDUCING

FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF SANTA

03:11:22.470 --> 03:11:24.506
ROSA ORDINANCE BASICALLY

03:11:24.573 --> 03:11:27.409

THE PLEDGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:37.385

THE- ON THE EIGHTY USE I THINK

03:12:04.512 --> 03:12:05.881
THAT EXAMPLE WAS REALLY A

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.415

ON THE STATE AND GLOBAL BASIS

03:12:14.089 --> 03:12:15.857
WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE

03:12:15.924 --> 03:12:18.894
EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES THAT'S WHY

03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:21.229
WE'RE HERE TODAY YOU CAN SEE IF

03:12:21.296 --> 03:12:25.700

NEED THOSE IN AND ALL THE JOY.

03:12:29.671 --> 03:12:31.172
LOCALLY THAT WE BUILD AND

03:12:31.239 --> 03:12:33.108
WHETHER IT'S PARKS ROAD SEWER

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:35.143
WATER ALL THOSE KIND OF THING

03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:35.610
SO IT'S NOT THAT WERE

03:12:35.677 --> 03:12:38.346
ADVOCATING TO JUST DO AWAY WITH

03:12:38.413 --> 03:12:39.614
FEES WHAT WE'RE REALLY

03:12:39.681 --> 03:12:41.950
DISCUSSING HERE IS TRYING TO

03:12:42.017 --> 03:12:44.219
MAKE SIMPLE DECISIONS ON HOW TO

03:12:44.286 --> 03:12:44.719
WE SHOULD THE BURDEN OF

03:12:44.786 --> 03:12:45.954
RESPONSE THEY KEEP THE HIGH

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:48.890
CALL OF LIFE. PENSIONS MANY THE

03:12:48.957 --> 03:12:50.392
JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE THE HIGH

03:12:50.458 --> 03:12:51.459
FEES ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT

03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:52.494
ARE BUILDING THE MOST HOUSING

03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:54.462
IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW SO IT'S

03:12:54.529 --> 03:12:56.064
CONVERSE TO THE HIGHEST CITIES

03:12:56.131 --> 03:12:59.567
PRETTY LAST HOUSING BECAUSE

03:12:59.634 --> 03:13:00.902
THAT THAT THAT'S JUST KIND OF A

03:13:00.969 --> 03:13:03.305
BAD ACTOR DURATION BUT NORMALLY

03:13:03.371 --> 03:13:03.838
THE- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

03:13:03.905 --> 03:13:06.641
TRYING TO BUILD MORE HOUSING

03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:09.945
HAVE HIGHER FEES. WITH IT RATE

03:13:10.011 --> 03:13:12.514
AND THEN DOING CLUES ARE UNITS

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:16.551
WERE THIS THE TOP. FORTY THAT

03:13:16.618 --> 03:13:19.654
WOULD REFER TO SAN. UP I'M NOT

03:13:19.721 --> 03:13:21.222
FEE REDUCTIONS IF ROSESTO

03:13:21.289 --> 03:13:21.823
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY PROGRAM AND

03:13:21.890 --> 03:13:22.691
THEN WE END UP BECOMING A

03:13:22.757 --> 03:13:25.493
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIRED-

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:27.662
SITUATION SO GENERALLY SPEAKING

03:13:27.729 --> 03:13:30.398
NOW ON ON THE COMBINED PROJECTS

03:13:30.465 --> 03:13:33.168
THROUGH INCLUSIONARY ZONING WE

03:13:33.234 --> 03:13:34.336
CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY

03:13:34.402 --> 03:13:37.405
FEE REDUCTION. AND I. YOU CAN

03:13:37.472 --> 03:13:39.274
REST OF IT SURE. FROM MY

03:13:39.341 --> 03:13:42.110
EXPERIENCE- MOST JURISDICTIONS

03:13:42.177 --> 03:13:44.646
ARE STILL LIMITING THEIR FEE

03:13:44.713 --> 03:13:46.348
WAIVERS ARE DEFERRALS WHICH IS

03:13:46.414 --> 03:13:48.984
THE TWO CAN REMAIN PROGRAMS

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:50.986
THAT THAT- JURISDICTIONS ARE

03:13:51.052 --> 03:13:54.089
USING TO REDUCE FEES- FOR

03:13:54.155 --> 03:13:56.024
AFFORDABLE UNITS AND WHETHER OR

03:13:56.091 --> 03:13:58.093
NOT THEY DEFINE AFFORDABLE

03:13:58.159 --> 03:14:00.962
UNITS SAYS THE PERSON. IN AN 8%

03:14:01.029 --> 03:14:02.597
HUNTER AND TWENTY I THINK IT

03:14:02.664 --> 03:14:04.466
REALLY VARIES AMONG

03:14:04.532 --> 03:14:08.370
JURISDICTION- BUT BUT I WILL

03:14:08.436 --> 03:14:12.540
NOTE- THAT- IT IS TRUE THAT AS

03:14:12.607 --> 03:14:16.244
YOU KNOW FEE WAIVERS I'M DUE

03:14:16.311 --> 03:14:18.313
IN. DEVELOPMENTS IN IN A WAY

03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:19.748
THAT THAT TRIGGERS PREVAILING

03:14:19.814 --> 03:14:22.617
WAGE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:24.652
HAVE DEFERRAL PROGRAMS AT LONG

03:14:24.719 --> 03:14:27.622
TERM REFERRAL PROGRAM SO I'M-

03:14:27.689 --> 03:14:30.291
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT I AND

03:14:30.358 --> 03:14:32.460
SURE THAT THE PROJECT IS ABLE.

03:14:32.527 --> 03:14:36.064
TO MOVE OR AND THE SUBJECT

03:14:36.131 --> 03:14:38.933
PREVAILING WAIT SO THAT WAY.

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:42.537
THE STRUCTURE. TO FOUND THANK

03:14:42.604 --> 03:14:48.209
COSTS OF. IN DIFFERENT THAT ARE

03:14:48.276 --> 03:14:49.944
MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO FOR

03:14:50.011 --> 03:14:51.946
HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT. ONE

03:14:52.013 --> 03:14:53.648
THING ALLOWED TO YEAR. SENATORS

03:14:53.715 --> 03:14:56.184
AT- YOU KNOW WE TRY TO TRACK

03:14:56.251 --> 03:14:57.252
EIGHTY USE PRETTY CLOSELY AND

03:14:57.318 --> 03:14:59.487
WE HAVE SEEN MORE MORE CITIES-

03:14:59.554 --> 03:15:01.589
START IF THEY'RE IMPACT FEES

03:15:01.656 --> 03:15:03.391
FOR TO SPEAK TO ONE UNITS ARE

03:15:03.458 --> 03:15:07.429
ON IT WE ARE TOO BECAUSE OF

03:15:07.495 --> 03:15:09.631
THAT EARLIER AND IT IT ALSO.

03:15:09.697 --> 03:15:11.633
BECAUSE PUSHING SIT. HERE THIS

03:15:11.699 --> 03:15:12.600
DO WE WANTED TO ALLOW THE STATE

03:15:12.667 --> 03:15:14.436
DOES GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT

03:15:14.502 --> 03:15:15.837
SO THAT IS. SO WE SEE THIS AS A

324% RANGE WHICH WE WOULD LOVE

03:16:31.079 --> 03:16:33.648
TO SEE THAT BE THE CASETHIS IS

03:16:33.715 --> 03:16:36.017
ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT WE BUY

03:16:36.084 --> 03:16:39.487
OUT OF. HOLDEN WHY STATE AND

03:16:39.554 --> 03:16:42.123

THAT PRODUCT VERSES THE 10218%

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:49.264
YOU SEE THERE. BUT ALL THE

03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:50.932
COMMUNITIES WHICH- WERE

03:16:50.999 --> 03:16:52.400
PRODUCING THE MOST AMOUNT OF

03:16:52.467 --> 03:16:54.602
HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIA. HAS TO

03:16:54.669 --> 03:16:55.503
BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT

03:16:55.570 --> 03:16:57.305
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDE

03:16:57.372 --> 03:17:00.008
THOSE COMMUNITY SERVICES IS A

03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:00.875
GENTLEMAN FROM RIVERSIDE

03:17:00.942 --> 03:17:02.677
INDICATED SO. IT'S A TRADE OFF

03:17:02.744 --> 03:17:04.979
WERE WERE BUILDING HOUSES WHERE

03:17:05.046 --> 03:17:06.881
WE CAN BUILD. AND TRY TO MAKE

03:17:06.948 --> 03:17:09.551
IT WORK- FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE.

03:17:09.617 --> 03:17:10.818
AND WE'RE NOT BUILDING HOUSES

03:17:10.885 --> 03:17:12.353
WHERE THE JOBS ARE SO THEN WE

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:13.988
PUT THE AND WE PUT THE STRESS

03:17:14.055 --> 03:17:15.190
ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED

03:17:15.256 --> 03:17:16.791
MORE MEDI XIN MORE IMPACTS.

03:17:16.858 --> 03:17:19.093
THAT MISSIONAL STRUCTURE MEETS

03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:20.261
THE BILL LIKE PARKS AND ROADS

03:17:20.328 --> 03:17:23.731
AND SEWER AND WATER AND SUCH.

03:17:23.798 --> 03:17:27.168
BUT BECAUSE THERE'S- NOBLE AND-

03:17:27.235 --> 03:17:30.505
IN THE MARKET FOR. WE CAN MAKE

03:17:30.572 --> 03:17:32.507
IT WORK AT A LOT OF THE EXTENT

03:17:32.574 --> 03:17:34.576
AND BUT DO SEE HIGHER FEES AND

03:17:34.642 --> 03:17:36.711
MOST PLACES THAT WE BUILT.

03:17:36.778 --> 03:17:39.013
BECAUSE THAT'S A NEWER. THAT

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:40.949
DOESN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:17:41.015 --> 03:17:46.554
CORRECT. SO I WAS GOING TO ASK

03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:48.289
WITH SOUNDS LIKE I'M GETTING

03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:52.293
PARTIAL ANSWER HERE IS WHAT IS.

03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:55.096
WHAT IS THE SORT OF ACCEPTABLE

03:17:55.163 --> 03:17:57.265
FEES AND I ASSUME THAT DEPENDS

03:17:57.332 --> 03:17:59.901
ON WHERE YOU'RE DOING THE

03:17:59.968 --> 03:18:01.636
BUILDING NO THE CONSTRUCTION

03:18:01.703 --> 03:18:05.406
AND AT WHAT POINT DO THESE FEES

03:18:05.473 --> 03:18:08.876
REALLY HELP. MORE CONSTRUCTION

03:18:08.943 --> 03:18:11.913
MORE MORE BUILDING AND

03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:12.413
ESPECIALLY OF AFFORDABLE

03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:14.983
HOUSING. THE THOUGHTS OF IT YOU

03:18:15.049 --> 03:18:17.285
KNOW RIGHT OTHERWISE I THINK WE

03:18:17.352 --> 03:18:19.254
JUST SHOOTING IN THE DARK OF

03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:21.956
LET'S REDUCE FEES BUT WE DON'T

03:18:22.023 --> 03:18:24.225
REALLY KNOW AT WHAT POINT. IT

03:18:24.292 --> 03:18:25.960
KICKS IN TO ACTUALLY HELP.

03:18:26.027 --> 03:18:27.962
ABSOLUTELY AND ACTION AND

03:18:28.029 --> 03:18:29.197
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WITH A

03:18:29.264 --> 03:18:31.132
VERY COMPLEX RESPONSE I THINK

03:18:31.199 --> 03:18:31.666
YOU HAVE SOME OF THE BEST

03:18:31.733 --> 03:18:33.835
EXPERTS- HERE BEFORE YOU THIS

03:18:33.901 --> 03:18:35.470
MORNING AND AT THE TABLE RIGHT

03:18:35.536 --> 03:18:38.273
NOW. RELATED TO THIS AND IT THE

03:18:38.339 --> 03:18:39.841
PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING

03:18:39.907 --> 03:18:41.175
TO DO IS WE CAN'T COME UP WITH

03:18:41.242 --> 03:18:42.510
A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S

03:18:42.577 --> 03:18:44.078
GOING TO BE A WITH A ONE ALL

03:18:44.145 --> 03:18:46.014
FIX ALL FOR EVERYTHING. BUT

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:47.982
WHAT I THINK I'M HEARING TODAY

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:50.184
IS THAT THERE ARE SOME

03:18:50.251 --> 03:18:51.653
SUGGESTIONS AND IT'S KIND OF

03:18:51.719 --> 03:18:53.288
THE CARROT AND THE STICK

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:54.622
APPROACH MAYBE MAYBE WITH

03:18:54.689 --> 03:18:56.557
INCREASE PRODUCTION THIS COULD

03:18:56.624 --> 03:18:58.126
OFFSET SOME OF THE BURDEN. TO

03:18:58.192 --> 03:19:00.862
THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FIRE

03:19:00.928 --> 03:19:02.964
AND WATER AND SEWER AND- PARKS

03:19:03.031 --> 03:19:06.934
AND ROADS- TO INCENTIVIZE THEM

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:09.370
TO BRIDGE THAT GAP FOR THAT

03:19:09.437 --> 03:19:11.806
COMMUNITY. BENEFIT OR COMMUNITY

03:19:11.873 --> 03:19:14.108
IMPROVEMENTS OR QUALITY OF LIFE

03:19:14.175 --> 03:19:15.810
FOR OF THE ENHANCED

03:19:15.877 --> 03:19:17.111
CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOP

03:19:17.178 --> 03:19:19.480
ANOTHER PRESSURE HOUSING THAT

03:19:19.547 --> 03:19:26.754
WE NEED I YOU CAN READ. SEE

03:19:26.821 --> 03:19:32.093
COMPLETE. IF DID FROM. THEM HI

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:33.261
BUT THAT DOESN'T FIX. OUR LONG

03:19:33.328 --> 03:19:34.062
TERM ISSUE AND IT IS DIFFERENT

03:19:34.128 --> 03:19:35.029
EVERY YEAR YOU SEE THE ARE.

03:19:35.096 --> 03:19:36.764
PROJECTS AND CAL. IN AND MOST

03:19:36.831 --> 03:19:37.865
OF OUR BILL. REPRESENTED ARE

03:19:37.932 --> 03:19:39.567
DOING AND A LOT OF THE CITY'S A

03:19:39.634 --> 03:19:42.036
THAT I PROVIDED FOR YOU WERE

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:42.937
FEES ARE MUCH MUCH MORE

03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:44.005
EXPENSIVE AND SO THERE'S JUST

03:19:44.072 --> 03:19:47.108
NOT A GOOD FIX FOR EVERYTHING

03:19:47.175 --> 03:19:48.076
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S- SOME

03:19:48.142 --> 03:19:50.211
TOOL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

03:19:50.278 --> 03:19:52.814
AMPLE. PLATE AVAILABLE ENSUE

03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:54.048
MUCH MORE RESIDENTIAL

FROM IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:20:02.824 --> 03:20:07.662
PERSPECTIVE- THE WAY I AM THINK

03:20:07.729 --> 03:20:10.932
ABOUT THINGS IS EVERY DOLLAR

03:20:10.998 --> 03:20:12.633
REDUCTION IN FEES STRUCTURE

03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:14.202
CREATES ANOTHER DOLLAR FOR AN

03:20:14.268 --> 03:20:16.838
ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNIT- TO PUT

03:20:16.904 --> 03:20:18.740
IT IN CONTEXT TWO THOUSAND AND

THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

JUST BECAUSE I THINK IN THE END

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:43.291
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:21:43.357 --> 03:21:45.226
PEOPLE ARE. GETTING THE WAGES

03:21:45.293 --> 03:21:46.928
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

BUY A HOME OR TO BE ABLE TO DO

03:21:48.863 --> 03:21:50.731
THE THINGS THAT THAT WE ALL

WHERE AND HOW AND WHO PAYS FOR

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:14.388
THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE

03:22:14.455 --> 03:22:16.224
LUXURY OF SAYING WORRY ABOUT

03:22:16.290 --> 03:22:18.292

03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:37.345
CAN'T ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR

03:22:37.411 --> 03:22:39.780
THOSE THINGS. ONE THING I THINK

03:22:39.847 --> 03:22:40.882
IT'S BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:42.116
CONVERSATION IS REALLY

03:22:42.183 --> 03:22:43.017
IMPORTANT IS THAT THE FEDERAL

03:22:43.084 --> 03:22:44.285
GOVERNMENT USED TO PLAY A BIG

03:22:44.352 --> 03:22:44.886
ROLE BUILDING THIS

03:22:44.952 --> 03:22:47.321
INFRASTRUCTURE A LONG TIME AGO-

03:22:47.388 --> 03:22:49.390
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

03:22:49.457 --> 03:22:50.458
RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO BE

03:22:50.525 --> 03:22:51.559
CONTINUALLY INVESTING IN.

03:22:51.626 --> 03:22:53.728
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS NOT

03:22:53.794 --> 03:22:55.963
BEEN THE OTHER PARTY THIS

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.999
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION- THAT

03:22:58.065 --> 03:22:59.333
BEING SAID THERE ARE MANY

03:22:59.400 --> 03:23:03.170
PARTIES- THAT A- AND NEXT

03:23:03.237 --> 03:23:05.473
ADMINISTRATION- MAY PRIORITIZE

03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:07.174
AS INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT SO.

03:23:07.241 --> 03:23:08.376
THAT THE BEES MAY CONSIDER AS

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:11.279
WELL OKAY. OKAY I WILL ADD FROM

03:23:11.345 --> 03:23:13.047
THE VA THERE'S PERSPECTIVE THE

03:23:13.114 --> 03:23:14.048
TWO THINGS THAT ARE BUILDERS

03:23:14.115 --> 03:23:16.450
ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR OUR

03:23:16.517 --> 03:23:19.854
CERTAINTY REGARDING TIME. AND

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:22.123
CERTAINTY REGARDING COST SO

03:23:22.189 --> 03:23:23.591
INSTEAD OF PERHAPS LOOKING AT

03:23:23.658 --> 03:23:25.626
WHO'S GOING TO SPEND THE DOLLAR

03:23:25.693 --> 03:23:27.929
BY REDUCING COLLECTIVELY HOW

03:23:27.995 --> 03:23:30.431
MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST OF WE

03:23:30.498 --> 03:23:32.700
CAN ALL BENEFIT AND THE TWO

03:23:32.767 --> 03:23:34.201
THINGS THAT HELP US WITH THAT%

03:23:34.268 --> 03:23:36.871
ARE CREATING CERTAINTY IN TERMS

03:23:36.938 --> 03:23:38.606
OF THE TIMING FOR OUR PROCESS.

03:23:38.673 --> 03:23:40.741

IDAHO AND WASHING SURE STATE

03:26:14.829 --> 03:26:16.097
BECAUSE WHAT WE LIKE MOST

03:26:16.163 --> 03:26:17.565
PUBLIC BUILDERS HAVE TO PRAY

03:26:17.631 --> 03:26:19.233
OUR RESPONSIBILITY OUR

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:20.701
LIABILITIES. AND IT'S BECOME

03:26:20.768 --> 03:26:23.471
VERY SPECULATIVE IN VERY RISKY

03:26:23.537 --> 03:26:25.673
IN CALIFORNIA TO. BE A PRIVATE

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:28.142
HOME BUILDER. I TRIED TO GET MY

03:26:28.209 --> 03:26:29.810
SON THIRD GENERATION HOME

03:26:29.877 --> 03:26:31.812
BUILDER TO DO ANYTHING ELSE

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:34.615
THAT HE WANTED BESIDES BECOMING

03:26:34.682 --> 03:26:35.249
A HOME BUILDER BUT I COULDN'T.

03:26:35.316 --> 03:26:36.183
HIM IS THIS IS WHAT HE REALLY

03:26:36.250 --> 03:26:37.551

FATHER'S PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. I

03:26:41.222 --> 03:26:42.923
THE THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE

03:26:42.990 --> 03:26:44.658
FITS ALL BUT YOU'VE SEEN

03:26:44.725 --> 03:26:46.861
THROUGH A LOT. INFORMATION

03:26:46.927 --> 03:26:48.028
TODAY IF YOU CAN REDUCE COST

03:26:48.095 --> 03:26:51.565
YOU CAN. MORE AND CALIFORNIA

03:26:51.632 --> 03:26:54.535
HOME BILL. ARE TRYING TO USE A

03:26:54.602 --> 03:26:55.269
HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES ARE

03:26:55.336 --> 03:26:56.804
TRYING TO PRODUCES MANY HOMES

03:26:56.871 --> 03:26:58.339
AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE

03:26:58.405 --> 03:26:59.240
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR

03:26:59.306 --> 03:27:00.574
WE'RE HERE TO BUILT AND IF WE

03:27:00.641 --> 03:27:03.077
CAN BUILD MORE WE WILL. THEN

03:27:03.144 --> 03:27:05.579
THE DILEMMA IS WE CAN'T GET THE

03:27:05.646 --> 03:27:07.515
REVENUES TO MEET THE EXPENSE SO

03:27:07.581 --> 03:27:11.118
IF WE CAN REDUCE. THE EXPENSES

03:27:11.185 --> 03:27:12.787
AND ALSO SLIGHTLY REDUCE OUR

03:27:12.853 --> 03:27:15.122
REVENUE SO WE CAN MEET MORE OF

03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:17.358
THE CONSUMER PROFILE THE NEED

03:27:17.424 --> 03:27:18.392
FOR THE WORK FORCE HOUSING FOR

03:27:18.459 --> 03:27:20.461
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR THE

03:27:20.528 --> 03:27:22.329
HOUSING STOCK THAT'S REALLY

03:27:22.396 --> 03:27:23.631
GOING TO PUT PEOPLE BACK IN.

03:27:23.697 --> 03:27:25.599
THE SHELTER INSTEAD OF BEING ON

03:27:25.666 --> 03:27:28.636
SHELTERED. THAT'S OUR GOAL AND

03:27:28.702 --> 03:27:31.172
SO IF WE CAN REDUCE. ANY PART

03:27:31.238 --> 03:27:32.840
OF THE COST EQUATION I GIVE YOU

03:27:32.907 --> 03:27:34.909
THE TEN LINE ITEM THERE'S EIGHT

03:27:34.975 --> 03:27:36.577
OF THEM THAT WE CAN WORK ON. I

03:27:36.644 --> 03:27:38.078
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT

03:27:38.145 --> 03:27:39.346
THE MONEY WOULD GO BACK TO THE

03:27:39.413 --> 03:27:41.215
LANDOWNERS RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT

03:27:41.282 --> 03:27:42.516
BUILDING HOMES BECAUSE THERE'S%

03:27:42.583 --> 03:27:44.852
NO RESIDUAL LAND TO A LOT OF.

03:27:44.919 --> 03:27:47.054
LAND THAT IS BUILDABLE FOR

03:27:47.121 --> 03:27:49.356
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA- THERE

03:27:49.423 --> 03:27:50.858
MAY BE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE

03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:53.561
VALUES DO DO GO UP. SLIGHTLY

03:27:53.627 --> 03:27:56.063
BUT WHAT BUT LEAVING THE

03:27:56.130 --> 03:27:57.498
REVENUE WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW

03:27:57.565 --> 03:27:58.799
ISN'T THE ANSWER WE NEED TO

03:27:58.866 --> 03:28:00.201
BRING THE COST OF ALL HOUSING

03:28:00.267 --> 03:28:02.002
DOWN OF THE REASON WHY THE COST

03:28:02.069 --> 03:28:04.104
KEEPS GOING UP IS. YOU CAN

03:28:04.171 --> 03:28:05.472
EASILY SEE FOR MY INFORMATION

03:28:05.539 --> 03:28:06.874
IN THE PERFECT. IF THE FEES FOR

03:28:06.941 --> 03:28:08.442
A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

03:28:08.509 --> 03:28:10.678
HOUSE. REPRESENT 10% OF THAT

03:28:10.744 --> 03:28:12.713
COST I IN THE FEES ARE PER UNIT

03:28:12.780 --> 03:28:14.281
AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. I

03:28:14.348 --> 03:28:16.350
COULD REDUCE THAT LINE ITEM THE

03:28:16.417 --> 03:28:18.052
5% IF I BUILD A MILLION DOLLAR

03:28:18.118 --> 03:28:19.553
HOUSE. AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY

03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:21.121
HOMES BEING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA

03:28:21.188 --> 03:28:22.690
TODAY ARE FOR THE HAVES OR THE

03:28:22.756 --> 03:28:24.692
HAVE NOTS WE'RE MISSING THE

03:28:24.758 --> 03:28:26.293
MIDDLE WHICH IS THE WORK FORCE

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:27.995
HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE

03:28:28.062 --> 03:28:31.131
IMPLEMENTS IS FEES IT'S AN

03:28:31.198 --> 03:28:34.268
ISSUE. THAT HAS GROWN OVER THE

03:28:34.335 --> 03:28:36.170
LAST FORTY SOME YEARS TO. THE

03:28:36.237 --> 03:28:38.472
VERY DISPARAGING SITUATION AND

03:28:38.539 --> 03:28:39.907
I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO

03:28:39.974 --> 03:28:41.942
ADDRESS IT IT'S JUST IT NEEDS

03:28:42.009 --> 03:28:43.377
TO BE ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY AND

03:28:43.444 --> 03:28:45.579
FAIRLY. SO THAT WE DON'T IMPACT

03:28:45.646 --> 03:28:47.514
ALL THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

03:28:47.581 --> 03:28:50.551
AND AS- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID

03:28:50.618 --> 03:28:53.153
WE IT'S YOU GOT A TRADE THE

03:28:53.220 --> 03:28:54.221
MONEY FROM ONE POCKET TO

03:28:54.288 --> 03:28:55.623
ANOTHER YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T

03:28:55.689 --> 03:28:57.324
JUST AS A SURLY TAKE ABOUT A

03:28:57.391 --> 03:28:59.860
ONE LINE ITEM AND PUT IT INTO.

03:28:59.927 --> 03:29:01.862
ANOTHER ONE SO WE TAKE IT AWAY

03:29:01.929 --> 03:29:03.330
FROM THE CITIES AND LOCAL

03:29:03.397 --> 03:29:08.469
RESTRICTIONS I GUESS THIS. FOR

03:29:08.535 --> 03:29:11.238
AFTER. PICK UP THE BALLOT. SO

03:29:11.305 --> 03:29:14.575
HEAD. MORE HERE I'M ASSUME

03:29:14.642 --> 03:29:16.343
MAYBE YOU BUILD MAREADY OR BOY

03:29:16.410 --> 03:29:17.611
IDAHO CORRECT WHAT WOULD IT

03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:19.380
LOOK LIKE SIDE SIDE IN IN

03:29:19.446 --> 03:29:20.281
MERIDIAN RIGHT NOW HAVE COUPLE

03:29:20.347 --> 03:29:22.016
DEVELOP THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

03:29:22.082 --> 03:29:25.052
WORKING ON HER FEES FOR A FOUR

03:29:25.119 --> 03:29:26.553
HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLAR HOUSE

03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:27.988
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSE TO

03:29:28.055 --> 03:29:29.690
A MILLION DOLLARS IN LIVERMORE

03:29:29.757 --> 03:29:31.558
ARE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

03:29:31.625 --> 03:29:33.494
ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF

03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:36.263
THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE- IN THE-

03:29:36.330 --> 03:29:38.098
END THEY HAVE GREAT PARKS GREAT

03:29:38.165 --> 03:29:39.900
SCHOOLS GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE

03:29:39.967 --> 03:29:41.435
HAVE ALL THE WATER AND SEWER

AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE

03:29:42.269 --> 03:29:44.805
NEED SO. WHERE WHERE THE

03:29:44.872 --> 03:29:46.073
BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THERE AND

03:29:46.140 --> 03:29:47.841
HERE BECAME I THINK IT'S A

03:29:47.908 --> 03:29:49.343
FORTY YEAR PROCESS THAT WE'VE-

03:29:49.410 --> 03:29:52.179
