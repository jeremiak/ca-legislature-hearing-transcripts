WE OBVIOUSLY -- DON'T HAVE A A QUORUM PRESENT YET BUT WE WON'T LET THAT. LITTLE DETAIL HOLD US BACK -- WE WILL -- PUT THE AYE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR OVER UNTIL WE DO ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND BEGAN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE -- WITH. ISSUE ONE UNDER ITEMS TO BE HEARD -- WHICH IS CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION SEE THAT THE MISTRANSLATED HERE WITH HIS CREW SO IF YOU WOULD ALL STEP FORWARD. WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE ISSUE ONE WHICH IS AN INFORMATIONAL. HEARING -- TO GIVE US UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AUTHORITY AND AND ENFORCEMENT. WELCOME EVERYONE GOOD MORNING. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I'M JACK GAINES WORTH EXECUTIVE RECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS -- LISA HAGEE WHO IS -- ONE OF MY DEPUTY DIRECTORS IN CHARGE OF OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AT LEAST WILL BE PROVIDING. YOUR REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AUTHORITY FOR COASTAL ACCESS VIOLATIONS WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN OUR STATUTE FIVE YEARS AGO SO ALTERNATE OVER THE LEASE AT THIS POINT. THE MORNING GERMAN BLOOM COMMITTEE TODAY WERE PLEASED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH KEY FINDINGS -- FROM THE COSTA COMMISSIONS JANUARY FIFTEEN REPORT ON THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES TO RESOLVE COASTAL ACT VIOLATIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC ACCESS. AS AUTHORIZED BY PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THREE WAIT. TWENTY ONE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CONFERRED THIS AUTHORITY ON THE COMMISSION IN THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY FOURTEEN YOU ALSO REQUIRED US TO REPORT BACK ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. WE SUBMIT COPIES OF THE FULL REPORT WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. SO THIS MORNING I JUST GONNA DO A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AS YOU MAY KNOW OUR STANDARD ENFORCEMENT TOOL USED BY VIRTUALLY ALL STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETER AND RESOLVE CODE VIOLATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT. BECAUSE THE COSTA LIKE TO STARKLY LOCKED LACK THIS AUTHORITY OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAD BEEN MUCH LESS EFFICIENT THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE. WITH NO THREAT OF FINANCIAL PENALTY. INTENSE LITIGATION IS A SLOW AND EXPENSIVE MEANS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE AND COLLECT PENALTIES IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOME VIOLATIONS TO PROTECT. PERSIST FOR DECADES OR MORE WITHOUT RESOLUTION. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMMISSION'S OPEN BACKLOG OF UNRESOLVED VIOLATIONS IS GOING TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WITH MORE BEING ADDED EACH YEAR. SECTION THROUGH A TWENTY ONE NOW ENABLES THE COMMISSION TO ASSESS PENALTIES FOR PUBLIC ACCESS VIOLATIONS DIRECTLY. WHICH SAVE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE COMMISSION THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE COURTS THEMSELVES IT ALSO PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR VIOLATORS TO AVOID FINES BY SETTLING VOLUNTARILY. WHICH LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO IGNORE IT. THE DATA WE'VE COMPILED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS ALLOWED US TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND READ A RESOLUTION FOR CLOSE TO LIKE VIOLATIONS WITH AND WITHOUT ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AUTHORITY. OUR CURRENT PUBLIC ACCESS OF CASELOAD IS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO CASES OR ROUGHLY 30% OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OPEN VIOLATIONS. BECAUSE THIS IS MORE THAN WE COULD OP PROCESS THAT ONE TIME WITH THEIR CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS WE INITIALLY CONCENTRATED ON THE PILOT PROJECT OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CASES. NOTIFYING THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT THE VIOLATIONS WERE NOW SUBJECT TO THE POTENTIAL FINES UNDER THE NEW LAW. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE THIRTY DAY GRACE PERIOD FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO RESOLVE THE VIOLATIONS VOLUNTARILY AND COMPLETELY AVOID A PENALTY WE'RE PLEASED TO FIND THAT MANY PARTIES WERE WILLING TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS. AND COMPLY QUICKLY IN ORDER TO AVOID PENALTIES IN FACT BECAUSE OF OUR STAFFING CONSTRAINTS WE EXTENDED THE THIRTY DAYS IN MANY CASES WHEN WE HAVE PARTIES WERE WILLING TO SETTLE. AND FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATED MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE. SO AS A RESULT IN NINETY SIX OF THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CASES OR MORE THAN UNIVERSE WERE RESOLVED AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL WITH NO PENALTIES AT ALL. SOME OF THESE VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PERSISTING FOR MANY YEARS WITH NO MOVEMENT TOWARDS COMPLIANCE DESPITE EFFORTS BY COMMISSION STAFF. IN EACH OF THESE VIOLATIONS THAT REMAINED IN PLACE FOR YEARS HAD A CON COMMITMENT THE LACK OF PUBLIC ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC. EIGHT CASES REQUIRED FORMAL COMMISSION ACTION BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VIOLATIONS THE NATURE OF THE WORK RESULT REQUIRED TO RESOLVE THEM OR THE PARTY'S REFUSAL TO SETTLE. SIX OF THOSE EIGHT WERE SETTLED THROUGH CONSENT ORDERS WHICH WERE AGREED TO BY ALL THE PARTIES RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN PENALTIES AND PROJECTS. SOME OF THESE PAYMENTS HAVE ALREADY EEN DEAD DESIGNATED TO FOR THE COASTAL ACTS PUBLIC ACCESS GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE A PORTION OF A PENALTY PAID BY A RESTAURANT IN SAN MATEO COUNTY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO FIND PRELIMINARY WORK FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AN AXIS WAY ADMITTED MONTERO STATE BEACH. ADDITIONAL PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED WHEN PENALTIES ARE APPROPRIATED AND AVAILABLE IN THE VR A TOTAL WE'VE RESOLVED HUNDRED AND TWO OF OUR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN NOTICED CASES AND WE'RE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING ON THE REMAINDER. ONLY TWO OF THE INITIAL GROUP OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN VIOLATIONS HAVE RESULTED MEDICATION WHICH IS A VERY. LOW RATE INMUCH LOWER THAN THE RATE -- PRIOR TO THE EGGMAN PENALTIES. A REVIEW OF OUR PUBLIC ACCESS CASES SHOWS THAT HISTORICALLY IT TOOK AN AVERAGE OF ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE DAYS TO RESOLVE A PUBLIC ACCESS CASE WHICH IS A APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS. IN CONTRAST AFTER ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES THE AVERAGE TIME TO RESOLVE THE CASE IS NOW A HUNDRED ANDTWO DAYS OR ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MONTHS. MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THESE OR THERE RESULT IN THIRTY DAYS OR LESS AND ANOTHER FORTY TWO ARE RESOLVED BETWEEN THIRTY IN A HUNDRED DAYS. IT'S ACTUALLY A STUNNING OUTCOME IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN WE EXPECTED THE POTENTIAL FOR FINES WITHOUT EVEN COLLECTING THEM RESULTED IN 69% OF NOTIFIED VIOLATIONS RESOLVING WITHIN A HUNDRED DAYS. AS OPPOSED TO THE THREE YEARS PREVIOUSLY. OF COURSE PUBLIC ACCESS VIOLATIONS ARE NOT THE ONLY TYPE OF VIOLATION WE SEE IF YOU COMPARE AVERAGE RESOLUTION TIMES FOR THREE AWAIT TWENTY WENT ACCESS CASES WITH NON PUBLIC ACCESS CASES IT'S EVEN MORE DRAMATIC. DURING THE STATUTORY REPORTING PERIOD OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME TO RESOLVE IT THROUGH EIGHT TWENTY AND ONE CASE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWO DAYS. COMPARED TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DAYS FOR OVER FIVE YEARS INVOLVING HABITAT CASES. FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA OF THE BENEFITS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC USING THESE PENALTIES. THE COMMISSION IS RESOLVED IMPEDIMENTS AND OPEN UP ACCESS WAYS IN TWENTY CASES RESULT FORTY TWO CASES OF ILLEGAL NO PARKING AND ILLEGAL NO TRESPASSING SIGNS. WE'VE NEGOTIATED DIRECT PUBLIC BENEFITS SUCH AS A SIGNALIZED CROSSWALK ACROSS PCH IN MALIBU. IMPROVEMENTS TO AN EXISTING TRAIL NETWORK YNET IN NEWPORT SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC ACCESS AMENITIES INCLUDING BENCHES SIGNAGE BIKE RACKS EVEN BINOCULARS AND A PUBLIC LAND DONATIONS AND TO COMMITMENTS TO OPEN TRAIL SEGMENTS THAT WILL ADD MISSING PIECES TO THE COASTAL TRAIL. THE TAKE AWAY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY OF AUTHORITY IS PROVING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR RESOLVING MORE PUBLIC ACCESS CASES MORE QUICKLY. IT'S ENABLED COMMISSION STAFF IN THAT IT WILLING PARTIES TO RESOLVE VIOLATIONS WITHOUT FORMAL LEGAL ACTION WHICH SAVES EVERYONE TIME REMAINING AS A RESULT THE PUBLIC NOW IS ACCESS TO MORE COASTAL AREAS UP AND DOWN THE COAST. THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION WERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU OTHER STATISTICS ARE PRETTY REMARKABLE -- CONGRATULATIONS -- BUT YOU KNOW WE I REMEMBER WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY AND THERE WAS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TO WIN IT WOULD -- WE HAD A REALLY STRONG INDICATION THAT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL BUT DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE. THE SUCCESSFUL -- ONE OF THE PERHAPS SMALLER BUT VERY PERSISTENT VIOLATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS IS -- PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS PUTTING UP NO PARKING SIGNS IN THE LIKE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY -- IN AREAS WHERE THE PUBLIC IS -- A PERMITTED TO PARK -- THAT THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE TOUGHER TYPE OF VIOLATIONS BECAUSE IT. WHAT WANT TO RESOLVE THE VIOLATION SOMEBODY CAN QUIETLY -- I'M RESTORE THOSE SIGNS ARE WE SEEING MUCH OF THAT IS A SAD AN IMPACT IN THAT REGARD IT HAD A HUGE IMPACT THOSE KINDS OF SMALL VIOLATIONS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS THAT THEIR GAMBLING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SUE THEM OVER AND BY AND LARGE THEY WERE RIGHT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF VIOLATIONS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO PERSUADE THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO ARE VERY BUSY TO FILE A LAWSUIT JUST TO GET A SIGN. DOWN BUT WITH THIS NEW AUTHORITY WE'VE BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THEM DOWN AND THEN WE WRITE THEM A LETTER WE KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND IF THEY POP BACK UP AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE RECIDIVIST SIGNS. IS TO REAPPEAR WE JUST WRITE ANOTHER LETTER AND SAY THAT THE DAILY PENALTIES ARE RUNNING AND THE SECOND TIME IT'S A KNOWING AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS WAS EVEN EASIER. A PUBLIC A CASE. WHAT'S GREAT TO THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WELCOME EVERYONE WHY DON'T WE IF YOU DON'T -- MIND WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE WILL ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND TAKE CARE OF OUR VERY BRIEF BUSINESS ON THE VOTE ON THE CALENDAR. BLOOM. HERE FONG. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON. RAY YES. REVERSE. GREAT GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL WE ARE OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED NOW AND LET'S GO TO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR WE HAVE HAD A REQUEST -- TO VOTE ON ISSUES SEVEN SEPARATELY AND DOES SO IF WE COULD GET A MOTION ON ISSUES ONE THROUGH SIX ABOVE THE GREAT. BLOOM HI FONG. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON. REYES. REVERSE. TERRIFIC A IS THERE A MOTION ON ISSUE [inaudible] SEVEN SECOND THAT. AND WITH SO DO A ROLL CALL BLOOM I FONG [inaudible] GARCIA [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] RAY YES [inaudible] RIVAS. SO IF THERE'S SAID NAH NO FURTHER -- QUESTIONS ON THE INFORMATION ITEM THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO AN AFTER ISSUE TO WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES. ONE AND TWO WE ON ISSUE -- TO FRANKLY WE CAN GET A B. C. P. ON THIS -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS HAS TO DO WITH AN ISSUE -- THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO ALL OF US HERE WHO CARE ABOUT -- THE THE COST OF HOUSING WELL THE COST OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IS PRETTY HIGH TOO AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE AND SAN FRANCISCO. SO YOU KNOW MY PERSONAL OPINION ON THIS IS THAT THE INCREASE -- THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR GIVEN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET AND AND SAN FRANCISCO IS REASONABLE BUT AND I'VE MADE SURE THAT THIS IS ON THE AGENDA -- AND WE'RE KEEPING IT OPEN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T RECEIVE A BC PAY AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT WE WE SHOULD HAVE A B. C. P. ON I KNOW THAT -- THE COMMISSION'S BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO LA -- AND OTHERS SO THIS IS REALLY KIND OF JUST A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE CAN SAY THE CITIES ARE THE ORDER OF BUSINESS YEAR. YOU KNOW -- AND MISTRANSLATED SIR -- LA -- IT -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANY COMMENTS THERE'S THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE RELOCATION OF OUR OUR SAN FRANCISCO HEADQUARTERS OFFICE THANK YOU AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT -- THIS WAS OF COURSE NOT A FIRST CHOICE -- WE WANTED TO STAY IN OUR OFFICE LOCATION. WE ALL THOUGHT WE HAD INITIAL A VERBAL AGREEMENT FROM THE BUILDING OWNERS AT THE IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. YEAH BUT THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND AND DECIDED NOT TO IN A RELEASE WITH THE COMMISSION AND ANOTHER STATE AGENCY -- IN THE BUILDING. AND TO SAY THE LEAST THAT WAS INCREDIBLY UNPLEASANT SURPRISE BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO WE WORK CLOSELY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AN APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. TO FIND YOU OF OFFICE SPACE -- IT WITHIN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AS OUR CURRENT OFFICE LOCATION. AND STAYING IN THE VICINITY OF OUR CURRENT OFFICE LOCATION IS IN SAN FRANCISCO IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR OUR OPERATIONAL CAPACITY OF COMMISSION STAFF -- THIS. LOCATION ALLOWS -- EMPLOYEES TO USE A WIDE VARIETY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO WORK -- WE HAVE EMPLOYEES LIVE ALL OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND A TRANSIT OR WALK OR BIKE TO WORK. IT WAS CRITICAL TO KEEP THAT OFFICE LOCATION -- WERE. WERE THAT WAS POSSIBLE OR RETAIN AND ALSO RECRUITER CREATURE STAFF IT ALSO MEETS THE STATE GOALS IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY USING PUBLIC TRANSIT BIKING AND WALKING. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. THIS LOCATION IS ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR THE ACCESSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC WE SERVE FOR OUR PARTICULAR FOR NORTH CENTRAL DISTRICT OFFICE WHICH IS CO LOCATED WITH OUR WITH OUR HEADQUARTERS OFFICE. IN THAT DISTRICT OFFICE SERVES THE COUNTIES OF SAN MATTEO SAN FRANCISCO MARIN AND SONOMA COUNTIES. AND THE CITIES WITHIN THOSE THOSE COUNTY SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THAT ACCESSIBILITY IN OUR VIEW. THE COMMISSION'S 200-019-2000 -- TWENTY GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET INCLUDES THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION -- TO COVER MOVING AND CONSTRUCTION COST. IN ADDITION THE NEW OFFICE SPACE INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT CAN BE SUBLEASE TO ANOTHER STATE AGENCY AND BGS WILL BE -- WORKING ON ON THAT ISSUE -- IT WHEN THE NEW OFFICE SPACES COMPLETED. SO OUR LEASE TERM IS FOR AT TEN YEAR LEASE WITH THE SIX YEARS FUHRMAN FOR YOUR SOFT -- YEAH WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE MOVING IN AND THAT SEPTEMBER ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALL THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED AND SO -- WITH THAT. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU -- MY DAD WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL -- ALWAYS USED TO SAY GET IT IN WRITING. LISTEN TO MY DAD -- FINANCE. AVERAGE ELIO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- I THINK WE WOULD JUST ECHO THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE CHAIR THAT NOT GETTING OFF THE INFORMATION THROUGH THE FORMAL BUDGETING BCP PROCESS -- WAS A CONCERN FOR SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE BUT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN REALLY RESPONSIVE IN ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM MY USUAL THINGS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR LEASES THAT THEY ARE -- ENTERING INTO A LEASE FOR A LOT MORE SPACE THAN THEY NEED AND SO WILL NEED TO FIND A SUBCONTRACTOR -- SUBLEASE SEATED TAKE SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL SPACE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT PENCIL OUT FOR THE STATE - WHICH PROBABLY IS NOT A DEAL THE WAY WE WOULD WANT TO GO THINGS BUT GIVEN THE STATE OF OF REAL ESTATE IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS I THINK BONKERS IS PROBABLY THE TECHNICAL TERM. FOR FOR OR THE STATE THERE WITH THEY'VE THEY'VE SHOWN THAT THEY'VE DONE DUE DILIGENCE AND LOOKING AT LET OTHER -- FACILITIES AND AND LOCATION SO I THINK IT JUST WILL BE REALLY KEY TO GET ASSEMBLY SEE AND THERE TO HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THE MARKET IS BONKERS. THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM I GUESS I'M GOING TO PASS THAT ON TO ARE A REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FROM THE BAY AREA -- BUT IT'S BONKERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- TO DID -- FINANCE SEVENTY COMMENTS SURE ENTERED UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO -- JUST PUT A BIT BACKGROUNDS CONTACTS LAST YEAR'S PEACE IF HE WAS -- THE THE RESOURCES PROVIDED WERE FOR THE COST COMMISSION TO STAY IN THE FACILITY -- BECAUSE THERE. BEING FORCED TO VACATE THE FACILITY THIS FUNDING WILL -- PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THE NEW FACILITY -- LAST YEAR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WAS PROVIDED A KNOWLEDGE IN THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE REQUEST AND ALLOWED FOR CURRENT YEAR AUGMENTATION -- SO WHILE FORMAL BUDGETING PROPOSAL WAS NOT SUBMITTED THE INITIATION DID -- SMITH THIS PROPOSAL THROUGH AN ISSUE SPECIFIC BASELINE ADJUSTMENT BUT IN SAYING THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR CONCERNS AND AND GOING FORWARD I'M GOING FORWARD WE WILL -- HE THAT ADVICE THANK YOU. THAT -- A MYSTERIOUS. AMANDA MR MULLIN. I DON'T LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I KEEP MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE COST TO RENT. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT -- WHEN I SEE THE FACT THAT? THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE POINT THREE MILLION WAS ADDED FOR THE RENT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO AND NOW TO HAVE ONE POINT. FOUR ADDED ON TOP OF THAT. THAT CAUSES ME GREAT CONCERN. AND I HEAR THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE NEED TO BE CLOSE BY AND I HEAR THE EXPLANATION ABOUT. YOU KNOW THIS IS A COST. OF BEING IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO I RECOGNIZE IT'S CONVENIENT. FOR FOR FOR EMPLOYEES FOR STAFF BUT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AND TO HAVE IT MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM LAST YEAR. I I DO HAVE. SERIOUS CONCERNS A LOOK FURTHER INTO IT BUT I I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE THE THE THAT THERE WAS NOT IN WRITING. MY DAD DIDN'T TELL ME TO GET IN WRITING BUT IN LAW SCHOOL THEY TOLD ME YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU HAVE IT IN WRITING. SO IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN -- AND I WANTED TO BE SURE TO VOICE THEM AND MR TERRIFY BAY -- HALF OF THE COST IS FOR TEN IMPROVEMENT COSTS THOSE COSTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCURRED HAD BECAUSE COMMISSION BEEN ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT FACILITY -- SO THEY INCREASES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT THE FULL ONE POINT TWO BUT JUST ONE POINT UP. RIGHT THERE ARE NOT HAPPY. I DON'T THINK -- THAT IN NEGOTIATING -- THAT THE THE COMMISSION DID ANYTHING WRONG HERE WHEN I HAD MY LITTLE COMMENT ABOUT -- GETTING IT IN WRITING PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ARE ALWAYS VERBAL AND STE THEN YOU REACH A POINT WHERE YOU START. TO A REDUCE THINGS TO TO WRITING AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE IN THOSE PRELIMINARY STAGES YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AND THEN -- THE OWNER OF THE BUILDING OR THE LANDLORD FOR WHATEVER REASON DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RISING PCA. A PRICES IT SAID. IS THAT ESSENTIALLY CORRECT YES THAT'S RIGHT AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D ALSO NOTE BY STATUTE WERE REQUIRED TO BE OUR HEADQUARTERS OFFICES REQUIRED TO BE IN A COASTAL COUNT -- SO ANY OF OUR COASTAL AREAS. EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS OF COURSE SAN FRANCISCO IS BONKERS AND IT IS ALL HIGHER ANYWHERE WITHIN THE BAY AREA WE LOOKED AROUND OTHER OTHER AREAS -- IN AND IT WAS VERY COST PROHIBITIVE -- THE BUT IT AND SO I THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE ISSUES THERE BUT YOU KNOW PART OF MOST OF THAT IS FOR THE YOU KNOW A GOOD PART OF THIS IS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND MOVING COSTS. THANK YOU FOR THE REMINDER I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT THE THAT'S IN STATUTE -- EIGHT AND THAT YOU'RE HAVING SAID IT REMINDED ME I THINK I ASKED THAT EXACT QUESTION WHEN YOU CAME HERE -- OF FOR THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. MR MOE. THEY WERE SURE WITH THROUGH THEY WALK ME TO SAN MATEO COUNTY BUT AS YOU SAID. THE RENTS ARE -- MUCH BETTER ON THE PENINSULA IT'S THERE'S BEEN A A MAJOR RUN UP OF COURSE AND COSTS. AND I UNDERSTAND THE SYNERGIES OF BEING IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES BUT YOU'RE NOT THE NEW LOCATION IS NOT AT THE BAY AREA METRO CENTER OR IS IT. NOW BUT IT'S IN PROXIMITY I MEAN THERE'S UP TO HOLD THEIR OF ENTITIES BOB DID YOU PURSUE I'M JUST CURIOUS -- DID YOU PURSUE THE BAY AREA METRO CENTER FOR SPACERS THAT MAXED OUT. I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHEN BACK TO YOU ON THAT I I KNOW DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES LOOKED IN SAM TAIL MORAN OAKLAND EVEN WITH NO IN THE STATUTE -- NEEDING TO PANICLES COUNTY OAKLAND IS NOT -- BUT WE CAN GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE AND JUST CURIOUS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT -- THEN NOW WHEN WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES ONE AND TWO IS THERE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO OFFER COMMENT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE OTHER OF THEM DONE BEHALF OF US WHO LIVE NOT AMONG CALIFORNIA AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS -- BY THE CALIFORNIA COAST PROTECTION NETWORK AND SURFRIDER FOUNDATION -- SPECIFIC TO THE TO THE INFORMATIONAL ITEM ON ON COASTAL ACCESS AND AND THE ABILITY THE COMMISSION NOW TO TO EMPLOY THIS NEW TOOL ON THAT LEGISLATORS. THEM. TO ENSURE THAT THE COAST -- IS MADE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY -- ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE TRIED TO RESTRICT ACCESS -- THE VALUE OF THIS NEW TOOL FOR THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED -- ALTHOUGH THE ONE THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS IT RELATES TO THE BUDGET IS -- FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING WE ONLY HAVE ONE P. Y. AT THE COAST COMMISSION CURRENTLY WHOSE WHOSE PRIMARY JOB IS. TO PUT MORE WORK ON COASTAL ACCESS ISSUES AND WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE -- INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY ESPECIALLY NOW AS THE COST COMMISSION JUST ADOPTED A REALLY STELLAR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY -- A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AT AT THE AT THE LATEST HEARING -- WHICH WE KNOW IS GOING TO TAKE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT AS WELL -- SO WITH THAT ONE IN A TO RAISE THOSE. AND HIGHLIGHT THOSE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR -- THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. TO COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE WILL MOVE ON NOW -- TO ISSUE THREE COASTAL ADAPTATION AND NOW YOU'LL BE JOINED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. THE CDC WELCOME [inaudible] VERY MUCH. WELL I THINK ON THIS ISSUE WE WERE GOING TO START WITH A PRESENTATION BY THE ALEJO TO GIVE US KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF THE OF THE AREA. pEHLERS WITH THE LA -- SERGEANTS PASSING A HAND OUT FROM WHICH ALL SPEAK WHICH IS ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE -- SO STEADFAST IS TO GIVE JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW SINCE THIS IS KIND OF A CROSS CUTTING ISSUE OF WHAT THE STATE'S DOING ON COASTAL ADAPTATION ISSUES. SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE HIM I THINK IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED NOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING UP QUITE A BIT OF THREATS FROM THE RISK OF RISING SEAS -- AND TIDES. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OR WHEN BUT WE KNOW IT'S COMING -- THE RANGES HERE ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT -- WILL DEPEND ON ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVER THE COMING DECADES BUT WE SEE THAT EVEN AT THE MINIMAL LEVELS THEY WILL HAVE LARGE IMPACTS. THE HAVE IMPACTS OF COURSE A PROPERTY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO TO OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BEACH EROSION INTRUSION BREASTS SALT WATER INTRUSION INTO GROUNDWATER BASINS. HABITATS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE RISING SEAS BUT THAT EXACERBATED BY KING TIDES AND STORM SURGES WHICH WILL BRING -- AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN SOME RECENT STORMS -- PERIODIC IN ADDITION THAT WILL BE EQUALLY DAMAGING. SO THE STATE'S GOT MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY -- THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER WHICH IS GOOD NEWS -- BUT THEY DO EACH HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DIFFERENT AREA OF FOCUS THE COASTAL COMMISSION REGULATES THE USE OF LAND AND WATER IN THE COASTAL ZONE WHICH GENERALLY -- GOES FROM THEM MEAN HIGH TIDE LINE AND I THOUSAND YARDS UP INCLUDING THROUGH LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM -- PERMITTING WHICH I THINK YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT -- FROM THE DIRECTOR THE IT BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THAT'S THE SIMS IS GO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION BE CDC. WHICH REGULATES. DEVELOPMENT IN THE BAY -- AND IS ALSO HELPING TO COORDINATE SEA LEVEL RISE PLANNING EFFORTS THERE. THE COASTAL COMMISSION GENERALLY EXCUSE ME THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY -- GENERALLY IS FOCUSED ON ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS BOTH GIVING OUT GRANTS GENERALLY FROM STATE BOND FUND AS FOR PROJECTS AS WELL AS UNDERTAKING SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS THEMSELVES. THE OAKLAND PROTECTION COUNCIL PLEASE A COORDINATING ROLE AND UNDERTAKE SOME STATEWIDE EFFORTS LIKE DATA COLLECTION AND GUIDANCE. AND THEN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS OUR LANDLORD. ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US FOR PUBLIC TRUST A RESOURCES AND SAID THE SOVEREIGN STATE LANDS THE TIDELANDS AND SUBMERGED LANDS. SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FOR COASTAL ADAPTATION EFFORTS BOTH PLANNING AND PROJECTS -- THERE HAS BEEN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS PROVIDED IN THAT THE TABLE SHOWS THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THOSE G. G. R. F.. THERE ALSO HAS BEEN SOME FUNDING FROM BONDS AS WELL AS GENERAL FUND I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL THESE HAVE BEEN IN THE LOW MILLIONS -- CUMULATIVELY SO NOT TENS OF MILLIONS NOT MILLIONS BUT KIND OF ON THE ON THE LOWER END. OF MILLIONS -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY THERE ARE TWO ONGOING G. G. R. F. APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND BC DC YOU CAN SEE ON THE CHART. I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS TO EXPLAIN IN DETAIL HOW THEY'RE PROPOSING TO USE THAT FUNDS I WILL JUST NOTE -- THERE HAS BEEN FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THESE AGENCIES IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THOSE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND YEAR IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR PREVIOUSLY. AND THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED ON A ONE YEAR AT A TIME BASIS SO THIS IS A DIFFERENCE IN THAT IT'S COMING BEFORE YOU OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND FOR ON GOING -- FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION IT'S FOR TO CONTINUE THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR BE CDC HAS THEY'LL EXPLAIN IT'S IT'S MORE AND FOR THE IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. THERE IS NOT FUNDING AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE CHART PROPOSED FOR THAT BECAUSE OF CONSERVANCY THAT CLIMATE READY PROGRAM AS HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN PRE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- TURNING TO PAGE THREE JUST SOME CONSIDERATIONS WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU. IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT MOST OF THE PLANNING AND RESPONSE. RESPONSIBILITIES REALLY DO LIE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MOST OF THE PROPERTY IS EITHER OWNED BY PRIVATE ENTITIES ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. MOST OF THE DECISION MAKING OVER LAND USE POLICIES IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- SO PRIMARY FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IS ALSO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE STATE SHOULD JUST WIPE ITS HANDS AND WALK AWAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A HUGE STATE INTEREST IN. WHAT HAPPENS ALONG THE COAST AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- FROM HEALTH AND SAFETY PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT HAPPENS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE HUGE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC IMPACTS THERE WAS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT FROM THE? US GEOLOGICAL SERVICE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AT RISK IN PROPERTY ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST -- AND THEN THE STATE OWNS INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL HIGHWAYS OUR STATE BEACHES AND STATE PARKS ALONG THE COAST. AND WE ARE THE PUBLIC TRUST -- ENTITY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND AND PUBLIC ACCESS OF THE STATE SO -- VERY STRONG INTEREST IN THE STATE SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS -- REPRESENT IMPORTANT MEET IMPORTANT NEEDS -- OBVIOUSLY THE NEEDS ARE GREATER THAN THESE HOWEVER AND SO WELL WHAT WE WOULD WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT ALSO. REALLY STARTING TODAY AGAIN AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES GONNA NEED FROM THE STATE BOTH ON THE FISCAL SIDE AND HOW CAN STATE DOLLARS BE USED MOST EFFECTIVELY BUT ARE THERE POLICY CHANGES AS WELL THAT WILL HELP FACILITATE. THE HEAVY LEFT THAT WILL -- THAT IS FACING LOCAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES. SO ON THAT NOTE JUST TURNING TO PAGE -- FOUR I THINK YOUR STAFF HAS PUT THESE IN YOUR AGENDA AS WELL THESE ARE SOME KEY LEGISLATIVE QUESTIONS THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST -- YOU FOCUS ON NOT JUST TODAY BUT IN THE MONTHS AND THE YEARS TO COME. I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY KEY ONES THIS FIRST BILL IT WHAT IS THE STATE ROLE AS COMPARED TO THE LOCAL ROLE AND WHERE IS THE STATE RESPONSE AND WORK IN THE STATE PROVIDE THE GREATEST VALUE. AS COMPARED TO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOW IS PROGRESS BEING MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ARE THERE STATE ACTIONS THAT THAT THAT CAN HELP FACILITATE EITHER THREE CARATS ARTHUR STICKS? TO HELP ENSURE THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USES OF STATE FUNDING ON WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND ARE THERE ADDITIONAL -- TOOLS THAT MAYBE COULD BE USED AT THE STATE LEVEL OR THE LOCAL LEVEL TO GENERATE OR MAKE AVAILABLE ADDITION ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING. THE STATE HAS BEEN AND CAN CONTINUE TO BE HELPFUL IN PROVIDING DATA AND INFORMATION. FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TO HELP GUIDE THEIR PLANNING AND AS SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDINGS CHANGE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE DATA AND INFORMATION THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IS ALSO -- DEVELOPING ALONG WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING. THE STATE ASSETS THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR SURE -- WHAT WHAT WE OWN AND WHAT WE ARE IN CHARGE OF BOTH BUILDINGS BUT AGAIN ALSO OUR STATE PARKS AND STATE BEACHES AND ARE WE? ON TRACK FOR OUR PLANNING AND ADAPTING FOR THOSE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ASSETS ARE ARE PROTECTED. AND OR ADAPTING -- AND AND WHOSE. IN CHARGE OF THAT. WE HAVE COST ESTIMATES VERY MUCH THAT'S GONNA COST HAS FUNDING BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND THEN FINALLY THE FINAL BILL THAT ONE OF THE MAIN TOOLS THAT THE STATE HAS -- TO HELP AT BOTH. COMPELLED GUIDE AND ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS THROUGH THE COASTAL COMMISSION ADMINISTERED LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM PROCESS SO HOW IS THAT PROCESS GOING ARE THERE BARRIERS THAT ARE INHIBITING. LOCAL COMMUNITIES FROM MAKING PROGRESS THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT WE CAN HOW THAT THAT YOU ALL CAN HELP WITH -- AND AND HOW CAN WE IT HOW CAN WE USE THAT TOOL TO HELP -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY. SO CLOSE JUST BY SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING OUR OFFICE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS AND SO IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU THINK THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL AND AND MEETING YOUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND PLEASE BE IN DIALOGUE WITH. US ABOUT THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU -- DID FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO ADD. OF SOME TRICKLE BACK IN MISTER AINSWORTH -- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GONNA DIVIDE UP YOUR TIME I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU BUT I WONDERING -- IF AS YOU LAUNCH INTO THIS DISCUSSION WITH -- I I THINK WE AND THE LEGISLATURE HERE -- PERHAPS MORE THAN THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE AND WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE AROUND IT. THE LA -- HAS HAS A GIVEN US A NEAR TERM IT AT THAT TIME. AT TWENTY THIRTY ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE THAT WE MIGHT -- SEE THE SEA RISE -- AND THEN A TWENTY FIFTY ESTIMATE OF TWENTY ONE I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT NEAR TERM NUMBER. AND MAKE IT REAL FOR US WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND I MEAN GET OUT OF EROSION OKAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT CORROSION IS -- I UNDERSTAND WHAT FLOODING IS BUT GIVE US SOME CONTEXT FOR IF YOU IF YOU WILL. THAT'S AN YEARS AWAY AT ART ALL OF OUR I COULD START OFF WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THAT THAT NEAR TERM -- PROJECTION OF YOU KNOW UP TO TWO FEET WITH THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS [inaudible] THAT PROJECTION. YOU KNOW DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL THE STORM RELATED -- ASPECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED WHAT'S DRIVING SILVERS AND FLOODING FOR THE U. S. LIKE WILL THE USGS STUDY JUST CAME OUT REALLY ILLUSTRATES THIS WELL. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE AT RISK SPEAK WITH. AMPLIFIED STORMS DRIVEN BY HIS CLIMATE CHANGE ON TOP OF THESE OF SEAL RISE PROJECTIONS. AND WE GET A GLIMPSE OF THAT THROUGH OUR KING TIDES PROJECT WE SEE -- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING DATA AND ALL SORTS OF STORIES AND PHOTOGRAPHS IN DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS OF AREAS THAT ARE TO THAT TODAY. ARE INUNDATED COMMUNITIES ARE BEING INUNDATED BY KING TIDES ALONE IF YOU GET THAT ON TOP OF A A STORMS -- THE HUNDRED YEAR STORM HE CAN TALK A DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT WAY OFF IN THE FUTURE -- THESE ARE THESE ARE IT THESE ARE -- IMPACTS OUR CURRENT TODAY HAND GOING TO THE NEAR FUTURE. SALAS START OFF JUST WITH JUST A QUICK GENERAL OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE COMMISSION STEALING HERE. AS YOU KNOW. WE CALIFORNIA'S FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR COAST IN OCEAN ECONOMY AND OUR AN ARC COASTAL COMMUNITIES ARE AT SEVERE RISK FROM CLIMATE DRIVEN SILVA RISE. IT INVOLVES THE FLOODING INUNDATION EROSION A BALL AND A LOSS OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTIES. IN ONE RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION OVER TWO THIRDS OF OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES ALONG WILL BE LOST IN THOSE OUR SERVER ECONOMIC HEART AND SOUL OF OUR OUR FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. AND WITH EACH NEW STATE SEEMS TO COME OUT IT SEEMS THE PROJECTION SEEMS TO GET EVEN MORE GRIM AND SEES ARE RISING FASTER. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT THE COSTA COMMISSION -- AS THE LA -- POINTED OUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION -- PER YEAR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TO OUR BASE LINE BUDGET TO CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD AND THESE FUNDS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND OUR STAFF TO OVERSEE THESE GRANTS AND THESE UPDATES TO OUR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS. CAN OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE -- WE'VE AWARDED ALMOST SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THIRTY SEVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OUT OF OUR SEVENTY SIX LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALONG THE COAST. TO UPDATE THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PLANS OR L. CP'S DISASSEMBLY DRESSED THE THE RISKS. AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AND SILVER RISE AND PREPARE ADAPTATION PLANS TO ADDRESS THOSE RISK. THESE GRANTS OF FUNDED THIRTY THREE DRAFTER FINAL LC -- OF THE SEAL RISING CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. TWELVE DRAFT OR FINAL ADAPTATION REPORTS WE'VE AT THIRTY FIVE DRAFTER FINAL LCP DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN -- IN THE WORKS ARE COMPLETED. WE'VE CERTIFIED ACTUALLY TH -- SEVERAL -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS UPDATES EXAMPLE THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO -- CITY NEWPORT BEACH SAN CLEMENTE. SOLANO BEACH AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY OR SOME OF OUR RECENT -- THIS CATIONS. AND ADDITIONAL WORK IS UNDER WAY -- INCLUDING MOST RECENT GRANT BROWN TO OVER ROUND SIX GRANTS OF SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. NOW IS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE -- THESE ISSUES IS PLANNING ISSUES CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS SO WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NAVIGATE. THE L. C. P. -- PROCESS BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND POLICY GUIDANCE. AND HELP DEMYSTIFY AND THESE COMPETING SCIENTIFIC MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE THE COMMISSION ADOPTED ITS FORESEEABLE RISE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AN UPDATED LAST YEAR TO INCLUDE THE CURRENT -- SEAL VICE PROJECTIONS COMING OUT OF THE SCIENCE AT OPC HAD -- HAVE HAS DONE. STAFF IS ALSO WOULD -- IS DEVELOPING -- ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS FOCUSED ON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THESE DOCUMENTS TAKE A DEEPER DIVE THEY PROVIDE PRACTICAL SAMPLE POLICY LANGUAGE AND ADAPTATION PLANNING TOOLS TO HELP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEGIN THAT PLANNING PROCESS. IN THROUGHOUT ALL WE ARE COOPER WE ARE COORDINATING AND COLLABORATING WITH OUR WONDERFUL AGENCY PARTNERS BE DC COSTA CONSERVANCY. OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL STATE PARKS CALTRANS -- PIECE -- PR IN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION -- BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE THESE ISSUES. AN ADAPTATION IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY COSTLY. BUT IT PALES IN COMPARISON I THINK TO THE ENDLESS EMERGENCY RESPONSES -- BY -- BY -- BY AN ESTIMATE OF A FOUR TO ONE GRANT REQUESTS -- THAT WE RECEIVE CAN TRIM THE OUT CONTINUE TO OUTSTRIP THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WE RECEIVED ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT REQUEST FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. AND WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING -- OF COURSE. AND WE NEED TO DO THIS TO CREATE A A SAFE AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA COAST FOR OUR PRESENT FUTURE GENERATIONS -- BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- IT'S BEEN I OPENING IT'S BEEN A LITTLE MORE. DIFFICULT THAN WE ANTICIPATED AS WE GET INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS ONCE THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE ARE DONE. THE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOOK AT HIM AND SAY -- GOOD LORD NOW WHAT. NOW I GOT TO DO THE HARD LIFTING OF DEVELOPING POLICY SANITATION POLICIES. AND PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AT RISK. PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL AND THERE'S UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED THAT. AND THAT LEADS TO SOMETIMES ANGER. AND THE ANGER SOMETIMES DIRECTED AT US BECAUSE WE'RE DELIVERING A MESSAGE BUT I WANT TO SHARE THIS CASE THAT THIS COMMITTEE THAT. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS BECAUSE THE STRENGTH OF THE COASTAL ACT IS FOUNDED ON THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE TO CARRY OUT THE COASTAL LACK. SO THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN -- BACK OR DO YOU HAVE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER COMPACT HI LARRY GOLD BAND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CDC LET ME GO FIRST TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HEARING AND WE WANT TO VERY MUCH THANK THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS. CONFIDENCE IN BC DC MOVING FORWARD ON RISING SEA LEVEL -- WHEN WE LOOK TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROJECTIONS? WE BASICALLY FIGURE TWO FEET OF RISING SEA LEVELS BAKED IT. IF NOT IT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO NO MATTER WHAT GHG EMISSIONS HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FIFTY TWO FEET IS BAKED IT. WE TEND TO THINK MAYBE THREE FEET IS BAKED IN BECAUSE IT AIN'T GOING TO BE LOWER THAN TWO FEET THAT'S FOR SURE. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WE BASICALLY SAID LOOK AND THINK FOUR TO SEVEN FEET. MAY BE AS HIGH AS TEN ON THE OUTSIDE BUT CERTAINLY FOUR TO SEVEN FEET I PASSED OUT SOME PICTURES THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE THE PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT. MR MULLIN IS SEEING THEM WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT WHAT BC DC DOES AS WE PERMIT PROJECTS. IS WE HAVE RAISED WE ARE FORCED THOSE PROJECTS TO BE ELEVATED. SO IF YOU WALK ALONG THE SAN FRANCISCO EMBARCADERO YOU'LL SEE THAT AS THE NEW FERRY TERMINAL IS BEING BUILT IT IS AT A HIGHER ELEVATION DISTINCTLY HIGHER ELEVATION THAN THE OLD AGRICULTURE BUILDING NEXT TO IT. ENDED FOR YOU IF WE HAD PERMITTED IT NEARLY SIX MONTHS AGO INSTEAD OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE HIGHER STILL. BE CDC DIRECTLY PERMITS THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS LET ME KNOW ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS SAY AT THREE FEET BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET. IMAGINE THE BAY AREA AND IMAGINE THAT THE BAY IS A BIG BATHTUB. BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS IT'S A SHALLOW BATHTUB IT IS SURROUNDED BY HILLS. ON A SUNNY DAY WITH THREE FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A STORM THE STORM SURGE OR OR OR OR EN EL NINO. SFO ACCESS BASICALLY IS CLOSED OUT OF HIGHWAY ONE A ONE US ONE NO ONE IS GOING TO BE CLOSED AROUND SANDRA FELL INTO BRAUN. AND CERTAINLY AROUND SAN MATTEO AVENUE IN THAT AREA AND ALL -- HIGHWAY. THIRTY SEVEN BASICALLY GOING TO BE CLOSED IN VARIOUS POINTS. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT RAIL AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT BART IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A PARTS OF BARTON MAY WELL BE CLOSED? CERTAINLY YOU MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER. THAT A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE IS A FIVE YEAR STORM. THE EMBARCADERO AND MONTGOMERY MUNY STATIONS WERE CLOSED. SO YOU CAN SORT OF ENVISION THAT A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. WHICH IS DEFINED AS BEING ABLE TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE TO THERE BY USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION OR DIFFERENT ROADS IS GOING TO BE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY SAY THREE FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL. THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HOMES AND TO BUSINESSES. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT AT THREE FEET YOU MAY SEE AS MANY AS TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES. TAKING IN WATER AROUND THE BAY AREA. AND DOESN'T AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE BUSINESSES SUCH AS LAND DECKER YA WHO WERE DEL OR SEAGATE ALL OF WHOM WILL NO DOUBT SOMEHOW HAVE TO LOOK AT POSSIBLY GETTING WHACKED. THAT'S THREE FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL AT A STORM ADDED EL NINO AND YOU'RE RELEASING SOME KIND OF PATTERN THAT WE REALLY NEED THE PLAN AGAINST AND WE NEED TO PLAN -- FOR AND SO WHAT WE DO A. B. C. D. C.. IS. TO LEAD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN WORKING NOT ONLY ON THEIR OWN PLANS WITH OUR HELP AND WITH OUR DATA. BUT ALSO WORKING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THE BAY IS A NETWORK IN SO MANY WAYS. AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT THERE'S A REGIONAL SOLUTION FOR THIS SO THAT IF SAN MATTEO COUNTY. DECIDES TO BUILD SOMETHING WHETHER IT BE A LEVY OR WHETHER IT BE A WALL SOMEWHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS PUT INTO FOR EXAMPLE THE WHOLE REGIONAL CONTEXT. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WATER MOVES AND SO AND WE'VE ALL LEARNED THAT. MOVES TO SOME EXTENT NORTH. AND SO AS A RESULT BECAUSE WATER REFLEX WE NEED TO HAVE A REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLAN WHICH ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. ONE ASPECT OF RESILIENCE OVER HERE DOESN'T CAUSE FLOODING OVER THERE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE WITH THE G. G. R. F. FUNDS IN ADDITION TO BOLSTERING OUR STAFF WHICH HAS BEEN DOING RISING SEA LEVEL ON SMALL GRANTS THAT ARE SHORT TERM. AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DOZEN YEARS WILL ACTUALLY BE SUPPORTED ALMOST FULLY BY THE STATE. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TO OUR ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES PROGRAM IS CREATING WITH CALTRANS AND WITH THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THE FIRST EVER FULL SCALE VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS? OF THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AROUND. THE BAY. AND IN MANY RESPECTS THAT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK NOW SERVES AS DE FACTO FLOOD PROTECTION ONE OH ONE AND THE OTHER AND THE OTHER IN AND MAJOR ROADS LITERALLY ARE. DE FACTO FLOOD PROTECTION BUT WHAT BC DC IS DOING IS MORPHING THAT KIND OF VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS TO OUR ADAPTING RISING TIDES PROGRAM THIS YEAR. AND MOVING IT INTO A REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLANNED PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO AS WE START THAT FRAMEWORK THIS YEAR IS TO FINISH THAT FRAMEWORK BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT DATE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US AND THE REASON THAT DATES IMPORTANT. IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEXT TIME THAT A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY PLAN BAY AREA WILL ACTUALLY COME TO THE FORE. AND WE NEED THAT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH. OUR REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLAN. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO FIT TOGETHER THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THIS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF EACH OTHER BUT THEY NEED TO BE A LINE. AND THAT'S WHY THESE FUNDS ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR US SO WE LOOK AT THIS REGIONALLY AND WE HAVE AN EASIER JOB THAN JACK IN ONE RESPECT BECAUSE OUR REGION IS VERY MUCH SORT OF SELF CONTAINED. BUT ALSO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE BAY SHORELINE AND THIS IS HOW ALL AND THERE IS EVERYTHING FROM HOUSES. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN MANY RESPECTS TO LARGE SCALE INDUSTRY TO AGRICULTURE OPEN SPACE PARKS AND THE LIKE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ADAPTATION PLAN CAN ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THAT. LET ME FINISH BY SAYING THIS IS THE TEXAS COASTAL PLAINS. GOES FROM BASICALLY LOUISIANA DOWN TOWARD COPE CORPUS CHRISTI. THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE RIGHT ON THE COAST IN THAT AREA AT LEAST COMPARED TO THE BAY AREA THERE APPEARED SOME CERTAINLY. AND MOST OF HOUSTON OF COURSE YOU'RE MEMBERS INLAND ALTHOUGH GALVESTON ISN'T. THIS TOOK THEM A FEW YEARS TO MAKE AND IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT NATURE. IMAGINE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WITH THE REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLAN THAT DEALS WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE BAY SHORE LINE. IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MR MALL. JUST A COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY ISSUE AS A MATTER OF FACT I WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR -- FOR PAINTING THE PICTURE HERE AND AND ILLUSTRATING. A THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AND AT THE RISK OF STATING THE OBVIOUS THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION WHILE I WELCOME IT -- IT THAT CAN'T BE VIEWED. AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BASELINE. FOR WHAT WE HAVE COMING AT US -- IN TERMS OF THIS CHALLENGE SO -- I WELCOME THE COLLABORATION AMONG THAT THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND I'D WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT INUNDATIONS OWN IN THE BAY JUST TO SEE WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND AND THE LEVEL OF CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY LEVEL RISE AND ALSO -- RESILIENCY EFFORTS AN ADAPTATION EFFORTS ON OUR COAST WERE GETTING IT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE COASTAL SIDE AND THE BAYSIDE SO. IMMENSE CHALLENGES BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING PROACTIVE HER WELCOME THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BEFORE WE ACTUALLY CAST A VOTE ON THIS THING I'D. LOVE TO SEE IT MAYBE A HIGHER NUMBER BUT THIS IS REALLY A MULTI YEAR GENERATIONAL KIND OF A THING AND I I WELCOME -- THE CHAIRS -- POINTED INTEREST -- IN THIS ISSUE AS WELL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WHY DON'T WE -- MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE SECOND THIRTY PUBLIC COMMENT. EXCITED. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE SELLER GONZALEZ WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING TEACHER OUT FUNDING OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. OUT ALSO JUST LIKE TO THINK THAT LEO FOR REFERENCING THE USGS DATA THERE IS A LA TIMES ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO THAT. GIVES A PRETTY GOOD SUMMARY AND REFERENCES ALL OF THOSE -- POINTS THAT WERE MADE TNC HAS WORKED WITH US YES ON SOME OF THOSE MODELS SO WE'D BE INTERESTED OR AND ABLE TOPROVIDE STAFF WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AGAIN AND FOR OTHER THAN THE ON BEHALF OF US WHO WILL AND I'M ON CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO BEEN ASKED TO SEE MY COMMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE PROTECTION AT WORK. I'M THREE THREE POINTS TO MAKE WHAT ONE ON THE FUNDING WANT TO DEFINITELY ECHO THE THE POINT RAISED BY MY BY SOMEONE MULLIN -- ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL NEED FOR FUNDING AND AS THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT ALL THE COASTAL AGENCIES OUTLINED IN IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE AGENDA PLEASE ME -- ARE THE CRITICAL AGENCIES BUT ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONE THIRD OF OUR COASTLINE IS ACTUALLY OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE PARKS SO I THINK. KEEPING THEM IN CONSIDERATION AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS BEING CONSIDERED IS ALSO GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE TO TO ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON THIS -- COLLECTIVELY -- THE THE SECOND PIECE IS REALLY ABOUT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR I KNOW WE OFTEN CAN CAN CONSIDER THAT JUST BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS ARE THE ONES THAT LIVE ON THE COAST. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE POCKETS ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH BAY OR ALONG THAT THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE YOU DO HAVE A VERY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- THERE ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE JUST GIVEN THAT AND THAT AND SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS -- SO REALLY WANTING TO TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS A AS A PRIORITY MOVING FORWARD AND SUBSCRIPTION AND THEN FINALLY WANT TO SAY -- REALLY WANTED TO TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS AS WE PUT THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK THIS RELATES BACK TO THE THE FIRST ITEM ON COASTAL ACCESS -- BECAUSE WE IF WE END UP DEFAULTING OR ALLOWING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TO DEFAULT TO THE HARDENING AND SEA WALLS AND RIPRAP. A WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS ON THE DECENT BEACHES SO YOU END UP LOSING A LOT OF THE SANDY BEACH AREAS AS A RESULT -- THAT ARE WHERE AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WANT TO BE WILL GO TO RETREAT AND ACCESS THE COASTLINE -- SO WITH THAT AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMING. HI JENNIFER SAVAGE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION A LETTER TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE REMARKS THAT WE JUST MADE A SURFRIDER AKAS EVERYTHING. ALONG THOSE LINES WE AT WORK ON THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY WE KNOW THAT THE LEVEL RISES AN EXPONENTIAL THREAT NOT ONLY TO OUR URBAN AREAS ARE ECONOMY.

AND I'LL I'LL START IT OFF AND TURN IT OVER TO FILL -- THE WHAT MAKES THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION -- SO UNIQUE AS THE STATE'S LANDLORD AS WAS EARLIER REFERENCE -- REFERENCE IS THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO -- STARTS WITH THE POINT ON THE GROUND ARE THE STATE'S OWNERSHIP AND A LOT OF THAT -- INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE OWNERS THAT OWNERSHIP DATES BACK PRIOR TO STATEHOOD AND SO WHEN WE GET REQUESTS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE'S OWNERSHIP IS IN CERTAIN TIED IN SOMERS LANDS ARE NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS. WERE ON A DAILY BASIS ACCESSING HISTORICAL RECORDS THAT DATE BACK PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY AND THEN MOVING THROUGH TIME -- AS THAT LAND OWNERSHIP OF ALL TO AND APPLYING BOTH THE FAX TO THE GROUND AS WELL AS THE LAN HOW THAT -- OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN -- LEGALLY INTERPRETED OVER THE YEARS. AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IN HOUSE IS MANUALLY WE HAVE A MANUAL TITLE PLANT -- THAT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE STATE'S OWNERSHIP AND WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES IS IT BRINGS US IN -- TO THAT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL STAGE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE MAJORITY OF THAT RESEARCH AND ANALYTICAL WORK -- USING -- GIS AND THE SYSTEM -- AT TO HELP -- SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND THEN -- ALSO AT THE END PART OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TURN THIS INTO A PUBLIC FACE SEEN -- WEB APPLICATION SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS THEIR HISTORICAL RECORDS MORE DIRECTLY. PHIL DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT -- I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT AND WE USE THOSE MAPS AND DOCUMENTS AS WORK PRODUCT AND THAT'S TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THOSE RECORDS THAT ARE KIND OF A REPLACEABLE AND SO. MAKING THEM DIGITAL IS YOU KNOW THE WAY TO PRESERVE THEM FOR YOU KNOW OUR OUR FUTURE NEEDS AND AND USES -- ANOTHER ANOTHER PIECE I WOULD ADD IS THE SYSTEM IS ARCHITECTED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BOWL STAFF AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS IT FROM A CENTRAL SOURCE -- AND SO THAT THAT'S GIVING US A LOT OF EFFICIENCY -- WITH WITH THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU A MISTER FONG WHICH OF COURSE. OF I APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER AB MATCH AS SHE GENTLY CURIOUS IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU PUT THE PROJECT TOGETHER DO YOU DID YOU USE.

RAPID IMPLEMENTATION TIME FOR HIM DID YOU FEEL THAT WAS. RELATIVELY EASIER BECAUSE YOU'RE USING OFF THE SHELF -- THINGS THAT WERE -- A READILY AVAILABLE RIGHT YEAH IT DAY BASICALLY TO YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE INITIAL LEAD TIMES AND AND STANDING UP THAT THE TYPICAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE -- YOU KNOW BASICALLY WHERE WERE ABLE TO SKIP RIGHT OVER THAT AND GET RIGHT INTO BUILDING BUILDING THE SOLUTION CORRECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S GREAT -- BUT THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS SIR PUBLIC COMMENT. NO PUBLIC COMMENT SO -- WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM TO APPROVE AS BUDGET IT IS OUR MOTION. TO HEAR SECOND. MOTION A SECOND. BLOOM I FONG. GARCIA MULLIN. PERCENT. RADIUS REVERSE [inaudible] YES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU SHOULD THE REPORT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND WILL MOVE ON TO DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. WE HAVE [inaudible] FIVE FIVE ITEMS TO COVER WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER WE'VE HEARD THE OTHER REPORT ON ALL OF THESE ITEMS AND TO WALK. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE IF I MIGHT I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OPENING REMARKS OF COURSE ANY PLACE FROM THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION -- FOR THE BUDGET I'M LEAST MARKET ON THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR MAKES VERY STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN STATE PARKS WHILE MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE SIGNATURE INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND PROVIDED THE ORGANIZATION -- THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE NEW POSITIONS -- TO HELP STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS THROUGH THAT WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER -- PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES AUGMENT OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ALSO ON FIXING OUR PARKS BY AUGMENTING OUR MAINTENANCE EFFORTS AND THAT INCLUDES A REST DISABILITIES VISITOR CENTERS ROADS TRAILS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WATER SYSTEMS THAT COMES. COME TO MIND THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR US TO SERVE THE VISITORS -- WE LAUNCHED A RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN CALLED LIFT THE PARKS LIFE. AND WE ARE TRYING TO RETHINK AND RETOOL HOW WE RECRUIT AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE BY PARTICIPATING IN A VAST NETWORK OF PARTNERS. AND REACHING -- FAR MORE COMMUNITIES THAN WE EVER HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT TO REACHING -- TALENTED INDIVIDUALS FROM ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL COME AND JOIN US TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD AND ONE TIME FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THIS BUILDS UPON THE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED POSITIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED US LAST YEAR FOR ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND IT ALSO BUILDS UPON THE ROUGHLY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN ONE TIME FUNDING THAT YOU PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO PRIORITIZE THOSE PROJECTS WHEN -- WE'VE GOT A ROUGHLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FIELD WE WORK ON THAT AT SOME POINTS WITH SOME OTHER PARTNERS AND OPERATORS AND WE HELP DETERMINE A PRIOR TO A PRIORITIZED LIST. ON TYPICALLY WE'VE WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HEALTH AND SAFETY WATER SYSTEMS ANTIQUATED ROOFS ROADS -- WE ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW ON DEVELOPING A LIST THAT WILL BE PRESENTING TO YOU SHORTLY SHARING WITH YOU AND I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THINGS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS -- THAT WE'VE TARGETED. LASTLY -- WE CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION. SIXTY EIGHT PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT INCLUDE SOME OF THE STRONGEST LANGUAGE FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED IN FOCUS FOR PART POOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ACCESS -- TO PARKS IN THE ECOSYSTEM OF PARKS NOT JUST STATE PARKS BUT LOCAL PARKS ALL LANDS IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL -- FOR THRIVING NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE. WHEN WE LAUNCHED OUR EFFORTS WE BEGAN THROUGH A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WE DEVELOP -- POLICIES AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL HELP DETERMINE HOW THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. ON WE ARE WRAPPING UP THAT PROCESS WERE VERY PLEASED BY THE OUT THE THE ATTENDANCE AND THE ENGAGEMENT OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THAT -- IN CLOSING I GUESS I WOULD SHARE THAT ARE INVESTMENT PARKS IS REALLY HAVE AN EXPRESSION OF OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES WE'VE YOU CALIFORNIA PARKS IS REALLY A STATEMENT OF WHAT WE DEEM -- TO BE NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT'S OUR COMMITMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT THINGS THINGS ARE WORTHY OF PROTECTION. AND SO WITH THAT -- I'LL OPEN UP TO ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR I CAN DIVE RIGHT INTO THE NEXT ISSUE. HI I'M NOT SEEN ENHANCE GO UP -- TO MR FONG. I'M I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING AND AND THE THE PUBLIC INPUT YOUR GATHERING I WOULD WANT TO ASK JUST BECAUSE THE OF THE HEADLINE TODAY ABOUT THE THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS GUY OUT -- AND READING THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF YOUR INTERACTION I I DON'T I DON'T I BELIEVE YOU'RE KIND OF TAKING AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO AND DOOR WITH THIS GAS I WAS ONE OF YOU JUST. SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE JUST YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH IMPLEMENTING THIS GALLON AND IN JUST ANY INSIGHT YOU CAN PROVIDE US SO MAYBE I CAN SUGGEST THAT YOU DIVE RIGHT INTO ISSUE FIVE OH I'M SORRY IT'S COVERED IN FIVE AND ANSWER THE QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF OF OTHER MARCHING AGAINST. ON THAT ISSUE THAT ALL RIGHT APPRECIATE THAT YEAH SORRY FOR A JOB THAT ORDER MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAPPEN TO BE HAPPY TO DO THAT SO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA IS THAT VERY ISSUE -- SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ON GOING FOR TWELVE POSITIONS. TO ADDRESS SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE MIGRATION -- TO THE STATE WIDE FISCAL SYSTEM WE ACTUALLY -- STARTED THIS MIGRATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IT'S BEEN NO EASY FEAT -- BUT WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD I THINK MUCH OF KIND OF WHAT WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WERE FACING SOME OF THEM I WOULD SAY WERE IN THE BUCKET OF THINGS THAT WE ANTICIPATED. AND SOME OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY LESSONS LEARNED WE'RE FAIRLY UNIQUE DEPARTMENT LAW I KNOW EVERY DEPARTMENT THINKS THAT ABOUT THEMSELVES WHAT MAKES A SOMEWHAT UNIQUELY CHALLENGED AS THE VOLUME OF FUNDS THAT WE HAVE. WE ALSO COLLECT REVENUES -- WE ALSO MAKE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PAYMENTS TO VENDORS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'RE NOT LOCATED IN LARGE URBAN AREAS WITH MANY MANY MANY VENDORS. BUT WERE OFTEN REMOTELY LOCATED WHERE THE NUMBER OF VENDORS ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED SO BEING ABLE TO MAKE TIMELY PAYMENT TO THE VENDORS ARE REALLY KEY. I'M GONNA SHARE -- SOME STATISTICS WITH YOU -- THAT KIND OF MAKE US A LITTLE MORE UNIQUELY POSITIONED RELATIVE TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS -- I WOULD SAY. WELL WELL FIRST I SHOULD SAME YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THE MIGRATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I THINK WE WE TREAT ALL OF THE WORKLOAD AS IT WAS AS IF IT WAS GONNA BE ONE TIME IN NATURE BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY PREMATURE. TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH OF THIS WOULD BE ON GOING SO WE RESPONDED. IN A ONE TIME NATURE WE HIRED TEMPORARY STAFF WE ASKED OUR STAFF TO KIND OF RISE TO THE OCCASION AND DO OVERTIME SORRY ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS SERVICES STAFF DID OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF OVERTIME. TYPICALLY PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS UNDERSTANDS THAT WE EXPECT OVER TIME BUT THAT THERE'S A SEASONALITY TO IT AND WE'VE NOT SEEN A SEASONALITY THAT THIS IS A CONTINUE TO STAND LEVEL OF OVERTIME. WE ALSO -- TREATED THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT -- WE HAD FOLKS OUT IN THE FIELD AND OUT IN OUR TWENTY ONE DISTRICTS -- INCLUDING PEOPLE IN HEADQUARTERS -- SHARING IN RE DIRECTING STAFF TO ALSO HELP AUGMENT THIS EFFORT. SO I THINK WELL THAT WAS A REALLY SMART WAY TO APPROACH THIS AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE NEAR TERM WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME KIND OF THE THEIR GROWING BACKLOG OF WORK LET THAT WE HAVE. WE ALSO NOT ONLY DO THE BUDGET FOR OUR OWN ORGANIZATION THE DEPARTMENT PARKS AND RECREATION BUT WE ALSO PRODUCE THE BUDGET AND THE FISCAL ON INFORMATION. FOR THREE SMALLER CONSERVANCY'S -- THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY CONSERVANCY IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY MOUNTAINS SO THAT ALSO -- PROVIDES A LAYER OF COMPLEXITY SO IN TERMS OF NO WE ALSO CREATED SOME INTERNAL DATABASES THAT HELP TO KIND OF AUTOMATE SOME THINGS. SO IT'S A COMBINATION IN TERMS OF THE ON GOING RECORD ITS COMBINATION OF TRACKING SOME THINGS THAT IN THE PAST WE HADN'T TRACK BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO MEET A HIGHER STANDARD OF ACCOUNTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW. AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY BUT THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY THAT THERE WERE SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WE MAY HAVE DONE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR QUARTERLY BASIS OR A MONTHLY BASIS. THAT NOW WE'RE HAVING TO DO ON A DAILY BASIS WEEKLY BASIS AND WE'RE HAVING TO DO THE MORE FREQUENTLY -- SO I THINK IN THE LONG TERM I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT YOU'RE KIND OF CATCHING US RIGHT IN NOT RIGHT IN THAT KIND OF MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WERE FIGURING THIS OUT. THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY I MUST SAY WE DID NOT PRESENT THIS TO YOU LIGHTLY -- OR APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIGHTLY -- THIS REQUEST IS INTENDED TO BE A NOT A FACT OF SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A ONE TIME WORKLOAD DECLINING. AND THEN WITH THE NOT A FACT OF WHAT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE ON GOING WORKLOAD. IF I MAY FOLLOW UP -- I APPRECIATE THE THE INFORMATION ARE YOU PROVIDING THAT AS IS FISCALE OPEN TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. AS AS THE BEING UNIQUE AGENCY AB I I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT. UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE NOT UNIQUE IN THE IN THE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FISCAL WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THE AND THEIR DIFFICULTIES AS WELL SO ARE YOU ARE YOU. IS FISCAL ASKING YOU FOR YOUR INPUT AND HOW TO IMPROVE AND ARE THEY LISTENING -- YES I THINK BEFORE WE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THE MIGRATION THERE WAS A LOT OF STAFF COLLABORATION -- I CAN SAY EVEN MYSELF I'M NOT A SHY DIRECTOR AND I COME FROM A BIT OF IT IN MINISTRY OF IN FISCAL BACKGROUND SO I WASN'T SIGNED JUMPING ON MYSELF. AND ATTENDING SOME OF THE MEETINGS WE ACTUALLY KIND OF HAD ON GOING ON MEETINGS WERE FISCAL STAFF FOR EMBEDDED WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I CAN TELL IS EVERYONE'S WORKING WELL TOGETHER IS THAT WHEN I STEP IN AND ATTEND SOME OF THOSE MEETINGS EVERYBODY KNOWS EACH OTHER HOW MANY KIDS EACH OTHER HAS. YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME -- INITIALLY WHEN WE WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE MIGRATION I ALSO WAS HAVING. YOU KNOW ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS WITH US SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM THERE AT THE FIFTH CAL DEPARTMENT SO -- I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY ENGAGED I FEEL LIKE -- THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY RESPONSIVE -- TO REALLY KIND OF FLAGGING AND TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE WRINKLES AND SO THIS IS A RESULT OF YOU KNOW THIS IS THE RESULT OF YEARS OF COLLABORATION WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM -- THIS IS NOT A STARTING POINT FOR CONVERSATION WITH THEM. OKAY I PUSHED IN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE AYE AYE. AYE AYE AYE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT TO HEAR IT AS AS KIM I'M TRYING TO IT'S INTERESTING TO JUXTAPOSE. THE LAST IT PROJECT THAT WE HAD THAT WAS HEARD FROM -- THEY USE OFF THE SHELF TECHNOLOGY AND IS NOW UNDER BUDGET AND ON TIME AND FISCALE AND THEIR CHALLENGES THE FACT THAT NOW YOU YOU'VE HAD TO CREATE YOUR OWN INTERNAL DATABASES WHICH I HOPE INTERFACE. WITH NOT ONLY VIZQUEL BUT WITH ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH AS WE HEARD WITH THE PREVIOUS TESTIMNY OF STATE PARKS IN THE ROLE WITH THE COST OF COMMISSION AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME SYNERGY THERE AND MY FEAR IS THAT. WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES WITH THE ID PROJECTS IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA THAT WE DON'T MAKE THOSE SAME MISTAKES I THAT YOU HAVE TO IN DOOR AND BE THE PICK THEM UP SO I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THANK YOU MUCH INSTRUMENT. THANK YOU. THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON ISSUE -- FIVE DO WE HAVE THE LA OVER FINANCE COMMENTS AND LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX THE INDIAN HERITAGE. CENTER STAFFING. THE TERM THIS CITING PROJECT ON THIS ISSUE WE'RE REQUESTING FOR NINE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THREE POSITIONS TO PATROL MAINTAINED. AND DEVELOP THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CENTER SO JUST -- BY WAY OF SOME CONTEXT YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE WERE BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR AND YOU APPROVED -- A PROPOSAL TO BUILD A NEW CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE CULTURAL CENTRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IT'S IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE IT'S GOING TO REPLACE A VERY ANTIQUATED -- INDIAN MUSEUM THAT WE HAVE CO LOCATED AT SUTTER'S FORT WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE GIVEN THE COMPLICATED HISTORY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN -- PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC THEY WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH -- THE GOVERNOR'S TRIBAL ADVISER CRISTINA SNYDER -- SHE'S BEEN IN VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY -- OUR HOPE IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO TAKE THE RESOURCES THAT YOU PROVIDED US LAST YEAR TO ALSO EXPAND THAT THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORTS -- WHEN WE LAST SPOKE TO YOU WE STATED THAT OUR INTENTION WAS TO SITE THIS? SITE THAT WAS LOCATED BUT WAS STOPPED BY A TIE A TASK FORCE ON THAT WAS ORIGINALLY STAB US RELATIVE TO THIS PROJECT THAT SHOWS A LOCATION AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE TWO RIVERS. IN THE CITY OF LOS SACRAMENTO AT THE TIME THAT WE SPOKE TO YOU LAST YEAR WE HAD NOT OF FINALIZE THE SECURING THE SECURING OF THAT PROPERTY WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CITY OF AUSTIN WAS SACRAMENTO. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE THAT PROPERTY ON AT THE TIME THAT WE PRESENTED TO YOU LAST YEAR WE KNEW THAT WE MIGHT NEED SOME INITIAL RESOURCES BUT IT WAS OUR INTENT AND WE DID -- DISCUSSED WITH THE CITY OF THE WEST SACRAMENTO POSSIBLY SOME SORT OF PARTNERSHIP WHERE THEY COULD ADDRESS OF THIS INITIAL WORKLOAD WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN THAT SO WE HEAR BEFORE YOU. THESE RESOURCES ALLOW US TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR IF YOU GO TO THE SITE IT'S NOT A REMOTE LOCATION IT'S EMBEDDED RIGHT THERE WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY [inaudible] GREAT -- ISSUE. SEVEN ISSUE SEVEN AS THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM IF YOU'VE NOT BEEN TO THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM IT'S A MUSEUM LOCATED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IT WAS BUILT WITH THE INTENTION TO SHOWCASE A LOT OF THE COLLECTION -- OF THE STATE ARCHIVIST WE ALSO PARTNER VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM TO SHOWCASE MANY OF THE COLLECTIONS THAT ARE UNDER OUR STEWARDSHIP ON HERE -- UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS -- IT'S NOT. GENERALLY HOW THIS WOULD WORK IS THIS IS A MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND OUR DEPARTMENT WOULD REALLY SERVE JUST AS A PASS THROUGH IN THIS MONEY WOULD GO FROM US TO THE CALIFORNIA MUSEUM CONSISTENT WITH. HOW WE'VE APPROACH SIMILAR APPROPRIATIONS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION IN THE PAST THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING REQUESTED? IS FOR INITIALLY TO CELEBRATE THE ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT AND GENDER JUSTICE AND SO THAT WOULD BE A CENTENNIAL EXHIBIT BUT THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN -- FOR THEY THEN A PLAN TO USE IT FOR PERMANENT EXHIBIT SHOWCASING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS SIR ISSUE EIGHT PLEASE. ISSUE WAIT THE REPLACEMENT OF SPECIALIZED EMERGENCY MOBILE EQUIPMENT. SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL OR PROVIDE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND DURING THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW US TO PROCURE FOR A SURF RESCUE VESSELS. A FIXED WING AIRCRAFT FOR ANSWER BREAK GO AND ALSO A FIRE FIGHTING APPARATUS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A FIRE TRUCK FOR HEARST CASTLE SO I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT THIS MEANS -- I THINK THAT THERE'S A HEIGHTENED SENSE OF AWARENESS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE RECENT DISASTERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS PLAYS IN THE IN THE OVERALL SAFETY NET IN COMMUNITIES -- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OF THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT -- THE WATER RESCUE VESSELS ARE NOT JUST YOUR TYPICAL VOTES THEY HAVE DEEP DEEP V. HOLD VESSELS SO THAT THEY CAN GO INTO. SURF -- AT WITHOUT CAPSIZING WHERE TYPICAL BOATS COULD NOT GO WE DO -- WITH THE FOUR VESSELS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE DO OVER A THOUSAND RESCUES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. WE'VE GOT A PREMIER LIFEGUARD PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- AS TRAINING AMAZING LIFEGUARDS IT ALSO HAS TWO ENGINES THAT ALLOWS IT TO PIVOT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES OF THESE ARE VERY UNIQUE. ON THESE VESSELS TO SAY THAT THEIR OLD IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT -- I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR OLDEST VESSEL IS THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD -- SO I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME THAT WE MADE THAT PURCHASE WITH THE IN THE OTHER VESSELS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD -- THE FIXED WING AIRPLANE WE HAVE AN AIRPLANE THAT'S A THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD -- OUT AN ANSWER BREAK OUT INTO A BREAK -- IS THE LARGEST STATE PARK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE SALTON SEA IN AN AREA AKA TEAL WELLS AND WERE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SAFETY NETWORK AND IT ALLOWS US TO PATROL. VAST AREAS IN -- SOME PRETTY HARSH -- CIRCUMSTANCES AND BOATS ARE REQUEST. THANK YOU I AM OUR LAST ISSUE IS. NINE ISSUE NUMBER -- NINE THIS IS A LIST OF OUR VARIOUS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT FOR CENTER TO YOU TODAY.

TO ENSURE THEY REMAIN PROTECTED AND PRESERVED AND ALSO ENSURE THAT THEIR ADEQUATELY IN SUSTAINABLY FUNDED -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE MANY OF THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING WITHIN IT A LINE WITH THESE -- PRIORITIES SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO OUR STATE PARKS AS WELL AS ENHANCED VISITOR EXPERIENCES TO THESE PLACES. ARE THAT'S DEMONSTRATED THROUGH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT INVESTMENT OF FUNDS AS WELL AS THE FORT ROSS CULTURAL TRAIL THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED THAT WILL NOT ONLY. TELL THE STORY OF THESE LANDS BUT ALSO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS -- AND FINALLY MOST NOTABLY THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIFTEEN CABINS THAT TRULY DO -- INCREASE LOW COST COASTAL COMBINATIONS TELLS CALIFORNIANS WHO WE KNOW WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO ENJOY THESE THESE EXPERIENCES.

THE MORNING TO THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS D. ON WEST. HI I'M WITH THE OUTDOOR OUR REGION IN THE PARKS NOW COALITION -- MY SPECIFIC POSITION WITHOUT OUR OUR REACH IS THE YOUTH PROGRAMS AND OUTDOOR VOICES COORDINATOR WHERE MY JOB IS TO CONNECT -- SAN DIEGO USED TO THE OUTDOORS SO I GREW UP IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHERE THERE ARE FEW ACCESSIBLE OUTDOOR SPACES. AND LIKE OTHER PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY I WAS NOT THAT INVESTED I IN THE OUTDOORS -- BOTH MY PARENTS WORKED FULL TIME JOBS AND THERE WAS JUST NO ONE TO TAKE ME OUT ANYWHERE I JUST TO GO OUTSIDE HOWEVER THAT WOULD LATER CHANGE WHEN I BECAME A PARTICIPANT WITHOUT -- OUTRAGE AT MY HIGH SCHOOL WHERE THEY EXPOSED ME TO DIFFERENT OUTDOOR SPACES AND ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD THEN LEAD TO A STRONG. CONNECTION BEING DEVELOPED BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE OUTDOORS I'M MORE SPECIFICALLY OUR STATE PARKS. ALL RIGHT -- I REMEMBER MY FIRST TIME GOING SURFING ACTIVITY THAT WE TEACH AT OUR ORGANIZATION WHERE I HAD A REMEMBER LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TIME AIDS CURRENTS AND WILDLIFE THAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE -- WHILE DOING THIS ACTIVITY AND I THAT WAS LIFE CHANGING FOR ME IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE FROM MY COMMUNITY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE TEACH THEM HOW TO GO SURFING. I GET ON THE EQUIPMENT -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP NOW COMING FULL CIRCLE ASSN INSTRUCTOR. ARE OUT IT IS AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR OTHER YOUTH IN SAN DIEGO. WHO ARE IN THE SAME SHOES I WAS IN NOT TOO LONG AGO -- YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE. MILLIONS OF YOUTH WHO LACK THAT CONNECTION TO THE OUTDOORS -- AND THAT LACK OF A MEANINGFUL CONNECTION MEANS THAT -- THERE'S AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF KIDS WHO LACK THE EXPERIENCE IS NEEDED -- TO PROTECT ADVOCATE AND FIGHT FOR THESE OUTDOOR SPACES I WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND FOR THAT REASON -- I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH THE PARKS NOW COALITION -- TO ADVOCATE FOR THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT SO THAT PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER OUT REACH CAN CONTINUE -- TO BUILD CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUTH AND THE OUTDOORS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RECALL MUSTER THE NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE PARKS NOW COALITION AS WELL. BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE STATE Y. PARK PROGRAM -- AND AS ONE OF THE PREVIOUS US SPEAKERS MENTIONED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. IN TERMS OF EQUITY AN OUT REACH AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT HAS REALLY BEEN TREMENDOUS -- WE WORK IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S STILL A HUGE DISPARITY OF INCOME. AND ACCESS THE PARKS THEIR DIRECT CORRELATION. SO AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID THIS IS A VERY INSPIRING STORY THIS IS WHY WE DO OUT REACH TO THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THAT THOSE GENERATIONS THOSE KIDS. GET THAT EXPERIENCE BECOME FUTURE LEADERS AND AND I JUST WANNA SAY IT'S INSPIRING TO HEAR THAT STORY AND SUPPORT THE ON GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU SO MUCH -- YOU KNOW FOR FOR HAVING THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION -- MY NAME IS SAMI NONIUS I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FATHERS OF FAMILIES OF SAN JOAQUIN.

BY PROVIDING SAFE WILL MAINTAIN PARKS AND PUBLIC SPACES PRESERVING OPEN SPACE AND HISTORIC RESOURCES CARING FOR PEOPLE STRENGTHENING THE BONDS OF COMMUNITY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU'LL. GROWTH ENRICHMENT. I WANT TO JUST SAY -- I'M REALLY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATION WILL BOTH THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AS WELL AS THE PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT -- STOCKTON IS THE LARGE METROPOLITAN CITY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ABOUT IT WAS A PUBLIC PARK SYSTEM. WHICH WAS REALLY THE ABANDONMENT OF OUR PEOPLE -- AND AND BECAUSE OF THE THE RED LINING HISTORIC REDLINING -- AND DESPAIR TREATMENT I WE'RE ALSO THE PLACE WAS FUNNY LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNNY HA HA BUT IT WAS. KIND OF IRONIC IN A CRUEL IRONY I FIND MYSELF KIND OF INTERESTED BY THE CONVERSATION AROUND THIS LEASE. AND THE HUB OF THAT BOND THAT WAS BUNKERS THE LEASE. AND MAJED WHERE THE PLACE WHERE GENTRIFICATION WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING GENTRIFIED FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BAY THE WAY TO BAY AREA ARE AND THE NOT. AND SO IMAGINE HOW BONKERS IT IS FOR OUR FAMILIES TO ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO A THE REGION THAT'S AN HOUR AWAY OR NOT HAVE PUBLIC PARKS -- SO WHERE THE CALIFORNIANS THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR BABY SWEAR WE ARE ELDERS CAN BE RESPECTED. OUR FAMILIES CAN BE CONNECTED AND OUR CHILDREN CAN BE PROTECTED BY PROTECTING THESE PUBLIC SPACES WHAT FAMILIES GO TO HEAL.

HI -- I AM YOUR MONEY COME SURELY AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CO FOUNDER BROWN GIRL SIR. AND IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURFING WAS DECLARED CALIFORNIA'S STATE SPORT. HOWEVER IF YOU VISIT THE MANY SURF BREAKS ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST OF PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS. YOU WILL RARELY SEE THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANS PEOPLE REPRESENTED IN THE WATER -- THE CLASSIC IMAGE OF A CALIFORNIA SURFER REMAINS WHITE AND MALE AND THERE ARE COMPLEX REASONS MANY ROOTED IN STRUCTURAL RACISM AND EXCLUSION. FOR THIS LACK OF REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR IN THE WATER -- BUT THE DEFAULT ASSUMPTION THIS CREATES FOR COMMUNITIES IS THAT WE DON'T BELONG -- ROUND GROCER OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS TO CHANGE THIS BY HELPING GIRLS AND WOMEN OF COLOR CONNECT TO THE CALIFORNIA COAST. AND THE SPORT OF SURFING IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THEY SEE THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES REPRESENTED. ONE YOUNG WOMAN WROTE TO US AFTER PROGRAM I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE IN CAPS NEVER PLAYED IN THE WATER IT LIKE I DID TODAY AND NEVER HAVE I EVER BEEN IN WATER WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU HAVE TRANSFORMED ME. BROWN GROCER RELIES ON FUNDING FROM THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY EXPLORE THE COAST PROGRAM TO KEEP OUR PROGRAMS RUNNING. WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY OF WELL MAINTAINED PARKS BUT OF TARGETED SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. I SUPPORT THE BUDGET ITEMS -- ALLOCATED TOWARDS LOW COST COASTAL ACCOMMODATION AND I URGE YOU TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT BUT CONSIDER INCREASING ALLOCATION FOR THE EXPLORE THE COAST PROGRAM OF THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JUSTIN CORNING FONG AND I AM A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ORGANIZATION BROWN GROCER -- BUNGLE SURF WORKS -- TO CONNECT -- GIRLS AND WOMEN PARTICULARLY GIRLS AND WOMEN OF COLOR TO THE OCEAN. AND I I'D REALLY LIKE TO MENTION THAT AS A CHILD AS A YOUNGER CHILD -- I DID A LOT OF IMAGINING OF WHAT I WANT THE FUTURE TO BE LIKE. AND IT REALLY WAS NOT UNTIL I MET AND FOUND BROWN RESEARCH THAT I CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT. I'M ON THE WAY OVER HERE MY SERVING INSTRUCTOR MERA ASKED ME WHAT MIGHT ONE OF MY FAVORITE EXPERIENCES WAS. WITH PROGRESS THERE. AND INSTANTLY WHAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS THAT THIS RITUAL WE DO TO GET READY FOR SURFING AND WHICH WE ALL HOLD HANDS AND GOING TO THE WATER TOGETHER WITH THEIR PORTS ON THE SHORE. THOUGH SOME OF US HAVE NEVER LIKE BEEN IN THE WATER BEFORE AND SOME OF US HAVE BEEN SERVING FOR YEARS WE ALL STAND THERE TOGETHER AND ARE PAYING FOR A GIRL SERVE RASH GUARDS -- AND THIS MOMENT PARTICULARLY REMINDS ME OF THE POWER OF UNITY AND THE POWER AND UNITY [inaudible] AND WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE THING IN ITSELF -- THE PROBLEM WITH CONVERSATIONS REGARDING ACCESS IS THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT FIGHT AND STRIVE FOR SOMETHING YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH. AND SO IN TILL I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER BROWN GIRL SIR. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS MISSING AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE GREATLY OF KNOWLEDGE AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT ACCESS. AND WHEN WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS I'M STARTING BUDGET THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GINGER QUIT US I AM HERE REPRESENTING BROWN GIRL SERVE AS WELL -- VOLUNTEER SURF INSTRUCTOR AND TRANSPORTATION TEAM. I HAVE COME TO YOU GUYS TODAY THIS MORNING ALL THE WAY FROM EAST OAKLAND CALIFORNIA -- I'VE I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I CAN ALSO AGREE WITH A FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND ONE OF THEM WAS COMMUNITY. ANOTHER WAS HEALING RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN DESPERATE TIMES TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH GIVING ACCESS TO OUR ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING OUR COAST PEOPLE. WERE GOING TO INHERIT THIS PLANET AFTER WE ARE LONG GONE. IT'S A SUPER IMPORTANT FOR US TO STAND TOGETHER. AND PROVIDE ENOUGH BUDGET TO THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES SO THAT. KIDS LIKE MYSELF WILL COME FROM THESE NEIGHBORHOODS -- CAN CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND LEAVE BEHIND OF JUST AN AMAZING PLANET FOR OUR YOUTH AND OUR CHILDREN GOING FORWARD -- SO WE STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSITION AND THE BUDGET AND DO PLEAD FOR ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION OF BUDGETING AS WELL. I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE WAY THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN HEAL OUR YOUTH. AND BECAUSE OF THESE INCREDIBLY TRYING TIMES THAT WE'RE IN SPECIFICALLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. I DO ASK THAT EVERYONE IN HERE NOT ONLY CONSIDER THE BUDGET IN THE PROP BUT ALSO CONSIDER RESEARCHING OUR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE AND SEEING HOW YOU COULD POTENTIALLY SUPPORTED -- OUR PARKS OR SUPER IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL THIS IS WHERE WE CONVENE FOR COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE OUR BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND THINGS AND AM YOU KNOW WHERE OUR KIDS CAN GO AND PLAY SAFELY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. WITHOUT THAT WE HAVE NO HOPE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS ANTHONY ROBINSON JUNIOR I AM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE EQUITY ORGANIZED A FATHER THE FAMILY SAM WALKING. I AM ALSO FORMALLY INCARCERATED. RESIDENT OF STOCK IN CALIFORNIA WHO AT THIRTY EIGHT HAD NEVER BEEN TO A BEACH. NEVER BEEN TO A COASTAL REGION NEVER BEEN TO A NATIONAL PARK. NOW I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SPACES ARE THESE AREAS LET ME FROM THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT ON THE TABLE TODAY IS RECOGNIZING THAT COMMUNITIES IN WHICH I LEAVE COME FROM AND WORKING IN? HOW WE PLAY AND HOW WE PRAY? THERE'S AN ANALOGY THERE. RIGHT SO HOW ARE WE SETTING UP PARKS AS CIVIC ENGAGEMENTS HOW WE SEVEN PARK THERE SO SUGGEST THE SPACES WHERE I COMMUNITIES CAN COME TOGETHER AND POSITIVE WAYS AND PROSOCIAL WAYS. AND REHABILITATIVE WAYS AND HAVE THAT CONNECTION TO NATURE HAVE A CONNECTION TO THEMSELVES HAVE A CONNECTION TO HIM. SO A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL MARGINALIZE IN THESE COMMUNITIES I WITH MARGINALIZED MYSELF AND I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT áREA COLE WAS WERE REAL ENDEMIC. MIKE MY GOAL WITHIN REACH BEYOND A STREET CORNER MY GOAL IS TO REACH BEYOND A BOT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BEACH. SO MANY MOUSE FROM STOCKTON THAT'S WHAT THE STATE AND STOCKING SO A LOT OF TIMES WILL BE GIVE A COMMITTEES ACCESS OUTSIDE OF THE MARGIN OF WHICH THERE THINKING. BACK I THINK BIGGER I CAN SAY THAT I HAVE A MORE. EXPECT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND OWNERSHIP OF THE WORLD IN WHICH I'M LIVING HERE. RIGHT SO -- HOW TO UTILIZE PARKS AS RESOURCES HOW DO WE ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES A WAY WAS INTERESTING THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE PUTTING UP SIGNS BY WE KNOW THE GYM SEE? TAMAKI PEOPLE OUT. AND ONE OF THE CONNECTION THAT I MADE IS SOMEONE RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF THE PUBLIC SPACES OF THESE RECREATIONAL SPACES. AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY RECOGNIZE IT AND NOW YOU WANT TO KEEP IT AND L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G GRABBED A&lt;/c&gt; KNIFE AND SALES. TRYING TO KEEP SOME COMMUNITIES ON THE DECLARE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RIGHT GET SOME COMMITTEE THEY'RE NOT NOTED EIGHTY SIZE ARE ILLEGAL. RIGHT SO THEY GET HERE TOMORROW THE OTHER WAS A DELIGHT WHEN WE HAVE ACCESS TO SO IT IS IS THE SAME RIGHT. THE SPACE IN PLACE THAT WOULD KIND OF FACE WHICH WAS SOME IS LIGHTLY ON A NOTICE ON BECAUSE THEY A GREW UP IN A MORE FLUIDS TO SAY I HAVE MORE RIGHT. TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD WE ON THE SAME ARE I HAVE A MORE RIGHT TO RECREATION I HAVE MORE RIGHT TO PLAY AND PRAYER AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO CONTINUE TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING I LIKE THAT THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING JUST THINKING OF HOW PARK. IS SOCIAL EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE HOW PART IS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WE GOT A LOT OF TIME WE WALK BY A PARK OR YOU DRIVE BY A PART. AND YOU SEE THE COMMUNITY PLAN AND APART YOU CAN KIND OF I'LL CONSIDER COMMUNITY DO WAY I'LL. WE KNOW IT IS ALSO EXAMPLES WHERE WE SWAP BY WE SEE PARKS AND PEOPLE ARE ON THE ISSUES AND AND AND IS ALSO WORK TO DO AND AND APPS MADE BUT WE NEED MORE. RECREATIONAL PROSOCIAL SPACES AS PART AND WE NEED TO THINK OF IT AS THAT. SO THANK YOU OFFER THAT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUBCOMMITTEE -- THREE MY NAME IS LESTER DUNCAN ON THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS WITH A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN SAN DIEGO CALLED OUTDOOR OUTREACH -- AND IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT -- I'D LIKE TO INVITE EACH IF YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR JUST A FEW SECONDS. I'M ACTUALLY STILL THIS ACTIVITY FROM A COLLEAGUE OF MINE -- BUT I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE YOUR FIRST THE MOST MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE AND OUTDOORS. WHEN SHOULD IMAGINE THE SITES YOU SAW? THE SMELLS BUT YOU TOOK AND THE THINGS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TOUCH. THE WILDLIFE THAT YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE THE SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT YOU MAY HAVE FELT. WHILE BEING THERE. JUST KIND OF GO THERE WITH ME FIRST ACT. SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY ONE OF MY FIRST MOST FIRST THE MOST MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES IN THE OUTDOORS WAS IN MY ADULT LIFE. CLIMBING MOUNT ST HIS CENTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. I REMEMBER GETTING TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN LOOKING OUT OVER THE DESERT LOOKING OUT OVER THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND IMAGINING THAT ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE. AS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION OUTDOOR OUT REACH CREATES THESE EXPERIENCES -- EACH YEAR FOR OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED YOU AND THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF FROM THE PARKS NOW COALITION OF CREATE THOSE SAME EXPERIENCES FOR YOUTH ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED -- YOUTH YOUTH THAT ARE AT RISK OF A HOST OF INDICATORS IN WHICH YOU YOU ADDRESS AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEETINGS -- AND IN THE LEGISLATURE. BY CREATING MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE THE OUTDOORS WE'RE NOT ONLY BUILDING ANOTHER GENERATION OF CONSERVATIONISTS THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF AND THAT WILL STEWART OUR LANDS. WERE ALSO HELPING TO BUILD THE HEALTH THE WELL BEING AND THE RESILIENCE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND SO FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON OUTDOOR OUT REACH -- PROBABLY STANDS WITH THE PARKS NOW COALITION -- TO REALLY ADVOCATE FOR INTO PUSH SPECIALLY FOR THE CAN FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FUNDING TO MAKE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS POSSIBLE FOR COMMUNITIES AND FOR INDIVIDUALS. THAT MAY OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE.

THANK YOU AND I DON'T THINK -- YOU'LL TAKE THIS AS AN INSULT TO DIRECTOR BANG IT -- SOMETIMES THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS MORE INTERESTING OR AT LEAST AS INTERESTING AND HELPFUL AS AS AS THE PRESENTATIONS THAT WE GET FROM DEPARTMENTS IN THIS I THINK -- WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE MY FIRST EXPERIENCE BY THE WAY I AT LEAST THAT I CAN RECALL WAS HIKING IN THE EATON CANYON AREA OF ABOVE -- AL TO DEAN -- NEAR WHERE I GREW UP AS A YOUNG PERSON IN MY MOST RECENT -- I THOUGHT WELL FIRST.

OF WE HAVE -- AS A TRULY -- EXTRAORDINARY -- VARIETY -- AND AND AND VOLUME OF RESOURCES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE I THINK -- WITH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TRULY BLESSED TO HAVE AND IT'S PARTLY HISTORICAL BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO THE EAST COAST -- LOT OF THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PARKS ARE PRIVATELY OWNED BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF THOSE AREAS IS SO MUCH BETTER WE DO. HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERY COULD NOT JUST SADDAM BUT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS.

BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BEACH IS ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMUNITY BUT OUR PARKS. DOESN'T BELONG TO THE STATE TO BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. OF THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT. IT MEANS NOTHING IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING -- I LIKE THE COMMENT OF THE GENTLEMAN FROM. OF THE FATHERS OF SAN JOAQUIN I'M SORRY DON'T HAVE THIS THE TITLE.

PROBABLY MY TEEN YEARS BUT WE WENT TO THE PARK ON A REGULAR BASIS. THAT WAS OUR OUTING - TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A PARK AND SPEND TIME WITH FAMILY AND EXTENDED FAMILY -- ARE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES MUST BE BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD BECAUSE IF WE DON'T SUCCEED IN THAT WE ARE LEAVING GENERATIONS BEHIND. AND THAT'S WHY SEE YOU HERE SAID RECOMMENDS SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. BECAUSE YOU DO THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES YOU MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INCLUDED AND THAT WOULD PLANS FOR PARKS ARE DONE.

SIR BRIAN KAREM WITH THE THE REAR NOW COASTAL DIVISION BUT USED TO BE THE SOUTHERN DIVISION. OUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PLAN WILL BE REPLACING IT WITH WORK WITH C. H. P.

IT'SGOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK WITH OKAY PROBABLY FIRE AND C. H. P. OKAY I REASON I ASK IS -- CHAIR OF THE AVIATION CAUCUS -- BY CAMERA BIPARTISAN. INTERESTED IN A LOT OF THE AVIATION DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE HERE WE TALKED ABOUT HELICOPTERS. FOR CAL FIRE WITH TALKED ABOUT THE C.

ARE HUGELY DESTRUCTIVE TO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IN ADDITION TO THE AGRICULTURAL CROPS IT'S SO THE WORK OF WHAT OUR PLANT DIVISION CAN -- TO TO ERADICATE NOXIOUS INVASIVE WEEDS REALLY WILL HELP PROTECT OUR BIO DIVERSITY IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL PARKS AND ITS LANDSCAPE WHICH INCLUDES I THINK BEAUTIFUL ACT LAND. BUT ALSO WE'RE BIODIVERSITY HOT SPOT BUT IT WON'T STAY THAT WAY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE FOR NOT MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT. THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE ACROSS ALL DIVISIONS THE STATE GOVERNMENT. TO PARTNER WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT WE DO IN PUBLIC SPACES TO PRESERVE OUR NATURAL BIO DIVERSITY. THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A CALIFORNIA BIO DIVERSITY INITIATIVE WORK GROUP WHICH IS PROPOSED TO BE CO CHAIRED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL AS THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. WE LOOK TOWARDS ACCELERATING AND STREAMLINING THE PREVENTION DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES AND PASS. EXPANDING SEED AND GERM PLASM BANKING AS A HEDGE AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL PERMANENT LOSS OF NATIVE PLANT BIODIVERSITY. AND ESTABLISHING A SOIL CARBON MAP OF CALIFORNIA. DUE TO OUR AGRICULTURAL ORIENTED MISSION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING PLANT DIAGNOSTICS LAB. AND WE'RE STAFF WITH UNIQUE EXPERTISE IN SEAT IDENTIFICATION SEAT PHYSIOLOGY AND SEE QUALITY ASSESSMENT [inaudible] CDFA INTENDS TO CONTRIBUTE ITS EXPERTISE AND TO COLLABORATE OF OTHER DIVISIONS ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT. AS WELL AS ACADEMIA AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR THERE ARE MANY AREAS THAT HAVE STARTED TO DO THESE KINDS OF COLLECTIONS WE DO NOT WANT TO DUPLICATE ANYTHING THAT'S BEING DONE. BUT WE DO WANT TO BRING OUR EXPERTISE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ACCELERATE THESE COLLECTIONS TO MAKE SURE. WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN THIS GENERATION. TO PRESERVE OUR NATIVE BIODIVERSITY SO THAT IT'S AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND KEEP AT THE UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL SPOT. YES. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. MS REST THIS IS WHERE I HAD THE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T DUPLICATION IF WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA PLANT RESCUE PROGRAM. IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE THE BET ON BANKING THE SEEDS -- AND THEY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE OF THE ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR HOW. HOW WILL YOU ENSURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DUPLICATING THEIR EFFORTS SO OUR STAFF IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A CONVENING WITH THE FOLKS WITH BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT -- BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS IDENTIFYING WHAT'S IN THE WORKS WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE DUPLICATING THAT EFFORT BUT THAT WERE ENHANCING AT BRINGING IT TOGETHER. AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WHERE OUR EXPERTISE AT THE PLANT LAB IN PARTICULAR CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AND PERHAPS ACCELERATE THAT WORK THAT WERE IN A POSITION TO DO THAT. BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO DUPLICATE NONE OF US HAVE EXTRA RESOURCES TO WASTE. THAT IS TRUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE AND RIGHT AFTER -- ISSUE FOURTEEN IS HEARD TO AND SO WHEN WE LAUNCH RIGHT INTO ISSUE ELEVEN ISSUE ELEVEN WHICH IS OUR CITRUS PASSED AND DISEASE PREVENTION. I'M OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT. ON THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND TO FORTY AND TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AN ACCENT AUTHORITY. AS WELL AS SIXTY FIVE POSITIONS AND FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M GOING TO BUILD A DEDICATED CITRUS PASSED AND DISEASE PREVENTION DIVISION WITHIN CDFA TO ENHANCE OUR ASIAN TO SELL IT AND LONG LONG BEING. DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION AND RATIFICATION ACTIVITIES. THE ONE LONG BEING AS WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. IS THE MOST DEVASTATING OF ALL STITCHES DISEASES IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN OTHER NATIONS HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA'S HAD DEVASTATING MPACTS WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THUS FAR IN KEEPING THE DISEASE OUT OF OUR COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM. TO GIVE US ENOUGH TIME FOR THE RESEARCH TO FIND THE REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE DISEASE. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE -- AND THE THE PROCESS REST OF OUR PROGRAM. THAT WE REALLY WILL BE BEST SERVED BY HAVING A DEDICATED CITRUS DIVISION. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HANDLE THE FINES THAT WERE HAVING. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE TRAINED EXCLUSIVELY AND CITRUS DISEASE RESPONSE. AND NOT MOVING PEOPLE FROM OTHER EMERGENCY PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON VAST WHICH MAKES US VULNERABLE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND TAKES RAMP UP TIME TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND INTO THE TRAINING -- THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE CITRUS WELL IT'S NOT OUR LARGEST PROP IT IS OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND AS A PART OF OUR HISTORY IT'S AN ICONIC GOODWILL AMBASSADOR TO THE WORLD ARE FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL AND TASTY. AS WELL AS NUTRITIOUS ADDRESS. SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD -- WE HAVE HAD IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SOME ONE TIME INVESTMENTS IN THIS PROGRAM WHICH OF REALLY HELPED US. ON REALLY -- IMPROVING OUR DIAGNOSTICS FOR RAPID DETECTION AND THEN GOING OUT AND BEING ABLE TO REPLICATE ONCE WE GET A TIME WE NOW HAVE ALMOST TWELVE HUNDRED TREES THAT ARE POSITIVE. THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A PRETTY CONFINED AREA AND THE SOUTHERN LA BASIN AREA -- AND AND WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THOSE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IS DO THE PLANNING. AND HIRING OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD ON THAT ONE TIME EXPENDITURES MAKE IT VERY CHALLENGING TO DO THE ADEQUATE KIND OF PLANNING. THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND THE INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SO WE FEEL THAT WITH THIS REQUEST THIS YEAR WERE IN THE BEST POSITION WE HAVE BEEN. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DEDICATED DIVISION DEVOTED TO THE CITRUS DISEASE PROGRAM. IT'S GREAT -- TO IT IS -- I THINK OF A PRESSING ISSUE AND I'M. GLAD THAT WERE A REORGANIZING AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TO OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS PLEASE RATES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M SURE THE TROOPS ALL THE LETTER OF THE OPPOSING LETTER BUT NOT SO MUCH OPPOSING WHICH REQUESTING BUT EXPRESSING A REAL CONCERN ABOUT -- THE PESTICIDE SPECIFICALLY -- M.. AND THE EFFECT ON OUR HONEY BEES. IN IN MY PARTICULAR REGION HONEY BEES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I'M SURE THERE ARE EVER WORLD -- ONE OF THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS -- THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT AT THE LOOKED AT SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE THE PESTICIDES SO THEY DON'T AFFECTED NOT -- NOT ONLY THAT THE LAND BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER BENEFICIAL SAP THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I HAVE NOT SEEN THE LETTER BUT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO BE ASKING BECAUSE ONE OF THAT THE PROCESS IS THAT WE GO THROUGH WHEN WE HAVE A FIND OF AN INVASIVE PASSED. IS THAT WE WANT TO A RATHER IT IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT EXTENSIVE PESTICIDE USE IF IT WERE TO BECOME INFESTED. AND THEN HAVE TO BE A PART OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL FARMERS PEST MANAGEMENT WITCHY. SO OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THERE ARE MANY STEPS WE TAKE AS A RESULT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE TO COVER THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. IT'S ALL ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT WE FIRST LOOK AT HOW DO WE NOT DOWN THE IMMEDIATE POPULATION. WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US CAN IT BE MECHANICAL LIKE? UP PULLING OUT A TREE OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT ARE BIOLOGICAL AS WELL AS CHEMICAL WHAT ARE THE SOFTEST TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE AND STILL GET A RESULT? TO KEEP THE INFESTATION FROM SPREADING TO LARGER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SO WE GO THROUGH THOSE I PM PROCESSES. EARLY IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A PROLONGED INFESTATION AND THIS IS -- CURT WITH OUR CITRUS DISEASE PROGRAM ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DO ON RESEARCH IS TO START TO IDENTIFY BIOLOGICALS WHAT ARE BENEFICIAL PASS. NORMALLY WE HAVE TO GO OUT TO AREAS OF ORIGIN I BELIEVE THIS PARTICULAR WHAT'S CAME FROM PAKISTAN. SO IT TAKES TIME TO DEPLOY PEOPLE TO GO TO WHERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND IT BENEFICIAL. THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN MAKE SURE THAT GOES THROUGH THE STEPS TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T PROVIDE. ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THEN DO BREEDING CYCLES TO HAVE ENOUGH TO RUN PILOT PROGRAMS. SO WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EARLY ON A LOT OF THIS WORK HAPPENED WITH PEOPLE FROM UC RIVERSIDE -- THAT SPECIALIZE IN AND GOING TO THESE AREAS OF ORIGIN TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING TO WORK WE HAVE A WASP IT'S CALLED TAMARIX SCEA. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEPLOY -- EXTENSIVELY I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR WE HAVE REARED AND RELEASED OVER THREE MILLION OF THESE WASP AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND OVER THE LIFETIME THAT WE'VE HAD THESE WHAT'S IN THE BREEDING CYCLES FOR DEPLOYMENT. WE'VE RELEASED OVER ELEVEN MILLION SINCE THE INCEPTION OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. WE ALSO CONSTANTLY COME BACK AND CHECK TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AS WELL AS FOR US WE REALLY NEED TO CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE ESTABLISHED AND THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WHICH IS THIS BENEFICIAL LAST. TAKING CARE OF OF THE ASIAN SIT JUST SELL IT. AND WE HAVE -- FOUND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TERRORISTS YET OVER EIGHTY LOCATIONS SO THAT SHOWS IS THAT WE HAVE A BENEFICIAL THAT'S BECOMING ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK THIS INVASIVE PASSED THE ASIAN CITRUS SELECT. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE WE'VE DONE THIS FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS FARM THAT FLIGHT PROGRAM. WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO THIRTY YEARS AGO WE USE HELICOPTERS TO FLY MALATHION? HAPPY TO SAY WE'VE MOVED PAST THOSE DAYS WITH STERILE RELEASE OF MED FLIES SO THAT ON ANY GIVEN WEEK WE'RE RELEASING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION STERILE MED FLIES -- TO BREED IF THERE IS AN INFESTATION THAT INFESTATION OUT OF THAT CYCLE THEY FLY OVER AT ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND FEET SO WE'VE LEARNED FROM ALL OF OUR PROGRAM SO THAT IF WE FIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED INFESTATION WE CAN BEGIN THAT KIND OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH IMMEDIATELY. HAD TO COST YES. YES MA'AM. THAT'S A LOT OF STERILE MED FLIES A LOT LOT OF LOS. YEAH I AM. I HAVE AN ALLERGY TO US WITH A THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A NIGHTMARE THERE HAD DISCUSSION -- BUT THE LEASING THIS -- WE SEEM THEY SEE P. SHOW UP IN MY DISTRICT AND SPREAD AND SO MY CONSTITUENTS ARE DEFINITELY PAYING ATTENTION AND CONCERNED -- FOR THEIR OWN CONSUMPTION MUCH LESS WELL I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE TO OUR BIGGER AGRICULTURAL. COMMUNITY OUT THERE WE'VE SEEN TREES THAT ARE BEING UPROOTED AN ANIMATIC HATED IN THE MOMENT BUT THE STATE HAS CONTINUED AND SO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH ALONG THE WAY BUT WERE YOU SIGNALED IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. WE WE GET THIS UNDER CONTROL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO IT'S IT'S STARTED IN ONE OF MY CITIES TONIGHT IN MULTIPLE OF MY CITIES UNTIL. NEIGHBORS ARE DEFINITELY A LITTLE FREAKED OUT ABOUT THEIR TREES LEVY IN -- AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S A SMALLER PART OF THE WORRY THAT WE HAVE ON IN THIS ECOSYSTEM. AND SO ON I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WELL I PREFER THEN BIOLOGICALS THAT WERE YOU SEEN EVERYTHING AND ARE DISPOSABLE TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND WE THEN REALLY PUT AT REST THE BIGGER AGRICULTURAL. MARKET THAT WE HAVE THAT'S AND PUT INTO ECONOMY HERE. AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- YOU KNOW RULE IN IRVINE CALIFORNIA ARE SO INTER CONNECTED AND INTERDEPENDENT BUT MANY OF THESE INFESTATIONS DO OCCUR IN AN URBAN SETTING. AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO GOOD COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH AND CONSULTATION IN TOWN HALL MEETINGS -- SO THAT ARE URBAN NEIGHBORS AND CONSUMERS -- FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT THEIR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN LISTEN TO BECAUSE THAT THAT'S A TRUST RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN AND I'VE SPENT A YOU KNOW A DAY WALKING WITH THE FOLKS WHO DID HAVE TO REMOVE TREES AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO SEE SOMEONE'S. ORANGE TREE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANTED BY THEIR GRANDFATHER OR SOMETHING HAVE TO BE UPROOTED THE SUCH AT CITRUS INDUSTRY'S BEEN VERY GENEROUS AND TRYING. TO DO REPLACEMENTS WHERE THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT IS. AMAZING HOW C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OPERATIVE THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> CITIZENS HAVE BEEN AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THAT KIND OF COOPERATION THAT'S WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA WORK THAT'S WHEN WE UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER AND SERVE ONE ANOTHER. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS LET'S -- TAKE A SECOND AND GO BACK -- TO ISSUE THIRTEEN MISERY THIS NEEDS TO LIVE AND IF WE CAN GET A MOTION ON THE TABLE LARA. BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA. MULLIN PATTERSON RIGHT YES YES. THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU FOR A A BRING UP THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THE THE TOPIC OF OF HONEY BEES AND COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER AND THE NEO NEXT GOOD. TAUGHT IN THE NEONICOTINOID -- ISSUE THOSE ARE ALL KIND OF PERCOLATING OUT THERE AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- CITRUS TREES CAPTION -- A WITHOUT POLLINATION POLLINATION TYPICALLY IS COMING FROM FROM BEES AND TO SO I I THINK THAT -- WE ALL SHARE AND IT A AND INTEREST IN RESOLVING THE THIS KIND OF ISSUE AND IN A WAY THAT -- TO WORKS FOR EVERYONE YES AND AND THAT THAT'S BEEN THE OUR CONSULTATION PROCESS WITH DPR AS WELL AS E. HA ON PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WE ALSO DO A CONSULTATION WITH FIELD. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S -- AND THE NEO NECKS ARE USED IN ACCORDING WITH THE CRITERIA TO PREVENT IMPACTS TO BEES IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER. CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE BUT I ALSO HAVE TO THINK THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR FOR THE INVESTMENT IS BEING MADE IN OUR BE SAFE PROGRAM. SO THAT WE CAN GET BEE HIVES REGISTERED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT BEING PLACED IN PLACES THAT ARE NOT. NOT A COMPATIBLE WITH THE CROPS THAT MAYBE USING PESTICIDES SO WE'RE MAKING A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT BECAUSE THESE ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR ALMOND BLOOM EACH YEAR IS LITERALLY THE WORLD'S LARGEST. POLLINATION PROJECT WHEN IT OCCURS -- SO BEES MATTER TO CALIFORNIA AND TO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS BEING AN IMPORTANT PART. OF JUST. MAKING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECOSYSTEMS HOLE. ALSO A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW FRAGILE OUR ECOSYSTEMS COMMITTEE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- LA -- I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME COMMENTS ON THIS YES THANK YOU SEAN MARTIN OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST GIVING THIS. THAT THAT RECENT INCREASES IT. AND THE SPREAD OF BOTH ASIAN CITRUS WELLAND ANIMAL LONG ON BEING IN THE GROWING NUMBERS OF TREES INFECTED WITH ONE LINE BANG OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- WE THINK THE REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND RESOURCES FOR THE DEDICATED DIVISION IS REASONABLE -- WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT YOU REQUIRE CDFA TO REPORT ON THEIR CURRENT YEAR EXPENDITURES -- AS PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WE NOTED THAT THEY WEREN'T PLANNING ON SPENDING SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE APPROPRIATED TO THEM IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE IN YOUR AGENDA THAT WE RECOMMEND YOU GAS TO DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE THEY'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED SOME OF THEM. THANK YOU I HATE WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH OUR STAFF RECOMMENDED. THAT -- WE'RE NOT TOO FAR APART HERE BUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN SO WILL -- I WILL DO THAT -- AND WHEN WE ALLOW -- MISTER FUNK TO ADD ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN BECAUSE I THINK HE'S NEEDS TO RUN. ISSUE THIRTEEN CURRENT VOTE FOUR ZERO CHAIR VOTING I FONG. WELCOME LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWELVE AND AND TWELVE ORTEZ FOURTEEN DOES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE A BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE UNIQUE AGENCY IN THAT REGARD -- THIS SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS WHAT WE PRIORITIZE AS CRITICAL STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES. ONE IS IN OUR HAWAIIAN -- FRUIT FLY REARING FACILITY AND THE OTHERS FOR A PLANT. PAST DIAGNOSTIC CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- OUR HAWAIIAN FRUIT FLY REARING FACILITY I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT THE WONDER OF OUR THAT FLIGHT PROGRAM WITH THE RELEASE OF STILL FLIES. THE BREEDING FACILITY IS IN HAWAII -- AND IT IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF IMPROVED CLIMATE CONTROL I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE FOR BEACH RIGHT KEVIN. ON HEATING AND COOLING -- IT'S VERY INTERESTING THIS PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH. AND WITH IMPROVED -- CLIMATE CONTROL IN THIS FACILITY IT WILL ENSURE THAT ONLY THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY BUT HOPEFULLY IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF NUMBERS AS WELL AS QUALITY OF THE FRUIT FLIES. ON BETTER THAN BROUGHT OVER TO OUR FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THEY'RE DEPLOYED SO THAT'S WHAT THAT PARTICULAR ONE IS -- FOR THE SECOND ONE IS FOR A PLANT PASSED DIAGNOSTIC LAB -- I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT AN INVESTMENT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO A STOP ARE LEAKING ROOF FROM LEAKING LAST YEAR. THAT WORK HAS FINALLY BEEN COMPLETED HOWEVER. WE'RE STILL HAVING WATER INTRUSION PROBLEMS MOSTLY AROUND WINDOW SILLS. AND GIVEN THE INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE AND HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED AND SENSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THAT WORK SPACE FOR EMPLOYEES WE WANT TO FINISH THE JOB THAT WAS STARTED BY GETTING THE ROOF DONE AND NOW FINISHING THESE% OTHER AREAS OF WATER INTRUSION. GET THAT FINISH SO THOSE TWO PROJECTS ARE THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TO FOR ME. THAT IS THE WHOLE Y. E.. WHERE LIKE THAT THE WHOLE WIFE REPLY REARING FACILITY IS THAT AND WHY IT IS IN HAWAII SOMETHING THAT THE FIELD TRIP? I WAS TALKING TO SAY I WAS GOING TO OFFER TO FIELD TRIPS FOR YOU ONE WOULD BE TO HAWAII SHOULD YOU HAVE OTHER BUSINESS THERE. AND THE OTHER ONE IT'S JUST IT IS FASCINATING TO GO TO THE FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO VISIT IT'S AT THAT'S ANOTHER IT'S A LOT OF TRAILERS ALL HOOKED UP TOGETHER U. S. T. A. KEEPS PROMISING ELSEWHERE ON THE HIGH PRIORITY LIST. FOR UPDATING THAT FACILITY BUT JUST TO SEE THE DEDICATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DO. TO GROW THESE FRUIT FLIES OUT AND THEN LOAD THEM ONTO THESE PLANES IT'S A PRETTY FASCINATING THAT WILL BE ADDRESSING THAT I I ENJOY A VISIT TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FACILITY AND EXTEND THE INVITATION TO THE REST OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- AND TO FOURTEEN ISSUE FOURTEEN CATS YES. SO -- THE FIRST PART OF THIS AS A TECHNICAL REQUEST THAT WOULD CONVERT SIX BLANCA POSITIONS TO PERMANENT POSITIONS. NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED THIS WE JUST NEED THE AUTHORITY FOR THE CONVERSION OF THOSE. POSITIONS. OUR NEXT ONE DEALS WITH THE FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER AND A QUOTA IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE DAIRY SECTOR VOTED OVER A YEAR AGO -- TO LEAVE AS STATE MILK MARKETING ORDER AND NOT PULLING PROGRAM TO JOIN A FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER. THAT ACTUALLY TOOK A FACT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONCURRENTLY THE INDUSTRY VOTED TO CONTINUE A CALIFORNIA ONLY QUOTA IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM -- WHAT THAT NECESSITATES IS THIS REQUEST FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ACT FUND OF? FORTY A REDUCTION OF THIRTY FOUR POSITIONS AND TWELVE AT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING TO CLOSE THE DERRY MARKETING BRANCH. AND THE MILK POOLING BRANCH DUE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER -- CDFA WOULD RETAIN FIVE POSITIONS FROM THE CLOSING BRANCHES TO ESTABLISH A QUOTA IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM. THE FUNDING WILL ALLOW CDFA TO COMPLY WITH THE REFERENDUM THAT PUT THIS QUOTE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM IN PLACE. I WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING YEAR IT IS VERY HARD TO LOSE PEOPLE WHO DEDICATED LARGE PARTS OF THEIR CAREERS. TO REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE DAIRY SECTOR AND IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM AND DOING IT IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL WAY. AND I HAVE TO COMMEND THEM FOR THE PROFESSIONAL WAY THAT WE HAVE CLOSED DOWN THIS PROGRAM -- IN ORDER TO TRANSITION TO A FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE UP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DAIRY INDUSTRY. THE NEXT WHAT PART OF THIS IS OUR MOUNTAIN PASS BORDER PROTECTION STATION -- AND AN OPERATIONS EXPANSION THIS IS A FAIRLY NEW FACILITY THAT WE BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE OUR FAST GROWING POPULATION. OF THE PROPOSAL REQUEST SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GENERAL FUND AT THE ALREADY. AND EIGHT POSITIONS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ON GOING TO OPERATE THIS NEW BORDER PROTECTION STATION IN MOUNTAIN PASS. WITH THE VEHICLE TRAFFIC EXCEEDING EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION COMING INTO CALIFORNIA ON I. FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ADDITIONAL CDF. A STAFF IS NEEDED TO PERFORM STATE MANDATED INSPECTION. FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MASSIVE TRAFFIC BACKUPS ON I FIVE WHICH THE PRESENTS A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD. AS WELL AS COULD START TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DIVERT AROUND THESE BORDER. INSPECTION STATIONS THE STATIONS ARE PART OF OUR PAST EXCLUSION ACTIVITIES SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY CRITICAL TO OUR WHOLE SYSTEM. SINCE MOUNTAIN PASS STATION OPEN IN AUGUST OVERNIGHT TRAFFIC PATTERNS HAVE NEAR THOSE OF THE OLD YOUR MOST STATION. IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION VEHICLES AND OVER ONE THOUSAND BOATS HAVE TRAVELLED THREE MOUNTAIN PASS. OF THIS TOTAL ELEVEN POINT 3% OR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND HAVE BEEN DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS -- BY -- DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS A SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER THIS YEAR HIGH RISK INSPECTIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED. TO THE ONE IN BASIC PASS BEING INTERCEPTED AND THIRTY SEVEN NOTICES OF REJECTION BEING ISSUED AT THE STATION. FUNDING IN POSITIONS FOR ADDITIONAL LANES TO BE OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS VITAL TO HELP REDUCE THE DANGEROUS TRAFFIC CONGESTION. AND LINES AT THE MOUNTAIN PASS STATION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. AND THEN CONTINUING ON THIS VERY LONG TECHNICAL. SORRY IF IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE TO BE A LITTLE BIT BRIEFER. OKAY WOULD YOU WOULDN'T GET ANY PUSH BACK FROM THE CHAIR OKAY. UP TO MY DEATH. I BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S A LONG LINE OF ADVOCATES WAITING. TO THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES IS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OP FOR IMPLEMENTING SOME MANDATES ACROSS ALL AGENCIES AS NINE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITY AND ONE POSITION AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE POSITION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THIS IS FOR THE OPERATION OF OUR NETWORK AND SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO MY GREAT ARE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENTS TECHNOLOGIES TENET MANAGED SERVICES DATACENTER ENVIRONMENT AS REPLACE CRITICAL EQUIPMENT THAT HAS REACHED THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE -- THE NEXT ITEM IS -- DEVELOPMENT OF PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES -- THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT REQUEST SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AB ACT FUNDED THIRTY AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING FAR OFFICE OF PESTICIDE CONSULTATION AND ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT THE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT. OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL EFFORTS AND THE TESTING OF ALTERNATIVES FOR PESTICIDES. BAD ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR THE REGISTRATION OR ADDITIONAL MEDICATION MEASURES WHERE WE ASSIST IN FINDING ADDITIONAL -- SOFTER USE OF BIOLOGICAL BASED SOLUTIONS TO PESTICIDES I'M HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR -- THE OFFICE RECEIVE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BEGIN THE SUCH SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT FOR PESTICIDES -- AND THIS WOULD EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO MORE PRO ACTIVELY IDENTIFY BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS AND FIND AT LEAST -- THREE TO FOUR I ARE FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS TO FIND ALTERNATIVES FOR SPECIALTY CROPS SECTOR. INDUSTRIAL HEMP PROGRAM IS A REQUEST FOR SIX POSITIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND FORCE MEANT. AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP PROGRAM. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP FARMING ACT IT DOES REQUIRE -- THAT FEES BOB BE COLLECTED AND DEPOSITED IN THE AG FUND AND THAT THEY BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. TO COVER THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS. THIS PROGRAM -- AS A SIDE NOTE OUR REGISTRATION REGULATORY PACKAGES AT THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND WE EXPECT -- TO HAVE FINAL REGULATIONS IN PLACE EARLY SPRING HOPEFULLY BY THE SECOND WEEK OF APRIL FOR THE FULL REGISTRATION PROGRAM TO BEGIN. AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A TECHNICAL -- REQUEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AT THE READY AND ONE POSITION STARTING IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY THROUGH TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TO ADMINISTER CDF FACE FUNCTIONS THAT REQUIRED THAT WERE REQUIRED BY TWENTY EIGHT LEGISLATION -- TO COORDINATE AND CONSULT WITH CAL CAL EPA CAL RECYCLE. ON ORGANIC WASTE TO COMPOST AND I HOPE THAT WAS STARTED. GREAT -- LA -- I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS. MARTIN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WE AGREE WITH THE STAFF ASSESSMENT AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THAT THAT MANY OF THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE NOT TECHNICAL IN NATURE -- WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO REVERT TO THE LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF SUBMITTING STANDALONE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS A SPECIFICALLY FOR PROPOSALS THAT INCLUDE NEW POSITIONS FUNDING FOR NEW ACTIVITIES. AND OR EXTENSIONS OF FUNDING -- THIS WILL BETTER ENABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT FUNCTION BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THESE PROPOSALS A SICKLY WERE RECEIVING ONE PAGE DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE PROPOSALS. INSTEAD OF LARGER DOCUMENTS THAT CONTAIN ADDITIONAL FISCAL INFORMATION -- SO THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ISSUE WE WILL SAY THAT WE REQUESTED THAT INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE DID THEY WERE VERY FORTHCOMING WITH THE INFORMATION. THANK SENT -- WE WILL ADOPT YOUR RECOMMENDATION -- DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATION IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN IT'S EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE IT'S GOOD TO THINK THAT I CAN ACTUALLY CAM DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT STRUCTURALLY YOU KNOW FOR OUR PURPOSES HERE THAT WE AT HERE TO THAT -- TO TO THAT PRACTICE AND ALLIN ALL SERIOUSNESS -- F. BROTHERS NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHEN WE MOVED TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON ALL OF THE CDFA ISSUES -- TEN THROUGH. FOURTEEN GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON I MADE HER GENDER FROM PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR PESTICIDE REFORM. HLB DISEASE IS CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE STATE TO ENFORCE ADDRESS. HOWEVER WHAT CDFA IS DOING IS FOCUSING JUST ON PRESS CONTROL AND THAT IS IMPORTANT IN THE SHORT TERM IT'S A SHORT TERM MEASURE. BUT FOR LONG TERM DISEASE CONTROL YOU NEED TO INCREASED INCREASED PLANTERS ALIENS YOU NEED TO DO DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND THAT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT KIND OF APPROACH ON A DIFFERENT KIND OF STAFFING. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE OPPOSING THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL CHAIN PROPOSAL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED. TO INCLUDE A AN EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS FOR MORE STAFF WHO ARE HAVE SPECIALTY EXPERTISE IN THE KINDS OF FEELS THAT WOULD LEAD TO BETTER PLANTERS ALIENS DISEASE MANAGEMENT ETCETERA -- WHAT WE'VE HARD THAT UC'S ARE DOING THIS RESEARCH BUT THERE NEED TO BE STAFF WITH THIS KIND OF BASS EXPERTISE? IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO CAN ACTUALLY OPERATIONALIZE THAT RESEARCH IT'S ONE THING TO DO THE RESEARCH AND IT'S ANOTHER THING TO IMPLEMENTED AND IF WE DON'T HAVE EXPERT STAFF TO IMPLEMENTED IN THE DEPARTMENT. THAT RESEARCH DOESN'T GO VERY FAR WHICH IS WHY WE SAY THAT ALONG WITH DOING WHATEVER PEST CONTROL YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO PLEASE ADD MONEY FOR INCREASED STAFFING AT CDFA. FOR SPECIAL EXPORTS TO TO INCREASE PLANT RESILIENCE FOR CITRUS AS WELL AS DISEASE MANAGEMENT THANK YOU. HELLO ALISON JOHNSON FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. ON ISSUE ELEVEN WITH RESPECT -- TO CITRUS GREENING I WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK. ON ENERGY SEE SUPPORTS LONG TERM PLANNING TO ADDRESS SUCH A SCREENING -- AND SIMILARLY BELIEVES THAT THE DEPARTMENT ON BUDGET ALLOCATION SHOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO SUPPORT PLANT RESILIENCE AND DISEASE DISEASE MANAGEMENT. INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS ON CONTROLS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ORGANIC AGRICULTURE. ON ISSUE FOURTEEN I'D LIKE TO RAISE A COUPLE OF ISSUES RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATE BILL TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN INTENDED TO FIGHT THE GROWING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE CRISIS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S OVERSIGHT OF THE DEBATES IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AND BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING THE COMMITMENTS THAT. ON THE DEPARTMENT NEED TO THIS COMMITTEE DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS LAST YEAR. HOWEVER THERE ARE -- TWO MEAN ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED IN WE'D APPRECIATE THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S CONTINUED ATTENTION TO THEM -- THOSE ARE ANNUAL REPORTING BY CFA ON ITS COLLECTION OF VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES AND ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PLAN FOR COLLECTING REPRESENTATIVE ANTIBIOTICS SALES USE DATA. ESPECIALLY IF THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES -- TO RELY ON VOLUNTARY SURVEYS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF ANTIBIOTIC USE DATA. ON WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE MONITORING THESE ISSUES AS THEY CONSIDER SEE IF ITS BUDGET -- BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE THANK YOU -- WELCOME BACK WAS A TURN GOOD MORNING AND TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL -- I'LL FEATHER THEM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY -- AND I WILL ALSO BE ALIGNING ON ONE CALIFORNIA WITH THESE COMMENTS -- FIRST WANT TO START BY MY I WILL BE COMMENTING ON ISSUE NUMBER. TEN BY DIVERSE INITIATIVE. FOR SOMEONE TO SURVIVE BUT THINKING SECRETARY ROSS AND HER STAFF FOR MAKING THEMSELVES -- VERY MUCH AVAILABLE TO US TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH C. M. P. S. WITH MIDLAND SOCIETY ABOUT THE SPIDER VERSION INITIATIVE. SOMETHING THAT THAT'S THE NPS HAS BEEN VERY INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH -- FROM THE GROUND FLOOR -- GOING BACK A COUPLE YEARS WORKING WITH THE PRIOR -- ADMINISTRATION WITH GOVERNOR BROWN THEN GOVERNOR BROWN -- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE OVERALL INTENT OF THE B. C. P. -- AND AND THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON ON THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE A CALIFORNIA POINT RESCUE WHICH AS MISS REYES POINTED OUT THERE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH BEING ABLE TO CATALOG AND AND AND SEED SEED BANK -- HALF OF THE REST OF THE RARE PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA -- AS AS A GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY HUTS BUT I THINK IT CAN'T BE. OVERSTATED HOW IMPORTANT THIS THIS THE BANKING PROJECT IS FOR CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY WHEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET US TO ON A PERCENT OF SEEPING KING OF THE RAREST PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'LL TAKE US ABOUT TWO MILLION MORE DOLLARS. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO DO THE ACTUAL COLLECTION AND THE CATALOGUING AND ANOTHER -- HALF A MILLION TO TO UPDATE AND UPGRADE SOME OF THE THE FACILITIES AND AND AND THE THE TOOLS THAT YOU USED TO TO ACTION CONSERVE THEM LONG TERM -- AND WHAT THAT FUNCTIONALLY MEANS IS THAT IF CALIFORNIANS ABLE TO TO GET THAT ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR I'M TO DO THIS WORK -- WE WILL HAVE PREVENTED PLANT EXTINCTION IN CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD -- WHICH I THINK IS IS A VERY -- I MEAN FOR FOR ME PERSONALLY THAT THE THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S -- PRIORITIZATION OF OUR BY DIVERSITY IN OUR NATIVE -- FLORA -- WE'LL WE'LL GET TO THE FINAL LATER ON BUT JUST REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY -- AND SUPPORT LEAVING THE ITEM OPEN TO ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO WORK WITH WITH THE SECRETARY ON RUSS'S STAFF AT CFA -- TO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MOVE FORWARD AND VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE WORKING GROUP COMING TOGETHER AND AND BEGINNING. TO TO TO GET TO WORK ON CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT THEIR THE BY DIVERSITY INITIATIVE -- WHICH WAS INITIATED BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS RELEASED LAST SEPTEMBER THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR AND AND COMMITTEE -- I'M DOUG JOHNSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL -- ALSO COMMENTING ON ITEM NUMBER. TEN WHERE I STATEWIDE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORT. AND PRIVATE LAND MANAGERS WORKING TO PROTECT THE STATE FROM THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENT. AND ECONOMY FROM INVASIVE PLANTS. AND I AM SPEAKING TO THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF THE BIODIVERSITY B. C. P.. THAT WE BELIEVE AS AN EXCELLENT AND CRITICAL INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND THAT IS FOR THE NOXIOUS WEED MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT. THAT PROGRAM -- SUPPORTS COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE AND TAKING LOCAL ACTION TO REALLY -- MAKE SURE WE GET THINGS EARLY WHICH IS CRITICAL TO PROTECT OUR BIODIVERSITY. IT ALSO PROTECTS -- RECREATION AND WILDLIFE FIRE SAFETY WATER RESOURCES AND OF COURSE AGRICULTURE AS WELL SO WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT B. C. B. ITEM. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTEO CROW ON BEHALF THE PENINSULA OPEN SPACE TRUST AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPEN SPACE AUTHORITY -- ALSO SPEAKING TO ISSUE TEN ARM IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS BC PM WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE TOOK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL HERE ON ITEM NUMBER -- ELEVEN BUT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE B. C. P. AND BRINGING DEDICATED STAFF TO SEE A FACE ADDRESS PROGRAM WE ALSO APPRECIATE -- THE COMMITTEE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN AS A SECRETARY ROSS SAID AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DOING. THIS PROGRAM THIS PAST AND THIS DISEASE IS ONLY EXPANDING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOW FOUND OVER TWELVE HUNDRED TREES WITH THE DISEASE. IS SCARY ESPECIALLY TO THE CITRUS INDUSTRY AND PROTECTING THAT INDUSTRY -- FORTUNATELY IS BEEN CONTAINED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT RECENTLY WE JUST FOUND ACP HEARING SACRAMENTO AND WE NOW HAVE A QUARANTINE HERE -- SO THE BUG IS IS ON THE MOVE WHICH MAKES IS CONCERNED THAT THE DISEASE IS ALSO ON THE MOVE -- WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HOW MUCH STAFF IS NEED TO BE DEDICATED THEIR MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE FUTURE AS THE STAFF MAY NEED TO GROW WITH THIS PROGRAM -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT -- TO SEE IF HE'S PROGRAM CDFA HAS A FANTASTIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INDUSTRY AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE PAST PREVENTION PROGRAM IS REALLY FOR FOCUSED ON THOSE URBAN SOUNDS.
