AB TEN FIFTY PROTECTS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REVENUE STREAMS THAT FEDERAL QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS HAVE TO INVEST IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES- AS TRUE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS UNDERTAKING THE MEDICARE ARE EX TRANSITION TO UTILIZE CALIFORNIA'S MASSIVE PURCHASING POWER. TO SECURE BETTER PRICES ON EVER MORE EXPENSIVE PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRANSITION PLAN IS TO DISRUPT THE THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNT DRUG PURCHASING PROGRAM. WHICH ALREADY REQUIRES DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO GIVE DISCOUNTED PRICING TO MEDICAID F. Q. H. SIX. THESE REBATES AND SAVINGS ARE CRITICAL SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR FQHCS WERE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE FUNDS RIGHT BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. WELL I AGREE WITH THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF SECURING BETTER DRUG PRICES USING OUR STATE PURCHASING POWER. WE'VE YET TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS THIS CHANGE WILL HAVE ON THE SECURITIES. I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PREVIOUS DECISION TO DELAY THE TRANSITION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME. HOWEVER THE ONE TIME FUNDING INCLUDING THIS BUDGET LAST YEAR DOES NOT DOES LITTLE TO COMPENSATE FQHCS FOR THIS ONGOING PROBLEM. WHILE THESE IMPACTS MAY BE EASILY DISMISSED AS UNFORTUNATE DETAILS AT THE STATE LEVEL CUTTING THE FUNDING AFTER WHICH IS HAVE TO BENEFIT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. WHERE WE ALREADY SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. RFQ AGE SHE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW GOOD THINGS MY DISTRICT HAS GOING ON FOR IN THE HEALTH CARE AROUND. AND ONE OF THE LAST RESOURCES I WANT TO SEE CUTS AS A BY PRODUCT OF MEDICARE ARE EX. AB TEN FIFTY PROHIBITS DH CS REGARDING CHANGES TO THE THREE FORTY B. WHICH HAS AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THOSE FQHCS. THIS PROHIBITION IS NARROW. IT INTENDED TO ALLOW OTHER MEDIC CAL OUR EXCHANGES WHICH DO NOT IMPACT FQHCS ADVERSELY. WELL THIS BILL- IN PLACE- AFFECTS ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS TO EVACUATE SEES IT WILL REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES WHICH LEGISLATURE MUST CONSENT TO AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING MISTER CHAIRMAN. THAT DIFFERS FROM THE STATUS QUO OVER WE HAS LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE NO DIRECT SAY OVER THE POLICY EXCEPT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT SEAT AT THE TABLE TO ENSURE ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS TO ALMOST MORAL COMMUNITIES ARE IN FACT FULLY MEDICAID. AB TEN FIFTY A SUPPORT BY HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. I HAVE WITH ME MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THE PHONE TODAY- TORY STAR WITH OPEN DOOR COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTER AND ANDREW WHITE WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER ALLIANCE FOR PATIENT ACCESS- TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TESTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GREY WILL HAVE OUR OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOUR LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD END MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STORY STAR I AM THE CEO OF OPEN DOOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OPEN DOORS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF PRIMARY CARE IN THE FAR NORTHWESTERN COMMUNITY AND HUMBOLDT AND DEL NORTE COUNTIES. LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED CARE SERVICE TO MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND PATIENTS ACROSS THE GEOGRPHIC AREA THE SIZE OF THE CONNECTICUT. WE HAVE TWELVE CLINICAL SITE SERVING THE COMPLETE SPECTRUM OF PATIENTS FROM BIRTH TO DEATH WE ARE ALSO THE LARGEST FOR WRITER PREGNANCY SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY DELIVERING ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED BABIES LAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN SERVING THE NORTH COAST FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AND NOW EMPLOYS A STAFF OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. ALL HEALTH CENTERS INCLUDING OPEN DOOR HAVE LEVERAGE THEIR SAVINGS FROM THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM TO EXPAND CARE AND SERVICES TO THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES AND DISPARITIES RELATED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR HEALTH CENTERS ABILITY TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY COST EFFECTIVE CARE. THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM HAS HELPED OUR HEALTH CENTERS OVERCOME MANY OF THESE BARRIERS TO CARE. WE UTILIZE THE SAVINGS TO EXTEND OUR OUTREACH TO ISOLATED IN HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. IMPROVE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF STAFF. FACILITATE OUR WORKFORCE COMPETITIVENESS WITHIN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO TAKE CONTROL OF IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH AND TO INCREASE BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO VITAL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY COMMON IN OUR POPULATION. WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS GRAY FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT MILLIONS OF MEDICAL PATIENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE NOT HARMED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO MOVE THE MEDICAL PHARMACY BENEFIT OUT OF MANAGED CARE. AND INTO FREE FOR SERVICE BENEFITS. WE ALL AGREE WITH THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT AS A MEDIC CAL ARE EX PROGRAM. IN ITS CURRENT FORM HOWEVER THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE HARM TO CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. THE CURRENT SOLUTION PROPOSED BY THE STATE CAN MITIGATE THE KNOWN NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE MEDICAL OUR ACTS. ON THE SAFETY NET IS INADEQUATE. IN EQUITABLE IN TRANSIENT BEING DEPENDENT ON FUNDING PRIORITIES EACH YEAR. IT WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT AND MEASURABLE DECREASE IN THE CARE AND SERVICE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL. HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THE LEGISLATION BY FORWARD BY SOME GRAY IS. AND IT'S UP. THAT NEEDS- THE USER HAS BETTER. TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH CENTERS WITHIN THE SAFETY NET ARE NOT HARMED. AND ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR CARE SERVICES TO THE STATE OF HONORABLE POPULATIONS WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE PASSAGE OF AB TEN FIFTY TO ENSURE THAT THE MEDICAL PHARMACY TRANSITION. DOES NOT CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET INCLUDING OUR OWN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE CONCERNS AND A PATH FORWARD TO MUTUAL SUCCESS.

WITH THE GOAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT BEGAN THE PHARMACY TRANSITION ARE LAUDABLE. CANNOT HAPPEN AT THE EXPENSE OF CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET. MCCARTY NAKED THE THREE FORTY B. DOT COM PROGRAM I COULD NOT EVEN CLEARER AND IT TENDS. TO ENABLE COVERED ENTITIES AND I QUOTE TO STRETCH SCARCE FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS AND PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. WITHOUT ACTION BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WE SEEKTO EXTREMELY GOVERNMENT DETRIMENTAL HARMS THAT WOULD BEFALL OUR SAFETY NET HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. FIRST OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE RIPPED FROM HEALTH CENTERS THE FUND INTENDED BY CONGRESS TO GO TO HELP CENTER DISTRICT RESOURCES AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE ACCESS. WILL NOT BE DIVERTED BY THE STATE INTO THE STATE TREASURY. HAS RIDICULOUSLY CONCERNING GIVING THAT HEALTH CENTERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND ARE NOW BEING RELIED UPON BY THE STATE TO ENSURE VACCINE EQUITY STATEWIDE. FURTHER UNDERCUTTING THE SAFETY NET IN THIS WAY WITH ME CAP HEALTH CENTERS AND RESULT IN PROGRAM CUTS. AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEE LAY OFFS. THE SECOND MOST SIGNIFICANT HARM WOULD BE A MEDICARE RECIPIENTS THEMSELVES. THESE ARE THE LOWEST INCOME AND MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES IN OUR STATE. NOT ONLY WILL THE EXPERIENCE DECREASED ACCESS TO CARE TO THE PROGRAM AND EMPLOYEE CUTS AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. THEY WILL HAVE DECREASED ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE AT THEIR HEALTH CENTER CLINICAL PROVIDERS WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS.

RISK AND PROVIDERS ARE FACED SOMETIMES WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE HASSLE TO ENSURE CONTINUING VISITS AND CARE. THE SYSTEM RESULTS IN DELAYS OR STOPPAGE AND ALL RESEARCH INDICATES POOR OUTCOMES IN HEALTH AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. WHAT A DRESS THIS ISSUE IN THREE WAYS. ONE BY REQUIRING THESE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS BE PROGRAMS USING EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES. NUMBER TWO REQUIRING THAT AN APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN OR LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL HAVE THE OFFENSE TO SAY IN THE TREATMENT. AND NUMBER THREE IT WOULD DISCONTINUE THE REQUIREMENT FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN HEALTH SERVICES. FOR THE FIRST TWELVE VISITS AND THAT I SHOULD KNOW IT IS LIMITED TO CHIROPRACTIC CARE PHYSICAL THERAPY SPEECH AND AUDIO PATHOLOGY.

THIS BILL ALSO ALLOWS CARE TO BE DELIVERED WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY. AND PUBLISH THAT IS THE NATIONAL SELF OF MEDICINE SHOW THAT COSTS CAN BE AS MUCH AS 75% HIGHER. WHEN ACCESS TO PHYSICAL THERAPY GIVE DELAY. IT AND APOSS ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO INCREASE THE USE OF OPIOIDS. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND SURGERIES. AND RECENT CAP WILL ALLOW OF ONE OF FOR LITTLE NATIONAL PRO FOR PHYSICAL PAYER IN. RESULT IN FIFTH ONE. TO DEPARTMENT MANAGE HEALTHCARE BEFORE THE SHARE HAD A PULL BACK VEHICLES. OF THE PROGRAM. THIS OCCURRED WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS THEN DESPITE THAT THE PAIR HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO RE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AGAIN THIS YEAR. THE PROGRAM IS FRAUGHT WITH ISSUES IN OTHER STATES. EPA HAD. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT EXIST WITH PLANNED USING COMPUTER REVIEWS. BUT THEY'RE BUILT WITH THESE RESOLVE THESE ISSUES ARE LIMITED BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. THIS BILL BOLSTERS THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO OVERSEE HEALTH PLAN. GETS RID OF THE LAID BACK THE SEMESTER CARE AND DOES NOT ADD COST TO THE SYSTEM. I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT IN THE PACKAGE ARE CUTTING AFTER. BRINGING THE SUPPORT BILL FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED IN OPPOSITION- PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GET HAMPTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WE'RE GOING TO BE WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE SPONSORS TO DATE. A PRIMARY ALL RIGHT TO BE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A LOT OF PLAN USERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE SPECIFIC SERVICES. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY MEDICALLY NECESSARY BUT CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL CARE GUIDELINES. WE BELIEVE EIGHTY FORTY SIXTY EIGHT WHAT UNDERMINE THE PROCESS BY ALLOWING PROVIDERS CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES PHYSICAL THERAPY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY. M. F. THEN ON A TRIP OF GREATER TO PROVIDE THEIR PATIENTS. WITH THE TWELVE DIGIT IN EACH DISCIPLINE WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY OVERSIGHT REVIEW BY THE PATIENT PLAN A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. IN ATHENS IF A PATIENT WHERE YOU LIVE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CERTAIN EACH THAT THE PLAN. UNDER THE BILL- THIS POLICY CHANGE GRANTED PATIENT UP TO SEVENTY TWO VISIT FORTY SERVICE YOU FOR THE HEALTH PLAN COULD ENSURE THE MEDICAL THAT THE. O THE CARRIBEAN PROVIDED. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THIS- UP THE FOR THE FOR WASTE ABUSE NOT HELPED DELIVERY. AND MAY RESULT IN RECEIVING ANOTHER. IN ORDER A CARE. REGRETTABLY EIGHTY FORTY FIFTY EIGHT WILL LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS IN HEALTHCARE IT DELIVERY SYSTEM AT TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE- WE BELIEVE THIS BILL ONE FORTUNATELY A CREEPY MINISTRY TO COP. YOU CREEK AFFORDABILITY AND AGAIN ACTUALLY LEAD TO UNNECESSARY CARE DELIVERY. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT.

MISTER CHAIR NUMBER THIRTY WALKING BY BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS WITH RESPECT EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND JUST A TIME I'D LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THE BILL. FIRST I'D LIKE TO REITERATE THAT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SERVES AN IMPORTANT ROLE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IS NOT INTENDED IN ANY LEVEL TO BE PUNITIVE IN NATURE BUT INSTEAD ALLOWS HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE SPECIFIC SERVICES. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY MEDICALLY NECESSARY BUT CONSISTENT WITH APPROPRIATE CLINICAL GUIDELINE. THAT BEING SAID WE ARE CONCERNED THAT EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL NOT GOING TO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR THE THIRD ENUMERATED AND THE THOUGHT OF. THE COULD INADVERTENTLY DELAY THE PROPER THING A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST AS IT APPEARS. AT THAT PLACE THE SECOND LAYER REVIEW FOR THOSE PLANS INSURANCE UTILIZED IN AUTOMATED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM. SHOULD BE NOTED THAT CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REVIEW PROCESS ONLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EITHER MIGHT POSITION OR LIKE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. THE COMPETENCY EVALUATE THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN HEALTHCARE SERVICE REQUESTED BY THE PROVIDER. UNDERSTANDING THAT UNCLEAR WHAT SECTION KATIENA IN THE BILL AND KEPT A COMPLEX OTHER THAN CREATING A SECONDARY REVIEW PROCESS ALL PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS THAT HAVE EITHER BEEN DENIED OR MODIFIED. BURKE BRADLEY ADMITS KIND OF ADDITIONAL LAYER OF COMPLEXITY THE CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD BE NOTHING I NECESSARILY DELAYED THE CURRENT PROCESS AND FURTHER EXACERBATE THE ISSUE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO RAISE WITH RESPECT TO CARE BEING DELAYED.

SEE ANOTHER BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION HAS A MOTION BY MISTER MASON I BELIEVE THE SECOND MY WAS WAS BY MISS WALDRON- THE- MOTION. TO PASS AS AMENDED APPROPRIATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH YOUR CUNNINGHAM YEAH I THINK IT JUST BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES RAISED BY OPPOSITION. I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH OPPOSITION TO THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL WHICH SIMPLY ALIGNS THE ALGORITHMS WITH EVIDENCE BASED CARE AND I THINK THAT'S- FAIRLY SELF EVIDENT AND PROBABLY LEAD TO COST SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN- AS TO THE TWELVE VISITS. I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA. SORT OF GO SEE SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE PROVIDERS TWELVE TIMES EACH IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RED HERRING RESPECTFULLY. I MEAN THIS IS LIMITED TO CHIROPACTIC SERVICES PHYSICAL THERAPY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SPEECH. SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASIAN MEDICINE AN AUDITORY THERAPIES. SO IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH YOUR HEARING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY UNLIKELY TO GO TO A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. THEY PROBABLY GOT A PHYSICAL THERAPIST IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH YOUR NEAR YOUR BACK OR SO FOR SO I DON'T THINK THESE- THAT THAT RISK I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT. OVERBLOWN AND AGAIN. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE CONTENT OF THIS IS TO PUT. EVIDENCE IN CHARGE AND PUT THE- PRACTITIONERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE CARE IN CHARGE OF. OF THE TREATMENT. AND MOVE MOVE AWAY FROM ALGORITHMS THAT MAY LEAD TO. SORT OF ARBITRARY DECISIONS AND CARE- THE TWELVE VISITS BY THE WAY IS SOMETHING THAT IS ADOPTED. I DON'T HAVE A LIST OF STATES TODAY BUT A LOT OF OTHER STATES HAVE THAT TWELVE IS THE THING. THAT'S THREE YOU KNOW THAT'S WEEKLY VISITS FOR THREE MONTHS BASICALLY- AT THAT POINT THEY NEED. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION FROM THAT POINT ON SO THANK YOU WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AYE BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CUNNINGHAM- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT IS A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ENTERING HOSPICE CARE NOT SUBJECT TO ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT SCHEMES THAT THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION AND LANGUAGE AND MATTER THE PATIENT OR CAREGIVER UNDERSTANDS AND SPECIFIES THAT ONLY AN RN LPN. MEDICAL SOCIAL WORKER CHAPLAIN OR COUNSELORS BOARD BY THE HOSPITAL CAN ENROLL PATIENTS IN HOSPICE PROGRAMS HOSPICE CARE IS INTENDED TO MAKE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS AS PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE HOSPICE HAS BEEN A GUARANTEED MEDICARE BENEFITS AND IS ALSO INCLUDED IN MANY PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS HOSPICE CARE UNDER THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT REQUIRES DOCUMENTATION FROM TWO PHYSICIANS ESTIMATING THAT A PERSON HAS LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. IF THE DISEASE FOLLOWS ITS USUAL COURSE ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN THE NUMBER OF POORLY PERFORMING HOSPICES INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY AS ACCESS AND- ACCESS ASSESS INCOMING HOSPICE PATIENTS THE O. I. G. REPORT FOUND THAT HOT- CALIFORNIA HOSPICES LEAD THE NATION FOR ENROLLING PATIENTS WERE NOT TERMINALLY ILL. AND CLAIMING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE PATIENTS PREDATORY RECRUITING WHEN HOSPICE PROVIDERS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TARGET AND ENROLL PATIENTS BY USING DECEITFUL AND AGGRESSIVE TACTICS SUCH AS OFFERING CASH GIFT CARDS OR OTHER ITEMS OF VALUE IS A ROWING PROBLEM. MEDICARE AND THE- I. O. I. G. REPORTS THAT PATIENTS SOMETIMES DO NOT RECEIVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE AND ROLLING AND WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AND WHAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT TO RECEIVE UNDER THE HOSPICE MEDICARE BENEFITS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TAKES IMPORTANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ENROLLING IN HOSPICE CARE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ILLEGAL INDUCEMENTS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HOSPICE CARE IS AND THAT THEIR ALEXION OF THE HOSPICE INFORMED CONSENT AND COUNSELING ON THE ELECTION. OF HOSPICE IS COMPLETED BY THE APPROACH. PROFESSIONAL AB TWELVE EIGHTY REQUIRES THE WRITTEN AND VERBAL NOTICE OF THE PATIENT'S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN A LANGUAGE AND MANNER THAT THE PATIENT UNDERSTANDS. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AT THE END OF LIFE RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE CARE THAT ADDRESSES. THE PATIENT'S AND THE FAMILY'S NEEDS AB TWELVE EIGHTY WILL REDUCE NEGLIGENCE AND FRAUD THAT TARGET THE TERMINALLY ILL AND THEIR FAMILIES.

WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- PLEASE GOING WE YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CHRISTY WEEKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL PLANS IN OPPOSITION. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THE WORK IS DONE ON THE BILL INCLUDING THE VERY TOP AND OF THE MARKET AMENDMENTS. WE DO THAT THESE AMENDMENTS IMPROVE AT ALL IN ORDER. RESPONSE TO THE- FOR. AND DETRIMENTAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE IN BILL AS A- DENTAL IMPLANTS ARE VERY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE DENTIST THEY CONTRACT WITH. WHICH IS WHY. OUR PLANS PROACTIVE. PROVIDE NEARLY THIRTY SIXTEEN DOLLARS SUPPORT. TO DENTISTS INTO TWENTY AFTER THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS WERE ENACTED. WE HAVE SEEN FAN THAT. THE CONSUMER HAVE RETURN. TO THE DONE. I THEY'RE USING THEIR BETTER AND THEY ARE RISKY SERVICES AND CAN TALK HAVE BURKE. WELL WE APPRECIATE HIM WE BELIEVE THAT THE- OF THE BILL. REMAINS AB FOUR FIVE WERE WOULD PLACE THE PLAN IN THE POSITION OF INCH. A DENT PRACTICE. WHICH IS PRIVATE. AND DOES NOT REFLECT PLAN TO DO ALL. TO USE THE CREAM ALL THAT ARE PAID THEM BY EMPLOYER. TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO CONTINUE. THE BILL EVEN AS AMENDED WOULD FOR DENTAL PLANS TO EMPLOY PREMIUMS ON. TO SUBSIDIZE PARK. AND WOULD NOT IN BECAUSE ACCESS TO FOR. WHILE WE VERY MUCH OF THE A MAN FOR THE INJURY D. D. P. OR IN OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH- NECK WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. NICOLINO ON BEHALF TO OUR ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS- AND WE ARE OPPOSE TO THE BILL. WE KNOW THAT WE MEMBER RODRIGUEZ- GOOD HERE BUT REGRETTED EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY FOUR IS WRONG. BE PROMOTED AT THE WRONG TIME. AB FIFTY FOURTH ST. FOR A UNIQUELY COVER FUND PROVIDING FINANCE RELIEF- ENTER FOR ITS THE TRANSFERS FROM ONE SECTOR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER SET OF THE U. AND WE BELIEVE THIS IN A PRO. AND BASED ON A PRECARIOUS LEGAL FOUNDATION I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THAT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME LAST YEAR PATIENT VOLUME WAS DOWN DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDATION TO AVOID ELECTED HERE. THAT IS WHY IT REALLY IN THE PANDEMIC TO HELP PLAN STEPPED UP TO ASSIST OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS IN A MYRIAD OF WAYS ON INCLUDING RENEGOTIATING CONTRACTS EXPEDITING CLAIMS PROCESSING PAYMENTS PROVIDING GRANTS OR LOANS TO PROVIDERS ON INTO EATING CANDY OR FUNDING PROVIDERS. FOR PP PURCHASE. FOR THE BILL DOLLAR IN FOR AND STATE ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE TO SEE THEM THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. WE PUT OF THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T REDUCE PROPOSED- IS. AT FEELS RECOGNIZE HIS SUPPORT PROGRAM IN INCREASE CLAIMS FOR ELECT AND NON PRESS. DO TO THE PENN UP DEMAND- OR RELIGION AND NOW. BY HARVARD. FRIENDS DOWN THAT CARE IS RETURNING ANY A CLEANING PREPAY WILL. INFORMATION THAT WE'VE ABLE TO GET FROM A MEMBER HEALTH PLAN. BACK UP OF MIND- ADDITIONALLY CAL PER OR RECEIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER MONTH FROM PLANS. OF PATIENT. BUSINESS BECAUSE MANY TO ARE ON A CAP BASIS WHICH ARE VOLUNTARY CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH PLAN TO MAKE PERIODIC PAYMENTS TYPICALLY MONTHLY ON A PER MEMBER PER MONTH BASIS TO PROVIDERS THAT INCLUDE THE COST OF PROVIDING MEDICAL SERVICES. AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. IT OR NOT RIGHT TO PAY VOLUME SO THE CONTINUE TO FLOW FOR HEALTH PLAN TO PROVIDE. HE DURING THAT. ALL AND THERE WERE ABOUT TWO FOUR FIFTY FIVE BILLION. PER YEAR- IN OTHER POINT THREES QUICKLY HELLO HISTORY EXPANDED A LITTLE YEAR PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO HAVE PARITY WITHIN PERSON SERVICES. SO YOU KNOW SPEAKING TO COURSE OF THE BILL RELATED A COMPANION ADMIN OF THE OVERHEAD COSTS OF PROVIDERS IN SOME CASES SHOULD HAVE DECLINED IN THAT IS NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HERE AS WELL. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- MISTER MEMBERS A CONSUMER HARM HERE'S AT THE BILL FORCES- PLANS TO DIVERT CRITICAL PREMIUM DOLLARS PAID BY CONSUMERS. AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE TO PROVIDERS FOR NON MEDICAL SERVICES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT ANY RESPONSIBLE- PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME WE DO RECOGNIZE THE AMENDMENT AS YOU KNOW AS AS THE PREVIOUS- WITNESS STATED. THAT WERE ANALYZING THOSE WE THINK THEY COME FROM A GOOD PLACE BUT THEY DON'T RESOLVE THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS. IN THIS BILL- WE DO REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS TO DRESS STABILITY ISSUES BUT THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. TO THIS PROBLEM SO WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. ON. EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE MOVE TO THE FOR LINES FOR. OTHER SINCE. OR ON. JUST YOUR NAME- ORGANISER IF YOU REPRESENT ONE IN POSITION ON THE BILL.

IF THEY WOULD LIKE. AND MANY OF THE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES HAVE A VIRUS EXEMPTION SO MOST BUSINESSES WERE NOT ABLE TO USE THOSE TO ADDRESS- THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE PUBLIC CRISIS. WE DID INCLUDE AMENDMENTS SPUR FOR COMMITTEE THAT LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID OKAY- THE ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU ARE GIVEN TO A PROVIDER. WOULD NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY STATE OR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE OR INSURANCE THAT WAS AVAILABLE. WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE PROVIDERS DOUBLE DIP WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT CALL WAS GOING TO BE I DON'T THAT PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT PROVIDING THE REGULATORS AND ONE MORE TOOL IN THE TOOL BELT- AND WE DON'T MEAN FOR THAT TO START OVERLAP WITH ANY ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR- BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN WHATEVER THE NEXT COVERT SITUATION IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO MY QUESTION IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE GONNA TAKE THE PATIENTS POLICY AND THAT WILL GO. THAT POLICY THAT THE PATIENTS OR THE EMPLOYER PAYS. WILL THEN TURN INTO AND INSURANCE THAT'S ALREADY IN EXISTENCE ESSENTIALLY THAT ONLY JUST NEED THE CAVIAR THAT SAID THAT WE ALSO INCLUDE. ANY SORT OF COVERT PANDEMIC I'M. JUST NOT SURE WHY IT PATIENTS. PREMIUM WOULD GO TO THE BUSINESS AND THAT WAY INSTEAD OF AN INSURANCE BUT LIKE A TRADITIONAL INSURANCE POLICY THAT. ALREADY BASICALLY STRUCTURED TO PROVIDE HELP OF BUSINESS DURING SOME SORT OF. CRISIS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR WHY NOT JUST ADD THE EXEMPTION LIKE BUT LIKE SEE LIKE PRIYANKA SAID. WHY NOT ADD THE EXEMPTION OF KOBE TO THOSE POLICIES INSTEAD OF CREATING THIS WHOLE NEW MECHANISM. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER I'M SURE SHE CAN ANSWER. THE MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN A QUESTION. A QUESTION A QUESTION I ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY ADJUST THE PREMIUM WHY CHANGE THE FLOW OF THE PREMIUMS WHY NOT JUST REQUEST THAT BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE. COVER PANDEMICS. SINCE THE BUSINESS ALREADY PROBABLY PAYS FOR THAT. COMMENT FROM THE QUESTION THE ANSWER TO QUESTION- I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE TO COVER PANDEMICS I THINK- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE ISSUES IS THAT GENERALLY IT'S SO CATASTROPHIC THAT IT IS IT'S THEYHAVE TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF WAIVERS IN THERE BECAUSE THE- THE INSURANCE CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO COVER THAT- AS FAR AS WHY WE DID IT THIS WAY. THE PLANS DO HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO HELP MAINTAIN NETWORK ADEQUACY AND SIMILAR TO THE STORY THAT THE REGULATORS HAVE CURRENTLY THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO END IT WHEN THEY'RE STATE OF EMERGENCY I THINK IT WAS PASSED IN RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE FIRES TO STEP IN AND ENSURE THAT THE PLANS ARE PROVIDING AND MAKING ACCESSIBLE MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. WE SAW THIS AS ONE ADDITIONAL TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX OF SHORE UP THE PROVIDER NETWORKS IN THE INSTANCE OF A CATASTROPHIC SITUATION A PANDEMIC LIKE KOBE NINETEEN HONESTLY WE HOPE THIS WILL NOT EVER BE USED- BUT SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN IT'S JUST ONE EXTRA LITTLE AUTHORITY. WHEN WE WENT TO THE REGULATORS LAST YEAR AS WE WERE IN THE THICK OF COVED AND SAID HEY IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE PLANS IS NOT REALLY SUFFICIENT FIRMS TO HELP OUR PROVIDERS I KNOW THAT- THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT ON THE SOME OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT WAS PROVIDED. WHEN WE TALK TO THE REGULATORS THEY BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY AUTHORITY SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST PROVIDE THEM ONE ACTUAL LITTLE BIT OF A STORY WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND AGAIN HOPE THAT IT WOULDN'T BE NEEDED. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. FOR I APPRECIATE THAT THANK AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR COVERAGE I JUST. I THINK IT'S- AN OF I THINK IT'S BETTER PLACED IN AN INCH. TRADITIONAL INSURANCE POLICY BUT THANK YOU THINK. THANK YOU MISS BURKE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN THAT- THE BILL DOES DO YOU HAVE A DOPASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS- IT HAS A MOTION I'M SORRY. OH I'M SORRY.

THIS AND SIMILAR AREAS- BUT I AM STILL A LITTLE. UNCLEAR AS TO THIS BEAN- SORT OF THE MOST EFFICIENT VEHICLE TO BRING THIS SORT OF INSURANCE OR THIS SORT OF REMEDY FOR ITSELF- I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT IS THIS MOVES ON- I THINK THAT IF IT DOES MOVE ON- AND I WON'T BE.

GET A BTTER PLACE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE WITH THE PANDEMIC IN THE BARS WOULD HAVE DONE TO NOT ONLY THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES BUT BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS SOMETHING NEW FOR ALL OF US SO. HOPEFULLY THIS LIKE THAT THE SPONSOR WILL NEVER HAVE TO REVISIT THIS TYPE OF ISSUE BUT IF THERE IS WE HAVE SOME RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR STRUGGLING BUSINESSES IN THIS CASE WITH THE DENTAL DENTAL.

TO THEIR HEALTHCARE PLAN. AND THIS IS A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE BY ALLOWING ADULT CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS A HEALTHCARE PLAN WILL HELP SAVE FAMILIES MONEY BY ALLOWING THEM TO COMBINE.

FOR ALL AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EQUALITY AND EQUAL ACTION- WE STILL TO THE AND TEAR TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE CONTINUE TO GET MORE CALLS- INSURED ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES- ACTION COMMISSIONER AND FROM MY TIME THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO INCREASING HEALTH DOCTORS HOWEVER IF YOU TREATING COSTS OF HEALTHCARE WHICH ARE HURTING FAMILIES ACTUALLY DURING THAT ACADEMIC WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IT'S EVEN MORE CRUCIAL. SB FIVE SEVENTY IS NEEDED HERE AND- NOW TO ALLOW ADULT CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR DEPENDENT PARENTS TO THEIR HOUSE INSURANCE POLICIES AND REALLY HOW ARE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY FOR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT STILL LACK MEANINGFUL COVERAGE. THE MEASURE PROVIDES FAMILIES WITH ANOTHER OPTION FOR HEALTH COVERAGE ONE THAT WILL BE INDIVIDUALIZED PERSONAL DECISION WE'LL GET INDIVIDUALIZED PERSONAL INDEPENDENT FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILY CONSIDERS THE HELP OPTION THAT IS BEST SUITED. AND CONVENIENT FOR THEM IN ADDITION EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY OPENS UP ON THE PATHWAY TO COVERAGE FOR FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT PARENTS WERE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AN INDIVIDUAL POLICY TO COVER CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE ESPECIALLY UNDOCUMENTED DEPEND OF PARENTS WHO COULD NOT PURCHASE COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA.

JUST MAKING SURE YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY THE NEW A DEPRESSING YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF AB FIVE SEVENTY WHAT THE BILL CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED IT CARRIES CONCERNING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES PRIMARILY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING TO RECOVER FROM A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT YEAR THE OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT WE HAVE AB FIVE SEVENTY IS THE HUGE HEALTHCARE COSTS INCREASE THE STRUGGLING AND RECOVERING EMPLOYERS WILL EXPERIENCE AND THE BILL. JEFFERSON OUT THE TWO DIFFERENT COSTS IN AREAS CONTAIN WITH THAT AT FIRST IN A LOW ENROLLMENT SCENARIO UNDER EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTEEN EMPLOYER PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN A HI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ROMAN&lt;/c&gt; SCENARIO UNDER AB FIVE SEVENTY PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AS YOU WELL KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES THAT STRUGGLE TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HUGE COMPONENT OF THAT STRUGGLE HAS BEEN PAYING FOR HEALTHCARE SO MUCH SO THE FEDERAL PPP LANDS IN STATE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS FOR EXTENDED TO EMPLOYERS TO HELP PAY THOSE COSTS. IN TO PUT THESE COSTS INTO PERSPECTIVE THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY INDICATED THAT HER JOB BASED COVERAGE OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE ROSE 4% TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO DOLLARS EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY WILL EXACERBATE THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE IN SPRING STRUGGLING SMALL EMPLOYERS BUT AT THE TIME OF THE FINALLY BEGINNING TO RECOVER. ADDITIONALLY SMALL CLERK WILL BE FORCED TO REASSESS HOW MUCH THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO EMPLOYEES AND THE PREMIUMS AND THE SORT OF PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT WILL BE DISCOURAGED IN THE BILL HOWEVER IN THANKFULLY OF COURSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OFTEN DO THIS BY AND LARGE FOR MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY IS FOCUSED. ON COVERING- THEY CAN OBTAIN COVER INVEST. CASE UNDER MET. THANK YOU UNDER BUT- AND IN SOME STATES. THAT ARE COVERED. ADDITIONALLY THIS POINT EIGHTY FOUR IF HAPPEN TO LAW WOULD ALSO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS. TO TAKE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDI CAL REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COVERAGE OPTIONS REGARDLESS OF AB FIVE SEVEN. DON'T CLOSING EIGHTY FIVE SEVEN IS WELL INTENTIONED OF COURSE I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. THIS WILL BE A FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR STRUGGLING SMALL EMPLOYERS THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING TO RECOVER NOW WILL KEEP THE SCOPE OF THE PORTABLE CARE ACT IN THE LARGELY UNNECESSARY. COVER COPIES ALREADY BEST. TO PLEASE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. EIGHTY FIVE SEVEN EIGHT AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES FOR.

HEALTH COVERAGE FOR ALL- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET. PEOPLE EVERYONE COVERED I THINK THE SYSTEM IS HEALTHIER FOR ALL IF WE DO THAT- THIS COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE COVERAGE BY 200-008-0000 PEOPLE WERE NOT REALLY COMPLETELY SURE- BUT- I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS WHICH COULD BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND ALMOST NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT SCENARIOS SO- I AM A LITTLE TORN. THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I THINK THE BILL IS LIKELY TO INCREASE HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND MAY OFFER. AFFORDABLE COVERAGE OPTIONS. BUT I'M I'M I FEEL LIKE THERE MAY BE SOME MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST INCREASE MEAN TO EMPLOYERS. AND ULTIMATELY EMPLOYEES IN TERMS OF PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS SO- LIKE I SAID THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION- MR SANTIAGO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU MISTER FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND- GUIDED POINTED OUT.

TO HELP FACILITATE OUTDOOR DINING AS WELL AS MORE ROBUST TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY OPTIONS.

COUNTY WAS SHUT DOWN FOR ALMOST NINE MONTHS. EVEN TODAY THEY CONTINUE TO BE RESTRICTED IN ALL COUNTIES TO UNSUSTAINABLE INDOOR CAPACITY LIMIT ACCESS THAT IS 50% OF THE INDOOR CAPACITY AND WITH THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE FOR CABLE PLACEMENT FOR ME AND SMALL RESTAURANTS LIKE MINE. REALLY ONLY ALLOWS CONTINUATION OF THE STATE. THIS IS WHY OUT DINING HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR US TO SHARE OUR GUESTS. COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE EMPLOYERS TO EMPLOY OUR AMAZING TEAM MEMBERS. I KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE FOR SO MANY SMALL RESTAURANTS WERE OWNED BY MINORITIES AND WOMEN. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN FACT OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE ARE RESILIENT AND WE ARE DETERMINED AND OUTDOOR.

THERE'S NO RESIDENTS HAVE CERTAINLY SUFFERED IN THE LAST YEAR AND WE OWE IT TO THEM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF NURSING HOME CARE. OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING STANDARDS ARE PRETTY GOOD THEY HAVE BEEN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT WHICH WAS ABYSMAL PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL CURTAIL DURING THE PANDEMIC. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE WILL ENHANCE DETERRENCE OF BAD CARE AND NURSING HOME. SUCH DETERRENCE HAS NEVER BEEN NEEDED MORE. THE BILL PROVIDES CLARITY TO THE CRITERIA FOR DOUBLY CITATIONS SO THAT WE BETTER DETER THE CONDUCT THAT CAUSES THE DEATH OF RESIDENTS. AND THE BILL GIVES A LONG OVERDUE INFLATIONARY BUMP THE PENALTY AMOUNT TO ENSURE THAT DETERRENCE IS NOT ERODED BY DEPRECIATING DOLLARS. R. CITATION CITATION SYSTEM IS VERY FLAWED. COMPLAINT AGAINST NURSING HOMES CONTINUE TO RISE EVERY YEAR AND ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE COMPLAINTS REMAINED PRETTY FLAT AND LETHARGIC. DALY I SPEAK TO RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE BEYOND FRUSTRATED BY THE STATE INCONSISTENCY IN MEANINGFULLY ENFORCING THE RULES MEANT TO PROTECT THEM. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE WILL UPDATE THE LAW AND BRING A LITTLE MORE CONSISTENCY IN A LITTLE MORE JUSTICE TO ENFORCEMENT.

MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU HAVE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING. THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY DEMANDS CLARIFIED THAT PHYSICIAN APPROVAL IS NEEDED BEFORE AN OVERRIDE CAN OCCUR AND THAT IS BILL DOES NOT LIMIT MEDICAL STAFF'S ABILITY TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE. THESE AMENDMENTS ARE PRODUCT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT WELL ALLOW HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE TO OVERRIDE A HOSPITAL OUT OF THE RIVER. WITH PHYSICIAN APPROVAL WHEN THIS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND ULTIMATELY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS CAN BE CONSULTED WHEN WITH WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE INTRODUCED INTO A HEALTH FACILITY TO ENSURE A SMOOTH IMPLEMENTATION. WHILE THE RHYTHMS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL USED TO HELP DECIDE TE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS OF PATIENTS A YEAR. ARRHYTHMIC BIAS AND SPECIFICALLY RACIAL BIAS AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. AT TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY FOUND I WIDELY USE HOSPITAL ALGORITHM REFERRED BLACK PATIENTS TO PESTER CARE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER TIMES. THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. WHEN IN NEW ARE RE IS IT REPEATEDLY SHOW US. THE WIDESPREAD IMPACT OF IMPLICIT BIASES WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. MAJOR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ALREADY RECOGNIZED THIS NEED AS WELL. AND CONCURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THE SAME WORKER PROTECTIONS TO THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TECHNOLOGISTS CERTAINLY A HELPFUL TOOL THAT COMPLEMENTS THE SKILLS OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. BUT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT. FOR REAL LIFE X. EXPERIENCE ULTIMATELY WILL BE PROVIDE AS MANY CHECKS AS POSSIBLE TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIASES IN ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE WE WILL SAVE LIVES. AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT PROMOTES PATIENT WELL BEING BY CREATING NECESSARY PROTECTIONS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO DO THEIR JOBS WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION BECAUSE THE QUESTION AT ALL RETURN. AS THEIR PATIENTS ADVOCATE WITH ME TODAY DERIDE TESTIMONY. OVER THE PHONE THIS TAYLOR JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION.

EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT SIMPLY ENSURE THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CAN DISAGREE WITH THE CLINICAL ALGORITHM TO MAKE THE BEST TREATMENT DECISION FOR THEIR UNIQUE PATIENT WHEN IT IS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE WHICH NOW INCLUDES THE APPROVAL OF THE PATIENT'S POSITION WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT. FROM THEIR EMPLOYER SOLELY FOR THE DECISION. THEY'RE BOUND BY THEIR LICENSE CURRENTLY AND THEY'RE TRYING COMMITMENT TO THEIR- TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND- THAT CARE AND TREATMENT. HOWEVER WE A CLEAR OUTWEIGH RECALLING FOR IN THE CODE. WE'RE DOING JUST THAT THERE'S BEEN HEALTHCARE WILL. TO BE PUT IN POSITION. WHERE THE BACK HERE THERE FOR THE PATIENTS.

HEALTHCARE TREATMENT IS NEVER A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FORMULA AND THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WILL MEAN THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS PRIORITY AND REMAIN THEIR PATIENTS. FOR THAT REASON THE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. THE YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITH SINCE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WOULDN'T- JENNIFER BAILEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WHERE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. OCTOBER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS PRESENTING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES IN TERMS OF INFECTION RATE HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY MANY BELIEVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS A SOLUTION TO GUIDE CLINICAL DECISION MAKING FOR THE PROBABLY FEES RESULTING IN THE RAPID DISSEMINATION OF UNDERDEVELOPED AND POTENTIALLY BY MODEL. WHICH MAY EXACERBATE. THE DISPARITIES GAP. THERE'S HOPE THAT AI HELP TREATMENT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES WITHIN THE CRISIS. HOWEVER IT SHOULD NOT LIMIT INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL JUDGMENT. OR A HEALTH CARE WORKERS ABILITY TO ACT AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE. ALGORITHM SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE CARE NEEDED BY PATIENTS. GIVEN THE PERVASIVENESS OF FIVE HE'S A FAILURE TO PROACTIVELY DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC RISKS EXACERBATING EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HINDERING THE ADOPTION OF A AYE TOOL CAPABLE OF IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOME.

PERFECT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR OUT OF WORK. THANK YOU ALEX AUTHORITY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THE BILL AND- SEVERAL OF THE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN TODAY. BUT SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES DO REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED. FIRST THE BILL UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATE EXISTING CLINICAL IMPERFECTIONS WALL INTO THE LABOR CODE. THIS EXPOSES HOSPITALS TO A BROAD ARRAY OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. SMALL VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW INCLUDING VIOLATIONS WERE NO HARM OCCURRED. CAN'T FIGURE EXPENSIVE LAWSUITS FROM PLAYERS GENERATING LARGE FEES FOR ATTORNEYS BUT SMALL WORDS FOR WORKERS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY AUTHORED BY THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT DAS RELATIONS. AND FORMER CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH THE AVERAGE AWARD TRUMP FULLY IN THESE TYPES OF LAWSUITS WAS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHEREAS THE AVERAGE ATTORNEY FEE WAS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SECOND LIKE ALL EMPLOYERS AND PARTICULARLY IN HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE LIVES ARE AT STAKE EMPLOYERS MUST HAVE MANAGEMENT RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN A CHAIN OF COMMAND. BY PLACING AN INDIVIDUAL PRACTICING PRACTITIONERS JUDGMENT OUTSIDE OF EXISTING PROCESSES EVIDENCE IN TECHNOLOGY THE BILL EXPOSES PATIENTS TO UNNECESSARY RISK OF WELL INTENTIONED BUT- ULTIMATELY UNSAFE MEDICAL TREATMENT. FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN WHO'S IN OUR- VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS EMILY HUGHES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WE APPRECIATE THE TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND HE AND HIS STAFF HAVE PUT IT UNDERSTANDING OUR CONCERNS. OUR INITIAL DISTRESS WAS IN REGARD TO THE ABILITY FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS INDEPENDENTLY OVERRIDE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AND CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR DID ELUCIDATE THAT TO DO SO A WORKER MUST NOW RECEIVE THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPERVISING POSITION. ONLY GREATLY APPRECIATE THIS CLARIFICATION. AND ASK THE AUTHORS OFFICE IS AWARE THERE REMAIN MINOR OUTLINED CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC DRAFTING OF THE LANGUAGE. THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO RESOLVING. ADDITIONALLY CMA IS STILL EXTREMELY CONCERNED REGARDING THE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT THIS BILL REQUIRES HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO HAVE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AROUND HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ALTERED. EVEN AS AMENDED THE BILL DOESN'T HESITATE HEALTH FACILITIES ALL HEALTH CARE WORKERS A LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND THE DESIGN. BUILD AND VALIDATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE FEEL IS NEITHER APPROPRIATE NOR PRACTICAL. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OFFERS OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH US TO ALLEVIATE OUR INITIAL APPREHENSIONS AND THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING NOT WORK. BUT UNTIL THE AFTER MENTIONED ISSUES ARE RESOLVED.

MISTER JOHN SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CMA- JUST A QUICK STORY WHY I'M EVEN INVOLVED IN THIS- MANY OF YOU KNEW. ME WHEN I WAS A LOT HEAVIER- WITH DIABETES. AND SOME OTHER HEALTH CHALLENGES- OVER A YEAR AGO. AND IT. I WAS TOLD I WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACK MAN. THAT I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER I WAS GOING TO HAVE DIABETES I WAS GOING TO HAVE ALL THE AILMENTS AND THEY GAVE ME DRUGS AND PILLS. I WANT TO PUT ME ON INSULIN- WHILE I WAS THERE BECAUSE THAT THE ALGORITHM THAT WAS THERE- BY TALK TO MY DOCTOR HE WAS FOLLOWING ALGORITHM. AND THEN A NURSE WITH THE LAST NAME OF DONALD- WHO SAYS.

NINE ONE THE BILL HAS NINE VOTES IS OUT WE'LL LEAVE WE'LL LEAVE THE ROLE OF THE FURTHER SAID ON THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. NEXT UP. MR LEVINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IF YOU FIFTEEN TWENTY WOULD ELIMINATE THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR PROSTATE PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING FOR INDIVIDUALS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER OR INDIVIDUALS TO FIND AS HIGH RISK. BLACK AS A FAMILY HISTORY OF PROSTATE CANCER A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO PROSTATE CANCER IS A VETERAN OR AS DETERMINED BY THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE NEARLY TWENTY SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER MAKING IT THE SECOND MOST DIAGNOSED CANCER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE MOST DIAGNOSED IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY A BLACK PERSON WITH A PROSTATE WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE WITH PROSTATE CANCER AT A RATE ALMOST 80% HIGHER THAN NON HISPANIC WHITE PEOPLE WITH PROSTATE AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ACCESS TO TESTING AND CARE- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL GROUP HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN OR HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY TO INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WHICH INCLUDES PREVENTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS PROSTATE CANCER SCREENINGS HOWEVER. THERE ARE STILL INSURED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR THE SCREENS. POSTURING IS AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO SCREEN FOR PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP. FOR DIAGNOSIS IF DETECTED EARLY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF PATIENTS WILL SURVIVE. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY WILL HELP TO ALLEVIATE THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER CAN GET GETTING. EARLY SCREENING AN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS GETTING TREATMENT. AND SAVING A LIFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING NOW MOVES TO THE WITNESSES WE HAVE TO REGISTERED WITNESSES AND SUPPORT- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MADAM- OPERATOR. THANK YOU YOUR LINER OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND GAS- DR JOHN LAMB I AM THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE TO THE AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE MANY PRACTICING UROLOGIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I MYSELF AND I AM A PRACTICING UROLOGIST IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY OF LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO GIVE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN TWENTY. PROSECUTORS THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN OMIT CALIFORNIA MAN. WITH THE ONE IN EIGHT MEN WHO WILL BE DIAGNOSED IN THEIR LIFETIME. ALTHOUGH PROSECUTORS ARE DOUBTS THAT BELIES IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE ADVANCES IN TREATMENT IN EARLIER STAGE DIAGNOSIS WAS SCREENING. DECLINE FROM PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN OR PSA TESTING FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY THE MISLEADING INFORMATION BASED ON OBSOLETE DATA AND HAVE COINCIDED WITH AN UPTICK IN THE DIAGNOSIS AFFECTED FRANCE PROSTATE CANCER. I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THIS IN MY OWN PRACTICE WHERE MEN ARE PRESENTING TO ME WITH INCURABLE METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A HOLD AND OFTEN MY PRIMARY CARE COLLEAGUES ASKED ME DOES THIS PROSTATE CANCER DO THIS. AND IF I'VE EVER SEEN THIS BEFORE AND I ONLY RESPOND IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS BACK BEFORE PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING WAS WIDESPREAD. A RECENT ANALYSIS FROM THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE PROJECTING THE IMPACT OF PSA SCREENING FROM THE WIDELY CITED. EUROPEAN RANDOMIZED STUDY OF SCREENING FOR PROSTATE CANCER TRIAL ESTIMATED THAT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MEN. WOULD HAVE TO BE SCREENED ON ELEVEN CASES OF PROSTATE CANCER WOULD NEED TO BE DIAGNOSED TO PREVENT ONE OF PROSTATE CANCER DEATHS OVER A TWENTY FIVE YEAR TIME SPAN. WHICH COMPARES FAVORABLY TO ANYTHING THAT WE DO IN PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE AND IS QUALITATIVELY SIMILAR TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS. SUPPORTING BREAST CANCER SCREENING. SO I A CLINICIAN WHO SCREAM. DIAGNOSE AND TREATS PATIENTS PROSTATE CANCER THE DALLAS IS A BENEFITS AND HARMS OF SCREENING MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE THAN GENERALLY APPRECIATED. CERTAINLY RESPECT AS AS WE'VE STATED SUCH AS RACE FAMILY HISTORY GENETIC PREDISPOSITION BEING A VETERAN. SIGNIFICANT RAISES THE PRICE INDIVIDUALS RISK OF DEVELOPING PROSTATE CANCER THUS MAKING THE AVAILABILITY OF EARLY DETECTION EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. BLACK MEN HAVE A TWO FOLD HIGHER RATE OF PROSTATE CANCER DEATHS AND PRESENT WITH MORE AGGRESSIVE DISEASE. AT YOUNGER AGES AND HAVE A HIGHER INCIDENCE COMPARED TO MEN OF OTHER RACES. THIS RACIAL DISPARITY IN DANCE IS CALLING THE WORST AMONG ALL CANCERS IN THE UNITED STATES. HAS STRATEGIES FOR CREATING RACIAL AND SOCIAL PARITY AND PROSECUTORS ARE NEED TO CONSIDER SCREENING STRATEGIES. TO MAXIMIZE THE EARLY DETECTION OF PROSTATE CANCER THAT NEED TREATMENT IN ORDER TO REDUCE TO THESE DEATHS. FURTHERMORE TREATMENT OF LATE STAGE PROSTATE CANCERS IN FACT. QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE AN INCREASE ECONOMIC BURDEN ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. INCLUDING WILL LOCK WILL ALSO WORKER PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASE FINANCIAL TOXICITY FOR THESE AFFECTED MEN. AND ALTHOUGH EXISTING LAW REQUIRES PLAN TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATE CANCER. IN THESE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES COPAYMENTS AND COINSURANCE THAT MAY DETER OR EVEN PRE THAT MAN ESPECIALLY THOSE IN LOW SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS OR IN UNDER SERVED POPULATIONS FROM UNDERGOING DETECTION OF EARLY STAGE PROSTATE CANCER. AND THUS IS A SOURCE OF DISPARITY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVAL. THUS THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL ELIMINATE THIS UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO SCREENING WHICH IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP FOR THE DIAGNOSIS. AND WILL SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY MEN. AT THE YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I WAS. ASK YOU TO. VOTE I. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH- MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS ON FOR THE BILL.

KIDS WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS AND ULTIMATELY THE STATE ENDED UP SENDING THOSE KIDS. OUT OF STATE. AND CERTIFYING VARIOUS NUMBERS OF FACILITIES. DUE TO SOME PROBLEMS OF THOSE FACILITIES THE STATE ENDED UP DECERTIFYING ALL OF THE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES AND BROUGHT THOSE KIDS BACK ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SOME ODD. AND THAT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHY CALIFORNIA CANNOT DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH ALL THOSE KIDS REGARDLESS OF LEVEL OF NEED IN STATE AND THAT'S WHAT AB EIGHT AWAIT IS ABOUT IT IS CREATING. A CRISIS SUPPORT FOR KIDS WITH THE HIGHEST MEANS IN THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AS WELL AS WITH HUMAN SERVICES IS IT COMBINES MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES AS WELL AS THIS GROUP CRISIS INTERVENTION FACILITY IN A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO SEE IF WE CAN REALLY FILL IN THE GAP AND DEVELOP THAT CAPACITY DEAL WITH THESE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. OBVIATING THE NEED TO SEND THEM OUT OF STATE WHICH WOULD BE ULTIMATELY A VERY GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT ABA DALY IS IT. THESE ARE. INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED TOWARDS THE KIDS. AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THERE WOULD BE SOME FAIRLY RAPID STEP DOWN. OUT OF THOSE AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEEDS OF THAT CHILD TO GET THEM INTO. BETTER INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENTS. WITH CRAIG THIS NOTION OF SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM S. T. R. T. P.'S. FOR KIDS TO GO INTO. SHOULD THEY NEED THAT LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE AS THEY ENTER THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THIS WOULD BE AN S. T. R. T. P. OF MAYBE ONE OR TWO BEDS AT THE MOST SO IT IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED TAILORED. TOWARDS THOSE KIDS OF THE HIGHEST NEEDS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FOR CALIFORNIANS DURING WE KEEP KIDS. HERE AT HOME AND CLOSE TO HOME INSTEAD OF SENDING THEM OUT OF STATE. AND WITH ME I'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. SEE FAQ IT WAS THE W. D. A. AND I. HAVE KATHY CENTER LINK OF THE CALIFORNIA WILL FOR DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND TEN BERWICK OF THE SENECA FAMILY AGENCIES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE SENICA. AS A PROVIDER OF FAMILY SERVICES. IS ONE OF THE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS WE WOULD NEED TO RELY ON TO CREATE THIS CAPACITY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MATTER OPERATIVE. OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBERT HALF A CENTURY LINK OUT ALL OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SHE GOT MEDIATED PLEASE GIVE ME A CO SPONSOR AB EIGHT AWAIT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE NOTED THE PURPOSE OF AB EIGHT OH WAIT HIS TURN GRAPHIC APP ON OUR SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE VERY SIGNIFICANT COMMA I HAVE SIGNIFICANT SERVICE NEEDS. FOR MANY YEARS EVEN CREATING CPR COUNTY THE STRUGGLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A SMALL GROUP OF VERY HIGHLY TRAUMATIZED YOU SEE IF YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BUILD CONTENT OF THOUGHTFUL SET OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS WILL HELP TO BUILD THEIR RESILIENCE AND HELP THEM OVERCOME THE TRAUMA THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED. THIS ISSUE CREATED THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WAS NOT FULLY ADDRESSED IN SUBSEQUENT IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. AS A RESULT OVER TIME LISTING SERVICE THINK HEIGHTENED FOR THE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU USE UP THE SERVICE ARRAY KEEPING TAKES. PROCEED TO BE A PRIVATE PRACTICE BY PONDERING EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY ALSO CO AUTHORED AB EIGHT AWAIT. AMONG OTHER THINGS AB TWENTY THREE REQUIRED THE STATE TO PERFORM A GAP ANALYSIS OF SERVICE. FOR USE WITH MORE COMPLEX NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THAT MEANS THAT ANALYSIS WAS NOT COMPLETED BY THE DEADLINE IN THE LEGISLATION AND OF BEHIND SCHEDULE. WHAT IS IN PROGRESS NOW WE HAVE QUITE FRANKLY LOST TIME AND LOST GROUND AND OUR CHILDREN IN. UNIFORM THE RESULTS ABOUT. WE KNOW COUNTY SIXTY OVER THESE YEARS THIS IS A FOR WHICH BETTER MORE. AND MORE CONCRETE SURVEY ARE YOU NOW. TO HELP I DON'T AND BUILD UNDER. AND HELP THEM RESULT TO ANY VOICE. FOR ALL. OR IF. INSURANCE INITIAL TERM. SO WE CAN GET THEM BACK IN A FAMILY SETTING AS WE TO PASS. DONE THE SO MANY OF THEIR PEERS. STEM PARTLY EIGHTY EIGHT- IT WOULD SO LET'S PULL IN THE HIGHER END OF THE CAN. WAS SERVICES ARE TO.

WE NEED A FAIR NEEDS AND BROUGHT PLACEMENT CHOICES TO. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN A WAY THAT THEY DO NOT EXIST TODAY SO WE CAN AVOID THESE OUT OF STATE. STE FINALLY THAT ALSO PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE INTENSIVE TREATMENT. FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY A STEP DOWN TO INTENSIFIED HOME BASED SERVICES. THE GOAL IS NOT TO SIMPLY CREATE A CONGREGATE CARE OPTIONS FOR YOU. AND THEN JUST LEAVE THEM THERE. THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE WE HAVE A TO CONTINUE ON FOR ALL OF THE- RESEARCH THAT WE STRIVE TO SUPPORT THEM IN HOME BASED SETTINGS AND THAT WE FILL THE GAP BETWEEN NOW EXIST. FOR THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF YOU PRETEND THAT. CONTINUUM FALL SHORT TODAY. WE REALLY HAVE. THE ALL FARAI. THE STAFF SPEARHEADING THE- AND FOR THE THREE WE URGE. THOUGHT ON THAT MEASURE I DON'T COURSE I'M HAPPY. AFTER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY TO MOVE ON TO THE- WITH. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MONIES CAN BE ERICA I'M THE CEO AND FOUNDER OF SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES. AND FROM OUR INCEPTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND I CAN START TO CREATE A CONTINUUM OF CARE. TO HELP CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO THEIR MOST DIFFICULT TIMES AND WE TRIED TO DO THAT. UNCONDITIONALLY WITH THE IDEA THAT NO MATTER WHAT NEED TO USE- HAS WILL BRING TO THE TABLE OR THEIR FAMILY THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT. TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT TIME. MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO WITH THE HELP OF THE IRVINE FOUNDATION- WE CONVENE A STAKEHOLDERS MEETING. OF SOME OF THE TOP THINKERS IN THE STATE ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO ABOUT THE GAPS IN CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. THAT WERE CAUSING US RATHER THAN FIGURING- CHILDREN IN- IN IN THE STATE. TO SEND THEM OUT OF STATE TO LARGE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND AWAY FROM THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS. AND THAT STAKEHOLDERS GROUP CAME UP WITH A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAS FOLLOWED ON- IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL'S INTERESTS RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT TALKED ABOUT A FULL CONTINUUM OF CRE- IN THAT CONTINUUM FOCUSES ON PREVENTION IT FOCUSES ON SERVICES LIKE WRAPAROUND AT THE CENTER OF THAT CONTINUUM. BUT IT ALSO FOCUSES ON VERY INTENSIVE SHORT TERM SERVICES. THE IS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS AND THE GREATEST RISK FOR SAFETY HI. THAT'S A REMAINING GAP IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT THE GAP IN THE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA TO SEND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. YOU TO OUT OF STATE THAT WE COULD HAVE SERVED IN STATE. AND CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILY AND CLOSE TO THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS. WHEN WE BROUGHT THE YOUNG PEOPLE BACK FROM OUT OF STATE THEN WE WHEN WE REALIZED THAT THAT THAT THE PLACEMENT WARRANT- THE DIRECTION. WE WANT TO FOLLOW THE STATE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WITH INTENSIVE ENOUGH. WRAPAROUND SUPPORT CAN WE CALL THEM- EXPEDITED SERVICES THAT WE COULD BRING MANY OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE HOME CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO FOUND. IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE. IT FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME HIGHLY. AND FARM IN. TYPE OF. THIS BILL BRINGS US TO CAL AND ALLOW US TO AGAIN. AND CAN IN THE WAY THAT WE- WITH AROUND HOME BASED SERVICES TENANTS. INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND BUT IT PROVIDE TO CONTINUE ON THAT SAYS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WE CAN SERVE YOU HERE IN THE STATE CALIFORNIANS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE C. R. WITH THE- LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION TO IMPLEMENT- FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEMS AS A WAY TO DIFFERENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM HOSPITALS AND MORE INTENSE IN SETTINGS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AT HOME. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE FINAL PIECES TO COMPLETE THE CONTINUUM AND THE PROMISE THAT WE MAKING THE CALIFORNIANS THAT WILL KEEP YOU HERE AND TURBULENT CONDITIONS AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU NEED TO ENTER THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES OF YOUR LIFE I URGE.

NINE DO I WHO HAVE A MOTION. MOTION BY MISTER MCCARTY SECOND BY MR BURKE MOTIONS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION MR STONE WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VISITOR MEMBERS AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE SEIZE CONCERNS I THINK ARE WELL TAKEN IT IN FOUNDED IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THOSE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE KIDS WERE BROUGHT NEEDED TO BE BRING BROUGHT BACK BECAUSE- OF THE DECERTIFICATION THOSE FACILITIES. THEY WERE ALMOST ALL PLACED WITH INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES AND THAT BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHY THEY WERE SENT OUT OF STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE BY THREE IS THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE. THE ALL THE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN DECERTIFIED BUT THE FACT IS THAT OF A COUNTY ASKS DSS TO CONSIDER ANOTHER PLACEMENT OUT OF STATE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF THE CERTIFIED. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE AN OPTION HERE AS THE S. AS DOES THE GAP ANALYSIS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A REAL OPTION. THAT PROVIDES THAT THAT KIND OF A PLACEMENT THAT. CARRIES ARE CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MAKES THEM WANT TO LOOK. OUT OF STATE AND THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THING WORKING ON IS A IS A BUDGET. ASK AS WELL TO INVEST IN THIS CAPACITY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE AND I AM NOT. GOING TO ENCOURAGE IT A PROLIFERATION OF THE NUMBER OF BEDS. BECAUSE IF WE BUILD THOSE BEDS WE WILL FILL THEM AND THAT IS ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE KIDS IN STATE. THEY GET THE LEVEL OF SERVICE WHATEVER THEY NEED ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS. PLAYED AN INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS. SO THAT THEY CAN STAY IN STATE. GET THE MEET THEIR NEEDS ADDRESSED AND BE PUT INTO AN APPROPRIATE FAMILY PLACEMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS PILOT. IS ABOUT BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE THOUGHTFULLY. CAREFULLY NEED TO BE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED. AND I THINK IT IS IT IS. PAST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA REALLY LOOKED. HARD AT WHAT CAPACITY WE HAVE. ASKED THOSE HARD QUESTIONS THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT WAS ABOUT AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. HAVE A- THINK THINK YOU MISTER STONE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY- FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

WALDRON WALDRON AYE CALDERON CALDERON I. IT'S TEN ZERO TEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER STAND ON THANK YOU MR STONE. MISS AGUIAR-CURRY SURE NOW MOVING TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB THIRTY TWO ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING TIRELESSLY WITH MY STAFF AND SPONSORS. ON MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECLARED A NATIONAL STATE OF EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN VIRUS. IT OOK A PANDEMIC TO REALIZE WE NEED TO FIND AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE WAYS TO ENSURE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. BY ALLOWING MORE FLEXIBILITY PATIENTS COULD CONTINUE TO SEE THEIR PROVIDERS CREATING A BRIDGE TO EXPAND ACCESS IN MORE NORMAL TIMES. AB THIRTY TWO MAKES THIS FLEXIBILITY TO ACCESS OUR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MORE PERMANENT SO THAT ACCESS DOESN'T GO AWAY WITH THE PANDEMIC. WELL THE PANDEMIC HAS LED TO DISRUPTIONS IN PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE OF CARE TELEHEALTH SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA CARE HAS ALLOWED PROVIDERS TO BRING CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS. AND WHILE VIRTUAL CARE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT REPLACE IN PERSON CARE. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE TELEHEALTH EXPEDIA ACCESS TO CARE I WILL FOSTER MORE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM AB THIRTY TWO WILL INCREASE HEALTHCARE HEALTH CARE TAXES WELL THE DISC DECREASING DISPARITIES CREATED BY INCOME. RACE AND ETHNICITY LACK OF MOBILITY A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE TECHNOLOGY BASED BARRIERS. I PERSONALLY HAVE GOTTEN A GREAT DEAL OF FEEDBACK FROM CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THE TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER. STUDENTS ENTERING THE HEALTH WORKFORCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME AND JOIN THE FRONT LINES BECAUSE TELEHEALTH ALLOWED THEM TO SATISFY THE REQUIRED CLINICAL HOURS. SAFETY NET PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE- AND HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN THOSE SHOWS. IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LACK ACCESS TO RELIABLE. ALL THE PROVIDERS AND HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL. AN ELDERLY COMMUNITIES WHERE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A CHALLENGE TELEPHONIC CARE HAS MADE IT EASIER TO ACCESS SERVICES. STAY AT HOME PARENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE ARE ABLE TO SPEAK TO PROVIDERS VIA VIDEO OR PHONE. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE NOT HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING TIME OFF AND TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. POLITICS TELEHEALTH IS REVOLUTIONIZING HOW WE PROVIDE SAFE. EQUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE. IT IS A CRITICAL TOOL IN OUR HEALTH TOOLBOX. PLEASE JOIN ME IN OUR TELEHEALTH COALITION IN CHAMPIONING THIS EXPANSION OF OPTIONS FOR A CONSTITUENT PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS INCREASING ACCESS IN BOTH PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE. AND REDUCTION OF THE BARRIERS TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED TO LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS DOCTOR MELISSA MARSHALL CEO OF COMMUNICATOR HELP CENTER. AND DR ANAYA WHO IS THE ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UCLA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO THE- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR MELISSA MARSHALL. I AM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMMUNICATOR HOLE CENTERS A NONPROFIT MULTISITE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER TO PROVIDE CARE TO OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS REGULAR COUNTY. I'M ALSO A FAMILY MAN METAPHYSICIAN TWENTY YEARS AND A PROUD BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. COMMUNICATOR LIKE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE IS PROUD OF HOW QUICKLY WE TRANSITIONED OUR KAREN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY. TO GUARANTEE TIMELY QUALITY ACCESS TO CARE. KEY TO OUR SUCCESS FOR THE POLICY FLEXIBILITIES AND PAYMENT FOR MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDED USING TELEHEALTH INCLUDING AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES. COMMUNICATOR HAS PROVIDED OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TELEHEALTH VISITS AS PART OF OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE. 3% WILL BUY VIDEO VIDEO VISITS ARE CHALLENGING FOR MANY REASONS BUT WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE LONGER LENGTH OF VISITS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TROUBLESHOOT ISSUES WITH TECHNOLOGY. WITH OUR QUICK ACTIONS TO WATCH TELEHEALTH OUR PATIENTS REPORTED FEELING SAFE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISSING WORK FOR TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS THAT ARISE WHEN NEEDING TO TRAVEL IN PERSON FOR CARE. TELEHEALTH INCLUDING ACCESS TO AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES THAT ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAVE THE POWER TO BE A GREAT EQUALIZER. TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. AS A CEO AND FORMER CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER QUALITY AND CLINICAL APPROPRIATENESS MATTER DEEPLY TO ME I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERN ABOUT A REDUCTION IN QUALITY DUE TO TELEHEALTH THE COMMUNICATOR MAINTAINED ITS STRONG PERFORMANCE IN PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLANS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE IN THE TOP FIVE FOR CLINICAL QUALITY OUT OF A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS FOURTEEN COUNTIES. I AM HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY POLICY CHANGES. TO ALLOW HEALTH CENTERS LIKE US TO CONTINUE THESE FLEXIBILITIES POST ENDEMIC. WITH THE LEGISLATION'S BRIDGE PERIOD FOR HEALTH CENTERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT PAYMENT WALLET VALUE WAITING TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION IN A NON PANDEMIC PERIOD. THIS LEGISLATION PREPARES HEALTH CENTERS FOR THE FUTURE AND RECOGNIZES THE ROLE OF TELEHEALTH AND EVALUE BASED ENVIRONMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS THE HEALTH EQUITY ISSUE. AS A PRIVATE PATIENT KAISER I CAN HAVE A TELEPHONE TO THAT WITH MY PROVIDER. STATION HEALTH CENTERS DESERVE THE SAME. 77% OF OUR PATIENTS SURVEYED STRONGLY AGREED THAT TELEHEALTH MADE IT EASIER TO SEE THEIR PROVIDER. THE FACT THAT THIS LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR PHONE VISITS RECOGNIZES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. BROADBAND AND INTERNET LIMITATIONS ARE REAL EVEN FOR THOSE THAT DO HAVE PROPER DEVICES TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNOLOGY WITH PATIENTS HAS BEEN TIME CONSUMING FOR BOTH PARTIES. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED MORE NO SHOWS FOR VIDEO VISITS OVER FROM DOESN'T. IN AN INFORMAL SURVEY WITH OUR PATIENTS THEY REPORTED THAT THEY PREFER PHONE TO VIDEO AT GENIE IS OUT OF THE BOTTLE WE CAN MAINTAIN TELEHEALTH AND MAINTAIN QUALITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PATIENTS. FOR THESE REASONS I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES AND THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOUR CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR YOU ALI AND I AM. AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UCLA AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE. IN THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF LATINO HEALTH AND CULTURE WITH MY PARTNER FOR RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT. OF TELEHEALTH INTOLERABLE POPULATIONS SOME OF WHICH I SHARED WITH YOU AT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON TELEPHONE POLICY IN FEBRUARY. AS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN FOR DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION EDUCATOR AND FAMILY MEDICINE AND RESEARCH ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF MY PATIENTS TODAY. THE PANDEMIC BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE INADEQUACY OF OUR COUNTRY'S EXISTING TELEHEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THE INEFFICIENCIES AND REIMBURSEMENT RULES IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS. THE LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR TELEPHONE VISIT CREATED FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS FOR PRACTICES AS WE MOVE TO PROVIDING THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESS YOUR TELEHEALTH. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED PHYSICIANS WHO ARE CARING. FOR ALREADY UNDERSERVED PATIENT. FRANKLY FIFTY THREE HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO ENSURE TELL HEALTH CARE WITH ABLE TO BE DELIVERED. WHAT IF. AND AFTER WITH. THE TEMPORARY POLICY ADMIN CHANGE THAT CAN. MAY IN RESPONSE TO THE TENDER. ALLOWED PER PATIENT CARE ACCESS THAT CARE. COVERAGE AND PAYMENT PARITY FOR TELEPHONE ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC CARE. AND TO BRIDGE THE DELAYS IN CARE ABOUT THE PANDEMIC DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY HAS LED TO. A REALITY WE HAVE COME TO BECOME MORE ACUTELY AWARE OF WITH THE ADVENT OF TELEHEALTH IS THAT NOT EVERYONE HAD CONNECTIVITY. COVERAGE AND PAYMENT PARITY FOR AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH AND THAT. ALLOWS THEM OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS ARE ELDERLY PATIENTS ARE PATIENTS WITHOUT COMPUTERS ARE PATIENTS WITHOUT PRIOR DIGITAL SKILLS. ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO CARE FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES. EVEN IF A CLINIC TO MINIMIZING ANY POTENTIAL RISK OF COLD EXPOSURE FOR OUR PATIENTS MANY PATIENTS STILL RELY. ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR CATCHING A RIDE WITH A NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND WHICH LEADS TO EXPOSURE. BUT THE OUR OUR PATIENTS COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PROVIDERS AND THE MODALITY THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WHEN CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY. ENSURING EQUITY AND ACCESS FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS INCLUDING THOSE MOST VULNERABLE WILL BE KEY TO IMPROVE LONG TERM OUTCOMES. WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND REDUCE LONG TERM HEALTH CARE COSTS. IT'S REQUIRED THAT BE THOUGHT BOTH IN PERSON AND NOT A DIFFERENCE FOR ALL INTO THE- OKAY. REIMBURSEMENT FOR INTERNET. FUNDAMENTALS PROVIDING. TO PAY IN THE NET TELL HOW AT LEAST THE SHORT TERM. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHILE WE BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE THEM VIA VIRTUAL BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM. HAPPEN CURRENT RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THE WAYS IN WHICH INTEGRATED TELEHEALTH CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRADITIONAL% CARE. IT CARRIED OUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PATIENTS HELLO HOPE GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT. TO A CERTAIN. DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY CARE WE WILL NEED TO AND TELEHEALTH DELIVERY. FOR EQUITABLE ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY STRATEGIZING ON WAYS TO ENSURE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LEAVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS BEHIND. WILL NEED TO PROMOTE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE QUALITY OF CARE STANDARDS THAT APPLY WHETHER CARE IS. PROVIDED VIRTUALLY OR IN PERSON AND OVER TIME CAN DETERMINE. BEST PRACTICES FOR THE RIGHT MIX OF IN PERSON AND TELL HEALTHCARE. BECAUSE THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COVERAGE AND SUFFICIENT PAYMENT FOR TELEHEALTH. INCLUDING AUDIO ONLY ENCOUNTER ALL PEACE AND ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR CONTINUED EVALUATION AND RESEARCH TO ENSURE THAT WE TO PROVIDE. HIGH QUALITY CARE TO ALL PATIENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER HOW WE CAN PROMOTE TELEHEALTH SERVICES HAT WE CAN HELP ADDRESS. AND CAREFULLY AVOID FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO INEQUITIES WITHIN OUR NEW ERA OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THESE JOBS ALONE AND IT TOOK A TEAM AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK FROM THE BOTTOM MY HEART. AS WELL AS MY WHOLE STUFF AND WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL TO GET IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE HOPE WE WILL DO SO TODAY- YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL. LET'S REMEMBER COLLEAGUES. TELEHEALTH IS REVOLUTIONIZING HOW WE PROVIDE SAFE EQUITABLE. AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND I SIMPLY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU.

MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN. NAZARIAN AYE RIVAS. RODRIGUEZ VEGAS I'VE SANTIAGO. WALDRON WALDRON AYE CALDERON CALDERON HI. SEVEN ZERO NEEDS ONE MORE ONE MORE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE COMMITTEES WILL SLIDE SLIDE RIGHT NOW SO- WITH THAT- BELIEVE YOUR BILL ACCOMPLISHES- PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR NEXT BILL AB FORTY FIVE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK ON THIS MEASURE. AB FORTY FIVE CREATES A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN FOODS BEVERAGES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IF LIMITS HEMP PRODUCTION PRODUCTS TO CONTAINING NO MORE THAN THREE TENTHS OF PERCENT THC. REQUIRES THAT HIM PRODUCES BE SUBJECT TO TESTING AND LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BECAUSE ME FEDERAL FARM BILL HER FIGHT THAT INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. I'M REMOVED INGREDIENTS AND HELP FROM THE FEDERAL DRUG FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULES. THIS ACTION CLASSIFIED HEMP INGREDIENTS AS GENERALLY SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND OPEN THE DOORS FOR FARMERS TO CULTIVATE INDUSTRIAL HEMP. CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED CANNABIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THE CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL. IRONICALLY WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REMOVED BARRIERS TO THE LEGAL USE OF HAMPER DERIVED PRODUCTS INCLUDING CBD CALIFORNIA HAS NOT TAKEN A SIMILAR APPROACH. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOOD AND DRINKS YEAH ONE OF HIM IS THE SOURCE OF CBD TO BE ADDED TO FOOD PRODUCTS IT IS PROHIBITED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PURCHASING HIM DERIVE CBD PRODUCTS AT THE LOCAL NATURAL FOODS SHOPS. FITNESS CENTERS AND EVEN HIGH END DEPARTMENT STORES FOR SOME TIME. AND THIS IS A LEGAL. IN FACT SENIORS ARE-A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE PEOPLE CHOOSING TO USE HEMP CBD. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO VISIT THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY. THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF CBD DERIVED FROM HEMP-IS A RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. SHOULD THE STATE CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THAT HEMP CBD PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL FOR SALE AND CONSUMPTION BUSINESSES AND THEIR TAX REVENUES ARE LOST. WE HAVE A WILD WILD WEST FOR CBD PRODUCTS NOW ONLINE AND IN STORES UNWITTINGLY FILLING ON REGULATED PRODUCTS. I DON'T WANT MY CONSTITUENTS BY UNTESTED UNREGULATED OUT OF STATE FOR FOREIGN PRODUCTS. THEY ARE UNSAFE. WHILE OUR FARMERS AND BUSINESSES LOSE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AB FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS A NON INTOXICATING ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT CONSUMERS WANT AND FOR FARMERS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A FAST GROWING INDUSTRY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE RAN MARTIN REPRESENTING THE U. S. CAMP ROUND TABLE AND AMY JACK JENKINS REVERSING THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU RUN THEM OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESS IN SUPPORT. WE'LL AND WE'LL WE'LL GO TO THE AS WELL THAT'S WILL GO TO THE GALLERY FOR SO- THINKING PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. THE CHAIR MEMBERS RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE AND CMG KHALIFA. I JUST LIKE TO MAKE THREE POINTS TODAY. ONE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALREADY ALLOWS. THE STATE TO THEIR ALL AUTHORIZES THE- MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS TO SELL- TEXTURES CREAMS TOPICALS THAT HAVE HIM CVD. IT DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO INCLUDED IN FOOD AND BEVERAGES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OR INTENT PRODUCTS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THAT AND WOOD PULLED ALL THOSE PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE ONES THE SAME REGULATORY STRUCTURE. I NUMBER TWO YOU WILL SOLVE THIS BILL LAST SESSION IN AB TWO TWO EIGHT I'M PASSING UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH WE APPRECIATE IT. I SAY THAT I BRING THAT UP TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY MUCH STRONGER VERSION THAN THE ONE THAT YOU WILL PASSED LAST SESSION- WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST YEAR. TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE ANDS AND GRANULARITY- THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT EVEN SAFER- FOR CONSUMERSINCLUDING SOME VERY PROFOUND- PROVISIONS RELATIVE TO- TO TESTING. WHICH WOULD MAKE SURE THAT CAN SEE BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE TESTED EXACTLY. THE SAME AS CANNABIS PRODUCTS OR- THE THIRD POINT I WANT TO TODAY'S THAT THIS ISN'T. THING FOR THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA- THERE ARE NATIONAL PROJECTIONS ABOUT HIM CVD THAT SAYS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. NATIONALLY THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS THAT MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA ONCE WE HAVE THIS IN PLACE. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY OVER THE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WITH ALL THE REQUISITE JOB CREATION AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS- TAX REVENUES. WHEN WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS LIKE THE FARM BUREAU. WORKING WITH THEM AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY AND RESOLVE THEIR CONCERN THOSE CONCERNS. WE'RE CONFIDENT WE'LL BE ABLE TO- TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ANYTHING CAN FINALLY HAPPEN THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CIA WE ARE PLEASED TO BE PART OF THE OF THE SERVER COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE P. FORTY FIVE AS A MEMBER OF THE COALITION IS HELPED SHAPE THE BILL TO ENSURE THE INTERESTS OF OUR OVER FOUR HUNDRED CANNABIS INDUSTRY NUMBER THIRTY FOUR. EIGHTY FORTY FIVE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL AND IT DOUBLES AS A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR HAND MANUFACTURING REQUIRING OPERATORS TO ADHERE TO STRICT NEW CONSUMER STATE STANDARDS INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE POPPING PROTOCOL THE MILLER TO THE STATE'S REQUIREMENT FOR CANADA WHICH WILL ENSURE A LEVEL OF BT AND PEACE OF MIND CURRENTLY AFFORDED TO CANNABIS CONSUMERS. IT HAD REGULAR CONSUMER SAFETY PROTOCOLS INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND LABELING STANDARDS BASED ON EXISTING STANDARDS FOR CANNABIS I'M NOT PLEASE ENSURE THE ONGOING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION AMONG HEMP AND CANNABIS LICENSING AGENCIES. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITATE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT AGAIN UNLIKE. MANY FACTORS I'M A PREVIOUSLY NOTED- BY RAND MARTIN B. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER PROVISION- THAT WE ARE WORKING ON. AND CAN MAKE THE BILL EVEN STRONGER CLARIFY QUESTIONS THAT MAYBE AND CLEAR AND ENSURE THE PROTECTION AND VIABILITY OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND THE CROP AT. THIS USED TO INCLUDE CLOSING ANY REMAINING RECALL TO ENSURE THAT ALL PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOID ARE PROHIBITED AND HEALTH PRODUCTS DEVELOPING AN COUPLE POCKET FROM THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF MOBILE AND HELPFUL PRODUCTS. AND ESTABLISHING A CLEAR AND BALANCED PROCESS AND PATHWAY FOR THE INCORPORATION OF KIND INTO THE COUNTER THAT THE FIGHT SCENE BOB THE PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF KIND OF THE OPERATOR AND STATE BECAME WISHES TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR HER ONGOING AND THOUGHTFUL COLLABORATION WITH THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THESE. AND OTHER. CRITICAL PRIORITY AND REQUIRE YOUR I VOTE FOR A FORTY FIVE. WHICH REPRESENTS AN STEP TOWARD BUILDING A STRONG HAND AND KIND OF THAT INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA LASTLY I NOTE. OCTOBER EVEN ON BEHALF OF EVEN THAT THANK YOUNG THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE OPPOSITION PLEASE I BELIEVE HAVE ONE REGISTER OPPOSITION WITNESS. MESSAGES INCLUDING. MY NAME IS TAIWO ON A PRO TO THE CAN BUSINESS. ON BEHALF OF A LARGE CO OF ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS HUNDREDS OF LIKE YOU CAN ADOPT GREATER YOU'RE ALL HERE ENOUGH AND AMENDED POSITION OF FORTY FIVE AND A CURRENT FORM. WE RECOGNIZE THE INTENTION TO MAYBE FORTY FIVE POWER THEIR UNINTENDED. CONSEQUENCES. SHOULD THE BILL PASSED WITHOUT AMENDMENT. AND IN CANADA PLANS ARE ONLY GOOD BY AMOUNT OF DELTON THC THE PLANT MAY PART. BETTER OTHERWISE I. BOTH PRODUCE THE SAME CAMERA NOISE SUCH AS CBD AND THC. ARE ONLY TWO OF UNDER OF OVER A HUNDRED KNOWN CANONIZED ITS CURRENT FORM AB 45% A CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT BY ALLOWING YOU FACT THAT. THE PSYCHOACTIVE PRODUCT BUDGET I MEAN THERE INDEED THE CAMERA NOISE KNOWN AS DELTA EIGHT. AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF AB FORTY FIVE PASSING ALLOWED FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE IMMEDIATELY SOLD TO UNDERAGE CONSUMERS TO RETAILERS SUCH AS GAP NATION MONKEY ON. THE FLOOR AND OTHER RETAILERS CAN ONLY BE IN THE SAME WEATHER HAMPER CANNABIS DERIVED MUCH REQUIRE SEEN SIXTY SEVEN. EIGHTY FORTY FIVE DOES NOT ESTABLISHED AFTER REQUIREMENTS IN FULL PARITY WITH CANISTER I CAME IN I PRODUCT AND THOSE CANDIDATES I THINK THE OWNERS HAVE BEEN DEBATED THROUGH CANNABIS REGULATIONS FOR YEARS NOW. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE ANY CONSUMERS FINAL FORM TESTING TO ENSURE THE PRODUCT AND NOT LEAST ANY HEAVY METAL FURTHER TALKS WITH FROM THE PACKAGING AND LABEL CLAIMS ARE ACCURATE. LACK OF PARITY IN TESTING EAGLE TO CANADA SAFETY TESTING REQUIREMENTS BRIGHTON PUBLIC OUT IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE TV MARKET ACHIEVED OVER SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES AND IS EXPECTED TO REACH TWO BILLION DOLLARS WENT DOWN BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. EIGHTY FORTY FIVE HAD WRITTEN PRESUMABLY UNINTENTIONALLY MISSES OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE MUCH NEEDED ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE. FOR STATE SIMILAR TO HOW CANISTER I CAN WHEN I CAN TAP NOW. WHEN THE ATTACK SUCH AS ONE TEN PER MILLIGRAM. CANDLELIGHT CAN GENERATE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE PER YEAR IN STATE TAX REVENUE. ACHIEVING TAX COMPARED WITH CANADA CAN ONLY LEAVE THE LEVEL COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE FOR ALL HUMANOIDS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIGIN. AB FORTY FIVE SHOULD BE AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE TAX EXEMPT RIGHT CAN ONLY PRODUCT AS WELL AS TO ALLOW THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO INCORPORATE HEMP DERIVED CANNABINOID PRODUCTS WITHIN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN. TO ENSURE A FAIR MARKET START PROMOTE THE VIABILITY. OF BOTH THE HEMP AND CANNABIS INDUSTRY WITHOUT THE PROVISION CAMP RETAIL WOULD BE ONLY REACH. IN THIS TO HAVE THE FISCAL. ADDRESSING GONNA COMP.

IN ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT FOR YOLO COUNTY TO CREATE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM CALLED HOPE YOU ALL OF. THIS IS A PROGRAM INDIVIDUALS CAN- GET- DRUG TREATMENT AS OPPOSED TO BEING INCARCERATED SO IT'S A CHOICE SO IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS SENTENCED FOR- FELONIES RELATED TO THEIR- DRUG ADDICTION AGAIN AS MR RODRIGUEZ SAID THERE ARE THERE ARE NO VIOLENT FELONIES OR- SEX RELATED CRIMES- FOR THIS MEASURE- INDIVIDUALS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A TREATMENT RATHER THAN INCARCERATION BECAUSE WE KNOW. OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTY JAILS DON'T HAVE A ROBUST TREATMENT PROGRAM AND SO OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE JUST CIRCLE IN AND OUT AND NEVER GET THEIR UNDERLYING DRUG TREATMENT- ADDRESSED WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM HERE IN OUR STATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY GREAT SOLUTIONS TO WHAT WE SEE PEOPLE CIRCLING THROUGH. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE ADDRESSED IN OUR STATE AND COUNTY INCARCERATION FACILITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- WE DID ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT STATE THAT THIS- PROCESS NEEDS TO BE- BASED ON SCIENCE AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS BASE ARE. BASED UPON THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE- ONCE TREATMENT IS COMPLETED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS ONCE THEY CHOOSE TO DO THIS THEY'LL HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE THEIR RECORDS EXPUNGED YEAH WE DO TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW ON THE STREET.

THIS IS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF REISIG OF YOLO COUNTY- TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. ARE GOING TO PRISONS AND JAILS. TIMES ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION AND PRISONS AND JAILS ARE SIMPLY NOT PLACES WHERE PEOPLE. WHO ARE SICK. GO TO GET BETTER. AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY STATUS. WE'RE SIMPLY NOT HAVING A LOT OF LUCK IN CALIFORNIA THE DRESSING THIS POPULATION. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY GOING IN AND OUT OF REVOLVING DOOR. SO WOULD PETE BETWEEN FORTY TO PROPOSES. IS A LOCAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES PRISON IN JAIL FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY LEVEL CRIMES WHICH WERE MOTIVATED. BINDER SERIES ADDICTION TO DRUGS BUT COMPOSED. TOO MUCH OF A RISK FOR EXPOSURE TO SIMPLY RELEASE THEM. INTO AN UNSECURED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY CAN SIMPLY WALK AWAY OR CRAWL OUT A WINDOW ON DAY ONE. AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. SO INSTEAD EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TWO ENVISIONS CREATING A SECURE. HOSPITAL LIKE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT JAILS IN BARS AND GUARDS AND GUNS. THEY CAN SERVE AS A SANCTUARY FOR SERIOUSLY ADDICTED FELONY OFFENDERS. WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO TRY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES. IN A SAFE AND SECURE SAID SETTING INSTEAD OF MERELY IN WAREHOUSE BEHIND BARS. WE CALL THIS PLACE HOPE YELLOW. WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE VIEWS NEED TO THE DESIGN STAFF BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THEY WILL DECIDE. WHO'S AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE WHO IS NOT WHAT THE TREATMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND FOR THOSE WHO SUCCESSFULLY CHOOSING COMPLETE THE TREATMENT PROGRAM- INSTEAD OF PRISON OR JAIL THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED AND GET A CLEAN START. RIGHT HERE AT HOME IN YOUR ACCOUNTING. OKAY EIGHTY DID FORTY THOUSAND MUCH PILOT. YOUR ANNUAL- THAT IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE. TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON OR JAIL. I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THIS PILOT PROGRAM A CHANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. PLEASE GO AHEAD. AT THE BROWN. OKAY ONE MOMENT PLEASE OKAY YEAH I GOT IT HERE IS AT THIRTY BROWN YOUR LINE IS OPEN- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND WEBER MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS ASHLEY BROWN.

CLICK HELP NURSES AND IN ADDICTION TREATMENT COUNSELOR- AND ANGER MANAGEMENT FACILITATOR AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. I ALSO HOLD A DEGREE AND- SUCH AS AN ARCHITECT IN THE FINANCE AND A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN NURSING I'M CURRENTLY FULL TIME EMPLOYED AS THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING SERVICES. AT ALL THANK YOU THE BILL ANY AS WELL AS A PROFESSOR AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE REASON WHY I IDENTIFY AS THE FIRST IS PRIOR TO ANY OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENT I ALSO HAD THE PDP NUMBER AT EIGHT SEVEN TWO SIX NINE NINE. I SPENT FROM NINETEEN NINETY TO TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IMPOSSIBLE THE FACT THAT. OUR TRUCK ABOUT CHUCKLE OUT OF POLITICS PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN OFF THE PRESIDENT. KERN VALLEY STATE PRISON ACCOUNT FOR YOUR TICKET BERMAN THE NAME OF CO I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE HAD I BEEN OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR TO PICK YOUR TREATMENT BUT THE- HAVING TO DO A- PROGRAM OF PRIVATE PRISONS MAYBE THE OUTCOME. WILL BE CONTINUED TO RETURN BACK TO FOR THE PRETTY GOOD MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT I DO KNOW THAT WE GET FROM WHERE WHAT WHERE I'M AT NOW- THERE WAS NO EXPUNGEMENT MY RECORD I HAD TO GO TOO MANY- COURT APPEARANCES DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE THINGS AND I CAN TAKE COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT IT IS THAT I DID DEAL HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROGRAM BACK TO THE ONE OFTEN AND EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TWO. TWO AT THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER GET THEIR LIFE BACK IN ORDER I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT K. POP WROTE AS I DID I REALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU ARE GOING UP THERE ARE NONE CURRENTLY REPORTED BILL. THANK. YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL PRITCHARD AND I'M SPEAKING AS THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS- I AM A PERSON IN LONG TERM RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND I'M ALSO FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS- SHE GOT ALREADY SUBMITTED IN OPPOSITION. LETTER TO THIS BILL BUT I WOULD LIKE I'D LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL POINTS OF OPPOSITION. THE FIRST POINT OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS THE TERM PILOT PROGRAM- MENTAL HEALTH STD TREATMENT HAVE OPERATED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SETTINGS FOR DECADES AND THERE'S REALLY NO STRONG EVIDENCE OF LONG TERM POSITIVE RESULTS. BECAUSE THERE'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A SAFE THERAPEUTIC ATMOSPHERE INSIDE OF THE FOURTH LOCKDOWN FACILITY. LOCKDOWN TREATMENT IS PUNISHMENT EVEN IF IT HAS A TREATMENT LEGAL. DURING THE WAR ON DRUGS PEOPLE WHO. PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY- INCARCERATED FOR ADDICTION ISSUES AND MAINLY. ETHNIC MINORITY. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE ODS WAY FOR CALIFORNIANS MOVED AWAY FROM COURSE OF- CARE AND ARBITRARY TREATMENT- I'M TYPING TO TURN. ALTHOUGH THE- FIRST AMENDMENT USES THE TERM ASEM ASEM CONTINUUM DOES NOT HAVE A LOCKDOWN LEVEL OF CARE IN ADDITION THE STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM IS TAKING THE BILL WITH NO MENTION OF WEBSITE INTO T. WILL AUDIT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH BEST PRACTICES. IN THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY ADMISSION TO ANY LEVEL OF TREATMENT BASED SOLELY ON THE DETERMINATION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY ACCORDING TO THE DSM AND THE SECRETARY. SHE GAP IS CONCERNED THAT AB FOURTEEN FIFTY TO CREATE UNPARALLELED ABILITY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES T. INFLUENCE MEDICAL DECISION MAKING TO CREATE THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF LOCKING UP PROBLEM PETTY OFFENDERS. THE BILL EXCLUDES VIOLENT CRIME HIGH LEVEL FELONIES SEX OFFENDERS. THOSE WHO PUBLIC ACTUAL POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICAL HARMS IN OUR COMMUNITY AB FOURTEEN FIFTY TWO IS A NEW WAY TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUSING ECONOMIC HARM ENDPOINTS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE FORM OF THAT. VANDALISM LOITERING DISORDERLY CONDUCT THE HOMELESSNESS. OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS UNCONTROLLED DIABETES AND OBESITY AND OBESITY COSTS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUSLY IMPACT ALL OF US ECONOMICALLY SHOULD WE IMPRISON THESE PEOPLE WITH THESE MEDICAL ISSUES UNTIL THEY LEARN TO MANAGE THEM PROPERLY IN ORDER TO. SAVE HUMANITY STRONGER ECONOMIC HARM THEY POSE. SHE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT AB FOURTEEN FIFTY TWO IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ODS WEAVER A PERSON'S RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION. AND IS A RETURN TO INEFFECTIVE HARMFUL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF DEALING WITH THE. DISEASE DETECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WITNESS. GOOD EVENING WAY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME CALORIES IN L. MACHINE STAFF WITH DRUG-POLICY- ALLIANCE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO THE COMMITTEE CAN KNOW IS THAT THIS BILL IS OPPOSED BY EVERY STATE TREATMENT ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. PROFESSIONALS AND PEOPLE IN RECOVERY WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS OPPOSE THIS BILL. THE SIGN DID NOT SUPPORT THE EFFICACY. OF COMMERCE TREATMENT IN LOCKED FACILITIES. WE DO NOT DISAGREE. THAT SHOULD BE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. HOWEVER EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TO REPRESENT AND MISGUIDED APPROACH PROJECT PREVENTING SERIOUS INJURIES AND WILL BE A MAJOR STEP BACKWARD. IT DESCRIBED AS THE PILOT I KNEW I KNEW IDEA WE'RE TESTING. BUT IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS. RESEARCH SPANNING DECADES HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF COMMERCE TREATMENT AND ESPECIALLY JOHN INEFFECTIVENESS. AND CRYSTAL SET. WHAT WORKS IT ITS AFFORDABLE ACCEPT SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY. WITHOUT COMMUNITY BASED CARE THERE IS NO SUCCESS WE DON'T NEED A NEW JAIL LIKE SETTING TO DO THAT. WHICH TREATMENT VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT TO BODILY AUTONOMY AND PRIVACY IN HEALTH DECISION. COURSE TREATMENT CAN DAMAGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATMENT PROVIDER AND RECIPIENT. AND FURTHER TRAUMATIZED INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTEN EXPERIENCE SEVERE HARDSHIP DIMINISHING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FROM THE CURRENT TREATMENT AS WELL AS ENGAGEMENT AND FUTURE HEALTH SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD PLAY HEALTH DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS RATHER THAN TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS. WE ALSO FEAR EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WILL BE APPLIED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER. AND THEIR NATION RECKONS WITH POLICING AND HAVE LONG COURSE INSTEAD THE EFFECTS ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE TO PURSUE POLICIES THAT ONLY GIVE MORE LEVERAGE TO POLICE AND PROSECUTORS. IN A PROFESSIONAL RECOMMEND MOVING AWAY FROM COERCION TOWARDS APPROACHES THAT WORK INCLUDING ROBERT YOUR COMMUNITY TREATMENT MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER. HARM REDUCTION SOBERING CENTERS AND OUTREACH. THE EVIDENCE FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN THREE MINUTES ROBUST. UNLIKE THE EVIDENCE CARE COERCED TREATMENT. EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WITH THE TRACK FROM THE VETERANS AND DIVERT RESOURCES THAT COULD BE BETTER USED IN THE COMMUNITY. RECOGNIZING ALL THE DANGERS EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY TWO THE BALLOT BY ALL THE MAJOR SEVENTY DISORDER TREATMENT ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS CRIMINAL JUSTICE RACIAL JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. WE STAND WITH ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR OPPOSITION THIS BILL THANK YOU.

PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH SO I TRY TO TAKE A LOT OF NOTES THERE AND IT IS GOINGTO DRESS IN THIS IN THE CLOTHES I THINK WE CAN HERE I JUST THINK THIS IS- A RESPONSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING WE HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ARRESTED FOR CRIMES RELATED THEIR DRUG ADDICTION- CERTAINLY WE SEE IN OUR STREETS RIGHT OUT HERE OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL ON K. STREET NOT ALL. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HOMELESS ARE HAVE A DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS ARE THEY COMMITTING CRIMES BUT THERE'S- A STAG GREAT PARALLEL YOU KNOW TRY FACT WITH ALL THESE ISSUES AND YOU KNOW THE VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY TREATMENT SYSTEM ISN'T QUITE WORKING AND I JUST WNT TO ADDRESS THE FALLACY THAT THEY PUT HERE IS THAT THE NOTION THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T GO TO THIS TREATMENT THEY CAN GO TO THEIR COMMUNITY THEY CAN GO AT HOME ON THEIR COUCH AND WITH AN ANKLE BRACELET AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW CAN BE FINE AND DANDY NOW THIS SAYS. WHATEVER THE EXISTING CRIMES ARE CALIFORNIA AND I CAN HELP WORK ON LAWS TO- YOU KNOW REDUCE EFFECTIVE DEFENSES THAT THEY BECOME INCARCERATION BASED IT SAYS WHATEVER THE EXISTS BEFORE YOU'RE SENTENCED AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE A CHOICE YOU CAN GO AND GET- TREATMENT AT THIS FACILITY- OR YOU CAN GO TO- COUNTY JIL OR PRISON AND SO YOU KNOW WE GIVE PEOPLE A CHOICE- THERE ALSO IS AN OPT OUT CLAUSE SOME SOME YOU KNOW WOULD SAY THAT. IF YOU WORK YOU ARE FORCING THEM IN AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPTION TO BACK OUT WELL AFTER THE LAST COMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY WE CLARIFIED THAT ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL ENTERS THIS- SECURED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY IF DAY OR THE PROVIDER I THINK THIS IS NOT A GOOD FIT THEY CAN OPT OUT YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO OPT OUT TO BACK TO PRISON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS. THAT THE QUIRKS DEAN THAT OUR- BASED UPON THEIR CENTER OR NOT- DEEM TO BE- ABLE TO BE RELEASING THE COMMUNITIES THERE'S GONNA SOME TYPE OF AN- CARS. AND THEN YOU KNOW LASTLY THAT- YOU KNOW. COVERS AND FIRST FOUR SCORES AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE IS THE ROCK BOTTOM. SOMETIME THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE INTERVENTION WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER GETS TOGETHER AND pTREATMENT THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S COERCION. WHEN WE HAVE- DIVERSION PROGRAMS WE SAID DRUG COURTS THE COURT MANDATES DOT DRUG TREATMENT- THOSE- YOU KNOW WORK FOR INDIVIDUALS MAY TIMES NOT FOR EVERYBODY BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE. NOTHING WORKING. NOTHING WORKING AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT IT'S A PILOT. IT'S IN ONE COUNTY IF IT WORKS WE CAN REPLICATE ELSEWHERE IF IT DOESN'T WORK. WHAT'S THE HARM YOU KNOW THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SO MANY COMMUTES AROUND CALIFORNIA I THINK THIS IS WORTH THE CHANCE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO- ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU. HI MISTER NAZARIAN AND I'M SORRY MISS WALDRON WAS FOR SITE MY GOD SO. OKAY GOOD- YES YOU- SO THE BILL. JUST QUICKLY FROM HONG THE BILL REQUIRES THAT AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING. IF THE JUDGE MUST OFFER THE DEFENDANT VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN THE PILOT PROGRAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL. OR PRISON SENTENCE THAT THE JUDGE WOULD OTHERWISE IMPOSE IF THERE'S CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET- IT SO THE VOLUNTARY PROCESS HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WITH THE JUDGE WOULD. OFFER THAT DURING THE SENTENCING AND THEN. YEAH IT WOULDN'T BE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS I THINK THIS IS BASED UPON THE EVALUATIONS WITH MEDICAL EXPERTS AND IF WE COULD IF I COULD ALLOW D. A. R.REISIG TO- TAKE TO GO TO DETAIL ABOUT THIS ISSUE. YEAH ARE YOU STILL ONLINE MYSTERY SIX. YES I AM AND THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS TIME OF SENTENCING IF THERE'S SOME INDICATION BY ANY OF THE PARTIES THAT THE SUSPECT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SUFFERS FROM A SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER. THEY CAN BE REFERRED OUT FOR AN ASSESSMENT BY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BY THE EXPERTS AND THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN AS IF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RECOMMENDS TREATMENT THAT THIS PERSON WOULD BENEFIT. THEN THE JUDGE WOULD THEN BE EMPOWERED TO OFFER THE PERSON THE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES. INSTEAD OF PRISON OR JAIL. AND IF THE PERSON CHOSE THE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE. OF THE PROGRAM WHICH WILL CALL HOPE YOU'LL THE WOULD BE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY HELP AND- HELP THE AND HUMAN SERVICES. OKAY AND- I MEAN WE ALL KNOW THE CITIZENS WE'VE HEARD THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN ABOUT- THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LANGUISHING IN OUR PRISONS AND JAILS RIGHT NOW I'M NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED. ONLY TO BE RELEASED AGAIN WE KNOW THAT 95% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON WILL BE RELEASED. MOSTLY WITHOUT TREATMENT WITHOUT- THE NEEDED PROGRAMS. AND THE ONLY TO RESERVOIRS AGAIN SO I MEAN. WE HAVE TO COME TO A POINT WHERE JUST PUTTING PEOPLE IN PRISON OR IN JAIL AND SERVING TIME IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IS WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING THAT CAUSE THEM TO GET INTO THE IN CAR SCHOOL SYSTEM SO I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT CALM AND SEE HOW I THE OFFER WORK IN THIS AREA. AND TO ALL- POINT NOW THAT WE WERE SENT OUR- VOTERS TO MAKE A NAME. AND SO PROBLEMS FOR A DISTRICT. AND WE UNIQUELY.

AND SIMILARLY ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN WITH MATHEMATICA ESTIMATED ECONOMIC COST TO CALIFORNIA TWO POINT FOUR BILLION A YEAR. NATIONAL ECONOMIC CULTURE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BILLION A YEAR. AS YOU HEARD COMPLAINTS OF THE STORY WE HAVE A FRAGMENTED AND COMPLEX MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGES INCLUDING PSYCHIATRISTS. OUR SYSTEM WITH MOTHERS AND FAMILIES SEARCHING FOR CARE AND THERE MUST BROKEN MOMENT. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY FIVE THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT ACT PROVIDES A BETTER WAY. MODELED AFTER THE EVIDENCE BASED MASSACHUSETTS HEALTHCARE ACTIVE PROGRAM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OFFICE. NUMBER WALKING DOWN BEHALF WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION EIGHTY NINE THIRTY FIVE. BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE OF THE AUTHOR HAS TO ENSURE CALL IN RELEASING INSURERS HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CARE. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE REQUIREMENT ON HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS HAVE A PSYCHIATRIST AND A RECOGNITION AVAILABLE TO CONSULT WITH POSITIONS. THAT NOT ONLY CONCERNING WITH RESPECT TO THE POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND I KNOW COST IMPLICATIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS NOTED BY PITTSBURGH ANNOUNCES THAT THE LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT THIS MANDATE WILL RESULT IN BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. AS YOU KNOW WHILE I REMEMBER STRIVE TO INCORPORATE EVIDENCE BASED CARE THANK YOU NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BY LOCATING IT BY HER DECISION. ARE EATING ON HOW DO I SET I THEIR PAY. BY ADDRESSING THIS OF. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY FIVE. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE BACK TO BUY A PLACE HELP PLANS AND INSURERS IN THE BUSINESS AT THE- MEDICAL PRACTICE. FURTHERMORE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT YOU BURKE ANALYSIS AT EIGHTY NINE THIRTY FIVE WHICH POINT TO NASA'S. DONE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. REGARDING EIGHTY SIXTEEN SIX AN ALMOST IDENTICAL BILL WHICH IS HELD IN APPROPRIATE. FOUND THAT THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHIATRIC HE CONSULATES GENERALLY AN INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHIATRIC ECON PUTS THE TYPICALLY FOR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE PART IN PERSON. ONE POINT MAJOR WHEN I TO KNOW. THAT THERE LIMITED EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT PSYCHIATRIC A CONSOLE- ARE ACTIVE AND IMPROVING APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AS MEASURED BY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RECEIPT OF MORE APPROPRIATE CARE. MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER SATISFACTION AND TIMELINESS OF SERVICES. LEAVING US WITH THE QUESTION GIVEN THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WE COLLECTIVELY CONTINUE TO FACE THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMIC TOGETHER. IS THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL MANDATE ON OUR SYSTEMS. AND MORE IN THIS A PROVEN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY THAT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY BRING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO THE PATIENTS WE ARE SEEKING TO PRIORITIZE.

WHICH I TO CLOSE MISTER MAIENSCHEIN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HAIRMAN JUST TO A COUPLE POINTS THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED I DO WANT TO ADDRESS- UNFORTUNATELY WE DO BELIEVE THAT SUBURBAN ANALYSIS. THAT CONFUSE THE TELE PSYCH CONSULT PROGRAM PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WITH HE CONSULTS AND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES THAT HE CONSULTS PROVIDE FOR WRITTEN CONSULTATIONS AND THIS BILL RIGHT- PROPOSES. AN INTERACTIVE CONSULTATION SO. PROVIDER SPECIALIST WITH CONNECT VIA TELEPHONE OR VIDEO AND HAVE A LIVE INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION REGARDING TREATMENT WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE FAR SUPERIOR AND THEN SECONDLY IN TERMS OF COST- I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN HEALTH CARE COST SAVINGS BECAUSE SO MANY MOTHERS HAVE HAD TO FACE MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS WITH MULTIPLE POSITIONS. BECAUSE THEIR SYMPTOMS WEREN'T IDENTIFIED HER PROPER TREATMENT WAS NOT PRESCRIBED IN THIS BILL WILL CUT DOWN ON THOSE UNNECESSARY APPOINTMENTS BY FACILITATING A MORE DIRECT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START WITH I'LL START WITH AB NINETY SEVEN. PLEASE WILL DO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES A. B. NINETY SEVEN WOULD PROHIBIT A HEALTH PLAN BEGINNING. ON JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SECOND. FROM IMPOSING A DEDUCTIBLE ON AN INSULIN PRESCRIPTION. OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM DIABETES. FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS WITH DIABETES INSULIN IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A HEALTHY LIFE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION ADULTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES. IF YOU HAVE DIABETES YOU MOST LIKELY REQUIRE INSULIN TO SURVIVE. HOWEVER BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE PRICE OF INSULIN INCREASED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND UNTENABLE OFTEN CAUSING UNDUE BURDEN ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND FORCING MANY WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR MEDICINE. THE SELF RATION AND LEADER BEING ADMITTED TO EMERGENCY ROOMS UNFORTUNATELY. ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICINE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NEARLY INSULIN REPORTED COST RELATED UNDER USE LEADING TO POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND POTENTIAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT ARE EVEN MORE COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOSE THEIR JOBS THESE STATISTICS ONLY WERE FURTHER EXACERBATED ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO- CHIP BOURBON ALICE'S APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF THREE CALIFORNIANS N. D. M. H. C. PARTNER MEANT- DEPARTMENT OF- MANAGE HEALTH CARE SO- HEALTH CARE. AND D. O. Y. DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATED PLANS USING INSULIN OR 360-007-0050 PEOPLE AGAIN JUST THAT NOT GIVE THE- SPELL OUT THE ACRONYMS. ACCORDING TO A JOB ANALYSIS A PROXY ONE OUT OF THREE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE UNDER THE M. H. C. OR DO I REGULATED PLANS USING INSULIN OR BENEFIT FROM EXEMPTING INSULIN FROM INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES. JOB ALSO FOUND A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT HIGHER COST SHARING REDUCES APPEARANCE TO INSULIN AND LOWER COST SHARING INCREASES ADHERENCE TO INSULIN AND THAT COST SHARING FOR INSULIN IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO INSULIN IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. OPPONENTS OF MY BILL WILL SAY THAT AB NINETY SEVEN WILL RAISE PREMIUMS. BY OVER TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BUT ACCORDING TO CHIPPER AB NINETY SEVEN WOULD INCREASE TOTAL NET ANNUAL EXPENDITURES BY TEN MILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS TOTAL OR ONLY POINT ZERO ZERO EIGHT PERCENT. COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO REPEAT THAT AGAIN EVEN THOUGH IT'S A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IT IS ONLY POINT 0008% THIS IS BY THE INDEPENDENT SUBURBAN HOUSES- TO GO FURTHER ACCORDING TO THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. CALIFORNIANS SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO BILLION ON HEALTHCARE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. TEN MILLION IS LESS THAN ONE HALF OF 1% OF THAT NUMBER. BY LIMITING COST SHARING FOR INSULIN A. B. NINETY SEVEN WILL MAKE INSULIN MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ONE THIRD OF THOSE USING INSULIN ON STATE REGULATED PLANS DECREASE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES BY AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY PERCENT. A DECREASE HOSPITAL VISITS AND INCREASE UNNECESSARY- I'M SORRY DECREASE HOSPITAL VISITS THAT CAN INCREASE UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE TO VIRUSES AND OTHER CONTAGIOUS- AND DECREASE IN MEDICAL HOSPITAL. EMERGENCY HOSPITAL VISITS AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WITHOUT RAISING THE COST PREMIUMS BY MORE THAN. ONE DOLLAR JUST THE ONE LESS THAN A ONE DOLLAR INCREASE. A JOINING ME TODAY IS THE LOWER IS OF A RADO CEO OF COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIP. AND POSSIBLY IN THE KITA HARUS CHAIR OF THE ELLIE CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION I KNOW SHE WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY PAST SIX TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MY NAME IS THE TYPICAL ON HARRIS AND I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I'M AN ACTRESS AND A PRODUCER PHOTOGRAPHER. AND I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES FOUR EIGHT THOUSAND BABIES AND I PREFER NOT A THINKER FORTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TIMES. I CHANGED MY INSULIN PUMP FIVE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR TIMES AND I REQUIRE INSULIN EVERY DAY EVERY MINUTE AN HOUR TO LIVE. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WOULD WITHOUT INSULIN PROJECT FOR HOURS AND NOT FOR OUR PRETTY AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR TWO WEEKS. AND A GROWING HERE NOT BEING ON THE RIGHT KIND OF INSULIN AND FIGHTING THE INSURANCE COMPANY FOR BASIC TOOLS TO MANAGE MY DIABETES. HAS GIVEN YOU COULD COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO DIABETES RAFI LISTENER DAMAGE IN MY LEGS AND FEET AND GASTROPARESIS. WHICH IS NERVE DAMAGE IN MY STOMACH. THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH TYPE ONE AND TYPE TWO DIABETES NEED INSULIN JUST TO LIVE AND THE CASHIER MAKING SURE I HAD ACCESS TO INCLUDES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. PERSONALLY BECAUSE ON MARCH TWENTY TWENTY MY HUSBAND AND I LEARNED THAT WE EXPECTING OUR FIRST BABY. AND ALLOW WOMEN WITH DIABETES CAN. HAVE A HEALTHY PREGNANCY IT DOES TAKE GREAT EFFORT AND ACCESS TO CARE AS WERE HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES. AND I REMEMBER ONE OF THE DOCTORS IN THE DELIVERY ROOM SAYING. ANYTHING HE- COULD HEAR IT EVERY TIME HE THOUGHT TYPE ONE HAVING HEALTHY BABIES BECAUSE EARLY IN HIS CAREER HE WAS ENCOURAGED TO TELL WOMEN LIKE ME NOT TO HAVE BABIES. BECAUSE OF THE LIFE THREATENING POSSIBILITIES OF THE DIABETES CAN CAUSE SEVERE AND LIFE THREATENING COMPLICATIONS IN DELIVERY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND FREQUENCY OF PRETERM DELIVERY. MISCARRIAGE AND EVEN STILL BIRTH- DIABETES INCREASES THE RISK OF THE PROBLEM EVEN WITH GOOD MANAGEMENT. SO I GAVE BIRTH TO MY BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AND I'M BLESSED TO SAY THAT. WE ARE BOTH VERY HEALTHY. BUT I KNOW BUT I TO GET. TO HAVE ACCESS TO INSULIN DAY. FOR THE REST OF MY IN ORDER THAT FOR TO KEEP HAPPENING. AND THAT'S A BIG. HANGING OVER MY HEAD AND I WERE TO BE HERE FOR MY DOG AND HUSBAND. AND THE COST OF INSTALLING. A LIVING WITH. HELPING BIG BABY. HELP HI A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH. PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO AND GETTING PRO. FOR THEIR- OR CUT THEIR DOES IN HALF JUST TO PAY RENT. IN THAT SITUATION AS WELL. IT YOU HAVE TO. DEAL ABOUT THINK ABOUT I'M HERE TO. AND. YOU'RE EXTREMELY HIGH- PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE- TO BUY THEM. R. E. REMOTE- WHERE THEY'RE HEALTHY. ARE AFFORDABLE MORE ACCESSIBLE- ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AND THE THREE MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES IN CALIFORNIA I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT. THIS STEP TOWARD MAKING INSULIN AFFORDABLE. BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH FOR YOU IT'S LIFE AND DEATH FOR US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

IN SANTA CLARA THERE'S A PROPORTIONATE IMPACT DISPROPORTIONATE EXCUSE ME IMPACT OF DIABETES. POPULATIONS I'M VERY KEEN TO THE FACT IT DIABETES RATES FOR LATINO SEPARATE CHINA PART OF THAT COMMUNITY ARE TWICE THE RATE OF NON LATINO WHITES. DIABETES IS ALSO A THREAT TO THOSE IN OUR AGING COMMUNITIES WITH 25% OF THOSE OVER. SIXTY DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. AN UNFORTUNATE DIED SUGGESTING THE MEETING CONCEPT. IN THIS COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SPOKE TO BE UNDER USER INSULIN AND THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN FOR US THE RESULT ARE NOT TAKING THE PHOTOS RESULTING GLYCEMIC- NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR GLYCEMIC. ARE GREAT. POTENTIAL HELP COMPLICATE IMPLICATIONS INCLUDE HEART DISEASE STROKE A STROKE AMPUTATION. AND H. COULD MAKE DECISIONS AND BLANCA THESE COMPLICATIONS OFTEN LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY- YOU KNOW REALLY YOU READ UP SPENDING FOR THE INSULIN PEN YOU CAN'T EXTEND. FOR TREATING THE PATIENT. INSULA RATIONING CALM FOR LOWER INCOME PATIENTS WE FOR THAT OVER AND AGAIN. FOR STATE QUICKER TO SEE TO PURCHASE PURCHASE EITHER THE MEDICATION. OR FOR THEIR FOR. OR THE RENT OR YOU. THE FIFTY TRUE DURING THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF IN YOUR CALENDAR HERE ALL AND YOU PLAN YEAR. OF COURSE THERE ARE BENEFITS TO HEIDI HEALTH INSURANCE SUCH AS LOWER MONTHLY PREMIUMS HOWEVER FOR THOSE IN NEED OF LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS SUCH AS INSULIN. THIS TRADE OFF CAN BE DANGEROUS IF EIGHT DIABETICS FINANCIAL RESOURCE TO TERMINATE IT AND IT TAKES MONTHS TO MEET THAT DEDUCTIBLE REQUIREMENTS IF AT ALL. OKAY ACCEPTING INSULT OF THE QUICKLIME IF THE RIGHT THING DO. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIP ENCOURAGES YOU TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. AND VOTE I ON ASSEMBLY BILL NINETY SEVEN. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STARTING IN I THINK YOU COULD CREATE A COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING I REQUEST. HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SOME. BOTH SUCH ACTUALLY THIS WITNESS IN OPPOSITION EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY. TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR. M. ET. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- AND CUT NICKEL WITH THOSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS- WE ARE OPPOSED TO- MAYBE NINETY SEVEN- MEMBERS INSULIN A LIFESAVING MEDICATION THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS RELY ON DAILY. AND SADLY HOWEVER AND WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS COMMENTS ON THIS ON THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE HIGH PRICE DRUG CRISIS. ON IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THE SKY HIGH PRICES LOGICALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BURDEN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PUT PATIENTS AT RISK. REGRETTABLY EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN DOES NOT HELP THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM INSTEAD THIS BILL AND BILLS LIKE THIS WILL INCREASE PREMIUMS ON INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS IN YOUR DISTRICTS AND THIS WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME IF IT'S AS WE HAVE SEEN REMARKABLY LOW PREMIUM INCREASES ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. NOW GRANTED THE ESTIMATED IMPACT IN PRICING OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS RELATIVELY MODEST BUT WE CANNOT LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL IN A VACUUM. AS THERE ARE SEVERAL MANDATE BILLS. ON THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. SECONDLY BILLS LAKE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN COULD THROW OUR PLAN PRODUCTS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RULES AROUND BENEFIT DESIGN. AND DOES REQUIRE PLANS TO INCREASE THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER SERVICES. GIVEN SECOND OUTCOME COMES TO PASS TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE B. NINETY SEVEN. SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TELL POLICYMAKERS WHICH SERVICES TO SEE AN INCREASE IN OUT OF POCKET COST IF THIS BILL IS IMPLEMENTED AND END UP PUTTING OUR PRODUCTS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACA AND CORRESPONDING STATE RULES- NO THERE'S NO CORRESPONDING AFFECTED OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT WILL LEAD TO ANY REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF INSULIN MANUFACTURERS CURLED. CURTAIL PLANS OR OTHER PURCHASERS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE BILL PASSES THE MANUFACTURES ARE STILL. FREE TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AT WHATEVER LEVEL IN INCREASE THE PRICE ON EXISTING PRODUCTS. IN CONSISTENT PRICE SCIENTIST BY THE DRUG COMPANIES INCLUDING A INSULIN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. IN THESE PRICES CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DRUG- THE DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT ONE ONE INSULIN MANUFACTURER INCREASES THE PRICE FOR A GIVEN INSULIN FORMULATION IN THE OTHER INSULIN MANUFACTURERS OFTEN INCREASE THEIR PRICES BY A SIMILAR AMOUNT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION. ELIMINATING THE DEDUCTIBLE DOES NOTHING TO HELP THE UNDERLYING AND LARGER PROBLEM. ALL IT DOES REQUIRE THE COST BE MEET UP SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BENEFIT DESIGN. IN AGAIN IN THE FORM OF INCREASED PREMIUMS OR PERHAPS- IN THE FORM OF AN INCREASE ACOSTA SHARE FOR OTHER SERVICES. MORE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS IN OUR OPINION OR NEEDED WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE SUPPORTED GREATER TRANSPARENCY LAS IN THIS AREA. ANY EFFORTS LAST YEAR TO BRING MORE GENERIC OPTIONS ON THE INSULIN MARKET TO HELP ADDRESS THE HIGH PRICES CONSUMERS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING FOR THESE DRUGS. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AB NINETY SEVEN- YOU KNOW DOES NOT SOLVE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IN ONE STATE HAVE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD EVENING MR MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TONIGHT IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION AB NINETY SEVEN. WELL THE BILL IS CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED IT DOES CAUSE US SOME CONCERNS WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION THE PRIMARY CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE B. NINETY SEVEN. THE FACT THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WILL MAKE PREMIUMS RISE DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN REMAINING OUT OF POCKET. WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THE SUBURBAN HOUSES. AND GIVEN THE OFFSET THE CALCULATION BUT THEY HAVE IN THEIR IT INDICATED THAT FOR YOUR PREMIUMS COULD RISE THE BIG HALF MILLION DOLLARS JUNCTION OF THE BILL AN EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS A PRIVATE PRODUCT LIKE THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE B. NINETY SEVEN. AGAIN WILL BE INCREASES ALONE ARE TOLERABLE THEY HAVE TO BE TAKEN IN CONTEXT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS BENEFIT MANDATES INTRODUCED THIS YEAR INCLUDING ONE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. PERTAINING TO A POTENTIAL PREMIUM INCREASE OF NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO COLLECTIVELY THESE PREMIUMS- INCREASE. IN RELATION TO THESE MANDATE. AND PRIVATE HEALTHCARE COSTS UPWARDS FOR PLAYERS AND EMPLOYING OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE AVERAGE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM HAS INCREASED. TWENTY TWO PERCENT. SO WILL IT BE. NINETY SEVEN CERTAINLY ADDRESS WITH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- WE'RE HOPING IN AND MAINTAIN THAT WE NEED TO REMAIN CALM. OF THE QUEUE. IN ITS MANDATE HOW A DRIVER HEALTHCARE UP.

HI MISTER CHAIR KATHY DOWN OFTEN- REPRESENTING THE HEALTH TRUSTS WERE PRACTICE BONSER AT EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN AND- DRIVERS. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU WILL GO TO LINE OF FOUR SIXTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. BRENT SPENCER WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN THIS DISTRICT NINE AND THE CALIFORNIA PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OPEN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AGAIN WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION. YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE A COUPLE- PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE IN THIS AREA MISTER NAZARIAN- I KNOW WE'VE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR AND- I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE% YOUR WORK ON THIS. I HAVE TO REFLECT ENOUGH INSULIN WAS INVENTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE FIRST USED IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO NINETY NINE YEARS AGO. THE FACT THAT IT ISN'T AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE TODAY. IS A TRAVESTY IN MY OPINION THE FACT THAT YOUR BILL WOULD CAUSE A POTENTIAL ONE DOLLAR INCREASE IN MONTHLY PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH PLANS IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY I BELIEVE. I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING COSTS- MET OF PHARMACEUTICALS. BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. THROUGH A BILL CALLED THE OFFICE THAT THAT'S GONNA IS TOTALLY ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. FOR EVERYONE WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CAR THE INCREASING COSTS IN HEALTH CARE. SO I DO QUESTION TO. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MANDATES AND THAT AS WE'VE HEARD THAT MESSAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TODAY- WE WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MANDATES- I DO WONDER YOU KNOW THE COST TO THE SYSTEM OF SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THEIR- INSULIN COSTS AND ENDS UP NEEDING MORE EXPENSIVE TREATMENT. I DO HAVE TO WONDER WHAT IF THERE IS IF THERE IS NOT SOME OFFSET THERE. SO SO I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION- WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT- THE MARKET IS WHAT IT IS THEY CHARGE WHAT THEY CAN BECAUSE THEY CAN- AND THERE IS NO PUSH BACK BUT- WE'RE TRYING. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SOLUTION IN THE MEANTIME A SOLUTION LIKE THIS. IS BETTER THAN NO SOLUTION AT ALL. AND I I'M- I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO YOUR BILL IF YOU HAVE ANY. IDEA I'D BE HONORED TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND YET. YOU DO A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH- IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE IF YOU JUST RIGHT NOW I JUST DID A GOOGLE SEARCH JUST SO THAT I CAN SPOT A FEW NUMBERS- MINIMUM NIGHTLY COST ENOUGH HOSPITAL IS TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS GOES UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND I EVEN SAW EIGHTEEN THOUSAND- AND IT DEPENDS ON THE STUDY OF THE YEAR AS WELL THE ONE THAT I LOOKED THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANOTHER ONE WAS A TWO TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY. WE KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE. AND WE KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS. SO IT'S A BASIC SIMPLE MATH FOR ME YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO NEED THIS. A SUBSET OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S NEED THIS HAVE DIABETES AND NEEDED 10% OF IT WILL DIE IF THEY DON'T USE INSULIN. AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEM. THIS DRUG. IN A WAY WHERE IT'S AFFORDABLE. AND IT DOESN'T OVERALL RAISE THE COST TOO MUCH I WOULDBE HAPPY TO PAY A ONE DOLLAR EXTRA MONTH. IF THAT MEANS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THAT FORTY THOUSAND PATIENTS DON'T RATION THE DRUGS. AND DON'T END UP IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE PAYING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NINETY IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. IS GOING TO INCREASE OUR COSTS AND PREMIUMS AND OVERALL HEALTH CARE COSTS MUCH MORE. THAN ONE DOLLAR INCREASE IN SOCIALIZING THE COST OF THE MEDICINE. TRIP TO ME IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL EQUATION THAT MAKES SENSE I KNOW IT DOES TO YOU AS WELL I DO HOPE THAT YOU ALL AGREE WITH THAT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MR ASSYRIAN- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THE MOTION BY MISS CARILLO A SECOND BY MISS BURKE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD I AM MAYES.

PRIMARY ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE SERVICES TO OLDER ADULTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN HEALTH EMERGENCY PACE ORGANIZATIONS. MODIFIED THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY DELIVER CARE TO THEIR PARTICIPANTS IN ORDER TO KEEP. THEIR PARTICIPANTS SAFE. PACE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDED TO COVERT NINETEEN HEALTH EMERGENCY BY IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS INFECTION CONTROL. MEASURES AND QUICKLY TRANSITIONING FROM PROVIDING CENTER FOCUSED CARE.

YES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARRIVED TODAY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT TWENTY TWO. A MEASURE THAT SEEKS TO FILL AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE MEDICAL. OR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO ENSURE COVERAGE FOR EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. UNDER FEDERAL LAW PSYCHIATRIC MERCIES ARE LEGALLY EQUIVALENT TO ALL OTHER MEDICAL EMERGENCIES MANY. THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEMPT TO ASSESS AND STABILIZE. A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT AS IF THEY WOULD ANY OTHER PATIENT WITH A PHYSICAL INJURY. ANY BURDENSOME DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE EXPERTS EXTENSIVE BOARDING TIMES WITH PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS ARE OFTEN SPEND SEVERAL HOURS AND SOMETIMES DAYS WAITING TO TRANSPORT TO INPATIENT. PSYCHIATRIC CARE IN BEDS WITH MY PERSONAL TO PROTECT A TEST OF THE LONG HOURS OF BOARDING TIMES WAITING FOR MERGING BED OPEN UP SO THEY CAN ACCEPT PATIENTS ARRIVING IN AN AMBULANCE. THIS RELY RELY RESULTS IN DELAY OF CRITICAL PATIENT CARE. DELIVERY BOARDING TIMES AND TO BETTER SERVE MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS THERE ARE HOSPITALS THAT HAVE CREATED THERAPEUTIC HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS KNOWN AS PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION UNITS. THESE UNITS ARE PRODUCED BOARDING TIMES IMPROVE CARE FOR MERCY PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS AND MAKE MORE OUTPATIENT EMERGENCY BEDS AVAILABLE FOR ALL PATIENTS. HOWEVER DUE TO LACK OF REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM FOR THE MERCHANT SERVICES LIKE PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION UNITS PROVIDE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE UNITS ARE AT RISK BECAUSE HOSPITALS TAKE ON MOST OF THE COST. AB TWENTY TWO WOULD CONFIRM MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR OBSERVATION SERVICES. THAT ARE PROVIDED A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY SERVICES WITHIN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT INCREASE COORDINATION OF PATIENT CARE BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. AND MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY. THE DOCTOR SCOTT ZELLER WHO SHOULD BE ON THE LINE. THANK YOU MISTER RODRIGUEZ WILL MOVE TO A DOCTOR ZELLER. HELLO HI AND GOOD EVENING- CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DR SCOTT SELLER OF A POSITION WITH. THIRTY FIVE YEARS PRACTICING EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY OF OFFER AUTHORED BOTH FULL EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY TEXTBOOKS AND MY UC PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY ALSO PAST PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY. THANKS SPEAKING HERE TODAY TO URGE THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHT TWENTY TWO WHICH SEEMS TO ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING ISSUE OF PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS BOARDING FOR LONG HOURS IN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. AND DESPITE THE CREATION OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO OF MANY WONDERFUL COMMUNITY OUTPATIENT CRISIS PROGRAMS- OVER THE PAST DECADE. THERE'S JUST SOME PATIENTS WHO ARE JUST TOO ACUTE AN ERROR DANGERS THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO STILL END UP IN HOSPITAL ER'S AND THOSE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO CLIMB AND NOW COMPRISE ONE IN EVERY SEVEN PATIENTS. WERE SEEN IN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZED THAT THE FEDERAL IMPALA LAW DEFINES THE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY AS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION JUST LIKE THAT PERSONALLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK OR BURKE FROM. THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO STABILIZE THESE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR ADMITTED IMPATIENT. THE BOARDING CRISIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE EMERGENCY ROOMS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN COMPENSATED FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE. SO THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE THE OPTION OF HOLDING PATIENTS TO ADMIT THEM OR TRANSFER THEM TO THE INPATIENT BEDS. WHICH OFTEN ENDS UP BEING LONG HOURS OR EVEN DAYS. SO IMAGINE IF YOU WENT TO AN E. R. WITH AN ASTHMA ATTACK. AND YOU WERE JUST STRUGGLING TO BREATHE AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS WALK YOU TO THE BACK OF THE YARDS AT SIT TIGHT FOR A FEW HOURS WHILE WE TRY TO FIND YOU AN ASTHMA HOSPITAL. WHERE MEDICARE WILL REIMBURSE FOR YOUR CARE THAT SOUNDS PRETTY RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WITH PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES. WHICH CAN BE REALLY DEBILITATING OR OR ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE SUICIDALITY OR OR HEARING AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS TELLING THEM TO HURT OTHERS. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS IF WE ACTUALLY START TREATMENT AT THE EMERGENCY LEVEL OF CARE. WE'RE GOING JUST LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BE THE EMERGENCY LEVEL OF CARE TREATMENT FOR AN ASTHMA ATTACK WE ACTUALLY HAVE REALLY GREAT OUTCOMES. IN WHAT WE CAN DO IS SOMETHING THAT'S KNOWN AS PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION CARE. IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS AND WE KNOW THAT IF WE DO THIS WE CAN STABILIZE UP 280% OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WE CAN PROBABLY HELP THESE FOLKS FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST OF WHAT IN PATIENT CARE AREAS. AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO SAVE THOSE PRECIOUS INPATIENT BEDS FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO TRULY HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. SO PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION UNITS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS EMPAT UNITS IN IMPACT IS AN ACRONYM THAT STANDS FOR EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY ASSESSMENT TREATMENT AND HEALING UNITS. THAT'S MOVING PATIENTS QUICKLY OUT OF THE E. R. TO A MORE HOME LIKE THERAPEUTIC. CALMING ENVIRONMENT WITH RAPID ACCESS TO A PSYCHIATRIC PROVIDER AND PROMPT INITIATION OF TREATMENT PLANT. AND THIS IS ALL VERY COLLABORATIVE AND NON COERCIVE THERE'S CLOSE TO ZERO USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED TO THE REGULAR ER. AND THERE'S VERY VERY HIGH PATIENT SATISFACTION. AND WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AS WE CAN EVEN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED- THE CARE IN JUST GENERAL ER'S WHO DON'T HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION UNIT. BY IMPLEMENTING REIMBURSEMENT. FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION CARE AND THE RESULTS OF ARE VERY AS- IN PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATIONS ALREADY COVERED BY MEDICARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE AND MANY OTHER STATES MEDICAID. BUT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR MEDIC CAL WHICH IS WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COVERAGES FOR THE PATIENTS. SEEN WITH PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES BOTH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND MANAGED MEDICARE PLANS. BOTH SEEM TO FEEL THAT THE OTHER- AND HE SHOULD UNDERSELL THINKABLE FOR. YEAH DR ZELLER OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY VERY NFORMATIVE I THINK WE'LL KEEP YOU ON THE LINE FOR ANY QUESTIONS BUT I THINK YOUR TIME IS- IS. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE- I THINK WE'VE GOT THERE'S NO MORE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE MR RODRIGUEZ WE'RE GONNA MOVE- TO THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION AND I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A MICHELLE CABRERA. MRS CABRERA MAY KNOW YOUR LINE IS OPEN. APOLOGY CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. WE'VE GOT. TO OKAY PERFECT A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MACHEL CABINET OUT WITH EDTA THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HE B. H. D. A. AS OPPOSED TO EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES WERE AWAITING TRANSFER FOR IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ARE IN FACT RECEIVING A MINIMUM DEFINED SET OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS DOCTORS SELLER DESCRIBED IN HIS TESTIMONY. WHILE HOSPITALS DO HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO STABILIZE TREAT TO THEIR CAPACITY AND TRANSFER ALL PATIENTS WHETHER THE EMERGENCY IS A PHYSICAL HEALTH EMERGENCY OR A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ALL TOO OFTEN INDIVIDUAL PURPORTED IN P. D. BECAUSE HOSPITALS HAVE NOT INVESTED IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING. ON CALL PSYCHIATRIST. KERN BOB SERVICE ARE IS HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED IN EDIE'S AND ARE NOT REIMBURSED BE A MEDIC CAL. IN ADDITION COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN CAN AND DO REIMBURSED FOR A VARIETY OF HOSPITAL BASE SITE PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES INCLUDING CRISIS STABILIZATION AND PSYCHIATRY CONSUL. AND OTHERS THAT ARE WITH IN OUR SPECIALTY MEDIC HOW HOPE OF BENEFITS. IF THIS BILL SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A NEW MEDIC HOW BENEFIT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC ORIENTED OBSERVATION SERVICES IN HE BEANS WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO REFLECT. HOW THE SERVICES ARE NEW AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO BILL FOR TWO DAYS AND CLARIFY A MINIMUM REQUIRED SET OF STANDARDS PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. CURRENTLY THE BILL REFERENCES A NON PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION CODE IN THIS IS THAT PHYSICAL HEALTH OBSERVATION CODES AND SO IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR SPECIALTY. MENTAL HEALTH PLAN- IF THE AUTHOR IS INTENDING TO REIMBURSE HOSPITALS FOR EMERGENCY OR POLITICALLY STATION SERVICES THAT DID NOT BY DEFINITION INCLUDES PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES THAN THOSE WOULD BE BETH EL BILL TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN THIS BILL.

TWELVE FOURTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU THE DOCTOR WOULD AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THE POINTS MADE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THEIR PRIME ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. AB TWELVE FOURTEEN DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO SEEK WAIVER APPROVAL FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES CMS. TO ALLOW JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL COVERAGE DURING THE THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE FROM A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. NATIONAL DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION CONTAINED TO THIS PUT DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PERSONS UP 280% THE HAVE BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES WHILE ABOUT HALF STRUGGLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY TWELVE. HALF OF PEOPLE IN STATE FEDERAL PRISON THE LOCAL SHERIFF. HAVING A CHRONIC CONDITION. DUE TO LONGER SENTENCES IN PRISONS. JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE DIABETES HEART AND OTHER CONDITIONS ON THE AVERAGE POPULATION BY TWENTY THIRTY PEOPLE AGE FIFTY AND OLDER IS PROJECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR ONE THIRD OF ALL INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE AND THREE TO EIGHT TIMES INCREASED RISK OF OVERDOSE DEATHS WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. THIS CAN BE PREVENTED WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE AND TREATMENT AFTER REENTRY. CURRENTLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE TO SIGN UP FOR MEDICARE L. AS PART OF THE JUST DISCHARGE A RELEASE PLAN. BUT THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE- UNTIL RELEASE THIS GAP CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BOOK APPOINTMENTS ACCESS PROVIDE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT THIS POPULATION DESPERATELY NEEDS BY PROVIDING PRISONERS WITH ACTUAL MEDICAL COVERAGE WHEN THEY'RE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF RELEASE. THE STATE CAN INSURE THE PEOPLE DO NOT EXPERIENCE ANY GAP IN COVERAGE. AFTER THEY LEAVE PRISON AND TREATMENT STOPS. AB TWELVE FOURTEEN WILL PROVIDE UNINTERRUPTED HEALTH COVERAGE TO ENSURE THE HIGH RISK HIGH NEED JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS WILL RECEIVE MUCH NEEDED CARE AS THEY TRANSITION BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. JOINING ME TODAY ON THE PHONE IS DR KEITH HUMPHREYS A PROFESSOR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED ON THE WHITE HOUSE COMMISSION ON DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES NATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL OF THE US SUBSTANCE ABUSE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I HANDED OVER TO DR HUMPHRIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR OUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT WHEN YOU'RE READY DR HUMPHRIES. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU DOCTOR THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES SIR. OKAY FANTASTIC. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN WOULD THANK YOU TO HOLD COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE MINORITY LEADER HAS HAS RAISED AS MENTIONED I'M A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD I STUDY DICTION FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS I'VE ALSO BEEN AN INSPECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. TO UNDERSTAND THE- WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IF YOU CAN YOU CAN RELATE IF YOU'VE EVER HAD YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH BECAUSE YOU CHOSE A DIFFERENT PLAN OR YOUR EMPLOYER GET AND THEN YOU FOUND THAT. YOUR CARE WAS DISRUPTED IN SOME WAY SOMETHING THAT APPOINTMENT AND I GOT CANCELED SOME PAPERWORK WENT AWRY. ON YOUR CUT YOUR CARE WAS CHANGED- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM BECAUSE MEDICAID SHOT STOPPER DOUBLES WHEN THEY GO IN A CORRECTIONAL. FACILITY AND FOR THEM IT'S NOT AN ANNOYANCE. IT SO OFTEN A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH. YEAH THERE'S A VERY STUDY IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE THAT SHOWS IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS BACK RELEASED. THE RISK OF DEATH OF A FORMER INMATE IS ABOUT THIRTEEN TIMES THAT. OF THE GENERAL POPULATION- BIPARTISAN LEGISLATORS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT AND BAKER GETTING STATES TO- AND MEDICAID TO EXPERIMENT WITH WITH EXTENDING COVERAGE INTO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND I APPLIED. ASSEMBLY WILL AND WALDRON FOR WANTING CALIFORNIA TO BE ONE OF THOSE STATES. THE BIGGEST BENEFACTORS OF THIS R. R. ANYONE WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS WILL BENEFIT BUT THE BIGGEST ONES ARE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ADDICTIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH WHO ARE PROBABLY YOU KNOW. 758085% OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. I DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THAT APPALLING DEATH RATE AFTER PRISON THE BIGGEST COUNTRY CONTRIBUTOR IS DRUG OVERDOSE AND NOT FAR BEHIND THAT. IS SUICIDE SO AND WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE SERVICES WHEN THEY LEAVE. AND THEY'RE NOT IN THERE THEY'VE NOT HEARD CONTINUITY IS JUST EXTRAORDINARILY VULNERABLE TIME FOR THEM AND THEY AND THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THAT THE TIME FOR THAT TO BE PREPARED FOR PRISONS TO GET. STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PROVIDERS THEY CAN PROVIDE THAT CONTINUITY I WOULD SAY ALSO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE PRISONERS IT'S ALSO TRUE EVERY STUDY WE'VE DONE SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO LEAD CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AND GO BACK TO SUBSTANCE USE OR HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES WHICH AFFECTS THE REST OF THE PUBLIC. AND THEN THE MORE LIKELY AND BACK UP IN PRISON WHICH WE ALL. WE ALL PAID FOR SO THERE'S ALSO A PUBLIC. SAFETY BENEFIT HERE. I WOULD JUST AND BY GIVING YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND TEAM OF US FROM OUR STANFORD GROUP VISITED RHODE ISLAND. WHICH WENT AHEAD AND DID THIS ON THEIR OWN THE USING STATE DOLLARS ENTIRELY IN JUST FOR ONE POPULATION. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS WHEN THEY CAME INTO PRESENT. DAY PAID FOR ALL THEIR CARE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GOT MEDICATED ASSISTED MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. BROUGH THE PRESENT AND THE SAME PROVIDER WAS PAID- INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY DROPPED THE RATE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM THEIR PRISONERS BY SIXTY PERCENT. AND SO MANY OF THEIR OVERDOSES IN THAT STATE FOR FROM PRESENT THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE RATE DROPPED TRANSFORMATIVE. ON PROBE FOR VERY LONG POPULACE AND I URGE YOU. TO SEE. IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU WELL- WHAT'S WAITING WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO HELP ME HERE SO IT'S COMING A GOOD PARENT SAYS. PROBABLY RULES AGAINST SHARING YOUR OWN BILL SO. I WON'T DO THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- BEFORE I TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BILL DOES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIC CAL OR CAL AIM AS IT'S KNOWN. CALLIE IS FAR REACHING AND IS A FAR REACHING AND AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND REPRESENTS COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK OVER SEVERAL YEARS TO IMPROVE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW WE HAD THREE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON CALENDAR EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT CALLIN. FOR LOTS OF REASONS WE THINK WE SHOULD BE HEARING THESE PROPOSALS THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS A DOCTOR PAN AND I DIVIDE UP THE MULTIPLE CALLIN PROVISIONS IN FIVE DIFFERENT BILLS AND USE THE ADMINISTRATION'S LANGUAGE AS A STARTING POINT. WHEN ISSUES ARE VETTED AND ADDRESSED IN THE LANGUAGE IS WORKED OUT THE LANGUAGE MAY GO BACK INTO THE TRAILER BILL- THIS BILL- IS THE FIRST OF THE THREE KALYAN BILLS WE'RE HEARING TODAY WILL CONTINUE A PROGRAM CREATED IN THE PREVIOUS MEDICARE WAIVER PROGRAM CALLED THE GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT REPURPOSES WHAT ARE KNOWN AS FEDERAL DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE FUNDS. TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THE REMAINING UNINSURED IN LOWER COST SETTINGS AND DON'T WORRY THIS GETS MORE COMPLICATED. SECOND THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXTEND THE HOSPITAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PUBLIC HOSPITALS. TO INCLUDE DISTRICT HOSPITALS HE'S PAYMENTS ARE TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF EXPIRING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE LAST WAIVER THAT ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO HELP INMATES LEAVING THOSE FACILITIES APPLY TO MEDICARE. WILL COVER CALIFORNIA SO THAT THEY CAN BE ENROLLED IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE UPON RELEASE. AND LAST THIS BILL WOULD RESTART DISCUSSIONS AROUND COUNTY ELIGIBILITY DETERMINE PROPER TERMINATION PROCESS FOR MEDICARE. AND HOW TO IMPROVE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE. WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER WAYS OF REACHING PEOPLE WHO MAY MOVE A LOT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WORKING GROUP WILL LOOK AT. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SARAH HESKETH OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND CHARRETTE ELENA THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM. THANK DOCTOR WOULD ALL GO- TO FIRST TEST MONEY SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING THE ERICA MARIE I'M ACTUALLY THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS WE REPRESENTED TWENTY ONE COUNTY OWNED OR AFFILIATED IN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HELP AT THE PROPERTY. AS YOU ALL KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SERVE AS POTENTIAL THINKING THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS MOST PATIENTS SEEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARRIVE AUTOMATIC CAL REMAIN UNINSURED MANY SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND MANY EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS. AND OTHER CHALLENGING SITUATIONS. OVER THE YEARS PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE DEVELOPED DEEP EXPERTISE IN TREATING PATIENTS IN BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OFTEN BY MEETING CHALLENGING PERFORMANCE MILESTONES SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF THE WAY FIRST PRIME PROGRAM AN ACRONYM THAT STANDS FOR PUBLIC HOSPITAL REDESIGN AND EFFECTIVE BEEN MEDIC COW BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS ACHIEVE BLOOD PRESSURE. KEEPING BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL AND AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS WERE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION AMONG A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. I HAVE CURRENT WAIVER EXPIRES EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE OF WOULD HELP PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TWO IMPORTANT THINGS. FIRST ROLE CRIME INTO A DIFFERENT AND MORE CHALLENGING PROGRAM AS A CHAIRMAN WOULD. DESCRIBE THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS OR Q. I. P. IN SO DOING PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WOULD MOVE THE NEEDLE EVEN FURTHER IN AREAS SUCH AS DIABETES CARE AND BEHAVIORAL MATERNAL AND PERINATAL CARE. SECOND EXTEND AN EXISTING WAIVER PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINING AND SHORT AT THE CHAIRMAN WOULD SAID THE GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS AND MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING BY OFFERING PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN MORE FUNDING IF THEY PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC SERVICES TO THE REMAINING UNINSURED. WHICH AS WE'VE ALL SEEN WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM REDUCES EMERGENCY BRING YOU THROUGH BETTER COORDINATION BY NEEDING. A BROADER SET OF PATIENTS ME. THESE PRODUCTS. I THINK PROGRAMS EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO HELP BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF SERVICES AND WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ACTUALLY RECEIVED FOR THESE REASONS AND THE TREMENDOUS THANK THE CHAIRMAN WHAT AND HIS STAFF WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR MURRAY WILL MOVE TO- STRADDLING. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SURELY THE LANE WITH THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE STATE THIRTY THREE DISTRICT AND MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT ALL ASPECTS. OF EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK PRIMARILY ABOUT THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM BUT MISS MURRAY- MENTION. THE THIRTY THREE DISTRICT MUNICIPAL PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE A DIVERSE GROUP TWO THIRDS- IN WAL CALIFORNIA AND MORE THAN HALF HAVE A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL DESIGNATION. MEANING THEY'RE THE MOST REMOTE AND SMALL OF A POSSIBLE. OTHER DISTRICT ARE LARGE AND THEY'RE LOCATED IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS. ALL PROVIDE NEEDED HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SERVICES BASED ON THEIR COMMUNITIES NEED. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THESE HOSPITALS SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATED AND THE PRIME PROGRAM THAT MEMORY JUST MENTION AND ARE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE WORK- ARE THE TYPE OF WORK AND BUILD UPON IT. IN THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT- I PURCHASED A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PAYMENT PROGRAM DO YOU THINK WE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND IMPROVING CARE TO PAY- CARE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY. THE INCENTIVE FUNDING TIED TO SIX- IS TIED TO SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES ON METRICS. AND IT WILL ALLOW THE DISTRICT HOSPITALS TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON THE GOLDEN PRIORITIES ONLY. WHICH IN TURN ONLY BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES AND THE PATIENT SIR- WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND- TIME HOSPITALS WHAT SERVICES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE WILL NOT. NOT THERE PREVIOUSLY THESE INCLUDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ONCOLOGY AT CETERA OTHER SMALL HOSPITALS CAN POINT TO A VERY SPECIFIC LIFE STAGE BECAUSE OF IMPROVED CANCER SCREENING. AND OTHER- CAN POINT TO. THE WORK THEY DID IN CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT WHICH ONLY BENEFITED THE CURE- OF THE HEALTH OF THE PATIENTS WHICH RESULTED IN YOU KNOW FEWER EMERGENCY. DEPARTMENT VISITS ETCETERA. ALL I ALL OF THE DISTRICT MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL TO BE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE DIRECT RESULTS OF CRIME AND THESE WILL BE EXPANDED AS PART OF Q. I. P. WE- WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SO THAT THE PROPOSED Q. I. P. FOR DISTRICT HOSPITAL AND FIELD AND OTHER WHITE PROJECTED TO CONSIDER THE UNIQUENESS OF JUST BURKE AND THE DIFFERENCES FROM OUR COUNTY AND UC CALLING. M. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE COBEN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THESE HOSPITALS AND TEMPORARILY DIVERTED QUALITY EFFORTS BUT ALL EAGER TO GET UP TO WHITE P. EFFORTS INCLUDING BETTER PLANNING DATA MINING ETCETERA. BACK ON TRACK AS NOTED WE- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE AND ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR- FOR HIS EFFORTS ALONG WITH A LONG DECLINE THANK YOU THANK YOU MRS LANE AND WE'LL SEE IF THEY'RE I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANYBODY ANY TESTIMONY.

WALDRON WALDRON AYE CALDERON CALDERON AYE. THIRTEEN ZERO THIRTY WOULD IT IS THIRTEEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT BELIEVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS- MOVING ONTO YOUR NEXT ITEM- WHICH IS- EIGHTY NINE FORTY TWO I BELIEVE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. THIS IS THE SECOND CAL AIM A BILL AND IT DEALS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHANGES IT CONTAINS SEVERAL PROFIT PROVISIONS BUT OUR FOCUS ON THE THREE BIGGEST CHANGES. FIRST THIS BILL CHANGES HOW COUNTIES CLAIM FEDERAL MEDICAID MATCHING FUNDS COUNTIES USE REALIGNMENT FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS ON THE BASIS OF WHAT ARE CALLED CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES OR CPD'S. CITY EASE OUR COST BASE METHOD OF CLAIMING FEDERAL FUNDS AND THIS METHOD OF CLIENT CLAIMING CREATES A LOT OF WORK ON THE WORKLOAD FOR COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS TO DOCUMENT COSTS. THEY ALSO CREATE FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE YEARS FOR THE COST RECONCILIATION PROCESS TO BE MADE FINAL AND IT RESULTS IN AUDIT RISKS FOR COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS AND THE THREAT OF HAVING TO PAY BACK FUNDS. THIS BILL WOULD INSTEAD SHIFT OUT COUNTIES CLAIM WHAT ARE CALLED INTER GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS- I. G. T.'S. THIS SHIFT IN HOW FUNDS ARE CLAIM OF FREE CUNTIES AND PROVIDERS FROM TREATING THE CHART. AND WILL FREE UP TIME SO THAT PROVIDERS CAN TREAT. PATIENTS IT WILL ALSO ENABLE COUNTIES TO PAY FOR PROVIDERS DIFFERENTLY INCLUDING BUT ABOVE COSTS. SECONDLY THIS BILL WILL IT WOULD LIFT THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE IN STATE REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT WHEN TREATMENT AND CARE CAN BE PROVIDED BY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER EXISTING REGULATIONS A PROVIDER CAN'T BE REIMBURSED NOW. UNTIL THE PATIENT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH PROVIDERS REPORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL SEVEN SESSIONS WITH A PATIENT. THIRD THE BILL WOULD CODIFY THE PROPOSED BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP COUNTIES PREPARE FOR THE MULTIPLE CHANGES THAT ARE PART OF CALTRAIN. TESTIFYING TODAY ON THE BILL CAMILLE SCHRADER WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OF REDWOOD COMMUNITY SERVICES.

CHILDREN IN A HEALTH NEEDS EARLIER HE BEFORE THERE MAY BE A TECHNIQUE THAT. AND IN RECOGNITION OF THE THAT TO IS A- THAT ALLOW. TO BE ABLE TO HELP IN. CURRENT DIAGNOSIS REQUIRED CAN PREVENT THOSE WE SERVE PROJECTS MANY NECESSARY SERVICES THEY NEED. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CHILDREN IN YEARS DURING HIGH TO THINK THAT SERVICES. BUT IT IS ALSO A- IMPORTANCE FOR OUR TO AND OLDER ADULTS MEDIC OUT. THIS IS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT AS THE INDIVIDUAL CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO SYSTEMS AND WE NEVER WANT TO BE DELAYED OR DENIED SERVICES THEY CAN QUITE LITERALLY SAVE LIVES. THESE KINDS OF DISPUTES HAPPEN OFTEN FOR OUR OUR ADULT AND OLDER ADULT BENEFICIARY WHO DEFINITELY NEEDS THE MENTAL HEALTH OR IF YOU D. G. SERVICES. ALL CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE CALLIN. ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSING CALLIN SHOULD BE CODIFIED IN STATE LAW AND NOT ONLY THROUGH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. OF THE SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN OR THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVERS. THIS IS NECESSARY TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE THEIR ONGOING STATE MEDIKAL OBLIGATION. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY FOR THOSE REQUIREMENTS BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE WAIVER THAN. ON A FINAL NOTE AS THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO ADDRESS.

SNAP. DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN THE PERSON IS ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICARE WOULD RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS THROUGH ONE PLAN THAT OFFERS BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL BENEFITS BUT IN SEPARATE PRODUCTS THE IDEA OF A LINE TO RUN ENROLLMENT IS CAE WOULD BE BETTER INTEGRATED AND COORDINATED IF YOU HAVE ONE PLAN COORDINATING THE ENTIRETY OF THE PERSON'S MEDICARE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. SECOND THE BILL WITH A LINE BENEFITS ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT MEDICARE MANAGED DELIVERY MODELS RIGHT NOW SOME BENEFITS ARE CARVED INTO THE PLAN IN SOME COUNTIES BUT NOT IN OTHERS THIS CREATES WORK FOR THE STATE IN SETTING RATES AND MAKING THE PROGRAM MORE COMPLICATED WHEN PEOPLE MOVE IN SWITCH COUNTIES THE BIGGEST CHANGE HERE IS INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE SUCH AS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IN THE AREA I REPRESENT THESE BENEFITS ARE CARVED IN BUT IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE THEY ARE NOT THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES THAT REQUIRE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS IN THIS BILL INCLUDING THE DETAILS ON HOW ALIGNMENT WILL WORK RATES PAID THE LONG TERM CARE PROVIDERS HOW THE TRANSITIONAL WORK CONTINUITY OF CARE AND WHAT ALIGNMENT MEANS AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL.
