MEMBER MEMBERS TRICKLING IN. AS WE DO THAT WE CAN GET THIS -- COMMITTEE STARTED WERE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. ON ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS -- THIS IS OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. FORMERLY IT'S WAS RECENTLY RENAMED AS FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES -- FOR THOSE THAT WERE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THAT ORGANIZATION TO SAME ONCE WITH A DIFFERENT NAME -- WE WILL BEGIN TODAY WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM MICHAEL PICKER. AN ALLIS STUBBINS -- TODAY REPRESENTING THEM BOB. CAN REGISTER SOME OVERSIGHT COMMENT I MEAN JUST SOME A PRELIMINARY COMMENTS LIKE MAKE FEW. OF REGARDING THIS PAST YEAR. ANOTHER EXTREMELY ACTIVE YEAR -- ESPECIALLY ON THE ISSUE RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES -- NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH THE CAMPFIRE IN PARADISE -- JUST. COMPLETELY OBLITERATED THE TOWN AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENCES THIS IS PROBABLY -- THE THE THE ISSUE THAT HAS. OF ALL THE FIRES AND ALL OF A MORE DEVASTATING ALL OF THEM BECAUSE NOT ONLY DEATH AND DESTRUCTION BUT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR. THAT THE YOU KNOW IGNITED -- BY -- UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE HAS AS HAS A BEEN BEEN A ISSUE THAT HAS -- REALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR HIS RETURN THE LEGISLATURE TO TO THIS THIS ISSUE. AND HAS CAUSED A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS AND THAT HAS LED TO THESE DOWNGRADE TO THE UTILITIES NOW POSING A PROBLEM. FOR OUR STATE OUR RATE PAYERS AND JUST THE WHOLE. THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY -- BRING IN THIS DEBATE FORWARD -- IT'S IT'S A AT TIMES CAN REQUIRE. I AM AND MY OPINION LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND FOUR WERE GOING THROUGH THAT BUT I ALSO ON A HERE FROM THE P. YOU SEE IN TERMS OF THE PERSPECTIVES ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE CONVENED A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND ADOPTED SB NINE A ONE THAT REQUIRED A NUMBER OF ACTIONS BY THE CPUC UTILITIES TO REDUCE. ARE THE WILD FIRE RISK IN A JUST HOW COST RECOVER. CURRY IN DAMAGES ARE HANDLED AND OF COURSE THAT IS ALSO. AT THE ADDITIONAL PROCESS. AS I MENTIONED P. GINNY FIRED FOR TO FILE FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN REORGANIZATION BANKRUPTCY. WHAT TO ADDRESS THESE -- CLAIMS. A SEVEN FROM -- FIRES IGNITED BY THEIR EQUIPMENT INCLUDING THOSE THAT MAY RESULT IN THE CAMP FIRE. JUST LAST WEEK OR COMMITTEE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY CASE -- JUST -- TO GET THE PUBLIC AND MEMBERS AT A MORE FAMILIAR WITH -- THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND WHAT IT ENTAILS AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR UTILITIES. ALL OF THE THIS COMING IN ON ON THE HEELS OF YEARS OF REFORM EFFORTS OF THE OF THE P. UC CPUC AS WELL AS OF THE CONTINUED ISSUES STEMMING FROM THE MAJOR LEGALLY SO CANYON. I AND DECISIONS AND ACTIONS TO THE COMMISSION TO NUCLEAR PLANTS IN THE STATE AND OF COURSE THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THE BRUNO POP HI PLAN EXPLOSION. CPUC IS AN AGENCY THAT IS ALSO HAVING TO ADJUST TO THE TO THE CHANGE IN ENERGY LANDSCAPE. AND IT CONTINUES ITS OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION OF TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE. WHICH IS ALSO. WHAT'S ALSO SEEN NUMEROUS OF LEGISLATIVE. AMENDMENTS TO THAT [inaudible] REGULATORY PROCESS. AND ALSO -- RATE REGULATE WATER UTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION FOR HIRE. ARE ALL ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE PC THAT WHERE THEY CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE -- PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND AND QUIRK AND REFORMS AND CHANGES TO HOW. THE PC OPERATES. TODAY WE WILL HEAR -- THE ANNUAL REPORT -- FROM THE CPUC WHICH HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW AND EVERY YEAR KEEPS GETTING A LITTLE BIT FATTER. SO THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS ALL THE WORK THE CPUC HAS DONE. IN RESPONSE TO NOT ONLY THESE -- CHECK A CREASE CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT ALSO TO NEW LEGISLATION. THAT IS NOT ONLY PROVIDED PC WITH NEW DIRECTION AND NEW REGULATORY -- RULES -- BUT ALSO -- REQUIRE IN OF THE PC A TWO OUR TAKE ON NEW NEW CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO DO BEFORE -- TODAY WE WILL ALSO HEAR OF THE ANNUAL REPORT. INCLUDED IN THE C. P. UC'S REPORTERS HOT HOT. AS TO HOW TO DRESS IN SAFETY. AFFORDABILITY AND RELIABILITY. AS WELL AS THE STATUS OF IMPLANT AND PLANTING THE MANY BILLS OVER THE YEARS. RELATED TO REFORM IN THE AGENCY IMPROVING SAFETY IMPLEMENTED CLEAN AND CLEAN ENERGY POLICY EXPANDING BROADBAND SERVICE AND MANY OTHERS. THAT'S OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THE NUMEROUS PERSONNEL CHANGES THE AGENCY HAS ALREADY. UNDERGONE INCLUDING A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THE ROOT RECENT APPOINTMENT OF A NW COMMISSIONER HIGHER IN NEARLY A QUARTER. OF ITS STAFF NEW STAFF THERE ON BOARD TO DIRECT THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES. AND SEVERAL OTHER MANAGEMENT CHANGES WITHIN THE AGENCY. SO -- WELL NOT FOR THEIR DO I LIKE. TO WELCOME THE CQC WITNESSES TODAY. CLOTHING -- MICHAEL PICKER. THE PRESIDENT THE CPU CIALIS DEVON SIX SECOND OF DIRECTOR -- FROM OF THE CPUC AND AFTER WE HEAR FROM SI PC WILL HEAR FROM THE AND ANY ENTITY FORMALLY NOTICES AS KNOWN AS THE OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. HI MICHAEL BAKER AND JOIN BUYER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALICE STEBBINS LEE PALMER FROM OUR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION STEPPING IN -- FOR FOR LISA BETTER MALASHENKO WHOSE WAY ON FAMILY BUSINESS AND EDWARD RANDOLPH WHO IS OUR ENERGY DIVISION DIRECTOR. SO I FEEL LIKE I I'M REALLY OBLIGATED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT FROM OUR ANNUAL REPORT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY A STATUTE OF DIRECTED US TO PROVIDE TO YOU SO I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE LOTS OF TIME FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. LAKE THAT'S ALWAYS MORE INSTRUCTIVE FOR FOR LEGISLATORS. SO. PIECE OF GOOD NEWS -- AN UPDATE ON CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. SUPPLIED 33% OF ITS CUSTOMERS WITH FILE ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY EXPECT TO BE AT ABOUT 56% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM THOSE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES. A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS A 28% BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY EXPECT TO BE AT 40%. SENIOR GAS ELECTRIC IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS AT 43% AND AND TWENTY TWENTY EXPECTS TO BE A FORTY FIVE POINT 2%. THIS IS ALL FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE EARLIER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION THAT THEY WOULD BE AT TWENTY TWENTY THE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO CONTRACT THE PRICES FELL NINE POINT FOR PER YEAR BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AVERAGE PRICE ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO IN CALIFORNIA WAS FOUR POINT SEVEN CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR. SOME UNVERIFIED REPORTS THERE WE'VE HEARD IN THE SOUTHWEST OF TO CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR DESERT SOLAR IN FOR SENT -- ON A PER KILOWATT HOUR SOLAR PLUS BATTERY KEEP GETTING REPEATED SO THIS THE LEGISLATURE THE CITY CALIFORNIA STRATEGY. OF FORCING THE PROCUREMENT OF OUR ENERGY OUR ELECTRICAL ENERGY FROM THESE CLEAN SOURCES. HAS PROVEN TO BE A GOOD BATH BOTH IN TERMS OF SUCCESS IN ACTUALLY BUILDING THE PROJECTS AND AND CONNECTING THEM AND PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH RELIABLE ELECTRICITY. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF BRINGING THE PRICE DOWN BY CREATING A LARGER MARKET AND MORE COMPETITION -- SO THAT'S IN OR IN OUR OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANNUAL REPORT ON THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. I'LL JUST MENTION A FEW OTHER THINGS -- MAJOR FOCUS INTERNALLY WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHO HAS UNDERTAKEN A WHOLE SERIES OF INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING. WE HAVE MUCH STRONGER BUSINESS SYSTEMS ALREADY AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS -- WERE BEGINNING TO WORK WITH CAL LIKE TEA AND OUR NEW I. T. DIRECTOR TO MOVE INTO THE TO THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY SOME DAY WE HOPE TO CATCH UP TO TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY. WE HAVE NEW INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS WE HAD A RETIREMENT AND WE ACTUALLY REPLACED ONE WE WANT TO GET STRONGER IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DO THAT BUT WE'RE TRACKING BETTER CANDIDATES NOW THAN WE DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO% WHEN WE ACTUALLY FIRST MADE THE EFFORT TO BUILD. UP THOSE PROGRAMS. PROGRESS IN RESOLVING OUR PROCEEDINGS WITHIN TIME LINES. SO TWO HUNDRED NINE PROCEEDINGS LAST YEAR WERE RESOLVED IN A TIMELY FASHION. THIRTY THREE WERE RESOLVED WITH EXTENSION ANYWHERE FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS MOST OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY TO ACCOMMODATE SETTLING PARTIES. AS PEOPLE GOT CLOSE TO THE DEADLINES THEY ACTUALLY STARTED TO MEET TO DEVELOP SETTLEMENTS. SO THEN WE HAVE TO REVIEW THE SETTLEMENTS TO WITH CALIFORNIA LAW AND THAT DURING THE RATE PAYERS INTEREST. SO NATURALLY TENSE TAKE A BIT LONGER. ZERO OF THE THE PROCEEDINGS THAT WE THAT WE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE LAST YEAR RESERVE LATE WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX PROCEEDINGS UNDER WAY. OF THAT ARE WITHIN TIME LINES. I'LL SAY THAT THERE'S ONE SET OF EXCEPTIONS WHICH IS THE THE GENERAL RATE CASES PARTICULARLY FOR THE LARGE ENERGY UTILITIES. THERE BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE CHALLENGES PARTICULARLY OF THE THE SAFETY RATE MAKING SECTIONS THAT THERE WERE ALL LEARNING HOW TO IMPROVE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD FROM FROM SOME OF THE PARTIES INCLUDING THE THE UTILITIES AND THE RIGHT PAIR ADVOCATE. THAT WE CONSIDER A FOUR YEAR -- CYCLE FOR GENERATE CASES RATHER THAN THREE WE HAVE NOT MADE THAT DECISION YET BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A WIDESPREAD UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY. OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ASKING THE UTILITIES TO PURCHASE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRY TO DO THAT WITHIN THE THREE YEAR CYCLE AND IT THAT BECOMES SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY. WELL INTO THEIR NEXT CYCLE HAVING RESOLVED WHAT THE EXPENDITURE PLANS ARE GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO CARVE IT UP BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVEN'T DECIDED IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO FOUR YEARS THERE'S NOT COMPLETE AGREEMENT WE SHOULD DO THAT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME MOMENTUM AMONG SOME PARTIES THAT DIRECTION WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO DO WITHIN. THE THREE YEAR CYCLE RATHER THAN JUST LETTING IT DRAG ON CURRENT. OF THE UTILITIES -- YOU'RE ON THE ON THE SECOND YEAR OF THE RATE. ADJUSTMENTS OF ONLY ONLY ON ONE ONLY ON ONE BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE ON ON ON THOSE RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WE JUST STARTED IN. WE TEND TO WE DON'T TEND TO DO THEM ALL AT ONCE SO WE CYCLE THEM SO THERE WERE THERE WERE ONLY PURSUING ONE OF THE MAJORS ENTITY GIVE TIME WE KICK IT OFF. AND THEN IT WOULD THEN THE OVERLAP SOME BUT IT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATION IN THE REPORT BECAUSE I DON'T FIND IT DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS FAR AS WHAT IS THE THE CURRENT TIMELINE ON THOSE RATE CASES WHERE YOU ARE. I CAN WHICH MEANS ARE YOU READY WE NOW WHERE ARE YOU YEAH I I CAN SPEAK TO THE BIG THREE ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY TO CAN'T SPEAK -- TO OTHER RATE CASES BUT FOR ON P. JEANNIE THERE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF A GENERAL RATE CASE CYCLE THEY FILED THEIR GENERATE CASE PLAN IN DECEMBER -- FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EDISON WE ARE ON SUBSTANTIALLY LATE WITH FINISHING THEIR CURRENT RATE CASE CYCLE ON BATCH YOU KNOW THE BEGINNING OF THE ACTUAL CYCLE WAS -- WHERE WE 200-019-2000 -- EIGHT AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY SEVERAL MONTHS AWAY FROM JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YES. YEAH OKAY -- AND THEN -- WERE ALSO IN THE REVIEW PROCESS OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. I SLASH -- SO CAL GASES GENERATE CASE ON IN THEIR RATE CASE -- CYCLE -- WOULD HAVE STARTED ON JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. OKAY ALSO IT WOULD HAVE STARTED BUT HASN'T STARTED HAVING STARTED SO THERE ON THAT WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED WE SHOULD MADE A FINAL DECISION BY THAT TIME SO AND YOUR ARE YOU AWARE OF A BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THE TIMING OF THESE RAPE CASES WITH. SMALLER UTILITIES UP. RELATED [inaudible] TO PHONE SERVICE I'M I'M NOT YEAH OKAY ON THE DIED UNFORTUNATE DON'T TRACK THE THE SMALL TELCO GENERATE CASES. AND SOWITH ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF POINT OUT THAT WHAT EVERYBODY IS WRESTLING WITH INCLUDING THE UTILITIES IS THE IMPACT OF THE NEW FEDERAL TAX CODES AND HOW TO ACTUALLY TRACK THAT AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS -- ON THAT BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU SOME OF THE MATERIALS FROM THAT PROCEEDING IT'S NOT MINE SO. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT WHAT IN OTHER COMMISSIONERS DOING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN. DRESSING WITH IS THE AMOUNT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THINGS THAT WE DO AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND SO USED TO BE THERE WE WERE JUST RAY MAKING AGENCY FOR UTILITIES AND WE SORT OF STOOD OFF TO THE SIDE. BUT I'LL JUST POINT TO THE AMOUNT OF I HAVE MONEY THAT PASSES THROUGH THE CPUC -- FOR ENTERED THAT LITHIUM BATTERY STORAGE OR FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY RATE PAYERS AT THE END OF LIFE TO THE JUST OVERSEAS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY BECOME A HAZARD TO COMMUNITIES THERE. SO TO WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT RECYCLING MARKET SOON IN SOME RESPECTS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TOXIC EFFECTS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- BIOCHEMISTS WE DON'T HAVE -- A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. SO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS COHERENTLY IN TO DO A GOOD JOB WE FORM ALLIANCES WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE USE FOR JUST SIGNED A NEW I'M MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL RECYCLES AND DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL AND RECYCLING IN END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF BATTERY STORAGE AND SOLAR. PHOTOVOLTAIC. PANELS. WE JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM LET LITTERING THE CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE WERE POTENTIALLY NOT BEING REUSED OF POSSIBLE -- AND IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY THAT OUR WORLD HAS CHANGED. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THE SKILLS OR THE PERSONALITY TERMINALLY? ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE OUR SEVERAL YEARS OF WORK WITH CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP NEW FUELS MAP. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THE OUR FIRE MAPS THERE THEN -- COUPLE TO NEW STANDARD AND MANAGE WE NOW HAVE THE TOUGHEST VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN THE COUNTRY. AND AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE FORESTERS WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO WHO REALLY KNOW HOW FIRES BEHAVE WHERE THE FUELS ARE SO WE HAD TO ROOM WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE TO DO THAT. WITH THEIR FIRE SCIENTISTS IN WITH THEIR FIRE ENGINEERS MANY OF WHOM WORKED SEASONALLY ON THE FIRE LINES AND SO THE TO THE EVEN THE PACE OF WHAT OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE A CHALLENGE. WE WORK WITH BOTH CAL FIRE AND YES TO DEVELOP NEW BETTER PATTERNS FOR THE D. ENERGY STATION PROGRAMS THAT -- YOU'VE TACITUS WITHIN -- SB NINE A ONE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN USING A CONTRACT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO OUR PERFORM SOME OF THE LAND USE PERMITTING THAT WE DO AROUND TRANSMISSION -- AND THEN WE HAVE A VERY A LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR ON ELECTRICITY. RELIABILITY GAS RELIABILITY WE IS WHERE WE START TO REALLY DIG IN TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND GAS MARKETS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE THE LIMITATIONS ARE PUSHED PLACED ON THE LEASE -- CANYON GAS STORAGE FACILITY. SO NEW POLICY INITIATIVES BUILDING THE CARBONIZATION PURSUANT TO SB THREE FIFTY AND SB -- FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SENATOR STERN'S BILL -- THOUGH WE HAVE A IT'S TO PROCEEDINGS UNDER WAY ON DISK AND WE ARE WE ARE DIGGING IN HARD ON THE NEW -- S. CHIP BOB PROGRAMS -- FOR BECOME A BATTERY STORAGE. I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS TRACKING THE PROCESS TO ACTUALLY CLOSE DIABLO CANYON -- AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE D. COMMISSION ACCOUNTS. AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE THE TRANSMISSION ELECTRIFICATION WE HAVE FOURTEEN DIFFERENT PILOT PROGRAMS OUT ON THE STREETS. I WANT TO POINT TO A AN AREA OF ENORMOUS SUCCESS OR UTILITY DIVERSITY CONTRACTING PROGRAM. MOST PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT KNOW IT'S A PROCESS VOLUNTARY PROCESS THAT GOES BACK TO TWO IS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GWEN MOORE. WHO CALLED ON THE UTILITIES T. K. ACTUALLY AVOID LEAKAGE LEAKING THEIR CONTRACT AHLERS SAID OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? AND SO INSTEAD. WE'VE ASKED THEM TO TAKE THE EXTRA EFFORT TO FIND CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS YOU REPRESENT PARSONS OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS ECONOMY THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH A VERY LARGE CORPORATION. SO DISABLED VATS -- WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES ON IN NATIVE AMERICAN OF THIS IN THE IN THE DESERT. ALL HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE UTILITY'S PARTICULARLY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND THE GAS UTILITIES HAVE DONE A FAIRLY GOOD JOB AT THIS POINT. WE CAN MEASURE TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. BILLION WITH A B. THEY GO TO PARTS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WOULD THAT WOULD THAT WE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE SEEN INVESTMENT THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE EMPLOYMENT. THAT THAT THAT ENERGY PROVIDERS DO FOR THEIR STAFF OF PEOPLE WHO CONTRACT WITH THEM TO TO BUILD POWER PLANTS. THIS ISN'T JUST JOBS ACTUALLY BUILD THE CAPACITY OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO FURTHER -- RETAIN WEALTH AT THE HIGHER PEOPLE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REST OF THE ECONOMY SO I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT. THIS YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE ARE ON BY A CALL WE CALL THE EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY TO SIT BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND TO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. HOW THERE AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING? IN FRESNO BECAUSE AS WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT IT WE START TO SEE THAT THERE PORTIONS OF THE STATE WHO HAVE NOT HAD AS MUCH SUCCESS PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS AS OTHERS. WE ALSO NOTE. THAT AS THERE ARE MANY -- QUESTIONS OF THE UTILITY BUSINESS THEIR DEPARTING AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATIVE -- CHANGES AND ROOFTOP SOLAR FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS EVEN THOUGH THE PROGRAM IS GROWING. IT'S MORE THE EXISTING -- YOU IN RIDING THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM WE'RE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING THESE OTHER PARTIES INTO IT I KNOW THAT SENATOR BRADFORD HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AS WELL IN THIS IS PROPOSING LEGISLATION. SO FOR A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IT'S ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY BUILDING AND PROSPERITY IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE WOULD SEE THAT PROSPERITY. AND I THINK WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT -- I WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON THREE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING. AND I THINK THAT. ARE YOU KNOW I'VE I LIVED IN A FORM OF DENIAL CLIMATE AND I'LL FOR NUMBER OF YEARS I THOUGHT IF WE WERE JUST REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN AVOIDING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I THINK THE THAT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE ROUTE THOROUGHLY UNTOWARD WINDOW VANCE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT OUR STANDARDS. DON'T REALLY MATCH THE NEW CHALLENGES MRS IS IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING TO A MORE MODERN. SAFETY PROGRAM THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS ALONG THAT ROUTE SO FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN JUST HAVING COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS WHICH FORMS A CEILING. ON SAFETY WE REQUIRED UTILITIES TO EXPLAIN HOW THEIR EXPENDITURES TARGET MAJOR RISKS. AND ACTUALLY REDUCE THEM THAT ACTUALLY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF SAFETY OVERTIME. IT'S A WHICH IS A TOOL TO DRIVE INNOVATION. WE'RE STILL. EARLY IN THE STAGE BUT WE THINK THAT THAT'S A PATTERN FOR SUCCESS. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO THING AT THE C. P. U. C. AS A RATE MAKING AGENCY WITH SAFETY AUDITS. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH BUT A ROUGH CALCULATION OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACTUALLY DO. AN ANNUAL INSPECTION OF ALL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. CAME UP WITH SOME PLACE AROUND TEN THOUSAND NEW EMPLOYEES AT THE CPUC. WE TAKE THAT DOWN TO A FIVE YEAR CYCLE WHICH IS WHAT WE DO FOR OUR PIPELINE SAFETY UNDER THE FEDERAL -- PIPELINE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SAFETY AGENCIES RULES. THEN IT WOULD STILL BE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT A COST OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SO I CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS IN TERMS OF SAFETY BECAUSE THIS IS -- THIS IS A BECAUSE THERE IS NO STATEWIDE SAFETY AGENCY. ONE ONE WE TEND TO USE NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES HOW DO WE DEVELOP STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS THE THIS. SPACE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WERE LIVING WITH I HATE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR RHYTHM INTERRUPT YOU HERE BUT DO WE KNOW HOW MANY EMPLOYEES OF THE UTILITIES WHOSE PRINCIPAL JOB HISTORY. THESE UTILITIES INTERNALLY. AND HAVE IS THERE A WAY TO SOMEHOW TO A SHIFT. OF THOSE POSITIONS OVER TO THE CPC IF IF YOU SEE A IN OUR A CHALLENGES SENATOR IT'S TAKEN US TWO YEARS TO GET AN EXTRA HUNDRED SPACES FOR POLICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH TEN THOUSAND NO. WORRIES. BUT ARE THE THE THE EMPLOYEES FOR THE UTILITIES. FIRST OF ALL ARE THE THEIR NUMBER TWO ARE THEY PERFORM SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SEPARATELY AND SO WE'VE DONE A A SAFETY AUDIT. OCC CITY CULTURE ADDITIVE OF FIVE P. JEANNIE AND I THINK THAT -- YOU HAVE PASSED US IN -- IN SB NINE A ONE OF REPLICATING THAT FOR THE OTHER LARGE ARE YOU ENERGY UTILITIES. SO WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE HAZARD HIS CHNGED IN THE THE OVERALL RISK IS INCREASED BECAUSE OF CHANGING CONDITIONS. THE UTILITIES TEND. TO AT LEAST P. JEANNIE TEND TO USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN WHEN THE AUDITOR'S ONE OUT TO TALK TO SOME OF THE LINE CREWS. WHO I DO HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN -- THEY REPORTED AS MANY AS NINETEEN DIFFERENT SAFETY PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAD TO COMPLY WITH. THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO AND REMEMBER ALL OF THIS THE PROCESS STEPS THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE. AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND OURSELVES IS SAFETY IS TO IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK. IT'S WHAT YOU DO. IT'S THE THINGS YOU DO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WHEN YOU GO TO VISIT A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. WHERE A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY VOLUNTARY BEST PRACTICES ABOVE AND BEYOND AND ARE SEIZE STANDARDS? IT'S DEVELOPED THROUGH A UTILITY PROGRAM CALLED IN PRO. ANA INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR POWER OPERATORS. THEY CONSTANTLY HER TRADING INFORMATION WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT THEY DON'T FEEL IS A PROPER WAY THERE THERE'S AN OUTAGE. THAT ISN'T GOOD FOR DUE TO A NEW SOURCE. THEY ALL TALK ABOUT IT THEY ALL THEY ALL TRY TO TAKE THAT LEARNING AND TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO THEIR DAILY PRACTICES THE TRAIN FOR IT. AND THEY MEMORIALIZES SO THAT IT BECOMES NOT JUST WHAT THEY THINK BUT WHAT THEY DO THEY PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE THINK. BUT IT GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT AND SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO GET. TO I'VE BEEN A IN IN OUR FIRST AUDIT WHICH IS OF P. JEANNIE WE FOUND THAT THE TOP LEADERSHIP FRICKLEY WAS NOT. AS FOCUSED AS WE THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO BE ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION. SO ON THE OTHER UTILITIES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T YET CONDUCTED THOSE AUDITS I CAN'T SAY. I WILL SAYTHAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN AN EMERGENCY COMES UP IT'S FREQUENTLY THE LINE PERSONNEL WHO STEP UP USE THEIR INITIATIVE. AND AND TAKE THE RIGHT ACTIONS ISSUES. IS THE SAN BRUNO DISASTER WHERE IT WAS A YARD SUPERVISOR WHO WAS DRIVING IN HIS CAR. KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE VALVE WAS A NEED TO BE TURNED OFF WENT TO THE YARD GOT HIS TOOLS WENT THERE AND DID IT MANUALLY BECAUSE THE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THE OPERATIONS CENTER. WAS NOT WORKING THEY HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH FIELD THEY HAD NO VISIBILITY ON WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS HE JUST KNEW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. SO I THINK THAT THAT THE SCALE OF WHAT UTILITIES TO THE THE AGING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO CHANGING CONDITIONS IN LARGE PARTS OF WHAT THEY DO THIS IS THIS IS ALL IN SOME RESPECTS. UNCHARTED TERRITORY. AND THEN COME BACK TO WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO BUT I THINK THAT THAT SEE A LONGER CONVERSATION AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT IS A IT'S ALL HAPPENING WITH IN THIS WORLD WHERE THE NATURE OF THE ROLE OF THE LEAST THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES IS CHANGING. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AS THEY GO THROUGH THAT IT'S GOING TO BE-HARDER FOR THEM TO SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. PARTICULARLY TO LEADERSHIP LEVEL SO. THAT'S A SECOND TOPIC THAT I KNOW THE YEARS CONSIDERING HAVING HEARING LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THIS QUESTION OF HOW CUSTOMERS DEPARTING FOR BOTH NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THAT'S ONE AXIS OF HOW PEOPLE CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE CHOICES TO PROVIDE THE ROLLER TRICITY. BUT ALSO SOME FORD FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- IN I I ALSO SAY IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION AS HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH THE CONSULTANT TO THE TO THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ASKING. WHY SHOULD WE BE PREPARING FOR A FUTURE THAT IS AUTONOMOUS ELECTRIC VEHICLES WERE THE INFRASTRUCTURES COULD LIKELY TO BE THE AND BASED ON CORPORATION ARCHER CENTRAL RECHARGE CHARGING? OR SHOULD WE BE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN WHICH CASE IT'S GOING TO BE A WORK PLACER IN PLACE OF RESIDENCE. THE THE THE WHERE SPENDING MONEY THROUGH THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE SPENDING RATE PAYER DOLLARS BASED ON AND DIRECTION THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US IN SB. THREE FIFTY AND WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF MONEY. WAITING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THESE INNOVATIONS ARE GONNA BRING TO US IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE TRANSPORTATION IS GOING TO BE PLAYED OUT IN THE FUTURE -- ICE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE PEOPLE GO. WE JUST KNOW THE WHO WHAT WHERE YOU'VE ASKED US TO DO WHICH IS TO PROVIDE PARTICULAR KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS YET. AND SO -- TELECOMMUNICATIONS. I'LL JUST SAY THAT -- THAT THERE OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES PEOPLE IN WHO DEPART FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM LAND LINE PHONES. TOWARDS CELL PHONES TRYING TO GIVE WARNINGS FOR EXAMPLE DURING DISASTERS HAS BECOME PROBLEMATIC WE HOPE TO HAVE A MEMO TO YOU FAIRLY SOON THE THAT SYNTHESIZES SOME OF THE DIFFERENT REPORTS WE'VE SEEN FROM WILDFIRES AND AND AND AND FLOOD DISASTERS. LESS THAN 50% OF THE FOLKS WHO ON THE COUNTY. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN AND SONOMA TRACKED IN THEIR TEST ACTUALLY GOT ANY OF THE WARNINGS THAT THE COUNTY PUT OUT. SO WE COULD REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO DO THIS BUT I GIVEN THAT THE WAY THE YOU REACH PEOPLE IS THROUGH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE DONE. AND SO I AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT SAFETY A GROW INCREASINGLY CONCERNED. THAT THE CPC IS NOT AS PREPARED AS WE SHOULD BE. BUT I ALSO HAVE THIS FEELING THAT THEIR BIG GAP BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES BETWEEN INDUSTRIES AND AND THERE'S NOT THAT CENTRAL SAFETY -- ENTITY IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY CAN GIVE US DIRECTION [inaudible] SO ON I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO JUMP IN OTHERWISE I WOULD JUST GO ON TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE WE HAVE A CHART HERE. WHICH IS BEHIND ME SO I MAY BE HARD FOR SOME OF YOU TO SEE BUT I THINK WE ALSO GAVE YOU HANDOUTS. SO FROM YOU BE FINALIZED THE LEGISLATION IN OCTOBER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST AND WE REALLY JUMPED IN -- TO TO TO OUR PLAY WE WANTED TO REALLY KIND OF FOCUS ON GETTING CORD PIECES DONE. BEFORE THIS SUMMER'S FIRE SEASON. SO WE IMMEDIATELY -- CREATED DAY PROCEEDING TO LOOK AT THE STRESS TEST THE YOU INCLUDED IN SB NINE A ONE WE HAVE BEEN AUGMENTING THE PRE MANAGEMENT PLANS WE GOT THE FIRST ROUND OF THE NEW. WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLANS WERE YOU WE'VE JOINED WITH CAL FIRE TO ACTUALLY REVIEW THOSE PLANS. WE HOPE TO ADOPT THEM IN TIME FOR THE UTILITIES TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE ACTING ON THEM FOR THROUGH THE THE THE SUMMER. WITH DAN VERY ENERGETIC IN TERMS OF WHAT. ADDITIONAL THINGS WE NEED TO DO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THE THE VICTIMS OF DISASTERS -- SO I'LL JUST KIND REFER YOU TO THIS CHART WERE GRINDING THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS IT'S IT'S A BURDEN ON US. OUT OF OUR FORTY JUDGES SEVEN THE NUMBER ASSIGNED FULL TIME TO THESE PROCEEDINGS -- THAT MEANS THAT OTHER THINGS PROBABLY WON'T GET DONE AT THE PACE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DONE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANALYSTS SO FOR EXAMPLE ON LOOKING AT A WILD FIRE MANAGEMENT PLAN WE CAN CHECK THE BOXES. TO SAY THAT THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU TOLD US THE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE MEANINGFUL EXPERTISE IN FIRES IN FIRE MANAGEMENT TO REALLY SAY WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE KIND OF SAFETY THAT WE ALL EXPECT TO SEE. WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM FOR THEIR PERSONAL TO HELP US EVALUATE THAT SO I THINK WE'LL GET AMOUNT TIMELY. BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR SKILL SETS ARE WHAT THE WHAT THE LAW HAS ASKED US TO DO IN THE PAST. IN THE NATURE OF THE CHANGING WORLD THAT WERE IN SO HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I JUST. WANTED TO COME BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE TIMING OF THE RATE CASES BECAUSE HERE WERE OF OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUES RELATED TO THE WIRE WILD FRES AND WORKING TO HARD DARK RED. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT COMES FROM. THE THE A BUDGET BUDGETS A KAMADO OF THE THE RATE CASES. AND WHEN I HEAR FOR YEARS ON A ON A CASE IT JUST STARTED IN JANUARY -- IT SOUNDS LIKE [inaudible] WE'RE NOT [inaudible] IMMEDIATELY RESPOND. BEING RESPONSIVE TO KIND OF THE THREAD AND HAND. IS THERE A WAY TO AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS SEEK TO ADDRESS KIND OF THE THREAT TO THE RATE CASE ALLOW SOME KIND OF DECISIONS TO BE MADE. EITHER X. YOU KNOW. SHORTEN. THE DECISION PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT. IS IT SEEMS EASY FOR ME SET UP HERE JUST KIND OF WELL TO A AGAIN OUT ALL OFFERS I HAVE IN THE PAST IF YOU WANT TO GET THESE THINGS OUT FASTER MAKE A SINGLE DECISION MAKER WILL SPEED RIGHT THROUGH IT. BUT THERE'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY YEAH AND THE INTEREST IN ACTUALLY HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE BE ABLE TO SATISFY THEM FOR THEMSELVES THAT THESE OR ARE WISE EXPENDITURES. VERSUS SPEED WHAT WE DO DO IS WE ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO MAKE THOSE EXPENDITURES AND RECORD THEM IN SPECIAL ACCOUNTING. OF POOLS WHICH WE CALL YOU THE CATASTROPHIC REALLY YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND WE ON ROOM THAT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE AS THEY COME FORWARD TO US AND SAY WE THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN SPENDING MONEY NOW. WILL OPEN UP THAT THAT THAT COUNTY AND SAY OKAY FINE GO AHEAD AND SAY HAS A REQUEST. THAT BE DONE OR YOU CAN RICK QUEST THEM DOES COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T CUT CORNERS ANYMORE. YOUR VIEW OF WHAT YOU TOLD US IN MANY WAYS WE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT THIS IS HOW WE MAKE THAT TRANSPARENT. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS -- IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO WE ON THE MY QUESTION IS JUST WHAT STARTS UP PROCESS. USUALLY THEY TELL US THAT THEY'RE READY TO START SPENDING THROUGH APPLICATION OF I'LL JUST PASS IT OFF DEAD SINCE HE ACTUALLY HANDLES THAT WARRANT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL WE DO TAKE A VOTE ON IT. AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'VE TOLD US TO BE TRANSPARENT AND THAT'S AND ALL THAT IS FINE. I'M. YEAH NOT TO GET TOO IN THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF A GENERAL RATE CASES BUT YET IF THE% UTILITY WANTS TO DO I'D I'D SPENDING -- BETWEEN RATE CASES SO IT'S SPENDING A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT APPROVED IN THE LAST RATE CASE -- WHAT THEY CAN DO IS I CAN COME IN AND REQUEST OPEN WHAT'S CALLED A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT? INTO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE SAFETY RELATED SPENDING TO THE WILD FIRES. I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- OF MAIL FROM LAST YEAR ACTUALLY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION AND SAID WE WANT -- WE HAVE A PLAN TO DO FOR OF THEIR LINE SO THAT THEIR MORE FIRE RESISTANT. ON IN AS PART OF THAT IF WE APPROVE THAT PLAN AND THEY WOULD ALSO BE AUTHORIZED TO GO AHEAD AND COLLECT THE MONEY AND RATES FOR THAT -- WITH THE WILD FOR MITIGATION PLANS THE STATUTE ACTUALLY SAYS THE A WIN YOU APPROVE YOU SEE WHEN YOU APPROVED THE PLANS. ALSO APPROVED A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO START COLLECTING -- ARE ACTUALLY NOT CASE ALLOW THEM TO START BY TRACKING THE COST -- AND THEN IN THE NEXT GENERATE CASE OR IN ANOTHER PROCEEDING DEPENDING UPON TIMING IN ISSUES WE WOULD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE REASONABLENESS OF THE COST -- SO IN THOSE CASES WHERE THEY NEED TO SPEND ON SOMETHING BETWEEN GENERATE CASES THERE'S A MECHANISM OUT THERE FOR THEM TO START TRACKING THE COST RIGHT AWAY. AND THEN WE WOULD DO -- A REVIEW OF THE REASON ON THIS OF THE EXPENSES OF LATER ON IN THE PROCESS OKAY. I WILL GO TO SENATOR DODD FOLLOWED BY SENATOR RUBIO AND THEN WE HAVE HILTON AND STERN OKAY -- IF YOU. OKAY TO PARK TO PART QUESTION -- ONE JUST EXPOUNDING ON THAT RATE CASE -- WORD OF PROCESS RIGHT NOW ON A RATE CASE OR OR SOME RULE MAKING -- FOR THE NINE OH ONE WE CALL REPAIR REPAIR PROTECTION. BONDS CRACKED. IT I'M ASSUMING. I'LL JUST AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT PROBABLY SINCE THEY'RE A BANKRUPTCY. THAT THAT'S PROBABLY. NOT A PRIORITY ANY LONGER OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT KNOWS PROCEEDING NO I SPENT THE WEEKEND READING PEOPLE'S REPLY COMMENTS ON ON THAT SO IT'S UNDER WAY WE HOPE TO HAVE A METHODOLOGY. THE PEOPLE CAN SEE. SET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE THE WITH BOND. FOR ALL YOU HAVE IS REALLY ROUGH ESTIMATES USUALLY WHEN. YOU DO A RECOVERY ACTION. YOU COME FORWARD TO THE P. YOU IN C. AND SAID. HERE'S WHAT WE HAD TO PAY OUT TO SETTLE ALL THESE CLAIMS AGAINST THIS SOMETIMES THE UTILITY. JUST HAS TO PAY CLAIM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR EQUIPMENT. BECAUSE THE PROBLEM. THERE'S NOT A A A A THEY COLLECT NECESSARILY FOR A A FAILURE TO OBSERVE STANDARDS IT JUST HAPPENED. THAT'S INVERSE CONDEMNATION THEY'RE THE FIRST PAY ARE THEY CAN COLLECT FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES SOMETIMES OTHER PARTIES WHO CONTRIBUTED. EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE MALIBU FIRE TWO YEARS AGO THEY WERE CAUSED BY A TELEPHONE COMPANIES EQUIPMENT ON THE POLLS. FOR A SIMILAR CASE WERE CABLE COMPANY AND SAN DIEGO DID THAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND THREE FIRES SO THEY'LL COLLECT ALL THAT MONEY. THEY'LL THEY'LL USE THEIR OWN INSURANCE POOL THEN I'LL COME AND SAY HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAD TO PAY OUT. AND WHAT IT COST FOR US TO TO PAY ALL THESE CLAIMS. WE PERFORM A REASONABLENESS TEST YOU CHANGED THE RULES FOR US FOR CLIMATE RELATED FIRES. SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT YOU ALSO HAVE ALLOWED THEM. THEN TO SECURITIZED THE COST RATHER THAN DUMPING IT ALL INTO RATE PAYERS IN A SINGLE YEAR SEE YOU SPREAD IT OUT OVER YOU OVER SEVERAL YEARS. IT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR THEM TO SATISFY ALL THEIR OTHER CREDITORS AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE NOT ALL THEIR CASH GETS TIED UP IN THAT ONE TOOL WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP THAT METHODOLOGY IF YOU COME FORWARD WITH THE CLAIM. HERE'S HOW WE WOULD EVALUATE WHAT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERSUS WHAT RATE PAYERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR UNDER THE NEW TEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US IN SB NINE A ONE REALLY IT'S TO QUESTION I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SECOND -- PART OF THAT QUESTION AND I'LL GET TO MY LAST ONE IS. YOU INDICATED A ONE OF THE MEETINGS THAT PERHAPS -- THE CBC MAY HAVE THE ABILITY IN THE FUTURE. ON THAT GO TO HOLD TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT -- ELSEWHERE. IN JUST READING BETWEEN THE LINES WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON NST GT. THAT MAY BE SOMETHING. THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE DO YOU HAVE YOU DONE WORK WITH YOUR ATTORNEYS OR ANY. TO HAVE ANY FURTHER -- OPINION ON THAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE DONE THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE THAT SOME OF OUR STAFF IT HAD CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF WHO BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY THAT'S THE PAIN OF SOME OF MY ATTORNEYS. SO OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE QUIT SAYING THAT -- IF IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE FOR US TO APPLY THE SAME TESS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEN I WAS SO HOPE THE WILL GIVE US OF PERMISSION TO DO THAT. IS -- AT THIS POINT IS VERY CLOUDY AND WE KEEP GETTING MIX I KEEP GETTING MIXED MESSAGES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. JUST JUST A POINT OF CLARITY HERE SO -- AS AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL ON THERE'S PROVISIONS THAT DEAL WITH WILD FIRES IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEIR PROVISION TO DEAL WITH WILD FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND FORWARD AND THERE IS -- THE IT DOES THE BILL DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS ANYTHING. FOR WILDFIRES WOULD HAPPEN IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON AS FAR AS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SECURITIZATION F OF COSTS TO ALLOW THE UTILITY TO GO OUT AND DO A REDDIQUETTE DEDICATED RATE COMPONENT. AND COLLECT COSTS THAT WE AUTHORIZED EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE PRUDENT -- OR BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT S. THRESHOLD ON THE STATUTORY AUTHORITIES VERY EXPLICITLY FOR WILDFIRES IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHERE THERE'S SOME QUESTION ON WHERE OUR AUTHORITY IS IS THAT ABILITY TO APPLY THE NEW. NC STANDARDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND AND SB NINE A ONE AS IT RELATES. TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE DEFINE -- PRUDENCE HE THERE IS SOME QUESTION IF WE GOT A PROCEEDING TO LOOK AT THE FOR AND SEE OF IT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE. WHAT WITH THE STANDARDS WE USE THEIR AND COULD WE USE -- THE STANDARDS IN THE BILL EVEN THOUGH THOSE STANDARDS -- WERE DRAFTED FOR TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND BEYOND WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT. I THINK I WILL ON THE STICK WITH PRESENT PICKERS POINT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DIVIDED -- OPINION ON THAT -- I WILL SAY WE DO HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY ON ON HOW WE DEFINE FOR AGENCY AND WE COULD LOOK AT IT BROADER THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST. YEAH MY SUGGESTION IS YOU MAY NEED THAT BEFORE -- THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO APPLY ON THAT BUT THAT IS ONLY POSSIBLE BUT HERE'S MY FEARS GIVEN THE CLOUDY ANSWERS THAT WE RECEIVED ALL AROUND. IT'S PRETTY LIKELY THAT THIS WILL BE THE CPUC IN THE COURTS. AND IF MARKETS ARE LOOKING FOR CERTAINTY. THAT IS NOT GONNA SARACENIC GIVE THEM WITH ME IF I COULD BUILD ON THAT I MEAN THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES SAY RIGHT NOW. ON IS THEY NEED MORE CERTAINTY AROUND THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ON COST RECOVERY. ON IN WE CAN'T PROVIDE THAT CERTAINTY UNTIL THERE'S AN ACTUAL APPLICATION PROCEED IN FRONT OF US. SO A QUICKER WAY TO PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY WOULD BE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE FAIR ENOUGH I APPRECIATE STRAIGHT ANSWERS I REALLY DO -- FINALLY MISTER CHAIR -- YOU INDICATED EARLIER THAT -- THE TO SEE IF YOU SEE DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF YOUR VALIDATING ELISE RIGHT NOW VALIDATING WHETHER -- I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT IT WAS -- YOUR REGARDING SAFETY -- WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT ON THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES. IN NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT SOON ENOUGH. YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE -- TO MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS. RIGHT NOW WE GOT A SITUATION WHERE PGE PRIVILEGE ISSUES P. GENIE IS AN EXAMPLE. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DETERMINING WHAT WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DO THE WORK. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT CERTIFIED THAT THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE. AND THEY GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION AND YOU AUDIT. THAT TO ME SOUNDS IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY BEING A MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKS REALLY EASY. AND NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. THREE OR FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO SO I TOTALLY GET THAT. BUT THAT SOUNDS PRETTY CRAZY TO ME AND I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS. WHAT ABOUT HAVING IT? SAID YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERTISE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CAL FIRE DOES WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH CAL FIRE HELP IS TO REVIEW THE PLAN IS SO IF THEY'VE GOT THE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING OUT THERE AND AUDITING THEIR OWN STUFF. WHAT DID I THINK THE -- THE CHAIRMAN WAS GOV. SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERRING THE THOSE -- LABOR [inaudible] FROM. PGA IN THE COST OF THAT THE CALIFORNIA HAVE A THIRD PARTY. OVERSIGHT OF YOU KNOW THE TRIMMING OF THESE TREES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DONE SAFELY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. TO GET THAT FROM. THE POWERS THAT THAT THEY BE GIVEN THE P. JEANNIE THAT WE CAN COUNT. SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE A STEP FORWARD BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS HOLISTICALLY I THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PIECES THAT WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT. SO WE LEARNED THE HARD WAY. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE? THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR PROBLEMS THAT ARE EMERGING. AND TO BEGIN TO SAY OKAY. WE NEED TO REALLY BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE WAY THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. OF WE ARE HAVING MORE. PRECIPITATION FALL IS RAIN RATHER THAN SNOW. IN ALL OF THE STANDARDS FOR OUR DAM SAFETY AND ARE DAM OPERATION -- BUILT AROUND. TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF METEOROLOGY THAT ASSUME TO HIRES THE SNOW PACK. IN LESS WAS FREE REIGN WHAT DO WE DO THEN TO DEVELOP NEW STANDARDS WHEN WE HAVE STANDARDS WE TEND TO USE NATIONAL STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE OUR PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS SAFETY MATERIALS -- PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY TAKE OUR FOLKS TRAIN THEM AND WE USE THEIR STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A NEW HOUSE OR LIKE. A GAS STORAGE FACILITY WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WELLS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY AND HE COMES UP. WE SORT OF DEPEND ON THEM AND DOGGER TO DEVELOP NEW RULES THAT WE ENFORCE FOR THE UTILITIES HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THAT AND HOW DO WE DEVELOP THOSE NEW STANDARDS. SO THOSE ARE TWO COMPONENTS. THEN THE THIRD PIECE OF IT IS HOW DO YOU POLICE. WERE IN AUDITING AGENCY BECAUSE WERE RATE MAKING AGENCY. THOSE ARE THE TOOLS WHEN WE STARTED WE HAD ENGINEERS AND ACCOUNTANTS. AND THAT'S BEEN THE TRADITION IF YOU WANT IS TO HAVE THAT POLICING POWER WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO BUT I WILL ALSO I'LL JUST A LEAVE IT TO YOU IN YOUR EXAMINATION AS TO WHETHER IT SHOULD BE IN THE CPUC. OR I TO BE IN SOME KIND OF A SAFETY THEN YOU NEED A REAL ENFORCEMENT GRADUATED ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WE'RE STRUGGLING TO DEVELOP THAT WE HAVE INCOMPLETE CITATION AREA. AUTHORITY FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF UTILITIES WE HAVE IT FOR SOME BUT NOT FOR OTHERS. AND THEN. THEN YOU START TO ACTUALLY HAVE WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE'S IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE SAFETY AGENCY ARE. WHAT WE DO IS THE BACK UP THAT RATE MAKING THAT WE DO WE GO OUT TO ACTUALLY AUDIT? BOOKS TO SEE IF THEY SPENT THE MONEY THE WAY THEY SAID THE DEAL WITH THE BOOKS WORK AND THEN WE DO SPOT CHECKS. TO SEE WHETHER THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIELD. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT'S WITH THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO DO. IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT GOD BLESS TELUS THE NEW. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION I'M AT TAKE A LITTLE BIT -- BACK. IN THE SAME VEIN AS THOSE QUESTIONS FOR YEARS YOU SAY YOU HAD A FIRST AUDIT THAT FOUND THAT DOT THE LEADERSHIP WASN'T DOING OR WASN'T FOCUSED ON WHAT THE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT AND GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU MEAN. SO AFTER THE THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION -- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT HAPPENS SOME OF THAT'S ON THE TECHNICAL LEVEL. BUT WE ACTUALLY S. AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL OF NOT JUST LOOK AT P. JEANNIE BUT TO LOOK AT THE CPSC. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY EMPHASIZE WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY CULTURE. AND THAT'S KIND OF A HARD THING TO REALLY QUANTIFY IT'S A QUALITATIVE SET OF BEHAVIORS. SO WE HIRED A FIRM OUT OF NEW YORK THAT HAS DONE A VARIETY OF CORPORATE AUDITS INCLUDING SAFETY AUDITS THEY'RE CALLED NORTH STAR I GOT THEIR NAME FROM THE THE COMMISSIONERS AND IN NEW YORK OUR TREES OF WOMAN. AND WE ASK THEM TO GO THROUGH AND JUST DO A THOROUGH GOING PROGRAM AUDIT. OF THE SAFETY PROGRAMS AT P. JEANNIE US BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT SAFETY ON A DAY TO DAY. BASIS IF YOU'RE AN AUDIT AGENCY YOU'RE LOOKING AT EXPENDITURES AND ACTUALLY THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAMS. THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT PEOPLE DO. DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW THE THEY DO IT AND WE WANTED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. SO WE CAN'T WE GOT WE GOT A FAIRLY -- SIGNIFICANT REPORT ABOUT A YEAR AND EIGHT MONTHS AGO THAT THAT BASICALLY SAID. THAT THERE WERE A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS AT EVERY LEVEL WITHIN P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF SAFETY AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ITSELF WAS NOT ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND NOT BEING PERSISTENT. THEY HAD A SAFETY COMMITTEE. IT WAS THE NUCLEAR AND AND SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THEY ACTUALLY DID TRACK THINGS. BUT THEY WEREN'T ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS NOR WAS THE REST OF THE BOARD ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO THAT'S A SIGN THE DIRECTORS PROBLEM PARTICULARLY AFTER THE SAN BRUNO [inaudible] EXPLOSION. IN IN TO THIS DAY -- POINTED THIS OUT PUBLICLY FIVE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR MEMBERS OF P. JEANNIE ARE ACTUALLY ON THE BOARD WERE ON THE BOARD AT THE TIME SEEMED BURNER STILL THERE. THAT'S SINCE THIS MESSAGE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. IT THAT THAT THE AT THE TIRES LEVELS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING THAT I'VE I'VE POINTED OUT IS THAT THE THEN CEO PETER DAR RETIRED RETIRED WITH A THIRTY EIGHT DOLLAR A RETIREMENT BONUS MOSTLY BECAUSE IN. TERMS OF SHARES. TWENTY AUTHORS THIRTY EIGHT YOU SAID -- THIRTY EIGHT MILLION SORRY YEAH. SO THERE IS THAT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE BOARD IN THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL THEN WE JUST DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE ADOPTED. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO THEM OR TO US WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT ARE WORKING MOST EFFECTIVELY. SO IT IS A IN IN THE ONE OF THE THE AUDITOR'S SAID TO ME THEY WERE JUST TAKING EVERY GOOD IDEA THE SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH IT AND TRYING IT. BUT WITHOUT THE TOOLS IN PLACE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHICH WERE EFFECTIVE WHEN WE'RE NOT AFFECTIVE. AND SO THAT TO ME IS IS IS ANOTHER SET OF CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. THEY THEY THAT I I'LL BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU THE REPORT IT'S CLASSIC COVERS ABOUT HUNDRED FORTY PAGES IT'S VERY COMPLETE. WE ASKED WE ACTUALLY MADE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT IN ASKING QUESTIONS WE CONTINUE TO FIND AT THEIR LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION -- AND SO WE'RE NOW AT THE POINT WHAT'S THE RIGHT REMEDY. AND WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU FIND THAT KIND OF OF OF CHALLENGES WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END STARTED THIS PROCESS. IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A GOOD RECORD AND TO PROVE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL STEPS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE WERE PROCEDURAL ORGANIZATION WE HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT WE CAN'T MAKE. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO A LARGE CORPORATION WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD BASIS FOR DOING. NOW THE QUESTION IS. WHAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE SAFETY? WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE'VE HAD I'D SEE OTHER THING I SPENT THE WEEKEND READING IS IS COMMENTS IN THE SAFETY CULTURE AUDIT OF P. JEANNIE. WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO PROPOSE MUNICIPAL IS ATION OF THE COMPANY BREAKING IT UP INTO SMALLER UNITS SEPARATING OFF THE GAS UTILITY PUTTING PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE BOARDS? SO WE HAVE SUCH A ROBUST ENOUGH -- ON THE RECORD NOW THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY START TO ANALYZE IT TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS I SUSPECT THAT THEY WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF ISSUES ON A RISE IN THE GOVERNOR SIXTY DAY PLAN OR IN THE BANKRUPTCY. SO SAID TO HELP A LITTLE BIT JUST REAL QUICK YOU SAID BEHAVIORS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY BUT YOU JUST I THINK YOU DISCUSSED NINETEEN PROGRAMS THAT WERE ADOPTED THAT YOU SAID THAT THEY HAD TO COMPLY WITH -- ARE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT IDEAS THAT PEOPLE PUT TOGETHER AS MANY THAT WORK IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MANY AS NINETEEN PROGRAMS AND BUT THE THE CHALLENGE BECOMES IS IT MAYBE SOME OF THEM DO WORK. BUT IF YOU HAVE TO THINK OF NINETEEN DIFFERENT CHECKLIST WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD SOMETIMES. MORE IS ACTUALLY LESS. BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING QUICK DECISIONS. ON THE BEST WAY TO CLAMP DOWNA LEAKING -- PLASTIC GAS PIPE. SO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE SAFETY PROGRAMS SAFETY PROTOCOLS THE CHECKLIST. SET OF BEHAVIORS THAT YOU EMPLOY IN THAT SITUATION PRETTY CLEAR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE TRYING TO IS SHOULD BE DOING THIS CHECKLIST -- THAT CHECKLIST REAL QUICKLY SO WHO'S CHECKING ON THOSE -- NINETEEN LESS IS THERE SOMEONE THAT'S VETTING THEM TO SEE WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND YOU JUST SAID A RIGHT NOW HAVING TOO MANY DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK BEST A WHOSE. WEAVING THEM OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE A CONTRACT WITH NORTHSTAR THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN SOME OF THESE THINGS WE ALSO ARE DEVELOPING SKILLS WITHIN OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WORK INDUSTRIES THAT RANGE FROM -- TRANSPORTATION NET - COMPANIES -- TO CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS BUSES TO TELCOS WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF REGULATION TO ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO GAS UTILITIES. SO. AGAIN HAVING THAT DEEP EXPERTISE IN THE BEST KIND OF SAFETY PROGRAM WHAT THE NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES ARE. WILL BE TOUGH AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT FOR THE KIND OF FIRES THAT WE'RE SEEING. THERE ARE NO BEST PRACTICES ELSEWHERE WE STE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WE CAN TALK TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIENCES WITH AS WE DO OUR THE AUSTRALIANS. SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE ON THE CUTTING EDGE AND YOU COULD YOU THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING. BY EXPERIENCE OF THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE INTERNALLY ON THIS STUFF THERE'S NOT A OFF THE SHELF SOLUTION. THAT WE CAN FIND. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU TERM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'VE GOT THREE QUESTIONS INTO WHO WERE ACTUALLY FOLLOWS FROM THE SENATOR RUBIO AND SENATOR DODD. OF IT IS YOU KNOW THE OF I'VE HAD A STRONG OPINION ON THE MANDATORY REPORTING ISSUE THAT -- CAME ABOUT LAST YEAR ON ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITIES IF YOU ADOPTED. IT CREATED AS YOU KNOW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS WHICH FELL INTO TWO CATEGORIES MANDATORY REPORTING OF THE POTENTIAL VIOLATION. POSES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY THREAT TO THE PUBLIC OR UTILITY STAFF. AT INVOLUNTARY REPORTING FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS THAT BECAUSE SYSTEM WIDE IMPACTION IT'S JUST THE FRAUD AND OTHER THINGS BUT HOW HAVE THE UTILITIES BEEN EXERCISING THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND AND HOW HAS THE S. P. D. BEEN TRACKING. WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THOSE? SO I'LL I'LL JUST GIVE A TOP LINE AND AND MINUTE PANDA LEE IF YOU WE NEED TO GO DEEPER IT'S MAY THIRTY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ACTUALLY RECORD. OF FOR GAS POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS IN THE FOR ELECTRIC VIOLATIONS. OF THE GAS VIOLATIONS ONE WAS VOLUNTARY THREE WERE MANDATORY. OF THE ELECTRIC. SEVERAL THEM WE'RE NOT SPECIFIED ONE OF THEM WAS MANDATORY. SO -- WERE WORKING ON A WEBSITE SO THOSE WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. OTHER BIG THERE WE HELPFUL YEAH WE HOPE TO HAVE WE HOPE TO HAVE IT SOON RIGHT IN AND I DON'T THINK WE NEEDED TO GO DOWN ANY FURTHER OKAY YES IT'S OF TIME BUT I DID. IT WELL WHY THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAME TO MIND -- WAS RECENTLY LOOKING AT P. GENIES WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AND AS AN AS PART OF THAT PLAN -- THEY STATED THEY WERE CONDUCTING A THOROUGH SYSTEM WIDE INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF EVERY TRANSMISSION LINE WALKING THE THE LINES CLIMBING TOWERS. IN THE PLAN WAS WAS GOING TO BE FINISHED BY ME USE OF DRUGS YES USE OF DRONES IN THAT THE PLAN WOULD BE -- FINISHED -- WITH THESE INSPECTIONS BY MAY I THINK IS THE TIMELINE THAT THEY GAVE BUT AS PART OF THESE THOROUGH INSPECTIONS. I WAS JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW HOW. DO THEY TRACK WITH THEY FIND IF THEY FIND REPORTED BACK TO THE COMMISSION AND HAVE THEY DONE THAT IS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. IN A TIMELY MANNER. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE -- I BELIEVE THAT -- OUT OF THE THE THE FORTY THOUSAND TOWERS IN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THEY'VE INSPECTED AND AND THAT THOUSAND YOU KNOW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES. THEY FOUND SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES. THEY HAVE REPORTED THAT FIFTY NINE OF THEM ARE SERIOUS THEY'VE CORRECTED ALL OF THOSE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. THAT ACCURATE IS CORRECT IN THE SENATE AND ACID IN A TIMELY MANNER SO OUR ENGINEERS CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEM AS WELL AS SOON ARE COMING IN YOU'RE YOU'RE EVALUATING THEM AND AND LOOK AT THEM AND GUESTS FOLLOWING UP ON THEM AND IN SOME CASES -- IN TWO CASES OF ACTUALLY GOING OUT TO THE SIDES AND LOOKING FOR OURSELVES OKAY THAT'S VERY GOOD THIS THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR AN ENCOURAGING AND SENATOR THE WEBSITE'S UP SO WE WILL SEND YOU THAT LINK GREAT. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THE SECOND ONE IS OF KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT SAME CULTURE THAT -- SENATOR RUBIO WAS MENTIONED YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NORTH STAR. REPORT FROM -- IT IT'S INTERESTING AS LAST YEAR WHEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE MADE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE CULTURE P. JEANNIE STATING THAT IT'S THEIR SAFETY CULTURES LIKE CHECK IN THE BOX IN. WHICH IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND THE OTHER PART WAS I THINGS LIKE WINDOW DRESSING AND I THINK HOW HE WAS DESCRIBED. BUT IT IN THE PHASE -- ONE THE THE RECOMMENDATION. WERE. SOME OF THOSE WERE FOR THE COMMISSION NOT JUST PGN. EIGHT BECAUSE OF THE PHASE ONE DECISION WAS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT. WITH ANY COMMENT ON CHANGES THE COMMISSION MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH TO SELF IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE CHANGES SO HOW'S THE COMMISSION IMPLEMENTED OR LOOK AT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH ARE APPLIED TO THE COMMISSION. I CAN I CAN PROBABLY SPEAK A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY TO THE THE EARLIER YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT REVIEW COMMISSION AND SO WE HAVE MADE STRONG EFFORTS TO REALLY TRY TO BUILD A STRONGER SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. AND I THINK WE'VE MADE PROGRESS I THINK THAT THAT WE STILL ARE UP AGAINST THAT NATURAL LIMITATION DO WE HAVE THIS RATE MAKING AGENCY. THAT THAT DEPENDS ON AUDIT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WITH THAT WAS RECOMMENDED THERE AND I BELIEVE MY IS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY A NOR STAR. IS THAT WE DEVELOP A A TRUE ENFORCEMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH COMMISSIONER REX OFTEN AND OUR GENERAL COUNSEL AND A COUPLE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THE DIVISIONS AND AND SAFE WITH A FORSMAN DIVISION. THE INDUSTRY DIVISIONS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO ACTUALLY GET A TRUE GRADUATED ENFORCEMENT -- PROGRAM WHERE YOU GET IT YOU REPORT OF VIOLATION OR WE FIND A VIOLATION. THEN YOU GET NOTICED THERE WERE TRACKING AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME IF YOU HAVEN'T CORRECTED IT OR AND YOU CAN'T REPORT TO ACHIEVE SOLVE THE PROBLEM. GET A CITATION. YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T SATISFY THROUGH A CITATION NO WAY ENFORCEMENT THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN UNFORTUNATE POLICY. WE DON'T HAVE. CITATION AUTHORITY IN A VARIETY OF AREAS I JUST SAW A FILING FROM THE LARGE ENERGY USERS COALITION SAYING THAT. THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE CITATION AUTHORITIES THAT'S NEWS TO ME TO HAVE IT IN A COUPLE OF AREAS OF ME TO HAVE THE GAP. SO WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY PERFECT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO REALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF AREAS WERE BECOMES A PROBLEM. I THINK ONE AREA IS IN THE AREA OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS WHERE THE ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS OF TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT ON YOUTH. WOULDN'T TOLD PEOPLE USUALLY HAS TO TAKE PLACE THROUGH THE UTILITY ON A CIVIL ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO TOUCH -- VOIP. TECHNOLOGY SO. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO THE QUESTION WILL BE COMING UP AGAIN THIS YEAR ABOUT YOUR AUTHORITY OVER THE P. OVER THOSE ISSUES. MY LAST QUESTION MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. WE WISH THEM A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW DISCUSSING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RULES BOTH IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AND AS A STATE. AND YOU WORK IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WRAPPING UP THE FIRE MAP PROCEEDINGS IN EXTENDING THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CLEARANCES. UNDER THAT RULE MAKING HOWEVER I DIDN'T THE TIME WENT IN LOOKING AT THAT THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS EXCEPTION IN GENERAL RULE. NINETY FIVE NOT SAID EXCEPTIONS THAT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED DECADES AGO. AND WHERE WERE THEY IT WSN'T UPDATED AT ALL DURING THE THE CLEARANCE CHANGES AND AND IF I COULD READ THE EXCEPTION FOR TO RULE. THIRTY FIVE NGO NINETY FIVE IT'S VOTE. THIS IS A MATURE TREES WHOSE TRUNKS AND MAJOR LIMBS ARE LOCATED MORE THAN SIX INCHES BUT LESS THAN THE CLEARANCE REQUIRED. BY TABLE ONE FROM THE PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CONDUCTORS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE MINIMUM CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS RULE THAT BASICALLY SAYS YOU CAN HAVE A SIX INCH CLEARANCE. ON SOME. BRANCHES AND LIMBS NOT THE FOUR FEET THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OR WHATEVER THE THE FOOTAGE WOULD BE IN THAT -- THE TRUNK AND LIMBS TO TO WHICH THE EXEMPTION APPLIES SHOW ONLY BE THOSE OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND RIGIDITY[inaudible] TO PREVENT. THE TRUNK OR LIMB FROM ENCROACHING UPON THE SIX INCH MINIMUM CLEARANCE UNDER REGIONALLY FORESEEABLE LOCAL WIND AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. IT SEEMS TO PREVENT VEGETATION WITHIN SIX INCHES OF A UTILITY LINES SO LONG AS IT'S OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND AND I GUESS IT. I AM I INTERPRETING THE CORRECTLY. HI YES IF YOU ARE INTERNET CORRECTLY AND IT IN WASN'T OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WERE IN COMMUNICATION WITH CAL FIRE AT THIS TIME AND ADDRESSING THAT COLLABORATIVELY BECAUSE SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HOW FAR DOES HALF AS WE GO TO THE SITE SO WE SEE THAT -- FOR QUESTIONING IT OURSELVES AND TAKING A VERY HARD LOOK AT IT WITH CALIFORNIA IS THAT -- IN SO YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SUFFICIENT STRENGTH AND RIGIDITY -- ANSWER THE EXCEPTION IS STILL APPLICABLES MY CONCERN IS WITH THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IS THAT. ALMOST THE WITH A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD BUT IT IS AT A ONE REASON WHY THE FEW SEE IS NOT BEEN TAKING A MORE ACTIVE -- AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTION ON SOME OF THESE FIRES IT WOULDN'T. BECAUSE OF THIS EXCEPTION. I DON'T KNOW IF I'D GO THAT FAR CENTER BUT I WOULD SAY IS AS ROBBINS CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL FIRE. EMILY DEVELOP A WORKING GROUP WANTED TO ADDRESS IT QUICKLY -- SO THAT'S IN LINE WITH THE SB -- NINE ONE I ARE AND THE ACTUAL SIGNING OF THE PLANS THEMSELVES I WOULD SAY AS WELL MANY OF THE TOADIES CONCLUDE P. JEANNIE HAVE INCLUDED IN THEIR PLANS. I'M STANDARDS THAT EXCEED THAT STANDARD WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE CHANGE CONTROL THIRTY FIVE OKAY. THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE I THINK THE POINT IS NOTED MMHM AND YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE ADOPTED -- BECAUSE OF NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS SET BY THE NATIONAL ENERGY REGULATORY -- CORPORATION AND ITS PRECURSORS. PROBABLY JUST DON'T HOLD UP ANYMORE. GOOD POINT VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INDULGING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THREE QUESTIONS OF MINE AS WELL -- ONE ON FIRE FOR A SECOND SINCE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE -- IN TERMS OF OTHER MITIGATION AT RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES OUT THERE I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR TECHNOLOGY SUMMIT COMING UP. GIVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- LACK OF ACCESS TO IT IN SORT OF THIS UPCOMING FIRE SEASON THE ACTUAL SUPPLY OF SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THEIR UTILIZING TO ACTUALLY GET OUT ON THE LINE IN ADDITION TO THE LINE HARDENING IN SOME THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE KNOW FIRE CAMERAS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY BUT I'VE. HEARD THERE'S A ACTUAL SHORTAGE IN THE FIRE CAMERA MARKET AND THAT SOME OF THE I. O. U.'S. HAVE STATE BASIS THAT WE BOUGHT UP AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND THAT'S ALL WE GOT AND WE'RE WE'RE JUST WE'RE WHERE WE ARE SO JUST A BRIEF COMMENT ON ON THAT THE FIRE. I HEARD ABOUT THE FIRE CAMERAS I'VE BEEN FOCUSED A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT THERE'S A LIABILITY RISK. TO SOME OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COMPANIES SO ONE OF THE LARGER OF THE COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY CONTRACT WITH THE UTILITIES. TO TAKE DOWN TREES ON TO MEET THE NEW STANDARDS HIS ACTUALLY BEEN TOLD INTERNALLY BY THEIR RISK MANAGERS THAT IF THERE'S A FIRE. THEY COULD BE LIABLE. AND THAT THEY'RE LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THAT THAT THAT THAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME SHORTAGES IT'S TRUE THAT SOME OF THE UTILITIES ARE REALLY FRONT LOADING THEIR EXPENDITURES. OTHERS ARE BEING A LITTLE MORE MEASURED IN TRYING TO FOCUS ON VERY. SPECIFIC AREAS THAT THEY THINK ARE HIGH HAZARD. AND SO YOU KNOW. I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH. AND I'M BELT AND SUSPENDERS PERSON BUT IT'S PROBABLY. IF YOU HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT YOU CAN PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH ABOUT. N. P. GINNY NOTED AT THE WORKSHOP -- THE FIRST WORKSHOP FOR THAT'S BEEN ON ONE IMPLEMENTATION WITH ACTUAL PERCENT OF THE WATER MITIGATION PLANS THEY DID NOT AS A CONCERN -- IN TERMS OF THE FIRE AND THE CAMERAS AND THE WEATHER STATIONS THAT SO THAT NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED -- BUT THAT WAS NOTED AND AS WELL AS PRESIDENT PICKER SAID ON THE ACTUAL CRUISE A GOING TO THIS VISITATION MANAGEMENT -- IT IT'S REACHED A POINT. AGAIN REPORTED BY SOME THE UTILITIES THAT THEY'VE REACHED A CRITICAL MASS OF THERE'S JUST NO MORE CREWS TO HIRE -- SHOWED. FURTHER RISK MITIGATION TOOL AT LEAST. FOR AGGRESSIVE USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF WHICH I KNOW IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN -- PUTTING FORWARD BUT OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE COMMUNITIES ON THAT FRONT NO ONE WANTS THEIR POWER SHUT OFF -- BUT YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IS NECESSARY BUT% WAYS TO MINIMIZE THAT DOWNSIDE RISK WONDERING HOW YOU GUYS ARE PRIORITIZING -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TO THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE LAST YEAR ON MICRO GRIDS THERE'S ALSO TALK ABOUT BETTER BATTERY BACKUP POWER IT'S SORT OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SAY PUMPING STATIONS FIRE STATIONS. SO I KNOW YOU GOTTA WALK AND CHEW GUM AND FIX A CAR AND RIDE A BIKE AND DO EVERYTHING ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT JUST WONDER WHERE THAT FALLS ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST. IN TERMS OF SORT OF EXPEDITED. THE ACQUISITION YOU KNOW IT ESPECIALLY IN A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES FOR THE FOR THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY -- OF THE LET IT ED RANDOLPH ANSWER THIS YOU DID THAT VERY WELL IN THE ASSEMBLY SO I GUESS SO WELL I MEAN I'M JUST YET NARROWLY ON TO THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE MICRO GRADE BILL -- THERE IS A CHANGE PROPOSAL PENDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON FOR SEVERAL STAFF -- POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THAT THE ANSWER NORMALLY WE WOULD -- LARGELY WAIT UNTIL THE STAFF IN PLACE TO DO THAT HOWEVER GIVEN THE PRIORITY THAT WE HAVE JUGGLED SOME STAFF AROUND. ON TO START DOING THE WORK ON THAT BILL ON WELL AHEAD OF TIME ANTICIPATING. THAT AS THE COMMISSION DEVELOPS -- MORE PROTOCOLS AROUND SHUT OFFS ON THAT ISSUES LIKE MICROGRAMS AND BEHIND THE METER STORAGE CAUSE FOR SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD ASK -- THE THE PRECEDING THAT'S UNDER WAY -- UNDER SB THREE EIGHTY TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY A CLOSURE WHICH THIS GOVERNOR ALREADY COMMITTED TO DURING HIS CAMPAIGN BUT THAT. THE THAT THAT ASSESSMENT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON ASSUMPTION OF BUSINESS AS USUAL UNDER UNDER PREVIOUS LAW IN OTHER WORDS. THERE'S NO ANTICIPATION OF THE W. P. -- SHUDDERING. EVENTUALLY CLOSING DOWN THEIR GAS PLANTS THERE'S NO ASSUMPTION OF SB ONE HUNDRED PASSING THERE'S NO ASSUMPTION OF A HUGE MARKET PENETRATION UNDER SB FORTY SEVEN SEVEN AND ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SO. ARE HAVE WE SORT OF ALREADY RIGGED THAT PROCEEDING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION OR IS IT ALREADY IS A P. C. STILL OPEN MINDED ABOUT. THE FUTURE OF SORT OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS ABILITY TO TO MEET SOME OF THE GAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EVEN ASSUMING ANDREA FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OR THREE EIGHTY I'M SAYING THE THREE EIGHTY PROCEEDING LOOKING THE FEASIBILITY OF CLOSURE DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NEW ADVANCES IN BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. NEW ADVANCE AN ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS AS WELL AS SB ONE HUNDRED AND AND GAS -- PLANT CLOSURE I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BOY THOSE BECAUSE WE DON'T CONTROL THE BUILDING STANDARDS AND I WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT AND THE IN A I'M FROM VERY OPTIMISTIC I JUST DON'T SEE THE WILLINGNESS THERE TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY IT. SO AGAIN BELTS AND SUSPENDERS. RIGHT BUT I'M ASKING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF THE SB THREE PRECEDING. IN IN IN I. UNDER MY RELATING ASSUMPTION FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IS LA COUNTY WILL PERFORM. SOME ESTIMATE THREE I DON'T I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT THE COULD ASSIGN COMMISSION ON THAT ANY ANSWER THAT BUT I WILL SAY I'M VERY FEARFUL THAT IF WE BUILD THOSE EXEMPTIONS AND BASED ON WHAT I'M SEEING AROUND THEIR RESPONSE AND FOR ONLY. SEVENTY SEVEN AGREED AND YOU CAN WILL DO ANY SIX THOUSAND NEW UNITS AND ON YOUR GAS IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT ELECT I AM SO. IT SENATOR ON THE THREE EIGHTY PROCEEDING WHICH BECAUSE OF THAT'S A COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH'S PROCEEDING AND BECAUSE OF BAGLEY KEENE ROLES HARD FOR IT COMMISSIONERS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRECEDING DETAILS. ON HI I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT IN WHAT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE IN THE INITIAL ROUND OF MODELING -- BUT WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME COMMUNICATING WHAT WE INTEND IS THE NEXT STEP. I'M IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE MODELING IS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS -- NOW IN WATER THE CONSTRAINTS THERE ON THE NEXT ROUND IS THEN WHERE YOU CAN GO IN AND SAY OKAY WHAT HAPPENS IF WE OUT A WHOLE LOT OF CONSERVATION -- WHAT HAPPENS WE DRAMATICALLY GAS DEMAND AT THE PEAK PERIODS WHAT HAPPENS IF -- YOU CLOSE DOWN THE FIELD AND INSTEAD INSTALL MUCH MORE PIPELINE CAPACITY BOTH SO YOU CAN GET MORE IN THE STATE IN A LOT OF REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY USE PIPELINES AS A STORAGE MEDIA. I'M SO THAT'S JUST NOT THIS ROUND -- YOU KNOW IT'S ANOTHER ONE THESE PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT STORY TO TELL ON OUR TIMING -- OTHER THAN THIS IS THIS TYPE OF MODELING ON THE GAS SYSTEM IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE EXPERTISE ON AND I THINK IT IS AS YOU'RE AWARE -- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE EXPERTISE ON IT OTHER THAN THE UTILITY SO WE REALLY STRUGGLED IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS ON HOW TO DO SOME OF THIS MODELING. ON IN A WAY THAT THECOMMUNITY HAD CONFIDENCE. THAT. IT WAS GOING TO BE IT WASN'T GOING TO BE A BIASED MODEL BECAUSE SO CAL GAS. IS THE ONE WHO OWNS THE MODELING SOFTWARE I THINK WE'VE WORKED OUT NOW -- BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTRACTING PROBLEMS -- IN WORKING WITH -- SOME GOOD NEWS ONLINE TO THIRTY FIVE IS THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION I HAVE NOW IS AFTER -- FIFTEEN FORSMAN DIVISION AND COMMISSIONER RAND OFF. PUT CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THEM WERE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT THOSE REPAIRS WILL BE DONE -- WELL BEFORE THIS SUMMER SO IT THE H. TWO THIRTY FIVE ITSELF SHOULDN'T HAVE IMPACTS ON THIS SUMMER THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM STILL BUT TO THIRTY FIVE WILL SHOULD BE RESOLVED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER BAKER FOR YOUR REPORT IT'S VERY BIG. VERY DETAILED AND SO CAN I ASK. OKAY WELL LET ME AS THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ON SOME SPECIFIC PAGES -- PAGE. SIXTY TWO UNDER UTILITY SAFETY -- THERE IS UNDER GROUNDING WITH THE THE CPUC INITIATED. TO EVALUATE RULE TWENTY A AND I'M JUST. TO GET UP TO SPEED ON RULE TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE I HAVE. IT IS MY DISTRICT THAT WOULD LOVE TO UNDERGROUND AND FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO THAT FUNDING SO MAYBE YOU CAN KIND OF GIVE ME SO CITIES IN YOUR DISTRICT PROBABLY DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDING BUT THIS IS A BEAUTIFICATION FUND. THIS IS NOT A SAFETY FUND THIS WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE BEAUTIFICATION OF DOWNTOWN'S BY ALLOWING -- TO UNDER GROUNDING THERE. BECAUSE OF THE DENSITIES. SO YOU'RE SERVING A LOT OF CUSTOMERS SO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THAT EVERY YEAR. COMMUNITIES GET A CREDIT. AND YOU CAN ACCUMULATE THE CREDITS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN PAY FOR YOUR SHARE. OF THE UNDER GROUNDING IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEN YOU CAT YOU'VE PUT YOUR MONEY UP YOU CASH IN THE CREDITS IN UTILITY WILL WORK WITH YOU TO ACTUALLY DO THE UNDER GROUNDING. IT'S A CHALLENGES WELL FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THIS BECAUSE HE CAN'T JUST DO. FOR BEAUTIFICATION. THE ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE TO GET THE TELCOS TO PARTICIPATE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY OVER THEM AND NOR THERE DO WE IN THE SAME WAY WE HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE THEIR TELCO SO. SOME PEOPLE WILL ACCUMULATE THEIR CREDITS AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY SALAM TO OTHER CITIES SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY A MASS THE CREDITS MORE QUICKLY TO DO THEIR PROJECTS. BUT GENERALLY THESE ARE TO THE LAW WAS PASSED FOR BEAUTIFICATION PURPOSES. AND IT TENDS TO WORK BEST IN PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE REAL DENSE POPULATIONS LIKE DOWNTOWN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WHAT WITH THE PROGRAM LOOK LIKE IF IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE AIMED AT SAFETY. THEN HOW CAN I HELP YOU DO THAT. AT ONE TWENTY BEASON SEES ACT GO ON THE WERE EACH TRYING TO GET TO SO I THINK I I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU MORE THOUGHTFUL ANSWER THAT I CAN GIVE YOU HERE -- I THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME OTHER -- AREAS IF WE EXPLORE WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON BUT THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY HIGH. AND SO ON THE QUESTION WILL BE SHOULD THEY BE SOCIALIZED THROUGHOUT THE RATE BASE. SO SHOULD YOU OF ON A THE LOW INCOME COMMITTEES PAY FOR HIGHER INCOME COMMUNITIES HOW WILL WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS FAIR CROSS THE THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE OF A PARTICULAR UTILITY. SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP MORE AND MORE AND MORE THAT WE DID USED TO HEAR ABOUT. BUT I WANNA I WANNA ACTUALLY GIVE YOU MORE THOUGHTFUL ANSWERS AND IT WOULD GIVE YOU HERE. YEAH I I MET WITH THE ANAHEIM. UTILITY WHICH IS A CITY UTILITY FOR ELECTRICITY AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN METHODICALLY. UNDER GROUNDING IN THEIR WILD FIRES AND SO THEY'VE GOT ABOUT TAKING CARE OF ANY ARE DOING BEAUTIFICATION INSIDE. YOU KNOW THE CITY. CELLS HAVE JUST I'M LOOKING AT THIS IS AS A SAFETY OPPORTUNITY. SO THANK YOU. LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DISCUSSION ON PAGE -- TWELVE YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON SELECT TREES OF THE LECTURE UTILITY DISTRIBUTION POLLS REPRESENT BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. IN THE PHOTO YOU HAVE THEIR HUNDRED PAGES SORT OF LIKE. WHAT I HAVE IN LAGUNA CANYON ROAD? WERE FIFTY NINE OF THESE POLLS HAVE BEEN HIT BY CARS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND KNOCKED OVER BECAUSE THERE WOULD NAY SNAPPING. MANY BLOCKED ONE OF THE THREE ENTRIES INTO. THE CITY FOR LIKE ALL DAY. TRY TO BE PATIENT WITH YOUR DRIVER'S YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S COYOTES CUT THEM OFF FOR DEER OR TEXTING ARE YOU KNOW DO YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT BUT WHEN THOSE POLLS ARE THAT CLOSE TO THE ROAD AND YOU'RE SWERVING OR WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU FALSELY -- IT'S JUST BEEN A REAL MESS BUT I WAS I WAS HAVING TROUBLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THOSE TWO PARAGRAPHS FOR TRYING TO COMMUNICATE? WELL SO AS WE LOOK AT THE THE VAST LANDSCAPE OF POLLS THEY PRESENT AN ENORMOUS CUSTOMER VALUE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY LIKE TO THINK ABOUT. BUT THE KERRY AT THE TOP AND YOU CAN SEE THAT AND IN THIS PICTURE -- THE THE THREE PHASE ALTERNATING CURRENT. DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER. THAT IS THE THAT IS WHAT DRIVES THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS IS THEIR ABILITY TO FIND ACCESS TO THIS NETWORK OF POLLS A CONNECTS EVERY HOME EVERY BUSINESS EVERY COMMUNITY. AND SO -- HOW DO WE ACTUALLY TWO OF VALUE POLLS WELL HOW DO WE ACTUALLY START -- TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR ACCESS TO THIS NETWORK HOW DO WE ACTUALLY USE THAT TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE OVERALL SAFETY AND RELIABILITY -- HERE EVERYBODY SAVE MONEY BECAUSE HE PUT IT CLOSE TO THE ROAD WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT COULD BE NOW THE ROAD PROBABLY GREW IN SIZE FROM MAYBE A DIRT TRACK TO A PAVED HIGHWAY AND THEN -- TO PAVED ROAD TWO LANE ROAD AND THEN A PAVED WITH THE WITH THE LITTLE BIT OF A A MARGIN SO. THE YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE EVEN FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR PARTICIPATION TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT NETWORK HOW DO WE TURN THAT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. THIS IS GOING TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE IN THIS IS THIS IS A DIET STRESS THIS FOR PEOPLE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS FIVE G.. EVERYBODY WANTS MORE ROBUST. MOBILE BROADBAND THAT'S FIVE G. AS A BROADCAST TECHNOLOGY WHAT IS IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BROADCAST. THE NEEDS ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY. IT NEEDS ACCESS TO FIBER IN NEEDS TO BE ABOUT EVERY THREE HUNDRED FEET. AND IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE AIR. SO WE UNDERGROUND ALL THIS THERE MAY BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PUSHING THEIR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BECAUSE IS NOT GETTING DIRECTION. SO I THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY. AND SO WOULD POLLS ARE STILL. YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO OWN ONE THERE'S NOT A COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE AND IT IS THE NATURAL MONOPOLY. BUT HE BRINGS VALUE TO PEOPLE. THEN ON A PAGE ELEVEN THE CHAIRS ARE READY. KIND OF HAMMER ON THIS A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S ON YOUR RATE CASES AND SO. YOU KNOW THE SENATOR I GET TO HEAR STORIES OF THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS -- WE'RE STARTING OUR NEXT RATE INCREASE REQUEST AND WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE OLD ONE AND I'M. A GUY YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE SO I'M ASKING KIND OF BASIC QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON. FOR SO USE BE PRETTY SIMPLE THE UTILITIES BASICALLY ARE ARE EITHER BY OUR LIKELY PHONE COMPANIES AND ALL BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SUCH A BROAD JURISDICTION ALL OF THEM HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE COMPLICATED OVER TIME BECAUSE THE THE SENSUAL NATURE OF OF WHAT THEY DO SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE WATER COMPANIES. NOW ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH I HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- MORE DEPENDENCE ON GROUND WATER IN SOME PLACES WERE BUYING WATER IAN COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND SO THEY BECOME MORE COMPLICATED ENTITIES IT TAKES MORE TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THE MONEY THEY REALLY NEED IS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY NEED. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON SHARING THE COSTS EQUALLY WITH DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. YOU HAVE WATER COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE BECOME NOT JUST A LOCAL WATER COMPANY BUT THEY OWN. DISK CONTIGUOUS. WATER COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE PROVIDE YOU UNIFIED RATE CASE. SO THEWORLD'S BECOME MUCH MORE CLUTTERING IN AND DIFFICULT FORCE EVEN THERE. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PLACES WORRY WE JUST NEED TO REALLY GET BAD RIGHT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THE SMALL REGULATED -- OF PHONE COMPANIES. CAN YOU STILL TAKE A LONG TIME. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME DEGREE OF OF OF ON PROCEDURAL ATTENTION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A JUDGE YOU HAVE TO HAVE HEARINGS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PARTY SUBMITTED YOU HAVE TO HAVE. EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS ON THEIR BOOKS AND IF THEY HAVE OF SETTLEMENTS IN CASE THERE'S DISAGREEMENTS FOR YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FINAL DECISION. IT GOES OUT FOR COMMENT SO SOME OF IT IS GOING TO TAKE THE TIME IT TAKES NO MATTER WHAT. OTHER PLACES IS JUST BECOME PHENOMENALLY MORE COMPLICATED I'LL SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE DEAL WITH THE TO SEE YOU SEE HAS GROWN OVER TIME. SO -- IN A IN A WORLD WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A HUNDRED CASES WE NOW HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. WE ONLY HAVE FORTY JUDGES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BECOME A BOTTLENECK. IS THERE A WAY TO STREAMLINE IT LIKE -- OF LIKE AN INFLATION FACTOR. SO WHAT DOES THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE ACCURATE FOR YEARS AND SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR I MEAN HOW DOES I GET REIMBURSED FOR THE FOR THE THE FOUR YEARS IS REALLY THE BIG COMPANIES THE REALLY BIG ENERGY UTILITIES IS USUALLY NOT THE SMALLER ONES -- AGAIN I I YOU KNOW I THINK WE CAN TRIAL THOSE THINGS BUT IT DOES OPEN SELF UP. TO GAMING IN SOME CASES IT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC WANTS. THE AMOUNT OF ANGST AND ATTENTION THAT WE GET FROM CUSTOMERS OF SMALL WATER COMPANIES. IS JUST AS BIG AS SOME OF THE LARGE ELECTRIC UTILITIES. AND SO INTO IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THAT DEMOCRATIC OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO CHALLENGE THESE MONOPOLIES. WE HAVE TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. FOUR YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE EVERYTHING. WHEN A DEMOCRAT EITHER? WELL I I RESERVE OR MAYES MISTER PICKER WITH THE WITH THE WHITE THAN BREATH OF EVERYTHING THAT THE CPUC DOES THIS WAS VERY EDUCATIONAL I APPRECIATED. I A DO YOU HAVE AN ORG CHART ON YOUR WAY. ALSO SEND YOU ONE OF THE BIG GREATER. I WOULD LOVE AN ORCHARD IS A AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS. I WAS I WAS WONDERING. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST TOO BIG I MEAN IF YOU COULD FOCUS JUST ON A NARROWER. AREA YOU CAN GET THINGS VERY DONE A LITTLE FASTER. WE CAN DROP IT UP INTO WE'VE SUGGESTED THAT IN THE PAST AND WE WE TEND TO RUN UP AGAINST -- CONSTITUTIONAL DEFINITION SUTTER CHALLENGES WAS STATUTORY DEFINITIONS SO THERE'S IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT IT I THINK WE WOULD AGREE THAT A LEANER ORGANIZATIONS SMALLER. SCOPE OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH MIGHT BE HELPFUL. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TIME TAKE MEASURE RIGHT. THANK YOU -- PRESENT IN YOUR PRISON TATIAN YOU MENTIONED -- JUNIOR ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED BY MISS MORE NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND APPRECIATE THE UPTICK IN SPENDING BUT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT MINORITY BUSINESSES ARE NOT REALLY GROWING IT'S NOT A GREATER POOL OF MINORITY BILL WHAT SEEN. THIS MANY TIMES WHAT WAS A MALE OWNED BUSINESS NOW IN IT THE WIFE OF THE DAUGHTERS NAME. BUT MY REAL QUESTION IS SOME OF THE STATE PROGRAMS IN MANDATE. HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT WHETHER INTENTIONALLY OR NOT. ON DIVERSE SPENDING [inaudible] SO. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES OWNED ALL OF THE GENERATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE OF IN IN IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY SIX RELIEVE THEM OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY. SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD POWER PLANTS ARE NOT REGULATED DIRECTLY WE SIMPLY SEE THE CONTRACT. AND SO IS YOU START TO SEE MORE AND MORE DIFFERENT. BUSINESS MODELS FOR HOW PEOPLE GET THEIR ELECTRICITY. THEN SOME OF THAT SPENDING THEN MIGRATES AWAY FROM THE UTILITIES -- NET ENERGY MADE ROOFING FOR EXAMPLE THOSE CONTRACTORS. WHO DO THAT AND THE COMPANIES WHO PAY THEM ARE NOT SUBJECT? TO THE VOLUNTARY PROVISIONS OF OF GEO. ONE FIFTY SIX GENERAL ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN MEETING WITH THEM A NUMBER OF TIMES TO TRY TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE AND TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM IN TERMS OF BRINGING PROSPERITY STOOD A DIFFERENT. ON A COMMUNITIES. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE THAT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO THINGS HIS BAND. PARTIAL SOMETIMES OF COME FOR WITH PROJECTS BUT YOU DON'T SEE THAT AS A STANDARD BUSINESS PRACTICE. IN THE WAY THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE DONE AND I THINK THE UTILITIES HAVE TRIED HARD. TO KEEP PACE WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE YOU DESCRIBE. YOU KNOW THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING CONTRACTORS WHO ARE DIVERSE BUSINESS FIRMS TO ACTUALLY DEVELOPING PROGRAMS FOR THOSE FIRMS TO THEMSELVES HAVE DIVERSE SUBCONTRACTORS. AND THAT'S A VERY HEALTHY THING CAUSES X. THE COMPANY GETS ESTABLISHED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THEN THEY ARE GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND HELP THEM ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK IN A SUB CURRENT TRACK TO THE UTILITY. MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LONGER PERIOD SOMETIMES BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAID BACK YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ON A WILLING BANKER WHO'S WILLING TO UNDERSTAND. THE YOU WILL GET PAID BUT TIME LINES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WOULD BE IF YOU ARE IN SMALL BUSINESS ONLY SERVING PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. SO YOU JUST NOT SEEING THAT FOR THESE NEW PARTIES AND I THINK THAT THAT THE THAT I CONTINUETO TO THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO INSPIRE THEM TO THE GREATNESS. THE THE OTHER OF PROVIDERS HAVE. ARM WAS STICKING TO THE UTILITIES AREA THAT THEY DO HAVE DIRECT. IMPACT ON RIGHT NOW IN THE AREA THAT WE BOUGHT TOUCH TOUCH UPON HIS LINE CLEARING. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MINORITY FIRM BEING USED FOR VEGETATION CLEARING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY DO EXIST SEOUL WHY NOT THERE SHINING A LIGHT THERE THE ENCOURAGED THAT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE NEED OF LINE CLEARING HELP. ABATE THESE FIRES BUT YOU'RE NOT USING ANY MINORITY CONTRACTORS TO DO SUCH OKAY THAT'S GOOD POINT THANK YOU FOR FOR LETTING US KNOW WILL FOLLOW UP ON IT. AND MY SECOND ONE IS -- I MEAN THIRD ISSUE ARCHDIOCESAN I WANT TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW HAVE MINIMUM REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER CCA'S THEY'RE NOT HEARING A ONE FIFTY SIX WE'RE NOT HEARING TO ANY OTHER THING SO -- IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO GIVE THEM MORE RESPONSIBILITY BUT LESS OVERSIGHT. NO -- IN I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH THEM SEVERAL TIMES AND AGAIN THEY THEY WHAT THEY VIEW IS THEIR JOB IS TO DO. SMALL EMPLOYMENT. THEY DON'T EMPLOYEE BY THE NO THEY DO AROUND THEIR CONTRACTORS TO BUILD THESE SMALL PROJECTS THE DOING THEIR DISTRICT. THEY DON'T DO THAT ON SOME THEIR LARGER CONTRACTS BUT THEY THEMSELVES DON'T DON'T HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS SO USUALLY IT'S A SMALL. PROJECT IN ITS CONSTRUCTION WORK IN AT THE END OF THAT PROJECT THEN OF COURSE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO INTO THE CONSTRUCTION WILL. WHICH IS ALWAYS CYCLICAL TO BEGIN WITH PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO I HAVE I HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THAT'S REALLY. AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY THINK IT IS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM DO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO EVEN REQUIRE THEM TO CONSIDER. GEO ONE FIFTIES OKAY BUT SHOULD THEY HAVE BACK TO OVERSIGHT SHOULDN'T YOU GUYS HAVE GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER. A ENTITY AYE AYE LET ME TELL YOU ONLY REASON I ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M OFFER COMPETITION. BUT I WORK FOR A MAJOR UTILITY TURN ENERGY CRISIS AND I DON'T SEECCA'S ANY DIFFERENT FROM ENRON THEIR THIRD PARK PARTY REMARKETER OF POWER. AND WHEN YOU SAY ONE OF THEM GO CREDIT SHE LINE OF CREDIT -- AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE YEAR INCUMBENT UTILITY. AND IF I STOP BUYING POWER FOR THAT COM OUR CUSTOMER AND NOW MY CCA GOES BACK GROW WHAT WE OUT WE BOUGHT IT WE HAVE UTILITY BUYING POWER ONCE AGAIN ON THE SPOT MARKET. YOU KNOW TO SERVE THAT CUSTOMER. CHAU I WOULD I'M JUST GONNA QUICKLY -- POINT TO THESE TWO STUDIES DEAD ONE WAS THAT SORRY. RUN REPORT ONE WAS -- WAS -- RUN REPORT. BUT HERE IT IS -- SOMEPLACE HERE. WE DID TWO STUDIES ONE WAS AN EXAMINATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ELECTRICITY MARKETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE THIRD PARTY START TO PROVIDE MORE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. THERE'S TECHNOLOGIES AND THERE'S BUSINESS MODELS IS DIRECT ACCESS IS. THE PACE -- ANA LENDERS IT'S THE IT'S THE THE THE THE COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY AGGREGATOR THE NET ENERGY METERED ROOFTOP SOLAR AND TO SOME EXTENT THE THE FUEL CELL THE NATURAL GAS FUEL SO COMPANIES. ALL HAVE ALLOWED OF VARIOUS CUSTOMERS TO DEPART FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES IS WILL PLACE FOR THE BUY THEIR ELECTRICITY -- I WE LOOKED AT FOR STATE THERE HAVE ACTUALLY. THIRD OF GOING DOWN THIS PATH. AND WHAT BECOMES CLEAR IS WERE SORT OF BETWEEN. THE THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITY AND A FULLY DEREGULATED ELECTRICITY MARKET SO WE'RE KIND OF ON CHARTED AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY. YOU POINTED TO SOME OF IT -- THIS IS OUR SECOND REPORT AND BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THOSE OTHER FOUR STATES IT'S SUGGESTS A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO TO ACTUALLY PROTECT AGAINST SOME OF THE THE DANGERS AND THE SUN CHARTED TERRITORY. WE DID DISCUSS THE THERE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO USE. YOUR INVESTMENTS IN YOUR CONTRACTORS IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTED ALL OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AS WELL THAT DIVERSITY CONTRACT THERE'S PROGRAM SO. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT I KNOW THAT -- THEY COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IS PLANNING ANOTHER HEARING SOLELY ON THAT SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT MY LAST QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE THE TO CC AGE TO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. PALMER USE RULES THIS IS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I DON'T STRUCTURE THEY TEND TO THINK PRIMARILY ABOUT -- CLEAN ENERGY THE CCA IS THE CLEAN THE COMBATIVE COMMITTEE AGGREGATORS ORIGINALLY WERE FORMED TO ACTUALLY GET CHEAPER PRICES. BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT SORT OF BEEN LOST IN A IN A RACE TO BE AS GREEN AS YOU CAN BE SO I THINK THAT THE THE THE THE GAMES A CHANGE. I THINK THAT MOST OF THEM WHEN THEY DO LEARN ABOUT TIME OF USE OF JUST KIND OF DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD WHAT THEY WOULD STICK WITH THE UTILITY. OF RATES BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO THAT WE COULD FIND SOME OF THEM DECIDE NOT [inaudible] TO THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE REFERENCES THAT EARLIER ON WHERE THE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED AROUND -- MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATE RUBIO REFERENCING THE NINETEEN PROGRAMS -- IT AROUND THE SAFETY ALL OF BROADLY SAY SAFETY CULTURE. THEN WE HAVE THE NORTH STAR -- ART THAT YOU REFERENCE TO REPORT THE REFERENCE. SO IS LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND SCRIPT BY UNDERSTAND CORRECT WHAT I'VE INTERPRETING IS THAT. THE PC IS. WORKING NOW TO TRY TO GET MORE. MORE. US A CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY AROUND. THESE KIND OF SAFETY RULES SO THAT THEY CAN BE. IN FORCED MORE AT SO IT'S EASIER TO DO THE ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T TO ENFORCEMENT OVER THEIR SAFETY PROGRAMS PER SE WHAT WE DO IS ENFORCE FAILURES. TO ACTUALLY BE SAFE OKAY SO BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE AND A THE ORIGINAL -- INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. OF EXTERNAL -- OF THIRTIES WHO LOOKED AT ASSN P. GINNY SUGGESTED THAT WE START TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES RIGHT. THE PLACE WERE REALLY -- PROBABLY SHOWS UP MOST IS AS WITH WE UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT ELEMENTS GO INTO THEIR SAFETY CULTURE. WE'LL SEE THAT IN THEIR RISK THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD ACTUALLY REVIEWED DESIST MAKES SENSE AS AN EXPENDITURE RIGHT. AND SO AGAIN IT'S HARD TO KNOW SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO SEE THINGS PLAY OUT OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS TO SEE IF IT ACTUALLY RESULT IN LESS. LEADING INDICATORS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE DENNIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST ONE BUT WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. THEY ACTUALLY COUNT NEAR MISSES IN THE PARKING LOT. BECAUSE THAT TELLS THEM WHO IS REALLY. DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT HER PEOPLE WERE DRIVING ONE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT TRUCKS TO DO. THAT TELLS THEM THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL THEY HAVE OTHER KIND OF LEADING INDICATORS THAT THEY LOOK AT IN THE FIELD. SO DID YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SIMPLE THINGS THAT TELL YOU WHETHER PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PRACTICING GOOD SAFETY. THEN YOU MEASURE THE LAGGING INDICATORS WAS ARE MORE CRAP AND FAILURE WITH THEIR MORE COLLISIONS DID YOU HAVE MORE ACCIDENTS ON THE ROAD. SO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BALANCE OF THOSE KINDS OF METRICS TO REALLY SEE HOW WELL THINGS WORK. AND EVEN THEN YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RIGHT SET OF METRICS TO REALLY GET ON A DEAL WITH THE HIGH CONSEQUENCE BUT LOWER CURRENTS. KINDS OF INITIATIVES BUT YOU WANT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO START THERE SO THE EXAMPLE THAT I USE WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT ITSELF CO. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY IMPROVED THEIR OVERALL PROFITABILITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO FOCUSED ON SAFETY WITHIN THE AREA? THAT THEY STARTED TO ACTUALLY NOTICE THINGS AND REPORTED BACK UP THE CHAIN. THERE ENDED UP IN SAVINGS BOTH IN TERMS OF INSURANCE COSTS AND LOST TIME BUT ALSO PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. AND SO YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY YOU DO THINGS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN THEN PICK IT APART AND SEE WHERE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. SO THE GET EVEN BETTER AND BETTER SAY AND A RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY OUR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CONCEPT RATHER THAN COMPLIANCE WHICH IS STEADY STATE TO DO THIS AND THEN YOU SHOULD BE OKAY. I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE COM. PLEX CITY OF IT BUT I AM I'M JUST THINKING SAY ON THE WILDFIRE PART AND I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. THAT WE DON'T ENFORCE. THAT YOU DO A TAX OR WHY WE MOURN FORCE THAT YOU THAT WHATEVER PROCEDURES YOU'RE USING THAT YOU HAVE. MINIMIZE THESE RISKS -- HOWEVER. AS YOU POINTED OUT SINCE. SINCE THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CHARGE TO RATE PAYERS -- AND AND I'M PARTLY THINKING ABOUT THE JUDGE RIGHT NOW WHO'S BASICALLY LOOKING AT SB OPINING THAT P. GENIES -- BOTH ATTENTION TO A DEDICATION TO AND NOT ONLY THOROUGHNESS BUT REALLY JUST -- ACTIVITY IN RELATIONSHIP TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO THIS JUDGE AT LEAST IN THE OLD -- PINING THAT I'VE READ IT READ IN THE PRESS REPORTS YOU KNOW IS IN HIS OPINION VERY BAD. AND SO HE'S NOW ORDERING CERTAIN THINGS WHICH OF COURSE. WOULD IT SEEMS TO ME HARVARD THEN END UP BEING THINGS THAT REPAIRS WOULD HAVE TO BE CHARGED. TO SO I'M WHAT I'M STARTING WITH AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL AT THIS NOW BUT THAT WITHOUT. A CLEAR PROTOCOL FOR WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP INSURE GOOD. SAFETY IN RELATIONSHIP TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION THEN HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN. JUSTIFY THEIR EXPENDITURE AND I REASON AGAIN MAYBE NOT THE BEST ANALOGY BUT I THINK ABOUT. WHAT HOSPITALS HAVE PUT INTO PLACE NOW SAVE WITH SURGERIES OR WHAT THEY DON'T CARE WHAT THE SURGERY IS EVERYONE ELSETO FOLLOW A VERY SIMILAR PROTOCOL? WHICH HELPS IN WHICH THEY HAVE TESTED OVER TIME THAT MINIMIZES MISTAKES IN THE SURGERY REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF SURGERY AND SO. I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT WHEN NONE OF US ACTUALLY OUR WORK ON LINE CREWS. NONE OF US ACTUALLY MOVE MANAGE LYING CRUZ EITHER GAS INSPECTION OR OR ELECTRIC. IT THE DOWN TO THOSE BEST PRACTICE MODELS RATE AND THIS IS THIS IS NW TO US IS IT IS IN MANY OTHER PLACES WE STUDIED A VARIETY OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MODELS. AND AGAIN I POINTED TO THE INFO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF THE FAA WERE THE THE THE THE ONLY CRIME AT THE FCA IS FAILURE TO REPORT. AN INCIDENT. THEN THEY ARE ALL EVERYBODY STOPS TO TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. AND THAT'S THE WHOLE ARGUMENT AROUND WHETHER THEY SHOULD GROUND THE FLEET OF SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN SO -- BUT WILL NORTH STAR. POTENTIALLY PROVIDE I MEAN NOT THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE AN ANSWER BUT MIGHT THEY PROVIDE SOME. GUIDANCE NINE YEAR SORT OF ASKING ME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO HER DIRECT WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE IN MY POCKET OKAY ALL RIGHT. HI ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TOOLS OUT THERE WERE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THEM. WE WANT TO HAVE BEST PRACTICES BE JUST CAN'T GET HIM OFF THE SHELF. SO THE LAST QUESTIONS GIVE MAKERS COMPLETELY NOT ON THE FIRE -- YOU REFERENCE THE AD CARBONIZATION OF BUILDINGS AND WE'RE HOPING THAT OTHER KICK OTHER COMMUNITY SO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF BERKELEY. OKAY. BUT I THINK CERTAINLY GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW WE'RE APT WERE OBVIOUSLY ACCELERATING. OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND D. CARBONIZED ECONOMY AND CLEARLY DE CARBON ICING BUILDINGS IS AN ASPECT OF IT AND WHAT. WE'D WANT TO DO IT WISELY OF COURSE BUT YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD. TO THANK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ALL YOUR ALL THE INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH US WE'RE GONNA MOVE ONTO THEIR FOR THE PUBLIC AT ADVOCATES OFFICE -- ELIZABETH ECKELS [inaudible] COME FORWARD OKAY [inaudible] YEAH WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. I WANT TO FIRST INTRODUCE MY DEPUTY FOR ENERGY LINDA SERIZAWA ON MY RIGHT AS WELL AS MY CHIEF COUNSEL DARWIN FOR OUR AND WE ALL APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT. HE ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS SOME OF THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT THAT ARE BEFORE US. TODAY. OF COURSE WELL ACTUALLY BEFORE I STARTED IS WHEN A CHECK TO MAKE SURE AND NO MORE. CPC DECISION MAKERS ARE IN THE ROOM. OKAY BECAUSE OTHERWISE I HAVE TO READ A STATEMENT FROM OUR ATTORNEY REGARDING EX PARTE. BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HERE OKAY. SO -- AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE AT THE P. YOU SEE AND OUR MISSION IS TO ACHIEVE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES FOR CUSTOMERS CONSISTENT WITH SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE. OUR GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE REGULATED INDUSTRY. ENERGY WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. WE ALSO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND AND THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES. WE PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS BY ALSO WORKING TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE WORK HARD TO PROVIDE INPUT ON UTILITY PROGRAMS ACROSS INDUSTRY AREAS THAT REDUCE THEIR SAFETY RISKS AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS. I WANT TO START BY SAYING. HOW IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE IN THIS CURRENT STATE WITH THE WILD FIRES AND THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY? HOW OUR TOP PRIORITY IS TO WORK WITH YOU THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE PC? AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT ARE SAFE. GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE VICTIMS OF THE TRAGIC WILDFIRES THAT OUR STATE HAS EXPERIENCED. AND WE ALSO MUST ADDRESS CUSTOMERS VERY REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT [inaudible] SIMPLY PUT. ESTAMOS MUST KNOW THAT THE LIGHTS WILL STAY ON THEIR UTILITY SYSTEMS MUST BE MADE SAFE AND RELIABLE AND THAT CUSTOMERS CAN'T. FOOT THE BILL FOR ANY POTENTIAL UTILITY MISDEEDS. AS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE MUST PUT THE INTERESTS OF VICTIMS CUSTOMERS AND RANK AND FILE P. JEANNIE EMPLOYEES FIRST. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HONOR THOSE WHO SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE FIRES. IS TO TAKE REAL STEPS TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. AND AT THE SAME TIME CUSTOMERS SHOULDN'T. AND CAN'T CONTINUE TO PAY AND PAY AND PAY. THE COMMISSION'S RECENTLY OPENED PROCEEDING THE END DISCONNECTION ARE ASKING MANY OF THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT. BUT ABOUT CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY THAT. ARE GOING TO COME UP IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. WITH TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS A VOICE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. WE ARE OF COURSE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE P. YOU SEE RELATED PROCEED THE THE P. JEANNIE RELATED. PROCEEDINGS AT THE P. C.. AND IN ADDITION WE HAVE JOINED WITH TURN A AND P. AND OTHERS TO ASK THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RATE PAYERS COMMITTEE AND WE ALSO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN ESTABLISHING A REPAIR COMMITTEE SO THAT THE VOICES OF CONSUMERS CAN BE HEARD IN THIS PROCESS. NOW I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS FROM FROM LAST YEAR I YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE COPIES OF BOTH OUR ANNUAL REPORT. AS WELL AS THE THE SLIDES GREAT SO VERY QUICKLY -- FIRST OF ALL. LAST YEAR THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SAVED CONSUMERS OVER THREE POINT THREE BILLION AND REDUCED RATES OF WHAT IT COSTS AND CUSTOMER REFUNDS AT THAT'S COMPARED WITH WHAT THE UTILITIES REQUESTED. THAT PAGE THREE OF THE THE SLIDE AND WANT TO REFER YOU -- TO OUR DEDICATED TEAM OF ANALYSTS ENGINEERS AND AUDITOR'S DID THIS BY. PARTICIPATING IN LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PC PROCEEDINGS FILING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PLEADINGS IN THOSE CASES AND WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATE FOR CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CPC AND OTHER FORMS. AND I'M ALSO PROUD TO SAY THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE. OUR SAVINGS FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS IS NOW OVER FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK ON GENERATE CASES AND OTHER RATE IMPACTING PROCEEDINGS WE ALSO ADVANCED A POLICIES. TOWARDS ADVOCATING FOR AFFORDABLE AND UNIVERSAL SERVICES FOR UTILITY SERVICES ENSURING SAFE AND RELIABLE UTILITY OPERATIONS AND ADVOCATING FOR THE COST EFFECTIVE ADVANCEMENT OF THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. A KEY DRIVER OF OUR MISSION IS ADVOCATING FOR AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE WERE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE PC'S RULE MAKING THAT'S FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE AFFORDABILITY ACROSS INDUSTRY SECTORS. BUT EVEN BEFORE THIS PROCEEDING WAS OPENED WE WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN BRINGING TO THE PC'S ATTENTION AND CALLING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PIECE MEAL. RATE INCREASES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE GENERAL RATE CASES -- TO MAKE SURE THAT. THESE ADDITIONAL INCREASE RON RATES ARE TRANSPARENT AND THAT THE PC IN CONSIDERING THESE VARIOUS REQUESTS CAN CAN LOOK AT THAT THE BROADER PICTURE SO WE HAVE. RECOMMENDED TO THE PC THAT UTILITIES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF RECENT AND PENDING AND FUTURE INCREASES ON RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS RATES AND BILLS. AND THIS INFORMATION WOULD ENABLE THE PC TO BETTER PRIORITIZE UTILITY PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S POLICIES AND MORE TRANSPARENT MANNER. OF COURSE ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART IMPORTANT PART OF OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE FOR COST EFFECTIVE SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED IN A SAFE. AND RELIABLE MATTER. AND HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY OPERATE AND MANAGE THEIR FACILITIES IS PARAMOUNT. TO ENSURING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. OVER THE LAST DECADE IN PARTICULARLY SINCE THE TRAGIC SAN BRUNO NATURAL GAS PIPELINE EXPLOSION. WE HAVE BROADENED AND DEEPENED OUR SAFETY EXPERTISE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD ADVOCATING FOR STRONGER SAFETY REGULATIONS AND UTILITY COMPLIANCE. FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE SUCCESSFULLY ADD ADVOCATED THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BE REQUIRED TO PRESSURE TEST AND WHERE NECESSARY REPLACE PARTS OF ONE OF THEIR MAJOR NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION LINES. WE PROVIDE A COMPELLING AN ACCURATE INFORMATION TO SHOW THAT. THEY NEEDED TO PRINT PRESSURE TEST SEIZE FIND CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS AND AND THE PC DID ADOPT THAT. WE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR ENHANCED CUSTOMER PROTECTIONS ACROSS ENERGY AND WATER SERVICES THEY WOULD BE IN PLACE ANY AFTER ANY NATURAL DISASTER MAKING IT EASIER FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR. TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE DISCOUNTED RATES AS WELL AS A SPENDING VARIOUS FEES AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR SERVICE UP AND RUNNING. MORE QUICKLY. YOU PROCEDURES. TO IMPLEMENT SB NINE A ONE AND THERE WERE FOCUSED OUR REVIEW ON THE UTILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH SB WHAT NINE A ONE REQUIREMENTS. OUR THIRD POLICY GOAL OF COURSE IS TO HELP ADVANCE THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS MOST EFFECTIVELY. HERE WE SEE. A CRITICAL. TO CREATE POLICIES THAT WILL ACHIEVE A 100% RENEWABLES BUT IN A WAY THAT'S COST EFFECTIVE SO THAT THESE. THESE POLICIES CAN ALSO BE EXPORTABLE TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY NOT BE WILLING TO PAY QUITE AS MUCH. SO OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S ONLY RESPONSE OF FOR ABOUT 1% OF THE WORLD'S GHG EMISSIONS. SO WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS CAN BE READILY EXPORTABLE. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THAT WE ADVOCATED FOR THE UTILITY TRANSPORTATION LIKED VACATION PROGRAMS. TO ENABLE INCREASED DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTRIC. VEHICLES WHILE MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS AND IN PARTICULAR WE PRIORITIZE TRANSPORTATION LIKE VACATION IN DISADVANTAGE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SEC S. TO SEPARATE SITTING COURAGE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING AT TIMES THAT WOULD ENHANCE GRIN RELIABILITY. AND ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT MAXIMIZE LESSONS LEARNED AND PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND SO WHAT THE PC ADOPTED WAS A BUDGET THEY REDUCE THE UTILITY'S REQUEST BY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BUT STILL ACHIEVED AT THE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. DEPLOYMENT THAT WAS MORE IS DESIRED. SO WITH THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY SO I'M GONNA JUST WRAP UP AND SAY THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL GOING FORWARD. AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR NICHOLS CENTER SKINNER [inaudible] CENTER HERTZBERG [inaudible] ONE TWO SENATOR OUT [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] SO OF MS ACOSTA COULD YOU GIVE US ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU JUST GAVE A VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLE. OF WHERE -- YOUR INTERVENTIONS ARE YOUR OFFICES INTERVENTIONS -- I HELP TO YOU SEE. A DOCTOR RULE THAT. PROVIDED THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION OR INCREASING TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION WITH STILL -- GIVING SOME RATE SAVING SOME FUNDS FOR REPAIRS AND DIRECTING POTENTIALLY SOME OF THE ACTIVITY. TOWARDS RATE PAYERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT -- BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM CAN YOU GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS CONCRETE ONE SURE BE HAPPY TO SO ANOTHER ONE IS IN THE PRECEDING WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO INTEGRATE MORE IT DE OURS ON TO THE GRID -- THERE WE ARE LOOKING BOTH AT WHERE WHERE CAN THOSE -- IN IT DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES BE -- BEST INTEGRATED WITH THE GRID TO MAXIMIZE BENEFIT AS WELL AS WHAT ARE THE WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE -- BEST MIX OF RESOURCES TO TO A WAY THAT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE -- AND WE AS PART OF THAT PROCEEDING WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE ARE SERVED AND I DON'T KNOW I'VE GOT THEM COURSE MY DEPUTY FOR ENERGY HERE SO IF LINDA WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING [inaudible] TO THAT. IN THE THE DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE PLANNING PROCEEDING WHICH IS WHAT -- ELIZABETH WAS SPEAKING TO A WE ACTUALLY PROPOSED IT WAS ADOPTED AND FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING WHERE -- A PROCESSOR FRAME IT FOR DID IDENTIFY WHERE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES SHOULD BEST BE PLACED ON THE SYSTEM TWO AND A TO ENSURE OUR TO SUPPORT RELIABILITY AS WELL AS TO INSURER. OR SPPORT THE STATE'S BUDGET SHE REDUCTION GOALS SO THAT WAS A A MASSIVE PROJECT FRANKLY CAUGHT TRYING TO COME UP WITH A FAIR PROCESS. AS WELL AS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS BECAUSE AS YOU WELL KNOW OF THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS IN THE DISPUTE ENERGY RESOURCE WORLD -- AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO DEVELOP THE PROJECTS SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A FAIR. PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERYBODY AND THAT WEEK THEY GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AS WELL AS WE DO. SENATE SKINNER SENATOR RUBIO. SINCE HERTZBERG SENATOR DODD. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BECAUSE A I'M NEW TO THE COMMITTEE ND AND LEARNING SO PREFIGURE PART I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- A COUPLE THINGS THE FIRST WAS A YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE INDEPENDENT BUT YOU ARE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CPUC IS THAT CORRECT. WE'RE NOT EXACTLY A DEPARTMENT IT IS AN INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP -- WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE AT THE PC SO WHERE PHYSICALLY LOCATED AT THE P. C. AND WE SHARE CERTAIN RESOURCES WITH THEM -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. OVER TME THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED AND STRENGTHEN OUR INDEPENDENCE SO THAT WE CAN SPECIFICALLY REPRESENT RATE PAYERS IN. C. P. PROCEEDINGS AND AND OTHER FOR SINGLE MINDED MISSION WHICH IS WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER TO TO ACHIEVE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES FOR CUSTOMERS CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY IN THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. WITHOUT ON THE WEEK THAT IS OUR MISSION AND THAT SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM WHAT WHAT THE PC DOES [inaudible] AND THEN. SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILD FIRES YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE AND REACTIVE AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE MORE IN A REACTIVE. MODE AND AND I USE THE CITY OF ANAHEIM IS AN EXAMPLE THEY'VE SORT OF BEEN PROACTIVE IN WORKING ON REDUCING THE ABILITY OF SPARKS TO BECAUSE WILD FIRES IN THEIR AREAS ARE CANYON TO CENTER AND SO I'M JUST. SORT OF CURIOUS -- YOU SAVE THREE BILLION LAST YEAR. BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A RATE INCREASE WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT MORE AND PROPERTY LOSS I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WE'RE TALKING WHAT THIRTY TEN TIMES MORE. AND AND SO I'M JUST KINDA CURIOUS WORD WORDS THE BALANCE OF OF STAVING. TAX IF YOU KNOW RATE PAYERS SOMETHING BUT ALSO WORKING ON THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF GETTING PROACTIVE. YES WE WE ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF BEING PROACTIVE I I THINK THAT INVESTING IN IMPROVING THAT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE FIRES IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS TO SAVE NOT ONLY LIVES BUT BUT CUSTOMERS. MONEY IN THE IN THE LONG RUN SO -- SO YEAH I FEEL I FEEL STRONGLY ON THAT THAT THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WE HAVE. ADVOCATED IN A NUMBER OF PROCEEDING SAFETY INVESTMENTS EVEN IF THEY HAVE A PRICE TAG ATTACHED TO THEM -- SO WHAT WE WHAT WE TRY TO DO WE WERE ACTUALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN SETTING UP A PROCESS WHERE THE THE SAFETY RISKS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE GENERAL RATE CASE AND LOOKED AT UP FRONT. SO YOU WEREN'T MODELING THE THE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE FINANCIAL ISSUES QUITE AS MUCH SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SAFETY ISSUES IN DECIDING. IN A TRANSPARENT WAY WHAT DOES NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED IN TERMS OF OF SAFETY RISKS AND THEN AND THEN AND THEY GENERATE CASE WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH IT SHOULD COST. SO WE WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE -- A SAFETY INVESTMENT THAT WAS WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE UTILITY -- WHAT WE MIGHT DO IS IS IF THEY WERE COMING IN AT? THREE TO FIVE TIMES WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW OTHER UTILITIES WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE MIGHT ASK WHY IS THIS GOING TO COST YOU SO MUCH IN YOUR TERRITORY VERSUS WHAT IT'S COSTING AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE -- AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY COULD JUSTIFY MAYBE THE TRAIN IS AT DIFFERENT BUT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WE WOULD ASK NOT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT THE BUT IN BUT BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE MOUNT. THAT THAT SHOULD COST YEAH AND I'M FINDING PERHAPS THAT IT COST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A MILE. TO UNDERGROUND UTILITY LINES WHICH IS NOT LOST LIVES AND PROPERTY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS MISTER PICKER SAID HEY WE'RE GONNA KEEP TELEPHONE POLES BECAUSE WE NEED TO PUT UP FIVE G.. BUT CAN'T WE UNDERGROUND THE ELECTRICITY -- TO PREVENT SPARKS IN THE WINDY CONDITIONS AND THEN HAVE LIGHT POLES WITH THE FIVE G. EIGHT UP ON THERE AS AS AS AS AN OPTION. I'VE GOT A MEETING THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING SO MAYBE YEAH RESPOND TO HIS ANSWER HE YEAH WELL THEY YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT YEAH I THINK YOU CERTAINLY CAN UNDERGROUND UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND THEN HAVE. HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOUR FOUR FIVE G. I MEAN CERTAINLY CURRENTLY WITH WITH FOUR G. YOU CAN HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND STILL HAVE UTILITIES UNDERGROUND ANYWHERE WHERE I LIVE I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE. EVERYTHING WAS UNDERGROUND IN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHERE I LIVE SO -- VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT BUT I STILL FOR THE MOST BURKE ITSELF CELL COVERAGE SO -- YEAH I THINK I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH IT IS EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CHEAP. CENTER DOT IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT FINISHED THE IDEA BEHIND FOR ASIAN. FIVE IT IS IT IS NOT NOT AN EXPERT HERE ON ON ON RATES AND EVERYTHING BUT I'VE LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS. THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA GET RESILIENCY AND HAVE THE UTILITIES PARTICULARLY PGD. TRIM ALL THE TREES AT IT NEEDS TRIMMED IN ORDER TO GET IN COMPLIANCE TO PROVIDE SAFETY. THE IDEA THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH ALL THESE RIDICULOUS. I MEAN. THERE IT IT'S IT'S LIKE. EIGHT TO FIFTEEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HANGING ALLIANCE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING IS IS THESE NEW. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TOUGH LONG COATED LINES WITH. MOVING TOWARDS THAT IN THE FUTURE IS PROBABLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE. FOR RATEPAYERS THAN TO GO THROUGH YOU KNOW ALL THESE WERE ALL AREAS AND HE POWER LIGHT AND BE NOT POWER LIGHTS BUT POLLS. AND AND THEN ALSO -- YOU KNOW BURY THE ELECTRICAL I'M I'M I'M JUST SAYING. I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC I THINK THAT THE RATE PAYERS THEN. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO APPROVE IT. DURING SB NINE OH ONE TURN -- THE REPAIR ADVOCATES FOR AG IN BUSINESS AND THE MANUFACTURERS. THEY ALL OPPOSE. NINE OH ONE WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER. FOR ALL THEIR RATE PAYERS. ARE YOU IN THE LONG RUN TO TAKE BUT TO TAKE. YOUR THE COST OVER ABOVE WHAT P. JEANNIE COULD PAY IN THE IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE. AND THEN MOVE IT OFF ON A TWENTY YEAR BOND LET'S SAY. IT JUST TO DEAL TO TO ME. IT JUST SHOWED ME HOW VERY VERY DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE. TO GET ANYTHING THROUGH THE RATE CASE-- YOU KNOW DID TO DO THIS -- IF FOR STRUCTURE. ENHANCEMENT OTHER THAN WHAT WAS. ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I'M NOT GONNA WHAT YOU THINK LIZ BUT WHAT IT DOES TO BE CLEAR SO I'M NOT NECESSARILY ADVOCATING FOR A FOR UNDERGROUND -- EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW I'M JUST% TRYING TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO IT TO THE QUESTION -- BUT YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK CERTAINLY. WE WANT TO ACHIEVE A SAFE RESULT IN IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER [inaudible] POSSIBLE. BUT WE GOT TO BE REALISTIC AND IN TERMS OF WHAT THE RATE BASE. IS GOING TO WANT TO PAY FOR YES YES WILL YOU WON'T GET ANY ARGUMENT FROM US ON THAT WE ARE WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. ABOUT ALL OF THIS PILING ON OF OF OF RATES ON TO THAT CONSUMER AT THE STATE YEAH. THANK YOU. SO CENTER GOD. I TOLD RESPECT WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID. I HAVE A CITY IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS ACTUALLY WANTING TO UNDERGROUND IT WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT AND IS HAVING SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME. WITH THE CPUC AND WITH UTILITIES AND AND THEY ARE THEY EVEN HAD A BALLOT MEASURE. IN NOVEMBER TO INCREASE SALES TAX JUST UNDERGROUND. UTILIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE FIRE NOW THAT WHAT THEY'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR COMMUNITY. WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHERS THEY'RE THEY'RE EVEN MORE -- FOCUSED ON IT SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PREVENT. IN INTO TO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A COMMUNITY THAT WANTS TO INVEST. IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND PAY FOR THE UNDERGROUND YOU'RE SUBSTANTIALLY PAY FOR THE UNDER GROUNDING. I MEAN I I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THAT WOULD TAKE A LONG. A LOT OF TIME -- AND CONSERVATION EVERYTHING TO GET COMPLETED YEAH ACTED CURTAINS. WE SHOULD TALK OFF LINE SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIR BY STIRS GLACIER -- SHARE THE SAME. CONCERNS ABOUT THE SPEEDOF THE UNDERGROUND IN PROCESS EVEN THOUGH EVEN FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PAY FOR IT OF HEARD SOME CREATIVE IDEAS -- TO BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS BACK ON THIS -- TO RATE PAYER QUESTION I WAS GETTING AT WITH THE WITH BAKER AND HIS TEAM IN TERMS OF COSTS ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE THAT ARE GETTING SORT OF EMBEDDED FROM -- FROM GAS PIPELINE SAY SAFETY YOUR REPAIR COSTS. SO FIRST QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT THE REASONABLENESS OF INCLUDING THAT IN ELECTRIC RATES SAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE HEARD A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS WINTER TO DO SO SUPPLY. CONSTRAINTS I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPAIR PROCESS PERIOD -- HAVE YOU GUYS LOOKED AT THAT AT ALL AND ARE THERE ANY. IN THE END UNLESS WE'RE ABLE TO SHOW THAT SAY THE THERE WAS LIKE A WILLFUL OR NEGLIGENT ACT BY. THE GAS COMPANY NOT TO REPAIRS A LINE TO THIRTY FIVE IS THERE% ANYTHING ANY OTHER WAY TO SORT OF PREVENT THOSE COSTS FROM BEING JUST SORT OF INSTANTLY PASSED THROUGH WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT TO SEVEN CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC RATE PAYERS. YES SO FIRST OF ALL WE WOULD CERTAINLY IF IF EITHER AS C. E. OR SO CAL GAS IS FOUND RESPONSIVE AND THAN THOSE COSTS A HUNDRED MILLION OR ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IT SHOULD NOT BE PASSED ALONG TO IT TO RATE PAYERS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WILL FALL CERTAINLY NEGLIGENCE WILL DO I'VE IF IT'S SHOWN THAT THEY HAVEN'T. ACTED IN A RESERVE AS A REASONABLY PRUDENT MANAGER IS THE STANDARD -- SO AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND THEN -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THOSE COSTS GETTING PASSED ALONG IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LET LINDA JUMP IN HERE. ANSWER THAT PART. ON THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SIDE WE HAVE ACTUALLY IN OUR PLEADINGS -- HAVE. A IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE RATE PAYER RESPONSIBILITY AND SAYING THAT IF THE UTILITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE. OF THROUGH NEGLIGENCE THE NEGLIGENCE OR IMPRUDENCE OF VENN CERTAINLY RIGHT HERE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE SEPARATE WHAT WE CALL MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS OR TRACKING ACCOUNTS. TO BOOK THE LEAST SO CANYON ANY A LEASE SO CAN YOU RELATED COSTS SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK YOU KNOW THIS THERE BEEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. THAT WERE NISH INITIATED TO TRY TO ADDRESS A REALLY HATE THE SITUATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE SHUTDOWN OF OF LISA CANYON. AND WE WE ARE PLEADING SO THAT SHOULD. OF THE UTILITY BE FOUND AT FAULT THE WILL KNOW WHAT BECAUSE SHOULD REVERT BACK TO THE UTILITY NOT SURE HOLD AND REPAIRS. GOTCHA AND DO YOU THINK THAT THIS. IS THIS LINE THOUGH RELATED TO A LEASE SO OR OR NOT LIKING IT FIT INTO THAT SEPARATE MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT OR IS THERE SOME OTHER. THERE HAS TO BE SORT OF INDEPENDENTLY. ADOPTED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR THIS BECAUSE IT pHAPPENING INTO WITH LINE I THINK IT'S LINE. ONE THOUSAND ANOTHER COMBAT BECAUSE THE WHEN THEY THEY'RE REPAIRING TO THIRTY FIVE VERY EXPEDITIOUSLY NOW IT'S INTERESTING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PC CALLS AND STARTS ASKING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AFTER A YEAR OF DOING NOTHING. BUT BUT YEAH WELL I I JUST WANT TO SEE IS REPEAT THIS IN THE NEXT WINTER SEASON IF THEY'RE OFFLINE AGAIN -- SO IS THERE HOW DID THESE HOW TO THE THAT MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT THAT TRACKING OR THAT A THAT. CASH ACCOUNTING. TO MY IN MY EXPERIENCE USUALLY A PARTY HAS TO REQUEST A CONTINENT SOMETHING THAT IS JUST DONE. SOMETIMES THE TOADIES WILL REQUESTED IF IT IF IT'S IN THEIR FAVOR FRANKLY -- AND SO WILL IT WILL WILL ALWAYS REQUEST A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT -- IF WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO PROTECT REPAIRS AND POTENTIALLY SHIELD THEM FROM THOSE COSTS AT THE UTILITIES FOUND AT FAULT IS IS IS THAT SOME OF YOU GUYS ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER ON TO THIRTY FIVE YES. OKAY -- AND AND THEN JUST THE FINAL QUESTION THERE WOULD BE CHIU TO JUST IN GENERAL WITH OUR PIPELINE SYSTEM I KNOW WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON WILDFIRES TODAY BUT I'M. THERE THERE'S A LOT OF WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THESE KINDS OF LINES OF THEY CAN'T SENSE REMOTELY. THE RUPTURES ON EVEN DETECTED IMMEDIATELY. EVERYONE SCARED ABOUT SAN BRUNO BUT THERE'S PLENTY OTHERS AND I WOULD APPLAUD YOU BY THE WAY ON THE YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK AROUND COMMUNITIES NEARBY NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSIONS LINES I BELIEVE. YEAH WHICH LINE SIXTEEN HUNDRED THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT REASONING BUT JUST. DO YOU THINK THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND YOU ALL AS THE OFFICE OF THAT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE I GOTTA GET USED TO THAT -- ONE DO YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VARIOUS EXPENDITURES SAY ON REPAIRS. MAINTENANCE LIKE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES TIMING IN DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH DATA DO YOU THINK TO MAKE. ASSESSMENTS ON THE PRUDENCE OF VARIOUS PROPOSED GAS TRANSMISSION. UPGRADES. YEAH OUT WELL WHAT WHAT WE DO IN ANY GIVEN PROCEEDING IF A UTILITY COMES IN AND REQUEST AN UPGRADE -- WE WOULD WE WOULD ASK FOR THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND WE WOULD GET THE DATA THA WE NEED TO TO EVALUATE THAT WE HAVE FOUND IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES THAT. RECORD KEEPING ISN'T WHAT IT SHOULD BE -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE CASE IN SAN BRUNO WHAT WERE SEEN IT ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AS WELL AND AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD RECORDS ABOUT AND THEN EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE GOTTEN THE GROUND. IT'S VERY HARD TO TO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE SAFETY FRANKLY SO BUT IT' ON A REAL IT'S REALLY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT I'M HERE I SAY LIKE THEY'LL PROPOSE SOME UPGRADE THAT'S RIGHT AND AND THEN YOU. TRY TO SOLICIT INFORMATION BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY A PROACTIVE PROCESS SAVE MAPPING THE ENTIRE NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IN THE AGE OF IT -- THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT THAT SPECIFIC EFFORT BUT THROUGH OF VARIOUS RESEMBLANCE REVIEWS THAT WERE THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING. WE ARE OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS CERTAINLY BUILDING QUITE A DATABASE OF INFORMATION. OR LACK OF INFORMATION FRANKLY OF FOM THE UTILITIES SO WE ARE ACTIVELY GOING AFTER THAT INFORMATION. IF YOU IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO A MASS THAT AND PUT SOME KIND OF COMPENDIUM TOGETHER I KNOW MY OFFICE WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT TO THE EXTENT IT'S IT'S SHAREABLE WOULD WANT ANY NON PUBLIC INFORMATION BUT THINGS HAVING WE'RE KEENLY INTERESTED IN AND WHICH ONE FULLY. ARMED FULLY INFORMED. YOU KNOW PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONERS TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS HERE BECAUSE THE FACT IS WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW LINE THOSE THINGS GET ADVERTISE FOR NEW HOMEOWNERS I MEAN EVERYONE BUILDING A NEW HOME NOW. IN IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE ALL HAVE TO BEAR THE COST. OF WHATEVER THAT NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION LINE IS OUT THERE AND ADVERTISE THAT OVER THERE THEIR RATES NOT THE DEVELOPERS BUT OVER THERE'S FOR DECADES SO. IF WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH FOR SB ONE HUNDRED IS IT REALLY PRUDENT TO GO BUILD IN A BUNCH NEW MORE STRANDED SSETS. WE WE SENATOR WE COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND WHENEVER THESE TYPES OF PROPOSALS COME IN THAT IS EXACTLY HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT WE SAY IS IS IS IS A TRANSMISSION LINE. REALLY NEEDED IN A WATER THE OTHER WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES NEARBY -- BECAUSE WE FULLY AGREE FOR A LOT OF REASONS IN ADDITION TO COST YOU WE AND WE DON'T WANT TO BUILD MORE TRANSMISSION LINES OUT THERE AND CONFERENCE THAT ARE NECESSARY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER STERN THANK YOU MISS ACKLES THANKS FOR GIVING YOUR ANNUAL REPORT. I'M SURE -- THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT -- BUT WE HAVE SOME LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND AND THIS IS AFFECTING ALL OF US. A INTO OVER ALL BEGINNING EDUCATED CENTER DOT MENTIONED HOW MUCH SHE LEARNS IN THE LAST SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT EVEN FOR ME JUST TO WATCH ONE CITY IN MY DISTRICT THAT. WAITED TEN YEARS FOR FIRE MAPS. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE REALLY YOU KNOW IS THIS IS THIS CPUC IS IT IS IT THAT BIG THAT SLOW THAT POLITICAL WHAT. WHAT CAN WE DO IS NOW YOU'RE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE? FOR YOU KNOW BOTH OF YOU. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL LIKE I SAID A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR LEADERSHIP WE GOT A WE CAN WE CAN DO BETTER. SO THANK YOU. FOR COMING THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR NOW WILL HAVE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I SEE ONLY ONE PERSON LINED UP SO YOU HAVE -- EVERY THIRTY MINUTES WELL IF YOU CAN SENATOR BRADFORD FOR MY ATTENDANCE -- BOND GILBERT REPRESENTING CLEAN POWER AT STAFF SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMUNITY TWICE AGGREGATOR -- I WAS HERE WATCHING OST THE HEARING WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE TURNED ON THE TV. AT THE COME BACK -- SO -- I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT AND AFFECTION FOR SENATOR BRADFORD BY HALF THE RESPECTFULLY TAKE ISSUE. WITH HIS COMPARISON OF CCA'S TO ENRON AND REFERRING TO CCA'S AS NOTHING BUT THIRD PARTY REMARKETERS OF ENERGY -- CERTAINLY. ALL THE OF THE THE I. O. U.'S CCA'S. THEY HAVE THEIR ATTRIBUTES AND THEY HAVE THEIR CHALLENGES NEITHER SYSTEM IS PERFECT GRANT YOU THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- YOU ALL WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE BOTH SYSTEMS BETTER BEFORE THE YEAR AND BUT I I YOU KNOW I WAS HERE DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WERE LET LOOSE. REPRESENTING ENERGY CLIENTS. AND RHYME. WAS A IS A PRIVATE CORPORATION THAT WAS PROVEN TO HAVE PERPETRATED FRAUD. UPON ITS SHAREHOLDERS UPON P. JEANNIE AND CALIFORNIA RATE PAYERS -- YOU KNOW THEY COOK THEIR BOOKS -- THE CCA'S ARE REPRESENTED. BY LOCAL ELECTIVES ARE LOCAL ELECTED CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS -- SUPERVISOR AS BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS OR APPOINTED BY LOCAL ELECTED'S. C. C. A.'S ARE THE MOST RECENT ARE ONE OF THE MOST RESPONSIVE. FORMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF ENERGY DELIVERY THAT THERE IS -- I WOULD WAGER TO SAY THAT 95% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE CALIFORNIA. WITH THE CPUC AS IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RATES FOR WITH SOME DECISION THAT AT THAT ARE REGULATED I OWE YOU. HAS MADE WITH REGARD TO ENERGY ACQUISITION OR SOMETHING ELSE. IF THEY KNOW THAT THE CPC IS A REGULATORY BODY. THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A REAL VIABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR JOE SMITH FROM LANCASTER THE COME UP AND PETITION THE CPUC. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A REAL VIABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO COME UP AND GO TO ADDIS IN AND TALK TO THE YOU KNOW SOME SOME OFFICER OF THAT I OWE YOU. AND GET REDRESS HOWEVER. CITIZENS IN THOUGH WHO THEIR SUPERVISORS ARE THEY KNOW WHO THEIR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE AND THEY AND THEY CERTAINLY KNOW AND SAN FRANCISCO HOW TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. AND IF THEY HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THEIR RATES OR ABOUT SOME DECISION THAT CLEAN POWER SF MAKES THAT THEY DON'T LIKE. BELIEVE ME THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE. THE SEEKING REDRESS SO I WOULD HAVE AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT TO COMPARE LOCAL ELECTED'S. TO TO THE CORPORATE BOARD OF A BOARD THAT COMMITTED FRAUD ON THIS STATE IN FACT THERE FOR WHICH MANY WERE ALL STILL PAYING THREE D. W. R. BILL. THIRTY W. OUR CONTRACTS IS REALLY -- I THINK A BIT ON THE RECKLESS SIDE -- SO I JUST I I ALSO WANT TO SAY ONE OTHER THING THEN I'LL I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR -- I UNDERSTAND I WASN'T HERE FOR IT SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M MISTAKEN. THAT THERE WAS A CHARACTERIZATION MADE THAT CCA'S ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO CLEAN ENERGY FIRST OF ALL WE GLADLY ACCEPT THAT MANTLE IF IF THAT WAS STATED. AND PROUDLY -- SINCE SINCE WE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE HORRIBLE WEATHER EVENTS THAT CAUSE. THE BUSINESS THE SUPER FIRES WERE DEALING WITH DON'T AND OCCUR. BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY FY I THAT CCA'S DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TWO QUICK EXAMPLES AND I'M DONE WITH MY TESTIMONY. CINEMAS CCA HASN'T HAS ENABLED MANY WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE BE ABLE TO PURCHASE. ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO DO SO LANCASTER CCA HAS ENABLED THE CITY TO ACQUIRE GHG FREE PUBLIC BUSES. SO WE DO A LOT OF STUFF SO THANK YOU FOR THE OP MISTER GILBERT I SAID THIRTY MINUTES I WAS KIDDING. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS US IN PUBLIC COMMENT -- WELL THEN WE ARE OFFICIALLY ADJOURNED AS OUR UNLESS THERE'S ANYTHING OF TWENTY OKAY THANK YOU
