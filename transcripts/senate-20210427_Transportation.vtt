THAT. THRESHOLD FOR THESE

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:39.050
FINANCIAL TOOLS IS SO HARD AND

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:39.985
THEY CAN'T EVEN GROW THEIR

BUSINESS. OUTSIDE THE

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BECAUSE

THIS HAS NOT BEEN TRIED BEFORE

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:52.798
NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE WE

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.466

EMISSION. VEHICLES BUT THAT'S

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:03.408
JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.777
MONEY THAN GOD. SO THIS IS A

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.879

NOT TO MENTION INCREDIBLY LONG

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.697
WAIT TIMES WERE DURING THE HOT

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.632
SUMMER MONTHS. PEOPLE HAVE

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:39.316
HOT OUT THERE AND UNCOMFORTABLE

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:41.484

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.586

THESE EXTENSIONS ARE ALSO

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.326
GRANTED HOWEVER BECAUSE THE DMB

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.461
SYSTEMS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.063
HANDLING THE TREMENDOUS INFLUX

00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:55.165

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:02.372
THE PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE DID

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:06.076

YEARS LATER WE ARE STILL IN THE

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:15.652
SAME SPOT. THIS IS A COMMON

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:18.488
SENSE BILL AIMED AT ALLEVIATING

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:19.956
SOME OF THE LOG JAM AT THE DMV.

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:21.758

TOUGH. WHAT WAIT TIMES ARE

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.833
GOING TO LOOK LIKE. SO I WOULD

00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:30.967
SAY IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.936
REDUCING UNNECESSARY VISITS

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:33.937

OPTING OUT IN OPTING IN I HAD

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.911
TO- A COUPLE YEARS AGO I THINK

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.446
I WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN TRYING

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.782

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:29.117
AN OPT OUT. OF ICON ON THE

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.919
SCREEN SHOT THAT YOU HAVE A DMV

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.955
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE- PROBLEMS

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:36.058
THAT THAT- EMANATED FROM THE

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:36.992
ROLL OUT OF FIVE THE MOTOR

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:40.495
VOTER- I. ACTUALLY HAD SOME-

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:42.264
INTERESTED IN MAKING IT MORE OF

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:45.434
A- OF A FIX AT TO DMB AND

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.635
SECRETARY OF STATE RATHER THAN

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.303
LEGISLATION SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.839
A FURTHER DISCUSSION. WITH US

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.874
SENATOR- AND I MENTIONED THAT

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.910
TO HIM SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.545
WHAT I WAS PROPOSING. AND HOW

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:57.612
THAT MIGHT BE FOLDED AND

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.014
THROUGH SOME AMENDMENT PROCESS

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.515
ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I THINK IT

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.284
IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE. THE

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.919
OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT THIS

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:04.920
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.355
COMPLICATED KNOWING THAT DMB

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:08.657

OB TECHNICAL. CONNECTION TO

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.961
SECRETARY OF STATE BUT I THINK

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.463
IT'S WORTH A DISCUSSION BECAUSE

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.431
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.133

WHETHER BE IN THE OTHER PARTY

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.872
AND I THINK MANY OF OUR OFFICES

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.640
WERE INUNDATED INITIALLY. ARE

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.676

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:31.046
TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND I

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:36.518

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:42.017
HUGE IMPACT ON OUR CONGESTION

AND TRAFFIC GOING FORWARD. NOW

03:07:43.619 --> 03:07:44.653
THIS IS WHY THE DISCUSSIONS

03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:45.988
OVER THE TWO FORTY ONE HAVE

03:07:46.054 --> 03:07:47.055

03:08:07.275 --> 03:08:09.277

UNLESS CERTAIN BURKE BENCHMARKS

03:08:15.450 --> 03:08:17.252
WERE MET. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:18.120
THAT THE ONLY REASON THIS

03:08:18.186 --> 03:08:19.521
RESOLUTION HAS NOT BEEN MORE

03:08:19.588 --> 03:08:20.822

BEING ADOPTED INTO THE

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:26.495
RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S

03:08:26.561 --> 03:08:27.329
IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE

03:08:27.396 --> 03:08:28.930
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SHORT

03:08:28.997 --> 03:08:29.698

03:08:29.765 --> 03:08:31.733

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:34.436
PULL THAT UP ON YOUR PHONE YOU

03:08:34.503 --> 03:08:36.405
CAN SEE IT ENDS ABRUPTLY RIGHT

03:08:36.471 --> 03:08:37.139
IN THE MIDDLE COULD CAUSE IN

03:08:37.205 --> 03:08:38.907
MISSION VIEJO. THE IDEA WAS

03:08:38.974 --> 03:08:40.342
ALWAYS TO HAVE THE TWO FORTY

03:08:40.409 --> 03:08:42.044
ONE CONNECTED TO FIVE AND

03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:42.678
THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA CODE

03:08:42.744 --> 03:08:44.246
IS WRITTEN THE WAY IT IS. IN

03:08:44.312 --> 03:08:45.414
THE SHORT RUN I BECOME

03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:47.115

03:08:50.686 --> 03:08:51.186
EXTENSION OF THE FIVE IS NOT

03:08:51.253 --> 03:08:54.156
NECESSARY- AND THAT IS

03:08:54.222 --> 03:08:54.690
SOMETHING THAT ALL PARTIES

03:08:54.756 --> 03:08:55.824
AGREE UPON. BUT THAT MAY NOT

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:57.459
NECESSARILY BE THE CASE IN THE

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:03.765
BE. SEEN AS DESIRABLE OR

03:09:03.832 --> 03:09:04.733

03:09:06.568 --> 03:09:08.403
AFFORDABILITY AND FACILITATING

03:09:08.470 --> 03:09:10.539
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY IN THE

03:09:10.605 --> 03:09:11.073
REGION INCLUDING MANY KEY

03:09:11.139 --> 03:09:12.474
CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. IT MAY

03:09:12.541 --> 03:09:13.642
WELL BE THE CASE THAN FIVE

03:09:13.709 --> 03:09:14.976
YEARS AND TEN YEARS IN FIFTEEN

03:09:15.043 --> 03:09:16.478
YEARS WE DECIDED WE VERY WELL

03:09:16.545 --> 03:09:18.413
NEED THIS EXPANSION. NOW IT'S

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:19.214
BEEN SAID THAT THIS BILL

03:09:19.281 --> 03:09:20.749
CODIFIES THE AGREEMENT BUT IT

03:09:20.816 --> 03:09:21.750
ACTUALLY GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:23.518
THAT IF PERMANENTLY ENDS THE

03:09:23.585 --> 03:09:24.553
POSSIBILITY TO TWO FORTY ONE

03:09:24.619 --> 03:09:25.887
EXTENSION. TAKING AWAY AN

03:09:25.954 --> 03:09:27.289
OPTION THAT I THINK ALL OF OUR

03:09:27.355 --> 03:09:28.523
REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITIES IN

03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:30.325
CITIES. RECOGNIZE COULD BE AN

03:09:30.392 --> 03:09:32.060
IMPORTANT ROUTE IN THE FUTURE

03:09:32.127 --> 03:09:33.995
FOR EASING CONGESTION. WE IN

03:09:34.062 --> 03:09:35.030
THE LEGISLATURE WIELD AN

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:37.099
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POWER AND I

03:09:37.165 --> 03:09:37.666
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL

03:09:37.733 --> 03:09:39.935
ABOUT HOW WE USE THAT POWER.

03:09:40.001 --> 03:09:40.569
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S TO WEIGH

03:09:40.635 --> 03:09:42.304
IN ON A LOCAL ISSUE. THERE ARE

03:09:42.370 --> 03:09:43.905
SEVERAL PRINCIPLES AT WORK THAT

03:09:43.972 --> 03:09:45.941
CAUSED ME TO OPPOSE THIS BILL.

03:09:46.007 --> 03:09:46.875
FIRST WE EITHER WE HAVE THE

03:09:46.942 --> 03:09:48.510
PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL.

03:09:48.577 --> 03:09:50.212
THERE IS A LOCAL PROCESS IN

03:09:50.278 --> 03:09:51.213
PLACE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE

03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:52.981
WITNESSES. AND ACHIEVE THE

03:09:53.048 --> 03:09:54.349
DESIRED RESULTS THERE ARE NO

03:09:54.416 --> 03:09:57.586
PLANS RIGHT NOW. EXTENDED 2401%

03:09:57.652 --> 03:09:58.820
COMMITTEE OR ANYONE ANYWHERE

03:09:58.887 --> 03:10:01.423
ELSE. SECOND THIS BILL IS NOT

03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:02.424
NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE

03:10:02.491 --> 03:10:03.625
PROBLEM IS TRYING TO SOLVE AND

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:04.726
POTENTIALLY CREATES LONG RUN

03:10:04.793 --> 03:10:06.461
PROBLEMS. IF THE GOAL IS TO

03:10:06.528 --> 03:10:07.696
PREVENT A SHORT TERM EXPANSION

03:10:07.763 --> 03:10:09.397
OF THE AT TWO FORTY ONE THE

03:10:09.464 --> 03:10:10.699
BILL IS UNNECESSARY. BUT BY

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:12.601
ENDING A TWO FORTY ONE IT

03:10:12.667 --> 03:10:14.069
DESTROYS THE FLEXIBILITY OF

03:10:14.136 --> 03:10:16.638
REGIONAL ACTORS TO ADDRESS

03:10:16.705 --> 03:10:17.906
TRANSIT ISSUES GOING FORWARD.

03:10:17.973 --> 03:10:18.707
THIRD THIS BILL IS

03:10:18.774 --> 03:10:20.342
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR AS IT

03:10:20.408 --> 03:10:22.110
FAVORS THE INTERESTS OF ONE

03:10:22.177 --> 03:10:24.546
DISTRICT. INDEED ONE CITY. OVER

03:10:24.613 --> 03:10:25.113
THE INTERESTS OF OTHER LOCAL

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:27.149
STAKEHOLDERS. THE TWO FORTY ONE

03:10:27.215 --> 03:10:28.917
ISSUES I MENTION IS NOT JUST

03:10:28.984 --> 03:10:29.518
THE SAN CLEMENTE ISSUE IT'S A

03:10:29.584 --> 03:10:31.253
REGIONAL ISSUE. THIS BILL

03:10:31.319 --> 03:10:33.021
PRIORITIZES THE INTERESTS OF

03:10:33.088 --> 03:10:34.556
ONE CITIES ONE CITY OVER THE

03:10:34.623 --> 03:10:36.324
INTERESTS OF MANY OTHERS. I

03:10:36.391 --> 03:10:37.425
THINK THE LIST OF SUPPORT IN

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:38.560
OPPOSITION MAKES THIS VERY

03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:40.962
CLEAR THE SUPPORTERS ARE ALMOST

03:10:41.029 --> 03:10:41.563
UNIVERSALLY BASED OUT OF SAN

03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:42.864
CLEMENTE. WHERE IS THE

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:44.633
OPPOSITION COMES FROM ACROSS

VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE SB

03:11:03.919 --> 03:11:04.519
SEVEN SIXTEEN THEY SENT A

03:11:04.586 --> 03:11:05.787
LETTER TO THIS BODY. AND I'D

03:11:05.854 --> 03:11:07.422

STATES IN PART. THE PROCESS TO

03:11:14.062 --> 03:11:15.230
DEFINE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS WITH

03:11:15.297 --> 03:11:16.665
THE SUCCESS WHICH IS WHY

03:11:16.731 --> 03:11:18.500
LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY. AND

03:11:18.567 --> 03:11:19.868
MAY UNDERMINE THE GOODWILL AND

03:11:19.935 --> 03:11:21.303
TRUST THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A

03:11:21.369 --> 03:11:23.038
RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS. THIS

03:11:23.104 --> 03:11:24.472
MULTI AGENCY THAT SOLUTION

03:11:24.539 --> 03:11:25.674
DEMONSTRATES THAT LOCAL ISSUES

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:26.842
CAN BEST BE RESOLVED BY THE

03:11:26.908 --> 03:11:28.443
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND

03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:29.778
IGNORING THIS REGIONAL APPROACH

03:11:29.845 --> 03:11:31.313
COULD SET A BAD PRECEDENT THAT

03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:32.547
WOULD ALLOW SMALL SPECIAL

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:34.683
INTEREST GROUPS TO HALT

03:11:34.749 --> 03:11:35.150
REGIONALLY BENEFICIAL

03:11:35.217 --> 03:11:36.484
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THE

03:11:36.551 --> 03:11:37.752
EXTENT TO WHICH THE CITY OF SAN

03:11:37.819 --> 03:11:38.954
CLEMENTE HAS ATTEMPTED TO

03:11:39.020 --> 03:11:40.155
EXCLUDE THEMSELVES FROM

03:11:40.222 --> 03:11:41.656
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROCESS

03:11:41.723 --> 03:11:43.425
OVER THE YEARS. IT'S AN AFFRONT

03:11:43.491 --> 03:11:44.826
TO OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES.

03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:46.394
THIS REGARDING OUR MUTUAL

03:11:46.461 --> 03:11:47.128
RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIONAL

03:11:47.195 --> 03:11:48.730
TRAFFIC. THEIR LACK OF

03:11:48.797 --> 03:11:49.865
WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE

03:11:49.931 --> 03:11:51.666
EXHIBITS A COMPLETE DISREGARD

03:11:51.733 --> 03:11:52.701
FOR THE OTHER CITIES IN THE

03:11:52.767 --> 03:11:54.202
REGION. THE CITY OF WE THINK

03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:55.470
THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:56.538
OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING

RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY. WE

03:11:58.540 --> 03:11:59.474
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORANCE OF

03:11:59.541 --> 03:12:00.675
BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION TO

03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:01.910
THE REGION'S TRANSPORTATION

03:12:01.977 --> 03:12:05.714
NEEDS. AND BELIEVE IT'S

03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:06.348
INCUMBENT UPON ALL CITIES TO DO

03:12:06.414 --> 03:12:06.948
THEIR PART. NOW I WILL JUST
