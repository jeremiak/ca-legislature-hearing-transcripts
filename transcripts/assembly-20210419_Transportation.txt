THANK YOU- WE HAVE THREE BILLS TO DISCUSS TODAY. AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN MCCARTY. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE REYES AND AB FORTY THREE BY NY. I DO NOT SEE MISTER MCCARTY. IF HE DOESN'T. OR IS THIS THE I DON'T SEE HIM SO UNTIL HE APPEARS I WILL ALLOW FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES TO PRESENT HER BILL. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MA'AM MADAM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO REPRESENT TO YOU AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH WILL MODERNIZE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. BY REVISING ITS PROJECT PREFERENCES TO SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN OUR MOST POLLUTED AREAS. THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL TOOL TO ADVANCE CLEAN VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PROGRAM RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO DEPLOY INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S FUEL AND VEHICLE TYPES. THESE ARE SPECIAL FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN EARMARKED FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND CAN ONLY BE SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THE PROGRAM WAS LAST UPDATED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND SINCE THEN. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CLIMATE POLICIES AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY THAT WARRANT A DISCUSSION ON THE PRIORITIES OF THIS PROGRAM. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE WILL INCORPORATE PROGRAM CHANGES THAT WILL FOCUS INVESTMENTS. IN THE EMERGING MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY FREIGHT INDUSTRY. ADVOCATE FUNDING TO PROJECTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE PREFERENCES FOR PROJECTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND PARTICULATE MATTER IN OUR MOST POLLUTED AREAS. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS MAKE UP 50% OF ALL EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO POOR AIR QUALITY. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS EXTREME. NON ATTAINMENT AREAS UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SUCH AS THE BAY AT BAY AREA SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO RANGE FROM MODERATE TO SEVERE NON ATTAINMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER IN ADDRESSING OUR QUALITY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS CRITICAL TO DEMONSTRATING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY CAN CO EXIST BUT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER WITH CAL STAR. AND BUILD MCGOVERN WITH THE HELP COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION THAT WE HAVE A MOTION THE SECOND LET'S- BRING THE WITNESSES IN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN I MEMBERS. THANK YOU CAN HEAR ME YEAH I'M MAD ABOUT. POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL START HERE IS THE SPONSOR OF EIGHTY THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE. FIRST WE WISH TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT YES FOR HER WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND FOR OFFERING THIS MEASURE. CAL START IS AN INTERNATIONAL MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MEMBERS DEDICATED TO TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. COMPRISED OF PEOPLE MANUFACTURERS ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY AN ALTERNATE FUEL PRODUCERS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FLEETS AND MORE. THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR STATE'S TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THE STATE HAS PASSED MANY LANDMARK CLIMATE LAWS SINCE THIS PROGRAM WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED OVER THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. AND SINCE THEN WE'VE ADOPTED AMBITIOUS MANDATES FOR CLEAN VEHICLES AND SET MANY SPECIFIC VEHICLE EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS SO IT MAKES SENSE TO MODIFY THE STATUTE THAT GUY THESE PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS OUR CURRENT GOALS AS WELL AS RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS MARKET TRENDS. SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE PACE OF PROGRESS. AND ALSO CRITICALLY ENSURE CLEAN AIR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. SO THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER FOR EXAMPLE% THE STATE NEEDS TO REACH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE NEED TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY EASIER EMISSION VEHICLES WHICH WILL BEGIN RAPIDLY COMING TO MARKET BECAUSE OF THE ADVANCING TRUCK ROLL. ANOTHER CARD REGULATION. IT PRETTY THREE THAT WE HAPPY SPONSOR THIS BILL AND WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I'M IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW EXTRA SUPPORT IS NEEDED FOR SMALL FLEETS WHO WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME ACCORDING TO YOUR EMISSION VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE APPRECIATE HER FOCUS ON NOT. AND WELCOME CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AS THE BILL GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS FILLED THE GAP FOR AND WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. MOST OF OUR WORK AT THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IS DEVOTED TO CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BECAUSE- IN CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR. 80% OF OUR LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND ABOUT 50% OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS. WE ARE ALSO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE CHARGE AHEAD CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN WHICH SAYS THE TWIN GOALS OF ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO CLEAN MOBILITY TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. I SERVE ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH THIS BILL ADDRESSES. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE POLLUTION FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND MOST OF THAT AIR POLLUTION CONCENTRATIONS TATIAN IN FACT THERE WERE RESOURCES BOARD FOUND THAT 45% OF THE AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE DISPARITY FOR THE BLACK POPULATION. WAS FROM MOBILE SOURCES. SO WE ASK YOU TO PASS THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. WE PARTICULARLY SUPPORT IT'S A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REVISE THE CRITERIA FOR THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE REDUCTION CRITERIA AIR POLLUTION AND AIR TOXICS. STANDARDS PRIORITIZATION OF DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE EMPHASIS ON CLEANING UP THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WHICH ARE EXPOSING OUR POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO TOXIC DIESEL EXHAUST. AND WE THANK AUTHOR FOR THE PROVISION THAT 50% OF THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO PROJECTS THAT ARE LOCATED IN AND BENEFITING OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDE TANGIBLE EQUITY MEASURABLE ACCOUNTABLE STANDARDS FOR THE PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR IS CONSIDERING NEWS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION WITH HER AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES LISTED IN OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT I'LL GO TO THE CHAMBERS IS ANYBODY IN THE CHAMBERS WHO WANTS TO SPEAK FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL. OKAY WITH ANYBODY TO REMOTE HEARING I'M SPEAKING FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL. OKAY OPERATOR WE SHOULD HAVE A TO RESET THE CLOCK. ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION FOR TWO MINUTES- OPPOSITION STATEMENT OPERATOR CAN YOU SEE IF THERESA COOK IS AVAILABLE BY PHONE. ASSEMBLY MOMENT. THIS COOK PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL I THREE TO COOK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON NOW- EP THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE I WANT TO BEGIN OUR TESTIMONY WAY THE PERSECUTION OF THE AUTHOR AND ON THIRD DESIRE TO TACKLE HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY- IF YOU'LL COLLECTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS HYDROGEN STATION DEVELOPERS AND HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCED THERE. WERE THRILLED TO BE A PART OF THAT SOLUTION HOWEVER THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM I THINK ONE OF SEVERAL PROGRAMS BENEFITING HYDROGEN MOBILITY IT IS THE ONLY PROGRAM BENEFITING HYDROGEN MOBILITY CANNOT AND THEY SHIPPED PROPOSED AN EIGHTY THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE AT THE END AND THE LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN MARKET STILL IN ITS INFANCY WHAT HAPPENED DIRECTLY IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO GROW AND SCALE THE HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO MEET OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE. WE SUGGESTED THAT A DEDICATED SATISFIED OF THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS MUCH LIKE WHAT WAS DONE TEN YEARS AGO WITH THE 20% TO ALLOW HYDROGEN TO GROW AND TO REACH SCALE BEFORE REACHING A POINT AT SELF SUFFICIENCY- WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND VERY WELL INTENDED BUT IT DOESN'T FULLY RECOGNIZE THE DEVELOPMENT PATH THAT HYDROGEN OUT OF EIGHTY- TRANSPORTATION FUEL IS ON THE TOP OF DOING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ARCH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS- YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO HAVE ANY FURTHER WITH A SECOND WITH ON THE FOR. NOT POSITION. NO I DON'T HAVE ANYONE LA SO LET'S OPEN UP THE FOR. IN FAVOR OR A TO THE BILL. ALL RIGHT IF YOU DO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE BILL THESE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. IF YOU ARE USING A TOUCH TONE PHONE PLEASE PICK UP THE- HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS.

THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- FRAZIER FONG. I THANK YOU CARE- BUT TO THE OTHER I CERTAINLY COMING FROM THE A ROBUST AGRICULTURE DISTRICT I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE AND- AND- TO PROVIDE FURTHER INVESTMENTS- IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY. DUTY TRUCK SPACE I WANTED TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE THOUGH ON THE BROADER CONCERN THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE NEED FOR SELF SUFFICIENCY IN THE PUSH FOR. ONE TECHNOLOGY AND PLACING ALL THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET WHICH WOULD COULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT FUNDS FOR OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE IN THE CLEAN ENERGY SPACE. SUCH AS HYDROGEN AND SO- I BELIEVE% THERE'S A BENEFIT. TO ENCOURAGING ALL TYPES OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION SO I WANNA GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON ON ON THAT ISSUE. AND AND KIND OF. YOU KNOW WHAT. THE PASSWORD CARE. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- IN FACT TO THE OPPOSITION FROM HYDROGEN. WAS JUST RECENT AND IN FACT IT WASN'T MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS- BUT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN THE MOVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID ABOUT USING ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AS YOU HAVE INDICATED. HYDROGEN IS ONE OF THOSE AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABSOLUTELY OKAY WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I'M I'M I'M I'M I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I JUST WANTED TO- GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON PROVIDING SOME. CLEAR AND PREDICTABLE PATHS TO SELF SUFFICIENCY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE IMPORTANT AND ABOUT THE WITH ALL THESE INVESTMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE SELF SUFFICIENT BUT THAT WE'RE ALSO. DIVERSIFYING AS WELL SO- I THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. MR BERMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO. SAY THANKS TO THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR. BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD- WELL SHE MIGHT HAVE. TERRIBLE JUDGMENT BASEBALL TEAMS YEAH I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT SHE IS GREAT JUDGMENT AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION POLICY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL ACCEPT THAT AS THE- AS A POSITIVE FOR MY TEAM THE DODGERS. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY ISRAEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. CLEARLY WE NEED CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS TO FOCUS ON AREAS WHERE THE POLLUTION IS THE HIGHEST AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU CAN WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY MOTIONS DALY SECOND BERMAN- AND I I'M SUPPORT THE BILL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ROLL CALL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN HI. FRIEDMAN I FONG. FONG I BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I DALY DALY AYE DAVIES. DAVIES NO GIPSON. KALRA KALRA HI LEE LEE I MEDINA. MEDINA I NAZARIAN. WHEN. DONNA O'DONNELL I WORK. WICKS WICKS HI. THE VOTE IS TEN ONE THE BILL IS OUT WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY YOU ARE NEXT IN MAY BEGIN. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THERE'S TO BE A TABLE HERE. NOPE ANYWAY THANK YOU IS YOUR FRIEDMAN IF THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS FOR MY BILL TODAY THE CLEAN CARS EQUITY ACT WE KNOW THE REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES AND MOBILE SOURCES AS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND FINING CLIMATE CHANGE. AND ALSO CRITICAL IN OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR AIR QUALITY. AND AS WELL AS I SAID ON THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE. IN THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY AND SUFFERED THAT SUFFER FROM ILLNESSES AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION- PASSENGER VEHICLES AS I SAID ARE BOTH THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SMOG AND PARTICULATE AIR MATTERS FLOATING IN THE AIR AND AREAS LIKE SACRAMENTO. CALIFORNIA LEADS AND LEADS THE NATION. IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OPTION BUT WE STILL NEED A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN VADS TO MEET THE GOAL OF FIVE MILLION. THAT ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY AND A THIRTY FIVE. THIS BILL HELPS THE STATE ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT WILL PROMOTE- THE RAPID AND ACHAL EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. OF REBATES BY OFFERING LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS- FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PURCHASE THESE VEHICLES THROUGH EXISTING TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAMS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT REBATES ARE PROVEN. TOOL OF PROMOTING ADOPTION THE POWER OF ECONOMICS. AND INCENTIVES HOWEVER JUST LAST WEEK WITH THE AIRPORT ANNOUNCED THAT IN ONE MONTH WILL BE NO MONEY LEFT. FOR A CURRENT CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM WITH QUESTIONS ON THE VIABILITY. OF OUR CAP AND. TRADE FUNDS AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE. THERE IS CURRENTLY NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TO CONTINUE THIS. IN THIS BILL CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE PROVIDE QUICK CRITICAL REBATE FUNDING. AND FURTHER SPUR- ACTIVITY FROM CONSUMERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SECOND IT WE WILL BE ENSURING THAT THE AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY INCREASING ADOPTION OF THE VEHICLES ARE NOT CANCELLED OUT AGAIN ARE NOT CANCELED OUT. BY THE SALE OF MORE POLLUTING VEHICLES. BECAUSE EVERY PURCHASE OF A NEW GAS POWERED VEHICLE REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND KILOGRAMS OF FUTURE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS OVER ITS LIFETIME. WHICH MEANS EARNESTLY PROMOTING THAT SALES TODAY- COULD NOT BE MORE SIGNIFICANT. MANY AUTOMAKERS MANY AUTOMAKERS HAVE MADE PLEDGES TO SELL THE ADS IN THE NEXT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AND WE APPLAUD. THIS BILL SIMPLY FALL THESE PLEDGES AND FOLLOWS THE ADAGE OF- RUN A REAGAN- AND YOU KNOW TRUST BUT VERIFY SO WE HOPE THAT THIS TRIGGER WILL NEVER HAPPEN AND THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS BUT WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT. THIS WON'T HAPPEN I THINK THE GOALS OF YOUR RESULT WHICH WE CAN ADDRESS A LASTLY BY POVERTY BY PROVIDING- AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE FOR REBATES ON PASSENGER VEHICLES WILL BE ABLE TO USE STATE MONEY. TO INVEST IN A CLEAN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND CLEAN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TESTIFYING WITH ME TODAY ARE BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND DAVID REICH MET A SENIOR ENGINEER. OF THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK YOU AND BELIEVE BOTH YOUR WITNESSES ARE ON THE PHONE- SO OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE BRING US MISTER MY GOVERNOR MR RIGHT CONNECT WHATEVER'S GOING FIRST. GO AHEAD AND- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION OF CLEAN AIR- IN SUPPORT OF THE GREEN CARS EQUITY ACT AS MR MCCARTY JUST STATED AND AS WE DISCUSSED- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGISTERS BILL JUST NOW. MOBILE SOURCES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA BY FAR. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE BORNE DISPROPORTIONATELY BY OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. YEAH IT IS USUALLY THE MEMBERS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD CLEAN MOBILITY. AND THERE IS AN UP FRONT COST DISPARITY BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES AND THE CLEANEST VEHICLES AND THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THE DISPARITY. THE UC DAVIS INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORTATION STUDIES FOUND THAT THIS SORT OF MECHANISM WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDE A DISINCENTIVE FOR BUYING MORE POLLUTING VEHICLES AND ALSO GIVE BUYERS AN INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE CLEANER VEHICLES BY MAKING THEM CHEAPER. IF FOUND UNDER ONE SCENARIO THAT IF THE pLOW INCOME CONSUMERS SWITCHES FROM A THIRTY MILE PER GALLON SEDAN TO A FORTY FIVE MILE PER GALLON HYBRID. THAT CONSUMER WOULD RECEIVE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATE AND GARNER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FUEL SAVINGS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CAR. ALSO FOUND THAT THE MECHANISM WOULD IMPROVE SOCIAL EQUITY BY REDUCING THE COST OF VEHICLES FOR LOWER INCOME BUYERS. AS MUCH MCCARTY STATED THIS BILL COULD REPLACE THE STATE MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR VEHICLE INCENTIVES LIKE QUEEN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT WHICH IS CURRENTLY. RUNNING OUT OF MONEY. AND IT ALSO WOULD FUNDS. EQUITY PROJECTS THAT ARE ALSO STRAPPED FOR FUNDS RIGHT NOW WELL LIKE CLEAN. AND AN OLDER POLLUTING CAR AND GET INTO AN ADVANCE CLEAN CAR. LIKE THE CLEAN VEHICLE ASSISTANCE PROJECT THAT PROVIDES GRANTS AND LOANS FOR LOW INCOME BUYERS TO GET INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES YOUR TIME IS THE ONLY OPTION WE CAN FINISH UP YOUR YOUR TWO MINUTES ARE UP IF YOU CAN JUST FINISH UP. THINGS I WILL ABSOLUTELY GET ALSO FINANCED PROJECTS THAT ALLOW FOR NON VEHICLE OWNING TYPES OF CLEAN MOBILITY THAT WOULD ALSO HELP US REDUCE CLEAN UP REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS DAVID AIKMAN NINE THE SENIOR ENGINEER WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. AND I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY REPORT AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN WHICH ESTABLISHES A SELF SUSTAINING FUND TO INCREASE THE SALES OF ZERO EMISSION PASSENGER CARS AND TRUCKS IN THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA IS A PARTY SEEING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH DROUGHT. HEATWAVES AND UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES. AND WE KNOW THAT WE MUST GREATLY REDUCE EMISSIONS. TO SLOW THE RATE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS MARK. SINGLE SOURCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EMISSIONS IN THE STATE IS TRANSPORTATION. SO THE VITAL THE CALIFORNIA TAKE ACTION BOOKSELLERS TO SWITCH FROM PETROLEUM FUEL CARS TRUCKS. THE CLEANER ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE AIR POLLUTION FROM GASOLINE CARS AND TRUCKS HARMS THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION IS INEQUITABLE. WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EXPOSED THE HIGHER AMOUNTS OF AIR POLLUTION FROM ON ROAD VEHICLES. CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN UP TRANSPORTATION IS IMPORTANT. ABOUT TWO MILLION NEW CARS SOLD EACH YEAR IN THE STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S MADE UP ABOUT 80% OF ALL NEW VEHICLES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. MEETING THAT GOAL OF A 100% THAT FAILED IN JUST FIFTEEN YEARS TIME WILL REQUIRE INNOVATIVE POLICIES SUCH AS AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN. AN INCREASE INCENTIVES FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FUNDED BY AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN WILL HELP SPEED A MORE EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO CLEAN VEHICLES. AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN CREATION OF SELF SUSTAINING PROGRAM WILL ALLOW CLEAN CAR PROGRAMS TO OPERATE WITH MORE CERTAINTY INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE EFFORTS. YOU SEE A SUPPORTABLE OF AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN AND THANKS THE OFFER FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FIRST WE HAVE HEARD FOR AUGUSTINE WHO WAS ON THE PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE BRING MR AUGUSTINE. PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. YES THANK YOU- CHAIR REMEMBERS MY NAME IS KURT AUGUSTINE I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION WHICH IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS 99% OF THE AUTO MAKERS WHO ARE SELLING PEOPLE DENIED STATE AS WELL AS MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS- THAT GO INTO THOSE VEHICLES. WHAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN BUT NOT BASED ON THE QUESTION OF A DEBT FUTURE FOR ALL THE FUTURE OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AT A STRONG ROBUST MARKET FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY ARE CRUCIAL THAT SUCCESS SO WE SHARE THE GOAL OF THE SPONSORS AND THE WITNESSES THAT WE HEARD BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER. TO THAT GOAL. THIS BILL A- BARBECUE STAY. IN GOALS FOR EMISSIONS THAT ARE NOT BASED ON ANY SCIENCE OR DATA. AND THEN IT TURNS AROUND AND FINDS COMPANIES FOR NOT MEETING THOSE STANDARDS. ADDITIONALLY THESE FINES ARE OPEN ENDED WITH NO STATUTORY LIMITS. AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO RECUPERATE THIS MONEY. IT IS UNCLEAR TO AUTOMAKERS HOW FINING AUTO MANUFACTURERS BASED ON CONSUMERS PURCHASES INCENTIVIZES STAFF PURCHASES AND ANYWAY. I'D BEEN STATED THIS CALL IS FOR THE FUNDING OF REBATES. BUT THIS BILL NOT NECESSARY TO DO THAT THE PROGRAM AND FUNDING MECHANISMS ARE ALREADY IN STATUTE AND IN PRACTICE TODAY AND IN FACT THEY'RE BEING DISCUSSED WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY AS WE SPEAK. WE ENDORSE THE CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH HELP CONSUMERS IN NUMEROUS ECONOMIC SITUATIONS ARE STATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE INCENTIVES. IN ADDITION TO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THAT GOAL THIS BILL IS ALSO IN CONFLICT WITH THE UNDERGO ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS FOR A ONE NATIONAL PROGRAM THE KEY TO CONTINUE THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD. THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS AND AUTO MAKERS FOR A GREENHOUSE GAS AND FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS WE ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WITH PRESIDENT FIGHTING TO WITHSTAND THAT CURRENT PROGRAM HOW FOR DECADES PLUS OR MORE CAN SOME UP MR. FINISHED YES THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU AND SO WE AGREED. WHAT DOES PROGRAM BUT MUCH WORK IS NEEDED WE DO NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT TO MEET THAT GOAL OF WHICH IS STATED WITH A PERCENT OF VEHICLE THAT A 12100% INCREASE WE DO NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE HAVE JIM JEFFERIES I BELIEVE IN THE CHAMBERS. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRWOMAN FRIEDMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I MISS TIMOTHY JEFFRIES I'M A POWER BETTER YOUR NICEST RECORD TWELVE YEARS HAVING SERVED. CURRENTLY I AM A- I GRADUATED PRETTY PREVENTABLE MAKERS CURRENTLY I'M A BUSINESS MANAGER SECRETARY CHARGEABLE TO MAKE IT LOOK A LOT FIVE POINT NINE. PITTSBURG CALIFORNIA SEVEN FORCED. BEFORE YOUR TO DATE OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE EIGHTEEN. WE UNDERSTAND THIS COUNTRY'S UNDERTAKEN A GREAT TRANSITION AS WE MOVE FORWARD- REMOVE REMOVED FROM TRYING THIS TRADITIONAL FORMS OF FOSSIL FUELS TO MORE SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF ENERGY. AND THE BOILERMAKERS PLAN BE IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRANSITION. AT THE BOILERMAKERS WE HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY FOR GENERATIONS. AND TODAY WE ARE POISED TO START BUILDING NEW INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND CONVERT EXISTING FACILITIES TO CREATE VERY LOW EMISSION. FUMES WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING TO FOSSIL FUEL REFINERIES IN THE BAY AREA TO HYDROGEN AND BIOFUEL REFINERIES. ONE B. MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA. ALSO IN VEGAS HERE WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT TO BUILD A FACILITY THAT WILL CONVERT PLANT SEED TO BIOFUEL. IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND IS CALIFORNIA WE'RE ABOUT TO BUILD A PLANT. THAT WILL CONVERT POLICY MASK TO CHECK. ALL THESE INCREDIBLE CREDIBLE EXAMPLES OF CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATION PRODUCING NEW CLEAN LOW EMISSION FUELS OF ENERGY. TO POWER CALIFORNIA'S CARS AND TRUCKS. THIS INNOVATION WILL ALSO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLEAN FUELS. AND THIS INNOVATION WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY POWER THEIR CARS AND TRUCKS TO GET. TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND WORK BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHT TWELVE EIGHTY. THIS BILL WILL KILL ALL THE CLEAN FUEL INNOVATION THAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THIS DEAL WAS THIS BILL SEEKS TO LEGISLATE OUT OF EXISTENCE THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. AND NOT ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN FUELS OR FEELS THAT CAN UTILIZED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. CURRENTLY OUR ELECTRIC ELECTRICAL GRID IS NOT IN A POSITION TO POWERFULLY CLOSE TO THE SIZE. EVEN IF WE BUILT TWO TIMES THE OF THE- EXISTING POWER PLANTS. WE CANNOT HAVE THAT WE COULD NOT HAVE THE POWER TO SHOW THAT THIS LOW. TO NAME A CALIFORNIA LITTLE LEAGUE COME. FITTED CONTAINABLE FORWARD CREATE A BROADER SENSE OF LATE OF THIS LENS. TAKES TO ACCOUNT NEW FUELS BIOFUELS HYDROGEN. NATURAL GAS WHO KNOWS WHAT'S NEXT. FRIENDS AND I KNOW PEOPLE THAT I KNOW.

THANK YOU AS A- PROUD CO AUTHOR I WANTED TO- SAY SOME REMARKS ACCORDING THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. TWENTY NINETEEN STATE OF THE AIR REPORT CARD RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH MY DISTRICT IS AN RECEIVED AN F. GRADE- IN THAT REPORT IN THE SAME REPORT RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS IN THE TOP TEN COUNTIES FOR MOST AT RISK. OR YEAR ROUND PARTICULATE POLLUTION IN FACT ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA WAS FIFTEEN POINT 7% SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE'S FIFTEEN POINT FOUR PREVALENCE. SO ALL THIS IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. GIVEN THAT RIVERSIDE IS USED AS A MAJOR TRUCK FREIGHT AND COMMUTER CORRIDOR. POLLUTANTS FROM THESE EMISSIONS. POSE A GREATER HEALTH RISKS TO MY CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENTS. REDUCING DANGEROUS PARTICULATE MATTER BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES NOT ONLY BENEFITS RIVERSIDE WITH THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THE SOONER WE INCREASE MASS ADOPTION AND FORD ABILITY OF SAID VEHICLES THE BETTER. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO IN PALO ALTO. IN THIS BILL FOR AND I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE HI. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL. YES SIR THANK YOU A MANAGER MY FIRST. JUST QUESTION I'M LOOKING TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE NEVER SEEN THIS IN AN ANALYSIS BEFORE. THE TALKS ABOUT SUPPORTING AND CONCEPT. SO THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE THE NOW SO SHOULD BE ABOUT THE BILL NOT CONCEPTS I MEAN I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IN FACT I THINK. MANY OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF MAYBE NOT THE BILL. SO COULD COULD I GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON FROM THE AUTHOR OR FOR ME OR I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT SUPPORT AND CONCEPT. MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ANALYSIS. WELL I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF STAFF- BECAUSE I WORK WITH THEM ON BUT THE ANALYSIS WAS GOING TO SAY. AND BASICALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO CONTINUE FUNDING- SEVEN SEVEN SENTENCE. AND WHILE WE THINK THAT THIS BILL DOES HAVE- THERE ARE CONCERNS BUT WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION- SO THAT'S- KIND OF WHERE THE SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT RIGHT WE SEE THIS BILL AS BEING SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE WORKED ON AS IT MOVES THROUGH OUR HOUSE AND THROUGH THE SENATE. AND SO WE WERE JUST SUGGESTING THAT THE- AUTHOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO WORD OF LABOR TO WORK WITH KERR- TO TRY TO- FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY. TO APPROACH THIS VERY IMPORTANT GOAL OF CONTINUING TO FUND SEVEN CENTERS OKAY. GREAT JUST AS A MEMBER JUST ONE OTHER. BY MIKE MY CONCERN THAT WE START ABOUT SUPPORTING THINGS IN CONCEPT IT SHOULD REALLY BE ABOUT THE BILL ITSELF I DO AGAIN SUPPORT THE CONCEPT I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S PROBABLY DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN THE STATE. TO REDUCE MOBILE SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE I HAVE THE TWO PORTS. I SAW A MAJOR FREEWAY THAT RUNS THROUGH IT SO I WELL KNOW THEY NEED. TO CLEAN OUR AIR I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS BILL TO I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE NOTABLE HONOR TO IS ANOTHER REVIEWED. ARTICLE LISTED ON HER WHO TYPICALLY ARE STAKEHOLDERS IN DISCUSSIONS LIKE THESE AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. BUT I JUST THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE STAKEHOLDER INPUT. IN THIS EFFORT- SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AGAIN I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THE WORKING CLASSES THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT BY. THE KIND OF VEHICLES THIS TARGETS TO SOME EXTENT. AND I BELIEVE I WOULD MAKE THE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR ME. TO JUST TARGET THOSE HARDWORKING FOLKS BECAUSE THE TYPES OF VEHICLES THEY HAVE TO BUY ARE TYPICALLY. NO HEAVIER DUTY IF YOU WILL THAN A THAN JUST A SIMPLE PASSENGER VEHICLE. SO THAT I AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S- DESIRE TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I DO SUPPORT CONCEPT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AS WELL AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS- ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE VISION HE'S TRYING OUTLINED BUT- DOING SOMETHING THROUGH. A EXECUTIVE ORDER DOESN'T NECESSARILY. ALLOW THE DEBATE AND THE DISCUSSION AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SO I ACTUALLY THINK THE AUTHOR OR THE AUTHOR'S FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND I GUESS I. YEAH I HAVE A FOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE- TODAY I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS EVEN I BELIEVE CARP HAS LESS RESTRICTIVE- AVENUES OF GETTING TO THEIR GOALS AND IN THIS BILL I THINK IT'S BEEN EXPEDITED WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE 10% LOWER THAN THE BASELINE BETWEEN BETWEEN TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY NINE BUT THEN INSTEAD OF WHAT CARD RECOMMENDS THAT 40% THIS BILL JUMPS UP TO SIXTY PERCENT. FOR IT TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY FOUR SO IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR- HOW. REALISTIC THAT'S GONNA BE AND ALSO WHAT IMPACT- THAT ARE ARE GONNA BE FELT BECAUSE AS THE THAT AS MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE SPOKE FROM LONG BEACH THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT HOW. THE OLD TECHNOLOGY DOVE TAILS WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND IN THAT PROCESS YOU DON'T WANT THE BURDEN OF THAT COST BEING PASSED DOWN TO CONSUMERS- AND- IF THE IF MADAM CHAIR WILL ALLOW I HAVE A SECOND QUESTION AS WELL. LET THE AUTHOR RESPOND TO THIS ONE FIRST. SURE I THINK THAT THE QUESTION AS FAR AS THESE- THRESHOLD NUMBERS IN HERE VERSUS CARP AND THINK THAT CHANGE THE LAST FEW YEARS IF NOT MONTHS- SEVERAL LARGE AUTO MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING GENERAL MOTORS SAID A VERY LOFTY PLAN TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- NON INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS SIMPLY NOT. NOT TEN YEARS TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS THE THING OKAY DON'T JUST TELL US SHOW US AND GIVE IT'S A VERY WE THINK. QUANTIFIABLE MARKERS AND THE TENT BECAUSE IT ALSO SAYS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NEED TO BE 10% LOWER THAN BASELINE TO BASELINE IS NOT TODAY. WHEN THE BILL COMES IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THE BASS LINE IS TWENTY TWENTY FIRST ST GOING BACK TO TWENTY TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NEED TO BE TEN PERCENT. LOWER ANY CAN OVERALL EMISSIONS FROM YOUR FLEET. SO DON'T JUST TELL US SHOW US SHOWS THAT YOU'RE DOING AND STEPPING UP- I KNOW THE OPPOSITION TO RACISM ARGUMENT TO THIS IN THE IN THE LATER. YEARS AS WELL WE GO TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THREE THRESHOLD THE NUMBERS THAT WE'D BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE BUT THE GOAL HERE IS CALIFORNIA SHE REALLY PUSHED. THE INDUSTRY NOT TO JUST TELL US THEY'RE DOING THIS BUT REALLY HAVE SOME. QUANTIFIABLE MARKERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO- YOU KNOW OUR CLEANER GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS VERY TO ANOTHER QUESTION. I DO I- I THINK I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS FIRST ONE AS WELL BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP ALL THE TIME. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON- I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME- AND IMPACT FELT AMONG CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS THAT- WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF AND NO AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION. TO ALLOW THE NEW GENERATION OF FOLKS BECOME. CLEANER VEHICLE DRIVERS IS GONNA SUFFICE POTENTIALLY WITHIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS I. MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS BUT I JUST. MADE AND MAYBE I'M TRYING TO GET INTO THE WEEDS TOO MUCH BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUB GROUP THAT'S GOING TO BE. SEVERELY IMPACTED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED- LET ME JUST GET TO THE SECOND QUESTION. OF JUST TO CLARIFY BY THE WAY THERE THERE WILL BE PENALTIES FOR SELLING BUT NOT FOR PRODUCING. AND IF THAT'S CORRECT THAT SOMEONE. IN MY HUMBLE VIEW WEAKENS THE ARGUMENT OF WHERE WE STAND AS A STATE AS WELL SO I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD- BAND- PRODUCTION OUT RIGHT WORK PENALIZE THE PRODUCTION AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S THE JOB MARKET BUT BUT IT'S ALSO INTERESTING HOW WE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE WILLING TO. PENALIZE THE SELLING BUT NOT THE PRODUCTION SO IF YOU. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO COMMENT TO THOSE I. HAPPY TO TAKE IT. WITHOUT ANY MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YEAH THERE THERE'S A FEW THINGS THERE AS FAR AS THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS. WELL FIRST OF ALL WE HOPE THAT THIS PENALTY WILL NEVER COME TO FRUITION THERE IS A GREAT. S. ABILITY AND WE HOPE BY NUDGING. THE INDUSTRY TODAY WILL GIVE THEM A COUPLE YEARS TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE TO CREATE MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SOLD HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO JUST ON THE NATURAL HALF OF THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS WON'T HAVE THIS IMPACT AT ALL YOU KNOW THEY WOULD JUST BE BENEFIT LOAN CAN CONSUMERS WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ZERO MICHIGAN VEHICLES. AT A LOWER RATE OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REBATES OUT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY INCREASE THEY GET THE AMOUNTS TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE VIABLE TO FURTHER SUPPORT SPUR INTERESTED SO I THINK. IT'S THE OPPOSITE. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MANAGER I'D LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES FROM. THE GLENDALE. SANTA ANA SORRY YOUR GLENDALE. GREAT START I'D LIKE TO ECHO HIS SENTIMENTS- YOU KNOW I'M GLAD TO SEE. YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS I'M GLAD TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE TAKEN THE BALL BACK IN TERMS OF POLICY MAKING ESPECIALLY ON THESE BIG ISSUES THAT WERE GOING TO STRUGGLE. WITH TO MEET OUR CHRONICLES AND- I HAD TO SORT OF IN RELATED QUESTIONS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE SIMILAR- TO. WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM LONG BEACH WAS COMMENTING BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER. I MEAN THE FIRST ISSUE SORT OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CURSED ME IF WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A HIGH ADOPTION RATE OF SAYS- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. ESPECIALLY WITH MODELS OBSERVES THAT ARE MORE LIMITED IN TERMS OF THEIR RANGE- IS ADEQUATE AND UNDERPINNING THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE. PRODUCING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY ENOUGH ELECTRONS. AND THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT. IN A WAY THAT'S A POSITIVE IN TERMS OF GHG EMISSIONS FREE- PRODUCTION SOURCES AND- SITTING ON THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE FOR FOUR YEARS I'M NOT SURE THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. I'M SKEPTICAL THAT WE DO SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS. HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN HAS BEEN STUDIED. IS THERE SOME SORT OF STUDY OR SOMETHING SOMETHING TO POINT TO SUGGEST. WHERE AT IN THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE A LARGE SCALE ADOPTION OBSERVES. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS SHORTER. IS HAS THERE BEEN A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON. ON PRICE AND THEREFORE IMPACT ON- ACCESS TO VEHICLES FOR THE FOR WORKING CLASS MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW JUST LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ECONOMICS IF YOU CAPRICORNUS IN PARTICULAR THING. YOU TEND TO DRIVE THE COST OF THAT THING UP. AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF ANALYSIS OF THAT. THAT'S WHAT THE FIRST QUESTION ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE THIS TODAY AND HAD A TENFOLD INCREASE BY NEXT YEAR. IT WOULD BE A DISASTER WHICH IS WHY I THINK THAT. IF HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS NOW WE'RE SAYING BY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY FOUR. YOU WANT TO BE SIXTY PERCENT. GREATER THAN WHAT WE WERE. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO THE ROUGHLY 50% IMPROVEMENT IN TEN YEARS. I THINK TEN YEARS GIVES US ALL A GOOD TIME TO INCREASE. OUR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS A SERIOUS INVESTMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OF CHARGING STATIONS. I KNOW I HAD THE BILL THERE'S MULTIPLE OTHERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AFTER FOR THAT GOAL THEIR THERE ARE ARE NOT ENOUGH. BUT IF PEOPLE WE NEED IT CHARGING STATIONS FOLLOW THE AMOUNT OF VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT NOT. PROBABLY ENOUGH THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO RAMP UP. AS FAR AS THE OVERALL COST I THINK THAT'S JUST A RED HERRING EUROPE POLICY IF YOU LOOK. AT HOW THIS BILL WOULD WORK. THERE ARE SOME AUTO MANUFACTURERS UNLIKE AND NAME THEM HE BY NO THERE'S IT HALF A DOZEN- SO IT. THAT ARE ON THEIR- GUARANTEED TO NOT HAVE TO MEET THIS THRESHOLD AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SELLING CARS AT THE LOWER END. OF THE COST RAPTURE THAT ARE AT PAR WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE SEDAN. AS WELL LETTER STATES. AND IT'S THE SAME PRICE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T TO PAY FOR GAS. RIGHT SO IT'S EVEN LOWER SO TO SAY THAT'S GONNA WAS GONNA BE. MORE EXPENSIVE. FOR WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS I THINK THE OFFICE LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND HAVE TO COMMUTE TO THE BAY AREA. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A HUGE COST FOR THEM. AND RIGHT NOW THAT DID THAT I DON'T KNOW THE WHITE INDIVIDUAL MORE PEOPLE ARE DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE. LARGE PART TWO IS IT'S- THE REBATES AREN'T ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND IS ON A CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT AS WE MOVE ALONG. THAT'S GOING TO COMMUNITY INCREASE AND IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN CHEAPER AND IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR BERMAN. THANK YOU- ADAM CHANNEL I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO AND I'M CALLING FROM RIVERSIDE- FOR A JOINT OFFERING THIS IS REALLY GOOD BILL AND ONE OF- FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF POINTS IN QUESTIONS OF AND REYES THE FIRST TO MAKE CLEAR THAT. IT IT WILL BE THE OB- THE MANUFACTURER IS THE ONE THAT WOULD PAY A FEE- SO THE SO THE FEET OR THEY SHOULD BE THE PENALTY- IF THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS THE MANUFACTURER WHO WOULD PAY THAT PENALTY BUT BUT LIKE- THE AUTHOR SAID. HOPEFULLY A LOT OF MANUFACTURERS NEVER PAY THIS PENALTY- AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EFFORTS OF ALL THE MAKERS AND THAT'S REALLY FRAME THE WAY THAT WE VIEW THIS BILL SEVERAL OF THE LARGEST AUTOMAKERS AND THE OTHERS SPOKE TO A COUPLE THEM AS ONE PLUS IS OUT A LITTLE BIT. I PLEDGE TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWO YEARS AGO VOLVO ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANNED TO MAKE ALL OF YOUR CARS 50% OF GLOBAL SALES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. EARLIER THIS YEAR THEY DOUBLE DOWN AND SAID THAT THEY WILL MAKE ONLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRD BEFORE THE. THE THIS BILL WOULD WOULD YEAH. WE DON'T GET THIRTY. LOWER THAN BASELINE SAYING THEY CAN BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. IN JANUARY GENERAL MOTORS PLEDGED TO STOP MAKING GASOLINE POWERED. PASSENGER CARS VANS AND SUVS. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THEN FORD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD INVEST TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. EARLIER THIS YEAR VOLKSWAGEN ANNOUNCED THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY. IT'S EXPECTED THAT 50% OF ITS VEHICLE SALES IN THE U. S. WILL BE FOR ELECTRIC. ALONG WITH 70% OF SALES. IN EUROPE SO MANY FACTORS ARE ALREADY MOVING DOWN THIS PATH. AND SO YEAH THOSE MANUFACTURERS. ASSUMING THEY MEET THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE PUBLICLY STATED. WON'T PAY. ANY PENALTY AT ALL. ACTIONS LIKE THESE ARE PROOF THAT THE BILL'S GOAL OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUTURE. ISN'T JUS ASPIRATIONAL BUT IT IS REALISTIC AND ACHIEVABLE. IN THE BILL SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ACTIONS ANNOUNCED. BY AUTO MAKERS ALREADY. JUST MAKE BUT JUST MAKING MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF CONCISELY SUMMED UP THE CHALLENGE IN THE BILL ANALYSIS. NOTING THAT AND I QUOTE. EXPONENTIAL GROWTH WILL REQUIRE A STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE VEHICLE SALES. THROUGH STANDARDS IMPOSED ON AUTO MANUFACTURERS INCENTIVES. TO ENTICE CONSUMERS. AND TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF CHARGING AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE I AGREE. WITH THE CONCERN AROUND THAT BUT- YEAH WE CAN'T SAY WE EXPECT. YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY THIRTY FOUR WHY IS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ALREADY EXIST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE A BIG BIG- ROBUST PLANS TO MEET THE EEVEE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH STATE FUNDED A FEDERALLY FUNDED. PRIVATE ECTOR FUNDED- TO MEET THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOALS THAT WE'VE SET. SO THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY ALONG WITH THE AUTOMAKER'S PLEDGES. BUT IT TAKES THE NECESSARY NEXT STEPS. TO INCENTIVIZE THE SALE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- SO I- HUMBLY. ASKING HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME IN VOTING YES. ON AB TWELVE EIGHTY. THANK YOU A VICE CHAIR UPON. I THANK YOU THAT MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR I GUESS IS THAT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S COMPETING OR CONFLICTING GOALS IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION- ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE WE'RE HEARING FROM THE MANUFACTURERS THAT SAY THAT THEY WANT TO PRODUCE MORE THAT. WHICH IS A POSITIVE THING AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'RE IMPOSING A PENALTY ON ON A CURRENTLY LEGAL PRODUCT- THE GAS- POWERED VEHICLES AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAY WELL WE HOPE THAT PENALTIES WOULD NEVER BE IMPOSED BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND EASE WE NEED YOUR RAISING REVENUE FOR SAT PROGRAMS TO SUBSIDIZE THE PURCHASE. OF THAT SO IF YOU NEVER IMPOSE THE PENALTIES YOU WOULD YOU WOULDN'T GENERATE THE REVENUE TO SUBSIDIZE THE PURCHASE OF VEHICLES AND THE MAIN FACTORS ALREADY DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. SO I GUESS MAYBE CAN YOU CLARIFY KIND OF YEAH. HOW THIS ALL PIECES TOGETHER. YEAH THAT'S NOT I'LL JUST TRY TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE WE WANT THEM TO GO FASTER. AND STICK TO THEIR PROMISE THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE IN TIME. WE'RE SAYING OKAY WE WANT TO MEMORIALIZE YOUR COMMITMENT. AND HAVE YOU HAVE SOME REASONABLE- MARKERS IN THE NEXT. THREE FIVE AND ROUGHLY TEN YEARS. THAT THAT LOCK IN THOSE ARE THOSE RATES AND IF YOU DON'T REACH THOSE GOALS. GOING TO- RECOGNIZE THAT AND USE. AND HAVE- YOU KNOW A FINANCIAL TOOL TO BASICALLY. IT HAPPENED HAVE IS THEY HAVE A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAY LUCK YOU'RE PRODUCING MORE AND MORE GROWTH POLLUTING CARS AND NINE A- CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN CARS IN CALIFORNIA SOON AND WHEN THEY USE THE MONEY FOR IT FROM THAT ACTION AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING CLEAN CARS IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST PLACE SO. WE THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND ALLOW THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT JUST DON'T DO IT JUST DON'T FORCE US TO DO IT AS FAST IS ACTUALLY. AND WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AS FAR AS THE SPEED IN THE DIRECTION AS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GO IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS BUT ESSENTIALLY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS MISTER VICE CHAIR. IS CALIFORNIA COULD STAND BACK AND SAY OKAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO WAIT HERE IN TEN YEARS AND SEE IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS OR WE COULD COME UP WITH A WASTED TRIP TO REALLY PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. SOME FEEL GOOD THING AN ALTRUISTIC THING ABOUT CLEAN CARS AS MY COLLEAGUE FOR FIRMS IT'S AN EMPIRE SAID THIS IMACT PEOPLE'S LIVES YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S REGRESSIVE IN YOUR AREA TO THAT POOR AIR SO IN LOWER INCOME AREAS THAT'S A BIG IMPACT NOT JUST CLIMATE CHANGE FOR ALL OF US WILD FIRES IN THE IMPACT OF. ALL OF THAT BUT HOW IT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY. TO LIVE OUR LIVES TO BE ABLE TO BREATHE CLEANER. I AYE SIR PREFER THE ANSWER I GET. IF I COULD. IF I COULD I GUESS WHAT I GATHERED FROM THAT IS THAT. YOU DON'T BULLARD. YOU ARE THE AUTHOR AND MAY BE THE YEAR COLLEAGUES TO A CO AUTHOR YOU LEAVE AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN FACTORS ARE MOVING FAST ENOUGH. IS THAT IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO. PUT SOME TYPE OF PENALTY IF THEY DON'T MOVE FAST YEAH WE WANNA LAAKIIN SON SOME PRODUCTION- GUIDELINES AND MARKERS- BUT ALSO NOT ALL AUTO MANUFACTURERS ARE STEPPING UP LIKE VOLVO AND GENERAL MOTORS AND HAVING CLEAR AND CONCISE GOALS OF WHERE THEY WANT TO GET BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WELL I MEAN I IT'S CERTAINLY HAS MENTIONED BEFORE ME THE GOALS OF THE GOALS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATORS SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN SHAPING THEM- VERSES THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER. ACT I JUST ACT I'LL ALSO I'M I'M GRAPPLING WITH JUST THE CONFLICTING- PERSPECTIVE WITHIN THE BILL BUT I CERTAINLY- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- YOUR WORK BUT- I PROBABLY PUT THE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO SPEAK. WELL I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING A VERY ROBUST AND VERY. I THINK IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. ABOUT THIS BILL AND ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE. THE GOALS THAT WE ALL SHARE OF CLEANER AIR AND MOVING TO IS THAT FUTURE. AND I DO THINK THAT- THE DISCUSSIONS ALSO REVEALED- THE- THE STRENGTH OF THE BILL. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE DESIRE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A HAND. IN THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOUT- THIS IS ROLLED OUT. A RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE LOFTY GOALS ARE SET BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM BUT- WE ALSO. NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE MECHANICS OF HOW TO DO THAT AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT- BUT ALSO LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILLS- ABILITY. TO DO THAT AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN. THE IDEA OF HAVING A FUNDING SOURCE FOR INCENTIVES THAT AT LEAST AT THIS POINT WE NEED. FOR A LOT OF OUR CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE APPS. AND THESE BILLS ALSO STATED GOAL OF NOT ACTUALLY HAVING TO HAVE FINES. I THINK THAT THAT IS A- BIT OF A- DILEMMA WITHIN THE BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED- AND- YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE GOAL REALLY IS THE C. B. R. P. FUNDING I THINK THAT THIS. WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL TO REALLY MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT'S CLEAR AND THAT DOESN'T DO ANY DAMAGE TO A- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO BUY ZAPS- IF IT IS TO. SPEED UP THE PROCESS. YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AS WELL AND I AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS. THAT WE DO NEED TO SPEED THAT PROCESS UP WE THE PLANET CAN'T WAIT. EVEN TEN YEARS IS TOO LONG. THIS IS THE VEHICLE THAT'S IN FRONT OF US THAT WE HAVE IN THE ASSEMBLY. DISCUSS THESE REALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE BILL DOES PASS OUT. BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT THE AUTHORS. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. WITH THE COLORS THAT THAT PHONE IN TODAY I APPRECIATE THEM PHONING IT I THINK THEY HAVE IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE. AND I WILL I WOULD URGE THE AUTHORS TO SIT DOWN WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. WITH CARVED WITH THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS. WITH OF ORGANIZED LABOR.OF WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS. TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AND TO BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS. AND I HOPE THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS. LABOR AND EVERYONE ELSE IS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHORS. AND TO HELP CRAFT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT REALLY ACHIEVES EVERYBODY'S GOALS HERE. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION I WOULD LOVE TO. TO BE HELPFUL TO YOU AS WELL. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL. DOES HAVE ALL A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE OFFICE HAVEA LOT OF WORK TO DO. I DID WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. MOTION AND A SECOND- WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL FOR THIS. THE MOTION TO PASS TO THE- I'M SORRY I DID NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSE AND- I WOULD INVITE YOU MISTER MCCARTY TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORDS AND SAY YES I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND YOUR TEAM WORK ON THIS AND- JUST. I THINK IT OUGHT LOTS BEEN SAID I THOUGHT TAKE MY CLOTHES FROM SO MY JOINT AUTHORS. BUT IS ONE ISSUE I WANTED TO ADDRESS WHEN THE A LOT WE DIDN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT. THE OPPOSITION. FROM THE BUILDING TRADES. I WISH WE COULD TALK ABOUT ONE ISSUE. OF THE OF THE PRICE OF THESE CARS WITH ANOTHER ON THEIR UNAFFORDABLE FOR TOO MANY LOWER. INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND I. THINK THAT'S A FALLACY WE TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT THEY'RE BIGGER ISSUE WHICH I TOTALLY CONCUR AND WE NEED TO RECONCILE THAT. IS GONNA TALK ABOUT THEIR LETTER IS THE REVENUE STREAM. REVENUE STREAM TO FIX OUR ROADS YOU LOOK ON THE FREEWAYS AROUND HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TO MASSIVE FIVE YEAR PROJECTS. TO FIX OUR OUR ROADS ARE FREEWAYS AROUND- THE CAPITAL CITY. AND IF WE DO HAVE A DECLINING. A REVENUE SOURCE WITH GAIL GAS GAS SALES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT WILL WE ADAPTED SB ONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE DID INCREASE THE FEE WOULD CALL THE TEST AS THE FIRST DAY. OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND IF THIS IS HAPPENING ANYWAY LOOK IT SAYS. SOMETHING LIKE THIS ISSUE. BUT THEY SHOULD SOMEONE TALK TO THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS THEY'RE DOING THIS ANYWAY. WE'RE JUST SPEEDING IT UP. AND SO AS WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD. NO PUN INTENDED WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE FUNDING FOR OUR ROADS. CONSTRUCTION ARE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR FUN FOR THESE GREAT CONSTRUCTION JOBS BUT ALSO REALLY. ARE SO IMPORTANT TO. OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT BASED UPON. A GAS SALES THAT BASED UPON- THE FEE ON THE ON THE AUTOMOBILES IF THEIR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE OR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE SO. I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING YOU SAID IN YOUR COMMENTS I CONCUR WITH. AS FAR AS CONTINUING TO IT TO FLUSH OUT THESE ISSUES AND WE HAVE. HAD FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INDUSTRY BE CAN. TO DO SO. AND I ASK HERE I THANK YOU. OKAY WITHOUT ROLL CALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO PROVIDE FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN HI FONG. SORRY SEVEN NO ONE AND NO BERMAN. BERMAN HI CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM NO DALY DALY NO DAVIES DAVIES NO GIPSON KALRA. THREE HI PLEASE I MEDINA. MEDINA I NAZARIAN THIS AREA AND I WENT. O'DONNELL WARD FOUR I WICKS WICKS I WILL IS. SEVEN FOR OKAY WE'LL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN PERHAPS A MEMBERS I'M GOING TO PASS THE GAVEL. TO MY VICE CHAIR OF THE PERCENT. WE WILL NOW HEAR FIVE NINE AB FORTY THREE NINE THREE MAYES BEGIN WHATEVER YOU READY THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS BILLIS BEEN THREE YEARS NOW IN THE MAKING OF THIS IS A BILL THAT PRIMARILY LOOKS AT WAYS OF REDUCING OF GIVING CITIES THE FLEXIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CAPS SPEED LIMITS. TO REDUCE TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN TRAFFIC INJURIES. THANK YOU WE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THIS BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- AND CHAIRED THE DENTURE FRAZIER. INSTEAD ASSETS TO CONVENE A TASK FORCE WHICH IN HINDSIGHT WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY REALLY SMART THING TO DO BECAUSE WE PUT TOGETHER A TASK FORCE OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAD TRIPLE A WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAD THE SAFE STREETS ADVOCATES HE REALLY BROUGHT EVERYONE TOGETHER FROM URBAN AREAS FROM RURAL AREAS. AND FOUND. THAT SPEED IS A PROBLEM THAT'S KILLING PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS ASKING FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM THE VERY RIGID RULES THAT SET SPEED LIMITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BASICALLY THAT IN ORDER TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS CITIES HAVE TO DO A TRAFFIC SURVEY VERY TEN YEARS. THEN THEY HAVE TO SET THEIR SPEED LIMITS AT THE EIGHTY THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF HOW FAST PEOPLE ARE DRIVING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE SPEEDING. THIS FORCES CITIES TO CONSTANTLY RAISE SPEED LIMITS REDUCED RESULTING IN A KIND OF SPEED CREEP REGARDLESS OF THE WISHES OF THEIR RESIDENTS TO CONTROL SPEEDING ON OFTEN RESIDENTIAL STREETS. LAST YEAR DURING CODED WE HAD A- 13% DROP IN THE MILES THAT WERE DRIVEN IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STAYING HOME. WHAT HAPPENED IN TERMS OF FATALITIES HOWEVER AND INJURIES WITH A 24% INCREASE IN THE PER MILE DEFINITELY. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST EVER JUMP IN NINETY SIX YEARS. BECAUSE WITH LESS CARS ON THE ROAD PEOPLE DROVE FASTER AND EVERY MILE AN HOUR FASTER PEOPLE GO THE RATE OF INJURY AND DEATH GOES UP ALMOST EXPONENTIALLY. THIS IS ONE PIECE OF THE TRAFFIC SAFETY PUZZLE BUT A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PIECE. WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY ON A. B. FORTY THREE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- WITH ME TODAY I HAVE SALUTE SO LEADER RENTALS FROM LA DOT AND BRIAN TAYLOR. FROM UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO DISCUSS THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND ASK ANY ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS GREAT. OPERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE LINE FOR SELENA. GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SELENA RENTAL GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FORTY THREE LED O. T. SAFETY IS OUR NORTH STAR OUR HIGHEST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO IMPROVE SAFETY FOR ALL ROAD USERS WHETHER THEY DRIVE WALK BIKE OR SCOOT NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE KILLED IN CRASHES EACH YEAR MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT OR SEVERELY INJURED SPEED IS THE NUMBER ONE DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE SEVERITY OF THE CRASH JUST FIVE MILES AN HOUR CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. PUT BLUNTLY SPEED KILLS LA DOTD WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS STATE STREET DESIGN BUT ELIMINATING TRAFFIC FATALITIES REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THE STATUS QUO IS A FAILED STRATEGY THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR VEHICLE PERFORMANCE RELIES ON STRANGE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES AND RESULT IN INCREASING SPEED LIMITS WITH NO END IN SIGHT. AB FORTY THREE OPPORTUNITIES AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROTECT ALL ROAD USERS BY LETTING US ESTABLISH SIXTY ONE IS OUR STREETS CURRENT LAW COURSES CITIES TO SET THE LIMITS THAT MATCH DRIVER BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF BRINGING THAT BEHAVIOR IN LINE WITH SIXTY GOALS BROKE WITH CONDITIONS AND A LOT IT FORCES US TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A STREET THAT IS TOO FAST AND A STREET THAT IS UNENFORCEABLE THAT'S WHAT FORCES CITIES TO INCREASE SPEED LIMITS DESPITE THE TRAGIC PATTERN OF SEVERE INJURIES AND DEATHS ARE TOO MANY OF OUR STREET. BECAUSE OF THIS LAW WE HAVE REDUCED THE SPEED LIMIT ON NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILES OF LA STREET OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS REGARDLESS OF CHANGING STREET DESIGN EIGHTY FORTY THREE WILL GET THE RESPECTABILITY IS THAT IMPORTS WILL BE ONE OF THE PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS ARE DEADLY STREETS AROUND SCHOOLS AND SENIOR CENTERS IN AREAS OF HIGH BUSINESS ACTIVITY WHERE MORE PEOPLE ARE WALKING. EIGHTY FORTY THREE WILL SAVE LIVES AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES MY CHIEF ENGINEER DAN MITCHELL AND I WILL REMAIN ON THE LINE. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL NOW THAT A BRA TAYLOR- YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD ACTORS MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BRIGHT TAYLOR FOR OF PLANNING PUBLIC POLICY AND OF THE INSTITUTE CASH COULD STUDIES THE UC. SETTING UP SPEED ON ROADWAYS REQUIRED BALANCING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF VEHICLE MOVEMENT ON ONE HAND. AGAINST THE GREATER SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN ACTIVITY COSTA BASSMAN TRAFFIC ON THE OTHER. DRIVERS AND COMMERCIAL SHIPPERS TYPICALLY FAVOR FASTER LIMITS THOSE LIVING WALKING BIKING OR PLAYING IN PROXIMITY TO ROSE UP AND WENT SLOWER ONES. HOWEVER THE MOST COMMON METHOD FOR SETTING SPEED LIMITS LEAD TO DRIVERS TO COLLECTIVELY DECIDE HOW FAST IS TOO FAST. THE LONG ESTABLISHED. TRAFFIC ON THE ROADWAY AFTER THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT AND THEN SETTING THE LIMIT AT A FIVE MILE AN HOUR INCREMENTS CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF WHICH 85% OF THE VEHICLES TRAVEL. THE WORLD WAS BORN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND FORTIES IN THE LOGIC THAT MOST DRIVERS OPERATED SAY SPEEDS MOST OF THE TIME. AND IT SEEMS THAT ABOUT 15% OF THE DRIVERS DRIVE FOR FASTER THAN THEY SHOULD. RESEARCHERS IN THE UCLA STUDENT TRANSPORTATION SPENDING THEM HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND FOUNDED EARLY ARCHITECTS CONSIDERED A REASONABLE. POINT FOR SETTING SPEED LIMITS PRIMARILY IN RURAL AREAS SUBJECT TO FOLLOW UP SAFETY EVALUATIONS IMPOSSIBLE. JUST BUT OTHER TIME THIS. STAR POINT OF A INTO A HARD. WILL PERCENT. WHICH IS NOW BUT IT'S A- INTEND. THE EIGHTY FIFTY. RULED A TIME WHEN THE MAIN GOAL OF ST. AND WHICH AND BOAT TRAFFIC FLOWS INTO. BUT THE MOTOR. USE OFF THE STREET. AND ON THIS. IN THE BUILDING.
