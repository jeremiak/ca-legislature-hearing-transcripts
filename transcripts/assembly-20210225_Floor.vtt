00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.635
I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.939
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.340
I WAS A YOUNG GIRL GOING

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:17.908

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.811

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:24.081
PARK SWIMMING PROGRAM I MYSELF

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.683
COMING FROM A FAMILY OF TEN

00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:28.219
A LATINO FAMILY NONE OF US

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:30.487
KNEW HOW TO SWIM AND BECAUSE

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.590
MY MOTHER DID NOT KNOW HOW TO

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:35.226
SWIM SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:38.796
THAT WE WOULD LEARN TO SWIM

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:41.665
SO WE WALKED OVER TO THIS PARK

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:43.634

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:52.109
WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.246
THERE WAS A WATER POLO TEAM

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.480

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:03.520
NOT A WOMEN'S WATER POLO TEAM

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.189
