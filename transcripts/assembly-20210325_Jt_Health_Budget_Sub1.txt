BEFORE WE START I JUST I THINK AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR LIFE FOR ANYONE APOLOGIZE THAT- THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OF DOING ALL THESE THINGS ARE NOT BEING IN THIS ROOM AS OFTEN AS WE USED TO ACTUALLY- DR RIDICULOUS COMMENTS. PROBABLY DIDN'T COME THROUGH BECAUSE I HAD HIS MICROPHONE TURNED OFF I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT TOO I MIGHT TREASURY WAS A COLLEAGUE SO. BUT SHE'S. DO YOU WANT TO SAY THANK NOW HE'S RIGHT WE'RE READY TO GO NOW OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M STILL IN ALIGNMENT WITH- ONE OF THE MAIN- CALLIN GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF KIND STANDARDIZING AND SIMPLIFYING ACROSS MEDIC CAL DH CS IS PROPOSING TO REQUIRE ALL MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THEIR HEALTH PLANS OF CONTRACTORS TO BE NCQA ACCREDITED BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX I HIGHLIGHT THE ON THE HEALTH PLAN A SUBCONTRACTORS PART BECAUSE AT THIS TIME THE DEPARTMENT ISN'T PROPOSING A TO GO DOWN TO THE- IPA OR PROVIDER OF LEVEL IN REGARDS TO THOSE THAT TAKE RISK- SOMETHING FOR US TO EXPLORE IN THE FUTURE BUT AT THIS TIME OUR PROPOSALS. FOCUSED AROUND HEALTH PLANS THE CONTRACTORS. I'M IN ALTHOUGH THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX DH CS DOES BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD NOT BE DEFERRED TO A LATER DATE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PLANS THE NECESSARY TIME. I REALLY TO PREPARE FOR A MEETING THE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS ADDITIONALLY I NEED TO BE CLEAR IN OUR UPCOMING AS CARE FOR KERR PROCUREMENT GOING ON THIS YEAR- THAT WE WOULD HAVE THIS EXPECTATION IN CALIFORNIA SO ANYONE. RESPONDING TO THAT PROCUREMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE NCQA ACCREDITED IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN MEDICAID- BY THAT TWENTY TWENTY SIX TIME PERIOD. NCQA ACCREDITATION PROVIDES AN INDUSTRY ACCEPTED ACCREDITATION STANDARD IN SIX MAIN AREAS- THAT INCLUDES QUALITY IMPROVEMENT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT NETWORK MANAGEMENT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT CREDENTIALING AND RE CREDENTIALING- AND MEMBER EXPERIENCE. I WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT HERE MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE CALAIS POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH NCQA REQUIREMENTS AND THEN OF COURSE WITH OUR PROPOSAL IN CALENDAR DOES GO ABOVE AND BEYOND SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN NCQA ACCREDITATION. BUT USES IT AS A FOUNDATION AND BASE FOR MANY OF THOSE COMPONENTS. NCQA ACCREDITATION ALSO PROVIDES THE BEST PLATFORM TO INCREASE STANDARDIZATION ACROSS MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND AFFORD ALL PLANS WITH A VERY CONSISTENT FOUNDATION OF QUALITY BEST PRACTICES. TWENTY SIX OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRE NCQA ACCREDITATION OF THEIR CONTRACTED MEDICAID HEALTH PLANS- OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR FULL SCOPE MEDICAL HEALTH PLANS IN A CALIFORNIA- SEVENTEEN CURRENTLY HAVE NCQA ACCREDITATION SO HUGE NUMBER OF THEM ALREADY HAVE THIS ACCREDITATION TODAY. HEALTH PLANS THAT PROVIDE PRIVATE COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO BE ACCREDITED BY NCQA- OR OTHER ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL SO REALLY LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL OF OUR- OUR BEER YES AB. ADD ENTITIES IN PAIRS. ABOUT REQUIRING NCQA ACCREDITATION OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND FOLLOWING THE NCQA FRAMEWORK DH CS IS GOALS TO REALLY TO INCREASE THAT SANDERS ASIAN ACROSS THE STATE TO REDUCE REDUNDANCIES. IN VARIOUS PROCESS SEASON ASSESSMENTS PARTICULAR LEE AND REALLY- THE CARE COORDINATION PIECES AS WELL AND BY BRIDGING SOME OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES IN NCQA. NCQA HAS ALSO BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER RECENTLY IN REGARDS TO REALLY FORGING FORWARD IN REGARDS TO EQUITY WORK AS WELL AS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CALIFORNIA ABOUT HOW TO EVEN IMPROVE SOME OF THE NCQA PIECES AROUND CARE COORDINATION- COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PIECES THAT REALLY ALIGNED WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SEE THEM AS THAT IS A GOOD PARTNER MOVING FORWARD. THE ACS DOES NOT RECOMMEND ALLOWING ACCREDITATION OR MONITORING BY AN ALTERNATIVE SO NON NCQA ENTITY IN OUR PROPOSAL- OF COURSE UNLESS THE HEALTH PLAN DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE NCQA ACCREDITATION BASED ON SIZE OR SCOPE. OF THE MEMBER POPULATION BECAUSE NCQA IS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR HEALTH PLAN ACCREDITATION WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD BE MANY IN CALIFORNIA- THAT WOULD NOT MEET THAT STANDARD BASED ON THE SIZE OF MEDIC AL HOWEVER JUST NOTING THAT- EXCEPTION POTENTIALLY. WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE CS- IS KERR ASSESSING WHETHER WE WOULD ALLOW CERTAIN APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS FROM. THE DEPARTMENT ANNUAL MEDICAL COMPLIANCE AUDIT TO BE EVALUATED ON RESULTS OF NCQA ACCREDITATION- THIS IS TYPICALLY. SEEN AS DEEMING- OR TALK ABOUT AS AS DEEMING- AS YOU ARE PROBABLY VERY WHERE DH YES CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR NCQA DEEMING AND CREDENTIALING ARE TODAY- FOR THE- SERVICES FOR THE PLAN TO OUR NCQA ACCREDITED OF COURSE- HOWEVER. IN THE FUTURE BEFORE DH YES WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY DEEMING WITHIN THE PROCESS WE WOULD ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE I TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT AROUND WHAT WE WERE IN OR NOT. I DEEMING IN REGARDS NCQA. HOWEVER I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE THAT DH CS IS NOT CONSIDERING REPLACING ANY OF OUR OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS- WITH NCQA ACCREDITATION. A LAW DOES ALLOW FOR A STANDARD ACROSS ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS. OF THAT WE DO NOT SEE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY IN REGARDS TO DEPARTMENT OVERSIGHT. INCLUDING REVIEWING ALL OUTCOMES NCQA ACCREDITATION- AND REALLY WE SEE IT AS AN ENHANCEMENT TO THE DARK DEPARTMENTS CURRENT. OVERSIGHT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. I SO REALLY STATED A PREVIOUS THAT IS NOT INTENDING TO KIND OF CBO OVERSIGHT- AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL GO ON TO OUR NEXT OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING NOW BEEN JOHNSON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- JUST HAVE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS HERE TODAY FIRST JUST WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF NCQA ACCREDITATION- AND POTENTIALLY REDEEMING THE FINDINGS OF THE WAY THAT STREAMLINE AND STANDARDIZE OVERSIGHT OF. MEDICAL MANAGED CARE- DO A ALLOWING FORTY MAYBE COULD REDUCE REGULATORY BURDEN ON MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WHILE ALSO FREEING UP G. H. U. S. WORKLOAD TO POCUS ON OTHER ACTIVITIES- ONE- ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE WELL- DIRECTOR COOPER NOTED THAT- ABOUT ABOUT HALF OF ALL STATES ARE REQUIRED TO Q. EIGHT CREDIT ASIAN- WE LOOKED INTO HOW MANY DO YOU CAN. DO YOUR STREAMING AND IT WAS ABOUT HALF OF THE STATES THAT REQUIREMENTS HE CUTE A CREDIT ATION- ALLEN DO YOU DEEM- TO THE FINDINGS THAT DETERMINE THAT THOSE ITEMS MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE MEETING STATE AND FEDERAL STANDARDS. JUST REYES ARE SEVERAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION- FIRST ALBUM THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL WHICH WOULD GIVE DHS AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHICH IF ANY- STATE AND FEDERAL STANDARDS- IT WOULD P. HIM AND THAT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE ROLE WOULD BE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE OVER SUCH DECISIONS- SECOND. MINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED- OF DETAIL ON THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF REQUIRING ACCREDITATION WHICH COULD INCLUDE NEW COMPLIANCE COSTS UP FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ULTIMATELY COULD BE REFLECTED IN THEIR CAPITATED RATES. AND SIMILARLY THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES EVEN COULD POTENTIALLY BE SORT OF RE DIRECTED- OR- FREED UP IF THAT CERTAIN STANDARDS WERE TO BE DEEMED TO NCQA- AND THEN BURKE JUST HAVE OUT WE ONLY HAVE A PRELIMINARY UNDERSTANDING STILL OF- OF HOW. NCQA ACCREDITATION STANDARDS THAT REALLY SORT OF PRECISELY TO STATE'S. AND- SO WHICH ON SURE IT UNCLEAR IF. SO OF WHICH STATE AND FEDERAL RULES BE OF A FACT DONE. TO THE ACROSS BODY. I DON'T AND THEN JUST LET WE JUST SORT OF PICK IT IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DELEGATING YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANT STATE OVERSIGHT- RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR THAN TODAY THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. CHISORA CATHERINE BARRESI. HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- MY NAME IS KEVIN BROPHY ON THE RECORD CARE COORDINATION FOR PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA- PARTICIPATE THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZED HELP AT THAT THEM NOT SERVE OUR PRIMARILY FOURTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND REALLY AIMED AT IMPROVING THE LIVES AND THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT OUR MEMBERS AND BENEFICIARIES WITH THE- PARTNERSHIP WITH ACTUALLY RECENTLY AWARDED NCQA ACCREDITATION IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE NCQA ACRONYM THAT STANDS FOR THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE- IT'S A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN EVALUATING- HEALTH CARE AND- EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS NATIONALLY- PARTNERSHIP DECIDED TO PUT. TWO AND TWO C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;-&lt;/c&gt;</u> BECAUSE ITS MISSION AND VALUES ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH PARTNERSHIP MISSIONS AND VALUES- AND LOOKING AT A CONFERENCE A FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST US IN ACHIEVING OPTIMAL- QUALITY FOR OUR MEMBERS AND PROVIDERS- AS WELL AS CONFUSING- EVALUATION AND MEASUREMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR OWN OPERATIONS- ANOTHER FACTOR THAT PLAYED INTO PARTNERSHIPS DECISION FOR PURSUING ANTI Q. WAY- WITH THAT WE OBVIOUSLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR ANNUAL I SEE THIS COLLECTION ACTIVITIES- AND BOTH THE CUTEST- PROGRAMMATIC WORK WITH NCQA AND THEIR ACCREDITATION PROCESS REALLY DO GO HAND IN HAND- WITH SUPPORTING- REALLY ALL AREAS OF QUALITY WITHIN HEALTH CARE- HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. AN ACTUAL HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES THAT PATIENTS. EXPERIENCE IN THEIR LIVES- IT IS MORE MENTIONING HOWEVER THAT FOR MEN CARE OR NO YET AND YOUR CREDIT AND I. COOPER NOTED THERE- ARE ABOUT- SEVEN OR SO THE ARE NOT THERE YET IN CALIFORNIA- THAT CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED- PREEMPTIVELY IN ORDER TO PURSUE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A PLAN JUST DECIDES TO DO OVERNIGHT AFTER PARTNERSHIP IT WAS ACTUALLY A FIVE YEAR PLANNING. PROCESS AND A DEDICATED PROCESS THAT EVERYBODY WITHIN OUR ORGANISATION- HAD TO STAY COMMITTED TO- WHAT I SPEAK TO THAT BECAUSE CURRENTLY WITH AN ANTI CURATORS ACTUALLY OVER SIXTY SIX FACTORS- WITH SUB ELEMENT BENEATH THAT THAT PLANTS HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THESE KEY AREAS IN A PATH. UP FULL OR PARTIAL PERFORMANCE IN ORDER TO. ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ACCREDITATION- WHAT'S INTERESTING THOUGH IS IT'S NOT JUST THE OPERATIONAL BENCHMARKS AND DEMONSTRATION IT'S ACTUALLY AN OVERALL ANALYSIS AND ONGOING FRAMEWORK- PLAN CAPTAIN BACKED THEM PREEMPTIVELY. OFFER. AND IF YOU A PURPOSE AS- SO WHILE PARTNERSHIP RECORD RECORD THE CAN TO ACT AND HOW CARE AND BASE X. THAT AND C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ALL-&lt;/c&gt;</u> FOOTBALL COME. AND MEDICAID NATIONALLY- WE WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE IT DIED- THE PROPOSAL WITH AND CAL AIMS MIGHT BE A HARD LEFT- FOR SOME OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ARE NOT YET AND VQA ACCREDITED- THERE ALSO ANOTHER KEY. AREA TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THERE'S VARIOUS AREAS AND FACTORS WITHIN AND FIFTY WAY TODAY THAT ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE ETF STANDARDS IN CONTRACT LANGUAGE SUCH AS DELEGATION DELEGATION OVERSIGHT. COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT IN THE PROPOSED ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFITS AND POPULATION HELP THEM IN THE QUEUE- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE NCQA STANDARDS CHANGE ANNUALLY- AND ACCREDITATION PROPERTIES HOW DISTINCTIVE LOOK BACK PERIOD- IN ORDER FOR PLANS TO MEET. THOSE BENCHMARKS SO THAT WOULD CREATE AN ADDITIONAL PRIME ONE STRUCTURE FOR BOTH PCS AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO- ORCHESTRATE ACTIVITIES. AND- REGULATIONS AROUND. LASTLY I WOULD THE AFTER COUNTY PROPOSED ITSELF- IF YOU MAYOR NOT AND MAY NOT BE AWARE BUT THE- REQUIREMENT HAVE AID SPECIAL NEEDS PROGRAM. AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOLLOWED BY THE NCQA REQUIREMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX LEAVE A ONE YEAR WINDOW. AND FOR NCQA THERE ARE CERTAIN- ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR PLANS THAT HAVE A DUAL SPECIAL NEEDS PROGRAM OR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE FIND ACTUALLY HAVE A TWO YEAR LOOK BACK PERIOD SO. THAT MIGHT NOT AFFORD PLANS I'M NOT TRYING TO BE SUCCESSFUL- TO MEET. THE REQUIREMENT IF ONLY GIVEN A YEAR. I'M PRETTY THREE THEY'RE SETTLED THEY'RE JUST- THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY IN PART IMPACT COST- PLAN OPERATIONS AND PROVIDER NETWORKS. BUT ULTIMATELY NEED TO SUPPORT THE PLAN- AND THEY'RE SICK FACT ARE WITHIN THE CALLIN PROPOSAL WE HAVE WE REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT REALLY PARTNER WITH- PLANT THAT ARE INSECURE CREDITED AND PLANS THAT ARE NOT- YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE KEY. DRIVERS LASTLY JUST TO HIGHLIGHT OUT AS A POTENTIAL OPTION IF- IN FORBEARANCE IS NOT ON THE TABLE THAT PERHAPS THE LANGUAGE WITHIN CALTRAIN BE AT REVISED TO INSTEAD OF FULL ACCREDITATION. THAT THE DEPARTMENT LOOK TO THOSE REMAINING PLANS TO SERVE AB HAVE FOR SURVEY OR IN TRUMP SURVEY EXCUSE ME ACCREDITATION. THE INTERNET SURVEY ACCREDITATION REALLY THIRDS OF READINESS BENCHMARK FOR FORMAL FULL ACCREDITATION AND COULD. REALLY AFTER SCAFFOLDING TO HELP THEM PLANNED- BUILD IN THE IF NECESSARY AT LONG TERM- INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT. I THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR AND WALK ANYTHING AFTER. THANK YOU VERY- WILL MOVE ON TO J. D. WITH THIS YET THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD END UP ARAMBULA AND GDS HERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES ON REQUIRING MANY COMMENTERS CAMPAIGNS TO BE NCQA ACCREDITED AND ALSO DH CS ABILITY TO DEAN PLANS COMPLIANCE TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- MISS COOPER MENTIONED THIS BUT JUST REMIND US ALL THAT SEVENTEEN OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE ALREADY. AND CQS ACCREDITED MOST OF WHICH ARE COMMERCIAL PLANS AND MOST OF WHICH HAVE STILL YET TO FULLY DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF MANAGED CARE AND ENSURING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- SA BELIEVES NCQA IS A GOOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD AND STANDARD BUT IT IS A NATIONAL STANDARD THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR EXISTING ROBUST. AND- THAT HAVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. IN THIS LEAGUE IS BASED IN. TWO COLORS LIKE THE KNOX KEEN ACT TO HOLD MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE IN MEETING THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- A SECOND LEAD THIS PROPOSAL LEAVES DISCRETION TO DH CS TO DECIDE WHETHER. TO DECIDE WHAT THEY CAN MONITOR- BASED ON NCQA STANDARDS THAT THE AGENCY HAS PROCESS WILL BECOME A BLACK BOX WHERE THE PUBLIC AND RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS WILL NOT KNOW WHAT NCQA STANDARDS THE AGENCY AS WELL OR WILL NOT MONITOR AND AT WHAT MONITORING AND DECISION MAKING PROCESS WILL BE H. C. AS USE FOR DEEMING NCQA STANDARDS TO MEET STATE PURPOSES. ARE WE STRONGLY SUGGEST NCQA ACCREDITS ACCREDITATION SHOULD BE PUBLICLY POSTED ON THE H. C. S. WE NEED PUBLIC DISCLOSURE SINCE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS FULLY WORKS WHAT IF PLANS DON'T MEET ALL STANDARDS IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE WILL BE A REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTION IF ANY. ARE WE STRONGLY SUGGEST DH CS SPECIFY WHICH STAKEHOLDERS A PLAN TO ENGAGE PER THE COW AND TBL SO WE CAN DETERMINE THAT THESE ARE APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT STAKEHOLDERS IT SHOULD NOT JUST BE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT THE H. THE ASKING FOR A WAIT THERE SHOULD BE PATIENT CONSUMER ADVOCATES AS EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVES OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND OTHERS THAT HAVE WORKED TO HOLD MANAGED CARE PLANS AND FRANKLY DH CS ACCOUNTABLE. LASTLY EXISTING LAW HAS REQUIREMENTS ON DH CS TO HAVE PROPER PROCESS FOR OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OVER TO THEIR DECISIONS WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ADDITIONAL TV ALL TO FURTHER ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ENGAGEMENT- IN ADDRESSING THIS PROPOSAL AND WITH ALL OF THAT SAID I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MY APOLOGIES- THAT I INADVERTENTLY LEFT OFF KERRY SANDERS- WITH. THE- THE SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE K. DEPEND I THINK HELP HEALTH THAT I HOPE SHE'S OUT THERE. WAS AN ERROR ON MY PART AND- I JUST JUMPED RIGHT OVER IT SOUTH. TWICE I'M HERE GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SO- GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS KERRY SANDERS AND THE SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK- DEPENDS THE STATEWIDE HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND ACHIEVING. PUBLICLY FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY- COMMITTEE CHAIRED JOINTLY HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AND THE STAFF AT DH CS- THEIR HARD WORK IN ADVANCING- THIS AMBITIOUS AT A PROPOSAL- WE WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE- NCQA ACCREDITATION WORKGROUP- AND HAVE COMMITTED SEVERAL COMMENT LETTERS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE THAT OUR PROPOSALS- BEFORE YOU- WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO INCREASE STANDARDIZATION AND REDUCE VARIATION ACROSS MANAGED CARE PLANS. IT'S KIND OF NOT OPPOSE REQUIRING ALL MEN AND MANAGED CARE PLAN TO GET ACCREDITATION FROM THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF JUST ELEVEN STATES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE AN TO COOK YOU A ACCREDITATION OF THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS WE RECOGNIZE THAT SEVENTEEN OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY SIX PLANS ARE ALREADY AND GQ ACCREDITED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS AND THIS REQUIREMENT COULD HELP ACCELERATE ADOPTION BY ALL PLAN- WELL AND SECURE CREDIT ASIAN IS IMPORTANT STRATEGY MANDATORY KNOCKS KEEN LICENSURE SHOULD BE A HIGHER PRIORITY. WE BELIEVE THAT MANDATORY- NOT IN LICENSURE WOULD BE A GREATER STEP TOWARD STANDARDIZATION FOR THAT ALL PLANTED HERE TO THE STATE AND STATE LAW AND ALL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE ACCESS. TO THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WE OPPOSE GAMING. CALIFORNIA LAW IS THAN FEDERAL. AND NOT NUMEROUS. INCLUDE FOR LANGUAGE JACK NOW ADDICT STAND AND MAY OTHER. WASHINGTON OTHER STATES REQUIRE AND TWO C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> ACCREDITATION WITHOUT ALLOWING DEEMING OTHER STATES ALLOW DEEMING IN ONLY VERY NARROW AND LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. IF ANY IS ALLOWED IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY VETTED TO BE IN INSTANCES WHERE THE REVIEWS AND HIGHLY DUPLICATIVE BOTH IN THE STANDARDS BEING TESTED THE SPECIFICS OF THE STANDARDS AND THE PROCESSES USED. DENOUNCES PROVIDED TO THE WORKGROUP INDICATED MANY METRICS THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY POTENTIALLY DIMPLE HAD DIFFERENT STANDARDS. LET'S LOOK AT THE FIFTY OR OTHERWISE DID NOT HOLD THE PLAN SIMILARLY ACCOUNTABLE. WE WOULD ONE. ANY GAME STANDARDS TO BE REVIEWED AND A PUBLIC PROCESS AND BE ROUTED WE VISITED ON A REGULAR BASIS. GIVEN THE NCQA STANDARDS OFTEN AND EVOLVE AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN CALIFORNIA AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IN PART BECAUSE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE OUR SCALE IN OUR STRUCTURE CALIFORNIA HAS REGULATIONS THAT ARE STRONGER THAN FEDERAL LAW INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO AS I MENTIONED LANGUAGE ACCESS NETWORK ADEQUACY AND OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. STANDARDS RELATIONSHIP SHOULD TAKE TO LEVEL UP TO EXPECTATIONS NOT WATER THEM DOWN. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND DELEGATION BOTH IN TERMS OF WEATHER AND PICTURESQUE PROVIDE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF DELEGATED ENTITIES. AND WHETHER AND THE DEMON UP ANOTHER LAYER OF DELEGATION IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT. DHS THE PROVIDE CALLING PROPOSAL STATES THAT ACCREDITATION ELEMENTS THAT ARE SELECTED FOR POTENTIAL DEEMING WILL BE VETTED WITH STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE ANY FINAL DECISIONS ARE MADE. BUT CURRENT MANY MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACT ALREADY ALLOW FOR DEEMING UNCERTAIN SITUATIONS SUCH AS PROVIDER ORGANIZATION CREDENTIALING HEALTH PLAN ACCREDITATION AND CREDENTIALING OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WITHOUT CONSUMER STAKEHOLDER INPUT. WE REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE STRIKE THE DHS'S PROPOSED LANGUAGE ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT INDIAN PLANS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE INTENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSULT WITH AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS- AS THEY SAY TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE- BUT WE YOU KNOW FILL THAT STRONGER PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED AND WE HAVE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN OUR STANDARDS IN PLACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PLANS ARE FOLLOWING THEM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO ANSWERING ANY ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO FROM COMMITTEE A QUESTIONS. TO DR EMIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'M GOING TO HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IF I COULD WITH WHERE SEE PAN AND S. YEAH YOU WERE ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND- I DO BELIEVE THAT A GOAL OF CALLIE MISS STANDARDIZATION AND SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHY. AREN'T WE STANDARDIZE AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY REQUIRING KNOCKS KEEN LICENSORS INSTEAD OF THE NCQA ACCREDITATION. SO YEAH HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK BOTH KNOCKS KEEN REQUIREMENTS NCQA SERVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS JUST TO BE CLEAR SO ON THE DMH SEASIDE FOR A REGULATORY POINT OF VIEW THAT THERE IS VERY IMPORTANT I REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE THERE- IN IN MEDIC HOW. ABOUT WE HAVE CO'S PLANS WHO ARE NOT KNOCKS KEEN LICENSE WE DO HOLD THEM- VIA THEIR CONTRACT TO ALL OF THE NIGHT KNOCKING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HOLD OUR KNOCKS KEEN. UP PLANS TO USE OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE EMBEDDED INTO THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS- AND THAT'S CURRENTLY HOW WE IN BED SOME OF THOSE KNOCKS KEEN REQUIREMENTS INTO. THE CO'S PLANS CONTRACT WEBER NOTATING AS YOU MENTIONED- THAT DOESN'T GIVE DO YOU MAY SEE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THOSE PLANS JUST. TO BE CLEAR ON THE NCQA SIDE IT'S REALLY AROUND STANDARDIZING IN THE AREAS THAT I'VE- AND HIGHLIGHTED SPECIFICALLY AROUND A QUALITY UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHERCOMPONENTS THERE AND CARE COORDINATION AND THAT'S JUST A DIFFERENT FUNCTION IN REGARDS TO THE ROLE. THAT YOU MAY SEE PLAYS OF THE REGULATORY BODY- IT'S ALSO WHY THE DEPARTMENT STILL FEELS WE NEED TO BE. IN THE ROLE OF OVERSIGHT AT THE DMH C. R. STARTED THE DH CS A PLAN THE MEDICARE PLANS REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LARGE DIFFERENCE IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE DO FOR OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT OF OUR- OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND JUST TO CLARIFY BASED ON THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS BY NO MEANS WOULD WE NOT BE ENFORCING THROUGH THE ACS IS OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING SPOTS ABILITIES ALL STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN ANYWHERE WHERE THE STATE LAW GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND FEDERAL LAW OR AND SEE IF YOU A REQUIREMENTS WE WOULD STILL BE HOLDING THE MASK CARE PLANS TO THOSE REQUIREMENTS. I'M THROUGH OUR OWN MONITORING- OF SERVICES AT THE DEPARTMENT SO JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT BASED ON SOME OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS. JUST MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR AS WELL. THANK YOU THAT CLARIFICATION AND FOR THAT I AM I'D LIKE TO DIG INTO FURTHER I COULD ON. AS AS THE- KNOWS I'VE AUTHORED BILLS THAT WOULD. ESTABLISH A QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP US TO IMPROVE THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN. QUALITY AND FOR US TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. CONSIDERING THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT. WE ARE PUTTING INTO CALTRAIN HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL DRIVE AND HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING QUALITY OF ONE ASPECT IS THE PROPOSAL TO- HAVE. NCQA ACCREDITATION WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR. A SET OF STANDARD RULES ACROSS ALL PLANS IN REGARDS TO THE QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE- BUT THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE VARIOUS PIECES I WE ALSO HAVE BEEN OF. INCREASING OUR REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO BENCHMARKING HOW WE EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS ALONG QUALITY OF IT WILL BE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN REALLY ENGAGE WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO YOU- IMPROVEMENTS ON THE QUALITY SPACE. I THINK WE ARE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AROUND HOW WE WORK WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT UP WHICH INCLUDES FOCUSING ON THINGS LIKE DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION AND NOT JUST THE METRICS. I THINK IT'S WHY YOU SEEN SOME OF THE REASON AND INVESTMENTS AROUND THINGS LIKE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION UP OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US MOVE THAT QUALITY NEED L. THERE'S ALSO A PIECES AROUND IMPROVING CONTACT- AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT LATER IN THIS. PRESENTATION ASSEMBLY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT PLANTS ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO OUTRAGE AND ENGAGE WITH BENEFICIARIES SO THEY HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION POSSIBLE TO DO THAT SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO APPROACH IMPROVING QUALITY. WITH OUR PLANS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS ONE OF WHICH IS THE NCQA. A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACCREDITATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- THANK YOU- AND I DID MINE MORE OF A COMMENT AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND THAT IT THAT'S WHAT MY COMING GOES AROUND- THE- THAT YOU ARE HOLDING PLANS YOU'LL BE HOLDING PLANS TO THE KNOX KEEN STANDARDS AND ENFORCE AND FORCING ON THAT AND I THINK THAT'S- I APPRECIATE THAT THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- AND- THAT AND I L. SAY THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. THE COST TO FOR A CO TO UNDERGO THAT THE PROCESS TO BECOME A KNOCKS KEEN PLAN IS AT LEAST IN ONE CASE THAT I KNOW OF NORTH OF A MILLION DOLLARS AND SO. THAT MEANS THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO PROPERLY TO PATIENT CARE OR OR WHATEVER- AND IF YOU'RE HOLDING THEM TO THE SAME STANDARDS THEN. IF THAT WERE TO EVER CHANGE OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING HELD THE SAME STANDARDS WHETHER THEY ARE NOT KEEN PLAN OR NOT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT FACT THAT CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK WITH THAT- WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE PANEL TO ON THE PROPOSED AUTHORITY FOR DH CS TO ESTABLISH MEDICAL. MANAGED CARE PLANS ON A REGIONAL BASIS. WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS LINDY HERRINGTON BEN JOHNSON. MAY ALTMAN AND DOCTOR LARRY GET HEALTHY. AND LET'S BEGIN WITH CASEY COOPER PLEASE.

TO OPERATE MORE THE THEN AND IT IT WOULD COME THIS BY. BUT CHEN NOT REMEMBER PLANS FOR THE FOLKS OF THIS THEY PAY FOR IF THOSE ARE IF THOSE ARE COST- OUR OPPONENTS GET REIMBURSED FOR THE- COST OF THE PLANS WITHIN THEIR OWN RE WHAT VERY ADJUSTMENTS- AS MISS CAN- AND SO HERE THE HIGHER. WERE RECEIVE LESS THAN REIMBURSE WHILE THE LOWER PLANS WOULD RECEIVE A FINAL PLANNER- DUE TO LEVEL- AS PREVIOUSLY- AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGH THE DALLAS THE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE OF THIS FOR IS THAT IT MY WOULD PRODUCE DIFFERENT WINNERS AND LOSERS. THEN UNDER TODAY'S- SIX- PERCH THOSE. WHO NOT. THE SOUND PUBLIC POLICY PROVIDED IMPROVED EFFICIENCY WITHOUT COMPARING THE BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCE SUCH AS BY REDUCING ACCESS OR QUALITY OF CARE. TODAY WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE STTE'S-HIGHER COST MEDICAL PLANS ARE OFTEN DO PERFORM SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN SOME OF THE LOWER COST PLANS ON A RANGE OF ACCESSING QUALITY MEASURES. AND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE TRANSITION TO REGIONAL RATE SETTING WHAT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY BUT AT THE COST OF. ACCESSING QUALITY AND SO WE'RE PLEASED TO HEAR- COMMENTS FROM MS HARRINGTON THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING. WAYS TO MORE CLOSELY TIED MANAGED CARE PLAN FUNDING. TO THE PERFORMANCE ON ON ACCESS AND QUALITY STANDARDS AND WOOD WELCOME YEAH WELL WELCOME- SORT OF ANY AN OUTLINE OF WHAT THAT PROPOSAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MY OLD MAN- CEO OF THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO. GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS MORNING. MY MOM GOING TO PRESENT THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THE HOPE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATION- OF LAW LOCAL HEALTH PLANS. LIKE OURS I'M SO THE KEY QUESTION WE HAVE IS ABOUT REGIONAL RIGHT STATING IS WE DON'T QUESTION THE VALUE OF DOING IT BUT RATHER THE QUESTION IS WILL IT BE DONE PROPERLY AND FAIRLY. THERE IS TREMENDOUS VARIATION ACROSS THE LOCAL HEALTH CARE MARKETS EVEN IF- PLANS HAVE STANDARDIZED BENEFITS SO IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE- IN NOT HOSPITAL MARKETS ARE BEARISH OUR REGION. ON UCSF CONTRACTS WITH SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH PLAN THE SAME BASIS IS THAT CONTRACTS WITH ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN SCOTT THAT'S CONTRACTED WITH WITH THE HEALTH PLAN YES YOU SEE STAFF DEMANDS A PERCENTAGE OF CHARGES. I'M FROM THE HELP PLAN A SAN MATTEO AND OUR MEMBERS JUST LIVE A FEW MILES OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO SO ONE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IS HOW WILL DH D. H. U. S. ACCOUNT FOR THE REAL ON HEALTH CARE COST DIFFERENCES. AMONG COUNTIES THAT MAY BE GROUPED INTO THE SAME REGION WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DETAIL ON THAT YET- AS- DEPUTY DIRECTOR HARRINGTON MENTIONED RESEARCH JASMINE IS- IS A PRIMARY METHOD USED FOR IS. ASSESSING THE RISK OF SERVING DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT IS FOR COMPENSATING A PLAN THAT HAS MEMBERS WITH MORE HEALTH ISSUES AND THEREBY- WITH HIGHER COSTS. AND SO WE UNDERSTAND RISK IT JUST MEANS LIKELY TO BE USED FOR STUDY RATES AMONG PLANS IN OUR REGION- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT RISK ADJUSTMENT IS A PROBLEMATIC METHODOLOGY. IT IS A CERTAIN ZERO SUM GAME SO THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS AS HAS BEEN NOTED. ON ITS USE NOW IN THE G. PLAN COUNTIES AND THE RISKS ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED ACCORDING TO ANALYSES THAT WE'VE DONE ON USING IT. ACTUARIES HARD BY LH. PC EVEN THE MAN ALL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR OF THE- D. A. KERR APPROACH EXPLAIN ABOUT PER OF THE REST. AND THE PROPOSED FUTURE APPROACH IS- BELONGINGS. LIKE US HIGHER PERCENTAGE- HEALTH PLAN TO STORE BUT- THE HIGHEST RISK MEMBERS IF THE CURRENT RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY IS CONSISTENTLY AND REPRESENTED. THE COSTS OF THESE HIGH RISK MEMBERS. OF STUDIES PRODUCED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES AND CONCLUDED THAT NO RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY CAN FULLY EXPLAIN RISK DIFFERENCES IN THE PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT. RISK VARIATION AMONG PLANTS. EXPECTED RESULT AND WOULD BE% UNDER FUNDING PLANS. WHICH SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER NEEDS. I ANY ON ON THE LINE PROBLEMS WITH THIS JUST ME MATTHEY WHICH IS METHODOLOGY BUT ONLY COME. IN WHICH RIGHT. I'M FINE WE DON'T HAVE DAY ON THE AND ON CEILING PLANS PLANTS BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN PART OF ANY OF THE STATE RESIDUALS AND EFFORTS TODAY SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. WITH THE CODES PLANTS. NOW TO STAND BY- SAYING THAT THAT THAT STATE YOU REALLY DECIDE ON ITS POLICY GOALS UP FRONT- SO FOR EXAMPLE AND- THEN JOHNSON POINTED OUT THE CLOSE MODEL PLANS IT CONSISTENTLY SCORED AMONG THE HIGHEST. QUALITY SCORES- HOW WILL QUALITY BE INCORPORATE THE RIGHTS PROCESS AGAIN WHEN COURAGE ONTO YOUR THAT THE- DOES PLAN. TO REALLY AND CALL IN THE RIGHT SETTING. HOW MUCH DEEPLY THAN IT HAS TODAY- WILL PROGRESS QUALITY INNOVATION LOST PLANS ARE DRIVEN TO FORWARD IT YOU COST EFFICIENCIES. AND AND I THINK ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IS RISK ADJUSTMENT WILL NOT ACCOUNT FOR HEALTH DISPARITY. IF THE REGIONAL RATE SETTING PROCESS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY RECOGNIZED THAT YOU REDUCE FIRST DISPARITIES ADEQUATE FUNDING PERHAPS EVEN MORE FUNDING NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED TO COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDERS WERE DISPARITIES ARE HIGHER. I'M TO THE EXTENT REGENERATE SAID HE DOES NOT PRIORITIZE QUALITY ACCESS INNOVATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITIES BEING SIR THERE MAY BE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON LOCAL HEALTH PLANTS. SO WE'VE TO RECOMMENDATIONS ON FIRST- AND WE YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE BUT HEALTH PLANS NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE HELPING DESIGN THE STRUCTURE FOR REGIONAL RATE SETTING. AND SECONDLY IT WAS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL THIS WILL BE A CRITICAL INITIATIVE AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE INVOLVED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S FAIR AND HELPS ACHIEVE THE OVERALL STATE POLICY GOALS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- THANK YOU. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE WILL HEAR DOCTOR. DATE COULD TOLD T. WHO IS. CENTER PALO ALTO. FOUNDATION IN SANTA CRUZ C. THANK GOODNESS AND THANK YOU MY- AND I KEPT TO I DRESSED LITTLE FUN TODAY I AM WE ARE WE HAVE A MASS VACCINATION CLINIC AND I'VE COME IN FROM OUTSIDE- DOING THAT WORK I HAVE A COUPLE REFLECTIONS AT THE END OF MY- TIME I LIKE TO SHARE. BUT FIRST I LET THIS WORK LET ME JUST SAY THIS WORK IS SO IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THAT YOU'RE MAKING BECAUSE THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF MEDICAID IN CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN LICENSE IN IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST TRANSFORMATIONAL. SET OF CHANGES I'VE SEEN IN SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S PHYSICIANS CARING FOR OUR OUR MEDIC CAL MEMBERS. IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IN IN IN BUILD TRUST AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE OR BUILD TRUST- FOR THE- PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA IS MAKE THE WORK TRANSPARENT MAKE THE FEE SCHEDULE TRANSPARENT. AS BEST AS POSSIBLE DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL AS WE MOVE- SO MANY OF THESE DUAL BENEFICIARIES INTO THE INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM A LINE ARE. HOW WE VIEW AND RISK ADJUST AND BUILD GEOGRAPHIES ALIGNED WITH WHAT MEDICARE IS DOING AND KEEP IN MIND THE QUADRUPLE AIM WHICH WOULD BE- IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE IMPROVE PROVIDER EXPERIENCE. IMPROVE CLINICAL QUALITY AND LOWER THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AND I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO ALL FOUR OF THOSE. SO LET ME JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON WHAT I MEAN BY ALLYING WITH MEDICARE. FIRST OF ALL WHAT OTHER GEOGRAPHIES HOW WE DIVIDE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WELL WE USE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WILL WE USE THAT THE NINETEEN COVERED CALIFORNIA REGIONS- I WOULD NOT I WOULD ADOPT WHAT. WHAT CMS ADOPTED A WHICH ARE VERY CAREFULLY THROUGH A PROCESS A DERIVED BY THE OFFICE OF. MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET IT HAS TO VIED CAL INTO A PROXY TWENTY TO CHARTER. BASED ON- THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE WE'RE THE ONLY STATE WHERE THE PART A FACILITY ARE. ICING STRUCTURE AND THE PART B. PHYSICIAN AND OUTPATIENT- GEOGRAPHIES ARE ALIGNED I RECOMMEND THAT WE ADOPT DOES GEOGRAPHY FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO GEOGRAPHY CONSISTS OF YOLO EL DORADO CLASSROOMS SACRAMENTO. AND SONOMA CONSIST OF ITS OWN GEOGRAPHY AND THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE PROGRAM SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN MATTEO AND MY TALKED ABOUT WHAT THAT MARKET AND HOW SAN MATTEO RELIES ON SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITALS THAT MARKET IS ONE GEOGRAPHY. OF THE SECOND THE POINT IS HOW DO WE SET RATES BASED ON A COST INPUTS. SAMSCLUB AREA HAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE HEALTHCARE MARKET IN THE COUNTRY- THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ANNUALLY MEASURES THE COST TO DELIVER CARE IN EACH OF ITS FOUR HUNDRED GEOGRAPHIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THE BAY AREA IS THE HIGHEST ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT THE AVERAGE COST TO DELIVER A HOSPITAL SERVICE. FOR AMERICA'S MEDICARE POPULATION WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD SHOULD FOLLOW AND TRACKED AND ADOPT REGIONAL RATES. BASED ON WHAT IT COSTS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS THE SINGLE BEST SOURCE OF THAT DATA IS THE ANNUALLY PRODUCED MEDICARE HOSPITAL WAGE INDEX AND I RECOMMEND THAT WE USE THAT IN THE RIGHT SETTING. RISK ADJUSTMENT IS AS MYERS SAID ANOMALY IMPORTANT I'M STRUCK BY I'M A I'M A COMMISSIONER ON THE CENTER CALL FOR AN ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH WE HAVE. SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY AND MERCED COUNTY I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE HIGHEST OXIDATION RATES IN THOSE THREE COUNTIES FOR CODE ORANGE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. BUT THE CAT WHICH HAS THE LEAST COVERT PENETRATION AND HAS HAD THE GREATEST SUCCESS BECAUSE OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS AS COMPARED TO MERCED COUNTY WHICH HAS THE LOWEST VACCINATION RATE AND HAS THE GREATEST DISEASE BURDEN. AND HOW DO WE RISK ADJUST WELL RISK ADJUSTMENT IS WHAT IT IS ALREADY USED FOR ALL OF THE 40% OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. THERE IS UP THE PHYSICIANS ARE OR WELL ADAPTED TO THE RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY USED IN AN MBA PROGRAM IT IS THE SAME RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY WE USE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA WHERE WE A RISK ADJUSTER CROSSED THE COMMERCIAL PLANS. THE CARE FOR CERTAIN THE HETEROGENEOUS POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IN FACT OVER BILLION DOLLARS MOVES FROM OF A PLAN THAT CARES FOR LESS SICK CALIFORNIANS TO ANOTHER PLAN WHICH CARES FOR THE SICK POPULATION. THE RISK ADJUSTMENT TOOL IS BUILT FROM THE PATIENT WE ACTUALLY MEASURE RISK IS DEFINED BY THE DIAGNOSIS CODES OF THE PATIENTS IT'S ENTIRELY APPLICABLES TO THE MEDICARE POPULATION. AND IT AND IN FACT WE COULD ENHANCE IT AND BUILD SOME OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT MEYER A MANSION MEDICARE PROGRAM IS STARTING TO DO THAT. AND THE ADVANTAGE OF USING PATIENT DERIVED PATIENT CENTERED RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGIES IS IT IT ENCOURAGES PATIENTS TO HAVE LONGITUDINAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. WHO WILL DO AN ANNUAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND APPROPRIATELY CODE AND IDENTIFY THOSE A CLINICAL CONDITIONS. THAT PUT THE PATIENT AT RISK. LASTLY CLINICAL QUAL. SHOULD BE AND- AN INCENTIVE FOR ALL PLANS AND PROVIDERS BUT IT SHOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ALL DULY INSURED BENEFICIARIES AND SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE VERY SUCCESSFUL MEDICARE ADVANTAGE STARS PROGRAM. MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HIGHER QUALITY THAN TRADITIONAL MEDICARE PATIENTS AND I THINK WE CAN USE THE LEARNINGS FROM MANAGED CARE TO ENCOURAGE IT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE. FOR OUR A MEDIC CAL PATIENTS LASTLY MY REFLECTION ON I JUST WANTED TO SHARE I THOUGHT I HAD VACCINATING PATIENTS TODAY AND HOW THE PATIENT WAS OVER A HUNDRED. AND I HAD A NINETEEN YEAR OLD THAT I VACCINATED. HELLO I'M COLFAX IN NATION IS REALLY CHOICE FOR ALL OF US I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED- IN MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER MORE JOY FROM PATIENTS AND NURSES AND DOCTORS. AND THEN THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU WANTED TO REFLECT ON WHY IT BESIDES THE OBVIOUS- A RELIEF ACTIVITY FROM GETTING THE VACCINE. THE PATIENTS RECEIVE NO CHARGE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PREVENTIVE SERVICE I'VE OFFERED TO PATIENTS IN MY CAREER THE PATIENTS GET THE CARE FREE OF CHARGE. THE PATIENTS WILL NOT AND WILL NOT RECEIVE A BILL FOR THE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OR FOR THE VACCINATION ITSELF. THAT IS LIBERATING FOR PATIENTS. AND FOR PROVIDERS AND THIS IS SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND- SOME OF THE PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS THEY WERE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE SOMEWHERE KAISER MEMBERS SOME HAVE NO INSURANCE SOMEWHERE UNDOCUMENTED. AND EVERY PATIENT I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WHICH OF THOSE HATERS WHETHER THE STATE PAYS FOR THEIR CARE WHETHER THEIR EMPLOYER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THEIR CARE. LET'S TRY TO YEAH I IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THE PHYSICIANS DON'T HAVE TO ASK AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE CARE WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BASED ON WHO PAYS FOR THE PATIENT'S CARE SO. I WOULD THAT'S MY FINE ART AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR AND- HAVING BEEN OUT THERE VACCINATING MYSELF I WOULD JUST ECHO YOUR COMMENTS AND SAY A MAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND CONTINUING TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES HELPING TO TAKE CARE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH THAT I WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. C. NON I WILL ASK MY QUESTION THEN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FIGHT COULD I. THOUGHT BEN JOHNSON HIGHLIGHTED WELL WHEN HE SAID WE NEED TO HAVE AN OUTLINE FOR WHAT OUR PLAN IS. WE HEARD FROM MY OLD MAN ABOUT HOW THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PUT ITS POLICY GOALS OUT FRONT. AND WILL JUST WEAR ON MY SLEEVE HOW MUCH I'VE TRIED TO HAVE US AS A LEGISLATURE. PRIORITIZE AND INCENTIVIZE PREVENTATIVE CARE AND DRIVE TOWARDS QUALITY. THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT IF I COULD IF WE SET ASIDE THE VARIATIONS OF. COST OF LIVING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE. GENERALLY OUR OUR MANAGED CARE RATES SET WITH AN EYE TOWARDS INCENTIVIZING PREVENTIVE CARE AND DRIVING FOR QUALITY. THREE THREE THIRTEEN AND EVEN THE HOCKLEY. FROM THE PLANT ITSELF FOR THE SB. A GREAT. FROM ACTOR CONFLICT PLANT. PROVIDING AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE- INCLUDED SAMPLES BRACKET THANK. I'VE IS HE MAY AND LOCAL RENT I'M I'M PROUD QUALITY- AND IT REALLY WE ARE. AT HOW IN MORE- I. IN ANY CORPORATE- AND IN BED NO QUALITY. ACT. IN ARE RIGHT THANK YOU- MORE BROADLY YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK A CLEAN PARTNERS AT THE- IN THAT IT AND I GOT- BUT A BIT YOU GET CAUGHT. EXACTLY EXACTLY COSTS AND- THAT- AT THE BY BY THE. B. FOR THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS HEARD HERE TODAY WITHOUT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL TO AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANIC THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REVIEW AND THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE- OKAY ARE WITNESSES FOR THIS PANEL- AND ESTANCIA DOTS IN THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR POLICY OR JC COOPER- SOMEONE FROM THE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES I BELIEVE- NED RESTING COUGH OF FISCAL POLICY ANALYST FOR THE- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. JACK DALY THE DIRECTOR POLICY AND TRAINING AND COORDINATOR. THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE AT THE AT LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. IT'S A LOT TO PUT ON A BUSINESS CARD- MY ALTMAN- CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO. EVE GELB- A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND MEMBER AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SCAN HEALTH PLAN SO WE'LL. GO AHEAD AND START WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M GONNA TURN IT TO AND DOT WHO WILL BECAUSE ON BEHALF OF THE- TODAY THANK YOU. THE TOPIC HERE IS THE SON SAID OF CASH MEDIC. AND REQUIRED FOR A LINE. DUAL ELIGIBLES NEEDS PLANS. OR D. SNIPS. GOOD MORNING- THIS IS ANASTASIA DOBSON THE CALIBER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE. YES HM WE HAVE A- VERY PLAY TO BE WORKING ON THIS ASPECT OF THE CAN ISSUE DO- THE TRANSITION OF POOR NEED CARE INITIATIVE AND CONNECT. WE HAVE A NUMBER LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE EIGHT INITIATIVES THAT ARE WOVEN THROUGH THE MOSEL WE KNOW THAT YOUR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES BENEFIT BENEFIT FROM INTEGRATED ACCORDING CARE IS WHY WE'RE TO EXTEND. UP MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL A LOT ROAD. TO ALL IN THE STATE CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW IN CC ICRA CARE INITIATIVE THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE- CALVET CONNECT WITH TO EXPAND MODEL WHY TO HAVE A LINE THE MOMENT- THE RISK ASSESSMENT. HAS VERY HELPFUL. LESSONS THAT WE ARE GOING TO. IN CAL FOR THE POPULATION HEALTH MAY STRATEGY FOR CALLING THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS TO BUY LISTA FOR CALVIN CONNECT. SIXTY NINE. IN C. C. I. WE REALLY SAW THE VALUE OF. MEDICARE MANAGED PLAN ENGAGEMENT WITH PROVIDE. COUNTIES AND- PARTNERS ON I HSS THE NUMBER OF OTHER PROOF TO COORDINATE THAT FOR OF. AND REDUCE BEEN YEAR IT FAMILY CARE GIVER COMPETE. IN CAL WE'RE GOING TO BE COURT THOSE PART. YOUR THROUGHOUT THE CARE MAY. AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES BENEFIT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE INCUMBENT CONNECT WERE VERY OF IS THE DEMENTIA CAL CAN PROJECT. WHICH PROVIDES CONSUL TO HELP BRING AND FOR MAN. AND FAMILY CARE GIVER IN PARTNERSHIP THE ALSO IS THE- EACH YEAR WILL BE IN COURT THE SIX MY INTO. FOR BOTH THE ALLOWED AND MEDICARE ONLY BEEN. ALSO IN A CCA THE COR CARE WITH THAT PLANS CAN REALLY A KEY ROLE. IN SUPPORTING BENEFITS TO. FROM IN CARE IN THE CAN. OF COMEDY PLANS NOW YOU LIKE. OF CARE PLAN. AND FINANCIAL A LINE. OF MANY HOW MEDICARE. INCOME ANY CONNECT TO INVEST INC TRANSITION AND HELP MEMBERS. FROM INSTITUTE CARE IN THE CAN AND SUCCESSFULLY STATE. THE COMMUNITY. THESE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED WERE REALLY INTO IN HELP DIVERT TO DEVELOP ENHANCED MANAGE. AND IN A- THE POPPY. IN NEED GREATER CARE ME. AND THE NUMBER OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES INCLUDING COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS AND HOME MODIFICATIONS. OF CCI COMEDY CONNECT HAS A LONG HISTORY NOW- SO WE'RE DEFINITELY USING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. THE LESSONS ARE ALSO HELP TO SUPPORT THE STATE WIDE CARBON OF LONG TERM CARE INTO MANAGED CARE SO. JUST TO SHARE A COUPLE OF DATA POINTS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SCANNED FOUNDATION REPORT THAT ASSESSED THE EXPERIENCES OF A DUALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES IN COMEDY CONNECT. ON THAT 94% OF COMEDY CONNECTED FEATURES REPORTED THAT THEY WERE VERY OR AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SATISFIED WITH THEIR BENEFITS. AND THIS WAS HIGHEST AMONG THE COMITY CONNECT BENEFICIARIES COMPARED TO THOSE WHO OPTED OUT OR THOSE IN NINE C. C. A. COUNTY- THERE IS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT RE. IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE- ACCORDING TO THAT SCAN REPORT- AND IN 20001787% OF COMEDY CONNECTED BENEFICIARIES. RATED THEIR QUALITY OF CARE AS EITHER EXCELLENT OR GOOD WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM 84% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO WE'RE PROUD OF THAT AND- SO THE NEXT QUESTION RELATED POINT WAS ABOUT- FOR DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLANS OR D. SNAPS ON THE MEDICARE SIDE- JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT THE- VOLUNTARY OPT IN ENROLLMENT. BY DUAL ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES- SO THERE WILL THERE WILL NOT BE PASSIVE ENROLLMENT INTO DE SNAPS SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN FEE FOR SERVICE AND MOST MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS THEY THEY WILL NOT HAVE PASSIVE ENROLLMENT- HOWEVER WE ARE AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN WE TRANSITION. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN COUNT MANY CONNECT. INTO AN ALIGNED D. SNAP AND- MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN WE WILL HAVE THE- CROSSWALK IN ROMAN PROCESS AND WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS FULLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AT OF STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP SERIES THAT WE'VE STARTED SO WE'RE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSITION GO SMOOTHLY. I'M MY OTHER PIECE OF PIECE BUT FOR THAT IS NOT RENEW CONTRA FOR MANY AGAIN. DECENT LOCAL PLAN THAT SERVE D°ûI BUT DON'T OFTEN SAME DAY. SO THERE BE A TRAIN PROCESS- FOR THOSE MEMBER. INTO DECENT. WITH SUBSEA SO FROM NETWORK SO WE WILL HAVE A- SOME- JUST TRANSITION OF CERTAIN BENEFITS. INTO BETTER- MANAGED CARE STRUCTURE. AND THEN WE- ONE OF ANY MEDICAL ONLY BENEFICIARY SO WHO IS NOT YET ELIGE FOR MEDI. WHEN THEY GAIN BETTER L. THROUGH EIGHT OR VISIT. THEN. D. SNAP OF LYING TO BE THAT OFFERED BY THE MEDIC CAL PLAN THAT THEY'RE IN- WE- THAT PLAN WILL TRIMS THAT INTO THE A LINE DECENT. SO YEAH WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING IN GREAT DETAIL STEAK ABOUT ALL OF THESE PROCESS- IT OVER THE COMING- EIGHTEEN OR SO BEFORE THE TRANSITION OCCURS IN TWENTY THREE. BUT IN ALL CASES- DO WELL BIT AND ISSUES CONTINUE TO HAVE THE TO CHOOSE MEDICARE FEE SERVICE. OR MEDICARE GAME PLAN THAT- A FUNDAMENTAL. IN THERE WAS A QUESTION OF D. SNAP UP BY A BILL EVEN IF THEY HAVE LOW IN RAW IN CAN- THOSE PLANS OFTEN. COVER MULTIPLE. SO I THERE DECENT STOP IN THIRTY SIX OF CAL FIFTY EIGHT. AND NOTHING THAT MADE THE TO SAY TO. DISNEY WITH YOUR THEN A THOUSAND MEN AND COUNTY SO I IT IT IS VIABLE AND WE'RE GLAD TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. WITH PLANS IN AFRICA ABOUT THE BUT. IT IS A VIABLE. AND FOR SEVEN- THE DC ONLINE IN ROMAN POLICY WOULD BE SO WOULD THE SAME FOR THE MEDIGAP OR NOT DELEGATE CLAIM SO WHAT THATIS THAT IF THAT'S IN IN A DECENT FOR MEDICARE- IF THAT THE SNAP IS A DELEGATED PLAN. THEN THE- MEDIC HOUSE WHERE THERE'S OF- DELEGATED ON THE MEDICAL THAT WE MATCH SO- WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT- BENEFITS BENEFITS FROM THE CORNER CARE FROM HAVING THIS ORGAN. MANAGE THEIR MEDIC AND MEDICARE BENEFITS AND- YEAH WE'RE TALKING TO A LOT OF THE IN OUR STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP- FINALLY THERE'S A QUESTION OR IT CAN MANY CAN- BUT AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HIKING. WE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION NEXT FALL AND THEN RELEASE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NEXT JANUARY FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE SO- WITH. RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THAT- PIECES OF CALLIE AND THAT- WE NEED TO WORK ON THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE BUDGET PROCESS. FOR NEXT YEAR WE WILL DO THAT IN DUE TIME. SO I THINK THAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE QUESTIONS. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE WILL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT I GOTTA ASK THIS ONE BECAUSE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF TERMINOLOGY AND MY TIME AS CHAIR HERE. BUT WHAT IS A CROSSWALK ENROLLMENT PROCESS I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT ONE. OKAY SURE. SO WHAT WHAT WE WILL DO IS- IN IT'S SORT OF AN AUTOMATED WAY MAKE SURE THAT IF- SOMEONE IS ENROLLED IN KALMADI CONNECT FOR. A PARTICULAR HEALTH PLAN RIGHT NOW. THEN IN PREPARATION FOR JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE WILL DO- AND- WILL WORK WITH THE HEALTH PLANS AND CMS. ON AN AUTOMATED PROCESS SO THAT THE STATE. IN THAT SAME HEALTH PLAN BUT THEY WILL SPLIT. WITH FOR THEIR MEDICARE BENEFITS THEY WILL BE IN A DECENT AND FOR THEIR MEDICARE BENEFITS. WE WILL BE IN A MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN. BUT BOTH OF THE DECENT AND THE MEDICARE PLAN WILL BE OPERATED BY THE SAME PARENT ORGANIZATION. AND SO BY HAVING THAT SAME ORGANIZATION- ADMINISTER. THE BENEFITS FOR BOTH. OF PROGRAMS THEY CAN SHARE DATA INTERNALLY. THEY CAN HAVE OF THE SAME CARE COORDINATOR. THEY CAN- COORDINATE ACROSS PROVIDERS. BUT THAT CROSSWALK ENROLLMENT MAKES SURE THAT. BENEFICIARIES DON'T NEED TO. MAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE SELECTION THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO INTO- THE MEDIC MEDIC COW AND A DECENT PLAN THAT MATCHES THEIR CURRENT. CAL MANY CONNECT CLAN. OKAY GOOD WELL THANK YOU RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE FROM MY VOCABULARY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT- WITNESSES- MR RESNICK COUGH- FISCAL POLICY ANALYSTS ANALYSTS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- THIS IS- NAY REZNIKOV WITH L. A. O. BUT AS- WE DESCRIBE IN OUR- REPORT- KELLY PROPOSALS RELATED TO SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. ON THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF CARE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES- STDS IS A HIGHLY FRAGMENTED. AND THAT'S THE CASE BOTH FOR THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE- A PROGRAM SUCH AS- I HSS AND- AT PACE AND SO ON BUT ALSO FOR- FRAGMENTATION BETWEEN. MEDIC HAL AND MEDICARE SO. WE TO THINK THAT- THE DECENT PROPOSAL COULD POTENTIALLY IMPROVE COORDINATION BETWEEN MEDICARE AND MEDICARE FOR THE SENIOR POPULATION AND THAT THE DUAL ELIGIBLE POPULATION BUT THERE ARE POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS BETWEEN THE SCALABILITY OF THE D. STEP MODEL AND THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION. THAT DISTANCE WOULD OFFER AND THERE'S ALSO- SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF STANDARDISATION STATEWIDE THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. NOW THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T REALLY SPECIFY WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD BE REQUIRED OF THE STEPS AND BECAUSE THE STATE IS GOING TO BE SETTING UP A DECENT CONTRACT TERMS UNDER CAL AIM- THIS COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THIS COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. THINK ABOUT- WHAT SORT OF TERMS AND WHAT REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON ANTI STEPS ONE MORE ONE MORE COMMENT- WHICH IS- THAT. IT A AND- HOW VIABLE IT IS TO TAKE THE STEPS STATEWIDE INTO INTO EVERY COUNTY AND WHAT SORT OF A POLICY OR FISCAL INCENTIVES. WOULD BE NEEDED FOR- PLANS TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S FORTY STEP COVERAGE AND ALL IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE- SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. I THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT WILL UP WE MAY HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU- AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE REST OF THE PANEL SO. WE'LL MOVE ON TO JACK DALY THE DIRECTOR POLICY AND TRAINING AND COORDINATOR FOR THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE AT THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. AGREE THAT IS THE AMOUNT FOR. MY BUSINESS CARD IS BUSIER AND ACTUALLY LEFT OFF ONE OF MY TOTAL SO- THAT'S WE HAVE A BACKSIDE OF THE CARD SO EXACTLY EXACTLY. SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING US WE ARE THE LEAD AGENCY- ON THE CAL MEDICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT PROGRAM- AND JUST FOR REFERENCE THE COMEDY CARE ACT ABOUT SOME PROGRAM PROVIDES LOCAL INDEPENDENT ADVOCACY- TO CMC MEMBERS AND SINCE THE L. DOUBLE DOUBLES IN EACH OF THE SEVEN SIXTY I COUNTY- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COME TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK- YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PERSPECTIVES ARE REALLY INFORMED BY YEARS OF HELPING THE WORLD WILL CONSUMERS MAINTAIN COVERAGE AND ACCESS. NEEDED CARE AND SEE SEE I COUNTIES AND SO- EIGHT IN IN TERMS OF THE LESSONS LEARNED WE CERTAINLY HAVE. BEEN HAPPY TO OFFER PROVIDE THOSE THOSE LESSONS AND INSIGHTS- WE CERTAINLY APPLAUD AND SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S GOAL TO PROVIDE THE WORLD WILL CALIFORNIANS WITH INTEGRATED PATIENT CENTERED COORDINATED CARE. AND REALLY DO APPRECIATE THEIR- EFFORTS TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PLANNING PROCESS AS ENVISIONED MADE MENTION THAT THEY HAVE A SPECIFIC TOOL INTEGRATION ANALYST TO L. M. L. TSS WORKGROUP WHICH WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED ACTIVELY AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE- THAT OPPORTUNITY- THAT THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROPOSAL REALLY DOES HAVE TO BE APPRECIATED- IN AND IN PARTICULAR IN IN TERMS OF THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. THE WORLD'S BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE IMPACTED IN SOME WAY BY THIS PROPOSAL SO REDUCE IT YES- ARE YOU KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS POPULATION- MORE CHARACTER FLEA. POPULATIONS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE- AS A VERY COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. OF MULTIPLE CARE PROVIDERS- SPECIALIST THEY'RE BUILT TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- THE IN IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DOOR OLD WILL THE SPECIALLY THE FROM. LEFT NEXT AND COMMUNITIES. ARE BEING DIED HIGH. IN A DYING- DO TO COPE WITH THAT THIS BEFORE RATES THIS IS A- POPULAR- AND SO THE CON. OF THE- TRANS. WE REALLY EMPHASIZE THE VALUE IMPORTANCE OF SETTING AS A PRIORITY- MINIMIZING DISRUPTIONS TO CARE FOR THE WORLD PEOPLES- THAT THE PROCESS OF GETTING TO WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE IN THE TEENS THE- PLAN. IT IS FRAUGHT WITH WITH RISKS AND CHALLENGES AND SO WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY I'D BE HAPPY TO BE ON BOARD AND PARTNERING WITH THE CASE AT THE STATE- FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS OF THAT BUT- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE THOSE RISKS. IF. THIS IS A STATE WIDE- TRANSITION. AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WILL NOW FIND THEMSELVES IN MEDICAMENTO CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT JUST BY COMPARISON WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED CCI IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- THAT IMPLEMENT THAT IMPLEMENTATION WILL MEAN A FRACTION OF THE SCALE OF THIS. TRANSITION PROPOSAL SO DURING THAT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IMPLEMENTATION- YOU KNOW. WE ARE BOTH IN OFFICE AND IN OTHER ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE- A NORMA'S CONFUSION AND FEAR AMONGST THE DELIVERABLES THAT WE ARE INTERACTING WITH. AS THEY WERE INTERACTING WITH THIS PROCESS AND ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS CARE- THERE WERE THERE WERE DURING THE TRANSITION PROCESS THERE THE WORK WAS CONCERNED ABOUT- COVERAGE AND DESTRUCTION THE CARE- BACK IN IN MANY INSTANCES LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OR A LACK OF FIRED RATHER. TO TO THE PART OF THE PROGRAM ULTIMATELY- WE RECEIVED PUBLIC THOUSANDS OF CALLS PER MONTH DURING THAT FIRST YEAR FROM FRUSTRATED AND CONFUSED PATIENTS MANY OF WHOM COULD NOT ACCESS- SERVICES THAT THEY THAT THEY NEEDED HADN'T HAD. PROVIDERS CANCEL APPOINTMENTS FOR THE AMBER OR REFUSED TO SEE THEM DUE TO THE CHANGE OF THEIR COVERAGE- SO YOU KNOW WE DESPITE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS WHEN THAT PROCESS ROLLED OUT THERE'S JUST WERE NUMBER OF SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES- IT IMPACTS THE CONSUMERS AND WE HELP CONSUMERS THAT HAD- THEIR- COVERAGE DISRUPTED DURING CANCER TREATMENTS WE HAD. WE HELP FOLKS OUT. THERE WHO HAD PRE APPROVED AUTHORIZED- SURGERIES- ABOUT WERE CANCELED DUE TO THE- YOU KNOW DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE SURGERY DO THE CHANGE OF COVERAGE- AND FOLKS FACING AT THIS IT DIFFICULT ACCESSING NEEDED MEDICATIONS SO. REALLY THE EFFORTS THAT THE PLANNING GROUP IS MAKING TOWARDS AVOIDING THOSE DESCRIPTIONS IN THIS TRANSITION PROCESS ARE A REALLY- OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. OF TRANSITION- YOU KNOW WE REALLY- A RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT ROLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND- IT. ACCOUNT AND EVALUATE OF THIS PER. THIS IS A ANOTHER PRIMARY- OVERSIGHT. OF PLANS DO USE THAT SHE INCLUDE HIM DATA THAT THAT MEASURE WHETHER MEDICARE ALLEN THESE THAT PLANS ARE CONNECTING TOOLS TO NEEDED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND DOING SO EQUITABLY. LTSS UTILIZATION IS THAT JUST REFERENCE THIS- IS A VERY COMPLEX AND- FRAGMENTED SYSTEM AND SO THE COORDINATION OF THAT LTSS UTILIZATION THE REFERRALS. I'M EVEN EXPENDITURES- INCLUDING EXPENDITURES ON HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES REALLY MUST BE MONITORED AND TRACKED VERY CLOSELY- ADDITIONALLY EARLIER REFERENCE TO YOU KNOW BROAD BASED DEMOGRAPHICS DATA COLLECTION AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I ONLY JUST COLLECTING INFORMATION. BUT SELECTING AND SYNTHESIZING THAT INFORMATION WITH LOCATION DATA- SO THAT WE CAN REALLY TRACK THE INTERSECTION I'LL BE BETWEEN- DISPARITIES. AB OF HOW PEOPLE ACCESS CARE AND THEN REALLY SAID AS BENCHMARKS- FOR PLANS TO HELP REDUCE THOSE REDUCE THOSE EFFORTS. RELATEDLY THE PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AS WELL AS THE- CARE TO LIVE AS WELL AS THE CARE DELIVERY- PROCESS MUST PRIORITIZE REDUCING THESE DISPARITIES- SB EQUITY CENTER- DURING THE CCI DEMONSTRATION PROCESS THE RED NUMBER OF DISPARITIES THAT CAME TO BEAR- AT IN TERMS OF WHO PARTICIPATED. IN THE COMEDY CONNECT PROGRAM WHO OPTED OUT. AT YOU PART. THERE THERE WERE EFFORTS TO ENGAGE. AND RELATE TO NEW YORK I CAN OF AND L. E. P. COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THAT THAT WASN'T ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AND SO WE SAW HUGE- MASS OPT OUT OF DISTINCT- EXCUSE OF COLOR IN THE TO BE GOOD FOR FISHING PATIENTS THAT REALLY COULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THESE WONDERFUL SERVICES. LANGUAGE ACCESS BARRIERS AND LIMITATIONS OF PROVIDERS AND SOME PLANTS BIRDS AND SOME FURTHER CHALLENGES TO LDP POPULATIONS. AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN COVERED ON THE EQUITIES SO WE REALLY WANT TO PUT FORWARD EQUITY AS A PRIORITY TO BE BUILT INTO EVERY ASPECT OF THIS TRANSITION PLANNING- AND WE- WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR CONSUMER PROVIDER EDUCATION DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS THE KEY ISSUE. WITH THE PRIOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTICED THE MATERIALS TESTING THOSE IMPORTANT OF COURSE- ESPECIALLY REACHING OUT TO. SUCH A DIVERSE- POPULATION- AND INCLUDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND CONTRACT PROVISIONS THAT ESTABLISH BENCHMARKS AND TARGETS FOR REDUCING DISPARITIES THAT THE COMMISSION THAT PREVIOUSLY. FINALLY YOU KNOW WE FILL OUR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE WORLD WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE THESE TRANSITIONS. SO CONTINUING OUR COMPREHENSIVE ON BUTTON SERVICES PROGRAM WITH BILLS ABSOLUTE CRITICAL NOT ONLY THROUGH THE TRANSITION- WHICH WHICH REALLY IS STARTING IN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR MANY MANY BILL SO ELIGIBLE. BY TEARING THROUGH- THAT TO BE THE END GOAL AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BEYOND REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUPPORTS TO DO WELL DOUBLES. THAT NEED ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS INDIVIDUAL BEARS AND INVENTHELP EVENT WE CAN THEN TURN AROUND AND FLAG THOSE FOR THE STATE TO HELP ADDRESS- ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT TODAY. IF FIVE SEVEN QUESTIONS THAT. HAVE TO DO TO ANSWER THOSE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH PUSH THAT AND WE MAY COME BACK TO A QUESTION SO- OUR NEXT WITNESSES MY ALL. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO. HELLO AGAIN THE IT'S I'M GLAD I'M I'M FONG WITH MR DALY'S TESTIMONY BECAUSE- I THINK HE REALLY BROUGHT THINGS FRONT AND CENTER PUT IN FRONT AND CENTER AT THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDI CAL ON THESE FOLKS ARE POORLY SERVED IN CURRENT SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST PAID POPULATIONS. ON DATE THE LACK OF GOOD OPTIONS IN GOOD CARE FOR DUAL ELIGIBLES IS REALLY AN EQUITY ISSUE AS HE EXPLAINED AND JUST TO PUT A PEN AND SOME OF HIS CLIENTS ALL MY THE COUPLE'S REALLY TELLING STATISTICS- AS OF NOVEMBER BENEFICIARIES THIS IS NATIONWIDE- WHO DIED. OF COVERT NINETEEN OR DAHLE. NATIONWIDE THE RATE OF. DUE TO COLDER IS THREE TIMES HIGHER FOR DAHLE DOUBLES COMPARED TO THE GENERAL MEDICARE POPULATION. YES HE SAID THE OF DUELS ARE FORWARD AND MORE LIKELY TO BE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEY HAVE MORE HEALTH ISSUES AND CHALLENGES AND THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH MORE SIZE PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS. THE GENERAL MEDICARE POPULATION. I'M I SERVED ON THE MASTER FOR AGING STAKEHOLDERS COMMITTEE. AND THE NEEDS OF DUAL ELIGIBLES WAS A WAS A MAJOR FOCUS FOR US. ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS CALLING FOR PLANS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT BUSINESS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. REALLY A LONG TERM PLAN TO GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE INTEGRATED OPTIONS EVERY PART OF THE STATE. OFFER DUAL ELIGIBLES REACH COULD BE CASE PROGRAMS. SOMETHING LIKE HOW MANY CONNECT BUT BETTER WE'RE TRULY INTEGRATED DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLANTS. THIS RECOMMENDATION ALSO SPEECH THAT GEOGRAPHIC INEQUITIES IN THE STATE MANY RURAL PARTS THE STATE FARM HELP ABSOLUTE ALL AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF OPTIONS FOR- RANGES FROM LTSS OPTIONS TWO OPTIONS FOR INTEGRATED CARE. BUT EVEN IN URBAN AREAS THERE ARE MAJOR PROBLEMS- AND- AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY CRITICAL WHY. I SUPPORT THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS THAT THE DIS NEXT REALLY BE ONLINE AS THEY CALL IT- I DO ARGUE THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH CHOICE ON THE MEDICARE SIDE. I'M SIXTY FIVE AND I'VE BEEN A BOMBARDED WITH MAIL MAILINGS ABOUT MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS IN LOS ANGELES I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MORE THAN NINETY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE ALL THESE PLANS THESE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS- INCLUDE TOOLS AND THEIR MARKETING WHETHER INTENTIONALLY OR NOT. AT TIMES IT'S VERY MISSILE VERY MISLEADING AND CONFUSING FOR DOOR MEMBERS OFFER DAHLE BENEFICIARIES SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED I THINK IS A CURATED CHOICE AND LONG DISTANCE WITH THE COLLEGE THAT. AGAIN THERE MAY BE FEWER CHOICES FOR DUAL ELIGIBLES BUT IT WOULD BE REAL MEANS SO- DO A LOT OF TROUBLES AND AGAIN UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THEY CAN STAY IN FEE FOR SERVICE THERE'S NO PROPOSAL FOR PASSIVE ENROLLMENT OR MAKING PEOPLE OF ROLE IN R. D. STEPS AGAINST DAVIES FOR SERVICE WORK ON THEY WOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE TRULY INTEGRATED MEDICARE MEDICAID PLANS. ON. IF THAT'S WHAT THE AND WHAT WE WANT. I'M ANOTHER KEY. OF AND OTHER OF TOUCH ON ON THIS IS WHAT IS TRULY. TRUE INTEGRATION GO BEYOND JUST INTEGRATE MEDICARE MEDI CAL BENEFITS- THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IT MEANS INTEGRATING OR CLOSE COORDINATION OF HEALTH WITH LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. AND OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING AND FOOD AVAILABILITY. THE STATE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE ALIGNED YOU STEPS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED AS POSSIBLE. SO JUST ONE EXAMPLE ON LONG TERM CARE IT'S A FAIRLY VERYLEAST ANY ONLINE DO YOU STEP ON PASSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDED LONG TERM CARE. IS NOT THE DISTANCE WILL HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID LONG TERM NURSING HOME STATES. SO UNDER FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CHAO MANY CONNECT ON MY OUR PLAN HELP HELP THAT ESTIMATES HAS HELPED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF OUR MEMBERS MOVE OUT OF NURSING HOMES AND THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LONG TERM CARE- AND FINALLY- SIMILAR TO THE- TO THE DOCTOR THE LAST PANEL I WANTED TO POINT OUT. ON THE GROUND NO WE DON'T WORLD IMPACT AT THE INTEGRATED MEDICARE MEDI CAL CARE CAN HAVE. SO TODAY 55% H. P. S. M.'S ELIGIBLE- CAL MANY CONNECT TOOLS HAVE BEEN VACCINATED- WE THINK THAT'S GOOD PROGRESS BUT IT'S STILL LOWER THAN THE 75% FRACTION VACCINATION RATE FOR THE SIXTY FIVE PLUS. GENERAL POPULATION IN THE COUNTY OVERALL- AND IT WE THINK IT'S GOOD PRICE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ALL BUT THE DOOR WILL DOUBLE SPACED IT. ISSUE AGING BASED. ISSUES AND OTHER CHALLENGES. AND THE REASON WE CAN MAKE THIS KIND OF PROGRESS IS BECAUSE THESE MEMBERS ON ON YOU KNOW AND TRUST OUR PLANT WE'VE ENGAGE WITH THEM OVER MANY YEARS AND WE KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH THEM. SO ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS EARLY ON WE IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED- A TRUSTED ORGANIZATION THAT WE SUBCONTRACT WITH. THAT COMBAT SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OUR GOALS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHEN THE VACCINES- FIRST BECAME AVAILABLE THIS ORGANIZATION CALLED Y. CIRCLE WAS ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED OF OUR SPANISH SPEAKING. ARM ARM ARE ONLY TOOLS AND ENSURE THEY GOT TO VACCINATION OF POINTS WHICH WAS NO EASY TASK. SO I YOU KNOW INTEGRATED CARE WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE. YEAH I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN THE VEHICLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL WILL- WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT PROBABLY AFTER THE AFTER THE PANEL GOES THROUGH HERE SO THANK YOU- OUR FINAL MEMBER OF THE PANEL IS EVE GELB. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT MEMBER AND COMMUNITY HEALTH. SCAN HEALTH PLAN. AS THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND- I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP RIGHT ON WHAT MY SAID ABOUT FULLY INTEGRATED MODELS BECAUSE THAT'S- EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SO I AM- THE SENIOR VP OF MEMBER AND COMMUNITY HEALTH FORCE CAN HELP PLAN. AND PERHAPS A NEW PIECE OF VOCABULARY WE ARE WHAT IS CALLED A FULLY INTEGRATED DUAL ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN. SO THANK YOU STEP OUT WE HAPPEN TO BE THE ONLY ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT I FULLY AGREE WITH WHAT MIKE WAS SAYING AND WITH WHAT OTHERS WERE SAYING ABOUT FULLY INTEGRATED OPTIONS AND- OUT WE- WENT AROUND- LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA IS WHERE WE STARTED. OUT WE WERE FOUNDED BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF SENIORS- WHO THEIR REAL FOCUS WAS HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING HOMES. AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ORGANIZATION WE NOW SERVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND ELEVEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA- THEN. AS A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN M. A. T. T. PLANNED- BUT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF OUR BENEFICIARIES ARE DULY ELIGIBLE AND JULIE AND ROLLED IN OUR- PSYCHE SNAPPED IN THIS FULLY INTEGRATED MODEL. I'M AND IT BRINGS TOGETHER THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AS THE PHYSICIAN EARLIER WE'RE SPEAKING TO. ALL OF THE MEDICARE AND THE MEDICAID. OUTSIDE YOU KNOW A MULTI SET OF CALL MEASURES- WE ARE AND A HALF. WE HAVE BEEN MANY YEARS. I'M AT THAT IT YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR CAL. GET TREATED EQUITABLY HAVE CARE. AND HAVE FOR TO HAVE STAR QUALITY PLAN AVAILABLE TO THEM AND TO THE POINT THAT THE POSITION WAS MAKING EARLIER ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE- OF OUR STRONG PROVIDER NETWORK SO PROVIDERS JUST NEED TO PROVIDE CARE. WE DO ALL THE REST IN THE FACT HE'S NEVER WHICH IS THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. INCLUDING THE INTEGRATED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND WHAT THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER IT IS LESS THAN 1% OF OUR DUAL ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES ARE. ENROLLED IN A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY AND THOSE NUMBERS THAT MIGHT WAS MENTIONING BE ADAMANT RELATED TO CODE BUT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. AND OUR- YOU KNOW OUR- RIGHT AFTER I READ FOR BEING IS TO KEEP SENIORS LIVING HEALTHY AND INDEPENDENTLY IN THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BY. FULLY INTEGRATING. THEIR WHOLE PERSON NEEDS WHICH IS WHY I LOVE THE WHOLE PERSON MODEL I LOVE WITH THE STATE IS DOING WITH COUNTING- WHAT DH CS IS TRYING TO DO AND THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY'RE BRINGING TOGETHER. I'M STILL ONE LESSON WE DID LEARN FROM THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE WAS THAT PROVIDERS ARE KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND THEY INFLUENCE BENEFICIARY CHOICE. AND SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH A PRODUCT THAT HAS STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE PROVIDERS- AND ENABLES THEM TO YOU AS THE DOCTOR SAID DELIVER CARE REGARDLESS OF THE BENEFICIARIES COVERAGE THEY JUST KNOW. THAT. THEY NEED TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE. I KNOW LESSON WE LEARNED IS THAT BENEFITS CHOICES IMPORTANT SO I'M TO THE POINT AT THAT THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY WAS MAKING. THERE WAS A LOT OF. BENEFITS RETURNED WHERE FOLKS WERE DISTANT ROLLING FROM THEIR ASSIGNED PLANS- WE SAW. AMAZING STABILITY IN OUR MEMBERSHIP THROUGH THIS- TRANSITION BECAUSE WE ARE FULLY INTEGRATED BECAUSE WE PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS FREE CHOICE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY HAD. INTEGRATED OPTION- THAT MY IT WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE COUNTIES WE SERVE I'M IN THIS IS A GREAT OPTION ISN'T RIVERSIDE SAMBAR DINO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES. I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE LTSS OF DELEGATION- THAT ANASTASIA WAS TALKING ABOUT SO OUR MODEL HAS BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED- AND NOT ONLY HASN'T ALLOWED US TO ACHIEVE THOSE LOW INSTITUTIONALIZATION RATES THAT I TALKED ABOUT THAT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE LOWER ACUTE UTILIZATION LOWER READMISSION AND SO WHAT THIS MODEL DOES IT CREATE SAVINGS FOR BOTH MEDIC HOW AS WELL AS MEDICARE. I'M SO NOT ONLY IS IT YOU KNOW MODEL THAT PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY OUTCOMES IT. ALSO REDUCES COST. SO ENSURE AT KNOW ARM. FOR CAROLINE IS GIVEN THAT THE FIGHTING SNAPPED- IS- A MODEL THAT REALLY ENABLES POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH WHOLE PERSON MODEL THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT- OUR POPULATION THE SEGMENTS IN OUR POPULATION. REYES THE LINGUISTIC AT THE SOCHI NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION AND DELIVER CARE THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE INEQUITIES. IT IS ALSO FULLY INTEGRATED WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE NEEDS AND NOT JUST THE MEDICAL NEEDS BUT THE SOCIAL NEEDS THE SOCIAL SUPPORTS INCLUDING OUR MINISTRIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I'M AND I THINK THAT THEM THAT A MODEL LIKE THIS WHICH HAS BOTH CMS AND TEACH THE S. OVERSIGHT. PROVIDES THE GREAT LEVEL OF DENTISTRY PROTECTION. SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER DEPARTMENT TO. ALLOW THE GROWTH OF FIGHTING NAPS- AND TO ALLOW FIVE EAST NEXT TO FULLY PARTICIPATE. IT'S A MODEL THAT SERVES YOU KNOW ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY- BUT IN CALIFORNIA ONLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND SO I DON'T REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN DOING IN HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES. THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY I'M AND SO WE'RE ENCOURAGING THE GROWTH OF THAT MODEL TO MY LAST POINT THE GROWTH OF FULLY INTEGRATED OPTIONS WHETHER THEY BE PEACE VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; SNAP OR SOMETHING ELSE&lt;/c&gt; IN ALL COUNTIES- FOR THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE STATE- AND TO ALLOW THESE MODELS TO FORMALLY OFFER AND PARTICIPATE. IN IT LOOKS SERVICES- JUST YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE RAP BEST OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS DOCTRINA. SO I THINK I HAVE A COUPLE- FIRST ON THIS IS A WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO- AND HOPEFULLY ANSWER FOR US- THIS IS A COMPLEX AREA- MULTIPLE PAYERS- MULTIPLE PROGRAMS- AND MY READ OF THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL- IS THAT WE ARE NOW JUST REQUIRING. IT INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE TO BE A PART OF THE BENEFIT PLAN AND WE'RE REQUIRING IN A LINE D. SNAP AND MEDICARE HOW A MANAGED CARE PLAN- BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING ACTION ON THE CURRENT HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PROGRAMS- AND- IS THAT CORRECT- OR DISS PROPOSAL DO WITH HOME AND COMMUNITY. BASED SERVICES WAIVER PROGRAMS. SEVEN IS COOPER- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE PIECE THAT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY IS THE EXPANSION OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN- DONE IN BOTH THE CCI FORMS THE PLAN THAT'S REALLY AROUND THOSE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES THINGS LIKE PROVIDING MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS. HOME MODIFICATIONS SERBIAN LOVE SERVICES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL PARTIAL DUAL AND DUAL. ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND THE D. SNAP A PROPOSAL THAT IS BEFORE YOU. UPPER CONSIDERATION UP AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO GROWING- UP THOSE AREAS FROM THE COMMUNITY BASED OR- LTSS SERVICES IN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THEN AS WE GROW AND HAVE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY STATEWIDE THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CONSIDER A WHAT WE OFFICIALLY CARBON IN REGARDS TO BENEFITS- TO EVENTUALLY GET TO LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IS THE GOAL. OF A KIND OF BUILDING. AN INFRASTRUCTURE OVER TIME. SO AS AS- BEGIN TO FLESH THAT OUT. THERE WOULD BE CONVERSATIONS WITH. IT SO WE KINDA KNOW AS WE'RE GOING ALONG RATHER THAN. BOOM HERE IT IS. WE ARE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BUILD CAPACITY AND IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW IN OUR OPINION IS AS WE'RE BUILDING IN THE SYMBOL OF SERVICES REALLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THESE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES TRANSITIONAL SERVICES- THAT WE REALLY THINK WILL REALLY SERVE OUR DAHLE POPULATIONS VERY WELL- AND SO WHAT WE WHAT FULLY ENGAGE IN REGARDS TO ANY TRANSITIONS OF ADDING NEW BENEFITS ADD. TO THE MEDIC CAL A MANAGED CARE- RESPONSIBILITY- AS WELL AS WHAT THAT MEANS FOR NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVERS ARE MOVING FORWARD AS WELL A VERY CRITICAL A LOT OF THE PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE SERVICES IN OUR NINETEENTH THE ACTIVITIES THE RIVERS ARE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE WORKING WITH VERY CLOSELY TO FIGURE OUT BOTH THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA LEARNINGS FROM THOSE PROGRAMS AND CONNECTING THOSE RESOURCES TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN SO THEY CAN LEVERAGE THOSE ADS IN LIEU OF SERVICES. TO GO TO INCREASE THAT CAPACITY SO YES THE DEPARTMENT FULLY COMMITTED TO ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE GARCIA THOSE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE FUTURE OKAY- WHILE YOU'RE STILL THERE SO THE L. A. R. HIS RECOMMENDATION ABOUT MAKING A SETTING ABOUT MAKING A SETTING A MINIMUM STANDARD OF CARE FOR INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION OF THE SNAPS. WITH MEDICARE MEDICARE PANS WHAT'S YOUR REACTION. TO THIS. RECOMMENDATION I'M- I WILL THIS ONE UP TO NO SHE'S DOING A LOT OF THINKING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS ON THIS ONE AND SO AND A STAGE OR DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION SURE YES YOU CAN HEAR ME- THERE'S ACTUALLY ALREADY A MINIMUM SET OF REQUIREMENTS IN THE CURRENT- DECENT CONTRACT NOTICES SMACKED ANOTHER WORD TODAY- SORRY. ANYWAY SO BUT THERE THERE ARE ALREADY MINIMUM STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION THAT WE EXPECT THAT THESE NEXT TO COMPLY WITH. AND THEN WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING RIGHT NOW. ON UPDATING IMPROVING THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN WE WILL HAVE A MUCH BIGGER CONVERSATION IN OUR STAKEHOLDER GROUP FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE- TO HAVE- STRONGER REQUIREMENTS ADOPTING MANY OF THE INTEGRATION PIECES THAT WE HAVE FROM COMEDY CONNECT AND THEN- IN. INCORPORATING ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF CALAIS IN THAT ARE ALSO BEING WORKED ON ACROSS. MANY AREAS TO THE SMACK CONTRACT. GREAT THANK YOU- YOU ALL HAVE A PART TO HAVE A GLOSSARY FOR ALL THE- PHRASES YOU HAVE SO I WILL TELL YOU IN THIS IS A TRUE STORY- I HAVE. FOR A WHILE THOUGHT THAT MR MILLER WAS A REAL PERSON. UNTIL I UNDERSTOOD WHAT MISTER MADE REALLY MET A LONG TIME AGO SO- JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE JUST. I WOULD I DIDN'T ASK AND I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A REAL PERSON ANYWAY. THAT WAS BEFORE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE FOURTH PANEL DR ABDULLAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL FOR ON THE PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE JAILS AND COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES TO PROCESS MEDICAL APPLICATIONS AT THE TIME OF THEIR RELEASE. WE WILL HAVE FIVE SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING JC COOPER NET REZNIKOV KATHY CENTROLENE MCDONALD'S DAVE PUTNAM AND KATHERINE COHAN. IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN WITH CHASING COOPER. GET I'M AS I'M ROLLING THIS UP- ONE THING I WOULD JUST FLAG IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN ACRONYM BOOK AT DH CS WHEN YOU START HERE AND IT IS SIXTY FIVE PAGES LONG AND I THINK GROWING SO- DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON IT PLEASE SEND US A COPY WE LOVE TO HAVE A- THEREFORE IT GETS UPDATED ABOUT- WITHIN A MONTH BECAUSE OF HOW MANY NEW ACRONYMS WE APPARENTLY DECIDED TO ADD TO OUR- A BOOK EVERY DAY SO. I JUST WANTED TO. TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT- OKAY SO- ON ON THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE. I'M I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT THAT A FEW- INITIATIVES AROUND THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION JUST BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE WE- ARE LINKING A MALL HERE AND THEN. SPECIFICALLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE SO- THERE ARE MULTIPLE I'M JUST AS INVOLVED INITIATIVE ALL WITH THE A PROPOSED START DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TYPE HERE IT WOULD BE. THE TRANSITION OF ANY OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE I'M SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TRANSITIONING OVER ACTIVE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWO- BUT ESSENTIALLY- WE ARE PROPOSING TO ENSURE THAT ALL- INMATES. I RECEIVEDTIMELY ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES UPON RELEASE FROM INCARCERATION- BY PROPOSING TO MANDATE ALL INMATES COMPLETED MEDICAL APPLICATION PRIOR TO RELEASE- BUT- OF FROM INCARCERATION. AS WELL AS A MANDATE THAT JAILS AND COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES IMPLEMENT A PROCESS PERSON. IS STILL TAKING REFERRALS- AND LINKAGES FROM. INSTITUTIONS UPON RELEASE AND THAT COULD BE TO COUNTY SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH THEY COULD BE TO DRUG MEDI CAL. I'M DIAN CO DS OR THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY WERE RECEIVING- WHILE THEY WERE INCARCERATED- WE THINK IT'S A CRITICAL. A COORDINATION POINT THAT. REALLY NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. ADDITIONALLY ONE OF OUR CARE MAY- MANDATED TARGET PA. IS INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION I'M WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPLEX PHYSICAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE TRANSITION SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY I POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE OTHER MANDATES WITH IN. OTHER PROPOSAL I KNOW WE HAD MENTIONED THOSE IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS. WE ALSO HAVE A VARIETY OF THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WITH INDIA LIEU OF SERVICES WE WHICH EXPLICITLY CALLS OUT PEOPLE TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT LINK JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING THROUGH THIS. BROADLY AND HOW IMPORTANT CHALLENGES FOR THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS IN THE VARIOUS TOUCH POINTS IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT BOTH DIVERSION AS WELL AS MOOD REENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY. I'M TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE THE BEST HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE MOST SUCCESS AS THEY RE ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY. OF MANY OF THOSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE FOCUSED AROUND THE HOUSING PIECES RETRIBUTIVE CARE AND THE SHORT TERM- POST HOSPITALISATION. PIECES JUST APPLIED A FUME. YEAH THING I WOULD NOTE ON IS THAT WE DO PLAN ON REQUESTING APPROVAL TO AUTHORIZE A FEDERAL MEDICAID MATCHING FUNDS. FOR MEDICAID SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE. OF FOR ELIGIBLE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE SERVICES LIKE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BEING ABLE TO START THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE- THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THAT COORDINATION OF SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED- IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME LIMITED COMMUNITY BASED CLINICAL CONSULTATION OF SERVICES PROVIDED VIA TELEHEALTH. OR EAT CONSULTATION THAT COULD BE DONE AS WELL AS A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF MEDICATIONS FOR YOU ONCE THEY ARE RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT MEDICATION. UPON LEAVING- THAT THE JAILER PRESENT. THIS REQUESTED- IS UNDER THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED VIA THE SUPPORT ACT- AND WOULD ALLOW US TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE SERVICES. ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE THINK IT'S JUST- CRITICAL HERE IS ENSURING CONTINUITY OF HEALTH COVERAGE AND CARE FOR THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS IS A REAL HIGH PRIORITY FOR. US HERE AT DH CS AND I DO KNOW I IN CALIFORNIA BROADLY. THIS GROUP OF LOW INCOME INTO AS ADULTS IS JUST PROPORTIONALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO HAVE CONSIDERABLE HEALTH. CARE NEEDS ARE BUT ALSO OFTEN WHO ARE- WITHOUT CARE AND NEED MEDICATIONS UPON RELEASE I'M GONNA PROVIDE SOME SOME INFORMATION AROUND STATISTICS. ON SOME TWENTY EIGHT POINT 5% OF MALE PRISONERS ARE BLACK AS COMPARED TO FIVE POINT 6% OF THE STATE'S ADULT MALE RESIDENTS. FOR LATINO MEN THE IMPRISONMENT RATE IS A ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AS COMPARED TO THE THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN. OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN OF OTHER RACES. INDIVIDUALS LEAVING INCARCERATION ARE PARTICULARLY AT HIGHER RISK OF POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES JUST AS THE BALD INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE. HIGHER RATES OF BOTH PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES ENTERED A HIGH RISK FOR. INJURY AND DEATH AS A RESULT OF VIOLENCE OVERDOSE AND SUICIDE I'M MORE THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN INCARCERATED. INMATES YOU HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDER ARE MORE LIKELY. THAN THOSE WITHOUT AND YOU HAVE A DISORDER- OR HAD TO HAVE BEEN HOMELESS IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO INCARCERATION LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED PRIOR TO ARREST- AND MORE LIKELY TO REPORT A HISTORY OF PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL. ABUSE NEARLY 70% OF INDIVIDUALS RE OFFENDED WITHIN THREE YEARS AFTER RELEASE FROM PRISON. WELL THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RECIDIVISM ARE COMPLEXITY WE GET ALL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. AFFECTED TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CAN INTERRUPT THE CYCLE OF RE OFFENDING- BY WORKING TO ENSURE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS HAVE A STABLE NETWORK OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS UPON DISCHARGE- DH CS STRONGLY BELIEVES. THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A REDUCTION OF EMERGENCY ROUTE- YOU START SORRY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE. HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER MEDICAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RELAPSE AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF OVERDOSE RATES AND DEATHS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH OUT THERE THAT SHOWS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM JAIL DUE TO EITHER NOT. CONTINUING MEDICATIONS OUT OF WORK EXPECTED OR THEIR HIGH NEEDS OF MEDICAL SERVICES SHOP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS AND OR ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF BEING RELEASED INTO YOUR- ARE THE COMMUNITY. IF WE CAN INTERVENE EARLIER BY ENSURING THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL UPON RELEASE. AND MAKING SURE THERE ARE CLEAR COORDINATION PIECES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE DO THINK THAT WE CAN. GREATLY IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR THESE AND WELLS. ARE IN ADDITION TO SOME THE QUESTION AROUND PRE RELEASE OUT THE PER. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CHARAKA IS HAVING THREE RELEASE APPLICATION PROCESS BUT THE PROCESS IS NOT STANDARDIZED AND IT IS VOLUNTARY AT THIS TIME. I'M SO IT DOES VERY COUNTY TO COUNTY. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL- DH CS WILL STANDARDIZE THE COUNTY INMATE PRE RELEASE POLICY AND MANDATE IT FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- THIS WILL BE A COORDINATED EFFORT WITH PARTICIPATION FROM COUNTY STAFF THE JAILS. IN OTHER COUNTY AND STATE PARTNERS IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL I'M INCLUDING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WELL. IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IMPLEMENTING THE PROCESS IN EACH COUNTY WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE COOPERATION THE COUNTY HAS WITH JUSTICE INVOLVED ENTITIES I'M IN ASSOCIATED CONTRACTS. OF FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THIS COMPONENT WELL PART OF CALAIS BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS PLANNED FOR JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. DCS PLANS TO IDENTIFY THE REQUIRED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROCESS HOWEVER- THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO REQUESTING A FROM CMS TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY BUILDING. FOR THE COUNTIES YOU KNOW UP IN FIFTEEN WAIVER AS WE KNOW THIS BILL WILL BE A LARGE LEFT STATEWIDE BUT A VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL ONE AND SO SEEKING THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS. ARE FOR THAT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN. THE MANDATE- THE MAJORITY OF MEDICARE APPLICATION PROCESS SEIZE UPON RELEASE FROM JAIL- A BURKE COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES REALLY BUILDS ON A LOT OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE VOLUNTARY- APPLICATION PROCESS. AS WELL AS OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- WE HAD A NUMBER OF WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WHO REALLY YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS- THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED. VERY REALLY GOOD PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE KERN JEANS LOS ANGELES. MARIN MENDOCINO SAN JOAQUIN JEAN SAMMET. AND SANTA COUNTY. I'M INTO T. S. WITH THE APPLE WITH VERY COUNTY AND- BY COUNTY- AS IT CURRENTLY DOES TODAY SOME COUNTIES WILL USE COUNTY HIRED CARE COORDINATORS OTHERS USE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY STAFF TO ASSIST IN OTHERS HAVE CAUGHT- CONTRACTED WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE COORDINATORS WE REALLY WANT TO ALLOW FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE IT'S WORKED FOR COUNTIES TODAY IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY SET THIS UP- BUT LOOK TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THE BEST STANDARD IS ACROSS WHERE OF THAT VARIATION CAN EXIST. I'M IN NO THERE WILL BE A MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD- SO LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS WHEN IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM NED REZNIKOV WITH THE L. A. L. HELLO THIS IS NOT REZNIKOV WITH THE L. A- AGAIN I JUST A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- WE FEEL THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES HAVE MERIT AND DEATH THAT IT THAT IT. LINKS BACK TO THE CORE MISSION OF CALAIS AND THAT IT WOULD THAT CONNECT A HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS WITH- WITH NECESSARY SERVICES. HOWEVER THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER IT COULD CREATE A STATE MANDATED AND WHAT THE COST OF THAT WOULD BE. WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO SAY THAT IT WOULD CREATE A STATE MANDATE BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO POTENTIALLY KEEP IN MIND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY CENTRALLY MCDONALD'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN IT AND MEMBERS KATHY SAID KNOWING THE FINAL WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FOR PURPOSES OF THE PANEL I'M ALSO REPRESENTING COUNT AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES OR THE FACT OF THEIR MCDADE TANGRAM FEEDBACK AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON THE TALKING POINTS. HOW DO YOU STRONGLY SUPPORT POLICY LINKING AND MATES OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE PLANS UPON THEIR RELEASE. IT'S REALLY THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP FOR THIS HIGH RISK POPULATION I COULD IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS COUNTY SYSTEMS IN OUR OVERALL COMMUNITIES. FOR SAFETY REASONS THE SHERIFF MUST BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE OR DENY WHETHER AND NINE SHERIFF ENTITY MAY IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE ALSO ASK IN DEVELOPING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THE TOPIC HOW DO YOU ARE BE GIVEN FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROCESS OF THIS YEAR. AS MANY COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED MEDIC HELPED ME RELEASE ELIGIBILITY ACTIVITIES. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY- A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROCESS. AND WE- CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE PROCESS OF VISITING TAKING ME ACTIVITIES ONE STEP FURTHER AT THAT COUNTIES ARE ALREADY DONE WITH THAT WARM HAND OFF. OF ELIGIBLE INMATES TO HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS ON RELEASED MAKE FANS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP THAT PROCESS. THEY'RE ALSO OPEN TO BOTH IN NON CAN UNDER THE DOING WORKING A PER OF THE SHARE. BUT THE TRUTH AT THIS ENTITY MUST BE REQUIRED INTERFACE CLOSELY WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH% PLANS. TELL ME HUMAN SERVICES ELIGIBILITY STAFF AND OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND SERVICES AS APPROPRIATE AS WELL AS WITH THE MANAGED HEALTH CARE PLAN. HOW MANY LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS MUST INCLUDE AT MINIMUM PROPHECIES THE CEMENT APPLICATION TO COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. FOR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. AS WELL AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS TO ENSURE EFFICIENT LINKAGES. TO THE CRITICAL COUNTY RUN SERVICES THAT THAT RELEASED INMATE AND BENEFIT FROM. YOU DON'T NEED TO YEAH IT WILL BE SIX SOME LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THE DUTIES ASSIGNED BY A LOT OF COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. NAMELY CONDUCTING INITIAL AND ONGOING ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS REMAIN CLEAR AND ARE CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE ACTIVITY OF SUPPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL JUST TO EITHER FILL OUT THE END OR SUBMIT A COMPLETED APPLICATION. WHICH MAY BE DONE BY OUTSIDE ENTITIES SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CAL A PROPOSAL HERE. AND IN ADDITION TO THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WHICH WE AGREED WITH THAT INTERPRETATION THAT THEY ARE MANDATE. COUNTIES ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO MEASURE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POLICY PROPOSAL WHICH COULD INCLUDE PERHAPS- INCREASE RECEIPT OF SERVICE AS- PREVENTION OPPOSED TO CARBURETION OVERDOSE STAFF. OR OTHER OUTCOMES THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT TO SEE REDUCED RISK REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND OTHER APPROPRIATE MEASURES THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS MAY PROVIDE. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT CONCLUDES MY FORMAL REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM DAVE PUTNAM ASSISTANT. SHERIFF IN KINGS COUNTY. WELL THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK IT IS WE HAVE REACHED AFTERNOON YEAH I FIRST WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING WORKING VIDEO ON HIS COMPUTER AND I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY. YES SIR PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION- MY NAME'S DAVE PUTNAM ON THE ASSISTANT SHERIFF FOR THE KINGS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE- I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED WITH KINGS COUNTY FOR ABOUT THIRTY ONE YEARS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS AS THE SECOND IN COMMAND F THE AGENCY- MY PLEASURE TO GET TO SPEAK UP A BRIEF OVERVIEW ONCE ON SOME OF THE ISSUES- ON THE SHERIFF'S THE- SHERIFF'S OFFICE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IN KINGS COUNTY WE HAVE A MEDIUM SIZE JAIL WERE LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA- RIGHT BELOW- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA IS- TERRITORY IN IN- HANFORD IS OUR COUNTY SEAT ARE CURRENTLY POPULAR- POPULATION CAPACITY IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN INMATES- PRE COATED OUR POPULATION WAS CONSISTENTLY OVER SIX HUNDRED AND MANY TIMES AS HIGH AS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY. AND NOW IN THE MIDST OF CODE PROTOCOLS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP OUR POPULATION TO AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY. INMATES DALY. I APPRECIATE THIS OP. TO TELL. SOME POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN WHAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE PROCESS WITHIN OUR FACILITY. WE CAN SMALL COUNTY SUCH AS KINGS WERE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP UP THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND WE'VE DONE THAT AGAIN AND- PRIOR TO CODE WE WERE ABLE TO EMBED AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER. INSIDE OUR FACILITY AND THIS WORKER WITH THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER WAS PROVIDED WITH ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THE PENDING RELEASE REPORT. BOTH THIRTY DAYS OR SIXTY DAYS OUT ND- THIS PROCESS ALLOWED THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER TO REVIEW PENDING RELEASES AND DETERMINE WHICH INMATES MAY BE ABLE TO RE INITIATE OR INITIATE BENEFITS UPON. RELEASE AND IT WAS SUPER EFFECTIVE. THERE AUDITING OF THIS PROCESS WE DID MISS THAT TOO MANY INMATES ELIGIBLE SO NOW WITH CODE WHICH HAD TO TRANSITION TO A PROCESS OF A VIDEO BASED. PROCESS WHICH ELIGIBILITY WORKER CAN YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE- ATTENTION WE ELIGIBLE INMATES AND INMATES ARE PROVIDED WITH THE TABLET AND CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER THAT WAY TO REVIEW AND THIS OLD BUILDING WORKER IS STILL PROVIDED WITH RELEASE REPORTS AND THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE- INMATES PENDING RELEASE AND TO. RIDE THEM WITH AN APPLICATION AND ASSIST THEM WITH APPLYING FOR BENEFITS. AND I JUST WANTED TO ARTICULATE SOME CONCERNS GOING FORWARD AS WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR A CONSISTENT STREAMLINED PROCESS AND IT'S BEEN A GOOD SYSTEM WORKING WITH CLOSELY WITH OUR- COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. BUT THE CONCERN FROM A SHERIFF'S OFFICE STANDPOINT I THINK IS THAT WE MISS SOME INMATES HER IF THE PROCESS ISN'T SMOOTH AND STREAMLINED INCONSISTENT THAT- SOME ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE INMATES UPON RELEASE MAY FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS- A FLOCK. OF A POPULATION- SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT CONCERN AND I'D BE HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE KINGS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH HANFORD I USED TO WORK AT THE ADVENTIST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THAT'S THER AND HANFORD. NEXT WE'LL HEAR CATHERINE COHEN WHO IS THE STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. PLEASE BEGIN. HELLO THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS KATHERINE COLEMAN AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. WHICH ADVOCATES EDUCATES AND LITIGATE TO PROTECT AN ADVANCE THE HEALTH AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THAT DH CS IS TAKING EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS LEAVING INCARCERATION ARE CONNECTED WITH LOW COST HEALTH COVERAGE AND SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER. JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS HAVE HIGH HEALTH NEEDS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED PARTICULARLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NEEDS AND MEDICAL COVERAGE IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING CONTINUITY OF CARE BETTER POST RELEASE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND HELP SUPPORTS THE CALIBER PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE A MANDATORY MEDICAL APPLICATION PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS BEING RELEASED FROM JAILS AND PRISONS AND JUVENILE FACILITIES HOWEVER WE MAKE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE REALIZED. FIRST THE STATE MUST ADOPT A MEDIC CAL SUSPENSION RATHER THAN TERMINATION POLICY FOR ALL INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG IT THEIR CARS RIGHT. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES MEDIKAL TO BE TERMINATED AFTER ONE YEAR AT IN MEET STATUS AND THIS WOMAN ON SUSPENSION REMAINS INTACT IN THE CURRENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND HELP RECOMMENDS THAT SUSPENSION IT NOT BE TIME LIMITED AND INSTEAD THAT MEDICAL REMAIN SUSPENDED FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF INCARCERATION FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS. CMS HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT STATES CAN AND SHOULD SUSPEND RATHER THAN TERMINATE MEDICAID FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND HAS NOTED. THAT SUSPENSION PROVIDES FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE. IN ADDITION THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SUPPORT ACT WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY RT REQUIRE SUSPENSION FOR JUVENILES IN DETENTION FACILITIES AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX. THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES THAT STATES CONDUCT A RE DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY PRIOR TO RELEASE WITHOUT REQUIRING A NEW MEDICAID APPLICATION. WELL THE KALYAN PROPOSAL. MENTIONS THE DESIRE TO LEVERAGE THIS OF OR ACT IT BILLS TO STATE IN FOR. DO YOU SEE AS IS MEETING THESE KERN ABA UNDER FEDERAL. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE IMPLEMENTED OPEN ENDED SUSPENSION FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED INCLUDING THOSE IN STATE PRISONS. THIS WILL REDUCE CONFUSION CREATE CONSISTENT POLICIES AND MAKE THE SYSTEM EASIER TO IMPLEMENT. OTHERWISE COUNTIES AND FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IF THEY ARE COVERED BY THE SUPPORT ACT AND PROCESS PEOPLE THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES. SUCH AN APPROACH IS BURDENSOME AND IS NOT SOUND POLICY. SECOND WE ENDORSE DH CS IS PROPOSAL TO HELP INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ENROLL IN MEDIKAL PRIOR TO THE RELEASE AND RECOMMEND THAT THIS BE DONE FOR ANYONE NOT ENROLLED PRIOR TO INCARCERATION. THIS WILL REQUIRE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND THE COUNTY AGENCIES MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF ELIGIBILITY. THE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY LEAVES THESE UPWARDS OF TWO COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT WITHOUT CLEAR STATE GUIDANCE OR OVERSIGHT AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE PROPOSALS REQUIRE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES. AND AT DESIGNATED AND TRAINED STAFF OR SIGN IN TO CARRY OUT SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION IT DEFEATS THE US WANTS TO CONNECTING CARS RATED INDIVIDUALS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS CLEAR PROCESSES AND RESPONSIBILITIES MUST BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE SELECTION OF A MEDICAL PLAN PRIOR TO RELEASE. WE APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO COORDINATE PRIOR TO RELEASE TO CONTINUE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT BUT MORE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS WILL WORK IS NEEDED AS CURRENTLY MEDICAL ENROLLMENT AND THEN PLAN CHOICE IS A TWO STEP PROCESS. GIVEN THE FORTY FIVE DAY LEGAL LIMIT FOR AN APPLICATION TO BE PROCESSED THIS WOULD NEED TO START WELL BEFORE RELEASE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ENROLLED ON MEDIKAL WHEN THEY LEAVE JAIL OR PRISON. AND IF THE GOAL IS TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN A HEALTH. PLAN THE PROCESS COULD TAKE EVEN LONGER. THIRD WE RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE CLEAR POLICY HOW CONTINUITY OF CARE WILL OCCUR BETWEEN SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE FACILITY AND IN THE COMMUNITY POST RELEASE. SPECIFICALLY INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE CONNECTED WITH SERVICES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THE LOCATIONS THEY WILL BE LIVING POST RELEASE. AND IN ORDER FOR THIS TO HAPPEN SOME AGENCY OR PLAN WILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE IN A MEDICAL PLAN PRIOR TO RELEASE. OR MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN APPROPRIATE FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE TIME IMMEDIATELY POST RELEASE. ONCE AGAIN CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THESE CONNECTIONS AN APPOINTMENT IS NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL OF BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MEMBER QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. NO I MCKNIGHT I'M I'M FINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL TAKE A CHANCE IF I CAN THE ECHO IN ELEVATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM CASEY COOPER I THOUGHT SHE SAID IT QUITE WELL THAT THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION HAS HIGHER RATES OF PHYSICAL. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND FOR US TO HAVE EFFECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO INTERVENE EARLIER SAID MAY HELP TO PREVENT RECIDIVISM DECREASING YOUR USAGE AND DECREASE HOSPITALIZATIONS. BUT I'D LIKE TO DO AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT A LITTLE BIT IF I COULD ABOUT THIS LAST COMMENT FROM AND HELP ABOUT MEDIC MEDIC CAL SUSPENSION VERSUS TERMINATION AND ASK THEM THEIR LOGIC FOR WHY IT IS TIME TO LOOK. SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POLICY AROUND SUSPENSION VERSUS TERMINATION I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH AND HELP REGARDING. THAT PARTICULAR PIECE I THINK THERE ARE SOME- CONSIDERATIONS WERE MAKING IN REGARDS TO A FEDERAL OR FEDERAL PIECES THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE CLOSELY- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. ALSO BUT JUST KNOW THAT IT VARIES ACROSS THIS THE U. S. IN REGARDS TO HOW STATES HAVE DONE THIS WHETHER THEY- SUSPEND OR TERMINATE AT THE SUSPENSION TIME PERIODS WHETHER IT'S ONE YEAR WHETHER IT'S ON GOING OR WHETHER IT'S A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. IT DOES VERY STATE. TO SO JUST INFORM OUR THINKING AS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE- THIS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR THAT- WAS HOPING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE L. A. L.'S QUESTION REGARDING STATE MANDATES AND- WHERE THIS PROPOSAL SETS. I'M SO CURRENTLY ARE AS IN THE TRAILER BILL WE ARE MANDATING THAT THIS BE A REQUIREMENT TATEWIDE- FOR RELEASE FROM FROM JAIL- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A SHERIFFS AND COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT WITH THAT WE WILL THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE ON INCREASING OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THE COUNTY MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS. WE WILL HAVE FOUR PANELISTS WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT MOVEON TED NED RESNICK COUGH WITH THE L. A. L. KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD WITH C. W. DLA AND FINALLY DAVID CAIN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT. MISTER WELL LIGHT BORN DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ITEM- I WAS STRUCK. DR THE COLLEAGUES ONE OF SPOKE CAL WAS. SORT OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT THAT HE HAS SEEN- AND IT. UNSURPRISINGLY TOUCHES ALL OF THE SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF- INCREASING. EFFECTIVENESS AND- OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY- SO SAY THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT. ALL MY BEEN OF PROBABLY EVERY SIDE OF EVERY TABLE. IN THE COURSE OF ON MY. CAREER AND- AT THE TIME THAT WE MET A SIN ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WAS VERY IN THE ON MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY NEEDED TO REMAIN RESPONSIBILITY ALL. COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. ELIGIBILITY FUNCTION THERE. WELL SINCE ACA IMPLEMENTATION WE HAVE HAVE A NUMBER OF. WHAT FROM STATE LEVEL PARTNER LEVEL SEVERAL OF THAT HAVE SORT OF OBSERVED- ACCURACY ISSUES AND TIMELINESS ISSUES. MANY OF THOSE ARE FACTORED IN THE RESULT OF SYSTEM- PROBLEMS WITH THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM SO HERE'S SEVERAL CALAVERAS INTERFACE WITH SWORDS SO THOSE HAVE BEEN WORKED ON OVER. ALL THESE MANY YEARS READ MORE ABOUT. STANDING WORK GROUPS- DASHBOARD SO AS PART OF THE- SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA AND CAL HERE'S STFU BA- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO- THIS IT DOES NOT CREATE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS BROUGHT HOME. REALLY TO BUILD SOME PROCESSING GROUPS OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AND RESUME OF THE MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. WELL I'LL SPEAK WITH HIM OVER TO THE TIMING OF WHEN WE FORESEE DOING ABOUT ALL B. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL WHAT OUR COLONEL BILL. LANGUAGE DOES IS. BLUECROSS PROGRAM. IT THERE ARE DETERMINED TO BE OF ISSUES TIMELY OR ACROSS TO MOVE ON ADEQUATE PROCESS OF WORKS. ALL DEFINER PROCESS OF ENGAGED BETWEEN DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTY THAT MAY BE INVOLVED ALL THE DEVELOP SORT OF BALK CORRECTIVE ACTION OF SYSTEMS AND PROTOCOLS- AND THEN IT MAKES BERMAN HE- A PROCESS BY WHICH ON THE SCHOOL PENALTIES ON COULD BE ON. A POST- BUT ALSO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WOULD BE ONE IMPOSED ONE CORRECTIONS WAS. AND THEN IN KEEPING WITH THE SORT OF THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA PRINCIPLES OF TRANSPARENCY HAVING A SUITABLE CAL GRANT COUNTY DASHBOARD THAT WOULD BE. ON THE AGENCY OR WEBSITE- ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER. PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEDICAID SYSTEM SO ALL OUR PLAN OUTCOMES ARE DISPARITY OUTCOMES ON EQUITY SUCCESSES. AND THEN ALSO TIME- APPROVING APPLICATIONS RENEWALS WORKING ALERTS ON YOUR FARM WE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW JUST WHAT THE SIZE THAT WE SEE OURSELVES AS BEING ON CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COUNTIES AND US AND OUR GOAL IS TO. PEOPLE ALL SIX OF US WE'RE CLOSE THE SYSTEM. THERE IS A DEGREE OF- HOME URGENCY IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE WHILE WE HAVE WELL SEE A MOUSE MOST READ IT WE HAVE THE ALL ABILITY TO RECOUP ALL OVERPAID STORED ON THE NETWORK PAYMENTS YEAH. IT WAS CONDITIONAL ON ST OR LOCAL ERROR RATE EXCEEDING ABOUT JOSE ISCALCULATING YOU'RE RIGHT THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A PATH. THEY HAVE NOW- SETTLED ALONG THEIR PROCESS AND STARTING IN TWENTY FOUR TRUE- THEY I'M BEGINNING TO ASSESS- RECRUITMENT OF FARMING SO WE NEED TO BE SURE OF OR- CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCESS WORKABILITY. PROCESS IN PLACE- IN TERMS OF TIMING- WHAT WE ARE. DOING IS WE RECOGNIZE THAT HOME OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER TAPPED. ON PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING REDETERMINATION REQUEST WILL TELL THESE NOT TO BRIDGE PROMOTIONS- AND SO. A CRUCIAL ALL OF THE PREDICTIONS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE. MOVES- WHAT WHAT OVER A YEAR OR TWO GEN DO. THE SORT OF THE BACKLOG RETURN. ON AND BE ABLE SORT OF RESTORE NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICES AND SO NOT ACTUALLY BEGINNING THIS- IMPLEMENTABLE OF THE PROCESS- UNTIL. WE ARE A YEAR PAST THE END OF THE PHD BUT ALSO- HAS BEEN ADVANTAGE OF COINCIDING WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE- SOURCE MIGRATION- SINGLE SYSTEM SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE SURE THAT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED- SO LET ME STOP THEIR PARTICULAR QUESTIONS MMHM. DAHLE YEAH RIGHT. GET DIRECTOR LIGHT FORM NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM NED REZNIKOV WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HELLO AGAIN SO- COUNTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY STRUGGLED WITH- GETTING PERFORMANCE GOALS AND SO WE DO FEEL THAT SOME INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY IS WARRANTED. BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE RAISED LAST YEAR WITH THIS PROPOSAL ORIGINALLY CAME OUT. FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THE FIRST QUESTION IS- JUST WHAT ARE THE RIGHT PERFORMANCE MEASURES- TO REQUIRE COUNTIES TO MEET- THE ORIGINAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO PURSUE- ADDITIONALLY- ANOTHER QUESTION WOULD BE. WHAT ARE THE STATE'S- MAIN PRIORITIES FOR IMPROVING COUNTY PERFORMANCE AT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS ESTABLISHING SOME SOME KEY PRIORITIES- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES MAY STRUGGLE TO- ACHIEVE ALL OF THE- THE MEASURES THAT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY LACKING IN. THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS- WHETHER COUNTIES HAVE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES RELATIVE TO THE STATE'S EXPECTATIONS AND CONVERSELY- DOES DH CS HAVE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES RELATIVE TO THE- STATES EXPECTATIONS- THE LEGISLATURE- COULD CONSIDER REVIEWING AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO DEDICATE TO THESE NEW OVERSIGHT MEASURES. THANK YOU AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY CENTRAL IN MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH CWDM. RIGHT THANK YOU AGAIN- MISTER CHAIRS AND MEMBERS KATHY SANDERLING WITHOUT ALL THE THICK WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AS NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THERE IS EXISTING STATURE ON COUNTY OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING PROCESS THESE WHICH WE NEGOTIATED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WITH THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. TRANSACTION INCLUDES IMPORTANT PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT COUNTIES ARE NOT PENALIZED FOR THINGS BEYOND OUR CONTROL SUCH AS INCOMPLETENESS OF APPLICATIONS ARE REDETERMINATION MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY OUR CLIENTS OR TIED THAT'S TAKEN BY OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH IN TERMS DISABILITY FOR PURPOSES. OF APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BASED ON A DISABILITY DETERMINATION. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE PERFORMANCE OVERSIGHT PROCESS WHAT'S PUT ON HOLD FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS FOR REASONS THAT THAT BACK BACKGROUND PAPER NOTED I DO WANNA KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE OFFICE ITSELF WAS PART OF. THE REQUIREMENT COUNTIES OBSERVE AND WORK TOWARDS MEETING THE OUTCOME MEASURES WITH NOT AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT THE TO BE A WORK LIFE THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS WHO APPRECIATE HAVING THOSE OUTCOME MEASURES OUT THERE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE WITH THEIR STAFF AND SUPERVISORS TO HAVE GOALS. THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN STRIVE FOR. PROUD OF THE WAY WE DO I BEHALF OF STATE TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBLE FOR MORE THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WHICH IS ABOUT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION LAST YEAR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OCCURRED WE WOULD HAVE TALKED MORE AND I THINK BUILDING A WHAT DIRECTOR LAKE FOREST SAD. ABOUT NUMEROUS METHODOLOGY CONCERNS WE HAD WITH SOME OF THE FIRE AUDIT. AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON AUTOMATED PROCESS THESE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE DATA THAT WERE REVIEWED IN SOME OF THOSE AUDITS. WERE FLAWED AND HAVE SINCE BEEN CORRECTED I MERRILY ACCOUNT YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH ALEJO'S COMMENTS THAT COUNTIES HAVE LONG STRUGGLED TO MEET PERFORMANCE GOALS. WE BELIEVE THE PRIOR PROCESS WORKED WELL AND HELPED COUNTY HIGHLIGHT THOSE AREAS OF NEED THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON TERM PRO. BONIVA ENTERED INTO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TYPICALLY FOR NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO MEASURES OF THE TIME. AND WERE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE RESULTS TO THOSE PLANS AND HEIGHTENED OVERSIGHT. AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATE.OVERALL WE HAVE BROKEN A FREE. OF REVIEW PROCESS. WE DO INTEND TO PROPOSE SOME CHANGES IN THE LANGUAGE AND ITS CURRENT FORM. FIRST FOR GET REGARDING TIMING I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT FROM DIRECTOR MY BORN ON THE TINY. AND AGREED THAT COUNTY SO NOT BE PUBLIC PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CURRENT CASELOAD. GIVEN THE- P. EIGHTY FIVE. OR THE TIME WHEN WE STARTED BIG OUT AFTER THAT BOB HOPE EMERGENCY IS LIFTED. AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION OF HOW TO WORK WITH. THAT UPCOMING CHALFONT MIGRATION WHICH OF COURSE IS FEDERALLY REQUIRED. AND WILL RESULT IN SOME OFF WALKS OF CASES LATELY AS WE SORT OF MOVE BETWEEN THE SYSTEM. OF COURSE WE ILL ATTEMPT AND ALWAYS. O MINIMIZE THAT TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE HAVE ASKED FOR A INFORMATION FROM OTHER. OF IT THINKING REGARDING THE PUBLIC POSTING OF COUNTY PERFORMANCE DETAILS. ITSELF MAY NOT JUST BE MOST LIMITED TO THE EXISTING MEASURES BUT WE'RE NOT CLEAR ON WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE INCLUDED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET CLARITY ON THAT BEFORE ANY SUCH CHANGES THAT HAPPENED ON THAT SHOOT. ATTORNEYS UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL BE EXPECTED ABOUT. THAT I WILL ALSO SEND A PRIOR SYSTEM WAS CREATED QUITE AWHILE AGO AND BEFORE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA WAS ACTUALLY ON THE INTERNET AND AVAILABLE. SO UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT MIGHT BE SHOWN AND HOW OFTEN. THAT MIGHT BE UPDATED IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. I ALSO LIKE TO FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR PHD AT. THE MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM CHANGES ESPECIALLY WITH THE ACA. I THINK- AS I AS WAS NOTED THAT CAL AIM PROPOSAL WILL CREATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT. PART OF CHANGES TO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IN TWENTY YEARS IN THIS JOB. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON ELIGIBILITY. HAD THE BIGGEST IMPACT WE HAVE JUST SEEN SO MANY CHANGES. AND I WILL MENTION THAT WE'VE NOT HAD AN UPDATED REGULATIONS PACKAGE OF MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND ELIGIBILITY. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS A CONTINUUM OF LETTERS THAT COUNTY THE FEDERAL LAND OF THAT. IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR STAFF TO THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN MULTIPLE I'LL COUNTY LETTERS. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A PARTICULAR SITUATION. AND THIS CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION AND UNINTENDED DELAYS IN ELIGIBILITY OR OTHER ERRORS THAT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE FOR CLARITY. SO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT THE STATE WORK WITH COUNTIES TO ADDRESS. BOTH COMMON ISSUES THAT WE THREE I'M TRYING TO IMPROVE THE COHESIVENESS OF OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNTIES WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND FINALLY I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT EXISTING STATUTE OF THE LANGUAGE AND CAL EVEN WITH CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR COUNTY PENALTIES. WITH THE BENEFIT OF TIME WE HAVE THE STATE AMERICAN AFRICA COUNTY WHEN PROGRAMS LIKE HELL WORK. AND CHILD WELFARE THE FOCUS UP ON PENALTIES AND MORE IN CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS AND HE MEASURES OVER TIME. WITH SUCH PROPHECIES WHEN THEY ARE COUPLED WITH THAT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS ALSO PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU WORK WITH US AND WITH ADVOCATES TO CONSIDER WHETHER I THINK YOU AYE PROCESS. WOULD PERHAPS MAKE MORE SENSE AS WE RESTART THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PROCESS. RATHER THAN THE CURRENT PENALTY BASED STRUCTURE. FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS I AM ALBEIT HAPPY TO- MAKE FURTHER COMMENTS OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT WE WILL HEAR DAVID KAY. STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE- CENTER ON LAW AND- THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND THANK YOU CHAIR QUESTIONNAIRES AND DAVID CHANGED TURNING WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON PROPERTY WHERE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE WHICH DIRECTLY ASSISTS. MEDICAL PATIENTS AND ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS OUR STATE WE SUPPORT CAMPAIGNS PROPOSAL AT THIS GOAL TO IN HOUSE ENHANCE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY OVERSIGHT MONITORING- AND THAT'S BECAUSE AND MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY IS DONE RIGHT. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE APARTMENT YELLING YELL AT THAT COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THE MONUMENTAL CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNT OR CARD OVER THE PAST DECADE I ADD TO THE LIST THAT WE'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH- CAR WONDERFUL HEALTH FOR ALL EXPANSIONS FORCE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT TO KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT ARE CAL SUCH TRANSITION IS NOT LIKELY TO BE COMPLETE UNTIL MID TO LATE TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEN- YEAH PANDEMICS AND MUCH MORE HAS CHANGED SINCE THESE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ORIGINALLY ENACTED. AND SO NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING PROPOSAL. IS BROADER THAN SIMPLY ADDRESSING WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE PRIORITIES IN YEARS PAST AND BROADER THAN SIMPLY ADDRESSING PASSED AUDIT FINDINGS AND THAT IT DOES NOT FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON COUNTY ACTIONS. HERE'S WHAT. MORMON STANDARDS ASTOR AND THE BAND ALERT MONITORING PRODUCT AS WE- THAT OUR WAR. AFTER BUT THEY- THOSE MY CHANGES TO MEDICAL. AND THE ALSO FROM THE- PER. DO NOT COMPREHENSIVELY MEASURE OR MONITOR THE MOST COMMON DAY ARE YOURS AND OBSTACLES THE CALIFORNIANS FACE. ONE MEDIC COUNTY IS A ROW ISLEY DID NIGHT DISK. OR IT AND WORDS WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE IN ERROR. SO LIKE THE LEGISLATURE ASKED TODAY AT THE AGENDA WE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED WITH THE LEGISLATURE COUNTIES ADVOCATES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING TO PROTECT AND GUARANTEE ACCURATE AND TIMELY MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY. CHECK THIS ONE EXAMPLE AFTER THIS CALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HANDS MOST OF THE CURRENT THIRTEEN MILLION PLUS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WILL BE SUBJECT AGAIN TO ANNUAL RENEWABLES. THAT MEANS NEARLY A MILLION DETERMINATIONS EVERY MONTH PLUS NEW APPLICATIONS AND MAYBE COMING AT AND UNDER THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 90% OF RENEWALS MUST BE COMPLETED WHEN INFORMATION IS SUSPENDED AND NOTICES SENT APPROPRIATELY. THIS MEANS THAT WOULD FIT IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO EVERY MONTH APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS GOOD AFTER MEDIC CALDERON EASILY CUT OFF AND UNDER OUR EXISTING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ALL YOU WOULD SEE. IS A PASSING SCORE. SO THE ISSUE THE IS THAT PER STATE. THAT MEASURE IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO GUIDE OPERATIONS AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY TODAY. BUT IT FALLS SHORT OF WHAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS NEED TO SAMPLE WEIGHTS ALLOWS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND IT DOES NOT MEASURE WHEN YOUR ELIGIBILITY IS ACTUALLY DONE CORRECTLY OR RIGHT. THAT'S WHY MOVING FORWARD CONSUMER ADVOCATES ARE EXCITED TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WITH COUNTIES THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO BEST DESIGN IS CALLING PROPOSAL ON OVERSIGHT MONITOR. WE HAD IDEAS ABOUT HOW EXISTING QUALITY CONTROL EFFORTS CAN BE UPDATED ABOUT HOW INVITATIONAL MONITORING METRICS CAN BE ADDED TO CONFIRM THE ACCURACY. OF ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS NOT JUST THE TIMELINESS. ADDITIONAL WAYS TO MONITOR ERROR RATES WITHOUT PENALTIES FOR COUNTIES BECAUSE WE THANK FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE PENALTIES FOR COUNTIES ULTIMATELY CORRECT APPLICATION. AND BENEFICIARIES AND SENTENCE FOR COUNTIES WOULD BE MUCH BETTER. WE ALSO HAE IDEAS ABOUT HOW THESE MEN'S ALERTS CAN BE CHANGED AND UPDATED SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT IMPACTS CONSUMERS MOST SEVERELY WHEN THERE IS A MENTAL ERRO. WE ALSO WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN HOW THE DEPARTMENT CAN BE TAKEN ADDITIONAL STEPS TO SUPPORT COUNTY OPERATIONS. AS KATHY WAS DISCUSSING. SO THESE ARE CALM AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR MEDICAL. APPLICANTS AND BENEFICIARIES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO REFINE THEM FURTHER IN A COLLABORATIVE WORK GROUP WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND- THANK YOU SIR- I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS I WILL BEGIN BY APPRECIATING DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN- YOU PROVIDING THAT TIME LINE FOR WHAT OCCURS- POST OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK ONE QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S A FOLLOW UP OF WHAT. MISTER KANE WAS JUST SAYING. AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE PUBLIC FACING REPORT CARD OR DASHBOARD HOW'S THE DEPARTMENT PLANNING TO INVOLVE CONSUMER IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE INITIATIVES TO ENHANCE ITS OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING. FIRST I MEAN I THINK I WOULD. NEED TO NOTE THAT WHEN THE CALLING PROPOSALS IN ITS OWN ANA WELL STAKEHOLDER DEVELOPMENT PROCESS- ON THIS. YEAR JUST PAST YOUR PRIME ALONG THESE STAKEHOLDERS WORK WERE INVOLVED IN- I THINK THAT THERE IS I THINK KANE- CORRECTLY SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN- OPEN TROOPS OR DARE MEASURES THAT. BETTER CAPTURE YEP PROBLEMS WE'RE WALKING AND WE YOU KNOW I FULLY EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE ALL IN DIALOGUE WITH OUR COUNTY BOARD MEMBERS AND WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS- INCLUDING CONSUMERS- THROUGH REFINE REFINE THOSE THEY HAVE TO BE- ASSEMBLY WITHDRAWALS COMMENT- THAT THEY NEED TO BEING- I THINK YEAH IN THE SPIRIT OF. CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT A POEM AND SO ARE I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS WE WORK THROUGH- ACTUALLY DEFINING PROCESS OVER THE SUMMER AND FALL. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWERED DIRECTOR AND HAVE ALWAYS APPRECIATED YOUR TRANSPARENCY CANDOR AND PROCESS AND WORKING THROUGH MANY OF THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUES SEX AND I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FIVE. PANEL SIX IS ON INCREASING DH CS OVERSIGHT OVER THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND THE CHILD HEALTH AND DISABILITY PREVENTION PROGRAM. WE WILL HAVE THREE SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH TRACY COOPER. FOLLOWED BY MICHELLE GIBBONS AND SKYLER ROSELLINI CAN YOU BEGAN THIS COOPER. SO WHEN WE WERE LOOKING ACROSS ALL OF THE VARIOUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHEN ARE LOOKING AT KILLING WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE ALSO LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND CHILD HEALTH AND DISABILITY PRVENTION PROGRAM. I'M TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN STANDARD REQUIREMENTS ACROSS A PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AS YOU'RE PROBABLY VERY WELL AWARE CCS IS THE OLDEST PROGRAM AND MEDIC CALLIN EXIST ACTUALLY BARBER. BEFORE MEDIC CAL EVER WAS IN PLACE- SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE BEST SERVED- WHEN THEIR CARES KIND OF DELIVERED IN A IN A STANDARD WAY TO KIND OF CONSISTENT ACROSS OF IT TO ME MEET ALL OF THEIR NEEDS SO WE DO PLAN ON- YOU KNOW. I GUESS I SHOULD STEP BACK WE CURRENTLY DO CONDUCT REGULAR MONITORING WITH OUR COUNTY PLANS AND- THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A FISCAL A GUIDELINE PROCESS- WE MEET WITH THEM REGULARLY WE HAVE A CCS ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE- AND WE DO WORK TO KIND OF ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS- INTO CONDUCT SOME AUDITS. TODAY HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT WE INTEND TO DO WITH THIS CHANGES REALLY ENHANCE THE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THREE CITIES- TO PROVIDE- YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY A STANDARD OF QUALITY OUTCOMES IF WE'RE EXPECTING IN THE CCS PROGRAM- ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE- WE ALSO- WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTS IN PLACE. WITH COUNTIES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES TIMELINES AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND BOTH CCS IN C. H. D. P. TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A STANDARD OUTCOME ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE ALSO WILL BE DEVELOPING AUDITING TOOLS TO USE. IN THAT PROCESS WILL WORK. VERY COOPERATIVELY WITH THE COUNTIES AND THE THAT- OPERATING THOSE AREAS TO AND- THIS PROCESS YOU IT'S WHY THE- I AND CAL MS OVER MULTIPLE. THAT WE CAN OF ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IDENTIFY OF THE VARIOUS COMPLIANCE AREAS WHAT WE WILL BE EVALUATING.I'M AND WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS I THINK ONE THING THAT WE HAVE- IF KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN REGARDS TO. THE STANDARD- TURNAROUND TIME FOR EXAMPLE FOR AUTHORIZATION OF SERVICES SOMETIMES IN CCS DEPENDING ON WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAN TAKE- MANY WEEKS IN ORDER TO GET THOSE AUTHORIZATIONS IN PLACE. HOWEVER IN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE CLEAR REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO TURN AROUND TIMES WITHIN THREE DAYS URGENT. REQUESTS AND FOURTEEN DAYS FOR STANDARD REQUEST SO WHILE WE MAY NOT BE THERE YET I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS WITHIN THESE VERY CRITICAL PROGRAMS FOR SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S. MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTIES AS WE DEVELOP WITH THOSE STANDARDS ARE WHAT WE WILL EVALUATE. AND THEN WORK TOGETHER AS WE- IMPLEMENTED A BOTH AUDITING AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY FUTURE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS- IN THOSE AREAS. AND THAT IS THE END OF MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE. I YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MICHELLE GIBBONS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION. OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOUNG GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MACHEL GIVENS AT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER BOTH THE CCS OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES AND CHILD HEALTH AND DISABILITY PREVENTION PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. THE PROPOSAL WITHIN CALLIN TO ENHANCE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF CCS IN C. H. T. P. DON'T YET HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHAT ENHANCE OVERSIGHT AND MODERATE MONITORING MEANS. IN ORDER TO INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING BOTH IN THE CCS IN C. H. T. P. PROGRAMS- THE STAFF AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEVEL MUST FIRST HAVE A BASE LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE'S EXPECTATIONS FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND CLEAR DOCUMENTS AND ADD POLICIES THAT GUIDE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE PROGRAMS. AS MISS COOPER MENTIONED CCS IS THE OLDEST PROGRAM UNDER DH CS IT'S IT IN TO BE QUITE HONEST IT'S CLUNKY AND REQUIRES LEAVING THROUGH A HOST OF NUMBERS LETTERS AND POLICIES THAT ARE SUPERSEDED BY NEW POLICIES OVER TIME AND ARE EXPERIENCIAS ADMINISTRATORS ARE REALLY THEY'RE ABLE TO CROSS WHAT THE DIFFERENT POLICIES. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE GUIDING POLICIES AND DOCUMENTS ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND THAT THERE'S TRININGS TOOK TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS STAFF TO IT AS UPDATES ARE BEING MADE- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT DH C. S. B. HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THEIR KIND OF GUIDING DOCUMENTS AND POLICIES. AND THEN THEY HAVE ALLOWED OPPORTUNITIES FOR- STAKEHOLDER INPUT WHICH IS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND HOWEVER THE ONE THING I WOULD NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR LIKE THAT THE BREATH OF ALL THE POLICIES THAT THEY INTEND TO REVISIT IN THE TIMELINE FOR WHEN EACH OF THOSE THINGS WHAT HAPPENED SAID SO I TIMELINE AND A PLAN OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO CONVENE OR THE STATE CONVENE CCS IN C. H. T. P. PROGRAMS AS WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS CAPTURING ALL OF THE CRITICAL POLICIES AND THAT THERE IS AN AGREEMENT ON HOW THIS PROCESS WILL WORK. UNDER CCS I JUST WOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS AND SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL OVERSIGHT LOOKS LIKE VERSUS. THE CLASSICS ECS COUNTY OVERSIGHT LOOKS LIKE- AND ALSO THAT WE'RE- HELD STANDARDS OF THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR- MISS COOPER ALSO MENTIONED THE TIMELINESS OF AUTHORIZATION SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS. RELY ON THE STATE TO HELP. COMPLETE AS AN END OF THAT AUTHORIZATION SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ONLY BEING HELD TO THE PROCESSES THAT ARE WITHIN THE COUNTY OR THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CONTROL. A WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO CONSULTING WITH COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS GREATER OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING. I CHECK WHICH STRESSED THAT ANY NEW AUDIT TOOLS ARE KIND OF BILITY MEASURES A NEW DOCUMENTATION. REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNTIES BE PROCEEDED WITH THEIR- TRAINING AND SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE STAFFING TO MEET THESE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE LOOK AT. ADDING RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT WE ALSO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING ADEQUATELY FUNDED. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- IS SPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC ARE BEING STRETCHED QUITE THIN. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE HONORING ON RAMP TO OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN ABILITY TO BRING EACH JURISDICTION INTO COMPLIANCE WHATEVER THAT MEANS- BEFORE THEY START BEFORE THE STATE INSTITUTES FINES AND PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE. AND SIMILAR TO THE SPEAKERS ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE WOULD FURTHER ASK THE STATE TO CONSIDER QUALITY OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. VERSUS A SHIFT TO FINES AND PENALTIES I WE URGE THIS PROCESS TO INCLUDE A REMEDY AND- AN ABILITY TO REMEDY AND CARE FINDINGS AND THE DH CS BE ADEQUATELY STAFF TO. RESPOND TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR JURISDICTIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL DETAILS BECOMING AVAILABLE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE ABREAST INFORMED AS THINGS PROGRESS. I AND WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER FLESH OUT THE DETAILS IN THE PROCESS- AND SO THAT WE ALL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. THE GREATER OVERSIGHT. AND MONITORING MEANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM SKYLER ROSE A LEVY. SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. GOOD AFTERNOON A DOCTOR'S WEDDING ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY MY NAME IS KILEY WRESTLING INTO A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. THAT'S MY COLLEAGUES EARLIER AS STATED I AND HELP PROTECTS AND BEYONCE'S THE WHOLE CARE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. I KNOW THIS THIS THIS PROGRAM IS A CRUCIAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS AND SEVERE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND ILLNESSES IT PROVIDES DIAGNOSTIC TREATMENT SERVICES MEDICAL CASE MANAGEMENT AND PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SERVICES TO CHILDREN UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE WITH A QUALIFYING CONDITION. UNFORTUNATELY SEES JUST REMAINS A COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING PROGRAM TO NAVIGATE WELL AND HELP SUPPORTS THE KIND PROPOSAL IN A COMPANY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASED OVERSIGHT MONITORING AND MUST GO FURTHER TO PROTECT CCS ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY MEDI CAL. ALTHOUGH MEDICAL COVERS THESE DAYS HAVE SERVICES THE VARYING STRUCTURE OF SERVICE DELIVERY EACH COUNTY CREATES EXTENSIVE COMPETITION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY ONE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM COUNTIES THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL REPAIRS MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ADMINISTER SINCE YESTERDAY SINCE AND ALL STATES HAS BEEN FISHERIES ARE BOLD. AND THAT CAUSED ME. SINCE THE HOTEL. ESTEEM RESPONSIBILITY FOR TO LET OF C. WILL. AND NON C. STEPS RELATED SERVICES. THE POINT OF ACCOUNT. IS WITH THE MEDIC HEALTH PLAN. HOWEVER IN THE MAJORITY OF. ARE NINE CODES IS RESPONSIBILITY ADMINISTERING CCS INSTEAD OF REST WITH THE COUNTY OR DTS. DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION SIZE. CURRENTLY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ONLY MANDATES INCREASED OVERSIGHT OVER COUNTY'S ADMINISTERING CCS PROGRAM GIVEN THAT CCS IS IT MINISTERED BY MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND TWENTY ONE WE'LL TELL NOT COUNTING. THE LANGUAGE MUST INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS FURTHERMORE HOW WILL TEACH THIS MONITOR ITS OWN CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH IS STILL RESPONSIBLE AND SMALL POPULATION COUNTS. INCREASED OVERSIGHT OVER CCS WEATHER BY COUNTY MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR DCS IS NEEDED TO ENSURE MARKETABILITY REGARDING ACCESS QUALITY AND OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICE DELIVERY TO NECESSARY COVERED SERVICES FOR CCS CHILDREN. MORE TRANSPARENCY IN DATA COLLECTION IS ALSO NEEDED TO EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF STEVE'S DEATH BETWEEN COUNTIES IT IS IMPORTANT TO A WIDE DOUBLES WITH MEDIC CAL TO ENSURE COORDINATES QUALITY CARE FOR CHILDREN BUT COMPLEX CALLUSES AND DISABILITY. MANY GAPS WITHIN STATES YES EXISTS DUE TO THE LACK OF POLICY GUIDANCE IN ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT NINETY COS FOR EXAMPLE ACCESSING DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OR SUPPLIES IS COMPLEX BECAUSE IT MUST BE PRESCRIBED BY CCS PANEL PROVIDER. I SEE SAYS THE GROUP IS STILL ANY. HOWEVER THE REALITY IS A CCS ELIGIBLE CHILD NEED FOR DME MAYBE IDENTIFIED BY DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CHILD IS ENROLLED IN A FULL CHILD MODEL OR NOT WE'LL TELL BONTA COUNTY. CONFUSION BASED ON LACK OF CLEAR GUIDANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY RESULTS IN DENIALS OF NECESSARY DAMPING AND OTHER SERVICES AND THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO MEDICAL MOVES. EVEN WHEN THE CHILD HAS MEDICARE. OTHER ISSUES. WITH STATES YOU TO PROCESS RIGHT THE CHILD THE RIGHT TO APPEAL AND NEGATIVE ACTION. BY COUNTY MODEL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND WHETHER THE CHILD IS ON MEDICARE OUR HAS ANOTHER SOURCE OF HEALTH COVERAGE. SOME BENEFICIARIES CAN APPEAL FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT'S ALL THE STATE. AND NONE WILL HELP MODEL COUNTIES. THERE'S A SEPARATE APPEALS PROCESS LET'S SEPARATE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS IN SEPARATE REQUEST HIGHLIGHTS. OF THE STATE'S CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL AND MAGICALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BOTH APPEALS PROCESS IT'S CONFUSING. THERE IS NO COORDINATION OF POLICY GUIDANCE BETWEEN CCS AND MEDIC CAL THIS LEADS THE POLICY CONTEXT AND INCONSISTENCY. IT'S GAPS ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED BY COUNTY ARE COUNTING TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL IS TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY ABOUT THE CONSISTENT AND SEAMLESS SYSTEM DISTILLS MUST EVALUATE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTERING CCS BENEFITS AND HELP STRONG SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL FOR INCREASED OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE'S JUST PROGRAM. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE STATES YES WORKS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE LEFT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT DOES CONCLUDE THIS PANEL I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR A QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF I COULD THAT IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE BUREAU OF STATE AUDITS RELEASED AN AUDIT. ON DH CS WHICH WAS TITLED MILLIONS OF CHILDREN MEDIC CAL. ARE NOT RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON WHAT LESSONS WERE LEARNED FROM THIS AUDIT AND WHICH RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENT HAS ADOPTED. I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE AUDIT REPORT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. IMPLEMENTED EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN REGARDS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. WE HAVE A GREATLY STRENGTHENED SOME OF OUR CONTRACT LANGUAGE WE HAVE MORE CHANGES COMING IN THE FUTURE GARCIA ACCOUNTABILITY ON THAT FRONT. WE ALSO ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS THE REQUIREMENT TO DO DIRECT OUTREACH TO BENEFICIARIES REGARDING GAPS IN CARE. OF AS WELL AS EVEN CALLING INDIVIDUALS TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHT TO THOSE SERVICES- WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT MANY OF THE CHANGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO. EVEN CHANGES TO THE HANDBOOK OR THE MANUAL THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE WHEN THEY'RE ROLLED IN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS TO THOSE SERVICE AS- UP FOR EXAMPLE. AND EXTENSIVE CHANGES ACROSS MULTIPLE DCS DOCUMENTS WEBSITES- STATUTE EXAGGERATE JUST ENSURING THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHAT ARE THOSE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO- SO WE'RE HOPEFUL ON THAT WITH THESE CHANGES WILL SEE. INCREASES IN THE FUTURE I WOULD NOTE ONE OF OUR IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT WE NOTICED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DURING HOPE IT WAS A REDUCTION OF CHILD TWELVE IS IT- WELL THIS VISITS. AS WELL AS IMMUNIZATIONS AND WE RECOGNIZE THIS IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY IMMEDIATELY AND STARTED AS INDICATING IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE MEETING PUBLICLY THAT WE HAD AS THE DEPARTMENT TO PUT PEOPLE. IN BECOME AWARE OF THESE DECREASES. AS PEOPLE START RE ENGAGING IN HEALTHCARE WILL BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY IN REGARDS TO SEEN CHILDREN'S CHILD WELLNESS VISIT A VISITS INCREASE- IN IMMUNIZATION RATES INCREASE WE STILL HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP JUST TO BE CLEAR- AND SO WE WILL. WE WILL BE WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY WE ARE RECORDING THOSE METRICS ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS NOW PUBLICLY A SO THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY GET CHILDREN AND FOR THOSE NEEDED VISITS AND IMMUNIZATIONS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OTHERS AS WE CONTINUE TO- CLOSE THE GAPS THAT WERE THERE- BEFORE COULD. AND THEN THE LARGE GAPS THAT WERE CREATED THE POP HEALTH EMERGENCY IS. THANK YOU OF FINAL A I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAMS. COMMENTER QUESTION REGARDING OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND HOW THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE AFFECTING THE WAR IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT YOUR- SO IF WE IDENTIFY ANY AREAS- THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL AND CCS PROGRAM OF COURSE WE WOULD. IMPLEMENT THAT ONE THING I WOULD SAY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN MANAGED CARE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR CHILDREN- CCS CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL PROGRAM THEN- IN D. AS STATE ONLY AND OR THAT THE P. FOR SERVICE AS CCS PROGRAM AND SO. SOME OF THIS INITIATIVE IS ACTUALLY JUST ELEVATING TO THE SAME LEVEL OF- GRIEVANCE APPEAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST AND ARE REQUIRED IN MANAGED CARE AND I THINK IT BECAME VERY CLEAR TO US WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHOLE CHILD MODEL SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE EXISTED FOR THE CCS CHILDREN. THAT HAVE BEEN CARVED OUT TO FEE FOR SERVICE- AND SO I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WERE LOOKING TO KIND OF CLOSE THAT GAP IN REGARDS TO THOSE CHILDREN STAYING WITHIN THE CCS PROGRAM- AND- WE HAVE STARTED POSTING. REPORTS FOR EXAMPLE ON WHOLE CHILD MODEL OF AND WE WILL BE GETTING SOME DASHBOARDS FOR CCS UP AS WELL AND START LOOKING ABOUT- THOSE THOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS NOT JUST. NOT JUST FEE FOR SERVICE OR MANAGED CARE BUT HOW WE'RE SEEING THOSE METRICS PLAY OUT BOTH IN CCS TRADITIONAL. AS WELL AS WHOLE CHILD MODEL. THANK VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ENTIRE. PANEL SIX. AS WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN IMPROVING MEDIC CALBENEFICIARY CONTACT. AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WE WILL BEGIN AGAIN WITH YOU MISS COOPER. THANK YOU. SO YOU KNOW WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AS WE WERE DEVELOPING A CALENDAR AND TALK TO OUR PLANS COUNTIES PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES I'M ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENT THINGS RAISED- IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WAS THE NEED TO IMPROVE CONTACT AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. OF THAT WE PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES TO PLANS PROVIDERS- AND COUNTIES IN ORDER FOR THEM TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE OF THEM IN REGARDS TO OUR REACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- IT WAS. EXTREMELY CONSISTENT IN REGARDS TO HEARING THIS WHETHER IT WAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THE COAST- IT WAS A CLEAR MESSAGE AND SO I IT'S WHY IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF TALLY MANY INTERWEAVES WITH SO MANY OF THE PIECES THAT WE- ARE DOING. I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER DRIVING FACTORS BEHIND THIS- HAS BECOME EVEN MORE. RELEVANT TODAY AS WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AS WE REALLY WORK TO CLOSE. EQUITY GAPS IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AND COLLECT THE BEST A DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THAT WE CAN INCLUDING RACE ETHNICITY A LANGUAGE ETCETERA A TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION WE CAN'T YOU- TO LOOK AT AT THE AT METRICS VIA- AN EQUITY LENS AND TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS. I MEAN FEEL COMFORTABLE AT THAT LEVEL OF COURSE WE'RE STILL FORGING AHEAD IN THAT WAY BECAUSE WE ARE WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT BUT WE'D REALLY LIKE TO CLOSE THE GAP IN REGARDS TO YOU OF THAT INFORMATION NOT BEING PROVIDED- AND SO THINKING THROUGH A NUMBER OF WAYS WHICH YOU CAN DO THAT BOTH THROUGH. IMPROVING THE COLLECTION AND UPDATING OF CONTACTED GEOGRAPHIC DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION BUT ALSO WHAT WE CAN DO WITHIN THE MEDICAL APPLICATION ITSELF TO IMPROVE THE COLLECTION OF THAT THAT DATA- IN IT IS JUST- CRITIC ALL FOR EVERYTHING. THAT WE DO- AND SO I THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA- WE DO NEED TO ENGAGE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. THIS HAPPEN THIS IS NOT ANY EASY FEAT- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION. IN OUR IN OUR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS- SO I TO ENSURE THAT RELEVANT ENTITIES INCLUDING PLANS AND PROVIDERS- CAN MORE EASILY SHARED OBTAIN UP TO DATE BENEFITS YOUR INFORMATION. WE DO INTEND TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP OF- STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING THAT THAT INFORMATION IS UPDATED OR AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE BOTH BUT AT THE UP FRONT A COLLECTION OF THAT AND THEN OF COURSE- AS WE CAN UPDATE IT WITHIN AND ACROSS OUR ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SYSTEMS. THE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN ASKED WHETHER. THERE WERE ANY LEGAL BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING THIS EFFORT- THERE ARE NO LEGAL BARRIERS- THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE TODAY FOR EXAMPLE- IN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- WHERE THEY CAN CONTACT THE COUNTY OFFICES BY PHONE FAX OR EMAIL. TO PROVIDE UPDATED BENEFICIARY CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF AND ADDRESS CHANGES NAME CHANGES AND TELEPHONE NUMBER CHANGES. MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE COUNTY PER STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. I'M EVEN IF THE BENEFICIARY HAS NOT- PROVIDED CONSENT TO DO SO- AS A PART OF THAT PROCESS THOUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS INFORM THE COUNTY WHETHER THE BENEFICIARY HAS APPROVED THE SHARING OF THAT UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION. AND WHEN APPROVED- AND WHEN APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED. OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN INDICATES THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE BENEFICIARIES CAN SENSE- INFORMATION AND THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT. COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKER TO REACH OUT TO THE BENEFICIARY VERIFY THAT NEW INFORMATION ON BEFORE MAKING THE CHANGES IN THE CASE RECORD. AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT PROCESS IS PROBABLY NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT IN REGARDS TO ENSURING. THAT WE GET UPDATED IT CONTACT ENDEAVOR. AND MOST CAL HAVE ESTABLISH A METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING THE UPDATED BENEFICIARY. INFORMATION WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS OPERATING IN THEIR COUNTY- HOWEVER WE DO FEEL LIKE THERE COULD BE- SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN REGARDS TO THIS PROCESS- MOVING FORWARD- THERE WAS ALSO A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS EFFORT- THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM ARE- SAWS- IT IS THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT COUNTIES USED TO UPDATE AND STORE BENEFICIARY CONTACT AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. WHEN COUNTY'S INPUT INFORMATION UPDATES INTO SAWS THE CHANGES ARE TRANSMITTED TO DH CS IS A MEDIC CAL ELIGIBILITY DATA SYSTEM OR WHAT'S KNOWN AS MEDS- AND THESE CHANGES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY SHARED THROUGH DATA TRANSACTIONS- FOR MEDS TO HEALTH PLANS AND THEN ULTIMATELY. YOU OTHER DELEGATED ENTITIES AND PROVIDERS SO AS YOU CAN SEE REALLY CRITICAL THAT THE INFORMATION IS UPDATED I'M IN THE INITIAL ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS WHEN WE KICKED OFF THE PROPOSAL. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWO. THE DISCUSSIONS AT LEAST THAT WE IT WOULD BE NO THE PROPOSAL'S THREE RELEASED BEFORE THAT. IT INCLUDED A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION CONSUMER HEALTH ADVOCATES PLANS- EXCEPT IRAQ- YOU OUTLINE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PROCESS SEE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY. MANUAL COUNTY WORKLOAD ON BOTH ON BEHALF OF THE PLAN AND THE COUNTY TO HAVE TO LOOK AT- UPDATES ARE OFTEN ENTERED MANUALLY BY THE COUNTY POTENTIALLY EVEN ONE BY ONE THAT'S A HUGE LIFT- VOLUME OF CHANGES- AND SOMETIMES DUPLICATIVE CHANGES- SO SOME MANAGED CARE PLAN STATED THAT THEY SPEND APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND BENEFICIARY UPDATES. ON IT A WEEKLY- ON A WEAK ON THAT THE NOT THAT'S ON AVERAGE. IMAGINE BEING ON THE COUNTY SIDE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THAT LEVEL OF UPDATES ON IT BUT IT ALSO SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO GET UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION FORCING THAT LEVEL OF CHANGE. WE DO KNOW THAT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CAN BE SOMEWHAT TRAINS YET AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET A HOLD OF THEM GET THEM INFORMATION GET THEM NOTICES FOR EXAMPLE OF FOR SENDING A NOTICE OF ACTION. MANY GOOD ADDRESS SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO APPEAL THOSE BENEFITS IF FOR SOME REASON SOMETHING WAS DENIED OR MODIFIED THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR US TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING INFORMATION TO OUR BENEFICIARIES- SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY LOOKING TO EXPLORE ELECTRONIC OR AUTOMATED TRANSMISSIONS OF THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS LIKE I MENTIONED COLLECTING IN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION UP FRONT. EVEN BETTER FROM OUR OUR APPLICATION PROCESS WHICH CAN BE A CHALLENGE WE KNOW THAT'S A HUGE LIFT BUT WE DO THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL FOR US TO DO BEFORE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE- EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO GET DATA FOR EQUITY CLOSURE. AS WELL AS CONTACT THEIR BENEFICIARIES TO ENSURE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHT TO SERVICES AND MEDICARE AND BE INFORMED IN REGARDS TO THE BENEFIT THAT WE PROVIDE. THIS CONCLUDES THAT MY AT COMMENTED THIS TIME AND- TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WILL FROM NED REST WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU DISTURB BRIEFLY- WE FEEL THAT THIS PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE AND CONCEPT. THAT IMPROVING THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO CONTACT- INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM MEDICAL SERVICES- CLEARLY IMPROVES THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- ASSEMBLY WHOLE PERSON CARE ADMINISTRATORS HAVE NOTED THAT. AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE FOR THEM WAS JUST THE ABILITY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH BENEFICIARIES SO- THIS IS CLEARLY BEEN AN ISSUE FOR SOME TIME AND- WE FEEL THAT AGAIN THAT- THE PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE IN CONCEPT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAX WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD WITH CWD. OR I CAN REMEMBER A TIME YEAH OKAY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MEMBERS KATHY THUNDERWING MCDONALD WITH THE COUNTY WALKER DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSED WORKGROUP WE DO THINK AS THE SKIPPER NOTED THAT THIS IS MORE COMPLEX THAN I THINK. MAYBE ARE REALIZED ON FIRST BLUSH GIVEN THAT KEEPING PEOPLE'S ADDRESSES UP TO DATE. SOUNDS LIKE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE PASSED. BUT IT ACTUALLY NOT AS AS YOU MIGHT THINK I THINK- AGAIN THE SKIPPER GOT A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING THE STEPS THAT COUNTIES HAVE TO FOLLOW. THE MAIN. GOAL THOUGH IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE VERIFYING WITH AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY HAVE INDEED CHANGED THEIR ADDRESS OR OTHER CONTACT INFORMATION. BEFORE WE ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE THAT CHANGE IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT NOT ONLY THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT IT'S ALSO THE SYSTEM OF RECORD. FOR MEDICCAL IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT- INFORMATION WE MAY LOSE CONTACT WITH THEM AND SO WE CAN'T JUST TAKE THE WORD OF SOMEONE IN A HEALTH PLAN OR SOME OTHER STORES. INTEL WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH THEM. THE OTHER REASON WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND SOMEONE MOVES. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO REPORT THAT TO US WITHIN TEN DAS IF WE FIND OUT EITHER DIRECTLY FROM THEM OR THROUGH ANOTHER SOURCE SUCH AS THE HEALTH PLAN REPORT. THAT APPEARANCE THEIR ADDRESSES CHANGED THE COUNTY HAS TO READ THE TERMINOLOGY ABILITY BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TERM AND- YES THEY WERE MADE ELIGIBLE OR NOT. AND SO TAKING SOMEONE ELSES WORD FOR AN ADDRESS CHANGE. ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A SET OF- SORT OF SET UP FOR OUR PROCEDURES THAT TAKE PLACE. THAT COULD ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A PERSON BE BEING MADE INELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. AND SO I THINK IT'S ONE REASON TO TREAD CAREFULLY INTO THIS AREA. TO ENSURE THAT WERE BOTH ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY DOING THAT BUT ALSO THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING NEGATIVE ACTIONS THAT COULD. AFFECT THE- AND INDIVIDUAL OUR FAMILIES ELIGIBILITY- WITHOUT. BEING VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. OR HEAD OF SITUATION THAT HAPPEN WITHIN THE- AND WE DON'T THAT AFTER- YOU KNOW DISCONTINUE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE UNLESS WE ABSOLUTELY. TO BECAUSE OF AN ELIGIBILITY. SO WITH THAT- WE THINK THAT THE WORKGROUP CAN HELP TO SORT OUT THOSE. KIND OF THORNY ISSUES AND IDEALLY PUT IN PLACE SOME PROCESS FEES. AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT ARE ENGAGED AND WHEN SOMETHING WOULD BE REPORTED. HOW IT WOULD BE REPORTED AND HOW THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT ACTED UPON OR- DISPOSITION. THANKS FUNNY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KERRY SANDERS WITH THE CALIORNIA. PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. J. AND HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME- COUPLE THOUGHT DEPEND STRONGLY SUPPORT AND THANKS THE H. YEAH- FOR THE CRITICAL PROPOSAL TO- AND SHE CAN BE IN A WORKER TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON WAYS TO. AND WHICH BENEFICIARY CONTACT AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION CAN BE UPDATED BY OTHER ENTITIES- CAN USE OF COLOR THE MAJORITY EVEN REALLY THE MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION. AND HAVE POOR OUTCOMES ON KEY HEALTH INDICATORS INCLUDING ASTHMA DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH. YOU'RE JUST HEALTH DISPARITIES MEDIKAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND THE STATE MUST EXPLICITLY DOCUMENT AND MEASURE THE EXISTENCE OF DISPARITIES AND TARGET RESOURCES TOWARDS ELIMINATING THEM. AIMED AT THE FINAL RULE REQUIRES THE STATE TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE AND REDUCE DISPARITIES BASED ON AGE RACE ETHNICITY. FACTS PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND DISABILITY STATUS. AND UNDER THE FINAL RULE CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FOR EACH MEDICAID ENROLLEE. AND PROVIDE IT TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT. IN TURN DHS REQUIRES MANAGED CARE PLAN TO PROVIDE A DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BENEFICIARIES. INCLUDING FOR MEASURES AND THERE I HOPE DISPARITIES ANALYSIS. I'M WALDRON LP- I HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO US AND WE- ARE AT THAT TIME. THAT THERE'S STILL A WIDE VARIATION IN DATA QUALITY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS. WHICH SERIOUSLY LIMITS THE GENERAL GENERAL GENERALIZE ABILITY OF THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS. AND YOU KNOW WHERE AND YOU KNOW A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE IS. STILL THE NORM FOR THE PLAN TO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MEMBERSHIP IT DOESN'T YIELD THE STATE YOU KNOW NEAR THE LEVEL OF DATA THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY DISPARITIES. AND TARGET THE NECESSARY. INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS. WIDESPREAD ADOPTION PATIENT HEALTH RECORD. ALLOWS US THE CREDIT AFTER IN TOWARD MARKET DATA. WERE FOR ALL MET THAN. ALLOWING DHS TO IMPROVE. YOU THE UPDATED CONTACT AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WILL ALLOW FOR MORE GRANULAR DISAGGREGATION OF THE STATE AS- A DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. AND THE ABILITY OF THE EXTENT OF THAT YOUR FOR YOUR TARGET TO IMPROVE OU HEALTH DISPARITIES WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY GOAL OF AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE CENTER BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. AND ADDITIONALLY ADDITION WORK TO IMPLEMENT CAL IN ACCURATE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION REPORTING WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PAGE AND- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS RESULT IN PROPER CARE MANAGEMENT ALL RESPECT MEN. AND MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES OF PLANS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SCREEN THEIR MEMBERS THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS INCLUDING SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL RISK AS WELL AS THE UNBIASED RESTAURANT THE KITCHEN AND SEGMENTATION. I'M OF THE MENTION OF MY PREVIOUS. THE POPULATION OF MANSIONS REQUIRED TO MANAGE IN THE FAST. PACED AT RISK IN ORDER TO TARGET A CORPORATE INTERVENTION. AND WHILE PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS HOLD MAY HOLD PROMISE. I'M MANY PH AN ALGORITHM- FIRST TESTING RISK ARE BIASED WHEN AND FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON HEALTHCARE COST AND UTILIZATION- WHEN THERE ARE OTHER DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE. THE PAGE AND TRY TO DO WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR DIVERSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND IF THEY ARE ABLE TO INCLUDE AN- ACCURATE MORE ACCURATE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AS WELL DATA ON SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH- WE SUPPORTED EXTENSIVE GOALS AND ESTABLISHING THIS WORKGROUP. I AND THE POINT THAT KATHY SANDERLING REYES ABOUT THE NUANCES THE STATE NEEDS TO CONSIDER AND- YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT WAY TO EXCHANGE THE DATA AYE WE RECOMMEND THE DHS CONTINUE THE WORK GROUP AND- INCLUDE AND CONTINUE TO INCLUDE CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS. IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. ADDITIONALLY A PART OF THESE EFFORTS WE OFFER THREE- RECOMMENDATION- SPECIFIC YOU KNOW WHETHER NOW OR IN FUTURE SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE DHS THAT CONCRETE TARGETS FOR THE COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF ACCURATE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FOR ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- AND FOR FUN TO BE TIED TO SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS REQUIREMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND COVER CALIFORNIA HEARING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO COVER CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE ALL OF ITS HEALTH PLAN TO ACHIEVE EIGHTY PERCENT. SELF IDENTIFICATION OF RACE ETHNICITY. DATA FOR THEIR ENROLLEES. I AND- ADDITIONALLY COME CALIFORNIA TIME SEVEN POINT 5% AT RISK. TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GOAL. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN ACROSS THE BOARD- SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN INVESTMENT- AND WE KNOW THAT THE STATE AS- PRIORITIZING THAT AND I THINK. YOU KNOW IS- AND BEGINNING TO INVEST IN THE AND THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDED THAT TO FACILITATE- ADDITIONAL GRANULARITY AND THE COLLECTION REPORTING AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. INCLUDING THROUGH MUCH NEEDED UPDATES TO THE METRIC SYSTEM AND WE THINK THE STATE FOR FOCUSING ON THAT. LASTLY WE ENCOURAGED EACH YES HEALTH PLANS HEALTH SYSTEMS AND PROVIDERS TO ADOPT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OMG STANDARDS FOR THE COLLECTION REPORTING A DEMOGRAPHIC DATA- BE STANDARDS INCLUDE DATA ON BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL RISK FACTORS WHICH WILL FIFTY EIGHT YEAH. BOTH IN SETTING YOUR OF YOUR TARGETS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND DISPARITIES PRODUCTION- AND ALSO ALLOWING FOR GREATER OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. UNDER THE NEW POPULATION. I WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE I WILL BEGIN- FIRST I WANT TO THANK SEE PAM FOR THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE AND- WORKING TOWARDS GRANULAR LEAVE DIS AGGREGATING THAT DATA. SO WE CAN START WORKING TOWARDS HEALTH EQUITY BUT WANTED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF I COULD- THE WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO COLLECT IN TERMS OF DATA THAT YOU'RE NOT COLLECTING NOW. AND WILL THIS DATA BE AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. I THINK WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT OUR MEDICARE APPLICATION IN REGARDS TO A FEW THINGS- AND IT CAN BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED WITH A MEDIC CAL APPLICATION BECAUSE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE GATHER. THE INFORMATION THAT THAT WE GET OR ON THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS AND THEN GOES HAVE PROVIDERS AND PLANS ETCETERA- BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY STMS RULES THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IN REGARDS TO WHERE WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING MANDATORY VERSUS OPTIONAL. I'M ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS. WHERE A CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IS EVEN BEING REQUESTED ON THE APPLICATION- AS DIRECTOR LIFE BORN WITH POINT OUT TO YOU OUR TEAM- I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO ON PAGE TWENTY SIX OF THE WHOLE APPLICATION IN REGARDS TO WHERE WE'RE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS AND ANYONE. WHO'S FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION OF THAT LENGTH IS GOING TO BE QUITE TIRED BY THAT TIME AS HE OFTEN POINTS OUT TO US AND SO EVEN STEPPING BACK AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE- WE'RE ASKING CERTAIN QUESTIONS. ON THE APPLICATION OF THOSE ARE HARDER CHANGES TO MAKE AS WE ALL KNOW BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM IMPACTS AND VARIOUS PIECES THAT WILL REQUIRE CMS APPROVAL BUT I THINK WHAT- I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING ACROSS THE BOARD IN REGARDS TO HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS. NOT JUST HOW WE GET THE UPDATED INFORMATION FOR BENEFICIARIES IF THEY DON'T PROVIDED UPON APPLICATION- ORBIT CHANGES- IN HER SAID CONTACT INFORMATION ABOUT REALLY HOW WE CAN. ALSO LOOK AT OUR MEDIC CALIFORNIA EACH AND IN WAYS THAT OR STREAMLINED APPLICATION OF WAYS OF REALLY GETTING BETTER INFORMATION- FROM THE BEGINNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I WOULD. NOW TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE ENTIRE PANEL SEVEN AS WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT. AND WILL NOW PASS IT OVER TO DR WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR ARAMBULA- THIS IS THE- NEW- THE PANEL ON- NEW DEBIT CAL BENEFITS- AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE SO WITNESSES IN THIS PANEL WILL BE. A J. C. COOPER A FAMILIAR FACE TO US ALL NOW- BEN JOHNSON FROM THE LA ALWAYS L. A. O.'S OFFICE DARIA MCGREW SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. AND KATIE ANDREWS SENIOR SENIOR HEALTH POLICY NOT REACH ASSOCIATE WITH CHILDREN NOW. SO WE'LL START WITH YOU I MISS COOPER. THANK YOU WE DID TRY TO BRING COLLEAGUES WITH US TODAY WILL AND I TO. IT UP A LITTLE BIT TODAY- BUT YES THANK YOU I'M SO REALLY WITH THIS CALLIN PROPOSAL WERE REALLY WANTED TO BUILD ON MANY OF THE SUCCESSES THAT WE SAW WITHIN THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE OR WHAT'S KNOWN AS IDTI. DCS IS VERY COMMITTED- TO IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY OF MEDICAL DENTAL SERVICES AN ORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WELL WE'VE COME. A LONG WAY WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'M IN THE TO MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CALENDAR PUZZLES WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS THAT WE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE DTI PILOTS. I'M IMPLIED THEN ACCORDINGLY TO CHILDREN ADULTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WITHOUT THE CALLIE PROPOSAL THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE I WOULD HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE OR WILL BE SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALSO REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TRANSITIONING THOSE THOSE PIECES FORWARD. SO THERE ARE. FOUR MAIN PROPOSALS WITHIN CAL AIM ON THE DENTAL FRONT- ESSENTIALLY WE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTING A STATE PLAN TO ADD IT CARRIES RISK ASSESSMENT BUNDLE FOR CHILDREN- THIS WOULD AND COULD BE BILLED. TWO TO FOUR TIMES PER YEAR DEPENDING ON THE RISK LEVEL IT ALSO INCLUDES LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH RISK OF VISIT FREQUENCIES AS WELL AS- NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING. IN THAT BUNDLE AS WELL. ARE ALSO PROPOSING A SILVER DIAMINE FLUORIDE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND SPECIFIED HIGH RISK IN INSTITUTIONAL POPULATIONS OF THIS BENEFIT PROVIDES TWO VISITS PER MEMBER PER YEAR UP FOR UP TO TEN TEETH. AND A MAXIMUM OF FOUR TREATMENTS PER TOOTH- AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO AREAS A TO EMPLOYMENT FOR PAPER PERFORMANCE I'M IN THIS SPACE THE FIRST ONE REPORTING INCREASED USE OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES. REALLY SEEN GREAT STRIDES IN REGARDS TO THE GT I WORKED THERE. AND THE SECOND ONE BOARDING. ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING CON NEW CHARACTER DENTAL. WITH THE RATE AB. TO PROVIDER. ON THAT- PROVIDE CONNIE OF CARE FOR ANNUAL RE- AND DENTAL EXAMINATIONS FOR TWO OR MORE YEARS IN A ROW. I'M REALLY BASED ON DATAFROM THE DTI EVALUATION- THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE OVERALL DENTAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN ARE BY INCREASING THE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES UTILIZE- UP FOR BOTH TREATMENT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD CARIES AND IN ESTABLISHING DENTAL HOMES. I'M WITH TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF CONTINUITY OF CARE. AND THE PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES UTILIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN AGES ONE THROUGH TWENTY INCREASED BY A TEN POINT 58% FROM BASELINE- TO PROGRAM YOUR FOR SO I'M INCREASES THERE STILL OF KNOWLEDGE IN WE WANT TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS BECOME EVEN HIGHER- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH PROPOSING A STATEWIDE. ED BENEFITS THROUGH THROUGH CALLING. ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVICE AND DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS RENDERING PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES- TO AT LEAST TEN CHILDREN AGES ONE THROUGH TWENTY INCREASED BY 8% FROM BASELINE. AS WELL AND THERE WAS A 109% INCREASE IN PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO SIX WHO RECEIVED KERR'S RISK ASSESSMENTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. SO REALLY LOOKING FOR- THOSE ADMISSION IS TO MOVE FORWARD AND TAKE CONTINUE. SEEING GROWTH IN THOSE. THEN LASTLY UP FROM BAY. HERE TO YOUR FOR BOTH OF THOSE. INITIAL CAL. AND THE SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION COUNTIES THERE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT INCREASES IN CON AIR CARE FOR CHILDREN AGES TWENTY AND UNDER OF THAT WERE OVER THE RESPECTIVE YEARS OF THAT PROGRAM. SO REALLY I DH CS HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A GOAL- FOR ADULT UTILIZATION- BUT THIS IS UNDER CONSIDERATION- HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THERE IS NOT A NATIONAL BENCHMARK HERE. FOR US TO REALLY UTILIZE UNDER US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HEALTHY PEOPLE INITIATIVES OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY ON THERE ARE ESTABLISHED ORAL HEALTH GOALS ON EVERY TEN YEARS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH THE GOALS FOCUSED ON CERTAIN AGE GROUPS. WITH CERTAIN HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS DIABETES AND SMOKING THE QUE- USE OF EMERGENCY ROOM EXCEPT. UNDER MEDICARE THE CURRENT AVERAGE ANNUAL DENTAL VISIT UTILIZATION FOR INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE IS ONLY 22% SO WE DO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION AND UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO HAVE A GOAL FOR DOLE UTILIZATION. THERE ARE STILL CONDUCTING THAT RESEARCH AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. ADDITIONALLY OF AN INITIAL STEP DH CS- HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN WILL ENGAGE IN THE FUTURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND THE STATE DENTAL DIRECTOR TO LEVERAGE THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA ORAL HEALTH PLAN. TO INFORM WHAT THAT ADULT DENTAL UTILIZATION GOAL COULD BE- AND THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS HAPPY OUT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WILL HAVE- BEEN JOHNSON. WITH THE L. A. L. THANK. I COULD AFTER I'M JUST A BRIEF OF CALM HERE- JUST NOTE THAT- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE ANY SORT OF CONCERNS THAT- ALL WITH. REGARD TO THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON- THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE AS DIRECTOR COOPER- I NOTED- IT IS WE JUST NOTED IS ONE OF THE- MORE PROMINENT SORT OF FUNDING ITEMS WITHIN THAT CALTRAIN PROPOSAL- COMING IT AT FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ABOUT TWICE THAT TOTAL FUNDS. FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION DOWN A LITTLE BIT OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THEREAFTER USING USING GENERAL FUND AND YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WE FIND- THE PROPOSAL TO USE GENERAL FUND REASONABLE PREVIOUSLY OF DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE HAD USED A STRONGER DISTINCT STATE FARM SOURCE THAT REALLY IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE SO JUST WANTED TO. COMMENT THAT THAT WE DO THINK USING GENERAL FUND HERE AND PLACE OF THE PRIOR FUND SOURCE. DOES PROBABLY MAKE SENSE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY- MOVING ON TO DARIA MY GROUP. WITH THE CAL DENTAL. RIGHT HI- THANK YOU TEARS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. IT IS STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES CONTAINED WITHIN THE COWLING PROPOSAL AND THE FOCUS ON DELIVERING INTEGRATED COORDINATED SERVICES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE ARE ENORMOUSLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE SUCCESSFUL COMPONENTS. OF THE DTI INTO THE GENERAL DENTAL PROGRAM. AS DENNIS OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT ORAL HEALTH IS INTEGRAL TO PHYSICAL AND GENERALLY THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL THE FOCUS ON COMPLEX I NEED POPULATIONS COULD BENEFIT. FROM CLOSER PARTNERSHIP AND COORDINATION WITH DENTAL PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THESE PATIENTS ARE SUPPORTED AND THEIR ORAL HEALTH NEEDS SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED. LOOKING BACK SIX YEARS PRIOR TO THE DTI DENTAL PROGRAM WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE. THERE WERE SEVERAL CRITICAL AUDITS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. PEDIATRIC UTILIZATION WAS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY. THE ADULT DENTAL BENEFIT ELIMINATED IN THE GREAT RECESSION WAS ONLY PARTIALLY RESTORED AND 10% PROVIDER RATE REDUCTIONS WERE STILL IN EFFECT. PROVIDER PARTICIPATION WAS DISMALLY LOW AND THERE WERE SIX THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DISSATISFACTION WITH BOTH THE RATES AND IT MINISTRY TO PROCESS ITS- FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE DENTAL PROGRAM HAS SEEN STEADY IMPROVEMENT A DEFINITE MOVEMENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD THE DTI PROVIDED A CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING THE FIRST RATE INCREASES OVER A DECADE AND KICKED OFF A SERIES OF POSITIVE CHANGES. THE STATE WAS ABLE TO REVERSE THE 10% PROVIDER RATE REDUCTION- THERE WERE. CHANGES IN THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPROVE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS SUCH AS PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS PROVIDER APPLICATIONS AND PATIENT OUTREACH. THE PASSAGE OF PROBLEMS PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX. ADDED SIGNIFICANT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE GENERATES. FIFTY SIX FUNDS ALSO CREATED A BRAND NEW STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR NEARLY GRADUATING DENTISTS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BUILD A CAREER THAT INCLUDES MEDICAL PATIENTS. IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS ALREADY EIGHTY DENTISTS HAVE RECEIVED AWARDS IN EXCHANGE FOR A FIVE YEAR SERVICE COMMITMENT TO MEDICAL AND MANY MORE THAN THAT HAVE APPLIED IN THE HOPES OF RECEIVING SUCH AWARDS. ALL OF THESE INTERVENTIONS HAVE COLLECTIVELY CHANGE THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM AND IMPROVE THE ORAL HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS AFTER TEN YEARS OF DECLINING PARTICIPATION NEARLY TWO THOUSAND DENTISTS HAVE NEWLY ENROLLED AND THAT'S A 20% INCREASE FROM WHERE WE WERE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. THE BACKGROUND PAPER ALSO HIGHLIGHTS AND DIRECTOR COOPER HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE- WANT TO TAKE OF SUCCESSES SEEN IN THE DTI PILOTS SO I WON'T GO ANY FURTHER INTO THOSE NUMBERS. ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PILOT PROGRAMS TESTED IN THE DTI WERE THE FIRST TIME THAT OUR DENTAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE INCENTIVES OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN GOING IN THAT DIRECTION FOR SEVERAL YEAR SEVERAL YEARS BUT DENTISTRY IS JUST STARTING ALONG THAT PATH AND THIS WAS A VERY INNOVATIVE PART OF THE DTI AND WILL BE ROLLED INTO THE ACCOUNTING PROPOSAL. THE DTI HAS RENEWED THE PROGRAM'S FOCUS ON EARLY PREVENTIVE TREATMENT ESPECIALLY FOR A BURNISHED SILVER DIçN IN FLORIDA AND OTHER LOW COST INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR MORE EXPENSIVE RESTORATIVE TREATMENT IN THE FUTURE. HOLDING THESE BENEFITS INTO THE GENERAL DENTAL PROGRAM WILL EXPAND ON INITIAL SUCCESS BILL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES INTO THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVE PREVENTIVE CARE. WE ARE HOWEVER CONCERNED THAT RECENT ACTION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MENTIONED BY THE L. L. A. O. WILL CREATE A LAPSE IN FUNDING AS THE STATE TRANSITIONS TO THE NEW BENEFIT STRUCTURE UNDER CALLING HIM AND THAT COULD DESTABILIZE THE PROGRESS SO FAR. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS THAT GAP. LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE FULL. PROPOSED THE PROPOSED FULL INTEGRATION PILOT. WHILE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TESTING MODELS FOR MEDICAL DENTAL INTEGRATION WE WOULD STRONGLY OPPOSE ALLOWING ANY FUTURE PLANNED. TO SIMPLY SUBCONTRACTED WILL BENEFIT OUT TO A SPECIALIZED PLAN. WE ASK THAT THE THAT THE FULL EXPANSION OF FULLY INTEGRATED PLANS NOW TARGETED FOR JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LESSONS. AND EXPERIENCE FROM THE FORTHCOMING HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO PILOT. CA HAS BEEN WORKING IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HEALTH MINISTER MATTEO TO CREATE A TRULY INTEGRATED DENTAL BENEFITS WITHIN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THAT IS SET TO BEGIN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AS THE STATE MOVES FORWARD IN ITS CAL AND IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL MOVE ON TO KßT ANDREW A SENIOR. HEALTH POLICY NOT REACH ASSOCIATE. ASSOCIATE WITH CHILDREN NOW. THANK YOU TO CHERISH DR WHETHER DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE AND I AM A SENIOR HEALTH POLICY ASSOCIATE- AND OUT REACHES AS THE EXCUSE ME CHILDREN NOW- CHILDREN NOW IS A NONPARTISAN WHOLE CHILD RESEARCH POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH EDUCATION AND WELL BEING IN CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES JOINTLY HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS BOTH COMMITTEES AND SPEAK TO THE DENTAL COMPONENT OF THE CALLIN PROPOSAL WITH THE CHILD FOCUS LANDS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK AND EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES STAFF IN DEVELOPING THE AMBITIOUS CALIPERS TOOL. I WILL START WITH A HIGH LEVEL COMMENTED ON THE KALYAN PROPOSAL AND WHILE IT OUTLINES AN INNOVATIVE RESTRUCTURING OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. IT FAILS TO CLEARLY CENTER CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND DOES NOT ARTICULATE HOW THE STATE WILL ENSURE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PLANTS AND CONTRACTORS. FOR THE DENTAL PORTION OF THE CALLIN PROPOSAL I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ECHO CTAS COMMENTS CHILDREN I WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ABSENT BENEFITS AND POVIDER PAYMENTS ALLOWED FOR UNDER THE DTI ONE YEAR EXTENSION. PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALLIN DENTAL PROPOSAL IN JANUARY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND DUE TO CMS'S SUNSETTING OF THE SPENDING AUTHORITY THROUGH THE STATE'S DESIGNATED STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT EXPLORE DRESSING THIS GAP IN FUNDING VIA THE MAY REVISE PROCESS AND BY BEGINNING THE CALLIN DENTAL PROPOSAL PRIOR TO THE PROPOSED DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO AVOID DISRUPTION IN BENEFITS AND PROVIDER PAYMENTS. SECOND WE HAVE SOME CONCERN AROUND MAINTAINING THE INVESTMENTS IN KIDS ORAL HEALTH THAT WERE SEEN THROUGH DTI WHILE EXPANDING THESE BENEFITS THE ADULT POPULATION WELL WE ARE SUPPORTED WITH THE EXPANSION TO ADULTS. WE WOULD CAUTION THE DEPARTMENT IN DOING SO IF IT IS AT ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF GAINS MADE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH CARE AND- THE ORAL HEALTH STATUS OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF CARE COORDINATION WHILE IT IS GUARANTEED THROUGH EPS DTA THE STATUS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ENSURE THAT PLANS ARE COORDINATING CHILDREN'S PREVENTATIVE DENTAL CARE AND AIDING IN ESTABLISHING A DENTAL HOME. WE BELIEVE THAT CARE COORDINATION IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE ALTHOUGH AT THE LOCAL DENTAL PILOT PROJECTS FUNDED THROUGH DOMAIN FOR THE DTI DID NOT CONTINUE. UNDER THE ONE YEAR EXTENSION THERE'S PLENTY TO BE GLEANED FROM THE CARE COORDINATION STRATEGIES TESTED THROUGH THESE PILOTS. IN A BRIEF THAT CHILDREN ARE PRODUCED IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE LOOKED AT THE CARE COORDINATION EFFORTS ACROSS THE LOCAL DENTAL PILOT PROJECTS AND WHAT SURFACED FROM THAT ANALYSIS. IS THAT ROBUST COMMUNITY BASED CARE COORDINATION DONE BY COMMUNITY ROOTED AND TRUSTED SOURCES WAS NOT ONLY EFFECTIVE IN CONNECTING CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES TO DENTAL CARE. BUT ALSO IMPROVED IN IMPROVING PROVIDER SATISFACTION WITH THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE KELLY PROPOSAL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO COURSE CORRECT IN ESTABLISH THESE ROBUST COMMUNITY BASED COORDINATION NETWORKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM STATES THAT IT WILL COORDINATE CARE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF MEDIC MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENTAL ORAL HEALTH. AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS INCLUDING TRACKING REFERRALS AND OUTCOMES OF REFERRALS WELL WE APPLIED THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO ENSURE CARE IS COORDINATED ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHAT THE MECHANISM IS FOR COORDINATING CARE PARTICULARLY ORAL HEALTH CARE ACROSS THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THAT CARE. AND HOW IT WILL E TRACKED AND MEASURED. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT ENSURE THAT CONTRACTS RESULTING FROM THE MANAGED CARE AND DENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATION PROCUREMENT PROCESS THESE INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PLANS AND DENTAL SO TO USE A COMMON SYSTEM TO TRACK REFERRALS THE OUTCOME OF THOSE REFERRALS AND RELATED CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE AND DENTAL SO CONTRACTS REQUIRE PERIODIC REPORTING OF METRICS SPECIFIC TO REFERRALS REFERRAL TRACKING AND REFERRAL OUTCOMES FOR SERVICES REQUIRED UNDER THE E. P. S. D. T. MANDATE. LASTLY THE CALIBER POSTAL ADDS NEW LEVELS OF AND CRITERIA FOR CARE COORDINATION BUT LACKS SPECIFICITY ABOUT HOW CHILDREN WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO MONITORED IN AND SERVED BY THE NEW ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WE RECOMMEND THAT IS PART OF THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT PROPOSAL. THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRE MANAGED CARE PLANS IDENTIFY CHILDREN FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT WHO ARE DEEMED HIGH RISK VIA IT CARRIES RISK ASSESSMENT EMBEDDED WITH IN AND NATIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS REQUIRED OF PLANS. AGAIN THANK YOU TO BOTH COMMITTEES FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS AFTER AMBULANCE OKAY I HAVE A I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AND THAT. ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THAT'S- I RECOGNIZE THAT- WE DON'T WE DON'T YOU YOU SAID- MISS COOPER THAT WE'RE NOT SETTING A GOAL FOR ADULT YOU TO THE UTILIZATION OF DATA CAO. BUT DO WE HAVE DATA ON CURRENTLY ON UTILIZATION DATA CAL VERSUS WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER STATES- AND IF WE DO- WOULD THAT NOT BE IMPORTANT TO USE THAT AS A GUIDING- AS GUIDING DATA TO- MAKING IMPROVEMENTS SELF. SO I DON'T KNOW OFF HAND WHETHER WE HAVE DONE THE COMPARISON OF THE UTILIZATION CALIFORNIA DIRECTLY TO OTHER STATES I WOULD IMAGINE THE TEAM HAS LOOKED AT THAT BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT BACK AS WORK I'M LOOKING AT WHAT GOAL WE COULD SET IN THE ADULT POPULATION LET ME JUST PAUSE AND SEE WHERE NAY- MAILLOUX WHO ARE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFITS AND OVERSEES OUR DENTAL- SHE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO- INFORMATION HAPPEN OTHER STATES. YES HI OF RENE MALL- THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT ADULT DENTAL SERVICES WE DON'T HAVE MUCH. I'M IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE IT IS AN OPTIONAL BENEFIT. I'M AND NOT MANY STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO COVER AND DENTAL SERVICES. SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE TO US BUT WE CAN GO BACK TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME- INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP TO INFORM ADULT DENTAL UTILIZATION. OKAY WELL THANK YOU. I GUESS I GUESS THE- THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT CAME UP ACTUALLY FROM I THINK IT WAS FROM OUR LAST WITNESS WAS. THE CONCERN ABOUT A LAPSE IN- IN IT OUT ONCE. IT ONCE WE MAKE THE TRANSITION THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LAPSE AND- AND YOU KNOW AS AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A PROVIDER. OF THE PROGRAM- ALTHOUGH IT'S ALBEIT IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A WHILE NOW- YOU KNOW ONCE YOU LOSE YOU THE PROVIDER NETWORK IS FRAGILE- BECAUSE- IT. IS ABOVE ALL HAS BEEN FRAGILE BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE UNPREDICTABILITY SO. ONCE YOU LOSE A PROVIDER- IT'S HARD TO GET HIM BACK SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO HELP WITH A LAP SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT. THAT PAYMENTS- DON'T THAT THAT THAT THERE ISN'T A DISRUPTION THAT POTENTIALLY. SETS US BACK ON OUR PROVIDER NETWORKS. FOR SO AS SOON AS THE ABOUT AS AT ALTERNATELY DENIED THE DISH BE WHICH WERE QUITE FUNNY DTI WE QUICK- ROUNDED INTERNALLY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS COULD BE IN REGARDS TO OF THE ROLL OVER FUNDS HOW LONG THAT COULD LAST AS AS WELL AS SYSTEM CHANGES TO QUICKLY PIVOT I'M SORT CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT NOW WE DO THINK IT ANTICIPATE THAT THE DISPUTE FUNDS THAT WE CAN USE THROUGH THE ROLL OVER AND WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED UPPER GI CAN GET US THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR- AND SO WE ARE A LOOKING AT THAT AND WOULD IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE AN UPDATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT REGARD SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING WITHIN THE MAYBE FIVE. OKAY THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND JUSTICE THANK YOU TO THIS ENTIRE PANEL FOR THE INFORMATION- MUCH APPRECIATED SUBJECT ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THAN THAT SOME OF THE OTHERS- BUT WE'RE ALL LEARNING WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THIS IS A DIVERSE GROUP OF HOSPITALS- TWO THIRDS ARE AND RURAL CALIFORNIA MORE THAN HALF OF A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL DESIGNATION WHICH MEANS THEY ARE THE SMALLEST AND MOST REMOTE. THE ADDITIONAL OUR DISTRICT HOSPITALS ARE MEDIUM TO LARGE SOME VERY LARGE AND ARE LOCATED IN SUBURBAN AND URBAN AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ALL PROVIDE AS ALL HOSPITALS DO NEEDED HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SERVICES BASED ON THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AS HAS BEEN NOTED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THESE HOSPITAL SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATED IN THE OUR PRIME PROGRAM AND ARE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE WORK BEGAN. OUT AS AN ALSO NOTED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS PROMOTING VALUE BASED. PURCHASING AND IMPROVING CARE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES BY TRANSITIONING TO THE Q. I. P. PROGRAM ORANGE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AS OUTLINED IN IN CALAIS. THE INCENTIVE FUNDING- TIED TO THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES OR METRICS AS THEIR A MENTION WILL ALLOW THE DISTRICT HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE GOLDEN AND PRIORITIES OF KALANK WHICH OBVIOUSLY IN TURN BENEFIT. THE COMMUNITIES AND THE PATIENTS SERVED. THE TYPES OF PRIDE THAT BEGUN IN FOR TO PRY WAS THE FIRST DELIVERY TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM FOR THE DISTRICT MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS US SO SOME EXAMPLES OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. WAS A BRINGING SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE EASTERN PLUMAS HEALTH CARE IN PORTOLA CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE ABLE TO PUT IN PLACE A BRAND NEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM IN COORDINATION WITH THEIR COUNTY. OF THAT MEANS THE PATIENTS NO LONGER HAVE TO DRIVE SIXTY MILES JR RECEIVE SERVICES ARE SIMILARLY LOMPOC VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER IN OUR WORLD SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WAS ABLE TO PARTNER AND BRING ONCOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICES. AGAIN ALLOWING PATIENTS TO RECEIVE SERVICES CLOSE TO HOME- OTHER HOSPITALS REPORT. AND YOU KNOW SAVING LIVES BASED ON CANCER SCREENINGS ARE SOUTHERN HUMBOLDT HEALTHCARE DISTRICT WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE WORK THAT THEY WERE DOING IN PRIME ON HEART DISEASE M. WHEN THE PANDEMIC STROKE WERE ABLE TO- BECAUSE THEY HAD IN PLACE A GOOD SYSTEM FOR COORDINATING CARE. AND COMMUNICATING WITH OUR PATIENTS THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THAT AND- WORK WITH THE WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE NEEDS. BEYOND HEALTHCARE NEEDS ARE GROCERY NEEDS ARE EXERCISE NEEDS AT CETERA. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. ALL DESTROY OUT IN UNISON HAAS SIXTY SICK.

AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- COVE IT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THESE HOSPITALS AND TEMPORARILY DEVOTED HAD DIVERTED. QUALITY EFFORTS BUT ALL ARE EAGER TO GET BACK ON J. Q. I. P. BASED ON A METRIC PLANNING AT DATA RESEARCH ETCETERA. THE ONE DOWNSIDE FOR DISTRICT HOSPITALS TRANSITIONING BETWEEN THESE TWO PROGRAMS IS A SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW DELAY OUR PRIME- WAS MORE IN A FEW FOR SERVICE CONSTRUCT Q. . P. AS NOTED AS PART OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE DIRECTED PAYMENTS AND- BECAUSE OF THIS THIS MEANS THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY FUNDING RECEIVED. IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO FOR THESE HOSPITALS FOR THIS PROGRAM AND IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE AND PRIME THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ALPHONSE. LIKE I SAID- BECAUSE OF KOBE CASH FLOW IS DEFINITELY AT A PREMIUM SO THIS IS DEFINITELY A CHALLENGE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF YOU TO MITIGATE. THAT CASH FLOW VIA SOME SHORT TERM LOANS ARE PROVIDED IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO- BEYOND THAT THOUGH LIKE I SAID PROGRAMMATIC LEE THESE HOSPITALS ARE VERY EAGER TO CONTINUE BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESSES.
