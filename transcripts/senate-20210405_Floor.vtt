MEASURE HAS THREE TWENTY FOUR

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:37.202
AND I WANT TO TAKE OUR

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.403
COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS FOR

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.438
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I ALSO

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:41.806
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SEND

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:42.874
MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:44.843
KELLY'S FAMILY. I HAD THE

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.445
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THEIR STORY

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:49.614
AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THE

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.650
PERCEPTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.585
WE OFTEN THINK THAT. IT IS THE

00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:56.121
MOST DANGEROUS TIME WHEN A

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:58.089
VICTIM IS IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:00.425
BUT KELLY STORY PROVES THAT IS

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:03.028
MORE DANGEROUS WHEN SOMEONE

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:05.664
GETS THE COURAGE TO LEAVE.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.299
THEIR ABUSER. KELLY HAD THE

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:10.168
COURAGE AND GOT OUT OF THAT

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.237
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER CHILDREN

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.572
HER THREE BOYS AND HE TRACTOR

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:18.710
DALAM. AND SHOT HER IN FRONT OF

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:21.546
HER THREE BOYS. AND THIS IS

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.448
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:25.283
OFTEN THINK OF PROTECTING THE

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.850
VICTIM WHEN THEY'RE IN THE

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.953
RELATIONSHIP AND THIS MEASURE

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.322
IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ALSO

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:31.456
NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:32.891
VICTIMS OUTSIDE THE

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:36.027
RELATIONSHIP. AND SO THIS IS

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.729
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:40.398
STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:43.668
DO WE VALIDATE THAT COURAGE. IT

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:47.439
TOOK TIME TO ANALYZE AND

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:50.008
FINALLY DECIDE TO LEAVE. BUT WE

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:52.110
ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO SAY

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.512
AFTER THEY LEAVE WHAT CAN WE DO

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:57.315
BETTER VICTIMS DESERVE BETTER

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:58.950
AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR
