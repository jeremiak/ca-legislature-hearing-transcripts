00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:32.463
CAN JUST HAVE SPANISH AND YOU'RE

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.831
DONE- ALTHOUGH I DO RECOGNIZE

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.066
THAT THERE'S VARIOUS DIALECTS IN

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.335
THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO IT'S- AS

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:39.103
WELL SO THAT- BUT I THINK FOR

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.104
THE PARTICULAR FOR THE API

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.239
COMMUTERS MANY DIFFERENT

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:42.840
LANGUAGES SO WE- WE NEED TO BE

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.843
SURE THAT. WHEN YOU KNOW

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:46.711
BUILDING LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.312
LANGUAGE CASSIDY IN THE STATE

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:49.680
ITSELF IS GOING TO BE REALLY

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.849
IMPORTANT AND- SO I THINK AS WE

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:54.185
LOOK AT- INVESTMENTS IN THAT

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.053
REGARD THAT DOES LINK UP TO IS

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.787
WE'RE BUILDING PASSING

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.656
COMMUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITIES

00:35:58.723 --> 00:35:59.891
AND REFER PEOPLE FOR STATE

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:01.826
SERVICES- AND WHETHER TO

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.794
COUNTIES ARE DIRECTLY THE STATE

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.196
WE NEED TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.632
CAPACITY- THE- TERMS OF. ONE

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:09.300
CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN REALLY

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:11.235
APPRECIATE OF- THE H. I. COCCUS

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.470
IN THIS PART OF THE LATINO

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:13.938
CAUCUS AND ADVOCATING FOR ONE

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.206
CALIFORNIA AGAIN I GUESS THERE'S

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:16.440
A CAPACITY ISSUE WHICH I

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.208
APPRECIATE THAT YOU TALKED

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:20.478
ABOUT- THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.646
TO SO IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING.

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.414
THAT YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND AND

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:24.782
SUPPORT OF- WHAT'S BEING

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.884
SUGGESTED IN TERMS OF BUILDING A

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.620
CASTING AND DOJ. BUT YOU KNOW IT

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.489
IS A SOMEONE LOOKING AT THE FACT

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.925
THAT- WE TRY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:38.129
IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS OUT.

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.230
THERE- AND THAT'S FOR THE REASON

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:39.897
YOU. YEAH ONLY SO MANY SOME YOU

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.666
CAN FIND OUT THERE BUT THEN

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:45.703
ALSO- THINKING ABOUT- ADDITION

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.738
TO. HOW DO YOU GROW THAT

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.974
PIPELINE- WHAT IS THE DEMAND

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.409
SELECTION MAYBE HIS SPEECH ALSO

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.077
WHAT'S OF THE MAN FROM ONE

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.579
CALIFORNIA SERVICES THAT THIS

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:59.584
THE AGENCY HAS SEEN SO- AND-

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.218
BASICALLY HOW MUCH. HOW FAR

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:03.321
BEHIND- IN TRYING TO MEET THAT-

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:07.124
THAT NEED. THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:09.460
QUESTION A GOOD MAN I THINK

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.395
THAT- THAT THEY NEED ONCE WE

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:12.597
SOMETIMES A TO CHANGES IN

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.799
FEDERAL POLICY. THAT YOU KNOW AS

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:16.567
WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT TIMES

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.202
WHEN THERE'S BEEN NEED FOR

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.036
REMOVAL DEFENSE THAT'S DIFFERENT

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.172
THAN- PERHAPS NATURALIZATION

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.640
APPLICATIONS AND OTHER YOU KNOW

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.342
RIGHTS DACA BENEFITS THAT THAT

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.711
HAVE. BEEN IN DEMAND AT

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.412
DIFFERENT TIMES SO I THINK THAT

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:29.780
THE TYPE OF CAPACITY WOULD BUILD

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.716
OUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:34.251
HAVE A LEGAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:36.153
OKAY DEPARTMENT GETS FUNDING.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.955
FOR MOBILE DEFENSE IN PARTICULAR

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:39.557
AND THIS IDEA OF EXPANDING THE

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:43.260
CAPACITY THROUGH- VA ACCREDITED-

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.862
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE ACCREDITED

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.530
REPRESENTATIVES IT IS THAT IDEA

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:48.566
THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE DON'T

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:50.201
CONTROL THAT THE PIPELINE FOR

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.570
IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS BUT WE CAN

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:55.573
HELP TRAIN ADDITIONAL- STAFF

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.408
THAT CAN. YOU KNOW THEY CAN HAVE

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.776
THAT AT THE GENERAL

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.077
UNDERSTANDING OF IMMIGRATION

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:02.513
LAWS AND THE ETHICS TRAININGS IN

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.748

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:12.857
CLEARING. ON ON THE PATH THREE.

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:15.126
BENEFITS SO THAT WE IS SOMETHING

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.594
FOR JUST BEHIND THE THING OF A

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:17.728
SUPPORTING THOSE TYPE OF A

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:18.896
CREDIT EUROPE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.164
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:21.265
YEARS OF LAW SCHOOL OF DIFFERENT

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.767
TYPES OF TRAINING. AND WE CAN

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.835

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.344
NOT A PRE SHEET AND I THINK JUST

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.112
THE REFERENCE OF SOME COMMENTS

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:36.847

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:40.618

HOME BASED. CARE GIVERS. WE HAVE

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.052
IT AS SLIGHT DIP I THINK IN THE

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.854
PANDEMIC ANGIE. AT THE DIRECTORS

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.189

JUST LATER ON ON THE SPECIFICS

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:09.498
WE DID SEE. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN

THE IN THE YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:13.268

THAT'S EXPECTS THE TREND WE

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:18.507
WOULD EXPECT AND HOPE TO

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:19.441
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GOING

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:20.976

SO EVERYONE. BE PREPARED IF THE

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:37.778
BIRTH PANGS- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:38.912
WE HAD TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE

01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:40.381
STARTED WORKING ON EASIER AND

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.516
THAT WE NEEDED TO WORK RIGHT.

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.519
AND BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES WAS

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.221
I THINK THIS IDEA THAT WE WERE

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:50.090
GONNA LIVE INVEST. IN FAMILY

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:52.126
RECRUITMENT WE GOT A CHUNK OF

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.794
MONEY TO DO THAT OVER A PERIOD

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:55.729
OF TIME THEN I SHALLOW DOWN AND

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:57.665
ACTUALLY GOTTEN ZEROED OUT. AND

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:59.266
THIS CURRENT YEAR IS THE SECOND

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:00.334
YEAR WERE IN THERE'S BEEN NO

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:02.503
FUNDING UNDER THIS IS THE FIRST

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:05.005
OF PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS THIS I

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.740
THINK- YOU KNOW ASSUMPTION AND I

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:08.842
THINK WE ALL MADE IT AS WE ARE

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:10.244
WORKING IN THE SPACE. THAT WE

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.078
WERE GOING TO GET ENOUGH FOSTER

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:12.880
FAMILIES AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:14.181
BE THERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH

01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:15.249
WE DON'T REALLY NEED THEM

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:16.717
FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO START

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.419
SEEING SAVINGS FROM HAVING

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.953
CHILDREN. PLACED WITH THE

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.955
FAMILIES AND SO- EVERYTHING

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.357
WE'RE KIND EQUALIZE THE KIND OF

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:31.699
BALANCE OUT A WE WOULD. NEED

01:39:31.765 --> 01:39:32.666
THAT DEDICATED FUNDING.

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:34.468
INTERESTINGLY NOT THAT HAVE AND

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.803
- I THINK WE'VE BEEN. IN A WAY

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.204
I'M BIT OF A VICTIM OUR OWN. AND

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:38.872
BEING A TO BETTER FIND. AND A

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:40.874
FINE FAMILY. AND PLACED ON WITH

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.876
AN- BECAUSE WHAT WE SEEN AS-

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.411
OFTEN THE FAMILY IS FOR THAT

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:46.013
CHILD OR FOR THOSE SIBLINGS

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.748
THAT'S MORE THAN ONE SHOULDER

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:49.283
AND- AND THEN WHEN THE FAMILY

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.719
REUNITE. WHICH IS OUR GOAL AND

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:52.986
SHE SAYS THEY DON'T AFRICA

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:55.022
BIOLOGICAL FAMILY. THAT FOSTER

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.623
PARENT WILL SAY YOU KNOW I DON'T

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:57.624
REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE BECAUSE

01:39:57.691 --> 01:39:59.727
I WAS HERE FOR THAT KID. OR FOR

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.995
THOSE CHILDREN. OR AT LEAST THEY

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:03.630
WERE UNABLE IN FORCED LABOR

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.265
UNIFIED BUT WE WANT GUARDIANSHIP

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:08.068
OR ADOPTION. THEY DID THAT THEY

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:09.737
FINALIZE THAT AND THEN THEY'RE

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:11.472
GONE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:13.374
AS BASED RESOURCE. AND SO WHAT I

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.775
THINK WE'VE COME TO REALIZE IS

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.710
THAT. THIS RECRUITMENT AND

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.078
RETENTION MEANS SOMETHING

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:19.847
DIFFERENT IN A SYSTEM WHERE

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.548
WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. OF

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.650
FINDING AND DOING RELATIVE BASED

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:24.885
PLACEMENTS AND THEN GETTING

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.653
CHILDREN IDEALLY EITHER BACK

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.555
WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.124
OR JUST SOME KIND OF PERMANENCE

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:32.359
WITH THOSE. WITH THOSE FAMILIES

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:33.861
WE'RE GONNA JUST HAVE TO KEEP

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.496
DOING THIS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:38.699
BE ABLE TO FIND. SUPPORT RETAIN

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.901
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT MORE

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.703
I THINK IT'S ABOUT DEVELOPING

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:43.971
REALLY JUST BETWEEN THE

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:46.106
CHILDREN. AND THE CARE GIVERS

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.741
THAT CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A

01:40:47.808 --> 01:40:51.345
ADOPTION

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:52.813
WE BE UNABLE TO RE UNIFY THAT

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.483

REALIGNMENT WHICH- MR FREITAS

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:01.635
MENTIONED AT STARBUCKS IMPORTANT

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:04.805
POINT TO THINK ABOUT IN OUR- RFA

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:07.374
RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL CHANGE-

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.843
LIFESPAN. WE HAVE SPONSORED

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.744
LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:13.246
CONCEPT AND CREATED AS A PILOT

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:14.314
IT WAS NOT SOMETIME WITH

01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:16.249
STATEWIDE- WAS NOT MANDATED FOR

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.651
EVERY COUNTY TO DO IT.

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.586
ADDITIONALLY THE REQUIREMENTS

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:20.654
BEING PLACED UNDER RELATIVE

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:22.255
CAREGIVERS WAS NOT SOMETHING

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:23.490
THAT WE REALLY DISCUSSED AT THAT

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:26.159
TIME BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW HAD UP

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:28.362
UNTIL THAT POINT ALLOWED US TO

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:31.198

WHEN IT CAME TO WHETHER WE

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:41.942
RELICENSING. ARE PROVING. AB WE

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.443
SPONSORED WOULD JUST. THE PILOTS

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.077
TOOK AWHILE TO GET OFTEN THEY

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:45.779
WORK OFF THE GROUND AND THAT'S

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:48.782

ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND SO THE

01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:53.887
REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:26.787
THESE FUNDS PRIMARILY THE OFFICE

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.689
THAT. THE OTHERWISE UNFUNDED

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:31.591
AREN'T THEY COST. THIS IS- I

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:32.459
DON'T ONGOING DIFFERENCE OF

01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:35.195
OPINION BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:36.596
THE ADMINISTRATION I'LL JUST

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:39.733
SAY- BUT WE KNOW HOW MUCH THIS

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.902
IS COSTING OVER AND ABOVE. OUR

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:44.738
EXPENDITURES PRIOR TO GOING

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:46.406
STATEWIDE WITH RFA BECAUSE WE DO

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:49.409
A- PROCESS WITH THE STATE. TO

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:51.778
TRACK ALL OF OUR COSTS BEFORE

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.480
AND AFTER SEIZE THE ARTS

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.415
REQUIRED UNDER PROP THIRTY THAT

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.017
WE DO THAT. AND SO IT'S COSTING

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:58.385
COUNTIES A HUNDRED MILLION

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.320
DOLLARS A YEAR OVER IN ABOUT THE

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.154
LICENSING AND APPROVAL

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:03.123
ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAD

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.826
UNDERTAKEN HIGHER NEXT PARTY

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.194
TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. PRIOR

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.129
TO THE MANDATE IN TWENTY

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:11.064
FOURTEEN AND SO WE ARE

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:11.998
REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION

01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:13.767
DOLLARS A YEAR WE'RE ASKING THAT

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.769
THAT BE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.704
WE'RE ASKING THAT IT BE CALLED

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:19.706
RFA. SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:21.174
COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY FUNDED TO

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.809
DO THE WORK AS WE BELIEVE THEY

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.177
SHOULD BE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:26.480
SHIFT. IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO

01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:29.116
IT IS A MUCH BETTER PROCESS

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:30.584
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RELIGION.

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:34.121
THEY NOW GET TRAINING THEY GET-

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.689
ACCESS TO MORE SERVICE THAN THEY

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:43.797
PREVIOUSLY DID. WHEN WE WERE

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:44.331
JUST DOING A SORT OF MORE

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:46.099
CURSORY. AND NOT OF ON. SORT OF

01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:47.534
LICENSE TIGHT OF AGREE LIKE WE

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.970
DO NOW. SO WE SUPPORT IT THERE'S

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.705
NO WAY TO BACK OUT OF THE REMEDY

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:52.906
UNDER PROP IS THIRTY IS TO JUST

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:54.241
NOT DO THE THING THAT MANDATED.

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:55.709
THERE'S REALLY NO WAY NOT TO DO

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:59.012
THIS OR DON'T HAVE FOSTER. SO WE

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.248
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:01.882
I HAD. WORK TOGETHER. TO GET

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:03.750
THIS FUNDED ON ON BY BASIS AND-

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.452
BRACKET THAT IT IS A STATEWIDE

ALTHOUGH AHEAD AND- STOP MY

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:11.057

HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:42.355
TODAY. ON HOW CAN THE STATE-

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.624
BETTER CONNECTS YOUTH IN CARE TO

01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:46.693
FAMILIES AND ALSO WHAT SORTS OF

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.795
FUNDING BY THE STATE BE

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:51.698
CONSIDERING- IN TERMS OF DOING

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:54.801
JUST THAT- I THINK IF I WANT TO

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:57.070
START BY SAYING- YOU KNOW

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.905
CULTURE EATS STRATEGY FOR

01:47:58.972 --> 01:48:01.875
BREAKFAST. AND WE STILL AREN'T

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.844
QUITE THERE IN TERMS OF THE

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:06.246
CULTURE WE'RE BUILDING- I

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.781
THOUGHT THAT MISTER BLAYLOCK'S

01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:10.016
COMMENTS ABOUT HOW CRITICAL IT

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:12.786
IS THAT SERVICES ARE COORDINATED

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:19.125
LOCALLY. AND. AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:22.996
OUR IS AT. ENGAGING FAMILIES AND

01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:24.564
GETTING THEM THE SERVICES AND

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:27.901
SUPPORTS IT AND HAS MISSED-UNDERLING SAID. YOU KNOW THOSE

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:29.469
THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.738
GET DEFINED BY FAMILIES MAYBE

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:34.608
LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.977
PARTICULARLY THINK OF AS YOU

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:38.345
KNOW THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:40.413
OR SERVICES FOR THE THINGS THAT

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.582
WE CURRENTLY FUNDS SO. I THINK

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.951
WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON THAT

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:47.020
AND WE HAVE TO START WITH THE

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:52.559
FAMILIES BEING AT THE TABLE. NOT

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:55.395
JUST INVITED TO THE DINNER- WE

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:59.699
HAVE TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:02.702
WHICH MEANS SOMETMES WE HAVE

01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:04.905
EVENING MEETINGS WE DON'T DO

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:06.106
THEM WHEN THEY'RE MOST

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:08.608
CONVENIENT FOR YOU KNOW THE

01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:12.512
STAFF THAT ARE WORKING- WE HAVE

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:15.348
TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT WE

01:49:15.415 --> 01:49:17.651
GET TO FAMILIES RATHER THAN

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:21.087
EXPECTING THEM TO COME TO US AND

01:49:21.154 --> 01:49:23.690
WE'VE GOT TO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:26.026
TRULY NOT JUST INVITE THEM IN

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:28.128
BUT MAKE THEM A CRITICAL

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:30.130
DECISION MAKER IN THE PROCESS.

01:49:30.196 --> 01:49:31.698
THAT MEANS ENSURING THAT WERE

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:33.833
USING COMMUNITY TO FIND SERVICES

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.869
AND SUPPORTS THAT ENGAGE THOSE

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:37.804
FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT ARE

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.472
CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:43.076
RESPONSIVE SO THEY FEEL NOT JUST

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:46.012
INVITED BUT IN FACT WELCOMES TO

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:49.582
THE PROCESS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:51.785
DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO ENSURING

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:54.020
THAT EVERY CHILD AND YOUTH IN

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:56.856
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IS BEING

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:59.559
ACTIVELY CONNECTED TO RELATIVES

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:02.495
AND NATURAL SUPPORTS. WE SHOULD

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:03.797
NOT AS A SYSTEM BE RAISING

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.298
CHILDREN WE SHOULD BE

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:06.599
INTERVENING AT POINTS WHERE

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.368
FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING AND

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.603
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:14.441
CONNECT TO USED TO THEIR PEOPLE

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.710
- WE REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:18.211
MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:20.080
HAVE ACCESS FAMILY FINDING AN

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:22.515
ENGAGEMENT SERVICES. TO MY

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:25.251
KNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT. THIS

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:27.320
TRACKED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:29.589
THAT I'M AWARE OF. WE DON'T

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:31.391
REALLY EVEN HAVE A CLEAR WORKING

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.259
DEFINITION OF WHAT WOULD BE

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:35.428
REQUIRED TO BE ON THE OUTRAGE

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:38.398
THAT'S CURRENTLY REQUIRED IN LAW

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.300
. WE ARE FOR THE DURING THE

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.102
FIRST THIRTY DAYS THERE HAS TO

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:45.338
BE THAT FAMILY FINDING. I THINK

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:47.640
THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO REALLY

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:49.609
FIND AN ARRAY OF SERVICES AND

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.077
SUPPORTS TO CONNECT YOUTH IN

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:54.014
CARE SO FAMILIES WHICH INCLUDES

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.882
ACTUALLY FUNDING THE FAMILY

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:59.953
FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT SERVICES-

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.255
THE BASIC NEEDS FUNDING THAT

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.391
MISTER BLAYLOCK TALKED ABOUT.

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:06.192
THAT WOULD ALLOW FAMILIES TO

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:08.695
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN LIVE WITH

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:12.032
THEM. BY PROVIDING THINGS LIKE-

01:51:12.098 --> 01:51:13.933
US ADICIONAL SUPPORTS OF A

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.170
FAMILY NEEDS A LARGER SPACE.

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:20.040
RESPITE CARE TO CARE GIVERS THE

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:21.875
KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT MAY

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:25.011
NOT. BE AVAILABLE AND SOME OF

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:27.514
OUR STRUCTURES- WRAPAROUND

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.949
SERVICES PROVIDED TO EVERY CHILD

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.584
AND FAMILY ENGAGED IN CHILD

01:51:31.651 --> 01:51:34.320
WELFARE AGAIN DEFINED BY THE

01:51:34.387 --> 01:51:38.258
FAMILY NOT BY. OUR OWN FISCAL

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:41.061
SYSTEMS. NOT BY WHAT'S MOST

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:43.463
CONVENIENT FOR US BUT HOW THE

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:47.367
FAMILY DEFINES WHAT THEY NEED-

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:49.335
WE REALLY NEED FUNDING FOR

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:51.304
SUPERVISED VISITATION FOR USE

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:54.841
AND CARE. THIS IS OFTEN DONE. BY

01:51:54.908 --> 01:51:56.843
CASE WORKERS FOSTER FAMILY

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.345
AGENCY IS WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT

01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:01.247
AND IF WE'RE REALLY PRIORITIZING

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:03.049
THESE CONNECTIONS WITH FAMILY WE

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:05.051
HAVE TO FUND ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:07.520
SUPPORT. MAKING AND MAINTAINING

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:11.091
THOSE CONNECTIONS- THE PROPOSAL

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.759
IN THE BUDGET THE ONE MILLION

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:14.928
DOLLARS. FOR THE TECHNICAL

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:18.331
ASSISTANCE IS A GREAT START BUT

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:23.169
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A START. WE

01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:25.205
DESPERATELY TO FOR. VARIOUS

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:27.774
FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:30.276
THERE ARE SOME OTHER PROPOSALS-

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:31.845
OF THAT WILL BE COMING BEFORE

01:52:31.911 --> 01:52:34.214
THE LEGISLATURE THAT DO JUST

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.983
THAT AND SO THE TECHNICAL

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.085
ASSISTANCE WILL BE CRITICAL BUT-

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:42.188
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FUND DOING

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:45.258
THE SERVICES. WHETHERIT'S- AT

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:47.026
THE COUNTY LEVEL OR AT THE

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:49.829
PROVIDER LEVEL. EVERYONE SHOULD

01:52:49.896 --> 01:52:52.132
BE ENGAGED IN THAT SHOULD BE

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.666
DOING IT SHOULD BE MAKING IT A

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:57.904
PRIORITY AND WE HAVE TO FUND IT

01:52:57.971 --> 01:53:00.140
- IN ADDITION TO FUNDING THESE

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:02.609
TYPES OF PROPOSALS. THE STATE

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:03.743
HAS TO BUILD IN SOME

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.278
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:07.080
ENSURE THAT ALL YOU THINK HERE

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:09.415

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:13.052
INCLUDES. REQUIRING THAT CFTC'S

SORRY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS FOR

THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:18.491
ACRONYM MUST HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:20.460
PRESENT. THERE HAS TO BE

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.328
DOCUMENTATION THAT SOME OUTRAGE

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:24.864
HAS OCCURRED IN THE EVENT THAT A

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:27.367
FAMILY IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND WE

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.935
HAVE TO CREATE WE HAVE TO

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:30.370
PROVIDE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:33.506
SUPPORTS- THAT CHILDREN AND

01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:36.109
FAMILIES NEED TO WORK ON THAT RE

01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:38.144
ENGAGEMENT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:40.680
SEPARATED. OR TO REMAIN TOGETHER

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:43.583
WHENEVER POSSIBLE. AND FINALLY I

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:44.984
WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.253
MENTION TAT WE THAT AS WE

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.455
CELEBRATE THE REDUCTION OF YOUTH

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:46.499
I'VE- TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.301

THAT FAMILIES FINDING. AND

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:52.839

DATA MINING YOU'RE NOT JUST

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.942
LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.410
A COURT HEARING YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:59.545

THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU THEY

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.424
MAY NOT EVEN KNOW IN SOME CASES

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:13.326
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND A

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.228
RELATIVE- THEY MAY NOT EVEN

01:57:15.294 --> 01:57:17.263
KNOW. THAT THERE IS A CHILD AT

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:19.031
ALL IN THEIR FAMILY OR A

01:57:19.098 --> 01:57:20.666
CERTAINLY THAT THE CHILD HAS

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:22.235
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A REPORT OF

01:57:22.301 --> 01:57:23.169
A DECENT LIKE THAT CAN BE REALLY

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:25.304
TRICKY AND SO THERE'S WORK TO BE

01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:27.440
DONE WITH THAT AND THEN TRYING

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.909
TO ENGAGE IN THAT PERSON'S LIFE.

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.778
EVEN IF WE DON'T END UP PLACING

01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:34.480
THE CHILD WITH THEM WE WANNA TRY

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:35.581
TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:37.283
THEM WE MAY FIND MORE THAN ONE

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:39.552
PERSON WHO'D BE A GOOD. PLACE

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:41.287
FOR THE CHILD TO LIVE THEY ONLY

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:43.489
LIVE IN ONE PLACE AND SO WE CAN

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:44.957
TRY TO HELP GROW THOSE

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:51.697
RELATIONSHIPS STUDENTS FUNDING-

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:53.466
NOT JUST FIND. BURKE ABSOLUTE OF

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:55.001
PROJECT PLACE SO THERE. A LOT

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:56.202
THAT GOES INTO IT SOMETIME AT

01:57:56.269 --> 01:57:58.004
IT'S HARD TO. DO YOU YOU A

01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:59.305
NUMBER BUT I WELL WELL IT WAS OF

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:01.107
THE WAY I MEAN I KNOW YOU. GIVE

01:58:01.174 --> 01:58:02.975
UP. NUMBER AND I WILL. I OF

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:04.010
SERVICE YOU TALK ABOUT IS NOT

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:04.944
KNOW IT'S NOT NEARLY PUTTING OUT

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:06.312
ADS AND COUNTY COUNTY PEOPLE

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:08.848
SAID YES I WILL. DO THIS- BUT I

01:58:08.915 --> 01:58:10.082
THINK WE WE'VE HAD PREVIOUS

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:13.052
EXPERIENCE. I'M JUST. I THINK IT

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:15.488
IS IMPORTANT TO. IDENTIFY THE

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:18.191
METRICS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW IF

01:58:18.257 --> 01:58:19.926
WE ROLL OUT THE PROGRAM WHETHER

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:22.762
ONE TRACK OR NOT- AND YOU KNOW

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.197
FRANKLY PEOPLE DO WANT. A BUDGET

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:25.698
COMMITTEE ON SOME ACCOUNTABILITY

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:30.903
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT AT.

01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:31.971
LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:32.972
TARGETS AS TO- YOU KNOW HOW. A

01:58:33.039 --> 01:58:34.106
WE'RE GOING TO A HUNDRED.

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:35.374
DOLLARS MANY YOU KNOW HOW HOW

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:37.977
MANY MORE KIDS- YOU KNOW FOSTER

01:58:38.044 --> 01:58:40.112
YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:41.380
HAVE. TO HAVE A FAMILY PLACEMENT

01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:43.449
AND- BETTER OR SOMETHING SO. I

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:45.351
THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO. HAVE SOME

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:47.587
METRICS AS TO WHAT THE

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:51.157
INVESTMENT SHOULD RESULT IN. AND

01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:52.058
WHETHER THERE'S INFORMATION FROM

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:53.359
. YOU KNOW WHAT WE FUNDED IN THE

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:55.661
PAST THAT MIGHT HELP INFORM THAT

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:57.163
ANY DIESELS NOT SIR LIKE WHAT

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:58.431
WE'RE GOING TO GET EXACTLY YOU

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.299
KNOW WHAT THE THREE HUNDRED OR

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:01.901
SOMETHING X. NUMBER FAMILIES.

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:04.504
BUT I THINK IT I THINK THAT AT

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.137
LEAST SOME METRIC OF THE TERMS

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:07.173
OF. OF A FOSTER YOUTH WOULD NOW

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.708
HAVE YOU KNOW CERTAIN LEVEL

01:59:08.774 --> 01:59:10.076
PLACEMENT THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:13.880
OR SOMETHING TO THAT THAT THAT

01:59:13.946 --> 01:59:15.147
WITHOUT. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:17.483
WE DOCTOR BE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:18.251
A REALLY POINT AT- AN AREA THAT

01:59:18.317 --> 01:59:19.352
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MEMORY

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:20.553
MENTIONED THERE'S ALL THESE DATA

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.154
AVAILABLE. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:23.523
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:24.757
MOVEMENT OF THE NEEDLE AS WE

01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:26.759
WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IS JUST THE

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:29.328
STRAIGHT UP. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:30.830
THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.932
FOSTER CARE ARE WITH A RELIGION.

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.567
RIGHT IF YOU BACK OUT THE

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:35.902
GUARDIAN TOOK PLACE OF THE

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.403
ADOPTIVE PLACEMENTS YEAH ALL OF

01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:38.938
THAT STUFF AND THE OTHER FAMILY

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.840
TYPE OF SETTINGS. SOMEWHERE

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:42.909
BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND 42% IT'S

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:44.110
GONE UP AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:46.312
OVER THE LAST. YOU KNOW EIGHT TO

01:59:46.379 --> 01:59:47.713
NINE YEARS NOW IT'S NOT REALLY

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:50.283
GROWN AS MUCH AS I THINK WE

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.551
HOPE. AND SO THAT MIGHT BE AN

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:53.853
AREA TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND SEE.

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.454
IF WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THAT

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:57.523
NEEDLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY

01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:59.325
AT THIS MANY MORE CHILDREN. YOU

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:01.894
KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO I'D BE HAPPY

02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:03.162
TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND WITH

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:05.965
THAT STAFF OF COURSE- DR POLK

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.333
WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M WE

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.968
WORK WELL WITH AND SEE TO IT YOU

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:10.870
KNOW HOW DO WE KIND OF THINK

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:11.971
ABOUT THAT. AS WE LOOK AT TRYING

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.739
TO MAKE THAT KIND OF THE LAST.

02:00:13.806 --> 02:00:14.740
OKAY NO THAT'S RIGHT AND I

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:16.475
APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO REMIND

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.644
PEOPLE THAT- THAT JUST BY THE

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.146
RIGHT NUMBER RIGHT IT'S NOT

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:21.547
GONNA BE A HUNDRED PERCENT.

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:23.382
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF WEATHER

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:25.251
CIRCUMSTANCE AND OTHER REASONS-

02:00:25.318 --> 02:00:26.919
IT'S- CERTAINLY SHOULD BE MUCH

02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:29.288
HIGHER THAN ZERO. AND SO YOU

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:31.057
KNOW I THINK IDENTIFYING THE

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:32.925
TARGET RANGE SHALL AND KNOWING

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:34.927
WHAT. DATA LEAD TO DATA FIND AT

02:00:34.994 --> 02:00:36.929
TARGET. AND IF THE CASE SOME OF

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:38.297
THE SOME OF THOSE NUMBER THE

02:00:38.364 --> 02:00:39.498
BASELINE NUMBERS CHANGE THAT

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:40.967
WOULD CHANGE A TARGET BUT I

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:42.902

RIGHT. TENDERING MCCONNELL ABOUT

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.065

02:36:20.871 --> 02:36:23.307
MATTER THEY WERE EXPECTED TO BE

02:36:23.373 --> 02:36:24.742
AT WORK AND THEY CAME TO WORK.

02:36:24.808 --> 02:36:26.043
IT WAS SCARY AT FIRST I REMEMBER

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:27.544
AN INSTANCE EARLY ON WHEN WE

02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:28.812
LEARNED THAT A CHILD WASN'T

02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:30.781
COMING TO SCHOOL THAT DAY

02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:32.916
BECAUSE HE TESTED POSITIVE. AND

02:36:32.983 --> 02:36:34.218
ONE OF OUR TEACHERS RIGHT THERE

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:36.653
BURST INTO TEARS. SHE REACHED

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:38.522
DOWN AND TIED THAT SHOOT THAT

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:40.891
KIDS SHOES THE DAY BEFORE. AND

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:43.327
SHE HAD A ONE YEAR OLD AT HOME

02:36:43.393 --> 02:36:45.996
AND SHE WAS SCARED. I SEE THAT

02:36:46.063 --> 02:36:47.297
WE WERE BLESSED DURING HIS ON

02:36:47.364 --> 02:36:49.600
GOING ON OKAY NINETEEN DOWN DOWN

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:52.336
BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE BRIEF

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:54.138
CLOSURE DURING THIS TIME. MOST

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:55.439
OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:56.907
INFECTED IT SEEMS LIKE ABOUT

02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:59.777
HOUSES WERE SECOND JANUARY OF

02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:01.044
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND THE

02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:02.980
OTHER HALF OF THE LAST COUPLE OF

02:37:03.046 --> 02:37:04.181
MONTHS. EVEN WITH THE VACCINE

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:06.650
MANDATE THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:08.685
IN AUGUST. FORTUNATELY WELL A

02:37:08.752 --> 02:37:10.053
NUMBER OF TEACHERS HEADS HAVE

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.089
HAD SOME PRETTY SERIOUS SYMPTOMS

02:37:12.156 --> 02:37:14.191
ONLY ONE AND HER HUSBAND. WERE

02:37:14.258 --> 02:37:15.726
HOSPITALIZED AND THEY RECOVERED

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:18.362
FULLY. HOWEVER THE OMICRON VERY

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:20.164
IS REALLY HAMPERING OUR ABILITY

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:22.533
TO STAY FULLY STAFFED. MY WIFE

02:37:22.599 --> 02:37:23.934
NEEDED TO WORK IN THE CLASSROOM

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:25.669
YESTERDAY AND SHE'LL BE AND ONCE

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:29.072
HE'S IN ONE TODAY THIS AFTERNOON

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:30.073
BECAUSE OF TEACHERS OUT WITH

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:31.675
PROGRAM. THE THING THAT IS SAVED

02:37:31.742 --> 02:37:33.544
AS FINANCIALLY DURING THE PAST

02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:34.845
TWO YEARS HAS BEEN THE STATE

02:37:34.912 --> 02:37:36.280
FUNDING OUR CONTRACTOR FULL

02:37:36.346 --> 02:37:37.915
REGARDLESS OF OUR ENROLLMENT OR

02:37:37.981 --> 02:37:40.484
ATTENDANCE. SOMETHING REFERRED

02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:42.419
TO AS THE HOLD HARMLESS. WITH

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.021
DRASTICALLY REDUCED CLASS AND

02:37:44.087 --> 02:37:45.789
GROUP SIZES BEING DICTATED BY

02:37:45.856 --> 02:37:47.090
THE PANDEMIC AND WITH ALL THE

02:37:47.157 --> 02:37:48.492
CLEANING AND ADDED SAFETY

02:37:48.559 --> 02:37:51.595
PROTOCOLS THAT REQUIRE MORE

02:37:51.662 --> 02:37:52.996
STAFF TIME AND COST. WE NEED ALL

02:37:53.063 --> 02:37:55.465
THE STAFF WE GET EVEN WITH YOUR

02:37:55.532 --> 02:37:58.001
KIDS IN THE CLASSROOMS. NOW DUE

02:37:58.068 --> 02:38:00.070
TO THE OPENING UP OF OUR STATE

02:38:00.137 --> 02:38:01.205
AND THE DROPPING OF MASK

02:38:01.271 --> 02:38:02.940
MANDATES WE ARE CLEARLY GOING TO

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:04.775
TRY TO LIVE WITH. AS WE DO WITH

02:38:04.842 --> 02:38:07.211
OTHER DISEASE. HOWEVER IT STILL

02:38:07.277 --> 02:38:10.380
MAKES PEOPLE SICK KIDS TEACHERS

02:38:10.447 --> 02:38:11.815
AND STUDENTS AWAY FROM SCHOOL.

02:38:11.882 --> 02:38:14.418
BBC COALITION IS REQUESTING A

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:16.253
CONTINUATION OF THIS HOLD

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.589
HARMLESS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. AS WE

02:38:18.655 --> 02:38:20.023
ARE NO DOUBT GOING TO HAVE

02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:23.327
ONGOING VARIANTS THAT WILL MAKE

02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:24.127
CLASSROOMS AND FILL THEM WITH

02:38:24.194 --> 02:38:26.496
KIDS. WHICH BRINGS ME NOW TO THE

02:38:26.563 --> 02:38:27.831
NEWEST AND BIGGEST THREAT FOR

02:38:27.898 --> 02:38:29.766
CENTERS AND THAT IS STAFF. IN

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.668
THE LAST NINE MONTHS WE'VE LOST

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:32.636
THREE TEACHERS TO SCHOOL

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:34.104
DISTRICTS WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY

02:38:34.171 --> 02:38:36.073
CATER TWELVE WORLD PAYS MUCH

02:38:36.139 --> 02:38:37.941
BETTER. NOW THAT TRANSITIONAL

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:39.376
CAN YOU'RE GONNA GUARD HAS BEEN

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:41.044
GREEN LIGHTED SQUAD RUBLE IN

02:38:41.111 --> 02:38:43.146
SIZE IN LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS

02:38:43.213 --> 02:38:45.415
FROM NW. AND EXPERTS SAY

02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:47.718
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED ABOUT

02:38:47.784 --> 02:38:49.586
SIXTEEN THOUSAND UTK TEACHERS

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:51.722
OVER THOSE THREE. YEARS AN

02:38:51.788 --> 02:38:54.391
OBVIOUS STRATEGY IS FOR THEM TO

02:38:54.458 --> 02:38:55.859
GO AFTER THE WORK FORCE AND

02:38:55.926 --> 02:39:00.397
ALREADY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH.

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:02.332
T. K. H. HERE. OUR WORK FOR. RCS

02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:05.002
PPG. I LITERALLY HEARD ON JUNE.

02:39:05.068 --> 02:39:06.703
THAT THAT IS GREAT STRATEGY TO

02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:09.473
GO AFTER SCHOOL THIS. I HAVE

02:39:09.539 --> 02:39:10.440
THREE MORE TEACHERS WHO ARE

02:39:10.507 --> 02:39:11.942
PREGNANT WITH SPRING AND SUMMER

02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:14.144
BABIES AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING A

02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:15.245
HARD TIME JUST GETTING

02:39:15.312 --> 02:39:18.282
APPLICANTS TO REPLACE THEM AND

02:39:18.348 --> 02:39:20.217
FULLY STAFFED FOR OUR CENTERS.

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:21.652
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN POSSIBLY

02:39:21.718 --> 02:39:23.453
RETAIN TEACHERS BY UPPING THEIR

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:25.122
PAY AND BENEFITS AND THE ONLY WE

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:27.491
CAN WE CAN DO THAT AS WITH

02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:28.458
HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR

02:39:28.525 --> 02:39:31.461
CENTERS. AS YOU KNOW IN CONCERT

02:39:31.528 --> 02:39:32.329
WITH THE BOW TO EXPAND

02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:33.964
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN LAST

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:35.499
YEAR THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATORS

02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:37.167
ALSO APPROVE SOMETHING CALLED

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:39.136
RATE REFORM FOR INDUSTRY. AND

02:39:39.202 --> 02:39:40.671
TOOK A STEP OF CONVERTING A

02:39:40.737 --> 02:39:42.506
REIMBURSEMENT RATE HE TO CSPD

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:46.310
CONTRACTORS TO ONE BASED ON A ON

02:39:46.376 --> 02:39:49.713
REGIONAL MARKET RATES. THIS IS

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:52.082
SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORTED OUT

02:39:52.149 --> 02:39:54.251
OF A SENSE OF FAIRNESS. AS

02:39:54.318 --> 02:39:56.086
OBVIOUSLY HIGH COST REGIONS IN

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:58.422
THE SATE SHOULD BE PAID HIGHER

02:39:58.488 --> 02:40:00.157
RATES THAN LOW CASARES OF THE

02:40:00.223 --> 02:40:02.292
STATE I SUPPORTED WITH THIS

02:40:02.359 --> 02:40:03.727
BECAUSE THERE WAS ALSO SUPPOSED

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:05.028
TO BE UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS THE

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:06.296
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR

02:40:06.363 --> 02:40:08.365
CONTRACTORS SUCH AS US. BASED ON

02:40:08.432 --> 02:40:09.800

FOR EVERY EIGHT CHILDREN. BUT

02:40:21.878 --> 02:40:23.647
THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES THAT

02:40:23.714 --> 02:40:25.582

02:40:27.584 --> 02:40:30.454
BASED ON STAFFING RATIOS OF ONE

02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.556
ADULT FOR TWELVE CHILDREN. WHICH

02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:34.925

QUALITY ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE.

02:40:45.168 --> 02:40:46.403
HOWEVER NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT

02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:47.938
THIS RATE DISPARITY FOR THE

02:40:48.005 --> 02:40:50.173
