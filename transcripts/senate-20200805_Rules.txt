IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION AND FUNDING THAT WE'VE PASSED TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME. AREAS AREAS IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU.

THE LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES. IN GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVES TO OUR HOUSING. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION YEAH WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT AND LET ME- LET ME SAY THAT FIND. H. C. V. ED TO BE JUST AS PRODUCTIVE- PERHAPS EVEN MORE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE 75% OVER THE MAN. WORKING REMOTELY- IN FACT I BELIEVE THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK IN THE JOB I SO THE RISK. EMPLOYEES FEEL VERY PRODUCTIVE HELLO OF COURSE WE ARE MY PHILOSOPHY IS THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE PRODUCING RESULTS. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY AND- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. NOW IN THE CONTEXT OFF OF YOUR QUESTIONABOUT HOW. THE WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT OUR STOCK REMAINS EXTREMELY ENGAGED IN THIS FIVE OH OF THIS PANDEMIC AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR STAFF WITH THE TECHNOLOGY WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDING THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT. TO CITIES COUNTIES. IN ORGANIZATION WHETHER YOU STILL ARE FUND PRO. OUR ROLE A RADIO I AS I SAID IT'S A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED AND SO FORTH. ARE PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE IS HOME KEEPING HOME KEEP PROGRAM. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK MORE. ABOUT THIS BUT- WE HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE DEDICATED SOLELY TO PERFORM CONSULTATIONS DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN THE- OF. ALL OF OUR OF CAVITE- SO THAT WE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION THAT. WE CAN ANSWER ABOUT THE VIABILITY THE FEASIBILITY OF ACQUIRING FACILITIES AT TO MOVE TO INTERNING AND PERMANENT HOUSING WE WHERE YOU'RE SEEING. ALSO INCLUDES WE'RE CALLING PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY WORKSHOP ONLINE WORKSHOPS WEBINARS UNITE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING USING TECHNOLOGY THAT WAY TO CON YOU OUT ASKING. AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR PORTSMOUTH THIS YOU KNOW DON'T KEEP OUR EYES OFF OR FORCED INTO. SAYS WE ENGAGE COMING TO OUR- TUITIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT GIVEN OUR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY SO OVERALL FUNDING AS A RITE AID OR AS. A. IN AB VERY PRODUCTIVE WAY IN DECEMBER WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND JUST MAYBE A- QUICK FOLLOW UP. YOU DID REFERENCE THE PROJECT HOME KEY WE NOW STARTED THIS PROJECT ROOM KEY IS AN IMMEDIATE REACTION TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AND- PROVIDING HOMELESS PEOPLE WITH SHELTER PLACE TO QUARANTINE IN. THE NATION OF COURSE TO TRANSITION FROM TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT HOUSING AND I BELIEVE. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED. TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. A LOT OF MONEY OVR A HALF BILLION DOLLARS BUT SPREAD AROUND THE STATE- HOW HOW IS THAT DISTRIBUTION GOING AND- WHAT IS THE LOCAL PARTNER CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE FUNDING. RIGHT THANK YOU STAFF FOR THAT QUESTION IS- IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THIS A PROGRAM HOME GIVE IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNOR ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO IT'S REALLY MORE THAN A PROGRAM IS OUR MISSION I WOULD SAY. I SHELTERS TAKE CARE OF BLOOD NINE AT NIGHT BERMAN AND HOUSING TAKES CARE OF HOUSING INSTABILITY AT ANY PEOPLE HAVE A STABLE HOME THEY HAVE A PART. OF THEIR LIFE BACK THEY CAN CALL IN A FEW STEPS TOWARDS SELF SUFFICIENCY TERMS ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY- BECAUSE BENEFIT ANALYSIS WE KNOW THAT ENSURING OUT THE FIRST HOUSING MODEL PEOPLE GOING FROM HOMELESSNESS TO. INTERIM AND PERMANENT HOUSING IS THE RIGHT MODEL BECAUSE YOU FACE A LOT MORE MONEY FROM FROM OTHER SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE HAVEN'T. HERE YEAH I THINK THE WAY KNOW THE SEASON A IS A IS A GREAT I'LL- I. OFF OF GIVING BRITISH I THAT MAKE THAT WERE FACING OUR- AT THIS BOTTOM BUT LOOK. IN THE GOT HAS RECEIVED BIG THE- MOUNT SILVA FEDERAL. ASSISTANCE TO PREVENT RATES OF INFECTION INCLUDING VULNERABLE PEOPLE SUCH AS THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND- IT'S KIND OF BEING AWAY OPPORTUNISTIC HERE THE HOME DEPOT HOUSES MANY ON SHELTER CALIFORNIA SINCE THAT'S WHAT. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN MAKE RIGHT. TO HIS ARM DOLLARS EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. SO THAT'S WHY IT SOON AS THE OPEN OR ANNOUNCED THE PROGRAM WE COULDN'T WASTE ANY TIME WE IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE DESIGN. TO ALL OF OUR- I GUIDELINE FOR THE PROGRAM WE SHOULD NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. ONLY A COUPLE AGO. BUT I ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I'M GATHERING FROM MY TEAM. IS A AYE FEELS MAKES ME FEEL UP. WE ARE CONTEMPLATING SEVERAL VIABLE PLANS RIGHT NOW- I MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS REDDING M. F. FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES TO. MOVE QUICKLY. GEN I GREW UP WITH FISH PURCHASING OF MISTRUST RESENTMENT COM BURNHAM. AT RIGHT AWAY IN REMEMBER MY NAME GEN OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANT CONSULTATIONS- ARE REQUIRED IN THAT WOULD BE. NOT I DONE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED AS A PREREQUISITE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONSULTATIONS WITH WITH THE POTENTIAL APPLICANTS WE ARE REQUIRING THIS YEAR BECAUSE I GAINES. SURE THAT WORST. IN THE- EXPAND DEADLINE AND I BASED ON THE VOLUME OF CONSUL BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHIC THIS OF CONSERVE THE NATURE OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT- THE READING THIS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF PURCHASE JUST DAYS THAT MEANS UNITS AVAILABLE. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALL OF THIS INFORMATION THAT I'M I'M RECEIVING THAT VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME MAKES ME THINK THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY BE REALIZED IS GREAT VISION OF THE GOVERNOR IN USING THIS FUNDS AND SO FAR IN SUCH A SHORT TIME WE ALREADY HAVE. A WHEN. I COMPLETE APPLICATIONS IN THE CAR SO WE'RE MOVING VERY. I THIS IS OUR OF A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY AND I WON ADJUSTING THE LEGISLATURE FOR. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET- GIVING ALL THE AUTHORITY TO SPEND NOT ONLY BE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL. FUNDS FOR HOME GAME BUT ALSO FIFTY MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS HEARING FROM JOHN PAUL THANK YOU AND I AM RESEARCHER JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT. AREA YOU KNOW THE HUGE CHALLENGE IN SAN THE BAY AREA OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES ELIGIBLE ALSO FOR APPLICATION FOR THIS PROJECT MONEY HOUSE HOW DOES HOW DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT OVERSEE THE DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YEAH WE ARE FIRM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT THAT THESE PROGRAM REQUIRES- ATTENTION IN TERMS OF THE GEOGRAPH IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SET ASIDE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF DOLLARS BY BY REGION- I'M AT FOR THE FOR- FOR JUST THE STAGE THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AT THINGS THE FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY HAS MADE A BET. AND I CAME BACK ON THE BONES OF THE WE AND WE'VE BEEN AT COND DOT IT'S SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIST OF ALL THE YOU KNOW COUNTY CITIES THAT HAVEBEEN CALLING ASKING ABOUT HOW. THIS PROGRAM AND WE SEE IT YOU KNOW ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU KNOW A LOT OF INTEREST SO I AGAIN THAT I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT ALSO IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIC THIS. WE MAY BE ABLE TO SEE GOOD RESULTS- OF THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THESE- THE FACILITIES THAT THEY ARE- INTENDING TO. TO APPLY FOR A PURCHASE I ARE VIABLE DAY TO DAY THERE ARE- THERE FEASIBLE THAT THAT THERE WILL RANDY- TO DRINK AND- TO BURNING DURING AN AND NOT. THING BY. HEY I'M CAUGHT AND SENT OUT I. ALTHOUGH WITH YOUR STAFF MAKE SURE THEY THEY ALSO GETTING FOR ABOUT WHAT FROM FROM FROM WHICH COUNTY SAN CITIES APPLICATIONS THAT WERE ARE ARE COMING FROM BUT BUT- BUT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALSO AS A PERTAINS TO GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICT. THANK YOU SIR- AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT WE APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING YOUR EXPERTISE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD APPRECIATE AT YOUR CONVENIENCE JUST SEEING THAT CURRENTLY OF THE- APPLICATIONS THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER MINE SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU THE SHARE WILK. CAN A DIFFERENT MEMBER WHO'S. BUT CONGRATULATIONS ON EUROPE MR LAST HOUSE AND WE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A TELECONFERENCE AND IT WAS VERY ILLUMINATING AND YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE BACKGROUND TO STEP INTO WHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE HERE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONE WE'VE HAD IN IN OUR STATE WITH A PANDEMIC A AND HOUSING ISSUES- AND I'VE SPENT I THINK WE SPENT MOST OF OUR DISCUSSION ON THAT PROJECT KEY THAT WENT FROM PROJECT ROOM KEY TO PROJECT HOME KEY. AND MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AND ARE MAKING SURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE FUNDING FOR WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY COME TO SHARE IF YOU ARE IN MY DISTRICT ARE WE HAVE AND ROOM KEY ISSUES ARE A COUPLE OF THE FEDERAL YOU KNOW ABOUT A YEAR AGO BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS SO IT'S A BIG ISSUE. I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE MORE ADD TO THAT I THINK CENTER MONEY COVERED THE ISSUE DID HELP ON. ON THIS WAS BEFORE THE RULES COMMITTEE ARE. LAST MONTH THE THIS HAD A- ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND MOTEL ROOMS THAT MIGHT HAVE UNDER KEY. HOME KEY. AND BUT ONLY 60% OF THEM WERE STILL OCCUPIED SO THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE AN ISSUE OF. YOU KNOW HAVING THE ROOMS FIRST AND THEN TRYING TO GET THE OCCUPANTS INTO THEM OR ARE WE DOING SOME SORT OF BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE. LOOKING AT ME WITHOUT THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS I'M NOT SURE AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THEM. OR RECRUITING THEM THROUGH THE SERVICE THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR A NUMBER OF THEM. SO THAT WE HAVE THAT WRAP AROUND SIR. THAT YOU'LL FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HOUSING AND THEN. WITH THE PACKAGE LET'S SAY OF THIS WRAPAROUND PROVIDING SERVICES AND THEN. A HOME ARE WE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING TOO MANY ROOMS THAT WE CAN'T BEEN OCCUPIED BECAUSE CAN'T GET FULL. WE WORK ON THE BALLOT THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THE- I WANT TO SAY IS UNDER DO WANNA MAKE THAT THE- BEWEEN APPROACH ROOM A AND HOME KEY. TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AFTER ROOM I WASN'T. TO WERE POWER OF A BY WORK GROUP BOTH OF THESE. A ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY HAVE BEEN- EFFORTS THAT ARE NOT JUST- ON. ONE SINGLE DEPARTMENT IT'S BEEN AN EFFORT LED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BETTER WITHOUT A WIDE RANGE OF AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED. WE WERE NOT- I SYMBOLIC WITH PROJECT ROOM KEY- I WAS MORE OF A MASTER LEASING SUPPORT TELLS HIM WHAT TELLS- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. WAS VERY INVOLVED YES I THINK I CAN THE NUMBER WAS CLOSE. TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND HOTELS AND HOTEL ROOMS- I COULD JUST JUST TRYING OF CAUGHT. IN THE INSPECTION IN THIS. BOB YOU CAN IN MOVING A ANGELS TO NON COM AT UNITS AND SO THAT WAS SO OF THE IMPORTANT PRIORITY IMMEDIATE PRIORITY PART OF THE EMERGE PUBLIC IN. OUR WHOLE KEY IS IT'S NOW UP THAT THAT WE ARE TAKING THE LEAD ON WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THAT BUT WE ARE TAKING THESE BECAUSE WE ARE OPERATING HAS. DIAZ THAT THE FUNDING THE MECHANISM TO. WHY ARE THESE FACILITIES PURCHASE FACILITIES WITH THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT GENERAL MONNING WAS REFERRING TO. THAT THAT IS AN APP FOR THAT THAT WE ARE HEATING AND I. WANNA SAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE SENATE OR THAT SOME OF THOSE. HOTELS MOTELS. THE FACILITIES THAT WERE USED ON THE ROOM KEY COULD BE CONTENT BUT AT A LOCAL COMMUNITIES MAY BE CONTEMPLATING- I AM APPLYING ON THEIR HOME KEY FOR THOSE FACILITIES BUT BUT WE'VE MADE HOME Q. A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN JUST HOTELS MOTELS WE'RE CONTEMPLATING IN ALL OTHER TYPES OF FACILITIES AND YES I CAN BE EFFECTIVE IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE TARGET POPULATION IS PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCE ON THIS VISIT OUR RISK OF SHOPPING FACT BE THE IDEA HERE IS TO- RECEIVE APPLICANTS THAT ARE NOT ONLY CONTEMPLATING MEDIA. PEOPLE MEANING TO THE THESE YOUNG BUT THE REHABBING. AND BE THE OPERATE AND MAY THIS MISS TO KEEP THESE FOR A THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND HOUSING FOR THE INTENDED PER PURPOSE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME MANY MANY MAY BE THAT SOME OF THESE THAT REMAINS AND COUNTIES ARE WORKING AT THE HOTELS MOTELS USED FOR ROOM KEY FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT I BUT IT DOES IT BOTHER ME IT MY OWN THAT I WHAT EARLIER THAT THE EIGHT MANY OF THESE. ARE. GOOD PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MODELS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES ON SITE I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS WORKED VERY WELL IN THE PAST AND WE HOPE THAT APPLICANTS. INCLUDE MODEL. THEY ARE APPLYING FOR HOME KEEP. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND THAT DISTINCTION PERFECT THINK THERE'S A LITTLE CONFUSION PROBABLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO. ABOUT ARE WE ACQUIRING THESE ROOM KEYS WILL THEY BECOME THAT THE HOME KEY. PROJECT HOME KEY BECAUSE I THINK OUR DISCUSSION YESTERDAY WE SPOKE ON BOTH VERY- CONCERNED ABOUT ENSURING THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE THERE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR. ALL THOSE BECAUSE HOUSING FIRST IS IMPORTANT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OF FOR A POPULATION THAT REALLY NEEDS A LOT MORE SERVICE AND GUIDANCE- IN TERMS OF BOB I THINK BEING FREE FROM THE EXPAND THE INDEPENDENCE OF. FINDING IT ALTHOUGH. YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ARCAND. AND I WILL BE CHECKING BACK WITH MY LOCA GOVERNMENT STUFF BEFORE WE HAVE THE CONFIRMATION VOTE THAT TODAY I WILL BE ABSTAINING JUST SO I CAN DIAL BACK IN ACTUALLY ON PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AT MY LOCAL.

I'M KIND OF SURE COVERT NINETEEN HOW THAT'S AFFECTING YOUR STAFF IN THE MANY- SOME BOARDS AND AGENCIES THAT YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT. WELL LET'S START THERE AND THEN HAD A FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE SPECIFIC IMPACT ON EXTERNALLY ON COVERT NINETEEN THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MONEY I THINK THE CALL THE OTHER DAY IT WAS GREAT TO SEE WITH YOU. I DID NOT INTEND AMERICANS HIT THE APART. PORTED ROSE WITHIN THE- SO THE FIRST THING THAT IS WE NEEDED AFTER IN FACT DIDN'T MAKING OUR EMPLOYEES STAY AT HOME THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND I'LL- HOW CAN WE GET OUR EMPLOYEE TO BE A- WORK FROM HOME. AND STILL. SERVICE IT WOULD PROVIDE TO THE LAST TWO CONSUMERS OF CALIFORNIA ARE OFTEN OF THE- SYSTEMS THEY WE- FORWARD AND- THEM. OUR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO WORK HOME AND AGAIN ARTICLE ARE OUR BREAD AND- THEY REALLY ARE END OF THE WE NEED TO PROTECT AND SO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE THEM WORKING FROM HOME NOT OLD. LAPTOP I. THANK THE END. THE DATA IS. THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS BE TO THOSE DATABASES FROM HOME WHILE STILL MAINTAIN SO AND THEN. AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID I THINK WE ARE ABLE 28% OF OUR INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE TO BE THIS. WELLS I'M I'M- FOR SOME IN THE IN NEED AT THIS IN THE- AND THAT ARE. DURING AN ARM MALE SIR. AND THOSE. ARE ABOUT WE SURE THAT WE I'M GIVING. IT PP. SO THIS THING WHERE FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUALS. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GET INTO. YOU IT TURNED OUT. A LOT OF COMMUNICATION. BUT THEN I ALSO GET THAT IN. OUT TO ALL OF OUR LIFE. AND WE UTILIZE SOCIAL% MEDIA WE UTILIZE EMAILS AND THEN WE ALSO UTILIZED- EMAILS TO THE LICENSEES IN PARTICULAR. I'M ALSO GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT TO CONSUMERS AND MAKING ANY CHANGES POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE WAS GUIDANCE THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA. HELLO AND WE TO MAKE SURE IMPACT ARE SO LIKE BASE THAT WE SURE IN WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION SO WE POSTED THAT ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL AND THEN LOOKING REALLY TO HELP PUBLIC AND CONSUMERS WE REALLY STARTED OUT WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR LIVES BECAUSE SINCE HE'S A REAL BASIS IN. INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE TWO WORLDS AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PRACTICE AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BECOMING POSSIBLE KOBE NINETEEN. AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT AS SOME OF OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS NEEDED TO BE A WAIT IN ORDER FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO. PERFORM THEIR SERVICES. AND IN LICENSE OR GET LICENSE AND SO WE ACTUALLY MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION I'M WITH OUR AGENCIES SECRETARY AND REALLY. WELL TO PUSH FORWARD EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THE UNDERSIGNED THAT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF CELLS TO FIND. WEAVER'S FIRSTPRIZE AND SO AS SOON THAT AND THAT WAS RELEASED OVER THE- WE RECEIVE A BIT ALMOST HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO REQUETS FOR WAIVERS- AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THOSE FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF IT YOU KNOW HOW IT. CAN IMPACT A LARGE GROUP. ORANGE BOWL SOME OF THE ONES WE ISSUED WEDNESDAY I'M WAITING SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION SO INDIVIDUALS COULD STILL REMAIN LICENSE. AND THEN ALSO THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD RECENTLY RETIRED SO BRINGING THEM BACK INTO. THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE AS WELL AND THEN WE ALSO WORKED OUTSIDE OF EVEN THAT WE PROCESS IN. TESTING THE- JUST BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE WORD THE BEING ABLE TO IN THE- FROM. OF CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN ANY SEARCH THAT MAY HAPPEN. SO WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S REALLY HOW- WE'VE REALLY BEEN IMPACTED BY HOPE NINETEENTH ONE RATING IS THAT WE USE. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS WITHIN OUR LICENSING BOARD IMPERILS. TO MAKE IN THE WORKABLE BOTH LIFE AND ENFORCE. AND OBVIOUS SOMETHING WE HAD THE- WITH DOING INTERVIEWS OVER THE PHONE RATHER THAN IN PERSON- BUT DEFINITELY THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENED THEN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR DAHLE SINI AND I LET ME THINK MY VICE CHAIRMAN FOR A- FORD. IN COURT JOB AND TO MY COLLEAGUES. WE ARE GOING TO GO TO- MEMBERS FIRST AND THEN MONEY LET ME START WITH YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN. JACK DAHLE SINI LET ME START BY BOTH CONGRATULATING YOU ON THIS APPOINTMENT BUT ALSO THANKING YOU FOR YOUR CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE YOU'VE SERVED CALIFORNIA AND YOU'VE SERVED OUR NATION IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHEN WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE I THINK MINDED. THE RIGHT TIME AND I THINK YOU'RE OVERVIEW ALSO CAPTURED THE MANY DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS IN DIFFERENT INTERESTS THAN IN TIMES OF EMOTIONAL IN THE MOMENT. BUT IN AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS. WE DID HAVE A GOOD PHONE CONVERSATION ONE AREA OF INTEREST YOU KNOW OF MINE AND I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE. THE WORK OF THE CLERK FOST WORKGROUP CHLORPYRIFOS. THE SITE AND IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE POTENTIAL NEUROTOXIC IMPAX. THE MOVEMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CANCEL ITS REGISTRATION BUT I KNOW THAT'S BEEN PART OF A PROCESS AND WOULD APPRECIATE. AND OF THE UPDATE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CHLORPYRIFOS WORKGROUP AND HOW THE PHASE OUT IS. NG THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW I REALLY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WHEN I CAME TO THE YOUR ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND- STILL. REGISTRATION AND BEGAN TO TAKE THE SECOND STEP WAS TO CHARTER A WORKGROUP WHICH WAS ASKED TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES TO CHLORPYRIFOS AS WE FACED THAT OUT. WORKGROUP MET THE NUMBER OF TIMES A THE COURSE OF LAST FALL AND A VERY ABBREVIATED PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH TO DO ITS WORK. BUT IT WAS A GREAT IN THE FIRST. STAKEHOLDER REPRESENTING IBM EXPERTS ACADEMICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS FARMWORKER HEALTH. REPRESENTATIVES PCA'S AND OTHERS WHO WERE REALLY ABLE TO HELP CRYSTALLIZE THE CONVERSATION AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO. THE WORLD BEYOND US. THE ULTIMATE REPORT WHICH WE ISSUED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IDENTIFIED SOME SYNTHETIC CHEMIST TREES THAT ACOSTA SIDES ESSENTIALLY. THAT COULD ACT AS ALTERNATIVES BUT ALSO A PESTICIDES. GROUP FURTHER ECOMMENDED THAT ADDITIONAL. BEING MADE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S IBM WORK I THINK THAT THAT'S ESSENTIAL AND FINALLY THE WORKGROUP COMMANDED THAT WE CHARTER A SECOND SUCCESSOR WORKGROUP TO LOOK AT THE BROADER SYSTEM WIDE ISSUES AROUND THE TRADE MISSION TO SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. AND SO WELL THE WORKGROUPS FOCUSED SMOKING IT OR PURIFY US AND WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM IT ALSO LOOKS MORE BROADLY. SINCE THE IS THAT WE CAN DO THE FOCUS ON CONSISTING OF A MANAGEMENT THE EFFORTS OF THAT SET WORK WILL BEGIN IN THE FALL AND IT WILL HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN. OR SO. DO ITS AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO DIGGING INTO THOSE ISSUES WHICH WILL RUN THE GAMUT FROM. IBM TO HEALTHY SOILS TO CLEAN AIR AND WATER TO BYSTANDER AND WORKER HEALTH. REALLY THE- ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF ISSUES THAT FACE US WHETHER YOUR FARMING OR WHETHER YOU'VE GOT A BACKYARD GARDEN THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MANAGING CUSTOMER. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN. RENTS TOP PM. THE PAST. AS WE JUST. IT'S A PART OF THE- VERNACULAR IF YOU IN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY EVERYONE A SUPPORTER OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT BUT IT DOES MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I THINK. FIFTEEN KIND OF TO THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF YOUR PORTFOLIO COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS ARE CHARGED WITH ENFORCEMENT OF OUR STATE PESTICIDE LAWS FEDERAL AND STATE IN SOME AREAS THE STATE HAS. LEGISLATED OR IMPLEMENTED. THE HIGHER STANDARDS IF YOU WILL ARE MORE STRICT STANDARDS THAN THE FEDERAL STANDARDS AND SO MY QUESTION GOES TO THAT AND FORCE MEANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR OFFICE AND THE COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS AND PARTICULARLY NOW WITH COVERT NINETEEN. AND SO MANY WORK IN IN FOR AGE. WERE FOR HOME THEIR OWN SAFETY AND HEALTH AND PROTECTION. HOW DOES THE ENFORCEMENT THE ROLE OF YOUR OFFICE AND OF COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS WITH FARMWORKERS CONSIDERED AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS CONTINUING TO WORK IN THE FIELDS WHILE OTHERS ARE MAY BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME. HOW DOES THE IN FORCE OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. MOVE FORWARD WITH BOTH SAFETY OF ENFORCEMENT WORKERS BUT ALSO SAFETY FOR FARMWORKERS PESTICIDE APPLICATORS OTHER AGRICULTURAL THIS. THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS SENATOR AND I'LL START BY SAYING THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT ABATED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. WE WENT. AND LIKE THE OTHER DIRECTORS BEFORE ME HAVE ARTICULATED WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST. DO OUR WORK AND FULFILL OUR MISSION BUT REALLY THE ENFORCEMENT WORK THAT WE DO WHETHER IT'S INSPECTING. PRODUCE AT WHOLESALE MARKETS FOR PESTICIDE RESIDUE OR GOING OUT TO INVESTIGATE PESTICIDE INCIDENTS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE USE. INSTANT HAVE HAVE CONTINUED. A FULL THROTTLE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AG COMMISSIONERS OF CALIFORNIA IS A VERY COMPLIMENTARY ONE. AND THE FACT IS THEY DO A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT WORK ON THE DEPARTMENT'S BEHALF IN THE FIELD AND EVERY COUNTY UP AND DOWN THE STATE FROM. OREGON TO THE MEXICAN BORDER AND SO THAT'LL WORK DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAS ALSO CONTINUES. OF QUITE ENERGETICALLY AND QUITE VIGOROUSLY WE HAVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS ISSUED SEVERAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS THAT. FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND AND I THINK THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE THE GREATEST RESPIRATORY HEALTH. CRISIS THAT THE WORLD IS IN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT COMMISSIONERS AS WELL AS DPR STAFF ANOTHER REGULAR. ONE MOST RESPONSE. ARE AND HOW VIDEO. THE RULES THAT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS HAVE AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT THE ENFORCEMENT WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HAS CONTINUED. WE REALLY HAVEN'T MISSED A BEAT IN THAT REGARD AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. WITH REGARD TO WORKER HEALTH WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO. PERIODICALLY SURVEY ARE AG COMMISSIONERS TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR P. P. ET. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS ARE IN A GIVEN COUNTY. AND TO ENSURE THAT GIVEN THE AG WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THAT THEY HAVE A PROPER ACCESS TO PPP WHETHER IT'S TIED BACK. SUITS FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATORS OR N. NINETY FIVE MASKS OR OTHER THINGS. FACE SHIELDS GOGGLES AND THE LIKE. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT MY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GOING OUT TO DO INSPECTIONS AND TO DO THEIR OWN ENFORCEMENT WORK HAVE ACCESS. TO THAT ALL ESSENTIAL PP AS WELL. BUT WE REALLY DON'T IN PARTNERSHIP AS DPR HAS FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES. WITH THE AG COMMISSIONERS ARE ARE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS. VERY SOLID AND I'M PLEASED THAT- YOU KNOW IN SUCH A WONDERFUL PARTNER FOR US. WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. MAKE THE CHIP. OTHER LEADERS TRANSITION RECENTLY AND SO BEEN. AND AGAIN OUT TO THE- AND MEETING WITH COMMISSIONERS WHAT I CAN AND- LEARNING FROM THEM DIRECTLY IN THEIR TEENS HOW WE CAN HELP AND HOW WE CAN. PROVIDE MORE ASSISTANCE TO THE ACT. BUT WE REALLY CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. THAT AND FOR WORK WHAT IS A REAL PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL IT SHOULD BE. KELLY P. A. AT THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT SO. REGULATORY PROGRAMS WITH REGARDS ASTROCYTE PROTECTIONS ARE ENFORCED AND ENFORCED VIGOROUSLY AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THEY ARE BEING. THANK YOU AND THEN MY- A LITTLE FURTHER ON THE ENFORCEMENT AS WE DISCUSSED THE AREA I REPRESENT. MONTEREY COUNTY SANTA CRUZ COUNTY THERE'S BEEN SOME INNOVATIVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY- AND THE AG COMMISSIONER IN AGRICULTURE SAFE SCHOOLS SAFE AG- THE MONTEREY COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER IN CANADA NOTIFICATION PROGRAM WENT BEYOND REQUIREMENTS OF THE REGULAR FILING OF THIS OF INTENT AND THEN AFTER THE APPLICATION I USE REPORT. WITH DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH SCHOOL PERSONNEL- TEACHER GROUPS REST FAMILIES LIVING NEAR SCHOOL SITES. TO BETTER COURTNEY NOTICE AND APPLICATION PERIOD SWIM SCHOOL SITES ARE VACANT AND ALSO IN ANTICIPATION OF CHILDREN COMING BACK TO THE SCHOOL SITES. JUST BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THAT PROGRAM AND COULD THAT BE A MODEL THAT COULD BE REPLICATED- IN OTHER COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER MONEY I THINKIT'S A GREAT PILOT PROGRAM YOU KNOW IT'S STILL JUST TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTRAGE THAT WE DO AROUND A PROGRAM LIKE THAT REACHES ALL OF THE FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IT SHOULD BUT I THINK THAT REPRESENTS. SOMETHING THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY BUILD UPON TO ESTABLISH A BROADER STATEWIDE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN FACT I'M ON MY WAY TO THE SENATE ALLEY LATER IN THE TO HAVE SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WITH. REST AND SEVEN YOUR REP AND OTHERS OUT THERE TO SEE IF WE COULD BEGIN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND WHAT NOTIFICATION COULD LOOK LIKE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT COME TO MY DE SINCE I'M- SORRY LAST FOURTEEN MONTHS OR SO AND IT'S REALLY WANT TO TRY. PEOPLE OTHER. HELLO TRUST COMES TO. ATIONS THAT AND I THINK THE OF WHAT'S IN THE VALLEY IS THAT YOU KNOW THE CAN HAS REALLY BEEN A TO BE A LOT OF DESPERATE TO GATHER. HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT NOTIFICATION COULD LOOK LIKE AND ONE OF THE CATION MAY LOOK LIKE- IN THE MORE STATEWIDE APPLICATION THANK YOU FOR THAT AND JUST MY FINAL COMMENT ON THAT I AGREE I THINK. SOFTEN RESISTANCE. SOME RESISTANCE OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT REGULATION CONTROLS AND YET. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIELD POSTING BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF CREW POISONINGS FROM DRAFT AND THEN CONSEQUENTLY REDUCTION IN LIABILITY IN SIMILARLY I THINK THIS NOTIFICATION PROGRAM IN THE PONDERA VALLEY. ALLENS VOLUNTARY- AS A MODEL. IT'S A WIN WIN FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF TRANSPARENCY SHARING OF INFORMATION AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS IN. ON NECESSARY UNWANTED EXPOSURES AND THAT LEADS TO LIMITED LIABILITY SO I HOPE. YOU WILL BE A CHAMPION OF THAT STATEWIDE IN AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THAT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU OF MADAM PROTEON WELCOME BACK THANK YOU- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT- DIRECTOR THE LITHUANIA AND JOBS GREAT GREAT BACKGROUND OF BIG JOB AHEAD BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA THAT HAVE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND AN UNDERSTATED PROBABLY. ABOUT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN FUNDED TO SEEK THE ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES THAT DO BECOME BANNED AND CERTAINLY- UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR FAMILY MEMBER A BELOVED FAMILY MEMBER- ON MANY YEARS AGO ACTUALLY HAPPENED TIMELY DOWN. DUE TO EXPOSURE OF PESTICIDE AT THAT TIME AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT WILL BAN MANY YEARS BUT. I THINK PHONE BILL IMPORT BUT I THINK OF WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THEM. WE HAVE TO CONTROL IN SO MORE DISEASE AND DOC SO IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT NEEDS BALLOTS CLEARLY AND I THINK THAT THAT. THE OUR RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM TO SEEK OUT THROUGH SCIENCE AND DATA FROM ALTERNATIVES OF A REALLY GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT COULD YOU UPDATE ON FOUND OUT IN AND- IS IT IS IT WORKING OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT TO. SENATOR THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR AMILY MEMBER- I THINK THAT IN MY TIME AT THE PR MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE THAT IT MINISTER OUR GRANTS PROGRAM HAVE BEEN VERY. YOU KNOW FRUITFUL FOR ME TO LEARN ABOUT THE SUCCESSES. OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE RUN FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. WE DO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS SOMETHING CALLED ALLIANCE. PROGRAM FOCUSES MORE ON. COMMUNITY BASED AND I SUPPOSE NON ACADEMIC EFFORTS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME ACADEMICIANS THAT APPLIED AND RECEIVED THOSE GRANTS. AND THEN THERE ARE OUR BASIC RESEARCH GRANTS WHICH WE- PROVIDE TO ACT MAKES MANY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR TO ALL. TO EGGMAN TO VETERANS. THE MORE APPROPRIATE WAYS TO CERTAIN HAS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND PESTICIDES IN OUR EVOLUTION FRANKLY FROM RELIANCE ON THE HARDER INDUSTRIES TO LOOKING FOR THE ALTERNATIVES THAT YOU MENTIONED PERHAPS THE GREENER PERHAPS THE SOFTER CHEMISTRIES INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT APPROACH IS THAT THE I THINK THAT WORK GROUP THAT I REFERENCED AT THE TOP OF MY REMARKS WILL WILL FULLY COVER. SO PART OF WHAT YEAR'S BUDGET ON THE ONE. APPROVAL OF THAT UP A SET AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO CORPORATE COST PACIFIC GRANT RELATED WORK AND CDFA HAD A PIECE OF THAT AS WELL AND- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THOSE GRANTS AND I THINK THAT. ALSO HELPS INDUSTRY WHICH HAD RELIED FOR MANY YEARS ON FOR YOUR OF US THE BROAD SPECTRUM PESTICIDE USED. ON ABOUT SIXTY DIFFERENT APPS FROM ALL. IT WAS EXPENSIVE IT WAS VERY FACT AND A RESULT IT WAS USED BY WIDELY. BUT WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WELL WE WERE GOING THIS PROCESS. PARKER FOSTER GRATION. THAT WE WEREN'T SIMPLY PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER. ARMORS ANOTHER COMMODITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE. OR PURIFY US BUT INSTEAD WE'RE PROVIDING SOME MONEY TO DO RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVES. YOU KNOW YOU MADE A GREAT POINT ABOUT THE OF. THE FACT THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE HERE. I THINK I FOUND SOME TOP JOBS IN MY TIME BUT BEING THE DIRECTOR OF EPR IS CERTAINLY. HIGH AMONG THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS. UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE DPR IS ALWAYS IN THE CROSS HAIRS FOR. ONE GROUP TO ANOTHER AND SO SEEKING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN. PROVIDING APPROPRIATE. CROP PROTECTION TOOLS TO THE THREE THAT SUPPORTS IT. AND ALL. THE COMPANY IN CORNIA AND ALSO TOWARDS THE FUTURE. A FEW MANY CAL WANT TO SHARE AND THAT'S USING SAY AND MORE SAYS. S. MANAGEMENT TOOL IS ALSO IN FOR AND THAT'S FINE LINE IS- YOU KNOW THE LINE THAT WE WALK AROUND HERE BUT I THINK WE DO IT SUCCESSFULLY. WOULD VERY AND VERY OFTEN AGING FINE NO IT'S ON THE IT'S A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE LIKE THE RODENTICIDES YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL. GET O MIRED IN DOUBT AND CERTAINLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT THERE'S A THREAT TO OUR- CERTAINLY HUMANKIND AND ANIMAL KIND AND- THAT THAT ONE'S GOING TO. YOU KNOW BE VERY EXCITING I THINK GOING FORWARD BUT I KNOW THAT IF WE'VE GOT THE FUNDS TO BE LOOKING FOR THOSE THINGS THAT WILL HELP US. YOU KNOW CONTROL. AND PROTECT IN TIME REALLY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND STEPPING INTO THIS EXTREMELY. IN FINANCE. MY SERVER. BUT TO VOTE THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOU SENATOR BATES VICE. THANK YOU ARE PRO. SERVICES SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME HE SAID EVERYBODY SUPPORTS IT GRATED PAST MANAGEMENT BUT IT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO IN THAT CONTEXT IN TERMS OF CROP PROTECTION AS A PROPERTY SHOULDN'T TOOL. WHAT THE STATE WILL MEAN TO YOU. WELL I THINK THAT EXISTENCE- PAST MANAGEMENT OR INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT AND TO MY MIND SENATOR WILL THE TWO ARE SOMEWHAT INTERCHANGEABLE TERMS MEANS THIS IT MEANS LESS OF A RELIANCE ON THE SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN THE GO TO FOR MOST LARGE SCALE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. EXAMPLE I TWO HIM TO A WINERY NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE LAST YEAR IN CENTER IN COUNTY THAT WILL PROFIT OF ARSENIC WASPS IT INTO THE VINEYARDS IN ORDER TO GO AFTER TESTS THERE NOW THEY COULD HAVE SPRAYED THE COULD HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE ON ANY NUMBER OF THINGS YOU WANT TO TRY SO. A LITTLE FRIEND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK UP ALL DIFFERENT TACK TO AVOID AN OVER RELIANCE ON THINGS LIKE WORKER FUSS AND OTHER HARDER CHEMICAL SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU INCORPORATE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO MANAGING PASSED AND I WOULD SAY THAT IN THE I. P. TOOL BOX THERE IS A PLACE FOR. SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES AND THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE BUT YOU CAN START WITH THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE QUITE THE POTENTIAL FOR. THREE TO EITHER. WELL PRICED. OR AND BY HEALTH GENERALLY. I THE CONTEXT OF BACKYARD GARDENER AND THAT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT. WORLD FOR DPR. WE'VE PRODUCED ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT I PM RESOURCES FOR BACKYARD GARDENERS TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE HOW. RELY LESS THINGS LIKE LIFE IS. SAMPLE PLANTING NATIVE SPECIES OR SIMPLY OUT WITH. A TRIAL AND DOING SOME HAND WEEDING THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN INCORPORATE IBM INTO THE WORK DO AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD OR ON THE BACK FORTY. AND IT'S GOING TO BE MY AGE. AS DIRECTOR OF. A LOT OF OTHER THINGS BUT I REALLY THINK OF IT AS THE- IN A PERHAPS THE BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT OF MY GOALS IS TO REALLY BOTH REDUCE RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. AND PROMOTE THIS CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT OR INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. AS A WAY TO HELP. CALIFORNIANS TRANSITION AWAY FROM. CHEMICALS AND MORE THANK THAT. BUT LIGHTER TOUCH. GREAT I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND I LOOK TO VOTING FOR YOUR NOMINATION WHEN SENATOR ROTH MAKES IT. THANK YOU SIR I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE COMPETITION HERE- SENATOR ROTH HUMANA PRO TEMS DIRECTOR CONGRATULATIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT TO INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OR PORTIONS OF IT AND- SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS- AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OF- FOR YEARS BEEN ENGAGED IN CITRUS FARMING AND- CITRUS MANAGEMENT NOW THEY'RE ALSO ENGAGED UP IN THE- CENTRAL VALLEY IS THAT INDUSTRY IS MIGRATED NORTH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OF COURSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND OF COURSE THEN I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID THIS WOMAN BEING. BUSY IN THE BILL IMPACT THAT THAT. THAT IT CAN HAVE ON OUR MAJOR CITRUS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE SINCE FLORIDA'S INDUSTRY AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAS BEEN. THEY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH AS A STATE AND WE'VE DEVOTED ENOUGH MONEY TO COMBATING THIS OF LONG LONG BEING. HLB DISEASE AND IF NOT WHAT CAN WE DO. US SENATOR WELL THAT'S A GREAT A PARDON ME CENTER RIGHT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD EVER DEVOTE ENOUGH MONEY TO THE KIND OF RESEARCH THAT WOULD ADDRESS. ACPYOU KNOW CITRUS IN CALIFORNIA'S A SEVEN OR EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IT'S REALLY AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE OVERALL HEALTH OF OUR AG ECONOMY AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE- ADDRESSING CITRUS GREENING AND DEVOTING THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO AND MY COLLEAGUES AT CDFA HAVE DONE REALLY FAR MORE WORK THAN. WE'VE DONE HERE EPR AROUND THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID IN THE BEST WAY TO CONTAIN IT. AND RESEARCH IS YOU KNOW STILL ONGOING I THINK THERE ARE SOME PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS A PARTICULARLY OUT OF UC RIVERSIDE AS YOU WELL KNOW RIGHT THERE ARE SOME PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS IN FLORIDA AND TEXAS AS WELL AND YOU KNOW THE STATE'S ALREADY. HAD THE RAVAGES OF THE CITRUS FOR THE IMPACT THEIR INDUSTRY BUT WE REALLY YOU KNOW GOT TO BE ON TOP OF THAT BEFORE IT GOES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REALLY IN. OF THE CITRUS BELT IN TULARE AND KERN AND FRESNO COUNTIES IN EARNEST AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SUPPORT LETTERS THAT I WAS THE PROUDEST RECEIVED WAS FROM CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND I WORK WITH CENTRIST USUALLY YEARS ON. YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW FIND THAT BALANCE THAT I MENTIONED TO THE SENATOR WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO WHEN THERE'S ALL THESE CONTINUING WORK- WITH.

BOTH TO ADDRESS SOME FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE PROGRESS BEING MADE- WITH THE DEATHS OF RACING HORSES AND HOW YOU. SEE THE VOICES OF THOSE MANY WHO ADVOCATE THIS IS A SPORT THAT SHOULD NOT BE. LICENSOR K. IS THERE AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF COURSE DEATHS- IN CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING AND EITHER ONE OF YOU COULD LEAD OFF ON THAT. I COULD QUESTION SENATOR ALL RIGHT I WANT TO FIRST SO THANK THE SENATORS FOR THE HARD WORK THAT WENT BEHIND SENATE BILL FOUR SIX NINE AM CENTER DODGE THANK YOU C. H. R. B. NEW POWER WITH.

I FEEL THAT- DR- FOR OUR WOULD WOULD ADEQUATELY STAGES ALL THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON ON MEDICATION- LIMITING THE COURT RECORD THEY'RE ALWAYS SO MAKING SURE AT LEAST SIX IS NOT IS NO LONGER FOR. YOUR OLD STARTED EARLIER THIS YEAR. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A VERY WATCH OF SMOKE OVER HORSES OF COURSE FOR YOUR OLD. OLDER WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE UNLESS THE DO A- MORNING WORKOUT IT'S- MERRY. WE ALSO BILL EMPOWER OVER TRACKS TO BUILD OFF OF RESTRICTIONS AROUND MANY. OF THE VICTORIOUS INJECTIONS USED- I BELIEVE OVER USED BOTH USE THE NEEDLES AND HORSES OPENING WILL BE ABOLISHED- BUT WE AT LEAST HAVE IT SO THAT HE CANNOT BE USE ON. THE ANKLE OF FORTY. INSTEAD OF BEEN MADE AT THE RACETRACKS LIKE SENATE ON HALF A MILLION DOLLAR CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS THAT WILL CREATE HIGH RESOLUTION DETECTION OF WELL BOUNCE IN BRUISES AN IMPOSSIBLE FRACTURES. FINALLY WE THINK THAT THE POSTMORTEM ANY CROPS USE UP COLLECTION THANK YOU FOR THAT. THAT WERE WAITING ANY FUTURE SITUATION. THAT TAKE LIVES BUT I JUST WANT TO LET.

THE FIVE JUDGE PANEL THAT THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S PANEL THAT LOOKS AT HORSES BEFORE THEY RACE. JACK PANEL. AS YOU THE PARSES THE TRAINING. AND FLAGGED ANY ISSUES I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO TAKE COURSES OUT RACES AND NOT LEAVE IT TO THE DECISION OF THE TRAINERS AND OWNERS I'M IN. STRONG FOR AS WELL. BUT AS I SAID WE NEED MORE REFORMS ARE NEEDED WE'VE MADE- SOME REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE TRACKS AND IMPLEMENT THOSE EVEN. RIGHT ACROSS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S MORE IT'S ABOUT A STATEMENT THAT'S COMING FROM THE BOARD FROM THE COMMISSION SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE THIS WHERE FOCUS. AND WE WILL. CLEAR WE'RE WE'RE MOVING ACTION AND EVERYONE'S AND SO WHAT IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT WE'VE MADE WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS. THANK YOU BOTH AND THEN IF JUST A FINAL QUESTION- AND IT CAME UP IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND WAS MENTIONED BY MISS MITCHELL IN HER OPENING- THIS IS BEEN A PREDOMINATELY- A MALE DOMINATED.

OF ACTUALLY POSITION WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM A CALL FROM NINE TO ELEVEN. I WAS REQUIRING THEM TO FEEL THOUGH. THAT WITH WOMEN LEADERS. I BELIEVE THAT THE INDUSTRIES ALL THIS IS THE THIRD PERSON BE QUITE HONEST WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO BACK WHEN I GREW UP ON. THE PRESSURE MANY MANY MORE. LEADERSHIP'S THAT ALL THE- EXERCISE RIDERS TEND TO BE. BLACK BELIEVES WITH. SOFTER MORE J. CAN BE MUCH LIGHTER UP. I BELIEVE MAKE EXCELLENT- THANKS AN EXERCISE RIDER WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE.

THE NEXT COMMISSIONER IS A WOMAN. WHO CAN JOIN US IN OUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MITCHELL YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE NO BETTER ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRY THAT OSCAR REALLY HE'S BEEN AMAZING AND BEEN- VOCAL ABOUT THIS ABOUT SUPPORTING WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRY I TALKED ABOUT THE WAR THAT CAME BEFORE. I YEAH TALK ABOUT SENATOR MINE ON THE PHONE- EASILY SEE. STAFF IS LIMITED BUT WE ARE DOING SOME SORT OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY AND THEN TALKING TO YOU YOU KNOW TRACKS AND TRAINERS AND OWNERS WHEN THEIR LICENSE CAN BE FOR US TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT DIVERSITY AS WELL SO WE CAN GOALS YOU KNOW FROM THE BULLY PULPIT AT BUT ALSO WITH OUR STAFF. I HAVE TO SAY THAT ON. THE RECORDING WOULD THAT WORK ON THE TEACHER YEAH AND THEY DO A BANG UP JOB SELFISH. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET ANOTHER WOMAN.

IMPRESSIVE OF PUBLIC SERVICE- HERE IN THE CAPITOL IN WASHINGTON IN THE NONPROFIT ARENA. ON MANY FRONTS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CAREERS OF DEDICATION AND SERVICE MADAM PRO TEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR AND THE- WE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET- DR FERRARO IN DEL MAR AND TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRACK GIVE IT AFTER SOME OF THE CONCERNS WERE RAISED. MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. AND THIS PROCESS. IS TO CUT TRACK. OF COURSE ISN'T THE HEAD FROM YOU KNOW WHERE THE START AND GET ON TRACK BEFORE THE RACE SEE THE- THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE. AND BRILLIANT WITH HIS ARM. EIGHT YOU KNOW I ASK A LOT OF FOLLOWS THE THIS AN OPPORTUNE YOU PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE LOOK AS WELL AND I APPRECIATE- OF THE- COMMISSIONER. AGAIN UP BEFORE SIXTY NINE SENATOR. AND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE REFORMS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD AS IT RELATES TO THE RIDING CROP IN THE REVIEW OF FORCES FITNESS BEFORE EACH RACE ALL OF THOSE. THOSE ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF- ARM. YOU KNOW THIS INDUSTRY AND WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH RIGHT NOW AND THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT. ABOUT THE DEATHS OF HORSES. NEW YORK CALIFORNIA- KENTUCKY OF COURSE FLORIDA WHERE DO WE RANK I MEAN HOW DO YOU BALANCE. BUT THE REGULATIONS AND REFORMS WE ARE DOING IN CALIFORNIA WITH WHAT OTHER STATES DO AND THE IMPACT THAT COULD HAVE ON US- ECONOMICALLY COURSE THEY WILL CONTINUE. TO PARTICIPATE IN AND HORSE RACING I'M JUST INTERESTED IT'S ART YOU DEAL WITH THIS I'M EVERY DAY. I'M IN. SENATE INSIDE YOUR FACE SCREEN MAYBE YOU CAN START THIS TIME AND THEN WE'LL GO TO MR GONZALEZ I'D APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS. SURE I THINK. AS FAR AS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO THE INDUSTRY- IN CALIFORNIA IS FAR AHEAD OF THE REST OF STATESAS FAR AS REFORM AND I BELIEVE YOU KNOW SUPPOSE CALIFORNIA SO GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I THINK CALIFORNIA IS IN BETTER SHAPE REGARDLESS YOU SAFETY THAN OTHERS- BUT THERE'S MORE THAT BE. I DON'T THINK THAT ANY THE- REFORM. WAIT NEGATIVE IMPACT THE TRACKS TO DO RACES YEAR FAMILIAR SURE EXACTLY- JUST DELMAR AS AN INCREDIBLE FACILITY THAT HAS AMAZING RACES AND- AT WORST IS A AND PEOPLE WANT TO RAISE. ARE REFORMS- YOU KNOW ARE REALLY ON THE BACK AND ON THE- AMOUNT AS- MEDICINE THAT CAN BE INJECTED INTO HORSES AND. AND YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT THE HORSE'S TRAINING RECORDS HIS CENTER IN ADVANCE OF THEM BEING ABLE TO RACE SO I MEAN OUR PARENTS ARE YOU KNOW PROCESS YOU'D BE THE REGULATORY PROCESS TAKES TIME- I BELIEVE THAT YOU DON'T WANT EVERYONE. RULES AND IS THE RULES ARE YEAH. INSISTENTLY FOLLOWED THAT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ECONOMICS OF THE HORSERACING I BELIEVE THAT- PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE FIRST REYES AND THEY WANT TO SEE OUR- A- THE WHOLE PROCESS AND- YEAR HOW THE VIRUSES ARE TREATED AND- ADRIAN THE ANIMALS AND SO I THINK IT ULTIMATELY BENEFITED ANY ANY REFORM. IT IS TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND FOR PEOPLE TO COME ON BOARD BUT ONCE EVERYONE'S YOU KNOW THE RULES ARE CONSISTENT EVERY. MR GONZALEZ. MY OPINION ON ON THAT SUBJECT OF BOILS DOWN TO COMPETITION SINCE COMPETITION HE QUALITY SOUND HORSES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A- COMPETITION BETWEEN US AND OTHER STATES TO KEEP TRAINERS AND OWNERS AND JOCKEYS. IT ARE CALIFORNIA THE WAY I BELIEVE WE SOME OF THE BEST CLIMATE FOR RACING. WE HAVE THE ARGOSY LEAST. WE HAVE OF POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS I BELIEVE THAT EXERCISE FLEXIBILITY- WHEN NECESSARY BUT STICK TO THE TO THE RULE OF LAW CALIFORNIA. SOME IS SOMEBODY WOULD JUST ENJOY IT COMES TO THE PURSE STRUCTURE THAT IS THE AMOUNT IS OF THE TO THE COMPETITORS OF EACH RACE OTHER STATES HAVE CASINOS AND SOLD NO REVENUE TENDS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT THEY COMPETE FOR SHIPPING OR CROSS COUNTRY THAT EXPENSE ANYMORE BUT WE ARE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH SONORA MISTER. YOUR STATUS SO WE- PERHAPS A EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT IF YOU WILL BUT THAT CALIFORNIA IS. IT IS BREEDERS PROGRAM I JUST DISCUSSED IN MY OPENING REMARKS HOW POOR READERS ARE. THREE THE PLUS YOU KNOW. WILSHIRE OR ARE ARE BORN EACH YEAR WITH EVERY FULL YOU HAVE ECONOMIES FROM VETERINARIANS TO FEED CARETAKERS TAX EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE SEE OUR LITTLE MICRO ECONOMIES ARE BUILT AROUND THE SMALL FARMS AND WHEN YOU ADD IN YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO WITH A BRAND NEW HORSES ACT INCREASE BOTH. AND HELP CREATE JOBS AND HELPS REVENUE. SB IN OCTOBER WHEN WE ABLE THE NEW RIDING CROP RULE OUT. IT IS GOING TO BE THE DISTRICT THIS ROLE- THAT WILL ONLY ALLOW JOCKEYS TO USE IT IN A DOWNWARD MOTION SIX TIMES MAXIMUM WITH THE PAUSE IN BETWEEN. IT IS BY FAR THE MOST RESTRICTIVE. OF WAR IN WAR. THIS IS SOMETHING. IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE. YOU US STATES TO COME UP WITH THE NATIONAL STANDARD BECAUSE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN WE WENT AHEAD AND WE IMPLEMENTED THIS VERY STRICTER USE OF THE WRITING SURE THE JOCKEYS THAT WE WILL WILL TAKE VERY UP CLOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. USING IN JEOPARDY BUT I DOUBT VERY SERIOUSLY ORGANIS E. INTO LEADING BECAUSE WE'VE LED THE WAY ON ON UNINITIALIZED RIDING CROP SO I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE WAY BECAUSE CALPERS. ARE CURRENTLY STASHED AT. IS THE BEST. I THANK YOU ANNA AND I'M SO OF REFER AND IMPLEMENTATION I THINK IN TERMS OF OUR LEGISLATION AND PRESENTED. THEY GIVES YOU MORE POWER AS THE BOARD- THE QUESTION IS EXERCISING THAT POWER AND WHERE THE BALANCE IS TO PUSH. UP FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF THAT LAND TOWARDS LESS DEATHS OF HORSES I GUESS IF THE ONLY AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION THAT CAN BE HAD THERE- IN TERMS OF THE RACING SURFACES FOR EXAMPLE LET ME JUST TAKE SANTA ANITA. SHOULD THAT SURFACE BE RIVER HOW DO YOU I AND I WATCHED ALLOF THE MONITORING THAT TEST AND THUS AND SUCH I DON'T THE GENERAL PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS HOW MUCH GOES INTO WHAT YOU OF HOW YOU WAIT. TO DETERMINE THE SAFETY OF A- DO YOU HAVE FOR. I ORDERED. ACTUALLY WEIGH IN ON THINGS LIKE WHETHER A SURFACE SHOULD BE REPLACED OR NOT- THAT MIGHT BE A QUICK SIMPLE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW BUT MISTER GONZALES YOU WANNA SEE YOU YES WE HAVE. BEEN THAT WAY AND- IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST- THE IN THE ATLAS ANALYST DESCRIPTION REPORT THAT THERE'S AN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED WHAT THE DOCTOR PETERSON WHO- RANK IN ORDER OF SEQUENCE THAT SIR AT THE TOP TOUR. AND. EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE- WE BELIEVE THAT THE RACE TRACKS ARE TAKEN. OUT IS SUB MATTER VERY SERIOUSLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPER INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. THE FACT IS THE CLOTHES ON THE LAST FUTURE MEETING WANTED TO- INSTITUTE. A MONTHLY CONVERSE MONKS THE RACETRACK SUPERINTEND OF AND OTHER OF A RACE TRACK IN TENNESSEE TRAINING FACILITIES DISCUSS BEST PRACTICES. OF DIFFERENT USES OF SOIL OF. IN ONE SERVICED ANOTHER ALSO SHARE IT ABOUT THE CITY QUITMAN WATER TRUCKS TO TRACTORS I JUST BELIEVE THAT IS A VERY PROFESSIONAL LIVES INDUSTRY IT IS CRITICAL THAT BECAUSE HORSES ARE SO DELICATE. WHAT THE RUN ON. WE PROTECT AND WHEN YOU ADD IN A DRY WEATHER WET WEATHER SOMETIMES WITHIN A MONTH'S TIME THAT CAN. DISRUPT THAT THIS SERVICE SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO BE PAID BUT YES SHOULD THERE BE THE OF. THE USE OF THE COURT WITHIN THE CRB- TO. MANDATE THAT RETRACT CHANGE YOUR SURPLUS AB. THAT'S THE WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY. LET IT BEFORE MS MITCHELL RESPONSE LET ME JUST ASK DO YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY YOU NEED ART RIGHT NOW ABLE TO MAKE SOME PRETTY SERIOUS CALLS SHOULD YOU NEED TO OR IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD NEED OF US TO BE ABLE TO- TO DO THAT AND- SORRY I JUST THOUGHT PROJECT THAT. YOU HAVE WELL AS YOU DO THAT IBM. THING ELSE. IN A WORD YES OKAY STUDY UP ON THIS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY WE NEED ONE COMES TO. THE SERVICE OKAY. MISS MITCHELL I'M I'M JUST I AM A FAN OF THE SYNTHETIC OF TRACKS I THINK THAT IS THE DIRECTION THATWE NEED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT AND BE HONEST SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE BOARD WE HAVEN'T REALLY TAKEN A SERIOUS LOOK PREVIOUS OR- AND HE- DID. SYNTHETIC TRACKS AND THERE WERE MIXED RESULTS AND SO EVERYONE POINTS TO THAT IS THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER. BUT I THINK THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY AND NOT SUBSIDIARIES DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. AS FAR AS THE WORDINGI'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WINNER RESTORING USE WITH REGARD TO MANDATE IN THE TRACKS THAT. IN GIVING THEM THEIR LICENSE WE SAY THAT YOU KNOW. HAVE A SYNTHETIC TRACK. HAVING SAID THAT HERE ARE FOUR SIX UNITED DODD BILL ALLOWS US TO CLOSE DOWN TRACKS IF THERE IS AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF COURSE YES. WE AREEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RECENTLY CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE BOARD UNDER THAT NEW LEGISLATION- BECAUSE OF THE DEFICITS LOS ALAMEDA WAS AND- ICE. AT THE HEARING AND SAID I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT. YOU KNOW EIGHTY STRONGER. SIXTY PRISON IT WAS MORE OF REASON FROM OUR LAWYERS AND FACT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO VOTED- THAT THE TAX SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN IN ORDER FOR THEM TO PLAY. IN SOME SAFETY PROTOCOLS- I WAS I LOST THAT VOTE. WILL END UP HAPPENING WAS THEY WENT BACK AND DID AND- I TEND TO COME UP WITH THE STATE PROTOCOL. AND WE- ASK THE BORDER SUPPORTED THAT LATER AND- THUS FAR YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE OVERALL HAVE THAT'S THAT'S WORKING. AND AS IT WOULD NICE TALK TO CENTER MONNING LAST WEEK I SAID YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR OUR ROLE IN OUR ABILITY IS SHE TO. SUPPORT THE TRACK OWNERSHIP TO SAY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THIS SO THAT THEY CAN THANK CRAP ON TRAINERS AND- ON THEIR TRACKING ORDER TO ENSURE HER SAFETY SO WE'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US FOR SAFETY I THINK HAVING THAT HEARING ALSO NEED US WAS. SAID SHE EVERYONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO THIS IS YOU. EXCESSIVE FORCE YES WE GOING TO HOLD THESE EMERGENCY MEETINGS HOLD YOUR FEET TO THE FIRE AND EXPECTS CHANGE. Q. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I WOULD JUST SAY ARE YOU GIVEN I HAVE DEL MAR IN MY DISTRICT I PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION. LIKE MOST PEOPLE I LOVE HORSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED SO MR GONZALEZ THANK YOU FOR YOUR- FOR ADVOCATES I'M ON BEHALF OF. EVERYONE AND EVERY PART OF WHAT MAKES OUR- WERE FACING WORK PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WORK THE HARDEST AND PROBABLY. PAID THE ELITE. I OF YOU TO EXERT YOUR FULL AUTHORITY BECAUSE I THANK YOU MORE THAN ANYBODY KNOW YOUR CHARGE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FACT THAT IF IT IS NOT BALANCED APPROPRIATELY WE WILL LOSE SINGING CALIFORNIA PEOPLE DO NOT SEE. L. HORSE. THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE WORKERS WHO ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT IT AND TAKING CARE OF WHETHER IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC OR JUST GENERALLY SO I APPLAUD YOU BOTH AND URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO BE. ACTIVES FORWARD MS MITCHELL AS I KNOW YOU ARE. I KNOW YOU PERSONALLY- WHICH IS WHY I SAY THAT. BUT I JUST THINK WE IF WE DON'T DO IT APPROPRIATELY WE STAND TO LOSE EVERYTHING- AND IF IT COMES DOWN TO LOSING EVERYTHING- PROTECTING CORPSES. I THINK THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF PROTECTING HORSES NO MATTER HOW MUCH. WE ENJOYED DEL MAR ARE LOS ALAMEDA SERVER I ANY ANY.
