WELCOME THANK YOU ARE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LET THE SERVE OSCARS WILSON I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. I'M A FORMER MAYOR AS CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND FORMER LEGISLATIVE STAFFER TO THE LATE HONORABLE MARVIN TIMELY AND AN EDUCATOR IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. ARE WE ARE NOT HERE TODAY BECAUSE CENTRAL BASIN IS DELIVERING DIRTY WATER WE'RE NOT HERE TO DAY BECAUSE CENTRAL BASIN HAS STOPPED DELIVERING. A WATER TO OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE IT SERVES AND WE'RE ALSO NOT HERE TO DATE BECAUSE THERE IS ANY MISSING OR STOWING MONEY AT CENTRAL BASIN. WERE HERE TODAY BECAUSE A SMALL GROUP OF PRIVATE INTERESTS WANT TO TAKE OVER OUR COMMUNITIES WATER SYSTEM IT'S ALMOST. ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS. THIS WELL ACTED IN OUR THIS IS ON MY REPRESENTATION AND I URGE YOU TO SAY NO TO SB SIX TWENTY FIVE. THE FACTS ARE CENTRAL BASIN IS SOLVENT. CENTRAL BASINS BONDS ARE IN GOOD STANDING. CENTRAL BASINS BILLS ALL PAID. THIS BILL IS FILLED WITH SO MANY MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE CENTRAL BASIN THAT I'VE SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD AND I BELIEVE EACH OF YOU HAVE A PACKET. OUR LET ME GO THROUGH SOME OF THOSE MISREPRESENTATIONS FIRST THE BILL ANALYSIS SITES THAT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS THE GROUP HAS- ENDORSED THIS MEASURE IT HASN'T THE BOARD HAS NEVER PASSED A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THE SOUTHEAST WATER COALITION ALSO HAS NEVER VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THIS CITIES OF DOWNEY AND LAKE WOULD HAVE NOT. VOTED ARE TO PASS A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THE CENTRAL BASIN WATER ASSOCIATION ALSO HAS NOT VOTED AS A GROUP TO HAVE A SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND NEITHER HAS THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL AND ITS ANALYSIS MAKES NUMEROUS REFERENCES TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STATE AUDIT BUT IT ALSO FAILS TO MENTION THAT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INSTITUTED. IT ALSO FAILED TO TELL YOU THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE AUDIT FINDINGS ARE NO LONGER ON THE BOARD WE'VE HAD FIVE ELECTIONS AFTER THAT AUDIT AND WE HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOARD THIRTY SECONDS PLEASE THE PLAIN AND SIMPLE TRUTH HERE IS THAT THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT TO DISENFRANCHISE OUR COMMUNITIES OF COPPER. BY ELIMINATING ITS ELECTED BY LEE BODY SITE SEEING OVER TWENTY TWO MILLION CITIZENS TO REPRESENT OUR WHO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY AND IS AN EFFORT BY A SMALL PRIVATE GROUP. OF INTERESTED WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE TEN IS TO TAKE. AND PRIVATIZE OUR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM IT WAS DONE AT CITY THE WATER DISTRICT UNFORTUNATELY. WHAT'S BEING DONE AT CENTRAL BASIN AND I URGE YOUR NO SUPPORT ON SB SIX TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS GREAT THANK YOU MUCH. I WILL NOT HAVE IT THEY WILL PAVE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON DOUG GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AT THE NEW WILL BE ON BEHALF OF THE DIRECTORS OF CENTRAL BASIN. I JUST WANNA DRESSED THE THINGS THAT ARE RAISED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE FIRST THING IS THAT CENTRAL BASES IN DISARRAY. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO FAXES SUPPORTED DISARRAY. ARE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS AND ONE OF THEM IS TO BE HEARD JULY TWENTY THIRD BY THE COURT AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE AN END RUN AROUND THE COURT'S DECISION ON A CRITICAL ISSUE. THE SECOND POINT REYES OF IN SUPPORT OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT FOR MEMBERS TOOK OVER THE DISTRICT. THE FOUR MEMBERS OF NEVER TOOK OVER THE DISTRICT ON JANUARY THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR THERE WAS A REORGANIZATION. AND THE VOTE WAS FOR THREE TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT THOUGH FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF CENTRAL BASIN. THE OLD JUN. PARTIES TO THIS MATTER DISAGREED WITH THAT AND REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REORGANIZATION. THERE'S NO THREAT TO THE WATER SUPPLY. THERE'S A ISSUE IN HERE THAT IS A THREAT TO WATER SUPPLY IS ABSOLUTELY NO THREAT TO WATER SUPPLY THERE HAS BEEN A MISSED DELIVERY WATER IS BEEN PROVIDED TO EACH AND EVERY CONSTITUENTS. THE FOUR THING. THE IN THEIR ANALYSIS THEY SHOULD THE SITE HUNTINGTON PARK VERSES THE SCHOOL E. WHO JUST CALLED IN PREVIOUSLY AND IS THAT APPOINTED MEMBER. HE CREATED A SITUATION THAT CALLS LITIGATION BE FILED BY LAUNCHING PARK NAMING HIM. THE REASON WHY THEY NAMED HIM IS THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH MISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S PREVIOUS BILL WITH THESE APPOINTED MEMBERS THE GENERAL MANAGER WAS DESIGNATED WOULD OPENING BALLOTS WHEN YOU OPEN HUNTINGTON PARKS BALLOT HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T LIKE CLINTON PARKS APPOINTEE AND DISMISSED TOM AND THEREFORE HUNTINGTON PARK FILED A LAWSUIT IT WASN'T GOOD CENTRAL BASIN. WAS AGAINST DIRECTED WAS COOLEY WHO IS AN APPOINTEE AND THAT CASES CITED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. AS TO THE ISSUES YES THERE IS A- THE ISSUE FOR JANUARY- JULY TWENTY THIRD ISSUES WHETHER NOT THE REORGANIZATION ON JANUARY THIRTIETH WAS PROPER. AND THAT'S A LEGAL ISSUE BUT IN ORDER TO SKATE. OR SKIRT TO LEGAL ISSUE THE PARTIES ARE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A AND RUN WITH THISCOMMITTEE. AND TO HAVE YOU DRAFT AN EMERGENCY BILL FOR WHICH THERE IS NO EMERGENCY. THERE IS NOTHING- PREVENT IN THE PARTY FROM WAITING A TO JOT JULY TWENTY THIRD TO HEAR THE COURT'S DECISION. THIRTY SECONDS PLACE. I SUBMIT TO THIS BILL- AUGUST BODY THAT. WHAT YOU'RE CHARGED WITH IS MAKING SURE THAT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES WITHIN THE STATE FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY SENT TO.
