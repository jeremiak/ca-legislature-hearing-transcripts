MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB. THIRTY TO TODAY AB THIRTY TWO PROHIBITS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION FOR ME NEWMAN OR ENTERING INTO. A CONTRACT WITH A FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISON FACILITY BEGINNING ON JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY AND WILL COMPLETELY PHASE OUT THEIR USE BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT SB THIRTY TWO WAS RECENTLY AMENDED. TO EXPAND THAT BAN TO THE USE OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES GENERALLY. THIS INCLUDES THOSE FOR FOR PROFIT DETENTION FACILITIES. THAT HOUSE IMMIGRANT SUBJECT TO CIVIL ATTENTION AS WELL AS OTHER POPULATIONS THE REALITY IS THAT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS. AS A FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY. TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AS A RESULT. MAXIMIZING PROFITS OFTEN COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF DISINVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIANS. IN MY VIEW OF THE THIS FIDUCIARY DUTY IS IN CONFLICT WITH INVESTMENT IN REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE. THE REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM RATES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. IT ALSO CONFLICTS WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE WELFARE AND WELL BEING. OF OUR REIDENTS FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED. WITH DOCUMENTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES INCLUDING INADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE AND ACCESS AT THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY IN THE FACE OF SHAMEFUL ABUSES WE NEED TO TAKE STRONG ACTION. TO DEFEND OUR VALUES OF RACIAL JUSTICE ND COMMON HUMANITY. IT'S CLEAR THE GOALS OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO SUCCEED. IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE GOALS OF THESE CORPORATIONS TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE LOCKING UP CALIFORNIANS. CONTRACTING WITH FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS WAS IT I WAS ORIGINALLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE PROBLEM OF INMATE OVERCROWDING. TO COMPLY WITH A FEDERAL COURT ORDER TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF DESIGN CAPACITY. AD TO AVOID THE EARLY RELEASE OF INMATES AS A RESULT OF VOTER INITIATIVES LIKE PROP 47-57. THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE INMATE POPULATION THAT ALLOWS FOR THE TRANSFER OF INMATES FROM PRIVATE. TO PUBLIC FACILITIES AS OF MAY TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA'S IT MAY POP POPULATION WAS AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR POINT 8% OF DESIGN CAPACITY WHICH FALLS UNDER. THE COURT ORDERED POPULATION CAP NOW THAT WERE UNDER THE CAP. AND SEEN A DOWNWARD TREND IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO ESTABLISH A SENSIBLE TIME LINE TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS. AB THIRTY TWO WILL BEGIN TO RE DIRECT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO INVEST IN AND PRIORITIZE EFFECTIVELY ABILITY THE BILL TATIAN PROGRAMS. WHICH WILL MINIMIZE RECIDIVISM RATES AND MAXIMIZE SUCCESS. FOR INMATES UPON THE RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY. AND IT WILL HELP ENSURE SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH A. B. THIRTY TWO WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT. TO ITS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO STATE PRISONS BUT SHOULD EXTEND TO PROTECT EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO IS IN THE CUSTODY OF A CORPORATION RUNNING A FOR PROFIT DETENTION FACILITY. WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE AND INVEST IN THEIR SUCCESS AB THIRTY TWO AS AMENDED SET US DOWN THAT PATH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TWO IS PROFESSOR BILL HANG. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW AS WELL AS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION CO SPONSOR OF AB. THIRTY TWO GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD THANK YOU CHAIR OF AYE AYE AYE WIDER THAT I AM PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO AND AND EMERITUS AT UC DAVIS WERE I TAUGHT. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND IMMIGRATION. LAW ALSO I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION THAT I'M ALSO POOR THE FLOORS INSPECTION TEAM THAT IS INSPECTED SITES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND MOST RECENTLY I WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT INSPECTED AND HIS EXPOSE WHAT'S GOING ON AND CLINT -- WORLDS AT TWO WEEKS AGO. I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL CHALLENGE TO A. B.. THIRTY TWO AND UNDER THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE THE WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT A CHALLENGE ON THE BASIS OF PRE EMPTION AND THE BASES OF THE INNER GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES CLAUSE. IN MY OPINION A. B. THIRTY TWO WITH WOULD WITHSTAND THOSE CHALLENGES. PREEMPTION. WOULD NOT HOLD BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO REGULATE IMMIGRANTS WHO CAN BE DEPORTED WHO WHO CAN BE ADMITTED. SO IT'S NOT A FEEL PREVENTION PROBLEM THERE'S NO CONFLICT IT DOESN'T BAR ICE FROM HAVING ITS OWN FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO THERE'S NOT BEEN AN EXPRESSION BY CONGRESS IN THE END AND THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. THAT THE DEFINITELY SAYS THAT THEY MUST HAVE PRIVATE PRISON PARTNERS IN ORDER TO DO ITS WORK SO THERE'S NOT AN EXPRESSION THAT WOULD YOU WOULD BE A PROBLEM. INTER GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES DOCTRINE IS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION DOES THIS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS CLEARLY NO IT THIS IS ABOUT REGULATING PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES. AND YES IT WILL AFFECT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF ICE ATTENTION BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS THIS STATE AUTHORITIES AS WELL SO BECAUSE IT EVEN HANDEDLY AFFECTS BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ACTORS IN MY VIEW THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE INTERN AND RETENTION GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY STOCKTON AND FINALLY THERE'S A CONTRACT CLAUSE POTENTIAL WHICH IS VERY. IT WEEK IF RAISED -- THE STATE CANNOT INTERFERE WITH CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ACTORS AND THERE'S A PROVISION IN SB THIRTY TO THE SPECIFICALLY SAYS. ANY EXISTING CONTRACT IS NOT INTERFERED WITH AND IS ALLOWED TO AND AT ITS DURATION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. THE MANAGER MEMBERS RANCHER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION -- PRO CO SPONSORS OF AB -- THIRTY TWO PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS ARE ANATHEMA TO CALIFORNIA VALUES ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ALMOST DAILY NEWS ACCOUNTS OF THE HORSE WITHIN THESE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT. FACILITIES AND ON A PERSONAL NOTE I'D LIKE TO SEND PRECISION TO YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR CONSISTENT CONCERN ABOUT AN ADVOCACY IN OPPOSITION.

A. B. TWELVE POINT TWO BY FORMER CENTER. SHE LOOKED YOU'LL. THE BILL SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED BY LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW. SB THIRTY TWO WILL END THE RENEWAL OF CONTRACTS FOR FOR PROFIT PRISONS. AND DETENTION FACILITIES BY PHASING OUT THERE USE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. SB THIRTY TWO WILL ALSO HELP RE DIRECT ARE JUST SYSTEM THE VALUE IN PRIORITIZE EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHICH WILL IDEALLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS FOR INMATES UPON THE RE ENTRY TO SOCIETY. JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. INCARCERATION IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AS INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANY TYPE OF PRIVATIZATION THE COURTS CORRECTIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT. CANCEL THE TENSION IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO LOCK UP PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF SHOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED AND NOT HAVE THE FUNCTION DELEGATED TO THE LOWEST COMPETITIVE BETTER. WE MUST ASK OURSELVES WHO SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF INCARCERATING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OR MAKE PRISONS INCORPORATED. OR THE YOU UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. OR ACNE CIVIL DETENTION LLC. FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS DETENTION CORPORATIONS OPERATE SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED AND IN HUMANE INCARCERATION FACILITIES IN OUR NATION. ASSAULTS ON STAFF AND ON THE CAR SERRATED A CURRENT RATES 40% HIGHER. THAN A CURRENT PUBLIC FACILITIES THESE COMPANIES HAVE POR SCREENING EXTREMELY LAX HIRING STANDARDS RESULTING IN REPEATEDLY HIRING CONVICTED FELONS INCLUDING SEX OFFENDERS.

THANK YOU SIR. ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. IS THE OPPOSITION OUTSIDE OR LET'S GIVE HIM A MOMENT TO COME IN. THE AT WITH ALL THAT SUPPORT THEY MIGHT BE WELL OFF STAYING OUTSIDE BUT WILL LET HIM COME ON IN. HERE IS A ONE BRAVE MAN IN A WHITE SUIT WHICH MAKES IT EVEN BRAVER -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER Y. CASKEY BUT LET'S SAY HERE THE OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES PLEASE.% AFTER MANAGER MEMBERS COURCELLES OVER HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OUR CONCERN IS NOT ABOUT PRIVATE PRISONS ARE THE PROPRIETY OF THE USE THEREOF -- OUR ISSUE IS THAT THERE ARE SORT OF LIMITED OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO INCARCERATING OR DEALING WITH OFFENDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. AND THE THE FEAR WE HAVE IS THAT. BY TAKING A TOOL BOX OR TAKING TWO OUT OF THE TOOL BOX. THE PRISON SYSTEM WILL BE LEFT WITH FEW OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO CROWDING. THE STATISTICS WE'VE HEARD THE THE BUFFER AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED INMATES MEANING. THAT IF THE POPULATION OF THE PRISON SYSTEM INCREASES BY ABOUT. ONE TO ONE POINT 2% WE WILL BE AT THE FEDERALLY MANDATED CAP. WHICH MEANS INMATES GET RELEASED SHARES HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT INMATES GETTING RELEASED AND NOT HAVING THAT TOOL TO HELP MANAGE POPULATION AT THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM. OUR SECONDARY AND OTHER CONCERN IS THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS OF REALIGNMENT ON COUNTY JAILS -- AND THIS IS NOT A COMPLAIN ABOUT REALIGNMENT CERTAINLY A BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS HAVE HAVE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE -- ON USE JAIL BEDS CURRENTLY AROUND THE STATE AND THAT THAT -- SHOULD BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HOUSING FOLKS WHO WOULD MIGHT OTHERWISE BE HOUSED IN A PRIVATE PRISON. INSURES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF THAT BECOMES A REALITY THAT -- THAT WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON THE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM -- WITHOUT RESOURCES LIKELY -- AND WILL EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE ALREADY FACE IN COUNTY JAILS WHO ARE HOUSING OFFENDERS -- WHO USED TO SERVE SIXTY OR -- NINETY HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SURF HEY HOUSING THEM FOR THREE FIVE TEN YEARS AT A TIME BECAUSEOF REALIGNMENT AND SO AGAIN BECAUSE OF THOSE CONCERNS NOT A STORY ABOUT PRIVATE PRISONS GOOD PRIVATE PRISONS BAD. BY TAKING A TWO OUT OF THE TOOL BOX AND INCREASING PRESSURE ON COUNTY -- RESOURCES THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN OVER THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING AND HEARING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME I GOT IT I HAVE I THINK HISTORICALLY BEEN OPPOSED TO THE NOTION OF A PRIVATE PRISON. PRISONS HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT THERE HOUSING PEOPLE. FOR OFTENTIMES SERIOUS CRIMES THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY WONDERFUL FOLKS BUT THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AND WE THE PUBLIC ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE. TRANSPARENCY. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PRISONERS ARE. BEING CARED FOR APPROPRIATELY WITH BASIC LEVELS OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOU POINTED OUT THAT -- THERE THERE ISN'T THAT KIND OF SUNSHINE. IN OUR PRIVATE PRISONS AND THE MOTIVATION FOR THEM IS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE AS PRIVATE ENTERPRISES THEIR GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT. OF NOT NECESSARILY TO MAXIMIZE REHABILITATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM IN OUR PUBLIC PRISONS BUT SOMETHING THAT WERE WORKING ON TO TRY TO IMPROVE -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA IN ALSO TRYING TO ABOLISH. FOR A PROFIT PRISONS AND TO IT'S THIS MEASURES BEFORE COMMITTED BECAUSE OF THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK TO BAN. FOR PROFIT CIVIL INCARCERATION IN OUR STATE. I THINK -- THERE IT MAY VERY WELL BE A A CHALLENGE BY THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION ON A ONE OF WE EVER DONE ANYTHING IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVEN'T CHALLENGED BUT I THINK THAT. OF A ROBUST CONSTITUTION ANALYSIS IS SO ALSO PROVIDED FOR IN OUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND I SUSPECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE. IT IF -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO SUE THE STATE I THINK THIS BILL IS ADDRESSING ALL PRIVATE PRISONS. AND WE HAVE HAD A CONCERTED EFFORT IS MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY THANKS TO MY GOOD FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR KEWL -- TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE UPON THEM AND TO THE OPPOSITION -- MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN FIND OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX AND HOPEFULLY -- FIND WAYS -- TO TO BETTER ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE RATES OF PEOPLE IN PRISON -- GOING FORWARD AS WELL SO -- THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS OR ANYONE ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK. OF WILL START WITH US SENATOR DRAWS A WIN AND A SENATOR JONES -- I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND A FEW WOULD ALLOW ME TO BE A CO AUTHOR I WOULD. LOVE TO HAVE THAT BE HONORED THANK YOU -- I MEAN SO MANY THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID I JUST WANT TO ADD TO THAT THAT -- WE HAVE FOUND ON THE ON THE OF FACILITIES THAT WERE CONTRACTED OUT ON THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION -- THAT MANY TIMES AND THESE ARE OFFICIAL REPORTS BY EITHER -- COMBINATION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DISABILITY RIGHTS -- CALIFORNIA IS THAT MANY OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. CONTRACT THEM OUT TO PRIVATE ENTITIES AND THIS SORT OF ABSOLVE THEMSELVES OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY. NO OVERSIGHT -- NO STANDARDS NO EFFORT TO ENFORCE A STANDARD JUST OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND AND THEY SELL IT ON THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN EITHER. IS NO ADVANTAGE OF AND FRANKLY IF THERE'S A WAY. IF THERE'S PROFIT. THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED. FOR THE WELL BEING OF THOSE INCARCERATED AND FOR THOSE WHO SERVE THE INCARCERATED AND PROGRAM SO -- I AM VERY VERY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE THE WITNESSES AND AND ALL THAT YOU DO IN PARTICULAR. THEIR RECITE SHERIFF'S A YOU COME WITH THE POINT OF VIEW OF NOT ONLY THOSE WHO SERVE AND DO THE SERVICE BUT ALSO YOU'RE WATCHING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE INSIDE SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATOR JONES. IT'S A JUST A QUICK QUESTION I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BUT I MISSED A NEXUS ON ONE OF THE COMMENTS. THAT ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SAID THAT -- SHE DID WANT TO SEE BABY SLEEPING ON CONCRETE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE BILL IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT PLEASE. SORRY NOT NOT MY COMMENT SO NOT -- DON'T HAVE THE A FULL LINE OF SIGHT ON WHAT WAS THE INTENTION OF THAT COMMENT MADE BY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC BUT I I I WILL SAY THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE AS PART ORGANIZED. WITNESS TESTIMONY SOAKING THANK YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME AS YOU DID. CENTER. ALL RIGHT US SING NO OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I FIRST ONE TO SAY THE TWENTY ANALYSIS WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- IT WAS COMPREHENSIVE IT WAS INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL WAS INCREDIBLY INSIGHTFUL AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT SO SO THANK YOU FOR THAT CONTRIBUTION ON ON ON THIS ISSUE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND AND TO MANY OF US. FUNNY I TO SAY I THINK THE APPROACH IN THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE. WITH WITH WITH WITH STANDING UP FOR PEOPLE ON DEFENDING THEM. MAKING SURE THAT THEY LIVE IN OUR WITH WHEN THEY'RE DETAINED THERE AND DIGNIFIED DECENT. CUT COMPASSIONATE -- SAFE. CONDITIONS AND IN THIS BILL REALLY HAS IDENTIFIED -- WHAT WHAT WE ALL THAT IS THOUGHT TO BE TRUE WHICH IS THAT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE COMPANIES WITH A PROFIT SEEKING INCENTIVE ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST AT AT INVESTING IN IN OUR PEOPLE MAKING SURE THAT THEY SUCCEED? AND THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE REPORT AFTER REPORT MANY OF THEM IDENTIFIED CLEARLY IN IN THE ANALYSIS SHOWING THAT -- THE OUTCOMES ARE EXACTLY WHAT WE MADE EXPECTED THEM TO BE THAT THAT THAT OPERATIONAL COSTS ARE. ARE ARE ARE CUT ODD CORNERS ARE CUT COSTS ARE CUT -- LONGER IF THERE'S LONGER STAYS IN FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS THAT. A AND AND FACILITIES THAT THE OB THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT THRIVE ON MORE AND MORE MASS INCARCERATION WEREN'T PRESENT OF CALIFORNIANS MEDICAL CARE -- THE ACCESS TO THAT IS IS LAST THERE ARE MORE SALTS. BETWEEN PRISONERS IN FOR PROFIT PRIVATE FACILITIES AND AND THE LIST GOES ON SO WE CAN DO BETTER WE MUST DO BETTER A. B. THIRTY TO HELP US DO THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR BOTH THANK YOU THANK YOU WOULD YOU -- MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL IN THE MOTION IS -- DO PASSED TO SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. THIRTY TWO JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE PORCHES. RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES. JONES NO MONNING STERN UMBERG. NUMBER OF IOWA CASKEY BY KASKI AYE. THE THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF. OF MOVING RIGHT ALONG TO FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWO FOR UP BY MY FRIEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. I THINK WE SAW THIS BILL LAST YEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON ALWAYS LOVE THOSE TIES WHICH ONE IS THAT IS SET FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY [inaudible] VERY NICE. OUR LET'S WAIT IF YOU WOULD JUST A SECOND SO THAT WE CAN CLEAR THE ROOM AND BE ABLE TO HEAR. SAYS FILE ITEM. TO CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE PRESIDING AB ONE SIXTY A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE ABILITY TO ENACT A VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE PROGRAM IN HIRING. THE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCES RECOGNIZE ENJOYED AMONG THE PUBLIC SECTOR HOWEVER THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA IS LIMITED TO ONLY VIETNAM WAR ERA VETERANS. WHEN EXERCISING OR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE AB ONE SIXTY SIMPLY REVISES AN OUTDATED OVERSIGHT BY ALLOWING THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO EXERCISE OUR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE TO ALL VETERANS WITH THE GENERAL OR HONORABLE DISCHARGE? REGARDLESS OF THE ERA IN WHICH THEY SERVE. THIRTY SEVEN STATES HAVE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE. THE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE. AND THIS IS ANOTHER AMENDMENT WE PUT ON BEING VERY SENSITIVE TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY [inaudible] THIS AMENDMENT. WOULD NOT BECOME OPERATIVE UNTIL THE PROHIBITION AGAINST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS FROM SERVING IN THE U. S. ARMED FORCES UNDER FEDERAL LAW IS RESCINDED. YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES ON THAT. ONE FOR THESE REASONS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE SUPPORT. JUST BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AB ONE SIXTY WILL HELP OUR VETERANS TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT IN BOTH OF OUR MEMBERS. AND THE OR FAMILY HAVE MILITARY VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE PROBABLY SUPPORT EFFORTS YOU. SEEK TO HELP THESE. BETTER SERVE OUR COUNTRY. RESPECT LAST NIGHT VOTE THANK THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI KELLY MAY DOUGLAS WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE HAVE A FEW WISHES WE COULD TALK WITH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ABOUT IT WILL STICK AROUND [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT. EXCUSE ME QUICK ARE YOU HERE IN OPPOSITION OUR GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMANMEMBERS TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL AND APPLAUD EFFORTS TO ENSURE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR VETERANS. HOWEVER WE ARE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STRATEGY AND THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. WHICH SETS A SLIPPERY PRECEDENT BY GIVING PREFERENCE TO ONE GROUP AREADY PROTECTED BY THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER MARGINALIZED GROUPS PROTECTED BY FEET HIGH. SUCH AS LGBTQ PEOPLE AND WOMEN GROUPS THAT ALSO FACE HIGH RATES OF WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION EMPLOYMENT ETCETERA UNEMPLOYMENT ETCETERA. AND DENNIS DON'T TELL WHICH BANNED PEOPLE FROM SERVING BASED ON THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WAS ONLY LIFTED IN AT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THE BAN ON TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEMBERS REMAINS IN EFFECT. AND EVEN IF THAT WERE TO BE LIFTED TOMORROW THE SYSTEMIC AND HISTORIC MARGINALIZATION WOULD NOT BE REMEDIED OVERNIGHT. AND THIS BILL WOULD LIKELY COMPOUNDED THE DISCRIMINATION THAT LGBTQ PEOPLE ALREADY FACE. ALSO WE SEE THAT WOMEN WOULD IN PRACTICE BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY AT NINE POINT 4% OF VETERANS NATIONWIDE OR WOMEN. AND THAT NUMBER WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER IN CALIFORNIA AT EIGHT POINT 5% SO WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO IMPROVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS BUT FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. REMOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE NEXT WITNESSES IN OP IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. ENTER MEMBERS KEVIN BACON FROM AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. MILITARY VETERAN STATUS IS PROTECTED STATUS UNDER FEE HOW UNLIKE IT IN MOST STATES. IT IS INDEED -- AND USUAL PROPOSITION TWO SELECT ONE GROUP OF FOR THE OF WHO'S A STATUS IS PROTECTED. AND GRANT THEM PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OVER EVERY OTHER GROUP I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WERE CAN COINCIDENCE THAT APPROACH AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING EMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS FOR ANY OTHER -- PROTECTED GROUP THERE ARE SERIOUS -- CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES THAT VETERANS FACE WE HAVE OFFERED TO WORK WITH MISTER VOEPEL -- AND HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH A VETERAN COMMUNITIES AT THE ACLU. WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE POLICY PRESCRIPTION IT REALLY DOES LOCKED IN THE DISCRIMINATION THAT QUALITY CALIFORNIA -- WAS JUST SPEAKING TO AND WE HAS THE COMMITTEE TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR VIEW ON THIS AND AND CONTINUE. TO RESIST WHAT IS ATTEMPTING BUT NOT -- A DEFECTIVE SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF SO PLEASE COME STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS CAN WEIGHING ON BEHALF CALIFORNIAN PLUMBING LAWYERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BORCHERS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL I RESPECT AND ADMIRE YOUR DEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE. WHO SERVE THIS COUNTRY IN THE ARMED FORCES? I REMEMBER BACK AT THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR WHERE WE DID GIVE PREFERENCE POINTS I WAS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WITH THOSE PREFERENCE POINTS. IS THAT IT. RATED AN IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLE FOR WOMEN AT THAT TIME IN PARTICULAR WHO WERE A AND UNDERSERVED ARE UNDER REPRESENTED I SHOULD SAY A GROUP WHEN IT CAME TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE -- THIS OF COURSE APPLIES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL. AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER REALLY CAUGHT UP IN SO -- I CAN'T SUPPORT BILLS THAT AUTHORIZED GIVING A PREFERENCE TO A POPULATION THAT IS. APPROXIMATELY 90% MALE. AND A POPULATION THAT HAS HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE NOW I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THAT AMENDMENT BUT I THINK AS WAS ARTICULATED THAT IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE. THE PROBLEM -- IN A NEARLY SIMILAR BILL FAILED IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR -- BUT OF THE THE BILL CREATES A PREFERENCE FOR ONE PROTECTED GROUP OVER ANOTHER AND THAT HISTORICALLY FACES BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT WERE FIGHTING HARD NOW TO LIFT THOSE BARRIERS. FOR WOMEN ARE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THIS PUTS THE THUMB BACK ON IT. EVEN THOUGH IT IS FOR A GROUP OF THAT I HIGHLY RESPECT. BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE ALREADY PROTECTIONS THEY ARE AND AGAIN I I CHOSE STUFF I THINK THAT THEPOLICY IS A WRONG ONE WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER GROUPS THAT ALSO. ARE FIGHTING HARD TO TO GAIN THAT LEVEL OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS BILL WILL. CREATE -- IT IN GREATER MEASURE FOR ONE GROUP OVER ANOTHER SO -- SENATOR UMBERG I KNOW YOU WANTED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WILL. A AND CENTER ON BURKE FALL BY AS SENATOR JONES. I'M I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL -- AT THE CONTEST I HAVE A BIAS IN FAVOR OF VETERANS IS SO STRONG I MARRIED A VETERAN -- AND SHE IS ALWAYS OUTRANK ME ONLY BECAUSE SHE'S SMARTER AND A BETTER LEADER -- BUT IF I TODAY ADVERTISE IN NEWSPAPERS SAID I HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR HIRING VETERANS WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE [inaudible] SENATOR. THE VETERAN COMMUNITY AS YOU PROBABLY WELL KNOW IS NOT MADE UP OF 16218% [inaudible] WOMEN. AND GROWING DRAMATICALLY -- THE CONSEQUENCE IN THIRTY SEVEN OTHER STATES. HAS BEEN NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER -- BUT HERE LET ME MAYBE I SHOULD DRESS TO THE OPPOSITION WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE TODAY IF IF I SIMPLY PUT AN AD IN NEWSPAPERS SAID I HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS. ETCETERA CAVENDER COMMITTED CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT WOULD NOT PROTECT YOU WITH THAT. PREFERENCE WAS BEING USED -- TO GRANT OF SPECIAL TREATMENT TO THAT GROUP AT AS A WAY OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES. SO YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A VETERANS PREFERENCE BUT IF YOUR EXERCISE THAT PREFERENCE IN A WAY THAT DISCRIMINATES. AGAINST ANOTHER PROTECTED CLASS YOU WOULD BE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THAT DISCRIMINATION THIS BILL WOULD. REMOVE ANY -- PROTECTION FOR THOSE OTHER GROUPS. OKAY IT AND I ASSUME BY YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD THINK WE SHOULD RISKS AND ANY PREFERENCE AND AND GOVERNMENTAL HIRING ALSO FOR VETERANS. THAT THAT BILL ISN'T BEFORE A SLIGHT BUT LET'S NOT. LET LET'S SAY I'M A BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THE LOGIC SO WELL. I I THINK THAT AGAIN LET'S FOCUS ON THE BILL BEFORE US AND IT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BRING THAT OTHER BILL RIGHT NOW THEREIS A PREFERENCE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. FOR A IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT VETERANS TO GET ADDITIONAL PREFERENCE -- AND THE BILL HERE IS TO TRY TO CREATE THAT ALSO FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS COMPARED TO TAKING THAT PREFERENCE IN GETTING RID OF IT ON ALL LEVELS SO. I THINK THAT THE AGAIN. I WOULD APPRECIATE GIVEN OUR CALENDAR TODAY WE FOCUS ON THE BILL'S AT HAND -- BUT LET ME ASK THE QUESTION THE OPPOSITION IF FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL SAID DISABLED VETERANS WOULD THAT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE OPPOSITION. TO EITHER A SO YOU ARE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD CENTER AND BUT I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT MORE BUT MY MY FIRST REACTION IS THAT I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD ANY MORE THAN YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD. I MEAN I I THINK THERE IS A QUALITY TO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I EVER TIES AND SAID I WANT. A QUALIFIED CANDIDATE IS A COLLEGE EDUCATION. RIGHT I COULD THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT IF I SAID I WANT SOMEONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCE IN AN ORGANIZED ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE MISSION TRANSCENDS SELF RIGHT. BY SAID THAT. AND IN SAID THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD DISTINGUISH AN ANNEX IDENTIFY VETERANS THAT WOULD BE. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL [inaudible] WELL. FOR THE CHERRY IT'S IF I MAY. ANY PREFERENCE FOR A JOB RELATED SKILLS OR ABILITIES IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE NON DISCRIMINATORY. OKAY SO IF THIS BILL SAID THAT. WELL I'LL I'LL I'LL STOP THE HYPOTHETICALS -- OKAY OKAY THANK YOU IT AS SENATOR JONES -- I JUST WANNA APPLIED THE AUTHOR FOR HIS TENACITY. IN THIS -- PROJECT AND AND ONE MORE TIME -- YOU KNOW THE BILL'S OBVIOUSLY FAMILIAR TO ME. AS I THINK I BROUGHT UP FOR A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND ICE SIT HERE TODAY ONE MORE TIME FLABBERGASTED AT THE OPPOSITION. THERE ARE I'M REALLY EACH AND AND I'VE ADVISED AS I'VE. THE BILL THEN. ORDER THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WHEN HE'S KAREN IT LAST YEAR YOU KNOW IT REALLY TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE OPPOSITION ON THIS AND I I'M I'M REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME JOHN A NEXUS BETWEEN THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION IN THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND THAT -- THE EXAMPLES THAT HAVE. BEEN GIVEN IN THE PEOPLE THAT THIS MIGHT NEGATIVELY IMPACT ARE ALREADY PROTECTED CLASSES -- AGAINST -- DISCRIMINATION. AND THIS BILL IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF THOSE CLASSES ARE PROTECTED -- PEOPLE. BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN BE VETERANS -- IN IT YOU KNOW THEN THAT THE ADDITIONAL ARGUMENT THAT I THINK IN SUPPORT OF THIS. IS VETERANS ARE UNIQUE CLASS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THAT. THEY HAVE GIVEN THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AND BY EXTENSION OF THAT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM A BLANK CHECK. UP TO AND INCLUDING THE PRICE OF THEIR LIFE. NO OTHER PROTECTED CLASS OR UNPROTECTED CLASS OF AMERICAN CITIZEN -- OR RESIDENT FOR THAT MATTER. IS HAS DONE THAT AND SO. I REALLY DON'T. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME GRASPING THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES OPPOSITION. TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL THIS VERY SIMPLY WRITTEN. VERY INCLUSIVE OF THE VERY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ARGUED. THAT IMPACTS AND AND INCLUDES. WHAT I CALL WHAT I CONSIDER A VERY? PECULIAR SPECIAL CLASS OF AMERICAN RESIDENT THAT HAS OFFERED THEIR LIFE IN SUPPORT OF OURS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. I I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEAR. THERE'S SOME OF US WHO WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY EQUAL FOOTING. WE ALREADY HAVE BETTER ANSWERS A PROTECTED CLASS. IF YOU'RE BORN A WOMAN. YOU HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFER DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING. IT HAS IMPACTED YOUR FAMILY IS IMPACTED OTHERS -- AND SO WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE TO I THINK DISAGREE ON THAT IF YOU CAN RAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT SENATOR STERN. MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK THANK YOU SUMMER FOR NOT AGREEING THE BILL BUT YOUR SERVICE -- CAN I JUST NEED OF A LITTLE TECHNICAL CLARITY HERE SO. WITH THE IF. IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW WOULD IT OPERATE THE SAME WAY THE VETERANS PREFERENCE DOES IN THE CURRENT FOR FOR FOR STATE SERVICE IN OTHER WORDS. FOR BOTH -- A VETERAN AS WELL AS THEIR WIDOW WIDOWER -- OR SPOUSE. OR IS IT JUST FOR THE THE VETERAN THEMSELVES. BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW THE CHAIR POSITION KNOWS I WILL THE WAY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IT'S FOR VETERANS WITH HONORABLE OR GENERAL DISCHARGE. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER AMENDMENT MADE LAST YEAR FOR THE LGBT. COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST CHARGE WITH GENERAL DISCHARGES FOR YEARS THAT WAS AN INJUSTICE SO THIS HELPS. FIVE DEAD AND JUSTICE IN ALSO. FOR A LIST OF RECRUITS 43% OF MEN AND 56% OF WOMEN ARE HISPANIC OR RACIAL. MINORITY THE MILITARY FOLKS HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY FAR MORE DIVERSE SO. I WOULD ASKS A QUESTION. TO THE OPPOSITION. IF IT WAS A PROTECTED CLASS THAT WAS A VETERAN WOULD THAT BE VIOLATING. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU A DID YOU HAVE ANY. THIRTY FROM OPPOSITION DO YOU DO ON THOUGH IT JUST TECHNICALLY SPEAKING YOU. WOULD THERE BE DISCRETION TO APPLY THESE VETERANS PREFERENCE ALSO DO SURVIVING SPOUSE OR OR OR OR SPOUSE. OR IS IT THE WAY THAT THEY DO YOU READ THE TEXT LIMITED STRICTLY TO THE THAT THE ACT THAT INDIVIDUAL THEMSELVES. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR THE FOR THIS SORT OF STATE COROLLARY HERE -- I I DON'T HAVE WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO QUESTION SENATOR STERN BUT I I'D I DON'T READ IT. THIS IS CERTAINLY TO EXTEND TO FAMILY MEMBERS. I THINK THE QUESTION IS. WHO WHO'S IN THIS PROTECTED CLASSES IN THIS PREFERRED GROUP THAT AND WHO'S BEEN EXCLUDED TRADITIONALLY DESPITE WHAT THE REPRESENTATION MAY BE NOW WE'VE GOT A HISTORY OF THE LAST? FIFTY YEARS AT LEAST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN THE WORK FORCE. THE SHOW IF IF I MAY THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE BILL WHICH I THINK OR WHAT YOU BASE IT ON DOES NOT GIVE EXT DOES NOT EXTEND THE RGHT TO ANYONE OTHER THAN THE VETERAN. WHO IS RECEIVED AN HONORABLE OR A GENERAL DISCHARGE? EDIT I I GET THAT BUT I'M I'M SAYING IT. IS THE WAY THIS THE CODE IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. FOR THE FOR STATE HIRING PREFERENCES. IS THAT ALSO FREEZE THE SAME WAY AS THIS IN IN OTHER WILL THERE BE DISCRETION WHAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR IN ORDER CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE'S. IDENTIFIED HIM PAGE. NINE TO PROVIDE CIVIL SERVICE HIRING PREFERENCES FOR VETERANS AND THEIR SURVIVING SPOUSES -- CURRENTLY THERE IS A VETERANS PREFERENCE FOR SOME STATE DROPS SO THERE IS VETERANS PREFERENCE THAT EXIST AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT VETERANS PREFERENCE. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW UP 218% OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY WE ARE STILL WOMEN ARE STILL IN THE VAST MINORITY. THE ISSUE HERE THE POLICY ISSUE IS ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE ESSENTIALLY TO PERPETUATE. THAT DISCRIMINATION BY PUTTING THEIR FROM ON THE EMPLOYMENT SCALE BY ALLOWING ADDITIONAL PREFERENCE OF FOR VETERANS TO THE DETRIMENT OF OTHERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE MORE QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION IN THOSE OTHERS WOULD BE WOMEN. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO WE KNOW ARE NOT EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN THE WORK FORCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME ONE LAST QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS THERE. ARE YOU OPEN AT ALL TO JUST MIRRORING WHAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SAYS AS SHE JUST DESCRIBE THE THE VETERANS AND THEIR SURVIVING SPOUSE. I WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT YES. OKAY WE'VE AMENDED THIS ABOUT FOUR TIMES ALREADY OKAY. SENATOR UMBERG ARM AND IN SENATOR -- MADAM CHAIR A I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OF VIEW -- THINGS ARE CHANGING VERY QUICKLY RECENT CLASS OF WEST POINT GRADUATES HAD A PHENOMENAL. INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO GRADUATED. THE PROPORTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE MILITARY FAR EXCEEDS THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND THUS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE EXTENT HAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF REFERENCE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT IS ANALOGOUS THE PREFERENCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. YOU ARE ACTUALLY. YOUR ACTUALLY HELPING THOSE OF COLOR -- AS MY FINAL COUNT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] SENATOR GONZALEZ. TH -- I TO JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I'M A LITTLE STUCK HERE AS WELL BECAUSE I DO FEEL -- THAT YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY UNDER REPRESENTED IN SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE VETERAN -- GROUPS AND SO I HOPE -- THAT YOU KNOW IN THIS NEXT ITERATION WHATEVER -- COMES ABOUT TODAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND HOPEFULLY ACLU IN SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. TO HOPEFULLY GET THIS THIS RIGHT -- THE NEXT TIME AROUND SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MARCHING IN HEARING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES MA'AM. I CHAU CLOSED RELATIVELY FAST SO I'D LIKE TO PUT THIS IN SCALE. IN 201-617-0007 HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE RECRUITS ACROSS FIVE BRANCHES JOIN THE MILITARY OUT OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS BILL? IS THESE KIDS AND I WILL CALL THEM KIDS THEIR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN BUT TO ME THEIR KIDS WHEN THEY GET OUT. 80% OF THEM WERE LISTED MANY ONLY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. THEY'VE GOT TO DO THREE MAIN THINGS. GET A JOB. GO TO SCHOOL STAY OFF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL [inaudible] THAT'S CRITICAL. FOR THIS CLASS OF PEOPLE THEY NEED TO HAVE A FAIR CHANCE AND ONCE AGAIN A GREAT AMOUNT INCLUDING SEVENTEEN POINT 3%. OR AFRICAN AMERICAN OR HISPANIC OR WOMEN. SO EVERYTHING'S CHANGED DRAMATICALLY [inaudible] AND THEY NEED THE HELP TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE HOMELESS CAMPS. AND ALSO THE AVERAGE OF TWENTY VETERANS DIE BY SUICIDE EVERY DAY. BECAUSE OF HOPELESSNESS SO THAT'S MY PLEA FOR A RESPECTFUL PLEAD FOR A AYE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'D LET ME JUST ADD THAT I THINK THE REASON THAT THEY COMMIT SUICIDE IS MORE TO DO WITH THE LACK OF A CARE AFTER THEY RETURNED FROM DEPLOYMENT -- AND THAT'S MY HOPE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT. THESE FOLKS DESERVE A LOT BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED. WITH THEIR SERVICE I DON'T THINK THAT THE ADVANCING THIS JOB ISSUE PERSONALLY -- TO THE DETRIMENT OF OTHERS -- IS REALLY THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM REALLY IS THAT WE DON'T CARE FOR OUR VETERANS AND THEIR NEEDS WHEN THEY GET BACK FROM FROM THEIR SERVICE BUT THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE A MOTION. AND A MADAM SCRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS. A TO SENATE VETERANS AFFAIRS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB ONE SIXTY JACKSON NO JACKSON NO BORDERS. OR DECIDE TO RUSSELL GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ NO JONES. JONES I'M MONNING. STERN. STERN AYE AMBERG UMBERG IOWA CASKEY [inaudible] ORDER. TO THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES WILL PLACE IT ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH ADAM CHAIR IF I MAY. INJECTOR QUICK JUST IN CASE THE BILL FALLS SHORT AND ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE VOTE SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET IT -- BUT IF IT DOES FALL SHORT CAN WE OFFER THE AUTHOR RECONSIDERATION YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU. ARE YOU ASKING FOR RECONSIDERATION. AS A LOST YET OKAY WELL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. I DON'T YOU HAVE TO COME BACK IF. YOU WON'T HAVE TO COME BACK I LIKE YOUR OPTIMISM THEM THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ YOU HAVE A SERIES OF BILLS I'VE GOT TO GO RUN AND VOTE ON NATCHER IN -- PUBLIC SAFETY I HOPE THAT'S WHERE I'M HEADED -- SO I'M GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR TO START AND I SHOULD BE BACK SHORTLY MY APOLOGIES THAT'S OKAY. WHICH ONE RESTORING WITH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S -- GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK WERE -- IN THE PREFERENCE WAITING FOR THE NOISE TODAY DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BUT WE ARE -- WE'RE GOING TO VITAL ON FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE EIGHT BEES -- ONE SEVENTY ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- GONZALEZ THE FLOOR IS YOURS -- THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AB ONE SEVENTY SIX TO PROTECT OUR VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE OFTEN WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WERE IN MOST NEED PROTECTION FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE TREND WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY THE JANITORIAL IN HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES HAS BEEN TOWARD OUTSOURCING WORK TO STAFFING AGENCIES. THESE WORKERS MAY GO TO WORK EACH DAY AT THE SAME LOCATION WHEN THE UNIFORM OF THE OFFICE OR HOTEL THEIR CLEAN IN REPORTING TO MANAGERS ON SITE. HOWEVER THESE CONTRACTING COMPANIES AND HOTELS ARE NOT BEING HELD. RESPONSIBLE ONE SEXUAL RAM. HARASSMENT HAPPENS ON THEIR WATCH TO THEIR WORKERS WHAT IS RESULTED FROM THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE HORROR STORIES OF ABUSES IN THE WORKPLACE PERPETUATED BY THE SAME ACTORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED BY STORIES SANDERS HIS GET OFF A HOTEL WORKER WHO BRAVELY CAME FORWARD TO TELL HER STORY BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED ON THE JOB. AB ONE SEVENTY WOULD ENSURE THAT CONTRACT WORKERS LIKE SANDRA CAN SEEK RECOURSE FROM BOTH THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYER AND THE CONTRACTING EMPLOYER IF THEY ARE EXPERIENCED ANY FORM OF HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE PURPOSE OF THE THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO STOP THE HARASSMENT PREVENT FURTHER HARM. BY REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO SHARE CIVIL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CIVIL LIABILITY WORKERS WILL BE MORE POWER TO HOLD THEIR WORKPLACES ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

THESE IF YOU COULD TO KEEP IT TO TWO MINUTES. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND THE ISSUE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON AND THIS BILL IS THE USE OF BASICALLY PERMIT TEN OUTSIDE THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE WORKERS TO DO THE DATED A REGULAR WORK OF THE BUSINESS. ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT OFTENTIMES THIS ARRANGEMENT IS USED TO SHIELD. THE COMPANY -- FROM LIABILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO WORKERS I'M AT THE HAND BY THE HANDS OF THE CONTRACTORS. AND WE DID A BILL SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO SAY. IF THESE ARE YOUR REGULAR WORKERS DOING THE REGULAR FOR PORK UP YOUR BUSINESS YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR LABOR CONTRACTOR TO SHIELD YOU FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR WELL BEING. AND THAT BILL EXTENDED TO WAGES -- WORKERS COMP AND HEALTH AND SAFETY IT DID NOT EXTEND TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND WHAT WE'VE RECOGNIZED IS THAT THE SAME PATTERN EXISTS WHEN THE COMPANY'S NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEY LOOK THE OTHER WAY THEY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO DO WHAT THEY DO. OFTENTIMES SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS VERY MUCH INTERTWINED WITH OTHER KINDS OF WORK SITE ABUSES IT'S A WAY OF DEMEANING WOMEN AND AND MEN AND MAKING THEM FEEL -- INTIMIDATED AND AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND SO WE THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO EXTEND THE SAME PROTECTIONS. THIS DOES ENSURE THAT THE THE MASTER EMPLOYER THE CLIENT EMPLOYER HAS NOTICED THAT VIOLATIONS ARE GOING ON IT IS ULTIMATELY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN PEOPLE WORKERS ARE DOING WORK ON THEIR PROMISES. TO ENSURE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS NOT GOING ON AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN MANY CASES IT IS RAMPANT ACROSS THE BOARD -- AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL SOLVE UP FOR A LOT OF THAT BY HOLDING THE COMPANY ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. TARA MOVING ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANY MEMBER HE PUBLIC WISHING TO COMMENT IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION THANK YOU. ALI'S AGO REPRESENTING AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN IN SUPPORT. STEVEN WEBER ASKED ME CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. YOUR TO BE AN ATTACK ARE THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. AND MY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ERIN O'NEILL MULLIN BURKE ON BEHALF OF PORK EQUITY IN SUPPORT. MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND SUPPORT. MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION ALSO SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW SOME OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ALSO SUPPORT. LIZ SORENSON WITH CW A DISTRICT NINE ALSO IN SUPPORT AND FOR THE SAKE OF TIME IM GONNAHAVE MY FOLKS STAND UP PLEASE AND SUPPORTING THESE ARE ALL OUR CW A MEMBERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROAD WITH THE TEAMSTERS UNITE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBER THE PUBLIC WISHING TO COMMENT. ALRIGHT MOVING ON TO FOLKS WISHING TO VOICE OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES. WE SHOULD EXPRESS OPPOSITION. ONCE YOU GRAVITY RIGHT OVER HERE. YOU PLEASE KEEP IT TO TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BENEFIT COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- WHICH ESTABLISHES AUTOMATIC JOINT LIABILITY FOR CLIENT EMPLOYERS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT IF THE LABOR CONTRACTORS LIABLE. WE ACTUALLY THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DID A VERY GOOD JOB ON THIS POINT AND CLARIFIED THAT THIS IS IN FACT AN AUTOMATIC JOINT LIABILITY BILL. I THINK THERE'D BEEN SOME MONEY IN OF THE WATERS OF THAT POINT A PRIOR CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS COMMITTEE AND ALSO SAYS THAT IS RIGHT ON AND IT STATES -- IF THE LABOR CONTRACTORS LIABLE FOR THE WORKPLACE HARASSMENT IN THE CLIENT EMPLOYERS AUTOMATICALLY LIABLE FOR THAT WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. AS WELL AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF ARE CONCERNED WE DON'T WE THINK THERE ARE SITUATIONS THAT WE CAN ALL ENVISIONED WHERE PROBABLY MAKES SENSE TO HOLD THE LINE PLAYER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LABOR CONTRACTORS. ACTIVITIES WHERE THERE'S THE REQUISITE LEVEL OF OF CONTROLLER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SITUATION BUT WE CAN PROBABLY ALSO IMAGINE SITUATIONS WHERE. THE CLIENT EMPLOYER HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OR NO CONTROL OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACTIVITY OCCURRING. AND WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- TO HOLD THEM AUTOMATICALLY LIABLE IN THAT SITUATION. AND I JUST WANT TO DIRECT THE COMMITTEE TO PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCENARIO WILL PLAY OUT -- AND IT SAYS UNDER THIS BILL THE CLIENT EMPLOYERS JOINTLY LIABLE FOR WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. THAT THE LABOR CONTRACTOR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT EVEN IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER ITSELF DID NOT HAVE ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT THEIR HARASSMENT. THUS IF THE LABOR CONTRACTOR DIRECTLY HARASSED WORKER SUPPLIED BY THE LABOR CONTRACTORS IN THE PLANE OF WHERE WOULD BE JOINTLY LIABLE WITH THE LABOR CONTRACTOR FOR THAT HARASSMENT. EVEN IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN IT OCCURRED. SIMILARLY IF ONE WORKER SUPPLIED BY THE LABOR CONTRACTOR FOR US ANOTHER WORKER SUPPLIED BY THE LABOR CONTRACTOR. AND THE LABOR CONTRACTOR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE HARASSMENT BUT DID NOT TAKE ACTION TO STOP IT. THEN THE CLIENT EMPLOYER WOULD BE JOINTLY LIABLE WITH THE LABOR CONTRACTOR FOR THAT HARASSMENT. EVEN IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER ITSELF DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TIME. SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO AUTOMATICALLY HOLD DECLINE EMPLOYER LIABLE IN THAT SITUATION AND WE THINK THE COMMON LAW TEST WITH LOOKS AT THE LEVEL OF CONTROL IS THE IS THE BEST BALANCE OF OF APPORTIONING LIABILITY IN SITUATION. AND FINALLY THE ALE THE ONLY OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS. THE EXISTING JOINT LIABILITY SECTION LABOR CODE TWENTY TEN POINT THREE WHICH EXTEND LIABILITY TO WAGES AND WORKERS COMP -- THOSE ARE MORE OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE -- THE MANAGER OF THAT BILL WAS VOTE YOUR CONTRACTORS I THINK THAT'S EASIER TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO WAGES AND WORKERS COMPENSATION YOU CAN VERIFY WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE BY MAKING A PHONE CALL. YOU CAN DO A PAIR AUDIT. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE TYPES OF ISSUES RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE NECESSARILY AS OBJECTIVE FIVE LEAVE VERIFY VERIFIABLE BY A LABOR CONTRA ARIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OF THOSE WITH ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO COMMENT -- IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR NAME. AFFILIATION AND POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MATTHEW ALL OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION OF WE WOULD ALIGN OUR A A POSITION WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE CHAMBER [inaudible] YOU. KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE HERE IN OPPOSITION AS WELL. BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE CALL RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBER THE PUBLIC WISHING TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS. MEMBERS OF THE BOARD -- YES CENTER AKOWSKI. THANK YOU I AM. ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN OF OUR ANALYSIS WE TALKED ABOUT -- WHO'S EXEMPT IN NINETY UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE LESS THAN -- TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES ARE VERY LARGE EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE ONLY FIVE A CONTRACTORS BUT THERE'S CARVE OUTS. FOR COMMUNITY NONPROFITS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND APPRENTICESHIP GROUPS WHITE WITH THE SEC WORKPLACE HARASSMENT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT RISE TO THE SAME LOCATION AS THE OTHER. WORKPLACE HARASSMENT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO STAMP OUT. IT THAT WAS THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE LABOR CODE ON ON OUR WAGE ISSUES AND WORKERS COMP ISSUES ONE THE REASONS IS -- AND LET'S TAKE LIKE. A HIRING HALL FOR EXAMPLE -- THAT IS DISTRIBUTING THEIR WORKERS TO A PLACE OF BUSINESS IS MAYBE THAT THE ACTUAL -- EMPLOYEE WHO MIGHT BE THE ACTUAL PLAY RECORD LIKE THE PAYROLL SERVICES. IT NOTES IS NOT ON SITE THEY'RE NOT. PARTICIPATING IN ANY WAY IT'S JUST A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP AND WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT WITH -- WITH THE CONSULTANT ABOUT WHETHER WE NEEDED TO TRANSFER BUT WE WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LABOR CODE IF YOU HAVE WITH US WELL TO BE HONEST AND IT'S BEEN TOUGH -- TO EVERY EVERY TIME WE PUT IT SOMEWHERE THE OPPOSITION SAYS IT DOESN'T BELONG THERE -- BUT WE HAD WORK WE DECIDED TO STICK WITH THE HAT DESPITE MY BELIEF THAT IT SHOULD BE IN LABOR CODE BUT IF IT'S THE LABOR CODE. THE DEFINITIONS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO LABOR CODE SO WE SETTLED ON FEE HAT AND WE TRIED TO TAKE ALL OF THE SECTIONS THAT. MATCHED THE THE STRICT LIABILITY OR THE JOINT LIABILITY IN THE LABOR CODE AND PUT IT INTO THE HUNDRED THE SECTION SO THAT'S WHY THOSE ARE THERE ANY KIND OF A REAL EXAMPLE IN IN A REASONING -- WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION. FOR ALL THOSE EXEMPTIONS IN. MADAM CHAIR A GUEST OF THE FOLLOW UP TO THE OBJECTION ABOUT. THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE CONTRACTED FOLKS IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I GUESS YOU KNOW I SEE A AS AN CREATION SEEN OTHERS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONTROL. BUT IT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE JOINT LIABILITY IF FACTUALLY THERE WERE NO CONTROL THAT WOULD AFFECT. A CREW TO THE THE EMPLOYER YOU HAVE A THERE IS CONTROL THOUGH THAT THE SITUATION BY WHICH THESE OF THESE EMPLOYERS ARE JOINTLY LIABLE -- WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM THESE OTHER SITUATION SO YOUR ON SITE YOU'RE DOING THE WORK OF THEIR THEIR ON SITE AS WELL -- AND THEIR NUMBER THINGS THE EMPLOYER CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT HIRING BAD CONTRACTORS THAT THEIR ENSURING THAT THEIR CONTRACTORS ACTUALLY TEACHING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND HOLDING THEM TO A STANDARD. THIS IS TO ENSURE IT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEN IS. IS MASTER EMPLOYERS WHO BASICALLY SAY THIS IS NOT MY PROBLEM IT IS YOUR PROBLEM THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO HOLD THEM LIABLE THAN TO HOLD THEM JOINTLY LIABLE IN THE SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF OF OF WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE DONE WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE CONTINUE TO BE DONE IS THE TERROR NAY ARE SOME OTHER. BIG ENTITY CONTRACTING WITH A CONTRACTOR THAT CONTRACTOR GETS SUED RIGHTFULLY FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THING THEY GO UNDER IF YOU WELL -- MAYBE DECLARE BANKRUPTCY -- AND THEN COME BACK AS A NEW CONTRACTOR AND THE MASTER PLAYERS AS WELL THIS IS OUR PROBLEM YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY HERE IT IS WE'RE SAYING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS DIFFERENT IF THESE EMPLOYEES. BY THE WAY THEY'RE WORKING AT YOUR RESORT WEARING YOUR UNIFORM A LOT OF THEM DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING EMPLOYED BY SOMEBODY ELSE YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL. THANK YOU OF SENATOR BORCHERS. VENTURE -- FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES -- QUESTION. I TOO WAS KIND OF TROUBLED WITH THE IDEA OF LABOR CONTRACTORS -- IN THE CARVE OUT SAID NGUYEN ALONG WITH THEM INCLUDING THE MOTION PICTURE SERVICES. AT A TABLE SERVICE. THE MOTION PICTURE HEY ROLE SERVICES AND IT SAYS HERE THAT IF IT. SATISFIES ONE OF THE CRITERIA. AND THAT IS THAT THEY ARE SIGNATORY TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS THAT. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND NONTRADITIONAL LABOR CONTRACTORS OF YOUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PAYROLL SERVICE. THE WAY WE AND SHORE -- QUITE FRANKLY OF OTHER BILLS TO DEAL WITH THIS NOW THE WAY WE ENSURE THAT -- THESE FORMERLY WHAT WE THOUGHT OF IS KIND OF GIG WORKERS ARE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES AND NOT -- CONTRACTED JUST INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EMPLOYER OF RECORD AND PAYROLL SERVICE BASICALLY ACTS AS THAT BUT THEY IN NO WAY HAVE CONTROL OVER -- THE WORKPLACE OF THAT WORKER SO IT IS -- A UNIQUE SITUATION BY WHICH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE -- I TRUST IN A UNION -- THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO REMAIN EMPLOYEES AND YET BE WORKING FOR A MULTIPLE DIFFERENT. EMPLOYERS IF YOU WILL EVERY DAY HE DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS IF IN -- IT WORKS SO WE CAN TELL OVER LIVE THAT THIS HAPPENS -- IT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED SO YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PAYROLL SERVICE WHO IS NOT AT THE PLACE OF BUSINESS WHO IS NOT. HAVING ANY INTERACTION BUT PROVIDING THE WORK FORCE IN THE PAYROLL AND TAKING OUT THE TAXES AND DOES THAT MAKE SENSE I'M TRYING TO MAKE -- IF ANYONE CAN CHIME IN WITH THE NAME WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE THE COURT DECISION ON IS. THAT SAID OR DONE THAT THAT'S I HAVE ANOTHER BILL I'M NOT AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE MOVEMENT OF A THROUGH THAT -- THROUGH THAT CASE LAW IS THAT INDIVIDUALS ON EVEN IF THEY'RE PART TIME CONTRACT -- TâM. WOULD FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF EMPLOYEE. HOW DOES THAT BEAR OUT WITH THE IDEA THAT? I ANY INTERMEDIARY WOOD. THE SITUATION JOINT LIABILITY WITH THE EMPLOYER. THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS -- AND IN SOME WAYS I COULD GIVE YOU THIS EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IT IS IN COURT DEFENDING AGAINST -- OF RAPE CHARGES -- THAT THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER BECAUSE THEIR DRIVER THEY SAY IS A SEPARATE BUSINESS SO IN SOME WAYS WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY. THAT UNDER THEIR MISGUIDED. BELIEF THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE LAW THEY THEY ARE A MASTER COMPANY A CONTRACTING WITH THESE WORKERS THESE WORKERS -- THESE CONTRACTED WORKERS RAPE SOMEBODY AND THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY -- ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS TO FIX THIS IS TO BE CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE WORKERS OF THE COMPANY. IF THEY WERE USING A TEMPORARY AGENCY HOWEVER WE HAVE TO BE MORE CLEAR THAT THAT TEMPER AGENT TEMPORARY AGENCY. BUT THEY STILL WERE RESPONSIBLE. OKAY SO IS THAT MAKES SENSE THIS IS LIKE A LOT OF LABOR LAW THAT CROSS. HIS TOGETHER I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND AND IT'S LIKE ALMOST A DIAGRAM RIGHT I'M TRYING I'M TRYING TO APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITY MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M TRYING. TO CONTEMPLATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE. BY THIS LEGISLATION -- CREATING JOINT LIABILITY THAT EAT THAT THIS IS NOT OUR FOR CLOSING -- THE THE CONTRACTING OUT OF LABOR MAKING CERTAIN THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE IN HOUSE BY VIRTUE MAKING EVERYONE AN EMPLOYEE. AND THAT IN THIS GIG ECONOMY COULD BE TERRIBLY DANGEROUS -- IN THAT IS OF OF CONCERN BUT ALL A LEAVE MY FINAL COMMENTS HERE. THAT THE IDEA OF AN EMPLOYER. OR A PRINCIPLE ENTITY CONTRACTING WITH AN INTERMEDIARY FOR SERVICE IS BEING -- PERFORMED BY -- ANOTHER PARTY. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT IS THE CASE LAW NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH THAT IF IN INDIVIDUALS HIRED -- AND HAS A SEXUAL PREDATORY A CRIMINAL RECORD. THAT THEY COULD NOT -- ASSUME LIABILITY HERB PROJECT LIABILITY ON TO THE ENTITY THAT HIRED -- THE THERE'S NOT ONLY I MEAN THAT'S A UNIQUE CASE BUT THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS A SITUATION IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE A PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IT'S THAT. I'M QUITE FRANKLY AND AND WE SEE THIS IN A LOT OF IMMIGRANT WORK FORCES -- MANY OF THE WORKERS DON'T KNOW THE LAW AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD BILLS -- IN THE PAST TO FIX IT WITH FARMWORKERS AND WITH JANITORS BECAUSE BOTH THE WORKER AND THE SUPERVISORS WHO ARE OFTEN I'M IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES DON'T. KNOW OUR LAWS ARE NOT TRAINED IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWS IN THESE CONTRACTORS USE THESE WORKERS BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER QUITE FRANKLY HAVE. OF LEGISLATION THAT MANDATES THAT -- THAT TYPE OF EDUCATION. WE WE HAVE BEEN AND FACT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS PASSING THAT TYPE. OF LET'S JUST NOT A NEW ISSUE WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE ADDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN LIABILITY. IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT OF TOTAL FINISH UP IN ALL FINISH UP WITH THIS IF YOU THE IF YOU JUST LET ME FINISH. IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT. AND THIS IS JUST SIMPLY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL. AREA OF REQUIREMENT FOR COMPANIES THAT UP THAT TO HAVE. RESPONSIBILITY NOW IN LIABILITY NOW -- FOR OTHER KINDS OF CONDUCT. DAD ARE VIEWED TO TO VIOLATE CALIFORNIA POLICY IN CALIFORNIA LAW. I'M NOT CERTAIN I UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN I WHEN I HEAR LEGISLATORS SAY THE WORD JUST. I IMMEDIATELY HAVE EVER REACTION LEGISLATION PUT FORWARD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHEN IT'S SIMPLE AND IT DENOTES SOMETHING IT'S JUST. THIS IS CONSEQUENTIAL SORRY JAZZ SO WHAT WHAT DID I USE JUST IN WHAT CONTEXT I USE JUST NOT YOU OKAY I'M SORRY -- AND ALL IN ALL IN ALL IN HERE I THINK THE IDEA OF EDUCATION I THINK IS IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THAT BAD ACTORS HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT INTO THE WORK FORCE AND THE YOU KNOW COVER MY EYES IN AND COVER MY EARS ATTITUDE DOES EXIST IT DOES. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS OVER EXTENDS IN CREATING JOINT LIABILITY ACROSS THE BOARD. IS IS IS OVERBROAD I'D LIKE TO SEE IT REFINED OUT KNOW EXACTLY HOW AT THIS POINT BUT THAT THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN THANK YOU NEXT OF SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR OF FOR BRINGING THIS UP AND ON BEHALF OF SO MANY WORKERS IN MANY INDUSTRIES. AWARE THIS IS AN ISSUE -- AND IT'S TOO BAD THAT AFTER MANY YEARS. OF THIS ISSUE BEING BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT IN INDUSTRY AFTER INDUSTRY. YOU WOULD THINK THAT EMPLOYERS WHO DO HIRE CONTRACTORS. WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WOULD JUST ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY SO TO HEAR. IN THE CASE OF THE TERROR NAY UP ABOUT THIS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE COMPANY. NOT WANTING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR THEM DAY IN AND DAY OUT -- I THINK IS IS -- IS REALLY TERRIBLE ALSO ADDING A SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO THAT LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY COMES ONLY BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I WOULD BE THE LAST ONE TO SAY LET'S LEGISLATE ON THAT IF YOU TOOK RESPONSIBILITY AND IS THE LAST THING IS -- RETALIATION ARE IS FOR ANY EMPLOYEE WHO STANDS UP FOR THESE ISSUES ESPECIALLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PRIMARILY BY WOMEN IS SOMETHING THAT -- IS DONE THROUGH A SUBCONTRACTOR. SO IF YOU STAND UP AND YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WHAT'S GOING ON THE CONTRACTOR WON'T THANK YOU BACK THAT'S IT YOU'RE DONE. SO -- I THINK FOR ALL THOSE REASONS -- I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS -- CONTINUOUS EFFORT TO BRING THIS TO EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION THANK YOU AND ART WE HAVE A MOTION -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST CLOSE WITH -- WITH DUE RESPECT TO THE TO THE SENATOR WHO HAVEN'T HAD CHANCE TO SIT DOWN WITH -- PRIOR TO THIS. I THINK WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF OF AN EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY AND THE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE -- IN AND YOU'LL SEE IT THROUGHOUT MY BILLS IN THIS COMMITTEE QUITE FRANKLY BUT THE THE CORPORATE ACTORS WHO -- CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO NOT BE RESPONSIBLE -- FOR WORKERS THAT ARE DOING. THAT THEIR BUSINESS THAT THEY'RE PROFITING OFF OF HAS GOT US TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO CREATE LAWS TO ENSURE ON THAT THOSE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED THAT TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED -- AND THAT WE CAN RUN AN ORDERLY WAY SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH CONTRACTING OUT IN IN THE CASE THAT -- THAT HAPPENED THAT FORCED ME TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS. THE DISHWASHER SHE COMPLAINED TO THE RESORT SHE COMPLAINED TO THE EMPLOYER THE MASTER EMPLOYER AND THEY SAID IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. YES THAT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT OUR WORKER EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS RIGHT THERE THAT YOU WORK FOR US YOU DON'T WORK FOR US THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT WITH THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO STOP THAT INTO AB LIABILITY AND SO -- I IT'S NOT LOTS OF NEVER PERFECT AND WE'RE ALWAYS AIMING UNFORTUNATELY THE WORST ACTORS BUT THIS ONE THIS CASES WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I RESPECT LAST FROM ABOUT THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY. THERE IS A MOTION -- DISHES TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HEIGHTS JACKSON AYE BORDERS. WE'RE JUST NOTED RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES. MONNING STERN STERN I BURKE. BY KELSEY. KELSEY I WRITE THE BILL HAS A FIVE VOTES WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN AND A MOVING ON QUICKLY. OTHER -- FILE ITEM OF FOUR IS AB -- ONE SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ONE SEVENTY ONE THAT IS ANOTHER BILL WE'VE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE AGAIN -- LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID I'M LISTENING TOWARDS BASICALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD -- THE MOST FROM WOMEN WHO DID NOT WANT TO FILE A LAWSUIT. WAS THAT THEY WERE AFRAID -- TO EVEN TELL THEIR SUPERVISOR EMPLOYER THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED IN ONCE SOME. SOME SORT OF CHANGE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE RETALIATED AGAINST IF YOU FILE A LAWSUIT YOU DO HAVE PROTECTIONS AGAINST RETALIATION BUT IF YOU SIMPLY HAVE NO DESIRE TO FILE A LAWSUIT MAYBE BECAUSE YOUR IMMIGRATION STATUS MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW A LAWYER. YOU DON'T REALLY CARE YOU JUST WANT THE DISHWASHER TO OR WHOEVER IT IS TO QUIT. BUT IN YOU TELL YOUR YOUR SUPERVISOR IN THEY SWITCH YOUR SCHEDULE OR THEY FIRE YOU -- THAT'S THAT'S NOT OKAY FOR THIS WOULD WOULD BE A PRESUMPTION RETALIATION IF WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF NOTIFYING A SUPERVISOR -- ANYTHING NEGATIVELY HAPPENS TO YOU THAT IT WOULD BE A PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION FOR THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- DISCUSSION. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES PLEASE MADAM MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AS YOU WELL KNOW MOST WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE OUT WELL WHICH MEANS THEY CAN BE FIRED ANY TIME. FOR ANY REASON AND THAT IS WHY WORKERS ARE SO AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT ABUSES ON THE JOB BECAUSE THEY CAN BE FIRED THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE THE BOSS SAYS THEY DON'T LOOK PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH BECAUSE THE BOSSES THEY DIDN'T GET THERE WHEN THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY DIDN'T. HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE LITERALLY. ALMOST EVERY REASON EXCEPT THOSE PROHIBITED BY LAW WHICH ARE ABOUT SIX SO -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENCOURAGE WORKERS TO COME FORWARD. IN ALMOST EVERY CASE AND YOU WILL HEAR THEM DAY AFTER DAY. ONE WOMAN IS NOT THE ONLY VICTIM BUT IF WOMEN ARE SCARED URBAN WOMEN OR MEN ARE SCARED TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT RETALIATION IT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE WIDESPREAD PERVASIVE ONGOING. AND PROTECTIVE USERS THE POINT HERE IS THAT A WORKER SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD OF COURSE IF THEY HAVE LEGITIMATELY DONE SOMETHING WRONG THEY CAN BE FIRED THAT'S WHY THE PRESUMPTION IS REBUTTABLE. THE BURDEN IS ON THE PERSON WITH POWER THE EMPLOYER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING BAD THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND I MIGHT INDICATE THAT WE DO HAVE FORM PAGES.

MACHINISTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS THE AMENDED VERSION THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKEN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS IN MINUTES PLEASE THAT HAVE BEEN COMING UP THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY POSED TO THE BILL. AT WE DO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS WE WE THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS -- BUT WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN YOU KNOW WE WERE JUST FUN REALLY CONCERNED WITH -- AS STATUTORY SALAS MEN OF REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. AGAINST OF LIABILITY AGAINST EMPLOYERS THERE'S A FEW EXAMPLES IN THE CODE ALREADY BUT WE TRADITIONALLY OPPOSED STATUTORILY CREATING -- PRESUMPTIONS OF LIABILITY. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT LAST YEAR'S AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE HAD A THIRTY DAY. REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AND THAT BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR THIS BILL HAS A NINETY DAY REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION SO IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN LAST YEAR'S BILL. OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN THOUGH IS WITH THE CREATION OF OR THE INCORPORATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW INTO THE LABOR CODE. WE THINK SUCH HARASSMENT IS A BODY OF LAW IS IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE -- IT MINISTER THAN ENFORCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND WE HAVE CONCERNS WHEN YOU PUT ALL ENTIRE BODY OF LAW INTO THE LABOR CODE. ENFORCED BY DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S GONNA RESULT AN INCONSISTENCY -- AND CONFUSION. THE PREVIOUS BILL WE SPOKE ABOUT WAS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT MEASURE THAT BILL AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED WAS CONTAINED IN FIFA THIS INCORPORATES SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROVISIONS INTO THE LABOR CODE. WHICH WE THINK IS INAPPROPRIATE. AT LAST YEAR'S BILL AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE ATTEMPTED TO ADD THE SAME PROVISIONS TO THE LABOR CODE. AND THE GOVERNOR -- NOTED IN HIS VETO NILES -- MESSAGE MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE CONTAINING CURRENT LAW AREN'T AREN'T ARE THERE FOR UNNECESSARY -- AND ADDITIONALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AB FIVE SIXTY NINE ATTEMPTED TO ADD PROVISIONS TO THE LABOR CODE REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AS SUCH DISCRIMINATION OR SCREAM NATION CLAIMS ARE ALREADY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND THE GOVERNOR SIMILARLY VETO THAT BILL AND STATED I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS SHOULD REMAIN. WITH IT WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING -- SO FOR SIMILAR REASONS WE BELIEVE IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE THESE THESE PROVISIONS IN THE LABOR CODE AND THEN FINALLY IN PUTTING IT IN LABOR CODE YOU'VE OF COURSE RAISE THE SPECTER OF PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CLAIMS UNDER PAGA -- AND SO WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT -- THAT'S A NECESSARY FEE HOW ALREADY ALLOWS VICTIMS WHO ARE -- PREVAILED SEXUAL HARASSMENT RETALIATION SUITS TO THE PINK IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. DECLARATORY RELIEF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES SO WE DON'T SEE THE REASON TO CRANK LIKE A LIABILITY IN THE LABOR CUTTING FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POST THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE STEP FORWARD IF YOU WOULD NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON BROWN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

TO HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE POWER TO TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO CREATE A CULTURE SHIFT AROUND HERE AND CERTAINLY LAST YEAR WITH ME TO LEGISLATION AND I THINK WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO A TIGHT KNIT SO THAT IT'S LEGITIMATELY -- SIGNIFICANT AND BALANCED A AND NOW WE JUST HAVE TO ENFORCE IT OFF IN THE WORKPLACE SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS -- WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN LABOR -- PLEASE SIR CALL THE ROLL.

WHEN TREVOR WAS NINETEEN HE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE MEANWHILE A CIVIL ACTION WAS BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THE PRIEST FOR SEXUAL ABUSE OF ANOTHER BOY? TREVOR WAS STILL TRYING TO HEAL HIMSELF FROM THE SHAME AND ANGER AND LET ALONE GO TO COURT THREAD PROCESS AT THAT TIME. THE PRIESTS WHO SEXUALLY ABUSE TREVOR NEVER WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HE DID TO TREVOR BECAUSE TREVOR DIED. BEFORE THE CASE COULD BE COMPLETELY DEAD TRAGICALLY THE STORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THOSE IN POWER NEW OF THE RISK AND PUT CHILDREN IN DANGER ANYWAY IS ALL TOO COMMON -- WE KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WE KNOW THIS KIT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM TO PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I RESPECTFULLY I'M I'M HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE TODAY AND WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO JUSTICE TO ALL THE VICTIMS STORIES.

AS A TEENAGER I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY THE CHOIR DIRECTOR AT MY HIGH SCHOOL IN SANTA ANA. HE DELIBERATELY TARGETED ME BECAUSE I WAS VULNERABLE. HE KNEW I WAS POWERLESS. I HAD SPENT TIME IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR SUICIDE ATTEMPT. MY MOTHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC MY FATHER WAS IN DENIAL. I YEARNED FOR MENTORSHIP AND A STRONG ADULT FIGURE IN MY LIFE. I DID NOT YOU'RE IN FOR AN ADULT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ME. DURING THE TWO YEARS HE TARGETED ME I WAS THE SUBJECT OF REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE ON SCHOOL PROPERTY IN ELSEWHERE. BY THE TIME I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL I WAS PREGNANT AND HAD A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE. UNLIKE MOST VICTIMS I LIVE WITH CRIPPLING SHAME AND SECRECY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. I'M NOT A FAMOUS PERSON.

MY NAME IS MARK PERRIN'S I'M HERE TODAY APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN TORT REFORM ASSOCIATION. ADDRESS A BROAD BASED COALITION. OF SMALL LARGE COMPANIES ASSOCIATIONS NON PROFITS MUNICIPALITIES. THAT SEEK FAIRNESS AND PREDICTABILITY IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AFTER SUPPORTS PROTECTING CHILDREN AND PUNISHING CRIMINAL WRONGDOING. AND SAID WHY SEXUAL ABUSE OF ANYBODY ESPECIALLY CHILD.

AS ADDRESSES ITS DIVERSE MEMBERSHIPS ONOFRE MY REMARKS TODAY IN A BROADER CONTEXT AND THEN DISCUSS WHY. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHTEEN IS EXTREME EVEN COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE WHEN THEY'VE MADE CHANGES TO THEIR STATURE LIMITATIONS. FOR CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE CASES. BY ITS NATURE TORT LITIGATION AND OFTEN INVOLVES PEOPLE WHO DESERVE OUR EMPATHY -- YEARS HEARD A VERY COMPELLING STORY. IT'S HARD. FOR YOUR HEART NOT TO GO OUT TO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT CERTAINLY DESERVE OUR EMPATHY. AND OUR EAR. SO IT IS A WOMAN WHO SUFFERS. A REPRODUCTIVE HARM FROM A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. AN ELDERLY VETERANS WHO DIES IMMEDIATELY ALMA FROM ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. OUR PERSON WHO'S RENDERED QUADRIPLEGIC ARTIST HAS DISFIGURING BURNS AS A RESULT OF ANOTHER'S NEGLIGENT OPERATION. OF A MOTOR VEHICLE. BEING A TORT LAWYER I'VE SEEN ALL OF THESE TYPES. OF CONDITIONS AND YET FOR ALL OF THESE TYPES OF CASES NOT WITHSTANDING THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY SUFFERED BY THOSE INVOLVED. WE HAVE A RULE OF LAW. WE HAVE A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THAT DOES SET TIME LIMITS ON THE FILING LAWSUITS. AS FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN EXPLAINING VETOING LEGISLATION SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THIS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. ALL JURISDICTIONS HAVE SEEN FIT TO BAR ACTIONS AFTER ALAPSE OF YEARS. THE REASON FOR THIS PART UNIVERSAL PRACTICE IS OF FAIRNESS. THERE COMES A TIME WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE SECURE. IN THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT PASSED TAX ARE INDEED IN THE PAST AND NOT SUBJECT TO FURTHER LAWSUIT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FAITH BORDERS WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB. TWO EIGHTEEN UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO INCLUDE AGGRESSIVE EFFECTIVE PREVENTION MEASURES TO ACCOMPANY ROBUST AND FAIR VICTIM COMPENSATION WE APPLY THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUALLY CREATING. A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL CHILDREN WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF PERPETRATORS I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR FAIR VICTIM COMPENSATION. AB TWO EIGHTEEN IS WRITTEN IS DOING MORE HARM BY CREATING STRICT LIABILITY FOR SCHOOLS REGARDLESS OF KNOWLEDGE. OF ORDER REASONABLE STEPS TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD CHILDREN FORCING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PAYMENTS FROM TODAY'S SCHOOLS FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE NO FISCAL RESERVES THAT WERE THE RESULT OF EMPLOYEES AND ADMINISTRATORS LONG GONE. INCREASING LITIGATION COSTS BY FOR THREE YEARS ALLOWING THE RE OPENING OF ALL TIME BARRED CASES TO BE ISSUED. AWARDS THAT NOW INCLUDE TRIPLE DAMAGES FOR COVER UPS WITH ATTORNEYS COLLECTING 4260% OF SETTLEMENTS. LIMITING NEEDED ACCESS AND REINSURANCE OPTIONS THROUGH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RATES HEART CAPS EXCLUSIONS LIMITS ON COVERAGE AND STRICTER UNDERWRITING POTENTIALLY LEAVING STUDENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT COVERAGE AND EXPOSED TO THE DIRECT COST OF THESE CLAIMS. RISK POOLING JBS ARE NOT INSURANCE THEIR SELF FUNDED TO FILL THE GAPS IN LIABILITY THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T COVER AND THEY'RE NONPROFIT PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT PAY FOR THE COST OF CLAIMS TO SCHOOL BUDGETS AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THESE GPAS SERVER THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAVE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHEN MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES OR IT WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND PROVIDED VERY LITTLE ESSENTIAL COVERAGE WERE HEADED TOWARDS THAT STEAM ENVIRONMENT NOW AND WE MAY SOON FIND THAT OUR SCHOOLS. ARE LEFT WITHOUT ESSENTIAL COVERAGE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE. AB TWO EIGHTEEN WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EMPLOYERS TO EFFECTIVELY DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS THAT ARE DECADES OLD WHEN EVIDENCE IS LIKELY GONE WITNESSES HAVE MOVED -- PASSED AWAY AND THERE'S BEEN A TURNOVER IN STAFF THE REALITY IS A DIVERSION OF FUNDING INTENDED FOR EDUCATION. FOR THE STUDENTS AND SERVING COMMUNITIES TO FINANCIALLY INCREASED LEGAL COSTS WHETHER OR NOT THE CLAIM IS VALID. A FUTURE A CHILD'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND ON A GOOD EDUCATION PLEASE OPPOSE THE SPELL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO ENSURE BOTH.

ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS -- LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THIS IS THIS IS PRETTY DRACONIAN [inaudible] BUT YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LISTENING I WAS THINKING THAT OF THE CASE OF THE YOUNG BOY WHO. HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED AND ULTIMATELY -- ENDED HIS LIFE. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY STORES I'VE HEARD OF YOUNG -- YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO THIS DAY AND HOPEFULLY WON'T END UP DOING THAT BUT THE? THE INCIDENCE OF THIS KIND OF ABUSE IS TRUST. HARD TO GET ONE'S ARMS AROUND IT IS JUST -- IT'S TRAGIC AND THAT'S ABOUT AS MILD THE WORDS I CAN USE AND SO -- I THINK WE ARE AND WE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO EXPAND STATURE TO LIMITATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A REASON THAT WE HAVE THEM. THINGS ARE FRESHER IN PEOPLE'S MINDS TO TETRA BUT WE DO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THIS KIND OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE. THAT PEOPLE TEND TO TRY TO BURY IT DEEP UNTIL SOMETHING AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT. OR WHY OR HOW IT'S INVOKED AGAIN. ARE THEY OUT OF THE EFFORT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS REALLY DOES REQUIRE THAT WE PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THESE VICTIMS -- I KNOW THE CONCERNS AND I HAVE DISCUSSES WITH MY OWN SCHOOL A COMMUNITY THAT THAT SHARES THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY ABOUT THE COSTS -- AND THE FACT THAT THE OSTENSIBLY THERE'S REALLY NOTHING HERE TO DO PREVENTION I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF BILLS OUT THERE WE JUST HEARD A COUPLE -- I KNOW I'VE DONE SOME HOPEFULLY THERE IS A LOT OF PREVENTION OUT THERE AND IF THE SCHOOLS DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT YET GO BACK AND READ ALL THE VARIOUS. LAWS THAT WE PUT INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR -- AND OVER THE COURSE OF TIME TO DEAL WITH PREVENTION THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR CANNOT BE TOLERATED SO -- THE THE LENGTH OF THE LIMITATIONS PERIOD I WOULD NOTE -- THE CONNECTICUT PROVIDES. NEARLY AN ADDITIONAL DECADE BEYOND -- TO WHAT IS SET BY THIS BILL AND THAT MASSACHUSETTS EVEN MORE. ARE CLEARLY MAKING A POLICY DETERMINATION THAT THE AGREE JUST US I THINK OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE THE ATTORNEY COMING IN REFERENCING ALL THE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME. AND REDRESS GRIEVANCES -- FOR FOR BEHAVIOR AND AND NEGLIGENCE AND INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF OF HARMON DISTRESS -- BUT THE EGREGIOUS NOUS OF THESE ACTS SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH THAT FROM SOME OF THESE OTHER INSTANCES SO. WITH THAT I THINK WAS A GENTLEMAN BACK THERE WHO -- INDICATED THE ENLISTED SOME OF THE THE LITANY OF ISSUES WHERE NOW I GUESS IT WAS YOU SIR -- AND THEIR THEIR SIGNIFICANT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE IN GOING FORWARD WITH THAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE [inaudible] ON WE HAVE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR OPENING OF STATUES LIMITATIONS. THIS I'M COMMUTE. DIRECTLY -- EXPLAINED TO ME WE HAVE THE EMPLOYER WHO KNEW AND THAT'S SEEMS TO CLEAR JUSTIFICATION IN AND SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IN THE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. LEGAL THEORY IS RATHER NEW TESTS THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO SEXUAL ASSAULT THIS IS NOT BATTERY DISS ASSAULT. THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HOW. THERE HAS TO BE A WRONG FOR NEGLIGENT ACT AND SO OBVIOUSLY TIME MAKES THESE CLAIMS HARD BUT IT MAKES IT HARD ON THE PLAINTIFF HAS WELL I MEAN THE PLAINTIFF HAS TO THERE'S NO PRESUMPTION HERE. PLAINTIFF HAS TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS A NEGLIGENT OR WRONGFUL ACT -- THAT THAT FORCE THE INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE KNOWN -- THE CASES WE'VE SEEN -- IT'S IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IT'S FIVE GIRLS COMING IN ABOUT THE SAME GYM TEACHER THAT DID THE SAME -- INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS TOWARDS THEM THAT THAT'S AS CLEAR AS IT CAN BE -- OBVIOUSLY I IT RELIES ON EVIDENCE NOT EVIDENCE IF IT'S ESPECIALLY OLD IS GONNA BE HARD TO COME BY BUT IT'S THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAS TO PROVE THE CASE NOT THE DEFENDANT. ON MANTRA JUST I'M JUST SAYING THE STANDARD OF PROOF THIRTY YEARS AGO WASN'T THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN I MEAN IT WAS IF YOU DO GET THE LIABILITY I I CAN SEE THAT. THE PROOF PROBLEMS BUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WAS NOT. ARE YOU WEREN'T LIABLE FOR YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN -- IF YOU WERE NEGLIGENT IS A THEORY. I'M IN THE SALT I MEAN BECAUSE AGAIN IT WAS JUST. IT MIGHT BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A BAD SEXUAL BATTERY AND THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. SO FOR THE EMPLOYERS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD SO THE FIRST TIME THAT THAN ANYTHING CHANGED AND THAT. WAS A AND SB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE BILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT GENERALLY ANY NEGLIGENCE. CAN BE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN GOING BACK. I ASK BECAUSE IN THE BILL. THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING A SENATOR WHAT CASKEY. THE REVIVAL THE THE STANDARD ONE YEAR REVIVAL VERSUS THE THREE YEAR REVIVAL -- I DON'T REMEMBER LAST YEAR'S BILL I'M I AN ACT THAT IF THEY HAD THE THREE YEAR REVIVAL I THOUGHT THEY DID OKAY SO THAT THE REGIONAL BELL HAD A ONE YEAR REVIVAL AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND -- SINCE AND IS THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY A IN A YEAR SOMEBODY EVEN WHO HAS COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT THIS HAPPENED -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLAIMS YOU'LL SEE -- GIVE AN EXTRA IT IS SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHURCH A LACK OF PLAINTIFFS WHO WERE A SPANISH SPEAKING THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT I MEAN THAT BY THE TIME IT ACTUALLY GETS TO POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS -- THE UNDERSTANDING COMING TO TERMS WITH THAT ONE YEAR WAS PRIOR TO ALL OF THE MEDIA ATTENTION THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE SUBJECTS SENSE AS SPOTLIGHT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WITH THAT WE'VE SEEN WE WERE. WE LET IT SO QUICKLY -- THAT THAT ONE YEAR REALLY DIDN'T PROVIDE A A NUMBER OF THE VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD AND AND RECOGNIZE AND BE ABLE. TO ACCESS JUSTICE. MANAGER FACT BECAUSE THIS REDUCES. TALK ABOUT WE SHOULD BE VERY STINGY IS LEGISLATORS ABOUT OPENING UP THE STATUE LIMITATIONS AND BE VERY NARROW SO WISTER EVIDENCE I MEAN I GET YOU AYE WHEN YOUR WINDOW IT'S WHEN YOU'RE WHEN THERE WAS FOR EVIDENCE THAT SAID. THE DO YOU FOUNDER HIT THE OTHER REPORTS HAVE SAID THAT. IT HAPPENS AT FOURTEEN MONTHS OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I REALIZE WE GIVE EVERYBODY MORE TIME THERE'S MORE LAWSUITS THAT'S WELL IN WAR WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING EVERY DAY MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE FACT THAT WHAT IT. WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY COME TO TERMS WITH -- THAT HAVING HAPPENED AND SO AS IT YOU KNOW EXPOSURE ACCEPTANCE -- AND AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS -- TO ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE CHURCH I HEY I'M NOT THIS ISN'T A CHURCH BELL BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT OUR BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE IN THE CHURCH -- YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO FIRST COME TO TERMS -- WITH WHY THEIR LIFE IS FALLING APART. AND COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT ADMITTING TO THEMSELVES THAT THIS HAPPENED ADMITTING TO A A PROFESSIONAL THAT THIS HAPPENED -- COMING TO TERMS WITH THEIR CHURCH THEIR FAMILY AND SEEKING OUT AN ATTORNEY AND FILING A LAWSUIT -- THAT MAY SEEM LIKE -- YOU COULD DO THAT IN A YEAR OR WHEN WE COMPARED AGAINST OTHER TOWARDS. WELL YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE STATURE LIMITATIONS WE HAVE THESE RULES BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SEX CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT AS IT IS DIFFERENT THE WAY PEOPLE DEAL WITH IT IS DIFFERENT. AND AND LESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VICTIMS THEMSELVES I I THINK IT'S HARD. TO TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY COULD. COMPLETELY. AT BARRY DOT FROM EVEN THEMSELVESAND AND AND NOT BE ABLE TO AT EVER SPEAK THOSE WORDS -- AND THEN COME ABOUT AS LIFE HAS CHANGED AND OUR ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS CHANGED TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD. THIS IS ANOTHER WORDS THIS IS A UNIQUE CASE THAT FOLLOW AT RKO. WORRIED OF WILL ACCEPT THAT AS YOUR CLOSES THEIR MOTION. SO MOVED MADAM SECRETARY -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS.

AND THEY WERE IN THE WITHHOLD THOSE DOCUMENTS AND AND OFTEN TELL -- AND IMMIGRANT THAT THEY CAN'T TRAVEL FREELY AROUND BECAUSE OF IT WE ALSO HAVE INDICATIONS OF WHEN I'M AN EMPLOYER FORCES. IN IMMIGRANT TO LIVE IN A CERTAIN SPOT IN ORDER TO CONTROL ALL THEIR MOTIONS AND THIS WOULD JUST ENSURE THAT -- AS BASICALLY A FEDERALIZED IMPLEMENT IN STATE LAW SO THAT IT BECOMES A LAW THAT OUR OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CAN -- CAN GO OUT AND PURSUE AND ENSURE THAT. BASICALLY THIS THIS KIND OF A MODERN DAY SLAVERY AS AND IT DOESN'T CONTINUE. THE HEAD THANK YOU. TWO MINUTES PLEASE MORNING MADAM CHAIR SENATORS MY NAME'S MARTIN DOYLE AND I'M IT. DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM AND AND THE CITATIONS THE STUDIES ARE ARE VERY ADEQUATE. AS A PROTECT PRACTITIONER I ONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS NOT TO PUT IT IF. AND HOW THIS WOULD APPLY IN OUR COURTS. WE HAVE A LABOR TRAFFICKING STATUTE AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE -- WHERE WE PUNISH EGREGIOUS CONDUCT WHERE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL DEPRIVATION OF HUMAN LIBERTY WITH LENGTHY PRISON TERMS OF FIVE TO TWELVE YEARS THIS WOULD CREATE A MISDEMEANOR WITH THE CIVIL ABATEMENT SCHEME AND A HALF THE CIVIL PENALTY? FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO READ TEN SOMEBODY'S DOCUMENTS WITH THE INTENT. TO DEPRIVE THEM OF ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE UNDER OUR STATE LAW THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE OF FEDERAL LAW. AND WHY IT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN DISCOURAGING THAT PRACTICE. OF WE THINK THAT AS BEING MODERN PROSECUTORS IT IS NOT JUST OUR JOB TO TO TERROR AND ABATE THIS CONDUCT BUT ALSO TO EDUCATE. AND THAT'S WHY THE WORKER BILL OF RIGHTS IS INCLUDED IN HERE WHEN SOMEBODY ENTERS INTO AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR BOTH PARTIES TO BE ADVISED OF THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THAT CONTRACT. AND THAT PART OF THE BILL I THINK WE'LL DO THAT. THAT'S WHY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE URGES YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD PLEASE.

ARENA -- THAT THE PEOPLE GET HIT THAT THAT WOULD SOMEHOW BE -- COMMUNICATED TO THE TO THE BAR SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT THE IMPACT THAT THIS. ARE THE BEST PRACTICES.

I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL BUT JUST JUST THE THOUGHT THAT -- FOLKS WHO WERE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW UP A LOT OF TIMES IF IS UNLAWFUL DETAINER GOVERNOR'S BANKRUPTCY IF THERE'S SHALL SUPPORT WHATEVER. WHATEVER THE ISSUES ARE TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE FEARFUL AND YOU COULD SUBJECT YOURSELF.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BEFORE EIGHTEEN ONCE AGAIN. A TO THE COMMITTEE OF COURSE I DID PREVIOUSLY PRESENT ON THIS WILL LIKE. TO GIVE A BRIEF. PRESENTATION AB FOR EIGHTEEN WILL EXTEND THE EVIDENCE FOR PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES. AND THEIR UNION AGENT REPRESENTATIVE WHICH IS CRITICAL IN TODAY'S WORKING WORLD TO ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN A WORKER AND HIS OR HER YOU UNION AGENT REMAINS CONFIDENTIAL. UNION OF OR SORRY PRIVILEGES AN EXCLUSIONARY RULE OF EVIDENCE THAT PROTECTS CERTAIN CLASS OF INDICATIONS FROM DISCLOSURE TO OPPOSING PARTIES FROM ENTRY INTO EVIDENCE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE RATIONALE IS THAT ALTHOUGH CERTAIN INFORMATION MAY BE RELEVANT IT IS NONETHELESS EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF OVER WRITING SOCIAL INTERESTS. IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING. THERE OR CONCERNS RACE WHICH I BELIEVE THESE A MAN'S HELP TO ADDRESS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS WORK ON THIS AS WELL AS WORKING WITH MY STAFF FROM WITH OUR SPONSOR. I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS AROUND THE TOPICS EDUCATIONAL TRAINING FOR PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS UNTIL REPRESENTATIONS. REGARDING TRAINING UNION AGENTS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED BOTH THE LEGALITIES AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND THE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS THIS INCLUDES HOW TO SERVE. REPRESENT AND HANDLE SENSITIVE GRIEVANCES. THIS PROPOSAL BECOME A REGULAR PART OF THESE EFFORTS. REGARDING DAHLE REPRESENTATION IN CASES WHERE A GRIEVANCE MAN VOTE TO SEPARATE EMPLOYEES IS A STANDARD OR PRO PRACTICE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE IS ASSIGNED A SEPARATE UNION REPRESENTATIVE. TO ENSURE THERE'S NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THE BEST INTERESTS OF BOTH A REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALLY. IN ADDITION THIS IS THE THIS POLICY -- THIS PRIVILEGE IS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED ILLINOIS AND MARYLAND WHICH IS HELP TO FURTHER PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS. BY ALLOWING EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE TO WORKERS AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES WE CAN HELP TO ENSURE THAT WORKER RIGHTS ARE NOT UNDERMINED. ME IN SUPPORT IS TONY SINGLE. A LABOR ATTORNEY AT PROCTOR SINGLE AND GREEN STONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH OF YOU WOULD BETTER JOB REPAIR BIRDS WERE JUST INTRODUCING OUR GENERAL COUNSEL MY NAME IS BRIAN NELSON FROM THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE. COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WE'RE PLEASED TO BE ONE OF THE MANY LABOR CO SPONSORS OF THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- AND WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TONY SINGLE FROM AUTHOR FIGURING THANK YOU TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD SIR. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I WASN'T WITH YOU LAST TIME -- I I I WANNA MAKE THREE QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE LABOR PRACTITIONER WHOSE PRACTICE IT INTO WITH THESE ISSUES LITIGATED THESE ISSUES MANY TIMES. MOST UNIONS PROVIDE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION THROUGH NON ATTORNEYS. THEY USE ELECTED OFFICERS OR BUSINESS STAFF REPRESENTATIVE SOME OF THE FINEST ADVOCATES -- I'VE KNOWN ARE NON UNION LADY UNION REPRESENTATIVES THAT REPRESENT EMPLOYEES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SETTINGS GRIEVANCES UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE HEARINGS AND DUE PROCESS HEARINGS. OF MANY DIFFERENT TYPES THE REPRESENTATION IS GOVERNED. BY LEGAL RULES AND OBLIGATIONS A LEGAL DOCTRINE KNOWN AS THE DUTY. OF FAIR REPRESENTATION. BUT UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS ANY ABILITY. TO ENGAGE IN PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE EMPLOYEES THEY ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO REPRESENT. THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH SUCH CASE PREPARATION INVOLVES FREQUENTLY CONFIDENTIAL FAX IN STRATEGIC CONCERNS. OF YOU KNOW A AND R. SUCH THAT THE REPRESENTED MEMBER REASONABLY BELIEVES THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL. TWENTY TWO THIS IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE REPRESENTED BY ATTORNEYS. IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THERE'S CITY ATTORNEYS AND COUNTY COUNCILS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- THAT THERE ARE MANAGEMENT LAWYERS UNION BUSINESS AGENTS HANDLE CASES AGAINST EMPLOYER ATTORNEYS ALL THE TIME. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT ONLY ONE SIDE HAS THE PAIR HAS HAS THE ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR THE HEARING THROUGH CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. FINALLY BRIEFLY THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT THIS BILL WOULD INHIBIT WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS. THIS IS A COMPLETE RED HERRING. AB FOR EIGHTEEN ONLY PROTECTS CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU PREVENT THE DISCLOSURE OF FACTS OR PREVENT AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE FAX THINKING WE ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU TO STEP FORWARD YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. SEPTEMBER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS HAD BEEN HUTCHINGS WITH REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I KNOW. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE DISCUSSED THIS MEASURE THERE IS OUR BEST -- CONVERSATION FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BRING UP SEVERAL -- ISSUES -- WITH THE BILL NONE OF WHICH HAVE BEEN -- REALLY DIRECTLY RESOLVED IN A LANGUAGE THAT IS PRESENTED TODAY -- THEY'RE STILL A CONFLICT BETWEEN UNION MEMBERS AND BETWEEN THE BARGAINING UNIT AND THE GROUP AS A WHOLE WHAT WAS WHAT WAS STATED -- BY THE FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE -- I I ABOUT THE IDEA TO DO TO DO THE A REPRESENTATIVE FOR REPRESENTATION THAT IS. OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS MEASURE -- THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE ISSUES REGARDING PROPER TRAINING CERTIFICATION -- LICENSING REQUIREMENTS -- THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SANCTIONS OR BY FOR VIOLATION OF SAID PRIVILEGE -- THE AND YOU KNOW IT AS THE AS A GOVERNOR BROWN INDICATED IN HIS VETO MESSAGE IN WEEKS CONTINUED TO AGREE. THIS WOULD STILL INHIBIT THE ABILITY FOR A PUBLICATION SEE TO CONDUCT ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS AND SO -- THE WITH THAT WE WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IT AFTER YOU MADAM CHAIR LET MEMBERS LEASE OVER THERE WITH CAL CHAMBER. THERE ARE SEVERAL PRIMARY ISSUES AS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES MANY OF WHICH WERE REYES THE LAST TIME THE COMMITTEE HEARD THIS BILL. THE FIRST IS UNLIKE THE OTHER PRIVILEGES BOTH UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND THE EMPLOYEE HERE ARE THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED ATTORNEY OR PHYSICIAN PRIVILEGES THE CLIENTS USE THAT ATTORNEY OR DOCTOR HOWEVER HERE THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE CAN DISCLOSE WHERE IT SEES FIT. IN ANY LAWSUIT WEAVING THE EMPLOYEES EXPECTED PRIVILEGES DISS STATED INTENT OF THE BILL NO AMENDMENTS WERE MADE ON THIS ISSUE AFTER THE LAST COMMITTEE. THIS IS RELATED TO THE SECOND POINT IN THAT THERE'S NO PROVISION FOR HOW TO POLICE THIS PRIVILEGE FOR LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED THEY CAN BE HOLDEN TO BEFORE COURT. OR BEFORE REGULATORY BODY IF THEY VIOLATE THE PRIVILEGE AT MINIMUM IF THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE WILL ALSO BE THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE THERE MUST BE SOME A MECHANISM FOR PROTECTION AGAINST VIOLATING THE EXPECTATIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY. NO AMENDMENTS WERE MADE ON THE BILL SINCE THE LAST COMMITTEE RAISE THIS ISSUE. THE ONLY A MOMENT MADE AFTER THE LAST IMPORTANT DEBATE IS COMMITTEE WAS UNRELATED TO THESE ISSUES IT IS TRUE THAT THE PRIVILEGE ULTIMATELY APPLIES IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING HOWEVER PARTIES TO A PRIVILEGE MUST CONTINUALLY ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE IT. FOR THE ULTIMATE LITIGATION. THE AMENDMENTS MADE NOT CHANGES ISSUE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE PROPONENTS THE POLICIES THAT WERE CITED TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARE NOT CODIFIED IN THIS BILL. IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE MOST OF THE PRIVILEGE IS CURRENTLY IN STATURE THE RESULT OF DECADES OF COURT INTERPRETATION WHICH A THAN CODIFIED INTO STATUTE. THERE IS A REASON THE OTHER PRIVILEGES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO SIMILAR AND IT'S CONCERNING THAT THIS PRIVILEGE AND AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS LACKING IN SIMILARITIES. THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT WITHOUT AMENDMENTS TO AT LEAST ADDRESS THESE MERRICK MAJOR POLICY CONCERNS IT WILL TAKE DECADES OF LITIGATION FOR CALIFORNIA COACH COURTS TO ESTABLISH TE PROPER SCOPE. EXTENT AND REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS PRIVILEGE FOR THESE REASONS OTHERS CAL CHAMBER CONTINUES TO OPPOSE IT BEFORE. EIGHTEEN THANK YOU. YOU KNOW FOR THOSE OF ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV FOR MEDICATIONS AND THEY RUN THEM THROUGH VERY QUICKLY SO THEY CAN GET IN ALL THEIR DISCLAIMERS. YOU SHOULD UP FOR THAT BECAUSE I ONLY GOT TO MARRY IMPRESSIVE. ALL RIGHT -- OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. VIEW COULD COME FORWARD PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JEAN HEARSE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA CESSATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AFTERNOON JEFF NEAL WITH CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO POSED THANK YOU. AND I'M SURE MIKE BELOW COULD PASSABLE JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK GOD I WAS ASKED TO ALSO REGISTRADAS ISSUE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THERE ARE UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALRIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SEEING NO OTHER SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI -- MANAGER I'M LOOKING AT THAT SECTION ONE FORTY EIGHT IS UNDER ARTICLE NINE POINT FIVE UNION AGENT SLASH REPRESENTED PURPOSE WORKER IN THIS THIS IS THE LAST SENTENCE IN SUBSECTION A BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE S. THIS TALISMAN OF THE HEAD. COMMUNICATIONS AS A REPRESENTATIVE EMPLOYEE OR REPRESENT A FORMER EMPLOYEE ALSO HAS A PRIVILEGE TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON. FROM DISCLOSING IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH A PROCEEDING A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THAT EMPLOYEE AND THE UNION AGENT THAT IS PRIVILEGE PURSUANT TO THE SECTION. WHO'S THAT OTHER PERSON THE OTHER PERSON. I'M SORRY THE OTHER PERSON IS SOMEBODY WITHIN THE PRIVILEGE. IT IT COULD BE THAT THE PRIVILEGE WAS MADE -- TO UNION REPRESENTATIVES IT COULD BE THAT THERE WAS A CLERICAL PERSON INVOLVED IN FORWARD IN AN EMAIL. IT THIS THIS SAME DOCTRINE EXIST IN THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHERE DISCLOSURE TO CERTAIN OTHERS DON'T DON'T WAVE PRIVILEGE AND IT TRACKS WITH THAT LANGUAGE PARDON IT TRACKS WITH THAT LANGUAGE IS A TUNING IS IT. WHEN I READ IT GIVEN THAT? QUESTIONS WE HAVE LAST TIME IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A BREACH OF THE PRIVILEGE OR OR BREACH OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CONFIDENCE THAT NORMALLY WOULD. EVAPORATE THE PRIVILEGE SO IT HAS TO BE ANOTHER PERSON WITH YOU TALKING A TRANSLATOR EMPLOYEE SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO'S. WITH THAT -- QUESTION THAT I HAD ON THE DIS INTERESTED NESS BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PRIVILEGES THAT WE HAPPEN AND WE HAVE A DISINTERESTED DOCTOR PATIENT AND ABUSE COUNSELOR THIS IS THIS. JOINT PRIVILEGE IS HOW BY BY PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT HAVE A DISINTEREST IN PRESERVE PERVERT. PRESERVING THE PRIVILEGE -- AND I'M WONDERING WHAT SAFEGUARDS WE HAVE FOR THAT THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE MISUE. LET ME ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY THEY'RE THE PRIVILEGES HELD BY BOTH THE UNION -- AND THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE. IN AN ATTORNEY CLIENT. SITUATION BE ATTORNEY HAS ONE CLIENT AND THERE'S A PRIVILEGE AND THE CLIENT IS THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE. IN A UNION SITUATION IT IS VERY FREQUENT THAT UNIONS REPRESENT THE COLLECTIVE. THEY MAD THEY MAY INVESTIGATE. GRIEVANCES AND HAVE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. BUT THE UNION MADE. TO THE GRIEVANCE OR BREACH OF CONTRACT LAWSUIT. A IN ITS OWN RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY THEY WOULD THE THAT BOTH THE UNION AND THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE HAVE TO BE THE HOLDER. OF THE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE SOMETIMES. THE V. EMPLOYEE MAKING THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION ISN'T PART OF THE SUBSEQUENT LEGAL PROCEEDING. MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE NORMALLY WE WON ALL THAT INFORMATION TO GO BEFORE THE JUDGE IN BEFORE THE THE PERSON MAKING THAT DECISION YOU KNOW WE ARE STINGY ABOUT CARVING OUT. EVIDENCE THAT WE DON'T LET AND BECAUSE OF THE THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF IT SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THE UNION RAP. THEY COLLECT ALL THESE CONFIDENCES FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT THE MEAN I HAVE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE THEY COLLECT THEM -- I I GUESS HOW DO WE CONTROL THAT WHETHER THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU KNOW WE MONITOR IT OR OR POLICE IT. WILL BUT AGAIN IT GETS BACK TO THE DISTINCTION I MADE BEFORE ABOUT FAX. IN STRATEGY WHAT IS PRIVILEGED AS A STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION. BETWEEN THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND THE EMPLOYEE HOW TO PRESENT A CASE. WHAT THE FACTS ARE THE UNION HAS TO PASSED BRING FACTS FORWARD TO PROVE THE CASE AFTER THAT WHAT SHOULDN'T BE OPEN IS? IT IS THE ADVICE THE UNION REPRESENTATIVES ADVICE OR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION TO THE EMPLOYEE. THAT IS THAT VERY ANALOGOUS TO THE ATTORNEY SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER I MEAN THE ADVICE IS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A STRATEGY VERSUS SOME. WORKPLACE ACTIVITY THAT THERE'S TELLING A SECRET AND IN YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL EVEN THOUGH. IT MAY BE. FOR A BUT OTHER PUBLIC POLICY REASONS. DESIRABLE TO HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED TO THAT BECAUSE I SEE IT. AS A LAWYER WERE SORT OF LIMITED WHEN YOU DO DEFENSE WORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WHY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DISCLOSE THAT THAT PERSON AS SHE TRIED TO CREATE A DEFENSE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] SENATOR BORCHERS. FOLLOWING UP -- ON THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED OPPOSITION. OR CONCERNS IN THE LAST HEARING. SO WHAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIVELY CHANGED IN IN YOUR OPINION. FROM -- THE PEACE LEGISLATION THAT WE REVIEWED A COUPLE WEEKS BACK TO WHERE IT IS NOW. I'M SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- IT IN OUR ASSESSMENT THE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT THAT WAS ADOPTED WAS TO TRY AND CLARIFY THAT THIS THAT THIS PRIVILEGE -- APPLIES TO ONLY A A A PRECEDING BY THE THE PRECEDING THE DEFINITION OF OF OF PROCEEDING -- IN OUR IN OUR ASSESSMENT -- IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED THERE SOME AMBIGUITY APART FROM THAT. AT ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE MEMBERS% OF THE COMMITTEE WITH REGARDS TO TRAINING WITH REGARD TO CERTIFICATION AND I HOW YOU SERVE TWO MASTERS BEING THE BARGAINING UNIT IN THE EMPLOYEE NONE OF THOSE ISSUES -- WERE ADDRESSED -- BYE BYE THESE AMENDMENTS. OKAY -- I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED -- BEFORE OTHER THAN. AT A CURSORY LEVEL I THINK. PRIVILEGE IN OUR IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS NOR IS NORMALLY BEEN AFFORDED TO VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS. AND THOSE GO ABOUT WITH CERTIFICATION OF OUR TRAINING CONTINUING LEE -- EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL OR OR OR LEGAL. AND SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OLDER RELUCTANT TO EXPAND UPON THAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. ABSENT -- TRULY COMPELLING NEEDS. AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO CREATE A BROADER. A SET OF PROTECTIONS IN PRIVILEGES. THAT GO BEYOND WHAT ALREADY EXISTS BETWEEN A LAWYER AND CLIENT AND THE DOCTOR AND PATIENT PRIEST PENITENT -- I'M JUST TRYING TO I DON'T THINK I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE IS SUCH A COMPELLING NEED. THAT PRIVILEGE SHOULD EXIST ON THE SITUATION. AND THAT SHOULD BE HELD. ON BY BOTH SETS OF PARTIES -- AND WE'VE HEARD THE EXAMPLE OF THE LEGAL BUT ALSO ON TOP OF THE COULD THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST I THINK THE SATISFYING MULTIPLE INTERESTS. IS. COULD VERY WELL CREATE A CONE. OF INFORMATION. SO INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HELPING THE INDIVIDUALS. IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR THE COLLECTIVE AS A WHOLE I THINK IT IS PRONE TO CREATE A SILO. OF INFORMATION. AND THE CIRCULATION OF WHICH ROOM AND THE PROSPECT OF THAT REMAINS UNKNOWN AND FRANKLY THING DANGEROUS. WE'RE INFORMATION CAN BE HELD WITHIN A CONFINED ENVIRONMENT -- IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE -- I THINK THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A THERE WAS CONCERN AND HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT -- FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY WERE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT THINGS AND I FULLY APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD -- NOT ONE A LOOK BACK AND AT THE THE TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATIVE CYCLE AND I THINK THAT WE CREATED A NEW BRAND OF PRIVILEGE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A MATTER TIME. BEFORE THERE'S A MANAGEMENT IN EMPLOYEE REQUEST FOR PRIVILEGE. BETWEEN YOU KNOW UNCERTIFIED COUNSELORS IN THOSE WHO RECEIVE COUNSELING PRIVILEGE I MEAN THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD -- EMBARK UPON BECAUSE THEY WILL COME UP WITH COMPELLING REASONS NOT UNLIKE THE ONES THAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH -- IN THE COURSE OF OF THE DISCUSSION HERE -- I'M SORRY JUST WON'T BE IN A POSITION TO TO SUPPORT THIS AND I THINK IT IT WILL END UP BEING SOMETHING THAT WE REGRET. DOWN THE ROAD COURSE WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY HERE WE CALL A POLITELY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND IF THERE ARE ANY I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR TO RUSSELL. AND THEN FALL BY SENATOR UMBERG YES -- HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MY LIFE AROUND. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN WORK PLACES THAT HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER TO ME. ON THE PRACTICAL SIDE HERE YOU HAVE. EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE THAT THEY GO TO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. TO NEGOTIATE THEIR AGREEMENT THEIR WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND ALL THAT BUT ALSO TO GO TO THE UNION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS. AND TRY TO SOLVE ISSUES THAT COME UP. SOMETIMES OF THE EMPLOYER SOMETIMES WITH OTHER WITH CALM PLACE. IT'S A VERY PRACTICAL SIDE OF OF LIFE IN THE WORKPLACE TO BE ABLE TO SAY YEAH WHATEVER YOU SAY TO ME. DON'T WORRY IT'S NOT GONNA BE. FED OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO THAT WORKPLACE AND TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEONE TALK TO YOU UNION. AGENT AND BE ABLE -- TO HAVE THAT PROTECTION OF WHAT YOU SAY AND THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE WORKPLACE. THERE'S IT IS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EMPLOYER WITH MANAGERS WITH SUPERVISORS WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS AT STAKE HERE. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY PRACTICAL FIED. THAT NEEDS TO BE. UNDERSTOOD AS FAR AS WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PROTECT THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS SO. IT MAY BE TOO MUCH TO TRY TO GET BUT IT IS VERY SIMPLE YOU GO TO SOMEONE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CONFIDE IN THEM. ABOUT WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THE WORKPLACE YOU EXPECT THERE TO BE CONFIDENTIALITY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG -- I I THINK THIS IS A RATHER PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT TYPICALLY WHEN WE ACCORDING TO FORD -- SPECIAL STATUS OF PRIVILEGE USUALLY DOES COME WITH OTHER QUALIFICATIONS WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL TRAINING OR WHETHER SPECIAL STATUS WHATEVER IT MAY BE. AND THIS IS EVEN MORE UNUSUAL BECAUSE THE PRIVILEGE IS GOING TO BE HELD BY BOTH THE ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS BY THE INDIVIDUAL. AND EVEN MORE UNIQUE BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES THAT CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION I THINK IS AN OBLIGATION NOT JUST TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WHO'S COMMUNICATING BUT ALSO TO OTHERS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND I RAISE THIS BEFORE WITH RESPECT TO HARM TO OTHER CO WORKERS. IN SOME PLACES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAD A SPECIAL. RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNING HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OTHER STUDENTS THE SAME THING WITH RESPECT TO PSYCHIATRISTS MAYBE PSYCHOLOGIST BUT CERTAINLY PSYCHIATRISTS WHO HAVE A DUTY TO WARN I TALKED LAST TIME ABOUT PERHAPS. SOME SORT OF A DUTY I UNDERSTAND WHY -- IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNICATIONS AND REGARDING REGARDING NEGOTIATION THOSE KINDS OF INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT ALLOW THE OTHER SIDE BASICALLY GAIN ACCESS. BUT BUT AS I EXPRESSED CONCERN. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT. COMMUNICATIONS THAT REFLECT SOMEONE'S INTEREST IN PERHAPS DOING HARM TO ANOTHER COWORKER THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE IN THAT THAT PARTICULAR IN THIS CONTEXT. AND IT'S NOT UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE IT I MEAN IT DOES HAPPEN THE CO WORKERS BOTH HARASS AND AND COMMIT WRONGFUL ACCESS TO OTHER COWORKERS. AND SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT I PROPOSED -- A COUPLE DAYS AGO THEN AGAIN YESTERDAY WAS WAS STRIKING -- ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE BILL UNDER SECTION TEN FORTY EIGHT POINT -- TWO WHERE IT READS THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE UNDER THIS ARTICLE IF THE UNION AGENT REASON WE BELIEVE THAT. DISCLOSURE OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT A CRIMINAL ACT PERIOD IN STRIKING THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE SEC SENATOR. WITH AS A POLICY HERE WE DON'T NEGOTIATE AMENDMENTS. ARE DURING THE HEARING -- SO -- I KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT AMONG THE OTHER. CONCERNS HAD BEEN EXPRESSED IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE THAT HERE -- WILL WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH ON OUR PLATE TODAY AND SEVENTY BILLS NEXT WEEK SO AND HERE YEAH ALL I'M DOING IS I'M I'M ASKING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER IT IF THEY REJECTED IT. THEN THAT'S THAT'S MY QUESTION AND I'VE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD HE IF HE WOULD INDICATE THAT IN HIS CLOTHES BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A COLLOQUY ON IF IF YOU WOULD JUST GO AHEAD. AS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU WILL RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY -- SO -- LET'S GO AHEAD AND AND WE'LL HAVE HIM ANSWER THAT US IN HIS CLOTHES AND IT WITHOUT ANY. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WATER INTO. A WILL WILL LOOKS. ON THEM. EXCEPT THE MOTION IF THERE IS. ONE SO MOVED BY SENATOR ALSO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM JOURNAL ALL START OFF -- IF I COULD WITH THE THE QUESTIONS ON RUBBER THAT ABSOLUTELY WE'RE OPEN TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE -- AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU -- IT THIS BILL YES TO THE COMMITTEE -- TO GIVE TO THAT CONVERSATION SPECIFIC TO THAT REQUEST -- BUT I THINK IT'S A DEFICIT THAT WE CAN WORK ON TO BUT TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT THE THERE DEFINITELY IS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS DO WE BELIEVE THERE'S A ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CURRENT -- CONDITIONS WERE IN AND HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME -- IN TERMS OF THE WILLING AWAY OF WHAT WORKERS RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY. OF WORKERS TO BE PROPERLY REPRESENTED -- IS THERE AN OVERRIDING SOCIAL INTEREST TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD -- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- IN TO ENSURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAN JOSE WE HAVE CLOSE SESSION HEARINGS. OVER PERSONAL MATTERS OR UNION MATTERS ARE VOTING WHATEVER MIGHT BE. AND WE HAD OUR CITY ATTORNEY REPORT TO US AND I WAS ALL IN CONFIDENCE -- AND THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT POINT THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WORKERS DON'T HAVE EASY AND QUICK ACCESS TO A LAWYER BUT THEY DO HAVE ACCESS. TO THEIR UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT COMMUNICATION IS ONE THAT -- WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO WHETHER IT'S A SPECIAL ONE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED -- AND I THINK UNIONS ARE ACCUSTOMED REPRESENTING MANY MANY PEOPLE AND AND UNDERSTAND COMPLEX AND HOW TO RESOLVE THAT -- BUT AS IT APPLIES TO A PROTECTING A COMMUNICATIONS IN CIVIL ACTIONS I THINK THAT IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUE. AND ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE PROTECT ABOVE AND SO UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES I WOULD RAISE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOUGHT AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF AND AS WELL AS THE OTHER CENTERS WHO TOOK THE TIME BUDGET FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ABOUT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE A BEFORE EIGHTEEN JACKSON LIKE JACKSON AYE BORDERS. FOR JUST NO TO RUSSELL RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES. JONES NO MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN [inaudible] I'M BURKE. NUMBER OF IOWA CASKEY. WHITE HOUSE SKI I ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS. SIX SIXTY TWO WILL HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR THE APPS MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR A YOUR TESTIMONY HERE WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWO EIGHTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. BUT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WAITING JUST A MOMENT SHOWING CLEAR THE THE HALL IN THE NOISE RIGHT [inaudible] VERY GOOD. ON FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWO EIGHTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG THE FLOOR IS YOURS. BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. IS MY PLEASURE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHTY NINE WHICH IS STILL IN THE AUTHOR WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC REX RECORDS ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT EIGHT STATED ACCESS TO INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IS A FUNDAMENTAL AND NECESSARY RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON IN THIS STATE? CURRENTLY STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUBVERT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT BY CITING P. R. EXAMPLES EXEMPTIONS AS THE BASIS FOR DENYING A REQUEST. EVEN THOUGH THE EXEMPTIONS BAYSIDE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION. STATE AGENCIES ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE IS NO APPEAL OPTIONS OPTION OTHER THAN TO SUE THE AGENCY IN COURT WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE AND TOO COSTLY FOR MANY IN THE PUBLIC. AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING A BUT THE PERSON WHO CAN UPON. REQUEST A REVIEW THAT AND I'D PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND SERVE AS AN INDEPENDENT REFEREE. TO THE SIDE OF THE STATE AGENCY HEY LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR DENYING THE REQUEST. AB TWO EIGHTY NINE ADDRESSES A LOOPHOLE IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT PROCESS SILICON SO THAT IT CAN DO WHAT WAS INTENDED WHICH IS TO BRING TRANSPARENCY. FAIRNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO STATE GOVERNMENT FOR THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. NINETEEN OTHER STATES. HAVE ADOPTED SOME FORM OF INDEPENDENT REFEREE IN THIS CAPACITY AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO THE SAME WITH AB TWENTY NINE CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD. ON AN IMPORTANT BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO OUR GOVERNMENT. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IS SUPPORTED BY MAJOR MEDIA OUTLETS STATEWIDE SUCH AS THE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE. THE LA DAILY NEWS AND WE'VE ALSO RECEIVE EDITORIALS AND SUPPORT IN THE LA TIMES THE SIMPSONS CHRONICLE. THIS BILL IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS WITH ME E IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS WHEN HE PROUD THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS AS USUAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AT THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO REY ON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS A CRUCIAL TOOL TO DO THEIR JOBS REPORT THE NEWS. AS WE SEE IT. AB TWO EIGHTY NINE PROVIDES THREE KEY BENEFITS THAT FURTHER THE PURPOSES OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PUBLIC RECORDS IT'S IN TRYING. TO IN ARTICLE ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION FIRST IT HELPS REDUCE THE BURDEN ON THE JUDICIARY OF PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CASES IN SITUATIONS WHERE. A REQUEST -- USES THIS PROCESS THAT COULD BYPASS THE JUDICIARY AND RELIEVE THE CASE LOAD ON THE COURT. SECOND IT PROVIDES A REMEDY TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT A REQUEST -- WITHOUT MEANS MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE AS WE KNOW OUR RIGHT WITHOUT AND ACCESSIBLE REMEDY. IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE RIGHT AT ALL AND WHILE THE USE OF THE COURT SYSTEM CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ACCESSIBLE. TO A SMALL COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER OR AN INDIVIDUAL WATCHDOG. BY ADDING THIS ADDITIONAL TOOL INTO A REQUEST HERS TOOLBOX -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP FOR THE PURPOSES OF THAT RIGHT. AND FINALLY IT ALSO PROVIDES A BENEFIT EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T DIRECTLY UTILIZE THE PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE OPINIONS OF THESE THIS ON BUT THE PERSON WOULD BECOME PUBLIC AND BE COULD BE. USED AS GUIDANCE BOTH FOR A QUESTOR IS AS WELL AS PUBLIC AGENCIES IN THE FUTURE -- AND SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL AND ARE HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF IT TODAY. TWO OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SO I HAVE. A APPRECIATE -- TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. I TWO PAGES OF CONCERNS AND I THINK THEY ARE EXPRESSED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR APPEAL BY THE AGENCY AGAINST WHOM THE OR UPON WHOM THE REQUEST IS MADE SO -- THERE ARE -- IS I READ THIS IN AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS AND STAFF HAS ANALYZED IT -- I THINK THEY'RE JUST TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH I'D LIKE TO ARTICULATE -- BECAUSE WE HAVE GIVEN THIS A VERY SERIOUS LOOK AND WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND I BY NO SPEAKING FOR MYSELF FROM PROBABLY FOR EVERYONE HERE IS MANY OF US LAWYERS AND ALL. WE SUPPORT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WE DO NEED TO HAVE THAT SUNSHINE. BUT THIS BILL DRASTICALLY CHANGES HOW THE C. P. R. A. IS ENFORCED BY HAVING ONE INDIVIDUAL. MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF A RECORD IS DISCLOSED DOUBLE UNDER THE C. P. R. A. INSTEAD OF THE COURTS. WE'RE MOVING THE AUTHORITY THE JURISDICTION AWAY FROM THE COURTS THERE IS NO WAY. FOR A STATE AGENCY TO APPEAL THE DECISION OF THE ON BUDGET PERSON. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE STATE AGENCY CAN APPEAL A SUPERIOR COURT DECISION REGARDING THE CPR A THERE IS NO WAY A PERSON WHOSE INFORMATION IS IMPLICATED BY THE RECORDS. TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS. THE CONSEQUENCES HERE ARE GRAVE ONCE PRIVATE INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC IT CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK. IT CREATES A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF ENFORCING RIGHTS UNDER THE CPR A IT APPLIES EQUALLY TO STATE AGENCIES -- THE SIXERS WITH THE C. P. R. A APPLIES EQUALLY TO STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES BUT THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO STATE AGENCIES -- I WILL GO ON BECAUSE OR I CAN GO ON I GUESS I SHOULD SAY BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS -- LACK OF ABILITY FOR BOTH SIDES TO APPEAL -- STATE AGENCIES OR IT APPLIES TO THEM. THE EXISTING LAW MAKES DETERMINATIONS EXCLUSIVELY A JUDICIAL FUNCTION. WITH THE COURTS HAVE TO BALANCE TO FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY AND THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC ACCESS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE SYSTEM SET UP IS IT HOUSE. THE OMBUDSMAN PERSON IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE OR EVEN BE A LICENSED ATTORNEY. SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE BILL IS DOING IS THIS A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY OR NOT. IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S -- BOARDS PERSONS WE GOT TO FIND A BETTER NAME FOR THIS BUT ANYWAY IS THERE ARE ISSUING AN ADVISORY OPINION BINDING DECISIONS -- THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED WOULD RULES OF EVIDENCE APPLY -- WE'RE GIVING AUTHORITY HERE -- TO THE STATE AUDITOR. ARE TO BE THE ONE TO GONNA PLACE THE AGENCY THERE THE STATE AUDITOR'S SUBJECT TO THE C. P. R. A. SO THERE'S POTENTIAL THAT THE ON BLITZ PERSON WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW A DECISION BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO DENY DISCLOSURE OF A PUBLIC RECORD. LEADING TO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE THE THE CONCERNS GO ON AND ON WE WE'VE DISCUSSED THEM I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BETTER METHOD -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITH ALL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT THIS BILL. IS NOT RIGHT FOR PRIME TIME IT HAS I THINK TOO MANY -- SIGNIFICANT ARE QUESTIONS ASSOCIATED BOTH WITH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVACY RIGHTS AS WELL AS THAT BALANCING OF PUBLIC ACCESS SO -- AGAIN I I I WOULD I WOULD SAY WOULD LEAVE IT AT THAT I WENT ON A LITTLE LONGER THAN I EXPECTED BUT THERE ARE. MANY MANY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MEASURE -- I WOULD ASK AND IT YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE HERE YOU WANT TO VOTE THAT'S FINE -- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS -- GOING FORWARD SO THAT WE COULD PERHAPS ADDRESS. SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT BASICALLY TAKING THOSE FROM THE JUDICIARY AND PUTTING IT IN THE HANDS OF ONE PERSON. CREATE SOME VERY VERY SERIOUS ISSUES IN AND OF ITSELF SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS -- AND YES SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WOMAN -- I BELIEVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. THAT THE THAT ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS KEY. AND I THINK FOR YA AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- THE FEDERAL AND STATE RESPECTIVE EQUIVALENTS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN IMPERATIVE. THAT WE DON'T OUR RELY ON A FACELESS NAMELESS. I EMPLOYEES BUREAUCRATS IF YOU WILL MAKING DECISIONS. OUR THAT FORCE INDIVIDUALS INTO A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WE ALL KNOW AND HAVE HEARD ABOUT. AT LEAST FOR THE THE COURSE OF THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON HELD BACK LOGGED IT IS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE TO BE. IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO SEEK REDRESS IN THE COURTS THAT THIS IS PRECISELY I THINK WHAT WE NEED. WE NEEDED TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE THAT CAN OVERSEE THESE MATTERS IN A TIMELY FASHION I THINK THIRTY DAYS. MAY BE A BIT SHORT AND IT COMES TO BUT I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE -- I I THINK I WANT TO CLARIFY A POINT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND THIS. THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH AN OMBUDSMAN DECISION TO DISCLOSE ARE NOT DISCLOSED. THAT DOES THAT FOR CLOSE OF PARTY'S ABILITY TO GO TO COURT AND SEEK REDRESS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT WE STILL PRESERVE THE RIGHT FOR ANY PARTY TO GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. TO TO TO SEEK RELIEF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE AN APPEALS PROCESS IN BETWEEN -- THE REJECTION AND A LAWSUIT. ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT THE ONLY RECOURSE YOU HAVE TO GET INFORMATION THAT YOU AS A PUBLIC PERSON DESERVES AND IS IN THE CONSTITUTION AS YOU'RE RIGHT IS THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET THE INFORMATION IS TO SUE THE STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT WE ARE TRYING TO RE BALANCE THE CPR A RIGHT NOW ALL OF YOU THE SCALES ARE TIPPED COMPLETELY AGAINST THE PUBLIC. IT IS COMPLETELY ON THE SIDE OF THE STATE AGENCIES AND SO AT WHAT POINT CAN'T DO WE ALLOW IS SOMEONE OF THE PUBLIC TO GET THE INFORMATION OF WHY THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THE COMMITTEE ITSELF PRESENTED AND MEN MINTS TO ALL THE CONCERNS LISTED THE ANALYSES AND WE ACCEPTED ALL OF THEM. SO THE SO TO SAY THAT SOMEHOW THESE ISSUES CANNOT BE ADDRESS WE PROVIDE CLARITY TO SHOW THAT APPEAL CAN GO THE SUPERIOR COURT AND WHEN THAT AND THAT THEY WILL COVER THE COSTS THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEDENTS. THAT THE BUT THE PERSON HAS TO BE CHOSEN WITH EXPERTISE IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THAT WE CLARIFY THAT THIS REVIEW DOES NOT HAVE LEGAL PRECEDENTS -- AND AND COULD MOVE FORWARD SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AT? IF YOU CAN INDIVIDUAL ONCE THE FOR SAID SEEK INFORMATION FROM A STATE GOVERNMENT IS DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH. YOU ARE YOU GOING TELL ME THE EIGHT INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOW CAN TAKE ON AND ASK FOR INFORMATION THE STATE AGENCY AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WIN. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST BALANCE THE SCALES WE DON'T WANT TO BE TIPPED EITHER WAY BUT IF WE CAN FIND ANY? INDEPENDENT PERSON I'M I'M WILLING TO LOOK AND WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WORK WITH ANY MEMBER IF IT'S THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IF IT'S THE THE AUDITOR RIGHT NOW IS THAT AND TO SEE RIGHT NOW. AND RIGHT NOW IF WE AS WE DEBATE BILLS. A LOT OF THE BILLS WERE DEBATING LEGISLATURE SAYS THAT IF YOU NEED TO SEEK INFORMATION FROM THE AGENCY WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO. THEY NEED TO SEE A FILE A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. WELL THEN HOW DOES SOMEONE DO THAT IF THEY CAN'T GET ANY RELIEF AND SO THAT'S WHAT OUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO ME -- LET ME GIVE YOU. GIVE AN EXAMPLE HERE ME CAN FLUSH IT OUT. AN ENTITY FILES A FOIA REQUEST OR PUBLIC RECORDS. OUR REQUEST AND MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THE STATE GOVERNMENT -- OR ANY OF ITS INSTRUMENTALITY DISCLOSES THE DOCUMENT THAT FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT HAVE PERSONAL INFORMATION ON ME MYSELF SECURITY NUMBER MY PASSPORT SO ON AND SO FORTH. DO I HAVE THE ABILITY TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE OMBUDSMAN IN SAY. HOWEVER YOU DECIDE THIS MY OBJECTION IS THAT IT WILL REVEAL. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT MY IDENTITY SO IF IT IS. IF IT IS DISCLOSED WILL YOU PLEASE DIRECT THAT THAT INFORMATION BE REDACTED IS THAT CONTEMPLATED IN THIS. WEEK WE'RE WILLING TO WORK THAT OUT WE ACTUALLY IT TOOK AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THAT THE BUT THE PERSON DOESN'T MAKE THESE DECISIONS IN A VACUUM THEY ARE SEEKING INFORMATION FROM THE INDIVIDUAL FROM THE NEWS OUTLET FROM THE ORGANIZATION. FROM THE STATE AGENCY SO BEFORE BEFORE ANY INFORMATION IS MADE PUBLIC ON ON ON A WEBSITE THAT ALL THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE WORKED OUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THIS FREE WHEELING PROCESS WHERE ALL THE SEND THEM BUT IT'S PERSON SAYS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA MAKE A DECISION AND I'M GONNA THROW EVERYTHING ON ON ON THE WEB. THIS IS A VERY CAREFUL PROCESS AND SO WE WANT THE APPEALS PROCESS TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ONE YEAH SO THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT ON BUDGET AND SAYS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOUR PASSPORT INFORMATION IS CONFIDENTIAL AND I WILL RELEASE A REPORT AND IT WILL. BE AVAIL BEAT HIM BE MADE AVAILABLE IN A PERIOD OF TIME ON THE WEBSITE. I THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE THAT THROUGH THE COURTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT DOES NOT OCCUR ABSOLUTELY ART. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF BILLS IN THE COURSE OF THIS AND COURSE OF THE SESSION. THIS IS I THINK AT ITS HEART BEATING HEART A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. I MEAN IT REALLY IS I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE YOUR CO AUTHOR. I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S ADMIRABLE -- I'VE CONSULTED WITH FOLKS IN -- IN THE MEDIA AND NEWSPAPERS. THIS IS KEY THIS IS IMPORTANT AND SUCH AS FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF INFORMATION BROKERING. IT'S IT'S IT'S EVERY DAY RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS OF THE US SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR TO FOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT DAVID AND GOLIATH -- THAT ONE OF THEM IS IS IS IS BROUGHT DOWN THE SIDE AND AND I MIGHT MADE BY MAY AND MAY I ADD OUT OF JUST QUIT VERY QUICKLY. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT ON WHETHER THE DMB AT THE REAL ID THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM ALL THE INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED THROUGH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN SOME FORM OR FASHION. BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME INNOVATIVE AND I'LL DEFER TO MY MY YOU KNOW MY MY MY COLLEAGUE HERE BUT YET. ARE YOU YOU CAN'T SAY THAT A NEWS OUTLET MUST SUE THE STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S THE ONLY AND REMEDY TO GET INFORMATION THAT WE ALL DESERVE TO KNOW. SO I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT HERE THAT THE STATEMENT THAT YOU'D MADE EARLIER I DON'T BELIEVE IS ACCURATE IT SAYS HERE -- YOU INDICATED THERE WAS THE ABILITY TO TO PROCEED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT AT TO SEE IF THE ARM PUTS PERSON AND A PERSON DETERMINES THE STATE AGENCY. IMPROPERLY DENIED DISCLOSURE THE PUBLIC RECORD A RECORDS. THE OMBUDSMAN SHALL REQUIRE THE STATE AGENCY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC RECORDS OR RECORDS TO THE MEMBER THE PUBLIC WHO SUBMITTED THE REQUEST FOR REVIEW. THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR EXCUSE ME THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AN APPEAL NOW. YOU ARE ALSO PUTTING IN THE HANDS OF ONE PERSON. THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THIS DECISION. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THERE HAS TO BE GREATER TRANSPARENCY SO THAT IS CLEARLY -- I THINK A BIPARTISAN ISSUE IT IS THE WAY WE GO ABOUT IT DO WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE THE POWER TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TWO ONE HUMAN BEING. PERIOD AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES SO -- I COULD GO THROUGH THE LITANY OF OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IT THE C. P. R. A. TODAY ALLOWS FOR ATTORNEYS FEES IF THAT PERSON WINS THE CASE. YOU USE IT AS ED THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN SOMEONE CAN SAY I DON'T WANT MY INFORMATION BEING. USED HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW WHAT'S EVEN BEING SOUGHT I MEAN THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY ISSUES HERE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE YEARS. OF PRECEDENT AND PUT IT INTO SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY NOT BAIT AND I THINK IT IT CREATES A VERY. DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO PUT THIS KIND OF POWER INSURANCE ONE PERSON SITTING IN AN OFFICE. WHERE THERE MAY VERY WELL BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO -- I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BILL I DON'T SEE WHERE -- WE NEED TO BE -- GOING FOR WITH ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS STILL UNANSWERED YOU INDICATED YOU'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES THIS IS A HUGE. AND IT REQUIRES REAL DELIBERATION SO THAT ALL PARTIES TO THIS IS BALANCED AND ALL PARTIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HEARD AND MADE THEIR CASE IN A NONPARTISAN. UNBIASED FASHION THAT'S WHERE WE'VE USED THE COURTS UP UNTIL NOW BUT TO CREATE THIS. ON BOARDS PERSON WITH ALL THIS POWER I THINK REALLY REQUIRES THAT WE BE MORE CONTEMPLATE OF THIS IS NOT THIS THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER CERTAINLY NOT AS IT EXISTS TODAY IN MY OPINION YES SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I APPLAUD YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK WE ALL SHARE. THE OBJECTIVE WHICH IS TO TRY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND CREATE. MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS INFORMATION. BUT I SHARE. MANY OF THE CONCERNS VOICED BY THE CHAIR THE LIST OF QUESTIONS. I THINK. I'VE HEARD YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THEM BUT MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM TODAY -- IS THE PERSON WHAT'S THE PERSON'S TRAINING WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT NATURE. OF A RULING OR DECISION THEY MIGHT MAKE. SOME [inaudible] IN THE I'M NOT PREPARED TO BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AND WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR CO AUTHOR -- TO TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS IN CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS. PROTECTS THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. OF OF ALL. IN THAT DUE PROCESS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAST IT AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO SEEKS ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS. VERSUS. A MONOLITHIC BUREAUCRACY WELL SOME OF THE RECORDS WITHIN THAT MONOLITHIC BUREAUCRACY MIGHT. PRESENT PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL STATE EMPLOYEE OF FRONTLINE. EMPLOYEE AND SO THE BALANCING ACT THAT THE COURT COURTS CURRENTLY EXERCISE PROTECTING THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. THIS HAS TO BE IRON CLAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ARE INDEED PROTECTED SO. I'M NOT PREPARED TO BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY I AM PREPARED. TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHORS. TO SEE IF THERE'S A PATHWAY TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CENTER MONNING ANY OTHER COMMENTS I'LL JUST SAY THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE ENOUGH. FOR THE DIALOGUE IN THE QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY -- I I WILL LOOK I WANT TO WORK -- FOR FOR THE WORK WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN YOURSELF. TO TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND I BELIEVE THAT -- WE CAN ADD THAT THE QUESTIONS IN THE CONCERNS OUTLINED CAN BE EASILY ADDRESSED NINETEEN STATES IN THE UNION HAVE DONE THIS. FROM ARIZONA TO NEW YORK AND AS I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING AS THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WROTE IN CBS VERSES BLOCK. IMPLICIT IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS A NOTION THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS ACTIONS. IN ORDER TO VERIFY ACCOUNTABILITY INDIVIDUALS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT FILES SUCH ACCESS PERMITS CHECKS AGAINST ARE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL POWER IN SECRECY IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THIS BILL SHOULD NOT STOP RIGHT HERE IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY IN A GIVES PUBLIC GREATER ACCESS I PLEASE I URGE AND AND AND I ABOUT. THANK YOU IN RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT SOME STATES HAVE BINDING -- THORNY OTHERS ONLY ADVISORY. IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE STATES HAVE PUBLIC RECORDS LAWS THAT ARE ANALOGOUS TO OUR C. P. R. A.. ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDTO THE PERMISSIVE -- EXEMPTIONS -- BUT I CERTAINLY -- EXCEPT YOUR DESIRE TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS SO I THINK THERE IS A A WAY TO GET -- TO THAT IMPORTANT BALANCING SO THAT THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE WHILE WE ALSO CAREFULLY CONSIDERED PRIVACY RIGHTS I WANT TO COMMEND YOU -- FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND WHILE I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS NOW IN AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAR TOO PREMATURE WITH TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND THAT IS MY RECOMMENDATION.

PENDENCY COUNCIL RAISE OUR CHILDREN ON OUR BEHALF SIXTY THOUSAND OF THEM -- THEY HAVE A COMPLETELY UNIQUE ROLE IN OUR ENTIRE. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM OF CHILD WELFARE -- WE CAN'T KNOW HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. FOR THESE CHILDREN AND LESS WE KNOW THIS KIND OF PRETTY SPECIFIC INFORMATION AGAINST WHICH TO BENCHMARK THEIR THEIR DAILY WORK. AND FOR THAT REASON ON THEIR BEHALF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE. YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF FOOD PLEASE STEP FORWARD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MADISON VALLEY ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION I KNOW THERE WAS SOME LATE OPPOSITION SUBMITTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS ANYONE HERE ON THAT. PLEASE STEP FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THOUGH THAT THIS CAME LATE FRIDAY NIGHT WELL PAST THE DEADLINE -- AND REALLY WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE EXAMINED IT MORE CAREFULLY -- BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD -- TWO MINUTES AT THE MOST PLEASE ANDY LEVON BOMB ON BEHALF OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ESSENTIALLY APPROPRIATE CASELOADS STANDARDS. FOR JUDGES SITTING INDEPENDENCE THE PROCEEDINGS IS NOT INFORMATION THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS OF WAR CAN GATHER -- WHAT WE CAN AND DO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR? IS AN UPDATED JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT QUANTIFIES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS NEEDED IN EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COURTS. BASED ON WORKLOAD MEASURE AND THAT'S A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE OF FILINGS AND CASE WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON A TIME STUDY. THAT TIME STUDY TELLS US THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MINUTES A JUDICIAL OFFICER PERFORMS TASKS SO ON A GIVEN CASE TYPE. SO WE CAN AND DO TELL THE LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR HOW MANY JUDGES THE COURTS NEED BASED ON HOW MUCH TIME JUDGES SPEND ON THEIR CASES. AND HOW MANY FILINGS THERE ARE. WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE A WE CANNOT SAY IS WHAT AN APPROPRIATE OR PREFERRED STANDARD MIGHT BE? THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT DEPENDENCY CASES AND THE FAMILY IS IMPACTED BY THE INCREDIBLY SERIOUS DECISIONS MADE IN DEPENDENCY COURT. DESERVE SUFFICIENT JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. AND THE VERY SAME CAN BE SAID OF PROBATE CASES AND THE CONSERVATIVES IN CONSERVATORS WHO ARE IN CRITICAL NEED OF THEIR DAY IN COURT. AND LIKEWISE FAMILIES UNDER EVICTION NOTICE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE COURT HAS SUFFICIENT JUDGES SITTING IN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS TO ENSURE JUSTICE. PARENTS EMBROILED IN CHILD CUSTODY DISPUTES EMPLOYEES TRYING TO ENFORCE THEIR LABOR RIGHTS. AND MANY OTHERS ARE ALSO AS DESERVING. WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE AGREES THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS CRITICAL WHICH IS THE REASON THAT YOU FUNDED TWENTY FIVE NEW TRIAL COURT JUDGESHIPS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THOSE TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS AS YOU KNOW ARE PART OF A REQUEST FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY JUDGESHIPS. AND THANKS TO YOUR EFFORTS NOW SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY REQUESTED JUDGESHIPS ARE FUNDED. BUT THESE JUDICIAL POSITIONS DO NOT INCLUDE THE NUMEROUS CALENDAR PREFERENCES CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THIS BODY OR ACHING LINED INTO LAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS AS I UNDERSTAND AND I'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FACT I SIT ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- BUT HOW CAN THIS STUDY ON ON ON CASELOAD TO IT I MEAN YOU'RE INDICATING THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF THIS INFORMATION. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. WHAT IF I WASN'T CLEAR I APOLOGIZE WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IN THE WE PUT FORWARD IS BASED ON INFORMATION OF EXISTING TIME THAT JUDICIAL OFFICERS ARE SPENDING ON IT DEPENDENCY CASES? BUT A PREFERRED OR APPROPRIATE NUMBER WE WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT A BETTER NUMBER WOULD BE FROM WHAT WE HAVE. BUT WE DO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR ON WITH THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ARE SO LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND YEAH I I RESPOND TO A FEW THINGS. OUT ONE AT CHAIR WE ALSO TO WERE DISAPPOINTED THIS MAN I CONSENT IN EVERY COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKE IT THIS WAY OPPOSITION FOR ISSUES THAT. TO THE EXTENT THEY EVEN EXISTED HAVE EXISTED ALL ALONG THROUGH THE PROCESS THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT THIS IS A STUDY BILL IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT. ASKING THEM TO DECIDE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CASES OR WHO SHOULD BE HEARING THEM I THINK WHAT WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER TO IS. YOU KNOW WE AS A BODY THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS A BODY THAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JUDICIAL CASO THAT MAY COME OUT OF THIS. THAT IS HELPFUL TO US IN DECIDING FOR THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION THAT HAS ISSUES AT THIS HAS NOTHING I THINK WAS RAISED UNLAWFUL DETAINER IS OR SOME OTHER AT AND IN HERE ALL OF THEM. THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT A VERY VULNERABLE CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ALL OF US IN. THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT STAKE IN MAKING SURE ARE HANDLED APPROPRIATELY AND THIS IS A STUDY BILL THAT WILL GO TO HELP IN ANY OF US PROVIDE COME UP WITH CERTAINLY THIS COMMITTEE TO HELP PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTION. MOTION -- IT WILL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU. OF THE MOTION IS A DO PASSED THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES AND PERHAPS. THAT YOUR CONCERNS CAN BE FLUSHED OUT THEN OF FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- INDICT DO APPRECIATE THIS BILL OF THE OUR KIDS ARE ARE ARE MOST AT RISK AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER FOR THEM SO.

THREE TWO NINE THIS OFTEN TRIGGERS A FINAL TIME TO GET SOCIAL WORKERS INVESTIGATE THEIR CLAIM. THIS PROCESS THAT I AM AMENDING IS ALREADY A LAST RESORT SCENARIO. BUT WE AS A STATE SHOULD BE DOING WHATEVER WE CAN PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH SAFETY SHELTER AND A SPEEDY PROCESS. AB EIGHT SIX ONE PRIORITIZE IS USED FOR HOMELESS USE. OF HIS REDUCE OR NEGLECT AND HAVE FORMALLY BEEN INDEPENDENT OF THE COURT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE SOCIAL WORK IT HAS TO FOLLOW. AND COMMENCED APPENDICES PROCEEDINGS WERE NOT FROM THREE WEEKS TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS. IN CASE WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKERS TRIED TO DO NOTHING AFTER THOSE TEN BUSINESS DAYS THE MINOR IN THEIR COUNSEL ME SUBMIT A PETITION TO THE COURT. FOR REVIEW. IF THAT STEP IS TAKEN THAN THIS BILL GIVES THE CORD TO FOURTEEN DAYS TO EITHER AFFIRM OR VERSE THE SOCIAL WORKER'S DECISION. THIS PROCESS IS ONLY USED AS A LAST RESORT FOR YOUTH. WHICH CALLS TO THE HOT ONE HAVE NOT BEEN ACTED ON THESE ARE KIDS TO HAVE CONTINUOUS MAKE CLAIMS ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AND ARE NOW CONSIDERED HOMELESS. PLEASE HOME TODAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS FASTER FOR CHILDREN. FOR MORE HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS CAMILLUS THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEARS. AND PALMER VOCALS FROM BAY AREA LEGAL AID. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES PLEASE. MY NAME IS PAUL REVIEW CALLED SOME A STAFF ATTORNEY A BAY AREA LEGAL AID AND I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT SIXTY ONE WHICH PROPOSES A MODERATE REDUCTION IN THE TIMELINE IN WHICH THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY MUST INVADED. INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT REGARDING THE SMALL NUMBER OF HOMELESS OR PREVIOUSLY SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH WHO PETITION FOR AN INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE FORMAL PROCESS. WE HAVE ASSISTED NUMEROUS HOMELESS YOUTH AND SUBMITTING REQUESTS FOR CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATIONS ALL BASED ON ALLEGATIONS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES WHERE THE AGENCY EITHER NEVER RESPONDED OR ELECTED NOT TO INTERVENE. I PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CASE EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ISSUE AN IMPORTANT TO BE SHORTENED INVESTIGATORY TIMELINE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. CASE A ALLEGATIONS OF PHYSICAL pFAILING TO PROVIDE FOOD AND KICKING YOU THOUGHT OF THE FAMILY HOME WERE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCY ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS. THE MINOR SUBMITTED AN INVESTIGATION REQUEST THE AGENCY WHICH RESPONDED TEN DAYS LATER THAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE UNFOUNED AND NO PETITION WOULD BE FILED. THE MINOR THAN REQUESTED A HEARING SIX WEEKS LATER FOLLOWING TWO DAYS OF TESTIMONY ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS THE AGENCY AGREED TO FILE A DEPENDENCY PETITION. THIRTY THREE DAYS LATER THE MINOR WAS DECLARED A BIT A DEPENDENT. CASE BE ALLEGATIONS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE NEGLECT ON THE BASIS OF FAILURE TO PROVIDE BASIC SUPPORT WERE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCY ON THREE OCCASIONS OVER TWO MONTHS. THE MINOR THAN SUBMITTED INVESTIGATION REQUEST TO THE AGENCY AND DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. AFTER THREE WEEKS MINOR COUNCIL REQUESTED A HEARING AT WHICH THE AND THE AGENCY WAS ORDERED TO FILE DEPENDENCY PETITION WHICH THE TWELVE DAYS LATER. THAT'S THE AGENCY WAS AWARE OF ABUSE NEGLECT WITH THE ALLEGATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE CHILD'S INVESTIGATION REQUEST AFTER SUBMISSION OF WHICH TEN WEEKS PASSED BEFORE THE MINOR BECAME INDEPENDENT. IN THESE CASES HIGHLIGHT TO IMPORTANT ISSUES FIRST IT CAN TAKE UP TO TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FILE UNDER WORK THREE THIRTY ONE EVEN WHERE NO DECISION IS MADE OR INVESTIGATION COMPLETED. AND SECOND WHEN YOUTH MUST ULTIMATELY CHALLENGE THE DECISION IT CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL WEEKS OR MONTHS. AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU CAN ONLY REMAIN IN SHELTERS FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. EVEN IF EXTENDED WITH THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED LEGISLATION YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE YOUNG LONGER A YOUNG PERSON REMAINS IN SHELTER WAITING INVESTIGATION THE MORE DESTABILIZE THEY BECOME DUE TO INCREASING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS TRANSPORTATION LIMITATIONS THAT INTERFERE SCHOOL ACT THANK YOU EDUCATIONAL A QUEUE FOR TESTIMONY. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES PLEASE I CAN LOW'S REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOU THREE REPRESENT A LOT OF THE RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTERS IN THE STATE. AND WHEN MINERS COME INTO FOR OUR UNDERAGE SHELTERS ARE FOR SCHOOLS TO TRYING TO FAMILY REUNIFICATION TO WORK WITH THE FAMILY TO RETURN THAT TWN. HOME TO THEIR PARENTS AND WHEN IT IS UNSAFE TO DO SO FOR THOSE YOUTH AND WE WORK WITH. EITHER FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEXT THERE'S AND SOMETIMES DURING THAT OUR STAFF ARE MANDATED REPORTERS AND WE MAKE CALLS TO THE MINUTE A HOTLINE. AND MAKE CLAIMS OF ABUSE AND WE FILE THE REPORTS FREEBIES NEGLECT AND SOMETIMES THEY GET ON AN UNANSWERED WE'VE HAD AS STORY AROUND THE YOUTH WE HAD FIFTEEN TIMES WE CALLED. THE HOTLINE FOR THEM THEY WERE BEING MOLESTED BY THEIR MOMS PARTNER -- BUT NEVER CAME OUT THE YOUTH ENDED UP HAVING A FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND THEN A BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITAL. IN THAT CASE IN THE SOCIAL WORKER -- AT THE HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO BRING ON INVESTIGATION THE SOCIAL WORKER DETERMINE THAT THAT -- THAT IT WAS SAFE FOR HER TO RETURN TO THE HOME AND THE FAMILY ALLEGE THAT SHE HAD LET ON THE MOMS PARTNER IN THAT CASE THE YOUTH HOUSE THEN. RETURNED BACK TO THE SHELTER AND IS TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF A THREE TWENTY NINE THESE ARE VERY VERY ONEROUS CASES A VERY LAST RESORT. WE REALLY WANT TO WORK THROUGH THE HOT LINE PROCESS IS OUR STAFF ARE MANDATED REPORTERS AND THE OTHER QUESTION BECOMES IS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING THAT'S HAPPENING TO THE MINUTE REPORT. SO -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP UP NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE AT HOWARD SENIOR COUNSEL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LOS CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY OF STUDENTS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD LADIES WOULD BE SANTA'S ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA -- WE REPRESENT SOCIAL WORKERS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WE FIELD ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS TO THE HOT LINE EVERY SINGLE MONTH. THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT THIS MEASURE ARE. SEVERAL FOLD THE FIRST OF WHICH IS WE BELIEVE THAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM HASN'T BEEN ARTICULATED TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT WE'VE HEARD THREE EXAMPLES OF ANECDOTES. ARM WE DO NOT HAVE A SHARED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS THAT THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL WORKERS NOT BEING RESPONSIVE ACTUALLY EXISTS TO THE CONTRARY MY SOCIAL WORKERS TELL ME NOT ONLY ARE THEY CONTINUALLY RESPONSIVE. DEDICATED TO THEIR WORK BUT THEY ALSO NEED THE ENTIRE TWENTY ONE DAYS IN ORDER TO DO THE INVESTIGATION AS REQUIRED UNDER LAW. THEY CANNOT GO TO COURT WITH A PETITION RESPONSE UNLESS THEY HAVE. EVIDENCE EMANATING FROM THEIR INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR RESPONSE. ON SECONDLY THE CONCERN IS THAT THE PROBLEM AS ARTICULATED WHICH IS THE JUXTAPOSITION BETWEEN THE TWENTY ONE DAY TIMELINE -- AFTER WHICH YOU HAVE TO LEAVE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND THE TWENTY ONE DAY TIMELINE FOR MY SOCIAL WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND ON BUT THE TO ONE ANOTHER THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM BECAUSE SOCIAL WORKERS -- WHEN THEY RESPOND WITHIN THE TWENTY ONE DAY TIME FRAME EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SET THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE COURT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE? AND BECAUSE OF THAT. UP ENDING THE TIME FRAME BY WHICH SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE TO RESPOND DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET AT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM FINALLY AND THE DEEPEST CONCERN OF ALL IS THIS SEEKS TO PRIORITIZE ONE CLASS OF YOUTH INDIVIDUAL. ABOVE ALL OTHERS REPLACING THE JUDGMENT EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING OF SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THIS ARBITRARY TIME PRIME TIME FRAME. BASED ON ALL WE KNOW THUS FAR ANECDOTAL DATA SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE CONCERNED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION NOT OPPOSED TO AB SIXTY ONE BUT I AM SHARING CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- WE HAVE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ALONG THE SAME LINES AS MISSY INCHES NOTED EARLIER AND CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SHORTENING OF THE TIME FRAMES OF THE BILL ALONG WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE TARGET GROUP. TO WHOM THE SHORTENED TIME FRAMES APPLY A WE ALSO SHARE THE WORKLOAD CONCERNS AS YET HE WAS RAISED. US SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY CAN BUY LIKE HE'S IN COURT. AND SUPPORT THAT FAILING TO A JUDGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SHORTENING TIME LINES FOR GROUP THAT WE FEEL IS OVERLY BROAD IN THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT. WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS AND ON LANGUAGE TO NARROW THAT GROUP BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE -- YET ON LANGUAGE AS TO HOW TO DO THAT -- WE'VE ENSURING LANGUAGE BACK AND FORTH -- DILIGENTLY A AND HAVE NOT YET COME TO AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THE SPONSOR ORGANIZATIONS AND SCA IT HOPEFULLY COME TO AGREEMENT SOON. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COUNTIES ROUTINELY IGNORE THESE FILINGS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT VULNERABLE USED TO WAIT LONGER THAN NECESSARY IF I WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR PETITION SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO FIGURING SOMETHING OUT THAT WILL WORK OUT FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE TAKE A BREAK OR THE NATIONAL SAYS HIS.

AB [inaudible] ELEVEN THIRTY GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT AND NOT GOOD EVENING HI FEAR THAT YOU MAY BE HERE -- THAT LATE IT IS A FEAR I THINK WE ALL SHARE -- YOU'RE FAMILIAR -- WITH DATA BREACH -- ISSUES AND TO AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS SPONSORED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD REQUIRE -- NOTIFICATION OF DATA BREACHES -- FOR IT. PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE PASSPORT NUMBERS AS WELL AS BIOMETRIC DATA THESE ARE ALL -- THE TYPE OF NOTIFICATION ALREADY EXISTS FOR SO MUCH -- SO MANY OTHER NUMBERS AND SO MUCH OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT -- WE EXPECT WHEN WE GIVE OUR INFORMATION TO A COMPANY THAT THEY DO REASONABLE THINGS TO PROTECT IT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT FOR OUR PASSPORT NUMBERS AND FOR A BIOMETRIC DATA AS WELL -- SEXUALLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE I DO HAVE TO EXPERT WITNESSES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY WITH ME. TODAY -- WE'VE GOT ANTI LOU AND STACY STRUCTURE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. NINE AND TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD -- WE ARE BOTH PLANNING TO TESTIFY. I KNOW YOU CAN'T AND I'M JUST WONDERING YOU BOTH FROM THE AG'S OFFICE IS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STACY SASSER SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE PRIVACY UNIT AT THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS AB ELEVEN THIRTY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. IN RESPONSE TO LAST YEAR'S STAR WOULD MARRY A BREACH IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDED TO UPDATE ITS DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION BILL AND REASONABLE DATA SECURITY STATUTE. IF THE BREACH DID NOT HAPPEN ON A NATIONAL SCALE THE COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBLIGATED TO ALERT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THAT THEIR PASSPORT AND TRAVEL INFORMATION HAD BEEN ACCESSED. BECAUSE OUR STATUTES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH OTHER STATES LAWS MANDATING THIS REQUIREMENT. FURTHER IDENTITY VERIFICATION IS SHIFTING FROM THINGS YOU CARRY ON YOU LIKE A CREDIT CARD OR A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE A PASSPORT A PASSWORD. TO WHAT YOU ARE AND PROTECTING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION DATA THAT IS CORE TO WHO WE PHYSICALLY ARE MUST FALL WITHIN THE PROTECTION OF THE STATUTES. BOTH OF THESE DATA POINTS GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID NUMBERS AND YOUR BIOMETRIC INFORMATION ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE AN HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN COVERED. BY REASONABLE SECURITY AND DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. AB ELEVEN THIRTY ALSO ENSURES THAT THE THAT THE STATUTES REMAIN CONSISTENT WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR CONSUMERS AND PLACES AN OBLIGATION ON BUSINESSES TO PROACTIVELY PROTECT THE STATE THESE DATA POINTS WITH REASONABLE SECURITY. AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT THAT IF THE DATA IS BREACHED THE BUSINESSES MUST NOTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL SO THAT HE OR SHE CAN TAKE STEPS. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM FRAUD IDENTITY THEFT. IT ALSO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES CAN COMPLY IF THE CREEK THE DATA ENCRYPTION PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR WHICH FURTHER AT THAT INCENTIVIZE IS THIS LEVEL OF PROTECTION. FOR THIS REASON WE WE SUPPORT AB ELEVEN THIRTY AND HARMONIZING THESE CALIFORNIA STATUTES WITH OTHER STATE STATUTES WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA REMAINS AT THE FOREFRONT OF PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY THANK YOU. FOR MUCH TO WISH TO TESTIFY YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT'S FINE WITH ME OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. MORE MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. EMILY RUSCH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL PARK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NANCY DRABBLE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I SERRA BOOT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER TO BRIEFLY STATE -- AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. OFFERS I JUST WANT TO SAY WE-REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE A REAL TO HAVE WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH A SPONSOR. THEY WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS -- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO ARTICULATE WITH PARTICULARITY THE GOVERNMENT IDEAS ISSUE AND TO APPROPRIATELY DEFINE THE SCOPE OF BIOMETRIC DATA USED TO AUTHENTICATE SOMEBODY -- TO BE CLEAR WE DO NOT OPPOSE -- THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL FOR% NOTIFICATION OR FOR REASONABLE SECURITY AND FRANKLY WE WOULD NOT EVEN OPPOSE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE JUST WANT TO ARTICULATE FOR THE RECORD -- A REMAINING CONCERNED THIS BILL IS THE EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY ONEROUS FOR BUSINESSES -- BECAUSE IT HAS. NO REQUIREMENT FOR PROOF OF INJURY AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. STEP FORWARD PLEASE. BUT HAVING COME AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM IMPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM DIMITRI ATTACK THAT WE ALSO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF CAL CHAMBER AND ARE ALSO POISONOUS AMENDED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS DID YOU ONE I'M SORRY. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S BEEN HEARD. ALL RIGHT NO OTHER OPPOSITION NO NEUTRALITY ART WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS OF THEIR ANY QUESTIONS. RIGHT I WANNA THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE -- AS YOU MENTION -- WE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TIER. OF BIOMETRICS AND ALL A WHOLE NEW WORLD AND CERTAINLY DID YOU ONE STATION. YEAH ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU OF THE TERROR -- FOR WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS -- THIS ISSUE AS WELL BECAUSE THAT IS AN IDENTIFIER I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING. MORE OF A SPECIFIC AND AND DRAMATIC THAN THAN ONE'S PHYSICAL BIOMETRIC IDENTITY -- SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPONDED TO THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN -- PLEASE SO WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. YEAH WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR WE WILL BE AFTER THIRTEEN STATES THAT ARE PROTECTED PASS FOR INFORMATION AND GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID -- WILL BE AFTER TWELVE STATES THAT HAVE DONE BIOMETRIC DATA -- WE HAVE WORKED WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS -- WE WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO FIND COMMON GROUND -- BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE DONE -- SIGNIFICANT WORK -- TO TO TO MEET -- THE WHAT WE MUST DO TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU OF THE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST GETTING MY HEAD AROUND THIS SO CAN YOU HELP. JUST WALK ME THROUGH WHAT'S INCLUDING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION. WHAT'S THE SORT OF SCOPE OF THAT DATA SAID THEY'LL BIOMETRIC DATA IS THE THAT THAT'S GENERATED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OR ANALYSIS OF HUMAN BODY CHARACTERISTICS AND IT'S USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION -- SO FINGERPRINT FACIAL RECOGNITION -- A SCAN OF YOUR IRIS -- THERE'S OTHER WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE YOUR PHYSICAL BODY CHARACTERISTICS THAT THAT OUR OUR AND OUR SPECIFICALLY TECHNICALLY ANALYZE -- IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT YOU ARE IN FACT HENRY STERN AND NOT A DIFFERENT HAD RESTART. IT AND SO AND YOUR SENATE CCPA DOESN'T COVER THAT KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. THE CPA COVERS BIOMETRIC DATA THERE'S A SPECIFIC DEFINITION THAT IS OFFERED TO FIND WITHIN THE TAXES THE CPA -- BUT BIOMETRIC DATA IS NOT COVERED IN THE CONTEXT OF MANDATING REASONABLE DATA SECURITY OR IN THE CONTEXT OF BRIDGE NOTIFICATION. THE BIOMETRIC DATA IS A FORM OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE STATUTE. WITH AN EASY PAY FOR THE TO THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. INCLUDES BIOMETRIC DATA BUT THE APPLICATION OF THE DATA BREACH PROVISIONS WITHIN THE CCPA. DON'T APPLY IN THIS SPECIFIC IN IS BY A METRIC CONTEXT CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE DATA BREACH STATUTE AND THE REASONABLE DATA SECURITY STATUTE NEITHER INCLUDE BIOMETRIC INFORMATION. AND SO SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T YOU COULD OPT OUT OF DISCLOSING YOUR YOUR YOUR BIOMETRIC DATA AS SAY AS A SORT OF USER THAT ON THE FRONT END BUT THEN ON THE BACK AND AND A BREACH INSTANCE NOW COMPANIES WOULD BE LIABLE -- FOR HAVING THAT KIND OF DATA SAID. IF A COMPANY MAINTAINS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION OR COLLECTS INFORMATION AND THAT HAS BEEN BREACHED UNDER SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHTY TWO INTO THE BREACH OF ADVOCATION THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT THE BREACH HAS OCCURRED. UNDER CCPA THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT SET OF RIGHTS THAT OUR ARE IN ARE ARE MANDATED BY STATUTE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE RIGHT TO DELETE. OR THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SALE. THAT'S WHAT -- TCP CONTROLS WHICH IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM REQUIRING THE BUSINESSES PROTECT AND SAFEGUARD THAT DATA WITH REASONABLE DATA SECURITY OR IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH NOTIFY. THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED SO FROM. AROUND THE OPPOSITION STILL HERE BUT SO WHAT WHAT'S THE CONCERN THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME EXPANSION OF P. R. A. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE DO YOU MIND. YEAH SORRY IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible] JUST JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE HERE SO YOU YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MORE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THESE BREACH INSTANCES WE THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS THAT THE C. CPI. HE'S PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS SO ONEROUS WERE HAS NO PROOF OF INJURY AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BIOMETRIC DATA USED TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE IN MOST CASES YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE ACTUAL FINGERPRINT FOR EXAMPLE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMPANY TAKEN A SCAN OF A FINGERPRINT AND MAYBE THEY USE LIKE FIFTEEN DATA POINTS ARE TWENTY DATA POINTS THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THE SAME AS WHAT ANOTHER COMPANY USES. OR THE ANYONE IS GONNA KNOW WHAT THOSE EVEN MEAN POTENTIALLY SO IF THERE IS A BREACH IT'S FAR LESS LIKELY THAT THAT KIND OF DATA WOULD LEAD. TO SOMEONE GETTING IDENTITY STOLEN AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW THAT IT'S SO IT'S A SAFER ALTERNATIVE TO VERIFY SOMEONE'S IDENTITY THAN SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO PURSUE. BUT UNDER THE C. C. P.'S PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH THERE'S NO PROOF OF INJURY REQUIRED. SO EVEN IF YOU GO DOWN THE SAFER ROUTE YOU GET THE BREACH NO ONE'S BEEN INJURED YOU'RE STILL GONNA GET SUED THE SAME IF YOU HAD BEEN -- BREACH WITH A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN WITH IT -- I LIKE I SAID THEY ADDRESS MOST OF OUR ISSUES IN THIS BILL BUT THAT'S THAT'S OUR MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE PRIDE REDUCTION. DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M. WITH THE CPA THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS ONLY TRIGGERED IN THE EVENT THAT NON ENCRYPTED INFORMATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. AND THE SO IN THAT SENSE YOU KNOW THAT WOULD THE END IS INDUSTRY STANDARDS -- INSTRUCT COMPANIES TO ENCRYPT BIOMETRIC DATA AND SO IN IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST BUSINESSES WHO EXPOSED NON ENCRYPTED DATA WOULD BE TARGETED AT BUSINESSES THAT DID NOT IMPLEMENT THOSE REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THAT DATA. AND SO IT'S ONLY IN THE SPECIFIC INSTANCE IN WHICH NON ENCRYPTED DATA HAS BEEN SUBJECT -- TO EXFILTRATION EARTH AFTER ACCESS UNDERSEA CPA. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE QUESTIONS AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET DEEPER INTO THIS POLICY AND HELP PROTECT -- CALIFORNIANS SO THINK YOU'RE MUCH CENTERS FOR SOME SPEC FULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU TO HAVE A MOTION.

I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE PROTECT CALIFORNIA CALL CENTER JOB ACT. CALL CENTERS ARE MAJOR ECONOMIC FORCE IN THE U. S. REPRESENTING ABOUT 3% OF OUR WORKFORCE. YET THE NUMBER OF COMES BECAUSE TO MY SERVICE CONTEXT CONTRACT THàNH TEXANA JOBS HAS DECLINED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS BY. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LARGELY DUE TO OUTSOURCING AND LAYOFFS. IT HAS BECOME ALL TOO COMMON FOR CORPORATIONS TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF STATE FUNDING AND SUBSIDIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING JOBS OVERSEAS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CORPORATIONS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE SUBSIDIES WHILE FUNNELING CALL CENTER JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THE SHUTDOWN OF JUST FIVE CALL CENTERS FROM ONE COMPANY RESULTED IN NEARLY A THOUSAND MIDDLE CLASS JOBS LOST. CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR OUTSOURCING AND TO CONTINUE SUBSIDIZING CORPORATIONS THAT EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS ONLY SERVE TO INCENTIVIZE THIS BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE OF THE JOB SHOULD BE BASE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS SEEKING TO RELOCATE CALL CENTERS JOBS IN CALIFORNIA TO ANOTHER COUNTRY GIVE THE LABOR COME COMMISSIONER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS NOTICE. IN ADDITION EMPLOYEE WHO EXPORTS CALL CENTER JOBS OVERSEAS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING ANY STATE GRANTS GUARANTEED LOANS OR TAX CREDITS FOR FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. HERE IS PRETTY TODAY WITH -- WITH ME IS TOM RUNYON WHO'S VICE PRESIDENT OF CW A DISTRICT NINE A. ENDED MAYES YOU'LL HIT HER NOT THIS ON BEHALF OF CW A DISTRICT NOT. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING TWO MINUTES PLEASE OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM RUNYON I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT. NINE AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AS WE ARE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. CALL CENTERS ARE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC LIFELINE FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY WORKERS WITHIN THE JOB TITLE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT THOUSANDS OF CALL CENTER WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. IN RECENT YEARS AS MAJOR CORPORATIONS. HAVE OFF SHORT CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS OVERSEAS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTEEN T. HAS CLOSE CALL CENTERS IN ANAHEIM BAKERSFIELD ATWATER SACRAMENTO. OAKLAND AND EIGHTEEN T. IS CERTAINLY REDUCE ITS WORKFORCE IN SAN RAMON FRESNO SAN DIEGO COMMERCE PASADENA ESCONDIDO AND TORRANCE. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SPECTRUM FORMALLY TIME WARNER CABLE CLOSEST CALL CENTER IN PALM DESERT. LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED WORKERS. IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN VERIZON WIRELESS CLOSE ITS CALL CENTER IN IRVINE THAT EMPLOYED OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS. IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS CALL CENTER IN RANCHO CORDOVA ALSO LAYING OFF OVER ONE THOUSAND MEMBERS. EVEN WORKERS WHO WERE PART OF STATE CONTRACTS PROVIDE CALL CENTER WORK ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS RIGHT NOW OUTSOURCING. THIS TREND IS HARMED WORKING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS AMERICA. WHILE ENDANGERING CONSUMER SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE CALL CENTERS IN COSTA RICA WERE HOME TO A MASSIVE TELEMARKETING SCAM. THAT DEFRAUDED THOUSANDS OF U. S. CITIZENS MOST OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE OF UPWARDS OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WITH NEW TAX PROVISIONS IN THE TRUMP TAX BILL COMPANIES ARE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICES WORK OVERSEAS THANK YOU.

GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR THE TWO THOUGHT SIX O'CLOCK WAS OKAY WHAT WELL I'M SURE WILL BE HERE AT SIX O'CLOCK AS WELL SO EITHER WAY. GOOD GOOD DAY BUT I THINK IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE'RE AT RESPECTFULLY POSTED THIS BILL I THINK WE HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN BY THIS BILL. WE THINK IF WE WANT TO KEEP JOBS IN CALIFORNIA MORE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WOULD BE. PERHAPS EXPLORING WAYS TO REDUCE ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE REGULATORY BURDEN -- ON BUSINESSES. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE DO THINK THAT THIS BILL MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT WILL EVER ACTUALLY ATTRACT CALL CENTER JOBS TO CALIFORNIA -- I THINK A CALL CENTER WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO RELOCATE TO CALIFORNIA IF THIS LAWS ON THE BOOKS KNOWING THAT IF THEY EVER DECIDE TO RELOCATE -- THEY'LL BE SUBJECT TO THE MEASURES IN THIS BILL WE HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSOR -- ABOUT SOME -- ISSUES AND THEY'VE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS WHICH WE APPRECIATE I JUST WANT TO BRING A ONE ISSUE TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION. THERE'S AN EXISTING SECTION OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE SECTION ONE TO ONE FORTY WHICH WAS ADDED BY BRINGING A BILL IN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH REGULATES CERTAIN PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND CALL CENTERS -- ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BENEFIT PROGRAMS THAT WORK HAS TO BE PERFORMED IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE -- PROVISIONS HAVE CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THE STATUTE ALSO SPECIFICALLY SAYS THE LIMITATIONS DON'T APPLY IF IT WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW OR FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- AND WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THIS BILL RELATES TO THAT EXISTING PROVISION OF LAW WHETHER IT SUITS SUPERSEDES IT. OR NOT WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AND WE ALSO THINK -- SOME LANGUAGECOULD BE ADDED TO THIS BILL SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING PUBLIC CONTRACTS COULD SECTION TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS DOESN'T CONTRAVENE. TRADE AGREEMENTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WERE UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED IT WILL CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR ABOUT POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU RESPOND OR THROUGH YOUR WITNESSES RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BUILT. MAKE A STATEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA SO GOOD COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR VERY QUICKLY -- ON THE ISSUE OF HOW THIS BILL WOULD INTERACT WITH THE CURRENT LAW NOW WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT THERE ARE IS LIMITED THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WITH THIS BILL -- LATE LAYS OUT AS FAR AS SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME OF THE CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE WE'RELOOKING AT HOW THE ROVER PLAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST PROTECTION POSSIBLE -- BETWEEN THOSE TWO LAWS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT ON THE ISSUE OF IN THE LANGUAGE -- THAT WOULD NOT VIOLATE ANY INTERNATIONAL TREATIES OR FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- THE WHERE BILLS DRAFTED IT IT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT PROHIBIT -- THE OFF SHORING -- OF JOBS IN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY SAYS ELIGIBILITY FOR TO CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS OR RESTRICTED SO WE DON'T THINK THAT IT DOES WE'VE HAD LAWYERS LOOK AT IT I SHOULD MENTION THAT I BELIEVE NEW YORK JUST PASS THIS I THINK -- TWO WEEKS AGO NEVADA JUST PASSED A VERSION -- ALABAMA A PAST VERSION AND AND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FIRST VERSION CALIFORNIA'S PASSED. BY PARTISAN IN LOUISIANA AND HAD SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS SO IT'S BEEN LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN THERE ABOUT TWENTY OTHER STATES LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SURE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVE BY SENATOR TO SO -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE WELL I THINK CALIFORNIA SHOULD SUPPORT A CALL CENTER WORKERS IN PRIORITIZE AND PRIORITIZE CALIFORNIA GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES TO CORPORATIONS. THAT RETAIN THEIR CALL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE JOBS TO CALIFORNIANS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AFFECTS JUST ABOUT EVERY CONSUMER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE BUYING AND SELLING OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. LAST YEAR WE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACTOR CCPA WHICH ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO MONITOR. AND CONTROL HOW THE DATA IS BEING YOU SOLD OR OTHERWISE EXCHANGED HOWEVER MANY CONSUMERS DON'T KNOW WHAT BUSINESSES ARE HOLDING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AB TWELVE A TWO WILL REQUIRED DATA BROKERS WHO ARE BUSINESSES THAT BY AN OR SELL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS WITH HOME THEY HAVE NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP.

TWELVE EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN -- MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I ALSO LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS IN IN AND OF THE IMMENSE -- LISTED IN IT IN THE ANALYSIS -- WHICH UPDATE -- WERE THE PHYSICAL SIGNS PLACE AND WHAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON IT. THIS BILL AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WOULD INFORM CONSUMERS WITH A POSTED SIGN. THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OR F. R. T. WHICH IS THE APPLICATION OF BIOMETRICS SOFTWARE USED TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL FROM A DIGITAL IMAGE OR VIDEO FRAMES. OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING EVER MORE PRESENT THROUGHOUT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND CONCERNS OF PRIVACY AND USE OF THE INFORMATION ARE INCREASING. IN FACT A NEW STUDY ALSO RAISES BROADER QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECORDS THE MACHINE LEARNING. ALGORITHMS THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF F. F. R. T. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN INVESTING IN AND ADOPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS RAISING AHEAD OF THE RECENT PUBLICATION DETAIL HOW THE SECURITY MEASURES OF ONE POP STAR INCLUDE. F. R. T. TO CAPTURE THE PICTURES ADDITIONALLY THE EXTENT AND PREVALENCE OF RETAIL STORES USING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR INCREASED MARKETABILITY IS DISTURBING. IT APPEARS THAT IN BOTH CASES INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT INFORMED THAT F. R. T. WAS BEING USED ON THEM NOR WOULD THEY KNOW HOW LONG THE INFORMATION IS HELD AND HOW IT IS USED. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHT EIGHT AB EIGHT TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WAS SIMPLY. ON ME CONSUMERS AWARE OF WHICH BUSINESSES ARE USING FACIAL TECHNOLOGY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ARRIVAL. WHICH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE'D LIKE TO HOBBLE UP HERE. I NEVER KNEW THE GAME OF GOLF WAS SO DANGEROUS. WELL. I GUESS ALL RIGHT OF WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TWO MINUTES PLEASE ASK ME AT THE CORE BUT ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE WILL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME I'LL BE DOING A LITTLE MORE READING THAN I WOULD. TYPICALLY PREFER I'M STANDING IN FOR A COLLEAGUE WHO HAD TO LEAVE ON THIS ISSUE -- WE DO HAVE A FEW CAN BUT CONCERNS ABOUT THE MEASURE -- AS AS MR CHOW RIGHT FULLY ARTICULATED OF FACIAL RECOGNITION IS -- PROLIFIC IN ITS USE IN AN INCREASINGLY SO OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT NUMBER ONE POSTING A SIGN WOULD OFFER LITTLE TO NO PROTECTION AGAINST THE USE OF THIS POWERFUL INTERESTS OF TECHNOLOGY -- WE'RE CONCERNED SUCH SIGNS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IS A BIG COULD ASSENTED NOR DOES PROP SIXTY FIVE NOTICES ARE NOW PARTICULARLY WHEN CONSUMERS HAVE NO EFFECTIVE WAY TO GUARD AGAINST THE DANGERS OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS. AT THE VERY LEAST. ANY PRIVATE DEPLOYMENT OFFICIAL RECOGNITION SHOULD REQUIRE THAT CONSUMERS GIVE AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. AS REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE BY THE ILLINOIS' BIOMETRIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT MOREOVER CONSENT MUST BE INFORMED IN ORDER TO BE MEANINGFUL -- AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE IS WRITTEN PROVIDES NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE CONSENT OF THE NOTICE ASSUMING THAT OF COURSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ IT. AT A MINIMUM ANY SIGN SHOULD NOTIFY THE CONSUMERS OF THE FACTS AND RISKS THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION ALLOWS THEM TO BE TRACKED MONITORED AND THAT THEIR FEES PRINT MAY BE SOLD TO OTHER BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS. AND COMBINED WITH OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE PROFILE OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO IN ADDITION FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH LARGE DATABASES THAT ARE TEMPTING TARGETS FOR COMPUTER HACKERS. AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE RECENT BRIDGE OFFICIAL RECORD DID RECOGNITION DATA COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTIONS EFFECTIVE REGULATION THEREFORE WOULD REQUIRE STRICT LIMITS ON HOW LONG THE DATA CAN BE RETAINED AS WELL AS HOW IT CAN BE USE OR SHARED. FURTHER WE'RE CONCERNED THIS BILL SIGNIFICANTLY BODIES IF NOT UNDER CUTS THE TREATMENT A BIOMETRIC DATA UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT WHICH OF COURSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO IS AN AUTHOR LAST YEAR. PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT POSTING A SIGN IS ALL OF BUSINESS NEED DO WHEN IT USES FACIAL RECOGNITION AND SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER NOTICE THE SIGN PROVIDES IS THE ONLY RIGHT A CONSUMER HAS. THANKFULLY THE CCPA IS SOMEWHAT MORE PROTECTED BY PROVIDING CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO KNOW HOW BIOMETRIC WILL BE USED AND OUR SHARED ALONG WITH OTHER SUB AND HAVE RIGHTS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO DELETE. HOWEVER THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TESTS. OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRING YOU BACK TO THE DíAS CLEARLY -- YOU DON'T DISPROVE THE LAWS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT DOESN'T GO VERY FAR AS FAR AS YOU SEE IT AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE -- BUT IT IS A START. ABOUT AT THE MEAGER -- ONE THE NOTION THAT -- THE BIOMETRIC. DATA IS PROLIFIC I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE JUST STILL TRYING TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND -- I DO HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE CAN STRENGTHEN THIS. OF A LOCKED UP BUT IT IS A START AND I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AT LEAST. STARTING THIS AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THIS ACTUALLY COULD BECOME. A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE CCPA A DOES EXPAND UPON THIS BUT CERTAINLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DOES MOVE THE BALL FORWARD A LITTLE BIT IT IT DOES OFFER SOME BENEFIT. AND I'M SURE THE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE. OF THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AGAIN I I'D LOVE TO SEE A STRONGER BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THAN. THAN NOTHING AT THIS POINT -- SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS -- MOVE BY SENATOR DORADO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. THE BILL THAT CHANGES SLIGHTLY THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. CURRENTLY [inaudible] THE PRESS TAX BOARD ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS A TAX GAP MEETING ABOUT. TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S OWED AND WHAT'S COLLECTED. UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HAS ALREADY RECOVERED ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF IT. BUT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF THE BECAUSE CLAIMS ACTED MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. CLEANING IT UP AND ENCOURAGING IT'S USED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. CLOSE THAT TAX GAP THAT'S WITH THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ON IT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN SAID THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT SEEM TO BE FAIRLY W. LISTS CONCERNS ABOUT. POTENTIALS FOR OTHER LAWSUITS OR MISUSE OF THIS BUT WE THIRTY NARROWLY CONSTRAINED IT. SO THAT IT'S PRETTY THE PROSECUTING AUTHORITY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS IN ITS IT IS BASED ON A WHISTLE BLOWER. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS GOING TO GO AFTER NON TAX PAYERS BUT IT'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY GO AFTER A TAX PAYER. WHERE THERE'S BEEN A WHISTLEBLOWER SHOWING THAT THERE ARE -- TAXES IN THOSE TAXES ARE NOT BEING PAID THAT'S THE WHOLE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIALITY STANDARD MATCHES WITH A RECENT CALIFORNIA COURT CASE AS OPPOSED TO WEAKER STANDARDS TO SEEM TO BE DEVELOPING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THIS PROVIDES CLARITY AROUND THE MATERIALITY STANDARD IT PROVIDES THAT. GIVES THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE ABLE TO USE THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT CLOSE AT TAX CAB. AND ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NOT FALSE CLAIMS BEING MADE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT THEN IS LOSING OUT ON OF TAX AND FRANKLY OTHERWISE IT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING AS A CLOSELY WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THIS TOOL IS IS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT ASK YOUR ABOUT THANK YOU TWO MINUTES EACH. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANTHONY LOU MY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA. THE AG IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWELVE SEVENTY AT THE CRITICAL MEASURE. TO PROTECT PUBLIC DOLLARS IN COMBAT FRAUD AGAINST OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT I'D LIKE. TO SEE THE REST OF MY TIME THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL VIC ACT. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES SIR THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RICK AKRAM IS SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FALSE CLAIMS UNIT -- WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION STRONGLY IT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO GET BACK MONEY FROM THOSE WHO CHEAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SHEET OUR TAXPAYERS. AND TO DETER OTHERS FROM TRYING TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE -- THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT HAS BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR UNIT HAS RECOVERED WELL OVER A ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IS AND AND AS YOU HEARD THE FALSE CLAIMS ENFORCEMENT. WHAT ACROSS THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS RECOVERED OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- AND OUR WORK IS ENTIRELY FUNDED FROM OUR RECOVERIES -- THIS MOMENT AS YOU KNOW GIVES US THE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE TAX FRAUD AND HELP TO CLOSE THE TAX GAP THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE DESCRIBED -- THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT MOTIVATES WHISTLE BLOWERS TO COME FOR THERE'S A LOT OF FRAUD AGAINST THE STATE THAT WOULD NEVER BE DISK I'M COVERED BT FOR WHISTLE BLOWERS COMING FORWARD IN THIS INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO SO. AND IT PROTECTS THEM WHEN THEY DO REFER TAX THEM FOR RETALIATION. I IN FURTHER THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN NARROWLY CRAFTED SO IT ONLY PUNISHES ACTUAL TAX FRAUD. THIS BILL DOES NOT PUNISH INNOCENT MISTAKES IT DOES NOT PUNISH PEOPLE WHO VIGOROUSLY -- VIGOROUSLY CONTEST THEIR TAX BILLS BUT ARE HONEST ABOUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT ONLY PUNISHES PEOPLE WHO COMMIT TAX FRAUD AND THE WE THEREFORE STRONGLY SUPPORTED IT'S BEEN NEARLY DRAFTED WE ALSO. DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD BE SPUR AREAS PRIVATE LAWSUITS BROUGHT -- NEW YORK HAS A SIMILAR STATUTE THAT -- AND THEY HAVE NOT HAD THAT PROBLEM AND WE DO NOT EXPECTED HERE A PLAINTIFF PRIVATE PLAINTIFF BRING LOTS OF NOT THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT A PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS DOING SO. WOULD NEED TO ALLEGE WITH SPECIFICITY. THE ACTUAL FRAUD THERE'S BEEN COMMITTED ACTUAL FACTUAL FALSE STATEMENTS IN IF THEY CANNOT DO SO THEY'RE THEY'RE LAWSUIT WILL BE THROWN OUT IN SHORT ORDER SELF. NEW YORK HAS NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WE WOULD EITHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LET CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES THING NON WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND I MIGHT INDICATE THAT -- AMONG THE OPPOSITION IN ADVERT AND WE LEFT OUT WAS THE A CAL A CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. IN THEIR OPPOSITION AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE TO TESTIFY ON THEIR BEHALF SO YES MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THAT NOTATION MICHAEL LOAD ON BEHALF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION. WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR MISTER STONE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND FOR HIS REPRESENTATIVES BUT THIS IS A PROFOUND. ISSUE THAT GOES TO THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND I THINK IT DESERVES SOME VERY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AND SOME MORE WORK. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE AWESOME POWER OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. THAT ACT PROVIDES FOR TROUBLE DAMAGES. ATTORNEY'S FEES -- IN THIS CASE CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND WHEN EXTENDED TO TAX CASES -- I'VE. I COULD BE WRONG HAVE BEEN WRONG MANY MANY TIMES. BUT I DON'T SEE THE LIMITATIONS IN THE BILL TO TAX FRAUD. AND I DON'T SEE LIMITATIONS IN THE BILL TO WHISTLE BLOWERS THIS THREATENS TO CONVERT REGULAR TAX DISPUTES. WHERE THERE IS A CREDIBLE ARGUMENT ON BOTH SIDES FROM A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR DISPUTE TO A SEVEN FIGURE DISPUTE YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DISPUTE? YOU GET TREBLE DAMAGES ON TOP OF THAT SO NOW YOU'RE. TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AND YOU GET ATTORNEY'S FEES. POSSIBLY DELEGATED TO A PRIVATE LAWYER AND POSSIBLY TO A KEY TâM PLAINTIFF. SO THIS THREATENS TO TAKE A REGULAR TAX DISPUTE. INTO A FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT IS PUTTING TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IN THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE WHEN I WAS YOUNG WE TALKED ABOUT ABUSIVE TAX SHELTERS AND THE LINE BETWEEN A LEGITIMATE TAX DISPUTE AND AN ABUSIVE TAX SHELTER WAS WAS THERE CREDIBLE AUTHORITY FOR THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE TAXPAYER. AND THAT AT LEAST OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED IT SEEMS TO ME INTO THIS BILL SO UNTIL THOSE THINGS ARE RESOLVED AND THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES HERE OF RETROACTIVITY AND OTHERS. BUT WE WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE AND ASK THAT WE CONTINUE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS MADAMCHAIR PAUL THAT FILLED THE REPRESENTING THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE REMARKS OF MISTER BELOW. AND I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND MIKE DID A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WITH THE TAX PORTION. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE EIGHT MATERIALITY STANDARD -- AS WELL AS A CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES -- THE MATERIALITY STANDARD. TRYING NOT TO BE NEBULOUS HERE I KNOW THAT -- CHAIRMAN STONE THIS OF THESE ARGUMENTS WERE NEBULOUS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE A SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY AS THE RATE RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION. CLAIMS AND THESE ARE -- SITUATIONS TO WHERE YOU HAVE CHANGE CONDITIONS THERE'S DISPUTES ALL THE TIME -- WITH BETWEEN THE PUBLIC ENTITY -- AND THE CONTRACTOR OVER -- DISPUTED CLAIMS AND ONE HIT WE SEE FRANKLY IS A LOT OF TIMES A PUBLIC ENTITIES THESE ARE NOT WHISTLEBLOWERS THESE ARE PUBLIC ENTITIES WHO WILL FILE COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR. TO LEVERAGE THEM AGAINST WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS BECAUSE THERE IS IN FACT A DISPUTE SO WE THINK THAT -- THE CODIFYING A COURT CASE THAT HAD THIS VERY SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND USING THAT AS THE NEW STANDARD OF MATERIALITY WHERE YOU GO FROM. OF AN ACTUAL AFFECT TO A POTENTIAL OF FACT HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES IN THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP UP NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. THANK YOU ROBERT MATRICULA CHAMBER WE ARE OPPOSED AS TO THE NOT TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER THE MATERIALITY PROVISIONS BUT AS TO THE CONCERNS THAT GOOD FAITH -- DISAGREEMENTS THANK YOU. MASON LANE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR CHRISTMAS KELLY ON BEHALF OF COUNTY -- SO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ART BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS -- ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE -- IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WOULD RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE MENTIONED. BY THE OPPOSITION HERE -- IN PARTICULAR THE THE CONCERN ABOUT A TAX DISPUTE WHEN IT WHEN IS A TAX DISPUTE TAX FRAUD. AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THOSE CLAIMS AND AND THE ALL ALSO THE ISSUE OF MATERIALITY I NOTICED A NOTE IT IS IN OUR THERE IS A DISCUSSION IN OUR ANALYSES ON THAT BUT IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS IT HERE. AS WELL THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED -- FIRST LET ME ENTERTAIN A MOTION WE HAVE A MOTION CENTER WHITE COLOR SCHEME MOVES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STERN A STONE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I I WILL CLOSE AND I'LL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB DESCRIBING THE MATERIALITY ISSUE. THE PROBLEM IS WE SEE TO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THERE'S A A COURT CASE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS SET THE STANDARD FOR MATERIALITY IN THESE KINDS OF CASES. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL CASES AND IN THAT ARE TAKING IT IN A DIRECTION THAT WOULD BE LESS HELPFUL THAT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO ESTABLISH. TAX FRAUD WE BUY DID PASSING THIS BILL WERE CLARIFYING THAT THE CALIFORNIA RULES ARE GOING TO STAND IT WILL NOT BE DILUTED BY THE FEDERAL RULES. WITH RESPECT TO THE RETROACTIVITY THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS WELL WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE IN THAT THIS IS NOT RETROACTIVE SO WE HAVE. REALLY SOLVED THAT. AND THE THE ISSUE ABOUT. DISPUTES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE CAPTURING HERE THESE ARE FALSE CLAIM SO THERE'S A STANDARD THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ESTABLISH. FOUR EIGHT WHETHER IT NOT A CLAIM IS FALSE AND IF IT IS NOT IF THERE'S A TAXES BE THAT'S HAPPENING IF YOU LOOK AT MOST TAXES BUTTE THE TAXPAYERS OBLIGATED TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. AND DISPUTE THE TAX SO THERE ARE NO DAMAGES THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING REALLY THERE THAT WOULD LEAD TO A FALSE CLAIM. THESE ARE CASES AND WHY WERE WORKING IN THE SPACES BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MOSTLY HEARS ABOUT CASES LIKE THIS UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT THROUGH WHISTLE BLOWERS IF THERE'S TAX FRAUD THAT IS HAPPENING AND IT IS OBVIOUS WHERE THERE'S OTHER EVIDENCE OF IT THAT'S WHERE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. WILL STEP IN. THIS WHOLE STATUE TO SET UP BECAUSE IT WILL BE A WHISTLE BLOWER THAT IS BRINGING FORWARD TO A PROSECUTING AUTHORITY LIKE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HUNDRED QUI TAM LAW AND SAYS THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THEN IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TAKES THAT CASE THEY CAN THEN PROSECUTED SOME THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO WORRIED THAT THE KEY TâM DEFENDANT ON THEIR OWN IS GOING TO INCREASE LITIGATION AND THAT'S WHY I SAY THAT THAT'S A BIT. OF A QUESTIONABLE ARGUMENT. BECAUSE WE'VE SPECIFICALLY MADE SURE THAT THE KEY TâM TO FIND IT ON THEIR OWN DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE TAX RECORD OR ANYTHING THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL IN FACT THE TOURNEY GENERAL WHEN THEY DO GET THOSE TAX RECORDS. TO GO AFTER TAX FRAUD CAN ONLY USE THAT INFORMATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE AND MUST RETAIN THAT INFORMATION AS CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S WHY I SAY WE HAVE NARROWLY CONSTRUE THIS OR DRAFTED THIS SO THAT WE ARE GOING AFTER FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES. THAT THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN ITS THEIR COURSE OF BUSINESS WOULD NORMALLY HAVE ACCESS TO SO WITH THAT I DO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE ABOUT THANK YOU THE MOTION IS. A TO PASS TO SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SO WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. RUSSELL RUSSELL I GONZALEZ JONES. MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN [inaudible] I'M BURKE. NUMBER TO IOWA CASKEY MY CASKEY I'D THE BILL HAS. HAS FIVE VOTER WILL HOLD THE ROLE THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. NEXT STOP IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS WITH FILE ITEM. TWENTY ONE A. B.. THIRTEEN THIRTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON AND IT STILL IS [inaudible] BARELY [inaudible] I THANK. ALL RIGHT OF IN THIS COMMITTEE WE ASK TO TWO WITNESSES -- TWO MINUTES EACH -- SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH SIX TO ENSURE THAT A STUDENT'S FUTURE IS NOT HELD HOSTAGE BY COLLEGES. THE BILL PROHIBITS POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM REFUSING TO PROVIDE A TRANSCRIPT IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE DEBT. COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS ARE CRITICAL DOCUMENTS THEY GIVE STUDENTS MOBILITY TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION -- A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE AND EMPLOYMENT. CURRENT STATE LAW AND EDUCATIONAL POLICY ALLOW SCHOOLS TO WITHHOLD TRANSCRIPTS TO COLLECT THAT. SCHOOLS ARE PUTTING STUDENTS IN A PREDICAMENT WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY PAY OFF THE DEBT. OUR NATIONAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT EXCEEDS ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS THIS AMOUNT IS MORE THAN ALL OF OUTSTANDING CREDIT CARD DEBT. ANOTHER REPORT A REPORT BY THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION HIGHLIGHTED THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME GRADUATES ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THERE WILL THAN THEIR WHITE AND WEALTHIER PEERS. THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING STUDENT TRANSCRIPTS IS MORE LIKELY. HARMING OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. WITH ALL OF THE BURDENS ALREADY FACE SEEN OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF WE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PAY OFF DEBT. INSTEAD WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING WAYS TO REDUCE THE ENCUMBRANCE OF PAYING IT OFF. AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN REMOVES ONE OF THESE BARRIERS OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING FROM PAYING OFF THEIR STUDENT DEBT -- IT TODAY IN TO FURTHER SPEAK ON THIS BILL I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE SPONSOR OFTHIS BILL. I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE MARTIN. RED DOSE OF EACH OTHER AND BERNARD ESKIN DARI. THANK YOU IN JUST A REMINDER WE HAVE. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH AND THEN ADD ON SO IF. IF YOU WANT THREE WITNESSES YOU NEED STAFF THIS IS MY STAFF YES OKAY THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. PARTNER DAS VIGIL A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA -- WE WHAT WOULD PROUD SPONSORS OF AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH RESTRICTS POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING STUDENT TRANSCRIPTS -- AS A MEANS OF DEBT COLLECTION. AND WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR INTRODUCING THE BILL I HAVE WITH ME BARNEY ASKING DARI HE'S A SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN OUR CONSUMER LAW SECTION -- WITH WE DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR THE BILL AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. MISTER ASKING DARI WAS ON THE TEAM THAT PROSECUTED CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WHICH RESULTED IN A IN A BILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT THANK. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS BORN ASKING DARIA SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. TRANSCRIPT WITHHOLDING IS TOO POTENT OF A TOOL FOR ANY SCHOOL TO USED TO COLLECT THE DATA. IT'S REALLY TRANSCRIPT EXTORTION. TRANSCRIPTS ARE CRITICAL STUDENT RECORDS YOU NEED A TRANSCRIPT TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. TO GET INTO A GRADUATE PROGRAM IT'S OFTEN REQUIRED FOR LICENSURE PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE OR EVEN TO GET A JOB. WHEN A SCHOOL WITH HOLD A STUDENT'S TRANSCRIPT TO RESTRAIN STUDENT CHOICE MOBILITY AND POTENTIALLY THEIR LIVELIHOOD? THE PRACTICE IS ALSO COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WITHOUT A JOBBER CONTINUED EDUCATION STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO PAY BACK DEBT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TYPE OF SCHOOL USES THIS THAT COLLECTION TECHNIQUE. THE SCHOOL IS LEGITIMATE PREDATORY NONPROFIT PROPRIETARY EVERY TIME IT'S USED ITS ABUSE. THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT THIS IS JUST A WAY TO START A CONVERSATION SCHOOLS HAVE A NUMBER OF LESS OPPRESSIVE WAYS TO START THIS CONVERSATION. FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS CAN SUSPEND LIBRARY OR REGISTRATION PRIVILEGES THEY CAN WITHHOLD CURRENT GRADES -- BEGIN WITH OLD GRADUATION OR EVEN GREEK AND FOR ALL THE BILL WOULD STOP SCHOOLS FROM DOING NONE OF THIS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE AT THE MERCY OF THEIR SCHOOL TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES -- I WANT TO KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF FROM HABIT ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE NINE ANY OPPOSITION. THING THEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS -- I'M SORRY YOUR GOT TO BE FAST IN THIS PLACE OKAY YEAH. THANK YOU SO TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH THANK YOU SENATOR -- TYLER I YOU ARE B. F. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- FOR PRIORITIZE IN THIS IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED TO HIGHLIGHTTHE FACT THAT YOU SEE IS VERY WELL AWARE AND KEENLY AWARE ACTUALLY OF THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS -- WE DO I BELIEVE THIS IS A WAY THAT WE CAN START A CONVERSATION WITH OUR STUDENTS. TYPICALLY -- WILL WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND SURVEYED EVERY SINGLE -- ONE NINE DIRECTLY REFUSE THE THE OFFER THE TRANSCRIPT -- THAT WITH HOLE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T IS WILL HOLD IT FOR NO REASON -- EACH FOR CAMPUSES WILL -- EITHER DO A ONE TIME RELEASE -- WORK WITH THE STUDENTS TO COME UP WITH SOME -- REASONABLE DOWN PAYMENT SO THE PAYMENT CAN BE -- THE TRANSCRIPT RELEASED. AGAIN IF IF THIS -- THIS BILL IS SORT OF TARGET I THINK AT LEAST FROM THAT FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD AT THE FOR PROFITS -- AND LIKE THE TESTIMONY HAD MENTIONED WE HAVE EMPLOYED THIS METHOD ALONG WITH -- WITHHOLDING OF DIPLOMAS AND REGISTRATION OBVIOUSLY REGISTRATION BEING THE MOST COMMON DIPLOMAS ALSO BEING MORE COMMON. BUT THIS METHOD IT WILL ULTIMATELY TO THE SITUATION WHERE WE CANNOT COLLECT DEBTS VIA TRANSCRIPTS AND WE JUST HAVE -- TO THEN SEND THOSE DEBTS -- TO MOST LIKELY A THIRD PARTY COLLECTIONS AGENCY SO WE PREFER WE WE WE WORK WITH THE STUDENT -- AS THE DEAD EXISTS -- IN THE UNIVERSITY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO WRITE OFF THOSE DEBTS AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES -- ALEX GRAVES WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF AND CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES REPRESENT A FOR PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IN THE STATE I APOLOGIZE IF THIS YEAR'S MISSING A WE ALSO I'M TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO FALL OUT OF IT IS -- BUT I I CAN MANAGE. SO I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE. NO WE WE FULLY SUPPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING YOUR DEGREE IN GETTING IN THE WORK FORCE WITH THIS LITTLE THAT IS POSSIBLE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE. THIS AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHERE THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN ABUSED IS IN THE FOR PROFIT SECTOR -- AND YOU KNOW -- LAKE MCCUMBER YOU SEE OUR SCHOOLS -- WHEN WE SURVEYED THEM? NOTED A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT THEY TRY TO WORK WITH STUDENTS THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS -- WHETHER THE YEAH THAT'S CONSTANTINA CATION TO SEE IF AS SOON AS A HARDSHIP IN IF THEY NEED TO DELAY OR COMFORT ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS -- THEY YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO WITHHOLD REGISTRATION BUT FRANKLY NUMBER OF OUR SCHOOLS OF INDICATED THEY DON'T LIKE TO USE THAT TACTIC BECAUSE THAT SLOWS DOWN A STUDENTS PROGRESS TOWARDS A DEGREE. AT SLOWS DOWN THERE YOU KNOW -- THEIR TIME GRADUATION WHICH ARE IT IS NOT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STUDENT -- OR OR THE IN -- THE UNIVERSITY -- AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW OUR OUR SCHOOLS YOU WORK WITH THE STUDENTS AND PROVIDE THIS FLEXIBILITY AND TRY TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT WHILE THE STUDENTS ENROLLED. YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS PRIMARY MISSION AND MOTIVATION IS PRODUCE GRADUATES IT'S NOT TO PRODUCE PROFITS -- YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN ADDITIONAL GRADUATION RATES BY SLOWING US INSIDE A DEGREE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO. YOU KNOW ADD TO THE NOTE OF YOU KNOW WITH HOLDING DIPLOMAS PREVENTS IS GETTING JOBS YEAH WE ALSO ARE MEASURED AGAINST OUR OUR STUDENT DEFAULT RATES. NEWS NUMBER MEASUREMENTS -- THE OUR SCHOOLS YOU KNOW ARE ARE ASSESSED AGAINST IN TERMS OF STUDENTS ARE GETTING IN THE WORK FORCE SO. COLLECTIONS YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S AN OPTION ON THE BACK AND AND I WAS GONNA SAY THAT'S NOT THE PREFERRED MECHANISM FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS -- FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO COLLECTIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW BEING AN ADVERSE MARK ON STUDENTS CREDIT SCORE POTENTIALLY SCHOOLS ARE ONLY RECOUPING TO THE NATURE OF HOW COLLECTIONS -- OTHERS COLLECTORS GET PAID IS BETTER RECOUPING HEAR THE TIMER GOING OFF SO ALL STOP IT. A SUBTLE REMINDER. WHEN YOU'RE ALMOST IT'S HARD TO MISS? I WOULD LIKE SO THAT YOU DON'T FALL IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND -- GIFT REPLACING WILL REPLACE THAT SHARE. HERE'S THE HERE'S THE HERE'S THE WILL OF AND AND THERE IS THE ONE WITH THE ELECTRONIC CHARGES AND IT IS SAID THAT NO IT'S THE CHECK HER SEE THAT SHE CHECKED OR SEE. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STEP FOR WITH YOUR OF TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS SENATOR BORCHERS. I CAN ONLY PROVIDE THE ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE -- WENT TO SCHOOL OF CAMBRIDGE AND IN DC AREA. AND I TRIED TO GET A TRANSCRIPT AND I COULDN'T THERE WAS APPARENTLY A LIEN ON MY ACCOUNT CALL THEM UP. AND THEY SAID YOU OWES THREE DOLLARS FOR YOUR TRANSCRIPT THAT YOU ORDERED EARLIER. AND I GO BUT I NEED RIGHT NOW. AND PAYING BY CREDIT CARD FOR THE PHONE WAS AN OPTION. AND THEN I REALIZED. HOW PROFOUND THAT IMBALANCES? THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOWN STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT IN REPAYMENT OPTIONS I'M TALKING ABOUT BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES WHAT'S. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT NGUYEN IN INSTITUTION. THAT YOU HAVE. INVESTED IN CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES -- TOWARD IS TELLING YOU THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK BECAUSE OF THREE DOLLARS THERE'S AN IMBALANCE. AND I THINK I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- ARE THERE ARE EXTREMES IN INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUALS HAVE -- CREATED TO DIFFICULTIES IN -- IN NOT HONORED THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNIVERSITIES YES -- BUT FROM MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU. CREATE IMPEDIMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET YOUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT IF YOU STAND IN THEIR WAY COMPLETELY IN THAT REGARD SO WITH THAT I'LL BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THIS. OR IN ARE ACTUALLY NOT IN SUPPORT BUT ANY OTHER ANY OTHER -- MEMBERS -- WISH TO RESPONSE IN A WORKOUT SKIN IN A CENTER ON BURKE I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORED THAT THE DIPLOMAS CAN STILL BE WITHHELD AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A BIG THING WHEN YOU GRADUATE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO GET YOUR DIPLOMA. AND WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. I THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED AS ANOTHER WAY THAT. THE SCHOOLS CAN -- COLLECT THAT. RIGHT I MEAN YEAH. TRANSCRIPT REALLY CREATE THE POWER IMBALANCE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE KEY TO STOKE STUDENT MOBILITY IT'S THE IT'S THE MEMORIALIZATION OF THE COURSE WORK THAT'S BEEN COMPLETED. THE DIPLOMA DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SORT OF A MOBILITY IMPEDIMENTS THAT THE TRANSCRIPT OFFERS. SO IT'S IT'S STILL STICK THAT CAN BE USED TIMES FOR A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE STICK BUT IT'S NOT AS BIG AS THE TRANSCRIPTS TECH PROBABLY INEFFECTIVE STICK TO ONE'S PARENTS OR FOR ONCE. RENTS AS COMPARED TO THE TRANSCRIPT -- I'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY -- DIPLOMAS OF PEOPLE HANG ON THE BACK OF THEIR BATHROOMS -- BUT THE TRANSCRIPTS OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME. SIGNIFICANCE TO MOST PEOPLE. THANK YOU A SENATOR UMBERG THE MANAGER I I JUST WANT UNDERSTAND UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITION. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITION IS IS THAT IF A STUDENT. OWES A DEBT. AND THEN A STUDENT IS APPLYING FOR A JOB IN NEEDS THAT TRANSCRIPT IN ORDER TO GET A JOB TO PAY THAT THAT. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITIONS THEY CAN'T GET THE TRANSCRIPT RIGHT RIGHT YEAH NO SO THAT AND I WANT TO I WANTTO MAKE SURE THEY EMPHASIZE THAT THIS SITUATION WERE TALKING ABOUT AND WE CAN HAVE TO GO BACK AND TEXTUALLY TO LOOK AT THE THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL WHICH IS. THAT WE HEARD IN LAST TESTIMONY LAST COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS A CURRENT IN COLLEGE THAT ACTUALLY WAS PULLING STUDENTS OUT OF CLASS. FOR NOT PAYING DEBTS SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING A BIG DELINEATION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT THE PROCESS IS SUCH THAT IF A STUDENT FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES. IS SAYING THAT THEY NEED A JOB AND THE THE TRANSCRIPT THEY ASKED WITH EMPLOYEES EMAIL THEY SEND THE TRANSCRIPT RECORD OF EMPLOYER. THE DEATH NOT PAID STILL -- WE PUT IN THE COST ESTIMATE OF ANY ABOUT ONLY GOOD HOLES THAT WE HAVE THE UC SYSTEM IS AN ESTIMATE. OR TALKING ABOUT MILLION DOLLARS SO WE LIKE TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT STUDENTS ARE IN A BIND SOMETIMES SO WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH STUDENTS ON EVERY SINGLE CASE LIKE HAD MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY AT THE LETTER AS WELL BUT BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S THE IDEA. THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A A QUITE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. OKAY I I GET THERE'S WORST DEFENDERS. WE PROBABLY CAN STIPULATE THERE'S WORST OFFENDERS THE WORST OFFENDERS THAN THAN YOU'RE SICK OF ME BUT I JUST I WANT TO MAKE. I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS POSITION IS IF YOU OWE MONEY YOU DON'T GET A TRANSCRIPT RIGHT -- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S THE POSITION THAT WE HAVE I THINK IS THAT WE WOULD PREFER TAT THE DEBT WE WOULD LIKE TO COLLECT THAT THAT AND THEN RELEASED A TRANSCRIPT YES THIS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN UTILIZED BY ALL INSTITUTIONS AND ALL CALIFORNIA FOR AS LONG AS IT'S BEEN AROUND OKAY. THAT'S NOW I UNDERSTAND ARE. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE. MOTION BY SENATOR MINING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW WAS -- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM A I SEE SEE YOU MENTIONED IN HIS TESTIMONY THE MISSION OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNIVERSITIES IS TO PRODUCE GRADUATES NOT PROFIT -- AND I THINK OUR OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR MISSION IS YOU KNOW TO NOT PUT THESE BARRIERS SELECT. SENATOR BOARD JUST MENTIONED OVER THREE DOLLARS NOT RELEASE A TRANSCRIPT WHEN NEEDED -- AND AND SO THAT'S WHY I AM PROUD TO BE -- OF AUTHOR THIS BILL I YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT OUR SCHOOLS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON SERVING STUDENTS -- AND NOT ACTING LIKE THEY'RE IT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THERE IS NO DATA -- YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T TRACKED -- HOW MANY SCHOOLS AND HOW MANY CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OUR -- UNIVERSITIES IN THE UC HAS AN ESTIMATE THAT THEY WOULD LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- BUT WE DON'T COLLECT THE DATA SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM AND HOW IT COULD BE PRODUCED SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE MOTION THE BY CENTER MONNING IS TO PASS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS I WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IT JUST BEYOND UNDERSTANDING THAT. ONE TRANSCRIPT WOULD BE HELL BECAUSE YOU MAY OWE A FEW DOLLARS TO THE SCHOOL. AND AGAIN OTHER OTHER WAYS TO COLLECT THAT MONEY. SO WITH THAT -- MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY ONE AB HIRTEEN THIRTEEN JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS. OR DECIDE TO RUSSELL TO RUSSELL I'D GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES JONES I'M MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. I'M BURKE. NUMBER I Y. CASKEY. I CASKEY AYE ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- WE'VE GOT TWO BILLS LEFT WE'VE GOT -- EXCUSE ME THREE BILLS -- WILL GO NOW TO FILE ITEM TWENTY TWO A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER NECESSARY AND THEN WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA -- SO I HOPE THAT THEY ARE WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE AND WILL BE COMING. TO HELP US CLOSE OUT. A AS SOON AS WE POSSIBLY CAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY WOULD REQUIRE THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND CAL STARS TO DIVEST PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUNDS FROM AND ANY INVESTMENT VEHICLE OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. THE LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENTS IN TURKEY IS CONTINGENT UPON THE PASSAGE OF A FEDERAL LAW. ISSUING SANCTIONS AGAINST TURKEY FOR FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THIS CONTINGENCY CLAUSE IN SHORES CALIFORNIA'S POLICY TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH PASSED THE VESTMENTS FROM FOREIGN NATIONS INCLUDING SADAN AND IRAN. IN THAT PURRS AND STIRS WILL NOT DIVEST UNTIL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION FIRST. ALSO THIS BILL INCLUDES A PROVISION PROTECTING THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS BY STATING ACTIONS TAKEN TO ALIGN WITH THIS BILL. ARE NOT REQUIRED IF THEY VIOLATE THE BOARD'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES. FURTHER THERE IS A PROVISION AND THEM TO FIND THE BOARDS AND EMPLOYEES FROM CLAIMS BROUGHT FORTH. BY ACTIONS TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS BILL. OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY'S UNWILLINGNESS TO RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE AND THEIR UNRELENTING CAMPAIGN TO THE NIGHT THAT GENOCIDE. CONTINUES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ARMENIANS GREEKS AND THE SYRIANS. WHO SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT THE FORMER OTTOMAN EMPIRE? A JOINING ME TODAY. IS MISS HELEN HAGUE WITH THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION THANK YOU TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY HAS A LETTER AND REPORT ON FILE IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY I JUST WANT TO MENTION TO HIGHLIGHTS VERY BRIEFLY. FIRST OF ALL AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW OUR LATE GOVERNOR GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOUGHT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA. BY PROMOTING DIVESTITURE. AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS HIS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR POLICY IN HIS OFFICE. AND WITNESSED THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE AND OPPOSITION BUT HE STOOD HIS GROUND. IT DID BECOME CALIFORNIA DIVESTITURE POLICY AND THEN HE WENT ON TO WORK WITH MAXINE WATERS. AND IN A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THEY GOT IT THROUGH BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS IT BECAME US. POLICY AND I BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES THAT THERE HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE AND EFFECTIVE. PRESIDENT FOR DIVESTITURE OF THIS KIND. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT I AM VESTED IN PURRS AND TALK FREQUENTLY WITH MANY PEERS AND COLLEAGUES. STATEWIDE FROM MANY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND WE SMPLY DO NOT WANT OUR DOLLARS. BEING INVESTED IN TURKISH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF GENOCIDE SURVIVORS MY PARENTS WERE VERY YOUNG. I HAVE MEMORIES OF BEING AWAKENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. BY MY MOTHER'S BLOOD CURDLING SCREAMS BECAUSE SHE HAD NIGHTMARES. RELIVING WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH AS A CHILD. I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO HEAR THAT KIND OF SCREAMING AGAIN. THERE MANY MANY STORIES I CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE HUMAN COSTS OF GENOCIDE. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS WE ARE COMPELLED TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING. AND THAT MEANS PREVENTING GENOCIDE WHERE WE CAN AND THAT INCLUDES. HOLDING PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE IN WHATEVER WAY WE CAN. SO WHEN WE PUT THE ISSUES OF OUR HUMANITY NEXT TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF INVESTING IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS ON GOING GENOCIDAL POLICIES. INCLUDING AS I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THE MASSACRE OF THE KURDS CURRENTLY A DOCUMENT SUPPORT FOR ISIS WE HAVE ABSOLUTE CLARITY AS TO WHY WE ARE SUPPORTING. AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FULLY AS REFERRED THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD. TWO MINUTES PLEASE OR LESS. THANK YOU. AND WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENGAGEMENT IS A MORE EFFECTIVE BALANCE THAN MANDATORY TO PASS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND WHEN YOU SAY ENGAGEMENT WOULD YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THAT IS. ABSOLUTELY -- WHEN WE TALKED -- TO PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS -- INVESTORS WHO WANT TO WORK ON OUR BEHALF AND OUR OUR STAFF -- DIRECTLY TALKING TO BUSINESSES THE CIGAR INVESTMENT -- BRING UP THESE ISSUES -- BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE USING SHAREHOLDER POWER. THAT'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS CENTER BORCHERS. THANK YOU -- GERMAN I WANT TO COMMEND -- THE AUTHOR. SHOULD A COLUMN AND GET -- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS SIDE OF FORD. NORMALLY I WOULDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN. SO DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THERE ARE I THINK ARE COMPELLING -- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANTED GIVEN THAT WERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD OUR INVESTMENTS EXPRESS OUR PRIORITIES NOT ONLY AS A STATE BUT REFLECT UPON THE NATION. AND I THINK UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'D FORGIVE ME FOR REFERENCING YOUR EARLIER COMMENT OF ENGAGEMENT. THERE'S NO ENGAGEMENT. ON THIS ISSUE. IF THERE WERE. LAST HUNDRED AND FOUR YEARS WHAT APPROVED A DIFFERENT RESULT -- AND WHAT I'VE SEEN AT A BIRD A ONE AND THE ENTIRE POSTURE OF THE REPUBLIC. OF IRELAND. THEY WILL NOT -- REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION TO ALL -- ALL OVERTURES TO TRY TO CREATE IN RIGHT. S. ORACLE RECORD. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. SO I FULLY SUPPORT THE SAY. THIS IDEA DIVESTING FROM AN ENTITY THAT HAS NO INTEREST IN. ACCOUNTABILITY IT HAS NO INTEREST IN LOOKING AT THE LARGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES -- WE'VE SEEN. I ITS DEVIATION FROM THE WEST AND I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING ANYTIME SOON -- BUT I WON'T DEL TOO MUCH INTO FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXCEPT THAT IT'S AT OUR DOORSTEP. AND WITH THAT I WOULD FULLY SUPPORT THE DIVESTMENT OF CALPERS IN OUR CALIFORNIA RELATED INVESTMENTS. INTO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT DESERVE. OUR OUR INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU SENATOR TO RUSSELL. YES I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- AND THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF FOR BRINGING THIS UP I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT A LITTLE ARMENIA IN SENATE DISTRICT -- TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER ONE MILLION ARMENIANS. AND WE HAVE BEEN STRONG. IN SUPPORTING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE RECOGNITION AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF ARTS ARE -- THIS BILL CONTINUES AS YOU MENTION CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ACT. APPROPRIATELY AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT HAVE. A RECORD OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY SO. I EXPECTED CALIFORNIA -- WE JUST REMIND US THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF DIVESTMENT. ON NOT ONLY SOUTH AFRICA BUT THROUGH DOWN AND I EXPECT THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE. TO STAND ON THE SIDE NOT JUST OF THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY BUT ALL. JUST AS LOVING PEOPLES OF THE WORLD -- AND AGAINST THAT AND JUSTICE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU US CENTER ON BURKE FALL BY SENATOR MONEY. JUST JUST VERY BRIEFLY A SETTLEMENT MEMBER MEMBER IN THIS AREA -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU SHOULD TURKEY TAKE THAT FIRST STEP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORIC REALITY GENOCIDE TO PERHAPS BRING THAT SOMETHING BACK SO WE CAN RECONSIDER. BUT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGES WHAT WAS HISTORIC FACT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN -- ENGAGE WITH THAT COUNTRY I TAKE THE POINT THAT THE ENGAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE AS A STATE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A SEPARATE. ISSUE -- KIANA SHOULD ENGAGE SO I COMMEND YOU IN SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TO JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND I THINK THE WAY YOU CRAFTED THIS RECOGNIZING THAT. FOREIGN POLICY IS IN THE PROVINCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I THINK IT'S A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH IT PUTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON RECORD RECOGNIZES. THE OFFICIAL FORM POLICY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATE INCENTIVIZE HIS. ACTION AT THAT LEVEL SO THANK YOU INTO YOUR WITNESS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SIR MOTION THE MOVE. ALREADY THE SENATOR BORCHERS HAS MOVED AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DESIRING YOU MAY CLOSE. UP THANK YOU BYE BYE I THINK THE COLLECTIVE COMMENTS SHOULD SERVE AS A WONDERFUL CLOSE TO THIS SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID AND AND TO TO SENATOR MUNNINGS POINT IT'S IT'S EXACTLY. WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WAS NOT TO COMPROMISE CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST OR CALIFORNIANS INTEREST? BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO STE SEND A STRONG MESSAGE ABSENT THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE -- AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CLASS RIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION TO DO PASS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS.
