A TIME WHEN THE THE STATE BUDGET

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.757
AND IN THAT.

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:00.258
THE LEGISLATURE HAD BECOME

BUT THE LEGISLATURE WAS

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:23.415
UNDETERRED AND STE WHEN I HAD AN

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.017
ESTABLISHED OUR OFFICE THROUGH A

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.185
JOINT RULE BETWEEN THE SENATE

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.354
AND THE ASSEMBLY.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.923
AND I DO THINK IT IS A YOU KNOW

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.126
TESTAMENT TO THE VALUE OF THE

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:35.927
FUNCTION OF OUR OFFICE THAT NOW

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:37.362
ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE SOME

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:38.864
VERSION OF THE LEGISLATIVE

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.433
FISCAL OFFICE.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.302
AND AS MR TING MENTIONED THAT

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:47.005
THE OFFICE IS THE MODEL THAT THE

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:48.974
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET BUDGET

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:49.941
OFFICE WAS --

00:21:50.008 --> 00:21:53.278
BASED ON SO OUR OUR MISSION AS A

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:55.080
PURSUANT TO THE JOINT RULE THAT

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.449

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:58.483
ASCERTAIN FACTS AND MAKE

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.751

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.765
THINK A SUMMARY WAY TO SAY THAT

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.702

AND ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.242
YOU EXPRESSED THAT IS THROUGH

THIS ONE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.996
OF ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.131
THIS IS ONE WHERE WE ARE NOT

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:30.188
WHEN THEY MAKE IT TO THE BALLOT.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:34.259
WE PROVIDE A SUMMARY ANALYSIS.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:35.460
OF THE ANALYSIS IS IT A FISCAL

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.462
IMPACT ASSESSMENT SO WHAT IS THE

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:39.698
FISCAL IMPACT OF THE INITIATIVE

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:41.499
ON US ON THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:42.267
GOVERNMENTS.

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.469
AND ALSO A SUMMARY WRITTEN IN

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.671
PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT VOTERS CAN

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:49.374
UNDERSTAND OF WHAT IT YES OR NO

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:54.980
VOTE MIGHT MEAN IN THAT CASE.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:58.116
OKAY SO MOVING TO PAGE.

00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.851
THREE HERE IS THE WAY TO THINK

00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.920
ABOUT THIS SLIDE IS REALLY THIS

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:03.388
IS HOW WE DELIVER ON THE

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.457
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT I JUST

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.425
MENTIONED ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE.

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.294
WE DELIVER IN TWO MAIN WAYS PULL

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.262
THROUGH A WRITTEN PRODUCTS BUT

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.598
THEN ALSO IN OUR OTHER TYPES OF

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.600
SUPPORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE FEES

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.235
THE OTHER TYPES WHICH I'LL JUST

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.337
MENTION HERE QUICKLY.

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.171
ARE LISTED AT THE BOTTOM BUT

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.607
THEIR YOU KNOW TO PROVIDING A

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:25.977
TESTIMONY THAT HEARINGS.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.346
SUPPORTING YOUR STAFF'S AS YOU

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:30.782
DEVELOP THE AS THEY DEVELOP THE

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.584
AGENDA IS FOR THE HEARINGS

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.285
THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET CYCLE.

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.453
AND JUST PROVIDING A GENERAL

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.955
RESOURCE TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:40.325
YEAR AT ANY POINT WE ALSO FIELD

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:41.526
AND RESPOND TO QUESTIONS FROM

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:43.361
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:45.263
LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGET PROCESS

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.331
AND WE THINK OF THAT IS

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.366
HOPEFULLY A SERVICE TO YOU.

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:50.702
AS WELL.

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.138
UP ABOVE I HAVE PROVIDED A TABLE

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:54.806
TO USE THAT TALLIES THE KEPT

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.441
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF THE

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.809
WRITTEN PRODUCTS THAT OUR OFFICE

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.378
HAS PRODUCED OVER THE LAST TWO

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:02.213
YEARS.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.515
I WOULD LIKE TO DRY YOUR

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:06.718
ATTENTION TO THE FOOTNOTE AND

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:08.920
THE TOP ONE IN PARTICULAR.

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.221
THIS IS --

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.956
AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED WE WOULD

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.092
RESPOND.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.895
TO SOME OF THE REQUESTS --

00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:18.263
FORWARD SPENDING AUTHORITY

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.531
OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:20.398
THROUGH --

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.600
THAT COME IN THROUGH THESE

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.335
BUDGET NOTIFICATION LETTERS.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:25.570
BUT WE REALLY ONLY GOING TO

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:26.504
RAISE.

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.440
A FLAG OR A POINTED OUT TO YOU

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:29.908
AND IT WITH A WRITTEN RESPONSE

00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:31.476
IN TIMES AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.445
REQUEST IS INCONSISTENT WITH

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.647
PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:37.315
THERE'S SOMETHING QUESTIONABLE

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.683
ABOUT THE TIMING OF IT.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.918
MEANING THIS SEEMS LIKE IT COULD

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:42.654
BE SO WITH DURING THE REGULAR

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.756
BUDGET PROCESS SOMETHING LIKE

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:45.056
THAT.

00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:47.792
SO -- THAT'S

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.494
I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.096
ANOTHER OBSERVATION ABOUT THIS

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.164
TABLE IS WHAT IF YOU SAW THESE

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:55.133
NUMBERS OVER TIME OVER LONGER

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.768
THAN JUST A TWO YEAR PERIOD I

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.536
THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS WERE USING

00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:00.171
MORE AND MORE.

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:02.474
OUR ECONOMY AND TAX BLOG AND

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.242
OTHER WEB POSTINGS.

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.544
SO I THINK THE THE TREND WILL BE

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:08.012
AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE IN

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:09.114
THIS DIRECTION.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.349
PROVIDING SORT OF A REAL TIME

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:14.252
ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.688
KEY ASPECTS OF THE STATE BUDGET

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.523
REVENUE COLLECTIONS --

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.358
EXPENDITURE TRENDS.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.494
AND I THINK THIS PLATFORM IS

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.730
PROBABLY A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:27.599
IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:30.235
AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:32.904
SPECIFICALLY MENTION ABOUT THIS

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.539
PAGE IS TO THE ONE CALLED OTHER

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.740
REPORTS.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:37.408
NOW THIS IS WHERE.

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.944
THE THE REPORTS THAT WE DECIDE

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:41.813
WITHIN THE OFFICE WARRANT SENATE

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.148
DID SOME SOME ISSUE WARRANTS

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:45.250
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IN THAT WE

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:45.917
SHOULD RIGHTS READ A REPORT

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.051
ABOUT IT.

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.119
AND SO YOU CAN SEE I WANTED TO

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:50.121
PROVIDE THIS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:53.158
OF ALL OF OUR WRITTEN PRODUCTS.

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.759
A LITTLE BIT OF A FEEL.

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.794
FOR WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF EACH

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.130
OF THESE CATEGORIES IS AND SO

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.232
HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:04.269
OKAY SO MOVING TO THE FOURTH

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:04.769
PAGE.

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:08.573
THIS SLIDE IS DESCRIPTION OF OUR

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.409

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:12.277
TO YOU.

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:14.212
CURRENTLY THE OFFICE HAS FORTY

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.548
ONE ANALYST WHICH INCLUDES THE

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:18.383

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:20.451
HAVE THREE MANAGING PRINCIPAL

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:21.886
ANALYST.

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:24.088
THE OFFICE IS ORGANIZED INTO

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.523
FOUR SECTIONS EACH SECTION

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.027

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:30.728
AND THE SECTIONS A LINE WITH THE

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:34.299
KEY AREAS OF THE STATE BUDGET SO

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:41.573
AND THE A SECTION THAT COVERS

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:44.475
THE CORRECTIONS TRANSPORTATION

AND ENVIRONMENT.

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.513
I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.848
THAT AFTER HAVING BEEN THERE FOR

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.717
YOU KNOW THE SIX WEEKS.

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.018
I CAN TELL ALREADY THAT THERE'S

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:56.921
A VERY BIG EMPHASIS PUT ON

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:59.991
BRINGING NEW STAFF AND THE

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.659
YOUNGER NINOS LESS TENURED

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:03.194
ANALYSTS.

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:06.364
INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY ON

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:06.965
THE AREAS OF THE BUDGET THAT

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.266
THEY COVER.

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.767
THERE'S A VERY.

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.469
HIGH CAN SAY COMPARED WITH MY

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.304
PREVIOUS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.372
THEY HAVE A VERY ROBUST

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:16.174
ONBOARDING PROCESS AND I WAS

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:19.277
VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT I THINK

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:19.444
IT.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.813
SERVES YOU WELL I HOPE.

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:24.015
A AND THEN ON THE LAST PAGE I

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:26.150
THOUGHT I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:29.420
FOR YOU A COUPLE OF MY TOP

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:31.256
PRIORITIES FOR THIS FIRST TWELVE

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:32.924
MONTHS OR SO.

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:34.626
I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT FIND THAT

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.227
THERE'S SOME ALIGNMENT WITH SOME

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:37.895
OF THE COMMENTS THAT --

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:39.097
HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE OPENING

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.398
REMARKS HERE.

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:41.699
BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE THAT I

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:44.002
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS EXPAND OUR

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:47.305
MEMBER AND STAFF COMMUNICATIONS.

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:49.907
NOW FOR ME WHAT THIS MEANS IS IN

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.342
THE FIRST PHASE REALLY JUST

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.778
SETTING UP OUTREACH MEETINGS TO

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.280
TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I'VE MET

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:57.448
EACH OF YOU AND OTHER

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.450
LEGISLATORS.

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:02.287
AND SOME OF YOUR STAFF MEMBERS.

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:04.789
AND WHILE I THINK THAT'S VERY

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.691
IMPORTANT I THINK THERE ISN'T A

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.393
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.328
OF THE PERSON IN MY SEAT TO NOT

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.263
JUST ESTABLISH THOSE

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.564
RELATIONSHIPS BUT TO MAKE SURE

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.267
THAT THEY ARE ROBUST AN ON GOING.

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:18.269
SO THAT'S JUST SORT OF THEFIRST

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:21.472
PHASE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.274
A DIALOGUE WITH YOU IS WHAT I'M

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.876
TRYING TO SAY.

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.845
AND THE WAY THE ONE IMPORT IT

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:29.347
WOULD BE --

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:30.915
EXPERIENCED I THINK IS THROUGH

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.417
THE SECOND BULLET POINT HERE

00:32:32.483 --> 00:32:35.086
WHICH IS. TO INCREASE OUR OUT

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.255
REACH PARTICULARLY DURING THE

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.790
PHASE WHEN WE ARE DEVELOPING A

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.391
RESEARCH AGENDA SO I'VE

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:41.559
MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.094
THROUGHOUT THIS THE PART ABOUT

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:44.962
WHERE WE HAVE SOME REPORTS THAT

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:48.299
WE DO ON A SELF INITIATED BASIS.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:51.302
I WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY OF MY

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:53.104
TENURE TO ENSURE THAT.

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.373
THOSE KIND OF RESEARCH REPORTS

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.208
ARE.

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.576
RELEVANT TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.812
THERE ARE TIMELY AND IMPORTANT

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:02.513
TO CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S JUST

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.549
ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES AND I

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:06.184
THINK WE'RE GOING --

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.353
TO KIND OF DO THAT BY HOPEFULLY

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:10.421
BRINGING OVER.

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.156
THE DEPUTIES ALONG WITH ME TO

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.658
ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION SOME

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.993
BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS IF YOU

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.295
WILL JUST TO HAVE.

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:19.263
SO THE YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.665
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.900
AND HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOUR

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.470
PRIORITIES ARE DIRECTLY.

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:26.938
ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY AS AN ASIDE

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.506
I CAN TELL THAT OUR OUR STAFF

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.274
MEMBERS DO SEEM TO SPEND A LOT

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.477
OF TIME TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:34.045
TO WHAT YOU WHAT.

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:36.381
YOU ARE FOCUSING ON THE OTHER

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:38.249
THIRD ONE HERE I WANTED TO

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:40.885
MENTION THAT I A HAVE.

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:43.821
REALIZED THAT THERE IS A NEED

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:46.290
FOR ME AND ALL OF ORGANIZATIONS

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.925
BUT IN MY MY JOB ONE THING I

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.293
WOULD LIKE TO DO.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.063
IS SPEND TIME THIS YEAR TAKING A

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.499

THE COST OF THAT SHOULD BE NOT

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.845
COUNTED AGAINST OUR LEGISLATIVE

FROM ME AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.030
I THINK US OUR MONEY JUST

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.765
STEPPED OUT ALSO --

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.066
THE SHARES WITH ME HAS SHARED

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.901
<u>ITH THIS IS WELLS WHEN WE LOOK</u>

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.337
AT A BUDGET ISSUES OR FINANCIAL

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:27.838
ISSUES WHETHER THINGS THAT WE

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.306
WANT TO LOOK AT IS.

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:32.643
OFTENTIMES THERE'S TRADE OFFS

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.310
RIGHT AND SO.

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:34.145
A PROGRAM WOULD BE BROUGHT

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.246
BEFORE US AND FINANCE WILL SAY

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:37.048
WILL COST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.215
MONEY BECAUSE THE ALL BOB

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.350
CERTAIN ABOUT STAFF AND SO FORTH

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.118
BUT THERE IS RESEARCH DATA

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.920
WILLING TO SET A VERY HIGH BAR

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.355
FOR THAT IT'S NOT JUST A QUITE

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:44.922
THINK IT'S GOING TO BUT IF.

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.558
YOU HAVE EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:47.892
CLASS -- YOU

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.694
KNOW OF STUDIES --

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.027
SPECIALLY --

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.363
EVEN CLINICAL TRIALS ARE THIS

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.098
INTERVENTION WOULD ACTUALLY DO

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.900
SO EXPENDITURES LATER ON THAT

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:58.269
THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN OUR

00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:00.037
ANALYSIS AND I BASICALLY BRING

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.539
THIS UP FOR L. A. L. BECAUSE

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.040
FINANCE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNOR

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.375
SO THAT'S THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:08.212
TO GIVE DIRECTION BUT AS OUR LA

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.246
YELLOW.

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:11.082
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT KIND OF

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.183
CAPACITY IN THE LA --

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:13.484
SO AND AND FRANKLY I TELL THE

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.585
ADVOCATES WILL BRING THE

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:16.754
EVIDENCE TO THE ALEJO RIGHT SO

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.055
MY REALIZE YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.156
YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT STAFFED

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.758
AND SO BRING WHAT YOU HAVE.

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.960
BUT I DO HOPE THAT THE LA --

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.229
CAN LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE.

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:25.896
IN ADDITION TO HOPEFULLY BE I'LL

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.331
DO A LITTLE OF YOUR OWN RESEARCH

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:29.400
BUT BUT AT LEAST LOOK AT AND SAY

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.869
WELL ACTUALLY IN THE OUT YEARS

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.971
WE SHOULD BE SCORING SAVINGS.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:34.805
NOT JUST COSTS RIGHT BECAUSE

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.373
EASIEST CORE LIKE OF THIS GUN

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.141
REQUIRE EX NUMBER PEOPLE AT

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.610
CETERA AND DAYS AFTER IAN THAT'S

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.512
MONEY OUT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:42.413
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS WELL

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.514
ACTUALLY PUTTING THOSE

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:45.950
INVESTMENTS AND LEAD TO SAVINGS

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.184
AND AGAIN I'M WILLING TO SET A

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:48.519
PRETTY HIGH BAR FOR THAT.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.354
EVIDENCE RIGHT BUT WHEN THEY

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.856
DOES WHAT IT DOES WE SHOULD

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:52.790
REFLECT THAT IN THE OUT YEARS

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.493
THE SAVINGS AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK.

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:56.393
TO CREATING THAT KIND OF

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.662
CAPACITY WITHIN THE LA L. TO BE

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.364
ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:03.334
WELL THE SENATOR PAN YES THIS IS --

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.469
ACTUALLY AN AREA THAT I THINK

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:05.936
WOULD.

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:09.140
FALL WITHIN. ONE OF THE FOR

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.041
POINTS THAT I BROUGHT UP AT THE

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.810
END OF MY PRESENTATION AS ONE OF

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:15.379
THE PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE WHICH

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:16.080
IS.

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:17.882
TO BUILD OUT THIS LONG RUN

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.650
OUTLOOK TO EXAMINE FUTURE FUTURE

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.286
BUDGET PRESSURES EMERGING ISSUES.

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:25.823
MY VIEW IS THAT THAT TYPE OF IF

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.358
COULD BE BUILT INTO SOMETHING

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:28.959
THAT LOOKS AT TRENDS OVER THE

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.761
LONGER TERM.

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:32.229
AND YOU COULD ENVISIONED WE HAD

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.031
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS JUST LAST

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:37.468
WEEK INTERNALLY YOU CAN ENVISION.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.403
POTENTIALLY DOING SOME KIND OF

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.806
SCENARIO ANALYSIS OF IF WE DON'T

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.707
MAKE THIS INTERVENTION IF WE DO

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.442
MAKE THIS INTERVENTION.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:47.211
AND I I DO THINK THERE'S

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:49.914
POTENTIAL TO DO THAT AND YOU

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.783
KNOW.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.653
ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER YOU KNOW

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.087
HAD A HOME.

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.722
YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES.

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.825
MONEY YOU SPEND TODAY MAY SEEM

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:01.859
LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S GOING TO

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:03.661
COST A LOT MORE IF YOU WAIT TEN

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:05.429
YEARS TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:06.931
LEAKY ROOF FOR PROBLEM THE HAVE

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:07.865
SO.

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:10.367
I MEAN I I DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:11.368
POINT AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.003
THAT WE WILL --

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.471
BE THINKING ABOUT OKAY --

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.273
I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.374
BECAUSE I THINK THAT --

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:20.211
TOO OFTEN WHEN WE LOOK AT ISSUES

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:21.679
WE SIMPLY SAY WELL THIS IS THE

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:23.314
UP FRONT COSTS AND WE NEED TO

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.349
STAFF ON THE ON GOING BASIS IS

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:26.116
THERE NOT.

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.484
BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'RE

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:28.385
INVESTING IN THAT AND AND

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:30.054
FRANKLY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.589
EVEN ON THE I. T. PROJECTS I'VE

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:32.823
CHALLENGE PEOPLE SAID OKAY FINE

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.258
WE'RE MAKING THIS INVESTMENT IT

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:35.759
OF BAY L. CREW CALL THE SERVICE

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:36.961
AT CENTER AND THIS IS NOT JUST

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:37.761
ABOUT IT BY THE WAY.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.865
BUT LIKE IS IT GOING TO MAKE US

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:44.969
MORE FISH THESE TASKS THAT IS SO

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:45.936
SO I THINK THERE'S A WIDE

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.638
VARIETY OF RANGE OF THINGS --

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:49.373
I THINK A LOT HUMAN SERVICES AND

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.108
HEALTH CARE STUFF AS WELL --

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:51.876
WESHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.410
BECAUSE I WE SAID THAT ONE AWAY

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.179
AS WE PREPARE FOR A FUTURE

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.081
DOWNTURN IS ONE WAY IS OF COURSE

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:58.549
WE PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE FOR THAT

00:41:58.616 --> 00:41:59.483
BUT THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.118
WE MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WHILE WE

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:01.852
HAVE THE FUNDS.

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.454
THAT LEAD TO THE KIND OF CHANGES

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.189
IN THE WAY WE DO THINGS.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.591
THAT THEN MAKE US MORE RESILIENT

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:08.659
THAT ALSO SEE THIS MY IN THE

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.461
FUTURE IN FACT I'D ARGUE THAT

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:11.362
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.430
PAYING FOR NOW AS A RESULT OF

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:14.565
DECISIONS SHORT TERM DECISIONS

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:15.699
ARE MADE.

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:17.034
DURING PREVIOUS DOWNTURNS THAT

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:17.668
WE'RE NOT PAYING THE PRICE FOR

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.436
NOW.

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:20.271
AS WELL AND SO --

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.972
ANDSO WE ARE SPENDING MORE NOW

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.274
THAT WE COULD IT COULD HAVE

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.575
BECAUSE PEOPLE MADE REALLY SHORT

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.510
TERM DECISIONS BACK THEN.

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:28.045

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:30.748
CHALLENGE AT THAT TIME.

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:31.682
BUT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.549
THESE THINGS THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:34.151
THEBEST POSSIBLE DECISIONS I

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.286

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.391
MANAGEMENT --

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.225
WAYS.

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.827
TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:39.263
RECORD THE QUESTIONS THAT COME

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:40.264
IN IN FACT.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.932
MR SYDNEY ONE OF THE FORMER

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:45.169
DEPUTY TO MY ATTENTION A VERY

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:48.172
GOOD IDEA OF EVEN DEVELOPING AN

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:51.074
APP WHERE YOUR TECHNOLOGY

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:53.143
ORIENTED STAFF MEMBERS COULD GO

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.645
ON AND AND SUBMIT A REQUEST AND

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.046
HOPEFULLY THEN IT WOULD BE

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:57.681
RECORDED.

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:00.450
AND AND FUNNELED TO THE YOU KNOW

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:02.119
THE PROPER SECTION SO.

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.620
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A WORK IN

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:06.323
PROGRESS I THINK BUT YOU KNOW

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.058
THAT THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.894
HOW WE DO IT THIS TIME.

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:12.262
SO I THINK  WOULD REALLY

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.830
ENCOURAGE YOU.

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:16.900
TO DEVELOP A FORMALIZED PROCESS

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.335
I THINK --

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.337
QUITE OFTEN --

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:21.805
THINGS ARE DONE INFORMALLY IN

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:23.507
THIS BUILDING.

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.409
AND I THINK IT'S TO OUR TO OUR

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:27.544
DETRIMENT SO IT REALLY NEEDS TO

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.078
BE IN MY OPINION KIND OF

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.246
PROFESSIONAL EYES --

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:31.648
I KNOW THAT THIS IS MY MY SEVEN

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:33.083
I'M SORRY MY SEVENTY YEAR HERE

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.352
THE FACT THAT I DON'T KNOW --

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:38.222
OW THAT PROCESS WORKS OR --

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:41.291
HOW HOW TO GO DO IT I THINK SAYS

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:43.193
SOMETHING AND?

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.329
WHAT I ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.297
REPORTER YOUR PC SO THAT SAYS

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.832
SOMETHING --

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:49.533
SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD JUST

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.702
BE REALLY BEHOOVE ALL OF US

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:54.104
ESPECIALLY AS NEW MEMBER

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.739
ACTUALLY IN A WAY TOO MUCH TURN

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.141
IN THIS LEGISLATURE REALLY --

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:58.909
LOOK FOR TO LITTLE MORE

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.277
STABILITY IN THAT BUT I THINK

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:01.712
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:04.548
SO -- JUST

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:08.252
JUST ANOTHER ON SORT OF JUST

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:10.254
KATAKANA COMMENTING YOU CAN FEEL

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.821
FREE.

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:12.222
TO THE COULD TO DISCUSS THE TWO

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:14.791
IS. ONE OF THE THINGS --

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:16.393
I I REALLY DID APPRECIATE

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.227
SITTING --

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.228
IN BUDGET SUB TO WHEN I WAS A

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.197
MEMBER THERE IS JUST THE

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:23.567
ANALYSIS AND THE INFORMATION

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.669
THAT WAS REALLY REALLY DEVELOPED --

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.070
ONE QUESTION THAT I DID ALWAYS

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:29.973
HAVE WAS THERE'S ALWAYS SOME

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.041
SORT OF RECOMMENDATION.

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:33.410
SOME KIND OF AT THE END AND I

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:37.347
THINK ON RATHER THAN.

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:38.015
YOU KNOW NOT JUST KIND OF POSE A

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:40.317
SENSE AT THE SORT OF FOOD FOR

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:40.884
THOUGHT AS RAT RATHER THAN

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:42.819
HAVING A SORT OF FINAL

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.121
RECOMMENDATION PERCENT THINK

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:45.489
WHAT WOULD OFTEN BE HELPFUL.

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:46.690
WOULD BE IT'S SORT OF A LIST OF

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:50.360
OPTIONS ARE ABOUT IT SO I KIND

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:51.395
OF WOULD GET I WOULD READ THE

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:52.562
ANALYSIS TO GET TO THE

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.431
CONCLUSION I BE LIKE WELL HOW DO

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:54.931
THEY HOW THEY GET HERE.

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:56.300
HOW DID THEY GET TO THE END?

RECOMMENDATION OR ANSWER --

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:04.741

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:08.378
TO HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:09.579

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.515

THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENED AND

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.087
ANY SORT OF REGULARITIES I THINK

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.321

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.420
THE SOMETIMES.

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.689
THE REPORTS THAT WE PRODUCE --

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.591
THAT MIGHT BE THIS MIGHT BE ONE

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:28.658

THE DO DEVELOP A MENU OF

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:39.970
ALTERNATIVE CAN OPTIONS FOR THE

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:14.004
JUST TO KNOW WHAT'S THE BOTTOM

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.305
LINE WHAT IS LA --

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:18.275
THINKING ABOUT THIS AND IN THAT

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.510
WAY MAYBE IT COULD HELP IN THAT

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:23.513
REGARD OF I THINK UP ABSOLUTELY

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.281
NOTHING JUST THAT THE THE FINAL

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.282
POINT IS.

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:26.917
ON THE ASSIGNMENT OF WAR

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:29.219
REGARDING THE REPORTS THAT ARE

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.153
GIVEN TO MEMBERS REQUESTS ARE

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.254
PART OF THE BUDGET.

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:32.923
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.991
HAVE THAT IN SOME SOME LEVEL OF

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.726
DISCUSSION OR CONSULTATION WITH

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.061
JAIL BC --

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.863
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR OR I I KNOW

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.065
IN THE FALL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:44.534
YOU KNOW WE CAN KIND OF PROTECT

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.369
HERE ARE.

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:47.337
A HERO HERE WE JUST SEE COMING

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:48.872
YEAH FIVE ISSUES.

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.307
THAT ARE HOT LIKE IMAGES JUST

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.107
FOR EXAMPLE NOT REALLY IN THE

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:51.808
PURVIEW OF LA --

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.310
BUT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:53.910
JUST REALLY TRYING TO GRAPPLE

00:51:53.977 --> 00:51:55.412
WITH THE IS ON TOP OF THE

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:57.414
WILDFIRES IS REALLY WHAT'S GOING

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:57.714
TO HAPPEN.

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.417
REGARDING ALL THE I'LL.

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:02.385
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE UTILITIES

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:03.353
COMMITTEES ARE REALLY GRAPPLING

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.754
WITH THAT BUT FROM A BROADER.

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.324
POINT OF VIEW THAT IT IT'S NOT

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.892
ENOUGH FOR EVEN THE COMMITTEES

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.293
TO WAIT FOR A BILL.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.261
IT DID THIS IS RELEASING THAT

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.596
THAT'S MUCH BIGGER THINKING

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.231
ABOUT HOW ENERGY IS GOING TO BE

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.299
PROVIDED HOW TO PROVIDE IT

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.300
SAFELY.

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:23.406
ON HOW IT'S DONE IN LINK TO JUST

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:24.341
THAT NOT NOT JUST HIS EYES AS AN

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:25.442
EXAMPLE THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.543
OF THEM THAT WE ARE.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.045
SORT OF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.381
AND YOU KNOW REALLY THERE'S A

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.550
DOES AVOID AND THINKING AND

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:35.752
RESEARCH AND TO A POLICY

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:36.953
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THAT'S JUST

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.555
ONE OF I WOULD SAY --

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:39.556
THEREFORE FIVE THINGS I THINK

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.291
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SINGLE

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:42.993
PAYER ISSUES HAVE BEEN SORT OF

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.361
DOMINANT OF LAST COUPLE DECADES

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:45.328
BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S REALLY

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.096
BEEN.

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.965
PART OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION OF

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:51.067
LAST COUPLE YEARS AND HAS ALSO.

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:54.538
LACKED A HEY WE HEAR SOME PURE

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:55.805
SOME REALLY --

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.073
ACADEMIC OFF BEHIND IT WHICH I

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.575
THINK THE OFFICE COULD BE

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.744
EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HELPFUL WITH.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.279
SO ON THE THOSE ARE JUST A

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.547
COUPLE A COUPLE THOUGHTS TO JUST

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:05.148
SAY HEY I THINK WE WE REALLY

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.983
VALUE THE OFFICE WE REALLY WOULD

LOVE TO HELP WITH OFFICE BY

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.219
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE.

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:11.755
A LITTLE MORE OF SYNC BETWEEN

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.223

REMIND ME WHAT TIME OF YEAR --

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:20.430
BUT I KNOW I CAN'T BE THE MIDDLE

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:21.798
THE BUDGET ANALYSIS THAT THE

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.200
OFFICE TYPICALLY DOES THESE KIND

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.602
OF FORWARD THINKING.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:27.337
DOCUMENTS THEY TEND TO BE

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.705
RELEASED --

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.808
MORE IN THE POST BUDGET PERIOD

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.511
MMHM YOU KNOW MAYBE JULY THROUGH --

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.446
OCTOBER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET TO

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:38.715
NOVEMBER AND THAT'S WHEN THE

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.350
FORECAST IS COMING OUT RIGHT

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.519
THERE'S ACTUALLY A SMALL WINDOW.

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:43.353
ALTHOUGH.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.023
OF COURSE THAT GOES INTO THOSE

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.458
REPORTS HAS STARTED WELL BEFORE

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:50.527
THAT SOMETIMES IT EVEN TAKES

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.394
MORE THAN A YEAR.

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.763
SO THAT'S THE PHASE WHERE I I

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.165
THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:58.201
US TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH JAIL

00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:00.537
BC MEMBERS AND AND OTHERS TO

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.772
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME.

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:05.308
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT EVER

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.344
SURPRISED OR CUT OFF FLAT FOOTED

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.845
BY WHAT WE PRODUCE AND SO I

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.246
ASKED THAT JUST BECAUSE OF THAT

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.115
I THINK WE SHOULD COMMIT COMMIT

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.350
AS JAIL B. C. THAN TO CONVENE

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.418
ANOTHER HEARING TO GO DEEPER

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:16.052
INTO THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.420
IF YOU.

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:18.388
POLL EVERY MEMBER THE D. L. B.

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.190
C. YOU WILL GET A VERY DIFFERENT

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:22.258
LIST I'M SURE SO IF WE COULD

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.259
CONVENE AS A G. L. B. C. TO HAVE

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:24.928
THAT SPECIFIC CONVERSATION.

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:26.596
I THINK THAT'S ONLY FAIR TO YOU

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:28.365
AND HELPFUL TO US WE SHOULD

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:32.135
FOLLOW UP ON THAT --

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.604
WITH REGARD TO THE REQUESTS I

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.072
THINK THAT IS A GREAT IDEA TO

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:37.974
FORMALIZE THE PROCESS.

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.810
IN THE MEAN TIME --

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:44.147
HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE TO OUR

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.382
STAFF BECAUSE THE REQUEST COME

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:47.183
FROM THE STAFF AND MAKING SURE

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.351
THAT STAFF?

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:51.021
KNOW WHO TO DIRECT THE REQUEST

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:53.056
TO IS IT A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.824
INTO THE ALEJO OR DO THEY SEND

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.559
THE EMAIL TO THE ANALYSTS THEY

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:58.094
KNOW WHO DOES THE WORK IN THAT

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:58.294
AREA.

00:54:58.361 --> 00:54:59.729
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT AS

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.731
YOU DO YOUR VISITS WITH MEMBERS

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:02.599

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:04.734
MEMBER.

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.804
UNDERSTANDS WHO TO ASK WHAT OF

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.739
AND THE MEMBER STAFF ARE CLEAR

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.574
ABOUT WHO TO DIRECT QUESTIONS TO

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.777
IT MIGHT BE.

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:15.345
KIND OF THAT FOUNDATIONAL AND

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:17.681

OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:23.153
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE'S

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:24.120
NOTHING CURRENTLY THAT WOULD

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:26.122

NOT PUT IT ON AGAIN --

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:29.145
ANYWAY -- I

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.648
I HAD A BIT OF A REPUTATION

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.383
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS THE CHAIR OF

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:34.751
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE A

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:36.853
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.822
I DID NOT CALL ON THE LA --

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:41.324
AS FREQUENTLY AS PREVIOUS

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.459
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRS HAD.

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:45.895
AND I WANT TO DO IS CONVEY SOME

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.197
OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ALREADY

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.299
EXPRESSED --

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:51.868
REFLECT WHY I DID NOT DO SO.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:54.137
I VERY MUCH VALUE THE ANALYSIS

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:54.971
THAT THE LA --

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:57.774
PROVIDES US BUT WHAT I IN THOSE

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:01.411
CONTEXTS WHAT I WANT.

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:04.514
IS ANALYSIS NOW THAT ISN'T THAT

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:06.149
DOES NOT MEAN THAT.

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:09.252
THE OPINION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE.

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:13.056
ANALYZED THOSE THINGS THAT ARE

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:13.790
NOT LEGITIMATE FOR US TO

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:14.991
CONSIDER.

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.626
BUT WHEN THIS WHEN THE ISSUE

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.928
BEFORE US HASN'T REALLY BEEN

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.496
ANALYZED.

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:24.334
THEN MY ISSUE WAS I'M NOT BEING

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.369
PROVIDED NECESSARILY IMPARTIAL

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:29.839
DATA OR SOMETHING TO WAY I'M

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.007
BEING GIVEN --

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.110
AN OPINION AND AGAIN THAT SOME

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.478
PEOPLE MAY SAY WELL LA --

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:36.246
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS AN

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:39.382
OPINION BUT I WANT THAT BACKED

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:40.316
BY.

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:42.619
THAT ANALYSIS AND THERE WERE IT

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:45.355
WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THAT YEAR

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:47.390
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT THERE

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:48.091
WAS.

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:52.362
A NUMBER OF SUBJECT AREAS WHERE.

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:52.996
ELLIE --

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:55.131
STAFF WOULD OPINE AND I WOULD

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:58.301
ASK IS THAT BASED ON EIGHT YOU

00:58:58.368 --> 00:58:59.669
KNOW SOME RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.504
OR SOME DATA THAT YOU HAVE FOR

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:02.939
US OR I WOULD ASK VARIOUS

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.674
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.910
AND IT WOULD NOT BE.

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:09.012
AND SO THAT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:11.814
ME BECAUSE IT WAS I WOULD I FELT

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.850
I WAS GETTING LESS.

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:17.086
OF THE OF WHAT THE ROLE OF THE

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.821
LA -- REALLY.

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.056
IS FOR US.

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.457
NOW OF COURSE WEIGHING THE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:24.494
NUMBER ALL HAS COMPARED TO

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.464
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I MEAN SHE

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:32.368

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:35.038
THAT OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS.

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:36.673
LOOKED AT THAT IN HIGHLIGHTED IT

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.174
AS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:41.210
LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:42.412
US AND I WILL SPEAK NOW FOR

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:44.447
MYSELF.

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:47.951
I REALLY VALUE THAT ANALYSIS AND

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:51.854
WE NEED IT --

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:52.622

I MEAN OBVIOUSLY LET'S GIVE AN

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.874

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:24.454
TWENTY SEVENTEEN I DON'T THINK

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.521
THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:26.556
AWAITING YET.

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:31.227
BUT CLEARLY CALIFORNIA BOTH I'M

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.396
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION BUDGETARY

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.331
DIRECTION AND THE VOTERS.

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.367
HAS IS MADE IT A PRIORITY THAT

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.402
WE WANT TO THAT NOT ONLY WE WANT

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.437
TO PROVIDE QUALITY RE UP BUT WE

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:42.605
HAVE --

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.308
DESIGNED THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN THE

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.543
ABILITY FOR A PERSON TO GET

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.412
BEFORE PRO BOARD BASED ON IT SO

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.781
CLEARLY IT IS IN AN AREA THAT'S

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:54.250
VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US --

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.418
BUT WHAT WOULD I THINK BE

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.187
HELPFUL IS WHEN.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.289
WHEN A DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.091
THE L. LIKE THE AUDITOR DOES

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.726
SUCH REPORT?

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.028
IF THE LA --

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.430
GIVEN THEIR EXPERTISE.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.297
CAN.

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.400
TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:12.335
CORPORATE IT WITH WHAT LA --

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:13.703
KNOWS IN THE ANALYSIS LA ALWAYS

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.272
DONE SO THAT WE HAVE.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.075
A BETTER PICTURE AS WE PROCEED

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.877
WITH HOW WE WANT AS WE FIGURE

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.745
OUT HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED SO

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.048
IT'S NOT JUST KIND OF LIKE ANY

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:26.649
MEANING MIND YOU MùT WHICH YOU

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.518
KNOW WHICH OF THESE.

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.954
ARE WE WHATEVER DO WE EITHER

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.690
THINK IS VALID OR AND I THOUGHT

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:37.460
THAT IF WE TAKE THE THERE WAS

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.095
SOME VERY GOOD INFORMATION IN

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.597
THERE BUT ALSO FELT IT DID NOT.

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:44.300
INCOME IS THE BIG PICTURE.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.736
OF WHAT IT WAS LEGITIMATELY

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:50.440
LOOKING AT CERTAIN --

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:53.443
THE SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS IN IN

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:56.712
CDC ARE OF NOT PROPERLY TRACKING

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.247
WHO IS IN THE PROGRAM'S.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.382
NOT --

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.350
PROVIDING THEM EQUALLY ACROSS

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:05.254
YARDS AND NOT A NECESSARILY --

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.056
SKY SCHEDULING OUR LISTING THE

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.092
INMATE'S APPROPRIATELY GIVEN OUR

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.526
OTHER POLICIES.

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.428
BUT IT THERE WERE SOME BIGGER

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:13.496
PICTURE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.431
MISSING AND THINGS THAT THE LA --

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:18.434
HAS STUDIED IN OPINED ON SO

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.469
HAVING THE LA --

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.137
COME BACK TO US BEFORE E JUST

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.272
ACT ON THE AUDITOR'S REPORT

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.774
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL NOW I WANT

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.175
TO LIE DETAIL THERE BUT I CAN.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:29.045
I CAN GIVE LOTS MORE EXAMPLES

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.781
THE DMV IS ANOTHER ONE DMV IS

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.082
GUNS I MEAN THE LA ALWAYS DONE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.951
VERY BRIEF JUST LIKE HAND OUT ON

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.253
OUR DMV ISSUES THE AUDITOR NOW

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.454
IS DONE A WHOLE LOT IT.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.656
WE'VE GOT THE GOVERNOR'S TO TO

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.158
PUT MONEY AND YOU KNOW BUT IT'S

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.759
LIKE KATE CAN WE TAKE THE

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:46.362
VARIOUS EXPERTISE WE HAVE.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.365
AND RY TO SYNCHRONIZE IT SOME

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.000
SO THAT WE ARE BEING GIVEN.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.069
THAT OPTIMAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.537
AGAIN KNOWING WITH ONE S. WE

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.506
DON'T ALWAYS RESPOND BUT AT

01:02:56.572 --> 01:03:02.311
LEAST WOULD BE HELPFUL --

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.881
THEN -- ALL

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.349
AT THE ELLIE OWES SUBJECT MATTER

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.483
REPORTS SAY IN THE LAST THREE

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.552
YEARS THEY LEGITIMATELY COVERED

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.120
THINGS THAT.

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:12.421
ARE YOU KNOW ON ARM THAT HAVE

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.390
BEEN VERY PRESSING OR THAT ARE

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.926
CONSISTENTLY THINGS THAT WE

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.628
SHOULD FOLLOW PAY ATTENTION TO

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.762
BUDGETARY LEE.

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:20.796
SO THEY'VE BEEN IN THE AREA OF

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.632
FIRE RECOVERY FIRE RESPONSE

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:25.168
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DISASTER.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:27.003
OBVIOUSLY LEGITIMATE GIVEN THE

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.671
LAST FEW YEARS WHETHER IT'S

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.139
FLOODS FIRES YOU NAME IT.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.475
ALSO MEDI CAL AND OTHER HEALTH

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.443
PROGRAMS CHILD CARE BECAUSE

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.245
THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT THE

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.848
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INCREASING

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.816
FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.785
AND IS AND THE GOVERNOR NOW HE'S

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:43.686
ALSO GOT A GREAT.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.155
INTEREST IN ADVANCING SO THERE'S

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:46.789
MANY MANY REPORT YOU'VE DONE IN

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:49.792
THAT SUBJECT AREA IN HOUSING.

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.762
BUT THEN WHEN I THINK ABOUT.

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:53.930
SO THOSE ARE ALL.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.932
LEGITIMATE AND FOLLOW THINGS

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.134
THAT WE ARE EITHER ENGAGED IN

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.635
GREATLY OR SHOULD BE BUT THEN

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:02.071
WHEN I STEP BACK AND I THINK

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.506
ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:04.907
THAT POTENTIALLY.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.442
WE SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THAT

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.945
HAVEN'T BEEN WAITIN AND THE

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.646
ASSEMBLY BUDGET YOUR MENTION THE

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:11.480
I. O. U.'S.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:15.351
A COUPLE OF OTHERS --

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:20.423
BUT OUR CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:21.991
THE FIRST STATE TO BELIEVE WE

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.659
WERE THE FIRST TO SET INCREDIBLY

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:26.229
AMBITIOUS WASTE REDUCTION GOALS.

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.097
AND RECYCLING GOALS.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:28.698
AND WE DON'T A PRETTY GOOD JOB

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.900
OF IT.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.568
BUT WE HAVE NOT WE AND LOCAL

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.869
GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT REALLY

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.371
LOOKED CLOSELY AS TO WHETHER

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.006
WERE IN FACT REDUCING WASTE NOW.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.808
AND THERE'S BEEN A TOTAL CRISIS

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:41.310
WE DEPEND ON WE CALIFORNIA ON

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.413
SENDING THE MATERIALS SOMEWHERE

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:44.747
ELSE.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.882
JOINT INDONESIA WHEREVER AND

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:47.750
HOPING THAT THEY'LL DO SOMETHING

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.452
WITH THEM THOSE MARKETS HAVE

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.287
MORE LESS COLLAPSED.

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.990
SO WHAT WHICH NOW IT IT'S NOT

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.057
CLEAR TO ME THAT WE REALLY HAVE

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:58.027
WASTE REDUCTION MUCH AT ALL.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.929
AND THAT'S GONNA BE LOOMING

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.297
GREATER AND GREATER PROBLEM AND

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.566
YET OUR FOR OUR WHOLE FOUNDATION

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.335
OF OUR POLICIES ARE ASTE

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.271
POLICIES ARE CLIMATE PROTECTION

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.373
PAUL ARE ALL BASED ON THAT WHICH

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:13.376
IS COULD BE BRIGHT NOW MYTHICAL.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:13.943
SO.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.012
IT YOU KNOW SOME LOOK AT THAT

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.413
FROM A BIG PICTURE I THINK WOULD

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.248
BE VERY HELPFUL THE OTHER THING

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.383
IS.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:24.687
REVENUE SOURCES THE LA --

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.555
AS TOO MANY OTHERS ABOUT THE

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.457
VOLATILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.526
DEPENDENCE ON PERSONAL INCOME

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.361
TAX.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:36.832
BUT IT WHAT I'VE SEEN LESS OF IS.

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.869
THAT BIG PICTURE WHAT ARE THE

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:42.438
REVENUE SOURCES THAT HAVE

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:44.140
DROPPED WHAT ARE THE REVENUE

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.242
SOURCES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.412
BEEN STABLE BUT THAT WE PRETEND

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.380
TO WE ARE NOT --

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.415
IF --

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.250
PROPERLY ADVANTAGES.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.018
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SALES

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.554
TAX NOW THAT WE HAVE FAR LESS

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.356
BRICK AND MORTAR.

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.625
OPERATE TAX FOR EXAMPLE IS I'VE

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.959
STARTED TO LOOK AT SOME RESEARCH

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.995
AND IT IS THAT AS A PORTION OF

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.430
OUR GENERAL FUND.

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:08.998
OTHER THAN ONE LITTLE BLIP

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.900
YOU'RE IN THE RECESSION IT IS

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:13.703
THE LOWEST PORTION OF OUR

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:14.337
GENERAL FUND IT IS EVER BEEN IN

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.905
HISTORY.

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:18.441
AND YET CORPORATIONS NOW ARE

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.342
WEALTHIER THAN THEY HAVE EVER

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.176
BEEN.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.044
AND RECEIVED THE BIGGEST TAX

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.347
WINDFALL FROM THE FEDS.

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:26.315
AND YOUR CALIFORNIA'S OF A

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:28.818
COLLECTING VERY LITTLE.

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.252
AND IS THAT A SUSTAINABLE OR

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.389
STABLE WAY FOR US TO HAVE OUR

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.424
TAX STRUCTURE.

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:38.427
AND THEN FINALLY ANOTHER ONE

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:38.961
THAT -- AND

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.163
I KNOW THAT THIS SESSION IS NOT

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.198
REALLY FOR US TO DO WITH OUR

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.500
PERSONAL BUT I'M TRYING.

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.634
TO THINK ABOUT THOSE OVERVIEW IS.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.404
GREAT IS THOSE.

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:49.972
AREAS OF OUR BUDGET.

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:51.407
THAT HAVE GROWN CLEARLY

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:54.076
EDUCATION LEGITIMATE LEAD THE

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.611
DEMAND THE NEGROES.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.847
BUT THOSE AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.383
BE PAYING ATTENTION.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:01.650
THAT THE STATE DID THEIR GROWING

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.285
ONE PERHAPS ONE COULD CALL STATE

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.720
ALL SAY DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.622
SOMEBODY ELSE MAYBE SHOULDN'T

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:07.923
PUT ST THE SAME.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.960
VALUE JUDGMENT ON IT BUT RATHER.

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.661
WHAT IS SO LET'S ALL GIVE THE

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.463
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ONE FOR EXAMPLE

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.965
WE HAVE --

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:19.635
POPULATION DOWN WE HAVE DONE

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.269
REAL WHAT WE'VE DONE ALL THESE

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.303
THINGS.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.872
AND YET.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.807
ARE NOT YET WE KNOW SOME OF THE

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.242
REASONS WHY.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.710
BUT IF IF.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.345
THE NUMBERS WERE TO CONTINUE TO

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.280
GROW AS THEY HAVE SAY IN THE

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.649
LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.218
WHAT WE COULD GET TO A SITUATION

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.754
WHERE CORRECTIONS WAS? 30% OF

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:39.855
OUR GF MAYBE THAT'S AN

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.824
EXAGGERATION BUT IN IS THAT

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.259
REALLY THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:43.759
GO IN.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.294
AND SO I BRING IT UP BECAUSE

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.363
VERY OFTEN. FOR MYSELF AS CHAIR

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.332
OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE THE

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.368
ANALYSIS OF EACH LITTLE

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.769
INDEPENDENT BUDGET REQUEST WHICH

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.070
IS A TEENY THING.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.239
VERSUS ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS OVER

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.275
THIS BIG PICTURE WHAT SHOULD WE

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.644
BE DOING SO THAT WE CAN OVER

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:02.545
TIME.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.413
YOU KNOW GET GET THESE THINGS

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.881
UNDER CONTROL SO THOSE ARE THE

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.416
ISSUES THAT ARE ON MY MIND AND I

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:09.051
APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.053
AND THANK YOU.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.789
YOU THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE.

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:16.859
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TWO

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.493
THINGS ARE ONE OF THE NEW

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.395
BRIEFLY HERE ONE IS TO AMPLIFY

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.629
SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST HEARD

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:23.299
FROM SOMEONE TING AND FROM-SENATOR SKINNER.

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.367
ABOUT THE A WILDFIRE LIABILITY

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.735
ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.404
REALLY MISSED OPPORTUNITY BY THE

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.206
LA -- LAST

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.875
YEAR NOT TO WEIGH IN ON THAT AND

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.410
YOU KNOW NOT AT A A GROUND LEVEL

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.878
WAY BUT IF THE THIRTY THOUSAND

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.146
FOOT VIEW.

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:38.447
OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES OF

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.115
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHAT ARE

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:41.250
THE CONSEQUENCES OF TOUCH AND

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:42.384
THAT ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.686
LETTING THAT LIABILITY FLOW

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.187
THROUGH THE UTILITIES WHAT ARE

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.822
THE IMPACTS ON P. G.'S

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.190
BANKRUPTCY.

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:49.758
ON TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS IN

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:52.394
THE STATE AND IF SB NINE A ONE

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.729
WAS EXPANDED WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.197
IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS AND

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.966
TAXPAYERS ON PASSING THAT

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.400
LIABILITY.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:08:59.168
ON TO THEM IN SECURITIZED AHEAD

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.402
SO -- IF IF

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.271
YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF I THINK

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:03.506
SOMETHING A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.340
ONLY -- DID

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:07.076
THAT REALLY WELL A COUPLE OF

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.012
YEARS AGO REALLY GOOD HAD

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.380
INFORMATION THAT WE DID NOT HAVE

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.415
ACCESS TO ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.216
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.150
THE LA --

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.319
TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THAT

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.287
TOPIC THIS YEAR BECAUSE AS YOU

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.088
KNOW.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:19.922
OUR GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:20.823
THAT'S A TOP PRIORITY FOR HIS

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.691
ADMINISTRATION IT'S CLEAR THAT

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:23.292
WE NEED TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.461
THAT -- IN

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:26.095
ANOTHER.

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.763
ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.198
I KNOW A LOT OF US.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.299
ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAVE

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.301
BEEN WATCHING WITH A LITTLE BIT

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.836
OF ALARM AT BUT STATE REVENUES

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:34.703
HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE LAST

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.473
COUPLE OF MONTHS AND IN DECEMBER

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.641
I SAW.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.109
THE THE COLLECTIONS COME IN

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.443
UNDER PROJECTIONS AND I KNOW

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.711
THAT THERE WAS SPECULATION ABOUT

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.714
THAT WAS RELATED TO THE DECLINE

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:46.348
IN THE STOCK MARKET --

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:47.316
WAS -- TO IN

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:48.183
RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN FEDERAL

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.119
TAX LAW BUT THEN IN THE MONTHS

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:51.020
THAT HAVE --

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.588
PASSED SINCE THEN WE HAVE STE

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.523
STILL CONTINUE TO COME IN UNDER

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.325
PROJECTION AND SO --

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.893
I KNOW THAT THE CRITICAL MONTH

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.563
IS GOING TO BE NEXT MONTH THAT

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:02.064
WAS A TROUBLING OR WHETHER OR

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.065
NOT THERE WAS A TREND IN A

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:06.335
HARBINGER OF THINGS TO COME --

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.237
WHAT OUR CURRENT --

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.606
IT ASSESSMENT OF THAT IS THAT

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:13.275
SOME OF IT COULD WELL BE MADE UP

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:16.478
IN APRIL FROM THE FOR AS A

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.580
RESULT OF THE TIME IN A FAX.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:20.349
HOWEVER I DO THINK AS WE MOVE

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.450
TOWARD -- A

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.786
SECOND FORECAST THAT WE DO EACH

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.955
YEAR IN MAY THAT ROUGH TIME TO

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:28.424
COME OUT ROUGHLY WITH THE

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.992
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION --

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.361
I WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.297
FORECAST IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:36.298
SOME SO.

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.567
I'M NOT REALLY IN A POSITION.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:40.402
TO FULLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AT

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.405
THIS TIME BUT AND YOU KNOW IN IN

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.307
ALL THE OPENNESS  THINK.

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.775
I THINK WE WON'T BE SURPRISED IF

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:49.178
THERE'S SOME DOWNWARD REVISION

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.013
TO THE FORECAST AT THAT TIME.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.015
THANKS I'M SURE WE'LL BE TALKING

01:10:53.082 --> 01:11:00.289
MORE ABOUT THIS YEAH.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.591
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.593
WELCOME SYSTEMATIC WOULD LEAD TO

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.160
HAVE YOU ON BOARD THANK YOU

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.462
SENATOR.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.864
MONDAY AT THE PHENOMENA ZICH THE

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:09.465
NEXT AND AROUND HERE FOR SOME

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.299
TIME [inaudible]

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:12.134
AND MIGHT SAY IT'S A PRODUCT OF

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.370
TERM LIMITS.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:17.172
MAY BE PART OF THE SOCIETAL.

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.440
BUT IT'S WHAT I CALL KIND OF

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:20.676
LACK OF VISION.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.911
AND ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY A LACK

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:24.013
OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY ABOUT

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:26.482
THE HISTORY.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:29.284
SO WE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT SOME

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.654
ISSUE OR SOME LEGISLATION.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.155
IT'S LIKE THE LIGHT BULB JUST

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.624
WENT OFF AND HERE WE GO.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:36.825
BUT WE DON'T THINK WE'LL HOW DID

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.627
THAT EVOLVE TO THIS POINT AND

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.195
WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRIED BEFORE.

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.463
THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN OTHER

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.365
WORDS.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.401
THAT TURNED HIS IMPAIRED US I

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.736
BELIEVE ALSO FROM MAKING

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.538
DECISIONS ABOUT PROJECTION.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.974
OF THE FUTURE WHAT WILL THIS

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.208
MEAN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:56.478
DOWN THE WHITE.

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.614
I REMEMBER ASKING HAVE OF SOME

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.115
OF US MEETING IN A GOVERNOR

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.650
SCHWARZENEGGER'S OFFICE ON A NEW

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.752
WATER PLAN WAY BACK IN TWO

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.254
THOUSAND AND NINE WHAT WILL THIS

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.588
MEAN FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.656
AND A BLANK LOOKS AROUND THE

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.391
ROOM TOLD ME ALL I NEEDED NO

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.694
THAT WASN'T ON ANYBODY'S MIND.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.494
THAT INVESTMENT IN

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:15.531
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN AFTER THAT

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:19.968
TO THE POINT THEM --

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:20.669
THE THE LA --

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.805
DOES A VERY FINE JOB AND I'M NOT

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.873
CRITICIZING I'M JUST SUGGESTING

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.508
TO KEEP FOCUSED.

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.143
ON SOME OF THE HISTORIC

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.479
DEVELOPMENTS THAT BROUGHT US TO

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.613
THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHEN YOU'RE

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.849
ANALYZING WHATEVER IT IS THE

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.117
TRAVEL ISING.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.019
IN ADDITION TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.620
TO US IN PROJECTING WHAT ARE THE

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:41.290
EVENTUALITIES IN THE FUTURE THAT

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.257
WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:44.293
FROM THIS.

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.961
CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.329
FRAGILITY OF OUR BUDGET

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:49.865
BALANCING AND A LOT OF THINGS

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:50.666
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.634
ACCOUNTED FOR AS WE MAKE

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:54.169
DECISIONS MOVING AHEAD

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:54.470
[inaudible]

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.605
IN ADDITION.

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.440
THE SENATE HAS PARTICULAR BEEN

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.342
CONCERNED WITH OVERSIGHT FOR A

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:01.343
FEW YEARS.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.412
NOW THAT MEANS THE OVERSIGHT IS

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.613
GONE A LITTLE BIT BEYOND JUST

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.249
POLICY COMMITTEES IN THE BUDGET

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.417
COMMITTEE IN THE BUDGET ITSELF.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.886
OF DOING SOME VERY SPECIAL

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:13.355
LOOKING AT THEWITH THE

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.591
OVERSIGHT OF AGENCIES.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.025
IT WOULD WELCOME YOUR HELP IN IN

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.360
THAT AS WELL.

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.330
WE HAVE SOME TROUBLE AGENCIES

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.165
THE DMV BE IN ONE THE OFFICE OF

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.001
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND IT

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.003
HAD MANY DIFFERENT NAMES AS I

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.304
THINK THE MOST RECENT IS DO WHAT

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.973
DEPARTMENT OF VINTAGE

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.341
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'VE

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.610
OF SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.111
DOLLARS.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.179
THOSE KINDS OF PHENOMENA IN OUR

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.114
BUDGET IF YOU COULD HELP US

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.349
ANTICIPATE.

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:41.483
LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.284
[inaudible]

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:44.253
OF THAT.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.121
AS YOUR LAN THAT VITAL SAY

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:49.191
RESTRUCTURING BUT PRIORITIZING

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.493
OR DEPLOYING YOUR RATHER LIMITED

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.463
RESOURCES.

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:55.631
THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:56.398
[inaudible]

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.566
AND FUTURE.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:58.901
EVENTUALITIES WOULD BE VERY

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:02.771
HELPFUL TO US.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.373
THANK YOU SENATOR --

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:07.009
YET WE I THINK --

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:09.311
I CAN I TAKE YOUR POINT I THINK

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.380
WE DO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:14.016
FOCUSED ON FISCAL AND BUDGET

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.617
RELATED MATTERS.

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.886
AND WE PROBABLY HAVE LESS --

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:21.423
RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO DOING --

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.458
PROGRAM REVIEWS POLICY AND

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.661
ANALYSIS DEPARTMENTAL REVIEWS

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.262
AND I THINK --

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.064
THAT SOMETHING WE WILL BE

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.465
DISCUSSING --

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:33.335
GOING FORWARD AND I MEAN FOR THE

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:36.338
RECORD WE WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE%

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:39.141
ON THE PROPOSAL FROM --

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.311
ASSEMBLYMEMBER OBERNOLTE BUT YOU

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.546
KNOW IT IF ANYBODY WERE TO ASK I

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.114
THINK YOU KNOW FOR OUR OFFICE

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.350
DID HAVE MORE RESOURCES.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.118
AND THOSE WOULD BE IF YOU ASK ME

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:51.587
THOSE WOULD BE SOME OF THE AREAS

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.689
THAT I THINK WE WOULD EXPLORE.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.891
IN MORE DETAIL.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.092
AND BE GREAT WELL THE THE

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.393
CHARGES DILUTED TO SOMETHING A A

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.362
MOMENT AGO THAT.

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.730
I CERTAINLY WAS ENTERTAINING AND

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.500
AND BECAUSE MAYBE THE

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:05.767
SUBCOMMITTEE OF THIS THAT STAFF

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.069
OF SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:09.137
ENQUIRING IF OUR BUDGET SUB

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:10.672
COMMITTEES OF CERTAIN ISSUES

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.241
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.576
AND THEN AS A THE SUBCOMMITTEE

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.945
STAFF WILL PREPARE THE MEMBERS.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:17.846
THAT WOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO US

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:18.447
[inaudible]

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:27.289
THANK YOU. FOR THE MEMBER WEBER.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.358
THE WELCOME IN A AND WE LOOK

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.092
FORWARD TO OBVIOUSLY HAVING A

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:30.826
VERY --

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:33.795
PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.397
IN YOUR OFFICE --

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:36.698
I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY REALIZE

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:38.100
THAT IN THE IN THE BUDGET

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.935
PROCESS ALL OF US HAVE CERTAIN

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.336
LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.305
IN MUCH OF IT REVOLVES AROUND

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.040
THE FACT THAT --

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:47.075
WE HAVE LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:47.910
NOT --

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.311
APPROPRIATELY HANDLE IN

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.013
CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S DEALING

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:52.981
WITH THE HOMELESS OR DEALING

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.183
WITH THE POP ISSUE POVERTY.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.419
OR EDUCATION AND THE DIRECTION

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:58.153
WE'RE GOING IN THOSE KINDS OF

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.022
THINGS AND AND PROBABLY IF YOU

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.857
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER WE WOULD

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.125
PROBABLY ALSO KIND OF THE BE

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:05.627
ALIGNED IN TERMS OF THE THINGS

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.328
WE THINK THAT ARE REALLY

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.296
IMPORTANT --

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:09.431
YET THE RESOURCES DO NOT ALLOW

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:12.467
US TO ROUTE TO BASICALLY --

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:14.937
OF BASICALLY RESPOND TO OUR

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:15.904
PRIORITIES YOU KNOW OFTEN PEOPLE

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.306
SAY THE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:18.941
OF YOUR PRIORITIES.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.609
AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE AND

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.444
PROBABLY ARE BUDGET WOULD

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.079
REFLECT OUR FRUSTRATION MUCH

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:24.646
MORE THAN ANY ANY KIND OF

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.948
PRIORITIES.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.282
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME STE A

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.351
NUMBER OF DEEP IN AND SERIOUS

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.519
ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:31.386
AND YET --

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:34.122
WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.959
ADEQUATELY GET TO THE UP TO THE

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.427
BOTTOM OF IT AND THEN GIVE US

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:40.128
DIRECTION AS TO HOW WE GET GET

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:42.197
BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.799
DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF FUNDING.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.500
OUR EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS --

01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:47.069
HOW DO WE GET TO THE ISSUE OF

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.136
DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:50.305
POVERTY OR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.540
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:52.574
REALLY BREAKING THE BACK OF

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:53.342
CALIFORNIA?

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.310
WITH ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.245
DO WE STILL ARE STANDING IN THE

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.181
SHADOW OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.349
ISSUES AND CONCERNS.

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.250
THAT GET TO THE BASIC ISSUE OF

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.353
HIM OUR OF OUR HUMANITY AND OUR

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.687
RELATIONSHIP WITH OF THE SOUL.

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.155
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOUR OFFICE

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:09.024
IS CAPABLE OF DOING IT BUT BUT I

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.192
THINK IF YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.560
ALL TRYING TO DO THOSE THINGS

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:13.228
THAT ARE DIFFERENT AUG GIVING

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.330
SOME DIRECTION TO US THAT WOULD

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.265
BE IMPORTANT ALL IT WOULD

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.867
PROBABLY PROVIDE MAYBE THE

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.402
IMPETUS FOR PEOPLE TO THE TO THE

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.403
STEP OUT.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.939
BEYOND THEIR PARTY AFFILIATIONS

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.741
OR FEARS OF CITIZENS OR WHATEVER

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:28.410
MAY BE BECAUSE CLEARLY --

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.678
WHATEVER WE'RE DOING WE TALK

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.246
ABOUT ALL TIME TENS OF OUR TAX

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.981
BASE REVENUE --

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.416
EVERYBODY SAYS IS NOT RIGHT NO

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.550
ONE WANTS TO TAKE IT ON NO ONE

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.452
WANTS TO TELL US HOW TO CORRECT

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:37.819
IT.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.421
WELL THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.289
IN ORDER TO TO RIGHT THE SHIP

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:43.792
ALSO IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:47.596
WE TRIED --

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:48.463
WHEN I WAS HERE THE BUDGET FOR

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.399
WHAT --

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:52.134
STARTED THE PROCESS OF ZERO

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.635
BASED BUDGETING AND WE DID IT

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:54.136
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.203
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.805
THE GOAL WAS TO DO THAT EVERY

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.141
YEAR WITH A DIFFERENT PORTION OF

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.309
THE BUDGET AND IT JUST KIND OF

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.311
DIED DIDN'T GO VERY FAR --

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:05.313
BUT BECAUSE AS LONG AS YOU

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.314
CONTINUE TO FUND THE THINGS

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.549
YOU'VE ALWAYS FUNDED.

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:08.550
YOU ALWAYS GET THE RESULTS

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.385
YOU'VE ALREADY ALWAYS GOTTEN AND

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:11.686
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CHALLENGE

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.422
IS HOW DO WE GET BEYOND THAT HOW

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:14.923
WE LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY OR THE

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.259
INEFFICIENCY OF MANY AGENCIES.

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.727
AND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS IN

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.162
A DIFFERENT WAY IF WE DON'T END

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:22.264
UP INCREASING REVENUES WE

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.498
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:25.100
WE'RE DOING WITH THE REVENUES WE

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:25.300
HAVE.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.468
AND WHAT THE NOT THAT'S THE MOST

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.437
EFFECTIVE USE OF IT GIVEN THE

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:30.205
VALUES THAT WE HAVE BUT WE BEGIN

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:32.040
THAT PROCESS IN THERE WERE SOME

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.141
CHANGES MADE TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.576
OF CALIFORNIA TERMS OF THE

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:36.278
FUNDING OF THE PRESIDENT'S

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.446
OFFICE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.146
AND THINGS THAT WERE --

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.548
KIND OF OUT OF SYNC WITH THE

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.683
VALUES OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.919
HAVE YET TO REALLY --

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.020
BEGIN TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:48.390
WE SAID WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR SO-THAT --

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:49.825
AGENCIES OR SECTIONS OF THE

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.393
BUDGET WOULD KNOW THAT IT WAS

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.794
COMING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:54.196
IT WASN'T LIKE A WOULD BE A ONE

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.163
YEAR THING THAT THEY KNEW AND

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:55.897
THREE YEARS WE HAVE.

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.299
TO BASICALLY DO ZERO BASED

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:59.067
BUDGETING AND JUSTIFY WHAT THE

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.103
MONEY WE HAVE AND AND WHAT

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.471
WHAT'S BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN ALL

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:03.605
THIS THERE SO THAT BECOMES

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.540
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE JUST DID

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:08.110
SOMETHING WITH --

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:11.113
I GUESS THE ONE ON WE WERE

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.848
GETTING THE RESULTS YOU WANT IN

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:15.016
TERMS OF REHABILITATION --

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.251
BUT WE JIM RESPONDED THOSE

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:17.853
THINGS AFTER THE FACT RATHER

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.387
THAN BEFORE.

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.056
AND IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHERE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.924
THE MONEY IS AND HOW IT'S GOING

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:23.992
TO GO AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:24.559
TO WHAT IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:25.527
EFFECTIVE WELL WE JUST KIND OF

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.329
FUNDING THE SAME OLD THING THAT

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.064
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE SO.

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:30.465
I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.600
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE HOPEFULLY

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.168
IF YOU GET MORE STAFF TO BE ABLE

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:34.236
TO DO THAT.

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.470
BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO BEGIN

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.472
TO REALLY HONE IN ON THAT

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.474
BECAUSE THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.343
OF OF AT LEAST MY FRUSTRATION

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.277
WHEN EVEN WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.578
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ON THE

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:44.279
BUDGET.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.914
THAT WE HAVE SSI AND YOUKNOW WE

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:46.982
HAVE ALL THESE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.383
STRUGGLING WITH LITTLE OR NO

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.684
MONEY OUR SENIORS ARE NOT BEING

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:51.253
ADEQUATELY CARED.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.921
FOR AND WHEN WE DO EVERY DAY

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.089
EVERY TO EVERYTHING UP IT CAME

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.291
OUT TO BE ABOUT WHAT A DOLLAR

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:59.227
FIFTY SAID SOMETHING PER PERSON.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.395
AT WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.062
YOU KNOW FOR THE CLASS WE WOULD

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.264
JUST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.332
SO IT WAS IT WAS AN INSULT EVEN

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.834
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL.

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:07.769
OF BECAUSE OF WHAT LITTLE WE

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:10.338
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO --

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:14.543
SO I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:16.144
ACCOUNTS OF REALLY HARD

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:16.444
[inaudible]

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:20.348
AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW DO WE

THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO

PEOPLE IN JOBS WHEN IN FACT IT'S

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:42.724

I MEAN CERTAINLY THE DMV IS A

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.920
POSTER CHILD FOR HOW WE COULD

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.254
PROBABLY USE TECHNOLOGY A LOT

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:13.521
BETTER --

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:16.658

CULTURE ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN SET

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:41.810
HAVING INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:43.578

ACROSS IN THESE MEETINGS THAT

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.390
THE OFFICE.

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.525
IT THE OFFICES INDEPENDENCE IS

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.127
AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC THAT

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:01.329
THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO VALUE

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:02.997
QUITE HIGHLY.

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:04.466
AS FOR TECHNOLOGY.

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.167
WE ARE IN THE WORKING ON A

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.437
REPORT RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ONE OF

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.138
THESE.

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:12.407
TOPICS THAT I THINK WE HAVE A

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.008
UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WE

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:18.079
HAVE A CROSS CUTTING VIEWPOINT.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:18.680
ON THE STATE TECHNOLOGY IS AN

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:21.583
ISSUE THAT SEASON DIFFERENT

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.585
DEPARTMENT AND DEPARTMENTS SORT

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.420
OF LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:25.887
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.990
NECESSARILY A SINGLE FOCAL POINT

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.625
FOR THE ISSUE OF TECHNOLOGY

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:32.060
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL OF US IN

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:33.628
ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE.

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.063
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.030
OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.799
EFFICIENCIES IN THE ONE THING I

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.601
HAVE BROUGHT UP WITH OUR STAFF

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.736
MEMBER THE OTHER DAY IS THAT

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.304
THERE'S ALSO RISK.

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:45.006
WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THE RISK OF

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.875
CYBERSECURITY IN THOSE KIND OF

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.209
THREATS AND I THINK IT'S

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:49.978
IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA YOU

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:53.081

INCIDENT LIKE THAT AT THIS POINT

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.250
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.218
SHOULD BE TRYING TO THINK AHEAD

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:58.186
ABOUT AND SEE YOU.

COULD WE DO TO BE MORE PREPARED
