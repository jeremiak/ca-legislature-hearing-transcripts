SOME MEMBER KALRA THE BILL ALSO

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.335
WE THINK GREATLY CLARIFIES THE

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.102
STANDARD THAT GOVERNS WHEN

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.938
EMPLOYERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:45.872
DO HAVE.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.907
TO REPORT SERIOUS INJURIES AND

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.742

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.910
DO HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.145
WITH UNDER REPORTING THESE

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.513
INCIDENTS WHERE.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.114
BY OUR BEST ESTIMATES ONLY ABOUT

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.883
HALF OF THE EXISTING FINALITY IS

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.751
IN SERIOUS INJURIES ARE REPORTED

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.887
TO CALIFORNIA -- DESPITE THE

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.888
FACT THERE'S A FIVE THOUSAND

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.424
DOLLAR PENALTY FOR DOING SO AND

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.492
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS EXCUSE

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.759
ME THE UNDER REPORTING IS AN

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:07.727
ISSUE IS BECAUSE IT OFTEN

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.962
TRIGGERS AN INSPECTION.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.763
AND SO THAT INSPECTION IS

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.965
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO THE

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.666
CALLOUS OR CAN GET OUT THERE IN

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.735
A TIMELY FASHION -- IF NECESSARY

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.870
AND ASSESS THE HAZARD TO MAKE

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.705
SURE THAT OTHER FATALITIES AND

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.473
OTHER SERIOUS INJURIES ARE A

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.909
RISK -- AND SO WE THINK THAT

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.211
THIS CHANGE OFFERED BY EIGHTEEN

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.145
OH FIVE MAKES IT MORE CLEAR FOR

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.780
EMPLOYERS TO KNOW WHEN THEY DO

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:28.815
NEED TO REPORT THESE THINGS AS

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.816
EXISTING STANDARD OF

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.519

LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.422
STANDARD OVER THE YEARS AND

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.991
AGREE IT CAN SOMETIMES BE KIND

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.459
OF TOUGH FOR EMPLOYERS TO ASSESS

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.827
WHEN THEY ARE SUPPORTS TO REPORT

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.761
WITHOUT IN THE LAW.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.562
BUT CHANGING IT TO JUST

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.130
HOSPITALIZATION SHOULD MAKE IT

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.999
MUCH MORE CLEAR AND SOMETHING

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.166

SUCCESS AND I THINK WE NEED.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:17.870
TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.406

ENGAGE MORE A WOMEN INTO THE

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.931
PROFESSIONS AND THIS TO THE IS

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.566
IN NEED OF HAPPY THOUGH TO

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.934
ANSWER I AGREE BEFORE I CAME

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.968
HERE WHEN THINGS I DID RUN WAS

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.403
OF PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM --

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.571
WITH THE BUILDING TRADES TO GET

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.673
NGUYEN IN ALL FOLKS INTO --

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.408
TRADE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS

00:07:55.474 --> 00:08:02.548
AND I WILL SAY I AM WITH.

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.417
GOING OUT AND RECRUITING WOMEN --

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:05.585
GETTING THEM TRAINED UP

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.453
GUARANTEEING THEM PUT BASICALLY

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.487
GUARANTEE THEM POSITIONS IN

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:09.055
APPRENTICESHIPS GUARANTEEING

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.323
THEM LIKE JOBS IMMEDIATELY

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.691
BECAUSE OF OF SOME -- FEDERAL

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:12.325
GOALS WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE --

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.894
WE WOULD HAVE WOMEN GO THROUGH

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.294
ARGUES BUILD A PRE

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.963
APPRENTICESHIP WHO AT THE END

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.164
WOULD SAY I JUST DON'T WANT TO

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.498
DO THIS AND SO.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.733
I I THINK I'M PROBABLY A LITTLE

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.534
SOFTER ON THE TRADE ON THIS

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:22.802
BECAUSE I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.937
RECRUITMENT RETENTION --

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.306
PROGRAMMING THAT WE TRY TO DEAL.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.941
IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE -- BUT WE

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.110
ALSO HAVE TO HAVE WOMEN WHO WANT

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.445
TO DO THIS WORK AND I'M AND

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.480
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SUCCESS

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.148
IT'S WILL FULL -- IF YOU

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.416
COMPARED OF COURSE TO NON UNION

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:38.651
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IT'S

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.720
OVERWHELMINGLY LIKE OVER 90% OF

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.723
THE WOMEN WHO ARE WHO GO ON TO

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.157
JOURNEY LEVEL POSITIONS ARE.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.225
GO THROUGH A JOINT LABOR

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.760
MANAGEMENT APPRENTICESHIP

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.528
PROGRAM -- SO SO THE THE TRADES

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.130
ARE DOING FAR BETTER THAN --

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.298
THEIR THEIR NON UNION

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.433
COUNTERPARTS -- BUT WE WE HAVE A

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.935
IT'S IT'S LARGER DISCUSSION AND

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.036
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT SOME GOALS

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.905
AND EVERYTHING BUT IT'S

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.239
SOMETHING I THINK WE MAYBE EVEN

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.607
US AS AS WOMEN LEGISLATORS HAVE

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:02.608
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:04.543
HOW DO WE GET WOMEN -- GIRLS

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.779
MORE EXCITED ABOUT THESE

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.614
OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE'VE

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.750
WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN --

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.752
AND KIND OF GO THROUGH THE STEPS

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.054
OF OF OF EVEN THE PRE

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.289
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BE LIKE

WHICH WE HAVE TO RESPECT I MEAN

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.193
WE CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO TAKE A

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.728
JOB THAT THEY DON'T WANT.

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.163
I'M MAEVE MAYBE WE'RE NOT

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.933

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.467
AND AND THIRTY THERE'S ALWAYS OF

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:29.869

BATHROOMS ON THE JOB SITE WHICH

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:37.443
I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.014
AND SHOULD ADDRESS.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.749

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:15.808
NUMBER.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:16.809
BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:21.113
RECRUITMENT EFFORTS SO THANK YOU

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.948

THEY'RE SOMETIMES ARE LITTLE

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.152
THINGS LIKE LACK OF BATHROOMS.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:27.153
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.654
WOMEN THEY CAN'T JUST GO OUT AND

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.790
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MEN TO IT

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.091
AS WELL THAT'S TRUE BUT OUR

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:32.725

THINK THAT IS IT.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.071
AND THESE ARE ALL GREAT -- BUT

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.539
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.841
IS ALWAYS HOW MANY WOMEN THESE

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.576

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.645
WORK IS I KNOW CAN BE DIFFICULT

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.414
AND CAN BE CHALLENGING -- BUT

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.116
THEY ARE THEY THEY DO GIVE

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:59.051
PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME

ARE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMETIMES

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.230
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.065
ACCOMMODATIONS.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:13.699
I KNOW JUDGE JUST TALKING TO A

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:14.600
WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE TECH

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:15.334
WORLD AND A LOT OF THEM START

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.203
THEIR OWN COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.170
CAN'T.

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.772
THERE'S A BROKE CULTURE.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.540
AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:24.276
BROKE KOCHHAR IN IN THE TRADES

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.946

AND THANK YOU IN IN THE WORLD I

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.417

AND WE NEED TO YES.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.487
THANK YOU I WAS TRYING TO BE

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:36.288
DIPLOMATIC BUT NO POINT TO THAT

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.524
SO I REALLY REALLY NEED TO WE

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.859
NEED TO INSIST I THINK THAT'S

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.393
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS YOU

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.962
KNOW IF WE HAVE O CHANGE THE

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:43.863
CULTURE WE HAVE TO CHANGE A

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:44.296
CULTURE.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.531
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.533
WOMEN INTO THESE JOBS IN SPITE

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.467
OF ALL THOSE EFFORTS WE'VE

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.469
TALKED I KNOW BEFORE ABOUT

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:51.604
GETTING.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.205
YOUNG WOMEN IT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:54.907
THEY'RE YOUNG GIRLS I'VE TALKED

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.876
TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OF WOMEN

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:57.643
WHO WERE IN THE TRADE TO THEIR

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.844
THEIR BECAUSE I HAD AN UNCLE IN

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.679
THE TRADE OR DAD IN THE NOTION

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:02.681
THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY EVEN.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.550
CONSIDER THAT AS AN OPTION -- IS

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.085
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO START

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.053
EARLIER BUT GETTING THEM INTO

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.788
THE TRAITS AND KEEPING THEM I

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:10.723
THINK THERE'S A TRUST IS

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.291
IMPORTANT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.959
FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO CREATE

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.794
THOSE INCENTIVES GRANTED IF THEY

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.630
DON'T WANT TO STAY IN THE JOB NO

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.398
ONE SHOULD FORCE ANYBODY WHY IS

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.866
IT THAT SO.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.368
MANY WOMEN LEAVE AND THAT'S

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.270
REALLY WHERE I TO SEE SOME

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.838
EFFORT THROUGH SOMEKIND OF

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.274
pEITHER CRITERIA OR PERCENT

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:28.741
SOMETHING.

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:30.075
THAT WE HAVEN'T SO WHERE WE SEE

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.210
A LOT MORE WOMEN IN THE FIELD

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.578
THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR JUST

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.146
ANSWER THAT WE TOTALLY AGREE

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.080
WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.649
MENTIONED AND WE ARE WORKING NOT

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:37.983
ONLY -- TO IN TERS OF THE

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.084
RECRUITMENT BUT ALSO THE

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.220
RETENTION RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:42.021
HAVE A GREAT WERE RECRUITED BUT

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.123
IF THE JOB SITE CULTURE.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.991
ISN'T ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.593
ACTUALLY STAY IN FEEL

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.794
COMFORTABLE AND FEEL SAFE THEN

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:49.895
WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND WE LOSE

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.096
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE LOSE

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.365
ALSO THAT INVESTMENT.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.133
IN THAT APPRENTICE BECAUSE IT

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.234
DOES.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.535
COST A LOT OF DOLLARS TO

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.003
ACTUALLY IS BEST IN THE TRAINING

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.637
FOR THAT PERSON.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.940
SO FOR THAT REASON LAST YEAR WE

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.174
RAN A BILL BY A SIMILAR MCCARTY

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.042

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:04.710
PARTNERSHIP PROTECTIONS FROM

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:05.277
HARASSMENT.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:06.845
HOW THE CURRICULUM HAVE TRAINING

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:08.581
FOR EVERY SINGLE APPRENTICE

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.381
THAT'S GOING THROUGH THAT

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:10.382
PROGRAM ARE ALSO EXTENDED

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.184
PROTECTIONS FOR OF THE

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.586
APPRENTICE ON THE JOB SITE SO

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:14.954
FOR EXAMPLE IF A CONTRACTOR?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.589
IS NOT FULFILLING THEIR

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.257
OBLIGATIONS FOR PROTECTING THAT

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.725
APPRENTICE FROM HARASSMENT

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.460
DISCRIMINATION OUR PARTNERSHIP

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.962
PROGRAMS CAN PULL THE APPRENTICE

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.563
BACK BECAUSE IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.497
HAVE AN APPRENTICE ON THE JOB

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:25.831
SITE.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.800
BIG BIG GET PAID 40% OF THE

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:29.168
PREVAILING WAGE RATE OF COURSE

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:30.236
IT'S LESS FOR WHAT THE

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:35.975
CONTRACTOR PAYS OUT.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.010
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:38.644
WE'RE DOING AND THEN THIS YEAR

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.645

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.446

DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS SO MY LAST

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:18.317
QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:19.585

TO YOU -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.424

CONSIDER TO ASSURE THAT -- THERE.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.765
THAT THAT WE SEE MORE WOMEN --

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.667
STAYING IN THESE FIELDS BECAUSE

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:35.734
THIS IS SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GOOD

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.037
VEHICLE. TO TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:41.473
WELL EVERYTHING REFERENCED -- BY --

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.075
MISTER DE AS IS IN THE BILL

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:44.209
BECAUSE OF THE APPRENTICESHIP

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.878
LANGUAGE ARE YOU SAID MC THREE

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:47.813
STUFF IS IN THE BILL VIA THE

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.081
APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE.

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.015
I'M.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.817
I WOULD REALLY SUGGEST JUST

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.085
GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE AND I

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:55.020
THERE'S A LOT I I THINK THAT THE

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:55.621
TRADES.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.122
ARE ARE CAPTURING AT THE JOB

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.990
LEVEL THE PERNICIOUS LEVEL

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.092
THAT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN I THINK

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.293
IN SOME WAYS IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.829
US TO NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT JUST A

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.331
WOMEN A GIRLS ISSUE THERE ARE A

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:08.634
LOT OF WE HAVE A GRAIN OF WORK

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.301
FORCE IF YOU WILL IN

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.002
CONSTRUCTION.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.770
AND A LOT OF THAT IN IN A LOT OF

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.539
THAT IS THIS IDEA THAT --

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.741
SOMEHOW GOING TO COLLEGE IS THE

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:21.413
PATH FOR EVERY FIRST GRADER.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.014
COMING AND GOING FIRST GRADER

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:22.514
YOU KNOW AND NOT REALLY

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.916
INTRODUCING A NUMBER OF OUR KIDS

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:25.017
TO ADD ALTERNATIVE PATH THAT IS

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.219
A GOOD JOB AND AND VALUING

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.887
CONSTRUCTION WORK AS WORK WE WE

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.689
DON'T TEND TO VALUE -- A LOT OF

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.491
WORK AND AND WE MAKE THAT VERY

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.059
CLEAR I THINK TO OUR SCHOOL AGE

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.462
CHILDREN -- IT'S IT'S WEIRD WITH

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:37.463
CONSTRUCTION WORK RIGHT BECAUSE

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.365
IT IS REALLY CAN BE A VERY GOOD

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.433
CAREER -- AND YET SOMEHOW YOU

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.169
KNOW WE WE DON'T EXPRESS THAT WE

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:44.837
CERTAINLY DON'T EXPRESS THAT TO

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.205
LITTLE GIRLS.

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:47.906
AND SO I I THINK WHERE.

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.708
WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN MAYBE NOT

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:50.809
THIS BILL BUT WE SHOULD THINK

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:51.777
ABOUT THIS BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:52.277
YOU IS.

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.546
IS HOW DO WE GET YOUNG GIRLS IN

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.448
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO START SEEN

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.183
THEM AT THIS IS A POSSIBILITY OF

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.419
A FUTURE FOR THEM YOU KNOW -- IF

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:01.687
YOU LOOK AT YOU YOU CAN GIVE A

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:04.022
HAMMER NOT A REAL ONE OF COURSE

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.724
TO I CAN GARNER MALE OR FEMALE

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:06.792
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO EQUALLY

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.293
PLAY WITH IT BUT BY THE TIME YOU

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.696
GET -- TO THESE WOMEN WHO ARE

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:14.833
YOU KNOW.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.467
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MAYBE

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.101
THEY'RE NOT SEEN THEMSELVES IN

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:16.735
THAT JOB SO I THINK WE HAVE WE

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.271
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY -- AND IN

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.372
THE TRADES I KNOW WHAT PARTNER

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.373
IN THAT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.508
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A STEEL

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.843
AND IT GOES LIKE I SAID ON THOSE

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.412
TWO FRONTS ONE HELPING YOUNG

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.247
WOMEN SEE THEMSELVES IN THAT.

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:30.949
JOB AND TO VALUING WORK I MEAN

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.718
VALUE IN WORKING WITH YOUR HANDS

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.286
AND DOING REAL WORK THAT DOESN'T

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.554
INCLUDE NECESSARILY A COLLEGE

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.189
DEGREE AND I THINK WE THOSE ARE

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.190
SOME OF THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:41.527
LACKING IN OUR HOW WE APPROACH.

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.061
SO OUR STUDENTS AND AND I AGREE

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.696
WITH EVERY BIT OF THAT I'M JUST

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:46.432
WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME KIND

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:47.666
OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAID A A

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:51.136
REQUIREMENT THAT HAS TO BE MET --

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:52.671
PEOPLE ARE.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.940
WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEET IT.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:56.642
AND AND I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.477
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO THAT

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.611
WOULD.

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:00.412
YOU KNOW KNOW WE HAVE FANS BUT

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.214
RIGHT EXCUSES FIGURE IT OUT GET

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.749
THERE I I'M JUST AFRAID WE

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.184
WOULDN'T THERE'S JUST NO

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.585
POSSIBLE WAY TO MEET THAT RIGHT

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:09.288

YOUNG WOMAN THROUGH THAT PROGRAM

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:09.147

BUILDING TRADES CONFERENCE A

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:28.367
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:29.201

CERTIFICATES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

THE BUILDING TRADES AND I THINK

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.917
IT'S THE OTHER WORK WE DO IT'S

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:47.586
EASY TO PUT OUT A QUOTA.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:48.687
BUT IF THE OTHER WORK WE DO IN

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.623
EDUCATION IT'S THE WORK WE'RE

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.425
DOING AROUND -- WORKPLACE

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:56.028
HARASSMENT.

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.429
THAT WILL CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.964
IN WHICH IT WILL BE SAFE AND

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.399
COMFORTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE TO

THE MET AND TALKED TO TALKED

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:12.678
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:14.680
WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN ON THE SIDE

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.081
IN THE SUPER BIZARRO POSITION.

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.783

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:08.520
WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN.

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:10.021
IT IS SIMPLY A PROHIBITION

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.189
AGAINST -- BINDING ARBITRATION

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:11.723
FORCE BINDING ARBITRATION

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.524
AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:14.960
EMPLOYMENT IT'S NARROWLY CRAFTED

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:17.162
TO HOPEFULLY AVOID ON THE THE

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.396
CHALLENGE OF A COURT DECISION --

00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:19.898
OF COURSE IT WILL GET TAKEN TO

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:20.432
COURT IF IT PASSES AND GET

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:21.066
SIGNED -- BUT WE THINK THIS IS

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:22.200
AN APPROACH THAT ENSURES THAT

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.735
ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.137
ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY WE

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.104
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.272
WRONG WITH ARBITRATION

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.940
AGREEMENTS WHEN TWO PARTIES

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.275
ENTER INTO IT VOLUNTARILY.

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.476
IT'S NOT MEANT TO DISCOURAGE THE

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:33.512
USE OF A VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.914
AGREEMENTS IT'S SIMPLY -- MEANT

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.550
TO ENSURE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.018
CREATE REALLY STRONG ROBUST

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.286

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.051
LAST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:22.354
CHALLENGES WOMEN FACE ON THE JOB

TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT THOSE AT

THOSE TEND TO HAPPEN TOGETHER --

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.567
ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF ABUSES

00:25:35.634 --> 00:25:36.801
THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN SUFFER

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:39.671
ON THE JOB AND THAT LOW WAGE

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:40.872

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.453
HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.521
TOGETHER.

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:57.989
NO ONE OUTSIDE THAT COMPANY

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.392
KNOWS THAT THE SAME PERSON IS

NEVER DEALT WITH BECAUSE IT

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.946
PROTECTED THE ABUSERS.

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:22.714
SADLY STATES ARE VERY LIMITED IN

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:23.949
WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THIS ARENA

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:25.517
THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.685
IS VERY BROAD.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.219
THAT'S WHY ALL THIS BILL DOES IS

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.587

OF ALL DISPUTES THEY CAN CLOSE

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:37.228
OFF YOUR ABILITY TO GO TO COURT

THE EMPLOYERS HIRED ARBITRATOR.

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:44.502

CHOICE STAFF TO TALK YOU INTO IT.

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.440
AND THE OPPONENTS OFTEN TALK

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.708
ABOUT HOW THEY THINK ARBITRATION

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:52.210
IS A BETTER SYSTEM FOR WORKERS

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.745
FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT'S IN

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:54.746
SPITE OF ALL THE RESEARCH

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:56.481
SHOWING THAT WORKERS LOSE AN

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:57.082
ARBITRATION.

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:58.350
THE WORDS ARE MUCH SMALLER AN

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.884
ARBITRATION BUT THEY SAY THEY

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.286
ARE VERY GOOD FOR WORKERS ARE

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:02.654
ARGUMENTIS.

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:03.621
THEN PERSUADE WORKERS TO SIGN

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:05.423
THESE AGREEMENTS DON'T MAKE THE

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.527

DON'T HAVE CHOICE IS.

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:32.150
DIFFERENT THAN A PROCESS WHERE

OFTEN THE WORKERS WHEN AND ALSO

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.815
BECAUSE WORKERS JUST ARE

DISCOURAGED TO GO THROUGH THIS

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.751

BRINGING CLAIMS SO.

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.132

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.794
TO BE VOLUNTARY AND THAT YOU

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:31.129
CAN'T DO IT AS A CONDITION OF A

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:31.996
CONTRACT.

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:32.864
THIS BILL IS THAT PROPONENTS

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:34.566
HAVE A PRESENTED SAYS THAT AS A

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.267
CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.202
YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:37.936
CLAUSE.

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.103
THE BILL WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.338
SECOND DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.573
AND THE DECISION SAYING IT WAS

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.675
ALSO THAT LIMITATION ON THE

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:45.143
CREATION OF AN ARBITRATION

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.477
AGREEMENT WAS ALSO PREEMPTED AND

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.845
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SO I

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:48.079
AGREE.

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.480
WITH PROPONENTS AGREE OF THE

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:51.049
AUTHOR THAT THISBILL -- IF

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:51.950
PASSED WILL BE CHALLENGED IN

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.785
COURT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.420
IT WILL LIKELY BE STRUCK DOWN AS

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.588
WELL AS PRINTED IN THE FEDERAL

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:58.056
ARBITRATION ACT JUST LIKE THE

00:30:58.122 --> 00:30:59.958
WEBER BILL WAS AND LIKE SEVERAL

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.126
BILLS AND OTHER A STATE LAWS

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.161
HAVE DONE UNDER THE SUPREME

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:04.262
COURT SO.

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:06.130
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T IT

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:07.632
DOESN'T BENEFIT THE EMPLOYER I

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.567
CAN OBVIOUSLY SAY THAT.

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:10.568
THE EMPLOYER WILL BE LEFT IN

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:12.036
UNCERTAINTY -- AND WILL BEAR THE

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.304
COST OF LITIGATION I DON'T SEE

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.872
HOW THAT BENEFITS THE EMPLOYEES

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:16.541
WHEN YOU HAVE UNCERTAINTY WITH

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:17.141
REGARDS TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.177
RIGHTS -- AND THE OTHER CONCERN

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:22.680
THAT I HAVE IS THAT IF YOU LIMIT --

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.182
DO USE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.717
WHICH THE IF THIS BILL IT GOES

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:26.351
FOR IT AS INTENDED WILL

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.253
CERTAINLY DO -- THE OTHER

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.854
OPTIONS FOR AN EMPLOYEE ARE THE

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.022
LABOR COMMISSIONER HEARING OR

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:31.889
GOING TO COURT AS AGAIN THE

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.691
PROPONENTS MENTIONED WE DON'T

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.460
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE LABOR

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:36.094
COMMISSIONER HEARING IN FACT --

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.662
I THINK THAT THAT'S AN EFFICIENT

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.163
AND EFFECTIVE WAY MUCH TO

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:44.302
RESOLVED LABOR DISPUTES --

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.070
WITHOUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:46.604
LITIGATION WHICH INCLUDES

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:47.772
OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT COURT

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:48.306
COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:49.240
INCLUDED IN THAT -- BUT THE

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.475
OTHER PATHWAY IS LITIGATION --

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:51.709
AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:52.543
PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.746
GREAT -- BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.180
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND A

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.882
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:58.449
SENATOR MITCHELL'S PROBABLY

00:31:58.516 --> 00:31:59.384
FAMILIAR WITH.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.418
CAME OUT THIS YEAR AND SAID THAT

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.620
THEY WOULDN'T THEY REVIEWED OVER

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.821
FIFTEEN HUNDRED SETTLEMENTS THAT

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.189
WERE DONE UNDER THE LABOR CODE.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.558
IN 75% OF THOSE CASES THEY FELL

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.294
ON THAT THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.762
FAILED OR GOT A MARGINALLY

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.430
PASSING RATE FOR PROTECTING

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:13.398
WORKERS INTERESTS.

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.432
MEANING THAT THEY WERE IN

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.034
ADEQUATE AND PROTECTING WORKERS

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.502
INTEREST ON THE DEBT LABOR CODE

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:18.870
AND SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE BANNING

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.371
ARBITRATION OR LIMITING THE USE

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.506
OF ARBITRATION AND YOU HAVE TO

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.540
PATHWAYS WHEN THE LABOR

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:23.708
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WHICH

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:24.809
CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:26.444
FUNDING TO RESOURCES --

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:28.246
AVAILABLE TO HANDLE THESE CASES

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:28.913
AND THEN YOU'RE SENDING THEM TO

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.648
LITIGATION YOU'RE SENDING THEM

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:31.816
TO A FORUM IN WHICH THERE HAS

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.918
BEEN A FINDING BY OUR INDUSTRIAL

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.620
RELATIONS AGENCY NOT ME.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.721
NOT THE BUSINESS GROUPS BUT OUR

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.456
LABOR AGENCY IN WHICH THEY SAID

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:39.290
THAT THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL HAVE

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:40.792
FAILED IN PROTECTING WORKERS

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.327
INTERESTS SO AGAIN I DON'T SEE

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.494
HOW THIS BILL BENEFITS EMPLOYERS

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.063
I CAN SIR YOU IT DOESN'T BENEFIT

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:45.897
EMPLOYERS.

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.265
I DON'T SEE HOW PROTECT SIMPLY

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.000
INTERESTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.468
WE ARE POST THANK YOU.

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:51.436
PLEASE DON'T HI CAM STONE ON

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:52.337
BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:54.472
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAN

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.640
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION.

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:58.009
ARBITRATION IS A LEGITIMATE FAIR

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.444
AND EFFICIENT WAY TO RESOLVE

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.146
DISPUTES -- I THINK AT SOME OF

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.281
THE UNION GROUPS AGREE WITH THAT

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:04.482
BECAUSE THERE IS A BILL LAST

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.783
YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE TO ALLOW

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.952
UNION GROUPS TO USE ARBITRATION

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.521
TO RESOLVE PAGA -- CLAIMS IN IN

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:11.989
LAWSUITS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:13.491
PROBLEM THEY WANT THAT PROBLEM

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.393
SOLVED AND THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.961
STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE WERE --

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.197
SURVEYED AFTER EMPLOYMENT

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:21.766
LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION AND

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.668
LITIGATION YIELDED ROUGHLY THE

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:25.169
SAME RESULTS BUT PEOPLE ON

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.437
SOMEONE IRONICALLY FELT MORE

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.638
HEARD LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR DAY

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:28.639
IN COURT WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.341
ARBITRATION THEN IF THEY HAD

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:30.908
GONE THROUGH.

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:33.745
LITIGATION THE EIGHTEEN T.

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.213
VERSUS CONCEPCION A UNITED

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.981
STATES SUPREME COURT CONTAINED

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.916
AN ARBITRATION -- AGREEMENT THAT

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:44.622
WAS UNDER ATTACK THAT WAS VERY

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.190
VERY PRO CONSUME THE WAY THAT

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:47.191
WORKS IS IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:48.326
YOU -- SUBMITTED YOUR PROBLEM

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:48.926
AND EIGHTEEN T. MADE YOU AN

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:49.260
OFFER TO RESOLVE IT IF YOU

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.129
DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT CLAIM AND

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:52.063
THE ARBITER.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.598
AWARDED MORE THAN EIGHTEEN T.

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.867

TWO TIMES YOUR ATTORNEY'S FEES.

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.838
SO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS CAN IN

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.508
OUR CRAFTED IN LEGITIMATE AND

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.076
FAIR WAY IS THE REASONS THAT

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.611
EMPLOYERS LIKE TO USE THEM IS

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.479
THAT IT -- REDUCES THE

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.947
UNCERTAINTY AND UNPREDICTABILITY

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:12.784
OF SORT OF A JACKPOT JUSTICE OR

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.951
A RUNAWAY VERDICT THAT WOULD BE

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:17.388
VERY DIFFICULT. TO ABSORB --

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.157
CALIFORNIA LAW ARMAND ARE IS AND

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:22.093

AGREEMENTS AND CLAUSES IN

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.698
CONTRACTS THAT MUST BE FAIR IF

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.100
THEY ARE UNCONSCIONABLE OR

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.068
UNFAIR JOB -- JUDGES WILL NOT

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:33.104
ENFORCE THEM BECAUSE ARBITRATION

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.405
IS A LEGITIMATE FAIR AND

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:35.273
EFFICIENT WAY OF RESOLVING

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:37.141
DISPUTES WE BELIEVE IT CAN AND

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.243

THINK ARBITRATION FORCED

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:29.954
ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE WORST

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:30.855
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.490
UNDERMINE JUSTICE IN THIS

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.626
COUNTRY.

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:36.260
THESE ARE NOT VOLUNTARY.

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:39.764
ARE THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS --

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.999
IT BASICALLY REMOVES THE ABILITY

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.368
OF PEOPLE TO HAVE MATTERS HEARD

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.970
BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS.

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:48.372
I ATE IT BAFFLES ME THAT THE

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.774
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.009
SAID THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:53.811
AND CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.080
THAT BEING SAID AS I UNDERSTAND

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.950
THIS BILL IT'S BASICALLY

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.251
VOLUNTARY.

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.852
IT DOESN'T IT JUST SIMPLY SAYS

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.721
AN EMPLOYER CAN SAY TO YOU WE

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.656
WOULD LIKE YOU AS A CONDITION OF

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:07.692
EMPLOYMENT TO AGREE TO THIS

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:07.992
[inaudible]

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.127
ARM.

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:12.930
THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT THIS --

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:15.800
BILL REDUCES OR THAT THIS

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:20.004
UNDERMINES -- THE ABILITY OF

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.239
EMPLOYERS TO ANTICIPATE WHAT'S

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:26.611
GOING ON IN THERE -- EFFORTS --

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.945
I'D LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:29.614
BECAUSE I CAN'T.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.181
I CAN'T FIGURE THAT ONE OUT

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:34.452
MYSELF -- AND ALSO OF RESPOND TO

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:37.655
THE CLAIM.

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.489
I ALWAYS FIND SO INTERESTING

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:39.824
THAT EMPLOYEES ARE WELL

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.592
PROTECTED BY.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.161
THE RIGHT. TO TO SUE AND HAVE

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:45.997
THEIR DAY IN COURT IS IS

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:48.232
PROMISED UNDER WHAT I HAS AT

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:51.535
LEAST AS I READ THE CONSTITUTION.

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.070
COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE TWO

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:58.409
ISSUES SURE -- FIRST I IT'S HARD.

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.244
TO IN SOME WAYS DRESSED ME -- TO

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.278
EXPLAIN THE OPPOSITION'S

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.214
IRRATIONAL OPPOSITION AS I SEE

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.382
IT I'M FROM A WORKER ADVOCATE

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:04.882
POSITION.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.917
AT I UNDERSTAND AS

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:09.487
REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESS --

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:12.023
YA THEY PREFER ARBITRATION --

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:13.024
IT'S SECRETIVE THERE'S NO

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.093
APPEALS PROCESS ITS FINAL -- WE

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.162
DON'T KNOW IF THINGS COME OUT

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:19.397
FAIRLY IF THERE'S A

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:21.932
MISAPPLICATION OF LAW THERE'S NO

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:24.068
WAY TO APPEAL THAT -- SO TERE

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.770
IS CERTAINTY FOR THE EMPLOYER

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:28.072
ABSOLUTELY -- BUT AT THE COST OF

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.306
WHAT AT THE COST OF THE PUBLIC

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.641
POLICY THAT WE PUT FORWARD IN

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.943
THIS BUILDING AND PROMOTED AS

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.078
WHAT WE WANT FOR THE STATE OF

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.414
CALIFORNIA -- YOU CANNOT COMPARE

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.816
UNION COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ART

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:39.950
ARBITRATION I'M WITH AN

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.419
INDIVIDUAL WORKER YOU KNOW

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.455
ANYTIME ARBITRATION MADE WORK

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:45.089
WELL.

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.791
WHEN YOU HAVE A EQUALS AND WHO

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.426
CAN VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.461
SOMETHING AND HAVE -- UNMEDIATED

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:52.730
DISCUSSION BASICALLY ABOUT ABOUT

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:53.597
WHERE THINGS SHOULD GO AND

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:55.566
EVERYBODY HAS EQUAL RESOURCES IN

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:56.200
FIGHTING THAT.

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:57.268
THAT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:58.269
SITUATION THAN YOU HAVE AN

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.737
INDIVIDUAL WORKER AND THE

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:00.871
WORKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.573
BUYING FAR -- MANY OF THEM DON'T

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.208
SPEAK ENGLISH -- MANY OF THEM

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.010
ARE IMMIGRANTS LOW WAGE WORKERS

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.511
WHO WHO MAY NOT HAVE FORMAL

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:08.546
EDUCATION DEFINITELY ARE NOT

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:10.781
ATTORNEYS -- AND WHO ARE LEFT TO

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:11.916
FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN A

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:14.685
SECRETIVE PROCESS -- IF THE

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:17.321
EMPLOYERS ARE CORRECT AND AND

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.223
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SO MUCH

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.958
BETTER FOR THE WORKER.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.259
AT THE EIGHT UNDER THIS BILL

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:24.195
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.629
EXPLAIN THAT TO THE WORKER AND

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:27.965
GIVE THEM THAT INFORMATION PRIOR

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:28.799
TO ASKING BEEN SIGNED

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.000
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:31.769
THAT MAKE CREE ANOTHER PROBLEM I

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.604
SEE COMMON BUT THEY DO IT WOULD

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.239
HAVE THAT RIGHT -- AND IT WOULD

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:37.508
BE THE WORKERS CHOICE THAN TO

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.110
DECIDE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.611
SIGN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT --

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:42.947
IT WOULDN'T TAKE AWAY THE THE

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.615
OPPORTUNITY FOR ARBITRATION IF

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.484
BOTH THE WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.753
DECIDED THAT'S THE BEST ROUTE

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:51.422
HOWEVER -- WE KNOW THAT THE

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:53.457
CONSTITUTION DOES GIVE

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:54.992
INDIVIDUALS A RIGHT.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:59.463
TO REDRESS IN COURT SYSTEM IT'S

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.931
AMAZING TO ME THAT THE COURT

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:02.433
SYSTEM ITSELF IS TRYING TO TAKE

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.667
THAT AWAY ARE ALLOWING -- SO

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.002
MANY BIG CORPORATIONS TAKE THAT

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.337
RATE FROM INDIVIDUALS I'M I I

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:07.404
THINK THAT'S SCARY I A I THINK

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.106
THAT THAT TWEET WE NEED TO LOOK

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:12.576
AT THAT AND AS FAR AS THE

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.445
ANTICIPATION OF OF LARGE

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:16.647
SETTLEMENTS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.716
EMPLOYERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE LAW --

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.117
AND AND THEN PERHAPS FOLLOW ALL

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.752
THE LAWS WE SET OUT IN AND

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.420
PERHAPS THEN THEY DON'T NEED TO

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:25.256
ANTICIPATE -- HUGE SETTLEMENTS

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.557
AGAINST I'M I MEAN I I THINK

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.092
WE'RE PRETTY CLEAR ON

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.226
REQUIREMENTS -- FOR EMPLOYERS

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.995
YES THERE CAN BE SOME PROBLEMS

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:33.030
AND AND WE DEAL WITH THOSE --

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.865
BUT FOR THE MOST PART IF YOU RUN

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:37.601
A BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY AND YOU

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.203
ARE CLEARLY FOLLOWING THE LAW --

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.938
YOU DON'T GET AN ANTICIPATED

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:43.507
HUGE SETTLEMENTS AGAINST YOU --

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.709
THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LAWS --

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.946
SO THAT THAT TO ME SEEMS A

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.147
LITTLE -- AN EASY.

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:51.582
AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.617
GOING TO BE CHALLENGED -- I WILL

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.920
POINT OUT THAT LAST YEAR AND I

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.188
BELIEVE THIS YEAR AS WELL AND I

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:57.922
HAVE TO GO CHECK SINCE I

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:59.156
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T SEND OUT CO

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.158
AUTHOR FORMS -- THAT THE

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.526
ATTORNEY GENERAL SUPPORTS THIS

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.061
SO THE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD%

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:07.832
BE TASKED WITH DEFENDING IN --

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:14.205
THIS BILL.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.473
AT ARGUED IN ALL OF THESE CASES

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.475
IN AN IN HAS BEEN AT THE

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.110
FOREFRONT IN THE COURT.

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.346
ON THESE -- CASES IN THE PAST

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.181
AND TOOK ALL OF THE DISCUSSION

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:25.749
AND ALL THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT --

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.718
THE JUDGE'S DECISION WAS TO HELP

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.887
US CRAFT A BILL THAT HE THINKS

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.188
AND WE THINK CAN STAND UP TO

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.190
JUDICIAL SCRUTINY -- WILL

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.825
SOMEBODY SO ABSOLUTELY THAT'S

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:36.527
WHAT HAPPENS BUT DO WE AS

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:38.262
CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.396
WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THE

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:41.565
AVAILABILITY TO PURSUE THEIR

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:44.935
CLAIMS -- IT VOLUNTARILY THROUGH

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.470
A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING A

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:48.105
LABOR COMMISSIONER WHERE THERE

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.874
IS NO NEED FOR AN ATTORNEY -- IN

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.343
COURT BECAUSE MAYBE SOMETHING IS

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:53.944
SO -- BROAD THAT YOU KNOW

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.846
AFFECTING SO MANY WORKERS IN A

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:58.282
CERTAIN -- INDUSTRY OR OR SO

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.916
IMPORTANT THAT IT'S A PUBLIC

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.085
POLICY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.753
BROUGHT OUT IN PUBLIC AND WE SAW

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.021
THAT A LOT WITH WITH THE SEXUAL

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:04.822
HARASSMENT.

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:06.223
AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.058
THAT WE WE'VE SEEN IN SOME THESE

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.828
LOW WAGE -- JOBS AT OR IF THEY

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.763
PREFER TO HANDLE SOMETHING AND

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.665
IN ARBITRATION I MEAN THE WORKER

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.233
THEMSELVES SHOULD HAVE THOSE

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.701
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:18.836
SHOULDN'T SAY.

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:20.037
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:22.172
ALL THESE RIGHTS -- YOU CAN'T

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.507
HELP THE STOP AND THAT'S ALL

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:26.744
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IN I'M

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.179
MIGHT IF I COULD ADD TO THIS

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:29.480
[inaudible]

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:33.517
OF CONCEPT WAS DESIGNED BETWEEN

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:34.985
TWO TO BE AVAILABLE TO

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.186
BUSINESSES.

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.255
WHO MIGHT PREFERRED TO GO

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:41.625
THROUGH A MORE EXPEDITIOUS

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.027
PROCESS IN?

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:44.728
REACHING RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:45.829
THAT THEY WERE HAVING WITH OTHER

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:49.133
BUSINESSES OF EQUAL STATURE IN

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:56.073
AN EQUAL -- FINANCIAL -- THE

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.542
QUALITY IF YOU WILL AND AS WE'VE

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:02.713
SEEN I THINK -- THE THE THE ACT

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.315
THE FEDERAL ACT BEING REALLY

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:06.016
SUBVERTED BECAUSE IF I'M NOT

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.685
MISTAKEN WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.987
PASSED THAT WAS THE FOCUS.

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:11.555
ON THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES WHO

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.524
WERE IN DISPUTE WITH EACH OTHER

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.992
TO COME UP WITH RESOLUTION AT

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.194
THE IN AN EARLIER.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.529
STAGE SO.

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.597
I VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE A

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.700
CO AUTHOR I I REALLY BELIEVE

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:25.769
THAT THIS LAW HAS BEEN --

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.004
MISAPPLIED.

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:29.640
THE SUPREME COURT TO SUPREME

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:32.076
COURT I YOU KNOW AM HUMBLED BY.

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:33.711
THEIR POWER.

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.412
I STILL THINK THE WRONG -- AND I

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:36.613
THINK THE MORE THEY KEEP PUSHING

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.882
THIS THE MORE IT UNDERMINES AND

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.751
SUBVERTS WHAT I THINK WAS A VERY

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.553
WELL INTENDED EFFORT. TO GIVE

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.922
OPTIONS AND THERE ARE

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.123
ARBITRATION.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.558
ARBITRATORS WHO DO A WONDERFUL

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:49.193
JOB.

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:50.995
BUT THE SYSTEM HAS SUCH A THUMB

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.230
ON THE SCALE OF THE QUALITY OF A

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.466
JUSTICE FOR BOTH SIDES IN THIS

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:56.700
CASE IN PARTICULAR WITH

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.168
EMPLOYERS AND WITH SOME OF THE

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.303
OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.437
ABOUT SO.

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.940
I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS AND IF

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.742
THIS IS A CASE THAT WILL GO UP

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:07.511
TO THE COURTS SO BE IT BUT AGAIN.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.079
IF THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.147
IF WE GET A CONGRESS THAT

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.082
ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CONSUMERS

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.618
AND AND EMPLOYEES MIGHT TAKE

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:15.853
ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS LAW ON A

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.621
FEDERAL BASIS I FRANKLY THINK IT

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.123
WOULD BE INCUMBENT UPON US TO

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.691
HELP LEAD AS CALIFORNIA DOES SO

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:21.592
OFTEN.

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:24.028
IN TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHAT ARE

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.796
THE TRUE VALUES OF THE SOCIETY

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.399

OF HIM [inaudible]

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:42.199
BEFORE -- THE MIDDLE ONE IS WHEN

THEN WITH A LONG INFECTION.

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:08.959
HE WASN'T DIAGNOSED UNTIL TWO

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.594
YEARS LATER.

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.496
WITH VALLEY FEVER AT THAT TIME

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:14.932
WAS LIVING IN PHOENIX SO FEW

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.534

THE SPORT THEY GOT INTO HIS BODY

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:23.774
AND STARTED SPREADING TO WHAT IS

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.007
BEHIND.

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:26.076
IN HIS BRAIN.

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.411
IN THE PLEDGE THAT TO SEE HIS

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:30.013
BRAIN STOPPED WORKING -- I HAVE

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.616
SECOND SON.

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.219
HE HAS VALLEY FEVER.

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:38.255
AND HAD WE KNOWN ABOUT THIS WE

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.156
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.124
THINGS ABOUT IT MY SENSE WOULD

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:43.760
HAVE NEVER BEEN PLAYING ON BASE.

00:47:43.827 --> 00:47:46.797
IN JACK RABBIT FEEL.

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.665
FILLING DIRT BOMBS AT EACH OTHER --

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:49.967
MAYBE MY OLDEST SON WOULD NEVER

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:53.337
WENT TO WORK AT A OF A COMPANY

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.872
THAT DEALS WITH FARMING.

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.641
IN THE COURT FEELS.

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.509
I'VE BEEN TESTED.

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.911
IT'S IN MY SYSTEM.

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:09.853
BUT I DO HAVE SYMPTOMS.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.156
SO I AM FOR THIS AND I DO A LOT

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.358
ADVOCATING IN MY COMMUNITY.

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:15.993
TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND

TELLING THEM GET TESTED AND IF

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.263
YOUR DOCTOR WILL TEST YOU GO TO

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.664
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.432
MY SECOND SON HIS DOCTOR WOULD

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:23.634
NOT TEST THEM.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.369
BECAUSE HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:26.003
SYMPTOMS.

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.804
BUT HIS GIRLFRIEND MAKE SURE

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.773

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.743
SHE TALKED TO HIM THE CIVIL

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:35.679
TESTIMONY CAME BACK POSITIVE.

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.147
RIGHT NOW MY SON CAN'T WORK.

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.316
IS A LOT OF PAIN HE CAN'T SLEEP.

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.617
SOMETIMES HE HAS NO APPETITE TO

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.286

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:46.690

AND YES YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.789
SHOWING UP NOT ONLY IN VENTURA

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.391
THROUGH THE FIRE BUT AFTER THE

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.458
DEBRIS FLOW.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:31.194
A MUD SLIDE IN SANTA BARBARA

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:31.395
THAT.

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.462
WE'RE SEEING THIS.

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.096
IF SOMEONE IS TESTED IS THERE

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.632
TREATMENT AVAILABLE THAT CAN

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:39.770
EITHER REDUCE OR CURE OR YOU

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:42.172
KNOW ASSIST IN.

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:43.673
RESOLVING THIS DISEASE SO THAT

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.009
PEOPLE CAN GO ON TO LIVE HEALTHY

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.544
IN LONG LIVES SO CURRENTLY THERE

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:49.646
IS A NO VACCINE OR CURE FOR

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.681
VALLEY FEVER -- IN LAST YEAR'S

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:53.750
BUDGET -- THROUGH THE GRACES OF

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.152
EVERYBODY HERE WE WERE ABLE TO

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:56.520
INCLUDE SOME MONEY.

00:50:56.586 --> 00:50:57.988
FOR FUNDING WHICH IS NOW GOING

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.689
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.224
TO ACTUALLY RESEARCH TRY.

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.325
TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE WE

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.894
CAN GET TO POSSIBLY A VACCINE

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.130
AND A CURE -- BUT THAT'S YOU

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:07.764
KNOW SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.199
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:10.600
THAT FIGHT A NO FEDERALLY

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.635
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THIS AS

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:15.205
WELL -- ALL IT'S VERY ENDEMIC TO

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:16.440
THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST.

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.074
OF THE UNITED STATES SO YOU SEE

00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:20.811
A LOT OF NUMBERS AND YOU MEXICO.

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:23.046
ARIZONA HAS A LOT OF MY NUMBERS

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.448
TAXES OBVIOUSLY HERE IN

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:27.017
CALIFORNIA WE DID THE RESEARCH.

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.152
OF THE EXCUSE ME OF THE HUNDRED

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:30.487
AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNREPORTED

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:34.024
CASES WE FOUND FIFTY OUT OF THE

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:37.194
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT WAS

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.428
CASES AND FIFTY OF COUNTIES.

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:40.096
IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:40.597
WE'VE BEEN MOVING THIS.

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:41.465
WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THE

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:42.532
GOVERNOR SIGNED THREE PIECES OF

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.267
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THIS IS

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:46.269
THE FOURTH PIECE -- THAT WE'RE

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.938
TRYING TO GET THAT FOR WORKERS

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:48.772
HAVE CAL OSHA STEP IN.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.674
A LOT OF TIMES WE FIND TO FOR

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.609
INSTANCE LIKE IT WAS MENTIONED

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.077
EARLIER FROM PAULA.

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:56.446
IS THERE WAS A CREW OUT IN SAN

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:58.181
LUIS OBISPO COUNTY THAT WAS

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.850
INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS.

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.218
AND EVERYBODY ON THE CREW CAME

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:02.252
DOWN WITH VALLEY FEVER.

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.620
AND YOU ASK WHAT COULD WE HAVE

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:05.055
DONE TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.923
THAT ESPECIALLY THESE ENDEMIC

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.557
AREAS.

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.960
AND SAID YOU KNOW IT'S PUTTING

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.828
ON A AND NINETY FIVE TO MASK.

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:12.829
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN IN

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:13.697
NINETY FIVE MASS THAT WOULD HAVE

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:14.397
HELPED.

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.765
SO MAYBE WE CAN GET CAL OSHA TO

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:16.666
SET THE STANDARDS ESPECIALLY

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.602
THESE HIGHLY ENDEMIC AREAS TO

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:21.004
HOPEFULLY PREVENT PEOPLE.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.739
FROM GETTING BALLOT ARE THERE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.542
TREATMENTS THOUGH IF IF IF WE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.443
CAN PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED THEY GET

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.211
TESTED THEY FIND THEY HAVEN'T

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.213
WHAT CAN WE DO TO ASSIST THEM.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.582
YEAH SO THERE'S A THERE THERE'S

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.550
SOME MEDICATION THAT THEY CAN'T

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:34.684
TAKE EVERYONE'S RESPONDING

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.353
DIFFERENTLY TO IT AND I THINK

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:37.787
pCOMING IN.

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.089
BECAUSE I KNOW -- SOME OF THE

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.323
RESEARCH IS LOOKING AT GENETIC

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.391
MARKERS BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:42.993
MORE PREVALENT.

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.562
AND AND SOME ETHNICITIES AND

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:51.201
OTHERS -- AFRICAN AMERICAN IS

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:51.701
ONE OF THEM [inaudible]

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.136
AND AND SO THE RESEARCH RIGHT

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.838
NOW.

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:55.438
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.474
THIS I WOULD I WAS JUST AT UCSF --

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.542
TWO WEEKENDS AGO -- ACTUALLY

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.477
DISCUSSING SOME OF THE RESEARCH

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.177
THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR UC

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:03.313
MERCED IS ANOTHER ONE UNIVERSITY

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.581
OF ARIZONA.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:05.849
I WITH DOCTOR GALGIANI IS

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:10.120
ANOTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY RELATED

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:14.858
TO OUR SENATOR GALGIANI.

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:17.894

THANK YOU CENTER EXHAUST FOR

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:21.464
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:22.699
ABOUT HE WAS ACTUALLY FUNGAL

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:23.533
INFECTION AND FUNGAL INFECTIONS

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.834
ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TREAT --

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:26.636
THE MEDICATIONS OFTEN HAS TO

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:30.206
MAKE SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS --

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:32.943
AND AND TENSION IS AS THE

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:33.610
BRIGHTON OFFICE ONLY WE NEED TO

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:34.544
TRY TO WORK ON TREATMENTS AND

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.646
CURES -- BUT FUNGAL INFECTIONS

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.748
IN GENERAL OR IS IT EXTREMELY

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:41.818
DIFFICULT TO TREAT AND OFTEN AND

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:42.586
SAID -- THE TREATMENTS AND CELLS

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:43.820
ARE VERY DIFFICULT WE DO NEED

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.956
MORE RESEARCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.691
LEADERSHIP -- WE THAT THAT

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:48.692
PREVENTION PART IS A VERY

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.293
IMPORTANT -- I I SHOULD MENTION

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.995
THAT IF YOU'VE NEVER WORN AND

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:54.431
PROPERLY FITTED AND NINETY FIVE

00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:55.565
MASK.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:57.300
YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT

00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:00.470
IS ACTUALLY TO WORK WEARING ONE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.106
FOR AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME --

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.908
SO WE REALLY GOT THINK ABOUT

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:07.444
RIGHTY OF MITIGATION APPROACHES

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.511
AND CERTAINLY THINK THE RATE

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.714
THAT HAVE CAL OSHA LOOK AT THAT

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.848
FOR CLIMATE CHANGE UNFORTUNATELY

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:15.151
IS ALSO CHANGING THE AREAS RIGHT

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.519
BECAUSE IT'S A SORT OF A CLIMATE

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.221
THAT THE FUNGUS THRIVES IN.

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.723
AND SO THAT IS POTENTIALLY

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:20.590
EXPANDING THE AREAS IN WHICH

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.592
THIS FONG I COULD SPREAD AND BE

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.494
ENDEMIC IN THE SOIL SOMETHING WE

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:25.795
NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT AS

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:26.730
WELL.

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.965
AND CERTAINLY -- I APPRECIATE --

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.634
THAT WE'VE INVESTED SOME OF OUR

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.869
STATE FUNDS IN TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:33.970
THIS ISSUE AND RAISE AWARENESS I

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:34.871
THINK IT'S THE OTHER THING I

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:35.972
HEARD FROM THE WITNESS LIKE WITH

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.474
THE DOCTORS AND PUBLIC HEALTH

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.775
FOLKS IN THE NURSES NEED TO KNOW

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:40.010
THEY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.111
VALLEY FEVER IT'S NOT.

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:43.713
ALWAYS NO OBVIOUS THAT'S NOT

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.048
LIKE IF SOMEONE COMES IN THE

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.349
VALLEY FEVER RIGHT INTO IT'S A

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:47.183
THE SYMPTOMS ARE -- SOMEWHAT --

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.386
INITIALLY INITIALLY SOMEWHAT

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:51.721
AMBIGUOUS AND THE PROBLEM IS

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.456
THEN WHEN YOU GET REALLY SICK --

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.558
THAN YOU KNOW AND BUT THEN IT'S

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.027
THE RATHER LATE SO THANKS SO

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.173
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A SAFE

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.175
WORKPLACE AND AND IT'S OUR DUTY

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:14.010
TO DO THAT AND PROVIDE THAT --

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:15.378
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED LOOKING AT

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:17.080
THE PERHAPS WHEN PROVIDING THE

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.315
TRAINING OR THE MATERIALS IN THE

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:22.185
LANGUAGES THAT MAY BE SPECIFIC.

PEOPLE PERHAPS YOU COULD LOOK AT

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.788
THAT YES NO WE DID AND WE

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.991
ACTUALLY HAD A SEPARATE PIECE OF

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.493
UNFORTUNATELY TO ACTUALLY EXPAND --

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.895
THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FOR A

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.563
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO WE

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.731
HAVE WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT BUT

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:37.133
MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT WITH THE

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.470
STAKEHOLDERS AND SEE WHAT WE CAN.

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:41.638
WE CAN DO TO DEVELOP MORE.

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.106
OF WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AT NOT

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:43.707

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:47.610
IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT'S

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.746
AFFECTING A LOT OF FOLKS --

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:50.413
INCLUDING PEOPLE HERE IN OUR

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.614
BUILDING.

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.516
RIGHT -- WITH SENATOR FULLER BUT

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:54.751
ALSO WITH THE SIMPLY MEMBER

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.720
GRAYSON WHO ACTUALLY CONTRACTED

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.521
VALLEY FEVER AND HE TALKS ABOUT

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.323
WHAT DOCTOR PANELS TALKING ABOUT.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.325
THE MISDIAGNOSIS WHERE PEOPLE

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:03.793
THOUGHT IT WAS THE FLU OR OR A

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.295
COMMON COLD AND SO HE GETS

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.263
ANTIBIOTICS WHICH DO NOTHING

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.898
BECAUSE IT'S A FUNGAL DISEASE.

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.834
AND SO -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.569

IN THE EMPLOYEE IS IRRETRIEVABLY

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.308
PENALIZE SO BASICALLY THIS IS

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.376
ONE YEAR ACROSS THE BOARD FROM

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.978

OF THE WITH WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS.

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.482
WHERE YOU HAVE EMBEZZLEMENT

COMING FORWARD AND DISCOVERY?

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.893
SO THERE ARE SOME CARVED

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.661
EXCEPTIONS BUT WITH THIS.

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:42.565
BILL DOES IS IT.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.066
IT TAKES.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:44.434
THE GENERAL RULE WILL NOW BE ONE

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:44.967
YEAR.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.135
WHICH OF PARALLELS WHAT HAPPENS

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.970
WITH PEACE OFFICERS NOW FOR

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.505
EXAMPLE RIGHT MY CONCERN THOUGH

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.940
IS IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:52.208
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.343
IT'S THREE YEARS FROM THE TIME

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:57.080
OF DISCOVER YOU THEY STILL GET

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.048
THREE YEARS TO INVESTIGATE ONCE

01:01:59.115 --> 01:01:59.949
IT'S THE MATTERS BEEN BROUGHT TO

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:00.683
THEM.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.918
THAT SEEMS LIKE A HECK OF A LONG

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.286
TIME IF YOU'RE THE VICTIM OF THE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.388
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR IF YOU ARE

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:09.892
THE ACCUSED THREE YEARS -- YOU

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:10.960
KNOW WAS THE VICTIM LET'S SAY

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.695
IT'S AN ACCURATE IT'S INACCURATE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.796
ALLEGATIONS.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.298
DOES THE VICTIM THEN HAVE TO

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.133
SPEND THREE YEARS WITH YOU IN IT

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.701
AT WORK OR IF IT ISN'T AN

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.503
ACCURATE ONE DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.971
THREE YEARS FOR YOUR VINDICATION

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.673
A WHITE THE PURPOSE.

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.342
OF THAT EXCEPTION.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.478
IS BECAUSE WE WHAT WE ARE

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.879
LEARNING IS.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:32.115
THERE IS A RELUCTANCE OF PEOPLE

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.950
TO COME FORWARD OVER TIME YOU

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:37.053

AND BEHOLD MAYBE TO RETURN ON

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.355
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT IS

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.858

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.059
TIME THAT THE THAT BEARD ADAM

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.397
THREE YEARS FROM THE TIME THAT

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:51.000

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.508
THAT INFORMATION.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:02:59.142
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.309
RELUCTANCE TO COME FORWARD IF

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:00.943

SERIOUS ABOUT.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.315
EXTRACTING THIS FROM THE

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.817
WORKPLACE TO GIVE THREE YEARS

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.118

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:22.692
A AN AWFULLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:23.426
PAUL KIRBY HAVE CORRECTIONAL

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:25.428
SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION UP MA'AM

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.295
WHAT HAPPENS IN IF IT'S A SEXUAL

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:27.263
HARASSMENT CASE YOUR CONCERN IS

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.864
TO HAVING THE VICTIM STILL BE IN.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.033
CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE SUSPECT

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.269
OF THE HARASSMENT OF BEHAVIOR

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.637
ONCE IT'S DISCOVERED ON THE

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.239
FIRST TIME THAT PERSON WILL BE

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.273
MOVED TO HIT THAT THAT'S A

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.375
NORMAL PROCESS THEY WILL MOVE

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:40.076
THEM OUT.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.078
SO THE FACT THAT IT TAKES LONGER

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.347
TO INVESTIGATE THESE TYPES OF

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:45.848
CASES BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.750
ON REPORTING AND AND RELUCTANCE

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.352

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.598
I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.033
I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.735
THAT THIS IS A QUESTION THAT

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:08.170
SHOULD BE LOOKED AT FURTHER.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.372
AND WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE THAT

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.707
THE ALLEGED VICTIM IS THEN

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.342

ACTUALLY.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.478
THERE REMOVED FROM BUT BECAUSE

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:18.481
THE THE PERSON THE PERPETRATOR

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.783

THAT HAVE TO COME TO A

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.562
RELATIVELY QUICKER DETERMINATION --

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.964
BUT THE POINT THAT I WANT TO

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.432
MAKE HERE AT THE DIS TODAY.

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:45.334

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ONE

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:10.993

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.303
FAIR FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND OFFER

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.804
THE EMPLOYER BETTER CHANCE TO

PROBLEM IN OUR MIND WITH THE

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.313
LOCAL OPTION TO DO THAT AND

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.481
SWITCHING EVERYBODY OVER RATHER

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:33.782
THAN SIMPLY PROVIDING MORE

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.484
INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE DURING

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.319
THE EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION WHICH

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.987
IS REQUIRED NOW -- WOULD SEEM

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:40.622
LIKE AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION IF

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:41.923
WE WANT TO CLARIFY FOR WORKERS

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.492
WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE.

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.526
IN THEIR LOCAL COLLECTIVE

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.528
BARGAINING AGREEMENT THANK YOU

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:49.765

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:50.932
WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.534
BOARDS ASSOCIATION OUT WE DON'T

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.869
HAVE AN ISSUE WHETHER SIX MONTHS

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:54.636
OR TWELVE MONTHS AS OUR

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.071
CONVERSATIONS WE BELIEVE SHOULD

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.206
BE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WHAT I

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.875
DO WANNA AND WE REFERENCE IN OUR

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.676
LETTER IS THAT THERE IS A?

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.944
A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.679
MERIT NOT MERIT DISTRICTS -- AYE

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.648
AYE IF YOU LOOK AT THESE ARE THE

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:07.582
STATUTES.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.818
COVERING MERIT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.153
IT'S TWENTY FIVE PAGES LONG IT

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.821
CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.290
SUPPORTS THE REASON WHY YOU GO

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.191
TO SIX MONTHS THAT DOESN'T EXIST

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.526
IN A NON MERS SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.027
FOR EXAMPLE HE WOULD HAVE TO

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.362
HAVE A PERSONAL COMMISSION THAT

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.763
STRICTLY FOCUSED ON OVERSEEING

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:25.267
EVALUATING TESTING -- MERITS

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.369
THAT COST FIVE EMPLOYEES AT AND

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.336
YOU GO THROUGH A WITTY --

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.405
WIGGLING OUT OF QUALIFIED

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.307
APPLICANTS IN ADVANCE OF EVEN

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.809
HIRING SO YOU'VE ALREADY KIND OF

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.811
TAKING CARE OF SOME OF THE RISK

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.245
IN ADVANCE OF EVEN HIRING.

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.413
WHEN AT SIX MONTHS AND

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.514
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IT'S

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:40.849
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.384
NOT LIKE TYPICAL TEACHERS AT

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.052
START IN AUGUST AND WORK THROUGH

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.220
A WHOLE CALENDAR SCHOOL YEAR?

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.988
THEY MAY START IN MAY THEY MIGHT

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.324
WORK MAY AND JUNE AND NOT WORK

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.526
JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER THAT

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:52.494
SIX MONTHS START FROM THE DATE

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.095
THE THING SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.663
HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:55.964
REALLY UNDERSTAND AND EVALUATE

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.032
EMPLOYEE.

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.366
SO THAT SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE TO

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.368
MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:01.002
THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THEIR

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.304
EMPLOYMENT.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.805
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION IS A

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.273
SIMPLE WAY WORTH KEEPING ON OR

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.074
NOT.

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:06.875
AND I THINK A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.411
RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE IT

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:12.147
LABOR S. -- DISMISSAL PROCESS

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.849
PROBABLY UP TO MAYBE DISMISSED

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.684
THAT PERSON IF THEY DIDN'T SHOW

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.019
IMMEDIATE -- GRASP OF THE

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.387
ASSIGNMENT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:20.822
FAIRLY ANYBODY I'M NOT SURE IT'S

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:22.224
FAIR TO SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.391
BEEN RE HIGHER AND GO THROUGH

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:24.459
THE PROCESS.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:25.293
OR IS THAT A FAIR TO THE

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.561
EMPLOYEE THEY THINK IF THEY WERE

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.130
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.498
SO WE JUST THINK THAT THE COUNTY

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.032
YOUR CYCLE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.901
IS NOT A TYPICAL TWELVE MONTH

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.302
WORK ENVIRONMENT.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.304
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BASICALLY IN

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.072
EIGHT MONTHS NINE MONTHS SCHOOL

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.440
YEAR.

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:39.174
AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:39.841
THAT NEEDS BEGIN PRODUCT

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.243
INCINERATION COUPLED WITH THE

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.277
IDEA THAT.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.612
THERE ARE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.714
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE SIX MONTHS

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:51.353
WORK FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:52.754
HAVE CHOSE TO GO THAT PATH I

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:53.688
USED TO WORK FOR LOS ANGELES

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:54.256
UNIFIED THEY HAVE IN THEIR

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:54.656
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:55.223
BUT THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.258
PROCESS TO WEED OUT GOOD

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:56.925
APPLICANTS AND APPLICANTS BEFORE

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.593
THEY'RE EVEN HIRED SO YOU KNOW

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.427
YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.262
OFFICE CAN'T.

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.696
THAT DOESN'T EXIST WITHIN A NON

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:03.231
MERIT SCHOOL BASIS AND TO

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.566
SUGGEST THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.901
JUST SIX MONTHS AND TWELVE

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:06.968
MONTHS WITHOUT THE EXTRA

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:09.004
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.638
I THINK THIS DOES MORE HARM THAN

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:13.508
GOOD. FOR THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.576
