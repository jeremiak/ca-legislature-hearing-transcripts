IN SOMEWHERE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WHICH. I TO MY MIND OVER TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN ONE PERFORMING AGENCIES THAT WAY OVER STE AND WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT WORKFORCE. IS IN THAT BUT THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. AT FIVE I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE OVER THE COURSE OF THAT AND TWO SO THE BIT OF A DEBT TO ME. ERIN THAT'S SO WHY WERE HAPPY. BUT THIS TODAY IS TO NOW THIS REPORT TECHNICALLY ON THE IS. OF REAL ID. BUT ALSO TO YOU ARE WELCOME. CORD ONLY BEEN. BUT I THINK IS ABSENT FIVE. INFORMATION FOR ON THE PATH. I'M. WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM CARE TO TELL A CEO OF A- WARNING WAS GOING TO DISCUSS. THE VERY REAL. WE HAVE AN IMPACT FROM THE BILL I THE DEVIL. HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT- TOURISM THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE. FEDERAL REAL ID ACT WAS PASSED. SOME TIME AGO TWO FIVE DRIVER THEN I CAR I DID GET OURS NOW HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE EX TO BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OFFICIAL PER. WHAT KIND OF OFFICIAL PURPOSE TWELVE ACCESSING MOST FACILITIES WERE. IMPORTANT TO UGH UGH CONSUMERS BOARDING FEDERALLY REGULATED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND THAT BEGINS SO A ELEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW ON OCTOBER FIRST. AS OF AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN IN A MOTOR VEHICLES IS ASSESSED ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF. IN REAL LIFE THESE- UP. AND THAT NUMBER BECAUSE WE CAN COUNT THE PEOPLE HAVE COME THROUGH THE VARIOUS OFFICES BUT- IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT WE WILL NEED TO PROCESS AND ELEVEN MILLION BY THAT OCT. TWENTY AND MY UNDERSTAND. ESTIMATE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT UP OR IS IT MIGHT BE SO AND TODAY THE DEPARTMENT OF WHAT GOES HAS KEPT WAIT TIME- I SHOULD SAY IN RECENT WEEKS THE DEPARTMENT IS WAIT TIMES. OF MY- BY ADDING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. FIELD OFFICES YEAH AND BY MAKING THIS PROCESS. THEN OF REMAIN RELATIVELY STATIC AND AS THAT NUMBER ROOM INSTEAD THE NUMBER OF IDEAS THAT HAVE PROCESSED AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE DEADLINE. AND PROCESSING THE BEFORE THAT DEADLINE BECOMES MORE AND MORE PROBLEMATIC. SO IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT OTHER WILL CROSS. FORTY IS WANT TO NEED A REAL. TWENTY HOPEFULLY TODAY AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY REQUEST WILL HEAR WHAT THAT STEP. VEHICLE INTENDS TO TAKE. TO A KIND OF EXTREME WHAT IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN AND RECORD. I'M GOING TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUE HELLO AS REST. COME HERE ALL THE WAY THE BEAUTIFUL AND LET. THEM RIGHT THERE TO IT'S RAINING.

BLOOM WE PROVIDE IT FOR SEVEN HUNDRED. ALREADY BEEN. THEIR JOB OF JULY OF THIS YEAR AND IT WORKS I THINK THE SECOND PART OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. THE LOSS OF. OVER THE IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF. ONE OF THE ESTIMATES. THEY ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TRAVEL. COULD BE TURNED AWAY BY TSA CHECKPOINT ON THE FIRST DATE COSTING THE ENEMY FORTY THREE. CONTINUE WE'RE LOOKING AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN DOLLARS- DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO EVERYBODY IN THERE. ANOTHER. INTERESTING IS THAT OR HALF OF CALIFORNIA. DON'T EVEN KNOW. TO BE COMPLY AND TO BY OCTOBER OF NEXT YEAR US THERE'S LOTS OF WORK DONE ON PLAN. BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN COUNT. THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WI HELP CALIFORNIA BE IN COMPLIANCE SHOULD THE WE DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC. THERE WE HAVE OUR CALIFORNIANS COMPLAINTS. HAVING. SET UP IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT- MISTER BLOOM LOOKED ABOUT THAT- HAVING PROPER NUMBER OF STAFF TWO OF THE NEED PEOPLE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT WE WILL. AT TODAY'S HEARING AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK AND NOW WE'LL TURN TO. AND SINCE FOR YOU ASKED I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TO AN ASTORIA. IS THERE A LITTLE SKIN COLOR WE HAVE TO.

THEY'RE THE SAME. OKAY SO THIS ONE BETTER MY TRAVEL YEAH. TOM C. HORTON ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES AS- IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS. YOU MIGHT HEAR. SERVICES THEY SHOULD EXPECT US. THIS MY LONG TERM VISION FOR THE DMV PHASER CURRENT CRISIS AS SHORTFALLS IN. WE DO ESTIMATED AT. WE WILL CLOSE. WE DO AGREE THAT THE OTHER SOMEWHERE AROUND SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT SHOULD HAVE A REAL DEBATE. WE ARE ABOUT SIX NINE. IN THAT IN THAT PROCESS TODAY. AND IF WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER FOUR THOUSAND OR ISSUE WE PER MONTH IS A KEY THE ISSUANCE CONTINUE TO CORPUS NEEDS OF THE TOTAL POPULATION SO MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING A REAL ID BUT STILL. CHALLENGE FOR ME AWARENESS AND- ACTION TALK ABOUT I'M SURE DURING OUR DISCUSSION THANK. IN ORDER INCREASE THE RELY THE- SAYS THERE'S A NUMBER. OFFICE HOURS ARE MAKING SURE THEY'RE OPEN THEIR THEIR. SHE CAN'T TO MAKE OUR WAY OF THE NEED RELY THE- ACTION- CAM AWARENESS REALLY CAMPAIGNS ARE VERY SPECIFIC DO SOMETHING NOW WE WANT TO SPECIFIC OR WE CAN BE. THE TAKEN ACTION TODAY THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THREE OR FOUR. SO WE CAN TRY TO TRY PEOPLE INTO. NUMBER DRIVE THE DRIVE OF THE OFFICIAL OF THE PROCESS HAVING SOME. FIELD OFFICES AND WATCH RELATED TAXES HAPPEN. AND I WOULD JUST SAY IS WASTED TIME SOCIETAL TIME ECONOMIC TIME PEOPLE WATCHING US TYPE ENGINE SOME SO WE'VE MADE SOME SEE. CLIENT THE. TWENTY MINUTES INTO IN OUR PILOT FACILITY HELP 265% REDUCTION. I'M NOT A ROLLOUT STABLE BUILD. MEET TIME IMPROVES WAIT TIME WHEN HE. THE JUST NEED AS WE TRY TO PULL THEM FORTY. WE'RE DOING THINGS OUT TRYING TO SHIFT TRACK. TO ALTERNATE SO WE TALK ABOUT THOSE WE HAVE AN UNDER UTILIZED. BUSINESS PARTNERS ARE TRYING. TO CHIEF TRAFFIC TO THOSE TO ME. THE SPACE IS AVAILABLE WELL IN THE IN THE DMV. TRANSPARENT COMEDIES STRATEGIES THAT WERE REALLY DRIVE PEOPLE INTO THE WINDOW MAKES ME PEOPLE WHO. YOU IN I GUESS FOR ADDITIONAL ESTUDIANTE TO THE WEAPONS ON AS WE WOULD ALL BE. THOSE CHANNELS OF IT CAN BE SURE THAT HE WOULD BE SER BY ANY OTHER BUSINESS OTHER THAN PERHAPS THE STATE. WHEN IT'S- FRESH AND PRESSED. QUESTION SO THERE'S A HECK OF A LOT OF TIME TO WRITE UP A TO THE DEMAND THE DO YOU HAVE A PROJECTION OF HOW MANY. SERVER FOR OVER THE COMING MONTHS SLIPPED. WHAT IT FOR- BEING ABLE TO WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT- HOW LONG DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE WAIT TIMES TO BE ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE TO DROP DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO NECESSARILY INCREASE BECAUSE NGUYEN IF I UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS. CORRECTLY GIVEN THE NUMBER OF MONTHS AND THE NUMBER OF. PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT TO BE. PRESUMABLY TO BE SERVED- WERE GONNA BE FACING AT LEAST A MINIMUM- DOUBLING OF THE- PEOPLE IN THE TO BE SERVED STATEWIDE. RIGHT ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK HE- THE CHANCE RESUME IT'S A VERY BASIC MATH PROBLEM I THINK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AS WE REDUCE THE CYCLE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION SO THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES OUT THE WINDOW TO COMPLETE A TRANSIT AS I MENTIONED WITH. THE COMING WITH US PASSPORT TODAY. WE'VE MADE. THIS TO. TIME FROM TWENTY EIGHT. TO TEN MINUTES. IF OUR RESIDENTS CAME OVER THE U. S. PASSPORT. ALWAYS WHICH IS COURSE NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT THAT'S RIGHT NOW 50% OF PEOPLE TEND 2% WITH US PASSPORT. AND PEOPLE CAME IN AN ORDERLY FASHION WHICH PEOPLE HUMAN NATURE TELLS US NOT BEHAVE ORDERLY. THAT WE WOULD CREATE ENOUGH CAPACITY WITH THE READ THAT YOU. GIVEN THE DMV PARTY THE BUDGETING PROCESS IS. I'M IS WHERE WE. AND AN ARTIFACT SO WE NEED A TO BEGIN DRIVE WHERE. SHE CROSSED MALL JUST. COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE DEMOCRATS X. OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. MESSAGE SENT TO THE COMMUNITY. ACTION AND WE WANT TO FILL SOME OF THE CAPACITY THAT WE'VE OPENED UP BY REDUCING THE TRANSACTION CYCLE TIME. BECAUSE NOW WE'VE CREATED SOME SPACE WHY THE M. THE WAIT TIMES ARE COMING DOWN HAS BEEN CREATED. LESS RESISTANCE LESS FRICTION THE WINDOW NOW WE NEED TO SERVE WE FEEL SOME OF THAT NOT NOT TO MAKE WAIT TIMES GO BEYOND LEVELS WE HAVE SOME HAS BEEN ADDED TO FILL SOME ADDITIONAL TRANSACTION. BROADLY SPEAKING AT ME WE BELIEVE THAT AS YOU TO REFINE THAT PROCESS CAN TWENTY EIGHT DEGREE ANGLE LOWER THAN THAT IS STILL MEET. A DHL REQUIREMENTS AND STILL MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS TO OUR RESIDENTS BUT- IS IT WE'RE GONNA NEED. THE MORE PEOPLE INTO THE YES WE CAN ACTUALLY. TRIED IT SOON THAT ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION THE OCTOBER. NOW WE DO NOTHING ELSE EXISTING WHAT WILL STILL REQUIRE RETIRE PROBABLY. FOUR MILLION AT FOUR HUNDRED. THOUSAND UNITS. THAT STILL LEAVES A GAP OF EVERYBODY. FIVE TO SIX PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT. AS WE GET CLOSER THE DEADLINE PEOPLE THAT ARE A LOT OF PLANNERS ARE STILL GOING TO SHOW UP. WE WILL CREDIT PASSAGE OF THE. POTENTIAL NOT BEATING THAT. GO LASSEN. TALKING ABOUT. ERNEST K. CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE FULLY AND. COMMERCIALS WHERE THEY WERE IN A WHERE THE PLAYING AND- WITH THE IT IS A FOR THOSE. OVERALL IT'S SOMEWHERE NORTH. MARCH FOURTH PROMOTED. WE ALSO DO THINGS ARE WHAT WE DESIGN WHICH IS. SOMEONE THOUGHT. YOUR COST. OF OUR PART WEB REDESIGN. SO WHERE YOU STICK I MEAN TO GIVE. ADDED TO PACIFIC COMMUNITY TARTAN. THE TEST IN THE IN BAKERSFIELD IN OUR ROLLING OUT TO THESE SMALL A SMALL. MARKETS WITHIN WITHIN. THE STATE WERE CAMPAIGNS ARE YOU SEE BILLBOARDS RADIO ADS AS THE TV ADS YOU'LL SEE SOCIAL MEDIA OUT SO WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR REAL IDEAL. LITTLE TALK ABOUT IT CALIFORNIA. OUR WERE YOU PHYSICALLY ARE AND BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE APPROPRIATE ADD TO USE A WE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE TRYING TO GET INTO CAN DRIVE AWARENESS AND SECONDARY TO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GONNA TRY BACK DRIVE ACTION THE ONE. GOOD BUT ACTION IS WE REALLY WANT PEOPLE AND NOT HAVE TO MEET YOU JUST HOW WE OPERATE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE THESE THINGS THAT. GREAT EMPLOYMENT BEFORE THEY COME IN. BUT WE HAVE CAPACITY THE OFFICE AND DAILY BASIS WE WANT ACTUAL DRIVE. YOU CAN MAKE A POINT. WE AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THE NEXT REPUBLICAN ME. ROBIN ONLY SO WE'LL MOVE THE OBSTACLE WELL I GOT ON A PLANE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS WE DON'T WANT. TO GO. ON THE TIME YOU WANT TO COME TO THE LEFT ON THE TIME OF. IF YOU THINK REAL. THE OFFICE INTO A WE'RE GONNA RUN AND TEST NUMBER OF THESE HYPOTHESES HE CAN MAYBE WILL DRIVE THEM TO AND THEN PRESENT HIM WITH AN ACTION THEY CAN TAKE RIGHT NOW HOW HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THE- AFFAIRS OUTREACH EFFORT. SOME OF THE COMMISSION SOLDIERS WERE REALLY LOOK AROUND WE SEEN AN UPTICK IN TERMS OF WHATEVER THE- IDEALLY. THIS IS A I MEAN IN TWO PARTICULAR SITE YOUR PARTICULAR MICROSITE SEEN SUBSTANTIAL OPTICS IN IN PEOPLE'S AGAIN AWARENESS OF PROP PROSPER. EASY ONLINE FORMS WHICH ARE DRIVING TO THAT ARE SPECIFIC SITE GET TO WITH. THIS SPECIFIC YOUR- IN THE AD CAMPAIGN SHE MEASURE. ON TOP OF THAT WORST TEMPS. WELL I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT HOW PREPARED WHERE THEY DID THE USE THAT HOW DID THEY RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE OF TO. HOW ARE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THE MESSAGES. NEEDED TO IN THAT MESS YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THE DATA THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS I AM I NEED. RARELY SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING A FEW TO BE HONEST BUT I THINK WE ARE WE ARE LET'S JUST WE. BUT I THINK THIS IS IT'S A- IT'S A MATTER CAST AND- YOU BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING DATA THE DATA- WE STILL NEED TO MAKE IT SAYS MORE DETERMINISTIC BETWEEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE FACT. FACT FOR ME WOULD BE DID IT COME INTO THE OFFICE WHERE THE REPAIRED. WERE THEY ABLE TO DO THAT ONCE. SHIFTING GEARS SELF FOR A MOMENT. YOU FOR A. SO FAR FROM MY CHIN FROM. TRISH FUNDED FOR A. THE INCREASE AND THE HOW ARE THE HIRING EFFORTS GO AT. ARE YOU GONNA BE RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE. HE SAID LOOK AT THE BOTH. BUDGET PROCESSES. WHATEVER THE OFFICIAL STATE BUDGET STILL SOME NEW DIVING BUDGET CHANGE PROS ABUSING. WE LOOK AT BOTH OF THE BUT- THE- BEEN POVERTY THAT THE DMV I THINK WERE THE NUMBER I SAW JUST IMPROPER FOR THE CHANGE. FRONTLINE IN THE POP PERSONNEL AND SO ON SO I THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE IN TERMS OF RESOURCE WE DO HAVE SOME ATTRITION IF YOU HAD TO THAT. WHICH IS NORMAL AND WERE. RETAIL TOO MANY EXPERT COMPETING WITH OTHER. WAGES ARE. ONLY LOW- COMPARE EXITING THE JOB SO I THINK THE TEAM'S PRETTY GOOD JOB MY JOB IS TO HELP. BEING ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT SO THAT WE TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE- THE VERY DIFFICULT DRUDGERY THE VERY ADMINISTRATIVE TO THE TASK. AND IF WE COULD SIMPLIFY THAT SO THEY COULD REDUCE COMPLEX. I THINK OUR- TEMPLATE BE MORE SATISFIED IN THE JOB STILL IT'S AS A RETAIL JOB. TEXAS AS SATISFIES A CAN BE BUT IF WE TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT. ARE REALLY SORT OF SACRAMENTO MANDATE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT'S REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE CAN. THEIR EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS I THINK WE WILL IMPROVE. MORALE TWELVE AND ALSO GIVEN THE FIELD. HE HAD THE ABILITY TO. DO I NEED TO GET. MANAGED BY SACRAMENTO BUT THE TO ENABLE THEM TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT. ANY THE WAY. IN THE DMV SENDS OUT. PAPERWORK TO END OF IT THIS. IS THERE INCLUDE. FOR THANK URGING PEOPLE TO GET THEIR REPLY DE TAKING CARE OF THAT PROVIDE A CHECKLIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF. ONE OF THE CALENDAR HERE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A- NORMAL VISITS TO THE DMV. AND IT'S FREE. TO LET YOU HAVE TO COME AND YOU. DO IT ONLINE- TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE TO BRING IN SPECIFIC WORK WITH. HOW ARE YOU MISSING THAT ISSUE YES WE TRY TO. INSERTED INTO THE ENVELOPE SO THINGS WERE SENATOR HOUSE WE USE THE REAL ESTATE ON THE ENVELOPE ITSELF PUTTING COLOR. AS A RECENT FELIDAE CONVERT MYSELF THE MESSAGES WERE. WELL YOU CAN GET THIS OR THAT AND WE'VE CHANGED OUR BY FROM WELL ALL TO SAY NO WE WANT TO DO THIS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED. TO RELY THE- TO GET A FEDERAL. WE WANT OUR BIAS IN THEIR PRICE TO BE IF YOU'RE QUALIFIED FOR. I REALLY DO YOU SHOULD BE THE COST OF. LEVEL PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SAME SO WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE INTO THAT SO WE'VE CHANGED OUR EVEN OUR MESSAGING WE PRINT ON ENVELOPES WITH THE WITH THE THINGS WE STOP IN THE OFFICE AS WELL AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR MICROSITE U. R. L. THAT'S THAT'S EMBEDDED IN EACH ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SO WHAT. THOSE HAVE GONE OUT TEAM THE PATIENT AND IN ACTION. GO UP SUBSTANTIALLY. IT HAS A AS A CHECKLIST THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU DO IN AND IT REALLY START WITH DO YOU NEED A REAL ID AND WALKS YOU THROUGH ALL THE STEPS THE YOUNG THE WHAT GOT ME TO BE IN CHANGES WERE WERE MAKING SORT OF AS WE SPEAK IT'LL HOPEFULLY BE LAUNCHING THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'RE GONNA MOVE FROM A PASSIVE YOU NEED A RELAY THE MESSAGE TO A YOU NEED A REAL IDE AS AMERICAN ASK YOU IS A YOU NEED TO REALIZE THE MEDIA BY THE STATE HERE ARE THE STEPS. AND IF YOU CONNECT. WITH THE- ARE YOU READY. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TEST A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE PEOPLE. TO ACTION. VERSUS JUST AWARENESS AND WE THINK THE ACTION. AND AWARENESS. GO HAND IN HAND IF WE CAN DRIVE THAT AWARENESS AND ACTION TOGETHER. WE CAN DRIVE PEOPLE INTO THE CURRENT PERIOD. AS OPPOSED TO. SEPTEMBER THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE RIGHT APPROACH. TO MAYBE. I THINK CREATING A SENSE OF. SEE IS- AT THIS POINT TIME ANYWAY. YES IT'S GOING TO BE. IMPORTANT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS A ONE. PIECE TENSION ADJUSTMENTS RISES TO SECURITY CARD. BE ABLE TO MY MIND AND I REMARKED CONNELLY I KEPT IT ALL THESE YEARS BECAUSE YOU ARE RARELY CALLED UPON TO CHOSE PTOSIS THE CARD. ALSO MANY PEOPLE HAVE. NOW CHANGED THEIR NAMES. I MEAN I WAS. MY LOTTERY SO I KNOW PEOPLE WHO. MORE THAN ONCE OVER THE COURSE OF FOR. HERE'S WHERE THEY WERE MARRIED. PEOPLE CHANGED NAMES JUST BECAUSE- NAME. HAVE A THE REASON FOR DOING THAT. AND THEN THAT DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE SERVICES TO THE SOCIAL SIX THE CARD. HI HOW YOU RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. THEY DON'T ALL COME TO YOUR DESK BUT- THE GENERAL IS OTHERS. MONTEL THINGS YOU PRESENT FOR THIS THIRTY ADMINISTRATION QUALIFICATION IT JUST HAS TO BE YOUR FULL NINETY TO SUCH PRETTY NUMBER SO IT WHETHER IT'S THE STREET CAR WHETHER IT'S- A PASTE UP. A FULL NINE DIGITS WHAT. ID JUST. AND BY. BY BY THEIR INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL LAW IT'S A- I HAVE ONE OF THOSE THINGS NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER AND OVER A LIFE. EMPIRE MORE THINGS WE SHOULD. MAYBE FOR OTHER DAY DISCUSSION BUT YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE A FULL SOCIAL ON BASED ABROAD. CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE SECURE I THINK THERE'S AVENUES THAT PEOPLE CAN ALTERNATE IS THAT ARE. REALLY YEAH COMMON THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IF THE P. BEGINNING OF THAT. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR BECAUSE YOU RAISE ANOTHER ISSUE AND THAT IS THE WORLD TURNED ABOUT. PERSONAL DATA SECURITY THIS IS THE NUMBER IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE- COLLECTIVELY BELIEVE WE SHOULDN'T BE SHARE WITH ANYBODY RIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE. A STATE ASK FOR THAT INFORMATION. TO DOING THAT. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO OVERCOME. IS SO IS THE DMV KEEPING TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF END OF IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REACH DOES IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER. A SET OF. MISSION PAPERS ANY VERY. WE ARE. SYRIAN WHERE ARE I DO NOT KEEPING TRACK OF MULTIPLE VISITS FULL ISSUES THANK YOU. WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT. THIS CALL IS NOT MUCH LAST. YOU A CALL THEN YOU'RE CALLING AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY BY AND LARGE WE SAMPLE. PEOPLE COME IN THERE SOME DATA SOME SIX THE SYSTEM THAT'LL HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WE JUST WANT TO WE WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VISITS BECAUSE I NUMBER OF IT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF BUDGET. TWENTY MINUTES WOULD TAKE TWENTY MINUTES FIRST TIME A- SECOND TIME. SO WE- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT IN TERMS OF. THE FOR THE FIRST STOP INTO THE DMV. CHECKING YOUR DOCTOR THE TRIAGE DESK. YOU HAVE. TRANSACTION OUR MESSAGING IS A VERY FOCUS ON GETTING THAT INFORMATION IN YOUR HANDS I WOULD HAVE TO BRING IN WORLD. ROLL OUT SOME ANOTHER THIS CAN HELP US NOW. MANY OF THOSE THINGS.

SOMEBODY WHO HAS STATION. DIEM TO HELP LEGISLATURE DEAL WITH THIS A SIMILAR- YES THE CALIFORNIA IS AN OPTIONAL STATE OF THE LOS UP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN OPT IN TO A REAL ID OR OPT OUT AND HAVE A CAR THAT'S NOT FEDERALLY COMPLIANT.

IT'S ALL MUSIC- DOWN TO TALK ABOUT CRITICISMS BECAUSE THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED ONE OR TWO WERE JUST A FEW. UNFORTUNATELY GOT TIRED TO PART OF THE BECAME A CULTURE OF THE- SO THAT I SEE THAT AS A CHALLENGE AND I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN. GREAT EFFORTS MADE TO. MAKE THINGS BETTER AND SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT. VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THE TRAINING OF THE STAFF. ON THE CHANGE OF THE CULTURE OF THE DMV. WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN WHAT'S YOUR VISION AND HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE. COUPLE QUESTION SO.

AND I WAS IN IN THE IN THE OC OUT AS WELL I READ THAT DURING MY PROCESS I WAS WHEN THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS LIKE IT LEARN ABOUT THE V. IN AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S BEEN SIX CHARGES UP. TO YOU TO CHANGE HOW WE MAKE. AND I GIPSON SAMPLE AWHILE AGO. FIELD OPERATIONS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOWARD HUGHES THE CYCLE. INTERESTING SACRAMENTO THINK ABOUT THINGS SHOULD BE IN HE'LL BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF THE EMPLOYEE AND HOW THAT. I THINK. IN THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT THIS OP WITH THE CLUB CREST. THOSE DECISION RIGHT DOING THE WORK. CONSULT WITH OTHER FOLLOWING THE LAW. WITH THAT MOVEMENT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL MOVE IN IN THE IN THE TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS THE TRANSACTION BECAUSE OPERATIONS TEAM HAD A IF THE WELL YOU KNOW THAT. THEY WERE IN THAT. THEY ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT DO YOU DO IT. REALLY DID WHAT THE MODEL SENSITIVE. IT IS LIKE THAT THE MOVE. KIND OF A VERY RISK AVERSE CULTURE SACRAMENTO STREET CULTURE TOO. BY MAKING DECISIONS WE NEED AIRPORT AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE A LOT DIRECTION WE'RE TRYING TO GO BUT IF YOU IN THAT. IS A LOOK ON TUESDAY BETWEEN THESE TWO. YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH YOU NEED. DROUGHT WHAT'S GOING TO WORK IN. ACROSS THE STATE.

THANKS THIS IS THE. FOR YEARS AND THAT'S KEEP DOING WHAT HE SAID THEY WERE ACTING STE WHICH IS HOW WE GOT THIS TWENTY MINUTE TESTING TIME FOR REAL. ANOTHER GOOD IDEA. AFTER WE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING SO WE NEED TO REALLY KIND OF UNWIND AND THAT'S REALLY I WANT MY TEAM TO BE ABLE TO THINK ON THEIR OWN TO PRESENT THEIR ARGUMENTS. HOW WE SHOULD DO WHATEVER ENTITIES. ITS YEAH THEY- YOUR. HE IS REALLY GOOD CALLS ON THIS BUT. THE CULTURE IS PULLING IT ACTION NO MATTER MY NEW LEADERSHIP AND OTHER CULTURES GOING TO KILL US WE'VE GOT TO GET. THE EXISTING WORK OUT WHERE WE GO THROUGH DECISION MAKING DECISION RIGHTS OWNERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY THE BE AND HOW WE USED. IN A MODERN ENTER. KEEP IN MIND THAT OUT LEAVE THE OTHER NIGHT AND WE. THE TOP FROM THE TOP WE HAVE ALL THE- IN FRONT OF US BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE WALK INTO. THE WE- BUT CAN NUMBER THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL. AWARE OF THE REAL WORLD WORKS AND ONE PART OF A STRAIGHT EDGE WITHOUT STATUTES BUT VISIT CULTURE RATE UNTIL THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM IN MARIN SAGE THE DMV AND WHAT WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THE STATE WHAT'S EXPECTED MOTION FOR THE FROM FROM THE CUSTOMERS. HE TO THAT PERSON SITTING ACROSS FROM THEM AT THE COUNTER IS THEIR NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND THEIR RELATIVE. AND HAS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT TWENTY MINUTES OF THEM SITTING THERE IS TWENTY MINUTES ARE NOT SPENT AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN THEY'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY MEMBER NOT WORKING.

NO IT THREE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE BOOKING PAST OCTOBER FIRST EXCEPT FOR A AMERICAN AIRLINES BUT AT LEAST THREE LIKE TO CARE ABOUT CARE AT THIS POINT. NOT REGULAR AID VISINE OR PUTTING NOT FORWARD AROUND THEIR WEB. CHECK AT THE AT. EIGHT SO THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR US. YOU KNOW THE THING THAT JUST CAME TO MIND I'M IS THAT PERHAPS THE DMV NEEDS TO HAVE A WINDOW AT THE AIRPORT. BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE. FIRST THEY CAN CALL THEIR AND GET THE TEMPORARY ID. I. TSA PRECHECK SOME OF. METHODS OF THE SHOW COMPLIANCE OR TO COMPLIANCE- SO YOUR IDEAS. IT MEANT THAT WAS NOTED I THINK IS THE MOST.

IN MY DISTRICT- ENCOMPASSES THE ON THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS HOLLYWOOD SO MANY OTHER ICONIC PLACES SAID- IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE OF. ALL DROP IN. AND NOT IN TOURISM THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT WILL UP THE POTENTIAL REASON. POTENTIALLY RESOUND FOR QUITE. SO AGAIN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT THE- FOR KING CUT OUT WITH YOU. **** BUT GOING FORWARD. ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUR OUTRAGE ON THIS ISSUE PLEASE FEEL FREE ONE WITH MYSELF AND THE MEMBERS.

THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND FREEDOM OF TRAVEL. AS OUR IN OUR WRITTEN TWENTY WOULD HAVE JUST GIVEN TO THE EIGHT AND HAD PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY IN ADVANCE I HOPE. HE HAS. ANY OF THE COSTS. NATION OF THE LIP. CALIFORNIA-DRIVERS-PAY-UNDERFUNDED-STATE-PATROL-PENSION. REAL THE DEBATE AS WE WILL BE REQUIRED IF CALIFORNIA. I. HOPE YOU WILL DMV ABOUT THEIR PLANS TEND. THE STATION IN THE SPECS NATIONAL ID. SECOND THE DMB. FOR IMPLEMENTATION CLAIMS. ABOUT WHAT I DO REQUIRED BY THE DIRECT DID BOTH WHAT THE STATE HAS TED IN COURTING. THE TSA RECORDS RELEASED IN RESPONSE FRIEDMAN VINCE MAC REQUESTS WHAT MADE WAS SURPRISED GIVEN THE VEHEMENCE WITH WHICH HAVE CLAIMED OTHERWISE. BUT IN FACT. HAS BEEN NO LAW OR REGULATION REQUIRES TRAVELERS TO SHOW. ANY ID. AND THE RECORDS WE HAVE OBTAINED LOGS AND KELLY. THAT FROM THE TSA. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHY WOULD I EVERY NIGHT WE DID DISCUSS THOSE IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU'D LIKE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THE FACE OF WHAT IS IN ITS ESSENCE A ROLL THREAT TO RESTRICT OF CALIFORNIANS TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND PARTICULARLY UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. THE DMB HAS CHOSEN TO BUDGET ONLY FOR HOW TO CAPITULATE AND EVEN HOW TO COLLABORATE IN THAT ATTACK ON CALIFORNIANS RIGHTS RATHER THAN AS OUR STATE HAS DONE IN OTHER AREAS. PREPARING PLANNING AND BUDGETING TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF ANY CALIFORNIANS WHOSE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL BY COMMON CARRIER IS DENIED OR INFRINGED BY FEDERAL ACTION. WE URGE YOU TO BEGIN THE PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS AND TO SCHEDULE FURTHER HEARINGS ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO DEFEND RIGHTS IT'S RESIDENTS AGAINST THIS FEDERAL ATTACK ON THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS QUESTION FOR DETAIL ANY OF YOU OR YOUR STAFF OR AT A FUTURE HEARING. YOU HAVE SAID AND I AGREE THE TURNING PEOPLE AWAY AT CHECK POINTS ON IS SIMPLY WRONG. AND YOU ALSO SPOKEN MODERNIZING THE REPLY IDEA. BEST WAY TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED IS TO WORK WITH YOUR FEDERAL LEGISLATURES ONE. AMENDMENT. THE REALIZE ACT WHICH IS ITS REPEAL. WHAT ARE THE GOVERNMENT RESULT. THE TWO ACTORS RIGHTS BACK AT POINTS WE'LL LIKE DEPEND SIGNIFICANT. IN WATER THE DHS SO BEAR WITH THE STATE. IS FULLY PREPARED TO DEFEND THE RIGHT CALIFORNIA.
