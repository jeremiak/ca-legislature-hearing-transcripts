NOW UP TO THE STATES TO ACT.

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.258
THE CORE PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.993
THE NEUTRALITY IS THAT INTERNET

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.695

MEDIA HE'D OR FAIL.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.873
WITHOUT CLEAR PROTECTIONS THE

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.209
INTERNET IS A DRAMATIC RISK OF

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.978

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.820
IT'LL BE CHANGED TO A PLACE

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:51.854

AND WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT NET

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:10.510
NEUTRALITY GIVEN THE ACTION THAT

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:12.879
WAS TAKEN BY THE FCC IN DECEMBER

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:15.482
OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHERE THEY

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:18.819
MOVED TO REPLACE THE TWENTY

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:20.354
FIFTEEN FCC ORDER.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.855
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AT

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:22.889
FIRST OF ALL.

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.391
ALL OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:25.892
ADHERE TO THE POLICIES AND THE

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:28.028
PRINCIPLES OF AN OPEN INTERNET.

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.763
BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.999
THAT WE ARE NOT WITHOUT

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:34.601
REGULATORY STRUCTURE AT THIS

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.570
POINT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.338
CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT GOVERNS

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:40.574
OUR ACTIVITIES ON THE INTERNET.

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:43.510
IS THE SAME REGULATORY STRUCTURE

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:44.811
THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE AND WHY

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:47.347
THAN PLACE UP UNTIL.

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:47.881
TWENTY FIFTEEN IT IS THE

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.884
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WE

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.954
BROWN AND THRIVE AND BECOME THE

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:56.256
TOOL THAT WE KNOW IT TO BE TODAY.

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:59.760
SO WE DON'T SEE A NEED TO HAVE

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.962
STATES IMPOSING ADDITIONAL

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.797
REGULATION HERE ON A SERVICES

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.203
SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY ONE SET OF

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:12.305
REGULATIONS AND THE FRAMEWORK.

01:45:12.372 --> 01:45:13.707
THAT IS IN FACT CURRENTLY IN

01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:15.642
PLACE WE BELIEVE THE STATE'S ARE

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:18.145
PREEMPTED IN THIS SPACE THERE

01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:19.880
WILL LIKELY RESULT IN.

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:22.449
SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION AND THAT

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:24.217
TOO WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.953
OPERATIONS OF OUR INTERNET IN

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.156
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.891
THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED.

01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.793
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:35.595
WRITTEN THE BILL WOULD ALLOW NOT

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.164

ALL OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS HAVE

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:49.543
THE ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.278
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THESE

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:53.313

ACCESS SERVICE FROM THEM BUT

01:51:23.309 --> 01:51:24.277

AS WRITTEN SET FORTH A

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:35.188
SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:35.822
SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:38.058
I WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL FOR

01:51:38.124 --> 01:51:38.792
HIGHEST PEATED ENGAGE IN

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.894

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:49.302
THE FCC IN CONTRAST EXPRESSLY

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.904
DECLINED TO ADOPT SUCH ARBITRARY

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.972
REQUIREMENT IN FACT CHAIRMAN

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:54.641
WHEELERS ORDER I SAID OVER AND

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:55.708
OVER AGAIN THAT WOULD NOT ADOPT

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:57.911
THAT IT'S HAD A PARAGRAPH ONE

01:51:57.977 --> 01:51:58.445
NINETY FIVE SAYING THAT WE

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:00.080
CONCLUDE THAT APPLICATION OF OUR

01:52:00.146 --> 01:52:00.713
RULES HERE.

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:03.049
I WOULD BE WOOD IS NOT WARRANTED

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:04.350
WITH RESPECT INTERNET TRAFFIC

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:06.086
CHANGED ITS OTHER PARAGRAPH TWO

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:07.587
OH TWO SAYING IT'S NOT

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:08.555
APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY TO

01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:09.956
SUBJECT ARRANGEMENTS FOR IN THAT

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:11.257
TRAFFIC IT CHANGED. TO THE OPEN

01:52:11.324 --> 01:52:12.625
INTERNET RULES IT SENATOR

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.227
PARAGRAPH TO A SIX AGAIN TO BE

01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:15.495
CLEAR WE ARE NOT APPLYING THE

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:17.464
OPEN INTERNET RULES WE DOT TODAY

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:19.132
TO INTERNET TRAFFIC EXCHANGE.

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.100
SO THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:21.768
BETWEEN A REGIME IN WHICH THE

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:22.602
REGULATOR MERELY ASSERT ITS

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:25.338
AUTHORITY AS THE FCC DIDN'T

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:26.172
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ONE THAT

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:28.007
ESTABLISHES SUBSTANTIVE RULES

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:28.775
THAT THE FCC.

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:30.777
I IN FACT NEVER EXERCISED IN THE

01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:33.113
TWO YEARS DURING WHICH THAT

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:33.613
ORDER WHAT WAS IN EFFECT

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:33.913
[inaudible]

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.315
I'M.

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:36.382
I'VE ALSO SEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:37.584
ON THIS POINT THAT THE ACT THAT

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:39.185
THE FCC WAS GOING TO REVIEW

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:40.587
EVERY INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:41.221
CASE BY CASE.

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:43.723
THAT'S JUST NOT SO HOT WHAT IT

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:44.624
SAID IT WAS A MEAT WOULD BE

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.959
AVAILABLE TO REVIEW DISPUTES

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:46.726
THAT WERE BROUGHT TO IT BY

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:47.594
PARTIES.

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.695
AGAIN THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:49.963
BETWEEN A REGULAR THAT SITS AND

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:52.499
LOOKS AT EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:53.833
OF AN AGREEMENT COMES YOU FOR IT.

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.968
PROBABLY NOT PRACTICAL IT ANYWAY

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.669
IN ANY CASE AND EVERY GENE WHICH

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:59.339
THE FCC SAID WILL BE A JUDGE OF

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:00.673
SOMEONE HAS HAS A PROBLEM --

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.642
WITH THAT I WIL --

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:03.176
SEE THE FLOOR AND WAIT FOR

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.944

01:53:05.011 --> 01:53:05.778
THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

COMMITTEE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:17.090
OPPOSE HAS BE EIGHT TWENTY TWO

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:17.390

AMENDED TODAY.

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:23.096
BUTTONS NOT A SUGGESTION THAT WE

01:53:23.163 --> 01:53:24.664
BELIEVE WELL AS SOME OF THE

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:26.399
WITNESSES HAVE INDICATED THAT

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:27.400
THE SAYS OF HISTORY TO NET

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:29.302
NEUTRALITY FAR BEYOND THAT WE

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:31.371
BELIEVE THE BILL EVEN AS AMENDED.

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.972
GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN A

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:35.241
BOMB ORDER AND WE STRONGLY

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:37.177
BELIEVE THAT OF THE STATE BY

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.912
STATE REGULATION OF THE INTERNET.

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:40.246
IS INAPPROPRIATE --

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:44.984
AND THE THE ROOM RARELY DO THAT --

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.186
THE FALLACY AT THE HEART OF S.

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:48.288
B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO OR EVEN THE

BILL AS AMENDED.

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:50.823
UP IS THE FALSE PRESUMPTION THAT

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:52.025
ONE SIDE OF NET NEUTRALITY

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:53.326

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:53.960
INTERNET.

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:56.963
THAT IS FALSE --

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:59.199
THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE

01:53:59.265 --> 01:53:59.832
TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER WHICH

01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:01.868
IS.

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:04.637
SIMILAR TO BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO

01:54:04.704 --> 01:54:05.672
THE BILL AS AS AMENDED THIS

01:54:05.738 --> 01:54:07.340
MORNING.

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:08.341
BECAUSE THE MOBILE BROADBAND

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:11.077

ANNUALLY [inaudible]

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.117
THAT'S BILLION.

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.619
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.387
UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY --

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:23.690
THESE THE RULES THAT ARE WE

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:26.893
BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY --

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.394
WE TALKED ABOUT MISTER WHEELER

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:29.629
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:32.832
SINGLE NATIONAL REGULATORY MODEL --

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:34.901
BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE.

01:54:34.968 --> 01:54:37.937
THE FEAR OF UNREALIZED HARM.

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:40.440
BE THE BASIS FOR ENACTING LAWS

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:41.674
THAT WILL CURB THE NEXT

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:43.676

S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS

01:54:49.916 --> 01:54:53.052

BROADBAND PROVIDERS TO A GREATER

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:55.688

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.224
SO WHEN MY CONSTITUENTS COME TO

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:46.959
BE AN ASK TO HAVE A DISCUSSION

02:02:47.026 --> 02:02:48.794
ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY I USE A

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:50.429
METAPHOR AND MAYBE BE HELPFUL.

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:51.731
SO WHAT I TALK ABOUT IS A

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.631
VILLAGE BESIDE A RIVER

02:02:52.698 --> 02:02:52.932
[inaudible]

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:57.069
AND A A BRIDGE OPERATOR BUILDS A

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.337
BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER TO THE

02:02:58.404 --> 02:02:59.505
VILLAGE WHICH IS GREATLY

02:02:59.572 --> 02:03:00.106
BENEFICIAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:01.474
LIVE THERE.

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.842
BUT TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:03.809
CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGE IN

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:04.744
OPERATING THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE

02:03:04.810 --> 02:03:05.644
OPERATOR INSTITUTE TOLLS ON THAT

02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:07.446
BRIDGE.

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:08.981
SO THE QUESTION IS.

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:10.516
IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE AN EIGHTEEN

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:11.784
WHEELER OVER THE BRIDGE SHOULD

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:12.885
THEY PAY THE SAME TOLL AS A

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:14.787
HONDA CIVIC.

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:16.021
AND IF YOU THINK THAT THEY

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.189
SHOULD THEN YOU'RE.

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.457
A PROPONENT OF BRIDGE NEUTRALITY

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:19.725
RIGHT YOU THINK ALL TRAFFIC

02:03:19.792 --> 02:03:21.260
SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME.

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:22.561
HEALTH PRETEND FURTHER THAT THE

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:23.696
BRIDGE OPERATOR WANTS TO CREATE

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:26.365
A ARE A FAST TRACK CLEAN.

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:28.901
WHERE YOU CAN PAY? TO BE ABLE TO

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:30.035
USE THIS LANGUAGE BY THE WAY

02:03:30.102 --> 02:03:30.970
BENEFITS ALL THE USERS OF THE

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.071
BRIDGE BECAUSE DIVERT TRAFFIC

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:33.239
AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:34.206
WILLING TO PAY THAT HIGHER TOLL

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:35.241
THAT'S THAT'S PAID

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:37.243
PRIORITIZATION.

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:38.110
CAPE SO.

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:39.645
I WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS YOU

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.480
KNOW THAT I I'VE WHEN I THINK

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:42.114
ABOUT THE SPENT FOR HAVE A HARD

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:43.215
TIME.

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.050
JUSTIFYING WHY THAT'S NOT AN

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:46.585
OKAY THING TO DO.

02:03:46.652 --> 02:03:49.021
AND THE ONLY ARGUMENT AGAINST

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:50.656
THAT THAT RESONATES TO ME.

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:51.924
IS THAT MAYBE IT GIVES THE

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.893
BRIDGE OPERATOR.

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:55.594
AN UNFAIR AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:56.629
THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT GOES

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:57.897
INTO THE VILLAGE RIGHT OF THE

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.031
BRIDGE OPERATOR DID SOMETHING

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:00.633
OUTRAGEOUS LIKE.

02:04:00.699 --> 02:04:01.801
PROHIBITING TRUCKS THAT HAD BEEN

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:03.102
AND AS IN THEM.

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.403
WE COULD SAY LEGITIMATELY WHILE

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:05.604
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THE BRIDGE

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:06.539
OPERATOR TO DETERMINE WHAT WE'RE

02:04:06.605 --> 02:04:07.273
GOING TO EAT [inaudible]

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:08.908
OKAY.

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:10.643
WHICH IS AGENDA SOME OF THE

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:11.243
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID IN

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:14.313
AND IN THIS DEBATE.

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:15.314
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT'S

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:17.283
REQUIRED. TO PREVENT THAT FROM

02:04:17.349 --> 02:04:18.284
HAPPENING.

02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:20.486
IS MORE BRIDGES.

02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:21.420
THERE'S A BRIDGE A MILE DOWN THE

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:22.454
RIVER.

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:23.556
THAN ANYONE HAS BEEN AND AS IN

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:24.390
THEIR TRUCK IF THEY WERE TO DO

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:26.025
SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS LIKE THAT

02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:26.792
THEY WOULD GO USE A DIFFERENT

02:04:26.859 --> 02:04:27.660
BRIDGE.

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:28.894
AND HERE'S THE BIG PROBLEM THAT

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:29.929
I HAVE WITH WITH.

02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:31.330
THIS ISSUE IN GENERAL NET

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:32.898
NEUTRALITY IN GENERAL IS THAT

02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:35.034
THE MORE.

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.502
OPPRESSIVE REGULATION THAT WE

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:38.003
LATER ON INDUSTRY THE LAST

02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.573
BRIDGES THAT WE GET.

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:41.874
AND OF MORE BRIDGES IS VERY

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:43.275
BENEFICIAL TO OUR SOCIETY THAT

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.877
SOLVES A WHOLE HOST OF PROBLEMS

02:04:44.944 --> 02:04:46.345
INCLUDING A LOT OF THE ONES THAT

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:47.880
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP.

02:04:47.947 --> 02:04:49.281
IN DEBATE TODAY BUT ONE

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:51.116
IMPORTANT ONE THAT HASN'T AND

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.351
THAT IS FAIR PRICING.

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:53.919
YOU GET FAIR PRICING FOR FREE IF

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.921
YOU HAVE LOTS OF BRIDGES.

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:57.456
AND THAT'S WHY.

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:58.257
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AN

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.059
INTELLECTUAL WAY I CAN'T BE A

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:01.694
SUPPORTER OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:02.228
IN THE BILL TODAY EVEN AS

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:02.928
AMENDED?

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:05.731
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:07.032
HM I DID JUST MAKE A STATEMENT

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.467
BEFORE ABOUT WITHDRAWING THE

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:10.102
BILL CONSIDERATION --

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:12.271
TODAY AT THIS HEARING.

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:12.838
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:15.241
QUESTION.

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:15.975
I'D.

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:17.943
MADE A REQUIRED JUST INDICATED

02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:19.178
THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING THE BILL

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:19.778
FROM CONSIDERATION OF TODAY'S

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:33.292
HEARING.

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.594
I'M DISAPPOINTED --

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:40.199
BUT YOU'RE DOING THIS --

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:42.034
YOU AND I HAVE GONE BACK AND

02:05:42.101 --> 02:05:45.237
FORTH ON US.

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:48.274
AND WE STAYED UP EXTREMELY LATE.

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:48.841
AND STARTED VERY EARLY THIS

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:52.811
MORNING [inaudible]

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:55.281
AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:58.651
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:05:58.717 --> 02:05:59.818
I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOT A

02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:00.853
WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ANY

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.689
DEBATE.

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:05.457
AND TO PUT FORTH.

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:07.593
AMENDMENTS TO A COMMITTEE

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:08.527
WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THIS

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.095
COMMITTEE.

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:12.398
THE COMMITTEE'S INPUT.

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:16.635
IT'S A BIT UNFAIR --

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:19.939
OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:22.374
WERE THE EXACT [inaudible]

02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:23.909
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA RULE.

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:26.545
AS AS WRITTEN.

02:06:26.612 --> 02:06:28.747
BUT BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

02:06:28.814 --> 02:06:29.615
VERY VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:31.617
PROPOSING.

02:06:31.684 --> 02:06:34.687
AND THAT WOULD SET A FOUNDATION.

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:39.358
FOR A CONVERSATION. TO CONTINUE.

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:39.825
FOR I MEAN THIS IS THE

02:06:39.892 --> 02:06:42.594
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:44.797
IT'S ABOUT A DEBATE.

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:46.832
IT'S ABOUT GIVE AND TAKE.

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:49.868
IT'S ABOUT COMING. TO A PRODUCT.

02:06:49.935 --> 02:06:51.003
THAT DOES WHAT WE THINK IT

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:53.439
SHOULD DO.

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:55.140
NOW YOU KNOW I BOTH AGREE.

02:06:55.207 --> 02:06:56.508
THAT WE NEED A NOT ENTIRELY

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:58.077
NEUTRALITY BILL.

02:06:58.143 --> 02:07:01.046
AND I WANT A NET NEUTRALITY BILL

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:01.347
[inaudible]

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:04.383
BUT PUT FORTH.

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:07.219
A FEW PAGES.

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.054
AND SAY THIS MIRRORS. FOUR

02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:14.693
HUNDRED PAGES.

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.695
OF WHAT I INTERPRET.

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:19.031
AS AN FCC RULE.

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:19.565
IT'S A BIT UNFAIR TO WILL

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.333
COMMITTEE.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:21.967
BECAUSE WE NEED THE BENEFIT THE

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:22.835
ALSO [inaudible]

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.136
START THIS [inaudible]

02:07:24.203 --> 02:07:26.138
THIS CONVERSATION.

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:27.039
I'M WILLING TO CONTINUE TO

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:30.142
ENGAGE.

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:32.311
BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT UNFAIR.

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:37.182
TO ASSUME THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:07:37.249 --> 02:07:37.483
[inaudible]

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:40.185
I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:40.486
[inaudible]

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:44.857
NOW.

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:45.791
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:48.394
CONVERSATION.

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.030
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD.

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:52.398
AT THE PLATFORM TO JUST BEGIN

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:55.334
THIS CONVERSATION.

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.869
NOW WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:57.903
OF THE CLASS --

02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:00.406
WHEW THE PAST MIDNIGHT AND WE

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:03.575
STARTED PRETTY EARLY --

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:06.211
AND LET'S BE CLEAR.

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:08.547
WE HAVE FOUGHT IN PUSH BACK ON

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:11.683
INDUSTRY. TO GET A NET

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:13.085
NEUTRALITY BILL AND EVERY MEMBER

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:15.020
OF THIS COMMITTEE.

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:15.621
I CAN'T SPEAK THE REPUBLICANS

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.022
EXPECT FOR THE DEMOCRATS ARE

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:20.125
COMMITTED.

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:22.461
HOLIDAY BILL AND WORKING WITH

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:25.264
YOU [inaudible]

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:31.203
BUT WE BOTH UNDERSTAND.

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.671
HOW THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:33.305
WORKS THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS

02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:38.110
AMENDMENTS?

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:38.677
NOT THE MEMBERS COMING TO A

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:39.378
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:41.246
NOW.

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:41.980
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK YOU

02:08:42.047 --> 02:08:43.148
STILL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.650
THIS.

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:46.051
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO CONTINUE THE

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:47.920
CONVERSATION OR YOU CAN CHOOSE

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:49.455
NOT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:50.489
I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING A

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:52.191
CONVERSATION.

02:08:52.257 --> 02:08:53.092
AND IT'S BUT IT'S FOR THAT

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:54.960
REASON ONLY THAT I WOULD I WOULD

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:55.928
ASK FOR A MOTION.

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:57.429

HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:01.066
WE ARE UP AGAINST CERTAIN

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:03.602
DEADLINES.

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:06.472
THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED.

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:08.440
IN ORDER FOR YOU TO CONTINUE

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:11.543
CONVERSATION.

02:09:11.610 --> 02:09:13.979
THAT LEADS CALIFORNIA.

02:09:14.046 --> 02:09:14.880
AGAINST WHAT THE TRUMP

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:16.415
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE.

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:17.116
IT'S TO CONTINUE THIS

02:09:17.182 --> 02:09:20.586
CONVERSATION.

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:21.920
RATHER THAN TO BECOME A MARTYR.

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:23.856
WITH NO BILL.

02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:26.492
SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK IF

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:27.793
THERE WAS THE FIRST IN A SECOND

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.827

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:29.428
CONVERSATION AFTER THIS AND WE

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:31.797
COULD DEBATE.

02:09:31.864 --> 02:09:33.332
MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW.

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:35.367
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.869
BEING A MARTYR.

02:09:36.935 --> 02:09:38.137
THIS IS ABOUT.

02:09:38.203 --> 02:09:40.139
ACTUALLY PROTECTING NET

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:42.374
NEUTRALITY I AND I WILL SAY I'M

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:43.609
DISAPPOINTED AS WELL.

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:45.377
I REVIEW IT YOU AND I HAVE HAD

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:47.179
NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THE

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:49.248
LAST FEW WEEKS AND I CONSIDER

02:09:49.314 --> 02:09:50.949
YOUR FRIENDS AND WE OF WORK AND

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:52.084
WE ARE FRIENDS AND WE'RE WORKING

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:53.385
ON THREE OR FOUR OTHER ISSUES

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:54.887
TOGETHER AND I AND AND WE ARE.

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.588
WE ARE WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS

02:09:56.655 --> 02:09:58.023
HOUSING AND WILL CONTINUE AND

02:09:58.090 --> 02:10:00.492

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:00.692
AGREE.

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:03.295
ON BUT THE REALITY IS AYE THAT

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:05.931
WE DID INDICATE A WILLINGNESS TO

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:07.499
TO GIVE ON SOME AREAS OF THE

02:10:07.566 --> 02:10:09.635
BILL AND UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.103
AMENDMENTS THAT CAME FORWARD.

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:13.772
ARE REMOVE KEY PROTECTIONS THAT

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:16.408
WILL ALLOW THE ICE PEEVES TO

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:18.110
ENGAGE AND THEN THAT IS HOW YOU

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:18.944
VIOLATIONS THAT THEY HAVE

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:20.612
ENGAGED IN THE PAST AND SO.

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:22.014
I INDICATED THE BEGINNING THAT

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.349
WE COULDN'T ACCEPT APPOINTED

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:26.084

THE P. YOU SEE.

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.296
THE CPUC WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS

02:48:26.362 --> 02:48:28.364
ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:48:28.431 --> 02:48:29.432
REGULATE OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:30.934
NETWORK COMPANIES SO IT DOESN'T

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.803
ESTABLISH ANY NEW THE THE PEW

02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:35.972
CRT HAS THAT AUTHORITY --

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:37.474
I'VE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY WITH

02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.309
OUR TNC COMPANIES AND BASED ON

02:48:39.375 --> 02:48:40.810
THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE TAKEN

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:42.879
SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO

02:48:42.946 --> 02:48:43.913
REMOVE PART TARGETS.

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.648
AND REPLACE.

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:47.784
WITH A PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:48:47.851 --> 02:48:50.153
THEM IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:51.554
ENGAGE WITH THE PC AND SETTING

02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:53.823
IN DETERMINING FAIR TARGETS BOTH

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:56.359
THE PC AND THE OUR AIR RESOURCES

02:48:56.426 --> 02:48:59.662
BOARD -- NOW

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:01.431
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S RAISED

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:03.099
OCCASIONALLY IS THE FACT THAT

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:05.668
THE TNC STONE OWN VEHICLES.

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:08.838
AND THEY THE DRIVERS WHO UNIT

02:49:08.905 --> 02:49:12.308
WHO ARE IN EFFECT I'D DEPLOYED

02:49:12.375 --> 02:49:13.843
THROUGH THEIR PLATFORMS ARE NOT

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:15.345
THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SUCH ALL OF

02:49:15.411 --> 02:49:18.414
THIS IS TRUE --

02:49:18.481 --> 02:49:20.817
BUT WE ALREADY S. A STATE HAVE

02:49:20.884 --> 02:49:22.752
THE EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE WE

02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:24.721
ARE SUPPORTING AND SUBSIDIZING

02:49:24.787 --> 02:49:27.156
WHICH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:29.359
MONEY TO SUPPORT CHARGING PUBLIC

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:31.394
CHARGING THROUGHOUT THE STATES

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:33.096
OR CHARGING OF VEHICLES THAT

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:33.863
THIS WOULD.

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:35.565
THIS BILL WOULD PROMOTE AND

02:49:35.632 --> 02:49:38.067
ADDITIONALLY REBATES.

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:40.103
AND OUR REBATE PROGRAM INTO THE

02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:41.704
CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM.

02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:43.973
SPECIFIES THAT 25% OF THAT

02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:44.807
REBATE WOULD GO TO LOW INCOME

02:49:44.874 --> 02:49:48.945
DRIVERS NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH.

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:51.114
ARE -- WHILE

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:52.582
TEN FOURTEEN MY BILL DOES NOT

02:49:52.649 --> 02:49:54.651
PUT THIS ONUS ON THE

02:49:54.717 --> 02:49:56.586
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:58.054
TO ASSIST THE DRIVERS ON THEIR

02:49:58.121 --> 02:49:58.888
PLATFORM.

02:49:58.955 --> 02:50:01.457
UBER HAS JUST ANNOUNCED PILOTS

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:03.560
IN SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO AND

02:50:03.626 --> 02:50:05.795
SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY ARE GOING

02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:07.196
TO PAY A DRIVERS.

02:50:07.263 --> 02:50:09.999
OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT

02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:11.601
ARE DEPLOYED ON THEIR PLATFORM

02:50:11.668 --> 02:50:13.336
ONE DOLLAR TWO DOLLARS FIFTY

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:14.470
MORE PER RIDE.

02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:15.805
SO THAT'S A PILOT THAT THEY

02:50:15.872 --> 02:50:17.140
THEMSELVES ARE ALREADY ENGAGED

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:18.641
IN.

02:50:18.708 --> 02:50:19.509
I'M.

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:26.482
THAT WE MIGHT TAKE IN ASSEMBLY

02:50:28.117 --> 02:50:29.452
REGULARLY WITH THEM.

02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:30.954
BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.522

BILL I WAS ACTUALLY QUITE

03:00:59.548 --> 03:01:00.416
DELIGHTED --

03:01:00.482 --> 03:01:02.318
WITH THE THE CONCEPTUAL NATURE

03:01:02.384 --> 03:01:04.119
OF WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT

03:01:04.186 --> 03:01:05.120
IS SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

03:01:05.187 --> 03:01:06.889
THAT AND AS YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES

03:01:06.956 --> 03:01:08.857
WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT IT'S THE

03:01:08.924 --> 03:01:10.025
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES.

03:01:10.092 --> 03:01:11.527
AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE

03:01:11.594 --> 03:01:12.928
TESTIMONY THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE

03:01:12.995 --> 03:01:14.763
DISTINCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:16.165
OTHER FOR HIGHER TRANSPORTATION

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:17.700
ALSO TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

03:01:17.766 --> 03:01:18.367
COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE WELL AWARE

03:01:18.434 --> 03:01:20.436
OF TWO AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

03:01:20.502 --> 03:01:21.904
THE POLICIES IN PLACE FOR THAT

03:01:21.971 --> 03:01:23.572
SIMILAR TYPE OF INCENTIVES --

03:01:23.639 --> 03:01:25.541
CAN YOU GIVE A SENSE ON THE FROM

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:27.977
AS THE AUTHOR THE LET'S ENDING

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:28.577
THAT.

03:01:28.644 --> 03:01:30.212
DISCREPANCY IN THE DISTINCTION

03:01:30.279 --> 03:01:31.814
BETWEEN THAT OF TNC EASE AND

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:33.515
ENSURING THAT WE WANT.

03:01:33.582 --> 03:01:35.084
TO GET TO A CERTAIN GOAL OF

03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:36.285
ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS BUT ALSO

03:01:36.352 --> 03:01:37.920
ENSURING THAT THE INCENTIVES ARE

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:39.255
IN PLACE FOR SIMILAR OTHER FOR

03:01:39.321 --> 03:01:40.556
HIGHER TRANSPORT.

03:01:40.623 --> 03:01:42.891
SO A COUPLE SPECIFICS ONE THE

03:01:42.958 --> 03:01:46.128
BILL IS NOT THE IS WRITTEN

03:01:46.195 --> 03:01:46.428
[inaudible]

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:49.698
TO ON MILES SO IT WOULD NOT.

03:01:49.765 --> 03:01:51.634
NECESSARILY AFFECT ALL DRIVERS

03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:53.168
ON THE PLATFORM OR ALL VEHICLES

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:55.437
ON THE PLATFORM THE REAL.

03:01:55.504 --> 03:01:57.106
POINT IN A FOR THINKING OF IT

03:01:57.172 --> 03:01:58.240
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW WAS

03:01:58.307 --> 03:02:00.709
CERTAINLY THE THE STATE HAS.

03:02:00.776 --> 03:02:03.545
A VERY AMBITIOUS FIVE MILLION

03:02:03.612 --> 03:02:05.514
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CALL AND

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:07.182
IF WE ARE JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS

03:02:07.249 --> 03:02:08.817
THAT THERE WOULD ONE AFFECT ALL

03:02:08.884 --> 03:02:10.419
VEHICLES AND ALL DRIVERS ON THE

03:02:10.486 --> 03:02:11.320
PLATFORM.

03:02:11.387 --> 03:02:13.055
BUT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

03:02:13.122 --> 03:02:14.990
BALANCE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

03:02:15.057 --> 03:02:16.692
SOME DRIVERS THAT YOU KNOW

03:02:16.759 --> 03:02:19.928
REALLY ONLY USE ONLY DRIVE --

03:02:19.995 --> 03:02:21.697
FOR TNC VERY FEW HOURS A WEEK

03:02:21.764 --> 03:02:23.565
AND PROBABLY VERY FEW MILES AND

03:02:23.632 --> 03:02:25.100
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHY DO WE

03:02:25.167 --> 03:02:27.169
HAVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOAL

03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:28.404
BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

03:02:28.470 --> 03:02:30.639
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS SO WHERE WE

03:02:30.706 --> 03:02:31.540
GETTING THE MOST TAILPIPE

03:02:31.607 --> 03:02:32.174
EMISSIONS.

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:33.842
FROM THE VEHICLES THAT ARE

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:36.178
DRIVING THE MOST MILES SO THAT'S

03:02:36.245 --> 03:02:38.447
WHY I'VE DESIGNED THE BILL TO BE

03:02:38.514 --> 03:02:40.549
TARGETED TOWARDS MILES SO WOULD

03:02:40.616 --> 03:02:42.718
POTENTIALLY IMPACT ONLY THOSE

03:02:42.785 --> 03:02:44.620
DRIVERS WHO ARE REALLY.

03:02:44.687 --> 03:02:47.323
USING THEIR VEHICLE IT FROM MANY

03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:49.825
MORE HOURS AND MANY MORE MILES

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:51.727
ON A TNC PLATFORM NOW

03:02:51.794 --> 03:02:52.428
ADDITIONALLY.

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:55.564
BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY RECENT --

03:02:55.631 --> 03:02:58.434
ADVANCES IN TERMS OF SOME MODELS

03:02:58.500 --> 03:02:59.868
WITH GREAT RANGE AND IT'S A

03:02:59.935 --> 03:03:01.603
LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT IF YOU'RE

03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:03.739
IN ONE OF THE OLD VERSION NEED

03:03:03.806 --> 03:03:05.474
THESE THAT HAS VERY LIMITED

03:03:05.541 --> 03:03:06.942
RANGE IT REALLY DOES PUT YOU AT

03:03:07.009 --> 03:03:08.043
A DISADVANTAGE.

03:03:08.110 --> 03:03:10.045
BUT THE BILL HAS THESE MILES

03:03:10.112 --> 03:03:12.014
TARGETS AS VERY GRADUAL AND IS

03:03:12.081 --> 03:03:14.016
NOW DESIGNED TO ALLOW BOTH THEY

03:03:14.083 --> 03:03:15.417
ARE BEING P. YOU SEE DE

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:16.385
DETERMINED.

03:03:16.452 --> 03:03:18.987
WHAT IF TO FACTOR IN THINGS LIKE

03:03:19.054 --> 03:03:21.623
THE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES

03:03:21.690 --> 03:03:23.926
WITH A WIDE RANGE SO IN OTHER

03:03:23.992 --> 03:03:25.194
WORDS IF THE MARKET CONDITIONS

03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:26.929
ARE SUCH?

03:03:26.995 --> 03:03:28.630
THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET

03:03:28.697 --> 03:03:30.432
THE GOALS THEN THEY WILL BE

03:03:30.499 --> 03:03:32.401
DELAYED OR THEY WILL BE MODIFIED

03:03:32.468 --> 03:03:33.502
SO I'VE STRIPPED WHAT THE

03:03:33.569 --> 03:03:36.004
SPECIFIC GOALS ARE TO ALLOW. TO

03:03:36.071 --> 03:03:37.172
FACTOR IN THOSE MARKET

03:03:37.239 --> 03:03:41.009
CONDITIONS ADDITIONALLY THE BILL

03:03:41.076 --> 03:03:42.344
AND YOU DIDN'T ASK THIS QUESTION

03:03:42.411 --> 03:03:44.413
IF YOU TURN TO NINE PAGE NINE OF

03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:45.214
THE BILL.

03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:47.683
IT SPECIFIES THAT THE DAY WILL

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:49.651
NEED TO ENSURE A MINIMAL

03:03:49.718 --> 03:03:51.420
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME

03:03:51.487 --> 03:03:53.422
AND MODERATE INCOME DRIVERS SO

03:03:53.489 --> 03:03:54.423
AGAIN.

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:56.725
THAT THIS NOTION THAT THIS BILL

03:03:56.792 --> 03:03:58.694
WOULD UNFAIRLY HARM THE LOW

03:03:58.761 --> 03:03:59.928
INCOME DRIVERS IT IS

03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:02.097
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO FACTOR

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:02.564
THAT.

03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:05.667
AND AS I INDICATED BEFORE OUR

03:04:05.734 --> 03:04:06.735
EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE THE

03:04:06.802 --> 03:04:09.138
STATE HAS INVESTED TO HELP MEET

03:04:09.204 --> 03:04:10.472
OUR GOALS.

03:04:10.539 --> 03:04:12.307
TARGET SPECIFICALLY.

03:04:12.374 --> 03:04:14.176
LOW INCOME DRIVERS TO HAVE THEM

03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:15.677
BENEFIT MOST SO.

03:04:15.744 --> 03:04:17.312
I THINK HOPEFULLY THOSE HER

03:04:17.379 --> 03:04:18.380
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

03:04:18.447 --> 03:04:20.682
YOU RACED.

03:04:20.749 --> 03:04:21.817
YES SIR OF A MY MISTER TO A PART

03:04:21.884 --> 03:04:24.253
OF THE CHALLENGE I THINK AGAIN

03:04:24.319 --> 03:04:25.654
THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OF

03:04:25.721 --> 03:04:27.823
FOR HIRE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES

03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:28.690
AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

03:04:28.757 --> 03:04:29.391
COMPANIES.

03:04:29.458 --> 03:04:30.826
OTHER NUANCES BETWEEN THEM AND

03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:32.261
UNDERSTANDING THE POLICIES DON'T

03:04:32.327 --> 03:04:33.762
NECESSARILY FIT IN --

03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:35.798
AND WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT THAT

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:37.166
YOU HAVE I DO THINK THAT'S

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:38.867
MERITS FURTHER CONVERSATION TO

03:04:38.934 --> 03:04:40.602
MOVE FORWARD AND I WILL SUPPORT

03:04:40.669 --> 03:04:42.204
THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I DO.

03:04:42.271 --> 03:04:42.838
APPRECIATE THE INTENT BUT I HOPE

03:04:42.905 --> 03:04:46.008
THAT YOU WILL.

03:04:46.074 --> 03:04:47.509
SAYS TO IDENTIFY THE

03:04:47.576 --> 03:04:48.911
DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THAT OF THE

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:50.612
INCENTIVES IN TRYING TO MAKE IT

03:04:50.679 --> 03:04:52.681
ALSO WORK OF IT BECAUSE WE WANT

03:04:52.748 --> 03:04:54.016
TO SEE THESE TREACHEROUS NETWORK

03:04:54.082 --> 03:04:55.551
COMPANIES ALSO COMPLY AND ALSO

03:04:55.617 --> 03:04:56.752
JOIN US IN OUR IN OUR

03:04:56.819 --> 03:04:58.053
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS --

03:04:58.120 --> 03:04:59.555
SO I I AM I AM HOPEFUL THAT

03:04:59.621 --> 03:05:01.023
YOU'LL STAY COMMITTED --

03:05:01.089 --> 03:05:01.824
IN THE GOOD FAITH TO THAT AS

03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:03.392
WELL SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE

03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:07.029
THE BILL.

03:05:07.095 --> 03:05:08.130
FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE.

03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:11.567
MEMBERS.

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:14.203
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP.

03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:15.237
SENATOR OF SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

03:05:15.304 --> 03:05:15.804
THE BILL --

03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:17.806
I'M WONDERING FIRST DO WE PUT A

03:05:17.873 --> 03:05:19.608
SIMILAR REQUIREMENT ON THE

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:21.276
COMPANIES THAT THESE TNC EASE

03:05:21.343 --> 03:05:22.778
COMPETE WITH LIKE TAXI COMPANIES

03:05:22.845 --> 03:05:24.713
OF LOS.

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:27.282
I'M WE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS

03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:29.284
NOW AND FLEET OWNERS.

03:05:29.351 --> 03:05:32.020
I IN FACT I CARRIED A BILL FOR

03:05:32.087 --> 03:05:34.556
WITH THAT WHERE THE A ARE BEING

03:05:34.623 --> 03:05:36.492
NOW BOTH THE STATE FLEET MUST

03:05:36.558 --> 03:05:37.893
MEET A CERTAIN PERCENT OF THESE

03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:38.727
ZAPS.

03:05:38.794 --> 03:05:40.762
AND ARB IS NOW IN POWER TO

03:05:40.829 --> 03:05:42.397
IMPOSE THAT ON PRIVATE SECTOR

03:05:42.464 --> 03:05:44.032
FLEETS THEY'VE NOT DONE THE

03:05:44.099 --> 03:05:46.301
REGULATORY ACTIONS YET BUT THEY

03:05:46.368 --> 03:05:47.736
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO.

03:05:47.803 --> 03:05:50.105
AND TAXIS IN MANY CASES ARE
