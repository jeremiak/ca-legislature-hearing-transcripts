THIS IS FILE ITEM FORTY SEVEN EACH OR SEVENTY FOUR CLERK WILL READ HOUSE RESOLUTION SEVENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KITA WEBER RELATIVE TO HEALTH MISINFORMATION THOUGHT TO RECORD WE ARE RECOGNIZED HERE OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. H. I. SEVENTY FOUR SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CURBING PUBLIC HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND THE THREAT THAT IT POSES TO OUR SOCIETY. WELL HEALTH MISINFORMATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM ADVANCES IN DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY NOW ALLOW IT TO SPREAD AT UNPRECEDENTED SPEED. SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC MISINFORMATION HAS CAUSED RAMPANT CONFUSION AND MISTRUST THAT UNDERMINE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS. MISINFORMATION HAS CAUSED CONFUSION AND NATIONALLY HAS LED TO MANY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS DECLINING COBIT NINETEEN VACCINES REJECTING PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES RELATING TO MASKING OR PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND USING UNPROVEN TREATMENTS. WITH OVER FOUR MILLION CONFIRMED CASES AND OVER SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CONFIRMED DEATH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS THREAT HAS PROLONGED THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC ENDANGERING THE SAFETY AND LIFE AND HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT HAS BECOME SO PREVALENT IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. THAT THE UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL HAS ISSUED OFFICIAL GUIDANCE IN THE MATTER. I APPLAUD THE RECENT EFFORTS OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LED BY SUPERVISOR NATHAN FLETCHER WHO INTRODUCED A SIMILAR RESOLUTION IN MY COUNTY. THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS HEALTH MISINFORMATION IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF US IN EVERY SECTOR OF SOCIETY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT. EACH OF US CAN DO OUR OWN PART TO CONFRONT MISINFORMATION. BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THE MASS MEDIA ARE NEEDED TO CURB THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS AND LIMIT THE DISSEMINATION OF FAKE NEWS. WE SHOULD ALL WANT TO WORK TOWARDS CREATING A HEALTHIER INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. ONE THAT EMPOWERS US TO A WELL INFORMED KINDER AND MORE CONNECTED WORLD. BUT WE MUST USE THAT POWER TOGETHER. H. R. SEVENTY FOUR IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS A RECOGNITION THAT THE SPREAD OF HEALTH MIS INFORMATION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND URGES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO COMMIT TO COMBATING THE SPREAD OF FALSEHOODS THAT THREATEN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I LIKE THE FIRST ROLE TO BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS.

IN PEOPLE'S MISGUIDED OPINIONS THAT THEY FIND UNFORTUNATELY- ON PLATFORMS AND DIFFERENT PLACES WE NEED TO GET BACK TO FAX IN ORDER THAT WE CAN GET OUT THIS PANDEMIC IN ORDER THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR CITIZENS SAFE SO THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA MESA FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I.

MEMBERS WILL BE WE WILL BE MOVING TO FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY SB TWO PURPLE READ. SENATE BILL TWO BY SOONER BRADFORD AND OTHERS IMMACULATE IN THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT DR WEBER YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TO PRESENT SB TWO THE KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR POLICE DECERTIFICATION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR BRADFORD I'M PRO TEM. ACAN THIS BILL WAS NAMED AFTER KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR A CONSTITUENT OF SENATOR BRADFORD WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AT RALLY PARK IN GARDENA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. HE WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE WAS UNARMED. HE WAS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. AND HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK AND KILLED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. KENNETH ROTH WAS SHOT AND KILLED. BY AN OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN MULTIPLE SHOOTINGS IN A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AN OFFICER IF WE HAD A DECERTIFICATION SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE TO APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE STANDARDS. UNFORTUNATELY KENNETH'S DEATH IS NOT UNIQUE. IT IS REFLECTIVE OF A PROBLEM THAT PERVADES OUR STATE AND COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THERE ARE PROBLEMATIC OFFICERS THAT COMMIT MISCONDUCT IN ONE DEPARTMENT. AND ARE EITHER NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THAT DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BUT ARE ABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AND OUR STATE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONLY ONE OF FOUR STATES. THAT DOES NOT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION SYSTEM. CALIFORNIANS CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE ADVOCATE AND POLICE THEMSELVES ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. SB TWO IS A THOUGHTFUL WELL MEANING APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE THAT AFFORDS AMPLE DUE PROCESS FOR OFFICERS. FIVE NECESSARY COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION AND ENSURES THAT GOOD OFFICERS ARE NOT DECERTIFIED. THIS BILL CREATES A STATE WIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER AFTER COMMITTING A SERIOUS A SERIES OF CRIMES OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS. THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. ALSO KNOWN AS POST. A COMMISSION THAT IS PRIMARILY MADE UP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO INVESTIGATE GROUNDS FOR OFFICER MISCONDUCT. SB TWO ALSO CREATES AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH IN POST THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POST SHOULD DECERTIFY AN OFFICER. FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE. BY REGULATION THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION. ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE WHAT EXACTLY IS KIND IT CAN LEAD TO DESERTIFICATION. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS. PREVIOUSLY THE ADVISORY BOARD INCLUDED TWO PUBLIC MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT OR WHO ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE SUFFERED PLEASE MAKE CONTACT. NOW THOSE TWO SEATS ARE GENERALLY FOR NOT ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH STRONG CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY POLICE VIOLENCE. PREVIOUSLY POST COMMISSION IT'D MAJORITY VOTE TO APPROVE DECERTIFICATION. NOW POST COMMISSION NEEDS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN ORDER TO DECERTIFY SOMEONE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN THIS HOUSE. PREVIOUSLY THE BILL WAS SILENT ON PRIOR CLAIMS OF ADJUDICATION. NOW THE BILL EXPLICITLY STATES THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL CHANGES EXISTING LAW ABOUT COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL. PREVIOUSLY POSED MUSTY CERTIFYING OFFICER WHO HAD COMMITTED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. NOW POST HAS THE OPTION OF DECERTIFYING THE SPENDING CERTIFICATION OR IMPOSING NO SANCTIONS AT ALL FOR OFFICERS WHO COMMITTED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. POST HAS THE OPTION TO SUSPEND AN OFFICER OR IMPOSE NO SANCTION AT ALL EVEN IF THE ADVISORY BOARD RECOMMENDS DECERTIFICATION. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A TECHNICAL ERROR BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL REGARDING ONE OF THE AMENDMENT IN THIS BILL. THE AMENDMENT CLARIFYING THAT EXISTING LAW OF COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL APPLIES. TO THIS BILL WAS PLACED IN THE WRONG SECTION BUT IT WILL BE CORRECTED IN A DIFFERENT BILL IN THE COMING DAYS. SO IN CONCLUSION SB TWO CREATES ONE OF THE STRONGEST DECERTIFICATION SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH MORE DUE PROCESS. FOR OFFICERS AND CIVILIAN REPRESENTATION AND PUT. AT EVERY STAGE IN THIS PROCESS. THERE IS LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATION. IN FACT THE PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF INPUT FOR THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING POST COMMISSION. THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT TO SERVE NOT ONLY TO SERVE BUT PROTECT. PROTECT THE CITIZENS PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE BATCH AND PROTECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT AN ANTI POLICE BILL. THIS IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY BAIL. WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY WE LOSE INTEGRITY OF THE BAD AND THE BOND WITH THE COMMUNITY IS BROKEN. A BROKEN BOND AND DISCUSSED CAN LEAD TO THE EVENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN IN OUR STATE. WHETHER IT WAS BERGESEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES OR EVEN IN MY CITY OF LA MESA. TYPICALLY WE SAY IF CALIFORNIA GOES SO DOES THE REST OF THE NATION. YEAH WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND IN THIS ISSUE OF DECERTIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO CATCH UP TO THE FORTY SIX OTHER STATES THAT HAVE PROCESSES IN ALREADY TODAY. THE LET'S RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE LOST AND WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED PROFESSIONS IN THE COUNTRY. LET'S GUARANTEE THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL GIVEN A BADGE A GUN. AND THE INCREDIBLE POWER IS PROPERLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE WEEDING OUT THOSE UNFIT FOR THIS JOB. THE TIME IS NOW TO CREATE POLICE THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IT MUST BE STRONG AND TRUSTED BY OUR COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. MISTER SPEAKER SB TWO IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT WE PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM OFFICERS WHO COMMIT AGREES MISCONDUCT AND CREATE GREATER TRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THOSE WHO ABIDE BY THEIR OATH OF SERVICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ARGUES THAT OF THEIR AGENCY DIDN'T FIRE THEM FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IMPOSED SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION. THEY SAY THIS EXPOSES THEM TO DOUBLE JEOPARDY. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT WHAT DOUBLE JEOPARDY IS A AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER I CAN ASSURE YOU. DOUBLE JEOPARDY MEANS BEING PROSECUTED TWICE FOR THE SAME PROSECUTOR FOR THE EXACT SAME CRIME ONCE A PROSPEROUS PROSECUTED ONCE THE RESULTS ARE BINDING THEY CANNOT TRY AGAIN IN HOPES OF A DIFFERENT RESULT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT. POST BRINGING DECERTIFICATION PROCEEDINGS IS NOT THE SAME AS EMPLOYING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BRINGING DISCIPLINE. AS AN ATTORNEY. I CAN BE INVESTIGATED M. DISBARRED BY THE STATE BAR EVEN IF MY EMPLOYER DOES NOT FIRE ME THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO ATTORNEY TURNS WORKING PRIVATE FIRMS BUT FOR THOSE WHO WORK FOR GOVERNMENT OR STATE AGENCIES. SAME GOES FOR OTHER LICENSED PROFESSIONS THINK ABOUT A DOCTOR'S CAN LOSE THEIR LICENSES EVEN IF THEY'RE STILL EMPLOYED. THE CALIBER CALIBER WOULD BE THE KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS HOW WE ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO VIOLATE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS STOP HARMING THE PUBLIC EVEN IF THEIR EMPLOYER HAS DECIDED TO OVERLOOK THEIR BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY. IF THEIR JOB IS TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE PUBLIC. NEVERTHELESS THE AUTHOR AS INDICATED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THIS ISSUE. ONE OFFICER COMMITS EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND FABRICATING EVIDENCE IT SHOULD WARRANT A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS BY POSTERS CHARMAN IF THAT OFFICER IS WORTHY OF HOLDING THAT BATCH. THE PUBLIC IS LOSING TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SB TWO IS A MEANS TO NOT ONLY HOLD. OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT ALSO NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO INSTILL PUBLIC TRUST IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE CAN TAKE A CRUCIAL STEP TO BRINGING CALIFORNIA'S POLICING LAWS IN LINE WITH THE LONG STANDING. NATIONAL STANDARD RESPECTFULLY ASK RELIABLE ON SB TWO. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. MY HEART IS A LITTLE BIT HEAVY THIS MORNING SOMETHING ABOUT ALLIES MCLEAN IN MATAMATA AUBREY ABOUT TO MERE. WITH QUAN MCDONALD THEY'LL FORD WHAT HE SHE WILL SEND FREDDIE GRAY SANDRA BLAND. AND KENNETH ROSS JUNE. AND MANY MANY MORE AS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THE WINDS OF CHANGE BLOW FROM THE WEST. TO THE EAST. YEAH WE ARE ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES. THAT DOES NOT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR MISCONDUCT. MY HEART WAS BROKEN LAST YEAR THAT THIS BILL COULDN'T MOVE TO THIS BODY IN THE SAME YEAR THAT MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE PROTESTED IN ANY POINT IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WE COULDN'T MOVE THIS BILL. THE STAIN ON HIS BODY IT'S A STAIN THAT WE CAN LIVE TODAY. WE ALL RAN TO DO THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN FOR COMMUNITIES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LEAD A MODEL FOR THIS NATION. WE'RE BEHIND WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SEND THIS BILL TO THE GOVERNOR I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AYE VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER BRYANT SOME OF OUR CAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO IN MARCH JUST BLOCKS FOR MY DISTRICT OFFICE TYRELL WILSON WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION. HE WAS A PROMISING FOOTBALL PLAYER WHO GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT AND ENDED DESTROYED HIS FUTURE HE WAS THEN LIVING ON HOUSING MY DISTRICT AND HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED. BY A POLICE OFFICER MONTHS LATER. HE WAS IN MONTHS MAYBE EVEN WEEKS WEEKS LATER THAT'S OFFICER WAS CHARGED IN THE KILLING OF ANOTHER MAN. WHO WAS KILLED IN THAT SAME CITY. MR ARBOLEDA WHO WAS ALSO SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS BY THE SAME POLICE OFFICER A YEAR BEFORE AND I WANTED TO SET UP AN ECHO WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HAS SAID. THIS HAS TOUCHED EACH AND EVERYONE OF US NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DISTRICT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SEEN OFFICERS WHO DON'T DESERVE TO WEAR THE BADGE CONTINUE ON THE BEAT. AND THERE ARE INCIDENTS WHERE THEN WE SEE LIFE TAKEN AGAIN. AND IF WE CAN SAVE THOSE LIVES MEMBERS WE MUST. THAT IS THE OBLIGATION THAT WE HAVE ONE OF MANY. AND SO TODAY I ASK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO DO THIS WE WORKED HARD ON THIS BILL. AND WE MADE SURE THAT DUE PROCESS IS INTACT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE THAT CARRY THE BAGGAGE DO IT WITH HONOR IN THAT WE HAVE TRUST ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THOSE. THAT HAVE ALREADY KILLED. THEY WILL BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME FOR THAT KILLING ARE NO LONGER ON THE STREETS WEARING THE BADGING CARRYING THAT GUN. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY MAY KILL AGAIN. AND SO WITH THAT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I ASK THE TODAY. WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ONE OF JUST FOUR STATES THAT HAVE TAKEN THE STEP THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR OUR CANS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SARATOGA RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. SADLY I HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS PARTICULAR VERSION OF SB TWO. WHILE THERE IS BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AN AGREEMENT AMONG SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYERS AND EVEN THE REPRESENTATIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEES. THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN THE OTHER FORTY SIX STATES. AND BY HAVING A STATUTORY MECHANISM TO SUSPEND OR DECERTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR MISCONDUCT. BY THAT FALL SHORT A FELONY CONVICTION. I WOULD SUPPORT A BILL TO DO THAT AS LONG AS IT CONTAINED REASONABLE STANDARDS AND FAIR PROCEDURES UNFORTUNATELY. ALTHOUGH RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE IMPROVED THIS BILL SOMEWHAT SB TWO IS NOT THE BILL. I HAVE THREE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. FIRST IS THE COMPOSITION OF THE NINE MEMBER PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS ACCOUNTABILITY ADVISORY BOARD. IT IS GROSSLY UNFAIR. IT INCLUDES ONLY TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT NEITHER OF THEM REPRESENTING RANK AND FILE OFFICERS. SIX OR SEVEN OF THE OTHERS CAN BE. ARE VERY HOSTILE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS CREATES A BIAS. THE REASON AMENDMENT PROVIDING THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ONLY REQUIRED TO GIVE STRONG CONSIDERATION TO APPOINTING TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RUN FULL USE OF FORCE LIKELY THE CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY BY POLICE OFFICER OR WHO ARE SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS OF A PERSON KILLED. BY THE WRONGFUL USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS IS SMALL COMFORT. THE TRUTH IS OF THE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOCTORS AND LAWYERS. THEIR BOARDS DON'T HAVE PEOPLE. THAT WE'RE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A BAD SURGERY. OR BAD REPRESENTATION THEY HAVE LAWYERS THEY HAVE PROFESSIONALS THAT KNOW WHAT THAT JOB IS. AND THIS DOES NOT DO THAT. NONE OF THE OTHER FORTY SIX STATES HAVE A SIMILAR COMPOSITION FOR THEIR OVERSIGHT BOARDS AND MAKE THIS DECERTIFICATION DETERMINATION. SOME STATES HAVE BOARDS THAT DO NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT NONE OF THEM. ARE THIS LOPSIDED. FOR EXAMPLE MASSACHUSETTS WHICH IS HARDLY A BASTION OF CONSERVATIVE IT'S OF THE STATE. BUT- IT ADOPTED IN YOUR SEARCH DECERTIFICATION LAW LAST YEAR. THERE BOARD INCLUDE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A RANK AND FILE OFFICER TO OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THE SOCIAL WORKER A RETIRED JUDGE AN ATTORNEY APPOINTED BY THE CIVIL RIGHTS SECTION OF MASSACHUSETTS BAR AND THREE PUBLIC MEMBERS APPOINTED JOINTLY. BY THE GOVERNOR THIS IS A MUCH FAIRER COMPOSITION THAN THE ONE PROPOSED IN SB TWO. THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD WITH IT IS THE BIG. DESCRIPTION OF MANY OF THE NON FELONY- TYPE OF OFFENSES THAT AN OFFICER CAN BE ACCUSED OF- ANYONE OF US IN OUR WERE IN THIS ROOM. HAS HAS HAD STATEMENT THAT THEY'VE MADE THAT OTHER PEOPLE MISCONSTRUE IN TURN INTO SOMETHING THAT ISN'T. IF YOU THOSE TO. S. TWO. IS A COME SO BILL BUT IN A CURRENT. FORM IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IT. SO SHOULD THE OTHER FORTY SIX STATES AND HAVING A DECERTIFICATION BILL BUT WE SHOULD ALSO USE THOSE BILLS THAT ARE IN THE OTHER FORTY SIX STATES. COMPOSE THIS ONE SO THAT IT IS FAIR THAT IT IS NOT BIASED. AND I THINK ANYBODY WHO IS WHAT WE HAVE SEVERAL OF OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS IN HERE YOU WOULD NEVER PUT A BIASED PERSON ON A JURY. AND THIS IS THE SAME THING. SO MAKE THAT THING LESS BIASED AND WE'VE GOT US A BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SADDAM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU A SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT BILL FOR ME AND I SEE THAT WHITES NEEDED. ALL THE STORIES WE SEE OUT THERE NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THROUGHOUT OUR NATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENED. IN REGARDS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE USE OF FORCE I KNOW WE HAD A BILL A FEW YEARS AGO REGARDING USE OF FORCE NOT BILLS ALSO DIFFICULT FOR ME AS WELL. R. AS REMOVING THE PROCESS ALONG WITH THE CERTIFICATION WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY IS CHALLENGING FOR ME I KNOW I WANT TO THANK OFFER FOR. HIS WORK IT AND GETTING IT TO A BETTER PLACE BUT STILL I THINK THERE'S MORE. OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OF THE BILL I THINK THAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE TO THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. OF ONE OF THE CONCERNS I'M HAVING TO IS YOUR GOING BACK THIRTY YEARS AND THEN OFFICERS CAREER SOUNDS LIKE. AND THAT'S KIND OF DISTURBING TO ME AS WE LOOK AT. OTHER BILLS WE TALK ABOUT. TODAY AND WE'RE LOOKING AT EXPUNGING PEOPLE'S RECORDS OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST BUT HERE WOULD LAW ENFORCEMENT WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN WHAT THEY DID THIRTY YEARS AGO- YES WE GOTTA GET THESE ABOUT OFFICERS OFF THE STREETS OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH WHEN I THINK WE NEED MORE. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES CONCERNED TO GET MAKE SURE THE BILLS AT A BETTER PLACE WE'RE HEARING ALL THE STORIES ABOUT THE BALLOT OFFICERS. WELL THE STAFF AT THIS DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT I'M A PARENT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER MY SON IS L. A. COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS. AND IT'S TOUGH FOR HIM YOU KNOW HE'S BEEN ON THE DEPARTMENT ALMOST EIGHT OR NINE YEARS. AND HE'S NOT A MURDER HE'S NOT A RACIST. HE'S A GOOD PERSON THIS UP TO DO THE JOB PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES OVER RUNNING AWAY FROM THE ANGER THE EVIL IN THIS WORLD HE'S RUNNING TOWARDS IT TO PROTECT US AND GUIDE US. AND I SEE IT IN HIS EYES NOW FROM TIME TO TIME ASSUME. IT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR ME IS. WHEN I'M WITH THEM OVER THE WEEKENDS A TIME BEFORE I COME BACK UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO. I HOPE THAT ISN'T THE LAST TIME I SEE MY SON. AND YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE WE DO SOME LEGISLATION. TO FIX THINGS I THINK WE MIGHT GET WORSE FOR OFFICERS BECAUSE NOW. THEY HAD DURING THE TRANSFER GOING TO SECOND GUESS THEMSELVES. SHOULD I STOP THAT PERSON SHOULD I NOT ARREST THIS PERSON BECAUSE IF I DO I'M GOING TO BE CONSIDERED A RACIST. BUT TAKE OUT MY GOD WHY DON'T TO COME AGAIN BECAUSE ALL THIS GUY'S GOING TO KILL ME BECAUSE I'M BLACK OR BROWN. NOW MY SON'S LIKE. BECAUSE OF THAT I JUST HOPE THAT HE DOESN'T DIE IN THE LINE OF DUTY AS HE MAY HAVE SECOND GUESSED HIMSELF. BECAUSE HE DON'T WANT TO BE LABELED THAT MURDER OR THAT RACES. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT THAT'S PUT ON THEM. THE FEELS LIKE MAYBE WE ARE ANTI POLICE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT. BUT THE IN IMPRESSION OUT THERE ON THE STREET FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT MAYBE WE ARE. ARE HERE TO MY SON I SEE IT IN HIS EYES AT TIMES I'VE BEEN WITH THEM. BEFORE HE GOES TO WORK THEN I CAN KIND OF SEE THAT WARRANTS CONCERN ABOUT AS YOU LEAVES BECAUSE- I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO COME HOME. HE PUTS THE BALLOT JOHN HE PUTS THE BEST ON PROTECT HIMSELF IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING THIS DIFFICULT SO I WAS REMOVED ALONG WITH THESE BILLS AND OTHERS I JUST HOPE THAT WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT. IT REALLY WHAT'S BEST FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST ONE SIDED. SO AT THAT ARE SELF CONCERNS AND ISSUES AND ALL I CAN HOPE AND SAY IS THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AS WE DO LEGISLATION THAT MAKE SURE% THAT'S FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER RODRIGUEZ. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. WE'RE LONG OVERDUE TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM TOO OFTEN WE SEE POLICE OFFICERS ESCAPE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE VIOLENCE THEY COMMIT WHETHER IT BE BY A GUN CHILL COLD OR MISUSE OF CALIFORNIA LAW. LET'S BE CLEAR. IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IS BROKEN THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW. IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IF AN OFFICER MISBEHAVES OR DONE SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE THERE'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. DOES A POLICE REVIEW BOARD THERE IS SOMETIMES IN LA WE HAVE POLICE COMMISSION. WE HAVE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL WE HAVE DAY CALIFORNIA CITY ATTORNEY WITH CITY ATTORNEY D. A GRAND JURIES ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND SOMETIMES A FERAL DOJ TO HAS TO INTERCEDE WHEN WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BAD OFFICER. WE HAVE ALL OF THAT. AND WE STILL HERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND WE STILL NOT GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM OF ELIMINATING BAD OFFICERS. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN MANY OF THESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS ISSUES WE'RE STILL ONE OF THE LAST FEW STATES TO NOT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS IN PLACE TO REMOVE POLICE OFFICERS. PEACE OFFICER STATUS AS A MIXED RESULT IN MISCONDUCT. ESTABLISHMENT SEEN SUCH A TIMELY COMMONSENSE LAW WAS SIGNAL TO CALIFORNIANS THAT ALL OFFICERS MUST CARRY OUT THEIR JOB PROPERLY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS MAJOR REFORM IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE INSURE. BOTH ADVOCATES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER. AS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY I HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES. BOTH SIDES LET'S BE VERY CLEAR BOTH SIDES ONE ELIMINATE BAD OFFICERS. I TO AS IT AFRICAN AMERICAN FATHER TO AFRICAN AMERICAN SONS ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THEY GET HOME EVERY NIGHT. JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE IS CONCERNED THAT HIS SON GETS HOME EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER SAID THAT ALL OF OUR SON. COULD COME HOME SAFELY EVERY NIGHT THAT THERE IS NO MISUNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE CLEAR RULES TO THE SOMEBODY DISOBEYS THE LAW NO MATTER TO HAVE A BAD WEATHER NOT THEY DON'T HAVE A BADGE. THAT THEY ARE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. LET'S REMEMBER THE S. B. TWO WAS INITIALLY SILENT FOR EXAMPLE ON A TRAINING FOR ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS. AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. ENSURED THAT AS A- AS A MATTER FACT THAT THERE ARE. BEING ABLE TO BE TRAINED NOW ALL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS MUST TAKE A FORTY HOUR TRAINING COURSE. ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS USE OF FORCE STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND LOCAL DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NOT JUST A RANDOM GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE BROUGHT TOGETHER THEIR TRAIN SO THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB SO YOU DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE. SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE FAIRNESS DO WE WANT. JUST BE BILL CREATES A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT IS THE FIRST STEP IN REBUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST. ADDRESS B. TWO OFFICES THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION ARE ENTITLED TO A FULL. EVIDENTIARY HEARING. DEMANDING FOR MORE WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE VICTIMS OF POLICE ABUSE LET'S BE CLEAR THIS BILL HAS ALL THE PROTECTIONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS AND FOR MEMBERS WHO ARE A LITTLE RETICENT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IN HERE. TO ENSURE THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT DO THE RIGHT THING THEY'RE NOT PROTECTIONS IN HERE TO ENSURE. THAT THEY DON'T GET RAILROADED THEY ARE UNJUSTLY UNFAIRLY PROSECUTED. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN FORTY SIX OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN DECERTIFICATION LOS I SUPPORT SB TWO. AND CREATION OF A STATE WIDE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR PEACE OFFICE FOLLOWING THE CONVICTION OF CERTAIN SERIOUS CRIMES AMER STOCK MISCONDUCT. LOOK THIS IS THE BEGINNING. THIS TO BE VERY BEGINNING. AND IS NOT THE END OF ROOTING OUT BAD POLICE OFFICERS IN OUR COMMUNITY THIRTY SECOND GETTING. THIS IS THE TIME THAT WE TAKE ACTION SO WE CAN START THIS PROCESS TO MAKE IT MORE FAIR BUT MOST IMPORTANT WE GET THOSE BAD OFFICERS OFF THE STREET I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR AND- I RISE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT WHY I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AS PROSECUTORS WE NEED TO RELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE CASES AND FAIRLY ENFORCED LAW. WE CAN'T DO OUR JOBS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO RELY ON CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS WHO WE WORK WITH CLOSELY AS WITNESSES FOR INVESTIGATIONS. OFFICERS WITH THE HISTORY OF MISCONDUCT OR FALSIFYING RECORDS CAN HAVE THEIR CREDIBILITY IMPEACHED AT EVERY TRIAL GOING FORWARD THIS UNDERMINES POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF TRIALS. I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM POMONA ABOUT. HIS SON. HIS HEART FULL PERSPECTIVE. I THINK WE ARE ALL INCREDIBLY SYMPATHETIC. ABOUT THAT PERSPECTIVE. AND WE ALL KNOW. WITHOUT EVER HAVING MET YOUR SON WE BELIEVE IN HIS INTEGRITY WE BELIEVE IN HIS HONOR. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT OFFICERS WITH THE PROBLEMATIC BACKGROUNDS HARNISH. THE HONOR AND THE INTEGRITY. OF THOSE OFFICERS LIKE YOUR SON. THAT IS WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR CHIU. MR LACKEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS IS A SURPRISE COULD THIS BILL CAME UP TODAY- BUT IT'S WHERE THEY- OF DISCUSSION ON THIS IS A VERY VERY POWERFUL ISSUE. AND ONE THAT WE NEED TO GET RIGHT. WELL I WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE AS A- CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON IS SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER BEING IN SUPERVISION. INTEGRITY TO THE BADGE IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU HAVE EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S ONLY WAY. AND SO DO WE NEED A CERTIFICATION PROCESS OF COURSE WE DO. BUT SOMETIMES OUR MOTION HELPS DEFINE WHAT WE SEE AS FAIR AND UNFAIR AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO JUST STEP BACK FROM YOUR EMOTIONALCOMMITMENT FOR JUST A MINUTE. AND THAT YOU CONSIDER. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THIS BILL. IT'S GETTING CLOSE AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME ATTEMPTS. TO MOVE TOWARDS FAIRNESS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S- IT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE AND THIS IS A VERY VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE. THAT I THINK HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD. BY MANY WHO WEAR THE BADGE WE ALL SUFFER FROM THAT ALL OF US SOME MORE THAN OTHERS AND I WOULD SAY. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT IN THIS ROOM ARE MORE AFFORDABLE. TOO BAD LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT ALSO MEANS DISENGAGE ONE FOR SENATE AND THAT IS A NATURAL RESULT TO UNFAIR LEGISLATION IS DISENGAGEMENT. THINK OF IT IF YOU ARE A BADGE HOW WOULD YOU FEEL. WELL LET ME JUST TELL YOU. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE OVER SB TWO IN ITS CURRENT STATE IS THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. OFFENSES FOR WHICH AN OFFICER MAY BE SUSPENDED FOR DECERTIFIED BY POST. WE ALL ARE VAGUELY DESCRIBED WE ALL AGREE THAT MISCONDUCT SHORT OF A FELONY CONVICTION SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DECERTIFICATION BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT BEFORE WE EXPOSE AN OFFICER TO POTENTIALLY BEING BANNED. IN THEIR PROFESSION BUT THE DEFINITION BE LIMITED TO THOSE OFFENSES WHICH DEMONSTRATE UP FITNESS TO BE AN OFFICER. SB CHOOSE DEFINITION IS QUITE BROAD. IT INCLUDES UNIFIED TERM BIAS ON THE BASIS OF HOUSING STATUS. IT INCLUDES FAILURE TO INTERCEDE AND EXCESSIVE FORCE. THE PERMITS POSTED TO FIND ANY ACT. THE VIOLATES THE LAW AS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. I BELIEVE AT LEAST ONE SANCTIONS SHORT OF THE CERTIFICATION OR SUSPENSION ARE NOT AVAILABLE BUT THE DEFINITION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO MORE EGREGIOUS ACTS. WHICH THEMSELVES OF ALL CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. ABUSE OF AUTHORITY HER DISHONESTY THIS BILL GOES WAY BEYOND THAT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE DO NEED A JUST A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. BUT WE ALSO NEED THAT TO BE FAIR. IF IT'S NOT FAIR. WE'VE WE'VE BROUGHT DISCREDIT TO THIS INSTITUTION TO OURSELVES AND WE SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR OFFICERS. THAT WE DON'T CARE. SO AS FOR NOW. MEMBERS IF YOU'RE GONNA BE RAISING YOUR MICROPHONES PLEASE DO SO NOW. MR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM HONORED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO TODAY. AND- I JUST WANT TO OFFER A REFLECTION UPON WHY WE'RE HERE YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE THREAD OF HISTORY RUNS TO THIS CHAMBER. WE WERE ALL A GREAT MOMENT ARM PERSONAL HER SHOES WERE RELUCTANT TO IT. BUT THE THREAT OF HER THREE RUNS TO OUR DELIBERATIONS HERE. WHEN I WAS EIGHT. I WAS A WEIRD LITTLE EIGHT YEAR OLD AND I WROTE A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. THAT ADVOCATES TESTIFIES HOW WEIRD I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD RIGHT THE PRESIDENT. VERY IMPORTANT PRESENT ONE OF HIS COMMENTS ACTUALLY THAT I'VE ALWAYS BROUGHT WITH ME IN PUBLIC SERVICE. IS TO GOVERN IS TO CHOOSE. THAT IS THE GREAT AN AWFUL RESPONSIBLE TO THE POLLS ON EACH OF US TO GOVERN IS TO CHOOSE. THAT IS A HEAVY METAL THE BARE UNDER OATH OF OFFICE. AND THE TIME TO WHICH SAYS EXERCISES SOMETIME BETWEEN AND SOMETIMES OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE. WE SIT HERE IN THIS CHAMBER AND I'VE OFTEN. REFLECTED UPON WHAT IS THE PIECE OF PAPER THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS HOLDEN IS HANDS. I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THIS PAIN IS ONE OF SEVEN THE ORIGINAL PAINTED AND LYFT BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED. SO I SORT OF THINK THE CANDIDATE FOR ME IS THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. MIGHT BE TO GETTYSBURG ADDRESS WAS ONLY A COUPLE OUTSTANDING PIECES OF PAPER USUALLY REMEMBERED FOR. AND OF COURSE AT STANFORD HE WAS AND A PRESIDENT OF EPIC DIMENSION IN A TIME OF EPIC CHALLENGE. AND STEERED A COURSE TO CHALLENGE US. TO MOVE INTO A BETTER FUTURE AS A NATION. AND I SORT OF FEEL THAT IS WHERE WE COME IN THIS MOMENT. I USE MY SUMMER BREAK TO ENJOY READING. I READ WILLIAM SAFIRE'S GREAT BOOK FREEDOM NINE HUNDRED PAGES ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND EVENTS THAT LED TO THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. AND MORE RECENTLY I JUST WRAPPED UP ERNEST J. GAINES IS TREMENDOUS BOOK A GATHERING OF OLD MEN. WHICH IS ABOUT. RELATIONS IN THE SOUTH. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES I COMMITTED TO YOUR READING BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE THREAT OF HISTORY DOES RUN THROUGH THIS CHAMBERS. I THINK IT IS OUR MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE. AND I ACTUALLY FEEL WE ARE AT A MOMENT WHEN. WE NEED A MODEL. CHOOSING A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT IS WHAT THE ALLEGORY ON THE WEST PORTICOS ALL ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME SAY THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE WEST PORTICO UP THERE YOU GOT THAT GRIZZLY BEAR ATTACKING A GUY ON HORSEBACK. BUT INDEPENDENT AT THE GRIZZLY BEAR HAD BEEN SUBDUED BY ATHENA. REPRESENT GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO COMMUNITY. TRYING TO SUBDUE THOSE PAIRS THAT ARISE IN THE LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS IS OUR JOB. WE DO IT SIMPLY BY OUR CHOICE EXERCISE THE GREY METAL RESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERN IS TO CHOOSE BUT WE DO WITH PARTNERS. AND I KNOW THIS IS WHAT MISTER BRADFORD WITH THE SUPPORT OF TONI ATKINS AND OTHERS. HAVE LABOR TOWARDS. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR LABOR. I WANT TO CHOOSE HISTORY I'M AND I ON THE S. B. TO URGE YOU TO JOIN. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY MR MURATSUCHI. YOU. ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH. COLLEAGUES AS A FORMER STATE PROSECUTOR. I SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. I REPRESENT. COMMUNITIES LIKE TORRANCE. WHERE WE SUPPORT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ME TALKING ABOUT DE FUNDING THE POLICE. BECAUSE. WE SUPPORT. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR PROTECTING OUR FAMILIES OUR NEIGHBORHOODS OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO THIS BILL. I'VE BEEN ANGST THING OVER THIS BILL FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. BECAUSE. SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS ALREADY WE HAVE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT. THAT WE NEED A PROCESS TO GET RID OF BAD COPS. WE NEED. TO GET RID OF THE PROCESSING TO GET RID OF BAD COPS A BOOK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. AS OUR CALLING FROM LANCASTER ONE OF THE FEW CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOLKS ON THIS FLOOR STATED THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR FOR. ALL OF OUR- MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. OTHERWISE IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THEM. MY REVIEW OF THIS. BILL ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AMENDMENTS.% THERE ARE CONTINUE TO BE A LOT OF FAULTS WITH THIS BILL I GUESS I CONTINUE TO SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE BIASED NATURE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. BUT AFTER REVIEWING WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE. THE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF REVIEW THAT IS PROVIDED IN SB TWO. THE FIRST DAYS. THAT POST. DETERMINES WHETHER A COMPLAINT- REPORT OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN OFFICER ENGAGED IN SERIOUSNESS MISCONDUCT. THE SECOND PHASE THE POST HAS AN INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION. DIGITAL INVESTIGATION AND IF NECESSARY CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND IF ONLY AND ONLY IF THE POST DIVISION DETERMINES THAT THERE IS REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR DECERTIFICATION BENNETT THEN BRING THE CASE THE ADVISORY BOARD. THE ADVISORY BOARD THEN GET THE CHANCE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE INVESTIGATIVE THE DIVISION PRESENTS TO THEM. AND DATE MAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATION. TO THE FULL POST COMMISSION. THE FULL POST COMMISSION. OF TWELVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OUT OF SEVENTEEN MEMBERS REVIEWS THE POST INVESTIGATION. AND THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECIDES WHETHER TO ADOPT OR REJECT IT. IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS. PROVIDES THE OPTIONS NOT ONLY OF DECERTIFYING THE OFFICERS BUT ALSO OF SUSPENDING THE CERTIFICATION WHICH ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE TO ME. THAT THERE SHOULD BE DEGREES. OF DISCIPLINE IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ALL OR NOTHING PROPOSITION. IF THE FULL POST COMMISSION DECIDES TO SEEK DISCIPLINE. THE OFFICER IS STILL ENTITLED TO A FULL AND FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING. BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON WHETHER THE DECERTIFICATION IS WARRANTED. AND F. AFTER THAT IF THE OFFICER IS STILL NOT SATISFIED. THEY STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN APPEAL OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE. HEARING'S DECISION AND SUPERIOR COURT THIRTY SECONDS SO. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL I WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE TAKEN MORE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A FAIR PROCESS. BUT I DO BELIEVE. THAT WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE BEEN TOO MANY INCIDENTS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE STOP. SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY THE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE SEPARATE THE GOOD COPS FROM THE BAD COPS. AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO. MR LOW. MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. ALL RIGHTS IS HERE AND OBSERVATION EXPERIENCE AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT. I ALSO COME FROM A FAMILY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS MADE NO I LIVE WITH MY BROTHER BACK IN THE DISTRICT. AND HE'S BEEN A POLICE OFFICER IN OAKLAND AND CURRENTLY SERVING IN SAN JOSE. AND JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU THE EXPERIENCES IN WHICH HE KNOCKS. ON MY DOOR. AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FINISHING A SHIFT WITH PUNCTURE WOUNDS IN HIS HANDS. ASKING ME HAVE YOU ABANDONED US. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES DOES THE MEDIA COVER THE EXPERIENCES OF WHAT IS LIFE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ON THE STREETS PROTECTING ANSWERING EVERY CALL FOR SERVICE. WHEN ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NEED THEM. THIS IS VERY PERSONAL. AND I OFTENTIMES WONDER AND RECALL THE EXPERIENCE AND WHICH FOR OFFICERS WHEN HE WAS IN OAKLAND WERE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. AND NOT BE ABLE TO CONTACT HIM. WHAT THAT FEELING IS LIKE EACH AND EVERY DAY FOR MEMBERS WHO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM PROUDLY TO STAND UP. AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITY TO PROTECT AND SERVE WITH DIGNITY AND DISTINCTION. AT THE SAME TIME I'VE ALSO TAKEN THE TIME TO MEET WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. I FELT THE PAIN AND AGONY. I'VE LISTENED I AM ALSO. GOING ON RIDE ALONGS WITH POLICE OFFICERS I PARTICIPATED IN SIMULATIONS I HAVE CONVERSATION WITH AYE POLICE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE CHALLENGES. THEY'RE DEALING WITH. COLLEAGUES MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN MARCHING WITH US AS WELL WE'VE SEEN THE MARCHING WITH US IN BLACK LIVES MATTER WE SEE IN THE MARCHING AND STOPPING ASIAN HEY WE DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE MARCHING AND GAY PRIDE. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE. NO LONGER WELCOMES. AND THE INVITATION IS RESCINDED FOR THEM NOT TO MARCH IN PRIDE IN UNIFORM THEY STILL MARCH WITH US. THAT IS THE TYPE OF DEDICATION MEMBERS HAVE. I'M OF THE SAME TIME WE TALK ABOUT STRENGTHENING. INSTITUTION. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE WEED OUT. BAD COPS. AND SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTION. THIS BILL IS A CONTINUATION TO RECTIFY THE INJUSTICES OF THE PAST BUT COLLEAGUES AT THE SAME TIME THE WORK IS NOT DONE IF WE TRULY CARE ABOUT REFORMING LAW ENFORCEMENT THEN WE SHOULD ADEQUATELY FUND. POST WE SHOULD ADAM GRIDLEY HELP ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MORE DIVERSITY. AND RANK AND FILE. MORE AFTER AMERICAN ASIAN PROVIDER WOMEN LGBT POLICE CHIEFS SHERIFFS. TO REFLECT OUR COMMUNITIES SO LET US NOT STOP HERE AND THINK THAT OUR JOB IS DONE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LET US ALSO NOT DEMONIZED BECAUSE THERE IS A- FEAR. ABOUT THE NOTION ABOUT FEEDING INTO THIS ABOLISHING THE POLICE AND THE POLICE ARE BAD. WHEN IN FACT WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING SAFE STREETS SAFE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE JUST LIKE US. SO LET US REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT NOT ONLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION BUT ALSO WORKING HARD. TO SAY THAT WE STAND WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES AND SAYING. WE STAND WITH YOU WE WANT TO HELP. ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MR LOW THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE SUPPORT FOR SB TWO. THIS WILL SURPRISE NO ONE SINCE I'VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION. WE KNOW GREAT MAJORITY POLICE OFFICERS FAITHFULLY PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. UNFORTUNATELY AT THE SAME TIME A FEW BAD ACTORS JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RISE TO THE LEVEL OF KILLINGS LIKE GEORGE FLOYD- LIZA MCCAIN. AN OFFICER WHO STANDS BY WHILE A FOLLOW OFFICERS SOUGHT TO MEMBER THE PUBLIC. IS JEOPARDIZING OUR SAFETY. AN OFFICER WHO LIES ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A TRAFFIC STOP OR AN ARREST IS JEOPARDIZING OUR SAFETY. AN OFFICER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMAN UNDER COLOR OF AUTHORITY IS JEOPARDIZING OUR SAFETY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OFFICERS WHO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE KEPT OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S WHAT THIS DE CERTIFICATION DOES ABOUT. IT HAS A CLEAR AND FAIR REVIEW PROCESS WITH HALF A DOZEN LEVELS OF REVIEW. BEFORE AN ACCUSED OFFICERS DEFERRED THE CERTIFICATION IS FINAL. AND THAT IS FAR MORE DUE PROCESS THAN GEORGE FORD GOT. THAT'S FAR MORE DO DUE PROCESS. IS TO FIND CLARK THAT. ESTABLISHING CONSEQUENCES FOR OFFICIAL MISDEEDS BY POLICE. SHOULD NOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS HURTING PLEASE IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT'S STRENGTHENS OUR PUBLIC'S IT STRENGTHENS OUR PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM THIS THIS CERTIFICATION BILL WILL DO THAT. IT IS ANOTHER CALIFORNIA MILESTONE AND I ASK YOUR VOTE FOR S. B. LAST YEAR I VOTED FOR SB TWO. THANK YOU MISS BAKER. THANK YOU MEMBERS DR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THIS ROBUST DEBATE AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR COMING AND GIVING HIS SUPPORT IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO EVERYONE WHO HAS FOUGHT SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS A REALITY. I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. FIRST ABOUT THE ADVISORY BOARD. SO YOU KNOW REMEMBER THE ADVISORY BOARD TO SEVEN COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES AND TWO MEMBERS FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE TWO OFFICERS ONE LAWYER. TO FROM AN ACADEMIC OR NONPROFIT INSTITUTION. TO FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS INTO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND SO I THINK THAT IT IS. UNFAIR OF US TO ASSUME. THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE BY. ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW I WANT EVERYONE TO REMEMBER THAT THE POST COMMISSION WHICH IS THE SUPERMAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT THEY START AND IN THIS PROCESS THE ADVISORY BOARD IS JUST THERE TO GIVE ADVICE ON WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SHOULD BE TO CERTIFIED BASED OFF OF A PROCESS THAT POST INITIATED AND POST AT THE END OF THE DAY WILL DETERMINE IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. THE SECOND THAT WAS BROUGHT UP REVOLVED AROUND THE ISSUE OF RETROACTIVE DECERTIFICATION SO THE COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY TO RETROACTIVELY REVIEW CERTAIN MISCONDUCT RELATED TO DEADLY USE OF FORCE. SEXUAL ASSAULT OR DISHONESTY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CERTIFICATION. IF THAT HAPPENED BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT OFFICER WAS NOT CHARGED AT THE TIME THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE TO NOW DECERTIFY THAT OFFICER BUT SHE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSION DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO REVIEW THAT FILE. AFTER REVIEWING THE FILE. ONCE AGAIN NOT PROCESS START THAT POST WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE. TO THEN GO DOWN THAT SIX STAGE PROCESS THAT MY COLLEAGUE WENT THROUGH. SO NOT JUST ANYBODY TWENTY THIRTY YEARS LATER CAN HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEW. AND FINALLY THE ISSUE OF MISCONDUCT AND HOW TO DEFINE IT. ONCE AGAIN POST IS DEFINING WHAT MISCONDUCT IS. NOT NECESSARILY WRITTEN IN STONE BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PUTTING OUT THERE FOR THEIR DEFINITION OF WHAT BAY DEFINE AS MUCH CONTACT. SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS ALL THE CO AUTHORS THE SPONSORS AND ALL OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS BILL. THE TIME IS NOW TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE PROCESS OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO BRING CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH FORTY OTHER THE FORTY SIX OTHER STATES.
