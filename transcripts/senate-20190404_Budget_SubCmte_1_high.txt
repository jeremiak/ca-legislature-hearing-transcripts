EDUCATION FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNCERTAIN -- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND START -- TO I GUESS IS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF ONE FOR RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE ISSUE NUMBER SIX FIRST BECAUSE I HAVE A COLLEAGUE PRESENT -- TO WHO WILL NEED TO PRESENT AND MAY HAVE OTHER PLACES TO BE ISSUE SIX IS A NEW CAMPUS STUDIES SO. THERE HUESO -- SIR. PLACE OF HONOR. GOOD LUCK GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A LOT ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS [inaudible] THE COMMITTEE -- THIS IS REGARDING A TWO MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING IN -- PROPOSAL -- FOR THE POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN CHULA VISTA AND MY DISTRICT AND SOUTH SAN DIEGO. THIS -- WOULD ACTIVATE A THIRTY A THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE ACRE CITY OWNED. OF PARCEL. THAT IS WITH THAT HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY SET ASIDE AND STONED AND PREPARED FOR UNIVERSITY THAT YOU'D THE CHILL. CITY CHILVERS TO HAS BEEN WORKING -- VERY HARD FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO ATTRACT A STATE UNIVERSITY OF SOME SORT THE UC OR STATE. UNIVERSITY FOR THE PURPOSES OF SERVING THE SOUTH BAY. SOUTH BAY SAN DIEGO HAS A POPULATION OF A MILLION PEOPLE. WITH ABSOLUTELY NO A UNIVERSITY INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE A A A A VERY -- SUCCESSFUL. COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF PROGRAM BUT EVEN THAT PROGRAM. A HAS A WHOPPING NINETEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS -- THE THERE WAS A FACILITY THAT WAS BUILT ADJACENT TO THE BORDER WAS CRITICIZED WHY THEY BUILDING AT THEIR IT WAS -- 80% AND ROLLED -- THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE THE THE CAMPUS WAS EVEN COMPLETED. THIS IS -- AN AREA THAT HAS A AS I MENTIONED A MILLION PEOPLE. BUT ALSO WITH AN ADJACENT -- CITY JUST TO THE SOUTH. LARGELY CONCENTRATED ALONG THE BORDER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ALSO IN THE THE CITY OF OF OF THE ONE OF WHICH IS CLOSELY APPROACHING. A TWO MILLION RESIDENTS -- F. QUICKLY APPROACHING TWO MILLION RESIDENTS SO THIS IS AN AREA THAT WOULD NOT ONLY BE WELL SERVED BY A UNIVERSITY BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE WELL SERVED WITH. A UNIVERSITY IN THIS AREA TO IT IS -- OF THAT. WHAT I CALL A GLOBALIZED COMMUNITY ON AREA THAT IS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY? THAT WOULD -- CREATE A CAMPUS IN AN AREA WHERE WE CURRENTLY IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE NO CAMPUSES NEAR THE BORDER. NEAR ALL THAT INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR -- AN AREA THAT IS IS VERY THRIVING ECONOMIC PLAYBOOK AND THAT IS A GLOBAL LIFE THAT IS -- INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THIS SITE IS -- OF A VERY STRATEGIC SIDE AND AND AND WITHIN THE THE THE CITY'S AREA IT. AND ALSO IS ADJACENT. ON ELITE TRAINING FACILITY THOSE THOSE UP -- BUILT TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO OLYMPIC ATHLETES THIS FACILITY IS NOT ONLY GROWING IS IT SEE MORE PEOPLE COME TO THAT AREA FOR FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND IT WOULD MAKE A A WONDERFUL -- PARTNER WITH A UNIVERSITY IN THAT AREA -- TWO THIRDS OF HIGH SCHOOL. STUDENTS GRADUATE IN A SOUTH BAY. ATTEND LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES TWO THIRDS. THAT IS JUST AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOT ONLY STAIN LOCALLY IN SAN DIEGO BUT GOING TO LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND AND WE REALLY NEED A FEEDER UNIVERSITY ALL OUR UNIVERSITIES IN IN SAN DIEGO ARE OVER AND ROLLED THEIR IMPACTED. HARD TO GET COURSE WORK AT SAN DIEGO STATE. I IS SOMETIMES IT TAKES US STUDENTS IS SENDING A STATE UP TO SIX YEARS TO GRADUATE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING COURSE WORK. THIS IS A UNIVERSITY WOULD BRING WITH IT -- IT INVESTMENT. TO HELP US -- CREATE MORE MORE SLOTS FOR STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO MAKE. UP THE UNIVERSITY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH BAY. IF YOU VISIT SAN DIEGO IT'S VERY HARD I MEAN WE'RE BUILDING A TROLLEY TO YOU SEE AS THE AND WE BUILT TROLLEY. TO TO THE A TO SEND YOU A STATE BUT IT IS CHILL OF ESTÃ¡ AND IN THE AREA IN THE SOUTH BAY THERE REALLY IS NO ACCESS TO A TROLLEY THERE IN THAT AREA. AND IT'S A ALTHOUGH THEY'RE WORKING ON CREATING A MORE. EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. IT IS STILL AN AREA THAT IS -- NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THESE SERVICES IN THE UNIVERSITIES FOR THESE KIDS ARE VERY HARD TO ACCESS. THIS WOULD BE OF A WONDERFUL THING FOR ALL OF SEND YOU WILL COUNTY WHAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING. FOR OF THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALL I'M ASKING HERE IS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS THAT WE CONSIDER THIS. THAT THESE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING -- EARMARKED FOR OTHER STUDY OF A OF A OF ANOTHER UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY ALSO INCLUDE THIS. AS AN OPTION OF BECAUSE I THINK -- IT'LL LEADER IF WE DO INCLUDED -- TO RANK VERY HIGH AS A WONDERFUL OPTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. TO BUILD A SOMETHING SOMEWHERE WHERE. WE WILL HAVE A HIGH POPULATION OF STUDENTS WANTING TO ATTEND. AND OTHER STUDENTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WANTING -- TO ATTEND AS WELL. SO THANK YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LOVE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS WILL I WOULD NOTE THAT -- YOU SEE YOU SEE ISSUE SAN DIEGO RATHER -- APPEARS TO BE AN IMPACTED CAMPUS WITH THEM FOR OVER ALMOST. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND A STUDENTS AT LEAST THAT'S THE DATA THAT -- THAT WE WERE PROVIDED IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE THIS MUST BE SEE ISSUES SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO STATE OF HAS SOME. WHAT THEY CALL OFF CAMPUS CENTERS WITH I WOULD CALL THEM SATELLITE CAMPUSES MAY BE IN IMPERIAL VALLEY CALEXICO IN BROAD? OF FAIRLY SMALL AND DO YOU CENTER YOU CONTEMPLATE THAT YOUR STUDY WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING -- A SATELLITE TO EXPANDING A SATELLITE CAMPUS PERHAPS ON STEROIDS MUCH LARGER THAN THE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE FD ENROLLMENT AT IMPERIAL VALLEY CALEXICO. THE SATELLITE CAMPUS PERHAPS THAT YOU LIVE IS TO IN ADDITION -- TO STUDYING THE POSSIBILITY OF A FULL FULL SCALE CSU CAMPUS OF THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL -- WE ACTUALLY WORKED VERY HARD TO GET SENDING A STATE NOT TO CLOSE OUR SATELLITE CAMPUS THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING CONSIDERED -- ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO -- WITH WITH SOME OF THE BUDGET CUTS AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE UNIVERSITY WAS FACING BACK THEN [inaudible] IT. SEND YOUR STATE WITH THEIR SATELLITE CAMPUS HAS BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT A LOT OF STUDENTS FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY. TO ATTEND SAN DIEGO STATE A LOT OF MOST OF THE STUDENTS FROM. OF IMPERIAL COUNTY THAT -- GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE YOU GROUP WILL GRADUATE FROM SAN DIEGO STATE SO IT IS. A ONE OF FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS BEEN FORMED. AND WE'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING SENEGAL STATE -- TO PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO THE CAMPUS AND TO IMPERIAL COUNTY KEEP IT OPEN PUT MORE RESOURCES THERE BECAUSE THERE IS A VERY HEALTHY -- YOUNG POPULATION AUTHOR THE BE VERY WELL SERVED BY THAT AND THIS PARTICULAR ONE IT'S THAT. YOU'RE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW IS ONE IN CHULA VISTA -- THE ONE THAT -- I THINK THAT. THAT -- IT IS VERY PART OF A SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY PRACTICABLE. VERY ACHIEVABLE. IS -- THIS FACILITY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY BUILT AND BUILT AND IT'S NOT JUST. A VACANT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE ACRE PARCEL IT'S A PARTIAL THAT HAS ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE ROADS -- YEAH I MEAN PLUMBING ELECTRICAL AND I MEAN EVERYTHING IS IS IS IT CONNECTED TO THIS PARCEL. IN A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY ACHIEVABLE TO BUILD. A UNIVERSITY QUITE AFFORDABLY THEIR AND IT WOULD. OF COURSE BE OF AGAIN IN AN AREA OF A MILLION PEOPLE WOULDN'T. IT WILL IT THEY WOULD BE AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION ONCE IT OPENS UP YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT OF PEOPLE APPLYING TO GO THERE SO. MUCH CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE STUDIED BOTH OF FULL SCALE CAMPUS AND ALSO -- AS I SAID A SATELLITE CAMPUS PERHAPS ON STEROIDS IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BUREAUCRACY THAT TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE. SEPARATE UNIVERSITIES BUT YOU COULD CERTAINLY ELIMINATE THAT COST ELEMENT IF YOU SIMPLY DOES WHICH TO SOME EXTENT. IF YOU DID AS A LARGER SATELLITE CAMPUS TO SERVICE THE STUDENT POPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN CHULA VISTA I AGREE I AGREE I THINK THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS MISTER SHERMAN. WE'LL GO WE'LL GO TO WORK ON THAT SIR THANK YOU THANKS FOR PRESENTING. WE HAVE A PANEL ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW CAMPUS STUDY -- WHAT WE CALL OF THE PANEL AND FINISH OFF ISSUE NUMBER SIX AT THIS POINT IN TIME? AND WHILE THEY'RE COMING UP LET'S DO SOMETHING NOVEL AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM. THEY'RE ALL HERE THERE LEYVA. YOUR THURMOND. OKAY IF I COULD ASK MY PANELISTS TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR EUROPE. MY NAME IS RAINSTORM I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. THE STORM THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BY SEN ONE I'M ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR WITH CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS KIRK THANK YOU. AUSTIN HOUSE AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MISTER STEVE HAS THANK YOU WHO WANTS TO START THIS HURT. THANK YOU THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF A POTENTIAL CAMPUS. IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY LIKELY AND STOCKTON. THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE PROPOSED REVIEW WOULD INCLUDE A STUDY THAT EXAMINES. WHETHER A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN THE REGION IS WARRANTED. AND OUTLINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR INITIAL PLANNING. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE MAY REVISION IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. YES SIR ALEJO. THIS IS THIS ISSUE IS MENTIONED IN THE GOVERNOR'S SUMMARY OF THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET. BUT IS NOT BEEN INCLUDED YET IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AS YOU JUST HEARD WILL. LEGISLATURE WILL BE EXPECTING. LANGUAGE AT THE MAY REVISE. IN THINKING ABOUT THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- COUPLE ISSUES TO CONSIDER. OF THE FACT THE MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING FUNDS FOR STUDY SUGGESTS THE GOVERNOR. WOULD LIKE TO ASSESS CERTAIN CRITERIA CERTAIN FACTORS BEFORE COMMITTING TO A NEW CAMPUS THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT YET CLARIFIED WHICH FACTORS HE WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER. A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ASKED OUR OFFICE -- TO TO ASSESS WHETHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WAS JUSTIFIED BASED ON ONE KEY FACTOR AND THAT WAS. PROJECTED ENROLLMENT AND PHYSICAL CAPACITY OF EXISTING CAMPUSES AND IN THAT REPORT WE FOUND THAT THE STATE COULD ACCOMMODATE GROWTH IN MOST REGIONS INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OF BY BUILDING OUT EXISTING CAMPUSES. THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION MATE MIGHT HAVE OTHER FACTORS IN MIND -- OTHER CRITERIA TO CONSIDER WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUTING TIME FOR STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OF A LOCAL OR REGIONAL AREA NO LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT FACTORS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IN MIND WHEN A JESSE. ASSESSING THIS PROPOSAL. LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY WILL ALSO WANT TO KNOW A LOT MORE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THIS TW MILLION DOLLARS. WOULD BE SPENT WHAT THE SCOPE WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IS A PROPOSED TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FACILITY PLANS AS WELL OR FINANCING PLANS PLANS TO BUILD OUT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS IS IT FROM FIRE MENTAL REVIEWS. SO LEGISLATURE OLDEST BE WANT TO WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS WHAT IT ENTAILS. AND WHAT THE DELIVERABLES WILL BE. THANK YOU. THE RAIN STORM AGAIN FROM C. ISSUE I THINK ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT FROM -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE LA -- WHEN HE SAID THAT WE AGREE WITH THIS IS THAT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT WE BELIEVE THAT WE DO HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES THAT? WE COULD BUILD OUT ARE ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND ADD ADDITIONAL ROMANCE IN OUR EXISTING TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ONE WHO AGREED -- TO STUDYING SOME NEW CAMPUSES WE HAVE A LONG ESTABLISHED POLICY THAT THE BOARD EMPLOYEES. IN REVIEWING WHETHER OUR CAMPUS SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE DEVELOP THERE'S A LOT OF CRITERIA THAT ARE LAID OUT IN. IN IN OUR POLICIES -- THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT WITH THAT MONEY IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT MONEY WE WOULD DO ALL THE WORK THAT YOU WOULD WANT US TO DO AND ANALYZE WHATEVER SCOPE WORK THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IN IN US PURSUING -- AND THEN -- I THINK JUST THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IF YOU WILL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING THIS THAN WE'RE WILLING TO DO THE WORK. OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THAT ONE THING THAT IS SOMETHING OF CONCERN TO THE C. ISSUE IN GENERAL WITH. A NEW CAMPUSES IS THAT WE DO LAUNCHER OR TAKEOVER PARTICULAR CAMPUSES OFTENTIMES WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND LITTLE BIT. COURSE BUT WE HAVE TO STARBUCKS CAMPUSES IN ORDER -- TO TO REALLY -- SUPPORT NEW CAMPUSES -- TO GET THEM TO CAPACITY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT SORT OF THING SO. IN THE PAST WE'VE YOU KNOW HAD THE DEVELOPMENT MONTEREY BAY -- WE'VE TAKEN ON THE MARITIME ACADEMY IN THE EARLY NINETIES ALSO -- I THINK SAN MARCOS WAS ANOTHER CAMPUS WHERE IT WAS KIND OF YOUR TAKE YOUR GOING FROM A CENTER SORT OF POSITION TO DEVELOPING INTO FULL BLOWN CAMPUS WILL SERVE CHANNEL ISLANDS. WAS WHEN MOST RECENT ONES. IT'S A TO GET THOSE CAMPUSES THE CAPACITY. OF FROM MAYBE NOTHING YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF RESOURCES TO GET A CAMPUS TO ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WHICH IS KIND OF OUR KIND OF BALLPARK OF WHERE WE THINK A SELF SUSTAINING UNIVERSITY CAN BE. DOES THAT INCLUDE THE CAPITAL COST IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CAPITAL COSTS OF THE OPERATING COST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T. INCLUDE OTHER CAPITAL COST MY COLLEAGUE COULD TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW PRICE TAG OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THAT BUT I WOULD I MEAN I WAS AT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WERE. GOING FIRST WHAT WE HAVE TO VIEW THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET LITTLE ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THESE OF THIS SYSTEM PLUS THE UC SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IS THE STATE WHICH BY MY MATHIS SOMEWHERE OR THE REPORTED. TOTALS ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. EIGHT TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS JUST ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SIDE NOT. TOTALING UP THE CAPITAL PROJECT -- NEEDS FOR FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. A SO WE HAVE THAT. TO THAT'S THE CONTEXT WERE OPERATING IN HERE. SO HAVING STARTED A COUPLE AT LEAST ONE OR TWO NEW CAMPUSES IN THE LAST COUPLE DECADES WHY. WHAT IS THE COST OF SETTING UP A? A NEW C. ISSUE CAMPUS ALL IN. WHAT WILL THEY THINK OF A UC MERCED I WOULD SAY BILLION DOLLARS? BILLION. IS THERE CAPITAL PLAN. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OPERATING COSTS THE LABELS AND ON TOP OF THAT YEAH WHAT WHAT I WHAT I'M REFERENCING IS GENERALLY THE OPERATING BUDGET FOR OUR CHANNEL ISLANDS CAMPUS WHICH HAS ABOUT. FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS. SO. WHEN YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS BEFORE SO WHAT CAN YOU IN LIKE ME A LITTLE BIT AS TO WHAT THE FACTORS ARE THAT YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SAY? TO THE NEW CAMPUS SOMEWHERE. WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THE ENROLLMENT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK CARE BY BOARD POLICY WHAT THE IMPACT IS TO OTHER HIGHER ITS INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA? SO DOES IT DETRACT FROM OTHER OTHER -- INSTITUTIONS LIKE AND HOW SAN DIEGO STATE IT AT ONE TIME THE IMPACT IT HAD AN OFF CAMPUS CENTER -- IN CHULA VISTA SO WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO MAINTAIN THAT AND CAN THEY MAINTAIN IT ADEQUATELY. WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PALM DESERT CAMPUS IS THE STUDENTS GOING THERE -- WANT MORE SERVICES AND OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF ADMINISTRATOR EFFICIENCIES THE HEAD OF THE HOME CAMPUS WILL SHARE RESOURCES SO IT MAY BE A FACULTY IS COMMUTING. OR COUNSELORS COMMUTING FINANCIAL A PERSON IS GOING FROM ONE CAMP THE OTHER. BUT OTHER FACTORS OF THEY WOULD CONSIDER IS. WHAT'S THE IMPACT WITH THE COMMUNITY IS A COMMUNITY WELCOMING WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO CITE THE FACILITY IN THAT COMMUNITY AS FAR AS TRAFFIC IMPACTS -- ARE ARE THERE -- IS THERE HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS WE'VE SEEN THAT IS A FACTOR. SO WILL WE BE ABLE -- TO SINCE IT'S A SELF SUPPORT PROGRAM A CONSTRUCT HOUSING IN THAT AREA FOR STUDENTS. MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM -- TO TO GET THROUGH GRADUATION AND AND RETAIN OF STUDENTS [inaudible] OF FOR THOSE HURT WHAT WITH THE ACADEMIC DEGREE PROGRAMS THEY WOULD OFFER. SO WILL THEY BE ABLE TO ACT OFFER A FULL COMPLEMENT OF DEGREE PROGRAMS WHAT DOES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFER. VERSES THE A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. SO THAT'S PART OF THE THE TYPICALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH OUR OFF CAMPUS CENTERS AS THEY WOULD OFFER UPPER DIVISION SELECT COMMITTEE COFFIN COMMITTEE COLLEGES OFFER LOWER DIVISIONS SO HOW THAT. WORKS AS WELL SUBMIT DR IN IN TERMS OF AND WE'RE TALKING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NOW IN TERMS OF YOUR STUDENT POPULATION YOUR STUDENT BASE -- WHAT PERCENTAGE GENERALLY ARE COMMUTERS AS OPPOSED TO RESIDENTIAL STUDENTS DOES IT DEPEND ON THE CAMPUS? RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE ALL OF OUR OFF CAMPUS CENTERS ARE COMMUTER CAMPUSES. ALTHOUGH THEIR PLANS IN SOME OF THE MASTER PLAN TO FIGHT HOUSING. AND THEN THE MAIN SEE ISSUE OF INSTITUTIONS. FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE OR SYMBOL TO DENOTE OR DOES IT DEPEND ON THE CAMPUS IT DOES DEPEND ON THE CAMPUS. AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF COMMUTERS AND THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING ON CAMPUS ALSO RANGES FRESNO IS ON THE LOWER SIDE. I THINK PROBABLY CLOSER 210% COMPARED TO A MARITIME ACADEMY WHERE THE REQUIRED. TO LIVE ON CAMPUS AT SAVE UPWARDS OF 50% CAPACITY. AND IF -- THE ADMINISTRATION WERE INCLINED TO ADD A ANOTHER A ANALYSIS TO THIS STUDY FOR EXAMPLE OF WHETHER IT'S A SATELLITE CAMPUS IN AN EXPANDED SATELLITE CAMPUS OR A A NEW CSU INSTITUTION IN CHULA VISTA HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH WOULD THAT ADD TO THE? PRICE TAG OF THE STUDY WOULD DOESN'T NECESSARILY DOUBLE IT FROM TWO TO FOUR MILLION OR CAN YOU ADD ANOTHER SITE TO THE STUDY. WAS IN THE TWO MILLION. OR IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOR YOU ALL TO SAY AT THIS POINT YEAH I WOULD GUESS IT WOULD NOT DOUBLE IT. IF IT WAS THE BUT BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT AREA SO AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE LAND. AND SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT IT COULD. BUT THE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE MORE THAN DOUBLE. AND INFO AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE SINCE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES HAD A PRESENCE. HAS A PRESENCE IN SAN DIEGO AND AS HAVE APPARENTLY HAD A PRESENCE IN CHULA VISTA WITH THE SATELLITE OFF CAMPUS LOCATION BEFORE. THAT MIGHT SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS A LITTLE BIT ANYWAY. RIGHT SINCE THEY WERE SERVING THEIR AT ONE POINT. IT SHOULD MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. FOLKS ON THE FIRST FLOOR WILL CONSIDER. QUESTION ABSOLUTELY DELIVER GOOD MORNING. I WANT TO TOUCH ON TWO THINGS THAT WERE SAID STARVING OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND A BILLION DOLLARS SO BEING NEW TO THIS PROCESS. IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE AS A STATE WOULD NOT GIVE YOU THE MONEY. AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES ONE AND TWO IS YOUR THOUGHT THAT IT WILL BE A BILLION DOLLARS TO GET A NEW INSTITUTION UP AND RUNNING. WELL TO START OFF ON THE OPERATING COST OF THINGS SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. EVERY YEAR YOU PROVIDE US AN APPROPRIATION OF SOME SORT RIGHT WHETHER THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE A SLIGHT INCREASE OR WHATEVER THE CASES. WHAT I MEANT BY STARVING IS IS THAT THEN WE ALREADY HAVE EXISTING TWENTY THREE CAMPUS? AND THEY ALL HAVE VARIOUS GOALS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE ESPECIALLY ON ENROLLMENT RIGHT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF CAMPUSES THAT ARE IMPACTED WOULD LOVE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE ACCESS TO LOCAL STUDENTS AND AND STUDENTS WRIT LARGE ACROSS STATE. WHAT YOU END UP HAVING IS THAT THE MORE CAMPUS IS THAT YOU HAVE AN ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A BRAND NEW CAMPUS? YOU YOU REALLY HAVE TO JUGGLE THAT THAT. FEEDING OF YOUR TWENTY THREE THEN TWENTY FOUR KIDS RIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO SPREAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS NEW TO THE UNIVERSITY. WE NEED MORE MONEY FROM US. YES OKAY THAT'S PERRANCE WELL NO OKAY GOOD GOOD AND THEN THE BILLION DOLLARS SPECIALLY SPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW YOUR WHEN YOU'RE HIRING ADDITIONAL FOLKS AND THEN IF THEIR SALARY INCREASES SECOND RIGHT THERE'S THAT DISTANCE A LARGER UNIVERSITY MEANS OF LARGE COSTS RIGHT. TOTALLY MAKES SENSE THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT COSTS TO GET YOU SEE MERCED UP AND RUNNING BUILT FALL -- FOR THEY DID START WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT JUST LIKE WE STARTED WITH SMALLER DOLLARS IT CHANNEL ISLANDS AND MONTEREY BAY AS WE BUILD FACILITIES BASED ON PROJECTED ENROLLMENT. BUT OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IT EASIER SAID THEY'RE GOING MUCH FASTER THAN CERTAINLY WORK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO. THAT BALANCING THE NEEDS OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES YEAH I WOULD THINK A IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE GATE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSE. TO AB SEVENTY EIGHTY MILLION AS FAR AS INITIAL FACILITIES. DID WE GIVE YOU THE MONEY FOR YOU SEE MORE SAID MEANING THE STATE THERE ARE SOME THEY'VE DONE SOME SELF FUNDING BUT ALSO SOME PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND A LARGE AMOUNT. OF THE CITY COMES BACK AND SAYS A NEW CAMPUS IS WARRANTED IN CHULA VISTA OR STANTON NO. STOCKTON EXCUSE ME -- THEN WE WOULD NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME MONEY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THAT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY MILLION A LOT. YES NOT A BILLION BUT A LOT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU WHAT WILL I ASSUME YOU DO YOUR CAPITAL PROJECTS WITH BINDING CAPACITY DON'T YOU. MOST RATES WHAT RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN USING OUR OWN CAPACITY THAT'S CORRECT. WELL SO IF IF IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AND LEGISLATURE PROVES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. A NEW CAMPUS. IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PROPERLY FUNDED BOTH IN TERMS OF OPERATING REVENUE [inaudible] AND SUPPORT FOR THE THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE NECESSARY WHETHER IT'S YOUR OWN BONDS OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF FINANCING THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT. I DIDN'T IN THE GOVERNOR'S AT OUR PROPOSAL TODAY GOVERNOR WE REQUESTED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PERMANENT BASE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE. SO IT WOULD IT WOULD NEED TO INCREASE FROM THAT AMOUNT THE GOVERNOR DID NOT SUPPORT THAT BUT THAT WAS OUR REQUEST. WELL AND OF COURSE THIS ISSUE IS SIMPLY A STUDY NOT. TO TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING NEW CAMPUSES. MY QUESTION WAS IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WANT TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE OUR COLLEAGUE AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST A SATELLITE CAMPUS IT'S NOT SOMETHING ELSE CHULA VISTA. COULD THAT BE ADDED TO THE STUDY AND I GUESS THE ANSWER IS YES. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND IT'S NOT DOUBLING BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MORE THAN THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY JUST MAIL ABSOLUTELY -- JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AS WELL FOR THE PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFIED THE SAN JOAQUIN AREA SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROPOSAL -- LARGELY BECAUSE OF A FEW DEMOGRAPHIC. FACTORS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO ONE BEING THAT REAL PERSONAL INCOME IN THE EGION IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. AND ALSO THAT -- UNEMPLOYMENT IS NEARLY DOUBLE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE THOSE ARE BASED ON TWENTY SEVENTEEN INFORMATION. WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN THAT REGION AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOWER THAN STATEWIDE AVERAGE NUMBER THAT MEET CRITERIA CURRENTLY FOR YOU SEE OR CSU ADMISSION. THE PART OF THE RATIONALE IN LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN THAT REGION WOULD BE WITH THE IDEA OF CONSIDERING WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE. ECONOMIC GROWTH BENEFITS IN THE AREA WHETHER IT WOULD ALSO -- LAND KIND OF THE CULTURE OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THAT AREA AND KIND OF STOP SOME OF THOSE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT WERE CURRENTLY SEEING. GRADUATING AT INCREASING NUMBERS BUT NOT NECESSARILY CURRENTLY MEETING THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR OUR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS -- REGARDING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ADDING POTENTIALLY CHULA VISTA TO THE STUDY BUT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE BACK BECAUSE AT THIS POINT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AS YOU KNOW FOR THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED SAN JOAQUIN BUT WE CAN TAKE THAT REQUEST BACK. AND AS YOU MENTIONED WERE NOT PRESUPPOSING IN THE PROPOSAL THAT THERE WOULD BE A NEW CAMPUS ASSEMBLY THAT WOULD BE A STUDY TO EXAMINE. THE POTENTIAL MERITS OF HAVING A CAMPUS AND THE DETAILS OF WHAT CRITERIA WOULD BE EXAMINED AS PART OF THAT STUDY WILL BE FORTHCOMING. WITHIN A REVISION IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE BUT CERTAINLY ONE ASPECT WE WOULD EXPECT TO LOOK AT WOULD BE THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS IF THERE THERE WERE TO BE A NEW CAMPUS PROPOSED. WELL CLEARLY THERE A LOT OF NEEDS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN. OF THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THEM WHETHER IT'S FINANCIALLY -- PRACTICAL AT THIS TIME. THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES GOING TO GOING TO REFLECT AND REVEAL ALONG WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT YOU -- YOU REFERENCED BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK SINCE WE'VE HAD A COLLEAGUE WHO IS RAISE THE CHILDREN'S. TO ISSUE. ONE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD -- WOOD. WHAT ADDITIONAL COST WOULD RESULT FROM ADDING THAT TO THE STUDY? TO DETERMINE YES OR NO HOURS OF THE CAMPUS RECITAL LIGHT IS THERE A NEED -- NOT THAT THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED. IN HAVING SOME IDEA FROM FROM FINANCES TO WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD ADD TO THE TO THE PROCESS I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE THAT BACK THANK YOU PERFECT THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT TO THE PRESENTATION I LOOK FORWARD -- TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. IF YOU SEARCH SIX IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM WE WILL REVISIT THAT. AT A LATER DATE LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE AGENDA WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE ON ITEM SIX SIX ONE ZERO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS BUDGET OPERATION. THAT THE SAME TEAM OKAY WHO WANTS TO PRESENT. YOUR RECORD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING FOR OPERATIONAL COSTS AT THE CSU. THIS FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT CRITICAL OPERATIONAL NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. INCLUDING CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED COMPENSATION COMPENSATION COMMITMENTS. NON SALARY COST INCREASES AND OTHER. OPERATIONAL COSTS. THIS INVESTMENT AS PART OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN NEW ON GOING GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT PROPOSED FOR VARIOUS PER PRIORITIES OUT THE CSU IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING THE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL. ADJUSTMENT THAT'S PROPOSED FOR THE CSU IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. COMES WITH AN ADMINISTRATION EXPECTATION THAT TUITION REMAIN FLAT. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE ACCESS INCREASES AND THAT TIME. TO AGREE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE JANUARY BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING CHANCELLOR WHITE ANNOUNCED THAT TUITION WILL REMAIN FLAT AT THE CSU. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WITH RESPECT -- TO SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION CHARGE IN ESSENCE THE NON RESIDENT TUITION AND THE ISSUE. HOW IS THAT -- HOW IS THAT HANDLED IN TERMS OF? BEING DISTRIBUTED IS IT RETAINED ON THE CAMPUS WHICH GENERATED OR DOES IT GO INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN IS IT RE DISTRIBUTED. TO ALL THE CAMPUS IS BECAUSE I ASSUME WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING THAT THERE. ARE SOME -- SEE ISSUE INSTITUTIONS TO DRAW MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND OTHERS ARE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS CORRECT ON ON AS HAVING MORE NON RESIDENTS AT SOME GAPS IN THE OTHER. I'D WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE CAMPUS -- COLLECTS THAT TO WITH THAT SUBLIMINAL TUITION REVENUE AND RETAINS IT AND USE THAT TO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS THAT THEY ARE -- EDUCATING ON NONRESIDENT STUDENTS. WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE IT TO IN THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL IT'S IT'S SORT OF FASCINATED ME. BECAUSE THE THE MARGINAL COST OF EDUCATING THE STUDENT IS PROBABLY THE SAME. DOESN'T COST ANYMORE AN EDUCATED NON RESIDENT SOMEBODY FROM ARIZONA THAN IT DOES FROM CALIFORNIA I ASSUME. FOR DOING THE ADMISSIONS PROPERLY. AND SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE AND AND I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE EQUITY IN IN TERMS OF ALLOWING CAMPUSES TO RETAIN THE DELTA JUST BECAUSE THEY OR ON THE COASTER NEAR BEECHER PERHAPS HAVE A SPECIALTY PROGRAM THAT. THE TRACKS NONRESIDENT STUDENTS WERE AS PERHAPS FRESNO WERE. SAMBAR DINO OR SOMEWHERE ELSE DOESN'T. COULDYOU COMMENT A WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY ADDED THROUGH THIS REALLY REALLY A TRICKY SITUATION -- SO IF WE GO BACK MANY DECADES AGO THE WAIT TO SEE ISSUE WAS STRUCTURED AND FUNDED. WAS AND A MODEL IN WHICH WHATEVER TYPE OF PROGRAM YOU OFFERED WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS BY THE MINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. ON A KIND OF A A TYPE OF DEGREE SORT OF FUNDING LEVEL SO IF ENGINEERING WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THE C. SHE WOULD RECEIVE A TOUCH MORE MONEY. TO TO PAY FOR AN ENGINEERING MORE ADDITIONAL ARE ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING SLOTS PERSON MAY DISABLE A LIBERAL ARTS SORT OF DEGREE. SO THAT WAS A MODEL UP UNTIL NINETY THREE NINETY FOUR TIME FRAME. THEN -- BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF RECESSIONS THAT OCCURRED INCLUDING THAT THAT ONE IN THE EARLY NINETIES. THERE WAS REALLY AID A DRIVE IN THE SHIFT FROM THE STATE AS WELL AS FROM THE C. ISSUES PERSPECTIVE TO SHIFT TO MORE OF WHAT WE CALL INCIDENT INPUT MODEL WHAT WE HAD BEFORE MORE OF A REVENUE MODEL WHERE. WHATEVER THE STATE COULD PROVIDE IN TERMS OF FUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY THERE IS AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON A PER STUDENT BASIS THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE UNIVERSITY. TO THAT EDUCATE A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO HE RECEIVED. WHAT WE CALL THE MARGINAL COST OF ADDITIONS -- FUNDING. WHICH YOU SEE IN YOUR IN YOUR IN YOUR AGENDA. THERE'S AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO SERVE ANY AND ALL TYPES OF DEGREES GRADUATE. DEGREES AS WELL AS UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES RIGHT. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE -- TO THEN -- ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING TO CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON THAT FUNDING WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER -- YOU KNOW MORE ENGINEERING WITH THAT FUNDING OR MORE LIBERAL ARTS. SORTS OF PROGRAMS THAT SORT OF THING. NOBODY COMES DOWN -- TO THE IDEA OF REGION ALLERGY AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- IT ALSO IS VERY TRICKY RIGHT BECAUSE COSTS ARE HIGHER IN DIFFERENT AREAS -- BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE DO -- IS IS ON AVERAGE -- YOU KNOW LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE AN AVERAGE. COST PER STUDENT -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE NON RESIDENT RESIDENT STUDENTS. AND THAT'S ACROSS ALL MODES IN LEVELS AND THAT KIND OF THING. AND SO ESSENTIALLY GETTING TO YOUR POINT OF THE NON RESIDENT NON RESIDENT. TUITION BOTH THE SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AMOUNT WHICH EVERY STUDENT PACE FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN FORTY TWO PLUS THE SUPPLEMENTAL. THE NONRESIDENT PACE THAT ESSENTIALLY COVERS -- THEIR THEIR EDUCATION -- SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE IS AT ALL SUBSIDIZING NON RESIDENT STUDENTS FROM A FISCAL VANTAGE POINT. SO I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL WELL I I AGAIN IT IS PROBABLY NOT. THE PLACE FOR THIS. FOR POLICY DEBATE I GUESS BUT IT DOES INTEREST ME BECAUSE YOU COULD EVEN REALIZE IT IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT WHAT YOUR MA MARGINAL COST OF EDUCATION IS IF IT SAN LUIS OBISPO IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN FRESNO THEN. YOU COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST OF EDUCATING STUDENTS AT THE AT SAN LUIS OBISPO IS AND THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE A DELTA. BETWEEN WHAT THE A NON RESIDENT PAYS AND WHAT THE COST OF EDUCATING THAT STUDENT IS. WHETHER IT'S ENGINEERING OR WHATEVER YOU COULD EVEN. PARTICULAR RISE IT TOO IN TERMS OF DEPARTMENT OR SPECIALTY. AND THEN OVER ABOVE THAT YOU HAVE A DELTA SO FOR THOSE IN THIS BUILDING WHO WERE INTERESTED IN. MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS GET INTO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL. IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED. SPREADING THE NON RESIDENT DELTA AMONG THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES WOULD NOT ONLY SEEM TO ME. BE MORE EQUITABLE SITUATION SORT OF MAKING THE CANS IN THE CAMPS. OUR HAVES AND HAVE NOTS SORT OF EQUAL BUT IT MIGHT ALSO SERVE AS A DISINCENTIVE -- WITH RESPECT TO NON RESIDENTS OF APPLICANTS SELECTION ENROLLMENT LOW'S REGIS MY COMMENTS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A POSITION ON THAT BUT I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONTINUED CONVERSATION BOTH WITH C. ISSUE AND WITH YOU SEE ON THAT AND AND AGAIN IF I'M WRONG WHICH IS. TRUE. A LOT OF THE TIME. YOU'RE FREE TO LET ME KNOW BUT JUST THINK ABOUT THAT WHICH WHAT THE WHAT THE ONLY POINT ALL ALL ALL ALL. ALL MAKE HERE AT THIS POINT BEFORE. SO WE CAN KEEP THE HEARING GOING ALONG. IS THAT -- SYSTEM WIDE -- ABOUT NON RESIDENT STUDENTS SO IT'S RATHER INSIGNIFICANT PRETTY INSIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME MORE DESIRABLE CAMPUS CAMPUSES AND OTHERS BUT IN TERMS OF ARE WE AT YOU KNOW 203040% WRIST AND NO NOT EVEN NOT EVEN CLOSE IT'S PRETTY. INSIGNIFICANT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SITUATION AT UC THAT'S CORRECT SO YOU GET A GOLD STAR CENTER. YES SIR QUESTION. TOMORROW YEAH I I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON ON PAY HOW DOES THE CSU COMPARE AND PAY TWO YEAR -- PROFESSORS TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES. WELL WHAT WE DO -- IS WE THAT'S A HARD QUESTION ANSWER. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WILL DISAGREE -- ON HOW I WOULD ANSWER PER PERHAPS. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I'LL SAY HOW WE HANDLE IT FROM A SYSTEM MY PERSPECTIVE. WHICH IS OUR ATTEMPT IS TO ALWAYS TRY OUR BEST TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SALARY INCREASES TO OUR FACULTY AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO KEEP THEM COMPETITIVE IN THE FIELD BUT AND ALSO KEEP THEM AT A AT A POINT WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY. I LIVE IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY LIVE -- AND AND I AND I JUST ABOUT THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE I'M SURE PLENTY OF FACULTY MEMBERS THAT WILL SAY WELL I TEACH IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT'S COULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WHEN YOU'RE TEACHING MAYBE AN INTERLOCK KIND OF A THING. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING -- WHAT ARE -- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TEAM AT THIS AT THE CHANCES OFFICE RESIDUES ALWAYS TRIES -- TO DO INTERNAL ANALYSES ABOUT WHERE ARE. OUR PROFESSORS RANK IN TERMS OF THE MARKET. OKAY. AND ONE THING THAT -- OUR STRUCTURE ALLOWS IS FOR CAMPUSES TO ATTRACT FACULTY AT THE SALARIES THAT WILL ATTRACT THEM TO THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS -- AND SO. GENERALLY SPEAKING. I I REALLY CAN'T SAY WHETHER. SEE ISSUE. FACULTY ARE PAID BETTER THAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOU SEE BECAUSE IT'S LARGER CAN BE DEPENDED ON THAT PARTICULAR FACULTY MEMBERS -- PREFERENCE I MEAN AT THAT PARTICULAR FACULTY MEMBERS -- POSITION IN TERMS THEIR HIRING. AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT WOULD CROSS WALK OUT BETWEEN -- ALL THE SEGMENTS WOULD YOU HAVE WOULD YOU HAVE ANY DATA LIKE THIS IN HIS COUNTY MY COUNTY RIVERSIDE USERS COUPLE SEE ISSUES THERE AS WELL AS A NUMBER PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WOULD THEY'RE ALL. ECONOMICALLY OUTLINED PROBABLY THE SAME HOUSING PRICES WHICH HE SAID WOULD YOU HAVE ANY. EMPIRICAL DATA ON OUT I DON'T HAVE IT AT HAND RIGHT NOW BUT I COULD ALWAYS PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE LATER ON IF YOU LIKE YEAH I I I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT -- HOW'S YOUR RETENTION WHICH A RETENTION RATE. WELL I BELIEVE EVERY YEAR IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY -- THERE ARE ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED TEN YEAR TENURE TRACK FACULTY. ODDS OF PERSONNEL THAT. RETIRE SEPARATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY -- SO WHAT WE DO IS THAT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY EVERY YEAR ATTEMPTING TO TRY. TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS BACKED OFFICE POSITIONS AS AS THEY LEAVE -- AND GENERALLY -- OVER THE LAST I THINK THREE TO FIVE YEARS -- WE HAVE GAINED ON NET ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MORE -- TENURE TENURE TRACK FACULTY -- SO WE ARE LOSING FACULTY TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR TO RETIREMENT BUT WE ARE -- WE'RE ALSO BACK FEELING AND AND ADDING TO ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS THAT WERE KEENLY AWARE OF IN TRYING TO MARRY OUR FACULTY TO IS THE OUR GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS THE NOTION THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COURSES FOR ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR CURRENTLY. ENROLLED STUDENTS SO THEY CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL COURSES SO THEY CAN GRADUATE. IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER IF THEY CHOOSE. SO ONE OF THE BIG EFFORTS YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER IS THAT GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND PART OF THAT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT IS HIRING OF ADDITIONAL FACULTY ABOVE AND BEYOND THE RING SO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. DO YOU USE -- COMPARATIVE AND COMPARED TO OR IN INSTITUTIONS IN A IN TERMS OF SETTING SALARY SCHEDULES FOR YOUR FACULTY. I THINK WE DO FOR IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF DISCUSSING THAT ON IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- I THINK IT WILL DEPEND UPON -- APART ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON THE CAMPUSES. ABOUT THEIR PARTICULAR HIRING PRACTICES BUT I I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AND FOR ME THAT I CAN I CAN SHARE IT. DID YOU OKAY. YEAH YEAH YES SIR AND JUST. TO ADD SOME MORE INFORMATION OUR OFFICE ACTUALLY RECENTLY LOOKED AT SALARIES OF PROFESSORS AT THE CSU. AND UC COMPARED TO PEER INSTITUTIONS SO FOR CSU WE LOOKED AT CSU TENURE TRACK TENURED TENURE TRACK FACULTY SALARIES COMPARED. TO OTHER PUBLIC MASTERS LEVEL INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT CSU -- ARE ON AVERAGE HAD HIGHER SALARIES NOW THAT'S COMPARED TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LESS EXPENSIVE PLACES LIKE IOWA BUT THEY THEY TEND TO BE HIGHER WE CAN GET YOU THAT. WE WE JUST HAD A PUBLICATION IN JANUARY THAT INCLUDED. OTHERS DATA. WITH REGARD TO RETENTION. THE ONLY THING I'M AWARE OF IS BACK IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. PRESENT A DID A COMPENSATION STUDY AND PRESENTED ON THAT AT A BOARD MEETING AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT. RETENTION RATES AMONG FACULTY ON AVERAGE WERE LOWER THAN PEER INSTITUTIONS AND THAT THEY WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO ATTRACT A COMPETITIVE POOL OF CANDIDATES AND HIRE WHO THEY WANTED TO HIRE. A SAID THAT WAS THE LAST A STUDY I'M AWARE OF I I KNOW THAT. CSU PERIODICALLY DOES THESE SORTS OF STUDIES TO SEE WHERE THEY STAND RELATIVE TO THEIR PEERS IN THAT CAN HELP INFORM THEIR BARGAINING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- PROCESS SEES. INTERESTING BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T YOU KNOW REGULARLY -- GO TO THE BOARD EVERY YEAR WITH AND AND INFORM THEM OF IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE PERIODICALLY DO AS NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO WERE ISSUE NUMBER TWO OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE HOLD OPEN ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS ENROLLMENT GROWTH. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIXTY TWO MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT 2% ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT THE CSU WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY SEVEN NEARLY ACTUALLY SAY. SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. JOINT MERE PROCEED IF YOU WOULD SIR THAT WOULD BE FINE YES SO ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS JUST ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL -- ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DECIDE ON EVERY YEAR -- LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS SEVERAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER THIS YEAR WHEN DETERMINING. THE LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING TO PROVIDE CSU. FIRST TO ANSWER INTERESTINGLY THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. IN THE STATE IS ACTUALLY PROJECTED TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY. THIS YEAR ARE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT ALL OF THE THING ST EQUAL ENROLLMENT DEMAND FOR FRESHMAN ADMISSION IN THE FALL. FALL. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILL DECREASE SLIGHTLY AS WELL. OF NOTE HOWEVER IS THAT CSU IS BEEN DRAWING FROM WELL BEYOND THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY POLICY WHICH LIMITS FRESHMAN ADMISSION TO THE TOP 33% OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE LEARNED THAT CSU HAD BEEN DRYING FROM JUST OVER 40% OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT WAS DONE THROUGH A STUDY THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED. ARE AN UPDATED INFORMATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUGGEST THAT CSU IS LIKELY DRAWING FROM A EVEN LARGER POOL TODAY. THE LIKELY DUE IN PART TO THE DRYING FROM. BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL ELIGIBILITY POOL IN FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND FRESHMAN APPLICANTS PLUS AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE THOUSAND TRANSFER APPLICANTS. MET CS USE MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS BUT WERE NOT ACCEPTED AT ANY. CSU CAMPUS TO WHICH THEY APPLIED. AND AS PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR GENDER NOTE SEIZE APPLICANTS ARE KNOWN AS DENIED ELIGIBLES THEY DIDN'T GET IN ANYWHERE IT CSU EVEN IF THERE WAS JUST ONE CAMPUS THEY APPLIED TO THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED IT'S NIGHT ELIGIBLE WITH THEM BUT THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE STATISTIC RIGHT. I MEAN IF I APPLY. TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND DON'T GET IN. I AM A DESIGN ELIGIBLE EVEN THOUGH. I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REDIRECTION POLICYTHAT YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING EVEN THOUGH I PERHAPS COULD HAVE BEEN AND ADMITTED TO SEMBRA DINO OR FRESNO WERE. CHANNEL ISLANDS ARE MONTEREY BAY RIGHT THAT THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE IS. IS INFORMATION ON WHETHER THE STUDENTS APPLIED TO A CAMPUS BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR NEAREST CAMP. AND THEY WERE IN THAT REGION IN THAT AREA THEY MIGHT BE ACROSS THE STREET FROM SAN DIEGO STATE IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE. LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ALL WE HAVE IS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. ARE THAT APPLIED LAST YEAR THEY DIDN'T GET IN INTO ANY CAMPUS AND SOME CASES. ARE YOU HAD YOU SEE STUDENTS WERE APPLYING DOUBLE DOUBLE CAMPUSES A LOT OF CASES THOUGH IT'S APPLYING TO JUST ONE CAMPUS MICHAEL LONG BEACH OR SAN DIEGO. CAN WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT STUDENTS FROM THE IT WOULD BE MORE TROUBLING IF THAT STUDENT WAS OF A LOCAL STUDENTS. AND JUST COULDN'T GET IN DESPITE MEETING THAT MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS [inaudible] SO. KNOWING THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF OF DENIED ELIGIBLES THE LEGISLATURE. MIGHT WISH TO PROVIDE ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO TRY TO BRING DOWN. THAT THAT UMBER THAT THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO NUMBER. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO DECIDE TO DO THAT. WE WOULD RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE MAKE IT CLEAR TO CSU WHAT THE INTENTIONS ARE TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF TONIGHT ELIGIBLES THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR CSU KNOWING THAT. THEY CAN BETTER TARGET IN CONCENTRATED ROMAN GROWTH FUNDS IN THE CAMPUSES AND PROGRAMS. THE HIGHEST ANNETTE ENROLLMENT DEMAND. AND AND AND BECAUSE OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND THE DECLINE IN WHAT HI HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE. IS REALLY NOT A RELEVANT. STATISTIC IS AND WE'VE GOT THIRTY THOUSAND FOLKS WHO. CLEARLY. MADE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND ARE TRYING TO GET INTO SEE ISSUE. ONE POINT ONE PHASE POINT OR THE OTHER AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO SO. AT LEAST THE SCHOOLS WERE THEY APPLIED. WE'LL HAVE A CLEARER IDEA ONCE WE GET THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY IN PLACE MAYBE SOMEONE COULD YEAH I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THE THE SEGWAY REALLY IT TO THE CSU CHANCES OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR NEW. AUTOMATIC REDIRECTION POLICY THAT THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO -- THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK. TO THE REDIRECTION POLICY AND ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND. I END OF REALLY MONITOR WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHETHER TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH STUDENTS WHO ARE REDIRECTED ACTUALLY DECIDE TO ENROLL IN A REDIRECTION CAMPUS BECAUSE I COULD HAVE SOME COST SIMPLE -- IMPLICATIONS IN THE OUT YEARS AT THE END SEE ISSUE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR REDIRECTION POLICY WHICH I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO DO -- WOULD YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE THE SYSTEM OF METRICS THAT I HOPE YOU HAVE SET UP OR AT LEAST WILL CONSIDER SETTING UP TO TRY -- TO GATHER SOME INFORMATION ON THESE QUALIFIED BUT DENIED -- FOLKS THIS POOL AND WHY AND WHERE AN THAT MAKES SENSE OKAY. WHO'S UP THE MY KOLLEGAL BILL THE NAIL ALL THOSE ALL THOSE DOWN PRETTY WELL PERFECT. GOOD MORNING I AM DOCTOR APRIL GROWN DIRECTOR OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. AS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR BEGAN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE ROLLED AND ROLLED ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS THE FIFTH YEAR OF RECORD STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN THE CSU AND NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS THAN JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. WELL THE CSU HAS BEEN LASER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING DEGREE FOR COMPLETION AND REDUCING TIME TO DEGREE AS WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT ITEM WE'VE ALSO MAINTAINED EMPHASIS ON OUR MISSION OF ACCESS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT FROM WHICH TO START OUR DISCUSSION TODAY BECAUSE WHILE IN ROME IT IS OFFER CONSIDER ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMISSION OF NEW STUDENTS. THE MORE CRITICAL ELEMENT OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT IS SERVING CONTINUING STUDENTS AS FOR THE CSU THEY COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY THIS DELICATE BALANCE ACT OF ENROLLMENT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAINING NOT ONLY ACCESS TO THE CSU BUT AUTHENTIC ACCESS WERE ALL STUDENTS SPOKE CONTINUING IN NEW HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND EARN A HIGH QUALITY DEGREE IN A TIMELY MANNER. FOR FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS APPLIED FOR ADMISSION TO THE CSU. AS FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. 77% WERE ADMITTED TO THE CSU ULTIMATELY OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE STUDENTS ENROLLED LAST FALL. A RECORD NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS FOR THE FALL TERM THAN JUST SIX YEARS AGO. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED BY SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FORTY IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ALMOST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND NEW TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARRIVED AT THE CSU WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. AND THAT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR ENTERING TRANSFER STUDENT POPULATION. THIS NUMBER IS A 60% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW TRANSFER STUDENT WHO HAD EARNED IN AT T. PRIOR TO TRANSFER COMPARED FIFTEEN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TREND BECAUSE TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO HAVE EARNED IN AT T. ENTER THE CSU BETTER PREPARED AND HAVING COMPLETED SPECIFIC COURSE WORK AFTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT SATISFIES AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR CSU DEGREE REQUIREMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME WE SEE THESE TRENDS AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WE ARE EXPERIENCING IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THOSE STUDENTS ACTING HIGH SCHOOL WHO SEEK TO ATTEND COLLEGE AFTER GRADUATION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION REPORTS THAT ALMOST SCHOOL GRADUATES COMPLETED THE SET OF THE S. YOU AND YOU SEE COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES KNOWN AS A THREE G.. COMPARED 234% A DECADE AGO. EACH YEAR WE CONTINUE TO SEE MORE BETTER PREPARES STUDENTS SEEKING A HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE CSU DEGREE. IN FACT OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS APPLIED FOR FALL ADMISSION LAST YEAR THAN IN FALL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AS A REFERENCE ERLIER PLANNING AND MANAGING ENROLLMENT REQUIRES CLOSE ATTENTION NOT ONLY TO NEW AND FUTURE STUDENTS BUT AS IMPORTANTLY ATTENTION TO THE ENROLLMENT DEMAND AND CAPACITY FOR CONTINUING STUDENTS. ALL TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES USE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES TO MAX MAXIMIZE THEIR FINITE ENROLLMENT CAPACITY THAT EXISTS ON THEIR CAMPUSES. FOR EXAMPLE CAMPUSES REGULAR. CREATE AND REFINED AGREE ROAD MAPS FOR FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. THESE ROAD MAPS ALLOW STUDENTS AND COUNSELORS TO VIEW UPDATE A SEMESTER BY SEMESTER PLAN. CAMPUSES SUBSEQUENTLY USE THIS DATA TO PLAN THE CLASS SCHEDULE AND TO PROVIDE COURSES NEEDED BASED ON THE STUDENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDING OPTIMAL PASSED FOR GRADUATION. IN A TOOL FOR EFFICIENTLY MANAGING ENROLLMENT. STUDENT ROAD MAP DATA THE NUMBER OF MAJORS PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND PRIOR YEAR ENROLLMENT PATTERNS ARE USED TO CONTINUALLY ANALYZE COURSE DEMAND. CAMPUSES PAY PARTICULAR CAN'T ATTENTION TO HIGH DEMAND COURSES PRIORITIZING CLASSROOM SCHEDULING IN FACULTY ASSIGNMENTS FOR THESE COURSES. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAMPUSES ARE PROVIDING TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO FACULTY TO REDESIGN COURSES TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS INCLUDES MOVING COURSES TO FULLY ONLINE OR HYBRID FORMATS. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE USE OF VIRTUAL LABS ENGAGING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS THEIR INNOVATIVE ONLINE TECHNOLOGIES. FINALLY CAMPUSES ARE INCREASING ADVISING RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT STUDENTS TO THEIR GRADUATION GOALS AND HELP CAMPUSES MANAGE ENROLLMENT. ALL CAMPUSES USE A COMBINATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE STUDENT ACCESS TO COURSES IN SUPPORT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE CAMPUS IS IMPACTED. HOWEVER ONCE THE STRATEGIES ARE NO LONGER SUFFICIENT ON THEIR OWN FOR MANAGING ENROLLMENT CAMPUS MAY REQUEST TO DECLARE IMPACTION TO BETTER CONTROL THE ENROLLMENT OF NEW STUDENTS. SHORTLY THE CSU WILL BEGIN THE REDIRECTION OF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AN UPPER DIVISION TRANSFER STUDENTS. WHO MEET CSU MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND WE'RE NOT ADMITTED TO ANY CSU CAMPUS THEY APPLIED FOR FALL? TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN APPLICANTS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE CAMPUS TO HAVE THEIR APPLICATION REDIRECTED. ANY APPLICANT THAT DOES NOT RESPOND WILL ALSO BE REDIRECTED TO A CAMPUS THAT STILL HAS CAPACITY TO ENSURE ALL CSU ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS HAVE A SPOT AT THE CSU IF THEY WANT TO ATTEND. IN CLOSING INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES IN THE CSU SYSTEM ARE CAREFULLY BALANCING ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING STUDENTS SEEKING TO MAKE TIMELY PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR DEGREE WITH THE GROWING PERSPECTIVE STUDENT POPULATION. FROM CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY CLLEGES WHICH IS LARGER AND BETTER PREPARED AND MORE DIVERSE. CAMPUSES MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER AND EVALUATE THEIR CAPACITY AND RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AUTHENTIC ACCESS TO CONTINUING A NEW STUDENT. WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS 94% OF WHICH ARE FROM CALIFORNIA THE CSU EDUCATES THE MOST APPLE. I THINK ACNE KLAY ECONOMICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY IN THE NATION. STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS HAVE ALL TAKEN THE RIGHT STEPS TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE BUT TO MEET THE DEMAND FROM INCREASING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND AS IMPORTANTLY MEET CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS FOR AN EDUCATED WORK FORCE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE US AND GLOBALLY. WE WILL NEED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM A PLACE THAT THE CSU. THANK YOU MAY I BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO ON THE RE DIRECTION IF I AM APPLYING AND I LIST OF SAN DIEGO STATE IS MY NUMBER ONE AND CAL POLY POMONA'S MY NUMBER. TWO AND I DON'T GET INTO EITHER ONE OFTHOSE IN MY RE DIRECTED. SO CAL POLY AND SAN DIEGO STATE WILL NOT BE ON THE LIST OF CAMPUS IS THE STUDENT CAN CHOOSE ALL WE HAVE A WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT TO NINE CAMPUS NON IMPACTED ONCE OKAY YES AND WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE ADDITIONAL ONES THAT -- DETERMINED THAT THEY NEED HAD CAPACITY TO SUPPORT STUDENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE EAST BAY AND SNOW MISSTATE HAVE ALSO COMMITTED TO TAKING REDIRECTED APPLICATIONS. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE EIGHT TO NINE CAMPUSES MARITIME ACADEMY ALSO HAS A COUPLE BUSINESS PROGRAM SO FOR STUDENT WANTED TO SELECT MARITIME ACADEMY THAT WOULD ALSO WORK -- TO ANSWER ONE OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT ONLY ASKING THE STUDENTS ARE THEY WHAT THEIR FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE CAMPUSES ARE WE ARE ALSO ASKING THEM UP FRONT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN RE DIRECTION. IF THEY SAY NO WE'RE HOPING TO AND HAVE THEM ANSWER A DROP DOWN QUESTION AS TO WHY THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED SO. THEY CAN'T COMMUTE TO THE CAMPUS -- THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE CAMPUSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THERE'S ALSO ONE OTHER -- THAT THEY'RE ATTENDING ANOTHER COLLEGE -- TO POINT OUT IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE SEVEN THERE'S SOME INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE DONE ABOUT THE QUALITY. IN HERE IT'S CALLED QUALIFIED BUT DENIED STUDENTS AND WE LOOKED AT THE STUDENT CLEARING HOUSE DATA AND 75% OF THE QUALIFIED BUT DENIED STUDENTS ENROLLED. ACTUALLY WERE AT OTHER HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS AND SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE EITHER YOU SEE PRIVATE OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND 18% ENROLLED IN OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS SO ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND BETTER DENIED ELIGIBLE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE. BUT AS PART OF THE ROLL OUT OF THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY. I I YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING DATA INCLUDING. IF YOU DON'T WANT REDIRECTION Y. KARATE SOME DATA POINTS THERE. AND THEN PRESUMABLY GONNA YOU'LL HAVE SOME DATA AS TO WHETHER STUDENTS ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL TO WHICH THEY'VE BEEN REDIRECTED -- WILL THERE BE SOME REFINED -- DATA ANALYSIS AND WILL THERE BE A REPORT THAT GENERATES AT SOME POINT TO US IS. TELL US HOW THIS PROP PROCESS IS WORKING OF THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING. MAKES SENSE. YES I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS CALLED FOR IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE BUT I'M SURE IF IT WAS REQUESTED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT ONCE WE HAVE FINAL NUMBERS. AFTER FALL NIGHT OF FALLS OUT FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CENSUS GREEN BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME WHETHER WE GET IT OR NOT YOU WOULD WANT IT RIGHT YOU WANT TO KNOW. HOW MANY OF THESE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL TO WHICH THEY'VE BEEN RE DIRECTED? YES BECAUSE WE NEED. TO OF REDIRECTION IS NOT JUST A AN INITIAL TIME PERIOD BECAUSE WE NEED TO NOW SUPPORT THAT INCREASE ENROLLMENT AT THE CAMPUSES THAT THEY ACTUALLY ENROLLED SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS OVER THE FOUR YEARS OF THEIR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AS FRESHMEN OR TWO YEARS AS TRANSFER. STUDENTS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW. WE WANT TO UNDER BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE FOR DEMAND SO WE CAN HELP CAMPUSES PLAN CORRECTLY IN THEIR ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WITH THE CAMPUS IS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTING THE RE DIRECTED APPLICANT. RIGHT AND IF THERE IF THE IF FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT THE 20% OF THE STUDENTS WHO WERE REDIRECTED. TO FRESNO DIDNOT OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE CHICO OR SOMEWHERE DID NOT IN ROLE THERE THEN I WOULD THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN A FURTHER ANALYSIS YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHY NOT. BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S A MARKETING EFFORT. IT IDEALLY GIVEN THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE WANT A MAXIMA AND THE COST OF FACILITIES AND ALL THE REST OF IT. WE WOULD WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE CAPACITY WE HAVE IT ALL OVER CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO FILL THE HOLES AND FILL THE GAPS AND FILL THE SEATS. WERE THERE ARE SEATS STILL TO BE FILLED SO I'M JUST CURIOUS YES SIR WHAT CAN I ADD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT THIS SO -- SO APRIL TALKING FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF GETTING AS MANY THE STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE OUT TO THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SOME CAPACITY. THE ONE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE GOING FORWARD WITH THIS IS THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WILL TAKE US UP ON THIS REDIRECTION OFFER. ON TOP OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD STE. WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID STREAM OF FUNDING. AVAILABLE -- TO SUPPORT AND AND AND AND AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IF A NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS SAY IF FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM ARE RE DIRECTED. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SPOTS OR HANDFUL SPOTS ON SOME CAMPUSES WHERE THEY ARE UNDER THEIR FUNDED ENROLLMENT TARGETS MEETING THERE'S THERE'S FUNDING THAT IS ON THAT CAMPUS THAT COULD. ACTUALLY EDUCATE THOSE ADDITIONAL SUITS AT SHOPPING GET TO THAT FUNDED PERFECT. FUNDED TARGET LEVEL. IF WE HAVE A LOT MORE THE STUDENTS. END UP LANDING ON SOMEBODY'S RE DIRECT CAMPUS WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PAY FOR THAT ADDITIONAL ACCESS. ONE OF THOSE WAYS THAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR IS TO USE THE ONE TIME ENROLLMENT FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDING THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR RECEIVED RIGHT ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WE STILL HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TEMPORARILY. SUPPORT THE STUDENTS FINANCIALLY FOR THEIR FOR THEIR COURSES THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES THAT SORT OF THING. BUT THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE ARE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WITH THIS REDUCTION POLICY IS. WHILE THE WELL WE DID HAVE A REDIRECTION POLICY SET UP FOR THE AT T. STUDENTS AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THEM THAT TOOK US UP ON THAT RE DIRECTION OFFER. WE OUGHT WE DO BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS WE WE'D WE'D WE'RE NOT SURE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS WILL ARRIVE -- THAT WILL TAKE US UP ON THAT RE DIRECTION OFFER AND AND HOW WE CAN SUSTAIN THEM NOT ONLY IN IN A SHORT TERM BASIS FOR THOSE ONE TIME MONIES BUT OVER THE LONG HAUL. THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE IN IRAQ INCLUDING UNDERSTAND IT BUT I ALSO AND I ALSO THINK THAT -- WE NEED TO HAVE SOME ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME BUDGETING ISSUE THAT YOU WILL FACE ANYWAY WHERE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD PLAN. THE WAY WE BUDGET FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF FUND. THE KIDS SORT OF FLOATED IN AND PROVIDE MONEY THROUGH CONTINGENCIES FOR YOU. THIS IS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS ONE BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA -- TO REALLY DO ACCURATE PLANNING. BUT WILL THE DIRECTION. AS OF YET FIRST YEAR RIGHT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE THOUGH IS THAT THE OF THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE. ALLOCATED IN ROLE THAT ENROLLMENT OF 2%. ABOUT TO US SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WE HAVE ALLOCATED THAT OUT TO ALL THE CAMPUSES. RIGHT WE'VE WE'VE SPREAD THAT TO THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND TOLD THEM IF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HOLDS YOU SANTA SPADE HAVING THE ABILITY SERVE AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THAT MAY CUT DOWN ON THE NUMBER OF REDIRECTED FROM YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO APPLY TO FRESNO STATE. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE CAPACITY THAN FRESNO STATE SO THAT MAYBE THEY ARE HAVING TO BE RE DIRECTED SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP. WE MAY BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE FISCAL IMPACTS WITH AN F. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED 2% HOLDS. AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE ONE TIME FUNDS TO A KIND OF BRIDGE ANY ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND THEN REVISITED AND EVERY VISIT LATER RIGHT ON REGIONAL SUBSEQUENT YEARS RIGHT. GOOD VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I MEAN IF YOU BELIEVE THE FOLKS AT TO TALK ON THESE ISSUES THEY SAY WE NEED ANOTHER MILLION. BACHELOR'S DEGREE EMPLOYEES IN THE WORK FORCE AND I THOUGHT THAT DATE WAS TWENTY THIRTY I COULD BE WRONG ON THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO FILL THE SEATS IN THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE CAPACITY AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GET THE MONEY. TO TO DO THAT IF THE STUDENTS ARE WILLING. TO GO TO CHICO OR MONTEREY BAY CHANNEL ISLANDS SO ENDED TALK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE VERY BRIEFLY -- OBVIOUSLY SEE ISSUE AT ITS SCALE AND SIZE WE MAKE ABOUT HALF OF THE DEGREES THAT NEED TO BE EARNED BY THAT TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE. AND SO WHAT OUR PLAN IS IS -- TO FOLD. THAT WE CAN BRING MORE DEGREES TO CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR GRADUATION ISSUE OF EFFORTS SO THAT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED OVER TH SIX YEAR SPAN. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON ENROLLMENT -- ON APRIL SIDE RIGHT THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ADD UPWARDS OF 5% OF NEW ENROLLMENT PER YEAR IN THE VERY NEXT TWO THREE FOUR YEARS. IN ORDER TO TO NOT ONLY HAVE GREATER THROUGHPUT OF OUR EXISTING GROUPS IT'S BETTER THAN ALSO YOU AFTER HALF MORE STUDENTS. THAT ARE EARNING DEGREES BETTER NOT HAVING ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WITH OUR BUDGET ASKING THAT'S WHY YOU SEE US A CONSISTENTLY COMING TO THE TO THE TO THE CAPITAL REQUESTING GRAD ISSUE FUNDING. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL IN ROME THE FUNDING ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR COGNIZANT OF THE DELTA BETWEEN THE THE PROPOSAL AND AND THE REQUEST AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE WITH ALL. STAKEHOLDERS POSI ISSUE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW WE SORT OF CLOSE THAT GAP OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES. FOR INTERESTED IN MEETING THE NEED WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT TO GET MORE PEOPLE GRADUATED WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE FOLKS -- IN THE PROGRAM'S FALL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR BUDGETARY CHALLENGES SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THAT. ONLINE MA'AM YOU MENTIONED JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION ONLINE EDUCATION I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT REFERENCED IN YOUR REMARKS. AND I KNOW THAT SEE ISSUE IS STEPPING OUT SMARTLY IN THE AREA OF ONLINE EDUCATION. ARE YOU ABLE TO IS. WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM. CAMPUS TO CAMPUS IS THEIR CROSS UTILIZATION OF ONLINE EDUCATION SO IF I'M AT CHANNEL ISLANDS. AND THERE'S AN ONLINE COURSE IT -- SEVEN CISCO OR ONE OF YOUR OTHER CAMPUSES IN MY ABLE TO ACCESS THAT IN IS HOW USER FRIENDLY IS THAT SYSTEM IF I AM. SO WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S CALLED CSU FULLY ONLINE IT WAS FIRST STARTED I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BASED ON AB. THREE EIGHTY SIX AND HAT THAT PROGRAM ALLOWS IS FOR STUDENTS -- TO THAT OUR CURRENT STUDENTS AT ONE CAMPUS BE ABLE TO REVIEW ALL ONLINE OFFERINGS BY OTHER CAMPUSES THEY DO HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA SO THEY HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ATTENDED TWELVE UNITS. AND ALSO HAVE A A TWO POINT OH GPA NOT BE AN ACADEMIC TROUBLE BEFORE THEY START AN ONLINE CLASS BUT THESE CLASSES WERE -- HELP ACTUALLY DEVELOPED USUALLY SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS ANY TYPE OF BOTTLE NECK OR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS THAT STUDENTS HAVE THAT THEY CAN'T GET AT THEIR OWN CAMPUS. SO WE HAVE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO FURTHER PROMOTE THAT PROGRAM AND ALSO -- REDO THE WEBSITE THAT STUDENTS USED TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY TO BE ABLE TO SEARCH ACROSS THE CAMPUSES. IF A STUDENT DOES FIND A COURSE THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THEY CAN ACTUALLY ENROLL FOR THAT COURSE THROUGH THEIR CAMPUS PORTAL SO IF I GO TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE AND I WANT TO TAKE A COURSE AT SAN DIEGO STATE -- I CAN GO ON TO MY SELF SERVICE WEBSITE IN NORTHRIDGE AND ENROLL FOR THAT COURSE AT SAN DIEGO STATE AND THEN SAN DIEGO ACTUALLY RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION THROUGH OUR CENTRAL -- TECHNOLOGY STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM AND IS ABLE TO PROCESS THAT STUDENT ENROLL THEM IN THAT ONLINE COURSE AND WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AS WE'VE. OP MORE HOLY PROMOTED THAT PROGRAM OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE JUST ONE QUICK DO WE HAVE DATA POINTS WHAT WHAT'S THE UTILIZATION WHAT'S THE TAKE RATE. I WE DO HAVE THOSE DATAPOINTS BUT I DON'T HAVE THEM HERE WITH ME TODAY THAT'S A GOOD THANK YOUS. YES SIR ACTUALLY THE DOCTOR GRUNBAUM MENTIONED A. B.. THREE EIGHTY SIX WHICH REQUIRED CSU DEVELOP ACROSS ENROLLMENT SYSTEM FOR ONLINE EDUCATION. THAT LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO DO A REPORT ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND HOW IS. CSU PROGRESSING. WE REALLY SAT REPORT IS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO -- SO IT'S IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE WHILE WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT REPORT WAS THAT UTILIZATION WAS ACTUALLY QUITE LOW BUT YET BUT IT WAS IT. AT NEW PROGRAM AT THE TIME I THINK IT WAS JUST A FEW THOUSAND STUDENTS SAID AVAIL THEMSELVES. OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS ENROLL IN ONLINE COURSES AT OTHER CAMPUSES I COULD BE DUE TO MARKETING WELL THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IS RELATIVELY WAS NOT RELATIVELY NEW. AT THE TIME STUDENTS TO KNOW ABOUT IT THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF THE PORTALS ACCESSIBILITY USER FRIENDLINESS IF YOU WILL. AND SO WE WE HAD RECOMMENDED THAT. CS YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR SYSTEM AND AND MAKE IT EASIER. TO REGISTER FIND CLASSES AND THEN ACTUALLY REGISTER IN THOSE CLASSES CLOSE LIKE THE LITTLE YOU SOMETHING IT'S SOMETHING I I KNOW THAT I I'VE BEEN RECEIVING SOME COMMUNICATION IS SOMETHING THEY ARE WORKING ON GREAT. PERFECT THANK YOU FOR TOLERATING MY QUESTIONS ON THAT SITTING FURTHER. LET'S TALK ABOUT -- ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS THE GRADUATION AND APROPOS OVER A CONVERSATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FORTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT CONTINUED PROGRESS FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA CSU IS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOALS OF THIS INITIATIVE WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT WILL AID THE CSU IN FURTHERING TIMELY COMPLETION. FINALLY GRADUATION I SHOULD SAY FOR FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS AS WELL AS DECREASING AT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. ALSO SORT OF A PROPOSES THAT TO THE LAST ITEM WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ENROLLMENT AND TIMELY GRADUATION ARE. INEXTRICABLY LINKED AS WHEN YOU HAVE TIME THE GRADUATION OF YOUR CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS THAT ALLOWS ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PRIORITIZES BOTH OF THOSE PRIORITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A I I SHOULD LET YOU WILL. FINISH PRESENTING BUT LET ME JUST THROW OUT THIS QUESTION DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY. WE HAVE A VARIATION. TO SOME EXTENT FOR A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN GRADUATION RATES BY CAMPUS [inaudible] JENNIFER QUESTION. YEAH GOOD MORNING CHUCKLED I'M WITH THE SYSTEM OFFICES WELL REDUCER YEAH IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS COME TO US WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- ASPECTS SOME OF THEM ARE -- LARGELY STAYING ON CAMPUS SOME OF THEM ARE LIVING AT HOME SOME OF THEM -- YOU KNOW ARE WORKING MANY JOBS OTHERS AREN'T SO THIS VARIATION YOU SEE FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. IS INDICATIVE OF THE SAME TYPE OF VARIATION YOU SEE ON OUR CAMPUSES WAS A DIM IS LARGELY A DEMOGRAPHIC KITCHENS CORRECT. INTEREST YESTERDAY WELL I WOULD I WOULD ADD SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S YOU WE WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT IMPACTED CAMPUSES. SO YOU HAVE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. TWO TWO EVEN APPLIED IT TO CSU. TO IT HISTORICALLY THAT'S BEEN ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS TO GET INTO THEIR CAMPUS AND THAT'S STILL THE CASE IN A LOT OF CAMPUSES THE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY IF YOU LIVE IN SACRAMENTO. YOU GET THAT MINIMUM. GPA AND OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR SAT SCORE YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT CAMPUS IN AND HOPEFULLY INTO A MAJOR AS LONG AS AT MAJORS NOT IMPACTION. IMPACTED NOW YOU HAVE CERTAIN CAMPUSES AT CSU WHERE THEY'VE IMPACTED. ALL ARE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEIR MAJORS THE CAMPUS IS IMPACTED IN THE MAJORS IMPACTED. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS TO GET IN SO I COULD CAL POLY. YOU CAN APPLY TO CAL POLY WITH A THREE OH GPA OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BUT IT'S UNLIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN [inaudible] SO. CAMPUSES BY DECLARING IMPACTION IN THEIR MAJORS IN THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE ABLE TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL INTO THE PROGRAM AND AS A RESULT THSE CAMPUSES TEND TO HAVE BETTER PREPARES SUDENTS COMING IN. AND HIGHER GRADUATION RATES IS. FOLLOWS FROM THAT A LOT OF TIMES. I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE YOU -- WE WERE NEXT ANYWAY ON THE PRESENTATION I THINK SO. YES I AM THRILLED YOU BUT I'M GONNA PUT YOU BACK ON THE TRACK. THE GOOD. SO AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON PAGE TWELVE A CSU CURRENTLY DESIGNATES ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONGOING RESOURCES FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE SPACE FUNDING TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS A 23% YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE. AS THE FIGURE ON PAGE TEN SHOWS CSU CONTINUES TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES FOR BOTH FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. GAPS IN GRADUATION RATES IS MORE OF A MIXED STORY GAPS AMONG CERTAIN REGIONAL RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS. HAVE NARROWED ALBEIT SLIGHTLY AND IN ADDITION DATA INDICATES STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH YOUR ACCESS UNITS WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM FOR THE STUDENTS STAY THERE THIRDS PAYING LESS. THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE GOOD FOR THE STATE AND ALSO IT FREES UP SOME COURSE LOTS RATHER STUDENTS WHO NEED THE WHO NEED THOSE COURSES GRADUATE. SO OVERALL CSU SHOWING IMPROVEMENT IN A NUMBER OF AREAS -- PERTAINING TO STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE GOING FORWARD WE RECOMMENDED LINK FUNDING -- FOR FOR THE INITIATIVE TO AN EXPECTATION THAT CSU CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. IN THESE KEY AREAS YOU KNOW AND GRADUATION RATES NARROWING ACHIEVEMENT CRACKED GAPS. BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT BY REDUCING EXCESS UNITS. ONE WAY CSU COULD CREATE A BETTER INCENTIVE FOR STUDENTS TO AVOID ACCESS UNIT ACCUMULATION AND MAXIMIZE AID FOR OTHER STUDENTS WOULD BE TO MODIFY A POLICY. ARE THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE ON THEIR INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM STATE UNIVERSITY GRANTS. CURRENTLY STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE A CSU GRANT FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNITS WHICH IS ONE FOUR YEARS WORTH OF UNITS BEYOND WHAT A STUDENT TYPICALLY NEEDS TO GRADUATE WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BY CONTRAST STATE LAW LIMITS CAL GRANTS THE STATE FUNDED CAL GRANTS TO FOUR YEARS OF FULL TIME. ATTENDANCE OR ITS EQUIVALENT WHICH IS A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS. ANOTHER WAY FOR CSU TO FURTHER REDUCE ACCESS UNITS WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A STUDENT CAN. TAKE AND REPEAT A COURSE. FOR BETTER GRADE -- MOST CAMPUSES ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE THE SAME COURSE FOR UP TO THREE TIMES STUDENTS TYPICALLY ARE ALLOWED TO REPEAT UP TO TWENTY EIGHT UNITS OF COURSE WORK IN THIS WAY. WE RECOMMEND ENACTMENT OF A SYSTEM WIDE POLICY THAT LIMITS STUDENTS TO TAKING THE SAME COURSE FOR BETTER GRAY TWO TIMES. WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALREADY THE POLICY AT A NUMBER OF OF CSU CAMPUSES. AND I ACTUALLY I KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE FROM GIVEN WHERE YOU'RE FROM US CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO IS LOOKING AT REDUCING CURRENTLY THEY ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE A COURSE THREE TIMES FOR A BETTER GRAY AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT REDUCING NEXT TO SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT SALMON A DINO. IS LOOKING TO DO -- AND GIVEN THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DOESN'T CURRENTLY COLLECTED ON UNITS ACCUMULATED DURING TO DO TO COURSE REPETITION THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE CS YOU REPORT THIS DATA. AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT THAT OUR RELEASES IN MARCH TYPICALLY THANK YOU [inaudible] WELL. GIVEN THE FACT THAT I'M AS OLD AS METHUSELAH -- HIGH -- THIS CONCEPT OF TAKING COURSES TWO OR THREE TIMES TO GET A BETTER GRADE IS -- SOMETHING THAT I'D NEVER HEARD OF UNTIL I CAME TO CALIFORNIA SO. BUT OF COURSE SAID YOU KNOW I WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE DARK AGES AND I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. OR MAYBE I TO HAVE A BETTER CAREER SOMEWHERE. CAN CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT IS THAT A REAL PROBLEM HERE IN THE STATE I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND -- MAYBE DID SO WELL THAT YOU DON'T NEED A CLATTER HAVING YOUR APPEARING OVERLY KIND -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS WELL SO I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO A LOT OF GIVEN THE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CAMPUS IS THAT -- CLOGGED UP IMPACTED AS WE SAY AND TRYING TO GET STUDENTS AND SEATS AND MEET THE MILLION. BACHELOR'S DEGREE SHORT TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY YOU WE NEED THE SORT OF FIGURE OUT IS A IS A BE GOOD ENOUGH OR DO I NEED TO HAVE AN A AND YEAH THAT TYPICALLY DOES NOT HAPPEN AND I WOULD SAY IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS OF ALL OF THE ISSUES. WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE LOOKING AT SCARCITY OF ACROSS ENROLLMENTS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND ALSO WITH COURSE TASTING COURSE COURSE TAKING WERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES REALLY LOOKING AT THAT KNOWING THAT IF YOU TAKE EXTRA COURSES -- YOU MAY BE TAKING THE SEAT OF SOMEONE ELSE ESSENTIALLY SO THERE IS SOME INSTANCES OF STUDENTS REPEATING A COURSE FOR EXAMPLE IN AN AREA THAT'S VERY COMPETITIVE LIKE NURSING. BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE USED TO HAVE ON THAT WHEN THE PREVALENCE OF THAT HAS GONE DOWN TREMENDOUSLY. OUR CAMPUSES ARE REALLY MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT -- YEAH THEIR POLICIES ARE LIMITED WHAT DO WE HAVE SYSTEM WIDE DATA AND IF NOT -- MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD E OF INTEREST CERTAINLY IS OF INTEREST. TO ME AND AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS ASSIGNMENT THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE MAYBE THAT'LL AND SOON -- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO START COMPILING SOME SYSTEM I DID IF IN FACT IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S WHY IT'S FOR OUR AN ISSUE THAT'S WIDESPREAD I'M NOT CALLING IT A PROBLEM I MEAN IT'S JUST TO BE CLEAR THE POLICY OF THE CAMPUSES. IS FOR STUDENTS THAT ET A THE THAT FAIL WE'RE GONNA DE OR EVEN A C. MINUS SO IF THEY GET A A C. MINUS. THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REPEAT THE COURSE IF THEY GET SAY ANOTHER SEE MINUS A. B. L. LOUD REPORT THE COURSE AGAIN CURRENTLY IF THEY DO GET AN A OR B. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REPEAT A COURSE FOR THE PROBLEM CAMPUSES. CAMPUSES I'VE SPOKEN WITH HAVE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS THEIR NOT DOING STUDENTS ANY FAVORS IF THEY'RE THEY'RE FAILING THEY TAKE A GANDER FAILING AGAIN. THERE NEEDS TO BE A DISCUSSION ACTUALLY. HOPEFULLY EARLIER ON AND WHEN THE STUDENT GETS SAID INITIAL LAUGH ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STUDY SKILS LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR MATH SKILLS -- OR ENGLISH SKILLS IS THIS REALLY THE RIGHT MAJOR FOR YOU BUT IF IF YOU ALLOW THE STUDENT TO FAIL. FAIL AGAIN AND THEN TAKE IT A THIRD TIME WHAT CAMPUSES. ARE SAYING IS. NOT NECESSARILY DOING STUDENTS AND WITH AN EXPLANATION AXES VERY VALUABLE TO ME SO FROM A SYSTEM WIDE STANDPOINT I MEAN WHAT. THE THE SO THE POLICY ALLOWS COURSES TO BE REPEATED BUT I MEAN IS THERE SOME. SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT THAT AND THEN ATTACH IS TO THE STUDENT AT THAT POINT. TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER OR MORE SUCCESSFUL RESULT IN IN DO YOU HAVE THE THE COUNSELING STAFF TO DO THAT ARE YOU UNDER FUNDED DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT I MEAN. THERE IT SEEMS TO ME THEN BASED ON THAT EXPLANATION THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE. LEVEL A SERIES OF ISSUES THAN THAT THE POP ON THE RADAR SCREEN AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY IT AND THAT'S PART OF MY LARGER TESTIMONY ON THE INTENTIONALITY SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. THIS IS ONE ISSUE I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE IT NO BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- EVERY ASPECT OF A STUDENT'S ACADEMIC CAREER NOT TO MENTION WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. THE REAL SPIRIT OF THE GRADUATION THIS OF IS TO HAVE US LOOK IN A DIFFERENT WAY. OF HOW WE'RE SERVING OUR STUDENTS -- AND WE'RE DOING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO WHAT I SHOULD DO IS LET YOU MOVE OF WHOEVER'S NEXT BUT YOU MOVE ON TO YOUR LARGER TESTIMONY AND THEN I'LL. HOLD MY QUESTIONS OR IS IT YEAH. WONDERFUL ALTHOUGH I'M ENJOYING THIS YEAH ME. TOO BUT GO AHEAD YEAH CITY THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS REALLY A A PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY TODAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WE SAT -- COLLECTIVELY AS A SYSTEM SOME OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS STUDENT SUCCESS SCHOOLS ACROSS THE NATION. AND EQUITY GOALS SUCH THAT -- BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL BE BEAT THESE GOALS WE WILL STAND ALONE AS THE PREEMINENT FOUR YEAR PUBLIC COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE NATION. WITHOUT PEERS WHEN TALKING ABOUT GRADUATION RATES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLETION SO WE REALLY SET THE BAR HIGH AND I'M I'M FOR MARK I'M I'M I AM THRILLED TO PRESENT. SOME REMARKABLE RESULTS THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR SO ACROSS THE BOARD NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT OUR GRADUATION RATES WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRST TIME STUDENTS. WE'RE TALKING MATTER TRANSFER STUDENTS AND WHETHER YOU LOOKING AT MALES FEMALES ALL GENDERS ALL RACES WE ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS FOR COMPLETION RATES. I MEAN THIS IS REALLY REMARKABLE IN HISTORY THE CSU THERE IS CURRENTLY NO BETTER TIME TO BE A STUDENT YOUR OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IS GREATER NOW. THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME WHICH IS SIMPLY REMARKABLE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE AT THE LA A A LA -- MENTION AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTENTIONALITY RASO LOOKING DEEPLY AND TURNING EVERY STONE IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE CLASSROOM AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IN A POSITIVE WAY AFFECT OUR MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS OR STUDENTS OF COLOR. ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- AND THE SUCH AND SO IT'S BEEN A REMARKABLE TRAJECTORY SO FAR I CAN TALK ABOUT THE BIG NUMBERS BUT BUT SPECIFICALLY YEAR OVER YEAR. FOR THIS LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE DATA AND TING OVER THE LINE OVER THE SUMMER WE GRADUATED -- A HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES WHICH WAS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THAT -- THE YEAR BEFORE IN TERMS OF UNDERGRADS AND PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE IT'S EASY FOR US TO THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS LIKE THAT BUT SEVEN THOUSAND LIVES SOME THOUSAND FAMILIES SEVEN THOUSAND COMMUNITIES AND THEN THINK ABOUT THE RETURN TO THE STATE. AND SO THIS IS BUILDING UPON YEARS AND YEARS OF THAT INTENTIONALITY THAT I MENTIONED A REALLY CHALLENGING OURSELVES -- TO BETTER FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING TO SING THAT IT'S PAYING OFF ACROSS ALL OUR CAMPUSES. SO YOU MAY ASK I ALWAYS ASK HOW DO WE GET THERE IT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THEIR THE COMPLICATED ANSWER I TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VARIATION CAMPUS TO CAMPUSES. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP THAT THAT THAT ARE -- EMPLOYING DIFFERENT THINGS BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON FOR HIGH LEVEL ITEMS. ONE IS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THIS LAST FALL MARKED A REALLY A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR US IN TERMS OF OR ACADEMIC PREPARATION POLICY. WE CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE SERVE STUDENTS WHO WE USED TO DO HIM AT IS NOT READY. WE USED TO TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY TO BE AT THE CSU YOU NEED TO TAKE REMEDIAL COURSES THAT DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS YOUR DEGREE THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. YEAH I'M VERY PROUD OF THE SYSTEM AND MORE PROUD OF THE FACULTY WHO ARE FAIRLY SHORT NOTICE CHANGE THEIR CURRICULUM. LOOKED AT THE WAY THAT WE WERE TEACHING A PROVIDED THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR STUDENTS OF THE MESSAGE CHANGE FROM YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY TO BE HERE AND IF YOU DON'T GET READY WITHIN A YEAR YOU'RE GONE TO WERE READY FOR YOU. WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SUCCEED ED WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WITH YOU AND SO IT'S EARLY I WANT TO CAUTION US ON OUR LEADERS WE JUST IMPLEMENTED THIS IN THE FALL. BUT LOOKING AT THE FIRST TERMS WORTH OF DATA SO THIS LAST FALL -- IF YOU LOOK YEAR OVER YEAR IN A COMPARISON LAST YEAR BEFORE THIS POLICY WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO CAME TO US IN NEED. OF EXTRA SUPPORT WHO -- COMPLETED A LITTLE LESS THAN A THOUSAND WHO COMPLETED A COLLEGE LEVEL MATH COURSE. THIS YEAR THAT SAME GROUP OF A UNDER -- THAT STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT BETTER WE GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE MATH COURSE RIGHT AWAY. AND EIGHT TIMES THAT AMOUNT ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS A YEAR OVER YEAR COMPLETED THAT FOR CREDIT MATH COURSE SO THEY'RE NOT SPINNING THEIR WHEELS THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY WITH MOMENTUM TOWARDS THAT AGREES SO. AGAIN INCREDIBLY PROUD OF OUR CAMPUSES AND PARTICULARLY OF OUR FACULTY FOR PULLING THAT TOGETHER AT COMPLETED AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL THE COMPLETED EXCEPT AT A COLLEGE LEVEL COLLEGE ON THE MAP OR SO INSTEAD OF TAKING A PRETTY BACCALAUREATE. NON CREDIT COURSE THAT DID NOT COUNT THESE ARE FOR CREDIT -- BOB GLORIA LEVEL COURSES IN MATHEMATICS SO JUST TREMENDOUS AGAIN THAT SUPPORT -- MEANT THAT INTENTIONALITY AROUND -- SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF POLICIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SECOND EXAMPLE IS REALLY LEADERSHIP -- I THE PLEASURE BEING UP HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO FOR A PRE HEARING AND JUST ANECDOTALLY FOLKS AROUND THE TABLE WERE SAYING HOW ON THEIR CAMPUS VISITS THEY NOTED THAT. TO A PERSON THAT THEY MEET WITH THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. SO I THINK THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT THAT'S THE LEADERSHIP ON CAMPUS THAT'S OUR FACULTY REALLY BUYING INTO WHERE WE'RE HEADED ITS COLLECTIVE MOMENTUM. THE THIRD THING I'LL MENTION IS DATA. WERE AT A POINT NOW WHERE WE ARE COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA ON IMPEDIMENTS TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND ALSO AREAS OR THEIR SUCCESSFUL. ENSURING THAT BROADLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WE HAVE A SYSTEM DASHBOARD WERE EVERY FACULTY MEMBER. CAN LOOK AT THE COURSES THEY TEACH IN THEIR MAJORS AND THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND SEE WHAT IS THE GREAT DISTRIBUTION FOR STUDENTS IN MY CLASS OR OTHER CLASSES ARE THEIR EQUITY ISSUES ARE THERE BIG DIFFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GRADES THAT FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING VERSES THEIR PEERS AND IF SO HOW CAN I LOOK UPON MYSELF. TO PERHAPS CHANGE THE WAY I TEACHER PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS THEY'RE STARTING TO HAVE REAL STRONG INTENTIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPROVEMENT. THE LAST AREA HOW IS IT BEEN RECEIVED I ASSUME. FACULTY HAD TO BUY INTO THAT HOW'S IT BEEN RECEIVED INCREDIBLY WELL I'LL TELL YOU ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES WE HAVE IS. WE'RE SUCH A MISSION DRIVEN ORGANIZATION OUR FACULTY IN MANY CASES COME TO US BECAUSE OF OUR MISSION. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO BETTER BECAUSE OF THE STUDENTS WE SIR AND SO PUTTING DATA IN FRONT OF THEM THAT ARE PERSONAL TO THEM. IN MANY CASES OPEN THEIR EYES AND AND THEY'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF OF THAT INFORMATION. THE LAST THING I'LL JUST MENTION IN CLOSING IS RESOURCES WE COULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE RESULTS WE HAVE WITH OUR RESOURCES AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE BUDGET -- THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND THE LAST FEW YEARS OF FUNDING THAT WE'VE HAD IT'S A LOUDEST TO HIRE ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY. IT'S ALLOWED US TO OPEN UP THE NEEDED SECTIONS THE STUDENTS CAN GET THE COURSES THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE ADVISERS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON THE DATA INVESTMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS THAT YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AS WELL. BUT I WILL SAY IF IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS SAY THAT STUDENT SUCCESS IS NOT FREE. IT DOESN'T COME EASY THIS PROGRESS -- IS IN JEOPARDY IF WE DON'T GET FUNDING AND CONTINUE FUNDING WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THOSE COURSES -- YOU KNOW AND I JUST SAY THAT AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE HEARING AND LISTENING A LITTLE BIT THIS MORNING TO SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON I'M CONVINCED I'M BIASED BUT I'M CONVINCED THAT THERE'S NO BETTER INVESTMENT THAN THAT -- AND INVESTMENT IN THIS THE STUDENTS OF THE CSU WHAT CAN YOU -- THERE IS A DELTA OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS -- BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FORTY FIVE AND WHAT THE ISSUE RECEIVED IN THE PAST AT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WHAT IS THAT DELTA THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY REPRESENT IN TERMS OF A GRADUATION INITIATIVE? PROGRAMS IN IMPACT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS WITH THAT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO LAUNCH AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED COURSE ACTIONS WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO -- THE YOU KNOW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS IN THE SECTIONS AND SO -- YOU THIS IS REALLY PART ONE OF THE COURT WITH IF YOU TALK TO STUDENTS AND I KNOW MANY WILL TESTIFY LATER. ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS TO GRADUATING FOR THEM IS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE COURSES THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. AND SO FOR US THIS IS HIRING THE FACULTY THAT WE NEED TO HIGHER SO THAT WHEN A STUDENT NEEDS OF COURSE WE CAN MEET THEM WHEN THEY ARE. AND OFF FROM THE COURSES THEY AND THESE WOULD BE COURSES OFFERED BOTH WHAT I WOULD CALL DURING THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC YEAR OF SEPTEMBER THE JUNE AND ALSO IN THE SUMMER SESSIONS AS WELL ABSOLUTELY YEAH. WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THE COURSES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO GET OUT THE DOOR. AND IT'S OUR OBLIGATION. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROPERLY RESOURCES SYSTEM SO WE ALLOW STUDENTS TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE. AND HOPEFULLY THE FINISH LINE ON TARGET WHICH I KNOW IS WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON WHETHER IT'S A SIX YEAR TURGOR FOR YOUR TARGET. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN TO YOU AND I WE'RE WORST WERE SINGING THE SAME TUNE HERE SO WHEN WE SPEAK WITH THE CAMPUSES WE SAY IT'S OUR JOB TO ADVOCATE FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU'RE DOING. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THERE ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES AND TRY TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID PIECE THAT THE LA -- MENTIONED -- WITH THE SYSTEM ALLOWS -- THERE. I I WOULD CALL TO DISCONNECT BUT IT'S NOT A DISCONNECT WITH NO ONE FAULT ANYONE FOR PROVIDING STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID. CERTAINLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. BUT APPARENTLY THIS THE SYSTEM PROVIDES INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIALLY THAT EXCEEDS THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE PROVIDE CAL GRANTS. AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADD SOME CAL GRANT TIME TO THE PROCESS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO GET PEOPLE OUT THE DOOR BUT SEPARATE APART FROM THAT CAN YOU ADDRESS THE INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIALLY CALICO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S. THAT'S ONE POLICY THAT WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'VE BE INSTITUTIONALLY AT FOR A LONG PERIOD TIME JUST IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. AS MUCH ACCESS AS WE CAN I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE ARE CONCERNED AND I I I'VE BEEN TO JEFF WOULD AGREE WITH ME ON THIS. AS ONE OF OUR GRADUATION ISSUES OURS IS THAT AND YOU GUYS ARE BUT YOU'RE HERE CLOSE TO IT BUT BUT THE ONE THING THAT -- IS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT -- PRECARIOUS IS THE THE HARD -- STOP OF A OF A CAL GRANT. FOUR YEARS OF ELIGIBILITY PERIOD AND NO SUMMERS. IN NO SUMMER ONLY UNLESS YOU AND TO SHOOT RIGHT. NOW ALTHOUGH THE THE ONE THING THAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO DO IN A WAY KIND OF A WRAPAROUND. INTENTIONALITY WITH INSTITUTIONALLY OUR STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT IN IN FACT SOME INSTANCES WHERE STUDENTS HAVE RUN OUT OF THEIR CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUDGET. PUT THEM OVER INTO OUR STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT TO GET THEM THROUGH BECAUSE ONE THING THE THE THE I THINK THE ONE OF THE GREATEST. TRAGEDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS THOSE STUDENTS TO HAVE A HUNDRED TEN UNITS THEY'VE COMPLETED OR HUNDRED AND YOU KNOW TOWARDS DEGREE. AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF TIME AND COMMITTEE COLLEGE OR ANOTHER YOU YOU KNOW. LIVE STUDY. THEY DECIDED TO USE FINANCIAL AID AND AND THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR FINANCIAL AID. THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL KILLERS WOULD BE IF THERE'S ALWAYS INVESTMENT ONE BY THE STATE BY THE STUDENT AND THENALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF THE FINANCIALLY DRIES UP. INCLUDING THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANTS WE WOULD BE VERY WE WILL BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO CHANGE THAT POLICY WELL YOU AND I AND KEEP AND KEEP. KEEP THINGS AFFORDABLE YOUR ATTORNEY CRITICISM FROM MAY IN FACT -- YOU KNOW THOSE OF US UP HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS BUILDING -- PROPONENTS OF INCREASING RATHER THAN DECREASING. STUDENT FINANCIAL AID IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE LA WAS RECOMMENDATION IS IS FINE TUNING IS IS NOT WORTH FINE TUNING BUT IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT TOO THOUGH WELL I'M THINKING THAT IT'S MORE OF OF CHANGING THE FOCUS LATELY IT SEEMS TO ME THE FOCUS IS NOT ON THE AMOUNT. OF STUDENT AID OR THE LENGTH OF IT. IT'S ON THE COUNSELING THAT'S PROVIDED TO STUDENTS TO TRY TO KEEP THEM FOCUSED REDUCE EXCESS UNIT ACCUMULATION. FOCUS MOVING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM BEGINNING TO END AND GRADUATION AS AS AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. NOT REDUCING NECESSARILY THE STUDENT AID IT'S IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE. INSTITUTIONALLY THE JURY WILL PROVIDE OVER ABOVE THE CAL GRANT PROCESS SO GOOD ON YOU. AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROPERLY RESOURCE COUNSELING TEAMS ON CAMPUSES. TO KEEP STUDENTS FOCUSED. TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS EARLY WHO ARE FAILING COURSES IN A BEEN A MAJOR THAT THEY SELECTED THAT THEY PERHAPS ARE NOT. A CLIP TO TO TO MOVE FORWARD IN AND AND SHIFT THOSE STUDENTS EARLY QUICKLY INTO SOMETHING THAT IS A IS A VIABLE CAREER FIELD. AND MOVE THEM ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TO GRADUATION I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE WE GOT A SPENDER. TIME AND ATTENTION. ANYWAY ANY OTHER ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ENJOY THE CONVERSATION. THIS IS THE HOLDOVERS ITEM AS WELL WE WILL AGAIN REVISIT THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR PROJECT REBOUND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT PROJECT REBOUND WHICH IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. WERE EITHER SEEKING ATTENDANCE AND ENROLLMENT OUT OF CSU OR CURRENTLY ATTENDING AND ONE OF NINE PARTICIPATING CSU CAMPUSES. AND THANK YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THAT YOU KNOW WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION HERE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND ARE -- IN MAY POPULATION AND OBSTACLES TO POST INCARCERATION IMPLEMENTS AND HOW WE KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF OUR A PRISON AND JAIL SYSTEM AND CERTAINLY EDUCATION. AND OCCUPATION AND ABILITY TO PRACTICE WHAT THEY LEARN IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE INTENSELY FOCUSED ON HERE IN THIS IS A KEY PIECE OF THAT SO. SIR MUST BE YOU. OIL OIL WHAT'S OF THE LA OKAY FIRST I'M SORRY I'VE I'M GETTING OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I'M TALKING. BUT THERE'S LIMITED. CENTRALIZED DATA ON PROJECT REBOUND BUT BASED ON A RECENT SURVEY OF CAMPUSES BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GRADUATES OF PROJECT REBOUND APPEAR TO HAVE STRONG ACADEMIC EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. GIVEN THE STATE'S INTEREST IN REHABILITATING OFFENDERS WHICH YOU JUST. MENTIONED MR CHAIR THE LEGISLATURE MAY AGREE THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THIS. GROUP OF STUDENTS IS IS HIGHLY AS A HIGH PRIORITY YOU TO BE SERVED AND IF SO. THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING IT'S QUITE SMALL I REALISTICALLY IT'S ENOUGH FOR ONE OR TWO STAFF. YOU KNOW. TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO RATHER THAN PROVIDING THIS AMOUNT LEGISLATURE COULD ENCOURAGE CSU TO LEVERAGE THE MUCH LARGERPOT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH WHICH WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. POTENTIALLY UP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD ENCOURAGE CSU TO LEVERAGE THIS MONEY THIS GRADUATION INITIATIVE MONEY -- AND USE IT FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS THROUGH PROJECT REBOUND DOING SO WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT CAMPUS IS. ALREADY DO HOWEVER HOW THEY ALREADY USE GRADUATION INITIATIVE MONEY FOR OTHER AT RISK STUDENTS SUCH AS FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE ENROLLED AT CSU IN THAT HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMS. AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND RECEIVE GRADUATION MONEY OR USE GRADUATION MONEY FOR THESE PURPOSES. SO WE WE DOES RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGE CSU TO PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON USING GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROJECT REBOUND LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO SEE IF YOU TO REPORT. MORE REGULARLY ON PROJECT REBOUND. ENROLLMENT IN ROMAN AND OUTCOMES HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED AT WHICH CAMPUSES. WHAT ARE THE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES WHAT ARE THE JOB OUTCOMES OF THESE GRADUATES AND OF COURSE DATA ON RECIDIVISM? OF ALL THAT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATURE TO KNOW AND BE ABLE TO MONITOR YEAH I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL I MEAN I'VE I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM THAT. SORT OF CROSSES A VARIETY OF VERY BUDGET AREAS APPEAR IN INTEREST AREAS OF MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE -- TO THE EDUCATION POLICY COMMITTEE [inaudible] AND IN Y LIMITED EXPERIENCE WHAT I HAVE FOUND IS DATA SOMETIMES DRIVES [inaudible] BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CENTRALIZE THE DATA COLLECTION IDENTIFY WHAT THE DATA POINTS ARE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO SIDE WITH THE PROGRAM IS PROPERLY RESOURCE STE. WHETHER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED OR COMPELLED AND AND HOW MUCH I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE BEST USE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR WHATEVER IT IS IT WINDS UP IN THE BUDGET MAY BE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT HAS DATA POINTS THAT REPORTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND INFORMS THAT COULD INFORM DECISIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON FUTURE BUDGETS BUT THAT'S JUST MY GENERAL OBSERVATION BUT I THINK SIR IT'S NOW. YOUR TIME. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR BRADY HEINER I'M A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FULTON -- AND THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PROJECT WE'VE DONE A CAL STATE. FULLERTON I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM. OF SOME SPEAKING TO YOU -- TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE -- FROM NINE CAMPUS PROGRAMS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND BEFORE I ENTER INTO MY REMARKS TO SPEAK -- TO THE COMMENT THAT YOU JUST MADE ABOUT PERHAPS THE BEST USAGE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN IN CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET -- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- MIGHT BE -- TO COLLECT COLLECT DATA -- I WILL SAY THAT SO THUS FAR WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A GRANT TO THE RP OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTE WHICH COMES TO A CONCLUSION IN JUNE -- AND SO -- WE WOULD LOVE -- AND HAVE BEEN -- UP PLANNING -- TO DO HOLISTIC -- FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE PROGRAM EVALUATION BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE IN MORE ROBUST -- QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE -- WAYS THE THE SUCCESS THAT WE'RE SEEING ON ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD -- TO DO THAT -- AND SO REALLY -- THE BEST USE OF ANY US STATE ALLOCATION THAT WE MAY RECEIVE IT AND AND AND OUR VIEW IS IS REALLY -- TO FUND THE THE THE PERSONNEL -- FOR FOR OUR PROGRAMS WHICH WILL GET INTO -- IN A IN A MOMENT HOPEFULLY YOU'LL TELL ME WAS SO IT'S ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND THAT'S GOING AWAY -- YES IN JUNE SO HOPEFULLY YOU IN YOUR REMARKS WILL TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT GOES WAY BECAUSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS NOT ONE POINT SEVEN SO. INDEED INDEED -- SO LET ME -- LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE NEWSMEN MINISTRATION -- FOR INCLUDING THIS ON GOING -- ALLOCATION FOR PROJECT REBOUND -- IN THE COMING YEARS BUDGET - AND TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DO -- AND WHY WHILE HELPFUL -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S ALLOCATION. FALL SHORT OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO SUSTAIN AND SCALE ARE PROVEN MODEL OF SUCCESS -- MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MISSION OF PROJECT REBOUND IS TO SUPPORT THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION -- OF THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR PHILOSOPHY IS THAT THE LEADERSHIP AND MENTOR SHIP OF OTHER FORMERLY INCARCERATED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND GRADUATES. FOSTERS A SENSE OF BELONGING AN ACHIEVEMENT AMONG OUR FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS THAT MAXIMIZES -- THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS. THIS IS WHY WE STAFF OUR ON CAMPUS PROGRAMS WITH TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WHO LIKE OUR STUDENTS. HAVE AN INCOME I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CAR SERRATION -- AND WHO EXEMPLIFY THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TOWARD WHICH OUR STUDENTS A SPIRE. UP PROJECT RUBEN WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY -- BY A SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR NAMED JOHN IRWIN -- AFTER SERVING FIVE YEARS IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM FOR ARMED ROBBERY -- WHEN EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM UCLA A PHD FROM UC BERKELEY -- AND ESTABLISH PROJECT REBOUND AS A PATHWAY TO MATRICULATED THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED INTO THE CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY -- OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THROUGH AS I MENTIONED THE OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTES RENEWING COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE. NINE CAMPUSES OF THE CSU COLLABORATED THE PILOT THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM MODELED OFF THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. OF THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM CURRENTLY INCLUDES -- PROGRAMS AT CAMPUSES -- IN BAKERSFIELD -- FRESNO FULLER TEN LOS ANGELES POMONA SACRAMENTO -- MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR DISTRICT IT'S SAN BERNARDINO -- SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO -- SO THESE PROGRAMS NOW PROVIDE A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF SUPPORT FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIST THEM IN ESTABLISHING EDUCATIONAL PLANS A APPLY FOR ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID. SOCIALLY RE INTEGRATE AND ULTIMATELY GRADUATE. FROM THE CSU. MOST OF ALL PROJECT REBOUND OFFERS A COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMAS OF PRISON AND NOW FACE A MULTITUDE OF SOCIAL BARRIERS RELATED TO HOUSING. EMPLOYMENT TRANSPORTATION FOOD AND COMPUTER LITERACY BARRIERS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DERAIL THEIR LIVES AND AND LEAD TO RE OF REST. OUR PROGRAMS WORK. THE STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAM DO NOT RETURN TO PRISON AFTER THREE YEARS OF OPERATION THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM AS A 0% RECIDIVISM RATE. BY COMPARISON THE THREE YEAR RECIDIVISM RATE -- AS I'M SURE -- IS IS NO NEWS IN THIS ROOM IN CALIFORNIA IS 50%. THE RECIDIVISM IS JUST A MINIMAL METRIC OF OUR STUDENT SUCCESS OUR STUDENTS NOT ONLY DESIST FROM CRIME THEY NOT ONLY PERSISTENCE SCHOOL THEY EXCEL. PROJECT REBOUND REDUCES ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AMONG STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED AND EDUCATIONALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. OUR STUDENTS 60% OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO HAVE EARNED AN OVERALL GRADE POINT AVERAGE OF THREE POINT OH NEARLY EVERY SEMESTER. THAT'S ABOVE THE CSU STUDENT BODY AVERAGE. AT CAL STATE FULLERTON -- WHERE I'M HOUSED THE THAT TO ADDRESS HIGH RATES OF HOUSING AND SECURITY AMONG OUR REENTERING STUDENTS? PROJECT REBOUND HAS PILOTED THE FIRST REENTRY HOUSING INITIATIVE FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE NATION. AND AMONG OUR STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE HOUSING SUPPORT THE OVERALL GRADE POINT AVERAGE IS THREE POINT. SEVEN THROUGHOUT THE CONSORTIUM PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS HAVE SECURED SCHOLARSHIPS VOLUNTEERED FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LANDED INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS -- IN THEIR FIELDS. BY THE END OF NEXT MONTH THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM WILL HAVE GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN JUST THREE YEARS. DURING WHICH TIME THE ENROLLMENT IN OUR PROGRAMS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. 87% OF A PROJECT REBOUND GRADUATES SECURE EMPLOYMENT OR ENROLLED IN POST GRADUATE PROGRAM. SO IN CONCLUSION -- AS I MENTIONED -- LET ME JUST SAY THAT NOW IS I BELIEVE THE CRUCIAL TIME -- FOR CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN PROJECT REBOUND -- IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR -- THAT PHILANTHROPIC SEE GRANT THAT I MENTIONED WILL COME TO A CAN CONCLUSION -- AND A HANDFUL OF OUR PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO SHE WILL BE FORCED TO SHUT THEIR DOORS IN THE ABSENCE OF ALTERNATIVE LONGITUDINALLY SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF SUPPORT. AS I MENTIONED GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S ALLOCATION WELL WELL HELPFUL IT'S STILL FALL SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT OF THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. NEEDED TO SUSTAIN WHAT WE'VE BUILT AND MEET ICREASING DEMANDS WERE NOW OPERATING ON NINE CAMPUSES MANY OF WHICH ARE STAFF WITH ONLY PART TIME STAFF -- AND THERE ARE SEVEN ADDITIONAL% CSU CAMPUSES -- WHO HAVE -- HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH US -- P TO THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL WHO ARE INTERESTED AND SOME -- HAVE ALREADY BEGUN -- ORGANIZING -- IN VARIOUS WAYS TO TO LAUNCH -- PROGRAMS ON THEIR CAMPUSES -- WOULD IF PROVIDED -- THE SUPPORT TO DO SO -- SO WE WE REQUEST -- THAT -- THIS ON GOING ALLOCATION OF FOR PROJECT REBOUND -- BE INCREASED TO ENABLE US TO SUSTAIN AND SCALE -- THIS PROVEN MODEL OF SUCCESS TO BUILD SAFER COMMUNITIES -- AND A STRONGER ECONOMY UP FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS -- BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I'D I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE JASON BELL. OF REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF PROJECT REBOUNDED A MAN WITH OVER A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE -- FOSTERING HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS AMONG FORMALLY -- INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- TO TO TESTIFY. OKAY WILL DO THIS I THINK YOU CAN USE THAT MY CREDITOR SIR. IS THIS ON ITS OWN. SO SO I I GUESS I COME TO YOU TODAY AS A AS A LESS THAN TRADITIONAL COLLEGE GRADUATE FROM SAM CISCO STATE THE THE LONGEST STANDING PROJECT REBEL CAMPUS. AT JOHN LECTURES TO DEPARTMENT SOMETIMES. THREE AND IN THIS POSITION I FIND MYSELF IN IS THE THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR DIRECTED TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE SAME MODEL THAT WE'VE DONE AND UTILIZE FOR YEARS THAT SERVICES WILL STATE. ONE WHEN I SAY NONTRADITIONAL KIND OF JUST ONE OF A WALK YOU THROUGH THE THE THE PERSONAL. JOURNEY THAT IT TOOK TO GET TO THIS PLACE. BECAUSE OF THE AS A YOUNG PERSON I WAS DOING EVERYTHING IN MY POWER. TO AVOID COLLEGE. I HAVE TO MEET IT IS KIND OF A MIRACLE TO GET HERE. AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH REBOUNDS SPECIFICALLY. SO SO IN IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A YOU KNOW I'VE COME TO THAT THE REALIZATION THAT COLLEGE WAS NOT FOR ME I WOULD NEVER SMART ENOUGH TO BE THAT SHOULD AYE JUSTIN BELONG AS WELL THE FOLKS. AND THE IN IN THINKING LIKE THAT WHAT I CALL IT STINKING THINKING. MAKE IT COST ME DEARLY AND BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I MADE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL MAINLY BECAUSE MOMS WOULD ALLOW ANYTHING OTHER OTHER THAN THAT IN THIS WORLD GIRLS WEDDING AND I COULD PLAY BASKETBALL. BUT BUT THE REALITY OF IT I MADE IT THROUGH AND AND BUT SHORTLY AFTER AT AGE TWENTY I FOUND MYSELF FACED A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MAKING SOME. SOME PRETTY BAD MISTAKES. NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T ACCEPT THE DEAL OF LIFE FIND OF GOING TO TRIAL IN COMING OUT WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT THE THE REALIZATION IS THERE'S STILL A LOT OF YEARS THAT I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AND AND AND BULL FORTY OR EITHER SUCCUMB. TO THE THIS PRISON LIFESTYLE IN AND MAYBE NEVER MAKE IT. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL REALITY OF OF ACCEPTING THAT IS HARD I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE REPUTABLE PEOPLE NOT NOT MAKE IT TO IS SOMEONE CUT THEIR WRISTS SOME OF THEM. JUST SUBMITTED TO PRISON POLITICS AND END UP CATCHING A WHOLE BUNCH MORE TIME. BUT BUT THE KEY THAT TEETERING POINT FOR ME WAS AND IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF OF SAN QUENTIN CARSON SECTION IT WAS A IT WAS A BROCHURE THAT HAD A OLD BROCHURE FROM PROJECT REBOUND AHEAD A LITTLE STORY ABOUT JOHN -- WENT. AND I READIT AND IT HAD TO ADDRESS ON IN IN THE KINDA SPARKED SOMETHING IN ME SO I I DIDN'T NUMBER ONE I DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT COLLEGE. I FOUND OUT ABOUT SOCIOLOGY THROUGH WRITING. PROJECT REBOUND AT THE TIME THE DIRECTOR WAS A LADY NAME -- KINDA WALKER. WHEN SHE TAUGHT ME WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW SHE BASICALLY? IS SOME ACADEMIC ADVISING THROUGH THE MAIL TO TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERATED AND AND A MAJOR. AND AT THAT POINT I KIND OF HAD SOMETHING TO TO DIRECT MY MY JOURNEY TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S HARD. TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME NEXT CHRISTMAS OR THE ONE AT THE END OF THE ONE AFTER THAT AND I HAD QUITE. QUITE A FEW OF THOSE TO DEAL WITH. AND BUT AT THAT POINT IN FIGURE IN THE WHAT MY JOURNEY WAS ABOUT AND AND THAT I CAN. I WOULD LIKE A NATURAL BORN SOCIOLOGISTS AND DIDN'T KNOW IT. AND SO I HAD SOMETHING TO AIM TO WHAT AT THAT LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL KIND OF GOT ME THROUGH THAT TIME AND I DID THAT. AND WHEN I FINALLY ARRIVED ON THE CAMPUS AFTER. AFTER NINE AND A HALF YEARS LATER OF OF SERVING THAT CALIFORNIA PRISON SENTENCE. I FELT COMPLETELY EMPOWERED AND BEING AROUND FOLKS THAT HAD HAD GONE TO THE JOURNEY THAT COULD. HELP ME AND GROOM ME TO TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PERSON OUTSIDE OF THOSE PRISON WALLS BECAUSE I JUST REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. I WAS AT A DIFFERENT STAGE OF MY LIFE SO I KNOW WHAT HE DID I LIVE THROUGH IT NOT ONLY TO ONE DEGREE WITH A SECOND DEGREE AND TO THE POSITION THAT I'M IN NOW AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN SUPPORT OF WHOLE WENT TO OTHER FOLKS. TO DO JUST THE SAME IS IS IS AMAZING TO ME SO IF I CAN STRESS ANYTHING I JUST WANNA STRESS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND AND WHAT IT'S DONE FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS NOW BEING ABLE TO SEE IT ON ALL THESE OTHER CAMPUSES GO. TO LAND ON ANY OF THE NINE CAMPUSES THAT ARE EXISTING AND THE SEVEN POTENTIAL ONES THAT AWAITING. AND KNOW THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENERGIZED AROUND DOING POSITIVE THINGS OUTSIDE OF PRISON. I FEEL IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT RE ENTRY WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF HIGHER IT I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER FOR EVERYONE. BUT I THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY HAS TO BE. ON THE TABLE AND I THINK CALIFORNIA SERVES AS A AS A PRESS IS A LIKE A LIKE A MODEL FOR THE REST THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE ALL THE DIFFERENT -- SYMPOSIUMS EVERY EVERY USE SUMMIT THAT I GO TO OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE FINDING OUT ABOUT US IN THIS IN THAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT YOU DO HERE SO I THINK THIS IS LIKE LIKE BRADY WAS SAYING THIS IS THE TIME. TO STEP UP AND DO THE BEST WE CAN IF I COULD SAY. ANYTHING ELSE TO THAT REGARD I THINK THAT. THIS PRETTY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING IS VERY IMPACTFUL. THANK YOU MISTER ST THOMAS AND ST GRADUATIONS. WHAT DOCTOR ALL I CAN SAY IS A GREAT JOB THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO MAYBE WE SHOULD? PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF THE REST OF OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE -- YOU EAT I PREFER TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY BUT BUT I'M BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- AT THROUGH THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM -- I THINK IS THAT A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE -- AS MY COLLEAGUE MISSION -- AND CAN SCALE -- A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT CAN REALLY SERVE AS A BELLWETHER MODEL TO OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE I'LL JUST SAY SO WE'VE WE'VE LOST THAT HOUSING INITIATIVE THAT I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS -- IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD -- REPRESENTATIVES FROM FOR UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY COME TO SEE -- WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE DOING -- AND AND IT WITH AN INTEREST AND AND AND IN REPLICATING -- WHAT WE'RE DOING WELL EXTRAORDINARY JOB AND YOU DID ANSWER MY QUESTION -- THE LOSS OF THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. UNLESS IT'S REPLACED WILL RESULT IN A SYSTEMATIC OF DISASSEMBLY OF AT LEAST A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS PROGRAM AT THE VERY SEE ISSUE CAMPUSES AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE CANNOT AFFORD IN THE STATE OF FOR INTERESTED IN. TRULY INTERESTED IN REHABILITATION -- AND RESTORATION. AND GIVING FOLKS OF LEGO -- OKAY MANUALLY MARK IS LIFE WE DO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN THE STATE ON REHABILITATION AND SEEMS TO BE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY -- TO TAKE SOME OF THAT THAT WE SPENT ELSEWHERE PERHAPS NOT QUITE AS EFFECTIVELY AND DIVERTED TO TO YOUR PROGRAM AND PROPERLY FUNDED AND ACTUALLY ADD SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SET UP A DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK THE DATA. AND THE DATA POINTS -- WHICH I'M SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT AND AND AND DISSEMINATE ARE GOING TO BE A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT TOWARD WHY. OF THIS PROGRAM SHOULD CONSIST CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING THAT ONLY IN THIS NEXT BUDGET YEAR BUT AND BUDGET YEARS AFTER SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. OKAY -- ANYTHING ELSE PANELIST ON THIS PARTICULAR. YES SENATOR DISTRO QUICKLY FROM A SYSTEM WIDE PERSPECTIVE -- OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM -- WE ALSO WERE. ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO PARTNER WITH THE OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTE -- TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM I THINK ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND -- A AND MAYBE EVERY A SPECIAL REQUEST IT SEEMS LIKE YOU AND OTHERS. ALSO IN THE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE POISED TO TO FUND. OF THIS PROGRAM -- ONE THING THAT I REQUEST THAT WAS IS THAT IT BE ON TOP OF THE FULL FUNDING OF A AT OF OUR GRADUATION IT SHOULD HAVE. ONE THING THAT E HAVE ALREADY LAID OUT IN THE GRANT INITIATIVE PLAN. IS WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THAT FUNDING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR. AND RIGHT NOW OUR CAMPUSES ARE POISED TO DEDICATE ABOUT SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECT REBOUND AND OTHER -- PROGRAMS LIKE THAT THAT ARE KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT TO STUDENTS THAT COME FROM A DIVERSE GROUP OF OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WOULD JUST REQUEST IS THAT IF YOU FULLY FUND THE GRANITE SHOULD BE ALMOST GET A TWO FOR WITH THIS ONE IS THAT YOU WE DO HAVE CAMPUS IS THAT ARE POISED TO DO MORE WITH. YOU KNOW DHAKA STUDENTS -- WITH VETERANS AND THOSE SORTS OF GROUPS SO THEY'RE ALREADY LANE THAT THAT THAT THAT WOULD GROUNDWORK BUT THEN ALSO IF YOU ARE POISED TO FUND THIS IT'D BE ON TOP OF THAT. A GRAND SHIP ABOUT RATHER THAN SUPPLANTED REPLY I CERTAINLY AGREE I MEAN THIS IS NOT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE AND PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND I'M HOPING THAT MY PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- CONSULTANTS ARE LISTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE TRADITIONAL AS I UNDERSTAND IT I'VE NEVER SEPTEMBER CHAIRED IT BUT THAT'S WERE TRADITIONALLY THE REHABILITATION MONEY PASSES AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY PASSING THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN. THROUGH ANOTHER PIPELINE. WHERE WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIND -- THE MONEY TO FUND THIS PROGRAM AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT IS WITH RESPECT TO REHABILITATION OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. I CAN I HEAR YOU -- AND I COMPLETELY AGREE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AS WELL AS MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OKAY FAMILIAR FACES AND ONE NEW ONE SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. RANDI KATZ SUPPORT OF FINANCES TO CATS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THOUGH THE CSU MAY I USE THAT SUPPORT APPROPRIATION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS IT'S JUSTIN NEEDS OF FACILITIES THAT SERVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION A EXISTING LAW ALLOWS USE YOU TO FINANCE THE COSTS OF DEFERRD MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY CSU SUBMITTED TWENTY TWO CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST INCLUDING THEIR STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH FUNDING AVAILABLE THE APPROVED BY THE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FINANCES PROVIDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL FOR ELEVEN QUALIFYING PROJECTS INCLUDING THE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS -- CURRENT LAW LIMITS ISSUES CAPITAL EXPENDITURESTO NO MORE THAN 12% OF ITS SUPPORT APPROPRIATION NOTED THAT SIR. ONCE FUNDED THE PROJECTED MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE WILL BE NINE POINT 7%. WHICH IS ABOUT EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN BOND DEBT SERVICE AND CASH. FOR THE S. SAN DIEGO DRAMATIC ARTS INNOVATION PROJECT OF FINANCE NOTES THAT CSU SPACE GUIDELINES AUTHORIZE ALL CAMPUS. THOSE WITH ENROLLMENT EXCEEDING FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SUCH AS THIS YOU SAN DIEGO THAT BOTH A FIVE HUNDRED SEAT SMALL THEATER AND A BLACK BOX THEATRE. THE BLACK BOX THEATRE ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE STAGE CONFIGURATIONS GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY TO WHOSE PRODUCTIONS SUCH AS THE EARNED AROUND THE SIDLES AND DANCES THAT MAY NOT WORK AS WELL IN A TRADITIONAL THEATER -- IN ADDITION TO THE THING LAW -- IS THIS IN ADDITION TO THE CAP OUT LATE PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- OR TWO AND PROUVER EXPAND -- CAMPUS BASED CHILD CARE FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT STUDENT PARENTS -- BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING. A PROPOSED CSU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING AND ASSOCIATED PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT OF THE SPENDING ITS USES SIDE OUTCOMES. HOWEVER WE DO NOT A CONCERN WITH THE BREAST AND SOME OF THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU. WHAT'S YOUR FROM THE LA -- AND I'M. TWO GLEE INTERESTED IN THE SUGGESTION ABOUT THE PLAN TO ELIMINATE BACKLOG. BUT I WOULD CHOOSE. I WILL NOT DERAIL YOU AND I WILL KEEP YOU ON TRACK PAT IS TO TWO MAJOR ISSUES HERE FIRST CAPITAL OUTLAY THE PROPOSALS AND THEN. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- INCLUDED WITH THAT I GUESS IS THAT IT IS THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES. SO WITH REGARD TO CAPITAL OUTLAY WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE PROJECTS THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS PRELIMINARILY APPROVED. AND CSU IS INDICATED THAT IT CAN FINANCE. THESE PROJECTS WITHIN ITS EXISTING BUDGET. I DO TO US SOME DEBT REFINANCING AND SOME OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN. WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS OF THE PROPOSED. PETER PROJECTS AT SAN DIEGO. A AS NOTED ON PAGES TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE OF THE AGENDA THE PROJECT ENTAILS RENOVATING. AN EXISTING FEEDER TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND I CONSTRUCTING A SECOND THEATER. IN ADJACENT LOCATION. BY BUILDING A SECOND THEATER THE CAMPUS WOULD BE ABLE TO STAGE MULTIPLE -- PERFORMANCES AT THE SAME TIME. THE CAMPUS IS WRITTEN PROPOSAL NOTES THAT AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE JUST TO RENOVATE THE EXISTING THEATRE. AND NOT A AT THE SECOND THEATER AND THIS ALTERNATIVE ACCORDING TO THE CAMPUS WOULD COST ABOUT HALF OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PULMONARY PRELIMINARILY APPROVED FOR THIS PROJECT SO. ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS LESS SO IN ASSESSING THIS PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT JUST WANT -- TO WAY WHETHER THE BENEFIT OF HAVING TO THEATERS. OUTWEIGHS THE ADDITIONAL COST AND THE OTHER POTENTIAL PROJECTS THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED WITH SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND CHANCES OFFICE MIGHT HAVE OTHER INFORMATION YOU. YOU COULD CONSIDER IN EVALUATING THE PROPOSAL. THE REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL -- WE THINK. SAID THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A IS A PROVEN WAY TO USE ONE TIME MONEY. AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE TWENTY ONE OF THE AGENDA WE DO THINK THAT MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. IS WARRANTED IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SO TO THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BE CLEAR -- KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME WHAT PROJECTS ARE CSU INTENDS TO UNDERTAKE AND AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS. HAS PROVIDED SOME GOOD INFORMATION -- INDICATING OF THEIR TOP PRIORITIES FOR THIS MONEY SHOULD THEY RECEIVE IT. ON WE ALSO RECOMMEND HAVING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORT AFTERWARDS ON THE STATUS OF THE PROJECTS. IS HE IS HE SAID IT WAS GONNA UNDERTAKEN WHETHER THEY WERE COMPLETED OR NOT -- WE ALSO RECOMMEND -- DIRECTING CSU DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN. TO ADDRESS ITS BACKLOG THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BACKLOG AND ALSO. I'LL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW IF IF THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO PUT MONEY INTO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEN THE PROJECTS THE CURRENT BUILDINGS DON'T HAVE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE IS UNDERTAKEN YOU'RE GONNA END UP WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALL OVER AGAIN IN LESS YOU ADDRESS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS. ON TIME MAINTENANCE USING FUNDING THAT THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. AS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON MAKING THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR CHILD CARE FACILITIES. HI THE LEGISLATURE WILL JUST WANT TO KNOW BASIC INFORMATION -- WHAT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE THERE AT THE IT IT BUILDINGS ON CAMPUS IS WITH CHILD CARE FACILITIES? WHAT SPECIFIC? FACILITY UPGRADES WOULD NEED TO BE DONE -- WHAT WOULD BE THE COST OF THAT OF JUST BASIC INFORMATION LEGISLATURE ALWAYS ASK FOR FOR ANY PROJECT WHETHER IT'S THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT LARA MAINTENANCE PROJECT? HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS WELL. FIRST LET ME ADDRESS THE THEATER I MEAN I'M NOT AN ARTS PERSON I DON'T HAVE AN ARTS DEGREE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE THE SMALL LIKE IS THE REFERRED TO AS BLACK BOX THEATERS OR SEEM TO BE. A THING NOW -- COMMUNITIES ARE CONSTRUCTING THE ADDITION TO LARGER SCALE AUDITORIUM TYPE FACILITIES SO. I ASSUME THERE MUST BE SOME EDUCATIONAL REASON. WHY YOU WOULD -- WANT THE FACILITY LIKE THAT IN SORT OF HARD FOR US TO JUMP IN THE MIDDLE OF ACADEMIA AND TRY TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR A FROM AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I ASSUME THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL. THE FACILITY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES NOT COMMUNITY ENTERTAINMENT. NECESSARILY THIS IS THAT THAT THAT. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN IS TO THE LARGER ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THANK YOU FOR DRESSING THE PLAN. I IT'S ALMOST SO BIG I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND I CAN'T GET MY ARMS AROUND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES YOURS AND SEE ISSUE SYSTEM WIDE AND AND THE UC SYSTEM. ARE YOU RECEIVING ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO THE COMMENT ABOUT. STATUS QUO ARE YOU RECEIVING ENOUGH MONEY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. KEEP THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING. AND IF NOT WHAT'S THE PLAN. SO SO ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WEEK WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. TO IT WILL PROVE THE ROUTE THE ACCURACY OF OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AMOUNT SO THAT IS HAS BEEN DOLLARS WE'VE BEEN INVESTING. OF RECENTLY AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE'VE HAD THIS UPDATE OF THE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THIS ISSUE AS MUCH AS WE TOOK SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE NEW TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE PRODUCED. A STAFFING END. OF INVESTMENT OF PHYSICAL PLANT WE WE ALSO THEN REALIZE WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB BECAUSE OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE NOT LASTED FORTY FIFTY YEARS ARE STILL GOING. SOAK BUT THOSE ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE. A LOT OF OUR BUILDING STOP WAS BUILT IN THE SIXTIES WITH THE THE GROWTH OF THE CSU BUT WE DO HAVE I WANNA SAY 15% OF OUR INVENTORY THAT ARE SIX YEARS OLD OR MORE. SO SO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ANNUAL AMOUNTS THAT WE NEED TO REINVEST TO REPLACE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE COME TO THEIR END OF AGE IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. THREE FIFTY THREE SEVENTY OF IT AND THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS. THAT'S JUST OF THINGS THAT ARE COMING OF AGE THAT YEAR. IT DOESN'T ADDRESS. TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT THE THE BACKLOG THE THREE POINT. SEVEN IF WE INCLUDE THAT THAT NUMBER GOES UPWARDS OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR AND YOU RECEIVE CAREER WHAT WOULD BE RECEIVING ON THIS BUDGET WELL IN THIS BUDGET TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION SO WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS. WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS HOWEVER. BREAKING THOUGH THIS IS RECORD BREAKING IN TERMS OF ONE TIME DEFERRED MADE BUT NO I'M LISTEN I'M I'VE. I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THE GOVERNOR'S DONE IN THIS BUDGETS OF NOTHING I SAY SHOULD BE DEEMED CRITICISM I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET A HANDLE ON THIS NOW EVERYTHING IS BUDGET CONSTRAINED AND I I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE GOVERNOR AND I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW. OF HE OR THEY BALLOTS THE VARIOUS -- STAKEHOLDER -- REQUESTS AND FEND OFF THE HANDS THAT ARE TRYING. TO GET IN THE BUCKET BUT I AM CURIOUS SO. YOU NEED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. RIGHT IT AND SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BUDGET REQUEST THIS IS INCLUDED I MENTIONED EARLIER. IS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS AND BASS FUNDING FOR A FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT WOULD BE ONE IF WE HAD INCREASE SUPPORT BUDGET FUNDING. THEN WE COULD USE THOSE DOLLARS TO FINANCE SOME OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN IN THAT IS. LARGELY WHAT IS -- SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IT WAS WHEN THE ITEMS THAT -- TO MISLI INCLUDED IN THE AT WITH THE AGENDA. YEAH THOSE ARE ITEMS AT THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE. REFER BOND FINANCING. OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE A LIFE OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF THIRTY YEARS FORTY YEARS FIFTY YEARS BASED ON HOW LONG WE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE U. SO FAR. SO OUR REQUESTS REALLY OUR APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG IS ASKING FOR PERMANENT BASE SPENDING SO WE CAN FINANCE -- SO FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GONNA GET TO IT IN. AND TO INCREASE OUR BASE FUNDING. WE GET PROJECT WHO HAS FROM TIME TO TIME IS THERE A IS THERE A WRITTEN LONG TERM DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PLAN THAT. IT'S SORT OF BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH AND REDUCE TO WRITING -- WHETHER IT INCLUDES BOND FINANCING OR ONE TIME MONEY OR FUTURE ANTICIPATED BUDGET REQUESTS -- THE GENERAL FUND. WE HAVE WORKED ON A PLAN OVER TIME IT DOES SOMETHING THAT FALLS TO THE BACK BURNER SPARSE COMPLAINING THAT REPORT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN IS A BY CAMPUS LIST OF WHAT THE BACKLOG IS PER CAMPUS FOR THE BUILDINGS. AND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE WORKED ON RECENTLY FOR THE PIPES BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS AND AND WHAT THAT COST IS THE WITH THEIR LIFE CYCLES WERE STILL. WORKING ON THAT ASPECT. AND WE IDENTIFY HOW MUCH EACH CAMPUS SHOULD BE FUNDING AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE'RE NOT OUT THAT AMOUNT THAT WOULD EQUAL THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUT TRYING TO INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THE NUMBER. AND WE'RE NOW TRACKING. WE'VE OF CHANGE SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SO WE CAN TRACK HOW MUCH ARE YOU SPENDING CAMPUS ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WE CAN BETTER YOU KNOW MAKE A JUSTIFICATION ON HOW MUCH WE NEED AND ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LEGISLATURE ILIO. DID WE SPEND IT DID WE NOT YOU WHERE WE FALLING SHORT. AND I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE CONSTANTLY HARP ON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS A MINUTE IT'S A IF IT. IF THE IF. IF THERE'S A PLAN. AND IF THE REPORTS ARE CLEARER AND PRESENTED TO US THAN IT IT ALLOWS US TO HELP. YOU HELP YOURSELVES IN TERMS OF FUNDING BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. IN CASE YOU TWELVE PER PUPIL SPENDING IN HIGHER EDUCATION YOU KNOW. DIRECTING FUNDS GRADUATION IS INITIATIVES INCREASED ENROLLMENT BUT IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES WE HAVE IF WE DON'T HAVE FACILITIES IN WHICH TO DO THE TEACHING. UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO PITCH TENTS. WE DON'T ACCOMPLISH OUR CORE MISSIONS SO. IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN THE BUILDINGS THAT YOU HAVE. LET ALONE BUILD THE NEW ONES THAT YOU NEED TO BUILD IN ORDER. TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASED ENROLLMENT THAT WERE PRESSURING YOU [inaudible] TO TO ACCOMPLISH SO. THANK YOU AND JUST FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE ON THE PLAN THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE RIGHT MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR THIS WOULD WE WE ARE FUNDED BY TWO PRIMARY SOURCES. STATE GENERAL FUND IN TUITION FEE REVENUE RIGHT. SO WHEN -- AND I KNOW THAT NOBODY AT THIS TABLE AND NOBODY ON THE DÃ­AS ONCE TUITION TO GO UP EVER. BUT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY IS WE HAVE TUITION THAT SUPPORT US. SO IF THAT'S OFF THE TABLE AND IT IS OFF THE TABLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ALREADY. AND WE HAVE ALREADY PULLED THAT OPTION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY OFF THE TABLE AS WELL. THAT A FALLS ON THE GENERAL FUND WHETHER THE GENERAL FUND COULD SUPPORT THAT SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PREDICAMENT THAT WERE IN AS A STATE UNIVERSITIES WERE FUNDED BY. TWO REVENUE SOURCES ONE THAT'S VERY LIMITED AND HAS TO PAY FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN THE STATE THE OTHER ONE THAT. MOST FOLKS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING CREE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A PLAN AND ACTUALLY FUND. NO I UNDERSTAND. AND YOUR CHALLENGES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOWN SO EVERYBODY'S IN THE SAME BOAT TRYING TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT WILL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IT. ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM YES MA'AM. IF I MAY I AM. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- WITH THE LEGISLATION CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE THE CSU COULD USE ITS OWN FUNDS TO FINANCE CAPITAL WE DID THEN START INCLUDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PLANNING IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN. SO NOT ONLY FORWARD LOOK AT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BUT ALSO I CAMPUS HOW MUCH THEY'RE LOOKING TO SPEND OF THEIR OWN MONEY HOW MUCH WE WOULD PUT IT. OF FINANCE DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND AS FAR AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OF COMMENT ON REPORTING WE ALSO INCLUDE. WHAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE CSU FROM THE STATE? THE WEAVER SEE ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS SO THOSE PROJECTS ARE IDENTIFIED BY CAMPUS. SO THAT SINCE WE DO TRY TO BE TRANSPARENT ON HOW WE USE THAT AUTHORITY AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS BY CAMPUS. I DO WANT TO TOUCH BASE ON THE SAN DIEGO PROJECT. WE WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN DEFINING THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT. SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS NEW. NEW PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY ADDRESS EIGHTY EIGHT PROBLEMS IN THE TOWN HALL THEATRE. BUT IT WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS EIGHTY A PROBLEMS IN THE EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENTAL THEATER AND THE DANCE STUDIO SO THOSE ARE. TWO IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO SAN DIEGO STATE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT IT'S VERY -- HILLY SO WE HAVE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE ENTRANCES AT MULTIPLE LEVELS. CURRENTLY THE DON PAL FEEDER AND SOME THE OTHER THEATERS YOU HAVE TO GO IF YOU'RE A DISABLED PATRONS. YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING TO ACCESS THE RESTROOM WHICH IS NOT UNIVERSAL ACCESS. SO THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. IN AN ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES. WE THINK IF WE INCLUDED THE COST TO BRING THOSE OTHER -- RECITAL HOLES AND DANCE STUDIOS UP TO EIGHTY EIGHT COMPLIANCE FIRE SAFETY CODES IT WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE THE DELTA SEVENTY MILLION REDUCE THAT DOWN. TO MAYBE SIX TO THE NINE MILLION BECAUSE OF THE COST TO IN PROVE THE OTHER SPACES. AND SO IT SO I THINK THERE ARE CERTAINLY EIGHTY ACCESS BENEFITS. THERE IS A MAN OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF BY VIRTUE OF THIS PROJECT. AND THE STUDENTS HAVE CAN'T GET INTO THE DISABLED STUDENTS CAN'T GET INTO THE LIGHTING STUDIO SO IT'LL ADDRESS. THE ACADEMIC PORTIONS OF THE PROJECT THAT. CAN'T BE ACCOMMODATED CURRENTLY SO WE WE SEE HER SUPPORT ON THAT PROJECT. AND ON THE CHILD CARE CENTERS WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM CAMPUSES THIS IS WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS WE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE. OF THE NUMBER THE CAPACITY OF STUDENTS CHILDREN. CURRENTLY WE HAVE PROPOSALS THAT RANGE FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THIRTY MILLION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO THE PATRONS ARE IS THAT THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE THEIR CHILDREN'S IN THE FACILITY. OR IS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS A FACULTY STAFF. AND CAN OPERATIONALLY EVEN IF BY FROM CAPITAL WE INCREASED IT CAN OPERATIONALLY THEY THEY ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASE BUT WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE STATE OWNED FACILITIES. THAT -- COULD BENEFIT FROM FROM SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS -- SO IT'S A WIN WIN. I ASSUME THAT THE NEEDS VERY CAMPUS BY CAMPUS. THEY THEY DO THE PROGRAM'S VARIOUS WEALTH OF SOME CAMPUSES HAVE MORE OF A OF A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM KINESIOLOGY WHERE WHERE OTHERS MAKE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT COMPONENT IN A SHOP IN A STATE FACILITY. WELL THANK YOU ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. I APPRECIATE PRESENTATION WILL HOLD THIS ONE OPEN LOOK FORWARD TO REVISITING THIS -- AS WE MOVE DOWN THE ROAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THE FINAL ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER -- SEVEN BASIC NEEDS WELCOME BACK. WE DIDN'T DRIVE YOU AWAY. NOW. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS OR TO SUPPORT CSU CAMPUS EFFORTS. TO ADDRESS FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. IN A SURVEY OF CSU STUDENTS CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND 200017402% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS REPORTED HAVING FOOD AND SECURITY ABOUT REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WITHIN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. HAS PAGE TWENTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA NOTES RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR CAMPUSES. TO HELP STUDENTS ENROLLING CALIBRATION WHICH IS THE STATE'S FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM. AS WELL AS OPERATE OF FOOD PANTRIES AND CREATE MEAL SHARING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES VARIOUS CAMPUSES OFFER OTHER SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES TO STUDENTS. SEARCHES EMERGENCY HOUSING AND HOUSING VOUCHERS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THOSE SERVICES IN FRONT OF YOU WITH A HAND OUT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. YES YOU STUDY FOUND AT LEAST AT THE TIME. THAT MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WERE UNDER UTILIZED FOR EXAMPLE THREE QUARTERS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED BY RESEARCHERS AS FOOD IN SECURE HAD NEVER HEARD OF OR NEVER USED A FOOD PANTRY. IN YOUR AGENDA ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWENTY SIX DESCRIBES OTHER FINDINGS FROM CS USE LATEST LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON THE ISSUE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION OLLARS ONE TIME FOR BASIC NEEDS FOR PHIL CS USE BUDGET REQUEST. CSU INDICATES THAT WOULD USE THE MONEY TO EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS THAT SPECIALIZE. IN A WORKING WITH FOOD AND SECURE AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IDEA WOULD BE FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CSU STUDENTS AND LINK THEM. WITH COMMUNITY RESOURCES. WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HERE FIRST THE ISSUE OF SUSTAINABILITY. ASSUMING CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO USE THIS MONEY THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO REACH OUT. TO NEIGHBORING -- AGENCIES TO FORM PARTNERSHIPS THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT OKAY WILL ONCE THAT RELATIONSHIP IS STABLISHED. HOW WILL BE MAINTAINED? IT'S THE MONEY RUNS AWAY SO HOUSE A KIND OF SUSTAIN IN THAT WAY SECOND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH FOR CSU TO ESTABLISH CLEAR. GOALS TARGETS AND METRICS ALSO THE LEGISLATURE CAN ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT UP FOR CSU BASIC NEEDS I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE SURVEY THAT FOUND. THIS SURVEY FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT CSU CONDUCTED. HOW A LOT OF THE SERVICES IN FRONT OF YOU ARE? UNDER UTILIZING LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO KNOW OKAY IF THE LEGISLATURE PUTS IN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR HOWEVER. MUCH. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OUR OUR STUDENTS STARTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SERVICES AND AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE SERVICES? THIRD THERE'S REALLY THE OF A MUCH MORE STEPPING BACK A MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE ABOUT HOW STUDENTS. PAY FOR COLLEGE OF FINANCIALLY FINANCIAL AID IS THE PRIMARY WAY STUDENTS PAY FOR BASIC COSTS WHICH IS ROOM AND BOARD. CURRENTLY. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HEARD -- JUST TWO WEEKS AGO -- NEAR YOU SEE CARRYING CURRENTLY YOU SEE PROVIDES MORE AID FOR LIVING COSTS AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IS ABLE TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO AND STUDENTS AT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAY HAVE TO WORK LONGER HOURS OR TAKE OUT MORE LOANS IN ORDER TO COVER. THEIR COSTS SO DESPITE YOU SEE HAVING THE MOST RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS LIVING COSTS. THE GOVERNOR'S ONLY PROPOSING ONGOING RESOURCES FOR YOU SEE AND ONE TIME AGAIN FOR FOR CSU IN AND ACTUALLY NO FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR BASIC NEEDS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO PRIORITIZE ON GOING FINANCIAL AID ASSISTANCE TO CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THE STATE PROVIDES FOR THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD WHICH IS. WHICH IS A GRANT THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEE IN CSU STUDENTS USED DISPROPORTIONATELY RELATIVE TO YOU SEE. SO IT'S TAKING A LOOK AT FUNDING. FOR STUDENTS WITH THE MONEY THE STUDENTS RECEIVE AND HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND OF FIND THE FOOD AND THE HOUSING THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS. OR A AND CAL GRANT BE FOR THE FIRST YEAR THIS TUITION ONLY IS. I FOR THE FIRST YEAR CAL GRANT BE IS IS -- THEY RECEIVE A GRANT AND ACCESS GRANT OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY DO NOT GET TUITION COVERED IN THAT CASE -- IT'S LIVING EXPENSE YEAH IN THAT CASE IT WOULD BE THE CSU STUDENT UNIVERSITY GRANT THE INSTITUTIONAL LATER YOU SEE THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD WOULD PAY FOR THAT AND SPACES WAS LIVING EXPENSES RELATED COSTS FOR THE FIRST YEAR UNDER BE RIGHT. AND GET ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION OVER THE YEARS THANK YOU. YES MA'AM HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MAD DENISE BADLY OVERSEAS STUDENT WELLNESS AND THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE. FOR THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. I THIS IS THE BASIC MEANS INITIATIVE IS A SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT TO COORDINATE SERVICES ACROSS CAMPUSES I TO HELP REACH ALL STUDENTS IN NEED OF SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE IS STRUCTURED AROUND A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK INVOLVING FIVE KEY AREAS. ADDRESSING THE MEDIA NEEDS OF STUDENTS. GROWING CAMPUS BASED BASIC NEEDS SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN REACH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SCALING UP PRESS PRACTICES FROM ONE CAMPUS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND FINALLY ENSURING LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF BASIC NEEDS SERVICES. SO AS AN EXAMPLE OF A MEETING AND AND NEED IMMEDIATE NEEDS -- FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH FOOD AND SECURITY ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES DO HAVE EITHER A FOOD PANTRY OUR FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. ALL CAMPUSES PROVIDE CAL FRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE HEALTHY EATING OPTIONS. AND IN FACT FROM AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN TILL THE END OF JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WERE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE STUDENTS SERVE THEIR ON CAMPUS FOOD PANTRIES. AND A MAJORITY OF OUR CAMPUSES ALSO OFFER MEALS HEARING OR MIL VOUCHER PROGRAMS MEANING THAT A STUDENT CAN GIVE -- OR DONATE A MEAL SWIPE FROM THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL MEAL PROGRAM TO ANOTHER STUDENT IN NEED SO DURING THAT SAME TIME WE HAD ABOUT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED MEALS THAT WERE DONATED IN FIVE HUNDRED UNIQUE STUDENTS. USERS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. UP FOR GROWTH WE HAD ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR CAMPUSES OFFERING ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING -- IN VOUCHERS FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING I WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL CAMPUSES THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS FACING HOUSING EMERGENCY WITH HOTEL VOUCHERS TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM RELIEF. AND THE CAMPUS ALSO CAN WILL SERVE AS A COSIGNER ON LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR STUDENTS -- IN NEED OF HELP. ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES WE'VE SEEN IT USED TO ADDRESS FOOD AND SECURITY HAS BEEN TO CONNECT STUDENTS TO SELF RASH. WE'VE ESTABLISHED HOW FRESH AS A PILLAR OF OUR BASIC NEEDS WORK BY SCALING UP OUT OF REACH SYSTEM WIDE. WE'RE PROUD THAT IN THE CSU WE HAVE TO GO STATE WHICH IS THE LEAD FOR TRAINING AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ALL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DOING CAO FRESH OUT REGION APPLICATION ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FIRST CAO FRESH CONTRACT WAS SIGNED IN CHEEK ONLY WORKED WITH ABOUT TEN CSU CAMPUSES. NOW THEY WILL BE WORKING WITH FORTY TWO CAMPUSES STATEWIDE INCLUDING NINETEEN AND THE CSU. OUR PARTNERSHIP HAVE ALSO EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY THERE ARE CLOSE TO EIGHTY UNIQUE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT OUR CAMPUSES WORK WITH NOT TO MENTION OUR CLOSE TIES WITH OUR SISTER HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION BASIC NEEDS ALLIANCE IS A COLLABORATIVE BETWEEN THE CSU UC AND CTC SYSTEM WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER PARTNERSHIP -- THIS YES YOU UNDERSTAND THE BASIC NEEDS IS A PART OF A LARGER ISSUE THAT BECAUSE GOES BEYOND OUR CAMPUS WALLS AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE NEED TO CONNECT WITH PARTNERS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM. AND FINALLY FOR SUSTAINABILITY ONE EXAMPLE WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT ON IS THAT IN ADDITION TO OUR CALVET APPLY APPLICATION -- WE ADDED A QUESTION THAT ASK FIRST TIME STUDENT. I IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CAL FRESH. JUST A SINGLE QUESTION HELPS ESTABLISH WHICH STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED AND POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S. SINCE SEPTEMBER WE'VE HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS CHECK THE YES BOX. WHICH IS A LITTLE OVER HALF OF ALL STUDENTS THAT APPLY TO THE CSU. THIS IS STABLE CHANGE ALLOWED CAMPUSES TO SEE WHICH STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN LIKELY ELIGIBLE AND WILL ALLOW FOR MORE TARGETED OUTREACH. THE CURRENT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIMEFUNDING BUDGET ASK IS ABOUT EXPANDING OUR AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE PROVIDING HOLISTIC SUPPORT AND WELL BEING. INCLUDING THE ENHANCEMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS. A FEW EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDES INTEGRATING WELL BEING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. PILOT TESTING SEVERAL HOUSING STRATEGIES CONNECTING WITH CONTINUUM OF CARE AGENCIES STATEWIDE ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BEST WAYS TO ENGAGE STUDENTS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO BE DONE HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR PARTNERSHIP DIDN'T WORK WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL AGENCIES AND STATEWIDE AGENCIES. ARE TO HELP INSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. WITH REGARD TO THE ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER PROGRAM -- OBVIOUSLY NOT ALL THE CAMPUSES EXCEPT. THAT. WHAT'S THE PLAN. TO BRING THAT OTHER CAMPUSES GIVE A TIMELINE FOR AND IS THE GOAL TO HAVE A 100% OF THE CAMPUS IS -- ACCEPTING THE BEAUTIES WE WOULD LOVE THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE USDA ABOUT THE APPLICATION FOR EBT -- AND NATIONALLY IN TRADITIONALLY IT HAS NOT BEEN THE APPLICATION IS NOT CREATED FOR COLLEGE CAMPUS FOOD SERVICE PROVIDERS -- SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT SIX CAMPUSES IN THE CSU THAT DO HAVE EBT BUT THEIR ARMS THE APPLICATION PROCESS WITH TVS. ARMY AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO STREAMLINE THAT APPLICATION IN OR CREATE A TEMPLATE SO THAT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES CAN APPLY FOR EDT ARE THOSE THAT ARE READY TO APPLY FOR EDT SO THE LIMITING FACTORS THE APPLICATION PROCESS. YES. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO FACILITATE THAT. WE ARE -- IN LIKE I SAID IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CDSS ABOUT THIS -- WE'VE TALKED TO THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- ONE OF THE CHECKS CHECK BOXES ON THERE -- ASKS WHAT TYPE OF ORGANIZATION IS APPLYING -- AND MANY OF OUR FOOD SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE PHYLLARIES SO IT DOESN'T REALLY FALL INTO THAT -- WHAT THE BOXES ARE CURRENTLY THERE I'M ALSO ASK FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHO OWNS THE STORE OR THE THE MARKET SO PEOPLE HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO GIVE THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT HAVE BEEN? A BAY AREA THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SEE THE FF AND USDA PARTNERS ABOUT. IF THERE'S A WAY TO WORK AROUND THAT. WELL I WOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D KEEP OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF POSTED ON THAT -- ONYOUR EFFORTS I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE THAT ALONG OKAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS SOON IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT -- ISSUED THESE TO BE RESOLVED FOR FOR THE SAKE OF THE STUDENTS SO. I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK JUST AS DILIGENTLY ALONG SIDE YOU. TO SEE IF WE CAN BRING THIS THING TO CONCLUSION APPRECIATE IT. I'M IN THE AREA OF HOUSING I NOTICED THAT THERE IS OF OF SOME VARIATION IN THE WAKE. CAMPUSES HANDLE -- MERGING SEE HOUSING VOUCHERS AND THE LIKE -- IF THAT'S THE CASE SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A MORRIS SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH TO THE THE HOUSING OR DID THE ISSUES VERY CAMPUS BY CAMPUS -- MITIGATE AGAINST A SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH. I'D GO WOULD BE -- OUR CAMPUSES DO VARY BASED ON CAPACITY AT A IN THE DORMS IF THERE'S CAPACITY FOR ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING THEN CAMPUSES ARE LIKELY TO DO THAT BUT IF -- THE FACILITIES ARE ALL FILLED UP -- TO STUDENTS THAT ARE PAYING FOR HOUSING THAN MOST LIKELY THAT CAMPUSES HAVE TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL HOTELS AND MOTELS TO HAVE HOTEL VOUCHERS WERE STUDENTS CAN SAY FOR A SHORT LIMÃ³N ARE LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME WELL THE YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY SO I TALK ABOUT METRICS ALL THE TIME BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIRTY TWO YEARS OF SOMEBODY BEATING IN MY HEAD WE HAVE. DO WE HAVE METRICS ON THE ON THIS ISSUE TO SIT TO MEASURE OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE IF SINCE IT'S NOT A SYSTEM WIDE. APPROACH HOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER. CAMPUSES ARE SUCCEEDING OR FAILING. SO WE'RE WORKING ON EVALUATION NOW OF SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE IMPACT IS IN LOOKING AT METRICS THAT ARE BEING CAPTURED WITH THE BASIC NEEDS WORK. AND HOW THAT OVERLAP SOME SOME OF THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS INDICATORS SO WE'RE JUST IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF FRAMING THAT OUT. AT OUR ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT OF THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO CREATE AN RFP ASSOCIATE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO INCLUDE A HOUSING COMPONENT WHAT SORT OF HOUSING COMPONENT. THIS DO YOU IN THE SYSTEM FOLKS ANTICIPATE SO WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A RAPID RE HOUSING TYPE MODEL -- WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK CAMPUS IS WE'D BE ABLE -- TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE A STUDENT WOULD BE A UC STUDENT NEED WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS RAPID RE HOUSING WHERE. THEY WOULD GET THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF FINDING -- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO MOVE IN AND THEN HOPEFULLY BUILD UP OVER THOSE THREE TO SIX MONTHS WHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THE RENT ON THEIR OWN. WHEN WE HIS WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE -- THAT IS -- ALIGNED WITH THAT EFFORT AS WELL. A MENTAL HEALTH. FIVE I'M SURE YOU SAW OUR AGENDA AND THE ANALYSIS AND I WAS. READING IT AND I WAS -- SOMEWHAT SURPRISED IN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SURVEY RESULTS -- AND I'M NOT A MATH PERSON WHICH IS WHY I'M. AN ATTORNEY I GUESS BUT WHEN I WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE SURVEY RESULTS IN THE PERCENTAGES FOR HOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE SELF REPORTING -- INTENTIONAL SELF HARM OR AT LEAST CONSIDERATION SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE ATTEMPT SUICIDE IT TOTALS ALMOST TOTAL 20% [inaudible] OF WHAT PLANS. DOES THE SYSTEM HAVE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS AND SPECIFICALLY. JUST TO ASK A COMPOUND QUESTION -- OR WERE YOU PLANNING TO ADD ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE AMOUNT IT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST PROPOSED TO BE PROVIDED. DO YOU NEED MORE MONEY FOR COUNSELORS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE STUDENT NEEDS. OF THE FACILITIES THAT YOU DO HAVE -- ON CAMPUSES ARE THERE SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES. FOR SERVICES AND ARE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT -- PSYCHIATRISTS AND COUNSELORS. PSYCHOLOGISTS -- SOCIAL WORKERS AVAILABLE. TO TO DEAL WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE IN CRISIS. A LOT OF QUESTIONS YES I I'M HAPPY TO BREAK THEM UP IF I CAN REMEMBER THE SO WAIT TIMES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM DO VERY -- IF A STUDENT IS IN CRISIS THEY'RE ABLE TO GET IN TO SEE SOMEONE USUALLY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF NOT SOONER. IF A STUDENT COMES IN AND ME ARE ASSESSED AS NOT BEING IN CRISIS THEN VERY WAIT TIMES CAN VARY FROM A DAY OR TWO TWO WEEKS. SO THAT'S WHERE THE VARIATION REALLY LIVE IF A STUDENT COMES THAT AND THEY'RE IN CRISIS RIGHT THAT IN THERE AND THERE IS TEST AS BEING IN CRISIS. THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE SOMEONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES DO YOU HAVE A PERSON THAT ROTATES THROUGH. ACCOUNTS THAT ROTATES THROUGH THAT IS ABLE TO WITH THE EIGHTH A STUDENT THAT COMES THEN THAT IS IN CRISIS AND THAT IS AS FAST AND CRISIS TO HELP THEM RIGHT THEN AND THERE. DOES THIS ASSESSMENT OCCUR. IN A STUDENT HEALTH CENTER IS A YES. AND I REALIZETHE ISSUE IS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION MAYBE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT POSITION THAN THE THAN THE UC SYSTEM. UC HAS HOUSES HEALTH CENTERS AND HOSPITALS AND UC HEALTH PLAN ALL OF THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST ON THIS IN THE CSU SYSTEM IN ON YOUR CAMPUSES SO IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. A SITUATION. SOON THAT YOUR OF FACILITY YOU HAVE LET FEWER FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL TO TO DEAL WITH THESE SORTS OF SITUATIONS JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A MEDICAL TRAINING. OFTEN INSTITUTION. OUR SYSTE [inaudible] CORRECT OKAY [inaudible] WELL OBVIOUSLY. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF STUDENTS. AND I REALIZE BASED ON WHAT I READ WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME -- EVEN THOUGH I AM AS OLD AS METHUSELAH THAT SITUATIONS HAVE CHANGED IN EDUCATION TODAY. IN ON CAMPUSES AND IN PARTICULAR ON HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS ARE UNDERS. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS AND THAT STRESS CAN SOMETIMES. MOVE INTO MORE SERIOUS SITUATIONS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PROPERLY RESOURCE -- BOTH IN TERMS OF FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS. SOME STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND THAT'S WHY I ASK ABOUT WAITING TIMES THAT'S WHY ASK ABOUT -- COUNSELORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS I'D BE INTERESTED IN IF YOU DIDN'T YOU MENTIONED THAT I MISSED IT. YOU KNOW THE VACANCY RATE ARE YOU ABLE TO RECRUIT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE YOU SEE ISSUE HOLLY'S. RECRUIT TO FILL THE POSITIONS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH WITH THE FUNDING THAT YOU ARE PROVIDED. AND IF THERE'S A VACANCY SITUATION HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT. YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK WE EITHER OF US HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON ON VACANCY RATES IN AND TURN AROUND ON THOSE BUT BUT JUST FROM A JUST COMING FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. GENERALLY SPEAKING ORIGINALLY -- THE THE C. ISSUE OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE SUPPORTED BY GENERAL FUND WAY BACK DECADES AGO. BUT OVER TIME WITH REPEATED RECESSIONS AND YOU KNOW REDUCTIONS TO THE C. ISSUE. THAT IS REALLY MY REALLY CHANGED TO A MODEL WHERE IT'S A FEE FOR SERVICE -- SORT OF MODEL SO -- TYPICALLY IT'S A FEE THAT IS ASSESSED ACROSS AN ENTIRE -- CAMPUS TO FUND THE HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE IS A LITTLE BIT A GENERAL FUND. STILL REMAINING ON SOME CAN'T SOME CAMPUSES THAT SUPPORT -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HEALTH SERVICES THE PREDOMINATELY IT'S A IT'S A FEE THAT'S THAT STUDENTS PAY FOR EACH AND EVERY YEAR -- IT WAS -- LIMITATIONS ON WHICH YOU CAN CHARGE IS A STUDENT I ASSUME IN FEET NOT STATUTORILY IN IT AND IT BECAUSE WE ARE IN BECAUSE WE ARE KIND OF A LOOSE CONFEDERATION OF UNIVERSITIES RIGHT THERE ARE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT -- RATES THAT ARE THAT ARE -- COLLECTED ON THE TO THE CAMPUSES AND SOME OF THAT IS REALLY DEPENDENT ON LOCAL OF FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOR EXAMPLE CAN OF HEALTH SERVICES FEES AT A HIGHER AND HIGHER COST A BIT HUMBLE BECAUSE THERE AREN'T SO MANY -- SEARCH COMMUNITY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM CONVERSELY IT'S IT'S LOWER IN OTHER AREAS SO JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT DID HE SAID DESCRIBING. WITH -- THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND WE THINK THAT THAT WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT AT A AT A CRITICAL POINT WHEN IT'S NECESSARY. WE DO SUPPORT THAT WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW BASS LINE FUNDING. THROUGH THESE FEES SO THAT STUDENTS CAN HAVE THE SERVICE THAT THEY NEED. AND OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE FINANCE. IS ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE OF OF SOME SOMEBODY ELSE OR SOMETHING ELSE RELIEVING PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET BUT I THINK THIS ISSUE IS IS EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND I GUESS MY COMMENT -- IS IF THE STUDENT FEE FUNDING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE. BECAUSE THEIR PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF THAT THAT CAN BE SUPPLIED FROM STUDENTS. IF THE STUDENT FEE FUNDING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS IN THE STATE I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE STUDENTS. TO EXPLORE AUGMENTING THAT -- EVEN IF HISTORICALLY WE'VE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT I THINK IT'S TOO IMPORTANT -- TO ALLOW. THE STUDENTS TO REMAIN IN CRISIS -- OR EVEN DEVELOPING CRISIS -- WITHOUT EXAMINING WHETHER WE CAN AUGMENT THAT WAS SOME GENERAL FUND SO WILL DEPEND ON THE SYSTEM TO LET US KNOW -- WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE WITH THE FUNDING THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET FROM YOUR STUDENTS AND DIVERT FROM OTHER? RESOURCES ON THESE CAMPUSES. AND IF THERE'S ADULTERER SHORTFALL -- LET US KNOW SO WE CAN EXPLORE OF TURNS WE WILL. ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS ITEM. EXCELLENT PRESENTATION THIS ALSO WAS A HOLD OPEN ITEM.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT CAMPUS THAT IS BECAUSE ON MY CAMPUS THAT IS FALSE AND MANY OTHER CAMPUSES THAT I'VE HEARD OF THAT IS FALSE -- AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PRIORITIZE A MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS. THE FAA IS. REQUESTING THAT TO THAT TWENTY MILLION BE PUT ASIDE FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- AND THAT WOULD BE. TAKE CARE -- A RATIO OF ONE FULL TIME COUNSELORS FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS -- AND I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY APPRECIATED IF YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION -- BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE COMMITTED SUICIDE -- AND A LOT OF STUDENTS AROUND. STUDENT BUT NO THOSE STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED AS WELL -- AND WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. THEIR LIVES AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT AND BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE CSU SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFERENT IDENTITIES -- THE STUDENTS DO COME WITH A LOT MORE TRAUMA AT THAT MAYBE OTHER STUDENTS MIGHT NOT -- GO THROUGH SO WE ASK YOU THAT YOU PLEASE PRIOR PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF YOUR STUDENTS THANK YOU. SHOULD YOUR REMARKS. YES SIR HI MY NAME THE LAST LITTLE -- I'M A STUDENT AT CSU CHICO -- AND WANTED TO COME AND SAY THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE TWO OF FOR THE FUNDING. TO THE 2% AND ROAMING GROWTH AND WITH THE TWO SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- ALLOCATED IS BUDGET -- HOWEVER WE ASK THAT THE GROWTH BE MEASURED INSTEAD OF HAD COME OUT OF FULL TIME -- EQUIPMENT STUDENTS TO END. UP [inaudible] WE OH SORRY WE WE ASK THAT THE GROWTH BE MEASURED BY HEAD COUNT AND SAID OF BEING BECOMING LIKE TURNING BY FULL TIME ENROLLMENT -- EQUIP INCIDENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS SPENT -- TO INCREASE AXIS AND WE **** BECAUSE LESS TO THE CSU TURNED AWAY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS YOU KNOW AND THIS FUNDING WOULD ENSURE MORE QUALIFIED STUDENTS GET A SEAT AT THE CSU -- THE GOVERNMENT A UNIVERSITY TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- OPPOSE FOR IN -- FOR ENROLLMENT -- YOU KNOW THIS IS YOU COULD PAY -- FOR SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS OR COULD PAY HEAD COUNT -- A YOU KNOW USING THE CALCULATIONS ALONE FOR FULL TIME ENROLLMENT. FULTON OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS -- YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE USING THE FUNDS THESE THE FUNDS THAT ALLOCATED IN THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE USED TOWARDS. TOWARDS ENSURING ACCESS INSTEAD OF A YOU'RE TRYING TO GET MORE CLASSES -- FOR THE STUDENTS ALREADY ENROLLED THAT CAN BE THAT THAT CAN BE FOUND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET -- WHERE THE CSU TOO YOU KNOW -- TO REALLY BE MINDFUL OF HOW LIKE THAT FUNDING WITHIN THAT WITHIN SYSTEMS ALREADY ALLOCATED -- YOU KNOW JUST WHEN I WANTED TO BRING SOMETHING SET UP SOMETHING THAT WASN'T BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW OR A SPECIFIED IN THE CONVERSATION JOE HAD ABOUT. ENROLLMENT WAS THAT YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SEVERAL CSU CAMPUSES THAT ARE IMPACTED YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM. BUT ACTUALLY BEING CSU A LADY -- THAT'S GONNA BE NO QUESTION SENTENCING -- AS A REMINDER WHEN WE INCREASE STANDARDS YOU KNOW THAT REALLY LIMITS ASPECT ACCESS FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR MONTHLY STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME STUDENTS. YOU KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THIS MIDDLE CLASS AND WHITE STUDENTS YOU KNOW WHO DO HAVE BETTER ACCESS. TO YOU KNOW AT A CITY PREP YOU KNOW EXIT EXIT OR THAT YOU KNOW INCREASES THE QUALIFICATIONS -- SO REALLY LIKE FOR THE FOR YOU ALL TO CONSIDER THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR -- GREETINGS CHAIRMAN ROB MY NAME IS DON SANCHEZ AND I'M A FOURTH YEAR SEEM TO BE GRADUATING SOON FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MARITIME ACADEMY. YEAH I WOULD HAVE THANK YOU AND I'M BE HERE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION -- THROUGHOUT MY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN BOTH A FULL TIME STUDENT AND I'VE BEEN A PART TIME STUDENT. AND AS MICHAEL YOU JUST MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING ENROLLMENT GROWTH FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- BOTH ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE CSU SYSTEM AND IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER -- IS A CENTER PRIORITY IN REMAINING TRUE TO THE C. S. HE'S MISSION. IN PROVIDING QUALITY PROTEIN -- UNIVERSITIES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- ESSENTIAL REMIND YOU THAT THE CURRENT METRICS OF USING F. T. E.'S AS A WAY OF LOOKING AT ROMA GROWTH AND LOOKING AT FINDING AN IMPROVEMENT. EVERYONE GROWTH -- HAS RESULTED IN A SITUATION WHERE WE FOUND OURSELVES WITH THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- THAT'D BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM -- SWITCHING FOR FUNDING BASED OFF OF ATTY CALCULATIONS -- INTIMIDATION BY HEAD COUNTS -- AS MY COLLEAGUE IT STATED IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ADDITIONAL HAVE ACCESS TO CSU SYSTEM -- AND I THINK. THIS IS BEEN A PRIMARY DISCUSSION IS COMMITTEE BUT AS WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT AVENUES AND DIFFERENT SOURCES AND PULLS IF WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT F. T. E.'S ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WHICH ARE HAVING MORE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS TAKE MORE UNITS THERE MORE APPROPRIATE -- RATS OF FUNDING IF WE LOOK AT OTHER METHODS THAT ARE RECEIVING A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING SUCH AS CSU STATEWIDE -- GRADUATION IS THAT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE APPROPRIATE. THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR INCREASING. UNITS PER STUDENTS RATHER THAN USING ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE KIND OF MEET THOSE GOALS AND I COURAGE IS COMMITTEE -- AS REPRESENTATIVES TO LOOK AT THE MAKE UP TO THEIR DISTRICTS -- TO LOOK AT ASPECTS OF NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHETHER THAT BE STUDENTS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND ARE SUPPORTING A FAMILY -- WORKING A FULL OR PART TIME JOB. OR WORKING OR LIVING IN A SITUATION. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ONLY TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF USE IS A PART TIME AND THEIR FOR DISCOUNTED BY F. T. E. OR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. MEASUREMENTS THAT WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE MISSION THIS UC SYSTEM. TO PROVIDE THE MOST EQUITABLE TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR ROTH MY NAME IS LILLIAN PAYS AND I AM CHAIR OF THE POLITICAL. CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS POLITICAL ACTION LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND A PROFESSOR EMERITA. FROM CAL STATE LOS ANGELES -- IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S ALLOCATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS WE HOPE INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THE WONDERFUL PROJECT REBOUND -- I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS BUDGET REQUEST. THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ALLOCATION BE DEDICATED TO THE HIRING OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY FOR THE CSU. WE BELIEVE THAT THE VERY BEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS TO HIRE MORE TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE LONG TERM FOR THE ENTIRE CAREER. OF STUDENTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH TO GRADUATION THERE IS OVER FIFTY YEARS OF RESEARCH THAT CONFIRMS THAT FACULTY WHO ARE ABLE TO MENTOR OUR STUDENTS THROUGH THEIR PROGRAMS. AND ARE GOING TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SEEING THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH TO GRADUATION WHERE ARE THOSE FACULTY GOING TO COME FROM WELL WE'VE POINTED OUT REPEATEDLY. THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT POOL OF OF FOR QUALIFIED FACULTY ALREADY TEACHING IN THE CSU ON TEMPORARY CONTRACTS ARE LECTURERS. THESE FULLY QUALIFIED TEACHER SCHOLARS COULD EASILY BE RE CLASSIFIED AS TENURE TRACK FACULTY AND HELP ADDRESS THE NEED TO THE UNIVERSITY. ATTY I MIGHT POINT OUT A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT FUNDING TO INCREASE THE HIRING OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY FOR THE GOOD OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE CSU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS MAITREYA THE DONNIE I AM A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT CHICO. I'M IN MY SECOND YEAR THERE AS A TENURE TRACK FACULTY MEMBER AFTER A TWENTY THREE YEAR. CAREER AS AN ATTORNEY. SIXTEEN OF WHICH SPENDING CRIMINAL DEFENSE AND THE LAST EIGHT OF WHICH SPENT AT THE INNOCENCE PROJECT AT THE SANTA CLARA LAW SCHOOL PRIOR TO COMING TO TO GO STATE AND I TEACH IN LEGAL STUDIES. AND I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE IN ADDITION I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND IN ADDITION TO MY INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST IN SEEING PROJECT REBOUND GET FUNDED ADEQUATELY. MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO BETTER AT NO BETTER. A REHABILITATIVE PROCESS THAN EDUCATION AND AND ON JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND COMMUNITY BUILDING THAT IS ALL PRESENT IN THE PROJECT REBOUND SEC. I AM HERE THOUGH FOR CFA TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR INTEREST IN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET. BEING SET ASIDE FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS WE SUPPORT A STATUTORY GUIDELINE NOT A MAXIMUM BUT A MINIMUM OF ONE FULL TIME COUNSELOR FOR EVERYONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AT CHICO STATE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A VARIETY OF TRAUMAS OVER THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR INCLUDING THE CAMP FIRE WHICH AFFECTED A COUPLE HUNDRED OF OUR STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY. BUT WE ALSO HAD A LOSS OF IT DEATH BY SUICIDE OF A STUDENT LAST YEAR IN MY FIRST YEAR OF TEACHING. A STUDENT WHO -- DIED BY SUICIDE FROM MY BUILDING THAT MY OFFICES AND AND IT WAS. OBVIOUSLY THAT STUDENT WAS IN CRISIS THAT STUDENT ALSO BAD EXPERIENCE GENERATED A CIRCLE. CONCENTRIC CIRCLE OF CRISIS THAT I FEEL ARE COUNSELING STAFF DID AN AMAZING JOB OF ATTEMPTING TO RESPOND TO IT AND PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT CAME IN. BUT IT REALLY WAS -- IT SHOWED HOW INADEQUATE THE NUMBERS ARE WE JUST DO NOT HAVE COUNSELING STAFF IT CSU CHICO AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT. REALLY AT MOST OF THE CSU CAMPUSES IT'S NOT TRUE AT OUR CAMPUS THAT SOMEONE CAN BE SEEN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THEY DO HAVE SOMEONE WHO WILL IMMEDIATELY RESPOND IF THEY IS A CONCERN THAT A STUDENT IS GOING TO END THEIR OWN LIFE. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP AVAILABLE FOR SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AFTER THAT ONE TIME TWENTY MINUTE. APPOINTMENT SO IT REALLY IS. CREATING AT I THINK A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR OUR STUDENTS SO I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT FULLY FUNDING THE ONE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR INITIATIVE THE TWENTY MILLION SET ASIDE. THANK YOU FOR COMING I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THIS AND DO AN ANALYSIS OF THEMSELVES. I GUESS. WE'VE CERTAINLY ESTABLISHED OUR ABILITY TO DO TO DO SO FOR INSTITUTIONS IF THEY CAN'T DO IT THEMSELVES BUT I THINK THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM -- OWES IT -- TO CERTAINLY THE STUDENTS AND ALL THE REST OF US. TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON CAMPUSES AND WHETHER THE STAFFING IS ADEQUATE WHETHER THE FUNDING FOR THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE. TO DO IT OR ALL. THREE YES OR NO AND LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN. AS A LEGISLATURE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPT TO DRIVE MORE DOLLARS. DOWN TO THE CAMPUS IS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS -- YOU'VE HEARD ME BEFORE I THINK IT'S IT'S CRITICAL AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU AND I WILL JUST ADD IN THE TWENTY MILLION SET ASIDE THE IDEAL THERE IS A NINETEEN EIGHTEEN MILLION OF THAT. IS TO HIRE COUNSELING STAFF AND TWO MILLION IS TO COLLECT DATA SPECIFICALLY ON THINGS LIKE SUICIDALITY AND OTHER CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AMONG THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU I THINK THEY'VE HEARD IS BOTH SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YES SIR AFTERNOON CHAIR ROSS -- MY NAME IS PRESTON RUDY I'M A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT SAN JOSE STATE -- AND I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO AND I AM ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE CFA CHAPTER ON MY CAMPUS. I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO IN FAVOR OF THE SEA A PHASE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL AT MONEY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO HIRE SPECIFICALLY TO HIRE TENURE LINE FACULTY. THE HIGHER DENSITY OF TENURE LINE FULL TIME FACULTY HAS A DIRECT BENEFIT TO OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS. IN GAINING AN EDUCATION TO MAKE THEM ACTIVE AND ENGAGED CITIZENS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ALLOCATION LAST YEAR OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PURPOSE. HOWEVER WE WOULD ENCOURAGE FOLLOW UP AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY. WHETHER AND HOW THAT MONEY WAS SPENT AT SAN JOSE STATE IN SAN FRANCISCO STATE IN PARTICULAR. HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY THE CAMPUS ADMINISTRATION WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY HAS GONE. TO LASTLY I WOULD SAY I AND A CFA WE SUPPORT THE PROJECT REBAPTISM GREAT PROJECT TO FUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO NOTE I I DON'T I KNOW THAT SEE A FACE YOU SEVERAL OF YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT SOME BUDGET REQUEST IS NOT ONE THAT I'VE SEEN I'M I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE FIRST FLOOR. WE ARE YEAH OKAY. SO WERE YOU YOU'LL SEE IT. YOU MAY BE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR BUT HOPEFULLY THE REST OF THE MÃ¹T LISTENING AND HOPEFULLY MAKES GOOD MUSIC. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR ROBB THANK YOU UP I'M JAKE RENDER WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. AND WANTED TO TOUCH ON A FEW POINTS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE HEARING TODAY -- ON THE POINT OF ACCESS AND HELPING SERVE MORE ELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS YOU WERE RIGHT ON THE MARK THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY GROWING STUDENT DEMAND. DESPITE DECREASING HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AN INCREASING NUMBER WHO ARE GRADUATING HAVING COMPLETED THE EIGHT THREE G. CURRICULUM TO BE READY FOR CSU. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S-GREAT EMPLOYR DEMAND AS YOU REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMENTS WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S ONE POINT SIX FIVE MILLION. COLLEGE GRADUATES THAT WE WILL LACK BY TWENTY THIRTY TO ME CURRENTLY PROJECTED WORKFORCE NEEDS. ON THE SIX THAT'S ELEMENT IN ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE BUT WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO LOOK AT THE LA US RECOMMENDATION AROUND -- DEFINING SOME GOALS AND AND TO YOUR POINT THE NEED FOR METRICS -- THAT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS THAT THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN BE NEED TO AFTER YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE -- BECAUSE REALLY RIGHT NOW WE AT THE STATE LACK ANY DEFINED GOALS FOR DEGREE PRODUCTION OR CLOSING THE RACIAL EQUITY GAPS. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR RESEARCH IS THAT IN FACT THOSE GAPS BETWEEN -- RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS ARE NOT ONLY PERSISTENT BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GROWING. AND EARLIER THIS WEEK BUDGET SUB -- TO AND THEIR AGENDA THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT SHOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE BIG GAP BETWEEN PAL AND NON PELL STUDENTS -- DESPITE GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDING SO REALLY WARRANTS -- SOME LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATION AROUND WHAT GOALS THERE SHOULD BE FOR THAT FUNDING WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE THIS FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS THOUGH. AND THEN FINALLY START TO WRAP UP MY COMMENTS HERE WE ALSO ARE VERY PROUD TO HELP CONVENE THAT CALIFORNIA UNDOCUMENTED HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION. AND I KNOW THAT'S GOING THROUGH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IT'S LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING THAT GOES THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO SERVE. THE IF YOU STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY THERE'S A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING PROPOSAL THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S INCLUDED MISS BUDGET WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT GIVEN THE ONGOING.

AND THEIR JOBS AND THEIR BY -- CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR FAMILIES. CAMPUS BASED CHILD CARE WILL ALLOW STUDENT PARENTS ATTEND THEIR CLASSES KNOWING THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE IN A SAFE AND ENRICHING ENVIRONMENT. AND PUTTING ON A DIFFERENT HAT HERE ON BEHALF OF COPYING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR FACULTY FOR BILINGUAL TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE YOU SEE CSU SYSTEMS AND OUR PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED TO EXPAND EXISTING BILINGUAL TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS OR ESTABLISH NEW ONES IF WE ARE TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF BILINGUAL TEACHERS FOR BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. INVESTING IN ADDITIONAL FACULTY WOULD ALLOW GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS TO BECOME BY LITERATE AND BILINGUAL AS PROMISED BY PROPOSITION. FIFTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA MULTI LINGUAL EDUCATION ACT AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT THERE ARE QUALIFIED BILINGUAL TEACHERS FOR E. L. STUDENTS WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER AB TEN TWELVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAY HAS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. THAT SEEKS SUCH AN INVESTMENT THANK YOU. THANKS FOR JOINING US YES SIR.
