ARM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED- SO WE WILL NOW HEAR OUR FIRST AND ONLY BILL- BY SENATOR HERTZBERG INSTRUMENTS ALREADY LEADER WELCOMING YOU MAY PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MOST DIRECTLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FUNDING. TO HOMELESS SHELTERS TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOOD AND BASIC VETERINARY SERVICES FOR PETS OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS AS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF ENDEAVORS TO TRY TO. DO WITH THIS CHALLENGING ISSUES WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WITHOUT HOMES. IS IT MANY OF THEM HAVE PETS. THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR LIVES THEY PROVIDE COMFORT AND EVERYTHING VALUABLE TO THEM. AND I'VE PERSONALLY GONE TO SOME OF THE SHELTERS WHERE PEOPLE SAY THEY WON'T GO INTO THEM BECAUSE THEY WON'T TAKE THEIR PETS. THE DATA IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AMONG DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER PROBABLY TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS HAVE PETS. SO AS WE SPEND MONEY AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO COME INTO SHELTERS THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HUMANE. AND SIMPLEST AND LEAST EXPENSIVE MATE MEASURES. I'VE HAD THIS BILL THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE BEEN UP HERE WITH THIS BUILD AND- WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE FIRST TIME WE DIDN'T DO THAT JUST I WISH THE PROGRAM BUT WE PUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND IT WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SERBS OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM. AND I'VE SEEN AROUND THE STATE A NUMBER OF THESE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OVER THE MOON. AND PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE OF IT. THE NEXT YEAR CAME BACK AND WENT TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WAS RECENTLY APPROVED IN THE BUDGET WE APPROVED LAST YEAR. ON THE FIFTEENTH AND THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE COMING UP FOR NEXT YEAR- SO DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR IT'S THOUGHTFUL IT'S INTELLIGENT YOU MAIN WORKS ON AND IT'S BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TODAY IS TO MAKE THIS PERMANENT OBVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS. BUT INSTEAD OF THAT WE BASICALLY DONE TWO PILOTS THAT I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WITH EVERYBODY ELSE SUPPORT HERE TO GET INTO THE BUDGET. BUT BUDGET SHARE. IS BUT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM PERMIT OF COURSE EACH YEAR SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION BUT TO ACTUALLY SAY WE'VE GOT SOME THAT WORKS. THAT'S COST EFFECTIVE THE TWO MAIN THAT'S INTELLIGENT. AND GETS PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND TAKES CARE OF THEIR PETS- ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MISSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND YOU HAVE A LEAD WITNESSES AND OTHER SUPPORTERS BUT- OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT SAYS SIMILAR LICENSES GRANTED JOHN OF COURSE NEVER READ ANYTHING. THAT'S GIVEN TO ME LET'S SEE IF IT SAYS YES I HAVE WITNESSES WE HAVE THE GREAT CAN CRAFT. PRESIDENT OF HOPE OF THE VALLEY RESCUE MISSION IN SANTA SAN FERNANDO IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHOSE FACILITIES I HAVE VISITED.

TO ANIMALS OKAY THANK YOU SO- EACH OF THOSE WITNESSES WILL RECEIVE TWO MINUTES- AND I ALSO YOU ARE KEY TO THE TIME LIMIT- AND SO WE WILL PROCEED TO THE WITNESSES. MR MISTER OR MADAM. THANK YOU WHICH LINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH- SENATOR WHO WAS THE CRAFT CAN CRAFT PRESENT HOPE OF THE VALLEY THANK YOU. MR CRAFTER LINE IS OPEN. GREAT WELL THANK YOU IT'S ALWAYS A PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING THAT IS CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY OF THE HOMELESS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT WE ALL SEE HASN'T PULLED AROUND THE THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG AND OTHER LEGISLATORS AND- LEADERS. WHO REALLY NEED TAKING IT SERIOUSLY- IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF. INTENTIONALLY LIVING ONE HUNDRED HOURS ON SHELTER ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES IT WAS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO WALK A FEW MILES IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THOSE TO HAPPEN THEY DID EVERY DAY. IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN ONLY REVEAL TO ME AND THAT IS STAYING SOBER AND STAYING SANE WHILE LIVING ON THE STREET. IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. JUST THE LONG. THE FEAR. OF BEING. NOT HAVING MORE NOT HAVING A WORLD. AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I WANTED MY DOG WITH ME I LOVE MY DOG AND I THOUGHT MAN I WOULD FEEL SO MUCH SAFER GET MY BOX OF DOG WAS SLEEPING NEXT TO ME. AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF OVERHEATING SIXTEEN HOMELESS SHELTERS IN THE GREATER SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. AREA AND I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THAT BY NOT ALLOWING HAD BECOME INTO THE SHELTERS WE ARE PUTTING UP BARRIERS BETTER HEALTH THAT ARE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM ENDING THEIR HOMELESSNESS. AND SO I CANNOT. STRONGLY ENDORSED. THE BILL MORE THAN SIMPLY SAYING WE NEED THIS IT IS PART OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENT IN CRITICAL PATHWAY HELPING PEOPLE IMPACTED THE STREET AND EXITING HOMELESSNESS FOR GOOD BY MAKING SURE WE'RE CARING FOR BOTH ENDS HERTZBERG SAYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO THE SECOND WITNESS. A LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON HERE WE ARE AND THE PRESIDENT AND HELPING MANY MANY MISCUES AND READ YOUR DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND QUALITY FOR THE AREA. J. FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX THE ASPCA. HUMANE SOCIETY. NORTH AMERICA TODAY IT'S ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST. THE ANTI PEOPLE AARON HE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE BELONG TOGETHER THE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT A RELIABLE INDICATOR FOR THE CAPACITY TO LOVE I CAN HEAR YOU CAN CARE FOR COMPANION ANIMAL. STRONG BONDS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND PETS MAKE FOR STRONGER COMMUNITIES. AT THE TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY STRESS AND UNCERTAINTY THE NOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS THAT PROVIDE. IN THE TRAUMA SECTION DISPLAYS OR HOME OKAY ARE CRITICAL. UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE HOUSING CREATED IN PRIOR DECADES TO PROVIDE A SAFETY NET FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING EMERGENCY HEALTH NEEDS WERE NOT DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE HAT AND YET THE BODY OF RESEARCH. HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY IN RECENT YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BY ALLOWING HAT WE REMOVED A SIGNIFICANT. DATE CABLE HOUSING. SPECIALLY AMONG THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. THIS RESEARCH SHOWS. THAT ANIMAL COMPANIONSHIP AND FORTIFYING IT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE AT. THAT HOWEVER DUE TO THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF PET FRIENDLY SHELTER DEPARTMENT HEADS HAD OWNERSHIP OFTEN AT THE BEGINNING AND BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR HIMSELF TO KEEP ALL. SENTENCE REPORT PROGRAM PROVIDES AN ELEGANT AND LOW COST SOLUTION FOR REMOVING THAT BARRIER IN FACT RARE TO HAVE SUCH A- LOW HANGING FRUIT WHEN IT COMES TO CORRECT THING. IF YOU LOOK FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE GRANT AMOUNT ALIVE DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF THE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY PROVIDED BY ECD RANGE FROM HIGH. END TO THE MAXIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND PROGRAM HE AND VERY SMALL INVESTMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DO I KNOW HOW NEIGHBORS. FROM THE STREET THEY ARE MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT. ENERGY DURING THE FIRST ROUND GRANT HE REPEATED BACK IN THE BACK RICK SANTORUM AND ALLOWING THE FACILITY DID NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY REPLICATING.
