00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.123
DEPENDENT ON ACTIVE EXECUTIVE

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.658
SPONSORSHIP.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.360
IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNOR

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:11.564
HIMSELF IS IS INVOLVED IN THAT.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.699
KEY GOALS FOR THE OFFICE ARTIST

GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:43.963
THE OFFICE WILL HAVE THE

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.231
AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.232

THE SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.545
REQUIRES A CULTURE CONTINUOUS

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.048
IMPROVEMENT.

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:03.516
AND I THOUGHT.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.518
YOU MEANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:07.520
THESE ARE TWO AREAS THE

PLAY WELL AND AND THAT'S JUST.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:11.824
BROADLY BUT CALIFORNIA IS NOT AN

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.760
EXCEPTION TO THAT.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:15.361
THE OFFICE WILL ADDRESS THOSE

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.363

ACADEMY WILL BE MANDATORY FOR

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:27.373
STATE SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.576
EXECUTIVES.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:31.477
WITH THE BREAK DOWN THE LINE TO

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.111
THE AUDIENCE THAT'S PARTICULARLY

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.512
IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR ANY OF

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.181
THESE THINGS TO TAKE ROOT YOU

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.282
NEED EXECTIVE SPONSORSHIP NEED

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.317

UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.454
WHITE OFTEN THAT THE STAFF

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.955
ALREADY UNDERSTAND THESE THESE

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.156
CONCEPTS.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:47.593
AND THEY NEED THE SUPPORT

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.562
ACTUALLY START TO THEM.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.162
WILL ALSO -- INCLUDING HERE'S

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:50.630
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.298
TECHNOLOGY TRAINING.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.566
OUR STATE STAFF AN AGILE AND

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.134
OTHER MODERN MODERN DEVELOPMENT

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.770
METHODS. TO IMPROVE SUCCESSFUL

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.105
SERVICE DELIVERY WITH A FOCUS ON

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:01.374
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.642
SO AS I SAID WE HAVE IT WITH THE

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.543
CHILD WELFARE DIGITAL SERVICE

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.046
SAYS -- WITH THAT RETIREMENT

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:08.381
YOU'VE ALREADY BEGUN INVESTING A

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.850
MODULAR THURMOND NIGEL METHOD OF

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.919
DELIVERY -- WHEN IMPLEMENTED

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.620
CORRECTLY?

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.055
THOSE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.157
PROJECT FAILURES.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.425
AND I THINK EVEN MORE

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:20.927
IMPORTANTLY ENGAGE THE END USER

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.061
SO THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.562
THE END OF SOMETHING THAT

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.431
ACTUALLY USABLE FOR FOR THE

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.499
PEOPLE THAT THE NEED TO USE THE

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:27.500
SYSTEM.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.267
THE STATE'S CURRENT PROJECT

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.936
MANAGERS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:32.705
THAT EXPERTISE AND IN MANAGING

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.374
THIS THIS NEW WAY OF DOING.

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.243
PARTICULAR AN AGILE DEVELOPMENT.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.744
AND THEN THE PROPOSAL ALSO

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.646
INCLUDES AN INNOVATION.

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.914
SO IT'S A ONE TIME FUNDING A

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.049
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ALLOW

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.250
THE OFFENSE TO ASSIST

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.686
DEPARTMENTS BUT WILSON RESOURCES

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.554
NECESSARY TO ADDRESS.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.423
THAT NEED.

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:51.557
TO INTENDED TO ALLOW THE OFFICE

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:52.425
TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ADDRESS

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.326
ISSUES AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.094
REAL TIME.

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.195
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.130
CHANGE FROM EXISTING BUDGET AND

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.865
I. T. PROJECT WE WILL PROCESS

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.101
SEES WHICH HAD YEARS TO TIME

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.436
LINES LEAVE THE LARGE PROJECT

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.171
PROPOSALS AND FORCED BY ONLY

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:08.007
RISKY AND A LARGE SCALE SYSTEM

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.875
APPLICATION.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:10.643
I KNOW IT'S THE IT'S IT'S GONNA

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.177
BE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:12.812
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.381
AND HOW THAT ON BEING YOU SINCE

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.682
THAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.216
FOR THAT THE TRAILER BILL

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.051
LANGUAGE -- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.453
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME SOME

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.388
DISCUSSION ABOUT OVERLAP BETWEEN

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.724
EXISTING OFFICES AND WHAT THIS

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.659
OFFICE WOULD USE OF BRENT SPENCE.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:29.228
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES --

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.863
THAT THAT HAS NOW BEEN OFF BEST.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.898
THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAS A

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.934
IN AN ODI AS WELL WE'RE GONNA

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.202
REMAIN NOT SO THAT WE CAN GET

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:37.069
RID OF THE FUSION THERE.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.971
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.139
THAT THESE ARE COMPLEMENTARY

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.441
ROLES THIS IS NOT.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.543
SAME THINGS IN FACT CD TEASE

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.278
FOCUS MORE ON ON THE THE

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:47.580
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STAFF.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.815
THIS IS FOCUSED MORE ON THE

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:52.184
EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP.

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.486
THE MANAGEMENT STAFF WROTE THE

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:54.754
PROGRAM STAFF.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.455
THIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT IT ON

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.190
THIS SIDE.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.393
AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.595
GOING TO BE COMPLIMENTARY

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.163
COMPLEMENTARY ROLES RATHER THAN.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.998
INNER OVERLAP.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.933
SO -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.903
CONSIDERATION PUZZLE AND I'M

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.672
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

[inaudible]

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.479
OKAY -- YOU WANT.

PARTICULAR GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL --

LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION ALL TO

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.225
SUMMARIZE THEM THE THREE MAIN

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.193
AREAS.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.895
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.463
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE RELATIVE TO

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.398
THIS NEW OFFICE I'M PARTICULARLY

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.767
IN THE CRITERIA USED TO SELECT

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:42.902
THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA BE

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.804
FUNDED WITH THE INNOVATION FUND

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.505
MONIES -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:47.807
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SOME OF

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.075
THOSE CRITERIA WILL INCLUDE

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.609
THINGS SUCH AS THE POLICY

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:52.378
INTERESTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION --

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:53.813
FEEDBACK FROM MANAGERS AND

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.047

INNOVATION ACADEMY AS WELL AS A

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:57.983
DEPARTMENTS READING THIS

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.152
ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE NEW OFFICE

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.620
IN THESE PROPOSALS AND SO.

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.722
THERE'S NOT A CLEAR ROLE FOR THE

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.024
LEGISLATURE IN DEFINING WHAT --

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.159
ITS INTERESTS ARE IN SELECTING

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.361
THE DEPARTMENTS -- THERE'S ALSO

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:13.165
THE ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT -- AS

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.135
THAT -- AS WAS MENTIONED --

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:18.571
RELATED TO THE CURRENT -- BUDGET

APPROPRIATION THAT'S CURRENTLY

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:24.610
THROUGH THEIR BUDGET BILLING

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:25.778
WHICH ON SUBJECT ANY STRINGS

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.380
ATTACHED -- AT THIS TIME ON THE

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:29.682
SECOND ISSUE IS AROUND THIS

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:31.650
ISSUE OF DEFINING CD T. ARMOR

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.752
TECHNOLOGY RELATIVE TO THE NEW

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.488
OFFICE -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:36.422
THAT THE RULES MAY BE

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.790
COMPLEMENTARY TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:40.860
pFUNDING AND POSITIONS IT'S OUR

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:41.360
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.028
ADMINISTRATION -- INTENDS TO

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:43.996
ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.698
TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN THE

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:46.298
FUNDING IN POSITIONS THAT IT

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.334
DOES HAVE -- RATHER THAN

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.435
REVERTING THE SAVINGS BACK TO

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.770
THE STATE SO IT IS IMPORTANT WE

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:53.339
BELIEVE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:54.273
CONSIDER WHETHER THAT'S

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.342
APPROPRIATE -- DECISION TO BE

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:57.977
MADE AND THE LAST.

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.411
PIECE OF THIS IS WHETHER THE

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:00.713
ACTUAL PROPOSED AND LEVEL OF

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.915
FUNDING IN POSITIONS -- IS IS

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.583
REALISTIC OR OR COULD BE

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.818
ACHIEVED GIVEN THAT WE HAD

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:12.158
DIFFICULTY IN THE PAST HIRING IT --

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:12.925
WE APPRECIATE THAT NOT ALL THE

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:14.093
STAFF WILL BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.860
IN I. T. -- BUT THERE MAY BE

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:15.828

PARTICULARLY WANTS TO HAVE

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.383
LOOKED AT I DON'T THINK THAT WE

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.552
WOULD BE OPPOSED TO TO LOOK INTO --

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.753
CURRENTLY AT THAT THE HHS

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.356
ANIMATION OFFICE THE IDEAS.

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.857
THE PROJECTS COME FROM THE

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.426
DEPARTMENTS THEMSELVES.

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:22.828
AND SO -- THERE MAY BE INSTANCES

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.430
WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:25.898
TO SAY THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.032
IN THE OFFICE IS GOING TO LOOK

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:27.900
INTO IT.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.768
BUT IN A LOT OF CASES I WOULD

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.003
WANT THOSE COMING OUT FROM THE

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.038
DEPARTMENT'S INSTEAD SAID

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:33.539

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:34.573
DEPARTMENT.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.407
IS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.743
TYPE OF PROJECT THAT YOU HAVE.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.911
A PAIRING OF THE DEPARTMENTAL

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.746
STAFF WHO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.781
THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE HAVING.

ALONG WITH THE EXPERT IN THE IN

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.618
THE NEW APPROACHES.

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.419
AND THEN IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:49.188
THE LONGER TERM THAT THE

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.055
DEPARTMENT BUYS INTO IT SO THAT

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:51.824
THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.259
IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION.

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.527
RATHER THAN SOMEBODY COME AND

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:56.562
TELL YOU THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.464
DO WALK AWAY AND THEN YOU SAY

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.765
WELL WE'RE DONE WITH THAT WE'RE

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.100
GOING BACK TO THE WAY THAT.

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.801
WE'VE DONE IT ASI SAID THIS IS

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:04.303
REALLY ABOUT CULTURAL CHANGE.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.771
SO THE PROJECT REALLY

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.840
INCREMENTALLY THE LEAD TO EIGHT

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:09.575
SHIFT IN THE THE CULTURE OF THE

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.609
DEPARTMENTS.

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:11.677
THE ONE THAT'S FOCUSED ON

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.646
INNOVATION FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:15.514
WAYS OF APPROACHING PROBLEMS AND

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:19.485
MOST IMPORTANTLY FOCUSED ON

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.854
THEIR END USERS -- AS FAR AS THE

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.355
SAVINGS I I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.657
THERE ARE SAVINGS AT THE MOMENT

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:25.858
I I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.293
OVERLAP BETWEEN.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.794
THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.530
THE PROPOSED OFFICE SO WE WE

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.366
DON'T SEE THAT THERE ARE SAVINGS

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.301
THERE COULD BE SOME.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.269
COULD BE SCORED -- WERE OPEN TO

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:39.104
THAT CONVERSATION OF PEOPLE SEE

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:40.306
MORE OVERLAP AND I'M SAYING I

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.573
I'M OPEN OF THE CONVERSATION

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.876
ABOUT WHAT THAT OVERLAP LOOKS

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:45.177
LIKE.

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:47.313
AND AS FAR AS HIRING HIRING IS

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.081
DIFFICULT AND AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.282
HIRE GOOD PEOPLE INTO THESE

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.950
POSITIONS.

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.420
THEY'RE NOT REALLY -- GONNA BE

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:55.921
THERE MAY BE SOME MIGHTY PEOPLE

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.656
BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT GOING

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:58.957
TO BE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:00.959
POSITIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:04.396
STUFF THAT WE'RE DOING -- AT HHS

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.964
SOMEWHAT INVISION.

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:07.733
THEM DURING THE OFF THE DIGITAL

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.901
INNOVATION IS REALLY AROUND

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.302
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT.

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.770
AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.440
APPROACHING APPROACHING PROBLEMS

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.541
SOME OF IT MAY HAVE AN IT

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.643
COMPONENT TO IT BUT IT'S NOT

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.680
GOING TO BE AN I. T. DRIP AND

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.816
PROCESS [inaudible]

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:28.854
OKAY -- THANK YOU SECTOR WILL

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.590
MEAN. TO THE POINT YOU MADE

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.825
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SO.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.093
A YEAR FROM NOW HOW DO WE FIGURE

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:34.960
OUT WHETHER THIS BEEN IS BEEN AN

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.895
EFFECTIVE USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.330
WHAT WHAT METRICS ARE WE GONNA

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:40.165
USED TO JUDGE WHETHER THIS IS

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.201
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT [inaudible]

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.902
SO.

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.204
A YEAR FROM NOW AND THE FIRST

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.038
STEP IS GOING TO BE GETTING A

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:49.108
DIRECTOR FOR FOR THE OFFICE AND

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.609
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A WIDE

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.878
SEARCH FOR THAT AND IT'S A

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.680
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.315
PEOPLE WHO I THINK ARE IN THAT.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:57.783
WILL THAT THEY WOULD REALLY WANT

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.017
IS THAT REALLY HIGH CALIBER

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.219
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ABLE TO

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.588
DELIVER ON THAT SO I AM LOOKING

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:03.155
FOR SOMEBODY WHO CAN HIT THE

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:04.556
GROUND RUNNING.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.091
AND THAT WILL GIVE ME AN IDEA OF

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.993
WHAT I CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.861
WITHIN A YEAR.

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:11.029
WHAT I WOULD WANT IS THAT WE WE

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.364
HAVE THE TRAINING CURRICULUM UP

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.232
AND WE'RE STARTING TO TRAIN UP

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.501
EXECUTIVES THAT WE CAN COME BACK

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.969
TO YOU AND SAY HERE'S HERE'S

00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.370
WHAT THE TRAINING PROGRAM LOOKS

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:19.104
LIKE HERE'S HOW MANY PEOPLE WE

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:19.538
TRAINED?

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.873
HERE THE THINGS WERE STARTING TO

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:23.041
SEE OUT OF THAT AND SOME OF THE

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:24.543
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CHANGING

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.310
BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THEY WERE

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:26.178
GETTING.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.446
SO I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:28.914
THAT THIS OFFICE LIVES BY WHAT

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:31.850
IT'S ALSO MOUSING WHICH IS THAT.

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.519
WE CHANGE AS WE LEARN WE

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.354
CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.389
WE CONTINUE TO GET FEEDBACK AND

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:40.192
THEN WE SHIFT AS WE NEED TO TO

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.628
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE END USER --

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:43.962
I ALSO THINK THAT.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.497
YOU KNOW ITIS QUITE POSSIBLE

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.865
THAT WILL HAVE SOME PROJECTS

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.734
DONE WITHIN A YEAR -- BECAUSE WE

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.135
CAN GET SOME SMALLER PROJECTS

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.470
AND PROBABLY BRING THOSE UP WE

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.005
CAN SCALE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.473
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ITS C. HHS

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.875
AND START TO SCALE -- OUT TO THE

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.577
THE BROADER STATE AGENCIES AND

00:17:58.644 --> 00:17:59.378
DEPARTMENTS.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.546
AND SO I THINK WE'LL WE'LL BE

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:01.380
ABLE TO COME BACK WITH SOME

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:03.048
ACTUAL SUCCESSES AND SAY HERE'S

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.583
WHAT WE'VE DONE TO IMPROVE THE

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.684
WAY THAT WERE APPROACHING

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:06.919
PROBLEMS.

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.587
HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE TO

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:09.922
IMPROVE DATA SHARING ACROSS

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.623
DEPARTMENTS HERE'S WHAT WE'VE

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.392
DONE TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.694
WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDING TO

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:16.929
INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:19.364
IT BACK IS ON WHAT THAT SERVICE

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.699
LOOKS LIKE.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.266
WE SHOULD ALSO WITHIN A YEAR

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.334
HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.735
FUTURE OF THE OFFICE REALLY IS

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:24.837
GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:26.438
SO I THINK WITHIN THAT YEAR WE

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.540
NEED TO BE FIGURING OUT WHERE WE

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.342
GOING TO FOCUS.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.977
AND START MOVING IN THAT

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.213
DIRECTION AND SO.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.681
YEAH IT IT'S NOT GONNA BE NOW

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.216
WE'RE STARTING WITHOUT STAFF AT

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.584
THE MOMENT SO I'M NOT GONNA TELL

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.952
YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:40.986
DELIVERABLE.

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.621
THAT WE PUT IN FRONT OF YOU AT

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.188
THE END OF A YOU KNOW A YEAR

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.156
FROM NOW.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.324
BUT I DO EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.625
SOME SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:47.893
PROGRESS.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.461
IN MOVING TOWARDS MOVING THE

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:52.130
CULTURE OF OF THE STATE AGENCIES

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.532
AT LEAST AND POCKETS.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.500
AND THEN I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:57.002
SCALABLE OUT OVER THE COMING

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:57.803
YEARS.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.639
THE CONCERN IS IS THAT WHEN WE

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:01.406
CREATE A NEW GOVERNMENT

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:01.707
[inaudible]

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.876
ORGANIZATION WITHOUT A DEFINED

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.143
SORT OF PRODUCT.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.912
IN STATE.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.414
THAT THAT ORGANIZATION EXISTS.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.649
JUST TO EXIST THE YEARS THAT

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.384
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT THAT IT'S

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.919
JUST SELF PERPETUATING.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.904
WHAT IT WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:13.805
REALLY?

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:16.108

AT LEAST WITHIN YOUR PREVIOUS

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:29.354
DEPARTMENT.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:30.922
RIGHT AND MAYBE A FEW OTHER

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.992
EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING OR

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.127
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.529
AND THERE. TO THIS POINT

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:38.830
SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES OF WHAT CAN

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:41.166
BE DONE.

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:42.834
SO WHY IS A NEW.

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.836
WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT WITH FIFTY

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:47.406
MORE PEOPLE AND THIS MONEY WHY

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.341
IS THAT NEEDED IF.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.076
THROUGH YOUR OWN PERSONAL

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.211
EXPERIENCE HERE.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:56.014
YOU SEE YOU'VE SEEN WHAT CAN BE

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.215
DONE IN THE DEPARTMENTS.

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.950
IT IS NOT AS YOU SAID IS SO

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:01.153
IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNLESS THERE

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:03.689
IS BY AND BY PEOPLE ON THE

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.057
GROUND TO HAVE THE PRACTICAL

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:06.858
EXPERIENCE OF WHAT'S WORKING AND

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.260
WHAT'S NOT WHAT.

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.128
WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT IS AN WOULD

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.763
STILL BE LEFT OUT.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.597
SO.

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:15.534
I STILL DON'T GET WHERE.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.469
SOMETHING IS GONNA NEED LEAD TO

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:19.237
THE ON SOMETHING BETTER.

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.473
THAT WE NEED A GOVERNMENT RIGHT

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.844
AND AND THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION --

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:26.545
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.379
THE POINTS IS THAT TO REALLY DO

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.680
THIS STATEWIDE YOU NEED A

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.749
CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT'S ABLE

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:31.149
TO DO IT.

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.752
AND AND APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.554
SO WHAT WE WE DID IT HEALTH AND

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.255
HUMAN SERVICES AS WE'VE KIND OF

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.924
COBBLED IT TOGETHER AND IT'S

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.258
DOING SINCE SOME INTERESTING

00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:42.728
WORK AND AND SOME IMPACTFUL WORK

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.463
FOR INSTANCE WE WE LOOKED AT

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.098
WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.733
PROGRAM AND CAL BRASH.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.735
AND LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:53.905
OVERLAP WAS -- IN THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.474
AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL SO

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.608
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH

00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:58.677
COUNTIES ARE DOING A GOOD JOB

00:22:58.744 --> 00:22:59.211
ENROLLING PEOPLE IN THOSE

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:00.045
PROGRAMS.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:01.346
WHICH ONES ARE HAVING SOME

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:03.548
STRUGGLES WATER BEST PRACTICES

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:05.584
TO HELP THEM BUT ALSO TO GIVE

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.284
THAT INFORMATION BACK TO

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:07.586
COUNTIES AT THE CENSUS TRACK

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:08.420
LEVEL.

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.554
SO THAT THEY CAN THEN DO

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:12.190
TARGETED AND OUTRAGE RATHER THAN

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:13.925
A GENERAL APPROACH TO THEIR CAL

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.861
FRESH PROGRAM.

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:18.196
THEY CAN INSTEAD TARGET.

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:18.864
PARTICULAR AREA AND SAY THIS IS

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.998
MARIE AND GET THE BEST BANG FOR

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.701
THE BUCK -- WERE ALSO STARTING

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.070
TO LOOK AT THE THE PROCESS THAT

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:26.772
WE USE TO BRING INCOMPETENT TO

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:29.207
STAND TRIAL INDIVIDUALS INTO THE

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:30.242
STATE HOSPITAL.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.710
THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT WAIT

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.512
LIST FOR YEARS ON IT IT'S

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.347
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN SUED

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.748
ON MANY TIMES.

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.650
AND THAT WE BUT A LOT OF

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:40.285
RESEARCH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.020
THE ADMINISTRATION PUT A LOT OF

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.122
RESOURCES AND TO INCREASE IN THE

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:45.557
NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:47.259
AVAILABLE IN THE STATE HOSPITALS

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:48.894
AND OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.662
BUT NOW WORD THROUGH THAT OFFICE

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:53.198
LOOKING AT THE PROCESS ITSELF.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.033
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT MOVING THAT

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.935
THROUGH DAY THE COUNTIES AND

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:58.003
THROUGH THE STATE AND ARE THERE

00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:59.738
WAYS TO TRUNCATE?

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:02.107
THAT PROCESS TO GET THE WAIT

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.041
TIME DOWN [inaudible]

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:03.708
SO.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.876
THERE'S THERE'S A LIMIT TO WHAT

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.511
YOU CAN DO WITH THE RE DIRECTED

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.480
RESOURCES AND IT'S ALL INTERNAL

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.881
STAFF AT THE MOMENT.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.516
SO ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT I

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.485
SEE WITH THIS OFFICE IS THAT

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.953
IT'S A PARTNERING WITH WITH

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.956
EXTERNAL WITH PRIVATE SECTOR --

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.724
THE US DIGITAL SERVICES BRINGS

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:20.992
AND PEOPLE FROM THE PRIVATE

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.094
SECTOR ON TO OUR FOUR YEAR

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:25.697
STANDS -- THAN A MAN.

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:26.932
THEY THEY DO GOVERNMENT SERVICE

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:28.633
THEY BRING IN SOME IDEAS ABOUT

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.102
HOW TO IMPROVE HOW IT OPERATES

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.038
WORK ON PARTICULAR PROJECTS THAN

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:33.972
THEY GO BACK TO THE PRIVATE

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:34.873
SECTOR.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.208
I THINK LIKEWISE THIS OFFICE

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:38.143
NEEDS TO HAVE THAT THAT ABILITY

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.444
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT FUNDING

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:40.912
ALLOWS YOU TO DO.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:42.848
WHICH WERE NOT ABLE TO DO IT

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:44.349
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES --

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.919
IT'S ALSO A MUCH BROADER REACH

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.087
SO.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:49.621
YOU KNOW HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.256
SERVICES IS THE LARGEST AGENCY

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.691
IN THE STATE THERE'S THERE'S

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:54.392
RESOURCES AVAILABLE THAT I WAS

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:57.429
ABLE TO TO RE DIRECT. FOR AS

00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:01.299
SMALL OFFICE -- BUT THAT'S

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.667
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE AND ALL

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:04.269
AGENCIES ARE ALL DEPARTMENTS

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.071
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THIS

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:07.839
OFFICE ALLOWS FOR THE ONES THAT

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:10.175
CAN'T DO THAT SORT OF THING TO

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:11.810
ACTUALLY HAVE.

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:13.445
NOW THE ABILITY TO TO DO THIS

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.846
TYPE OF WORK.

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:15.647
HAVING IT AT GOVERNOR

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:17.816
GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS ALLOWS

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:18.650
IT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE IT

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:19.451
CENTRAL.

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.887
WHERE IT ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:24.589
TO PUSH THIS?

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.058
SO FRIENDS AT HHS.

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.560
I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.829
I WAS SECRETARY OF THE AGENCY

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.597
AND I HAD PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.532
AND THERE WAS BY AND OVER ABOUT

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.268
A FOUR YEAR PERIOD.

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.769
AND HOW THIS WORK.

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.304
I THINK THIS HAS TO BE SCALED UP

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.672
FASTER THAN THAT.

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:42.440
THAT WAS A A PROCESS THAT WE

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:43.808
WENT THROUGH THAT WAS REALLY A

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:47.078
PROTOTYPING PROCESS OF HOW.

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.146
TO LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS IN

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.748
THE FOUR YEARS AND WILL APPLY

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.483
THOSE AS WE START TO BRING THIS

AT IT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT YOU MEAN

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:04.162
BY TO DO THIS -- AND THAT'S WHY

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.630
WE NEED A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:07.465
LIKE RIGHT AND THAT AND THAT'S

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:09.467
WHY WITH STIRRED MIGHT QUESTION

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:10.435

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:13.238
THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES -- AND

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.839
IS THIS AN ATTEMPT TO COME IN

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.141
AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:17.409
ACROSS THE BOARD IN EVERY SINGLE

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.310
DEPARTMENT.

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:19.644
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.212
TO DO AND I THINK TO SENATOR

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.647
UMBERG'S QUESTION IS.

00:26:22.714 --> 00:26:24.482
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN ALL

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:26.952
THE DEPARTMENTS ARE YOU GOING TO

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:28.053
BE IN A POSITION TO SAY

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:28.353
[inaudible]

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.387
YES.

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:30.755
THIS IS THE DECISION OF WHAT

00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:32.824
WE'RE GOING TO DO I I DON'T KNOW

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.359
WHAT THE THIS IS.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:36.428
THAT'S EXPECTED AND ARE YOU

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:39.230
GOING TO MANDATE SOMETHING.

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.466
THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS AGENCIES

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.501
AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS IT'S

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.270
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT YOU'RE GONNA

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:46.771
MANDATE TO THEIR SO THERE ARE A

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.073
COUPLE THINGS WERE WE'RE GOING

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.474
TO MANDATE THE TRAINING SO THAT

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.343
WE HAVE PEOPLE AT THE THE SENIOR

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:53.244
LEVELS THAT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS.

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.446
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE.

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:55.947
SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE THE

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.048
APPROACHES.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.050
SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:01.019
WHAT'S POSSIBLE SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.587
THE FIRST MANDATE THAT WE'RE

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.722
GOING TO HAVE.

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.657
I THINK THE ONE COMMONALITY THAT

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.325
WILL BE THERE THROUGH ALL OF THE

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:08.460
PROJECTS.

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:11.262
IS A FOCUS ON THE END USER

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.598
WHETHER THAT STATE STAFF IN SOME

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.533
INSTANCES WHETHER IT MY ANSWER

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.102
RECEIVING SERVICES.

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:19.070
WHETHER IT'S THE GENERAL PUBLIC --

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.906
THE TRYING TO REGISTER CARS OR

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:23.675
WHATEVER THEY'RE TRYING TO DO --

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.410
THERE'S GOING TO BE A FOCUS ON

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.779
THE END USER WHICH ISN'T THERE

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:29.547
AND IN MOST AREAS OF STATE

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:30.482
GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW AND

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:31.883
HONESTLY IN MOST AREAS OF

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.653
GOVERNMENT -- THE ACTUAL

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.155
PROJECTS THEMSELVES.

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.823
IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.026
THE NEEDS ARE SO IT COULD BE

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:43.061
SOMETHING LIKE TAKING DATA FROM.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.596
BROWN'S MATCHING IT UP FIGURE

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:48.066
OUT OVERLAPS AND HOW DO YOU PUSH.

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.235
THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROGRAMS --

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:51.903
AND THAT'S GONNA THAT -- WICK

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.606
CAL FRESH EXAMPLE IT CAN BE

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.608
PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS SO YOU KNOW

00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.643
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.146
AT AN APPROVAL PROCESS.

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:03.681
OR AT A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:05.417
THAT CAN GO ACROSS MULTIPLE

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.218
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THAT CAN GO

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:09.020
ACROSS THE COUNTY AND STATE.

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.655
GET IN THERE AND ACTUALLY START

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.023
TO TO TEAR IT APART AND WHAT'S

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.559
WHAT'S NEEDED SO FOR INSTANCE WE

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:15.360
PARTNERED UP WITH RESEARCH

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:16.828
UNIVERSITIES TO STREAMLINE

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.263
ACCESS TO DATA.

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.799
SO BEFORE WE DID THIS THERE WERE

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:23.501
MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS FOR HHS.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:25.170
INSTEAD NOW THERE'S A COMMON

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.805
APPLICATION WE WENT THROUGH AND

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:28.473
SAID WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.674
BE ASKING.

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.509
FOR AND IF IF WE HAVE THINGS

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:33.678
THAT AREN'T STATUTORILY REQUIRED

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:34.979
WHY ARE WE DOING THAT. TO JUST

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.181
PULL IT OUT WHAT ARE THE

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:38.850
COMMONALITIES SO THAT YOU DON'T

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.385
HAVE TO GO ACROSS.

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.153
MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS ANYHOW ONE

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.088
ACCESS POINT.

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:45.390
SO THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.992
WEBSITE REDESIGNS -- YEAH THE

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.427
WEBSITES OF THE MOST STATE

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.062
DEPARTMENTS ARE FAIRLY DIFFICULT

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:54.065
TO NAVIGATE -- QUITE OFTEN YOU

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:55.800
DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.135
ASA MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC YOU

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.703
REALLY WANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:59.571
WEBSITE.

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:00.972
INSTEAD YOU YOU HAVE

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.474
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.276
YOU HAVE BIO'S OF THE DIRECTOR.

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.444
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT YOU KNOW

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.146
IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:09.581
A PRIVATE CITIZEN VIEWPOINT YOU

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.549
REALLY DON'T CARE.

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:13.017
YOU REALLY JUST YOU WANT.

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.819
ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR SERVICE

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.621
YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE AND

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:17.489
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.791
THAT THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.159
AND START TO SHIFT.

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:24.629
HOW WE WE INTERACT WITH THE

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.698
GENERAL PUBLIC?

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.299
JUST ONE MORE QUESTION -- YOU

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.000
MENTIONED THIS BUT YOU CAN.

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:30.902
GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:32.337
THIS COMPLEMENTARY WITH

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:35.173
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I MEAN

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.343
WE ALREADY HAVE.

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:40.211
THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT.

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:40.845
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.781
AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:46.518
DIFFERENT -- THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.853
TECHNOLOGY IS IS REALLY FOCUSED

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.622
ON TECHNOLOGY THIS THIS IS NOT

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:53.124
NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:53.992
TECHNOLOGY I GUESS A LOT OF IT

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:56.261
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT A LOT OF ITS

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.662
FOCUSING ON END USERS.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:58.863
AND CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.566
VIEW OUR SOLUTIONS.

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:02.700
NOW THE SOLUTION MAY HAVE SOME

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:06.471
IT COMPONENT TO IT BUT IT'S NOT

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:07.772
ABOUT THE THE I. T. -- THE

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.240
TRAINING IS FOCUSED ON

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:12.076
EXECUTIVES AND ON PROGRAM STAFF

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.711
NOT ON THE IT.

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:14.812
COMMUNITY.

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.281
THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:18.082
FOCUSES ON THE I. T. COMMUNITY

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:20.818
SO THEY PROVIDE TRAINING FOR FOR

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.387
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOLKS.

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.422
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMON

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.925
PLATFORM SO -- FOR INSTANCE WHEN

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.293
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.461
THE MACRO -- WEB PAGE FOR THE

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:32.764
STATE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.733
OUT -- SOMETHING LIKE A MACRO

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.834
PAYMENT.

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.369
STANDARD FOR THE STATE.

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.004
THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY AN I.

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.439
T. PROJECT.

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.373
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.509
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY DOES

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.711
NOW WILL CONTINUE TO DO --

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.746
OVERSIGHT OF LARGE IT PROJECTS

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.081
IS IN THE PURVIEW OF THE

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.849
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THIS

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.084
OFFICE WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:59.724
IN LARGE IT PROCUREMENTS. SEVEN

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:01.793
WHEN IT WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:04.596
YEAH -- QUESTION -- AND THESE

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.397
THE GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF

00:31:06.464 --> 00:31:08.566
THE FIFTY POSITIONS -- ONE

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.401
QUESTION WAS HOW WE HOW DO YOU

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:13.037
EXPECT HIGHER THAT MANY BUT HOW

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.472
DID YOU COME UP WITH. FIFTY

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:17.508
POSITIONS THAT THAT WOULD BE.

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:20.945
THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF STAFF.

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.113
IT WAS JUST THE INITIAL ESTIMATE

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.047
YOU KNOW IT WE WENT THROUGH AND

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.182
LOOKED AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.050
STAFF THAT WE WOULD NEED TO RUN

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:27.418
AN OFFICE LIKE THIS.

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:28.753
AND THEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.588
THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:31.356
FUNCTIONAL STAFF THAT WE WOULD

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:33.124
NEED BUILT IN THE DIFFERENT

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.025
AREAS.

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:36.294
AND WE WOULD NEED MULTIPLE

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:38.129
PROJECTS GOING AT THE SAME TIME

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:41.499
SO THAT'S NO IT'S NOT.

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:42.467
IF YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF YOU DO

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.235
FOR YOUR PROJECTS IF YOU HAVE

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:46.104
MORE STAFF YOU DO MORE PROJECT.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.373
AND IF.

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:49.974
WHAT WE SEEN WITH THESE OFFICES

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.175
IN OTHER AREAS IS THAT THEY

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.710
SCALE OUT?

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.345
SO THEY START OUT AT A CERTAIN

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:56.914
LEVEL AND THEY THEY GENERALLY

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.483
GROW PRETTY QUICKLY AS MORE

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.251
DEPARTMENTS.

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:01.753
WANT TO HAVE THE THE SERVICES

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:03.354
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THE

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.589
INSIGHTS OF THEIR PROVIDING.

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.191
AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.559
EITHER IF IT'S A STATE THE

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.962
LEGISLATURE OR THE US CONGRESS.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.730
AS THEY HAVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:14.065
ABOUT WHAT THOSE INTERACTION

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:15.800
SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:18.202
VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS THINK

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.736
SHOULD BE DONE [inaudible]

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:21.906
PUBLIC.

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.108
THE NUMBER SO NOT NOT TO BELABOR

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:26.010
THIS BUT I SHARE SOME OF YOUR

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:29.814
CONCERNS -- SENATOR ALSO.

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.149
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.918
OFFICE NEED BE IN EXISTENCE?

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.887
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE THE END

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.188
DATE FOR THE THE OFFICE SAYS

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:40.391
WHAT I DO SEE IS THAT AS A AS

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.093
THE TRAINING CONTINUES.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.195
THAT THE THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.931
EXECUTIVES AND MORE SUPERVISORS

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.766
THAT UNDERSTAND THE APPROACHES --

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.234
AS A FEW MORE PROJECTS IN

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:51.636
PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENTS

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:52.770
THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.572
THAT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THESE

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.473
TYPES OF THINGS.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.310
AND SO I THINK THAT THE THE TYPE

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:00.978
OF WORK THAT THE OFFICE IS DOING

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.280
IS GOING TO SHIFT.

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.916
AS AS YOU DO THAT SO SOME OF THE

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:07.085
EASIER STUFF THAT ILL ENGAGE IN

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:07.919
AT THE BEGINNING.

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.253
WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.822
DEPARTMENTS AS THEY GET THE

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:12.390
SKILL SETS TO TO DO THAT ON

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.092
THEIR OWN AND THEN THE MORE

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:15.526
DIFFICULT PROJECTS ARE GOING TO

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.662
CONTINUE TO COME INTO THE OFFICE.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.130
SO I'M NOT SEEING A PARTICULAR

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.165
AND DAVE BUT I AM SAYING THAT

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.867
THE THE MISSION.

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.068
ALL THE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:25.269
MISSIONAL SAYS SOME OF THE TYPES

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:26.304
OF PROJECTS.

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:29.540
WILL CHANGE OVER TIME SO.

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:30.408
INSTRUCTOR WILL MEAN YOU YOU

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.577
HAVE A VISION AND WE'RE TRYING

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:34.312
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT VISION

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.414
IS IT'S KINDA LIKE JELLO RIGHT

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:38.816
NOW FOR ME -- AND I WOULD

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:40.685
SUGGEST THAT.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:41.252
YOU CAN YOU AT SOME POINT IN

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.488
TIME.

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.390
YOU DO IN THE NEXT YEAR HAVE A

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.392
GOAL TO WORK YOURSELF OUT OF

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.594
EXISTENCE I'M IN THE OFFICE OF

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.095
DIGITAL INNOVATION.

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.297
WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THAT TO

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.198
THE EXTENT YOU WANT TO CREATE A

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:56.167
CULTURAL CHANGE AT SOME POINT

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.068
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE THE

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.003
CULTURAL CHANGES LIKE THE OFFICE

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.005
OF GOOD GOVERNMENT IT SHOULD BE

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.974
I WOULD THINK THAT EVERY ENTITY

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.809
EVERY AGENCY WOULD WANT.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.311
TO ENGAGE IN DIGITAL INNOVATION

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.479
AND THAT.

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.814
THAT WOULD.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:12.183
MEAN THAT AT SOME POINT.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.419
EVERYBODY'S DOING IT AND SO YOU

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:16.287
THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT NEED TO

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.488
EXIST IS THAT.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.724
AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT.

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.225
I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.727
AND AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.061
THAT EXPECTATIONS ALSO CHANGE

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.596
OVER TIME.

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:28.466
AND SO TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.902
WE THOUGHT WAS GOOD TODAY MAY

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.837
NOT BE OKAY.

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.139
IN A DECADE -- SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.407
REALLY I I UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.442
YOU'RE SAYING ESPECIALLY THE

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:39.410
TRAIN UP THE WORK FORCE AS YOU

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.311
GET MORE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:40.778
THAT.

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.313
THE THAT'S WHY I SAY THE THE

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.549
PROJECT TYPES I THINK SHIFT.

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.017
AND THAT THE MORE COMPLEX THINGS

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:47.585
CONTINUE TO TO COME TO THIS

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:49.954
OFFICE AND THE EASIER THINGS.

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.255
ARE JUST TAKING CARE OF BY THE

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.957
THE PEOPLE THAT NOW BOUGHT INTO

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:53.891
THE APPROACH IS WHAT WILL BE

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.293
ANXIOUS TO SEE.

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:57.328
WHAT WHAT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.564
WHAT METRICS ARE PROVIDED?

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.400
ALL ALL ALL THOSE THINGS -- ONE

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:05.269
LAST SUGGESTION IS THAT TO YOUR

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.904
POINT ABOUT.

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.206
BEING USER CENTRIC.

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.307
AND I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.242
OTHERS IS THAT THAT WHOEVER IS

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.877
IN CHARGE OF THAT PARTICULAR

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.079
ASPECT THAT THEY ACTUALLY USE

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:15.713
THE SYSTEM.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.914
SO.

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.216
IF IT'S DMV THAT SOMEBODY

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.784
ACTUALLY TRIES TO MAKE AN

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.652
APPOINTMENT WITH DMV.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:24.222
I'VE TRIED TO DO THAT VERY HARD --

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.057
LOT OF ARE INTO YOUR POINT LOT

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.659
OF OUR POINTS OF ACCESS FOR

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.895
CONSUMERS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:31.529
NAVIGATE THE ONE EXCEPTION THAT

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:32.597
IS.

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.765
PAYING YOUR TAXES YOU CAN DO

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:36.067
THAT RELATIVELY EASILY.

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:38.202
BUT IF YOU WANT TO FOR EXAMPLE

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.804
MAKE APPOINTMENT DMV KIND OF SO

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:41.272
JUST JUST A SUGGESTION BECAUSE

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:43.040
NEXT YEAR WILL ASK OR BY THE WAY

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:44.375
DID YOU.

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:47.411
ACTUALLY USE WHATEVER.

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:48.913
AND SYSTEM YOU'VE CREATED A GOOD

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.081
SUGGESTION.

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:51.582
NO I AND I WOULD JUST BE PETE

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.284
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I STILL

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:54.252
NEED.

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:57.321
IS THE THE COLLABORATION OR THE

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:58.789
YOU MENTIONED THIS IS AS OPEN

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.825
THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE BUT

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.293
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE A LOT

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.795
CLEARER -- TO GIVE US THE THE

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:09.300
COMFORT LEVEL -- I THINK STILL

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.401
THE QUESTION OF YOUR

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:12.303
COORDINATION OR RELATIONSHIP

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.905
WITH THE IT.

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:16.207
DEPARTMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:20.211
AND HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:22.780
PRODUCE SOMETHING BETTER FOR A

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:25.616
FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:26.417
TWO YEARS.

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.553
WE NEED MORE OF THAT BUT I

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:31.022
GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:32.557
WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE GOING TO TRY

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.258
TO LOOK OUT OF THE BOX HERE THAT

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:37.061
WE'RE NOT STUCK IN ONE PLACE.

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:38.663
I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF IF

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.598
THAT'S THE CASE AND MAYBE WE

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.233
DON'T NEED.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.568
PEOPLE IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WHO

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.469
COULD MOVE INTO THIS DEPARTMENT

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.438
OR YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.606
THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION OF

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:51.342
EFFICIENCY RATHER THAN JUST.

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:52.877
HIS FIFTY MORE PEOPLE AND LET'S

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.479
GO OUT AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN SO.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.782
I GREATLY APPRECIATE -- THE

00:36:57.848 --> 00:37:00.184
IDEAS THAT YOU PRESENTED AND

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.819
WHAT YOU WANT TO COMPETITION.

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:05.556
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU --

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:08.859
PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE ON THIS.

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.294
GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.096
SENATOR ROBB GROWS CLOSER WITH

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.032
AMAZON WEB SERVICES -- SECRETARY

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.234
WILKENING USE THE TERM AND USER

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.936
AND FOR OUR CULTURE THAT MEANS

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:21.072
THE CUSTOMER AMAZON IS ONE OF

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:21.973
THE WORLD'S MOST CUSTOMER

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.441
FOCUSED CUSTOMER OBSESSED

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:24.942
COMPANIES IT AROUND.

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.677
AND WE VIEW THIS PROPOSAL

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.012
THROUGH THAT LANDS THAT THIS IS

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.180
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.982
MINISTRATIONS INCREASING THAT

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.650
COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMERS.

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:33.951
I THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.387
A GAP WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMERS

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.922
INTERACTING WITH GOVERNMENT.

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.690
AND TO HAVE AN OFFICE LIKE THIS

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.892
THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND THAT

00:37:41.959 --> 00:37:43.194
ADDITIONAL LAYER TO ASSIST WITH

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.595
THAT WOULD GREATLY GO FORWARD IN

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.063
PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO OUR

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.832
CITIZENS AND SO IT'S WITH THAT

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:48.332
LENS THAT WE SUPPORT.

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.067
THIS ITEM AND ALSO GIVEN

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.937
SECRETARY LOOKING AND IS THE

00:37:53.004 --> 00:38:00.978
POST THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.847
RENTER CENTER MY NAME'S PETER

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:03.381
KELLY I'M.

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.582
PRIVATE CITIZEN BUT I USED TO

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:06.183
WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.451
IN THIS SPACE.

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:08.085
AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:13.424
COMMENTS.

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:14.859
GOVERNMENT HAS TWO MODELS FOR

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.193
HOW IT CHANGES.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.795
THE FIRST IS TELLING PEOPLE HOW

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:18.896
TO DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.665
AND THE SECOND IS SHOWING HOW TO

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:21.232
DO IT FROM THE INSIDE IT'S

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:22.333
PARTNER.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.100
WE HAVE FAR TOO MUCH OF THE

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:24.301
FIRST.

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.870
AND NOT ENOUGH OF A SECOND.

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:27.805
THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO BE

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.807
FOCUSING ON THE SECOND.

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.676
IT LOOKS AT MODELS THE U. K.

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:32.476
GOVERNMENT FULL SERVICE AND THE

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:34.612
USPS WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.847
ADOPTED THIS APPROACH.

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:37.415
OVER THE LAST FOUR TO SEVEN

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.983
YEARS.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.484
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MODELS

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.653
WHERE IT IS DEFINING HOW DO

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.754
SOMETHING.

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.022
IT IS A MODEL THAT'S COMING FROM

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.157
THE INSIDE AND CHUCKLE HOW DO AS

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.458
A PARTNER.

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.560
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT.

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:51.162
THIS AGENCY HAS PROVEN LAST

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:53.030
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT IT HAS MADE

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.365
THIS MODEL.

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.600
AFFECTED WITHIN SIEGES OF ESSAY

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.335
AND IT SHOULD BE LOOKED OUT

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:00.204
ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT.

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:02.239
TOP COVER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:02.907
THESE SORTS OF CHANGE THE

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.575
SOMETHING SECRETARY HAS DONE

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.077
SOMETHING TO GO OFF HAS DONE.

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.912
BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT IS

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:10.381
SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:12.983
CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED.

WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WE COULD DO

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:06.890
IT IN A VERY TRADITIONAL WAY NO

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:07.958
BIG DEAL.

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.759
BUT IT'S THE HARD TO COUNT THAT

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.228
WERE REALLY.

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.263
MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON SO.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.565
THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.334
BUDGET AND MY STRATEGY.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.335
SO I ALWAYS SAY I'M FILIPINO

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:19.636
AMERICAN BUT I'M REALLY NOT HARD

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:21.371
TO COUNT SO I HOPE NOT TO SEE

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.206
ANY OF OUR STATES OUTREACH

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:25.141
EFFORTS ARE EFFORTS AND ALL OF

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:25.775
US HERE WILL OBVIOUSLY FILL IT

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:26.343
OUT.

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.744
OUR EFFORT TO REALLY FOCUS ON

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:29.746
WHAT WE LOOK AT THOSE HARD TO

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.349
HELP POPULATIONS WE ALSO LOOK AT

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:33.950
HARD TO COUNT CENSUS TRACKS OR

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:34.818
GEOGRAPHY.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:37.921
BECAUSE THE THE U. S. CENSUS IS

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.689
EIGHT ADDRESS BASED ENUMERATION

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.558
WE KIND OF CUT IT BOTH WAYS SO

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:42.759
WE HAVE HARD TO COUNT --

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.561
DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS WHICH I

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:45.962
CALL A BORDER POPULATIONS WHICH

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:48.098
INCLUDE YOU KNOW THE ASIAN

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.733
AMERICAN LATINOS AFRICAN

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.334
AMERICANS MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.537
AFRICANS NATIVE AMERICANS YOU

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:54.771
KNOW A PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.206
HOMELESSNESS.

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.041
UP PEOPLE WITH LOW BROADBAND AS

00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:00.443
A WHOLE LIST OF FIFTEEN

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.611
DIFFERENT -- WELL CALLED

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:04.114
DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS AND THEN

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.117
WE LOOK AT ACROSS THE STATE

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.319
WE'VE TAKEN THAT THE FIGHTING IS

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:10.320
WERE DOING I WHICH FOR THE THE

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:10.987
CENSUS.

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:12.222
AND WE HAD YOU SENSE OF DATA TO

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.124
ACTUALLY DO THIS EXAMINATION SO

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.792
WE LOOK AT GEOGRAPHICALLY AREAS

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.527
THAT HAVE VARIABLE SO THAT'S ALL

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.929
DATA BASED.

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:20.997
THAT WOULD WOULD ACTUALLY OVERLY

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:22.032
TO PROMOTE THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.767
LIVING IN THOSE AREAS WILL BE

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.769
HARD TO COUNT. FOR EXAMPLE IN A

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:28.471
LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEY HAVE ONE

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:29.439
OF THEIR KEY FACTORS IS CROWDED

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.274
HOUSING UNITS RIGHT BECAUSE

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:33.376
PEOPLE ARE DOUBLING UP BECAUSE

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:33.944
RENTS.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.579
AND HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE YOU

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.247
CAN HAVE THREE OR FOUR FAMILIES

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.682
LIVING IN A SINGLE UNIT THE

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.116
HOUSE WANT TO DRESS.

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:42.018
SO OVERCROWDING MEANS THAT THAT

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.754
ADDRESS WILL GET ONE POSTCARD OR

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.923
ONE FORM AND ONE PERSON THAT THE

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.758
CALL HAD A THE US CENSUS RECALLS

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:49.192
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.060
WILL FILL IT OUT BUT IF THE ONLY

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:51.695
FILL OUT FOR ONE OF THE FAMILIES

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:52.929
THEY'VE JUST LOT LOST TWO OF THE

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:53.797
OTHER FAMILIES.

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.398
LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IS

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:58.435
ANOTHER FACTOR THAT THAT WE

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.403
OVERLAY UP IN THOSE AREAS AND SO

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.540
WE LOOK AT THE DENSITY OF PEOPLE

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:04.374
HEARD CROWDED UNITS LIMITED.

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.109
ENGLISH PROFICIENCY EDUCATIONAL

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.877
FOLKS THAT ARE -- MAYBE PER

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:16.353
RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.921
LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS LIKE

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:18.989
RENTER'S SO THERE'S A NUMBER WAY

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.991
SO WE LOOK AT AND THEN THE WAY

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:21.758
WE DO OUR BUDGET IS WE LOOK AT

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:22.158
WHERE.

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.426
AT THREE WAYS WHERE THEY ARE

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.527
REGIONAL WE HAVE A REGIONALLY

00:54:24.594 --> 00:54:25.528
CBO'S A WE DEDICATED. THIRTY

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.730
PLUS ADDITIONAL TEN CENTS FORTY

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:27.364
MILLION OF THE HUNDRED FORTY TO

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.632
THAT.

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:34.104
THEN ALSO COUNTIES SO AND

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.239
DEDICATED ABOUT THIRTY MILLION --

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:39.209
FOR THEM AS WELL SO IT'S UNDER

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:39.976
SIXTY OR SO THAT WOULD BE FORTY

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:40.610
PLUS I'M DOING ALL THE MATH IN

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:41.444
MY HEAD SORRY.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.046
AND THEN WE DID A STATEWIDE

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:46.282
CBO'S WHICH IS WHO THEY ARE THIS

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:46.916
FIFTEEN DEMOGRAPHIC VULNERABLE

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.685
POPULATIONS AND THEN THE FINAL

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:50.620
KIND OF LEG OF THE STOOL IS HOW

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.454
DO WE GET TO THEM IT'S OUR

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:51.955
SECTOR.

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.491
OUTRAGE WHICH IS HOW DO YOU GET

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:56.426
TO THEM THROUGH UNIONS THROUGH

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:58.228
SCHOOLS THROUGH -- FAITH BASED

00:54:58.294 --> 00:55:00.697
ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH EMPLOYERS

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:03.066
OUT I THINK PERSONALLY THAT AT

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:03.900
THIS OF MY THIRD DECENNIAL

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:04.668
CENSUS.

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.436
OF THE YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.172
VERY KEY IN HELPING US REACH ALL

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.741
THOSE POPULATIONS -- AND FRANKLY

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.376
I'VE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD THEY'RE

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:15.078
PRETTY CHARGED UP ABOUT SHE'S

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.680
SAYING I CAN'T VOTE BUT I CAN.

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.081
AND I CAN GET EVERYBODY TO COUNT

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.916
AND SHE GOES TO PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.252
HERE IN OF SACRAMENTO.

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.788
MANY OF HER -- OF COLLEAGUES FOR

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:25.522
STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS DON'T

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:26.356
SPEAK ENGLISH AT HOME AND

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.257
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE THE

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:28.692
ONES THAT FILL OUT THOSE FORMS.

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:30.360
SO I DON'T KNOW IF I MAY DIDN'T

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:31.761
DO ALL THE NUMBERS WITH THAT BUT

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.630
I WANTED TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO.

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.131
HOW WE ARE SORT OF BLANKETING

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.100
AND DISTURBING THOSE DOLLARS ON

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.601
THE GROUND AND THEN WE HAVE THAT

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.470
AIR GAME WHICH IS THE THE ETHNIC

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.238
MEDIA -- REALLY CULTURALLY

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:47.711
APPROPRIATE MESSAGING THAT WILL

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.879
COMBINE WITH THE GROUND.

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:50.613
WELL JUST SAID JUST ADD TO THAT

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.549
IS EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IS

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:53.717
REALLY TO THAT DATA.

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:54.984
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT FUNDING AND

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.019
WHERE WE NEED TO DEDICATE

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:56.953
RESOURCES AS OF WE REALLY ARE

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.721
TARGETING WHERE THE HEART

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.222
IDENTIFIED HER ACCOUNT

00:55:59.289 --> 00:55:59.823
POPULATION ARE WE KNOW THAT.

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:00.356
AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:01.491
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.259
FINANCE DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:05.562
UNIT AS WELL AS THE DATA THAT WE

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.196
GOT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:06.496
INSTANCES.

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.431
IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHO THE

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:09.165
HARD TO COUNTER WHERE THEY ARE

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:10.900
SO THEN WE LOOK TO SPREAD THOSE

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.569
RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:13.837
WITH A LOOK TO SPREAD THEM BASED

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.705
UPON THE CONCENTRATIONS OF THOSE.

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:16.940
POPULATIONS IN A VERY SERIOUS OF

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:18.141
SOME AREAS HAVE VERY HIGH

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.210
CONCENTRATIONS OF LA FOR EXAMPLE

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:21.845
IS THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTY

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:23.246
RETIRE COUNTRY THE ORDERS COME

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:25.014
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- IN FACT

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:26.616
CALIFORNIA'S TEN OF THE TOP

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:32.355
FIFTY HARD DISCOUNT COUNTIES IN

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:34.157
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.358
IT'S ALL BASED UPON THAT DATA

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:36.459
AND THAT AND THE RESOURCES GOING

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:37.627
OUT ACCORDING TO THAT DATA SO

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.962
SOME AREAS WILL GET MORE MONEY

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:40.730
BASED UPON THAT NUMBER PARTY

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.866
COUNTY [inaudible]

00:56:42.932 --> 00:56:46.903
OF YOU MENTIONED -- LIMITED

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.472
ENGLISH COULD YOU GO INTO THAT A

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:50.406
LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.008
LANGUAGE ACCESS BECAUSE THERE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.343
ARE SO.

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:55.979
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.413
MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES HOME

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.682
EVERYBODY BOASTS ABOUT HOW WE

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:02.185
WERE WE ARE SO WONDERFUL AND

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:04.454
DIVERSE IN THIS STATE -- AND

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.456
COMES WITH THAT IS THE LANGUAGE

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.625
OF SO MANY CULTURES AND

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.460
COMMUNITIES SO.

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.128
TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT WELL I

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.129
KNOW THAT -- WILL PROBABLY HAVE

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.831
A A LONGER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.366
LANGUAGE ACCESS WERE THE ONLY A

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:17.300
STATE.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.935
ARE THAT HAS ACTUALLY INVESTED

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:21.104
IN OUR HAVING A LANGUAGE ACCESS

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:22.906
AND COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS.

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.007
BUT I WANT TO START REALLY HAVE

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.108
TO START THE BASELINE OF WHAT IS

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:27.110
THE US CENSUS BUREAU DOING WITH

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:28.678
THEIR LANGUAGE ACCESS.

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.712
OUR BECAUSE THEN THAT ALLOWS US

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.514
TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WHAT ARE THE

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:32.415
GAPS AND WHERE TO REFILL IT.

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:33.383
SO.

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:34.517
I THINK WE MENTIONED THAT IT'LL

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:37.020
BE THE FIRST ONLINE CENSUS EVER --

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.121
SO WERE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.522
LANGUAGE ACCESS BUT COMPUTER

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.891
LITERACY AND ACCESS -- TO

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.426
ACTUALLY THE ONLINE FORM THE

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.161
ONLY FORM WILL BE IN TWELVE

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.630
LANGUAGES THOSE TWELVE LANGUAGES

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.232
ARE IDENTIFIED FROM.

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.800
AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:51.801
THE TOTALING WHICH IS AT THE

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:53.403
NATIONAL LEVEL ARE NOT THE

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:54.671
NECESSARILY THE TWELVE LANGUAGES

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:55.638
YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.640
IN ADDITION YOU CAN GET A PAPER

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.676
FORM AND AGAIN I'M NOT WITH THE

US CENSUS BUREAU BUT I I KNOW

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.512
ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS RIGHT.

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:03.713
SO YOU CAN GET A PAPER FORM BUT

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.682
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE IN ENGLISH

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:06.449
AND IN SPANISH.

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.017

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.208
BE SO EASY TO DO.

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:06.642
OR THEY CAN JUST DO IT THROUGH

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:07.476
THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE

MEDIAN SO WHATEVER IT IS

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.982

UNDER A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT

PLACES THAT WORK WITH JUST

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.037

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:51.084
BASICALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THAT

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:52.385

ATTORNEYS -- BUT THEY ALSO DO

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:24.417
THINGS LIKE THERE'S AN

01:50:24.484 --> 01:50:26.119
INVESTIGATION UNIT THAT DOES NOT

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:28.154

ENFORCEMENT CASES.

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:34.995

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:37.230
FUNDED BASED ON USAGE SO FOR

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:39.032
EXAMPLE I DO WHY THE

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:41.201

THEY CHARGE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:47.207
BOARDS IN BUREAUS BASED ON THE

AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY SPEND

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.313

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:58.752
DID BASED ON PRO RATA SO

01:50:58.818 --> 01:50:59.419
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:00.720
DOES IS IT LOOKS AT THE LEGAL

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.389

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:03.923
SERVICES.

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.392
AND THEN ALLOCATED OUT ON TO THE

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:06.693
BOARD ANDYOUR IS BASED ON HOW

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.627
MANY POSITIONS EACH BOARDING

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.963

I SAW IN THE PAST THERE WAS SOME

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.141
CONCERN.

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.542
THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CROSS

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.377
SUBSIDIZATION FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.713
SOME OF THE BOARDS -- OR BUREAUS

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.681

UP IN THE PAST.

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:39.492

ON THE REPORTING -- SO

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:58.984
HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:00.319
CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAS DONE

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:02.121

IN THE BEST WAY -- WE HAVE FOR

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:39.965

RIGHT -- OR SOMETHING THAT WE

02:16:08.627 --> 02:16:10.562
CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:11.863
RESOURCES.

02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:13.865
OF THAT'S ONE QUESTION THE OTHER

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:15.967
IS.

02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:18.169
LOOKING UP TO BUILD.

02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:19.838

SEE THESE ARE PERMANENT THEY'RE

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:56.541
NOT GOING AWAY AFTER THE FIVE

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:57.042
THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT.

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:57.642

ALL OF THIS GREAT WORK WITH TEN

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:26.304
MILLION DOLLARS BUT I THINK IT

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:28.006
WOULD COME WITH.

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:29.975
A REAL PLAN RIGHT RIGHT BILL

SEE IT AND IT SEE IT WOULD SEEM

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.923
AS IF IT WOULD MAKE THE WORK ON

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.223
SUSTAINABLE.

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.792
AND ONE BEING ABLE TO EVALUATE

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:49.461
IN FACT ONE OF MY OUR PRIORITIES

02:17:49.527 --> 02:17:51.429
IS TO EVALUATE.

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.831
THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ARE

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.566
HAVING CURRENTLY IN HAVE HAD ON

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:57.102
THE FIELD AND TO EVALUATE HOW WE

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:59.638
ACTUALLY DO DISTURB -- BUTTE

02:17:59.704 --> 02:18:00.705
MONEY IN.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:01.873
CURRENT.

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:04.075
CONTEMPORARY LANDSCAPE.

02:18:04.142 --> 02:18:06.778
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NETWORKING

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:09.147
OR AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE?

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:11.616
HOW DO WE BECOME AS IMPACTFUL AS

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:12.183
POSSIBLE ALL THROUGHOUT THE

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:14.853
STATE WE HAVE A PRETTY?

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:17.622
ROBUST SYSTEM A NETWORK OF

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:19.858
COUNTY ARTS COUNCILS.

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:21.926
WE HAVE NAM ARTS COUNCILS THAT

WHAT THEY'RE REGION'S NEED.

02:18:32.437 --> 02:18:33.471
AND THAT'S AND AND THAT'S A

02:18:33.538 --> 02:18:35.774
NETWORK THAT WE ARE INCREASINGLY

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:38.243
MAKING MORE ROBUST AND KEEP

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:39.811
BETTER CONNECTED AND I'VE I

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:40.612

02:18:43.348 --> 02:18:45.583
AND MAKE THEM MORE EVEN MORE

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:48.720
EFFICIENT IN THEIR AREAS AND I

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.321
DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET TO THE

02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:52.791
BRICK AND MORTAR PART USUALLY

02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:54.192
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ALL

02:18:54.259 --> 02:18:54.626
I'LL.

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:56.294
LOT MORE RESOURCE BUT IF A

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.396
COUNTY AND SEE WHAT RESOURCES

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:00.432
ARE THERE AND WHERE THE NEED IS

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:01.766
MAYBE THERE ARE BRICK AND MORTAR

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:04.636
PLACES WHERE THEY CAN YOU KNOW

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:06.337
FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT AT SOME.

02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:07.172
AND ON YOUR RIGHT THIS IS A

02:19:07.238 --> 02:19:08.773
LARGER CONVERSATION THAT I'D

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.141
LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:11.209
HAVE WITH YOU.

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:12.777
I ALSO JUST LIKE TO MAKE ON ONE

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:15.680
POINT IS THAT -- WE ALSO ARE

02:19:15.747 --> 02:19:17.315
CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN.

02:19:17.382 --> 02:19:18.917
DESIGNATING CULTURAL DISTRICTS

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:20.618
AND THIS IS A LEGISLATIVELY

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:23.188
MANDATED PROGRAM -- AND WHILE

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:24.222
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF MONEY

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:25.323
THAT'S ATTACHED TO IT AT THIS

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.491
POINT BECAUSE IT'S IN ITS

02:19:26.558 --> 02:19:27.926
FORMATIVE STAGE.

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.194
IT'S ABOUT BRINGING PARTNERS

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:31.062
TOGETHER SO SOME OF THOSE

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:32.964
PARTNERS DO CERTAINLY INVOLVED

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:33.832
BROKEN MARTYR.

02:19:33.898 --> 02:19:35.266
AND AND OTHER CORPORATE

02:19:35.333 --> 02:19:37.302
PARTNERSHIPS BUT HISTORICAL

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:39.804
PARTNERSHIPS -- OUR PARTNERSHIP

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:40.638

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.675
OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:46.678
ACCESS TO AND SO I THINK THOSE

02:19:46.745 --> 02:19:47.846
THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THE

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:49.447
CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AS A

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:50.982
STATE WIDE ENTITY CAN REALLY

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:53.451
HELP THE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS.

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:55.687
CURRENTLY WE FIGURE WE'LL FIND

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:58.690
ABOUT 57% OF THE REQUESTS THAT

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:00.492
COME IN FOR US AND IF YOU LOOK

02:20:00.558 --> 02:20:02.093
AT STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.862
NONPROFIT ARTS ORGANIZATION

02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:05.096
THERE'S ABOUT.

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.264
ELEVEN THOUSAND WHICH MEANS WERE

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:09.367
FINDING ABOUT 7% -- SO YES IT

02:20:09.434 --> 02:20:10.668
SEEMS LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT BUT

02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:11.970
EVERY SINGLE INCREMENTAL

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:14.038
INCREASE TO OUR BUDGET SINCE WE

02:20:14.105 --> 02:20:15.707

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:18.910
HUGE.

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.445
HUGE DIFFERENCE AND WE BELIEVE

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:24.783
