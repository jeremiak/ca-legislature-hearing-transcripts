CURRENTLY THE PICKING OR INJURY OPERATES NEARLY TWO THOUSAND SLOT MACHINES THAT EXTRACT CHANTING GOLD RESORT AND CASINO LOCATED IN MADERA COUNTY.

I TRIED TO MANAGE A PAYING ITS PRO RATA SHARE OF COST OF THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND WHICH REIMBURSES THE STATE FOR ITS REGULATORY AND OTHER DIRECT COSTS OF GAMING. WHEN IT OPERATES. OVER THREE THOUSAND GAMING DEVICES THE TRIBAL CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY TO THE US YEAH. THIS HELPS SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF SPF PRO RATA PAYMENTS FOR UNLIMITED GAMING TRIBES. THE PICKING RANCHERIAS REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND PAYMENTS REFLECT ONGOING COMMITMENT IN A DEMO YOU WITH MADERA COUNTY TO FINDING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE SERVICES.

THE BAKING RANCHERIA CONTACTING CORPORATES TRIBAL LAW REQUIREMENTS FOR PAGING DISPUTES TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS. INCORPORATING RATHER THAN DIRECTING TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS IS RESPECTFUL OF THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT NATURE OF THE TRIBAL STATE RELATIONSHIPS. THE PICKING RANCHERIA ALSO AGREED TO ENSURE MINIMUM WAGE RATES AT LEAST AS STRINGENT AS CALIFORNIANS AND TO MAINTAIN ITS TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE R. T. L. R. O.

IN ADDITION TO THIS ANOTHER NOW STANDARD DEALER- PROVISIONS THE PICKING RANCHERIAS KELLER- INCLUDES TERMS THAT BENEFIT THE TRIBE AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. THE DEALER- PREVENTS A LABOR ORGANIZATION FROM ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE. UNDER THE TAYLOR- FOR ONE YEAR IF IT ATTEMPTS TO ORGANIZE UNDER THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT IF THE TRIBE OR THE LABOR ORGANIZATION CAN IT'S AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE DURING ORGANIZING CARRYING. THE TRIBE MAY BE REQUIRED TO AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE THE UNION WHILE THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ELECTION COULD BE DELAYED. THE DLR- ALSO INCLUDES LANGUAGE CLARIFYING THAT THE TRIBAL LABOR PANEL IS NOT SPECIFIC TO ONE TRIBE. AND THAT PARTY IS NOT REQUIRED TO EXHAUST TRIBAL COURT REMEDIES TO COMPILER AND FORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD. FINALLY IT'S A SIZE AND PARTY CHALLENGING AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR THE DUTY TO ARBITRATE IS LIABLE FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S ATTORNEYS FEES. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR CONCOCTS THEY'RE PICKING RANCHERIA COMMITTED TO ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVEW OF POTENTIAL OFF RESERVATION IMPACTS.

MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND GAMING DEVICES. WHAT IS THE THINKING THERE AND- IS THIS UNIQUE TO JUST THIS CONTACT. IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO JUSTICE CONTACTS CERTAIN OTHER TRIBES- LARGE GAMING TRIBES TEND TO HAVE SOME PROVISIONS THAT MAY ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO THE SDF ABOVE THE PRO RATA. THE REASONING BEHIND THAT IS BECAUSE- CONSISTENT WITH BIGGER- AND RECENT LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WHERE INCLUDING THESE PROVISIONS TO HELP ALLOWING FOR LIMITED GAMING TRIBES TO HAVE THEIR STF OBLIGATIONS RELIEVED SO THAT THE- COSTS OF THOSE STF PAYMENTS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- CAN BE SHARED AMONGST SOME OF THE LARGER GAMING TRIBES TO HELP BETTER DISTRIBUTE THE- REVENUE AND- BENEFITS OF TRIBAL GAMING.
