HAPPENING QUITE REGULARLY

00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:44.723 region:rollup2

APPROPRIATIONS WE APPROPRIATED

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:53.866 region:rollup2

HUNDRED POSITIONS THAT WERE

00:23:57.303 --> 00:24:01.307 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET --

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:04.677 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN --

00:24:01.307 --> 00:24:05.611 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED THAT THE TIMING OF PA

00:24:04.677 --> 00:24:07.479 region:rollup2
BRINGING THEM ONLINE WHERE THEY

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:09.548 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN --

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:11.116 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PLACED IN DMB

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:13.085 region:rollup2
OFFICES AROUND THE STATE?

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:15.721 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS REALLY WHAT THE PLAN

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:17.122 region:rollup2
IS TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIMES

00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:19.491 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN HEARING.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:21.060 region:rollup2

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.594 region:rollup2
RESIT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.364 region:rollup2

TO SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:28.667 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:29.635 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:32.171 region:rollup2
รณ WE KNOW THAT WITH THE REAL

00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:33.739 region:rollup2
AYE.

00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:35.708 region:rollup2
THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:37.509 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT THAT WE NOW HAVE

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.611 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:42.414 region:rollup2
BEFORE WOULD JUST RENEW THEIR

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:44.216 region:rollup2

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:46.285 region:rollup2
CARBON DOING THEM HAVE TO RENEW

THEM IN PERSON LIKE MYSELF.

00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:49.755 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.058 region:rollup2
CAUSING A STRAIN WE ALL WE WANT

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:54.893 region:rollup2
TO KNOW ON AGAIN DID WE ESTIMATE

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:57.262 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:57.930 region:rollup2
WHO HAD TO COME FORWARD INTO D.

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:59.832 region:rollup2
M. V..

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.201 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS DO WE ESTIMATE THE

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:03.836 region:rollup2
TRANCE THOUGH TRANSACTION TIME.

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:05.971 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PROCESS

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:07.306 region:rollup2
EACH OF THESE ARE APPLICATIONS I

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.540 region:rollup2
KNOW MY DISCUSSION WITH THE

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:10.476 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR A FEW WEEKS AGO.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.710 region:rollup2
THEN THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS BEING

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:12.778 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WE WANT TO

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.747 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S BEING

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:15.314 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED HASN'T MADE A

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:17.549 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE --

00:25:15.314 --> 00:25:18.951 region:rollup2
IN MY BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH THE

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:20.886 region:rollup2
CLERK.

00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:22.087 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:24.156 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLES THEY ESTIMATED

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:25.657 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK ABOUT ROUGHLY TWENTY

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:27.025 region:rollup2
MINUTES AND THIS IS OF COURSE

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:29.061 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL TWENTY MINUTES OF TIME

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:32.097 region:rollup2
THE DATA ENTRY?

00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:33.665 region:rollup2
THAT ON I FIGURED COULD BE DONE

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.467 region:rollup2
WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE WAITING IN

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:36.402 region:rollup2
LINE TO BE DONE AT A KIOSK THAT

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:38.203 region:rollup2
COULD BE DEBT BE DONE ONLINE --

00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:40.939 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY GOT THERE THEY COULD

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:42.975 region:rollup2
BE DONE WITH AN AYE.

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:44.443 region:rollup2
TAKING A CORRECTIVE ACTION TO

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:46.145 region:rollup2
REALLY --

00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:46.445 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT A PARTICULAR

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.179 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:51.850 region:rollup2
SITUATION [inaudible]

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:54.586 region:rollup2
ON AND THE LAST THING IS ALSO

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.888 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN THAT RENEWAL NOTICES

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:57.623 region:rollup2
ARE GOING OUT TOO LATE THAT

00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:58.957 region:rollup2

EXPIRATION OF THEIR DRIVER'S

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.535 region:rollup2
LICENSES I THINK THAT CAN BE

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:11.537 region:rollup2
FIXED I VERY EASILY BY SENDING

00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:13.639 region:rollup2
OUT RENEWAL NOTICES MUCH FURTHER

00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:16.308 region:rollup2

ASKING IF MR FRAZIER HAS ANY

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:26.351 region:rollup2
OPENING COMMENTS THEN.

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:27.953 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.587 region:rollup2

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:37.162 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:38.964 region:rollup2

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.865 region:rollup2

OUR STATE WITH OVER FOUR

00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:43.635 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES.

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:45.437 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS THE DMV IS THE FACE

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.171 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.706 region:rollup2
IT IS THE AGENCY THE

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:49.975 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S MOST OFTEN INTERACT

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:51.076 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAY.

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.411 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT IS FOR VEHICLE

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:53.145 region:rollup2

DRIVER'S LICENSE.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.183 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS IMPORTANT

00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:59.852 region:rollup2

DIEM THE DMV SERVICES.

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:04.590 region:rollup2
AS IT CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:06.758 region:rollup2
THE WAY ALL CALIFORNIANS VIEW

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.227 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.827 region:rollup2
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT HOURS

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:10.229 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE A BASIC GOVERNMENT

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:11.763 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:12.731 region:rollup2
THE RECENT SPIKE IN WAIT TIMES

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:15.400 region:rollup2
TO SHOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

THE DMV ANYWAY TO PROVIDE

00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:20.539 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:21.940 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROBLEM LIES IN A

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:23.375 region:rollup2
FAILURE OF COMMUNICATION AND

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.543 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAN BE DONE

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:30.516 region:rollup2
WELL ANY CALIFORNIA HAS A CAR

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:33.118 region:rollup2
HAS TO INTERACT WITH THE MV ON A

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:34.219 region:rollup2
YEARLY BASIS MOST CALIFORNIANS

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.753 region:rollup2

THE DMV ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:37.356 region:rollup2

PERSON.

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.995 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:44.363 region:rollup2
DMV AS AN AUTOMATED MANY OF ITS

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:47.633 region:rollup2

ONLINE OR OVER IN THE MAIL.

00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:50.135 region:rollup2
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO COME TO

00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:51.570 region:rollup2
INTO THE DMV TO RENEW THEIR

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.938 region:rollup2

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:03.682 region:rollup2
WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO RENEW

SOMEONE DOES HAVE TO VISIT THE

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.625 region:rollup2
DMV AN APPOINTMENT CAN BE MADE

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.860 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF TIME TO REDUCE WAIT

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:16.895 region:rollup2
TIMES [inaudible]

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.096 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:19.531 region:rollup2
DESPITE ALL OF THIS MANY PEOPLE

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.799 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO THE DMV TO HANDLE

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:23.035 region:rollup2
THESE TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.436 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE BE DONE ELSEWHERE.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:26.171 region:rollup2
AND DIEM BE WAIT TIMES HAVE

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:27.706 region:rollup2
BECOME INCREASINGLY LONGER MUCH

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:28.840 region:rollup2
OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH A CHANGE

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.075 region:rollup2
IN FEDERAL LIES YOUR KNOWLEDGE

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.777 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ID.

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:33.512 region:rollup2
BUT WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALSO

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:36.215 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE.

00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:37.983 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH AB

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:39.551 region:rollup2
SIXTY AB NINE THIRTY FIVE THESE

00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:40.852 region:rollup2
ARE ALL SOLUTIONS.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:43.255 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE PUT IN LEGISLATION

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:45.057 region:rollup2
HAS TO CREATE MORE TIME NEEDED

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:45.891 region:rollup2
FOR DIEM VIEW EMPLOYEES.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.292 region:rollup2
SO AFTER THE HORRORS OF

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:48.760 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THE FEDERAL

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:50.462 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ADDED AND CREATED

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.832 region:rollup2
STRICTER STATE ID LAWS WITH THE

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:55.133 region:rollup2
PAST OF THIS RELATE REAL ID ACT.

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.701 region:rollup2
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:58.203 region:rollup2
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

00:28:55.701 --> 00:29:00.238 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING.

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.872 region:rollup2
IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:02.641 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FEDERAL

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.809 region:rollup2
LAWS PASSAGE.

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:05.277 region:rollup2
EVERY STATE IS REQUIRED TO

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:06.011 region:rollup2
COMPLY WITH REAL IDEA TO

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:08.213 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WHICH TO FLY

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:10.148 region:rollup2
DOMESTICALLY.

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:11.016 region:rollup2
OR ENTRY FEDERAL FACILITY AS A

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.151 region:rollup2
RESULT THE REQUIREMENT OF

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:13.752 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:15.621 region:rollup2
YOUR DMV VISIT JUST GOT MOVED

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.955 region:rollup2
UP.

00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:18.457 region:rollup2
AND ARE CONSEQUENCES WHAT'S WILL

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:20.425 region:rollup2
HAVE TO VISIT THE DMV IN THE

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:22.194 region:rollup2
NEXT TWO YEARS TO CHANGE OUR

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:23.528 region:rollup2
LICENSES TO RELY DE.

00:29:22.194 --> 00:29:24.963 region:rollup2
THIS IS LEAD TO CONFUSION

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:26.932 region:rollup2
AMONGST OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:27.733 region:rollup2
SPEND MINUTES LONGER THAN WITH

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.101 region:rollup2
DIEM VIEW.

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:31.303 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:33.338 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY REALLY NEED --

00:29:31.303 --> 00:29:35.207 region:rollup2
WITH IT REAL ID COMPLIANCE.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.074 region:rollup2
THIS IS RESOLVED IN DELAYING THE

00:29:35.207 --> 00:29:37.609 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR EVERYONE LINED THE

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:39.144 region:rollup2
DMV.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:41.113 region:rollup2
THIS BECOMES A BIGGER HEADACHE

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:42.514 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TO GO TO DMV

00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:44.216 region:rollup2
FOR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:45.984 region:rollup2
LIKE LOSING THEIR ID'S HOW ARE

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:47.552 region:rollup2
HAVING THEIR ID STOLEN.

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:49.788 region:rollup2
IN ANTICIPATION AWAY THE PEOPLE

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:51.990 region:rollup2
COMING IN TO TRADE IN THEIR ID'S

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:53.892 region:rollup2
TO BE REAL IDEA COMPLIANT.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.727 region:rollup2
D. DMB IS GRANTED FOUR HUNDRED

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:56.395 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL STAFF WITH ANOTHER

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:59.298 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO BE ADDED BY

00:29:56.395 --> 00:29:59.865 region:rollup2
AUGUST A SMALL ADDITION FOR THE

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:01.900 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO OFFICES

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:03.535 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.836 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A DIEM V. IS SO HIGHLY

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:06.571 region:rollup2
UTILIZE IT IS ESPECIALLY

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.506 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE IS THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:09.374 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:10.942 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:12.144 region:rollup2
THE RISK OF FAILING TO DO SO CAN

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.445 region:rollup2
HAVE NEVER THE NEGATIVE

00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES ON EVERYONE'S

00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:15.781 region:rollup2
OPINIONS ON HOW GOVERNMENT

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.150 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS.

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:19.217 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE NOW.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.652 region:rollup2
I HOPE TODAY WE CAN LEARN THE

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:22.621 region:rollup2
DMB NEEDS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:23.555 region:rollup2
THIS INFLUX OF CUSTOMERS SO THAT

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:26.158 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CAN

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.725 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE THIS FINAL DEPARTMENT

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:27.926 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE THE RESOURCES IT

00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:29.094 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:30.896 region:rollup2
TO KEEP OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:31.897 region:rollup2
SATISFIED.

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:34.099 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT MR TING I THANK

00:30:31.897 --> 00:30:35.834 region:rollup2
YOU FOR CALLING THIS HERE.

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:36.268 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S FRAZIER MISTER

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.203 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE.

00:30:36.268 --> 00:30:39.004 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:40.505 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:42.274 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY HERE IN THE

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:44.309 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.343 region:rollup2
HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER VIEW OF THE

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.644 region:rollup2
WAY THAT STATE GOVERNMENT WORKS

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:49.348 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:30:45.644 --> 00:30:51.483 region:rollup2
AND THEIR INTERACTION ON A DAILY

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:53.118 region:rollup2
BASIS WITH DIFFERENT APARTMENTS

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:54.886 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:56.121 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINED AND THE DMV IS

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:58.457 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:59.891 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FACING AGENCIES THAT WE

00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:01.860 region:rollup2
HAVE HERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:03.862 region:rollup2
SO OUR CONSTITUENTS CHARACTERIZE

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.263 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.732 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT BY THE SERVICE

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:07.999 region:rollup2
THAT THEY GET AT THE

00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:09.534 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY DO

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:11.536 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:13.271 region:rollup2
SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE.

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:15.240 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC FACING ORGANIZATION OF

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.775 region:rollup2
THE STATE WHERE OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.110 region:rollup2
ARE SPENDING A DAY OF THEIR

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:19.010 region:rollup2
LIVES TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.480 region:rollup2
SIMPLE DONE.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.748 region:rollup2
IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.916 region:rollup2
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING

00:31:22.748 --> 00:31:26.017 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SOLUTION ON THIS.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:27.419 region:rollup2
BOB BUT I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:28.754 region:rollup2
CLEAR THEIR CONSTITUENTS REALLY

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:30.322 region:rollup2
DON'T CARE ABOUT.

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:31.523 region:rollup2
THE WHY.

00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:32.824 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT'S WE'RE GONNA BE

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.359 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TODAY WERE TALK

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.827 region:rollup2
ABOUT REAL IDEA WERE TALK ABOUT

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.228 region:rollup2
A BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS WERE TO

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:37.896 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT A MAYBE

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:39.264 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.165 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:41.433 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE ALL APPROPRIATE

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:43.001 region:rollup2
THINGS FOR US BUT OUR

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:44.436 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS CARE ABOUT THE WHAT

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.704 region:rollup2
THEY CARE ABOUT HOW LONG IT'S

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:47.005 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE ME TO GET MY

00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:48.607 region:rollup2
VEHICLE LICENSE --

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:50.108 region:rollup2
RENEWED HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE

00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:52.177 region:rollup2
ME TO GET THAT APPOINTMENT TO

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:53.378 region:rollup2
GET MY DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWED

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:54.579 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY REALLY

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:56.681 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO SOLVE

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:57.816 region:rollup2
TODAY SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD --

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:59.317 region:rollup2
TO BEING PART OF SOLUTION MISTER

IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:16.001 region:rollup2
IS A GOOD PLACE TO MAKE A START

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.402 region:rollup2
ASKING SOME OF THE KIND OF TOUGH

00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:18.603 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

ANSWERS.

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:24.342 region:rollup2
TO WHEN MANY CUSTOMERS ARE

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:25.577 region:rollup2
WAITING AS LONG AS EIGHT HOURS

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:27.012 region:rollup2
AT THE DMV.

00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:28.313 region:rollup2
OUR ALARM BELL SHOULD BE GOING

00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:29.881 region:rollup2
OFF SHOULD BEEN GOING OFF A LONG

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:31.149 region:rollup2
TIME AGO.

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:33.251 region:rollup2
WE HEAR A LOT OF EXCUSE MAKING

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:34.786 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS THE REAL ID IT IS

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.755 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:38.657 region:rollup2
A THIS IS THE REASON THAT THAT

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:40.392 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE DELAYS.

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:41.960 region:rollup2
BUT DOWN THIS NOT THE ONLY CAUSE

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:43.929 region:rollup2
OF THESE.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.297 region:rollup2

AND WE'RE GOING TO DELVE DEEPER

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:55.373 region:rollup2
INTO THE DELAYS CAUSED BY REAL

00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:58.210 region:rollup2
ID WHICH IS A PROBLEM.

00:32:55.373 --> 00:33:00.145 region:rollup2
BUT AS AS WELL AS HORRIBLY

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:04.416 region:rollup2
OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY [inaudible]

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:05.917 region:rollup2
AND FAILURES OF NEW SYSTEMS AND

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:07.853 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS AND

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:09.754 region:rollup2

THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THE DMB

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:14.993 region:rollup2
COLLAPSED.

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:16.828 region:rollup2
IF THAT DOESN'T TELL US.

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:18.296 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HUGE

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:19.998 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.298 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THE DMV NOTHING

[inaudible]

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:23.802 region:rollup2
ELSE WILL.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.070 region:rollup2
AS IT'S BEEN STATED EARLIER THE

00:33:23.802 --> 00:33:26.505 region:rollup2
DMB TOUCHES THE LIVES OF

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.373 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS EVERY

00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:30.141 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:30.842 region:rollup2
MANY HAVE MADE APPOINTMENTS.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.844 region:rollup2
BUT FOR OTHERS MAKING

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:35.714 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS BECOMING

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:37.415 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY NOT AN OPTION.

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:39.584 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT TIMES CAN BE WEEKS

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:42.854 region:rollup2
OR MONTHS OUT WITH A LICENSE

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:43.955 region:rollup2
EXPIRING IN JUST A FEW DAYS.

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:46.992 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM OTHER

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:49.494 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THE DMV EXISTS TO SERVE

00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:52.364 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:53.965 region:rollup2
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE TASK WITH

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:57.402 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE OF THE PEOPLE OF

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:59.237 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. TO SET UP THEIR

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:01.106 region:rollup2
LIVES.

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:02.908 region:rollup2
AROUND THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:05.210 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:07.646 region:rollup2
UP DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.548 region:rollup2
WHAT WHEN WHERE HOW AND FOR HOW

00:34:07.646 --> 00:34:10.115 region:rollup2
LONG THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:12.384 region:rollup2
APPEAR [inaudible]

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:13.752 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEM.

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.754 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO BE UP

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:18.156 region:rollup2
SPEAKING ON BEHALF.

00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:20.091 region:rollup2
OF DMB EMPLOYEES SCHOOL ARE JUST

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:22.093 region:rollup2
AS MUCH IMPACTED.

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:23.595 region:rollup2
AS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:28.033 region:rollup2
MANY ARE WORKING TWELVE HOUR

00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:29.100 region:rollup2
DAYS SIX DAYS A WEEK AND THEY

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.669 region:rollup2
ARE SAYING AND YOU WILL HEAR

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.272 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT TESTIMONY TOMORROW.

00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:36.341 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE THE EMPLOYEES TO HELP

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:38.176 region:rollup2
US WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED OVER

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:39.244 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN?

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:41.046 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:42.047 region:rollup2
TALKING TO THESE EMPLOYEES.

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:43.949 region:rollup2
THESE ARE DEDICATED DMB

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:45.317 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.152 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:49.421 region:rollup2
LOVE TO THEIR JOBS.

00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:51.556 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM THOUGH ARE ASKING.

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:53.959 region:rollup2
IS IT HOPELESS.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:56.194 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE THE NEW RECRUITS?

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:57.495 region:rollup2
IS THIS THE NEW NORMAL.

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:59.898 region:rollup2
SO WE FOUND OURSELVES TODAY A

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:01.967 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT REQUIRES ACTION

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:03.935 region:rollup2
YES BUDGETARY ACTION MAY VERY

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:05.737 region:rollup2
WELL BE NEEDED.

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:08.273 region:rollup2
BUT I AM A BIT RESISTANT TO THE

00:35:05.737 --> 00:35:08.840 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT THE SOLUTION HERE IS

00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:11.576 region:rollup2
JUST THROW MORE MONEY AT THE

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.545 region:rollup2
DMV.

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:15.080 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DONE THAT OVER AND OVER

00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:17.515 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.684 region:rollup2
WE DID IT OVER A YEAR AGO.

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:21.419 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:23.455 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PROMISED TO BE FIXED

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:24.756 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME.

00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:26.691 region:rollup2
AND NOW I SUPPOSE WE'RE GOING TO

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:28.426 region:rollup2
BE OUT [inaudible]

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:30.495 region:rollup2
REQUESTING ADDITIONAL MILLIONS

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:31.997 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS.

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:33.131 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY TO DO THE VERY SAME

00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:35.567 region:rollup2
THING YOU WERE GIVEN MILLIONS OF

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:37.936 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. TO DO.

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:39.237 region:rollup2
OVER A YEAR AGO.

00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:39.804 region:rollup2
OUT THERE ARE HIRING ISSUES

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:42.507 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MAJOR TECHNOLOGY

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:44.542 region:rollup2
ISSUES THERE ARE MANAGEMENT

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.976 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT GO FAR BEYOND REAL

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:47.846 region:rollup2
REAL ID.

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:49.514 region:rollup2
AND UP YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM.

00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:52.250 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT KIND

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:55.553 region:rollup2
OF A SERIES OF ISSUES.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:57.789 region:rollup2
IN FACT FROM INSIDE THE DMV.

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:59.858 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH REAL ID

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:01.493 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:03.495 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SO MUCH THERE'S SO

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:05.463 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE AT STAKE HERE.

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.731 region:rollup2
THAN JUST RELY DE.

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:09.267 region:rollup2

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:10.535 region:rollup2
TO DISCOVER THAT THE ESTIMATES.

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:12.837 region:rollup2
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD SHOW UP

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:16.408 region:rollup2
FOR REAL ID.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:17.942 region:rollup2
OUR WAS WOEFULLY OVER PREDICTED.

00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:20.211 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT FEWER SHOWED UP THAN

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.913 region:rollup2
YOU THOUGHT WOULD SHOW UP.

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:23.848 region:rollup2
NOW WE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.616 region:rollup2
THE PLANNING WAS SO FAR OFF THE

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.051 region:rollup2
MARK.

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:27.585 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:28.887 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.622 region:rollup2
WE MAY NOT GET TO DISCUSS ALL OF

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:32.190 region:rollup2

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:34.592 region:rollup2
BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM IN

AT THE AUDIT HEARING.

00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:41.199 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SUGGEST HIGH END UP.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:43.768 region:rollup2

STATE GOVERNMENT.

AND THIS ISN'T A CONSTITUENT

00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:45.730 region:rollup2

THE EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.107 region:rollup2
BEEN HAVING --

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:57.809 region:rollup2
YEAH AND AND CLEARLY IT'S GOTTEN

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.810 region:rollup2
MUCH WORSE --

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.178 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR --

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.879 region:rollup2
I DON'T I DON'T WANNA REPEAT A

00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:02.347 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE THINGS ON MY

00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:04.048 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES SAID BUT CLEARLY THEM

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:05.350 region:rollup2
THE DMV IS THE NUMBER ONE IN OUR

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.885 region:rollup2
ACTIONS THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.418 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH STATE GOVERNMENT IN

00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:08.486 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.689 region:rollup2
AYE WHICH MAKES A REALLY

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:12.323 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND MAKE --

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.626 region:rollup2
AND THINGS HAVE GOTTEN OFF TRACK

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:15.894 region:rollup2
--

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:19.230 region:rollup2
THAT WE IDENTIFY YOU KNOW BOTH

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:21.366 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WENT WRONG BUT ALSO

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.500 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIX IT --

00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:23.434 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.803 region:rollup2
CARROTS AND STICKS IS NOT GOING

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:27.238 region:rollup2
TO BE JUST.

00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:28.473 region:rollup2
ON THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S ALSO

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:30.141 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE MAKING CHANGES.

00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:31.276 region:rollup2
ON TO HOW WE DO THINGS AND I'LL

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:33.044 region:rollup2
BE THE FIRST IS THAT I REPRESENT

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:34.846 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY --

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:36.214 region:rollup2
AND WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY TO

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:36.814 region:rollup2
ME รณ YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:38.082 region:rollup2
SHOULD OPERATE LIKE A BUSINESS

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:40.518 region:rollup2
--

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:41.953 region:rollup2
AND I SAY TO THEM WELL YOU KNOW

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:43.421 region:rollup2
YOU RUN A BUSINESS HOW MUCH OF

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:44.055 region:rollup2
YOUR MONEY IS RESEARCH AND

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.057 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT HOW MUCH OF YOUR

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:47.725 region:rollup2
MONEY GOES TOWARDS PROJECTS.

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:48.693 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.861 region:rollup2
FAILURE?

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:51.629 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT'S YOUR TOLERANCE

00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:52.430 region:rollup2
FOR FAILURE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:54.232 region:rollup2
TRIES SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.500 region:rollup2
WORK SO IS SO I UNDERSTAND THE

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:56.668 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE YOU KNOW.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.536 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ISN'T A LOT OF

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.571 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE FOR RISK AND THEREFORE

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:00.705 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO UPDATE YOUR

00:38:59.571 --> 00:39:02.073 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS --

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:03.641 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A LACK OF INCENTIVE

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.742 region:rollup2
TO DO SO BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:06.010 region:rollup2
ABOUT FAILURE BUT WE'VE HIT

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:07.679 region:rollup2
FAILURE --

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.147 region:rollup2
AND AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

I GUESS WHEN US FEELS POSITIONS

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.583 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR.

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.217 region:rollup2
HOW MIDDLE SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.651 region:rollup2
FILL?

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:23.386 region:rollup2
AND THE THOSE POSITIONS HAVE

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:25.255 region:rollup2
BEEN FILLED ALL OF THEM.

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:26.590 region:rollup2
CRACKED SO IT WAS THE LAST

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:28.191 region:rollup2
YEAR'S A BLAST FROM.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.192 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR WE HAD TWO INTERNET

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.894 region:rollup2
WE AUTHORIZED TO UNDER NINETEEN

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:32.462 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WE ACTUALLY FILLED

01:00:30.894 --> 01:00:33.697 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.297 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN AND THIS CURRENT FISCAL

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.133 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT WERE IN.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.601 region:rollup2
POWER BUT YOU DIDN'T AUTHORIZE

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:39.102 region:rollup2
FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THAT

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:40.137 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUATION OF THE TWO

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.805 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN WE HAD OVER FILLED THAT

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.073 region:rollup2
THE TWO EIGHTEEN AND HAVE

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.907 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.108 region:rollup2
THIRTY POSITIONS.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:47.577 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE CARRY FOR TO THIS

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:48.345 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.080 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE'RE HIRING NOW WITH

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:51.248 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED AND

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.517 region:rollup2
WHAT PLANNING TO HAVE THAT ALL

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:54.718 region:rollup2
WRAPPED UP BY THE END OF AUGUST.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:56.586 region:rollup2
WITH AYE THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:58.121 region:rollup2
POSITIONS LEFT.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:59.456 region:rollup2
SO AS FAR AS A REAL LADIES GO

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.757 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE CRUX THE PROBLEM WITH

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:02.425 region:rollup2
THEIR AN UNDERESTIMATION OF

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.827 region:rollup2
FAMILY PHOTO COME FORWARD SINCE

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:05.729 region:rollup2
THAT'S BUGGING YOU DOWN THE AND

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.831 region:rollup2
WOOD WAS WHO WHO PLANNED FOR IT

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:09.132 region:rollup2
WAS A PLANNING INCORRECT.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.500 region:rollup2
NOW SO THAT SO THE CHALLENGE WAS

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.535 region:rollup2
NEVER NECESSARY IN THIS KIND OF

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.036 region:rollup2
GOES BACK --

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
TO PATTERSON'S COMMENT AS IT

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:16.506 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THE TIME FRAME FOR

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.707 region:rollup2
THE TRANSACTION THROUGH THE

EDUCATIONOF THE CUSTOMER WHAT

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:20.043 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.411 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE TIME VALUE FOR THE

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.180 region:rollup2
TRANSACTION ITSELF IT AND

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.714 region:rollup2
CHANGING IT THAT ADDITIONAL FIVE

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.449 region:rollup2
MINUTE CONVERSATION IT'S THAT

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.017 region:rollup2
THE THE TALK TIME THAT YOU HAVE

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.184 region:rollup2
TO HAVE WITH EVERY SINGLE

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.985 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WHAT IS

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.367 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME WITHOUT AN

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.802 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT.

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:37.140 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY GRABBED HER

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:38.107 region:rollup2

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:55.551 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL USE THAT EXAMPLE.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:58.421 region:rollup2
IT THE WAIT TIME IS SO LONG.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:59.956 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE IRRITATED --

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:02.058 region:rollup2
WITH YOU BOB SOMEONE.

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:04.327 region:rollup2
THERE AND ON A HOT DAY THAT SETS

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:05.962 region:rollup2
OFF SITUATIONS THAT TRANSPIRED

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:07.930 region:rollup2
THERE THAT'S BEYOND THAT THE

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:10.066 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL CONTROL --

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:12.535 region:rollup2
AGAIN IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO THE

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:14.570 region:rollup2
DMV ELISE IN MY EXPERIENCE I'M

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:16.672 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SPENT AN HOUR TO TWO

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:18.241 region:rollup2
HOURS THERE TO DMB JEST GOING

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:20.376 region:rollup2
FROM ONE PLACE --

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:21.844 region:rollup2
INCOME IN FACT TO THE OTHER AND

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:23.613 region:rollup2
SO THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS ARE

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:26.883 region:rollup2
EXPLOSIVE --

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:28.351 region:rollup2
AT THE DMV DISTANT WITH OTHER

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:30.052 region:rollup2
DMV'S BUT THE WAIT TIME IS

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AN ISSUE.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:33.656 region:rollup2
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHAT

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.358 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO DO WITH

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup2
OUR A STAR HERE WINDOW --

01:11:35.358 --> 01:11:38.194 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE --

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:39.796 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TRIAGE IN THE LINE

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:41.063 region:rollup2
THAT IF CUSTOMERS DON'T NEED TO

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.731 region:rollup2
BE THERE IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.266 region:rollup2
RIGHT DOCTORS THAT CAN GIVE IT

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:44.367 region:rollup2
BACK LEISURE TIME SO THAT WE

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:47.637 region:rollup2
COULD DO THAT WAIT TIME.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:48.271 region:rollup2
WE ALSO ARE OUT WORKING TO GET

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.438 region:rollup2
THE CUSTOMERS IN SOONER BECAUSE

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.907 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.008 region:rollup2
WEATHER IT IS HOT AND PEOPLE

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:54.010 region:rollup2
CAN'T STAND OUT THERE IN.

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:55.678 region:rollup2
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO WE ARE

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:57.880 region:rollup2
WORKING TO EXPEDITE TO GET

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:59.749 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS IN THE OFFICE SOONER

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.150 region:rollup2
IN SO WE HAVE A SIMPLIFIED THAT

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:03.586 region:rollup2
IF YOU JUST ARE A VEHICLE

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:05.154 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION DRIVERS LICENSE --

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:07.290 region:rollup2
OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO OR

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.791 region:rollup2
DISABLED THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING

TO GET THAT TYPE THE TICKET AND

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.994 region:rollup2
NOT A GET WE HAD --

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:13.629 region:rollup2
TWELVE CARRIERS OF THE TICKETS

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.997 region:rollup2
WE JUST SIMPLIFIED IT TO SEVEN

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.165 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES SO THAT YOU'RE JUST

AND THEN OUT WORK TO GET THE

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:22.939 region:rollup2
TECHNICIANS TO CALL YET SO WE

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.340 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:25.541 region:rollup2

ONE MORE THING THAT WE ALSO DID

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:52.001 region:rollup2
ADD AN EXPEDITE WINDOW SO HEARD

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.069 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FROM SOME OF THE

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:54.136 region:rollup2
MEMBERS --

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:55.504 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU HAVE A SIMPLE

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.973 region:rollup2
TRANSACTION YOU'RE PICKING UP

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.441 region:rollup2
IT'S STABLE PLACARD THE PICKING

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:59.809 region:rollup2
UP YOUR PLAY TO JUST GETTING A

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:01.377 region:rollup2
VEHICLE RECORD OR YOU NEED TO

COME BACK AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.413 region:rollup2
PUT YOUR SMOG WE HAVE AT IT

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:05.948 region:rollup2
CREATED WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:07.250 region:rollup2
EXPEDITE YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:08.584 region:rollup2
GET A TICKET AT STAR HERE

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.685 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE TRIAGE PROCESS

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.120 region:rollup2
YOU'LL BE DIRECTED STRAIGHT

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.887 region:rollup2
INSIDE AND BE PROCESS.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.723 region:rollup2
BUT THE COULD YOU HAVE HEARD%

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:15.258 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS I WAITED FIVE OR SIX

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.859 region:rollup2
HOURS AND I HAD A SIMPLE FIVE

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:18.561 region:rollup2
MINUTE TRANSACTION SO WE HAVE

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:21.364 region:rollup2
CREATED THOSE EXPECT WINDOWS YOU

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:23.599 region:rollup2
CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THAT WINDOW.

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:24.166 region:rollup2
AND NOT EVEN GET A TICKET.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:24.467 region:rollup2
THEY COULD MISS SPENT A FEW

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:28.170 region:rollup2
UP.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:30.539 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE TERM --

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:30.840 region:rollup2
COMPLETE COMPUTER GLITCHES

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.642 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.477 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:34.744 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HAVING SUBSTANTIAL AND

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:37.146 region:rollup2
RECURRING.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:39.448 region:rollup2
OUTAGES.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:41.484 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST GLITCHES.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:43.286 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OUTAGES HAVE YOU HAD?

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
RECENTLY.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:48.124 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DO THEY LAST?

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:50.593 region:rollup2
AND DO YOU HAVE ABSOLUTE

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN YOUR TECHNOLOGY.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:54.764 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:56.599 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTING.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:57.466 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE SUGGESTED THAT YOU

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.969 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT LIKE

01:13:57.466 --> 01:14:01.537 region:rollup2
TEXTING AND OTHER THINGS GOING.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.905 region:rollup2
SO THE TEXAS SOME OF THAT

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.273 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTS

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:06.075 region:rollup2
US OF TAXING IS DONE TO THE

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:07.376 region:rollup2
VENDOR FOR ACUMEN SYSTEM SO THEY

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:09.812 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:11.414 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OUR SYSTEMS A WE DID

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:13.949 region:rollup2
EVAN I DID YESTERDAY --

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:16.819 region:rollup2
WE WERE RECOVERED BY ABOUT THAT

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:18.421 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT A TEN O'CLOCK NINE

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:20.022 region:rollup2
THIRTY TEN O'CLOCK --

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:21.457 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS REQUIRE BUT NOT ALL THE

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:23.326 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WERE DOWN ALL OVER WITH

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.260 region:rollup2
WORKSTATIONS WERE DOWN --

01:14:23.326 --> 01:14:25.261 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.663 region:rollup2
WORKSTATIONS ARE DOWN THE REST

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:28.431 region:rollup2
WERE COMING BACK THAT AND SO WE

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.765 region:rollup2
WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:31.167 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TROUBLE SHOULD WHAT

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:35.705 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WAS.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:37.740 region:rollup2
AND OF WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:39.575 region:rollup2
OF ALL AND I THE EXACT NUMBER I

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.043 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME TODAY

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:42.678 region:rollup2
WILL GET BACK WITH YOU FOR THAT.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.612 region:rollup2
NOW WE ARE MARCHING AND DEFTLY

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.980 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH OUR PARTNER THE

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:47.149 region:rollup2
PART OF TECHNOLOGY AND

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.152 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING WHERE WE WILL WORK TO

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:51.754 region:rollup2
DO ANY UPGRADES AFTER HOURS AND

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.788 region:rollup2
ON THE WEEKENDS AND THEN TO

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.924 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE DO ADEQUATE

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:56.592 region:rollup2
TESTING SO THAT THESE GLITCHES

01:14:54.924 --> 01:15:00.296 region:rollup2
IN THE SYSTEMS DO NOT GO DOWN.

01:14:56.592 --> 01:15:02.064 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A A SENSE OF I CAN.

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:03.899 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:06.268 region:rollup2
CAN'T YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:08.738 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF HOW MANY OUTAGES.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:10.139 region:rollup2
CAN'T I'M BUT MAYBE NOT A NUMBER

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:12.375 region:rollup2
BUT REGULARLY [inaudible]

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:14.143 region:rollup2
BODY.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:16.178 region:rollup2
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:18.647 region:rollup2
NOT VERY OFTEN.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:20.616 region:rollup2
HOW SERIOUS ARE YOUR OUTAGES?

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:21.617 region:rollup2
SO ANYMORE AND SO.

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.251 region:rollup2
I THERE MAY BE WHO IN GOT

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:23.853 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY WAS FOR A COUPLE HOURS

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:25.988 region:rollup2
--

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:27.790 region:rollup2
DEFTLY WE WORK QUICKLY WITH THE

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:30.559 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY OTHER MAY

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:32.661 region:rollup2
BE INSTANCES WHERE I IT COULD BE

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:34.130 region:rollup2
A A HALF A DAY BUT DIDN'T AND WE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.330 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.831 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.767 region:rollup2
IN TROUBLE SHOOT AND FIND THE

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:38.734 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSE AND WE WILL WE WORK

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:40.536 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:41.704 region:rollup2
WORK WITH AND THE VENDORS THAT

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.872 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OUR SYSTEMS.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:45.474 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF FINDING WHAT THE

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:46.842 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSE IS AND SO WE HAVE

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.477 region:rollup2
WORKED QUICKLY DETERMINE WHAT

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:50.312 region:rollup2
THAT ROOT CAUSES AND THEN WORK

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:51.447 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE WHAT TECHNOLOGY DO WE

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.114 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO WE NEED TO REPLACE A

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:53.883 region:rollup2
PART.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:55.151 region:rollup2
WAS THERE ANY A FAILURE OF OF

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:56.719 region:rollup2
THE HARDWARE --

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.887 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE TO WORK WILL GET TO

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.622 region:rollup2
FIGHT TO THE VENDORS THAT WE

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.323 region:rollup2
HAVE ON ON SITE THAT WE PARTNER

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:02.158 region:rollup2
WITH TO GET EQUIPMENT AND AS

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:04.226 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AS THEY CAN.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.527 region:rollup2
I'M ASKING FOR A DESCRIPTIVE

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.529 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:07.063 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY THAT WAS NOT AN

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:09.865 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:12.068 region:rollup2
OFTEN.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.536 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT A LITTLE.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
EVERY NOW AND THEN I MEAN YOU

01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:17.773 region:rollup2
YOU YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA OF

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:20.142 region:rollup2
THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW OFTEN.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:21.343 region:rollup2

THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YES

01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:30.991 region:rollup2
--

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:32.192 region:rollup2

THE GROUND THAT YOU ONLY FIND

01:55:38.799 --> 01:55:40.967 region:rollup2
OUT IF YOU'RE OUT IN ABOUT A

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.402 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:43.570 region:rollup2
WITH THE AUDIT --

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:45.172 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE

01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:46.273 region:rollup2
ARE EXPERIENCING.

01:55:45.172 --> 01:55:47.908 region:rollup2
I WHAT WHAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:48.675 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE FIVE MINUTE

01:55:47.908 --> 01:55:49.209 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CHECK TO SEE IF YOU

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:50.577 region:rollup2

01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:53.647 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY AS WE HEAR FROM FOLKS

01:55:50.577 --> 01:55:54.981 region:rollup2
WHO WERE ASKED SEVEN TIMES.

01:55:53.647 --> 01:55:56.316 region:rollup2

01:55:58.952 --> 01:56:01.988 region:rollup2
I'M SO ON THE SUGGESTIONS LIST

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.223 region:rollup2
IS TO MAKE SURE IF SOMEONE'S

YOU'RE GETTING IT RESOLVED AND

01:56:08.862 --> 01:56:12.399 region:rollup2
NOT MULTIPLE.

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:13.767 region:rollup2
CHECKS AND MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO

01:56:12.399 --> 01:56:16.036 region:rollup2
DO THIS BECAUSE THE DUPLICATION

01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:17.771 region:rollup2
OF EFFORT ON THAT IS IS AN ISSUE

01:56:16.036 --> 01:56:19.372 region:rollup2
CYPRESS SHAPE THE TRIAGE AND THE

01:56:17.771 --> 01:56:19.906 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION OF IS VERY GOOD BUT

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:22.476 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:23.577 region:rollup2

IDEALLY I DID HEAR THAT FOR AND

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:33.587 region:rollup2

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:35.522 region:rollup2

MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEY HAVE THE

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:50.370 region:rollup2
SAME DOCUMENTS A SO THE SPEED UP

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:51.838 region:rollup2

HAPPENING FREQUENTLY AND IT'S

01:59:29.496 --> 01:59:31.664 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SHUTTING DOWN THE

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.933 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO SELF HELP.

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:35.068 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION IN CONVERSATION HERE

01:59:42.776 --> 01:59:47.313 region:rollup2

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:51.151 region:rollup2
THINGS I FACES AS I LISTEN TO

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:52.752 region:rollup2
EVERYONE I GUESS I'M I'M

01:59:51.151 --> 01:59:54.187 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ELATED.

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:56.089 region:rollup2
THAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE

01:59:54.187 --> 01:59:57.223 region:rollup2
HAVING SUCH POOR SERVICE.

01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:58.858 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE THE MOST POOR

01:59:57.223 --> 02:00:01.761 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AWAITS HAVE BEEN

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:03.797 region:rollup2
FOUR AND FIVE HOURS AT THE DMV.

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:05.865 region:rollup2
UP I'VE SELDOM GOING TO THE DMV

02:00:03.797 --> 02:00:07.067 region:rollup2
BUT THE LAST TIME I WAS IN WHICH

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.667 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT FIVE SIX OUT YEARS AGO

02:00:07.067 --> 02:00:08.768 region:rollup2
US FOR FIVE SIX HOURS IT TOOK

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:10.537 region:rollup2
ME.

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:12.105 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE HOURS TO GET

02:00:10.537 --> 02:00:13.606 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SIMPLE DONE SO IT

02:00:12.105 --> 02:00:14.641 region:rollup2
IMPORT COMMUNITIES WITHOUT AND

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:16.042 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT AND IN FACT --

02:00:14.641 --> 02:00:18.278 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST OF

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:20.313 region:rollup2
US SELDOM GO TO OUR DMV AND I GO

02:00:18.278 --> 02:00:22.015 region:rollup2
TO THE ONE IN OF LET MYSELF OR

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.882 region:rollup2
HER SOMEWHERE IN POWER WAY.

02:00:22.015 --> 02:00:24.417 region:rollup2
WHERE I KNOW THAT THE SERVICE IS

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:26.419 region:rollup2
BETTER AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:27.721 region:rollup2
IS BETTER AND FASTER SO THE FACT

02:00:26.419 --> 02:00:29.722 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ALL NOW EXPERIENCING

02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:31.624 region:rollup2
THE PAIN IS GOOD BECAUSE THEN

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:33.226 region:rollup2
WILL GET SOMETHING DONE?

02:00:31.624 --> 02:00:36.196 region:rollup2
ABOUT DMV BECAUSE BEEN ONE OF

02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:36.963 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY OF NIGHTMARE AND MOST

02:00:36.196 --> 02:00:37.931 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT POOR.

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:39.099 region:rollup2
OF EITHER BECAUSE OF THE LONG

02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:40.266 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THE LONG LINES BUT

02:00:39.099 --> 02:00:41.668 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WHAT APPEARS TO BE

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:42.836 region:rollup2
THE POOR SERVICE.

02:00:41.668 --> 02:00:44.003 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK

02:00:42.836 --> 02:00:45.638 region:rollup2
THERE AND I THINK THAT HAS TO BE

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:46.206 region:rollup2
SOME WORK DONE ON THAT IN TERMS

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:47.140 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE AN

02:00:46.206 --> 02:00:49.109 region:rollup2
ATTITUDE.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:51.077 region:rollup2
OF OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO COME

02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:52.579 region:rollup2
INFILL LIKE BR BOTHER TO THE

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:54.380 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK THERE AND

02:00:52.579 --> 02:00:55.715 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE LAST TIME I WAS IN

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:58.051 region:rollup2
SOMEONE SAID --

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:59.419 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU CALLED THE FOURTH

02:00:58.051 --> 02:01:01.254 region:rollup2
THAT TIME FOUR THIRTY FIVE

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:02.088 region:rollup2
O'CLOCK THEY SIT WAITED THIRTY

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:03.556 region:rollup2
MINUTES BEFORE AND YOU'LL SEE

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:04.791 region:rollup2
WILL ASK THAT WILL NEVER GET OUT

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:07.127 region:rollup2
OF HERE BECAUSE HE DIED WHEN IN

02:01:04.791 --> 02:01:08.027 region:rollup2
AT NOON AND IT WAS ALMOST FIVE

02:01:07.127 --> 02:01:09.462 region:rollup2
INNOCENT WILL NEVER GET OUT

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:10.964 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH.

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:12.866 region:rollup2
TIME TO WAIT ON ALL OF US AND

02:01:10.964 --> 02:01:14.467 region:rollup2
THEY SAID WATCH AND SEE THIRTY

02:01:12.866 --> 02:01:15.535 region:rollup2
MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME WAS OVER

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:17.070 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE APPEARED

02:01:15.535 --> 02:01:18.471 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE OTHER

02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:19.672 region:rollup2
ROOMS WHO WOULD DOING WHATEVER.

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:21.107 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALL CAME IN AND SURE

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:23.776 region:rollup2
ENOUGH WE ALL GOT OUT IN TIME

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:24.978 region:rollup2
FOR BY THE GET OFF WORK ON TIME.

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:25.979 region:rollup2
SO I BEFRUGAL AS THE IF WE

02:01:24.978 --> 02:01:28.281 region:rollup2
PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN OUT

02:01:25.979 --> 02:01:29.749 region:rollup2
EARLIER YEAR UP HOURS EARLIER IF

02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:31.084 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAD BEEN BASICALLY ARE

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:32.051 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:34.053 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:35.421 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS IS

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:37.457 region:rollup2
AS MOST FOLKS ARE FEELING THE

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:38.591 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THIS IS THE

02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:40.493 region:rollup2
ONE AGENCY THAT PROBABLY EVERY

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.895 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN TOUCHES.

02:01:40.493 --> 02:01:42.428 region:rollup2
THE ONE AGENCY ALL OF US DON'T

02:01:41.895 --> 02:01:44.063 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY DEAL WITH WEB

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:45.965 region:rollup2
WELFARE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:47.634 region:rollup2
AGENCIES BUT WE OUGHT NOT HAVE

02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:48.768 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SOME FORM OF ID.

02:01:47.634 --> 02:01:50.470 region:rollup2
AND THAT COMES FROM THE ENVY

02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:52.505 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS WE ALL HAVE TO GO

02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:53.439 region:rollup2
THERE SO I I NOT ELATED THE

02:01:52.505 --> 02:01:55.275 region:rollup2
TROLL IN PAIN WITH ME BUT

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:56.509 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT IT GIVES ME GREAT

02:01:55.275 --> 02:01:58.011 region:rollup2
COMFORT TO KNOW THAT.

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:59.312 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF ALL THE COMMUNITY

02:01:58.011 --> 02:02:00.947 region:rollup2
SCREAMING THAT SOMETHING WILL

02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:02.448 region:rollup2
HAPPEN ALSO IN SOME POOR

02:02:00.947 --> 02:02:03.950 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE SERVICE

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:05.785 region:rollup2
AND TO GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUT

02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:06.152 region:rollup2
FASTER BECAUSE THE ATTITUDE WAS

02:02:05.785 --> 02:02:07.387 region:rollup2
ALMOST AS IF.

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:08.688 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU FOLKS HAVE NOWHERE TO

02:02:07.387 --> 02:02:10.456 region:rollup2
GO ANYWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL

02:02:08.688 --> 02:02:12.225 region:rollup2
POOR SO YOU YOU CAN AFFORD TO

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:13.726 region:rollup2
SIT AROUND DMB FOR FIVE AND SIX

02:02:12.225 --> 02:02:14.994 region:rollup2
HOURS TO GET AN ID CARD OR

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:18.464 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT MAY BE?

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:19.265 region:rollup2
WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU

02:02:18.464 --> 02:02:20.567 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS THAT?

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:22.101 region:rollup2
UP HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE

02:02:20.567 --> 02:02:23.303 region:rollup2
FOR US TO GET SOME SEE SOME

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:25.071 region:rollup2
PROGRESS BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN

02:02:23.303 --> 02:02:26.372 region:rollup2
LOVE MEANT ALL DAY LONG AS WE

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:27.640 region:rollup2
SIT HERE AND ASK YOU QUESTIONS

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:29.042 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU'RE AWARE OF IT AND

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.776 region:rollup2
IT'S A HUGE AGENCY.

02:02:29.042 --> 02:02:31.878 region:rollup2
CALLED THAT HAS LOTS OF

02:02:29.776 --> 02:02:35.715 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WE HAVE GIVEN YOU MORE

02:02:31.878 --> 02:02:37.183 region:rollup2
RESPOND ABILITIES AS WE GIVEN AT

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:39.752 region:rollup2
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT OTHER THINGS

02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:40.987 region:rollup2
IN A BIT AT AT THE REGISTRATION

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.722 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE IN YOU.

02:02:40.987 --> 02:02:44.257 region:rollup2
SO WE WEWE PUT A LOT OF THINGS

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:45.425 region:rollup2
ON THE MP I RECOGNIZE THAT AND

02:02:44.257 --> 02:02:46.626 region:rollup2
AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE DO THAT

02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:48.328 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THINKING THAT THAT

02:02:46.626 --> 02:02:50.029 region:rollup2
REALLY TAKES AWAY FROM.

02:02:48.328 --> 02:02:50.630 region:rollup2
THE OTHER TAX WHICH IS USED TO

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.599 region:rollup2
BE JUST GIVING OUT A DRIVER'S

02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:53.533 region:rollup2
LICENSE AND THEN WITH THE ID'S

02:02:52.599 --> 02:02:55.468 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO BUDGET

02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:56.202 region:rollup2
VOTER REGISTRATION AND NOW WE

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:57.237 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH TELL.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:59.138 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS

02:02:57.237 --> 02:03:00.607 region:rollup2
GETTING LICENSES SO THAT THE

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:02.108 region:rollup2
AGENCY AS WELL OKAY.

02:03:00.607 --> 02:03:03.309 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE WHEN WE

02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:04.777 region:rollup2
CAN SAY WHO THIS IS GOING TO BE

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:06.479 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:08.214 region:rollup2
THE DO YOU KNOW WHEN OF FOLKS

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:09.616 region:rollup2
WILL PROBABLY BE FEELING THAT IT

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:11.084 region:rollup2
IS REASONABLE AND I DON'T KNOW

02:03:09.616 --> 02:03:12.418 region:rollup2
WHAT REASONABLE IS IS REASONABLE

02:03:11.084 --> 02:03:13.853 region:rollup2
AN HOUR DMB.

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:15.021 region:rollup2
IT I'M IS THAT A REASONABLE TIME

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:16.089 region:rollup2
FRAME TO PEOPLE TO SAY WHAT I'M

02:03:15.021 --> 02:03:18.091 region:rollup2
GOING TO SPEND OUR GOOD ON THE

02:03:16.089 --> 02:03:18.625 region:rollup2
DMV GET MY LICENSE RENEW TO GET

02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:20.226 region:rollup2
WHATEVER DONE.

02:03:18.625 --> 02:03:22.262 region:rollup2
AND TEND TO MY BUSINESS THAT I

02:03:20.226 --> 02:03:22.762 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT'S NOT COMPLICATED

02:03:22.262 --> 02:03:23.863 region:rollup2
BUSINESS BUT JUST BASIC

02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:24.831 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:26.266 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN WE WILL

02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:27.800 region:rollup2
SEE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:03:26.266 --> 02:03:29.535 region:rollup2
BECOMES IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.536 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:31.504 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY WHAT WE WANT

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:33.139 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:34.607 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS ALL WE WANT MORE THIS

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:36.609 region:rollup2
WOMAN WHAT WAS THAT THAT'S FINE

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.710 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND WE MAY BE ABLE

02:03:36.609 --> 02:03:38.912 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU PROBABLY

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:40.446 region:rollup2
WILL MORE THAN LIKELY IF THIS

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:41.748 region:rollup2
STUFF IS FORTY YEARS OLD WE WILL

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:43.249 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE TO DO THAT.

02:03:41.748 --> 02:03:44.617 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WAS

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:46.185 region:rollup2
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:46.719 region:rollup2
THEY WON'T BE DANCING IN THE

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:47.820 region:rollup2
STREET BECAUSE YOU GOT NEW

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.788 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS.

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:50.123 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE DANCING IN THE

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:51.157 region:rollup2
STREETS BECAUSE THEY SPEND OUR

02:03:50.123 --> 02:03:53.192 region:rollup2
INDIAN MOVIE THIS.

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:54.861 region:rollup2
IS JUST THAT SIMPLE HOWEVER WE

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:56.296 region:rollup2
DID IT THERE WILL BE DANCE IN

02:03:54.861 --> 02:03:58.031 region:rollup2
THE STREETS FOR THAT REASON.

02:03:56.296 --> 02:04:00.700 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT THE

02:03:58.031 --> 02:04:01.701 region:rollup2
TIMELINE.

02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:03.369 region:rollup2
ALL DAY LONG BUT WHAT IS THE

02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:05.038 region:rollup2
TIMELINE WHEN WE WHEN DO YOU

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:06.372 region:rollup2
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE

02:04:05.038 --> 02:04:07.507 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SOME GREAT IDEAS THE

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:08.574 region:rollup2

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:05.972 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT AND

02:09:04.337 --> 02:09:07.840 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS HEARING ILLUSTRATES

02:09:05.972 --> 02:09:08.841 region:rollup2
THAT POINT TO YOU --

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.742 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE CONSTITUENTS

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:10.376 region:rollup2
THAT IT ATTEMPT TO MEET IT STUCK

02:09:09.742 --> 02:09:12.078 region:rollup2
IN MY MIND THE MOST IS A HE SAT

02:09:10.376 --> 02:09:14.947 region:rollup2
--

02:09:12.078 --> 02:09:16.315 region:rollup2
WILL WEAKEN APPOINTMENT FOR OVER

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:18.384 region:rollup2
FIVE HOURS IN THE HILLCREST DMV

02:09:16.315 --> 02:09:19.485 region:rollup2
ON IT IS OBSERVATION HAS A LONG

02:09:18.384 --> 02:09:20.653 region:rollup2
HISTORY IN BUSINESS IN THE BIT

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:24.023 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR.

02:09:20.653 --> 02:09:27.226 region:rollup2
IF THIS WAS A BUSINESS IT WOULD

02:09:24.023 --> 02:09:29.262 region:rollup2
BE OUT OF BUSINESS WE HAVE

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:30.963 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS --

02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:32.932 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:33.633 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT REAL IDEAS A

02:09:32.932 --> 02:09:35.001 region:rollup2
DRIVER BEHIND THIS.

02:09:33.633 --> 02:09:37.403 region:rollup2
AND I HEARD SOME DESCRIPTIONS

02:09:35.001 --> 02:09:38.971 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHY PROPS THE PLANNING DID

02:09:37.403 --> 02:09:40.506 region:rollup2
MIND OF EXACTLY WITH EXPERIENCE

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:41.807 region:rollup2
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:43.709 region:rollup2
ON IS THERE ANY STATE IS DOING

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:45.311 region:rollup2
THIS CORRECTLY MEAN EVERYONE IS

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.878 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS OBLIGATION HEAVY TALK

02:09:45.311 --> 02:09:46.112 region:rollup2
TO YOUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:47.680 region:rollup2
STATES.

02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:48.848 region:rollup2
BY THE EXPERIENCE IS SOMETHING

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.915 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE HERE ARE THERE

02:09:48.848 --> 02:09:51.317 region:rollup2
OTHERS THAT ARE GETTING IT RIGHT

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:52.685 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING SHOULD

02:09:51.317 --> 02:09:53.986 region:rollup2
WE DO THAT HERE I GO THERE ARE

02:09:52.685 --> 02:09:54.654 region:rollup2
SOME STATES ARE EXPERIENCE SOME

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:55.154 region:rollup2
OF THIS --

02:09:54.654 --> 02:09:57.556 region:rollup2
SAME -- NEW

02:09:55.154 --> 02:09:59.392 region:rollup2
MEXICO IS ONE THAT IMPLEMENTED

02:09:57.556 --> 02:10:01.027 region:rollup2
AND NEW YORK IT'S IMPLEMENTED

02:09:59.392 --> 02:10:02.795 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE STATES AND WE

02:10:01.027 --> 02:10:04.063 region:rollup2
HAVE OUT TALK TO THOSE STATES IN

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:05.131 region:rollup2
AND ASKED FOR THEIR IN SHARING

02:10:04.063 --> 02:10:05.965 region:rollup2
THEIR THE BEST PRACTICES IN

02:10:05.131 --> 02:10:07.900 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE

02:10:05.965 --> 02:10:09.869 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING SO WE DO.

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:11.070 region:rollup2
I HAVE THAT BUT DATA AND THE

02:10:09.869 --> 02:10:12.305 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE STATES ARE NOT AS

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:13.839 region:rollup2
BIG AS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

02:10:12.305 --> 02:10:15.107 region:rollup2
LARGEST POPULATION AND SO WE

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:16.142 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGE IN TERMS

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:17.677 region:rollup2
OF SERVING.

02:10:16.142 --> 02:10:19.178 region:rollup2
UP OUR CITIZENS A LOT OF STATES

02:10:17.677 --> 02:10:21.047 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT SMALLER POPULATION

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:21.947 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD NOT GET THAT THEY

02:10:21.047 --> 02:10:22.248 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:23.916 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD.

02:10:22.248 --> 02:10:24.884 region:rollup2
ARM AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:26.285 region:rollup2
WEREN'T HAVING IF THERE WERE NO

02:10:24.884 --> 02:10:27.553 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE TO THIS PROBLEM

02:10:26.285 --> 02:10:29.121 region:rollup2
YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE OF

02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:29.455 region:rollup2
A BAD DAY FOR YOU GOT A LOT

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:30.389 region:rollup2
WORSE RIGHT.

02:10:29.455 --> 02:10:31.891 region:rollup2
NOW BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT OTHER

02:10:30.389 --> 02:10:33.359 region:rollup2
STATES ARE EXPERIENCING THIS IS

02:10:31.891 --> 02:10:35.261 region:rollup2
WHAT SOME OF THE STATES ARE SOME

02:10:33.359 --> 02:10:37.530 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

02:10:35.261 --> 02:10:39.098 region:rollup2
AND IN SO AND YOU KNOW WE DEFTLY

02:10:37.530 --> 02:10:40.666 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTACT OTHER STATES IN

02:10:39.098 --> 02:10:41.801 region:rollup2

COPY THOSE OUT WE WILL AND

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:50.843 region:rollup2

MORE POSITIONS THAT YOU MENTION

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.350 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN

02:10:55.948 --> 02:10:58.417 region:rollup2
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM.

02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:00.086 region:rollup2
THAT'S REAL MONEY.

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:02.254 region:rollup2

GRANTS AND WE HAD DONE SOME

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:13.132 region:rollup2
THINGS TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES

02:11:11.597 --> 02:11:15.601 region:rollup2

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:52.104 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF OUR POSITIONS WE

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:53.906 region:rollup2
HAVE HIRED THE FIVE HUNDRED AND

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:55.307 region:rollup2
FIFTY I THINK AND THEN THAT OF

02:12:05.351 --> 02:12:08.220 region:rollup2
HIM FOR THE THOSE POSITIONS IN

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:10.055 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.856 region:rollup2
ARE BEING DISCUSSED BY THOSE

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:12.224 region:rollup2
PERMANENT HIRES [inaudible]

02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:13.759 region:rollup2

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:20.900 region:rollup2
SO THAT I'M THE ONE THAT ARE IN

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:23.068 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET ASK THOSE A BIT OF A

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:24.670 region:rollup2
MULTI YEAR TERM AND THE ONES FOR

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:26.038 region:rollup2
THE TWO THIRTY WE WOULD PROBABLY

02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:27.573 region:rollup2
LOOK SINCE WE KNOW THAT IN THE

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.641 region:rollup2
OUT YEARS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

02:12:27.573 --> 02:12:29.842 region:rollup2
STILL RAMP UP YOU KNOW AS WE

CLOSE.

02:12:29.842 --> 02:12:32.278 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY TWENTY ORIGINAL BOMB

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:33.779 region:rollup2
PROJECTION WAS THAT THERE'S ANY

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:35.181 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE COMING IN TO GET THE

UP.

02:12:39.018 --> 02:12:44.190 region:rollup2
SO THE TWO THIRTY WE WOULD

02:12:40.219 --> 02:12:45.458 region:rollup2
PROBABLY KEEP.

02:12:44.190 --> 02:12:46.325 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR AND THAT WE BE ASKING

KEPT OVER TIME THAT IS CORRECT

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:39.512 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY AS WE HIRE EMPLOYEES

02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:40.913 region:rollup2
THERE IS A HIGH ATTRITION RATE

02:13:39.512 --> 02:13:41.947 region:rollup2
WITH A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS.

02:13:40.913 --> 02:13:44.416 region:rollup2
NO RATE THOUSAND PLAY IN TOTAL

BY IRAQ I GUESS THAT'S ONE

02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:58.764 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RECOUP

02:13:57.830 --> 02:14:00.299 region:rollup2

LOOK FOR TREE AT THE LOOK FOR

THE TRIAGE LINE AT THE PERSON

IN THIS TRIAGE THAT SITUATION

02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:38.757 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY LOCATION IT'S OUT OF

02:16:38.090 --> 02:16:39.625 region:rollup2
YOUR TV.

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:40.959 region:rollup2
SET EVERY LOCATION ANY OTHER

02:16:39.625 --> 02:16:42.294 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TIPS FOR FOLKS I THINK

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:43.062 region:rollup2
THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES THAT

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.830 region:rollup2
THAT THE DIRECTORS ALSO

02:16:43.062 --> 02:16:46.331 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS A VERY GOING TO GET

02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:47.266 region:rollup2
A REAL ID ACT ON OUR WEBSITE WE

02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:48.734 region:rollup2
HAVE A CHECKLIST.

02:16:47.266 --> 02:16:49.668 region:rollup2
THAT ACTED INTERACTIVE CHECKLIST

02:16:48.734 --> 02:16:51.804 region:rollup2
AS EARLY AS YOU GO THROUGH THE

02:16:49.668 --> 02:16:54.039 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO SAY OKAY HAVE THIS

02:16:51.804 --> 02:16:54.707 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT FOR A REAL ID THE HAVE

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:55.774 region:rollup2
THE STOCK IN THE STOCK AND THEN

02:16:54.707 --> 02:17:01.180 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS A PRINT OUT OF THE

02:16:55.774 --> 02:17:03.916 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL.

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.783 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ANYTHING.

02:17:03.916 --> 02:17:06.251 region:rollup2
THEY COME IN IN THAT THEY'RE

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:07.486 region:rollup2
MISSING AND DOCUMENTS SO THAT

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:08.687 region:rollup2
THE MATTER OF YOU KNOW THE NAY

02:17:07.486 --> 02:17:09.955 region:rollup2
THAT THE GO BACK HOME AT THE

02:17:08.687 --> 02:17:11.690 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.

02:17:09.955 --> 02:17:13.125 region:rollup2
SO THEN THEY'VE LOST THAT TIME

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:14.460 region:rollup2
I'M AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:17:13.125 --> 02:17:16.428 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A HUGE

02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.062 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION I'M FROM A CONCERT

02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:17.930 region:rollup2
REBEKAH BUT THAT'S THAT WHEN

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:18.697 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE DIRECTOR

02:17:17.930 --> 02:17:20.165 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WANT EITHER.

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:22.134 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF BIG THINGS ON THE

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:23.302 region:rollup2
TRIAGE IS THE TRY CATS AT THE

02:17:22.134 --> 02:17:24.536 region:rollup2
FRONT RIGHT IF WE CAN HAVE THAT

02:17:23.302 --> 02:17:25.304 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF THEY'RE NOT WAITING

02:17:24.536 --> 02:17:27.673 region:rollup2
IN THAT THAT.

02:17:25.304 --> 02:17:29.208 region:rollup2
THAT PREACH YOU LINE FOR THE OUR

02:17:27.673 --> 02:17:30.542 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY SAY DO YOU HAVE

02:17:29.208 --> 02:17:31.543 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT NOT BECAUSE IF NOT

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:31.910 region:rollup2
THEN HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO

02:17:31.543 --> 02:17:33.145 region:rollup2
DEAL.

02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:34.413 region:rollup2
BY THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS

02:17:33.145 --> 02:17:36.181 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:17:34.413 --> 02:17:38.383 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO REITERATE.

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:39.218 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:17:41.687 --> 02:17:44.389 region:rollup2
BIGGEST THINGS.

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:46.859 region:rollup2

ABLE. TO GO TO JUST THINK ABOUT

WAS COMPASSIONATE WOULD JUST

02:23:00.939 --> 02:23:03.875 region:rollup2

02:23:02.541 --> 02:23:05.610 region:rollup2
THAT UNTIL YOU HAVE A A A

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:06.745 region:rollup2

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:40.312 region:rollup2
ON THAT IMMEDIATELY.

02:23:38.877 --> 02:23:42.981 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THAT YOU

02:23:40.312 --> 02:23:44.683 region:rollup2
HAVE BY DOING THIS PERPETUATED.

02:23:42.981 --> 02:23:46.551 region:rollup2
OF THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T

02:23:44.683 --> 02:23:48.920 region:rollup2
TRUST YOUR AGENCY WHEN MISTER

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:50.355 region:rollup2
PATTERSON HAS TO ASK YOU OVER

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:52.424 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER.

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:53.358 region:rollup2
COMPUTER OUTAGES AND GLITCHES

02:23:52.424 --> 02:23:54.860 region:rollup2
ARE COMMON AND YOU REFUSE TO

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:56.962 region:rollup2
ANSWER THE QUESTION IT DOESN'T

02:23:54.860 --> 02:24:00.165 region:rollup2
MAKE ME FEEL VERY TRUSING THAT

02:23:56.962 --> 02:24:00.165 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE MAKE

02:24:00.232 --> 02:24:02.634 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

02:24:00.899 --> 02:24:03.969 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE HERE

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:06.104 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THE BEST INTENTIONS.

02:24:03.969 --> 02:24:09.107 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST.

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:12.644 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS NOT AN HONEST TIME

02:24:09.107 --> 02:24:13.712 region:rollup2
AND I I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

02:24:12.644 --> 02:24:15.113 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF PUTTING BENEFITS WAS

02:24:13.712 --> 02:24:17.148 region:rollup2
TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER.

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:18.817 region:rollup2
ON IT CERTAINLY MAKES PEOPLE

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:19.851 region:rollup2
MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT.

02:24:18.817 --> 02:24:20.986 region:rollup2
THE ATTEMPTS YOU KNOW IN THE

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:22.354 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AND THE

02:24:20.986 --> 02:24:24.089 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY SO I JUST WANT TO

02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:25.724 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

02:24:24.089 --> 02:24:26.858 region:rollup2
WHY SO MANY OF US BROUGHT UP I

02:24:25.724 --> 02:24:28.293 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU MY CONSTITUENTS SAW

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:29.895 region:rollup2
THAT IMMEDIATELY.

02:24:28.293 --> 02:24:31.796 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED AT

02:24:29.895 --> 02:24:32.531 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF ANGER PEOPLE HAVE

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:34.166 region:rollup2
HAD.

02:24:32.531 --> 02:24:34.766 region:rollup2
IN MY COMMUNITY WHEN THEY SAW

02:24:34.166 --> 02:24:36.701 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN I POSTED THAT LETTER

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:38.403 region:rollup2
--

02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:39.604 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO PIGGYBACK ON

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:40.972 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MS BAKER HAD SAID

02:24:39.604 --> 02:24:42.774 region:rollup2
THAT I HAD WRITTEN DOWN AS WELL

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:44.209 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS ABOUT YOUR COMMENT

02:24:42.774 --> 02:24:45.544 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT WORKING WITH

02:24:44.209 --> 02:24:46.711 region:rollup2
YOUR PARTNERS WITH YOUR PARTNERS

02:24:45.544 --> 02:24:47.913 region:rollup2
LIKE TRIPLE A AND I THINK THAT'S

02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:48.813 region:rollup2
GREAT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:24:47.913 --> 02:24:50.182 region:rollup2
THAT REDUCES.

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:51.383 region:rollup2
THE DEMAND ON THE FACILITIES

02:24:50.182 --> 02:24:53.118 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU WORK WITH YOUR PARTNERS

02:24:51.383 --> 02:24:54.753 region:rollup2
BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING

02:24:53.118 --> 02:24:56.388 region:rollup2
UP A SORT OF A DUAL TRACK OF THE

02:24:54.753 --> 02:24:57.189 region:rollup2
HAVES AND HAVE NOTS WITH THE

02:24:56.388 --> 02:24:58.456 region:rollup2
HAVES.

02:24:57.189 --> 02:25:00.225 region:rollup2
BEING ENCOURAGE HEY.

02:24:58.456 --> 02:25:01.359 region:rollup2

02:25:00.225 --> 02:25:02.327 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:03.662 region:rollup2
OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A TRIPLE

02:25:02.327 --> 02:25:04.696 region:rollup2
A PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY THAT

02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:05.797 region:rollup2
IF THEY CAN DO IT TO NOT HAVE

02:25:04.696 --> 02:25:07.065 region:rollup2
GOOD YOUR FACILITY.

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:08.300 region:rollup2

02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:10.936 region:rollup2
RESOURCES YOU'RE PUTTING INTO

02:25:09.501 --> 02:25:12.203 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTNER PROGRAMS TO KIND

02:25:10.936 --> 02:25:13.338 region:rollup2
OF GIVE A FAST TRACK BECAUSE

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:14.506 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FAST TRACK FOR PEOPLE

02:25:13.338 --> 02:25:15.974 region:rollup2
WHO CAN AFFORD IT.

02:25:14.506 --> 02:25:17.075 region:rollup2
I AND MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU'RE

02:25:15.974 --> 02:25:18.743 region:rollup2
PUTTING RESOURCES THERE INSTEAD

02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:20.478 region:rollup2

OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING

02:25:25.884 --> 02:25:28.320 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:30.722 region:rollup2

YOU HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY?

02:25:35.427 --> 02:25:39.497 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU'RE PUTTING RESOURCES

02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:41.366 region:rollup2
THERE FOR AND AND YOU KNOW

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:42.634 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT APPEAL PEOPLE OFF

02:25:41.366 --> 02:25:44.369 region:rollup2

THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE EARLY ON

02:28:46.417 --> 02:28:50.221 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS JUST MANDATE WAS.

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:51.289 region:rollup2
SENATE AND BELIEVE IN TWO

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:53.024 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FIVE THERE WERE

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:55.059 region:rollup2
GRANTS THAT WERE AVAIL ARE

02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:56.561 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO DIFFERENT STATES TO

02:28:55.059 --> 02:28:58.763 region:rollup2
DO THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS

02:28:56.561 --> 02:28:59.864 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING THAT WAS OFFERED.

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:01.566 region:rollup2
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT FUNDING

02:28:59.864 --> 02:29:04.803 region:rollup2
IS NOT COMPENSATING US FOR THE

02:29:01.566 --> 02:29:06.704 region:rollup2
THE FULL COST OF WHAT THIS IS.

02:29:04.803 --> 02:29:08.206 region:rollup2
SO I'M SUGGESTING THAT WE TRY TO

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:09.174 region:rollup2
CALCULATE WHAT THAT IS FOR THE

02:29:08.206 --> 02:29:10.909 region:rollup2
REAL ID AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S

02:29:09.174 --> 02:29:12.777 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES HERE BUT AT LEAST

02:29:10.909 --> 02:29:13.878 region:rollup2
FOR THE REAL ID PART AND THAT WE

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:15.013 region:rollup2
DO.

02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:16.714 region:rollup2
AS THIS COMMITTEE ON A

02:29:15.013 --> 02:29:19.150 region:rollup2

02:29:16.714 --> 02:29:21.219 region:rollup2
FEDERAL DELEGATION.

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:22.086 region:rollup2
TO HELP US FULFILL THAT UNFUNDED

02:29:21.219 --> 02:29:23.655 region:rollup2
MANDATE FINANCIALLY SO IT

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:24.789 region:rollup2
DOESN'T OFF.

02:29:23.655 --> 02:29:28.693 region:rollup2
THIS HUGE AMOUNT DOESN'T FALL

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:30.061 region:rollup2
