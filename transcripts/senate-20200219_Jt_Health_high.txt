TO DISCUSS HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT MANDATES ALSO THE- ANTICIPATE SOME PEOPLE MAY WHICH MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT- FROM MANY WHO BELIEVE EXISTING COVERAGE IS NOT ADEQUATE AND OTHERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT PREMIUMS FROM DATING COVERAGE FOR MORE SERVICES. AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR DISCUSSIONS OKRA KERR INCOMING BUT SO IS THE LAW THE DELIBERATE. LEGISLATION I GUESS I SHOULD INDICATE- THAT IN A RELEASE- THROUGH THAT TO HAVE FIVE CARE WOULD HERE THAT- AS OUR MUTUAL COMMITTEE CHAIR WE THINK IT'S A MOMENT FOR OF. FLAT. MANY OF THESE ISSUES IN THE- THREE HAVING THIS INFORMATIONAL AND ALSO FOR PUBLIC. WE HAVE A SIGN LIST NOT SORRY JUST LOOKING RIGHT NOW SO FOR PUBLIC HAVE COME TO THE MICROPHONE. ALL RIGHT SO WELL BUT THAT I'M GOING TO OPEN UP WITH THE NEW TO REMOTE ON HEARING ONE OF TEACHER WOULD TO. A THIS HERE WITH HIS OPENING. WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU TENER PAN AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY TO. DISK FOR FULL THANK YOU FOR ALL FOR BEING HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT MANY HEALTH CARE ISSUES THIS YEAR- SPECIALLY HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AND HOW WE CAN CONTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS. SO THE MANDATE DISCUSSION KIND OF FITS WITHIN THE PRIORITIES- WITH WITHIN THESE PRIMARIES IT'S HELPFUL TO ROOM BE REMINDED OF OUR CURRENT MANDATES. AND HOW WE CHOSE ARE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS WE SEE NEW PROPOSALS TO ADD- HEALTH CARE MANDATES OUTSIDE THE CURRENT. ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT PACKAGE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF ANY NEW BENEFITS AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE COST TO THE STATE SO- I'D LIKE TO I SEE. IN THIS WAY. WANTS TO SPEAK AROUND TAKE OVER THE MEETING HERE BUT MISSED WOULD YOU WOULD YOU HAVING. THE CARD THANK YOU I'VE- THAT WERE THIS HEARING. WE SEE THAT HEALTH CARE AND THE WAY WE PROVIDED- EVOLVES OVER TIME AND IT'S GOOD TIME TO REVISIT THIS AND LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO BEFORE WE BRING UP OUR FIRST PANEL MAY REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON- SOME WAYS HOW WE GOT WORRIED GUIDE SO- SO WHEN. CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO EMBRACE THE ACA- THE FOR CARE ACT- WE DID- WE WERE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO IDENTIFY- A PLAN THAT FORM THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS SO THE LAW- IN TERMS OF HOW TO DETERMINE THE TERM THAT. IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IS AT THAT TIME I WAS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE WORKING WITH- CENTER HERNANDEZ WAS DURING THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW- AND OTHER- LEGISLATORS AS WELL NO WE- WE ACTUALLY SAID WELL. THERE'S WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT- WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT SERVE COMPREHENSIVELY AND- NO AND THE AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE BY I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE DO IDENTIFY GAPS IN COVERAGE DÃ¢N DELPHI THINGS THAT. THAT THAT HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING FOR PATIENTS- AS WELL- TO- TO RECEIVE HELP IN- AND OF COURSE THEY DO TURN TO THE LEGISLATORS TO TRY TO HELP OUT- AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL. AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO LOOK AT THE LARGER PACKAGE SO IF FOR EXAMPLE JUST A YEAR AND I WANT TO THANK. WITH HIS LEAD. TO GET THIRTY TWO. BASIC TYPES HOW DO WE SELL STABLE. THE AND WE'VE YOU KNOW WE PASSED A PENALTY FOR A STATE PANEL TO. IN THE MANDATE AT THE AC BUT THAT MAY WE'RE NOW REQUIRING PEOPLE- TO GET COVERAGE THAN WE HAVE TO THEREFORE BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT THE COST IS AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO. ADOPTED SUBSIDIES IN FACT I'M PROUD TO SAY COVER CALIFORNIA RECENTLY SAID THE ONLY. LARGE INCREASE IN PEOPLE AND ROLLING IN OUR COVER CALIFORNIA PLANS THIS YEAR THANKS TO THE POLICY DECISIONS WE MADE. THAT ALSO BY THE WAY LEAD TO A- LESS THAN 1% INCREASE ON AVERAGE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA PLANS. FOR THIS PAST YEARS WELL AND- SO THAT'S WHAT% WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AS WELL AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THOSE DON'T HAPPEN IN ISOLATION. AND THAT'S WAY. WELL WE- WERE ABLE TO DO THOSE THINGS WE ALSO VERY CONSCIOUS OF. HE P. I'D SHOP JUST. IS HAVE SOMETHING THE AC OVER THESE ANY YEARS AND TRY TO DO SUCCESSFUL IN PAST. EVEN AGAIN. SOME PRESSURE YOU KNOW SOME DECISION MADE IT SO LEVEL WOULD THREATEN TO DESTABILIZE ARE ACTUALLY DRIVE UP COSTS AND ON MARKET TO TAKE THOSE STEPS. AND WE NEED AND SO THAT THIS HEARINGS THE TIME OF IT'S BEEN MANY SINCE SORT OF KIND OF TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE MORE COMPREHENSIVELY. TODAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. AND AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO SHE OUT COMING TO TEST IN ALL OF YOU WHO ARE. TO LISTEN TO THE DISCUSS. SO WITH THAT. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN I. AGREE MORE ON MANY THE POINTS YOU YOU WERE AT THE TIME WHEN I LOT US WAS. IN THE AND INFANCY IN NOW WE ARE WELL PAST THAT SOME PRETTY AND- NUMBER FOR COVER CALIFORNIATHIS YEAR BY WAY TO FOR. EIGHTY TH. I BELIEVE IS THE NEW NUMBER WHICH IS A IS A- STE. FOR FROM PAST AND HERE WE IN A STATE WHERE WERE SO ADVANCE. IN THE AREA WELL STATES CONTINUES SO WE'VE WERE CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK IT'S OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MAKE MAKE IT MAKE SURE THAT THE MAIN MAIN STABLE AFFORDABLE. AND DELIVERS ON THE PROMISE TO CALIFORNIANS SO. WE'D LIKE TO BRING UP A PANEL OF THE FIRST PANEL IT'S GONNA BE. HERE IN BRING UP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HERE SO- FORCE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO SIT. SO FROM PERSONAL WILL BE A JUDGE PHILLIPS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT MANNISH- MANAGED HEALTHCARE. BRUCE HANDS THE SENIOR POLICY. ATTORNEY. HOUSE IN REFER BRANCH CAL. APARTMENT IN JAN. FELL OFF FILLS ON. THE F. OUR AROUND EXCUSE ME. I'M GLAD IT'S NOT THAT DOES A HAVE A PATTERSON RIVER IT FOR THIS JOB. AND THE DEPUTY TO FOR MANAGED DIVISION AND GEAR IN COURT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM. SO START IN THE OVAL WILL GO THROUGH THE ORDER ACTUALLY THAT WE CALLED IT OUT SO PLEASE I WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THIS PHILIPS. THANK YOU SO THANK YOU SENATOR PAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS JENNY PHILLIPS AND- I WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE BENEFITS HEALTH PLANS MUST PROVIDE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. WILL ALSO DISCUSS ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. AB WHICH ARE REQUIRED UNDER BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. SO THE DIMINISH THE REGULATES THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ABOUT 96% OF COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN ENROLLMENT. THIS INCLUDES- ALL MANAGED CARE MODELS LIKE AGING MOST PPO THOSE AND OTHER COMMERCIAL DESIGNS AS WELL AS MOST OF THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WE REGULATE HEALTH PLANS BY REVIEWING AND APPROVING HEALTH PLAN DESIGNS OR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY CALL THEM- INSURING FINANCIAL STABILITY SO MAKING SURE PLANS ARE PAYING FOR WRITERS- MONITORING PROVIDER NETWORKS AND- AUDITING PLAN PROCESSES. THE DAMAGE THE ALSO ASSIST CONSUMERS BY RESOLVING COMPLAINTS WITH HEALTH PLANS AND ENSURING CONSUMERS ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES- WE ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. WITH THAT IN MIND- I'LL JUMP IN AND FOCUSED ON THE TYPE OF BENEFITS THAT HEALTH PLANS MUST COVER. SO ALL FULL SERVICE HAVE A COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING THOSE IN THE INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP AND LARGE GROUP MARKETS. MUST PROVIDE ADAM MINIMUM BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES ARE DEFINED AS PHYSICIAN SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTATION AND REFERRALS HOSPITAL INPATIENT SERVICES AN AMBULATORY CARE SERVICES. DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC THERAPEUTICAL RADIOLOGICAL SERVICES HOME HEALTH PREVENTIVE HEALTH EMERGENCY CARE SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE ABLE AS AN ABLE AS TRANSPORT TO RESIST AS WELL AS OUT OF AREA COVERAGE. AND HOSPICE. SO THESE ARE THE CORE SIDE A BROAD SCOPE BENEFITS THAT ACTUALLY PREDATE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF MANDATED COVERAGE UNDER THAT CALIFORNIA'S KNOCKS KEEN ACT. IN FACT HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO COVER BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES- I WOULD JUST STOP HERE NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION OF BASS CAN BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES DOESN'T ACTUALLY INCLUDE A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT MORE LATER BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT- BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT IT WASN'T IN THE LAST. TEN SO HOW. MUCH COVERAGE THESE CAN. OF BASS HEALTH SERVICES WHEN MEDICAL NECESSARY SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE COPAYMENTS DEDUCTIBLES OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT ARE PROVED BY THE TEAM MADE STATE. THE REQUIREMENT TO COVER HEALTH CARE SERVICE. IS INTENT BROUGHT. THE B. BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES CATEGORIES ENCOMPASS ALMOST EVERY STANDARD MEDICAL SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE THE CATEGORY OF EMILY TORY CARE SERVICES INCLUDE OUTPATIENT CARE SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT SERVICES. PHYSICAL THERAPY SPEECH THERAPY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SERVICES AND OTHER HOSPITAL SERVICES WHICH CAN REASONABLY BE PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE TORY BASIS. BECAUSE THIS CAST SUCH A WIDE NET. THE SPECIFIC TREATMENTS REQUIRED WE COVERED AS BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE AS TREATMENTS OF ALL SO DO THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH PLANS. THE PRIMARY LIMITATION ON A HEALTH PLAN'S REQUIREMENT TO COVER BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES IS THAT THE SERVICE MUST BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY THIS LIMITATION IS NOT A BRIGHT LINE RULE. SINCE WHAT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ONE PERSON IS NOT ALWAYS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE NEXT THE KNOX KEEN ACT GOVERNS THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT HEALTH PLANS USED. TO DEVELOP MEDICAL NECESSITY COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS AND ALSO PROVIDES PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS APPEAL RIGHTS TO CHALLENGE TO NILES OF COVERAGE THE KNOX KEEN ASKED ESTABLISHES A REVIEW PROCESS CALLED INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW OR I AM ARE. AND IN RELEASE CAN YOU THIS PROCESS AT NO COST TO THEM TO CHALLENGE A HEALTH PLANS MEDICAL NECESSITY DENIAL IN SUCH CASES AN INDEPENDENT CLINICIAN REVIEWS THE REQUESTED SERVICE AND THE PATIENT'S FILE. THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE PATIENT. IN THIS WAY THE KNOX KY ACT IN. HOW PLANS COVER ALL BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR EACH ENROLLEE. SO THAT'S BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES SO IN ADDITION TO THOSE BROAD CATEGORIES THE KNOX KEEN ACT INCLUDES MANY CONDITION SPECIFIC ENUMERATED COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT EVEN PREDATE THE ACA MOST OF THEM PREDATE THE ACA. EXAMPLES INCLUDE SPECIFIC MANDATES RELATED TO BREAST CANCER CERVICAL CANCER PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING COMPREHENSIVE SCREENING AND PREVENTIVE CARE FOR CHILDREN IS ALSO MANDATED INCLUDING IMMUNIZATIONS. REPRODUCTIVE CARE INCLUDING CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE AND MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INPATIENT CARE FOLLOWING CHILDBIRTH ARE ALSO INCLUDED. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL MANDATES RELATED TO CHRONIC CONDITIONS THESE INCLUDE DIABETES CARE INCLUDING TESTING SUPPLIES AND MANDATES RELATED TO HIV AND AIDS AND OSTEOPOROSIS. OTHER SPECIFIC MANDATES INCLUDE PROVISIONS ON RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND ORTHOTICS. SOME OF THESE MANDATE ONLY APPLY TO THE GROUP MARKET WHILE OTHERS APPLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL THE VERY BASED ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE. BUT ANOTHER MAJOR CATEGORY OF ADDITIONAL MANDATES- ARE THE MANAGE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH PARITY LAW WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. AND REQUIRES COVERAGE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES FOREIGN RELEASE AT ANY AGE AND OF. THE MOTIONAL DISTURBANCES OF CHILDREN HEALTH PLANS MUST ALSO COVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR AUTISM AND PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER. OKAY SO THIS SUMMER WHERE WE ARE- AT THE TIME OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACA ALL FULL SERVICE HEALTH PLANS. REGULATED UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACTS. AND STILL ARE ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES COMPLY WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS SPECIFIC MANDATES AND COVER MENTAL HEALTH FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN ON THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITION. AB RIGHT TO OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA. ALREADY HAD ALREADY REQUIRED COVERAGE OF THIS BROAD RANGE OF HEALTH SERVICES THIS WAS NOT TRUE NATION WIDE RANGE. THE ACA CHANGE THAT ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIRED ALL INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP. JUST INDIVIDUAL IN SMALL GROUPS ARE NOT LARGE GROUP- HEALTH PLANS TO INCLUDEA BASELINE SET OF BENEFITS CALLED ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FOR EACH BASE RIGHT. SECTION THIRTEEN OH TWO OF THE ACA REQUIRES THESE PLANS COVER THESE FALL AND TEN TEN CATEGORIES OF THE AGE BEATS SO YOU HAVE. ABLE TO PATIENTS SERVICE. EMERGENCY SERVICES HOSPITALIZATION MATERNITY AND NEWBORN CARE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY'RE BACK REHABILITATIVE AND ABILITY OF SERVICES AND DEVICES LABORATORY SERVICES PREVENTIVE AND WELLNESS SERVICES AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PEDIATRIC SERVICES INCLUDING ORAL AND VISION CARE. AT THE TIME THE ACA WAS ENACTED. HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA WERE FOR THEM PART ARE COVER MANY THE AGE BEES BY VIRTUE OF THE EXISTING COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW NEVER THE LESS THE ACA REQUIRED INDIVIDUAL STATES TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT BENEFITS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN EACH OF THE EACH BE CATEGORIES. AND PUT SOME CONSTRAINTS ON HOW CITIES COULD DEFINE THEM CHIEF AMONG THOSE CONSTRAINTS IS THIS CONCEPT OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN. STATES WERE INSTRUCTED TO CHOOSE AMONG SEVERAL OPTIONS OF EXISTING GROUP PLANS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME TO SERVE AS THE DESIGNATED BENCHMARK PLAN. THE BENCHMARK PLAN CHOSEN BY THE STATE DEFINES THE SCOPE OF THE H. B. COVERAGE. IF THE BENCHMARK PLAN IS SILENT AS TO THE COVERAGE OF A CATEGORY B. H. B. THE STATE MUST SPECIFY. HOW THAT THOSE SERVICES WOULD BE COVERED THE KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH LAN SMALL GROUP THIRTY HMO PLAN. IS CALIFORNIA'S BENCHMARK PLAN. CALIFORNIA'S BENCHMARK PLAN INCLUDES ALL LEGALLY MANDATED COVERAGE AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY ELEVEN INCLUDING BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AND THE VARIOUS SPECIFIC COVERAGE MANDATES I DISCUSSED EARLIER ADDITIONALLY THE LAW INCLUDES PEDIATRIC VISION CARE COVERED UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES VISION PLAN AND PEDIATRIC DENTAL AS COVERED UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BENEFITS OF FOR THOSE CATEGORIES. THE EACH BEES ARE ALSO VERY COMPREHENSIVE HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT UNLIMITED AND FALL GENERALLY WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN. IF THE STATE DESIRES TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT MANDATES IT MUST TO FREE THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT MANDATE THAT THAT'S ADDED. SO FAR THIS HAS NOT OCCURRED IN CASH AND IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT ENACTED ANY NEW BENEFIT MANDATES THAT ACTUALLY EXCEED THE H. B. SO THAT TAKE US TO. DAY WITH RESPECT TO THE BENEFITS THAT TEAMMATES SEE REGULATED HEALTH PLANS MUST COVER AND SO JUST TO WRAP UP ITS- I WAS THE GIVE IT SORT OF AS BUILDING BLOCKS BUT YOU HAVE THE BASIC HEALTH CAE SERVICES AT THE BOTTOM. AS THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE THEN THERE'S ALSO A SERIES OF STATUTE CONDITION SPECIFIC MANDATES AND THEN YOU HAVE EACH BEES WITH A pKIND OF PUT OVER HERE BECAUSE OUR PLANE JUST TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS. AND SO WITH THAT- THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS PERHAPS AT THE END OF THE PANEL SO WE'LL HAVE ALL FOR YOU PRESENT AND I THINK- WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M BRUCE SEE I AM THE- SEED. AT THE CALIFORNIA OF INSURANCE. AS OF MY COLLEAGUE JENNY HAS THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE FOR BOTH DEPARTMENTS IS SIMILAR BUT THE INSURANCE CODE HAS SOME DIFFERENCES HICH REFLECTS ITS EVOLUTION OVER TIME. PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE LEGISLATURE HAD PASSED A APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SPECIFIC MANDATED BENEFITS- FIFTEEN MANDATED OFFICE OF COVERAGE IN THE GROUP MARKET AND OTHER MANDATE SUCH AS TO THE MATERNITY COVERAGE MANDATE FOR ALL INSURANCE MARKET SEGMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHEN HE IN TWENTY TWELVE THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS BENCHMARK PLAN WAS FIRST SELECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE- AS IT WAS A KAISER SMALL GROUP HMO PLAN. WHICH EXISTED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT THAT BENCHMARK PLAN SELECTION BROUGHT THE CONCEPT OF BASIC HEALTH SERVICES. FROM THE KNOX KEEN CODE INTO THE INSURANCE CODE- FOR INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP NON GRANDFATHERED POLICIES SO SOME OF THE ACA COMPLIANT POLICIES HOWEVER. OF BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES. DOES NOT CURRENTLY APPLY IN THE INSURANCE LARGE GROUP MARKET OR IN THE- GRANDFATHERED PRE ACA PLANS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON LAST YEAR INTRODUCED- ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWO FOUR SIX- WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE- OF. A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES RUBRIC INTO THE LARGE GROUP MARKET- IT WAS HELD IN SUSPENSE AND THE- SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE THINGS ARE PANEL WILL BE DISCUSS OUR OUR OPPORTUNITY. THAT ARE PERIODICALLY MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH FEDERAL REGULATION TO MAKE CHANGES TO A STATES ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT PACKAGE- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. FEDERAL RULES PERMIT AT THE STATE'S TO RECONSIDER THEIR E. H. BEES FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN COVERAGE- AT THAT TIME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A DIFFERENT- BENCHMARK PLAN THE CALPERS KAISER HMO. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ENHANCED COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN AREAS NOT COVERED BY THE EXISTING- BENCHMARK PLAN- WORK THE EXISTING SOME GROUP. PLAN AT LIMÃ³N TO MEDICAL COVERAGE- IT DID NOT COVER SUCH ITEMS AS WHEELCHAIRS WHERE AS THE CAL PLAN CALPERS PLAN WOULD HAVE COVERED THOSE ITEMS- ALTERNATELY OF AFTER ANALYSIS THAT THE- SUCH A CHANGE WOULD HAVE A PREMIUM IMPACT OF. 1% OR LESS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT A PREMIUM. IT WAS DECIDED TO RETAIN THE CURRENT SMALL GROUP PLAN YOU'LL HEAR FROM OTHER PRESENTERS THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO RECONSIDER- ARE. HE H. P. SELECTION HOWEVER THAT RECONSIDERATION IS NOW CONSTRAINED BY OF FEDERAL RULES THAT DID NOT. PERTAIN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SO THE LATITUDE FOR OUR SELECTION OF A DIFFERENT EACH BE PLAN MAY BE MORE LIMITED. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO DEFER TO MY OTHER PANELISTS. GOOD AFTERNOON A SENATOR PAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS JAN FALLS AROUND THEM. AND THEN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE PLAN MANAGEMENT DIVISION THE COVER CALIFORNIA SO I WILL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW THE STATE BENCH MY PLAN. HAS HELPED COVER CALIFORNIA SET BENEFITS IN THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON HEALTH PREMIUMS AS WELL AS THE IMPLICATIONS OF ADDING OR CHANGING BENEFITS. AS YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAY THE ACA REQUIRES ARE CONTRACTED HEALTH PANS WHICH WE REFER TO AS Q. H. P. ISSUERS. BOTH AN INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS TO FIVE THE TEN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS SO ALTHOUGH I HAVE A CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT REGULATE DICTATE WHICH BENEFITS ARE COVERED WE DO HAVE A STANDARD PLAN SIGNS ALL HEALTH PLANS THAT CONTRACT WITH COVERAGE. FOR ANYA MUST OFFER THE SAME COST SHARING AMOUNTS FOR CONSUMERS THAT PURCHASE HEALTH CARE THROUGH US ALSO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT PURCHASE HEALTH CARE THROW OFF EXCHANGE MARKET WHICH I'M SURE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. SO THE STANDARD DESIGNS HAVE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COVER CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SERVICES SUCH AS PREVENTATIVE CARE WITHOUT COST SHARING SO THAT THESE ARE THINGS SUCH AS YOUR ANNUAL WELLNESS VISITS IMMUNIZATIONS AND CERTAIN TYPES OF SCREENINGS. SO OUR COVER BENEFITS- ARE SIGNIFICANT AS THEY HAVE SAID A STRUCTURE TO HELP CONSUMERS SEE CARE AND ALSO EMPOWERS THEM TO MAKE THE BEST. FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS WHAT BUT IN ACCESS TO MULTIPLE PRODUCTS T DIFFERENT SHARE OPS. TO COVER CALIFORNIA HAS. BOB WITH I DON'T. THE BROWN THE SERVER THE- IN THE- PLANS IN EACH ONE OF THESE MIDDLE TIER HAVE BEEN. WITH THE COST LEVELS. FOR EXAMPLE THE PLAN ME AT THE EXPERIENCE BUT WHEN CA. SIX SERVICE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND JUST ON THE RIVER ARE PART IN PLANT A HIGH PREMIUM BUT IT MAY HAVE THE- OUT OF POCKET. SO THIS BENEFITS. ALSO GO OUR HOW PLANS IN SETTING THEIR- SO HEALTH PLANS IN THEIR PRE. BASED PREEMIE. ON MULTIPLE. SUCH AS- OF SPIES SERVICES. THE POPULAR DEMO. SUCH AS THE A THE GENDER AND THE FOR MAY. ON THE HEALTH WERE OF POP AND- THE BEER GRAPHICALLY EXT. THERE'S A LOT OF. BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION'S AND SO CALORIE CHEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES ARE EVEN MORE PER. THAT TRACK POSITION AND IS A OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THE NORTH IN AREAS HAVE VERY LIMITED NUMBER PROVIDE FIRST. LANCE OPPOSITE TEAM IS BASED UPON THE PER THAT. AND WHO THEY CON WITH AND WITH THE- MIDDLE GROUPS IN HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IN THE COURSE STRUCTURE THE- THESE. WERE SERVICES ARE SUCH A TO THE DEATH. THE CO PAY AND THE CO AND- ALL THESE FACTS PLAY. THE PRE SET ANNUAL FOR HOW PLANS. SO IF THE STATE TAKES. TO MAN NEW BY. THAT ARE IN A- TO THE CURRENT PENSION PLAN. HEALTH PLAN WE NEED TO KIND AN AFTER OR NOW. TO ASSESS TYPES. AND HOW COSTLY THAT ADDITIONAL SERICES THEY ALSO NEED TO REJECT HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY THINK WILL UTILIZE A SERVICE. AND THEN DETERMINE THE COST THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE MONTHLY PREMIUMS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ANY INCREASE THE PREMIUM WILL ALSO APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN WHAT WE CALL AN OFF EXCHANGE PRODUCTS. SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT SO HEALTH PLANS REQUIREDTO OFFER THE SAME OR WHAT WE CALL THE- PRODUCT. TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE ROLLED OFF THE CHANGE IS SO THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO AND THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL CITY MORE THAN YOU SOME DATA FOR. TWENTY TWENTY. THEIR PRODUCT YOU HAVE THE SAME BEEN DESIGN. THE SAME PRETTY AND THE HAVE TO SAY CASHIER. SO ANY CHANGES IS MADE THAT WAY IMPACT THE PRE FOR THE COVERAGE FOR OUR ON EXCHANGE WILL ALSO OCCUR TO THE EXCHANGE MAYOR AS WELL TO SO DURING TO AND NINE THE PROCESS 87% OF OUR COVER CALIFORNIA IN QUALIFY FOR THE FED VAN PREMIUM CREDIT THAT OTHERWISE REFERRED TO AS A T. C. HOWEVER EIGHT SEES CAN ONLY USED FOR THAT ARE CAN IS HELP. SO THIS INCLUDES A SIR THAT THE FULLER THE PENSION PLAN IN ANY STATE IN EXCESS PRIOR TO JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE FOR THE ACA A BENEFIT THAT IS REQUIRED BY STATE ACTION THAT TAKES PLACE AFTER JANUARY ONE THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE OTHER THAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IS CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO THE H. B. I WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO DEFRAY THE COST OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR THE CONSUMERS SO ALTHOUGH COVER CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT ARE ENROLLED ON EXCHANGE MAY HAVE THIS NEW MANDATE. ACOSTA WE WOULD NEED TO FURTHER ANALYZE HOW THIS MAY IMPACT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN OUR OFFICE CHANGE PRODUCT AND WHETHER THEY WOULD NEED TO ABSORB THAT ADDITIONAL COST THEMSELVES SO AS WE KNOW AFFORDABILITY IS CRITICAL FOR ALL CONSUMERS AND OUR EXPERIENCE TO SHOW THAT THE CONSUMER ARE PRICE SENSITIVE AND THERE'S A LOT OF HEALTH CARE. IN ANY INCREASE TO DEMANDS WILL AFFECT JUST AND CHOI. STATES NEED TO BE MY OF HOW MANDATE YOU BEEN A- IN. PREMIUMS THE RULES TO HAVE SOME. IN WHICH ARE WITH STATE PENSION PLAN. SO WHAT A DEFINED ARE RAILS MUST ONE OF THREE. TO CHANGE CURRENT. PLAN THE FIRST OPTION IS SELECT ANOTHER STATE H. B. BEEN PLAN THAT WAS YOU DURING THE TWO. SO PLAY YEAR. THIS OPTION IS TO SELECT A CAT. OR MOST CAT. OF THE H. FUHRMAN SO SPEND PLAN. THE THIRD IS TO SELECT THE- TO BECOME THE STATE BENCH MY PLAN. SO STATE'S WERE TO DECIDE TO. THE BENCH MY PLAN A NEW SELECT BENEFITS BASED ON A- AT THE THREE ARE. THAT I MENTIONED MUST HAVE AN ACTUAL CERTIFICATION. THAT AFFIRMS THAT THE STATE'S HE H. B. BENCHMARK PLANS EQUAL IN SCOPE OF BENEFITS. PROVIDED UNDER A TWO EMPLOYER LAN AND ALSO IN ACTUAR. PORT AFFIRM THAT THE NEW EACH BENCH MORE. DOES NOT PROVIDE BENEFITS CENTER SO GENEROUS THAT IT VIOLATES THE ACA. SO FOR EW EACH BE BENCHMARK PLAN TO BE AFFECTED BY THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PLAN YEAR THE STATE MUST NOTIFY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF THE SELECTION OF A NEW EACH BE BENCHMARK PLANNED. BY MAY EIGHTH OF TWENTY TWENTY HOWEVER HHS HAS ALL RECOMMENDED THAT STATE MATT THIS INFORMATION BEAR SO THAT. PROVIDE REVIEW AND GUIDANCE BEFORE THE MAY EIGHTH SUBMISSION. P. H. P. AND- TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SERVICE THERE MAY BE AN AND- TO PREMIUM. WHICH IN TURN MAY I IN. THE PREMIUM TECH CREDIT AND THE. SO IN SOME THE H. B. VENTURE AND BENEFITS SIZES STANDARDIZED IS TO COVER CAL CONSUMERS AND HAS HELPED COVER CAL DESIGN HEALTH COVERAGE FOR MORE THAN TWO MILLION CONSUMERS AND ROLLED ON AND OFF THE EXCHANGE. THIS WOULD REMAIN MINDFUL THAT THE ADDITION OF ANY NEW STATE MANDATES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT TO THE PREMIUMS FOR WHICH OFFICE CHANGER RELEASE MAY BE TAKEN EARLY SENSITIVE TO. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPACT VERY DEPENDING BENEFITS THAT IS IT'S AN. DATE THE NEW MANDATE. CVH BE WITH RESULT IN STATE'S TO DO A- COSTS. UNDER THE FED RULES TO STICK BE RE TO DO THE- IN FOR. EVEN IN THE OF THAT THE STATE LATER INCORPORATED BENEFITS IN STATE PENSION PLAN. THERE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO THE MANDATE OF ANY NEW BENEFITS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL COST IMPACT. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TURN. FIFTEEN GOOD. THANKS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS KEREN CORBETT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM KNOWN AS TO BURKE- TO PURPOSES TABLETS BY THE LEGISLATURE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO YESTERDAY I CELEBRATED MY TENTH YEAR ANNIVERSARY WHICH BURKE I DON'T KNOW WHERE TIME IS GOING. W ALL WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL CLEARLY WHEN THE- INTEREST WAS UP THESE. THE MANY YEARS AGO AT HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS MANDATE BILLS AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED ANNOUNCES SELECT YOUR- THE OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN. TO DECISION MAKING ON. HELP INSURE TOP. BY PROVIDING OBJECTIVE ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS ANALYSIS WE PRODUCED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ANALYSIS A PROPOSED LEGISLATION ADDRESSING A WIDE VARIETY OF BENEFIT COVERAGE TOPICS. SELECT THE BENEFITS TO COVER IN A AMONG ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS REFLECTS UNDERLYING TENSIONS THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AS BOTH OF YOU OF COURSE NOW IS NOT STATIC IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFITS IN OVERTIME. IN THIS OF COURSE BUMPS UP WITH THE CHALLENGE OF KEEPING HEALTH INSURANCE AFFORDABLE WHETHER IT BE AT THE ST PAUL MAKING LEVEL AND OR VISUAL. WHOSE CONCERT PERCHED ENSURE. AT ALL TO AT A POLICY LEVEL WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE TO COMPETING GOALS PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH NEEDS IN KEEPING AN OF THE BOWL SO THAT PEOPLE AND OR PLAN SPONSORS TEAM THAT. WILL ENSURE CARP. ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ARE FLOOR AS WE'VE HAVE WITH THIS. AND ARE RELEVANT BENEFITING FLOORS INCLUDE HEALTH SERVICE THIS VERY LONG STANDING OF LAW AND REGULATION APPLICABLE TO HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS REGULATED BY DIEM SEE ALSO PUT APPLICABLE TO SEE THE HAS INDIVIDUAL GROUP MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY PREVENTIVE OF FEDERAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES MANDATES ARE ALSO AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FLOOR. YOUR BURKE ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL INTERPLAY BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS BENEFIT FLOORS AND STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES FOR EACH ANALYSIS WE UNDERTAKE. AS YOU'LL FIND IN THAT LARGE TABLE IN YOUR PACKETS THERE ARE DOZENS OF EXISTING STATE MANDATES AND A NUMBER OF FEDERAL ONCE WE CREATE AND MAINTAIN THIS RESOURCE FOR CALIFORNIA AN UPDATED AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IT IS WORTH UNDERSCORING THE FACT THAT EACH BEES DIRECTLY AFFECT THEHEALTH INSURANCE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF CALIFORNIANS. EXEMPTS FROM H. B. REMAINS OUR LARGE GROUP HEALTH PLAN SELF INSURED A RED PLANWHICH ARE FEDERALLY REGULAR. AND ARREST THE GOVERNOR MULTIPLAYER WELL ARRANGEMENTS NOT OBJECT STATE INSURANCE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS REQUESTED THAT YOUR INCLUDE WHETHER IS LIKELY TO EXCEED EACH WITHIN EACH TREE BURKE REPORT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THIS DISCUSSION OF MY REMAINING COUPLE MINUTES. BECAUSE FEDERAL STATE REGULATIONS ARE CLEAR AS TO WHO WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION. CHIPPER QUERIES BOTH STATE REGULATORS MADE SEE AN CITY I AND REPORTS THEIR CONCLUSIONS AND WE APPLY OUR OWN KNOWLEDGEABLE LAYPERSON ALTHOUGH I WAS STRESSED NOT LEAK INTERPRETATION. FIRST DAY BENEFIT MANDATE TO EXTEND THE DEFINITION OF THE H. B. AS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS TRUE BIRDS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FOLLOWING MUST BE TRUE. THE STATE BENEFIT MANDATE IS NOT COVERED IN THE KAISER SMALL GROUP HMO BENCHMARK PLAN THAT HELPS TO FIND THE CURRENT EACH BE PACKAGE. THE STATE BENEFIT AND IT WOULD BY THE PLANS AND POLICIES SOLD COVERED CALIFORNIA. THE STATE BENEFIT MANDATE IS NOT COVERED UNDER BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES AS REQUIRED BY KNOCKS KEEN. AND THAT THE STATE BENEFIT MANDATE IS SPECIFIC TO CARE TREATMENT AND OR SERVICES MEETING THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF A BENEFIT MANDATE THAT COULD EXCEED THE H. BEES SHOULD STRESS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS. E. G. REQUIRING A CERTAIN KIND OF PROVIDER GET REIMBURSEMENT FROM EXISTING SERVICE OR TREATMENT OR PROCEDURE OR I'VE REQUIREMENT ON A HEALTH PLAN OR A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT THESE THINGS DO NOT INTERACT WITH EACH BE DETERMINATIONS. SO AN EXAMPLE BOB LAST YEAR OF THE BILL. FIVE NINETY EIGHT. IT'S WHICH STRIPPER BUT STE THIS WOULD REQUIRED SEE REGULATED PLAN SINCE THE IRISH POWER. TO PROVIDE COVERAGE HEARING AID FOR CHIU HERE TO SEVENTY. LOCALLY FUNDED INCLUDING CAL AND CAL MAY CARE. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO KNOX KEEN. CHIPPER WOULD HAVE H. B. WHY THIS PURPOSE INSURED BENEFIT NOT IN CALIFORNIA'S PLAN AS THE COMMITTEE MAY OUTLINED THE FEDERAL DEFINITION A STATE BENEFIT MANDATE THAT CAN EXCEED EACH BEES IS SPECIFIC TO THE CARE TREATMENT SERVICE. IT RECALL ISSUE IS TO OFFER TO ITS RELEASE. YOUR BIRD AS THAT THE TOW STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT FIRST YEAR COULD HAVE BEEN BETWEEN TWO POINT ONE AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION. SO ON BEHALF OF CHIPPER- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO CONTINUE TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THE COMEDIAN OTHERS WERE INTERESTED AND INVOLVED IN THESE KINDS OF ISSUES WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRIESTS AND RESOURCE. AVAILABLE ON OR- FOR ANY TO ACCESS. TO A COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS- IF THAT'S TO THIS YEAR. THE D. ON SURE WELL ACTUALLY I WAS FIRST GO TO BOB HERTZBERG. AS SOMEONE RAMOS AND. MAYES FOR JOINING US TODAY AND SO. QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS. ALL RIGHT WELL CHAIR WITH OKAY MY POP MY APOLOGIES SO. IT OBVIOUSLY WE EIGHT WERE UNDER CHAU AMEND PRESSURE TIMES TO YOU KNOW AT TO ADD BENEFITS TO PLANTS. ESERVER IS A KNOW THIS IS A- IT'S A OPINION AND AN AND I KNOW THAT'S ALSO BROUGHT WITH HAZARD ASKING YOU MAKE IT UP BUT- IN A FROM YOU PERSPECTIVE WHAT. CURRENT OF THIS HELP IS A STAKE IS THAT STILL THE TEST OF. KIND OF OPEN QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TREMENDOUS SO- TO CHANGE OR ADD TO THING SO I'LL I'LL WALK INTO THAT FIRE- AT LEAST SET FROM THE FRIENDLY BACK AWAY. EARLY ON YOU KNOW THERE WAS A THE ACE AND- THE FORMER CARE ACT INITIALLY ENVISIONED SORT OF A DIFFERENT PROCESS ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPECIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND THERE WAS A- LONG. AND ROBUST- EFFORT BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE TO ADVISE SECRETARY OF HHS ABOUT THIS SORT OF INTERNAL PROCESS OF. CONSIDERING YOU KNOW BOTH THE REQUIRE IN THE ACA BUT EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF WHAT THAT ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS LIST SHOULD BE OVER TIME. NOW I I'M ACTUALLY CITED SCHUBERT'S APPROACH SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA AS ONE APPROACH THAT COULD INFORM ON GOING- CONSIDERATIONS AROUND ESSENTIAL BENEFITS. THE A BOMBER ADMINISTRATION SORT OF TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONSTERNATION FROM NUMBER BATES ABOUT CA AND WE SORT OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION I JUST THOUGHT THAT HISTORY IS SORT OF WORTH NOTING THAT. IT WAS A DO IN THE THIS WAS. WEEKLY STATIC. IN THAT. IT'S ABOUT SO MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TO ELABORATE ON THAT WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS THAT- I THINK WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES USING BROAD CATEGORIES IS THAT- IT THE SERVER IS THE CHOIR TO UP BY PLANTS BECAUSE IT DOES EVEN ALL OVER TIME AND SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TH AND SORT OF DRAWBACKS OF BEING VERY PRESCRIPTIVE WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN STACK. THAT I. DIFFICULT ARE COVERED. IN IT CAN IT CAN SOMETIMES BACKFIRE BECAUSE AS MEDICINE IS ALWAYS MOVING FORWARD RIGHT AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS MOVE WITH THOSE AND FOR THE MOST PLANT PART THE HEALTH PLANS ARE GENERALLY OUT WITHOUT. BEING I THINK. ABOUT IT IT HAS. THE BROAD CATEGORIES THE DEATH THE- AND COVERED SERVICE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN THAT WAY. HE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES- BECAUSE I THOUGHT AS I THE ONE OF THE COMMENTS I HEARD WAS THAT- ONCE IS WE EXPLORE A CHANGES IN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WE HAVE DAY HEAR SOMEONE SAY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES WOULD MEAN AND DRAW FROM THAT OR DID I SENATE STAND. THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE TO BUT A STATE CAN AND LOOK TO. WHAT AND SHE HANDED IT FOR AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PACKAGE FROM ANOTHER STATE IS NOT REQUIRED IT IS NOT REQUIRED OKAY OKAY AND THEN I DID I DID MISS HERE MISS HERE THAT SO. THE OFF EXCHANGE PLANS SO OBVIOUS AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A TWIST THAT I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IS WE START THINKING ABOUT CHANGES- BECAUSE- WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL BE PRICEY WITH. PRICE SENSITIVE FOR THAT THOSE OFF EXCHANGE. OKAY DATE TYPICALLY HAVE THE SAME THEY HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS AS THE COVER CALIFORNIA PLANS. YES SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE NON GRANDFATHERED SO AND SO IN THE WHICH IS MOSTLY SMALL GROUP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME SMALL GROUPS THAT MIGHT BE GRANDFATHERED SO DAY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE REQUIREMENT TO COVER EACH BEES. THEY STILL HAVE THE BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES REQUIREMENT AB AND BUT YES SO OFF EXCHANGE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKET YOU'LL HAVE BEEN REPAIRED PRODUCTS AND THEY HAVE. EXACTLY THE SAME BETTER THE EXACT SAME COP. AND THE OU WILL BE TERM TURNOUT BENEFIT DESIGNS AT THE- MORE SO ON THE SMALL GROUP MARKET AT HALF COVERED. IN NOTHING BUT COST SHARE STRUCTURE. WE DIFFER FROM WHAT. STATE AND THE PERSON THINK OF COURSE. EXT AS FIRST OFFICE CHANGED THIS. IS ROUGHLY. WELL IT'S KIND OF HARD DISK BECAUSE I IT WILL REALLY DEPEND ON AND ROLL MEN'S AND THERE MIGHT BE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE PRODUCT DESIGNS OFFERED OFF EXCHANGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS ALTERNATE BENEFIT DESIGN YOU HAVE MERE PLUS ALTERNATE OFF CHANGE DO YOU HAVE. MORE MORE QUESTIONS PUT OFFICE GAINES BUT THE IN ROMAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS MUCH HIGHER ON THE EXCHANGE OFF EXCHANGE OKAY SMALL GROUP I THINK IS STILL SLIGHTLY MORE OFF EXCHANGE OKAY HIGHER MOMENT YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO I WANT ACTUALLY DOVE IN A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE ISSUE OF- THAT YOU RAISE THAT IF YOU HAVE A- YOU KNOW A MANDATE. THAT IT CAN BACKFIRE- THE SO. AND SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE MANDATES THAT WE'VE PASSED BOTH PRE AND POST A CLL KNOWS ME POST CA- BUT- SO WILL ACTUALLY MONTHS I'M A PEDIATRICIAN- WE- I WORKED WITH MY PREDECESSOR THAT TEMAS AND ASSEMBLY- STAR SIGN BURKE- WE MANDATED COVERAGE FOR. AUTISM SERVICES RIGHT- TO HEALTH PLANS IN THE REASON THAT INVOLVED WAS BECAUSE- ESSENTIALLY- NO IT FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP AND THEY SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT HE GETS THROUGH THE SCHOOL. I WOULD SHOULD OFTEN YES AND WE FAMILIES WERE STUCK WITH SCHOOLS ONE THOUGH TO HEALTH CARE THING AND THE- YOUR SAID IT'S A SCHOOL THING ARE. THE SO- AND SO BECAUSE ID A THE SCHOOL HAS TO TAKE CARE OF IT SO WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND- I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE THEN IS THAT- SO WELL FIRST OF ALL CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. IT WAS PASSED SEVERAL MANDATES THE SAMPLE HOW ANY SPECIFIC DEAL WITH JUST ONE OF THE MANDATES WHERE THIS MIGHT IT BACKFIRED- WHERE- A SPECIFIC END DATE BECAUSE TUESDAY FIX THEN OUT TO. BLESS YOU KNOW OF PEOPLE NOW PATIENTS HAVING AN ABILITY AT THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO YOU BROUGHT THAT UP AS AN ISSUE I'M NOT SAYING I DISAGREE WITH THAT NECESSARILY BUT- IT'S I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A- FORCED TO. PICK ONE AND GIVE US AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS MIGHT HAPPEN. WELL I THINK- I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SO I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE CAME UP. TWO YEARS BACK HAVING TO DO WITH D. MAMMOGRAPHY AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS COVERED. BECAUSE MAMMOGRAMS WERE COVERED- BUT DID THREE D. MAMMOGRAPHY SO I THINK REALLY THE- WHAT IS I DON'T KNOW THAT IT SO MUCH BACKFIRED AS MUCH AS HAVING THE REQUIREMENT TO COVER BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS. CAN SOMETIMES BE RELIED ON BECAUSE OF THE BROAD SCOPE BECAUSE MAYBE THAT THE MANDATE IS SOMEWHAT- NEED. IN THE WAY THAT IT'S HER MIGHT NOT COVER ADVANCEMENT SO. IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MAYBE WE- END UP WITH SOMETHING NOT BEING COVERED SO MUCH AS THAT FACT THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OF BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THAT LARGER CATEGORY SORT OF AND SERVES AS A BACKSTOPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD WANT SOMETHING THAT AS SITES MOVE FORWARD IN IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THAT PATIENT THAT THAT WOULD BE COVERED. I CAN'T THINK OF ANY SPECIFIC IS GET UP OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OR SOMETHING CHRISLEY WANTING CAUGHT. SO I MEAN THAT THAT EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLES ACTUALLY HE'S COVERED PERSPECTIVE KNOWLEDGE YEAH A TECHNOLOGY THAT REALLY NAY THAT MAY BE YOU THIS. LEE AT THE OVER NINE MAY I. THERE'S OTHER TECHNIQUES STAFF NOW A SUBSEQUENT SIX THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS THAT'S YEAH ALL RIGHT SO AND I KNOW OTHER I THAT THAT DON'T THINK IT HAPPENED HERE CAL. FOR PEER TO TIME DOES SOME HOPE THAT TOTAL BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS WOULD BE A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER AND SO DOES A LOT OF TERROR IN THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE THE PROPER PROCEDURE TO TURN IT DOWN AS EXPERIMENTAL TO REQUIRE THAT. OVER TIME IT'S COVERED IT WAS UP TO GO IF IT MEANT. VALUE HAPPENED. THE WAY INSTEAD IN CERTAIN. THAT THAT WAS COVERED SO I DIRECT A SOMETHING'S WHEN YOU SPECIFY IT TO A PARTICULAR FORM OF TECHNOLOGY VERSUS A- THAT THAT. THERE'S A CHALLENGE THERE BUT- BUT I GUESS SO FOR EXAMPLE GOING BACK TO THE AST EXAMPLE. AND IT'S COMES DOWN TO WELL OKAY SEE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE BROAD CATEGORIES RIGT AND I GET THINGS ARE DYNAMIC. THIS THE TERMINATION THEN DOES IT FIT INTO THAT BROAD CATEGORY OR NOT RIGHT SO LET'S JUST TAKE OUR A ES DE. DOESN'T BECOME. AS EIGHTY EXAMPLE- YEAH DATE IF SOMEONE GOES AND SAYS WELL MY CHILD HAS A DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITION AND NEEDS TREATMENT AND WENT AND- SO BUT IS SO IN WENT THROUGH YOUR EMAIL DISCREETLY AND WHAT'S THE VIEW PROCESS WHICH WHICH I KNOW WILL YOU TRY TO MAKE IT SIMPLE BUT FRANKLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BE MET. THE HOOPS EVEN WE TRY TO MAKE. THE AND BARRIERS HOW DO YOU THE CASE IN QUESTION IS YOU SAID YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN WHO MAY HEALTH MAKES THESE DETERMINATIONS FOR THESE APPEALS HOW WHAT GUILIN'S YOU PROVIDE THAT TO THE SIDE YOU KNOW IS IT. YOU KNOW WITHIN THE BROAD CATEGORY OR NOT. FOR THE TERMS OF THE MEDICAL NECESSITY PIECE OKAY OKAY OKAY SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND ADDRESS KING SO- I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE MAT THE SUBSIDY DETERMINATION THAT'S DONE BY INDEPENDENT CLINICIAN OKAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GIVING GUIDELINES TO PHYSICIANS ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD DETERMINE MEDICAL NECESSITY ARE NOT THAT THE JUDGEMENT OF THAT SO THERE'S NO GUIDELINES RIGHT AYE AYE YEAH I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING- THEN. DOWN TO THE AST THING PRIOR TO ACTUALLY PASSING THE LAW THEN HOW WAS THAT DECISION THEN HOW IS THAT. BUT CAME TO THE A. B. C. AND SAID WELL. YOU KNOW MIGHT BE SO HOW ABOUT A HOUSE WE DECIDED WITHIN THE BROAD CATEGORY THAT ASD TREATMENTS- WE'RE SENSUALLY NOT CONSIDERED TO BE COVERED SHOULD BE COVERED BY HEALTH CARE SO I MEAN YOU CAN ARE YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A BACK CATEGORY THAT COULD I MEAN IT'S AN INTERPRETATION ISSUE THAT. SO WHAT POINT THE DECISION FALL TOWARD. AT WHICH THEN NECESSITATED I GUESS WE CAN ARGUE WHETHER NECESSITY BUT ESSENTIALLY RESULTED IN A BILL AND MANDATE TO NOW COVER IT BECAUSE THE DECISION ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THAT NO IT WASN'T. BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY WHAT PLANS CONSTANTLY TOLD THE PATIENTS OKAY THAT OKAY SO THOUSAND FEET SO BASICALLY WE HAVE BROAD CATEGORIES AND I TRY TO FOR YOU TO HAVE A SPECIFIC STATUTE LIKE THE ONE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TO. BE H. T. YEAH THAT. TRYING TO GIVE BECAUSE- AGAIN YOU THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BY WHY GET BILLS. GAIL DIFFERENT REASONS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS BUT I MEAN THAT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY ETCETERA BUT IT IS. AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE SAID WELL LOOK YOU KNOW WE THINK. PEOPLE ARE GETTING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THE HEALTH PLANS CONSTANTLY TELL US THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR IT IT'S YOU KNOW AND- OFTENTIMES EXCUSE. GO GET IT FROM THE SCHOOL. BY WHICH WE PAY FOR VITAL BILL. AND SO THAT'S WHY THE VENT THAT COMMUNITY CAME TO US AND WE WANT INSURANCE MANDATE EVERY TIME TURN AROUND AND SELL. THE THEN IS THAT PART OF IT WHY DID THEY END UP. TURNING TO LEGISLATURE IS BECAUSE- UNDER THE LAW BROAD CATEGORIES THAT EXISTED THEN. RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAD THIS BROAD CATEGORIES. SOMEHOW IT DETERMINATION WAS MADE BY SOMEONE. AT THE IDEA OF THE PLANS THEMSELVES CERTAINLY DECIDE OLD THAT HAITIANS BUT ALSO I GUESS. THE REGULATOR YEUTTER SAID WELL WE KIND OF GO ALONG WITH THE PLANS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T YOUR GOING AROUND OVER TELLING TRANSCEND AND I KNOW THAT'S WRONG SO HOW DO WE DECIDED THAT WAS NOT. BE INCLUDED IN. THIS IN THIS. HER DEATH. OF BASIC HEALTH SERVICES SO I. THAT FOR EACH SITUATION IT MIGHT DIFFER I THINK IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU'RE GIVEN. THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER SINCE I THINK HISTORICAL CONTEXT IT MAY BE PART OF IT THAT. THERE WAS A THERE WAS A THOUGHT AT THE TIME- THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD BE COVERING AND- AND CLEARLY THE THINKING ON THIS AND COVERAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE P. H. TO LOOK PAST HAS. FALL RIGHT AND I. AND STATE MENTAL HEALTH. AND FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE FOCUS- ON COVERAGE OF THESE THINGS SO I THINK OF THAT. THERE WAS. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THOUGHT TO BE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE MAYBE TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARSAGO AND SO SOMETIMES THESE THINGS EVOLVE ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA O MENTAL HEALTH AND SO I THINK THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT AT THAT TIME THE LEGISLATURE OFFICE. TO ANSWER THE- AND DEFENDED SAY THIS IS A HEALTH CARE SO AND IT WILL A VERY. RANGE OF SERVICES THAT DIDN'T MAYBE AS NEATLY FALL INTO SOME OF THE CAT. THAT ARE USED TO DESCRIBE BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES I WAS SO LIKE YOU KNOW IT IT. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REALLY AT THE CONSERVATIVE IT'S BEING PROVIDED BY YOU KNOW A PARA PROFESSIONAL IN THE HOME SO I THINK IT GOT MAYBE IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT IT WAS SOMEONE IN MARTIN'S AT THE TIME I AM AND WHAT NOT AS CLEAR. AS LIKE YOU KNOW FIXING A BOWL EARLY RIGHT AND SO- SO I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER FOR YOU AS TO YOU KNOW WHY THERE WAS A SPECIFIC REASON WHY THAT SPECIFIC PROVISION WAS- WAS PASSED BUT I THINK THAT- I THINK THAT SOMETIMES. THE THINKING AND- THE EVOLVING OF WHAT SHOULD BE COVERED- HAPPENS AND THEN THERE'S CATIONS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE STEPS IN AND SAYS. YOU KNOW THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT HEALTH PLAN SHOULD BE COVERED AND THAT'S BAD EXAMPLE OKAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE I'M PICKING ON YOU SPECIFICALLY BUT SINCE YOU'RE TO A TOPIC BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I THINK THIS REFLECTS ON THE TENT SO INTENTIONS BECAUSE AS YOU EXPRESS IN YOUR ANSWER. AND THAT. IS THAT WELL WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW AND THERE IS AGAIN TREMENDOUS PRESSURE. FROM PEOPLE ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GET ACCESS THE SERVICES WE THINK IT SHOULD BE FROM. PLANS THAT YOU SAID WHAT WE KIND OF LOOK HISTORICALLY THAT SOMETHING WE NORMALLY COVERED RIGHT. BUT SAME TIME WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT WELL. MANDATE CNO WE ALSO WILL FALL OFF RIGHT TO NOT BE INVOLVED. OF ALL. MORE SO MORE MAYBE INVOLVING. AND SO NOW THE TENSION AYE. THE OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE RESOLVES THIS RIGHT SO. WE HAVE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS YOU KNOW ACA WOULD LEAD THE STATE LAW ALL RIGHT WE SELECTED OURSELVES ABOUT IT AND JUST AND JUST TO BE SURE I GOT IT RIGHT- MISSED FILES ARE NO OKAY SO IT HAS TO BE IN THE STATE BENCHMARK PLAN AT THE TIME OF. JERRY FIRST TWENTY TWELVE RIGHT SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE BIT THE BENCHMARK PLAN CHANGE THERE. THE OUTSIDE TO ADD SOMETHING SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THAT STILL DOESN'T COUNT RATE BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BE AT THE TIME OF THAT YEAR AND I CORRECT. RIGHT THE BENEFIT HAD TO BE IN PLACE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FOURTEEN NOT EXCEED THE GENEROSITY IS THE STATE BENCHMARK PLAN YET RIGHT SO EVEN IF KAISER WENT BACK AND SAID WE DECIDE ADDED DIFFERENT COVERAGE THINGS. ON THEIR OWN TO THE BENCHMARK PLAN THAT WOULD NOT THAT THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE BENCHMARK IS FIX THAT. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY ELEVEN I GUESS RIGHT. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT NOW WE GOT STRUGGLE WITH. HISTORY WE LACK THE PARTICULAR DATE DOWN. AND THINGS ARE EVOLVING STILL TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES EVEN SOCIETY HELP OFFICE RIGHT AND SO WHEN BIG THINGS THAT CONTINUES TO BE TALKED ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH PARITY IN WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY SUPPOSED TO MEAN AND I THINK THEY'RE MADE. I THINK THERE'S SOME MORE EVEN LEGISLATION ABOUT. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I REALIZE WERE SIR TIED LITTLE BIT TO THE LAWS. IN A BID TO LOSS TO AND WHAT THEY'RE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BE WILLING TO PAY FOR WHICH THEN BECOMES WHAT'S THE STATE WILLING TO PAY FOR. THE FEDS ARE PAYING FOR- ARE YOU SEE IS NAVIGATING THE FACT THAT WE ALSO HAVE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OF ALL OF THEM BECAUSE- THIS IT IS WHAT. EXPECTATIONS AND TING HE HAS INVOLVED IN THE- MEDICINE AND RELATED AND HEALTH CARE HAS EVOLVED. AT HOW HOW DO WE TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OF. WELL BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME WERE SORT OF LOCKED IN LEGISLATIVELY AND ACTUALLY SO I GUESS THE OTHER INTERESTING QUESTION IS RELATED TO THAT. WOULD BE IS THAT. SO THE BENCHMARK PLAN HOUSE SPECIFIC IS THIS- BECAUSE WE A BROAD REQUIREMENTS SO I MEAN IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE BENCHMARK PLAN WOULD HAVE OR NOT HAVE COVERED THAT IN ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY. A LOT OF AND IS THE IT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S GONNA LOOK BACK TO AND SAY WELL THAT'S- SAID THAT IT'S THAT INTERPRETATION EVEN IF SOMEONE SAYS IN THE FUTURE WE INTERPRET A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY YES IT'S WHATEVER WAS IN PLACE F. WITH A STATE BENCH MY PLANET OFFERED. BY DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND ANY STATE. MANDATED THAT WAS IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS IN THAT BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT WAS ALREADY IN PLACE SO CALIFORNIA HAS MORE. I WOULD SAY THE- OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT MAYBE SOME OTHER STATES WITH- BUT IS THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE CUT OFF DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST THOMAS NAY LEVIN SO. IF THERE'S NEW STATE MANDATED BENEFITS THAT'S WHEN IT'S TAKEN ME TO. THE CAR AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. SO IN OTHER OPTIONS OBVIOUSLY. THE FEDERAL PROVIDE THAT MORE. VILLAGE. SOMETHING COULD BARELY INTO BUT BEING VERY MY OF THE OBVIOUSLY ANY IN TO SERVICE WELL USUAL INCREASE THE PREMIUMS RIGHT AND SO THAT WILL THAT WILL HAVE IMPACT TO OUR CONSUMERS AS WELL TO- AS FAR AS THIS FEDERAL SUBSIDIES WILL PROBABLY GO UP AS WELL AS THE STATE SUBSIDIES BUT FOR SURE IT WILL IMPACT POTENTIALLY ARE OFF EXCHANGE MEMBERS WHICH WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY. THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MORE THAN THE OFF EXCHANGE MARKET RIGHT NOW THAT POTENTIALLY WOULD NEED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GETTING THE YOU KNOW. FOR THE IT WILL INCREASE THE PREMIUM FOR THEM WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO SEND WITH REGARD TO YOUR SPECIFICALLY. THE BENCH PLAN THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE HAS SOME SPECIFIC LISTS IN IT FOR EXAMPLE THE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT PROVIDES REYES SPECIFICALLY LISTED. AND THAT CONSTRAINS WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE CENTRAL HEALTH BENEFIT FOR THAT IS. FOR EVERYONE. OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THE I THINK WE'LL GO SOME OF THE TENSION ALSO IS THAT. I YES IF YOU. ADDED BENEFIT MOST LIKELY THE BAND THEY SERVE ASSET BUT USUALLY THEY THAT. EIGHT INCREASED. THE PLAN AT THIS SAME TIME. THE REASON YOU BUY A PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT RIGHT AND HAPPY OF THE PENNY HOW WE WANT TO FIND THAT BUT- IN A SUPPORT WE STRUCK YOU KNOW THAT CERTAINLY I STRUGGLED WITH WITH THE WITH THE A SOME MULLIN SPILL OVER THE HEARING AIDS RIGHT WHICH- TO. SUPPORT BECAUSE BECAUSE GET YELLED BUT THE NATURE OF THE BENEFIT WILL IS ONE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THAT WAS IS THAT AND REASONABLE EXPECTATION EXPECT THE HEALTH AND THE COVER RIGHT I MEAN HEARING IS PRETTY. NOW BEYOND THAT HERE'S THE HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT OUR LATIN ABILITY HERE- YOU KNOW- I CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON YOUR ABILITY TO. TO FUNCTION IN AND MY FAMILY SOME PEOPLE WHO'VE WHO FEEL HAVE HAD THAT CONDITION- LIFE AND IT'S YOU KNOW BEEN EDUCATE AND TRAIN MAY BE ABLE THAT BUT NOW IT'S STILL HELLO HEARING LOSSES. AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT POINT IN A DIFFERENT WAY ON GENERALLY IT IS AT THE ACT AS THOUGH RIGHT I MEAN IT'S NOT. THE POWER BUT STILL WE ARE HOW HOW HOW HOW DO WE DO WITH THE A GAPS AND THEN UP THOUGH IF THERE MAY BE NEED GAPS OVER TO. WRITE SO THE WE GO ON TO. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT. WITH TECHNOLOGY MOVING AT AT AND SO FORTH- THAT YES MAYBE FOR YOUR YOUR VAST MAJORITY P. WE GOT. EVERYTHING COVERED BUT IF THE GAPS ARE LARGER AND LARGER I MEAN IF THE PRESSURE WE FEEL THAT THE PRESS THAT WE WITH WHAT. WHY NOT COME WITH MANDATE BILL RATE AS SOMEONE'S IN WRITING. AND THERE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT YEAH. FEDERAL RULES OUT. SCRIBE BUT TODAY DO NOT SO MUCH PROVIDE. A WITH. TO THE- AS PROVIDE. PERILS TO THIS. YOU COME UP WITH. A WITH WEEKS WHICH IS DESCRIBED TO PASS ONE IS TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT BENCHMARK PLAN. BUT THE FEDERAL RULES THAT PERMIT THAT. IN THIS CYCLE- THE PLAN SELECTION WOULD HAVE TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BY MAY EIGHTH OF THIS YEAR JUST VERY SHORT TIME PERIOD. AND THEN THE SELECTED PLAN WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPLY WITH WHAT WAS CALLED THE GENEROSITY REQUIREMENT IN THAT IT CANNOT BE MORE GENEROUS IN TERMS OF ACTUARIAL VALUE THE PERCENTAGE OF. VALUE NEVER TO THE POT XIN THAT IT COVERS- CANNOT BE MORE GENEROUS THAN A PANEL OF COMPARATIVE PLANS SO BASICALLY IF YOU. KNOW IF YOU HAVE A CHEVY NOW YOU. ABLE TO GET THE CASH. BECAUSE THIS GENEROSA OR- IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WISH TO PURSUE A- UP. TO DEVELOPING A NEW STATE MANDATE FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC- JUST RECENTLY IN A PROPOSED FEDERAL RULE ISSUED THE NOTICE OF BENEFIT PAYMENT PARAMETERS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING. HAS NOT YET MADE FINAL THE STATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MANDATE SAID IT HAS AND DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE. OVER THE PAST YEAR OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE STATE'S HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN ABLE TO SELF POLICE AND SELF EVALUATE WHERE THEY'RE A NEW MANDATE IS SUCH THAT IT REQUIRES AT THE STATE. DEFRAY THE COSTS. NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED IF THIS RULE IS MADE FINAL. TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WATER MANDATES ARE WHAT ARE EVALUATION IS AND- THE PROPOSED RULE IS REPLETE WITH THE INTENTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE INCREASED OVERSIGHT. OF THE- AND THE CHARACTERIZATION PROCESS SO I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT NATIONALLY AMONGST THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS THERE'S GREATCONCERN. THAT THE STATE'S DETERMINATION THAT A NEW MANDATE DOES NOT REQUIRED TO FOR A BILL MAY BE CHALLENGED NOW BY THIS BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THIS REQUIREMENT SO TWO PATHS TO PERILS. DAD I MEAN AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT NO WELL WE SEE THIS FREQUENTLY IS THAT WHAT I WANT TO GET THE CSTS. IT'S CENTER- BUT I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT WE JUST WANT THINK ABOUT IS THAT HOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS EVOLUTION OVER TIME BUILDING I DO JUST WANT TO QUICKLY CORRECT MYSELF- IS ACTUALLY EIGHTY FIVE NINETY PLAY IS SIMILAR BLOOM. AND THAT MULLIN ALTHOUGH I AND I WANT RECOGNIZE SOMETHING MULLIN FOR HIS HIS WORK BECAUSE HE ALSO HAS DONE TREMENDOUS WORK AROUND HEARING LOSS AS WELL BUT IT IS SO BLOOM AND I NEED TO SURE HE GETS THE CREDIT FOR DOING BILL THAT HE AUTHORED. AROUND SO IT. ON THE RIGHT. MY FEET. PARKS TERMS THAT BILL BUT HEY I'M JED. THINK OF. AND I. YOU REGULATE. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IMPLEMENT THESE THE LAWS THAT HE- BOTH THOSE PASSED BY US AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT NAVIGATE THE FEDERAL LAWS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO. DO AS WELL TO STOP. THE WOOD WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE YOU KNOW- PRESSURE FROM PEOPLE WHO WILL POINT OUT WITH THE WITH MANY OF THEM WITH GOOD REASON- THEY ALSO THE THAT- THERE'S A GAP IN THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE- BALANCE. IT OUT WHAT WOULD. WHAT TO AND MAYBE SOME BE TELLING THEM LIKE WILL YOU NEED TO HELP US LOBBY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TREAT GIVE US SOME FLUID NELSON MECHANISM. TO TRY TO DECIDE AS TIME GOES ON YOU KNOW HOW WE DID A FIGHT GAPS HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS IN A WAY- THAT- THAT IS SURE IS THAT OLD GET. COVERAGE A NEED BUT BALANCE IS OFTEN I DO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN. IS THAT GOING. WITH OF THAT EVERYTHING ON THAT WILL AT CAL. BUT MAYBE THE CHEVY IS MISSING SOMETHING. LIKE YA SIDE VIEW MIRROR MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT SIDE YOU MAY. HATE IT ALL OF AB DOESN'T BILL ENOUGH THAT AB L. MADE CAR WILL STILL DRIVE WITHOUT IT BUT IT'S A LITTLE SAFER. SO FORTH NOT SOME PSYCHO WE AYE CADILLAC ARRAYED IN THROUGH A REAR SPOILER THAT WE REALLY DON'T HE DRAPES SO. AND IT COURSE THAT'S ALL THERE'S JUDGMENT ABOVE AND ACTUALLY WHAT KNOW HOW WHAT WHAT WHAT BUT- I IT'S- TRIED IT NO I THINK. WE WANT. TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. ABOUT THAT I KNOW CHIU VERY TIME IN IN THE BILL COME OUT. TO HELP US OUT WITH. THIS WELL. THE OTHER KOREAN IN A CHIPPER ONLY FOR DOING AT BILL I MEAN. DE SEIR INTO HELP US TRY TO MAYBE ADDRESS THIS ON A LARGER ISSUE- IN TERMS OF- I MEAN. I GUESS ONE INTERESTING QUESTION WOULD BE IS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN ESTIMATES PER MANDATE AND I'M A PAST AND SOME HAVEN'T. ONE TO FIND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW EACH ONE SEEMS LIKE- IT'S ONLY YOU KNOW IT'S A DOLLAR A YEAR IT'S FIFTY CENTS A YEAR IT'S THAT ARE BUT THEN WE START. AT ADDING THEM UP AS WELL AS THERE. ARE SOME SENSE OF CUMULATIVE IMPACT AS WELL AS YOUR BIRDS LOOK THAT- WE HAVE AND I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THE TO BURKE WORKED WITH MIL MEN IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE VARIOUS BENCHMARK OPTIONS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND. EIGHTEEN AND- BRUCE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE STATE BUDGET TO STICK WITH THE EXISTING KAISER HMO PLAN BUT YOU KNOW WE DID LOOK AT OKAY WELL WHAT ARE THESE OTHER TESTS OUTSIDE OF THAT AND I MEAN IN A SOAP. CERTAINLY LOOKING BACKWARDS DIFFICULT TO THEN FIGURE OUT WILL WHAT IS COUNTERFACTUAL WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IN REGULAR MEDICINE AND PLANS WITH A COVERED ANYWAY OR WHAT WAS DUE TO THE TO THE MANDATE SO. A LOT OF THESE A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES ARE REALLY DIFFICULT AND GIVE YOU A RANGE THAT KIND OF MAKES YOU OKAY THAT VERIFIES COMMONSENSE. BUT IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE ON THAT'S MY HESITATION ONE. POLICY WANT ME LOVE THAT IDEA THAT WOULD BE MY IDEA OF A VACATION- THE ACCURATE. KING TO TRY TO GIVE THAT IS A CLEAR ROADMAP TO THE FUTURE ISN'T THAT. ACCURATE OKAY BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THERE IS A PLACE OF BEING ABLE TO PROJECT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY PART OF THE BENCHMARK LIKE INFERTILITY OR CHIROPRACTIC PEDIATRIC CARRONADES CERTAINLY DOING I'LL SIT ON THAT YOU KNOW PREFERABLY WITH MAYBE MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS BUT- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE COULD SUPPORT. YEAH I MEAN AS FAR IS THAT THE- WELL MAYBE DIFFICULT THERE'S ALSO MAYBE SOME VALUE SAYING WHAT WE PROJECTED THIS IN THIS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE WORK YOU KNOW THAT THE SIMI THAT. THAT THE MANDATE HAD YELLED. AND THE PLACE I REALIZE. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ADD TO ANY NEW ONES RIGHT NOW. BUT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. RIGHT QUESTIONS AND IF I GUESS IS PLEASE ANY KNOW BEAR MY- A LOT OF- A LOT OF THE TENSIONS. HOW IN THE SINKING SO AS PRACTICE OF. BECAUSE A LOT OF. WE HAVE A COUPLE PRACTICE CHANGE R OTHER YOU KNOW TAKING ON AND PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES SOMETIMES AT. LOWER COST OR PARA PROFESSIONALS ARE ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SO AS IS THE POLLUTION OCCURS COVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DON'T. TO RUB UP AGAINST EACH FEES SO THERE IS. AS WE SAID BUT I THINK OF THESE TONIC PLATE. OF HEALTH CARE. IS ALLOWANCE FOR THIS EVOLUTION OCCUR THAT DON'T BUMP UP WITH THE- YEAH I MEAN THAT WHEN. THAT PERHAPS SAID BIGGIES. IS THAT- WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF BETTER TECHNIQUES FOR EXAMPLE CATHER'S ASIAN CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. MUCH TO THIS MAY I THINK OF THE CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEONS REMOVED FROM BY PASSES TO KAT YELLED VARIOUS CATHETER TECHNIQUES FOR STENSON OTHER TYPES OF THINGS- AND THAT ALL HAPPENED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF. THE EXISTING- BASIC HEALTH BENEFITS RIGHT BUT THOSE WERE THAT WAS IT THAT'S A PRETTY BIG SHIFT. AND INCLUDING CUT COSTS AND SO FORTH SO. AND I'M SURE THERE'S MANY OTHERS WE CAN POINT TO APPRECIATE THAT OBSERVATION. OUR EIGHT. RIGHT WELL THAT I WANT YOU THANK ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS THIS IS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF WHAT HAPPENED IS WE IF THERE ARE MANDATE- CHANGES- AND ALSO WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT- THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR- WAS THEM THAT AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT- WHAT THE WHAT YOU FACES A REGULATORS AS WELL AS OUR VALUE EIGHT PERCENT. AND WILL YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK. FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPRECIATIVE OF THAT IS SO THEY YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- FROM HERE TODAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. YEAH OKAY WELL NEXT UP IS- THE PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR HEALTH INSURANCE CARRIERS AND CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE SO HEARD FROM THE REGULATORS NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE- PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES. THE PLANS TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO. SELL THE COVERAGE IN IMPLEMENTED AND THE CONSUMERS WHO ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. OKAY AND PAY THE PREMIUMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO OF MAYBE JUST A QUICKLY DO INTRODUCTIONS HERE FIRST AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD THE START WITH THAT MR LOUISA SO ACTUALLY WHAT WE HAVE AND INCLUDES A VICE PRESIDENT OF WHAT'S THE AFFAIRS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS DIANA DOUGLAS BOXING LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FROM HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA AND A JONES WERE BLOOM- CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION AND VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH COLLABORATIVE WELCOME ALL- MISTER LEWIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIR- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- DISCUSS OUR VIEWS RELATING TO THE IMPACT OF STATE BENEFIT MANDATES ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH COVERAGE AND- AGAIN MY NAME IS NICK LOUISE US ON THE VICE PRESIDENT LEGISLATORS PER CAPITA CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION PLANS A- LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH ABOUT TO TALK STATE MANY. CAN PROCESS BY WHICH. TO FIVE OUT. YOU KNOW MOVING. THE BUT KNOW AS AS DOES DOES YOUR AS A TRADE ASSOCIATION THE REPRESENTS FORTY A KNOCK LICENSE HEALTHTHAT DELIVER HELL CARE TO SIX K. ON INCLUDING THE ELEVEN MILLION BENEFICIARIES THAT RECEIVE COVERAGE OF THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM- HEALTH PLANS ARE DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE. AS YOU WANT CALIFORNIA INSURANCE MARKET IS CHANGE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND REMEMBER PLANS HAVE BEEN CLOSE PARTNERS FOR THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT VARIOUS KEY MARKET REFORM. BY SEVERAL MEASURES I CAN LEADS THE WAY WITH ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO CLOSE THE UNINSURED GAP AND- WE LOOK FOR TO MAKING MORE STRIDES THIS YEAR HOME ON THAT ISSUE- CALIFORNIANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PAY LESS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE- ON AVERAGE- THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IN ACCORDANCE COVERAGE. FOR NEEDS POOL OF CUSTOMERS OR ITS RISK POOL- HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN HEALTHIER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AS WELL. AND THE REASON FOR THIS SUCCESS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION- HAVE ME DECISION SOMETIME DIFFICULT DECISIONS ON THAT HAVE LED TO MARKET STABILITY- EXAMPLES OF THIS- INCLUDE THE EARLY EARLY IN RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE ADOPTION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- IN CALIFORNIA. I'M IN ONE CRIME A RECENT EXAMPLE- IZZY ENACTMENT OF A STATE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THIS REQUIREMENT COUPLED WITH STATES CITIES. IS ALREADY RESULTING IN SOME OF DEVELOPMENTS. MOST NOTABLY THE PRODUCTS SO IT COVERED CALIFORNIA TWENTY TWENTY ARE EXPERIENCING AN AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE OF A LITTLE LESS THAN 1% AND I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY NOTEWORTHY ACHIEVEMENT- IN JUST YESTERDAY AS AS A SUMMER WOULD MENTION TO COVER CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCED ITS HIGHEST ENROLLMENT NUMBERS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND A 40% INCREASE- OVER LAST YEAR'S FIGURES SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS AS WELL ON ANOTHER KEY REASON FOR CALIFORNIA WELL TO MARKET STABILITY- WHICH A LOOSE LITTLE BIT LATER IS THAT OUR STATE IS DECIDEDLY IN HISTORICALLY MANAGED IN ITS MARKET ORIENTATION- WITH THE GOAL DELIVERY RIGHT- THERE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN USING EVIDENCE ADDRESS IT I'M TO. POLICIES SO WE BOUGHT THE STATE FOX TOUGH TO SEE ON LEAD TO THE BOLTS THAT CAPITAL SIR CAN TO SO. ALL THESE IS BLAZING MARKETS AND THE- POLICY AT LEAST AGREE FOR THE NOW REGRETTABLY YOU KNOW FOR OUR FIRST ONE ON COVERAGE MANDATE. RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AFFORDABILITY ON IN IN THEIR TOTALITY WE FEAR WILL UNDERMINE A MANY OF THESE SUCCESSES THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED. ON CAP GENERALLY A THIS IS ALL MANDATE BILLS BECAUSE THEY DRIVE UP HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES. ON EMPLOYERS- SOME MANDATES INCREASE THE COST OF CARE INCREMENTALLY. OTHER MANDATE BILLS INCREASE THE COST EXPONENTIALLY- EITHER WAY OUR CONCERN HAS BEEN THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT MANDATES ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF. LAST YEAR CAL LEDGE CAN. FROM ABOUT NINE OR TEN NEW BENEFIT MANDATES BILLS THAT AS PROPOSED WOULD HAVE DRIVEN UP DRIVEN UP THE COST OF HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS BY MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLAR A PREMIUM IMPACT- AS A RESULT OF- THE PACKAGE OF MANDY BILLS LAST YEAR INTESTACY CONTRADICTORY. ANNUALLY PASS THIS MANY BILLS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE PREMIUMS WENT LAWMAKERS HEALTH PLANS AND OTHERS ARE TRYING TO. ACHIEVE AFFORDABILITY- I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE- THAT- YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS DO NOT OPPOSE THE UNDERLYING SERVICES. ON THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN MAN BILLS AND YOU KNOW- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE ARE SOMETIMES VERY SENSITIVE- IN SYMPATHETIC ISSUES I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL MADE OUT OF THE SAME STUFF SO IT'S- IT'S HARD SOMETIMES GET UP IN OPPOSE THESE BILLS. BUT YOU KNOW WE STRONGLY BELIEVE POINTING OUT THE NEGATIVE AFFORDABILITY IMPACT- WE FEEL IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROCESS- MANDY BILLS ARE GONNA I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT MANY BILLS OF KIND OF EVOLVED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- IN ADDITION TO THE BILLS THAT ARE ST. COVERAGE MANDATE REQUIREMENTS OFFER BENEFITS- MANY MANY BILLS THESE DAYS ARE NECESSARILY REQUIRE COVERAGE FOR EXISTING BENEFITS BUT CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY ARE COVERED- AND SO IN OUR VIEW MOST OF THESE BILLS- YOU KNOW WE'LL WOULD UNRAVEL THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF OUR MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. INCREASE VOLUME BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE QUALITY OF SERVICES. OF THE IDEA BEHIND MANY OF THE BILL'S INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY IS THAT MORE. AND MORE SERVICES IN DRUGS INTO HIS SHOULD BE PUMPED OUT WAS ZERO CONSIDERATION OF AFFORDABILITY. OF THE UNDERLYING COSTS OF THE SERVICES OR WHETHER THEY ARE EVEN RECOMMENDED- BY THE EVIDENCE. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY VIS BUT SOMETIMES- SUPPORTED- FOR THE PETITION THERE'S OF CARE PREMIUM TALLER AND VARIOUS DRUG MANDATE THAT YOU IN THE PAST IN IN. THIS YEAR. I'M MIND AND APART IS JUST POINTING. HILL STREET A POINT ABOUT YOU KNOW THE- ON. YOU KNOW IT AB BASEMENT ANGELA THE RIGHT AT THE RIGHT TIME V. COMMITTEES UNDER PRIOR LEADER. ON CAMPUS ACTUALLY ONE HEARD IN. A COUPLE OF. THAT WOULD HAVE REMOVED HEALTH PLAN UTILIZATION PROTOCOLS ON PAIN MEDICATION. IN OTHER WORDS IF THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED A PAIN PILL IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY COVERED BY THE HEALTH PLAN- AND SO YOU KNOW. ABOUT THE PROPOSED POLICY THROUGH THE HISTORY. EPIDEMIC CAN YOU. THAT I IN YOU KNOW THE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND RETRO AND SO NEED TO TAKE A LONG PURSE NOT ONLY A NEW COVERAGE MANDATES BUT MAN EXISTING COVERAGE INTO THE WAY THINGS ARE CO. HELLO TERM WRIST WE- YOU'VE- WOULD HELPFUL THAT DEPARTMENT. SO IN ADDITION TO COST AMONG THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS- IN OUR ANALYSIS OF MANDY BILLS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. YOU KNOW IT DOES A BILL IRRESPONSIBLY REMOVE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS ON DRUGS AND OTHER SERVICES. THE BILL INCLUDE A POLICY CHANGE THREATENS THE MANAGED CARE MODEL OR EXPOSE HEALTH PLANS TO LIABILITY. DOES THE BILL ERRONEOUSLY APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE BILL THE CAR MY POINT IN TIME. THAT ARE NOT BASED ON INDEPENDENT REVIEW EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE BUT THAT SITE SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS BY NAME. AT INHIBIT THE INABILITY OF PLANTS TO ADAPT TO INNOVATION OR NEW INFORMATION AS AS DISCUSSED PRIOR IN THIS HEARING. SHIFTING GEARS A LITTLE WILSON WAS POINT OUT THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND SMALL GROUP MARKET DID NOT SET THE- EACH BEATTY'S WHICH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED EARLIER- YOU KNOW. LATER IN THE EVENING. BENCHMARK PLANNING C. H. BEES- IN YOU AGAIN YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS ABOUT THAT PROCESS IT WAS A LOGICAL PROCESS. THAT INCLUDED RIGOROUS ANALYSIS. COMPARISONS IN TRADE OFFS- BETWEEN THE NEED FOR BENEFITS AND AFFORDABILITY. ON IN THE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE SET OF BENEFITS WAS WAS SELECTED FOR CALIFORNIANS IN THOSE MARKETS- AND- YOU. SIMPLY IT STANDS FOR REASON HOWEVER THAT EVERYTHING- CAN BE LOOTED. OUT AND IN THAT PROCESS. AND YOU THE FOR ALL YOU'RE DOING ONE OF THE BENEFIT MANDATES ON HIS RELATED CONCEPT IN THAT COULD EXPOSE STATE GENERAL. TO FIT. HE REPLACED GATED AYE I MADE A MINISTRY DID MINISTRATION STIPULATE THAT THE FOR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR THE COVERAGE SO. TO SUPPORT BENEFIT. MANDATES THAT EXCEED THE H. B. AS IN THE STATE WILL HAVE TO DEFRAY THAT COSTS WHICH THE EXPERTS PRIOR TO ME EXPLAINED IN BETTER DETAIL BUT THESE RULES MIGHT BE GETTING TIGHTER THERE ARE PROPOSED FEDERAL RULES TABLE THAT WOULD REQUIRE. TO HAND WILL BE IDENTIFIED. BEEN SAID EXCEED THE H. P. OR PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR STATE MANDATED BENEFITS STATE BELIEVES DOES NOT EXCEED THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. AND SO STATE DID IN ITS STATES DON'T COMPLY WITH THIS A PROPOSED RULE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL THROUGH THE LOOK MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IS SO. MANY MORE HE- PROPOSITION THE STATE A POTENTIAL. IN THE COMING MONTHS YEARS. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE JUST A WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS ON MORE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE FEEL IS MORE LOGICAL AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER MANDATE BILLS MOVING FORWARD- FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE GIVING THIS ISSUE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. AND WE APPLAUD THE CHAIRS FOR DELIVERING YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE TO MEMBERS THAT YOU KNOW THESE BILLS ARE ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA SO- WE THANK YOU FOR THAT THE WORK THAT DAY TRIPPER IS ALSO VERY COOL. AND WE APPRECIATE MANY BILLS ARE OFTEN GIVEN A SPEC HEARING DATE ASIDE. ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE. SO BUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON YOU KNOW PROCEDURAL PROCESS OF MANDATE BILLS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. NUMBER ONE- WE DO RECOMMEND THAT- THE STATE CONSIDER RE OPENING THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS QUESTION AND CONVENTION PLAN CONSIDERATION. ON AND SELECTING A NEW PLAN OR AT LEAST LOOK INTO THAT- THIS OFFICE IS KIND OF SCARY RECOMMENDATION- AS PLANS MAY NOT SUPPORT THE FINAL SELECTION FROM AFFORDABILITY OR ACCESS PERSPECTIVE- BUT IT'S AT LEAST A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS AN ANALYTICAL THAT FORCES US TO CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS INVOLVED- IN QUITE FRANKLY ANYTHING. JEKYLL IS DOUBLE THE SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS IN COMMITTEE MEETING WHAT MAN BILL. UP I'M. NUMBER TWO WE WERE RECOMMEND FROM LEGISLATURE PROCESS PUTTING MNDY BILLS ON A TO YOUR BILL CYCLE- AND YOU KNOW ALL EXPLAIN THE REASONING FOR THIS- WILL NUMBER ONE IT'S BEEN DONE FROM BEFORE THERE'S PRESS AND FOR THAT- IN THE WE FEEL THAT IT'S BEEN. AN OFFICIAL TO THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS- INTO HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES. IT WILL ALLOW TROOPER MORE TIME HE WAS WORK ON THE CHIU BOURBON NOW SEES ARE OFTENTIMES DELIVERED RIGHT BEFORE AN INS. DECK THIS IS THROUGH THE BILLS HAVE BEEN HURTING COMMITTEE- AND THIS RUG RUSH PROCESS- IS FOR TALK TO ALL PARTIES ALT WE SO THINK GIVING HER MORE TIME ALLOWS STATE. TO AT THE END OUT AND PROVIDE BACKING IT IS NOT AN- FOR. THE ISSUE PARTS. SEASON SITUATIONS. THE ARE THE PRE YOU PORCHER WE HAVE A- HE IS WAY FOR BERMAN COULD HAVE BEEN COST ABOUT WHAT IS CURRENTLY CO WHAT EXCEEDS ESSENTIAL BENEFITS WHAT THE MEDI LITERATURE SAYS ABOUT A PART ISSUE OR WHAT THIS BILL LEE IS AND ITS IMPACT. A TWO YEAR CYCLES THERE'S A COMMITTEES THE OPTION OF REQUIRING TO BURKE TO ESTIMATE THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT. OF ALL THE MANDATE THAT HAVE BEEN INNER TO USE WHICH IS A SOMETHING I WAS APPROACHED EARLIER- WE TRY TO DO A CUMULATIVE IMPACT BY ADDING ALL THEPREMIUM INCREASES ESTIMATED BY TIMBER. BUT WE KNOW THAT THE SIMPLE MATH MATH MATH IT IS UNSCIENTIFIC- AND SO THERE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RIGOR AROUND THAT DOES. REQUIRE TIME- YOU KNOW OTHER IDEAS WE HAD WAS YOU KNOW REQUIRING THE PLANS TO REPORT THE PREMIUM IMPACTS OF ANNIE'S RESISTING. WE DON'T USUALLY REPORT CARMEN'S ON A BUT IN. COULD BE IN. CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER CITY TIONS. WE'LL BE THERE ANY NEW MATT EXCEEDS THE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS SHOULD HAVE A CORRESPONDING LINE ITEM APPROPRIATE IN. IN THE BUDGET TO. COVER THE TRAIL REQUIREMENTS. SO AND AGAIN YOU KNOW. TO TELL YOU TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE THE I. ARE YOU INCLUDING MANAGE IN A SPECIAL OF BUSINESS YOU KNOW DURING YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED HEARINGS- THE IS. SOMEWHAT TEDIOUS I GUESS BUT ALSO KIND OF EMPHASIZES THE TOTALITY OF THESE- PREMIUM IMPACTS SO CLOSING AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL THAT WHEN WE COLLECTIVELY FOCUS ON MARKET STABILIZATION AND ON THE UNDERLYING DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS WE GET GOOD OUTCOMES. AND IT'S AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DO NOT FIT THAT AGENDA. AND THERE ARE OTHER LOGICAL WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUE THAT WE HOPE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THE SURPLUS. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR PAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOARD THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE A PART OF TODAY'S HEARING AND DIANA DOUGLAS POLICY ADVOCATE WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS HEALTH ACCESS TO TOP QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS QUALITY BENEFITS MEANS THE GUARANTEE THAT CUSTOMERS GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE EARLIER THAN I CAN ACT AS REQUIRED COVERAGE OF BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCLUDING DOCTOR VISITS HOSPITALIZATIONS IMAGING LABORATORY IN OTHER SIX SERVICES HOWEVER PRIOR TO THE FORMAL CARE ACT INSURANCE UNDER THE A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OVERSIGHT WERE A LIMITED BENEFIT. INCLUDING THOSE THAT MAY ONLY OF COVERED IF YOU DIE. AS ONLY A FEW DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION OR ONLY GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN ITS REQUIREMENT THAT SMALL GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLANS COVER TEN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WE GAINED MUCH NEEDED ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIANS UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WITH LARGER GROUP COVERAGE REGULATED UNDER INSURANCE CODE STILL LACK MANY OF THOSE PROTECTIONS. IN FACT THE ACA ITSELF WAS ABLE TO PASS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER JUNK HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT LACKS MANY KEY OFFICE. LEADING UP TO THE LANDMARK LEGISLATION WERE PROLIFERATION OF CONSUMER STORIES HIGHLIGHTING THE REAL HUMAN COST. OF GROSSLY IN AT AN OPEN MID. USING COVERAGE. WHAT FORTY CONSUMER SUSAN BREAK ABOUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE. SHE ONLY FOUND OUT AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER THAT IN FACT MANY OF HER TREATMENT OPTIONS MOST OF OUR TREATMENTS WERE NOT COVERED. THE OUTPATIENT LUMPECTOMY THE CHEMO THE DRUG SHE NEEDED. THE RADIATION WERE NOT COVERED UNDER THE PLAN SHE HAD PURCHASED THE EASY THANKFULLY PUT AN END TO THOSE SORT OF SUB STANDARD PLANS THAT LEFT PATIENTS IN A LARGER WORSE- IN A IN A POST A CA WORLD THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO REEVALUATE BENEFIT MANDATES BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EVOLVING CIENCE AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH CARE. AS BENEFIT MANDATES OUR VALUE ADDED IS ALSO NECESSARY TO BALANCE THE GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH ALONG WITH THE NEED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE AND FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR PATIENTS THAT COMES WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE- HEALTH ACCESS AS A CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WHO FOUGHT FOCUS IS NOT ONLY A QUALITY OF CARE BUT ALSO. AFFORDABILITY AND IN MANY INSTANCES WE TAKE THE LEAD ON ADVOCATING FOR CONSUMER AFFORDABILITY- IT WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BALANCE. THE AFFORDABILITY WITH THE GOALS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND COVERED BENEFITS. OUR ORGANIZATION DOES NOT SUPPORT EVERY BENEFIT MANDATE THAT THAT COMES ALONG AND WE VIEW SOME. ITH THE SKEPTICISM AB PARTICULARLY I WOULD NOTE THAT WAS SPONSORED BY- IT MAYBE A SPECIFIC DRUG OR DEVICE MANUFACTURER FOR THAT HAVE A- SORT. OF FOCUS IN THIS REGARD. I'M AT THE SAME TIME WE THAT PROPOSE MANDATES RESULT IN VERY MINOR ADDITIONAL COST AS FAR AS PREMIUMS GO SOMETIMES PENNIES ON THE PREMIUM AND GIVEN THAT THE USED TO BE LIMITED BUT THE COST SPREAD ACROSS ALL ENROLLEES THAT'S THE POINT OF INSURANCE OF ANY OF THESE MANDATES THAT WE TALK ABOUT WELL THEY WOULD INCREASE COSTS IT'S VERY RELATIVE TO. THE GAMES THAT GOT FOR PATIENTS. WITH ASIAN TIMBER FROM THE BEGIN AND EVER ITS ROLE IN DETAILING THE IMPACT OF THESE MANDATES- NOT ONLY THE COST BUT ALSO THE BENEFITS THAT WE SEE THEM. TO THE CONSUMERS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN A BROADER SENSE- AFFORDABILITY IS ALSO CRUCIAL GOAL SO CONSUMERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD COVERAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE- WITH ANY PREMIUMS THAT ARE MANAGEABLE AND ALSO COST SHARING THE FORM OF COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. THAT AREN'T SO BURDENSOME THEY WILL PROVIDE FOLKS SEEKING OUT THE COVERAGE THAT THEY NEED FOR THE CARE THEY NEED- BUT DENYING THE TERROR OR RESEARCHING WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. THAT IN OUR OPINION AN APPROPRIATE MEANS OF KEEPING COSTS DOWN WE'RE PLEASED THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAKING MANY OTHER APPS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY- PRTICULARLY RECENTLY BY PROVIDING CHANNELS. AND COVER ALL OF. AND ALSO TAKING SMART POLLUTION GET ON MY- UP CARE SO PER THE NEW. A OFFICE OF HER HEALTH CARE FOR WE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE APPROACHES HAVE A BETTER ABILITY TO GET TO WHAT'S UNDERLYING THAT THE RISING COSTS. WE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO THE PRE AC LANDSCAPE OF FEWER IF ANY ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS WERE LOWER COST CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE'S LIVES DIGNITY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY CALIFORNIANS SHOULD EXPECT ESSENTIAL BENEFITS TO BE COVERED AS A BASELINE AND NOTABLY FOR THOSE TWO EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS AS WE HEARD EARLIER AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AS OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MORE IS CHANGE. THESE THESE BASELINE BENEFIT. AN EVOLVING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SUCH BASICS AS CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS LIFESAVING PAP SMEARS AND MAMMOGRAMS WERE NOT COVERED. WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE COVERED. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WERE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED OPTIONAL BENEFIT SO YOU SEE IN THESE OF ALL OVER TIME. AND WOULD EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. WITHOUT DEBATING THE MERITS OF SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR PARTICULAR BENEFITS CONSUMER ADVOCATES STRONGLY SUPPORT OF ALL BEING ESSENTIAL BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGING SACKED SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. AND ALSO THE NEED TO KEEP PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING AFFORDABLE ALL WORKING ULTIMATELY ENSURE PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS CARE AND FINANCIAL SECURITY THAT THEY EXPECT FROM HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THANK YOU. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS JOE MORE BLUNT AND I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COLLABORATIVE OF WHICH I AM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD AND ALSO THE CHRONIC ARE THEY I'M SORRY CALIFORNIA HEALTH COLLABORATIVE WHICH I'M ALSO VICE CHAIR OF THAT BOARD. SENATOR PAN AS THE MEN WOULD I WOULD VERY MUCH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION. THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IS AN ALLIANCE OF NONPROFIT. AND PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS UNITED TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH THE CONDITIONS CAN ACCESS APPROPRIATE QUALITY. HEALTH CARE. WE ENCOURAGE PREVENTION WE ENCOURAGE EFFECTIVE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE POLICIES. A CENTRAL BENEFITS OF HAD A DIRECT IMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA PATIENT ACCESS. TO QUALITY CARE AND THE LIVES OF MILLIONS CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE WITH CHRONIC IS. IT'S ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE ADEQUATE COVERAGE THAT ENABLES HEALTH CARE ACCESS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH. AN AT RISK FOR COMPLEX CHRONIC DISEASES WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE TOOLS. IN THE NECESSARY TO MANAGE THEIR CHRONIC CONDITIONS THESE TEND TO SCALE BACK THEY WILL FOREGO CARE. THEY WILL SKIP MEDICINES THEY'LL CUT THEIR PILLS IN HALF YOU'VE HEARD ALL OF THESE STORIES BEFORE I KNOW THESE OFTEN LEAD COMPLICATED AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS WHICH TEND TO BE EXPENSIVE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF CARE. AND THESE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS CAN VERY OFTEN BE. I WAS HIS NURSE SPECIALIST FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THE MEDICATION THE BASIC EQUIPMENT FOR THAT ONE DISEASE LET ALONE. THE COMPLICATIONS THAT COME WITH IT. THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION AND ITS ADVOCATES HAVE WORKED WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES TO IN THESE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE. MUCH OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY WORK FOCUS ON LEGISLATION THAT SUCCESSFULLY IN SOME CASES ADDED MANDATES AND CREATED LEGISLATION FOR THE APARTMENT OF INSURANCE WE WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING THE TO. MANAGED HEALTH. HAITIAN ADVOCATES. MANDATE WE FOUGHT FOR TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHOSE HEALTH PLAN DENIED THEM ACCESS TO CARE THEY WERE CONSIDERED ONLY AFTER PEOPLE PRESENTED WITH TWO MILES FOR THE SPECIAL CARE EITHER CAUSING HARM UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND TREATMENT CONDITION WORSEN OR AGAIN X. TO THE EMERGENCY. CALIFORNIA. COLLUDED AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT DROP THESE EXISTING BENEFITS DUE TO BUDGETARY PRESSURES ESSENTIAL HAVE YOUR BENEFITS FOLLOW THE KNOX KEEN ACT CONSIDERATE PROTECTION. PROVIDERS PLANS. THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT IT IS THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PROMOTE DELIVERY AND CAUGHT HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CASE FOR YOU I CARE COULD LOSE COLD. FOR PATIENTS TAX MY DATE WORKABLE HEALTHCARE THROUGHOUT THE CARE CAN YOU TAKE. IN OUR RESEARCH INDEPENDENT NICOLE PORT WHICH WE RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE ANALYZE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WEBSITE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DENIALS WHICH WAS ALARMING TO US. WERE FOR THE NOVELS FOR KEEP POPPING. PROCEDURES MEDICATIONS REIMBURSEMENT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS BEHIND ALL OF THESE TO NILES OUR DATA EXPLORED A SAMPLE AND YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE REPORT. ARE FINDING ANY PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASES AND CONDITIONS ARE DENIED pREQUEST WHICH RIVER- FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF THEIR CONDITIONS WE WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT NOW. ONE PEOPLE WERE DENIED AND THE REASON FOR THE DENIALS. WE INVESTIGATED TRENDS OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE INTERRUPTION OF ACCESS TO TIMELY HEALTHCARE. EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON A PER SINCE. TWO NEW THE CARE. IF ALL OF THE MANDATE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE. IS A FACT OF WIND THEN WE ASKED WERE OVER 61% OF THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS SUBSEQUENTLY OVERTURNED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. AND FOUND THAT WAS AN ALARMING SITUATION STATISTIC THE CHRONIC HERE COALITION IS INVOLVED WITH MANY SHAREHOLDER WORK GROUPS COMMITTED TO FINDING ANSWERS. THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DEPENDENT UPON MANDATES OR LEGISLATION WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION MAKING HEALTHCARE WORK FOR EVERY IS A TOP PRIORITY. WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PATIENT AT THE TABLE AND IN THESE DISCUSSIONS I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU QUESTION. FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR THE IN THE INFORMATION FOR AN ANSWER IT IS DIVERSE AND VALUABLE- FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES- I'M AND I'M CURIOUS CURIOUS MISTER RESOURCE YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT TO AND MAYBE AT SOME POINT WE GOT BACK. THEN THE DISCUSSION- THAT IS THAT IS I'M NOT SURE WE COULD GET EVERYTHING BACK IN THE CAN IF WE DO THAT BUT BUT I'M- BUT I BUT I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE AS- WE SEE PRESSURES. DEVELOPING WITHIN HAVE THE END WITH THE LEGISLATURE- I THEY KIND OF THESE BE THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THE SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS- BUT TO SORT OF KEEP THE PRESSURE OFF OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE HAS THIS IS COME ALONG. THE A REALLY LOADED. WELL YEAH I MEAN I KNEW WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT I WOULD GET A HARD QUESTION SO- THAT I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO. YOU KNOW I'D THAT I'D- I THINK A PERIODIC REVIEWS IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION YOUR POSITION ON THAT BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TO BE I YOU KNOW THE CONCEPTS THAT WE BROUGHT UP EARLIER AROUND. IN AS A KID AND CHANGES IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD WANT A PRODUCT TO BE IN PLACE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS IN ORDER TO. CONSISTENT ON IN TO SEE- YOU KNOW HOW IT'S IMPACTING THE OVERALL COST OF CARE- AND- YOU KNOW DIDN'T DO SOME MEASUREMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE HAD CONSIDERED I THINK WE WERE POOR OFFERING IT AND IS A IN THE MORNING BUDGET CALLED. THEN WHEN THE WAR OFF BILLION YOU KNOW UNTIL IT IS EVERY YEAR. WHAT IS I WAS I WOULD SAY JUST IN IN GENERAL IT'S IT IS A CHALLENGE I THINK AS- IT WITH INSURANCE IN GENERAL- PEOPLE HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT. THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETELY COVERED- ME SEE FOR EXAMPLE- WHILE IT'S NOT THIS ISN'T. THIS ISN'T A INSURANCE COMMITTEE BRING- I THINK OF WILDFIRES IN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY HAD COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN THINGS IN DID NOT. BUT THEY WERE RICH. AND CENTER WERE NOT. THIS I. TWENTY AROUND HEALTH CARE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS- THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE COVERAGE FOR THAT AND I THINK WHEN THEY FIND THAT THERE ARE COVERAGE THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S- THAT'S WHERE. THAT'S WHERE THE- AND SO. PROCESS LOOK AT THE PANEL OFF TO BE ADEQUATE AT RESPOND TO BE NEED AND A CHECK WORLD IS SOMETHING WE WOULD YOU KNOW I WOULD BE OPEN TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY LOOKS LIKE BUT- IT IT IS CHALLENGING THROUGHOUT INSURANCE WHETHER YOU KNOW HE CAN. INSURANCE HOME BUT WHATEVER OUR I THINK PEOPLE PATIENT WHAT IT SHOULD BE FOR WHAT THEY'RE PAYING IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT IT IT REALLY PANS OUT TO BE A TALKING TO CEMENT IN ABOUT THE FACT WASN'T TOO MANY. DROP BY. COVERED WITH WITH MEDICARE AND SO ON SO THESE ARE THESE ARE THESE ARE CHALLENGING ISSUS SO THANK YOU. THIS THE ANNOYED THAT THANK YOU- FOR EVERYONE THE PANEL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS SITES WILL BE CLEAR YOU SAID THE SUGGESTION THAT WE LOOK AT THE IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR STORY OF PERSONALLY OR THAT. I CAP DECISION. I MEAN WE WOULD. I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A PER A BOWL- APPROACH TO AND- CONSIDERING WHAT SHOULD BE COVERED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAN THE CURRENT METHOD OF JUST THROWING MANDATES INTO THE HOPPER- INTO YOU KNOW. QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW THE- IT'S A IT'S A TIME CONSUMING ISSUE YOU KNOW FOR BOTH THE COMMITTEES AND FOR US I MEAN WE ARE MORE- YOU KNOW EXISTENTIALISM BROAD IN A BROADER YOU KNOW- HEALTH CARE RELATED ISSUES THAT WOULD RATHER BE DISCUSSING AND SO. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A PROCESS AVAILABLE TO THE STATE IT'S IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A BIT. ANALYTICAL LOGICAL. RUN RECESSION THAT CONSIDERS A TRADE OFFS IS PREFERABLE TO THE PRESIDENT THAN THE EXISTING PROCESS SO- JUST YOU KNOW FRAME MY RECOMMENDATION YOU KNOW IN THOSE TERMS. AND A PRECIADO THAT IN A AND STANDARD TAT I MEAN I THINK THE THING IS HOW DO WE HOW WE LOOK AT THIS IS ENTIRE SYSTEM. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONE. MALL I GUESS. ONE THING. YOU GET THE JOB. OF IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE FIVE CENTS OR SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW FIFTY CENTS OR AND DO YOU THINK WELL THAT'S NOT. THE SELLER TO BIG DO YOU WANT. SEC AND- LOOK. WHAT IT IT'S AN ODDBALL ONE WITH. WHOLE THING. THE ABOUT OKAY WELL THIS IS GOING TO TAKE. IF TAKE THE PLAN A COVERS ALL STUFF THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE THIS MUCH WE PICK THE PLAN. SO AND IS THE IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE ONE TO RATE THAT. AND SO FORTH WHAT THE BACK AND- IT'S MORE SUS. SYSTEMIC CONVERSATION AND I GUESS. I ASSUME THAT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT WOULD BE IS THAT. IF WE WERE DOING THIS WE WOULD ALSO THEN PEOPLE LIKE WILL ACTUALLY DO YOU BRING ALL YOUR STUFF OUT THE- CARD. PATIENT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE. TAUGHT ABOUT. VISUAL OFFS WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS ANY THIS IS. NOT IN UNCOMMON NINE IN INSURANCE I MISS ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE PEOPLE WANT. THINGS IN THE CURRICULA RIGHTON. DO WE DO THIS TOGETHER ARE. EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE HAS ITS OWN MERITS BUT YOU KNOW THEN WE START PILING ON AND THE TEACHERS ARE LIKE OKAY WHAT'S IN OUR TEXT BOOKS WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO COVERED IS AT ALL CONNECT TOGETHER AND SO FORTH AND- SO FORTH SO. NOT A COMMON THEME IN GOVERNMENT I. GOVERNANCE BUT LET ME KNOW ON THAT FIRST THE SAME QUESTION PERHAPS SAID IT IS A LITTLE LOOK BACK HISTORICALLY- BUT AYE OPPOSED TO REGULATORS YOU KNOW AN AREA THAT'S NEAR DEAR TO MY HEART. THE ISSUE ROUND AUTISM COVERAGE IS NOW LAW RIGHT AND SO FORTH BUT- BUT CLEARLY DOES IT THE NATION BEFORE- THAT AT LEAST PLAN SAID PRETTY MUCH SAID WE'RE NOT YEAH WE LIST FALLS INTO THE BROAD. IT CETERA. HOW TO DEAL WITH THE THINGS MOVING FOR INTO THE FUTURE WHERE WE THIS TEN OUT. OKAY WELL KNOW PEOPLE FEEL IT'S A DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITION THEIR ORDER OUT DIED SUPPOSED TO SOME SERVICES WOULD BE L. COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE COVERED THROUGH IDA THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT SAME TIME PEOPLE FEEL. I MEAN THE TREATMENT SHOULDN'T JUST BE AT SCHOOLS SO- MAYBE REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON- TRAFFIC WITH THE YOU WERE BACK THERE FOR SOME OF THESE DATA YEAH THIS DISCUSSION NINE DOES I YOU KNOW I DIDN'T STAFF THAT BUILD RIGHT I REMEMBER SOME OF THE DEBATE AND- YEAH I WAS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED MEAN VIEW THE OTHER PARTY THAT WAS INVOLVES REGIONAL CENTERS. RIGHT YOU KNOW INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE THEY WERE LEGALLY OBLIGATED PROVIDE SOME OF THE SERVER OUT OF A BE PLAN MAY. SO PART OF UP. VIEW THAT AS A- THEFT FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER TO PREMIUM HERE'S- AND WE CAN THINK PROPRIA I AM BEAT BUT AS A MAY IT'S A HEALTH PLAN MANDATE WE'RE WHAT WE CAN TO COMPLY WITH THAT THEY. THANK YOU THERE. WE LOOK IN FRONT THAT. PROCESS THAT. IT AND A SERVICE LIKE. WELL IT'S A- OF SOME OF THE ANY. FOR PEOPLE SAID. I EXPECTED BY HELP. TO PAY FOR IT AND IT'S NOT AND SO WHERE. WAS THE LINE REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE WE DON'T COVER ANY OF IT GO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN THE SCHOOL OR WAS IT THAT. YOU KNOW DO WE DRAW OTHER THAN ACTUALLY FORCE WE WHAT THE RESULTS WERE IN THE END BUT YEAH. YEAH I MEAN I THINK I WELL THIS WITH THAT YOU KNOW. THIS IT REALLY TOUGH NUT TO CRACK- THOUSAND THAT WE HAD TO CRACK BEFORE YEAH IT WAS INDIAN YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE THE- LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY LANDED WAS AT A NEED TO STEP IN AND DECIDE THE QUESTION AND SO- YOU KNOW COULD THERE'D BEEN- YOU KNOW SOME WORK DONE BEFORE HAND. KIND OF YOU KNOW ALLEN THOSE ISSUES SO DIDN'T GET TO LEGISLATION YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE I AGAIN I WASN'T A PART OF OUR RIGHT. THOSE DISCUSSIONS- BUT YOU. MANY OF THEIR COVERAGE POLICIES AT THE PLANS HAVE ARE ARE BASED ON WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE SO. IF IT'S COMMENDED BY. YOUR REVIEW MEDICAL GUIDANCE NIGHT THAT THAT HAS A STRONG. ON WHETHER A PLANNED THING SAID IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE COVERED OR NOT. IF SOMETHING'S CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL. THEN IT MIGHT NOT BE VIEWED AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT OF PREMIUM DOLLARS SO I THINK YOU KNOW- I DON'T THIS FULLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS BUT BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW. TO YOU CENTERS IN EVOLUTION THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT'S IT WHAT'S WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THOSE THINGS LIKE SEEPING INTO- BE A CONSIDERATION OF HOW. PLANS DEVELOP THEIR- THEIR COVERAGE POLICIES SO- I THINK AT THE TIME YOU KNOW IN JUST A GOING BACK THAT EXAMPLE SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE SERVICES RETURNING TO EXPERIMENT. BUT YOU KNOW LEGALLY TV OUT. OF IT PARTY. OKAY YEAH I THINK I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. AND ANY COMMENTS FROM. OUR REPRESENTS HERE TO SAY ESPECIALLY IN A TO GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF- AUTISM AWESOME SPECTER DISORDER AND INCLUDING THAT IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A LOT OF THOSE YOU SAID INTO THE HOUSE AND IN. IT GOING TO THE AND IT IS CONSUMER ADVOCATES WE BELIEVE IN THE ABILITY OF THE PROCESS TO HELP US DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE. SHOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME A BENEFIT MANDATES- THE AND IT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIGGER. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT- THE MANY PROPOSAL IT. A. R. DELAYED WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR THE SO. WITH AUTISM IF THAT'S IT IF IT'S DELAYED FOR A YEAR OR TWO THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THOSE CHILDREN WHERE- IT YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO BACK IN TIME AND THEN. IN MAKE UP FOR THE BOSS IS THAT WERE NOT COVERED. I'M SO WHAT WE HAVE EIGHT OF SOME DISCUSSION. BEATING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS AND SO FORTH. ULTIMATELY WE HAVE. WRONG IN THIS SAYS THE AS- THE PROCESS WORKS NOT ONLY BENEFIT MANDATES BUT LET. ALL AT. THAT WE CAN GET IT IS. AND WE OUT. OF THE BILLS THAT PART. ON THESE OF THE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND THE CHRONIC DISEASE. IT'S A IT'S A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE FIXED BY ONE DOCTOR VISIT OR WHEN. I A OUR VISIT AND I THINK WE OFTENTIMES LOSE TRACK OF THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH THIS DISEASE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT AS MEDICINE CHANGES DISEASE CHECK. IN TIME WE'RE NEEDING THINGS I HAVE OF WHAT. OF MEDICINE PROVIDE OR IT TO THE BUT WE CAN'T GET IT AND THAT HAS BEEN A BIG BIG PROBLEM IN THE CHRONIC CARE WORLD. IS THAT WE JUST CAN'T ACCESS TO. THE THINGS THAT WE NEED BASIC THINGS. SO I WITH A LIFE THAT ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED. THANK THE OTHER THING AT ANY AND THIS THE PREFERABLY IN MY MIND IS THAT WE GIVE THE INCENTIVES TO PULL THE DEVELOP WEATHERS THE BENEFIT DESIGNS ARE THE COVERAGES. TO TAKE CARE OF THE SEASONS OF TRYING TO LEGISLATORS SO FOR EXAMPLE. FOR CHRONIC AND- RIGHT WE CREATE COPAYS I MEAN IT CAME FROM THE RAND STUDY TO HAVE PEOPLE THINK TWICE ABOUT IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT PITNEY BOWES IT'D EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY ZEROED OUT- PAID FOR STORY. IS FOR PEOPLE LAST MONTH DOES AFTER ALL. THERE'S NOT AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT THE SCOURGE FROM USING THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY KEEPS THEM FROM EXACERBATE AS MOTION LEADS TO BE IN THE YARD HOSPITALS SO FORTH AND- THAT ACTUALLY SHOWN IT. SAVES MONEY ACTUALLY TO DO THAT THAT THE YEAH YES THE- UTILIZATION OF THE STORYTELLERS WENT UP. THAT WASN'T SO BAD THING BECAUSE THE ER VISITS AND THE HOUSE POLLUTION AND THESE ARE ALL. PEOPLE BY THE WAY SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES SO THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT UNEMPLOYED. THEY THEY MADE MONEY THEY COULD MAKE. WELL THEY'LL I CAN USE. THIS DOES EXACTLY EACH PERSON BUT- NOW THEY HAD INCOME TO PAY THE COPAY BUT IT BUT THE COPAY AND THE PERSON THE COPAYS MAKE PEOPLE THINK TWICE SO. CERTAINLY SOME MEDICATIONS MAKES SENSE OTHER MEDICATIONS I AM ARGUE THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T LEGISLATE AS A CARD. SAYING NECESSARILY BUT- WE WANT INCENTIVIZE. PEOPLE THINK MAYBE SMARTER IF IT DOES FIND AT. IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONDITION GET ACT. TO AREAS IN FRONT OF THEM THAT MIGHT. BECAUSE THE TO THE LESS LIKELY TO SENSES BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE OVERALL INCENTIVE IS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE PLAN THAT'S KNOWN AS THE BEST YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT TREATS PEOPLE AND DISEASE THE BEST ARE AS A BASS IT'S RELATIVE THING BUT- YOU KNOW WHERE AND I'M TRYING TO SEE. I'M GOING TO THAT. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THE PLANET. LARA AND FROM AN ACTUAL STAND SO HOW HOW DO WE HOW WHAT DO YOU KNOW. WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THAT SO. AND IT'S FOR YEAH WE DON'T ALLEGE. PARTICULAR DESIGN BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WE CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE THAN. BUT HOW INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP THESE KIND MORE. INNOVATIVE THE BENEFIT DESIGNS. RIGHT SO I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE BEYOND JUST. INSURANCE MANDATES BUT- YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW WITH WITH RESPECT TO CARD CONDITIONS OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE USED THEIR OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW AND- MANY IF NOT. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE SMART SPECIALTY MEDS THAT YOU KNOW- REPRESENT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS BUT A GIGANTIC PERCENTAGE OF THE COST- IN SO THAT HAS AN IMPACT. ON THE YOU KNOW- STRUCTURE IN PRICING- SO YOU KNOW IF I. SOME PLAN ARE ON THEIR OWN INNOVATING IN THAT DEPARTMENT AND THERE ARE CERTAIN DRUGS- WHERE. THE PLAN ON ITS OWN HAS BEEN ABLE TO LOWER THE COST TO PAY- TO DO A VERY AFFORDABLE LEVELS. YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD LEGISLATE THOSE THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO LEGISLATIVELY YOU'RE BASICALLY UNDERCUTTING THE HEALTH PLAN- BIG TIME BECAUSE- THEY'RE ABLE TO. LOWER THOSE COSTS FOR TUMORS BECAUSE- ON- THEY'RE ABLE TO GET A GREAT PRICE. FROM THE DRUG MANUFACTURER THE DEVICE MANUFACTURE. LEGISLATE THAT. YOU BASICALLY RICH COMPLETELY REMOVING LEVERAGE ON THE PART OF THE PAYER TO GET THOSE GREAT DEALS. ON MENS. SO PLANS ARE A FEW THE NOW YET IS A CASE BY CASE. BUT THERE WHAT THEY CAN. IN EXPERT. WITH IN THE CONFINES OF YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL RARE REAL VALUE BENEFIT DESIGN RESTRICTIONS- OF THE A. C. A. AND A LOT OF THE EXPERIMENTATION THAT DEPARTMENT'S GOING ON IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET WHERE THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE LESS RULES REGULATIONS ABOUT THAT- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THOSE EXAMPLES IN FRONT OF ME BUT YOU KNOW I HEAR IT- ANECDOTALLY FROM OUR MEMBERS SO. ON YOU KNOW IT'S ON. SCIENCE AND KNOW THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW WHILE. WITH WITHIN THE CONFINES THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED. SO BUT- YOU WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO. TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. EIGHT AS A NO DOUBT OKAY SO NEXT IS A PUBLIC COMMENT SO WITH A ONE A- SO PLEASE COME UP TO THE FACT MICROPHONE THERE. YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE COMING UP VIA- THERE'S A NAME ORGANIZATION AND- ZERO A LONG LINE I ASK YOU CAN KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO TWO MINUTES OR LESS- BUT- AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO HAND OVER TO THE SERGEANTS OR SOME IT'S ME PLEASE DO SO AS WELL BUT THANK YOU WELCOME. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PRESTON YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE CONVERSATIONS AFTERNOON HAS ALREADY BEEN ROBUST AND PRODUCTIVE SO I DON'T EVEN WANT YOUR TWO MINUTES ALL I TRY TO TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS. THE BUSINESS CAN BE SPECIFICALLY MEMBERS OF THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THEY ARE- SENSITIVE TO INSURANCE MANDATES ME SIR USUALLY BORN OF GOOD TENSIONS HEARING AIDS MEDIC EVER BE. GAP IN THE CITY. AND IT'S AS YOU. WITH THE SYSTEMIC. COUNTER EVERY THERE IS. AND THAT'S THE OF SO WHEN PREMIUMS ARE INCREASING INCREASES THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS EMPLOYERS AND YOU SEE YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH PREMIUMS INCREASING DOUBLE PERCENTAGE POINTS MAYBE 14% LAST YEAR AND I THINK THIRTEEN POINT 2% THE YEAR BEFORE SO- MANDATES THEY ARE SENSITIVE TOPIC BUT- THE CHAMBER IS IN A POSITION. GRAY WILL POST OFFICE ALL MANDATES THAT COME ACROSS THE DESK IN THE REASON WHY IS IT INCREASES THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS SO- I THINK TODAY'S CONVERSATION WAS FANTASTIC I THINK. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BEING INSTITUTED ALL IS ALSO A SIGN OF THINGS HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THAT BEING SAID THE CHAMBER WOULD LIKE TO BE A PART OF CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD SOUND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS. CONVERSATIONS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU SEEN NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT THE CHIU WITH SPEECH YOU WILL HAVE A SOME CLOSING THANK YOU TO EVERYONE- FOR THEIR- PRESENTATIONS THIS AFTERNOON- THIS IS A AS WE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THIS IS A TIMELY ISSUE AS WE START LOOKING AT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FOR AN OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT- PEOPLE FACE- WITH RISING PREMIUMS ALTHOUGH THIS YEAR'S IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE SEE- THE CHANGE- THE LOW COST LOW RISE. AND I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVES OF HOW WE MIGHT LOOK AT- MANDATES IN THE FUTURE- AND- AND BUT I ALSO- WILL RE RE EMPHASIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS LEGISLATORS FROM PRESSURES FROM FROM FROM OUR- OUR CONSTITUENTS AND- AND IT'S ALWAYS A BIT OF A BALANCING ACT HOW WE HOW WE GO FORWARD. BUT VERY TIMELY DISCUSSION AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT TODAY. I THANK YOU TO HER WOODS- I TWO WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS AND ALL OF YOU WHO ARE HAVE BEEN- WATCHING EITHER IN THE AUDIENCE OR- WATCHING OUR FOR A SEAT HERE- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK THAT THAT IN BOTH OF US AS CHAIR SINCE. FELT THAT WE NEED TO- TO REVISIT- BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS FOR MANY YEARS. SINCE WE ESTABLISHED THE WORK ON A CM PLANTATION AND ESTABLISH THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS I THINK- APPRECIATE. REALLY THAT THE TESTIMONY AND I THINK THAT. BE IT IS A- THAT WE HAVE CONFERENCE PLAN. THAT WHO THE AC WE TRY TO RID THE JUNK PLANS AND YOU'LL CALL JUNK PLAN BECAUSE THE FOR IS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY GOT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND WHEN THE TIME CAME- IT FAILED THEM AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK DEFINITELY DID DRIVE- PASSAGE OF THE ACA- AND SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE PROMISE OF IT VERY INEXPENSIVE PLANNED THEN WHEN YOU. FINALLY GOT SICK OR YOU GET INJURED IT TURNS BUT IT WASN'T THERE. AND SO YOU KNOW WE DID WANT TO BE SURE WE HAVE STANDARDS AND THAT THEY WERE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS. NOW WHAT THIS COMPREHENSIVE. WORKED VERY HARD TO BE SURE WE HAVE AND I THINK WE DO HAVE VERY COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE- THROUGH OUR- THE PLAN WE SELECTED. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME GAPS AND THEN OF COURSE THINGS HAVE. ALSO EVOLVED OVER TIME SO- THAT WAS NO BACK AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT BENCHMARK PLAN THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY BASED ON SAID BENEFITS AND- WELL THAT- AND DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY ELEVEN SO IT'S NOW TWENTY TWENTY. NINE YEARS LATER AND I ALSO DO AND- I APPRECIATE THAT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO COME TO US WHO WANT. MANDATES OUR- TO THEY THAT PEOPLE UP EXPERIENCES AND- IS A VERY IMPORTANT BASS OF FREE TO SAY THAT WOULD LOOK AT THE MORE SUS THAT. AND AT AND THAT WE SHOULD THINK OF. WICKS RE VISIT. YOU KNOW OUR PACKAGE. IT IN SOME WAY JUST. BECAUSE I THINK WITH THE DOING THAT ON THAT I THINK. WE SEE PERHAPS PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL DON'T. REALLY UPSET WE HAVE BUT ALSO MAY LOSE A LOW CONFIDENCE AND AS WELL I THINK THAT. WE TO BE SURE WE CAN THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT PROVIDE. WHAT YA THE END AND I'LL REAL.
