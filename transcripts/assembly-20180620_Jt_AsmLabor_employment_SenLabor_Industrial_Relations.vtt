AND THIS IS SORT OF A A

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.810
CONTRACTUAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:19.311

THAT REGION.

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:27.652
AND IT ALSO ENSURES THAT MOST

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:31.456
AND HARD SERVICES ARE PROVIDED

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:32.624
WITH IN AT A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:33.892
SO THERE'S THERE'S A TIME

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.094
REQUIREMENT ON ON NINE ONE ONE

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.063
BECAUSE THE AMBULANCE HAS TO GET

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:40.966
EIGHT TO TWELVE MINUTES AN ON

00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:41.700
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.234
CONTRACTUAL CHANGE FOR THE

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.036
AMBULANCE PROVIDERS THIS SORT OF

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.638
A GUARANTEED INSURER REVENUE

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.340

RESPONDING TO ALL THE CALLS ON

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:50.842
HIS OWN.

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:52.410
AND THEREFORE ROOM WILL RECEIVE --

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:54.646
BILLING CHARGES FOR ALL THOSE

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:55.714
ALL THOSE TRANSPORTS

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.014
[inaudible]

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:59.551
ON IN MOST CASES EITHER

00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:00.518
GOVERNMENT PROVIDED OR

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.420
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PAYS FOR

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:03.722
THE COST OF AMBULANCE TRIPS

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:04.889
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AMBULANCE

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.524
TRIPS ARE FOR PATIENTS WITH

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.026
MEDICARE OR MEDICAID HOW.

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:10.261
IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 20% ARE FOR

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.830
PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL HEALTH

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:13.131
INSURANCE AND THE REST ARE FOR

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:14.933
PATIENTS WITH WITH NO HEALTH

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.402
INSURANCE WHATSOEVER --

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.304
TURNING TO PAGE.

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:19.904
THREE DESCRIBE BRIEFLY SOME OF

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:20.972
WHAT A TYPICAL AMBULANCE TRIP

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.008
COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:25.343
THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.246
DOLLARS ON AVERAGE PER TRIP --

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:30.648
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW --

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:32.917
ARE BUILD A SOMEWHAT LESS THAN

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:35.053
THAT AMOUNT THERE REIMBURSEMENT

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.421
FOR AMULETS PROVIDERS IS LOWER

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.689
THAN THE AVERAGE COST OF AN

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.124
AMBULANCE TRIP IN THE STATE.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.792
SO TO MAKE UP FOR THESE LOSSES A

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.360
PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.995
ACTUALLY BILL COMMERCIAL HEALTH

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:45.563
INSURERS MUCH MORE THAN THE

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.333
AVERAGE COSTS ARM UP TO ABOUT

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.900
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:52.170
TRIP ON AVERAGE --

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.138
FOR FOR THESE SERVICES AND IN

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:55.006
THIS WAY AMBULANCE PROVIDERS

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:56.441
BALANCE OUT THERE THEIR PAYER

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.709
MAX IN ORDER TO COVER THEIR

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.577
COSTS.

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.713
I'M TURNING TO THE TOP OF PAGE

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.181
FOUR WILL GET INTO EMTS AND

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.250
PARAMEDICS THEMSELVES AND THEIR

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:06.885
RESTING MEAL BREAK STRUCTURES.

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.920
THEY'RE ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.422
EMTS AND PARAMEDICS CURRENTLY

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:11.723
ACTIVE IN THE STATE.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.458
AND MOST AMBULANCE CREWS ARE

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.260
CONSIST OF ONE EMT AND ONE

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.928
PARAMEDIC THEY TYPICALLY WORK

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.163
TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS THOUGH IN

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:19.831
SOME CASES THEY WORK TWENTY FOUR

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:22.367
HOUR SHIFTS TOGETHER --

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.469
AND LIKE MOST OTHER EMPLOYEES --

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.237
AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:28.506
TO PRIDE BEYOND REST BREAKS TO

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:30.008
THEIR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS.

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.876
BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF THE

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:34.446
NATURE OF THE THE BUSINESS --

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:35.780
EMTS AND PARAMEDICS HAVE

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:38.249
TRADITIONALLY REMAINED ON CALL

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:39.551
DURING THEIR RESTING MEAL BREAKS

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:41.386
SO THEY MIGHT GO AND TAKE A

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:42.120
SCHEDULED MEAL BREAK.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.755
BUT THE NINE ONE ONE CALL COMES

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.590
AND THEY'LL TAKE THAT CALL

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.692
RESPOND TO THE CALL AND THEN TRY

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:48.960
TO RESCHEDULE THEIR MEAL BREAK

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:49.194
LATER.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.929
AND AS A RESULT IS OFTEN

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.430
DIFFICULT FOR EMTS AND

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:53.598
PARAMEDICS TO SCHEDULE THEIR

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:55.667
PRICKS PROFT INTERRUPTED AND

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:57.202
SOMETIMES THEY WON'T RECEIVE

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.636
THEIR THEIR MEAL BREAK DURING

00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.238
THEIR SHIFT.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:01.940
THOUGH IT AT THE SAME TIME MOST

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:05.043
EMERGENCY AMBULANCE CREWS HAVE

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.678
SUFFICIENT WORK SIGNIFICANT

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.780
DOWNTIME DURING THEIR SHIFT THEY

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:09.681
ARE THEY'RE POSTED AT THEIR

00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:11.850
LOCATION AND AND WAITING FOR A

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:12.717
NINE ONE ONE CALL TO COME AND

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.052
BUT MAYBE THERE'S AN HOUR TO IN

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.587
BETWEEN CALLS.

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:16.588
SO DURING THESE TIMES THESE

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:19.557
PERIODS OF DOWNTIME CREWS CAN

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:21.726
TYPICALLY TAKE A BREAK.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:22.660
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MAYBE PRE

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:24.395
SCHEDULED AND THAT IT COULD BE

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:25.797
INTERRUPTED THEY DON'T KNOW FOR

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:26.264
SURE THAT IT WON'T BE

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:29.033
INTERRUPTED --

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.937
AND TURNING TO TO THE NEXT PAGE --

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:33.738
THIS LONGSTANDING INDUSTRY

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:36.274
PRACTICE OF HAVING EMTS AND

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.876
PARAMEDICS STAY ON CALL DURING

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.077
BREAK --

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:41.412
COULD BE AFFECTED BY RECENT

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.114
STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION I

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:44.916
AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:47.252
SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT ON CALL

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:49.354
BREAKS OF THIS NATURE ACTUALLY

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.822
VIOLATE STATE LABOR LAW.

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:53.024
AND INSTEAD THE COURT FOUND THAT

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:55.660
EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE OFF DUTY

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.328
BREAKS THAT ARE UNINTERRUPTIBLE

00:29:57.395 --> 00:30:00.698
SO THE CASE WAS A JUSTICE V. AB

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:01.799
AND SECURITY SERVICES.

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.268
CHATTED WITH PRIVATE SECURITY

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:04.802
GUARDS THAT WERE REQUIRED AT THE

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.738
TIME TO KEEP A WALKIE TALKIE ON

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.540
THEM DURING THEIR BREAKS AND THE

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:10.208
COURT FOUND THAT THIS ACTUALLY

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:11.309
VIOLATED STATE LAW.

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:14.078
AND IT DID DID NOT QUALIFY AS A

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:14.979
BREAK BECAUSE THEY WERE ON CALL

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:15.280
[inaudible]

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:18.716
ON THE LABOR LAWS AND WAGE

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:20.451
ORDERS THAT RELATE TO PRIVATE

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:21.719
SECURITY GUARDS ON THE A JUSTICE

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:24.355
CASE ARE PRETTY SIMILAR. TO

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:26.291
THOSE THAT APPLY TO EMTS AND

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:28.693
PARAMEDICS AND AS A RESULT IT

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.095
APPEARS LIKELY THAT THE THE

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.231
DECISION AND THE AT JUSTICE CASE

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:35.066
WHAT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE.

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.968
BE FOUND TO APPLY TO EMTS AND

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:40.405
PARAMEDICS BY THE STATE'S COURTS --

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.840
SO MOVING TO THE NEXT SO THE

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:43.474
PIECE OF BACKGROUND.

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:45.577
ON PAGE.

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.111
SIX WE HAVE TO ASSESS.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.746
WHAT THE LIKELY OUTCOME WOULD BE

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:51.115
FOR THE CURRENT --

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:54.118
CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICE IF EMT

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.588
AND PARAMEDICS ARE PROVIDED OFF

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:57.222
DUTY BREAKS UNDER THIS

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.856
EXHAUSTIVE DECISION AND WE SEE

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:00.892
THAT THIS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.860
COSTS FOR PRIVATE AMBULANCE

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:03.628
COMPANIES.

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.296
ON BECAUSE IN ORDER TO BRING

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.731
MEET MEET THE RESPONSE TIME

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:08.366
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THEIR

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.201
CONTRACTS WITH COUNTIES --

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.903
THEY WOULD HAVE TO LIKELY AT AN

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.705
ADDITIONAL AMBULANCE UNIT OR

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:15.940
PERHAPS PERHAPS TO IN SOME AREAS

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:18.109
SO THAT SOME COULD GO ON BREAKS

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:19.611
ESSENTIALLY TURNING THEIR RADIOS

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.346
OFF FOR THAT THIRTY MINUTE

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:22.113
PERIOD.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.481
AND THEY WOULD HAVE AN

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.283
ADDITIONAL AMBULANCE IN THE AREA

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.651
TO RESPOND TO A NINE ONE ONE

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.686
CALL THAT WOULD COME DOWN --

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.154
STATEWIDE WE THINK THAT THESE

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.357
NEW COSTS POTENTIALLY BE IN

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.691
EXCESS OF A HUNDRED MILLION

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.326
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.028
AND IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEW

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.330
COSTS AMBULANCE COMPANIES IN

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.932
ORDER TO REMAIN PROFITABLE COULD

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:42.400
MAKE CERTAIN.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:43.868
COULD RESPOND IN IN A VARIETY OF

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:47.205
WAYS ON WE GOT THEM LISTED HERE

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.107
FIRST WE WE THINK THAT SOME

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.208
AMBULANCE COMPANIES COULD

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:51.242
NEGOTIATE.

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.011
COMPROMISE AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.379
LABOR UNIONS ARE WHICH WOULD

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:55.913
SUPERSEDE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.248
JUSTICE AND SORT OF BE A MIDDLE

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:58.950
GROUND TO FULL COMPLIANCE AND

00:31:59.017 --> 00:31:59.250
THEREFORE.

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:01.552
REDUCE SOME COSTS.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.521
SECONDLY AMBULANCE COMPANIES

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:05.323
COULD ATTEMPT TO BILL COMMERCIAL

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.258
INSURERS AT HIGHER AMOUNTS TO

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:08.793
RECRUIT ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.396
OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS.

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:13.097
MON THIRD AMBULANCE COMPANIES

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.432
COULD LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.901
THEIR OPERATING COSTS SO FOR

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:18.336
INSTANCE THEY COULD TRY DOING

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.570
MORE CASES HAVE AN AMBULANCE

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:21.572
STAFF WITH TO IT EMTS.

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:22.874
SUPPOSED TO AN EMT AND A

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.243
PARAMEDIC HIM TEASED WAITERS

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.611
ARTS ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.513
THOSE FOR PARAMEDICS SO THAT

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:29.814
SORT OF OPERATIONAL CHANGE MIGHT

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.482
REDUCE SOME OF THEIR COSTS.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:33.418
A OPERATIONAL CHANGES SUCH AS

00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:34.285
THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:36.220
RENEGOTIATED WITH THE COUNTIES

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:37.388
BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD CHANGE

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.357
THEIR CONTRACTS --

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.259
AND FINALLY.

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:43.394
WE THINK THAT IN MANY INSTANCES

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.063
AMBULANCE COMPANIES WILL WILL

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.964
SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:48.066
CONTRACTS WITH THE COUNTY.

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.234
I EMERGENCY SERVICES AGENCIES

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.570
AND BY RENEGOTIATE I MEAN IN

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.372
ORDER TO REMAIN PROFITABLE.

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.007
THEY MAY SAY TO A COUNTY.

00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:57.675
THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO CONTINUE

00:32:57.742 --> 00:32:59.210
PAYING THE ANNUAL FEE THAT WAS

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:01.179
IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT IN THAT

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:02.180
THEY WOULD NEED TO REDUCE THIS

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:04.215
ANNUAL FEE --

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:05.717
IN SOME CASES EVEN THEY MAY NOW

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.485
BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS THE

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.620
COUNTY WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT OF

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:11.322
THESE NEW COSTS AND THE COULD IN

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:12.423
THESE CASES.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.926
REQUIRE OR SEEK A SUBSIDY FROM

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:16.761
THE COUNTY TO THE AMBULANCE

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.963
PROVIDER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.798
OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA.

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:23.568
ODD GIVEN THE NEW COSTS --

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:26.637
IF YOU TURN TO PAGES SEVEN

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.272
MOVEON DEBT TO THIS PROPOSAL

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.707
SPECIFICALLY.

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:31.976
AND IT WOULD.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:34.379
REQUIRED THAT HE M. TEAS AND

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:37.281
PARAMEDICS REMAIN ON CALL DURING

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.750
THEIR ENTIRE WORK SHIFT SO IN

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.017
EFFECT IT WOULD BE A

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:42.687
CONTINUATION AND AUTHORIZATION

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:43.187
OF LONGSTANDING INDUSTRY

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:45.556
PRACTICE.

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.425
IT WOULD ALSO SEEK.

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.659
TO TAKE THIS REQUIREMENT BUT

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.094
DANTE AND PARAMEDICS STAY ON

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:53.030
CALL AND APPLY RETROACTIVELY. TO

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:54.399
LEGAL CASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:57.235
IN THE COURTS THAT EMTS AND

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.436
PARAMEDICS HAVE BROUGHT AGAINST

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.204
PRIVATE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS --

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.440
SEEKING.

00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:03.775
DAMAGES FOR FOR ALLEGED

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:07.345
VIOLATION OF OF ME ON BREAK LOS.

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:09.547
ADDITIONALLY THE MEASURE WOULD

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.215
REQUIRE THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:13.618
PROVIDE IMPROVED BREAK SCHEDULES

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.219
FOR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS AND THAT

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:16.854
THEY IMPLY.

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:18.756
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.091
MAKE AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.759
CARE SERVICES FOR THEIR EMTS AND

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:24.762
PARAMEDICS --

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:27.565
TURNING TO THE THE FINAL PAGE.

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:30.101
WHERE WE ASSESS?

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:31.335
THE LIKELY FISCAL AFFECTS OF THE

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.070
INITIATIVE.

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:34.205
THIS MEASURE IS SOMEWHAT COMPLEX

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:38.109
BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE.

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:40.545
TO ASSESS WHAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:43.047
IN THE IN THE AMBULANCE INDUSTRY

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.749
UNDER THE ACOSTA DECISION.

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.484
AND COMPARE THAT TO WHAT WOULD

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.919
HAPPEN AYE IF VOTERS WERE TO

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:50.087
APPROVE THE MEASURE.

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:50.588
SO BECAUSE THE AUGUSTA'S

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.089
DECISION IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.191
NEW COSTS FOR AMBULANCE

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:54.492
COMPANIES.

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.327
AND THEREFORE NEW COSTS FOR FOR

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:57.929
COUNTY GOVERNMENTS --

00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:59.163
A CONTINUATION OF CURRENT

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.932
PRACTICE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.934
THIS MEASURE WOULD WOULD LIKELY

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.835
RESULT.

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:05.570
IN ARE FISCAL BENEFITS TO LOCAL

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:08.506
GOVERNMENTS I IN THE TENS OF

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.241
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:11.809
AND WE USED THE PHRASE FISCAL

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.444
BENEFITS BECAUSE IN SOME CASES

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.979
IT COULD BE ADDITIONAL FEE

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.881
REVENUE FROM THE COUNTY.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.583
BUT IN OTHER CASES IT COULD BE A

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:21.452
SMALLER SUBSIDY FROM THE COUNTY

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.687
TO THE AMBULANCE PROVIDER IT

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:23.888
COULD BE ANSWERED OF EITHER SIDE

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.790
THE LEDGER SO WE TURN THAT

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:27.859
FISCAL BENEFITS AGAIN AND IN THE

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:28.493
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.846
RESPONSIBLE FOR TREATING AND

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:04.281

CASES.

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:18.129
WE ALSO I THINK ARE VERY GOOD --

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:20.498
COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.366
IN THAT WE PROVIDE A TENS OF

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.102
UNCOMPENSATED CARE TO

INDIVIDUALS --

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:29.473
WE ALSO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE YOU

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.009

AND SENIOR CENTERS AND ELSEWHERE.

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.447
SO HOW DID WE GET HERE ALLIES

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:38.582
THE LA OWE INDICATED IN DECEMBER

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.284
OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUGUSTA'S

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:41.819
DECISION CAME DOWN.

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.254
NOW WHILE AUGUSTA'S DID DEAL

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.122
WITH SECURITY GUARDS AT IF YOU

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:46.791
LOOK AT THE WAGE AND IF YOU LOOK

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:50.327
AT THE WAGE ORDERS IN THE STATE.

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.595
THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SORT OF

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.130
LANGUAGE.

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:55.399
AND SO OUR INDUSTRY QUICKLY

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.301
LOOKED AT IT AND THOUGHT WELL IF

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.103
THEY'RE GONNA DO INTERPRET THAT

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.038
EXACT SAME LANGUAGE IN OUR WAGE

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:03.140
ORDER AS IN THE OTHER WAGE ORDER

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:04.942
APPLICABLE TO SECURITY GUARDS.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.310
THAT SAYS WE CAN'T CONTACT THOSE

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:07.845
INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY ARE ON

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.046
BREAK.

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:10.915
THAT COULD HAVE SERIOUS --

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.016
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.885
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE AMBULANCE

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.687
INDUSTRY.

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.589
AND SO AS A RESULT WE ACTUALLY

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.725
CAME FIRST TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.293
AND YOU ON MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:23.060
THURMAN.

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:24.562
OF MIGHT RECALL THAT THERE WERE

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:27.465
TWO MEASURES A YOUR VICE CHAIR --

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.966
HEATH FLORA INTRODUCED

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.768
LEGISLATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.203
SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.004
AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION.

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:36.340
AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL THE

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.308
OPPONENTS TO THIS MEASURE THAT

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.943
YOU'LL HEAR FROM SHORTLY WITH

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.311
THE SPONSORS OF THE SECOND MAJOR.

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:43.948
ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ IS AB.

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.750
TWO SIXTY THREE AND WE PURSUED

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.485
LEGISLATION HAD LEAST INITIALLY

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.787
BECAUSE AGAIN WE THOUGHT WE NEED

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.589
TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:54.091
EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ON A BREAK.

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.459
THAT THEY BE A OF THAT WE BE

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.495
ABLE TO CONTACT THE WE SIMPLY

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.363
CAN'T.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.898
LET ME LET ME POINT SOMETHING

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:03.367
OUT ONLY HOSPITALS.

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.770
AND THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:06.837
REQUIRED BY LAW.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.873
I TREAT EVERYONE.

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.074
WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS 911- WE

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.409
DON'T ASK HOW CAN YOU PAY FOR

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:14.345
THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT?

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:17.681
WE RESPOND HOSPITAL ER'S DUE.

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:18.849
TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.151
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US SO ALL

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:21.218
THOSE OTHER LIKE MEDI CAL

00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:23.687
PROVIDERS DOCTORS DENNIS.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.622
THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR PATIENTS

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.757
WE CAN'T.

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.559
WITH THE HOSPITAL ER THOUGH THEY

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.194
GET TO YOU WHEN THEY GET TO YOU

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.396
WE BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO DO SO

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:33.664
WITHIN THE CONTRACTED PERIOD OF

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.065
TIME.

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:36.801
SO WE ARE VERY UNIQUE.

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:40.171
AND AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO ENSURE.

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.173
THAT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES GET

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:42.673
THE BRAKES THAT THEY ARE

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.841
ENTITLED.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:44.875
TO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.577
INTERRUPTED.

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:48.179
AND SO WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.247
ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ AND THE

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:51.882
SPONSORS OF THAT MEASURE THAT.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.751
WHILE IT PASSED THIS HOUSES NOW

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.119
HAS BEEN SITTING THE PAST THREE

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.353
QUARTERS OF A YEAR IN THE SENATE

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.122
RULES COMMITTEE --

00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.890
AFTER PASSING THE SENATE LABOR

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.059
COMMITTEE AND THE ISSUE THERE

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.627
AND THAT HAS BEEN ALL ALONG IS

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.729
THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.398
EMPLOYEES GET THEIR BREAK.

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.566
IF THEY ARE --

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.134
INTERRUPTED.

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:12.469
THEY SHOULD BE RESCHEDULED.

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.205
AND IF THEY CAN'T BE RESCHEDULED.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.173
THEN THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.741
ONE HOUR PENALTY PAY.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.276
THAT'S WHAT EXISTING LAW HAS

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:21.445
BEEN FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS THAT'S

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.380
WHAT IT CONTINUE SHOULD THAT'S

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.649
WHAT IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE.

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:26.750
NOW THAT IS WHAT WE ATTEMPTED TO

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.018
DO LEGISLATIVELY AND

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.954
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DID NOT COME

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.789
TO FRUITION.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.791
IN THE MEANTIME OR DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:35.759
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.528
ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESSENTIALLY

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:40.231
SAID THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION IS

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.432
APPLICABLE TO EVERYBODY

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:41.732
[inaudible]

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:44.702
WHICH WHETHER I PERSONALLY LIKE

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:45.936
IT OR NOT I THINK THAT'S

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:48.172
PROBABLY A LOGICAL PLACE FOR

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.274
THEM TO END UP BECAUSE AGAIN AS

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.575
I SAID EARLIER ALL THE WAGE

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:52.810
ORDERS HAVE THE SAME SORT OF

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.511
LANGUAGE THAT WAS INTERPRETED.

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.647
IN THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION.

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:57.982
I'M JUST A QUOTE FROM THAT

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.884
DECISION ONE SENDS DURING

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.752
REQUIRED REST PERIODS.

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:02.953
EMPLOYERS MUST RELIEVE THEIR

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.622
EMPLOYEES OF ALL DUTIES AND

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.557
RELINQUISH ANY CONTROL OVER HOW

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.993
EMPLOYEE SPEND THEIR BREAK TIME.

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:11.428
SO AGAIN THAT MEANS RADIOS TWO

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:14.031
WAY COMMUNICATION DEVICES PAGER

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.766
CELL PHONES THAT WOULD ALL HAVE

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:17.167
TO BE OFF AND AGAIN.

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.903
WHEN WE HAVE TO RESPOND WITHIN

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:21.038
MINUTES GENTLY FIVE TO SEVEN

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.406
MINUTES OR CONTRACTED TIME

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.574
DEPENDING ON JURISDICTIONS AND

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:25.075
ALL?

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.810
WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.779
BE CONTACTED AND I THINK QUITE

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.180
FRANKLY THAT THE MEMBERS OF YOUR

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.682
COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN.

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.716
AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:34.084
LABOR COMMITTEE WERE VERY

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:36.120
SYMPATHETIC TO THAT POINT.

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.788
BUT NONE THE LESS BECAUSE THE

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:40.658
COURT INTERPRETATION OF THIS.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.625
THE APPLICATION FROM THE

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.294
ADMINISTRATION AS TO ALL OTHER

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.963
INDUSTRIES AND THE FAILURE OF A

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.365
LEGISLATIVE FIX LAST YEAR.

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:49.934
DROVE THE PROPONENTS OF THE

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.702
SPONSORS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:54.571
TO PROCEED TO THE BALLOT --

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:56.974
AND I THINK THAT IS AN EFFORT TO

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.676
ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.311
AND SAFETY.

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.913
IS ADEQUATELY INSURED --%

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.848
IT'S JUST UNREALISTIC FROM OUR

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.183
HUMBLE PERSPECTIVE TO THINK THAT

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.585
THAT --

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:09.920
INTERPRETATION WOULD BE

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:12.289
APPLICABLE TO OUR INDUSTRY AGAIN

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:14.725
WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS 911- THEY

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.694
EXPECT PROMPT SERVICE AND THAT'S

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.395
WHAT WE'RE CONTRACTED AND

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:21.765
LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DO --

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:22.499
IT DOES HAVE SOME OTHER

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.668
PROVISIONS.

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.704
BUT IN THE BILL IT HAS THREE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.705
MAIN PROVISIONS FROM OUR

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.540
PERSPECTIVE AND WHY WE ENDORSED

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.041
THE BALLOT MEASURE.

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.877
THE FIRST IS TRAINING ANNUALLY

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.714
FOR MASS CASUALTY ACTIVITIES.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.716
A ACTIVE SHOOTERS AND OTHER

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:40.751
NATURAL DISASTERS --

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.286
HAVING THAT ANNUAL TRAINING IS

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:44.188
IMPORTANT FOR OUR PERSONNEL OF

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.589
COURSE IT'S APPROPRIATELY

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.591
EMPLOYER PAID.

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:49.059
THE SECOND MAJOR PROVISION IS

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.361
EMPLOYERPAID --

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:53.163
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS A

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.798
EDUCATION AND COVERAGE.

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.567
UP TO TEN MENTAL HEALTH VISITS

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:59.269
PER YEAR AGAIN EMPLOYER PAID.

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:00.371
AND THEN OF COURSE TO CONTINUE

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:04.241
THE FIVE DECADE PLUS APPROACH --

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.543
IN TERMS OF MEAL AND REST BREAKS

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.544
WHICH AGAIN.

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.613
A THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO WE

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.415
WANT OUR EMPLOYEES ENTITLED TO

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:11.815
IT.

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:13.650
AND IF WE HAVE TO INTERRUPT

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.686
THOSE MEAL REST BREAKS THEY

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.888
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RESCHEDULED

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:19.123
AND IF WE CAN'T THEY SHOULD BE

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:22.026
COMPENSATED TO DO SO UP FOR FOR

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:22.926
US BEING UNABLE TO RESCHEDULE

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:23.660
THEM.

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.762
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.797
INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND THAT'S

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.265
WHAT IT CONTINUE SHOULD BE.

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.933
UP BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS SORT

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.935
OF AN EFFORT THAT'S ENCAPSULATED

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:34.238
IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE BECAUSE

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.206
AT THIS POINT IF WE CAN ACHIEVE

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.875
A LEGISLATIVE FIX.

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.376

THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL DID

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.093
NOT MENTION THAT THIS IS A

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.324
GO TO EAP COUNSELORS THEIR

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:49.626
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY COUNSELORS.

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:50.794
WHICH ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.329
THE PTSD IN THE CRITICAL

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.330
INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:54.164
THERAPY THAT WE NEED

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:54.464
[inaudible]

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.033
SO AGAIN.

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.001
IT'S SUB STANDARD BUT IT IS AN

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.102
INCREASE THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.271
IN CONCEPT.

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.806
BUT AGAIN WE ARE NOT IN A

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:03.940
POSITION TO SUPPORT THE

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:05.676
LIABILITY PROTECTIONS THAT THIS

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:06.643
INITIATIVE SEEKS FOR PRIVATE

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.912
PROVIDERS FOR VIOLATING THE WAGE

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.847
ORDER WHICH WAS AFFIRMED BY

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:13.583
THAT'S THE COURTS.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.352
AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.054
TO WORK THROUGHOUT THE NEXT

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.622
COMING YEARS TO CREATE A

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.624
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION.

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:21.958
BUT THAT PROCESS BROKE DOWN WHEN

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:23.260
THE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS WERE

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:24.127
NOT GUARANTEED A HIGH BEHALF

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:24.995
DURING THE NEGOTIATE

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:25.295
[inaudible]

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:28.799
THANK YOU.

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.801
THANK YOU MISTER GOTTA.

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:31.068
THANK YOU.

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.303
ARE.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:33.904
THANK YOU TO THEIR COMMITTEE

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.906
CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.374
BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE LEGAL

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.508
BACKGROUND THAT LED TO THIS

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.677
INITIATIVE --

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:42.145
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO START WITH

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:42.979
IS THAT THE A JUSTICE BECAUSE

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:44.147
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DID NOT

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.482
CHANGE THE LAW THESE PRACTICES

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:47.150
HAVE BEEN UNLAWFUL SINCE THEY

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.618
WERE INITIATED IT.

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:50.253
IN IT INTERPRETED.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.655
LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN IN THESE

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.190
WAGE ORDERS FOR DECADES.

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.725
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.827
INITIATIVE IS IT'S NOT A PUBLIC

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:59.162
SAFETY MEASURE IT'S A MEASURE TO

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:00.097
FOR AND ARE IN PARTICULAR TO

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.732
AVOID LIABILITY THIS IS A MARGIN

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:03.934
ISSUED OF THEIR SPENT OVER THREE

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.769
MILLION DOLLARS PER --

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.771
SOLICITING SIGNATURES ALREADY.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.272
I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THERE OF

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:09.873
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.708
CAMPAIGN.

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.844
NOW AMHERST TO DEFEND THE

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.445
NORWEGIAN OUR CASE THAT.

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.414
IS THAT THREATENS TO IMPOSE TENS

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.749
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.317
LIABILITY ON THEM.

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.585
FOR THERE PRACTICES INVOLVING

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:22.986
REST BREAKS AND MEAL BREAKS OVER

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.654
THE COURSE OF A DECADE.

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:27.290
NOW THAT LIABILITY HAS INCREASED

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:28.825
BECAUSE AMHERST LITIGATION

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.794
STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DELAY THAT

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.228
CASE FOR A DECADE.

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.396
AND IT'S NOW FINALLY APPROACHING

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.897
TRIAL IN THE US WE HAVE THE

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.031
URGENCY THAT IS RAISED BY THIS

00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:37.467
INITIATIVE.

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:38.969
AND IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR THAT

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:39.970
THAT THE POSITION OF THE

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:40.537
PROPONENTS IS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.539
INCONSISTENT.

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:44.708
THE THE PRIVATE AND THOSE

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:45.809
INDUSTRIES SPENT A DECADE

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:46.676
ARGUING THAT THEY HAVE NO

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.478
OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OFF DUTY

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:50.180
REST NO BREAKS.

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:51.748
IF THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO DO

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.016
SO THEN THERE'S NO PURPOSE TO

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.251
THIS INITIATIVE IF THEY DO HAVE

00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:55.585
AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO THEN THE

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.788
INITIATIVE IS MAINLY HERE TO FOR

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:58.288
THEM TO AVOID THEIR OWN

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.390
LIABILITY.

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.193
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.761
WE DISAGREE WITH THE LA WAS

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.830
ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:07.731
MONETARY BENEFIT TO COUNTIES

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.166
BECAUSE WE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.700
BELIEVE THAT THAT.

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:12.369
CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED IN PRACTICE

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.937
WE THINK THAT.

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.705
THESE ARE COSTS THAT.

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.240
HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED AND WILL

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:21.411
CONTINUE TO EXIST AND THEY AND

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.547
THE BASICALLY IF IF AMHERST

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.881
CORRECT THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:26.016
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BREAKS UNDER

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.584
THE CURRENT LAW.

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.952
THEN THERE WILL BE NO FINANCIAL

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:29.519
IMPACT OF THIS INITIATIVE IT

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.555
WILL DO NOTHING.

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.557
IF I AM ARE IS CURRENTLY IN

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.058
VIOLATION OF THE WAGE ORDERS.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.660
AND THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.228
THAT.

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.229
THERE IS UP --

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:41.198
SECTION EIGHT EIGHT NINE OF THIS

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.867
INITIATIVE CREATES A

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:44.801
PROPORTIONATELY IN A RETROACTIVE

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:46.736
LIABILITY SHIELD.

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.472
AND IT'S IT'S QUITE EXPLICIT

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:49.739
ABOUT IT'S IN TOWN IT'S NOT

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:50.640
CLEAR WHETHER THAT WOULD BE

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:51.708
ENFORCEABLE AND IT WOULD BE THE

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.643
SOURCE OF LITIGATION.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.845
BUT IF AMHERST CURRENTLY A

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:56.413
VIOLATION OF THE WAGE ORDER AND

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.581
THAT RETROACTIVE LIABILITY

00:51:57.647 --> 00:52:00.283
SHIELDS ENFORCEABLE. TEN AM ARE

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.485
WOULD BENEFIT AM ARE RECEIVABLE

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.552
WINDFALL THAT IS ESSENTIALLY

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.554
DERIVED FROM THE EARNED WAGES OF

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:07.390
THE EMMAUS WORKERS.

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.626
NOW THESE ARE RELATIVELY LOW

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:10.794
PAID WORKERS AND CRITICAL HIGH

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.929
STRESS JOBS.

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.664
THE USER PEOPLE THAT DESERVE

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:16.132
TIME OFF TO REST AND RECOVER

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:17.934
FROM IT CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.537
PROFESSIONS.

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:21.771
AND WE FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE THAT

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:22.739
EMS WORKERS SHOULD RECEIVE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:23.874
IMPROVE TRAINING AND IMPROVE

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.342
MENTAL HEALTH CARE WE SIMPLY

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:26.409
DON'T THINK THAT.

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.878
CAMERAS UNILATERAL INITIATIVE IS

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.679
THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT.

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:30.213
THANK YOU I DON'T TAKE ANY

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.849
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:33.183
I THINK YOU --

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.951
STROKE.

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.820
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THURMOND

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.588
AND SENATOR LARA ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.389
KALRA JOSH WILL GO WITH THE

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:41.157
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:42.592
COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES OF

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.994
CHINA TO REHASH ANYTHING THAT MY

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.728
COLLEAGUE COLLEAGUES HAVE

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.596
COVERED.

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:47.664
I WILL SAY THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:48.465
THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:49.833
MEASURE AND MARK DIDN'T SEE FIT

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.202
TO COME A SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.403
THEIR OWN INITIATIVE I THINK MY

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.504
COLLEAGUE COVERED THAT THIS IS

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.872
REALLY JUST AN ATTEMPT.

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:57.340
A VERY CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:58.675
RELIEVE THEMSELVES OF DECADES OF

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.210
LIABILITY --

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:01.545
THE LA O. CALLED IT A LONG

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.346
STANDING PRACTICE --

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:05.348
MR MCKEE LEE SAID IT WAS A FIVE

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:07.484
DECADE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.552
AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.754
ISN'T THE NEW COSTS REFERRED TO

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.755
BY THE LA JOH.

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.189
THESE OF WAGES THAT BEEN STOLEN

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:16.293
FROM EMPLOYEES OVER DECADES AND

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.728
SO THE APPROACH THAT THIS IS

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:19.362
GOING TO CREATE SOME NEW COSTS

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:19.896
FOR THE COMPANIES ARE FOR

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:22.165
COUNTIES MISGUIDED BECAUSE THIS

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.833
IS REALLY JUST AN ATTEMPT. TO

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.435
RELIEVE LIABILITY FOR THESE

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.803
COMPANIES FOR NOT PAYING THEIR

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.371
EMPLOYEES.

00:53:28.438 --> 00:53:30.407
OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:31.541
AND IT THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.709
ASPECT OF THIS AND THEY'RE

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:35.579
TRYING TO HIDE IT BY PROVIDING.

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.547
THE SOME BENEFITS --

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.249
THAT COULD ARGUE PROVIDED UNDER

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.750
CONTRACTS IN THAT WERE PROPOSED

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.052
IN LEGISLATION THAT WE GOT FOR

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:43.219
LAST YEAR.

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.421
A AND BECAUSE OF THAT WHEN

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.122
OPPOSITION.

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:48.158
NOT I WILL ALSO SAY --

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:50.126
THAT WE APPRECIATE THE APPROACH

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.294

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:56.533
ANSWER.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.968
THANK YOU ARE TRYING TO THE

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.035
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:02.639
THERE ARE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:03.974
A SEEN NONE --

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.842
WE WILL HEAR OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.377
IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC TESTIMONY

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:08.044
ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU --

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:19.189
TO THE WITNESSES.

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:19.990
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UMRIGAR

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.791

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:23.426
EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION.

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.861
AGREE WITH --

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:26.396
WITH THEIR OPPONENTS SAID HERE

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:27.397
ARTERIES WERE INVOLVED IN THAT

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:28.798
JUSTICE DECISION AND AGREED THAT

00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:30.800
IT WAS NOT A CHANGE IN LAW AND

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:31.067
THAT -- WE

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.602
THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.437
PROBLEMATIC THAT THESE BALLOT

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.272
