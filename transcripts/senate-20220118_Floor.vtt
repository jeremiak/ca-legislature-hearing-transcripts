00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.639
OUT. SHE ACCEPTED THE

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.141
REAPPOINTMENT THE CHALLENGES

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.276

FOR THE AUTHORED THAT BECAUSE OF

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:17.982
THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THE VALLEY

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.450
DIDN'T HAVE A MICROPHONE UP I

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:20.651
DIDN'T HEAR WHETHER IT'S THE

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:22.753
SAME QUESTION SO IF IT IS YOU

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.822
DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I WAS

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.123
CONCERNED USUALLY THERE IS AN

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.658
APPEAL PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.260
THE- COULD NOBLE INTENTION OF

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.628
THIS BILL SOUTH FUNDING

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.196
QUESTIONS BUT I DO THINK A

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:34.131
PROCESS OF FULL VERY IMPORTANT.

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.900
IN TERMS OF TRUST IN AN AGENCY

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.668
WHEN HAVE SPECIFICALLY A

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:38.936
BUREAUCRACY AND THEY GET TO

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:41.138
LEVEL THE PINES AND THEY'LL FIND

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:43.007
THAT DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.042
OUT INTENTIONALLY VIOLATED LIKE

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.411
THE BAD ACTORS DO BUT NOT HAVING

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:50.147
AN APPEAL PROCESS WHEN YOU HAVE

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.883
A BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS THAT THEY

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.718
HAVE TO GO THROUGH IF TROUBLING.

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.119
SO IS THERE A REASON THERE IS

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:59.156
NOT AN APPEAL PROCESS AND IF YOU

00:35:59.223 --> 00:35:59.857
ALREADY ANSWERED THAT I

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:00.725
APOLOGIZE. NO WE DIDN'T WE

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.693
ACTUALLY INTO IT I MEAN WHAT I

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.728
MEAN BECAUSE BROADLY SPEAKING IT

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.763
IS. AS I SAY WE WERE ABLE TO

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.131
SATISFY THE YOU KNOW THE COURT

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.033
CONCERNS OF OUR FRIENDS IN

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.602
INDUSTRY YOU. WORK IN THE SPACE.

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.737
BOB YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.605
OBVIOUSLY YEAH THE DGSE HASTERT

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.140
THERE THERE'S A PRETTY STRICT

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.542
SET OF THE MINISTER OF OP

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.010
PROCEDURES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:21.279
TO FOLLOW- BEFORE. I

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:22.613
IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.384

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.067
THERE WILL BE A FEW ACTORS OUT

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.469
THERE THAT WILL RUN THE PROCESS

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.971
OUT. AND AND IF IT EVER MEMBERS

THAT THE THAT THAT THAT THE

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.114
PLAYERS WHO ARE BEING REGULATED

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.183

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.732
WHAT BE THE BILL TALKS ABOUT HOW

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.767
THE- DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO-

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.569
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:20.137
ARE THE NATURE OF THE

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:21.005
CIRCUMSTANCES THE EXTENT OF THE

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.873
VIOLATION HISTORY OF PREVIOUS

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.676
VIOLATIONS. ON THE VIOLATOR'S

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.778
ABILITY TO PAY THE PENALTY- THE

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:28.779
DETERRENT EFFECT OF THE

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.615
PENALTIES ARE ALL THINGS OF THE

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:31.616
DEPARTMENTS TO TAKE INTO

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.951
ACCOUNT. IN MAKING THIS

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.453
DECISION. I HAD. YOU KNOW

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.754
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE IF THEY WERE

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.122
INTERACTING IN SOME KIND OF

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:39.090
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS MANNER

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.925
THERE'D BE A WAY. TO HOLD THEM

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:42.760
ACCOUNTABLE THAT THIS WOULD BE

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.028
SOMETHING THAT WE YEAH THAT THAT

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.930
THAT THAT THAT. THAT THAT COULD

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.031
BE ADDRESS ANOTHER WAY BUT I

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.100
GUESS I WANTED BUT I DON'T WANT

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:51.135
TO HAVE HAPPEN. IS NOW GO

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.003
ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS WHERE EVERY

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.204
GROUP KNOWS THAT THEY CAN JUST.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.806
APPEAL ARE WHEN IT WHEN THERE'S

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:56.874
BEEN A WISE DECISION MADE BY THE

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.010
BY THE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE

00:37:59.076 --> 00:37:59.944
SUDDEN WE'RE TWENTY YEARS LATER

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:01.612
WHENEVER TWO DECADES AND- AND

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.148
ONCE AGAIN THERE'S NOT A SINGLE

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.316
THING IS HAPPENING TO THE GREEN

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:06.517
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. I THANK YOU

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.586
FOR THEIR DOUBTS ON MY OWN TIME-

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.655
COLLEAGUES I. BECOME MORE MORE

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:13.057
TROUBLED WITH THE AMOUNT. OF THE

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.692
THIRTY THAT'S DELEGATED FROM.

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.495
OUR LEGISLATIVE BODY AND I THINK

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.630
SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN. A

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.599
PROPOSED REGULATIONS OF A

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.701
PROCESS THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:25.469
IN A DOZEN BECOME DISCRETIONARY

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:26.871
ON THE PART OF A VERY LARGE

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:29.140
BUREAUCRACY. WHO HAVE.

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:30.741
INCREDIBLE AUTHORITY TO FOR TO

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:34.345
FIND. AN INDIVIDUAL. COMPANY OR-

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.480
WHOEVER FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:37.982
DOLLARS A DAY. SO WITHOUT AN

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:41.218
APPEAL PROCESS. OF FOR. SOMEONE

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.920
WHO'S MADE OF SOME SORT OF A

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:43.754
LAFAYETTE AND MINISTRY TO

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:46.223
MISTAKE. IT FOR A VERY TROUBLING

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.591
SO I THINK WHAT I'LL DO TODAY

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.927
BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT THE

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:52.797
INTENT HERE IS VERY. IMPORTANT

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.965
THAT WITHOUT SOME UNDERSTANDING

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:55.966
OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.768
PROCESS C. AS IN IT. THE FAIR

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:00.204
ENOUGH THAT'S BUILT INTO THAT-

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.205
I'D GET ABSTAINED TODAY UNTIL I

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:05.276
CAN TAKE. A LITTLE CLOSER LOOK

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.243
AT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.145
ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:13.884
ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR KABIR.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.753
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I HAD NO

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.721
INTENTION OF STANDING UP AND

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:19.957
SPEAKING TODAY BUT- I JUST WANT

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.993
TO TALK REAL BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.162
REASON THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:29.100
COUNCIL WAS SET UP BECAUSE- I

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.168
WHILE I AGREE THAT IN MANY

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:33.204
INSTANCES I GET CONCERNED WITH

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.139
THE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY THAT WE

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:38.209
GIVE TO OUR REGULATORY. ENTITIES

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:40.845
I'M PRETTY MUCH UNFETTERED TO

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.379
ADOPT REGULATIONS AND THEN TO

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:44.081
IMPOSE THEM I DO GET CONCERNED

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:45.716
ABOUT THAT AT TIMES THIS

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.651
SITUATION IS REALLY DIFFERENT

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.019
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IS

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:52.289
LOOKING AT AND ANALYZING

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:55.559
CHEMICALS THAT WHEN PRODUCED

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:59.430
INTO A PRODUCT ARE DETRIMENTAL

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.865
TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.600
EITHER OF CHILDREN OR PEOPLE IN

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:03.901
THE COMMUNITY AND THE REASON

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.302
THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:07.304
WAS SET UP IN THE FIRST PLACE SO

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:08.773
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:10.107
CONCERNED ABOUT INADVERTENT

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:12.409
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES THAT'S

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:13.878
JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN THIS

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:16.580
INSTANCE IT JUST ISN'T YOU KNOW

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.815
WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN YOUR

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:19.083
PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.820
HAS. CANCEROUS IMPACTS OR CAN

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:26.123
CAUSE OTHER DISRUPTION OF THE-

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.059
OF THE BODILY FUNCTIONS- THAT'S

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.394
WITH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.996
WAS SET UP FOR AND THE REASON IS

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:35.900
BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY. THOSE

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:38.536
THAT THE CHEMICAL ****

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:41.372
COMPOSITIONS WOULD COME TO THE A

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.107
AND I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AT THE

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.842
TIME SO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.845
AND WE WERE ASKED TO DETERMINE

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.714
WHETHER WE SHOULD BAN THE USE OF

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.850
THAT PARTICULAR CHEMICAL IN A

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:55.553
PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND I NEVER

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.454
SAT ON ANY OF THE COMMITTEES.

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.023
THAT DID THE REVIEW OF THESE

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.891
CHEMICALS AND YET THE BILL WOULD

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.027
COME TO THE FLOOR AND I'D HAVE

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.228
TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BAN THEM

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.129
PERMANENTLY FROM ANY PRODUCT

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.530
THAT WOULD COME INTO CALIFORNIA.

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:08.232
IT WAS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.734
TASK AND IT REQUIRED US TO KNOW

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.369
SOME PRETTY SOPHISTICATED

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.238
SCIENCE INFORMATION WHICH IS WHY

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.006
IT'S AT THE CHEMISTRY COUNCIL

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.808
WAIT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED A

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:20.444
COUNCIL. OF EXPERTS THEY COULD

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.613
LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION AND

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.948
MAKE THE DECISION AND NOT HAVE

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.850
IT COME TO THE FLOOR EVERY

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.885
SINGLE- TIME THAT THERE WAS A

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.553
CONCERN ABOUT CHEMICALS SO I'M

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.522
GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL I AM

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.224
APPALLED THAT IN TEN YEARS

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.592
THERE'S BEEN NO ADMINISTRATIVE

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:38.295
ACTION TAKEN- EIGHT IT SAYS TO

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.865
ME THERE'S A PROBLEM- HOPEFULLY.

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.466
THIS WILL HELP TO RESOLVE SOME

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:44.134
OF THAT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.669
BUT- BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:48.339
TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:49.006
THAT THAT IF. IF A PRODUCT GETS

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.108
INTO PRODUCTION AND COMES TO THE

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.243
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.677
PROTECTING- ARE RESIDENTS SINCE

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:56.247
I WANT TO APPLY- MY GOOD

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.815
SENATOR- FOM SOUTHERN

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.450
CALIFORNIA I THINK HE'S DONE A

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.751
GREAT JOB ON THIS HE WORKS

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.753
REALLY HARD ON THESE AND THE

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.622
FACT THAT THERE ISN'T. A GREAT

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:07.024
OPPOSITION FROM ON THE THOSE

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.359
THAT ARE REGULATED INDICATES

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:09.627
THAT THERE'S A SWEET SPOT HERE

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:13.030
AND I WANT TO ASK THAT YOU VOTE

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.064
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:16.100
YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.301
DEBATE ON THE SIDE ON SENATOR

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:20.337
BACK. THANKS I JUST WANTED TO

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.906
TALK VERY BRIEFLY I TRY FIRST

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:24.375
ACTIVISM EVER WAS ON THE TOXIC

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:24.842
USE REDUCTION ACT IN

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.744
MASSACHUSETTS BUT WHEN I WAS IN

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.312

pTHE COMMUTER RIGHT TO KNOW ACT

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.815
SO I DID NOT KNOW ACTUALLY. AT

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:32.850
ALL REALLY ABOUT THE GREEN

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:33.817
CHEMISTRY COUNCIL THE WORK HAD

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.287
BEEN DONE BUT I THINK THE

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.454
EVIDENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.255
TWELVE YEARS. WITHOUT A

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:40.457
ENFORCEMENT ACTION OR TO HAVE

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.892

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:44.328
NEED TO MAKE THESE CHANGES AND I

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:45.562
WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHORED I'M

DAX IN THE MOVIE THIS IS PART OF

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.795
MISSISSIPPI IT'S REALLY FAILED

IN ILLINOIS' AND- THE FILM THAT

IN ILLINOIS' BUT IT CAME TO A

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.002
POINT IN THE MOVIE WHERE THEY

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.204
DID NEED TO GO SOUTH. BECAUSE

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.305

HAD YET AGAIN ON SATURDAY. I

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:49.143
THINK THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.712
THINGS TO NOTE HERE. ONE WHICH

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.948
IS SURPRISING AND ONE WHICH IS

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.350
NOT. THE FIRST THE PART THAT'S

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:59.687
NOT SURPRISING. THAT THE WAY

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:01.622
THAT THE ATTACKER GOT INTO THE

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:04.091
SYNAGOGUE. WAS BECAUSE THE RABBI

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.194
INVITED HIM AND BECAUSE HE

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.062
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN DISTRESS

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:11.165
AND IN NEED. THE RABBI SHOWED

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:13.201
WILL RECALL TO CRIMINAL LAW I'M

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:14.569
HEALING THE WORLD WHICH IS A

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:17.038
CORE PILLAR OF JUDAISM. THAT WE

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.774
MUST BE THERE FOR OUR FELLOW

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:21.843
HUMAN BEINGS. AND THE ROB I

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:25.012
INVITED HIM AND EVEN THOUGH HE

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.781
WAS A PERSON WHO WAS POTENTIALLY

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:29.784
GOING TO KILL THE RABBI AND

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:32.220
MEMBERS OF HIS CONGREGATION. THE

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:35.022
PART THAT IS SURPRISING IS THE

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:37.658
WAY THAT THIS ENDED YES THANK

THERE AND FOR PRIORITIZING. OUR

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:43.931
COMMUNITY. IT ENDED BECAUSE THE

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.033
RABBI AND ONE OF THE CONGREGANTS

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.603
HAD SECURITY TRAINING. AND SO

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.404
THEY WERE ABLE TO FREE

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:53.541

MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF A RABBI.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:23.838
THE REASON THIS RABBI AND ONE OF

THE CONGREGANTS HAD SECURITY

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.008

SOCIAL MEDIA WE SEE IN OUR

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:40.908
POLITICS TODAY IN THIS COUNTRY

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.309
AND AROUND THE WORLD. WHERE

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:47.782
POLITICAL SYSTEM FEEL LIBERATED

WE INCREASED AT THE FIFTY

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.702
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT IS IT

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:10.671
