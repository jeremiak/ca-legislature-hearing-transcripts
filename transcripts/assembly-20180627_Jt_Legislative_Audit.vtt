00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.033
FINDINGS WE HAD IN THE AUDIT

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.501
REPORT BUT CLEARLY THERE WERE

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:24.769
THREE KEY AREAS.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:27.038
THAT WILL GO OVER TODAY ONE IS

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.272
WITH RESPECT TO DISRUPTED

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.341
SERVICES FOR FAMILIES --

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.143
BECAUSE OF TERMINATION NOTICES

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.378
WILL GET INTO SPECIFICS MISTER

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.880
LEE WILL DISCUSS THAT AREA --

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:37.515
ISSUES RELATED TO LATE PAYMENTS

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.350
TO PROVIDERS WHICH REALLY CAUSED

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.152
HARDSHIP AND THEN A DECISION TO

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:42.787
END A PRESCHOOL CONTRACT TO

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.089
AVOID SCRUTINY OF OTHER

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.090
CONTRACTS.

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.191
ALSO THAT'S ONE KEY AREA THE

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:48.793
NEXT AREA IS CONTRACTING

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.695

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:52.296
EDUCATION'S OVERSIGHT --

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:52.897
IN FACT NOT DETECTING MANY OF

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:57.502
THE MISTER HOOPER WILL DISCUSS

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:59.604
SOME OF THE TESTING WE DID WITH

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.339
RESPECT TO EXPENDITURES IN OUR

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:02.840
DETERMINATION THAT SOME OF THOSE

WERE.

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.842
NOT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.177
CONTRACTS --

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:08.012
THE FACT THAT FORESEES WAS NOT

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.313
COMPLYING WITH VARIOUS

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.915

AND SELF EVALUATION --

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:19.824
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:22.293
COMMENTS FROM THE BOARD STAFF

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.027

AND ASSESSING THEIR PROGRAMS SO

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.765
THAT'S A SECOND AREA THE THIRD

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.333
AREA MISTER HOOPER AGAIN WILL

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.402

RETIREMENT PLANS.

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:33.371
AND SOME IN OUR VIEW VERY

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.239
QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS MADE WITH

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:36.607

RETIREMENT PLANS INVESTING FUNDS

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.311
IN VERY RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:41.846
WHICH WAS REALLY NOT IN THE BEST

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:42.847
INTERESTS OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:43.181

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.349
AND THOSE PARTICULAR PLANS THE

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.118

THE PROJECT MANAGER --

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.009

FAMILIES --

00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:59.757
SPECIFICALLY A WE FOUND THAT

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:02.159
FORESEES GAVE --

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.394
THE UNREASONABLE DEADLINES TO

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:04.362
FAMILIES FOR RESPONDING TO

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:06.464
TERMINATION NOTICES --

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.032
THE THE THE TERMINATION NOTICES

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.500
REFER TO AS THE NOTICE OF ACTION

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:10.868
IT'S IT'S A COMMUNICATION METHOD

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:13.037
BY WHICH FORESEES COMMUNICATES

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.405
WITH IT'S FAMILIES REGARDING

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:16.140
CHANGES IN SERVICES --

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.375
SOME OF THOSE NOTIFICATIONS CAN

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.910
BE IN THE FORM OF TERMINATION OF

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:20.578
SERVICES A REDUCTION IN SERVICES

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:21.879
DEPENDING UPON.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:22.980
THE FAMILY'S.

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:26.751
FACTORS.

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:28.352
WE FOUND THAT --

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.187
FORESEE STAFF HAD INCORRECTLY

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:31.989
RECORDED NOTIFICATION DATES

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.925
WITHIN ITS CHILD CARE DATABASE

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.992
SYSTEM --

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.127
WHICH IS USED TO GENERATE THESE

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:37.995
NOTICES --

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:39.897
FOR ABOUT 15% OF THOSE NOTIFIED

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.533
NOTICES DURING THAT FISCAL YEARS

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.801

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:44.368
SEVENTEEN THE PERIOD THAT WE

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.102
LOOKED OUT.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.171
WE FOUND THAT FIFTY BUT OVER 15%

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.773
HAD BEEN --

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.575
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE REFER TO THE

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.009
REPORT IS BEING BACKDATED --

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:53.344
THE DATES THAT WERE LISTED AS

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.846
NOTIFICATION DATES WERE CHANGED

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.181
TO EARLIER DATES AND THAT HAD

00:36:57.248 --> 00:36:59.083
THE EFFECT OF CREATING A

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.484
DEADLINE DATE FOR FAMILIES TO

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.219

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:04.355
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:05.723
AS RESULT OF THAT FAMILIES WERE

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.391
NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:08.726
NOTICES --

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.294
IN A TIMELY MANNER IN SOME CASES

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.329
FAMILIES WERE ONLY GIVEN A FEW

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:12.830
DAYS TO RESPOND INSTEAD OF THE

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.099

FORESEES POLICY IN FOURTEEN DAYS

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:20.004
BEING THE STATE'S OF STATE

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:25.376
I IN FACT IN SOME CASES WE HAD

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.345
IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR RESEARCH

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.347
OF THE DATABASE OF OVER FOUR

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:30.915
HUNDRED INSTANCES DURING THAT

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.683
TWO YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.652

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.521
DUE DATES T

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:38.990
COLLAPSED AND SO THEY WERE

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:41.125
ESSENTIALLY GIVEN A NOTIFICATION

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:43.127
THAT THEY COULD RESPOND TO

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:43.728
BECAUSE THE TIME THAT ALREADY

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.162
EXPIRED --

00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:47.231
IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.833
DETERMINE THE EFFECT WE LOOKED

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:52.003
AT CASE FILES FOR A SELECTION OF

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.771
TEN NOTICES FOR WHICH THE US

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:54.739
SERVICES WERE --

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:56.641
SUGGEST TO BE TERMINATED AND WE

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:57.875
FOUND IN SOME CASES --

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:58.743
THE SERVICES ENDED UP NOT BEING

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.545
TERMINATED.

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.581
CASES IN WHICH SERVICES WERE

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:04.582
ACTUALLY TERMINATED --

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:05.516
THUS LEAVING FAMILY WITHOUT

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:08.152
SERVICES.

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.720
WE INQUIRED OF FORESEES AS TO

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:10.788
THE REASON WHY THE THE

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.356
SPECTATING IT OCCURRED IN THE

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:13.958

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.795
THOSE NOTICES NOR COULD THEY

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.430
PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION AS TO ANY

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.199
TYPE OF RATIONALE AS TO WHY A

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.135
DATE WOULD NEED TO BE BACK DATED.

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.536
OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR FOR

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.338
SEIZE.

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:28.639
TO ESSENTIALLY I ESTABLISH

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.074
CONTROL WITHIN ITS DATABASE

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.043

AND ENSURE THAT THE SPECTATING

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.927
DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE --

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.195
IT AS IT IS IT IS STOCK

THAT HAD UNREASONABLE RESPONSE

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.722
PERIODS WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED

SEPARATELY FOR EACH PROGRAM.

00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.553
AND IT WAS NOT CONSISTENTLY

DETERMINATIONS OF COMPLIANCE SO

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:06.790
WE RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.607
TO ADDRESS THIS WE RECOMMENDED

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.775
THAT EDUCATION SHOULD ADOPT

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:25.876

ITS EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES.

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.247
WE RECOMMENDED THAT FORESEES

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.376
RECOMMENDED THAT EDUCATION

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.429
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MOST

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.397
SERIOUS THING HERE AND THE MOST

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.732
FRANKLY OF RAGES.

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.367

LINE.

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.025
IT'S UNINTENTIONAL ACTION THAT

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:44.060
IS NOT NEGLIGENCE --

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:47.330
AND CERTAINLY NOT INADVERTENT.

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.198
YOU KNOW --

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:50.133
OUR CORE VALUES IN THE AIR FORCE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.135
WERE INTEGRITY FIRST --

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.537
SERVICE BEFORE SELF AND

WHAT ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN?

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:13.790
WITH RESPECT TO THOSE

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.825
INDIVIDUALS.

AS YOU'VE INDICATED --

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.837
RESULT IN A LOSS OF SERVICE.

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.906

MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS SUBJECT AND

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:36.813
I DO SO COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.113
[inaudible]

WHILE WE WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH

00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:07.677
DIRECT EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.546
FORESEES DID THAT WE WE DID NOTE

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:10.914
THAT -- ONE

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.515
POTENTIAL REASON FOR DOING THAT

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.217
WAS TO MAKE FOUR SEES AS A

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.885
CONTRACTOR LOOK MORE COMPLIANT

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:17.754

WAS BEHIND ON PROCESSING THE

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:21.791

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:24.594
USING EARLIER DATES IT MAY --

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:26.363

THE REPORT --

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.840
ASIDE FROM THAT --

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:37.874
THERE MAY BE OTHER MOTIVATIONS

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.275
THAT WE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.977
ANY TYPE OF CLARIFICATION ON

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.846
FORESEES AS TO WHY THEY DID IT.

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:43.947

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:53.857
PRIMARILY ON ADDRESSING THE THE

00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.458

WERE AFFECTED THAT THEY WERE IN

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:01.798
THE PROCESS OF RESEARCHING THAT

AREA BACK DATING WOULD BE VERY

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:47.410
LIMITED OF WE HAD THE ABILITY

I EDUCATION AS PART OF ITS --

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.830
COMPLIANCE REVIEWS --

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.364
OUR ON SITE AND FOCUS IN ON A

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.833
NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT AREAS

FINISHES SUCH AS THIS THEY

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.442
INFORMED US THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE --

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.046
IT DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.214
FOR THE REVIEW TO BE GOING AT

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.116
THAT LEVEL OF DEATH THAT WE DID

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.383
ON OUR ON OUR AUDIT --

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.384
AND THEY WOULD THAT WOULD

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.252
REQUIRE SOME TECHNICAL

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:30.687
EXPERIENCE FOR WHICH THE

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.722
CONSULTANT AND STAFF ASSIGNED TO

TO TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED SOON TURNS

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:40.130
OF THEIR INTERNAL --

OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS.

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:44.067
UM THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE A

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:46.469
DEFICIENCY THAT.

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:47.203
NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED IS THAT

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.539
TRUE.

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.274
I THINK WE WE WE WE LOOKED AT IT

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.076
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CERTAINLY

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.677
IF THIS THAT THIS OCCURRED --

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:55.979
HERE AT FOUR SEIZE IT COULD

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.747
POTENTIALLY OCCUR --

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:58.381
ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE STATE WITH

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:01.217
OTHER CONTRACT. TO INFORM THEM

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:04.521
OF OUR AS THEY WERE AWARE OF OF

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:06.422
THE ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED --

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.958
INFORMS US THAT THEY THAT THERE

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.226
AS PART OF THEIR REVIEW THAT

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.661
THAT ISN'T PART OF THEIR

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.963
STANDARD REVIEW ALTHOUGH I WOULD

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.498
DEFER TO THEM IN TERMS OF YES

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.399
GUESSING HOW THEY MIGHT.

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:18.902
APPROACH THAT [inaudible]

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:21.204
WHEN --

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.939
THERE WAS TWO OTHER AUDITS OF

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.741
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ON

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:25.975
DIFFERENT SUBJECTS CALIFORNIA

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.710
PART EDUCATION.

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.813
BEFORE THIS --

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.548
ONE RICK WHAT A RELATED TO THIS

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:34.584
SUBJECT --

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.519
IN THOSE AUDITS THERE WAS --

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.521
AGAIN.

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:40.824
A CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS AN

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:41.991
AD HOC GROUPS --

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:46.329
OR INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT.

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:50.767
THE IN THOSE ON IT SO --

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.702
IN TERMS OF THIS AUDIT.

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.704
ARE THEY FULLY COMPLYING.

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.840
WITH THIS AUDIT.

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.508
OR YOU SAID EARLIER THAT YOU'RE

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:00.109
NOT.

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.644
FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:03.546
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT.

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:04.414
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AREAS

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.516
THAT THEY'RE NOT.

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.818
FULLY COMPLYING WITH THIS AUDIT.

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.753
SO I UNDERSTAND THEM --

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.890
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY --

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.258
FORESEES IS INDICATED THAT THEY

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.960
AGREE WITH EACH OF THE

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.561
RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:19.729
AND THEY'RE WORKING ON IT

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.331
EDUCATION --

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:23.032
GREECE WITH FOUR OUT OF THE SIX

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.835
RECOMMENDATIONS IN A REPORT --

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:30.106
THE DISAGREE WITH US ARM --

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:35.078
ARE THE ISSUE OF THEY DISAGREE

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:38.548
WITH US ON THE ISSUE OF A HAVING

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:39.449
BOARD.

PROCESSES AND ON EDUCATION

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.321
BELIEVES THAT ITS INTERPRETATION

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:46.422
OF ITS OWN CONTRACTS IS

IT PERTAINS TO FORESEES --

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:01.977
THAT THAT EDUCATION FOCUSING ON

THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS AS WELL

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.514
AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF ITS

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.416

BE ISSUED SOON --

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.319
IN TERMS OF FOCUSING IN ON THOSE

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.855
AREAS WHAT WE WHAT WE

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.323
RECOMMENDED IN OUR REPORT AS IT

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.925
RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.093
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF WAS.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.329
TO LOOK AT THE TYPES OF ISSUES

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.198
IDENTIFIED.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.899
IN THOSE AND CONSIDER FACTOR IN

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.868
THOSE IN AS YOU LOOK AT OTHER

CONTRACTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.404
SO I THINK THAT THE THAT THOSE

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.972
TYPES OF FACTORS SHOULD BE

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:31.140
CONSIDERED IN --

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.642
WHEN IT DOES NOT COME TIME TO

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.177
LOOK AT A PARTICULAR CONTRACT

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:36.312
FOR RENEWAL LOOKING AT THE

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.813
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THE

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.547
PROGRAMMATIC AN OPERATIONAL

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.349
SIDES I THINK A REPORT INCLUDES

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:41.684
A NUMBER OF?

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.552
I DIFFERENT AREAS START TO CALL

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:44.520
TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION AS

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.222

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:47.456
EDUCATION HAS INDICATED THAT

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.357
IT'S PERFORMANCE AUDIT.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.025
IS ALSO COVERING SIMILAR AREAS

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.560
SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.062
INFORMATION COULD BE UTILIZED IN

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.930
TERMS OF THE DECISION PROCESS

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.131
FOR RENEWAL.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.067
WHEN THEY COMPLETE THAT

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.436
PERFORMANCE OUGHT --

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.104

ANY OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT --

IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WILL DO

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.955
THAT YET YES TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.323
THERE IS OVERLAP IN FACT THERE

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.458

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.493
THAT THAT. FOR WHICH EDUCATION

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.362

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:27.496
RESULT OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ON

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:27.830
IT.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.598
THEY WILL THEN CONSIDER --

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.600
WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES THAT NEED

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.701
TO BE MADE BASED ON A

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.003
RECOMMENDATION SO WE WILL WOULD

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.504
DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT TYPE OF

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.405
CHANGE?

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.606
CERTAINLY OF THEIR PERFORMANCE

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:40.042
AUDIT ADDRESSED ANYTHING ELSE

AS WELL IN TERMS OF ANY ACTION

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.283
FOUR SEASONS TAKING AS A RESULT

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.150
OF THAT ON IT [inaudible]

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:51.587
I THINK.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.555
SENATOR OF IF I MIGHT ADD.

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.189
UP COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.357
COMMENTS RELATED TO THEIR

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:57.293
CONTRACT EDUCATIONS OVERSIGHT OF

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.429
CONTRACTS --

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.664
WE DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.299
THEY DO RELY ON THAT ON

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.800
INDEPENDENT AUDITS THAT ARE DONE

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.635
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO LOOKING

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.304
AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.139
THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THAT OR

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:11.373
I PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE AND

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.441
BASED ON WHAT WE SAY IN THE

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.809
REPORT IS A LOT OF TIMES AN

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.878
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR THAT'S HIRED

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:16.178
BY.

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:19.148
A NONPROFIT IS DOING A VERY HIGH

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.716
LEVEL REVIEW.

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.151
OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:23.452
THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE BIG

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.187
DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND MAY NOT

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:26.822
NECESSARILY DRILL DOWN TO THE

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.924
SMALLER AMOUNTS LIKE WE IDENTIFY

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:31.160
WHAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE DOING.

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.828
IS LOOKING AT THOSE INDEPENDENT

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.163
AUDITS AND THEN DETERMINING

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.598
WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.132
DRILL DOWN DEEPER PART OF A A

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.701
DETERMINATION WOULD BE.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:41.036
A RISK ASSESSMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:42.871
AS MISTER LEE INDICATED THERE

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.640
WAS A PRESCHOOL CONTRACT THAT

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.708
THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:46.709
INTENDED PUT ON CONDITIONAL

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.377
STATUS.

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:49.645
FORESEES DECIDED TO JUST

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.046
TERMINATE THEIR CONTRACT TO

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.948
AVOID THE SCRUTINY THAT THAT

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.283
MEANT ALL OF THEIR CONTRACT

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:55.351
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON CONDITIONAL

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:56.785
STATUS WHICH MEANT MORE

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.220
OVERSIGHT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.188
EDUCATION.

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:01.023
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OR I THINK

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.391
ANY REASONABLE PERSON THAT

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.859
RAISES A RED FLAG THERE

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.094
SOMETHING THAT FORESEES IS

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.396
CONCERNED ABOUT SO IF I WERE THE

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:08.664
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IF IT

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.165
WERE OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE'D SAY

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.333
WE NEED TO GET INTO THIS ENTITY

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.135
AND REALLY DRILL DOWN AND LOOK

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.470
DEEPER.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:16.271
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAD.

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.706
RELATED TO SOME OF THEIR

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.508
CONTRACT MONITORING AS THEY GO

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:20.809
OUT AND THEY LOOK AT SOME OF

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.044
THESE CONTRACTS AND DETERMINE

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.545
THEIR RISK THEY'RE COMPLYING

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:24.813
WITH CERTAIN TERMINOLOGY.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.582
BUT WHEN MY STAFF SAID SHOW ME

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:29.918
THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU USED TO

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:31.420
REACH THAT DETERMINATION THEY

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:32.955
DON'T CAPTURE THAT EVIDENCE NOW

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.757
THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO

EXPLORE SOME OTHER AREAS SO.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.227

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.964

DETERMINE HOW THE PLAN IS GOING

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.333

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.536
CONTRACTORS WERE DOING THAT IN

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.371
PLACE THAT HAD SYSTEM IN PLACE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.873
THE COMMUNICATION EXISTED THAT --

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.274
A CONTACT INFORMATION INCLUDING

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.143

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.377
OUTREACH COULD BE DONE IF

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.314
PROP FOURTH EDUCATION THE FACT

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.449
THAT THERE WERE NO APPEALS

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:15.617
RAISED A RED FLAG IN OUR MIND

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.452
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.654
THAT PROCESS --

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.022
THAT PROCESS CERTAINLY WOULD BE

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.524
BENEFICIAL AND CERTAINLY

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.491
COULDN'T CAUSE ANY HARM FROM

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.025
THAT STANDPOINT OF GREATER

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.727
AWARENESS.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:26.761
I THINK IT THE ACT I THINK

01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:27.395
THAT'S ANOTHER RED FLAGGED THAT

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.797
REALLY CREATES A PRETTY CLEAR

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:30.265
INFERENCE THAT.

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.433
I THE SYSTEM'S NOT WORKING IF

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:32.400
YOU HAVE ZERO APPEALS AND YOU

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:33.134
HAVE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:35.804
TERMINATED AND EDUCATION WAS

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.273
LYING ON AN AGENCY THAT'S

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:39.741
ALREADY SHOWN THAT IS VIOLATING

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.309
ITS OWN POLICIES LET ALONE STATE

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:41.576

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.711
IT.

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.780
BUT UP TO END SO I BUT I MAYBE.

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.015
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT EDUCATION AS

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.750
TO WHETHER THE APPEALS PROCESS

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:49.350

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.419
IT HAS --

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.021
THE END.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:55.557

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.266
IT COULD BECAUSE SO MANY EXOTIC

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:15.701

02:06:19.872 --> 02:06:20.572
DIFFERENT WAR BASED UPON

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:23.976
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY.

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:24.810
SOMEONE ATE THEM UP.

SENATE THEY'RE NOT AN APPEAL.

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.862

THOSE ARE EXCEPTIONS IN THE

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:55.341
POLICY THAT ALLOW --

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:58.277
FOR ó ALLOW FOR A SIDESTEPPING

02:06:58.344 --> 02:06:58.911
THE POLICY [inaudible]

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:01.213
IT.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.848
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT --

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.984
THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS WE DID

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:06.885
THE FULL REVIEW TO DETERMINE THE

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:11.023
EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM THAT WAS --

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:13.859
AND THE HARM TO THE COMMUNITY AS

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:18.397
A RESULT OF THAT. FOR OUR OWN.

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:19.031
BUT BETTER MEET --

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:20.666
THAT BEING SAID.

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:22.167
I WHAT IT APPEARS MAY HAVE

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:24.470
HAPPENED IS.

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:26.638
THAT THERE WAS IN THE CORRECT

I THAT WERE BACKDATED PRINTED

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:40.712
OUT IN A IN A DATABASE IN A

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:41.947
BINDER -- I

SEE THAT I THINK THAT --

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:53.292
MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST.

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:55.627
THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN.

02:08:55.694 --> 02:08:58.397
HOW THEIR SERVICES TERMINATED --

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:00.365
THAT HAD COME TO THAT WEBER

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:01.633
THERE WASN'T AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.000
TIME FOR APPEAL.

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:04.203
AND I WILL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:09:04.269 --> 02:09:05.370
CERTAINLY THE NUMBERS TO LEAST

02:09:05.437 --> 02:09:06.905
AGAIN.

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:08.807
THE DOCUMENTATION IS CRITICAL UP

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:11.877
PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES --

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:12.478
TO DETERMINATION SERVICES TO A

02:09:12.544 --> 02:09:13.412
CHILD [inaudible]

02:09:13.479 --> 02:09:14.780
I'M [inaudible]

02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:16.515
NOW.

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:20.185
IN TERMS OF LOOK AT THE I THINK

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:21.787
OUR CHAIR A PROPERLY SENATE SO

02:09:21.854 --> 02:09:23.188
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT INTEGRITY

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:24.490
AND CULTURE IT ALWAYS WILL

02:09:24.556 --> 02:09:25.791
CONSTRUCT THE TOP.

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:28.227
AND I'M ONE OF THE TROUBLING

02:09:28.293 --> 02:09:30.395
ASPECTS IS THE LACK OF

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:31.430
DOCUMENTATION OF YOU KIND OF

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:33.999
BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:35.567
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT IF

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:37.002
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SHOW TO

02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:38.670
ACTIONS AND OR THROUGH

02:09:38.737 --> 02:09:39.805
DOCUMENTATION.

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:41.874
IS JUST WORDS AND WE KNOW THE

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.942
PRIOR EXACT DIRECTOR SAID THAT I

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:44.476
THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF

02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:45.377
TAXPAYER MONEY [inaudible]

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:48.747
AND THE REASON WHY THE AUDIT

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.849
OCCURRED WAS BECAUSE WORKERS

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:51.483
WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT WAS

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:53.252
HAPPENING.

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.987
AND YET THE THAT TIME AND AGAIN

02:09:55.053 --> 02:09:57.523
WE WERE TOLD BY MANAGEMENT ALL

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:58.557
THE WORKERS ARE LYING JUST ONE

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:00.058
AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO PUT

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:01.426
LEVERAGE FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS ON

02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:02.961
ON ARE NOT YET.

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.062
EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAID WAS

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:05.797
HAPPENING WAS HAPPENING.

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.833
AND SO THE REASON WHY I MENTION

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:10.135
THAT IS WELL FIRST OF ALL.

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:11.503
WERE ANY WORKERS THAT COMPLAINT

02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:13.305
OR RAISED ISSUES FIRED

02:10:13.372 --> 02:10:14.973
TERMINATED REPRIMANDED IN ANY

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.542
WAY HARMED.

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:22.548
BECAUSE THEY CAME FORWARD. TO

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:24.816
THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NO.

02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:25.784
BECAUSE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:27.986
FOUGHT THAT THAT STATEMENT IS IS

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:28.854
STILL.

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:31.056
IF SOMEBODY PROVIDES A COMPLAINT

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.791
AND IS NOT ADDRESS AND IS NOT A

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:34.426
DRESS APPROPRIATELY.

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:35.894
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOUT WE

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:38.063
DAHLE TATE RETALIATED THAT IS A

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:39.531
SOMETHING OF THAT THAT WOULD GO

02:10:39.598 --> 02:10:41.166
TO MY LEVEL.

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:42.901
AND TO GO TO THE LEVEL OF DOES

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:44.503
EXACTLY THAT MAKE YOU BUT YOU

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:46.071
WON'T PRIOR YOU'RE THERE.

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:46.672
AND AND I AND THE REASON I'M

MONTHS AS INTERIM.

02:10:51.643 --> 02:10:53.679
I THINK EUROPE CONSULTING FOR A

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:54.079
FEW MONTHS BEFORE.

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:56.648
BUT ANY LEADER THAT COMES AND IS

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:57.316
GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HECK

02:10:57.382 --> 02:10:58.383

HAPPEN.

02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:00.953
YOU KNOW --

02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:02.120
SUITED YOU TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU

WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PLACE

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:08.660
DID YOU.

02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:09.361
DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT

02:11:09.428 --> 02:11:12.564
YES YES YES --

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:13.565
A YES OR A WEEK WE HAD THE I HAD

02:11:13.632 --> 02:11:15.300
THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE ONE

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:16.969
THING THAT I WAS AS AS A DO I

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:18.403
HAVE AN OPEN DOOR POLICY.

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.871
AND MY RESPONSE THERE'S NO

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:20.439
BECAUSE I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:22.374
PRACTICE I'M GONNA WAIT FOR YOU

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:24.309
TO TELL ME.

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:26.178
THE PROBLEM AYE AYE GOAL TO YOU

02:11:26.245 --> 02:11:28.013
SO IN THAT REGARD WHAT ONE OF MY

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.581
FIRST A OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:31.483
ACTIONS WAS TO ACTUALLY GET TO

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.851
MEET ALL THE STAFF.

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.853
AND TO BE OUT THERE LOOKING AT

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.121
HOW THEY WORK AND WHAT THE

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.889
RESPONSE DID YOU EVER

02:11:37.956 --> 02:11:39.625
CONFIDENTIALLY TALK TO SOME OF

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:40.459
US HAVE A WHAT HAPPENED WERE YOU

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:40.759
EVER HEAR.

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:42.160
ANYONE EVER THREATEN YOU DID

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:44.096
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU TO BACKDATE

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.897
DATA DID YOU EVER DO THAT THE

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:47.065
ABSENCE OF BY ASKING THEIR WITH

02:11:47.132 --> 02:11:48.634
WHEN I WAS THAT I DID HAVE

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:49.401
CONFIDENTIAL.

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:51.003
CONVERSATIONS ON SOME OF THE

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.704
THINGS THAT THEY PERCEIVE OR

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:53.672
HAPPENING IN THOSE WERE PUBLIC

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:55.674
CORRECT DID YOU DID YOU EVER ASK

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:57.042
AND HE THE WORKERS I AB OF I

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:59.044
THINK THAT WE HEARD THAT.

02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:00.779
EMPLOYEES THAT WERE DETERMINED

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:02.180
TO HAVE DONE THE BACKDATING.

02:12:02.247 --> 02:12:04.249
ARE NO LONGER WITH FORESEES.

02:12:04.316 --> 02:12:05.217
BUT SO DOES THE ONES THAT ARE

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:06.685
DOING THE DATA ENTRY.

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:08.553
MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S THE

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.722
WORKERS THAT WERE TERMINATED BUT

02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:11.757
THAT IT WAS A POT MEAN YOU TOOK

02:12:11.823 --> 02:12:13.292
MY THOUSAND WAS A POLICY IN

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.793
PLACE --

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.528
THAT IS DIRECTED FROM A

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:19.398
SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER LEVEL AND

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:20.932
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE WORKERS

02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:22.634
TO FIND OUT IF THAT POLICY WAS

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.403
IN PLACE YOU EVER TALK TO ANYONE

02:12:24.469 --> 02:12:26.438
IN COMP AND CONFIDENCE. TO FIND

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:29.207
OUT IF ANY OF THE WORKERS --

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:29.875
DIE THAT WERE TERMINATED OUR NEW

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.376
OF THIS PRACTICE WERE INSTRUCTED

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:32.377
TO DO SO BY.

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:36.415
A SUPERIOR NOT SPECIFIC FOR THAT

REPORTS ENOUGH AND WORK WITH THE

02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:27.552
CPA'S AND AND GET CLARIFYING

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:28.553
INFORMATION.

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:30.388
SOMETIMES WE DO IDENTIFY COSTS

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:32.290
THAT I NEED TO BE ADJUSTED.

02:25:32.356 --> 02:25:33.724
ON BUT AGAIN THAT IS ONLY ONE

02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:36.527
SOURCE OF INFORMATION --

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.429
CURRENTLY HAS WITH NO TO BE.

02:25:38.496 --> 02:25:39.430
THE AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:40.431
DIVISION IS --

02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:41.899
COMPLETING ITS OWN PERFORMANCE

02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:43.734
AUDIT WHICH IS AN IN DEPTH

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:45.203
PERFORMANCE AUDIT AND WAS

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.437
EXPECTED TO TAKE.

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:48.206
UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME

02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:49.974
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:51.676
ADMINISTRATION OF AND THE CHILD

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:53.111

MARCH TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE

02:25:58.082 --> 02:26:00.251
AREAS THAT WE'RE COVERING OUR

02:26:00.318 --> 02:26:03.254
MARK FISCALLY FOCUSED

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:05.690
ELIGIBILITY GENERAL EXPENDITURES

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:07.158
PAYROLL EXPENDITURES COST

AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:11.696

02:26:11.762 --> 02:26:13.998
RELATED PARTY TYPE TRANSACTIONS.

02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:16.334
SO ON THIS AUDIT WAS INTENDED TO

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.603
TAKE AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME

02:26:18.669 --> 02:26:19.570
BE BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL IN THE

02:26:19.637 --> 02:26:20.338
DEATH OF THE AUDIT.

02:26:20.404 --> 02:26:21.839
HOWEVER IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED

02:26:21.906 --> 02:26:23.975
THAT O PLEADED BEGIN THIS AUDIT

02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:25.176
PRIOR TO SEE.

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:25.910
AUDIT.

02:26:25.977 --> 02:26:27.512
AND ON DURING THE AUDIT THE

02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:29.213
AGENCY WAS EXPERIENCE EXTENSIVE

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.548
REQUEST OF DOCUMENTATION AND

THEIR TIME FROM BOTH OF US AT

02:26:31.516 --> 02:26:34.886
THE SAME TIME SO WE DID SAY HEY

02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:36.254
OKAY WILL TAKE A STEP BACK.

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:37.588
WELL THAT YOU AND WORK WITH THE

02:26:37.655 --> 02:26:39.490
STATE AUDITOR AND THEN WE WILL

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.292
RECONNECT AFTER THAT WHICH WE

02:26:41.359 --> 02:26:42.560
DID AND WHERE IN THAT --

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:43.895
FINAL PROCESSES OF WRAPPING THAT

02:26:43.961 --> 02:26:45.596
UP SO WE DO EXPECT THE REPORT TO

02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:46.464
BE ISSUED.

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:48.766
ON ABOUT SEPTEMBER AND TWENTY

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:50.134
EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL HAVE THOSE

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:50.368
RESULTS.

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:51.369
FORTHCOMING.

02:26:51.435 --> 02:26:53.571
AND SO WITH THAT I WILL TALK

02:26:53.638 --> 02:26:55.206
ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

02:26:55.273 --> 02:26:56.774
SEE A FACE ON IT --

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:57.875
WHAT I'LL TALK ABOUT FIRST OF

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:59.043
THE FOUR THAT WE AGREE WITH AND

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:00.311
AND THE ACTIONS THAT WE ARE

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:02.146
TAKING RELATED TO THOSE AND THEN

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:03.414
I WILL TALK ABOUT THE LAST TWO

02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:04.682
AFTER THAT?

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:08.386
SO AND THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION.

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:11.923
AND THAT WE CONCUR WITH.

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:16.794
PART OF MY LIFE WITH YOU --

02:27:16.861 --> 02:27:18.329
IS AYE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER

02:27:18.396 --> 02:27:19.530
NINE IT'S ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF

02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:21.299
THE AUDIT REPORT.

02:27:21.365 --> 02:27:24.068
SO AND THAT RECOMMENDATION --

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:25.636
REQUIRES THAT DEPARTMENT OF

02:27:25.703 --> 02:27:28.372
EDUCATION TO AND RECALCULATE THE

02:27:28.439 --> 02:27:30.374
REIMBURSABLE COST THREE RELATED

02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:31.876
TO THAT QUESTION COSTS THAT WERE

02:27:31.943 --> 02:27:33.578
IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR.

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:35.213
AND WE WILL DO THAT AND WE WILL

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.881
DO THAT AT THE END OF A OUR IDEA

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:38.516
IS WILD SO WE DO THAT ALL AT ONE

02:27:38.583 --> 02:27:39.317
TIME.

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:40.117
BASED ON WHATEVER THE RESULTS

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:41.953
ARE AT THAT.

02:27:42.019 --> 02:27:42.753
AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:42.987
WILL --

02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:44.388
OCCUR.

02:27:44.455 --> 02:27:46.190
AND THAT THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION

02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:48.059
IS NUMBER TEN ON PAGE THIRTY

02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:49.427
FIVE AT THE REPORT --

02:27:49.493 --> 02:27:51.596
AND THAT ASSETS --

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:52.830
TO CONDUCT ANY FOLLOW REVIEWS OF

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:54.432
FORCES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND

02:27:54.498 --> 02:27:56.267
SO WE WILL CONSIDER WHAT NEEDS

02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:57.902
TO HAPPEN AFTER THAT REPORTS NOT.

02:27:57.969 --> 02:27:59.136
ONLY RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:01.339
COSTS BY ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.840
I'M ARE RELATED TO THE AUDIT.

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:03.975
AND THEN --

02:28:04.041 --> 02:28:06.310
JUST FOR CLARITY EDUCATIONAL

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:08.145
ROUTINELY CONSIDERS REST FROM

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:09.780
ALL DIFFERENT AREAS AND NOT IT

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.816
DIVISION AT HOW WE SHOULD

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:13.618
PROCEED WITH ON GOING FUTURE.

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:14.719
AUDITS IN AREAS THAT HAVE RISK

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:18.556
THAT EGGS IT'S JUST SOMETHING

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.324
THAT WE RETAIN THE ROUTINELY DO

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:21.592
WE DID IT BEFORE CFA THOUGHT AND

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:24.228
WILL CONTINUE TO DO AFTER --

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:25.863
THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION RELATES

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.531
TO THE MONITORING EFFORTS BY THE

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:28.833
EARLY EDUCATION SUPPORT DIVISION

02:28:28.899 --> 02:28:31.235
AND I AM.

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:33.638
WE AGREE THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:34.705
WEEKEND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

02:28:34.772 --> 02:28:36.140
DOCUMENTATION HOWEVER IT SHOULD

02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:37.642
BE NOTED THAT IT'S NOT EVERY

02:28:37.708 --> 02:28:39.410
AREA THAT NO DOCUMENTATION WAS

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:41.045
ON PRESENTED AREAS WHERE THERE

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.380
IS NOT COMPLIANCE.

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:43.147
THERE IS DOCUMENTATION TO

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.515
SUPPORT THAT I'M AREAS OF

02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:45.516
ELIGIBILITY THERE IS

02:28:45.583 --> 02:28:47.051
DOCUMENTATION TO THE PART THAT'S

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.519
SO --

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:50.054
HOWEVER AND THE OTHER AREAS.

02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:51.155
WHAT WILL BE ADDED IS A

02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:51.722
DESCRIPTION OF THE DOCUMENTS

02:28:51.789 --> 02:28:53.958
REVIEWED --

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:55.393
OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE MADE AND

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:56.360
INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:58.362
INTERVIEWS ONE THING THAT I DO

02:28:58.429 --> 02:29:01.465
WANNA NOTE THOUGH IS THAT --

02:29:01.532 --> 02:29:02.033
I MONITORING REVIEW AND THE

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:04.068
AUDIT ARE REALLY TWO DIFFERENT

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:05.903
THINGS MONITORING REVIEWS ARE

02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:07.238
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAPPEN WITH

02:29:07.305 --> 02:29:08.406
PROGRAMS THAT THEY PROVIDE

02:29:08.472 --> 02:29:10.274
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY LOOK

02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:12.009
AT CERTAIN AREAS--

02:29:12.076 --> 02:29:13.678
AND THEY WORK WITH AGENCIES --

02:29:13.744 --> 02:29:15.212
THERE'S A LOT AGENCIES TO COVER

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.881
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IS NOT

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:18.449
EXPECTED TO BE THE SAME --

02:29:18.516 --> 02:29:21.852
IN DEPTH LEVEL OF REVIEW OF

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:23.454
DOCUMENTATION.

02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:24.555
OR NECESSARILY --

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:25.823
THAT THEY END UP LEVEL

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.091
DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED OF AN

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:27.858
ARTIST I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:29:27.925 --> 02:29:28.793
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:30.394
THOSE REALLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:31.696
FUNCTIONS --

02:29:31.762 --> 02:29:33.364
THE MONITORING REVIEWS TECHNO

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:35.066
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:36.367
TRAINING --

02:29:36.434 --> 02:29:38.336
PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:39.937
IDENTIFY READ FIVE SIX CETERA.

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:42.573
AND IN THAT COULD RESULT IN AN

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.108
AUDIT WHICH IN THIS CASE DEAD --

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:45.343
WE ARE REQUESTED TO THE DO THE

02:29:45.409 --> 02:29:46.877
AUDIT AND WE HAD STARTED THAT.

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:50.514
IN MARCH I TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO --

02:29:50.581 --> 02:29:51.048
FIXED Y. TO POINT THAT OUT

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:51.349
[inaudible]

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:55.319
AND BUT AGAIN I WE AGREE THAT WE

02:29:55.386 --> 02:29:56.454
CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT

02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:59.490
WAY DOWN BE OF ASSISTANCE --

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:00.891
TO FOLLOW BEHIND THE CONCLUSIONS

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.360
THAT ARE REACHED IN THE AREAS

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:06.697
FOR COMPLIANCE IS REACHED.

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:08.532
AND THE LAST AREA THAT WE AGREE

02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:09.967
WITH AS WELL IS THAT I RELATED

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:10.534
TO THAT.

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:12.803
PENSION FUNDS.

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:14.138
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A CLASS

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:15.873
ACTION LAWSUIT ITS ONGOING

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:18.042
CURRENTLY SO AND TELL THAT CLASS

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:20.010
ACTION LAWSUIT IS COMPLETED.

02:30:20.077 --> 02:30:21.045
THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD DETERMINE

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:22.780
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO

02:30:22.847 --> 02:30:24.415
TAKE IT SHOULD BE NOTED TOO THAT --

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:25.249
IN THAT --

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:27.451
AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT THE LAST

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.653
TIME FUNDS WERE I'M PROVIDED FOR

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.489
THIS ON PENSION FUND WAS TWO

02:30:31.555 --> 02:30:33.124
THOUSAND NINE SO THAT'S A NUMBER

02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:34.358
OF YEARS AGO.

02:30:34.425 --> 02:30:35.593
BUT WE WILL TAKE ACTION AGAIN

02:30:35.659 --> 02:30:37.294
BASED ON THE THE LAWSUIT HOW

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:39.563
THAT TURNS OUT.

02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:41.332
THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE WANNA

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:42.533
ANSWER BACK.

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:45.636
TO OURRECOMMENDATION NUMBER.

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:46.971
FOUR WHICH DOES TALK ABOUT THE

02:30:47.037 --> 02:30:48.472
APPEAL PROCESS AND WE TALKED

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:49.373
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT --

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:52.510
BEFORE HOWEVER --

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.311
THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:55.246
EDUCATION WAS SURPRISED

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:56.781
CONCERNED.

02:30:56.847 --> 02:30:57.915
ABOUT LACTATE BACKDATING OF THE

02:30:57.982 --> 02:31:01.852
NOTICES --

02:31:01.919 --> 02:31:03.020
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:04.221
HAPPEN IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

02:31:04.288 --> 02:31:06.123
FAMILIES TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.792
TIMELY AND LEAD WE EXPECT THAT

02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:10.127
AND COMMUNICATION.

02:31:10.194 --> 02:31:10.961
THE REASON WHY WE HAVE A LITTLE

02:31:11.028 --> 02:31:12.263
BIT OF A DIFFERENT --

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:15.332
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THERE ARE.

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:17.735
REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCIES TO

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:20.771
PROVIDE INFORMATION TO FAMILIES.

02:31:20.838 --> 02:31:23.908
IN THIS CASE IT WAS CONCEALED.

02:31:23.974 --> 02:31:26.010
BY THE BACKDATING OUT.

02:31:26.076 --> 02:31:26.577
BUT THERE ARE PROCEDURES IN

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:30.347
PLACE AND ALSO WE DO HAVE THE

02:31:30.414 --> 02:31:31.949
FORM THE ONE THING THAT THAT I

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:33.350
THINK IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE AS

02:31:33.417 --> 02:31:35.252
WELL IS THAT.

02:31:35.319 --> 02:31:37.054
THE VALID GROUNDS FOR APPEALING

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:38.422
A NOTICE OF ACTION WHATEVER THAT

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:39.590
ACTION IS SIMPLY THAT THE FAMILY

02:31:39.657 --> 02:31:41.325
DISAGREE.

02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:42.626
THAT'S ALL I THEY DISAGREE AND

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:45.296
THEY CAN APPEAL TO THE AGENCY.

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.298
IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT --

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:49.166
DECISION THEY CAN APPEAL TO THAT

02:31:49.233 --> 02:31:50.434
APARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE

02:31:58.843 --> 02:32:00.578
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S

THEY'RE ALREADY.

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:12.623
IT WAS NOT CONSISTENTLY APPLIED.

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:15.493
WHICH IS IT IS NOT DUE TO THE

02:32:15.559 --> 02:32:16.494
LACK OF DIRECTION BY EDUCATION

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.027
BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT THAT

02:32:17.094 --> 02:32:17.895
INFORMATION TO BE.

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:20.531
INCLUDED IN THOSE NOTICES.

02:32:20.598 --> 02:32:22.766

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.072
WELL THAT THE MONITORING VISIT

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:30.241
DOES LOOK AT THE NOTICES.

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:33.844
THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DO.

02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:35.079
YOU KNOW ADVANCED INFORMATION

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:37.581
TECHNOLOGY AUDIT PROCEDURES THAT

IS SOMETHING AND AND WE

02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:40.551
APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISSUE WAS

02:32:40.618 --> 02:32:41.752
WITHOUT SO IT CAN BE --

02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:43.420
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED BUT

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:44.288
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

02:32:44.355 --> 02:32:45.789
WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT AND

02:32:45.856 --> 02:32:47.391
MONITORING OF REVIEW.

02:32:47.458 --> 02:32:48.158
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:50.194
WOULD BE MORE RELATED TO RISKS

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:51.962
IDENTIFIED AND A RESPONSE AND

02:32:52.029 --> 02:32:55.099
ABOUT IT.

02:32:55.165 --> 02:32:57.001
OKAY AND THEN THOUGH WANTS

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:57.301
[inaudible]

02:32:57.368 --> 02:33:01.605
ITEM.

02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.140
RELATES THAT CRITICAL APPRAISAL

02:33:03.207 --> 02:33:06.176
OF EACH EDUCATION PROGRAM.

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:07.444
AND THAT WE DID WANT TO NOTE

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:08.579
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

02:33:08.646 --> 02:33:10.047
IT DID RECEIVE SOME CLARIFYING

02:33:10.114 --> 02:33:12.149
INFORMATION YESTERDAY RELATED TO

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.717
THIS OUR RECOMMENDATION.

02:33:13.784 --> 02:33:17.054
AND NOTING THAT THE STATE ORDER

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:19.390
DOES NOT I INTERPRET THAT

02:33:19.456 --> 02:33:20.457
THEY'RE TO BE TWO SEPARATE

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:21.926
APPRAISALS THAT WE DO APPRECIATE

02:33:21.992 --> 02:33:22.860
THAT INFORMATION.

02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:24.595
HOWEVER WE STILL WANTED TO KNOW

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:25.029
THAT -- THAT

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.163
PUTS THE PROGRAM'S SELF

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:27.865
EVALUATION PROCESS.

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:29.066
WAS ADOPTED THROUGH THE

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:31.235
REGULATORY PROCESS AND EDUCATION

02:33:31.302 --> 02:33:32.836
IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY IN

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:35.606
THE REGULATORY AGENCY CHARGED.

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:36.373
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.442
OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM'S.

02:33:38.509 --> 02:33:39.677
THEREFORE --

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:40.578
WE FILL THE CALIFORNIA

02:33:40.644 --> 02:33:41.378
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S

02:33:41.445 --> 02:33:43.280
INTERPRET INTERPRETATION OF WHAT

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:45.583
IS REQUIRED.

02:33:45.649 --> 02:33:46.417
AND SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE HERE

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:48.719
ON ONE THING TO CONSIDER AS A

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:51.555
STATEWIDE PROCESS THERE'S ALL

02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:52.756
KINDS OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:54.692
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT --

02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:56.327
DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONAL

02:33:56.393 --> 02:33:59.296
STRUCTURES AND SIZES AND SO --

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:00.464
THAT THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE

02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:02.266
SOMETHING THAT THAT ALL AGENCIES

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:03.834
KIDNEY.

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:05.836
AND SO WELL YES THAT WERE TO BE

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:07.071
INVOLVED IF WE FEEL THAT THEY

02:34:07.137 --> 02:34:07.972
COULD RELY ON THE STAFF'S

02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:09.106
ASSESSMENT.

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:10.441
IN THAT PROCESS AND THERE MAY BE

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:11.809
OTHER WAYS AS WELL THAT THE

02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:12.843
DOCUMENTATION THAT COULD TAKE

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:14.678
PLACE.

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:16.180
SO THOSE WERE THAT PROTECT

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:17.948
PERSPECTIVES THAT WE WANTED TO

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:20.184

02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:25.856
JUST ASK A QUICK.

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:26.357
ONE WITH RESPECT TO THIS

02:34:26.423 --> 02:34:29.593
BACKDATING YOU KNOW WE'VE.

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:31.996
SORT OF DANCED AROUND THE

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:33.364
IDENTITY ISSUES THESE ARE

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:35.199
PERSONNEL ISSUES WE HAVEN'T

02:34:35.265 --> 02:34:37.201
DISCUSSED INDIVIDUALS WHOM.

02:34:37.267 --> 02:34:38.869
DID OR DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THIS

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:40.638
WHAT I WOULD CALL MISCONDUCT BUT

02:34:40.704 --> 02:34:41.005
IS IT.

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.673
IS IT POSSIBLE IN OUR STATE THAT

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:44.308
THE FOLKS AT ENGAGED IN THIS

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:45.709
BACKDATING.

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.444
A POP UP AT ANOTHER ORGANIZATION

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:52.249
AND DO THE VERY SAME THING.

02:34:52.316 --> 02:34:54.318
FELLOW AT THE MASSES EDUCATION

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:56.654
THIS IS STATE MONEY --

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.355
MISSES SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER

02:34:58.422 --> 02:34:59.356
THE PURVIEW THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:34:59.423 --> 02:35:00.758
EDUCATION I GUESS JUST TO

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:02.326
RESTATE IT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:04.695
THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS.

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:07.498
WHO ENGAGED IN THESE BACKDATING?

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:08.666
ACTIVITIES COULD POP UP AT

02:35:08.732 --> 02:35:11.268
ANOTHER ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:12.403
THAT.

02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:13.604
RECEIVE STATE MONEY AND DO THE

02:35:13.671 --> 02:35:15.572
VERY SAME THING.

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:17.007
SO FIRST WE TAKE THIS MATTER

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:18.976
VERY SERIOUSLY I AM NOT.

02:35:19.043 --> 02:35:20.210
SUGGESTING THAT YOU DIDN'T IN

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.679
I'M MY QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE

02:35:21.745 --> 02:35:23.447
INTERPRETED AS A CRITICISM OF

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:24.081
THE DEPARTMENT I APPRECIATE WHAT

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:25.582
YOU DO.

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.484
SO AND THAT WE DO NOT TRACK

02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:29.953
EMPLOYEES OF ALL THEIR FIVE

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:31.889
THIRTEEN HUNDRED CONTRACTS TO

02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:33.757
DETERMINE WHERE THEY COULD LAND

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:35.159
WE INSTEAD WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW

02:35:35.225 --> 02:35:37.494
THAT HAPPENED.

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:40.798
AND AND AS KIM STATED READ DO

02:35:40.864 --> 02:35:42.299
NOT DO FORENSIC AUDITS THAT DIVE

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:44.401
INTO THE IT SYSTEMS THEMSELVES

02:35:44.468 --> 02:35:45.569
BUT IN CHECKING WITH A

02:35:45.636 --> 02:35:46.270
CONTRACTOR.

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:47.905
AND THEN THAT THE SYSTEM THAT

02:35:47.971 --> 02:35:49.940
THEY USED THERE SEEM TO BE A FLY

02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:51.375
ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF FOR IT

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:52.943
SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:54.278
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:56.547
WASN'T PROGRAMMED CORRECTLY AND

02:35:56.613 --> 02:35:57.781
HENCE WAS ALLOWING FOR IT

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:58.082
[inaudible]

02:35:58.148 --> 02:35:58.615
SO [inaudible]

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.184
WHAT?

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:01.385
WHILE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:02.820
EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES WE ACTUALLY

02:36:02.886 --> 02:36:04.722
THINK THERE IS A SYSTEMS ISSUE

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:06.356
AND THAT IT SYSTEM SHOULD BE

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:06.990
ABLE TO PREVENT ALL OF THAT IN

02:36:07.057 --> 02:36:11.395
THE FUTURE.

02:36:11.462 --> 02:36:13.564
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE HITS

02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:15.699
AND IT'S REALLY A SHAME THAT WE

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:16.934
HAVE TO DESIGN SYSTEMS TO

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.569
PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:19.603
ENGAGING IN INTENTIONAL

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:21.338
MISCONDUCT.

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:23.073
I DID NOT ASK THE PRIOR PANEL

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:24.274
WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL OR

02:36:24.341 --> 02:36:26.243
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED --

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:27.244
RECEIVED APPROPRIATE

02:36:27.311 --> 02:36:28.812
DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHETHER THAT

02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:29.980
DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS IN

02:36:30.047 --> 02:36:30.748
WRITING AND PLACED IN A

02:36:30.814 --> 02:36:33.383
PERSONNEL FILE SO THAT SOMEONE.

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:34.852
WHO DOES A BACKGROUND CHECK

02:36:34.918 --> 02:36:36.320
COULD POSSIBLY AND COVER AN

02:36:36.386 --> 02:36:38.222
INDIVIDUAL WHO ENGAGES IN --

02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:40.023
INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:43.160
INVOLVES A INTEGRITY.

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:44.728
BUT I THINK THAT'S A SERIOUS

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:46.663
ISSUE.

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.332
WHERE I CAN RESULT HERE?

02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:49.533

OF THE BOARD MEMBERS THERE IS

02:53:52.288 --> 02:53:53.756
ONE BOARD MEMBER IN PARTICULAR

02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:55.124
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN ANOTHER

02:53:55.191 --> 02:53:57.360
SCANDAL IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

02:53:57.426 --> 02:53:59.061

JAIL TIME HE WAS REQUIRED TO PAY

02:54:01.364 --> 02:54:03.099
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO THE FACT

THAT HE SITTING ON FORESEES

02:54:05.468 --> 02:54:06.969
BOARD IS VERY CONCERNING?

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:09.272
THE FACT THAT FRED VILLASENOR

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:11.174
HAND PICKED TO THE MAJORITY OF

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:12.341
THE BOARD.

02:54:12.408 --> 02:54:14.911
AND OUR INTERIM DIRECTOR WAS IS

02:54:14.977 --> 02:54:16.045
A GOOD FRIEND OF THIS BOARD

02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:18.681
MEMBER SO THEY'RE VERY CLOSELY

02:54:18.748 --> 02:54:20.349
IN TIED AS THEY SAY THAT THERE'S

02:54:20.416 --> 02:54:22.451
BEEN CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT THERE

02:54:22.518 --> 02:54:22.919
HASN'T BEEN CHANGED IN

02:54:22.985 --> 02:54:24.120
MANAGEMENT.

02:54:24.187 --> 02:54:26.122
THERE'S BEEN CHANGE OF TITLES SO

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:27.623
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:30.259
SCRUPULOUS ACTIVITIES ARE STILL

02:54:30.326 --> 02:54:32.728
WITHIN THE AGENCY BUT NOW WITH

02:54:32.795 --> 02:54:34.063
THE HIGHER TITLE.

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:35.698
SO IT IS CONCERNING I AM

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:37.967
DISAPPOINTED THAT --

02:54:38.034 --> 02:54:40.036
THEY'RE STILL FUNCTIONING --

02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:41.804
I WAS HOPING THAT THE CONTRACT

02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:43.372
WOULD HAVE BEEN DISABLED AND IT

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:44.707
WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSOURCED TO

02:54:44.774 --> 02:54:47.643
OTHER AGENCIES --

02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:49.545
I I'M I'M PRETTY OUTRAGED WITH

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:50.880
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AND

02:54:50.947 --> 02:54:53.349
PRETTY OUTRAGED WITH.

02:54:53.416 --> 02:54:55.451
THE STAFF THAT ARE STILL AT THE

02:54:55.518 --> 02:54:57.153
HELM OF THE SHIP EVEN THOUGH THE

PREDECESSORS HAVE TOOK IT OVER

02:55:00.723 --> 02:55:02.325
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CHANGE

02:55:02.391 --> 02:55:03.860
IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN --

02:55:03.926 --> 02:55:05.328
I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE HAS

02:55:05.394 --> 02:55:06.529
BEEN.

02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:08.731
PROCEDURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT

02:55:08.798 --> 02:55:10.700
NOW THAT FORESEES IS TRYING TO

02:55:10.766 --> 02:55:12.535

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:19.442
THAT THEY ASKED ME.

02:55:19.508 --> 02:55:21.644
TO SIGN SOMETHING THERE'S A FEAR

02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:23.980

MY CHILD CARE THERE IS

02:55:24.881 --> 02:55:27.083
DEFINITELY A TRUST ISSUE THAT

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:29.252
HAS NOT BEEN FIXED --

02:55:29.318 --> 02:55:30.853
IT IS EIGHT IT LEAVES ME EVERY

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:33.356

SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS ACCURATE

02:55:38.027 --> 02:55:38.794
AS POSSIBLE.

02:55:38.861 --> 02:55:41.264
BECAUSE I AM IN CONSTANT FEAR OF

02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:42.999
LOSING MY CHILD CARE.

02:57:00.643 --> 02:57:01.444
TO BE TRAINED THROUGH THE HIPAA

02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:02.778

AND ALSO --

03:00:44.433 --> 03:00:45.834
I ALSO WANT TO RAISE THE CONCERN

03:00:45.901 --> 03:00:47.736
THAT WE HEARD.

03:00:47.803 --> 03:00:50.039
THERE PEOPLE SEE A AT THE

03:00:54.043 --> 03:00:56.679
DEFICIENCIES THEM SOUTH PROBABLY

03:00:56.745 --> 03:00:57.680
PROBLEMS DO NOT JUST HAPPEN

03:00:57.746 --> 03:00:59.248

IT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER AM.

03:01:03.285 --> 03:01:04.420
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE

03:01:04.486 --> 03:01:05.854
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S HOW

03:01:05.921 --> 03:01:07.523
THE OVERSIGHT EVERY OVERSEE

03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:09.592
EVERYTHING AND IT DISAPPOINTMENT.

03:01:09.658 --> 03:01:11.694
DISAPPOINTS ME THAT THEY DON'T

03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:12.628
SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHAT

03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:13.596
THEY'RE DOING AND NOT FINING

03:01:13.662 --> 03:01:14.797
FINDINGS AND SO MANY WRONGFUL

03:01:14.863 --> 03:01:17.466
THINGS.

03:01:17.533 --> 03:01:18.701

03:01:19.902 --> 03:01:21.937
BOARD AT FOUR SEE IN ALL OF THE

CEO THAT PEOPLE USE TO HAVE.

03:01:23.706 --> 03:01:25.374

TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG.

03:01:30.479 --> 03:01:32.514
I AM ENCLOSING AS MY STATEMENT

03:01:32.581 --> 03:01:33.916
THE NEW CEO WANTS TO COVER THAT

03:01:33.983 --> 03:01:35.618
HE'S NEW BUT NOBODY GOES INTO A

03:01:35.684 --> 03:01:36.452
POSITION WITHOUT READING AND

03:01:37.786 --> 03:01:38.754
BACK HISTORY.

03:01:38.821 --> 03:01:40.489
SO FOR HIM TO BE HAVING SUCH A

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:42.358

03:01:42.424 --> 03:01:45.127

ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AND

03:13:31.566 --> 03:13:32.834
I ALSO BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:34.369
MORE AREAS WHERE FORESEES HAS

03:13:34.436 --> 03:13:35.704

03:13:40.141 --> 03:13:41.309
YOU SEE RIGHT NOW AT THE FORCE

03:13:41.376 --> 03:13:42.310
HE COUNSELED WITH REGARDS AND

03:13:42.377 --> 03:13:43.745
MANAGEMENT IS NOT DO MANAGEMENT

03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:45.447
THE ONLY NEW MANAGER.

03:13:45.513 --> 03:13:46.047
IS -- JOE

MATT AROUND THE INTERIM

03:13:47.482 --> 03:13:50.719

COULDN'T WHOSE.

03:13:52.187 --> 03:13:53.421
SO WHAT IS NOW THE COMPLIANCE

03:13:53.488 --> 03:13:55.156
OFFICER WAS.

03:13:55.223 --> 03:13:56.291
THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR

03:13:56.358 --> 03:13:58.093
MANY YEARS.

03:13:58.159 --> 03:13:59.828
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

HAS BEEN THERE FOR DECADES.

03:14:02.430 --> 03:14:03.498
AND ALL THEY DID WAS SHIFT

03:14:03.565 --> 03:14:05.500
PEOPLE AROUND IN ORDER TO MAKE

03:14:05.567 --> 03:14:06.301
IT SEEM LIKE THESE NEW

03:14:06.368 --> 03:14:08.203
MANAGEMENT THERE REALLY ISN'T.

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:09.337

03:14:09.404 --> 03:14:10.905
BRIEF NOT ONLY THAT THE AUDIT

03:14:10.972 --> 03:14:11.673
POINT TO FORCE THESE

03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.174
DEFICIENCIES IT ALSO ADDRESSES

03:14:13.241 --> 03:14:14.409
THOSE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF

AND WHAT I FOUND THAT THE IS

03:14:33.361 --> 03:14:36.398
THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN.

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:38.566
A LOT OF THOSE --

03:14:38.633 --> 03:14:40.135

03:17:53.261 --> 03:17:55.630
OF THEM IS THAT YOU KNOW SPECIAL

03:17:55.697 --> 03:17:57.565
ON A DAY LIKE TODAY OR SUPREME

03:18:10.445 --> 03:18:11.913
FORWARD --

03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:13.715
IT'S A COMMON REFRAIN THAT.

HAS BEEN HEARD FOR YEARS NOW.

03:18:15.583 --> 03:18:17.518
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ONLY

03:18:17.585 --> 03:18:18.253
UNACCEPTABLE.

03:18:18.319 --> 03:18:20.121

03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:24.959
ALBUM BUT IT'S ILLEGAL.

03:18:25.026 --> 03:18:28.363
AND AND IF THAT PATTERN.

03:18:37.572 --> 03:18:38.973
BETTER TO GET BETTER --

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:40.708
THAT THAT'S PART OF OF OF BEING

03:18:40.775 --> 03:18:43.077
RESPONSIBLE IN A POSITION OF

03:18:43.144 --> 03:18:43.711
LEADERSHIP IS TO ALLOW FOR THAT

03:18:43.778 --> 03:18:44.612
TO HAPPEN.

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:46.180

03:18:46.247 --> 03:18:47.749
BEEN DONE.
