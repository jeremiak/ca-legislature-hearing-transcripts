EVERYTHING RIGHT IN A DISTURBING

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.589
PROCESS BUT STILL EXEMPLIFIED

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.624
WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY?

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:01.925
SO IN A CITY SHIP FROM OUT LARGE

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:03.660

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:09.633
SHIFT TO DISTRICTS.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.635
WE FOUND OUT ABOUT AFTER TWO

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:12.636
HEARINGS HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:13.804
DRAFT MAPS THAT ARE THEN

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:14.605
PUBLISHED.

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.707
THE DRAFT MAPS SPLIT THE CITY'S

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.575
AFGHAN COMMUNITY INTO TWO OR

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:19.910
THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.612
DEPENDING ON THE MAP.

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:22.779
YOU MAY KNOW THAT FREMONT IS

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:24.581
HOME TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:26.650
AFGHAN POPULATION OUTSIDE OF

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:27.618
AFGHANISTAN.

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:29.586
AND YET BECAUSE THE AFGHAN

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:30.854
COMMUNITY HAS NO VOICE IN THE

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:32.689
CITY'S POLITICS NO AFGHANS HAVE

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.591
BEEN CONSULTED IN THE PROCESS

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.560
AND THE DRAFT MAPS HAD ENDED UP --

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.730
GERRYMANDERING THEM INTO

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.631
MULTIPLE DISTRICTS.

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:41.665
WE IMMEDIATELY DROPPED OUR OTHER

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:42.566

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:43.100
ASKING COMMUNITY WE BEGIN

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:43.834
EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ABOUT

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:46.603
DISTRICTS ABOUT.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.271
HOW THEY CAN GET INVOLVED IN THE

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.805
PROCESS AND REPAIR THEM TO STEP

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:49.606
FORWARD AND GIVE TESTIMONY?

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:50.974
IN THE FIRST TWO DISTRICTING

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.576
HEARINGS THERE IS ZERO AFGHANS

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.578
PRESENT IN THE LAST TWO AFGHANS

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:55.812
OVER HALF OF THE SPEAKERS NONE

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.648
OF THEM HAVE EVER SPOKEN TO

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:58.615
THEIR CITY COUNCIL BEFORE.

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.583
THEY SPOKE PASSIONATELY

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.618
SOMETIMES THE TRANSLATOR BUT HOW

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.653
IMPORTANT FREMONT WANTS THE

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:03.720
AFGHAN COMMUNITY AND HOW

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:05.923
IMPORTANT THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:06.623
WAS TO FREMONT.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.858
THEY SPOKE ABOUT FINDING A NEW

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:08.825
HOME AFTER WITHIN ONE TORN BY

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:10.694
WAR AND THEY FELT THEY SPOKE

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:11.795
ABOUT A FEELING LISTEN TO IN

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:12.729
THEIR NEW HOME.

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:14.064
THE LONG STORY SHORT IS THE MAPS

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.799
WERE REDRAWN AND THE AFGHAN

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:16.867
CULTURAL AND COMMERCIAL HUB WAS

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.602
KEPT TOGETHER INTO ONE DISTRICT

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:19.670
IT WAS A VICTORY FOR

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:20.871
REPRESENTATION IN A FAIR

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:21.638
DEMOCRACY.

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:22.639
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.675
NO ONE OTHER THAN US REACHED OUT

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.609
TO THE AFGHAN COMMUNITIES AND

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.677
TOLD THEM THAT THIS PROCESS WAS

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:27.644
EVEN HAPPENING.

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.646
IF WE HAD A DECIDED TO DO THAT

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:30.180
THAT VICTORY WOULDN'T OF

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:30.614
HAPPENED.

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:31.782
THESE ARE WORKING FOLKS THEY

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:33.617
CAN'T TAKE KMART TIME OFTEN THE

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.751
DAY IF THOSE MEETINGS HAD IT

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:35.619
BEEN A NIGHT.

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.887
THIS VICTORY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.855
THERE WERE NO TRANSLATORS ON

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.557
HAND -- OTHER THAN COMMUNITY

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:41.658
MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO HELP

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:42.826
THEIR FELLOW -- NEIGHBORS IF

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:44.661
THAT WASN'T TRUE THIS VICTORY

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:45.796
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT TOOK

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:46.730
US TIME TO ORGANIZE AND TO

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:47.898
EDUCATE AND TO MOBILIZE IF

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.700
THERE'D BEEN JUST ONE HEARING AS

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:50.667

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:51.635
REDISTRICTING.

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.636
THAT VICTORY WOULDN'T OF

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:53.637
HAPPENED.

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:54.905
IN FREMONT LITERALLY EVERYTHING

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:56.673
WENT RIGHT NOW -- BUT IF ONE

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.874
THING HADN'T THAT COMMUNITY

00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:59.610

THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN LETTERS TO

MISTER MAYES AND WHAT I THINK OF

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.597
SOME BILLS WERE MADE TO YOUR

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:50.765
COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:54.835
CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITIES OF

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.604
THIS BILL.

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:57.772
YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER.

01:32:57.838 --> 01:32:58.706
ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.574
RAISED BY THIS PARTICULAR BILL

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:01.709
IT'S S. PIECE OF SPECIAL

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.544
LEGISLATION THAT PURPORTS TO

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:04.578
REGULATE INTO AN AREA THAT'S

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.614
FULLY REGULATED BY.

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:07.982
THE GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.984
ACT OF TWO THOUSAND IT RAISES

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.620
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF EQUAL

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.788
PROTECTION [inaudible]

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:17.591
BECAUSE IN MY VIEW IT IS A BILL

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.593
THAT PROVIDES A SOLUTION LOOKING

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.595
FOR A PROBLEM.

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:23.564
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.599
SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE AYE ID.

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.535
THE RATES ARE THE MOST

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.602
COMPETITIVE IN THE STATE.

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:29.737
IT CHARGED VIRTUALLY HALF OF

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.772
WHAT OUR IMMEDIATE COMPETITOR

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.808
DOESN'T IN APRIL EXCUSE ME IN

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.742
RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:39.780
THE BILL ALSO WOULD IRONICALLY

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:40.614
ENOUGH.

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:41.615
CREATE THE ABILITY OF RIVERSIDE

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:43.651
COUNTY VOTERS TO CONTROL AN

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:46.620
INITIATE ACTIONS ON ASSESSMENTS.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:48.589
AND ASSESSMENTS ARE PRIMARILY

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.591
AND ALMOST ALWAYS

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.692
CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. FOR

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:53.627
IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO OWN LAND

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.830
WITHIN THE DISTRICT THE DISTRICT

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:56.630
THE ID'S.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.599
LAND IS LOCATED IN IMPERIAL

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.601
COUNTY NOT RIVERSIDE COUNTY YET

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.570
THIS WOULD GIVE POWER TO

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.871
RESIDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.773
WITH LEAST INITIATE OR IMPOSE

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.774
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENTS.

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:09.577
SO IF THERE'S A TAXATION WITHOUT

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:10.544
REPRESENTATION ARGUMENT TO BE

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:10.745
MADE.

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.713
THE IRONY HERE IS THAT IT REALLY

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.749
POTENTIALLY IMPOSES TAXATION

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:18.586
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ON

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.720
RESIDENTS OF THE IMPERIAL VALLEY.

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.822
THE MOST TELLING ARGUMENT THOUGH

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:23.557
THAT THAT THIS BILL.

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:24.658
REALLY PRESENTS AS A PROBLEM IS

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.827
THE INVASION OF THE WATER RIGHTS

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.562
THAT ARE HELD BY THE IMPERIAL

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:29.630
IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:30.765
THE WATER RIGHTS OUR WATER

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.733
RIGHTS WERE DEVELOPED AT THE

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.667
TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY THE

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.603
NOTICES OF APPROPRIATION WHERE

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:36.771
THE COLORADO RIVER WAS BEING

01:34:36.837 --> 01:34:38.906
USED TO IRRIGATE FARMLAND IN THE

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:39.707
IMPERIAL VALLEY.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:40.775
AS WELL AS CITIES AND SOME

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.643
INDUSTRIAL USES.

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.545
THAT WATER RIGHT HAS BEEN

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:45.846
CONSECRATED IN A SERIES OF

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.681
DECISIONS AND LAWS AND

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.617
ENACTMENTS BY CONGRESS.

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:50.718
ALL OF WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN THE

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.953
REAL UNDER THE RUBRIC OF THE LAW

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.721
OF THE RIVER.

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.656
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:56.724
IMPLICATION DISTRICT HOLD A

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:57.658
WATER RIGHT IN TELLING THAT TO

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:58.993
THREE POINT ONE MILLION ACRE

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.629
FEET OF WATER PER YEAR.

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:03.597
IT IS THE SINGLE LARGEST

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.599
CONTRACTOR WHO CAN TAKE WATER

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.601
OUT OF THE COLORADO RIVER.

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:08.636
ON THE RIVER.

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.704
IT EXCEEDS ANYBODY ANY OTHER

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:12.673
SINGLE USER OF THE RIVER AND THE

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.608
SOLE SOURCE OF WATER FOR THE

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:15.843
IMPERIAL VALLEY IS THE COLORADO

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.611
RIVER.

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:20.714
IF YOU DELEGATE CONTROL OF THE

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.650
AYE ID BOARD TO RESIDENTS WHO

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.585
LIVE IN RIVER SIDE YOU HAVE

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.786
PEOPLE THEN AND RIVERSIDE.

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.588
WHO HAVE NO HISTORICALLY

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:28.823
INTEREST IN FARMING OR THE

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.624
ACTIVITIES OF IMPERIAL COUNTY?

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:33.594
CONTROLLING WHAT THE ID DOES

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:34.662
WITH RESPECT WAS WATER RIGHTS

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.598
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE HI ID

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.633
OR NOR ITS PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH.

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:44.572
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NO NO IN FACT

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:45.606
IT COULD EVEN BE A TAKING.

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:46.674
BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.576
LEGISLATION BY FIAT WOULD TAKE

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:49.643
THAT WATER RIGHT AWAY AND

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.579
CONFERRED ON A BODY OF PEOPLE

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:54.615
WHO MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED.

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:55.282
AND MAY HAVE THE RIGHTS OF THEIR

01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:55.616

RESIDENTS AND VOTERS IN THEIR

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:58.686
HEARTS BUT IT TAKES AWAY

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:00.588
SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY RIGHT THAT

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:01.889
HAS EXISTED FOR MORE THAN A

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.557
HUNDRED YEARS AND IMPERIAL

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:04.625

AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.628
IMPERIAL COUNTY.

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.697
THE THE OTHER ISSUES ARE.

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:10.898
THAT ARE RAISED HERE ARE VOTING

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:11.765
RIGHTS ISSUES WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:12.900
RAISED BY LETTER AND SUBMITTED

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:13.667
TO YOU.

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.935
IT VIOLATES POTENTIALLY THE ONE

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.837
PERSON ONE VOTE RULE BECAUSE

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.572
YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A TREMENDOUS

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.708
THE HUGE POPULATION BASE TO THE

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.710
REPRESENTATION OF THE ID BOARD.

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:25.579
AND EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.617
AND REMEMBER THIS.

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:33.621
THE BILL COUNTY IS 85290% LATINO.

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:34.755
IT IS ONE OF THE POOREST

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:35.890

THE PEOPLE OF IMPERIAL VALLEY

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:48.636
VIRTUALLY NOTHING IN COMMON.

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:49.570
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE

INDIA.

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.579
HISTORICALLY THERE HAS BEEN AN

01:36:58.646 --> 01:36:59.847
ADVERSE POSITION BETWEEN THE

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:01.615

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:54.581
UNDERSTANDING THAT USUALLY THESE

LOCAL PROCESS FIRST AND I

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.587
BELIEVE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE

01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:03.590
NOT HAPPENED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.726

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:10.831
I FEEL THIS BILL IS A LITTLE BIT

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.600

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.654
SOME THAT THINK THAT ID IS ONE

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.621

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.590

FACT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:57.578
THERE'D BE A MECHANISM IN PLACE

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:59.713

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.614
TO ADDRESS THIS.

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:03.650
IN FACT THEY HAVE -- THEY IN TWO

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.118
THOUSAND SEVEN AND I THINK WE'VE

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.620
HANDED OUT COPIES.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:09.656

READ THIS MADAM CHAIR.

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:22.803
SINCE THE MAJORITY OF IDEAS

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:23.303
SERVICE POPULATION FOR

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:24.037
ELECTRICITY IS WITHIN THE COUNTY

01:42:24.104 --> 01:42:24.838
RIVERSIDE STAFF RECOMMENDS THE

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:25.806
DISTRICTS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE BE

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:26.573
ESTABLISHED TO INCLUDED SERVICE

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.608
AREA.

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:28.842
AS DEPICTED IN THE ATTACHED

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:29.610
EXHIBIT.

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.578
IN ADDITION STAFF RECOMMENDS ID

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:32.679
FORMALLY SUBMITTED ANNEXATION

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.681
APPLICATION TO INCLUDE THE AREA

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:35.916
ESTABLISHED AS ITS FEAR OF

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.618
INFLUENCE ALLOWING FOR

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:38.585
COTERMINOUS FEAR.

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.587
THIS WOULD ALLOW THIS IMPORTANT

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:42.556
PART THIS WOULD ALLOW THE

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:43.824
REGISTERED VOTERS WITHIN THE

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:44.625
COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE TO

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.593
PARTICIPATE IN IDEAS ELECTIONS.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.562
CURRENTLY CUSTOMERS WITHIN

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:49.530
RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE NOT

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:50.731
REPRESENTED BY ID'S BOARD OF

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:52.599
DIRECTORS EACH BOARD MEMBERS

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.734
RESPONSIBLE FOR DIVISION NONE OF

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.569
WHICH INCLUDES REGISTERED VOTERS

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:56.603
WITHIN THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE.

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.672
SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I GOT

01:42:58.739 --> 01:42:59.773
MYSELF INTO FINANCES THIS BILL

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.576
IF I CAN BE -- CAN BE REAL --

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:03.777
BUT IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR TO ME

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:04.945
THAT THIS THE VOTING RIGHTS --

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:05.979
ISSUE THAT WE WANTED BILL TO

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:07.714
PROVIDE THIS I IDN'T REALIZE

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:09.650
THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THEY

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:11.618
DIDN'T JUST COME UP IN TWO

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.686
THOUSAND SEVEN IN FACT IT HAS

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:14.555
BEEN -- IT IT'S BEEN PROBABLY

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.690
THIRTY YEAR PROCESS -- AND THE

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:19.560
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WHEN IT

01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:20.594
WAS FORMED OVER.

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:22.663
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO --

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:24.631
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO A NO

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:25.799
ONE PROVIDED POWER AT THE TIME

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.768
AND SO IT MADE SENSE FOR A LOCAL

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.603
WATER AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.604
PROVIDE POWER.

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:31.738
BUT WHAT ENDS UP WHAT ENDED UP

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.807
HAPPENING OVER TIME IS YOU ENDED

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.909
UP WITH NINETY TWO THOUSAND

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:36.944
VOTERS THAT LIVE WITHIN THE

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.612
RIVERSIDE COUNTY PORTION.

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.646
THAT ARE DISENFRANCHISED THE

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:42.583
RIVERSIDE COUNTY LASKO SAYS WE

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:44.851
WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:45.686
BUT THEY HAVE NO POWER OVER

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:46.620
IMPERIAL COUNTY.

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:47.854
NOW YOU HEARD FROM IMPERIAL

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:48.989
COUNTY THAT THEY WERE OPPOSED

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.657
BUT OF COURSE THEY THEY WOULD BE

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:51.792
OPPOSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:55.762
POLITICAL POWER TODAY IN

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:56.630
IMPERIAL COUNTY.

01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:57.931
MY GOAL WITH THIS LEGISLATION AS

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:58.799
I'VE LEARNED IT IS NOT SIMPLE IN

01:43:58.865 --> 01:43:59.933
FACT I WOULD TELL YOU IF I WAS

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.635
SITTING BEFORE YOU TODAY.

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:03.570
I DON'T THINK THE LANGUAGE -- I

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:04.571
WOULD NOT IF I WAS THE GOVERNOR

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:05.772
AND THE LANGUAGE BEFORE ME I

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:07.608
WOULD NOT SIGN THIS INTO INTO

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.610
LAW IT NEEDS SOME WORK.

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:12.546
IT NEEDS WORK -- AND MY HOPE

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:14.548
WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:15.148
CONVERSATION WITH THE IMPALER

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:16.783

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.820
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I RECEIVED A

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:21.755
LETTER FROM THEM AFTER A MEETING

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:22.623

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.725
IN AT ONE OF THEIR OFFICE TO TRY

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.693
TO FIGURE THIS OUT I GOT A

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.661
LETTER FROM THEM I'VE NEVER SAYS

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:28.829
NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER LIKE

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.597
THIS EVER BEFORE FROM A PUBLIC

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:31.898
AGENCY THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:34.601
AGENCY NOT A NOT A AN INVESTOR

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.741
THEY SAID TO ME IT DOES NOT

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.576
RECOGNIZE VOTING RIGHTS CURRENT

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:43.844

IN ADDITION THEY SAID.

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.787

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:55.622
PRIVATE MEETINGS.

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.691

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:14.801
I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE ANY

AS OTHER PATH IN GOING FORWARD

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:59.012

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:28.608
STAGGERING.

01:57:28.674 --> 01:57:30.676
NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:33.546
AND NOT ONE SINGLE COUNTY SHOULD

01:57:33.613 --> 01:57:34.981
HAVE TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN --

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:37.617
THE THE BURDEN THAT COMES FROM.

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:40.586
THIS KIND OF UNANTICIPATED

01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:41.621
EXPENSES.

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:43.589

01:57:47.693 --> 01:57:49.629

HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.870
THE COSTS OF A LARGE CASE ARE

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.738
ALWAYS ANTICIPATED IN THE

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.674
ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND

TRIAL IN SACRAMENTO WILL BE

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:39.612
EXTRAORDINARY.

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:42.014
AND AB ONE FORTY ONE PROVIDES A

01:58:42.081 --> 01:58:43.583
MEASURE TO RELIEVE THAT BURDEN

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:45.585
ON THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THE

BECAUSE THERE AREN'T SUFFICIENT

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:02.835
ONE COUNTY SIMPLY CANNOT BEAR ON

THE BILL IS PROVIDED BY

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:43.821
TOMBSTONE TERRITORY WHICH IS A

02:27:43.888 --> 02:27:45.656
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:46.624
FRESNO COUNTY.

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:48.659

ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.637
TOMBSTONE IS LESS THAN A MILE.

02:27:59.704 --> 02:28:00.738
FROM THE CITY OF SINGER WHICH

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:01.872
PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER

THROUGH A PUBLIC SYSTEM.

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:04.642
HOWEVER THE WAY THAT THE

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:05.810
RELEVANT STATUTE AS CURRENTLY

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:06.811
WRITTEN THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:09.614
MUST OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM

BEFORE IT COMPLETES A

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.553
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS -- THIS

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:16.587
BILL WOULD MOVE THAT PROCESS

02:28:16.654 --> 02:28:18.556
CHANGE THAT PROCESS SO WRITTEN

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:19.757
CONSENT IS CONSIDERED WHEN THE

02:28:19.824 --> 02:28:21.759

THIS IS COMPLETED.

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:25.596
AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT CHANGES

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:26.697
THAT IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT WHEN

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.566
WE'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:30.668
TO GET CONSENT -- WHILE THE

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:31.602

02:28:31.669 --> 02:28:33.604
UNKNOWN PRIOR TO A FEASIBILITY

02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:34.639
ANALYSIS.

02:28:34.705 --> 02:28:35.640
SO.

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:36.841
THE BILL WOULD MOVE THAT PROCESS

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:38.743
SORT OF AND ANALYZING CONSENT

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:40.678

THE PROJECT IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:46.150
AND THEN THE SECOND THING THE

02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:46.917
BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD

02:28:46.984 --> 02:28:47.918
REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD TO

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:50.588
NOTIFY BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:50.855
CURRENT.

02:28:50.921 --> 02:28:53.858
OCCUPANTS OF DWELLINGS WITHIN A

02:28:53.924 --> 02:28:55.726

03:04:23.652 --> 03:04:25.587
BUILDING AROUND THE CONNECTS THE

03:04:25.654 --> 03:04:27.022

03:04:41.136 --> 03:04:42.638
ROADS.

03:04:42.704 --> 03:04:43.806
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THE

03:04:43.872 --> 03:04:44.940
EIGHTIES THERE WAS NO MONEY

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:45.674
AVAILABLE.

03:04:45.741 --> 03:04:47.776
THE STATE ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE

03:04:47.843 --> 03:04:49.678

STATE ROADS AND THAT'S WHY THE

03:04:56.919 --> 03:04:57.820

A YEAR AGO THEY TURNED OUT ONE

03:05:02.991 --> 03:05:04.726
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR TO ADD

03:05:04.793 --> 03:05:05.794

BUT THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:26.648
APPROVED SO THAT'S PART OF THE

03:05:26.715 --> 03:05:28.584
PLANNING THING BECAUSE THE LAST

03:30:10.698 --> 03:30:12.733
BECAUSE NO PUBLIC ENTITY IN THE

STAFF WE STE WITH FIND OURSELVES

04:09:45.937 --> 04:09:46.771
IN THE SAME COMMISSION THAT WAS

04:09:46.838 --> 04:09:47.939
THE POSITION OF THE STARTED AND

04:09:48.006 --> 04:09:49.808
WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENGAGING

04:09:49.874 --> 04:09:50.775
IN THESE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE A

04:09:50.842 --> 04:09:52.610
LACK OF AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE

04:09:52.677 --> 04:09:53.611
STATE HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS

04:09:53.678 --> 04:09:54.946
HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM IN

04:09:55.013 --> 04:09:56.648
CALIFORNIA.

04:09:56.715 --> 04:09:57.615
HOWEVER THE MINISTERIAL

04:09:57.682 --> 04:09:59.617
PERMITTING PROCESS AS DELINEATED

04:09:59.684 --> 04:10:01.619
IN THIS BILL CURRENTLY WOULD NOT

04:10:01.686 --> 04:10:03.621
BE AVAILABLE UNLESS THE FARMER

04:10:03.688 --> 04:10:05.590
TURNS OPERATION OTHER HOUSING

04:10:05.657 --> 04:10:06.691
OVER TO A THIRD PARTY.

04:10:06.758 --> 04:10:08.660
OUT FEW FARMERS WOULD BE WILLING

04:10:08.727 --> 04:10:09.994
TO DO THIS AS THEY WOULD REMAIN

04:10:10.061 --> 04:10:11.730
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

04:10:11.796 --> 04:10:13.665
HOUSING AND ANY LIABILITY CLAIMS

04:10:13.732 --> 04:10:17.635
ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OPERATION.

04:10:17.702 --> 04:10:19.070
WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

04:10:19.137 --> 04:10:19.704
INSTEAD COMMITTED TO FINDING AN

04:10:19.771 --> 04:10:20.605
ALTERNATIVE THAT DOES NOT

04:10:20.672 --> 04:10:22.574
DISCOURAGE OUR FARMERS FROM

04:10:22.640 --> 04:10:23.675
DEPLOYING THEIR CAPITAL AND

04:10:23.742 --> 04:10:24.976
THEIR LAND TO MEET THIS URGENT

04:10:25.043 --> 04:10:26.578
NEED.

04:10:26.644 --> 04:10:27.912
WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED AT

04:10:27.979 --> 04:10:29.681
THE SAME TIME ABOUT LANGUAGE IN

04:10:29.748 --> 04:10:30.749
THE BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT

04:10:30.815 --> 04:10:32.617
STATE FUNDING FOR THE PLANNING

04:10:32.684 --> 04:10:34.586
DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF

04:10:34.652 --> 04:10:35.653
HOUSING.

04:10:35.720 --> 04:10:36.788
THAT WOULD BE UTILIZED FOR H. TO

04:10:36.855 --> 04:10:37.655
A EMPLOYEES.

04:10:37.722 --> 04:10:39.724
THE REALITY IS THAT FARMERS HERE

04:10:39.791 --> 04:10:41.626
AND ELSEWHERE IN UNITED STATES

04:10:41.693 --> 04:10:42.594

AUTHOR AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE

04:10:50.769 --> 04:10:52.604
BUT AS FAR HOUSING IS CRITICALLY

04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:53.638
IMPORTANT.

04:10:53.705 --> 04:10:54.839
WE JUST BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

04:10:54.906 --> 04:10:55.740
BE LOOKING AT THIS FROM A

04:10:55.807 --> 04:10:56.775
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

04:10:56.841 --> 04:10:58.643

04:11:03.748 --> 04:11:04.716
CALIFORNIA FARM HERE WHERE

EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

04:11:09.721 --> 04:11:10.822
DEVELOPMENT OF FORMER HOUSING WE

04:11:10.889 --> 04:11:12.791
SHARE THAT GOAL -- UNFORTUNATELY

04:11:12.857 --> 04:11:13.925
JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD

04:11:13.992 --> 04:11:15.560
MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS

04:11:15.627 --> 04:11:17.562
THAT THE EXEMPTION IS PROVIDED

04:11:17.629 --> 04:11:18.863

04:11:18.930 --> 04:11:20.598

04:11:21.733 --> 04:11:23.601
WITH NO LIABILITY PROTECTIONS

04:11:23.668 --> 04:11:25.036
THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

04:11:25.103 --> 04:11:25.637
CITING.

04:11:25.703 --> 04:11:27.672
SO UNDER THE BILL YOU COULD NOT

04:11:27.739 --> 04:11:28.940
CITE ANY OF THIS HOUSING ON

04:11:29.007 --> 04:11:30.608

04:11:31.943 --> 04:11:32.944
MILLION FARM AND RANCH LANDS IN

04:11:33.011 --> 04:11:35.613
CALIFORNIA -- YOU ALSO CAN'T

04:11:35.680 --> 04:11:36.781

04:11:36.848 --> 04:11:38.683
ACOSTA PROGRAMS ARE PREDICATED

04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:40.652
ON STATE AND LOCAL APPROVAL OF

04:11:40.718 --> 04:11:42.620
HAVING FARM WORKER HOUSING AS A

04:11:42.687 --> 04:11:43.721
MANDATORY PORTION OR VERY

04:11:43.788 --> 04:11:45.690
IMPORTANT PORTION OF OUR COASTAL

04:11:45.757 --> 04:11:47.559
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY

04:11:47.625 --> 04:11:47.792
WHERE.

04:11:47.859 --> 04:11:48.893
HOUSING COSTS ARE TREMENDOUS

04:11:48.960 --> 04:11:50.795
JUST AS THE COMMENTARY WAS A

04:11:50.862 --> 04:11:52.630
NAPA.

04:11:52.697 --> 04:11:53.264
I'M BEYOND THAT I THINK WE HAVE

04:11:53.331 --> 04:11:53.631
SOME.

04:11:53.698 --> 04:11:54.999
BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL

04:11:55.066 --> 04:11:56.768
TRYING TEN HOUSING RIGHTS TO

04:11:56.835 --> 04:11:58.670
EMPLOYEE HOUSING RATES -- NOW

04:11:58.736 --> 04:12:00.638
THIS WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH

04:12:00.705 --> 04:12:01.606
HOW WE ACT FOR ANY OTHER

04:12:01.673 --> 04:12:02.974
EMPLOYEE WHERE PROVIDED WE'RE

04:12:03.041 --> 04:12:05.009
HOUSING AS A CONDITION OF THEIR

04:12:05.076 --> 04:12:05.610
EMPLOYMENT.

04:12:05.677 --> 04:12:06.644
I'M IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR THESE

04:12:06.711 --> 04:12:07.779
AGRICULTURAL PLAYS REGARDLESS I

04:12:07.846 --> 04:12:09.547
THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT

04:12:09.614 --> 04:12:10.615
OUR EMPLOYEES TO FEEL.

04:12:10.682 --> 04:12:12.550
COMFORTABLE AND THE HOUSING

04:12:12.617 --> 04:12:13.718
OPERATION THAT THEY FEEL IS

04:12:13.785 --> 04:12:18.623
AFFORDABLE AND IS SAFE -- BUT

04:12:18.690 --> 04:12:19.624
UNFORTUNATELY.

04:12:19.691 --> 04:12:21.059
WELL IN THE END I THINK IT

04:12:21.125 --> 04:12:21.759
PRACTICALLY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

04:12:21.826 --> 04:12:22.360
EXISTING EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

04:12:22.427 --> 04:12:22.827
COVER DISCRIMINATIONS

04:12:22.894 --> 04:12:23.928
PROTECTIONS AND SOME OF THOSE

04:12:23.995 --> 04:12:25.597
TEN OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE THERE

04:12:25.663 --> 04:12:26.664
FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES ARE

04:12:26.731 --> 04:12:28.633
READY SO WE DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH

04:12:28.700 --> 04:12:29.934
THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY

04:12:30.001 --> 04:12:30.635
AND THEN I THINK.

04:12:30.702 --> 04:12:32.804
PRACTICALLY TIME TEN HOUSING

04:12:32.871 --> 04:12:33.738
RIGHT SIMPLY HOUSING RATES JUST

04:12:33.805 --> 04:12:35.607
TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE UNDER

04:12:35.673 --> 04:12:36.674
CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING TEN

04:12:36.741 --> 04:12:37.642
HOUSING RATES LAW.

04:12:37.709 --> 04:12:39.711
YOU HAVE A THIRTY DAYS NOTICE TO

THAT EMPLOYEE WITH AND HAVE THE

04:12:46.851 --> 04:12:47.819
RIGHT TO RESIDE WITHIN THAT

AND AT THAT COULD BE INCREDIBLY

04:12:57.795 --> 04:12:58.630
DESTRUCTIVE.

04:12:58.696 --> 04:12:59.731
I TO THE OPERATION AND IN

04:12:59.797 --> 04:13:00.932

TO DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

04:29:19.743 --> 04:29:20.644
OVERSIGHT.

04:29:20.711 --> 04:29:21.712
THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROVE SOMETHIN

04:29:21.778 --> 04:29:22.713
IS A FISCALLY SOLVENT LET'S

04:29:22.779 --> 04:29:24.648
LET'S PUT THAT ON THE TABLE.

04:29:24.715 --> 04:29:26.850
I AND THEY'LL HAVE TO WILL HAVE

04:29:26.917 --> 04:29:28.785
TO ABIDE BY FEDERAL LAWS IN ANY

04:29:28.852 --> 04:29:29.620
OF THE REGULATIONS.

04:29:29.686 --> 04:29:31.021
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING

04:29:31.088 --> 04:29:33.557
DIFFERENT -- THAN ANY OTHER

04:29:33.624 --> 04:29:35.559
RECORD BURBANK COMMUNITY -- BANK

04:29:35.626 --> 04:29:36.994
OR CREDIT UNION WOULD HAVE TO GO

04:29:37.060 --> 04:29:39.563
THROUGH THE SET UP.

04:29:39.630 --> 04:29:40.864
BUT A LOT BEEN SAID -- IT IN ALL

04:29:40.931 --> 04:29:42.566
REPEAT SOME IS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

04:29:42.633 --> 04:29:43.734
SAID THAT TAXPAYERS DOLLARS

04:29:43.800 --> 04:29:45.769
WOULD BE AT RISK HAVING LAID OUT

04:29:45.836 --> 04:29:47.771
THAT RIGOROUS PROCESS -- THAT WE

04:29:47.838 --> 04:29:49.806
JUST LAID OUT IF IF THAT WE'RE

04:29:49.873 --> 04:29:50.774
GONNA BE THE CASE THEY WOULDN'T

04:29:50.841 --> 04:29:52.576
GET A BANK LOCAL MISS KELLY SO

04:29:52.643 --> 04:29:53.877
THE CONVERSATION IS MOOT OFF THE

04:29:53.944 --> 04:29:54.645
TABLE.

04:29:54.711 --> 04:29:57.080
ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID

04:29:57.147 --> 04:30:00.684
THAT -- DIED LOCAL BANKS WILL

04:30:00.751 --> 04:30:01.919
STOP INVESTING OUR COMMUNITIES.

04:30:01.985 --> 04:30:02.886
I ACTUALLY THINK THEY MIGHT

04:30:02.953 --> 04:30:04.721
INVEST A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE

04:30:04.788 --> 04:30:05.622
NOW THERE'S COMPETITION THERE'S

04:30:05.689 --> 04:30:07.758
A THERE'S A MOTIVE TO INVEST

04:30:07.824 --> 04:30:09.660
MORE -- I THINK COMPETITION IS

04:30:09.726 --> 04:30:11.595
ALWAYS HELPED US QUITE FRANKLY I

04:30:11.662 --> 04:30:12.829
DON'T SEE IT SITUATION WHERE

04:30:12.896 --> 04:30:13.931
HASN'T HELP THE CONSUMER HOUSE

04:30:13.997 --> 04:30:15.632
AND HELP THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY.

04:30:15.699 --> 04:30:17.034
YOU CAN ARGUE DIFFERENT BUT I'VE

04:30:17.100 --> 04:30:19.603
SEEN IT DIFFERENTLY -- THAT THAT

04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:20.771
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOSS OF JOBS --

04:30:20.837 --> 04:30:22.873
QUICKLY LOOK AT PUBLIC VANCE'S

04:30:22.940 --> 04:30:25.576
JOB CREATORS -- THE ABILITY TO

04:30:25.642 --> 04:30:26.710
TO INVEST IN OUR LOCAL

04:30:26.777 --> 04:30:29.680
COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY -- TO TO

04:30:29.746 --> 04:30:30.581
USE THOSE DOLLARS AT A LOCAL

04:30:30.647 --> 04:30:31.748
LEVEL ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD

04:30:31.815 --> 04:30:32.716
FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY I WOULD

04:30:32.783 --> 04:30:33.850
ARGUE AS OPPOSED TO TAKING THOSE

04:30:33.917 --> 04:30:35.586
DOLLARS AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE

04:30:35.652 --> 04:30:36.587
ELSE IN ANOTHER AREA FOR

04:30:36.653 --> 04:30:37.621
INVESTMENT.

04:30:37.688 --> 04:30:39.590
I MEAN IT'S IT'S ITS BEEN SAID

04:30:39.656 --> 04:30:40.657
TO THAT THE THE CORPORATE BANK

04:30:40.724 --> 04:30:42.059
WOULD HAVE A OUR BEST INTERESTS

04:30:42.125 --> 04:30:42.626
IN MIND.

04:30:42.693 --> 04:30:44.795
SOME MIGHT -- BUT I MIGHT ARGUE

04:30:44.861 --> 04:30:46.663
THAT THAT THEIR INTEREST OUR TO

04:30:46.730 --> 04:30:47.864
SHAREHOLDERS -- IN AND AT THE

04:30:47.931 --> 04:30:49.566
END OF THE DAY IT'S THE PROFIT

04:30:49.633 --> 04:30:51.568
MOTIVE THAT WORKS AND THE BOTTOM

04:30:51.635 --> 04:30:52.135
LINE THAT'S AT THE CORE OF

04:30:52.202 --> 04:30:53.870
INTERESTS -- SO I'D ARGUE THAT

04:30:53.937 --> 04:30:56.573
THE REPUBLIC BANK -- IS REALLY

04:30:56.640 --> 04:30:58.609
IT IS A SERIOUS POLICY PROPOSAL

04:30:58.675 --> 04:31:00.043
AND AND LET'S THINK WHAT THIS

04:31:00.110 --> 04:31:02.012
PROPOSAL REALLY DOES NOT SAYING

04:31:02.079 --> 04:31:03.947
THIS -- YOU'RE SETTING UP A

04:31:04.014 --> 04:31:04.948
STATE BANK IT'S NOT SAYING IT'S

04:31:05.015 --> 04:31:05.616
MANDATED.

04:31:05.682 --> 04:31:07.684
IT'S SAYING THAT IF A LOCAL

04:31:07.751 --> 04:31:09.820
MUNICIPALITY WANTS TO GO THROUGH

04:31:09.886 --> 04:31:10.621
THE PROCESS.

04:31:10.687 --> 04:31:12.789
IN A GET PASS MUSTER THROUGH ALL

04:31:12.856 --> 04:31:15.025
THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY

04:31:15.092 --> 04:31:15.626
BEEN SET.

04:31:15.692 --> 04:31:17.094
I DON'T WANNA LIST AGAIN BUT

04:31:17.160 --> 04:31:18.629
NONE THE LESS.

04:31:18.695 --> 04:31:19.630
THEN AND ONLY THEN.

04:31:19.696 --> 04:31:22.633
CAN ACTUALLY SET ONE UP.

04:31:22.699 --> 04:31:28.639
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

04:31:28.705 --> 04:31:31.608

04:32:33.804 --> 04:32:35.572

ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SOLUTION

04:35:08.859 --> 04:35:10.660
PRESSURE TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC

PAVED THE WATER FLOWING.

04:35:19.236 --> 04:35:20.971
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

04:35:21.037 --> 04:35:21.705
FIRESTORM OUR DISTRICT WAS

04:35:21.771 --> 04:35:22.906
HEAVILY AFFECTED BY THE FIRE SO

04:35:22.973 --> 04:35:24.674
WE ALSO LEARN THAT WE HAVE A LOT

04:35:24.741 --> 04:35:26.776
OF INFRASTRUCTURE WORK TO DO TO

04:35:26.843 --> 04:35:29.613
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT FIRE STORM --

04:35:29.679 --> 04:35:31.648
AS MANY PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY

04:35:31.715 --> 04:35:32.649
HAVE SHOWN TO BE VERY VULNERABLE.

04:35:32.716 --> 04:35:33.950
AS WELL WE ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO

04:35:34.017 --> 04:35:35.619
MAKE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

04:35:35.685 --> 04:35:37.654
IMPROVEMENTS FOR INCREASED.

04:35:37.721 --> 04:35:38.855
DENSITY FOR MORE AFFORDABLE

04:35:38.922 --> 04:35:41.625
HOUSING -- THIS IS TENS OF

04:35:41.691 --> 04:35:42.626
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTMENTS

04:35:42.692 --> 04:35:44.594
THAT ARE MEDIAN SIGNIFICANT WHEN

04:35:44.661 --> 04:35:45.028
IT COMES TO IMPROVE

04:35:45.095 --> 04:35:45.929
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AFFORDABLE

04:35:45.996 --> 04:35:48.632
HOUSING THAT THE UNDERLYING COST

04:35:48.698 --> 04:35:49.633
SHOULD NOT BE LOST AND ANY OF US.

04:35:49.699 --> 04:35:50.901
IT IS COMMON FOR THE COST OF

04:35:50.967 --> 04:35:52.669
THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO

04:35:52.736 --> 04:35:53.770
BE DOUBLED BY THE FINANCING

04:35:53.837 --> 04:35:54.871
COSTS WHETHER THROUGH BONTA

04:35:54.938 --> 04:35:56.640
TRADITIONAL BANK LENDING.

04:35:56.706 --> 04:35:58.575
SO WHEN WE LOOKED OF CASH FUND

04:35:58.642 --> 04:35:59.676
WE LOOKED OF CASH FUNDS MANY OF

04:35:59.743 --> 04:36:00.810
THESE PROJECTS AS WE POSSIBLY

04:36:00.877 --> 04:36:01.878
CAN BUT THIS OF COURSE IT

04:36:01.945 --> 04:36:04.614
EXPOSES US -- TO INFLATIONARY

04:36:04.681 --> 04:36:05.181
PRESSURE BECAUSE IT PUSHED

04:36:05.248 --> 04:36:07.651
PROJECTS FAR OFF INTO THE FUTURE.

04:36:07.717 --> 04:36:09.619
ON THE SAME PROJECT COST USING

04:36:09.686 --> 04:36:10.820
LENDING MODELS FOUND UNDER THE

04:36:10.887 --> 04:36:12.689
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA --

04:36:12.756 --> 04:36:14.591
FINANCING MODELS SHOW SIGNAL

04:36:14.658 --> 04:36:15.592
THESE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY

04:36:15.659 --> 04:36:16.927
REDUCED THIS ALLOWS EITHER FOR

04:36:16.993 --> 04:36:18.561
HIGHER QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE

04:36:18.628 --> 04:36:19.596
PROJECTS.

04:36:19.663 --> 04:36:20.764
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

04:36:20.830 --> 04:36:21.865
GETTING DONE MORE MILES PIPE IN

04:36:21.932 --> 04:36:24.768

OUR TAXPAYERS.

04:36:25.702 --> 04:36:26.870
ON THE DEPOSITING A PUBLIC FUNDS

04:36:26.937 --> 04:36:28.705

CONCLUDED.

04:46:23.699 --> 04:46:25.668
THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS COST IN

04:46:27.737 --> 04:46:29.772
OPERATION OF A BANK AN ENORMOUS

04:46:29.839 --> 04:46:31.641
RISK TO TAXPAYERS.

04:46:31.707 --> 04:46:33.042
IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE LOS

MADE SMALL BUSINESS LOANS.

04:46:38.681 --> 04:46:40.950
AND 40% OF THOSE LOANS WERE

04:46:41.017 --> 04:46:42.785
CHARGED OFF A CHARGE OFF AS A

04:46:42.852 --> 04:46:44.854

ANSWER TO THE TAXPAYER.

04:46:48.691 --> 04:46:50.793
WHEN A PRIVATE BANK HAS LOSSES

04:46:50.860 --> 04:46:52.828
IT HAS TO ANSWER -- YOU KNOW HAS

04:46:52.895 --> 04:46:55.598

TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TO VOTE

04:46:59.635 --> 04:47:02.572
NO THERE'S A LOT IN THIS BILL

04:47:02.638 --> 04:47:03.806
THAT'S LACKING -- ONE OF THE

04:47:03.873 --> 04:47:05.641
THINGS THAT I THINK IT IS

04:47:05.708 --> 04:47:07.577
NOTABLE IS THAT.

04:47:07.643 --> 04:47:08.844
WHEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TO

04:47:08.911 --> 04:47:10.880
COMPETE WENT WHEN IT WHEN THE

04:47:10.947 --> 04:47:12.648
PUBLIC ENTITY ENGAGES IN

04:47:12.715 --> 04:47:14.550
COMMERCE IN COMPETITION WITH A

04:47:14.617 --> 04:47:16.619
PRIVATE ENTITY IT OUGHT TO BE?

04:47:16.686 --> 04:47:18.688
REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES THIS BILL

04:47:18.754 --> 04:47:21.791
ACTUALLY ESTABLISHES A SEPARATE

04:47:21.857 --> 04:47:22.858
CORPORATE STRUCTURE.

04:47:22.925 --> 04:47:23.726
THAT CORPORATION SHOULD PAY

04:47:23.793 --> 04:47:24.760
INCOME TAXES THE BILL

04:47:24.827 --> 04:47:26.762
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT WOULD

04:47:26.829 --> 04:47:27.630
NOT PAY INCOME TAXES.

04:47:27.697 --> 04:47:28.931
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN

04:47:28.998 --> 04:47:30.666
CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT POINT 8% THE

04:47:30.733 --> 04:47:33.569
BANK TAX RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS

04:47:33.636 --> 04:47:35.605
TEN POINT 8% SO IT'S A HIGHER

04:47:35.671 --> 04:47:36.606
NUMBER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX

04:47:36.672 --> 04:47:37.974
RATE WHEN YOU'RE TAKING INCOME

04:47:38.040 --> 04:47:38.641
PRODUCING.

04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:40.676
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TAXABLE AWAY

04:47:40.743 --> 04:47:41.811
FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN

04:47:41.877 --> 04:47:43.813
TRANSFERRING TO THEM TO A PUBLIC

04:47:43.879 --> 04:47:45.581
ANDY THAT'S NOT PAYING TAXES

04:47:45.648 --> 04:47:47.883
THERE WILL BE A HIT TO THE

04:47:47.950 --> 04:47:48.618
GENERAL FUND.

04:47:48.684 --> 04:47:49.919
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

04:47:49.986 --> 04:47:51.754
HERE TODAY THERE IS NOTHING IN

04:47:51.821 --> 04:47:54.557
THE BILL THAT STIPULATES THAT HE

04:47:54.624 --> 04:47:56.592
PUBLIC BANK HAS TO ADHERE TO ALL

04:47:56.659 --> 04:47:57.627
FEDERAL BANKING LAWS.

04:47:57.693 --> 04:47:59.662
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE

04:47:59.729 --> 04:48:00.696
BILL THAT SAYS THE MEASURE THAT

04:48:00.763 --> 04:48:02.665
OUR PUBLIC BANK HAS TO ADHERE TO

04:48:02.732 --> 04:48:04.634
THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

04:48:04.700 --> 04:48:06.736
WAR OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED

04:48:06.802 --> 04:48:08.771
SWEEPING PRIVACY LEGISLATION

04:48:08.838 --> 04:48:10.706
THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED

04:48:10.773 --> 04:48:13.776
NEXT YEAR IT OUGHT TO HAVE THAT

04:48:13.843 --> 04:48:14.610
IN THE BILL.

04:48:14.677 --> 04:48:16.579
FINALLY IF THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S

04:48:16.646 --> 04:48:17.913
MONEY IF IT'S ABOUT LOCAL

04:48:17.980 --> 04:48:20.583
CONTROL THEN WE SHOULD SHOULD

04:48:20.650 --> 04:48:21.717
JACK THIS TO A VOTE OF THE

04:48:21.784 --> 04:48:23.686

04:48:24.754 --> 04:48:27.590
MEASURE V. IN LA WHETHER OR NOT

04:48:27.657 --> 04:48:28.724
THEY WANT TO CREATE A PUBLIC

04:48:28.791 --> 04:48:29.625
BANK.

FROM THE BANKING LOBBYISTS AND

04:50:39.822 --> 04:50:41.557
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE

04:50:41.624 --> 04:50:43.526
ARGUMENTS HAVE SHIFTED BETWEEN

04:50:43.592 --> 04:50:44.560

04:50:47.630 --> 04:50:48.597
FEW THINGS?

FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A

04:50:49.832 --> 04:50:50.599
SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW.

04:50:50.666 --> 04:50:52.701
THE PROCESS INVOLVES A VERY

04:50:52.768 --> 04:50:53.669
LENGTHY ANALYSIS ON A

04:50:53.736 --> 04:50:55.604
FEASIBILITY STUDY.

04:50:55.671 --> 04:50:57.573
AND THE BANKING LOBBY SUGGEST

04:50:57.640 --> 04:50:58.574
THERE'S NOT A VOTE THAT IS NOT

04:50:58.641 --> 04:51:02.578
TRUE IN FACT I WILL JUST SAY --

04:51:02.645 --> 04:51:05.581
IT IS IN ACTUALLY THE LOCAL

04:51:05.648 --> 04:51:06.749
GOVERNMENTS ANNOUNCES ITSELF ON

04:51:06.816 --> 04:51:09.552
PAGE NINE SAYS THE STUDY THAT'S

04:51:09.618 --> 04:51:10.653
REQUIRED MUST BE PRESENTED AN

04:51:10.719 --> 04:51:12.588
APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BODY

04:51:12.655 --> 04:51:13.722
OF THE LOCAL AGENCY.

04:51:13.789 --> 04:51:15.691
AT A PUBLIC MEETING PRIOR TO THE

04:51:15.758 --> 04:51:16.826
LOCAL AGENCY SUBMITTING AN

04:51:16.892 --> 04:51:19.562
APPLICATION WE HAVE NO INTEREST

04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:21.564
IN A LOCAL JURISDICTION MOVING

04:51:21.630 --> 04:51:22.932
FOR WITH THIS WITHOUT PUBLIC

04:51:22.998 --> 04:51:23.599
OFFICIALS.

04:51:23.666 --> 04:51:25.701
ANALYZING THE DATA AND FIGURED

04:51:25.768 --> 04:51:26.802
OUT SO POINT NUMBER.

04:51:26.869 --> 04:51:27.603
ONE UP.

04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:29.972
NUMBER TWO THERE'S A SUGGESTION

04:51:30.039 --> 04:51:31.807
THAT SOMEHOW -- THIS IS GOING TO

04:51:31.874 --> 04:51:33.742
KILL COMMUNITY BANKS AND I COULD

04:51:33.809 --> 04:51:35.644
NOT DISAGREE WITHOUT MORE

04:51:35.711 --> 04:51:36.579
STRONGLY.

04:51:36.645 --> 04:51:38.647
THE LAW OUR BILLS SPECIFICALLY

04:51:38.714 --> 04:51:39.582
SAYS.

04:51:39.648 --> 04:51:41.650
THAT ANY LOCAL PUBLIC BANK WOULD

04:51:41.717 --> 04:51:43.652
BE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH

04:51:43.719 --> 04:51:45.621
COMMUNITY BANKS IN FACT QUITE

04:51:45.688 --> 04:51:46.755
THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED IN

04:51:46.822 --> 04:51:48.557
RECENT YEARS THE WALL STREET

04:51:48.624 --> 04:51:49.525
BANKS.

04:51:49.592 --> 04:51:51.627
HAVE ACTUALLY KILLED 75% OF

04:51:51.694 --> 04:51:53.629
CALIFORNIA LOCAL BANKS OVER THE

04:51:53.696 --> 04:51:55.564
PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN

04:51:55.631 --> 04:51:56.565
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WERE

04:51:56.632 --> 04:51:57.633
FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITY BANKS.

04:51:57.700 --> 04:51:59.602
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:51:59.668 --> 04:52:00.636
THIS YEAR THERE HUNDRED AND

04:52:00.703 --> 04:52:03.539
TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES

04:52:03.606 --> 04:52:04.807
OF THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS

04:52:04.874 --> 04:52:06.575
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

04:52:06.642 --> 04:52:08.510
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN NORTH

04:52:08.577 --> 04:52:08.744
DAKOTA.

04:52:08.811 --> 04:52:10.779
IS COMMUNITY BY THE COMMUNITY

04:52:10.846 --> 04:52:11.947
BANKING SYSTEM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

04:52:12.014 --> 04:52:15.584
ENHANCED BY THE EXISTENCE OF A

04:52:15.651 --> 04:52:17.553
PUBLIC BANK -- I WANT TO ADDRESS

04:52:17.620 --> 04:52:19.722
THE THE JOB KILLER SUGGESTION BY

04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:21.557
THE CHAMBER WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

04:52:21.624 --> 04:52:22.858
THE WALL STREET BANKS WERE

04:52:22.925 --> 04:52:24.560
TALKING ABOUT DESTROYED

04:52:24.627 --> 04:52:26.595
COUNTLESS JOBS.

04:52:26.662 --> 04:52:27.529
WITH THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS

04:52:27.596 --> 04:52:29.665
COUNTLESS JOBS RELATED TO THE

04:52:29.732 --> 04:52:30.666
MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES CRISIS

04:52:30.733 --> 04:52:32.835
COUNTLESS JOBS THAT ARE IMPACTED

04:52:32.902 --> 04:52:34.536
BECAUSE A PREDATORY LENDING OF

04:52:34.603 --> 04:52:35.738
THE FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

04:52:35.804 --> 04:52:37.573
HAVE NOT BEEN LIED.

04:52:37.640 --> 04:52:38.540
TO AND OUR VISION OF PUBLIC

04:52:38.607 --> 04:52:39.875
BANKS IS THAT THEY ARE JOB

04:52:39.942 --> 04:52:41.844
CREATORS THAT THEY ARE INVESTING

04:52:41.911 --> 04:52:43.679
IN LOCAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING

04:52:43.746 --> 04:52:44.747
THEY'RE INVESTING IN LOCAL

04:52:44.813 --> 04:52:46.548
INFRASTRUCTURE IN LOCAL SMALL

04:52:46.615 --> 04:52:49.518
BUSINESSES. TO ENSURE THAT WE

04:52:49.585 --> 04:52:51.720
ARE CREATING JOBS -- THE LAST

04:52:51.787 --> 04:52:53.622
POINT I WANT TO MENTION IS

04:52:53.689 --> 04:52:56.558
AROUND -- THE POINT INVOLVING

04:52:56.625 --> 04:52:58.527
TAXATION BECAUSE THAT IS

04:52:58.594 --> 04:53:00.696
SOMETHING THAT -- THAT HAS BEEN

04:53:00.763 --> 04:53:01.563
SUGGESTED.

04:53:01.630 --> 04:53:03.499
I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THE

04:53:03.565 --> 04:53:05.501
CREDIT UNION'S RIGHTFULLY ARE

04:53:05.567 --> 04:53:07.536
TAX EXEMPT BECAUSE THEY EXISTS

04:53:07.603 --> 04:53:08.671
TO SERVE THEIR MEMBERS NOT TO

04:53:08.737 --> 04:53:10.606
MAKE A PROFIT FOR INVESTORS FOR

04:53:10.673 --> 04:53:12.574
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS.

04:53:12.641 --> 04:53:14.677
THAT HAVE INVESTORS IS OUR

04:53:14.743 --> 04:53:17.546
BOTTOM LINE THEY ARE TAXED BUT

04:53:17.613 --> 04:53:18.580
NONPROFIT.

04:53:18.647 --> 04:53:20.549
ENTITIES GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

04:53:20.616 --> 04:53:22.651
ARE NOT TAX BECAUSE THEY HAVE

04:53:22.718 --> 04:53:25.554
THE PUBLIC GOOD AS THEIR NUMBER

04:53:25.621 --> 04:53:27.556
ONE FIGHT DO SHERRY -- OBJECTIVE

04:53:27.623 --> 04:53:29.625
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES OUT

04:53:29.692 --> 04:53:31.827
REQUIRES PUBLIC BANKS TO HAVE A

04:53:31.894 --> 04:53:33.696
FIGHT JUDICIARY DUTY TO THE

04:53:33.762 --> 04:53:35.531
PUBLIC AND TO THE PUBLIC ASSETS

04:53:35.597 --> 04:53:37.633
AND THAT IS WHY WE TREAT THEM.

04:53:37.700 --> 04:53:40.569
IN THIS BILL LIKE A CREDIT UNION

04:53:40.636 --> 04:53:42.571
IF WALL STREET BANKS.

04:53:42.638 --> 04:53:44.573
WERE NOT BASED ON THE PROFIT

04:53:44.640 --> 04:53:46.642
MOTIVE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

04:53:46.709 --> 04:53:47.810
PAY TAXES BUT THE FACT AMOUNT OF

04:53:47.876 --> 04:53:48.610
DATA THEY DO.

04:53:48.677 --> 04:53:50.612
THAT IS HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR TAX

04:53:50.679 --> 04:53:52.881
SYSTEM OUR IN OUR OUR COUNTRY SO

04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:54.950
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THOSE

04:53:55.017 --> 04:53:55.584
POINTS.

04:53:55.651 --> 04:53:57.720
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT LOS

04:53:57.786 --> 04:53:58.587

WHAT WAS THE?

04:54:06.662 --> 04:54:07.830
WE LOOK AT THE OTHER WAY STREET

04:54:09.732 --> 04:54:11.567
GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT -- WITH

CLOSE 2405%.

04:54:15.671 --> 04:54:17.606
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD MOVE.

04:54:17.673 --> 04:54:19.641

04:55:01.617 --> 04:55:03.519
ISSUE YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

04:55:03.585 --> 04:55:04.653
AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING --

04:55:04.720 --> 04:55:11.560

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU

TO BOTH -- AUTHORS FOR THE

04:55:15.731 --> 04:55:16.832
ONGOING DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE BEEN

04:55:16.899 --> 04:55:18.767
HAVING OVER THIS TOPIC I THINK

04:55:18.834 --> 04:55:19.668
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT MORE.

04:55:19.735 --> 04:55:21.770
ABOUT BANKING -- IN ALL THESE

04:55:21.837 --> 04:55:22.738
AREAS THAT ARE THERE.

04:55:22.805 --> 04:55:25.607
CERTAINLY -- THE THE BANKING IN

04:55:25.674 --> 04:55:26.542
THE MEMBERS THAT CAME THERE

04:55:26.608 --> 04:55:28.677
STARTED TO ADDRESS -- SOME OF

04:55:28.744 --> 04:55:30.579
THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED.

04:55:30.646 --> 04:55:32.614
HOWEVER WE WE STILL AND WE HEAR

04:55:32.681 --> 04:55:33.615
IN THE PRESENTATION THE

04:55:33.682 --> 04:55:35.651
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIVATE

04:55:35.717 --> 04:55:36.685
SECTOR CORPORATIONS VERSUS

04:55:36.752 --> 04:55:38.587
TAXPAYERS MONEY.

04:55:38.654 --> 04:55:40.522
WHEN TAXPAYERS MONEY IS AT RISK

04:55:40.589 --> 04:55:42.624
I THINK WE ALL OF US MORE OF A

04:55:42.691 --> 04:55:43.559
STRINGENT?

04:55:43.625 --> 04:55:45.694
ON OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:55:45.761 --> 04:55:47.529
THE RISK TOLERANCE IS THERE FOR

04:55:47.596 --> 04:55:48.697
ANY MUNICIPALITY -- THIS

04:55:48.764 --> 04:55:51.533
CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AND

04:55:51.600 --> 04:55:52.568
AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING HARD

04:55:52.634 --> 04:55:53.535
ON IT.

04:55:53.602 --> 04:55:55.504
BUT IT BECOMES THAT RISK

04:55:55.571 --> 04:55:57.606
TOLERANCE THAT THE TAXPAYERS IN

04:55:57.673 --> 04:56:00.576
THE COMMUNITIES -- ARE SUFFERING.

04:56:00.642 --> 04:56:02.544
WHEREAS IN IN THE SHAREHOLDERS

04:56:02.611 --> 04:56:03.612
THEY'RE PUTTING IN PRIVATE

04:56:03.679 --> 04:56:04.780
DOLLARS THEY KNOW THE RISK

04:56:04.847 --> 04:56:06.548
TOLERANCE BEFORE THEY EVEN GET

04:56:06.615 --> 04:56:08.517
INTO IT SO IF A BANK.

04:56:08.584 --> 04:56:09.551
OR SOMETHING FINANCIAL

04:56:09.618 --> 04:56:11.787
INSTITUTIONS STARS TO HIT THESE

04:56:11.854 --> 04:56:13.522
DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS THEY START

04:56:13.589 --> 04:56:14.857
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE MAKING

04:56:14.923 --> 04:56:16.492
CHANGES TO PROTECT.

04:56:16.558 --> 04:56:17.793
THAT ONGOING INVESTMENT THAT'S

04:56:17.860 --> 04:56:19.661
THERE AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

04:56:19.728 --> 04:56:21.597
WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOW

04:56:21.663 --> 04:56:22.631
THE GOVERNMENTAL SCHEME.

04:56:22.698 --> 04:56:24.533
THE GOVERNMENTAL SCHEME I KNOW

04:56:24.600 --> 04:56:26.602
I'VE ASK QUESTIONS AS FAR AS HOW

04:56:26.668 --> 04:56:28.537
MUCH WOULD BE THE THE CAPITAL

04:56:28.604 --> 04:56:30.506
OUTLAY FOR SOME OF THESE UP --

04:56:30.572 --> 04:56:31.507
TO MANY CITIES ARE

04:56:31.573 --> 04:56:32.608
MUNICIPALITIES IT WILL MOVE

04:56:32.674 --> 04:56:33.842
FORWARD AND THEY FINANCIALLY

04:56:33.909 --> 04:56:36.512
SOUND AND I KNOW -- IT IS THAT

04:56:36.578 --> 04:56:37.646
WE DISCUSSED THAT AND SOME OF

04:56:37.713 --> 04:56:38.747
THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF

04:56:38.814 --> 04:56:40.649
BANKING -- STARTS TO LOOK AT

04:56:40.716 --> 04:56:41.650
SOME OF THE PLANS WILL BE

04:56:41.717 --> 04:56:45.521
FORWARD ON A FIVE YEAR PRO FORMA --

04:56:45.587 --> 04:56:48.524
SHEET ON IT PRO FORMAS ESTIMATE

04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:49.758
ADJUSTMENTS AND ALL THOSE

04:56:49.825 --> 04:56:50.325
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MOVE

04:56:50.392 --> 04:56:50.659
FORWARD.

04:56:50.726 --> 04:56:53.595
HOWEVER WE WE STILL LOOK AT THE

04:56:53.662 --> 04:56:55.531
INITIAL OUTLAY VERSUS PRIVATE

04:56:55.597 --> 04:56:57.566
DOLLARS AND INVESTORS COMING IN.

04:56:57.633 --> 04:56:59.568
AND MELISSA PARODIES WITH THE

04:56:59.635 --> 04:57:01.570
THE INFLUX OF TAXPAYERS MONEY

04:57:01.637 --> 04:57:02.538
BEING.

04:57:02.604 --> 04:57:04.506
IN THOSE AREAS IN THE SAFE CARS

04:57:04.573 --> 04:57:05.541
THAT ARE THERE.

04:57:05.607 --> 04:57:06.575
THERE STILL IS QUESTIONS THE

04:57:06.642 --> 04:57:12.581
THAT I DO HAVE -- YOU KNOW AS

04:57:12.648 --> 04:57:14.716
FAR AS THE STAR UP OF USING

04:57:14.783 --> 04:57:15.784
TAXPAYERS DOLLARS TO FOR A START

04:57:15.851 --> 04:57:16.618
UP BUSINESS WHEN WE KNOW THAT

04:57:16.685 --> 04:57:17.286
IT'S IT'S A RISKY BUSINESS RIGHT

04:57:17.352 --> 04:57:17.853
LOANING MONEY OUT AND DOING

04:57:17.920 --> 04:57:18.687
THESE DIFFERENT THINGS.

04:57:18.754 --> 04:57:20.556
OR ELSE THERE WOULDN'T BE -- A

04:57:20.622 --> 04:57:22.524
RISK TOLERANCE AND SOME OF THE

04:57:22.591 --> 04:57:23.725
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE SEEN IN

04:57:23.792 --> 04:57:25.527
HISTORY WITH -- SAVINGS AND

04:57:25.594 --> 04:57:27.529
LOANS OR THE BANKING INDUSTRY

04:57:27.596 --> 04:57:28.730
WHERE WE SEEN SOME BAIL OUT FOR

04:57:28.797 --> 04:57:30.732
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE TO

04:57:30.799 --> 04:57:32.034
THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS SOME OF

04:57:32.100 --> 04:57:33.535
THESE AREAS.

04:57:33.602 --> 04:57:34.536
SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT.

04:57:34.603 --> 04:57:36.705
THERE'S NO RISK TO IT THERE IS

04:57:36.772 --> 04:57:38.540
RISK TOLERANCE TO IT SO NOT

04:57:38.607 --> 04:57:39.942
KNOWING WHAT THAT RISK TOLERANCE

04:57:40.008 --> 04:57:42.544
IS ON WE CONTINUE.

04:57:42.611 --> 04:57:44.613
TO BE OPEN TO DIALOGUE THAT

04:57:44.680 --> 04:57:45.547
THAT'S THAT'S THERE AND AS WELL

04:57:45.614 --> 04:57:47.616

04:57:47.683 --> 04:57:48.584
OF THE SUPPORT IT'S THERE.

04:57:48.650 --> 04:57:51.520
BUT YET THERE STILL IS SOME SOME

04:57:51.587 --> 04:57:52.588
HARD QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED --

04:57:52.654 --> 04:57:54.656
EVEN AT THIS POINT NIGHT THANK

ADDRESS SOME IS JUST A COMPLEX

04:57:59.595 --> 04:57:59.761
ISSUE.

04:57:59.828 --> 04:58:01.863
AND HOPEFULLY AS THE BILL MOVES

04:58:01.930 --> 04:58:03.599
FORWARD WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT

04:58:03.665 --> 04:58:05.534
MORE CLARITY ON IT THAT WE WILL

04:58:05.601 --> 04:58:06.568
KEEP AN OPEN MIND TO IT.

04:58:06.635 --> 04:58:09.538
BUT TODAY I'M IN A RESERVE MY

04:58:09.605 --> 04:58:12.975
VOTE -- TO NOT SUPPORT THIS WILL

PUBLIC DOLLAR -- AND PEOPLE

04:59:20.742 --> 04:59:21.677
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT SOME POINT

04:59:21.743 --> 04:59:22.311
IN TIME A PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH

04:59:22.377 --> 04:59:22.911

JUST A STEP FORWARD IN IN THAT

04:59:32.688 --> 04:59:33.922
SAME FRAME OF THOUGHT THAT WOULD

04:59:33.989 --> 04:59:35.691
THERE IS POSSIBILITY THAT TO

04:59:35.757 --> 04:59:37.592
HAVE A PUBLIC BANK -- WE'RE NOT

04:59:37.659 --> 04:59:38.593

THIS IS -- I WOULD CONSIDER A

05:00:01.883 --> 05:00:03.652
HISTORIC VOTE TO KEEP MOVING

05:00:03.719 --> 05:00:04.553
THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION.

05:00:04.619 --> 05:00:07.489
FOR AND I HOPE A MOST OF YOU --

05:00:07.556 --> 05:00:09.591

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS

05:00:14.696 --> 05:00:17.532
AND BASICALLY WANT TO THANK --

05:00:17.599 --> 05:00:18.667
MISTER ROBERTS AND EACH OF YOU

05:00:18.734 --> 05:00:19.701
WHO HAVE ENGAGE WITH US VERY

05:00:19.768 --> 05:00:20.869
DEEPLY ON THIS AND AND I WANT TO

05:00:20.936 --> 05:00:22.671
JUST MAKE THREE POINTS THE FIRST

05:00:22.738 --> 05:00:24.539
IS AROUND RICK'S RISK TOLERANCE.

05:00:24.606 --> 05:00:26.508
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT

05:00:26.575 --> 05:00:28.510
QUITE A BIT BECAUSE AS AUTHORS

05:00:28.577 --> 05:00:29.811
OF THIS WE DO NOT WANT TO SET UP

05:00:29.878 --> 05:00:31.513
A SCENARIO FOR ANY THESE PUBLIC

05:00:31.580 --> 05:00:32.547
BANKS TO FAIL.

05:00:32.614 --> 05:00:33.815
AND THIS IS WHY THE REQUIREMENTS

05:00:33.882 --> 05:00:36.618
IN THIS BILL ARE SO ONEROUS THAT

05:00:36.685 --> 05:00:38.520
IT ACTUALLY WILL BE VERY VERY

05:00:38.587 --> 05:00:39.755
DIFFICULT FOR ANY LOCAL

05:00:39.821 --> 05:00:41.623
JURISDICTION TO MEET ALL THESE

05:00:41.690 --> 05:00:42.758
REQUIREMENTS TO BE ABLE TO

05:00:42.824 --> 05:00:43.759
CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK.

05:00:43.825 --> 05:00:46.528
AND THAT IS INTENTIONAL BECAUSE

05:00:46.595 --> 05:00:48.497
AS YOU SAID WE DO NOT WANT TO

05:00:48.563 --> 05:00:50.565
SET UP A SITUATION TO FAIL.

05:00:50.632 --> 05:00:51.767
AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I WOULD

05:00:51.833 --> 05:00:53.702
NOT OF INTRODUCED THIS BILL.

05:00:53.769 --> 05:00:57.773
IF. ELEVEN OF THE ELEVEN MEMBERS

05:00:57.839 --> 05:00:58.673
OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF

05:00:58.740 --> 05:01:00.509
SUPERVISORS OF MY JURISDICTION

05:01:00.575 --> 05:01:01.743
HAD NOT PUT THEIR NAME TO SAME

05:01:01.810 --> 05:01:02.911
WE MIGHT NEED TO DO THIS.

05:01:02.978 --> 05:01:04.479
AFTER.

05:01:04.546 --> 05:01:06.548
DEEP ANALYSIS THAT DID SHOW.

05:01:06.615 --> 05:01:08.650
THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

05:01:08.717 --> 05:01:09.551
CAPITAL.

05:01:09.618 --> 05:01:11.520
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A NUMBER OF

05:01:11.586 --> 05:01:12.754
YEARS TO GET THESE UP AND

05:01:12.821 --> 05:01:14.689
RUNNING BUT EVEN WITH THAT RISK

05:01:14.756 --> 05:01:16.558
PROFILE.

05:01:16.625 --> 05:01:18.493
ALL OF MY LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE

05:01:18.560 --> 05:01:19.728
ASKED ME AND ASKED US TO MOVE

05:01:19.795 --> 05:01:20.829
FOR THE BILL TO GIVE THEM A

05:01:20.896 --> 05:01:22.497
CHANCE TO DO THIS.

05:01:22.564 --> 05:01:23.532
THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY

05:01:23.598 --> 05:01:24.866
IS I KNOW THE BANKING LOBBYIST

05:01:24.933 --> 05:01:26.501
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PUTTING

05:01:26.568 --> 05:01:27.602
TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT RISK.

05:01:27.669 --> 05:01:29.538
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

05:01:29.604 --> 05:01:30.739
TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE ALREADY

05:01:30.806 --> 05:01:32.607
BEEN PUT IN RISK RIGHT NOW WITH

05:01:32.674 --> 05:01:34.743
THE STATUS QUO. SEVEN HUNDRED

05:01:34.810 --> 05:01:36.511
BILLION DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA

05:01:36.578 --> 05:01:37.679
PACKED TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE

05:01:37.746 --> 05:01:39.548
INVESTED IN THESE BANKS.

05:01:39.614 --> 05:01:41.516
AND THERE VESTED IN INSTITUTIONS

05:01:41.583 --> 05:01:43.485
THAT ARE FAILING OUR CONSUMERS

05:01:43.552 --> 05:01:44.519
THAT OUR FAMILY ARE HOMEOWNERS

05:01:44.586 --> 05:01:45.754
THAT ARE FAILING OR SMALL

05:01:45.821 --> 05:01:47.589
BUSINESSES THAT ARE FAILING OUR

05:01:47.656 --> 05:01:49.491
STUDENTS THERE PUT INSTANCE INTO

05:01:49.558 --> 05:01:50.559
INSTITUTIONS.

05:01:50.625 --> 05:01:53.528
THAT ARE OUR THAT ARE INVESTING

05:01:53.595 --> 05:01:55.530
IN GUN MANUFACTURERS AND FOSSIL

05:01:55.597 --> 05:01:57.766
FUEL INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES

05:01:57.833 --> 05:01:58.834
WITH UNFAIR PRACTICES.

05:01:58.900 --> 05:02:00.635
AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

05:02:00.702 --> 05:02:02.471
A DIFFERENT OPTION.

05:02:02.537 --> 05:02:03.572
THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS

05:02:03.638 --> 05:02:05.507
I DO KNOW THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT

05:02:05.574 --> 05:02:06.541
AND IT TAKES.

05:02:06.608 --> 05:02:08.610
TIME FOR FOLKS TO WRAP THEIR

05:02:08.677 --> 05:02:09.744
BRAINS AROUND IT AND I VERY MUCH

05:02:09.811 --> 05:02:10.979
APPRECIATE THIS IS A HARD THING

05:02:11.046 --> 05:02:12.481
TO THINK ABOUT IT'S BEEN

05:02:12.547 --> 05:02:13.081
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING

05:02:13.148 --> 05:02:13.748
ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

05:02:13.815 --> 05:02:15.550
THERE WAS A TIME.

05:02:15.617 --> 05:02:16.785
IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN WE DID NOT

05:02:16.852 --> 05:02:18.553
HAVE.

05:02:18.620 --> 05:02:20.522
A PUBLIC HOUSING SYSTEM BECAUSE

05:02:20.589 --> 05:02:22.591
AND IT IT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE

05:02:22.657 --> 05:02:23.959
PRIVATE HOUSING SYSTEM BROKE

05:02:24.025 --> 05:02:24.559
DOWN.

05:02:24.626 --> 05:02:25.727
THERE WAS A TIME WE DIDN'T NEED

05:02:25.794 --> 05:02:27.596
A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BUT THE

05:02:27.662 --> 05:02:28.630
PRIVATE HEALTH SYSTEM BROKE DOWN

05:02:28.697 --> 05:02:29.898
THERE'S A TIME WE DIDN'T NEED

05:02:29.965 --> 05:02:30.565
PUBLIC TRANSIT.

05:02:30.632 --> 05:02:31.967
BUT THE PRIVATE TRANSIT SYSTEM

05:02:32.033 --> 05:02:33.835
BROKE DOWN AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

05:02:33.902 --> 05:02:35.770
HERE IS OUR WALL STREET BANKING

05:02:35.837 --> 05:02:37.472
SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY HAS FAILED

05:02:37.539 --> 05:02:37.639
US.

05:02:37.706 --> 05:02:38.940
AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER

05:02:39.007 --> 05:02:40.742
OPTIONS NOTHING IS GOING TO

05:02:40.809 --> 05:02:41.676

ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS QUESTION.

05:02:50.619 --> 05:02:51.753
I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE IT OUT

05:02:51.820 --> 05:02:52.654
OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I HOPE

05:02:52.721 --> 05:02:54.489

LEAD TO DIRE CONSEQUENCE

05:04:11.566 --> 05:04:12.534
CONSEQUENCES.

05:04:12.601 --> 05:04:14.703
WHEN LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE FILED

05:04:42.631 --> 05:04:44.733
BEFORE DEDICATING SUBSTANTIAL

05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:50.505

05:04:52.574 --> 05:04:54.643

05:05:11.626 --> 05:05:13.495
IS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES WILL

05:05:13.561 --> 05:05:15.563
DIVEST FROM CERTAIN INDUSTRIES.

05:05:15.630 --> 05:05:18.600
YET THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO

05:05:18.667 --> 05:05:21.536
LIMIT PUBLIC BANKS POTENTIAL

IN THE IN THE CAPITAL -- IN BEST

05:10:16.698 --> 05:10:18.633
MINUTES AND PROGRAM IS GREAT

05:10:18.700 --> 05:10:20.735
HOWEVER AT THE MANUFACTURING

05:10:20.802 --> 05:10:22.570
INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED SINCE THE

05:10:22.637 --> 05:10:24.505
CIP WAS ENACTED IN IN THE

05:10:24.572 --> 05:10:27.508
NINETIES -- SINCE THIS IT WAS

05:10:27.575 --> 05:10:28.710
ENACTED MANUFACTURING HAS GOTTEN

05:10:28.776 --> 05:10:30.578
LEANER IT'S GOTTEN SMALLER BUT

05:10:30.645 --> 05:10:32.580
MORE PRODUCTIVE IT'S FASTER --

05:10:32.647 --> 05:10:34.716
AND WE CAN PRODUCE A GREAT MANY

05:10:34.782 --> 05:10:36.651
GOODS IN FACILITIESTHAT WE

05:10:36.718 --> 05:10:38.653
COULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE --

05:10:38.720 --> 05:10:40.555
BEFORE -- SO NOW WE SEE

05:10:40.621 --> 05:10:41.756
MANUFACTURING MOVING INTO URBAN

05:10:41.823 --> 05:10:44.592
CENTERS INTO COMMERCIAL CENTERS --

05:10:44.659 --> 05:10:47.528
DOWNTOWN TO DISTRICTS -- AT A

05:10:47.595 --> 05:10:48.763
DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN

05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:50.531
PLACES WE COULDN'T BEFORE AND

05:10:50.598 --> 05:10:51.699
WHEN WE DO THAT WE ARE

05:10:51.766 --> 05:10:53.568
REVITALIZING COMMUNITIES AND

05:10:53.634 --> 05:10:55.536
DRAWING NEW INVESTMENT.

05:10:55.603 --> 05:10:58.573
THE GROWTH IN MANUFACTURING IS

05:10:58.639 --> 05:11:01.509
IN THE RANGE OF INVESTMENTS WHEN

05:11:01.576 --> 05:11:02.844
FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION

05:11:02.910 --> 05:11:05.480
DOLLARS THE MEGA INVESTMENT THAT

05:11:05.546 --> 05:11:06.547
THE SET WAS INTENDED TO ATTRACT

05:11:06.614 --> 05:11:07.882
OF A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

05:11:07.949 --> 05:11:09.617
DOLLARS OR MORE -- IS LESS THAN

05:11:09.684 --> 05:11:12.720
4% OF A MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT

05:11:12.787 --> 05:11:13.554
IN CALIFORNIA.

05:11:13.621 --> 05:11:14.822
BY COMPARISON INVESTMENTS WITH

05:11:14.889 --> 05:11:16.691
THE FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION

05:11:16.758 --> 05:11:18.526
DOLLAR RANGE ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT

05:11:18.593 --> 05:11:20.595
40% OF INVESTMENT -- AND THE

05:11:20.661 --> 05:11:22.563
NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED BY THAT

05:11:22.630 --> 05:11:23.831
INVESTMENT IS MORE THAN FOUR

05:11:23.898 --> 05:11:25.566
TIMES THE AMOUNT CREATED BY

05:11:25.633 --> 05:11:27.602
INVESTMENT OF FIFTY MILLION

05:11:27.668 --> 05:11:28.536
DOLLARS OR MORE.

05:11:28.603 --> 05:11:31.773
SO THE TARGETED REVITALIZATION

05:11:31.839 --> 05:11:32.540
IN.

05:11:32.607 --> 05:11:34.509
CENTER PROGRAM THAT WE'RE

05:11:34.575 --> 05:11:36.744
PROPOSING TO AB TWELVE FORTY

05:11:36.811 --> 05:11:37.612
EIGHT IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD

05:11:37.678 --> 05:11:38.613
PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH

05:11:38.679 --> 05:11:39.714
AN EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT WILL

05:11:39.781 --> 05:11:41.716
ATTRACT MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT

05:11:41.783 --> 05:11:44.552
WHERE IT IS TODAY.

05:11:44.619 --> 05:11:46.654
AS AN EXAMPLE -- WE CAN POINT TO

05:11:46.721 --> 05:11:49.524
A MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT IS

05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:50.591
IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO

05:11:50.658 --> 05:11:53.528
GARCIA IS DISTRICT IN RALEIGH --

05:11:53.594 --> 05:11:55.797
THERE THERE WAS A FACILITY THAT

05:11:55.863 --> 05:11:57.732
SHUT DOWN WAS RAN BY A NATIONAL

05:11:57.799 --> 05:12:01.569
FOOD -- PROCESSING CHAIN --

05:12:01.636 --> 05:12:03.771
AFTER IT LEFT WE SAW THE CITY

05:12:03.838 --> 05:12:07.508
HAD A NEARLY 25% POVERTY RATES

05:12:07.575 --> 05:12:09.510
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A SMALLER

05:12:09.577 --> 05:12:11.512
SCALED MANUFACTURER MAKING CRAFT

05:12:11.579 --> 05:12:13.514
BEEF PRODUCTS TOOK OVER IN OLD

05:12:13.581 --> 05:12:15.683
FACILITY -- AND AFTER INVESTING

05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:17.685
IN MAKING INVESTMENTS OF FORTY

05:12:17.752 --> 05:12:18.753
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEY

05:12:18.820 --> 05:12:20.922
CREATED SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY

05:12:20.988 --> 05:12:22.824
FIVE JOBS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

05:12:22.890 --> 05:12:25.526
AFTER THAT INVESTMENT WE'VE SEEN

05:12:25.593 --> 05:12:26.627
FOLLOW UP INVESTMENT IN THE FEED

05:12:26.694 --> 05:12:28.529
INDUSTRY IN THE AGRICULTURE

05:12:28.596 --> 05:12:30.531
INDUSTRY ALL OF THESE --

05:12:30.598 --> 05:12:32.533
SUBSEQUENT INSULAR INDUSTRIES

05:12:32.600 --> 05:12:33.634
THAT SUPPORT -- BEEF

05:12:33.701 --> 05:12:35.536
MANUFACTURING AND SO GROWTH

05:12:35.603 --> 05:12:37.538
COMES WITH MANUFACTURING COLUMNS

05:12:37.605 --> 05:12:38.539
THE CHALLENGE AT THAT FACILITY

05:12:38.606 --> 05:12:40.608
FACED WAS THAT THEY DID NOT HAD

05:12:40.675 --> 05:12:42.510
THAT THEY NEEDED SUPPORT MENTAL

05:12:42.577 --> 05:12:43.878
FINANCING INCENTIVES FROM LOCAL

05:12:43.945 --> 05:12:45.513
GOVERNMENTS -- TO MAKE THAT

05:12:45.580 --> 05:12:47.515
HAPPEN SO THEY WORKED WITH THEIR

05:12:47.582 --> 05:12:48.516
LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

05:12:48.583 --> 05:12:49.584

INVESTMENT SERVICES BUT THE

05:12:51.719 --> 05:12:53.588
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO A LOT

05:12:53.654 --> 05:12:54.722
OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

05:12:54.789 --> 05:12:55.756
FACILITY COULD BE SUPPORTED

05:12:55.823 --> 05:12:57.558
BEFORE COULD BE UP AND RUNNING.

05:12:57.625 --> 05:12:59.660
SO THE PROGRAM A. B. TWELVE

05:12:59.727 --> 05:13:00.528
FORTY IS TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TOOL

05:13:00.595 --> 05:13:01.796
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT

AND ADVANCED MATERIALS -- WE SEE

05:14:12.767 --> 05:14:14.569
THOSE AS AS CRITICAL FACTORS IN

05:14:14.635 --> 05:14:16.604
GROWTH AND THOSE THAT REQUIRE

05:14:16.671 --> 05:14:18.506
THAT SIZE OF A MANUFACTURING

05:14:18.573 --> 05:14:19.640
FACILITY AND WHAT WE SEE IS A

05:14:19.707 --> 05:14:20.541
SWEET SPOT.

05:14:20.608 --> 05:14:22.610
AS ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY

05:14:22.677 --> 05:14:23.144
THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED

05:14:23.211 --> 05:14:23.945
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET.

05:14:24.011 --> 05:14:25.646
ROUGHLY FIFTY EMPLOYEES TO FIVE

05:14:25.713 --> 05:14:26.714
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT'S THE

05:14:26.781 --> 05:14:28.516
BULK OF OUR PROSPECTS PROSPECTS

05:14:28.583 --> 05:14:29.717
ARE WHAT WE CALL COMPANIES.

05:14:29.784 --> 05:14:31.686
AND INVESTORS THAT ARE WANTING

05:14:31.752 --> 05:14:32.687
TO GET INVOLVED IN THE

05:14:32.753 --> 05:14:34.589
CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE AND WE

05:14:34.655 --> 05:14:37.558
WORK WITH ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS.

05:14:37.625 --> 05:14:38.726
WE THINK THAT -- THIS BELT

05:14:38.793 --> 05:14:40.595
REALLY FIT STOCK MARKET VERY

05:14:40.661 --> 05:14:42.563
WELL TARGETED VERY WELL AND

05:14:42.630 --> 05:14:44.732
LOWERS THE THRESHOLD -- THAT WAS

05:14:44.799 --> 05:14:46.601
REQUIRED BY THE STEP TO BE ABLE

05:14:46.667 --> 05:14:47.535
TO ATTRACT THOSE COMPANIES.

05:14:47.602 --> 05:14:48.703
AND IT'S A VERY FUNCTIONAL

05:14:48.769 --> 05:14:52.540
PROGRAM AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE IT.

05:14:52.607 --> 05:14:54.508
ONE OF THE THE REASONS THAT THAT

05:14:54.575 --> 05:14:56.577
IT'S BECOME SO COMPETITIVE -- IN

05:14:56.644 --> 05:14:57.845
THE IN THE MARKETPLACE ROUTE THE

05:14:57.912 --> 05:14:58.546
COUNTRY.

05:14:58.613 --> 05:14:59.680
AS THAT ARE SURROUNDING STATES

05:14:59.747 --> 05:15:01.682
ROUGHING VERY LARGE INCENTIVES

05:15:01.749 --> 05:15:02.550
TO THESE COMPANIES.

05:15:02.617 --> 05:15:04.552
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ONE MAKE

05:15:04.619 --> 05:15:05.553
SURE THAT WE CREATE?

05:15:05.620 --> 05:15:07.855
A GOOD PLACE FOR COMPANIES THAT

05:15:07.922 --> 05:15:09.023
ARE GROWING WITHIN THE STATE OF

05:15:09.090 --> 05:15:11.525
CALIFORNIA. TO EXPAND INTO AND

05:15:11.592 --> 05:15:12.827
FOR US TO RETAIN THOSE COMPANIES

05:15:12.893 --> 05:15:13.561
HERE.

05:15:13.628 --> 05:15:14.629
THE REASON THAT WE CHOOSE THOSE

05:15:14.695 --> 05:15:16.497
INDUSTRY CLUSTERS OF THREE THAT

05:15:16.564 --> 05:15:17.632

WHERE WE WE LEAD THE NATION AND

05:15:18.899 --> 05:15:19.533
INNOVATION.

05:15:19.600 --> 05:15:21.469
