ALRIGHT. MY NAME IS DAVID CHIU ON THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. OUT OF OUR STATE CAPITOL I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU ON FRIDAY MARCH THE NINTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. TO TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON ADDRESSING THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES. AND CONCERNING CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. WHENEVER JUST FIRST SAY THAT I IT'S GREAT FOR ME TO BE HERE AND SAMBAR MEDINA I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOMEZ REYES FOR INVITING US TO HER DISTRICT. DISCUSS THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I UNDERSTAND WE ARE ONE BLOCK WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT AND A BLOCK AWAY FROM. VICE CHAIR COMMITTEES DISTRICT. AND I WANT TO THANK AND WELCOME OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER STEINORTH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. ALSO TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE STAFF OF THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE AND IN PARTICULAR JOSH CANDELARIA FOR pI'M GONNA MAKE  FEW YET GIVEN UP FOR THEM. I'M GOING TO MAKE A FEWOPENING REMARKS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR A FEW REMARKS AND THEN WE HAVE A SERIES OF PANELS. ARTS REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HOUSING CRISIS LOOKS LIKE HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE HERE IN SAMBOR MEDINA. LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING THAT IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. FROM THE SAN DIEGO BORDER UP TO THE OREGON BORDER FROM THE COAST ALL THE WAY INLAND. WE'RE ALL SEEN THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS LOOKED. DIFFERENTLY DOT IN DIFFERENT CORNERS OF THE STATE. I REPRESENT SAN FRANCISCO MY CITY HAS THE HIGHEST RENTS AND HOME PRICES IN THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS LOOKS LIKE I KNOW BEARS SOME SIMILARITY TO WHAT WE MAY BE EXPERIENCING HERE. UP THERE PROBABLY SOME CRITICAL DIFFERENCES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS TO UNDERSTAND. LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN REALLY MODERN HISTORY. I'M VERY PROUD THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A HISTORIC PACKAGE OF FIFTEEN BILLS. YOU BEGIN TO ADDRESS A HOUSING CRISIS. ARE ON THE FUNDING SIDE WE ESTABLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME A PERMANENT SOURCE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING. WE HAVE PLACED ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT THIS YEAR A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND FOR MORE INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AROUND THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF MEASURES THAT HOLD CITIES AND COUNTIES MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO BUILD HOUSING. AS WELL AS TO STREAMLINE THE HOUSING CREATION PROCESS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW LONG THAT COULD TAKE. BUT AS I AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUE SAID LAST YEAR. THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE THUS FAR I THINK IS THE FIRST AND GOOD STEP. WE MIGHT SAY AS A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE PROBLEM BUT AS ANYONE KNOWS A DOWN PAYMENT REPRESENT SOLVING TWENTY PERCENT YOUR PROBLEM. WE GOT EIGHTY PERCENT TO GO. WE ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST RENTS THE HEIST HOME PRICES WERE SEEN. A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS ALL OVER THE STATE RACINE CONVICTION AND ATTENDED CRISES ALL OVER THE STATE. AYE AND WE GOT WORK TO DO AND SO OF LAST YEAR WE STARTED A SERIES OF HEARINGS AROUND CALIFORNIA WE DID PROBABLY ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN LAST YEAR. THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING OF THIS TYPE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AT A MORE LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT DOES THE HOUSING CRISIS LOOK LIKE WHAT DOES THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS LOOK LIKE AND AGAIN I WANT TO REALLY THANK ELOISE? NOT JUST FOR BEING SUCH A HOUSING CHAMPION I HERE AND IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT FOR. INVITING US AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS FOR MANY MONTHS AND I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO. CHO INSIDER SCHEDULES TO JOIN SO HOT SO WITH THAT. AGAIN REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE LOOK FOR TO HEARING FROM OTHER WITNESSES AND NOW I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY WOMAN GOMEZ RESTS. GIVE IT UP FOR HER. I DO WANT TO THANK. CHAIR OF THE. HOUSING. ME TOO DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. MY MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. SPEND AN ABSOLUTE CHAMPION WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING.

THAT WE FACE HERE IN SAN BERNARDINO BUT ALSO SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER AS A COUNTY AND IS INDIVIDUAL. A DEVELOPER'S TECH TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN OUR DISTRICT. IT'S A. I DO WANT YOU TO THE HOPE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU WAS ELECT FIRST ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS INDICATED HE REPRESENTS SAN FRANCISCO. BEFORE THAT HE WAS THE. WHAT POSITION DID YOU HAVE WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS? APPARENTLY A HEADED UP THAT BOARD THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT ME.

ASK MY VICE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE SOMEONE WHO I THINK MANY YOU KNOW WELL. WHO HAILS FROM THIS REGION? YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT.

IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DAVID M. ALLUDED TO HE AND I HAVING LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS AND IT'S IT'S INTERESTING HIS PERSPECTIVE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IS IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE INSANITY NOW AND IT'S. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT CALIFORNIA'S IT VERY LARGE AND DIVERSE STATE AND HOUSING NEEDS WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING LEGISLATION IN SACRAMENTO.

PREVIOUS AERO WHEN REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE ALIVE AND WELL CITIES DID A LOT OF NEW OF REMOVING BLIGHT AND AND REYES SEEING THE MANY. OF AND ON OUTDATED NEIGHBORHOOD AND BEING ABLE TO THEN TO REBUILD MANY MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE. TODAY. WE ARE LOOKING AT MANY OF THESE TYPE OF HOPEFULLY FUNDED PROJECTS TO BE ABLE TO ENABLE THIS TYPE OF REVITALIZATION IN REDEVELOPMENT TO TAKE PLACE. AND WITH THAT SAID WE KNOW IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THIS COUNTY HAVE BE. THE NEW DEVELOPMENT FRONTIERS. WE ARE DETERMINED TO BE ABLE TO BE A GOOD PARTNER IN A GOOD NEIGHBOR TO OUR TWENTY FOUR CITIES THAT THEY MAY LOOK UPON WHAT WE ARE DEVELOPING AND BUILDING. JUST ACROSS THEIR CITY LIMITS BUT WITHIN THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AS SOMETHING THAT IS POSSIBLE SOMETHING THAT IS ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE ANNEXATION.

TO CREATE ADDITIONAL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE WORK DILIGENTLY TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR SUB POPULATIONS OF THE OVER ALL MAKEUP OF HOMELESSNESS. IN THOSE SUB SUB POPULATIONS ARE OUR YOUTH ARE VETERANS ARE FAMILIES. CHRONIC HOMELESS THE ONE IN FOR WHICH IS ONE ONE MILLION EVERY FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THE PLIGHT BUT THEY FACE AS UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN AND ALSO OUR SENIOR SUBPOPULATION. BY ENGAGING WITH PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO ADDRESS ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS TO HOUSING. WE PROMOTE AND AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED THE HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNTS. THE DATE FROM THE DATA FROM WHICH THE HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNTS JUSTIFY OUR NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO CALM. AND BETWEEN THE YEARS TWENTY ó SEVEN AND TWENTY SIX TEAM WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. AND. AND ALSO. UP BY APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY PERCENT HOWEVER WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND IS I GET INTO OUR CHALLENGES. THAT WE ARE. NEIGHBORS TO ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY WAS WE KNOW IS IS OUR LARGEST COUNTY AND. AND WE ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THEIR HOMELESS A BETTER. TRANSITIONAL MIGRATION ALSO THERE IS A HIGHER COST OF LIVING IN OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES AND WE ARE EXTREMELY ASSESSABLE. WE ARE EXTREMELY LARGE WE ARE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SQUARE MILES AND OUR CHALLENGES ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER. YOU WOULD THINK WHY WITH THE WEATHER BE SUCH A CHALLENGE WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO COME AND SPEND THEIR TOURISM DOLLARS TO COME HERE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE HOMELESS LOVE OUR WEATHER TO. AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PLACES TO BE ABLE TO CALL HOME. WE HAVE WE HAVE. A HIGH. DENSITY. HOUSING NEED. WE HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE THROUGH PLANTED GROWTH THROUGH ADDRESSING AND IN BRINGING OUR TWENTY FOUR CITIES ON BOARD WITH YOUR GUIDANCE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN WHICH WE CAN UNITE WITH ONE UNITED GOAL. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN NORTHERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY OR IN SOUTHERN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. IT ULTIMATELY IMPACTS ALL OF THE OTHER COUNTIES AROUND US NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTIES IMPACTS COSTS SO BEING ABLE TO LIFT EITHER THROUGH THE RAIN ON NUMBERS OR LOOK AT HOW DO WE BALANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND HIGH AND LOW DENSITY TYPE OF OF DEVELOPMENTS IS KEY. IN CLOSING I WOULD SAY. THAT. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH A NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM THE S. B. TO WERE OTHER POLICIES THAT WERE ADOPTED AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S HOUSING PACKAGE WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO ASSIST THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND HERE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WE DO MORE THAN BUILD HOUSING. WE BUILD A WHOLE COMMUNITIES WE HOUSE OUR HOMELESS WITH PARTNERS LIKE THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

I WOULD GO TO APARTMENTS AND THEY'D SAY WELL IT'S A WILL I WANT TO GET ON THE WITNESS IN. OF NO BIG FACTOR IS THE SET OF WITNESSES CLUBS. YOU KNOW MAYBE FIVE YEARS LONG WAY EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO GET ON THE WAITING LIST. IT WASN'T CLOSE BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MANY PEOPLE ON THERE YOU CAN GET ON THE. SO WHILE YOU'RE WAITING ON THIS WAITING LIST. TING YOU TO LIVE OUT OF YOUR HOME TO CONTINUE TO BE HOMELESS SEVEN THE COR YEAH. YEAH IT'S A IT'S. IT'S HORRIBLE BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO IN ORDER TO. LIVE IN THE WORLD AND IT'S IT'S A BE OF MONKS EVERYBODY ELSE AND TRY TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE. A FEELING LIKE AN OUTSIDER BECAUSE YOU BE ME. TO FILL THAT WAY BECAUSE. GOOD. IT IT BECOMES A WHOLE. THE HOMELESS HAVE THEIR OLD LIKE. HUMANITARIAN KNOW THIS BLAME U. WE COME AS A GROUP. YOU IDENTIFY WITH ONE ANOTHER SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN PART OF A GROWING CITY HIM A RAISE BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST SO DISRESPECT. IT'S REALLY ABOUT RESPECT WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. WE WANT TO BE RESPECTED. WE ALL WENT HOME TO LIVE IN WILL ONE JUST QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT WHEN YOU BECOME A HOMES YOU KNOW TREATED WITH THAT.

WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO BE CHANGED IN THE PROCESS? TWO ALLOWS SOMEONE WHO'S GONE THROUGH WHICH YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH. TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SOONER. OR AND TO TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND FINALLY GET THE HOUSING. WHAT VERY KNOWN AS WHEN I WAS GOING TO MY PREDICAMENT HOME? I RECALL LAW THAT LIKE THE TWO OF ONE AGENCIES WHICH IS SUPPORT SHOULD BE IN ALL THE RESOURCES AND THEY LEAD YOU TO THE NEXT ALL THESE NUMBERS AND. NOT SEEN IT SO NOT HELPFUL. WHAT IS SO FLOWS REALLY CALL THOSE NUMBERS IT SO WELL THAT? THAT PRO GROWTH PROGRAM IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE FUNDS. WHAT WOULD HAVE LESS WELL SUITED WITH? I'M NOT. YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT NOT ON THE CABINET I DON'T MAKE THE DECISIONS YOU KNOW ON. WHAT IS THE BE ALLIGATOR WOULD FUNDS GO WEARING HERE AND THERE AND ALL THAT? THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD SO MONIES TO HOLD ME. WE DON'T THE PROGRAM DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE OR WE DON'T HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AND PREDICT THE FIRST SENIOR SOMEBODY MY AGE IS REALLY DIFFICULT. BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY RAISE OUR KIDS WE'VE ALREADY. LIVE THEIR LIFE PRETTY MUCH DURING THAT MIDDLE AGE GROUP THERE REALLY IS NOT A PROGRAM OUT THERE. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS GEARED TOWARDS THE MALL WITH THE CHILDREN. WHY RAISE MY KIDS SO I ALSO FELT LIKE WELL OKAY NOW BEING PENALIZED BECAUSE I RAISE MY KIDS IN? THE ROLLING COLLEGE. MONA MALEK BICU WHAT DOES POLLS DO THERE BUT NOW I NEED HOPE. IN THE MEAN TO YOU THE OTHER BE DOING DRUGS. OR DRINKING OR BE IT A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE TIGHT TO. WHERE YOU HAD TO HAVE SUB DUB ISSUES WELL I'M CHRISTIAN? I NEVER SMOKED NEVER DRANK IT NEVER DID DRUGS SO THAT'S NEVER BEEN A PART IN MY LIFE AND THAT WAS AN ALLIANCE THE OLD BUT YEAH I DO DO EXACTLY. JUST TO GET IN PROGRAM. SO THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PROGRAMS OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE. AND SPECIFICALLY HOUSING YES AND NOW DID YOU FIND TEMPORARY HOUSING AT THE BEGINNING. NO. EVEN THOUGH AND THAT'S WHAT IT FELLOW TO EVEN WITH THE SHELTERS. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHEN YOU GO TO A SHELTER. HOW YOU AT THE SITE NOW BUT BE THERE UNDERSERVED? YOU CAN'T JUST WALK ATME THEY OWE. KILLER JUST STAY HERE IT DOES WORK LIKE THAT. YOU NOTICE THEM IN LINE. AND YOU BETTER BE IN LINE EARLY ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN GET IN THE SHELTER. AND THEY WANT YOU GET IN THERE. HOME A LOT OF MIDDLE OF THE STATE EITHER THERE'S NO ONE. THERE IS NO POLICE THERE IS NOBODY THERE TO PROTECT SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF THEFT. MY GOD I HOPE AND PRAY THAT YOU HAD A WAKE UP RATE TOUR. BE AN ABUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOBODY THERE TO PROTECT YOU. SCARY. FOR FOR. I THANK YOU FOR ALL THE INFORMATION. PROVIDER GONZALEZ I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN. GREATER EFFORT AT COUNTY TO COUNTY RELATIONSHIPS. COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE RELATIONSHIPS AS PARTNERSHIPS. WITH OTHER COUNTIES WHETHER IT'S RIVERSIDE YOU TALKED ABOUT LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE. PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEM AS WELL. NOT PARTICULARLY. BECAUSE OF OUR CLOSE PROXIMITY AND SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHICS AND IDENTITY AND ALSO BEING KNOWN AS THE INLAND EMPIRE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS TRULY. OUR BEST OF PARTNERED. PARTNER AND OUR BEST ALLY. AND I HOPE THAT THEY LOOK UPON SAN BERNADINO COUNTY IN THE SAME LIGHT. AND BECAUSE WE ALSO. AND DO A UP BY COUNTY OF A BOARD REPRESENTATION ON THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN. WELL WE ALSO FIND ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AYE AND AND THERE IN LIES ANOTHER. STEP ANOTHER LAYER OF WORKING TO DRESSING ARE HOMELESS ISSUES AND OUR HOMELESS OF THROUGH A VERY NEW AND INNOVATIVE. PLAN OF BRINGING AYE E. H. P. ONBOARDING I'M SURE YOU WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT ULTIMATELY PARTNERING WITH OTHER COUNTIES OTHER THAN RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS NOT HAPPENED. OF. IRONICALLY HERE THREE WEEKS AGO TODAY I. AYE CALLED SUPERVISOR A TODD SPITZER FROM ORANGE COUNTY AYE THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF ADDRESSING THEIR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT. AYE IT ALONG THE SANTA RIVER. AND. I SPOKE TO HIM AND I ASKED HIM IF IN FACT THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MEET INTO BEGAN TO DISCUSS ON A REGIONAL. BASIS WITH A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO IDENTIFY OUR CHALLENGES AND WORK TOGETHER TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS VERY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR ONE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA TO THE OTHER AGAIN ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE THE HIGH DESERT. WE HAVE THE LOWER DESERT WE HAVE THE INLAND VALLEY AND AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SETS OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT CRY TO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE SAME PROBLEM. BUT YES WE ARE WE WORK CLOSELY A IN IN MANY RESPECTS WITH RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND WE COULD DEFINITELY USE A LOT OF HELPING ENCOURAGING OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. COME TOGETHER AND PERHAPS WE CAN FORM A REGIONAL COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS THERE WOULD ADDRESS ANA ON ON ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND PERHAPS WE COULD EVEN COME TOGETHER AND APPLY FOR FUNDING. IN ARENAS THAT COULD IMPACT ALL MULTIPLE OF OUR REGIONS OR WHERE WE COME TOGETHER SUCH AS IN PRATO DAM WHERE WE HAVE ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY COMING TOGETHER. SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE. I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU OUR FIRST PANELIST THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOARD FOR TAKING THIS TIME. WOULD BE SUPERVISOR HAD ONE QUESTION FOR YOU I APOLOGIZE OF YOU REVEREND JUST REDEVELOPMENT EARLIER AND I HAVE A BILL. AND I'M WORKING WITH THE WORKING GROUP OF OF LEGISLATORS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT REDEVELOPMENT TO PUT NO COULD LOOK LIKE. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNEW WHAT THE OBJECTIVE THAT WAS WHEN IT WAS ELIMINATED WITH THE GREAT RECESSION BUT I'M CURIOUS FROM YOUR STANDPOINT. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE FROM A NEW VERSION OF REDEVELOPMENT WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL HERE AND SEVERED INDIA? CHAIRMAN CHU I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS AN HONOR TO HEAR OB THE PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE RELATIVE TO ADDRESSING OF THE WORK OUR NEED FOR REDEVELOPMENT THROUGH YOUR BILL. LET ME SAY TO YOU THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PASSED. OVERSIGHT MISTAKES AND WHAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DEMISE THE DISSOLUTION OF THE RDAS. NOT BE REPEATED IN THE FORM OF CLOSE AUDITS. DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING REGULAR REPORTS ON WHAT IS BEING DONE WITH THE FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR SUCH REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY PROJECTS. THAT THAT THERE BE THAT THERE BE CONSEQUENCES FOR VIOLATIONS WERE TRANSGRESSIONS WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROPER USE OF THOSE FUNDS IN THAT IN THAT MANNER IT WOULD INSURE THAT THE AGENCIES THE CITY'S. HOWEVER THIS ENDS UP. COMING INTO A DELIVERY FORM THE COUNTY I HOPE WILL BE INCLUDED THAT WE ARE ABLE TO INSULATE AND PROTECT THOSE AGENCIES THAT IN FACT ADHERE TO THE RULES AND DON'T MISS BAND. OR DO ANY KIND OF FRAUD THAT WOULD INVOLVE JEOPARDIZING THOSE FUNDS THAT THEN WOULD INSURE THAT THOSE DESIGNATED THEM ALLOCATED ALLOCATION OF FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR WHAT. IS THE ACTUALLY THE AND TAPPED. SOUNDS LIKE SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT WITH THEIR PERSPECTIVE. I'LL JUST SAY AS A AS A CLOSING COMMENT. FOR FOLKS WHO KNEW THAT REDEVELOPMENT WAS INITIALLY DESIGNED AS A PROGRAM TO ADDRESS BLIGHT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF DEFINITION OF WHAT. BLIGHT MENTOR WHAT WOULD MEAN TO ADDRESS POLITE AND SO MONIES ARE SPENT ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN ALSO SPENT ON GOLF COURSES AND STRIP MALLS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WOULDN'T SEEM AS CENTRAL TO THAT GOAL. WE ARE CONTEMPLATING FOCUSING ANY REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS ON HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEFINED AS PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHAT YOU NEED FOR ROADS OR PIPES OTHER THINGS SEWER SYSTEMS. BUT BUT CERTAINLY I THINK YOUR PERSPECTIVE HOW TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY IS ONE. ABOUT. CLOSELY SO AGAIN THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PERSONAL. YOU'RE MOST WELL UP WELCOME AND I TELL YOU YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BILL ANYTHING I CAN DO ANY DEMOGRAPHICS ANY ANY INFORMATION DATA YOU NEED I WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. I THINK IT IS AWESOME MANY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE A BROAD PERSPECTIVE IN LOOKING TO THE FUTURE IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO S. C.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALSO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US AT YOUR HOUSE TODAY THANK YOU. TO TO CONDUCT THIS MEETING. YEAH SO WHAT WITH THAT ONE RETURN IT TO US MISS WINTERS WE'VE US EACH OF THE PANELISTS TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO. DESCRIBE THEIR CRISIS AS YOU SEE HERE IN SAN BERNARDINO ANY SUGGESTIONS THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US WORK ON. IN SACRAMENTO. YOU I AM AGAIN VIEWPOINT IS DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR KEEPING ABOUT WHEN AND HOW I THINK AGENCY. THAT ENCOMPASSES. CLICK GROUPS OF THE OFFICE ON THE SERVICES CAN DEPARTMENT HOUSING. AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY SAN BERNARDINO. AND I REALLY THINK DETERMINE REALLY DESCRIBED VERY CLEARLY IN THE OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING. WITHIN THE STATE AND M. AS. THE COST OF HOUSING GOES UP AS YOU HEARD FROM LISA. YOU KNOW THE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GET IMPACTED AYE MEN ARE ON THE BRINK OF GOING FROM BEING HOUSE TO HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW WAS VERY FAN AND EQUALLY THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE THE RENTAL PRICE AND HOUSING PRICES UP WHAT'S EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE EQUALLY AS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. I'M WITH IN THE WORLD AS WE GO IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND OTHER AREAS IN THE COUNTY. MY EXPERIENCE IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP REDEVELOPMENT MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF CITIES FOR A MAJORITY OF MY CAREER AND THE LAST PORTION. IS ONE I'VE WORKED FOR ACCOUNTING AND IT'S VERY. AND DIFFERENT AND COMPLEMENTARY AND WAYS THAT I'M GROUPS MAY OR MAY NOT REALIZED AND SO THE FIRST BY THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS HOW DO YOU DEVELOP HOUSING IN THE POST REDEVELOPMENT WORLD. IN THE WORLD OF REDEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY IN THIS COUNTY THE FUNDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE YEARS FOR BRICKS AND MORTAR AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THINGS KIND OF GOT DIVERGED OFFICE BUILDING BRICKS AND MORTAR AND SUSTAINABLE. INVESTMENTS THAT HELP THE COMMUNITY AND THE LONG TERM. AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE A NUMBER OF THE TOP. THAT WE. TAX INCREMENT GENERATORS WERE ACTUALLY LOCATED IN MANY CITIES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND SO WHEN REDEVELOPMENT WENT AWAY. PARTICULAR ON THE WORLD OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT WAS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. A SIGNIFICANT OUR RESOURCES EQUALLY ONE OUT OF THE INLAND EMPIRE SO WHAT DO YOU DO POST REDEVELOPMENT. AND THEN TO ME IN ANYTHING THAT WHERE YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT KIND OF. STRUCTURAL PARADIGM SHIFT OF OPERATIONS. YOU GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF GRIEF BUT THEY'RE EQUALLY YOU YOU DON'T GIVE OUT. IN OUR IN THIS BUSINESS FOR THE STANDPOINT OF CHAFF BEING FOR THOSE WHO NEED HOUSING. INTO WHETHER IT'S ARE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES ARE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE HOMELESS POPULATIONS AND YOU DON'T GIVE UP YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU WORK SMARTER AND HARDER AND. MAKE THAT DOLLAR GO FURTHER WEST A FURTHER WIDER AND DEEPER AND HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH MORE OBJECTIVES AND PART OF WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT. ARE SOME UNEXPECTED RESOURCES YOU DON'T LEVERAGING OF TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL RESOURCES AND I THINK. IN DECEMBER NINETEEN ARE COUNTIES EFFORTS THERE'S BEEN A LOT. OF DIALOGUE AND COLLABORATIONS OF HOW DO WE FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITIES IF WE ALL HAVE. IN THEIR POCKETS OF FUNDS BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO UNDERWRITE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE ALL OF THOSE TOGETHER. AND TRY TO CAPTURE. BOTH TAX EQUITY DOLLARS THROUGH BLOCK GRANTS AND TAX CREDITS TO WITH OUR CITY PARTNERS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT ALSO REQUIRES FROM THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP AS WE HONOR COMING FROM CITIES THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CITY'S WHO WANT TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WE'RE GOING TO CHAMPION. HELPING FIGHT SITES GETTING THROUGH ENTITLEMENT PROCESSES HELPING WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE OTHER PART WHICH I THINK FROM A AND IT AND IT SHOULDN'T BE AN UNEXPECTED PARTNERSHIP BUT MANY TIMES. HAVING WORKED IN CITIES IN THREE COUNTIES NOW. M. MANY TIMES THE COUNTY YOU. AND THE CITIES HAVE VERY PARTICULAR THE STAFF AT THE LOWER STAFF LEVELS DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER DOES AND THE COUNTIES HELP A LOT OF THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS. PARTICULARLY I'M FOR THOSE WERE LOW INCOME AND HOMELESS ON SERVICES. AND THE CONNECTIONS BUT A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS LIVE IN THE CITIES AND OR THEY MAY LIVE IN COUNTY ON A CORPORATE IT BUT HOW DO WE CONNECT THOSE RESOURCES TOGETHER. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BRICKS AND MORTARS IT'S ABOUT THE ABILITY AND THE LONGEVITY OF THAT PERSON TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S CONNECTING THOSE UNEXPECTED PARTNERSHIPS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE LEARNINGS AS WE'VE GONE IN THE POST REDEVELOPMENT WORLD. BUT IF YOU DO BRING ON A REDEVELOPMENT TWO POINT NO BUT I THINK ONE OF THIS EXPERIENCE STATUS SABATINO IS HOW DO YOU LEVERAGE THAT KIND OF MORE STATE WIDE. IN THAT INTERCONNECTED WITTY. AND M. FROM OUR STANDPOINT IN SAMBOR MEDINA COUNTY BACK IN HOME SAFE TWENTY TWELVE REMEMBER CORRECTLY. ONE OF THE THINGS ARE ARE FROM ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS C. E. O. SAID AS AS YOU INVEST ITS TO WHAT AND. WHERE WE KIND TRYING TO GO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WERE NOT JUST GRABBING MONEY AND SPENDING IT IN ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS HOW DO WE SPEND IT THAT SHOULD BE WHAT YOU DO? BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE OBJECTIVE WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE FOR TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE IS IT JUST SPENDING FUNDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS. AND SO IT REALLY GOT INTO THE CREATION OF A COUNTY WIDE VISION. AND THAT REALLY DEFINES WHAT HAS OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY POINT B. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. INTO WHAT AND I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICES WERE WE DO WORK WITH. THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE CITIES AND TRYING TO HAVE. CONNECTIVITY ON MARKET RATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND HOW TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES BECKETT HELP FACILITATE HOUSING AND AN EQUALLY. EDUCATION IS CRUCIAL FOR SOCIAL ECONOMIC EQUITIES WITH IN PARTICULAR CHILDREN AS THEY GROW AND GIVING THEM CHOICES AND EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE KEYS. WE ALSO FOR MARC COUNTY STANDPOINT IS ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD WHAT DO WE DO TO DIVERSIFY OUR INCOME INVENTORY. AND OUR SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS AND I I REALLY HAVE TO THANK THE STATE IN IN KIND OF A DIALOGUE THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING BECAUSE WE WERE JUST TALKING WITH. ONE OF OUR FOLKS ABOUT. A LOT OF THE WORLD OF THE STATE AND HOUSING THE HOUSING AGENCIES WHO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE FOCUSED ON THAT POPULATION A LOT OF THE CONNECTED BEAUTY AS IT RELATED TO FROM SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ARE HOMELESSNESS. REALLY CAME OUT OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT ON ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE ANSWER STARTING TO BRING THE DIALOGUE TOGETHER POWER YOU CONNECT THOSE TOGETHER. AND AS THE STRUGGLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING JUST HOUSING IN GENERAL. THE LOWER SOCIAL ECONOMIC PORTION OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION AS THOSE WHOSE MOST CHALLENGED. BECAUSE THEY EVEN HAVE A HARDER ABILITY AS YOU HEARD FROM THE CIVIC GET INTO HOUSING AND TO MANEUVER THROUGH THAT PROCESS. SO I WANTED TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN RELATIONSHIP AGAIN TO PARTNERSHIPS ARTICLE PARTNERSHIPS IN PARTNERSHIPS AND IF YOU'RE DOING HOUSING RIGHT AND YOU'RE DOING WHAT USED TO BE REDEVELOPMENT RIGHT YOU'RE NOT JUST CREATING. HOUSING REVITALIZING A COMMUNITY YOUR CRAVINGS AND ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT. AND A SOCIAL ECONOMIC EVENT IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE AND THE COMMUNITY IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT'S WHAT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR EQUALLY WHEN THEY ARE INVESTING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND IN THE CITY OF VICTORVILLE ACTUALLY IN THE HOMELESS WORLD TO ME THIS WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW DO YOU PARTNER BETWEEN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY THE COUNTY AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. BEING THE CITY OF VICTORVILLE WHO REALIZE THEY HAD A HOMELESS POPULATION AND AN IMPACT. M. RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND REACHING OUT TO THE COUNTY AND ASKING YOU KNOW WE REALIZE THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME HOUSING THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND THEY HELP THEM IN THE LEADERSHIP OF WHAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY DOES IDENTIFY SITES FOUND A MOTEL THAT THEY FELT WAS APPROPRIATE THAT MOTEL HAD ISSUES FROM. CODE ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S MAKING THAT DOLLAR DO MORE. THAN JUST PROVIDE HOUSING OR JUST BUILDING A STREETER CHEST IN A BUILDING A PARK. AND THEN. PARTNERING BOTH FINANCIALLY AND WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTY FOR ULTIMATELY DOING A MOTEL CONVERSION AND CREATING PERM SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH THEN LINKS EQUALLY. TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. EITHER THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IF YOU ARE SERIOUS THE HOUSING FUNDS IN RELATIONSHIP TO AND PROVIDING SERVICES SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY KIND OF READING THE LINKAGES. OF THE LOCAL LEVEL ROSE TO THE COUNTY TO THE SERVICES TO OUR PARTNERS IN PROVIDERS. TO ADDRESS AND THE RESIDENTS AND IT REALLY GETS INTO THAT INTEGRATED APPROACH. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE RESOURCES BUT AND THEY ALL HAVE A GREAT PURPOSE. AND MANY TIMES THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING DOWN TO IT EQUALLY MORE IMPORTANT OF HOW DO YOU APPLYING THEM TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVE. AND EQUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH IS SECURE COMPETITIVE FUNDING FOR OUR REGION. HEAT YOU MENTIONED JOSH CANDELARIA OUR BOARD IS VERY ACTIVE AND YOU HAVE SEEN ASKS MANY TIMES IN THE OFFICES ABOUT LOOKING AT BILLS LOOKING AT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. LOOKING AT TRYING OF HOW DO WE% CAPTURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE IF BILLS ARE GOING FORWARD. HOW DO WE ASSURE THERE'S EQUITY DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL REVENUES I'M FOR OUR REGION AND AND WHAT IT REALLY GETS TO AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT JOSH HAD ALWAYS IDENTIFIED? IS. IS THAT IT ISN'T SO MUCH THE BILL THE BILL OBVIOUSLY IS FEAR OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT TO GETTING THE MECHANISM IN PLACE. IT IS THEM BOTH LOCAL STATE AGENCIES WHO WRITES WRITES THE REGULAR ACTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. AND THAT IS CRUCIAL IN RELATIONSHIP TO BEING INVOLVED AT THAT LEVEL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE STATE BECAUSE. WHETHER ITS STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. AS WE HAD DIALOGUE WITH THEM ABOUT CHANGING CAP AND TRADE REGULATIONS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THEY HAD DENSITIES THAT WAS ON ECONOMICALLY UNVIABLE FOR OUR COUNTY AT THE DENSITIES. OR TALKING WITH EIGHT CD WHO'S NOW WRITING REGULATIONS ON S. B. TWO. IS FOUND REACHING OUT AND TALKING WITH US AND AND HOPEFULLY AND RELATIONSHIPS ABOUT. HAVING SOME IMPACT ON ON HOW THOSE REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN AND IMPLEMENTED SO THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. INVESTMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND AGAIN FOR OUR COUNTY WE WILL FIGHT HARD AND TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE FUNDS FOR OUR REGION. BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT PARTNERS AND WE HAVE LIKE EVERYWHERE THERE'S MORE DEMAND THAN THERE IS SUPPLY. AND SO THE COOPERATION BOTH AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT. AND THEN I'M BRIEFLY GOING TO GO THROUGH WHAT SUPERVISOR. GONZALEZ MENTIONED ANTS TO GIVE YOU A HIGHLIGHT OF. OF AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BLOOMINGTON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD DIRECTED THE CBO ABOUT LOOKING AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTY ON A CORPORATE IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COUNTY ANA COOPERATED AND WHY WE LOOKED AT THAT IS. UNLIKE CITIES HAVING COME FROM CITIES. NADA UNDERSTANDING THE BEAUTY OF WHILE THERE'S A SEWER AND THERE'S WATER AND THERE'S A SIDEWALK AND THERE'S A STORM DRAIN AND I'M GONNA FIND A SITE TO INFILL. AND COMMIT TO. IT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT IN THE COUNTY INCORPORATED YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS THAT THE COST OF DOING AFFORDABLE. HOUSING OR DOING INVESTMENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COUNTY INCORPORATED POCKETS IS EVEN MORE OF AN ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS. WE FOUND THAT. THE BOARD THROUGH THE CHAMPIONING AB BY SUPERVISOR GONZALEZ ACTUALLY FUNDED A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR THE BALLOT CORRIDOR LOOMING TENNIS TALKED. BETWEEN THE CITY OF RIALTO IN THE CITY OF FONTANA. AND THE PROJECT. IS PART ON VALLEY CORRIDOR AND TYPICALLY AS YOU SAW ON THE WORLD OF REDEVELOPMENT YOU USE PUBLIC FACILITIES AND HOUSING AS ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION TOOL FOR AREAS AND THAT'S HOW. YOU SHOULD BE INVESTING FUNDS THIS IDENTIFIES THE MAP. WHERE THE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED WE'RE HOPING EQUALLY TO RELOCATE A PARK AS PART OF A THIRD PHASE? THIS IS A MULTI GENERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ALMOST TWO HUNDRED UNITS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND ACTUALLY THE INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT HOUSING. UNITS WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT WE HAD THE LIBRARY AND THERE WAS OVER SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT PRETTIES TWO PHASES SUMMER OF WORKING ON THE THIRD PHASE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK EQUALLY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS PARTNERSHIPS WITH. THE WITH THE NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERS LIKE THE SCHOOL. BECAUSE WE'VE STARTED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE LIBRARY. AND WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE THEIR RESOURCES ON BOOK BUYS AN EDUCATION AND EVENTUALLY USING THE COMPUTER LEARNING CENTER. THAT GAVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE GRAPHIC WAS THAT THE PICTURE OF WHAT THE LIBRARY WILL BE INTEGRATED HOUSING ABOVE IT HELPED US FROM THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROJECT. AND THIS GIVES YOU ARE ALWAYS LIKE ON OUR DEVELOPERS PROVIDE NICE PICTURES OF AMENITIES BUT TO ME WHAT IT REALLY GETS IS ABOUT KIDS. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY LEFT THERE YOU MET LISA WHO IS ONE OF THE RESIDENTS AGAIN AT THE NEXT GENERATION OF SENIOR AND HOUSING? AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND IT IS A COMMUNITY CELEBRATION. ENDS. AND I AND I I DO YOU KNOW AND AGAIN I'M WORKING IN A COUNTY IT REQUIRES YOU TO WORK WITH SOME ANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND THE REQUIRED US TO PARTNER NOT THROUGH WITH LAUGHED CHO AND THE CITY OF RIALTO AND THE COUNTY AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES. SO WITH FACTS AND THE ONE THING I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IN RELATIONSHIP TO BLOOMINGTON FOR FUTURE POLICY. IS. SOMETHING IN TALKING WITH THE CITY ARE TERRIBLY FOR THE MEETING IS THERE ARE OR. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH EIGHT CD ANTI CAC. AND IT'S TALKING ABOUT TARGETING INTO HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS AND HIGH AWKWARD TRYING TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING. INTO I'M HIGHER SOCIAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER SCHOOLS AND BETTER AMENITIES. BUT THE CONCERN IS REALLY FINDING A BALANCE BECAUSE BLOOMINGTON MAY NOT. YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A HIGH ECONOMIC HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREA AND WHAT EQUALLY IS OF CONCERN IS PASS. IF THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE FOCUS OF HIGH OPPORTUNITIES THE ONE SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT STILL AVAILABLE FOR ECONOMIC REINVESTMENT AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING FROM A SOCIAL ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. YOU'VE JUST REDIRECTED INTO THE HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES AND BLOOMINGTON MAY NEVER HAPPEN BUILT IF THAT WAS THE EXISTING PHILOSOPHY AT THE STATE. SO THAT WAS THE ONE POLICY THING IN RELATIONSHIP TO BLOOMINGTON THAT I WANTED TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE WE'VE BEEN JOINED. BY OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES SUTTER COUNTY LABOR. WHO HAS BEEN A GREAT CHAMPION FOR HOUSING? AND TACKLING THESE ISSUES I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUE MISTER STEINORTH HAS A QUESTION FOR. MS POINTERS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES WITH REGARD TO SB TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S. A POSSIBLY SOME LOCAL CONSORTIUM ISSUES REGARDING THE COUNTY THAT THEY WERE HOPING TO ADDRESS DURING THE REGULATION PROCESS COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT. YES AND AND THANK YOU COME IN IN SP TWO IT HAS OBVIOUSLY THE FUNDS ARE DIRECTED TO GET TO THE LOCAL CITIES IN THE COUNTY AND IT'S BASED UPON. WHAT'S IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL THROUGH THE QUEEN ABOUT A BLOCK GRANT WHAT HAD USES FOR THE METRICS PERCY PPG IN ABOUT A BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATION. FOR ONE THING THE BILL IS UNCLEAR AND THAT THE H. CD STAFF. AS THERE HAS BEEN GREAT AND OBTAINING DIALOGUE IS WHAT ABOUT THE CONSORTIUM'S BECAUSE IN RELATIONSHIP TO OUR COUNTY. WE HAVE. BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR CITIES. AND THE COUNTY OF WHICH. ELEVEN CITIES GET DIRECT ENTITLEMENT AND THE REMAINING THIRTEEN INCLUDING THE COUNTY ARE PART OF THE COUNTY CONSORTIUM. IF CONSORTIUMIS NOT PART OF THE METRICS IN THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THEN ELEVEN OF OUR CITIES WILL GET A DIRECT ALLOCATION THE BEST BE TO. THE COUNTY WILL GOTTA A MODIFIED VERSION AND THEN THE REMAINING TWELVE CITIES WILL HAVE TO COMPETE AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL TO SECURE FUNDING FROM S. B. TO THE WAY THE METHODOLOGY AS. AND WE'VE HAD THIS DIALOGUE WITH EACH CD ROM. AND AND THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THEM AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY ARE. WEIGHING IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT ULTIMATELY THEIR REGULATION BUT SAY OBVIOUSLY FROM OUR COUNTY YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CONSORTIUM. AND THE WAY THE HEAD METRICS WORKS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE S. B. TWO ALLOCATION BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED BUT THEN WE HAVE. A VARIETY OF CITIES WHO THEN HAVE TO COMPETE AT THE STATE LEVEL VERSUS ENSURING THAT THE FUNDS ARE STAYING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN A MORE DISPERSED. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN WE GO TO OUR NEXT PRESENTATION OF MR UPON TELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I MAY HAVE THE CLICKER DINA. I IT'S HONORED TO BE BACK BEFORE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ARAFAT OR CALL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE COMMITTEE AT THE INVITATION OF THE VICE CHAIRMAN. SO THE REFRIGERATOR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY. I'M IN THE SPIRIT OF TIME I'M GOING TO ESSENTIALLY BLOW THROUGH. THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION I KIND OF GET TO THE MAIN POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH. BUT THE PROJECT THEY WERE USING AS A BACKDROP IS WORTHY OF NOTE FOR A COUPLE REASONS. ARROWHEAD GROVE IS THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE NINETEEN FORTY THREE ARAB PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT. I TURNED FIFTY TWO UNITS IN SAMBOR MEDINA. AND SO THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I HAD SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND AT THE TIME OF THE BEGINNING OF THE EFFORT TO REVITALIZE IT REDEVELOPMENT STILL EXISTED. DURING THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE ENTITLEMENTS REDEVELOPMENT WENT AWAY AND THE CITY IS HAMMER YOU KNOW ENTERED INTO BANKRUPTCY SO OTHER THAN THAT LITTLE CHALLENGES PROJECT HAS BEEN NO PROBLEM AT ALL. I'M AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS THE PROJECT IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL CORPS THE HOUSING AUTHORITY THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER TO BE PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP IN ORDER TO MOVE IT FORWARD. A COUPLE OF INTERESTING JUST FOOTNOTES ALONG THE WAY HAVING SAID WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT WE DID. WAS A FIVE ACRE OFFSITE PARCEL IN ORDER TO HELP WITH THE RELOCATION OF RESIDENTS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION ON THE PROPERTY. WE WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE A FIVE ACRE PARCEL IN FROM THE TIME WE GOT SITE CONTROL UNTIL THAT TIME THE PARCEL WAS FULLY ENTITLED INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS. WAS TIED THREE MONTHS NINETY DAYS. SO IT CAN BE DONE IN THE SERIOUS EVER YOU KNOW STOOD UP AND MADE IT HAPPEN IT'S ANY CITIES THAT SAY THEY CAN'T GET IT DONE IS JUST NOT TRUE NINETY DAYS FROM CONTROL TOLL FULL ENTITLEMENT INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL EIGHTEEN MONTHS UNTIL WE WERE FULLY OCCUPIED CONSTRUCTION COMPLETED. WE MOVED AYE WE HAVE NOW MOVED ON SITE WITH THE FIRST PHASE ON SITE. IN A COUPLE OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WERE FOLLOWING THROUGH IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS NOT JUST TO REPLACE THE HOUSING UNITS IS TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IS A PROJECT. AND SO A COUPLE OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT. ONCE AGAIN I JUST SKIPPING THROUGH MOST OF THE SLIDES SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE WERE ABLE TO DO AS PART OF THIS REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT. IS NUMBER ONE WE DID A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. BECAUSE THE CITY IS HAMMERED UNIT NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT AND OUR COMMITMENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS NOT JUST READ DEVELOPING THE SITE AND REPLACING THE HOUSING. BUT TRANSFORMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAMAEL COUNTY HAS BEEN DESIGNATED THE LEAST HEALTHY MAJOR METROPOLITAN COUNTY IN THE NATION. THE INTERSECTION OF BASELINE A WATERMAN IS THE LEAST HEALTHY INTERSECTION IN THE COUNTY SO WE'RE REDEVELOPING THE LEAST HEALTHY INTERSECTION IN THE ENTIRE NATION. AND THAT'S BASED ON RATIOS OF FAST FOOD VAPE STORES LIQUOR STORES MARIJUANA IT'S CENTERED CENTER AND POVERTY RATES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES INTO THAT CALCULATION. AND SO THIS PROJECT IN THE FUNDS THAT HAVE COME TO THIS PROJECT ARE NOT JUST GOING TO CREATE QUALITY HOUSING GREGORY ABLE TO REVITALIZE THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. JUST REAL QUICK AS WITH ALL OF OUR PROJECTS AND BY THE WAY I'M THAT PRESIDENCY OF NATIONAL COMMITTEE RENAISSANCE WHERE THE LARGEST NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT NINE THOUSAND UNITS WERE ALSO IN TEXAS AND ARKANSAS. AND WHERE A TYPICAL NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. AND SO WE USE EVERY TOOL THAT'S AVAILABLE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION WAS SIX PROJECTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAPPEN TO BE VERY BUSY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERY PROJECT IS GETTING TOUGHER NOTCHES FROM A FINANCING STANDPOINT BUT FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT. BUT AT LEAST THE MARGINS ARE GETTING THINNER. I HAVE A MAYES LISTENING TO ME THAT WAS ATTACHED. WHAT FOUR POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH? IN ORDER FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AS AN INDUSTRY AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS NOT JUST BE SITE SPECIFIC IN OUR ORIENTATION WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW WELL WE DO CAN BE CATALYTIC IN THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO THE MORE WE THINK ABOUT HOUSING AS A PART OF IN A CATTLE LAST FOR A CATALYST FOR THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE. THE SECOND IS WE CAN'T JUST FORGOTTEN FOCUS ON HOUSING AS A IN ISOLATION WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOUSING AS PART OF THE SYSTEM. AND THE MOST EASY TO EXACT TO TALK ABOUT IT WHAT I TESTIFIED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HEALTH AND HOUSING. AND HOW WOULD A CRITICAL SOCIAL DETERMINATE OF HEALTH HOUSING IS AS SILLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST WEEK I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AYE AGE PEOPLE LAST FORTIFIED YEARS. I'M GETTING HIGH E. H. P. TO LOOK AT HOUSING AND YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM THEM LATER TODAY. BUT ACROSS THE STATE OF WE THINK ABOUT THE UTILIZATION OF HEALTH DOLLARS THE RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT IS MASSIVE. IF WE HAVE ADEQUATE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE COUNTY LOS ANGELES PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT CREATED THERE ARE HOUSING AUTHORITY. THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING A NET POSITIVE CASH FLOW THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSE PERSON THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO A HOMELESS PERSON. VERSUS THE COST OF PROVIDING HOUSING OF SERVICES TO SUNDAY'S ADEQUATELY HOUSE. AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOUSING AS PART OF A SYSTEM NOT AS A STAND ALONE IN EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM THAT THE STATE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT HOUSING SO PROP FORTY SEVEN FOR EXAMPLE. EVERY SINGLE PERSON BEING RELEASED OR RELOCATED WHAT'S THE HOUSING SOLUTION FOR THAT PERSON IS TO BE A PART OF THE EQUATION OTHERWISE OUR EXPECTATIONS WELL. I'M. PROBABLY NOT BE REALIZED ONE OF THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE DON'T DEAL WITH DAY WE NEED TO DO AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IS IT'S EASY TO COUNT THE COST OF FEES IT'S EASY TO COUNT THE HARD COSTS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO COUNT THE COST OF TIME THE COSTA PROCESS. ACOSTA MEDICATIONS THE COST OF LITIGATION THE COST OF COMPLIANCE IS ALL OF THOSE SOFT COSTS ARE ESTIMATES AND ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT IN THE COST OF PRODUCING UNITS. IF WE KNOW THAT UP FRONT THEN WE CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT OKAY WHAT IS THIS OBLIGATION THAT WE'RE REQUIRING GOING TO COST THE PROJECT. AND WE CAN GET INTO THAT IN WHATEVER LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU WANT. AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'D MAKE IS WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE HOW'D WE PRODUCE MORE HOUSINGMANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSING ON THE DEMAND SIDE. AND EVERYTIME WE FURTHER FIND THE DEMAND SIDE WE FURTHER INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING AND THAT SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING ON THE DEMAND SIDE AND. GET INTO THAT HAVE WHATEVER LEVEL OF DETAIL I WAS TOLD I HAD FIVE MINUTES THAT SIX MINUTES AND THIRTEEN SECONDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DID NOTICE THE FINAL MINUTE AND THIRTEEN SECONDS YEAH SHE HALF. ARE. THE SOMEONE. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH I'VE I'VE BEEN TO THE SITE. I WAS AT THE SIDETO BEFORE WHEN IT WAS CALLED WATERMAN GARDENS. AND OF THE TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN THAT AND THE HOUSING THAT YOU NOW HAVE PROVIDED TO THE RESIDENTS IS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NIGHT AND DAY. AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT HOUSE TO BE THE WAY IT IS DONE. WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND NOT JUST ONE. WHEN WHEN HOUSING UNIT IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE A COMPLETE COMMUNITY. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I KNOW IN BLOOMINGTON. THAT THAT WAS A TRANSFORMATIVE. AREA AS WELL I I'M SO GLAD LISA THAT YOU'RE PART OF THAT BECAUSE THAT TRANSFORM THE VALLEY BOULEVARD NO WAY THAT. COULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED COULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF SUPERVISORS JOSIE GONZALEZ ON THAT. THAT REALLY WAS. TRANCE FORMATION NO. THANK YOU SO. I HAVE JUST A COMMENT AND A QUESTION THE COMMENT. OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I HAD A BILL CALLED. HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS TRYING TO BREAK DOWN SOME THE SILOS BETWEEN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THE HOUSING SYSTEM THE IDEA BEING THAT. IT IS FAR MORE HUMANE RATHER THAN LEAVING SOMEONE CHRONICALLY. HOMELESS ON THE STREETS AND THEN TRYING TO ADDRESS HEALTH ISSUES AFTER THE FACT TO ACTUALLY BUILD SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS IT'S. IT'S CHEAPER AND ITS FORMER HE MADE ALL THE BILL WAS INITIALLY VETOED BUT WITH ACTUALLY THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF ALL OF OUR LEGISLATORS HERE. THE GOVERNOR DID SIGN IT LAST YEAR AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT YOU MENTIONED SOME STATISTICS. THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED I WOULD LOVE TO GET THOSE HERE IS WE'RE% TRYING TO BASICALLY PROVE THE CASE THAT. WE CAN USE OUR SCARCE PUBLIC DOLLARS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU HOUSE PEOPLE. TO ADDRESS THEIR CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES EARLY OF SOAPS OF THANK YOU FOR THAT MY QUESTION THOUGH THAT YOU REFERENCED A TAX CREDIT. BEFORE AND YOU MAY KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO. ACTUALLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAD ANOTHER BILL. WHICH WOULD HAVE FOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT I WANNA THANK. MISTER STEINORTH FOR A BEEN A PRINCIPAL COAUTHOR THAT BILL. WE HAD A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS AT SUPPORT AT THAT. STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED IT. WE ARE THINKING AT THIS TIME THAT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THAT. PARTICULAR SENSOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX PLANS WHILE THEY CERTAINLY HAD BENEFITS FOR CORPORATIONS AND PROBABLY HIGHER NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS ARE AS YOU KNOW GOT IT ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING. A YEAR TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. PATCH THE HOLE WOULD YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT ATTEMPT TO. EXPAND THE FOR THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT HERE IN OUR STATE. YEAH A GREAT QUESTION YELL AT ULTIMATELY IT'S A MATH PROBLEM. AND SO THAT THAT THE BALANCING ACT AND AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THE NEXT PHASE OF WATERING GARDENS IT WHO IS. PLANNED TO BE A FOUR PERCENT TAX CREDIT PHASE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CURRENT APPLICATION TO THE STREET YOU GROWTH COUNSEL FOR CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. WHICH SHOULD BE THE FIRST SPECIFIC AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT FUNDED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION SUPPORT AND IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE SOME THE FROM SAN CISCO SUPPORTING A PROJECT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AFFECT AFFECT AFFECT OUT IN A TREE LANDING. A. SO PLEASE LET ME THAT INFORMATION I GUESS. YEAH YEAH THE QUESTION THOUGH IS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THAT EQUITY VALUE CREATED BY THE STATE TAX CREDIT AND HOW COULD THAT BE LAYERED INTO A PROJECT. WHAT MAKES THE FOUR PERCENT TAX CREDIT EFFECTIVE AT WATER REGARDS IS BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS BE TIED TO THE FOUR PERCENT CREDIT? THEY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS THE NINE PERCENT CREDIT IS SO COMPETITIVE. AND YOU KNOW SUCH A LIMITED SUPPLY THAT WORK BECAUSE HE LOOKING FOR WAYS IS HOW DO WE MAKE FOUR PERCENT CREDIT DEALS WORK AND HOW DO WE FUND THOSE GAPS. ANSWER REALLY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBERS IN THE STATE TAX CREDIT BE HAPPY TO HAVE MY TEAM WORK WITH YOUR TEAM I JUST DOING SOME POTENTIAL PRO FORMAS. TO SHOW HOW THOSE NUMBERS WOULD STACK UP IN A PROJECT AND. INNOCENTLY MAKE THE CASE FOR OKAY AT THIS PRICE WITH THIS BENEFIT THIS IS THEN HOW WOULD BE ABLE TO FILL A GAP. HAVE A GREAT I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SURLY. I HAVE A QUESTION AS WELL TO GIVE STEVE A SHOUT OUT FOR ALL HIS HELP IN ONTARIO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER. THAT WITH THAT WHEN WE GO TO OF MISS ROSA. AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MARIA RAZA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY OF SYNERGY NOTHING YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON. I AM AS A WAY OF BACKGROUND OR AGENCY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE COUNTIES SERVING NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. THROUGH OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HOUSING AND HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE HAVE US HOUSING. AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES ARE THAT UNLIKE OTHER HEALTH AND. HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. WE PROVIDE HOUSING ASSISTANCE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AND FAMILIES THAT. WE ARE AUTHORIZED AND FUNDED THROUGH HAD. UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED TO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE HOUSING ASSISTANCE. AND AND THAT IS REFLECTED BY THE FACT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND FAMILIES. ACROSS OUR VARIOUS A WAITING LIST HOWEVER THIS IS. FIFTEEN THOUSAND YES. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT'S NOT REPRESENTATIVE AT THE DEMAND WITHIN OUR COUNTY. AS. AND MISS AS REVISOR GONZALEZ MENTIONED THAT AND THE SEVERAL WAITING LISTS ARE. OPEN AND SOME ARE CLOSED A AS AN EXAMPLE OUR LARGEST A WAITING LIST FOR THE TENANT BASED VOUCHERS PROGRAM HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. AS A RESULT OF THAT DEMAND WE OPENED IT FOUR AND NINETEEN DAY PERIOD AND WE RECEIVED OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS FOR THAT WAITING LIST. SO AND AS FAMILIES M. HOPEFULLY MOVE THROUGH VARIOUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS NEW FAMILIES ARE PULLED FROM THE US WAITING LESS. AND SO AS A RESULT IT TAKES MANY YEARS FOR FAMILIES TO RECEIVE HOUSING ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER I WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE HOUSING CHALLENGES THINKS TO SEVERAL INNOVATIVE APPROACHES I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE THIS AFTERNOON. OUR SPECIAL DESIGNATION AS CALLED MOVING TO WORK AND ALSO OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH NONPROFIT. SO I'D LIKE TO ELABORATE ON ARE MOVING TOWARD DESIGNATION OUR HOUSING AUTHORITY IS ONLY ONE PERCENT OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE OVER THIRTY TWO HUNDRED. THAT HAVE A SPECIAL DESIGNATION BY CONGRESS FOR HIGH PERFORMING AGENCIES CALLED MOVING TO WORK. AND AND WHAT IT ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO DEVELOP TRANSFORM AND ESTABLISH LOCAL HOUSING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THAT BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HERE WITHIN OUR COUNTY. SO THE NAME OF THAT DESIGNATION CAN BE A BIT CONFUSING. AND THAT IS IT NOT. ONLY LEADS TO AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT THROUGH EMPLOYMENT. BUT AND THE THREE PRIMARY GOALS ARE TO HELP EACH FAMILIES ACHIEVE ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE. AT TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH THE VARIOUS HOUSING OPTIONS M. IS AN EXAMPLE OPEN UP HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. AND. I. LOOK I AM HIGHER AND INCOME AREAS AND TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES. WE HAVE USES DESIGNATION IN A WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS. TO HELP FINANCE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WHEN SUCH EXAMPLES ARROWHEAD GROW. TO ACQUIRE HOUSING AND OR ESTABLISH NEW LOCAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS ARE NO CHILD LEFT AND SHELTERED PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM. WAS CREATED TO HOUSE TRULY HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND COULD ONLY BE DONE AS A RESULT OF OUR MOVING TO WORK DESIGNATION.

THAT PLAN FOR US TO HAVE ALL THESE WAREHOUSES IN THE IN THE EMPIRE WHAT ALL THIS LAND THEM LACKEY YOUR NEXT GENERATION HOUSING ADVOCATES IN THE MARIN SHIRTS HERE IN AND ALL THAT THEY ARE DOING. I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION SO I ASKED MY STAFF. AS WE IT'S HEARINGS AROUND THE STATE'S TO GIVE ME THE. ARTICLES ABOUT THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS AND ONE THING THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT FROM THE ARTICLES THAT I READ ON THE PLANE DOWN HERE ROUTES AMBER MEDINA WAS. THAT THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS ONE. THAT. APPEAR TO BE SO PREDOMINANT IN YOUR NUMBERS AND. TO YOU IN ANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS IS THIS DIFFERENT PERCENT VERMENTINO WAR DECEMBER TO DO YOU KNOW. IT. IT IT BETTER AT IDENTIFYING AND I'M JUST FROM UNDERSTAND WHY THE NUMBER SEE SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE. ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN OTHER REGIONS OR YOU JUST BETTER AT KNOWING THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IDENTIFIED IT AND TRY TO ADDRESS IT. I DO HONESTLY AS PART OF CONTINUE HERE DAY WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS COUNTY A VERY GOOD JOB ORGANIZING VOLUNTEERS PUT APPOINT TIME COUNT. BECAUSE THERE WAS A TIME THAT HE WAS ABLE TO ACT WE GET REAL NUMBERS RIGHT NOW TO GET SOME WE COLLAPSE THEIR PARTNERS THAT'S COME OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. AND WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF COLLECTING THAT DATA I WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO JOE COMMITTEE OVER THE HILL PLEASE GET EFFORT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THAT COUNT AND SO THEY ARE HOMELESS WOMEN OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHILDREN IT'S IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IT TRYING TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK AS YOU SEE IN THAT VIDEO SOME OF THE CAME UP WITH OUR KEY IT AS THOUGH SHE GOT HOUSING WITHIN TWO WEEKS AGO OUR KIDS BACK. RIGHT THEY GOT THE CLOCK HIDDEN RAN OUT AND SO YOU KNOW THE WOMEN ARE OUT THERE AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FROM WHAT GENDER PERSPECTIVE. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED A WOMEN AND WOMEN GIRLS IN THIS COUNTY AND HAVE A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SAFE THE PUCK APOSTATE HOUSES WE HAVE BEEN HERE ARE PROVIDED FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THINGS TO REALIZE ABOUT SAMMY ACCOUNT. AS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE AREA. HAS SEX TRAFFICKING THE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. BECAUSE WHERE THE CROSSROADS SO EITHER THEY'RE COMING DOWN NORTH OR SOUTH THEY'RE COMING FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST FOR COMING OUT OF LA AND SO THIS IS AS WE ARE THE SHIPPING AND AND A MANUFACTURING HUB. ROUTES OF THE HUB THE TRAFFICKING OF MOSTLY WOMEN. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS. THAT I THINK APPROPRIATELY THE G. DE CRIMINALIZATION OF THAT UNDER AGE SEX TRAFFICKERS. HOWEVER WHAT THEY DID WAS IT TOOK AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MOVE THEM INTO A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. AND SO NOW WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY RELEASED WITHOUT ANY PLACE TO GO. AND SO THERE'S A GAP IN THEIR THINKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM. ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFIES UNDER AGE WOMEN IN THE SEX TRAFFIC BUSINESS WHEN THEY CAN'T INTERVENE AND THEY HAVE NO PLACE FOR THEM TO GO? AND SO WE ARE THE CROSSROADS OF THAT IN CHAMBER DINO COUNTY AND SO THAT MADE FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HOMELESS. ASPECT OF WOMEN WITHIN THE COUNTY. IT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO ALSO THANK GOD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ELOISE. FOR A CO AUTHORED A BILL THAT WE HAVE THE TWO OF US HAVE THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS THE PLIGHT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WHO HAPPENED TO BE TENANTS. BOB BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE SITUATION AROUND THAT THE STATE WHERE OF YOUR TALENT AND YOU'VE EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A PARTICULAR HOME. THE FACT THAT COPS ARE CALLED TO YOUR HOUSE COULD BE USED BY THE LANDLORD AS. BASIS TO ADDICT YOU AND WE WANT TO CHANGE THOSE RULES SO THAT IS NOT THE CASE SO I THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT PERSPECTIVE AND NOW I KNOW WHY. LUIS YOU ARE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE. WITH THAT BACK TO YOU. YOU HEAR FROM SO MANY BE ADVOCATES HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU DELAY YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING I'M AS I'M WAS MENTIONED DOCTOR BUT HE'S ACTUALLY HERE WE CAN AVE HIM AND PROVIDE TO YOU SOME WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE HE DOES FOLLOW THE ONE IN FOUR WOMEN ISSUES WHICH.

THANK YOU LESTER ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS PANEL ONE JUST THANK THIS PANEL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR WORDS AND EXPERTISE SO FEEL FREE TO SEND US MORE INFORMATION BASED ON THE CONVERSATION. I'D LIKE TO BUY UP THE FINAL PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS. AND THIS IS A PANEL ON HOMELESSNESS ON THE AVERAGING. RESOURCES LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO SONYA THOMAS. DOCTOR JOE COLLETTI WHO IS THE CEO OF URBAN INITIATIVES AND DR JENNIFER SALES THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF INLAND EMPIRE. HEALTH. WELCOME. NOW WHEN WE START. WITH THIS THOMAS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHIU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATOR LEYVA. AS THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FREE HUMAN SERVICES WHICH ENCOMPASSES OUR DEPARTMENT OF BE CAREFUL HOUSE WITH SERVICE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. VETERAN AFFAIRS TRANSITIONAL SURFACED APARTMENTS CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES. PUBLIC HEALTH AGING ADULT SERVICES CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AND PRESCHOOL SERVICES. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE IN DIRE NEED OF HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. SO IT'S A PLEASURE THIS AFTERNOON TO SPEAK WITH YOU ON HOUSE EVERYDAY NO COUNTY HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES. I'M SO HONORED IN MY HEART ACTUALLY. IS. BEATING OUTSIDE MY CHEST BECAUSE I THINK YOU GOT A SENSE OF HOW WE HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AND CREATIVE I WANT TO APPLAUD THE PREVIOUS PANELS YOU SAW. THE INTELLIGENCE THE. CONFIDENCE THAT PASSION AND THAT ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE HAVE HERE AND SALMON A DINO. SO THROUGH THE PROGRESSIVE LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL WILL OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OUR C. O.. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS A VIEWPOINT ON. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THAT CUTE NEEDS TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO REMAIN STABLE IN THEIR HOMES. SO IF WHETHER YOU ARE THIS TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR OF AGING ADULT SERVICE THIS YEAR DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. YOU ARE APPLYING. YOUR RESOURCES IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ARE TOWARD. AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS TO SUSTAIN THEM IN THEIR HOME. AS YOU HEARD FROM ONE OF THE PANELISTS TODAY THERE'S STILL A UNIQUE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON CERTAIN TARGET POPULATIONS THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE FOCUS IN THE PAST. WE HAVE SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS AS IT WAS PRESS TO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WE HAVE LOTS OF SERVICES FOR VETERANS BUT THERE'S A UNIQUE AS YOU. MENTIONED CHAIRMAN CHIU REGARDING. THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN. AHMED ALSO OUR SENIOR POPULATION THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY GROWING AND THEIR ART DEDICATED RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS ISSUES OF OUR SENIORS. SO ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN ASSIST US IS TO ENSURE THAT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AREADEQUATELY FUNDED HELP US. OR MAINTAIN OUR SERVICES TO HOMELESS POPULATION TO SECURE THE MENTAL HEALTH pSERVICES ACT IT IS A PROP SIXTY. THREE FUNDED. THROUGH. A TAX INITIATIVE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AS YOU SAW IN THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE. THERE'S ALL OF THEM CALLS UPON THEIR RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR IMAGES SAY BUT IF THOSE FUNDS CONTINUE TO BE DIVERTED OR DEPLETED WHO HAVE LEFT FUNDS TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE A SUPPORT OF SERVICES. THAT ARE SO. GREATLY NEEDED TO MAINTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR HOME. ANOTHER FOCUS IS TO CONTINUE ON PROBABLY REDUCTION AND FAMILY STABILIZATION TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY PROVIDING INSIGHT THAT I THINK PUBLIC HOUSING. AS ONE OF THE. THOMAS MAJID EARLIER TODAY WE HAVE A LOT OF OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE. DESIGNED BASED ON THE PRIVATE MARKETS WHERE WE PROVIDING RENT SUBSIDIES I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY AS MS CARTER MENTIONED WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. PROVIDING OTHER LEVELS OF. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WITH THE COUNTIES COUNTY WIDE. VISION WE HAVE A HOUSING ELEMENT ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES HERE IS TO PROMOTE RETHINKING. OF INCENTIVES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT ALLOW US TO HAVE. A PERMIT SUPPORT OF VOUCHERS BUT ALSO LOOK AT OTHER ON HOUSING CONSTRUCTS. SO. IN THE THICK OF TIME I WILL. BRIEF MY PRESENTATION SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR. FROM SOME OF OUR OTHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF AN BENITO COUNTY AND YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY. YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR COLLETTI. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS JOE COLLETTI WITH URBAN INITIATIVES AND BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION I DO WANT TO. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE QUICKER GOING TO DO THE JOB. FORWARDING MY AND. WHAT AFFAIRS? SO WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING I DO I MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT ONE IN FOUR ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND WOMEN HERE IN A IN A COUNTY IN THAT. THE THAT THE PERCENTAGE. OF. OF WOMEN THAT MAKE UP THE HOMELESS POPULATION HERE IN THE COUNTY IS AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING ONE OF ONE FOR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THAT'S BEEN UP. A PERCENTAGE THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE SEEN. AND THE ONE THING THAT I FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE VERY REMISS. AYE IF I DIDN'T MENTION WITHIN THIS CONTEXT BECAUSE. AT THE END OF WHAT THEY SAID THAT WILL SEND YOU THE DATA ON THAT WE HAVE. BUT DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A QUICK MOMENT JUST TO SAY THAT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. IS A MAJOR. MAJOR NEED HERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOMELESS WOMEN. YOU KNOW THE THE ISSUES ARE COMPOUNDED. YOU IN SUCH A WAY THAT AGAIN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. YOU'LL BE UP IS A SIGN AT THE TRAINING THAT SHOULD BE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW THE CASE MANAGERS EXTRATERRESTRIAL. DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. THE MOMENT SO BY WAY OF MY PRESENTATION. I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON FIVE. HOW COLUMN SUGGESTIONS AT THIS POINT? THAT COME OUT OF OUR EXPERIENCE HERE IN THE COUNTY. AND THAT IS THIS THE FIRST ONE. IS THAT YES YOU SEE A. TABLE. OF OUR HOMELESS COUNT DATA FOR THE PAST. FOR YEARS. AND. AS YOU KNOW OFTEN. THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BILLS THAT ARE. TYING THE FUNDING TO A HOMELESS COUNT. IT'S GENERALLY THE MOST CURRENT HOMELESS COUNT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN IN IN THE COUNTY. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS YOU CAN SEE THAT. THERE HAD BEEN DECREASES. YOU KNOW MEANING THAT THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. IS GIVING EVIDENCE THAT THE JOB. IT'S BEING DONE. AND IF YOU JUST HIGH. FUNDING TO A NUMBER. THAT'S PERHAPS THE LARGEST NUMBER YOU KNOW WITHIN A GIVEN COUNTY. THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING. ARE YOU FUNDING. YOU KNOW A A A COUNTY THAT HAS AN INCREASING AMOUNT. OF HOMELESSNESS. AND OR ARE YOU FUNDING A COUNTY THAT HAS THE DECREASING. AMOUNT HISTORICALLY YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT. THERE USE TO BE A TIME WHERE. IT WAS JUST. PURELY YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE THE NUMBERS ARE GETTING MORE GIVE US MORE MONEY GIVE US MORE MONEY GIVE US MORE MONEY AS WE GOT MORE PERFORMANCE CONSCIOUS AND MORE PERFORMANCE BASED. NO THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT THEIR ABOUT FUNDING BEING TIED TO. PERFORMANCE AND THUS A DECREASE THEN NUMBER SO I WOULD SAY THAT. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THE HOMELESS COUNT THAT IS BEING USED PERHAPS. WE CAN DO SOMETHING MORE WITH THAT THE JUST LOOK AT A ONE A NUMBER FOR A. THE MOST CURRENT YEAR AND PERHAPS EVEN DO A COMPARISON. SO. WITH THAT I WON A NOTE WITH MY SON A SECOND SUGGESTION. IN MATTERS THAT READ A POINT NOW WHERE WE'RE NO LONGER USING ANECDOTAL INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND HOMELESSNESS I CAN REMEMBER THOSE DATES. YOU KNOW AND AND BASICALLY ONE PERSON WE GET UP AND SAY WELL THE FASTEST GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION IS. YOU KNOW THIS GROUP AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH A NARROW AT THIS GROUP AND AND AND THAT TYPE OF A THING SO NOW WE HAVE DATA YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST. FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO AND THOSE SOURCES OF DATA ARE. THE HOMELESS COUNT. THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT AFFIRMATION SYSTEM H. MY S. IN COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM WELL. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. THE POINT TIME COUNTY THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT THAT IN THE AND THE USE OF IT. BUT. IN THAT'S BEING MORE EMBEDDED INTO. YOUR LEGISLATION HOWEVER. HMIS IS NOT. THAT'S RARELY LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF ABOUT AT LEAST WHAT I READ THROUGH THE VARIOUS BILLS IS IT'S RARELY MENTION. AND YET. IT'S A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. IN A MORE ROBUST THE AND A SYSTEM. THEN THE POINT CONCURRENT. AND HERE IN THE COUNTY. HAS A VERY ROBUST. MRS. WHERE THE USE OF AGE MY S. IS BEING USED? AND A LOT OF WAYS THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TOWARDS. VETERANS GETTING VETERANS OFF THE STREETS AND THAT. LARGELY THROUGH. THE USE OF HMIS DATA IN YOU PROBABLY KNOW OF A OF A BY NAME LIST. AND HOW THAT'S BEING USED. AND THE SIESTA COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM. GENERALLY IS EMBEDDED IN THE TO MY S.. SO IF YOU'RE GONNA FOCUS MORE AND THAT'S MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS THAT. DO WHAT'S BEING DONE HERE YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE. OTHERS TO USE HMIS. AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBEDDED INTO LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE BEGINNING TO DO WITH THE POINT TEN COUNT. DOCTOR BEFORE YOU MOVE OFF THIS POINT I JUST WANNA MATCH MY COLLEAGUES ARE WE DO HAVE A BILL THAT'S ACTUALLY PROPOSING THAT WE DO EXACTLY THAT THE CROWDS ACTUALLY BILL THAT. LISA HAD SUGGESTED THAT. THAT WE AUTHORED IT'S. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE OUGHT TO YOUR POINT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COUNTY CITIES OVER THE LAST. TEN OR SO YEARS HAVE STARTED TO TRACK THIS INFORMATION BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS NOT UNLIKE OTHER STATES AND SO. UP SO I AM PROPOSING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO WERE STARTING THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE NOT EVEN HAD A FIRST HEARING ON THIS TOPIC BUT. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO SEND ME INFORMATION THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE MAY. WE MAY DRAG YOU BACK UP SACRAMENTO TO TESTIFY AGAIN ON THAT I SEE IT WE HAD TO DO THIS ABBY ABBY TO COME AND I WOULD. COME A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED ABOUT THAT BUT MY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE IS THAT. IT FOCUSING MORE ON A STATEWIDE DATABASE RIGHT. AND SO. AND AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT AT A WHAT FIVE OR SIX YOU WHATEVER WAS TO KIND OF DO THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. IT HOPEFULLY THIS TIME IT IS GOING TO WORK OUT. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THAT DATABASE. THAT LARGE THAT IS. STATE DATABASE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WILL THAT DATA THEN BE AVAILABLE TO A GIVEN COUNTY IN EACH IN EACH OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I MEAN I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE. THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THE USES OF IT OTHERWISE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THIS WONDERFUL STATEWIDE DATA. AMERICAN IMAGINE ONCE IT HOPEFULLY THE BILL PASSES EVERYTHING YOU KNOW EVERYTHING HAPPENS. AND THOUGH YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL. DATABASE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE BUT. COUNTIES WHEN INDEED THE BREAKDOWN. RELEASE WOULD BE HOPEFUL AT ONE END AND TO THAT POINT YOUR APPS TO RIGHT ITSELF. I THINK THE GOAL OVER TIME IS TO FIGURE OUT IF ALL CITIES ARE ARE ARE ARE GETTING THIS INFORMATION COUNTIES ARE GETTING THIS INFORMATION. WE CAN THEN HELP REGION'S UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH PATTERNS OF HOMELESS MIGRATION. AND AND MOVEMENT AND AND SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED. ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY DONE A VERY GOOD BAD JOB OF THE SORT OF LARGER. IT DATA PROJECTS AND BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY SEAMLESSLY WITH LOCALS BUT THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE MY HOPE. BUT BUT TO IT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT. SO. THIRTY JUSTIN FOCUSES ON DETERMINING NEED. AND WHEN THE. WHEN HARD INTRODUCED THE. HOW ARE THEY ACT CONTINUE OF CARE PROGRAM INTERIM RULE? BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. RIGHT. BOB THAT WAS A SHIFT FOR EVERYBODY MATCHES HERE IN THE COUNTY BUT EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ALL FOUR HUNDRED PLUS. TEAMS OF CARE NOW HAD THE COUNTY GET WITH THE WITH THE INTERIM RULE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY. HARD TO ADJUST TO. BUT. HERE IN THE COUNTY QUICKLY ADJUSTED TO BUT THE ONE THING THAT WAS HARD TO ADJUST TO WAS. THAT HAVE JUST THE V. D. SYDNEY THE. THE DECISION MAKERS WERE PRIMARILY THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IF YOU TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND WENT TO A. HOMELESS COALITION MEETING IN A GIVEN. COUNTY OR SO TEN YEARS AGO OR SO. IT WAS DOMINATED BY HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. AND DOING A LOT OF GREAT WORK. BUT NOBODY ELSE WOULD BE AT THE TABLE. IF YOU WENT TO THAT MEETING. YOU KNOW YOU B. WONDERING WHY MY THEIR AND I'M NOT SURE. BUT NEVER COMING BACK BECAUSE HE GOT ALL THE SERVICE BY PROVIDERS TALKING ABOUT THEIR THINGS IN THEIR LANGUAGE. AND IT WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE INTERIM RULE IS THAT. THERE WAS A CHANGE AND THAT THE INTERIM RULE IS NOW ENCOURAGING BUSINESSES LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVES YOU KNOW TO BECOME. MORE INCREASINGLY VISIBLE AN ACTIVE. AND SO HERE AND. THERE'S THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS CHAIRED BY. PROVIDER GONZALEZ. AND. SHE ARE AND THEN SO BE IT YOU IF YOU WERE AT ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS YOU WOULD SEE THAT THERE'S A LARGE REPRESENTATION BY. BEYOND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND SO. IT THERE WAS AN INITIAL FEAR. BECAUSE I WAS INVOLVED IN IN. IN IN A LOT OF THIS EARLY ON. THAT WHAT YOU KNOW YOU BRING THESE FOLKS AND YOU KNOW THESE BUSINESS FOLKS OR YOU KNOW EVEN IF SOMEBODY FROM. UNIVERSITY THEN YOU KNOW CORPORATION OR SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE ANAL ABOUT HOMELESSNESS KNOWS IT WAS HIS FEAR OF THIS LEARNING CURVE. YOU KNOW LIKE WITH YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT GUESS WHAT YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE WHILE? BUT LIKE HERE IN THE COUNTY IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT FOLKS. THAT PERHAPS MOST OF THEM RUN LEARNING CURVE. AND THEY GOT WITH THE PROGRAM. THEY VERY ARTICULATE ABOUT THE ISSUES. VERY MUCH UNDERSTANDING SO THAT INITIAL FEAR. IS NOT TRUE SO TO WHATEVER DEGREE. YOU CAN BET SOMETHING LIKE THIS INTO LEGISLATION. PLEASE DO. PLEASE DO IT OF HIS A SAID THE INITIAL FINDINGS IN THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING IS JUST THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY. IT WOULD GIVE. YOU KNOW COUNTIES BY COUNTIES I MEAN YOU KNOW NOT JUST A COUNTY ITSELF BUT ALL OF ITS PARTNERS YOU KNOW SOMETHING MORE TO POINT TO. AND THE COURAGE OF OTHERS TO BE PART OF. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO WHATEVER DEGREE YOU CAN EMBED THAT INTO LEGISLATION. PLEASE DO THAT. THEN. THE. FOR THINK THAT ONE OF FIVE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS HISTORICAL PARTNERSHIPS. BECAUSE. BRINGING THE COUNTY TOGETHER WHICH CITY OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS HOMELESSNESS. AS A START BUT IT IT IT'S. NOT ENOUGH. IT MAY NOT ENOUGH. AND THEY HAVE CITY OFFICIALS NEED TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ANY HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY. OKAY WE NEED CITY OFFICIALS. NEED TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THAT BUT. WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN YOU CAN LOOK AT? THE HOMELESS COUNT DATA HERE. IS THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO A CITY COUNCIL MEETING. AND THE ADVENTURES SEVERAL RIGHT YOU HAVE THE TWENTY FOUR CITIES HERE. YOU DON'T HAVE SAME CONVERSATIONS AS YOU DO AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. YOU CAN JUST. A FEW OF THE CITY'S YES. BUT MOST NO BY THAT I MEAN. YOU KNOW THAT THE YET WHAT IS HOUSING FIRST RAPID RE HOUSING OR COORDINATED ENTRIES. ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU KNOW AND SO. A LOT OF CITIES DON'T HAVE. THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. I DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ALL THAT. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT COULD HELP. THEM. ACHIEVE THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF THAT. IS TAKING HOMELESS COUNT DATA AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF THE HERE. IS A TWENTY SEVENTEEN NUMBERS FOR THE COLONY. AND OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR CITIES YOU HAVE JUSTICE. SIX THAT ARE LISTED HERE THOSE WITH THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION. AND THEY MAKE UP FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF. BALL THE TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION SO I MEAN EVEN WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSING ON CITIES. YOU'VE ENTIRE GET AYE HANDFUL OF CITIES AND BY WAY OF WHICH MAY BE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR CITIES BUT THEY'RE REPRESENTING MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR HOMELESS POPULATION. AND SO THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THAT. I WANT TO UNDERLINE IS LIKE TAKING ONTARIO. IS AN EXAMPLE. I'M OFTEN WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE WELL JUST GONNA PUT BACK FOR A MOMENT AND JUST SAY WELL WE HAVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX HOMELESS PERSONS RIGHT. ALRIGHT WE HAVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX HOMELESS PERSONS LET'S AND HOMELESSNESS FOR ALL EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. COMES ACROSS AS PRETTY DAUNTING RIGHT. BUT HOWEVER WHEN YOU'RE BREAKING THE DATA DOWN. SO LIKE HERE YOU HAVE FOR THE CITY ONTARIO WAS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS FIFTY NINE PERSONS WERE COUNTED HAS ON SHELTERED. YOU SELL ONE YOU KNOW STRIP TENURE THE CITY COUNCIL AUTUMN YOU KNOW AND AND WE'RE HITTING YOU WITH THIS THIS INFORMATION WELL. YOU KNOW WE COME TO YOU AND SAY THERE'S EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX YOUR PERCENT HOMES IN THE COUNTY FIRST THING PROBABLY ONE IS WILLING TO DO IT ALL THIS COUNTY INFORMATION. GIVE ME CITY INFORMATION SO WE START FEELING OF THIS. CITY INFORMATION THAN SOMETHING LIKE A DAUNTING EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX NUMBER MAY. OT COME ACROSS SO DAUNTING ONCE WE BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW IN CITY OF ONTARIO. WAS FIFTY NINE PERSONS RECOUNTED ISN'T SHELTERED BY THE WAY. NINETEEN OR WOMEN. ALLISON YOU'RE THINKING WELL YOU KNOW. CAN'T WE KNOW THOSE NINETEEN WOMEN YOU KNOW KELLY EN THAT FOR THOSE NINETEEN WOMEN OKAY EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN. THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX WITH O'CONNELL COUNTY IS PRETTY DAUNTING. BUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS SIX VETERANS. I KNOW THE FIFTEEN. FOR YOU. AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY. CAN'T WE GET THOSE FOR YOU. ONE SENIOR AGE SIX. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE USING THE DATA IN SUCH A WAY. THAT. FOLLOW SAID IN ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND SEEM TO BE SUCH A. I OUT OF OUT OF REACH THINK WE COULD ACTUALLY BEGIN. TO DO THAT. AND SO. THE LAST. SUGGESTION THAT I HAVE FOCUSES ON COORDINATING AND CONCENTRATING. I RESOURCES. AND SO HERE IN THE COUNTY. IN IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDS STATE FUNDS AND COUNTY FUNDS. IT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY DONE PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HERE. AND THEN AND ELSEWHERE. BUT OFTEN CITY FUNDS. YOU KNOW OUR YOU NO PARTICULATES ARE CTG DOLLARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY'RE NOT AS OFTEN TIED TO THE ABOVE FUNDING. YOU NO AND SO. ARE IN A PRIVATE FUNDS OFTEN ARE TIGHT IT'S JUST GENERALLY. YOU HAVE. YOU DON'T NOT PROFITS. WRITING GRANT APPLICATIONS BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL UP WITH THE PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS. WANT THE FUNDS SERVE NONPROFITS FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE THAT WORK. HERE IN THE COUNTY AND PRIVATE FUNDS THOUGH YOU HAVE YOU ALREADY HEARD. SOMEWHAT ABOUT THE AYE HP AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR MORE ABOUT IT IN JUST. A MOMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP THERE AND HOW THOSE THESE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE DOLLARS ARE BEING LEVERAGED YOU KNOW. BUT. WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU BY WAY OF THIS SUGGESTION IS TO TO WHATEVER YOU COULD ENCOURAGE WHATEVER YOU CAN DO THAT ENCOURAGES CITIES? THE TIGHTER FUNDING AND I KNOW SOME OF THAT'S BEING DONE IN SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY BILLS WHERE YOU'RE WHERE THE COUNTIES WHERE YOU'RE GIVING MONEY THE COUNTIES BUT THEN YOU'RE BEING TIED TO THE CITY'S. THAT'S A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN THE MORE YOU CAN DO. IN REGARDS TO THAT THE BETTER. GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT WHEN WE GO TO OUR FINAL PRESENTATION. DOCTOR SEUSS. RIGHT. SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE VENDOR COUPLE REFEREE LAWYER MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER OKAY. OTHER IN IF YOU REFERENCES TO TO US TODAY SO I'M GONNA ACTUALLY START WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN. UP A JENNIFER SALES IN THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER THERE AND WHERE THE LOCAL INITIATIVE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN THIS RESERVE REGION RESIDENTIALLY JOINT POWERS AGENCY AJP A THAT WAS CREATED BY BOTH COUNTIES IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. TO RUN A MEDICAL HEALTH PLANS WE ARE THE PUBLIC PLAN WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING HERE JUST. BY WAY OF REFERENCE THAT WE SERVE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION MEMBERS THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE OUR MEDIC HAVE MEDI CAL. WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOLKS THAT ARE DUAL ELIGIBLES OF THEIR MEDICARE MEDICAID OUT JUST TO A PLAY OUT REGIONALLY WITHOUT MEANS THAT'S ABOUT ONE IN FOUR RESIDENTS IN BOTH AND PORTANTINO IT RIVERS LIKE. THAT ARE THAT ARE AYE EACH PP ASIANS AND TO QUALIFY FOR FOR MEDI CAL FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR ITS PREDOMINATELY AT. RESIDENTS AND INCOME REQUIREMENT OF UNDER AND THIRTY PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO. IN OUR WORLD. OUR MANAGED CARE MODEL ALLOWS US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE AND IMPORTANTLY REINVEST SAVINGS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY FOR OUR ULTIMATE GOAL OF. IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO WHY HOUSING AND HEALTH WHY AT THREE PM AND FRIDAY IS A PHYSICIAN SITTING UP HERE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOUSING. SO. INTERESTINGLY. AS A HEALTH PLAN HER GOAL IS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND IF YOU LOOK AT. WHAT ACTUALLY IMPACT HEALTH AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WELL KNOWN TO THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN ILL HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE ILL OR BEEN IN THE COMMUNITY BUT BUT US IN THE? ACADEMIC WORLD IN LITERATURE ROLE THERE WITH A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BEHIND. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND ACTUALLY THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL PRETTY SENTINEL STUDIES IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE THAT TALK ABOUT. HOW MUCH? HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY IMPACT HEALTH AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE IT'S ABOUT TEN PERCENT. THAT MAY HELP TO WARD OFF PREMATURE DEATH AND REALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT. REALLY AT LARGE COMBINATION OF BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH PATTERNS OF SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES WHICH BY COMPARISON RELATE TO ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF HEALTH AND THEN WE HAVE GENETICS AND SO. IN THIS EQUATION IF OUR GOAL IS TO IMPACT THE HEALTH OF OUR MEMBERS AND HOPEFULLY BY EXTENSION THE HEALTH OF FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AROUND THEM WE NEED TO BE BROADER WE NEED TO BE MORE HOLISTIC WE CAN'T FOCUS ONLY ON THE HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD BE THAT'S BEING DELIVERED. SO WE CALL THIS APPROACH OF LOOKING AT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND. AND WE AT AYE HP HAVE TAKEN AND. A PRETTY ACTIVE. ROLE IN TRYING TO STRATEGICALLY. THINK ABOUT AN INVEST WHERE WE CAN GET. THE MOST IMPACT IN TERMS OF OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS HOUSING IS COME UP AS NUMBER ONE IN TERMS OF. AWARE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST IMPACT. AND I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF DATA OUT IN THE LITERATURE THAT I CAN SAY TODAY ABOUT WHY THAT'S THE CASE. I THINK MOST OF US PROBABLY. RECOGNIZE IF WHERE IN THIS WORLD WHAT THAT CONNECTION LOOKS LIKE ALL GIVEN EXAMPLE A MEMBER MISTER PER AS WHICH IS NOT HIS REAL NAME BECAUSE WE CHANGED IT. WHO HAS CHRONIC DIABETES? HAS. PAIN IN HIS LIMBS BECAUSE ABOUT DIABETES IN THE POOR CONTROL DIABETES HAS ULCERS ON HIS LEGS. AND HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF A HOSPITAL. HE'S PROBABLY. MAYBE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING FOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR HIM. HIS PHYSICIANS ARE ALL FRUSTRATED THAT HE'S NOT TAKING HIS INSULIN AND ON HIS TEST STRIPS AND IF YOU JUST DIG A LITTLE BIT FURTHER YOU WOULD LEARN THAT HE. RECENTLY LOST HIS HOUSING WHERE HE WAS STAYING WITH HIS AUNT AND THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE. HE DOESN'T HAVE A STABLE SOURCE OF HOUSING HE'S ACTUALLY AND SHELTERED THAT HIS DAILY ACTIVITY IS OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON WHERE AM I GOING TO SEE TONIGHT HOW AM I GONNA STAY SAFE WHERE'S MY NEXT MEAL COMING FROM. AND WHETHER OR NOT HE'S YOU KNOW ABLE TO MONITOR HIS BLOOD SUGAR IS VERY LOW ON THE LEFT AND SO I THINK IT HEALTH CARE WE SOMETIMES REFERRED ABOUT WE MAKE JUDGMENTS. I THINK LISA TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE THAT WE'VE REFER TO THIS AS NON COMPLIANCE. THAT'S REALLY NOT THE CASE AT THE VERY RATIONAL DECISION THAT HE'S MAKING IN HIS CURRENT CONTACTS THAT WE NEED TO OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM RECOGNIZE THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE BUILD AROUND IT. DON'T GO FOR YOU YEAH YOU MENTIONED THE LITERATURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE WHERE THE LITERATURE BUT. I'D LOVE TO GET IT. ALL SENATORS THIS WOULD HAVE A MUCH YOUNGER SLIDE DECK I CONSIDER HAD ALTERED REFERENCE ERA. I THINK THOSE OF US WHO POLICYMAKERS WE KNOW THIS ANECDOTALLY BUT IF OUR IS ACTUALLY SCIENTIFICALLY INVENTED LITERATURE ON IT IN. MEDICAL JOURNALS AND OTHERS THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE YA ABSOLUTELY IMMIGRANT USUALLY DO THAT FOR YOU THANK THANK YOU FOR SURE. SO. FOR A FOR US AND I AGE P. THIS IS TRANSLATED INTO OUR FIRST. STEPPED INTO THE HOUSING WORLD AND WE HAVE A LOT OF GUIDANCE THANKFULLY FROM OUR. FAVOR TO DENOTE A COUNTY HEARD YOUR PARTNERS PARTICULARLY. AND SO I WILL DEFINITELY PROFESSED TO KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT HOUSING OF OUR PAY HER WHOLE. OF BUT I I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND REALLY OF MOST OF IT IS IS IS THAT. FOCUS ON ON COLLABORATION SO. WE LOOK TO GAPS WE LOOKED AT WHERE OUR FOLKS HAVING A HARD TIME ACCESS THING. ARE WEARING OUR OUR POPULATION BY EACH P. MEMBERS ARE THERE NOT NECESSARILY. GREAT. PROGRAMS VOUCHERS FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE COULD WE PLAY AGAIN AND ALSO ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT FIRST ROUND WHERE'S THAT MAKES THAT SO WE IDENTIFIED TWO GROUPS THAT WE ARE. WORKING WITH A ONE IS THOSE MEMBERS AND LONG TERM CARE AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING SITUATION. SOME MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PERSONALLY. AND AT AYE HP WE'VE ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS WHO ARE IN LONG TERM CARE AND WE ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT OF THEM. ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO BE THERE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE FACILITY IN FOR NURSING CARE. AND THOSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO AND THAT IS THE PREDOMINANT REASON THAT THEY'RE THERE AND SO. WE LOOKED AT WE ARE WE ARE ACTUALLY ENDED THINK OUR FIRST PATIENT CAME THROUGH TWO WEEKS AGO WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW COULD WE. TRANSITION FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LIVING BACK IN THE COMMUNITY AND DON'T HAVE A SKILLED NEED AND REALLY COULD WITH SUPPORTS BE SUCCESSFUL. UP MOVE BACK IN TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL PARTNERS WERE WORKING WITH THAT I WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE AND OUR GOAL OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IS TO TRANSITION A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. INDIVIDUALS INTO OUT OF ONE TERM CARE BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. OUR SECOND POPULATION IS THE OTHER BUBBLE UP THERE AND THAT IS WHO WE ARE WHO. WHERE WHERE ARE THREE EACH MEMBERS OF THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE? USING A WHOLE LOT OF HEALTH SERVICES ARE PRETTY UNSTABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR. BOTH PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL CONDITIONS AND. ARE HOMELESS AND AMONG THOSE WE HAVE SOME THAT WE NOR ELIGIBLE FOR HUD VOUCHERS AND WE PARTNER CLOSELY AND LOOK AT MATCHING FUNDS FOR FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS AND LEVERAGING THE COUNTIES. INTO THAT HAVING HIS MANAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR THOSE. WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HUD ABOUT FUNDING AND SO IF WE'RE PAYING. ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THESE FOLKS WHICH WE ARE FOR THEIR MEDICAL CARE. FOR US IT MAKES. BOTH HUMAN AND ECONOMIC SENSE TO LOOK AT HOW WE SUPPORT. THEIR HOUSING AS WELL. SO SO THAT THAT GROUP WE ARE LOOKING AT RENTALS SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE SUPPORT OF RAP SERVICES THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY PROVIDE AND SO THIS IS OUR FIRST ROUND OF LOOKING AT. A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MODEL. AND APPROACH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES. SO. YOU MIGHT OUT SCHOOL HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY WORK AND WHERE DID THE DOLLARS COME FROM SO AT THIS POINT OUR BOARD HAS GRACIOUSLY APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR US TO START THIS WORK. OF AND THIS IS ACROSS THE TWO COUNTIES OF RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNIE DO YOU KNOW. I AM CHOOSING THE THE MEMBERS THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS. INTO OBVIOUSLY HOW MIGHT IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WE ALSO LOOKED AT PUBS WERE PUBLIC AGENCY WERE USING PUBLIC DOLLARS SO WE WENT UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF SAVINGS AND ECONOMIC PIECE COULD WEIGH AND. AND SO FOR OUR LONG TERM CARE GROUP IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. THOSE FOLKS ARE ESSENTIALLY RECEIVING HOUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE AND WE'RE PAYING SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON AVERAGE FOR THEM. AND WE KNOW WE COULD SUPPORT THEIR HOUSING PLUS ALL OF THEIR INCOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND OTHER NEEDS LIKELY FOR AROUND HALF THAT COST. SO IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH FOR THAT GROUP. I THINK IT ALSO ARGUES THAT THAT IS A GOOD USE OF OF DOLLARS OVERALL. THE SECOND POPULATION IN THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF THE LITERATURE STANDS SO THAT'S WHAT ALL THE FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT THE COMMITTEE ON. IS LOOKING AT THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY UNSTABLE AND USING LOTS OF HEALTH SERVICES I HAVE MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES AND SO THERE ARE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT IS TREATING. RENTALS SUPPORT AND GETTING SOME OF STABILIZE IN PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH THOSE WRAP AROUND HIS MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR MANY MANY DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SO FINE AVERAGE IN SPENDING TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. ON SOMEONE IN A HOSPITAL AND A LOT OF OUR COUNTY HOSPITALS HAVE FOLKS INCLUDING AIR WHO REGIONAL WHO'VE BEEN THERE FOR MONTHS. WE COULD REALLY MUCH MORE USEFUL USE THOSE RESOURCES TO. ACTUALLY HOW THOSE FOLKS I MEAN FOR ME WITH A FOR US FOR THE MARKET RATE THE WAY IT IS IF I AVOID SEVEN DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL I COULD PAY A YEAR. SO YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT WHAT THOSE TRADE OFFS ARE AND AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BETTER IMPROVE. THE SITUATION FAIR FOR THOSE MEMBERS IS A SORT OF CRITICAL TO US. I I PAUSED AND MOVE ON JUST TO MY LAST FLIGHT ON OUR PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL. AND I I NEED TO POINT OUT THAT IF YOU ARE I'M THINKING YOU'RE ALREADY KNOW BUT. CMS DOES NOT ALLOW HOUSING COSTS TO BE IN MEDICAID PROGRAMMING SO WE ARE DOING THIS WITH OUR RESERVES AND THAT IS PART OF THAT MANAGED CARE MODEL IN THE FACT THAT IF WE CAN. BETTER MANAGE PATIENTS AND SAVE GENERALLY IN PATIENT BECAUSE WE CAN REINVEST THOSE DOLLARS IT'S A PUBLIC AGENCY BACK INTO. OF THE COMMUNITY AND IMPACTFUL PROGRAMS AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPACT OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN. IT'S PROBABLY NOT A SUSTAINABLE. MODEL IN THE SENSE THAT. WE NEED LONG TERM TO BE LOOKING AT BETTER. OF FINDING AN INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS BUT IT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW. SO IN TERMS OF PARTNERS. I HAVE TO MY RIGHT ONE OF OUR GREAT PARTNERS IN THE COUNTY OF HOW IN THE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. ARE BOTH THE HOUSING AGENCY AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN STRONG PARTNERS WE OBVIOUSLY MATCH WITH THEM FOR VOUCHERS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE LOOK AT WHAT WHO THEY CAN HOUSE WHO WE CAN HOUSE IF THERE'S OVERLAPPED. OF MEMBERSHIP. US ABOUT BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL PARTNER WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH. INSTITUTE ON AGING WHICH IS PROVIDING A LOT OF THOSE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES FOR OUR MEMBERS OUT OF LONG TERM CARE. WE PARTNER WITH MULTIPLE LOCAL ICM AS ORGANIZATIONS FOR THAT AND HAS A HOUSING HIS MANAGEMENT PIECE. AS IDENTIFIED BY THE COUNTIES THAT WE'RE WE'RE LEVERAGING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WE ALSO WORKING WITH BRILLIANT CORNERS THAT THAT IS. LOOKING AT QUIRK COORDINATING THESE HOUSING EFFORTS FROM THAT PROPERTY RELATED TENDENCY SERVICES PERSPECTIVE. SCORING LA RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL DEVELOPERS FOR FASHION FOR MATCHING FUNDS AND THEN FINALLY. WE HAVE A IMPLEMENTED AIRS ALISON FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL THAT WERE HOPEFUL OVER TIME WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW US FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE LEVERAGE OUR DOLLARS BUT WILL ALSO ALLOW PARTNERS TO CONTRIBUTE. TO A REGIONAL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. SO THAT IS. AREA HEALTH. LET ME JUST UPON WHAT YOU JUST LAID OUT THIS. TEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT YOU'RE DOING TO BASICALLY RUN THE PILOT AND PROVE THAT IT'S FAR CHEAPER TO. TO PUT A ROOF OVER SOMEONE'S HEAD WAS SUPPORT HOUSING MEANT TO. ONE EL ON THE STREETS I IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WITH. IN THE AFTERMATH OF AB SEVENTY FOUR DO YOU RECEIVE. MEDICARE WHOLE PERSON CARE FUNDS SHOULD THOSE FUNDS GO TO THE COUNTIES. SO CONSIGNA YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN SPEAK TO TO. TO THOSE BUT THAT MANAGE SCHEMATIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE PARTNER WITH THE COUNTIES ON THOSE BUT. ARE NOT DIRECT RECIPIENTS OF THOSE FUNDS BUT WHAT I'M WONDERING THIS MAYBE AT ANOTHER CONVERSATION SEPARATE THEM. THIS HEARING BUT THERE THERE MAY BE SOME STATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO YOU COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THROUGH OUR AB SEVEN FOUR PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS LOOKING FOR. A NUMBER JURISDICTIONS ARE WILLING TO DO EXACTLY THESE TYPES OF EYELIDS EIGHT HOUSES SO I IS JUST OFF THE GUIDES SEEMS LIKE THAT. IS A WORTHY CONVERSATION THE OTHER THING I. WANT TOASK IS WHY DID YOUR HEALTH PLAN DECIDE TO DO THIS. ARE OTHERS CONSIDERING THIS WERE OUT OF HOW DID. WHAT WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION PART OF WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AN OBVIOUS THING BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE? SURE NO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO. SO WHY ARE HEALTH PLAN. IS REALLY WHEN WE STARTED TO DO THAT LOOK UPSTREAM AT WHAT IS IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OUR MEMBERS THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE AND LIKE I'LL GIVE YOU THE LETTER TO SUPPORT IT BUT IT'S REALLY OUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE I THINK THAT DROVE US. WE ARE NOT ONLY HEALTH PLAN DOING THIS ACTUALLY ON THEIR SEVERAL PUBLIC PLANS. LIKE OURSELVES. IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE DOING DIFFERENT APPROACHES. OF SAN MATEO HEALTH PLAN ACTUALLY SPEARHEADED THE LONG TERM CARE. EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE THE WE'RE ACTUALLY USING A LOT OF BEST PRACTICE FROM THAT IN HOURS. I CAME FROM LA COUNTY OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AGENCY THERE AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF OUR MODELING AROUND. THE. THAT THE HIGH USE POPULATION CAME FROM SO. THEIR PLANS THERE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE COUNTIES OF THAT THE COUNTY CAN HAVE A FOUGHT A ROBUST FLEXIBLE HOUSING COOL TO BE ABLE TO IT'S A SERVE SO. THERE ARE DEFINITELY ORANGE COUNTY IS DOING HEALTH PLAN IS DOING ON A LOT OF RECOUP PART OF CARE AND OTHER SMALLER PROJECTS. SO THERE IT'S IT'S AN INTEREST OF THE HEALTH PLANS AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPERATIVE. FOR US TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THE HEALTH OF YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES. WELL THANK YOU AND IF YOU ED. THANK AND A BASIC ASKING YOU CIVIC CENTER LURCHER INFORMATION IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND HIGHER SPENDING THAT. MONEY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT ARE WORKING ON ABC REPORTER STEVE THAT'S A PORT AND HAVE THE SITUATION. THEY HAVE SUCH A ONE THING THAT I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT I WANTED TO MENTION EARLY AND I LIKE TO SEE SIMONE LEGAL TO DO THAT GOING BACK TO THE HOMELESSNESS AND WOMEN HOMELESS WOMEN HERE. IS THAT THE ONE OF FOUR THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT AND THAT'S INITIATIVE HERE IT'S THE IT'S THE COUNTY HAS TAKEN A NINE AND IT'S THE FIRST SUCH INITIATIVE IN THE COUNTRY. AND I WANTED TO DRIVE THAT POINT HOME FOR THE SAKE OF BASEL SAYING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP YOU INFORMED. AS TO THE GAS HOW THIS INITIATIVE IS DEVELOPING. IT IS THE FIRST ONE. I I I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY ALL THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES I READ ABOUT THAT STE. SO I'M VERY GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU WHICH IS AB AND A COMMENT. THIS YEAR. FORTUNATELY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND I. ARE ARE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING PART IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WE HAVE ACTUALLY A BIT OF A HEALTHY SURPLUS THIS YEAR SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND. A NUMBER OF US HAVE PROPOSED THAT A QUARTER OF THAT SURPLUS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BE DEVOTED THIS YEAR TO HOMELESS SERVICES ARE STATE. NOW I THINK ACAPELLA COUNTED DOZEN OF US OUT OF EIGHTY SO FAR WHO WERE KIND OF ON BOARD OF THAT BUT WE'RE TRYING TO GROW OUR NUMBERS AND. MY GUESS IS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WOULD SUPPORT THAT. THERE IS A DISCUSSION GOING ON ABOUT WHETHER IT'S WHETHER WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS. VERSES RENTAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT OF HOUSE AND. CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. YES DIDN'T GLANCE ONE QUESTION TWO IS THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO STEP HIGH TO THE ELEVEN SITTINGS. I CHECKED IS THAT TIED TO THE ELEVEN CITIES THAT IS ELEVEN CITIES PROPOSAL BECAUSE BUT THAT'S NOT WHY AMBER TO DO YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF. RIGHT NOW I AM AWARE OF THAT. SO SO THE ELEVEN I I WANT TO THE INTERVIEW YET NO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. SO IT'S INTERESTING. THAT THE BIG THIRTEEN MAYORS OF CALIFORNIA HAD PROPOSED THAT AND CERTAINLY THE QUESTION IS COMING FROM OTHER PARTS YOU DON'T REPRESENT THOSE THIRTEEN CITIES HOW DO WE GET SOME OF US MONEY AND THAT. THE IDEA HAS BEEN IF A JURISDICTION HAS SKIN IN THE GAME IF THEY'RE WILLING TO. COUNTY OR CITY IS KIND OF A SOME DOLLARS THAT THERE BE A MATCHING. SIMILAR THAT'S OR TALK ABOUT BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HOMELESSNESS HAS A FACE EVERYWHERE AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A TRUE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AT ONCE HE ALTERS SIX. WHAT IT IN ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTION THOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT? WANTED PERMITTED SUPPORT OF HOUSING YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DEAL. WITH CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. UNLESS IF WE HAVE THE PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THERE THE JURY'S OUT ON THAT THAT IS THE ONLY APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION THAT WORKED FOR THE CHRONICLE WAS. POPULATION AND I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE EMPHASIS ON PERMITS PART OF HOUSING BECAUSE OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU KNOW AND I'M HOW THAT'S GOING TO. YOU KNOW AND HOMELESSNESS THAT OFTEN IS AN UNATTENDED. HALF TRUTHS BECAUSE IT LEAVES CHRONIC. HOMELESS OUT OF THE EQUATION IT AFFORDABLE HA PERMITS WERE TO HOUSING IS PART OF. A BOMB AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT AS YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES AND ALL THAT. SO THE CHOICE THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT. DO WE MOODY'S. YOU KNOW THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION HOMELESS POPULATION LIKE HERE IN THE COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE OUT ON THE STREETS WHERE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. ARE BY CHOOSING RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS BECAUSE RAPID RE HOUSING DOLLARS. OFTEN IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION. FOR THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE PROVIDING. RAPIDLY HOUSING FOR THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS OR EVEN UP TO THE TOTAL OF TWO YEARS SAID IT'S OFTEN ALLOW FOR. THEN WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF THAT YOU KNOW THE WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS IS A PERMANENT DISABILITY THEIR UNEMPLOYABLE. DO THEY FALL OUT OF HOUSING AT THAT POINT TIME THAT BEING SAID ON THE RAPIDLY HOUSING SIDE WITHOUT OVERSIMPLIFYING IT SO MUCH. IS THAT RAPIDLY HOUSING WOULD HELP GET OUR. NON CHRONICALLY HOMES PERKED UP POPULATION OFF THE STREETS AND HERE IN THE COUNTY. TAKES ON THE RESPONSIBILITY DURING THE HOMELESS COUNTY ASK A COUPLE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN. DID YOU FIRST BECOME HOMELESS DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. AND THAT'S BEEN NO THAT'S ALSO BEEN A ONE IN FOUR NUMBER. THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT NEED TO RAPIDLY HOUSING THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR SO NEED. THE PERMITTED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I WOULD SAY. THAT THERE'S MORE RESOURCES TO GET. THOSE WERE NOT QUAN ACOSTA ST STE NOT ENOUGH BUT THERE'S MORE COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING WE NEED OUR. THE FUNDING. THE GOING TO PERMIT A SPORT THOUSAND. VERY HEALTH POINT SIR THANK YOU. NUMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH I I AM SO PLEASED WITH. THE THREE OF YOU AND EVERY OTHER. PANELISTS WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY TO THE RIGHT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION BECAUSE I DO WANT THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE TO. UNDERSTAND SAN BERNARDINO IN A WAY THAT I COULD NEVER DESCRIBE TO HIM.

MANY OF OUR OLDER BUILDINGS AT RISK OF DAMAGE EVEN MAJOR EARTHQUAKE ARE HOME TO THE LOWER MIDDLE INCOME RESIDENTS OF OUR. COMMUNITIES.

ASSEMBLY WOMAN GOMEZ REYES HAS ALREADY AUTHORED BY THE SIGNED ON AS A CO AUTHOR THANKS ALONG WITH I THINK ALMOST A CO AUTHORS OF THAT THE ACT THINGS ARE VERY MUCH. ALMOST EVERY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND WE KNOW COUNTY HAS SIGNED ON AS A CO AUTHOR SOME PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT MIGHT GET PAST. BUT THAT'S CREATES THE OFFICE OF HOMELESS YOUTH THAT SACRAMENTO AND IT ALSO CREATES SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WILL GO TO HELP SERVE HOMELESS YOU THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.
