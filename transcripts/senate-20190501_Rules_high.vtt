GENERAL I WOULD SAY THE ONE OF

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.936
THE FEW MEETINGS I'VE HAD THE

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.904
PLEASURE OF ATTENDING WE RECEIVE

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.606
THE S. B. ONE FIFTY REPORT --

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:34.774
WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVELY

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.843
REQUIRED REPORT FOR CARD TO

SUCCESS IN IN MEETING THE SB

THIRTY TWO GOALS FOR A 40%

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.816
REDUCTION BELOW NINETEEN NINETY

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:44.851
LEVELS.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.285
BY TWENTY THIRTY AND REALITIES

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.787
WERE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.456
GOALS -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WELL

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.859
I'M SORRY WE ARE NOT ON TRACK --

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.060
TO MEET OUR GOALS AND IN FACT ON

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.562
THE SITUATION IS GTTING WORSE.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.997
INSTEAD OF BETTER AND THAT'S

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.599
THAT'S PRIMARILY IN LARGE PART

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.367
DUE. TO THE EVER INCREASING

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.236
NUMBER OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.637
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.472
BUT I DO THINK IN THE LA -- HOW

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.141
TO ADD A PRETTY EXHAUSTIVE

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.876
REPORT ON THIS AND AND DECEMBER --

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:12.378
THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.446
TO ENSURE.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.181
THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.017
PUT IN PLACE ARE EFFECTIVE.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.952
ARE COST EFFECTIVE ARE ACTUALLY

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.821
ACHIEVING MEASURABLE GOALS AND

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:22.922
IF THEY'RE NOT THEN WE NEED TO

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.457
COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.592
SAY THIS PROGRAM WAS PUT IN

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.226
PLACE WE DON'T THINK THAT IT'S

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.027
WORKING.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:28.961
HI THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THAT

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.229
THERE ARE THERE'S THERE'S

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.931
POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND SO.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.599
I THINK THAT THE THE NATURE OF A

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.435
OF A PROGRAM BY ITSELF HAS NO

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.637
PURPOSE IT'S ONLY IN ITS

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.938
EFFECTIVENESS -- TO LOWER

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.306
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LOWER

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.207
AIR POLLUTION AND SO.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.742
I THINK EVERY PROGRAM MUST BE

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.912
CONSTANTLY MONITORED AND%

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.380
EVALUATED -- AND IF THERE'S ONE

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.314
THAT'S WORKING EXPERT JUST FOR

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.449
THE PROGRAM'S WORKING DOESN'T

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.683
MEAN THAT'S THE BEST ALLOCATION

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.751
RESOURCES THERE COULD BE ANOTHER

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:53.386
ONE THAT'S WORKING BETTER WE

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.854
SHOULD DO MORE OF THAT -- ONE

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.389
BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF MEDIAN

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.957
THAT THE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.258
GOALS WE'RE GONNA.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.794
HAVE TO BE INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.264
AND INCREDIBLY ACCOUNTABLE -- TO

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:05.865
ACHIEVE THE ENDS THAT THAT WE

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:06.566
SICK.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.200

CHANCE TO TEND TO HAVE A

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:29.422

OF MY FRUSTRATIONS AND I'M

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.129

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.597
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.766
NOW YOU CAN HAVE THIS ROLE.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.502
IS -- HOW COLLABORATIVE WE ALL

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.004
BE BETWEEN THAT THE AGENCY AND

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.706
IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE'VE

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:49.075
SEATED A LOT OF POWER AND

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:53.546
AUTHORITY? TO THE BOARD AND SO

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:55.081
I'M JUST I'M JUST CURIOUS.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.749
ARE YOU SEE THOSE DYNAMICS

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.651
WORKING WELL HAVING HAVING SAT

00:06:58.718 --> 00:06:59.852
IN A LEGISLATIVE BODY NOT IN THE

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.420
SENATE -- IN IN THE LOWER HOUSE --

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.390
IN IN THE ASSEMBLY THANKS FOR

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.260
SAYING NO.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.594
I KNOW WHICH HOUSE AMEND -- YOU

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:10.730
GET SHOT YOUR DIGITAL YOU GET

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:11.063
ALL THIS IS.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.165
THE I WOULD JUST SAY HE'S GOING

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:15.735
TO GET IN TROUBLE COLLEAGUES BE

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:19.438
CAREFUL THE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.541
BUT THE HAVING HAVING SAT THERE

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.108
I MEAN LEGISLATIVE BODIES BY

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.176
THEIR VERY NATURE VERY

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.076
RESPONSIVE TO THE PUBLIC --

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.444
BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.179
ESSENTIALLY YOUR EXISTENCE.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.013
AND WHEN LEGISLATIVE BODIES SET

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:27.980
A GOAL AND GREATER REGULATORY

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.682
ENTITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL THAT

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:30.983
REGULATORY ENTITY BY ITS NATURE

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.285
IS NOT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IT

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.786
DERIVES ITS POWER FROM FROM THE

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:34.654
LEGISLATURE.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.055
AND AND I THINK IT'S VITALLY

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.657
IMPORTANT THAT REGULATORY

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.691
ENTITIES.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.426
REALLY UNDERSTAND DEEPLY THAT

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.128
THAT THEY THEY HAVE NO POWER

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:44.530
OTHER THAN THAT GRANTED TO THEM

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.165
BY THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SO

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:47.266
THAT THE CONSTANT IN GAUGE MEN

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.701
AND INTERACTION WITH THE

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.570
LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.672
QUESTIONS TO RESPOND INCREASE TO

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.440
RESPOND TO SUGGESTIONS -- I

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:55.308
THINK IS A VITAL PART AND I

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.410
THINK I THINK INCREASING THAT

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.412
THAT BOND IN THAT RELATIONSHIP.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.180
OCT CAN CAN A SERVE TO TO ENSURE

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.082
THE TRUST OF THE THE ENTITY THAT

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.383
CREATED IT.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.818
BUT ALSO TO TO GENERAL'S POINT.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.720
CAN CONSERVE TO TO TO BUILD SOME

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.355
TRUST SO THAT IF IF IF THERE BE

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:10.590
WERE TO COME BACK AND SAY THIS

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.557
PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH THE

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.758
BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT PERHAPS

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.193
IT SHOULD CHANGE.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.428
THEN WE HAVE THAT COULD WELL IN

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.963
THAT TRUST GO FORWARD -- AND I

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.264
ALSO THINK I ALSO THINK AND THIS

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.398
IS SOMETHING.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.867
I THINK FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.769
KIND OF FOREIGN -- BUT THE AB

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.403
SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM I BELIEVE

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.304
IS A VERY GOOD PROGRAM.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.439
I THINK THAT WAS GOOD

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.207
LEGISLATION I THINK THAT IT IS

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.076
DRIVING IN THE AIR RESOURCES

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.411
BOARD TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.747
THE AIR DISTRICTS -- IN IN THE

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.048
IN THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.084
COMMUNITIES AND TO REALLY WORK

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.485
CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY --

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.220
AND TO HEAR ABOUT CONCERNS IN A

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.656
PRIORITIZE FUNDING. FOR PROGRAMS

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.091
IN COMMUNITIES MOST MPACTED AND

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.325
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A A

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:49.228
MINDSET SHIFT THAT IS A POSITIVE.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.930
ONE A MAN IF A MEMBER OF THE AIR

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.632
RESOURCES BOARD I WILL BE

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:53.933
RESPONSIVE PERSON HAVING.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.601
SAT IN THAT SEAT IN ENSURING

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.036
THAT THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.704
HAVE GREAT THANK YOU.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.438
ABOUT.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:00.706
SO ONE OF THE QUESTION I HAVE

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:01.908
I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW WHERE YOU

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.843
KIND OF THINK THE SWEET SPOT IS

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.443
SO I'M I'VE GOT WORKING CLASS

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.645
DISTRICT.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.214
AND I HAVE A TINY COMMUTERS AND

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.048
THEY DON'T WANT TO COMMUTE UT

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:10.883
THEIR FORCES COMMITTEES I GOTTA

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.517
FIFTY THOUSAND COME OUT CENTER

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:18.658
CREE BALLY HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.927
DAY COMING OUT OF ANIL FAMILY

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.228
ABOUT EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND COME

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:22.995
OUT THE VICTOR VALLEY.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:23.763
SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BOUNCE

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:24.664
BETWEEN.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.965
ECONOMIC YOU KNOW REGULATIONS

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.400
AND AND ECONOMIC ITALITY WHERE

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.768
TO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:29.568
YOU BALANCE THAT WATER I DON'T

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:30.136
THINK THE TWO ARE MUTUALLY

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:30.970
EXCLUSIVE YOU KNOW WE WE CREATED

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:31.570
MORE JOBS.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.339
IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY -- YOU

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.408
KNOW LAST YEAR THAN THAN AN

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:36.876
OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY --

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.144
AND SO I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.978
THAT THE TO THEIR THEIR IS

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:41.213
INHERENTLY AT TIMES THE ROB --

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.349
BETWEEN THE TWO BUT I THINK I

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.850
THINK PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.319
TO TRANSPORTATION -- WHEN YOU

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.787
REALLY ANALYZE THE CONCEPT OF OF

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.088
INDUCED DEMAND AND YOU LOOK AT

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.257
EXAMPLES OF OF HOW DO YOU

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.591
ACTUALLY LOWER CONGESTION --

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.327
WHICH HAS THE BENEFIT OF HELPING

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.795
FOLKS.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.463
WHO ARE WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.565
WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HAS THE

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.533
BENEFIT OF OF LOWER IN OUR

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.201
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.502
CARBON EMISSIONS?

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.004
OUR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS I'M

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.173
REALLY TRYING TO REALIGN SOME OF

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.607
THAT THINKING -- BEHIND A

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.542
GREATER INVESTMENT IN TRANSIT

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:10.710
AND I I THINK THAT THAT'S VITAL

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.511
I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN WE CAN

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:14.280
BUILD FREEWAYS TO TO GET HERSELF

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.348
OUT OF THIS PROBLEM.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.183
A AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO A

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.884
REAL LINE AND IN ONE OF THE MOST

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:19.885
TROUBLING ASPECTS OF A RECENT

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:20.386
REPORT.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.954
WAS IN LAST TEN YEARS WE REALLY

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.222
HAVEN'T SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.757
STRUCTURE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.927
FUNDING -- AND SO WE WONDER WHY

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.561
THE EMPTIES AND CONGESTION KEEP

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:30.062
GOING UP AND SO I THIK THAT'S

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.098
NOW THAT THAT'S NOT INHERENTLY A

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.200
ROLL OF CARB -- BUT WE ARE

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:35.334
DEPENDENT UPON OUR NPOS OUGHT TO

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.603
MEET THE SB THREE SEVEN FIVE

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.171
GOALS -- AND A LOT OF THEM ARE

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:40.339
NOT IN AND SO I THINK WE'RE

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.375
GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:43.876
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING --

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.177
AND WE HAVE THESE KIND OF

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:47.113
COMPETING IN CONFLICTING GOALS.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.047
AND SO ONE THING WHEN YOU

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.215
MENTION COLLABORATION THAT I

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.449
THINK IS VITAL.

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.550
AS AN ENTITY LIKE THE AIR

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:54.553
RESOURCES BOARD -- THE CTC HI

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.088
THE ENERGY COMMISSION HI YOU

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:56.889
KNOW THESE ENTITIES HAVE TO

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.492
BETTER START ALIGNING THEMSELVES --

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.260
AND WORK WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.029
JURISDICTIONS ULTIMATELY HAVE

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.030
THE LAND USE AUTHORITY -- TO TRY

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:04.997
AND GET US IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.133
STRATEGIC SENSE SO WE CAN WE CAN

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:08.401
ACHIEVE THE GOALS WE HAVE ON

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.636
CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY.

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.238
OF LOSS OF IN MIND FOR THE THE

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.040
IMPACT ON FAMILIES RIGHT THANK

THAT IN OUR OFFICE DISCUSSION.

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:42.201
THAT YOU HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.602
THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE ROLE IN

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.971
TERMS OF THE REGULATORY

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.373

IMPLEMENTED.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:52.878
CAN HAVING THE GOALS AND

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:56.816
OBJECTIVES ARE QUANTIFIED AND

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:59.618
REVIEWED ON WITH SAND ON SENATOR

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.987
ROSS QUESTION WAS ONE OF MINE

AND YOU'VE ANSWERED THAT ARE.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.090
REALLY IN MORE DEPTH THAN WE

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:05.658
WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED SO YOU

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.359
HAVE A GREAT GRASP AND HAVEN'T

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:09.261
BEEN THERE THAT LONG SO I THINK

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:10.096
YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.064
I DO HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING

CAP AND TRADE AND WE DID TALK A

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.701
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.002
BECAUSE IT WAS SIGNED NOT

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.904

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.040

TRADE AS COMPARED TO REGULATIONS

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:27.947

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:29.882
IN TERMS OF CAP AND TRADE BEING

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:31.784
A MORE PREFERRED METHOD YOU

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:32.685
SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT WITH

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:33.853
THE FIRE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.387
IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATION.

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.490
RIGHT OUT SO YOU KNOW WE NEED IN

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.757
TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.392
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:41.827
WELL IN THIS THIS THIS BODY AT A

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:45.531
AT A ROBUST DEBATE -- I SURE TO

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.966
SENATOR BATES AND AND ARMENIAN I

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.734
KNOW THAT THERE'S A A SEGMENT OF

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.070
OF OLKS WHO WHO DON'T LIKE CAP

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.104
AND TRADE -- AND THERE'S A

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.873
SECOND FOLKS -- ON THE OTHER

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:55.574
SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM HOSPITAL I

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.210
CAPTURED -- FOR DIFFERENT

00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:58.811
REASONS THAT HAPPENED HAPPENED

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.446
TO ALIGN -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:01.647
BODY CAME UP WITH THAT AND I I

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:02.281
BELIEVE THE CAP AND TRADE IS A

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:03.816
PIECE.

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:05.651
OF THE TOTALITY OF HOW WE

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:06.652
ACHIEVE OUR GOALS I DON'T

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:07.953
BELIEVE THAT BE A CAP AND TRADE

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.687
ALONE.

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.656
A WE CAN GET WHERE WHERE WE NEED

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:12.091
TO BE -- BUT THE NOTION THAT

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.426
THAT WE CAN CAN SET TARGETS FOR

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.562
THE THE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:25.738
FIFTY ENTITIES THAT PRODUCE

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:28.107
ABOUT 85% OF OF THE EMISSIONS --

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:29.675
AND AND THROUGH -- A COMBINATION

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:30.843
OF ALLOWANCES A AND A MARKET

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.011
BASED SYSTEM -- AND THEN THROUGH

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:33.012
THE POTENTIAL FOR OFFSETS --

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:33.712
WHICH ARE TWO DIFFERENT

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:34.513
COMPONENTS OF OF THE CAP AND

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.581
TRADE SYSTEM.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.482
ON THAT WE CAN GET ON THE

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.149
TRAJECTORY WE HAD OUR OUR TWENTY

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.151
THIRTY GOALS IN A WAY THAT

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:39.618
PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:40.853
I TO INDUSTRY SO THAT THEY CAN

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.420
CONTINUE. TO BE AN ECONOMIC

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.988
ENGINE WHICH WHICH IS ALSO ALSO

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.657
IMPORTANT TO US -- I THINK AS WE

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.791
MONITORING WE TRACK THAT

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.126
CAPTURED PROGRAM GOING FORWARD

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.093
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS WE HAVE

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.162
TO BE MINDFUL OF ONE IS THAT

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:50.763
WHAT IS THE IMPACT.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:51.630
BOTH PLACE.

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.831
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON CARBON

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.166
EMISSIONS AND WHAT IS THE IMPACT

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.801
ON THE ECONOMY -- THERE'S BEEN

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.903
SOME CRITICISM -- THAT FOR SOME

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.538
OF THE INDUSTRY'S WERE WE FEAR --

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.907
LEAKAGE OR A POTENTIAL MOVING TO

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.176
THE FREE ALLOWANCES ARE PERHAPS

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.411
TOO GENEROUS -- AND THAT'S AN

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.079
ISSUE AGAIN FINDING THAT BALANCE

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.147
THAT YOU HAVE TO STRIKE.

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.649
ON THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERNED --

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:11.917
EXPRESS NEARLY A REPORT AND

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:13.886
OTHERS OF THE POTENTIAL OF

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.955
BANKING IN -- ALLOWANCES AT A

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.289
POINT WHERE THEY'RE AT A LOWER

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.891
PRICE POINT TO POTENTIALLY CASH

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.392
THEM IN AND OUT YEARS WHERE IT

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.860
WOULD APPEAR THAT WERE MEETING

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:22.962
GOALS WERE NOT ACTUALLY MEETING --

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.464
AND THAT AGAIN JUST COMES BACK --

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.366
TO APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:28.934
APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATION ON

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.569
AND ENSURING THAT THAT WE'RE

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:31.103
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.072
HAPPENING -- AND MINDFUL SO THAT

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:37.977
WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE BOTH OF

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.345
THOSE GOALS.

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.312

WHAT THEY CAN AS WELL --

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:55.481
INCIDENT COMES UNDER THE ANTIS

IN.

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:57.649
YOU KNOW I I THINK IS A REGION

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:58.250
IN THIS IS NOT.

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.118
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED -- AS A

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:03.055
AS A AS AN ENTITY CARB.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.256
THE CARD HAS NO LAND USE OR

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.058
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND SO

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.960
THIS IS WHERE THERE REALLY HAS

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:09.762
TO BE THAT COLLABORATION --

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:12.131
BETWEEN -- OUR OUR REGIONAL

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.000
PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS ARE NPOS

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.101
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:17.703
IN BETWEEN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.405
SO THAT WE CAN TRY AND ALIGN AS

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:20.639
BEST WE CAN THAT THE DUAL

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.808
CHALLENGES OF YOU KNOW IF WE

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.709
HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WHICH

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.844
I I BELIEVE MOST OF US BELIEVE

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:28.680
WE DO -- AND WE HAVE TO ALSO NOT

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:31.383
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.818
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:33.886
AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A A

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.921
RETHINKING OF OF OF OUR

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.456
PRIORITIES A AND R. ALIGNMENT

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.824
AND THE AND THE CHALLENGES IN

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.959
FRONT OF US -- AND THAT IS GOING

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.227
TO REALLY GET DOWN TO THE TO THE

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.863
CRUX OF OF THAT COLLABORATIVE

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.832
ISSUE -- BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.967
KNOW WE HAD A AN ISSUE.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:51.136
SAN DIEGO JUST YESTERDAY WHERE

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.572
ARE -- MPO STAND ACT I HAD A

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.274
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.974
THAT THE COURTS RULED WAS

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.811
INCONSISTENT WITH SB THREE

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.345
SEVENTY FIVE GOALS.

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.147
AND THEY CAME OUT AND REVISE

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.649
THAT PLAN AND PUTTING IT FORWARD

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:04.550
TO INVESTIGATE SECONDLY MORE IN

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.351
TRANSIT MOVING FORWARD -- BUT

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.486
THAT'S IT'S A IT'S A TENSION IN

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.022
THE IT'S A ROB AND AND THAT IS

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.190
BY THINK LAYING OUT THROUGHOUT

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.225
ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS AS WE TRY

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.259
AND TRYING TO LINE THESE THINGS.

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.294
AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.495
CARP IS GOING TO HAVE TO

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.330
CONFRONT THE REALITIES OF OF THE

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:20.232
CARS THAT ARE PUT ON THE ROAD.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.000
BY LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS UP

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:22.901
PERHAPS WITH WITH GREATER

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.604
COLLABORATION AT A RECENT CAR

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.473
MEETING -- WE SPENT A

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.140
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME ON A

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.242
ON A FREIGHTER WAREHOUSE

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.010
HANDBOOK A AS YOU SEE AN ECONOMY

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.512
THIS CHANGING FROM MORE BRICK

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.547
AND MORTAR RETAIL -- TO MORE

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.882
DELIVERY BUT FOLKS WANT THAT

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.117
DELIVERY NOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.586
SOMETHING SHIPPED HIM IN THREE

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:41.453
DAYS THEY WANTED TOMORROW WELL

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.055
THAT'S PUSHING WAREHOUSES AND

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:43.956
OTHER AREAS AND WE'RE TRYING TO

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.023
TALK THINK ABOUT.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.425
HOW WE CAN MAKE SUGGESTIONS OR

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.659
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WORK

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.127
COLLABORATIVELY WITH LOCAL

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:49.728
GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE THOSE

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.597
GOALS -- ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:52.898
A PROMISE.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.366
OF OF LOWERING OBVIOUSLY THERE

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.801
THERE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AS

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:58.770
LONG AS THE ENERGY THAT CHARGES

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.005
THEM AS IS CLEAN -- BUT IN SAN

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:05.511
DIEGO WE HAVE THREE MILLION

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:06.512
REGISTERED VEHICLES.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:07.145
WE HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:08.146
CARS.

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:08.747
SO WE COULD HAVE A TEN FOLD

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.848
INCREASE AND STILL BE UNDER 10%

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:10.949
OF THE TOTAL ON THERE SOME GREAT

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:11.884
SOCIETAL EQUITY ISSUES.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.886
AROUND ELECTRIC CARS AUTONOMOUS

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.020
VEHICLES GET TALKED ABOUT A LOT

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.722
AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HAVE

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.056
SOME POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.958
THEY'RE ZERO EMISSION BUT A A

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:21.293
STUDY ON THE UC DAVIS SO THAT

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.060
AUTONOMOUS CARS.

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.530
INCREASE USAGE BY 80% BECAUSE IF

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:26.698
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY DRIVE

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:27.299
IT AND PARK IT MOVE IT YOU USE

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.935
IT MORE -- AND SO I THINK THOSE

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:30.569
ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE REALLY

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:31.837
MINDFUL OF AN AND I'LL JUST SAY

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:32.838
ONE THING.

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.306
ON THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.742
THAT IS SO VITALLY IMPORANT.

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.577
IS THE FEDERAL ROLL BACKS THAT

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:40.012
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND THESE ARE

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.246
GONNA HAVE DEVASTATING

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:42.514
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE OF

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.050
CALIFORNIA HEY WE AS A STATE

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:45.817
ADOPTED.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:47.386
WE ARE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:48.487
FOR THE FUEL BECAUSE IN THE CAR

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:49.454
BUT WE ADOPTED EMISSION

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.989
STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUAL

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:54.660
OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE -- AND

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.128
THE MILES PER GALLON.

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:57.262
OUR EMISSIONS STANDARDS THE

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.163
ABILITY TO DO THOSE WAS A WAIVER.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.731
UNDER SECTION ONE SEVENTY SEVEN

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:00.132
THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:02.501
AND OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:03.635
ARE STANDARD TO THE POINT WHERE

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.938
WE'RE NEARING 40% OF THE CARS IN

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.506
THE COUNTRY OR ON OUR STANDARD.

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:08.774
AND WE WORKED OUT WITH THE OBAMA

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.742
ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD BECOME

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:11.310
THE FEDERAL STANDARD MOVING

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.278
FORWARD -- AND THE CURRENT

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.213
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.215
ROLLING OUT BACK NOW THE AUTO

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.517
INDUSTRY AS A SUPPORT ROLE IN

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.719
THE BACK -- CERTAINLY THE STATES

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.553
THAT HAVE A DON'T SUPPORT ROLE

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:21.920
IN THAT BACK.

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.755
IN THE IMPACT OF THE ROLL BACK

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:25.791
IRONICALLY WOULD LOWER MILES PER

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.392
GALLON WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:28.560
COST TO CONSUMERS THEY WOULD

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.562
HAVE TO PUT MORE GAS IN THERE

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:31.330
LESS EFFICIENT CARS TO GONNA

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.231
MAKE TAXPAYERS PAY MORE -- BUT

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:34.633
IT ALSO WOULD PUT FIFTEEN

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.234
MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.235
BACK HERE IT'S TWO POINT NINE

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.537
CARS AND SO.

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:39.771
FIGHTING THOSE AND EFFORTS LIKE

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.940
SB ONE I THINK OR OF VITAL PART

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.676
OF HAVING ANY CHANCE. TO ACHIEVE

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.410
THAT THE GOALS HAVE BEEN

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:47.446
OUTLINED IN AS YOU POINT OUT ITS

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:50.749
MULTI FACTORIAL -- PROXIMITY OF

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.150
FOUR PEOPLE WORK BY WHERE THEY

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:57.389
HAVE TO DRIVE FOR WORK -- OUR

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.024
HABITS OF PERSONAL FREEDOM AND

00:20:59.091 --> 00:20:59.825
MOBILITY IN OUR OWN CARS

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.159
CHARGING STATIONS WE TALKED

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:03.228
ABOUT.

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:05.597
I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES.

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:08.300
WHERE THE AIR QUALITY WAS WORSE

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:10.435
THAN IT IS TODAY WITH MORE

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:12.004
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD?

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.672
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF CLEAN AIR

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:16.208
STANDARDS CATALYTIC CONVERTERS

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:18.510
GETTING RID OF LEADED GAS ALL OF

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.779
THAT WAS GOVERNMENT.

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:23.649
PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES NOT

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:26.885
INDUSTRY VOLUNTEERISM AND SO WE

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.387
DO HAVE.

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.922
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND IN WE DO

THAT YOU ARE -- WE TALKED A

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.169
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IF I MIGHT.

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:54.172
OF GO ON WITH SENATOR THE MONEY

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:55.506
HAD TO SAY ABOUT EDUCATION BUT

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:56.274
MINE FOCUSES ON I THINK OUR

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.543
DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON EDUCATION

00:32:58.609 --> 00:33:00.445
FOR THE LICENSEES ESPECIALLY THE

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.312
SMALLER.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.448
MOM AND POP TYPE BUSINESSES THAT

00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:05.450
MIGHT MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:07.185
HONEST MISTAKES BECAUSE THEY

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.854
DIDN'T KNOW -- AND WE TALKED TO

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:12.023
A IN DEPTH ABOUT THAT SO MY

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.725
QUESTION IS -- FOLLOWS UP FROM

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.393
OUR DISCUSSION FOCUSING ON

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.829
EDUCATION OF THE LICENSEES AND

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.864
HOW YOU MIGHT.

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.532
INCREASE AND EXPAND OUT WHERE

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:24.202
YOU SEE A TREND OF THE I DON'T

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:25.837
KNOW SIR I DIDN'T KNOW AND I WAS

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:26.938
THE REASON AND THEY'RE NOT

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.773
ALLOWED TO NOT KNOW BECAUSE THEY

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.007
GOT THEIR LICENSE THEY SHOULD.

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.376
BUT I DO THINK THERE CAN BE A

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:32.877
GAP THERE AND WE SHOULD WE

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.846
DISCUSS THAT SO YOUR APPROACH TO

00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:36.681
THEY ARE GOING FORWARD DO WE

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.783
HAVE A A PLAN WE MIGHT REQUIRE.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.618
A LITTLE MORE EDUCATION BEFORE

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.686
THEY GET THE LICENSEWOULD THAT

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.254
BE SOMETHING THAT.

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:45.790
IS DOABLE.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.058
THANK YOU SENATOR ON THAT IS

00:33:47.125 --> 00:34:03.074
THAT WOULD BE UNDER THE

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:04.208
DEPARTMENTS JURISDICTION

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:05.343
SPECIFICALLY HOWEVER I AM AWARE

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.677
THAT THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:07.278
PROGRAMS THAT.

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.446
ARE SEEM VERY ROBUST ONE IS THE

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.213
RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.181
PROGRAM AND THE OTHER IS CALLED

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.482
A LEAD PROGRAM FOR LICENSEES

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:17.255
THAT'S FREE AND VOLUNTARY SO I

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:20.792
DON'T THE NEW.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:22.160
YOU KNOW THE HORIZONTAL VERSUS

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:24.662
VERTICAL OR THE RED STRIPES ON

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.431
THE CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE.

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.966
AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THAT IS

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:31.235
OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION TO

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:32.703
IMPLEMENT NEW EDUCATIONAL

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.072
PROGRAMS BUT IT CERTAINLY AS WE

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.674
SEE TRENDS AND AS WE SPOKE OF AS

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.177
WE START TO SEE TRENDS IN THE

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.678
APPEALS PROCESS.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:41.579
THAT SOMETHING WE COULD

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.747
POTENTIALLY COLLABORATE WITH THE

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.515
DEPARTMENT AND SAY HEY WE'RE

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:45.917
SEEING MORE OF THIS HOW ARE WE

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:48.386
HANDLING AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:49.687
ALONG THOSE LINES.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.155
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:53.791
WORTHWHILE VERY VALUABLE AS WE

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:54.091
GO FORWARD.

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:56.127
OTHER ON AREA WE TOUCHED ON WAS

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:58.229
THE LENGTH OF THE APPEAL PROCESS

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.697
YES IN IMPROVING NOW BECAUSE BY

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:00.898
AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL THAT'S

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.800
WHAT WE ARE RECEIVE A LOT OF

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.102
COMPLAINTS PEOPLE WAITING FOR A

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.204
DECISION -- AND WE TALKED A

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.339
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.740
BE DONE TO AB SHORTEN OUT.

00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:11.409
YES ABSOLUTELY SO CURRENTLY THE

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.277
PROCESS DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.646
LONGER THAN WE WOULD LIKE -- THE

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.682
ONE BENEFIT TO THAT BEING THAT

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.050
THE LICENSEE.

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.751
DOES HAS A STAY OF THEIR

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.520
SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION AS IT

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:25.089
WERE WHILE IT'S IN THE P. A. B.

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.457
APPEALS PROCESS.

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:29.093
SO -- THEY'RE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.729
CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH THEIR

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:34.365
FULLY OPERATIONAL.

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.534
MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE -- DURING

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.603
THAT PROCESS HOWEVER THERE ARE

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:40.471
SOME AREAS OF A BOTTLE NECK THAT

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:41.806
I THINK THAT WE COULD IMPROVE

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.174
UPON AND WORKING WITH THE

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.009
DEPARTMENT HAS TO DO A TRANSFER

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:47.044
OF DOCUMENTS AND I THINK IT HAS

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:53.117
TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY AND

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:55.119
IMPROVING -- THAT TRANSFER BY

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:55.887
WAY OF DIGITIZING.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:00.391
SPEED UP THE PROCESS.
