RISK THE FOR TWO QUESTIONS ARE

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.897
MORE BY THE FACT THAT UNLIKE

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:53.998
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.566
CAN FUND ECONOMIC STIMULUS

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:58.002
THROUGH DEFICIT SPENDING. ANY

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.504
STATE SPENDING ON AN ACTIVITY

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.038

ON OTHER ACTIVITIES. AND THESE

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.378
ARE SENDING REDUCTIONS CAN MAKE

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.780
IT HARD TO ASSUME THAT ANY

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.648
STATE SPENDING. AIMED AT

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.750
GROWING THE ECONOMY WILL

ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE ITS GOAL.

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.553
FOR THIS REASON THERE IS A HIGH

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.921
NEED FOR THE STATE TO GET THE

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:18.389
BEST BANG FOR ITS BUCK IF YOU

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.991
WILL AND SO TO DO SO WOULD BE

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:21.926
SUGGEST. ASKING A FEW

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:24.829
QUESTIONS- FIRST ASSEMBLY DOES

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.964
THE STATE SPENDING TARGET THE

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:28.132
PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.634
BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.903
PANDEMIC. A MASS WHY WHAT'S THE

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.738
RATIONALE FOR THIS FOCUS OVER

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.240
SAY A FOCUSING ON BOOSTING

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:36.707
CONSERVE MATERIALS AND

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.810
GENERALLY OR- PROMOTING A

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:40.278
CERTAIN- STRATEGICALLY

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.813
IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE OF THE

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.148
STATE LET ME. GIVE YOU A FEW

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:47.618
REASONS- FIRST- MANY WORKERS

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:50.521
AND BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAVE

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:51.355
BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:53.291
HAVE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.993
RESOURCES INTO BUILDING A TRADE

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.829
OR BUSINESS. AND THEY COULD

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.997
FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS- IF

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:01.265
THERE WILL TYPICALLY FORCE TO

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:01.999
TRANSITION INTO A NEW

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:05.603
OCCUPATION OR NEW SECTOR AS A

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.738
RESULT. OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.707
BECAUSE OF THIS- HELPING

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.642
BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKERS WHO

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:12.343
HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY THE

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.345
PANDEMIC RESUME THEIR PRIOR

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:17.381
ROLES MAYBE THE QUICKEST WAY TO

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:17.982
GET THEM BACK TO WORK IN MANY

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:21.285
CASES- SECOND. UNLIKE PAST

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.954
RECESSIONS WHICH REMARK BY A

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.388
MAJOR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS IN THE

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:27.125
ECONOMY THINK- THE AEROSPACE

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:28.659
AND DEFENSE CUTBACKS IN THE

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.795
EARLY NINETIES OR THE REAL

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.230
THING FINANCING TRACTION DURING

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.131
THE GREAT RECESSION. RIGHT NOW

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.900
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.235
THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.904
WILL LEAD TO PERMANENT LONG

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:40.471
TERM CHANGES IN THE STATE'S

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.440
ECONOMY- OR WHETHER THE

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.308
SLOWDOWN HAS BEEN- MORE

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.011
TRANSITORY RESPONSE. TO THE

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:49.313
EMERGENCY OF THE PANDEMIC. THE

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.615
STATE MAY ULTIMATELY SEE

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.116
STRUCTURAL SHIFTS AS A RESULT

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:54.185
OF THE PANDEMIC BUT AT THE

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.487
MOMENT ANY ATTEMPT TO GAUGE

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.456
WHERE THE SHIPS MIGHT OCCUR-

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:02.460
WILL JUST BE GUESSES ARE WITH

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:03.060
LITTLE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT TO

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:06.030
DRAW ON- FINALLY THE DATA WE

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.198
HAVE ON BUSINESS TRENDS DURING

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:09.767
THE PANDEMIC- SUGGESTS THAT NEW

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.002
BUSINESS FORMATION IN

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.737
CALIFORNIA. HAS ACTUALLY

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.238
QUICKLY SNAPPED BACK TO PRE

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.207
PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND IN

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.809
ADDITION WE SEE THAT DURING

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:20.344
TWENTY TWENTY. BUSINESS

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:21.779
FORMATIONS IN CALIFORNIA

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.915
CONTINUE TO EXCEED NATIONAL

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.416
ARMS AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:26.717
WITH YOU KNOW WE SUGGEST TO

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:29.120
FOCUS ON. TRYING TO GET

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:31.255
ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TO THE

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:33.491
PEOPLE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.092
MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC-

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.460
THE SECOND QUESTION WE SUGGEST

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.962
ASKING TO ENSURE THE STATE IS

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:38.696
GETTING THE BEST BANG FOR ITS

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.331
BUCK IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:41.999
STATE SPENDING ARE. A

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.501
COMPLEMENTING RATHER THAN

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:45.169
DUPLICATING FEDERAL EFFORTS-

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.304
LET ME GIVE YOU A RECENT

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.005
APPLICATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:50.041
IN THE RECENTLY ADOPTED GOLDEN

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:52.310
STATE STIMULUS- THE GOVERNOR

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.845
INITIALLY PROPOSED TARGETING

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:55.813
SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DIRECT

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.850
PAYMENTS TO. RECIPIENTS OF THE

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:00.384
STATE'S EARNED INCOME TAX

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.552
CREDIT. IN THE BUDGET

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.987
DELIBERATIONS ARE OFFICE

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.689
SUGGESTED- THAT THE STATE

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.757
PAYMENTS SHOULD BE TARGETED TO

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.292
A GROUP THAT TO DATE HAD BEEN

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:11.062
EXCLUDED. FROM THE VERY BROAD

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:12.730
FOR RELIEF EFFORTS AND IN

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.765
PARTICULAR THE- WE'RE- HE ABOUT

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.601
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. ARE

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:19.270
INCONSISTENT WITH THIS- THE

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.038
ULTIMATE GOLDEN STATE SIMILIS A

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:22.573
PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED BY THE

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.909
LEGISLATURE LAST MONTH INCLUDED

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:27.178
ENHANCED RELIEF. OTHER WAS

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.346
TARGETED TO UNDOCUMENTED

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:31.215
WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT OUT

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.218
OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.187
ANOTHER SET OF QUESTIONS- THAT

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:38.055
WE WILL OFFER ATTEMPTS TO GAUGE

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.790
WHETHER THE BENEFITS OF A

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:42.026
PROPOSAL MAYBE ALTERNATELY BE

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.894
GREATER OR LESS THAN THEY MAY

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:46.364
INITIALLY APPEAR- FIRST IS

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:49.700
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW LARGE

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:50.267
THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:52.770
BOTH. COST FOR STATE AGENCIES

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:56.607
AND COST TO- APPLICANTS OF THE

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.342
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OF AN

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:00.011
ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAM

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.779
IDEALLY SHOULD BE A SMALL SHARE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:04.181
OF THE OVERALL COST- BUT A

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.116
SMALL PROGRAM WITH A

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:06.851
COMPLICATED ENROLLMENT PROCESS

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.486
MAY HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:09.420
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.255
SKIN. DIMINISH THE AMOUNT OF

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:13.391
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERING

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.659
THE INTENDED BENEFITS SO

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:16.627
THERE'S ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:17.895
TRADE OFF TO BE CONSIDERED

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.564
ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:21.832
DETAIL AND NUANCE THAT THE

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.367
PROGRAM CAN INCORPORATE VERSES

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.436
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. THAT

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:29.340
WE'RE PLACING ON PARTICIPANTS

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:32.977
AND STATE AGENCIES- RELATEDLY

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.245
WE SUGGEST TAKING ACCOUNT OF

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.614
WHETHER PROPOSAL- WOULD BE A

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.649
NEW OR EXISTING PROGRAM A NEW

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.885
PROGRAMS WILL TAKE TIME AND

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.653
RESOURCES TO SET UP AND THIS

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.055
AGAIN CAN LESSEN THE OVERALL

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.724
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OVER PROGRAM

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.627
IN CONCERT IN CONTRAST. TO THE

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.462
EXPANDING EXISTING PROGRAM OR

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:54.298
INSTITUTION CAN BE LEVERAGED OF

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:57.401
THESE CONCERNS ARE LESS AND- WE

00:38:57.468 --> 00:39:00.905
ALSO SUGGEST ASKING ENSURING-

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.541
ARE WE AVOIDING. UNNECESSARY

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:05.443
DUPLICATION OF EFFORT OUR

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.578
BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROGRAM

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:09.580
TO THE STATE SPEND STATE FUNDS

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.282
ARE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS.

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:12.283
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.784
POLICYMAKERS TO TAKE STOCK OF

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:16.954
THE EXISTING A RELATED EFFORTS

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.422
AT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.926
LEVELS- HAVING MANY SIMILAR

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.027
PROGRAMS SPREAD ACROSS

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.029
DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES ARE

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:26.597
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT-

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.466
CAN BE INEFFICIENT IT CAN BE

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:29.867
CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE OR

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.703
BUSINESSES THE PROGRAMS ARE

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.206
INTENDED TO BENEFIT. ARE WE

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:36.974
ALSO SUGGEST ASKING WHETHER THE

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:37.875
PROGRAM WILL EFFECTIVELY

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.544
INCREASE PRIVATE SECTOR HIRING

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.913
INVESTMENT- WHERE THE WHERE THE

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.982
GOAL PROGRAM IS TO ENCOURAGE

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:45.449
CERTAIN PRIVATE SECTOR

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.918
ACTIVITIES- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:50.988
CONSIDER- ENSURE THAT THE

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.523
INCENTIVE PROVIDED IS LARGE

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.226
ENOUGH. IMPROPERLY TARGETED TO

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.762
ACTUALLY CHANGE THE DECISIONS

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:00.231
OF PEOPLE OR BUSINESSES IN THE

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:04.001
WAY THAT IS INTENDED. OUR WE

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:06.203
ALSO SUGGEST ASKING A LOOKING

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.606
INTO WHETHER THEIR CONSTRAINTS.

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.107
IN THE RELEVANT LABOR MARKETS

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.642
AND CERTAIN CONDITIONS CAN MAKE

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.944
ECONOMIC STIMULUS MORE OR LESS

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.813
EFFECTIVE AND INCREASING

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.817
EMPLOYMENT FOR EXAMPLE- OUR

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.385
PROGRAM AIMED AT STIMULUS CAN

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.154
BE LESS EFFECTIVE WHEN THERE

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.222
ARE CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD MAKE

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.725
HIRING FOR THE PROJECT OR

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.060
PROGRAM DIFFICULT FOR EXAMPLE.

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.096
IF UNEMPLOYMENT IS VERY LOW

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.331
AMONG KEY OCCUPATIONS NEEDED

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:38.536
FOR PROJECT. FINALLY I THINK

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:39.103
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARE HOW

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.372
MUCH FUNDING WILL BE SPENT

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:44.041
OUTSIDE THE STATE- BECAUSE OUR

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.644
ECONOMY IS CLOSELY INTEGRATED

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.012
WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER

00:40:48.078 --> 00:40:50.447
COUNTRIES I CAN BE IMPORTANT

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.983
DISCUSS WHAT A PORTION. OF THE

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.819
WORKERS AND MATERIALS WERE

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.419
PROJECT WILL COME FROM WITHIN

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:58.355
CALIFORNIA OF THOSE THAT USE-

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:00.758
MORE LOCALLY SOURCED SOURCED

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.693
WORKERS- OR MATERIALS I'M MORE

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.628
LIKELY TO HAVE A LARGER IMPACT

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:07.765
ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AT

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:10.134
LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM. WELL

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.669
THE FINAL TWO QUESTIONS IN OUR

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.070
FRAMEWORK THAT WE SUGGEST

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.139
CONSIDERING. AIM TO ENSURE THAT

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.208
PROGRAM IS PROVIDING BENEFITS

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.043
WHEN AND WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:21.679
WANTS THEM. FOR SIMPLY PUT WILL

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:23.447
THE BENEFITS TO BE REALIZED

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:26.083
QUICKLY. IT STANDS TO REASON I

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.985
THINK THAT NEW PUBLIC SPENDING

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.887
IS LIKELY TO BEMORE EFFECTIVE

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:32.122
AT STIMULATING THE ECONOMY I

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:33.457
DURING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.326
THE SESSION. THE RECESSION

00:41:35.392 --> 00:41:38.162
STARTED LIKE THE PERIOD THAT

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.830
WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. AND FOR

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.832
THIS REASON IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.801
CAREFULLY ASSESS AND MAKE

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.736
PRACTICAL SANCTIONS ABOUT WHEN.

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:47.838
THE BENEFITS OF A PROGRAM OR

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.907
PROJECT CAN BE REALIZED AND WE

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.642
THINK RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHERE THE

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.143
STATE IS IN IT AND IT'S

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.879
RECOVERY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:41:54.945 --> 00:42:01.285
FOCUS ON. BENEFITS THAT CAN BE-

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:04.154
THEY CAN BE- DISTRIBUTED INTO

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:08.525
THE ECONOMY QUICKLY- WE ALSO

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:09.526
SUGGEST ASKING HOW WOULD THE

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.528
BENEFITS BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.697
DIFFERENT- POPULATIONS AND

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:17.434
REGIONS OF THE STATE- SOME

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.303
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.071
PROGRAMS TARGET INVESTMENT IN

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:23.274
AREAS OF THE STATE WITH HIGH

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.909
POVERTY AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:27.044
I AM WHEN CONSIDERING A

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.979
PROPOSALS LIKE THESE WE THINK

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.147
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.715
SCRUTINIZE THE RULES AND

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:34.251
STANDARDS USED TO IDENTIFY-

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:36.687
THESE AREAS OF SEVERAL PAST

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:39.156
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.524
ALONG THESE LINES BECAUSE

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:44.094
THEY'VE HAD OVERLY BROAD OR

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.996
AMBITIOUS TARGETING. ALSO IN

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:48.098
THE VEIN OF DISTRIBUTION- WE

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:50.534
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.803
THAT. OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.471
EXACERBATING EXISTING

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.206
INEQUITIES ACROSS COMMUNITIES

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.741
ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE AND

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:00.444
ONE IMPORTANT- WAY OF THINKING

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.313
ABOUT TIS IS WHETHER OR NOT

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:05.215
THERE WILL BE- DISADVANTAGES OF

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.016
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IN

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.952
ACCESSING PROGRAM FUNDS OR

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:10.054
APPLYING FOR FUNDS. AND HOW

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.655
THOSE DISADVANTAGES CAN BE

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:15.693
TAKEN TO AN ACCOUNT IN THE IN

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:18.228
THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS-

THESE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO FIND

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:32.696
THAT THE BENEFITS FROM THESE

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.514
SIGNIFICANT POLICY QUESTIONS

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.316
THAT WE THINK WARRANT. CAREFUL

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:53.851
CONSIDERATION BY THE

ACCELERATEDTIMELINE- THAT WE

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:03.560
THINK IS NECESSITATED BY THE

THIS IS ALMOST BY DEFINITION OF

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:24.081
WHAT BUSINESSES WOULD BE

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:27.518
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT-

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:29.553
WE THEREFORE HAVE SUGGESTED THE

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.156
LEGISLATURE FOCUS RESOURCES ON

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:35.526

ANOTHER KEY APPROACH TO

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:58.282

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:06.857
SPENDING- FUNCTIONING AND WELL

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:07.257
MAINTAINED PUBLIC

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:09.526
INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNDOUBTEDLY

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:11.094
IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S OUT

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:14.598
LONG TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.099
THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:19.570
WOULD REITERATE SOME POINTS-

00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:20.270
FROM A FRAMEWORK THAT I JUST

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.206
OUTLINED THAT WE THINK ARE

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:23.874
IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING ABOUT

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.809
INFRASTRUCTURE AS A TOOL TO

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:28.011
SUPPORT NEAR TERM. ECONOMIC

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:32.749
ACTIVITY. FIRST WE THINK IT'S

00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:33.550
IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.719
SCRUTINIZE- HOW MANY MORE

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.454
PROJECTS CAN PRACTICALLY GET

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.223
STARTED WHILE ECONOMIC

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:43.594
CONDITIONS REMAIN. DEPRESSED-

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.529
LANANE PERMITTING AND DESIGN OF

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.664
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.333
OFTEN TAKES YEARS TO COMPLETE

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:51.768
AND GIVEN THE LONG TERM

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:52.736
IMPORTANCE OF MAJOR

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:54.972
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.340
RUSHING THESE PLANNING PHASES

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.442
MAY NOT REALLY MAKE SENSE IN

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:00.978
MANY CASES- AND THIS WILL LIMIT

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.412
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE STATE

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:05.182
CAN GET INTO THE ECONOMY. IN

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:06.683
THE NEAR TERM THROUGH NEW

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.186
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- THAT

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:11.555
BEING SAID. WAS THIS DOESN'T

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.589
MEAN THAT THE PROCESS SHOULD

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.958
NOT BE STARTED NOW- FOR

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:17.261
WORTHWHILE PROJECTS- THAT WILL

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:19.229
SUPPORT THE STATE'S LONG TERM

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:21.765
ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT'S

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:24.801
ESPECIALLY TRUE IF WE DO SEE A

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:27.004
MAJOR FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.172
FUNDING PACKAGE GO FORWARD TO

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.941
SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:34.578
AT THE STATE LEVEL- ONE OPTION

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.113
THOUGH TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:39.016
DOLLARS MORE QUICKLY OUR COULD

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:41.184
BE TO FOCUS ON ACCELERATING

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:43.220
NECESSARY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.255
OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:49.526
FACILITIES- ANOTHER QUESTION

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.329
THAT WE WOULD POSE ABOUT-

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.197
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A NEAR TERM

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.333
ECONOMIC RECOVERY TOOL. IS

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.367
WHETHER THE STATE HAS A

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:59.770
STRATEGY IN PLACE TO RECEIVE

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.171
FEDERAL FUNDS IN A COORDINATED

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:04.574
MANNER AND AVOID DUPLICATION OF

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:07.878
EFFORT ACROSS AGENCIES- RIGHT

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:10.147
NOW WE'RE NOT SO. CONFIDENT

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:13.917
THAT SUBJECT A PLAN EXISTS- AND

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:15.719
LET ME KIND OF GIVE YOU ONE

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:18.388
EXAMPLE THAT IS DRAWN FROM A

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.756
POT OF MONEY AVAILABLE UNDER

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:23.994
THE AMERICAN A RESCUE PLAN-

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:26.229
SPECIFICALLY THE A. R. P.

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:29.666
INCLUDES. A TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:30.901
FOR STATES TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:34.037
PROJECTS THAT DIRECTLY ENABLE.

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.206
WORK EDUCATION AND HEALTH

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:38.775
MONITORING IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:42.212
PANDEMIC- AND WE THINK THAT

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:44.047
THERE ARE SOME KIND OF JUST

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.749
BASIC UNIT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.984
ABOUT THIS PART OF MONEY IN THE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.720
STATE'S ABILITY TO DEPLOY IT-

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:53.423
SPECIFICALLY- WHICH IT'S NOT

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.758
CLEAR WHICH THE DEPARTMENT WILL

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.294
BE COORDINATING THE EFFORTS

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.096
ACROSS STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.664
THAT WE ARE LEAVING ANY MONEY

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.500
ON THE TABLE AND THAT PROJECTS-

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.535
ARE. ARE FOLLOWING SOME SORT OF

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:08.605
STRATEGY. WHAT TYPES OF

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:11.942
PROJECTS CAN BE STARTED FASTER

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:14.044
THAN OTHERS. AND IT'S ALSO NOT

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.013
CLEAR HOW THE STATE PLANS TO-

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.716
PRIORITIZE. ANY FEDERAL FUNDING

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:22.252
THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE- UNDER

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:26.823
THIS PROVISION- FINALLY WE

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.059
SUGGESTS- CONSIDERING HOW THE

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:31.294
STATE'S EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:34.231
PLAN. BOMB CAN ALIGN WITHIN

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:35.999
COMPLEMENT ATTENTION FEDERAL

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:39.970
EFFORTS- FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:43.240
PRIORITIZING STATE PROJECTS. IN

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.742
AREAS THAT ARE UNLIKELY TO

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.310
RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING-

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:49.646
SIMILAR- ARE WE MAXIMIZING OUR

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.149
ELIGIBILITY AND USE OF FEDERAL

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:56.253
FUNDS IN GENERAL- SPENDING

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.721
FEDERAL FUNDING ON

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.990
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OR- IN

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.158
THE PROGRAM IN THE STATE IS

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:03.794
LIKELY TO RESULT IN GREATER

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.429
ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR THE STATE

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:08.298
ECONOMY OVERALL- BECAUSE AS I

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:09.966
MENTIONED BEFORE STATE SPENDING

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.735
COMES WITH THIS THIS DIRECT

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.004
TRADE OFF OF BEING AVAILABLE

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.641
FOR OTHER STATE PROGRAMS-

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:18.074
SIMILARLY WE SUGGEST

00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:21.745
CONSIDERING. HOW THE STATE HOW

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:25.582
DOES THE STRATEGY ALSO CAN BESTCOMPLEMENT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:30.854
EFFORTS- SO WITH THAT- THAT

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.589
KIND OF CONCLUDES MY SUMMARY OF

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:33.924
OUR OUR FRAMEWORK AND ITS

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.927
APPLICATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:37.494

SHOULD BE ASKRI ASKING AND

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.806
CONSIDERING. I WILL START OFF

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.575
WELL MAYBE WITH THE QUESTIONER

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.276

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:02.118
DISPARITIES AND ACCESSIBLE WHAT

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:03.453
DO YOU RECOMMEND AS TO WHAT

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.121
ACTIONS THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.823
ADMINISTRATION CAN TAKE TO

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:07.591
REALLY MITIGATE THE

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.626
DISPARITIES. AMONG DIFFERENT

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:12.295
BUSINESS OWNER GROUPS I'D SAY

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:13.530
WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ARE

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:16.566
BUSINESSES LOCATED IN RURAL

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:21.304
COMMUNITIES HE- YEAH- SO I

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:22.506
THINK THAT THERE'S A FEW

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:25.175
OPTIONS- YOU KNOW HIGHLIGHTING

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.011
A FEW POINTS FROM FROM THE

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:28.812
FRAMEWORK OUTLINED I THINK ONE

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:32.315
THING- THAT THAT CAN BE AN

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:35.452
IMPORTANT TOOL IS. HAVING

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.053
TARGETING OF PROGRAMS OR

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.525
PRIORITIZATION OF- TECHNOMIC

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:43.426
DEVELOPER PROGRAMS BASED ON.

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:44.895
WHETHER OR NOT BUSINESSES ARE

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:46.530
LOCATED AND HISTORICALLY

00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:51.001
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- YOU

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:51.935
KNOW AND I THINK A LOT OF

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.470
PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED I'VE

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:55.839
HAD THOSE KINDS OF- PARAMETERS

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:59.576
IN THE PAST- IT'S IMPORTANT-

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:01.111
THAT YOU KNOW THE WERE SURE

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.779
THAT THE MORE PUTTING THIS

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:07.083
PRIMARIES IN PLACE THOUGH-

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.718
SINCE YOU KNOW DEFINING THOSE

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:11.121
THINGS I NARROWLY ENOUGH TO

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.557
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY. A PROPERLY

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:16.293
IDENTIFY GROUPS THAT ARE MOST

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.762
IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE- OFTEN

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:19.629
THERE CAN BE A TEMPTATION TO

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.831
DEFINE THOSE- THOSE PARAMETERS

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:24.334
VERY A PROBABLY- SO THE FUNDS

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.269
ARE DISTRIBUTED TO MANY PARTS

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.905
OF THE STATE- INSTEAD OF KIND

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.840
OF TARGETED AT THAT THE MOST

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:32.542
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:36.012
ANOTHER- THREE FOUR ONE IS-

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.249
ENSURING. THAT ANY ANY PROGRAM

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:43.753
THAT DOES HAVE- INVOLVED

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.755
APPLICATION PROCESS. THERE IS

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:48.158
FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR TECHNICAL

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:49.793

THE TARGETED STIMULUS TO THOSE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:24.694
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.563
REPORT WHO MAY BE LESS PREPARED

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.498
TO COMPETE FOR THIS TARGET IS

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.734
TENUOUS. AT THIS POINT WHAT ARE

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.436
THE TOP FIVE REASONS OF REGIONS

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.438
SORRY ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FIVE

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.773
REGIONS AND INDUSTRIAL

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.308
CLASSIFICATIONS YOU THINK CAN

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.143
MOST BENEFIT FROM TARGET

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:43.780
STIMULUS IN CALIFORNIA SO IF WE

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:44.381

WHAT ARE YOUR TOP FIVE. TOP

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:51.087
FIVE- I THINK ON THE REGIONAL

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:56.493
PEACE I HONESTLY WOULD- I THINK

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:58.228
I WOULD HAVE TO I THINK YOU

HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:02.899
REGIONAL PEACE ON THE SECTORS-

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.068
I THINK I GUESS IT DEPENDS A

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.336
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT LEVEL OF

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:10.707
INDUSTRIAL CODE- BUT I THINK-

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:12.642
FAR AWAY THE THIS THE SECTORS

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.444
THAT HAVE BEEN. SEEN THE

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.780
GREATEST IMPACT FROM THE

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.815
PANDEMIC AND CONTINUE TO SEE

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:20.483
THE GREATEST DECLINES IN

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.885
EMPLOYMENT AND DECLINES IN

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:24.988
BUSINESS OUR RECEIPTS. ARE IN

PIECE IS GOOD CLEAR OWNERSHIP.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.916
AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISION

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.918

DIFFUSE RESPONSIBILITY

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.823
SCATTERED ACROSS A NUMBER OF

ON IT THE SIMILAR VEIN I. THINK

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.266
ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN REALLY

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.301

HAS BEEN ANOTHER THING THAT

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.205
SEEMS IMPORTANTLY MISSING WHICH

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.374
IS KIND OF A REAL ECONOMIC

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.843
DEVELOPMENT. AGENCY FOR THE

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.279
STATE SO IF I UNDER THE DAVIS

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.414

TECHNOLOGY TRADE AND COMMERCE

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.819

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:33.122
DON'T REALLY HAVE AS A RESULT

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.491
A- FIVE. AND THAT THE FULL

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:37.093

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.511
QUESTION I THINK THAT THE

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.880
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT SUGGEST.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.949
THAT THEY GO BUSINESS CURRENTLY

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.317

ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN-

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.669
UNHEALTHY COMPETITION HAPPENING

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.152
ELEMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED AS

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.854
PART OF THAT WERE THERE ANY

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:48.191
SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS THAT

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.026
THAT ENDED UP ON THE CUTTING

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.327
ROOM FLOOR THAT YOU OR THE L.

A. O. WOULD. LIKE TO ENCOURAGE

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:57.166
US TO CONSIDER FOR A SUBSEQUENT

01:03:57.233 --> 01:04:02.939
POTENTIAL INVESTMENT ACTIONS. I

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.575
THINK THAT RIGHT NOW- THE THING

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.210
THAT OUR OFFICE IS HIGHLIGHTED

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:11.881
AS- KIND OF THE MOST IMPORTANT-

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:12.949
ACTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.817
ADMINISTRATION TO BE FOCUSING

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:15.952
ON IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:21.424

OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE-

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:26.262
WE THINK. KIND OF THE MOST

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.862
IMPORTANT THING THE STATE CAN

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:29.465
DO FOR BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW- IS

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.934
TO CONTINUE CONTINUE TO ENSURE

VACCINES CONTINUE TESTING- TO.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.712
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. INDUSTRY

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.113
GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THAT

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.449

FOCUSING ON- WHERE. ADDITIONAL

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:14.644
THOSE ARE KIND OF THE KEY THE

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:17.113

IDEAS ON HOW TO GET TO WHERE WE

NEED TO BE. AND WORKING FROM

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.771
SECRETARY SHOES- AND THE

SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING SO

OPPORTUNITIES IF I CAN'T SO

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:16.058
WHERE WE ARE. IN NOT TO REPEAT.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.593
EVERYTHING THAT MR MUELLER WELL

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.762
LAID OUT IN HIS PRESENTATION

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:22.131
ECONOMIC SHOCK. OF THE PANDEMIC

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.200
HIT. AS WE ALL KNOW THE MOST

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:26.135
VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THE

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.169
HARDEST IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.171
COLOR. LOW INCOME WORKERS

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:32.341
WOMEN. IN THE PANDEMIC DIDN'T

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.810
CREATE THESE UNJUST. CONDITIONS

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.645
AS YOU POINTED OUT MADAM CHAIR-

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.481
BUT IT EXACERBATED THOSE IT

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.082
LAID BARE THESE. DEEP

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.585
INEQUITIES IN OUR ECONOMY. SO I

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.554
THINK THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.121
BECAUSE THAT WAS A QUESTION

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:47.122
THAT WAS RAISED. OR A

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.557
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AN IMPORTANT

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.458
ONE THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.193
THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON IS THAT

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.128
THE NUMBER OF GOOD QUALITY JOBS

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:54.964
IN CALIFORNIA. THAT NUMBER IS

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.398
FAR LESS THAN THAN THE NUMBER

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:59.034
OF PEOPLE WHO NEED GOOD. JOBS

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:00.269
THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.671
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. I THINK

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:06.108
IS INADEQUATE. WE TEND TO.

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.710
APPROACH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.879
IN A WAY THAT LOOKS KIND KIND

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.113
OF FROM A PROGRAM CENTRIC

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.315
PERSPECTIVE- WE TRAIN WE

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.984
PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES-

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.452
AND THEN WE SEND PEOPLE OUT IN

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.953
LABOR MARKETS KIND OF ON THEIR

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.289
OWN IN HOPES THAT THEY CONNECT

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.191
TO IT. A GOOD QUALITY JOB. WE

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.692
HOPE THAT WE'VE GIVEN HIM THE

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:24.126
WHERE WITH ALL TO BE

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.961
COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO LAND A

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.997
GOOD JOB. PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.533
HE SIGNED THAT WORKFORCE

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:31.634
INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.270
CALL THAT RAINING PRICE WHICH

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:34.870
I USE A LOT I THINK IT SUMS IT

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:40.009
UP. IN THE MICRO SENSE. THAT

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:42.144
WORKS OUT AND WE THINK ABOUT IT

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.012
THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SITE

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.079
IS THAT YOU GIVE AN INDIVIDUAL

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:45.915
WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR A LEG UP

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:47.316
IN A COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.451
UP FOR GOOD QUALITY JOB THAT'S

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.487
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. AND THAT

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.888
DOES WORK IN IN IN THAT

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.658
INDIVIDUAL'S CASE IN THE MACRO

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.560
IT DOESN'T WORK- BECAUSE WE'RE

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.628
BUILDING COMPETITION FOR TOO

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.330
FEW JOBS THAT'S A STRUCTURAL

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.732
PROBLEM AND IN THE END WHEN

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.001
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL AT BUILDING

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:08.504
COMPETITION FOR TOO FEW JOBS-

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.172
WE HAVE A DOWNWARD EFFECT ON ON

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.507
WAGES SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.208
LINK UP WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.476
DEVELOPMENT IN VERY INTENTIONAL

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.645
WAY- AND OF COURSE AS YOU AS

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.414
YOU WELL KNOW. THERE ARE VERY

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.317
REAL HISTORICAL IMPACTS OF

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.185
PRIVILEGE RACE AND GENDER ARE

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.887
UNTRUE AND WHAT GROUPS WIN OUT

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.922
IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPETITION

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:30.626
FOR TOO FEW A GOOD QUALITY JOBS

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:32.027
SO WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE. THE

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.630
AS- IF YOU ARE I THINK POINTED

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:35.598
FOR THE RECOVERY IS NOT TO

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.833
RETURN TO THE SAME ECONOMIC

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.368
INJUSTICES AND INEQUITIES OF

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.269
THE PAST BUT TO COME OUT

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.271
STRONGER MORE EQUITABLE AND

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:45.808
MORE RESILIENT- WE KNOW THAT.

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:47.676
EQUITY WE KNOW THAT SHARED

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.745
PROSPERITY A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.780
AS THE GOVERNOR SAYS. IS GOOD

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.082
FOR THE ECONOMY BROADLY WHEN

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:54.817
PEOPLE EARN MORE WHEN THEY HAVE

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.051
GREATER INCOME SECURITY WHEN

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:58.420
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ONGOING

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.189
SKILLS TRAINING AND EDUCATION

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.323
AND THE ABILITY TO BE MOBILE

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.025
AND ROCK. ARE GREATER INCOME

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.994
SECURITY AS A RESULT OF THAT.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.128
THAT'S GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.262
IT'S VERY GOOD FOR FAMILY

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.965
STRENGTHENS FAMILIES- AND IT'S

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.167
GREAT FOR BUSINESS- HOW DO WE

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.236
GET THERE ARE. YOU THERE THERE

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.504
ARE THREE KIND OF MAIN

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.206
CATEGORIES THAT THAT WE THINK

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:18.307
ABOUT WHAT WE'VE GOT TO REALLY

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.142
BE INTENTIONAL ONE IS TO

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.909
IMPROVE ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:24.013
JOBS. THROUGH EDUCATION

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:24.613
TRAINING BUT ALSO PARTNERSHIPS

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.981
WITH INDUSTRY. CREATE MORE GOOD

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:28.751
JOBS- THROUGH INVESTMENTS

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:29.985
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.820
OTHER WAYS CREEK JUST INCREASE

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.223
THE NUMBER OF JOBS RELATIVE

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.591
GOOD JOBS RELATIVE TO THE

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.726
NUMBER OF BAD JOBS. AND THE

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.028
NUMBER THREE IS TO IMPROVE

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:41.163
EXISTING JOBS. AND I THINK THE

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.064
TECHNICAL TERM IS TO TURN

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.999
CRAPPIE JOBS AND GOOD JOBS BUT

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:44.867
I WON'T USE THAT TECHNICAL

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:48.137
TERM. THE HYBRID APPROACH IS

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.005
WHAT WE APPLY TO THIS AND IT'S-

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:51.440
I USE IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:52.107
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.243
THAT'S OFTEN. HOW WE TALK ABOUT

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.944
IT BUT IT'S ALSO APPLICABLES

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.312
MORE BROADLY I THINK THE

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.815
CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:00.282
AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.718
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. THE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.987
HYBRID APPROACH. THAT IS A

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:07.690
SPECIFIC AN EMERGING FIELD OF

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:08.157
PRACTICE IN WORKFORCE

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:10.125
DEVELOPMENT AND HAS. FOUR MAIN

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.894
PILLARS THAT ARE QUICKLY TALK

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.530
ABOUT. THE FIRST JOB QUALITY

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.532
SECOND IS- IS WORKER VOICE

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:19.234
THIRTIES EQUITY IN THE LAST SIX

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:22.237
CLIMATE ON JOB QUALITY. THIS IS

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.072
TURNING THE TRADITIONAL

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:24.540
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.275
KIND OF ON ITS HEAD UPSIDE DOWN

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.176
SO YOU DON'T START WITH

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.811
PROGRAMS YOU KNOW PUSH PEOPLE

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.112
OUT LABOR MARKETS INSTEAD YOU

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:30.879
START WITH THE BEST QUALITY

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:33.215
JOBS. IN INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.016
ARE DRIVING REGIONAL

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.118
EMPLOYMENT. IN THE DNA OF THIS

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.653
HYBRID APPROACH IS DEEP

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.488
INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT. THAT

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.256
CREATES THE CONDITIONS BOTH FOR

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.225
WORKERS TRANSMIT ON THE JOB

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:46.095
MOVING PEOPLE UP. AND ALSO

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.262
ACCESS TO QUALITY JOBS FOR NEW

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.098
HIRES. ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.800
THAT HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.836
GOOD QUALITY JOBS TRADITIONALLY.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.371
THE SECOND IS WORKER VOICE IN

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:59.141
AGENCY ON THE JOB ESPECIALLY AS

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.944
JOBS IN INDUSTRIES CHANGE. DUE

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.478
TO CLIMATE AUTOMATION AND

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.213
COVIDIEN PACKS OF COKE WORKERS

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.981
IN COMMUNITIES WERE MOST

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:06.582
IMPACTED NEED A SEAT AT THE

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:09.318
TABLE ARE IN CO DOT CO

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.019
DESIGNING. THE FUTURE WORK AND

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:13.522
THEN FINALLY NOT FINALLY EQUITY

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.556
TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE PROGRAMS

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:15.858
AS I AS I SAID FOCUS ON

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:18.393
POPULATIONS. WELL I DIDN'T SAY

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.728
THIS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT POINT

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.463
OUT TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.665
PROGRAMS FOCUS ON POPULATIONS

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:25.701
WITH BEARS TO EMPLOYMENT SO

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:28.137
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS.

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:28.837
SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.706
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ME BASED

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:31.440
ORGANIZATIONS WERE VERY MISSION

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:34.843
DRIVEN UP ALREADY ARE ARE

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:35.944
TARGETING THOSE WORKERS WHO

HAVE. WHO NEED A GOOD JOB THE

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:42.351
MOST BUT ALSO NEED THE MOST

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.119
HELP TO GET THERE. ARE HOWEVER.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.955
TO ACHIEVE EQUITY. YOU CAN'T

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:49.057
JUST WORK ON THE SUPPLY SIDE ON

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:51.026
WHAT WORKERS NEED YOU HAVE TO

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.094
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO JOB

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.663
QUALITY BECAUSE OF LOW INCOME

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:58.200
CALIFORNIANS. PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.968
ARE UNDER EMPLOYED UNEMPLOYED

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.371
OR WORKING HARD TO STATE JUST

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:05.541
ABOVE POVERTY OFTEN WORKING

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.543
MORE THAN ONE JOB. DON'T NEED

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:11.613
ACCESS TO. ANOTHER LOW WAGE JOB

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.815
THAT'S DEAD AND WHAT THEY NEED

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.883
ACCESS TO YOU IS A GOOD QUALITY

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.018
JOBS SO THAT'S GOT TO BE OUR

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.453

PEOPLE INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:27.596
INSTEAD OF PUSHING PEOPLE INTO

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:28.831
LABOR MARKETS TO FEND FOR

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.265
THEMSELVES AND THEN FINALLY A

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:33.101
CLIMATE SO FOCUS ON INDUSTRIES.

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.469
OCCUPATIONS WORKERS. AND

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.037
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST

CHANGES IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.280
AUTOMATION SO NOT VERY QUICKLY

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.449
I'LL WRAP UP WITH JUST A FEW

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.618
OPPORTUNITIES. WERE REALLY

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.653
PUSHING. HARD TO BUILD MORE

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.088
SECTOR BASED HYBRID TRAIN

TRADES AS WE BUILD OUR BECAUSE

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:30.859
OUR INVESTING IS DIMINISHED WE

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.127
HAVE NOW A MECHANISM TO GET

WORKFORCE BOARDS COLLEGES AND

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:46.241
UNIVERSAL CONDITIONS I THINK.

INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.619
ABOUT. RE REALIZING THE

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.354
STIMULUS IMPACTS OF THE

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:01.390
RECOVERY MONEY. MEANS CREATING

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.991
PATHWAYS TO GOOD JOBS THAT ARE

MOST NEED THOSE GOOD JOBS AND

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.497
I'LL I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.699
THERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME.

ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED ARE

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:17.773
VERY VERY OFTEN- WITHIN THIS

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:18.473
BODY AND ALSO WITHIN OUR

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.842
COMMUNITIES. I DO HAVE A QUICK

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.778
QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO OUR

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.379
TRANSITION TO A LOWER CARBON

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.515
ECONOMY HOW DO YOU SEE. THE

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.116
STATE'S TRANSITION TO LOWER

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:31.286
CARBON ECONOMY- IMPACTING

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.488
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND OUR

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:36.458
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.893
YEAH IT'S A IT'S DIRECTLY

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.861
RELATED SO WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:40.929
DOING AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.864
TO DO IS LOOKING AT THOSE

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:43.966
SECTORS KNOWS COMMUNITIES THAT

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.168
ARE MOST IMPACTED BY OUR MOVE

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.369
TO WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE IN

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:51.006
GENTING CALIFORNIA TO MOVE TO-

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:55.310
NET ZERO- A CARBON TAX SO THAT

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.878
MEANS MANUFACTURING

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.281
CONSTRUCTION TRADE LOGISTICS

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.449
REALLY EVERY SECTOR IN THE

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.051
ECONOMY. IS GOING TO BE NEEDING

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.886
TO TRANSITION- AND THAT MEANS

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.189
ALSO BUILDING A WORKFORCE THAT

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.991
CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION TO-

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:10.625
AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT MUCH

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:11.927
OF THAT FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.862
MANUFACTURING THAT SECTOR-

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.430
WHICH IS ALREADY IN IN IN A

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:19.001
PROCESS OF CHANGE I LOOKS VERY

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.435
YEARS AGO I THINK MISTER

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.303
HASTINGS WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.605
IT ALSO CONSTRUCTION MOST OF

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.975
THE JOBS BETTER HE IN CENTRAL

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:29.411
TO- MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.746
ARE ACTUALLY IN THE TRADITIONAL

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.849
TRADES SO OUR INTENTION AROUND

CREATING ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS

DOLLARS ANNUALLY- AND- BUT- A

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.650
BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE

GETTING GREATER SCALE AND

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.030
IMPACT OF THOSE OUT SO THAT

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.765
MEANS- WORKING VERY CLOSELY

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.234
WITH OUR PARTNERS INSIDE THE

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND- YOU

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.010

DEPARTMENT. I'M SO THAT'S ONE

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.817
WAY. AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:29.951
ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:31.519
OUR PARTNERS IN THE

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.587
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE A

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.222
LARGE SAID INVESTMENT. IN

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.625
SKILLS TRAINING IS ACTUALLY

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:37.225
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.994
SYSTEM. INSERT AND IS WELL AS

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.729
OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT.

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.464
MANAGE AND ADMINISTER WHAT

FIRST DOLLARS. AND WE DON'T DO

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.601
THAT BECAUSE WE- BECAUSE WE

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:47.769
PROVIDE SERVICES FROM

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.604
SACRAMENTO IN FACT ALL THE

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:51.139
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED LOCALLY

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:51.906
AT THE POINT OF SERVICE

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.375
DELIVERY WHERE PEOPLE MOST NEED

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:54.376
HELP AND WHAT BUSINESSES NEED

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:56.578
HELP. SO THAT ALIGNMENT IN

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.913
SACRAMENTO IS GOING TO HELP-

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.348
MAKE THE ALIGNMENT ON THE

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:02.250
GROUND AMONG SERVICES. MORE

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.085
SEAMLESS SO THAT COMPANIES AND

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:06.855
WORKERS. ARE FACING NOT A

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.357
COMPLEX PATCHWORK OF PROGRAMS

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.226
BUT ACTION BUT INSTEAD. A

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:13.328
NAVIGABLE KIND OF MORE SEAMLESS

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:15.330
I WORK FOR SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN

GET THE MOST BENEFIT FROM SO I

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.500
THINK THE FIRST ONE IS IT IS

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:21.169
ALIGNMENT THE SECOND ONE IS.

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.103
SIX BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS LIKE

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.471
A LOT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH-

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:24.806
CALIFORNIA'S A THREE TRILLION

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.374
DOLLAR ECONOMIES WE HAVE TO

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.143
LOOK AT WAYS TO REALLY SMARTLY.

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.644
INVEST MORE DOLLARS I THINK

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:31.179
THIS STIMULUS IS GONNA GIVE US

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.348
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO INVEST

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.082

ADDITION TO THAT. BECAUSE WORK

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:42.557
TARGETING UP UP. POPULATIONS

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.526
THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE- WE

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.861
NEED TO BE. ABLE TO INVEST IN

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:47.362
WHAT WE CALL SUPPORTIVE

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.631

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.767
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OUT SOME

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:55.103
OF THE BEST APPRENTICESHIP.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.906

THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING

THAT THE STATE CAN DO IS

PROTOCOLS THAT WERE PUT IN

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:22.483
PLACE BY THE CDC. WE WERE ABLE

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:23.617
TO KEEP A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:26.220

THE CLASSROOM. YEAH THE ABILITY

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:50.911
TO GET INTO A CLASSROOM. BOB

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:52.312
WHAT WE SPEND TWO HUNDRED

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:53.847
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TRAINING

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.716

HASN'T REALLY BEEN TAKEN PLACE

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:13.834
SO IT'S GOING TO START. WHEN IT

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:17.137
COMES TO. THE FUTURE

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.072
INFRASTRUCTURE IS WHERE IT'S AT.

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.675
AND WHILE WE'RE UP ALL IN ON

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:24.545
THE ELECTRIFICATION. AND THE

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.880
GREENING OF THE NEW WORLD. WE

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:29.516
CAN'T MAKE THE MISTAKES OF PAST

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:32.286
PRACTICE AND LEAVE TECHNOLOGY

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.888

ABOUT ENERGY. AND I'M TALKING

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:45.499
ABOUT THE WATER YOU KNOW AS YOU

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.801
KNOW WE LIVE IN A DESERT WATER

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:49.803
IS VERY PRECIOUS TO US IN

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.973
CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE.

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.176
A MUTUAL FUND WATER CONVEYANCE

01:41:56.243 --> 01:42:01.682
ENERGY CONVEYANCE AND- ALSO WE

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:02.983
HAVE TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:05.319
HOUSING CRISIS SO I WOULD ASK-

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.821
THE IMPORTANT THING IS FOR

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.022
POLICY MAKERS IN SACRAMENTO.

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:13.026
WHEN YOU CREATE THE BILL'S ASK

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:16.129
YOURSELF. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:17.731
THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:20.767
PROMOTE GOOD. A SKILLED AND

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:23.770
TRAINED WORKFORCE. SO THAT WE

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:27.541
CAN GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK.

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:30.210
THANK YOU SO MUCH AYE MR MILLER

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:33.146
LET ME TO QUICKLY TURN IT OVER-

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.615
TO MISTER HASTINGS FOR THAT

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:35.782
SAME QUESTION BUT IF YOU CAN

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:39.453
ALSO. PERHAPS ANSWER FROM YOUR

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.522
ORGANIZATION'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:43.490
HAVE BEEN THE THREE BIGGEST

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:46.560
CHALLENGES. ABSOLUTELY THANK

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:47.294
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.062
OPPORTUNITY IS GONNA SOUND

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:50.731
CLICHE- BUT THE BEST THING THAT

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:51.965
THE STATE CAN DO AT THIS MOMENT

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:53.934
IS TO GROW THE PIE. AND THAT IS

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:56.136
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ECONOMY

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:58.005
IS PUT ON A PATTERN OF GROWTH

01:42:58.071 --> 01:42:59.306
SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND AND MAKE

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:01.275
SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS LISTED I

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.310
VIDAK: BACK GROWING PART IN IT

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.244
IT DOES SOUND CLICHE BUT IT'S

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:06.146
VERY IMPORTANT. WE DON'T KNOW

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.814
EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GONNA COME

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:08.415
OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC LET ALONE

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.250
WENT- AND HOPE IS NOT A

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.052
STRATEGY OF HOPING THAT THERE'S

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:13.020
THIS MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:15.389
ACTIVITY THAT SPENT TEN TOP IT

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:16.390
JUST RELEASES ITSELF SO WHAT WE

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:18.258
CAN DO. TOGETHER WITH THE

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:20.127
LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.862
IS THAT YOU KNOW CAN INCREASE

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.830
OUR LOSS AS IT WERE AND I'M

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:24.665
GLAD THAT THE PREVIOUS TWO

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:25.766
SPEAKERS MENTIONED

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.301
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL.

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.669
BECAUSE THE MTA'S TOP

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:29.703
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THIS

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:32.606
SESSION IS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:33.340
OH FOUR WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AN

01:43:33.407 --> 01:43:34.841
INVESTMENT CREDIT FOR

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:36.643
MANUFACTURING CAPITAL AND IT

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.211
WOULD VARY AMONG THE SIZE OF

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:39.079
MANUFACTURED SO WOULD ACTUALLY

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:41.148
REWARD SMALLER MANY FACTS

01:43:41.214 --> 01:43:42.349
WITHIN A SLIGHTLY LARGER

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.017
INCENTIVE THAN. THE LARGER

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:46.553
MANUFACTURER AND HAVING THAT ON

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.055
THE BOOKS IS A CLEAR SIGNAL

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:49.823
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.391
THAT MANUFACTURERS AND IS A

01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:53.627
CRITICAL PART OF THE MONEY AND

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:54.795
ONE THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.697
LARGELY OPEN AS MR MILLER

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:59.199
INDICATED- DURING THE LAST

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:01.001
MONTH NOT EASILY I WILL TELL

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:01.768
YOU BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.136
REMAIN OPEN. A LOT OF OUR

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.071
MEMBERS FALL WITHIN THE

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.105
CRITICAL MANUFACTURING

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:06.640
DESIGNATION AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.008
ABLE TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:10.243
GOING BUT IT IS ONLY WITH

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.312
ADDITIONAL PP AT THE WORK SITE

01:44:12.379 --> 01:44:14.314
ADDITIONAL SEPARATION OF

01:44:14.381 --> 01:44:16.083
EMPLOYEES AND ADDITIONAL

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.551
CHANGES IN OUR POLICIES AND

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:23.223
PRACTICES THAT HAVE. MADE. THAT

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.359
HAPPEN- BUT WE- IT AND WE BEEN

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:26.093
SIX- ALONG THE WAY THOUGH TRAIN

01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:27.327
SEEMS BE A THEME THAT IS COMING

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:28.228
THROUGH FROM ALL OF THE

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:29.930
SPEAKERS. CURRENTLY THE

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:30.831
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL

01:44:30.897 --> 01:44:32.499
EXISTENCE READY MADE IT'S BEEN

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.267
THERE FOR A LONG WHILE. AND

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:35.869
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.204
HAS BEEN DECLINING IT IS

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.272
RESOURCES BE MADE AVAILABLE. IF

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.540
THERE IS A WAY THAT WE COULD

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:42.876
PROP THAT UP TO ENSURE. THAT

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:44.144
TRUCK THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:44.911
IN FACT MORE FUNDS ARE

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.680
AVAILABLE EACH YEAR. WOULD BE

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.582
FANTASTIC- BECAUSE THE MORE

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:51.318
SKILLED LABOR THAT WE HAVE IN

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:51.918
THE STATE IS GOING TO BENEFIT

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:55.288
OUR ECONOMY. BOTH IN THE NEAR

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:55.856
TERM BUT CERTAINLY IN THE IN

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:59.593
THE LONG TERM- FOR THE THREE-

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.761
IT'S I LOST ON THAT THE LAST

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:01.962
SECTION MANAGER. I THINK YOU

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.997
WANT TO FOCUS ON THE- THAT OUR

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:06.166
THREE PRIORITIES. SO IF YOU

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.301
COULD JUST MAYBE SHARE IT- SO

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:11.238
THE THREE CHILD MAYBE

AT HERE. AS AN ORGANIZATION.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:16.043
OKAY THE CHALLENGES IT IS AN

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:18.445
UNKNOWN FUTURE- BUT WILL TURN

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.813
THAT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY IF WE

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.181
DO OUR JOBS CORRECTLY BY

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:23.283
ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE-

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.719
BUT I THINK AB I WANT TO GET

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:26.486
THIS POINTED AT LEAST AT SOME

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.321
POINT THIS MORNING AND THE

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:28.955
BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK RIGHT

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:30.824
NOW IS MORE DYNAMIC AND

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:31.725
POLITICAL AND THAT IS THE

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:34.027
BINARY NATURE OF. THE POLITICAL

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.962
DISCOURSE IN THE IN THE COUNTRY

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:37.364
AND IT IS EITHER A RIGHT OR

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.801
WRONG YES OR NO- AT AT ASSEMBLY

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:43.136
LEFT OR RIGHT WE NEED TO FIND A

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.105
WAY TO HAVE A DISCOURSE WHERE

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.206
WE CAN BRING ISSUES TO THE

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.475
TABLE DISCUSS THEM AND FIND THE

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:51.244
BEST PATHWAY FOR SUCCESS AND-

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:52.846
ALL PLEDGE YOU KNOW OUR

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:54.281
ENGAGEMENT ENACTED IN THAT

01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:55.682
DISCUSSION TO HOPEFULLY BE PART

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:56.616
OF THE SOLUTION NOT PART OF THE

01:45:56.683 --> 01:45:59.052
PROBLEM. BUT IT'S JUST THAT THE

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:01.488
SOCIAL DISCOURSE HAS BECOME SO-

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:05.425
TO SIDE AND THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:06.059
MISSING SOME OPPORTUNITIES AS A

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:06.860

STATE PARTICULARLY AT THIS

01:57:55.868 --> 01:58:00.006
INCREDIBLY CRITICAL JUNCTURE.

01:58:00.072 --> 01:58:01.040
YEAH ABSOLUTELY LET ME GO FIRST

01:58:01.107 --> 01:58:05.011
MR MILLER. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.979
WE HAD SECRETARY ACTUALLY SUED

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:08.815
OUT OF THE INTECH CENTER. I

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:09.982
WHICH IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:11.284
PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA

01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:13.553
STEEL HAT COLLEGE AND AS A

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:16.756
MODEL- HAVING THAT TYPE OF

01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:19.759
PROGRAM AND- OFFERED AROUND THE

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.761
STATE WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:23.463
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:26.165
REPLICABLE THAT THE NEEDS FOR

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:27.433
TRAINING IN THE SOUTH PLANMAY

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.501
BE DIFFERENT THAN THE NEEDS AND

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:30.303
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT TO

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:31.504
IDENTIFY WITH THOSE NEEDS ARE

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:33.372
AND DEVELOP A PUBLIC PRIVATE.

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:35.107
PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE A GREAT

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:37.109
WAY TO GO BECAUSE IT RESIDES

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:38.578
YOU KNOW NOT FULLY WITHIN THE

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:39.479
GOVERNMENT BUT NOT FULLY

01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:41.447
WITHOUT AND IT'S A PARTNERSHIP

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:43.616
IN ONE THAT IS PROVEN SUCCESS.

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:45.718
AND OUR MEMBER CALIFORNIA STEEL

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:47.753
INDUSTRIES AS A BIG BENEFACTOR

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.021
THAT BECAUSE THEY DONATED LAND

01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:51.057
ADJACENT TO THEIR FACILITY. SO

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:53.259
IF WE COULD FIND OTHER PLACES

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:55.628
TO REPLICATE THAT MODEL TO SIT

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:58.364
ALONGSIDE ETP AND OTHER

01:58:58.431 --> 01:58:58.965
TRAINING PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY

01:58:59.031 --> 01:59:00.867
THE LOCAL LEVEL- THAT WOULD BE

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:03.302
A HUGE STEP FORWARD CMT IS

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:04.937
COMMITTED. TO MAKING THOSE

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:07.773
PROGRAMS HAPPEN- AS BEST WE CAN

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.641
BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE LOCAL

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:10.142
IT'S YOU KNOW THE OLD CLICHE

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:11.644
ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL ALL

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:13.212

NEEDS OF THE DIFFERENT AROUND

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.549
THE STATE BUT ONCE WE IDENTIFY

01:59:16.616 --> 01:59:17.884
WHAT THOSE ARE IN THE VARIOUS

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.652
REGIONS I THINK WE'RE OFF TO

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:21.287
THE RACES OF AND WE'RE REALLY

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:23.022
HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN.

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:28.027

HEARING ABOUT IT BUT

01:59:34.233 --> 01:59:37.803
INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE KEY AND-

01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:40.940
UP. THE GREEN THE GREEN NEW

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS NOT
