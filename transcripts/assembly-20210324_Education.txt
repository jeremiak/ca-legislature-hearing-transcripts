K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED AT SCHOOL SITES THROUGH A PROGRAM CALLED THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY MEDIC CAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO INSTITUTIONALIZED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH OVERSEES MEDICARE NOW IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COORDINATE HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH SCHOOLS. SB FIVE SIXTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE GREATER ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOLS AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY CAN SUPPORT DRAW DOWN OF MORE FEDERAL FUNDS THE COBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED INEQUITIES IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES IS INCREASE THE NEED FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AND SCHOOL STAFF OVER THE LAST YEAR. HAVE DEVASTATED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELLNESS. NATIONWIDE OVER ONE IN FIVE YOU HAVE DIAGNOSABLE EMOTIONAL MENTAL. OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS NOW INCREASE. DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. SO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH EVALUATION BUT MENTAL HEALTH. COUNSELLING SERVICE WOULD MEET THE NEEDS. AND HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING. BEING PROVIDED AT THE SCHOOL CAMPUS WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT STUDENTS ARE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH. CALIFORNIA MUST MAXIMIZE THE ACCESSIBILITY ANDEQUITY. OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES. AND AB FIVE SIX THREE JOHN DOES JUST THAT BY CREATING. THE OFF OF THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS AT THE CDC- THE OFFICE WILL PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ENSURING COORDINATED. WHICH TO FIFTH IN MEETING THE INCREASED THE NEED. AND WHILE THE STUDENT HEALTH.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH MINE ON THIS BILL OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS- GLAD WE CAN FINALLY HEAR THIS PIECE OF IT. I'M GLAD THAT THE REST ALSO GOT THROUGH. SO I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY IN THIS COMMITTEE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW DEVASTATING LEARNING LOSS HAS BEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS FACE ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES WERE CONNECTIVITY WAS INITIAL- THE CHALLENGES WE FACE THAT A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS JUST SIMPLY NEVER SHOWED UP- IT AND THERE WAS LOTS OF KIDS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS WELL THIS ISN'T JUST A PUBLIC SCHOOL ISSUE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE KIDS WHO EITHER VOTE PARTIAL EDUCATIONS OR DIDN'T COMPLETELY- GET WHAT THEY NEEDED. AND WE DON'T WANT KIDS TO SUFFER AS A RESULT WE WANT TO HOLD THEM HARMLESS. SO THIS BILL IS PRETTY SIMPLE GIVES OPTIONS FOR PARENTS. TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE GIVEN THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS. IT ALLOWS THEM TO SEEK POSSIBLE RETENTION- I KNOW THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL BUT A PARENT SHOULD KNOW HOW TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING A STUDENT BACK IF MAYBE THEY GOT JUST NOTHING UNFORTUNATELY COULD NEVER REALLY GET ANYTHING ON THE ON MY EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE SMALL ONES BUT PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO. REQUEST THAT IN AND HAVE A- CONSULTATION WITH A SCHOOL TEACHER TO SEE IF THAT'S THE BEST OPTION FOR THE CHILD. WE WANT- STUDENTS AND PARENTS WHO. PERHAPS THEY JUST HAD A TOUGH YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL- COULDN'T LEARN SPANISH ONLINE. GOTTA SEE OTHERWISE WAS ON ON ON- THE ROTATE TO GETTING INTO IT YOU SEE. I WOULD LIKE TO pPASS OF DOESN'T HURT THEIR GPA OVERALL. I'M OBVIOUSLY THE UC AND CSU AS THEY SEE THESE WILL KNOW THAT THE STUDENT PROBABLY HAD SOME STRUGGLES I'M SURE EVERYBODY'S AS HE'S GETTING TO THE SCHOOL NEXT YEAR WE'LL TALK ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES- BUT IT ALLOWS THEM. TO STAY IN THE RANGE OF EIGHTY A OF A GRADE POINT AVERAGE WHICH IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN S. A. T. TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT TO SCHOOL WITHOUT BEING- HELD ACCOUNTABLE ARE TO ACCOUNTABLE FOR. A SITUATION THAT WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL ARE THEY COULD LEARN AND THAT KIND OF. ATMOSPHERE THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR- BEYOND FOURTH YEAR OF CREDIT RECOVERY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY OUR JUNIORS AND SENIORS WHO WHO MAYBE MISSED A LITTLE TOO MUCH CAN STILL GRADUATE. FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH A- HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WHICH WE KNOW IS SUPER AND- SO. THIS JUST PROVIDES CHOICE. AND OPTIONS UP PARENTS SINCE. AND ALLOWS THEM. TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION THAT THEIR OWN FAMILY WENT THROUGH. AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO HOLD- HOLD THEM HARMLESS BASICALLY OUR STUDENTS. SO WITH THAT I WILL I KNOW WE HAVE A STUDENT- TO TESTIFY IT'S A- GREAT THANK YOU YES WE HAVE LEISHA MARTINEZ SHE'S A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT FROM CORONA NORCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SAFEST. MORNING TERMINAL DONALD AND THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LISA MARTINEZ AND I'M A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JUNIOR FROM THE CURRENT MARKET UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

I AND I APPRECIATE THE PARENTS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. BECAUSE ALL TOO OFTEN OVER DECADES OF TEACHING MANY TIMES RETENTION. DOESN'T WORK AND IF YOU. CONSIDER THAT ALONG WITH CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING THROUGH TRAUMA OF THE PANDEMIC BEING RETAINED IN ADDITION COULD BE.

YOUNG GIRLS AS YOUNG AS THE AGE OF EIGHT BEING ADMITTED FOR EATING DISORDERS CUTTING AND OTHER SITUATIONS AND THIS WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AS WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL IN THIS COMMITTEE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS INTENSIFIED THIS HEALTH CRISIS. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE LAST MARCH THEY'VE SUFFERED FROM ISOLATION ANXIETY AND OVER THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM FUTURE AND LACK OF PEER SUPPORT AND CONCERNS WITH FAMILY THAT. THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES AND- WILL INDOOR AND WHAT THIS WILL TAKE AS A TOOL FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WITH THIS WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS HAVE ASKED FOR SUPPORT AND NOT ALWAYS KNOWING HOW TO NAVIGATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM MANY TIMES. THE STUDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN REFERRED AS A STATE WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND TO REAP. BELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE AT SCHOOLS BY ALLOWING APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS A COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES TO PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL SITES IF NEEDED.

THE BILL ESTABLISHES A STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING HOMELESS STUDENTS THIS MEASURE ALSO CREATES THREE GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP LOCAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES USED IN IDENTIFYING AND CONNECTING HOMELESS STUDENTS.

CURRENTLY NO STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING HOMELESS CHILDREN THIS BILL AFFECTS THAT BY IDENTIFYING HOMELESS CHILDREN THE STATE CAN'T INSURE SPEEDY AND DISTRICT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER LIMITED RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST. AB TWENTY SEVEN WILL ALSO CREATE THREE GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DEVELOP REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES USED FOR IDENTIFYING AND CONNECTING HOMELESS STUDENTS AT THE-SERVICE AND- CALLED IT IS GOING TO CAUSE EVEN HIGHER AMOUNTS OF HOMELESS YEARS. IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE KIDS WE CAN CONNECT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES. THE AUDITOR HAS INDICATED THAT TOO MANY SCHOOLS ARE FAILING TO IDENTIFY HOMELESS YOUTH BECAUSE OF INCONSISTENT POLICY. OVER FOUR HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE FAILED TO IDENTIFY A SINGLE HOMELESS STUDENTS SOMETHING THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE DERELICTION OF DUTY FOR US TO HELP. THE HOMELESS YEARS. THE AUDIT HIGH THE SCHOOL DAY NEEDS IN THE BEST PRACTICES AND REGIONAL TECHNO AT THIS CENTER WILL PROVIDE CREEK CRITICAL RESOURCES.

THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES IT IS OUT. THANK YOU. I WITH THAT WE'LL NOW MOVE TO- AB ONE EIGHT ONE FIVE AB EIGHT ONE FIVE FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN. YOU MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AB EIGHT ONE FIVE WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE SCHOOL NURSE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA BY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW- BY STATING THAT ELEAZAR ARE AUTHORIZED TO OFFER IN HOUSE SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS TO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. COBIT NINETEEN PANDA. HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT NURSES PLAY IN SAFEGUARDING OUR THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN ATTEND THE SCHOOL WITHOUT A NURSE PRESENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE WORST NURSE TO STUDENT RATIOS IN THE COUNTRY WITH TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS FOR EVERY SCHOOL NURSE. THE SCHOOL NURSE SHORTAGE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING AS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AMONG STUDENTS SUCH AS CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND ASTHMA CONTINUE TO RISE WITHOUT SCHOOL NURSES NON MEDICAL SCHOOL STAFF MUST PROVIDE CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED. INCLUDING ADMINISTERING INSULIN MODERATE SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES AND ASSISTING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW A CANDIDATE WHO WANTS TO BECOME A SCHOOL NURSE MUST HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND A NURSING LICENSE IN ADDITION SCHOOLERS CANDIDATES MUST COMPLETE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF COURSE WORK TO RECEIVE A CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES. CREDENTIAL HOWEVER ONLY FOR UNIVERSITIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE CURRENTLY OFFER PROGRAMS THAT CAN GRANT THIS THE NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL. AB EIGHT ONE FIVE CREATES AN ADDITIONAL PIPELINE FOR SCHOOL NURSE CANDIDATES TO RECEIVE THIS CREDENTIAL BY ALLOWING ELEAZAR TO OFFER IN HOUSE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS. THESE ALLEY A SPONSORED PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO DR BRIAN JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES AT THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND COLLEEN JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. DOCTOR JOHNSON YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR O'DONNELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS DR BRIAN JOHNSON AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS DIRECTOR SHE DID BEGIN WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT ONE FIVE AS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US. NOW MORE THAN EVER SCHOOL NURSES ARE CRITICAL MEMBERS OF OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE SEVERAL BARRIERS THAT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES EXPERIENCE WHEN WORKING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SCHOOL NURSES. ONE AVERAGE OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED PRELIMINARY SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIALS HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN EACH OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICE CREDENTIALS HAVE BEEN ISSUED PER YEAR ON AVERAGE. DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. THERE IS A SERIOUS RETENTION GAP FOR SCHOOL NURSES A GAP THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN OUR ELEAZAR SCHOOLS AND WITH OUR CHILDREN. WHAT DENTAL OF UNIFIED VIEWS EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FIVE AS A MEANS TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION TO BUT NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR. THE EXISTING CLEAR CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. WE BELIEVE AB EIGHT ONE FIVE WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS AND WILL SUPPORT THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED SCHOOL NURSES ACROSS THE STATE. WE RECENTLY SURVEYED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MEMBERS OF OUR SCHOOL NURSE WORKFORCE WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING UNDER PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL. 80% OF OUR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL HOLDERS ARE NOT ENROLLED IN A PROGRAM AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THESE NURSES INDICATED THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED. IN A CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL PROGRAM OFFERED BY IN ELLIJAY AND VIEW THIS OPTION AS A REASON TO REMAIN EMPLOYED AS A SCHOOL NURSE. AB EIGHT ONE FIVE PERMITS THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING TO CONSIDER NURSE SERVICES CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS APPLICATIONS FROM LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. THESE PROGRAMS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE STANDARD APPROVAL CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMISSION THE VERY SAME STANDARDS TO WHICH I EACH YEAR BASED PROGRAMS ARE HELD. PROVIDING THIS OPTION WOULD PERMIT ELLIE IS TO WORK WITH THE COMMISSION TO CREATE LOCAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SCHOOL NURSE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CHALLENGES WITHIN OUR STATE. FOR THESE REASONS THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT ONE FIVE AND URGES YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOT GO TO COLLEEN JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING HERE ARE NOT ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF MY NAME IS COLLEEN JOHNSON AND I'M THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR HUMAN RESOURCES. FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I HAVE SERVED IN THE ROLE OF HR ADMINISTRATOR FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND PRIDE MYSELF. AND SERVING AS AN EXPERT RECRUITER FOR EDUCATION CAREERS THAT PAID SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS. I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION OR SUCCESSOR. WHICH PROVIDES THE ORGANIZATIONAL MECHANISM FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. AS A DEDICATED MEMBER OF SUCCESS I HAVE SERVED ON THE PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES STEERING COMMITTEE. FOR MANY YEARS IN THIS CAPACITY I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH HR ADMINISTRATORS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE SURE THAT FOR DECADES ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY HARD TO FILL POSITIONS IN OUR SCHOOLS STATE WIDE. IS THAT A CREDENTIAL SCHOOL NURSES AND MORE SO NOW IN THE FACE OF THE PANDEMIC AND EFFORTS TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS. I IS NOT IN USE TO HEAR. FROM MY COUNTERPART THAT THEY HAVE CREDENTIALS SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL VACANCY. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYONE TO FILL THE POSITIONS EVEN AFTER INCREASING SALARIES OFFERING SIGNING BONUSES AND SON EVEN OFFERING TO PAY FOR THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA'S RELIANCE ON TEST FOR I. EIGHTY PROGRAMS AND ONLY ONE IS SERVING NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY ONLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO NEW CLEAR SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIALS WERE ISSUED ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. STILL NURSES WITH THE PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE THEIR CAREER THEIR CLEAR CREDENTIAL WITHIN THE REQUIRED FIVE YEAR PERIOD. DUE TO LACK OF PROGRAM AVAILABILITY WE BELIEVE THAT AB EIGHT FIFTEEN OPENS UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN ALL REGIONS OF OUR STATE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE TO OFFER A SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. WITH THE GOAL OF SUPPORTING SCHOOL EMPLOYERS AND RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED SCHOOL NURSES IN PARTICULAR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS. FOR THESE REASONS THE SAYS IT IS PROUD TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FIFTEEN THANK YOU AND WE URGE YOUR YET BUT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU WELL NOW MOVED TO OPPOSITION- DR SAMANTHA BLACKBURN FROM CSU SACRAMENTO- SCHOOL ISSUES UNDERSCORED LATER THEIR- DOCTOR BLACKBURN MARK GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN PLEASE PROCEED GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU- I AM- TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. OF THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DON'T NEED THIS PROGRAM. WE CURRENTLY HAVE- ALL THE CAPACITY AND ACCESS FOR- SCHOOL NURSES WITH THEIR PRELIMINARY CREDENTIAL- YOUR EXISTING FOR PROGRAMS. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN ACCEPTABLE TO ACCEPT ALL QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. AND THAT'S YOUR ATTACK STATE NTS YOU COLLECTION AS WELL AS FRESNO STATE- AS A MATTER OF FACT SEVENTEEN OUT OF THE CURRENT FIFTY STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN FRESNO'S PROGRAM ARE FROM LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. OUR PROGRAMS ARE EITHER FULLY ONLINE WELL. THEY ALL ARE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND ALL OF THEM ARE- HYBRID ALLOWING FOR FULL TIME WORKING SCHOOL NURSES TO EASILY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER THING THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE NEED SCHOOL OF NURSING EXPERTISE- COOL NURSES ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MATH MEDICINES FUTURE OF NURSING REPORT TO EXCEED A GRADUATE DEGREE TO SUCCEED AND TO ADVANCE PROFESSIONALLY. IN FACT 53% OF TAX STATE CREDENTIAL STUDENTS. PURSUE THEIR MSN. SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CHAU SIXTY ONE STUDENTS FROM OUR LAST COHORT OF NINETY SIX STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING THEIR CREDENTIALS I'M SORRY THEIR THEIR GRADUATE DEGREE THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE WHICH IS OPIONAL BUT WE HAVE OVER HALF PURSUING THAT GRADUATE DEGREE BECAUSE SCHOOL NURSES NEEDED THAT- EXTRA EDUCATION- TO FULLY ADVANCE. AT SCHOOL NURSES PLEASE SUMMER HIRES- YEAH. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DISTRICT RUN PROGRAM WILL NOT ADVANCE THE SCHOOL NURSE PROFESSION. THANK YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEBATE THANK YOU WILL NOT LOSE OUR NEXT WITNESS- DR RACHEL MCCLANAHAN CSU FORTUNES SCHOOL NURSE COORDINATOR. HI GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS RACHEL MCCLANAHAN I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT CAL STATE FULLERTON AND LEAD FOR THE COLLEGE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THERE. I THOUGHT THE BLACKBURN MY SPECIALTY AND MY EXPERTISE IS IN EDUCATING THEIR SAYS. WE EDUCATE NURSES WHO WILL WORK IN THE ICU CARING FOR CULTIVATION. WE EDUCATE OUR PRACTITIONERS STOP LOW COST CLINICS THE STATE. WE EDUCATE NURSES A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND WE EDUCATE NURSES WHO WANT TO EARN A CREDENTIAL AND WORK IN SCHOOL. WE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT ALL OF THESE NOTHING SPECIAL TO YOU ARE. WE HAVE THE ABILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES EXPERIENCE EXPERTISE TO EDUCATE THEM THAT. WE HAVE WELL ESTABLISHED STIMULATION LAB AND HIGHLY EDUCATED AND EXPERIENCED FACULTY. IT IS WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY AND WE DO IT WELL. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE THEIR AN ALLEY A NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM BECAUSE WELL L. YOU CAN EXPERIENCE USING TEACHERS AND- EDUCATING NURSES IS NOT THE SAME THING. A DOCTOR BLACKBURN. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CARE REQUIRED BY CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOL. AND THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT NURSES PROVIDE. EDUCATION SECRETARY GOES BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL HONORED TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. WE THINK THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO APPROACH THAT THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HIGH STANDARDS FOR NURSING EDUCATION THAT ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN OUR STATE. RATHER THAN BUILDING SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND UP STARTING FROM SCRATCH RECREATING THE WHEEL AND DUPLICATING SERVICES ALREADY INSTITUTED. WE PROPOSE THAT THERE IS A BETTER APPROACH ONE THAT WOULD SUPPORT EVERYONE INVOLVED THE CLERK DIDN'T RETALIATES AND THE INSTITUTION OF NOTHING ITSELF. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF SOME KIND WHETHER THEY BE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDENTS A FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM OR SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD WORK FOR BOTH ELEAZAR AND UNIVERSITIES TO ALLOW FOR AND ENSURE THAT FULLER CREDENTIALS DIDN'T CONTINUE TO RECEIVE. DEMONSTRATED HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION THAT GIVES THEM UNIVERSITY CREDIT AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE ADVANCEMENT. WITH SUCH A HUGE OUTLAY TIME AND FINANCE INDEFINITE TO ESTABLISH A NEW PROGRAM AND THE SON RUN KNOWN LIKE. HOW MANY NURSES ACTUALLY ATTEND. AN ALTERNATIVE BILL ALTERNATIVE TO THE FILL IN THE FORM A PARTNERSHIP CAN REDUCE THE LIABILITY FOR ILLEGAL UTILIZING AND LEVERAGING OUR THIRTY CAN YOU DOCTOR AND EXPERTISE I'M ALMOST DONE.

QUICKSILVER HI IT HAS FIVE BUTTONS BILLS FOR A VOTE IT IS OUT. THANK THEM THANK YOU. A GOOD JOB I WILL NOW MOVE TO MR MEDINA. OKAY MISS READY TO AB THREE EIGHTY EIGHT THAT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. BY- TWELVE. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBES I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. THREE EIGHTY EIGHT A MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT NON ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES SERVING IN POSITIONS REQUIRING CERTIFICATION WILL BECOME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING A PROBATIONARY. PERIOD TODAY EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS IN SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BEING DISMISSED AND TERMINATED FOR ARBITRARY REASONS WITHOUT WARNING. UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN TEACHING POSITION AT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WITH THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PUPILS CAN ACHIEVE PERMANENT STATUS AFTER PROBATIONARY PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT CERTIFIED CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN NON TEACHING POSITIONS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ATTAIN PERMANENT STATUS. THIS POLICY AFFECTS GROUPS OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS SCHOOL NURSES ENGLISH LANGUAGE AT EDUCATORS. FOSTER YOUTH COUNSELORS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WITH SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENTS AMONG OTHERS. IN THE CASE OF A DISMISSAL A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE STATUS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST A HEARING BEFORE THE COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE DISMISSAL WAS APPROPRIATE. FURTHER A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST A HEARING. DURING A REDUCTION IN FORCE. UNFORTUNATELY SEVERAL CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE BE DENIED PERMANENT STATUS BASED ON THE NEED TO CREATE FISCAL SOLVENCY. OR ANTICIPATION THAT NEEDS FOR SERVICES IN THE FUTURE PER IN SECURE. THIS LACK OF PERMANENT STATUS HAS ALSO LED TO DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION AND FAVORITISM WITHIN OUR SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS BILL WILL REMEDY THE SITUATION TREATING ALL CERTIFICATED EDUCATION EMPLOYEES WITH DIGNITY RESPECT AND PROFESSIONALISM THAT THEY DESERVE. MY WITNESSES TODAY OUR TO EDUCATORS FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT COULD TREES MOVE A ROO AND ELIZABETH KIRCHER. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. COUNTRIES. THREE THE MORNING.

MR KILEY SECONDS I'M SORRY I'M FINE ARE YOU SECOND NO I'M NOT OKAY I MUST MISS WORK SO SECOND OKAY I IS STILL HAVE A QUESTION FOR HIM IS A FIRST. GOOD MORNING APART SO AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A VERY RULE DISTRICT WITH AND I'VE HEARD FROM SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS ACROSS MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS SMALL SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL- WE'RE ACTUALLY AND I'VE SERVED ON SCHOOL WORK MYSELF SO IN OUR AREA IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD TO FILL THESE POSITIONS WITH QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. SO I'M WONDERING THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION FROM THE SMALL SCHOOLS HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS OR ARE YOU CONVERSATIONS WHAT'S THE STATUS. YES ACTUALLY- ASSEMBLY WOMAN I DID ALSO MET WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- RIGHT YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THAT THEIR CONCERNS. ARE SO WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION- I ALSO WAS A SCHOOL BOARD- NOT NOT OF A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND I DID HEAR FROM THEM THAT. AND SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT'S ONLY THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO MAY HAVE- TENURE AND VERY VERY SMALL- SUPERINTENDENT MIGHT BE- SUPERINTENDENT AND TEACHER SO I DO UNDERSTAND- THOSE CONCERNS AND WE ARE IN CONVERSATION- WILL CONTINUE I'LL CONTINUE TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM- BUT- I VERY MUCH. SYMPATHIZED WITH THE TEACHERS LIKE THE TEACHER THAT WE HEARD FROM WHO WHO CAN BE TWENTY YEARS AT THEIR JOB AND NEVER GET PERMANENT STATUS. SO- I THINK THIS BILL TRIES TO- RECTIFY THAT AND AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE CAN TRY TO WORK WITH THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORRELL I'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME AMENDMENTS THAT COULD POSSIBLY. REMINI THEIR- A HUGE CONCERNS. FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY NOT LESS RIGHT NOW DURING OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPEN WHICH IS NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR MOST OF THE STATE SO IT'S BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED TO COME TO WORK YOU KNOW DURING CALVET SO I BY TECH CONTENT CONVERSATION IF I COULD WITH YOU. WILL DO HAPPY TO STAY IN CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE HERE BECAUSE MACHITO WILL MIXED UP BUT- I HAVE MATTHEW DUSTIN POSSIBLY ON THE PHONE. IN OPPOSITION. YES GOOD MORNING. YES YOU MAY PROCEED SORRY I APOLOGIZE MY FAULT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATTHEW DUSTIN I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT PRINTABLE AND MIDDLE SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHER AT MONTAGUE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. WHERE CATER EIGHT SCHOOL AND SISKIYOU COUNTY ABOUT TWENTY MILES FROM THE OREGON BORDER OUR ENROLLMENT AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE STUDENTS THIS YEAR WE ARE CURRENTLY SERVING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE STUDENTS THERE IN PERSON. AND DISTANCE LEARNING. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT OUR TEACHERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MEDINA AFTER TO PROVIDE THESE INSTRUCTORS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL THAT THAT STABILITY. HOWEVER IN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE DECISIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. SMALL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR FOR MANY SMALL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS THE LINE BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND LABOR IS BLURRED.AS WE PUT ALL THE ROLE OF THE BOTH ADMINISTRATOR AND CLASSROOM TEACHER EACH DAY TO REMAIN FISCALLY SOLVENT. EVEN QUITE POPULATIONS IN OUR ENROLLMENT MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NEEDING OR NOT NEEDING- SECONDARY TEACHERS IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO SECOND CLASSROOM- INSTRUCTORS AT EACH GRADE LEVEL. I FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SCHOOL YEAR OUR ENROLLMENT DROPPED FROM THE 12% DROP IN ONE SCHOOL YEAR THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF LONG BEACH UNIFIED LOSING NEARLY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS BETWEEN ACADEMIC YEARS. AT THAT TIME TO TEACHERS WERE RELEASED AS WELL THE PART TIME ADMINISTRATOR. AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE IN THE NEWS PARENTS HAVE RELOCATED TO DISTRICTS WHERE SCHOOLS WERE OPENED. BY AND LARGE THE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN A SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS. HOWEVER THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW IF THESE THREE LOCATIONS WILL BE PERMANENT PART STUDENTS WILL MOVE AGAIN AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN ACROSS THE STATE. SCHOOLS ARE NOT BUSINESSES WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET PRICES. WE OPERATE ON BUDGETS THAT ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO ENROLLMENT OR IN THE CASE OF THE CURRENT YEAR A BUDGET WHICH FOR MY SCHOOL IS LOCKED AT ONLY 90% OF OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENT AFTER EIGHTY A WAS FROZEN IN TWENTY TWENTY. ALLOWING US TO RE CAPTURE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF OUR GROWTH FUNDING UNDER SB EIGHT TWENTY. TO MAKE A PERMANENT POLICY CHANGE LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WITH THE GROUP GROUND IS STILL MOVING BENEATH THAT'S WITH LOCK DISTRICTS INTO A SITUATION. THAT COULD BE A VIABLE IN THE FUTURE IF WE WORK HARD TO MAINTAIN. A TEACHING FORCE THAT EXCEEDS STUDENT NEED. FOR A- EIGHT. FIVE THREE EIGHTY EIGHT TO BECOME LAW THE SENSE OF SECURITY OR TEACHERS MIGHT ENJOY WOULD UNFORTUNATELY BE FALL. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ENROLLMENT WILL LOOK LIKE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND FLUCTUATIONS THAT A LARGER DISTRICT WOULD CONSIDER. THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OTHER LYNCH. NEED TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I HAVE TWENTY NINE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MY NAME'S ALYSSA LYNCH AND I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF METROPOLITAN EDUCATION DISTRICT AND R. O. P. SERVING TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND SILICON VALLEY. I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE PREPARE STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE AND CAREERS IN SECTORS SUCH AS MEDICAL ASSISTING FIRE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE AS YOU EXTEND PERMANENT STATUS TO RCP TEACHERS WHICH WOULD UPEND THE CTP PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER OUR STUDENTS. ARE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF THE INNOVATIVE AND RELEVANT PATHWAYS WE TEACH CURRENT STATUTE ABOARD ARE PROGRAMS FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT YOU ARE GDP. AND ALWAYS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO STAY CURRENT. TO THE pCHANGES AFFECT WHAT COURSES WE OFFER OR NOT OFFER IF ON LOCAL WORKING NEEDS. AS AN EXAMPLE I NAY HAVE EXCEEDED E. TEACHER WITH A CREDIT IN HEALTH SCIENCE. AND MADDOX WHO TEACHES MEDICAL. IT DOES NOT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY CAN TEACH DENTISTRY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE I HAVE A LEGAL CAREERS TEACHER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE OR SHE COULD TEACH OF FIRE SCIENCE CLASS. IF YOU HAVE A TEACHER WITH A CREDENTIAL THAT THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO TEACH THAT COULD BE A BIG MISTAKE ALL CTE TEACHERS HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT WORK EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS. UNDER THIS BILL AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE A STORAGE WENT RETAIN CTE TEACHERS IN INDUSTRIES. THAT MAY NOT HAVE A LABOR MARKET I COULD BE FORCED TO HAVE TO LEGAL CAREER TEACHERS WHEN I NEED TO FIRE FINE FEATURES. EIGHTEEN PROGRAMS OFFERED ARE ARE BASED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT. AB THREE EIGHT EIGHT WHAT ALSO FORCED ME TO OFFER PROGRAMS THAT I DO NOT HAVE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN. IN CLOSING IT'S NOT A HYPER HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT IF EIGHTY THREE EIGHT EIGHT MOVES FORWARD AS INTRODUCED WOULD LIKELY MEAN THE END OF ROC. IN A MATTER OF JUST YEARS BECAUSE IT WOULD REMOVE OUR ABILITY TO PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE LABOR MARKET IN INDUSTRY WHICH IS THE BEAUTY OF CTE PROGRAMS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW ON AB. THREE EIGHT EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WE HAD COMMENTS FURTHER. EARLIER WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THOSE COMMENTS- MISTER KILEY. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I- I'M GONNA HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY AND I'LL AFTER THE COMMENTS OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN. AT DALLY YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA- ALREADY INTERFERES MORE WITH THE PERSONNEL DECISIONS OF SCHOOL LEADERS ALIKE- MR DUSTIN WHO JUST HEARD FROM AL OR INTERFERES AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER STATE I MEAN WE'RE ONE OF ONLY. FIVE STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS A PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF LESS THAN THREE YEARS YOU'D THINK THAT SINCE WE'RE SUCH A LARGE STATE WE WOULD. BE LESS CENTRALIZED IN FACT WERE MORE CENTRALIZED IN TERMS OF THE STATE INTERFERING WITH THE PERSONNEL DECISIONS. OF SCHOOL LEADERS AND SO- THIS BILL YOU KNOW ELIMINATES SORT OF A MODICUM OF FLEXIBILITY THAT IS RESERVED. FOR SMALLER DISTRICTS I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE. IS- IS TENURE REFORM THAT- PUTS US MORE IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND- THAT'S THE OVERWHELMING PREFERENCE OF TEACHERS AND PACKED- IT SURVEYS SHOW. WE HAVE HAD EFFORTS OF THE AND OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE OF COURSE MY FIRST YEAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TO SPEAK THE BILL MISTER KILEY ENDEAVOR FOR THE RECORD CALIFORNIA SCHOOL TEACHERS OCCASIONAL TEACHERS DO NOT. GET TENURE YOU WILL NOT FIND THAT WORD. THANKS FOR THAT AND I CAN FINISH MY IN ACTIONS EXCEPT. THAT'S RECALL PROFESSORS OKAY NEGATIVES MUST PLEASE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THINGS MOVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION WE HAVE SEEN. EFFORT THAT IN THE PAST THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I THINK IT'S A- SAD COMMENTARY ON THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE MOVING. AT A THAT WE'VE MOVED THAT NOW NOT ONLY. ARE THOSE PROPOSALS NO LONGER HERE OR VIABLE. BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING THINGS EVEN WORSE SO I WOULD- YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES MOVES ALONG. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENT MISS CORK SILVA. TO MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE I KNOW WE HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION AND WE ARE BOTH HUGE PUBLIC EDUCATION ADVOCATES BOTH SERVING AS TEACHERS OURSELVES I DIDN'T MEET WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BOARDS IN THEY DID- EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN NOW THEIR CONCERN IS AND NOT WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES THEIR CONCERN WAS THEIR FEAR OF. HAVING TO NOTICE- AND EMPLOYEES BY MARCH FIFTEENTH AND HOW MUCH THAT REALLY CAN BE VERY UPSETTING AS MANY TIMES THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE IN FACT THEN BROUGHT BACK BUT BECAUSE OF OUR DEADLINES FOR BUDGET. THAT THAT NOT ONLY HAPPENS WITH CLASSIFIED BUT CERTIFIED AND SOMETIMES THE CONCERN OF LOSING EMPLOYEES THAT MAY GO ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN SO I WOULD JUST ASK AND I AM I DID GIVE A SECOND AND I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. AS OF. THE OPPOSITION STATEMENTS RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY UNDER THE C. T. E. ARE OF CONCERN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE- PERMANENT STATUS BUT WE ALSO DON'T LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE MOST UP TO DATE KERR PROFESSIONS- CTAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT PHOTOGRAPHY MIGHT HAVE BEEN. SOMETHING WE WERE TEACHING OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES AND NOW WE MIGHT NEED TO BE TEACHING OF THE PROGRAMMING AND- CANNOT TEACHER. TEACH BOTH A AS WAS NOTED SO AGAIN I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK TO THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT FROM THE MANY SENIOR FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WILL GO TO THE PHONES FOR NO MORE THAN TEN MINUTES.

RIGHT NOW PRUDENTIAL CANDIDATES CAN CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF TESTS TO SATISFY THE VSR INCLUDING THE C. BEST THE SAT AND ACT EXAMS THE AP EXAMS AND THE C. S. P. T. ALL OF THESE TESTS WERE CANCELED DUE TO COVED AND NOW ARE ONLY OPERATING AT ABOUT 50% CAPACITY. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED TEACHER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ONLY BEING MADE WORSE BY THE CANCELLATION OF TESTS IN THE COVERT OUTBREAK WE NEED TO EXPAND AVENUES OF ENTRY INTO. BEING ARBITRARY BARRIERS TO PROGRAMS INCREASING FLEXIBILITY WE CAN BRING IN MORE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN THE SHORTAGES ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNING AS WE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND REQUIRE EVEN MORE TEACHERS ACCOMMODATE NOT ONLY OUR PHYSICAL DISTINCT. DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO THE- LEARNING LOSS ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE. UNLESS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR CANDIDATES TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS AND COMPETENCY ARE PROVIDED. THE SUSPENSION OF SEA BASS TO TESTING WILL MASSIVELY COMPOUND THE EXISTING TEACHER SHORTAGE AB THREE TWELVE OFFERS OUR CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES A FLEXIBILITY TO FULFILL THE BSR AND GET INTO THE CLASSROOM WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE QUALITY OF TEACHERS OUR SCHOOL SO DESPERATELY NEED.

OF THIS IS HAPPENING PEOPLE THE TEACHER PREPARATION PIPELINE IS A ARE STILL TO COMPLETE BASIC SKILLS BEFORE EARNING THEIR CREDENTIALS. THANK YOU AND. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU HELLO WILL NOT HEAR FROM MICHAEL. I BELIEVE IN OPPOSITION. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS WEEKEND PLEASE PROCEED HELLO. OKAY GOOD THANKS HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL ROSKAM WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS AND WERE OPPOSED TO THIS- WE WILL BASICALLY- WE BELIEVE THAT IT'LL PUT- LOCRI TEACHERS INTO THE CLASSROOM WITH A FOCUS ON SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED. WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED AS EMPLOYEES IN WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED FAIRLY IF YOU WANT TO GET MORE SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM THERE ARE WAYS TO GO ABOUT DOING IT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS- THIS BILL HAS SEVERAL COMPONENTS. WERE OBVIOUSLY INTERESTED. IN SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO IT IS WE CAN TAKE CARE OF- PEOPLE USUALLY WE SUBMITTED A LETTER- ALONG WITH- SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS- THEY WERE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO COMMITTEE AT SOME PARTICULAR POINT ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT EXPANDING THE CONCEPT TO GET SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DONE IS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE THE ONES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIRING SUBSTITUTES FOR EIGHT COUNTY. INSTEAD OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS HAVING TO GO IN AND REGISTER ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICT PAY FOR- BISA EXCUSE ME PAY FOR- FINGERPRINTS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF IF WE GET IT IN ONE PARTICULAR SPOT COUNTY OF OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK IN ALL THE DISTRICTS WITHIN THE COUNTY. THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO DO THAT BUT THEY TAKE 20% OF EVERYTHING AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER ARE. YOU REAL PROBLEM BECOMES. IF WE START PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM WHO ARE LET'S SAY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. THEY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE THE KIDS IN A HIGH SCHOOL ARE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA THAT THE CLASSES ARE NOT GOING TO BE- R. AS APPROPRIATE AS THEY SHOULD BE AND THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT HAPPENS IS. AND THAT IS THEY GET FIRED. THE BOTTOM IS A RIGHT FOR SUCH TEACH IN. IF YOU MORE TO IN THE CLASSROOM HOW TO FIX THE SYSTEM THAT SUBSIDY TEACHERS DEAL WITH. WE ASK YOU TO NO THIS. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR SUBSTITUTE. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. WE'VE FROM SOME OPPOSITE WENT OVER BACK TO THE- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I STRUGGLE WITH IT A BIT JUST AS ONE WHO IS A TEACHER. AND STILL SUBS ABOUT THE FALL ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST HEARD A WITNESS MENTIONED PRIVATE COMPANIES HIRING SUBSTITUTES WILL. BE A VIOLATION AB FIVE BUT EITHER WAY I DON'T THINK PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOULD BE. HIRING SUBSTITUTES AND PUTTING A PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM THAT SEEMS RATHER COMPLICATED TO ME. AND MAYBE NOT SAFE BUT I APPRECIATE. THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS ABOUT SOLIDIFYING- THE PREPARATION OF A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS TOTALLY ABOUT ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME OVERLAP MAYBE. BUT I THINK THAT IS AN ISSUE WE COULD ALWAYS CONTEMPLATE GOING FORWARD BUT TODAYAGAIN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS RATHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS CORK SILVA- YEAH I AND I AND- DID NOT READ IT IN DETAIL JUST THE SYNOPSIS BUT IS THERE A TIMELINE ON THIS AS- I KNOW THAT IT'S IT REFERENCING. THE PANDEMIC IN THE URGENCY TO GET TEACHERS. CREDENTIAL INNOCENCE AND SO FORTH BUT IS THERE A TIMELINE ON IT THERE'S NO SUNSET CLAUSE THAT. THAT'S A FANTASTIC. THIS THE THIS IS TO TRY TO GET TO BACK INTO THE SAID AND I WANTED TO. OUT ALL TO THE SPEAKERS THANK THIS DOES NOT SIR. THE HIRING PROCESS OF A TEACHER- SO THE QUALITY OF TEACHERS IS UP TO THE BOARD TO HIRE THEM. EDITED EDUCATION SYSTEM THE HIGHER.AND THEN I THINK A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR IS. I KNOW THE C. BEST HAS ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED TO HIRE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS BUT THEN DISTRICTS INDIVIDUALLY SOMETIMES ADD THEIR OWN PROCESSES ON TOP OF THAT IT IS THAT STILL THE CASE AS FAR AS JUST HAVING THEIR OWN. IF YOU WANT TO SAY ALMOST LIKE A VERSION OF C. BEST SO ARE YOU TALK ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS OR THE CEDARS I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT. IN ORDER TO BE HIRED IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TO PASS A SEA BASS THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THE COULDN'T. STAND THE OTHER HAS HERE'S A PRETTY CLEAN BILL OF SPEAKS TO THE C. BEST NOT NECESSARILY THE HIRING PROCESS I WOULD ARGUE THE HIRING PROCESS IS SOMETHING WE CAN CONTEMPLATE BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S REALLY. THE SMELL MIGHT LIKE NOT TRYING TO IMPACT IN ANY MAN OF THE HIRING PROCESS RIGHT NAY BUT IT'S JUST I KNOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS MIGHT BE. THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASS THE C. BEST AND THAT'S BEEN THE STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER DISTRICTS YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALLY CAN- PUT WHATEVER TYPE OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE ON HIRING. THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME DISTRICTS WHICH MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE TYPES OF HIRING PROCESSES. AND THEN SOME THAT WILL. WITH THIS BILL TAKE. THESE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING COULD. BE IN LIEU OF THE C. BEST PRICE I DON'T THINK THAT ALREADY EXISTS. OKAY THE I THINK THE IDEA TO DO THAT. THANK YOU- BOB. TINA FURTHER COMMITMENT. SORT OF A NATURAL COMMON BUT THE ISSUE ABOUT HAVING SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS BE ABLE TO- DO THE FINGERPRINTING IN THE WHOLE COUNTY SEEMS LIKE A RIGHT TOPIC FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS BUT I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. SOUNDS GOOD- SINGLE FURTHER FROM COMMENT FROM MANY WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL GO TO THE PHONES- TEN MINUTES ON THE PHONES.

NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT ALL YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIVE FOUR FOUR REQUIRES SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATORS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT EACH SCHOOL FACILITIES OWNED OR LEASED. BY THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY TO THE CD. IN ORDER FOR BASIC FACILITY INFORMATION SO THAT BASIC FACILITY I'M INFORMATION MAY BE REPORTED TO OTHERS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ASSIST WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE. WHEN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS FLOOD CONTAGIOUS DISEASE WILDFIRE OR OTHER DISASTER OCCURS. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES NEED BASIC INFORMATION REGARDING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES. THE PRIMARY NEED FOR THIS INFORMATION IS TO ENSURE STUDENT SAFETY. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT RATHER AGENCIES LOOK TO SCHOOL LEADERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENTS AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL LOCATION DURING AN EVACUATION. IN ADDITION. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAY NEED TEMPORARY LOCATIONS TO SET UP A HOUSING FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL SHELTERS FOR EVACUEES OR FACILITIES TO ESTABLISH TEMPORARY CLINICS. DESPITE THE NEED FOR BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF FACILITIES A SCHOOL BUILDINGS DURING EMERGENCY CALIFORNIA LACKS AN INVENTORY OF SCHOOL FACILITY LOCATIONS AND FACILITY INFORMATION. DURING THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE WAS AT TIMES CONFUSION AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL AMONG EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL RELATED TO THE LOCATION OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS DUE TO THIS LACK OF EXISTING INFORMATION AMADOR. ALTHOUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CURRENTLY COLLECTS BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND MAILING ADDRESS OF SCHOOL SIDES. THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS NO MECHANISM OR REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION RELATED TO A SINGLE SCHOOL SITE WITH MULTIPLE BUILDINGS OR LOCATIONS. AB FIVE FOUR FOUR REQUIRES A AN ALLEY A TO REPORT THIS INFORMATION ONCE AND PROVIDE UPDATES ONLY WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE. AB FIVE FOUR FIVE FOUR FOUR WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE WILL CREATE A STATE WIDE CRITICAL INVENTORY OF SCHOOL FACILITIES. WHEN THIS INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE SCHOOL AND EMERGENCY PERSONNEL CAN BETTER COORDINATE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE STUDENT AND SCHOOL PERSONAL PERSONAL SAFETY AS WELL AS A SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.
