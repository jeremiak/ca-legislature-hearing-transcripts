CENTER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:46.117
SPEAKING TO ITEM FORTY THREE THE

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:47.786
HOMELESS YOUTH HUNDRED MILLION

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.354
DOLLAR FUNDING.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.956
I SPEAK TO THIS BECAUSE SANTA

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:53.792
CLARA COUNTY CURRENTLY PROVIDES

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.094
LESS THAN 5% OF ITS FUNDING FOR

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.095
HOMELESS YOUTH.

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:59.164
AND CONSIDERS IT A LOW PRIORITY

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.699
EVEN THOUGH THE LAST POINT IN

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:01.499
TIME COUNT.

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:05.003
HOMELESS YOUTH REPRESENTED 40%

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.872
OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION.

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.306
INDICATIONS ARE IT'S GOING TO GO

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:11.676
UP 50% IN THIS CURRENT POINT IN

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:12.510
TIME COUNT.

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:15.046
BEING CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND WE

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.481
NEED TO HAVE A PRIORITY

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:18.483
STATEWIDE ON HOMELESS YOUTH

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.385
BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LOCAL

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:22.387
JURISDICTIONS JUST DO NOT DO

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.422
THAT FOR THE HEAT MONEY.

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:26.191
EVEN THOUGH THE COUNTY BROADBAND

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:27.826
ELEVEN MILLION BASED ON OUR

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:29.594
pACCOUNT FOR YOU.

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:31.630
THEY GAVE A MILLION TO YOU IF WE

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.798
HAD GOTTEN THAT TOTAL PERCENTAGE

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:36.101
SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER HEAT MONEY

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:38.403
IF YOU SAY A MINIMUM FOR YOU OR

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.771
BASED ON YOUR POINT IN TIME

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:40.538
COUNT.

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:42.340
THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.242
US TO GET MORE MONEY FOR

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.444

OUR MONEY FOR HOMELESS YOUTH

00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:49.714
EITHER COMES FROM CALLOW YES.

AS A MOTHER OF A SIX YEAR OLD

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.739
WHO'S ONLY WORLD RIGHT NOW IS

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.741
WHERE THE BERRY OF ENTRY TO

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:33.978

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.989
BUT FOR SO MANY POPULATIONS THAT

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.924

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.292
MEN'S CHORUS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.593
TO ME AND MY FAMILY.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.162

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:01.105
FORCE FOR US WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.940

THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.444
AND WE SEE THE CHORUS AS SUCH A

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.779
POWERFUL ARTS ORGANIZATION TO

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.549

SLURS AND DISRESPECT.

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.966
TEEN SUICIDE AMONG THE LGBTQ

THAT GOES PERHAPS TEN YEARS OUT --

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.712

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:50.852
THE OTHER IDEA THAT THE LA --

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:53.054

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:15.676
GOOD CONTROL TO SEE -- HOW WELL

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:20.381

THE LONGER TERM THE IT IS

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.323
IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:30.525
PROBABLY A BIT OF RESOURCES AND

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:32.426
SORT OF BEING STAFFED UP TO BE A

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:33.394
FIFTEEN THAT INFORMATION SO I

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:34.595

DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.276
PEOPLE GO AND WHAT FEELS THEY

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:49.744
EXPAND INTO BUT IN THE NEAR TERM

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.946
WE'RE NOT REALLY RESOURCE TO DO

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.080

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:54.882
OR SET UP TO DO THAT.

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.417
OKAY WHAT I WANT LONG DISCUSSION

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:57.752
BUT I I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL IN

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.220
TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:00.655
ENSURING THAT WHATEVER WE'RE

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:01.889

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.658

THE LONG TERM SO I WOULD BE

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.694
INTERESTED SOME POINT AND

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:07.829
UNDERSTANDING.

BE REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO ADD

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:14.168
THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:15.069
TRANSPARENCY?

MILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S A GREAT

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.399
RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO TO FUND

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.001
THIS -- ULTIMATELY THIS IS --

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.402
THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.670
THE STATE THE COMMUNITY

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:03.971
INCLUDING LOCAL ELECTED

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:05.172
OFFICIALS THE NUMBER OF THE

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.107
LEGISLATURE.

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.375
ON INCLUDING CENTER DOTS AND

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:08.009
REQUIRE AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:10.277
AGUIAR-CURRY -- AND FINALLY THE

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:12.079
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND CINEMA

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.647
HAVE ALSO -- RESOUNDINGLY

01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:15.249
SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL -- THEY

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.318
PASSED A RESOLUTION APRIL FIFTH --

01:34:17.385 --> 01:34:18.352
SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT AND

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:22.990
AUTHORIZING STAFF TO BEGIN WORK

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:23.624
ON THE PLANNING PROCESS AND HER

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:23.991
HERE [inaudible]

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:27.361
OKAY.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:32.266
AND WE HAVE A MOTION LA YOU.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.768
BUT A HUNG CHRISTINE SO WE HAVE

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.469
A FEW COMMENTS -- UNDERSTAND

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:36.504
THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE THE

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:37.805
RESULT OF QUITE AN EXTENSIVE

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:38.439
PROCESS -- BUT THERE ARE SOME

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:39.907
TWEAKS THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:41.142
THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP IMPROVE

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:42.643
SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.378
THIS PROCESS I'M GIVEN THE

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.179
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:47.281
INVOLVED IN REALLY -- THAT THE

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:48.716
FACT IT IS A VERY LARGE PROPERTY

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:49.984
I'M SO THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.552
THAT WE HAVE INCLUDE FIRST --

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.354
LIMITING FUNDING TO NINETEEN

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:55.356
TWENTY SO ON THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:56.190
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:57.725
TO THIS WE WOULD RECOMMEND JUST

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:59.360
FINDING THE NINETEEN TWENTY

01:34:59.427 --> 01:34:59.994
ABOUT HAVING TO COME BACK NEXT

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:00.361
YEAR.

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:02.096
A COUPLE REASONS FOR THIS ONE WE

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:02.963
THINK THAT THERE'S SOME

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.565
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THAN THAT

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:05.866
OUT YOUR COSTS ARE GONNA BE THAT

01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:06.734
WOULD GIVE THE UP THE

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:08.169
LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.837
REEVALUATE THOSE COSTS IN

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:11.105
SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:12.473
AND WE ALSO THINK I'M JUST

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.974
HAVING THEM REPORT BACK AT THAT

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.709
TIME ABOUT THE STATUS OF THAT

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:18.579
PROJECT AND AND THE DISPOSITION

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.247
WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WE CAN

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:22.716
THAT'S A NICE CHECK AND SECONDS --

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:24.318
WE'RE RECOMMENDING HAVING THAT

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:24.985
THE FUNDING FOR CINEMA COUNTY BE

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.954
DONE ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS IN

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.789
PART BECAUSE THE DEAD STATE

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.491
DOESN'T USUALLY -- FUND THIS

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.393
TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND SO -- IT'S

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.727
IT'S DIFFICULT TO VERIFY WITH

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:34.762
CERTAINTY WHETHER THIS IS

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:35.696
EXACTLY RIGHT FUNDING AMOUNTS WE

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:36.997
THINK OF REIMBURSEMENT BASIS

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:39.066
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- THIRD

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:40.434
WERE SUGGESTING -- AN AMENDMENT

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.136
TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE --

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:43.504
THAT COULD FURTHER SPECIFY THE

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:44.872
LEGISLATURE'S GOALS FOR THE

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:47.074
PROPERTY SO CURRENTLY SO --

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.542
ALONG WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.311
THERE'S TRAILER BILL AND THAT'S

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:52.012
PROPOSED WHICH WOULD BASICALLY

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.147
EXEMPT THIS PROPERTY FROM THE

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:54.381
TRADITIONAL SURPLUS PROPERTY

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:56.617
PROCESS WHICH WHICH HAS SORT OF

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.319
A LOADING ORDER FOR THINGS YOU

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.121
KNOW WAYS AT FIRST THAT PROPERTY

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:01.355
IS MADE AVAILABLE.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.057
TO YOU KNOW WHEN USE THAN THE

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:04.024
NEXT AND THE NEXT ON THE TO

01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:04.959
CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:05.626
I'M CERTAINLY THERE'S A

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:07.595
RATIONALE FOR USING AN ALTERNATE

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.463
PROCESS IN THIS IN THIS CASE --

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.365
BUT THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY BROAD

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:12.700
AND IT GIVES QUITE A BIT OF

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:13.567
AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.402
DIRECTOR -- AND TO THE EXTENT

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:16.370
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD MORE

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.072
SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THE PROPERTY

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.073
FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:22.009
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR THE THIS --

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:22.543
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.777
COMMUNITY IT COULD FURTHER

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.713
SPECIFY THOSE -- JUST TO GIVE A

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:33.821
LITTLE BIT MORE -- DIRECTION IF

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.789
IT'S INTERESTED IN DOING.

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.391
AND THEN -- WE'RE ALSO

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.058
RECOMMENDING I MIGHT FIND A

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:38.826
TRAILER BILL.

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:39.460
LOOK LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE SOME

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:40.928
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT -- ONE

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.329
POSSIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE IS TO

01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:43.464
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT I HAD TO

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:44.231
DO A DEAL BE SEATED LEGISLATIVE

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:45.099
BUDGET COMMITTEE NOTIFICATION

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.600
PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO A LONG

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:47.501
TERM LEASE OR THE SALE.

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:48.669
ON THAT WOULD GIVE THE

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.104
LEGISLATURE JUST A CHECK AND SO

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:51.172
I COULD SEE COULD.

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.039
EVALUATE WHETHER.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.407
IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:54.775
PROPOSED APPROACH FOR THE SOUTH.

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:55.843
AND THEN THE FINAL COMMENT WE

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.478
HAD IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.312
CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S

01:36:58.379 --> 01:36:59.346
COMFORTABLE WITH SETTING

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:00.548
POTENTIALLY SETTING A PRECEDENT

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:01.782
ON FOR THIS PROCESS FOR THIS

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.184
PROPERTY SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.218
UNUSUAL.

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:06.854
PROCESS -- IT'S ALSO AN UNUSUAL

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.622
SET AMOUNT OF MONEY AND AND SOME

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:09.223
OF THE THINGS ARE FINDING OUR

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.025
LAW AND USUAL -- AND SO --

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.326
CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:14.395

ALSO THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:22.369
AFFECTED BY THE WILDFIRES.

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.505
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- AND

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:25.706
ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT

01:37:25.773 --> 01:37:26.640
CERTAINLY OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:28.842

CLAIM THAT WAS FILED. THREE FOUR

02:29:38.803 --> 02:29:42.206
FIVE YEARS AGO. ONE I SAY THAT

BUT THEY DIDN'T WIN.

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:51.615
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:54.819
PAID -- AND IT TO BE TREATED

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.954

THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:19.510

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:23.013
SO.

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.683
WHATEVER THAT IS WHATEVER THAT

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:28.886
AMOUNT IS WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:30.888
HOW TO MOVE THAT FORWARD BECAUSE

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:31.922
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T IN GOOD

02:30:31.989 --> 02:30:33.791

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:39.296
EXPECT.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:41.432
IF THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD TO

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:42.967
DO A FILING THE CLAIM THEY

02:30:43.033 --> 02:30:44.835
EXPECT TO BE PAID.

02:30:44.902 --> 02:30:47.405
AND THEN I GETTING PAID.

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:49.507

02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:51.041
THIS LEVEL OF WAGE THAT IS

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:52.309

02:38:18.555 --> 02:38:19.623
WHAT I MEAN?

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:22.092
SERIOUSLY THIS IS THIS JUST

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:24.595
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND AND I I I

02:38:24.661 --> 02:38:26.029
RESPECT WOULD YOU SAY THAT

02:38:26.096 --> 02:38:26.463
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:28.232
COLLABORATIVE IN ALL THIS UT

02:38:28.298 --> 02:38:29.566
THAT'S NOT WORKING.

02:38:29.633 --> 02:38:31.869
AND AND A WHAT IS IT GOING TO

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:32.603

WOULD THEY WILL HAVE A BACKLOG

02:38:38.308 --> 02:38:39.643
OR SOMETHING IS GOING ON THAT'S

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:41.478
TAKING LONGER FAST FOR MORE

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:44.081
STAFF DOES WERE RESOURCES WE'VE

02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:45.849
BEEN DOING THIS FOR MONTHS NOW.

02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:48.085
TAKING UP REQUEST. FOR MORE

02:38:48.151 --> 02:38:50.821
STAFFING MORE RESOURCES WHAT IS

IT GONNA TAKE.

02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:56.326
AND HERE I HONESTLY I CANNOT

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:59.129
DEFEND THE TIME THAT THEY TOOK

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:03.600
FROM. 200-011-22000 AND SIXTEEN

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:06.236
WE COULD TO MOVE TO TO BEGIN TO

02:39:06.303 --> 02:39:09.439
TAKE ACTION ON THESE REGULATIONS

02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:10.641
I KNOW ALL THAT.

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:12.809
EXHAUSTIVE MEETINGS WERE HER OR

02:39:12.876 --> 02:39:15.879
HELD BUT FRANKLY I JUST I'M I'M

02:39:15.946 --> 02:39:17.214
BEING AS HONEST IN THIS

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:19.583
TRANSPARENT AND CANDID AS I CAN.

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:22.686
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I

02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:24.221
DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED.

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:26.356
THE DELAY ALL I CAN SPEAK TO

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:28.659
GOING FORWARD IS WHAT WE ARE

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:30.093
DOING NOW AND PROVIDE THE

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:31.962
DEPARTMENT'S ASSURANCE THAT WE

02:39:32.029 --> 02:39:35.499
ARE WORKING AS EXPEDITIOUSLY.

02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:36.867
AS WE CAN.

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:39.403
YES AND JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT --

02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:44.308
THIS REGULATION I HAS AN

02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:45.242
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:47.511
TRIGGERS THE THE THE

02:39:47.577 --> 02:39:48.812
STANDARDIZED REGULATION IMPACT

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:51.281
ANALYSIS THE SHARIA AND SO THAT

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:54.117
CERTAIN THE REQUIRES A YOU KNOW

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:57.020
DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:59.256
AND AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:00.190
RECEIVED A DROP OF THE YEAR OF

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:01.925
THE I. R. SRI -- WE'VE EEN

02:40:01.992 --> 02:40:03.393
WORKING WITH THEM SINCE WE'VE

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.395
MOVED OUT MANY OF THE CONCERNS

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:07.130
AND I THINK AT THIS POINT.

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:09.032
ADD THE REGULATION SHOULD BE

02:40:09.099 --> 02:40:11.501
READY BY MID -- TWENTY TWENTY AS

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:13.570
AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE

02:40:13.637 --> 02:40:17.074
UPDATED DROPS WITH ALL OF OUR

02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:18.608
WOULD BE UPDATED TRAPS BUT WE'RE

02:40:18.675 --> 02:40:19.643
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO

02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:21.611
RECEIVING A AND AND MOVING THIS

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:24.581
REGULATION ALONG AND AND YES.

02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:26.116
SO WHY WOULD DO IT WOULD HAVE TO

02:40:26.183 --> 02:40:28.185
TAKE ANOTHER YEAR PLUS IF THE IT

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:35.525
IF I MAY SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION --

02:40:35.592 --> 02:40:37.494
THE THE APPROVAL PROCESS UNDER

02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:38.795
THE ADMINISTRATIVE -- OFFICE OF

02:40:38.862 --> 02:40:39.997
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW MAY TAKE UP

02:40:40.063 --> 02:40:41.164
TO A YEAR THIS IS A MAJOR

02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:42.432
REGULATION.

02:40:42.499 --> 02:40:43.934
IT IS POSSIBLE WHEN I CAN'T

02:40:44.001 --> 02:40:45.068
PROMISE ANYTHING BECAUSE WHEN I

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:47.104
AM CONTROL THAT PROCESS BUT IF

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:49.006
THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE ITS WORK

02:40:49.072 --> 02:40:51.575
WELL IF THOSE MEETINGS.

02:40:51.641 --> 02:40:53.443
STAKEHOLDERS MEETINGS THAT TOOK

02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:56.146
PLACE RECEIVED A THAT INPUT FROM

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:58.982
THE COMMUNITY IF THIS PACKAGE IS

02:40:59.049 --> 02:41:01.485
REFLECTIVE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

02:41:01.551 --> 02:41:03.487
THE PACKAGE COULD MOVE MUCH MORE

02:41:03.553 --> 02:41:04.554
QUICKLY THAN THAT.

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.089
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I CAN'T

02:41:06.156 --> 02:41:07.791
PROVIDING ASSURANCE OF THAT THE

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:09.126
ONE THING I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS

02:41:09.192 --> 02:41:11.595
PACKAGE GOALS BEYOND JUST THE

02:41:11.661 --> 02:41:14.431
PALE LIMIT. TO ALSO THE ACTION

02:41:14.498 --> 02:41:16.166
LEVEL WHICH IS ANOTHER LAYER OF

02:41:16.233 --> 02:41:19.036
PROTECTION SO IT REVISES.

02:41:19.102 --> 02:41:21.405
OF THE PILL LIMITS AS THE

02:41:21.471 --> 02:41:23.707
GENTLEMAN HAS COMENTED ON BUT

02:41:23.774 --> 02:41:25.876
IT GOES BEYOND -- THOSE SPELL

02:41:25.942 --> 02:41:27.210
LIMITS IT IS A STRONGER

02:41:27.277 --> 02:41:29.546
PROTECTION THAN CHEST REVISING

02:41:29.613 --> 02:41:31.048
THE PALE LIMITS A LOT.

02:41:31.114 --> 02:41:32.115
AND SO I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I

02:41:32.182 --> 02:41:33.617
CAN'T SPEAK TO THEM ANYMORE THAN

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:36.219
I ALREADY HAVE -- BUT WE'RE

02:41:36.286 --> 02:41:41.525
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE PROCESS

02:41:41.591 --> 02:41:43.293
WILL NOT TAKE A YEAR BUT TO MR

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.194
HIM IN THIS IS POINT.

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:45.862
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL IF IF WE ARE

02:41:45.929 --> 02:41:47.998
REQUIRED.

02:41:48.065 --> 02:41:49.833
COULD GOAL THROUGH THE OFFICE OF

02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:53.003
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TWO IN ACTED

02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:54.971
THIS REGULATION.

02:41:55.038 --> 02:41:56.706
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THE

02:41:56.773 --> 02:42:00.077
PROCESS TAKES A YEAR.

02:42:00.143 --> 02:42:02.045
THE SERVER MAY.

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:03.113
YOU KNOW THE FACT THE MATTER IS

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:05.282
IF THERE IS A HECK UP IN THE

02:42:05.348 --> 02:42:06.349
PROCESS.

02:42:06.416 --> 02:42:07.951
IF IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:10.787
FOUND THAT THERE'S THEY HAVE TO

02:42:10.854 --> 02:42:11.888
GO THROUGH CERTAIN STEPS TO

02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:13.757
ACQUIRE AND GET THE REGULATION

02:42:13.824 --> 02:42:16.359
IN PLACE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

02:42:16.426 --> 02:42:17.727
THAT AT SOME POINT.

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:19.096
SOMEBODY WOULD COME UP IN FLAG

02:42:19.162 --> 02:42:21.198
THAT UP AND SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:42:21.264 --> 02:42:21.832
TRYING TO GET THIS AS SOON AS

02:42:21.898 --> 02:42:24.067
POSSIBLE BUT WE'RE HAVING TO DO

02:42:24.134 --> 02:42:25.635
WITH THIS OR THE OTHER.

02:42:25.702 --> 02:42:26.903
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING

02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:29.339
ON THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I'M

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:30.373
HERE BEFORE YOU.

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.275
BECAUSE IF IT'S IF IT'S A MATTER

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.343
OF THE TYPICAL GOVERNMENT SLOW

02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:35.278
DOWN AS WITH HER FOR THE PRIOR

02:42:35.345 --> 02:42:35.612
PRESENTATION.

02:42:35.679 --> 02:42:36.947
THEN.

02:42:37.013 --> 02:42:38.215
YOU KNOW AT LEAST SOMEBODY GO

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:39.116
AND START.

02:42:39.182 --> 02:42:40.684
FLAGGING IT TO YOU ON THE

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:42.486
LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO

02:42:42.552 --> 02:42:43.720
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS.

02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:47.858
AND THESE PEOPLE IN MANY CASES.

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:50.393
RELEASE MY EMPLOYERS WE MONITOR

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.497
THEM WE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:56.733
EMPLOYERS ARE ARE MONITORING THE

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.635
EXPOSURE LEVELS.

02:42:58.702 --> 02:42:59.569
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE THAT HAVE

02:42:59.636 --> 02:43:02.105
BEEN NO REPRESENTATION THAT HAD

02:43:02.172 --> 02:43:03.640
DO NOT HAVE AN OVERSIGHT FROM A

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:05.842
THIRD PARTY FOR EXAMPLE WHAT

02:43:05.909 --> 02:43:07.310
ABSOLUTE?

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:08.745
BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY DIRTY

02:43:08.812 --> 02:43:11.314
TYPE ACTIVITY IT'S A LOWEST PAID

02:43:11.381 --> 02:43:12.549
IN THE INDUSTRY.

02:43:12.616 --> 02:43:14.351
AND IN THE CONSTRUCTION THIS

02:43:14.417 --> 02:43:15.819
RESULT WAS PAID.

02:43:15.886 --> 02:43:17.287
YET THE MOST HAZARDOUS.

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:18.622
SO I WOULD BE OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:43:18.688 --> 02:43:19.823
THAT WHAT THEY COULD MAKES

02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:21.291
COMMITTEES IS GONNA TAKE ONE

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:23.793
MORE YEAR TO THE MINISTRY OF LAW.

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:24.828
I WOULD HOPE THAT BY THE GET

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.463
TIME TO GET TO THAT POINT TO

02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:27.130
THIRTY THERE'S WITH IT IT TAKES

02:43:27.197 --> 02:43:30.433
IN A YEAR AND NOT ANOTHER FIVE

02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:33.703
YEARS.

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:36.840
MR HELLO ANY COMMENTS.

02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:37.440
WELL.

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:38.608
YOU KNOW I THINK THE MOST

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:41.044
DISAPPOINTING PART OF THE FIRST

02:43:41.111 --> 02:43:41.611
IS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S

02:43:41.678 --> 02:43:43.413
TAKEN.

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.783
BUT THERE'S NO PLAN.

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:49.352
REALLY TO EXPEDITE THIS.

02:43:49.419 --> 02:43:51.888
IF I MAY THERE'S NEVER THERE AND

02:43:51.955 --> 02:43:53.957
LISTEN UNDERSTAND BUT AND NO I I

02:43:54.024 --> 02:43:54.558
DON'T THINK YOU'RE

02:43:54.624 --> 02:43:56.693
MISUNDERSTANDING NECESSARILY I

02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:58.228
JUST WONDER [inaudible]

02:43:58.295 --> 02:44:00.931
GENTLY CORRECT WHAT AGES.

02:44:00.997 --> 02:44:03.900
THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO CAPACITY.

02:44:03.967 --> 02:44:05.602
TO ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS FROM

02:44:05.669 --> 02:44:06.903
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE

02:44:06.970 --> 02:44:08.572
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T OWN THE

02:44:08.638 --> 02:44:10.674
PROCESS -- OF THIS HAS TO GO

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:11.675
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:13.643
FINANCE IT HAS TO GO TO THE

02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:14.711
STANDARDS BOARD WHICH IS A

02:44:14.778 --> 02:44:16.713
SEPARATE ENTITY THAT HAS

02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.415
JURISDICTION OVER THIS MATTER IT

02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:19.950
HAS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

02:44:20.016 --> 02:44:24.354
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER. TO

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:25.889
SET THAT PROCESS ASIDE.

02:44:25.956 --> 02:44:27.390
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU SET

02:44:27.457 --> 02:44:29.626
THE PROCESS ASIDE I'M SUGGESTING

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:31.895
THAT YOU HAD THE STAFFING YOU

02:44:31.962 --> 02:44:34.431
COULD MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD I

02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:37.667
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT SO IF

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:41.104
IS STAFF IN AN ISSUE I FINISHED

02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:42.973
LAUGHING WAS AN ISSUE.

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:44.341
I CAN'T SENATE STAFFING IS AN

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:45.175
ISSUE TODAY.

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:46.743
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:50.046
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT.

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:53.016
THE SLOWDOWN OR OF THE INACTION

02:44:53.083 --> 02:44:55.318
WAS IMPACTED BY MANY THINGS I

02:44:55.385 --> 02:44:57.120
DON'T HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF

02:44:57.187 --> 02:45:00.357
THAT -- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DID NOT

02:45:00.423 --> 02:45:03.026
MOVE ON THIS REGULATION AS

02:45:03.093 --> 02:45:04.861
QUICKLY AS WE COULD I DON'T WANT

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:06.596
TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES AT ALL IT'S

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:08.798
CLEAR THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT

02:45:08.865 --> 02:45:11.401
DISPUTE IN ANY WAY.

02:45:11.468 --> 02:45:13.536
THAT IT SHOULD HAVE MOVED FASTER.

02:45:13.603 --> 02:45:14.170
VISUAL SENATOR RESO AND DANIEL

02:45:14.237 --> 02:45:15.171
BRAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:45:15.238 --> 02:45:16.740
FINANCEI JUST WANT TO ADD THAT

02:45:16.806 --> 02:45:18.008
YOU KNOW AS WE IDENTIFIED THERE

02:45:18.074 --> 02:45:19.542
ISN'T THE OFFICE OF

02:45:19.609 --> 02:45:21.111
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROCESS --

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.846
WHICH WE ARE IN NOW SO I DON'T

02:45:22.912 --> 02:45:23.613
BELIEVE THAT STAFFING IS AN

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.015
ISSUE IT D. I. R. IT'S GOING

02:45:25.081 --> 02:45:26.616
