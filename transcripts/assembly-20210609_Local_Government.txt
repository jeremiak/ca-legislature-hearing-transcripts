THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA INTO CONFORMANCE WITH THE EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SEEKING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. DEMAND FOR RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS CLEARLY ELEVATED OUR UNDERSTANDING THE BROADBAND ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATING IN EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN SOCIETY. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM BY CONFORMING WITH CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FCC FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO GIVE ACCESS TO THEIR STREET LIGHTING TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES IN ORDER FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO ATTACH THEIR WIRELESS FACILITIES. THE BILL FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT ACCESS TO THESE POLLS IS PROVIDED AT A NON DISCRIMINATORY COST BASED RATES. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SKEWS ME HOWEVER MANY LOCALITIES THROUGHOUT THE AREA ARE INTERPRETING- IT'S- LET ME START OVER OKAY YEAH SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL CREATE UNIFORMITY WITH THE FCC ORDER BY FIRST OFFERING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE OPTION TO CONFORM TO THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLAR FCC PRESUMPTIVE RATE. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO DO NOT WISH TO APPLY THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLAR RATE THE OPTION TO USE THE COST BASED ATTACHMENT RATE FORMULA IS MODELED AFTER THE E. B. TEN EIGHTY SEVEN PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THAT COST BEFORE IN THIS BEEN USED IN PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES FOR YEARS AND IT'S BEEN APPLIED BY THE CPUC TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS WELL- GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONTINUING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR A COMMITMENT. TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND I ALSO WANT TO ASSURE MEMBERS THAT I WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE BACKS COMMITTEE TO REPORT. TO ADD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT THE STATE GOALS FOR UNIVERSAL BROADBAND ACCESS ARE BEING MET. ON THE PHONE IS BARBARA NEMCO FOR NAPA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN THE HEARING ROOM FOR SUPPORT IS RUDY RADIUS- FROM VERIZON. DATE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- WEIRD OPERATOR PLEASE ADD MISSED THEM CO. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THAT AFTERNOON ON BARBARA. HI I'M BARBARA NEMCO I'VE BEEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND NAPA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND AN EDUCATOR FOR MORE THAN FIFTY. DURING ALL OF THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT DESPITE EXPENDITURES OF LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND A PART OF THE REASON IS WE HAVE NOT HAD THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT WHY IS DIGITAL SO ESSENTIAL WHY IS THAT ESSENTIAL THAT EVERY CHILD HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS. KIDS TODAY CAN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK WITHOUT THAT TO WE SEE CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE STARBUCKS SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET ONLINE. USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WE CAN DO MORE THAN JUST CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE CAN ACCELERATE AND THEN RICH TREATMENT BECAUSE IT GIVES US THE OPTION. OF HAVING CHILDREN LEARN IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE PERSONALIZE IT YOU CAN LEARN THE SKILLS OF MASKED BY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO YOU AND THAT PERHAPS A CAREER AREA THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT ONLINE. ONE FEATURING FRONT OF A CLASSROOM CANNOT PERSONALIZED FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE CLASS BUT DIGITAL ALLOWS US TO DO IT IT IS ALSO MUCH MORE ENGAGING THAN ANY BOOK OR ANY PETER COULD EVER BE. BECAUSE IT RESPONDS THAT YOU ANSWER AND YOU GET FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY THE TEACHER CAN'T GIVE FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY TO EVERY CHILD IN THE ROOM BUT THE COMPUTER CAN FOR WHICH I WAS WORKING ON SOMETHING HE'S INTERESTED IN HE'S GETTING IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK. AND HE CAN GET CORRECTION AND ACCELERATION WHATEVER THIS TEAM NEEDS. USING BROADBAND HAPPENING THAT CHILDREN CAN PARTICIPATE IN REAL WORLD RESEARCH STUDIES BEING. CONDUCTED AT UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THEY CAN PUT IN THEIR DATA ONLINE AND THAT CAN BECOME PART OF THE RESEARCH STUDY IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT THE HOME OF SILICON VALLEY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE BROADBAND FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE AND FOR EVERY FAMILY IN THE STATE. I URGE YOU. TO PLEASE DON'T ASK. ME SURE IT'S TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DO. WITHOUT THE- YOU'LL TO PASS TO BE US THE- NOW I URGE YOU TO DO I OR THE COR TO OF DISPEL.

IN CALIFORNIA. SENATOR WE'VE APPLIED SENATOR DODD FOR CHAMPIONING THIS BILL SENATE ARE LAID OUT WHAT THE BILL DOES I THINK VERY CLEARLY LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT DOES NOT DO- SO-FIRST OFF THIS DOES NOT IMPACT LOCAL CONTROL. OVER THE SIDING REPLACEMENT OR STATICS OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES PLACEMENTS. THE I AGREE THAT THOSE ISSUES SHOULD BE HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL THIS DECISION DOES IS. IMPLEMENTED AND PROVIDE A REMEDY AND PROCESS FOR THE FCC TWENTY EIGHTEEN DECISION- THE BILL ALSO HAS A GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE THAT PRESERVES EXISTING AGREEMENTS SO THE WAY I EXPLAIN IT IS. NEW POLLS NEW RATE ALL POLLS HOLD RATE IT'S PRETTY IT'S THAT SIMPLE IT ALSO PRESERVES THE OF THE ABILITY OF THE CARRIERS TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL CITIES ON PARTNERSHIPS ARE FORWARD LOOKING AGREEMENT. DEFINED A WIN WIN OPPORTUNITIES AS THE INDUSTRY AND I'M PROUD TO SAY VERIZON IS DONE WITH SEVERAL CALIFORNIA CITIES- AND FINALLY- THE BILL PRESERVES THIS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS THANK YOU- SAFE HARBOR THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE SAFE HARBOR RATE THAT THE FCC HAS IN CASE THE CITY. DOES NOT HAVE- THE DESIRE TO DO THEIR OWN COST ID THEY CAN USE THE SAME FCC SAFE HARBOR RATE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THE CHAIR AND SENATOR WOULD ALLOW. WOULD WOULD LIKE THANK YOU.

A PAUL MCGAVIN FROM WHERE CALIFORNIA THAN FRANK ERA SAVE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA WILL BE ON THE PHONE SO WE WILL START WITH MR GRAMM PLEASE. GIVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN MOST DISTINGUISHED HONORABLE MEMBERS MARK GRAHAM ON BEHALF OF KEEP CELL ANTENNAS AWAY. PLEASE ASK ME QUESTIONS AFTER MY PRESENTATION. WHAT MR REYES MENTIONED THE PRESERVING EXISTING AGREEMENTS AND PRESERVING A STATIC REGULATIONS IS NOT IN THIS BILL BUT IT MUST BE PUT INTO THIS BILL AND YOU SHOULD DO THAT TODAY THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN IN SB FIVE FIVE SIX IS SIMPLY BAD POLICY OVER POWERED CELL ANTENNAS CONSTRUCTED TEN TO FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM ALREADY SERVE HOMES WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DISTANCE LEARNING TELEHEALTH FOR CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED LOWER INCOME AREAS CANNOT AFFORD THE MUCH TOO HIGH PRICES FOR BROADBAND WHAT IS NEEDED IS JUST AND REASONABLE PRICING FROM TITLE TO REGULATED WIRED INTERNET FROM STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES. ACCORDING TO A REPORT LAST APRIL FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ANNENBERG SCHOOL FOR COMMUNICATION THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IT'S A PRICE ISSUE. THERE'S NOTHING SB FIVE FIVE SIX THAT ADDRESSES AND USER AFFORDABILITY OR REQUIRES JUST AND REASONABLE PRICING. THE BILL IS ALSO VAGUE ON CERTAIN AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL SECTION FIVE NINE EIGHT ONE A SAYS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY SHALL NOT ON REASONABLY. DENY THE LEASING OR LICENSING OF ITS STREETLIGHT POLE TO TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLL FOR SELLING TEMAS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. IS IT REASONABLE FOR A CITY TO DENY ACCESS CITING FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL AND STATE APPELLATE COURT OPINIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING T. MOBILE THE SAN FRANCISCO SAID THE CITY HAS THE POWER TO SET AESTHETIC REGULATIONS. TO PRESERVE THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF THE STREETS AND OTHER LOCAL VALUES IS THAT REASONABLE YES. AS RECENTLY CONFIRMED BY THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT UNDER FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REGULATIONS CITIES RETAIN LOCAL AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE REASONABLE A FEW. SECONDS ON TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS FACILITIES THIRTY PORTLAND VERSUS UNITED STATES. CANNOT CITY SITE VAST AND DENY ACCESS. SELLING KIND OF ONE OF HOMES ARE NEVER THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS TO PROVIDE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. A VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN LAW USUALLY WORKS AGAINST THE CITY THE COUNTY AND THE PEOPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GRAMM URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB FIVE FIVE SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. ANNOUNCED MISTER MCGAVIN. AND MR GALVIN WELCOME. WELL YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

THIS IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO DO IS WE'RE CONTINUING BEING TORTURED AND FORCED TO MOVE DUE TO EXCESSIVE POWER THROUGH THE AIR BY BIG WIRELESS. COMPANIES WHO ARE BAMBOOZLING YOU INTO ACCEPTING WIRELESS BROADBAND AS A SOLUTION TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THEY HAVE NO PREEMPTION FOR WIRELESS BROADBAND ONLY FOR WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT NEWS FLASH WIRELESS WELL DO IT THESE BILLS ARE WORSE INDUSTRY TRIP OF THE PLAY FOR TWO DECADES WRAP THEIR BUSINESS GOALS AROUND A CURRENT MEAN.

I AM FRANK OBSTINATE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT ABOUT. ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS BECAUSE THE IDEA TO BY THE POLLS SB FIVE BY SIX. THIS BILL WOULD REPORTER PUBLIC SAFETY BY CREATING SHORT PROVIDING DEADLINES CANADA GIVEAWAY TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY ON THE BACKS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ALL WHILE DOING NOTHING TO HOLD INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE SB FIVE BY SIX COULD TAKE OVERLY STRICT TIMELINES AND LIMIT THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLECT THREE. THIS IS A SWEET HEART GIVEAWAY TO THE INDUSTRY AND FAVORED THE INDUSTRY'S BOTTOM LINE OVERTAKE PEOPLE WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC THE FULL REVIEW OF PERMIT APPLICATIONS. THE W. I HAVE STUDIED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND IT'S FOUND THAT TO REVIEW IT'S CRUCIAL FOR STATES ARE ALREADY WAS CRUCIAL FOR SAFETY. UNFORTUNATELY SB FIVE FIVE SIX MAKES PERMITTING PROCESS WORSE FOR WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC THANK PUBLIC SHORTEN TIMEFRAMES WOULD TIE THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DURING THE REVIEW. LOCAL MEMORY KEY TO HELP TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT INFLATION THE CONDUCTOR BASICALLY BY PROPERLY TRAINED WORKERS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SUBCONTRACTORS DON'T ENDANGER THE PUBLIC OR OTHER WORKERS. ON THE RIGHT AWAY BIGELOW CONTRIBUTED REPORT PUBLISHED IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFICERS AND ADVISORS THE BIG HELP ALONG WITH THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH UNFAIR APPLICATION TIMELINE COULD RESTRICTIVE TREATS. LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED BY SB FIVE BY SIX FOR EXAMPLE THE REPORT PARK THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SURVEY REPORT THAT PROVIDERS REGULARLY PROVIDE INPUT COMPLETE APPLICATIONS. NOTHING IN THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE FAILURE OF APPLICANTS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE PENALTIES THAT WILL NOT BY. REPORT ALSO DETAILS OVER 50% OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONDED TO REPORTS THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS DOLLARS CAUSED DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY AND OR FAILED TO PROPERLY STORE PUBLIC PROPERTY. OFTEN IN THE SITUATION ITS LOCAL TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PICK UP THE TAB NOTHING ELECTRIFIED BY TICKS REQUIRED TO PROPERLY TRAINED WORK FORCE TO CONDUCT THE INSTALLATION.

AND NONE OF WHICH HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER NOW FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN I'M NOT SURE- THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT CITIES. HAVE YOU KNOW. EITHER READ OR UNDERSTOOD THE AMENDMENTS THAT FRANKLY THIS BILL NOW- COMPARED TO PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF SOMETHING- THAT WAS TRIED UP LIKE THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO- GIVES WAY MORE- DISCRETION TO- YOU KNOW TO THE CITIES. WE CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THAT'S BEEN MY POINT OF CONTACT I'VE GOT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP- WITH- AND I MEET WITH THEM- YEAH. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO DISCUSS IT MOST OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES RECENTLY IS ABOUT EQUITY. AND WE THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE RIGHT IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHEN WE TALK TO THEM THEIR MAJOR CONCERN AT THE TIME IT MAY NOT BE IT MAY BE DIFFERENT TODAY. I HEARD THEM ON THE PHONE WITH EQUITY AND- WE BELIEVE THAT WILL HAVE A REALLY IMPRESSIVE- A MEMBER TO THE NEXT GUY COMMITTEE HEARING IS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH SO I. AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT- ENOUGH FOR THE CITY'S BEING ALL TO CAN TO DIE. WELL I'M WITH CITY IS WELL AS THERE PRODUCTS CONCERNS ALSO WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE AMENDMENTS AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- WITH YOUR PERMISSION. COULD WE HAVE ONE OF THE TECHIES COME UP. RISE IN PERSON- PLEASE SIR MR RAYOS WHICH LIKE HIM TO COME UP THERE YES. RIGHT CALIFORNIA. YEAH YOU GOTTA MYSTERIES MAY IT PLEASE THE CHAIR YES OKAY YES HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I HAVE A MILITARY ELECTRONICS BACKGROUND IN FACT I WAS A RETIREMENT SO THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE IN THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT BUT FIRST A PARTICULAR REASON. FIVE GMI AND IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING I'M ABOUT TO SAY JUMP RIGHT IN OKAY YES I MAKE SURE I HAVE MY HEAD WRAPPED AROUND THIS BILL BECAUSE I'D LIKE THE BILL IT'S A GOOD ONE THANK YOU SIR AND THE REASON IT'S A GOOD ONE IS. FIVE G. IS DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHER CELLULAR PLANS FIVE G. IS A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH THIS IS A GREAT LEAP FORWARD I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SIX GB. THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT IT MEETS THE SAME SAFETY STANDARDS IS EQUIPMENT USED IN CURRENT NETWORKS CORRECT YES SIR. ROGER THAT. AND THIS IS A UNIQUE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S MADE UP OF HUNDREDS OF VERY SMALL ANTENNA THEY'RE IN A REYES TO MAXIMIZE SIGNALS AND THAT RESULTS IN VERY LOW RADIO WAVE EXPOSURE CALL BEING FOR ME IS THAT CORRECT. YES SIR. GOOD EXPOSURE LEVELS WOULD BE BELOW INTERNATIONAL SAFETY LIMITS WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO FIVE GIGAHERTZ. AND ABOVE. IT THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE INTERNATIONAL SAFETY LIMITS IS THERE. THERE MOST STRINGENT IS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WE'RE BELOW THE EUROPEAN UNION THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT FOR SAFETY IS THAT CORRECT WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THAT THE BILL CONFORMS TO THE FCC SAFETY STANDARDS WHICH ARE VERY STRICT YES ALL RIGHT ALSO FROM MY RESEARCH FIVE G. CANNOT PENETRATE WALLS MOST FIVE G. NOT ALL WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR. COULD NOT PENETRATE GLASS SO CELLULAR FIVE G. IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WIFI WIFI GOES THROUGH WALLS AND GO THROUGH YOUR WHOLE HOUSE AND PEOPLE WILL. SIT ON OUR COMPUTERS WITH A WIFI RIGHT NEXT TO NOT EVEN THINKING TWICE ABOUT RF ENERGY. SO I FIND IT KIND OF IRONIC. SO MADAM CHAIR I SEEM TO BE ON THE RIGHT TRACK HERE AS FAR AS THE TECHNICALITIES SO I'M GOOD OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL DOES ANYONE ELSE YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BORA HORMONE. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I THINK FIVE G. IS GOING TO ABSOLUTELY TRANSFORM HOW WE CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER AND WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. THE WORLD AS IT'S GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY I DON'T THINK IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED US ALL TEN YEARS AGO MOVIES SITTING HERE WITH SMARTPHONES AND ALL THE STUFF. YOU KNOW OR MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO FOR TWENTY YEARS AGO WHO WAS SITTING HERE WITH MY PHONE I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ALL MY CITIES OPPOSE YOUR BILL. AND YOU SAID YOU WERE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THEIR OPPOSITION HAS TO DO WITH ACTUALLY THE DETAIL OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CURRENT FEDERAL LAW AND WHAT YOUR BILL IS PROPOSING WHICH IS UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL LAW CITIES DON'T HAVE TO PROPOSE A REMEDY IN YOUR BILL. REQUIRES THEM TO PROPOSE A REMEDY IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO DO IT YES SIR YOU'RE RIGHT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M TELLING. I. SPENT A LOT. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS A LOT OF TRYING TO OUT THE EXACT OPPOSITION A HE SO I. IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE AFFORD BECAUSE I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THIS AND COMMUNICATION COMMAND AND ON THE FLOOR AGAIN- TO WORK OUT. WHAT HAPPENS OF THE CITY DETERMINES THAT THERE'S NO REMEDY. AND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME LINE ESPECIALLY FOR VERY SMALL CITIES. TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT REMEDY VERY SMALL CITIES I DON'T HAVE VERY SMALL CITIES MUCH MORE CITIES SIXTY TWO THOUSAND. THEY PROBABLY HAVE STUFF TO DO IN THE TIME FRAME IS BEING PROPOSED. I THINK SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES WON'T. SO IF YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THAT. AND THE THIRD THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS I THINK AS THIS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT FEDERAL GUIDELINES CAN CHANGE. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR BILL SAYS ABOUT BECAUSE YOUR BILL IS BASICALLY SAYING. WE'RE GONNA DEFINE WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA CORRECT. CORRECT SO AS THAT FEDERAL LAW CHANGES WE DON'T TO BE STUCK WITH A LAW. THAT DOES NOT REFLECT OVER CONSTANTLY COMING BACK HERE TO RE EVALUATE WHAT IT IS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON IF FEDERAL LAW WERE TO CHANGE. AND FIVE MONTHS SIX MONTHS. WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE CAN ACCOMMODATE AND THAT IN YOUR BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME UNFORTUNATELY- IF WE PUT SOMETHING IN STATUTE THAT ROLLED OVER EVERY FEDERAL- CHANGE THE CAME UP A BOARD- WITH IT IN IN FACT. THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY- DECISION MAKING- YOU KNOW FROM THIS BODY IN TERMS OF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED GOING FORWARD SO. ESSENTIALLY IF THERE WAS A BIG CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW THAT REALLY- INTERFERED- WITH WITH THE STATE LAW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- OPINED ON IT WOULD GO THROUGH A DIFFERENT- BILL BUT IT. MISTER REYES HAS ANOTHER COMMENT ON THAT WHICH IS YES YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT SENATOR DODD IS RIGHT IN FACT I THINK THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE. TO SEE. IT BECAUSE IS THIS WITH FEDERAL LAW OVER TIME BUT- WITH RISK. ALLEGE COUNTS IS PUSH BACK EIGHT THAT AS A SEAT OF SAAB. FROM THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OKAY AND THEN MY LAST COLUMN IT WILL BE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I DID SERVE ON THE LEAGUE OF CITIES- HOUSING COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- SUBCOMMITTEE. WHILE THE PREVIOUS BILL WAS GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE SO I REMEMBER ALL THOSE LOVELY CONVERSATIONS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID THEN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER YOU BECAUSE I WILL GET TO SEE THIS AGAIN AGAIN. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRADE US WE NEED TO MAKE. IS IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK CITIES TO TAKE THE EXTRA STEP. AND PROVIDE A REMEDY. THEN THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. THERE SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW FIVE G. AT LIBRARIES AT SCHOOL SITES PARKS. PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WHO EVEN IF THE WHAT FIVE G. DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S NOT PROFITABLE FOR THAT DISTRIBUTION. THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IN THOSE PUBLIC SPACES BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING A PUBLIC BENEFIT. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT BACKSIDE LIKE TO OFFER THAT WITH YOU. I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THESE AMENDMENTS AND HEARING HOW YOUR CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE LEAGUES ARE GOING AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH MY LOCAL CITIES. TO GET US TO A PLACE BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE- THAT THERE'S MORE AGREEMENT THERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE- SO MANY MEMBERS MANY SAYING NONE- YOU KNOW TEN EMOTION. SO SECOND. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION FOR- SOMEONE VOEPEL AFFECT BIASA REMEMBER- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. RIGHT YOU KNOW- CENTER DODD I APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS BILL AND WE ALL KNOW THE PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO EXPAND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN OUR STATE WE ALONG WITH MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE THAT WE HOPE TO CREATE A COMPLETE PICTURE. WHEN WE'RE DONE. ONE WITHOUT ANY HOLES OR BLANK SPACE. WELL WE SHARE THE SCHOOL I ALSO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS A CALL TO DISCUSS TODAY. RIGHT NOW FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU AGREE THAT WE NEED TO FIND REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS OF ACCESS. ADOPTION AFFORDABILITY. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY WITH YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL BE ADOPTING LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE FLOOR. I'D APPRECIATE YOU SHOWING THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE WHEN THE COMMITTEE WITH THE COMMITTEE AS SOON AS YOU CAN- WITH THAT- I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK YOU KNOW THIS IS A PASSION TO ME. BUT THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO COMMUNICATIONS A CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL- HI. AGUIAR-CURRY ALRIGHT LACKEY. LACKEY I BLOOM. WILL NOT BOERNER HORVATH HI BOERNER HORVATH I ROBLES WELL AS I LOSE HI THREE OF US I ROB. ROBERT RIVAS I WILL HI L. R. SEVEN- BILLS HAS OF EVERYBODY SEVEN ZERO OKAY SEVEN BILL OUT LOOKS LIKE A THEY YOU VERY MUCH FIRST- NEXT WEEK MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWO. S. B. TH SO EIGHT. SENATOR GONZALEZ WELCOME. NICE TO SEE YOU TO AND START WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES FOUR AND FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT CLARIFY THE FEE AMOUNT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN CHARGE YOU FIBER INSTALLER FOR A PERMIT TO MICRO TRENCH AND REMOVE REDUNDANT LANGUAGE- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO RESS TO PRESENT SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT. THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IS A KEY COMPONENT TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU ON MANY BROADBAND POLICIES AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE THIS WILL HELP PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY REQUIRING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ALLOW FIBER CABLES TO BE INSTALLED USING COST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING OPEN TRENCHING BORING OR MICRO TRENCHING. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A BEST PRACTICES STANDARD FOR MICRO CHANGING IN RELATION TO DEPLOYING BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY EVERY JURISDICTION IS DOING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT AND WE NEED TO STANDARDIZE THAT STANDARDIZES SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT IS FAST RELIABLE AND LESS INVASIVE. IT'LL ADDRESS THE LACK OF CONTINUITY BY CREATING A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR MICRO TRENCHING AS A DEPLOYMENT OPTION FOR BROADBAND. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE DENNIS WISER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WITH CROWN CASTLE. AS WELL AS ERIKA HOFFMANN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. THINKING I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MCH OPERATOR WE'RE LOOKING FOR DAN SCHWEITZER FROM CROWN CASTLE FOR ERICA HOFFMAN AND WE'RE- TALKINGFROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION BOTH ON THE PHONE. BOTH THEIR OPENERS. HI CHAIR NUMBER USUALLY MAKES ALL OF ON BEHALF OF DAN SCHNEIDER I'D REPRESENT CROWN CASTLE HE ACTUALLY JUST GOT PULLED INTO A MEETING TRYING TO DO A BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT- PROJECT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW BROADBAND PROJECTS TO BE BUILT QUICKER WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING CONSTRUCTION IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. THE BILL ENSURES THAT THE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE OF MICRO TRENCHING IS ALLOWED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO INSTALL HIGH SPEED INTERNET FIBER CABLES UNDERGROUND. MICHAEL CRINGING TECHNOLOGY CUTS A TWO INCH WIDE AND TWO FOOT DEEP TRENCH TO LAY THE FIBER UNDERGROUND. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BACK FILLING AND SEALING. THE ENTIRE PROCESS TAKES HOURS AND CARS CAN DRIVE ON THE ROAD THE SAME DAY. MICRO TRENCHING IS TYPICALLY 60% CHEAPER AND 80% QUICKER THAN TRADITIONAL OPEN FRENCH STREET EXCAVATIONS. WHICH CREATE LANE CLOSURES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED IN LOS ANGELES WERE OVER FORTY MILES OF FIBER. HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN RECENT MONTHS- IS NECESSARY BECAUSE MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HESITANT TO UTILIZE THIS NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT CITY STAFF FOR USED TO THE OLDER MORE DESTRUCTIVE METHOD OF OPEN TRENCHING. MICHAEL TRENCHING COMPLIES WITH ALL UTILITY SAFETY RULES AND GOES FURTHER BY USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR PRIOR TO INSTALLATION. QUICKER INSTALLATION OF FIBER MEANS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE CAN GET CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND DAYS INSTEAD OF MONTHS. THIS WILL COMPLEMENT THE STATE'S EFFORT TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR BROADBAND BY ENSURING THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS ARE MAXIMISED AND BENEFIT RESIDENTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE CAN ENSURE AGUIAR-CURRY AND CENTER GONZALEZ FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON ADVANCING BROADBAND IN THE STATE AN ASTRONAUT VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WILL HAVE ERICA HOFFMAN PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS ERICA HOFFMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION CFTA IS COMMITTED TO BROADBAND EXPANSION IN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IMPROVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS. AT THE LAST YEAR HAS SHOWN NOW MORE THAN EVER THE STATE NEEDS TO DO ALL IT CAN CONNECT OUCH OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SCHOOLS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET WE SUPPORT IT SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IN THE SHORT. THAT THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF MICHAEL TENSION TENSION CAN BE USED TO QUICKLY INSTALL FIBER. FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS THIS BILL WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT BY ALLOWING FIBER TO BE INSTALLED IN HOURS. INSTEAD OF WEEKS AND EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IT WILL BE DISCUSSED BLESSED DISRUPTIVE WITHIN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SCHOOLS RETURN FOR BOTH SUMMER PROGRAMS AND IN THE FALL. EDUCATION OPTIONS WILL BE PROVIDED STUDENTS INCLUDING VIRTUAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND MANY MANY TEACHERS THESE DAYS ARE ESTABLISHING HOMEWORK BASED UPON DIGITAL PLATFORMS. THE BILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL APPROPRIATE EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND WITHOUT ACCESS STUDENTS WILL NOT PROGRESS AND SUCCEED. SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO HELP EXPEDITE BROADBAND ACCESSTO COMMUNITIES IN NEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOT DO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE IN THE IN PERSON HERE. MARK GRAHAM FROM KIT- KEEP CELL ANTENNAS AND PALMA GAVIN FROM WHERE CALIFORNIA IF YOU'D LIKE TO APPROACH THE- MICROPHONE. THREE WE'LL GO BACK AND. AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES THIS TIME LAST TIME YOU THREE WITNESSES OF THE- BOTH OF YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. MADAM CHAIR AND MOST DISTINGUISHED AUDIBLE MEMBERS MARK GRAHAM ON BEHALF OF KEEP CELL ANTENNAS AWAY. THIS BILL IS ANOTHER UNNECESSARY GIVEAWAY TO INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT IS A SUBSIDY EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY CAN CHOOSE THE MANNER OF INSTALLING A SUBSURFACE PIPE OR CONDUIT FOR FIBER OPTIC CABLES. THAT IS GOOD THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY WORKING WHILE THE BILL HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANY PROBLEM IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN GENERAL ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTIONS ARE NOT A GOOD IDEA AND DO NOT WORK WELL. DO YOU KNOW WHAT MICRO TRENCHING AS- THERE'S A DEFINITION IN THIS BILL BUT IT DOES NOT TELL YOU. IT'S DIGGING UP THE STREET LITERALLY. IMAGINE MILES AND MILES OF STREET IN EVERY CITY DOG UP AND ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WILL CREATE. THE BILL SAYS NOTHING ABOUT RESTORING THE CONDITION OF THE STREET TO ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION ONCE THE MICROPHONE AND HIS DOG AND THE CONDUIT IS PLACED. IT SHOULD FURTHER THE CARRIERS MUST BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR SUCH RESTORATION OTHERWISE THE BILL IS A HUGE UNFUNDED MANDATE FORCING THE CITIES TO PAY FOR. THE BILL SAYS MICHAEL FRENCH MEANS A NARAL OPEN EXCAVATION TRENCH. YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW ANY OKAY OPEN EXCAVATION TRENCH UNLESS THE CITY CHOOSES IT WHAT CROWN CASTLE'S TRYING TO SELL YOU IS THE CHEAPEST WAY BUT NOT THE BEST. A MUCH BETTER WAY TO INSTALL CONDUIT IS MENTIONED IN THE BILL BORING A TUNNEL. BORING IS THE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE. BORING DOES NOT TEAR UP THE STREET. BORING INVOLVED SENDING A DIGGING TOOL INTO THE GROUND THEY CAN BE GUIDED REMOTELY CAN TURN LEFT RIGHT UP OR DOWN CAN GO AS FAR UNDERGROUND AS YOU WANTED TO. AND COME UP OUT OF THE GROUND WHERE YOU WANTED TO. THIS IS A FAR SUPERIOR PRACTICE THIS IS WHAT CITIES WANT IT IS NOT TERRIBLE ST OR REQUIRE RESTORATION OTHER THAN. AT THE ENTRY POINT AND EXIT POINT. YOU CAN BORE TUNNEL IN THE EASEMENT THE. PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY ACROSS FRONT YARDS. YOU ALSO INSTALL OPTIC CABLES ABOVE GROUND. SONIC DOT NET IS A PROVIDER THAT'S GIVING THE SERVICE ONE GIGABYTE SPEED UP AND ONE GIGABYTE DOWN FOR FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. THE FIBER OPTIC CABLES GO ABOVE GROUND AND THEY RUN ACROSS UTILITY POLES. IN THE CITIES OF PETALUMA SANTA ROSA AND ALAMEDA AMONG OTHERS. THAT IS A CURRENT REAL WORLD EXAMPLE IN THE STATE SHOULD FOLLOW WHAT. DID YOU ASK THE CITY'S WHAT TYPE OF FIBER INSTALLATION THEY PREFER. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THIS BILL IS YOU'RE GOING TO RUSH YOU'RE GOING TO PREEMPT INTELLIGENT LOCAL PLANNING AND END UP WITH INFERIOR INSTALLATION OF CONDUIT. THE BILL SAYS THE INSTALLATION OF FIBER IS NOT A MUNICIPAL AFFAIR AS THAT TERM IS USED IN SECTION FIVE. ARTICLE ELEVEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHY IS THIS NOT A MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS. THERE'S NO REASON STATED FOR THAT. IT'S AN ARBITRARY DECISION. HAS THIS BEEN TRIED ANYWHERE. HAS IT WORKED. YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE A STATE POLICY ON SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN TRIED EXTENSIVELY AND WORKED WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. THERE WAS NOT ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH MY TEAM. WITH I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE OUR OTHER SPEAKER PLEASE THEN THAT WOULD BE MISTER MCGAVIN. THANK OU CHAIR AGUIAR-CURRY AND THE ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I AM AN EXPERT IN MEASURING AND MITIGATING MICROWAVE RADIATION THERE WAS NO OTHER EXPERT IN THE ROOM HERE YOU ASKED AN ATTORNEY RUDY RAMOS FOR SOME KIND OF TECHNICAL EXPLANATION MR VOEPEL. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT THE SPIN THE ANSWERS REALLY ARE BECAUSE YOU WERE MISLED BY HIM OKAY. LOOK THE TRIPLE THREAT SIX SEVEN EIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS DESTROYED LOCAL CONTROL OVER BOTH FIBER OPTIC INSTALLATIONS WIRED'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S FIVE FIVE SIX FIVE THREE SEVEN THIS ONE AB THREE SEVEN EIGHT. WELL NEARLY FOUR MILLION ELECTRONIC DATA SETS OF CALIFORNIANS OVER SIXTY THOUSAND WORKERS OF CW A NUMBER THREE HUNDRED CITIES OPPOSE THESE BILLS WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE. THE ACTUAL AUTHORS OF THESE BILLS ARE THE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE EXCHANGE COUNCIL THE CTIA THE LOBBYIST FOR CROWN CASTLE EIGHTEEN PM VERIZON. WHO ARE ATTEMPTING A MULLIGAN A DO OVER A REPEAT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEENS VETOED SB SIX FOUR NINE. THIRTY RACES AN ATTORNEY. EXCUSE ARE YOU EXPERT EXCUSE ME PLEASE KEEP ON THE TOPIC OF AND I AM ABSOLUTELY. THE BILL LEADING THE YOU'RE NOT SHE TO GO TO OF THE ISSUES THIS WILL BE VERY MATERIAL TO THE JUDGES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THESE BILLS DUE TO THE DUE PROCESS THERE IS THAT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED ON AB FIVE THREE SEVEN ON APRIL TWENTIETH TO MAY NINETEENTH. AND TODAY WITH THESE BILLS ON JUNE NINTH. LISTEN WHAT DO WE HAVE WE HAVE THESE THREE BILLS AS THE CENTURY SB SIX WERE NOT ON STEROIDS WRAPPED UP IN A BACKWARDS LOOKING COVE IT NINETEEN PAT TINA AND I SHARED OF DIGITAL DIVIDE LIPSTICK APPLY TO THIS COLLECTIVE PIG. THESE BILLS ARE ACTUALLY JUST INJUSTICE AND TYRANNY THAT WILL FURTHER ENRICH MULTI BILLION DOLLAR WIRES COMPANIES AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC SAFETY PRIVACY QUITE ENJOY MYSTERIES RESIDENTS A BUSINESS IS. CLOSEST TO THE SO CALLED SMALL CELLS IN THE WORDS OF THE LATE GREAT YOGI BERRA THIS IS A DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN WE DID THIS FOR YEARS AGO AND THE BILL WAS MERCIFULLY VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN WHO WROTE I BELIEVE THE INTEREST WITH THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE RIGHTS OF WAY. REQUIRES A MORE BALANCED SOLUTION THAN THE ONE ACHIEVED IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL OF THESE BILLS AS WELL. THE BEST SOLUTION TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS TO INSTALL FIBER OPTICS TO THE PREMISES AND THEN PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS TO ALL OF THE FIBER OPTIC CABLES THAT ARE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY THAT'S THE KEY POINT. YOU CANNOT ALLOW PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PUT PUT FIBER IN THE PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCESS TO IT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO HOOK UP TO THE FIBER OPTIC GOODNESS ALLOW THEM TO GET THIS DIRECTLY TO THEIR HOMES AND NOW YOU HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM PLEASE LOOK AT THESE POLLS THEY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. THAT'S MY SERVICE I HAVE THE FROM SONIC DOT NET IT'S AWESOME. SO WHAT DO YOU NEED ANY TITLE TO REGULATED PRICING IN ORDER. VICE I'M SORRY WE CLOSE.

START WHEN YOU'RE READY WE KNOW IT'S A BIG RUSH DOWN THE STAIRS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HERE I PRESENT TíNH ON BEHALF OF PROTEIN TONI ATKINS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TO EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU- TO MADAM CHAIR INTO HER AMAZING STAFF TEAM FOR ALL OF THE NOW SYSTEM WORK ON THIS BILL IN ALWAYS GRATEFUL TO WORK WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR MANY OF YOU I THIS BILL WILL LOOK REALLY FAMILIAR OF THE PROTEIN DID AUTHOR I. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY LAST YEAR. WE TOOK A GOOD BILL THAT MET THE FATE OF A HARD DEADLINE AND AFTER LISTENING TO REALLY CRITICAL FEEDBACK FROM HOMEOWNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE IMPROVED. NOW SB NINE PROMOTES SMALL SCALE SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS. IT STREAMLINES THE PROCESS FOR A HOMEOWNER TO CREATE A DUPLEXER SURVIVE SUBDIVIDE IN EXISTING LOT IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS UP TO FOUR UNITS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR UNITS. SB NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL IN CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL SCALE. NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT THAT WE SO BADLY NEED TO BE A CONTACT THEIR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE THAT HOUSING CRISIS EVEN WORSE WE NEED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES EACH AND EVERY YEAR FOR DEVELOPING ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND AND IN THE LA REGION ALONE OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE LA REGION NEEDS ABOUT ONE POINT THREE FOUR MILLION HOUSING UNITS. NOW ONE MODIFICATION- IN THE BILL THIS YEAR. IT THAT THE BILL PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO ENACT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. WE'VE HEARD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR WHICH IS WHY PRO TO MACINNES ADVANCE THAT AMENDMENT AND IT IS DOWN THE BILL. ANOTHER AMENDMENT MADE CLEAR AT THE NUMBER OF UNITS ALLOWED. IN AT THE RISK MADAM CHAIR OF SOUNDING LIKE A BROKEN RECORD I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. UP TO FOUR UNITS ARE ALLOWED NOT TO EXCEED THOSE FOR UNITS. I NOT FIVE NOT SIX FOUR. NOW YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP WITH THIS BILL. IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME BY JD U. N. EIGHTY YOU YOU CAN'T PUT ANOTHER FOUR UNITS ON. THE PROPERTY YOU CAN ONLY DO THOSE THREE YOU CAN'T PUT ANOTHER FOUR ON THERE. NOW THIS BILL IS ALSO OPTIONAL FOR HOMEOWNERS. THIS BILL MERELY OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMEOWNERS TO ADVANCE WORK FORCE HOUSING. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY TO SOME WHO ARGUE THAT THIS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE LOOK OF IN FEEL OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD- IF WE LOOK AROUND US. THERE ARE ALREADY BEAUTIFUL DUPLEXES AND EIGHTY USE NEXT ORDER TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND IN SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST SOUGHT AFTER ZIP CODES THEY'VE ALREADY ADVANCED. THIS TYPE OF LOCAL LAW. EITHER CHARMING HOUSES AND THEY'RE NOT ONLY A BRIGHT SPOT ON THE BLOCK FOR JUST ONE FAMILY. BUT ALSO COMFORTABLE PLACE FOR TWO FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO CALL HOME. ALONG WITH THE SAFEGUARDS IN THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO VERY QUICKLY MADAM CHAIR I IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITY THIS BILL PROVIDES. FAMILIES AND SENIORS TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING AND BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH. INTERGENDER WEALTH REALLY IS A CURRENCY THAT WE KNOW IS CRUCIAL TO COUNTERING INEQUITY. IN CREATING MORE SOCIAL MOBILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY NEIGHBORHOODS WERE OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN OF LEAD TO OVERCROWDING. NOW THIS LEGISLATION PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS WITH OPTIONS TO PROVIDE. REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE OR WHO MAY BE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN PATH TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT ALSO PROVIDES A CHANCE FOR ADULT KIDS. TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GREW UP THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. ERIC AND I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH OR TO HAVE AN AGING PAENT LIVE NEXT DOOR TO YOU. THIS BILL IS AN EXPANSION OF. OPPORTUNITIES THAT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE HOMEOWNERS RENTERS AS WELL AS FAMILIES ALIKE. NOW THIS HOUSING CRISIS IS SO GOING TO BE A SINGLE SOLUTION OR SILVER BULLET TO SOLVE IT OVERNIGHT. BUT SB NINE IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE TO OUR HOUSING PUZZLE. THE BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE CHANGE ANDSTRENGTHENS THE FABRIC OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EQUITY. INCLUSIVITY AS WELL AS AFFORDABILITY. MEDICARE WE HAVE TO LEAD WITNESSES IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU. TAMI NEUMANN WITH UNITED WAY OLE.

WE KNOW THAT PLANETS POLICIES ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER IT AND RACIAL SEGREGATION. WELL DISPARITIES FOR. IT IN L. A. COUNTY. EXACTLY AND YES. THAT THE AFRICAN.

PLEASE IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU CENTER THAT'S GREAT NO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AGREE THANK YOU OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR ENABLING YEAH REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND WE'RE PLEASED TO JOIN SENATE PRO TEM ACTIONS AND STATE SENATOR MCGUIRE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY CONTINUE TO BE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CAUSES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS SOME OF WHICH PLANNERS HAVE CREATED YOU PLAY A PART. UNDER CURRENT LAW A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING. LIMIT HOUSING SUPPLY AND EXCLUDES LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FROM HOUSING WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT SB NINE CAN BE PART OF AN EFFORT TO EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE. SB NINE DOES NOT PROHIBIT SINGLE FAMILY HOME OR DOWNEY ASSEMBLY PROVIDE BUT IN SUCH AREAS PROPERTY OWNERS MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE SMALL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OPTIONS. SB NINE CREATES A BY RIGHT MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO TO FOUR HOMES AND SINGLE FAMILY ITSELF. IT ALLOWS PERSONAL MAPS TO CREATE TWO LOT TERM ONE AND PERMITS UP AT MOM A LOT. YOU ARE AT. TO UNITS EACH FACT THAT. AB A LOT ALREADY ALLOW THE CAR REQUIRES ALREADY ALLOWS UP THREE IN A HELLO. SO THIS REALLY ISN'T. CHANGE BUT THE KEY IS THE PERSONAL MATTER. ALLOW NEW HOME TO BE WHICH HELP CREE HARMONY OP. NOT AND THEY UNDER OTHER HOUSE PRODUCTION BILLS. AND ALTHOUGH THE APPROVAL. IS MINISTERIAL THE MAJORITY OF OBJECTIVE MANY STANDARDS WILL STILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO NEW DEVELOPMENT. BUT THERE'S A SECRET EXEMPTION TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS. THIS APPROACH HELPS BALANCE THE STATE AND LOCAL INTERESTS SB NINE DEFINES MINIMUM PERFORMANCE TARGETS BUT IT LEAVES ROOM FOR LOCAL PLANNERS TO DEFINE AND APPLY CONTACT. THE CIVIC CENTER. FIND OUR HOPE IS THAT INCREASING HOUSING TO NOTHING FAMILY. WILL MAKE. COMMUNITIES MARK THIS BUT WE ALSO THAT NOT COME AT THE COST OF YOUR- FIFTEEN HEARD. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE BILL STATE TO PREVENT A LOT OF EXIT HOUSE AND THE- DISPLACEMENT OF HONORABLE. AT CALIFORNIA. DOWNING REFORM END FACTORS OF REQUIRING ONLY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ON THE MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL LAND. WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR CAN WE SEE. IF WE CAN GET MISTER NEWMAN BACK ON. THANK YOU. IN OUR- THE LOWER CAPE FEAR. MANAGER BACK WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER NEWMAN WHAT YOU START OF. BOCANEGRA I DO HAVE A BIT OF AN ACT ON ONLY THAN ONE THOUGHT I PROMISE. THE. BUT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. HOW'S THAT THAT'S BETTER AT LEAST THAT'S MUCH BETTER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS TOMMY EVAN AND I HOPE TO BE A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WORK AT THE UNITED WAY OF GREATER LA- TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT. ALL ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE DRIVEN RACIAL SEGREGATION AND WEALTH DISPARITIES FOR DECADES IN L. A. COUNTY THE AVERAGE BLACK FAMILY HAS ONE NINETY OF THE WEALTH OF THE AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY HAS AND THE SHAMEFUL WE KNOW THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS DRIVING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEARING THE BURDEN. SB NINE WILL HELP TO INCREASE ACCESS. TO HOUSING ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES IN A DRIVEN THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITE HOUSEHOLDS AND BLACK AND BROWN HOUSEHOLD. I DO NOT EXPECT THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT TO BENEFIT THE BROADER COMMUNITY. OF COURSE HAVE BEEN AND WILL NOT FALL OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ON ITS OWN AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS. INCLUDING RENTER PROTECTIONS AN INCREASE IN PUBLIC FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT HOUSING FOR WORKING AMERICAN PEOPLE. UNITED WAY OF GREATER LA STANDS WHAT LEADERS WERE WILLING TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO AND VISION A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS A SAFE AND STABLE HOME WITH THE ABILITY TO THRIVE. THANK YOU TO A PART TIME ACTION FOR THE COURAGE TO INTRODUCE A MOVE THIS BILL AND THANK EACH OF YOU WHO IS WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER NEWMAN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I HAVE TO IN A POSITION ONE IS RAN MARTIN. I BELIEVE HIM FROM AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. WHO'S HERE I BELIEVE. AS WELL AS WE HAVE BOB BLOCK OF PACHINKO. MAYOR PRO TEM CONCEIVED DOWNEY WIL BE ON THE PHONE SO MISTER MARTIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND IT'S HEALTHY HOUSING FOUNDATION- WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS HERE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE VERY DEEP CONCERN. WHAT WITH THIS BILL AND MANY OF THE BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IS THE LACK OF ATTENTION IS BEING PAYS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST CHALLENGED BY THIS HOUSING CRISIS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREMELY LOW VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE BELOW FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME- AND WE NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THOSE PEOPLE IF WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE WHERE THE PROBLEM REALLY LIES- DOES STUDY THAT CAME OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. INDICATES THAT THE MIDDLE- THE MODERATE INCOME FOLKS IN ABOVE MODERATE INCOME BOOKS IS NOT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE LOWEST INCOME. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT. A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT DEVELOPERS AND OTHERS WILL GO INTO IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. AND IT IS THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MORE LOW INCOME WITH- WITH THE HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR WHO WHO HAVE ACHIEVED SOME OF THE AMERICAN DREAM- WITH HOMEOWNERSHIP- WILL BE A WILL BE. COERCED OR CAJOLED OR BOT OUT OF THOSE- AND FORCED TO MOVE TO PLACES WHERE THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE- AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED OR AT LEAST. ARE PROVIDED SOME- SOME PROTECTIONS AS THEY LEAVE LEAVE THOSE HOMES- WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE RENTAL RELOCATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT- THE THIRD THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THE BILL DOES INCLUDE SOME PROTECTIONS- RELATIVE TO RENT CONTROLLED OR RENT RESTRICTED PROPERTIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS APPLY TO- RENTAL UNITS APARTMENTS ETCETERA IT DOES NOT APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES COSTA HAWKINS- RENTAL ACT A RENTAL HOUSING ACT DOES NOT INCLUDE SMALL- SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND SO THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THE BILL. ACTUALLY DON'T EXIST- FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE IN THIS BILL I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AS A MATTER OF PERFECT. PERFECT TIMING THE ARTICLE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SACRAMENTO BEE THIS MORNING- THE TALKS ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE COLLECTIVELY AND- OF DEAL. WITH THIS- I THINK THE PROGRESS CAN BE MADE IF ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY WILL WORK TOWARDS. FINDING THE SOLUTIONS THAT AFFECT THE- THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE PEOPLE HO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY BY THIS CRISIS. AND NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS- BY GOING INTO INTO EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE- AND CREATING A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN NO LONGER LIVE THERE. WE THANK YOU UP FOR THAT TIM AND I. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MARTIN WILL GO TO BLOCK A PACHINKO. ON THE PHONE PLEASE. I'M NOT SURE THIS IS IT JUST LIABILITY CALIFORNIA CITY UNFORTUNATELY- MAYOR PRO TEMP CZECHO HAD TO LEAVE AT THREE PM TO CHAIRED MEDIA PER CITY I DISAGREE WITH YOUR MANAGER MAY I PRESENT THIS CITY'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. NOT BE FINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU KNOW CHRIS WALLACE TO BEGIN BUT YOU'RE THINKING FEDERAL WIRED WAS PRESENTATION AND CENTER PRO ATKINS. PRAMAC INSERT FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HER AND HER STAFF AND APPRECIATE ALL OF THE MEETINGS WITH THAT- UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME TO RESOLUTIONS ON SEVERAL PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE- HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED- SB NINE WOULD REQUIRE CITIES TO MINISTERIAL APPROVED- LOCKS PUT. AND ALSO THE CREATION OF TWO RESIDENTIAL UNITS ON EACH LOT- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MINISTERIAL APPROVAL I MEAN THAT MEANS WITHOUT CONDITION WITHOUT DISCRETION NO PUBLIC INPUT. AND NO SEE WHAT- WHAT WE FEEL AS THOUGH THAT THAT PROCESS IS NEEDED- WE CERTAINLY CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS YOU HEARD FROM US AT THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE FOR WELL OVER. YOU KNOW COUPLE YEARS NOW ADVOCATING IN SUPPORT OF MANY THE PEOPLE THAT HELPS FOR HELPING CONSTRUCTION. AND OF COURSE YOU HAD DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW BEST TO DO THAT. BUT AGAIN WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. UNFORTUNATELY SB NINE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH THAN IT DOES- YOU KNOW DISREGARD THAT COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL OF OUR CITIES ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING THE UPDATE TO THEIR HOUSE YOU KNOW MEANT RIGHT NOW. THE END OF THE LITTLE OVER A YEAR WE'RE GONNA GET A FIVE MORE THAN TWO MILLION SITES. FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE SITES WILL BE READY AND FOR DEVELOPMENT IS ONLY WILL BE CONSISTENT SHORTLY THEREAFTER. SO DEVELOPERS WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM MORE THAN TWO MILLION LOCATIONS FOR SITE FOR HOUSING TO BE CONSTRUCTED MORE THAN THOSE UNITS BE AVAILABLE. SB NINE UNFORTUNATELY DISREGARDS THAT PROCESS INSTEAD CITIES EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE GOT YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT CERTIFIED EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE CALLING THE PLANT THEM ALL OF THE STATE. YOU WILL NEED TO ALLOW FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVAL AND THE CREATION OF ADDITIONAL DENSITY IN YOUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. NO MATTER WHAT THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN WITH YOUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THAT MANAGER- WE RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR NO VOTE ON THIS BY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING TODAY ALSO- WE WILL NOW GO TO- ONLINE TO WITNESS IN SOME.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS WORKING YES SIR OKAY THANK YOU- FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL- AND FOR YOUR YOU KNOW CONTINUED WORK ON INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS TODAY FOR YOU I'M THE FIRST ONE IS- ONE THAT I BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR WHEN YOU PRESENTED S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY I BELIEVE. IN THIS COMMITTEE- AND IT HAS TO DO- IT'S REGARDING AN INCREASE IN DENSITY IN AREAS PRONE TO WILDFIRES YOU KNOW- MY DISTRICT IS MAJORITY OF URBAN AREAS- HOWEVER PARTS OF THE DISTRICT- ARE ALONG THE FOOTHILLS ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITIES OF SUNLAND TUJUNGA- AND THIS AREA IN MY DISTRICT IS DESIGNATED AS A FIRE HAZARD ZONE- LAST YEAR I BELIEVE YOUR BILL PROVIDED EXEMPTIONS FROM THOSE FIRES OWNS- HOWEVER THIS ANALYSIS STATES THAT IT'S UNCLEAR. WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL OR THIS VERSION INTENDS TO LIMIT STREAMLINING IN THESE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- SEE IF YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THROUGH THE CHAIR AS SOON RIVAS IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN PARTNERSHIP ON SO MANY ISSUES VERY GRATEFUL. I NUMBER ONE AT THE FIRE RESTRICTION LANGUAGE THAT'S IN- SB NINE IS THE SAME AS IN SB ELEVEN TWENTY LAST YEAR- AND I ABSOLUTELY HERE AT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN- WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONCERN OF VIOLENT FAR AND I NEVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR BUT- THE CHAIR AND I REPRESENT. AN AREA OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER OUT ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE IN THE NATION. HI MODIFIERS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING- NOW OUT FOR CINEMA LAKE COUNTIES MENDOCINO COUNTY AS WELL. ONE OF THE POSITIVE PARTS OF THIS BILL. IS THERE IS A BIG FOCUS ON LOCAL CONTROL. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE A TO BE IN DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE ZONES. AT THIS BILL IN ITS FORM NOW DOES NOT BAN DEVELOPMENT OUT RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE IN HIGH FIRE ZONES. THAT SAID ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW COULD DO THAT FOR ANY TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL- NOW. THIS INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL OF A PROHIBITING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS SO CITY OR COUNTY COULD DO THAT. HI EVEN AS WE SPEAK THERE'S A COUPLE ISSUES I'D LIKE TO BE A TOUCH ON ON- BOTH STATUTORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION ON THE POTENTIAL LIMITATION OF DEVELOPMENT HIGH FIRE ZONES. NUMBER ONE- THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IS CURRENTLY UPDATING THEIR STANDARDS ABOUT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL PROHIBITIONS. FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS TO THOSE HEARINGS ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. NUMBER TWO. BUT A COMPLEMENTARY BILL TO SB NINE IS SENATE BILL TWELVE SENATE BILL TWELVE WOULD PROHIBIT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPROVING NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES UNLESS THE DEVELOPMENT CAN MEET NEW STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR- IT'S BACK WITH SOME AMENDMENTS THIS YEAR- AND IT WOULD BE FOCUSING ON NEW WILDFIRE HAZARDS- ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS MITIGATION PLANES THAT I DEVELOPMENTS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING FORWARD SANDERS FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION. OPERATIONS MANDATORY- ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM TO ENSURE MAINTENANCE OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE AS LONG AS THE DEVELOPMENT IS THERE IN THAT HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES- BUT AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR DOES NOT EXPLICITLY BAN AT DEVELOPMENT BUT ANY CITY OR CAN YOU CAN DO THAT EVEN IF TO SPEAK THE LAST PIECE OF SPACES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- IS VERY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES IN FACT- HE'S PURSUING THREE DIFFERENT LITIGATION- CASES ON THREE DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THREE COUNTIES RIGHT NOW. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THE COUNTY OF LAKE AND I CAN COUNTY SAN DIEGO ALL FOCUSED ON THE LACK OF. FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS UNDER SEQUEL. SO THAT THERE IS AN INTENSE FOCUS RIGHTFULLY SO AND THAT IS A PASSION OF MINE AS WE SEEN HI THOUSANDS OF HOMES BURNED OVER THE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS. RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SENATE BILL TWELVE THE BOARD OF FORESTRY- IS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACTION IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DEVELOP LONG TERM. IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. SO SB TWELVE IS MOVING ALONG THIS YEAR IN THE PROCESS. YES MA'AM IT'S- CURRENTLY HERE- IN THE ASSEMBLY IN PASSIVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OUT OF THE SENATE. OKAY I HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION IS ARE YOU- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT. WE ALL KNOW THAT WERE IN HOUSING CRISIS WHICH IS FEEDING INTO OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS- YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON. HOUSING PRODUCTION AND INCREASING THE SUPPLY IN OUR STATE- HOWEVER WE ALL KNOW THAT. PURCHASING HOMES TO TURN THEM AROUND AND YOU KNOW TO TURN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND TWO QUAD PLEXUS IS- AND- IT THEY CAN DISPLACE- CURRENT RESIDENTS- THAT RESIDE IN THESE HOMES- THEREFORE GENTRIFYING. CURRENT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- AND THEN LIKE I SAID DISPLACING THE CURRENT RESIDENTS ARE. AND YOU KNOW. I GUESS THEY'RE FORCED TO RELOCATE TO AREAS OF WHAT BETTER FOR EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR WORK- A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THEY MOVE OUT THEY GO TO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY- WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THEN THEY TRAVEL INTO LOS ANGELES TO WORK BECAUSE THE JOBS ARE STILL IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES R. AND SO. I GUESS I WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU OR THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL WOULD CONSIDER- YOU KNOW WOULD YOU CONSIDER LOW INCOME AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVISIONS. IN THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN KEEP HOUSING COSTS AFFORDABLE. FOR ALL FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE DISPLACED. IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- IN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED IN ON. IT IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME DO A DEP DIVE IT'S ALRIGHT MADAM CHAIR ABSOLUTELY IN ADDISON NUMBER RIVAS ON THAT ISSUE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE AND TALK ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY AND THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT- GENTRIFICATION AS WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THEIR AFFORDABLE DISCUSSION WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT AFFORDABILITY- THERE IS A STUDY DONE ON EIGHTY USE IN THE EAST BAY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. IN THE TYPICAL EIGHTY YOU IN THIS STUDY. IS RENTING AT ABOUT 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. NOW UNDER OUR TENANT PROTECTION BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR ALONG WITH THE OVER TWO BILLION WE COVER AT TENANTS LIVING IN RENTALS UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT. OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME. SO THE AVERAGE EIGHTY YOU IN THE EAST BAY IS RENTING AT ABOUT 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP IS THESE EIGHTY USE WHICH WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR SIZE TO THESE DUPLEXES ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT WE WOULD SEE A TYPICAL MARKET RATE. APARTMENT LET ALONE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME- NUMBER TWO THERE'S A REASON WHY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY SUPPORTS THIS BILL. THERE'S A REASON WHY BRIDGE HOUSING ONE OF THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN THE STATE SUPPORTS THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THAT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY WHO IS AN EXPERT ON WORKING ON SMALLER LOTS AND GETTING THE MOST FOR FAMILIES I WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS BILL TO PROVIDE PROVIDE A FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS. OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE. SO I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL ON THE TENANT PROTECTION ISSUES I LIKE TO BE A CLEAR UP SOME ISSUES ON TENURE PROTECTION. SO ON TENER PROTECTIONS TEN PROTECTIONS APPLY IN SB NINE. SO IT SB NINE WOULD PROTECT TENANTS. LIVING IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT- THE RESTRICTIONS IN REGARD TO TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL- SB NINE NUMBER ONE RESPECTS LOCAL TENANT PROTECTION LAW. SO IF A CITY OR COUNTY HAS AN EVICTION LAW OR A MORATORIUM IN PLACE THAT IS STRICTER THAN WHAT THE CURRENT. STATUTE IS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT LOCAL LAW IS GRANDFATHERED IN. THIS BILL DOES NOT DISRUPT ANY ACTION THAT IS CITY COUNCIL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. NOW IN THIS BILL THE LANGUAGE STATES IF A TENANT HAS RESIDED IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS YOU CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH DEMOLITION. OR TRANSITION OF THAT SINGLE FAMILY HOME TO A DUPLEX SO- THAT PROPERTY IS SIMPLY NOT ELIGIBLE. SO IF A TENANT HAS LIVED IN THE HOME. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS YOU CAN'T TRANSITION AT HOME. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY STRICT STANDARDS THAT'S EMBEDDED WITHIN SB NINE AND REALLY STARTS- A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IN THE STATE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO STAND STRONG FOR TENANTS IN THE MILLIONS WHO ARE CALLING THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME DWELLINGS- HOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES. NOW THIS BILL ALSO HAS CHANGED SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS IN FRONT OF YOU. WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT- TO AVOID SPECULATION. AVOID LARGE- PROFITEERING GROUPS COMING IN TO BETTER DEVELOP THESE LOTS THAT OWNERS SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE THERE. AND SO NOW IN SB NINE- IF A CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WANTS TO PUT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS ON TO A FOUR PLEX OR DUPLEX. THEY CAN DO THAT. UNDER ELEVEN TWENTY LAST YEAR THEY COULD NOT. IN THAT'S RESPONDING TO CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IN NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS SO THAT IF I OWN AND I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. AT THEIR CORE ADD VERY SMALL HOME OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUARE FEET LARGER LOTS OF QUARTER ACRE MOST OF THE HOMES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU OR A G. EIGHTY YOU AND INDEED YOU ALREADY ON IT- AND I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- TALK ABOUT HOW. HOMEOWNERS COULD DOUBLE DIP. IF YOU HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU A GT ON A SINGLE FAMILY HOME YOU CAN'T IT'S A MAXIMUM OF FOUR UNITS ON A LOT. THAT'S IT- NO I THINK I'D LIKE TO SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER INTO THE CHAIR IF IT'S ALL RIGHT. IS THE ISSUE ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. TO BE ABLE TO AVOID GENTRIFICATION. BUT THIS BILL IS ALSO ABOUT INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN ASSUME. THAT IT'S ALL GOING TO BE PROFITEERS IT'S GONNA BE COMING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WILL BE SELLING OFF AND IN HOMEOWNER SELLING OFF THEIR HOMES I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOMES THAT HAVE A GED YOU AN EIGHTY OR BOTH HAVE THE HOMEOWNER LIVING IN THE FRONT HOUSE. I AND WE SEE THAT HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS WELL. AND THAT BUILDS LONG TERM INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH FOR THOSE FAMILIES. AS YOU'RE ABLE TO BUILD THAT LAND VALUE UP WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL UNITS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL MARKET RATE WOULD BE. SO SOME MEMBER I'D BE HAPPY TO GO FURTHER- IF THEY'RE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS AND BUT I THINK I SOME THE RESISTANCE OF SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS AND- THAT'S WHY WE'VE REALLY TAKEN THIS ISSUE OF TENANT PROTECTION. IN AFFORDABILITY SO- SO STRONGLY. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE- YOUR EFFORTS I KNOW I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND OTHERS- YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TO VOTE FOR ME TO TAKE YEAH- BECAUSE OF OPPOSITION AND MY DISTRICT IN MY REGION- YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE- YOU'RE WILLING. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE ARE. A PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- YOU KNOW LIKE TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. BASED ON- OUR EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS AND COMMITMENTS THAT YOU'VE MADE- YOU KNOW IT JUST TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION YOU KNOW I. I DO BELIEVE WE NEED- HOUSING MORE HOUSING AND ARE STATE TEN. I'M ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS- BUT- YOU KNOW I DO WANT US TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU CONTINUE TO SPEAK TO STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN. BOB AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT. WERE ABLE TO COME. TOGETHER WITH SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT THAT. ASSURES US THAT THIS WILL BE AND THE SPELL THAT- IT THIS IS NOT JUST- SOMETHING THAT. WILL BENEFIT DEVELOPERS ONLY. SEVEN I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO I WILL BE HONEST- IN TWO NATIONS- IN THE ARGUMENT AND WE'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR WHICH IS WHY. WE'VE MADE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL FROM LAST YEAR- BASED OFF OF FEEDBACK YOU OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL AS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD. YOU OF MY COMMITMENT- I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHAIRWOMAN WE NEED ALL THE TIME WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. THAT AT WILL CONTINUE THAT AND IF THERE ARE ANY GROUPS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET WITH IN YOUR DISTRICT WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO AS WELL IN IS WHEN I SAY THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK AND AT FOR YOUR CONSTANT DAILY TO BE ABLE TO MEET AND- TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN CRITICAL TO THE SHAPE OF. THIS BILL AND I KNOW. THAT WE MORE WORK TO GO. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME MA'AM. YES WE- A QUESTION FROM A SETTLEMENT. MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR A SIMILAR- THAT TURNED ON- SO I'M LOOKING AT AN OPPOSITION LETTER RIGHT NOW FROM ONE OF MY CITIES AND I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR DRESSING THE ISSUE OF HIGH FIRE ZONES A VISTA BORDERS ON THE HIGH FIRE. ANA AREA AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCREASING DENSITY THAT COULD BE HAPPENING WITH THIS- ONE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK IS A CITY OPTED IN FOR THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I'VE HEARD FROM CONSTITUENTS IS THAT- THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY TRANSFORMING USE SB NINE WOULD BE THOSE WHO ALREADY ARE VERY AFFLUENT SO THE MIDDLE INCOME AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS. IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT TO THE TO THAT ARE IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION I THINK- I'LL TALK ABOUT EIGHTY USING DUPLEXES IN GENERAL IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU I THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON FINANCING OF EIGHTIES JD USE. THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT- VERY FOCUSED ON- AND I THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ADVANCE A FINANCING MECHANISM TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOMEOWNERS LOWER INCOME HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS THIS- RIGHT. NOW IN MANY OF THESE CITIES THEY WOULD ALLOW A SINGLE FAMILY HOME TO BE ABLE TO BE DEVELOPED. I BEHIND AT HOME THERE HAS NOT BEEN NEARLY AS MUCH- VOICE TO THAT ISSUE VERSUS BEING ABLE TO PUT A DUPLEX BEHIND HOME. IN WHAT WE KNOW IS BASED OFF OF THE STUDY THAT WE SAW IN THE EAST BAY- IS THAT THESE EIGHTY USE AND I'LL SAY DUPLEXES ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE. MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A RENTING OF A SECOND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE ON A LOT. I BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE RIGHT- IN THE LACK OF THE YARD SO I DO THINK BY DESIGN THEY ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE. AND THAT THE ONE OTHER PIECE OF SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE TIME YOU KNOW I STOP IN THIRTY SECONDS I HAVE THREE MORE QUESTIONS OKAY- IS THAT- IT'S ALL EYES WILL BE CLEAR TO IS THAT- FLOOR AREA RATIO. AT SET BACK AS WELL AS HIGH ARE NOT AT THIS BILL DOES NOT OVERRIDE ANY OF THOSE THREE ISSUES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ALSO CONTINUE TO APPLY SET BACKS FLORI RATIO AND HIGH. I TO THESE UNITS. I'M SORRY THAT ONE OF SOME NO THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THAT LEADS INTO MY NEXT QUESTION SO WHEN WE DID THE INCREASE IN DENSITY AND ANTHONY THIS WE PUT A MAXIMUM AVERAGE SIZE. ON THE UNITS AS THEIR MAXIMUM AVERAGE SIZE THOUGH WHAT HAPPENS IN MY AREAS THEY WOULD BUILD LARGER TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MCMANSIONS WHICH WE KNOW BY THAT SIZE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE AND ANYWAY IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TAKE A TWO MILLION DOLLAR HOME. DIVIDED FOR EACH COST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU TAKE A TWO MILLION DOLLAR HOMES BUT IN THE FOR EACH ONE COSTS ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RIGHT SO IS THERE A MAXIM AVERAGE SIZE THAT THAT SIZE ITSELF IN. LEAD TO MORE NATURAL AFFORDABILITY. THERE IS NO MAXIMUM SIZE BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS THAT YOU COULD DEVELOP ON A TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BUILDING- THE MINIMUM IS DEVELOPING A TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BUILDING PARCEL- SO THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOU TO IT SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET- BUT- THERE THERE IS NOT A MAXIMUM I SIZE ON THIS AT THIS TIME MMHM. AND THEN MY NEXT QUESTION GOES TO RENO- AND MOST OF MY CITIES OUR ISSUE IS NOT MODERATE OR ABOVE MODERATE HOUSING IT IS ACTUALLY THE LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING AND IF YOU TAKE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND YOU DIVIDE IT WHAT'S THE RENO CREDIT THAT CITIES WOULD GET THROUGH SB NINE. FOR ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING. YEAH I MEAN I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT THESE WOULD BE CONSIDERED. MARKET RATE RENTALS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH WE KNOW THAT BASED OFF THE STUDY IN THE EAST BAY THAT THE EASY TO USE SO EIGHTY USER PROBABLY ANYWHERE BETWEEN- FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET THEY'RE RENTING IT SIXTY TWO PERCENT. OF THE MEDIAN SO THAT THEY ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE BUT I THINK THE OTHER PIECES- JUST WANT TO MENTION IS THAT SB NINE IS PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. BUT THERE IS NOT GONNA BE A SILVER BULLET TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AND THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S LOOKING AT AN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN HOMELESS HOUSING THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING THE SENATE WILL BE ADVANCING IN THIS PACKAGE LED BY TONI ATKINS. ON THE SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND WHICH WE SO DESPERATELY NEED THERE'S GONNA BE NEARLY TWO BILLION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FOR ADDITIONAL FOR DOUBLE HOUSING AND THAT EIGHTY YOU FINANCING THAT I MENTIONED. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF YOUR BUDGET SUB AND IN FACT CENTER CABALLERO IS HERE AND IS WELL THERE IS RIGHT NOW- THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A DO YOU FINANCING IN THE BUDGET APPROVED OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA NEED THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT ON THAT. WHICH WOULD USHER IN ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE UNITS- BUT- NOW CITIES COULD DO SOME TYPE OF DEED RESTRICTION RIGHT THAT. WOULD THEN MAKE IT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO CITIES COULD BE. THE EXTRA HOMES DEVELOPED UNDER SB NINE TO BE. DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE AND THEY POTENTIALLY COULD. YES MMHM- AND THE LAST QUESTION AND YOU YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT SO. YOU SAID THAT THERE IS A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FOUR UNITS THAT COULD BE CONVEYED SEPARATELY AFTER A YEAR. RIGHT WHAT.WHAT COVERAGES ARE INCLUDED IN SB NINE. THAT WOULD PRECLUDE. THEM FROM ACTUALLY BUILDING A JDO IN EIGHTY BECAUSE AFTER THAT POINT THEY'RE STILL SINGLE FAMILY HOME. SO THEY CAN STILL HAVE THAT START ON THE MECHANISM AS BENIGN THAT THAT HOW YOU LIMIT THAT WHEN ONCE YOU'RE YOU'RE OUT AND THEN THEY'RE BEING CONVEYED SEPARATELY. YES MA'AM- SO. TWO THINGS ONE. THAT THE HOMEOWNER IS GOING TO WHEN THEY PULL THEIR PERMIT WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION WHETHER IT'S A CITY OR COUNTY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WITHIN THEIR PERMIT. ON WHAT THEY'RE GONNA PLACE ON A LOT WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE FAMILY HOME HGTV EIGHTY OR DUPLEX NUMBER TWO THERE'S ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DISCLOSE HOW MANY WATER AND SEWER HOOK UPS. AND ELECTRICAL HOOKUPS THAT THEY HAVE ON THOSE UNITS AND SO I'M NOT AT ALL TRYING TO PASS THE BUCK BUT THIS AGAIN IS PART OF THE LOCAL CONTROL THAT LOCAL CITY OR COUNTY THAT WOULD BE APPROVING THIS DEVELOPMENT. WILL KNOW WHAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT- WOULD BE PUT ON THERE WHETHER IT'S A G. D. U. EIGHTY OR DUPLEX- BASED OFF OF ONE THEIR ACTUAL BURNING BUILDING PERMIT FOR THE UNITS. AND THROUGH THE HOOK UPS THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO APPLY FOR THROUGH THE LOCAL WATER DISTRICT WITH THE CITY OR THE COUNTY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS YES JUST- WAS HOPING- MR CENTER OF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION- MY OFFICE IS RECEIVING NUMBER OF CALLS AND ENQUIRIES ABOUT HOW. SB I COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT FRANCE'S THERE H. AWAY- HOMEOWNERS AS CATFISH AND SO IF- YOU COULD. SPEAK TO THAT AGREEMENT HOAS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL SO WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ALSO WOULD NOT IMPACT ON HISTORIC DISTRICTS ARE LANDMARK DISTRICTS EITHER GREAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- I ENTERTAIN A MOTION. HER MOTION NINE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST SECONDS IT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WITH RESPECT LASSEN I DON'T I JUST WANNA SAY MINIATURE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL QUESTIONS ARE ADVANCED SEDATE THE COMMENTS AND TO ALL THE FEEDBACK AND I PROMISE YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND MOST INTENSELY MEET WITH THOSE WHO OPPOSE AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK DISPELLING RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU IN CENTER I REALLY APPRECIATE DO THINK ALL THE CLARIFICATION THAT- PEOPLE MAY HAVE NOT READ AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES TO THE BILL- I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON A BILL AND TO SENATOR ATKINS- AND I KNOW YOU WORKED REALLY HARD TO- AMOUNT OF TIME TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PRESERVING LOCAL CONTROL YEAH WELL ALLOWING MORE HOME CONSTRUCTION. AND THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION TO THIS AND SO- WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE A HOUSING CRISIS HAS BEEN GOING ON AND ON AND IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND IT WAS A BENEFICIAL THE YOU MENTIONED OTHER BILLS THAT MAY BE COMING OUR WAY OR NOT- THAT ARE ALL LINKED TOGETHER FOR I HAVE GOOD MAKE GOOD POTENTIAL HOUSING POLICY SO. I THINK THAT THE BILL DOES WHAT WE WANTED TO AT THIS POINT I THINK THERE IS SOME MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON IT AND SO WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY LACKEY. LACKEY NOW BLOOM. BERMAN THAT VOTE. BOERNER HORVATH NOT. BOERNER HORVATH VOTE ROB. FIFTY FIVE MODEL ALL RIGHT THREE OF US LIST WE I ROBERT. ROBERT RIVAS HAVE A PELL. HI THAT'S FIVE ONE OKAY THE BILL IS OUT AND THEN WE HAVE ALL OUR MEMBERS HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MAY CONTAIN FOR PRESENTING THAT TODAY WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB. THREE TWO THREE SENATOR CABALLERO. THANK YOU FOR GIVING HER A LESSON EARLY AND WE DO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION OF DO PASS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE TWO THREE WHICH WOULD CREATE A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE SETTINGS. WATER AND SEWER THE SEWER UTILITY BUDGETS ARE FUNDED BY REVENUE COLLECTED THROUGH SERVICE RATES THESE RATES PROVIDE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPLY SAFE DRINKING WATER UPGRADE AND IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LAWSUITS THAT SEEK REFUNDS OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE EXISTING RATE STRUCTURES YEARS AFTER RATES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND COLLECTED. THESE DELAYED LOTS WHOSE CAN THREATEN IN A BIT AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT GUARANTEED BY REV REVENUE FROM RATES DERAIL ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND GENERALLY UNDERMINE AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABLE BUDGETS. NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. LATELY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES FILED AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES RATE STRUCTURES. FOR SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUED THE CHALLENGED RATES WERE ADOPTED YEARS AFTER THE LAWSUIT. AND NOW WITH THE ADDITIONAL STRAIN OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITS PROHIBITING WATER SHUT OFFS REGARDLESS OF A CUSTOMER'S ABILITY TO PAY WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE UNDER CONSTANT FINANCIAL STRAIN AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE AT RISK. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTRICAL RATES OR CHARGES SB TWO THIRTY TWO ADDS CONSISTENCY TO EXISTING LAW. FOR ALL THREE THE AUTHORIZING A LOCAL AGENCY OR INTERESTED PERSON TO BRING A VALIDATION ACTION IN SUPERIOR COURT DETERMINED THE BILL THE LADY OF A FEED. BOB FREE OR CHARGE FOR SEWER AND SEWER WATER AND SEWER SERVICES IF A VALIDATION ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THOSE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS PARTIES WOULD BE BARRED FROM CHALLENGING. THE VALIDITY OF A FEE OR CHARGE. BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO BRING CHALLENGES WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BALANCE INTO INTEREST OF REPAIRS WITH THOSE OF THE PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCY IN AND THE CURRENT PRACTICE. THANKS THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TO TESTIFIED SUPPORT IS CHRIS ANDERSON FROM AWKWARD DISSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND PAUL COOK THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT MOVES ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR MOTION SECOND- YOU RE HAVE- MIST- CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON ON THE PHONE PLEASE OR PAUL COOK PLEASE. OPERATOR AND WHILE WE DO THAT I DO NOT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE FROM IN THE AUDIENCE FOR THE BILL. FOR IN SUPPORT OF IT. OKAY WHY DON'T WE HAVE YOU TESTIFIED. WORK LIKE JUST THE- I- SKEWS ME YOU KNOW WHAT LET ME HEAR THE TWO ABOVE AYE AYE FUNK AYE THOSE. SECURING GOT LOST HERE THANK YOU WILL HAVE A MR ANDERSON AND MR COOK TO SPEAK FIRST. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON THE HALFPENNIES DESTINATION THE CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OF PROUD SPONSOR OF SB THREE TWO THREE- PURCHASED ONE I THINK THAT MANY STAFF FOR THEIR KNOWLEDGE THIS. TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR CABALLERO AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. SB THREE TWO THREE PASSED THE SENATE LAST NIGHT WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT CAME IN PART BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES NOT PRESENT A NEW OR REVOLUTIONARY IDEA THIS BILL ALIGNS LONG. PRECEDENT EXISTING LOFT HUNDRED TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ARE IF HE'S ALREADY PROVIDER PUT MEANS FALL LECTURE CREATES CONNECTION. AT THE CHARGES I WATERED STILL RAGING THESE. AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT EATEN CHARGES. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR IMPORTANT POLICY READS AND WANTED TO RECCHI CAN'T RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO REDUCE FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. SB THREE TWO THREE SPEAK TO PROVIDE SIMILAR PROTECTIONS TO WATER AND SEWER SERVICE AND SIMPLY CLOSE THIS GAP IN EXISTING LAW- PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE LARGELY FUNDED BY RATE REVENUE THESE RATES PROVIDE FUNDING NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT WEAPONS SYSTEMS MAKING RELIABLE OPERATION. OR THE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE STRUCTURES NAPA FINANCIALLY DESTABILIZING EFFECT FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES. AS A CLEANING OUT THIS POINTS OUT PROP TO EIGHTEENTH AND FERTILE GROUND FOR LITIGATION THE REQUESTED- CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST EIGHTY ONE WATER SUPPLIERS CALIFORNIA IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THE BOUNDS OF PROP TWO EIGHTEEN- DETESTED. IN THAT CASE MANY OF THE DEPEND AGENCIES ADOPTED THEIR RATE YEARS BEFORE THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED. AND LONG AFTER REVENUE WAS COLLECTED AND EXPAND IT SB THREE Q. THREE DRESSES THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING REPAIRS TO BRING LAWSUITS WITHIN A LIMITED FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME IMPORTANTLY.

ILLEGALLY YOU TAKE ALL THAT WATER FOR ALL YOUR PROJECT. IF YOU CUSTOM ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE. THE CARD AGAIN TO. THREE SO. WE'RE GOING TO SAYTHAT THE FINE SHOULD BE AT LEAST WHAT IT COSTS THE PERMIT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK IF YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH T GET THE PERMIT. MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT LOWERING PERMITTING FEES LATER. BUT IT IS THE WATER DISTRICT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THAT CLEAN POTABLE WATER IN PEOPLE HOOKING UP ILLEGALLY TO BE ABLE TO RUN A BUSINESS. IS NOT A GOOD USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE DROUGHT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING MORE OF THIS WATER THEFT. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY ALLOWS. LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WATER DISTRICTS TO INCREASE THE FINES. IF IT'S TOO MUCH FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS STOLEN WATER- DATE THAT THAT THEY THERE IS A HARDSHIP PEOPLE CAN APPLY FOR. WE THINK THAT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE OF PRESERVING OUR WATER OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PENALTIES MATCH THE AT THAT THE CRIME.
