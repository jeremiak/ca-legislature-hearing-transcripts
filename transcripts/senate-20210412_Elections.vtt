districts are able to smoothly

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.373
make a transition from at large

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.641
elections to district based

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.776
elections without incurring the

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.845
cost and delays of California

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.480
voting rights act lawsuits

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.515
during that process since

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:23.816
the passage of the California

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.951
voting rights act in two

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.352

representation and equity

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.622
elections more than two hundred

of California's one thousand

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.391
thirty seven school districts

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.659
have since switched from at

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.428
large elections to district

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.163
based systems for the election

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.265
of trustees in recent years

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.299
it has been the consistent

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.667
policy of both is the of

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.102
this legislation to encourage

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.670
political subdivisions to

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.139
adopt district based elections

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.774
while giving to simplify the

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.742
process for doing so toward

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.244
that end California education

elections in a prompt and

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.054
inclusive process unfortunately

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.456
as a result of an Akron isn't

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.224
and state law school districts

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.159

county are not entitled to the

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:12.331
same process and are instead

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.866
required to put any ordinance

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.034
on establishing trust your

electors of the district which

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.338
is a burdensome requirements

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.640
often results in the need to

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:23.209
hold in to pay for an official

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.044
election in practice school

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.179
districts and bypass the

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.780
stature requirement by securing

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.282
a waiver from the state board

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.284
of education this extra step

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.518
however still adds time an

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:33.920
additional cost to the adoption

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.555
of trustee -- elections with

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:36.989
the unfortunate and ironic

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.024
result that socialists have

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.258
actually resulted in the

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.526
holding of such an at large

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.694
elections which are found to be

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.663
in violation of the California

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.198
voting rights act simply

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.432
put these unnecessary and

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.633
unproductive complexities can

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.535
result in costly litigation and

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.070
subsequent unlawful at large

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.205
elections that perpetuate the

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.973
dilution of minority voters in

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.741
violation of either the spirit

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.743
or the letter of the CVR ag

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.445
SB four four two fixes this

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.913
problem by allowing ordinances

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.014
approving a proposed and to

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.716

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.652
adoption without the need

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:07.553
for an additional election

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.322
to affirm approval under

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:10.356

update their voter registration

which include one they arrived

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.327
to believe they're already

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:36.595
registered to vote or that

their voter registration is

already up to date second they

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:40.833
may be in a rush to leave the

DMV and fully intend to do so

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.370
later -- but failed to do so at

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.638
a later time third that they're

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.207
confused or unsure of their

this is a particular problem

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:53.946
for formerly incarcerated

for pre reg registration as

a result of recent changes

called hard stop system leads

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.958

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:13.599
that roughly four million

being fully qualified to do so

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.038
in a do Chen and perhaps more

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:21.240
problematically the current

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.142

when it comes to voting SB

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:31.917
five eight three would plug

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:32.751
these current leaks in the

these new registrants a multi

chance to decline registration

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.348
as well as the option of

receiving a ballot by mail the

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.361
which is currently employing

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:17.629
a back and if your system

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:18.497
similar to the one being

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:20.365
proposed here in contrast to

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.733
the roughly forty five percent

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.968
of Californians who declined

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.303

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.071
implementation of motor voter

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.140
only one percent of Coloradans

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:29.741
to receive mail notices decline

registration at the same time

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:32.878
since its implementation of

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.746
back and if you are Colorado

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.415
DMV transaction times have

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.116
been reduced as well by up

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.418
to seventy five seconds per

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:41.286
customer in the last review

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.187
it's worth noting that the

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.222
California department of motor

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.456
vehicles is already collecting

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.491
and recording information

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:46.458
with respect to the type of

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.193
identity documents a person

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.262
provides an automated back in

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.563
system like those state like

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.998
states like Colorado uses

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.132
would simply leverages on

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.934
going work flow to ascertain

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.402
eligibility enrollment for

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.904
voting in a more streamlined

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.139
and secure way as noted

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.407
implementing back in eighty

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.442
are would also streamlined

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.077
registration updates if an

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.178
existing registered voter

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.312
provides an address your name

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.914
to the DMV that differs from

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.883
registration records the DMV

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.050
would then automatically for

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:13.118
that change of information

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.052
to elected officials for

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.854
updating in their records the

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:16.722
voter would then receive a

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.023
notice by mail of the change

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.091
to include the opportunity to

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.259
make any additional updates

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.361
or corrections because someone

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.295
registered voters may not

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:24.730
provide proof of citizenship

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.732
during certain DMV transactions

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.166
the provisions of SB five

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:29.167
eight three would maintain the

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.003
current motor voter system for

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.504
unregistered people who do not

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.072
provide proof of US citizenship

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:36.608
ship during DMV transactions

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:37.743
and to ensure appropriate

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:39.511
protections for non citizens

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:40.979
the back in AB are system would

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.748
automatically filter out DMV

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.216
customers who have provided

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:45.484
documents establishing foreign

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.252
citizenship such as a green

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.921
card applicants for an AB sixty

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:51.123
license these DMV customers

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.257
would not be offered the chance

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.892
to register and would not have

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.227
any of their information passed

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.528
on by the system to election

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.530
officials by contrast the

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:00.499
current system offers all DMV

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.134
customers the opportunity to

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.435
register to vote even if they

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.337
have provided proof of provided

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:06.805
proof of non citizenship as

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.307
part of their transaction

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:09.374
this quirk of the current

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:11.009
system exposes non citizens

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.778
to a needless trap if they

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.079
make a mistake when faced with

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.380
citizenship and registration

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.015
questions as a result in

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.750
attention confusion or of

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:20.852
limited English proficiency

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.220
they can inadvertently expose

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.221
themselves to potentially

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.723
catastrophic criminal and

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.525
immigration consequences

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:27.893
finally recognizing that the

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.494
DMV does not reach all eligible

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.429
voters the bill would give

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:32.164
the sector State the authority

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.932
to extend back in AB are to

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.901
other state agencies that

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.369
procedurally verify U. S.

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:38.670
citizenship as part of standard

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.639
agency transactions as is the

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.441
case with medi cal enrollment

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:45.143
program run by DH CS the

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.612
implementation back in AB are

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:47.980
proposed by SB five eight three

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:49.114
offers a range of benefits

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.549
and improvements compared to

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.851
the current system to include

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.086
an easier more streamlined

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:56.054
workflow for the DMV safely

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:56.989
and accurately expanding

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:58.023
the number of registered

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.758
California voters ensuring

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.059
a more diverse electorate

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.160
is appropriate reflective

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.428
of California's diverse and

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.464
dynamic population continually

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.032
updating records enabling more

accurate voter registration

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.534
databases thereby reducing

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.736
work by County registrar

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.270

raise some questions about SB

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.370
five eighty three I want to

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:41.239
clarify that our organization

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:42.974
neither supports nor opposes

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.809
this legislation the where

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:46.778
are not unofficial opposer

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:48.179
we just would like to urge

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:49.347
the committee to carefully

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:50.982
examine certain questions we

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.517
have about the legislation

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:53.851
we also acknowledge and

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.153
appreciate the leadership of

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.588
senator Newman and all of the

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:57.822
proponent of that the H.

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.591
ID eighty three in working

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:00.992
to make voter registration

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:03.061
accessible to all Californians

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:04.662
because we share that important

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:06.831
call so the first question

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.633
we have is whether the

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.135
significant changes that SB

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.704
five eighty three you would

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.138
make the current new motor

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.407
voter program in terms of

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.776
making determinations about

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:20.278
whether certain documents show

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.580
citizenship are non citizenship

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:25.483
will indeed be more protective

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.652
than the current multi step

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.320
Act has station process that

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.222
is use our folks have talked

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.790
about human error but when you

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.792
have to design a new systems

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:37.061
automated new system train

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:40.765
people -- come up with a new

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:43.134
way of doing things there are

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:46.170
certainly also -- opportunities

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:48.339
and -- possibilities of human

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.508
error there so we question

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.810
what kind of testing what kind

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:55.613
of training -- what kind of

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.415
are really serious quality

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.117
assurance is going to be done

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:00.885
in creating that the automated

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:03.354
system that is going to -- you

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.657
know use documents to determine

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.625
Abu would automatically be

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:10.028
put on the voter rolls I will

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:12.163
also note that at this time

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.831
you know California is facing

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:16.267
some serious investments that

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.568
I have to make the deal with

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:20.238
cold at nineteen -- in terms

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.607
of our housing education health

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.609
payer economic development

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:26.511
and employment opportunities

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.546
and we question whether we are

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.114
going to get an appreciable

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.583
increase in voter registration

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.118
from the investment that is

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:37.055
going to be needed -- for --

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.390
the new system -- you know we

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.525
know some other states have

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:41.626
been sighted but these are

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.294
state that have very different

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:45.496
populations in California in

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:48.266
terms of their diversity --

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.902
and -- we also wonder whether

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:53.171
if indeed the issue of people

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:55.506
declining to register in front

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:58.309
and might be addressed by some

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.244
kind of education or better

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.280
clarification in the current

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.082
system rather than putting all

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.584
of these resources in a new

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.119
automated or some other kind

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:10.488
of system based on documents --

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.622
there are some other features

00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:13.257
of the proposed SB five eighty

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.125
three system that we have

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.593
questions about we put this

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.695
into a letter -- for example

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:19.330
it doesn't appear to capture

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:21.165
up front the political party

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:23.201
or vote by mail preference of

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:27.205
the voters -- -- these people

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:28.706
indicate those preferences

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:30.942
would have to stand in and

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.310
respond tool for that they

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:34.612
get in the mail and -- we have

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:35.980
seen at least in Oregon there's

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.849
not always people who answer

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.184
the question or send that form

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:42.653
back -- and we have similar

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.956
questions about the way that

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.491
our language preference for

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:48.559
voting material is collected

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.461
in school you can ultimately

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:52.363
-- again we want to emphasize

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.631
that we very much respect and

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.799
appreciate the commitment of

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.768

everyone for their patience

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.617
and support and in opposition

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:29.452
to this bill -- who of --

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:30.653
provided their testimony on

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.822
our teleconference lines --

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:33.990
we are going to now bring the

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.825
matter back to the committee

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.494
for further discussion and

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.463
quite -- and I will leave

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.499
it off given the absence of

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:43.466
some of my colleagues at the

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:45.468
moment senator Newman thank

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:46.803
you for of bringing this bill

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.338
forward at the goals that you

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.806
outline our goals that I'm a

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.775
hundred percent embrace week

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:52.876
you know we had an incredible

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:56.045
turn out of -- -- voters in

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:57.413
this last election and I think

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.349
it's something of of great

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.084
accomplishment in praise for

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.318
all the folks that are involved

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:03.553
in that the secretary of state

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.722
in the registrar's often down

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.657
the state of the we know and

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:08.925
you have been quite clear that

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.560
there are many others that

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:11.761
might want to participate and

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:12.495
we should do everything we

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:15.431
can to make that as easy and

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.033
as possible I think that's

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.101
the goal that you've outlined

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:19.969
in your bill -- and I fully

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.504
support it the only thing that

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:23.439
gives me some hesitancy -- in

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:25.542
this matter is that -- that

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:26.676
that the department of motor

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:28.011
vehicles is not have a great

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.780
track record -- unfortunately

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.048
-- through administration

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:34.517
staff past and present -- in

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:36.853
being able to take what are

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.855
a thoughtful measures such

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.056
as yours and making sure that

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.158
they're implemented -- fairly

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:45.228
-- and -- and completely

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:48.164
and yet we we have seen that

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.166
track record -- we also know

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.869
that what you're asking for

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.839
nay actually reduced -- --

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:58.541
personnel time -- and and

00:57:58.608 --> 00:57:59.909
create some efficiencies but

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.078
it it comes as a requirement

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.813
that the technology the

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.748
technology has to be there

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.884
-- and that much of what you

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:09.219
-- is going to be required in

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:11.087
your bill is going to be some

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.856
improvements in that technology

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:15.458
and once again unfortunately

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:16.860
-- in state government we've

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.661
struggled in that space -- as

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:21.497
well -- and so that that's the

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:22.432
that's the thing that worries

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.267
me I I was hopeful that we

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.335
would have a representative

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:26.302
from the department of motor

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:27.871
vehicles here to provide their

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.039
thoughts and their testimony

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.841
and we have not had that we

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.276
reached out to them as well --

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.378
Committee is reach out to them

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:36.579
-- and we haven't gotten any

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:38.681
feedback on the operational

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:40.717
side I was also hoping that

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:41.784
we would have someone from the

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:42.952
secretary of state's office

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.053
here to participate in this

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.222
conversation -- today because

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:49.092
they are so important in making

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.261
sure that we dot all the I's

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:52.462
and cross all the keys to make

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.063
sure that the good -- goals

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.098
that you have outlined in your

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:57.066
bill -- can be operational

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.335
as well and unfortunately

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:00.703
they have not come forward to

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:01.971
provide their testimony we've

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.173
reached out to the office and

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.475
-- one of knowledge of course

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:06.576
the great leadership the new

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.444
leadership in that office --

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.013
by secretary of state Weber

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.748
and I certainly there's a lot

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:13.883
of start up -- obligations

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.318
that I'm sure they're they're

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.719
wrestling with and this is

00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:17.954
one of many things that that

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:20.323
they have to focus on but we

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.925
haven't benefitted from their

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:24.060
their their input either and

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.261
so that really is the heart of

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:26.896
it for me is not the goals but

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:29.232
the ability to operationalize

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:30.867
-- what you are calling for

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:33.569
in your bill -- the timeline

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:34.904
that you've establishes pretty

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:37.006
aggressive -- and so that's

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.107
that's the part of it troubles

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:40.243
me as I offer year irrigation

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.111
on that that question -- if

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:44.380
you would all right -- thank

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:45.848
you Mister I I do appreciate

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.383
the questions it particularly I

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.052
think it's reasonable actually

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:53.456
obvious -- to have concerns

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.024
about DMV's prior track

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.592
records relates to technology

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.528
implementation I would

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:01.097
point out that the DMV is --

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.966
apparently making progress --

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.501
over the last year or so under

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.303
the governor's leadership --

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.405
taking some newer very urgent

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:10.707
projects to solving some of the

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.308
problems that come up but it

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.710
but it you know the the proof

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:16.813
is always in the doing with

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.082
respect to the implementation

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.650
of the technology we has a

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:21.451
state will actually in this

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.152
case have the benefit of

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:24.087
the prior experience of some

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.022
other states -- and and so I

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.623
think we can call on states

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.325
such as Colorado for some

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:32.128
insight -- and and and learn

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.765
from their experience but --

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.266
you know these things are

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.402
obviously challenging -- and

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.670
then again back to your point

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:41.738
with respect to timeline

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.906
state as I've made clear -- in

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.308
working with all the different

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.276
stakeholders we're open to it

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.579
-- you know deed I my office

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.080
the the sponsor the bill or

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:53.016
are open to appropriately

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.150
amending those time lines to

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:55.952
make sure that we don't get

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.488
ahead of our skis as they say

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.790
but all in I think it's fairly

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:01.991
clear especially based on the

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:04.027
experience of other states that

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:07.030
this is a workable scenario

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:10.733
-- and when fully implemented

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.602
it has the dual benefit of

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:13.836
increasing the efficiency of

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:16.339
the DMV -- but just in poorly

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.374
actually more importantly Sir

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.610
is that very admirable goal

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.879
of engaging a larger share of

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:23.880
the electorate when it comes

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.482
to opting into voting -- in

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.985
that will be to the good thank

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.953
you for for sharing that I

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.321
guess I don't two things one

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:35.091
is is that you know that there

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.926
have been successful tech

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.795
technological improvements

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.063
that state governments and

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:42.765
other places and I'll put it

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.834
on California is so big and

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.903
so vast and the obligations

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:49.872
or agencies -- so much more --

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.941
in the greater in scale that

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.643
unfortunately even when we've

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.111
seen successes and and the

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.446
implementation of technology

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.781
in other states -- it still has

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.616
remained a big challenge here

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.852
I think it's much for our size

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:04.654
and complexity as as anything

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.389
else I'm not certainly that

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.458
the good work of up all of the

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:11.828
-- State leaders and -- and

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.329
consultants that getting gauged

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.997
in these types of things and

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.033
so and fortunately even the

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.302
successes was you -- report

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.137
-- in other states doesn't

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.372
still gives me concern okay

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:26.709
-- but and here's the thing

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:29.112
at our elections have been

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:32.815
incredibly well run -- that

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.484
given the number of up of

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.885
-- voters that we have been

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.821
registered -- individuals --

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.656
you know it there is set so

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.492
much praise and appreciation

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.360
to our secretary of state

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.329
current and former as well

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.464
as the registrars across the

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:49.932
state that have conducted these

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:52.135
elections in an extraordinarily

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.937
effective and honest way

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.572
-- but we know that it when

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:57.673
you're when you have twenty

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.941
million people voting that

01:02:59.008 --> 01:02:59.742
there's still going to be

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.310
some concerns and problems

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:03.079
and so yes as we look at the

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.047
landscape you know we do see

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.016
some examples of where someone

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.184
might have received a second

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.453
ballot -- and and and there are

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.988
little things and I I stress

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.122
how little they are in the

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.624
context of all that's going

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.559
on in our elections process

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.761
where -- inadvertent mistakes

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:19.929
have occurred and they raise

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.264
questions and with it makes

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.865
all of us uncomfortable when

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:23.799
those questions are raised

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.635
even as in as infinitesimally

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:29.172
small as they may be and so

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.306
and the reason that gives

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:31.674
us concerns is because the

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.176
integrity of our election

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.844
process is foundational to our

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.013
entire democracy we need people

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.515
to have confidence that --

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.184
everything that we do in regard

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.653
to a voter exercising their

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.721
choice is done above board

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.857
transparent and -- and fair

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:49.025
I I know it's the same goals

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:50.726
you have we all have because

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.695
it's so important to our our

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.030
governmental system that we

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.633
have and so once again while I

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.901
share the goals that you have

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.337
laid out in your bill it is the

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.939
confidence level that I think

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.474
we must have -- that is B.

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.842
as gives me pause in regard

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.711
to this bill now I appreciate

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.613
this is the first hearing and

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.248
-- that there is going to be

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.583
a lot of opportunities going

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.084
forward for user and you know

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:16.619
that your great leadership to

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.887
work through these questions

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.223
we hope that DMV and the

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.792
secretary of state -- and other

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.293
stakeholders will engage more

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.661
thoroughly as the bill gets

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:28.864
vetted but I would ask you to

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.400
arrive at it as this bill moves

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:32.702
forward and -- and I'm willing

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:34.270
to support it to move forward

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.872
that I ask you to -- to stay

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.641
connected to our committee

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.776
to stay connected to me and

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.345
to give me some confidence

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.846
going forward that that that

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.581
check and will enable us to if

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.016
necessary caught I don't call

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.318
for applause if it's necessary

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.353
if these questions have been

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:51.487
the result I know you want

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.122
to resolve them to and you're

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.357
very committed to having this

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.492
not just be implemented but to

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.361
work he wanted to work has your

01:04:58.427 --> 01:04:59.695
name on it you wanted to have

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.597
pride and how it's been done

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:03.366
but I would ask you to give

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:04.800
me a little more confidence

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.469
and assurance that that that

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.703
this committee will have that

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.273
opportunity to join you --

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:14.343
in that level of confidence

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.111
all right with that at

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:16.412
any other members have any

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.914
questions or comments enter

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.116
Newman to go back to you for

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.083
clothes and perhaps you can

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.351
address those those issues in

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.586
your clients I I'd be glad to

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.988
Mister so so I I do appreciate

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.089
your concerns I I actually

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.659
share your concerns -- I will

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:30.660
wholeheartedly committed to

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:31.661
working with this committee

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.329
but be you again working with

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:34.930
all stakeholders it did these

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:36.699
are not simple questions to

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.001
solve your is Forest -- these

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.070
kinds of implementations I

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.204
do think it's worthy of I

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.939
would also point out that in

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.242
addition to the DMV's recent

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.444
progress that we as a state or

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.979
the the the the beneficiaries

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.514
of a whole bunch of really

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.715
impressive progress when it

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.983
got at the Secretary state

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.085
level -- in coordination with

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.453
all of the County registration

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.288
moving to the state wide voter

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:00.589
registration database which

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.857
was no small thing in its

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.592
own right so we have in the

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.161
sector states office a willing

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.763
partner -- a gan we have -- but

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.065
I think some good experience

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.566
drawn from other states that

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.002
is relevant -- not withstanding

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.304
California size but to your

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.039
point its original purpose to

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.175
implement a system that does

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.509
not work where that works

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.178
worse than its predecessor and

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.612
so I I share your concern I

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.881
will fully commit -- to work

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.550
with all stakeholders moving

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:28.818
forward and pulling The bill

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.152
back if necessary if we don't

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:30.953
have your insurance that we

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.521
can make that promise so with

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.190
that I asked respectfully for

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:35.558
an aye vote today so just to

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:36.892
clarify if you feel that this

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:38.227
committee feels that as the

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.528
bill moves forward it hasn't

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.464
been put in that that shape

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.631
to have that confidence on the

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.966
operational side that you will

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.267
bring it back to this committee

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.702
for further discussion to be

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:47.937
clear I would have been make

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.038
the commitment to reflect

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.873
okay -- any other comments or

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.676

bill enjoys that the support of

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.896
three members we have to absent

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.130
and we'll wait to level for

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.365
the long call and wait for them

to join us later this morning

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.705
okay so we are going to move

01:07:56.772 --> 01:08:00.276
on now to SB six six zero for

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:01.577
those people paying attention

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.879
at home -- this is six six

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.648
zero we have one more bill

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.183
by senator Newman after that

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.451
which is six six three but

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.752
we're going to focus right now

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:13.622
on this bill SB six six zero

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:14.957
senator Newman we welcome you

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.592
back to our community and we

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.793
would welcome your testimony

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.662
on this bill Mr sure it's good

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:20.629
to be back I feel like I was

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:23.999
never way -- and and I have the

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.167
this is a mixed blessing today

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.136
of having for bills some of

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.772
which have the same digits so

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:30.973
the last one had a three and it

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.675
would seem to get too confusing

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.743
because this has to six is --

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.544
but this bill is S.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:39.114
B. six six zero -- and -- it

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:40.950
is very different than the bill

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.084
that will follow six X.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.153
three Mister Sanders I am here

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.554
before today advocating on

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.490
behalf of SB six six zero under

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.358
its provisions by eliminating

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:51.393
common practices in gathering

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.862
signatures for ballot measures

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.029
which incentivize the willful

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.532
deception of voters SB six six

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:58.167
year will will make necessary

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.235
important steps towards

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.169
safeguarding the integrity

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.670
of California's initiative

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.906
referendum and recall process

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.474
sees California's one of

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.342
a number of states whose

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.743
constitutions expressly

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.378
provided citizens with tools

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.679
to directly redress abuses

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.314
of government or malfeasance

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.549
by public officials in the

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:14.583
form of the initiative the

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.986
referendum in the recall first

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.087
some historical background

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.788
and context if you may be

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:20.923
aware these admirable and

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.157
useful constitution director

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.292
Marcus you provisions date

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.094
back more than a century and

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.328
are the result of the efforts

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.229
of a group of progressive

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.597
reformers led by then governor

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.332
Hiram Johnson who then went

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.333
on to become California's

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.668
longest serving represented

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:33.502
the United States Senate

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.104
until -- with twenty eight

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.373
years in office until recently

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.407
being eclipsed by our own

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:40.476
senator Dianne Feinstein as a

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:41.977
result of the heroic efforts

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:42.945
of governor Johnson and

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.146
his supporters California's

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:45.714
constitution through the

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:46.849
initial referendum a recall

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.751
makes explicit provisions that

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.252
allow for the citizenry to take

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.820
actions outside of the normal

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:53.622
legislative process in order to

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.724
enact repeal legislation or to

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.192
remove a corrupt or malfeasance

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.928
elected official from office

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.329
but let me point out before

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.864
I get into the meat of this

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.532
this bill and its provisions

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.134
have nothing whatsoever to

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.702
do with the current effort to

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.704
recall are sitting governor

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.539
that has no urgency provision

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.241
-- and so it's passage will

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.542
have no impact at all on

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.744
that process let me go back

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.112
to built to the original

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:18.213
framers way of thinking the

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.281
initiative referendum and

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:20.983
recall represented a means

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.284
for the little guy to chief

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.619
directorate of and reformist

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.454
actions that elected invested

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.889
interest might otherwise thwart

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:27.823
because the framers of the

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.924
initial referendum a recall

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.125
regarding these processes as

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:32.294
populist actions of last resort

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.295
they deliberately provided

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.930
that in order to qualify for

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:35.965
the ballot the proponents

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.032
of any of these direct to

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.667
the voters plebiscites would

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:40.069
first be required to gather

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:41.503
a sufficient number of voter

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.405
signatures to validate the

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.474
legitimacy and popular support

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.076
for such an action over the

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.410
years and especially in recent

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:50.179
decades however something very

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:51.146
different than the framers

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.549
intent has transpired these

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:54.783
tools are Director moxie have

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.085
been effectively co opted by

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.620
the very money interest they

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:58.721
were originally created to

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:00.656
offset as these well funded

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:01.890
groups with it increasingly

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.158
explicit self interested

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.059
motivations have become

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:05.494
ever more adept at using the

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.395
initiative referendum and

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:07.963
recall process he's to their

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.298
benefit something of an arms

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.599
race around the processes

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.267
has ensued especially as it

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:14.103
pertains to signature gathering

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.604
at the center of these efforts

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.039
the small number of specialized

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.273
firms with expertise in

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.808
signature gathering have risen

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.876
to the fore offering their

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.745
services to proponents seeking

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:23.846
to place a measure on the

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.848
ballot and any given time one

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:27.049
of the principal tactics used

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.183
by the specialized things are

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.885
getting firms is the deployment

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.153
of well trained professional

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.921
signature gatherers typically

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:33.889
the signature gathers are

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.524
paid on a per signature or

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.326
commission basis also known as

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.228
a bounty at a rate determined

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.896
by the market as it is assessed

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.665
at that time depending on

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:43.866
the nature of the initiative

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:44.767
The characterised of the

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.101
district the time of year or

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.603
competition with other nations

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.104
either within the state or

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.372
in other states at that time

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:51.774
the cost procedure can vary

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.342
widely from as low as two

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:54.510
dollars per signature gathered

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:55.744
to as high as twenty dollars

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.246
in some cases and because

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.614
bounty paid signatures are

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.282
incentivized to optimize their

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:01.950
yield based on how rapidly

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.118
they can secure signatures from

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.887
voters they frequently traffic

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.221
and misdirection misleading

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.756
information and outright

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.124
falsehoods in order to reduce

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.693
as many voters as possible

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.127
to sign in the minimum out of

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.463
time thereby increasing their

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.465
yield against this backdrop

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.633
the determining factor getting

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.734
a measure on the ballot too

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.935
often has less to do with its

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.037
policy merits then the depth of

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.939
it's promote proponents pockets

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.507
of course this is exactly the

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:26.809
opposite of what the framers

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.544
originally had in mind as

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.611
the direct result of these

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.879
perverse incentives the paper

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.147
signature system has subverted

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:34.116
the original idealistic content

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.484
of California's founders

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.585
who envisioned a people

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.053
powered system of referenda

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.055
in propositions validated by

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.323
demonstrated public support

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.758
and would succeed or fail on

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.526
their merits not on what how

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.361
well the system can be gamed

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:47.396
the initiative referendum and

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.298
recall processes can and should

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:50.566
play an important value role

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.134
in California politics and

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.235
government this coming from

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.104
somebody who has been recall it

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.538
has become clear however that

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.173
under the current system driven

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.408
by persons you're bounties

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.442
there are scant prospects

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:02.177
for to turn bad actors who

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.445
willfully mislead voters at

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.980
the expense of the integrity

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.448
of the electoral process SB

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:08.350
six sixty addresses this issue

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.551
by prohibiting the practice of

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.186
paying signature gatherers on a

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.055
personal basis when collecting

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.623
signatures to place a state

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.924
or local initiative referendum

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.659
or recall on the ballot this

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.027
measure aye I should be clear

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.729
would not prohibit payment

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:21.930
for signature gathering that

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.098
is not based on the number of

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.733
signatures obtained Shigure

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.335
gathers still could be paid an

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.437
hourly wage or salary as the

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:30.339
proponents see fit this bill

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:31.507
will provide assurance and

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.242
transparency to the voters and

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:34.243
it's enforcement provisions

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.344
will permit both the Attorney

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.112
General and any person to

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.180
bring a civil claim under

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.515
this section for procedure

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.750
payment practices employers

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:42.751
which is to say those who

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.052
employs signature gathers who

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.320
violate the provisions of SB

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.989
six sixty would be subject to

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:48.223
a fine of twenty five thousand

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.491
dollars or fifty dollars per

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.493
signature fraudulent gathered

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.694
whichever amount is greater

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.229
if that is proving this

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.297
good government measure will

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:56.565
serve to strengthen a recall

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.200
referendum and issue processes

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.668
by ensuring that voters are

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.003
aware of exactly what they're

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.104
signing and are not being

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.672
deceived ultimately SB six

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.007
sixty will help to restore

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:06.975
faith in our elections and our

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.011
nation processes other states

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.612
such as Colorado Montana and

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:11.980
Oregon have already examined

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.315
the issues surrounding facing

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.850
she gathers and of adopted

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:15.918
legislation prohibiting

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.586
procedure about two payments

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:18.654
require that payment fishing

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.155
together make may only be made

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.457
on an hourly or a salary based

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.992
it is time for California to do

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.094
the same our democracy and our

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:27.529
governments and our politics

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:28.931
will be the better for it I

making -- money per signature

he said with prop twenty two

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.669
it is harming more people who

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.738
are self employed and trying

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.640

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.678
deal an impact to any recall

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.880
that you have to have people

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.615

missed your show is so good

that the when the colors as

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:04.591
if I had persons transfer the

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:06.693
recall I think those who are

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.795
familiar California politics

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.963
not know that I have -- but

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.032
let me see very clearly I I'm

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:13.567
actually did serve despite that

01:41:13.634 --> 01:41:16.203
experience -- a firm believer

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.704
-- in these constitutional

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.072
tools vertically when used

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:20.307
appropriately and when used

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:23.744
honestly up to some of the

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:26.447
witnesses who have spoken --

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:28.515
in reference to eighty five

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:29.716
I actually do appreciate that

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:32.019
concern -- but I I would point

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.020
out that that's what we're

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.221
in different to do here is

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:36.690
not to prevent anybody from

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.726
working -- it is it is not to

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:41.462
change A. N. N. A.

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:42.830
center gathers relationship

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:44.665
to their employer I think

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:45.766
that's a very separate set of

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.701
questions as it relates to --

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.703
independent contracting what we

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.006
are trying to do is to remove

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:55.409
the incentive to expedite

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:56.610
the gathered signatures at

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:59.213
the expense of the truth --

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.381
and I think in particular and

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.483
local initiatives that are

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:05.185
funded by outside groups that

01:42:05.252 --> 01:42:07.855
is a common observation that

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.056
professional signature gathers

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:11.225
in in sort of their diligent

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.926
work to maximize their hourly

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:16.897
return are sometimes less than

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:19.032
ethical less than clear in

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:20.834
the representations there's

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.302
nothing about this bill that

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:23.904
would prevent a signature

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.572
gathering operation from

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:28.075
paying the people who they've

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:29.977
engaged to collect signatures

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.545
-- and I think that's that's

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:33.914
important to note that having

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:38.051
said that -- what we want in

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:41.588
our initiative process is the

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:44.458
assurance that if and when a

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:46.727
measure reaches the threshold

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:48.795
to qualify for the ballot that

01:42:48.862 --> 01:42:50.764
that that is done honestly and

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:53.333
in so doing that represents the

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.868
sentiment the true sentiment

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:59.039
of the voters I and as such it

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:00.541
does the work that the framers

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:02.643
intended which is to validate

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.778
the the legitimacy -- and

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.747
the import of the the action

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.882
being taken those things that

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:11.618
run counter to that -- tend

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:13.153
to corrode our faith in these

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.188
processes -- and so that's my

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:17.024
goal here is not to restrict

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.092
in any way -- the public or

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:20.561
any particular groups right

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:23.230
to exercise -- these tools

01:43:23.297 --> 01:43:24.531
but to ensure when they are

01:43:24.598 --> 01:43:26.667
employed -- that the public

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:27.968
in each voter that is campus

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.703
has the assurance that they're

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:32.372
participating in an honest open

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.508
and ethical process that's to

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:37.010
the good for our our state for

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:39.146
our democracy for a politics

01:43:39.212 --> 01:43:40.514
-- five other states have

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:42.749
implemented laws very similar

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:45.052
to this again it does not

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:46.620
prevent signature gathers from

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:48.255
being pages not prevent groups

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:49.189
from paying their signature

01:43:49.256 --> 01:43:51.291
gathers what it does do is is

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:53.226
align incentives with ethical

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:55.095
behavior -- and with that

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:56.163
I respectfully ask your aye

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:58.131
vote today thank you senator

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:59.933
Newman -- I've appreciated the

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.335
conversations that we've had

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.003
-- offline on on this issue

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.706
and certainly -- going through

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:06.940
what you have gone through

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:11.044
I appreciate -- how -- it

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:13.180
important the integrity of this

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:14.448
process says and I know that

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:15.248
we're going to hear another

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:17.184
bill in a few minutes about

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.119
the recall petition -- which I

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.687
think for me at least is headed

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:21.555
and they were in the right

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.290
direction for trying to deal

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:24.958
with that some of the concerns

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.293
that you raise and none of us

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.729
want to see this representation

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.497
-- with that yeah for me at

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:31.798
least it we assume that per

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:34.167
provisions that are in our laws

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:36.603
that that -- allow for someone

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:38.105
to be prosecuted for for

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.706
Mississippi and misleading and

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.642
what they do and the dilemma

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:44.778
for me is that while we share

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:49.116
the same aims -- I I think that

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:50.784
at the end of the day that the

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:52.219
this measure is going to raise

01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:53.720
the cost and create greater

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:55.989
barriers to qualify measures

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:57.324
and that I think that's why

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:58.592
that's why three previous

01:44:58.659 --> 01:45:00.527
governors at that cited to veto

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:03.563
similar bills to this and --

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:04.931
also the the fact that there's

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:06.533
a private right of action here

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.268
creates a lot of concern for me

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.103
of creating a an incentive on

01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:12.639
the opposite side someone who

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:14.341
sees a personal profit to --

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:16.510
to prosecute cases that would

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:18.879
be allowed under this bill also

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:20.347
for me as troubling and and Y.

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:21.481
reluctantly I'm not gonna be

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.350
able to support it today -- but

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:24.451
I appreciate all the good work

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.686
that you have put in this area

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:26.853
and I know and a moment we're

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.422
going to hear another bill that

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:29.656
I think it tries to advance

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:30.924
some of the goals that you have

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.926
to establish I do know that

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:34.361
-- are Committee short is that

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:35.829
members are in other committees

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:37.531
with other obligations and

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:38.565
so I guess what I would ask

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:40.734
is to hold this -- as we wait

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:42.202
for other members to join and

01:45:42.269 --> 01:45:43.170
we'll see if there's a motion

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.971
to -- to advance this -- in

01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:46.873
a few minutes okay with that

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.108
certainly anything you wanna

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.342
St close when I make sure you

01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:51.078
get that opportunity I I want

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.412
to just touch on on your point

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:53.447
regarding the private right of

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.882
action -- and yeah you know I

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.350
appreciate the kind of the red

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.653
flag that that tends to rage at

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.855
but I will say in not just my

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:02.823
experience but the experience

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:05.392
of of of of many recall efforts

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.260
at where a patient you guys

01:46:07.327 --> 01:46:09.496
might not have been -- you know

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:11.898
so fully ethical there is a

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:13.467
dilemma and it's it's already

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:14.768
as you I think alluded to it's

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.636
already expressly illegal to

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:18.872
to intention mislead a voter as

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:20.173
to the nature intent of issues

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.008
you're getting process but as

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:22.943
it turns out there's there's

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:24.945
virtually no possibility of

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:26.947
enforcement -- as a practical

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:29.282
matter -- day in it you know

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:30.383
it's not surprising when you

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.318
think about it so we give

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:33.019
great latitude free speech

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:34.755
I in the conduct of politics

01:46:34.821 --> 01:46:36.022
the problem more importantly

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:37.991
most of those who would be

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.393
-- charged with enforcing --

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.395
that particular statute are

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:44.564
themselves political actors are

01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.600
themselves subject to elections

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:47.934
I and so they're they're very

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:50.437
disinclined to take steps

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:53.006
even when -- sort of important

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:55.075
to do so -- and so the you

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:57.711
know so that's the basis for

01:46:57.778 --> 01:46:59.713
that effort but they're also

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.148
problems with admissibility of

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.816
evidence that as it turns out

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.851
you you could if you recorded

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:06.620
a signature gather on on your

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.922
cell phone -- making a clear

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:10.490
reference misrepresentation

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.225
that evidence indicate Uniserve

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.360
standard coffee prices would

01:47:13.426 --> 01:47:15.128
not be admissible in court

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:16.363
I into it creates a catch

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:18.732
twenty two where if you know

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:20.100
practitioners of six you got

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.635
and are willing to bend the law

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:22.769
there's very little recourse

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.604
under current law despite the

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.540
nominal -- probation on the

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.475
misdemeanor penalty so it so

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:30.544
that's the basis for that --

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:33.079
again to be clear -- you know

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:34.281
these are all very useful tools

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:35.415
what we're trying to do is to

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:37.250
strengthen them -- and into

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:38.685
your your concern I think it's

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:40.120
it's a it's a concern shared

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.255
by others as to whether not

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:44.991
this might raise the cost of

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.860
of -- do you know serve these

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:49.095
sorts of efforts -- I'm not

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.497
sure that's clear -- but I

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:52.165
would say that that we do want

01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:54.267
the assurance that that people

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:55.802
participating in these clips

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:58.505
across these are properly --

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:02.142
-- -- informed -- and so if you

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:07.447
work for instance -- trying to

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:09.916
serious popular support that

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:11.318
would be a kind of any material

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.819
can concerns right because you

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:13.920
would have no shortage of you

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.188
know volunteers Energy we've

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:17.757
seen that quite recently -- but

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:18.825
in those cases where there's

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:21.628
a used a moneyed interest it

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:22.963
actually works completely in

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:25.665
their favor -- and and against

01:48:25.732 --> 01:48:27.033
perhaps in some cases the

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.769
interest of other less -- you

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:32.706
know Shiv -- well endowed I

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.541
constituencies because if you

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:37.510
have six million dollars or

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:38.511
let's go the other way if you

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.512
have an initiative you want to

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.147
bring to the ballot -- and you

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:42.649
talk to a a signature gathering

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:43.650
firm they tell you what the

01:48:43.717 --> 01:48:45.485
going price might be and say

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:47.287
you need to gather the million

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.122
six of signatures and it's it's

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.290
it's they give the going rate

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.192
is five dollars for a signature

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:53.360
well you know progress eight

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:54.361
million dollars if you have a

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:55.929
million dollars it's basically

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:57.664
a done deal right would you

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:58.565
know that the market when

01:48:58.632 --> 01:48:59.699
working officially you'll get

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:00.667
those strangers if you can

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:03.336
pay for them in in many cases

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.604
that you don't even have to do

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.640
it -- as we are taking to the

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.041
recent bill and privacy simply

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:10.076
the threat to do so it's enough

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.711
to compel the Legislature into

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.313
action and compromised that's

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.448
clearly counter to what the

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:16.783
original framers intended by

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.785
way of these tools so that you

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:19.619
know there's there's always

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:20.553
another side but I wanted in

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:22.155
this case that this is all on

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:24.024
balance to the good -- and my

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.191
hope is that it will be support

01:49:25.258 --> 01:49:26.860
today that thank you senator

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:27.994
Newman and I think you make a

01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:30.363
very good point -- in regard

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:31.932
to the enforcement question

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:34.234
and it goes beyond this issue

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:36.336
two other issues of -- of

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:37.504
where we put private right

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:39.205
of action and other places in

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:42.542
our in our codes -- because

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:44.044
of a lack of confidence that

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:46.279
our public law enforcement

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.181
community which were has direct

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:49.950
line responsibility and as

01:49:50.016 --> 01:49:51.318
proposed in your bill and other

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:54.220
places -- have not stepped up

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:56.323
as they should and he raise a

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:57.390
number of issues that I think

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:59.292
are legitimate -- issues in

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:01.394
that space and I wanna I wanna

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:03.563
make knowledge that I would

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:06.800
note that -- the petition

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:08.768
process is simply one part

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:12.772
of the -- if you will action

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:14.341
process that the end of the day

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:15.942
the voters -- if L.

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:18.144
one was successful -- would

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.646
still have to provide their

01:50:19.713 --> 01:50:21.881
judgment and that we do know

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:23.450
that you know how the money

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.684
can influence that process

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:27.420
to I guess I have from my own

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:29.289
experience I would say that

01:50:29.356 --> 01:50:31.124
if you have a a a and a deep

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:32.359
pocket financial interests

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:33.727
that they're gonna be a lot

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.762
easier for them to pay someone

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:38.164
-- by the hour -- and afford

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:39.833
that versus for the signature

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:41.134
than some other interest that

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.470
maybe not as as well funded I

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.804
appreciate that there can be

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.840
reasonable -- the people on all

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.308
sides of that question it's not

01:50:48.375 --> 01:50:50.010
an easy one to unnecessarily

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:52.512
prudent -- certainly it it's

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:54.881
at the heart of the that you

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:57.150
feel is the disincentive for

01:50:57.217 --> 01:50:58.184
things to be done right and

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:00.220
I appreciate that and -- and

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:02.222
appreciate the expertise he

01:51:02.288 --> 01:51:04.224
experiences that you have that

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.926
are -- that deep and meaningful

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:09.429
and I think -- -- provide your

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:10.830
leadership in this space and

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:13.833
I admired and respected okay

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.068
with that without that scene

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.136
if there's any other colleagues

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.904
who wish to make a comment

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.539
about this I don't see any

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:21.274
hands going up I think we're

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:22.409
going to do on this is just

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:23.710
a for it for a few minutes to

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:25.512
wait for members to come back

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:26.513
into Committee and see where

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:27.981
they want to they want to take

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:29.549
it all right so with that we're

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:30.483
just gonna put that one on

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:33.219
hold that was SB six six zero

01:51:33.286 --> 01:51:36.022
-- and -- we're gonna move on

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:39.726
on our agenda item number six

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:42.228
hi this is a legislation by

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.363
a friend of this committee

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.733
senator Newman -- and it is a

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:47.834
different numbers of those who

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:49.669
are paying attention please

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:51.604
do so now this is SB six six

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:53.540
three is a lot of excitement

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.208
early in the hearing and this

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:57.544
may be a moment to -- to step

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:58.978
up and and share your views on

01:51:59.045 --> 01:52:00.380
that as we hear this bill so

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:01.981
senate-room and we welcome your

01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:05.385
comments on SB six six three

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:08.021
thank you Mister chair -- I

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:10.156
diss the bill the S. B.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:11.324
six six three which apparently

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:13.326
has instigated so much interest

01:52:13.393 --> 01:52:14.894
-- I am here before you to

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.963
advocate on its behalf SB

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:18.298
six six three will protect

01:52:18.364 --> 01:52:19.332
the integrity California's

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:20.567
current constitution able

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.735
processes for recalling a state

01:52:22.802 --> 01:52:24.337
elected space sitting alike

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:25.538
that official by addressing a

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:27.440
deterring unethical practices

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:28.641
in the collection of signatures

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.776
toward qualifying the recall

01:52:29.843 --> 01:52:31.778
effort by allowing the target

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:33.113
of that ever the opportunity

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:34.180
to communicate directly with

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:35.248
voters whose signatures may

01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:36.816
have been fraudulently or

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.985
misleadingly secured as part

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.253
of an effort as noted in my

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.122
earlier testimony California is

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:43.456
one of a number of states whose

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:45.058
constitutions express revived

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.192
the public to have recourse

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:47.527
to directly redress abuse of

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.129
government or malfeasance by

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:50.563
public officials in the form of

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.132
the initiative the referendum

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:54.267
in the recall this bills deal

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:55.835
specifically and exclusively

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:57.804
with the recall process and I

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.539
will point out at the outset

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.274
this bill has no urgency

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.443
provision if signed into law

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.644
it will not go into effect

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:06.579
until next year as such it

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.948
will have no impact whatsoever

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.250
on the current recall effort

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:12.952
against governor Newsom voters

01:53:13.019 --> 01:53:14.254
signed petitions protecting

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.655
the high traffic locations were

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:16.723
professional singers together

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.158
set up rarely take the time

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.059
to read the actual text of a

01:53:20.126 --> 01:53:22.028
petition instead rely quite

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:23.463
often upon the representations

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.031
of the signature gatherers

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:26.299
this means you surgery gathers

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:27.367
often operate without any

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.968
sort of transparency routinely

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.003
and systematically misleading

01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:31.604
voters about not only the

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:33.573
rationale but the process and

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.041
with little if any concern

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.843
about legal repercussions the

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:38.011
current law allows for voters

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.112
to withdraw their signatures

01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:40.146
from recall petition the

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:42.148
success withdrawal seizures is

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:43.550
for all intents and purposes

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:44.918
largely impossible for most

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:47.420
voters for two primary reasons

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.022
first request for signature

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.290
withdrawals must be received

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:52.458
by elections officials before

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:53.826
the signature is submitted

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:55.295
to election officials for

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:56.863
validation yet the voter is

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.865
rarely if ever aware of when

01:53:58.932 --> 01:53:59.999
the petition signatures will

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:01.467
be submitted as and they are

01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:04.370
often done on a rolling basis

01:54:04.437 --> 01:54:06.039
second once a recall petition

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:07.373
has been signed in process to

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.775
voter has no practical way of

01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:09.943
finding out whether he or she

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:11.611
might have been deceived into

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:12.745
signing a petition because

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:13.780
no one other than elections

01:54:13.846 --> 01:54:15.682
officials not even the target

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.083
of a recall effort is currently

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.751
permitted under existing law

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:20.119
to inspect the signatures

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.021
or the names on a particular

01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:24.257
petition as a consequence the

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:25.558
target recall even where there

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:26.926
is clear evidence of unethical

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:28.094
activity in the collection

01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:29.896
of those signatures is it an

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.631
immense an unfair disadvantage

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.633
in trying to offset that effort

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.934
and to prevent the proponents

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.302
of the of the opportunity to

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:37.403
reach the prescribed number

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.504
of qualifying signatures by

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:40.540
canvassing petition signers and

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:41.774
asking them to rescind their

01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:42.775
signatures from particular

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:44.210
recall petitions if they

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:46.412
have been misinformed SB six

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:47.347
six three would provide the

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:49.148
target recall petition the

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:51.951
very very closely circumcised

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:53.253
opportunity to examine

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:54.420
submitted signatures while the

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:56.055
liberal establishing guardrails

01:54:56.122 --> 01:54:57.457
around how the target recall

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:59.125
may use information obtained

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.293
for the petition transparency

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.628
measure adopted through

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:03.496
this bill As sharpened by

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:04.631
the amendments proposed by

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:05.698
committee staff under the

01:55:05.765 --> 01:55:07.800
transit SB six six three the

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.102
target of a recall effort will

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.470
be limited to using petitions

01:55:10.536 --> 01:55:12.305
singer information only to

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:13.640
win sure the voters understood

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:14.674
the petition when they signed

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:16.276
it and doing the support

01:55:16.342 --> 01:55:18.111
the goals of the petition if

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:18.945
orders include they've been

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:20.513
deceived into signing SB six

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.414
six three that provides a

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.249
pathway and a time line to

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:24.550
assist voters in withdrawing

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:26.419
their signatures the opposition

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:27.553
will assert that making the

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.721
allowance for the target of

01:55:28.788 --> 01:55:30.423
a recall effort to counter

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:31.457
petition those who assigned

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:33.426
to somehow and violation of

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.794
the signers privacy and would

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:35.595
leave them vulnerable to

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.797
ration and retaliation not only

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.698
do the amendments and other

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:39.732
provisions ensure that this

01:55:39.799 --> 01:55:41.634
won't happen it's also true

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:43.102
that the overall rationale the

01:55:43.169 --> 01:55:44.437
original restaurant rationale

01:55:44.504 --> 01:55:45.872
for restricting access to reap

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:47.874
recall petition actually had

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.375
nothing to do with insulating

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:51.044
a target from its target

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.578
rather these provisions were

01:55:52.645 --> 01:55:54.080
intended to prevent subsequent

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:55.315
misuse of the petition and

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:56.983
its information by others

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.284
whose aims were unrelated

01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:00.186
to the original effort under

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.287
the logic of the framers of

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:03.156
California's recall process

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:04.424
and ever to remove a sitting

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.591
elected official to recall

01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:07.026
was meant to be something of a

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:09.429
trial by ballot if you will it

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:10.563
is a fundamental tenet of the

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.531
American justice system that

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.166
the accused should always have

01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:14.534
the right to face his or her

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.302
accusers this is what we're

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:18.771
endeavoring to do nothing more

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.106
nothing less than that to that

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.808
end California petition process

01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:23.443
should be respected honest and

01:56:23.509 --> 01:56:24.811
provide voters with confidence

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:25.745
that their seizures do not

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:27.547
result from nor contribute

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.715
to the misrepresentation

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:30.516
distortion of the basis on

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:31.984
which the recall from office

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:34.020
is currently being sought if

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:35.054
the means by which features a

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:36.556
collective qualifying are less

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:37.623
than ethical it undermines

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:38.624
the validity of the recall

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:40.093
effort and brings into question

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.194
the value of the signatures

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.562
gathered in the conduct of that

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:44.364
effort providing the target of

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:45.732
the recall with the opportunity

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:46.766
to communicate with petition

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:47.700
signers seem reasonable

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:49.302
and fair while respecting

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.470
and protecting the signers

01:56:50.536 --> 01:56:52.338
including for retaliation

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:53.306
and that's more than just

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:54.273
by considering the serious

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.142
implications of a recall

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:57.477
effort I would like to thank

protect the privacy of signers

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.816
and defined the terms on which

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:04.984
these sorts of process will

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:07.053
take place with that would also

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.788
prohibit disclosure of personal

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.990

any kind of retaliation

01:57:15.261 --> 01:57:17.096

think it's necessary given

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:25.838
kind of the nature of the

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:27.373
interest in this bill This

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.841
bill anomaly has nothing to

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:30.009
do with the current effort

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:32.378
directed against our governor

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:33.846
I will also say this bill is

01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:35.114
not to be relevant to those

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:37.383
efforts aye aye will accord

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:38.951
-- the organizers of that

01:57:39.018 --> 01:57:41.220
effort all the respect is due

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:42.388
because they have been nothing

01:57:42.455 --> 01:57:44.424
if not direct and honest

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.459
with the people of California

01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:47.794
anybody who is signed it their

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.395
petition probably has a very

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:50.630
clear understanding as to

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:52.331
what they're asking and why

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.333
and in this case did not to

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.435
take the role of the aims of

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:58.971
my bill my bill actually it's

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:01.174

represented to the signers --

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:09.081
and as such the target recall

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:10.283

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:53.459
to the target and self and

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:54.794
they actually would walk away

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.363
from the tables -- and turn

02:03:57.429 --> 02:04:00.232
away from participating in

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:02.201
the lawful peaceful petition

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:03.569
gathering process their first

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:05.437
amendment right because they're

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.040
afraid of retaliation and

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:11.343
retribution this is a dangerous

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.946
and reckless bill that would

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:18.050
give the target of a recall

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.219
access to all of that data all

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:22.721
that personal information and

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:25.591
it would stifle the process

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:28.260
that the constitutional process

02:04:28.327 --> 02:04:29.929
that people are guaranteed

02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:31.230
it would disenfranchise the

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:34.800
voters of the state and -- it

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.969
would basically just notify

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:38.704
the petition gathering process

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:42.308
for recalls as a whole so

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:44.510
there's there's a reason that

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:46.879
-- you know in California the

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:49.014
California constitution section

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.217
seven article two says that

02:04:51.283 --> 02:04:54.854
voting has to be secret okay

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:57.022
and you know why it has to be

02:04:57.089 --> 02:04:58.858
secret because you don't want

02:04:58.924 --> 02:05:00.893
to allow undue influence on

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:03.329
the population with the with

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:06.565
the political figures right and

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:09.802
then -- you have -- government

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:12.872
code sixty five three that

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:14.473
says that signatures need

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.842
to be private kept private

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:18.010
on the petition gathering

02:05:18.077 --> 02:05:20.212
process even I can't look at

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:21.580
signatures after they've been

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:24.683
put on the petition okay those

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:27.887
are taken away and this bill

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:30.856
would open up the signatures

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:32.057
and the personal information

02:05:32.124 --> 02:05:33.492
for the people that signed

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:36.562
it to a third party because

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:38.397
just the target isn't the only

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:39.498
one who's gonna be looking

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:41.400
at this data and information

02:05:41.467 --> 02:05:42.401
they're gonna have an entire

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:44.003
crew if you're gonna campus

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:46.472
over two million signatures

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.340
then there's an entire crew

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:50.342
and the likelihood of that

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:51.744
information being leaked out

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.746
business owners and you know

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:55.014
personal information things

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.782
like that being leaked out into

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.751
the public it just expands that

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:01.553
danger it's reckless and it's

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.355
a dangerous bill and Mister

02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:04.423

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:11.656
is someone who has participated

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:13.925

people that I have encountered

02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:25.203
in those thirty years did not

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:27.738
have pure intentions and -- in

02:27:27.805 --> 02:27:29.707
some cases well I mean I let's

02:27:29.774 --> 02:27:31.676
just say it when when the you

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:33.611

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:37.848
didn't know what I was signing

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:39.450
people lie to me people told

02:27:39.517 --> 02:27:41.385
me it was about something else

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:43.120
I mean it does happen all the

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:46.057
time -- so I support the bill I

02:27:46.123 --> 02:27:47.925
appreciate you bring it forward

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:49.293

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.395
that you took in order to help

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:52.430
make it a little more a little

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:53.931
cleaner a little more straight

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.766

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.002

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:01.205
thank you center Leyva any

02:28:01.272 --> 02:28:02.540

from committee members

02:28:07.111 --> 02:28:08.145

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.415
Newman would you like to close

-- I thank you Mr chairman so

02:28:15.052 --> 02:28:17.955
I do appreciate the concerns

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:19.523
articulated by the witnesses

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:21.425
not just here but -- on the

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:24.962
phone as well -- and I want

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:25.763
to speak a little bit of this

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.932
notion of privacy rights so

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:30.501
the the ballot in America is

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.470
secret -- and that is kind of

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.672
a hallowed sacred tradition

02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:37.875
but participation in politics

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:40.978
is not intended to be secret

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:43.114
or anonymous and again and

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:44.782
-- I I would point you back

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:46.984
to the intent and thinking

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:48.853
of the original framers of

02:28:48.919 --> 02:28:51.589
these measures clearly I mean

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.190
that was a different time

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:55.259
and place the only senator

02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:56.627
Nielsen was alive at that

02:28:56.694 --> 02:29:02.266
time I'm kidding Jim but

02:29:02.333 --> 02:29:06.437
but it's it's --

02:29:06.504 --> 02:29:08.706
what we're trying to do here is

02:29:08.773 --> 02:29:10.908
to create effective deterrence

02:29:10.975 --> 02:29:12.243
as much as anything right to

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:14.578
center lowest point and into

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:16.047
my early point I mean I cannot

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:19.016
I will accord the proponents

02:29:19.083 --> 02:29:21.218

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:38.803
be extremely thorough on the

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:40.671
the types of amendments taken

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:41.706
in the can of the forms as a

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:43.974
manage would take I and I'm

02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:44.909
gonna run down the list really

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:46.077
quickly right and it's it's to

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:47.378
provide exactly the assurance

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:49.013
that I think you're seeking I

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:50.414
on the one hand work which we

02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:53.417
exempts small jurisdictions if

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:56.053
the recall target represents a

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:57.421
a a community of of the fewer

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:58.756
than fifty thousand registered

02:29:58.823 --> 02:29:59.890
voter that's not population

02:29:59.957 --> 02:30:01.692
that voters so it's obviously

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.461
much larger out we want to

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:04.595
make sure that that that

02:30:04.662 --> 02:30:06.964
that's a small town -- that's

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:07.865
where people might know each

02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:09.000
other might be subject to the

02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:10.101
kinds of retaliation I think

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:11.602
if you're concerned about --

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:12.937
and so we've created a line to

02:30:13.003 --> 02:30:15.106
exempt -- did it communities

02:30:15.172 --> 02:30:17.842
below a certain size we we we

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:18.943
will not let people see the

02:30:19.009 --> 02:30:20.378
signatures right we do you

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:21.946
know what to do we respect a

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:23.247
person identified information

02:30:23.314 --> 02:30:25.516
prevent identity fraud it The

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:27.685
bill prohibits disclosure -- it

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:28.953
prohibits the trying to recall

02:30:29.019 --> 02:30:30.354
the represents from sharing

02:30:30.421 --> 02:30:31.655
that petitioners goes in the

02:30:31.722 --> 02:30:34.658
name of a signer it includes a

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:35.960
number of other recall petition

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:37.495
list protections -- and I won't

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:40.264
go them to now it requires the

02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.533
use pledge by a recall target

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:43.734
-- and the representatives to

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:46.137
to submit in writing -- upon

02:30:46.203 --> 02:30:48.773
a penalty of a misdemeanor

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:50.074
-- that they wanted to use

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:52.343
that information in any form

02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:53.444
and again I can I give the

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:56.013
committee credit for working to

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.148
live really to create the kinds

02:30:57.214 --> 02:30:58.449
assurances that I think people

02:30:58.516 --> 02:31:00.317
are speaking to but then again

02:31:00.384 --> 02:31:01.852
I will come back to this notion

02:31:01.919 --> 02:31:05.589
that you know politics and and

02:31:05.656 --> 02:31:07.458
you know public debate is is

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:10.394
inherently Public and that's

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:12.630
not a bad thing I also point

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:15.766
out that is that -- what for

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:17.301
the most part you know there

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:18.502
is this is sort of a paradox

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:20.738
here that -- you you the the

02:31:20.805 --> 02:31:22.273
-- opposition looking for Sir

02:31:22.339 --> 02:31:24.475
insurance of anonymity privacy

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:25.843
when in fact that many of the

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:28.112
same people are Kinks dreamily

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:30.114
active on social media -- and

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:32.616
extremely public -- and so I

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:33.617
would point out that if the

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:34.952
government California were

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:36.454
interested in retaliating he

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:37.822
be doing so right now it's not

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:39.757
that hard to find -- the you

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:40.991
know the proponents the active

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:43.594
supporters of this measure and

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:44.995
so again what we're trying to

02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:48.132
do is to to create a deterrent

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:50.568
structure so that in the event

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:52.670
of a recall effort there is an

02:31:52.736 --> 02:31:54.972
incentive to act honorably I

02:31:55.039 --> 02:31:56.941
even if that that conversation

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:58.776
is uncomfortable right because

02:31:58.843 --> 02:31:59.610
the you know the can that's

02:31:59.677 --> 02:32:01.111
in the nature of our politics

02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:02.580
not everything's competently

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:04.748
given how divided our culture

02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:07.384
society and our state is today

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:09.520
so having said that I am glad

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:13.224
to work with stakeholders here

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:14.959
-- if there are amendments or

02:32:15.025 --> 02:32:16.093
or provisions that you think

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.761
address your needs please bring

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:19.230
them to me -- because again

02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:20.464
what I'm trying to do is not to

02:32:20.531 --> 02:32:22.533
stop recalls not to -- inhibit

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:24.101
public debate but to ensure

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:25.002
that these things are done

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:26.871
honestly and with integrity

02:32:26.937 --> 02:32:28.005
moving forward so with that

02:32:28.072 --> 02:32:29.139
Mister chair I asked when I

02:32:29.206 --> 02:32:30.407
go to that thank you senator

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:32.042
Newman center Leyva has an

02:32:32.109 --> 02:32:33.310
additional question -- point

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:34.812
to make think thank you sorry

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:36.547
about that -- when you were

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:37.748
talking about people being very

02:32:37.815 --> 02:32:39.450
forthright and honest -- with

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.952
this recall maybe all of you

02:32:42.019 --> 02:32:43.254
in here have been those of you

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:44.622
who identified herself as part

02:32:44.688 --> 02:32:46.390
of the recall I just want to

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:47.992
say that my personal experience

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:49.593
was different from that when

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:51.462
the recall first started prior

02:32:51.529 --> 02:32:55.432
to the pandemic UP I approached

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:57.535
a couple of different folks

02:32:57.601 --> 02:32:58.836
that were gathering signatures

02:32:58.903 --> 02:32:59.803
and the line that they were

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.472
using is that Gavin Newsom had

02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:03.874
raise the gas tax and I said

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:05.042
you know that's not accurate

02:33:05.109 --> 02:33:07.111
I said because I was here

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:08.812
when governor brown was the

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:10.648
one who signed that into law

02:33:10.714 --> 02:33:13.551
so I just your point senator

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:15.619
Newman people are not always

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:17.221
honest and what I said is

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:18.923
you can you can find this for

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:19.857
make sure you know why you're

02:33:19.924 --> 02:33:21.358
signing he did not raise the

02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:22.927
gas tax that was the difference

02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:25.729
governor thank you thank you

02:33:25.796 --> 02:33:28.599
I center Leyva let me let me

02:33:28.666 --> 02:33:32.236
just say -- senator Newman I

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:33.771
want to thank you for that the

02:33:33.837 --> 02:33:34.939
work that you've done with my

02:33:35.005 --> 02:33:36.140
committee staff and with me

02:33:36.206 --> 02:33:38.208
on this bill -- as you know I

02:33:38.275 --> 02:33:39.476
haven't been a big fan of this

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:40.844
guy scheme that's kind of been

02:33:40.911 --> 02:33:42.313
in line places that we have

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:43.547
today but I think what you're

02:33:43.614 --> 02:33:45.282
doing and the amendments that

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:47.151
you've taken have really gone

02:33:47.217 --> 02:33:49.153
a long way to -- dealing with

02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:50.254
a lot of the concerns that I

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:51.822
had certainly as it relates to

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:53.424
privacy and you went through

02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:54.925
a number of those -- in detail

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:56.694
so I won't repeat them -- but

02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:58.295
they're significant and I think

02:33:58.362 --> 02:33:59.663
that it gives a confidence

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:01.532
anyone signing up a petition

02:34:01.599 --> 02:34:02.566
that their name will not be

02:34:02.633 --> 02:34:06.070
abused -- as it we have similar

02:34:06.136 --> 02:34:07.972
rules in place rather --

02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:09.239
signatures that are gathered

02:34:09.306 --> 02:34:11.375
in in in a similar fashion

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:12.676
let me also mention that one

02:34:12.743 --> 02:34:14.878
of the things you didn't know

02:34:14.945 --> 02:34:16.180
was another amendment that you

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:18.682
took -- which that -- in and

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:20.818
under current law when you --

02:34:20.884 --> 02:34:22.453
advance a petition to remove

02:34:22.519 --> 02:34:24.521
someone -- that there is no

02:34:24.588 --> 02:34:26.690
highlights to -- anything that

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:27.891
you're doing on that petition

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:29.393
it simply as a paragraph it's

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.395
all jumbled together and --

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:33.430
it's very difficult for anybody

02:34:33.497 --> 02:34:34.665
being asked to sign it would

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:36.233
understand with clarity what

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:37.968
that petition really intends

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:39.603
to do and it goes to senator

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.472
-- labor's point earlier that

02:34:41.538 --> 02:34:42.773
you know what am I signing what

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:45.142
is it really do it -- the --

02:34:45.209 --> 02:34:47.478
barking from the petition as

02:34:47.544 --> 02:34:49.546
signature gather it may not be

02:34:49.613 --> 02:34:50.981
my nay not match up with what

02:34:51.048 --> 02:34:52.282
exactly they're putting before

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:53.517
that voter and you've taken an

02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:55.285
amendment to make it clear at

02:34:55.352 --> 02:34:57.821
the top of every page -- that

02:34:57.888 --> 02:34:59.556
-- the the who it is exactly

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:00.824
that person that is being

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.259
requested to be recall I think

02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:03.560
that's a significant amount

02:35:03.627 --> 02:35:05.963
as well and for those reasons

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:07.464
it's and it's for those reasons

02:35:07.531 --> 02:35:09.199
that I'm at -- going to support

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:12.036
your your bill today so we we

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:13.404
have -- we've gone through the

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.039
committee process in an orderly

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:17.274
and fair way -- here -- in the

02:35:17.341 --> 02:35:18.976
capital as we do on all bills

02:35:19.043 --> 02:35:20.544
and so we've gone through that

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:22.980
process of public testimony

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:25.115
-- extraterrestrials I want to

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:28.318
-- I want to bring a matter of

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:29.787
time I'm gonna bring the matter

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:31.422
up again back to the committee

02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:32.389
we're looking for a motion

02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:34.224
here I think senator Leyva has

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.826
asked it to be recognized at

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:37.528
this point in the proceedings

02:35:37.594 --> 02:35:39.363
-- Center Leyva you are moving

02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:40.864
this bill do passed but first

02:35:40.931 --> 02:35:42.266
re refer to the committee

02:35:42.332 --> 02:35:44.034

02:35:44.101 --> 02:35:45.369
correctly yeah so we have a

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:47.771
motion before the committee

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:49.139
and will ask the consultant

02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:54.645

02:35:58.549 --> 02:35:59.817

before the committee and

02:37:00.177 --> 02:37:01.512
what I'm presenting it would

02:37:01.578 --> 02:37:03.147
provide greater transparency

in other existing laws they are

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:20.130
unlike corporations that have

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.385
it was extremely difficult

make critical contributions

02:40:05.128 --> 02:40:06.897
in after and there's usually

out who's actually funding the

disclosure of his fund is

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:29.219
the out of in order to come

02:40:29.286 --> 02:40:30.354
to a well thought out and

02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.322
down policy The Commission

number of approaches including

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:36.326
the approach taken by the

02:40:36.393 --> 02:40:37.661
state of New York which

02:40:37.728 --> 02:40:38.562
requires an L. L.

02:40:38.628 --> 02:40:39.730

members only if the L.

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.578
L. C. reaches a threshold

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:56.580
level of physical activity that

02:40:56.646 --> 02:40:57.748
would already under current

law subject the out of the

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:00.684

center Nielsen -- for people

02:48:01.571 --> 02:48:02.639
who wonder whether this is

02:48:02.705 --> 02:48:03.973
a really a big deal this

02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:05.308
disclosure issue that this

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:07.277
bill presents I in two thousand

02:48:07.343 --> 02:48:08.311
nineteen there were two hundred

02:48:08.378 --> 02:48:11.414
and fifty three LLCs -- that --

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:12.649
were involved in our elections

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:14.250
two hundred fifty three

02:48:14.317 --> 02:48:15.285
that's that's a significant

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:16.986
amount and so all this bill

02:48:17.053 --> 02:48:18.254
is asking for is a level of

02:48:18.321 --> 02:48:19.622
transparency that equals what

02:48:19.689 --> 02:48:22.225
we require of others and --

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:23.259
I think it's something that

02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:25.228
-- will bring greater --

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:26.830

02:48:31.034 --> 02:48:35.305
