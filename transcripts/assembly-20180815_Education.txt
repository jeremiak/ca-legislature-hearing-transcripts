SO THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MY NAME IS JOHN CRYPTO I'M A FORMER -- CLASSROOM TEACHER IN GRADES FOUR EIGHT AND NINE TWELVE OF BEEN THE MADERA COUNTY TEACHER OF THE YEAR IN THE PAST. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO START A ONE TO ONE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE ALL THE KIDS GOT A MACBOOK AND THERE WERE A GOOGLE DOCS AND HIDE IT IN A PROJECT BASED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FROM DAY. ONE AND TO JUST PUT IT SUCCINCTLY A THE BEST EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH SAYS THAT TEACHERS DON'T GET BETTER. UNLESS THEY HAVE FORTY HOURS OF SUSTAINED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR. AND THE FISCAL REALITY IS THAT MOST DISTRICTS IF YOU CALL ANY OF YOUR LOCAL DISTRICTS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE ONE TO THREE DAYS OF TRAINING. PER TEACHER FOR YEAR AND THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOURS SO MOST DISTRICTS ARE ABOUT 50% OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO TRULY INCREASE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS. AND OUT ONE THING RIGHT NOW THAT'S GONNA CLASSROOMS IS THAT EVERYTHING IS IN FLUX. OF YOU'VE HEARD OF PBI ES THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH CHILDREN THE WAY THEY ARE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM WORKS A DIFFERENT. CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT ADDING DEVICES DIFFERENT TESTING IS DIFFERENT EVERYTHING'S INFLUX SO I WOULD JUST LEAVE YOU WITH ONE BIG IDEA. WE NEED A KIND OF A STATEWIDE PLAN OR OUTLINE OF WHAT BEST PRACTICES ARE FOR THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHILE WHEN THIS TRANSITION -- BECAUSE THE KIDS THAT ARE A CLASS RIGHT NOW ARE GONNA BE ARE CITIZENS OF THE FUTURE. IF WE DON'T PREPARE THEM WHILE. WE WILL NOT HAVE THE WORK FORCE WE NEED. WILL FAIL. SECOND THANK IS REMOVED AND SECOND ANY -- CONSUMMATED COMMITTEE MEMBERS SICK OF MISTER THEM.
