ARE YOU MAY COME UP SIR SENATOR- CONTAMINATED SITE CLEANUP AND SAFETY ACT THIS BILL DEALS WITH CONTAMINATED SITES AS WELL AS WITH SEQUEL. OVER HERE IN VOTE ON THE WHOLE BILL OUR COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION IS ON THE CONTAMINATED SITE PORTION. THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFER TO ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE WHICH DEALS WITH THE SEQUEL ISSUE. SO WHAT WILL BE ASKING THAT I'LL MENTION THIS AGAIN AS WE FINISH USED TO VOTE ON THE- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CONTAMINATED SITES RATHER THAN ON SEEK WELL BECAUSE THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DEAL WITH THE SEQUEL ISSUE AND THAT WILL BE DEALT WITH AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. OKAY SENATOR- DOMINIC CORTESE WAS YOUR FATHER YES THEREFORE IT IS REFERRED APPROPRIATE THAT YOU HAVE A BILL UPDATING HIS LAST PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY PLEASED TO SEE YOU TO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH GREAT TO BE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM TODAY A PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THIRTY SEVEN. A BILL THE SAFEGUARDS PUBLIC HELP BY PROHIBITING THE USE OF WHAT'S CALLED A COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS LOCATED ON CORTESE LIST SITES CORTESE LIST ORIGINALLY- AS YOU JUST POINTED OUT MISTER CHAIR CREATED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES- BY MY FATHER FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN DOMINIC CORTESE IS A LIST OF CONTAMINATED SITES CREATED BY VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPILING INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RELEASE SITES. STATE LAW CURRENTLY PROHIBITS CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM BEING GRANTED A PROJECTS IMPACTING SITES LISTED ON THE CORTESE LIST BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION ON THE SITE POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REVISITED. OF IN OVER A DECADE AS A RESULT SOME LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE SKIRTED THE LAW. BY GRANTING EXEMPTIONS PURSUANT TO THE SO CALLED COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION ALLOWING PROJECTS TO BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. PURSUING THOSE PROJECTS WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND APPROPRIATE CLEANUP POSES SEVERE HEALTH RISKS TO LABOUR'S WORKING ON THE SITE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT LIVE NEAR THE SITE. AND FUTURE TENANTS OF THE PROPERTY. SB THIRTY SEVEN CLARIFIES THE LAW TO CONFORM CONFIRM- THAT THIS COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION CANNOT BE GRANTED FOR PROJECTS ON THE CORTESE LIST SITES. RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP- BY OPPOSITION THAT PROHIBITING THE USE OF THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION WOULD IMPLICATE PROJECTS IMPACTING SITES THAT HAVE RECEIVED A NO FURTHER ACTION LETTER INNER DEEMED CLOSED. WE ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION ENSURING THAT.A SITES POSITION ON THE LIST ITSELF DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN ALL CASES PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE'S NO FURTHER ACTION LETTER. APPOINT ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD REQUIRE SEEK REVIEW OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL IN HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS JAMES THEIR WACHTER FROM THE STATE COUNCIL BELIEVERS IN CHELSEA TWO FROM THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM- I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SO LET CENTER FROM MODERATOR CAN'T DO WE HAVE JAMES THURBER WACKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF LAB LABORS ON THE LINE IF SO PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CARE- CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH MISTER CHAIR. YES I'M GOING TO TURN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS JAMES DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA-STATE COUNCIL LABORS. WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF SB THIRTY SEVEN. AND WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR CORTESE'S LEADERSHIP AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT ON THIS BILL. LABORS ARE COMPRISED OF OVER SIXTY THOUSAND UNION UNION WORKERS STATEWIDE AND WE ARE IN TERMS OF- MEMBERSHIP THE LARGEST CONSTRUCTION UNION IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER IT'S REPAIRING OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. OR IMPLEMENTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MULTI FAMILY AND MIXED USE PROJECTS. THE SAFETY OF BOTH OUR WORKERS MISTER ANY COMMUNITIES OF OUR JOB SITES REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY ONE THAT WE DO NOT WISH TO COMPROMISE. SB THIRTY SEVEN CLOSES A LOOPHOLE IN THE SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS THAT OTHERWISE COULD PLACE TO HELP AT RISK OF STATE WORKERS. YOUR WORKERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS- TERRORIST. UNDER CURRENT LAW TO SEEK WORK PROHIBITS CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PROPERTIES ON A STATE WIDE ROSTER OF HAZARDOUS WASTE THAT CALL THE CORTESE. THESE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE ONLY SUPPOSED TO GO TO PROJECTS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT OR TO HUMAN HEALTH- THE PROHIBITION IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND FUTURE OCCUPANTS FROM EXPOSURE TO DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES. ET COMMONSENSE EXACTING HOWEVER WHICH THE SENATOR ALLUDED TO- IS ANOTHER BLACK WITH BETTER TERM LOOPHOLE THAT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RECENT YEARS. THESE TYPE OF EXEMPTIONS ENCOURAGE- FAST TRACK PROJECT APPROVAL AND ALLOW CITIES TO WHAT STATE REVIEW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO APPLY ONLY TO THOSE PROJECTS REPRESENT NO POSSIBILITY. OF SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS. IF YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY BY HE CAN REVIEW. IT WITH THIS MECHANISM. THE FOURTEENTH REPAIRS AND SOME OF THE MOST THREATENING HAZARDS ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE ARE THOSE THAT WORKERS CANNOT BE READILY FEEL. HE HAD A DROP IN THE RESULT OF CONTAMINATED SOIL AND GROUNDWATER LEAKING UNDERGROUND TANKS OR THE IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF WASTE MATERIALS AMONG OTHER CAUSES. THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE TO PROVIDE ALL EXEMPTION INCLUDING THESE COMMON SENSE PROTECTIONS. CANNOT BE GRANTED TO PROJECTS THAT ARE NAMED ON THE PARTICULAR. IF I COULD BRIEFLY ADD THAT WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE HOUSING CRISIS IN PARADIP TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT STARTED UNDERGOING COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS YOUR GUIDE YOUR TIME IS UP YOU'VE HAD YOUR TWO MINUTES UNLESS YOU WANT TO EAT INTO CHELSEA TO THIS TIME. NO I RECOGNIZE BE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR TALKING SURE. OKAY NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM CHELSEA TO ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRE ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT PLEASE PROCEED AND WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CHOCOLATIER AND I'M WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT THIRTY YEARS EUROPEANS WORKED WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TAP THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND STATE CAN SHORT THAT BOEHNER WANTS ME NEEDS CAN PROVIDE. A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. WE'VE THAT HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT STARTS WITH THE STATE AND HEALTHY HOME BUYERS FREE FROM HAZARDS AND THAT IS WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB THIRTY SEVEN. THIS BILL COLD LOCAL AGENCIES TO THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE ANYTHING NECESSARY TO PREVENT FURTHER USE OF THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION AND OTHER EXPANSION BY LOCAL AGENCY. I THINK NOW PEOPLE REQUIRED PROJECT PROPONENTS TO ANALYZE PUBLICLY DISCLOSE AND MITIGATE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT I THINK THE PROCESS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCATING SENSELESS MUSIC BACK HOME. ON LAND THAT'S CONTAMINATED WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HOWEVER ESCAPING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AGENCIES HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE PUBLIC AND FUTURE REFERENCE RIGHT TO LEARN ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND HELP MAKE IT SHOULD DEVELOP. YOU HAVE TOXIC LAND. HI HAS ALSO TAKEN AWAY THE PUB ABILITY TO. THAT MAXIM CLEAN UP LEAST ADEQUATE UP DONE TO. A PROJECT IS APPROVED. SOME PROJECT PROPONENTS NEED A CHECKS AND BALANCES BUILT INTO C. CLASS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DO NOT CALL IN THE FIRST PEOPLE HEALTH IMPACTS TO THE FAMILIES TO- LET. ME ABOUT MINUTES FOR DECADES. THANKS CENTER COUNTRY THE FOR BRINGING THE SPELL AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DIRECTOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE HAVE A WITNESS YEAR IN PERSON WHO WILL GIVE HIS NAME.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOHN KENNEDY I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB THIRTY SEVEN WE FEEL SB THIRTY SEVEN IS AN OVERLY BROAD BILL AND WILL UNNECESSARILY INCREASE COST AND THE WAY APPROVAL FOR MANY TYPES OF MINOR PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL. AT THOUSANDS OF STATE AND LOCAL FACILITIES SB THIRTY SEVEN PROHIBITS THE USE THAT SYNC WITH COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN ON ANY OF THE ROUGHLY FORTY THREE THOUSAND FORTY DELASALLE RIGHT ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND WHICH INVOLVES LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REMEDIATED. THOUSANDS OF STATE AND LOCAL FACILITIES ARE ON THE COURT TO DELIST INCLUDING LOCAL AIRPORTS FIRE STATIONS POLICE DEPARTMENTS CORPORATION YARDS AND MANY C. H. P. CALTRANS CAL FIRE AND STATE PARKS FACILITIES. COMMENT EXEMPTION SB THIRTY SEVEN RESTRICTS CAN ONLY BE USED WHERE IT'S CLEAR THAT A PRODUCT WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT THE FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES EQUAL A PRODUCT ISN'T SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT AND WHAT THAT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS ISN'T BY TAPPING SEQUENCE THESE PROJECTS SIMPLY AND APPROPRIATELY AREN'T SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS FOR WHICH THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS TYPICALLY USED AND WOULD BE IMPACTED BY SB THIRTY SEVEN. INCLUDE EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED USE PERIMETER SIDE OF GREUBEL CONTINUATION OF AN EXISTING LEASE REPLACEMENT OF AN EXISTING ROOF INSTALLATION OF SECURITY EQUIPMENT OR FENCING. MAINTENANCE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING STRUCTURES ARE IN TURKEY ALTERATIONS AND EVEN PAVING AND PARKING LOT REPAIRS. SO STRICTLY CONSTRUED SB THIRTY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMPLY WITH THE QUOTE PERFORMING INITIAL STUDY PROVIDE NOTICES AND ISSUE A NEGATIVE DECLARATION. ASSEMBLY REPAIRING OR REPLACING THE ROOF AT A LOCAL FIRE STATION OR PARENTS SECURITY FENCING IT MAN MANY MUNICIPAL AIRPORTS. AFTER TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HEARING THE TESTIMONY TODAY WE DON'T THINK THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THEY INTEND TO FALL UNDER SB THIRTY SEVENS REACH. WE OPPOSE THAT THE THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT'S OVERLY BROAD IT WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS IN PROPHECIES ON LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS FOR NO ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. AT MANY STATE AND LOCAL FACILITIES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BUT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. SB THIRTY SEVEN TODAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK VERY MUCH.

WE HAVE OFFERED A VERY TARGETED REASONABLE SET OF AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE THE BILL AND ALLOW IT TO ACHIEVE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITHOUT UNDERMINING HOUSING PRODUCTION UNTIL SITES NEAR JOBS AND TRANSIT. ECKLEY IMPORTANT AS WE SIX DIRECT DEVELOPMENT AWAY FROM HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IT IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STANDARD WHEN EVALUATING BROWNFIELD SITES. OUR TARGET AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED OUR MODERN HOPE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THOSE WOULD ALLOW COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION TO BE USED ONLY ONE.

THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S LIKE THAT FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMILAR. ANYONE ELSE MISTER VICE CHAIR. WELL JUST I KNOW IT'S NOT PART OF OUR PREVIEW BUT MY CONCERNS I WANT TO BE ON THE RECORD IS WITH THE AMENDMENTS IF YOU CAN WORK THROUGH THE THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR RETIRED IT'S GOING TO HAVE A WELL HI BIRDS SOME COST FOR ANY PROJECT BIG SPECIALLY WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH ON THE LIST IT BEEN REMEDIATED BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SEQUEL SELECT A BIG CONCERN. I THINK IT'S ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WE'RE VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WE WANT TO GO THAT BUT I THINK IT'S STALLED THE PROJECT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA SO FAR LOOK FOR TO BE A MEMBER TO COME ABOARD. VERY GOOD ANYONE ELSE. JOHN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY. I'LL ALSO BE- OPPOSING TODAY JUST SEE WHERE THE AMENDMENTS GO THERE'S A HUNDRED- PROJECTS IN MY DISTRICT BOTH STATE AND LOCAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THIS WILL AFFECT SO- I'M INTERESTED TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE ARM SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- AS I NDICATED A RELEASE ALLUDED TO IN- IN MY PRESENTATION- WE DO UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND AS A FORMER SERVICE STATION OWNER OPERATOR WHO DEALT WITH THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK LAWS- IN MY FAMILY CONTINUES TO THIS DAY- IRONICALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT WAS MY FATHER'S LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE REQUIREMENT THE FIRST PLACE SO. INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE ISSUES IN THE STEPS AND WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FRUSTRATION OUT THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH CLOSE SITES THAT OUR LEGACY SITES ON THE LIST AND WHETHER OR NOT AS WE GET TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE THAT'LL BE THE ISSUE I THINK WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER SEEK WAY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT ITSELF THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT AS OF YESTERDAY PERFECT- IN PART DEALING WITH- THE ACTUAL PLAN DEPARTMENT IN MY HOME CITY SAN JOSE- WHERE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE RUN ACROSS- THOUSANDS OF THESE CASES OVER TIME- THAT I THINK WE HAVE AN ELEGANT SOLUTION IN THE FORM OF AMENDMENTS THAT WILL- BASICALLY NOT SAY THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS IN PLAY BECAUSE THAT WOULD SAY THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD EITHER EITHER FROM. A RESIDUAL FROM THE CLOSE SITE OR FROM THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT ITSELF- THAT THIS IS NOT A FAIR STATEMENT THAT THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. SHORT CUT TO SORT OF GET IT OFF THE LIST WHAT WE'D MUCH RATHER DO IS HAVE AN EXEMPTION THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE CLOSE SITE- THAT THAT NO LONGER WITH A NO FURTHER ACTION LETTER NO LONGER AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER SEQUEL- AND THEN YOU'RE AND THEN YOUR PROJECT GOES THROUGH YOUR LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS LIKE IT NORMALLY WOULD MAYBE AS INITIAL STUDY MAYBE HAS A FULL LIKE THE I. R. IF IT'S BIG ENOUGH PROJECT- MAYBE IT HAS NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW ROOF ON THE BUILDING- BUT- BUT THAT IT WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY- FALL UNDER. YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE LEVELS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW JUST BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LIST WITH A NO FURTHER ACTION BETTER SO WE THINK WITH ON FRIDAY WITH A COUPLE SENTENCES THAT CAN BE CLEANED UP- RATHER NICELY AND- I JUST WANTED TO ASSURE YOU KNOW THOSE WHO MADE THE INQUIRY AND MADE THEIR STATEMENTS ON THE RECORD THAT. WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL SEE THE BILL AGAIN I GUESS EVERYONE WILL EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD SEE YOU SHOULD SEE THAT SOLUTION THERE SO THANK YOU AND AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS- THANK YOU SENATOR. I'M GLAD YOU ARE. THINKING AHEAD- GIVEN THAT THE THIS CONSOLIDATED LIST WAS CREATED A COUPLE DECADES AGO WITH. ONE OTHER- SOLUTION TO THIS SO WE DON'T HAVE- HOLD UP NECESSARY HOUSING WHICH WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE OF WOULD BE A MECHANISM FOR THE STATE AGENCIES REMOVE SITES FROM THE LIST. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S FEASIBLE OR NOT- BUT MY STAFF IS WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND- ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE IF THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. SO PLEASE- TALK TALK TO MY STAFF AND SEE WHAT WHAT CAN BE DONE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- SO RIGHT NOW- I WOULD. I'D LIKE TO RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE- WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

SMITH NO ARAMBULA ARAMBULA HI OUR QUE HAN DALLI DALLI NO CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI HOLDEN HOLDEN HI MATHIS. WHAT A TO G. SO WE NEED TO HOLD IT OPEN YES ORDER SO WE HAVE FOUR VOTES WE NEED FIVE- THIRTY THREE MEMBERS WHO WERE DELAYED SO- JUST KEEP AN EYE ON IT UNDERSTANDABLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. OKAY NEXT- WE HAVE SENATOR DODD- MY COLLEAGUES WHO IS WITH US IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR COUPLE OF YEARS- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IN MEMBERS- S. B. TWO TWO TWO WOULD ESTABLISH THE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH DRINKING AND WASTEWATER SERVICES TO LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. AS SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I AUTHORED LEGISLATION AB FOUR OH ONE ASKING THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF LOW INCOME GROUP WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR WHAT WE CALL LIRA. THE BOARD'S DONE THAT IN SB TWO TWO TWO TAKES THE NEXT STEP OF MOVING FORWARD TO ENACT SUCH A PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO COMPLETING THE WATER LIVER STUDY THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RECENTLY SURVEYED HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AROUND THE STATE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WATER DEBT WATER SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS WERE CREWING. THIS IS A SURVEY RESULTS WERE VERY SOBERING HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM OF WATER UNAFFORDABILITY HAS BECOME. OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THE WATER UTILITY BILLS THAT'S OVER FIVE MILLION PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER. 12% OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS HAVE A DEBT OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEBTS GREATER THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS CUMULATIVELY CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCRUED ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A WATER DEBT AND THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING AROUND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PRE PANDEMIC OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAD ALREADY LOST WATER SERVICE DUE TO AN INABILITY TO PAY WATER BILLS. THAT NUMBER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. GROWING WATER THAT IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR WATER SYSTEMS SOME WATER SYSTEMS OF LOSS AS MUCH AS 30% OF THE REVENUE. AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED THIRTY COMMUNITIES SMALL WATER SYSTEMS ARE FACING FINANCIAL COLLAPSE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. CALIFORNIA HAVE LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. NOT WITHSTANDING STATE POLICY THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THERE'S NO COMPARABLE WATER RATES SYSTEMS PROGRAM FOR PUBLICLY OWNED AND COMMUNITY OWNED WATER SYSTEMS. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE A STATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR THEIR DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. SB TWO TWO IS A NARROW IS REALLY NARROWED ITS FOCUS ON DIRECT WATER RESISTANCE WATER CRISIS ASSISTANCE IN RIGHT CREDIT. THE BILL REQUIRES THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP AN EXPENDITURE PLAN. THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE FUNDING NEEDS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WELL I'M GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR DO SOME FOR PROPOSING ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF WATER WITH DEBT RELIEF. THE TRUTH THERE'S THE PROBLEM WATER ON AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS WILL PERSIST. THIS BILL IS NOT ADEPT AT IDENTIFYING A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE RAID SYSTEMS PROGRAM. THAT IS A PARALLEL CONVERSATION. IS BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT VOTE ON THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT MOVED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARAMBULA DR ARAMBULA THANK YOU- WE NOW HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TESTIFYING ON THE PHONE LINE. ARM SO JENNIFER CLAY ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION- PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY CARE COURT AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER CLARY AND I'M THAT CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION OUR ORGANIZATION IS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND I AM ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. OUR ORGANIZATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS SENATE BILL TWO TWENTY TWO WHICH WOULD FINALLY PUT INTO PLACE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE LOW INCOME WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OUR YEARS ADVOCATING FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER TAUGHT AT THAT MAKING WATER STATE IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE IF THE HOUSEHOLD OUR COMMUNITY CAN'T AFFORD THE WATER FROM THEIR TAPS THAT WATER IS STILL NOT ACCEPTABLE. THE WATERGATE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE PANDEMIC ALSO HIGHLIGHTED A LONG STANDING PROBLEM AND THAT DEVELOPED FOR OTHER UTILITIES ARE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT FOR THOSE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IS CHAIRED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THAT OFFERS A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY ENROLLMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ABYSMAL LARGELY BECAUSE UP TO EIGHTEEN REQUIREMENTS THE RESULT IS THAT FEW ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. ACTUALLY RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. EXCEPTION ISN'T ON UTILITY. WHICH HAVE HIRING ROLE THAT IN THE WATER LINE PROGRAM. THREE REASONS. ONE THERE MAY. BY THE CAL PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SURE THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO PROPOSITION CHIU EIGHTEEN INSTRUCTION AND THREE THEY ALSO REGULARLY SHARE ELIGIBILITY DATA WITH INVESTOR OWNED ENERGY UTILITIES IS LONGSTANDING AFFORDABILITY PROGRAMS. AND ROLL MORE THAN AFFORDABILITY IS AN ISSUE IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE SMALL WORLD COMMUNITIES SUBURBS AND URBAN CENTERS STATE ACTION IS NEEDED TO PURCHASE AFFORDABILITY GAP IN SB TWENTY TO CREATE POSSIBLE INTEREST TAX FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. EXCELLENT THANK YOU. ON NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM. LAUREN A KIßM ON BEHALF OF THE L. A. ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY ON THE PHONE LINE PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CARE CORKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LONNIE CAMERON THE WATER CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY A NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE. OUR ORGANIZATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL GIVEN OUR WORK AT W. P. AS WELL AS I RESEARCH ON WATER ACCESS AND HUNDREDS OF WATER SYSTEM THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. YOU ARE WORK WE KNOW MILLIONS OF L. A. COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE COST OF THEIR UTILITIES. UCLA STUDY ESTIMATES WANTED THREE ANGELENOS HAVE WATER AND POWER THAT AND THAT THIS IS UNDULY BORNE BY LATIN ACTION BLACKS BLACK HOUSEHOLDS. AND SOMEONE COME TO REDUCE OF COLORS THIS NUMBER JUMPS TO MORE THAN HALF OF RESIDENTS WHO ARE AND THAT. AND VERY CHARITY SPEND OVER HALF A BILLION LED TO BE P. ACCOUNTS ARE CURRENTLY AND THAT WHICH IS TOTAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I TO REPOWER ELLIE COALITION TOWN HALL LAST WEEK RESIDENTS SPOKE MOVINGLY ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLE TO BE ABLE TO COVER ALL OF THEIR BILLS INCLUDING UTILITIES. AND HITTING BACK AGAINST MEDICAL EXPENSES AND SUIT. AND LADWP CUSTOMERS ARE RELATIVELY MORE FORTUNATE AND SO FAR IT'S PROBABLY DUE TO BE P. HAS LOW INCOME PROGRAMS THAT WERE GRANDFATHERED IN. BUT PROP TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX HAD PUT SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON. THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THIS PROGRAM. IN OTHER. OF THE- WE KNOW FROM. ORG THAT THOUSAND OF PEOPLE OUR CUSTOMER THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS YOU DO NOT HAVE REPAIR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OF ANY KIND AND THAT THE ARE OFTEN PAYING EXTREMELY HIGH RATES FOR WATER AS WELL SPACING WATER QUALITY ISSUES. THAT EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE LIKE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS RESIDENTS WATER THAT. WE NEED SB TO HELP CONFRONT THIS ISSUE AND ARE GRATEFUL TO ALLAH IF YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR DODD AND THE BILL'S CO AUTHORS AND SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. EXCELLENT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I SEE NO ONE- NEXT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESS- CINDY TALK ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES- PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK IN MEMBERS CINDY TALK WITH AQUA WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB TWO TWO TWO WE AGREE WITH SENATOR DODD THAT ANY WATER LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS THAT SENATOR DODD HAS MADE TO DATE. WE DO THINK THE BILL NEEDS MORE WORK OUR LETTER CAPTURES FIVE ISSUES AND ALL NOT TO OPPOSE THIS MORNING THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE FIRST IS- AS BACKGROUND THE BILL WOULD APPROPRIATELY HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. BUT THE PART OF THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE ADOPTION OF THE FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THE PROGRAM. PROPOSES TO HAVE BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. IN THE STATE WATER BOARD APPROVES DEATH FUND EXPENDITURE PLANS. SO WE SUGGEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSULT WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD ON THE PLAN BUT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE FUND EXPENDITURES PLANNED SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE AGENCY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT- SO THAT WOULD BE A SIMPLE CHANGE IN SECTION ONE ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT ONE SUBDIVISION A- THE SECOND ISSUE- RELATES TO A PROPOSAL IN THE BILL FOR A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IN THE DEVELOPMENT BY THREE AGENCIES OF METRICS FOR THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT- WE THINK THAT A GOOD LOW INCOME WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CAN BE VERY EFFICIENT STILL INSIDE INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A COMPLICATED NEEDS ASSESSMENT LIKE THERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT FOR SB TWO HUNDRED THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PROGRAM WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT. IN THIS CASE- THAT DEPARTMENT OR THE BILL CAN SET A FLAT RATE BENEFIT FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD COME UP BENEFIT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA BETTER IN THAT'S HOW MANY ARE LOW INCOME HELP. SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING. PROGRAM DOLLARS ON ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR NEEDS ASSESSMENT WE SUGGEST JUST YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT FLAT RATE IS IN USE THE MONEY FOR THE BENEFT IN OTHER WORDS THE SUBSIDY. THAT WILL HELP THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES- BEFORE THEIR WATER BILL. SO WE IN YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE IS WE THINK THERE CAN BE A GOOD PROGRAM HERE AND WE THINK IT SHOULD BE EFFICIENT. SO THAT- THAT CHANGE WOULD BE DELETING SUBDIVISIONS FEE OF PROPOSED SECTION. ONE ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT ONE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TURNING AND THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES THIS MORNING THANK YOU. WELL NOW IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION WHO'S IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM SAYING NO ONE. ARE WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

I'M LET'S SEE WE'RE FINISHED WITH TESTIMONY AND WE THEREFORE WILL GO TO MEMBERS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALL. HI I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF YOUR BILL- I JUST WANTED TO- AND I APOLOGIZE I GO HOME- FOR COMING IN LATE TO AYE WELL AND IF YOU COVERED THIS ALREADY BUT- I'M I'M LOOKING AT- OFC WAS. OPPOSITION LETTER AND- THEY'RE ASKING THE QUESTION ABOUT- THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND- AND IN THEIR REQUEST THE CENTRE DIED- CLARIFY THAT IS NOT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO FUND THE PROGRAM WITH THE WATER TAX. COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YEP THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OBVIOUSLY IT'S STATE LAW YOUR BY BALLOT INITIATIVE IS LIMITED IN THE ABILITY TO- YOU KNOW TO DO THAT SO- NO THERE'S BEEN NOTHING IN THIS WHAT WE HOPE- YEAH WE'VE GOT. I MEAN IT AS EVIDENCED BY THIS YEAR WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET A BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO BUDGET FOR THIS TYPE OF SITUATION BUT CLEARLY BEFORE. THE PANDEMIC WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN THIS AREA SO- I DID NOT. ASK FOR A- THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE A BUDGET AUGMENTATION TO IT AT ALL IT'S NOT ATTACHED WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET THE FRAMEWORK. FOR THIS PROGRAM SO IT'S READY TO GO FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE ALREADY HAD THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE IT A LOT EASIER TO GET MONEY OUT. TO PEOPLE WITH THIS BILLION DOLLARS AT IT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING NOW. AND I RESPECT THAT- YEAH OFF WAS- YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE WITH STAFF WE WORK WITH THEM AND HAD A LOT OF- YOUR MEMBERS BUT NOTE NOTE NO WATER TAX. THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR BRINGING US FOR THAT BUT THE DISCLAIMER AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. TWO AGO OVER THERE. BUT MY BIG CONCERN IS EVEN WITH THE- LETTERS OF OPPOSITION. BUT EVEN SOME OF THE LETTERS OF SUPPORT. STATE ASKING FOR THE AMENDMENT. SO BUT LIKE TO SEE THAT LANGUAGE GO FORWARD. BEFORE I DO SUPPORT IT. AND AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE HAS TO BE FOUND. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. LOOK LIKE YOU JUST SAID THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. AND THAT IS A COST BUT- BUT MIGHT MIGHT FIGHT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE I GOT HERE IS WATER STORAGE WE TOOK THE GOVERNOR TOOK A BILLION DOLLARS. AND HAD WATER STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE WATER SOURCE. IN THE LOWER COST OF WATER SO I LOOK FORWARD TO MAYBE YOU CAN WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR. THE THRONE OF THE BILLION B. AND WE HAVE LOTS OF BILLIONS AROUND RIGHT NOW FOR WATER STORAGE. YES PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR- CENTER DODD IT'S GREAT TO CO AUTHOR OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WITH YOU AND I CANNOT EXPRESS THE IMPORTANCE. OF GETTING THIS RIGHT OF ENSURING. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE WATER TO SO MANY THAT NEED IT- MANY OF YOU ALL KNOW MY DISTRICT MY HOME TOWN OF PORTERVILLE. IS SADLY HISTORICALLY GLOBALLY KNOWN AS THE CITY WITHOUT WATER- THEN WE STILL ARE FACING THESE CHALLENGES. BUT I ALSO MUST GAS IS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR YOU DO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT HAD COME UP AS THIS IS MOVED TO THE PROCESS THAT DO DROUGHT CONCERNS- AND I KNOW I HAVEN'T. TALKED TO YOU PREVIOUSLY ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY AS THINGS MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN THE EVAN FLOW SOMETIMES THESE BILLS MOVE OVER- FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE RATHER QUICKLY AND RAPIDLY. IN DUE TO THE COVERED RESTRICTIONS WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO BE FACE TO FACE BECAUSE WE JUST OPENED THIS WEEK- BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU MOVING FORWARD I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY- BUT IT. BUT AS A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE WHO DOES CARE ABOUT THIS- WE HAVE TO GET THIS ONE RIGHT. UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SOLID FUNDING FORMULA. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE MASSIVE BUDGET INCREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN- WHEN WE WERE EXPECTING A RECESSION TO SEE A- HUGE SURPLUS. WE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THIS FUNDING SITUATION IS SET IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU FURTHER ON THIS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I'M LET ME JUST ADDRESS THE FUNDING ISSUE- UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AS THE SENATOR HAS SAID WE CAN'T HAVE- A- QUILLEN OF THE CARE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE FOR UTILITIES FOR. BECAUSE UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN EVERYBODY PAYS THEIR OWN WAY THERE'S NO WAY TO SET UP PROGRAM THE OTHER QUESTION IS AND THIS IS WHAT ART WAS WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT WE COULD PRODUCE A TAX. I'M PUTTING IN THE BILL- THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF TAX- IS NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE A PRE AT THE NEXT- LEGISLATURE COULD OVERRULE IT THIS IS A AN AMENDMENT THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR WHICH SIMPLY. WOULD BE USELESS ARE THE NEXT LEGISLATOR LEGISLATION- DOES SIMPLY OVERLY SO- I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING THE OTHER THING IS TO GET ANY KIND OF TAX INCLUDING THE KIND OF TAX THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT- IT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER VOTE SO AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THERE IS NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT FIRST OBJECTION. ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE. OKAY OF THE SENATOR PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU COULD TALK ABOUT. THE OTHER TWO AMENDMENTS ONE IS TO HAVE A SIMPLER- FUND A SIMPLER- DETERMINATION OF HOW THE FUNDING IS. SPENT AND THE OTHER IS- THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE- CARE PROGRAM WHICH I DO NOT. WHAT ARE YOU ADDRESS THOSE TWO HOURS ARE SEVEN STRUCTURE SURE. SO YEAH THE FIRST ONE IS THE FIRST ONE OKAY IN THE SECOND ONE THAT THEY BRING UP. IS THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT CARE PROGRAM IS- PROPERLY SET UP. SO THAT THEY THINK THAT ARE ON CARE SHE BE ON THE IS A SAN WHAT THE SAYING WELL IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT NOW THAT'S ALSO I CAN I PER THE CHAIR AT THE YOU MEMBERS FOR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS YOU ALL THE SIMPLE DETERMINATION I BOUGHT REAL WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT SOME SIMPLY DOES OKAY AND WE AND I HEARD- THIS TALK BRING UP THEY WHAT WE JUST SPREAD THE SOUL ALL OVER EVERYBODY AN- AND MAKE IT EASIER. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE OF DOING IT THE WAY IT'S SET UP IN THE BILL BECAUSE WE MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE STANDARD IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW WHAT 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVELOR YOU KNOW EVEN GO HIGHER LOOK IT'S- BECAUSE A BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE MAY NOT BE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY AND SO- TAKING CARE OF NOBODY IS NOT AN ANSWER AND SO WE GOT TO DO WHAT WE CAN DO SO I WILL I WILL LOOK AT THAT AND WE WILL- YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY OF BEEN DEBILITATING THAT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SLIDING SCALE OR MODIFY IT IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT COMING BACK TO A LEGISLATURE RUNNING ANOTHER BILL CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT. ABOUT THE CARE PROGRAM IF THE CARE PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK THEN WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT DOESN'T WORK AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE IT RIGHT SO- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT PER SHEET THE QUESTIONS OKAY SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL ARE PROVIDING- AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE FOR DRINKING WATER AND WATER SERVICES. IN THE SAME MANNER WE DO FOR ENERGY SERVICES. IS SOMETHING I STRONGLY SUPPORT. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A COP. PROGRAM THAT. THE SENATOR IS CREATING. AND THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS- PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I OR MY COMMITTEE STAFF YOU CAN HELP. I THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THE SENATOR BROUGHT UP. AND I REQUEST THAT COMMITTEE TO TAKE THIS BILL AND VOTE ON HIGH. ALL RIGHT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS S. B.

FOUR OH THREE I THINK WE'RE READY WE'RE ALL DONE ALL RIGHT NOW GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIRED THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR- THE WONDERFUL ANALYSIS AHEAD OF PRINCE TODAY TO PRESENT SB FOUR ZERO THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE STATE WATER AUTHORITIES. WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP CALIFORNIA FINALLY REALIZED THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FIX SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH PROVIDE OF THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER MANDATORY CONSOLIDATIONS. FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER WELL THIS AUTHORITY IS IMPORTANT IN THE STATE'S SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY PROVIDING UNSAFE WATER WE NEED PREVENTATIVE AND PROACTIVE MEASURES NOW SB FOUR ZERO THREE PROVIDES A PROACTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BY EXPANDING UPON SB EIGHTY EIGHT CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY TO APPLY TO WATER SYSTEMS WITH LESS THAN THIRTY THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS. THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ARE AT RISK OF FAILING. CONSOLIDATION IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL AND APPROVING ACCESS TO SAFE WATER BECAUSE A LARGER CONSOLIDATED SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY MORE RELIABLE SAFE AND EFFICIENT. MEMBERS THE WATER BOARD'S RECENTLY REACHED RELEASED TWENTY TWENTY ONE DRINKING WATER NEEDS OVER ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED OVER SIX HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILING AND DETERMINE THAT ONE THIRD OF THOSE. ASSESSED DOMESTIC WELLS ARE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND WELLS WERE CLASSIFIED AS HIGH RISK. THIS IS WHY WE MUST ASK ASK ACT NOW IT'S GIVE ME. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE BLANCA ESQUIVEL POLICY ADVOCATE FOR LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ABLE CREWS FOR A RESIDENTS OF TO LOUISVILLE CALIFORNIA- WHO WILL BE IN A TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

WONDERFUL COMMUNITY ARE ONE. AWAY FROM HAVING ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE HOME. WAITING ON EMERGENCY TO OCCUR IF YOU TAKE ACTION IS INEFFICIENT BELIEVES MANY FAMILY THAT. TAKING ACTION NOW ELIMINATES TRUST AND FAMILIES THE STRAIN ON STATE RESOURCES THE PATENT TO PROVIDE COFFEE BOTTLED WATER. AND INSTALL WATER TANKS IF WE WANT ANYTHING DURING THE FUNDAMENTALS THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ENSURE COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. SB FOUR THREE BILLS ON SPD EIGHT BY ALLOWING CONSOLIDATIONS QUESTION TO BEGIN LED BY COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR EMERGENCY TO HAPPEN. IF PASSED THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WILL HAVE A TOOL TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS AND FACILITATE CONSOLIDATION IF IT'S A VIABLE OPTION FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE RIGHT BY NOT RISK WATER SYSTEM OR DOMESTIC WELL. AND THE COMMUNITIES WHICH TO PURSUE THIS OPTION THIS BILL IS ALSO INCLUDES A THOROUGH PUBLIC PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES ENGAGED IN THE CONCERNS AND PRIORITIES ARE KICKING INTO ACCOUNT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER TODAY AND WOULD BENEFIT YOU MENTALLY TREMENDOUSLY FROM THIS BILL. THAT'S BEEN BUILT ON CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP BY ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. RESPECTFULLY. URGE YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. WELL NOW HERE FROM. A BELL CREW RESIDENT OF TO LEAVE- PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. HI MY NAME IS STABLE CRUZ I AM FROM ILLEGAL SENATE BILL WATER HAS BEEN HIGH LEVEL OF THANKS BYE HOLDEN PROGRAM.

MORNING AND THANK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS- CSTA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB PORT THREE UNLESS IT'S AMENDED AND THEN LET ME START OF BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF OF THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR- INSISTENT WILLINGNESS TO DIALOGUE AND DISCUSS THESE ISSUES WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP. AND HEAR US OUT- WELL WE APPLAUD THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE AND OF COURSE SHARE THE- UNIVERSAL OF LIABLE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR EVERYONE- THE BILL HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESS. OUR MEMBERS SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH ELECTED BOARDS PLEASE DISTRICTS ARE CREATED BY THE VOTER AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE BOAT. THERE LIKE TO BOARD MEMBERS LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY DRINK THE SAME WATER AND PAY THE SAME RATES AS THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND CERTAINLY WANT SAY FLYABLE FORTY DRINKING WATER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT GETS BROWN ACTOR. PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. TRANSPARENCY RATEPAYER PROTECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY AS PEOPLE ARE THREE TREATS NEWS LOCAL ELECTED AGENCIES IS THE SAME AS A PRIVATE SYSTEM ARE FOR PROFITS IS. BOB VASSALLO OF THE ADDRESS WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT SPECIAL DISTRICT PUBLIC AGENCIES- AND ACCORDING TO THE STATE WATER BOARDS RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT SPECIAL DISTRICTS REPRESENT OUR THIRTY NINE OUT OF THE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN NAMES ADDRESS SYSTEMS. IN OUR MEMBERS EXPERIENCE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE OFTEN USING STUDENTS HOPING TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ABOUT NEIGHBORING SYSTEM. AND WITH APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OUR MEMBERS ARE READY TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AND BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION. HOWEVER WHAT WE OPPOSE IS INCREASINGTHE AUTHORITY- AND I'M ELECTED STATE BOARD TO OVER RULE- LOCAL ACTION. DULY ELECTED BOARD AND POTENTIALLY EVEN GIVE I COMMUNITIES PUBLICLY OWNED ASSETS TO A PRIVATE ENTITY AND THERE'S NO RECOURSE FOR THE BUILDER WHO CREATED THAT. AGENCY IN THE CASE OF PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH ELECTED BOARDS A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ALREADY EXISTS TO THE CORTESE KNOCKS HERTZBERG ACT- AND THAT'S THE WAY TO WORK WITH THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES ON WAY. I RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL VOTER. AS CSKA SHARED AMENDMENTS OF THE AUTHOR AND OTHERS- THAT WILL THAT WE HOPE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL VOTERS- WITHIN EXISTING DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WHILE STILL ESTABLISHING THE NEW LAST WEEK FOR THREE PROCESS FOR THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME DEMOCRATIC PROTECTIONS. ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DON'T INHIBIT PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM RECEIVING AND HELPING NEIGHBORING WATER SYSTEMS SOME CLOSING WITH ACT PASSED THE STATE COULD HELP ASSESS. AND EMPOWER OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE OF THEIR OWN LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS- HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND A WAY TO REACH OUR MUTUAL GOALS. BALLS STONE EXPECTING THESE DEMOCRATIC. INSTITUTE AND THE SELF DETERMINED. OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL THREE TIME. THE YOU NET WE'LL HEAR FOR C. TAR ON BEHALF OF THE- OF CAN WATER AGENCY. ACWA ARE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK IN MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH AQUA AQUA DOES HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AS BEFORE THREE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT SENATOR GONZALEZ HAS MADE TO DATE WE STILL HAVE TWO ISSUES WITH THE BILL. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT WERE OKAY WITH THE PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION AT THE READY FOR THE ADDRESS PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM BUT WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY FOR AT RISK DOMESTIC WELLS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DELETED. FONG THE STATE WATER BOARD DID JUST RELEASED THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE OFFER AUTHORED REFERENCED IN IN THAT DOCUMENT WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORK IDENTIFYING THE AT RISK WELLS OR THE HIGH RISK WELLS THEY SAY THE- THE STATE WATER BOARD STAFF STATE. THAT THAT DUE TO THE LACK OF DATA FROM ACTUAL STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELLS IT'S DIFFICULT TO PRECISELY DETERMINE THE COUNT OF THE AT RISK WELLS. ON THEY KNOW THAT THEY USE- PROXY DATA AND ASSUMPTIONS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE NOT THEY THEY'RE NOT USING INFORMATION THAT'S BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPLIANCE OF ANY. INDIVIDUAL WELL OUR SYSTEM. SO IT'S REALLY STE. ND WE DON'T IT FALL. AUTHORITY SHOULD BE BASED N A SPECULATIVE APPROACH. SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE- THE WATER BOARD BY THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO WORK ON IMPROVING THE DATA AND REFINING THAT RISK ASSESSMENT AND THAT'S GREAT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT THE STORY WEEKS PREMATURE. SO ON THE SECOND ISSUE WITH THE PUBLIC PROCESS ISSUE THE BILL NOW HAS A GOOD PUBLIC PROCESS STEP THAT THE POTENTIALLY SUBSUME WATER SYSTEM- COULD PROVIDE COMMENTS THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT AT RISK. AND IF THE SYSTEM DID SO THE WATER BOARD WOULD BE REQUIRED DURING A PUBLIC MEETING TO YOU KNOW CONSIDER THAT INFORMATION. IN IN THEIR DECISION MAKING. WE SUGGEST EXPANDING THAT NEW PROCESS STEP TO ADDITIONALLY ALLOW THE POTENTIALLY RECEIVING SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE ACTION. TO PROVIDE SUCH COMMENTS THAT THE SUBSUMED BOND SYSTEM IS NOT AT RISK- OR THAT YOU KNOW SYSTEM WELLS ARE NOT AT RISK AND THEN OF COURSE THE DECISION WOULD BE UP TO THE STATE WATER BOARD THAT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC PROCESS STEP TO ADD. SO THAT ANY- CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. OF THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU IT'S ALWAYS GOOD HEAR FROM AQUA. I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT WHAT THE BOARD IS DOING IS IT'S LOOKING AT AREAS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO HAVE CONTAMINATION SO WITH. THE SITE IS NEAR- ST UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK WHICH IS LEAKED- THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SYSTEM THE SYSTEM IS STILL THE- PEOPLE USING THE WELL. ARE STILL ACTIVE. ABLE TO CHALLENGE THAT. AND SHOW THAT IT IS WORTHWHILE SO THAT'S THE FIRST OBJECTION- THE SECOND ONE I'LL ASK THE- AUTHOR TO DISCUSSION OR CLOSE- THE R. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND ASK AFTER RISK SYSTEMS WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT MAJOR PROBLEMS- ALREADY THE BOARD CAN DEAL WITH- FAILING SYSTEMS. UP WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE AN ACT AT RISK SYSTEM SO DETERMINING WHICH SYSTEMS ARE AT RISK IS A VERY COMPLEX RECENT PROCESS THAT THE WATER BOARD UCLA DEVELOPED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY ARE WHICH IS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE NEEDS ASSESSMENT- AND- ONE IN PERSON AND FOR PUBLIC WOMEN ARE WE SHOULD GO WORKSHOPS WERE HELD. IT LOOKS AT A NUMBER OF RISK INDICATORS IT HAS THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE RISKS AND THEN IT DOES SCORES AND WAITS BUT THE SORT OF THING WE'RE LOOKING AT. IS AND YOU KNOW ANY ONE OF THESE I THINK AS A REASON TO BE CONCERNED HISTORY OF E. COLI PRESENCE CREASING THE PRESENCE OF WATER QUALITY TRENDS TOWARDS- THE MINIMUM. EXCELLENT CONTAMINANT LEVEL TREATMENT TECHNIQUES VIOLATIONS PAST PRESIDENTS. ON THE LIST MAXIMUM DURATION OF HIGH POTENTIAL EXPOSURES PERCENTAGES SOURCES EXPEDIENT- THE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT- ACCESSIBILITY NUMBER OF SOURCES ABSENCE OF INTER INTER TIES WATER SOURCE TYPES DROUGHT AND WATER SHORTAGE RISK CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS. AFFORDABILITY PERCENT OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY STREAMLINER BILLS AND THE PERCENT OF SHADOW SO THESE ARE VERY- AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TO. JUST THE NATURE OF THE- OUR SYSTEM ITSELF SO THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS MATTERS AND IF THEY'RE NOT FIXED NOW WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RISK OF PEOPLE BEING POISONED BY THE WATER IN THE FUTURE. SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET TOGETHER THESE- DISTRICTS SELL THAT- THEY HAVE ENOUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO FACE THIS ISSUE ALSO THE STATE WATER BOARD WILL BE A HAS FUNDS TO HELP THEM DO THE CONSOLIDATION SO. AGAIN THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASTERISK AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR- DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE- OKAY NOW WE CAN GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF S. B. FOUR ZERO THREE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE OF TWENTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

HI GOOD MORNING TURN NUMBERS TRIPLE GONZALEZ WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION PLANS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR- SO WE CAN NOW GO TO MEMBERS MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN MEMBERS I'D I FIRST WANT TO GO THROUGH SOME HISTORY- IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN- IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THINGS HAPPENING WITHIN MY OWN DISTRICT THREE IN REGARDS TO CHILE VILLAIN EXETER- THAT I'VE WORKED INTIMATELY WITH- FRANKLY OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AS WELL AS TOUCH ON THE ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE THIRTY NINE THE STATE WATER POLLUTION IS CLEAN UP. AND ABATEMENT. THAT COUNTS WHICH IS RECEIVED ZERO FUNDING FROM OUR STATE BODY SINCE WE ENACTED IT BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH SPECIFICALLY OF THAT BILL IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SUCH AREAS. FIRST THE TO THE BILL CITY OF EXETER. OUR SITUATION IS A SITUATION VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE FACED WITH EAST SIDE PORT OF ILL VERSUS THE CITY OF FORT OF L. THE- CITY OF EXETER SIMPLY LACKS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ABILITY. TO TIE IN A COMMUNITY THAT IS SEVERAL MILES. AWAY FROM THEM. SO THE FORCE CONSOLIDATION WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE COUNTY OF TULARE WHO HAS JURISDICTION OVER. THE COUNTY ISLAND OF TO THE BILL AND THE SUPERVISOR AT THE TIME WHO WAS SUPERVISOR KYLER CROCKER WHO IS NO LONGER SUPERVISOR AND WAS VOTED OUT- SOME MAY SPECULATE DUE TO HIS LACK OF ABILITY IN DEALING WITH CERTAIN THINGS- IN HIS IN THE ACCESSIBILITY ON CERTAIN ISSUES SUCH AS THIS- BUT I WILL NOT SPECULATE TO WHY VOTERS CHOSE TO REPLACE HIM WITH NOW SUPERVISOR LARRY MCCARTY. I KNOW BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN. THE SITUATION THOUGH IS THE FACT THAT THE COUNTY DEALS WITH THE SEWAGE TREATMENT OF THE TWO LEGAL COMMUNITY THEY DO WITH THE BILLING THEY DEAL WITH ALL OF THAT. THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT MANY OF THE HOMES WITHIN THE TO REVEAL COMMUNITY. STILL RELY ON SEPTIC TANK ISSUES. SO THE COUNTY DEALS WITH THAT AND DEALS WITH THEIR SEPTIC THEY HAVE A SPECIAL DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY FOR SEPTIC ISSUES THEY ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL DISTRICT BILLION WITH THEIR WATER IN THERE TO WELLS THAT THEY HAVE THAT HAVE CONTAMINATION ISSUES PARTIALLY IN PART TO THE FAILING SEPTIC ISSUES. AGAIN HAVE WORKED ON THIS INTIMATELY FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE ISSUE THEN BECOMES IF WE DO RUN A LINE. TO THE SAID CITY IN IN THIS ISN'T SPECIFIC JUST FOR THE TO LOUISVILLE THIS IS THE SAME STORY ACROSS OUR STATE. IS THAT WE HAVE COUNTY ISLANDS. THAT SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD. WE ALSO HAVE COUNTY ISLANDS THAT IN INTO THE BILL'S HISTORY THE PAST. FOLKS WHO RAN THEIR WATER SYSTEM FRANKLY. IS THERE TO SHOW THEY THEY'RE SIMPLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE MONEY THEY DID AT. GOBLIN AWAY DUE TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AGAIN THIS ISN'T A STORY JUST TO THIS SMALL COMMUNITY OF TOTALLY THE- NOW DO YOU HAVE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A CITY YOU HAVE A COUNTY ISLAND IT. LOGICAL THAT THEY TI&lt;c.cyan&gt;. WHO PAYS FOR IT THE&lt;/c&gt; FACT IS UNDER CURRENT UTILITY CODE MEMBERS AND SENATOR THAT IF YOU ADD THAT ADDITIONAL LINE. THE NEW PEOPLE TIED INTO THAT LINE ARE NOW FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR SAID LINE. THAT'S UTILITY COAT AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS. CHAU THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE SMALL COUNTY ISLANDS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD THAT ADDITIONAL COST BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CAN'T AFFORD THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET FIXED WE HAVE SEEN THIS ON THE MISTER SALAS IS DISTRICT IN MR ARAMBULA IS DISTRICT- IF YOU TAKE ANY OF THE WATER TOWARDS ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- NOW U. S. SENATOR ALEX VIDEO ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HIM OUT AT SOME WE HAVE SEEN WATER TREATMENT PLANTS PUT IN TO DO A ARSENIC ISSUES TO DEAL WITH NITROGEN ISSUES TO DEAL WITH THE TOXICITY ISSUES. THAT THESE COMMUNITIES FACE AND THE FACT IS MANY OF THESE PLANTS ARE MOTHBALLED BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE PUT INTO SERVICE CANNOT AFFORD. TO PAY TO RUN THE TREATMENT PLANTS AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE WATER THAT THE TREATMENT PLANTS PRODUCE FOR THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHICH LEADS ME TO THE POINT. WITH ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY NINE WHICH I AUTHORED AND IT WAS NOT MY FIRST ATTEMPT WE TOOK THREE YEARS. TO BUILD THIS OUT FROM MY FRESHMAN YEAR INTO MY SOPHOMORE YEAR. IN WHAT THIS ACCOUNT DOES IS IT LITERALLY PAYS FOR THE TREATMENT PLANTS. IN FROM THE BILL TAX I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY DURING THE DISCUSSION TO PULL IT UP. IF WE GO DOWN INTO SECTION. TWO WHICH DEALS WITH THE ELIGIBILITY. PUBLIC AGENCIES TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. AND IT GOES ON AND ON WE WROTE THIS IN FINE TOOTH THIS. MANY MEMBERS HERE HELPED ME WITH THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE AS A JUNIOR REPUBLICAN TEMPERATURE AND HE MEGA MAJORITY DEMOCRAT HOUSE IT TOOK ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. BUT AGAIN. THERE HAS BEEN ZERO FUNDING PUT INTO THE ACCOUNT THAT WAS DESIGNED. TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THESE DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES THE SMALL COUNTY ISLAND COMMUNITIES LIKE TO LEAVE. NO MONEY. IN OUR STATE BUDGET YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR I PUT IN THE BUDGET REQUEST EVERY SINGLE YEARS WELL. I KNOW SENATOR HER TITLE I KNOW SOME OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CAUCUS MEMBERS HAVE ASKED FOR FUNDING IN THAT ACCOUNT. IT HAS NOT HAPPENED. THE CONCERN. IN YOU ALL BUT I THE HISTORY IS IMPORTANT HERE. THIS BILL THE FORCED CONSOLIDATION OF THESE DISTRICTS THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT HERE. WHO FUNDS IT HOW DOES THE BILLING METRICS GET SET UP. ARE WE INCORPORATING JUST THE WATER OR WE INCORPORATING THE SEWAGE IF THE SEWAGE IS ALREADY THERE IN A BILLING MECHANISM IS THERE SAY WITH THE COUNTY DO THEY THEN GET JURISDICTION OVER THAT. AND ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WHICH THEY OUGHT TO. BECAUSE IF WE FORCE THE CONSOLIDATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WE HAVE A SEWAGE SYSTEM DISTRICT ON TOP OF IT. NOW CONSOLIDATED WITH THE CITY SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY DEALING WITH CITY AND SEWAGE. BECAUSE THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE ASKING A STRUGGLING SMALL CITY. WHO ALREADY HAS FUNDING ISSUES. THEY THEY MAY OR MAY NOT I AM SET DOWN WITH THE CITY MANAGER NEXT TERM ENTITLEMENT AT THE FOR A COUPLE YEARS ON THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE MECHANISMS WE KNOW THE COUNTY NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF THIS. WE KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN THREADED THAT NEEDLE JUST RIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THESE THINGS WORK. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY. THOUGHTFUL. I'M THINKING ABOUT IT'S NOT JUST CONSOLIDATING WATER. IT'S WATER IN SEWAGE TOGETHER WATER WAS IN THE HOUSE IT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF THE HOUSE IT'S GOT TO GO TO A TREATMENT PLAN HAS GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT LITTLE STEPS. THAT FRANKLY I DON'T SEE IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY SENATOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. I THINK IS BE EITHER TAKE A POSITIVE AND HOLD BACK MUCH COMPAQ LATER WE'D HAVE TIME IN THIS SESSION TO MAKE THIS BETTER BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE RIGHT AND I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU WITH THAT I LOVE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL VISIT CURRENTLY IS MEMBERS I ASK YOU ALL FOR AN OVER. THANK YOU- THANK YOUS ARE. VERY MUCH- OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS ALL RIGHT I'LL JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT- THREE GOOD ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROUGHT UP IT IS UP TO THE WATER BOARD TO DECIDE ON THESE THINGS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CONSOLIDATING THE SEWER SYSTEM. THAT I CAN ANSWER BUT AS FAR AS- FOR EXAMPLE THE ENTIRE TIME. IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO. CONSOLIDATE UNLESS THERE WERE AN INTERTIDAL BOARD HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THAT INNER TIE SO I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD CONSOLIDATE WITHOUT SPENDING THE MONEY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE CONSOLIDATED SO I THINK THAT THAT PART IS TAKEN CARE OF- IF YOU'RE ANYONE ELSE A YES MISTER MURATSUCHI.

THANK YOU. OKAY- I'LL MAKE ANOTHER COMMENT AGAIN IN RESPONSE TO THE GOOD QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS- AFFORDABILITY IS PART OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER AND THE WATER BOARD MUST CONSIDER THAT MANY CONSOLIDATION EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES ALSO- HAS LIMITATIONS ON CHARGING CUSTOMERS MORE. THERE'S ALSO S. B. TWO HUNDRED FUNDING THAT CAN PROVIDE MONEY FOR THESE CONSOLIDATIONS- THEY GET AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY S. B. TWO HUNDRED MONEY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION A YEAR FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS- FUNDS- OR GENERAL FUND IF- IF THERE AREN'T THE MONEY IF THERE ISN'T THE MONEY FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS SO THERE IS MONEY TO DO THIS THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT STATE THEY HAVE TO- IN FACT ON THOSE INTERTIDAL BRING IT TOGETHER. AND THEY DO HAVE MONEY TO DO IT- SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTES WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH MANY MEMBERS THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT- AND I JUST WANT TO BUILD OFF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA IN OUR BACKYARD AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES LIKE IT IS TO TRULY BILL IN. PORTER BILL IN AND MANY PLACES IN CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND RESPECT LAST NIGHT- SO I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO BRING THE SYSTEMS- TOGETHER- GIVEN THE WATER BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO DO THIS- AND AGAIN IT'S- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUITE SERIOUS. AT RISK ARE THE ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SYSTEMATIC RISK. WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE POISONED ON THE WAY TO BECOME FAILING.

AS YOU SAID OUR WORK ON THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS- CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE OF THE REQUESTS FROM ATWATER THAT. YOU SAID YOU WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO.
