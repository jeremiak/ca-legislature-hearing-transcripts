MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY AND THE VAST DISPARITIES SEEN ACROSS THE STATE I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES. BUT AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THE BILL DOES NOT PURCHASE COUNTIES HAVE THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY. I HAVE OTHER CONCERNS AS WELL WHICH I'VE SHARED WITH THE AUTHORED THIS BILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. THEREFORE I'M PULLING THE THIS BILL FROM THE HEARING TODAY BUT LET'S START WITH THE STOP MOTION A QUORUM WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE- AT. WE DO. FIVE OKAY WE DO. UNTIL THEN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PORTATO HERE. RETARDER HERE JONES CORTESE CORTESE HERE COM LONGER CAN HERE AND HERE. OKAY AND- WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A FORMIDABLE. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN- TO HEAR THE FIRST BILL ON THE AGENDA ITEM WHICH IS AGENDA ITEM TO AND SENATOR SKINNER'S HERE TO PRESENT SENATOR SKINNER PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. MADAM CHAIRS- ITEM TO SB. THREE SIX FOUR. YES AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWO SENATE BILL THREE SIX COUNTY AGENDA IN FRONT OF ME I'D- AND- I WOULD ONLY LIKE TO REGISTER THAT I WAS ONLY INFORMED THAT SB SIXTY FIVE WAS BEING PULLED ABOUT BABY HALF HOUR AGO. SO AND- I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR. SB. THREE SIXTY FOUR. IS IN EFFECT A VERY SIMPLE CONCEPT AND THAT IS THAT WE PROVIDE FREE EDUCATION NOW THAT IS OUR POLICY SO EVERY CHILD AT EVERY K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENT CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO ATTEND A PUBLIC SCHOOL FREE OF CHARGE. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN THAT ARE FED NUTRITIOUS MEALS I'M NOT HUNGRY DO MUCH BETTER IN CHOOL WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY A CHILD MAY SHOW UP AT SCHOOL. NOT HAVING YET BEEN FED AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THOSE CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES ARE- HAVE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS OR OTHERS MAY FALL INTO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MORE THAN OTHER CHILDREN BUT ANY CHILD COULD BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY- ARRIVE AT SCHOOL. AND HAVEN'T BEEN ADEQUATELY FED AND THUS ARE NOT AS ABLE TO PERFORM WELL AT SCHOOL. SO WHAT SB THREE SIXTY FOUR DOES IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE PROVIDE FREE SCHOOL. IT ENSURES THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE FED A FREE MEAL. NOW THE BENEFIT OF THAT BESIDES THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE. MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES AT SCHOOL IS THAT WE REMOVE THE STIGMA. FROM THOSE CHILDREN WHO WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM AND ITS FOR FEDERALLY SUPPORTED FOR. FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH AND MANY CHILDREN GET THEN THE MEAL FREE OTHER CHILDREN ONLY PAY A PARTIAL COST. BUT FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE'S A STIGMA TO THAT WE ALSO HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOME PARENTS ARE EITHER AREN'T AWARE OR DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO APPLY. AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FREE MEAL THE- SCHOOL HAS TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE TO GET PARENTS TO APPLY. FOR THE- OR THE GUARDIAN TO APPLY FOR THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH THAN DOING INCOME VERIFICATION. AND THEN- THE CHILD IS- THEN PROVIDED IS A SAID EITHER A PARTIAL- EIGHT HAVE TO PARTIALLY PAY OR FREE MEALS. NOW THIS BILL WHAT IS AYE INDICATE PUT US ON THE PATHWAY OF FREE MEALS AT SCHOOL. AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP US MAXIMIZE THE FEDERAL MONEY. THAT WE RECEIVED TO HELP COVER THOSE COSTS. AT&amp;T ADDITIONALLY IN THE BILL THERE IS A GRANT PROGRAM THAT BUILDS UPON AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOW PARTICIPATE IN. WHICH IS CONNECTS THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD PRODUCERS AND FARMERS. AND ALLOWS THEM THEY THEN PURCHASE DIRECTLY AND THE CHILDREN ARE THEN OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS BUT ALSO IN GENERAL BECAUSE WE ARE THE BURKE A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE AND SUCH A PRODUCER'S. BID IS HEALTHIER AND FOOD ALSO THE AT THOSE SCHOOLS SO. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT. THIS BILL DOES AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY- ROCIO PEREA THIS FOR THE CENTER FOR LAW AND SOCIAL POLICY SPEAK AND ALSO CRYSTAL FITZSIMONS FROM THE FOOD RESEARCH AND ACTION CENTER. AND WILL BEGIN WITH THE FIRST LEAD SUPPORT TO TESTIFY ON THIS BILL. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. MODERATED WE HAVE PRESS ZERO PRESS ON THE LINE.

THANK YOU- THE- WELL ONE THING I LEARNED TODAY WHICH I FORGOT TO NOTE MY OPENING. IS THAT I THINK SO. THIS IS A RELEVANT TO TODAY BUT I THINK SOME OF US MAY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO TALK A LOT ABOUT- THAT UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS A FREE MEAL SHOULD BE PART OF SCHOOLS. BUT TODAY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXTENDING WHAT'S CALLED THE SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION. FOR THIS COMING SUMMER AND WHAT THAT IS THE FEDERAL. SUMMER SCHOOL SUMMER LUNCH PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO ALL SIX KIDS IT IS NOT MEANS TESTED SO WE NOW HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THIS WITHOUT STATUTE FOR THIS SUMMER- SO THAT IS GREAT. AND IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN WE ENACT SB THREE SIXTY FOUR THEN WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA IN THE DIFFERENT WE WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO REALLY ENACT STATUTES LIKE THIS BUT IT IS A TREND THAT I THINK WE SEE NOW BEING TALKED ABOUT. AND MOVED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STATES AND THEN FINALLY. HAS SOME OF THE WITNESSES MENTIONED- A KEY ELEMENT OF THE BILL IS ALSO THIS BETTER OUT OF SCHOOL TIME NUTRITION PROGRAM CALLED BOOST. WHICH IS MODELED AFTER THE PANDEMIC EBT PROGRAM THAT IS EXISTED IN THIS LAST. YEAR WHICH ALLOWS FOR WHEN A SCHOOL IS CLOSED SO LET'S H. DURING THE VACATION TIME OR DURING BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY OR DISASTER PUBLIC HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE WE FACED. BACK TO SCHOOL COULD PROVIDE ANY BT CARD TO THE FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE PROVIDE MEALS FOR THE SHOW THAT WE DO NOT HAVE HUNGRY- STUDENTS.

SORRY JUST RAN UP A BUNCH OF FLIGHTS OF STAIRS- JUST GOOD AFTERNOON AND I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN WHICH DEALS WITH SERVICES AND SELF DETERMINATION FOR PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE STATE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WAS RAMPED UP IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IN PART. BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JERRY WALL THE WHOSE SON WORKED WITH THE TWO OF US- CENTERED AROUND RESIDENTIAL STATE HOSPITALS AND LOCAL SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH NEWLY ESTABLISHED REGIONAL CENTERS. OVER THE LAST DECADE TO STATE HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN PHASED OUT. AND SERVICES ARE DELIVERED ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH LOCAL PROGRAMS FOR THE STATE TO STRUGGLE TO ADEQUATELY FUND LOCAL SERVICES. ENSURE THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE SERVICES AT THAT LEVEL. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SENATOR BILL EMERSON AUTHORED SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY EIGHT WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE WIDE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS BASED ON SUCCESSFUL MULTI YEAR SELF DETERMINATION PILOT PROJECTS WHICH GAVE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AUTHENTIC PERSON CENTERED PLANNING CHOICE AND CONTROL OVER THEIR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. IN ADDITION TO BETTER OUTCOMES. WITH POTENTIAL LONG TERM COST SAVINGS THERE BEEN DELAYS EVER SINCE TEN FIRST AND GETTING A FEDERAL WAIVER FOR THIS NEW OUGHT TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND NOW FOR THREE YEARS AFTER THE WAIVER JUST A FRACTION OF THE ELIGIBLE FAMILIES HAVE DEVELOP SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. IT IS BEEN MADE EVEN HARDER DURING THE LAST YEAR TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT THERE WAS SLOW IMPLEMENTATION EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM OMBUDSPERSON. AN INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS ENTITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO AMONG OTHER THINGS ASSIST SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO FULL PARTICIPATION AND INCLUSION. THE OMBUDSPERSON WILL WORK TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION AND INCREASE PARTICIPANTS CHOICE AND FLEXIBILITY. IT WILL EQUIP THE OMBUDSPERSON TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE TRAININGS. FOR SERVICE COORDINATORS WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AND TO WORK WITH PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO OBTAIN THE PERSON SERVICES AND SUPPORT THEY DESERVE. I'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE I GOT HERE. THE MOST RECENT TIME BUT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS ALL THE CONVERSATIONS AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDER INTEREST HAS RESULTED IN THIS BILL SO TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THE SENATOR BILL AMBERSONS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF SB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TIM JAN BOARD MEMBER OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED AND SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING.

THANK SENATOR MERCED AND I BELIEVE WE ARE HAVE- BIG SUPPORT OF TWO ON THE CALL. YEAH PLEASE PLAY MY NAME IS TO CHEN I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL IN OF THE B. ONE EIGHT. IT IS MY- I MADE FORTY YEAR OLD KOREAN AMERICAN MAN WHO HAS CEREBRAL PALSY. I AM USING A COMMUNICATION DEVICE AT THE BASE OF MY WHEELCHAIR BY TYPING WITH MY TONGUE. MY PRONOUNS ARE HE AND HIM BUT IF YOU ASK MY FRIENDS THEY HAVE OTHER PRONOUNS FOR ME THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE TO MENTION IN A SENATE HEARING. I AM ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED STATES WIDE ORGANIZATION DIRECTED BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. B. R. COSPONSORING SB FIVE ONE EIGHT ALONG WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THIS WEEKEND WE HELD A VIRTUAL SELF DETERMINATION CONFERENCE WITH ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE SIGNED UP. THERE WAS SO MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE STATE WIDE ROLL OUT IN JUNE AND YOU MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES HAVE FACED. I WAS SELECTED TO GO INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUT IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET STARTED. FROM THE BEGINNING BY REGIONAL CENTER HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE. SERVICE CO ORDINATOR ACTUALLY SENT ME AN EMAIL SAYING THE PROGRAM IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD BY REGIONAL CENTERS THAT SELF DETERMINATION IS TOO HARD. HE HEARD THIS REPEATEDLY AT THE CONFERENCE PARTICULARLY FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR. PEOPLE WANT TO GO INTO THE STP BUT THE BARRIERS ARE SO CLEAR AND PROFOUND. IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE'LL HEAR CONSISTENT THEMES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE BECAUSE OF REGIONAL CENTER RESISTANCE I BUCKLE. THERE IS A REPORT FROM THE STATE WIDE SELF DETERMINATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT REALLY GOES INTO DETAIL WITH RECOMMENDATIONS MOST OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED. LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE BARRIERS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT HAS TAKEN SO DARN LONG FOR GPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. WE ARE ALMOST AT EIGHT YEARS. IT REALLY LOST MOMENTUM FOR THE PROGRAM. BUT THE ENERGY HAS RETURNED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE STATE WIDE ROLL OUT IN JUNE. ANOTHER MAJOR BARRIER FACT WHILE PARTICIPANTS AND FAMILIES HAVE TO GO TO AN OVERLY COMPLICATED ORIENTATION REGIONAL CENTER STAFF ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY TRAINING. WE HEAR THAT MANY SERVICE CO ORDINATORS DON'T INTERSTELLAR IN THE PROGRAM KEEPING THEIR CLIENTS FROM MOVING FORWARD. SB FIVE ONE EIGHT WILL REMEDY THAT SITUATION BY REQUIRING ONLY GENERAL CENTER STAFF GET TRAINING ON THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES REGIONAL CENTERS TO INFORM ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. SB FIVE ONE EIGHT DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT. IT CREATES THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON FOR THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WHO WOULD INVESTIGATE THE BARRIERS WE ARE FACING AND HELP US TO OVERCOME THAT. BEYOND BUDGET PERSON WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. WE ARE HOPING THAT SB FIVE ONE EIGHT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE WILL ENSURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON OFFICE AND CONTAINER DIVISIONAL PROVISIONS. SUCH AS ADDING CLEAR TIMELINES FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH ROAD. BUT AS WITH OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT FREEDOM IS ALWAYS WORTH IT. I DON'T SEE THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WAS JUST A DIFFERENT WAY TO RECEIVE SERVICES. I SEE HAVING CHOICE AND CONTROL OVER ONE'S LIFE AS A BASIC CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHT. THAT IS WHY WE NEED THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM TO SUCCEED AND SB FIVE ONE EIGHT WILL HELP US TO GET THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TEMPER TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- AT THIS MOMENT I WANT TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE ONE EIGHT DOUBLE BEGIN WITH ROOM FOR. FORTY TWO ZERO THREE. C.

PEOPLE ENGAGE OUT ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- WELL I KNOW THAT THE I THINK BILL TO PROTECT IS ABOUT- BUT- BUT IT'S BEEN RELATE TO THIS THIS. TO PRO. THAT- THERE MIGHT BE OTHER- PLACES IN- DEVELOPMENTS. WELL CERTAIN WE HAVE MANY VERY FOR PEOPLE PROVIDING SERVICES WHERE AND- MAY BE USEFUL. AS WELL. WAS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. ON SELF DETERMINATION- AND WANTING TO SEE THAT. EARLY PASS I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR TRADITIONAL REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM REALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE AUTHORITY THAT SELF DETERMINATION DOES I TO- AGREE WITH DOCTOR PAN THAT THE FACT THAT WE ONLY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM IS PALTRY. TO SAY THE LEAST ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF- FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS WONDERING- AS IT RELATES TO THE OMBUDSMAN. THE BILL SAYS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN WOULD BE IN DDS AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANY THOUGHT TO HAVING IT OUTSIDE OF DDS SINCE DDS IS THE ENTITY THAT IT WOULD BE MONITORING. OKAY MADAM CHAIR I GUESS TO THE CHAIR PLEASE BUT- YES. WE GAVE A LOT OF THOUGHT TO THIS AND TRIED TO. DO IT SO IT'S INDEPENDENT WITH IN THERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO PUT IT IN. OUR BE HONEST WE NEED TO GET THIS BILL SIGNED AS WELL AND SO I THINK TRYING TO DO IT INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WAS OUR BEST STRATEGY. WHY WOULD I JUST ENCOURAGE US TO BE AS BOLD AS POSSIBLE WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE- THE DD COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN- FOR MANY MANY LEGISLATIVE CYCLES- AND THEY ARE HURTING SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND- WE ENCOURAGE US SAYS GET THAT GRASS OF LEE BOLD- IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO. PROVIDE THE KIND OF INDEPENDENCE AND- AUTHORITY THAT I THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON SB FIVE ONE EIGHT. NO OKAY CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES FIRST LET ME JUST- I KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED IN LET ME THANK THE MALL AND JUST SAY THAT WHILE THEY THANK ME THEY REALLY SHOULD BE THANKING. THE FAMILIES AND EVERYBODY THAT WORKS IN THIS FIELD BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF FOR HER ROLE WE CAN ACTIONS AND WORK IS GOING ON. AND TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY SENATOR ARE CALM LONGER. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY. GROUP ONE I WAS. YOUR CHAIR IN MY PREVIOUS INCARNATION. THE R. HOSPITALS WERE BEING CLOSED DOWN. AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITALS WERE GOING TO LOCAL SERVICES. AND AT THE TIME IT WAS A CLICHE. THAT 80% OF THE MONEY WENT 220% OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM. THAT AND THEN REGIONAL LOCATIONS WHERE THERE WERE EIGHTY PERCENT. AND WHEN THE STATE CLOSE DOWN THE HOSPITAL SENATE A LOT OF IT WAS MONEY THAT WAS SO CALLED SAVED BY THE HOSPITALS DID NOT MOVE TO LOCAL SERVICES. AND SO. ARE WHEN IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE RIGHTEOUS. ACTION THIS IS ALSO A BUDGET ISSUE AS WELL AS MAKING THE SELF DETERMINATION PLANTS WORK AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HERE ABOUT THIS BILL. AND WE'RE HERE ABOUT MAKING SELF DETERMINATION WORK. AND IT IS REALLY. A THING WE HAVE TO DO BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND OTHER- FORMATS AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE. THE TIME HAS BEEN SPENT ON THIS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR KNOWING FROM. THANK YOU- AND AT THIS MOMENT A COUPLE TO KEEP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR PAN. SB FIVE ONE EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST. RE REFER TO COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY HER TADO I HER TADO I'D JONES JONES III CORTESE. CORTEZ THE ICON MARKER HI COM LONGER I'D PAN NIGHT AND I. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE VOTE IS FIVE ZERO AND THE BILL IS OUT- UP NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR RUBIO FOR A CHEN HERE TO PRESENT ON THE AGENDA ITEM NUMBER SIX SB. FIVE THREE SEVEN. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WHICH AIMS TO ADDRESS EXISTING ISSUES WITH FAILURE TO PROTECT LAWS AND TO CREATE A CRITICAL WORKING GROUP TO FURTHER ANALYZE TRACK THE DATA AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WAYS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES COMMITTEE MEMBERS VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH TRAUMA ISOLATION AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABUSE THAT THEY'VE ENTERED AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WE CANNOT RE TRAUMATIZE VICTIMS BY REMOVING THEIR CHILDREN SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF BEING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN HER COMMITTEE STAFF- AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WORKED AND ENGAGED WITH ME ON THIS BILL I WANT TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED. THE PROBLEM WE CURRENTLY HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO PHILLY TO PROTECT IS THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION WHEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS FOUND IN THE HOME AS WELL AS A LACK OF SERVICES WE PROVIDE. TO VICTIMS FACING ABUSE. FAILURE TO PROTECT LAWS ARE DESIGNED TO GUARD CHILDREN FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EXPENDABLES ARE TO INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE HOWEVER. IN MANY CASES THESE LAWS ARE CONTINUING TO PUT FAMILIES AND VICTIMS AT A DISADVANTAGE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY DEALING WITH TRAUMA. WE MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD DISCUSSION AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENSURE THAT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES WORK CLOSELY WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS THE MANY CHILDREN THAT ARE DYING. AT THE HANDS OF ABUSERS. I KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT SECTION THREE HUNDRED AND THIS BILL AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE WILL BE WORKING OUT IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. BUT ON BEHALF OF PEAKY A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. AND MY DISTRICT WHO DIED AT THE HANDS OF HIS FATHER WHEN THE COURTS FAILED TO LISTEN TO HIS MOTHER AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHER CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED OR PUT IN HARM'S WAY. DUE TO THE FAILURE TO PROTECT LOSS AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. I URGE AN IDOL THANK YOU. ON THE PHONE TODAY IF I MAY I WANTED TO DO SOME OF MY WITNESS AMINAH MERIT ATTORNEY AT THE MERRITT LAW CLINIC. AND A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO IN YOUR OFFICE FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL AND HAVING YOU TESTIFIED TODAY IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN I BELIEVE I BEAR THE QUALIFICATIONS TO TESTIFY HAVING WORKED IN THE AREA OF CHILD WELFARE AND JUVENILE DEPENDENCY LAW. SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES RENDON PROFESSOR LATER SENATOR NOW LA SUPERVISOR SHEILA KEWELL KEWELL SCHOOLED ME ON THIS AREA AND PRACTICES AND THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN THROUGH THE EYES OF THE LAW WHILE I WAS A STUDENT AT USC GOULD SCHOOL OF BLACK. IN THE NINETIES I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING FOR AN INSURANCE DEFENSE FIRM IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES REPRESENTING THEN DPSS LATER DCFS IN CASES INVOLVING DEATH OR INJURIES TO CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND THEN THE NOTORIOUS MCLAREN HOLLOW LOS ANGELENOS JUVENILE HALL IN EAST LA. AND LATE. USE NEAR LAKE CHRISTIAN. LATER BECAME AN ATTORNEY AT SAC IT'S ADVOCATES AND LATER CHILDREN LOS. AND HAVE THAT AS COUNSEL COURT APPOINTED AND PRIVATELY COUNCIL FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN SACRAMENTO YOLO PLASTER CONTRA COSTA AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. I TESTIFIED FOR THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON FOSTER CARE LED BY SENATOR KAREN BASS WHICH I BELIEVE HELPS THEM AND- WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION THREE SIXTY ONE POINT THREE THE RELATIVE PLACEMENT PREFERENCE. I ALSO WORK TO TEMPORARILY WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE COURTS THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CONDUCTING TITLE FOR E. REVIEWS OF THE JUVENILE COURT. IN SAN ANDREAS AND SANTA BARBARA AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. EAST THIRTY FIVE PLUS YEARS OF WORK IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM HAVE GIVEN ME A FIRSTHAND VIEW OF WHAT I BELIEVE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FROM INTENSIFIED SOCIAL SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DESPITE THE ENACTMENT OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED POINT FOUR IN MY EXPERIENCE SECTION THREE HUNDRED BE KNOWN BY PRACTITIONERS AS THE QUOTE UNQUOTE CATCH ALL PHRASE. ALLOWS SOCIAL SERVICES TO ALLEGE THAT PARENTS QUOTE ENGAGED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CLOSE THEIR BY FORMING THE BASIS FOR A SUSTAINED CONDITION WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. CALLING A VICTIM SOMEONE ENGAGED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHAU THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THIS FAMILY SEPARATION WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING THE TRAUMA TO THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE. THE ALLEGATIONS OFTEN SHOW A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF FAMILY VIOLENCE THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE AND THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE FROM A TRAUMA INFORMED OPPRESSION LENDEDU POINT. IT JUST STICKS WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT CBS SAYS R. DOT BERKELEY DOT EDU THE UC BERKELEY WEBSITE. OUR FOSTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA WE'LL SHOW THAT YOU'RE- OUR CASES AND THE- OF COLOR. AND IT IS COURT ALITY OF THEM BY CAN AMONG THE- RESPONSES FORGET THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO GO TO COURT YOU NOT. REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM IT CHILDREN TRAUMATIZED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE RE TRAUMATIZED BY FAMILY SEPARATION THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE RE TRAUMATIZED BY A SYSTEM THAT TAKES AWAY SOME OF THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IMPROVISATION IMPROPER AGED FAMILIES ARE TOLD TO GO TO FAMILY COURT WHICH HAS NO COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEYS TO GET RESTRAINING ORDERS FURTHER SEPARATING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND CAUSING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL THE FACT. I CAN CITE THREE BRIEFCASE EXAMPLES SHOW THE GROWTH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALLEGATIONS UNDER SECTION THREE HUNDRED B. THREE HUNDRED POINTS FOR OUR BLACK BROWN LGBTQ ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS IMMIGRANTS AN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITY. ONE CASE YOU'RE A WEDGE BETWEEN A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THE STATUTORY TIME FOR REUNIFICATION ANOTHER CONTINUETO BE ABUSED AND TRAFFICKED BY THE PERPETRATOR AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF I LOOK IN THE RIGHT PLACE ON THE INTERNET. I COULD PROBABLY FIND BOTH THE MOTHER AND NOW ADULT DAUGHTERS CONTINUING TO BE TRAFFIC. BACK CASE WITH THE FAILURE TO RENDON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ANOTHER CASE ALMOST FINANCIALLY DESTROYED AN EXTENDED IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO EARN JUST OVER THE AMOUNT FOR COURT APPOINTED COUNSEL THE DAUGHTER HER HUSBAND AND CHILD HAD YOU MOVED. FROM THE PARENTS GRANDPARENTS HOME OVER SPEECHES ALLEGATIONS THAT ALSO DERAILED THEIR PLAN TO PURCHASE A HOUSE THEY HAD TO BUY AN APARTMENT AND FIND OTHER CHILD CARE BECAUSE OF A SOUL ALLEGATION OF FAMILY VIOLENCE IN THE FORM OF A SPANKING. THE FINAL CASE. A SINGLE FATHER IN THE BAY AREA SQUARE ASKED GET EVERY.ORDER IN THEM OF HIS TEAM BOYS WHEN HE AND MORE HER TO BE A TO MAKE. OUR VISITS AND REPLACE. WITH THEM HE WAS TOLD THAT IF HE DIDN'T DO SO THE BOYS COULD BE REMOVED FROM HIM AND A PETITIONS AND STAINED DUE TO HIS NICKELBACK. MY EXPERIENCE INFORMS ME THAT THE PROPOSAL SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WILL BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION REQUIRING A CLOSE LOOK AT THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND EXAMINE WHAT WE DO TO. ADDRESS OUR FOR FAMILIES WE ARE STILL SWORN TO PROTECT DOING SO WILL FURTHER THE OVERRIDING BONES OF THE JUVENILE COURT TO AVOID FAMILY SEPARATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF FOSTER CARE WHENEVER POSSIBLE. LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES AND COURT HEARINGS EMPLOYMENT TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES DURING OPPRESSION LOANS TO STRENGTHEN AND RESTORE FAMILIES THROUGH THE PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE CAN DEVELOP PEACEFUL AND ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNITIES.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT BILL FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR- GOOD WORK ON THE BALLOT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS. SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH THE FARMWORKER DISASTER RELIEF PLANNING TASK FORCE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEEDS OF FARMWORKERS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR IMMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE AND LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET SERVICES AND OTHER SOCIAL AND AT ECONOMIC RELIEF DURING DISASTERS AND PANDEMICS. CREATING THIS TASK FORCE IS CRITICAL FOR OUR STATE TO BE IN A POSITION TO ASSIST FARMWORKERS DURING THE MOST CRITICAL TIME OF NEED AND DURING TIMES OF DISASTERS FARMWORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE. IN OUR STATE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS WE EXPERIENCE CLIMATE RELATED EMERGENCY VET EVENTS SUCH AS WILDFIRES AND DROUGHTS LAST YEAR FARMWORKERS SUFFERED GREATLY DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF THE WILDFIRES WELL AIR QUALITY ADVISEMENT RECOMMENDED THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STAY INDOORS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF REALLY POOR AIR QUALITY FARMWORKERS WERE LEFT WORKING IN THE FIELDS THEIR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SECURITY WERE THREATENED. FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES FEEL LEFT BEHIND AND RIGHTLY SO THEIR COMMUNITIES LIKE MANY RESOURCES THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED INCLUDING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AFFORDABLE HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND FOOD IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS I PARTICIPATED IN MANY FOOD AND PP DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT AND I'VE SEEN THE GREAT NEED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THESE HARD WORKING FAMILIES AND TO ENSURE SUCH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED IN A COORDINATED. EFFICIENT AND NIMBLE APPROACH AS YOU KNOW THE STATE RELIES ON OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO DELIVER SERVICES AND QUITE FRANKLY WITH SIX COUNTIES THAT AS I WAS TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ON- EXACTLY THE BUCKEYE OF RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE. EVERY COUNTY DID THEIR PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GIVE ADVICE WHEN WE WOULD GET CALLS FROM FARMWORKERS SAYING HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHERE DO I GO WHAT DO I DO. AND EVERY COUNTY HAD A DIFFERENT METRIC THEY WERE USING A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION AND IT AND MANY OF THEM FRANKLY WERE LEFT WITHOUT ANY RESOURCES AT ALL. THE LACK OF THE LACK OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THE PANDEMIC AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO P. P. AND COVERT TESTING. LACK OF ACCESS TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ASSISTANT PROGRAMS. CREATED ANXIETY AND QUITE FRANKLY PANIC IN MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO SAW THE NEED FOR BETTER COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH FARMWORKERS. AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS OFTEN OFTEN TIMES DID NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THEIR IN FOR THEIR INPUT. WHAT I PROPOSE THAT THIS BILL IS A CALIFORNIA DO BETTER. THE TASK FORCE WILL HELP OUR STATE TO RESPOND WITH AN EQUITY LENS. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JOEL DERRINGER OF DERRINGER AND ASSOCIATES AND A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR FARMWORKERS HEALTH AND SAFETY. DO WE HAVE FEDERAL ON THE LINE. YES I AM OKAY. PLEASE BEGINNING YOU ALREADY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SENATOR HER TADO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SENATE CUT BY ABOUT QUARTER BEING A CHAMPION FOR FARMWORKERS AND FOR THIS BILL. IT WAS DESIGNED TO FORM A FARM DISASTER PLANNING TASK FORCE SO WE CAN LEARN FROM PAST DISASTERS ADDRESSED THE PRESIDENT OF FASTER. AND PREPARE FOR FUTURE DISASTERS WILL PREPARE CLIMATE RELATED PANDEMIC RELATED OR ECONOMIC. AS AN EXAMPLE THE DROUGHT IS UPON US AGAIN WHAT PROJECTED JOB LOSSES AND ECONOMIC IMPACT IN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. MANY LEGISLATORS HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN THE GOVERNOR SEEKING AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND THIS WEEK BUT SHARES OF THE BORDERS PORTS OF SUPERVISORS BUT SEMI KING BALLY COUNTIES JOINED IN THAT EFFORT. AS WE LEARNED IN THE PAST. SPEND A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN COMMUNITIES. THERE'S ALSO BEEN. EIGHTY FIVE ZERO WELL MEANING STATE TRIGGERED RESPONSES BY MULTIPLE AGENCIES ARE OFTEN WITHOUT COORDINATION AMONG THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH C. B. A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION ON THE GROUND AND LOCAL AGENCIES. SENATOR KABBADI OTTO POINTED OUT THE STATE'S MAJOR PARTNERS IN DISASTER RESPONSE OR THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT BUT THEY'RE ALSO OFTEN DISPARATE RESPONSES- DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT EVERY COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY AT THIS CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WORKING ON THE DROUGHT WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY STATE RESOURCES AVAILABLE BUT THE COUNTY HOW TO APPLY. AND THEN SEVERAL COUNTIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE COUNTIES DID NOT DO SO LEAVING SMALL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT RESOURCES. IT'S ALSO A GAP BETWEEN STATE ACTIONS AND THE ON THE GROUND IMPACTS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. ACCESS IS IMPAIRED TO THE LANGUAGE CULTURE INTERNET ACCESS INFORMATION AND AWARENESS TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION. THIS BILL CREATE A PASSWORD SO WE CAN GET AHEAD OF THE GAME- I WOULD HAVE STATE AGENCIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. POLICY EXPERTS AND LOCAL AGOSTO SI ASIAN. PLANT LEARN FROM PAST DISASTERS IMPLANT PROCEDURE DISASTERS THAT WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RELIEF PROGRAMS AND RELATED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS.

HONOR OF BEING INVOLVED IN HELPING TO STAND UP BERMAN THE WHAT'S NOW CALLED THE CENTRAL- CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. OUR CENTRAL COAST FARMWORKERS CENTER WHICH DEALS WITH FOR. AREAS FOR COUNTIES SO INCLUDING THE SALINAS AREA OF COURSE WHICH IS WHERE IT'S LOCATED- IN IT JUST STRIKES ME THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE THAT- THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UNITED FARM WORKERS HAVE SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMMUNICATE IN TO. HELP PEOPLE- BUT- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY WAS A DISCONNECT- EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY CONTINUED FRANKLY THROUGH THIS DAY IN TERMS OF. OF I THINK WHICH WHICH CREATED AN OUTCOME OF THIS BEING REALLY SORT OF A FORGOTTEN GROUP OF FRONTLINE WORKERS TO SOME DEGREE SO I ATE A TO APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE IN THE- YOU'VE TAKEN SOME AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THAT LONG TERM. IN AYE AYE TO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A CO AUTHOR ON THE BILL OF UP THAT'S APPROPRIATE AT SOME TIME THANK YOU. I THANK YOU CENTER CENTER COMMONER DIGITAL CENTER PLAN HELLO THANKS RICH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND WE ALSO HEARD AND HEALTH COMMITTEE HAVE APPRECIATE IT SAID JUST WRAPS ONE BRIEF QUESTION AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME MEN AND STICK IT TO THE COMPOSITION TWENTY I DO APPRECIATE THAT- AND THE AMENDMENT DID MENTION THAT THE FARMWORKERS WOULD BE ABLE AT LEAST RECEIVE SOME REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES ATTAINTED A MEETING WITH- PARTICULAR REASON FOR SENSUALLY NOT. PROVIDE YEAH BASICALLY SPECIFICALLY SAYING NOT THAT TASK MEMBERS SHOULD NOT RECEIVE A PER DIEM FOR SERVING. ON THE TASK FORCE. WELL THAT WHAT MY GOAL WAS IS TO UP NOT ENDING HAVING TO BE HELD IN APPROPRIATIONS QUITE FRANKLY OKAY ANYTIME YOU START ADDING COSTS ON TO THAT. TO THEIR MEETING- EIGHTY RUN THE RISK OF HAVING IT. THE BRAND TO RENT IT COST TOO MUCH MONEY OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT NO I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I DO THINK THAT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE TAKING TIME OFF AND IT'S PRETTY THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY AT LEAST PROVIDED FOR THE FARM WORKERS BECAUSE- SOMETIMES THE OTHER. YOUNG PEOPLE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE ON COMMITTEES WHO MADE P. L. LOW INCOME THAT WE WANNA HEAR THE VOICES AND YET WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE SERVE BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TIME THERE'S EXPENSES ASSOCIATED TENDING MEETINGS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TEN A PERSON. AND YOU'RE NOT LEAST REIMBURSING SOME OF THEM IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE SO I DID IT WAS JUST LOOK HERE IS ABOUT THAT AND GET SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS PERHAPS ARE GONNA BE OF BETTER MEANS BUT I'M NOT SURE WE CAN ALWAYS ASSUME THAT. BUT BUT OKAY THANK YOU AND IT IS THE BUILDING MOVED. HAS AN ELEMENT OF THE BILLS AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAN AND I% APPRECIATE. THAT MY MIGHT. IN IN RURAL CALIFORNIA IS THAT. I EXPECTED THAT. MOST OF THESE FARMWORKERS SERVING CBO'S HAVE FARMWORKERS AS PART OF THEIR- EITHER THEIR BORDER THERE THEIR STAFF THEY DO WORK AND- USUALLY THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT TRAVEL AND FOR PER DIEM- IT'S PART OF. HOW THEY THEY BUILD THEIR THEIR FINANCES. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT THE COMMITTEE CHECK. CALLING IT OUT AND MAKING SURE THAT FARMWORKERS. NUMBER ONE ACTUALLY DO END UP ON THE COMMITTEE. I'M NOT NOT BY HAPPENSTANCE IN NUMBER TWO THAT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES THERE TO BE ABLE TO. PAY FOR THEIR TRAVEL IN THEIR PER DIEM. I THINK THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND- AS I SAID. TRYING TO KEEP THE COSTS DOWN BUT I DO APPRECIATE IT AND THANK YOU. OKAY I. WE HAVE A MOTION AND I SENATOR COUPLE YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE.

THEIR SYNERGIES THERE IN SOME AREAS DID IT BETTER THAN OTHERS AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TAKE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND INSTITUTIONALIZE SOME SO THAT WE CAN USE THAT WE CAN PULL THEM OUT MUSEUM. WHENEVER WE HAVE A DISASTER SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO START ALL OVER EVERY TIME WE HIT THIS POINT. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU CENTER COUPLE YET- THE PROMOTION- CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB SIX THREE POPE SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST DEMAND AND RE REFER TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS HER TADO I. HURTADO I'D JONES CORTESE RIGHT CORTESE I CALL MARKER KAMLAGER I'D PAN AYE MAN AYE. AND WE WILL PLACE THAT BILL ON CALL TO ALLOW OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THANK YOU CENTER CURRICULA. SO UP NEXT WE HAVE SB SIX THREE NINE BY SENATOR DORADO. AT THE GYM THE ITEM NUMBER TEN AND I BELIEVE SHE IS JUST. ON OUR WAY SHE'S RIDE AROUND THE DOOR. SENATE DRAWS HERE WHAT WE ARE READY FOR YOU SENATOR ALSO OKAY I'M HERE. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN I EXTERNAL OKAY GREAT- SO I WANT TO THANK THE FIRST THAT THANK THE COMMITTEE OF VERY MUCH FOR THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND- FOR THE COLLABORATION SB SIX THIRTY NINE ENSURES THAT WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CANNOT BE PAID LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE STATE HAS BEEN ON THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO WHAT'S CALLED THE ISSUANCE OF FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES. UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION WITH ARGUABLY GOOD INTENTIONS WAR VETERANS WHO DEVELOPED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISABILITIES FROM COMBAT CAME HOME FROM ABROAD AND STRUGGLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT IN THE MANUFACTURING ECONOMY. SAYS WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES WERE PERCEIVED TO BE LESS EFFICIENT IN THOSE MANUFACTURING JOBS AND THEIR PEERS. CERTIFICATES ALLOWED FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN ALL OF THE WORKERS BASED ON THEIR MANUFACTURING ABILITY OVER TIME FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES OFFERED EMPLOYERS A POOL OF CHEAP LABOUR OF WORKERS WITH INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS ALSO KNOWN AS- SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. FIVE YEARS AGO THEY WERE 220-002-0030 FIVE CALIFORNIA'S WORKING IN A SUB MINIMUM WAGE ENVIRONMENT. THE LAST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FIGURE HAD DIPPED TO TWELVE THOUSAND IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY AND THE NUMBER CONTINUES TO DECLINE. THE NUMBER OF CERTIFICATE HOLDERS HAS ALSO DECREASED FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TO EIGHTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY. DESPITE THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI ACTUALLY HAVE MORE. FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATE HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE COUNTRY WITH OUR FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL BEING EXPLOITED IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS OFTEN FOR LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR. SEGREGATED EMPLOYMENT IS ANTITHETICAL TO OUR VALUES AS A STATE AND REINFORCES THE FALSE NOTION THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE UNABLE TO BE INTEGRATED IN SOCIETY AND IN CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LABOR OF VALUE. THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE OF NEW FORTY C. CERTIFICATES. BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT DEVELOPS A PHASE OUT PLAN FOR CURRENT CERTIFICATE HOLDERS TO ENSURE A PATH TO COMPETITIVE. INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS BILL WILL END THE PRACTICE OF SEGREGATED MEN UP SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT ENTIRELY. THIS IS A MEASURE TO OFFER WORKERS OFFER DIGNITY TO WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES AND PROVIDE A PATH TO ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD JOIN ALASKA CONNECTICUT. MARYLAND NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK RHODE ISLAND TEXAS AND WASHINGTON IN PROHIBITING SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT OR SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. THIS IS A RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IT DATES TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED AN EDUCATION AND BEFORE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT WHICH PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON DISABILITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL JOINING ME TODAY ARE KEN BARNES CEO OF OPTIONS FOR ALL. AND AARON- CARRUTHERS FROM THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- WILL DO A QUICK INTRO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INTRODUCED OUR PRINCIPAL WITNESS WHO IS JACKIE ARMSTRONG. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS A BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I JUST DON'T WANT THAT- ASKED IT BOB ARE YOU STOPPING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AT THIS MOMENT YES I'M SORRY YES OKAY THANK YOU RATE JUMPED OVER THAT YET. OKAY AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO JACKIE ARMSTRONG- VIA TELEPHONE. RIGHT NOW RICHARD HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. MY NAME IS JACKIE ARMSTRONG AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SB SIX THREE NINE. SO I AM JACKIE ARMSTRONG AND THIRTY FIVE I LIVE IN ROSEVILLE CALIFORNIA. AND I. I AM ON THE OPTIONS BACKGROUND. SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. I HAD A JOB AND THEN I LOST IT THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED I WAS LIVING ON MY OWN SO I. DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AT HOME WITH MY PARENTS. SO I WAS- LOOKING INTO SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AS A POSSIBILITY IF I COULD GET A JOB COACH BUT I WAS TOLD THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO GO TO A SHELTERED WORKSHOP CHAU I TOOK THAT OFF- AND I WANT TO- SHELTERED WORKSHOP. MY FIRST DAY THERE I WAS GROWING UP ON BOTH. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WORD COMING IN BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING YOU SCREWED NOT ON BOTH AND YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR THE ENTIRE DAY- WHEN WORK IS COMING IN THOUGH. WE USUALLY DID LIKE PACKAGING JOHN ASSEMBLY AND IT WAS VERY MUCH BY PRODUCTIVITY SO- HOW FAST YOU WANT HAD. EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THAT SO YOU COULD YOU KNOW GO VERY VERY FAST TO MAKE THIRTY MISTAKES AND GET PAID MORE THAN SOMEONE THAT WAS VERY METICULOUS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT- THEN I GOT PROMOTED- SO I WAS WORKING ON- FROM SWEET WHERE I PACKAGE DATES AND RAISINS AND THINGS AND THEIR WEIGHT AT THE TIME WAS ABOUT EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR AND I WAS MAKING ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THEN I GOT PROMOTED TO WORK AT A- WORK IN THE ELECTRONICS WHERE I BUILT MEDICAL DEVICES IN MY ARM. THE TASK BUT I DID- OR MUCH MORE COMPLEX BUT BECAUSE OF THE- PRODUCTS IN THE- THAT WAS IN PLACE. I ACTUALLY GOT PAID GLAD BECAUSE OF HOW METICULOUS AND CAREFUL I WAS BEING OUT THE JOB SO I GOT A PROMOTION BUT I GOT DOCTOR A FIFTY CENT- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE ASPECT OF- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS BEING UTILIZED- SO MY CAPABILITY INFORM MY- AND I DIDN'T FEEL I WAS GROWING MUCH I LOVE HER. IN FACT I WOULD ACTUALLYBEING BULLIED QUITE A BIT FROM PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES AND I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY SMALL AND YOU KNOW GOT TO A POINT WHERE ANYBODY THAT WAS HER TYPICAL THAT WASN'T MY FAMILY OR MY APARTMENT STAFF JIMMY WAS THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE OF HOW BADLY I WAS BEING. WHEN I WAS OUT THERE SHELTERED WORKSHOP- I BELIEVE- IS STRONGLY ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DESERVES THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE SAME CHOICES- AS EVERYBODY ELSE BUT THE FIRST CHOICE OF THE ENTRY SHOULD NOT BE GO TO THE SHELTER WORKSHOP THAT YOU'RE ONLY THAT'S YOUR ONLY CHOICE TO WORK IT SHOULD BE WHERE DO YOU WANT TO WORK LIKE YOU WANT TO WORK AT RANGE YOU WANT TO WORK IN AN OFFICE YOU KNOW IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE SHELTERED WORKSHOP. OR NOTHING- AND- THEY- WE DESERVE TO BE PAID. THE SAME WAY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DIES. AND SO I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT- WITH MY REMAINING TIME SO NOW I DO NOT WORK INITIAL WORKSHOP ANYMORE I ACTUALLY WORK AT THE- SACRAMENTO UTILITY DISTRICT- SMOG AND I MAKE A LOT MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE MY COWORKERS ARE WONDERFUL I DON'T GET BULLIED AT ALL AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE BEHIND THEIR- THANK YOU AND I.

OUR COMPANY HEALTH SEVERAL BUSINESSES MANAGE FOURTEEN C. SUB MINIMUM WAGE CERTIFICATES AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS SEE THESE JOBS AS VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. BUT WHILE I AM NEW TO THIS INDUSTRY- MY TWIN BROTHER LIVED WITH CEREBRAL PALSY SO I CAN APPRECIATE THE GENUINE LOVE. M. A. EMOTION CONNECTED TO THIS ISSUE- WHAT I DISCOVERED AFTER BECOMING CEO IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY IS THAT FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES OFTEN TOOLS FOR EMPLOYERS. TO LEGALLY EXPLOIT THE LABOR OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO I BANDAR SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES. FIND THE MARKET RATE JOBS IT'S NOT EASYBUT WITH DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK ON BEHALF OF THOSE WE SERVE WE CAN TRANSITION PEOPLE TOO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IN FACT. SINCE WE PANNED FOURTEEN C. SUPPORTS LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PLACE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PEOPLE INTO MARKET RATE JOBS AND THAT'S DURING A PANDEMIC. HOW DO WE DO THAT INSTEAD OF BACKING EMPLOYERS TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE TELL POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A-PHENOMENAL EMPLOYEE. AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT- IN CLOSING I'LL SEE THIS OF MY AREA STUDY IN COLLEGE WHAT WAS HUMAN RIGHTS ANNABEL STUDENT ONCE ASKED HER PROFESSOR HOW DO YOU DEFINE A HUMAN RIGHTS AND HIS RESPONSE WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. HIS RESPONSE WAS I KNOW WHEN I SEE IT AS THE SOUP LAST YEAR WHEN I HAD LEARNED THAT IS LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PESO ONE THREE FOUR FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR.

THE MANAGER MEMBERS ACROSS LONDON HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES TO STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM SERVING THIS POPULATION WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. SB SIX THIRTY NINE PROPOSALS TO CLOSE ALL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF AB DE WHO WORK UNDER A LEGAL FOURTEEN C. ARRANGEMENT. WITHOUT ANY FUTURE PLANNED FOR FUNDING SCHEME. THAT'S PRESENTS A DIRECT CONFLICT WE BELIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TENANT OF THE LANHAM ACT ITSELF. DATA PEOPLE WITH IBD CHOOSING A PATH FOR HOW THEY BEST SEE THE LIGHTS GOING INCLUDING GIVING A JOB OF THEIR CHOICE MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THAT FROM THEM WITH NO SOLUTION IN PLACE SECOND. ELIMINATION OF FOURTEEN C. IN CALIFORNIA COMES WITH NO DATA THAT ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL WORK FOR THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ON FOURTEEN SHE PROGRAMS TODAY. STILL TRACKS PEOPLE IN FOURTEEN HE PROGRAMS AS ARE CLOSED BUT IT DOES NOTHING OF VALUE IN CURRENT PRACTICES OF TODAY TOUTED BY THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WHICH HAVE NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH REALISTIC ALTERNATIVES TODAY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU ARE NOW BEING OUT TO LEGISLATE. SENATOR ALSO COMPARES THE U. S. IT COMPARES CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES ARE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE WORKING EASIER 86% THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 86% WELL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THIRD WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS WHERE THE CONTRACTED WORKERS BROUGHT INTO A TEAM OF PEOPLE OF IDT TO COMPLETE ARE THE CHEAPEST THING THE STATE FUNDS AT ABOUT THIRTY BUCKS PER DAY PER PERSON. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT MUCH OF THE WORK IN MEANS THE pCLOSED THE STATE WILL ACCORDING THE AUTHOR'S OWN WORDS MEAN AT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE TO TRANSITION. TO MORE EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVES. AND COSTS UP TO COST TO THE HUNDREDS FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE ACCORDING ITS OWN. FIND INTERESTING PROGRAM AT LEVEL. WE STRONGLY URGE THAT YOU ELIMINATE THE TERMINATION DATE FOR THESE PROGRAMS WHILE STILL PUSHING FORWARD. THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DEVELOP A PLAN. AND WE ALSO URGE YOU ASK PROPONENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT MORE FULLY. THEIR EXISTING DATA SO WE CAN ASSESS WITH THESE PROGRAMS CAN WORK AT THE SCALE THEY'RE ASKING THREE DONE. BY MILLER. WE TALKED FOR YEARS TO SEE WHAT THEY NEED. TO JOIN US AND HELP US FINDING EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE IBD WE ARE THE NO VOTE AT THIS POINT HONESTLY SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CARL- DO WE HAVE GIAMBOLOGNA LINE. RIGHT MEDICARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS JOHN BLAME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR VISIBILITY ON THE CONTACT OUT THERE HE- I WOULD HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE TROUT CONTRA COSTA COUNTY A WIDE ARRAY OF SERVICES INCLUDING. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WHO ARE A RANDOM POINTED SERVICES FROM CA JOB COACHING TO WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS. AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. GRADES AREN'T GOING TO SERVICES MIX OF THE SPECTRUM BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING AS SUCH IT'S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHY CLOSER STILL. HURRIED TO THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH ASK WHAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IT'S PARTY SIMPLISTIC CAPTURE ALL OF THE NEW CHALLENGES. EACH INDIVIDUAL FATE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THERE ARE VAST DIFFERENCES IN BOTH THE MANNER AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE ENACTED BY THE DISABILITY. IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE SUCH A BROAD SET OF INDIVIDUALS. WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE MUST BE AS EQUALLY ROBUST. VISIBILITY WE OFFER A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE EMPLOYMENT GOALS. BUT JUST AS MANY PEOPLE IN. ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT AS WE DO ONE OF FOURTEEN STATE. WE DO NOT FEEL ANY OF THE PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT SUBSTITUTE. ONE ANOTHER RATHER THEIR COMPLEMENT THAT ENABLE US TO SERVE ABOUT THREE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS AND I THINK ABOUT THREE OR THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND THE DATE. FORTY THREE IS THE ONLY PROVEN MECHANISM FOR HELPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE HIGHEST AREAS. ANY MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT IF THEY EMPLOY. OTHER LEGISLATION SUCH AS WE OUR AND CALIFORNIA BLUEGRASS HAS DIMINISHED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORKING UNDER FOURTEEN FEET AS MENTIONED EARLIER. DIMINISH THOSE THAT NUMBER DOWN TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO. TRULY NEED SUCH A SUPPORT. WE SHOULD NOT AND CAN HIDE BEHIND BOTH. ALL PEOPLE WORKING UNDER FOURTEEN FEET TODAY OR EVEN A FRACTION OF THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER THE MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT. WITH THE CURRENT RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE. SO I HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY THIS BILL USED PRIME OF THE MILESTONE MARKER FOR DISMANTLING FOURTEEN FEET. OFFERS NOTHING MORE THAN THE POTENTIAL OF A PLAN OR ITS REPLACEMENT. WHAT IF SOMEBODY SAID THAT WE SHOULD PASS A LAW THAT. THAT DISMANTLE YOUR JOB IN A FEW YEARS BUT NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO ARE PLANNING. FOR WHAT YOU GET TO DO WITH YOUR OWN FUTURE. WHAT WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT. THE BILL COULD YOU HAVE BEEN WRITTEN THE STATE OUTCOMES PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY WORK UNDER FORTY FEET AS THOUGH SAID MILESTONE MARKERS. IT COULD HAVE ALSO BEEN WRITTEN WITH CERTAIN FAILED STATES. PEOPLE SUCH AS STATE PROVIDING FUNDING GAP THE WAIT BETWEEN THE FOURTEENTH THE WAGE AND THE MINIMUM WAGE. AGAIN WITH SUCH EASY WAYS TO MOVE THIS THING FORWARD. IT DOES NOT HARM PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF. WHY HI THE PROPOSED AT THE MAZDA MARKER TO DISMANTLE FORTY THREE. HI NOT SAYING THE FOURTEENTH PERFECT OR AT LEAST NOT TRY REPLACE FOURTEEN SOMETHING BETTER. THE CARD. I'M ACCORDING TO BILL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROPOSED REPLACE FOURTEEN HE WAS BETTER. THE PROPOSAL IS TO REPLACE FORTY THREE WITH A PLANT. NOW CLOSED TODAY BY STATE THIS BILL HELLO HARM TO SOME OF OUR VULNERABLE. ARGUE WILL WE IT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES HAVING THEIR VOICES HEARD. GIVEN THE STATE OF THE PANDEMIC THEIR INABILITY TO SELF ADVOCATE SIGNIFICANTLY COMPOUND IT. THEY HAVE DIMINISH THE COURTS TO ASSIST THEM AND HAVING A VOICE IS HEARD. SO TO PUT FOR THE BILL. WE TARGET THESE INDIVIDUALS DURING A TIME WHEN THEY FACE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AND SPEAKING UP. IN MY OPINION ATROCIOUS AND YOU GIVE ANYONE MORE THAN ENOUGH CAUSE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL MOVING ANY MOVIE ANY FOR THAT ALREADY. THANK YOU GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE I. THANK YOU- THIS CALL WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION. ON THIS MEASURE WILL BEGIN- HERE FORTY TWO OH THREE. THREE NINE- MOVING ON TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SANDERS WHILE A MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE TELEPHONE LINE FOR THOSE WAITING TO STATE THEIR OPPOSITION. TO SB SIX THREE NINE- JUST WANTED TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT IT THIS IS NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. ON THE MEASURE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIX THREE NINE THE NEW PRESS ONE THEN THERE AT THIS TIME. AND WE GOT OUR FIRST LINE. FOR SIXTEEN. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU ARE MELISSA CORTEZ REPRESENTING AUTISM SPEAKS WE SUBMITTED A LETTER OF CONCERN WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A PLAN IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE PHASE OUT. THANK YOU. MEXICO TO LINE FOR FIFTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VERY JOURNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SERVICES ASSOCIATION YOU DON'T HAVE A FORMAL OPPOSITION MISSED ON THIS BILL- RATHER WE HAVE CONCERNS AROUND THE TIMELINE THE LOCK BOX ARE DEAD AND MICHAEL FUNDING IDENTIFIED HIMSELF THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. MEXICO TO LINE FOR FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS TRACY HOW INTERNET FAMILY MEMBER OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND I AM IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. AND THEN AT THE TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR AT THIS MOMENT I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A COMMENT ON THIS MEASURE AND ALL I'D LIKE TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HER COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING. THE CONCERNS RAISED BY AT THIS COMMITTEE. I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT WE ALL WANT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY IN EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES. INCLUDING IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT. ARE CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM THAT SERVES PEOPLE WITH. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS COMPLEX. AND IT IS IT IS INVOLVING TO REFLECT ON OUR MODERN VIEW THE PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CAN EXPERIENCE LIFE TO THE FULLEST. WITH FULFILLING COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND REWARDING JOBS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS VISION CAN BE REALIZED WITH THE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AS LONG AS WE PROCEED WITH CAUTION- THE QUESTION OF THE DAY IS HOW BEST TO TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS OUT OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT ANYWAY. AND ON THE TIMELINE THAT ALLOWS THE SYSTEM TO CREATE APPROPRIATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO WOULD BE LEAVING THEIR JOBS- AS AS YOU HEARD TODAY THERE CONTINUES TO BE QUESTIONS ON THE ON THE MOST APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THIS TRANSITION- ARE YOU I WILL CONTINUE MONITORING THIS BILL. AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND REMAIN VESTED IN THE AND THE OUTCOME. AND IT YOU KNOW TO I ALSO WANT TO JUST REMINDED HER BUT IT MADE THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY IS ABOUT- AT. ONE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE FOCUS AND REMEMBER THEM AND BE CONCENTRATED ON ON COMING YOU KNOW. COMING OUT WITH THE BEST SOLUTION POSSIBLE. AND I JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT AND BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THAT DONE IF WE REMAIN. ALL SIDES REMAIN FOCUSED ON THAT SO AT THIS MOMENT I'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN. IT UP TO COME INTO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER COME UNDER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM CHARGES WANNA COME IN THE ON. FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW AS I STATED BEFORE I AM THE STEP PARENT OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM AND I HAVE. BEEN IN THE ROOM WHEN FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT. HOW THEY'RE BEING PAID- AND WHAT THEY'RE WORTH AREAS- AND WHEN YOU DEVALUE A BODY OR A BEING. AND YOU DON'T PAY THEM WITH DIGNITY.

ACT A TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH AS WE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS TAY'S- TA WHY STUDY AFTER STUDY INDICATES OF. THE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN NEARLY EVERY FACET OF LIFE WHEN COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION THE MORE I COULD HAVE UNFAVORABLE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CONTACT WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WILL RATES OF SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. TO NO SURPRISE THE STRUGGLES THEY'VE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY COOK BY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ACCORDING TO A MAY TWENTY TWENTY POLL OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOSTER CARE NEARLY FOSTER JOBS. MORE THAN HALF 53% DID NOT RECEIVE A STIMULUS CHECK. NEARLY ONE IN FIVE HAVE RUN OUT OF FOOD AND ALMOST A QUARTER 23% BUT WE ARE AT RISK OR WERE AT THAT TIME OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING. WHEN FOSTER YOUTH REACH AGE TWENTY ONE. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESOURCES THEY RELY ON TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS ARE PROBABLY CUT OFF. LEAVING THEM TO NAVIGATE ADULTHOOD WITH LITTLE OR NO SUPPORT. AS A RESULT ONE FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AFTER LEAVING THE EXTENT OF FOSTER YOUR FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. ONE IN FOUR. HOMELESS AS THE CHILDREN OF OUR STATE FOSTER YOUTH ARE NOT ONLY WORTHY OF INVESTMENT BUT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO INVEST IN THESE YOUTH AND SUPPORT THEM AND FIND A STABLE PATH TO SUCCESS AFTER EXISTS EXITING THE SYSTEM. SB pSTATEWIDE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME PILOT. FOR YOUTH AGING OUT OF EXTENDED FOSTER CARE THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WITH DIRECT UNCONDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS BUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR THREE YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WILL BE TASKED WITH ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM AND CONDUCT AN EVALUATION UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM. THIS PROPOSAL CLOSELY MIRRORS A SANTA CLARA COUNTY UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME PILOT PROGRAM. WHICH IS CURRENTLY SERVING SEVENTY TWO FORMER FOSTER YOUH. FOR THE PROGRAM IS STILL ON GOING INTO EFFECTIVENESS IS STILL BEING MEASURED EARLY FEEDBACK SUGGESTS THAT THE PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED INCREASED ABILITY FOR RECIPIENTS DURING TIMES OF SUCH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. MORE MORE MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS COUNTRY YOU'RE CONSIDERING OR ALREADY IMPLEMENTING A BASIC INCOME PILOT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH RECEIVING GUARANTEED INCOME. THE CITY OF STOCKTON. IS ONE MUNICIPALITY THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED A BASIC INCOME PILOT PROGRAM. IN THE FINAL REPORT INDICATES THAT RECIPIENTS EXPERIENCE IMPROVED HEALTH AND HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING FULLY EMPLOYED UPON CONCLUSION OF THE PROGRAM AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. AS A COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC WORSENS. INEQUITIES AMONG OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON FLEXIBLE. COST EFFICIENT APPROACHES. LIKE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME WHICH CAN LIFT INDIVIDUALS. OUT OF POVERTY AND SET THE MOMENT THE LAW TO STABILITY.

AND AS FORMER SUPERVISOR NOW SENATOR CORTEZ B. HAS SHARED WITH YOU HIS LEADERSHIP HELPED US TO LAUNCH THE PILOT DURING NOT ONLY A MORE VULNERABLE TIME IN THEIR LIVES BUT MISSED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND I'VE MET WITH OUR PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR RACIAL YOUNG ADULTS. THEY HAVE SHARED WITH US SOME OF THEIR DAILY STRESSORS WHICH JUST REINFORCES HOW PRECARIOUS THE STAGE IN OUR LIVES ARE AND THEY STRUGGLE TO TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD AND ARE ALSO AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE SERVICES WITHOUT PARENTS OR FAMILY TO RELY ON. AS A GUARANTEED PAYMENT STARTED TO REACH OUR PARTICIPANTS WE NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN OUR MINDSET THE NATIONALLY WHEN WE FIRST REACHED OUT TO THEM THEY HAD DESTRUCT AND ANXIETY AROUND JOINING A CUTLET WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY.

PILOT HAS TRULY BEEN A LIFELINE DURING THEIR TIME OF GREATEST NEED RATHER THAN THE MOORING ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO EAT. THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
