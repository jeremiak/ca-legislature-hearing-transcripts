these issues. Must also

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.732
acknowledge that many

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:29.569
challenges persist after years

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.738
of systemic marginal Asian.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.706
We've got your- thing and

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.742

bill isn't in France

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.746
foundation. For the realization

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:43.683
of our values of academic

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.391
excellence it accepts. However.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:51.991
On staff to divert every sort

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.726
cannot be fully realized when

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.327
individuals are marginalized

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.528
due to their origins outlook

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:56.095
store orientations it's our

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:56.696
responsibility to prepare our

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:57.764
students to fully engage in a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.532
world defined by difference and

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.768
diversity and to provide a safe

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:05.605
and welcoming community for all.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.105
Last year we launched a

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.607
comprehensive undergraduate

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.742
student diversity project at

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.844
Berkeley. The projects goal was

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.680
to provide the analysis

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.548
necessary both to expand

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.684
diversity within the student

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.585
body and to improve the campus

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.854
experience for those groups and

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.623
communities that have

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.123
historically been under

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.958
represented or marginalized in

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:29.262
higher education. The effort

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:29.662
yielded a set of

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.831
recommendations the challenge

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.633
us to reexamine arm to just to

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.535
young people and their families

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.737
and communities as well as our

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.505
overall intentions process sees

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:43.509
alignment and culture. The

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.143
recommendations also make it

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.712
clear that we must strive for

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:49.549
equity of experience for every

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.651
student our campus. Builder

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.453
torture of belonging and

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.722
identify ways to highlight

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.757
those from under represented

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.492
and marginalized groups as

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.661
contributors and co

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.362
constructors of our university.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.565
These efforts which price per

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.266

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.535
about in more detail. Are

or something that intervenes

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.579
and prevents us for coming so

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.515

campus sexual assault and

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.559
violence to hunger and

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.092
homelessness among college

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.594
students. And we have a lot

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.729
more to explore. This committee

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.498
has authored numerous pieces of

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.733
legislation that have passed

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.301
and have made a difference

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.669
across the campus is

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.504
particularly. In the area of

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:52.004
homelessness and food in

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.408
securities. Higher education

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:57.443
for many of our young people

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.077
learn and examine the world in

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.846
which we it happen. In the near

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.514
future students from the UCC

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.382
issues in the community

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:03.983
colleges will be setting the

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.751
climate. Not only for their

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.520
campuses but for the entire

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.589
state of California. It was

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.490
interesting when we began this-

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.759
this this- committee this

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.428
hearing the select committee. I

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.630
was asked to chair the

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.498
committee because- at the time

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.500
of those are speaker Mister pet

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.669
issues now the chair of the

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:27.640
regions- we had an incident at

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.542
San Jose state. And we he was

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.677
greatly concerned that we did

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.245
not have proper response to

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.913
instead. He looked around and

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.781
he decided that I would. Yeah

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.783
he called me actually doing one

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.685
of a to the holiday break. And

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.554
asked me to chair of this

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.389
committee of the select

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.458
committee and he said because

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:45.958
he looked around and he

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:46.459
realized that of all the

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:47.827
members on the assembly. And

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.729
the Senate that I was one we

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.464
have the longest record in

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.098
higher education having been a

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.699
professor at San Diego state

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.701
forty years. And a chair of a

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.637
department on and off of

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.237
probably thirty years that I

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.505
can understood the campus

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.607
climate the campus community.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:02.141
And could probably pull

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.910
together some things that were

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:05.444
important in addressing it. Of

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:09.682
the legislature in I'd not only

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:10.249
see that this is not just a

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.751
discussion of the day. But in

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.686
investment in tomorrow. When we

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.421
first began this someone said

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:16.055
well the problem reason we were

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.924
having at at that particular

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.659
time was because- students come

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.661
from so many places across the

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.629
state. And they meet at our

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.263
university campuses and so it

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.998
almost looks like so therefore

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.633
the campus climate keeps

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.134
changing because of the

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.568
students that of the year. My

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.637
response was that our campuses

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.439
are not. Just are not

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.374
thermostats I mean they're not

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:35.975
the monitors they don't just

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.743
measure the climate they

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.845
determine the climate we have

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:40.446
thermostats. And we gonna so

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:41.681
where students come from we

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.016
have to have a set of standards

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.751
that we- expect for every

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.954
student on this campus at the

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.555
parents who send their children

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.524
to us. Should expect a campus

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.091
that we control. That will

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.859
provide safe. And welcoming

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.728
experiences for every student

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.997
regardless of where they came

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.699
from. And so we're not here

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:00.199
just to measure what's

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.934
happening we're here to talk

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.436
about how do we determine. The

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.003
kind of the environment and

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.771
spirit that needs to be on

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.840
every campus- as we continue to

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:11.444
grow. As a system- would be a

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.944
become then will become

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.646
increasingly diverse. I student

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.815
needs. To feel safe when I

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.416
campus and knowledgeable about

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.552
campus procedures policies and

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.988
services. This select committee

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.589
as I said was formed in

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:27.493
nineteen in twenty fourteen.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.094
Because of what was happening

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.929
at San Jose. In that could have

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.530
happened on any campus at that

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.098
particular time. And that it

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.332
was not fostering and building

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.301
a positive campus climate.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.403
Unfortunately symbols of hate

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.472
offensive hate speech in acts

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.307
of intimidation have continued

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.476
to be on a steady incline in

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.578
the last four years. According

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:46.178
to the data released by the

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:47.646
anti defamation league. There

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:51.450
has been a 77% increase across

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.319
the nation of white supremacist

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:53.886
propaganda distribution on

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.523
college campuses. For twenty

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.124
eighteen nineteen the academic

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.725
year California have the most

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.727
incidents with fifty eight

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.696
incidents of extremist

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.598
propaganda. Followed by

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.666
Kentucky with twenty two in

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.335
Oklahoma with nineteen. I think

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:09.869
that shocks most. Because

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:10.403
normally people think of

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:11.771
California. As this place of

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:15.708
tremendous diversity liberal

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.476
thinking of people working

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:18.044
together because that's the

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.478
image that we have. But as we

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:21.680
have begun to delve deeper into

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.749
the activities that happen in

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.618
California- we realize that

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:26.152
this is a place that has

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:29.488
tremendous issues of race. And

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.624
gender- and religion across the

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.726
board in terms of division

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:34.326
that's the year. Some of you

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.661
are familiar with AB three nine

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.730
to our rates are bill dealing

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:41.333
with police up- use of force

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.967
and one of the driving forces

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.936
was a California has the

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:47.540
highest number. Of deaths of

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:49.809
done by police are still on

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.577
armed individuals in the nation

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.579
that was shocking to. Because

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.146
we- think that it's an out

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.848
family or Mississippi but it

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.450
was in California. And so

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:59.385
there's some things California

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:03.522
to come and grapple with and we

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:07.593
have the leaders. Taking the

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.227
charge of changing the elements

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:13.799
that it. The again the math is

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.601
right. White premises language

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:16.235
to explicitly racist images and

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:17.770
will. Often include a

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:18.270
recruitment element and

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:19.605
frequently expects minority

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:20.139
including people Muslims

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:20.773
nonwhite immigrants in the LGBT

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.074
community. Oftentimes college

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:22.641
campuses in their community

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:23.576
should be places for learning

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.511
and growing and the future and

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.613
not close minded racism and

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.214
hate Phil rhetoric from the

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.849
past. But races incidents are

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.617
not limited to the all right

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.719
segment we continue to see lack

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.654
of cultural competency within

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:36.188
our general campus cult

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:39.492
culture. Nooses students in

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.594
black face and this table

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.161
called cultural appropriate

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.564
appropriations a continue to be

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.198
seen frequently throughout our

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.668
California campuses- I'm not a

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.871
big football fan but last night

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.672
I once again saw the black cat.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:57.409
Run across the feel during the-

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.612
I guess it was the Dallas

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.847
Cowboys game and some people

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:02.515
all that's not important but it

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:03.549
reached back of. Jackie

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.818
Robinson in the nineteen

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:09.488
forties when they put a black

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:10.089
cat on the baseball field to

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:13.526
intimidate him- and for people

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:15.528
may not see it happens once

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.496
again the thinking of those who

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:25.471
would do such an act. That is

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:26.005
the episode reminds us of

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:31.577
something never. Seem to dial.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.779
Up we see this by this incident

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.781
and at some. Of the new series

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.449
the distasteful a black face

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:38.083
the culture appropriate in an

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.717
activities that occur. We see

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:39.185
the response of these

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:39.885
appropriate incidents as just

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:40.519
as important as the work being

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:41.153
done to prevent these incidents

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.921
from occurring. The leadership

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:42.521
of our institutions of higher

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.088
learning and their diversity

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:43.756
composition is also critical to

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.824
the progress of campus climate.

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.726
I know we could not completely

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:48.260
solve all campus climate

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.662
incidents the wealth

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.664
California. But we can surely

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.332
work to lower the frequency of

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:53.933
the numbers of these campus

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.701
climate incidents and we surely

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.336
can raise our level of

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.338
intolerance. It is our hope

00:13:59.405 --> 00:13:59.905
that these hearings provide

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.574
greater insight to discover

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.642
what's working what's not how

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:05.544
we can improve and if possible

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:06.178
implement and standardize some

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:09.481
of the best practices. I want

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.650
to say up front that this is

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:12.251
not a meeting this nine two

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.686
lamb passed any particular

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:17.356
campus law of that's that's in

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:17.823
the state. However the

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.961
objective. Of this hearing is

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:22.595
to disclose what's occurring on

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.731
campus. Campus how these

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.733
incidents are being handle and

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.334
to find solutions to improve

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:28.968
outcomes. Simply because we're

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:29.835
here at Berkeley doesn't mean

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:30.469
Berkeley has more problems than

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.270
UC San Diego I can tell you it

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.239
doesn't- but we're here because

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:33.839
we want to make the hearings

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.708
acceptable to people throughout

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.776
the state. And to hear from all

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:39.378
the various campuses as to what

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.012
they're doing to address these

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:43.415
issues- today as a chance to

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:45.517
learn about the work being done

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:46.051
naturally around campus

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:47.353
climate. Here from student

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:47.820
voices and explore how

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.655
California's higher education

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.657
segments are responding to and

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.926
combating the rise of hate. We

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:55.828

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.830

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.634
the progress they've made one

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.268

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:02.801
And committees formulated

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:05.471
policy recommendations from

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:06.138

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.844
at this time I want to give an

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.545

chancellor for- for being here

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.750
you know- I started Weber

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.419
described we've seen an

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.019
increase in white supremacist

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.521
propaganda. We've seen an

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:57.589
increase in hate crimes across

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.391
this country you look at-

00:15:59.458 --> 00:15:59.958
information from the anti

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:01.627
defamation league to the

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.529
Southern Poverty Law Center to

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.531
the ACLU organizations that are

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.366
dedicated to tracking and

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:09.435
combating the stuff and- now

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.537
more than ever any this

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:12.137
conversation. You know we've

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:15.441
seen this increase and frankly.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:15.974
Our races president gives

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:17.676
license to it. You know and so

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.478
that makes it incumbent upon

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.580
the rest of us at all levels of

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.181
government in this state and

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.582
across this country and those

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.718
of you in this room to actively

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.886
call it out. And push back on

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.722
it and take action on this it's

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.523
I think were in a really

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.525
critical moment right now in

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:34.126
our nation's history. On this

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.694
issue in particular. Ought to

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:39.264
this right and- what these

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.333
types of visits is due- but

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.769
it's- more important now than

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.571
ever and so how do we address

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.506
it. You know it's- up shining a

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.173
spotlight on it it's a having

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.908
public forms it's having the

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.744
dialogue around it. And then

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.445
it's about taking action and

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.079
what we're really talking about

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:55.681
here is someone comfortable

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.850
truth. That we really need to

00:16:57.916 --> 00:16:59.385
look in the mirror as society.

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.487
And talk about these

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:02.121
uncomfortable truths and I will

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.789
say. And there's no one more

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.524
better equipped in the state

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.793
legislature. To drive the

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.193
conversation about

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.628
uncomfortable truths. The

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.195
doctor show it was Shirley

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:11.830
Weber. And you know I've been

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.599
in the legislature for a year

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:14.166
now and we have some great

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.601
colleagues there some very

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.636
smart people. Who work

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.505
incredibly hard- but watching

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.540
hurt navigate. The bill around

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:25.344
police use of force- it was

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.846
pretty amazing and that was

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:31.583
about on. Double truths. We

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.117
give Shirley Weber around

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:37.489
applause for that. And so

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.658
you're all good hands here with

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:40.125
her leadership on the

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.627
conversation but I also want to

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.862
say- what's also critical as

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:45.597
your voice. And that's why I

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.533
think these former so important

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:48.133
to do across the state your

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.501
voice in this conversation is

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.370
very very important we have to

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.439
bring together all stakeholders

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:54.039
if we really want to address

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.641
this is it so that includes you

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.443

deserves. A safe learning

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.713
environment. And we can stop of

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.451
nothing short than that. So

00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:06.118

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.753

The USA race in equity center

was established in twenty

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:26.298
seventeen at the university of

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.733
southern California. Primarily

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:28.233
is an interdisciplinary

for the end of racial justice.

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:37.976
Center strength primarily lies

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.845
in its interdisciplinary which

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:41.680
brings together scholars and

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.247

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.030
sources the first the U. S.

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:32.564
census American community

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.901
survey. And secondly the US

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.402
department educations

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:37.903
integrated postsecondary

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.640
education data system. Using

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:42.107
these data the report

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:42.641
specifically assessed for

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.575
indicators racial

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.544
representation inter racial

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:49.481
gender equity completion equity

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:50.082
and black students to faculty

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:51.750
ratios. My representation

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.819
equity we were talking about-

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.754
determining the calculation of

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.756
difference between the percent

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:58.357
of black undergraduates at a

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.858
specific institution and the

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.526
percent of college age like

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.462
residents within the state.

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:04.129
With regard to gender equity we

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.631
were determining- through the

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:06.198
measures of enrollment gaps

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:07.866
between black undergraduate men

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.334
in black undergraduate women

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:09.835
relative to the overall

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.837
enrollment gaps of all women in

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:15.774
all men across racial and

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:16.408
ethnic groups. And institutions

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:17.542
with any particular state. With

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.143
about to completion accordion

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.711
we assess the differences

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.213
between the average six year

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.615
graduation rates for cohorts of

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:25.350
black undergraduate students

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:25.751
and for cohorts of

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.586
undergraduate students overall.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.521
And for black students to

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.456
faculty ratios we determined-

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:32.090
the number of full time degree

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.725
seeking black undergraduates to

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:34.326
full time black instructional

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:37.429
faculty. Letter grades were

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:37.963
then calculated for each

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.498
indicator using a Quintel

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.767
distribution and what's the top

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.435
20% received a grade of a- the

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:44.069
remaining letter grades within

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.671
distributed evenly enforce and

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:47.773
20% increments. In addition to

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.675
warding letter grades for the

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:50.208
for equity indicators we

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:51.877
calculated an equity index

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.745
score for each institution that

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:54.346
was the equivalent of a grade

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:57.649
point average. And so it's

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:58.250
customary in the same fashion

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:58.717
we do here because in

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:01.420
universities. Encountering GPAs

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.588
we assign four points for in a

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.424
three for a bi to for a C. and

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.024
one for a day. Then averages

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:07.859
some of those indicator grades

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:11.363
to determine the index score.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.930
In in to determine the state

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:12.564
and that's where we average the

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:13.799
sum of all institutional index

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.366
scores within a given state

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:17.402
calculated. The average equity

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:18.070
index score across all the five

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:18.704
hundred six public institutions

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.573
was two point zero two. No

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.140
campus aren't above a three

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.809
point five. And two hundred

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:25.744
housing overseas earned scores

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.679
below two point zero. And

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.648
institutional level you see San

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:31.850
Diego cal state Monterey Bay

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.685
cal state Fresno and UC

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:34.252
riverside were all located

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.654
amongst the top thirty five

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.422
individual institutions

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:38.023
nationally. With index for the

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.426
three point oh or better. The

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:43.762
state of California receiving

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.564
the next work two point four

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.131
six ranking it third amongst

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.365
all states in the nation.

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.935
However it to be sure such

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:51.470
ratings and rankings are wholly

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.104
contextual in relation to all

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.805
institutions assess. Disturbing

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:55.907
grades in quintiles Evelyn

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.943
required us to provide Asian

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.444
bees to some institutions that

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.513
actually performed poorly.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.648
Relatively not as bad as the

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:04.182
remaining three fifths of

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:05.383
institutions in the whole study.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.486
Differently our calculations as

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.019
he would say and students

00:23:08.086 --> 00:23:08.620
sometimes appreciate is graded

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.790
on a curve. It's going grading

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.992
on a curve we attempted to make

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.427
clear that scores not

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:16.061
necessarily reflect or indicate

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:19.498
blacks in equity. For example

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.132
while the score two point four

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:21.967
six ranks California most the

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:22.534
highest performing in our

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:25.504
study. It's a reflects a C.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.171
average black student equity in

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:26.738
their forty man significan

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:28.306
improves the made especially at

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:31.777
the remaining twenty seven

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:32.377
institutions. It's going below

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.278
two point seven five.

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:33.845
Additionally in a separate

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.714
report published by the center

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:36.348
that examine racial inequities

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:37.816
among black male student

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:38.350
athletes and see double a

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.618
division one power five

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.753
conferences. Which cal Berkeley

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.387
UCLA. And USC and Stanford were

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:45.657
included. What the report

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.692
evidence is that there

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:48.326
disparities in graduation rates

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:51.363
months black student athletes

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:51.997
which were abysmally low in all

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.665
cases except for Stanford.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.567
Which were objectively high. I

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:57.235
find this particular important

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:57.869
to notice California recently

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.504
led the nation in deciding to

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.506
allow athletes to earn income

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:02.040
off of their likeness to

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.475
endorsements which is most

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:04.042
relevant to those in revenue

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.644
generating sports such as

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.512
football and men's basketball

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.013
what's the overwhelming

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:08.647
majority are comprised of black

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:11.516
men. It's to evidence in a

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:12.117
report. In which definition

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:13.618
institutions and roll black

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:15.654
male. Students at a rate equal

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.589
to or less than 3% of all

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:18.123
students. Well black men

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.593
comprise. Between thirty and

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.093
56% of the football and

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.595
basketball teams. In this is

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.864
reported by both said he's only

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.799
measure specific quantifiable

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:29.501
outcomes with which each report

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.636
was concerned. And although

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:33.371
they may reflect in some way.

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:33.972
The environment within which

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:34.606
black students live work and

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:35.574
learn the do not

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.442
comprehensively assess factors

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.076
most commonly associated with

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.511
campus racial climate. And

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.011
therefore for their in

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.913
different assessments are

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.415
essential to understanding the

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:44.049
relation between post secondary

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:45.951
environments their social

00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:47.953
context is to experiences and

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:48.520
for this reason the center

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.855
together. With a panel of more

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.656
than fifty nationally

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:52.257
recognized experts on campus

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.892
racism survey methodologies and

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.627
college students develop the

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:56.194
national assessment for Klay

00:24:56.261 --> 00:25:03.602
just campus climates. Unlike

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:05.604
other assessments the neck

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.606
takes intentionally narrow

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:08.206
approach to isolate racism of

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.407
the phenomena under study.

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.443
Based on our previous centers

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:11.977
decade of work on campus

00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.478
climate we learn that broader

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:14.112
recesses often fail to provide

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.747
the necessary death to dress in

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:16.248
one of the nation's most

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:19.451
intractable problems. What is

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.519
more racism routinely is pushed

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:22.153
further into the margins by and

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.755
areas subsumed under the

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.857
contested and under specified

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:26.424
banner of diversity equity

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:27.859
inclusion. In the wake of the

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.427
rising tide of white supremacy

00:25:29.494 --> 00:25:30.061
on college university campuses

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:31.930
and elsewhere within broader

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:32.430
society. We thought it

00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:33.632
important to restrict our

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:35.467
assessment to the deep study of

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.636
race and racism. The survey

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:39.638
administered to all students

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.071
within a particular-

00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:41.273
participating college

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:43.375
university. And the necklace is

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:45.677
perspectives on the ways

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:46.244
students perceive experience

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.512
the campus racial climate. More

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.547
specifically the knack is

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:50.181
designed to not address whether

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:50.682
racism is present in an

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:53.485
institution. In fact it is

00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:54.085
designed to help institutions

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.587
identified the various ways

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.789
that institutional structural

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:59.424
interpersonal racism manifests.

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.393
The service comprised of sixty

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:03.628
five separate items across five

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.497
primary content areas the five

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:06.064
being battering affirmation

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.499
racial learning and literacy.

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:09.501
Across racial engagement

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.135
encounters with racial stress

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.603
appraisals of institutional

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.338
commitment and the impact of

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:15.440
external environments.

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.041
Currently he's content area

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.375
scored using racially

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:17.943
disaggregated metrics from

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.778
select blocks a survey items

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.613
with any particular domain and

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.348
their assigned ratings one

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:23.915
through four. And again we

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.784
thought this important because

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.719
often we have the data reported

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:29.721
it often just opposes white

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:30.355
students with everyone else and

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.756
so we thought it wasn't too

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:32.257
just aggravates we can

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.658
understand the specific

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:34.259
experiences of individualized

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.729
racial ethnic groups. During

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:38.296
the twenty eighteen twenty

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:38.964
nineteen academic year which is

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.798
our pilot your for the knack we

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.466
successfully administer the

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.401
survey nationally to more than

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.002
two hundred thousand students.

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.637
Including those it eight two

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:46.137
year and four year post

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:47.639
secondary institutions within

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.139
the state of which the

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.641
university of southern

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:50.175
California in those other

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.643
institutions here today are

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.645
represented. While attending

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.547
national St report of our data

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:56.181
is still being developed. I can

00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:57.549
share with you that our

00:26:57.615 --> 00:26:59.884
findings were consistent with

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:00.485
decades of research on campus

00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:03.588
racial climate. Secular between

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:04.255
white students and students of

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.523
color broadly were found in

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.492
every single content area some

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:08.093
of which were more pronounced

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.861
between specific racial ethnic

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:11.896
groups and their white peers

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.565
for example our findings among

00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:14.032
the California schools

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:15.934
routinely show gaps in cross

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.602
racial engagement that is that

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:18.169
students of color generally

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:19.804
were both more likely and more

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:20.238
open to engaging in

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.806
conversations about race with

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:23.808
white students than white

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:24.342
students were with their

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:25.610
students of color peers. This

00:27:25.677 --> 00:27:27.512
finding indicates a need for

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:29.447
college universities to

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:30.015
consider interventions that

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:33.852
better. Excuse me. Requires and

00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:34.452
to consider intervention the

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.221
better prepare white students

00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:37.756
to not only voluntarily engage

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:39.391
across racial difference. What

00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:40.058
to do so around issues of race

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.626
and racism in ways to

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:42.227
communicate and understanding

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:43.294
of their own privileged

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.296
positions within institutions

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.599
and society. Primarily governed

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.166
by powerful white people and

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:49.801
white supremacist ideologies.

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:51.703
Further our findings indicate

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.405
in under represent

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:53.938
underestimation of racial

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:55.306
minority students encounters

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:57.609
with racism by white students.

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:58.243
In particular yes something put

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:01.446
forward by many white students

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.013
within our assessment tools

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.581
that racially- CD raising my

00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:05.450
north high students experience

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.017
instances of racism in the

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:09.821
classroom on campus. I rates

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:10.455
far lower than self reported by

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.023
them. These about a few

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.525
examples including the

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:14.125
reporting bar data from our

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:15.760
participating institutions.

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:16.361
Each of which is provided an

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:17.629
individual and relatively

00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.564
confidential report. However I

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:20.098
want to focus for a moment

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:21.766
again on the external factors

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.902
associated with campus climate.

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:24.436
Forge relatively little

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.637
research has been conducted. In

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.672
the current socio political

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.574
climate. Which campus season

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:30.208
which is relatively dormant in

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.643
comparison to those in years

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.745
during Emily following the

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:34.379
election of Donald trump's the

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:35.947
presidency of the United

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:36.514
States. In this is a campus

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:39.484
racial violence of spite.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:40.051
According to a forthcoming

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.619
study led by size Stokes who

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:42.253
joins me today is a research

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.621
associate with our center. A

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:45.824
multi year data analysis shows

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.859
dramatic increases in races

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:48.493
verbal and physical attacks on

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.429
college campuses. Specifically

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.531
this study examines over three

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:54.099
hundred fifty reports from

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:55.400
higher education new sites

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:55.967
between twenty thirteen and

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:59.771
twenty eighteen. Between twenty

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:00.305
thirteen to twenty fifteen

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:00.939
specifically an annual average

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:01.940
of twenty seven incidents

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:03.775
occurred. However we sixteen

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:05.543
alone a high in nineteen

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.447
incidents were reported.

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:10.048
Yielding a 3100% increase the

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:13.785
year prior. Overall nearly two

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:14.452
with. Of all reported incidents

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:15.720
were violence against black

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:16.354
students specifically at white

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.622
universities. Additionally two

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.657
hundred nineteen of three

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:20.225
hundred fifty acts of racial

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.693
violence were patch waited by

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:24.562
white people. With another one

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:25.130
hundred twenty perpetrators

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:27.632
being on now. It's still. Soon

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.400
lives are not limited to this

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:30.068
the college university campuses

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.636
and often traverse the

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.438
boundaries between town and

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:34.038
gown this post new questions

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.141
regarding the safety a racing

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.542
mind or t&lt;c.cyan&gt; students in&lt;/c&gt;

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.143
trying to communities. Within

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:38.576
which post secondary

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:41.513
institutions are situated. The

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:42.113
comedian out look any further

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.450
for cases been within the state.

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:46.017
There is the presence of

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.620
recruitment fire's post about

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:49.220
white supremacist groups which

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.656
California leads. Or the anti

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.691
semitic anti black and if I can

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:55.527
look at goes along dorm walls

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:57.495
around the frequent presence is

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:58.062
of hate speech disguises the

00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:00.131
democratic debate of ideas. But

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.666
these phenomena in fact are

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.334
present across the UC CSU a

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.803
community college system. And

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.505
the name graver circumstances.

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.039
What students are rendered

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.374
immediately vulnerable the

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:09.974
moment they leave campus. In

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.410
ways entirely more violent than

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.511
those reported on campus. For

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.647
example that is considered

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:16.247
Humboldt state university here

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.615
in northern California. That

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:24.822
there. They're in city of

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:27.458
Arcadia on April fifteenth.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.026
Twenty seventeen David is I

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:28.560
lost in a black student at

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:29.127
humble state was stabbed to

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:31.396
death and all. After being

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:31.996
stabbed a size friend fellow

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.731
student ID channel begin

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:36.201
administering CPR while white

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:36.801
people at the scene reported

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:37.735
citing said and I quote. I wish

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:41.639
the **** does die. I really

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.408
hope that **** dies. More

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:45.577
police officers and other

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:46.144
emergency medical personnel

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.146
arrived at the scene it is

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:48.780
reported that they failed to

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:51.883
administer lifesaving aid their

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.417
different relator wasn't

00:30:52.483 --> 00:30:53.651
dysfunction at officers

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:54.285
further. To detain and question

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.587
any witnesses. A twenty four

00:30:55.653 --> 00:30:57.589
year old white man from

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.924
McKinley bill city nearby was

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.326
later arrested and indicted but

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:01.960
the case was later dismissed by

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:02.527
humble county Superior Court

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.430
judge. What is more the six.

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.064
Thousand dollar payment to the

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.599
national police foundation to

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.667
review a PT's conduct in the

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.437
case is yet to deliver its

00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:13.004
report. On the incident more

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:15.506
than two years later. And all

00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:16.074
the while. Charmaine Lawson.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.909
Decides whether has been left

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:18.543
without answers and without her

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:24.148
son. And to be completely sure.

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:24.749
Justice is not the furniture

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:25.350
report or civil settlement for

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:29.687
grieving mother. Justice it's

00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:31.689
just I Los and still being here.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:32.290
And so with that I again would

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:36.127
like to thank you for the time.

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:36.728
Madam chair and your the rest

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:48.373
my time for any questions. I

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:48.940
think you in your report you

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:51.676
indicated that. That the you

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.411
know you have a time frame of

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.647
the accident so- some folks

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:57.315
would say that it started

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:57.915
twenty sixteen others will say

00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:58.549
it started much earlier. What's

00:31:58.616 --> 00:32:01.452
your assessment. I in terms of

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.053
the races incident happening

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.988
yes- my assessment is that

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:05.490
these things have and will

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:07.525
continue to happen we know that

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:09.594
from the integration of.

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:10.194
Secular institutions in the

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.629
south up until today- that

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:12.230
campus racial violence is a

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:13.765
very real part of what people

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:15.566
are experiencing. And so

00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:16.134
although we may have seen a

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.435
spike in those incidents that

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.937
are reported that does not mean

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:20.571
that they weren't happening in

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:21.406
the same volume earlier on- but

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.308
in fact we have. Can isn't by

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:23.875
which we can report these

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.510
things when they do take place-

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:27.612
we also have press who in their

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.414
sensationalized. To review of

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.014
the way the world works also

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:33.351
want to be able to- monetize

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:33.851
some of the cliques by

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:34.452
reporting on these incidents

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:35.086
more frequently. Have you seen

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.855
any campus that's been very

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.424
successful in dealing with it

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.426
in my experience I have not. I

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:43.728
think many campuses are always

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:44.262
already ill prepared to

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.730
respond. Any particular

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.665
moments. And that is being

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:49.901
evidence so simply by students

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:50.535
who are taking a part of our

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:53.304
survey. Them often say that if

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:53.971
there is ever a response it is

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.973
only when tragedy strikes or

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.675
crisis arises. But there is not

00:32:57.742 --> 00:32:58.309
really preventive measures are

00:32:58.376 --> 00:32:59.577
being taken into account. I'm

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.813
even more so- that means to

00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:03.781
show leaders are falling back

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:05.616
on policies that do not account

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:06.250
for the way the campus racism

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:06.818
functions. To say that they

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:07.885
cannot intervene. They must

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:09.721
yield to. What they perceived

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.789
to be. A constitutional right.

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.257
Again to engage in what is

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.727
considered free speech although

00:33:15.793 --> 00:33:16.327
it takes me to deeply impacted

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:17.662
campus racial climate. Thank

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.764
you very much thank you there

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:20.298
may be some questions or

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.532
comments after. At the end one

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:22.133
of thank you with at this time

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.670
we're going to call our first

have been offering even though

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.027
there's a lot of amazing

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:37.795
programming and services being

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.463

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:41.799
racial biases and hateful

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.801
incidents happening in our

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:45.636
institutions. This summer us of

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.838
state campus there is anti

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:48.372
semitic messaging in our

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.807
bathrooms as far as promoting

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.609
xenophobia. I get students and

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:55.446
faculty members- last semester

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:56.080
we've had several students who

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.615
identified of white supremacy

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.550
king ethnic studies courses

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:05.690
questioning- faculty of.

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:06.223
Walking around faculty and

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.460
students. I cal state Fullerton

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:10.094
recently they've dealt with the

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.362
uses of the way Edward on

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:11.796
flyers from student

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:13.631
organizations on campus. I

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.700
called a police low recently

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.868
had students host a gathering

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.870
the end illegal aliens versus

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.706
cowboys I constantly ask myself

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.874
why racial Hippel incidents are

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.576
still continuing or campuses.

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.678
Are universities need to be

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.380
trying hard to ensure students

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:29.981
are feeling safe and to hold

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.716
students staff and faculty

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:35.853
accountable. For the racial and

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.354
hateful incident that we

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.655
participate in. I'm deeply

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.423
concerned for students safety

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:39.857
in the twenty twenty

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.792
presidential elections during

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.628

crimes usually go up in twenty

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.263

point 5% of. He crimes occurred

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.435
on college campuses being a

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.537
public university we're bound

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.406
to be in an open campus as well

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:55.973
in an open campus insurers

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.942
freedom of speech is Matt. Will

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.777
also ensures the outside groups

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:01.412
can come onto our campus

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.280
improvement he'd speech against

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.383
our students. We the university

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.017
in all stakeholders such as a

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:07.652
so should students and

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:08.119
academics and as of

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.553
universities you to provide

safe spaces for students and

have open forms to have these

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.693
conversations. I know so

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.728
citizens on my campus is the

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.363
official voice of students but

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.864
we have students are in

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.799
privileged positions. That need

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:23.601
to be reaching out to students

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.369
and holding administrators

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.872
accountable when he for racial

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:29.440
bias incidents occur. Instead

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:31.308
of using or cities being

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:31.809
reactive when incidents

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.844
occurred we need to be more

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:35.546
proactive in prevent these

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:36.213
incidents from happening in the

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.715
first place. I would like to

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.850
think assembly member Weber for

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.419
competing the panel and for

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:41.852
hearing on students

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:47.391
perspectives on racial. And

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:47.958
hateful bias incidents thank

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:55.533

this important hearing. And to

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.071
the Berkeley student

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:01.839
organizations for helping to

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:03.708
put this event together my name

00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:05.743

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.545
transfer at UC Berkeley I a

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.447
formerly attended summer and

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.315
you know Valley college- and

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:11.849
during my time but that

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:13.718
Berkeley and SPV see I've held

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.553
various leadership roles in an

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:16.187
effort to uplift. Marginalized

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:17.621
communities like my own Intel

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.590
crazy for and campus

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:21.392
environments for all students.

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:21.992
However today I'm here as a

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.461
student leader from MSE west

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.796
aye nonprofit organization that

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.465
works with thousands of Muslim

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:29.200
students across- various

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.435
campuses to provide. Programs

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:33.337
resources into is just support

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.372
the social- emotional and

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:35.973
spiritual needs of more some

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.142
students across California- we

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:41.612
believe that creating a- safe

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:42.146
campus environment for all

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.614
students meets having

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:45.483
culturally competent staff an

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:47.651
admin. Working together with

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.319
community to develop structural

00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.420
solutions to the many

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:49.920
challenges students are

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:53.657
experiencing. Today I am here

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:54.158
to talk about the often

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.626
overlooked perspective which is

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.328
that of the Muslim community.

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.563
We are one of the most diverse

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.164
communities with no singular

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.532
racial ethnic or identity

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.434
background that can you know

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:05.569
cap the intersections of our

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.638
experiences. However are some

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.507
of the most common challenges

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.408
that we face. Come from us some

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:11.976
of the student perspectives

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:15.479
which- students experiences at

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.848
the UC CSU in committee college

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:21.318
level. Basically lack any data

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.654
on our community- most public

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.157
institutions have very little

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.525
data. Are specific to the most

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.693
some identity or when there are

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.562
attempts to capture this

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:33.430
information it is usually. Only

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.833
used aren't Africa south Asian

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.434
groups which will is a step

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:39.703
forward excludes significant

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:40.271
portions of most of student

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.605
community that clued. But not

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:42.173
limited to black là next

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:45.442
southeast Asian and white most

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:51.649
some students- because of this

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:55.586
lack of data as a west partner.

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.187
Institutions on social policy

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:57.555
and understanding to conduct an

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:58.155
initial large skilled research

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.824
study on. I'm going to some

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.392
sort of population that

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.026
analyzes the population's needs

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.828
holistically- this past January

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:05.529
you we collected data from over

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:07.398
five hundred students and this.

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:07.932
Search basically found in

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:09.500
various forms of

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.635
discrimination- in whether it

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.504
was political community

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.439
engagement identity wise- there

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.641
was a lot of discrimination

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:18.242
that our students are facing

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.710
and I wanted to share some of

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:21.478
that with you guys today-

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.547
according to the research that

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.382
we did we found that 63% of

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.751
Muslim student respondents-

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:28.385
reported facing some level of

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:29.887
religious discrimination in the

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.755
past year. And fourteen point

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.624
2% of the students have

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.158
reported facing religious

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.626
discrimination on campus from

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.828
professors in the past year

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:39.663
with woman reporting a higher

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.032
rate than men- I personally

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.334
experienced many such incidents

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.669
including my very first

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:46.270
semester summer do you know

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.473
Valley college right. A

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.074
mandatory cool history course

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.744
where. In the first week of

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.546
class my professor presented

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:56.080
very Islamophobic talking

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:57.548
points to the entire class- he

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.516
claimed that Muslims forced

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:01.552
women to dress a certain way

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.687
that Muslims abused women that

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.288
we worshipped. A moon god and

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.856
we refuse to move forward. The

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.424
rest of the world and we were

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.326
stuck in medieval and backwards

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:13.497
mentality. As the first week

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.131
like very early during my first

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.599
week of college. How do not

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:16.200
experience it was completely

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.470
horrifying and quite honestly

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:20.070
it was extremely intimidating

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:21.839
because here is somebody that

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.741
is supposed to be- providing us

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:27.511
with. Information and yet he is

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:28.178
turned down my identity and who

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:31.515
I am as a person. And to watch

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:32.149
my peers take that in as fast

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:35.452
as truth is honestly very

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.821
hurtful and- eventually led to

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.957
me. Doing extremely bottom not

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.525
class I ended up not being able

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.594
to engage with my peers or my

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.429
professor. Because this was

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.331
extremely triggering to past

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:47.898
experiences that I had of

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:50.100
verbal and physical abuse

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.702
because of you know some of the

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.604
big rhetoric. And so you know

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.839
not having any adequate support

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.675
or resources from the campus to

00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:02.646
navigate the situation I

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:05.249
ultimately feel that course-

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:07.718
again you know I had a similar

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:08.285
experience was a of course.

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:13.657
World. My professor use a text

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.592
book by in a slump phobic Asama

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:17.761
phobic non most some who

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:18.362
basically portrayed Asama as

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.663
that backwards religion and

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.667
just. You know pretty much

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:24.234
toward on my identity as a

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.070
Muslim and created a very

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:27.538
hostile environment for myself

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:30.007
especially when my peers are

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:30.641
taking all this information in

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:33.344
and seeing it as fact and that

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.978
is how they are engaging with

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.846
me after you know seeing that

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.748
information- according to some

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.850
of the- research study that we

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.919
did. You know a lot of our

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.687
students. Reported that even

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:45.789
with administration they are

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:47.925
unable to report these issues

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:50.260
or that they don't feel like

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.395
reporting these issues will be

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.864
affected to our administration

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.432
our survey found that 10% of

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.066
the respondents who. Reported

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.801
facing religious discrimination

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.737
on campus are actually face

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:02.206
that from administration as

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:05.843
well so- which is extremely

00:44:05.909 --> 00:44:07.611
high number to face the disk to

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:08.078
Fuhrman ministration

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:09.847
considering most students don't

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:11.615
usually interact with

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.051
administration- campus climate

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.419
is affected by a number of

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.421
factors. But most significantly

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.391
it also includes our peers and

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:21.458
being out of school like UC

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.794
Berkeley you all are Sir found

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:25.696
that 31% of most in college and

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.865
in California reported facing

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.933
religious discrimination from

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.468
their peers on their call

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:35.272
campuses other at Berkeley you

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.941
know we see that with. When our

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:38.475
hello here's our you know

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:43.714
holding. Out. In guest speakers

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:44.248
who are actually renowned

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:50.054
renowned. When students in our

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.587
classroom discussions are

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:51.522
echoing the dangerous rhetoric

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:52.156
that vilify just Pham or 181%

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.590
of most of students who have

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:54.158
been approached. To exponent

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:55.592
splaine controversial topics

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:56.126
about it. This indicates

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.761
collectively- instead these

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.263
incidents collectively

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.665
contribute to a hostile climate

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:03.500
that impacts all aspects of our

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.636
lives including our ability to

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:07.337
learn and thrive on campus- in

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:07.771
addition to the over

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:09.740
discrimination on campus is one

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.275
of the most pressing issues

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:11.909
faced by the most of students

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:14.011
on campus recently has been the

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.379
surge of surveillance programs.

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:17.381
Primarily impacting most

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:17.981
someone box to dance in the

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.716
past few years have been-

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.485
counter violent extremism

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.387
programs being implemented on

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:23.921
college campuses across

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:27.357
California- CVS the department

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.359
of homeland security program

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:29.993
that began in two thousand and

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.462
eleven. To address rider

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:33.664
station in America by targeting

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.298
the Muslim community through a

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:35.432
national security framework

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:38.035
that firms Muslims especially

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.570
youth has been prone to

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:41.939
radicalization. Initially CV

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:42.473
programs took the form of

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:43.941
grants for DHS to target cities

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.742
across the nation meant to

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.711
distribute community

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:51.748
organizations. To minority most

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:57.621
some communities. And report

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:58.188
the information back to the

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:58.822
federal government sick of time

00:45:58.889 --> 00:45:59.590
tonight I cannot go into

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.925
further the full scope of CVS

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:02.526
and its impact on the most and

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.060
community brought for the

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:03.627
purpose of this hearing. I

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.228
would like to highlight that

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:04.795
recently we have seen TV

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:05.996
programs surfacing on campuses

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.798
across California including. UC

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:11.635
Berkeley UCLA UC Irvine casting

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.770
summoned you know and more.

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:15.506
These often take place in the

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:17.741
shape of professors research on

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:21.445
course works on campuses. With

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:22.012
one enforcement and federal

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.447
agencies to create programs and

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:24.081
produce research on terrorism

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:26.383
counter by. Counter terrorism

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.553
and violent extremism that

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.187
targets does that they believe

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.722
are the biggest risk. Being

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.590
Muslims. These types of

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.626
programs create paranoia and

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:36.059
distrust and hostile

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.928
environments for those were the

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:39.530
targets of surveillance. And

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:41.565
have long lasting impacts on

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:42.199
already vulnerable communities

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:43.700
the most of community has been

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:44.201
subject to unwarranted.

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.502
Surveillance for decades

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.804
especially post nine eleven and

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:49.573
the uptake of CV programs

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.140
throughout the community and

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:53.610
now on campuses in particularly

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:54.211
concerning for the safety of

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:55.812
most well being of my some

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:57.781
students I am only touch on the

00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:02.186
surface of this. Here on the

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:02.853
explanation and impact of these

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.387
programs and we would be

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:03.954
interested in following up

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:04.588
conversations with folks from

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.656
the legislature. And from-

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:07.758
campus system discuss the topic

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:09.660
and impact it has on the well

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:13.864
being of students- all in all I

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:14.531
would just like to say that the

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:15.799
most of students you know are

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.401
facing a variety of challenges-

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:19.636
and we would love to. Have you

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.371
know further discussion on

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:22.005
these are topics and we would

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.907
love to share the MSA west

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.776
report with both the campus

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.544
community as well as the

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.413
legislature. To discuss these

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:31.615
topics further and to follow up

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.216
and have for the conversation

00:47:32.282 --> 00:47:33.483
on these- and with that I would

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:38.222
like to thank the- committee

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:38.789
chair for hope. Having us I

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:41.558
think they are you thank you.

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.760
Our next speaker is the dumbest

00:47:43.827 --> 00:47:47.564
Dominic. So I thank chairman

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.131
Weber and the committee for

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:48.765
having the speech you all today

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:51.401
in having your hearing at UC

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:53.670
Berkeley- the worst you see for

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.539
black students according to the

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.474
U. S. he said he release this

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.041
year and according to black

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.509
students for a while now. My

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:02.613
name is Dominique Williams and

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.014
I am a graduating senior at cal

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.716
and I'm the first in my family

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.484
to go to college. I've been

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.486
intimately involved in

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.053
California higher education

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.523
policy for the last four years

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.157
as an advocate in our campuses

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:15.525
student government. Meeting

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:17.361
with state legislators to

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:17.894
communicate soon issues

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:19.596
directly to the years of

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:21.832
Sacramento. Also when I think

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:25.202
doctor Weber for passing AB

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:25.802
three ninety to the California

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:26.370
act to save lives. We needed

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:29.306
that. Additionally I have

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.708
served- roles here on campus as

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:32.209
our black city you use

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.477
community program director and

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.479
also spearheaded the creation.

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:37.681
Of a statewide campaign. Named

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.750
racial justice now which is

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.385
housing operated under the

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:41.885
university of California

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:45.555
student association. I've

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:46.189
actually spoken on the select

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.691
committee before as a witness

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.426
to other structural issues that

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.728
California California tie

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.296
ducation system has and I'm

00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:53.397
grateful to be here today. I

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:55.732
believe it is incredibly

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.701
symbolic to have this hearing

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.569
here given that given what we

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.438
know about the black experience

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.507
a cow. I can appreciate the

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.141
messes this hearing will have

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:07.411
not only. To the administration

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:08.078
at this campus but also to the

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:09.746
rest of the UC administration

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:10.280
including our outgoing and

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:13.483
incoming you see president's.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.117
Students have known for a while

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.952
now is that despite the common

00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:17.821
descriptor of a progressive

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:19.790
campus in the most progressive

00:49:19.856 --> 00:49:21.525
city in the world. Students of

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:22.092
color tend to suffer a UC

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.694
Berkeley. The twenty fourteen

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.896
campus climate report for which

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:27.564
we are all reflecting on here

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.198
today highlighted that students

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.866
of color and black students

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.768
especially. Felt alienated in

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.670
uncomfortable on all of our UC

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:37.341
campuses. What's more is that

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:37.908
many black staff members in

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.543
faculty felt the same way.

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.411
That's understandable

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.045
considering that many of our

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.780
black staff members are

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.515
unionized and often told their

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:47.718
labor isn't as valuable as it

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:48.218
should be by are you see

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:53.423
ministration. But it is surely.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.024
That report sparked H. were

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.325
sparked by a trail of over

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.394
instances of discrimination on

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:58.028
our campuses. Revealed that our

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:01.531
campuses have a problem. In

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:02.065
that problem has arguably

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.533
gotten worse. I say that

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.902
because there are at less under

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.738
represented minorities and

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:09.406
black students on our campus is

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:09.940
here now then in twenty

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.842
fourteen. And the students have

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.477
not felt their sentiments being

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:15.412
translated and reverberated by

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.748
the administration. That's not

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:18.181
to say that our our

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:19.649
administration has made no

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:21.618
effort UC Berkeley has rolled

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.152
out the African American

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.787
initiative features cautious

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.689
were small courts of about two

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.591
dozen students. Administration

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.726
me regularly with the black

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:30.227
student union and other

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.361
affinity groups on campus

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:33.630
strides have been made and I

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.565
think our vice chancellor an

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:37.334
assistant vice chancellor Oscar

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:37.834
to money muted well. For

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:41.471
helping our student leaders.

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.105
But these efforts are not felt

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:42.606
by large swaths of our

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:43.540
communities because

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.609
unfortunately. The conditions

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:47.411
they are experiencing at

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.479
Berkeley have not changed.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.147
Black students are still facing

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:53.450
instances of discrimination on

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.017
our campuses they are still

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.519
facing police discrimination

00:50:55.585 --> 00:50:57.854
and brutality despite you see

00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:59.756
B. D. receiving more training

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:00.323
than any other department in

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.792
the country. At least that's

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:04.027
what they say. And soon still

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.495
feel like they don't belong.

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:09.599
I'll give us all an example.

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:10.133
Following the passage of

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.435
proposition two oh nine which

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:11.968
banned affirmative action

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.470
across the state the UC

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:15.605
implemented what are called

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.407
student academic preparation in

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:19.409
educational partnerships or say

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:21.445
pet programs to address the

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:23.413
real income education and

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.014
racial gaps that have played

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.515
our education institutions.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.651
These programs have been

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:28.118
heralded by the state

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.686
legislature as the primary

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.321
means of promoting diversity at

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:33.824
the UC but year after year

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.059
since two thousand five they

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.227
receive pay cut after pay cut

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:37.761
and there funding in real

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:41.631
dollars has decreased coupled

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:42.232
with rising housing costs. And

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:47.337
skyrocketing tuition. Black

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:47.971
students and students of color

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:49.506
because of the systemic

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.173
marginalization that are cancer

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.575
mentioned earlier in our

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:55.245
society are too often also our

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:57.547
lowest income students and are

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:58.114
hit hardest by the lack of

00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:01.585
resources. We definitely feel

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:02.152
like we don't belong if we

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:05.589
can't afford to go here. Almost

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:06.156
starve ourselves in order to

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:07.524
afford our books. Another

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:08.091
example that's a little more

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:13.663
intimate. You see PT please use

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.332
the PT that's had a terrible

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:17.234
police officer on its payroll

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.769
for decades name officer Shauna

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:21.371
Ramos bass number seventy six.

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:25.675
People Noah. This officer has

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:26.209
terrorize members of our

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.777
community both on and off

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:31.348
campus his claim to fame being

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:31.781
when he arrested and

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:35.385
confiscated the wallets of a

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:35.986
Latino hot dog vendor at a cal

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.554
football game. One black

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.623
student in particular has been

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.525
literally harass by this

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:43.793
officer over six times for

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.394
fraud in the soon to not be a

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:47.764
student. He was so bad that he

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.366
became a symbol for us of just

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:49.966
how by bad cops can be and how

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:53.837
much they can get away with.

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:54.404
And finally after years of

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:57.374
complaints. Petitions meetings

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.442
and investigations. UC Berkeley

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:03.747
led arenas retire. Retired he

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:07.250
wasn't fired he wasn't brought

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:09.452
to justice he was let he left

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.254
with the retirement plan and

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:11.888
could serve at any other police

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:15.425
department if you wanted to. At

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:16.026
offices symbolize how much we

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.429
really meant to this university.

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:20.096
Fortunately my colleague marine

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:21.765
will delve more into our police

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.800
relations but adding that to a

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.669
lack of resources black face a

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.671
UCLA in twenty thirteen deport

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:29.739
them all signs at UC San Diego

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:33.410
and you see more said in twenty

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:34.010
seventeen and a disaster over

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:35.478
free speech week last year.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.681
Black students especially have

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:38.281
been reminded that we are not

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:41.818
welcome. And that's probably

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:42.485
part of the story that U. S. C.

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:45.488
report black students face a

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.122
graduation gap of 16% compared

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.691
to the campus as a whole black

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:48.325
shoes complete Berkeley at a

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:51.528
rate that's 15% lower than the

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.563
rest of the campus and this by

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.097
making up over 6% of the

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:57.634
California population. Black

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.234
students are only one point 9%

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:01.404
of this campus. We are

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.273
underserved in under taught not

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:03.840
just at Berkeley by the way

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:07.310
that all of our UC campuses.

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:09.946
That USC report validated will

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:10.480
black students have been

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.948
feeling for decades. Like to

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:12.482
have a special then on our

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:15.418
campus called black Wednesday.

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:16.052
Every Wednesday all of the all

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.854
the black students gather for

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.522
the Golden Bear cafe to exist

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.992
with one another to meet each

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:22.525
other. And just enjoy each

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:23.593
other's company. It's a space

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.729
re created for ourselves when

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.764
we didn't have one a place to

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:28.365
listen to music and see each

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.633
other on campus. Because it's

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.368
been so where to see ourselves

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.570
anywhere else in our classrooms

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:34.137
in our discussions when our

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:35.739
dorm rooms. For decades student

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.674
leaders that organizes of and

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.676
have had a harder and harder

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.277
time to yield a sizeable crowd

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:43.446
AB like Wednesday. We felt our

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:45.582
numbers dwindle every year soon

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:47.384
as dropped out after two years

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.951
our brothers and sisters are

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:49.352
falling in between the car the

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:51.888
cracks. Crushed by the lack of

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.489
support the receiving by this

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:55.825
campus. For so long are

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:56.426
concerned- receipt then brush

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:57.827
away. With administrative as

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.629
ministration anticipating. That

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.464
the graduation of student

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.032
leaders can induce and then

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.667
some spell of a short term

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:05.535
memory loss. Recycling four

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:07.537
year old ideas and

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.104
conversations and sending it

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:11.408
back years of progress. So for

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:11.908
all of us in the room a

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:15.812
reminder. Proposition two one

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.280
nine devastated the numbers of

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:17.881
black Latin American native

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.849
American Pacific Islander in

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:20.450
middle eastern students on our

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:25.488
campuses. We have asked for our

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.122
campus in the UC administration

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:27.724
directly to take a stand of

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.626
opposition to proposition two

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.728
or nine. And work with you

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.596
number of are the members of

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.230
our state legislature to recall

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.732
the proposition. We ask you

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:39.569
know. Choose a color and black

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:41.705
students to work with the

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:42.272
students of color black in

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.606
black students to overturn

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.642
proposition two or nine so that

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:47.711
our students can receive the

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:48.244
resources they need. To be

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.713
taught equitably. An additional

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.648
asked we have is to better

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.283
support are safe at programs.

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.817
Free ongoing funding that

00:55:53.883 --> 00:55:55.785
restores and maintains state

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.620
support tied to inflation

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:58.188
undergrads an undergraduate

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:01.458
population growth. You see

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.058
students and staff alike have

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:05.528
been squeezed of resources for

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.129
over a decade and I diversity

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.464
has suffered as a result.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.632
Culture senator recruitment

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:10.233
centers are utilizing student

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.468
labor like their full time

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.001
employees and they're not

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:15.472
getting paid for it. In order

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:16.005
to make up the loss of the

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:19.709
state induce. Are soon as well

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:20.343
on campus and those who may one

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.845
day envision themselves here

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:23.813
need to feel like they can

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.582
belong here. These are a few

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:26.216
ways we can start and I welcome

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.517
my colleagues to share their

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:31.321
testimony as and also offer

00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:31.921
their recommendations for you

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.523
all thank you. Thank you. Thank

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.859
you very much. Maureen Simmons.

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.827
Thank you first I want to say

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:39.796
thank you so much to you

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.664
assembly member Dr Shirley

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.566
Weber for. Grazing in our

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:45.735
campus today. And it means so

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.570
very much to not only UC

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:49.305
Berkeley but- I am certain that

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.374
time your presence and

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.676
recommendations I'm will be

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:55.378
felt throughout this see

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.714
issues- cece's. And the UC

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:01.451
system. My name is Maureen

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:03.620
Simmons and- this is my last

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:07.524
semester at UC Berkeley. It's

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.492
so important for me today to-

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.628
to have this meeting. As my

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:12.195
colleague Dominic Williams

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.763
pointed out it was roughly

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.632
about a year ago that I sat in

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:19.402
a room. And with members of our

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.371
black student leaders and we

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:21.938
discussed that U. S. the

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.706
article. I was my first

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:25.742
semester here on the campus of

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.577
UC Berkeley and as a first

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.746
generation older student. I was

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:33.383
heartbroken. At just the fact

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:33.950
that students felt someone

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:37.687
welcomed- at first and want to

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:39.522
believe it and then. Very

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.624
quickly I soon began to realize

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:47.497
that this was a space that was

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.064
quite hostile to people that

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:53.303
look like me. I am the timing

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:53.970
of relevance of this is so very

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.672
important and I don't want that

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.507
to be to go unnoticed. The

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.709
procedure I am so to the roles

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.544
that I have on the campus one

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:03.847
of them is the internal terror

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.448
police oversight and I want to

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.383
talk about specific examples of

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.853
the relationships between black

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.521
students on this campus and you

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.790
see P. D. N. how all that

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.859
interplay's with the racial

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:19.329
tensions on the campus my role

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:21.598
as the internal chair of police

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.633
oversight is to provide

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.635
recommendations to the

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.704
community leaders as well as

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.441
to- are relevant stakeholders

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:31.941
which would include our

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.509
chancellor's office. I have had

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.612
the opportunity to meet with

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:39.415
our cancer- on an occasion last

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.384
semester and I want to talk

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.620
about to loop of the incidents

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.220
that led to the conversations

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:45.889
all of two thousand eighteen as

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:47.724
I said I'm members of the S.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.327
you see- spearheaded by myself

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:53.496
and members of other black

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.465
student organizations how to

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:55.932
conversation with the

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.634
chancellor's office following

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.569
an incident where it was

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:01.537
determined that you see PD use

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:03.539
excessive force in response to

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.541
a campus incident for faculty

00:59:05.608 --> 00:59:07.343
members were staging a peaceful

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.913
protest- when video surfaced of

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.614
the police and county Mister

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.483
David Cole could be seen

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:15.451
surrounded. Their protesters as

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:19.722
UC PD. Made contact with the

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:23.626
men of simply arrested him.

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:25.795
Another incident is earlier

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:26.296
this year my office was

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:26.896
involved in an incident what

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:27.463
was brought to my attention

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.964
that one of our African

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.399
American female students. Who

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.334
is currently enrolled suffered

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.436
an encounter with UC PD that

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:35.605
resulted in her arrest. That

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:37.373
student suffered severe trauma

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.242
and mental anguish and is still

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:41.477
traumatized to this day. I

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.078
placed several phone calls to

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.846
UC PD as is required by my

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:47.750
office. I was able to set up a

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:48.318
meeting with our chief of

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:49.652
police Margot Bennett and also

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.688
lieutenant Julie Williams who

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:55.425
has worked and closely with my

00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:56.059
office and the a as you see on

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.627
similar incidents. You're not

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:01.464
meeting I was really. Taken

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.566
aback by one of the comments

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.535
that. Chief Bennett said in an

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:07.337
in essence not a direct quote

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.339
but she talked about her lack

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:09.973
of understanding of where this

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.908
rage racial animosity comes

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.676
from in the fact that as a

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.845
white. Female that she just

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.447
really simply does not

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.482
understand and cannot really

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.651
empathize with black people but

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.419
that she hopes to get there one

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.521
day. To lead our police

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.590
department and not understand

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.926
what the- implications of that

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.761
sort of mindset is was

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:35.631
completely as far as I was

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.467
concerned unacceptable. I am

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:39.902
following that meeting and

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.537
conversation- I'm- lieutenant

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:43.473
Williams said in the

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.475
conversation something else

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.075
that was really startling and

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.910
it speaks to the racial

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.445
tensions on this campus. He

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:50.079
talked about the fact that the

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.814
student who was only guilty of

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.750
having a taser and when she

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.718
tried to give the taser over to

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.687
the police officer. There was a

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.689
struggle that ensued just

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.758
because they said she reached

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:05.795
for the taser. And they tackled

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.497
her arrested her and the

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.732
response that I ask was there

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.667
any other way to handle that

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.369
what I was told by lieutenant

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.738
Williams is. In essence she's

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.774
lucky that we didn't shoot her

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.675
and if we would have shot her

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:25.448
it would have been. Killed. The

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.683
fact that are UC PD- for some

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.251
of you it's the first time

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:28.818
you're hearing that but- for

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:29.485
the fact that are you see PD

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.287
was here and supposed to be a

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:31.888
part of our campus community

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.723
and team. To ensure that

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.625
students not only feel safe

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.660
here but welcome here what have

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.462
the attitude that they would

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.564
think that it's okay to say

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.566
that we would shoot a student.

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:47.470
Over a taser is startling when

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.405
I met with chancellor Chris I

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.674
am price I asked that was there

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.709
any way that we can begin to

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.578
manage our relationships

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.413
between that the UC PD and

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.916
students. I talked about the

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.617
fact that white students. I am

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.953
large don't have the same types

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.588
of incidences. Of the things

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:09.525
that I asked for I'm that we

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.193
thought was very reasonable was

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.061
the fact that we wanted police

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.830
vehicles Berkeley is a very

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.631
heavily militarized. On campus

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.733
when you come on to our campus

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.702
the first thing that you see if

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:21.537
you enter from the MLK side our

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:24.073
police vehicles. Right behind

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:24.674
an adjacent to those police

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.708
vehicles is our Fannie Lou

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.710
Hamer center with our black

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.512
student resource center I asked

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.647
can we move the police vehicles

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.516
because it's traumatizing that

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.016
black students bill that

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.985
they're in circled in in case.

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:39.755
By police and I was told that

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.724
we could do that. To date that

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.759
has not happened another thing

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.661
that we ask during that meeting

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.597
this if we could have more

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.599
sensitivity training for police

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.400
officers so that when they

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.269
engage with black students in

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:53.870
particular. Given the climate

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.805
that we have in this country

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.740
it's not just on this campus on

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.709
this country that we need to

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.944
begin to be able to deal better

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.779
we were told that we would get

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:07.517
that. To date we have not done

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.418
that finally we asked if we

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.387
could have the police not look

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.556
like numbers of swat because

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.391
this is a college. As they

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.527
should be part of the allege

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:18.127
culture we're talking about a

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:23.733
reasonable. Request to date

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:35.411
they still look like swapped.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.513
Black students have continued

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.382
to raise and finally in my last

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.584
few comments I want to piggy

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.151
back on what my colleague

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.619
Dominic Williams said. In

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.521
regards to proposition two oh

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.924
nine. Just a few months ago

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.625
when the members of the UC yes

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.294
they met and we begin to talk

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:51.861
about the strategic efforts

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.930
that we could take to begin to

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.398
deal with the issues that

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:57.300
students face in the UC system.

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.602
I thought. We have to repeal

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.304
two oh nine to get anything

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.472
done. That is an effort that we

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:04.106
are leading as students we are

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:07.677
asking the- administration to

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.545
join in that effort to repeal

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.514
proposition two oh nine. And as

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.616
student we believe that that

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.851
will create a more harmonious

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.720
impressed I'm- more harmonious

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:21.290
culture for us. And on UC

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.726
system CSU systems as well as

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:24.293
the season with that I think

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:31.534
you. Thank you our our final

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:36.906
speaker for the day. Good

administrators members of the

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:48.184
community I would like to for

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.819
start up a recognizing this

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.487
land and its indigenous people

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.121
members of the who Chen alone

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.689
the tribe we must recognize

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.891
this sad sad history of this

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.727
land and the genocide that

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:58.361
occurred. For the university to

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:01.831
be built. Secondly I want to

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:02.365
thank doctor Weber in her

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.399
office for the time they have

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.000
spent. In the development of

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.668
this event their commitment to

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.837
stern activism and up lifting

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:08.437
the margin and up lifting the

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.438
voices of marginalized

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.540
communities. Lastly I would

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.576
like to recognize. The students

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.143
of this community who have

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.478
contributed to development of

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.480
this event. And those who allow

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.615
their passions to drive their

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.450
commitment into carrying out

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.286
the work. Thank you to marine.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.388
Dominic on the Tara Varsha.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:29.358
Lucky a million and local. As

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:29.959
we speak about the injustices

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.694
and hardships faced by students

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.328
of color and the institution of

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.496
higher education. I want to

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:35.898
encourage folks to be cognizant

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.566
of the reasons for why we are

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.435
here more specifically I want

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.671
people to reflect on why it has

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.639
been five years. Since students

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:44.173
have see very to little no

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:44.774
change and how they are being

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.743
met. I acknowledge that the few

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:48.344
changes that have taken place

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.645
in the past five years.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.714
Certainly I Berkeley have been

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.449
born out of black student

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.785
activism. Not university

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:57.520
officials are region's. For

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:59.922
example the Fannie Lou hammer

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:00.489
black resource center the

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.524
African American initiative and

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.091
the two but mental health

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:05.461
therapist we have today our our

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.463
fruits of the labor of blacks

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.064
in activism in twenty fifteen.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.634
And on were today. As a

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:12.268
sophomore stern here cap. My

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.569
experiences have been nothing

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.338
short of Dominic statement I

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.473
still to this day remember in

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.542
ways I was welcome. To this

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.310
campus as a black Muslim

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.446
identifying male. I remember

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:23.946
being met was there's a

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.815
confusion irrational fear an

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.750
outcast ostracized by peers and

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.752
their families alike. As I

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:30.353
moved into the residence hall

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:33.656
on day one. It is and has been

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.825
a commonality among our blocks

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.793
the population for blacks it is

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.395
to not feel as welcomed on this

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:41.530
campus as our non black peers

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.532
slash counterparts. It is too

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.568
often wear black students are

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:46.202
faced with the cost of policing

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:51.507
by. Of their rights and a and

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.642
access to this camp is and it

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:54.243
is known practice for you see

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.811
PD to ideas and be and us to

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.913
feel isolated by you see

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.782
employees. I will never forget

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:00.316
the moment during my first

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:03.919
semester. Mid term season I was

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:04.520
leaving Moffit library around

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:07.757
two AM. And stop I used to be

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.592
the officer asked a series of

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.226
questions about my whereabouts

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:10.826
with the assumption that I was

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:13.462
not a student here. After

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.564
coming to the conclusion that I

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.333
am indeed a student here cal.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:17.900
He let me go and I returned

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.735
home safe. When we talk about

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:25.474
safety who can afford. For

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:26.075
students such as myself who

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.443
carry them narrative a multiple

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:28.077
marginalize identities and is

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.578
predominant white and east

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:31.447
Asian American space we know

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.716
these encounters are very much

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:34.283
a part of our everyday lives

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.453
both on and off campus. So the

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.789
question becomes what is safety

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:40.389
and what is that look like for

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:43.592
black people. When the curry

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.795
CPD chief of the UC Santa Cruz

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.563
is a state police officer who

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.063
pepper sprayed innocent

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.231
students during a demonstration

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:51.834
at UC Davis. And when you see

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.402
PT officers at UC Santa Barbara

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.571
filed a lawsuit against the CPD

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.038
for discrimination and

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.606
harassment the workplace simply

01:07:57.673 --> 01:08:01.243
for trying to be better cops.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:01.844
We know that you see P. D. as

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.512
an institution is problematic.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:05.347
In fact a diversity projects

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.450
spearheaded by the chances

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.083
office. Found that students of

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.785
color one UC Berkeley's

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.654
administration to and I quote.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.923
Consider entry experiences of

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.424
policing as a key dimension. Of

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.426
campus belonging and address

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.428
the needs and concerns reported

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:19.895
by students. Who have

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.831
experience negative encounters

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.566
with the police directly and

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:24.200
you're care sleep. Especially

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:27.503
black students LGBT because

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.338
LGBT Q. aye plus students.

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.407
Nontraditional students. And

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.007
students from underrepresented

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.776
minority groups. I asked over

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.478
twenty black students to

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.880
describe their feelings about

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:41.350
cal with one word. Dangerous

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.853
dramatic safe hopeless on heard

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:47.556
depressive anxious terrorizing

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:48.023
marginalizing useless

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:51.427
heartbreaking oppressive

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.496
community questionable tiring

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:53.896
over burdening and

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:57.700
uncomfortable. These are just

01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:59.401
some of their responses for the

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.737
built in the room I would like

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:02.371
you all to be aware of them and

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:03.772
for the students in the room

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.341
look no further than the person

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.476
sitting next to you because

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.010
many the participants are

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:08.577
sitting right here with us.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:11.580
Today. These feelings translate

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.147
the poor and the performance

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.749
levels. Putting back in Boston

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.250
is at a disadvantage in

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:17.353
comparison to their non. Like

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:19.722
invested appears. Not to

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:20.356
mention the fact that many of

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:21.357
these students double jobs

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.626
families and activities beyond

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:24.226
the classroom. We know when

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:25.861
students feel safe and welcomed

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.630
they perform better and in

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.698
return promote a healthier

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.634
campus climate. However when

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.502
students come to the campus

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.504
with their outside experiences

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.171
of having to live in a world of

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.640
racism. Misogyny Islamophobia

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.575
xterra coupled with their

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.577
experiences within student body

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:42.211
here I cal hopelessness becomes

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.447
the reality. This is in

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.683
addition to the fact that black

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.652
and white next the this is in

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.253
addition to the lack of black

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:51.854
in the annex staff faculty and

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.822
administrators. Take a look at

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.491
our campus in your cabin and

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:55.958
what you'll find is a

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:59.461
predominant white ministration

01:09:59.528 --> 01:09:59.895
that is tasked. With

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:00.462
inclusivity of all people on

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.530
campus. I noticed of

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.632
conversation to have but as

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.668
university as human beings we

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.570
must be aware. Of how this

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:08.170
campus and many others within

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.271
the state of California.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.540
Disproportionately affect. And

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:12.041
continue to marginalize

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:15.511
students of color. Our tax

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.011
dollars go to the same

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:16.545
institutions that her and

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:19.615
traumatize our youth. And it's

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:21.584
only right that we ask the

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.151
necessary questions to hold

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:25.421
administration accountable. So

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.690
what does that look like

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.525
legislatively I propose that

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.159
the state legislators allocate

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.527
more funny to the you see that

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.362
goes to support one is programs

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:33.963
and resources for black about

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:35.798
communities on our campus. This

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.633
a good staff and faculty and

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.167
should expense each campus

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:38.667
throughout the state of

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.637
California. This here I

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.439
Berkeley are are black

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.574
committee has a- African

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:46.175
Americans to develop office.

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.743
And the Fannie Lou black cam

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.310
resource center which I'll

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:51.780
mention again with the center

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:52.381
that was fought for not given

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:53.549
by the Universitarios I suggest

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.684
that the state legislators

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:56.318
focus on intensely supporting

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.820
marginalized groups within our

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.321
campus community. And think of

01:10:59.388 --> 01:10:59.888
ways on how they can for the

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.457
support the state ability of

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.892
them. I'd advise the campus

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.361
administration actively listen

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:05.961
to the grievances of students

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:07.930
of color. And one express their

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:11.400
needs. And actually work with

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:12.001
them to solve these problems

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.869
with agency. Berkeley needs to

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.638
and should recognize that there

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.373
is a crisis within the ways in

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.475
which black students engage

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.109
with this campus. As stated in

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.744
the US the report. While the

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.579
study did not cover approve any

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.814
new information what it did do.

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.683
Was validate the sentiments

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.250
from the community and raise

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.585
awareness and conversation

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.152
around the bodies. Of black

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.789
students in higher education

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:34.390
and within the context of this

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:38.193
campus. If people are serious

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.727
about tackling the campus

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.561
climate issues. See the UC

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:40.129
Berkeley undergraduates the

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:41.397
diversity project campus

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:41.930
experience working group's

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:42.498
recommendations that I cited

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.601
earlier. I want to thank

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.336
members of the community for

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.438
the resilience I am and

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.440
dedication to persevere despite

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:52.074
the legacies of prop two nine

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.542
and racism as these

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.544
institutions were not

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:56.078
originally built for us I

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.546
continue to thrive off that

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.682
notion. You see Burke as

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.383
institution oppose systematic

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:01.950
oppression it continues to

and work closely with black

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:20.569
about students. They get a

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.870
ticket Jackson who is director

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.806

of times been there for us and

students and finally I want to

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:30.312
thank you to my ancestors

welcome before me I sacrifice.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:36.051
Their lives for me to be here

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:36.618
today doing this work. Thank

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:43.726
you. Want to thank all of our

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:47.529
student panelists. Even as much

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:51.467
to chew on it that think about.

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:52.101
If I had to ask each one of you

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:55.504
to give me just one suggestion

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.372
that you think would truly make

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.575
a difference on this campus and

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:03.479
all campuses. Just one. What

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:04.113
would it be and I'll start at

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.581
the far end- for that one that

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:06.181
you think would really make a

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:13.756
difference. I don't know

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:14.389
there's a lot but if you have a

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:17.426
no one is to say aha yes.

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.995
Definitely decreasing policing

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.964
on college campuses the what

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.300
decreasing policing on college

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:27.402
campuses what is that me so-

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.471
recently and my campus

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.306
particularly we've increased-

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.442
policing so having more police

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.477
officers on campus which I

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.479
personally do not feel safe

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.113
knowing that they're on every

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.383
corner- patrolling and- keeping

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.452
us safe for emergencies in

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:45.854
reality- they don't do that.

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:49.291
The just. Create more fear

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:49.858
within- a lot of black and

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.827
brown students- especially

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.295
around the college of ethnic

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:53.929
studies which mostly a lot of

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.964
our black and brown students

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:57.633
are located- there mostly

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.568
patrolling that area more

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.303
aggressively. So okay would

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.407
would would would down. What

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.008
would and because often times

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.776
the only can one way and all of

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.645
us have that. What would- what

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:13.549
would create. A safer or

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.284
feeling of a safer environment

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.653
that a police officer. Because

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.253
normally in our culture that

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.290
talks about safety so what

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:23.559
would what would it look like-

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.059
would be hiring a more

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.961
counselors a social workers

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.629
would be- you know I I'm not

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:31.567
sure. That's why I'm asking you

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:32.167
what would it look like if we

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:33.468
were to talk about. Of

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.671
decreasing the number of police

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:39.575
officers on campus. In order to

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:40.175
make you feel safe what would

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.810
we increase. Definitely more

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:43.545
counselors I know at my school

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.514
in particular there's one

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.382
counselor for every thirteen

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.618
thousand students- which is a

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.453
lack of counseling for a lot of

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.054
our black and brown full. On

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.891
our campus so definitely

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.326
increasing more counselors.

01:14:57.392 --> 01:15:01.797
Alright what would you have as

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:02.431
as the number one thing keeping

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:03.799
because I was amazed at some of

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:04.366
the things you step faculty

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.934
were doing which I consider to

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:09.705
be- as a former faculty are

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:10.272
still faculty merit is on

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.773
campus I would consider to be

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.542
just one of the worst things

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.577
that could ever happen would be

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:17.613
for a faculty it'd give

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:18.180
misinformation but also to

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:21.316
create an environment where

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:23.518
other students who feel. That

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.654
they have the right to have a

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:26.154
negative attitude toward

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:29.625
someone as I me. We have a

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.493
greater responsibility than

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.127
that so as a faculty member I

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.462
find it very difficult what do

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:34.029
you think would be the one

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.864
thing that that could happen

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.599
that could. On this campus as

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.635
well as a community college

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:40.202
what December Dino at the

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:41.637
community college. What would

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.739
you think would be important to

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.307
as one thing that would that

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.809
you think would really make a

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.611
difference for is for Islamic

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:53.482
students- so. I think honestly

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:55.951
when you look at the data from

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.419
UC Berkeley specifically. Most

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.388
of the vast majority over 85%

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.556
of our faculty and staff are

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.859
white. So that just having that

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:06.028
you know that they are going to

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.030
be partnering with

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.498
organizations that are harmful.

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:11.733
To you know whether it's black

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.401
students whether it's most some

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:13.302
students whether it's not next

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:15.771
units- do used. It if we don't

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.572
have diverse faculty and staff

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.841
they will never understand the

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:20.409
issues that we are talking

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:21.410
about they will never

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:23.912
understand. The daily you know

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:24.546
issues that we deal with those

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:27.416
students the fact that the UC

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:28.016
system has made no effort in

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:31.954
trying to. Hire more staff that

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:32.487
is more diverse and more

01:16:32.554 --> 01:16:35.424
actually knowledgeable on these

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:39.728
issues the fact that. I was so

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:43.932
excited to take. Okay as a

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.634
language class because my

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.669
family is from focus on and

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:48.236
would do is our- national

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:49.705
language. I was excited to take

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:51.640
that course until I realized

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:52.240
the professors the white male

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:57.746
from Texas. Okay soul and this

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:59.548
is no disrespect to you know

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:00.148
however much you might have

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.483
study that language or anything

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.017
like that but when he's

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.719
referencing Bollywood in India.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.487
To try to teach the national

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.090
language of August on is very.

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:11.326
Just I don't I don't I mean

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:11.893
yeah it's very uncomfortable

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.829
and the fact that you know. The

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:14.463
fact that we don't have diverse

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.764
faculty the fact that our

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:16.298
faculty are working with

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:20.068
programs like C. V. E. the fact

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:20.635
that we have to ask are you

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:21.403
know so. School in

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.605
administration not to partner

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.774
with organizations that help

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.442
ice or other organizations our

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:28.043
students are continuing to be

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:31.646
targeted not just within the

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:32.180
classroom but you've been

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:32.748
outside the classroom when

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:35.484
these professors. Are working

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.084
with organizations that don't

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.753
see us as human. Thank you

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.788
Dominic would you would be the

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:41.623
one thing that I'm gonna ask us

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.257
all to be brief because I know

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.159
we've got another panel to

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:49.464
hear- what would be the one

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.032
thing you think what. Would

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:53.468
help. Refill pop tune. Sounds

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:56.004
good okay what about you Marin.

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:56.605
Well I want to take the other

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:57.706
side of woods idea was saying

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.341
that we need to make a greater

01:17:59.408 --> 01:17:59.941
effort to recruit and retain

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:03.345
blacks across the issues the

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.647
seasons and the UC system and

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.050
the reason for that is because

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:08.683
if we don't have students today

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.353
we won't have a diverse faculty

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:11.953
for tomorrow we're trying to

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.688
pull faculty out of a- that is

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.857
limited to begin with and so

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.526
we've got a began to make our

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:20.529
pool- better and that will take

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.265
a- systemic changes. Over a

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:25.600
long period of time I need to

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:26.234
be a trend actively engage in

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:29.504
aye second- what my colleague

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:32.207
says is without repeal two oh

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:32.774
nine we already know we're

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.408
gonna keep hearing that we are

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.510
limited we can't do it so hill

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:36.144
told nine but we need to have

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:39.581
more- you know a real effort I

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.483
have twenty years in human

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:42.117
resources I don't know how it

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:45.353
is that we keep saying to all

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:45.921
nine is the issue. I hired

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:47.489
black full all the time and it

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:51.526
wasn't discriminatory but- here

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:57.332
we are. Among. Two things arm

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:57.999
our campus loves money and they

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.734
left making promises so I would

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:00.335
ask that the state legislator

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:00.936
in conjunction with lieutenant

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:01.770
governor. To work with the UC

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.438
regents body to have a plan.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.707
That actually- has some and

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.576
goals with the time frame. That

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:09.244
when our campus makes promises

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:09.811
that they keep them and ask

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.880
these- problems they're being

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.782
audited. And our campuses are

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.584
actively being- investigated

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.886
ease maybe two years three

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.688
years four years. To make sure

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:20.322
that they're making a promises

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:23.358
because right now- the only

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:23.959
organizations on our campus

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.594
they're doing good work like

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.161
bridges. Which recoup some

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.696
attended by students and other

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.498
under percent minority groups

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.566
our house in a closet- you know

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:33.502
for the former student union.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.102
And they were supposed to have

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:37.405
an actual center- into in

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:38.073
nineteen were here right now we

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.641
don't have that. So it be nice

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.576
for the state government's

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.345
their auditing and start

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:43.912
wondering where's the money

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:44.513
going to. Sounds good sounds

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:45.914
great. Want to thank all of

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:51.620
you- just so you know that- two

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.220
oh nine is not that far from

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:52.721
our conversation in the

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:53.622
capital. At least my

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.557
conversation so- we will be

01:19:55.624 --> 01:20:01.396
making decisions about that.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.030
Fairly soon. But thank you very

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:15.610
much for your your your. Thank

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.712
you we're going to have our-

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:18.346
are put second panel which is

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.848
you see. See issue and

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.416
community colleges. The talk

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.050
about the progress an update of

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:23.818
on- dial on recommendations

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:24.452
from the twenty fourteen campus

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:25.020
climate recommendations and

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.422
responses to the rise. In

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.491
racial hate incidents- it's

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.359
quite a challenge on these

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.027
campuses we know to try to meet

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.895
those needs and to bring the

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.697
change that so central. To all

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.732
of our campuses- in some of

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.634
made more progress than others

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:41.836
and some. Makes progress

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.505
forward and then someone of the

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.607
gets pulled back- it's not easy

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.809
to- try to bring change on

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.344
campus that they most of you

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:51.413
realize that. So we have with

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.515

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.417

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.664
Improving the campus climate

for all of our students faculty

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:21.569

the students speakers for

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.471
sharing their perspectives. You

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:23.905
will experience as a

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:27.575
recommendations. We can all

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.109
action that acts of heat

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.711
intolerance discrimination or

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.880
bias whether directed at

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.782
individual or group have long

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.750
term effects on the believe our

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:37.852
students to learn and thrive.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.854
For faculty teach effectively

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.756
conduct world class research

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.925
and of our staff to work and

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:47.429
contribute productively. It is

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.063
our responsibility both at the

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.831
system level one of the

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.800
campuses to do whatever we can

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:53.768
to improve our campus climate.

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:56.037
As president Nepal tunnel said

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.806
in two thousand fourteen.

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:00.008
Respect and inclusion requires

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.676
a constant attention Militar

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:05.447
used to community every student

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:05.914
every professor every

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.384
administrator every staff

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:13.688
member everybody every day. UC

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.423
campuses develop action plans

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.360
in response to our two thousand

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:18.960
thirteen system wide campus

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:19.561
climate survey. But those

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.696
action plans could not

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.832
anticipate the signet Vance but

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.700
a fundamentally shifted the

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.602
nature of discourse in colleges

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:28.169
and universities across the

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:33.475
nation. These events of course

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.744
include the two thousand

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:36.344
sixteen presidential election

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:37.612
the rise of the all right. For

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.280
your actions to rescind doc

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:41.383
grow in anti immigrant policies

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.551
outside groups expressing their

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.085
view points directly on UC

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:47.756
campuses. So if asked whether

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.557
it's been harder for

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.493
universities to quote unquote

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.962
manage campus climate I would

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:57.399
say absolutely yes. With that

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:58.066
in mind I will now summarize so

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.901
the most recent system wide

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:03.471
efforts to prove campus climate.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:04.105
Those efforts are intended to

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.774
complement and support efforts

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.742
of the campus level some of

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.477
which will be described by my

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.044
colleague UC Berkeley vice

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:13.548
chancellor Oscar newborn. First

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.550
starting in spring two thousand

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:17.752
seventeen UC campuses were the

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.387
scene of a number of bands.

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:21.523
Incidences or demonstrations

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:23.525
their chartered Ted

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:24.025
marginalized groups or

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.627
individuals. Resulted in campus

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.896
unrest and negatively affecting

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:29.531
campus climate as you will

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.800
recall the events in UC's

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:35.503
responses to them. Destructive

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:36.004
local and national media

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.874
attention. To guide officials

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.476
from the campus is a managing

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.445
the best of this kind we

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.580
develop tools and training that

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:46.114
help caps in ministry- is

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.549
police chiefs diversity

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.684
officers campus council lawyers

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.619
indeed of students. To

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:52.120
coordinate and maintain

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:53.788
consistency with respect to the

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.723
university's position on free

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.059
speech. Time place and manner

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.395
roles protest management

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:05.633
protocols responses. To acts of

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.504
hate or tolerance this includes.

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.071
To prepare for in marriage

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:10.672
major incidences like the kind

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:13.775
I described. Since this time of

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.443
the campuses are far better

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.545
equipped and prepared to both

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:18.112
respond to these kinds of

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.647
events while also taking

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:20.215
ongoing proactive steps to

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:20.748
maintain a positive campus

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:23.751
climate. A second example is

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:27.555
the UC policing task force. Two

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:28.089
thousand eighteen present

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.457
president appall tunnel.

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:31.526
Created a prison presidential

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:32.060
task force to examine the

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:35.296
investigative practices. In the

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:35.930
use of force related policies

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.999
and training of the UC police

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.701
departments. This was in an

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.569
effort to strengthen the

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:45.507
departments practices. And

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:46.007
their relationships and

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:47.442
interactions with the community.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:47.876
Some key task force

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.711
recommendations included. The

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.946
creation of a uniform complaint

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.449
process at all you see two

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:57.585
locations including an intake

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:58.019
system for reporting

01:25:58.086 --> 01:26:01.456

they're all personal by cities

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:30.511
and then they will also learn

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.646
how they can influence behavior

people to respond to acts of

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:55.470
intolerance by hate. At the

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:57.872
same time. Keeping constant

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.641

speak on this important panel

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:20.361
on behalf of UC Berkeley for

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.829
thought like to say like to

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.665
thank the students for once

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.667
again affirming how they are

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.835
always on the right two sides

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.570
of the issues so I really

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.506
appreciate that- also like to

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:33.908
thank Ahmed for- acknowledging

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.610
the land were in- that's

01:28:35.677 --> 01:28:36.177
something that we should

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:39.347
always. Be in our conscience

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:41.649
around not just being gassed in

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.818
the land of the- wake me Aloni

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.787
but also- to understand that

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:46.354
the work that we do should

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:51.526
always be in honor of the

01:28:51.592 --> 01:28:52.160
histories of. The or people who

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:55.863
are here. The issue of campus

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.765
climate as it relates to campus

01:28:57.832 --> 01:28:58.399
safety protocols and procedures

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.701
the prevailing and persistent

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:00.201
topic on the nursing the

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:03.805
California campus. At Berkeley.

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.007
A clear indication that we are

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.975
not where we need to be on this

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.544
deeply important issue. In

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.679
order to get there we must

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.448
first articulate what that

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.850
there is. That there is to be a

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.685
place where institutional

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.654
excellence is founded on

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:21.489
principles of belonging where

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.524
the full humanity of each and

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.793
every member of our campus

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.328
community is recognized and

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.831
respected. And invited to print

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:30.331
transform the academic

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:33.401
enterprise the research the

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:34.001
student experience university

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:37.839
structures. Practices and more

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:41.576
in a process of co creation.

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:42.210
But before we can get there we

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:42.744
must acknowledge the tent

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.178
challenges and histories that

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:45.546
have pave the road to the

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.348
president. One of enormous

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.617
achievements as well as one of

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:53.654
systemic marginalization. Like

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.523
most institutions. And

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.725
structures in this nation UC

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.994
Berkeley have was established

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.562
as the White serving

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.698
institution or is it because

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:04.198
existence. And over its

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.900
existing has promoted whiteness

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.869
at the cultural norms and

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.570
standards in which its

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.138
institutional excellence is

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:13.708
couch. These historical and

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.643
experience of facts are

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:16.244
antithetical to our principles

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.678
of community and are valuing of

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.680
diversity. We must be

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.449
intentional and making

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.584
institutional and cultural

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.520
shift that support belonging

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.855
beyond the norm in support of

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:31.526
non white groups specifically

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:32.059
and marginalized targeted

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.661
communities in general. My

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:35.596
remarks will therefore examine

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.732
the campus climate and campus

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.667
experience data of under

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.936
represented a marginalized

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.704
groups through this lance. As

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.706
my colleague Liz Holly

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.809
misstated the entire UC system

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.011
took a UC campus climate survey

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:55.349
awhile back. At UC Berkeley in

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:57.685
nineteen in two thousand

01:30:57.752 --> 01:30:58.319
thirteen our data indicated the

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.255
following. 25% of respondents

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:03.624
reported that they personally

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:04.125
experience exclusionary

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.860
behavior ranging from

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.662
intimidation isolation and

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.497
exclusion to hostility. A

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.732
higher percentage of ethnic and

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.333
racial under presented groups

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.634
especially African Americans

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.469
reported experiencing

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:18.506
exclusionary behavior based on

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:19.774
the racial identity as compared

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:20.274
to non under represented

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:23.477
minorities. A higher percentage

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.580
AB T. Q. plus and persons with

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.481
disabilities reported

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.650
experiencing exclusionary

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:30.184
behavior at their to other

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.053
groups. A higher percentage of

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:33.888
staff respondents reported

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.590
experiencing exclusionary

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.859
behavior based on their

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:38.459
position status as compared to

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.696
faculty. UC Berkeley took

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.531
immediate action to think

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:44.098
through the best ways to

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.700
address our specific campus

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:49.370
climate issues here represent

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:49.971
some north now know where the

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:53.641
actions. The African American

other under represented at that

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.457

concerning police- policing on

with broader national finding

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:31.478
of perception of police.

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.681
Initiated by student activism

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.583
following incidents of police

consistent with these

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:43.557
preliminary results. The UC why

students staff and faculty. I

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.448
personally think that this is

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:08.048
the number one issue on campus

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:11.518

The type of change that we are

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.778
discussing takes time resources

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.213
and shared accountability among

01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:09.810

thank the students who spoke so

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:16.016
eloquently- earlier- I'm going

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.418
to update you on the steps of

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:19.787
the CSU. Campuses have taken

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:22.022
and continue to take to improve

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.857
campus I met since the

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.492
committee's hearings in two

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:26.026
thousand fourteen and its

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:27.928
subsequent report I feel like I

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.797
have a lot of good news to

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:31.532
report but when I think about

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.767
what the student said I realize

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:34.401
that we really still have a lot

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:37.671
more work to do. A my chance

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.440
office colleagues in academic

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.675
and student affairs and equity

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:42.309
and Percy regret their unable

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:44.311
to be here today- they're

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:46.013
conducting a three days system

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.614
wide training for campus

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:48.215
administrators on California

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:50.184
state. Percy processes for

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:53.454
responding to and investigating

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.622
discrimination and harassment

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:56.223
complaint so I guess that's a

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:56.790
good reason that they're not

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:59.526
here. My testimony today will

01:39:59.593 --> 01:39:59.993
include nation that my

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.662
colleagues have provided to me.

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:03.397
And I hope that I'll be able to

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:05.332
answer any follow up questions

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:07.668
but if not we'd be happy to

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:08.235
provide further information

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:11.438

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:27.521
native American students.

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.556
Nearly one third of CSU

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:31.759
students are the first in their

01:40:31.825 --> 01:40:33.394
family to attend college.

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.696
Because of this the CSU is

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.765
committed and determined to

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.700
create a welcoming environment

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:40.300
for all members of the campus

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:43.670
community. We have increased

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.506
our efforts on student touch

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.808
points through a student

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:48.375
centers and other affinity

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:49.910
groups to improve a sense of

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:50.511
belonging for students of all

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:53.814
backgrounds. Student affairs

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.716
staff student life and

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:57.518
development staff academic

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.820
counselors including staff from

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.855
E. O. P. foster youth programs

01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:03.724
and dream centers are in

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:04.291
constant dialogue with our

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:05.959
students so that our students

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:07.861
experiences can inform our

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:09.563
programming and trainings and

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.999
so that we can continue to

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:12.599
improve our campus climate for

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:15.803
all. Our programming is varied

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:19.440
in substance and modality

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.442
includes diversity awareness

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:23.544
and campus orientation sessions

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:24.044
multi cultural welcome

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:26.013
receptions for newly enrolled

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.948
students and work with their

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.516
student leadership. On

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.885
approaches that they believe

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:32.519
would best serve their fellow

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:35.422
students. Campus forums to

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.357
discuss campus climate online

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:37.858
training for faculty and

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.660
students and also campus

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.929
climate surveys which more than

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.730
half of our can campus does

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:44.364
have conducted in the last five

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:47.901
years. The goal of orientation

01:41:47.968 --> 01:41:49.870
is to help new students become

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.438
familiar with their campus this

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.574
is their new home. To have them

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.043
interact with and meet new

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:57.544
people and to build a network

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.346
of friends and support to learn

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.248
about resources and to gain

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:01.748
knowledge of university

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:05.352
policies and procedures. Many

01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:05.786
of our campuses are

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.654
experimenting with approaches

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:09.623
that involve peer to peer

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.492
discussions for example at San

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.360
Jose state the chief diversity

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.729
officer combines presentations

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:17.531
with small group discussions

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:19.833
led by students. And finds that

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.467
this approach allows for more

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.768
intimate and substantive

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.871
discussion of complex issues

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.639
surrounding diversity and

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:27.574
identities of race ethnicity

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:29.376
class religion sexual

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:31.845
orientation gender identity and

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:35.682
immigration status. Each CSU

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:36.183
campus has at least one

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:37.918
cultural program club

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:39.953
organization or center on its

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.555
campus many have more.

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:43.891
Depending on such as each

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.792
campus has key staff overseeing

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.594
its efforts to ensure a safe

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:49.496
welcoming and inclusive

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:51.565
environment for all students.

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.600
Eighteen of our twenty three

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:54.167
campuses have opened dream

01:42:54.234 --> 01:42:55.736
centers that provide a touch

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.771
point and support to

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.540
undocumented students and

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:01.808
allies. Even campuses that do

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:03.510
not have an actual center

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:05.579
provide support and have at

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:06.179
least one point of contact for

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:09.716
students. The CSU will use some

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.451
of the one time basic needs

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:13.587
funding in this year's budget

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:14.187
to create partnerships with

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:15.589
community and other external

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.958
organizations so is to increase

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:20.027
and leverage whenever possible

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:21.828
wraparound services available

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.864
to our students here are some

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:27.601
examples of our work. We're

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.235
developing ongoing partnerships

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:29.703
with community organizations

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.905
that have a tradition of

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.373
helping populations

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:33.941
experiencing basic needs and

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:37.411
security. We are connecting

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:38.011
students with community case

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:39.780
managers who have knowledge and

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:41.949
expertise in accessing safety

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:43.817
net resources at our counseling

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.752
centers we offer personal

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.854
counselling sessions to address

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:49.723
family and relationships sexual

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:51.425
identity suicide and other

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:53.961
psychological needs and our

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.662
counseling centers also offer

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.631
support groups focus on gender

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.700
cultural groups and sexuality.

01:43:59.766 --> 01:44:01.568
The service delivery model is

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:03.437
extremely important to

01:44:03.503 --> 01:44:05.539
empowering students to take

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:06.073
advantage of mental health

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:07.741
services. The committee's

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:09.710
report noted the importance of

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.812
dis aggregating certain data

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:13.547
emphasizing that providing

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.449
disaggregated data for the

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:15.949
fifty ethnic or national

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:18.085
origins that have in the past

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:20.153
been categories as one group.

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.555
Asian Pacific islanders will

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.824
help to demonstrate the

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.459
disparities that exist between

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:27.694
them. I am pleased to report

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.796
that since two thousand

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:30.397
eighteen we reported on such

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:30.931
dis aggregated data on our

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:33.867
system wide website. We're also

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:36.203
collecting data with respect to

01:44:36.269 --> 01:44:39.773
LGBT Q. plus community- for

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.340
example the cal state apply

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.708
application and the student

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.645
self service portal. Invite

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:45.545
applicants and students to

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:47.848
provide information about their

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:49.383
sexual identity and sexual or

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:51.618
Asian. The chancellor's office

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.052
is also developing

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:53.754
modifications to our common

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.357
common management system to

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:57.991
help campuses implement the use

01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:03.497
of preferred pronouns. As the

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:04.131
state of California and the CSU

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:05.832
have rebounded from the

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:08.301
recession we've also improved

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:11.471
our- the hiring of tenure track

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:12.139
faculty and it's the data shows

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:15.876
that it is more diverse but

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:16.476
there's still more work to be

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:19.846
done. I'm not gonna talk about

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:21.948
the anti bias trainings because

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.650
Liz has already described

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:25.719
those- and just in closing I

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.654
want to say that university

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.656
campuses our marketplace of

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:32.092
ideas and it's important that

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.460
our community sustain a healthy

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:34.061
appetite for debate. And even

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:37.564
for disagreement. The CSU does

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:40.067
not and cannot restrict who was

01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:42.002
invited to speak on our

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.570
campuses based on the content

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:46.206
of their speech. Provided that

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.674
the speech is lawful and I have

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:48.308
to tell you that hate speech is

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:51.945
lawful. Not something we

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:52.579
welcome but it's not prohibited

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:57.684
by law. Controversial speakers

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.386
present many challenges that

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.555
drain economic and human

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:03.490
resources on our campuses this

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.492
is important work and we must

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.159
safeguard the safety and rights

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:08.261
of our entire community to be

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:11.465
heard and to dissent even when

01:46:11.531 --> 01:46:15.469
speech causes pain and anger.

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:16.103
We also work hard to teach our

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:17.537
students and other of our

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:20.040
community that the best way to

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:21.475
respond to speech with which we

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:25.512
disagree. Is with more speech.

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:26.146
We owe it to our students to

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.748
lead by example and help them

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:28.348
learn how to speak and dissent

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:35.722
effectively. The university's

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:37.390
response to incidents of hate.

01:46:37.457 --> 01:46:39.593
What happened. And whether the

01:46:39.659 --> 01:46:41.561
incident involved more than

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:44.264
protected speech the rules can

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:44.765
seem very technical at

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:45.966
sometimes infuriating that

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:47.634
individuals are not held

01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:49.603
accountable for expressing

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:50.237
before views that because a lot

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.738
of pain to members of our

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.007
community. We might not be able

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.276
to undertake formal discipline

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:56.910
but that does not stop us from

01:46:56.977 --> 01:46:57.911
appropriately responding to

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.746
incidents to ensure and

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:01.815
maintain a safe environment

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:02.382
that demands compassion and

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:05.986
respect. Campus professionals

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:08.321
including bias response team

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:09.689
serve a very important role in

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.625
safeguarding our community

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.627
values provided they do not

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:17.631
create confusion about where to

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:18.098
report and how to seek

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.500
supportive measures.

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:21.368
Universities are microcosm of

01:47:21.434 --> 01:47:23.870
the complex world in which we

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.405
live and we're deeply committed

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:27.507
to make imposes an inclusive

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:28.141
welcoming learning environment

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.910
that's a safe home for all of

01:47:29.976 --> 01:47:33.480
our students we thank you for

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:34.014
your support during these

know that's what we want for

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.747
all of you for all of our

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:29.716
students across the state we

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:30.249
want our students to feel

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:31.984
comfortable to feel safe and to

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.686
feel like they have a for

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:35.755
media. A family that's looking

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:37.790
out for them and that make sure

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:39.559
they succeed and so I'm here to

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:41.761
mention some of the efforts

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:43.629
taken up by the California

01:56:43.696 --> 01:56:47.633
community college system. In

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.134
twenty fourteen we begin

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:48.801
funding what is called student

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:49.902
equity throughout the one

01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:51.738
hundred and fifteen community

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:53.706
colleges. Every college

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:56.042
received an allocation in order

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:57.510
to make changes to our

01:56:57.577 --> 01:56:59.579
practices to dismantle

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:00.213
predominately white institution

01:57:00.279 --> 01:57:03.616
characteristics. And I'll I'll

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:04.217
mention at the chief student

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:07.653
services officer level we

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.655
welcome to that with open arms

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:12.024
for example last year we hosted

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:15.395
a conference and Dr Sean Harper

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:17.497
was our keynote speaker. This

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:18.064
year we have doctor G. look

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:19.799
good and doctors here brown

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.701
McNair her new book is called

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:25.938
from equity talk to act you

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:29.776
walk. And we look forward to

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:30.410
that. I work at Pasadena City

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:33.646
College and a month ago we were

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:34.247
featured in an article online

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:35.748
in political magazine. And we

01:57:35.815 --> 01:57:37.550
were featured for our work in

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:40.052
racial equity specifically- we

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:41.921
closed racial equity gaps for

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:43.723
Latino Latina and let the next

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.992
students by ten percentage

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.794
points in less than four years.

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.562
How did we do that. We

01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:51.864
implemented an implicit bias

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:53.499
training in our equal

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.868
employment opportunity training

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:57.737
which is mandatory for anybody

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:58.337
who wants to serve on a hiring

01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:01.707
committee. Instead of doing

01:58:01.774 --> 01:58:03.543
legalese and death by power

01:58:03.609 --> 01:58:05.812
point from a legal perspective

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:09.549
for compliance purposes only.

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:10.216
We used it as an opportunity to

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:11.784
help people understand and

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:13.753
unpacked their own unconscious

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.222
bias when they're going through

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:18.191
applications and identifying

01:58:18.257 --> 01:58:19.625
candidates to hire. In doing so

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:23.296
we've hired 15% more African

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:25.665
American and Latin X. faculty

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:27.934
on our campus. Additionally we

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.404
implemented new faculty aye.

01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:33.873
Your long new faculty seminar

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.608
which all new faculty

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:37.677
participate in and it's based

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.779
on cultural competence cultural

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:41.547
relevance and cultural humility

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:43.749
in the classroom. We partnered

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:45.718
with doctor a stellar and

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:47.920
Simone and over four hundred of

01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:48.387
our faculty staff and

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.922
administrators on campus

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:53.392
participated. In learning

01:58:53.459 --> 01:58:55.661
equity mind this we developed

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:57.730
an equity data dashboard for

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.665
our college than anybody in the

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:01.734
public can see you can identify

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:03.769
our racial equity gaps down to

01:59:03.836 --> 01:59:07.840
the course of all. In doing so

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:09.642
we also it stirred three racial

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:11.744
campus climate surveys one that

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.646
was mentioned at the beginning

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:15.581
our session today by Dr Charles

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.416
Davis that was developed by Dr

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.452
Sean Harper. The national

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:19.986
assessment for collegiate

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.754
campus climate second we

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:24.056
administered a survey that was

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.925
developed by two faculty

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:27.760
members at San Diego State

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:29.829
University doctors look word

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:31.831
and Frank Harris the community

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:33.566
college success measure.

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:35.635
Finally we administered the

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:37.937
higher education labor city

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:39.305
survey and the head survey

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:41.607
provided us with more insight

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:42.275
what do we do with the data we

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.676
allowed it to inform our

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:45.745
professional development plans.

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:47.947
Are hiring plans and to

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:49.815
essentially inform what

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:53.819
students need from us on our

01:59:53.886 --> 01:59:54.353
campus to feel a sense of

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.788
belonging. I believe that we

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:57.557
can continue to close our

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.559
racial equity gaps by

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:00.192
dismantling practices that were

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:01.761
not designed for our students

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:03.563
in the first place. And it is

02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:05.898
very possible to continue

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:07.533
moving the needle on racial

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.067
equity thank you very much

02:00:08.134 --> 02:00:12.038
thank you. I thank all of you

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:15.508
for your- presentations-

02:00:15.575 --> 02:00:16.075
obviously our campuses have

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:19.645
been. Engaged very busy in in

02:00:19.712 --> 02:00:21.647
addressing these issues

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:23.649
obviously at different levels.

02:00:23.716 --> 02:00:26.152
Of June- and I know our time is

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:27.820
up basically but I wanted to

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:29.789
make sure those in the audience

02:00:29.855 --> 02:00:31.357
had an opportunity to make a

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.693
statement- but- just a couple

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:37.530
of things that- that I will I

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:38.197
would say and you don't have to

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.832
respond any ninety we have to

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.701
respond to today but- over the

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.603
last five years using a lot of

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:45.304
activities that have occurred-

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:45.838
you know a lot of program

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.873
development a lot of resources

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:51.544
put into it- efforts to hire a

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.613
different individuals. Up I

02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:55.481
assume that in this process

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:57.850
there's also an assessment of

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.719
the effectiveness of will be

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:01.420
doing a and I say that because

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:03.656
I just had a an audit report

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:05.391
today that came out of

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.693
concerning. Local control

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.595
funding for me one of the main

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:10.196
things was no is not effort

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:13.399
sensing within our done is the

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:13.933
fact that we have lots of

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.935
activity. Of lots of programs

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.770
lots of goals and objectives

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:20.139
and yet we don't stop and say

02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:21.841
that is ineffective. Let's not

02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:23.876
do it again this is effective

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:29.482
let's do more of it- and I

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:30.049
think that's that's that's

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:31.751
because when I when I go to

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:35.588
hear a lot of activity. And I

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:37.623
would encourage I know it's

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.525
hard these programs going but

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:42.128
with. As an object system for

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:42.728
you to be a certain period of

02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:43.329
time without with what you're

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:45.598
doing and then be honest in the

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:47.700
in assessing of which one of

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:48.501
these actually **** which one a

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:49.769
light. Would actually works to

02:01:49.835 --> 02:01:51.671
accomplish these goals I think

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:59.478
would be helpful in. In

02:01:59.545 --> 02:02:00.079
determining how you spend the

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:11.557
future dollars or future. First

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:13.893
so the question becomes you

02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:15.428
know with the accountability

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:15.961
for the programs that are

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:17.663
there. Accountability for

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.732
faculty for of changing

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:21.734
behavior in a faculty- are we

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.669
talking about if you did

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:26.105
utilizing. That information as

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:26.639
a part of assessment and

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:29.809
evaluation of faculty determine

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:30.409
tenure promotion. Those kinds

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:33.412
of things- you know I mean

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:34.046
where are we in terms of the

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.681
seriousness of it because we

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:37.616
can do a lot of programs. But

02:02:37.683 --> 02:02:38.284
until we begin to crack through

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:40.152
the real difficult task which

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:43.556
is making sure that. Not only

02:02:43.622 --> 02:02:44.123
we say what we want but we

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:45.925
enforce what we want. We

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:47.793
demonstrate that and I think

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:48.394
that was some of the comments

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:49.628
with the students here- they

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:51.864
don't necessarily feel see the

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:55.534
demonstration of it- especially

02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:57.536
if they've got. A police

02:02:57.603 --> 02:02:58.104
officer whose hard over and

02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:59.672
over and over again in the

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.807
fact. Who continues teach over

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:03.542
over over again and I've been a

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.544
personal committees will people

02:03:05.611 --> 02:03:06.145
have love people because they

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:07.446
both books. But yet the

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:07.947
students comments were

02:03:08.013 --> 02:03:09.648
absolutely damaging and

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:11.917
horrible that they were saying

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:13.753
screaming through the

02:03:13.819 --> 02:03:21.427
valuations and these. Are

02:03:21.494 --> 02:03:22.061
people some of our students who

02:03:22.128 --> 02:03:29.468
got aids I had a in a class.

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:31.837
I'm and as we kept saying that

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:32.304
inner Bennett and the

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:35.441
conversation was. She was he

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:35.875
did the best book in

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:39.545
anthropology this year. Okay

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:41.447
but the students are saying

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.482
he's horrible he's terrible you

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:44.083
know don't put you back in the

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.618
classroom again and we can't do

02:03:45.684 --> 02:03:48.020
it because our standards didn't

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.688
really factory and their needs

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:50.122
it factored into the

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:51.724
institutions. Desire to have

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:53.726
greater ratings for whatever

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.360
who knows grants and so forth

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:55.728
and so on self I think you know

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:57.429
beginning to ask the question

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.665
okay when. We've got these we

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:01.400
obviously have these issues you

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:03.669
know that of the year what we

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:09.675
do is a system. Are the but

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:11.644
those are hard questions that

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:12.211
have to be passed in their

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:13.612
hearts things to implement. You

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:15.781
know I'm not naive to believe

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.883
it that when you start crack in

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:18.417
it. Professor tenure and

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:19.852
promotion it should be dig into

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:23.355
the heart of the institution-

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:25.424
which may be cold in itself but

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:26.058
none the less is the it's at

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.660
the heart of the institution.

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:29.495
So I hope that we get a chance

02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:31.430
to have a some conversation

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:32.031
like that I would love to see

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.799
what you're doing in terms of-

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:37.436
accountability. And what and

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:38.070
how far was going to get with

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:39.805
that with regard to that so I

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:41.807
really appreciate all of the

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:42.408
work that you're doing in the

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:43.843
evaluation is the year. But I

02:04:43.909 --> 02:04:45.711
given opportunity and what I

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:47.680
would encourage each one of

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.748
you- if that particular things

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:51.851
that you think would be helpful

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.586
to others that you make sure

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:54.119
that our staff gets those

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:57.590
things in terms of. Doing

02:04:57.656 --> 02:05:01.794
because we. Do keep all that

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:02.361
mature. Will generate always

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:05.631
general. The I will one of the

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:06.198
few committees that. As an

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:07.867
assessment. Of our of things if

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:08.500
you could probably get. Of the

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:09.702
men the past. A lot of those

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:10.336
things do lead to legislation.

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:11.971
And that's what we want to make

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:12.571
sure that if the things we can

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:15.274
do. To support- encourage- I

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:17.443
know we did some things before

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:18.043
with faculty diversity and try

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.745
to make sure that was that was

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.714
being done. All and we've we've

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.049
done some funding in that area.

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:25.718
So that it target said in and

02:05:25.784 --> 02:05:26.318
helps in some way- that would

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.120
be I think extremely important.

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:29.822
For us to know that that is

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:31.523
that that's something that

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:33.726
would be helpful- we've often

02:05:33.792 --> 02:05:37.463
talked about a system system

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:38.097
wide assessment. Of like we do-

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:39.899
with- what is a separate when

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:43.335
trading everybody has to take

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:43.869
that. We have yet to in a

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:45.871
including. Players we have yet.

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:46.472
The same kind of thing on

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.140
racial issues. In terms of

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:49.675
training across the system I

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:51.377
know when I was chairman

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:53.646
department state. At the take I

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.246
don't know how many hours of.

02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:55.648
On the internet every. Every

02:05:55.714 --> 02:05:57.783
every. We don't have that with

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:59.618
regards to racial. Situations

02:05:59.685 --> 02:06:03.756
which says. That is important

02:06:03.822 --> 02:06:05.524
as sexual harassment probably

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:07.459
sell- and I'm just. So we need

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:07.993
to look at that and maybe

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:09.361
that's- we need to. Start

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:11.630
thinking about. In terms of

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:12.197
making sure our faculty- and

02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:13.832
administrators. That off their

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.567
minds. That they have to be a

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.736
conscious of that. As well as

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:19.638
other kinds of biases that

02:06:19.705 --> 02:06:23.342
exist- it just sends a message

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:25.344
that this is important it's

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:29.715
not. You know that. We can

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:33.552
invite up to have a comment to

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.921
make. Your comment is to be no

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:43.796
more than one. If you were a

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:45.898
time seven and someone close.

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:49.902
This to basically get a chance

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:50.436
to speak if you one of our

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:51.637
speakers opportunity talks of

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:52.304
the make you the latter one but

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:52.938
we want to make those if there

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:53.572
are any of you who would like

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:54.173
to have a one minute comment

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:55.441
please get in the line now so

02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:56.041
we get a sense of who's coming

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.710
once the line is form would

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:58.377
never have full jumping in line

02:06:58.444 --> 02:06:58.944
because it will be here all

02:06:59.011 --> 02:06:59.778
night gives us a sense of how

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.480
many more minutes we have to do

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:02.114
so would invite you to come to

02:07:02.181 --> 02:07:03.949
make your one minute statement-

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.951
and my staff you will will will

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:07.786
let you know when your time is

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:11.557
up. In terms of one minute

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:12.157
thank you. And please give us

02:07:12.224 --> 02:07:12.725
your name in the campus that

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:15.594
you're from. Hi my name is on

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:16.128
the Charlie a aye ten UC

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.730
Berkeley here. And I'm the

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:18.263
black community endorsed

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.665
elected official in student

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.800
government. I wanted to touch

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:22.434
on some of the things that some

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:23.635
of my colleagues had said

02:07:23.702 --> 02:07:25.371
earlier. First things first.

02:07:25.437 --> 02:07:25.971
And most importantly. Repeal

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.906
prop two oh nine. It affects

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:29.541
not only the affirmative

02:07:29.608 --> 02:07:30.175
action. Allowing students to

02:07:30.242 --> 02:07:31.877
attend universities. But also

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:33.746
retention programs. And after

02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:35.481
those students getting here.

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.081
Being able to have resources

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:37.716
and programs. Increase the

02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:38.250
amount of diverse faculty

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:39.918
because anti by straining could

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.820
only go so far. As a black

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:43.622
woman in the computer science.

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:44.189
Department I'm not going to

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:45.891
learn from another black woman

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.693
before I graduate. And that is

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:49.628
the problem. Increase the

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:50.229
amount of students space and

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:51.363
social cultural centers.

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.499
Increase state funding to the

02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:56.101
UC CSU NCC so they can better

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.569
support student programs. And

02:07:57.636 --> 02:07:59.438
scholarships. And most and

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:01.874
finally. Demilitarize the U.

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.742
CPD. Across all UC campuses

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:05.644
because no school need the bomb

02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:07.746
truck. No school need automatic

02:08:07.813 --> 02:08:09.214
machinery that shrink to kill.

02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:09.782
And bill you see should have

02:08:09.848 --> 02:08:11.417
students. Who don't feel

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:13.552
comfortable. On campus to

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:19.591
learn. Thank you. Thank. You

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:20.192
you did in fifty five seconds

02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:24.129
Hey EA. It's hard to follow my

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:24.763
name is a corner room here with

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:26.098
UC Berkeley I'm also ACC

02:08:26.165 --> 02:08:27.466
senator. Elected Burke campus

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:28.000
wellness- and SB S. H. R.

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:29.902
belated issue the basic needs.

02:08:29.968 --> 02:08:31.737
Are two things that I wanted to

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:32.337
highlight is that basic needs

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:33.672
is extremely important on

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:35.441
campus we have students. Who

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:37.609
are living in origins they

02:08:37.676 --> 02:08:38.243
sleep in our libraries they're

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:39.745
eating out of trash cans living

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:41.914
in vehicles like this is a

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.715
reality on our campus. Have you

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:44.283
seen this exacerbated with

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:45.784
students of color particularly

02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:47.853
black students on campus over

bring this to the forefront

very often but we don't

02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:01.667

times they get pushed out of

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:12.077
the system they're not given a

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:12.478
fair trial so also

02:09:12.544 --> 02:09:13.745
acknowledging that. And just

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.681

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:32.364
academia and the only way to do

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:32.965
this to support them thank you

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:47.646
About cal pipe alone of since I

have a lot of friends to go

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.948
there and I in fact almost went

02:09:50.015 --> 02:09:52.050
there- and their treatment of

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.886
blacks vans- recently there has

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:55.787
been a student action committee

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:57.823
formed- against the

02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:59.958
mistreatment and micrographs

and that black students are

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.662
facing the classroom for

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:04.296
example some of them don't feel

02:10:04.363 --> 02:10:05.564
welcome in residence halls- one

02:10:05.631 --> 02:10:07.799
person. There professor called

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.835

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:11.403
how our hair is- like almost

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:13.605

board in front of their dorm.

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:19.878
And just elevating their voices

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:21.713
and making sure that their

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:22.314
heard and that something is

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:23.682
being done to address this

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:25.584
issue because the street in a

02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:27.419
black student. Especially at

02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:31.523
somewhere like how point. Where

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:32.057
they're they're all these

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:39.631
initiatives is unacceptable.

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:40.299
Hello my name is Nathan my cell

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:42.301
I am a commissioner on

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:43.502
Berkeley's police review board-

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:46.038
I just read this also through

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:47.806
the UC Berkeley- often. Walk on

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.508
campus in my first week size

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:51.610
told her this was the number

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:52.244
one book universe in the world

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:53.645
the sundry times. I'm not sure

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:56.281
how you can be number one when

02:10:56.348 --> 02:10:56.848
you were the worst for black

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.083
students. Everyone there said

02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:59.551
it all the students sign for

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:01.853
that said it. We can more when

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.422
you walk around campus you off

02:11:03.488 --> 02:11:05.424
to see the- benefits a- what if

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:07.826
in this generation weaker

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:08.360
cancer what if we just our

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:09.628
generation. We solve this great

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:11.530
big problem well let's ask the

02:11:11.597 --> 02:11:13.665
same question when it comes to

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:15.500
racial equity in our campuses.

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:16.134
We can make big actions we can

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:17.903
do big change we can repeal

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:21.807

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:33.819
racial justice and equity at

02:11:33.885 --> 02:11:35.587

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:42.094
our students said. Today public

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.929
comment panel. We have a lot of

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:45.731
issues to have to. Walk

highlighted in that. We

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:56.308
continue to address these

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:57.476
issues because they have not

02:11:57.542 --> 02:11:59.611
been fixed. Are we see those

02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:01.747
effects still to the very very

02:12:01.813 --> 02:12:03.682
real. And so we look forward to

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:47.559
years and years under

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:48.060
represented communities

02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:49.695
marginalized communities on our

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:50.329
campuses have been fighting for

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:52.197
this for years. And years you

02:12:52.264 --> 02:12:53.598
see stern association has

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:54.266
supported this probably longer

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:55.934
than I have been alive so I'm

02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:57.536
calling on not just the

02:12:57.602 --> 02:12:59.504
legislature to take an active

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:00.138
role in repealing this. But on

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:01.540
members of our university

02:13:01.606 --> 02:13:03.742
leadership to call on this not

02:13:03.809 --> 02:13:04.242
just supported not just

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:05.744
supporter quietly but actively

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:08.347
and loudly demanded because it

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.614
because it is a critical part.

02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:13.552
Of solving our campus climate

02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:14.119
crisis on our campuses thank

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:17.489

all of you for coming today- I

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:21.660
wanna make sure we thank those

02:13:21.727 --> 02:13:23.562
of students who from UC

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:25.530
Berkeley. And from other

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:26.164
campuses and staff for allowing

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:29.601
us to hold a- hearing to today

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:30.135
and I want to thank the

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:31.436
committee members. And the

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:32.037
panelists who provided their

02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:33.872
testimony. Of sharing with us

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:37.509
updates and campus- efforts and

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:38.176
address the bias in the various

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:39.878
incidents that have occurred

02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:41.780
on. Campus it's always a

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:43.782
painful to me I. Reflect back

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.450
on the fact that it's been.

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:47.452
Fifty three years since I

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.421
entered as a freshman at UCLA.

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.890
And of many of the fears and

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:55.527
concerns and feelings of

02:13:55.594 --> 02:13:57.462
alienation and isolation. Was

02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:58.063
also felt by me fifty three

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:01.500
years ago as a freshman. Of the

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:02.134
probably the student population

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:03.802
has an grown much since then.

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:05.837
In terms of the percentage and

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.672
so it is a- somewhat

02:14:07.739 --> 02:14:09.307
disheartening after so many

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:11.410
years to. Still see that to on

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:13.745
our UC campuses- particularly-

02:14:13.812 --> 02:14:17.449
we still have the- the issues

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:19.985
in the concerns of the year and

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:20.619
obviously. Going to address it.

02:14:20.685 --> 02:14:21.720
When I have to dress because we

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:23.588
truly believe in it and fight

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:25.524
for it. A much more than of

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.793
give lip service in. Resources

02:14:27.859 --> 02:14:28.393
and what have you to it it's

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.895
more than money- money helps of

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:31.963
anything but it's more than

02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:33.899
money- is money is seldom

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:37.436
solves any problem with that.

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.905
When effort- to make it happen.

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:41.807

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:26.017
student interns. Anyone else at

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:27.686
lucky- there's lucky sitting

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:29.788
there okay they were in a

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:31.890
student interns in my office

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:37.362
that. Gave us huh. Neon is here.

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:39.464
Okay she's gonna think what I

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:39.998
want to thank all of the

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.967
student interns we've we've

02:15:42.033 --> 02:15:42.601
been very fortunate and blessed

02:15:42.667 --> 02:15:43.802
to have students who want to

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:45.537
work in our office to come an

02:15:45.604 --> 02:15:47.939
intern with us and- and it's a

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:50.008
really great experience one

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:53.845
think I met who was in my- my

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.514
young fellows. Program and

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.349
legislators in sac and San

02:15:57.415 --> 02:15:58.016
Diego when he's in high school

02:15:58.083 --> 02:15:59.918
so I see all of my children

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:01.620
scattered around the room- and

02:16:01.686 --> 02:16:03.588
that's a great thing- we hope

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:04.055
we've given them some

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:07.792
experiences in our office in I

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:11.596
forgot. My oldest student. My

02:16:11.663 --> 02:16:12.130
oldest student when I was

02:16:12.197 --> 02:16:13.331
younger and he was younger too.

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:13.999
But I always take pride in the

02:16:14.065 --> 02:16:16.001
fact that that my students to

02:16:16.067 --> 02:16:17.903
hopefully get more than- just a

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.738
textbook learning but hopefully

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:21.673
get lessons for life. And

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.173
that's what's a really

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.775
important because you can

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.710
always access. Textbook

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:26.244
material nowadays on the

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:29.648
internet- and did and rather

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:30.181
quickly but it's hard to

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:33.518
access. The things that not to

02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:34.185
learn with the things that you

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.787
feel. And that you know that

02:16:35.854 --> 02:16:37.455
have a tendency to guide your

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:39.724
life- recent incidents in

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:41.526
campus crime to remind us that

02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:42.193
the how much work is still to

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.762
be done. And how much we need

02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:45.830
each one of us to do that work-

02:16:45.897 --> 02:16:47.532
one students arrive on campus

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:49.401
they are welcome respected and

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:51.636
safe. Whatever their background

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:52.237
might be in is our hope that

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:53.538
that will always be. The in the

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:56.007
inside of the perspective that

02:16:56.074 --> 02:16:57.943
these campus hearings that we

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:59.644
have. This is when I often make

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:00.211
Sacramento will but we have

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:03.415
inserted situations- or

02:17:03.481 --> 02:17:05.483
celebrations. I remind them of

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:07.419
that the work that we do is

02:17:07.485 --> 02:17:09.888
forever. We always think that

02:17:09.955 --> 02:17:11.890
it'll in soon. That of that- as

02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:13.658
soon as we accomplish this

02:17:13.725 --> 02:17:15.627
everybody will be happy the

02:17:15.694 --> 02:17:17.529
world will be better. And

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.196
everybody will love and respect

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:19.497
the body heals but I remind

02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:25.370
everyone on the floor of the.

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:25.904
Assembly as well as those

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:27.505
throughout the cap. That.

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.441
Concept of racial inclusion

02:17:29.507 --> 02:17:30.041
respect dignity those things

02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:31.543
that are valuable. I like rare

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.077
flowers that have to be

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:33.545
constantly nurtured in water.

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:35.513
The love and attention. But

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.782
hatred. And discrimination. Is

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.851
a weed. I like most weeks it

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:43.488
grows best in that collect. And

02:17:43.555 --> 02:17:44.122
so as soon as you turn your

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.757
back on it and think you've

02:17:45.824 --> 02:17:46.324
accomplished something just

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:47.425
like in your own garden at

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:49.761
home. So as you put it in a

02:17:49.828 --> 02:17:50.328
look so pretty and you don't

02:17:50.395 --> 02:17:53.365
come back for a nother month.

02:17:53.431 --> 02:17:53.965
You will discover the weed is

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:56.001
wrong with that picture care

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:57.602
without your nurturing without

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:59.437
your attention. And the work

02:17:59.504 --> 02:18:01.506
becomes harder the second time

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:03.541
around. And so for all of us

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:04.175
this is the work. That has to

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:05.777
happen every day we have to be

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:07.879
conscious and sensitive to the

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.681
things that we say. That we see

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:11.683
that we do we have to put in

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:13.618
place policies that are

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.520
responsive to the needs. And as

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:17.555
those needs change we change

02:18:17.622 --> 02:18:19.557
policies to response to it. If

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:21.526
that's the outcome we want. We

02:18:21.593 --> 02:18:23.795
want a garden at is gorgeous

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:24.396
and beautiful and nurture and

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:25.730
inspiring. And it requires

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.732
constant attention. All the

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:31.569
time. If not we will have a

02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:32.170
world as we sometimes feel we

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:33.438
have. Feel would be. Because we

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:33.972
all decided the work was

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:35.840
finished. And we didn't water

02:18:35.907 --> 02:18:37.809
it again would impede into to

02:18:37.876 --> 02:18:39.811
it. And now it has over grown

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:44.582
us and we're upset. The only

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.183
thing we can do is get in once

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:49.988
again. Are rooted out. And pay

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:50.555
attention thank you so very

02:18:50.622 --> 02:19:05.637
much for coming
