THROUGH -- TWELVE SCHOOL FACILITIES AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL FOR PURPOSES OF POTENTIALLY ENDING INTO THE BUDGET IT'S ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE ISSUE NUMBER FIVE FIRST AND THEN WE WILL MOVE -- TO ISSUE NUMBER. ONE SIR REQUIRE PLEASE JOIN US. WE ARE ON PAGE SHOULD TWENTY EIGHT OF MY AGENDA. SIR PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR I I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A TALK ABOUT PROP FIFTY ONE IN FRONT OF YOU AND THE COMMITTEE TODAY ALSO AS A THANK YOU YOUR STAFF. FOR REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL IS WELL I IN -- BE -- QUITE QUICK -- BUT WANTED TO BE TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON WHY IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY PURPOSE AND YOU KNOW A BIPARTISAN COALITION OF MEMBERS FROM BOTH THE STATE SENATE.% IN THE ASSEMBLY. CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHEN THEY PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WHICH IS THE SCHOOL BY MEASURE. FOCUSES FOCUSING ON CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED IN SUPPORT OF INITIATIVE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO REBUILD AND MODERNIZE BECAME PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. TO START WITH SOME GOOD NEWS MISTER CHAIR WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS RECOMMENDED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION A PROP FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS IN ITS BUDGET. ALONG WITH AN ADDITIONAL TEN POSITIONS AT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- IN THESE. POSITIONS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE BACK LOVER REQUEST THAT CURRENTLY EXIST LET ALONE -- PROCESS THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER REQUESTED -- YET TO COME. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR THE BACKLOG OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS READY FOR PROCESSING AND FUNDING HAS INCREASED FROM ABOUT THREE POINT TWO BILLION. TO FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS MORE OUT THERE I THAT MAY NOT EVEN MAKE THIS ROUND OF FUNDING. AS A REMAINS AN URGENT NEED TO INVEST THE REMAINING PROP FIFTY ONE FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE NEED TO SELL THE REMAINING FIVE BILLION VOTER APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BONDS IN FISCAL YEARS. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO LOCAL EDUCATION EDGY AGENCIES BY JULY. TWENTY TWENTY DELAY IN THE SALE OF SCHOOL FACILITY BONDS NOT ONLY UNDERMINES THE WILL OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHO SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR BY PASSING PROPOSITION. FIFTY ONE BUT IT ALSO DEPRIVE STUDENTS OF SAFE IN MODERN CLASSROOMS WHILE INCREASING TAXPAYER COSTUME REDUCING BUYING POWER. NEW FACILITIES ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN DISTRICTS AN AGING SCHOOL FACILITIES REQUIRE REPAIRS AND RECONSTRUCTION TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS. ELAINE NEEDED STATE FUNDING AND BOND SALES INCREASES TAXPAYER COST IS WELL AS WELL AS REDUCES BUYING POWER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUE TO LOOK AT INCREASING INTEREST RATES. IN THE BOND MARKET IS RD REFLECTING HIGHER INTEREST COSTS TO SELL BONDS. FURTHER STATEWIDE CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE ESCALATING SIGNIFICANTLY -- BY 68% PER YEAR WITH MUCH HIGHER RATES IN MULTIPLE REGIONS DUE TO THE DEVASTATING FIRES. FOR THESE REASONS -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE REMAINING PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE SCHOOL BONDS FOR THOSE PROJECTS NO LATER THAN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AS THE VOTERS HAVE CLEARLY STATED THEIR DESIRE FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN THE CONSTRUCTION. RENOVATION REPAIR A SCHOOL FACILITIES AND MISTER CHAIR AGAIN SINCERELY MEANNESS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY VERY VERY GRATEFUL SIR I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. JUST TO JUST. TO DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHAT THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE IN DEBT SERVICE WOULD BE. ASSOCIATED WITH -- MAKING THE FULL FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN REMAINING BOND FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH US THE NEXT TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY OF BUDGET PROCESS YES SIR IT'S IT'S ESTIMATED SAYS AN APPROXIMATE NUMBER FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BONDS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT A SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR. INCUMBENTS WITH THE STATE GENERAL FUND. SIXTY MILLION FOR EACH ONE BILLION AND BOND APPROXIMATE YES SIR OKAY. AND HAS IT BEEN ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE MANNING SITUATION OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND WHETHER THE AS TO WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL MANNING THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROCESS -- THE ADDITIONAL BOND -- APPLICATIONS THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IN THIS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL. I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN NOR DO I BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY THIS IS MY OWN EDITORIAL -- WHAT'S BEING RECOMMENDED. I HAVE TO IMAGINE IS WHAT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION IS NEEDING ON AND IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTING WITH IN THE BUDGET -- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED -- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU JUST FOR AT FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SHORT STAFFED AND THE NUMBER OF BONDS IT NEED TO BE PROCESSED AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO A LONG WAY -- PSC HAS SENT A FABULOUS JOB WE WERE WITH HIM VERY CLOSELY AND MANY PROJECTS. AND THEY NEED FOLKS IN THEIR BEING ABLE TO GET THESE DOLLARS PUT THE WORK AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS HEADWAY I WITH THE INVESTMENT OF TEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. WELL I THINK -- I THINK WE ALL ARE INTERESTED IN. IN MOVING THE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION EFFORTS FORWARD AT A RAPID PACE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEMANDS ON THE GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET AND YOUR IN -- YOU'RE IN THE QUEUE THERE WAS WHERE THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THANK YOU SO MUCH RICHER AND AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU MEMBERS. WE'RE GOING TO RESERVE PUBLIC COMMENT UNTIL THE END OF ALL OF THE ISSUES SO WE WILL NOW MOVE -- TO THE TOP OF THE AGENDA ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED ISSUE NUMBER. ONE UPDATE ON K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT FISCAL HEALTH THIS IS AN INFORMATION ONLY I DON'T. FINE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU'RE FAMILIAR FACE AND THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I HEAR. DESCRIBE SPENT SOME TIME HERE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- IN MEMBERS AND STAFF. SENATE ROTH ALWAYS OF PLEASURE TO INTERACT WITH YOU -- APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICES MY OWN REPRESENTATIVE AT HOME AND IN RIVERSIDE. MIKE FIND A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM -- JUST HANDED OUT TO YOU IS THE OUTLINE THAT I'M GONNA FOLLOW HAPPY -- TO PAUSE AND TAKE QUESTIONS AT ANY POINT -- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DATA THAN WHAT IS IN YOUR STAFF REPORT -- SIMPLY BECAUSE WERE RIGHT AT THE POINT WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE REPORTING THEIR SECOND IN A ROOM. REPORTING DATA AND THAT BECAME -- THE FINAL OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES REPORTED THAT TO US YESTERDAY WHICH WAS JUST HOURS AFTER STAFF PREPARED THEIR REPORT AND SO -- HI I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANYTHING THAT'S IN THE STAFF REPORT BUT WHAT I'VE HANDED YOU OR AT LEAST THE ATTACHMENTS I'VE HANDED YOU. ARE UPDATED AS OF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. SO AT FIRST INTERIM BACK IN DECEMBER WHICH IS REFLECTED IN YOUR STAFF REPORT -- THERE WERE FORTY TWO QUALIFIED -- DISTRICTS OF HISTORY HERE REMEMBER IT AT BUDGET ADOPTION COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS REVIEW -- A DISTRICTS BUDGET AND THEY GET THREE OPTIONS ARE PROOF THE BUDGET APPROVE IT WITH CONDITIONS OR DISAPPROVE THE BUDGET -- AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE JUST APPROVALS IN JUST A MOMENT. AT FIRST OR SECOND INTERIM REPORT SO FIRST IN A ROOM IS DATA THROUGH OCTOBER REPORTED IN DECEMBER. THAT SENIOR STAFF REPORT SECOND ENORMOUS DATA THROUGH JANUARY REPORTED -- MID MARCH THAT WOULD BE IN DATA THAT -- UNOFFICIAL DATA THAT I'M SHARING WITH YOU -- THAT WE'VE SURVEYED EACH OF THE COUNTY OFFICES OVER -- THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WHEN THEY REVIEW INTERIM REPORTS -- THE DETERMINATION SLIGHTLY DIFFERENCE NOT AN APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL PROCESS THE DISTRICTS SELF CERTIFIES WHETHER THEY'RE POSITIVE QUALIFIED OR NEGATIVE. POSITIVE IS THAT FOR THE CURRENT INTO SUBSEQUENT YEARS THE DISTRICT CAN MEET ALL OF ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS QUALIFIED IS THE DISTRICT MAY NOT MEET ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS IN THE CURRENT PLUS TWO SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND IN NEGATIVE WOULD BE THAT THE DISTRICT. WILL NOT MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE CURRENT PLUS ONE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. AND THE COUNTY OFFICE IN THEIR REVIEW THEN -- THE CURSOR DOES NOT OCCUR WITHOUT SELF CERTIFICATION AND IF THEY DON'T CONCURRED IN THERE'S GENERALLY SOME TYPE OF DOWNGRADE -- OF OF THAT SO IF THE DISTRICTS OMITTED POSITIVE THE COUNTY BELIEVES ARE QUALIFIED THE COUNTY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT. THE SECOND IN REPORTING DATA THAT I SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS ALL SELF CERTIFICATIONS JUST TURNED IN IN THE LAST WEEK. AND SO THE COUNTY OFFICES NOW OR IN THEIR THIRTY DAY PERIOD OF REVIEW AND SO ALL OF THIS COMES FROM DISTRICTS IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF ANY COUNTY OFFICE REVIEW. AT SECOND IN ROOM. SHOW ME BACK UP AT FIRST AN ARM DECEMBER THERE WERE FORTY TWO DISTRICTS THAT WERE QUALIFIED THIRTY NINE SELF QUALIFIED IN THREE WHERE THE COUNTY OFFICE CHANGE THEM. FROM POSITIVE TO QUALIFIED. FOR NEGATIVE BOND SELF CERTIFICATIONS IN ONE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION NEGATIVE WHICH WAS A A QUALIFY DOWNGRADED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE SEEN A COUNTY OFFICE IN EITHER THE QUALIFIED FOR NEGATIVE CATEGORY. AT SECOND IN REPORTING -- THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE QUALIFIED SELF CERTIFICATIONS DOWN FROM FORTY TWO AT FIRST INTERIM. AND REMARKABLY THE SAME NUMBER THAT WE HAD A YEAR AGO ITSELF THAT THE SECOND IN A ROOM AND JUST A FOOTNOTE. THE FIRST INTERNET FORTY TWO IT FIRST IN ARM WAS THE SAME NUMBER WE HAD A YEAR AGO IN DECEMBER -- SO WE'RE ON A ROLL HERE MATCHING YOUR YEAR TO YEAR. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE A DROP IN QUALIFICATIONS. BETWEEN FIRST INTERMENT SECOND AN ARM THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO POINT IN TIME WHEN WE'RE LOOKING OUT OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. IS IN FACT THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET PROPOSAL ON JAN TEN BUDGET AND THE JANTAN BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR -- WAS -- MORE POSITIVE THAN DISTRICTS HAD EXPECTED LAST DECEMBER WHEN THEY WERE FILING THEIR FIRST IN ARM HAS A HIGHER COLOR TO IT -- HAS THE PROVISION FOR ASSISTANCE WITH REGARD TO THE STIRS RATE -- AND HAS -- SOME FUNDS ALLOCATED -- IN SPECIAL AT ALL OF THOSE OBVIOUSLY IMPROVED THE OUTLOOK THE DISTRICTS HAD -- ON ON THEIR BUDGET STARTING NEXT YEAR AND CAN GOING ON THEY'RE ALSO FOR NEGATIVE SELF CERTIFICATIONS -- SAME SAME AS AT FIRST IN ROOM. AND THE SAME DISTRICTS THERE WERE FOUR LAST YEAR THE ALSO HOWEVER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE THEY ARE FOR THE THREE OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND AS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. IS AWARE -- DISTRICTS GENERALLY DON'T STAY AT THE NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION LEVEL LONG A LOT OF ASSISTANCE COMES THEIR WAY TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION. TURN THE CORNER AND GET THEM BACK TO FISCAL HEALTH -- THE DISTRICT THAT REMAINS FEATHER FALLS -- UNION ELEMENTARY BUTTE COUNTY HAS BEEN THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY WILL CEASE TO OPERATE AS A DISTRICT THIS JUNE. THEY HAVE TEN KIDS LEFT FIVE OF WHICH ARE IN EIGHTH GRADE TWO K. EIGHT DISTRICT AND ONCE THOSE FIVE KIDS PROMOTE -- A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT WILL SERVE -- WHAT IS CURRENTLY FEATHER FALLS THAT HAS BEEN THE PLAN FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE COUNTY OFFICE BUTTE COUNTY OFFICES BEEN SUPPORTING THEM? FINANCIALLY TO GET TO THIS POINT -- TO GET THESE FIVE EIGHTH GRADERS -- BASICALLY GET THESE FIVE KIDS THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE BEFORE CHANGE WAS MADE. THE FOUR NEGATIVES BEYOND FEATHER FULL OF THE ADDITIONAL THREE BEYOND -- IS SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED WHICH I KNOW WHERE THE REPRESENT THE AREA OR NOT YOU READ A LOT ABOUT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE WE'RE AT SOUTHERN KERN IN KERN COUNTY IN SWEETWATER. UNION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE HAVE ONE LACK OF GOING CONCERN THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO A NEGATIVE. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE COUNTY OFFICE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DESIGNATED DISTRICT AS LACK A GOING CONCERN AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO JUST. IN THE BUDGET REVIEW PROCESS -- IN THAT WOULD BE OFFERED UNIFIED IN -- RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND AS I'VE MENTIONED WE HAVE ONE COUNTY OFFICE IT'S NEGATIVE THIS IS AMADOR COUNTY -- UP THE ROAD A BIT -- FROM HERE -- THIS IS A SINGLE DISTRICT COUNTY. ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS QUALIFIED WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES NEGATIVE THEY ARE COMPLETELY -- INTER TWINED -- IN THERE'S BOTH THE FINANCES AND THEIR SERVICES THEY HAVE A COMMON BOARD. BUT AS OF JANUARY FIRST HAVE TO SUPERINTENDENTS SO THE ELECTED THE UP TO JANUARY FIRST THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WERE ONE AND THE SAME. THE VOTERS IN JUNE ELECTED A DIFFERENT PERSON TO BE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SO YOU HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL -- SOUR BURDEN AND NOW YOU HAVE A A LITTLE BIT OF OF OF SPLIT FROM A LEADERSHIP STANDPOINT IN IN DIRECTION. MAY I ASK A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY IT'S FUN WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO THE ONE DISTRICT THAT -- STILL HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE COE AS A LACK OF GOING CONCERN OVER. SO I WILL I WISH I HAD POSITIVE NEWS THERE SENATOR -- SPECIALLY FOR YOU -- IS SINCE THIS IS IN IN YOUR DISTRICT -- OUR TWO WEEKS AGO STAFF AND RECOMMENDED A NUMBER OF BUDGET CUTS TO BRING THEM IN -- TO A STRONGER FISCAL HEALTH THE BOARD OPTED NOT -- TO APPROVE ANY OF THEM. THEY ISSUED NO MARCH FIFTEENTH NOTICES OF WHICH SOME WERE IMBEDDED IN THOSE CUTS NOT ALL -- AND SO THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THIS IS CHANGE THE APPROACH TO CHANGE IT -- WE WERE THERE WE HAD A TEAM THEIR LAST WEEK LAST WEDNESDAY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WOULD BE OUR FOURTH VISIT -- IN THREE MONTHS. THE TEAM LAST WEEK WAS THERE SPECIFICALLY DO A FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS THAT WILL GIVE US A LITTLE BETTER SENSE -- NOW FACT NOT ABLE TO FACTOR IN THOSE CUTS THAT WERE PROPOSED -- AND SO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A LACK A GOING CONCERN IS THE SAME AS A NEGATIVE. IT JUST CAN HAPPEN AT ANY POINT THIS HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER -- INTERESTING THE DISTRICTS SUBMITTED ITS SECOND ENORMOUS QUALIFIED. NOT QUITE SURE HOW YOU ARE A LACK GOING CONCERNING YOUR QUALIFIED -- SO THAT'LL BE A CONVERSATION PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE A COUNTY OFFICE ABOUT. MOST LIKELY DOWNGRADING THAT TO A NEGATIVE. THE RIGHTS YOUR QUESTION IS. I DON'T HAVE A AN ANSWER AT THIS POINT -- WHAT ARE THE TYPICAL NEXT STEPS IF WE'VE EVER SEEN A SITUATION LIKE THIS BEFORE YES SO TYPICAL NEXT STEPS ARE THIS THE LOCAL ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD STEPS UP AND HAS WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO? THEY DIDN'T DO THAT TWO WEEKS AGO -- THEY CITED A LACK OF CREDIBILITY IN THE NUMBERS -- THE DISTRICT HAS HAD A STRONG -- BUSINESS OFFICER THE LAST TWO YEARS -- SHE'S INDICATED SHE WILL NOT STAY BEYOND JUNE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS WE AS AN AGENCY DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY THE NUMBERS. BUT CLEARLY THE DISTRICT BOARD -- WAS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS SO -- THE SUPERINTENDENT'S NEXT STEP THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT -- OFFICE IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S TEAMS NEXT STEP IS TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SET OF CUTS THEY NEED O MAKE CUTS -- THE DIFFERENCE YEARS THAT WON'T INVOLVE ANY -- CERTIFICATED STAFF BECAUSE WILL BE PASSED THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. FOR ME TO GET YOU OFF TO REFUND. JUST WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. I'M QUALIFIED AND LACK OF GOING CONCERN AN UNQUALIFIED. SO QUALIFY A WOULD IT BE SO IN ALL CASES WERE LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW CURRENT YOUR PLUS. TO QUAL POSITIVE WOULD BE A EVERYTHING IS WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. QUALIFIED WOULD BE THEY MAY NOT MEET THEIR OP FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OVER THE THREE YEAR WINDOW. NEGATIVE IS THEY WILL NOT AND WE GENERALLY SHORTEN IT TO A TWO YEAR WINDOW. BLACK A GOING CONCERN -- LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A NEGATIVE -- LANGUAGE AROUND IT INTERPRETATIONS A TAD DIFFERENT BUT THE INTER THE LIST OF INTERVENTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME. AND FROM A PROCEDURAL SAMPLE THE WAY WE TREAT THEM UP ALMOST IDENTICAL TO A NEGATIVE DISTRICT A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION. TO HELP CENTER. I WONDER WHY THEY CREATE ON THE CATEGORY BUT THAT'S THE WAY BUREAUCRACY Là TIME IT'S A TIMING ISSUE -- SO THE CERTIFICATIONS APOLOGY QUALIFIED IN NEGATIVE HAPPENED WHEN THE COUNTY IS WHEN THE DISTRICT THIS IS -- DOING ITS FIRST AND SECOND IN A ROOM. IF SOMETHING CHANGED IN BETWEEN THOSE POINT IN TIME THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT HAS THIS ADDITIONAL TOOL -- THAT IS A THAT'S REALLY IRRESPECTIVE OF TIME IT COULD HAPPEN THE DAY AFTER THE ENORMOUS SUBMITTED. A DISTRICT COULD COMMIT A POSITIVE INTERIM AND SOMETHING CHANGE OVERNIGHT -- THE AVERAGE SITUATION WHERE BOARD ELECTED NOT TO MAKE CUTS THE CUTS MAY HAVE DOES ANY OF THE DISTRICT AS POSITIVE JUST. USING A FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY SUBMITTED THEIR IN A ROOM WITH THE ANTICIPATION THE BOARD WAS GOING TO ADOPT THOSE -- THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A BOARD DOESN'T ADOPT THEM IN THIS CASE AND OVERNIGHT. THEN THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THEM FROM -- A TO A LACK A GOING CONCERN IN FACT USING OFFERED AS EXAMPLE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST NOVEMBER. THERE ARE THERE BUDGET WAS APPROVED BY THE COUNTY IN SEPTEMBER. BUT THEN BY NOVEMBER -- THING SAID WHAT HAPPENED DOWN HILL BUT WHY SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IT WE JUST. WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT IS PROBABLY DRAMATIC -- JUST STAY PROGRESS INSTEAD OF PROGRESS SEEN REGRESSED THEY REGRESS. OKAY AND IT BECAME VERY APPARENT IN NOVEMBER THAT THAT REGRESSION WAS I WAS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ARE ANDERSON THANK YOU [inaudible] YES ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. I GUESS YES IT IS STILL MORNING SO. IT THE DAYS KIND OF RUN TOGETHER SO IN THE CASE OF ALL VERGE UNIFIED THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT UNUSUAL OF THAT THE BOARD WOULDN'T TAKE YOUR ADVICE. SO IT ISN'T IS NOT OUR ADVICE IN THIS CASE IT WAS DISTRICTS STAFF'S ADVICE THE SUPERINTENDENT AND OKAY THE APPROPRIATE STAFF'S ADVICE SO IS IT IN A THEN. YEAH OKAY CASE LIKE THIS YOUNG. BOY BOARDS. BOARDS OFTEN DO NOT. ALWAYS ADOPT STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THESE WERE NOT OUT OF THE SKY CUTS THESE WERE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED FOR MANY WEEKS MANY MONTHS. THE FINANCIAL CONDITION THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN WIDELY KNOWN THEY'VE HAD A BUDGET THANK BUDGET VISOR COMMITTEE MADE UP OF THEIR LABOR PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OTHER STAFF MEETING FOR MONTHS I'VE ACTUALLY PRESENTED TO THEM BACK IN -- EARLY DECEMBER I THINK IT WAS A MAYBE END OF NOVEMBER CAN'T RECALL NOW -- TO GIVE THEM KIND OF A AN OVERVIEW OF PROCESS -- SO THE THE LACK OF SUPPORT BY THE BOARD ON A GIVEN EVENING WAS NOT EXPECTED OKAY AND TIMING WAS SUCH. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FOURTEENTH FIVE IF I HAVE MY DATES RIGHT -- THAT LEFT NO ALTERNATIVE. AHEAD OF MARCH FIFTEENTH. RIGHT SO COMPLETELY CHANGES NOW THE LANDSCAPE OF WHAT CUTS ARE -- POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO THE DISTRICT EVEN TO ACT ON NOW SUBSEQUENT SO THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING THE WAY OF A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION BUT WHAT I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE CUT. THEN WILL THE SCHOOL LIKELY CLOSE. NO NO NO THIS IS IT JUST THIS IS A DISTRICT OF TWENTY THOUSAND WITH -- WHILE I SHOULD KNOW THIS -- EIGHTEEN SCHOOLS AT LEAST THREE HIGH SCHOOLS AND AN ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL -- PLUS NUMEROUS -- ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SO NO THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS FOR THE COUNTY WOULD BE. IF THE DISTRICT DOESN'T ADOPT ALTERNATIVE CUTS IN THEIR IN JUNE FOR THEIR ADOPTED BUDGET THAT'S EFFECTIVE JULY. ONE THE NEXT OPTION THE COUNTY HAS WOULD BE TO DISAPPROVE THEIR BUDGET FOR THE NEW YEAR. THAT SETS IN MOTION THEN A PROCESS IT'S FAIRLY LAID OUT IN - PROCESS IT'S ARTICULATED FAIRLY WELL IN CODE -- THERE ARE TO PASS ONE IS WHAT'S CALLED A BUDGET REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCESS WHICH IS LAID OUT IN SOME DETAIL IN THE LAST DECADE WE'VE USE THAT PROCESS ONCE. IT CAN BE WAIVED WHICH IS TO ADDITIONALLY WHAT HAPPENS -- BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IN THE DISTRICT'S BOARD THEY WAVE THAT PROCESS. AND THEN CD E. GENERALLY AGREES IF IF YOU'VE GOT AGREEMENT LOCAL USED CD WOULD GENERALLY AGREE WITHOUT -- AND THEN THEY WILL THEY WILL GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO WORK THINGS OUT -- UP TO THE DECEMBER TIME PERIOD. THEY DO CONTINUE TO HAVE AUTHORITY TO SPEND BECAUSE THE LOCAL BOARD HAS ADOPTED A BUDGET IT'S THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THAT IT DOESN'T MEET THE CRITERIA IS UNABLE TO APPROVE IT. SO THIRTY TO SPEND DOES CONTINUE -- BUT ULTIMATELY THEY'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WITH THE FACT THAT THE BUDGETS OUT OF OUT OF WHACK SENATE SO UPSIDE DOWN BUDGETS ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A LACK OF CASH. IF YOU ARE SPENDING MORE THAN YOU'RE BRINGING IN BALTIMORE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NOT THE BUDGET. THE BANK ACCOUNT ITSELF -- BEGINS TO DRAIN -- INSOLVENCY IS DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA IN K. FOURTEEN AS YOUR INABILITY TO MEET PAYROLL FROM A CASH STANDPOINT. SO TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES. AND THAT IS WHAT TRIGGERS WHAT YOU ALL KNOW OF IS THE GENERAL TERM OF A STATE TAKEOVER. WOULD BE TAPPED AND SO OUR ROLE IN THAT IS TO FORECAST HELP FORECAST. IF THEY MAKE NO CORRECTIVE ACTION HELP FORECAST THAT POINT IN TIME BACK UP SO THAT WE CAN BE FAIR. FOR FOR THIS. LARGER BODY -- TO TALK ABOUT -- THAT HELP AYE I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE COURSE. I FULLY EXPECT THEM TO TURN. OKAY CHANGE DIRECTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP ON THAT. THANK YOU SIR WELL WE GET YOU BACK ON TRACK YEAH. NO NO YOU'RE FINE WE SHOULD THE QUESTIONS -- NEXT CATEGORY IS WHAT I'M CALLING THE BUDGET ACT AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT AND SO -- HISTORICALLY THICK MAT HAS ONLY ENGAGED WITH DISTRICTS WHEN WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO THE DISTRICT EITHER BY THE DISTRICT OR THE COUNTY OFFICE. TO ASSIST THEM SOMETIMES WE ARE SENT THERE BY THIS BODY OR THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OR THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING NINETY FIVE PLUS PERCENT THE TIME A DISTRICT CALLED US AND ASKED FOR HELP SOMETIMES IT'S THE COUNTY OFFICE AFTER AGREEMENT WITH THE DISTRICT. CALLING TO ASK US FOR HELP IN THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET ENGAGEMENT -- THERE'S A SINGLE LINE THAT BASICALLY CALLS UPON US TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN WORKING WITH FISCALLY DISTRESSED DISTRICTS AND SO -- WE CALL THAT INTERNALLY AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT AS OPPOSED TO WAITING. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TRIGGERS TO THAT AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT THOSE ARE OUTLINED HERE IN. IN THE DOCUMENT I PROVIDED THE FIRST IS DISAPPROVED BUDGET SO THAT'S A SEPTEMBER TIME PERIOD. THERE WERE SIX ACROSS THE STATE THIS YEAR UP FROM TO THE PRIOR YEAR. WE AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGED WITH ALL SIX BUT WE ONLY WENT IN AND WORKED WITH THREE OF THOSE. TWO OF THE SIX THEY WERE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED. AND ONE OF THE SIX WHO IS IN THE WOULD UNIFIED THAT WERE IN BASICALLY EVERY DAY ALREADY -- AND SO THE OTHER THREE WE ENGAGED WITHIN THOSE WERE SACRAMENTO CITY. SWEETWATER UNION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND CALAVERAS -- IN CALAVERAS COUNTY. AND WHEN WE WENT THERE -- WE CONDUCTED A FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS AND I'VE GOTTEN AHEAD OF MYSELF AGO BACK TO TRIGGERS SORRY -- DISAPPROVED BUDGET IS ONE OF THE FIVE TRIGGERS. A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE. AT IN ARMOR PORT. THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION SO DISTRICT THAT STAYS IN THAT QUALIFIED STATUS MORE THAN THREE IN A REPORT. FIRST SECOND THE FOLLOWING YOUR FIRST OR SECOND FIRST SECOND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FISCAL YEAR JUST THREE CONSECUTIVE GENERAL REPORTS. A DOWNGRADE SO COUNTY OFFICE FOR THE CD E. CHANGING THE CERTIFICATION. FOR A FORTY TWO ONE TWENTY SEVEN POINT SIX WHICH IS THE LACK A GOING CONCERN. SO THE REASON WE WERE JUST IN OUR LAST WEEK WAS TO CONDUCT A FISCAL HEALTH RISK AND HOUSES. TRIGGERED BY THEIR DOWNGRADE ARE THEIR DESIGNATION AS A LACK A GOING CONCERN. THE REASON WE'VE DONE A FISCAL HEALTH RISK IN HOUSES IN THE FALL IN SACRAMENTO CITY CALAVERAS SWEETWATER WAS BECAUSE THERE BUDGETS WERE DISAPPROVED. IN IN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE EXERCISED SOME DISCRETION WHILE THERE WERE SIX DISAPPROVED. I ONLY OUTLINED THOSE THREE AND I TOLD YOU WHY WE DIDN'T GO TO THREE OTHERS WE ARE BEING VERY THOUGHTFUL IN OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH BOTH THE COUNTY AND DISTRICT TO DO SOME INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. BEFORE WE DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD VALUE IN THAT THE TOOL WE'RE GOING TO USE THE FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS TOOL WHICH WE'VE HAD FOR YEARS. IS GOING TO ADD VALUE AND HELP BRING ABOUT. A CHANGE FOR THEM -- OTHERWISE IT'S PROBABLY A DIFFERENT TOOL OR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT THAT MAY BE HELPFUL TO THEM. WHAT WHAT A WHAT ABOUT LOS ANGELES AB ONE DAY THEY WERE? THEY GOT A BAD REPORT FROM THEIR OFFICE OF EDUCATION ALL IF I'D AT FOR THE SELF CERTIFIED QUALIFIED IN DECEMBER IN A SELF CERTIFIED QUALIFIED LAST WEEK. SO THEY AT THIS POINT HAVE THE COUNTY YOU. I'M. RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT THEIR SETTLEMENT -- WITH YOU TO WITH THE UNITED TEACHERS LOS ANGELES. SO REMEMBER -- WHEN YOU REACH A -- A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH A LABOR PARTNER -- YOU MUST FILE A DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE COSTS OF THAT LABOR AGREEMENT ON THE TERMS AND THE COST OVER THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT WHETHER IT'S ONE YEAR THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS -- THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE FOR ANY PUBLIC AGENCY NOT JUST SCHOOLS. ARM AND IN THE CASE OF SCHOOLS THE COUNTY OFFICE THEN -- IS BECAUSE THE DISTRICT WAS QUALIFY THE COUNTY OFFICES GIVEN TEN DAYS TO REVIEW. THAT SOME MIDDLE AND THEY MUST RESPOND TO IT THEY DON'T GET TO DISAPPROVE THEY CAN COMMENT ON IT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SENATOR WAS -- LA COUNTY OFFICES A LETTER IN RESPONSE TO THAT -- SETTLEMENT THAT RAISED NUMBER OF CONCERNS SO I THINK -- DIFFERENT THAN. A COUPLE OTHER DISTRICTS -- LA. FISCAL ISSUE IS NOT -- TOMORROW. IT'S NOT NEXT YEAR THERE FISCAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THE AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR OUT APPROACH IN THE FOURTH YOUR ROUTE. AND NOW WILL BECOME VERY APPARENT WHEN THE DOCTOR BUDGET IN JUNE. BECAUSE WHAT IS TODAY THE FOURTH YEAR THAT WE'RE NOT REPORTING ON BECOMES THE THIRD YEAR THAT IS PART OF THE ANALYSIS. WHICH IS WHY THE COUNTIES LETTER GAVE THEM PER CODE FORTY FIVE DAYS TO MAKE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS -- THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS PAST THEY'VE NOT ADOPTED THOSE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS YET -- THEY DID ADOPT A SECOND AN ARM LAST WEEK I BELIEVE THEY WERE LATE DOING SO -- BUT THEY DID ADOPT ONE IN THE ADOPTED AS QUALIFIED. SO IS THE IS THE PEDAL TO THE METAL IN THE NEXT BUDGET GAS IS ISSUED SO IF THEY SUBMIT A BUDGET ON JULY ONE TO THE TO LA COUNTY OFFICE OF BAD AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS WHAT I EXPECT WILL BE A BILLION TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN. WHAT WILL BE YOUR THREE THEN THE COUNTIES CHOICE AT THAT POINT WOULD BE TO DISAPPROVE THEIR BUDGET AND START DOWN THIS COURSE? OF EITHER BUDGET REVIEW COMMITTEE OR WAVING THAT AND THE TWO PARTIES COMING TOGETHER TO WORK OUT A SOLUTION. OF FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANNOUNCES THE TOOL THAT WE USE ON THESE AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS IT'S A TOOL THAT. HAS DEVELOPED IN USE FOR MANY YEARS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THIS PAST SUMMER -- UPDATING AND IF YOU WILL KIND OF MODERNIZING IT. THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY QUESTIONS ACROSS TWENTY HIGH RISK AREAS OR NOT ALL HIGH RISK BUT TWENTY RISK AREAS. WE DO WAIT EACH QUESTION. ARM BETWEEN HIGH RISK MARKET RISK AND LOW RISK AND IT AND ULTIMATELY -- SCORE THE DISTRICT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE QUESTIONS BY THE WAY OR YES OR NO THEY'RE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE DON'T ALLOW MAYBE ANSWERS. TRULY WE FORCE THE ISSUE IT'S YES OR NO -- FOR IT MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE BUT THAT WOULD BE FEW. SO I'VE ALREADY RELEASED GONE AHEAD OF MYSELF AND SPOKE TO THE BOARD ON DISAPPROVE BUDGETS. AT FIRST IN A REPORTING WE HAVE FOUR NEGATIVES WE HAD ALREADY PERFORMED FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS ON TWO SACKS CITY IN SWEETWATER. THE OTHER TWO WERE BEING MONITOR ONE B. AND FEATHER FOR FALL SOME OF OUR EXPLAIN THAT WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING -- ANY INTERVENTION THERE. AND THE THIRD IS SOUTHERN KERN -- WHICH THE COUNTY OFFICES HAS ALREADY LOAN THEM CASH TO HELP. THEM -- IN THEIR CASH FLOW -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THEM. AT FIRST IN ARE WE ALSO HAD -- SIX DISTRICTS THAT QUALIFIED UNDER THIS TRIGGERS HAVING THREE CONSECUTIVE. QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS -- ONE OF THEM I'M SORRY THE THREE WHILE. THERE WERE SIX THE QUALIFIED IN DOING OUR HOMEWORK WERE VISITING THREE OF THOSE IN FACT HAVE VISITED TWO OF THE THREE ALREADY -- FIRST ONE'S COACHELLA VALLEY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT IS COMING UP THE FIRST OF MAY. CLIMATE TRINITY IN HUMBOLDT -- WE WERE AT TWO WEEKS AGO OCEANSIDE IN SAN DIEGO -- I THINK WE ARE THERE ACTUALLY THIS WEEK -- AND WE ARE MONITORING THREE OTHERS GOAL TRAIL IN ELDORADO IN CASCADE AND GATEWAY IN BOTH IN SHASTA COUNTY. AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED WE WERE AT OUR LAST WEEK CONDUCTING THIS WORK THERE THE LACK A GOING CONCERN. ALL THREE DISTRICTS THAT WERE DOWNGRADED IT FIRST IN ARM -- MARCH. FOR FORTY A TAPE OF MADERA IN MARIN OAKLAND IN ALAMEDA AND RIVERSIDE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- WE ARE MONITORING THOSE -- BOTH LARKSPUR. I'M SORRY -- LARKSPUR SUBMITTED A A QUALIFIED BUDGET SECOND AN ARM. OUR INNER PORTED SECOND ARM BOTH OAKLAND RIVERSIDE SUBMITTED POSITIVES. AT SECOND INTERIM -- AND SO THEY WOULD THOSE POSITIVE CERTIFICATIONS WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE -- THEY'VE MADE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE -- I WOULD NOT AT THIS POINT NOT QUESTION RIVERSIDE ON THAT BUT OAKLAND -- I WOULD SAY THAT SO. PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH -- SECOND REPORTING THE ONLY CHANGE TO THE LIST WOULD BE ALLEN ROCK IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH WE'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THERE -- MULTIPLE TIMES A COUNTY HAS A TEAM IN PLACE -- WORKING WITH THE DISTRICT A MONITORING THAT MAY END UP NEEDING TO BE SCHEDULED FOR FISCAL HEALTH FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS COMING UP. THE COMMITTEES FAMILIAR WITH ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FORTY IT WAS THE BUDGET -- TECHNICAL CORRECTION THIRD A TECHNICAL -- CLEANUP BILL LAST AUGUST THAT ALSO INCLUDED SOME POLICY ITEMS THAT SHIFTED -- WHO ULTIMATELY -- TAKES THE LEAD ON A DISTRICT THAT HOW IT NEEDS A STATE EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION -- IT WENT CERTAINLY HAS SOME PROVISIONS GOING FORWARD BUT IT ALSO FOR THE FOR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OUTSTANDING BALANCES -- THAT THE THE STATE FROM PRIOR ON EMERGENCY PREPARATIONS IT TOOK EFFECT IT IS ALSO EFFECTIVE FOR THEM. THOSE WOULD INCLUDING A WOOD -- VALLEJO CITY OAKLAND AND SELF MONTEREY A JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT ONLY ONE OF THOSE IN THE WOULD -- WAS CURRENTLY BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE THE OTHER THREE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE RECOVERY PROCESS. AND WORK THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AUTHORITY HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THEM -- AND SO IN ALL THESE CASES EIGHTEEN FORTY PROVIDES THAT INSTEAD OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT -- BEING THE LEAD ON THIS IT IS NOW THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. ARM AND THE ADMINISTRATOR THE TRUSTEE THAT'S A SIGN IS A SIGN BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PRESIDENT THE STATE BOARD. BUT THE DAY TO DAY -- OVERSIGHT AND OPERATIONS OF THE DISTRICT IN THOSE -- ARE ARE DEALT WITH BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. THERE WERE -- TWO OF THE FOUR DISTRICTS WILL THING TO WITHIN OAKLAND WHO HAVE BEEN -- BOTH STRUGGLING -- FISCALLY WORK -- CALLED OUT WITH SPECIAL. A NEW AD CODE PROVISIONS. OF THOSE PROVISIONS REQUIRED A FIRST REPORT BY US ON MARCH FIRST UNDER THE CRITERIA OF EIGHTEEN FORTY AND WE ISSUED THOSE. REPORTS -- IN INGLEWOOD PROGRESS IS BEING MADE WITH LYCOS DIRECTION I HAVE TO GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF ADD TO THAT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT -- SHE DID NOT ASK PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPOSED -- EIGHTEEN FORTY BUT THE MINUTE IT WAS PASSED AND SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN SHE EMBRACE THE NEW ROLE SHE HAD AND I IN MY OPINION SHE ASSEMBLED A TEAM HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB -- HELPING INGLEWOOD -- I THINK -- IT WAS MADE MORE PROGRESS IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS UNDER EIGHTEEN FORTY THAN THEY HAD MADE IN THE PRIOR SIX YEARS -- AND SO I I I SEE PROGRESS THERE I THINK WE ALL THAT VISIT ON A REGULAR BASIS SEE PROGRESS AND AND THAT'S THAT'S GOOD NEWS. ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR WORK THAT WAS DUE ON MARCH -- ONE TO HELP -- INFORMED THE MAY REVISED BUDGET IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE DISTRICTS DEFICIT PROJECTED DEFICIT WOULD BE FOR NEXT YEAR -- IN OUR PROJECTION FOR INGLEWOOD IS A ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR UNDER -- EIGHTEEN FORTY IT DOES REQUIRE ACTION IN THE IN THE NEW NEW BUDGET -- BUT THE EIGHTEEN FORTY PROVIDES THAT THE STATE WOULD -- POTENTIALLY APPROPRIATE 75% OF THAT ONE POINT THREE MILLION AS ADDITIONAL AID FOR THE DISTRICT BASED ON THAT PROJECTION. OAKLAND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY UNDERSTAND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SINGLE IN OAKLAND FOR THE LAST YEAR BEEN KINDA LUMPED TOGETHER BUT THAT. THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT ANGLE WHAT IS BEING OPERATED. UP TO LAST OCTOBER BY THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT NOW BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT -- THEY DON'T HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AUTHORITY -- IT IS ACE IF YOU WILL STILL WHAT WE CALL SATE ADMINISTRATOR RUNNING THE DISTRICT MAKING THE DAY TO DAY DECISIONS NOW IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. OAKLAND. GOT ITS EMERGENCY PREPARATION TWO THOUSAND THREE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF RECOVERY AND ULTIMATELY WAS CERTIFIED IS RECOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE LOCAL CONTROL WAS AND RETURNED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION BACK TO THE DISTRICT THE BOARD TO GET SEATS AGAIN HIGHER TO SUPERINTENDENT AND FOR THE LAST DECADE THEN THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING -- WITH A STATE TRUSTEE LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER BUT THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AS A VERY TYPICAL DISTRICT. THEY A DATA FIGHT THEMSELVES SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS I'M JUST OVER A YEAR AGO AND WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THEM IT LITERALLY ALMOST DAILY SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME -- IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ROLES -- BUT CERTAINLY UNDER THE ROLE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY OUR MARCH ONE LETTERS -- DENTAL VICE THAT PROGRESS IN THE DISTRICT IS INCONSISTENT GOVERNANCE IN LEADERSHIP HAVE. DEFICIENCIES I WOULD SAY SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HEIR CFO CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WALKED OUT. AND THERE'S CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL GAVE NOTICE LAST WEEK TO LEAVE NEXT WEEK -- AND SO I I WOULD ADD -- OBVIOUSLY A A LEVEL OF CONCERN -- GIVEN THOSE TWO VERY IMPORTANT FOLKS -- NOW -- STEPPING AWAY FROM THE DISTRICT MY MIKE ME WHAT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND WHAT THE PROJECTED -- OF SIZE OF THE DEFICIT. TO NOW SO THE PROJECTED SIZE THE DEFICITS THE EASY ANSWER HARM ON MARCH WHEN WE ESTIMATE OUT AT SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RECENT SETTLEMENT WITH THEIR TEACHERS. YOU'LL RECALL THAT THEY SIGN THAT TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON MARCH ONE LITERALLY AN HOUR BEFORE WE ISSUED A REPORT. THEY ALSO HAVE ADOPTED SOME BUDGET CUTS ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE MILLION IN BUDGET CUTS SINCE THAT DATE -- LITERALLY JUST YESTERDAY THEY SUBMITTED. THE COST OF THEIR SETTLEMENT I THINK WE'RE IT WEEK THREE IT'S TAKEN HIM THAT LONG TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAD HAVE AGREED. TO IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL YOU GENERALLY KNOW WHAT IT COSTS BEFORE YOU AGREE TO IT -- SO THE EASY ANSWERS SEVEN POINT SIX HOWEVER WE WILL NEED TO DO THE ANALYSIS ON THE DATA THAT WAS SUBMITTED YESTERDAY. AND THE BUDGET CUTS AND WE WILL BE UPDATING WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCES CONSENT WILL BE UPDATING OUR MARCH FIRST REPORT HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS. THE BIGGER QUESTION SIR IS WHAT HAPPENED OVER THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD -- I THINK VERY CANDIDLY ON THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY SLIPPED RIGHT BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE IN -- TWO THOUSAND THREE IN ALL CASES SO IN THIRTY YEARS OF AB -- TWELVE HUNDRED AND THEN THE AUDIENCE IS PAUL WORN WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WAS A STAFFER ON AB TWELVE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS AGO -- BUT SORRY PAUL -- AND SO -- THE IN THOSE THIRTY YEARS WE'VE HAD NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE KIND OF GO OFF THE END. SO I WOULD SAY OF ELEVEN HUNDRED DISTRICTS EACH YEAR GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL. WE HAVE VERY FEW NEGATIVES AND WHEN WE DO WE GET THEM TURNED AROUND AND BACK WHERE THEY NEED TO BE -- IN OAKLAND'S CASE THEY HAD A TRUSTEE IN PLACE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME SERVING -- TO ENSURE THE STATE'S INTERESTS WERE BEING MET AND THAT IS THAT THE ANNUAL REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN WAS BEING MAY -- BUT IT'S CLEAR THE DISTRICT MISLED THAT TRUSTEE -- AND THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT ACCURATE -- AND THEY IN THAT PROCESS HAVE SLID BACK OVER TIME. AND SO I I WILL TELL YOU IN ALL TEN CASES. AND IN ALL CASES GENERALLY OF FISCAL DISTRESS THIS IS A GOVERNMENT SENT A LEADERSHIP ISSUE. IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A FISCAL PROBLEM USUALLY A DECADE OR MORE LATER IN IN WHICH CASE IT GOES BACK ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS A GOVERNANCE IN A LEADERSHIP ISSUE THAT TOOK. ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS OF ACCUMULATED ISSUES. ON THAT AND ALSO WE MANIFEST ITSELF -- SIX YEARS AGO SEVEN QUICK QUESTION. SO THE TRUSTEE WHO YOU SAID YOU FEEL LIKE WAS PROBABLY MISLED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. HOW DO WE PICK OUR TRUSTEES AND WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PICK SOMEONE WHO COULD TELL IF THEY WERE BEING MISLED? SO PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN FORTY THE TRUSTEE. WAS APPOINTED BY THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT SUBSEQUENT EIGHTEEN FORTY THE TRUSTEES APPOINTED BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE CONCURRENT TO THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PRESIDENT THE STATE BOARD. AN ADDITIONAL PROVISION EIGHTEEN FORTY IS AT THAT APPOINTMENT IS MADE FROM A LIST THAT FIXED MATT. A DEN OF VICE AND VETS. THAT WOULD BE THE REAL NEW -- PIECES THAT YOU DON'T JUST. THINK ANYBODY AND FRANKLY THESTATE'S A PREVIOUS STATE SUPERINTENDENT NEVER PICKED ANYBODY THIS WAS A TRUSTEE THAT WAS VERY QUALIFIED TO BE A TRUSTEE. INTERESTING BUT STILL MAYBE GOT A LITTLE MISLED. I THINK THE I THINK THE DISTRICT FRANKLY -- IN PART WAS MISLED ITSELF -- OKAY PROBABLY BY SOME STAFF GOT IT THANK YOU BEFORE I TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES BY THE WAY -- I'VE ASK OF CENTER GLAZER IN CENTER ALLEN TO JOIN US TODAY BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST IN THESE ISSUES. IT ARE THERE NOT AUDITS THAT. DISTRICTS. GO THROUGH THAT. INDEPENDENT AUDITS THAT SHOULD PICK UP SOME OF THESE PIECES OF INFORMATION SO APPS ABSOLUTELY CENTER ROTH -- THERE'S AN ANNUAL AUDIT REQUIRED -- INDEPENDENT AUDIT REQUIRED -- IN ADDITION WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED WHICH REQUIRES A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT REVIEW THE BUDGET THE IN A REPORT REVIEW THE AUDIT AS WELL -- REVIEW THE ON AUDITED AXLES THEIR SUBMITTED EACH SEPTEMBER ON THE PRIOR YEAR SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES -- I THINK THIS IS ONE OF OUR FEW CASES WHERE WE DIDN'T SEE THE TOLL SYSTEM WORK AS DESIGNED -- VERY CANDIDLY -- WE ACTUALLY IN SOME WORK WE DID IN OAKLAND LAST SPRING CHALLENGE THE PREVIOUS AUDITOR'S AND SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE REPORTED ON THESE THINGS -- HINDSIGHT'S ALWAYS TWENTY TWENTY LET'S BE HONEST -- BUT WE ACTUALLY TOOK THE PREVIOUS AUDITOR'S TO TASK A VERY REPUTABLE FIRM BY THE WAY. THE DOES A LOT OF SCHOOL BUSINESS WORK AND SO WOULD NOT -- EVER -- GENERALLY DOUBT THEIR ABILITY BUT I I DON'T WE DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD ASKED ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS OR IN ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS HAD REALLY EVALUATED THE ANSWERS THE DISTRICT GAVE IN RESPONSE THAT'S PROBABLY A BETTER. WAY OF DESCRIBING IT DID THEY TAKE THAT DEEPER DIVE AFTER RECEIVING THE RESPONSES I DO THINK THEY ASK QUESTIONS THE DISTRICT RESPONDED. HIS ANSWERS WERE ACCEPTED UNFORTUNATE. GENERAL AT IN AS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. I WONDERED IF YOU COULD GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPLANATION OF HOW THEY WERE MISLED AND WHETHER OR NOT THESE THAT THESE ACTIONS ROSE TO ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL -- POTENTIAL CRIMINAL -- ACTIVITY THAT THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. SO SENATOR ARE ARE WILL LET ME ANSWERS ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST -- THE WORK WE HAVE DONE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A WHAT WE COMMONLY FOR TWO IS AN EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT WHICH WE LOOK AT FRAUD MISAPPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS. OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES -- OUR REPORT ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS -- BUT IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT TO CALL FOR THAT REVIEW BASED ON A SET OF ALLEGATIONS -- BEFORE WE WOULD DO THAT TYPE OF WORK -- AND SO AND EVEN WHEN WE DO THAT WORK WE WOULDN'T MAKE THAT ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WE WOULD IDENTIFY. EVIDENCE THAT WOULD THEN WE WOULD TURN OVER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THEM TO ACT UPON -- THERE WERE. A NUMBER OF PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT WE THINK WERE MISLEADING. THAT BEST WHERE THERE WAS -- EXTENSIVE INTER FUND BORROWING THAT WAS NOT RECORDED IS BORROWING. SO MONEY TAKEN FROM ARE NOT TAKEN STOP APPROPRIATE TERM MONEY TRANSFERRED FROM. SELF INSURED FUNDS TO THE GENERAL FUND TO HELP BOOST UP THE GENERAL FUND STATUS -- FROM -- A A HEALTH. THIS CALL HEALTH STANDPOINT. AND THOSE LOANS IF YOU WILL I'M USING THE WORD LONG. YOU KNOW FAIRLY BROADLY HERE ON THAT TRANSFER LONG WAS THAT TRANSFER WAS NOT RECORDED AS A LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND. WHICH ONE DID THEN HAVE SHOWN UP ON A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL REPORTS IS THE GENERAL FUND HAVING DEBT. YEAH HE'S PRETTY SIMPLE. ACCOUNTING SO BUT BUT WHAT WHAT FOR WHAT PURPOSE TO THOSE THOSE -- THOSE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MANAGE YOUR MUST A MORE ROBUST BALLOT SHE WHICH MEANS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE OTHER. MORE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW FINANCIAL DECISIONS RIGHT. A MORE ROBUST FUND BALANCE NOT BALLOT SHE BUT FUND BALANCE FOR THE GENERAL FUND. THESE ARE FISCAL OFFICERS OF THE DISTRICT. WELL AND WHAT MOTIVATION WHEN THEY HAVE TO DO SUCH A THING -- SIMPLY TO HAVE THE DISTRICTS FISCAL HEALTH WORK BETTER THAN IT WAS. THIRD THERE IS ACTUALLY NO ALLEGATION OR EVIDENCE OF ANY PERSONAL GAIN. IN IN ANYTHING WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE DISTRICT COURT ANY. CONVERSATION WE HAVE ALMOST A WEEKLY IN FACT WE'RE PART OF A WEEKLY CONVERSATION IN THE DISTRICT. NEVER HAS THERE BEEN AN ALLEGATION OF ANY QUE. ARE THOSE EMPLOYEES STILL EMPLOYED BY THE DISTRICT THE MAIN ONE IS NOT NOW. THEY WERE -- CONTRACT WAS BOUGHT OUT ROUGHLY A YEAR AGO BUT HE ME YOU MEAN THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT OR A CONTRACT OR NO THE AND IN AN EMPLOYEE. THIS EMPLOYEE HAD A CON AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. AND WHY WOULD EMPLOYEE OF THE DISTRICT HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTROVERSY SENIOR EXECUTIVE STAFF HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS THREE YEAR SUPERINTENDENT FAIRLY TYPICAL TO HAVE A THREE YEAR CONTRACT AS AN EXAMPLE. THE MOST OF THESE ACTIONS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING FUNCTION HAVE A CHECK AND BALANCE TO THEM RIGHT. SO THAT NO ONE PERSON EVER CAN MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT SOMEBODY ELSE HAVING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT. SO WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PERSON INVOLVED THAT MEANS THAT AT LEAST ONE PERSON INVOLVED IN THIS FRAUD. I STILL EMPLOYED BY THE DISTRICT. SO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE TERM FRAUD I THINK IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE PENAL CODE IT'S THAT THERE'S SOME PERSONAL GAIN AND AGAIN THERE'S BEEN NO ALLEGATIONS OF THAT. IS THERE A SIZEABLE BUSINESS OFFICE TEAM IN THE DISTRICT AND HAS BEEN YES -- THERE STILL IS -- A SIZEABLE STAFF THERE I'M DOING A TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS. THE EXAMPLE OF THE INTER FUND TRANSFERS I WOULD SAY WAS DONE AND VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL DIDN'T INVOLVE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. I THANK YOU. LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THE AUDIT IS THE IS THE AUDIT CONTRACT CHANGED. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT -- BECAUSE THE AUDIT THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR WOULD REPRESENT THE REPORT NOT TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OR TO TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM TO THE LORD. SO THE FAILURE OF THE AUDIT TEAM. TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE. THESE -- DISCREPANCIES -- POTENTIALLY PRECLUDED THE BOARD FROM HAVING THE INFORMATION. YES SIR OR THE TRUSTEE IN THIS CASE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION BECAUSE YES SIR AND IT GOES DEEPER THAN THE AUTO WOULD BE THE BUDGET. THE ON OUTDATED AXLES THE IN ARMOR PORTS ALL OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH UNDER THIS BIG UMBRELLA THAT WE CALL AB TWELVE HUNDRED THAT INVOLVES OVERSIGHT. OF BOOK BEFORE WE FINISH WITH THIS SEGMENT AND I I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW. OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS A LEGISLATURE. TO A FURTHER EMPOWER AND STRENGTHEN THIS PROCESS TO TRY TO PREVENT -- SITUATIONS LIKE WE ARE NOW HEARING ABOUT -- IN OAKLAND SO YOU DON'T NEED TO COVER IT NOW BUT OKAY SOME POINT. WELL WALL DRESS IT NOW I'M I THINK ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN FORTY GOES A LONG WAYS -- IT BRINGS THAT OVERSIGHT DOWN LOCAL -- AS A YOU KNOW OPENS NOT FAR FROM SACRAMENTO BUT IN THE WOOD IS FAR FROM SACRAMENTO -- AND FROM A DAILY OPERATIONS STANDPOINT IT BRINGS IT LOCAL -- THE SO EIGHTEEN FORTY ADDRESSES A NUMBER THE PIECES WE ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT TRUSTEE IN OAKLAND RIGHT NOW WHO IS FUNCTIONING AS IN THE TRUSTEES INTENDED TO FUNCTION. AND IS GETTING INTO THE NITTY GRITTY AS HAT HAS A MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY CONVERSATION WITH THE DISTRICT. ARE REQUIRES THAT THEY SEE WHAT GOES TO THE BOARD I HAD A TIME SO THEY CAN QUESTION IT THEY REVIEW IT THEY'VE BEEN VERY THOROUGH ABOUT THAT. THEY PARTICIPATE IN OUR WEEKLY OR EVERY OTHER WEEK CONVERSE -- PHONE CONFERENCES WITH THE DISTRICT CAN -- OFTEN TIMES -- CD E. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF ICE ON THIS I THINK THERE WAS A LOT LEARNED IN THE ROLE OF A STATE TRUSTEE EIGHTEEN FORTIES I INDICATED. ADDRESS AS PART OF THE OUT THERE NOW SIGNED BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. SUBJECT TO A LIST THAT WE PUT THAT WE WOULD IDENTIFY AND THAT -- I THINK THOSE ARE ALL ELEMENTS THAT STRENGTH IN THE PROCESS AND I'M SURE AUDITORS LEARNED A LOT. THOSE THAT DO SCHOOL DISTRICT AUDITS I SUSPECT THEY HAVE SPECIAL BASED ON A CRITICISM YES. THANK YOU SIR YOU'RE WELCOME. I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE NEXT SECTION -- SCHOOL DISTRICT FISCAL EMERGENCIES OBVIOUSLY INGLEWOOD CONTINUES A SEVENTH COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS ACTUALLY UNDER WAY SO FOR THE COMMITTEE'S BENEFIT WHEN A DISTRICT TAKES AN EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE. LOSES ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ONE OF THE TASKS ASSIGNED TO US IS THE U. S. ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND IN THAT COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW WE LOOK AT FIVE AREAS OUTLINED IN CODE. ON THOSE AREAS ARE OBVIOUSLY FISCAL [inaudible] FACILITIES PERSONNEL. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. AND GOVERNMENT SLASH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. AND WE ISSUE A VERY LARGE REPORT -- EACH SUMMER ON THE PROGRESS THE DISTRICTS MAKING THERE IS A SCORING RUBRIC THAT GOES WITH THE REPORT -- THE DISTRICT IS SLOWLY MAKING PROGRESS IT'S ACTUALLY MADE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE AREA OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT IN THE AREA OF GOVERNANCE. BOMB IT HAS MADE MINIMAL PROGRESS ON TO DATE AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER IN THE AREA. OF FINANCES AND FACILITIES -- AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN THE AREA FACILITIES THOUGH IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE VIçT -- HAS BEEN -- INVOLVED DAILY THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PRODUCED A DRAFT. OF FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION REPORT THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT ONCE SERVED OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND KIDS NOW SERVING LESS THAN EIGHT THOUSAND SO THEY HAVE ACCESS FACILITIES. AND THEY HAVE -- I REVIEWED IN A MEETING AND INGLEWOOD LAST WEEK THE MOST RECENT DRAFT ON THAT THEY'VE COME UP WITH IS VERY THOUGHTFUL -- ADDRESSES -- REALLY THE NEED AND THE SUPPORT THE DISTRICT NEEDS MOVING FORWARD BY WAY OF FACILITIES -- SWEETWATER UNION -- I THINK GENERALLY I WOULD SAY A IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS WERE STARTING TO TURN THE CORNER AND SEEING PROGRESS IN SWEETWATER -- THIS WAS NOT ON TO ORDERS NOT ON OUR RADAR SCREEN -- UP TOLD THE LAST WEEK OF AUGUST WHEN THEY CLOSE THEIR BOOKS FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR -- IS BANNED RAN THEIR TRIAL BALANCE IS WHEN THEY SAW THAT THERE ESTIMATED POSITIVE. FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE WAS ACTUALLY A NEGATIVE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR FUND-BALANCE TO A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR SWING -- CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL DIRECTOR FISCAL PAYROLL MANAGER ALL RETIRING. AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAD ALREADY RECRUITED THEIR NEW CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL. BOMB WHO'D STARTED THAT WEEK IN WAS THE ONE THAT DISCOVERED THE DISCREPANCY. DISTRICT IS GOT WENT INTO CRISIS MODE -- I WOULD SAY THROUGH JANUARY WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO REALLY GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR PROBLEM. NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE NOW A NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE BUT THEY ALSO CARRIED OVER THERE BUDGET FROM LAST YEAR. WHICH IS WHAT CREATED THE NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE SO IT HAD OVERSTATED EIGHTY A IN IT. HAD UNDERSTATED SALARIES AND BENEFITS IN IT. AND SO TO THE TUNE OF THIRTY PLUS MILLION ON TOP OF A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE -- ALL THIS TO COME TO LIGHT AT THE LAST YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE CLOSING YOUR BOOKS BASICALLY -- IS VERY UNUSUAL -- WE SHOULD REPORT IN DECEMBER OF FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A A NUMBER OF CONCERNS IN THE DISTRICT -- GETTING THEIR ATTENTION THE BOARD'S ATTENTION IN THIS SENIOR MINISTRATIONS ATTENTION UNDERSTAND THE MAGNET THE PROBLEM IS IS BEEN -- HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE BUT I'D SAY THEY DID SO ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO. AND THEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AS THEY BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT -- HAVE MADE PROGRESS. AND I EXPECT THINGS THEY ARE ON TRACK -- WE ARE -- AND ALL SPEAK TO THIS IN JUST A SECOND WE ARE IN THE DISTRICT RIGHT NOW -- FOLLOWING UP ON ALLEGATIONS OF ILLEGAL FISCAL PRACTICES AND SO WE ARE CONDUCTING GETTING READY TO JUST START AN EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT -- IN THAT DISTRICT ALL SPEAK TO THAT A MOMENT. SACRAMENTO CITY -- YOU READ A LOT ABOUT -- IN THE SACKB. MOST OF THAT HAS BEEN FAIRLY ACCURATE REPORTING -- WE DID A FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS THERE IN THE FALL REPORTED IN DECEMBER -- I HAVE STATE ACTIVELY INVOLVED OUR STAFF HAS -- WITH THE DISTRICT WITHOUT REALLY HAVING AN OFFICIAL ROLE IN THE COUNTY OFFICE SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME. OF THE DISTRICT -- HAS BEEN -- LET'S SEE UP THROUGH DECEMBER HAD FORECASTED TO RUN OUT OF CASH NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN WE UPDATED OUT RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS WERE NOW EXPECTING THAT TO BE APRIL OF TWENTY PROBABLY HAVE TWO MONTHS OF NEGATIVE CASH JUNE OF TWENTY UP POSITIVE MONTH. BUT ALL OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS CURRENTLY FORECAST TO HAVE NEGATIVE CASH. AND SO -- IF YOU WILL THE THE CRITICAL TIMEPIECES MOVED OUT THEY HAVE AN ACT THEY HAVE VOTED ON AND APPROVED -- SEVERAL CUTS BUT COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT TO ULTIMATELY TURNED THE CORNER BUT IT'S THE RESULT OF THOSE INITIAL CUTS THAT MOVES. THE NEGATIVE CASH BALANCE OUT A FEW MONTHS JUST FINE WE'VE COVERED OVER AND WE TALKED ABOUT LA SO WITH RESPECT TO SAID SACRAMENTO. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. HAVE IF YOU OR YOUR AGENCY BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE BEEN SEVERAL ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER INCLUDING A OP ED TODAY THAT. TALK ABOUT -- BENEFITS OR SALARIES OR VARIOUS THINGS. TO BE FAIRLY SIMPLE ABOUT IT NUMBER ONE THERE'S THERE'S A LONG HISTORY IN THE DISTRICT -- PROBABLY OF INACTION -- WITHIN DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE ITEMS BUT REALLY THE THE CURRENT ISSUE IS DRIVEN BY -- THE DISTRICT ENTERING INTO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS -- TEACHER PARTNERS IN NOVEMBER OF SEVENTEEN WE ARE -- NOT IN A POSITION IN ANY WAY TO CRITICIZE THAT AGREEMENT WE GENERALLY WOULD SAY AND WE'D SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OAKLAND'S WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT L. A.'S. IF THAT'S WHAT THE RIGHT THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT WERE THE RIGHT THINGS FOR THE DISTRICT AND IT'S IN THIS CASE TEACHERS. WHO LET'S BE HONEST DO MOST OF THE WORK IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ALMOST ALL THE WORK IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT? THEN THAT'S THE RIGHT THING -- BUT WHEN YOU AGREE TO THOSE TERMS AND AS A BOARD APPROVED THOSE KNOWING YOU CAN'T AFFORD ON THEN THE SUBJECT YOU HAVE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE. BOARD MEMBERS A FIDUCIARY IS FOR THEIR DISTRICT THAT'S THE ROLE AS TRUSTEES. AND IN THIS DISTRICTS CASE THEY APPROVE THE AGREEMENT KNOWING THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. AND THAT IS NOW ROUGHLY A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THEY'RE JUST NOW STARTING. TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CUTS ASSOCIATE TO THAT WHAT'S THE DELTA. THE DELTA A NATIONALLY IS IN THE THAT A FAIR QUESTION YES IT IS AND I SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER. ALTHOUGH IT I THINK HAS CHANGED RECENTLY MICHELLE THE RECALL THE FIRST YEAR. IT MOVES UP INTO THE SIXTY MILLION RANGE OVER THREE YEARS. YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR. YEAH IT'S PRETTY HIGH HIGH THIRTIES LOW FORTIES IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN ESCALATES UP. TO SIXTY IN THE THIRD YEAR SO THE CONCEPT IS IF YOU APPROVE AN AGREEMENT LIKE THAT THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE THIRTY TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CUTS ELSEWHERE YES AND THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN MAY THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN MADE. ONLY A SMALL PORTION JUST IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE -- LET ME THE END YOU KNOW FROM -- MEDIA REPORTING THERE'S A TALK OF A STRIKE AND SO ON THIS YOU SHOULD NOT VIEW A STRIKE IN SACRAMENTO CITY. UNIFIED AS THE SAME ISSUES AS LA OR OAKLAND VERY DIFFERENT RIGHT STRIKE IN SACRAMENTO CITY IS OVER THAT VERY RECENT COLLECTIVE BUT RECENT AGREEMENT. AND THE US SO SHE ASIANS CLAIM THAT THE DISTRICT -- IS NOT MEETING ITS AGREEMENT. RIGHT THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THEN. WE CAN'T COME TO TERMS AND WE WORK THROUGH THE IMPASSE PROCESS WE WORK THROUGH THE FACT FINDING PROCESS. MEDIATION ALL THOSE THINGS WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE STEPS IN TECHNICALLY SEXY DOESN'T. THE ASSOCIATION DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS THEY WOULD JUST SIMPLY CLAIM THAT THE CONTRACT IS NOT BEEN HONORED. THE OKAY I I TOTALLY GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE THE TERMS OF THE DISAGREEMENT BUT ONE THING THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY -- SIMILAR IN BOTH CASES IS. D. AT THE SIRIUS EXTENT TO WHICH ON THERE ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT. ARE WITH THEIR BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT ARE -- CONSIDERING MORE GENEROUS THAN WHAT OTHER AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS OFFER ANOTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. YES SENATOR KARENNA RARY SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO CERTIFICATE EMPLOYEES TEACHERS AND OTHERS IN THAT BARGAINING UNIT. THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS ARE IN POST EMPLOYMENT ARE. IN THE ASSOCIATE OPPOSED EMPLOYMENT AS WELL FOR ALL OUR NOT COMPARE BULL THEY ARE IF YOU WILL OFF THE CHART TO BE VERY CANDID COMPARED TO THEIR SURROUNDING DISTRICTS THEIR PEER GROUPS -- THAT IS [inaudible] THAT IS. THE LA HAS AT ISSUE WITH OPEN UP WITH THE POST EMPLOYMENT -- BUT NOT GENERALLY SPEAKING WITH ITS OVERALL HEALTH BENEFITS -- OAKLAND WAS ALSO NOT COMPARISON WILL COMPARE WILL BUT I WAS ON THE LOWER END -- SO IN SACKS CITY A ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR HEALTH PLAN. THE CASA DISTRICT ROUGHLY THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AND EMPLOYEE PER YEAR. RIGHT COMPARES TO ALL THEIR OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ONE PARTICULAR PLANT BUT HAVE ACCESS TO A CHOICE OF OTHER PLANS. THE COSTS ON THE MORE NORMAL. PHAM. FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR AND SO FOR FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THE DISTRICT HIS PAIN A SUBSTANTIAL A MUCH HIGHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE TUNE OF AROUND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR [inaudible] IN. IN IN FAIRNESS THOUGH TO BOTH PARTIES THEY BOTH IN THEIR AGREEMENT A KNOWLEDGE THAT AND AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER -- TO ADDRESS THAT -- HOWEVER THE AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF THE DISPUTE -- THE THE TEACHERS AGREEMENT. BASICALLY WOULD BE TO USE THE SAVINGS BY ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE TO LOWER CLASS SIZE INVEST IN MORE COUNSELORS NURSES AND SO ON THE DISTRICTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE AGREEMENT THOUGH SAYS WERE IN FISCAL DSTRESS. AND WE REALLY NEED THE SAVINGS TO GO TO IF YOU WILL THE BOTTOM LINE TO HELP BALANCE. RIGHT. AND SO -- THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK OUT -- AND TO DATE THAT HASN'T. MR HERE AND FOLLOW UP THIS IS A ANY REFERRING TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AGREEMENT THE NOVEMBER. WHERE MY NOVEMBER SEVENTEEN YES IF I'M IN THE ONE THAT? THEY WENT TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. AND AS NOTED EARLIER IT YOU INDICATE GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT PROCESS AS TO WHY. SO BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO THESE -- BUT BUT THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO ANY KIND OF SUBSEQUENT -- RECONCILIATION. GIVEN THE BUDGET PRESSURES THAT THAT AGREEMENT WOULD CREATE. THAT'S CORRECT SIR SO THE SO THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE STANDING HERE IN TERMS OF SAYING WE NEGOTIATE GOOD FAITH. YOU YOU MADE THAT AGREEMENT WITH US RIGHT AND NOW YOU WANT TO GO BACK IN AND RAVEL IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT MADE PEOPLE MAY FEEL ABOUT THE THE COMPENSATION OF THE BENEFITS PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE GETTING UNDER IT. THEY AGREED TO IT. HI AND SO I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT TO DO -- BUT TO GO BACK AND SAY WELL WHAT WITH THE TRUSTEES -- THINKING. WHEN THEY MADE THAT AGREEMENT? WELL. I CAN'T SPECULATE ON WHAT THEY WERE THINKING WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT IT WAS VERY. IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE AGREEMENT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. DID A REVIEW OF THE DISCLOSURE THE GRAMINIS REQUIRED BY LAW COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT STOOD AT THE PODIUM IN THE BOARD ROOM AND SAID AHEAD OF THEIR APPROVAL AGREEMENT YOU CANNOT AFFORD THIS. SHORTLY THERE AFTER THEIR FIRST IN ARMOR PORT. ON THE DATA REFLECTED THEY COULD AFFORD IT SUBSEQUENT. SECOND IN A REPORT A YEAR AGO THEY COULDN'T. THAT SAME INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE WHAT IT DID IS IT LEFT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT NO CHOICE IT WHEN THEY SUBMITTED THE BUDGET FOR THE CRRENT YEAR. LAST JUNE. THAT'S WHEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SAID I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE -- I NEED TO DISAPPROVE YOUR BUDGET. THAT'S WHAT THEN PUT THEM IN ON THIS PATH OR THE WE CAME INTO THE FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS AND THERE'S BEEN A DAILY ENGAGEMENTS -- SEXY. OKAY -- HARDEST DAY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THAT I MEAN PRAGMATICALLY WHY WITH THOSE CHOICES MADE -- DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THANK YOU. WAS TO FIND GIVEN THE CORE MISSION OF THE DISTRICT -- IS IT POSSIBLE TO CUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF A BUDGET. TO RIGHT THE SHIP. BEEN EASIER IF THEY'D START A YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- VERY CANDIDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALLER NUMBER AND EVERY CUT WOULD HAVE HAD MORE OF AN IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THE BOTTOM LINE -- THIS IS NOT A SMALL DISTRICTS GOOD SIZED DISTRICT OBVIOUSLY. SIXTY MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY -- LARGE PERCENTAGE. THEY CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH THEIR PARTNERS AND THAT WOULD NOT ONLY BE THE TEACHERS BUT ALL OF THEIR LABOR PARTNERS -- IN AGREEING -- TO SOME TYPE OF DIFFERENT WHETHER THAT'S CLASS SIZE WHETHER IT'S STAFFING RATIOS OF SOME KIND. ON THE DISTRICT IF I RECALL SPENDS THE BETTER PART OF 90% -- ALL OF THEIR BUDGET ON SALARIES AND BENEFITS. MORE TYPICAL DISTRICTS RUNS ABOUT 85% A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BALANCE THERE THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH NON SALARIES AND BENEFITS. IN THIS CASE THOUGH -- THERE -- MOST SIGNIFICANT -- OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING WOULD BE WITH HOURS OF THAT OFFICE AND THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS THAT THE IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE ARE CONCERNED. FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT THE NATURE OF BENEFITS THAT THEY THE DISTRICT NEGOTIATES FOR ITS TEACHERS. BUT WHETHER RATHER DO THEY NEGOTIATE FOR A CERTAIN SET OF BENEFITS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OVER OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH. AND ARE THERE IS THE DISTRICT WILLING TO MAKE WHATEVER CUTS ARE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. YES MY QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET AND DELIVER RUN YOUR CORE -- FUNCTION WHICH IS TO EDUCATE. YOUNG PEOPLE IN CASE YOU TWELVE IF I IMPLIED ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO HI. WOULDN'T THAT WOULD BE WRONG IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE MAJORITY OF ELEVEN HER SCHOOL DISTRICTS OUT THERE FACE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS EACH DAY THEIR BOARDS ULTIMATELY STEP UP FROM PRIORITIZE -- YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON AND THEY HAVE TO LET SOME OTHER PRIORITIES GO -- RIGHT THE CONCERN HERE IS THE LENGTH OF TIME. THE KNOWLEDGE NUMBER ONE THAT THEY HAD GOING IN. THE LENGTH OF TIME IT'S TAKEN TO ACT -- THE RELATIONSHIP THIS IS US THIS IS A INDUSTRY IF I CAN USE THAT TERM A BUSINESS THAT IS BUILT ON RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT. STARTS WITH THE STUDENT AND THE TEACHER THE ADULT THAT THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH IN THE CLASSROOM -- ON THE FIELD THAT RELATIONSHIP IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT MOVES ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL OF THE LEVELS OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND FUNCTIONS OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT. ULTIMATELY COMING TO THE BOARD AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR LABOR PARTNERS -- AND THAT'S NOT A RELATION. CURRENTLY NOT A WORKING RELATIONSHIP -- WITH THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THERE'S A STRONGER WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR OTHER. LABOR PARTNERS IN THE DISTRICT BUT WE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY KNOW AROUND HERE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CUT. THE OTHER DECISIONS ARE A LITTLE EASIER BUT CUTTING IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS DIFFUSER GLAZER OR JUST ANOTHER ONE MORE FOLLOW UP -- AND I KNOW WHAT THIS WILL BE A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR YOU BUT SO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WHAT APPEARS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLE CONDUCT ON THE BACK HALF OF THE TRUSTEES TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY THEN DID NOT TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY. TO TO PERFORM KEEP THE DISTRICT FISCALLY SOFT RICE THE ACTIONS I WOULD FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS THAT I WOULD FOCUS ON SO WELL. ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN POLICY OR LAW. THAT CAN HELP THIS TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE TOOLS THAT. THAT YOU DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT WE NEED TO STOP THIS TYPE OF IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD. SENATOR IT IT'S NOT RARE THAT THIS HAPPENS IT HAPPENS PROBABLY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE WOULD ALL ACKNOWLEDGE. HOWEVER MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS STEP UP AND ULTIMATELY DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHICH IS WHY WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT RIGHT. INTERN INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING AGREE TO THROUGH THE PROCESS AT THE TABLE -- AND FOLLOWING THE TENANTS OF WHETHER IT'S TRADITIONAL BARGAINING OR INTEREST BASED BARGAINING -- AND GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY CRITICAL -- AND SOMETIMES. AGREEMENTS REACH THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL THE PARTIES HOPEFULLY MAINLY THE STUDENTS THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TO SERVE -- AND AND SOME ADJUSTMENTS HAVE TO BE MADE MOST SPORTS STEP UP AND MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS -- DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY -- SO IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION WE WOULD BE. CRAFTING SOME TYPE OF LEGISLATION OR CONTROL FOR A VERY FEW FOLKS -- THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT -- I MAYBE IN THIS CASE IT WOULDN'T BE. SOME ADDED AUTHORITY FOR FIX MATTER WOULD BE ADDED AUTHORITY FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH THE REVIEW THE BUDGET IN A REPORT AND THE REVIEW. OF THE ANALYSIS DONE ON A THE DISCLOSURE AROUND THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO STRENGTHENING THAT PROCESS MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY -- WITH RESPECT TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ROLE -- BUT IN THIS CASE I HAVE TO SAY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT DID EVERYTHING. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY DID THEIR NOW SAYS THEY WENT TO THE BOARD MEAN THEY STOOD THERE AND THEY INFORMED THE BOARD OF THE ANALYSIS EIGHT INCHES SEND THE LETTER. THEY WERE PRESENT -- AND THEY HAVE RENEWED THAT EACH STEP OF THE WAY IN THE PROCESS -- SO THE ONLY ADDITIONAL CONTROL POINT WOULD BE SOMEONE FORTY FOR THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS SAY NO AND THAT'S TO BE CANDID THAT THAT'S KIND OF PORTION -- THE LINE OR NOT MAYBE NOT PORTION OF IT BRING IT BRING IT IN WHERE WE'VE WE'VE NOT GONE IN THE PAST. THE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS THAT -- WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE CARGOES OVER THE CLIFF AND CRASHES. BEFORE WE CAN STEP IN TO TRY TO CREATE SOME ORDER IN FISCAL SANITY THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO CREATE GUARDRAILS TO STOP A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE SACRAMENTO -- FROM GETTING FROM GOING OVER THE CLIFF THAT WOULD USE THE INTERNET IN MANY RESPECTS YES AND I CAN GIVE YOU TWO OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT -- MONTEBELLO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO -- ALLEN ROCK IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IN BOTH CASES THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT STOOD UP AND SAID. I'M GOING TO KIND OF TAKE CONTROL HERE AND FOR SOME THINGS UPON YOU. YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN TAKE ME TO COURT AND SEE IF A JUDGE WILL STOP ME -- BOTH DISTRICTS HAVE. RELUCTANTLY HE ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND WE SEE IMPROVEMENT ALLEN ROCK ACTUALLY TURNING STARTING TO TURN THE CORNER. MALIK MONTEBELLO STILL A WAYS OFF BUT BUT HAVE STABILIZE KIND OF WHERE THEY'RE AT JUST STILL HAVE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TO GO -- SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- OF PROCESS. WHEN A DISTRICT IS? QUALIFIED OR NEGATIVE THE COUNTY HAS THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE -- THE INTERVENTION UNDER AB TWELVE HUNDRED IS MEANT TO BE PROGRESSIVE. JUST AS THE CERTIFICATIONS ARE POSITIVE TO QUALIFY DO NEGATIVE THEIR INTERVENTIONS MEANT TO BE PROGRESSIVE BASED ON THE NEED. AND WHETHER THE DISTRICTS OUT. THAT INTERVENTION SHY OF STATE INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES THE ASSIGNMENT OF A FISCAL ADVISER WITH THE UNIVERSE AND AUTHORITY. TO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT CAN DO THAT TODAY. SO STAY IN RESENT AUTHORITY WOULD BE THAT FISCAL ADVISOR HELPS TO DISTRICT DEVELOP A FISCAL STABILIZATION PLAN. AND IF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTED BOARD OF EDUCATION TAKES ANY ACTION THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THAT FISCAL PLAN THE TRIP THE FISCAL VISOR CAN STAY OR RESCIND THEIR ACTION. HOWEVER AS YOU APPRECIATE YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO HAVE SOME STATE RESENT SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF MONTEBELLO. BONTA BELL CURRENTLY AND FOR OVER TWO YEARS HAS HAD A VACANCY IS IS CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL. FOR OVER A YEAR CHIEF PERSONNEL FISHEL. I THINK FOR OVER A YEAR CHIEF PURCHASING OFFICIAL I BELIEVE ALSO OVER A YEAR CHIEF FACILITIES OFFICIAL ALL AREAS. OF DISTRESS IN THE DISTRICT. CENTER DOESN'T APPLY IF THE BOARD NEVER HIRES OR HIGHER IS THE WRONG PERSON IT WOULD APPLY. RIGHT BUT THE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO IN AND PUT SOMEBODY IN THOSE CHAIRS TO HELP THE DISTRICT. THE STATE WAS IN THOSE VERY CRITICAL POSITIONS SO WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE CREATIVE THIS YEAR -- IN MNTEBELLO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE COUNTIES BUT LEADERSHIP THEY'VE APPOINTED FIVE FISCAL ADVISORS. TYPICALLY ONE THIS IS APPOINTED RIGHT. SO ONE IS THERE OVERSEEING THE WHOLE. ONE IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS ONE ON THE PURCHASING OPERATIONS ONE ON THEH. R. OPERATIONS. AND THAT'S ALL IN ATTEMPT TO BEEF THIS UP DESPITE THE BOARDS AND WILLINGNESS TO DO WHAT. FRANKLY THEY'RE THERE TO DO. SO I GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES YOU KNOW SOME COUNTY SOUPS ARE WILLING TO PUSH THAT ENVELOPE RIGHT AND BASICALLY TELL A DISTRICT BOARD I'M DOING THIS YOU DON'T LIKE IT WE CAN. YOU KNOW WHAT A JUDGE DECIDE -- YOU KNOW AGAIN BACK TO YOUR QUESTION WAYS TO STRENGTHEN SOME OF THAT THERE'S THERE'S LIKELY SOME WAYS TO STRENGTHEN -- THAT ROLE IN CERTAIN. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE ON THE HOOK IF THERE'S BANKRUPTCY ALTERNATELY READING THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE IN THE BY DECISION AND ALL THE THINGS YOU CAME OUT THAT'S WHY FIGURE OUT WAS GREAT IN THE FIRST PLACE OR DESK. THAT'S CORRECT SIR IT'S REALLY TO AVOID OF THE NEED TO FILE. PROTECTION UNDER BANKRUPTCY -- SO -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE US BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION WE THE LEGISLATURE'S NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO GET THE AFTER OUR RIGHT BY STEPPING IN. AS THEIR POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE THEY'RE SUBJECT TO YOUR OF FORTY AND YOU'VE ALWAYS HISTORICALLY STEPPED IN AND PROVIDED. THE REESE THE CAST TEMPORARY CASH RESOURCES THEY NEED REMEMBER STATE EMERGENCY PREPARATION AS A BALANCE OUR BUDGET. IT PROVIDES THE CASH THEY NEED TO MEET PAYROLL IN THEIR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. THEY STILL HAVE THE WORK TO DO TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE BECAUSE SENATOR GLAZERS OF QUESTION AND COMMENT IN A THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I WOULD THINK FOR A COUNTY. SUPERINTENDENT TO GET INVOLVED AT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS STAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE BEST EQUIPPED TO NEGOTIATED AN MO YOU OR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. BOTH ON THE ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE AND ON THE ON THE TEACHING AND AND THE CLASSIFIED SIDE. NOT AT THE COUNTY OFFICE SO YOU'RE ALMOST. ROME WAS FORCED TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GLACIATION RICH MEANS. DEALING WITH THE CONTRACT IT'S BEEN APPROVED. PROPERLY OR NOT AND SO IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT WE NEED TO SEEMS TO ME WE NEED. TO TAKE A SNAPSHOT AND AND HOPEFULLY ALL FOUR TIRES ARE OFF THE ROAD JUST ONLY. TO WE GOT YOU'RE WELCOME. COMPLETELY AGREE SIR IN FACT INTRODUCING THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THAT PROCESS WOULD BE ALMOST A THIRD PARTY AND WOULD EVEN. POTENTIALLY. GET US INTO SOME UNFAIR BARGAINING UNFAIR LABOR -- TYPES OF THINGS SO ALLOW ME QUICKLY TO CONCLUDE SOLVENCY TRAIL -- SONG SEE TRENDS WE ARE SEEN THE THREE YEAR MULTI YOUR PROJECTION START TO FORECAST -- DEFICIT TRENDS -- IN DISTRICTS MORE DISTRICTS EACH TIME THEY PREPARE THESE -- AND DISTRICTS THE DISTRICT HAVE SOME WORK TO DO -- OBVIOUSLY IN THE OUT YEARS TO BALANCE THAT IS THAT ON THE EXPENSE SIDE OR ON THE REVENUE SIDE WE WELL THESE THE NET OF THE TWO SO WE'VE NOT. WE COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THAT ARE SO YOU CAN -- SO WHAT THIS REALLY IMPLIES A DEFICIT -- TRENDING IMPLIESTHAT EXPENSES ARE GOING UP BUT YEAR OVER YEAR AT A HIGHER RATE THAN REVENUE. IS GOING UP -- TO CLOSE AB ONE THIRTY NINE EXTRAORDINARY AUDITS -- WE SPOKE ABOUT THESE BRIEFLY THESE ARE WERE ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS RECEIVES AN ALLEGATION. THEY DO SOME DUE DILIGENCE ABOUT THAT AND IF THEY WANT TO PURSUE THE MATTER -- REGARDING FRAUD MISAPPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. THEY CAN COME TO FIX MATT -- AND WE WILL DO THAT WORK FOR THEM -- THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO COME TO US AND GO TO A PRIVATE PROVIDER PROVIDER. THE ADVANTAGE OF COMING TO US IS NUMBER ONE OUR STATE A PREPARATION PAYS FOR THAT WORK -- AND NUMBER TWO YOU GET SCHOOL BUSINESS EXPERTS NOT JUST -- ANY AUDITOR AUTHOR DOING ABOUT 75% OF OURSTAFF HAVE CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINER -- CERTIFICATIONS AND WE MAINTAIN WE HELP THEM MAINTAIN THOSE -- A YEAR AGO WE WERE EXPERIENCE IN A A ALL TIME PEAK -- OF THESE -- ACTIVITIES -- TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE WAS THE NUMBER A YEAR AGO THE PRIOR PEAK FOR US HAVE BEEN TEN SO WITH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PRIOR PEAK -- ALMOST BROUGHT US TO OUR KNEES -- THE THE FIRST BULLET HERE IS REALLY WE ARE BACK IN A MORE NORMAL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY RIGHT NOW -- WHICH IS I THINK GOOD NEWS -- WE HAVE ONE HIGH PROFILE REPORT THAT'LL BE RELEASED THE NEXT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS THAT DEALS WITH LEASE LEASE BACKS. A SUBJECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN ON SEVERAL TIMES. WE HAVE ONE HIGH FULL PROFILE AUDIT THAT IS JUST BEGINNING I ALLUDED TO THAT ONE EARLIER AND THAT WOULD BE -- THE THE SWEETWATER -- FOLLOW UP THAT THE COUNTY -- BASED ON OUR DECEMBER REPORT -- THE COUNTY HAS -- ASKED US -- TO GO A LITTLE DEEPER ON THEIR CASH BORROWING ON THERE BUDGET ENTRIES AND ON THEIR FAILURE TO POST PAYROLL FOR FOUR MONTHS LAST YEAR -- THAT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THEY'RE OUT YEAH I SO JUST GETTING BACK TO THIS WHOLE -- THE ISSUE OF OF THE POST SIMPLY BENEFITS DO YOU KNOW SOME GOOD AND BEST PRACTICES IN THIS AREA IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ON THAT THE THERE ARE. A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE FROM -- MEDICARE. TO COVER CALIFORNIA ACA. THAT ARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY EMPLOYER -- TO HALF THEIR THEIR RETIREES GET BENEFITS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT WHICH HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED SOME OF THESE CASES IS. SIGNIFICANT MORE GENEROUS THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THE EXISTING -- INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EVERYBODY AND THAT'S FINE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT WHAT THE DISTRICT CAN DO I WOULD PRESUME IS PURCHASED LIKE A SUPPLEMENT? THAT WOULD GET THEM SUBSTANTIVELY UP TO THE LEVEL OF WHATEVER WAS NEGOTIATED. AS A BENEFITS PACKAGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME STILL OFF LOAD A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COST ON TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHOEVER ELSE. IT IS OUT THERE THE TOPPING TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS. I'M ARE YOU SEE SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BETTER AS A AS A WAY OF SAVING MONEY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY THE WAY THAT WE JUST WE TAKE ALL THE SAVINGS WE ROLL IT INTO. YOU KNOW DECREASING CLASS SIZE AND HAVING MORE TEACHERS PAYING TEACHERS BETTER WHAT THEY DESERVE YOU PAID WHICH THEY ARE. YOU KNOW TOàN TO PAY. OUR AND ARE THERE OTHER DISTRICTS THAT ARE UTILIZING THIS AS A AS A AS A YOUR GOOD PRACTICES THIS BEING LOOKED AT AS A POTENTIAL WAY OF TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SERIOUS. FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ON THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST DISTRESSED THAT ARE NOW HAVING SERIOUS LABOR. UNREST ARE FACING. THE SENATOR -- I I WON'T BE THE EXPERT TO BE ABLE TO STE TELL YOU KIND OF WHAT THE TRENDING IS OUT THERE HOW MANY DISTRICTS ARE DOING IT BUT THE EXACT THING THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED ABOUT PARTNERING WITH PRE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PAIN. IF YOU WILL THE SUPPLEMENT OR THE DIFFERENCE INCLUDING FOR THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG SUPPLEMENT AND AND SO ON FOR EXAMPLE IN A MEDICARE IS A FAIRLY COMMON PRACTICE FOR YOUR POST EMPLOYMENT WERE BENEFITS ARE OFFERED -- ONCE YOU ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RIGHT -- AS AN EXCUSE ME MEDICARE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT'S A FAIRLY COMMON PRACTICE -- I THINK AND IT DOES SAVE CONSIDERABLE MONEY -- FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT THE FEW THAT ARE LEFT THAT OFFER LIFETIME BENEFITS -- GENERALLY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE APPROACH THEY'RE TAKING THOSE LIFETIME BENEFITS A OFFER AT LEAST THE EMPLOYEE. MAYBE NOT ALL PFAM NOT MAYBE NOT SPOUSE SIM KIDS AT THAT POINT ARE PART OF THE OTHER DEPENDENTS ARE PART OF THE PICTURE. BUT THE SPOUSE -- GENERALLY OFFER A PARTICULAR ACCESS TO A PLAN IT MAY BE A NOT UNCOMMON TO SAY THE LOWEST COST PLAN WE THE DISTRICT WILL PAY. UPON RETIREMENT THE LOWEST COST PLAN AND IF YOU WANT TO PAY UP. TO SAY PPO YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO THOSE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ABSOLUTELY DO EXIST ARE THEY THE MAJORITY OF THE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT -- I GIVE YOU A NUMBER THAT I A WAS. THAT I SAW IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE WERE DOING -- IN LA DURING THEIR LABOR DISPUTE -- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME. THEIR CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREES WAS IN THE EIGHT TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS RANGE COMPARED TO AN ACTIVE EMPLOYEE AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACTUALLY WAS HIGHER THAN THAT I BELIEVE. RANGE AND SO THAT TO ME THAT DIFFERENCE IN CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- MAYBE NOT QUITE THE DIFFERENCE YOU WERE YOU WERE THINKING THERE WOULD BE BUT THAT WOULD BE EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE WITH THAT THAT WAS IN AS LA. WHICH HAS OUR LARGEST OPEN A LIABILITY. AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO IS THERE A IS THERE AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO AND WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE STATE OF PLAY TO ADDRESS I MEAN THIS SEEMS TO BE OF OF A RELATIVE I MEAN OF ALL THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AT ALL UC'S GONNA HAVE TO FACE. THIS SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVELY. PAINLESS WAY OF ADDRESSING THEIR LONG TERM LIABILITIES IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T -- DOESN'T SUBSTANTIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY AND SERVICE OF BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THOSE RETIREES. SO I I I WOULDN'T IN ANY WAY DISAGREE WITH YOU -- I THINK IT'S THOUGH A TAD MORE COMPLICATED SO IN LA'S CASE -- AND I BELIEVE THIS APPLIES TO THEIR RETIREES -- BENEFITS AROUND -- I'M SORRY DECISIONS AROUND HEALTH BENEFITS ARE MADE BY A COMMITTEE OF WHICH THE DISTRICT IS. ONE MEMBER ONE VOICE ONE VOTE OF THAT COMMITTEE SO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WHICH GOVERNS THAT HAS. DEFERRED ALL DECISIONS ABOUT DETAILS AROUND HEALTH CARE -- AND PLANS AND PROGRAMS TO A HEALTH BENEFITS COMMITTEE THAT MEMBERSHIP IS MADE UP OF EACH OF THE LABOR PARTNERS AND THE DISTRICT AND THEY ALL HAVE AN EQUAL. VOTE. THEN WHAT THE BOARD DETERMINES IS -- THE MOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION THE DISTRICTS WILLING TO MAKE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN LA'S CASE THEY'VE COMMITTED TO THE OUT FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. I'M. BELIEVE WE'RE ON OUR THE LAST YEAR OF THAT THREE YEAR AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW -- I LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION THE COMMITTEE THEN FIGURES OUT THE PLANS BASED ON THEIR ENROLLMENT IN EACH PLAN AND AND COVERS -- A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF THE COST WITH THE DISTRICT'S CONTRIBUTION SO THAT LA YOU. WATER BEST EXAMPLE ON OPEN HAVE IT'S PROBABLY NOT ARE EASIEST EXAMPLE TO ADDRESS -- YOU'RE THINKING AROUND -- SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY TO IT -- BUT BECAUSE I CAN CIRCULATING STRUCTURE YES ALL RIGHT I CAN TAKE YOU TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. EXACTLY WHAT YEARS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE SAY ACTUALLY THE MOST DISTRICTS DO WHAT WE ARE TO SOME EXTENT I WOULD GUESS FOR THOSE THAT OFFER. POST SIXTY FIVE NOT POST EMPLOYMENT DON'T OFFER IT ALL SOME TAKE YOU OUT FROM RETIREMENT TO MEDICARE ELIGIBLE AND YOU JUST GO TO MEDICARE THEN YOU JUST GO ON RIGHT SOME TAKE YOU. SOME OFFER YOU A MINIMUM OF TEN YEARS IF YOU'RE RETIRED SIXTY FOUR THEY WILL CONTRIBUTE. IN ADDITION ON THE PLAN ONE YEAR WHEN THEY BECOME MEDICARE ELIGIBLE THEY'LL PAY. BUT THERE ARE THESE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT SENATE DISTRICT COULD PAY. FOR THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SUBSIDY OF A SIMILAR. BENEFIT PACKAGE TO WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY GETTING. BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR THE THE BASE. CARE TO BE COVERED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THAT. THE DISTRICT WHAT'S CALLED A SUPPLEMENT RIGHT. AND THAT THAT THAT PRODUCT EXISTENCE TO GET GETS AN OPTION THAT THAT YEAH IN A VERY FAIRLY MATURE MARKET RIGHT YES PRODUCT AREA. RIGHT YEAH SO I'M FASCINATED BY THE SELLING PROCESS SO DOES THE BOARD FIRST IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE WILLING. TO THAT THE BOARD IS WILLING TO DIRECT. TO POST EMPLOYMENT -- HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND THEN THE COMMITTEE WORKS WITHIN THAT DOLLAR FIGURE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PLAN OR IS OR THE WAY AROUND SO IT IS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT'S SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THE CONTRIBUTION. BUT THEY DO AT THE TABLE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THEY DON'T GET INTO THE PLAN DETAIL. AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLAN PROVIDERS AND WHAT LEVELS WHAT COPAY WOULD BE ALL THOSE THAT'S LEFT TO THE COMMITTEE. TO THE COMMITTEE THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN PROCESS AND DOES GET ALL TWENTY OF BUDGET RIGHT FUNDED BY THE DISTRICT THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THERE'S GOING TO BE. WHAT COPAYS WOULD BE WHAT A PAYROLL DEDUCTION MAY BE BUT IN LA THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS? AND THE RESULT WHICH IS THE AGREEMENT WOULD PROVIDE THAT THERE WOULD BE A HEALTH POST EMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFIT PROVIDED. AS A PRIMARY BENEFIT NOT AS A SUPPLEMENT THAT WOULD BE THE DECISION THEY MAKE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE I ASSUME AND ONE THEY MADE MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN DECIDE HOW TO FUNDED. AND THAT DECISION IS. THE PLANNED THE SPECIFICS ARE LEFT TO THE COMMITTEE INTERESTING. BEFORE THE QUESTIONS. ZERO WAS FINE IT'S ACTUALLY PRESENTATION WAS THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU DO FORWARD TO SEEING YOU BACK HERE. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES ON SCHOOL DISTRICT FISCAL PRESSURES THIS AS IN THE CASE OF THE LAST ITEM ARE -- IS AN INFORMATIONAL ONLY INFORMATION ONLY ITEM. SO IF I COULD ASK OUR PANELISTS TO JOIN US [inaudible] HELLO. GENERAL IF YOU WOULD TO IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR ME STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR. CORY COULD L. SO HE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC POLICY THE UNIVERSITY MISSOURI. I'M PAUL BERNAMA PHD STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. PAUL WARNED OF WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST ELEVEN ON A PRINCIPAL RESEARCH ECONOMIST WITH THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WHO WANTS TO START FIRST -- THINK WE'RE GONNA GO IN ORDER OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY AND GO FIRST SO -- THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC -- I'M GONNA START OFF BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE ADEQUACY STUDY THAT WE DID FOR GETTING DOWN TO FAX -- TO AND I THINK WE GOT ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES OF PEACE SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT BRIEF -- SO. THE CONDUCT OF THE AN ADEQUACY STUDY OR A COSTING OUT STUDY I KNOWN AND THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRY TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND AND CIRCUMSTANCES. FROM AND WHAT WE DID IS WE APPLIED WHAT'S CALLED THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT APPROACH WHICH RELIES ON EXPERT EDUCATORS OPINIONS. ON IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING SCHOOL LEVEL PROGRAMS FROM THE GROUND UP. FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCHOOL SETTINGS THAT IS WITH RESPECT TO SCALE HOW LARGE THE SCHOOL IS IN NEED. AND WHEN I SEE DESIGN THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS IS NOT JUST DESIGNING SCHOOL PROGRAMS AT SPECIFYING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY THAT IS THE STAFF IN THE NON PERSONNEL -- THAT WILL ACHIEVE. ADEQUACY -- AT A MINIMUM COST. SO. THAT'S WHAT WE DID NOW YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF ADEQUACY WHAT WE USED HERE WAS REALLY -- THE DEFINITION WAS ALLOWING ALL STUDENTS -- TO TO ACHIEVE THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS SET BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND ALSO HAVING ACCESS TO THE CONTENT STANDARDS. OKAY -- SO I I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. OUR FINDINGS -- WE WE CALCULATED THAT. IT WOULD BE A SIZEABLE AMOUNT. OF EXTRA SPENDING TO TO BRING -- TO TO OFFER AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION ALL STUDENTS -- ON THE ORDER OF ABOUT A 38% INCREASE OVER CURRENT EXPENDITURES AND THIS ISN'T SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- SO IN IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS WE WERE SPENDING ABOUT SIXTY SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION. PER YEAR -- IN IN THAT YEAR AND IT WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ABOVE THAT ANNUALLY. ANNUALLY IF WE BRING THAT INTO PER PUPIL TERMS -- IT WAS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR WAS ARE ARE. A STATEWIDE AVERAGE OPERATING SPENDING AND THAT WOULD GO UP TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS. OKAY -- WE ALSO DO DIDN'T STOP AT JUST LOOKING AT THE AGGREGATE STATEWIDE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE HOW THE THE THESE ADEQUACY GAPS THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARE PROJECTED ADEQUATE COST. AN ACTUAL SPENDING HOW MIGHT THAT VARY ACROSS DIFFERENT DISTRICTS WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS SO ONE OBVIOUS CUT IS WE SPLIT DISTRICTS INTO A COURT TILES BASED ON THE LEVEL OF POVERTY STUDENT POVERTY -- AS A PROXY BY STUDENT PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE LUNCH -- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE ADEQUACY GAP THAT IS THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROJECTED. ADEQUATE SPENDING AND ACTUAL SPENDING WAS LARGEST AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT IN THOSE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS AND LOWEST IN IN IN IN THE LOWER PART DISTRICTS SO WELL STATE WIDE WEEK WE ESTIMATED A 38% GAP -- THIS VERY IT'S THE LOW POVERTY DISTRICTS. HAD A GAP OF ABOUT 22% WHERE IS THE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS HAD A GAP ON AVERAGE OF ABOUT OKAY. WE WE WE ALSO DID A CUT BY -- LOCALES SO WE SPLIT UP DISTRICTS INTO URBAN -- INTO THE URBAN THE LARGE TOWNS THE THE THE THE SMALL TOWNS WILL SUBURB IN SMALL TOWNS AND AND RURAL REMOTE DISTRICTS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE RELATIVE. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADEQUATE AN ACTUAL SPENDING -- WAS REALLY HIGHEST AMONGST THE RURAL DISTRICT. AND LOWER AMONGST THE THE URBAN DISTRICTS. THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE PROJECTED AS ADEQUATE. SPENDING AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE UP TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION. WE GET WE CAN REFER TO THAT AS THE ADEQUACY GAP IF YOU WANT. IT WAS HIGHEST WE'RE IN IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS ON NOW THERE ARE FAR FEWER STUDENTS IN RURAL DISTRICTS THAN IN URBAN DISTRICTS SO IN. AT IN TERMS OF AN ABSOLUTE COST IT WOULD BE ABOUT THREE BILLION OF THAT THAT TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX BILLION EXTRA THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND. WHICH WOULD COVER ALL OF THE STUDENTS IN THE AND AND THE THE RURAL DISTRICTS AND THE SMALL TOWNS CATEGORY THE MOST RURAL DISTRICTS IN OUR IN OUR STATE -- SO THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES REALLY QUICKLY THEY THEY WERE NOT A STARK AS THE LOW TO THE HIGH POVERTY CONTRAST THAT I THAT I GAVE YOU SO THE BELOW. THE LOW HIGH CONTRAST WAS WAS -- COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ROLES AND THE URBAN DISTRICTS. WAS -- 46406% FOR THE RURAL DISTRICTS AND 37% FOR THE THEIR BUSINESSES NOT AS MUCH OF A CONTRACT AND THIS DOES THAT DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT OUR SYSTEM OF FUNDING THAT WE PUT IN PLACE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH. WHICH AT SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT COMPONENTS IS. IS IS EITHER INEFFECTIVE WORKS TOO SOON TO TELL I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S INEFFECTIVE BUT WE DID FURTHER ANALYSIS AND TO TO TO LOOK AT HOW OUR ADEQUACY PROJECTIONS -- WHAT TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPENDING AND POVERTY SPENDING IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SPENDING IN ENGLISH LEARNERS -- WHAT ARE PROJECTIONS WOULD SUGGEST THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BUT SHOULD BE ND THE THE RESULT OF THAT IS REALLY THAT THE L. C. F. F. IS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH? IN TERMS OF ITS DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTIES OR OR OR BEING PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH SO TO SPEAK SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IS INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE AT ALL. IT'S JUST -- ACCORDING TO THE ADEQUACY MODELS AND CALCULATIONS THAT WE MADE WE THINK IT COULD GO FURTHER I'M STILL IN SHOCK AT TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX BILLION IN. YEAH NOT THAT I DON'T THINK IT. IS NEEDED I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IN TERMS OF OUR STATE BUDGET REALITY ABSOLUTELY SO SO THERE IS - FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM STICKER SHOCK. WHEN WHEN YOU HEAR THAT FIGURE -- POINT SIX BILLION PER ANNUM IS IS IS ALSO A LOT SO WHAT WHAT WE DID IS WE TRY TO PUT INTO THE NATIONAL CONTEXT. AND INSTEAD OF SEEING IT AS SUCH A LARGE INCREASE FOR CALIFORNIA WE TRY TO PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE STATED THAT HAVE BEEN LAUDED AS FUNCTIONING REASONABLY WELL. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS THE ADEQUATE COSTS THAT WE PROJECTED. ARE LESS THAN THE STATE WHAT THE STATE'S. THE STATE'S WERE CURRENTLY SPENDING ON EDUCATION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTY SO. OUR ADEQUACY COSTS WERE 2% LESS THAN WHAT MASSACHUSETTS WAS CURRENTLY SPENDING IN THAT SAME YEAR -- FOR OTHER NORTHEASTERN DISTRICT IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER SO FOR VERMONT ARE ADEQUACY FIGURES WERE 15% LESS THAN THEIR ACTUAL SPENDING. FOR NEW JERSEY IT WAS 16% CONNECTICUT 17% AND OUR ADEQUACY FIGURES WERE 28% LOWER THAN WHAT NEW YORK WAS SPENDING. IN THE SAME YEAR ON A PER PUPIL BASIS THE DO YOU. DO YOU KNOW WHAT PROCESS HOW THE PERCENTAGES OF THE OVERALL STATE BUDGETS IN THOSE STATES -- I DON'T OFF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THAT INFORMATION IT'S PRETTY EASY TO FIND -- SO -- I I THINK I MET SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES ALL STOP RIGHT THERE BUT I'M I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS AS WE GO. ALONG QUESTIONS. I DIDN'T [inaudible] FOR OKAY. SURE -- WHO'S NEXT. I AM A SHEET HERE YEAH CORY COULD L. UNIVERSITY WAS VERY -- SO I MAY BE TALKING ABOUT -- THE PENSION ISSUES WITH CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE -- I PREPARED REMARKS WILL BE NO MINDS AND SPEND ALL MY TIME SAYING ARM. UP TO ALL OF YOU MIGHT AT MY BEST TO BE CONCISE IN MY REMARKS FROM THE FOCUS ON CAL STARS WHICH IS THE PLAN TO COVER CERTIFIED PERSONAL THE SCHOOLS THE THING TEACHERS. A CLASSIFIED PERSONALS SCHOOLS ARE COVERED BY CALPERS. CALPERS ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE TO CAL STAR IS A LOT OF THE SAME ISSUES I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT APPLY -- BUT CALPERS IS A SMALLER COST ITEM FOR SCHOOLS. I THINK WE ALL THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE RISING RAPIDLY IN CALIFORNIA THE RATE INCREASES ARE LEGISLATIVE TO BE HIGHEST FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. EMPLOYEES HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE MODEST INCREASES. THE SPECIFICS OF THESE CHANGES CAN BE FOUND IN MY REPORT AND THE DETAILS ARE ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE -- WITH THE RATE INCREASES A BACKDROP I HAVE THREE OBJECTIVES IN THESE BRIEF COMMENTS FIRST I'M GONNA EXPLAIN WHY PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE RISING IN CALIFORNIA. THEN I'M GONNA GIVE MY ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK FOR CAL STARS IN PARTICULAR IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES. AND THIRD EMPHASIZING THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALONE IN EXPERIENCING THESE RISING PENSION COSTS I WILL DISCUSS POSSIBLE POLICY RESPONSES. BASED OR OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WHY IS THIS HAPPENING. A THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS TWO WORDS PENSION THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT I CAN I THINK HOUSES BENEFITS ARE NOT IMPROVING WITH THESE RISING COSTS AND IN FACT NEW TEACHERS TODAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BENEFITS AND THEN. TEACHERS WHO ARE HIRED BEFORE TWENTY THIRTEEN I THINK THIS GIVE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE LABOR UNREST IN MANY DISTRICTS. DISTRICTS ARE BEING REQUIRED TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES ARE NOT THE BEEFICIARIES OF THESE THESE HIGHER COSTS. THE PENSION THAT CAN BE TRACED TO A VARIETY OF SOURCES BUT I WILL FOCUS ON JUST TO THAT ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THAT THERE ARE MANY LAYERS OF THE PENSION FINANCE ON IN BUT WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO ONLY A HANDFUL OF THINGS MATTER. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S UNDERPAID PENSION COSTS FOR MANY YEARS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT CALTRANS ACTUARIES CALCULATED HOW MUCH WAS REQUIRED TO PAY FOR FOR BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTING PARTISAN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE STATE? I DID NOT PAY THEFULL AMOUNT OVER THE YEARS THE UNDERPAYMENT A PENSION COSTS HAS RESULTED IN THE BUILD UP OF SUBSTANTIAL DEBT THE SAME WAY OF NOT PAYING YOUR CREDIT CARD BILL MAKE SURE. YOU GOT THIS BIG BALANCING USED A MORE MORE MONEY. SECOND THERE IS A CONSENSUS AMONG FINANCIAL ECONOMISTS BUT THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND MOST TV PENSION PLANS INCLUDING CAL STARS. ARE TOO OPTIMISTIC THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION IS THE ISSUE AND RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS. WHICH FOR ANY PENSION ONCE IN THE ROOM IS ALSO THE RATE OF THE PLAN DISCOUNTS LIABILITIES. FINANCIAL ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT THE RATE USED BY CALPERS ANOTHER SIMILAR PLANS IS TOO HIGH WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN IF ALL PAYMENTS ARE MADE. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE. ANY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS VIEW AS IN STATES WERE FULL PENSION PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE CONSISTENTLY PUBLIC PLAN STILL CARRY SUBSTANTIAL THAT. CONTRIBUTION RATE THE CALIPHATE ARISING DATA TODAY TO PAY DOWN THE LARGE THAT THAT IS A MASS OF THE PLAN. WHICH IS A THE LATEST ACTUARIAL VALUATION REPORT IS OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. THE NEXT IN A GOOD LONG TERM OUTLOOK. WE'RE IN THE PHASE IN PERIOD OF HIGHER PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATE HAS LEGISLATIVE BY ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION RATE TO CAL STARS AS A PERCENT OF TEACHER SALARIES WAS ABOUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR UNDER CURRENT PROJECTIONS WHEN THE RATES GOING TO PLATEAU IT'LL BE AT ABOUT 38% SO. MORE THAN DOUBLING. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK YOU GUYS ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT LATER TODAY WE GIVE MODEST RELIEF BUT EVEN IF PASSED IT WILL NOT MEETING WITH THE AFFECT THE FINAL RATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW AND ASSUMING ALL ACTUALLY ALSO ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS HOLD WHICH I THINK IS OPTIMISTIC THE FINEST ORACLE EVIDENCING HOUSES AND OTHER SIMILAR PLANS. THE HIGHER CONTRIBUTION RATES WILL BE REQUIRED THROUGH. TWENTY FORTY SIX AT WHICH POINT THE FALL BY ABOUT HALF BECAUSE THE DEBT WILL BE PAID DOWN. IF THE ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS ARE TOO OPTIMISTIC THERE ONLY TWO OPTIONS CONTRIBUTION RATES ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO HIGHER. OR THE TWENTY FORTY SIX AND POINT IS GOING TO BE EXTENDED. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THE WORLD WE ADOPTED THE THE GET WELL PLAN. THAT HAS A TWENTY FORTY SIX DATED AS I RECALL THAT'S CRACKERS AGO WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THAT PLAN I MEAN I GUESS YOUR POINT IS THAT IF THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP AND IT ACTUAL OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT IN THE CURRENT CONTRIBUTION RATES WHICH YOU. KNOW IS A BIG REASON OR HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE PENSION PLANS RIGHT NOW -- ARE NATURALLY HIGHER. AND IF IF THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS TEND TO BE. IN LINE BY TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX WE SHOULD HAVE THE PLAN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AT LEAST AS TO THOSE BENEFITS THAT ACCRUED UP TO TWENTY THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YES I IN PRINCIPLE IF THEY IF ACTUALLY ASSUMPTIONS ARE CORRECT BY TWENTY FORTY SIX THINGS WILL BE WILL BE FINE. THAT THE THE CONTRIBUTION RATE THE PLAN I'LL BE AROUND 20% TOTAL WHICH I THINK IS QUITE MANAGEABLE. A DOMINGUEZ SHOVE TRUCKS ARE FACT THAT'S NOT THAT'S GOOD CLARIFICATION. AND SO THAT'S MORE ABOUT LESS MORE LIKE WITH THE RATE WAS BEFORE THIS BIG COST INCREASES IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN OKAY SO ON IN THE LAST THING ON TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY IS POSSIBILITY SHOULD CALIFORNIA WISH TO INITIATE THE POLICY RESPONSE. FIRST MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S NOT ALONEIN FACING SUBSTANTIAL PENSION THAT THE TEACHERS PLAN. IN A RECENT ECONOMIC ARTICLE MYSELF IN A TEAM A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE ACROSS STATE PLANS IN THE U. S. -- AS A TWENTY THIRTEEN ABOUT 10% OF TEACHER SALARIES WERE BEING USED TO PAY DOWN PENSION THAT NUMBER IN CALIFORNIA COURT CALIFORNIA RIGHT OUTSIDE 18%. THIS IS THE ANNUAL DEBT SERVICING COST. DIRECTLY. FOR THEY WOULD BE PAID 80% THAT ARE MORE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE SAID THAT I THINK IS A BELIEVE THERE'S PROBABLY NOT ACCURATE IN PRINCIPLE YOU COULD TRY TO DO THAT BUT IT'S AYE. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE PAST THERE WOULD BE SO EIGHT CURRENTLY THERE IS 80% YOU MEAN THAT THEY'RE TAKING THAT OUT OF THEIR SALARIES THAT IT THAT THAT'S THE PRICE OF THE DEBT THAT'S THE PRICE OF A DEAD AS A THAT THAT IS A PERCENT OF TEACHER SALARIES WHOSE. ACTUALLY PAYING. IS NOT CLEAR SO YOU THINK THE THINK THE DISTRICTS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE PAY RAISE THEY WANT TO GET BECAUSE OF THIS. BUT MAYBE THEY ARE GETTING ALL THE PAY RAISES THEY CAN JUST PULL REVENUE THEY CAN COLLECT MORE TAXES OR YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF OUR WAY TO PAY FOR THIS BUT THE PRICE. OKAY AS A PERCENT OF TEACHERS SALARIES 18% JUST TO BE CLEAR THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. OUR OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT. PROJECTED CONTRIBUTION RATES -- FOR CAL STIRS IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR EMPLOYEES PRE PREPARA. TEN POINT 3% OF THAT WITH YOU WERE ASKING. ZERO YEAH I WAY WHEN HE SAID THAT IT'S EIGHTEEN I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET A PERMIT FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSONALIZING THE DIRECT COST OF THE EMPLOYEES IS OF THIS WHOLE THING IT'S UNCLEAR WHO PAYS WHEN THE DISTRICT HAS A HIGHER RATE THE MIGHT HEY IT BY NOT GETTING TEACHERS RAISES HI LYNN TEACHERS PAID BUT IT BUT IT IT. THEY COULD SPEND ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS YEP BUT EXPLAIN ALL HER THINGS OR THEY COULD JUST RAISE TAXES THE SYSTEM COULD GIVE IT ALL OF THE COUNTY OFFICES I MEAN YEAH I YEAH IT IS UNCLEAR ALL THE MONEY GOES RIGHT THAT'S THE PRICE I USUALLY POINT YEAH. THANK YOU -- OKAY SO YOU'RE KEY POINT IS THAT WERE WE HAVE A MUCH HIGHER LIABILITY. THAT'S TAKING UP MORE OF OUR EDUCATION FUNDING THAN IN THAT MOST STATES. YES BUT DIDN'T NEARLY TELL YOUR I. I DID JUMP TIME TOO SO IT'S GETTING WORSE EVERYWHERE SO THE NOT THE 10% FIGURE I GAVE FOR THE NATION WAS AS A TWENTY THIRTEEN THE NUMBER I GAVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S THE MOST RECENT OVER CALIFORNIA IS A HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER. COST THAT COST THEN THEN AVERAGE BUT NOT AS BIG AS THAT GAP IN PLACE IT IS A FOR THE SAME. GENERAL BENEFIT 2% PER YEAR OF SERVICES THAT THEY THAT WELL AS YESTERDAY BENEFITS CAN BE TRICKY TO PAY IT'S IT'S THE 22% IS ALSO WHEN YOU CAN COLLECT. AND AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS CALIFORNIA HAS A MORE GENEROUS THAN AVERAGE PENSION-PLAN. BUT THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE TEACHERS ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY. CALIFORNIA'S PLAN IS QUITE TYPICAL OF OF THE BENEFIT LEVEL OF PLANS AND OTHER STATES WHERE TEACHERS ARE NOT AND SOCIAL SECURITY RIGHT -- OKAY SO A NUMBER OF STATE TO PURSUE STRUCTURAL FORMS TO THEIR FUTURE PENSION PLANS RESPONSE TO RISING COSTS OF MY DAD. I REPORT GIVES MANY EXAMPLES OF THESE I'M NOT GONNA WIN THE DETAILS BUT THE COMMON THEME OF ALL SUCH REFORMS AS THAT THEY HAVE DE EMPHASIZE THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION STRUCTURE. WHICH IS MOST COMMON STRUCTURE PUBLIC CAN'T PLAY PENSION PLANS NATIONALLY IN THE STRUCTURE OF CASTERS. MOST A TO REFORM THEIR PLANS BY BLENDING DEFINED BENEFIT AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME STATES NOW OFFER HYBRID PLANS TO COMBINE BOTH TYPES. AND OTHERS GIVE TEACHERS A CHOICE BETWEEN PLANS DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS ON I CAN EXPLAIN HOW THIS TYPE OF PLAN WORKS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE IMPETUS FOR THE SHIP TO THAT THE STRUCTURE OF DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IS THAT THEY PREVENT DATA COOL. AS I'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT ACROSS TYPICAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AS THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. AND THEN FINALLY RESURGENT STATES HAVE ADOPTED HYBRID CHOICE PLANS FIND THAT THERE IS STRONG DEMAND AMONG TEACHERS FOR BOTH TYPES OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS STRUCTURES. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS THINK FICTIONAL. SO I'M PAUL WARNER I'M NEXT ARM THEM WITH PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION N.. YES THE FOR SOME HELP TO UNDERSTAND WHY SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS HAVE INCREASED -- SO QUICKLY. SO FIRST SOME BACKGROUND -- THE AB SIX OH TWO FORMULAS WHAT GUIDES -- STATE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL ED TO DISTRICTS. ARE ON AVERAGE. SB SIX OR TO PROVIDE ABOUT BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A STUDENT TO DISTRICTS. WHEN I SAY A STUDENT THAT'S BASED ON? THE ENTIRE DISTRICT EDA. SO IF JUST VERY ROUGHLY OF 10% OF STUDENTS ARE SPECIAL THEN. THEN FOR EACH SPECIAL ED STUDENT DISTRICTS GET ROUGHLY FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN STATE FUNDING EVERY YEAR -- SO. AND THEN EVERY YEAR THE STATE BUDGET UPDATES THOSE FIGURES FOR OF YOUR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AND FOR GOOD AND THE CHANGE IN A DA. I SHOULD NOTE. THIS FORMULA'S BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. AND WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE IN THE FORMULA IS CHANGES IN DISTRICT COST STRUCTURES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND THAT'S REALLY A LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN. DISTRICTS NOW THAT'S CAUSING FINANCIAL STRESS IN THAT PROGRAM M. WE'VE IDENTIFIED THREE REAL SPECIFIC FACTORS. FIRST HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE RATE OF STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH DISABILITIES. AND AND THE TYPE OF DISABILITIES -- IN OUR RODENT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT. ON SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE WE ESTIMATED THAT OVER TEN YEAR PERIOD ENDING IN. I THINK WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WENT UP ON THE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A LITTLE MORE -- JUST BECAUSE OF pEDUCATION STUDENTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE TYPE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THAT WERE BEING SERVED. AUTISM HAS. REALLY INCREASED A LOT IN OUR STATE AND AND THEIR THAT DISABILITIES EXPENSIVE ON AVERAGE -- TO TO ADDRESS AND SO THOSE TWO FACTORS. IS ONE BIG REASON WHY SPECIAL EDUCATION IS MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY. AGAIN THE FORMULA DIDN'T ADJUST TO THE CHANGES IN THE TYPE OF KIDS -- OR IN THE NUMBER OF OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. ALSO THE GROWTH IN THE PRESCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATION PRESCHOOLS IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. AND THE THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. UNDER AGE FIVE INCREASED -- ABOUT 10% DURING THAT PERIOD. WELL -- SINCE SINCE PRESCHOOL STUDENTS DON'T COUNT AS A AS A K. TWELVE STUDENT. OF THE FORMULA DID NOT ADJUST FOR THAT INCREASE SO THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR. THE THIRD FACTOR IS IS -- TO COMES OUT OF THE FACT THIS SPECIAL EDUCATION ELSE IF OF HAVE BEEN TREATED QUITE DIFFERENTLY SINCE THE CREATION OF BILLS HERE FOR A LOT OF NEW MONEY OR OR RESTORATION OF MONEY WAS PUT INTO ELSE IF OF OVERTIME. TO TO FULLY FUND THAT FORMULA AND SPECIAL EDUCATION DIDN'T GET COMMENSURATE INCREASES SO -- SERVER WAS DRIVING THE SALARY DISCUSSION IN MOST DISTRICTS -- AND SO. YOU KNOW -- TEACHERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES GOT THE THE THE INCREASES THAT THEY BARGAINED. FOR AND AND SPECIAL EDUCATION WAS OF COURSE INCLUDED IN THAT RIGHT BUT BY SPECIAL EDUCATION BUDGETS NO THE STATE FUNDING DIDN'T GO UP. COMMENSURATELY WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING YOU KNOW CFS SO DISTRICTS WERE FORCED TO SPEND MORE OF THEIR GENERAL PURPOSE MONEY RIGHT ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND TO PAY FOR THAT. SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE MAIN FACTORS THAT WE SEE OUT THERE -- YOU KNOW PUSHING A SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS HIGHER SO. WE PUT OUT A SECOND REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS PART OF GETTING DONE FAX. THAT RE EXAMINE SOME OF THESE COULD ISSUES AND WE CAME UP WITH A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT. FOR LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION IN HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH SPECIAL YOU KNOW WITH MAKING SPECIAL EDUCATION MORE RESPONSIVE OVER TIME AND WE THINK YOU COULD EITHER -- ONE INCREASED FUNDING FOR FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AT THE SAME RATE AS YOU DO FOR US IF I HAVE SO THAT THERE ISN'T THIS FUNNY DISEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS. THAT CAUSES DISTRICT STAFF TO SPEND MORE OUT OF THEIR OF SPECIAL I I'D OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS. OR YOU COULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE WANNA DO IS HAVE THE STATE SHARE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS BECAUSE TEN OVER TIME. AND YOU COULD DO THAT BY SAYING WELL WE'LL GO BACK TO THE MOST RECENT YEAR WE HAVE ACCOUNTING DATA ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT. WAS PENT ON SPECIAL LED BY DISTRICTS AN INCREASE THE STATE'S SHARE OF ACCORDINGLY AT AS IN FUTURE BUDGETS SO. WE RECOMMEND CAUTION ABOUT GOING OF BASING FUNDING ON THE COUNT OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS. WE LOOKED AT THE INCIDENCE OF SPECIALIZED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CUT OF THE STATE AND THEIR SURPRISING VARIATION IN THE PERCENT OF KIDS WHO ARE IN SPECIAL ED. WEFOUND ONE COUNTY THAT ISSUE IS JUST ABOUT A 9% OF KIDS IN SPECIAL ED. AND ANOTHER COUNTY THE HEAD OVER EDUCATION IS THAT THE ISSUE OF EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING THAT WE HEAR ABOUT HERE NO. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT MAYBE TOUCH OR ARE YOU ABLE TO TOUCH ON THAT AT SOME POINT SURE THAT WAS IN. A REPORT -- THERE'S A A LARGE -- THIS IS JUST A HISTORICAL KIND OF FACTOR THAT IS TYPICAL IN STATE. YOU KNOW FINDING PROGRAMS WHERE -- SOME CHANGES WERE MADE AND IT THIS EQUALIZED -- THE WHAT DISTRICTS GET IN IN TERMS OF STATE FUNDING WE DID SPEND. QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TRYING. TO DO SOME OF THAT EQUALIZATION pHIT -- THOSE KIND EFFORTS HAD TO STOP. IN THERE ARE PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCES IN IN DISTRICT FUNDING -- WE HAD RECOMMENDED -- IN ONE OF OUR REPORTS THAT. YOU COULD EQUALIZE UP TO I THINK IS THE 95% -- YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE ALMOST ALL DISTRICTS. BE FUNDED AT THE SAME LEVEL -- BUT IT TAKES -- IT TAKES SOME REAL MONIES -- ONE STATES IN THE SEVERAL HUNDRED MLLION DOLLAR RANGE AND I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TO THE THE CAUSE OF THE EQUALIZATION ISSUE IS AT THE POPULATION SHIFT STUDENT POPULATION SHIFT INCREASES IN SCHOOL POPULATION -- ITS IT'S IT'S MORE -- WHO IS IN CONTROL AT THE TIME? WELL SO. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IN THE TWO THOUSANDS THE -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION TO TRY TO LIVE UP CERTAIN PERCENT OF COSTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OUR MODEL BACK THEN WAS A BLENDED MODEL OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE SPENDING AND WE PROVIDED WE GUARANTEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR DISTRICTS. SO THAT MEANT THAT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS TAKING SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS. IT WAS THAT WAS GOING UP FAST AND WE'RE BACKING OUT STAE FUND. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE UNDERSTANDABLY WASN'T VERY HAPPY AT THAT AND SO THEY PASSED A LAW SAYING YOU COULDN'T DO THAT. SO WE HAD TO REALLY. SEPARATE THE TWO SYSTEMS AND WHEN WE DID THAT THEN YOU KNOW THE STATE FUNDING WHICH HAD BEEN JUST REALLY -- YOU KNOW BASED IN PART ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THERE'S JUST ALL NO LOGIC TO THE STATE LEVELS ANYMORE RIGHT. BECAUSE WE THE THE TWO PIECES WERE WERE VERY CONSISTENT WENT YOU ADDED THEM TOGETHER BUT THE FEDERAL MOUNTS WITH COULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT IS BASED ON A DIFFERENT FORMULA AND THEN STATE FORMULA. SO IT'S JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THIS FUNNY TENSION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO THERE WAS SOME SCHOOLS FOR I GUESS THAT WOULD GET. THE FULL STATE MONEY AND THEN THE FEDERAL MONEY ON TOP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OFFSET [inaudible] AND HENCE. UNEQUAL FUNDING AROUND THE STATE THAT'S RIGHT YES. THE BALANCING WENT AWAY YES YES THAT'S RIGHT. MY SIMPLISTIC WAY OF THANK YOU FOR TOUCHING ON THE SHIP. SO THAT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW WHAT I CAME SAID TODAY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PERFECT -- ONLY QUESTIONS OR WAY OUR SURE. THANKS YES UP AUBURN A UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS. IN DISTRICTS -- ALSO REPORT AS PART OF THE GETTING DOWN TO FAX PROJECT I'VE TRIED UPDATE THAT A LITTLE BIT WITH SOME OF THE MORE RECENT DATA FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SCHOOL YEAR -- AS HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE ALREADY TODAY MOST DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA OFFER REALLY TWO TYPES OF HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS THERE'S THOSE BENEFITS FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES MEDICAL AND DENTAL AND THEN THERE'S THE CONTINUING BENEFITS. VOTERS ENTITLED -- PADS FOR THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES WHO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS AND THE CONCERN FOR A LOT OF DISTRICTS IS THAT. THE COST OF THESE BENEFITS OF INCREASED AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN THEIR REVENUES EXPENDITURES AS A WHOLE SO FROM SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF LIKE TOTAL PER PUPIL SPENDING IN THE STATE IS UP BY ABOUT 18%. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION BUT IT'S UP ABOUT 39% ON HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES ABOUT 85% FOR THESE -- PERHAPS ON A PER PUPIL BASIS SO INCREASING TWO TO FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN SPENDING AS A WHOLE IS UP BY 85% YES RIGHT NOW OPENS AS OUR SMALL PART OF DISTRICT BUDGETS BUT THEY'RE INCREASING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE -- THAN -- THAN A TEN SPENDING AS A WHOLE AND SUPPORT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THESE SPENDING ON THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE IT IS A LARGER PART OF DISTRICT BUDGETS NOW THAN IT USED TO BE SO NOW DISTRICTS OF ALL OF ALL SPENDING ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT IS ON THE HEALTH. AND WELFARE BENEFITS FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES THAT'S UP FROM ABOUT 7% FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND THIS IS REALLY FOR TWO MAIN REASONS ONE IS THAT DISTRICTS IN PLACE SLIGHTLY MORE STAFF PER STUDENT THAN THEY USED TO SO THAT INCREASES BENEFIT COST TO SOME EXTENT. A SOMEWHAT LARGER ISSUE IS THAT THE PER STAFF COST OF THESE BENEFITS AS INCREASED. MORE RAPIDLY AS IT HAS FOR MANY TYPES OF AMERICAN WORKERS OF JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE AVERAGE COST OF HEALTH BENEFITS PER TEACHER IS ABOUT 34% HIGHER NOW THAN IT WAS AND IN. TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN PAYING A LARGER SHARE. OF THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST THEY OFTEN PLANT PAY ALMOST ALL OF THE BENEFIT COST FOR THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION -- WHICH MEANS THAT THE DISTRICT IS OFTEN SHOULDERING THE FULL COST OF THIS THIS THIS AND THIS COST GROWTH -- THAT'S CONFERS CONCERNING FOR SOME OF THE OBVIOUS REASONS FOR DISTRICTS IT PREVENTS THEM FROM INVESTING IN SOME OTHER OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE SERVICES FRIEND DUPLICATED PEOPLE'S UNDER LC FF FOR NAVIGATING THESE THESE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS OF TEACHER SALARY INCREASES AND ADDITIONAL CONCERN IS THAT THESE KINDS OF COSTS FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE. BENEFITS WILL TEND TO INCREASE -- EVEN IF DISTRICT REVENUES DON'T SO WE'VE ANNA SO I THINK IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN A GROWTH AND REVENUE AND DISTRICTS THIS IS MAYBE STEPS GEARED SOMEWHAT SOME OF THIS COST GROWTH IN HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT DISTRICT REVENUES WILL CONTINUE GROWING IN THE FUTURE. PARTICULARLY IF THE STATE ECONOMY DETERIORATES TO SOME EXTENT THESE THESE KINDS OF COSTS WILL TEND TO GROW ANYWAY. AND THEN AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THERE THESE RETIREE BENEFITS THESE -- PADS THEY REPRESENT SORT OF A SEPARATE CHALLENGE FOR DISTRICTS -- AS I THINK WAS MENTIONED I THINK THE STATEWIDE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES FOR THESE BENEFITS HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN PROMISED TO RETIREES IS IN THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR RANGE. THAT'S PARTICULARLY AN ISSUE FOR A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF DISTRICTS MAYBE TEN TO FIFTEEN DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE VERY LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PEOPLE. AND THOUGH THIS DOES DISTRICTS THAT TEND THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT TEND TO HAVE. MUCH MORE GENEROUS SO BAD. I YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND AND TO HAVE NOT -- PRE FUNDED THEM SAYS ME AS AND TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. OKAY SO S. AS IN THE MIX IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED IS THAT A BY LAW DISTRICTS ARE NEGOTIATING THESE BENEFITS PACKAGES WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES BOTH ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND FOR THEIR RETIREES SO THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION SO IT'S HARD TO TALK IN VERY GENERAL TERMS ABOUT SORT OF WHAT. THE CHALLENGES FOR DISTRICTS ARE WHAT THE PATH FORWARD MIGHT BE BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE IS THAT -- DISTRICTS ONE OF THE WAYS FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICTS CAN SAVE ON THEIR BENEFIT COSTS FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES IS BY -- FOUR ONE REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO PLAY LOWER PAY A LARGER SHARE OF AND THESE BENEFIT PLANS WHILE THEY'RE WORKING SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SEE THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE FROM OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE THAT. WHEN TEACHERS ARE PAYING A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR BENEFIT COSTS? THE DISTRICTS SAVE MONEY NOT JUST BECAUSE THE THE TEACHERS ARE PAYING SOME OF THOSE COSTS DIRECTLY BUT BECAUSE THE TEACHERS ARE OPTING TO BUY SO MUCH CHEAPER PLANS -- FOR EXAMPLE WHICH MEANS THE MIGHT BE BOTH SAVE MONEY FOR DISTRICTS AND POTENTIALLY BE MORE EFFICIENT UNDER THAT DEPENDS A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT DISTRICTS DO WITH SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY THEY SAVE -- THERE'S ALSO YOU SEE SOME EVIDENCE THAT DISTRICTS ARE DOING SOME OF THAT SORT OF PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT THEY OFFER. IN TERMS OF THEIR BENEFITS PACKAGES THIS ALSO APPEARS TO BE TRUE TO SOME EXTENT OF THESE -- PET PACKAGES THAT THEY OFFER SO SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHICH IS AS FAR BACK AS I CAN GO YOU DO SEE FEWER DISTRICTS TODAY THEY'RE OFFERING THESE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR LIFE. OR TO RETIREES OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE OR EVEN TO RETIREES AT ALL AND THE PROGRAMS THEY DO OFFER THESE BENEFITS OFFER THEM -- FOR THEY TEND TO EXPIRE AT SLIGHTLY YOUNGER AGES ARE AFTER A SMALLER NUMBER OF YEARS WHETHER AT LEAST PHASING THESE REQUIREMENTS IN FOR NEW TEACHERS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN MAKE NAVIGATING THESE. LARGE LIABILITIES DIFFICULT IS THAT THEY'VE OFTEN BEEN ACCUMULATED OVER MANY MANY YEARS AND IT'S DIFFICULT NOW TO COME IN AND CHANGE CHANGE THE BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT YOU'RE THE OFFERING TO TEACHERS THAT YOU PROMISED THEM MAYBE THIRTY YEARS AGO. AS THEY STARTED WORKING LIKE STEP THAT. MEAN I CAN SEE HOW. NO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES NEED HEALTH INSURANCE IN THIS PROBLEM WITH RAPIDLY ESCALATING PREMIUMS. FOR FOR HEALTH INSURANCE IS A PROBLEM THAT ALL EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES SHARE AND AND IT'S JUST ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. ON SORT OF A LARGE SCALE NOT JUST INSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I THINK IT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POST EMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR ANOTHER. HEALTH PLAN PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH PLAN -- FOR WHICH A DISTRICT PROVIDED A PLAN COULD BE A SUPPLEMENT WHERE THE PREMIUM IS DRAMATICALLY LOWER BECAUSE OF THE OF THE INSTANCE OF USING UTILIZATION OF THE SUPPLEMENT SO. I MEAN THERE REALLY. TO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ISSUES ARE THERE YES EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THAT ACTIVE EMPLOYEES KNOW TYRESE ARE SEPARATE ISSUES I THINK EVEN WITH ENDING ABOUT THESE RETIREE BENEFITS THEY'RE SORT OF TWO DISTINCT ISSUES OF SORT OF MANY DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY ACCUMULATED THESE LARGE UNFUNDED LIBRARIES AND MAYBE RENEGOTIATING AS BENEFIT PACKAGES. GOING FORWARD IS NOT NECESSARILY. GOING TO HELP WITH THOSE LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND FOR EXAMPLE IS ALSO THINGS THAT DISTRICTS CAN BE DOING GOING FORWARD THINGS LIKE DOING ADDITIONAL PRE FUNDING SO DISTRICTS IN MANY CASES. ARE NOT DO NOT SET ASIDE MONEY FOR THEIR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES TO PAY FOR THEIR RETIREE BENEFITS LATER YOU DO SEE A GROW DISTRICTS DURING THIS INCREASINGLY PRE FUNDING THESE BENEFITS. THAT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF A OF AVOIDING THESE LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES ACCUMULATING IT ALSO SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IF YOU SET ASIDE THE MONEY IN A TRUST AS YOUR OFTEN A COUPLE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER SOME NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- YOU CAN ACCUMULATE INTEREST ON THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU CAN THEN USE TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE BENEFITS LATER SO BUT AGAIN THAT'S AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE PROMISED A LOT OF BENEFITS ALREADY THAT. THAT MIGHT NOT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY. FOR THE ON THE OTHER LASTING I'D SAY FROM SORT OF A A STATE PERSPECTIVE AGAIN IT IS A FUNDING STATUS THINKING ABOUT ENGAGING WITH AT THE STATE LEVEL IS THERE SOME THINGS THAT STATE DO TO ADJUST -- FUNDING FORMULAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT -- WITH SOURCE ENTITLED GEOGRAPHIC COST TO JUST MONTH ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT -- A WORKERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS -- OFTEN TO SORT OF COMMAND HIGHER SALARIES ARE HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPENSATION THIS MIGHT BE PARTICULAR TO IN A PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S JUST A TREMENDOUS VARIATION FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN TERMS OF SORT OF WHAT A COLLEGE GRADUATE LIKE A TEACHER MIGHT EXPECT TO EARN IN THE JOB. FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLELIKE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF WORKER AND ONE PART OF THE STATE AND ANOTHER IN SOME STATES TO MAKE THESE SORTS OF COST ADJUSTMENTS. OF MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WE SEE WITH THE HIGHEST HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFIT COSTS OR THE LARGEST -- PEBBLE LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN IN JEEP PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE -- COLLEGE GRADUATES EARN HIGHER WAGES ON AVERAGE -- AND SO THOSE KINDS OF ADJUSTMENTS BUT TEND TO BENEFIT THESE DISTRICTS ON AVERAGE. AND GO BUT IT JUST IN THE FUNDING FORMULA FROM THE STATE TO THE DISTRICT YEAH SO IT THERE'D AND THE YEAH SO THERE'S A THE THE STATE FUNDING FORMULA TO SOME TYPE OF ADJUSTMENTS ALREADY FOR THINGS LIKE SMALL DISTRICTS AND MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME SOMETHING YOU DO SEE. SOME STATES LOOKING INTO AND STARTING TO TO IMPLEMENTED ALSO GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN THIS SORT OF THINKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT KINDS OF COSTS ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE FACTORING THAT IN -- IF IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS ALSO JUST NEED TO BE OFFERING MORE GENEROUS BENEFITS ANYWAY JUST BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT THE STATE WHICH IS AN EASIER DECISION TO MAKE IF THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUCKET. OVERALL [inaudible] OTHERWISE WE'RE YEAH. SO I WITH THAT THAT'S ALSO RECOMMEND IT'LL COME IS THERE BUT AGAIN LIKE EVERYONE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ARE LOWER LOOK AND OTHER ISSUES IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK OF AS MIND IT'S THEIR OWN YOU ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH -- WELL JUST SO YOU AND YOUR FIRST YOUR FIRST COMMENT ABOUT HOW ON THE COSTS ARE GROWING AT A FASTER CLIP IS THAT IS THAT PARTLY BECAUSE OF JUST THE GENERAL PHENOMENON OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. YES I'M SAY SO CLARIFY I THOUGHT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THEY JUST TEND TO GROW THE COST OF HEALTHCARE TEND TO GROW FASTER THAN THE THAT JUST SORT OF COST IN GENERAL AND THIS IS JUST AN ACROSS THE BOARD PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. YES IT TOO AT THE IT'S A NICE NOT LIMITED EDUCATION A CALIFORNIA BY APPOINTMENT. OKAY AND ARE YOU SEEING A AND WHAT WHAT ARE SOME. CAN YOU GET I GUESS FLUSH OUT ALL THAT MORE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES YOU'RE SEEING OUT THERE -- IN TERMS OF AND AND I I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON STATES THAT REALLY DO -- YOU KNOW. HAVE. GOOD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR WITH THEIR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT DID THAT. YOU HAVE PROBABLY VALUE THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES -- BUT ARE DOING SO IN A WAY THAT IS -- IN pA FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS A CALIFORNIA CAN LEARN GIVEN -- IN OUR VALUES IS STATE. I YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T WE WE WE DON'T WANT TO TURN WE WANT TO BE DRAWN FROM AND SOME STATES THAT HAVE REALLY GONE OFF THE DEEP IN TERMS OF UNDER INVESTING IN -- EDUCATION THERE AND A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BUT BUT THAT BUT BUT THAT THAT ARE FINDING WAYS TO MAKE -- THEIR SYSTEM OR THE MORE. FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE. WAS IT FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF YOU ACTUALLY IMAGES THIS BILL ON THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH THAN THE GENERATION FIX THAT AND AND AND ON THE ISSUES THAT YOU ALL WERE WORKING ON YES I'M OUTSIDE SO TO SAY SOMETHING I TOUCHED ON BRIEFLY ON THE HEALTH. BENEFITS SIDE IS SOMETHING THAT. AS I SAID I THINK SOME STATES HAVE SEEN IS THAT -- IF -- IF WHEN IF TEACHERS OR MAKE LARGER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR BENEFIT PLANS THAT BOTH SIDES DISTRICT MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE THE AND THE THE TEACHERS ARE PAYING SOME OF THE BENEFIT COSTS AND IT ALSO. MEANS THAT THEY TEND OP FOR CHEAPER PLANS SO ONE OF THE UPSHOT OF THAT IS IT CAN HELP THE DISTRICT NAVIGATE THESE BECAUSE IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY. FOR IT MIGHT BE FOR MANY TEACHERS ALSO MORE ATTRACTIVE IN SOME CASES BECAUSE IT DEPENDING ON IF DISTRICTS TAKE THEIR SAVINGS AND GIVE IT TO TEACHERS BACK IN THE FORM OF SALARY FOR EXAMPLE TEACHERS MY STILL AT THE OPTION IF THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR THEIR SALARY COMPENSATION -- AND THEN AND THEN YOU MORE FLEXIBILITY AND USE IT TO BUY THE SAME BENEFIT PACKAGE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE SO INCLINED OR NOT. I AM A WHY THERE'S SO MUCH RELUCTANCE TO THAT SORT OF THING WAIT WITH IT. ON THE OTHER SIDE AMERICAN I CAN ANSWER SORT OF HERE SORT OF IN A GENERAL WAY I THINK IT VARIES A LOT DEPENDING ON PROJECT IN A PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH SO MANY DISTRICT WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT NEEDS I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF DISTRICTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. HAVING DIFFERENT NEEDS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY NEED TO COMPENSATE EMPLOYEES OR THE KINDS OF PACKAGES THAT HAVE BEEN INHERITED OVER TIME BUT I CAN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY TO SORT OF WHY INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS IN MAKING THAT THE CHOICES THAT THEY MAKE ON OKAY HAVE YOU SEEN ANY DISTRICT ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE THAT WE HAD EARLIER WITH MR FIND OF YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW DISTRICTS ARE. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FOUND A WAY -- TO YOU KNOW TO TO TRANSITION -- THERE HAVE LIABILITIES. TO BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXISTING. INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE WHETHER BE MEDICARE COVER CALIFORNIA ACA AT BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT REALLY -- YOU KNOW BECAME A IN WIN FOR THEIR BOTH THEIR RETIREES AND THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYEES WHO COULD THEN REAP THE WINDFALL OF THE SAVE MY NEED. THAT MONEY COULD BE ROLLED INTO. CLASS SIZE REDUCTIONS AND SALARY INCREASES AT OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES OUT THERE OF FOLKS WHO FOUND A WAY. TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN IN A WAY THAT COULD BE A WIN WIN FOR THE DISTRICT. HI COULD SOMEONE COULD GIVE ME MORE VERSUS THE WIRING TO SEEMS TO ME TO BE -- I'LL TAKE A STEP SO I I THINK THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACE SO IN THE PENSIONS SPACE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE DONE THINGS TO REDUCE THEIR PENSION COSTS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT SOME OF THAT SAVINGS IS GONNA HIGHER TEACHER SALARIES BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT NUMBER. THE BUDGETS ARE VERY COMPLICATED SAID A PENSION COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN AND MAYBE SALARIES HAVE GOTTEN BETTER BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT SALARIES WOULD HAVE BEEN. IF THEY DIDN'T LOWER THEIR PENSION COSTS. AND SO YOU KNOW NO ONE SITTING ON THE BUDGET SAY OKAY HERE'S THE PENSION SAVINGS WHEN I PUT IT RIGHT INTO SALARIES. YOU KNOW IN MARKING OUT AND READ FOR US TO SEE ON THE BUDGET SO. I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO TRACE WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING BACK I I WILL SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE I GET UP A COULD NOT BE PART OF A OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WHERE IT WHERE. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIRECT NEXUS YOU KNOW THAT THE OKAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE THESE CHANGES HERE AND THEN HERE'S WHAT THE DISTRICT'S GONNA DO. ON THIS END AND THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE TO ME BUT I HAVE NO EXPERTISE TO SAY WHY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN MORE BUT CLEARLY SOMETHING THERE SOMETHING INHIBITING THAT RIGHT BUT IT SEEMS SENSIBLE TO ME WHAT YOU JUST SAID. WE KNOW WE WE COULD SOMEBODY COULD CALCULATE THAT JUST IF I COULD JUMP AND SOMEBODY COULD CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE IN. IN TOTAL COST FOR A POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF FOR SOMEONE WHO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. FOR HEALTH PREMIUM VERSUS MEDICARE AND THE COST OF A SUPPLEMENT AND YOU COULD COME UP YOU WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE SO EXACT SCIENCE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE DELTA IS. AND PRESUMABLY THE DELTA IS GOING TO GO TO SOMETHING. IT'S EITHER GOING TO GO CORRECTION SALARIES AND BENEFITS WHO ARE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES OR IT'S GOING TO GO TO SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT. BUT I GUESS NOBODY'S DONE THAT SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT COULD ALL BE DONE AS PART OF A YOU KNOW BUT PARTY PROCESS FOR YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOU JUST CAME UP I THINK WAS SACRAMENTO SAID YOU GUYS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE TO DO THIS REDUCTION IN. COSTS BUT THEY ENDED THE TEACHERS UNION WANTS THE MONEY TO GO TO CERTAIN THINGS IN THE DISTRICTS AS WE JUST NEED THE MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE KIND OF SCENARIO THAT PLAYED OUT WITH. THAT. I SESSION SPECULATE TOO MUCH RIGHT MANAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TO THE DESTROYED A LOCAL DISTRICT THAT HAS ONE OF THESE POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IF. IF THEY SUFFERED SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE CALCULATOR RUN THE NUMBER. AND SAY HERE'S WHAT THE DELTA IS AND THEN PUT THE MONEY ON THE TABLE HAVE A CONTRACT NEGOTIATION AND EITHER THEY HAVE IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR NOBODY'S BOTHERED SO. I THINK THE RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING MY HOPE POINT IS THAT YOU THE CLIP YOU THE THE BARGAINING UNIT WOULD ONLY PERSONALLY FIND AS ATTRACTIVE AS AN OPTION IF A WE WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT GUARANTEEING. YOU KNOW OF OF OF OF OF SUBSTANTIVELY -- YOU KNOW EQUAL LEVEL SERVICE FOR THE RETIREES PLUS. OF A YOU KNOW A DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN THOSE COST SAVINGS AND SUPPORT FOR THE EMPLOYEES THROUGH. YOU KNOW HIRING MORE FOLKS AND PEOPLE BETTER. SO BUT BUT THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD WILL FIND OME COMMON GROUND ON GIVEN I MEAN THAT WAS THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT I'VE BEEN SEEING WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE STRIKES PEOPLE BEING UPSET ABOUT. THE LACK OF ADEQUATE NURSES IN LIBRARIANS IN CLASS SIZE IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF AND THAT'S HOW YOU FIND MORE MONEY AND YOU DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T YOU KNOW. ATRAER RETIREES. I MEAN YOU GUYS ARE ALL KIND OF NODDING TO ME BUT I BUT I GUESS THE GIVEN HOW HOW HOT THIS IS GETTING WHY WHY AREN'T WE WHAT WHY IS IN THIS BEING MORE WHY IN THIS OF OF A MORE. INTENSE CONVERSATION GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LIKE WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S STANDING IN THE WAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP PUSHED ALONG. SO MY MY NOT IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR THERE'S ACTUALLY GOOD EVIDENCE IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE THAT THE TEACHERS DON'T VALUE THE COST OF THEIR PENSIONS. AT THE FULL COST AT AT WHAT IT COSTS THAT TIPPER TO PROVIDE THEM IN TERMS OF THEY'D RATHER HAVE MORE RESOURCES SHIFTED THE CURRENT SALARIES AND SO. AND AND I'M GONNA DETAILS WHETHER I I THINK THERE'S SOME COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S TRUE SO THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION MUST BE A POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS AND AND AND WERE OUT OF MY AREA OF EXPERTISE FINAL TO TELL YOU BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE ON THE TABLE SUGGEST THAT A DEAL. LIKE THAT. EVERYONE SHOULD BE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT SO THERE SOME ASPECT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT'S THAT'S INHIBITING THINGS IS IS MY ONLY RESPONSE. CAN YOU SPECULATE IT FURTHER I MEAN YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT POLITICIZE THIS BUT LIKE. WHAT'S GOING BUT WHEN MY MISSING HERE WITH WHAT YOU KNOW AND ESPECIALLY ON THINK THIS THAT YOU JUST RAISED. IF THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES WOULD RATHER. HAVE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THE I'M NOT AYE THIS IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A GENERALITY I MEAN YEAH -- I CAN SEE THAT THAT -- NEWER TEACHERS FOR FOR LIQUIDITY. AND AND WOULD LIKE MORE OF THEIR COMPENSATION PACKAGE LOWER THAN THE SALARY. NINE AS YOU GET OLDER AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A FAMILY I MEAN I I GUESS IS VARIATION THERE BUT COR YOU KNOW THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO THE STUDY I'M REFERRING TO ACTUALLY LOOKS OLDER TEACHERS AND SO OFTEN IS AS EVEN THE MORE TRUE FOR YOUNGER TEACHERS -- YEAH OKAY INTERESTING OKAY THE PENSIONS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AT SURELY THE VALUE THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN HAVE RETIREMENT ABSOLUTE THAT'S AB. SO IT THAT IS SO THAT THE STUDY I'M THINKING OF IS IN ILLINOIS AND THERE'S A REALLY GENEROUS PENSIONS FOR THE TEACHERS THERE AND YOU GET A TON OF MONEY RETIREMENT AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUY BACK TO BUY MUCH BETTER PENSIONS. BUT THE PRICING CURRENT SALARY TEACHERS WILLING TO PAY WAS FAR LESS THAN WHAT IT COST TO PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS. BUT IS THAT MAYBE THAT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE COSTS ARE AS THEIR THEIR EVENT HORIZONS ARE NOT THAT FAR SO AS YOU WE WANT LIQUIDITY NOW RATHER THAN LATER YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT WRAPS IT SO THE WAY THAT THE PERSON TO THAT'S THEY DESCRIBE IT IS THAT -- ARGUMENT WAS THAT TEACHERS IN PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEE PLAYS WERE GENERALLY ARE ARE OVER SATURATED WITH PENSION WELL. SO ON THE MARGIN SO THEY DON'T VALUE THEIR POTENTIAL THEIR PENSIONS ARE JUST SO GENEROUS. THE RALLY RELATIVE TO THE RETIREMENT OF A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ON THE MARGIN NEED RATHER PULL SOME OF THAT MONEY FORWARD IF THEY CRIED AND THERE AND THEY GOT ABOUT HER ARE YOU AND I'M NOT. GETTING RELATIVELY LOWER PAY THAN OTHER PROFESSIONALS AT RIGHT HANDED RATHER RE BALANCE OUT A LITTLE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I MAKES US [inaudible] YEAH. I'M OKAY WELL I YOU KNOW ANY OTHER KIND OF COMMENTS ON THE INTERCHANGEABLE AND ABOUT THIS OR NOT REALLY I MEAN I'M ALSO A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO -- SO WE WE ACTUALLY ARE -- HEADS ARE NOT BIG AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY RUNNING ON RAZOR THIN MARGIN HERE BUT WE HAVE A CONSULTANT COME IN WITH -- SO WE'RE GOING FOR NEGOTIATIONS SO WE HAD A A A CLOSED SESSION AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONSULTANT COME IN WITH A AN EXCEL SIMULATOR AND WE HAD TO MAKE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT CHOICES -- TO TO DEVELOP WHAT OUR SIDE OF THE OFFERS GOING TO BE -- SO IT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT WE WE OF HAS RUN CLEAR THERE BECAUSE DR. OKAY AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT I'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY ME PRIVATELY WITH MISTER WARREN I I VERY MUCH RESPECT AND APPRECIATE YOUR RESEARCH WE'RE DOING SOME WORK IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW BUT THE ISSUE OF A SPECIAL ED FINANCES BECAUSE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER YOU KNOW. IT'S BECOME AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ANOTHER REAL GROWING COST PRESSURE. AND THAT IS CONTINUE TO GROW AT A AT A RATE. MIRRORS THE THE THAT THAT KIND OF IT THE BENEFITS LIABILITIES THAT EVERYONE'S TAKEN ON AND AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH FEDERAL LAW AND AND THE FACT THE PHONE GOVERNMENT'S REFUSED TO FIND -- ID A EVEN A CLOSE TO WHAT THEY PROMISED INITIALLY LET ALONE THE FULL COST -- BUT YOU KNOW AND WATCH THIS SPACE BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT I'M THE RESPECT OF TIME ON MIGHT IT MIGHT I JUST ADD IN ADDITION TO THE THE THE UNDERFUNDING OF IDA THEIR THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MADE ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. THAT THEY THE SPENDING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION THE STICK. RIGHT RIGHT SO SO -- I MEAN THERE'S GOOD REASONS FOR FOR A LOT OF THIS AS WELL BUT DON'T WANT TO ALLOW. DESTRUCTIVE JUST DROP. DROP FUNDING FOR NO REASON. BUT BUT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT I THINK WE JUST WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT BETTER REFLECTS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED. IT WILL HAVE A WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL HAVE ANOTHER HEARING THAT -- AT LEAST IN PART FOCUSES ON SPECIAL INTEGRATION AND I'LL INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO PLEASE. THAT THAT SURVEYS. YEAH I WANNA BRING THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HONORING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE ISSUE OF PENSIONS -- AND OBVIOUSLY IN STATE GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM -- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE SCHOOLS. SO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A INNOVATIVE WAY OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH IT. THEY HAVE CREATED AND AN OPTIONAL MATTER REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL FOR A ONE K.. FOR NEW EMPLOYEES -- THAT THAT. THE SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS OF IN NATURE THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE JOBS IN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS YOU'D BE BETTER OFF. IN GETTING THAT MONEY BACK. SOME SORT OF A MATCH -- AND BE ABLE TO INVESTED ON YOUR OWN -- ADDED AND THAT WOULD BE BETTER OFF FOR THE EMPLOYEES SO YOU WERE TO CALIFORNIA OFFERED THIS I GUESS THREE YEARS AGO. AND THAT THE INFORMATION I GET IS THAT 40%. OF ABOUT 40% OF THE NEW EMPLOYEES ARE PICKING. THAT FOUR OH ONE K. OPTION. FOUR THAT'S A LOT NOW. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME LIMITATIONS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SAME OPTION. FOR NEW EMPLOYEES AND MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. YEAH SURE SO I WILL ALSO SAY SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES OF K. TWELVE TEACHERS THAT MERE THAT SAME RESULTS OF FLORIDA COME TO TOP MY MIND THEY HAVE A CHOICE TEACHERS CAN CHOOSE WHICH PLAN A ONE I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT. FIFTY FIFTY WOULD CHOOSE THE FOUR OH ONE K. TYPE PLAN VERSUS DEFINED BENEFIT -- SO I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND THE WORKFORCE IS DIVERSE YOUR POINT ABOUT YOUNG WORKERS I THINK IT'S QUITE WELL ESTABLISHED IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY IN IN THESE POSITIONS FOR A FULL CAREER YOU'RE BETTER OFF GETTING A FOUR ONE K. TYPE PLANTS. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN'T. THERE'S NO THESE IT'S A STATE LAW DAY STATE POLICY TO EL ALL THE TEACHERS HAVE TO BE ENROLLED IN CAL STIRS. SO THERE HAVE TO BE A CHANGE TO STATE LAWS MY UNDERSTANDING IN ORDER TO ALLOW MAKE THIS POSSIBLE BUT THE NUMBER OF STATES HAVE DONE THIS. THE SOMEONE SUGGEST THAT -- IF THAT LAW WERE TO BE ENACTED. THAT YOU WOULD JEOPARDIZE CHARACTERS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT BE GETTING THOSE WE WERE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE SYSTEM WOULD THAT BE YOUR ANALYSIS. I THINK I THINK THAT'S A FALSE ARGUMENT -- BECAUSE THE PLAN THE SYSTEM IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED TO HAVE THAT THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE COURT FUNDED EVERY FOR EVERY YEAR IBM THE FULL BENEFITS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAID BY THEMSELVES IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PAY GO SYSTEM. ANOTHER WAY TO STATUS IS THERE'S AT THAT POINT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA'S SORT OF YOU CAN IMAGINE ANALOGY TO DIG A HOLE. AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO START DIGGING THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS KEEP DIGGING IS NOT REALLY COMPELLING ARGUMENT EVER GET OUT OF THE HOLE. I'M YOU HAVE A CERTAIN DAY EVEN ACCUMULATED THAT ALREADY HAPPENED YESTERDAY IS GONE AND AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE REGARDLESS WHAT POLICY FROM TOMORROW. THE BECAUSE OF YOU ACTUALLY AGREED WITH THAT ARGUMENT THAT SOMEHOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD BE AFFECTED. IN ESSENCE YOU BE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU'RE ENGAGED IN A PONZI SCHEME. THAT THE SOLVENCY IS ONLY OCCURRING BECAUSE OF GETTING MORE SUCKERS TO COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM TO PAY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THAT YOU'VE ALREADY COMMITTED. TO YOU SAID IT YEAH SELF. I MEAN I I FIND THE THING SO INTERESTING BECAUSE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE UP WITH EVIDENCE IN AND OUR STATE AND IN OTHERS THAT THE EMPLOYEES BENEFIT THEY IT'S A DESIRABLE OPTION FOR THEM. AND AND AT SO THEY WOULD THEY WOULD LIKE IT IT'S IT'S A CHOICE AND FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT STOPS THAT WHOLE FROM GETTING ANY DEEPER. RIGHT AND ADDS AN OVERTIME WILL DETACH AS FROM THIS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WERE AND AGAIN OVER TIME -- AND YET THERE IS RESISTANCE. BECAUSE OF THIS FALSE CLAIM IS YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOMEHOW THE EXISTING RETIREMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY. OF TAKING THAT STEP AND YET WE PREVENT ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM HAVING THAT CHOICE THAT CHOICE TO HAVE AN OPTION. IS NOT EVEN GIVEN TO THEM TODAY. I FIND IT -- YEAH WITH ITS PART NOW THEY THEY IF IT DID THEY CANNOT BARGAIN THIS OPTION IS THAT CORRECT. THEY COULD ADD MAYBE PROBABLY ADDED ONE ON THEMSELVES BUT THEY COULD NOT GIVE A CHOICE YOU HAVE TO BE AND CAL STAR IS IF YOU'RE A CERTIFIED. SOMETHING. AT SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- THE THAT IN SAY BY THE WAY. WE HEARD ABOUT THE LA EXAMPLE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HEARD THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS. HAVE GIVEN THE CONTROL -- OVER OTHER BENEFITS PROGRAM TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE. THAT SEEMS TO BE DOMINATED NOT BY THE ADMINISTRATION BUT BY THE PLOY GROUPS HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT EXAMPLE IN PLACE ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MUST BE HEALTH NOT PENSIONS RIGHT. HEALTH YES SO -- YEAH I I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE HEALTH STUFF YOU HAVE A COULD I KNOW CAN BE WITH PENSIONS BECAUSE PENSION YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. YES SIR -- I JUST -- I'M I'M I'M TRULY CAN TREE BY THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF PRE FUNDING WHAT WHAT TIME BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE ANSWER RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW. CERTAINLY MOVING FOR I MEAN HERE I AM ON THE CHAIR THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE PART WHAT WE DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING -- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP IT AT LEAST NOT AS SOME OF IT AND YET WE GOT TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE CAN AND INCLUDING BOTH BE BE MORE RESILIENT ALSO REDUCING THE THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT HITS US SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME SITUATION IN. IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO -- WHAT WHAT SO SO SO SO I I WAS? I'M THINKING LIKE HOW HOW DO WE HELP TO MAKE PRE FINDING MORE OF A REALITY -- YOU MENTIONED THAT I HAVE IS NOW STARTING TO ENTER INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT GENERAL ABOUT ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND THEY KNOW IS THIS. IS IS NOW BECOMING A PART OF WHAT FIX MATT OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT AT WHAT -- WHAT THE COUNTY OFFICES OUGHT TO BE LOOKING OUT WHEN THEY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT [inaudible] CONDITIONAL -- YOU KNOW I'M STAMP OF APPROVAL ON ON A DISTRICTS BUDGET THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY'RE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF THE LONGER TERM LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE TAKEN ON HOW HOW CAN WE HELP TO ENCOURAGE AND PUSH. OUT RESPONSIBLE PRE FINDING INTO THE FINANCIAL PRACTICES OF DISTRICTS. I MISTER SPEAKER THE QUICKLY IN A PASSIVE APOSTLE FOR THE PENSIONS THIS IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION THAT THE STATE SETS WITH THE DISTRICTS PAY TO THE PENSION PLAN. THAT'S STATE LAW AND AND THEY JUST FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE SO IT'S PRETTY FUNDED TO THE EXTENT YOU GUYS LEGISLATIVE TO BE REFUNDED AND FIVE FIVE BY CAL STIRS AS A WELL CAL STAR SPECIFIES A RATE BUT RIGHT OKAY SAMPLE OKAY SO I'M MORE TALK ABOUT HIGHER TO TWENTY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I'M PAYING WHAT HOUSE ARE SET RIGHT OKAY BUT YOU THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE RIGHT THERE? HELLO SO I'M ACTUALLY MORE TALKING TO TO TO MISTER BURN OUT. YEAH SO ON THE ON THE BEDSIDE THE ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT I MENTIONED OF PRE FUNDING ON THE OPEN SIDE I MEAN REALISTICALLY THERE ARE THE IT IS IT IS A SHORT TERM COST TO DISTRICTS TO BE PRE FUNDING AS THE EMPLOYEES ARE EARNING. THE BENEFITS AND I MEAN I THINK FOR THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS A DISTRICTS ARE FACING A LOT OF COMPETING PRESSURES -- JUSTICE PAYING INTO THE RAINY DAY FUND IS A SHORT TERM COSTS BUT IT'S GOING TO HELP US WIN. YES AND TO BE CLEAR THE THERE ARE INCLUDED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DISTRICT TWO INCREASINGLY REQUIRE THAT DISTRICTS ACCOUNT FOR THESE LIABILITIES FOR EXAMPLE AS EMPLOYEES ARE IN THEM RATHER THAN SORT OF NOT I CAN'T BRING THEM ON THE ON THE BOOKS UNTIL AFTER -- EMPLOYEES RETIRE BUT THEY DON'T REQUIRE PRE FUNDING I DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT -- PARTICULARLY NOW THIS IS INCREASED WHERE DISTRICTS NEED TO BE GETTING REGULAR -- ACTUARIAL REPORTS ON THEIR BED LIABILITIES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW -- FIGMENT DEALS WITH THOSE BUT I MEAN I DO I DO BELIEVE THEY ARE CONSIDERED AS PART OF DISTRICTS -- SORT OF A IN THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER DISTRICTS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD I'M NOT SURE I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE THAT SOMETIMES THE WINDOWS THAT ARE USED TO ASSESS DISTRICT BUDGETS OFTEN HAVE NOT PROJECTED -- IT FAR ENOUGH TO SEE SOME OF THE WHEN THE PUBLIC ABILITIES WILL BE BECOMING DO AS THAT MIGHT BE A FACTOR THERE BUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE THE PEOPLE DOING THAT THOSE BECAUSE THAT KIND OF MONITORING. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY EXAMPLES OF OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE'S WHERE WHERE STATE SAY DISTRICTS YOU KNOW HEY LOOK YOU'RE TôI WELCOME TO BARGAIN WHICH ONE A BARGAIN. THAT'S YOUR RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE TO THEN BUILD. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR BARGAINING IN NOT JUST. YOU DID YOUR CURRENT BUDGET NOT JUST -- ALLOW. THAT TO BE ON THE BOOKS FOR WAY OFF IN THE FUTURE I'M NOT OFF HAND BUT I CAN I CAN LOOK AND SEE IF STATES OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT BUT IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY YEAH. BECAUSE WASN'T GROUPS REALLY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS YOU KNOW THIS IS A SCHOOL WHERE MEMBERS IT. THESE ARE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE MADE THAT THAT THE CURRENT PORTAL NEVER REALLY HAVE. TO DEAL WITH -- ANY ANY AND THE REAL COST IN AND BY THE WAY THIS IS IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD NECESSARILY OUGHT NOT TO DO. I'M IF THAT'S THE PRIORITY THAT THE COMMUNITY THE BOARD AND AND THEN AND THE NEEDS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES THAT THAT'S THAT'S FINE BUT BUT IT OUGHT TO BE. BUILT INTO THEIR FINANCIAL MODEL IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD AND AND AND AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO THE ODD AT AFTER I'D LIKE. ACCOUNT FOR THAT WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THAT DECISION THESE ISSUES. THESE ISSUES AFFECT THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO BORROW FOR EXAMPLE. WITH BONDS AND AND RATINGS IS IT THE SAME ISSUE BONDS WE FACE IS A STATE OR I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I JUST ASKED. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF THEY'RE GOING TO SUCH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE SHOULD HAVE. SOME SORT OF EFFECT ON YOUR BOND RATING RIGHT. WELL IF IN FACT IT'S TRUE THAT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO IT MAY DRIVE A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR. TO GO. TO WITH MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION. I WAS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I WAS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS WHERE WE SERVICE THE ISSUE OF OF OF RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS AND THE THE LARGE LIABILITY AND WHO ONE SUGGESTION WE MADE IS THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE COMING OUT OF A RECESSION THERE'S COVER RECOVERY REVENUES ARE COMING BACK INTO PROP NINETY EIGHT AND USUALLY THERE'S SO ONE TIME FUNDS THAT -- BECOME AVAILABLE AND THAT. WE SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE COULD EARMARK SOME OF THOSE. ONE THAT REQUIRED DISTRICTS TO SPEND SOME OF THOSE ONE TIME MONIES ON RETIRING AND PRE FUNDING OR OR PUTTING MONEY AWAY FOR THIS LIABILITY. YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO HAVE A BIG INFLUENCE ON SCHOOL FINANCE. WHAT YOU'RE COMMITTEE DOES RIGHT? AND ONE TIME FUNDS. WE ARE A GOOD WAY TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN KINDS OF OBJECTIVES AND I THINK WE KIND OF THOUGHT GETTING DISTRICTS. THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE PUTTING MONEYASIDE FOR THEM IN A SENSE GETTING THEM STARTED ON RETAIN THAT THAT DEBT. OR YOU KNOW BUT ACCOMMODATING THAT DEBT -- WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT MAY BE THE STATE WILL CONSIDER SO. WE'RE GOOD WE'RE GONNA HEAR SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE NEXT ISSUE WHEN THE COASTERS FOLKS COME UP AND WE DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS KILLINGS. GERMAN IT'S AN EXCELLENT CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THE SUGGESTION JUST YOU MAY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. PUT TAKE ISSUE NUMBER THREE CAL STIRS PENSION PROPOSAL THIS ALSO IS AN INFORMATION ONLY ITEM WHAT [inaudible] NOW. WE OPPOSE OPTION FOR ONE K.. THEY HAVE. LIKE TO HAVE.

THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK ERIN TODAVíA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AGAIN AS WELL OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. ALTHOUGH IN THE JUST THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA HERE. SO -- GOOD AFTERNOON NOW HER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT YOU JUST WITH A BRIEF. OVERVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A TOTAL OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN RELIEF -- FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE ME BECAUSE GO DISTRICTS ON THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION. RATES. CAL STIRS -- AS I'VE BEEN HERE IN THIS -- COMMITTEE ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS MENTIONING JUST THE ROBUST INCREASES -- TO EDUCATION FUNDING UNDER BOTH PROPERTY EIGHT AND THEY'LL SEE IF F. OVER THE LAST A HANDFUL OF YEARS SINCE -- TWENTY THIRTEEN AS WE HAVE ALSO BEEN COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION AND OF COURSE THIS YEAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ALONE THE BUDGET PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AUGMENTATION TO THE CFF -- TO REPRESENT A THREE POINT 46% COLA -- ON TOP OF A MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THOSE WHO FOR FOR SEA GLASS HERE -- WITH ALL THAT THAT I'VE SAID AS I SAID TODAY IN IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS OF THE ADMINISTRATION DOES STILL RECOGNIZE THAT MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE RISING FIX COSTA DIFFICULT BUZZ BUDGET DECISIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE YOU HEARD OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. HERE FROM THE DIFFERENT PANELS -- AND I THINK THAT WAS HELPFUL FOR THE CONVERSATION -- AS ALL THE DISTRICTS -- GRAPPLE WITH THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING TOWARDS IMPROVING OUTCOMES YOU KNOW FOR ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS -- AND ADDITIONALLY BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES -- IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MONIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEE -- OUT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REX USING -- WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT THIS THIS YEAR'S -- MAY REVISION ON LIKE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT IN IN PREVIOUS YEARS -- WHEN THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REVENUE CHANGES AT THE MAJOR VERSION -- IN THE POSITIVE. DIRECTION -- WITHOUT SO IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT -- MAKING SOME LEASES WE HAVE TO MAKE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET OUTSIDE OF EDUCATION. I IN RECOGNITION OF THIS REALITY ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO MAKE A ONE TIME -- PROD NOT OPPOSITION NINETY INVESTMENT AND REALLY APPLY IN THE WAY THAT WE FEEL YIELDS THE BEST RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT -- BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM IN THE FORM OF RELIEF TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALSO IN THE LONG TERM TOWARDS PAYING DOWN. THE OF REMAINING UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS A SPECIFICALLY. A PROPOSED TO SPEND A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRE FIFTY EXCUSE ME. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EACH YEAR SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE INDIVIDUALLY -- EFFECTIVELY -- LOWERING THE CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR EMPLOYERS BY 1% IN EACH YEAR FROM EIGHTEEN POINT 1% DOWN TO SEVENTEEN POINT FROM NINETEEN POINT 1%. TO EIGHTEEN POINT 1% IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE LIKE I SAID APPROXIMATELY -- THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE IN SAVINGS TO EMPLOYERS IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS -- THE REMAINING TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY WILL GO TOWARDS PAYING DOWN THE LONG TERM UNFUNDED LIABILITY. ESTIMATED EQUAL ABOUT EIGHT POINT 5% REDUCTION IN FUTURE YEAR CONTRIBUTION RATES BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OF FOR A TOTAL ESTIMATED SAVINGS THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE CULTURES FUNDING PLAN OF ABOUT SIX POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS I WITH THAT I'LL INCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. WHAT'S WILL THROW THIS OUT WE DON'T HAVE TO ADDRESS IT RIGHT NOW THE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND CHANGE FOR THE THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THE THREE FIFTY THREE AND FIFTY MILLION FOR THESECOND YEAR. IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET PLAN THE ANALYSIS -- SPEAKS TO UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- FOR BENEFITS TURNED AFTER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND NOTE NOTES THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROJECTED TO GROW TO A BILLION. AND MY QUESTION IS THIS WOULD WE NOT BE. IF NOT BETTER OFF AT LEAST IN A GOOD POSITION. TO SORT OF SATISFIED THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY RATHER THAN LET IT GROW TO A BILLION AND IS THERE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THAT IN SOME WAY. AT SOME POINT JUST THINK ABOUT THAT -- LET EVERYBODY ELSE GET THROUGH AND THEN CAN WE JUMP BACK AND DEAL WITH THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO FORGET [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON NEWMAN -- MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS KENNETH COUPON WITH THE LEGEND OF THIS OFFICE. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT I THINK THE SERGEANT JUST DISTRIBUTED AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A LOT ABOUT COASTERS TODAY SO ALL -- DISPENSED WITH THE FIRST PAGE AND JUST BY WAY OF BRIEF BACKGROUND AND TURNING TO PAGE. TWO AND I WANTED TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN THE STATE ENACTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I CUSTER'S CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR BENEFITS AS TEACHERS OF BRING THEM FOR MOST OF THE SYSTEM HISTORY -- MOST OF ITS HUNDRED PLUS YEAR HISTORY. BY THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ARE REALLY ODD -- TWENTY TENS I SHOULD SAY -- THAT UNDER FUNDING HAD REACHED A CRITICAL POINT AND THE SYSTEM WAS PROJECTED TO RUN OUT OF FUNDING BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS. OF THE LEGISLATURE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THAT ISSUE IT HAD MANY MANY HEARINGS IT WAS OF A VERY. COMPLETE THOROUGH STUDY THAT WAS DONE MCALLISTER IS. AND THE LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY CRAFTED A PLAN AT WORK WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT BALANCE THE CONCERNS OF DISTRICTS -- WITH THE FUNDING NEEDS OF CAL STAR IS. AND HELP DISTRICTS WITH THE LOCAL BUDGETING -- THAT PLAN I GAVE DISTRICTS A SEVEN YEAR STATUTORY SCHEDULE SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION RATE WOULD BE EVERY YEAR THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND PLAN ALSO FACED IN HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR TEACHERS AS WELL AS THE STATE -- GENERAL FUND. THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO I THINK GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT PLAN WAS IN MOVING CAL STIRS MUCH DIRECTORY WHERE IT WAS -- ON TRACK TO ONE OF THE FUNDING MY ON TRACK TO REACH A FULL FUNDING -- OVER THAT SAME PERIOD. BUT AS YOU HEARD AND TURNING TO PAGE. THREE THIS IS A THIRTY TWO YEAR PLAN. AND SO -- PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY TODAY IS STILL QUITE LARGE OVER A HUNDRD BILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT AMOUNT. ABOUT SEVENTY ONE BILLION IS ASSIGNED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIRTY FIVE BILLION IS ASSIGNED TO THE STATE THOSE PERCENTAGES AREN'T FIXED THE LIABILITY KIND OF SHIFTS BETWEEN STATE AND DISTRICTS. EACH YEAR WITH UPDATED SORT OF ACTUAL NUMBERS AND INVESTMENT RETURNS AND OTHER FACTORS -- BUT STILL LARGE -- WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT JUST THE DISTRICTS HERE ORDER -- THIS YEAR FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND THEN THE UNASSIGNED SURE OF FIVE AND TWENTY THREE MILLION. THE GUY SAID IT WAS TWO HUNDRED MILLION IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE AND TWENTY THREE MILLION I THINK THE DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE AND HOW THE ASSETS ARE SORT OF BEING VALUED WITHIN CAL STIRS I CAN. SURE CHARACTERS CAN GIVE YOU MORE DETAIL ON THAT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT'S RELATIVELY MODEST NOW BUT IT WILL KEEP GOING I THINK OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RATES AND CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THEIR PROPOSAL. ALL DISTRICTS FACE THE SAME CONTRIBUTION RATE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE COST INCREASES THE FEES. BASED ON THE DECISIONS THEY'RE MAKING ABOUT -- THINGS THAT AFFECT PAY WELL MAINLY TEACHER SALARY IN CLASS SIZE. A SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE INCREASED THOSE THINGS MORE RAPIDLY OVER THE YEARS AND OTHER DISTRICTS ARE ALSO FACING CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER INCREASES IN THEIR HOUSES CONTRIBUTION COSTS. THE ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO PAGE FIVE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THEIR PROPOSALS. ONE POINTED EMPHASIZES THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSALS ARE SORT OF BOTH INVOLVING HEALTHCARE IS THERE REALLY A QUITE DIFFERENT IN THEIR OBJECTIVES. ARE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IS REALLY A PROPOSAL THAT'S ALL ABOUT BUDGET RELIEF BY DESIGN IT'S NOT INTENDED TO SORT OF IMPROVE OR WORSEN CAL STIRS CURRENT. FUNDING SITUATION IT'S REALLY ABOUT PROVIDING RELIEF FOR DISTRICTS IN THE IN THE NEAR TERM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. OF THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION IS SORT OF JUST THE REVERSE IT'S MAINLY A PROPOSAL ABOUT PAYING DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND THERE ARE SOME LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR DISTRICTS FOR THAT BUT THEY REALLY ARE IN THE LONG TERM THEY WON'T BE. A SORT OF ANY IMMEDIATE SAVINGS FOR DISTRICTS THE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT THERE COULD BE -- MORE MODEST SAVINGS OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. I TURNING TO OUR ASSESSMENT AND HE'S SIX I THINK THE REASON THAT% CAL STIRS HAS. ACOSTA BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION IS THAT THE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION RATE TODAY. ALREADY AROUND 16%. MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS LEVEL FROM FIVE YEARS AGO. AND DESPITE THAT INCREASE THE RATE STILL ISN'T AT THE LEVEL. WHERE IT'S NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF HE FUNDING PLAN? AND SO THE QUESTION I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUTS BEFORE YOU. ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT WHETHER TO INCREASE DISTRICT RATES BUT WHAT THE TIMING SHOULD BE AND WHEN THOSE RATE INCREASES SHOULD OCCUR. AT DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO SEE INCREASES IN RATES IS CHALLENGING IN ANY FISCAL ENVIRONMENT. BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS IN THE MIDST OF VERY STRONG ECONOMIC TIMES. A SCHOOL FUNDING AS YOU HEARD HAS GONE TWENTY TWO BILLION OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- SCHOOL FUNDING ON A PER PUPIL BASIS IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AND SO THE ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO SKETCH OUT FOR YOU. IS TO SATISFY THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BUT NOT USE IT TOO IMMEDIATELY I JUST DISTRICT. THREE INSTEAD LEAVE THE CURRENT RATES ON THEIR STATUTORY SCHEDULE. AND THAT INSTEAD USE THEM OUT. DURING THE NEXT DOWNTURN IN DISTRICTS MIGHT BE FACING PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT BUDGET CHOICES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN THE ARE TODAY. AND USE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO PROVIDE GREAT RELIEF AT THAT POINT. TURNING TO ACQUIRE THE FINAL PAGE PAGE -- SEVEN AND YOU PUT A LOT OF ALREADY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS FOR DEBTS AND LIABILITIES HIS CHARACTERS PROPOSAL IS JUST ONE OF MANY PROPOSALS YOU'VE HEARD YOU HAD A WHOLE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING ON THOSE TOPICS. I'M A COUPLE WEEKS AGO SO I WON'T FOR THE BELIEVER ASSESSMENT. BUT INBRIEF WE THINK THE STATE DOES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW WITH SUCH A LARGE A BUDGET SURPLUS. AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PAY OWN SOME LIABILITIES SEEMS PRUDENT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY. SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM SAVINGS. YOUR ACTIONS ON THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION I THINK ARE LIKELY TO DEPEND ON HOW WILLING YOU ARE TO ASSUME. SOME ADDITIONAL SHARE OF DISTRICT LIABILITIES. AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE ALSO HAS MANY OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDING LIABILITIES FOR ITS OWN EMPLOYEES AND PENSION COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT -- AND SO IT SORT OF COMES DOWN TO YOUR DECISION ABOUT ARE YOU WILLING. TO TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE THE SHARE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAN WAS ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED TO THE STATE. UNDER THE TWENTY FOURTEEN PLAN. A SO WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKEANY QUESTIONS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE DISTRICTS DISTRICTS OF ALREADY BUDGETED FOR THE RATE BY DOWN WHICH WOULD CAUSE. CHANGE AT THIS POINT WHICH MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS. IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE I THINK WE'D BE CONCERNED THAT THAT'S NO THAT'S NOT GOOD FISCAL PRACTICE TO BECOME SOMETHING FOR IT EVEN HAPPENS -- I THINK IN THE PAST DISTRICTS -- SOMETIMES THERE'S A PERCEPTION OF THE JANUARY BUDGET IS JUST KIND OF THE OPENING LEVEL AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WILL BE BETTER BY ME BUT YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THIS YEAR KIND OF LOOKING AT TAX RETURNS IN SOME OF THE OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS MAKE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER. AND SO I THINK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEND THE SIX SIX SIGNAL NOW OF OF CAUTION FOR DISTRICTS ABOUT BANKING EVERYTHING THAT'S NECESSARILY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT NOW CULTURES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BOTH THE GERMAN HAVE -- GONE OVER THE THE PROPOSAL'S VERY WELL THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB SO I WON'T REPEAT. THINGS THAT HAVE SAID BUT WHEN WE LOOKING AT THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL. THAT IS PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO CHARACTERS. AND WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. IT'S A VERY GOOD PROPOSAL AND WILL PAY DOWN. DEBT OVER THE LONG TERM. IN OVER THE LONG TERM THIS WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS TO THE STATE BECAUSE WE GET MONEY WE WERE ABLE TO INVESTED. AT LOW RIGHT NOW OUR ASSUMPTION IS 7%. BUT IN IN SOME CASES WE MAY BE MORE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS CAL STARTED. RATE OF RETURN IS AVERAGE EIGHT POINT 6%. SO WHEN WE HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN INVEST IT. IN THE SAVINGS DOWN THE LINE. CONTINUES TO GROW AND CONTINUE TO GROW MULTIPLY SO. THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK. AND OTHERS LIKE IT. ARE EXCELLENT IDEAS TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN THE FUNDING PLAN WHICH IS WORKING. IS WORKING SO OUR MENU SO FAR IT'S WORKING. IT'S FIVE YEARS THE THE THE PROPOSAL'SPASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT IT DIDN'T START TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN EFFECT SO IN EFFECT IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT. WHERE CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUMPED FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND SO FAR? IS WORKING VERY WELL SO WE SUPPORT. OPPOSED TO STRENGTHEN. THE THE FUNDING PLAN AND THIS IS ONE OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT WOULD DO SO AND SO WITH THAT I'M JUST. AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS WELL LET ME AS MY GENERAL QUESTION THAT I SORT OF ALLUDED TO AT THE BEGINNING WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE UNASSIGNEDUNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THAT -- EARNED WERE UNDER CRUDE AFTER TO THE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN YEAR SO SO RIGHT NOW IT. IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE INVESTOR RETURNS IN THE FUND IF THERE'S ENOUGH ACCESS. FROM THE INVESTMENT TURNS TO MAKE UP FOR THIS. SO. I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT. BECAUSE IT HASN'T GROWN VERY LARGE NOW BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. UNLESS A SOLUTION IT IS MADE ARE THAT THEIR ACCESS INVEST RETURNS TO COVER SO I MEAN I GUESS MY THOUGHT AND MY QUESTION IS MAYBE TO FINANCE. IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A YEAR THAT'S A GOOD YEAR WHO KNOWS IF WE FIND THAT. THE MISSING TWO POINT TWO BILLION OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS HAPPENS TO SHOW UP IN THE MAILBOX SOMEWHERE -- WHY WOULDN'T WE TAKE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND JUST BY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BE DONE WITH IT AS OPPOSED TO LETTING IT GROW? IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. ON ON UNFORTUNATELY MISTER CHAIR I PERSONALLY -- AM NOT -- I THINK WELL VERSED ENOUGH IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AT ALL AFTER OVER TO OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION FROM. WELL AS COASTERS OKAY SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T CONTROL THE STATE BUDGET SO WHAT WE IF WE TAKE TO AN EIGHT MILLION IT WOULD REDUCE THAT AND WE COULD ALLOCATE YOU CAN ALLOCATE THAT. TO TO THAT PIECE AND THEN ON THE BOOKS WE WOULD SHOW THERE'S NO MORE. UNFUNDED FOR THAT PIECE. THE ONE THING WE ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THE ASSETS WE HAVE ARE AT RISK. IN THE EQUITY MARKET SO WE MAY SEE IT AGAIN. SO YOU MAY SEE AGAIN OR YOU MAY SEE SURPLUSES SO WHAT HAPPENED IN -- LATE NIGHT -- NINETEEN NINETIES TWO THOUSAND THEY WERE JUST TREMENDOUS SURPLUSES BECAUSE OF INVEST RETURNS AND SO THAT'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY SO IT CAN GO EITHER WAY. I GUESS YEAH. THE GREATER ANY QUESTIONS EXCELLENT PRESENTATION. THANK YOU GERMAN. WITH THIS IS AN OPEN ITEM BECAUSE IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE HEARD FOR THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION LOCAL GOVRNMENTS AND WE WILL REVISIT THIS -- AT A LATER DATE WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS INVOLVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S TURN -- TO ITEM. SIX THREE FIVE ZERO OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION ISSUE NUMBER FOUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL FACILITIES. IN THIS WILL BE AN ITEM THAT WE ALSO HOLD OPEN BUT WE WERE HERE TODAY [inaudible] SO WELL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WILL IDENTIFY YOURSELVES STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. MA'AM [inaudible] THAT'S RICH. MRS SILVERMAN I'M EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. KEITH IS ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SISTERS -- THANKS FOR JOINING US. AND COUPON AGAIN WITH THE LEGEND LESS OFFICE -- YOU'RE STAYING WITH US. EMILY ALSO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU ALL WHAT'S TO START. A GOOD START -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE -- MY SOLVE AS YOU KNOW THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- I'M SORRY THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AUTHORIZING THE SALE OF SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN -- BOND FUNDING TO SUPPORT SCHOOL FACILITIES -- AND OF THAT AMOUNT THREE BILLION WAS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THREE BILLION FOR MODERNIZATION AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EACH -- FOR KERR CREE TECHNICAL EDUCATION FACILITIES AND CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES -- DA OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- VIA ARE ACTUALLY STATE ALLOCATION BOARD THE STAFF BY THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- AT THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DISPERSED FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION OF THESE BOND FUNDS IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT FIVE OR NINETY FIVE MILLION WILL BE DISPERSED AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO DISPERSE -- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER UNTIL BOND FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED -- TO MAKE MEET THIS GOAL -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES -- TEN POSITIONS AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE THE INCREASED WORKLOAD -- THERE'D BE NECESSARY TO PROCESS THAT ENOUGH APPLICATIONS TO DISPERSE THAT TARGET ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY I'M. WITH REGARDS TO DEBT SERVICE -- OBVIOUSLY A GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS ARE NOT FREE -- THERE'S THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID OVER A THIRTY YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD -- AND IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THAT THAT SERVICE FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE AS WELL AS NUMEROUS PREVIOUS SCHOOL FACILITY BONDS -- IS ESTIMATED WE TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILL BILLION THIS PROPOSED TO BE DISPERSED IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY THERE WOULD BE A ANNUALIZED THAT SERVICE OF EIGHTY FOUR MILLION -- AND OVER THAT THIRTY YEAR PERIOD WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S ABOUT SIXTY MILLION PER ONE BILLION. A BINDER. I DEPENDS ON INTEREST RATE -- SO THE THE NUMBER I'M QUOTING IS BASED ON A THREE POINT 75% INTEREST RATE WHICH WOULD BE -- FIFTY SIX MILLION PER BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT SERVICE PER YEAR OVER THE THIRTY YEAR. PERIOD -- SO THE STATE STATE BONDS ARE -- OF COURSE NOT THE ONLY -- FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR SCHOOL FACILITY COSTS THERE HAVE BEEN -- OVER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND A LOCAL BOND A GENERAL AVIATION BONDS AUTHORIZED BY LOCAL VOTERS -- AS WELL AS ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ON DEBTS -- DEVELOPER FEES THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE THE LOCAL THAT SERVICE FIGURES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEBT AND IN INVESTMENT ADVISORY. COMMITTEE COMMISSION -- SO WITH THAT AND THE THOSE OF THE OTHER FUNDING -- SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THERE'S ALSO OTHER PARCEL TAXES ARE AVAILABLE THEY WERE MUCH SMALLER -- DOLLAR FIGURES BUT THESE ARE THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE -- TO TO MEET THE SCHOOL FACILITIES OF THE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. CONCLUDE MY REMARKS DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA AS TO WHAT THE TOTAL NEED IN THE STATE IS. NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT THE BONDS ARE THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED -- AUTHORIZED. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- THERE ISN'T AN INVENTORY -- OF YOU KNOW. THE UNDER THE ALL THE SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT EXIST THAT EACH WITHIN EACH K. TWELVE AND SEE -- AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S THERE ISN'T AN INVENTORY OF TURN TERMS OF GE AND AND THE SILLY UPGRADE COST BUT TO THE EXTENT. DISTRICTS ARE SUBMITTING APPLICATIONS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION -- IN REGARDS TO THOSE PARTICULAR DISTRICTS BUT NOT AN OVERALL INVENTORY OF THE OVER ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AND I ONE THOUSAND CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BUT I GUESS THE THE ACCURACY OF THAT DATA WILL WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO ACCEPT APPLICATIONS. EVEN AFTER BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED OR WHETHER THERE'S A STOP AND IF IF THEY IF THE APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO FLOW AT SOMEPOINT WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE NEED IS. FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT GO TO THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING AN APPLICATION TOGETHER -- KNOWING THAT THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE POT. BUT I I WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS NO OVERALL STATEWIDE INVENTORY OF NEED AND I GET THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CARE EMILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A HANDOUT THAT WILL BE REFERENCING THERE ARE PRESENTATION. THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL COVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BOND SALE FIRST AND THEN MOVE ON TO THIS IS NEEDED STAFFING PROPOSAL. THIRTEEN ON PAGE ONE JUST TO PROVIDE SOME QUICK BACKGROUND AT IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHARE THE COST OF BUILDING NEW SCHOOL FACILITIES AND RENOVATING OLD ONES. THE STATE COVERS THAT SHARE USING VOTER APPROVED GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS AND THIS FUNDING IS AWARDED TO DISTRICTS THROUGH THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. DISTRICTS COVER THEIR SHARE THROUGH LOCAL BONDS. MOVING ON TO PAGE TWO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY COVERED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WHICH WAS PASSED IN. SIXTY SEVEN SIXTEEN BRIEFLY I THINK WE'LL JUST MENTION. THAT AT THE PREVIOUS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS TWO INSTALLMENTS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BONDS WHICH I WERE UNDER SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR EACH YEAR. THIS SET THIS SEAT ON A PIECE TO EXHAUST PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FUNDS AND IN TWELVE YEARS -- AT THE SAME TIME THE STAE HAD A GROWING BACKLOG OF SCHOOL FACILITY APPLICATIONS WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN APPLICATION STILL WAITING PROCESSING. AND LIVING AT THIS PAGE. THREE THE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SELL THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN SCHOOL BONDS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO MORE QUICKLY FIND PROJECTS WAITING IN THE PIPELINE. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVEL OF BOND SALES LEGISLATURE DISCUSSED IN THE BUDGET HEARINGS LAST YEAR AT THIS PACE IT WOULD TAKE A TOTAL OF SIX YEARS TO EXHAUST PIPE POSITION. FIFTY ONE FUND. STARTING ON PAGE FOR HOW WE MOVE ON TO THE GOVERNOR STAFFING PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INCREASE BOND SALES. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE ON PAGE. FOUR THERE ARE THREE MAIN AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE SEATS REVIEW PROCESS FOR OF A SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REVIEWS THANK APPROVAL AND PLANS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. THAT DIVISION OF THE ARCHITECT REVIEWS PLANS FOR SAFETY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS. AND OFFICE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION OPSEC PROCESSES SCHOOL FACILITY APPLICATIONS TO DETERMINE FACILITY -- FUNDING ELIGIBILITY AND THE PRESENTS PROJECTS TO THE C. ALLOCATION BOARD FOR APPROVAL. CURRENTLY -- PSE HAS FIFTY TWO AUTHORIZED POSITIONS HALF OF THEM ARE SIGNS TO THE AUDIT DIVISION AND THE OTHER HALF ARE% ASSIGNED TO THE PROGRAM SERVICES DIVISION. THE PROGRAM SERVICES DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS HANDLING APPEALS. PROGRAM POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. MOVING ON TO PAGE. FIVE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE A ONE POINT TWO MILLION -- I ONGOING AUGMENTATION FOR OPSEU TO HIRE TEN ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR APPLICATION PROCESSING THIS WOULD INCLUDE EIGHT ANALYSTS INTO MANAGERS. THE AD AUGMENTATION WOULD COME FROM PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FINDS. WE HAVE THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THE STAFFING PROPOSAL. FIRST WE BELIEVE OPSEU DEDICATES TI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FEW STAFF TO APPLICATION&lt;/c&gt; PROCESSING. CURRENTLY ONLY TEN FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE FIFTY TWO AUTHORIZED POSITIONS ARE DEDICATED TO THIS CORE FUNCTION. THIS IS LESS THAN 20% OF ALL PHYSICIANS. SECONDLY WE HAVE A RELATED CONCERN AT THAT THE REQUESTED TEN NEW POSITIONS IS MORE THAN -- PSE MAY NEED USING OPIATES OWNED LOGIC AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE STAFFING PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN APPLICATIONS COULD BE PROCESS WITH TWELVE EMPLOYEES. THIS IS ONLY TWO MORE THAN OPC CURRENTLY DEDICATES TO THIS FUNCTION WHEN WE BROUGHT UP TO THIS DIFFERENCE OPC INDICATED TO US THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL WORK ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. I AM SUCH AS UPDATING ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM AND HANDLING APPEALS NEVER THE LESS WE HAD CONCERNS THAT THE STAFFING PROPOSAL DIDN'T INCLUDE THESE ADDITIONAL WORK. AND IS ADDITIONAL WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE RATHER HIGH RELATIVE TO THE CITED TIME SPENT PROCESSING APPLICATIONS TO POTENTIALLY JUSTIFY TEN NEW POSITIONS. FINALLY WE BELIEVE SOME POSITIONS CAN BE REDIRECTED FROM PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. OUR TO PROCESSING APPLICATIONS FROM -- PC'S AUDIT DIVISION IN THE PAST OPSEU WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AUDITING PROJECTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY COMPLY WITH PROGRAM REGULATIONS AND THAT PROJECT PROPOSALS ORIGINALLY APPROVED. IN IT AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE SEAT DEVOLVED TO THESE AUDIT RESPONSIBILITIES TO LOCAL INDEPENDENT AUDITORS WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING STAFF REDUCTION TO OBESITY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT A P. C. HAS SOME WORK ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES AND IS STILL WRAPPING UP SOME PROJECT. HOWEVER AUDITING IS NO LONGER A CORE FUNCTION OF THIS AGENCY YET TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS ARE ALMOST HALF OF ALL POSITIONS ARE STILL HOUSED IN AUDIT DIVISION. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE OPC STAFF AND PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE FIND OKAY AS HE CAN MANAGE THE NEW WORKLOAD WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. LET ME JUST THROW THIS OUT. TO THE BROTHER OF FINANCING -- PSE BECAUSE A MEMBER OF THE NEXT -- I ASSUME WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING. THAT WHEN A PROPOSAL TO ADD -- TEN F. TEASES  TEN TEN F. FEES IS PROPOSED THERE'S SOME SORT OF MANPOWER STUDY THAT GOES ON I MEAN HAS IT HAS IT BEEN A MANPOWER STUDY. DONE INSIDE -- PSE TO EVALUATE WHICH WHAT EACH OF THE FUNCTIONS -- DOES. AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO DO IT. TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF MAN HOURS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH VARIOUS TASKS AND THEN CORRELATE THAT THE TOTAL OF TV'S AND THEN. THE INCREASE. I YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW AS WELL THROW THAT OUT. YOU MAKE COVERAGE MA'AM. YES ACTUALLY SOMEBODY TO WRITE THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDED TO AS FAR AS OUR BUDGET. CHANGE PROPOSAL SO YEAH THAT'S STUDY WAS PERFORMED AND THERE'S OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT WE DO OUTSIDE OF THE CORE. FUNCTIONS OF PROCESS A NEW CONSTRUCTION GRANTS AND MODERNIZATION GRANTS -- THERE'S OTHER PROGRAM GRANTS CAREER TECH ITS CATION PROGRAM GRANTS THAT THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LEFT OUT OF THE ORIGINAL -- PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE PROPOSAL THEIR CHARTER SCHOOL -- PROGRAM GRANTS THAT ARE ALSO -- MANAGED BY THE PROGRAM. THERE IS -- OTHER ITEMS THAT WE STAFF TO STAY LOCATION BOARD -- RELATED TO A FACILITY HARDSHIP PROGRAM GRANTS THERE'S GRANT AGREEMENTS THEIR ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT WAS BROUGHT ON AS AS THAT ADDITIONAL. OF GRANT ACCOUNTABILITY PROGRAM GRANTS AS FAR AS A AGAIN TO ENSURE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM AND THOSE ARE PROCESSED. IN ADDITION TO A APPROVING YOUR PROJECTS -- AGAIN THEY'R SMALL PROGRAMS THERE'S ALSO GRABBED ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PROGRAM THEY CAME AND FILLED A CANDOR. AND AGAIN THERE'S A GENDER PUBLICATION SO THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER WORKLOAD THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BOARD AGENDAS SO AGAIN WE DID A FULL STUDY OF OUR PROGRAM AND IT DID WARRANTED TEN ADDITIONAL STAFF. WHAT WHAT? WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE AUDIT? TO STEPHANIE AUDIT TEAM VIS A VIS OLD RESPONSIBILITIES NEW RESPONSIBILITIES AND I THINK THE REFERENCE WAS TO TWENTY FOUR OF TEAS. YEP WALL ONE CLARIFY THAT SO -- IT'S ACTUALLY CORRECT THAT -- AS FAR AS WHAT WAS ADOPTED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET -- THE LOCAL AUDIT RESPONSIBILITIES DID SHIFT. BUT WE STILL HAVE -- THERE IS STILL. OTHER AFTER WORKLOAD SO. PRIOR TO THAT SHIFTY AND THEY'RE STILLTWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN CLOSE OUT AUDIT SYSTEM HAVE TO PERFORM BUYER AUDIT STAFF -- SO THAT STILL ONGOING WORKLOAD THAT WE STILL HAVE -- EVEN THOUGH THE LOCAL AUDIT DID SHIFT THEY'RE STILL SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS -- THERE ARE THE K. TWELVE AUDIT GUIDELINES IS STILL HAD TO BE -- ADOPTED AND OF DEVELOP FIRE AUDIT TEAM -- THAT ALSO ENTAILED -- WILL STILL BE PART OF OF WORKING GROUP MOVING FORWARD SO ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE K. TWELVE AUDIT GUIDE THERE WILL BE RELYING ON OUR STAFF. TO A DOCTOR'S ADDITIONAL CHANGES THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL COUPON OF EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO THE LOCAL AUDITOR'S -- ALSO TO THE ALLEY ETS OTHER WE RELY IN OUR OUR STAFF -- TO PERFORM SOME REVIEWS OF A CURSORY REVIEWS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RICOTTA REQUIREMENTS THIS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO THOSE FOLKS. THERE'S ALSO THE BE IN PROGRESS PERFORMANCE CHECKS THAT ARE GONNA BE THE LOCAL WATER REQUIREMENTS SO AS WE MOVE% FORWARD -- THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT BACKING COMPLIANCE JACK -- THE PROJECT WILL HAVE IT IN PROGRESS PERFORMANCE SHOCK THAT ARE GONNA BE PERFORMED BY OUR STAFF SO AGAIN THE THE AUDIT WORKLOAD DIDN'T DIMINISH -- WE STILL HAVE THE CORE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE THESE TRACKS SO FINANCE WITH A B. C. P. IS OF IS SUBMITTED FOR AN INCREASE IN F. T. E.'S AND THERE'S I ASSUME SOME WORKSHEETS. THAT'S COMPLETED IS THERE ANY SORT OF INDEPENDENT CHECK OF THE ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS DONE BY THE THE DEPARTMENT OR IN THIS CASE. THE OFFICE -- WITH BACK TO THE NUMBER. YES CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE YOU KNOW FALL. PROCESS WE WOULD NEVER RECEIVED BCP'S FROM DEPARTMENTS WE LOOK AT THEIR CURRENT RESOURCES AND WE LOOK AT WHAT NEW WORKLOAD IS GOING TO BE INCOMING. AND WE WE WE COULD WE LOOK AT ALL THE FACTORS THAT EXIST I MEAN THIS IS A BOB IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- HAS BEEN FUNDED. YOU KNOW FIFTY TWO POSITIONS FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS -- PRIOR PRIOR -- TO WHAT DURING THE DURING THE PEAK -- BOND ISSUANCE PERIOD WHEN WE'RE ISSUE IN TWO TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR THIS OFFICE WAS STAFF THAT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POSITIONS -- RECENTLY THERE THEY WENT DOWN TO NINETY NINE BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND SO THIS FIFTY TWO POSITION -- FUNDING LEVEL A RESOURCE LEVEL IS IS A REFLECTION OF BASELINE WORKLOAD IS NECESSARY TO KIND OF HANDLE THE THE THE ALL PREVIOUS BONDS THEY'VE BEEN DISPERSED AND THEN THE WORKLOAD THAT GOES THEIR STAFF AND ALLOCATION BORDERS IN REFERENCE -- AND CERTAINLY. AS WE ADDED -- AS PROPERTY ONE WAS PASSED YOU KNOW AND OF IN THE FIRST YEAR AND NOW AND GOING TO THE SECOND YEAR BOND ISSUANCE. THERE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN RESOURCES FOR THE OFFICE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO RE DIRECT FROM OTHER CORE RESPONSIBILITIES TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS THAT WE'VE LAID OUT FOR THEM IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT THAT WAS ISSUED AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THE GOLD IS -- BEING AT THE OF A FIVE OR NINETY FIVE MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO YES WE WE REVIEW ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR THE THE PROGRAM AND AND WITHOUT THE TEN POSITIONS WAS WARRANTED IN IN ORDER TO MEET THAT TARGET. AND IN ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE DATES BECAUSE THERE ARE IT'S THERE ARE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY -- REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF REVIEWING APPLICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE COSTRUCTION PROJECTS. DENTAL FOR THE RESULT BASED ON YOU KNOW NOT A A LACK OF A THOROUGH REVIEW SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK. THERE IN ORDER TO MEET THE TARGET OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. WHEN I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I? I COME OUT OF THE MILITARY ALTHOUGH THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME AGO BUT I REMEMBER WE USED. TO PERIODICALLY GET THESE TEAMS IT WOULD DESCEND ON US AND THEY WERE CALLED MANPOWER SOMETHING TEAMS AND THEY COME INTO OUR WORKPLACE AND THEY TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE DO AND WE DO OUR WORKSHEETS AHEAD OF TIME AND THEY COME IN AND WATCH WHAT WE DO AND ASK. A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS AND TAKE OUR WORKSHEETS AND DECIDE WHETHER -- WE WERE RIGHT OR WRONG AND SOMETIMES YOU WOUND UP WITH MORE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES YOU ONE OF THE LESSON. THAT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MESSAGE AND THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING HOW WE DO IT IN THE STATE SO. IF WE DO SOME VERSION OF THAT THEN. THAT'SGOOD I WOULD ASK WELL LET ME THIS IS QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE HEARD MY COLLEAGUE COMMAND. AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING AND SUGGEST FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THAT WE SHOULD I GUESS SO ALL THE REMAINING BONDS. AND PUSH THOSE PROJECTS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN. WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON ON THE OFFICER YOU MANNED APPROPRIATELY FOR THAT -- AND FINANCE WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT MáS WILL TALK ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN. TECHNICALLY I'M NOT WE'RE NOT MAN FOR THAT EVEN AT OUR CURRENT% LEVELS AND EVEN AT TEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WE WERE NOT MEANT FOR THAT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OR ANY PROJECTIONS AS TO WHAT. ADDITIONAL F. T. EASE YOU WOULD NEED IN ORDER FIVE BILLION IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN IMAGINE BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE STAFF THAT FOR THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR WORKLOAD. YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO HIRE AND TRAIN FOLKS AND FOR TEN POSITIONS TO HIRE WHAT TO PUT OUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. YOU WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO TRIPLE THAT IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE. AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN AND HIRE FOLKS AND IT TAKES. AT LEAST EIGHTY MONSTER FOLKS TO BE PROFICIENT -- SO WHAT TIME YOU HIRE FOLKS AND GET THEM FISH THEY PUT OUT THAT WORKLOAD THEN YOU'RE AT LA OFF MODE. SO YOU'LL BE DIFFICULT TO HIRE FOLKS IN THAT SHORT PERIOD TIME AND TO PUT OUT THE FUNDS IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND THEN TURN AROUND AND LEAVE OAKS OFF SO THAT THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT BILLS. AND FROM THE DEBT SERVICE STANDPOINT FINANCE RIGHT WE WOULD ECHO EXACTLY WHAT -- LISA MENTION IN TERMS OF THEIR CAPACITY AND YOU KNOW HIRING IN AND LAY OUT STILL OCCUR BUT JUST IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL DEBT SERVICE COSTS I MEAN THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN ASSUMPTION OF DEBT SERVICE -- IN IN OUR MULTI YEAR ESTIMATES BASED ON ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GOING ON IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE EXTENT. SOMEHOW WE WERE ABLE TO DISPERSE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE DON'T THINK THERE'S CAPACITY DO THAT BASED ON THE NUMBER STAFF IT'S AVAILABLE -- THE FIRST YEAR'S DESERT HAS ROUGHLY WOULD BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND THAT IN THE SECOND YEAR IT WOULD BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THAT AND THIRTY JUST. IN COMPARISON TO THE PLANNED DISBURSEMENT THAT WE'VE BUILT INTO THE GOVERNOR SQUARE SO THESE ARE GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ABSORBED IN IN SOME OTHER. AREA OF THE STATE BUDGET. I THINK THERE'S ONE OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU IS PART OF THE EVEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. THERE IS DISTRICTS THAT ARE SEEKING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ASSISTANCE AND SO THAT'S THE STATE MATCH PROGRAM AND SO PART OF THAT MATCH BY REQUEST IS ACTUALLY -- HAVING A FINANCIAL REVIEW IN AND OUR ORDERS TO PERFORM THAT FINANCIAL REVIEW THERE'S AN ESTIMATE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE DISTRICTS CURRENTLY THERE WOULD BE REQUESTING THAT FINANCIAL REVIEW SO OUR AUDITORS WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE. HOW MUCH FUNDS AT THE DISTRICT HAS AVAILABLE AT TO SEEK THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO WHETHER NOT THE QUALIFIER THERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE? THAT IS A COMMON OUR AUDIT STAFF TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO ABSENT OF HAVING THOSE AUDITORS TO DO THAT FRONT IN REVIEW WOULD BE. PROCESSING THAT GRANT THAT FRONT AND REQUEST FOR FOR STATE ASSISTANCE AN INCUMBENT OF THE OUR STAFF PROCESS IN THE THE FUNDING APPLICATION SO THAT GOES HAND IN HAND. SO IF YOU START TRIMMING DOWN THE AUDIT STAFF. THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ALSO PROCESS THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION APPLICATIONS SO AGAIN I I THINK THAT WOULD BE. OF A MISTAKE TO OVERLOOK THAT THAT WORKLOAD AS WELL WELL THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM THAT WE WILL BE REVISITING I GUESS WHAT I'D ASK IS -- FOR THE OFFICE FINANCE IN LA -- TO SORT OF GET TOGETHER AND IF WE CAN -- COME TO SOME. MUTUAL AGREEMENT ON THE NUMBER OTHERWISE I GUESS WE'LL MAKE THE DECISION AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THAT MAKES SENSE [inaudible] AND IN. ACCESS ABSOLUTELY AND IN FRONT OF ME AS ONE FINAL QUESTION IS THERE SOME. OF STRATEGIC PLAN IN TERMS OF HOW TO ROLL UP THE REST OF THE BOND MONEY AT ABSENT SOME DUMP OF ADDITIONAL FIVE BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW. YES OUR OUR CURRENT PLAN IS TO DISPERSE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR AFTER NINETEEN TWENTY UNTIL THE BOND FUNDS OR SAUCES THAT BE THREE YEARS AND THEN THERE BE MAYBE A THREE HUNDRED MILLION LEFT. IN THE FOURTH BUDGET PLUS. THREE YOU PROBABLY SAID THAT I MISSED AND I APOLOGIZE NO FROM. WELL I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU -- BACK. LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IS FOR BECAUSE I THINK I'VE COVERED ALL THE ISSUES ON THE AGENDA. YES HELLO MY NAME IS JENNIFER BESTER AND I'M A VOLUNTEER RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR EDUCATE OUR STATE EDUCATE OUR STATE IS A STATE WIDE GRASSROOTS PARENT LED ORGANIZATION FOCUSED. ON A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILD. THANK YOU FOR A VERY WELL DOCUMENTED AND WELL CONSIDERED -- REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH AND ADEQUATE FUNDING. POURTANT LEE DOCTOR LEVIN MISTER BRUNO. ARE YOUR YOUR OWN REPORT RECOGNIZED THAT ACCOUNTING FOR LOCAL COSTS. IS A KEY ELEMENT IN ACHIEVING ADEQUACY AND EQUITY. ELEVEN YEARS AGO MICHAEL CURSED FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION DID THE SAME THING. IN THE LCF OF GROUP BLUEPRINT HE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WERE KEYED ANY RATIONAL EQUITABLE SCHOOL FINANCE SYSTEM. BECAUSE LOCAL COSTS ARE IGNORED NLC FF HOWEVER MAJOR DAMAGE IS INFLICTED ON THE POOREST AND MOST DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN OUR WEALTHIEST COUNTIES. THE GOOD NEWS SENATOR ROCK. IS THAT THERE IS IN FACT SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. THAT IS ALLOCATED TO EDUCATION IN THOSE MOST EXPENSIVE COUNTIES THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING RE DIRECTED TO OTHER USES. THIS IS TAX REVENUE THAT COULD COVER THE LOCAL COST DIFFERENCES IN SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATTEO MARIN SANTA CLARA. BUT IT. CANNOT DO SO NOW BECAUSE THE STATE DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DIFFERENCE. IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE WHO WOULD POINT TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. OF EDUCATION ALLOCATED PROPERTY TAX THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO EDUCATION I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED. SO AND IT'S GROWING IT'LL PROBABLY GROW A NUDGE ABOUT A BILLION THIS YEAR AS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WE SEE IN THESE HIGH COST AREAS. DISTRICTS CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND HARD PLACE OF ALL QUENEAU AND A FLOOD AND LISTENING TO A MISTER FINE. I SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD DISTRICTS DROWNING AND BAD ONES EXPLODING. SO WE HAVE TO MESH AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MASH THESE THREE ISSUES IN THE MAY REVIVE EQUITY. LOCAL COST OF LIVING. AND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF EXCESS EDUCATION ALLOCATED PROPERTY TAX. I HOPE YOU WILL ACCEPT THAT AMIR PARENT MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. WE PREPARED AN ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION OF EXCESS EDUCATION REVENUE THAT WAS FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO IN NOVEMBER. IF I MAY PRESENTED THANK YOU -- TO MS NGUYEN IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE YOU BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO OUR FULL. OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS WE WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR SHARING. SIR GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR ROBB THEIR CLINICS ON BEHALF OF THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE HE ASIAN -- I WANT TO SPEAK FIRST ON THAT PENSION ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF DISHES DIFFERENT ISSUES RELATED PENSIONS -- DURING THIS HEARING BUT THE ONE POINT THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRIVE HOME NOT JUST FOR SMALL BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT CLIENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. IS THAT THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR CAL STIRS PROPOSAL. IN SPITE OF THE MANY OTHER GREAT PROPOSALS THAT ARE OUT THERE MAYBE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL AS PART OF THE K. TWELVE BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND THE REASON IS NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE IT'S RELATED PENSIONS WE BECAUSE IT'S THREE BILLION DOLLARS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE FOR PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT PEOPLE OFTEN JOKE THAT THE I FLOOR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CREATED BY PROP NINETY EIGHT IS NOW ACTING LIKE A CEILING WELL HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT BY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. SO I JUST DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO BROADLY SUPPORTED YOU'RE NOT HEARING SUPPORT FOR IT -- I THINK EVERYBODY IN LINE HERE PROBABLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AND I WANT TO REITERATE THAT AND THEN LASTLY ON THE FACILITIES PROPOSAL NOT WITHSTANDING THE GREAT PARNERS THAT WE DO HAVE IT -- PSE IN THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY DO WITH THEIR LIMITED STAFF THE ONE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CENTER REQUIRES ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL -- ESPECIALLY IN SMALL IN RURAL AREAS -- THAT MONEY REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE AND IF WE CAN GET OUT TO THEM FASTER THAT'S CRITICAL FOR THE SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS FROM. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IF IF OUR MEMBERS HAVE OF OUR RETIREMENT COMMITTEE AND TEACHERS WERE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN REGARD. TO A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS VERSUS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSIONS AND THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A RETIREE HEALTH THEY WOULD BE VERY DISAPPOINTED -- AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD FEEL THAT THE PANEL WAS BIAS. OR N. SUPPORT OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS AND RETIREE HEALTH IT WHICH HE IT IS QUITE THE CONTRARY YOU MAY PLEASE FOLKS IT WE WOULD ASK THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT TEACHERS BENEFITS SUCH AS RETIREMENT IN RETIREE. HEALTH OBLIGATIONS THAT IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR IN NEUTRAL -- AND NOT IN A WAY THAT'S DEROGATORY TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT WOMEN. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING WOMEN SITTING. IN THE CHAIRS AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE STAFF IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GENDER EQUITY ISSUE AS WELL BECAUSE 72% OF RETIRED OR OF CAL STARS MEMBERS. ARE WOMEN. SO WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT WELL LET'S TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR RETIREE HEALTH OU'RE TALKING ABOUT DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN. BECAUSE WOMEN ALSO LIVE LONGER SO THEREFORE THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MIGHT BE WORKING TO INFLUENCE. ARE GOING TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT WOMEN AND ELDERLY WOMEN WHO LIVE LONGER STATISTICALLY THAN ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE COUNTRY. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT AS YOU'RE REFLECTING ON THESE THAT YOU ALSO PUT ON A LENDS A GENDER EQUITY. AND ASK THE QUESTIONS. THAT -- YOU CAN CONSIDER THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE ACTIVE TEACHERS BUT ARE RETIRED TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SECURE LIVING. BECAUSE HAVING A SECURE RETIREMENT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT ACTUALLY KEEPS TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TEACHERS IN KENTUCKY. HAD A STRIKE BECAUSE LEGISLATORS AND NOT STATE WANTED TO ELIMINATE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS AND MOVED TO RE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AND THE TEACHERS OF THAT STATE SAID THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR US PENSIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO ENTERTAIN DISCUSSIONS OF ELIMINATING A SECURE RETIREMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S TEACHERS. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE TO THEIR RETIREMENT BENEFITS AS WELL AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE IS WORKING IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED THE ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT RETIREMENT FUNDING THE ISSUE IS ABOUT A LACK OF ADEQUATE EDUCATION FUNDING. AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO pPARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES HAVE. THANK YOU WELL I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISINTERPRET WHAT. OCCURRED HERE TODAY I DO HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS BUT I'M SURE THERE WITH -- AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NOT MORE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE SAME QUESTIONS BUT I ALLOW PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE AND WANT TO ASK THEM. ON THE SUBJECT OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE AND VERTICALLY RETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PROVIDED TO THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER I WOULD WELCOME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON THAT ISSUE JUST TO INFORM MYSELF AS TO THE REASONS WHY -- FOR EXAMPLE MEDICARE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT AS AN OPTION IS IS REJECTED IN SOME DISTRICTS IN FAVOR OF A CONVENTIONAL A HEALTH PLAN THAT CONTINUES ON BEYOND AGE SIXTY FIVE IN THE COST DIFFERENTIAL IN THAT. OTHER MAYBE SOME ISSUES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE THESE ARE LOCALLY NEGOTIATED -- ISSUES AND WE DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN LOCAL NEGOTIATIONS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IN THIS BUILDING. FROM THIS POSITION BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING ISSUE THAT SOME DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND THIS PORTION THAT PORTION WAS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND I'M SIMPLY INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHY -- WHY THE STAKEHOLDERS IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY DO AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IF ANY? AND IF THERE ARE NONE THAT I GUESS WE CLOSE THE BOOK AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER ISSUE BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU COMING AND STAYING TO THE HEARING AND OFFERING YOUR COMMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A FOR THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SERRA BOTCHES WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFIIALS BOTH IN SUPPORT OF ITEM THREE AN ITEM FOR A FIVE REGARDING INCREASING PROVIDING. FUNDING FOR CUTS PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL AS FACILITATING THE RELEASED THE PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE DOLLARS. REPRESENTING THE FOR THE SCHOOL FISCAL SIDE WE REALLY ARE VERY GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL FOR TODAY'S CONVERSATION I THINK AFTER THE POP PASSAGE OF PEPPER WE HAVEN'T HAD AN IN DEPTH CONVERSATION OF REALLY THE THREE FOLD ON HOW WE ARE. NEEDING THESE A LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS AND PAYING DOWN OUR DEBT AND SO WE WELCOME ANY OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE COULD HAVE REELS. CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICERS AT THE TABLE TO REALLY ENGAGE ON WHAT OUR BEST PRACTICES HOW ARE WE MITIGATING ALL OUR ISSUES. IN LIGHT OF WHAT REALLY IS OUR PRIMARY MISSION WHICH IS TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU THANKS FOR COMING. SENATOR ROBB NOT TO TRY TO SUSPEND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING CASH -- YOU ASKED IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION OR SOMEONE COULD QUANTIFY FOR YOU THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NEED I THINK THE RESPONSE HE GOT WAS ACCURATE AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A STATEWIDE INVENTORY PER SE THAT QUANTIFIES ALL OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION NEEDS. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT THAT GUIDES US THAT WAY SO WE DO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE BACKLOG OF PROJECTS ALREADY PROCESS THAT THE STATE OF THE STATE ALLOCATION BORDERS FOUR POINT SEVEN EIGHT BILLION. AND THAT -- THE MODERNIZATION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE ARE NOW OVERSUBSCRIBED SO SIMPLY IF YOU COUNT THAT ONE PROGRAM AND ALL OF THE HOOPS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE NEED IS GREAT -- SINCE FACILITIES -- PROGRAM BOND FUNDS HAVE BEN APPORTIONED WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF PASSAGE OF THE RESPECTIVE BOND AT THE CURRENT RATE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL SET AN ALL TIME LOW OF ABOUT 50% WITHIN FOUR YEARS -- WITH QUALIFIED UP STILL WAITING IN THE QUEUE UP AND WE THINK THAT THEY CAN DO BETTER -- SO WE SUPPORT MISTER MAGUIRE'S PROPOSAL TO EXPEDITE A STATE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM APPORTIONMENT AND IN ADDITION CASH HAS OFFERED THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD -- PCIN THE ADMINISTRATION SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO WITHIN THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY TO HELP EXPEDITE THESE APPORTIONMENT SUCH AS RETURNING TO THE AB FIFTY FIVE INTERNAL LOAN PROCESS APPORTIONING ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF THE PRIORITY IN FUNDING. ROUNDS WHICH IS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR -- OFTEN WE HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY THEY DON'T -- MY GUESS HAVE THE SAME SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THOSE OF US IN THE FIELD TO ABOUT PROJECTS AND SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE PROJECTS IN THE QUEUE OUR REIMBURSEMENT PROJECTS -- WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT REIMBURSEMENT PROJECT THAT THE STUDENTS -- SERVE BY THOSE PROJECTS ARE JUST AS DESERVING AS STUDENTS -- WITH OTHER PROJECTS -- AND THAT IT'S IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO TO SET UP SOME KIND OF TWO TIER SYSTEM -- WE'VE ALSO HEARD FREQUENTLY ABOUT CONCERNS OF RELATED TO INTEREST ON DEBT SERVICE WITH -- STATEWIDE BONDS -- BUT WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. INCREASING OR OR EXPEDITING APPORTIONMENT OR PROCESSING A STATE SCHOOL OF FACILITY PROGRAM PROP -- PROJECTS DOESN'T ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT SERVICE IT JUST MOVE THAT UP IN TIME AND IF YOU FACTOR IN THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND INFLATION COST. YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SPEND LESS MONEY IF YOU FUND THOSE SOONER AS OPPOSED TO LATER AND THEN OF COURSE -- WITH RAPID COST ESCALATION THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR THE VOTERS AND AND THE REST OF US WOULD ALL GET MORE VALUE FOR MONEY IF WE EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING OF ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS. I THINK THAT INTERESTED TO DO WITH THEM. WITH THE MONTHLY A PORTION OR WHATEVER USE ALLOCATION WHATEVER WORD YOU USE AND THE I ASSUME THAT MEANT THE BONDS ARE SOLD AND SITTING THERE AND THEN THE MONEY IS ROLLING OUT ITS CREW STATES PAYING INTEREST ON IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WITH THE USE OF AB FIFTY FIVE LONG -- THAT ISN'T YEAH THERE THERE ARE SOME INTEREST -- ISSUES RELATED THERE BUT SINCE WE AS A STATE HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY USING THIS MECHANISM WE DO KNOW THAT IT ALSO ENDS UP BEING TO THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE TO THE TO THE VOTERS. THAT WE USE THAT INTERNAL MECHANISM IT'S CHEAPER THAN GOING TO THE PRIVATE MARKET AND AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO COST ESCALATION WE STILL COME OUT. BETTER BECAUSE OF THAT -- I WILL THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA -- FOR WORKING WITH US WE PLAN TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS INVOLVING STAFF -- CASH ALSO HAS A PROPOSAL TO GET US OUT OF BOND FINANCING AND WE DO HOPE TO ENGAGE IN THE LEGISLATURE. OF GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEED IS GREAT AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SPEED PROJECTS ALONG SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. YES MA'AM. ON BEHALF OF THREE ORGANIZATIONS THE SCHOOLS FOR SOUND FINANCE THAT CAL STARS FUNDING COALITION AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FUNDING COALITION WHICH IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE WANT TO REALLY SUPPORT THE CAL STIRS FUNDING PROPOSAL THAT GOVERNOR NEW SOME HAS -- HAS PUT OUT THERE -- TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS -- FROM MISTER LENNIX -- EARLIER -- THIS AFTERNOON THIS IS A VERY MUCH A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED AND UNIVERSALLY SUPPORTED PROPOSAL WE THINK THE STRUCTURE-- THAT GOVERNOR SOME AS PUT FORWARD MAKES A LOT OF SENSE JUST MOVE THOSE RATES -- IN TERMS OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT THE QUESTION ARE DISTRICTS PLANNING ON THIS I WOULD SAY YES BUT DISTRICTS ALREADY ARE ALREADY THINKING WHAT COULD THEY DO WITH THOSE DOLLARS THOSE DOLLARS THAT THEY HAD PLANNED TO SEND OVER TO STORES WHAT COULD THEY DO. BETTER WITH THEM LOCALLY IN THEIR CLASSROOMS -- SO I I KNOW THAT -- YOUNG MAN THE MAYOR VISION POTENTIALLY IS NOT AS STRONG -- SO WE WANT TO MAKE pPRIORITY ESPECIALLY SINCE THESE ARE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS AND BOTH UNDER SORT OF THE THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OTHERS. AND MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME INTEREST SO WE REALLY HOPE THIS IS -- HIGH PRIORITY FOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE THANK THANK YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US YES SIR -- IS THE CHAIRMAN OF A SHY THE PROCESS WITH THE COMPANY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. I'M YET TO ASK PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO CLASSIFY STAFF. ON THE PENSION ISSUE WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNMENT FOR SETTING ASIDE. NON NINETY A ONE TIME FUNDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WHAT A CLASSIFIED STAFF AS WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION DIRECTLY? INTO CALPERS THE IMAM WOULD BE A LOT LOWER IS ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION IF YOU WANTED TO THE THREE BILLION EQUIVALENT. AND FOR THE 1% REDUCTION PUT A NOTE FROM THE FIRST TWO YEARS. INSTEAD OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE EACH YEAR OR THREE HUNDRED MILLION. WE WOULD JUST ASK OF PARITY SCHOOLS CANNOT RUN WITHOUT A MEMBERS. WHO HAD SHOULD THE KIDS GET TO SCHOOL AT THE FOOD SERVICE PROVIDED? PROTECTED ON THIS C° SITE ABOUT CAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM ALONG WITH TEACHERS. OF FOR THOSE REASONS WE REALLY -- TO TO ADOPT SOME KIND OF PROPOSAL TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTION ABOUT MEMBERS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE TOO ARE FACING RISING COSTS. AND JUST REALLY BRIEFLY I KNOW IT'S LATE IN THE DAY ON YOUR CONVERSATION ON PENSION OBVIOUSLY WE CARE QUITE A BIT. AND SOME OF THE CONVERSATION. LEAVE US SOME CREE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PANEL TALK ABOUT WHITE ACOSTA GOING UP -- IN TERMS OF STATE POLICY. OF RECOGNIZING PEOPLE LIVING LONGER HAS INCREASED THE COST. STATE THE STATE DECISION TO AMORTIZE THE THREE EARLIER THIS THAT A THIRTY A TWENTY YEARS HAS INCREASED THE CAUGHT. IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT WAS LEFT OUT IS THAT. YOU KNOW IF THE STOCK MARKET HAD CRASHED THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SQUATS HI. AT TWO POINTS WITHIN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN THE LATE NINETIES IT WAS A 128% FUNDED. IN A I BELIEVE -- TEN YEARS AGO RIGHT BEFORE THE STOCK MARKET CRASH WE HAD A HUNDRED AND 1% FUNDED. OF THE THESE FUNDS. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RUSHING TO SOLVE SOMETHING THAT LIKE MORTGAGE. WE SHOULD TRY TO PAY IT ALL OFF A COMMA THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ADDRESS OVER TIME THE EMPLOYEES ARE READY TO SIT DOWN. AND TALK TO THE EMPLOYEES AND WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THERE WAS NO. RECOGNITION THAT'S THE CAN DOWN TO FAX HAD INDICATED WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADEQUACY HERE. SO THE FOCUS ON PENSION IN OF ITSELF OUTSIDE OF THESE CONTACTS WITHOUT RECOGNIZING ALL THE FACTORS APPROPRIATELY. COULD RUSH SOMEBODY TO JACK TO THERE'S SOME. REAL PROBLEM I HAD WITH US SAYING THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS THEM. BUT THIS IS BY TO POSE BORDERS DOES BOARD HAVE BEEN MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO DAL WITH THESE ISSUES. AND WE THINK THAT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING IS GREAT. PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO CLASSIFY STOP WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY RECOGNITION. THESE FUNDS WOULD BE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT HELP SCHOOL DISTRICT AS THE FACING ALL THESE ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. GOOD POINT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE MEMBERS DO. YES MA'AM GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSORTIUM REPRESENTING COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FACILITIES ISSUES. MY COLLEAGUE AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ALSO WANTED TO ASSOCIATE -- HER -- COMMENTS WITH MINE AS SHE WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. COUNTY OFFICES SERVE A REALLY UNIQUE AND DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS THINK STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION COURT SCHOOL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. WE HAVE VERY SPECIALIZED FACILITY NEEDS THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PASS LOCAL BONDS WE DON'T LEVY DEVELOPER FEES AND SO WERE OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON THE STATE. FOR FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT RENOVATE AND REPAIR OUR FACILITIES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE STUDENTS. BECAUSE OF THIS WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL THAT SENATOR MCGUIRE BROUGHT FORWARD TODAY WE ARE PART OF THAT COALITION AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE STAFFING INCREASE THAT WAS REQUESTED IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING OF THE APPLICATIONS AT THE PSC. WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE COUNTY OFFICE PROJECTS AROUND THE WORKLOAD LIST RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LIST THAT'S WAITING FOR APPORTIONMENT. AND MOST OF THOSE ARE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP APPLICATION SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED THOSE FUNDS FROM THE STATE BEFORE WE CAN COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION ON THESE IMPORTANT PROJECTS. THERE ARE PROJECTS ON THE LIST RIGHT NOW THAT WERE SUBMITTED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT'S FIVE YEARS LATER AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT. SOME SORT OF INTERNAL BORROWING OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL MECHANISM AND MANY OF MY MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THESE NEEDED FACILITIES. I'M THEIR BEEN QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE RAISED ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT QUESTION YOU KNOW DO YOU CREATE TO TEARS. FIND THOSE FIRST TWO NEED THE FUNDS IN ORDER TO COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT APPROACH EVEN THOUGH WE'RE THE ONES THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM DOT WE BELIEVE THAT ALL -- PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE AND HAVE MET THE STATE LAWS THAT WERE IN PLACE WHEN THEY SUBMIT IT SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE SAME -- WE KNOW THE NEED IS THERE WE KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS THE CAPACITY TO FUND THESE PROJECTS. I THINK THE QUESTION REALLY ABOUT THAT SERVICE IS WHAT BUDGET YEAR WILL YOU A CREW AND PAY THAT -- THAT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION THE OBLIGATION IS THERE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S THIS BUDGET YEAR NEXT BUDGET YEAR OR THREE YEARS OUT BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO ADMINISTER NINE BILLION DOLLAR BOND PROGRAM THAT WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS. KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS -- WE SUPPORT MOVING QUICKER ON GETTING THIS FACILITIES DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR THANK YOU THANK YOU SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. CERTAINLY NEED FACILITIES. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH AND STAFF -- JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. I LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE SENATOR MAGUIRE'S PROPOSAL TO EXPEDITE THE SALE AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE BOND. FINDINGS FROM PROPOSITION. FIFTY ONE AND A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AS A RESULT OF YOUR VERY RICH CONVERSATION ABOUT FISCAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SPECIFICALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING -- ALVORD UNIFIED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY I THINK IT PROVIDES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WORK THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN DOING WITH ALVORD. OF WHEN THE LETTER OF LACK OF GOING CONCERN. WHEN OUT IN NOVEMBER OF THAT STARTED A PROCESS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS TAKING PLACE? BETWEEN HER COUNTY OFFICE FISCAL TEAM AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME TO LIGHT AND THE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY DELVE INTO. DURING YOUR CONVERSATION -- THIS MORNING WAS THAT OUR OUR INITIAL CONCERN WAS THAT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE DISTRICT WAS PROPOSING TO MEET THEIR FISCAL OBLIGATIONS. WHAT ESSENTIALLY HAVE REMOVED STRATEGIES FROM THEIR LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS OR THE DASHBOARD IDENTIFIED GAPS? NONE OF US WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN OF COURSE AND I SUSPECT THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AS WELL. WE'VE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THEM. AND A I THINK OF BUDGET STABILIZATION PLAN THAT SATISFIED. OF OUR FISCAL TEAM I HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND NOW IT REALLY RESTS IN THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNING BOARD. AND IN HER LAST LETTER TO THE DISTRICT -- JUST WANT TO READ YOU A COUPLE OF QUOTES FROM OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT DR WHITES LETTER. ONLY THE DISTRICT'S GOVERNING BOARD CAN TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO CORRECT THE DISTRICT'S CURRENT FISCAL CHALLENGES. AND SHOULD THE DISTRICT FAILED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ACTION. THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WILL INVOKE ALL AUTHORITIES AT HER DISPOSAL INCLUDING THE ASSIGNMENT OF A FISCAL ADVISER. WITH STAY IN RECENT POWER OVER THE GOVERNING BOARDS DECISION. CLEARLY WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I DON'T THINK THE DISTRICT WOULD WANT US TO DO THAT -- WE'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT IF NEED BE -- AND IN APRIL IN LATE APRIL ARE -- DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT MISTER JUST UP AND ARE FISCAL TEAM WILL BE MAKING A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD THAT NIGHT. AND I SUSPECT IT WILL BE AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR ALL INVOLVED BECAUSE THAT WILL BE WHERE -- ESSENTIALLY THAT IT WILL BE LAID OUT FOR THEM WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. BUT THEN IT WILL BE IN THEIR HANDS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD. A PROBABLY A TOPIC FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ON A LATER DATE. BUT A GOOD FLASHLIGHT INTO SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL CHALLENGES FACING. A DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT ISSUE THANKS FOR BEING THERE IS SIR AIRBAG WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION HAPPY TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND TIME TONIGHT -- PROVIDING US THIS OPPORTUNITY WE JUST WANTED TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS -- FIRST ON RECOGNIZING THAT WERE OF VERY -- THANKFUL -- FOR GOVERNANCE AND AND THE CHARACTERS -- PROPOSAL THAT IS UP ABSOLUTELY WELL NEEDED BUT WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE NEED TO ADDRESS OUR CALPERS PARTNERS ARE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. THEY REPRESENT ABOUT HALF OF OUR CERTIFICATED PAYROLL AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE FOLKS AND ATTENTION THAT IS NEEDED -- TO BOTH FOR ARE THOSE EMPLOYEES BUT AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TO MAINTAIN BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS AS WELL THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S PARITY IN ONE PROPOSAL FOR ONE SET OF IN PLACE AS WELL AS THE OTHERS WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. THAT CONCERN IN OUR SUPPORT FOR THEM. THE SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO ITEM FIVE AND CSPA SUPPORT -- FOR CENTER REQUIRES PROPOSAL WE ARE PART OF THAT COALITION. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT -- THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS -- IS UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY BUT THEY ARE LINING THEIR COMMENTS WITH MINE AS WELL ON THIS ISSUE. AT THE NEED -- TO ISSUE THE THE DEBT. ON THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS IS CRITICAL AT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD OF BEFORE THAT THERE IS A RISING COSTS OF THIS -- COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION AT THE NUMBER PROJECTS IT'S GONNA TAKE OVER THREE YEARS TO RELEASE THOSE FUNDS YET COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE. I THINK A LOT OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF COST ESCALATION IS THE ABSENT FLOWS OF FUNDS AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE STATE PARTICIPATING PROVIDING. A CONSISTENT FORM OF FUNDING -- AND IT'S RELYING ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THE LOCALS TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN'T ENFORCE AND THAT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THIS WORKLOAD LESS GET BACK TO A STABLE LEVEL OF CONSISTENT FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN PLANT. AND ASSET THE MARKET. THE MARKET IS AND DRIVING OUR COSTS. WE CAN ACTUALLY DO A LOT BETTER AND DRIVING DOWN THE COST FOR RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T DO THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THINGS. I KNOW IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT THE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS CONTRIBUTED TO THAT AND WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO GET OUT OF IT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW WITH THE AVAILABLE BONTA STORY THAT WE HAVE. TO STEP UP BUT THE MONEY OUT THERE CITIES PROJECT CAN GET AND WE CAN THEN SET THE TABLE AND STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MARKET SO WITH ENCOURAGED US SUPPORT OF ITEM FIVE AND HOPE THAT IF WE CAN BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IS THAT CONVERSATION GO FORWARD WILL. ON PARTICIPATE IS THERE A CALPERS PROPOSAL GOING BACK TO YOUR FIRST POINT. AT SUPPORT AT THE EXISTING -- CASTERS BUT IS THERE A CAL PERS. WE WILL SEE WANT TO SEE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE SO IF BASED ON AND PLAIN VOLUME -- WE WOULD THINK THAT A REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP THERE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING SET ASIDE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK AT THAT'S MORE BUT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR COMING. YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CALLING MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION WHERE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE FACILITIES ISSUES -- DISCUSSED TODAY THIS FOUR POINT OF FACT -- RELATIVE TO THE BOND THERE WAS THERE WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST BOND FOR CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PARTICULARLY SATISFIED WE HAD ALMOST A TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF APPLICANTS FOR THAT THAT MONEY SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF OF THE SCALE OF OF THE NEED OUT. THERE -- ONE PROGRAM THAT I DO WANT TO MENTION IS THE SB SOME FORTY FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH DOES PROVIDE A SURE OF COST PER PUPIL ALLOCATION. FOR FACILITIES -- FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE SERVING STUDENTS IN -- THESE FACILITIES. IN A VERY HIGH -- I NEED AREAS SERVING HIGH NEED STUDENTS -- THAT THAT PROGRAM IT DOES HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE BOND PROGRAM WHICH IS RELATIVELY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE -- THEN THE PER PUPIL ALLOCATION OF PROGRAM -- THE PROGRAM IS -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDED AT PRIOR YEARS LEVEL -- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WHO ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM THAT -- CURRENT YEAR THERE IS -- ANTICIPATED TO BE ABOUT A TWENTY MILLION AT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IN THE PROGRAM I'M IN CURRENT YEAR -- IT THERE THEY'LL BE UPDATING THOSE ESTIMATES -- SOONER SOONER AROUND MAY REVIVE VISION TO TO KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH SHORTFALL IS -- WHEN THAT PROGRAM IS UNDER FUNDED -- IT DOES CREATE -- PRO RATIONS AND SO SCHOOLS ARE ARE THEN FORCED -- TO USE MORE OF THEIR FUNDING FOR FACILITIES RATHER THAN FOR FOR BASIC EDUCATION PROGRAM SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AT ME REVISION -- TO TO MAKE SURE ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS FULLY FUNDED -- AT AT THE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH IT IS THAT THE PROGRAM DOES PROVIDE A A COLA. ON THE GRANT RATES BUT THE COAL IS NOT NECESSARILY FUNDED AND LESS YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT IN THE BUDGET SO THERE'S ALL ALWAYS GOING TO BE THIS MISMATCH UNLESS WERE WERE KEEPING KEEPING UP WITH THE COLA. AS WELL AS GROWTH IN THE PROGRAMMER EACH YEAR TO APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU [inaudible] YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BONNIE BENSON AND I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH FOURTEEN SCHOOL OF EDUCATION I'M ALSO HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SUPPORTING AS THE SEVEN FORTY BEING FULLY FUNDED -- I BELIEVE YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR ME BUT I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS WHICH IS PARTY BROWN COLLEGE PREP LOCATED IN SAN BERNADINE NOW. AT HEARTY BROWN -- WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STUDENTS AND OUR MISSION WITH ALL OF OUR CHARTERS IN OUR NETWORK IS TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WRAPPED IN AMERICAN STUDENTS. AT HEARTY BROWN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 68% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. 25% FOR LATINO AND 90% OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED MEALS. OUR MODEL FOR FACILITIES HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO OPERATE IN THESE FACILITIES. IT ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE FOR LONG TERM FACILITIES WE ENTER INTO LONG TERM LEASES AND THAT WAY. WE AS EDUCATORS CAN SPEND OUR TIME FOCUSING ON ACADEMICS RATHER THAN ON NEGOTIATING FOR FACILITIES EACH YAR IN IT ALSO GIVES OUR FAMILY'S. STABILITY BECAUSE THEY KNOW YEAR AFTER YEAR WERE SCHOOLS GOING TO BE LOCATED -- OF COURSE WHEN WE NEGOTIATE HE'S LONG TERM LEASES OUR RANGE INCLUDES ESCALATION CLAUSES EACH YEAR SO FOR US -- SB SEVEN FORTY IS CRUCIAL AT THAT SCHOOL SITE. OUR PEACE COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND ARE SB -- SEVEN FORTY FUNDING IF IT WERE FULLY FUNDED WITH THE CALL ACT IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT COVERS ABOUT 57% OF OUR RENT THERE. WHICH IS HUGE THAT WOULD BE -- A LOT OF MONEY TO GET IT OUT OF OUR CLASSROOMS WE DIDN'T GET THAT MONEY. AND HAVING THAT WHOLE OFFENDED IS WHAT HELPS US KEEP UPWITH THE RIGHT ESCALATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY BUILT INTO OUR LONG TERM BASIS WHAT. WORKS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU FOR COMING WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON DAVE ALL RATS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST OUT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CAL STIRS FUNDING. I WE ALSO -- ALIGN OURSELVES WITH COMMENTS MADE BY JENNIFER BAKER CTA. REGARDING THE CONCERNS ON SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AFFECTING RETIREMENT SECURITY. ON THE HEALTH CARE TO DISCUSSION. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE A WE WANT TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT. THERE 70% OF THE RETIRED EDUCATORS WHO DO NOT HAVE. ANY SUPPORT FOR LIFETIME HEALTH BENEFITS FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. WHEN WE START DISCUSSION ON HOW WE LOOK AT? RETIREMENT SECURITY AND HEALTH CARE SECURITY [inaudible] THE AVERAGE. REPLACEMENT OF INCOME IS ABOUT ALL THE STUDIES SAY YOU NEED 85%. IF IT'S LESS THAN THAT AND YOU DO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE FUNDING. EVEN WORSE ALL. SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE WHEN YOU COME BACK THE SUBCOMMITTEE LOOKS AT THESE ISSUES AGAIN. WE CAN HAVE A MORE DISCUSSION ON WHAT ARE SOME OF THE INCENTIVES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED. FOR REDUCING BARRIERS. FOR POTENTIALLY HAVING SCHOOL DISTRICT BY INTO THE CALPERS. SYSTEM WHICH MAYBE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND PROVIDE DOWN THE ROAD BETTER FUNDING FOR RETIREE HEALTHCARE. HOW WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BY THE WAY DON'T WORRY THERE WERE NO PROPOSALS TO IMPACT? OR EFFECT TO RETIREE HEALTH CARE COMING OUT OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND WAS AN INFORMATIONAL ISSUE AT SOME COLLEAGUES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUTTHE WISE IN THE WHERE FOR IS WITH RESPECT. TO THOSE OF FEW DISTRICTS APPARENTLY THAT. THAT OFFER OF A POST RETIREMENT HEALTH BENEFITS -- OTHER THAN A MEDICARE -- SUPPLEMENT CONCEPT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE COST IN THE WISE AND THE WEATHER WHERE THE DISTRICTS WERE DISTRICTS THAT ARE UNDER. OF REVIEW OR MONITORING BUT REST EASY NOTHING COME OUT OF THIS ONE THANK YOU PRESSURE JOINING US. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT -- SEEING NONE I THINK WE'VE COVERED THE AGENDA AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE WILL BE
