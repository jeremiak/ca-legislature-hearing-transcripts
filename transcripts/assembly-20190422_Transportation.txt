GOVERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS AND FRANCHISE NEW CAR DEALERS TO BRING EQUITY TO THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP. THE NEW CAR DEALERS OPERATING AS LOCAL INDEPENDENTLY OWNED FRANCHISED DEALERSHIPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. CREATE JOBS. AND HELP SPUR LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEY'RE OFF TO THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AT A SPECIFIC CAR BRAND. THE OTHER INDUSTRY IN THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF AUTOMOBILE SALES WITH THAT SOME LIMITED EXCEPTIONS RELY ON THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM BETWEEN THE AUTOMAKERS AND DEALERS. THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN LARGE MANUFACTURE. LARGE MOST MULTINATIONAL AUTO MAKERS AND CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERS IS FAIR AND PROVIDES A COMPETITIVE PLAYING FIELD. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR HIS EFFORTS TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE TO BRING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE NEGOTIATION TABLE. AFTER TWO ROBUST MEETINGS LAST WEEK BETWEEN THE SPONSORS OPPONENTS AND OUR RESPECTIVE STAFFS WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE AGREED TO REMOVE THE WISCONSIN WARRANTY FORMULA. APPROACH CURRENTLY IN THE BILL AND ESTABLISH AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS THAT WILL WORK FOR BOTH DEALERS AND AUTOMATE AUTOMAKERS. REMOVING THIS FORMULA IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCESSION. BUT WE BELIEVE. IT IS ONE THAT WILL PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN AS WE ESTABLISH A TRANSPARENT AND EQUITABLE PROCESS TO DETERMINE WARRANTY REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FOR THE MORE AUTOMAKERS HAVE REQUESTED A ROOM A MECHANISM TO VERIFY THE RETAIL. REBATES SUBMITTED BY DEALERS AND WE ARE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION.

THE CAR MORE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO REPLACE OUTDATED DIESEL ENGINES WITH CLEANER DIESEL ENGINES IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A NET REDUCTION IN DIESEL EMISSIONS. INSTEAD THIS REPLACEMENT WOULD INCREASE DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER TPM. AND THE CAR MORE PROGRAM HAS NEVER BEEN USED TO REPLACE GAS WITH DIESEL THIS GOES AGAINST CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES.

ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. THE CELLS WHICH LIKE KLAS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER ONE TIMES PER PREDICAMENTS CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CELL SERVICE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE A VOTE -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR [inaudible] TO FIVE SIXTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES FOR CONSIDERING AB FIVE SIXTEEN A BILL THAT WOULD REFORM A HANDFUL OF HARMFUL TELLING PRACTICES. THAT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WE ALL KNOW TOWING TO BE A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE BUT FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. IT'S HAD A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT. LET ME SAY THE OUTSIDE THEIR MANY GOOD REASONS WHY CAR SHOULD BE TOWED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC FLOW. IN FACT WE DO NOT IN THIS BILL TOUCH TWO DOZEN LEGAL GROUNDS TO TOW CARS. BUT THERE ARE THREE TOWING GROUNDS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY -- TRAFFIC THAT DO PENALIZE YOU FOR MINOR OFFENSES BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOME AS WELL DOCUMENTED WAS STATE WIDE DATA. THAT WE REFER TO AS POVERTY TOES TOES WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE PARKING TICKETS OUTDATED CAR REGISTRATION SUPPORT LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS WHEN YOUR CAR'S BEEN LEGALLY PARKED FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS ON A PUBLIC STREET. THE HEART OF THIS BILL IS THAT USING TOàN AS A MINOR DEBT COLLECTION TOOL HAS NOT ONLY BEEN INEFFECTIVE BUT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ANY BECAUSE OF POVERTY. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY YOUR PARKING TICKETS OR CAR REGISTRATION YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE AVERAGE FEE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET YOUR CAR FROM A TOW YARD OR ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN YOU ADD DALY STORAGE. PARKING TICKETS AND ADDITIONAL FEES AND FINES. ALMOST HALF OF ALL AMERICANS LACK SAVINGS TO COVER AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND IF YOU CAN'T GET YOUR CAR OUT OF A TOW YARD WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IT'S SOLD ADALINE CELL. GETTING TOWED MEANS THAT YOU PERMANENTLY LOSE YOUR CAR YOU CAN'T GET TO YOUR JOB YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T PAY THE MINOR DEBT THERE WAS A REASON FOR THE TELL. IT'S HARDER TO GO TO SCHOOL DEFENSE TO HANDLE FAMILY OBLIGATIONS TO MOVE OFF OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. AND A TOW CAN OFTEN MEAN YOU LOSE THE ONLY SHELTER YOU MAY HAVE OF THE CAR. AND CAR OWNERS NOT THE ONLY PARTY WHO LOSES UNDER THIS POLICY. TOTAL YARDS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSIVE STORE IN A CAR FOR THIRTY DAYS BEFORE SELLING IT IN A LIEN SALE. AND THE COST OF STORAGE AND CAR SALES TYPICALLY EXCEED THE LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THE CAR. CITIES AT RUN TELLING PROGRAMS LOSE MONEY FOR THE SAME REASON TYPICALLY LOSING OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR PER CAR TOWED. WHEN GOVERNMENT TOE SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR IT CREATES A CYCLE POVERTY THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT ANYONE? LOW INCOME PEOPLE LOSE TOTAL YARDS LOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOSE THIS BILL WOULD HOPEFULLY STOP A CYCLE THAT IS NOT WORKING. AT THIS TIME LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES INCLUDING MERRY LOVELESS WHO IS REPRESENTING ONE OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF POVERTY RELATED TO US. AS WELL AS A LISA TELAH KIANA WITH THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE ON CIVIL RIGHTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAIR -- AT MS LOVELACE HAS DIRECT EXPERIENCE SHE MY NAME IS MERRY LOVELESS I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT TOàN LAWS. WHICH IT HAD THE DEVASTATING IMPACT IMPACTS ON MY LIFE AROUND TWO THOUSAND NINE DURING THE RECESSION I WAS WORKING AS A HOME IMPROVEMENT SPECIALIST. I RELIED ON MY VEHICLE TO CARRY SAMPLES OF MATERIALS INCLUDING HARDWARE WINDOWS AND DOORS TO MY CLIENTS HOMES. MY VEHICLE WAS A BEAUTIFULLY RESTORED FORD OR NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO LINCOLN TOWN CAR. FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS BEGAN AS A THE ECONOMY WENT SOUTH AND I WAS LAID OFF FROM MY JOB. I LIVED IN A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME WITH A THREE BEDROOM. IN BRENTWOOD CALIFORNIA BUT I WAS EVICTED DUE TO THE INABILITY TO PAY MY RENT. I HAD A NICE HOME IN LIFE AND THEN I DIDN'T. STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE ULTIMATELY I RAN OUT OF OPTIONS. AN EXPERIENCE INSURMOUNTABLE HARDSHIPS. I WASN'T ABLE TO SCRAPE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY MY BILL SUPPORT AS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS RAN OUT I COULD NOT AFFORD BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS GASOLINE. AND MY CAR FOR MY CAR AND UTILITIES I BEGAN RECEIVING PARKING TICKETS. FOR STREET SWEEPING WHEN I MOVED BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO. THERE WOULDBE A MANY OF THEM WERE NOT LEGITIMATE BECAUSE MY CAR WAS PARKED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET. WITH THE SIGNS WERE POSTED IN COMPLAINING TO THE CITY IT WAS MY WORD AGAINST THE MEDIA MAN'S AND FORTUNATELY I COULD NOT PROVE -- NOR. AFFORD THESE TICKETS THE PAYMENT PLAN WAS NOT AN OPTION ULTIMATELY THE CITY BOOTED AND TOLD MY CAR. CHARGING APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO RETRIEVE IT I TRIED TO CONTEST THE SF MTM DENIED BY MY REQUEST FOR AN APPEAL AND MY CAR WAS SOLD AT AUCTION FOR A HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. THEY FILED A LIEN AGAINST ME FOR ENTIRE AMOUNT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS DAMAGING MY CREDIT. THE CITY IN TOW COMPANY COST SEVERAL TRAUMAS IN MY LIFE AND IT WAS IN. POSSIBLE FINDING A HOME. IMPROVEMENT DESIGN JOB WITHOUT A CAR. LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS AS I WAS UP AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS I COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY EVEN BUS FARE. AND THE BANKRUPTCY ENSUED. I LOST MY DRIVER'S LICENSE AND I AM WITHOUT A CAR TO THIS DAY. THIS EXPERIENCE STRIPPED ME OF MY CAR THREATEN TO ROB ME OF MY DIGNITY AND I WAS DEMORALIZED DEPRESSED AND HAD NO TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS I COULDN'T FIX ANYTHING INFILL TOPLESS. I BECAME PARALYZED BY SYSTEM THAT IS SET UP TO MAKE POOR PEOPLE FAIL. MY HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE CANNOT BE EASILY SUMMARIZED BUT I SINCERELY HOPE YOU CONSIDER VOTING TO APPROVE AB FIVE ONE SIX SO THAT OTHER VULNERABLE LOW INCOME PEOPLE DO NOT SUFFER THE PAINFUL SITUATION I EXPERIENCED. AND ARE EMPOWERED TO OVERCOME THE NEGATIVE DOMINO EFFECT POVERTY. ALSO KNOWN AS THE REMAINDER OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS THANK YOU AT WE HAVE NEW DATA ON THIS THESE POVERTY TOES ARE DEVASTATING THERE ARE ALSO NOT A WIN FOR ANYONE THE COST THE CITY MONEY THESE ARE LOW VALUE VEHICLES. AND JUST ONE NUMBER I'LL SHARE WITHYOU AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- FOR THE FIRST STEP FOR SEVENTY TWO HOUR TOES AND THAT MEANS THAT THE CITY'S COST IS MORE THAN TRIPLE -- THE VALUE OF THE CAR AT AUCTION AT AND THE TOW COMPANIES HAVE TO STORE LOW VALUE CARS IN THEIR LOTS AND ALL THE SAME TIME PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR VEHICLES AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YEAR I'VE OF THE Q..

ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE -- OPPOSITION THE AUTHORS BILL WOULD LIKE TO SHARE CONCERNS. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. THIS HOW YOUR CURRENT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- TO QUITE A WEEK CONSIDER OTHER BUS TECHNOLOGIES YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE TECHNOLOGY -- LEAVE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE STATE AIR QUALITY IN CLIMACOOL SAY THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE THAT DIRECTION. FOR MEETING THE CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE STANDARDS AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS WE SEE THAT ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES ARE -- A PLACE WHERE CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER AND SHOULD BE LEADER TO MEET THESE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S A VIPER AND ZERO MISSION BUS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. SO ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. I ALSO A SUPPORT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT MARKETS TO CREATE A BENEFICIAL REUSE FOR URBAN IN OR RURAL ORGANIC WASTE INCLUDING CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FEELS LIKE ORANGEY. MY CONCERN THAT THIS BILL SIX WINNERS OVER LOSERS OR VICE VERSA. AND PARTICULAR IN THIS MARKET AND I WANT YOU TO SOMETIMES THINK OUTSIDE THE URBAN AREA -- ARE RURAL AREAS MAY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY GETTING ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SOME BUSES IN THE LA AREA. ARE SITTING IDLE RIGHT NOW THE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT QUITE THERE AND THAT'S A BIG INVESTMENT THE PEOPLE ARE MAKING. I'M ALSO FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO YOU TO BE AWARE THAT WHEN IT COMES THE FLOOR I MIGHT HAVE. A DIFFERENT -- VOTE FOR YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THESE CONCERNS. CERTAINLY INFRASTRUCTURE -- OF HOW WE GET POWER TO THE BUSES IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF UTILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AND HOW WE BUILD OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE -- PART OF THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TO SAY IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE IF WE ARE ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN ZERO EMISSION. WORLD -- PARTICULARLY IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE OR PARTS THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS AT THIS POINT HOW DO WE DO THAT SO -- HOPEFULLY TO THIS BILL WILL BE ABLE TO TO TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS PUSH TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE ACHIEVE THAT.

PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER HAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU AB. SEVEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES A CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CERTIFY THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE FREE FROM THE USE OF CHILD LABOR. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO SUSPENDED THAT MANDATE UNTIL CARD CAN CERTIFY THAT THIS VEHICLES MEET THE CHILD LABOR FREE STANDARD. ZEBRA CHELATION TO REQUIRE ARMENIAN FACTORIES TO OFFER FOR SALE SPECIFIC NUMBERS OF THE VERY CLEAN IS CARDS AVAILABLE SUCH AS FULL BATTERY -- ELECTRIC HYDROGEN FUEL CELL IN PLUG IN ELECTRIC HYBRID VEHICLES. CAL CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC CAR FLEET ON THE RED WAY TODAY'S OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WITH BATTERIES BUILT ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE POOR. THE SINGLE LINK IN THE ELECTRIC CAR REVOLUTION IS THE MINERAL COBALT. COBALT IS PRESENT IN EVERY LITHIUM ION RECHARGEABLE BATTERY ON THE PLANET FROM SMARTPHONES TO TABLETS TO LAPTOPS OBVIOUSLY. BATTERIES IN IN VEHICLES COUPLE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE RAW MATERIAL INSIDE A LITHIUM ION BATTERY AND WORLDWIDE DEMAND FROM THE BATTERY SECTOR HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SO ANYWHERE FROM 6270%. OF THE WORLD'S COBALT COMES FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND LOCALS MANY AMONG THEM CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS SIX YEARS OLD OUR TASK TO MIND THIS MINERAL IN OFTEN HARSH CONDITIONS. THEY ALSO PRODUCE ABOUT 25% OF THE WORLD'S COBALT -- MANY TIMES IN AND CONDITIONS YOU YOU COULD NOT IMAGINE. AND THAT HAPPENS WITH REGULARITY MONTHS -- WE HAD THIRTEEN MINERS DIED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FIFTEEN MORE DIED AFTER THAT IN CALL WAYS TO UNICEF ESTIMATED WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY -- THEY ESTIMATE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND WORK JUST IN ONE PARTICULAR SIDE -- ALONE IN IN THE CONGO SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KIDS -- REALLY ARE WORKING IN THIS INDUSTRY WE JUST KNOW THAT THEY ARE -- THE STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT RESIDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR MINE TIED URINARY CONCENTRATIONS OF COAL BUT THERE WERE FORTY THREE TIMES HIGHER. LEAD LEVELS FIVE TIMES HIGHER CADMIUM AND URANIUM LEVELS. FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL GROUP -- WE HAVE A THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO MAKE HEADWAY IN THIS AREA APPLE IS CERTAINLY -- HAVING A GOT A GOOD AMOUNT OF SUCCESS -- AMAZON AS WELL TESLA. BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN DO MORE SO -- I KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAS HAS GIVEN SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- SOME CONCERN AND WONDERING WHAT TO DO WITH THIS BUT I WILL. I WILL ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A MANDATE. RATE WE WE HAVE A CERTAIN I MEAN THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF JOBS WE HAVE TO PUT ON THE ROAD. AND CALIFORNIA'S THE LEADER IN THIS TYPE OF GREEN AND YOUR LEAST TRYING TO LEAD THE WAY OF ALL THE OTHER STATES. WHICH IS GREAT BUT WE CANNOT DO THAT ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN. IN THE CONGO BECAUSE WE WANT TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT OURSELVES. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE GREEN IF WE'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDLY TO THE EARTH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE FRIENDLY TO HUMANS AS WELL AND JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A WORLD AWAY. DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T BEAR SOME SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING THIS BILL TODAY. ON STEIN WHO IS THE FOUNDER AN AMBASSADOR FOR ENERGY IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN FOR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS. INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT CARD ON THE ENERGY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA IS HERE I TO TESTIFY TODAY BEFORE YOU AND WITH -- WITHOUT RUN GO AHEAD. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT YOU RUN ON THE CLOCK FOR TWO MINUTES. THERE ARE NO KNOWN CLEAN SUPPLY CHAIN FOR LITHIUM COBALT. YET THE RICHEST MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES OF WORLD IS STILL MAKING NUMEROUS CREATIVE AND COMPLEX EXCUSES FOR NOT INVESTIGATING. THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS AND HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR TWENTY YEARS. IT'S NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR A FOR A FOR PROFIT COMPANY TO TURN DOWN A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT COMES TIME TO BUYING RAW MATERIALS IN A CROWDED MARKETPLACE? THAT'S WHAT'S MOST LARGE I'M TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME OF BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES. DON'T REALLY DO THE RESEARCH THEY SHOULD ON COMPANIES WITH PRICES ARE SO GOOD. I'M BOB AND HEROES THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. THE TURN A BLIND EYE THE REALITIES OF THE DIRTY SECRETS OF LITHIUM COBALT ACQUISITION AND PROCUREMENT SIDE. IS THE MAN FOR RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES GROWS COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVE THEY HAVE AN ETHICAL SUPPLY CHAIN. A PRIORITY WHEN IMPLEMENTING GREEN POLICIES AND NOT PROFITING FROM THE MISERY OF MINERS WORKING IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. LIKE CLOTHES AND SHOES AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE ENERGY SOLUTIONS OF THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE BUILT ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. BY NOT HOLDING MAJOR AUTOMAKERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRITY. BY THE CALIFORNIA TRANSFERENCE SUPPLY CHAIN LAW ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. WELL BUILDING THOSE COVERS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ARE INVERSELY PROMOTING AND SANCTIONING THESE CRIMES. THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAINTED IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THAT. ABSENT PUBLIC AVAILABLE DISCLOSURES CONSUMERS OR DISADVANTAGE IN BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ETHICAL COMPANIES. ON THE MERITS OF THEIR EFFORTS DESPITE PRODUCTS FREE FROM THE STENCH OF SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE FEEDING A. B.. SEVEN THIRTY FIVE WOULD BE YOUR WAY OF EXEMPTING AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS. FROM THE LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA FOR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY IN OF THE FEDERAL. FOR BUSINESS SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY IT WOULD ENCOURAGE CONTINUED EXPLOITATION OF HORRENDOUS LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. OUR MANUFACTURERS LAST ASKING WRAP IT UP PLEASE. YOUR TO PASSING WE ENCOURAGE PASSING AB SEVEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH AND A STRONG MESSAGE TO THOSE COMPANIES TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT TO HEAR TO LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. TO ENSURE THAT HE THESE HAVE CLEAN BATTERIES. THANK YOU. SO FIRST BY MR FUNG SECOND BY MISTER BIGELOW -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION OF THE AUTHORS BILL. I'LL REMIND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THE MIX. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS KATHERINE GARCIA AND POLICY ADVOCATE FOR SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVEN THESE ARE NOT JUST TO HAVE PEOPLE MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES -- WE HAVE TWELVE YEARS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OR RISK CLIMATE CHANGE CATASTROPHE. AND TODAY IS EARTH DAY SO I ASK YOU TO VOTE. OF WITH THIS IN MIND -- REGARDING EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY FIVE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA URGES ASSEMBLY MELENDEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELINDA'S KATHY. TO EXPAND THE SCOPE AND AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE ALL VEHICLES NO VEHICLE OF ANY KIND SHOULD BE USING MATERIALS ACQUIRED THROUGH CHILD LABOR. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM CHILD EXPLOITATION. THE TERROR TO OWNS A WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL NGO HAS REPORTED THAT MIKE A MINING WHICH IS A MINERAL USE FOR HIMMERY CARPETS AND PARTS ACROSS. ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS IT'S CARRIED OUT BY CHILDREN IN INDIA MADAGASCAR CHINA SRI LANKA PAKISTAN AND BRAZIL. SIERRA CLUB ASKS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ ALSO EMIT THE SECTION ABOUT AMENDING THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND RE SUBMITTING TO THE US EPA. THIS WAS LIKELY TO LAY PROGRESS ON EMISSION REDUCTIONS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS. I'M IN THE UNIQUE POSITION OF GETTING TO THE SAME PLACE BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAN THAN MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SIERRA CLUB. WE'RE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- IN NO WAY DO WE WANT TO DIMINISH THE THE ISSUE THAT THE AUTHORS RAISING HERE WE DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. AND AND WHETHER IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR ANY OF OUR VEHICLES WE ALWAYS STRIVE TO DO THE BEST TO TO PROVE UP OUR SUPPLY CHAINS AS BEST WE CAN RECOGNIZING THAT. AT TIMES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR SUPPLIES OF MATERIALS THAT ARE. EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS AND RE MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS AND AND ASSEMBLERS AWAY FROM WHEN WE ACTUALLY INCORPORATE THAT COMPONENT INTO THE VEHICLE -- YES OUR OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTION TO THE BILL TODAY IS YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. THAT THE SAID MANDATE SHOULD BE HELD HOSTAGE OVER. AND AND THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT DESERVE MANDATE IS AND WHAT THE BILL DOES -- YOU KNOW THE SAID MANDATE ON ON MY MEMBERS ON EACH AUTO MAKER IN IN THAT. HEARING CALIFORNIA IS AN ANNUAL MANDATE. THE BILL REQUIRES A RB TO GO OUT AND TO CONDUCT THIS CERTIFICATION IN SIX MONTHS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE SIX MONTH FREEZE IF YOU WILL IS ON THIS HAVE MANDATE GIVEN THAT IT'S AN ANNUAL MANDATE -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A START STOP THAT I THINK IS DIFFICULT FOR MEMBERS TO TO FIGURE OUT. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK HAS NO PRACTICAL FACT ON ON THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT MANDATE AND AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THAT OUR COMPANIES MEET THAT MANDATE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FOR THESE REASONS WERE POSTED THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. MR RISEN. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR -- FOR THE CONCERN YOU HAVE FOR CHILDREN -- AROUND THE WORLD ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE BEING EXPLOITED TO DO WORK THAT IS. A DANGER TO THEIR HEALTH -- JUST IT CAUGHT MY EAR WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. ARE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES THE ONLY. FOR IS. A LIVE VIA MY OUT I ON BATTERIES ONLY HOUSTON'S THEIR VEHICLES. OR ARE THOSE BATTERIES USED AND OTHER ITEMS THAT. YEAH -- USED IN ALL KINDS OF SOCIAL MEDIA DEVICES AS WELL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SOCIAL MEDIA DEVICE IPADS IPHONES? OKAY SO. IF THEY'RE USED ON IPADS AND IPHONES IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY AS AN AUTHOR YOU CHOSE TO SPECIFICALLY. POINT OUT JUST VEHICLES WHEN PROBABLY YOU COULD TAKE ALL THE BATTERIES AND LAPTOPS. AND IT WOULD WASTE -- PAST -- USE AS FAR AS THE VEHICLES GOING YES -- FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRODUCTS TO HAVE THIS MATERIAL IN THEM -- WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD TODAY IN ONE BILL SO IT'S ALWAYS I MEAN I GUESS IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE THAT WE HAD SOME OPPOSITION THAT SAID WELL. IF THE BILL INCLUDED EVERYTHING. THEN WE COULD SUPPORT IT. THAT'S NONSENSE SURE OKAY AND YES THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PRODUCTS OUT THERE HAVE IT WE STARTED WITH THIS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A MANDATE THAT WE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE WITH THIS TYPE OF BATTERY. WHICH CARRIES POUNDS LIKE TWENTY TO THIRTY POUNDS OF THIS MATERIAL AS OPPOSED TO HOW MUCH YOU TALK IN GRAHAM'S OF THIS MATERIAL IN AN IPHONE OR AN IPAD. HERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE OKAY THANKS. THE BIG DIFFERENCES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. MS MELENDEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT SO MANY MEMBERS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT THIS MANDATE IN CALIFORNIA TO GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE CARS ON THE ROAD THAT IS. IT THAT'S THAT'S HOW CALIFORNIANS CHOSEN TO LEAVE BUT I AGAIN I WILL SAY TO YOU THAT. THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THE CALIFORNIA CAN THÅU ITSELF IS THE LEADER. IN IN HUMAN RIGHTS THE LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS A LEADER IN ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE VIRTUOUS. BY THE STANDARDS OF CALIFORNIANS HOW DO WE DO THAT WHEN THEY'RE WAY WE'RE GETTING THERE. IS BY PUTTING KIDS THAT ARE SIX YEARS OLD IN THE MINDS DIGGING WITH THE SHOVEL WHO ARE BAREFOOT. THIS THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON ZEDD'S. IT'S NOT A I MEAN WE HAVE THEM AND CALIFORNIA'S 50% OF THEM IN IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE MUCH TRYING TO ATTACK THESE CAR WHAT I'M SAYING IS. WE'RE GONNA WALK THE WALK WAY TO TALK THE TALK. THAT'S WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- IS MELENDEZ -- I'LL BE. NUMBER IN YOUR BILL TODAY. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HOLD CAR MANUFACTURERS. ACCOUNTABLE ENSURE ALL CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER THIS BILLS TO ME IS THE WRONG APPROACH. I BELIEVE THIS BILL DOES. NOTHING TO ACTUALLY PROTECT CHILDREN. AB SEVEN THIRTY FIVE ONLY FOCUSES ON A VERY SPECIFIC INDUSTRY IN COMMODITY -- ONE OF THE THINGS IF YOU'RE A TRULY CONCERNED WITH CHILD LABOR I INVITE YOU TO THINK OF THIS MATTER HOLISTICALLY. AND SUBSTANCE SUBSTANTIVELY. SIR JUST SINGLE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ANY TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE FOR YOU CAN GET A REPORT THAT WAS DUE. IN DECEMBER.

AT THE END THE JUSTIFICATIONS BEING MADE THAT THERE'S NO DEMAND FOR THESE VEHICLES HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT'S AN ACCURATE THE CURRENT WEIGHTLESS FOR THESE VEHICLES IS AROUND SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH MEANS THAT FEES HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. OF TRYING TO ACCESS THESE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON HOLD. THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS FIELD GOAL COALITION IS A MEMBER OF THE A. R. FPTP ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE'VE ENGAGE WITH C. C. COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEETINGS. AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE RESOLUTION ON THESE ISSUES TODAY THERE'S NO PLAN PRESENTED FOR HOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION OR STAFF WILL ADDRESS THIS WAIT LIST AND FUN THIS WAIT LIST AND DEVELOP A PLAN -- FOR NOW UNTIL WHEN THE END OF THE PROGRAM EXPIRES AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO WE JUST URGE YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO NOW FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IN AREAS WHERE THERE AREN'T THE REDUCTIONS. NATURAL GAS VEHICLES RUNNING ON RENEWABLE FUELS ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO PROVIDE RELIEF AND THE ONLY OTHER OPTION WE'RE PROVIDING IS KEEPING THE STATUS QUO OF DIRTY POLLUTED TRUCKS THANK YOU. SO JUST FOR THE RECORD SIR CAN I GET YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT OUT PART OF THE GERMAN MY NAME'S JOSIAH YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLES COALITION I THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. I SURVEYS REMEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I'M RYAN KENNYWOOD CLEAN ENERGY JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME LIKE MAKE ONE MAJOR POINT -- BACK IN DECEMBER THE ELLIE -- RELEASED A REPORT ON TRANSPORTATION AND THEY FOUND THAT TRANSPORTATION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PROGRAMS HAVE NOT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVERALL IN A RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE IT ALSO FOUND THAT THE ONLY REDUCTION. IN TRANSPORTATION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS IN THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IN THE CLEAN -- TRUCKS ACTOR ARE LOW -- KNOCKS AT VEHICLES WITH RENEWABLE FUEL SO WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM WILL GET MORE THOSE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD WE URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. FOR THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME THE REPRESENTING PLEASE A CHAIRMAN IF I MAY ALSO WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. MA'AM.

SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA OPPOSES AB FORTINO SIX WHICH WOULD INVEST IN BIO FUELS PRODUCTION AND ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S AFFECTS EFFORTS TOWARDS ZERO MISSION TRANSPORTATION FUTURE BIO FUELS GENERALLY ARE NOT EMISSIONS FREE AND THEIR USE IN COMBUSTION ENGINES CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE AND LOCALIZED AIR POLLUTION. A COMMITMENT TO BIO FUELS AND ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES WOULD HINDER CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR GOALS AND THE STATE SHOULD NOT INVEST IN STOP GAP MEASURES.

DESPITE HAVING AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. ADMIRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD EMISSIONS FROM CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. ARE ON THE RISE. ONE OF THE KEY OBSTACLES TO REDUCING TRANSPORTATION RELATED EMISSIONS IS DEMONSTRATING. TO VEHICLE OWNERS THAT FUELING CAPACITY EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES. ADDITIONALLY. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICATED COURSE OF FUNDING FOR LOW CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT. OF THE STRATEGY TO DE CARBONIZED ARE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND WITH ME HERE TOUCH. TO TESTIFY TODAY IS -- IS -- ALONE LOOKING FOR THE REBEKAH BORDEAUX -- FROM OVER ON FUELS AND JAKE DONAHUE ON BEHALF OF HYDROGEN SHARE -- STAKEHOLDERS. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENT PLEASE I HAMMER BACK AT THE JOB PRESIDENT OVER ON FEELS I'M TRAINED AS A PC CAM AS IN FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE HAVE WORKED WITH EARLY STAGE COMPANIES. AB SEVEN FIFTY THREE IS ABOUT SUPPORTING PROMISE PROMISING AND EVADE OF AN EMERGING FUELS THAT CAN BE MADE FROM HARMFUL MISSION SUCH AS METHANE FROM DAIRY FARMS. THAT CAN BE MADE FROM PROBLEMATIC FEEDSTOCKS SUCH AS WOOD WASTE. THAT CAN MAKE ULTRA LOW CARBON OR CARBON NEGATIVE FUELS AND HELP CALIFORNIA REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY. AS AS WELL AS FUEL SECOND POWERS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND HELP THE STATE REACHES ZERO EMISSION GOALS. O'BRIEN IS A CALIFORNIA MAY COMPANY THAT FOCUSES ON CONVERTING WASTE STREAM CITY IN ME A CLEAN BURNING DESIRE PLACEMENT AND THE CARRIER FOR RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. OVER THE PAST EIGHT AND HALF YEARS OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE FUNDING HAS BEEN INVESTED IN -- RUN WITH ZERO GRANT FUNDING FROM CALIFORNIA IN ZERO FEDERAL FUNDING ONLY RECENTLY WAS -- RON NOTIFIED OF THE PAINTING GRANT AWARD FROM THE CC BUT IT WAS EIGHT YEARS IN THE MAKING.

BUT WITH ALL THIS PROGRESS HOWEVER WE'RE STILL NOT AT THE POINT OF COMMERCIALIZATION NOT THROUGH THE VALLEY OF DEATH. IN CLOSING THREE REASONS THIS BILL AS IMPORTANT AS ABOUT CALIFORNIA MAY FUELS AND INNOVATION OVER HAS ONE COMPANY AMONG MANY IN THIS SPACE. IT HELPS SOUGHT SUPPORT INNOVATION THAT CAN SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S FEED STOCK AND A MISSION CHALLENGES WHILE CREATING LOCAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. NUMBER TWO MANY'S PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA REACHES EMISSIONS GOALS WILL DIE ON THE VINE THE STATE DOES NOT SUPPORT. BRIDGING THE VALLEY OF DEATH AND HELP THESE FUELS LAUNCH INTO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. MOST COMPANIES ARE NOT AS FORTUNATE AS US VENTURE COMPOSITION IS DOWN LONG AGO AND THIS PURPOSE BILL PROVIDES AN AVENUE TO SUPPORT INNOVATION. AND FINALLY NUMBER THREE THIS BILL PAVES THE WAY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF GREAT MOLECULES WHILE RENEWABLE DME HYDROGEN AND RENEWABLE PROPANE OR INNOVATIVE FUELS I WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. WE WANTED WE NONE OF US WANT TO BE INNOVATIVE FOREVER WE WANT TO REACH COMMERCIALIZATION AND KEEP COULDN'T SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE. TO WRAP IT UP.

SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA POSES AB SEVEN FIFTY THREE IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS ENERGY AND CLIMATE TARGETS WE NEED TO TRANSITION TO ZERO CARBON RESOURCES. HOWEVER. AB SEVEN FIFTY THREE WILL ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN LOW CARBON ENERGY RESOURCES THAT ARE DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION CAN RESULT IN GHG EMISSIONS. WHEN IT IS CREATED FROM FACT GAS METHANE GAS OR MADE USING AN ELECTRONIC? ELECTOR LIKE. GIVE ME PROCESS IS POWERED BY FOSSIL FUELS. AB SEVEN FIFTY THREE WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF BY A METHANE WHICH COULD EXPAND POLLUTING DAIRY FARMS AND COSTLY AND INEFFECTIVE BIOTECH JESTERS. THIS BILL COULD DELAY OUR TRANSITION TO TRULY CLEAN RENEWABLE RESOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND BY INAPPROPRIATELY INCENTIVIZE IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF POLLUTING ENERGY RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

PLEASE STEP FORWARD. CAN YOU PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU'RE REPRESENTING FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL TODAY -- YOU KNOW IT IS I LOOK AT THE BILL AYE AYE I FIND IT'S HELPFUL TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE END OF THE BILL AND WORKED MY WAY BACKWARDS. AND WHAT THE WHAT THE BILL ENDS WITH I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS ESSENTIALLY WAY TO BACK US INTO A MANDATE OF FIVE MILLIONS ADS ON CALIFORNIA ROADS. BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS CERTAINLY A LAUDABLE GOAL BUT TO MANDATE THAT IN THE LAW WE THINK IS PROBLEMATIC. WHY DO I THINK IT'S A MANDATE THE END OF THE BILL THE STATE BOARD SHALL ADOPT CRITERIA AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS? TO ENSURE THE REBATE LEVELS CAN BE PHASE DOWN. IN INCREMENTS BASED ON CUMULATIVE SALES LEVELS. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE THE REBATE SHALL BE FAILURES DOWN IT SAYS THAT OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER CREDIT CRITERIA SHALL BE ADOPTED. TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PHASE THOSE THINGS DOWN. SO WHAT ARE WE ADOPTING AND NEW CRITERIA BEING PUT INTO PLACE SO THAT REBATES COULD BE PHASED OUT WHAT IS THE BILL. ASKING THEY ARE BE TO LOOK AT AND WE LOOK THROUGH AND WE SEE MARKETING EFFORTS BY AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WE SEE DIFFERENT. DIFFERENTIAL PRICING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES PURSES INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT. INCLUDING. A MANDATE OF WHAT DOES THE REBATE NEED TO BE AT WITH THESE OTHER CRITERIA TO GET US TO FIVE MILLION. JOBS ON THE ROAD AND THEN IT STARTS WITH CODIFYING THAT IN STATUTE. THAT'S VERY CONCERNING TO US -- CERTAINLY THESE ARE LAUDABLE GOALS AS IS BEEN REPORTED CALIFORNIA HAS THE VAST MAJORITY OF STEPS ON THE ROAD MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE -- COMBINED AND AND THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO GET THERE AND GET MORE RESERVES ON THE ROAD BUT MANDATES [inaudible] IN LAW. LACK OF AMBITION IS NOT OUR PROBLEM. TOO MANY INCENTIVES IS NOT OUR PROBLEM THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO INVESTORS WHICH YOU TO PLEASE INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS WE THINK ARE MORE HELPFUL FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN HERE REPRESENTING PLEASE. YES OVER THORN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EVEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO IMPOSE THE FIVE MILLION SEVENTH. WE PREFER TO SEE AN TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL MANDATE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. QUICK READ IT SO QUESTIONS THIS IS EXCLUDE HYBRIDS -- DOESN'T EXPERT HARPER'S. THANK YOU. SO I DO HAVE A FIRST -- WITH MISTER GIBSON I'M. ENTERTAIN MOTION FOR SECOND. SO MISTER BERMAN'S OUR SECOND -- MISTER TING REJECT. THE AGAIN THE THE BILL DOES NOT HAVE A MANDATE THE FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL WAS -- PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUES LAST YEAR JUST TRY TO RESTATE THAT GOAL -- IN ADDITION IT IS -- NOT -- IT IS DEFINITELY TECHNOLOGY NEW TOOLS ON THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT HAVE ANY EMISSIONS -- IN IN ADDITION WE'VE ALREADY PASSED -- VERY STRINGENT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS -- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IN ORDER TO REACH THOSE PROGRESSIVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GREATLY REDUCE THE EMISSIONS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH ACCOUNTS 440% OF THAT EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION THIS IS OUR MONEY TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR INCENTIVE REBATE PROGRAM -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES ARE THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE GOTTEN A HUGE SUBSIDIES -- ABOUT FOR THE STATE SO THAT OUR CONSUMERS CALIFORNIA'S WILL GO BY THEIR CARS SO. AGAIN THE I THINK THIS IS A A GOOD. SIMPLE BILL ASKING THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE REBATE PROGRAM. AGAIN THANK YOU THANKS THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN JUST RESPECT AS RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER KING OF NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCTION GOALS WITH THE VEHICLES. BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WELL FIRE DAMAGE IS DONE EVERY YEAR -- GOING FORWARD ALSO IS A BIG FACTOR THAT SETS US BACK EVERY TIME -- WITH THE WE TRY TO MAKE GAINS AND ALSO IN WE HAVE WELFARE SO SUSPECTED LEASE -- ZERO AS YOU KNOW I STRUGGLE THE FACT THAT A OR B. DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING EXISTING LAWS. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. ON THIS ISSUE -- LOBBYIST FOR YOUR BILL TODAY -- MADAM SECRETARY WELL WE DO HAVE THE FIRST.

TWELVE SIXTY SIX ONE STEP UP AND WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO SIR. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNIY TO SPEAK ON ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWELVE SIXTY SIX WHICH PROMOTES BIKE SAFETY AND GUIDANCE ON OUR ROADS IN INTO CERTAINLY FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS. A IT WAS -- YOU KNOW A GOOD ANALYSIS I THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE AMENDMENTS ALL HAPPY TO ACCEPT THEM AS A YOU'LL SEE ARE SHOWN IN PRINT. I NOW THIS BILL AIMS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM -- SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR CYCLISTS IN FOR OUR LOCAL AGENCIES. AND SO I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT VEHICLE INTERSECTIONS POSE A SAFETY RISKS FOR BOTH DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS -- AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHEN A BIKE LANE ENDS ABRUPTLY. UPON MERGING WITH A RIGHT TURN LANE. AND SO THAT'S WHY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS. A RECOMMENDS CREATING SHARED BIKE AND RIGHT TURN LANES LANES THAT DIRECT DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS ON SAFE PATHS THROUGH INTERSECTIONS -- AND THIS SHARED LÏNG CONCEPT IT GUIDES OR AT LEAST IT WILL GUIDE -- ARE CYCLE IS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERSECTION IN THE FAR LEFT PORTION OF THE TURN LANE. WELL CARS ARE PROVIDED SPACE TO SAFELY TURN RIGHT -- THUS AVOIDING POTENTIAL VEHICLE TO PEDESTRIAN COLLISIONS -- AND YOU CAN SEE AN ILLUSTRATION IN IN THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I THINK THEY DID A GOOD JOB -- IN DOING THAT -- AND CERTAINLY -- THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS THAT CURRENT STATE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA STATES THAT ALL VEHICLES AND CYCLISTS INCLUDED. MUST OBEY THE RIGHT HAND TURN LANE. EVEN IF THE BIKE LANE MARKINGS DIRECT CYCLISTS TO TRAVEL STRAIGHT -- AND SO CERTAINLY AS A RESULT OF THIS DETERS ME -- ARE MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM CREATING SHARED LANES -- DESPITE THEIR WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE AS A AS AS AS A BEST PRACTICE IN IN THE NAME OF SAFETY. AND SO AGAIN THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT PRACTICE IS LEGAL AND WOULD REQUIRE CALTRANS TO DEVELOP STANDARD LANE MARKINGS FOR CYCLISTS WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION AND SO CERTAINLY WITH ME TODAY IS DAVE SNYDER FROM THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I STAY SNYDER CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID WELL I WILL I JUST URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD DEAL. SEVEN ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR SHARE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHORS BILL. I'LL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE TO THE AUTHOR [inaudible] MR FUNG. HAVE YOU TALKED TO APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE THE BILL FORWARD HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION HOW DID THEY FEEL ABOUT. THE CONFORMITY CONCERNS -- IF THE CITY CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY STANDARDS. I'LL -- ALL THE FURNACES -- NINE THE FEDERAL PLACE. THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION HAS -- DESIGNS TO ACCOMMODATE THIS MANEUVER -- THE CALTRANS A MANUAL DOES NOT SO WITH THIS BILL. WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE CALTRANS MANUAL -- CONFORMS WITH WHAT THE IF IF IT'S W. A. SAYING. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THE FH A TWO EIGHT HAS CONCERNS WITH THIS TYPE OF I GUESS STRUCTURE OF THE LANE AND THAT THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL CENTER SO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE CONFLICTING -- KNEES YEAH I UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT DOES. TO BE HONEST I MIGHT BE THINKING OF THE IMMINENT. DESIGN MANUAL THAT I SAW AT A CONFERENCE THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE THIS DESIGN AND NOT THE CURRENT. ONE SO YOUR YOUR FROM YOUR ANALYSIS OR FOR YOUR FREE THE RESEARCH YOU'VE DONE THE YOU YOU'RE SAYING THE FEDERAL STANDARDS DOES ALLOW THIS. ALLOWS YOU TO PUT -- SHERO OR IN IN THE RIGHT TURN LANE OR WHAT'S GOING A POCKET BIKE LANE BETWEEN THE RIGHT TURN LANE AND THE THRILLING. OKAY BUT MY CONCERN IS ONLY THAT IFWE HAVE CONFLICTING STANDARDS THAT AND SOMEHOW YOU NOW WE'RE NOT ALLOWED THAT THE ROADS THAT YOU CURRENTLY. GET FEDERAL FUNDING ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GET FEDERAL FUNDING IF SOMEHOW WERE CALTRANS OUT OF COMPLIANCE SO THAT'S WHY I'M JUST I'M TRYING UNDERSTAND -- IF IF THE IF THE IF THERE IS A CONCERN OR THAT COULD BE ADDRESS IN SOME WAY. YES I I LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THAT THE FEDS WERE AHEAD OF THIS ONE IF I'M MISTAKEN ON THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE THIS IS -- ALREADY APPROVED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS AND THE FHWA IS CATCHING UP. OKAY IF IF YOU COULD PROVIDE IF IT IF YOU COULD JUST. YEAH SURE SURE YEAH THEY ARE VERY MUCH. YEAH QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. THREE THIS WAS LIKE CLOSE YOU KNOW THE ONLY CONCLUSION I HAS IT HAVE IS I RESPECT THE ASPEN AYE BONES ONLY THIS IS GOOD PLANNING THIS IS -- YOU KNOW A GOOD CHANGE IN POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. DO DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE SAFETY ON OUR STREETS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES IN CYCLES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT MR IS ALWAYS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A WORKING GROUP BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. WILL BE PUTTING OF W. HHA TOGETHER WITH CALTRANS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO. QUESTION WHEN IT IS IT IS AND IF IT IMPLEMENTED. A MAN AS A CYCLIST MYSELF I SAFETY IS IMPORTANT TO ME ALSO. HAS TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE MORE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. INCLUDING THE DOUBLING ITS FUNDING. FROM SB ONE WE MUST WORK ON MAKING SURE THE MORE THE MOTORIST. CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS CAN CO EXIST SEC YOU KNOW. SAFELY. AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A FIRST MISTER BERMAN SECOND FROM MR DAILY -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FRAZIER. HI FRAZIER AYE FONG. PHONE NOT VOTING AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I BERMAN. BERMAN AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NOT VOTING [inaudible] TO CUNNINGHAM. DALY. DALY AYE DEEP [inaudible] FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. GIPSON AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE MEDINA. NAZARIAN. IS THERE AND I O'DONNELL. THAT IS SEVEN LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN CRAP SOME MEMBERS THANK YOU. I SAW SOME THE OTHER YAWNING MISTER A JONES SAWYER. HEY GET YOUR GET YOU FIRED UP. IT'S OKAY WITH YOU WILL START WITH A B.. THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE DELYLAH. NO I WASN'T YANNI KNOWS SAYING HEY I'M NEXT. I MEAN BECAUSE GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING GOOD NIGHT CHAIRMAN -- I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY PARKING AND TRAFFIC TICKETS. THE A COMMUNITY SERVICE CALIFORNIA FACES A HOUSING CRISIS AND LOS ANGELES ALONE THERE ARE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS MAYES INDIVIDUALS ARE LIVING IN THE STREETS PARKS OR EVEN IN THEIR VEHICLES. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS LOSING THEIR VEHICLE DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT LOSING THAT THAT THEY'RE LOSING ONLY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IT ALSO MEANS ARE LOSING THEIR HOME. CITIES AND NONPROFITS IN LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO. SANTA BARBARA AND SAN JOSE EXPLORED NEW APPROACHES TO HELP YOUR VEHICULAR HOMELESS THROUGH SELF PARKING PROGRAMS. THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS PROVIDE TO VEHICULAR OF HOMELESS A SAFE PLACE TO PARK FOR FREE OVERNIGHT WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING A RASTER TICKETED. PROGRAMS PROGRAMS LIKE SAFE PARKING LA CONNECT INDIVIDUALS WITH COUNSELING AND A SYSTEM WITH FINDING HOUSING. HOWEVER WHEN PROVIDED THE SERVICES THE VEHICULAR HOMELESS REMAIN AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR VEHICLE OR BEING BURDENED WITH DEBT. IT IS UNFAIR TO NOT PROVIDE THESE INDIVIDUALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY OFF THEIR TICKETS THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE WHEN WE REVIVED THAT OPTION FOR CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR HAVING PEOPLE LIVE IN YOUR VEHICLE IS NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE FAILED CALIFORNIANS AND LEFT MANY WITHOUT ANY OTHER CHOICE. MUST PROVIDE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE DOES THAT BY GIVING PEOPLE REASONABLE WAY TO PAY OFF THEIR TICKETS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. IS AMY PERKINS DIRECTOR OF IN A HIGHS AND STRATEGIES FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE -- MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE RIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU MISTER JONES. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME THE RIVERS I AM ANY PERKINS REPRESENTING THEM MAYOR CARCETTI FROM LOS ANGELES THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FRAZIER VICE CHAIR FONG. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER FOR AUTHORING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CALL THEIR CAR HOME THIS BILL PROMISES TO PROVIDE INCREDIBLY NEEDED RELIEF. LOS ANGELES HAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL CAP PROGRAM ALREADY OPERATING WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE PARKING PROGRAM. WHAT I LOVED ESPECIALLY ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT MATCHES PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS WITH A PROVIDER WHO WILL ASSIGN THEM TASKS AS THEY'RE WORKING OFF THIS COMMUNITY SERVICE IN LIEU OF PAYING THEIR CITATIONS? THIS GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT TO AN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CONNECT TO A PROVIDER WHO MAY END UP HIRING THEM OR GIVING THEM SOME EXPERIENCE ON THEIR RESUME OR EVEN GIVING THEM A GENERAL REFERENCE FOR ANOTHER JOB. SO WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR BRINGING THIS TODAY IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND APPRECIATED AND WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS WOULD YOU STAND UP AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF. PLAYSTATION. FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIR. MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY A WE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE'RE UP HERE EARLIER TODAY WITH MR CHOO'S BILL ON TOWING.

AND HELP THESE PEOPLE GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND THEN I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY HERE BY THIS IS A VERY CREATIVE USE OF COMMUNITY SERVICE WE THINK. IT REALLY WELL AND SET UP YOU KNOW HAVING PEOPLE DO TASK THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF WORK AUTHOR FIND. AND GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED HOPEFULLY TO GET HOUSE AND OUT OF THE CAR SO WE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE. IN MEMBERS THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE SAYS FINE OPPOSITION OR SHARE THE CONCERNS.

GRAYSON AYE MEDINA [inaudible] NAZARIAN [inaudible] DONALD [inaudible] OR DON'T [inaudible] AND I WITH. IT IS TOTALLY THE ROLE PERHAPS MEMBERS WE LIKE TO PROCEED. ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL WHICH IS -- SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN CENTURY -- GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT EVERY FEELS A CAT A COURT'S AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND DRIVERS PRIVILEGES FOR VANDALISM IN RECENT YEARS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARDS ANY TO PRACTICE OF SUSPENDING DRIVING PRIVILEGES FOR INFRACTIONS I'M RELATED TO DRIVING SUCH AS UNPAID FINES AND TRUANCY. CURRENTLY A COURT WAS REQUIRED TO SUSPEND OR DELAYED DRIVING PRIVILEGES. FOR ONE TO THREE YEARS WHEN A PERSON IS CONVICTED OF VANDALISM SUSPENDING DRIVING PRIVILEGES FOR INFRACTIONS I'M RELATED TO DRIVING CREATED UNNECESSARY BURDEN OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO COMMUTE TO SCHOOL. AND MEDICAL VISITS OR WORK. ACCORDING TO THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW POVERTY LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY LICENSE SUSPENSIONS THE ABILITY TO DRIVE IS CRUCIAL FOR MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THEY'RE OFTEN THEY OFTEN COMMUTE TO WORK AT A FARTHER DISTANCE TO WORK LATE SHIFTS MAKING IT HARDER TO RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN WHAT CONTINUE TO PUT THE FOCUS ON INFRACTIONS RELATED TO DRIVING BY REMOVING COURTS ABILITIES HAS BEEN A PERSON'S LIFE AND FOR VANDALISM. HERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IS IS FROM MY INGRAM FROM THE ACLU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE GUY THOUGH. MY ANGER -- ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT DRIVERS LICENSE SUSPENSIONS CAN CREATE A VICIOUS ECONOMIC CYCLE FOR INDIVIDUALS I CAN BE VERY HARD TO BREAK WE'VE SEEN THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY OF USING THIS AS A PUNISHMENT FOR OFFENSES NOT RELATED TO SAFE DRIVING. HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED CALIFORNIANS WHEN WE SUSPENDED LICENSE FOR FAILURE TO APPEAR OR PAY A TICKET WE SAW THAT THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION RATES FOR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH POVERTY RATES. AND HIGH PERCENTAGES OF BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS BLACK LATINO RESIDENTS WITHIN DISPROPORTIONATELY ARRESTED FOR DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN BY PARTISAN INITIATIVE TO REVERSE THIS COURSE AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE OF BILLS THAT ALIGNS WITH THAT PATH THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE [inaudible] IN SUPPORT.

WE JUST CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. HI MISTER JONES SAWYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN BRING THIS FORWARD. THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WAS RIGHT TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO. WHEN THEY SAID SUSPENDING DRIVER'S LICENSES FOR VANDALISM? IS BAD POLICY. DRIVING IS ESSENTIALLY SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR DANGEROUS DRIVERS OR ONE FEDERALLY REQUIRED. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY THAT THIS FIRST BY MR GRAYSON. SECOND BY MISTER GIPSON. KIND OF SECRETARY CULTURAL.

THAT IS THE WILL LEAVE THE RULES AND PERHAPS A MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER LACKEY. THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE PLEASE [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. UP TO A GOOD START. THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'D FIRST LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING -- MISTER CHAIR AND FIRST AFTER WORKING. WITH OUR OFFICE ON THIS BILL. A SECOND SECOND WAS REALLY APPRECIATED I APPRECIATE THAT. AB I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK I PROMISE. AB THIRTY FIFTY ONE WHAT AUTHORIZES THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION AGENCY TO CONSULT WITH PUBLIC TRANSIT. TO ASSESS THE PROCEDURES IN ADMINISTRATION OF RIDE SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. YOU COULD TAKE NEARLY A MONTH. FOR A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY CAN USE AND AGENCIES PARA TRANSIT SERVICE FROM CONSIDERING THE ENTIRETY OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS. MOREOVER IT'S EVEN MORE BURDENSOME FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO NEED A RIDE IN A JURISDICTION. OUTSIDE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY APPROVED SERVICE AREA. FOR EXAMPLE IF AN INDIVIDUAL WAS DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES SACRAMENTO. BUT WAS VISITING IN THE LOS ANGELES SERVICE AREA. THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LENGTHY PROCESS TO PROVE THEIR ELIGIBILITY WHICH INVOLVES A FAX MACHINE. THIS BILL INITIATES THE PROCESS OF AND I'M NOT KIDDING -- IN WHICH OUR STATE CAN BEGIN IDENTIFYING GAPS IN THE DIAL THE RIGHT PAIR TRANSIT SYSTEM AND BEGIN STREAMLINING THE PROCESS WHICH INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CAN -- USE RIGHT SERVICES FREE THEY WITH ME TODAY REAL BRIEFLY WILL BE DANIEL SABINO. DANIEL SERVING -- ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES BRIEFLY IF ANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS CAME UP HERE TO VISIT YOU NEED PARA TRANSIT THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LONG PROCESS TO GET THAT SAME SERVICE APPROVED UP HERE. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE ISSUE OF X.. EQUITY OF ACCESS AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS -- LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND OF COURSE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC TO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL OR SHARE CONCERNS. ME SO FOR STATE YOUR NAME WHO YOU'RE REPRESENTING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE MICHAEL CAM TELL THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION -- FOR REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY WOULD REQUIRE AS YOU KNOW THE CAN CALVINISTIC TRANSPORTATION ASSIST -- AGENCY TO ASSESS THE PROCEDURES PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES USED TO GRANT VISITOR STATUS FOR EDA AND GOTTEN DOWNRIGHT SERVICES. TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND AUTHORIZES THEM TO ADOPT GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED A WIDE RECIPROCITY -- WE BELIEVE THAT GENERALLY THE STATEWIDE PERSON THAT STATEWIDE RECIPROCITY IS ALREADY THE LAW OF THE LAND AND SPOKEN TO CLEARLY AN EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. INTO THE CENTER THERE'S FRAGMENTATION THE PROCEDURES AGENCIES HOLOGRAM VISITOR SARACEN AND AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS -- RESULTS FROM DIFFERENCES IN STAFFING RESOURCES FUNDING BILL ABILITY IN THE USE OF IN HOUSE VERSUS CONTRACT -- SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THIS SORT OF FRAGMENTATION IS NOT DISSIMILAR FROM WHAT WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN TRANSIT OPERATIONS WHETHER THAT'S FAIR PAYMENT WE FINDING. RATHER MEANS -- FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS -- WE BELIEVE WHAT'S NEED IS GREATER CONSISTENCY IN HOW PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING THIS OR STATUS ARE COMMUNICATED TO THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES OR THE ELDERLY. AND TO THAT END WE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE ISSUE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. WHICH WHATEVER PARTY TRANSIT AGENCY TO POST ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INTERNET WEBSITE -- IN PLAIN LANGUAGE AND IN A COMMON FORMAT THE PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING VISITOR STATUS FOR EDA AND DOLLAR RIGHT SERVICES. SURE THING -- THIS REQUIREMENT COULD BEEN EXTENDED TO A COMMON SCRIPT -- FOR FOR PHONE CALLS -- AND MOREOVER WE UNDERSTAND AS THE AUTHOR NOTED THAT SOME AGENCIES ARE STILL USING FAX MACHINES WE WOULD HAVE ENDORSED A STRATEGY THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE EXCEPT ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATION V. ELECTRONICS THE MIDDLE. AND WITH THAT -- BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT -- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILLER CONCERNS. CINEMA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. MR LIKE HE WAS LIKE CLOSE.

AS A STATE WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AN EASIER AND SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE VISITING ANOTHER JURISDICTION. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION SO ASSOCIATIONS POSE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE BILL BECAUSE WE HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED. PUBLIC TRANS THANK YOU.

SO WE'RE GONNA GO WITH MR CHOO'S. MR TO REALLY LOOK AT EIGHT OO EIGHT ABA FADE AWAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF A WALLACE THANK YOU COMING STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL -- THAT THIS BILL ORIGINALLY WAS WRITTEN TO REQUIRE. DAD WHEN TO THE DRIVER TURN ON DAY OR WHITE PER. OF OF A WHILE WE NOTE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS THE EXISTING LAW. DEV MINDED ONE WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE RAIN YOU TURN ON YOUR WIPERS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TURN ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS. BUT IT IS THIS A VERY VERY HARD TO ENFORCE YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY SOME MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL DURING THE RAINY SEASON THE CITY OF ABOUT ONE IN FIVE CARDS ACTUALLY TURN ON THEIR HEADLIGHTS. THEN IN BECAUSE IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- TO TO TO ENFORCE IT. SO WHAT WHAT THAT -- TO PROMPT ME FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT AFTER. REVIEWING OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING TO SOME OF THE OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS. YOU KNOW THEY USE. WHAT I LEARNED THAT THE RIGHT NOW LIKE IN GM GENERAL WALTER THE ALL THEIR FLEETS? WILL HAVE TO RUN THE LIGHT TOM. WIN WIN -- ALL THE TIME. AND ALSO THIS IS THE ALSO AGREED -- LOGGING IN CANADA I REQUIRE ANY CARS THAT THE ASSAULTING CANDOR THAT WILL HELP THEIR HEADLIGHTS ON AND TELL LIKE TOM. SO. JUST TO MAKE THEY IMPLEMENTATION EASIER. OF ALL I WOULD JUST DO THE AMENDMENT TO SAY WHAT WILL FOLLOW THAT THE THAT THE CANADIAN LAW. TO SAY YOU KNOW TO ALWAYS HALF THE HEADLIGHTS ON AND THE TAIL LIGHT ON OF AND WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING. THEM I ALSO KNOW THE BENEFIT LIKE OF THE A LOT OF THE CALIFORNIA FREEWAYS LIKE BUT ONE FIFTY TWO THIS ALSO APPLIED AT THE DISTRICT WHICH CONNECT THE INTERSTATE FIVE AND WHILE. ONE THERE'S A SESSION TO JUST TELL YOU TO TURN ON YOUR HELLO YOU MEN IN IN THE BROUGHT BRIGHT DAYLIGHT AND AGAIN. IN A A VERY -- FEEL PEOPLE REALLY REALLY -- OF OF FOLLOW THAT THE LAW TO TURN ON THE LIGHT SO OF THE DUE DATE TO CUT THEY A MEMBER IN THIS. TOO I HAVE STILL ALL THE CAR MANUFACTURERS. NEWS WOULD BE A DETERRENT. TO HOW THE HELL HELL LIGHT THAT THE THAT THE RUNNING LIGHTS ON AND THE AND THE TAIL LIGHTS ALL. ON ALL THE CARS THAT THIS SHOW TO TO WORK A CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THOUGH THE CALIFORNIA SET THE PACE. FOR A PHOTO FOR THE NATION -- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TWENTY SOME DIFFERENT STATE ALREADY HEALTH TO SIMILAR LAW TO SAY HEY TURN TURN ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS. ON WHEN YOU TURN ON YOUR WIFE. ESPECIALLY THE THE TELL LIGHTS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE. TO TO TO SEAL TO TO MAKE SURE YOU YOUR VISIBLE. AND IT DID DEPART DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ALSO HAS SOME STUDY THERE'S A THE THE WEATHER RELATED ACCIDENT MAKE UP TO ABOUT 21% OF ALL ACCIDENTS ON THE ROAD. AND AND ALSO THE ODORS SOME STUDIES YOU SHOULD THE SHOWED THAT -- CARS WHICH WERE. RUNNING LIGHTS ON WILL REDUCE THE ACCIDENT RATE JUST TO UP PILL CARS WITHOUT THE LIFESAVING LIGHT. A WITH ALL THE LIGHT RUNNING LIGHT ON A ONE POINT SEVEN THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE COLLISION BANK CARD -- WITH -- DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME ON SO I THINK THIS IS A BILL I I WOULD ILL DAY DAVE THE MANUFACTURERS OF OF HOLES IN A IN PRINCIPLE CON MAN THIS IS TRULY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION TO THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT. THEY AGREED THAT IS A GOOD SAFETY FUTURE. AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS ACTUALLY -- A GOOD MARKET BASED ARGUMENT FOR THEM. AND THE CARS HE QUIPPED DID WAS THE OF WAS JUST FUTURE PROBABLY WILL SELL BETTER THAN OTHERS WITHOUT IT. SO -- GM ACTUALLY AND MADE THE PETITION TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION -- TO REQUIRED THAT THE LIFESAVING DAYLIGHT WHEN THE LIGHTS ON AS THE NATIONAL STANDARD IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE I KNOW I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAY CONGRESS TO TO ACT ON ON ON ISSUES LIKE THAT. BUT I FAILED THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA WE CAN DEMONSTRATE TO TO TO TO COME TO TO THE OTHER STATE. AND TO THE CONGRESS THAT WE VALUE OUR A DAYS CALIFORNIANS LIFE BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER STATES. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE CONGRESS TO ADD ON THIS BILL I DECIDED TO OF A MOVE FOR AN INDUSTRY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. MY CONGRESSMAN A REAL CON THE OLD ALSO COMMITTED TO CARRY THE BILL IN THE AND IN THE CONGRESS BUT AGAIN. IN CELL AWAITING I WILL LIKE -- TO PRESENTED.

THANK YOU ANY MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WILL BRING IT BACK. QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MISTER IS THERE IN [inaudible] UP. WHAT IS A REASONABLE TIME LINE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS? YOU DON'T GENERALLY VEHICLE DESIGN FROM FIRST IDEAS AND ENGINEERING IS EIGHT TO TEN YEARS. I MEAN ON ON SORT ON ANY ASPECT OF OF THE VEHICLE. AND HAVE YOU WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH THE STAFF AND AND AND EXPLAIN OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL I MEAN AGAIN. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE LOGISTICS IN TERMS THE PRACTICAL IMPACT WOULD PLACE ON THE AUTO MANUFACTURES THE OTHER RIGHT REALITY IS IS THAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT -- ANYTHING THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD DO PURSUANT TO THIS PARTICULAR MISSION WOULD BE -- PRECLUDED FROM NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DID YOU SEE TWENTY SEVEN STATES I'M SORRY DID YOU SEE THAT TWENTY SEVEN STATES HAVE ALREADY. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IS ROUTE THE STATE HOUSE THE LAW ALL THOSE WHO REQUIRED A DRIVER TO TURN ON THEIR HOW LIGHT -- WHEN WHEN WHEN THEY TURN ON THEIR WIPER BUT AGAIN? THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO TWO ONE FOUR FIVE I DON'T KNOW IF TO SEE IF YOU HAD WRITTEN ANY. OF THE TICKET FOR FOR THE VIOLATORS. IN IN CALIFORNIA SO. AND AND THIS IS WHY I ASKED FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. THE TO TO TO TO MAY MAKE OR THROUGH A SAFER SAVE SOME LIVES. HI PAM IF I MAY SIR JUST TO CLARIFY TO WITH REGARDS. TO INCORRECTLY IF I'M WRONG SIR RIGHT AT THE AUTHOR DISTRICT SECURE IS REFERRING TO THE THIS MEDIUM BILL CENTER SO MANY OF BILL THAT. REQUIRED FOLKS DRIVERS -- IN INCLEMENT WEATHER THIS IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO TURN ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS. WITH THE WIN SHARP WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE DR. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY -- STATE -- STUDIES -- HAVE HAD LOOKED INTO THE EFFICACY OF THAT LAW SINCE IT'S BEEN IN IN ENACTED FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. WITH REGARD TO THETWENTY SEVEN STATES I BELIEVE AGAIN -- 323- STATES THAT'S WITH REGARDS TO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT -- THAT THIS MEDIAN BILL REQUIRES ITS OF THE DRIVER THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT IT'S UNIQUE IT'S IT'S PRESCRIBING A SPECIFIC DESIGN REQUIREMENT OF THE VEHICLE. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT MR SO MANY IS BILL DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIS EXISTING LAW AND THE OTHER. TWENTY THREE TWENTY SO THEY ARE SIX SORRY. SORRY I DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR WITH THE TWENTY THREE STATES THIS TO DRIVERS THE THE WIPERS ON THE HAT TAILLIGHTS ARE. RIGHT AND THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SHOULD. ASK THE MANUFACTURERS TO TAKE UP SOME RESPONSIBILITY [inaudible] SO. WE'RE WERE THE FIRST CALIFORNIA. I I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT SO THAT MOVING FORWARD HOPEFULLY -- YOU'RE ABLE TO COME TO SOME CONCLUSION OF WHERE YOU SEE. THE APPROPRIATE MEDIUM IS -- BUT FOR TODAY I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TO ME AT LEAST -- SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. SEARCH USUALLY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE AGAIN -- I BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. ALL OF THEM MOST OF OUR CAR MAKERS KNOW HOW TO DO. IT -- TO THE TURN ON THAT THE RUNNING LIGHTS AND THE HEADLIGHTS WHEN YOU TURN ON THE ENGINE. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE REQUIRED OF ME MAJOR. ENGINEERING CHANGER TO SIGN. AND I AM REALLY HOPING THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT. FASTER THAN OURS THE GOOD THE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND AND I'M NOT TAKING THE TEN YEAR TO IMPLEMENT THIS. AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE THIS IS ALREADY A CANADIAN LAW. I THINK THE THE ANY HARDER STILL THE MOVE. TO BE SOLD IN CANADA WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS -- AND THE HEADLIGHTS AND AND HELL LIGHTS ALL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE SO -- WILL DISCUSS THE PALE PRETTY MUCH YEAH THAT'S COMING LINE WHAT WAS THE TIMING FOR THE CANADIAN BILL TO TAKE EFFECT -- AND AND TO DO IT AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A IS A ADORABLE. AND AGAIN I'LL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY COULD AND UNITED HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. OF I BELIEVE MOTOR VEHICLE STACY SAFETY STANDARDS SHOULD BE UP TO NHTSA NOW -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE C. H. P. -- WE DID TRY TO ADD OFFICERS LEISURE TO AID IN THAT BUT IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR -- ACTUAL IS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY OFFICERS OVER FOUR YEARS -- BUT THAT WAS -- NOT CONSIDERED IMPORTANT.

ONE ONE ONE TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB ELEVEN TWELVE ESTABLISHES A BASIC LEVEL OF STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR LOCAL REGULATION OF MOTORIZED SCOOTERS. TO ENSURE CLARITY IN THE LAW TO ENABLE ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND INCREASED SAFETY ON THE ROAD. IN THE US 35% OF VEHICLE TRIPS OR TWO MILES OR LESS IN LENGTH ONE SOLUTION TO THESE CHALLENGES IS THE GROWTH OF MICROBES MOBILITY OPTIONS LIKE YOU SCOOTERS. THIS GROWING OPTIONS ARE AN AFFORDABLE AND CONVENIENT SOLUTION FOR THE SHORT CAR TRIPS. EASE CRITTERS ARE A LAST MILE LINK TO PUBLIC TRANSIT ENABLING PEOPLE TO FLEXIBLY TRAVEL TO BUS STOPS AND TRAIN STATIONS WITHOUT THE NEED TO PARK A CAR OR SECURE CURRENTLY THERE'S A PATCHWORK OF ORDINANCES REGULATING EAST COOTER SINCE MIMES NO REGULATION AT ALL IN SOME LOCALITIES WITH VERY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR WRITERS UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THERE'S NOT IN COMPLIANCE. THIS ALSO MAKES IT COMPLICATED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO A FOREIGN FORCE AMONG THE DIFFERENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIES. I INTEND TO WORK WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRNT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S WORKABLE FOR MUNICIPALITIES. THANK YOU MEMBERS I BELIEVE THIS BILL PROVIDES A REASONABLE STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AND IS NECESSARY FOR THIS GROWING TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWELVE ARMORIES HENDERSON DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS A BIRD SCOOTERS. AND JULIE AND THE CANAL -- CONNECT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO START. THANKS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. ELEVEN TWELVE MY NAME IS MAURICE HENDERSON AND I'M DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS WITH BIRD SCOOTERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THE WORK THEY DON'T US TO DATE. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND AS THE AUTHOR NOTES BELIEVE IT IS PART OF THE STATE'S SOLUTION TO REACHING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. BIRD IS A LAST SMILE ORCHARD VEHICLE SHARING COMPANY DEDICATED TO BRINGING AFFORDABLE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS TO COMMITTEE TO COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE WORLD. BIRDS MISSION OFFERS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND CITY STREETS YOU CAN MOVE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE PER HOUR IN A PROTECTED BIKE LANE. AND APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND VEHICLES PER HOUR AND A HALF IN THE AVERAGE CARLIN. AFTER ONE YEAR OF OPERATING MORE THAN. FOURTEEN MILLION MILES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON BIRDS AROUND THE WORLD. WHICH IS PREVENTED MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION POUNDS OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM ENTERING THE AIR. IN ADDITION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BIRD WE HAVE INSURED EQUABLE ACCESS CREATING MORE AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. WE CREATED ONE BIRD FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE. TO HAVE THE ONE DOLLAR UNLOCK FEE WAIVED FOR EACH RIDE IN ADDITION WE CREATED RED WHITE AND BIRD WHICH DOES THE SAME FOR ACTIVE MILITARY AND VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION. FINALLY BIRD HAS HAD A POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND BIRDS IN A CITY BURKE CREATES AN ESTIMATED TWO AND A HALF MILLION ANNUAL EARNINGS FOR CHARGERS AND THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND WE HAVE FOUND THAT BIRD CAN SAVE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR WRITERS IN AN AVERAGE MONTH WHEN COMPARED TO THE COST OF TAKING A TAXI UBER OR LIFT FOR SIMILAR TRIPS. FOR THESE REASONS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT A. B. ELEVEN TWELVE IN ORIGIN I VOTE THANK YOU. MAN UNION TWO MINUTES. NEXTEL WITH THIS PLEASE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND AND THANK YOU -- TO MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR INTRODUCING -- ELEVEN TWELVE CALPERS MEDIC CHAMBERS FULLY SUPPORTS -- ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN TWELVE WITH PHYLLIS DEVILISH IS MUCH NEEDED CLARIFICATION. ELECTRIC SCOOTER REGULATIONS -- AS CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLE COLD CURRENTS GOOD REGULATIONS ARE CONFUSION AND I'M CLEAR. CURRENTLY THERE IS A HAPHAZARD AN ILL CONCEIVED PATCHWORK OF ORDINANCES REGULATING ELECTRIC SCOOTERS WITH VARYING REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR WRITERS. ENFORCEMENT AGENTS TO UNDERSTAND COMPLIANCE. AB ELEVEN TWELVE SOLVE THESE ISSUE BY PROVIDING A CLEAR STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK THAT ALSO GIVES MUNICIPALITIES LOCAL CONTROL OVER OR IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ELECTRIC SCOOTER ADOPTION. BY PASSING AB ELEVEN TWELVE CALIFORNIA WILL ESTABLISH UNIFORM REGULATORY GUIDELINES THAT BRING THE STATE'S VEHICLE CODE. INTO ALIGNMENT WITH ITS AMBITIONS TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE GOALS. IN CALIFORNIA 87% OF THE POPULATION RESIDES IN URBAN AREAS AND THOSE AREAS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET GROWING TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION AND PARKING NEEDS NOT EVERY WEEK EVERYONE CAN LIVE OR WORK WITHIN EASY WALKING DISTANCE OF A TRANSIT STATION OR BUS STOP. THE US -- CITIES EVEN ONES WITH EXCELLENT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MUST RELY ON CAR TRANSIT AND THEREBY SUFFER FROM TRAFFIC CONGESTION. PARKING -- PROBLEMS AND EXCESSIVE AUTO EMISSIONS. EASING CONGESTION AND EMISSIONS IS CRUCIAL CRITICAL. TO OUR HEALTH AND WELLNESS POOR AIR QUALITY IS THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL RISK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO A STUDY SET. TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FINE PARTICULATE MATTER POLLUTION. IS ESPECIALLY HARMFUL AND IS RESPONSIVE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS EACH YEAR FROM HEART ATTACKS STROKES. LUNG CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES. MICHAEL MOBILITY OPTIONS LIKE A SCOOTER OFFER AFFORDABLE CONVENIENT SOLUTIONS. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT PROVIDE FIRST SMILE AND LAST MILE LINKS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WHERE 35% OF ALL VEHICLE TRIPS IN UNITED STATES OUR TWO MILES OF LASSEN LATE. SO NATURAL TO WORK AROUND THOSE PLEASE I'M GONNA MORE SENSE OF AB ELEVEN TWELVE HELP FINANCIALLY GOING TO ASK YOU TO WRAP OKAY -- ENCLOSING A. B.

STEPHEN BOX TRANSIT COALITION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR [inaudible] MISTER NAZARIAN. I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A QUESTION SO YOU KNOW MISTER NAZARIAN LET ME GO TO OPPOSITION FIRST. PLEASE -- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THE LIKES TESTIFYING OPPOSITION. OR HAVE CONCERNS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE S. A LEASH ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION -- AT THE AGENCY SORRY -- AFTER THE UNREGULATED LAUNCH OF SCOOTER. SHARE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STREET ACROSS THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO RESPONDED TO PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. AND INSTITUTE A REGULATIONS TO GUIDE MOTORIZED MOTOR -- SHARED SCOOTER PROGRAMS -- THIS CAME ASKED AFTER MANY SAFETY CONCERNS FROM OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS REGARDING INJURED WRITERS AND SCOOTERS LEFT IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY INHIBITING PEDESTRIAN. ACCESS AS WELL AS EDA ACCESS -- AS VERY SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO INJURED WRITERS SINCE THESE PROGRAMS WERE AT SINCE THESE GOOD OR SHARE PROGRAMS BECAME AVAILABLE IN LATE. TWO TWENTY SEVENTEEN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED AND A UCLA STUDY FOUND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PEOPLE WHO REQUIRED MEDICAL CARE WITH SEVERE INJURIES MANY OF THOSE INCLUDING HEAD TRAUMA -- SFM TA ARE CREATED A POWERED SCOOTER SHARE PERMIT AND PILOT PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES KEY SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION AND EQUITY CONCERNS WITH THIS NEW MOBILITY SERVICE. HOWEVER IF THIS BILL PASSES HE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO REQUIRE AND FORCED KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR PROGRAM. INCLUDING OUR AUTHORITY TO CITE SCOOTERS LEFT IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY AND OUR ABILITY TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE LOW INCOME PROGRAMS. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT PROHIBITS AUTHORITIES FROM IMPOSING ANY UNDULY RESTRICTIVE REQUIREMENTS ON SHARED SCOOTER OPERATORS WITHOUT DEFINING THIS TERM OUTSIDE OF COST. THIS AMBIGUITY CONCERNS AS AND IT COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE KEY SAFETY IN EQUITY ELEMENTS OF OUR PILOT PROGRAM. LASTLY THE DATA PROVISIONS OF THE BILL MAY PROHIBIT SHARING OF ANY DATA WITH THE PUBLIC AND WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR SHARING AND ON A MAIS TRIP DATA PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE I'D ALSO LIKE TO VOICE THE OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA WHICH SHARES SIMILAR CONCERNS AS THE S. SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS ONE IS PLEASE. CITY ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER TWENTY THE CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO TRY TO BRING SOME REGULATIONS OF THESE THESE SCOOTERS. ARE THE SOLUTION IS PROBLEMATIC I WON'T REPEAT THE ARGUMENTS ALREADY MADE WITH A LINERS OF THOSE ARGUMENTS AND ALSO ADD THAT WE BELIEVE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE TOO LOW. AND THEY'RE FAR BELOW AND CITIES LIKE SANTA SANTA MONICA SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. SO MISTER NAZARIAN HOME BRING BACK TO SINCE -- MY INTERRUPT YOU APOLOGIZE NOT AT ALL NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS BECAUSE AND I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS EARLIER ON THE FLOOR WHEN I ACTUALLY. HAD A MOMENT TO TO SIT WITH YOU -- I I'VE GENERALLY NOT SUPPORTED BILLS THAT WOULD ALLOW CERTAIN TYPES OF OF MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. IF WE DID NOT PLAY CERTAIN. SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE HEAD GEAR AND OR OTHER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. WERE PUT INTO PLACE SO -- YOU SPEAK TO THAT IS THIS DOES WITH THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND IT ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WOULD WE HAVE AN OVER. ARCHING VIEW OF SAYING WELL THESE ARE THE SAFETY STANDARDS. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE I WASN'T EVEN SURE IF ANYONE WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO IT BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THE HEAD TRAUMA INJURY. THE BILL DOES ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DICTATE FOR INSTANCE WERE SCOOTERS ARE ALLOWED TO SO IT WOULD ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTION TO SAY YOU CAN'T RIDE SCOOTERS ON THE SIDEWALK YOU CAN ONLY BE A PROTECTED LANES. IT DOES GIVE A WIDE -- BIRTH TO LOCALITIES TO HAVE THE SCOOTERS WORK FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WAYS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE SAFE FOR PEOPLE -- SO WE TRY TO REALLY BALANCE THE ABILITY FOR LOCALITIES TO REGULATE SCOOTERS -- WITH YOU KNOW TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME UP WITH THOSE REGULATIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM JUST AREN'T AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC -- AND SORT OF JUST SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY SCOOTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE IT RIGHT YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY HAVE. PROBLEMS WITH -- YOU KNOW THE THE SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE RENTS A SCOOTER AND WON CITY AND IS THE WRITING INTO THE NEXT ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS RADICALLY CHANGE THE MACHINE JUST STOPS WORKING ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE NO IN AND FLAT OUT THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT ANY NOTICE FOR THE USERS. WE WANTED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT GAVE SOME BASIC FRAMEWORK BUT STILL GAVE THE LOCALITIES A LOT OF LEEWAY TO REGULATE. I'M HOW THIS TUTORED SCOOTERS ARE GOING TO WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY SO WE ARE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DISCUSS. THAT WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK WITH ANY OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALLOW. THEM TO HAVE THE CAN SPLIT THE SCOOTERS IN A WAY THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR THEM AND THAT SAY FOR THE COMMUNITY -- BUT WE NEED TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME ABILITY TO HAVE A STATEWIDE REGULATION THE SAME WAY THAT WE DO WITH BICYCLES AND WITH CARS AND ANY OTHER VEHICLE WHERE WE DON'T TO FOR A 100% TO LOCALITIES WE HAVE SOME OVER ARCHING -- REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND THEN THEY CAN OPERATE WITHIN THAT SO THIS IS REALLY IT'S ISN'T TO NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S YOU KNOW BEING VERY QUICKLY AND RAPIDLY. DEPLOYED ACROSS THE STATE AND WE THINK IT'S TIME FOR US AS A STATE NOW TO STEP IN WAS SOME JUST BASIC PARAMETERS AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL'S ATTEMPTING TO DO. SO IT IS STILL A BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS WE STILL HAVE YOU KNOW TIME WE HAVE OTHER COMMITTEES TO GO IN FRONT OF WHERE I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE THEIR IDEAS SO. YOU KNOW WE DO ASK -- I WOULD ASK FOR KIND OF THE LEEWAY TO LET US CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH EVERYBODY WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR WE KNOW HAVE WE HAVE TO GET IT TO THE SENATE BUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE TO START ACTING IN A IN. A STATEWIDE WAY TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE WITH THIS MODE OF TRANSPORTATION -- RESEARCHER. THANK YOU. EIGHT SO IF THERE'S WELL I GUESS I SHOULD JUST IF I SHOULD JUST ASK IF THERE'S NO BARE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARD. I'M GOING TO WITHHOLD SUPPORTING IT TODAY. BUT CAN YOU SPEAK. TO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT AT LEAST REQUIRES A BARE MINIMUM STANDARD OF SAFETY MEASURES. BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT ISSUE THIS IS AND DENSE AREAS AND I DON'T NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT DENSE AREAS YOU REPRESENT A VERY DENSE AREA YOURSELF. MISTREATMENT BUT IN MONDAY IN MY DISTRICT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL. NO LESS THAN TEN SQUARE MILES AREA THAT HAS SEVERE DENSITY OF JUST WHERE I LIVE. WITHIN FIVE BLOCKS OF WHERE I MY RESIDENCE IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND NEW APARTMENT UNITS COMING IN WITHIN THE NEXT TWO HOURS LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE THE MAN YOU'RE THE MANUFACTURERS ARE UNDER FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR SAFETY FOR THE VEHICLE ITSELF AND THEN IN TERMS. OF WHERE THEY'RE SAFE AND NOT SAFE TO RIDE FOR INSTANCE OF THEIR CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE SO DENSE THAT THERE'S JUST NO PLACE FOR THEM. UNDER A BILL THAT'S STILL IS UP TO THE LOCALITY TO DETERMINE WHERE THE SCOOTERS WE'RE GONNA ARE GONNA BE ALLOWED SO WE'RE NOT SET A STANDARD WELL THAT'S UP TO EACH CITY TO SAY FOR INSTANCE. LOS ANGELES MIGHT VERY WELL OR A SOME CITY MIGHT CHOOSE TO SAY WE ONLY WANT THE SCOOTERS IN A PROTECTED. ENVIRONMENT -- WE ONLY WANT THE SCOOTERS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF STREETS AND THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT THAT'S RIGHT THINK THE STATE SHOULDN'T COMMENTS AND TRY TO TELL CITIES EXACTLY WHERE AND WHERE NOT. IN THEIR COMMUNITY THEIR SAFE JUST THE WAY WE DON'T WITH BICYCLE WITH -- YOU KNOW WHERE WE DON'T DEMAND THAT CITIES. CREATE PROTECTED BY CLAIMS LET'S SAY ON CERTAIN STREETS WE LEAVE IT UP TO THEM TO DO THAT AND I THINK IT'S UP TO EACH MUNICIPALITY TO SAY. HEY THERE'S A LOT OF SCOOTER INTEREST IN MY CITY I BETTER SET UP SOME SAFE PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO RIDE AND I THINK THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR COMMUNITY. THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE DISSIDENTS SCOOTERS THE CITY SHOULD INSTALL SAFE PLACES FOR THOSE SCOOTERS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY ARE GOING TO END UP WITH SCOOTERS. YOU KNOW ON THE STREET UNSAFE CONDITIONS SO I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO THOSE LOCALITIES TO LOOK AT THEIR CONSTITUENCY. YOU KNOW IN SOME CITIES THEIR BABY THERE ARE A LOT OF SCOOTERS RAINY SCOOTER SO I WOULDN'T FORCE THEM TO GO AHEAD AND DO SO YOU KNOW PROTECTED SCOOTER LANES BUT OTHER CITIES PROBABLY SHOULD DO THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE IS BEST. CITY TO CITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE DEVICES THEMSELVES THERE CERTAINLY ARE MANDATES AS TO YOU KNOW SAFETY FOR THEM AND I THINK WE'LL SEE THAT INCREASING AT ALL AT THAT. FOLKS YOU KNOW ONE OF MY WITNESSES TESTIFY -- SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR. I'D SAY A COUPLE THINGS -- NUMBER ONE IN. IN OUR IN APP -- FEATURES WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE THE BIRD OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AMONGST THE MANY THINGS THAT YOU GO THROUGH IT AS AN ATTESTATION INCLUDING -- A TESTING THAT YOU ARE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OLDER -- WE TALK THROUGH THE DON'T KNOW NO WRITING ON SIDEWALKS OPTION WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE DECLARED -- THAT HELMET USE IS DEFINITELY THE PREFERRED OPTION -- WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CALL MANDATE THAT -- BUT WE CERTAINLY -- PREFER THAT PEOPLE WEAR HELMETS -- SECONDLY -- TO THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS POINTS OUT WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A GEO FENCING SO FOR EXAMPLE ON SANTA MONICA BIKE -- BEACH BIKE PATH -- WERE ABLE TO GEO SPEED -- THE SCOOTER DOWN THE BIRD DOWN TO ABOUT I THINK NOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING ABOUT THREE MILES AN HOUR -- IN THAT AREA THEY'RE ALSO AREAS LIKE IN A SCOTTSDALE ARIZONA FOR EXAMPLE I JUST WAS RECENTLY -- WE'VE GEO FENCE AROUND A A DENSE AREA THAT -- HAS A LOT OF PEDESTRIAN FOOT TRAFFIC -- SO THAT WE EITHER -- SLOWLY MOVE THE VEHICLE TO ZERO MILES PER HOUR WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PREFERRED PARKING AREAS ARE OUTSIDE OF THAT TESTIFIED. AREA SO THERE'S A LOT OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN -- BOTH AS A COMPANY AND AND WIDELY IN THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS. AND ARE ALSO ALLOWS LOCALITIES TO REQUIRE THE GEO FENCING FROM SINCE. SO THEY CAN STILL DO THAT. THANKS. MR O'DONNELL. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE BILL WAS FRIEDMAN ALWAYS SAY. THE SKATEBOARDING IS NOT A CRIME SCOOTER IS NOT A CRIME AS WELL. OF I JUST A QUESTION FOR YOU GENERAL MAYBE YOU CAN. RESPOND TO THIS WHAT A SCOOTER FALLS OVER -- IS IT DETECTED SOMEWHERE SUCH THAT THEY CAN RESPOND TO THAT SCOOTER FIRST AND PICK IT UP IS I HAVE TO SAY THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I ACTUALLY HAVE A CD CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN I GO AROUND THE COMMUNITY. I SEE A SKINNER THE SCOOTER. NOT A SKINNER -- I'VE SEEN THAT BUT A SCOOTER LAYING SIDEWAYS BUT DID THIS SOMETHING HAPPEN UNIQUE WHEN THERE IS A STATE IT'S DETECTED IF IT EVEN IS DETECTED. YEAH YES YEAH THERE'S A TELEMETRY DEVICE WITH AND EACH OF THE SCOOTERS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL. AND IN MOST AND WHAT WE DO WITH CITIES GENERALLY AS WE HAVE AN SLA OR A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT IN PLACE SO THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MINUTES OR HOURS OR WHATNOT. FOR OUR WE CALL BIRD WATCHERS PUN INTENDED -- TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE CLUTTER ISSUES SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND OUR TWELVE MONTHS OF ACTUAL OPERATION IN CITIES AND ARE SEVENTEEN MONTHS OF ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THE COMPANY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF CITIES AS BEST WE CAN AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO CITY AND ITS AGREEMENT. CORRECT COULD -- DESIGN AN ELEMENT WHERE AND WHEN THE SCOOTERS LAYING ON SITE. IT WOULD BE PICKED UP SOONER. THEN MAYBE OTHERS SO -- SURE. YES SO WE HAVE WE HAVE BIRD WATCHERS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING AROUND CITIES TO ENSURE THAT -- AS WE CALL IT NESTING THAT THE BIRDS ARE PLACED APPROPRIATELY LIKE I SAID THE PONDS WRITER CAME AGAIN MY QUESTION SPECIFIC TO ONE'S ONE'S GOING ON INSIDE IRAQ. THAT'S WHEN I WAS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO LAST WEEK AND THERE WAS A COUPLE OF OUT THERE IN THE MARINO LAND ON THEIR SIDE AND IN THE SIDEWALK AREA. SO AGAIN. DOES IT DOES IT IS IS A TYPE OF OTHER CITY WOULD ASK THAT A SCOOTER LAYING ON ITS SIDE HE RESPONDED -- TO IN IN A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN ONE THAT IS NOT. YES SO AGAIN WE HAVE THAT TORTURE DEVICES SO THAT WE KNOW WRITING. IS LAYING DOWN OUR CITIES AND REQUESTING THAT THOSE. YES THAT THE PART OF IT THAT'S PART OF THIS THE SERVICE WILL AGREEMENT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF A CITY -- IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO GET PEOPLE TO THAT PARTICULAR UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT IS A TYPICAL CITY. ACTOR ASKED THAT THAT BE A PRIORITY. THAT THIS. SAY THAT IN MOST CASES CITIES MAKE SURE THAT SIDEWALK CLUTTER. EIGHTY A ACTION I ANSWER MY QUESTION SO. AGAIN WITH THE SERVICE AGREEMENT. DO CITIES ASK BIRD WHOMEVER IT MAY BE TO THE ASSET SCOOTERS LAYING ON THEIR SIDE MAYBE IN A SIDEWALK. BE PICKED UP AT A HIGHER PRIORITY IN THOSE THAT ARE NOT. LINE ON THEIR SIDE I HAVE YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SPECIFIC. REQUEST BUT I HAVE SEEN THE ISSUE OF SIDELINING THAT'S CITIES NEEDED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW YOU ON EXPECT THAT THEY DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST. DOWNSIDE TO THE MY SCOOTER EXPERIENCE AND FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MY COMMUNITY IS WHEN THEY BECOME A SAFETY HAZARD THANK YOU. YEAH THE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS FREEMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO FINALLY CLOSE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THIS. VERY RAPID GROWTH IN SCOOTERS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THE STEP NOW TO START WITH A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW ALL ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE CONCERNS AND TRY TO GET TO SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW WORKABLE AND WITH ALL. OF OUR CITIES I KNOW THAT I REQUEST AND I BOTH. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER FRIEDMAN -- SURE YOUR INTEREST ENSURING. HI ENSURING SHARES SCOOTERS ARE BEING FAIRLY IN ADEQUATELY REGULATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE IT SHOULD BE CAN YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
