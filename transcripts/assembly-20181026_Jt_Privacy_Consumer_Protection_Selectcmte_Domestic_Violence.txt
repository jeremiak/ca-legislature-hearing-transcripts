here for our a joint committee hearing of assembly select committee on domestic violence and committee on privacy and consumer protection. It's an informational hearing -- On the intersection of domestic violence and technology which was a shocker to me. When not a few months ago we found out that? Well I I guess we don't think that way by project perpetrators do and I'm technology is being used. By to further -- Violate -- Of victims of domestic violence and stole my team and I along with assembly member child decided that this is an important issue that we needed to address. And I want to think -- The city of to argue for hosting us I I have I represent the city of guardian they have been just amazing every time I call. We call for anything they're available something he jumps on of here also I would like to think of family member -- I tell for being here were neighbors we sure on money and I know this is a little bit out of his district five I appreciate the fact that he's here he is the chair of of the our privacy and consumer protection -- Committee and so I think came and if you would like to see an opening remarks sure thank you very much out assembly member Rubio. I'm truly honored to be a part of today's discussion -- Let me start off by thinking also the city of Biloxi for hosting today's the hearing. As well as the California partnership the and the mystic violence the assembly select committee on domestic violence and it's chair -- Chair Rubio for your leadership -- And all of the our committee staff of for their hard work in putting this event together. All domestic violence is a problem that affects millions of people regardless of race gender ethnic groups socio economic status sexual orientation or each. As the chair of the assembly committee on privacy and consumer protection. I'm acutely aware that over the past decade or so we have seen an increase in technology being misused. For to harass and harm individuals. In the privacy committee we deal constantly with issues surrounding emerging technologies. And the opportunities and challenges the section between technology and domestic violence is no exception. Technology has an incredible power to simplify and improve our lives in so many different ways. For example technology can help is better monitor our children's activities. To help keep them safe. Knowledge you can also help is a pain higher education or health care online. Knowledge you can even improve our user experience so very other traditional technologies like phones television. All cars even our air conditioners and toasters. But the advent of social media and smart technologies such as GPS and internet. Connected devices has actually created new avenues for intimate partner harassment and violence. In the legislature because technologies always evolving we are constantly working with advocates and survivors. To make sure that our legal protections keep up keep up with new technologies and new types of abuse. And as a result of these efforts we have successfully updated many of our laws. To ensure that survivors of domestic violence. Are better protected. For example we have ensure that survivors can separate your mobile accounts while still maintaining their existing cell phone numbers. We have also expressly authorize. Hacking into survivors online accounts for the purposes of harming intimidating threatening what the fighting to survive -- We have also enacted laws that require the courts to prohibit even stream party from taking any action to obtain the location or the address of the protective party. Now despite all these efforts it is clear that individuals who inflict harm continues. To misuse technology in the harassment and abuse of others. Gap between the protections we intended. And the on going misuse of technology invested violence cases raises certain questions specifically. Are California's domestic violence prevention lost not being applied as broadly as they might be. In order new laws needed to express. Expressly cover certain abusive behaviors. At the same time what are the best practices being used by organizations both public and private. To ensure that the privacy and security and of individuals are adequately protected. And today I'm hopeful that will get answers to some of those questions. Put another way this technology offer tools that individuals law enforcement and the courts can be used to better protect intimate partners and family members from harassment and abuse. To that end I like to extend a sincere thank you without all of the available information I believe that the legislature will continue to lag behind the miss uses and abuses of a technology. That is why your expertise and experiences are invaluable to us as we grapple with how. Emerging technologies inter act with domestic violence and as we try to ensure that California has the strongest laws possible to protect its residents. Redwood is absolutely crucial to the health and prosperity. Of the residents of the state so with that thank you again for being here and like turn it back over to my colleague assembly member I would be able. Thank you assemblymember telephone I have heard the story many times are we know that domestic violence affects people -- Of all ages races -- Ethnicity gender gender identity sexual orientation in income levels -- There also many ways that survivors experienced abuse and domestic violence including the use of technology and I've shared with many of you. Are the reason that I five to be the chair of the subcommittee on domestic violence with because my sister Susan Rubio. Is a survivor of domestic violence we had a rally in the city of our money yesterday and we had some very compelling -- Testimonials and to be on the other side. Domestic abuse it's very difficult. I spoke about -- My sister's experiences and experience and agregue frankly. This is -- This is the second year of the three year restraining order that she has on her. Abuser and to this day. To the name is a councilman in the city ballpark she's an elected official and currently running -- For state office and there are folks that are saying that she lied about her domestic violence. Say that again. The word is that -- She lied about her time to buy Now. I completely understand why victims of domestic violence don't comport. If somebody. With they such public. Domestic violence -- Case we actually went to court and shipped in a three year restraining order so we have. Evidence. That the judge said that she was a victim of domestic violence. Still people are saying. That she lied and so when that happens. I think about the support that I am able to provide for my sister. And still again to the state. Folks are saying that she lives and so it's difficult. Because she has so much support and I always think about the folks that don't have the amount of support that she does. And the folks there are locked -- Can't do anything about what is happening to them the testimonial from last night was from a mother she said she was going to try to make it. Was from a mother that just lost her daughter five months ago to suicide. She committed suicide because she couldn't handle. The pressure and be the abuse that she wasn't during she left behind two little kids and family members that deeply deeply Dr. Five she felt lost and so the testimonial last night was so compelling -- All compelling but last night was just also a demonstration of where we have not gone far enough to trying to to prevent. Domestic violence. And when we started exploring the topic of cyber bullying -- Domestic by do you I apparently there's and and it's difficult for me because I don't think that way by of the of users are using Alexa. And what I'm not a techie person but the be Abbas on home. Devices. Against their on the victim. By either blasting the music at five o'clock in the morning turning up the air or turned down you know just really. Make it uncomfortable for them and somebody said yeah. Back if you'll plug it they're going to be. Abuse it will come home I'm probably beat them. From playing in the device. We still don't grasp I don't think as a society if we have been through it. On how deep. The control is from a domestic violence abuser and so. It was very appropriate that today we're having this hearing and I want again when the think assembly member town and all of the panelists for being here and hopefully we can. At least. Start a conversation about what is happening and what we can do and I have committed. To to the partnership -- Twentieth to buy men's I'm working on legislation last -- The last two years I've had at least five pieces of legislation -- To help victims of domestic violence. What's to provide emergency housing. To domestic violence victims that are fleeing their situations. Are under the cal works program and we were successful in the governor signed it and I actually heard. From a counselor -- And she sent me a text that said that our bill is making a difference for her clients so I think the partnership for for their support on this and all of the domestic violence -- Organizations that have weighed in on our legislation and then this year's -- Big piece of legislation was to take guns away from -- The perpetrators right now under federal law if you have a domestic violence misdemeanor federal law. You have a lifetime ban on owning a gun. In California it's only a ten year ban. Which out when I saw that I thought to myself my god I got. It California's leading the way and in this particular is. Will come into effect is that any domestic violence misdemeanor. Anybody they have misdemeanor domestic violence is no longer able to own a gun they're banned for life so those are the two big pieces of legislation but I know that there's little fix is that we have been able to accomplish. Big or small a step that we take towards. Hoping domestic violence victims or Iraqi Keating be the the issues of domestic violence is a step forward so I want to thank the panelists again for being here assembly member child. And with that -- I would like to call up our first panel we have -- The it the general introduction and to the intersection of technology technology into that the buy -- One and if we can have -- The first tunnel join us we have. Been St safety net technology specialist -- Specialist national network to end domestic violence. We have -- Christine Smith public policy coordinator California partnership two and that's fine and and the abi guy goes. Legal advocate for human options. Thank you. It's a to that -- We address the intersection of technology and abuse. Providing training and technical assistance to survivors victim advocates state the mystic violence and sexual assault coalitions. Law enforcement court personality turning. Government agency and technology companies. On behalf of safety that founders in the south working or director Eric Olson like to thank you for the opportunity. To appear before you today to address the joint assembly select these concerns. Related to the intersection of the massive amounts of technology. Our members from across the nation including California partnership and the mystic violence United is here today. And the local victim services assistance programs that they work on behalf of are extremely concerned. About the impact of technology misused on victims of domestic violence. To give a number to the enormity of the problem in a national survey conducted in twenty fourteen of local victim service programs. 97% of the victim advocate surveyed reported that abusers women's using technology to stop harassing control that that. That was in. Twenty fourteen it's speaks highly of your state figure carefully considering this complex issue in contemplating policy development to help enhance protections and increase victimization. Today I want to open with the story and I ask that you keep in mind that well it's just one story it offers a good -- At the toll technology misuse has on the physical emotional and economic well being of countless survivors. A few weeks ago and they can reach out to our team and I took the call. Over the course of a few years this person gone back to school had gotten a degree while working full time. And working a full time job I apparently. She just been hired to a new position -- At a small firm in her field and start date was set for three weeks out. Two weeks left she got a call from the owners of the company they run at a second post higher search of her name on Google. Something standard in their And I discovered numerous social media posts with her name and photograph and very rude accusations -- So been made on a personal page of someone she briefly dated. She didn't know about the post until the employer call. Has a position she'd been hired to fill was public facing. They told her that. That they had to put her hiring on hold it might not be able to bring her on if the posted not going down. She contacted the technology companies and five opposed to be taken down. And unfortunately they were carefully crafted in a way that did not violate the terms of service of the social networks. But they were good enough for the company to reconsider their offer. The technology companies responded to her report saying. We reached out to our contacts at the companies. And asked them to reconsider nope an impact on her employment. Came down but the abusive person posted Morley content on other sites. For over two weeks we play this game of whack a mole the abuser would post something she would find it and report it we reach out to the company requesting that opposed to be removed. Explaining the harm they were causing. And unfortunately the abuse tactics. Used ended in the worst and the company withdrew. survivors experiences a second use -- offer minimum we'll tell right isn't really Senate harassment and precedent for I will say some in fact it is story straight is not it is now and has in fact because it is a consequences really and I was a little the Senate there's so many reasons persons that time the level of confidence as the final Sir hello this is example -- misused technology in a number of a easily share and and it is for years courses they have played this is also a special song live stream for the status modernist offices rely on anything allergy where my reaction automation tools that is turning on lights and radios and televisions on -- mostly surprised because they feel that they are in for their lives hello seventy five dollars people just because doesn't seem possible in some cases they literacy asking because yeah maybe yeah on the other side of the spectrum we hear from others to do it Houston on the state's latest technologies and a half from the US being online or saying this again is this like right now -- it is usually -- hello this is possibility should be here and is a thousand writers have already he said -- this is a life free from harassment pieces -- uses office systematically stripped away actually financial resources and saying on smartphones email social media access to the last for heating service lifeline technology is our last the person who uses yeah platform not solution access to technology will not be there technology disabilities these we used to have just consider the so should we consider -- technologies to someone else's thirty five hours a week by disconnecting the survivor and cutting off access technology companies do have Her appointment I for it's just The writer [inaudible] Where [inaudible] Results. Right right. Are socially -- There's a your bill off on someone else. Three five our right. Yeah right yeah -- Run and they're less likely. We often hear used. It's time that we also that. We recognize that this is a very complex issue. Maybe there's one nation reason I don't see anything about. Only say he's. Three billion is. I am interested in. Yeah. This is -- This is [inaudible] Yeah [inaudible] Shop [inaudible] Two folks. Online and I want to point out that you are correct. Action is willing get awfully. Easier for us [inaudible] To to right [inaudible] The last. And are directing the perpetrators spot so I want to thank you for for that. Berman Rubio tenants have been Q. burger my testimony today. My name is Christine met with the California partnerships and enough to balance. The partnership is the state by domestic violence coalition representing over two hundred organizations several which you'll hear from today. Organizations their plastic found survivors their families and communities all across California and there are public policy communications. Building efforts we line prevention and intervention strategies. And social change. We believe the by Shane expertise. Advocates and policymakers can and the massive violence. The partnership is also a member of the national network to end domestic violence. We work closely with them on a range of issues including confidentiality. Privacy and the intersection of domestic violence and technology. When a direct service organization reaches out to me for assistance on this intersection? This eighteen eighteen is the first resource I time. To an earlier this year Corbin presented a very and for me. According to the California women's health survey approximately 40% of California women experience physical intimate partner once in their lifetime. An estimated five point. Seven five point seven million California women and men experience intimate partner violence each year. In many cases a portion of this abuse instability debt by technology. The example here throughout today's hearing provided look at this pervasive in a section. Well technologies will in facilitating appears it's important to understand and address. We must also remember that at the core are the issues of power and control that are at the root of all domestic violence. Whether technology is used or not. A server from northern California asked me to share her story with the own. Six months to a year. Operating from a physically abusive partner. She was hanging out with her friends and a male friend walked in his face a mixture of panic and pity. And said have you seen Facebook. Her her think any side he's added again. She frantically turn on her laptop. Open. And saw the naked at the top half of her body. Based on all. Day about her. The wrong twenty words written all of them. The naked photos were unflattering. Nothing even flattering photos would have been okay but it felt like salt in the wound to see the photos that were never okay to be used in this manner. She did not agree to the photos they were taken without her consent. After shout when she's reaching for a towel -- Perpetrator with Y. as he took the photo. And laughed again when she protested the removed the post. Embarrassed he didn't even begin to describe it. The posts were made from social media accounts created in her name the hydrant at her friends. And other posts were made and her perpetrators seem and somewhere made with you don't names. When she started a new job a single mom of a toddler at the time? Learning and living life in the aftermath of physical abuse. Email began being sent to her new boss. Security and other employees the company with pictures comments and warnings. Not to trust the for she didn't find out about this until after almost a year after working there. When the security guard hardly mentioned that? Wishing means never and in between us her perfect figure. The teacher looked at all the photos. Posted. And tax and informed her that because she was married. The photos with the property of her perpetrator and for future reference it would really be better not to take photos without her clothes on she was far too ashamed to even begin to explain but she did not confess the photos. She didn't have the self esteem at the time to get not officer for blaming her. And looking at the photos to determine that there was no crime when he could have determined not without an additional person looking at these photos. Eventually the postdocs. To learn about way she could feel safe online. She had information about herself and never posted publicly in. Eight years later she has only started to make some post public. Several years after her experience she thought that laws were passed making this activity criminal. It was too late to her but she hopes the others I hope by the five thank you for hearing my testimony say in a line need to show the survivor story with the the partnership is a resource for domestic violence programs. And also the California legislature as we work together to and enough to balance. Thank you very much. The the problem she stopped posting. Because and she found weights. Keep proposed secrets again. But being is that the victims are are forced to be the ones to ask so that they are not victimized again. Thank you for that I appreciate it -- And then also next -- We have a new be guided those legal advocate for human options. Walk thank you hi good morning everybody I'm yeah the valuables and leave it with him and options Constantine. Also support tell support immigration -- But today I'm here to talk about the economy and how I see with my clients when they are disclosing. That there is some type of technology if you. So a few months ago I actually had a nine and her name is going to be Mario we're going to change the name. And Maria came to me because she actually wanted to know about divorce she had been married to her husband for about fifteen to twenty years. And she finally decided that she wanted it and the relationship legally she had been separated for a few months and they had been living in separate homes but she wanted to officially do it legally. So I've been legal advocate in our intake we actually asked several questions. And always ask privacy questions some clients actually don't know they're being stock. And and it's I think it's fair to say I sometimes don't even know how to use my iPhone and I can look with technology so for someone that's older that probably can operate within all the G. or maybe we are just aren't tech savvy. We don't think that someone is capable of stopping us through our phone -- So while I was doing the privacy assessment. She started saying that no he's not stalking me -- But when she started talking about the abuse she actually started to talk about how. He sometimes pop in locations where she was. And not rose a red flag told what does that mean -- So she started saying that when she was having dinner with a friend. Every now and then she was seated pick truck parked in the parking lot. And he wouldn't get out from his truck he would just stay there and the first time he thought well maybe this is coincidence may. Following her from our house to the restaurant and he never did. So when she met with me I actually educated her about hacking softwares I can be installed on your phones and they can be used to track you to monitor your whereabouts. During the American during her relationship when they used to live together he actually monitored everything she did and she had to report to him. Where she was at what time she was going to come back? And when she got home she had to call him from a land line so she needs so he knew that she was home -- So we started talking we started safety I mean and IT review resources. Actually gave review resources from the national network to end domestic violence. And she became more. He thought maybe I am in stock do my phone and I started asking her she have a GPS location on at all times she said yes they don't know how to turn it off I thought your phone comes like that. So I educated her on how to turn off your GPS location how to adjust your settings but a really encouraged her to speak out how by the tech agencies. On which I'm glad he did when he did more research she actually started researching on you. To double the cost and video on YouTube that actually teaches hackers hot hot. But it also teaches you how to know if your phone attack. On a she was able to do the status and if perform with happy at the end of message will pump on your phone same. If your phone was hacked what with the hacker able to see. Well the message came up and shoot at that moment me that her husband was able to read her text messages. Was able -- I immediately told your go to agency where they do tax so they can see what's offer it is to be can remove it and how you can -- If you want to press charges what type of evidence do you eat. So she ended going back to eighteen T. where he purchased her phone and they were too they were able to a sister. They ended up helping her figure out what type of South Korea was they took it out of her phone -- Make up the evidence and I am unsure if she ever did press charges. But he came back to me one last session to close her file and when she did she was very grateful. That instead of us telling her stop using your device. ID with the tools and education. For her to actually reach out for it to individuals that knew how to work the technology world -- And guide her so that way she can use the device and continue with your daily routine. But now she does it in a safe manner and now she knows where she can go if she ever needed for the house. Thank you so much for having today. Thank you I hope world taking notes because I think -- You know the information that we're receiving is again mind. Boggling to me to know that people go to those lengths -- I would not have the you know where to begin thank you for the you. To reference by. You know kids today are. Are you too bye all the time -- But it doesn't occur to me that all of this can you know B. and be -- Picked up. To Christine in your in your scenario the did the victim actually report the incident to the authorities. On or the court for that matter. Follow it with a quick about it to her but he told her that it wasn't friends. Because he was because the perpetrator with her husband and her husband taking the photos of her. I see I I know that we have a penal code that actually addresses that that that particular situation is called because Cannella movie -- Law in a co six forty seven but but I'll be happy to look into a little bit more -- Because of that relationship to spousal relationship. To see we need to fine tune the law as well on is worth hacking situation is concerned there's in fact I did it I did a bill all on packing -- Anti hacking also of AB. One five I wonder if dot also would address that particular situation but all out also investigate -- As to cordon situation -- And they were receptive and generally what we'll do we get requests from survivors who have been flat things and they're not taking taken down by the company. That will will look through the terms of service ourself fine but if we can. Point to eat. Reach out for the company point to some of the harness being because and and escalate done -- And sometimes having a voice in the next helps because we do work with them on a regular basis around the development of technology. So as they're releasing -- New products or software or policies -- A lot of times the work that we do with them is. To take those or release analyze them provide feedback on how someone might issues that are might be harmed by it -- So they they've been very receptive the hope the hope is that technology of as the design. Of it within the design process they'll be a proactive prevention based -- Model -- Adopted for the future that doesn't work. You know we'll do legislation others to do the needed but if they're these companies are willing you know on their own to do. To get you know -- Accepted your input I think that may be a good sign right good conversation [inaudible] Thank you. Something. To our panel to a frost she's from the theater of riverside county sheriff's department -- List he direct [inaudible] Yes and researcher at the university of South Irvine Thank you very much [inaudible] And welcome [inaudible] Yeah -- New technology turn. Thank you to the chair persons and committee for the committees excuse me for having here today actually didn't prepare a written statement simply because I like to react to what I hear everybody's -- Saying in the room -- Initially let me -- Say that -- In terms of what Christine was speaking about in regards that revenge porn cases and it to me like that occurred. Probably before twenty thirteen or twenty fourteen when that law was passed -- As a please someone give you background on myself real quickly -- On the master investigator which just means I get paid a little bit more -- Been around longer time. I've been a detective -- For probably about fifteen years a police officer for nineteen years. Prior to that I was a reporter and a newspaper journalist. So I have somewhat of an interesting take. On training etcetera I believe training is actually are solution to a lot of what we're talking about here today. And I some things ninety quickly that not only does domestic violence affect the victims that we are here talking about today. But didn't mystic violence suspects are often times the people who are committing mass homicide. Targeted by once it's set or in our community. Strangulation cases and more so we've combined knows because one of the things that we see it riverside county sheriff's. Is that we have a lot of silo effect going on we have different agencies working on different projects and different programs and not everybody's working together and talking together -- We do have a lot of laws on the books and I wrote down a few of them -- Just in case I forgot all the sub sections -- But I would like to start with simply saying that. You know police officers want to do the right thing. The majority of us obviously we can get into this because we love the money -- We got into this because we want to help people. But we are we need to be Jack of all trades. And we have vehicle codes penal codes health in institutions goes well for an institution code and so on and so on and then we are master of what we choose. So a lot of people choose to get be masters and drugs and gangs and homicide in all that sexy stuff. And some of us choose to become masters and domestic violence and threats. So when I go back to that kind what we're talking about we have to seventy three point six which is a restraining order law -- We fail so often is law enforcement go to recognize that we're actually looking at six forty six point nine subsection a and B. are stalking laws. Two instances of addressing repeatedly following tracking it cetera and a credible threat. Because we have lost along the way the concept of training our officers what credible threat really means. In the olden days if you will for twenty two PC which is our criminal threats. Credible threat. Was identified as someone being right in front of you with the immediate ability to commit the act at that moment [inaudible] Now. We train our criminal threat. If we're talking on online are we right there at that moment. That I we're not. So a lot of people I think maybe have a misunderstanding about our online bullying and threatening its center believes because a long time ago the courts actually dress with Brett actually it. If a reasonable person would feel threatened in that circumstance. Then it's a threat so its course of conduct. So we have stock month we have a restraining order laws we have -- Five oh two which is our hacking and computer data law for getting into people's emails etcetera. Everything we've been talking about today there's a law that exist me to do something about it which is great. But there are definitely places where we can improve -- We could use some stronger sentences in or surfaced you skews me stronger requirements in our probation sentencing -- Once we have domestic on subjects are sentenced and access to their phones and right now we have limited access to their phones. It's great to talk about how much of the technology companies help us but as a police officer sometimes a little difficult for me -- I love apple I have tons of apple products get me wrong and many great your apple just in case you're watching that is a can to basically. Allowing them to testify against himself I can't however get them to give me their fingerprint. Do I need not open this phone. Anybody who knows your phone off when you have to put in. Your password. So I can't compelling about it give me that I can maybe not even get into the perpetrators devices to see what's going on to see what computer technology debuts -- I think when we talk about training it's not just training police officers. It's train all of us together. Like you said it's your not that's accepted. Okay I'm not super tech savvy sorry apple I'm not. Having -- But there are people who are so we could definitely use more technical assistance centers. That could work with law enforcement and work with our victims we have those around the country right now and I believe that partnering with the family justice centers. Would be a fantastic to do that we have been we just centers throughout the United States throughout the world frankly. And be able to use that a foundational area for all of the things we're talking about here I think is great because all the advocacy programs can work with them. All law enforcement to work within the district attorney's offices etcetera etcetera -- So one of the things that I I I see that we're talking a lot about different wars remote smart home devices. However we can also use those to protect our victims. Using remote smart home devices is actually wonderful thing. Having access to that which we've actually obtained access to some of those voter victim of crime application utilizing some of those monies to help put in. Smart home devices for alarm systems Lazar victim to take a peek at her house where his house before they don't. To see someones at my door. We are bring technology that's out there right now not and I'm probably using a brand name I apologize again not as six seven that allows us to see. Rings are durable and to actually answer them. As if we were inside the house. But it really is about. Everyone getting on the same page all of this there it's locked changes additions etcetera -- We need federal. To be online the state to be online with local. And for advocates and our police officers to be working together. Multi disciplinary teams I feel are so often the solution to so many of the issues that we are facing. And if we have the availability to train our officers who want to do a good job. This is how you care of this case. They want to do it but just as many people in here are tech savvy I'm a huge believer grant. Grants and grant programs to develop -- Rooms like ago throughout our state. We are work on and off the violence against women Zakaria we started one of the first threat management teams in the state. For an entire county wide. And we did that because of the we don't do great. Now if we wanted to go out and train on technology and I provide free training across the United States simply because of the B. W. grant. I'm able to talk about now come aside strangulation training people and things they've never heard before or talked about before. Especially not in the context of those who commit mass homicide are often actually Stranglers. So if we never look at that before encouraging people to look at those cases and letting our officers no hate alive Stranglers also happen to kill police officers. Which gives them a lot of interest in that as well. Too so as we talk about all this and I can go out and do all the training. Think of what our officers and advocates and community agencies could do if we grant money. To develop training on technology. And to develop assistance centers great and work. From a law enforcement perspective -- It just took us awhile to figure out how to work with it -- For anybody who doesn't know what I'm talking about the California electronic communications privacy act basically says that especially as a law enforcement officer. If I'm going to go look into somebody's phone I have. To look specifically into certain sections and tell during my thank you and tell during my search weren't exactly what I need to look into that section before was basically I have this phone. I have the phone. Now it's great for victims because I'm gonna look at a victim stone she can give me just permission to look at this part this part in this part. So if you want to share with law enforcement what's going on in your situation you can provide this information to to me. And I won't look at stuff maybe you don't want to see or maybe a barrister concerned about. His people should feel comfortable. Coming in law enforcement not a free to come along for some -- But from a suspect perspective I need to work just a little bit harder in order to determine where it can go in that phone. And that's fine we can do that but that's also part of that train so we'd love to be able to bring thank you can click. Here and next we have. Founder and executive director of ongoing excellence Hello everyone. I'm lives leave founder and executive director of online SO us online also last week as a nonprofit organization and we provide resources to individuals and journalists. Who have been targeted and threatened online who are dealing with online harassment? And similar to detect the frost I was hoping to start to treat this as a conversation at the beginning of the conversation really built on the perspectives and questions everyone has brought to the table so far. Before that I'm happy to give a little bit of an introduction about myself. So -- When I graduated from college from the university of Pennsylvania with honors I moved back to New York City to start my first job in finance? And I was so excited. I was green I was ready to take on the world. When I was actually small threatens and extorted online? Aspen escalated to my apartment door being kicked in by my stalker -- Consider contacting law enforcement and ultimately didn't I considered getting a restraining order but I couldn't because I didn't know initially who it was [inaudible] And you know I've. Shared my I probably share my story every day through my work but one thing I don't share actually often and never in a public setting is. That I did find out who. Was behind the harassment -- Through an I. P. address match this is almost a decade ago -- And so I was on ask Jeeves dot com one had existed -- To figure out how to get to the bottom of what was going on and it was my ex partner. And the reason my ex boyfriend and the reason I go and that that will impact how on how my credibility is viewed -- But in addition to the stocking and extortion there were threats to distribute my intimate images to my employer -- And my parents [inaudible] And as a high functioning independent fairly credible person. I still. Hi this challenges documenting what was going on and what I later learned in doing this work on online harassment is. Well their neurological changes that happen in when you're in a state of emotional distress. And so what I want and how that has led me to this work I do this work I quit my job at Morgan Stanley three years ago to start online SO us. Because I saw the in the new cycle. Individuals coming forth about what was happening to them right sometimes this issue feel so expansive it's hard to get our arms around what's really going on you know the cross section between domestic violence media disinformation impersonation all of the staff. To it is very clear that only her Austin's a massive problems And people are committing suicide as a reaction to online harassment [inaudible] And I couldn't. I could I have to stop playing small behind my cubicle and start sharing not only the human story but what could be done. And so when we start online SLS that we first provided free direct service including mental health services from a professional -- To anybody dealing with online her. We've since of all all to providing information tactless resources on what people can do when they need help -- And building on the third to frustrate you were sharing about training. And law enforcement one to do the right thing but it's sometimes unclear. We talk even today about multiple tactics. So one of the things that I wanted to offer today was. The importance of the specifics. About the audience the constituents the issue that they're dealing with which sometimes it's multiple tactics. But really -- Be specific about what kind what someone access to us moving forward. Figuring out if we are funding online harassment or developing grants around that exactly what type of toxics will it go. To because we're at a point where the narrative platforms aren't doing enough law enforcement isn't doing enough that is not actually productive. Because and hoping. People in crisis we realize they won't report done because that narrative has been so pervasive. And if they won't report them we want to really understand what they're dealing with what's going on and so. I wanna be mindful of time and I have many things to say. But I think that really is my own take. Away from this discussion. And building on what was said so far really. At the intersection of task. Media politics. Law enforcement law. Now more than ever it's critical we come together. All the efforts and coalition building and being specific and getting understanding specific use cases. And then working towards change. I believe is the pathway. So thank you so much for your time and look forward to continuing this discussion further. Just one comment -- Those about what you're saying about the harassment online -- I we are public officials and we've had several incident -- Instances lately where we're being harassed but it's very easy to hide behind the keyboard nobody can -- You know really hold you accountable for for those. Are is the perception of that nobody's gonna hold Burke countable for for you doing the cyber stalking. Are in my case again a public official so that's really the laws are very different -- By my fast at the look at the comments the look at the comments. Because they were very very rude rude and I mean to the point where -- They would they literally had to like not let me look at the company -- By I have -- The the ability to call upon you know we have -- The CHP that takes care of the assembly members we have a tech that we call them sergeants and at the capital that we can call and they're doing a security assessment of our offices. So we have access to that and for folks that don't have access I want to thank you for for providing that access -- Because like I said we are have the access button most people don't and it's very easy. For the perpetrator to just hide behind their first amendment rights really isn't there talking [inaudible] Taking the I will. Being attacked or savings that aren't kind to others needs to also be address because I think we've developed this culture that it's like a wall. You know if I'm online so it's okay and it really is and so again thank you -- For conversation today and then so now we have a cat low researcher at UC Irvine thank you and welcome. Yeah -- Yeah underserved track university help Irvine and my background is both a technical issue logical -- Intriguing and I work as a consultant interested safety which is typically you know issues relating to harassment -- And so I've been able to sort of work and see these issues from inside the companies as well as doing. Crisis support facilitation for a target to the views and harassment. Of which came out of me running on link use for women who found themselves being targets and have the resources at all -- And so after aggregating enough resources we realized -- Well I guess we should if is a resource we should start you know Sir deliberately helping people -- And so. After doing that work for a while the prices were great I realized that I wanted to see the inside of companies and why these decisions are being made. About how these platforms for for being designed just from the stock or from. Across platforms and they you know reported it on every platform and none of them got you know they don't know who the actions. And in what I realized is -- As she started crying at some point I was I was going through this with her and like -- No I am so sorry this is really difficult I understand you would know I'm crying out of happiness because I thought it was going crazy. Because the way that these platforms would consistently denied these reports -- Was sort of a form of like what people say plating is you know sort of imposing a different reality on on of the experiences of of this type of harassment -- And so. This isn't actually a single story this is a several dozen stories you know over the that have happened over and over over the past. Year and a half. Year and a half alone is -- When I with somebody who And please [inaudible] She had we actually documented like here shoes very savvy engineer to do to document everything but when she went to the police station they had no idea what to do with it and they just turned her away -- And she had no idea what to do at that she had no means like shouldn't know try to go to a lawyer. A and there's no guidance there -- And so. You know and they basically said like you know just up online which is sort of a common refrain. That doesn't actually work given that. You know it's a very important for both here professional and social life to do that -- And in many cases to be connected to your support when you have a an abuser. A and and this is becoming a worse problem there's a two thousand seventeen survey by a cue. That documented in increase in people who have and severely harassed online which includes like sexual harassment. Stalking and doctor thing and they demonstrated that where there's a particular rise -- Or a particularly high point for a younger generation people between eighteen and twenty five so it's it's been getting worse it of younger people as well. Specially. And and so speaking from the side of working within companies -- There actually are many challenges and many many of the people who work on the trust and safety team that time companies are. Very good and very well intentioned people who do have a lot of education -- But there are a lot of attention with privacy for example the challenges you know how do we increase. Does the gathering information that can be useful for a healthy these cases without creasing surveillance that can be used by -- State actors known bad faith -- Internationally or locally. You know being abused by hackers and other kinds of compromises and and the security of data. And so. You know a lot of teams are kind of stock in there also under resource. And so one of the things that I see is that that I think there can be some changes in in the tech industry is that there right now there's very limited escalation infrastructure. In the sense that if you have a severe case you know it it's very difficult to get escalate. The systems by these companies are designed to be one size fits all so you know in there moderation their huge scalable commercial content moderation systems. They basically a limited amount contact they feel like you know the text of the thing that was reported. And in isolation a lot of the time it doesn't look that bad -- But in aggregate and of being far far worse and so there's very little interest. And I think that if there are more resources -- Allocate to a more pressure around this kind of escalation that these kind of prophecies. Of for escalation I think that. Would go a great way towards addressing these issues with severe abuse and harassment -- And so. Right now -- There's some there are a few partnership with the many partnership serving former tech companies -- That are you know NGOs non profits -- And I've had to see that -- Advocacy organizations out but right now there's limited integration you know -- These organizations see very. Little into the operations of these tech companies. And a very little agency to do very much about that so I think having more way behind the amount of insight of and participation they can happen that process is very important -- There's some precedents for dealing with this -- Plot have had to build system for dealing with child exploitation -- Materials alongside government agents and some social media platforms of invested more training and resources. For individuals and specialists who actually dig into the context. Are so that they can sort of identifies movies more severe cases of abuse. And so. The recommendations that I would I wanted to point out is one is one is what not to do is. A common response is removing and identity right at you know making it difficult to have an anonymous user names and things like that. But it is not actually very effective solution and actually pulls back from the protections that people have -- To avoid abuse so being anonymous allows you to escape your user and it's been a common practice to have a fake name on Facebook. Stay connected to your support network while avoiding your views there however that violates Facebook's policy. And I get taken down and often does when the of users find out -- About if if they find out about that account. So. Really going back to what is we need their infrastructure prophecies. Of both in the relationship between law enforcement agencies and these platforms -- These escalation form of escalations along side -- Advocacy organizations -- And I think. The end and actually -- Along to get technical experts to and actually your point before the technical experts in. Of law enforcement agencies to do that kind of education so that people know what to do with these social media -- Records -- And what with all the law and with all that documentation. And online platforms typically rely on target to abuse to actively advocate for themselves and actively report -- But a lot numerous studies over the past couple years have a demonstrate about. How targeted views choose not to report after a period of time because of lack of trust the platform or fear of? Retaliation -- And often don't understand how best report and how that abuses even being perpetrated in the first place so having more proactive means to identify and reach out to targets even to confirm if this is actually happening to them -- It would be really important because right out of many social media policies. Of require that people report first. Aye and and I think one of the biggest threats to severe -- Serve targets of severe on harassment of of severe online harassment have been data brokers. As a data brokers are -- Well of the workers are websites aggregate public and private information where you get it there like white pages dot com and studio we can pay to get. Somebody at yeah address family members and everything and so these these websites -- Third dozens and dozens of popular ones that prop profit off of compromising the privacy of citizens. And the that aggregating information and in all of the same location and making it accessible does decrease the effect of privacy. Of a citizen and especially of a target of abuse -- It works fine about it in my experience is that is easy information is often quickly updated after you move after you take your contact information. So a lot of the measures that we used to protect people don't work because of these data brokers -- You can remove a lot of information but it cost you between a hundred fifteen five thousand dollars from services and you don't know which ones are active. So and it it it is well known as a mod reviews among -- Forms online and it's very easy to find out about. So what what I to the rock hall of of for time it is important focus on technical education for long forces. Law enforcement of prophecies escalate harassment cases resource allocation for trust and safety measures -- And more integrated partnerships with advocacy orders not just having a partnership -- And I think and and again working on well how do you address data brokers had we address that this is an easy way to profit -- And is not a regulated in any significant way -- And so I think it's important not just a center best practices and design prophecies and education so that they can of all along side how these technologies are changing. In the way that they knew harassment and how her after learning more sophisticated techniques and strategies more easily. Thank you thank you. For the we have -- Questions or comments I. S. C. assembly member -- Tower -- Figures being over here I see a couple bills coming. Onto the privacy committee I can I can feel it. And I would be honored to partner with you on some of those so I'm putting it out there are. So think you if there's no other questions I want to thank the panel I appreciate -- You and we look forward to working together so that we can assist assembly member town was built. Thank you yes. I just. Wanted to add one thing in a couple resources so the first is another interesting place to look could be evidence preservation. So the challenges of evidence relation on the target -- And what kind of evidence. Do we need to provide law enforcement or to the platform. And then there the first is -- Without my consent. And nonprofit organization -- Focused on actually analyzing California domestic violence related law has a domestic violence restraining order digital. Chichi. And so. I think it's a great place to look and direct people direct folks. To and then there's been a couple recent reports that you may -- That could be helpful to draw from. So the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women just published a report -- In June. Around -- How online violence well as amnesty and a group called a troll busters with the international women's media foundation -- On how. This affects female journalists. Just wanna share by -- As places to draw from the future thank you. If you very much I appreciate the conversation. Thank you. Next up we can we have personal story and the use of technology in the message violence I'd like to welcome our third panel out -- Jasmine Montero's on people department manager Lara's health and Jack month NARAL home -- Social service manager at so he re justice center. Up [inaudible] Yeah [inaudible] Welcome. Okay so high everyone many jobs and Montrose and want to thank the committee for having me here today -- So I am bill people to the manager at Lawrence house. So Lara's houses the nonprofit agency that services victims of intimate partner violence -- Wearable cafe you can process -- Ensuring that nobody is alone or unprepared the day after hearing -- So this year we're going to support nearly twelve hundred victims -- Through this process many of them have experience and to report to us that they have been experiencing some type of technology abuse -- Added peace twelve hundred victims would say roughly about Have reported some type of kind of you know technology abuse -- In different ranges so kind of the reason for family going to a personal story about a client and kind of what we did to help them with the technology issues that they were experience. But we do believe that victims of intimate partner violence or people in domestic violence relationships are at higher risk -- Of the perpetrator gaining and using this abuse against them the reason for this is because they're just not some stranger who's trained target somebody at random -- It's somebody that the trusted at some point somebody who might know their personal information so this gives the perpetrator access to their devices. Access to knowing their personal security questions to be able to answer certain things for them -- And that puts their devices. To use -- So with that a compromised device that the compromised accounts can give the perpetrator access to the locations are track the tracking their their whereabouts. So from that they're able to sometimes reader text messages listen in on conversations even access their voice mails. As well as sometimes even remotely delete evidence from their computers are the phones -- That they might be using for this restraining order hearing that we're going to be assisting them with -- So with that I do want to talk about one specific client that comes to mind when we talk about technology -- For the purpose of the story let's go ahead and call -- Thirteen so dean came to us she had already petitioned for a restraining order. And when she got what she had. A stock of evidence -- And it was. Screenshot -- In just personal information on her social media accounts school change. She just didn't understand why she would go back change this password but the pass which just capital change back with accounts that. Kept getting access into. So with that we worked with her on resetting the password to her accounts but at the end of the day did she didn't feel safe. With the devices because she was already doing this so we work with her and do some research on these accounts -- But at the same time. While she was worried about her social media and online account she was also. Going to her local grocery stores she was going to a local Starbucks and her perpetrator would appear at these locations. So there was. Too much going on at once that she decided to kind of take herself off line and but the beast was still there yes talking. So access those are garage door and she turns to her car and she sees. A typical little yellow brag sticking out of the grill of the car. She went towards the car. Took out that yellow right that was there and wrapped inside that yellow rod. Was that I phone. The iPhone was connected to her car battery. And came to the conclusion not from this aye full he was using the find my location. Probably had a software on there to be able to track where she was and this was the reason why he was showing up at every location that she was not. Whether it be the grocery store at the local Starbucks -- So with that she didn't team it's safe to the touch the phone from a car right battery in that moment still she waited a little bit -- Eventually after doing some safety parting with advocates -- We were able to go ahead and remove that before one of her hearing -- But at the end of the day. It was the question how we need the court was going to answer the question how do you know. That it's this person that fooled the cities tortilla -- Luckily with hers that was a really easy solution because the very first thing perpetrators email address on there. So. That was an easy case but at the end of the yeah I think it comes down to you know meeting with the client so when we met with her we assisted her in helping our children passwords -- We also did research on her account -- But everything still kept getting changed back so. After with last week partner actually with a local cybersecurity company and I feel that back something that is very beneficial. To advocates and agencies work. None of us had any. Knowledge of what was going on with tech because we're not tax ID some of us might be some of us might not be. But we have a local cybersecurity company actually come and do some extensive training with us and teaching us what fishing was what. Hacking is and we actually got a full expense knowledge and we created helpless to be able to provide to our clients. And showing them and actually determining if their phone a safer unsafe -- So with her specifically we actually helped her -- Reese -- Completely your first and this is work we did with her -- Because she had tried going to police and they would be like but how do you know it's this person doing this when she would children screenshots on everything bloom Chiu -- But that we did the factory resets with her and from there we work in educating her on the site where -- Applications that were out there to try to maintain her devices safe -- From not once everything was done eventually she did come back online she alone here in California all her family was out of state and our communication was to face the with everybody else -- But without we also educated her on how to keep her account see from here on out -- And if we wouldn't of had this chain personally I think it would have been a little bit harder for us to prepare for it to continue on with her life and feeling safe. Our social media accounts on the internet -- So we educated her on the two factor authentication and on a password reset feel not just specifically what's your laptop when somebody can go on to your profile I just find your high school in the know your mascot. So we did this education portion with her -- From there the client did end of obtaining her restraining order and eventually criminal case was open but it wasn't in regards. To the happy it was in regards to everything else it was because of the violations that were happening in the restraining order and him showing up at these locations. But from there -- Center they're telling me that she's doing great nobody has been going into her counsel she actually feel safe on the internet out -- But with that. I think some tools. That we often see with our clients one of the most challenges is going to be. You know being able to tie this evidence to vote of users -- For example I know one time I was in court and there was somebody that actually worked in law enforcement trying to obtain a restraining order and they have all the resources they were showing I. P. address as they were showing. How they knew it was the perpetrator versus somebody that comes to you know -- And a local agency we have access to resources but it tends to be limited at times so we try to do as much as we can with -- Even try to find with us it's great that we have this partnership where we can actually even communicate with them and after moved on the full assessment. If it's still not safe will send the device over to the city -- Cybersecurity company but a lot of agencies and people that are doing this on their own don't have access to these things -- But I really think it comes down to being. Providing that education portion to advocates to local law enforcement. To anybody possible to try. To let them know how once to the internet and to have to take all these precautions. Because at the end of the day. Why should they have to do this even though? The abuses occurring -- But with that so. I just wanted to say thank you for having me as a before allowing me to show my experience with claims. Thank you rate on next to her. Job [inaudible] Q. -- Thank you for the opportunity to give my statement and a little about the intersections on domestic violence that knowledge and immigration -- And the new grand experience as we start moving towards solutions I think is important to also. Take into consideration that different community access technology differently. My name is judgment I and I'm the social services program manager with the taxi just a center. In my row at the diary I oversee the social services program as well as support survivors with case management counseling and referrals. I first are working with immigrant survivors of domestic violence in two thousand and five and have since work in both east and west the center is a national nonprofit the uses holistic approach providing legal. And social services representation for immigrants undocumented immigrants victims off gender based violence. We also do public education and advocacy. Our mission is to protect courageous immigrant women and girls who refused to be victims of violence by elevating their voices in your communities. Courts and Congress. 71% of to hurry clients have experienced domestic violence. Nearly half have also experienced a very different forms of abuse. Immigrant women are tK times more likely to experience domestic violence and the general public. 72% of abusive partners fail to give there's thousands of legal status any use that as a tool of control. One out of five better immigrant women site immigration consequences at the fear reason for leaving the adhesive relationship. It is also important to recognize the domestic violence among immigrant and refugee populations are not rooted in the specific cultures. But in part Cherokee and oppression. In addition they immigration experience is often Rio in violent. Abuse extortion and the different forms of trauma. Post immigration stressors can have impact in family dynamics and create the conditions for a domestic violence with a immigrant and refugee population. Leadership thank the Grayson process -- Is impacted by many factors. In kicking can call socialize the isolation limited English a language proficiency can limited access to resources and when we talk about -- Language access is important to also that to talk about it is not just about. Foreign languages and English technology itself is the language I sometimes a struggle with. Some off the terms that we had been using here so that's something that we have. To take into consideration as well when doing -- Community outreach -- We also most of most observe how institutions and systems off technology are rooted in privilege. I first learned about the term she's you know divide. On a study conducted by the center for justice Lawrence and community at the university of California Santa Cruz. They thirty highlighted how access and use of technology tends to zero social economic disparities. And those disparities my further reduce opportunities for immigrants to adopt technological skills. Another thirty conducted by the university of southern California foundation grants have a higher ownership of mobile device. The lower for computer and internet access per household. Latino immigrants also have the lowest rate of computer ownership for household -- When compared to white US born Latinos and Asian immigrants? Latinos on the computer. Another thirty conducted in By the welcome center the welcome center for the new Pennsylvania. Found that when it comes to immigrants personal use of social media. Texting has an overwhelming prevalence 95% of the respondents reported using their mobile phones to send text message. If this number is significantly higher than the percentage of US adults -- Cellphone users that overall is about 73%. More than half 58% say that they do so often and those who say they never sent that. Text messages were all -- Eight all forty or older forty years old or older. In that same parking demographic to keep in mind when you are working with folks from different ages and backgrounds. We also see clients where children are the ones support their parents with the communications via text or electronic devices. This is something the provider should consider when communicating with clients doing outreach or also thinking on different like. Ways to use evidence -- Or communicate with clients. As expected many immigrants use social media to communicate with their support systems back home -- responded on their report. Say they use mobile phones for the show the nine one stop. However the general knowledge of self when you use seems to state limited to those applications -- We work with clients that although they use Facebook Daly what's that daily when we have to talk about different safety deep so different. Technological applications so you get is that can help then they need some additional support in that area -- Is my limited to communication. Are we still have a long way to go when it comes. To our community education on technology and technology access itself -- But he can be a pearl out process -- We can do some safe work towards safety improvement. And also on evidence gathering as well -- All the issues are you related to how it use use technologies as to of control and I don't get into because I think many folks here highlighted that as well -- We have also seen a lot of social media is intimidation one thing that I can hear you today. Is -- The LGBTQ community and their partners and social media to their families when they have not done you know that's a very brutal way to take. Something from you -- Also -- We must reveal legal procedures for survivors to get electronic properties on a track in a timely manner. Up for example I am myself a survivor off domestic violence when I first immigrated to do not stays in. Two thousand four I ended up having to go to a better shelter in the last name only with the clothing on my back. And in order for me to go back and get my electronics I had to go up life for a restraining order wait thirty days in order to have a judge. To then have a shared go you'll get at least all your properties. And by the time the perpetrator had already had access to the computer on my password to reach out to a family had. Gotten to my email accounts so I think you know the legislative like I I really appreciate this opportunity because will be good to look into a way. That survivors can get access to their properties one uses the one that state of the house or that user has control over their properties -- Yeah so I'm just honored that the California party she to an the mystic violence asked me to be here. And I hope to continue to contribute to efforts to help discuss wrote to the roots off. Domestic violence in our communities and creating my protections just survivors. Thank. I also have the story. Pop up when you are talking -- And you know with everything that's going on with the federal system and all of the immigration -- Controversies -- There was a case where -- Eighty documented -- Husband had an undocumented -- Beat her and said if you know if you do anything I'm going to go to the party. And eventually started -- Abusing the children as well and saying. What do you get a deal and so -- It is very difficult especially with the situation that's going on on federally by. It's hard to point -- To some of these services because I think a lot of our our immigrant communities are free of point of coming forward because of the different things that are going on and so. I know that now more than ever we need your support and services to to be I'd. Aye immigrant communities and no believe it or not -- Even if they are documented the perpetrators -- Somehow brain washed the victim into thinking that they have power over their immigration status so even if they're documented I've heard them say well you only documented because I allowed it so I did a moment I can call and take it away. And if you're not educated and have no idea. And being very basically a slave to the perpetrator because you're just trying to maintain your your life and maintain your family so thank you for being here with us today -- And I want to think assembly member child -- For participating this morning I know we're all running around by -- Thank you again and if there's no -- Questions will have an opportunity to have other questions when we finished by thank you for your testimony. The okay so next we have empowering youth in using technology and the mystic violence -- I'd like to welcome our fourth and final panel no the five crisply bean -- Prevention and policy division director at peace over violence -- We also have the posh I'd done on prevention educator how a roof. And Devin mallet prevention specialist at one eight Glendale Okay so to the assembly members Rubio and talent to this joint hearing and to the partnership for having us here today -- POV peace over violence is a community based organization that serves the greater Los Angeles and Westinghouse area. To help people build healthy relations unity is free from sexual domestic and interpersonal violence -- I oversee our prevention department at peace over violence which includes a lot of activities for youth education and youth leadership development. We provide violence prevention education in the classrooms for students -- We do leadership programs like our students together organizing peace program in schools our summer youth over violence institute an internship program and we help provide spaces for intergenerational conversations. Between young people and adults to talk about building healthy relationships so I want to say thank you again not just for having the space to talk about this really important conversation. But really ensuring that youth and prevention are part of these conversations. On unfortunately teen dating violence is something that happens and it's not often talked about as part of these broader conversation about domestic violence -- And it's often not taken seriously in a lot of times just kind of label teenage drama -- But we know that according to the National Council on crime and delinquency actually one in three young people deal with some kind of of violence from their dating partners whether that be sexual emotional verbal physical. Or digital -- And women and girls between the ages of sixteen and twenty four actually experience the highest rates of intimate partner violence which is three times above the national average. On and you know that I can have lifelong effects on young people are not only when it comes to their mental health but then sometimes becoming adult. Victims of domestic violence after. Social media can two teen dating violence occurring -- There's a correlation that when -- Some sort of cyber or digital abuse is happening within a relationship that there is also physical and sexual violence company so that could be an indicator to kind of look. And see and dig deeper as to what's occurring in the relationship -- We know that things like Instagram and Snapchat and other forms of social media can be used to create an environment that's threatening or intimidating in order to control that person's partner -- And that social media can feel relentless it can be anonymous you can feel inescapable and like someone mentioned earlier we've seen unfortunately people and people across the country die by suicide because of the pressures put on by social media -- And it kind of makes sense the appeal of social media can actually really -- Correlate to what's happening during that period of adolescent development and what's happening in the brain so we think about what young people are dealing with and they're experiencing you know there's this need. To have peer influence to feel like they're fitting and they want to appear more mature they're figuring out who they are they're really looking at sensation seeking activities. And they get a lot out of this instant gratification all things that social media are really really good at providing on and what we also see is that success can come from technology and social media. I don't know if any of you ever watch the MTV movie awards or anything like that in the past but like I was watching it this year I didn't know like half of those stars. Because their YouTube celebrities they're celebrities from Instagram they're seeing that they can become successful and get some satisfaction from being popular and famous using social media -- But I don't want to just the Mason -- So there's a place. For community organizing on social media if we look at things like the parkland survivors baking using social media as a platform to legislate or ask for legislation when it comes to gun control. On and as was mentioned earlier actually. A lot of mass violence can be connected to domestic violence over 50% of the mass shootings that have happened have had a connection to domestic violence and I think that in some of these cases. Including park when there's a case to be made but teen dating violence was a contributing factor to what happened we also see the need to movement which was started by Toronto Burke fifty years ago. But has really exploded once it came on to social media and became that hash tag I'm so we know we can look at things like the why I stayed hash tag right so. Social media and technology can be a place to get people to have these conversations to bring. Of stories to let to give survivors of boys to advocate on behalf of themselves. So peace over violence we've done this in different ways argues created a campaign called make a choice -- Where they're utilizing social media and technology to spread this message of make a choice to build healthy relationships and to be an up Stander and say something and do something when you see? On healthy things happening -- Are you posted online Twitter tax where they create their own memes and hash tags to create a dialogue to be able to ask questions and answer questions for other people about issues of teen dating violence. And we got we can also see how inter [inaudible] Lake Road respect dot org -- That's not cool dot com where teams can go if they have questions and resources because unfortunately one thing we also know is that young people don't often go to adults in their lives to ask for help or to get resources and so these are safe places. And some of these places even offer instead of hot lines like many of us run chaplain. Where young people can interact with somebody and you get immediate help like? I'm so I think it's important that we look at ways to utilize social media and not just look at it as something that you are going to use social media whether or not we tell them they're allowed to use it or not. We as adults use social media every day and are not going to just throw it away because someone tells us that it's bad. So we need to teach you how to use social media safely. And how to communicate effectively and responsibly on any to help. Them identify strategies for using social media to create social change like we've seen happening on any to help build upon legislation like the California healthy youth act. And help mandate prevention education in the classrooms and schools and expanded to looking at best practices for interventions and response policies so that it. Teen dating violence or sexual violence is happening and is affecting students we know and teachers know and administrators know exactly how they can respond to those to keep students safe -- And we can use this because schools are where students learn and so this needs to be the place where they're learning about how to have healthy relationships. How to healthy how to have healthy communication with folks include parents in the conversation so that they know how to talk to their children about these issues? On and just really create an environment that. So thank you so. Talk about young six of this conversation [inaudible] Thank you. The bill comes aye Chau Eggman with many of you I was former teacher I taught for sixteen years and you know it. At the conversation is great by reality it's difficult as first of all of the parents are to be able to address these issues with with students if you don't know -- Or you don't have access -- To what the the kids are doing and so the education and of that the from -- The detective with the education of not officers but in this case education of teachers and and school personnel -- By. Even the education of parents by my not question but more of a general comment is if the parents are those. Are victims of domestic violence the kids are seen as it doesn't feel practical -- To go to you know to the school sometimes again if there is no education by difficult like I said I was a teacher. Kids are not -- Very [inaudible] Trusting -- Because there's a B.. Real possibility that the social media will be taken away. And so they're having to balance the do I come forward. Right which obviously unless there's like one you know get some help. But they are so I don't see a ticket their ticket we're all addicted social media and so a lot of times they're they're faced with. If I say something then the social media is going to the ones that are supposed to stop doing what we're doing in order to prevent the violence. And so. I would like to work with you a little bit more I'm trying to figure out -- A balance between. The case chaired by trying to remove the stigma or trying to remove the possibility of the social media being taken away so I look for to to working with all with. All of you on again future legislation by if anything -- Conversations I do have brown tables with my superintendents levels -- Where it doesn't cost anything to at least have a conversation with the superintendent and maybe come up with -- Some kind of a policy because the team and we've all been here the whole morning the theme as we need more resources on fortunately. You know that's not always possible or I can't addresses legislators say okay yeah here you go I've we had a big battle over an additional just twenty million dollars -- To help -- You know in cases like this and it was a huge battle we ask for fifty and we ended up with twenty but it took. Literally the whole entire year of battling here you. But there are reality is that it's not going to be -- As easy and so if what my ask would be is help me come up with alternatives -- In lieu of the funding because funding is always the battle by. Again I have brown tables with my superintendent how can we bring some of these programs are in the conversations to the school through. You know for example me or those of you that live in other assembly district to bring them to the assembly members and I would love to be a conduit. Between my colleagues in Sacramento because everything cost money and we don't have the money and so I would like to also be a resource. To you and give me information as to what I can tell my colleagues up and down the state. The thing if I could just just about your comment about the state of mind used to be. Will coming for any one of the is a set up. Conversation but it just makes me think about issues of sexual violence that where alcohol is involved right and there's this fear that if I come forward because I've been drinking. You know especially if I'm under age what might happen and so I think it's kind of a parallel conversation that we can look at some strategies in those cases and apply it perhaps to social media. Thank you thank you very much ilex Natasha. Hello my name is Natasha Downham may prevention educator at the house approved. On a like a thank you all for giving me this opportunity to speak on behalf. Of my agency for youth that we serve in our community the house approved offers understood over briefly as our twenty four hour hotline -- Shelter services for emergency and transitional -- Case management legal services but the services I really like to highlight today are the services that truly benefit are you which is our prevention team -- As well as our team tech top line that we have recently launched -- So just to give a brief understanding of the prevention team so we do as we go into the classroom -- As the same -- Providing with so much education -- Amatil to the we break the cycle of domestic violence that they may want to send their own households. Providing the different option. From some other work though utilized especially with the technology side is to be able be advocates -- Through their around which is social media which they all typically are involved with. I'm someone who's been able to utilize social media within our own agency is highlighted things such as him being by was awareness month -- Highland domestic violence awareness month and how they can be advocates on their own campuses. And we had to start their own club single additional service that we have utilized -- Social media which is advertising or annual a witness to our poster contest that we hope -- What that our caucus we allow you to express their themselves their experiences that they've gone through -- Whether it be through actual art canvas art painting and singing songs lyrical dance we given that problem given the opportunity to really utilize their voice. And to five again teenage violence that exists within their own my I think communities -- We have are you the by three committee which is a very active -- Member on our board we have you coming from over maybe ten school to fifty schools where we are. Advertising at the come together the committee and they learn about the ins and outs of the nineteen eighty one is the Civic -- They learn how to be leaders as well we host a leads training and to learn advocates do -- In their communities and be advocates on their own campuses where it really has sparked into -- Creative club that I just spoke about on their own campuses and how they can create policies within their own schools -- We also have had teams utilize -- You too bye creating PSA -- We provide them with the tools that we just ask them how can we help you really want to put the power in their hands of what story that in the current -- Like the wanted to be able to share that experience through that as well. And then we also utilize the technology platform with our team tax help line that we just recently started -- Why we began this help one was the car because he saw there was a definite need -- For something else I need -- Not being met for resource wise but are you -- There is a lot of ways we definitely heard of verbally in the classroom just discussion back and forth but I thought kind of the more. Physical evidence within our pre surveys that we provide to our youth at the beginning of our course. I'm with those free surveys are typically done some kind of meet them where they're at and there's a question I asked you know the resources that are available to you in your community. And over 80% of them stated now. So -- We definitely thought it is kind of a general need their so with that data. Only were able to kind of explore on ways we can help them I'm eliminate that kind of bare year. And as we all know the ins and as well the does the marketing they're very connected to their phone so to me it's more of a space for them -- So with that we are able to sign in and increasing data for them by providing a better service to them -- With that tailored service specific -- The a service that might. I'm just a little history of that he had his own experience to work with domestic violence so he understood the confidentiality in the safety risk behind it -- So with that program was able to create of a and with his engineering background is able to create a program that really -- Eliminated Sir bear that would. Eliminate the state the race that we could possibly take place -- So with that we have Frank advocates that our own making our hotline -- Hours of their bill would be Monday to Friday right now between eleven AM and five PM -- They've gone through a forty hour domestic violence training so they can know the proper response for individual that is reaching out for help -- This new innovative strategy and we need to our youth who are exposed to are victims of dating violence bullying or violence in their own homes. And it reaches them at the point of needed their primary source of communication which is their cell phones and it also fills a gap of a service -- Because we understand that is a scary thing three times the I need help. So there may be a lot of fear or anxiety that may exist in which prevent them from reaching out for help especially calling someone a string on the line -- It's more of a comfort for them to be able to text someone are and it's all done through a desktop system -- Their numbers coming as anonymous numbers at random to sign. I'm at the Armenian reporter so there are certain situations where that happens to be broken -- But they have an understanding and then the phone message. With our help line -- We have of the city a little bit about it -- We are seeing on average approximately -- Forty five taxes for a week and we slaughter program the second week of July -- With the understanding that this is going to be a slow rising -- Program -- Reaching out to our youth and really encouraging them to utilize the program into this thing that we spoke about earlier. On receiving help especially with that so -- It's really been and they excited we speak about in the classroom -- Especially with more where's we bring them on the teen dating violence so they can recognize themselves the areas that you do need assistance -- We definitely foresee this program be right that service -- If it's not domestic violence specific we absolutely have -- Strong list of referrals that we do -- Send them to the fact that they're not close -- To our office to work abroad with our chat services a counseling or things of that sort we definitely refer out in -- Are trying to get more connections throughout our community -- We service the is the reason of Los Angeles all the way through the west in the San Benito county. But we definitely have resources outside of that just to meet those you that they do come in our hotline [inaudible] Thank you. Thank you very much. Next and last but not least -- We have our own Devon -- Panelists I just want to thank everyone for being here today and thank you for having that -- Thank you for the the panelists for sharing your story painting really complex complex picture. Of how domestic violence and technology intersect. I'm so my name if dozen mailing I am YWCA Glendale's prevention specialist. In our ninety year history we have been doing prevention work for only two years -- Our first focuses mostly on intervention so what what we DO -- You know what when violence occurs but we really wanted to focus on what it wasn't happening at all. We take a public health approach so it's this idea that -- Think about flu season it's simply that -- What are the little things we could do every day to stay well like with the fleet right we wash our hands we stay away from people we are sick? Little things to do to stay well are a lot easier than the when our lives are uprooted when we fall. This is the approach that we take to violence prevention -- What can we do to stay well as an individual and as a community -- And that's for young people and their use of technology plays a very vital role. These everyday acts of wellness that we promote and are prevention recognizing warning signs the violence learning to manage conflict in a healthy way. Helping a friend he's experiencing violent. Learning boundaries consent. These are all acts that can only be learned by teens but these messages these behaviors these skills. Can be spread and promoted by them. You have bill extremely vast and dense social networks all over the world. The team I work with tell me about their best friends in Texas El Salvador Thailand's thing. They tell me how their tweets have been retweeted by hundreds of other teens. How a celebrity might have re tweeted them -- Team have a powerful voice. They have a great deal of influence among their peers in in their community. So part of our prevention where. It's not only exploring issues of teen dating violence but how do we harness that leadership how do we help you find their voice. And use it in a way that promotes healthy communities. So for our YWCA Glendale our work started with conversations and a lot of them -- We went into classrooms we hosted training for class credit -- We spoke to club immobilized wallets this on issues that affect them in their school sexual harassment dating violence sexual assault and racism. Discuss how to interrupt these acts of violence. We talked about how social media can be a very powerful tool and spreading his ideas we were talking about. And to call out violence when you see it. After we had this conversation. What we notice is students wanted to talk more students wanted to get more involved -- I had a group of students walk from school one day to my office. To talk about a friend who is experiencing domestic violence and what they could do -- I had student to state our long after presentation was over to talk about issues of sent that they were too embarrassed to talk. To talk about an for their classmates. I've had students request -- Other conditions with peers I had students request presentations for their parents. Until it students it's not teachers it's on adult it's you. Who want to have this conversation is you to want to do something -- Young people are often tool that they can not enact real social with little change -- They're told that they're too young too inexperienced to naive or two idealistic. But if you have shown us time and time again we heard several examples. The young people hold Y. ten jewel in the realm of activism and social justice work. And they can realize that potential through the use of technology. I'll give a call. And that is the question. She asked me to speak at a walk out she organized after school. Protesting the school administrations response to complaints of sexual harassment made against another student. She had made a YouTube video. YouTube video went viral. Spread around -- Schools in New York Texas in Massachusetts all organized walk out in solidarity with her -- I had the opportunity to talk to students that they about consent ways and we brainstorm ways that they continue the conversation. Just Monday I got a call from a from a teacher at that school. Who wanted to know how to talk about consent with their students -- The reach that hurt it had it would not have been possible without technology -- To an adolescent development the power the peers extremely important. Teams are seeking connection teams are seeking acceptance. And approval. And so for me is a great way to meet those needs. Social media communication helps you develop better social skills Feel isolated. Learn about new ideas new culture. Bond with their friends. Express themselves. And get support. So why not encourage you to use that to create healthy communities. We know what we see in a classroom with told to us. But as assembly member Rubio mention like we're not that next to it. Right we're not in group chat we're not in hot boys were not in their social media. You are connected to their communities you are connected to other you. In a way that we cannot be. So when young people are then given the skills and tools through prevention education to follow her own voice to create their own messages. Dobson we can change communities. The young people have the power to make our community well. To prevent harm from ever happening. Domestic violence service providers and advocates. Policy advocates policy makers. Continue to focus on the power of youth in prevention education we can see things occur Thank you. Will you very much -- At this time I would like to open it up to a public comment on if you want to step up to the podium if you have any comments. Or if you have questions will be around and we have the information of all of our pan. Mason but if there's anybody interested in -- Making a comment. You can come up. Thank you very much. I just wanted. To make a profit and I just wanted to quickly. Address just a few things -- Thank you. I don't think it's about adding additional resources in fact when we went through an economic downturn. I was invigorated on how we could change the way we do business right I think that's the most important thing -- We have the California office of emergency services law enforcement specialized units grant we have several domestic brown's grants that are out there. It really is about changing how we use our resources and if we had priority areas within their in terms of technology abuse and there are some in there already. But we strengthen the language I think that we can become more effective across the state in terms of how we use those monies -- And more with thought and I love law enforcement specials units grant specifically because of Fong course me. And advocacy they're required to work together advocate is required to come into the police department which I think is. Phenomenal is been great for us -- We were able to use the California office of research grants. To teach our investigators to do things differently so no matter if we lost the money or not. They were just taught a different skill sets we developed an internal program so it didn't matter if anybody gave us me because we can do it ourselves. So I think that's an opportunity that also I would just like to address -- Some of it the stuff that came up earlier. Absolutely evicting should not have to wait thirty days to going to their house if you have an emergency protective order you can go into your house. And you can obtain some of the items that you need they're not going to divide up all of your property but you can't get yourself as you can get certain items etcetera. The judge can actually lists certain items of property on emergency protective order -- On your temporary would not if you'll excuse me minor temporary restraining order that's great. So I do want to let you guys know that that is out there and available. Absolutely if you can't on this comes out of his agencies in here but if you can't find a local advocacy agency please go to your local family just. Twenty one the right direction -- And then also I think before immigration immigration can. We have got to get better at training on UV says. If we can train I mean I heard people try to use you leases to absolutely don't need to be used in the fifties okay. Under two guys to show up a gun fight one guy lost okay but we need for domestic violence victims we apps or sexual abuse victims are spousal in a partner victims understand what that is -- And we're there to help. Yeah but we really are and we just need to depart or a little bit more -- By all means if you got any issues. Or need help on how do I talk to law enforcement. You know how do I speak the language. Please by all means reach out to me I'll be happy to help you point in the right direction. Thank you. Thank you very much and and you are correct and I think that's why are these that hearings have been so productive in my opinion because I myself didn't know. A lot of the resources that were available and if I you know consider myself -- Advocate for so many different things and I have no idea about these resources I think that's why it's so important for all of you to be here today. So that we can start spreading the information and I we've committed to putting all the resources on our website. And maybe some of our our partners and some of my do the same for will try to get together with the partnership to see what what the best way would be and then our belief. Might my colleagues to make sure that all of that information is on on their cell thank you very much. One of the S. good morning of my name's mark that someone on the field fund road academy on the theme of the disconnection. And I'm very happy. For your vacation assembly woman like a total for being here and hearing all the speakers -- I am soul on excited about all the information you and agencies that are available out there in the community that. The percentage provided to us today -- I do wanna effect -- I ready made a partnership with -- The officer next to the entrance of Chiu providing training in Spanish the Spanish community I work -- My target that our audiences that my great community and as many of you know -- The migrant community as some of you mentioned of provides allow. All the violations to happen in the and it. Are part of this but there you use also involved. So -- My proposal offer this out to continue is to not only to partner ourselves on providing the this kind of education but looking for grant. You know our academy of pretty much provide the training from our own personal pocket. That's how bad a Latino community agencies out there providing this kind of a important information. They just X. another item in my academy to continue educating the community and that worries me because there's so much information that you guys have. The we need to start tried. A lot of the information we need to start pencilling a lot of the speakers in every in every area. So -- My proposal to you assembly woman is maybe to add some kind of a set advocate. To the migrant community to continue adding or looking for those grants or helping us you know look for those grants to be sure that. This will take place and I think everybody here you guys are wonderful in my Santa Cruz I'm a graduate of Santa Cruz we are definitely going to work together glasses [inaudible] Thank you. Thank you it's an honor to be here amount until young older several of us here are CEO devil if Cristina Locle and myself and we we are honored because I think it's quite often minimized. And it's such an important topic and and did all you know you. Have to know what we were gonna say training is crucial. We I think most of us as service providers in the DVD feel we partner with law enforcement but we need to really strengthen our relationship so we listening. To the conversation for the past two and a half hours I even a life sometimes we minimize back because you know. Technology up or is a form of should be protection and not a product and all. And that's something that is very prevalent in the DVD feel. So I think with training and way the just -- Reaching out to each other and also. Looking out what other service providers are doing is also that a trained in the field in terms of how to reach the the the teens because for me that was such a popular thing to know that yes it is a form of protect. Of of control but it's also a way to empower and become a survivor a TT that may be experiencing that. Doesn't have to be harmful it could be on the country could be something that could help. So it is I look forward to these conversations but to see what the legislation will also. Inform [inaudible] Thank you. Hello I think these. Conversations are very important but I work in a domestic violence shelter and we just recently implemented a policy on helping to get them to maintain their cell phones and filter -- Many shelters do not allow that. But it is easy. To service to our clients to take their phone so it was a lengthy conversation and many of our staff are not trained in technology. So it is something that we do. To help us and give us. Advice and suggestions on how. To inform them of safe ways to keep their phones and use them safely and we did that as a staff but we would. Eight more involvement from the technology companies because taking the phones from the done does not help them it hurts found. And we need to help them to have all the resources and maintain their contacts with people who are supported to them. And their allies support system. Thank you thank you and and onto the comic I I agree I think -- But the lives of the victims are already up and about the days and then to take something so are we live with our phones I mean it's not a secret anymore. And to to lose something else -- I think is is a of what's happening when you take away that the technology that we depend on every day and so that's just another loss of and basically. Odd looking at them as a second class citizens because now they don't have access to electronic -- So thank you for doing that and you know I think -- We have much to talk about and hopefully we can all and try to figure out -- What we do now after the conversations and I've said it many times in our our previous -- Hearing that I love the conversations by. We're just having a conversation and basically wasting our day and of my commitment and the commitment from. From -- Our partners is that it won't be a waste of time this is actually a conversation to begin action something. Hello my name is Amanda at the hidden from. I guess I had a few questions -- We are looking for immediate action and thank you all for everybody information on I wanted to know at the family courts like Stanley Mosk armed the talking parents that's the I ordered. Between the parent and the father and the mother the children while the border these battles. Is there any kind of catch net to catch domestic violence at that level because that's happening now and not as with current. And I found somebody who got the night. Domestic violence protection records. And I represent myself poker into a woman. Might have been wasted fifteen thousand dollars in a group home. But then. I'm going to another situation idea to go here but I need help because I was. A child office in god back in twenty fifteen help me with the same abuse but never got resolved.

And I work at four different law firms there is something seriously going wrong. And we need to address it like immediately. There should be some kind of caps that at all of these. Spots where kids could be harmed and it's just not their the advocates lawyers. American Bar such I used to respect the law. Now I am just quite surprised that is not in the chicken pox -- I would like on to talk to many people I will try to address by email on my specifically but a child's office help recruit like within three days -- I belong to the house of group -- I won at the state level level and appeals against the county of for we believe the nine rights at house of room where I was that -- Still might be easier was able to do.

Right just wanted knowledge your story and thank you for sharing it with all of us in the room that -- Credible important for the voices of ours we heard the thank you. For yeah -- Do you for listening. I wanted to address a couple of previous comments that came up the previous commenter talk about cell phones being taken away we partner with them it thinking that project as well so I wanted to put in a plug -- For those trainings -- We see similar things happening across the country and unfortunately it's the same pattern that. You know of users use is taking away devices and controlling so so wanting to really get into organizations and assist with that and I just wanna put it applied -- For some resources we have it takes a few dot org -- There's a legal systems tool kit that's available for law enforcement and court personnel -- And also an agency you still care for local programs and then -- Survivor tool kit -- For victims. Who are looking for a split around technology safety Thank you. Hi how are you thank you so much of an honor to be here money said yes now if I'm with with the ball park police department and I'm actually that the method by the topic at that. I've been with them for ten years. So I know how important this is for everyone. For as for me I actually was a victim of domestic violence from the age of fourteen always reach like. Twenty four so I know how important it is by no one reasons why you say there are no other reason. That -- Sometimes it's hard to actually communicate that out on I think it's really important but I think that I was telling on the council. I think that if we could start something there with the schools it would be amazing because the ages that we see that happening it started hurting I felt. Really able to a really young age but it is happening there another part that I do want to say is that the long park police department has done an amazing job. To keep me that because when they can't to the victims the one that talks to them with myself. So often apple my with their you recess on my part to the offices of Adam at first they were not sure what it was. I did a little bit of research -- Was able to do that the last two thousand and also I think it's really important every year -- I do want to get some of your information so I could take back to one point -- To take somebody's officers of the park. Don't really understand so I can think you and it's an honor to be. Thank you for and I want to welcome -- Councilmember cruise back up from the city bottom park I missed you earlier something can. The room is an armor public safety commissioner here in the city of the wording [inaudible] And I'm seventy years old and I just now. Learned about domestic violence and I don't mean today. But about three weeks ago I was on a trial [inaudible] Which but selecting was. I guess for the very difficult but we had a lot of women that actually got up and spoke. And that were dismissed. And it was a key because each of them had been victims of of a domestic violence and down. The first question the judge asked Japan was. Did you call the police is a report on and there were. The vast majority this it bill. And they said because they wouldn't do anything. And one actually in the in the more people to get it in a funny way than the way it was meant that she had actually said that -- She didn't call and but the neighbor did because it was a fight next door and they were complaining about the noise. An officer showed up. And her husband had to be here and the officers saw her all bloodied been basically is said this is a domestic matter and we really don't handle these things. So he left and she said she went to the bathroom clean up and sure enough when. When -- She was nice and clean and the cop was nice and gone he beat her again [inaudible] And it. Really chair perspective during the campaña hearings because when I heard that women speaking. The victim in particular case you're handling. Responded almost directly the same way. There was not a lot a consistent see in the way she responded there was a lot of confusion. And pain -- Have a heavy Spanish accent I request that the interpreter. Be brought in in. They decided to ask her about that at first she said no and then she said yes and then finally she said she'd be more comfortable with the translator. And the purpose for my asking that was at the way she was industry and I kind of was very convinced that that her attitude was more from me language Berrier then from male A dramatic. And it as it turned out her answers didn't changes she was cold in Spanish -- Essay questions [inaudible] And what was difficult for us is that -- We were told in the instructions. That. There had to be. Reasonable doubt it if it was her word against his word. We have to take his word unless there was something there profoundly made that And in. Two of the three charges we were able to find something different and we're able to find him guilty. But in the third which I thought was probably the most heinous of the three that was just the two of them his word against hers so we had to find him not guilty. This. Is route three I think were the just Justin -- Discourages people from going in. And the way his attorney can't describe her. Was not what we are you know she basically was in Pierce was basically. Still traumatized and she was basically trying. To answer questions but she was scared. But we could use that instant what we had to use against them was. Evidence to support it in one of the our of come. He had actually admitted it to an officer after he refuses Miranda rights and told the officer that he in the first. One it was his attorney speaking for him that basically convicted him because she made in exchange for the first charge but in the opening and closing statements she changed her story local. But the consistency was. That he had done. What he was accused of So. I think this is were. We need to you know as a as a society -- Find a way of working with these people. Getting them you know beyond their their trauma it don't mean. Get him out of it and forget it I mean. Help them to get to the point to where they can communicate. What's going on because this is for the courts. Let them down. And you know and to tell you that my wife and I we've been together. About forty four years and I when we saw the the hearings she actually defended Cavanaugh because she thought this woman waited way too long. To bring this out and I had just. Found out you know first hand why they didn't bring it out. So. I think I got a really different perspective on the at least under to know why we were coming back explaining. Things if they had gone -- To through. And this is where we need. To basically bring along into line with what's happening. And I don't think that. That -- Judges shouldn't go through trapping also I think they really do need to because I think that you know like I said between my wife and I we have two different views known is because I've been on one of these files and she hasn't And it's just the way it basically perspective and it's what you see. Now. Prior to that. I was assigned. Rated based that's what I did for a living and is science you basically research everything you have an order the you put things in. And really I think is what prevented me from even seen another side of possibility. But I don't think that's just me I think that's people in in general and that's really what needs to be. Communicated is finding a way of of making the nearly Communities. Aware. Of what to look for what to see. And one the woman that was actually interviewing Cavanah. Accuser. That I found very valuable. And that is it. Somebody tell in a wider fairly consistent in. Somebody is telling the truth it actually varies a little. Each time because there's some emotion and some thought it to what's happening and that was what I saw exactly in the young lady that. Brought the charges [inaudible] But it's more than just a complicated issue is something that we really. Do need. To find new ways to address and new ways. To to work with. It is not a new problem it's a very old problems just a new way of using the and that's where. You like trying to come in. And fortunately you know I do have what they call it mark phone. But I'm done with a user. So. I get my kids will talk to you it takes me. So I had to get a phone that would let me. Get text program and when I did I don't use [inaudible] But what is the difference is what's happened in my generation is happening now is just a modern way of doing it. And their generation is gonna deal with that is a to get older they're going to find there's no ways of of communicating so this is going to be an ongoing thing but what. They all have in common is understanding. And knowing what to look. For thank you. Thank you. For the for the clothing because I think when we started the conversation we talk about how domestic violence doesn't see color. Doesn't see gender doesn't see -- Sexual orientation doesn't see socioeconomic status and the the response is that yes we can try and fix the courts by the state my behind. That being a victim of domestic violence until we can -- At least get big to to speak up we can fix the court system but if there's nobody going to the court systems -- Because they're not reporting their abuse that's where would that challenge life and I think we can do both and I want to thank all the panelists today all of them are members of the audience for being here. Again -- We would like this. And action bad like I said before I'm committed to because of my personal experience with my sister but because of the experiences of so many people that I've met in the last two years -- Count on me as a supporter but also. I learn something new every time we have a hearing and I need you those of you that are experts in these fields to let us know what you think fix would be. Whether the money or like -- The the detective stated not everything takes money so help me figure out policies that might be able to be implemented without that money so that there is know excuse -- From -- Not being able to help them out that binds thank them so I want to thank you today for participating -- We have our advocates here please exchange cards please exchange information and I look forward -- To being -- With you and our next hearing and so we'll go ahead and a German at this moment and again thank you for being here.
