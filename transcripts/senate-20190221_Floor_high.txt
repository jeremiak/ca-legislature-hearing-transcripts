you to the California State Senate thank you members without objection we're going to move to Senate third reading and focus on SB one twenty six file item number two senator Leyva center labor is prepared to take take this item up Mister secretary can you please read Senate bill one twenty six by senator Leyva and actually to charter schools center labor the floor is yours thank you Mister president good morning members SB one twenty six ensures that charter schools comply with the same transparency and accountability laws all of our other public schools currently follow as you know the governor recently called for swift action to resolve ongoing charter school transparency issues while charter schools are unique in many ways they are publicly funded and yet they lack the same transparency and accountability requirements the governor other publicly funded educational institutions under this bill charter school governing boards will be required to comply with the same open meeting conflict of interest and disclosure laws as traditional public school boards this bill will also ensure that members of charter school governing boards cannot use their positions for personal or political game for several years the legislature has attempted to bring clarity to this issue fortunately our Attorney General recently published an opinion clearly stating that yes these good government laws do apply to charter schools while the attorney general's opinion provides much needed clarity on whether or not these laws apply to charter school governing boards the pin is not legally binding absent the measure before you today which codifies the attorney general's opinion disputes will continue to happen across the state over how these laws actually applied to charter schools members SB one twenty six reflects our bicameral response to the governor's call for action this bill supported by teachers school board members labor and civil rights organizations the California charter schools association is neutral on this bill I respectfully request an aye vote thank you senator Leyva members we're gonna open it up for discussion or debate center Glazer good morning Sir thank you madam Mister president and -- members aye aye rise also in favor about this legislation I want to thank the senator from Chino -- her counterpart in the assembly the assembly member from Long Beach -- governor news some -- and stakeholders who worked hard on this issue over the last a few weeks at this is a -- an issue that center -- from Santa Monica and I worked on for a number of years -- it is true that -- charter schools receive public dollars and they should they should be under obligation to provide the same public disclosure open meeting requirements that are other schools that that are funded by the public -- are -- must undertake I would note a couple things about this legislation one is it does not provide an exception to the rule on nine conflict by allowing teachers to participate in charter school boards and I think that's a healthy addition to -- governance we've done something similar at our university system by allowing faculty members to serve on our governing boards there but secondly -- that legislation has a point of sensitivity in regard to the charter schools that are on tribal lands and I appreciate the author's work to ensure that we recognize the special status of a of a charter school I think there's just one on tribal lands here in this space members is been a lot of contentious at ness and controversy and -- I'm happy to see the parties come together -- and finding common ground on this legislation I know that there are other issues -- in this space that continue to be points of contention I appreciate governor nuisance requested the superintendent to form a task force to deal with some of the important issues regarding work will happen through the course of this year it's my hope that the work that we do today the passage of this legislation on the work that's going to go -- on going with the superintendent and the governor will allow for some level of peace to rein in our land on these issues over the course of the of this year -- and that this legislation is a good start it's found common ground it has a balance to it and I hope that that can set the right tone is the the author said it during the committee hearing set the right tone after the year and I thank her for her leadership on this thank you thank you very continue discussion or debate will go first to senator more lock and then to senator Allen center more like the floor is yours Sir good morning thank you Mister president I'd like to address SB one twenty six from three different perspectives at the first is I believe in no better and no worse if a public school district board must follow the requirements elaborated in the bill and charter schools should to to California has nine hundred and forty four school districts a third of them as of June thirty twenty seventeen have been manage prudently reflecting positive net unrestricted assets the others are at various stages of fiscal distress yes seen recently with LA unified school district teacher still feel underpaid and thus under appreciated and they would still like to have more nurses and counselors all good requests understood but where will the funding come from obviously prop ninety eight is not cutting it to the governor and the legislature reposition some of the twenty one billion dollars surplus we're talking about in our budget maybe we could provide some help for our schools on top of the significant cal stirs contribution that the governor's proposing the fed the fiscal strings are showing in this week Oakland unified school district is ready to go on strike so third we're complaining about a lot of things in in my part of the state listening to the news ever apparently that the fall guy seems to be charter schools everybody's pointing at that a special committee and I I I would I would I think you have to look past a lot of other culprits like pensions and in the case of LA unified school district retiree medical liabilities they just published their June thirty eight eighteen comprehensive annual financial report and had reflect fifteen billion dollars of unfunded retiree medical that's more than twenty four thousand dollars per student but more is a mess you would not see charter schools at school districts were providing great education for students appearance at every income stratum parents were telling us something is wrong and they're voting with their feet and they're waiting in long lines to get into a charter school so we are seeing a symptom a bigger bigger concerns Mister president consequently tightening the screws on charter schools may be a misdirected an unfair legislative solution the legislature needs to take a hard look at the facts and not come to the wrong conclusions governor brown even started to charter schools and supports them in Oakland the smart money in LA supports charter schools maybe it's time to reevaluate maybe this legislature should really evaluate what we're doing the prop ninety eight with pension benefits going forward with retiree medical benefit formulas and with school district funding allocations that should make establishing charter schools financially seamless and a notice to their budgets colleagues I want to support a bill that addresses the deep systematic currents that are hurting our school districts SB one twenty six is a bandaid when major surgery is needed thank you Mister president center were locked we're not gonna turn the Florida senator Allen then we'll go to senator Jackson center own members I want to commend the authors and I wanted to do the associate myself with the comments made by this center from around at your behind so many these bills is -- oftentimes incredible amount of staff work and I just want to take a moment having -- worked on this issue for quite some time to recognize the work of two very extraordinary staffers whose whose work underpinned several aspects of this bill one of them from my own personal staff Jennifer chase and then from the Education Committee staff -- in Johnson is still there and work with me very closely when I was the education chair -- to really extraordinary public servants are staff of names are not out of Klay recognized and so much of their work is is present in an in aspects of this bill -- there are to public servants and I wanna recognize them thank you Sir center Jackson sorcerers thank you a miss press in college I want to return us back to what this bill is not what it isn't -- and it's a very important bill and I appreciate and know that there's been a lot of hard work done in this the bill's appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a number of years and efforts have been made to really try to address what this bill is all about it is about transparency and accountability so charter schools receive enormous amount of taxpayer dollars and their charge with educating our children a a responsible task in in a reasonable one but there needs to be sunshine in all publicly funded schools and their governing bodies and that is what this bill calls for and I am pleased that the California Attorney General recently published an opinion that was consistent with the opinion of our legislative counsel that our state robots sunshine laws apply to all charter schools that's what this bill is about and it's critically important because the public is not only entitled but they deserve to know where our money is going and how it is being spent particularly in the pursuit of educating our children so I am pleased that this bill codifies once and for all that the public records act open meeting laws political Reform Act and government codes section ten ninety apply to charter schools that is this bill and with that I -- drive vote for under discussion or debate senator gorgeous Mr resume idea pose a question to the maker this agenda item center Leyva we use up the question from center board I would love a question or just please proceed thank you very much -- I wanted to -- -- extend my appreciation for bring this issue up for discussion as an educator I do fully appreciate -- the importance of the brown act when it comes to publicly funded institutions I think it's important that if -- if public institutions on the traditional sense are bound by the requirements of the brown act -- so too should charter schools in my opinion so I I think that is very clear in my opinion -- one of the points brought up by one of my colleagues is are we are we imposing additional requirements on charter schools by virtue of this teleconference requirement that don't that doesn't exist with the traditional public schools can you explain that further I I certainly can't as we as we talked earlier this morning when you asked me the same question I said the reason we're doing that is because with charter schools they may have locations up and down the state in in other areas within the school district the schools are with in that district so many school districts move the locations and the meetings around so that's accessible for everyone if I have a charter school it's here in Sacramento and I have another one that's in Chino another one that's in San Diego in order to make it accessible for everyone having the teleconference is a way to let everyone participate into in the interest of a cost estimate for the new teleconferencing requirements the two way teleconferencing for all of and I do not okay committees that this would normally be refer to that were not in this instance I have no idea why appear before the committees that rule said I need to appear before -- thank you very much thank you members under discussion or debate last call discussion or debate on the floor hearing you see nine center Leyva would you like to close please I would think you are Mister president members I think you those of you for our your support on this bill those who spoke in support I appreciate the questions and I did want to lay to rest some of the issues that the senator from Orange County brought up not fiscal at all it's only about

the Majority Leader Hertzberg is it what about what percentage center Hertzberg thank you very much sure Mister president I arise today with a heavy heart that to to commemorate the life of the legendary Dodger pitcher and long time resident of committees I represent don Newcombe -- I did know him but I suspect a lot of folks here on this floor knew of him or knew him two days ago on February nineteenth he passed away at the age of ninety two don Newcombe as many know was one of the greatest pitchers in Dodger history over his ten year career in the major leagues he recorded a hundred and forty nine wins one thousand one hundred and twenty nine strikeouts twenty four shutouts with in a total of two thousand one hundred and fifty four innings pitched a body any was an extraordinary trailblazer a Mister new come in nineteen forty nine he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers and became the third African American pitcher in the major leagues of that year he was among the first for African American players ever to be named and also to the all star team along with Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella and Larry Doby and fifty six at the pinnacle of his career he won both the sci one of the young award in the National League MVP award and held an impressive record of twenty seven wins seven losses after his retirement Mister Neukom remain deeply involved the Dodge organization as a director of community affairs an adviser to the teams teams German and remained an avid fan de rarely rarely did he missed a game that the Dodgers were beating the giants armed whatever they were but you could tell about much of a sports fan but I got a great people live in the community I represent but before he passed I just want to share one final thought he a don had a the conversation a with the LA with an LA times reporter and yet in that conversation he said I remember Jackie Jackie Robinson calling me and Roy together after we first signed with the Dodgers don said Jackie said that people are going to hate us in abuse us and by changing one letter in a word we can make a difference he paused for a moment and said bitter just change the are you T. Jackie said it we should fight to be better not bitter and sure enough that's what happened don Newcombe is survived by his wife Karen three children don junior Kelly and Bret two grand a children came in and Ryan members please join me in a joining in the memory of the baseball legend an American hero a don Newcombe thank you so much miss Majority Leader enter Bradford on this item Sir yes Mister president I join my colleague from the San Fernando Valley and journeyed in the memory of don Newcombe aye individual that I did now -- individual that a French it was developed not through

come in he'd always say call me don or the big new but I was always Mister new come to me but he shared more about life than anything else and here's individual who should be in the hall of fame if it's not for his substance abuse that he didn't run from going to the hall of fame a career as soon Hertzberg stated it was only ten years in the making are two of those were interrupted for military service and once returning back from military service he was quite upset at the fact that he still could not stay in the hotels wood is white colleagues and so he and Jackie Robinson and -- Roy Campanella decided one day we're going to get off the bus and we're going into this white hotel we're going to stay here the manager came down he says you can stay here log you don't swim in the pool but he was a trail blazer and civil rights in many ways Dr Martin Luther king had a conversation shortly before his assassination any thank don Newcombe usage you made my good odd journey and civil rights any quality that much easier by what you did in baseball baseball was opportunity to bring folks together and mark the to king appreciated his contributions there Mister Nichols spent the last fifty four years of his life helping other video at individuals whether they were in sports entertainment industry or just regular everyday folks deal with substance abuse add dot was his passion
