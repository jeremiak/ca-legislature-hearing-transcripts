THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MOTIONS SECOND I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF POINTS I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ARE IMPORTANT- TO ADDRESS WHY THIS BILL BEFORE YOU AB SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE IS A BIPARTISAN. BILL THAT DEALS WITH THIS STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THE PROCUREMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CURRENT LAW DIRECTS OUR INSTITUTIONS TO GIVE PREFERENCE FOR FOOD GROWN STATE WHEN THE PRICE OF CALIFORNIA PURPOSE DOES NOT EXCEED THE ESTATE PRODUCE BY MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT. HOWEVER THE LAW EXEMPTS OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE AMONG THE LARGEST INSTITUTIONAL PURCHASERS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WILL THE FEDERAL LONG TO THE BUY AMERICA PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PURCHASE DOMESTIC COMMODITIES AND PRODUCTS FOR SCHOOL MEALS LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW ALLOW SCHOOLS TO PURCHASE CHEAPER FOREIGN PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA GROWN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE. SACRAMENTO BEE STARRING TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOUNDED SACRAMENTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PURCHASE CANNED PEACHES AND MIXED FRUIT FROM CHINA AND VIOLATION OF BUY AMERICA POLICIES EVEN THOUGH NEARLY ALL US CANNED PEACHES AND PLASTIC PACKAGES OF PEACHES ARE HERE GROWN IN CALIFORNIA- FURTHER MORE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE LOTTERY SHOULD REPORT THAT FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS REVIEWED. HAD ADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT BUY AMERICAN LAWS AND THEY HAD PURCHASE FOREIGN SOURCED ITEMS BUT DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION TO JUSTIFY THOSE PURCHASES DESPITE OUR STATE AGRICULTURAL BOUNTY PRODUCERS FOR FACE COMPETITION FROM NON DOMESTIC PRODUCERS IN CHINA AND MEXICO AND OTHER NATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LABOR AND ENVIRONMENT PROTECTIONS OR QUALITY CONTROL AS WE DO. CALIFORNIA SITUATION SPEND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY ON FOOD PURCHASING IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE ESTIMATED TO SPEND BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED ANNUALLY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY- TO ON DIRECT FOOD PURCHASES THAT IS NEARLY ONE BILLION THAT THE STATE COULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND FARMWORKERS BY PURCHASING CALIFORNIA GROWN FOOD. A. B. SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT WOOD DIRECTOR STATE INSTITUTIONS AND SCHOOLS TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN FOOD WHEN AVAILABLE. AND WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY WOULD BE WIRED TO GET. TO US GROW FOOD OVER FOREIGN FOOD. CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BENEFITS WHEN THE STATE INSTITUTIONS DIRECT PURCHASING POWER TOWARD CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS AND FARMERS REINVESTMENT. BACK INTO THEIR CENTER WORKFORCE THE ECONOMY AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE SHOULD BE GIVING OUR FARMERS THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT THAT OUR STATE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS ARE THE BEST IN THE NATION.

DESPITE CLAIMS BY GEORGIA CALIFORNIA IS THE REAL PEACH STATE PRODUCING NEARLY 1100% OF THE NATION'S DOMESTIC CAN'T PEACH AND PLASTIC PACKAGED PEACH SUPPLY. OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF DECLINE- FOR DECADES NOW PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SUBSIDIZED FOREIGN IMPORTS PRIMARILY FROM CHINA DISPLACING. U. S. GROWERS WE'VE SEEN A 50% DECREASE IN ACREAGE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS- THE LATEST PROCESSOR CASUALTY IN OUR INDUSTRY OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN SENECA FOODS CLOSE THEIR MODESTO CANNERY- AND AS A RESULT OF THAT PLANT CLOSURE. NEARLY THREE HUNDRED LONG TIME EMPLOYEES WITH AN AVERAGE TENURE OF OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT LOST THEIR JOBS- IN ADDITION TO MANY OTHER SEASONAL PROCESSING JOBS IN THE FACILITY. WE'RE EXPRESSING OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION ENSURING THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE SPENT FOR FOOD PURCHASES WHICH BENEFIT CALIFORNIA GROWERS AND PROTECT UNION JOBS. IN PROCESSING PLANTS IN PACKING HOUSES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT THE COACHELLA VALLEY. EVEN FOLLOWING THE SENECA PLANT CLOSURES TODAY FOR CANNING ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND UNION JOBS. THIS ACTION WOULD BETTER ALIGN CALIFORNIA'S FOOD PROCUREMENT POLICY WITH BY AMERICAN DIRECT IS OUTLINED IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH EXECUTIVE ORDER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AT THIS POINT LET ME DEPART BRIEFLY FROM MY PREPARED REMARKS AND JUST NOTE THAT DURING HIS JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS LAST NIGHT. PRESIDENT BIDEN IN DESCRIBING HIS AMERICAN JOBS PLAN NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE GUIDED BY ONE PRINCIPLE BY AMERICAN. HE CONTINUED NOTING. AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE USED TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS MADE IN AMERICA TO CREATE AMERICAN JOBS. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND IT WILL BE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. HE CONTINUED SAYING HI I MADE IT CLEAR TO MY CABINET THIRD PLEASE GIVE EXEMPTIONS HAS BEEN STRENUOUSLY LIMITED IT WILL BE AMERICAN PRODUCTS. WE APPLAUD THIS STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT IN OUR VIEW THIS IS THE TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA TO CRAFT WORKABLE LEGISLATION ENSURING THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON AMERICAN GROWN FOOD PRODUCTS. WHICH SUPPORTS OUR FARMERS. VERTEX UNION JOBS IN PROCESSING FACILITIES BY THE WAY MANY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHILE PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH THE SAFEST FOOD AVAILABLE.

FOR PURPOSES OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS IT RELATES TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WITHOUT A DOUBT WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE MOST COMMITTED WORK FORCE IN THE AREA OF AGRICULTURE THAN ANY OTHER STATE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS ENSURE THAT- WE KEEP EIGHT ROBUST AND GROWING AGRICULTURAL.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I. WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY TAKING A MOMENT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS WORKING WITH US ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TO THE CALIFORNIA PATH BLOOD MATT BANK PET BLOOD BANK MODERNIZATION ACT. SEEKS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD FOR VETERINARY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND PHASE OUT THE OBSOLETE INHUMANE PRACTICE OF CAPTIVE CLOSED COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN OUR STATE. IT DOES THIS BY AUTHORIZING CALIFORNIA LICENSED VETERINARIANS TO OPERATE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS. TO PRODUCE AND SELL OR TRANSFER ANIMAL BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. VETERINARY TECHNICIANS AND VETERINARY ASSISTANCE MAY ALSO COLLECT THE BLOOD FROM AN ANIMAL UNDER DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED VETERINARIAN. THE BILL WOULD PLACE THE PRACTICE OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING UNDER THE JURISDICTION OVERSIGHT OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. AND MODERNIZES CALIFORNIA LAW BY PROVIDING A SAFE ETHICALLY SOURCED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY FOR USE IN VETERINARY PRACTICE. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS AND THESE ARE SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD BANKS IN THE SENSE THAT IT ALLOWS BLOOD COLLECTION FROM PETS WHOSE OWNERS HAVE VOLUNTARILY CONSENTED TO THE DONATION. CURRENTLY THIS VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED APPROACHES AND ALLOWED IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REQUIRES ANIMAL BLOOD TO COME FROM SO CALLED CLOSED COLONY BLOOD BANKS. THESE ARE BLOOD BANKS THAT SOURCE BLOOD FROM ANIMALS CAPPED HOUSED AND MAINTAINED OR MAINTAINED AT A FACILITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING THEIR BLOOD. THESE CLOTHES QUALITY BLOOD BANKS REQUIRE HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS TO BE IN CAGES FOR YEARS WHILE THEIR BLOOD IS ROUTINELY HARVESTED WITH ANIMAL BLOOD DEMANDS ONLY INCREASING IN THE STATE. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT CLOSE CALLING THE CONDITIONS THAT KEEP DOGS CAGED IN TIGHT SPACES DEPRIVED OF EXERCISE AND MENTAL STIMULATION. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO ALLOWS FOR A MORE HUMANE SOLUTION FOR SOURCING ANIMAL BLOOD WHILE ALSO ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS TO EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT CAPTIVE CLOSE COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS OVER THE YEARS. THE BILL NOW INSURERS THAT COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS FOLLOWED THE BEST MOST RECENT CLINICAL PRACTICES AND STANDARDS FOR VETERINARY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND DIRECTS THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. TO UPON APPROPRIATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE HIRE A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR VETERINARIANS TO FOLLOW WHEN OPERATING COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS. THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS LEGISLATION OF THE VETERINARIANS MUST HAVE RELIABLE SOURCES OF BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS TO SAVE THE LIVES OF DOGS AND CATS IN OUR HOSPITALS. ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS ENSURING THAT BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE ONCE THIS LAWS IMPLEMENTED AND THE QUALITY OF THESE PRODUCTS IS MAINTAINED. AND MY STAFF AND I ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE C. VMA AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FINDING THE APPROPRIATE TRIGGER FOR THE PHASE OUT OF THE CLOSE COLONY MODEL. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WOULD EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT AND ELIMINATE THE USE OF CAPTIVE CLOSED COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA ONCE IT IS DETERMINED. THAT THE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS ARE PRODUCING EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE SUPPLY OF BLOOD THAT'S PRODUCED BY CAPTIVE BLOOD BANKS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SENATOR WILL CAN I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PASSIONATELY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS WIL BE THE YEAR THAT VETERINARIANS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND THE AFFECTED STATE DEPARTMENTS CAN ALL AGREE THAT AN ETHICALLY SOURCED SAFE. AND EXPANDED ANIMAL SUPPLY ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY FOR VETERINARY USE IS NECESSARY AND INDEED POSSIBLE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO PASSED OUT OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY LAST WEEK AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT THE VET MATT BOARD VOTED FIVE TO TWO TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND FUNDED. CALLING IN THIS MORNING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE DOCTOR CAN PAWLOWSKI CLINICAL DIRECTOR AT INSIGHT VETERINARY WELLNESS CENTER. AND DR JEANINE BERGER SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESCUE AND WELFARE AT THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- WITH THAT YEAH WE DO HAVE- WHEN THIS IS SUPPORT OPERATOR CAN YOU- MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACT AS WITNESSES PLEASE. BUT LINES ARE OPEN THANK YOU. THIS IS DOCTOR CLOUT YEAH I WILL GO AHEAD AND START IF THAT'S OKAY YES PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M TESTIFYING TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO TO HELP INCREASE AND ASSURE THE ADEQUATE SAFE SUPPLY OF CANINE BLOOD PREVENTING HEARING NEEDS IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM FOR HIS PERSEVERANCE AND PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. MY NAME IS DOCTOR CAN'T ALLOW SKI AND I AM A VETERINARIAN LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR AND OWNER AT INSIGHT THAT IN A WELLNESS CENTER. IT'S MALL ANIMAL HOSPITAL IN BOULDER RADO HILLS PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR EMERGENCY CARE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHT VETERINARIANS INCLUDING A FULL TIME BOARDED CRITICAL US APART TIME INTERNIST AND CONTRACTED CARDIOLOGISTS AND SURGEONS. PRIOR TO OPENING OUR NEW HOSPITAL LAST YEAR WE ON TO BANFIELD HOSPITALS DAYTIME GENERAL PRACTICES IN THOSE HOSPITALS ARE NEED FOR BLOOD WAS VERY RARE AND IF WE DID NEED IT WE WOULD USUALLY COLLECTED FROM ONE OF OUR STAFF AT. WHO WAS MORE CRITICAL WILL BE REFERRED TO AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL. NOW IS AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL IS A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME. WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE WILL NEED BLOOD OR BLOOD PRODUCTS BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE PETS IN NEED OFTEN REQUIRING MULTIPLE UNITS THAT WE HAD ONE MASS REMOVAL SURGERY RECENTLY THAT ENDED UP BEING FOUR UNITS OF WHOLE BLOOD FOR PACKED RBCS. AND FOUR UNITS OF CLASS MY- AFTER USING OUR IN HOUSE LAST NIGHT IN YOUR HEAD A BLOOD CLOT FROM ATTACK. DOT WE BORROWED AND PLASMA THREE OTHER BIRDS HOUSE. INCLUDING ONE ALL THE WAY OUT FAIRFIELD. EFFECTIVELY WIPING OUT THE BLOOD SUPPLY IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. THIS FORCES US TO MAKE HARD CHOICES BETWEEN WHICH PATIENTS WILL BE G. BLOOD PRODUCTS. THERE SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH BLOOD TO THE PATIENTS WHO NEED IT. WELL I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE CONCERN FOR THE DOG CONFINED TO THE TOO CLOSE COUNTY BLOOD BANKS. MY BIGGER CONCERNS RELATED BE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR PATIENTS. THE TWO COMPANIES SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF CRITICALLY ILL AND INJURED PETS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD BANK AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE BLOOD AVAILABLE TO OUR PATIENTS. IN ADDITION IT WILL ALLOW US TO IMPORT THESE PRODUCTS FROM OUT OF STATE AS LONG AS THEY MEET OUR SAFETY STANDARDS. WE ALSO NEED TO BE ASSURED THAT BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS COMING FROM ALL THESE SOURCES REMAIN SAFE. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT SURPRISING GUIDELINES THE STAB MR SURE NOT ONLY AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY IT ALSO IS A SUPPLY. I TRULY HOPE THAT NONE OF YOUR PET AND WE NEED THE TRANSFUSION. BUT IF THEY WOULD WHAT DO YOU WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE'S ONE AVAILABLE TURNOUT. RESULT HI AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU MMHM. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- NEXT WITH THIS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR JEAN BERGER AND I'M A LICENSED CALIFORNIA THAT MARION AND THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESCUE AND WELFARE FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA. THROUGH UC DAVIS I AM BOARD CERTIFIED WITH BOTH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF IT NAY BEHAVIORIST AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF ANIMAL WELFARE. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I HAVE OVERSEEING ALL ASPECTS OF CLINICAL BEHAVIOR AND WELFARE PROGRAMS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO VOTE I AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO TO MODERNIZE CALIFORNIA'S ANIMAL BLOOD BANKING INDUSTRY. VETERINARIANS AND THE PUBLIC ON CREE SINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE STATUS STATUS OF ANIMALS IN SOCIETY. THESE CHANGES HAVE IMPACTED MOST AREAS OF VETERINARY PRACTICE INCLUDING THE K. NINE BLOCK BANKING INDUSTRY. THE CURRENT SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA IS EGREGIOUSLY ON BALANCE BLOOD DONORS DOGS ARE KEPT CONFINED FOR MONTHS OR YEARS IN APPALLING CONDITIONS. FORTUNATELY IN A MOVE THAT RECOGNIZES THE INTRINSIC NEEDS OF THESE DOGS MANY BLOOD BANKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE TRANSITIONED FROM CLOSE COLONY PROGRAMS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT COLLECT BLOOD FROM PRE SCREENED HEALTHY FAMILY PET. WITH ESTABLISHED AND SUCCESSFUL PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS PROCESS THE NECESSARY EDUCATION AND SKILLS TO MODERNIZE THIS INDUSTRY IN WAYS THAT ARE PRACTICAL SAFE AND HUMANE. WE ARE EAGER TO WORK TOGETHER AS A PROFESSION TO MAKE COMMUNITY BROUGHT BLOOD BANKS THE STANDARD OF CARE. THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA ALREADY HAVE TO SPACE AND CAPACITY TO COLLECT BLOOD. CALIFORNIA STATE LAW MUST FIRST LAY OUT THE FRAMEWORK THAT BALANCES THE INTERESTS AND WELL BEING OF DONOR ANIMALS RECIPIENT ANIMALS AND VETERINARIANS WHO NEED ACCESS TO HEALTHY BLOOD SUPPLY. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN TRANSITION THE REMAINING CLOSE COLONY BLOOD BANKS TO COMMUNITY MODEL. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS ARE STATE. AT THE- PRACTICAL AND BENEFICIAL TO THE DONOR RECIPIENT AND THEIR OWNERS I URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- WE DO HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- WE HAVE- DR JEAN DODDS OF PRESIDENT OF HAM- PAT AND- CHARLES BERMAN GENERAL COUNSEL FOR HIM A PET SO. THOSE WITNESSES ARE- READY. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO YES PROVIDE OKAY FANTASTIC. THIS IS STUTTERING DOGS I'M THE DIRECTOR AND CREATOR OF HIM OKAY I'M NONPROFIT ANIMAL BLOOD BANK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU CHERRY WAS ON THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK- ABOUT THIS BILL. I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS BECAUSE WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SHORTAGE OF BLOOD SUPPLY FOR PETS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE HOWEVER. I INVITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROOM AND ANYBODY ELSE INCLUDING THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS TO COME AND VISIT OUR FACILITY BECAUSE I AM TOTALLY AGHAST THAT ANYBODY WOULD SAY THE CONDITIONS WE HAVE ARE APPALLING. WITHOUT SIDE LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN FORTY YEARS AS AN EXPERT IN TRANSFUSION MEDICINE IN BOTH HUMAN. AND ANIMAL BUT MAKING I RAN A REGULATED THE STATE OF NEW YORK'S BLOOD SUPPLY. AT THE TIME OF THE AIDS CRISIS I WAS WELL AWARE AT THAT TIME THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SIMILAR BLOOD BANKS FOR ANIMALS THAT TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION. THE HEALTH. AND THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF THE DONORS BUT ALSO OF THE RECIPIENTS. IN ADDITION TO OUR WRITTEN. TESTIMONY ABOUT AB ONE TWO EIGHT TWO- WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE ANIMALS OF A PARTICULAR SIZE A PARTICULAR- AGE AND ALSO TRACTABLE. COMMUNITY DONORS OKAY THAT'S CLEAR. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE. POTENTIAL OF THESE COMMUNITY DONORS. SO EVEN THOUGH THESE ANIMALS MAY BE HEALTHY AND MAY BE SCREENED OCCASIONALLY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT COULD BE TRANSMITTED BY BLOOD. THEY NEED TO BE TESTED THE BLOOD FROM THOSE ANIMALS NEEDS TO BE TESTED EVERY TIME THEY PROVIDE A DONATION WHETHER IT BE TWO THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR. THAT'S BECAUSE HEALTHY ANIMALS CAN CARRY INFECTIOUS VIRUSES FOR EXAMPLE. DEBILITATED OR ILL PATIENT COULD SUCCUMB TO SHOULD THEY BE TRANSMITTED INCLUDING THINGS LIKE EVEN HEARTWORM DISEASE. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLOOD IS CHECKED THAT THE DON'T RESPECT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PARTICIPATE IN SUFFERING AND EVEN GOD FORBID DEATH OF A EAST FELLOW RECIPIENTS- SECONDLY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE STANDARDS FOR THE PROPOSED- AB ONE TWO EIGHT TWO- REGULATIONS WE NEED TO HAVE AN ADVISORY GROUP. OF EXPERTS THAT COULD BE FORMED AND BE AVAILABLE TO SET THE STANDARDS OF HOW WE WOULD DO THIS EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY. WE NEED TO HAVE THIS ADVISORY BOARD AVAILABLE NOW AND TO BE CONTINUING AS AN ENTITY TO HELP US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE EFFECT OF THESE REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS AS THEY ARE DEVELOPED SHOULD BE MONITORED INFO I REQUEST I'M I'M AVAILABLE SHOULD ANYBODY NEED MY HELP IN THIS REGARD SO I REQUEST THAT BEFORE WE ACCEPT AB ONE TWO EIGHT TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THAT WE OPPOSE IT UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE CONSIDERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I AM I AM THE NEXT THAT. WITNESS MY NAME IS CHARLES BERMAN I'M THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF HIM A BIT. I'VE BEEN THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR HIM A BIT FOR THIRTY FIVE YES- I WANT TO STATE. AND THANK YOU AS WELL AS THE CHAIR RIVAS AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US OUT ON THIS ISSUE. I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WANT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO KNOW IT IN THE OPERATION OF HIM UP AT FOUR THIRTY FIVE YES THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A SINGLE COMPLAINT. LODGED AGAINST THE MEDICAL QUALITY OF THE BLOOD PRODUCED BY HUMAN AT. SO WHY HIM A PATH AND I- APPROVE. BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK. WE THAT IT'S IMPLEMENTATION AS PROPOSED IN TWELVE EIGHTY TWO IS SERIOUSLY LACKING IN THAT ANALYSIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. THE BELL AT SET UP NOW IS RIPE FOR LITIGATION AND LIABILITY NOT ONLY TO THE OFFICE BUT TO THE STATE TO THE DONUTS TO THE VET TO THE RECIPIENTS WHO WILL BE GETTING THIS PLOT IF LEAD MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE DONUT THAT IS NOT PROPERLY CARED FOR AS HAS BEEN ADDRESS BY DOCTOR DR. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE RIPE FOR LITIGATION ALL OVER THE MAP AND THEY'RE THE KIND OF LITIGATION THAT COULD RESULT IS FOR PAIN SUFFERING AND DEATH TO THE RECIPIENT ANIMAL WE NEED. NOT REALLY HAVE TO TALK MUCH ABOUT THE LITIGATION CENTRIC. ASPECT OF OXIDE. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HE MIGHT PET HAS INVITED THE AUTHOR AND HE STOPPED AND A CO AUTHOR SENATOR WILL COME TO HIM A BIT UNANNOUNCED AT ANY TIME. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS THIS BILL NOT ONCE.

WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THE- OKAY MEDITATION THE- THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS.

IT'S SAD SAD COMMENTARY ON THE POSITION PUT FORWARD BY THIS PROBLEM. SO HAVING SAID THAT THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS BEING PRESENTED NOW FOR THE THIRD YEAR RUNNING DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY SHOULD POTS IF IN FACT THE DISTRAUGHT.

FINE SEVENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JEFFREY LEE **** ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK- THE OTHER BLOOD BANK LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE BLOOD. WHITE THE PROPONENTS AND OUR FELLOW BLOOD BANK WE SHARE THE GOAL OF OPENING UP THE MARKET TO COMMUNITY BLOOD FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAVE BEEN BLOOD BANKS THE DEMAND FOR BLOOD HAS EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY- THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COLONY BLOOD BANK- MODEL IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND MOST ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF BLOOD ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF- THE LICENSING AND REGULATIONS THAT EXIST NONETHELESS WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL OF THE BILL WE DO HAVE TWO CONCERNS THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THEIR BOTH RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE TRIGGER WHEN YOU WOULD BEGIN TO WIND DOWN PROCESS OF COLONY BASED PRODUCTION- AS THE BILL IS. DRAFTED BAPTIST NUMBER SO WHETHER IT BE ONE TEN OR A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW- IF COMMUNITY BLOOD HITS THAT TRIGGER AMOUNT- WHICH WOULD AT THAT POINT ONLY BE HALF OF THE TOTAL BLOOD IN THE MARKET. THE TRIGGER LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE QUALITY BASED PRODUCTION AND TWELVE MONTHS LATER- THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER WE THINK THAT THE TRIGGER AMOUNT NEEDS TO BE A DYNAMIC NUMBER- BASED ON A ROLLING AVERAGE OF PRIOR YEARS. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT ONCE THE TRIGGER IS PULLED THAT THE RAMP DOWN NEEDS TO BE GRADUAL AND NOT- MEDIA. SO THAT THERE'S A CHANCE FOR COMMUNITY BLOOD PRODUCTION TO GROW TO REPLACE THE REDUCTION. THE OTHER ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE STANDARDS FOR PRODUCING FAKE BLOOD AND- WE SEE NO REASON TO REFERENCE AB H. TM- WE HAVE AGREED TO THE EXISTING CONSENSUS STATEMENT BUT THE FACT IS IF YOU'RE FINDING A POSITION THAT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD TO ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICES. THAT PERSON CAN LOOK AT WHATEVER'S AVAILABLE AND MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO BEST PRACTICES THE STATE OUGHT NOT TO BE DELEGATING AUTHORITY OVER- BLOOD BANKING PRACTICES TO THESE PRIVATE ENTITIES PARTICULARLY NOT AB H. TìM. WHICH IS A FINE ORGANIZATION BUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STANDARD SETTING- AND IS VERY SMALL. OKAY WELL LET YOU MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE WILL BE YOUR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO- EMAIL- HI COMMITTEE WE'D BE HAPPY TO- EXCEPT THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL. OPERATOR THANK YOU. YES WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU MA'AM OPERATOR AND WITH THAT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS PRESSURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER BLOOM- THAT I KNOW WE'VE BEEN DEBATING THIS ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN YOUR EFFORTS ON IT- THE A TRUST WITH- YOUR NEGOTIATIONS MOVE FORWARD. YOU'RE THE WORKING ON. I TO GETTING SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING FOR THIS TRIGGER MECHANISM THAT'S- CONCERN. IS THAT- CAN I GET A COMMITMENT FROM YOU THAT YOU EXACTLY THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT REMAINS UNDER DISCUSSION AND- I'LL COMMIT TO- THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ALONG WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO- SEE WHAT RESOLUTION WE CAN COME UP WITH THE WITH YOUR COMMITMENT TO DO THAT ALL LIVE HAPPILY COME ON AS A CO AUTHOR WITH YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AS LONG AS IT'S AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF WHAT'S TRANSPIRED HERE THAT THERE WAS A PREVIOUS VERSIONS THIS BILL THAT WENT FURTHER INTO MARCH IS BANNING THE PRACTICE IS THAT RIGHT NOW WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR OR UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. I DON'T WANT TO MISREPRESENT THE DETAILS OF THAT BILL- BUT I OKAY WELL THAT I BELIEVE THE VERSION THAT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK DID AND THE GOVERNOR IN HIS VETO MESSAGE SUPPORTED THE INTENTION OF THAT BILL- WHILE THE DOING IT. SO I GUESS WHAT OCCURS TO ME IS THAT THE FINAL ISSUE HERE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THERE IS FACILITIES- WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE TODAY SUGGESTING THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE- LESS THAN APPROPRIATE OR UNSAFE FOR. OR HAVE SOME POOR TREATMENT. OF THE ANIMALS IN THOSE FACILITIES. I DON'T HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE. THAT THAT'S TRUE OR NOT TRUE- BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY THE ASSERTION. CALL PLEASE HANG UP AND TRY AGAIN. MISTER BLOOM BETTER WITH. THAT WAS DIRECTED AT YOU SIR SHOULD. AND THE- I GUESS CHRISTMAS WHAT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME IS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THESE KIND OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS OPERATED BY YOUR LOCAL VETERINARIANS. WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE SOLUTION THEN MOVING FORWARD WITH AUTHORIZING THAT ACTIVITY AND ALLOWING THOSE COMMITTEE BLOOD TO. OCCUR AND THEN HOPEFULLY GROW RIGHT BECAUSE I AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE ONE OF THE REASONS THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE ORIGINAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT THERE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT IF WE MOVED TO COMMITTEE BLOOD BANKS WITHOUT THESE FACILITIES THAT THERE MIGHT BE. A SHORTAGE OF SUPPLY- I THINK THAT'S EVERYONE'S CONCERN OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SHORTAGE OF BLOOD AND THAT'S WHY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE- TRIGGERS WOULD BE AND THAT IS ISSUE IS. CONTINUING TO BE UNDER DISCUSSION OF LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND OUT ITALY WILL BE MODIFIED AND- HOPEFULLY IN KEEPING WITH A CONSENSUS THAT CAN BE. REACHED ON- WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH WE CAN TRANSITION OUT OF THE- CURRENT LARGELY CLOSE TO QUALITY SYSTEM. TO THE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK A MODEL. WHY IS THAT NO GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE FOR ME IS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL- TRIGGERS AND- AUTHORIZATION. TO SHUT DOWN THESE FACILITIES RATHER THAN APPROACHING THE PROBLEM FROM LET'S CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS. LET'S TAKE THE PROPER STEPS TO- YOU KNOW GET PUBLICITY AND SUPPORT TO THOSE EFFORTS IN THE HOPES THAT PEOPLE WILL UTILIZE THEM. AND THAT THOSE WILL BECOME SELF SUSTAINING WON'T NEED THESE OTHER SELLERS THAT'LL MAKE SENSE. THEN IN A SUBSEQUENT SESSION IF WE WANT TO COME BACK AND LOOK AT PHASING OUT THOSE FACILITIES THAT SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION AT THAT TIME. BUT TO DO IT HERE IN THE WAY- WERE KIND OF POINTING. OUT TO THE AGENCIES AND- AND SENDING ALL THIS WITHOUT HAVING ALL THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF US BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU HADN'T HAVE INCLUDING YOUR BILL COLLECTION OF QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION THAT SEEMS APPROPRIATE AND HELPFUL- SO I GUESS. WHAT I'M DRIVING AT HERE IS IF YOU WERE TO REMOVE THE- WHAT WHAT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE THE PREMATURE- ELIMINATION OF THESE FACILITIES FROM THE BILL AND JUST FOCUS ON THE COMMITTEE BLOOD BANKS AND THE- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAKE A TON OF SENSE. I FEEL LIKE I COULD SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WITH THE OTHER PROVISION IN THERE- IT LEAVES ME WITH SOME CONCERN- REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY BLOOD SUPPLY AND YOU KNOW IT. REMINDS ME OF WHAT CENTER RIGHT RIGHT USED TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BILL THE FIRST QUESTION IS THERE A PROBLEM. WELL I WOULD ARGUE MAYBE MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED. DOES THIS LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF US OFFER A SOLUTION. I THINK PARTIALLY IT OFFERS A SOLUTION CERTAINLY SETS SOME OF THE PIECES IN PLACE AND THEN THE THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION IS A SOLUTION WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM. AND THE JURY'S OUT ON THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE- THIS PROVISION. TO DISCONTINUE THESE FACILITIES- PREMATURELY- SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO. TAKE THAT OUT- WORK ON THESE OTHER PIECES NO WE WOULD NOT AND TO- THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT- THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON TWO GOALS- ONE GOAL IS TO SHIFT TO A MORE HUMANE- BLOOD. DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT TO OF- AT THAT IS THE COMMUNITY BLOOD DONOR MODEL- AT THE SAME TIME IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE CLOSE QUALITY MODEL- IS. A FAR LESS THAN IDEAL FOR THE ANIMALS WHO WERE INVOLVED AND SO THE IMPORTANCE OF SHIFTING OUT OF THAT MODEL UNDER THE PROPER CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS DETAIL IN THE BILL THAT. LAYS OUT WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE AND THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING GUN- IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE- THAT THE TRIGGER LANGUAGE THAT'S WHY THAT PART OF THE BILLS IN THERE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AND THE BILL RECOGNIZES IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE GOALS NOT JUST ONE IF WE- WEEK. DO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN PRIOR VERSIONS OF THIS BILL- THAT WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL THAT- THAT DID SPLIT OFF THESE ISSUES- BUT BY SPLITTING OFF THE ISSUE YOU'RE REALLY DELAYING- AN ISSUE REGARDING THE WELL BEING AND THE HEALTH. OF FOLK OF THESE ANIMALS. IN THE CLOSE CALL IN THE SYSTEM I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS TESTIMONY THAT THERE'S NO PROBLEM THERE BUT THERE'S NO DENYING THE FACT THAT THE CLOSE CALL IN THE SYSTEM. REQUIRES DOGS TO BE KEPT IN CONFINEMENT- ON PREMISES THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS AND WE WANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT MODEL AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME AND NOT PUT THAT OFF TO SOME- DISTANT DATE. IN THE FUTURE THAT'S ON CERTAIN. SHE THAT INFORMATION HAVE VISIT THE CALL TO. ARE AND THE PAPERS THAT I HAVE NOT YOU HAVE NOT. BUT WE KNOW WHAT THE FACT YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OVER. WHETHER DOGS ARE TREATED HUMANELY ARE NOT ON PROMISES WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT SYSTEM AND IS IRREFUTABLE IS THAT DOGS ARE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY FOR YEARS ON END. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS MOST CRUCIAL TO ADD. I'M NOT SURE WERE ARE. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- IN AGREEMENT THERE BUT- IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE MEMBER I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING- THE BILL THIS AFTERNOON I APPRECIATE- AND HAVE EVERY BIT OF FAITH AND TRUST IN YOU AS A COLLEAGUE AND KNOW THAT YOU DO GOOD WORK BUT THE- UNFORTUNATE BAD HABIT THIS INSTITUTION. HAS DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS AS WE- OPERATE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH LIKE A BILL FACTORY JUST MOVE BILLS ALONG ONE WE'VE IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND WE DON'T RESOLVE THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN FRONT OF US I AM IN SOME CASES THAT'S FOR REASONS YOU KNOW SOME COMMITTEES AT DIFFERENT MAKE UPS ON THE FLOOR AND HEN WE GET INTO. DISAGREEMENTS IDEOLOGICALLY SOMETIMES IT'S TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO MOVE IT TO THE NEXT STEP- RATHER THAN FACE THE MUSIC IN A PARTICULAR COMMITTEE SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND LOBBYIST FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT- APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS THANK YOU AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S IN PLAY HERE. ASSEMBLY ONE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GERMAN RIVAS OF THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLOOMY YOU KNOW I'VE HAD ISSUES WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF YOUR BILL BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNED WITH- SUPPLY I THINK THIS BILL WENT MUCH FURTHER IN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLIES THERE BUT I'M I HEARD ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TALK ABOUT THE TRIGGER IS THAT ONE HALF THE SUPPLY. IS FURNISHED BY THESE COMMUNITY- BANKS THEN THE PHASE THAT WOULD START AND I YOU KNOW I'M JUST NOT REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT THE ACTUAL TRIGGER IS IT LIKE THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A PREMATURE TRICK SO I THINK THAT'S A REFERENCE TO- THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE BILL CURRENTLY THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT- WE WILL BE TAKING AND THERE ARE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT WAS SAID ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THIS QUESTION AND- OF MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE. AT THAT PROCESS I THINK I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE SOME OF- GOOD WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION THAT WE HAVE A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD A- BLOOD SHORTAGE FOR THESE STUFF BUT NERI THANK YOU I DON'T THINK THAT- ISN'T ANY BUDDIES. BEST INTEREST. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GET FREE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM- I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU JUST TO CONSIDER THE TWO ISSUES THAT CAME UP BY THE OPPOSITION THE TRIGGER. AND HOW THAT'LL WORK. AND CONSIDER THE BILL'S ROLE THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE JUST LIKE YOU TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION ON THAT- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING HARD ON THIS AND THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. ANIMALS HAVE GOOD HEALTHY BLOOD THAT THERE IF THERE'S A TRANSFUSION- SO WITH THAT- I APPRECIATE YOU WOULD CONSIDER THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY. AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU AND WE WILL DO THAT. K.
