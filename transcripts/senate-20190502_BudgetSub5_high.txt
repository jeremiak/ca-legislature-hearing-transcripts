AND AS FOLKS COME. WE'VE HAD. A GOOD DISCUSSION -- ON THE APPS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF APPS WHEN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL -- WAS HERE OF COURSE THAT'S WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THERE'S BEEN -- CONCERNS REGARDING BACKLOG THERE WE DID GET A GOOD DISCUSSION THAT BUT THERE IS ALSO -- WE HAD A GOOD -- I WILL CALL IT A DEBATE BUT THE DISCUSSION AROUND HOW WE OPTIMIZE -- I THINK -- FIVE EIGHT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE. IS VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR WERE. APPS PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR ARMS PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST IS. REALLY ENFORCED AND SO WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THAT FULL ENFORCEMENT. AND WE IN THAT DISCUSSION RECOGNIZED THAT WELL WE HAVE A GREAT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. LIVE IT LEGITIMATE LEAD BECAUSE IT'S A STATEWIDE AGENCY IT HAS PRESENTS OUR OFFICES IN OUR THE THE NUMBER OF BOXES IN THE PRESENCE ACROSS STATE IS LIMITED. AND SO THE ABILITY FOR THE OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THAT ENFORCEMENT UNIT WHO ARE JUST DO J.. TO FULLY DO THE ARM. THE ENFORCEMENT IS OF COURSE IT'S PUT TAXES THEM. AND SO THERE WAS DISCUSSION THAT ALREADY IT IS IN OUR CODE THAT -- THAT OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE APPS ADDITIONALLY. AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS WANT TO ENSURE AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT THEIR SOMETIMES A LAG TIME. BEFORE THE HERE FROM OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SAFE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. DID -- GO TO A A PERSON ON THE APPS LIST AND REMOVE. WEAPONS FROM THEM -- THAT THEI SOMETIMES A LACK TIME SO WE WANT TO OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT THE FEELING WAS THAT IF OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN ASSIST US. IN. MAKING SURE THAT OUR APPS -- THAT IT IS FULLY ENFORCED THE NASA BENEFIT AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN. VARIOUS PROPOSALS AND DISCUSSIONS FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS THAT THEY COULD PLAY A LARGER ROLE. SO THE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE SOME FUNDING TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES. TO BETTER PARTNER WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS SO THAT WAS THE WHAT THE PROPOSAL WAS BUT CERTAINLY -- CENTER MORE LIKE YOU OF COURSE CAN -- RAISE ANY ISSUES OR ASKING QUESTIONS AND IF WE DO YES PLEASE COME TO THE TABLE [inaudible] DOJ. PERHAPS AND YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES SO IF ANY OF US DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WE CAN -- RAISE THEM TO YOU -- MANAGER CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND MARTIN WHO RAN FROM THE BUREAU FIREARMS AND JUST FOR POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON OUR AGENDA ITEM TEN HAD BEEN THE FORENSIC LABORATORY EQUIPMENT PROPOSAL. AND ITEM EIGHT WAS THE APPS PROGRAMS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE APPS PROGRAM AND WE'RE READY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS WE ALSO HAVE -- VERY HERE WHO CAN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DNA LAB AS WELL. EIGHT MY APOLOGIES SO I NEED TO SEE THE GENDER THAT THE REST THE PUBLIC AS BECAUSE I IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THE FIRST TWO PAGES THAT HAVE THE YES THAT'S WHAT I'M. GETTING I DON'T HAVE THE UPDATED BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS IT DOES SHOW ISSUE TEN ARMED PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEMS INVESTIGATION OKAY PERFECT WE WE HAVE AN EARLIER VERSION OKAY. BUT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BECAUSE SINCE THE MOTIONS THAT I TOOK EARLIER WERE ALL BASED ON ISSUE ITEM IF IT WAS THE WRONG ATTENDED IT WE WOULD HAVE TO RE VOTE. BUT I'M GLAD WE CLARIFIED THAT SO -- AND APOLOGIES THAT ON THE AGENDA WAS OF COURSE CHANGED SINCE YOU RECEIVE THAT ONE BUT AT LEAST IT'S THE SAME ITEM BUT GO AHEAD I MEAN IT WHETHER IT'S NUMBERED. IT'S AT LEAST THE SAME ISSUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE SO YES YOU'RE VERY THREE GUYS I THINK WE WERE THERE WAS A QUESTION BOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD -- BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL I TINK AS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ACTION IS TO REJECT. THE APPS ROSAL THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPS PROPOSAL. AND THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL AND THAT THERE WAS AN ITEM IN HERE ADDING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CONDUCT APPS AND AND THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF THE PROPOSAL [inaudible] CORRECT. SO IS THE QUESTION HOW WOULD THAT FILM WITH HONOR ON SENATOR MORE LIKE FIRST MISTER RYAN. I DON'T AGREE WITH THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION. SO CAN HAVE SOME FUN. ABSOLUTELY CENTER MORE LOCAL -- YOU KNOW HAVING MET WITH YOUR BOSS -- IT STRIKES ME THAT HIS REQUESTS ARE [inaudible] CREDIBLE -- I'M -- LEANING TOWARDS WHAT YOU PROPOSED AND NOT. THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION -- BUT IT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT YOUR YOUR BOSS IS NEW TO A THE% ROLE OF A DEPARTMENT HEAD WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE -- BUT I'VE BEEN A DEPARTMENT HEAD SO I CAN APPRECIATE ALL THE FUN. WHEN YOU STEP INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN BEING A LEGISLATOR NOW YOU'RE AN EXECUTIVE SO -- HE NEEDS HELP BUDGET WISE HE NEEDS HELP STAFFING WISE YOU CERTAINLY COULD WORK A LITTLE MORE WITH HR. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OPERATING THE A. P. P. S. ARE COMPENSATED. APPROPRIATELY AND I THINK THAT I KNOW THAT'S A BUDGET. TERRY KIND OF THING THAT'S MORE ABOUT [inaudible] MINISTERIAL OPPORTUNITY. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS IT CONCERNS AS WELL SO ON AND NONE OF THOSE WERE DRESSED IN THE STAFF [inaudible] RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] SO. I WILL BE OPPOSED. BUT MY CONCERN IS IS THAT WE GET THESE FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THEM. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAY BE MENTALLY ILL. AND WE CERTAINLY HAD THE BORDERLINE. INCIDENT THOUSAND OAKS IN NOVEMBER YOU KNOW SEEM DESERVE SOMEONE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. POSSESSING FIREARMS SO I THOUGHT MAN I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW IF IF IF I'M ACTION A QUESTION I'M MAKING A STATEMENT ON ON ON HIGHER I RESPECT YOUR PROPOSAL BUT I DISAGREE. WITH IT AND MISTER RYAN IF YOU WOULD DARE RESPOND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. WELL AB MASSA DIRECTOR HER AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE FIRES PROGRAM SURE -- WELL I I APPRECIATE AND AND OF COURSE RESPECT YOUR YOUR DECISIONS IN YOUR OPINIONS ON THIS MATTER -- I THINK WE'RE ALL AFTER THE SAME GOAL HERE AND THAT IS TO HAVE FIREARMS REMOVED FROM THE POSSESSION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PROHIBITED AND THAT IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR APPS PROGRAM ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE -- IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE. AND THE NUMBERS JUST CONTINUE TO GROW EVEN THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY AT THOSE NUMBERS BUT SOME SOME IMPORTANT NUMBERS TO TO NOTE AND THEY WERE IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. WERE WE WENT FROM IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND ONE POINT FOUR MILLION KNOWN ARMED INDIVIDUALS TO NOW TWO POINT FIVE MILLION MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF US WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ARMS AND PROHIBITED PEOPLE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE HAD OVER SIX THOUSAND ACTIVE ARMED FOLKS -- AND PROHIBITED FOLKS IN ACCOUNTING WE CURRENTLY HAVE -- ONE I WANT I WANT TO SAY IT'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUGHLY. FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND WE ARE WORKING WITH LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ON A DAILY BASIS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO NINE MONTHS STRAIGHT. SO YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ARE COMING DOWN BUT IT'S A SLOW AND GRADUAL PROCESS BECAUSE AGAIN AS WE TALKED BEFORE AND IT'S IN THE REPORT. IS ROUGHLY A THOUSAND NEW PROHIBITED PERSONS ARE ADDED TO THAT LIST SO EVEN THOUGH WERE ATTACKING IT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN WE'RE BEING SAFE -- WAR WAR REDUCING THOSE NUMBERS BY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED A MONTH. SO WERE WERE TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP BAY AND THE AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY WE HAVE THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THERE. FOR THIS THE STAFFING AND THE FUNDING AND A LOT OF THESE POSITIONS ARE POSITIONS THAT WE DID HAVE AFTER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BUT THEY WENT AWAY. AFTER THE FUNDING SO WE'RE HAVING A HARDER AND HARDER TIME KEEPING UP WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WE USED TO JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THAT AS WELL -- IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I KNOW YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT WE FEEL THAT WAY -- WEEK WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WORKING -- OVERTIME AND ON WEEKENDS TO TRYING CONTINUE TO PUT THE NUMBERS UP. BETTER EXPECTED. IT'S JUST BECOMING MORE MORE CHALLENGING AND I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S REVIEW OPINION OF EVERYTHING -- WE WE DO WORK WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THEM EVEN MORE SO. SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE -- ENTERTAINING THAT WOULD HELP THAT THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC -- BUT EVEN WITH US WORKING WITH THE LOCALS THE NUMBERS JUST SLOWLY COME DOWN -- SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET HELP WE APPRECIATE IT -- OUR OUR JUSTIFICATION RBC P. STANDS IT'S IT'S REALLY BEEN A MATTER OF TRYING TO HELP YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND HOPEFULLY IT MAKES SENSE -- BUT IT IS A VERY WORTHWHILE IMPORTANT PROGRAM IT IS VERY SUCCESSFUL MAYBE JUST NOT TO THE EXPEDIENCY THAT WE ALL WANT BUT IT'S THE IT'S THE UP HILL BATTLE THAT WERE. WERE FACING. WELL I DID NOT BRING THE REPORT THAT YOU HAD DONE. YOUR YOUR DRESSING THE NUMBER OF NEW REQUEST COMING IN EVERY YEAR BUT WE'RE STILL AT WHAT. TEN THOUSAND ROUGHLY THAT WE STILL. HAVEN'T TO TO TRY AND DRILL THAT DOWN YES SIR OF AN A AND IF I CAN ADDRESS THAT AND IT'S IN THE REPORT AS WELL WE TRIED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC IN CLARIFYING WHAT THAT. BACKLOG WAS SO THAT IT WAS NOT JUST THE RECURRING NUMBER OF CASES THAT WERE WORKING AS FAR AS A BACK WHAT WE WANTED TO CLARIFY. THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN THERE WERE TWENTY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE ACTIVE. CASES THAT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED BOWS OF ALL BEEN WORKS NOW THAT SO THAT ORIGINAL BACKLOG IS NOW GONE SO THE THE CURRENCY NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CASES THAT WE HAD JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT'S OUR CURRENT ACTIVE NUMBER BUT THOSE ARE ALL NEW CASES THAT HAVE. DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND AND CONTINUALLY GETTING ADDED SO AGAIN I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUCCESS FROM THAT ASPECT IT IS SUCCESSFUL. AND ANOTHER THING NOTED IN THE REPORT IS THAT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THERE HAVE BEEN. FIFTY SIX THOUSAND NEW PEOPLE ADDED TO THE ARMS AND PROHIBITED FILE WE HAVE REMOVED. FIFTY THREE THOUSAND WE'RE STILL BEHIND THAT NUMBER THAT CONTINUES TO INCREASE -- SO I HOPE THAT BETTER EXPLAINS THE THE BACKLOG THAT'S GREAT I OKAY I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU OKAY -- I THINK THE AG HAS [inaudible] ONE AREA OF EXPOSURE THAT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING IN THAT IS. IF SOMEONE. IN THAT LIST OF TEN THOUSAND WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS. ACTUALLY MURDER SOMEBODY. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET THAT FIREARM -- IT IS THAT IS A LITTLE TOO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO THE FAMILY. AND IT'S WE'VE HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT POWER AWAY THIS PAST WEEKEND I DON'T KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS ON THE LIST BUT I WANTED TO HELP AS MUCH AS I CAN AS RECENTLY AS I CAN. AND IF YOU COULD CONVINCE SENATOR BELL. TO ALSO POSES THAT WOULD MAKE THIS A VERY FINE. IF I MAKE COMMENTS -- EVERY. RESPOND TO YOUR COMMENT -- I CAN TELL YOU AS BEING THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU FIREARMS ANYTIME THERE IS A SHOOTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY IF IT INVOLVES A DEATH OF SOMEBODY. I SEE THAT IMMEDIATELY I SEE THAT ON THE NEWS MY PHONE IS GOING OFF PHONE CALLS COMING IN EMAILS COMING IN. AND USUALLY THE FIRST RESPONSES OF THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ARE IS THAT SOMEBODY WE KNEW ABOUT IS THAT PERSON ON THE APPS LIST IF SO HOW COME WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND WHEN DID WE LAST VISIT THEM. AND I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU IT IT IT IT'S 95% IF NOT HIGHER. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON ALL OUR ARMED AND PROHIBITED LIST. AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ARM FOR A BIT OF LIST THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE KNOWN. ARMED INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY BECOME PROHIBITED. A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS THAT OCCUR ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE FARMS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT HITTING OUR RADAR. BUT A YOU KNOW A IT'S NOT A GOOD THING BUT IT GIVES ME PEACE AT LEAST FOR MY JOB AS A MANAGER OVER THAT PROGRAM. THAT THAT PERSON THAT COMMITTED THIS HIDEOUS OF AND IS NOT SOMEBODY THAT WE HAVE MISSED -- SO I CAN SAY THAT THAT THAT THAT'S MORE THE COMMONALITY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE INSTANCES THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUESTS WERE. PRECIADO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT THANK YOU JUST A QUICK QUESTION AND I AND I NOTICED THE RECOMMENDATION IS -- TO REJECT THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL AND AND THE LAST HEARING WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT -- OF WHAT FUND SOURCE WOULD COVER THIS PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE RIGHT -- SO I WANTED TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT THE ACTION INCLUDES AS AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE DRESS -- I APPRECIATE THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE STAFF OF REASON ALSO WHAT MY FIRST HERE'S RAISED AND IN OUR DISCUSSION WHEN EIJI WAS HERE. AND IN THE B. C. P. IT SHOWS THAT WHAT'S BEING ASKED FOR IS GENERAL FUND VERSUS THE SPECIAL FUND AND PARTLY IS BECAUSE WE ARE. SO VERY COMMONLY THIS ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE AT LEAST THIS IS MORE TRANSPARENT AND ITS TECHNOLOGY. THAT ARE SPECIAL FUND BALANCE IS GOING DOWN IN WHICH IT IS INADEQUATE. TO AT LEAST IN TERMS OF HOW THE AG FEELS THAT HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEELS THAT. THIS -- WORK SHOULD BE STAFFED IT'S IN ADEQUATE COVERAGE. SO IT'S THAN ASKING ON THE GENERAL FUND SO [inaudible] PART OF THE IT'S NOT ARTICULATED IN THE STAFF ITEM BUT PART OF THE MOTIVATION IS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO? TO LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE IF WE EXPECTED THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT. OF OUR RULES AROUND APPS WOULD BE FUNDED. BY A SPECIAL FIND. HOW HOW CAN WE? WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? THE FIRST IT KNOWLEDGE THAT IT MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADJUST IT. AND RATHER THAN. WE MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO GENERAL FUND BUT RATHER THAN JUST JUMPING TO GENERAL FUND. WHICH OF COURSE IS WE ALL KNOW HAS. THE MOST COST PRESSURES. SO PART OF IT WAS JUST SORT OF PUT IT BACK IN. YOU KNOW HOW WE GOING TO TO TO DOJ THAT. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THE FULL ENFORCEMENT? AND BRING BACK TO US IN THAT REPORT HOW TO DO THAT WITHIN. THE SPECIAL FIND AND IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TEND TO BE UP FRONT NOTE IN A WAY. YOU ARE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEED GENERAL FUND BUT THERE'S NOT A REAL. DISCUSSION AS TO WHY. ADDITIONALLY SO IN JUST HISTORICALLY. THE DEPARTMENT WAS GIVEN TEMPORARY FUNDING IN TEMPORARY POSITIONS FOR THEIR BACKLOG STARTING IN [inaudible] TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THAT FINDING RAN OUT OR EXPIRED AS OF APRIL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD WORK DONE. IN THE BACKLOG DID GET REDUCED. BUT THERE WAS RECOGNITION AT THAT TIME NOW I WAS NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THERE WAS RECORD RECOGNITION AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF NEW PEOPLE ON APPS AND THE TYPE OF WORKLOAD. IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO MAKE THOSE POSITIONS PERMANENT SO TWENTY TWO PERMANENT POSITIONS WERE APPROVED. IN DATA BUDGET YEAR AND THEY ARE STILL THERE WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THOSE THEIR CONTINUING. NOW IN THE REPORT THAT DOJ PROVIDED US SOMETIME AGO IT SHOWED THAT. THERE'S BEEN DIFFICULTY IN RETENTION. AND THAT ALL OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE NOT FELT. SO PART OF AT LEAST MY MOTIVATION WAS ALL RIGHT IF WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND THEY'RE NOT FILLED. WHY? I DON'T QUITE A QUITE SAY WHY. BUT IT'S HARDER TO JUSTIFY GIVING MORE POSITIONS WHEN THERE'S NO CLEAR DE THAT WE CAN EVEN FILL THEM. AND GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAS THE HAS THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS THEN USING MORSE PARTNERS THAT WAS PART OF THE THINKING. NOW. I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. AND TO GIVE IT A RE LOOK. TO SEE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT AT LEAST. WE'VE HEARD FROM MY VICE CHAIR ABOUT THE IT HIS PERSPECTIVE ON IT AND YOU'VE HEARD. THAT AT LEAST IN MY THINKING IT WAS TRYING TO GET AT HOW TO REDUCE OUR GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURES. AND AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS KNOWING THAT WE HAVE VACANCIES IN GIVING MORE POSITIONS DOESN'T NECESSARILY. FILL THE F. T.'S SO. BUT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN. SO THAT WE CAN GIVE SOME MORE THINKING TO THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER OKAY. RIGHT. YES SENATOR BREAUX. I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS WITH THE STAFF. FOR LONGER THAN. BOTH MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- I THINK THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WE KEEP COMING IN AND ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. AND TO MAKE THE STAFF'S PERMANENT. IN MY BLOW AWAY PUT IN AS WE DON'T GET ANY [inaudible] RESULTS. OR WE WE WE ARE TOLD WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME RESULTS THAT WE DON'T ACHIEVE THOSE. SO SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IT. IS OKAY WE'RE LOOKING AT ALLOCATE SOME MONEY HERE. HOW WHAT KIND OF RESULTS WE GOTTA GET? WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE FOR US ARE HOW HOW IS THIS. OF GOING TO ACTUALLY -- ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WHAT'S PERFORMANCE. WHAT PERFORMANCE YOU GONNA GIVE AND I I DON'T I DON'T WANT JUST A BUNCH OF? MADE UP STUFF I WON A REALITY CHECK YOUR HOW MANY HOW MANY VACANCIES YOU HAVE NOW ARE YOU ARE YOU. UNDERSTAFFED NOW ARE YOU NOT PERFORMED BECAUSE OF THAT. AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PASSES WE GAVE MONEY FOR THIS. THE THIS YOU WERE ABLE TO ROUTE TO HIRE PEOPLE YOU HAVE DELAYED DELAYS AND SOME OF THE HIRING AND SO WHEN WHEN THAT HAPPENED THE DELAY HAPPEN. YOU FOR YOU YOU FELL FURTHER BEHIND AND THE NUMBER STARTED GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BECAUSE THEY COME IN EVERY YEAR. HE STARTED FALLING BEHIND YOU WERE KEEPING UP WITH THE WITH THE THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS. THAT SO SO LIKE IF IF -- IF WE ALLOCATE MORE MONEY TO TO YOU. IS -- IT GOING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT. ON REDUCTION. OF THE NUMBERS IF NOT. I WANNA I WANNA I WANT HONEST TRUTH SO I'M I'M LESS WHEN LOOKING FOR MANAGER. PERFORMANCE MAY I COMMENT YES ABSOLUTELY GERMAN NHI&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOU&lt;/c&gt; WILL SEE RESULTS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN RESULTS AND AND IT MAY NOT BE TO THE EXPECTATION THAT YOU YOU HAD. AND MAYBE THERE WAS A MAYBE THERE WAS A IN IN ACCURACY OR YOU WERE LED TO BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY THAN I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS INTENDED. IF THERE WAS EVER A FONT THAT THIS THIS PROGRAMWAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE NUMBERS DOWN. TO ZERO THAT MAY BE IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN THEORY IF ALL THE NUMBERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STAYED THE SAME BUT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN INCREASING -- WE HAD LIMITED TERM POSITIONS I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH TRYING TO FILL THOSE -- I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY ARRANGE TO HAVE A A MEETING WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE NUMBERS AND SORTS STATISTICS HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE HAD A A POSITIVE INC IMPACT AND HAVING THOSE NUMBERS REDUCE -- THE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND STAFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT IN REDUCING THOSE NUMBERS. WHAT I THINK ONE THING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS I DON'T THINK THAT NUMBER WILL EVER BE AT ZERO IN THE REASON I SAY THAT IS WE HAVE THIRTY PEOPLE A DAY OR MORE BEING ADDED TO IT? ROUGHLY A THOUSAND A MONTH. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT TO GET A GLASS SO WE'RE FIGHTING THAT BATTLE -- I THINK WHAT WOULD HELP US ALL UNDERSTAND REALISTICALLY IS WHAT IS A MAINTENANCE LEVEL THAT THAT NUMBER COULD BE AT THAT WE'RE ALL. SOMEWHAT ACCEPTABLE WITH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT I'M ESTIMATING SOMEWHERE IN A FOUR THOUSAND RANGE SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ROUGHLY. NINE THOUSAND ACTIVE ARMED AND FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE STILL TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND PERMANENT POSITIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT WE CAN GET THESE NUMBERS DOWN CLOSER TO SOMETHING MORE MAINTAINABLE. LIKE FOUR THOUSAND ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WITH US WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LOCALS. THAT I THINK IS MORE REALISTIC AND UNDERSTANDABLE TO ALL OF US -- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHETHER IT'S NEW LAWS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED NEW FIREARMS THAT ARE. BEING CONSIDERED -- ILLEGAL WHATEVER'S HAPPENING THAT CAUSES THE NUMBERS INCREASE WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING THAT BATTLE -- SO I I CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT YES I THINK IT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON A THINK WE CAN SHOW THAT. YEAH I THINK -- JUST. HISTORY. ON US. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THE PASS WAS. OKAY OF THIS MODEL OF HIRING MORE STAFF IN DOING THIS. DOESN'T WORK. MAY WE OUGHT TO DO SOME -- RETHINKING OF HOW WE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM MAYBE HAVE. MORE LOCAL PARTNERS ENGAGED IN A FIND OUT WHERE YOUR HOT SPOTS ARE YOU KNOW LIKE WHERE THE THE WORST AREAS ARE MAYBE. HAVE SPECIAL -- I REPROACH IS FOR THOSE AREAS I MEAN YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING. I MEAN PERFORMANCE MAJOR LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF COME IN. AND SAY WE NEED SHOULD WE JUST NEED MORE STAFF THAT DOESN'T. THAT'S WHEN WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT THAT'S A SIGN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT PERFORMANCE. TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE? ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU TRYING TO BE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF CREATING AN OPTION THAT WILL. WILL WILL CUT DOWN THOSE NUMBERS AND AND HELP FOR FOR SO WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE. RUNNING AROUND SHOOTING -- PEOPLE THAT ARE. NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING FIREARMS IN THEIR POSSESSION SO. AND AND AGAIN WE DO WORK WITH THE LOCALS. ALL THE TIME IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN -- FURTHER CONVINCED THEM TO HAVE A AN INTEREST OR DESIRE TO WORK WITH US. AND IF THIS -- THIS INITIATIVE THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS HAVING GRANT FUNDING WILL HELP THAT IN A WAY I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC -- KEEPING IN MIND NEED A LOT OF LOCAL AW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE ALSO FIGHTING FOR FUNDING AND RESOURCES AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO WHEN WE GO OUT AND WORK WITH THEM OFTENTIMES IT WILL BE. THEY ARE REASSIGNING PEOPLE ON OVERTIME TO BE OUT WITH US IT'S NOT THAT THEY CAN PULL SOMEBODY OFF PATROL AND ASSIGNED TO US AND A AND A FULL TIME POSITION. SO JUST LIKE WE ARE SPREAD THIN AND WORKING PEOPLE -- ON OVERTIME AND ON WEEKENDS IT WEARS FOLKS OUT AT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THEY ASSIGN PEOPLE ON OVERTIME TO TO WORK. ON THESE ON THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S BEEN SOME OF THE PROBLEM AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- HIRING IN FILLING SOME OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE SPREAD SO THIN. I THINK OUR AGENTS OR SOME OF THE HARDEST WORKING INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE BUREAU FIREARMS BECAUSE THEY'RE AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED HOURS OF OVERTIME. IN A MONTH THAT WORST PEOPLE OUT AND SOME OTHER AGENTS ARE OUT THERE IN THE CURRENT BUREAUS AT THE RAN DON'T HAVE AN INTERESTING COMING OVER WORKING THAT HARD EVERY MONTH AND BEING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AS MUCH AS OUR FOLKS ARE. THAT'S THE REALITY OF A LOT OF THIS. SO WE WE WILL -- HOLD IT OPEN -- AND I THINK ON YOUR THE REFERENCE YOU MADE TO YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE SOMETIMES FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO ASSIST IF THEY'RE UNDERFUNDED. THAT'S ONE BENEFIT OF TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM SOME RESOURCES TO ASSIST -- BUT WHAT WE LOW COUPLE% POINTS ONE IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CLARIFICATION WHICH I THINK WE ALL DO NEED TO ACCEPT IS THAT. WILL NEVER BE AT ZERO AND WHAT IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IS A REALISTIC TARGET. THAT WE'D WANT TO GET TO SO THAT AS WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACHIEVE IT. THEN WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE THAT WHAT'S THE WORKLOAD THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED AND WHAT IS THEN THE THE BEST -- ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND I THINK WHEN THE AG WAS HERE THERE WAS HE EXPLAINED A LOT OF REASONS WHY IT'S PRETTY HARD TO ACHIEVE ZERO BECAUSE THE PEOPLE AREN'T FOUND THEY'RE NOT AT THE ADDRESS THAT YOU HAVE VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS BOTH NOT ONLY THE REALISTIC. BUT RATHER WHAT IS THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT SO WE CAN FEEL. WHEN WE GET A REPORT THAT REAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE NO I THINK THAT? IN ALL THE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD SO FAR I THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN A. EXPRESSION AND RECOGNITION THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE -- IT OF COURSE WE'D LIKE IT TO BE BETTER. SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF THIS IS WHAT WHAT KIND OF TARGETS ARE WE REALLY HOPING TO ACHIEVE. BUT THEN ADDITIONALLY D. AG RAISED WHEN HE WAS HERE THAT. PART OF THE WHEN YOU FILLED THE POSITIONS THAT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ENFORCEMENT. THAT THEY OFTEN IN. AS ANYONE WOULD IF THERE'S AN OPENING IN A POSITION THAT. GIVES THEM A A BETTER PAY OR A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION THAT THE MOVE ON AND THAT THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE ISSUES REGARDING THE VACANCIES [inaudible] NOW. THE B. C. P. DOES NOT INCLUDE RE CLASSIFICATION SO BUT THAT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE DIVISION ITSELF THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER IS THE PROBLEM. WITH. FEELING THE POSITIONS A CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM. SO BUT THAT'S ON YOU KNOW RATHER THAN US. DICTATING THAT THAT'S ON THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT AND COME BACK BUT THAT'S REALLY WHERE. AT LEAST I WAS COMING FROM IN TERMS OF TO TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NEW F. T. E.. WHEN WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EVEN MAINTAIN THE F. T. E. THAT WE HAVE GRANTED YOU? pTO ACHIEVING THE OUTCOME WE WANTED BUT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN. AND LOOK AT WHAT TWEAKS MAY BE NECESSARY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN JUST ON YOUR POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE LAST ISSUE REGARDING -- WITH THE BARGAINING ISSUE AND THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH CAL H. R. -- ON THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT IS ESTABLISHED SO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT OKAY GREAT BUT DID YOU IT YOU SEE MY POINT THOUGH THAT WHILE. WELL YOU ALL HAVE LIMITATIONS. IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT CLASSIFICATION LEVEL IS AND IT'S A BARGAINING. AND FIVE TOTALLY RESPECT THAT ARE ADDING NEW F. T. E. STILL DOESN'T SOLVE THAT. CORRECTED AYE ANDERSON WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS OPEN CIVIL FOR THE DISCUSSION BUT I THEIR NEW HAVE TV'S WERE TO ADDRESS THE NEW WORKLOAD THAT WAS -- SPELLED OUT AND SOME OF THE LEGISLATION YES YEAH I GUESS THAT WORK BUT IF THEY DON'T GET FILLED. WITH UNDERSTAFFED. I'M SURE I CAN ADD AS WELL OF THE A NUMBER OF VACANCIES WE HAVE HELD AND NOT BEENABLE TO FEEL RECENTLY BECAUSE THE INSOLVENCY OF THE BUDGET. IN OUR INTERNAL BUDGET WITH THE BUREAU FIREARMS. SO THIS THIS WHOLE PROCESS HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY HELPING TO RESOLVE AT THOUGH I THINK SOME OF THE PAST PERMANENT. FTP WAS NOT DISTRUST BUT WILL LOOK AT THE US CHECK US MY LOOK AT IT [inaudible] ART. HOLDING IT THANK YOU THANK YOU -- LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OF GO AHEAD CENTER MORE LIKE. FINISHERS THANK YOU I WAS GOING TO SEE IF THERE IS PUBLIC COMMENT YES. IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. YES SOME THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS COMMITTEE CAPULETS REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION FIRST OF ALL I THINK I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT DISCUSSION -- AND I DO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING I HAVEN'T SAID BEFORE WHICH IS I THINK THIS ATTORNEY GNERAL AND THIS VERY COMPETENT STAFF IS TRYING VERY HARD TO KIND OF CLEAN THIS WHOLE PROCESS UP AND DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG AND THEY'RE DEALING IN A TRANSPARENT WAY WHICH IS REFRESHING -- HAVING SAID THAT -- DOHAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH THE USE OF THE DRUGS ACCOUNT. FOR THE APP PROGRAM AGAIN THESE ARE FOLKS THAT AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. THE DEAL RECORD OF SALE IS A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ARE PURCHASING A FIREARM SO IT FEELS TO US LIKE THIS IS A GENERAL FUND. THERE'S ALSO LEGISLATION PENDING IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH MR BONTA TO INCREASE THE DROZ ON A LAW% ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ARE PURCHASING A FIREARM TIP TO PAY. FOR THE APP PROGRAM WE THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN UPSIDE DOWN. I DO AGREE WITH CENTER BELL THAT I THINK THERE'S A A BROADER CONVERSATION AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE. THAT THEY CAN'T JUST FIX BY. THE PROCESS THERE IN IT FEELS TO US LIKE THERE'S A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ISSUE THAT COULD MAYBE BE ADDRESSED AND PUBLIC POLICY AT SOME FUTURE DATE WHEN SOMEONE LOSES OUR FIREARMS RIGHTS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S AT THAT POINT THAT WE COULD MAKE A DENT. ON MAYBE THE BACKLOG NOT INCREASING -- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE WANT TO STAND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU AND WORK ON THIS BUT AGAIN WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF THE DRUGS ACCOUNT. THERE ARE LAWSUITS PENDING ON THIS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE APPS AND THEN I WILL OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ITEMS THAT WE DID IS VOTE ONLY. IF THERE'S ANY. ONE HERE WHO WANTED TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THOSE ITEMS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU OKAY. AND WE WILL GO TO OUR NEXT. ISSUE WHICH IS OKAY SO WE'LL NOW GO TO ISSUE.

THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS CHUCK SUPPLE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND IT'S A PLEASURE AND HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY -- TO TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MOVE THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. FEEL THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP ON THE JOURNEY OF STRENGTHENING DJS ABILITY TO FULFILL OUR VISION AND MISSION. AND UTILIZING SOME NEW KEY STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY -- THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY THAT VISION JUVENILE JUSTICE HAS BEEN -- ON A JOURNEY FOR QUITE SOME TIME WITH REGARD TO BOTH HOME AND SERVES AS WELL AS OUR APPROACH TO SERVING THAT POPULATION BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- AT ITS HEIGHT -- SOME THIRTEEN THOUSAND YOUTH WERE IN EIGHT FACILITIES AND FIVE FIRE CAMPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- TODAY THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY -- SEVEN HUNDRED YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS IN THREE FACILITIES AND ONE FIRE CAMP -- AND THAT WAS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS BOTH IN TERMS OF A DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AND JUVENILE -- JUVENILES INVOLVED IN -- THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM JUVENILE ARRESTS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF POLICY CHANGES OVER THE YEARS -- THAT HAVE DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF YOUTH COMING TO DJJ AND REALIGNED THE POPULATION THAT DOES COME TO DJJ. AND ALONG THE LINES ALL ALONG THAT JOURNEY OF COURSE WAS THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT WHERE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE INVESTED -- IN IMPROVING - THESERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE -- IN PRACTICALLY ALL QUARTERS -- OF THE DIVISION FROM EDUCATION -- TO THE SAFETY AND WELFARE -- MENTAL HEALTH -- AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS. AND WHERE WE ARE AT NOW -- 201-6 HAVING -- BEEN RELEASED FROM THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT -- IT THE JOURNEY IS NOT OVER IN TERMS OF IMPROVING AND REFORMING -- THE DIVISION TO BEST SERVE THE POPULATION -- WHO WE ARE? SET UP TO SERVE -- WHAT IS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT WE NOW HAVE OBVIOUSLY A MUCH MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE YOUTH WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- HOWEVER THAT POPULATION REPRESENTS PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUSLY BEHAVIOR LEE AND MENTALLY CHALLENGED USE THAT WE ARE ENTRUSTED WITH. AND MOVING FORWARD -- I SIXTY THREE IS A AREAS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AS WELL AS THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE FIRST IS TO SUSTAIN IN ADVANCE THE GAME THE SISTINE AND ADVANCE THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT. IN IN PARTICULAR -- THIS IS IN THE AREA THE INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR TREATMENT MODEL WE NOW HAVE THE MEANS TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS -- THE RISKS AND UNDERLYING FOR MANAGING NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME TO US WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE -- TO PROVIDE THEM WITH EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THAT RISK TARGETED SPECIFICALLY -- TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS THE REASONS THAT THEY CAME TO THE DJ DAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT. NEEDS BEHIND THEIR DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR THAT BROUGHT THEM TO DJJ. AND THE MEANS TO BE ABLE -- TO PROVIDE THE PROPER CASE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS A BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO REINFORCE THE POSITIVE BEHAVIORS AND SANCTIONS THANKS IN THE THE NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN AN ADVANCE THOSE GAMES CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE FIDELITY IN THE QUALITY THE DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES BUT WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE YOUTH REDUCE THE REST THAT THEY CAME TO DJJ. FOUR AND SECONDLY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CONSULT CULTIVATE A CULTURE A CULTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE MISSION -- I REFER TO THIS REALLY A A CULTURE OF SUCCESS AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THIS IS CHERYL IS ACHIEVED THROUGH A A LAWSUIT BUT IT'S REALLY AN ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON CONTINUALLY TO BE ONE THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF A YOUTH SUCCESS AND AND WHOLLY EMBRACES THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIRD IS TO BUILD UP THE STRENGTH BASS BASS AS I CALL IT. WE IN THE EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED TO HELP YOU TO BE ABLE TO LEARN IN A SENSE HOW NOT TO FIGHT. BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO THAT IN HELPING TO USE RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE TO GIVE THAT YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN A REASON WHY NOT TO FIGHT AND EMOTIONAL. MOTIVATION AS TO WHY THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE TOOLS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT A LARGE PART OF THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO BUILD ON THEIR STRENGTHS -- VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING -- COMMUNITY -- PROGRAMS COMING IN -- MENTORS COMING IN TO BE ABLE TO MOTIVATE INSPIRE AND AND SUPPORT THEM -- IN PURSUING IT INITIALLY AND MATCHING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIFFERENT IDENTITY THAN THE ONES THAT THEY BELIEVED IN THEMSELVES WALKING IN. AND TO BE ABLE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO NOT JUST THINK ABOUT THE LIFE THAT THEY WANT TO BEGIN LIVING WHEN THEY LEAVE BUT TO BEGIN LIVING THAT WHILE THEY ARE WITH US AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE -- HAVE ASPIRATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS THE CONTINUE ON INTO THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TOLIVE THAT LIFE WHEN THEY LEAVE -- IT WHEN THEY LEAVE DJJ AND WE WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY -- THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN DJS DAY'S JOURNEY OF REFORM AND GROWTH -- THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL TO MOVE US OUT OF THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY IS RIGHT ON TRACK AND A MILESTONE THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL. THOSE THREE TARGETS THAT I JUST REFERRED TO AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS AND MORE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THE MANAGER CENTERS -- ALSO SAID THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE EXCITED AT THE AGENCY TO WELCOME CHUCK AND HIS TEAM -- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT FIT TO HELP THEM IMPROVE ON THE PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE THROUGH THE FOR A LAWSUIT AND HE TO BUILD THAT THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATED MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT THE NEW DEPARTMENT -- YOU KNOW OUR AGENCY IS FOCUSED ON THE PERSON IT'S FOCUSED ON REINTEGRATION AND THAT'S FOR THE DEPARTMENT JUVENILE JUSTICE IS HEADING IN THE DEPARTMENT. SO WITH THAT WE THINK WERE A YOU CAN DECISION SUPPORT THEM IN THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING FOSTER THAT CULTURE CHANGE AS WELL AS HELPING TO CONNECT THEM TO LOCALS. IN CITY IN OUR DIVERSE DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH INTEGRATION THANK YOU. AND WE DID NOT BRING THE CHOIR BUT IT WAS. I KNOW THAT ARE AT LEAST HAVE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC COMMENT AND CERTAINLY ON MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE. BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE LA -- FIRST AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF THE PART IN FINANCE WANTS TO ADD. MORNING LUCAS MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN CONCERT IN THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A FEW QUESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS WHETHER DJ NEEDS TO BE REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION. WILL NOTE THAT THE MOST RECENT DATA ON RECIDIVISM COMES FROM THE COURT THAT WAS RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE FELLOW LAWSUIT DID NOT END UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND AS A RESULT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE DJ IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING AT REHABILITATING YOUTH -- OUR NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED. MULTIPLE OUTCOMES AND TARGET TO THEY WOULD HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS REORGANIZATION HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR OR HOW THIS WE ORGANIZATION WOULD ACCOMPLISH THESE. OUTCOMES OR WHY THEY CANNOT BE PERFORMED WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE UNDERSEA DC ARE. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE REORGANIZATION. WITHOUT UNDER KNOWING HOW THEY'LL OPERATIONALIZE THESE. THIS REORGANIZATION AND HOW THEY WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE OUTCOMES IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IT WOULD IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH. THEY COULD ALSO INCREASED COSTS -- PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SOME SERVICES A COMPANY SHARED BETWEEN D. J. J. M. C. C. R. THESE ARE POTENTIALLY TO BE DUPLICATED ON THE REALIZATION. IN ADDITION THERE COULD BE OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS COMPLICATING. COORDINATION BETWEEN THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND CDC ARE. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS ALL THE ALTERNATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES THAT COULD BE -- LOOKED AT WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER STATES HAVE ORGANIZED OF JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT WHILE MANY SIX TO HAVE THEIR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE ABOUT HALF THE STATE TO THAT STRUCTURE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT MODEL TO A DIFFERENT MODEL -- MOST COMMONLY AUTO TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT THAT'S NOT UNDER AN AGENCY OR PUT IT INTO AN AGENCY THAT SPECIFICALLY. FOR FOCUSED ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO FULLY WE ALIGN. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO COUNTIES CURRENTLY ABOUT 30% OF INCARCERATED YOUTH ARE HELD IN DJJ WITH THE REMAINDER AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND BOTH COUNTY FACILITIES AND STATE FACILITIES ARE AT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL CAPACITY. SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE SENSE FROM A PHYSICAL STANDPOINT TO REORGANIZE THE WE LINE TO THE GYM -- COUNTIES AND ALSO IT COULD POTENTIALLY BRING THOSE HE'S CLOSER TO THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE SUCH AS FAMILIES. ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO KEEP DJ WITH N. C. C. R. AND FOCUS ON ELIMINATING ANY BARRIERS IF THEY ARE IDENTIFIED TO REHABILITATION WITHIN CDC ARE FACED WITH POTENTIALLY ALSO HAVE A BENEFIT TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. WHICH HOUSES A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN PRISON AND ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON FOR COMPETITIVE AT ABOUT 700-100-0700 PEOPLE IN. THE DJJ [inaudible] FINALLY WE ASKED WHETHER THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION. THE WE KNOW THAT THE PREVIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE GONE TO AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH REALIZATION PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE. SINCE THE TIME OF THIS ANALYSIS DJ HAS PUT FORWARD A TRAILER BILL AND WE HAVE ALSO SENT QUESTIONS THE MINISTRATION TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE CHANGES. NOTABLY WHAT PERSONAL ADJUSTMENTS IN RESOURCES WILL BE NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE TRAILER BILL. WHAT A NEW TRAINING PROGRAM THAT INCLUDING THE LANGUAGE WOULDN'T TAIL AND WHETHER TO APPLY TO ALL PERSONNEL OR JUST NEW PERSONAL -- WHY THE TRAILER BILL NEEDS LANGUAGE TO ACCEPT THE NEW DEPARTMENT FROM THE REGULATORY PROCESS SEES? AS WELL AS A NEW PROGRAM. TWO WAY THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] BERMAN FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ERIN ANDREWS WITH PART IN FINANCE -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE ARE STRONG. SKILL. THAT ALLERGIES. WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER SUPPLE -- AND HIS VISION FOR WHERE THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE HEADING -- I ALSO AGREE WITH COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER COUNT THAT THE HHSAA IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR US FOR DJ TO BE LOCATED. IN ORDER -- TO CONTINUE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AND REHABILITATION -- AND BEYOND THAT I THINK THE THE THEY HAVE WELL SUMMARIZE THE THE REASONS WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IN SEPARATE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE [inaudible] CERTAINLY -- THANK YOU. SO. FIVE NINE AM I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A COUPLE COMMENTS. MY FIRST COMMENT IS. I APPRECIATE THE LA OWES RAISING THOSE ISSUES -- BECAUSE IT IS COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE FOR US. TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THIS MOVE [inaudible] WILL [inaudible] IMPROVE REHABILITATION. BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THAT'S OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND IF WE LOOK. MEAN SOME SOME OF THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE OBVIOUSLY OVERTIME WERE DUE TO LAWSUITS BUT IF WE LOOK AT OUR TRAJECTORY AND HOW WE ARE DEALING WITH ALL OF OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION WHETHER YOUTH OR ADULTS [inaudible] WE HAVE. OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME BEEN MOVING MUCH MORE TOWARDS. WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST ACCEPTING THAT THE PEOPLE WE HOLD WILL RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE. WHAT DO WE DO WHILE THEY ARE IN OUR -- WELL AT THE POINT THAT DURING THE TIME. THAT WE HOLD HIM IN CUSTODY. WHAT IS OUR ROLE TO HELP INSURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE RETURNED HOME? THAT WE HAVE MAXIMIZED THE OBJECTIVE OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND I THINK THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE OVER TIME HAS COME TO EMBRACE THAT [inaudible] THAT. THAT IN THE PAST. DEAR THE WHAT I MIGHT CALL THE MORE PUNITIVE MODEL WELL CERTAINLY INCARCERATION WILL REMAIN TO BE SOME LEVEL OF AT BEING PUNITIVE BECAUSE IT IS. WITHDRAWING SOMEONE'S FREEDOM. BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A RECOGNITION THAT. IF WE ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE RETURNING TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE IS A STATE IS PUBLIC SAFETY THEN WE THAT PUNISHMENT ALONE WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE TO ASSURE PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT WE HAVE. TO UTILIZE THE TIME THAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE IN CUSTODY IN A WAY TO EQUIP THEM. TO AND MAKE AND HELP US FEEL ASSURED THAT WHEN THEY RETURN THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IS BEING -- INSURED ALSO. SO IN WE KNOW THAT. JUVENILES ARE VERY UNIQUE POPULATION AND OF COURSE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ESPECIALES. NINETY SIX SEVEN THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT IS SHOWN THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY WELL WE ALWAYS HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF JUVENILES TO EXHIBIT THE SAME JUDGMENT AS ADULTS. I THINK WE MAY NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD SO FULLY HOW MUCH THEY REALLY ARE NOT ADULTS THAT REALLY THESE A WHOLE LOT OF CAPACITIES. FOR DECISIONS FOR RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR AND SUCH ARE REALLY NOT DEVELOPED. UNTIL A AN AGE PASSED ADOLESCENCE. SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS COME INTO PLAY IN THIS NOW. I AM GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MOVE. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS A CULTURE CHANGE [inaudible] AND BY. WITH THIS UNIQUE POPULATION OF JUVENILES [inaudible] IF WE CONTINUE WITHIN A CULTURE OF A MORE PUNITIVE CULTURE THAT ARE CDC ARE IS IT. YOU KNOW WHILE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF SOME TRANSITION IS STILL ESSENTIALLY THAT'S ITS FOCUS. THAT TE AGENCY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT LEAST COMMUNICATE THAT WITH THIS POPULATION WE ARE REALLY MOVING TO AN AGENCY. ACHIEVE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE AT LEAST FOR SOME OF US THOSE OF US WHO ARE. ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A AGENCY CHANGE AND THAT IN FACT WE ARE PREPARED AND EQUIPPED. TO DO THE TYPE OF CULTURE CHANGE SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE HE OUTCOMES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED. BUT MY QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS MARKERS ARE WE UTILIZING TO GUIDE THISTRANSITION. AND ARE THERE STATES THAT WE MIGHT LOOK TO AS MODELS THAT YOU YOU MAY BE LOOKING AT AS A MODEL. IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT WHICHEVER VIEW. SURE I THINK THAT. REALLY WITHIN BOTH THE JUVENILE AS WELL AS ADULTS SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THERE ARE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT AND ARE PULLING FROM. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH REGARD TO THE THE CULTURE PIECE IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THERE'S ACTUALLY SPECIFIC. LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO MISSION -- AND THE MISSION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION IS THE YOUTH. WHO HAVE HURT PEOPLE? AND HAD BEEN HURT THEMSELVES. RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY AND BECOME RESPONSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL ADULTS. I THINK THAT SPEAKS ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS IN TERMS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WE'VE PULLED FROM. OTHER MODELS AS WELL AS OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD HERE ONE JUST. RIGHT OFF THE BAT SAYING THAT THE YOUTH WHO COME TO US. ALL OF THEM HAVE HURT SOMEBODY. AND THAT'S THE REASON IS THAT THEY ARE [inaudible] WITH US. AND THAT THERE'S A VICTIM ASSOCIATED WITH EVERYBODY WHO IS COMING [inaudible] TO DJJ. AND ALONG WITH THAT THE WE NEED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THAT IS OUR ROLE REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THIS YOUNG PERSON HIS HURT SOMEBODY OUR ROLE IS TO HELP THEM. IT'S NOT TO SEEK RETRIBUTION PUNISHMENT. BUT IT IS TO HELP THEM AND THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE. FOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT EVERYBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS TO EXCEPT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THAT MISSION. AND THAT THEY FOR THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE BEEN HURT THEMSELVES AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE TRAUMAIS SPEAKS TO THIS LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPERIENCES. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT CONTRIBUTED AND PLAYED A ROLE AND WE'RE A PART OF ALTERNATELY THEM COMING TO DJJ. IN THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER THE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THE SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. MANY OF THOSE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES THE CONTRIBUTED ALL THE WAY TO THE BEHAVIORS THAT BROUGHT THEM TO DJJ. AND THEN TO RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY. PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IN DJJ. IS GOING TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY EITHER THE DATE AGES TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FIVE AND THAT OUR JOB EVERY INTERACTION EVERY SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT YOU HE'S GOT TO BE GEARED TOWARDS HELPING THEM TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE. AND THAT YOU ARE NOT YEAH WE ARE NOT BEING GENUINE IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL MISSION. OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IF WE ARE NOT DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO HELP THANK YOUNG PERSON CHANGE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE RETURNING TO THE COMMUNITY AND POSSIBLY LIVING. YOU KNOW IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE WANT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT POSITIVELY OF THAT YOUNG PERSON UPON THEIR RETURN. END. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO NO HARM -- THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND BECOME RESPONSIBLE SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE VISION STATEMENT THAT'S IN THERE WE WANT TO SEE THEM IS THRIVING AND ENGAGE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S PART OF THE COMMUNITY RESTORATION PIECE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH -- THE NAME CHANGE AS WELL. AND SO TO BE ABLE TO GET A FULFILL THAT MISSION THERE'S SEVERAL STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE PULLED FROM -- BOTH OUR OWN EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AND AND EVEN INTERNATIONALLY FUNDAMENTALLY WE NEED TO BUILD STRONG SAFE AND CARING COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AND THAT WE NEED TO GET ENGAGED ALL MEMBERS INCLUDING THE STAFF USE FAMILIES VOLUNTEERS VISITORS IN FULFILLING THIS MISSION. THE IDEA IS KIND OF BORROWED FROM NORWAY KIND OF BORROWED FROM GERMANY THE IDEA OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NORMALCY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REMOVE SOMEBODY FROM SOCIETY BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM TO BE IN SOCIETY YOU NEED TO CREATE. WITHIN YOUR INCARCERATED SETTING. A A NORMAL SOCIETY FOR THEM TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE SAFELY WITHIN SOCIETY AND SO WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DO IS TO BUILD SAY STRONG CARING COMMUNITIES WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. THAT A YOUNG PERSON CAN LEARN HOW TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE SAFELY WITHIN A COMMUNITY THOSE ARE THE SKILLS THEY'RE GONNA NEED WHEN THEY RETURN. TO COMMUNITY BEYOND OUR WALLS AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF THE STAFF'S JOB BE THE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING TO CHANGE THIS YOUNG PERSON THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE A COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND WE SEE THAT COMMUNITY IN DJJ. AS BEING THE STAFF EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER YOUTH THE FAMILIES THE VOLUNTEERS AND THE VISITORS AND IN THE FUTURE VISITORS COMING TO US. TO OUR FACILITIES WE WANT TO SEEAND HOLD UP THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE ENGAGED IN HELPING US FULFILL THAT MISSION I KNOW SENATOR BILL WHEN YOU WERE OUT YOU ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ASKING ABOUT HOW YOU COULD HELP -- TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF INVOLVEMENT THAT WE WANT EVERYBODY TO HELP SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WITH REGARD TO THE YOUTH IN DJJ ENSURE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOR FILLING THAT MISSION. THE SECOND PART OF THE STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP A FULLY PREPARED AND CONTINUALLY SUPPORT STAFF THAT. IS HEALTHY EDUCATED AND TRAINED TO FULFILL THEIR THEIR UNIQUE ROLE IN FOR THEIR UNIQUE AND VITAL ROLES TO FULFIL FAT. THAT MISSION AND A BIG PART OF THIS TRANSITION IN AN INITIAL -- ACTIVITY OF THAT IS TO BUILD A TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TRAIN BOTH ARE INCOMING STAFF AS WELL AS ON ONGOING BASIS STAFF. VOLUNTEERS FAMILIES ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE YOUTH AND HOW TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES IN THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE THERE ARE SO THAT EVERYBODY IS PART OF THAT MISSION FORCE SO TO SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THAT MISSION. AND WE WANT TO OFFER TREATMENT TO HELP YOU FEEL FROM PAST EXPERIENCES AND CHANGE THEIR THINKING BELIEVES. THELEAD TO HURTING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WE HAVE AS I MENTIONED AS A RESULT OF FERAL -- A NUMBER OF INTERVENTIONS THEIR EVIDENCE BASED TO HELP USE BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR THINKING SOCIAL COGNITIVE -- INTERVENTIONS -- AS WELL AS THE INTERVENTIONS RELATED TO ADDRESSING UP PAST TRAUMAS AND WE WANT TO BUILD UP ON THAT AS WELL. AND ALSO TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND RESTORE THE HARMS THAT THE THAT THEIR ACTIONS COST AND THAT'S PART OF THE DEVELOPING THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES WITHIN DJ JACK. PART OF THE SKILLS YOU LEARN IS THE BEHAVIORS THAT BROKE ROCKETED DJJ AS WELL AS ONGOING BEHAVIORS IN THE IN THE FACILITY. THAT IS NOT A MATTER OF JUST YOU KNOW GETTING CAUGHT AND TAKING A SANCTION IT'S UNDERSTANDING THE HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PRE BEHAVIORS HOW TO REPAIR THE HARM TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A SKILL THAT YOU WANT THEM TO CARRY WITH THEM BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY LEARN HOW TO BE ACTIVE ENGAGE MEMBERS AND TO UNDERSTAND ACTIONS THAT CREATE HARMON HOW TO REPAIR THE SOMETHING WE ALL NEED TO THINK ABOUT. ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS AS RESPONSIBLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THEN TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TRAINING AND LIFE XPERIENCES FOR YOU TO IMAGINE A SPIRE AND BUILD A PATHWAY TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE. I KNOW BIRD SINGER SAID IN IN HER HER BOOK BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE THAT. YOU KNOW A FUNDAMENTAL NEED A YOUNG PERSON IS FOR ATTACHMENT AN ASPIRATION AND WE NEED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH IN DJJ TO THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO DO A NEW FUTURE RIENTATION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM LIKE A COATING PROGRAM AND WHAT HAVE YOU. TO NOT JUST THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO WHAT I GET OUT BUT THEY START DOING IT AND PRACTICING WEARING THAT NEW SET OF CLOTHES WHILE THEY ARE WITH US. AND FINALLY WE WANT BRING PEOPLE WITH RESOURCES RELATIONSHIPS EXPERTISE AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE LIVED EXPERIENCE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. THE CAN INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE YOUTH AND TO BUILD A CARING COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR RE ENTRY AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE. IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH -- PROBATION AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANY OF A PROBATION DEPARTMENTS PARTNER WITH. AND IDENTIFY NEW PARTNERS BRING THEM IN EARLY CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO TO TO LEARN HOW TO CODE TO PARTICIPATE IN A LOW IN A IN A CONSERVATION CORPS WHILE THEY'RE WITH US INTO HAVE THAT TRANSITION DIRECTLY INTO OPPORTUNITY SEAMLESSLY IN THE COMMUNITY. OTHER WORDS THERE START TO LIVE THEIR IFE WITH US IN THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IN PLACE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO LIVE THAT LIFE WHEN THE RE RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. AND ALSO CREDIBLE MESSENGER MENTORING IS A BIG PART OF IT AS WELL NO BETTER INDIVIDUALS TO COME INTO OUR FACILITIES INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE OUR YOUTH IN INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES WHO HAVE BEEN -- IN THEIR SHOES HAVE SAT IN THEIR SEATS AND BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT IT IS WE'RE ASKING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO. AN INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES WHO AND I SAID HAVE BEEN -- HAVE HAVE LIVED X. SUCH EXPERIENCES AND THE AMERICORPS PROGRAM THAT WAS PART OF THE BUDGET AS WELL -- TO ESTABLISH -- CADRE IF YOU WILL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN -- A PART OF THE SYSTEM MY BROTHER IN JUVENILE SIDE OR ON THE ADULT SIDE HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE BOTH FIVE THROUGH THE FACILITY AS WELL AS MOST IMPORTANTLY WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. HOW TO BE ABLE TO LINK TO RESOURCES HOW TO BE ABLE TO HIT THOSE CRITICAL MARKERS LIKE -- AND PROGRESS EMPLOYMENT pADULTS IN THEIR LIFE BEING ABLE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR FAMILY BEAN ENGAGE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO THEN APPLY FOR AND ACHIEVE AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE THESE ARE ALL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM OTHER -- EXAMPLES -- BOTH -- IN THE IN OTHER STATES AND AND INTERNATIONALLY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO INCORPORATE INTO THIS MODEL THAT WE'RE GONNA BETTER BE ABLE TO FULFILL THAT THAT MISSION AND ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES OF HELPING YOU THREE TURN. BECOME RESPONSIBLE ENGAGE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY UPON THEIR RETURN. THANK YOU. THE I APPRECIATE THE THAT MORE -- DETAILED EXPLANATION OF SOME OF THE SPECIFICS THAT -- SOME OF THE COMPONENTS THE TRAILER BILL SOME OF THE SPECIFICS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND AND THEN THE REITERATION OF THE OBJECTIVES AND HOW THEY'RE CONNECTED TO DIFFERENT ITEMS OF THE TRAILER BILL. NOW I NOTE THAT THE TRAILER BILL. THAT IF WE MOVE ON THIS THIS IS A A BIG THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT'S COMPLICATED. BUT I WONDER -- WHEN I LOOK AT THE TRAILER BILL? WHILE BUDGET ACTIONS GOING TO PLACE IN GENERAL ON JULY ONE OF NINETEEN THINGS LIKE THE NAME CHANGE IN THIS CASE YOU DON'T PROPOSED UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER. WELL SO FIRST I WAS THINKING. IF WE PROCEED WITH THIS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IS THIS CULTURE CHANGE IT SEEMS TO ME WE'D WANT TO WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE NAME RIGHT AWAY WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE THE NAME CHANGE GOING TO AFFECT. ON JULY. ONE THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. GIVEN OUT WERE -- EVEN MORE DIVERSE PART OF THE TRAILER BILL AS YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP TRAINING. FOR THE EXISTING STAFF AND CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE -- MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE GOING TO BE CREATING A TRAINING COMPONENT AND AND THE STAFF HAVE TO BE TRAINED TO THIS NEW MISSION AND OBJECTIVE IN SUCH. SEOUL THE OTHER SIDE TO DATE CHANGE. WHAT -- MECHANISMS DO YOU HAVE THAT WILL HELP US ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY GIVEN THE PACE OF THIS TRANSITION. AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED. A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP SAY OF OF EXPERTS IN. IN THIS NEW MISSION DAY THAT WE ARE IF WE ADOPT DISEMBARKING ON I KNOW THAT THE SECRETARY VALLEY AS WELL AS MYSELF -- ARE VERY MUCH COMMITTED -- TO ONGOING COMMUNICATION WITH AN INVOLVEMENT OF CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS EXPERT TO THE LIKE -- IN THIS PROCESS -- AND ABSOLUTELY WOULD BE SEEKING THEIR ADVICE YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT -- THIS INITIAL STAGE WHICH IS -- SOME OF ITS BIG WITH REGARD TO THE TRAINING -- IT PIECE OF IT AS WELL A LOT OF IT IS. RATHER MUNDANE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO ALL THE SIGNIFICANT TASK OF JUST THE MOVING IT FROM CDC ARE AND PUTTING AND ESTABLISHING THE SYSTEMS OVER IN -- INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. IN OBVIOUSLY OPEN TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- YOU KNOW REGULARLY INFORMED. THE GOOD CRITICAL STATE COLORS OBVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF OF THE PROGRESS AS WE MOVE ALONG SO. BUT AND YOU HAVE AN ANTICIPATED A FORMAL. SOME OTHER WORDS THAT'S AN INFORMAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. WHAT ABOUT THE NAME CHANGE -- WELL WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO ACT AS IF UNTIL OFFICIALLY -- IT IS AN HADN'T ACTUALLY I THINK CONTEMPLATED THE TIMING O THE THE NAME CHANGED BEYOND JUST SORT OF THE THE TRAJECTORY OF OF WHEN IT COULD HAPPEN BUT IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD CONSIDER OKAY. I I HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE ON BRING A BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE IT AND AND ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THEY'RE MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I I'M NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE SOUGHT ALLOW ME TO HAVE SOME VERY. BASIC QUESTIONS BUT THE FIRST VISIT IN IN OUR MATERIAL WE DON'T REALLY HAVE. AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OR A VISION STATEMENT -- SO FOR ME IS THAT SOMEONE CAN A NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE IT WILL BE NICE TO SAY WE ARE. MAKING THE FOLLOWING. RE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES. TO BENEFIT FROM THE FOLLOWING EFFICIENCIES ARE PROGRAM CHANGES. AND YOU KNOW LIKE A LIKE A SEVENTY FIVE WORDS. ADDING CAPS LATER EVERYTHING YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WHERE WOULD I FIND THAT WERE COULD YOU GIVE IT TO ME AND SEVENTY FIVE WORDS OR LESS WELL I THINK THAT THE I MEAN ALL WE WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO REDUCE THE RISKS AND THE UNDERLYING WHAT THEY CALL COMMITTEE JETTING NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH? A YOUNG PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR DAYS BEHAVIOR THAT BROUGHT THEM TO DJJ AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BUILD UP UPON THEIR STRENGTHS -- BUILD UP ON THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THOSE REST ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE LOWERED REST WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT ALL THE ONLY WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE GOING -- TO BECOME OBVIOUSLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM THAT THEY'RE GONNA DESIST FROM THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR BUT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAD POSITIVE OUTCOMES RELATED. TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THE LIKE BUT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING THAT. CERTAINLY THAT'S WHAT WERE ABSOLUTELY WORKING TOWARD DOING IT DOWN SO HEALTHY HOWEVER THE A NUMBER OF THOSE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH IN TERMS OF REDUCING THOSE RISKS THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES -- AND THE LIKE THE THE THE EXPERTISE OF THE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE LIKE. THAT -- THAT THAT IS THEIR DOMAIN SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW THEIR EXPERTISE ARE SITUATED WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND SO BY BEING A PART OF THAT DEPARTMENT WE WILL BE CLOSER TO WORKING FAR MORE COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE VERY AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE POPULATION. THAT WE READ THAT WE RECEIVE AND AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVING IN ADDITION WITH REGARD TO THE TRANSITION A NUMBER OF THOSE SERVICES -- SUPPORTS AND AND RESOURCES AND THE LIKE ARE ALSO SITUATED WITHIN THAT APARTMENT IN BEING ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM EARLIER ON TO BE ABLE TO PLAN FOR THAT TRANSITION SO THAT THAT SUPPORT WILL BE OUT THERE WHEN THE RETURN. IS ANOTHER CRITICAL. TWENTY WORDS SORRY. YOU A FACTUAL SOONER WE CAN SEND YOU A NEW. ONE IT JUST YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE JUST LIKE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SAY THIS IS WHY. THESE ARE THE OUTCOMES WERE EXPECTING IT'S GONNA BE BETTER CHEAPER WHAT YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS SO THAT WE CAN. KIND OF JUST MAKE IT REAL SIMPLE. TO I UNDERSTAND AND I APOLOGIZE IF I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT IT DID IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE A PART OF THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM. THAT THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE END OF THE LINE THE LAST STOP IN A YOUNG PERSON'S. JOURNEY THROUGH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT THE NEXT STOP IS NOT A PRISON CELL THE NEXT STOP IS. A NEW A NEW LIFE AND IN THE COMMUNITY BECOMING A THRIVING ENGAGE MEMBER OF THAT. AND THEN -- YEAH I GUESS THAT IT DID BECAUSE I'M I'M LOOKING FOR OUTCOMES RESULTS WHAT DO I MANAGE WHAT WHAT MEASURE. AND THEN. IS IT JUST A MERGER YOU KNOW SIDE. OUR TOP RESHAPE. THE ANSWERS. HI I JUST NEED. TO BECOME A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT A LITTLE MORE SALT I'LL KEEP THIS THING SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UNDER BILL -- NO I AGREE WITH -- MOSIS QUESTIONS BEEN GOOD AND THIS IS IMPORTANT OF KIND OF MOVIE YOU FROM A CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. TO A HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM. TO ALLOW FOR THE REHABILITATION. TREATMENT. THAT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE USER AND YOUNG ADULTS -- HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE KEY CONCERNS. THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE ANSWERS WE HAVE SOME UNKNOWNS HERE -- IN A GIVEN THE SHIFT OF THE DEPARTMENT. I IMAGINE THEY'LL BE CHANGED SERVICES AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE CHANGER. OF HOW WE DO THINGS -- SO THAT BEING SAID -- DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE A FIVE YOU'RE KIND OF A STEP BY STEP WHAT HE WANTS TO DO ON THIS OR IS HAVE A VISION OF HOW WE HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THIS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WELL I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE TASK BEFORE ME YOUR PRESENTED TO ME IN THIS PROPOSAL -- TO TO TO MOVE IT -- BUT I THINK THAT THE TRANSITIONING. I THINK THE VISION IS BETTER I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE THE THE OVERALL YOU KNOW REFOCUSING OF IT AND DOUBLING DOWN ON YOU KNOW A DELIVERY OF SERVICES IN THE LIGHT. IS IT YOU KNOW. IT IS IT IS CERTAINLY A HANDFUL HERE AND I THINK IT IS SPEAKS DIVISION FOR THE STATE AS WELL. AND SO -- OTHER STATES HAVE GONE -- TO DIFFERENT MODELS LIKE THE MISSOURI MODEL HERE FROM OUR SO OF WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE -- THE FOR FOR FOR FACILITIES CENTRAL -- TO THEIR TOGETHER -- THEY'RE DESIGNED TO HOLD MUCH LARGER POPULATIONS AND WE HAVE NOW. WITH SO I'M KIND OF GOING OVER THIS. IF YOU HAD THE RIGHT IF YOU HAD TO SET UP A MODEL. THERE WAS APPROPRIATE TO BE OPERATED BY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WHEN SHE TO LOOK AT -- SMALLER FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE AREAS WERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE -- THAT COULD FOCUS ON LIKE A HEALTH CARE -- THERAPEUTIC MENTAL HEALTH -- AS WELL AS THE RELIGION. VALUATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU HAVE MORE FACILITIES WOULD YOU BE ABLE -- TO LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE. THESE FACILITIES AND AS THE POPULATION GETS SMALLER YOUR SERVICE OF MIXING TYPES OF YOUNG-PEOPLE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROBLEMS OKAY. THERE ARE TIMES OF OFFENDERS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF YOUNG PEOPLE OKAY I PUT THAT WAY -- IF YOU HAD MORE FACILITIES YOU WOULD HAVE MORE ABILITY. TO MAYBE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE MORE SPECIALIZED IN EACH FACILITY MAYBE OF SOLELY THIS DESIGN FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND OF PROGRAMS ARE CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE -- ARE YOU LOOKING AT CLOSING DOWN OUR FACILITIES EVENTUALLY. A MOVING OUT OF THOSE FACILITIES AND CREATING NEW FACILITIES THAT -- OR IN A MORE A MYSTERY MODEL KIND OF APPROACH. OR ARE YOU LOOKING TO JUST KEEP IN THE SAME ALL FACILITIES THE WAY THEY ARE JUST HAVING. A DIFFERENT APARTMENT. OPERATED. SO WITH SO. I THINK I THINK THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION TO ME IS KIND OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. HE'S GOING TO KEEP THE SAME. BUILDINGS FACILITIES BEFORE. HAVE ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IS. SIX SIX SEVEN HUNDRED OF THEM. IN FOR FACILITIES IN FACILITIES THAT ARE. GOING TO BE LIKE -- THIRD -- 25% OCCUPIED IMPORTANCE WITH THE THE OCCUPANCY OF ROOM YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR TWENTY IT IS THEY CAN HOLD A LOT OF LOT MORE. PEOPLE IF YOU WANTED -- TO AND THEN IF YOU WENT TO A DIFFERENT LOOK. KIND OF MODEL WHETHER SMALLER. FACILITY SHE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF STAFF YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE HEALTH HEALTH THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY MIGHT HAVE. A STAFF DOES SO MAYBE -- MORE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TYPE PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH -- SOCIAL WORKERS. STE A PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKERS SO. SMALLER BET NUMBER BEDS IN EACH UNIT -- IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY STAFF SO. ARE YOU LOOKING AT A MODEL LIKE I'M TALKING ABOUT OR YOU LOOK INTO A MODEL THAT JUST KEEPS THE FACILITIES LIKE THEY ARE. SEEMS TO BE THE WHICH WATER WOULD PRESUME PRODUCE. THE BEST RESULTS IS THE ONE WE WANT TO GO WITH RIDE. AND AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION ON ON FUNDING. YOU'RE OUT OF WHERE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- WE WENT TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE SERVICES THERE WERE. HEALTH. WITH. THESE SERVICES BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL MEDICAID OF EPS D. T. OTHER KINDS OF HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. THE YOUR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T GET RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. IS THAT IS THAT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BE SOMETHING THE STAFF COULD GIVE US AN ANSWER ON YOU KNOW -- AND IF IF SO. WHEN YOU DO YOUR -- CRIMINAL ANGELIC VALUATIONS. COULD THAT BE COMBINED WITH A HEALTH EVALUATION LIKE -- THE PST TO THE WHICH YOU KNOW OF A TALKING ABOUT IT -- WHERE EVERY OF YOUNG PERSON IS EVALUATED FROM THE HEALTH STANDPOINT? DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MENTAL HEALTH. OVERALL HEALTH CARE LIKE WHAT'S THERE [inaudible] CURRENT. CURRENT STATUS -- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN WHAT THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS OR DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY -- PEOPLE IN THE OF YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL. DISABILITIES THAT. MAKE THEM UNDER THE AMERICANS FOR DISABILITIES ACT ELIGIBLE. FOR THE SERVICES -- FUNDED OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DISABLED PERSON. IN HPESSSRI ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE. OF IS THAT. WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS OF? COULD YOU MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE I'M I'M LOOKING. FOR TO GET INTO BETTER CLEARER PICTURE. OF WHAT YOUR APPROACH IS GOING TO BE WHAT. ALL ALSO OFFER A QUICK AND TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING I DON'T THINK IT WOULD CHANGE THE SEVEN WILL DIFFER LOOK INTO AND RESEARCH TO SEE IF WE CAN GET MORE FEDERAL FUNDING WE ALWAYS ON MAXIMIZE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING. THE MOST WE CAN -- OR NOT IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY A MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF YOU'RE NOT IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. UNDER THE MEDICAID LAWYER YOU COULD MAKE. THE HEALTH CARE [inaudible] PART ELIGIBLE [inaudible] FOR MEDICAID MEDICARE ALL WOULD YOU WANT TO CALL IT. AND THEN THE THE ENTITLEMENT OF A YOUNG ONCE A PERSON'S IN. EL IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC MEDIC MEDICAID. THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE. AS AN ENTITLEMENT [inaudible] FOR EPS D. G. VALUATIONS. THAT COULD BE AN ONGOING EVALUATION THAT'S A SEVEN TO ONE RATIO YOU GETS. ONE DOLLAR WE PUT UP WE GET SEVEN FEDERAL. SO THAT'S NOT A BAD DEAL I'M I'M TALKING LIKE AN OLD COUNTY SUPERVISOR. CENTER MORE LOCK IN A WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS REAL WELL RIGHT IN THE COUNTY. SO SO. IT'S AN IS STILL IS A SEVEN TO ONE I CHECKED THIS WEEK. SO SO -- I THINK I TAKE YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE IF YOU LOOK AT JUST RUNNING THE SAME. FACILITIES YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS. BUT IF YOU START LOOKING AT OTHER FACILITIES. CREATING NEW FACILITIES. IT MIGHT BE -- THEY COULD BE A LOCKED FACILITY THEY COULD BE SPECIALIZED THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW WE COULD DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO YOU KNOW. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE -- WE'LL LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE KIND OF ISSUES. IN DECIDING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCH OR SO. DIRECTIONS NEED TO BE GIVEN TO YOU ON THIS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. MORE YOUR THOUGHTS ON A YEAH TOTALLY CENTER WILL WILL DEFINITELY CAN TO IT IT MAY BE A SITUATION LIKE STATE HOSPITALS FOR LICENSURE DOESN'T ALLOW FOR FEDERAL FUNDING AND COMPLETELY BUT IT'S UNUSUAL CATHERINE'S WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DON'T LIKE -- BUT I DISLIKE DAD ENTERS YOUR QUESTION OF CIVILITY IS I THINK A LOT OF THE SORT OF TREATMENT YOU DESCRIBE ARE ALREADY MOVING TOWARDS AT OUR LARGE FACILITIES -- YOU KNOW ARE USED TO HAVE TREATMENT TEAMS THAT HAVE THAT THERAPEUTIC STAFF AND SO I THINK THAT WORKS REALLY ALREADY STARTING NOW. THE CHECK IS A YOU WANTED TO AT YEAH I THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHOM DO WE SERVE -- WHAT CONTEXT OR ENVIRONMENT OR THE BEST SERVED IN AND WHAT SERVICES DO WHAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM? ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND THAT THERE ARE. SHORTER IN MID TERM TYPECAST BEFORE US AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THIS FIRST. TRANSFERRING OVER TO THE BAR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUTS A LENS YOU KNOW ESTABLISHES US WITH AN ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS WILL PUT UP PUTS US IN A PLACE TO TO HAVE THE SENATE GLASSES FOR THE LENSES THROUGH WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT THROUGH THE PROPER CONTEXT OF BEING. ABLE TO ANSWER -- YOU KNOW THOSE QUESTIONS MOVING FORWARD -- THERE WAS A BILL -- THEIR DUES -- SB -- TWO EIGHTY FOUR IN SB TWO FOUR CHANGED -- CHARGING RATE TO COUNTIES [inaudible] ON SENDING PEOPLE TO THE FACILITY THE STATE FACILITY -- BUDGETARY STANDPOINT -- INCREASING THE COUNTY FEES SO IN -- OR DECREASING ACOSTA TO BE A COMEDY APPROPRIATE COMBINATION DECREASE THE COST OR INCREASED THE IS ONE OF THE YOU'VE LOOKED AT THIS BILL -- AND WE HAD WE HAD THIRTY VOTES IN FAVOR EIGHT PEOPLE AGAINST THE OKAY -- A WE GOT A CONVERTIBLE. THE THIRTY VOTES IN FAVOR TODAY. JUST A FEW HOURS AGO -- I WANTED TO FIND OUT -- IF THOSE KINDS OF REVENUE SOURCES COULD PLAY -- A STRONGER ROLE IN HELPING WITH TRANSITIONING. OF THE SONG. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THESE. YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE TRANSITION PROCESS IS WHEN THE CAR WHEN I ALWAYS HEAR TRANSITION I ALWAYS THINK -- IT'S GONNA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND SOME MONEY ON YEAH I JUST KIND OF GOES STATUS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT. THE TRANSITION PLAN AND IT'S GOING. TO END UP COMING TO US. FOR A BUDGETARY -- CHANGE EITHER A CHANGE IN THE WAY YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY OR A REQUEST TO US. SO WE PASSED A OF IT WAS SENT OVER TO THIS THE OTHERS THE GREEN CARPET ASSEMBLY -- THE BILL YESTERDAY OR TODAY. SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT. YEAH I'M NOT. FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE SPECIFICS OF IT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER AN OPINION ON AT THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S GONNA GO TO FURTHER DELIBERATIONS. THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY COULD GENERATE THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. NO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS COMMON SIR THANK YOU OKAY WELL THEN -- WHAT WE WANT TO SEE AS YOU EXPLORE THAT BEFORE WE MAKE DECISIONS SO MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLORE THAT. BEFORE WE START FINALIZING THE BUDGET AGREEMENT HERE. ON THIS ISSUE. THAT'S MY FEELING. AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF YOU KNOW THIS IS A NEW ITEM IN A WE WANNA. I I PERSONALLY WANT TO MAKE IT WORK OKAY I'M I'M I'M REALLY. IGGY EXCITED THAT YOU'RE. ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND KIND OF WORK GET A GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER TO TRY. TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU DID IT RIGHT. AND THAT'S A BIG CABBIE OUT A COULD BENEFIT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS OF I KNOW YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE BEEN SERVING FOR ALL THESE NUMBERS OF YEARS TRUCKS SO. I THINK IT WOULD HELP. THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAY HAVE SUCCESSFUL LIVES IN THE FUTURE. AND DIVERT HIM FROM. OUR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND SO SO I I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS EXPLORED MANAGER -- AND GIVING -- TRANSITION YOU KNOW LIKE. A TRANSITION CAR -- PROCESS NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED OF FUN SOME FUNDING. TO ROUTE OF LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES -- SB OF TWO EIGHTY FOUR JUST ONE FOR MEDI CAL. THE PST T. OTHER KINDS OF SOURCES. SO I I I I HOPE THAT THAT COULD BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSION HERE IN OUR COMPANY. THANK YOU SIR ROLAND -- THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- BUT FOLLOWING EARNED SOME OF THIS COMMON DISCUSSION SO FAR. WE HAVE THIS INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. WE HAVE. WELL ONE THING WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF IS THAT OVER TIME. NOT ONLY DO THE LAWSUITS BUT DUE TO OTHER ACTIONS THAT. LEGISLATURE. AND AT FOUR MINUTES TAKEN. THE POPULATION OF JUVENILES THAT WE HOLD IN THE STATE FACILITY HAS GREATLY REDUCED. AND AND I THINK THAT SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE MANY OF IF WE AGAIN THINK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR OBJECTIVE WITH. IF ANY JUVENILES THAT ENCOUNTER. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OUR OBJECTIVE OF OF COURSE IS OF COURSE TO HAVE THAT BE THE LAST STOP IN SO. THE THE MORE WE CAN HANDLE THEM WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SYSTEMS NOT EVEN IN COUNTY. JUVENILE FACILITIES PURCHASING COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEMS AND SO WE'VE SEEN BOTH THERE'S THIS VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE POPULATION OF WHO WE OLD WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT WAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND AND WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT. SEVEN HUNDRED AND NOW IF WE LOOK. AT THE SAME TIME WE LOOK AT OUR POPULATION. IN THE COUNTY FACILITIES IN THE JUNE OKAY I MEAN CENTER BILLS GOT CHARTS LIKE I MEAN IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW MANY BEDS. EACH. COUNTY YOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE. AND YET THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES HELD IN THOSE COUNTY SO FOR EXAMPLE -- THE LOS ANGELES IS DOWN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX JUVENILES IN THEIR OWN FACILITIES. OR FOR THESE ARE OUR FACILITIES OKAY SORRY HIS OTHER. SENATOR BILLS WHEN HE SAID MINUTE WHICH HE PASSED OUT TWICE LAST WEEK HAD THE NUMBERS OF LA'S EVEN WITHIN THEIR OWN FACILITIES IT'S DROPPED. TO ITS THE IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER AS AS COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF BEDS IT HAS. ENDED AND THE CAPACITY AT HALAS SO IN ALMOST ALL OF OUR COUNTIES ARE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE HAVE SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE. ZERO KIDS IN THERE. I POINT THE IN THEIR JUVENILE FACILITY COUNTY BASED NO I POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE STATEWIDE BOTH ARE LOCALS. AND WE IS THE STATE HAVE BEEN MOVING IN THE DIRECTION. OF A DIFFERENT MODEL TO DEAL WITH JUVENILES. NOW I SEE THIS AS COMPLIMENTARY TO IN PARALLEL TO THAT MOVEMENT. THIS. ADOPTION OF MOVING THE DIVISION INTO MOVING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE INTO. THE DIVISION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND RENAMING IT THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. NOW THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER. THESE. YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN SMALLER FACILITIES COMMUNITY BASED. IS DEFINITELY A LEGITIMATE ONE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LOOP LEGISLATURE TO HAVE OVERTIME. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FIRST RECALL. WHO THESE JUVENILES ARE THAT ARE IN OUR STATE? FACILITIES THEY ARE. UNLESS OUR LOCALS ARE. CHARGING THEM VERY INACCURATELY THEY ARE. THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE. EXHIBITED THE MOST HAVE. COMMITTEDTHE MOST VIOLENT CRIMES IN WHO. WOULD THAT WOULD IF WE AGAIN TRUSTS THE PROCESS FOR WHICH THEY WERE CHARGED AND CONVICTED. MIGHT BE THE GREATEST RISK TO US IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT'S SAID WELL THAT TO ME DOES NOT NECESSARILY ARGUE AGAINST A MODEL THAT WOULD. ALLOW SMALLER FACILITIES AND MORE COMMUNITY BASED. IT'S CERTAINLY TELLS ME THAT. AS WE TRANSITION. AND GIVEN THAT. THAT WE HAVE DISCO HORDE NOW. WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THOSE TRANSITIONS VERY CAREFULLY. AND WE NEED TO SEE WHETHER THE TYPE OF CULTURE CHANGE IN THERAPEUTIC MODEL THAT. I BELIEVE THIS MISSION IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE WILL WORK. AND IN A WAY. WE COULDDEBATE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S BETTER TESTED. IN THESE MORE CENTRALIZED FACILITIES OR NOT I MEAN THERE'S DOWNSIDES DEFINITELY BECAUSE THOSE FACILITIES WERE MORE DESIGNED. TO BE LIKE PRISONS. AND THEY YOU KNOW SO THERE ARE DEFINITE DOWNSIDES. BUT I AM WILLING TO LOOK AT THIS IN. HELLO FIVE ONE USED INCREMENTAL STEPS BUT I'M WILLING TO HAVE THIS BE KIND OF OUR LABORATORY FOR CASTING. THESE NEW THINGS [inaudible] AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THIS TRANSITION IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NAME CHANGE SOONER SO THAT IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EMBARKING ON I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. M. MAYBE A MORE FORMALIZED STAKEHOLDER GROUP. AGAIN I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. SO THAT WE REALLY ARE FORMALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE ARE POTENTIALLY WHETHER WE PILOTED WHETHER WE DO IT FOR ALL THE FACILITIES BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR EXISTING STAFF. WELL SOME OF THEM HAVE SOCIAL WORK IN OTHER DEGREES STEP PRIMARILY THE EXISTING STAFF. YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE MODEL THAT THEY WERE EITHER TRAIN FOR HIRED FOR SO. THERE'S IN THE TRAILER BILL CLEARER -- AN ALLOCATION REQUEST OF RESOURCES AND CLEARED DESCRIPTION OF A WHOLE NEW ACADEMY A WHOLE NEW TRAINING COMPONENT WHICH I SUPPORT. BUT AS WE'RE PREPARING AND TRANSITIONING OUR EXISTING STAFF. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE. SOME OF THIS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY MODEL. ALREADY. TO TO IMPLEMENTED WITHIN SOME OF THESE FACILITIES SO THAT. WE CAN IN A WAY TESTED AND SO THAT ARE EXISTING STAFF CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE ADULT SIDE WE HAVE CREATED THESE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES IN A COUPLE OF ADULT PRISONS IN RG DONOVAN IN LANCASTER A COUPLE OTHER PLACES WHERE WE WE USE SMALLER COHORTS OF INDIVIDUALS -- AND WE HAVE -- WE ENGAGE A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF OF FAT PROGRAMMING WITH THEM -- WHEN WHILE THEY'RE STILL HOUSED IN OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THESE ADULTS THE MOST OF THEIR PROGRAMMING AND A GOOD PORTION OF THEIR DAYS SPENT IN NEEDS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY TYPE MODEL -- SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT START SOONER THAN LATER AND THAT MAY REQUIRE US HAVING TO DEVELOP A NORTH P. IN USING AN EXTERNAL ENTITY. BUT IT COULD ALSO ALLOW US. TO TO START ARTICULATING WHAT IS WHERE CERTAINLY WE HAVE A MISSION AND I DON'T MEAN I'M NOT IN ANY WAY MINIMIZING THAT THE TRAILER BILL HAS A MISSION BUT IN OUR FEED COULD START ARTICULATING. TYPE OF THERAPEUTIC MANY WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND THE TYPE OF METRICS WE MAY WANT TO BE TRYING TO ALSO ACHIEVED SO THAT THEN IF WE ENDED UP. ENGAGING SOME EXTERNAL PARTNERS TO PILOT THIS AS WE DO THIS TRANSITION. IT IT'S BENEFICIAL BOTH IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR TRAINING IN IN MULTIPLE WAYS -- SO I I THINK IT IS WORTH IT. TO TO ALSO CONSIDER DOING THAT. AND THAT'S NOT PART OF THE TRAILER BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH. THE DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION AND THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AN OVER WHETHER THERE'S OPENNESS TO THAT -- YEAH AND THOSE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW. ONE HOW WE MIGHT PROCEED IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU'VE PUT BEFORE US. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO MAKE ANY COMMENT TO THAT OR THE LA NUMBERS. OKAY FOR YES SO IN LOS ANGELES IS [inaudible] ONE THERE ARE. THIS IS FOR THEIR COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT TOTAL BEDS. AND THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE USED IN THEM. WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S ONLY 24% FALL. AND THERE'S A TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE BEDS OF VACANCY. SOME OF THEM NOW REALLY KIDS INTO AN AND LA COUNTY YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR OWN STATE FACILITIES IS A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX NOW I SAY THAT. NOT TO ARGUE. THAT WE START FILLING UP THOSE COUNTY BEDS I I'M NOT. SO I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYONE MISS UNDERSTAND ME I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT WE FILL UP THOSE COUNTY BEDS -- BUT RATHER THAT. IT'S A DEMONSTRATION THAT ARE. THAT ARE IF IT TOO APPROACHING JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM A MORE LIKE HEY HERE'S A KID WITH A PROBLEM LET'S TRY TO GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO HELP HIM FIX IT VERSUS JUST. PUNISHING THEM IS SOMETHING THAT IS CLEARLY BEEN BEING EMBRACED ACROSS THE STATE IN ADDITION TO THE STATISTICS THAT JUVENILE CRIME. IS OVERALL DOWN BOTH THINGS GOOD ANYWAY YOU GO AHEAD [inaudible] THE M.. WE CERTAINLY THE THE THE POPULATIONS THAT WE DO RECEIVE IT DJJ -- INCREASINGLY SO OUR YOUTH WHO. OTHERWISE WOULD BE CHARGED AS ADULTS PROP FIFTY SEVEN YES -- IS HAD A IN IMPACT IN TERMS OF WHO IT IS THIS COMING TO DJJ AND PERHAPS WITHOUT THAT WHAT -- WHERE WHERE THEY WOULD BE HOUSED AND THAT? THE YOU KNOW. THE IDEA THAT WE COULD BRING THIS DIVERSITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVE OUTCOMES OTHER THAN INTERGROUP CONFLICT. REINFORCEMENT OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENCES BE A GANG AFFILIATION OR WHAT HAVE YOU. CAN TO HELP THEM LEARN HOW TO BE ABLE TO WORKACROSS PERCEIVED DIFFERENCES AND CERTAINLY ITSELF FUNDAMENTAL. YOU KNOW NEED FOR A USED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GROUP THEY BELONG TO ITS ITS EVOLUTIONARY IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A TASK OF A YOUNG PERSON TO FIGURE OUT AN IDENTITY AND A GROUP THAT THEY BELONG. TO AND THE IDEA OF LEARNING HOW TO BE ABLE TO WORK ACROSS DIFFERENCES ACROSS GROUPS IN A SMALL SETTING. TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARDS SUPPORTING EACH OTHER BEING SUCCESSFUL HAVING A DIFFERENCE ARE ABOUT COME WITH REGARD TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE -- THAT THAT THOSE SMALL GROUPS ARE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL BE A YOU KNOW A SMALL FACILITY OR SMALL GROUPS WITHIN A FACILITY BUILDING THAT KIND OF A THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY WHERE YOU'RE LEARNING THOSE. REALLY SORT OF COMMUNITY RESTORATION SKILLS ASSOCIATED WITH HOW TO LIVE PEACEFULLY WITHIN A COMMUNITY WITH PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELVES IN THE LIKE FIT INTO IT AND SO. I THINK THE ON THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN YOU TO ROUTE IT. TERMS OF OPEN DISCUSSION OR WHAT HAVE YOU -- BUT IT IT DOES CORRESPOND WITH REGARD TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAS TRYING TO BUILD STRONG CARING COMMUNITIES WITHIN DJJ AND REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW. FUTURE DISCUSSIONS OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THE THERAPEUTIC MODEL THE MISSOURI MODEL SO TO SPEAK. YOU KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN DJJ ON THE UNIT WITH THREE FOUR SMALLER GROUPS ALL GOING THROUGH THIS JOURNEY YOU KNOW. TO TOGETHER AND I KNOW THAT YOU NO LONGER TO CONVERSATION PEOPLE THROWN OUT THERE IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE DJJ WHERE BEST TO TREAT THE THE YOUTH AND THE LIKE I FEEL THAT MUCH OF WHAT IT IS WE WANT. TO ACCOMPLISH -- WE CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TOWARD -- WITH REGARD TO JOB ONE AT HAND N TERMS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE HAVEN'T HOW BEST TO SERVE THEM TODAY TOMORROW -- AND AND MOVING FORWARD. SO WHAT I'D LIKE IS THAT AS WE HOLD THIS OPEN THAT WEEK. CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS FOR HOW WE IN COMPLETE RESPECTING THAT BE WE'RE GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION AND WE NEED. TRAINING COMPONENTS WE NEED ALL THAT THAT WE ALSO MIGHT. HOW WE MIGHT INCORPORATE? SOME PORTION OF THIS THERAPY TO COMMUTING MODEL SOONER THAN LATER SO THAT WE BEGIN TO YOU KNOW NOT ONLY TESTED BUT HAVE. ALL OF US TO INTERACT WITH THE FACILITIES AND WITH THE JUVENILES YOU DON'T SEE IT BEING APPLIED IT'S THAT PRAXIS. SOY SO WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN ACHIEVE AND IN THIS -- IN. THIS BILL. THIS BUDGET YEAR IN IN MODIFICATION TO THE TRAILER BILL. NOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF COMMUNITY HERE THAT ONE OR PUBLIC HERE THAT ONE AT TALK ON THE PUBLIC MIKE SO LET ME JUST SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS THEY WANNA MAKE IT SORRY. YES GO AHEAD CENTER ABOUT JUST ONE THOUGH IF THE COUNTY FACILITY ABOUT A THIRD FULL. THERE'S YOUR I KNOW IT'S TRUE IN MY COUNTY. OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- THERE ARE SOME OF OUR FACILITIES THERE. NOT THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED OR NOT THEIR VACATION AND OTHER. STE THE SOME OF ARE FAIRLY SMALL. AND OF IT SEEMS TO ME THE IT WOULD WISE TO DO MAYBE -- A SURVEY OF COUNTIES AND FACILITIES. TO MAYBE HAVE INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT POSSIBILITY -- YOU KNOW USING SOME OF THOSE. YOU KNOW NOT YOU NOT USEFACILITIES BUT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN GOOD SHAPE AND ALL. THAT WOULD FIT THE NEEDS OF YOUR MODEL YOUR PROGRAM. THAT THAT -- THAT'S A POSSIBILITY JUST SO. YOU DO A SURVEY THE COUNTY AND WHAT KIND OF FACILITIES THEY HAVE. ADD AND MANAGE SURE -- WE'VE SPENT IN THE BUDGET THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. GIVING TO COUNTY JUVENILE PROBATION PROGRAMS. FOR GRANTS TO HELP THEM OPERATOR BUILDER FACILITIES. SO WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF FUNDS. TO FUND THESE FACILITIES SO -- I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF DISCUSSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M HELEN ROTH DOWN FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND FIRST OF ALL WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOUGH IS IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE WONDERFUL PILOT THAT WAS AGREED LAST YEAR. WERE MORE PEOPLE FROM ADULT PRISONS ARE BEING PUT IN DJJ AND WE THINK THE DJJ COULD BE AN AND THERAPEUTIC COMPUTE. COMMUNITY A TO SENATOR BELLS POINT WITHIN -- THE ADULT FACILITIES ARE VERY FEW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS I BELIEVE THE A THAT. YET THEY EXIST WITHIN THE USE THE JUVENILE FACILITIES SO. THE I. D. A. GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO THERE'S ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND PRISONERS WHO BELOW ARE BELOW THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IN THE ADULT PRISONERS IN THE ADULT PRISONS THAT COULD BE SERVED. WITH IN THESE PRISONS SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS WE SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MOVING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE. THAT COULD COME INTO A MUCH MORE THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THEY TOO ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY. IT WOULD ALSO SOLVE OUR OVERCROWDING PROBLEM WHICH IS NOW HAS AS UNDER THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE. AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE WOULD -- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU WOULD DO THIS THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN SKINNER. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GEORGE VIA. I AM -- PROGRAM ASSISTING WITH MOTIVATED INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP FOR PUBLIC ADVANCEMENT WERE AN ADVOCACY GROUP IN IN SALINAS COMPRISE OF OF RECIPIENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN THE C. Y. SYSTEM. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT JIM -- IN THE SALINAS OUT CURRENTLY -- UC DAVIS STUDENT. AT MID TERM AT THREE O'CLOCK -- SKEWS ME PATIENT NISSEN WHAT BUT I THINK I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO COMMON REPRESENT ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILIES OUR INSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE -- I CURRENTLY GO INSIDE THERE EVERY WEDNESDAY -- AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AT THE JOKES DOING IN THE STAFF TO ALLOW ME COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GO IN HERE I'M ALSO THE FULL SUPPORT. OF OF UNAPOLOGETICALLY OF OF TRANSITIONING DOES THIS INSTITUTION INTO HUMAN HEALTH SERVICES INSTITUTION WHERE YOUTH ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CELL WITHERS THEY CAN ENJOY THOUGH THE OUTSIDE FREEDOM YOU KNOW THERE'S A STAFF ATTORNEY MARTY JEANNIE WHO HAS MODEL HE REMEMBERS WHEN I WAS IN ITS IN. THE PRESS THE INSTITUTION AND HIS WATER WAS. THEM OUTSIDE GIVEN PLAY GAMES SPORTS AND THEY'LL BE TIRED A GOING DINNER. SHOWER OF READY TO GO TO BED AND REDUCE THE FIGHTS AND THE MODEL ALWAYS WORK -- SINCE I'VE BEEN GOING INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE YEAH I SEE THE THE CULTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. ABOUT HALF THE STAFF THAT ARE REALLY CARING AND DOWN TO SUPPORT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE YOU GOT OTHER STAFF THAT. THEY'RE STILL KIND OF STUCK ON THE PART OF THE PUNISHMENT MODEL AND THAT PUNISHMENT MORE REALLY MESSED UP CALIFORNIA IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE I WANT. TO QUOTE UNQUOTE OR HIGHLIGHT WITH MR BILLS ARE 75% OF PEOPLE WITHIN THREE YEARS RECENTLY. AS A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S WHAT'S LOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS IN I KNOW WE'RE ALL HUMANS AND WE ALWAYS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT -- I'LL NEVER POINT FINGERS ON ANYONE AND STATE YOUR FALL IT'S YOUR FAULT BUT A LOT OF FRIENDS TO THAT SYSTEM I LOST. YOUR TO DRUGS AND AND AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT I'M WITH THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN OR WILL OF ONLY ONE A FEW THAT CAN GO AND GO TO UNIVERSITY. AND THE ONE OF THE OLD OLD OLD MODELS DON'T WORK. YOU KNOW AND I LIKE I SAID I APPRECIATE THE THEY ALSO KNEW HIM ONLY. NO THE BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CARE ABOUT ARGUING OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE IN THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND I I I'M I'M I'M PROUD THAT I'M IN A POSITION WHERE I CAN SEE CHANGE THE HEARTS OF THE STAFF THAT ARE IN THERE THAT ARE STRUGGLING YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE LEARN THESE BEHAVIOR THAT. THEY'RE JST NOT HEALTHY AND AND THE OLD MODEL DIDN'T WORK BUT I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BRAVERY IN THE CURRENT IS AT THE GOVERNOR AND THEN YOU ALL HERE HAVE TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMANS HERE. ENOUGH THIS RECIDIVISM RATES NOT WORKING WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT. NOT CALL LASTED FROM THE NEEDS A LOT OF FIXING TO DO A LOT OF A LOT OF JUST. COLLECTIVE THINKING COLLECTIVE STOCK PRICES -- AND AND LASTLY I I I I WANT TO JUST REALLY REALLY STRESS THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE ASKING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT THEY ALSO ME AND I HER CHUCKLE WHEN ASKED TO MY I'VE BEEN IN THERE WITH THEM AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S A START BUT LIKE. I SAID THE THE THERE NEEDS TO BE A MORE OF AN IMPACT LIKE YOU KNOW. ASSN THE STAFF LOOK IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CARE ABOUT THE SHOW PEOPLE EITHER DON'T SYSTEM THERE THAT. BUILDING PRISONS ALL THE TIME WE CAN ARE THERE BUT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE DEALING WITH THE THE STRESS THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING ON AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. pON BEHALF OF THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WE DO SUPPORT THE MOVE A DJ INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THAT SAID WE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CULTURE OF NORMALCY THAT MR SUPPLE SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT CULTURE OF NORMALCY CAN BE CREATEDIN THE CURRENT PHYSICAL BUILDINGS THAT DJ USES AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MISERY MODEL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE STRUCTURES. THEY ARE JUST PRISON LIKE THEY ARE PRISONS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE VISION THAT MR SUPPLE PUTS FORWARD OF A CULTURE OF NORMALCY IN A THERAPEUTIC APPROACHTO THE WORK IS. A GREAT VISION AND TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE TO DIFFERENT PHYSICAL STRUCTURES CLOSER TO COMMUNITY SMALLER NUMBER OF YOUTH BEING HELD TOGETHER. IN A WAY WHERE THEIR FAMILIES CAN BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED. WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE YOUTH BEING SENT TO DJ NOW AND TO NOT. ACCEPT WITHOUT QUESTIONING THAT THESE ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST YOUTH AS I'VE HEARD THEM DESCRIBED THIS MORNING. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COUNTY DISPARITIES IN WHO IS BEING SENT TO DJJ AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF SACRAMENTO ARE WORSE THAN THE YOUTH OF THEIR NEIGHBORING COUNTY. SAN JOAQUIN I THINK WE NEED TO ASK WHY ARE SOME COUNTIES SENDING USED TO DJJ IN OTHER COUNTIES OR NOT. AND WHAT IS IT WE CAN PROVIDE. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO FIX THAT PROBLEM SO THAT IN EVERY COUNTY THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR EVERY YOUTH THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MIKE BELOW SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND THE SECTION OF CJ KNOWN AS A JUVENILE COURT JUDGES OF CALIFORNIA JUST AS THE DJJ POPULATION IS UNIQUE SO TO R. G. JUVENILE COURT JUDGES. THEY TEND TO BE JUDGES WHO DO NOT CYCLE THROUGH ASSIGNMENTS AS ROUTINELY AS OTHERS THEY ARE SO THEY ARE DEDICATED TO JUVENILE JUSTICE AND TND TO STAY IN THOSE ASSIGNMENTS A LONG TIME. WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE DO SUPPORT IN CONCEPT THIS CHANGE YOU'VE USED THE PHRASE IS CULTURE CHANGE THAT SORT OF THING IT IS A MOVEMENT FROM. A CRIMINAL JUSTICE MODEL TO A REHABILITATIVE MODEL -- OUR JUDGES DON'T AT ALL -- MINIMIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIMES THAT LEAD TO DE DE DE JJ COMMITMENT. BUT WE THINK THIS HAS PROMISE AND WE WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE AND APPRECIATE THE THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE MOVE AND WANT TO WORK ON IT. THANK YOU. DONNA DOES NOT EVEN THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT BUT HOPE THAT THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST THE END OF THE DISCUSSION BUT AN IMPETUS FOR GREATER TRANSFORMATION THE CURRENT LACK OF OVERSIGHT. CORONATIONS BETWEEN OUR YOUTH SERVING SYSTEMS MEANS THAT OUR YOUTH ARE RECEIVING. POOR SERVICES FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY PRICE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE COMMUNITIES WE HAVE IMPACTED USE FAMILIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE WE HAVE DOCTORS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE STATE. WHO HAVE INSIDE AND WE WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND CREATING A FORMALIZED AND TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE? ADDITIONALLY AS WE SEEM TO ME BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BENEFITS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE THEM COME IN AND START WORK WITH THE RE ENTRY. WE UNDERSTAND THE RE ENTRY PLANNING NEEDS TO HAPPEN THE SECOND THAT THIS COMES IN. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU HAVE YOUTH WHO ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES SO FAR AWAY FROM THE COMMUNITIES. THAT BRIDGE CAN'T BE BUILT IN A WAY THAT IS TRULY SUPPORTIVE TO ENSURE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO BECOME. PART OF THOSE COMMUNITIES LEADERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO SO. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M SUPER RALPH FROM THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MOVE -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND WE TOTALLY. AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE CULTURE CHANGE WILL BE IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO HOPE THAT IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL WILL ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO DO SOMETHING MORE WITH THIS -- DJJ IS JUST A SMALL PART OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THAT WHAT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT WHETHER. THE SYSTEM SHOULD CONTINUE IN ITS PRESENT INSTITUTIONAL FORM THOSE ARE REALLY EXCELLENT QUESTIONS AND WE HOPE THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. SOMETHING MORE WILL BE SET INTO MOTION TO PROVIDE IN A IN A STAKEHOLDER FORMAT FOR THOSE QUESTIONS TO BE FURTHER EXPLORED FOR COUNTIES CAPACITY TO BE. RESEARCHED FOR OUGHT TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT WOULD WORK BETTER FOR SERVING THIS POPULATION AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THE AGENCY IF IT'S TRULY TO BE. TO TO FULFILL THE GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF TRANSFORMING JUVENILE JUSTICE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO BRING OVER THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AT THE SEC. PUT THEM INTO THIS AGENCY AND PROVIDE A POLICY VOICE FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA -- THE GROUP OF PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY -- THEY'RE VERY EXPERIENCED ADVOCATES AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE PREPARED SOME PROPOSED BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RAISED THIS MORNING. HAVING -- CALLING FOR DATA ON BETTER OUTCOMES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO USED IN THE SYSTEM SO WE HAVE A A BASIS FOR MEASUREMENT -- A CREATING A TASK FORCE OR ADVISORY GROUP THAT WOULD HAVE SOME MORE FORMAL ROLE IN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. ON AND ON AND EXPANDING SOMEWHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE NEW AGENCY AND SO WE HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MAUREEN WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL -- TO MOVE DJJ OUT OF THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. BUT WITH CONCERN THAT AT NAME CHANGE ALONE. WILL NOT DELIVER BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OR THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE RESERVE RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT -- LOOKING AT CONDITIONS IN THE DJJ FACILITIES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT -- THEY REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY ON SAFE AND NON REHABILITATIVE. BECAUSE OF FACTORS THAT ARE ENDEMIC TO CONGREGATE INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE LARGE THE PRISON LIKE AND THEY'RE FAR FROM YOUNG PEOPLE'S HOMES AND FAMILIES. AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU SIMPLY FARE BETTER WHEN THEY'RE IN SMALLER SETTINGS THAT ARE CLOSER TO HOME WHERE THEY CAN MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND SO IN ADDITION TO THE MOVE. WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE A PET IT AND IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY TOWARDS WHAT WE KNOW WORKS SMALLER COMMUNITY BASED OPTIONS. THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY -- AND THERE'S HAS BEEN HAS BEEN POINTED OUT PLENTY OF SPACE AVAILABLE LOCALLY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TIFFANY WHITE WITH A C. R. U. CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THERE'S FURTHER CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE TRANSITION. AND WE WOULD ASK THAT ANY CONVERSATIONS -- WHETHER IT BE A STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION OR TASK FORCE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ON HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KATIE DIXON ALMOST POLICY FELLOW WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. I AM HERE TODAY AS A SURVIVOR OF DJJ FACILITIES. I SPENT FIVE YEARS IN SEVEN MONTHS INSIDE OF THE CAMERI -- FACILITY DOWN IN VENTURA. EIGHT IS DEFINITELY A PRISON THERE'S NO MISTAKING ABOUT IT. THERE WAS NO THEIR REHABILITATIVE GOING ON UP IN THE AIR. FOR ME WHEN PEOPLE ASK HOW IT WORKS. WHAT I LOVE TO COMPARE IT TO IS RYKER'S ISLAND? WHEN I HEAR ABOUT RYKER'S ISLAND I THINK HEY THOSE ARE THE THINGS I WENT THROUGH? WHEN I WAS A SEE YA THAT'S WHAT IT WAS KNOWN WHEN I WAS THERE -- I WAS THERE WHEN THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT STARTING WHEN THEY TRANSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY TO DJJ. THE CONDITIONS ABSOLUTELY DETERIORATED FURTHER NOTHING CHANGED -- EXCEPT THAT IT GOT WORSE WHAT I SAW CHANGE WAS MORE OF A AN INFLUX OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FORCE UPON US -- JUST THAT WAS LIKE THE MAIN CHANGE THAT I'VE SEEN -- IS FAR AS I THINK THE THE FOLKS HAD MENTIONED AS FAR AS LIKE OUT DATED DATA TO WORK WITH AGAIN. SOME OF THE FOLKS A CJ CJ HAS A FANTASTIC -- REPORT THAT THEY AND THE OLD FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TITLE ON MET PROMISES I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET A HOLD OF IT IF YOU GUYS WE WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT. REPORT AT THE LAST HEARING WE WERE HERE AT THE LAST HEARING YOU SAY THE SAME THING THAT YOU HAD OUTDATED INFORMATION. YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOT A HOLD OF AND MAKE PROMISES ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK SOMEONE I'M PRETTY SURE THEY CAN GET YOU A COPY -- YES SO I WANT TO MIRROR WHAT EVERYONE ELSE SAID AS FAR AS CON FURTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD I REALLY LOVE THE WOULD -- THE GUY SAID UP THERE ABOUT THE STAKEHOLDER -- GROUP I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO GET THAT. PUT TOGETHER AND I REALLY BELIEVE WE HAVE TO HAVE. THE CBO'S AT AT THE TABLE WHEN YOU GUYS ARE DISCUSSING HIS MAJOR MOVING A RANGER IN A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION WE CAN GET THIS DONE WITH THE EXPERTS. YOU GUYS GOTTA HAVE SOMEONE IN THERE WITH THE LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S HERE DOING OR TRYING TO CHANGE IT AROUND YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING WITH US WITHOUT US AND WE STAND FIRM BY DAY. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RENEE MANNER WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE I JUST WANT TO COME UP HERE TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE MOVE FROM AT DJJ TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- BUT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT MORE BE DONE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THIS TRANSITION PROVIDES MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS NEW STRUCTURE. AND IDEALLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT A LONG TERM PLAN NEEDS TO CONSIDER COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES AND I COMMUNITY FOCUS FOR YOU SEE TO BE SERVED. I AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- BUT IN THIS TRANSITION TO TO TO OF THE DJJ TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE PROCESS INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS -- IN THE COMMUNITY AND OTHER EXPERTS TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION I IS SUCCESSFUL THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S CLEAR BOUNDARY I WAS HERE -- I WASN'T SEE WAY WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN ITS NAME CHANGE TO DJJ. AND NOTHING. REALLY CHANGED IN WITH THIS NAME CHANGE I DON'T REALLY SEE THE PROBLEMS THAT I SAW THEY'RE CHANGING. IT DOES I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TO DISSOLUTION BACK DOWN TO A COUNTY LEVEL AND PERHAPS THE JUVENILES TO FEEL SILLY THESE THERE COULD. YOU KNOW GO UP TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AS C. WAY DOES. THE PROBLEMS THAT I SAW THERE WERE -- BEFORE I EVEN WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE. POINTLESS AND IN FACT HORRIFIC AND SO I GOT MY GED BEFORE I WENT THERE AND I GOT INTO A BUNCH OF OCCASIONAL PROGRAMS% WHICH ARE STILL DRAWN TO THIS DAY. THEN THE LAST -- YOU KNOW WITH. THE STAFF THERE'S JUST RETRAINING THEM ISN'T GOING TO HELP. HOW THEY VIEW US I MEAN IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHO THEY ARE AND THERE AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST NEGATIVE? AND TO BE JUST A NEGATIVE PERSON AROUND KIDS IS. YOU KNOW NOT HELPING THEM AT ALL AND NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT. SO THE STAFF NEEDS TO REALLY BE REEVALUATED ALL TOGETHER ON WHO CAN WORK WITH KIDS AND WHO'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL WHEN THEY WORK WITH THE CHILDREN. THE LAST [inaudible] WHEN I? LEFT THERE I WENT INTO A HALFWAY HOUSE AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT STARTS. AT THE HELP ME SIGN UP FOR SCHOOL AND THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I DID BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED TO GO HOME SO I HAD AS A SET BASE I WAS AT A JOB WHERE I CAN MAKE MONEY I GOT AN APARTMENT I HAD I STARTED SCHOOL SO I COULD. FURTHER MY EDUCATION AND ALL THESE THINGS COULD BE DONE ON A COUNTY LEVEL IF I WAS THAT SAFE I'D SPENT MY WHOLE TIME THERE MY LAST SIX MONTHS COULD HAVE BEEN RESTRUCTURING LIKE HELL TO GET OUT AND WHERE CAN GO AND WHAT I CAN DO SO. THIS IS ON A COUNTY LEVELS WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO GET INVOLVED WITH FOR LOW PROGRAMS OR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR WHEREVER ELSE YOU. CHOOSE TO WORK OUT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RUTH WITH MORE AND I'M HERE TODAY AS THE GRANDMOTHER OF A YOUNG MAN THAT WAS SENT -- TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO SEE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY. HE WAS TRIED AS AN ADULT AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE IMPACT THAT IT HAD HE'S HAD A REAL STRUGGLE. TRYING TO READJUST TO SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THE PUNITIVE APPROACH. THAT SIMPLER INSIDE THE CD THERE WAS CALIFORNIA'S WITH ALREADY. WHO IS NOW CDC ARE THEY COMBINE? SO I WOULD SAY TO YOU I WOULD ASK YOU AS NOT ONLY IS THE GRANT -- BUT IS THE TAXPAYER. THE FEW WOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL IN WHICH IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE. AND IT'S REALLY. REFRESHING TO SEE THAT IT'S FINALLY. BE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IT IS. THE PUNITIVE METHODS IT'S NOT WORK THEY NEED. SOME EMOTIONAL HEALING. SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MYSELF AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. A MINUTE AGO OKAY SELL -- I WORK WITH COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR RESEARCHERS JUSTICE AND OAKLAND ALAMEDA COUNTY -- SOUL I'M ONE OF THE PRODUCTS I WAS GOING I GREW UP IN JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. NOT SEE YA NOT DJJ HOURS -- SENTENCED TO ADULT PRISON AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN OR AYE SIR TWENTY YEARS SO I CAME A LOT OF EXPERIENCES FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE ON THIS ISSUE -- AND I APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE -- THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX I APPRECIATE LOOKING OUT MODELS AT THEIR OUT OF STATE. BUT I THINK IN CALIFORNIA HERE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING WE HAVE LEADERSHIP -- TO CREATE A ROLE MODEL RIGHT TO FIX CALIFORNIA. ON A LOT OF THAT REALLY BRINGS IN TO BRING IN THE PEOPLE AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE TO DJJ SYSTEM TO SEE WHAT A SYSTEM. CORRECTION SYSTEMS AT A YOUNG AGE -- WE ARE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE IN IS THAT WE ALSO CLOSEST TO LUCIEN TO THE SOLUTION. DOESN'T EXCLUDE EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES -- THE ALL WE SEEN WHEN IT COMES TO THIS WE HIRE CONSULTANTS. THE HAVE ALL THIS EXPERIENCE WITH SYSTEM RIGHT AND IT'S A IT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE ALL INPUT. BUT WHEN WE DO COVER STAKEHOLDERS I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE ALSO THE REYES CONSOLE THAT WE CAN HAVE. ON THESE ISSUES -- PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE PROCESSES OF SEE WHY EIGHT OR WORKING ON POLICY AND ARE HERE PRESENTTODAY -- BUT I THINK YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO REALLY REALLY JUST -- EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT OUR WHO ALWAYS BLACK IN THE DEFINITION -- THAT WERE -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT USE WE TALK ABOUT ADULTS -- YOU KNOW YOUNG ADULTS WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS LIKE A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD IS THE CHILD RIGHT AND AT THE DESK. WHO WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO WERE -- CONCERNED ABOUT -- AND IF ANYBODY HERE HAS CHILDREN BEST -- THIRTEEN THESE ARE THE SAME AGE AS THE PEOPLE OUR ANTI SYSTEMS RIGHT SO WE GOT TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT TO THAT ERROR THAT LANDS. ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. EVEN GETTING AWAY FROM THE DEFINITION OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. SO I JUST WANT IS EMPHASIZED THE HUMANITY. IN THEM AND THE CHILDHOOD AND THAT THEY ARE CHILDREN THAT DO HAVE -- THE CAPACITY NINETY TO REHABILITATE BUT TO EXCEL RIGHT I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT LIKE WHEN I JUST LOOKING. TO HAVE PEOPLE JUST -- REHABILITATE BUT GET OUT AND ACTUALLY BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY TO HAVE SOMETHING -- TO GIVE GIVE BACK SUCH AS MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE -- HAVING SERVED TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON -- FROM THE AGE OF SIXTEEN SO I REALLY SUPPORT THIS MOVE -- I DO BELIEVE -- THAT IT'S IN THE RIGHT STEP. AND TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE ONE ANOTHER IN THIS DIALOGUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AND BECAUSE WE'RE ALL STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT ACROSS THE COLORS IN THIS ISSUE SIZE WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AND PRONOUNCE HER SUPPORT. MATA TERAKHIR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE'D LIKE TO JOIN THE CHORUS AS WELL. OF ENSURING THAT THERE IS A STRONG STREAK STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SAYS. THE PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TO MOVE DJJ -- IT IS CERTAINLY AN APPROACH THAT WE RECOGNIZE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- DID YOU NOT JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT WITHIN THE ADULT CORRECTIONS SYSTEM IT IS I AS A SEPARATE MODEL AND SO WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND SEE THE BENEFITS TO THAT AND IN THIS SHIFT -- PROVISION CHIEFS AND AND IN CONCERT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND MANY OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS. ON THAT THAT -- THE FOLKS HERE BEEN A PART OF WE'VE REALLY SEEN AN INCREDIBLE -- EVOLUTION IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WAS MENTIONED WITH SIGNIFICANT -- AN HISTORIC DECLINES IN -- RESTORATIONS AND DETENTION RATES -- AND SO WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS AS KIND OF THE NEXT PHASE OF THAT WE DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE. THE WONDERFUL TRAJECTORY IN EVOLUTION -- THAT DJJ HAS TAKEN ON BOTH WITH FERAL AND BEYOND TO MAKE SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND AND WORKING ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ALL OF WHICH WE THINK -- THIS PROPOSAL HERE WILL CONTINUE -- TO ENHANCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- I DO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT -- BASED ON CHANGES FROM THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS BACK -- COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS NOW WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH DJJ ON THE RE ENTRY AND DISCHARGE OF USE COMING OUT OF A DJJ ONTO COUNTY PAROLE -- FOR WORKING WITH YOUTH WE HAVE DONE SIGNIFICANT WORK IN INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND WORKING WITH MISTER SUPPLE AND AND HIS TEAM ON WHAT THAT RE ENTRY LOOKS LIKE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THOSE YOUTH ABOUT SITUATED COMING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO RECOGNIZING THAT. THIS WOULD BE A SHIFT TO A NEW STATE AGENCY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT PROGRESS IS MAINTAINED AND BUILT UPON AS WELL IN TERMS OF THAT CONNECTION FOR YOU COMING BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES -- SO AGAIN WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL I THINK AS AS YOU NOTED MADAM CHAIR THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES TO TO LOOKING AT WORKING WITH ARGUE TO WE HAVE -- IN IN THE SYSTEM IN DJJ WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND AND WOULD WANT TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THIS IN THE MOST THOUGHTFUL WAY SO WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY LOOK FOR TO BE IN PART OF IT FURTHER THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT WE WILL NOW GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN THE STAFF COMPLAINT. IN FOR UNIT AND WE HAVE -- JOE GALVIN WHO'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WE HAVE -- RAY WESLEY WHO'S OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL THREE OF ERIC SWANSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FISCAL SERVICES -- MANAGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH THE I JEEZ FINDINGS OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH OUR PROPOSAL ITSELF REGISTERED YOUR PROPOSAL OKAY. THANKS ONCE AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES -- WE ARE REQUESTING. NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. TO IMPLEMENT A NEW REGIONAL MODEL FOR REVIEWING INVESTIGATING AND MAKE COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AS WELL AS REVISED CDC OURS GRIEVANCE REVIEW PROCESS. WITH ME TODAY'S JOE GALVIN WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND HE'S GOING TO DESCRIBE OUR PROPOSAL. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO RESTRUCTURE THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS BY MOVING THE OFFICE OF APPEALS -- ADAM DID DIVISIONS -- INTO THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH INTERNAL OVERSIGHT AT FTA I VISUAL TO THE DIVISION LITTLE INSTITUTIONS. AND MOVE THE STAFF OFFENDER GRIEVANCE COMPLAINT INQUIRY PROCESS INTO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND BASED ON THE O. I. G.'S RECOMMENDATIONS ESTABLISH REGIONAL UNITS PERFORMING CORY'S SPECIFICALLY IS FOR ASSOCIATED THE STAFF IS KIND OF COMPLAINTS. IT WILL BE STAFFED UP WITH IT SAID A SIMILAR MODEL TO OUR CURRENT OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. WITH -- FOLKS WHO WILL BE CONDUCTING CORY'S OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL PROCESS SO THEY WILL HAVE A NEW CHAIN OF COMMAND. INTRO FOR ALSO CONDUCTED A FACT FINDING INAND INCREASE. AND AUTO GENERATE INVESTIGATIONS OF WARRANTED. THE OFFICE OF THE APPEALS AGAIN WOULD BE INDEPENDENT WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO OVERTURN ANY. DA GRIEVOUS DECISION. AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL LEVEL AS WELL AS TRAINING DESERVE DA GRIEVANCES. AND WITHIN -- THE DIVISION OF CORRECTION POLICY RESURGENT INTERNAL OVERSIGHT IS ALSO THE OFFICE OF ARTS IN COURT COMPLIANCE. A NEW POSITION WAS CREATED THEIR CHIEF RISK OFFICER ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT -- AND THEY WILL SERVE ALONG WITH THE OFFICE OF ON OF COURSE THE PLANS TO HONOR THE PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE FIDELITY WITH THE RAGS. AND USE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SOFTWARE TO PREVENT -- FALLING OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE WICKS -- I COULD HAVE HAD IT -- WHERE THE CAR? INSPECTOR GENERAL SPOKE FIRST BUT SINCE WE ARE. ACTING ON YOUR PROPOSAL I WANTED YOU TO BUT SINCE WE HAVE HAD. A J. LACK REQUESTED IN AUDITOR'S REPORT. ON THE WHOLE COMPLAINT PROCESS AND CLEARLY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS VERY INVOLVED IN THAT -- I OF COURSE ONE HERE FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS TO IT CONCERNS RELATED TO WHETHER YOU'RE PROPOSAL ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES. THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. IN THE AUDIT. AND AT THAT I THINK MANY FOLKS IN THE LEGISLATURE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AN OF WE DO NOT HAVE. THE COMPLAINT PROCESS. THAT HAS INTEGRITY AS WELL HOW SIMPLY I WOULD PUT IT. SO -- OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M RE WESLEY I'M THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY -- WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT'S PLAN THAT WAS -- PROVIDED TO YOU. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACCEPTED OUR MAIN RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO REMOVE THE INQUIRY PROCESS FROM THE INSTITUTION. AND REGIONAL LIES THE PROCESS UNDER DIFFERENT CHAIN OF COMMAND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- UNDER THISPLAN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING THE INCREASE. THEY'VE ALSO ADOPTED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO CONDUCT THE INQUIRIES -- WE FELT THAT -- THE MOTHER WITH THE TRAINING AT THE INSTITUTION WAS NON EXISTENT IN CONDUCTING THE INCREASE WE RECOMMENDED. SOME POST CERTIFIED TRAINING AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACCEPTED THAT -- I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER A RECOMMENDATION FOR AUDIO RECORDING. OF ALL THE INTERVIEWS THAT ARE DONE IN THIS PROCESS. WE OBSERVE THAT NONE OF THE INCREASE. WERE THE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED SO ABSENT US BEING THERE NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE INTERVIEWS -- WE FOUND. A LOT OF IRREGULARITIES AND HOW THE INTERVIEWS WERE DONE AND AGAIN IF WE HADN'T BEEN THERE. NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN. OF THE PROPOSAL IS SET FORTH BY THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FOR NO INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF CRITICAL DECISIONS. BY THE INSTITUTION HIRING AUTHORITY OR BY THE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I BELIEVE INDEPENDENT TRANSPARENT EXTERNALOVERSIGHT OF ALL EXPENSE OF THE PROCESS. IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE FAITH IN THE CHANGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS MAKING. APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND POLICIES WILL ALSO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW PROCESS WE HAVE NOT. BEEN ENGAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT YET ON THEIR PLANS FOR THOSE IMPLEMENTING. POLICIES AND REGULATIONS -- I BELIEVE THAT THE POP THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO SEE HOW THIS IS ROLLED OUT FOR IMPLEMENTATION THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO SEE IF THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ARE FAITHFUL. TO THE SOLUTIONS. OUR OUR FAITHFUL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE IDENTIFIED. I WOULD NOTE THAT AT THIS POINT WITH REGARD TO THE STAFF COMPLAIN PROCESS. THE AG HAS NO FURTHER STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT -- WE CONTINUE TO WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THE DEPARTMENT REAL. LEADERSHIP REGARDING THE PROCESS IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD. AS THIS POSTAL GOES FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTS. SO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT YOU RAISED WERE. DEFINITELY RAISED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. ABOUT AN THE LACK OF THE INDEPENDENCE THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. THE THERE WERE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SIR -- INSPECTOR GENERAL YOU JUST REFERENCE THAT THE OFFICE HAS NO STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT. DID THE OFFICE IN THE PAST HAVE SUCH STATUTORY AUTHORITY YES -- PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN OUR OFFICE HAD DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO AUDIT OR MONITOR ANY ISSUES THAT. THAT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT WE THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT BUT WAS THE COMPLAINT PROCESS THE SAME AT THAT POINT WE SO WAS IT A SIMILAR COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH INTERNALLY. TO A C. C. R. BUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OFFICE COULD JUST INVOLVE ITSELF. IF IT CAME TO THEIR IF THERE SEEM TO BE A WHATEVER PROBLEM OR A IN ORDER THE WORD TO USE BUT YEAH YES -- DO WE HAVE HAD. AS YOU KNOW OUR STATURE REQUIRES US TO TO HAVE A A METHOD FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMPLAIN. SINCE I COMPLAIN. OKAY SO OVER THE YEARS WE HAD GOTTEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND OUR RECOURSE WAS SIMPLY TO TELL THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE THIS COMPLAINT YOU GUYS ARE TAKE A LOOK AT IT WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO BUT IN THE PAST YOU COULD HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WHEN WE GOT THOSE COMPLAINTS WE COULD HAVE LOOKED AT THEM -- PRIOR -- TO STATUE CHANGE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SO LET SOME. JUST FOR HYPOTHETICAL SAKE. LET'S SEE -- WELL LET'S GO BACK TO THAT PASSED. EVEN WITHOUT AUTHORITY. DO YOU FEEL THAT THE SO EVEN IF THAT OF THE WORD EXISTED. IS THE COMPLAINT PROCESS CHANGES THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED NOW -- ADEQUATE JUST. FOR A COMPLETE PROCESS SEPARATE FROM. THE ABILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY TO ALSO -- INTERVENE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS IN. IN FIXING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. STRUCTURALLY I DO I HAVE SOME -- AND WE DISCUSSED WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WITH. THEIR SPECIAL GRIEVANCES VERSUS THERE ARE STAFF COMPLAIN GRIEVANCES. BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OVERLAP THAT -- AGAIN I THINK I NEED TO SEE HOW THEY IMPLEMENT. THEIR SOLUTION BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT. THESE SPECIAL GRIEVANCES WOULD BE CARVED OUT WHEN THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY STAFF MISCONDUCT THERE JUST OF A DIFFERENT ILK THERE -- THE THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT KINDS OF COMPLAINTS OR THE USE OF FORCE -- COMPLAINTS WHERE -- WERE WERE PRISONER WOULD.% WOULD COMPLAIN THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF UNNECESSARY OR UNREASONABLE FORCE. IN A CAR THOSE OUT FROM OTHER STAFF MISCONDUCT SUCH AS HE WAS DISCOURTEOUS TO ME OR IN A PROPERLY SEARCH MYSELF I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN IT IT'S STAFF BEHAVIOR. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES THE STAFF BEHAVIOR HOMOGENEOUS LEE. HER -- SO MY QUESTION CAESAR'S JUST WHETHER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF THESE PROPOSED CHANGES FOR THE STAFF COMPLAINT -- WAS THE DID YOU -- WAS EITHER THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL INVOLVED OR ASKED TO REVIEW. I THINK -- JOE AND I ARE UNAWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TAKE PLACE I'VE I HAVE HEARD THEY DID TAKE PLACE BUT WE WERE NOT INVOLVED ARE PART PROPOSAL ITSELF WAS MEANT TO BE SORT OF A TO TO PUT A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN. IN TRYING -- TO MEET THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT ITSELF [inaudible] OKAY OKAY -- CENTER MORE LIKE DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS. I'M LOOKING AT MY TRUSTEE IPHONE I'M NOT FINDING THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SO I APOLOGIZE IF I IF I MEAN IS ARE A MY APOLOGIES I USE THE STATE ORDER BECAUSE I'M STUCK ON THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT. THE STATE AUDITOR DID THE AUDIT ON THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IT IS THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. THEY DID THE REPORT ON THE COMPLAINT PROGRAM SO THAT WAS Y HERE. I GET TOO MANY REPORTS IN AGENCIES IN MY FOREHEAD. BUT VERY GOOD QUESTION -- CATION BECAUSE WE REALLY APPRECIATE IS ARE LIKE WHAT IS SKINNER TALKING ABOUT YEAH SHE WAS -- OFF OKAY. BUT THERE IS A REPORT BROUGHT COPIES IF YOU'D LIKE A COPY OF THE REPORT GREAT OKAY. SO WHY SHOULD TELL ME. MISTER WESLEY -- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OFFICE WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR LEAST MORE THAN A DECADE -- YES SO OUR OFFICE WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND IT WAS A SUB DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS -- THE DUTIES WERE TO PERFORM SOME AUDITS OF REVIEW POLICY AND PERFORM -- MANAGEMENT REVIEW AUDITS. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AS A RESULT OF SOME LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS REGARDING CONCERNS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS MOVED OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND WAS MADE AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY. WITH JURISDICTION FOR OVERSIGHT. OF THE DEPARTMENT. AT THAT TIME. A IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS GIVEN DISCRETION TO CONDUCT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WAS THAT -- THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT THE SECRETARY. WOULD EXERT UNDUE INFLUENCE ON THE OFFICE. AND NOT ALLOW CERTAIN ARTISTS ARE INVESTIGATIONS TO GO FORWARD. SO WE WERE GIVEN -- DISCRETION TO DO THOSE AUDITS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL COURT IN MADRID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT -- THE O. I. G.'S JURISDICTION WAS EXPANDED. TO INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINE PROCESS -- THAT. THAT STATUTORY SCHEME REMAINED IN EFFECT UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN. THERE WAS LEGISLATION WHICH RESTRUCTURED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE AGENCY THE ORGY BUDGET WAS CUT BY 45%. AND OUR STAFFING WAS ALSO REDUCED BY ABOUT HALF. OF OUR DISCRETION TO CONDUCT AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS WAS ELIMINATED AND OUR STATUTORY DUTIES WERE REALLY REDUCED TO A DELINEATED LIST. OF FUNCTIONS WHICH INCLUDED. A STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR INSPECTIONS OF THE PRISON MEDICAL SYSTEM. WE NOW ONLY PERFORM THE DUTIES DESCRIBED. IN THE STATUTE AND I DO HAVE A HANDOUT FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE -- FOR THAT'S A SHORT. OF WHAT WE DO AND IT HAS OUR DUTIES -- LAID OUT FOR YOU SO YOU WERE YOUR EMBEDDED BUT INDEPENDENT. WE ARE NOT EMBEDDED SO I DO NOT REPORT TO THE SECRETARY FOR EXAMPLE OKAY -- I'M IT WANTED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR AN INDEPENDENT SIX YEAR TERM THAT IS. CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE -- AND I CAN BE REMOVED FOR CAUSE BUT BUT THAT'S IT -- THE I'M COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT. OF THE DEPARTMENT AND IN FACT INDEPENDENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE KIND OF LIKE THE LOOK OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WHERE AN ORPHAN. SO DON'T REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND ALL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE DON'T REPORT TO THE COURTS -- WE HAVE THIS KIND OF A UNIQUE PROCESS WHERE WE ENGAGE WITH ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS. BUT BUT THERE'S NO REPORTING RELATIONSHIP. AND YOUR SCOPE IS RATHER NARROW NOW IT IS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] YOUR FOCUS IS TO TRY AND CORRECTING CENTER [inaudible] NOT [inaudible] FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. AS WRITE A REPORT AND OF COURSE YOU GAVE ME A NICE THICK REPORTS SIDE. OF TRYING TO READ IT. ON THE FLIGHTTHE OTHER THE OTHER DOCUMENT I GAVE YOU IS A IS A SUMMARY OF THE REPORT SO IT'S IT'S LIKE HIGHLIGHT. OF YOUR QUE GOT IT -- AND THIS IS SORT OF ROCKER QUESTION BUT AND BEING OTHER MYSELF FOR ME WOULD YOU. WHO WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW? DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING FULFILLED AND AND AND THAT YOU'RE. PROVIDING A SERVICE THAT'S BENEFICIAL O THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE WELL I THINK FOR THOSE DELINEATED -- ISSUES THAT WERE THAT WE ARE THAT WE HAVE JURISDICTION I THINK WE DO WE PROVIDE -- WE PROVIDED A GOOD SERVICE I THINK -- WE PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY -- WHAT GETS LOST HIS THOSE ISSUES THAT ARISE WHERE THEY DON'T FALL WITHIN OUR DELINEATED STATUTORY AUTHORITY SO FOR EXAMPLE -- AS I NOTED BEFORE WE HAVE OUR STATURE REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN. A EIGHT HUNDRED OF PHONE LINE AND A WEBSITE IN WAYS FOR THE PUBLIC AND INMATES TO CONTACT US -- IF THEY HAVE COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS A MONTH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE. ARE NOT WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION TO REALLY GO DO ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH THOSE IS -- FIRST OF ALL WE TELL INMATES OF THEY HAVE COMPLAINTS. AND THEY HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT YOU NEED TO DO THAT FIRST BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WE CAN DO UNLESS THERE'S A FINAL DECISION. SECONDLY IF THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND WE STILL THINK THERE IS AN ISSUE. THAT I CAN GOING GAUGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SAY LOOK WE GOT THIS THIS IS NOT RIGHT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND THEY CAN TELL US -- YEAH WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT OR THEY TOLD US IN THE PAST -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT AND YOUR SCOPE IS BEEN NARROW YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN REDUCED. YOU'RE STILL PROVIDING. THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES BASED ON YOUR MANDATE -- AND I I WOULD ASSUME THEN THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO EXPAND YOUR SCOPE BECAUSE THAT WOULD REQUIRE ASKING FOR MORE EMPLOYEES. BEFORE SCOPE WERE EXPANDED I WOULD NEED MORE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK -- WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CALLS THAT YOU GET THAT? YOU CAN'T ADDRESS THAT GOES. TO WELL WE RIGHT BACK WE FIRST OF ALL WE ANSWER EVERYONE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS WE GOT. AND WHEN WE GET TO AN IMPASSE WHERE THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER WE CAN DO WE SUGGEST TO THEM THAT THEY CONTACT THEIR THERE LEGISLATORS -- THAT THEY CONTACT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- WE RECOMMEND IS A LEGISLATOR DO HELP ME OUT BEFORE THEY CALL. WELL I GET THE I. THEM THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. AND IT'S HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES I GET A CALL FROM THE LEGISLATORS OFFICE STAFFER USUALLY. WHO SAYS HEY WE GOT THIS CONSTITUENT COMPLAINT WHAT'S GOING ON I LET THEM KNOW? AND THEN THEY CAN ENGAGE THE DEPARTMENT THEY CAN. THEY CAN DO THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO -- AND IT'S REALLY OUT OF MY IT'S OUT OF MY PURVIEW AT THAT POINT IF SO THEN HAVE YOU SENSE THE NEED THAT YOU NEED TO EXPAND YOUR SCOPE AND NEED MORE STAFFING AND HAVE YOU EVER APPROACH TO LEGISLATOR TO TRY AND PURSUE THAT IN A BUDGET BILL OR WE HAVE. HAD DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST -- THERE WAS NOT. OF AN APPETITE TO DO THAT -- I THINK THE LAST TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH MY PREDECESSOR OF BACK IN THERE WAS AN ISSUE AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON THE US SENATE PRO TEM. REQUESTED. UNDER OUR STATUTE THEY CAN REQUEST US TO GO LOOK AT SOMETHING THEY REQUESTED US. TO REPORT. THERE WERE -- THINKS THAT WE FOUND -- AND THE DEPARTMENT WAS RESPONSIVE AND WE NOTED THAT -- IT WOULD BE NICE AND WE TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE. TO TAKE THAT ACTION BEFORE IT GOT TO THE LEVEL OF THE THIS THE SENATE -- BUT AT THAT POINT THERE WAS REALLY NO APPETITE. TO DO THAT AND WE WHERE A CREATURE OF OUR STATUTE SO WE DO WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO SO WHERE IS YOUR VETTING. STAGE THE STATE AUDITOR GETS. TO PRESENT IN FRONT OF WHAT WE CALL J. LACK THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE. AUDIT COMMITTEE DO YOU HAVE A SIMILAR. THE SO THEN YOU JUST PREPARE REPORT AND WHERE DOES IT GO. WELL WE SO WHEN WE REQUESTED. TWO OF TO DO A REVIEW IT'S CALLED WE PREPARE THE REPORT AND WE PROVIDE IT TO THE TO THE ENTITY THAT HAS REQUESTED. THE THE REVIEW AND THEN WE POSTED IT'S A PUBLIC REPORT SO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IS PUBLIC SO WE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. AND WE CAN ENGAGE WE WE DO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS SO -- THE DEPARTMENT OF COURSE HAS LOTS OF CONTACT WE HAVE ONGOING CONTACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE ONGOING CONTACT WITH THE PRISON LAW OFFICE THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE -- THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE OF ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT DEAL IN THE ISSUES THAT WE LOOK AT WE WE STAY ENGAGED THE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT. WE ARE MORE REACTIVE THAN WE ARE A PROACTIVE SO -- IF -- IF I SAW SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT. WAS REALLY SERIOUS AND NEED TO BE LOOKED AT I WOULD GO TO THE SENATE PRO TEM'S OFFICE OR THE SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY OR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. OF BUT OFTEN TIMES THE ISSUES THE BUBBLE UP. OUR OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW THE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE VISIBILITY ON THEM BECAUSE OF I DON'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO EVEN LOOK AT HAV YOU LOOK BACK. ON YOUR REVIEWS AND QUANTIFIED THEM THAT THE FOLLOWING. REPORTS RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING. MODIFICATIONS CHANGES OR WHATEVER TO MANAGEMENT OR TO POLICIES PROCEDURES WHICH GENERATED A COST SAVINGS OF AXE. WE DO THAT -- ONE OF OUR MANDATES IS TO YEARLY TO AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT SUMMARIZES. THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND IN THE PAST YEAR AND PROVIDE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION -- I THINK MY PREDECESSOR GONE AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE BIT -- BUT WE HAVE. OF WE RE DEDICATED TO THAT AND WE JUST PUBLISHED IN FACT OUR OF IN A REPORT WHICH TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS YEAR. ARE YOU SAVING THE STATE MULTIPLES OF YOUR DEPARTMENT COSTS BY BELIEVE SO YES SO. I THINK  IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID THIS REPORT. WAS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PRISON LAW OFFICE HAD COME THE LAGER LAGERS HEADS OVER -- THIS STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND I WAS INVITED INTO A CONVERSATION WITH -- THE SECRETARY TO TIMES COCHRAN AND DON SPECTER OF THE PLO THEY WERE MEETING THEY ASKED ME TO COME OVER. AND DON WAS. GETTING READY TO FILE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON THE APPEALS PROCESS. AND SCOTT ASKED ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT WOULD WE BE WILLING IF THEY INVITED US IN BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY JURISDICTION TO DO THAT WOULD WE BE WILLING TO GO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND GIVE THE DEPARTMENT AN INDEPENDENT LOOK AT WHAT WAS GOING ON SO. WE AGREED TO DO THAT. I THINK AS A RESULT OF THAT PLO BACKED OFF OF THEIR PLANNED LAWSUIT AND JUST IN THAT ONE INSTANCE ALONE. THE ATTORNEYS FEES PROBABLY EXCEED WHAT OUR BUDGET IS. SO THEN -- IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SECRETARY AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP. IF I WERE THE SECRETARY. YOU BE LIKE A MANAGEMENT. TOOL I COULD USE THAT TERM SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO HELP ME MAKE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER WHY WHY ISN'T THERE. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT WE HAVE A BAD RELATIONSHIP PARTED SAY THAT I I WOULD SAY IF I WERE I'D. I'D BE WORKING WITH YOU TO SAY HEY WOOD. WE WERE CAN I WORK AND I DIRECT USE SO THAT I CAN IMPROVE MY DEPARTMENT. WE MEET. ONCE A MONTH REGULARLY AND THEN AND THEN I ALSO HAVE PROBABLY WEEKLY PHONE CALLS WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT THEIR FOCUS IS NOT ON HAVING US DO THINGS BUT MORE -- ARE YOU SEEING THINGS GOING TO GET US IN TROUBLE. AND AND SO SOME THINGS WE CAN HELP HIM OUT WITH SOME THINGS WE CAN'T. AND AND SO MADAM CHAIR -- WE HAD THE JOY OF BUT WHEN I BECAME A SUPERVISOR FOR THE COUNTY WE HAD -- JUST SOME ISSUES AT THE JAIL I MEAN I WALKED IN THE LAWSUIT CLOSE SESSION I WALKED INTO A AN INMATE THAT WAS MURDERED BY INMATES WILD. SH THE DEPUTIES JUST SORT OF WATCH TV AND YOU KNOW WAS. IT WAS REALLY A GREAT EXPERIENCE NOT -- BUT WE DEVELOPED AN OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OR EUROPE NATIONALS ARE KIND OF CLOSE. WE WERE MODELED AFTER THE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW IN LOS ANGELES CHAIR WITH MICHAEL G. WITH WITH MICHEL CHEN ARE GOING CHEN OCTOBER YEAH SO WE HAD THE SAME. SORT OF APPROACH. THEIR ORIGINAL MODEL BEFORE WE STRIPPED THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL MODEL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE STRIPPED MUCH THE AUTHORITY OF THE IT OKAY. THANKS SO I I'M I'M LEARNING BUT I'VE GOT SOME. HISTORICAL CONTEXT THE DOCTOR TO WORK WITH. THE INDIVIDUAL WE HIRED SUPER I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH HIM -- BUT SINCE I'VE LEFT -- SOME THINGS CAME UP THAT WERE DISCOVERED. THAT SOMEHOW THE O. I. R. HADN'T DISCOVERED FIRST AND SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOUR SECRETARY IS SAYING. HAVE YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT WOULD CAUSE NONE OF US LIKE SURPRISES RECORD SO SO YOU'RE SORT OF LIKE THAT. SINCE YOU KNOW FRONT LINE SAY OKAY YOU IDENTIFY LET'S GET IN FRONT OF IT BEFORE IT HAPPENS SO -- APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS MISTER WESLEY IN. I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IF THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO. TO ASSIST YOU TO MAKE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD BEGIN SPITTLE DIME TO MAKE A QUARTERS MY MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS SAY. SO I CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE IN THAT REGARD PLEASE LET ME KNOW THANK YOU AND WE'RE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR YOU'D LIKE FURTHER BRIEFING FROM US WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME OVER AND AND AND PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU. WELL I JUST PAUL JR IS A THIS IS A MASSIVELY BIG STATE AND I'M. HERE FOR MY FOURTH YEAR AND I'M STILL LEARNING EVERY DAY WHICH IS ON WHICH IS GREAT BUT IT'S KIND OF SCARY TO THE LEARNING CURVE JUST KEEPS. GOING SO FORGIVE ME FOR NOT KNOWING EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK A LOT OF THESE. BASIC QUESTION -- I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU M. SENATOR AND THEY THEY WERE VERY GOOD QUESTIONS AND WHEN I AND APOLOGIES TO EVERYONE THAT I CITED THEIR OWN REPORT BUT I READ THIS REPORT. IN IN READING IT SO I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE NOT WIN IN THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS ESTABLISHED BUT IN. TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN THE TOWERS WERE MODIFIED. AND AT THAT POINT. I WAS IN ON BUDGET COMMITTEE N. ARE PROBABLY DIDN'T ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS AS TO YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE DOING SO AND TO WHAT BENEFIT THAT WOULD. AND IN THE YEARS PAST. AS I HAVE. IF WE THINK ABOUT THE AUDITOR. DID THE STATE AND THE O. I. G. EIGHT WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED FOR SEMI SIMILAR PURPOSES NOT EXACTLY THE SAME. BUT SEMI SIMILAR. ORIGINALLY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAD SOME COMPARABLE AUTHORITIES TO THE STATE AUDITOR IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE. TO GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION. YOU KNOW WE WE EXPECT TERM. WE DON'T EXPECT IT'S EVEN IN OUR STATUTE THAT IF THE STATE AUDITOR'S AUDITING YOU YOU GOT TURN EVERYTHING OVER. AND NOW. IT'S NOT MY I SHOULD SAY MY IMPRESSION IS THAT OUR OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. BUT IF WE THINK THAT THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS TO GIVE TO CREATE AN ENTITY THAT REALLY HAD THE IN. INDEPENDENCE TO DO THAT KIND OF REVIEW FOR US BECAUSE WE WERE. JUST LIKE WHY WE HAVE A STATE AUDITOR. IS NONE OF US ARE PERFECT AND IT ISN'T EVEN AN ASSUMPTION THAT ANY AGENCY IS TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING IT'S MORE THAT. WE WE BECOME PART OF THE CULTURE OF OUR OF OUR OPERATIONS IN IT'S SOMETIMES HARDER FOR US TO SEE WHEN THERE ARE FLAWS. AND SO FOR ME WHEN I READ THIS REPORT. I THUGHT WHOA. THIS THE NOT JUST THAT SOME OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS SEES WERE REALLY IN ADEQUATE. BUT THAT. WE DO WE NO LONGER HAD A SITUATION. WHERE OUR OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL? COULD GET THE INFORMATION HAT IT NEEDED. OR COMPEL CERTAIN TYPE OF CHANGES AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD REVISIT THAT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT IT NOWTHE BCP BEFORE US. DOES NOT INCLUDE RESTORING SOME OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE ORIGINALLY HAD BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE ORIGINAL STATUTE INCLUDED A MANDATE. THAT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD INDEPENDENTLY CAN CHECK NOT QUITE IN FAMILIES STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME APPROVAL BUT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. AND WAS OUR REQUIREMENT THAT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL CONDUCT FACILITY OPERATION REVIEWS SO THERE WERE VERY S. BUT THE WARRANTIES THAT THE OFFICE USED TO HAVE. IN BY BEING THAT IT WOULD BE VERY WELL WORTH OUR WHILE. TO CONSIDER WHICH ONES WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF TO RESTORE. SO THAT WE HAVE THE TYPE OF INDEPENDENCE. THAT WE WOULD WANT. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN. IN -- IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M RECOMMENDING THAT WE HOLD THE ITEM OPEN SO THAT WE CAN TALK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. THOSE POSSIBILITIES. AND ALSO SO WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL TWEAKING TO THE RECOMMENDED -- COMPLAINT REVIEW CHANGES OUR COMPLAINT PROCESS CHANGES. IN THERE ARE I DID SEE THAT THERE DEFINITELY IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF WHAT CDC ARE IS RECOMMENDING -- BUT I'VE. BUT INDEPENDENTLY I HAD NOTED. THAT THERE WERE. IN THE FLOW CHART. THE ISSUE OF SEPARATE PROCESS SEES FOR SPECIAL GRIEVANCES. SEEM -- TO I WASN'T SURE REALLY THE BENEFIT OF THAT. AND THERE WERE JUST SOME QUESTIONS LIKE THAT WHICH BEFORE I'D EVEN ASK THEM. THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL RAISE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SO I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE MORE AND ALSO LOOK AT WHETHER WE WANT. TO RESTORE A FEW OF THESE -- MANDATES THAT WERE IN THE ORIGINAL STATUTE [inaudible] LA OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE DO HAVE COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL -- KAELIN O'NEILL AT THE LA OKAY AT WE WE RAISE TWO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT'S BEING REQUESTED. AND WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE WORKLOAD FOR PRISON BASED STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY TASKED WITH. DOING ENQUIRIES INTO STAFF COMPLAINTS AND BY SHIFTING THAT WORKLOAD TO THESE NEW REGIONAL TEAMS UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE TURN INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- THE PROPOSAL WOULD -- WORK AT REDUCE AS I SAID WORKLOAD FOR THOSE PRISON MAY STAFF AND WHAT WE THINK WHEN I SHOP IN THE FORM OF REDUCED. OVERTIME SPENDING AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE -- REDUCE THE REQUESTED FUNDING AMOUNT AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLE SAVINGS AMOUNT. OUR SECOND AREA OF CONCERN WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TO SOME DEGREE IS THE LACK OF DETAIL ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. OF THE NEW INCREASE PROCESS AND OUR AIR OUR CONCERNS FELL INTO THREE AREAS EXPERTISE INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY. ON THE ISSUE OF EXPERT EXPERTISE. THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PROVIDED OVER THIS PROCESS. AND DOES THE ENTITY OR ENTITIES BEING TASKED WITH THAT HAVE THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT -- FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF AUDIT AND AUDITS IN COURT COMPLIANCE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE NEW PROCESS. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT OVERSIGHT WOULD TAKE THE FORM PRIMARILY OF DATA ANALYTICS WHICH THE STAFF IN THAT OFFICE MAY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE HOWEVER GAINES. AYE THOSE DUTIES WERE ASSIGNED TO A GENERAL -- SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION KIND OF AS AND OTHER DUTIES ASSIGNED THERE WEREN'T SPECIFIC TEAM SET OUT FOR THIS. SO THE CHANGES IN REDUCTION ON THE IT'LL INSTITUTIONS THAT WOULD LIKELY BE VERY MARGINAL AND IT'S AN AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL NOTED A LOT OF THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE HANDLED IN ADEQUATELY ANSWERED. IDENTIFYING A TIMER SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING THOSE COMPLAINTS OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. ON THAT ONE NIGHT I CAN IN. SO IN GENERAL I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SAVINGS SAVINGS IN THE WAYS TO ABSORB BUT I CAN IMAGINE IF WE IF WE WANT AN IMPROVED. COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH -- I MEAN NOW WE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPLAINTS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED. BY IT AS STAFF MEMBER WHO. WHO REPORTED TO THE PERSON WHO? HAD IT WOULD THE COMPLAINT WAS ISSUED AGAINST I MEAN WHAT KIND OF THAT IS. TO MEAN THAT JUST. DOES NOT WORK SO. BY THE BY CAN SEE WHERE THERE MAY BE RESOURCES REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A AN APPROPRIATE COMPLAINT PROCESS BUT I CERTAINLY THINK SOME OF THE OTHER. ISSUES THAT ELIO RACED -- ARE HAVE MERIT. I'M CENTER MORE LOCKED. THANK YOU SURE I I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH THE ORG CHART MR. GALVIN WHAT IS YOUR TITLE AGAIN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. SO I I DON'T SEE IN MY MATERIAL AT AN OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS I SEE AN OFFICE OF AUDITS IN COURT COMPLIANCE I SEE A DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS -- I SEE AN OFFICE OF APPEALS I SEE AN A DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH. AND INTERNAL OVERSIGHT -- MY MEDICINE SO WE FALL UNDER THAT THE VISION OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT. WITHIN THAT DIVISION OUR PROGRAMS ARE THE OFFICE OF THE FEELS THE ALSO THE POLICY COR COMPLIANCE. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH. OKAY AND SO HOW DOES THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FIT INTO THAT ORG CHART OR DOES IT NOT. SO THEY ARE SEPARATE AGENCY HOWEVER -- WHEN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OPENS INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY GET INVESTING A REQUEST? THE AG IS INVOLVED IN THAT PROP PROCESS. ESSENTIALLY THE TERM ISSUES FOR QUICK OF A GRAVE SO THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THE REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATIONS. THEY CAN THEY PROVIDE -- RECOMMENDATIONS INPUT TO OUR OUR UNITS NAY AND BAD. THE ATTORNEYS WITH OUR INVESTIGATIVETEAMS ON INVESTIGATIONS THE MEET THE CRITERIA THAT THEY SET AND I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO GRASP THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION A REVIEW HERE SO -- ARE WE STATING THAT THERE'S MAYBE [inaudible] DUPLICATION OR ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THAT THE QUESTION THE CONCERN WE RAISE ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT AROUND THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS. YOU MENTIONED THREE RECORD. SURE AND I ONLY HAVE -- TWO WRITTEN MATERIAL SO. SIR THERE ARE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT FLOW FROM TWO CONCERNS THE SEPARATE SIDE OF SEPARATE CAN THE SECOND EXCUSE ME SECOND CONCERN. ABOUT OVERSIGHT HAD THREE AREAS WITHIN IT. THAT WE FELT. IT LACKED DETAIL -- IN THE PROPOSAL EXPERTISE INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY. I'D HAVE I'D BE HAPPY TO REVIEW ANY OF THAT IF YOU'D LIKE OFTEN DO YOU AGREE WITH HER OVER SAID HER READ HER OBSERVATIONS RECOMMENDATION WELL SO. WHEN IT WHEN WHEN A COMPLAINT RISES TO AN OPEN FULL INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION THE -- AG CAN ATTACH THEMSELVES THEY THEY HAVE OVERSIGHT WITH OUR INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. THE INQUIRY PROCESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SORT OF A PRE FORMAL INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. IT HAPPENS AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL NOW. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT SHE'D ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND GRIEVANCES LAST YEAR NOT THAT ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND OUR STAFF FOR SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND OR STAFF COMPLAINING CORY'S SO THAT ISN'T THAT IS A CONDITIONAL INQUIRY TO DETERMINE. IF THERE'S ENOUGH TO REQUEST A FORMAL INVESTIGATION FOR FOR CAN ANSWER THE ISSUES IN THE GRIEVANCE AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY THE WARDENS -- TO MAKE A DECISION REGARDING THE COMPLAINTS. AND SO MISTER WESLEY. HOW DID YOU HAVE A LIKE A RESPONSE TO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS? WELL THE I CAN'T ADDRESS THE DOLLAR. PEACE OF MIND WE HI I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE OUR OFFICE FINANCE THE OF THESE. THESE INCREASE THAT HAD THAT WE WENT AND LOOKED AT WORK AD HOC. THEY WERE THEY JUST GRAB SOMEBODY OFF THE YARD AND SAID YOU NEED I NEED THIS DONE IN THIRTY DAYS. SO THERE WAS NO TIME KEEPING THERE WAS NO -- NO REFERENCE. TO OF HOW MUCH EFFORT WAS PUT INTO IT -- AND AS THEY SAID THEY WERE DONE SO POORLY THAT I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE OF MUCH VALUE ON GIVING YOU SOME IDEA OF HOW LONG THEY TAKE OR HOW MUCH MANPOWER THEY TAKE [inaudible] ARE THESE. COMPLAIN THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE THEY NOW SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST ACT OF BASED ON THE BILL THAT SENATOR SKINNER HAD APPROVED LAST YEAR. NO NO -- BECAUSE I DON'T DEAL WITH THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER HAS THE SENATORS BILL OKAY IF THEY WERE. THE UNDER VARIOUS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A COMPLAINT COULD [inaudible] BUT IT. IT WOULD BE RARE. IN TERMS OF THE NARROWNESS OF SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT THE COMPLAINTS DEAL WITH STAFFING. BIG WOULD SUSPECT RIGHT THEY DEAL WITH THINGS SUCH AS THIS OFFICER -- SEARCH MY CELL AND TOOK MY PERSONAL PROPERTY. AND FOR NO REASON. OR THIS OFFICER WAS -- DISCOURTEOUS TO ME CALLED ME NAMES YOU KNOW THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT'S A LOT OF THOSE COMPLAINTS. A LOT OF ROOM A LOT OF THOSE COMPLAINTS OF A LARGE NUMBER THOSE COMPLAINTS IN FACT OUR USE OF FORCE RELATED SO. NGUYEN FORCES USED WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM -- THE INMATE HAS THE HAS THE RIGHT. TO A RACE AN ISSUE AS TO WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE. AND THAT'S DONE. BY THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS BUT IT'S SORT OF INTERMINGLED WITH THE USE OF FORCE REVIEW PROCESS -- SO THERE'S A FAIR NUMBER OF THOSE -- THESE OUR TYPICALLY ISSUES THAT -- IT MAKES REYES BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED PROPERLY [inaudible] SO. A DOZEN YEARS AGO HOW MANY LAWSUITS WERE FILED BY. INMATES. THE TO THE STATE. FOR ISSUES LIKE THIS AND ASKED FOR MONETARY DAMAGES. I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT I KNOW THAT THOSE LAWSUITS CONTINUE TO TODAY -- I WAS SEEING A DECLINE DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE SO A REMINDER DURING A BILL [inaudible] BY NOT. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AT CORRECTIONS -- PROVIDES OVERSIGHT TO THEY'RE THE ONES WHO. DEFENDED APARTMENT ON THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN THAT'S OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION. FOR MONITORING THE DEPARTMENT. BUT WOULD IT BE. A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SAVE BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE WORKING TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS IN A HOPEFULLY I'M A PROPER MANNER PROFESSIONAL MANNER THAT WE WON'T HAVE LAWSUITS AND HERE'S HOW MUCH WE'VE SAVED BECAUSE WE HAD. YOU KNOW HUNDRED LAWSUITS IN YEAR ONE AND WE'RE DOWN TO TEN IN YEAR TEN I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT'S THAT WOULD BE A A BENEFIT OF PROVIDING OVERSIGHT TO THIS PROCESS [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU MANAGER I'M. I'M GLAD THIS IS OPEN AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME MORE. TO REAL TO REVIEW AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WE'RE HOLDING IT OPEN FOR APPRECIATE ALL OF DISCUSSION MANNER -- INPUT BOTH FROM THE DEPARTMENT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL OF COURSE LA -- AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- SKEWS ME PUBLIC COMMENT SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE PENAL CODE REVIEW. AND FOSTER CALLUM FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES FOR THINNING ON THAT -- COULDN'T COME TO PERMANENT FINANCE I'M REPRESENTING THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE PENAL CODE REVIEW COMMITTEE PROPOSAL. AND THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN SIZE FROM ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WORDS IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO ONE POINT TWO MILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GOING TO GET WORSE KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY COULD A FIFTY BILLS BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND SEPARATE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS SPECIFYING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR PENALTIES FOR CONVICTIONS ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS AND CREDIT EARNING ONCE INCARCERATED. CONSEQUENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A NEW COMMITTEE. WILL BE ESTABLISHED UNDER THE LAW REVISION COMMISSION TO STUDY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REVISE THIS COMPLEX STATUTORY STRUCTURE. THE NEW COMMITTEE WILL HAVE SEPARATE POWERS TO MAKE POLICIES AND TAKE THAT ACTION SEPARATE FROM THE COMMISSION INTERVIEW LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ON REVISIONS TO THE PENAL CODE. THE COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN AN EFFORT TO SIMPLIFY AND RATIONALIZE CRIMINAL LONG CRIMINAL PROCEDURES ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION THAT AID REHABILITATION AND PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. IMPROVE PAROLE AND PROBATION SYSTEMS AND ADJUST THE LENGTH OF SENDS BASED ON CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING FOR TWO ATTORNEY POSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION ASSOCIATED COST WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THE COMMITTEE. AND THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR US TO READ REPORTS LET ALONE THE ANYWAY -- A I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REVIEWING THAT IN CREATING AN ENTITY TO PREVIEW IT MY ONE ISSUE WOULD BE THE COMPOSITION YOU RECOMMEND OR RATHER THE PROPOSAL. SAYS ONE SENATE MEMBER ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND FIVE APPOINTEES FROM THE GOVERNOR. A COURSE -- AS LEGISLATORS -- YOU KNOW THAT THE A LITTLE BIT S. Q. -- BUT CAN A JUSTIFICATION BESIDES THAT YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE IT S. Q.. I I SEE IT WOULD REALLY THE-COMMITTEES MODELED ON A SMALLER SCALE AFTER THE EXISTING LAW REVISION COMMISSION WHICH IS ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE SENATOR AND SEVEN GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE IS. OUT OF THE VOTE ON THAT -- IT'S MODELED AFTER THAT -- I DO THINK THAT HAVING AN ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE MEMBER ON THE COMMITTEE VERSUS JUST AN APPOINTEE FROM EACH OF THE HOUSES PROBABLY OR OR PROVIDES A LEVEL OF ELEVATION OR SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT POSITION THAT JUST A REGULAR APPOINTEE DOESN'T YOU KNOW HOW. WE ARE DOING VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT ALLOWED THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE SEVEN INTO SOLELY TO BUT SENATOR MOORLACH. MADAM CHAIR -- HI I'M. I GET ONE INTERVIEW REVIEW EVERYTHING -- BUT THIS. I GUESS A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS IS THAT MEAN THAT THIS COMMITTEE COMES ROCKER COMMISSION COMES BACK AND SAYS HERE'S ALL THE MODIFICATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE TO THE PENAL CODE WE GET THIS MASSIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR BILLS AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. YEAH I DON'T HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXISTING PROCESS BUT YES GENERALLY WE WOULD WE THE COMMITTEE WOULD COME BACK WITH A RECOMMENDATION. AND THEN ITWOULD BE UPON THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER TO TAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS UP AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY WOULD WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE CAME AND AND AND PAY FOR ALL THAT NGUYEN MAYBE IT COULD BE DONE BY. PRIVATE SECTOR THINK TANK OR THE JUDICIARY DID JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR OR SOMEONE ELSE IF THERE IS YOU KNOW WHY WHY ARE WE TAKING IT UPON OURSELVES. I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT -- THE COMMISSION EXIST TODAY AND THEY TùTAKE A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR STATUTORY STRUCTURE. THEY'RE NOT REALLY SET UP IN A WAY TO LOOK AT THE PENAL CODE. AND SO WE THINK JUST ADDING RESOURCES FOR SOMETHING THAT ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING OPERATION -- ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OR PROCESS SO WE CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING -- MAKES MORE SENSE THAN LOOKING FOR OTHER ENTITIES OUTSIDE -- IF THOSE ENTITIES EXISTED TODAY I THINK WE KNOW WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE BEFORE -- THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE -- YOU KNOW MAKE DECISIONS ON AND SO WE THINK HAVING A FOCUSED EFFORT. THE MODEL THAT ALREADY EXISTS -- MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU MANAGER CERTAINLY. AND OF COURSE THE THE WAY THE PROPOSALS WRITTEN. IT DOESN'T SEEM -- TO ORATION SAY DOESN'T SEE IT. THERE THE FIVE APPOINTEES SOME COMMISSIONS IT DESIGNATES THERE WOULD BE. CERTAIN APPOINTEES WOULD BE. SAY FROM AN ACADEMIC SENATOR CERTAIN APPOINTEES WOULD BE FROM AND YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BASED AND I'M JUST GIVING NOT THAT THIS IS ANALOGOUS BUT IN THIS CASE IT JUST SAYS FIVE APPOINTEES WITHOUT. A SPECIFICATION OF PERHAPS WITH THEIR BACKGROUND WOULD BE. AND DID THE ADMINISTRATION ALREADY HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON OR WHY IT. WANTED TO LEAVE IT OPEN ENDED YEAH I THINK LEAVING IT OPEN AND IT WAS KIND TO ALLOW THEM TO USE THEIR NORMAL DELIVERED A PROCESS TO FIND THOSE WHO HAD THE BEST QUALIFICATIONS TO JUST PROVIDE MEANINGFUL. PARTICIPATION TO THE COMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW -- IT COULD BE A CBO IT COULD BE AN ACADEMIC IT COULD BE YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IT JUST IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THAT INDIVIDUAL HAVING A DEEP ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE PENAL CODE. AND TO REALLY PROVIDE HOW YOU AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW ADDING CONSTRAINTS ABOUT THAT SELECTION CRITERIA -- YOU KNOW COULD MAKE THAT MORE DIFFICULT. ALL RIGHT SO I'M -- LEAVING IT OPEN DESIGN IMAGINING THAT THERE WILL BE SOME INPUT ON THIS APPOINTMENT -- AND ON THE IF IF IT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THEN WHAT SIX COMMISSION WOULD COMPRISE OF ANDERSON -- BUT AT LEAST I DO APPRECIATE THAT IT WOULD BE A SUBSET OF AN EXISTING COMMISSION SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ALL. OF THE FINDING OF A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. THOUGH IT CERTAINLY IS LEGITIMATE TO LOOK AT WHETHER BECAUSE IT IS PART OF AN EXISTING ONE WHETHER -- IT NEEDS THIS LEVEL OF GENERAL FUND. YEAH I THINK -- THE EXISTING COMMISSION STAFF IS SMALL IT'S FIVE AND A HALF POSITIONS -- WE'RE REQUESTING THREE TO THE MURDER ANY IS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE COMMIT COMMITTEE DIRECTLY IN ADMINISTRATIVE SUFFICIENT. POSITION OF A SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMISSION OVERALL. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION WILL SUPPORT BOTH THE COMMISSION. THE COMMITTEE THEY'RE BOTH ATTORNEY POSITIONS AS WELL -- SO. THEY HAVE ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK IN THEIR OWN PROCESS BUT I THINK I'M AT LEAST PROVIDING THOSE LEADERSHIP. POSITIONS -- IN MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE WILL HELP AGAIN -- STAND THIS UP MORE QUICKLY. BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY KIND OF EXISTING -- RESOURCE AVAILABILITY TO STAFF A NEW COMMITTEE WITHIN THE COMMISSION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT ITEM. ALL RIGHT WILL MOVE TO ISSUE SIXTEEN THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. AS YOU ASSEMBLYMAN HAND THE GAVEL JUST FOR A MOMENT TO MY VICE CHAIR. JUST TO RYAN WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU. SO I THINK WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS -- JUST TO CONFIRM ISSUE SIXTEEN SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. AND WE HAVE A HAND OUT WE SHARED WITH US STAFF PREVIOUSLY. OKAY TO SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND LINDA SWAG IS HERE FROM THE C. JUST AND SHE CAN GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT -- AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION WITH THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENTLY ASKING FOR SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. AND THIRTY SEVEN PER PERMANENT POSITIONS IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT WILL IMPLEMENT -- THROUGH -- FOR SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR THAT WAS PASSED -- AT HIS TWO YEARS AGO THE WITH. THAT AFTERNOON THANK YOU. FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THE BILL OF THE OVERVIEW OF THE NEW LAW IF WE TRANSITION CALIFORNIA FROM A LIFETIME REGISTRATION BUSINESS MODEL TO A TIER BASED MODEL BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT TRANSITIONING CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. OF ALL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS INCLUDING THE COURTS D. A.'S PROBATION DEPARTMENTS AT COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND LOCAL REGISTERING AGENCIES. AND THIS MODEL HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS. AND IT REQUIRES US TO DO MANY THINGS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A STATE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS ENHANCE AND MODIFY AND MAINTAIN. EXISTING SYSTEMS AND INTERFACES THAT SUPPORT REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO COLLECT NEW DATA ON ON GOING BASIS INCLUDING CUSTODY -- DATA PETITION DATA. AND NON CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL HISTORY. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO COLLECT MISSING DATA INCLUDING -- DISPOSITION AND RISK ASSESSMENT DATA IN A STANDARDIZED FORMAT. AND IT WILL NOT ONLY REQUIRES TO DO THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN NEW UNITS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THERE IS A LOT OF DESPAIR DATABASES BETWEEN -- LOOK FEDERAL AND STATE DATABASES AND SO A LOT OF THIS WORK IS GOING TO BE A MANUAL WORKLOAD SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A NEW TEARING AND TERMINATION UNITS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE WILL ALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM SYSTEM ACCESS BY A LOT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS -- TO THE DOJ DATABASES THAT SUPPORT REGISTRATION NOTIFICATION INCLUDING CHORDS PROBATION DEPARTMENTS COUNTY CUSTODIAL FACILITIES AND SOME OF THE SMALLER REGISTERING AGENCIES AT THE COUNTY AND THAT LOCAL LEVEL. SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS -- MOST FOLKS WOULD THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO SINCE WE'RE GOING TO A TIER BASED SYSTEM WILL BE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SEX OFFENDERS AND THAT IS TRUE. EVENTUALLY WE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO AS IT DOESN'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS THAT COME INTO THE SYSTEM THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM SO EVERY YEAR ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND NEW REGISTRANTS COME INTO THE SYSTEM. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND REGISTRANTS IN THE DATABASE AND WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND NEW ONES COME IN EITHER THROUGH A CALIFORNIA CONVICTION OR A NON CALIFORNIA CONVICTION AND THEY MOVED HERE FROM OUT OF STATE. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE IS THAT WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO THIS TO YOUR FACE SYSTEM FROM A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS BUT NOT ONLY TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. BUT TO MAINTAIN THAT TRANSITION THIS IS CHANGING CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS MODEL FOR REGISTRATION AND WE WANT. TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT IT. WITH THE MAKING SURE WE HAVE ALL THE DATA WHEN WE DO THIS AND THAT WE DON'T INCUR ANY LIABILITY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE DO IT ACCURATELY AND THAT WE DON'T -- IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS CORRECTLY. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE RESOURCES BOTH FOR THE TRANSITION AND THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FOR ALL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS THAT RELY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A STATE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WE ARE MANDATED AS THE KEEPER OF THE RECORDS FOR THIS DATA. AND WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR TECHNOLOGIES -- AVAILABLE AND AT THE OPTIMAL LEVEL AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL THE ADDITIONAL -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO THEY CAN FULFILL THEIR ROLE IN THIS TRANSITION TO THE NEW TERM BASED SYSTEM AS WELL [inaudible] WHAT'S MY I'M. THIS OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE BEEN A VOTE ONLY. MY ISSUE WAS THAT LAST YEAR. WHEN WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET? WE PROVIDED A MILLION DOLLARS. FOR WELL WE ACTED ON THE BUDGET PRIOR. TO AB THREE ONE ONE AIDES PASSAGE. WE DISCUSSED IT WE WERE COGNIZANT OF THAT BILLS I MEAN. WITH THIS CUSTOM. RIGHT I'M SORRY SIR SO. JUMP TO THE HIGH JUMP TO THE NEXT PAGE ANYWAY -- WE DID PROVIDE FUNDING [inaudible] IN OUR IN THE BUDGET. FOR FROM I'VE. LAST YEAR OF TEN MILLION WHICH YOU MAY HAVE ADDRESS WHILE I WAS OUT BUT THE POINT BEING THAT. WELL IT'S CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE ONE TIME ONLY MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE. IN THAT THERE'S VARIOUS THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PUT INTO PLACE OVER TIME. THERE WILL BE LESS REGISTRANTS. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF THIS TIERED SYSTEM. AND IN THE PAST WE HAD A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO PEOPLE WERE PERMANENTLY [inaudible] AND THE REQUEST. FOR THIRTY SEVEN ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS. ALONG WITH -- WELL I DON'T SEE IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS NECESSARILY ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS -- BUT OUR THE FIRST FUNDING WE PROVIDED HAD SOME POSITIONS SO FOR ME IT'S JUST IT'S I DON'T SEE THE JUSTIFICATION. FOR THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. E. WHEN WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A SEX REGISTRY. WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE MORE PEOPLE BEING PUT ON THE SEX REGISTRY SO THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE APPS WERE WE DEFINITELY HAVE MORE PEOPLE BEING PUT IN ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE MORE PEOPLE AND IN FACT BY OUR STATUTE CHANGE WE WILL BE HAVING. FEWER TO MONITOR OVER TIME. SO -- THAT'S WHY I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE BCP. IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT SO. IT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS ON THE REGISTRY EVENTUALLY. BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T REDUCE IT DOESN'T REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS THAT COME INTO THE REGISTRY WE'VE BEEN -- CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITH APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND REGISTRANTS BOTH CALIFORNIA CONVICTION AND NON CALIFORNIA CONVICTIONS THAT COME INTO THE REGISTRY. CURRENTLY THE MODEL THAT WE USE IN THE REGISTRY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS THAT ONE SIZE ALL IT'S THE SINGLE HIGHEST OFFENSE AND SOMEONE WE HAVE NEW REGISTRANTS COME IN WITH THE TEACHER PAY SYSTEM WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THEIR TOTAL CRIMINAL HISTORY. THAT INCLUDES OUT OF STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY AS WELL AS A TIRE WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO DO THAT ONCE. COLLEGES CUT YOU OFF BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EVERY YEAR. BUT IT. TOO WE WOULD BE DOING THAT FIVE THOUSAND YES BUT YOU HAVE TO PROCESS FIVE THOUSAND RIGHT NOW AS YOU JUST INDICATED AND YOU HAD TO PROCESS FIVE THOUSAND THE PREVIOUS YEAR IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR SO YES IT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN THAT. PROCESSING OF THAT FIVE THOUSAND BUT YOU DON'T HAVE. AND AND NOT ONLY THAT THERE'S A NEW WITH THERE IS NEW WORKLOADS IT'S THE TERRAIN THAT PUTTING THESE PEOPLE INTO THE TEARS AS A WORKLOAD A NEW UNIT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE TO PROCESS THOSE FIVE THOUSAND WE ALSO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PROCESS THE PETITIONS FOR TERMINATIONS ONCE THE COURT GRANTS THE PETITION FOR TERMINATION. THAN THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL GO IN AND UPDATE ALL THE SYSTEMS AND NOTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS AND NOTIFY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AN ARCHIVE THAT INFORMATION SO THERE ARE TWO NEW WORKLOADS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE ALSO HAVE TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT TRANSITION TO THIS AND SO. WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO SEE IF SOMEBODY QUALIFIES FOR TERMINATIONS THEY'RE GOING TO BE REACHING OUT TO US AND ASKING US FOR INFORMATION AND CORRECTIONS TO RECORDS? IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR DETERMINATION SO THERE'S NEW WORKLOADS THERE'S NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NOT ONLY DOJ BUT ALSO FOR ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO. WE CAN WE CAN PUT THIS ON TO A FACT AND WE CAN TRANSITION BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT GOING FORWARD. NOT ONLY JUST THE PROGRAM POSITIONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE. SOME A COUPLE OF OUR POSITIONS ARE FOR RESEARCH AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- DATA DRIVEN EVIDENCE BEST PRACTICES AND THAT'S PART OF THIS THIS IS WELL HAVING THOSE RESEARCHERS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT AUDITS ON REGISTERING AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING CORRECTLY. WE HAVE A LEGAL REVIEW THIS THESE IF WE MAKE THE WRONG DECISION ON PUTTING SOMEONE IN A TEAR IT COULD BE PUBLIC SAFETY OR A CIVIL LIABILITY ISSUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE LEGAL POSITIONS. THAT ARE MAKING SURE THE ANALYST ARE CORRECTLY ANALYZING AND PUTTING THE FOLKS IN THE CORRECT HERE. SO THERE ARE A LOT A NEW WORK FLOWS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED STATEWIDE ON THE DOJ AS WELL AS THE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. AND IT IT'S TURKEY IT'S THIRTY EIGHT TOTAL POSITIONS THAT'S THE TWENTY FIVE THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL POSITION SO IT'S NOT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY EIGHT IT'S THIRTY EIGHT TOTAL. TO TRANSITION THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO NEW THAT THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL. SIR MORE LUCK FROM MADAM CHAIR WAS. ONE OF TWO REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED FOR SB -- THREE EIGHTY FOUR BECAUSE A A ONE SIZE FITS ALL - LIFETIME SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION WAS BRUTAL. TO A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS. AND GOING BACK TO HISTORICAL CONTEXT -- I HAD WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT. WANTED TO PROHIBIT. INDIVIDUALS ON THIS LIST FROM GOING TO PUBLIC PARKS. BUT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE. GEN FATHER'S BEEN COULD NOT GO TO THE PARK WITH THEIR KIDS. OR TO THE BEACH OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER -- WIN MAYBE THEY WERE GUILTY OF URINATING IN PUBLIC. YOU KNOW A VERY MINOR OFFENSE BUT GOT THIS [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] SCARLET LETTER [inaudible] SO. I HAVE A NINE TO TO THE DETAILS BUT WHAT I WOULD SEE THAT IS A FATHER WHO KNOWS A URINATED IN PUBLIC FOR WHATEVER REASON DRUNKARD -- THAT WOULD BE TEAR. ONE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST KIND OF A MINOR OFFENSE THAT'S GIVEN TEN YEARS AND THEN IT'S OFF. AND THEN THERE'S OTHER DEGRADATIONS -- SO DO YOU HAVE CATEGORIES WE DO THEIR TIER THREE TIERS TIER ONE IS TEN YEARS TO YOUR TWO IS TWENTY YEARS AND FIVE THREE AS LIFE. AND WHAT WE CAN SEE NOW JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE DATA AVAILABLE TO US NOW AND HOW WE COLLECT AT ALL. IS THAT ABOUT HALF WILL REMAIN AS LIFETIME -- TWENTY FOUR BUT THE REMAINING WILL BE IN TIER. ONE AND THAT AND THAT'S TAKING YOU. A LOT OF TIME TO GO CASE BY CASE YES SO WE WILL BE MANUALLY REVIEWING EACH OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND RECORDS THAT WE HAVE WE WILL BE RUNNING FEDERAL CRIMINAL HISTORY RIGHT NOW WE ONLY USE STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT FEDERAL CRIMINAL HISTORY STATE CRIMINAL HISTORY AND OTHER DATA AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPEN ARREST. AND WE HAVE A DATA GAP IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE WILL HAVE TO CLOSE ALL THOSE OPEN ARRESTING GO OUT THERE AND GET THAT MISSING DISPOSITION INFORMATION. AND THEN WE WILL DO IT YOUR ASSESSMENT WE WILL PUT THEM IN A TEAR -- AND THEN WE WILL PUT THAT INFORMATION INTO OUR STATE DATABASE AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN ON SEVEN ONE OF TWENTY ONE WHEN -- THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT THAT ELIGIBLE REGISTRANTS WILL BE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURTS FOR TERMINATION. THAN THOSE THAT ARE GRANTED TERMINATION THAT INFORMATION WILL COME TO THE DOJ AND ELECTRONIC FORMAT. THROUGH THESE NEW INTERFACES THAT WE ARE BUILDING AND MAINTAINING WITH ALL THE COURTS AND THE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN THE JAILS BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL THAT. ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF IT IS ANY TIME THAT YOU WERE SPENDING CUSTODY THAT TIME IS TOLD. FOR THE PERIOD OF YOUR REGISTRATION SO IF YOU HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR. TENURE REGISTRATION PERIOD YOUR TIER ONE AND YOU'VE BEEN IN PRISON FOR FIVE YEARS AND THAT TIME DOES NOT COUNT AND SO RIGHT NOW WE DON'T COLLECT THAT INFORMATION. AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY ARE TO US FOR US TO GO OUT AND GET THAT INFORMATION FROM FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYSTEMS COUNTY JAILS. AND HELP THEM PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO US AND SO WE'RE BUILDING THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THEM TO PROVIDE US IS DATA AND WE ARE ALSO BUILDING THE ANALYTICAL AND LEGAL RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE COURTS THE D. A.'S. AND US TO IMPLEMENT THE SO FOR HOW IT HAPPENS ONCE THEY CAN PETITION THE COURT. AND IT MORE PEOPLE WILL PETITION THEN ARE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE NOTHING PREVENTS THEM -- TO PETITION AS YOU SAID IT'S A SCARLET LETTER AND MOST PEOPLE IF THEY THINK THEY CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OFF OF THE REGISTRY THEY'LL PETITION SO THAT. ADDITIONAL WORK ON ON THE COURTS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HELP THEM WITH WITH A PETITION THE COURT IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THAT DATA COMES TO US AND THEN WE WILL. TAKE THEM OUT OF THE STATE'S SYSTEM TAKE THEM OUT OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM TAKE THEM OFF THE PUBLIC MEGAN'S LAW WEBSITE. LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE -- BEEN TERMINATED FROM THE REGISTRY AND THEN OF COURSE ARCHIVE THAT INFORMATION FOR LATER I'M PURPOSES. THAT IT IT APPEARS TO BE A ONE AND DONE AND IT'S OVER AND YOU CAN MOVE ON BUT IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN THIS. AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE COMPUTING THE STORAGE THE SECURITY. AND THE DISASTER RECOVERY THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR THESE NEW UNITS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS THE PETITIONING FOR THE ON GOING BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE. TO PETITION AND IF THEY GET DENIED THEY CAN RE PETITION IN BETWEEN ONE AND FIVE YEARS SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALL THESE REPOSITIONING SO THIS IS. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK INVOLVED SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL WITHOUT INCURRING ANY LIABILITY FROM LAWSUITS IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT OR WE TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO IT. ARE WE INADVERTENTLY PUT SOMEBODY IN THE WRONG TEAR AND THEY GET OFF AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING THAT NO ONE WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN. RIGHT AND SO WHEN THIS BILL WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR. I A WIN THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS CORRECTED TWICE PROBABLY. WHAT KIND OF ESTIMATES DID YOU GIVE FOR COSTS? YES MEN SIR I SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN THE B. C. P. SORRY SORRY SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS FOR THE PROJECT -- AND THERE'S TWO DOCUMENTS THAT WE BROUGHT TODAY AND AND YOU MAY WANT TO AS I KNOW THIS CAMINO OPEN ITEMS WE MAY WANT TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION BUT ONE IS THE THE PERSONNEL NEEDED AT THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE PROJECT. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM TODAY THE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THE NEW SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE SO YOU CROSSWALK FROM. WHAT IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO THE NEW? MODEL AND IT SHOWS YOU ALL THOSE NEW TASKS AND IT IS BROKEN DOWN MY THE REGISTRY SUPPORT STAFF THE I. T. SUPPORT AND AND MINISTRY TO IT AND SO ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT IN. READ IS IS NEW WHAT'S ON THE LEFT IS WHAT WE DO. PURSUANT TO OUR MANDATES TODAY AND THEN ANYTHING ON THE RIGHT THAT IS NEW WITH -- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THREE EIGHTY FOUR AND THIS DOCUMENT HERE ALSO IS A DIAGRAM OF OUR EXISTING REGISTRY. THEN THE ADDITION OF THE STAFF THAT ARE NEEDED TO DO OF ALL THE MANUAL WORK. AND THEN THE REDUCTION AND WHAT WE WILL. BE AT THE END OF THE PROJECT TO HELP MAINTAIN THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION GOING FOR IT. IN A AND EARNED FOR THOSE SAID MAYBE APPLY FOR LOWER TIER DO THEY PAY A FEE. WELL I DON'T BELIEVE SO YEAH BUT THE THEY WILL PETITION THE COURT. RIGHT SO THAT WHILE FILING CHAPTER FILING FEES AS WELL TO BE BUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE'S NO. COST TO THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. CERTAINLY SENATOR MORE LIKE SO. THE REGISTRY HAD. FIVE AND I WANT TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY PRIOR TO THE ENACTING. OF THIS. THREE TIERS IT HAD SIXTY SIX POSITIONS TO MAINTAIN THE REGISTRY THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN WE ADDED TWENTY FIVE LAST YEAR WE DID. OKAY. IN THOSE TWENTY FIVE RUN GOING. ON ALL RIGHT SO. TWENTY THREE WITH -- OMITTED. THEY WERE PROMINENT TWENTY THREE OF THE TWENTY FIVE ARE PERMANENT POSITIONS THEY WERE PRIMARILY THE I. T. POSITIONS SO ARE OUR MODEL IS A TWO DOOR. OUR MODEL IS TO BUILD THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST AND THEN DO THE MANUAL WORK SO WE CAN HAVE A PLACE. TO HOLD THAT DATA [inaudible] OF NO T&lt;c.cyan&gt; HAVE DONE SHOW THAT&lt;/c&gt; THEY WERE ALL I. T. BUT THAT'S OKAY WE'LL LEAVE IT. BUT ANYWAY WE SIXTY SIX AND YOU OUT OF THE TWENTY THREE WHICH BRINGS IT UP [inaudible] TO SEVENTY NINE AND YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M FORGET NOW TO ADD I'M INTERRUPTING YOU KNOW HUGH YOU SHOULD INTERRUPT ME WHEN I ADD WRONG. IN YOUR ITS APPS IT IS A BUDGET IT IS A BUDGET COMMITTEE AFTER ALL -- AND NOW WE YOUR WARNING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS NO NO -- WORK WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SEVENS AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL BE A TOTAL OF THIRTY EIGHT PERMANENT ONGOING POSITIONS. POSITIONS ARE GONNA COME MAN AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET THE LIMITED TERM AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA COME OFF AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL HAVE THIRTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. ON TOP OF THE EIGHTY NINE WE JUST DISCUSSED. NOW ON TOP OF THE SIXTY SIX MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY SORRY I'M HOPING TO HELP PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION I'M A GEN WHICH PART IN A FINANCE -- I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY MISCOMMUNICATION WHEN THIS VCP WAS DEVELOPED ON THE ACTUAL NUMBER ALL NUMBER OF PERMANENT POSITIONS THAT ARE NEEDED SO STOCK THE DEFRAY IT SAYS THIRTY SEVEN BUT I THINK IT TO YOU YEAH I THINK THE NUMBER PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAUGHT. PROBABLY TWELVE I THINK WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT NUMBER BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING US UP FROM THE TWENTY FIVE FROM BEFORE. ADD TWELVE AND IT WOULD BE -- THIRTY SEVEN ANYWAYS. WE CAN WORK OUT THE DETAILS LATER BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I'D I THINK THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY JUST MISCOMMUNICATION ON THE ACTUAL NUMBER. TOTAL ONGOING SHOULD BE RESET FOR USTO VOTE ON AND SO I MEAN I THINK. WHILE I MADE A LITTLE BAD. YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE I'M STILL WORKING FROM A B. C. P. THAT TELLS ME THAT MANY NEW POSITIONS AND I'M SORRY BUT AFTER THE POSITIONS WE ALREADY ADDED. THERE'S NO WAY TO JUSTIFY THAT MANY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO PROCESS THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR EVEN THOUGH WE ARE PROCESSING ON FOR A DIFFERENT TO YOUR SYSTEM -- SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE CLARIFICATION BUT WHAT I WOULD PREFER. APPRECIATE IS A CORRECTED BCP SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. EIGHT THREE LIKE TO KNOW MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY I DON'T THINK THE COSTS OF THE POPOSAL WILL CHANGE THOUGH I THINK IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF THE PRESENT ABOVE THE POSITIONS I THINK THIS IS -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE B. C. P. I THINK IT EVEN TALKS ABOUT A A HIGHER NEEDS THAN -- THIRTY SEVEN TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK PLUS THERE'S A BIG COMPONENT RELATED TO I. T. I THINK ULTIMATELY ON GOING IT WOULD BE THIRTY SEVEN BUT AGAIN THIS IS ONLY A THREE YEAR PROPOSAL WE WILL COME BACK FOR ONGOING RESOURCES -- ONCE WE'VE -- ONCE DOJ IN CT HAVE FINISHED THAT WHOLE PROCESS WITH THE I. T. PROJECT -- AND THEN WE CAN LOOK AT WHILE ONGOING WORKLOAD IS AND WHAT THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE. WHEN YOU DO THAT? YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT WE ALREADY APPROVED LAST YEAR AND THAT THEY WERE I. T. POSITIONS SO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT. THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I T. AND THERE'S A NEW DEMAND ON THE I. T. BUT TO FURTHER. FOR A FURTHER EXPENDITURE. IS. THE HARD STILL FOR ME TO IMAGINE BECAUSE OF AGAIN WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT PROCESSING THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND YOU ALREADY HAD A CORE OF STAFF THAT PROCESS THOSE PEOPLE SO YES NOW WE'VE COMPLICATED THE PROCESSING. SO I'M GONNA EXCEPT THAT DUE TO THE COMPLICATE. COMPLICATION OF THE PROCESSING THAT WE BATTED IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL MORE. BUT THE CLOSEST BUT THE THE THE NUMBER MORE THAT'S BEEN ADVOCATED STILL SEEMS ON JUST FILE BOTH TO ME. ANYWAY. AND THEN YOU HAVE RECORD BCP RISE SO WILL AND THAT'S WHY PROVIDED A DOCUMENT WITH THE SIDE BY SIDE SO YOU COULD SEE THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF WHAT OF WHAT THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAW CHANGED AND YOU CAN SEE THE NEW ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE NEW SYSTEM. SO THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL GOING FORWARD -- WHICH WE FEEL FOR SUPPORT AND OF COURSE IT COULD BE AND WE HAD EXPERIENCES ALREADY WHEN WE WERE. HAVING OUR DISCUSSION WITH CDC ARE ABOUT THE POSITIONS THEY WERE ASKING FOR FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHEN WE REALIZED THAT. IT WASN'T THE POSITIONS THEY WERE ASKING FOR WE'RE NOT REALLY ENTIRELY. TO IMPLEMENT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT BECAUSE THEY HAD OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT CD ZERO IS TRYING TO MAKE. TO VARIOUS OF THEIR PROCESSING OF RECORDS AND SO IF IN FACT WHAT IS BEING ASKED HERE. IS VERY SOME PREVENTS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED INDEPENDENT OF THE BILL. THEN I WANT TO SEE THAT DISTINGUISHED IN THE B. C. P. BECAUSE TO BE ASKED. TO EVALUATE THIS BASED PURELY ON WHAT THE STATUTORY CHANGE REQUIRES IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU A DEPARTMENT MAY LEGITIMATELY WANT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. TO WITH THE WAY IT PROCESSES IT PROCESS SEES. ALSO A RECORDS FOR NOW BECAUSE IT'S SIMILAR. IN BUT DISTINGUISHES BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT NOW DISTINGUISHED IN THE BCP. THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible] ALRIGHT. WE HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL YES. A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT ONE LAST ITEM. OKAY ISSUES THAT. EVIDENCE KIDS -- THE BUDGET INCLUDES A ONE TIME ALLOCATION. OF A HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO GEO J. TO IMPLEMENT AB -- THREE ONE ONE EIGHT WHICH REQUIRES ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MEDICAL FACILITIES AND CRIME LABS -- ANY OTHER PHILIP FACILITIES AT RETAIN -- STORE PRESERVE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF ALL UNTESTED SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. IN A POSITION TO REPORT THEIR DATA TO THE DOJ. SO I HAVE VERY MILLER HERE FROM THE LABS -- TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS -- BEFORE WE ASK QUESTIONS I THINK FOR ME IT'S A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE AS THE DIFFERENT THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS A LOT LESS -- THIS SILLY HUNTER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND BUT AGAIN WHEN I READ. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT GAVE ONE MILLION. THE LANGUAGE THAT SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPILATION OF INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF UNTESTED SEXUALASSAULT KITS STATEWIDE SO THAT THE THAT'S THE REPORT WE HAVE HERE -- IT ALSO SAYS SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO GRANTS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR SUPPORTER LOCAL ASSISTANCE. NOW DEPENDING ON HOW SOMEONE MIGHT READ THAT AND THINK WELL ARE THESE AND AND AND CERTAINLY -- AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THAT. WHERE WE APPROVE THIS LANGUAGE IT WAS CERTAINLY AND A HAND IN HAND RIGHT? AND IT DIDN'T DISTINGUISH IT DIDN'T QUITE PUT OUT THIS MUCH WILL BE USED FOR THIS THIS MUCH ABUSE FOR THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS. O COMPILE THE INFORMATION THAT'S THE FIRST ON THE UNTESTED SEXUAL SOCKETS TEST STATEWIDE. SO. WHY DO YOU NEED MORE MONEY TO DO THE THING WE GAVE YOU A MILLION DOLLARS FOR LAST YEAR? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PERRY MILLER WITH THE GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES -- SO YES -- REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION AND WE DID PUT THAT MONEY OUT THERE FOR THE LOCALS TO USE -- TO DO AN AUDIT OF THEIR SEXUAL SOCKET WORK I'M SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN DO THE REPORT. WELL THE REPORT IS PENDING BECAUSE THE AUDIT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. WITH THE REPORT DUE -- THE JULY THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RIGHT OKAY BUT THE MILLION SAYS I MEAN WHAT. BY ONE GIVE YOU THE ANSWER BUT ARE YOU TELLING US THAT THE MILLION WAS INADEQUATE IT SAYS SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPILATION OF INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT STATEWIDE. SO THAT IS. THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANT THAT'S THREE FORTY WOULD GIVE US ABSOLUTELY AND AND I AM NOT SAYING THE MILLION DOLLARS IS ADEQUATE THE WRIST THERE WERE NO PERSONNEL THEY CAME WITH THAT MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS JUST A MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPILE. GIVE OUT -- AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET AN ACCURATE COUNTING UNTESTED SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. SO WHY DO WE NEED A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND IT'S JUST A LIMITED TERM -- PERSON TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE REPORT COMPILED WITH ALL OF THE DATA THAT'S COMING IN FROM THE LOCALS. AND IF THAT IS -- A LIMITED TERM -- ALLOCATION THAT THIS BODY DECIDES CAN COME OUT OF THAT MILLION DOLLARS THEN. THAT'S FINE WITH ME. WELL IT'S JUST THAT IT IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT. AND NOW CERTAINLY IT'S IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY CONCEIVABLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT FELT IT WAS INADEQUATE AT THE TIME BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IN THE DISCUSSION. THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT RACE THAT YOU KNOW THIS REALLY ISN'T GOING TO BE ADEQUATE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COMPILE THE REPORT. ON YOUR OWN THAT CERTAINLY HEY IT CAN HAPPEN BUT IT. WAS NOT DISCUSSED AND IT WAS PART OF THE ALLOCATION WE GET A SO AT THE TIME I THINK THE THE PURPOSE OF THE ALLOCATION WAS TO DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE THE LOCALS RIGHT TO GET ACCOUNT AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY CONVERSATION AT THAT POINT TIME ABOUT. HAVING -- ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF DOING A REPORT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO EXCEPT THE LINK WHICH UNDERSTOOD AND I THINK THERE WAS A IN ITS TIMING. LINE IN THE BUDGET ACT IT'S IN THE BILL HAT. RATE THE VERY FIRST LINE. THE COMPILATION OF INFORMATION UNDERSTOOD OKAY [inaudible] ANYWAY. EITHER THE LA OR DIFFERENT FINANCE. SENATOR MORE LOOK. SOBRE HOLD IT OPEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. COMMON SIDE OF THIS CONCLUDES THE BUDGET. SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE JUDICIARY
