THIS BILL IS A GOOD COMMON SENSE GOOD GOVERNMENT FILL IT DOES A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE IT ALLOWS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. OTHERWISE WITHOUT THIS BILL UNCOLLECTED BILL TAX LIABILITIES FROM BUSINESSES THAT HAVE CEASED DOING BUSINESS AND NO LONGER EXISTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED ON THE F. T. V.'S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS SECONDLY THIS BILL ALLOWS AFDB TO REDIRECT ITS RESOURCES BETTER CURRENTLY DEDICATED TO THIS PROCESS TO HIGHER PRIORITY WORKLOADS AND POSSIBLY BRING IN THE GREATER REVENUE FOR THE STATE. THE THIRD REASON IS THAT THE SPELL MIRRORS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES. CORRECTLY RESOLVE AND DISSOLVE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. YOU OKAY FOR THE. FOR TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE HAVING THREE WITNESSES PER SIDE THREE MINUTES PER WITNESS. BEING SO. LIVING FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO STEINORTH AB TWENTY ME. FORTY TWO. MISTER STEINORTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FORTY TWO WHICH IS THE WINNER OF MY THERE OUGHT TO BE A LOCK CONTEST. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THIS IDEA COMES FROM THESE TWO YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE FROM MY DISTRICT THAT ARE HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME TODAY. IN AND DUNCAN ARE THE BRAINS BEHIND THIS BILL SO I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS SHORT GIVE YOU TIME TO LET THEM DO THEIR PITCH IN AND PRESENT THEIR INNOVATIVE IDEAS. IT IS NO SECRET THAT CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT PATTERNS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON. WE NEED CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PROMOTE CONSERVATION AND PREPARE FOR A DRYER FUTURE. AND I BELIEVE IN IN TOWN CAN HAVE GREAT GRAY WATER REUSE TAX CREDIT IDEAS AND THE NECESSARY SOLUTIONS. GRAY WATER YOU SYSTEMS HAVE LONG BEEN A PRACTICAL WAY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO AVOID WASTING DRINKING WATER ON LANDSCAPE. UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEMS CAN ALSO BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR FAMILY TO PURCHASE. AB TWENTY FORTY TWO WOULD OFFER A TAX CREDIT TO REMOVE THE FINANCIAL BARRIERS IN ORDER TO MAKE RAIN WATER SYSTEMS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR ORDINARY CALIFORNIANS. BY INCENTIVIZING THE PURCHASE OF GRAY WATER REVIEW SYSTEMS AB TWENTY FORTY TWO WILL PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION WHILE ALSO REDUCING HOMEOWNERS WATER BILLS. I'M JOINED BY IAN FINLEY AND DUNN CAN GLOVER FROM REDLANDS EAST VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL. WELCOME IN AND DUNCAN. I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WHICH. I MEAN IT DIANA DUNCAN I DON'T THINK GOT DUNCAN ARE YOU FIRST I ACTUALLY ACCIDENT A GREAT IN TAKE IT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL WHICH WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF RESIDENTIAL GRAY WATER REUSE SYSTEMS AND HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THE COSTS FOR FAMILIES ALREADY WILLING TO PURCHASE THE SYSTEMS THE SYSTEMS CAN BE INSTALLED IN ANY HOUSEHOLD. AND RECYCLED LIGHTLY USE WATER FROM SHOWERS IN WASHING MACHINES AND ALLOW IT TO BE REPURPOSE FOR OUTDOOR WATERING OF LAWNS AND LANDSCAPES. WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR TO USE ANY NECESSARY RESOURCES TO CONSERVE WATER ON A LONG TERM BASIS IN CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY IN A STATE WHOSE DROUGHTS ARE NOT SIMPLY A ONE TIME PROBLEM IN FACT AS DESCRIBED IN A STUDY BY NO A DIFFERENT BOUGHT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT PATTERNS ARE BECOMING MORE CALM. MEANING THAT WE HAVE MORE TRACK CONDITIONS COMING IN THE FUTURE THAT WE MUST PREPARE FOR. AB TWENTY FORTY TWO WOULD YOU SEE SIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL METHOD TO HELP SAVE SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF WATER EVERY DAY WITHOUT RESTRICTING AL GORE WATERING ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR J. ARTIST SERGEANT AT UCLA'S PUBLIC POLICY IN URBAN PLANNING. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WATER USED ON A DAILY BASIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE RECYCLED TO WATER LAWNS AND LANDSCAPES IN LOS ANGELES ALONE. ALL DISTRICTS AROUND CALIFORNIA NEED TO SAVE WATER IN PRAGMATIC WAYS AND GRAY WATER CAN BE A HUGE ASSET TO DO THIS. AS DESCRIBED BY LARA ALLEN OF GRAY WATER ACTION EACH GRAY WATER SYSTEM SAVES AN ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER PER YEAR. WHICH CAN REALLY ADD UP IN THE STATE WITH SEVEN POINT FIVE SIX MILLION HOMES IN WHICH IT CAN BE INSTALLED BECAUSE OF ITS PRACTICALITY GRAY WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOTHING NEW TO THE CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY HAS RECENTLY LOOSENED INSTALLATION REGULATIONS MAKING IT EASIER FOR GRAY WATER RECYCLING TO BECOME MORE WIDELY USED HOWEVER. IF WE WANT TO TRULY IMPORTANT PLOY THIS UNTAPPED ADVANTAGE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL ASPECT PROFESSOR TO SHAZIA OF UCLA AND OTHER WATER LEADERS DESCRIBED THAT PAYING FOR TREATMENT CAN. BE A FINANCIAL HURDLE FOR MOST HOMEOWNERS AS BENEFICIAL IS GRAY WATER CAN BE WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE FINANCIALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR COMMON CALIFORNIAN FAMILIES IN ORDER TO SEE IT TRANSLATE INTO A TANGIBLE REALITY. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THOSE STEPS WHICH IS WHY WE RESPECTIVELY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS RENT MANY. MR GRAY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. MISTER STEINORTH FOR. REAGAN FOURTH THEY. OUGHT TO BE A LAW BILL. AND. AND AND. TAKE YOU TO THE YOUNG FOLKS HERE WHO OVER WORKED HARD ON WHAT'S AND AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO INCENTIVIZE. WATER SAVINGS ARE CALIFORNIA. IS THROUGH THIS HISTORIC DROUGHT BUT WE REMAIN. DESPERATE FRANKLY FOR WATER SUPPORTER COMMUNITIES IN THE GROWTH AND YOU KNOW. IN THE LAST FOUR DECADES WE'VE GROWN OUR STATE WATER SUPPLY BY MERE ONE PERCENT. IN THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME WITH ALMOST DOUBLED OUR POPULATION AND. TO SIT AROUND SCRATCH OUR HEADS AND WONDER WHAT THE PROBLEMS WE'VE GOT TO INCENTIVIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE EVERY LAST DROP AND TO DO IT. THROUGH THE CARROT APPROACH NOT THE STICK SHOWS THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MORE SENSE THAN THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER BOARD. AND. I WANT TO SUPPORT THAT AND APPRECIATE THEM BRINGING. AND INNOVATIVE IDEA FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY. THIS WILL MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND I'LL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. A LUCKY HE'S USUALLY NOT THAT POSITIVE. OKAY.

LIVING A FILE ITEM NINE AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN A WHICH WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ESTABLISH WATER GOALS AND FUTURE WATER CHALLENGES BY INCENTIVIZING WATER TECHNOLOGY. THE BILL DOES IS THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FIRST. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN REQUEST THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A YOU SEE SATELLITE CAMPUS. FOCUSED ON WATER TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WATER PROFESSIONALS AND TECHNICIANS. SECOND THE BILL ENCOURAGES WATER TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES TO LOCATING CALIFORNIA BY GIVING A TAX CREDIT TO BUSINESSES THAT LOCATE. IN ORVILLE. AND ORVILLE AREA WHICH WOULD BE DESIGNATED AS A WATER TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS ON. AND MANY OF SAID HEY WHY OR BILL WELL I MEAN THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE. THE WATER IS STORED FOR THE STATE TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR WATER. FROM LAKE OROVILLE AND THAT AND THE REST OF WAR THERE AND OBVIOUSLY. AND THE ON THIS IS AN AREA THAT. YOU KNOW THAT IS HOME TO WATER BUT ALSO IS HOME TO THE LOT OF DIFFERENT INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE COME UP AND SO WE WANT TO TRY AND CREATE A HARBOR ON THIS TECHNOLOGY HUB WHERE PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT HAVES. HASN'T BENEFITS AND. A CALIFORNIA MADE FACES MANY WATER CHALLENGES IN WE NEED TO INVEST IN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING EXISTING AND UPCOMING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL HELP US ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES THAT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN ALSO HELP ATTRACT INNOVATORS TO HELP MEET THE CHALLENGES IN WATER PLANNING RECYCLING. TESTING TREATMENT DISTRIBUTION AND MORE. ONCE DIRETTO IS ACTUALLY HAD. A YOUNG MAN WHO DEVELOPED A NEW WATER TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF CREATING CLEAN. WATER. HE ENDED UP TAKING THIS IDEA AND STARTING UP IN HOUSTON. OF BECAUSE OF THE TAX BENEFITS THE COULD GET THERE AND. I RATHER HIM COME HERE TO CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK THIS WOULD. YOU KNOW HELP US MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION I AM TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON ON THIS LEGISLATION AND SO. WITH THAT I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES IMPORTANCE IN SUPPORT INCLUDING THE MAYOR OF OROVILLE INTO DAHLE MEYER. CHRIS TELUS AND. BALLERINA BORROW. SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. I'M LINDA DAHLE MEYER THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF OR THEY'LL. BUY BEEN THE MAYOR FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. AYE CHOOSE TO LIVE IN RURAL AMERICA AND SOME KIND OF GIVE YOU A WORD PICTURE OF WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE TO SIT ON THE WATER COMMITTEES. AND IN MY CITY AS THE MARE I'VE TAKEN ON MANY OF THE WATER PROJECTS. I. WAS DETERMINED TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS NDW ARE SINCE WE ALL LIVE IN THE SAME BACKYARD. BUT WITH THE SPILLWAY INCIDENT LAST YEAR. IT WAS. EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS A WAKEUP CALL. AND I HAD TO DO AN INTERVIEW FEW WEEKS AGO AND THEY SUPPORT WHAT IF IT DID HAPPEN AND I. I DID A WORD PICTURE FOR THE MY CIVIL THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. HAD THE SPILLWAY. COLLAPSED. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OBLITERATED. AND. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT DOWNSTREAM. WOULD HAVE BEEN ERASED ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED. BUT EVEN MORE SO. WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS THE COLLAPSE OF THE WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM? FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE THIRD OF THE WATER DOES COME FROM THE COLORADO RIVER. BUT THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH STARTS IN OR AVAIL I SEE MY WATER COMES FROM GOD EVERYBODY ELSE'S WATER COMES FROM US. WOULD NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE. IN WITHOUT SAID THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OF THE WATER. WOULD HAVE CREATED A HOLE IN THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. AND THAT WHOLE WOULD STILL EXISTS TODAY. AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE ARE PUT THE NUMBERS TOGETHER. BUT. WE SUPPLY EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE NATION'S. FOOD. FROM CALIFORNIA SO REALLY WOULD HAVE CREATED. A UNIQUE SITUATION MANY OF US THAT LIVE IN THIS REGION WHICH THE IF IF YOU'VE GONE TO. IN THIS REGION YOU GOT A SLIGHT PARK. ADD IN SIX GRADE YOUR KIDS GO TO THE SCIENCE CAMPS I KNOW THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MAKING OROVILLE PART ABOUT FOR THE SIX GRADE CENTER. BUT. THE SAME THING WITH THE SIX GRADERS WITH UPPER EDUCATION IT'S WE HAVE ALL THE. WE HAVE THE WATER WE HAVE THE GEOLOGY WE HAVE THE FISH MISTER TELL US WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT THE.

THANK YOU MAYOR NEXT WITNESS. A THANK YOU I AM CHRIS TELL US MY WIFE AND I OWNED A SIXTY ACRES OF RIVERFRONT PROPERTY AND ORVILLE. AND ALSO. HOUSEBOAT MARINA IN SAUSALITO WHERE I LIVE FOR SIXTY FIVE YEARS. SO MY LIFE IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO CALIFORNIA WATER HYDROLOGY AS ARE THE OTHER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. THERE'S NO OTHER COMPONENT OF OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA. AS OUR WATER SYSTEM. AND WITH THE BAY IN DELTA PLAN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE TUNNELS CONFLICTING DEMANDS AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THE SITUATION IS EXTRAORDINARILY FRAUGHT. THE ONLY WAY TO SORT THIS OUT IS WITH GOOD DATA. IN RIGHT NOW THE DATE IS ADEQUATE AND FRAGMENTED. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE DECISIONS WHICH HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS. BE INFORMED BY THE BEST RESEARCH. CONSOLIDATING THE RESEARCH IN ONE PLACE IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS RESEARCH WILL HAVE GLOBAL IMPACTS. AS WATER AND WATER QUALITY IS THE NUMBER ONE CRISIS FACING THE WORLD. I NOTED THE ANALYSIS THAT THE REVENUE LOSSES ESTIMATED OF FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. OVER SURVIVOR TWENTY THOUSAND OVER THREE YEARS. HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS AND GAIN OF AND OPTIMIZE WATER STRATEGY IS IN THE BILLIONS. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO BALANCE ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THERE IS NO DETECTABLE EQUIVALENCY. THIS IS A VISIONARY PROJECT THAT WOULD BENEFIT OUR STATE WOULD BENEFIT EVERYBODY. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT JUST A GOOD DEAL IS IT IS AN ESSENTIAL DEAL. MY NAME IS HELEN TOMORROW OF THE SEA. WE ARE. DIVISION. WE'VE BEEN AN ORDEAL STARTED OUR CAMPING OR WILL IT DECADE AGO THIS IS OUR TENTH YEAR.

MOVING A FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIVES AND WHAT YOU LIKE TO OPEN. YES. IN A REMINDER IT IS THREE WITNESSES THREE MINUTES PER WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE. WHICH SEEKS TO CLOSE THE CARE INTEREST LOOPHOLE AT THE STATE LEVEL UNTIL ACTION IS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CORRECT THIS LONGSTANDING INJUSTICE. THIS MEASURE WILL CLOSE THE GAP BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN PERCENT SURCHARGE A SURTAX ON TOP OF THE CURRENT TAX. CURED INTERESTS AND WILL USE THESE FUNDS TO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNO IT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND INCREASE STAFF TO SUPPORT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL. HEALTH PROGRAMS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SERVICE INDUSTRY. GENERAL PARTNERS AT HEDGE FUND AND PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS OPERATE A MINUTE ON INCENTIVE BASED STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES A FINANCIAL REWARD FOR EXCEEDING EXPECTED FINANCIAL RETURN. IF THIS ACTUAL FUND RETURNS SUCCEED THE EXPECTED FOUND RETURN THE PARTNERS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE PROFITS AS A REWARD OF WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE CARRIED INTEREST. WHILE INCENTIVE BASED COMPENSATION IS NOT UNIQUE. OF THIS DISTINCTION LIES IS HIM AND HOW CARE INTEREST IS TAX. FOR MOST WORKING PROFESSIONALS WHEN WE RECEIVE A BONUS OR COMMISSION THE INTERESTS OF THE INCOME IS TAXED AT THEIR PERSONAL REGULAR INCOME TAX RATE HOWEVER. IN THE EXAMPLE OF HEDGE FUNDS CARRIED INTEREST IS NOT TAX LIKE REGULAR INCOME AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. NOT ONLY DOES THE BILL GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE OF THE TAX SPIRITING BUT ALSO CREATES A NEW PATHWAY TO EXPAND INVESTMENT IN KEY. UP EDUCATIONAL ARM PRIORITIES AS A TRANCE AS IT TRANSITION TO THE RESPONSE OR TO THE BILL. WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF FOR THE PATRIOTIC MILLIONAIRES WHO COULD NOT BE HERE MISTER CHARLIE. SIMON A WHO SCHEDULE. UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT HERE TODAY BUT I DO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM UNITED HE'S LOS ANGELES AND OTHERS WHO WILL SELF INTRODUCE. ALRIGHT. HELLO MY NAME'S ALEX COOPER ON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED TEACHERS LOS ANGELES. BEEN A. A TEACHER FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS IN THE COMPTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN AND. LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN SOUTH LA. WE'RE ABOUT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL BECAUSE. CALIFORNIA HOVERS UP AMONG THE FORTIES. AMONG THE FIFTY STATES IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A BILLION DOLLARS. INTO US SCHOOLS INTO MUCH NEEDED PROGRAMS AS THE AUTHOR SAID IN CT. OUR EARLY EDUCATION AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. SUPPORT MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. OF THIS IS A NARROW. TAX THERE'S A NARROW GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED. SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE FOREIGN FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED. HEDGE FUND MANAGE MANAGERS AND MANAGER GROUPS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. UP PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS OUR MANAGERS. THEY OVERSEE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION AND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO BILLION. IN ASSETS RESPECTIVELY AND. OUR CALCULATION IS THAT ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN CARRIED INTEREST IS UNDER TAXED CURRENTLY. SO THAT'S WHERE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO A BILLION DOLLARS WOULD COME FROM. THIS IS SEEN NOT BROAD SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ALTHOUGH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT ACTED ALL OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ALL OF THE MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. IN BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OF SUPPORTED CLOSING THE CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE. OTHER STATES ARE TAKING LEGISLATION ON THAT ARE ALSO CENTERS OF THIS INDUSTRY. UP HER TO CORRECT THIS SIDE THIS INEQUITY WITHIN THE TAX CODE. AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS THE AUTHOR SAID ABOUT WOULD ALERT THE LEGISLATURE AS SOON AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID TAKE ACTION. SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE CORRESPONDING ACTION. THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT. THESE THE CENTERS OF THIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOS ANGELES AND THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA. AND THE IDEA WOULD BE TO. REDISTRIBUTE MONEY THAT'S CAME TO THEIR TO THE ENTIRE STATE. TO EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE AND SO THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE COULD BE AFFECTED. WE. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. BROAD. BRIDGING ACROSS US SUPPORT FOR EARLY EDUCATION. WE ALL KNOW THE NEEDS OF PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL MENTAL SUPPORTS AND SCHOOLS. AND THE AND THE. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OFFERS LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR BRIDGE BUILDING AS WELL. OTHERS A BROAD COALITION BEHIND THIS INCLUDING COMMUNITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS LABOR BUT ALSO REACHING INTO THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY. ORGANIZATIONS FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE PATRIOTIC MILLIONAIRES WHICH IS A GROUP OF HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS OTHER TOGETHER IS THAT AS AN ORGANIZATION. WORKING TO ACTUALLY TAX THEMSELVES. TO WRITE. REVENUE ISSUES THAT THE STATE HAS. AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID WERE WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AND AND HAVE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME. AMENDMENTS ON THIS I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND TELL OUR MEMBERS THAT.

IT'S OUR PLEASURE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I'M EVEN WITH THE FULL FUNDING OF LCF AT THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE JANUARY'S BUDGET WE WOULD ONLY MOVE FROM FORTY SIX TO FORTY THIRD IN THE NATION WHEN IT COMES DEFINING OUR KIDS. SO WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT FULLY FUNDING THE LC FF DOES NOT PROVIDE US ADEQUATE FUNDING AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WE CAN UTILIZE TO FOCUS IN ON SOME KEY. HIGHLY NEEDED AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORT AND STRUCTURES POR ECT FOR CT  <u><c.green>AS WELL AS</c></u> MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TOOLS THAT THEY NEED.

REPRESENTING THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY. AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION. WE HAVEN'T OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS NOT NARROW. IS VERY BROAD. WE THINK IT'S PRIOR THE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED PURPOSE. THE BILL. AND IT WOULD HARM A BROAD CLASS OF EMPLOYEES A FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS EMPLOYEES. FOR EXAMPLE. A WHAT HARM THE EMPLOYEES THAT DON'T RECEIVE. CARRIED INTEREST OR BENEFIT FROM PER PER A PREFERENTIAL RATES. THE SEVENTEEN PERCENT TAX APPEAR SUPPLY TO. ANY EMPLOYEE WHO HAS ANY EQUITY. INTERESTED A BIT IT IS A BUSINESS INCLUDING A CORPORATION. WHO PLAYS A ROLE IN PROVIDING THE BUSINESS WITH INVESTMENT? ACQUISITION OR FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS DEFINITION APPEARS TO FOR EXAMPLE FIT. BROKER DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISORS EMPLOYEES. IT WOULD APPLY TO THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVE COMPANY STOCK AS PART OF THE EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PLAN. THE BILL I ALSO AFFECTS EMPLOYEES WHO PROVIDE INTERNET SERVICES INDIRECTLY. A REFORM ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FUNCTION. THIS IMPACTS A BROAD CLASS OF EMPLOYEES AS WELL FOR EXAMPLES ASSISTANCE. THOSE THAT OWN A SMALL STAKE A FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY. AS A PART OF THEIR RETIREMENT. COULD NOT ENJOY THE BENEFIT THAT OTHER RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVES THE OTHER EMPLOYEES. AND OTHER INDUSTRIES ENJOY. WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER AND MINIMUS THRESHOLD OF OWNERSHIP. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE AN EXEMPT AN EXEMPTION FOR INTEREST IN HELD A PUBLIC COMPANY. AND FOR EMPLOYEES OF A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY. THE BEEN BILL SHOULDN'T APPLY TO PROPRIETARY TREATED FIRMS. FAMILY OFFICES OR BUSINESSES THAT ARE INVESTING. AND MANAGING ASSETS USING THEIR OWN MONEY. EMPLOYEES OF THESE VISIT BUSINESSES SHOULD ALSO BE EXEMPT AS WELL. SEVENTEEN PERCENT TAX SURCHARGE DISCOURAGES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS. LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES.

SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO IMPROPER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PUBLISHING GIPSON THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OF CERTAINLY A LOT OF. BOB DEBATE ABOUT THIS LOOPHOLE ON THE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND. HERE EVEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO GET IT INTO HIS TAX BILL. BUT THEY DIDN'T GET IT DONE HE WAS YOU KNOW LOOKING TO GET RID OF A LOT OF THESE EXEMPTIONS EXCEPT FOR THE. YEAH THE MORTGAGE INTEREST IN THE CHARITABLE ONES BUT. YOU ALLOW SOFT IN GETTING COULD. AND PAPRIKA SHE REACHED OUT TO ME YOU KNOW A LONG TIME AGO TO START THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. I DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS HOW ABOUT CURRENT BILL. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO INVOLVE OURSELVES IN FEDERAL TAX LAW YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THIS IS. THE TAX CODE. AND SO THESE FOLKS ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS AS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. AND IN CALIFORNIA. WE TAX THIS INCOME WE GET WE TAXIS CAPITAL GAINS AS INCOME SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOOPHOLE IN CALIFORNIA SO IT SEEMS LIKE WERE. EIGHT YOU KNOW INSERTED HERSELF INTO FEDERAL TAX LAW. AND IT WILL RESULT IN A SEVENTEEN PERCENT. TAX INCREASE ON THE FOLKS IN THIS INDUSTRY. AND IT'S IT IT SEEMS TO ME AS BEING KIND OF PUNITIVE AND PENALIZES THIS INDUSTRY. UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDRESSES IT. AND THEN YOU HAVE A SUNSET IN YOUR BILL. AND THE OTHER AND THE OTHER THING IS HAS NEW TAXES AND REGULATIONS COME IN. YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT MANAGE THESE THESE FUNDS MAY CONSIDER YOU KNOW. DOMICILE ING IN ANOTHER. FRIENDLIER TAXED STATES SO. I JUST GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN NOW. AND UP. HERE I'M NOT GONNA BUILD UP TO SUPPORT ITS ERA. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER MANAGER ACTION ON CERTAIN WHO IT IS OUR INTENT TO BE VERY VERY SPECIFIC AS WASTED AS BILL. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HEDGE FUND PARTNERS. ARE EQUITY FIRM PARTNERS ABA CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT TO. TO HURT ANY EMPLOYEE AS IT RELATES TO THERE'S AND ALSO TO. MISTER BROS I'M CONCERNED. THEY'RE NOT PAYING FEDERAL TAXES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A LOOPHOLE RIGHT NOW THOMAS AND WHICH SEVENTY PERCENT THEY'RE NOT PAYING IT AT THE TAX. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I'M PRESENTLY AND SO THIS WILL IN FACT ONE PUT IS ALIGNED WITH OTHER STATES THAT ARE MOVING IN THIS PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND ALSO QUITE FRANKLY WITH CALIFORNIA BEING AS PROGRESSIVE AS IT HAS IN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE. OF JUMPED ON BOARD. SUCH AS NEW YORK NEW JERSEY CONNECTICUT RHODE ISLAND. MASSACHUSETTS MARYLAND VIRGINIA ILLINOIS. AND ALSO A MINNESOTA. THIS WILL FORCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ONE BRING THIS BEFORE THE HOUSE AND ALSO CLOSE THE INTEREST LUPO AS YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS. TALKED ABOUT IT IS BEEN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. THIS BILL GOES AWAY ONCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES ACTION AND SO THERE'S AS WELL AS OTHER STATES THAT ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THERE'S AND BILLS MOVING SIMILARLY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WILL FORCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CHEN DISS AND ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION AGAIN. THIS BILL IS IS NARROWED TO THE POINT WHERE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES ACTION THIS BILLS GOES AWAY UNTIL THEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT JUSTICE ARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. ON GET ALONG WITH THE REST OF CALIFORNIA'S AND ALSO I WANNA MAKE MENTION THIS IS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AT WAS ALREADY ARTICULATED WHERE FORTY SIX IN THE NATION. THIS WILL MOVE IT TO US TO IN A MOVE THE NEEDLE TO RESPECTFUL NUMBER MOVES OUT OF THE FORTY SIX POSITION. WE'RE PAYING AND GIVING ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER PUPIL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A DISGRACE WE TALK ABOUT BEING THE SIX OF THE FIFTH WORLD ECONOMY OF THE WORLD AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF ALL CHILDREN. AND KIDS ARE POLITICS CRACKS AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS NARROWLY ON FOCUS ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION EXPRESSLY FOR. AREAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE AGRICULTURE. MISTER GRAY AND OTHER AREAS TO HELP FOCUS OF ATTENTION OR RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA'S ON CHILDREN AND SO. I'M HERE TO STAND RATES ANSWERING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. HOPE ACT WITH THE THIS IS ME AND OPPOSITION TO WILL HAVE COME TO MY OFFICE. EMILIE AFTERWARDS WE CAN LOOK AND SEE HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND. MOVE THIS BILL FOR AN AMENDED UNNECESSARY AMOUNTS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND. I ALSO APPRECIATE I I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND I SUPPORT WHICH I DO I THINK OF THE SCHOOLS A. AND I SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND. PROGRAMS AND ALL THAT STUFF AND I KNOW TRYING TO DO HERE I JUST YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID EARLIER DISCUSSING CONCERNS ABOUT. OF THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR BUT HOPEFULLY. YOU CAN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ABSOLUTELY FINE FUND THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN SKIPS AND THE. ALL START BY EQUITY RISK GROWS COME TRY TO HAVE SOME. SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE BILL BEFORE US COM. NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS I THINK ABSENT SOME BROADER TAX REFORM DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD THESE. WE'VE HAD THIS DIALOGUE WITH TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW DO WE ENGAGE IN A MUCH BIGGER. PICTURE TAX FROM IF WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT EFFORTS LIKE THIS IS PART OF THAT. ALSO CONCERNS ME BECAUSE. THAT WE'RE NOT. BOUNCING AROUND AS WE TRIED TO ALTER OUR STATE TAX CODE TO. DEAL WITH IT FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN IN FACT WE PROBABLY NEED SOME. SOME SIGNIFICANT. TAX REFORM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TO COMPLEMENT ON OR FRANKLY IN OR IN PLACE OF A STATE BY STATE APPROACH. I HAVING SAID THAT. ALSO. CONSISTS OF MISTRUST COMMENTS I I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO GET OUR PURPOSE OUR PER PUPIL SPENDING. A UP TO RESPECTABLE LEVEL FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE I THINK FORTY THIRD RESPECTABLE BUT. AND FRANKLY IT'S A CALIFORNIA A LEAD THE NATION. IN THIS EFFORT AND WE NEED TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THAT PARTICULARLY AS WE SIT. DIFFICULT THE PEAK BUT AMIDST A. STRONG NATIONAL AND STATE ECONOMY. A. WE HAVE RECOVERED FULLY A CALIFORNIA FROM THE RECESSION NOT EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIAN IS YOU KNOW WHICH GIPSON I LIVE IN. A PART OF CALIFORNIA THAT STILL. SUFFERS FROM HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HOW RICH POVERTY. AND THAT LEADS ME UP TO THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE. TREMENDOUS. ASSETS OF OUR REGION IS IS AGRICULTURE. CALIFORNIA'S TOO OFTEN KNOWN FOR ITS BEACHES THAT'S HOLLYWOOD STARS ARE NOT OFTEN ENOUGH FOR THE TREMENDOUS AGRICULTURE ECONOMY THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND PART OF CAREER TECH EDUCATION IS PROPERLY FUND THEIR FFA PROGRAMS AND OTHER. PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THAT CELEBRATE AND PREPARE THAT NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS AND. THE AG INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS. NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THIS INSTITUTION A AT THE LEVELS THAT I THINK THOSE OF US IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND FORMER HE'S LIKE TO SEE IT SUPPORT IT. AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND IF. IF YOU WOULD AGREE. TO TAKE FIVE PERCENT OF THIS. PROPOSED REVENUE AND SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO THE AG INCENTIVE OF FROM PROGRAM AND GET THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORK OUT THOSE AMENDMENTS I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD ON. GIVE RURAL CALIFORNIA SOME CONFIDENCE THAT SOME OF THIS FUNDING. WOULD BE PUT TO PLACE THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS YOU KNOW TOO OFTEN BECAUSE OF OUR HEAVY RELIANCE ON POPULATION BASED FORMULAS ARE THE THINGS. A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA TAKE A WHY AND SHARE OF ALL THE MONEY. AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CERTAINLY FRED YOU KNOW EACH AND EVERY SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY IN EACH AND EVERY AYE REGION OF OUR STATE. SO IF YOU'D BE AMENABLE TO THAT I THINK I COULD SEE PASSED RIGHT RESERVATIONS A. SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. HELP MISTER BREAUX GET A CHANCE A SECOND CHANCE TO VOTE FOR IT ON THE FLOOR. CERTAINLY APPRECIATED OF MIST MEMBER GRAY. CERTAINLY AS I TALK ABOUT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. IT IS SOMETHING. OF THAT I AM ONES PERCENT I QUICKLY SUPPORTIVE OF. FATHER BOYLE SAID THIS GIVE A MAN A WOMAN A JOB YOU STOP A BULLET. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER OF THAT. AND WE HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THE MERGING TECHNOLOGY WE DON'T WANT TO BRING PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES TO DO THESE JOBS WE MUST TRAIN THIS NEXT GENERATION. IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH THE GLOBAL MARKET AND SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT IN TERMS DOING THAT BECAUSE AGRICULTURAL SPACE IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. CONTINUE THOUGH. GROW AND THRIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT. OTHER. PARTICULAR STATES A LOT OF POWER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE GROWN AND SHIPPED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS VIBRANT AND CONTINUE TO GROW AND SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. TO WORK TOWARDS THAT IN. MADAM CHAIR* FOLLOW UP. FOR THE RECORD SPECIFICALLY A FIVE PERCENT YOU KNOW TO THE AGRICULTURE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AS LISTED AND. EDUCATION CODE ARTICLE SEVEN POINT FIVE SECTION FIVE TWO FOUR SIX ZERO FOUR THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. I MEAN JUST IN GENERAL. WE WILL GO THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE BEFORE WE. IF WE HAVE A QUORUM BEFORE WE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MOST COPS. THE ONLY AUGUST SAYS FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR TO YOU AND YOURS YOUR TEAM FOR WORKING WITH US.

OKAY AND WITH THAT I DO I DO WANT TO REITERATE A FEW THINGS ONE. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THRESHOLD OF OWNERSHIP SO I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH BE I'M OPPOSITION ON THAT I THINK THERE'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THERE THAT I THINK EVERY MEMBER WHO IS HERE AS EXPRESSED. I ALSO WANT TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO YOU'RE ADDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AS A TRAIN AUTHOR YOU'RE EXEMPT FTP IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. REQUIRED TO HAVE TO BE REPORT TO BE ISSUED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF FEDERAL ACTION. I DOT THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE NOTED INCOME AND SHE OF THE COMEDIAN AL SAYS ALSO I WANT TO CLARIFY AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE. ALLOCATING FIVE PERCENT SEPARATE FROM WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED UP TO CT  <u><c.green>AND</c></u> EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION YOU ARE ALLOCATING SPECIFYING THAT AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT OF THE NEWLY GENERATED REVENUE WILL BE USED. TO SUPPLEMENT. THE AGRICULTURE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM. THAT IS CORRECT AS PER SECTION WAS ALREADY QUOTED BY MR CRAP YES ALRIGHT SO WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM THE RECOMMENDATION WILL BE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMITTEE. ETCETERA. OKAY MOVING A FILE ITEM TEN. WE COULD BE QUIET AS WE EXIT THE CHAMBER. LIVING FILE ITEM TEN AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY IF YOU'D LIKE TO OPEN. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. GOT SOME GOOD COMPETITION THERE. HAD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT DAY BE AT THIRTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN A BIPARTISAN MEASURE AIMED AT REDUCING THE CANNABIS BLACK MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. NOW THE VOTERS HAVE ENACTED PROPOSITION SIXTY FORTS UP JUST TO MAKE SYSTEM WORK. WHEN ALL THIS TRANSITION. IS DIFFICULT FOR AN INDUSTRY BEING REGULATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA. THE WAY I SEE THINGS WE CAN EITHER SUPPORT THE LEGAL. REGULATED MARKET. OR WE CAN CONTINUE TO SEE THIS ACTIVITY OCCURRED THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS. UNLIKE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED THE ADULT USE OF CANNABIS CALIFORNIA HAS A SOPHISTICATED GRAY MARKET. THAT HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE VOTERS APPROVED THE MEDICINAL USE OF CANNABIS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. THIS MAKES CALIFORNIA NICHT OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED DON'T USE. CONSEQUENTLY FOUR MONTHS INTO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING LEGAL OPERATORS UNDERCUT BY THE BLACK MARKET. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LEVEES AN ESTIMATED FORTY FIVE PERCENT TAX ON COMPLY AND ACTORS. THIS INCLUDES A FIFTEEN PERCENT STATE EXCISE TAX. THE CULTIVATION TAX OF A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS A POUND SALES TAX RANGING FROM SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE TO NINE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT. AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALSO ADD ADDITIONAL TAXES. COMPOUNDING THIS PROBLEM REGULATED BUSINESSES ARE UNABLE TO DEDUCT BUSINESS EXPENSES FROM THE GROSS INCOME. AND MUST PAY TO ATTEND PERCENT FEE. TO THE STATE. FOR PAYING TAXES AND CASH WHICH MANY DUE DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO SET UP. BANK ACCOUNTS THIS COMBINED WITH THE HIGH COST OF COMPLYING WITH NEW REGULATIONS THE LICENSE FEES HAS LED TO HIGH PRICES IN BECAUSE STICKER SHOCK FOR CONSUMERS. AS WE WILL HEAR FROM BOTH WHITNEY FROM A NEW FRONTIER DATA. CONSUMER DEMAND IS EXTREMELY ELASTIC AS PRICE INCREASES. DEMAND INCREASES. HOWEVER CONSUMERS DON'T TURN AROUND. I'M SORRY TURNED TO AN ALTERNATE PRODUCT. THEY TURNED TO AN ALTERNATIVE MARKET THE BLACK MARKET. THE CEO OF. ART BICU GROUP A CANNABIS RESEARCH FIRM RECENTLY STATED IT'S CLEAR THAT EVERY ADDITIONAL PENNY OF PRICE INCREASE ILLEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS ONLY SERVES TO BOOST THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF PURCHASING. FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW HOW SOPHISTICATED CALIFORNIA'S BLACK MARKET FOR CANNABIS HAS BECOME. CRIMINALS DO NOT PAY TAXES THEM DOWN UNSURE CONSUMERS ARE PURCHASING AGE. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATIONS. BY TEMPORARILY LOWERING THE EXCISE TAXES SUSPENDING THE CULTIVATION TAX FOR THREE YEARS. WHERE ALLOWING TIME FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE BLACK MARKET AND INTO THE REGULATED MARKET? ADDITIONALLY I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE CANNABIS TAX REVENUES. BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY AN INCREASING THE SHARE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS THAT ARE TAXED IN THE LEGAL MARKET. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON AFTER THEY REDUCE THEIR TAXES AND SIMPLIFIED THEIR TAX SYSTEM. WITH ME TODAY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WHOSE JOINT OFFERING THIS BILL. AND BO WHITNEY OF NEW FRONTIER DATA. WHO DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT COMPLIED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HOW CANNABIS TAXES? AFFECT THE BLACK MARKET AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CO PRESENT I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED ON THIS BILL WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION SOMETHING THAT WE. STARTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THE TWO OF US ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WOULD IN JONES SAWYER. AND. COOLEY WORKED ON THE MEDICAL CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT ART HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR GOAL TO CREATE A REGULATED CANNABIS MARKETS PLACE THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC IN CHILDREN. THAT PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENSURE SAFE PRODUCTS AND COMBATS THE LIZARD MARKET AND IT'S THAT LATTER GOAL TO COMBAT ILLICIT MARKET THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. AND THAT WITH THIS TEMPORARY THREE YEAR LOWERING OF TAXES ABOUT REALLY ENCOURAGING AND SENT. INDUSTRY MEMBERS TO MIGRATE FROM THE BLACK AND GREY MARKET INTO AT THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE AND INTERESTINGLY BASED ON STUDIES IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON. BY LOWERING TAXES YOU CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE MORE TAX REVENUE BECAUSE MORE BUSINESSES WILL MIGRATE OVER TO THE REGULATE MARKETPLACE PAY THEIR FAIR TAX SHARE AND CREATE AN AGGREGATED POT. OF TAXES THAT WILL BE LARGER IF. THEM WITH A HIGHER TAX RATE WHICH WOULD BE OUT OF A BAR FROM MANY TO ACT EVER COME TO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. ITS THIS IS TEMPORARY SO WHEN. DEREGULATED MARKETPLACE TAKES ITS TAKES ROOT OUT SO THAT WE WILL RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL TAX RATES BUT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT YEAR YEAR ONE. WHERE? BUSINESSES ARE MAKING THE DECISION WHETHER TO EITHER BE AND ARE CONTINUE AND THE GREATER BUT A BLACK MARKET OR TO GO TO THE REGULATE MARKETPLACE THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOAL. OF THEM SIERRA SAY THE GOAL PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH IS TO BRING EVERYONE CALIFORNIA INTO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. IS GIVEN AS MUCH SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BO WHITNEY I'M THE SENIOR ECONOMIST FROM NEW FRONTIER DATA. NEW FRONTIER IS A. INDEPENDENT TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN. ANALYTICS COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WE OFFER VETTED DATA ON BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. FOR INVESTORS OPERATORS AND POLICY MAKERS. NEW FRONTIER DATA. DATA RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTS HAVE BEEN CITED MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES. A WORLDWIDE AND HAS INFORMED ARMENIAN INDUSTRY LEADERS. A NEW FRONTIER DATA. ARMED IS NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THIS BILL HOWEVER AS A GLOBAL LEADER. IN THE AREA OF CANNABIS INDUSTRY ANALYTICS WE'RE PROVIDING. THIS ANALYSIS AND DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED BILL ONTO THIS ASSEMBLY. I AM NEW FRONTIER DATA HAS PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED AND PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON MULTIPLE CANNABIS REGULATORY DEPLOYMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY IN THE U. S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. I'M ONE COMMON ISSUE FACING. THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS IS HELD TO ENABLE PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKETS. AND HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE CONVERSION FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. WHILE SUPPORTING PUBLIC SAFETY. I'M AN ECONOMICS TAXES SERB TO FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSES TO INCREASE REVENUES TO THE TAXING BODIES. OR TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THOSE BEING TAXED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE TAX POLICIES DEPEND UPON HOW SENSITIVE TAXPAYERS ARE TO CHANGES IN PRICE. I'M. ELASTICITY IS A MEASURE OF HOW DEMAND CHANGES WITH RELATION. I TO A CHANGE IN PRICE AND CONSUMERS OF CANNABIS ARE VERY PRICE SENSITIVE. WHICH MAKES DEMAND THE LAST STICK. AND PRICES THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE DECISION TO PURCHASE. OR PRODUCE LEGALLY. I'M TAXES ON ELASTIC PRODUCTS TEND TO IMPACT. PRODUCERS MORE THAN CONSUMERS. THE CULTIVATION TAX CORRECTS A PERMANENT BARRIER BETWEEN THE LISTED PRICES IN LEGAL PRICES. THAT GAP INCREASES MORE AND MORE AS WHOLESALE PRICES COMMODITIZED. PRODUCERS MUST CHOOSE TO COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET. OR JOIN THE ILLICIT MARKET OR EXIT THE MARKET ALTOGETHER. I'M WHEN IT COMES TO. THAT PRICING COMPETITION WITH ILLICIT MARKET. SO OF THEM SO IN A SENSE THAT THE THEIR CULTIVATION TAX COMBINED WITH THE. AYE EXTRA BURDEN OF THE EXCISE TAXES IS MAKING. CULTIVATORS INTO SPACE LESS COMPETITIVE. AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLY IN THE LIST OF MARKET MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR CONSUMERS TO TOGGLE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO MARKETS. I'M CURRENTLY THERE'S AN ESTIMATED AYE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY JUNE. SIXTY PERCENT OF CONSUMERS OR TWO POINT ONE MILLION. PEOPLE WILL BE PURCHASING IN THE ILLICIT MARKET. A REDUCTION OF THE FIFTEEN PERCENT EXCISE TAX. AND THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX WOULD THEORETICALLY INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. AND WILL MAKE THE PRODUCERS MORE COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT THE ILLICIT MARKET SUPPLIERS. A FOUR PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE STATE EXCISE TAX FOR EXAMPLE. WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE IN LEGAL PARTICIPATION BY ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND CONSUMERS. GENERATING AN ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. DOLLARS OF RETAIL REVENUE. ASSUMING THAT THE. ILLICIT MARKET IS EVENTUALLY MINIMIZED. THE RESULT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE THAT. CONSUMERS HAVE FEWER SUPPLY OPTIONS. DEMAND WOULD BECOME LESS ELASTIC AND TAXES COULD THEN BE GRADUALLY RAISED. I AM IN ORDER TO INCREASE REVENUES. I AM SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE TAKE AWAY THAT I GAVE I'M IN ADDITION TO THIS TESTIMONY. AMONG OTHER A SIX PAGE RIGHT UP HERE THAT PROVIDE SOME CHARTS AND GRAPHS. SOME OF THE. IMPACT AT THE OF THE CULTIVATION TAX. I'M ON COST RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCERS CULTIVATORS. SO AT THIS POINT. I WILL JUST TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM.

WHATEVER YOU READY MUST FULFILL. MISTER CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR. COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT THIS STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE ACT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WORKS TO ADDRESS THE COLLEAGUES DEAD EPIDEMIC IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. AS MOST OF US KNOW. OUR NATIONAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS REACHED ONE POINT FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO THE HILL IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS ALONE ONE THIRD OF EMPLOYERS HAVE INCREASED EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FORCING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS BACK TO SCHOOL. TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND INCUR MORE STUDENT DEBT. STUDENTS. IN. COLLEGE TODAY KNOW THAT AND THEY'RE GOING FOR HIGHER AND HIGHER DEGREES TO BECOME COMPETITIVE. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVEN EIGHT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE LOAN EPIDEMIC IN OUR OWN STATE BY PROVIDING A TAX FREE INCENTIVE ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PLAN. CURRENTLY A STUDENT REPAYMENT PLAN OFFERED BY AN EMPLOYER THIS IS AN EMPLOYEE OR BENEFIT. IT'S CONSIDERED TAXABLE INCOME. OR A WAGE. FOR THE EMPLOYEE LEAVING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA GRADUATES FACE IN RESIDUAL INTEREST CHARGES AND INCREASED DEBT. THE TAX FREE INCENTIVE ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PLAN WILL ASSIST. RECENT GRADUATES IN GETTING OUT OF DEBT. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT ENJOYS BIPARTISAN BACKING THANKS EVERYBODY. WITH IT'S CO AUTHORS AND SUPPORTERS AND LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ON ADDING A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON THIS MAJOR. FOR THESE REASONS MEMBERS I HOPE YOU SUPPORT ME IN SUPPORTING THIS MAJOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEONE IN SUPPORT. IF IT. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INVITING ME MY NAME IS DANA MAY HUGH AND I AM THE CHAIR OF PIRATE PASADENA'S LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. I WAS ASKED BY CAL SURE ROOM TO TESTIFY ON THE BENEFITS OF CALIFON TUBE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. FOR PASSING EMPLOYER SUPPORTED STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH ENABLE EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN. TALENT. MANY OF WHICH ARE MILLENNIAL STRAPPED WITH CRUSHING DEBT. THIS IS SOMETHING I TAKE BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY. VERY SERIOUSLY. FROM A PROFESSIONAL SIDE AS A HUMAN RESOURCES CONSULTANT WE ARE HAVING A DEPENDENCE OF THE TIME RECRUITING AND RETAINING TALENT. ON A PERSONAL SIDE I HAVE A YOUNG SON THEY ARE AND LEAVE RECENT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE WHO HAS GRADUATED WITH HONORS WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT. TRY TO LIVE WHEN YOU'RE PAYING THAT ONE BACK. SO WHERE ARE WE IN HUMAN RESOURCES IS A BELEAGUERED HUMAN TELL YOU WITH RESPECT TO ROUTE OF. CANNELLA OF AND TO RECRUITMENT IT'S A SELLER'S MARKET THAT MEANS IT'S DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT AND EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. AND THIS IS NOT BY ASSURE YOU BECAUSE MILLENNIAL SIR HOME MONEY HUNGRY INDULGE CHILDREN WITH BLOW BLOATED EXPECTATIONS. IN MANY WAYS TALENTED TAXES OF THE THOU BE MILLENNIALS HAVE A BAD RAP FOR. BEING FIERCE JOB HARD HUNTERS. IN TRUTH. THERE STUDENT LOAN DEBTS ARE SO STAGGERING THAT ONCE THEY'VE PAID FOR THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE THEY HAVE PITIFULLY LITTLE TO REMAIN TO WORK WITH. AND SUSTAIN THEIR. SUSTAIN THEIR THEIR LIVES ANY STYLE OF LIVING. AND THEN ONCE THEY FIGURED OUT THE COST OF LIVING WHEN THEIR CURRENT JOB THEY HAVE ONE EYE ON THE DOOR. ACCORDING TO SURVEYS BY SHERMAN I ON TUITION AND THE AMERICAN STUDENTS ASSISTANCE BORROWERS WORRY ABOUT BORROWERS WORRY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY LOANS. THAT THE US THEY DIFFER DELAYED THERE IF A FUTURES ISM. SUCH UNNECESSARY THINGS IS RETIREMENT. HOMEOWNERSHIP AND EVEN FAMILIES. IF A. THIS STUDY SHOW THE LOAN PAY. LOAN PAID BACK STRESS REALLY. STRESS IT MOVES NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE YOUTH OF OUR. OF. OUR NATION AND SPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA THE HEALTH OF THESE BORROWERS. IT COSTS EMPLOYERS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. OF THE ANNUAL WAGES TO REPLACE AN EMPLOYEE. AND SO THE RECRUITMENT RETENTION OF NEW EMPLOYEES REALLY BECOMES QUITE DIFFICULT WHEN THE THE BORROWERS HAVE TO GO DUDE TO GREENER PASTURES. I AM TUITION STATES THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BORROWERS DESIRE DOT DESIRE STUDENT LOAN REPLACEMENT CONCURRENTLY. EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE BORROWS SAID AND LISTEN TO THIS CAREFULLY THEY WOULD COMMIT TO AN EMPLOYER FOR FIVE YEARS. COMPANY HELP THEM REPAY THE LOAN MILLENNIALS DON'T COMMIT FOR ANYTHING LET ALONE FIVE YEARS. SO IT PEAK AT TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL HELP EMPLOYERS RETAIN TALENT BECAUSE IT'S OF A. MAJOR RELIEF FROM. BORROWERS FINANCIAL STRIPS IT INCREASES CORPORATE PROFIT IT INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY. IT SETS PUNITIVE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS ON A SECURE FINANCIAL PATH IT CREATES A HOMEOWNERS WITH THE STATE CALLED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IT INSURES LENDERS PAY BACK IT REDUCES EMPLOYER. EMPLOYER PAY EQUITY ISSUES. AND IT DECREASES THE SKILL GAP BECAUSE MORE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE GETTING HELP THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN. CONTINUE WITH THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION FOR THIS AND MANY MORE REASONS I URGENTLY. REQUEST THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE. WELL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. TO VOEPEL DISCUSS ENJOY IT SUPPORT SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES SO IF YOU LIKE CLOSE. PLEASE VOTE I. THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE THAT UP AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM. JOHN.

IS REQUIRED TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ALSO CALLED THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX IN CALIFORNIA THE IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS. OF ITS SIZE OR PROFIT CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO. TO ENTRY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT CAPITAL IS WHEN STARTING UP. ESPECIALLY ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO GET OFF THE GROUND PRIOR TO MAKING ANY REVENUE TO CRITIQUE. AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. DEBTS EVERY PENNY THEY HAVE THEY CAN KEEP TO PUT IT BACK INTO THE BUSINESS WHILE EVERYBODY SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. IT MOVE IT MARK THAT MAKE SENSE THAT OUR STATE POLICY. WOULD NURTURE THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT DOESN'T HINDER SMALL BUSINESS BUT ACTUALLY ALLOWS TO PROSPER AND GROW INTO A LARGER BUSINESS WHICH TURNS THEM INTO A GREATER. REVENUE GENERATOR SO AB TWENTY FOUR TEN WOULD LOWER THE YEARLY FEE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS. AND.
