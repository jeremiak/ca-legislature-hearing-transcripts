SENATE THIRD READING COLLEAGUES FILE ITEM SIXTY TWO MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL NUMBER ONE BY SENATOR ALLEN AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS SENATOR ALLEN MATTER PRESENT MEMBERS I'M VERY PLEASED TO JOIN WITH MY SEAT MATE. AND FRIEND CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO PRESENT SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT ONE WHICH IF PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD. PLACE THE MEASURE ON A FUTURE STATEWIDE BALLOT ASKING VOTERS TO REPEAL ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR OF CALIFORNIANS CONSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE PROVISION WHICH WAS PASSED BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY REQUIRES MAJORITY APPROVAL BY THE VOTERS OF A CITY OR COUNTY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION ACQUISITION OF A PUBLICLY FUNDED LOW RENT HOUSING PROJECT THE MEASURE WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO. THE FEDERAL HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY NINE WHICH IS PART OF HARRY TRUMAN'S FAIR DEAL. THAT SOUGHT TO HELP POST WAR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF THE SLUMS AND INTO A BETTER LIVING SITUATIONS. SO. IT WAS A IT WAS A- VERY PROBLEMATIC. MOVED BY BY OUR FELLOW CITIZENS AT THE TIME BUT THE GOLDEN STATE HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY OUR SOCIETY HAS HAD VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ABOUT RACE AND ETHNICITY CLASS AND POVERTY BUT IN ADDITION THERE ALSO A LOT MORE TOOLS FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO ALTER A BLOCK PLANS FOR NEW HOUSING THAT DID NOT EXIST BACK IN IN NINETEEN FIFTY THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BACK THEN THERE WAS NO BROWN ACT THERE WAS NO COASTAL ACT THERE ARE FAR FEWER LAWSUITS. SO THE GAME IS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT WITH REGARDS TO CITIZENS RIGHTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT HOUSING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO NOW AS A RESULT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR REALLY DOES STAND AS AN ANACHRONISTIC CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER THAT SUBJECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A COSTLY WEBER REGULATIONS IN ELECTIONS DRIVING UP THE PRICE. OF BUILDING PUBLIC ANSWER FOR THE HOUSE. AND THE THING IS THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THEY WANT US AS LEADERS. SUDDENLY TO FIND. AND IF FOR HOUSING THERE BEEN STATE AND LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES UP DOWN THE STATE. THAT HAVE DEDICATED NOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. TO TACKLING OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. CRISIS AND WE REALLY DO OWE IT TO THESE TAXPAYERS AND THE VOTERS WHO STEPPED UP. TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF MEASURES TO USE THIS MONEY AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE REALTORS WHO ARE ACTUALLY BEHIND THE ORIGINAL. YOU KNOW PUTTING THE ARTICLE THIRTY FOR THE CONSTITUTION BACK. IN NINETEEN FIFTY HAVE COME ON IN SUCH ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT. OF SCA ONE TODAY THEY RECOGNIZE THE STATE'S CHANGE THEY RECOGNIZE. THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ASSIST WITH BUILDING HOUSING. AND THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS REALLY ARE GOING TOWARD. THE CONSTRUCTION HOUSING AND NOT. I ENDING UP IN IN UNNECESSARY FIGHTS. SO VOTE FOR THIS IS IN IN SUPPORT. OF GIVING VOTER PARTICULARLY TO THE KNOBS. OUR CONSTITUTION CURRENTLY UNDERMINE BELIEVER THEIR THEIR ELECTED LEADERSHIP. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S ACUTE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. CHALLENGES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. JOINT AUTHOR WITH THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA AND IN STRONG SUPPORT IN FINALLY REPEALING. AND DELETING ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. JUST TO BE VERY BLUNT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR IS A SCAR ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IT IS THIS CAR ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS MORTIFYING. THAT WE HAVE THIS PROVISION IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR DUDS. IT TAKES ONE CLASS OF HOUSING. HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND SAYS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DOT HOUSING CAN BE APPROVED IF IT AS ANY PUBLIC FUNDING AND IT. IS TO GO TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. NO OTHER OF HOUSING IS SUBJECT TO THAT REQUIREMENT ONLY. SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND IT SENDS A VERY VERY CLEAR SIGNAL. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT HARD. THE CALIFORNIA WANTS TO MAKE IT HARD. TO PUT LOW INCOME HOUSING HOUSING FOR OUR RESIDENTS MOST IN NEED OF HOUSING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS GIGANTIC ROADBLOCK. IN FRONT OF THAT HOUSING FOR OUR LOW INCOME NEIGHBORS BUT NOT IN FRONT OF ANY OTHER KIND OF HOUSING. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT THIS WAS EVER PLACED INTO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IT SOUNDED VERY CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO REMOVE TO EXCISE THIS CAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR NEEDS TO GO. WE SHOULD SEND THIS TO THE VOTERS AND FINALLY MOVE FORWARD TO A BRIGHTER HOUSING FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE CAN HAVE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED MORE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. AND THIS WILL HELP US DO THAT I HEARD AND I GO. CENTER WINNER CENTER DOLLY. DO YOU THAT A PRESIDENT TO QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION THAT FROM FROM MY GOOD FRIEND ABSOLUTELY. ONLY PLEASE PROCEED REALLY TO ASK A QUESTION BUT I WANTED TO SO IS IT PURELY JUST GONNA AT REPEAL AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ANYTHING ELSE ON THE BALLOT THAT ADDS ANY OTHER DIFFERENT STATEWIDE INITIATIVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE A CONCERN FOR ME. IF YOU WERE GONNA ADD OTHER LANGUAGE I THINK THE REPEAL IS A GREAT AYE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. LAST REPEALING THAT I WE'RE NOT PUTTING SOMETHING ELSE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT. REPLACES IT WITH. SOME OTHER STATEWIDE INITIATIVE I LIKE TO LAUGH IT ALWAYS BE WHERE WHEN. WHEN AN AUTHOR BECAUSE THEIR BILL SIMPLE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS REALLY A SIMPLE IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT IT REPEAL THAT PARTICULAR ARTICLE. FROM THE CONSTITUTION. AND. AND I DON'T I THINK IT'S ONE REASON WHY THERE IS LITTLE YOU KNOW LISTEN OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORT IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES FROM. LEFT TO RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY HAS COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE REPEALED. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL. MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SAW I STAND IN FAVOR OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT OF WHEN I WHEN I WAS A STUDENT STARTING URBAN PLANNING I ACTUALLY STUDIED ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR AND WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THIS IS. ON OUR CORE-WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES NINETEEN FIFTY CORRECT AND IT WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT SO TOTALLY BASED ON RACIAL PREJUDICE. THIS IS A RACIST BALLOT MEASURE WE SHOULD ELIMINATE THIS. FROM THE STATE CONSTITUTION. AND I URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS. THE ONLY REASON THIS ARTICLE WAS ON THE BALLOT IS BECAUSE OF RACIAL PREJUDICE WE HAVE TO LAMINATE THIS FROM THE STATE CONSTITUTION OURS AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAY CLOSE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND YOU DO REASSURED MY FRIEND FROM NORTHEAST FORCE IN THE STATE THAT THAT THIS IS AS SIMPLE AS IT IS IT IS REPEALING THIS THIS. ARTICLE THERE'S NOTHING MORE THAN THAT EIGHT TRULY IS AN ANACHRONISTIC PIECE OF OUR CONSTITUTION I THINK EVERYBODY'S COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND I REALLY DO ASK FOR YOUR YOUR SUPPORT FOR PUTTING US ON THE BALLOT IN GIVING. OUR VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THIS ANACHRONISM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO SUBSTITUTING A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL. SEEING AND HEARING NONE ARE AS THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO. THE MEASURE PASSES.

TO USE THEIR CAMPAIGNS FUNDS TO COVER CHILD CARE EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR CAMPAIGNING ANYONE WHO CURRENTLY TRIES TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE THESIS RISK AND UNCERTAINTY RELYING ON A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD INFORMAL ADVICE LETTER BY THE F.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M CENTER RISE BRIEFLY TO I'LL BE VOTING NO ON THIS AND JUST WANT TO GIVE A QUICK EXPLANATION THAT THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS NOW IN CONGRESS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN FUNDS AND. THIS CONCERN THAT THE THAT THIS MIGHT APPLY HERE AS WELL AND SO I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR MORALE YEAH I A RISE ALSO JUST A QUICK EXPLANATION I IT IT IT IT. HAS I THINK BAD OPTICS IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER PERK FOR POLITICIANS AND SELL. I JUST CAN'T GO THERE LIVE KIDS BUT I THINK IF ARE GOOD PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN US MONEY WE SHOULD BE USING I'M STRICTLY ON CAMPAIGNS SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ. I JUST WANNA RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM I KNOW THAT AS A MOTHER MYSELF WHO RAN A CAMPAIGN JUST RECENTLY WITH THE FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS POSITIVELY THAT ALLOWS MORE PARENTS TO BE ELECTED AND IT PROVIDES MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE IN OFFICE AND ESPECIALLY GETTING MORE MOM SELECTED WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED SO I THINK YOU FOR MANAGING THIS AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLINGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT I SAW THIS BILL IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. AND IT BOILED DOWN TO THIS FOR ME. LOOK WE ARE IT IS TRANSPARENT YOU INTO THE F. PPC. YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU SPENT THE MONEY IT'S NOT. IT'S ABOUT IT BEING GIVEN A PARENT THE OPPORTUNITY. TAXI RUN FOR OFFICE. AND WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING. BEE SEMI THEY CAN WATCH YOUR CHILDREN I THINK THIS IS GOOD FOR FAMILIES I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. AND I THINK IT IS TRANSPARENT I THINK IT SHOWS WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING LOOK IF YOU'RE- CAN YOUR DONORS. DON'T APPROVE OF YOU SPENT ON SOCCER THEY WON'T GIVE YOU THE MONEY. I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILDREN. TO ACTUALLY RUN FOR OFFICE AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWENTY AS A SINGLE WORKING WOMAN WHO DID USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR CHILDCARE AS A CANDIDATE TEN YEARS AGO THE REPORTING AGENCY HAD A LETTER ON FILE THAT GAVE PERMISSION BUT THAT THERE WERE PRIMARILY WOMEN CANDIDATES WHO WERE SCARED TO CHALLENGE THAT THEY DID WANT TO TAKE A RISK. AND SOMETIMES YOU BACKS AGAINST THE WALL YOU HAVE TO TAKE A RISK AND I USE THEM ALL EXPLAINED IT TO MY DONORS CAN FEEL IT WAS A COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE EXPENSE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT PARKS ON SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES PERCEIVE ABOUT THESE JOBS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU BUT- LAST TIME I CHECKED WE DON'T GET PENSIONS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU BUT I TOOK A 50% PAY CUT FOR THE PLAY A PRIVILEGE OF SERVING MY CONSTITUENTS. AND SO I THINK THIS IS REASONABLE IT'S TRANSPARENT IT'S FAIR AND AS A ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS NOTION SO WE CAN. HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE REACH PARITY AS WE ARE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT WE CAN REACH PARITY IN ELECTED OFFICE AND SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. AS IN A STANDING EXAMPLE OF THE DENTIST AS A BENEFICIARY OF WHAT AB TWO TWENTY IS ATTEMPTING TO DO. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU THE I. DISCUSSION SO FAR IN THE FLOOR AS ALWAYS IS VERY ILLUMINATING THIS MEASURE BENEFITS ALL PARENTS THOUGH LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH I THINK THAT OUR MOTHERS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED. BY TRYING TO JUGGLE THE BURDENS OF THINGS LIKE CHILDCARE THEIR WORK AND ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AND UNDER OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALLOWABLE EXPENSES THAT ARE EXPECTED UNDER THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN WELL CERTAINLY A DOZEN COPPER ONES LIVING COSTS. THERE ARE TRAVEL AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT ARE ALLOWED AND SO GIVEN THAT. ANY CANDIDATE. IS OBVIOUSLY HAS NEW OR MORE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BEING OUT AND ABOUT IN THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY ARE CAMPAIGNING THUS NEEDING IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN TO NEED CHILDCARE IT JUST MAKES SENSE FOR US TO INCLUDE THIS IN ONE OF THE ALLOWED EXPENSES IT IS NOT A PERK AND WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO AN ACT RELATING TO TENDENCY SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES EVERY SESSION THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF BILLS THAT REALLY STAND OUT. BECAUSE OF HOW BADLY THEY'RE NEEDED AND HOW MUCH GOOD THEY WILL DO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TO THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S FACING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE WORK TO ADDRESS THIS BY PASSING THE HISTORIC TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE PROVIDING SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS FOR NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND PROVIDING OVER ONE BILLION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN EMERGENCY AID FOR THE HOMELESS. DESPITE THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS A QUESTION THAT CONTINUES TO KEEP MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS UP AT NIGHT. IS HOW WILL I STAY IN MY HOME AFTER THE NEXT BIG RENT INCREASE. THE REALITY IS THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE STATE IS MADE UP OF RENTERS. AND MANY OF THESE RENTERS ARE THREATENED WITH HAVING TO MAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN A ROOF OVER THEIR FAMILIES HEAD OR PAYING FOR BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD AND MEDICINE. CONSCIENTIOUS LAND RECOGNIZE THIS AND THEY'RE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL PARTNER WITH US ON EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE HOUSING OF THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY. YET UNLESS YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THE FIFTEEN CITIES WITH RENT CONTROL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTION AFFORDED TO YOU. IF YOUR LANDLORD WANTS TO RAISE YOUR RENT BY FIFTY A 100% TO UNDER PERCENT. ARE KICK YOU OUT ALL TOGETHER THOSE STORIES ARE REAL. AND THAT'S WHERE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO COMES IN. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO SETS A RENT INCREASE CAP AT 5% PLUS INFLATION NOT TO EXCEED TEN PERCENT. AND THAT ALLOWS AMPLE ROOM FOR LANDLORDS TO RAISE RENTS TO COVER COSTS WHILE PROTECTING TENANTS FROM THE KIND OF RED GALGIANI. THAT LEAD TO DISPLACEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO PROTECTS TENANTS BY REQUIRING A LANDLORD TO PROVIDE A JUST CAUSE TO EVICT AFTER A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS. AFTER THAT A LANDLORD WILL STILL BE ABLE TO AFFECT A BAD TENANT FOR ANY REASONABLE REASON ONE MIGHT EXPECT FAILURE TO PAY RENT VIOLATING THE LEASE AGREEMENT. BEING A NUISANCE TO OTHER TENANTS AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS THOSE ARE READ. THOSE ARE ALREADY HAPPENING AND THE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE HOWEVER JUST FALLS WILL ENSURE STABILITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF TENANTS WHO DON'T CAUSE ANY ISSUES. AND SIMPLY SEARCHING FOR A STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. A FEW THINGS ABOUT AB EIGHT FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THAT IT DOES NOT DO. IT DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY THERE IS A SUNSET. DOES NOT APPLY TO NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS FIFTEEN YEARS. MEANING THAT IT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT NEW CONSTRUCTION RIGHT. BY AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS WE WANT TO KEEP SUPPLY HAPPENING AS WE DEAL WITH THE CURRENT CRISIS. IT DOESN'T APPLY TO OWNER OCCUPIED OCCUPY DUPLEXES OR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT ARE NON CORPORATELY OWNED. THEIR BY EXEMPTING SMALL LANDLORDS WHO ARE RENTING THEIR STARTER HOME OR OTHER UNIT IN THEIR DUPLEX. AND FINALLY IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO COSTA HAWKINS. COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA TURNED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE YEARS OLD THIS WEEK. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY OF THOSE ONE SIXTY NINE YEARS WE'VE HAD A LAW ON THE BOOKS. THAT PROHIBITS PRICE GOUGING ABOUT NATURAL DISASTER I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT THIS HOUSING CRISIS WE ARE IAN SHOULD ALSO TRIGGER. THAT KIND OF CAP TO PROTECT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA RENTERS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE Là AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS NOT RENT CONTROL. WITH ITS EFFECTIVE ANTI GELDING PROVISIONS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL BE THE STRONGEST RENTER PROTECTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR AT CONSENTED WILL FOR PURPOSE SIR. FOR REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN THEM AND MATT A LOT I MEAN EXCUSE ME IN THE **** LOUNGE. HI THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR WORK REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN THE **** LOUNGE WOULD PLEASE RETURN TO THE FLOOR WE ARE UNDER DEBATE. AND DISCUSSION ON FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY SEVEN. THE FOUR MEMBERS WOULD PLEASE RETURN TO THE FLOOR REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAS CONCLUDED FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY SEVEN THIS IS THE TIME FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. WE'LL START WITH SENATOR WIENER. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. HE'S ME I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND I WANT TO THANK. MY OWN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME MEMBER TO FOR LEADING ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL I KNOW IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT BUT I ISN'T A VERY GOOD PLACE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING IT'S SUCH AS REALLY A CRISIS FRANKLY IT'S A DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. WE STARTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE DID IT AGAIN THIS BUDGET SIGNIFICANTLY FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO KEEP DOING THAT. WE NEED TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION DRAMATICALLY A NEW HOUSING TO FILL OUR THREE POINT FIVE. MILLION HOMES. COLLEAGUES COULD WE PLEASE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION IF YOU HAVE TO CONVERSE PLEASE TAKE IT EITHER OUTSIDE OR TO THE BACK OF THE HALL THIS FOR THIS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. THANK YOU. ARE WE NEED TO MADAM PRESIDENT DRAMATICALLY RAMP UP PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF HOMES IN CALIFORNIA OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES WE'RE DOING THAT WORK AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THERE BUT JOB NUMBER ONE IS KEEPING PEOPLE STABLE AND THE HOUSING THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW DOTS HOW WE STOP HOMELESSNESS FROM GROWING. THAT'S HOW WE STOP PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO WE MUST KEEP PEOPLE STABLE AND OUR HOUSING AND RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA AS THE PRO TEM MENTIONS THE VAST MAJORITY OF RENTERS OVER 40% OF CALIFORNIANS RAN AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF RENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ESSENTIALLY NO PROTECTION FICTION WORK FROM HUGE RENT INCREASES AND IT'S ONE THING WHEN A LANDLORD IS HAS A MODEST RATE INCREASE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF THE HOME AND INFLATION. IT'S ANOTHER THING ONE RENTERS ARE ROUTINELY GETTING NOTICES THAT THE RENT IS GOING UP BY. TEN TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY A 102100% WE KNOW IF. THE RENTERS WHO ARE GETTING DRAMATIC RENT INCREASES. DOUBLING TRIPLING THE RENT IN ONE FELL SWOOP THAT IS NOT HOW YOU ACHIEVE HOUSING STABILITY THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE STABLE AND THE HOUSING THEY HAVE AND AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL HELP TO DO THAT BY PUTTING A VERY REASONABLE CAP IN PLACE 5% FROM IMPORTANT PLOT BY PERCENT PLUS INFLATION. THAT IS A VERY VERY REASONABLE CAP FROM A LANDLORDS PERSPECTIVE AND BASIC JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WARNER SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT SO I. PROBABLY JOIN WITH THE PRO TEM PRESENTEDTHIS MEASURE AND WOULD LIKE TO STRESS SOME POINT SHE MADE AND ADD A FEW NEW ONES TO THE IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS FOR THIS MEASURE. AS SHE SUGGESTED THE MOST BASIC HUMAN NEEDS ARE FOOD ON THE TABLE. AT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT ROOF. EACH OF US IN THIS CHAMBER DEEPLY UNDERSTAND THE TASK AHEAD OF US TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING SUPPLY MISTER WEINER TALKS ABOUT OFTEN. WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH STREAMLINING DEVELOPMENT IDENTIFYING SURPLUS LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR GETTING CREATIVE WITH ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THIS WE HAVE PASSED OFF OF THIS FLOOR OR OTHER INNOVATIVE HOUSING OPTIONS. WELL HOUSING SUPPLY IS CRUCIAL CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CRISIS IS MORE IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST SUPPLY IT'S ABOUT PREVENTING MORE FOLKS FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING RENTERS. THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE MONTHLY COST OF RENT FOR AN APARTMENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS INCREASED ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS 34% IN ORANGE OUNTY AVERAGE MONTHLY RENT INCREASED IN FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE RENT IS INCREASED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX DOLLARS MY OWN STAFF TELL ME THAT FIVE YEARS AGO HERE IN SACRAMENTO THEY PAID A THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH. FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT TODAY THAT SAME TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN SACRAMENTO HER COSTS ARE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AS RENTS HAVE RISEN RENTERS INCOMES HAVE TO OF NOT KEPT PACE DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF THIS BODY THE OTHER HOUSE AND THE GOVERNOR TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR CALIFORNIA'S ACROSS THE STATE BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. THE SAD REALITY IS THAT THE COST OF THE FAIR HOUSING RENT FAIR MARKET RENT. FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA WOULD REQUIRE A SALARY OF MORE THAN TWICE MORE THAN TWICE MEMBERS THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT IS WHY A MAJORITY OF RENTERS ARE SPENDING MORE THAN HALF. OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. AND ACCORDING TO OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MEMBERS HOUSEHOLDS ARE CONSIDERED RENT TO BURDEN. IF THEY SPEND OVER HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON RENT. OUR CA ARE LA FOUND THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS AND OVER 80% I STRESS OVER 80% OF EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RENTERS ARE RED BURDEN. EXTRAORDINARY THINK ABOUT THAT HOW MANY HOUSEHOLDS ARE SPENDING MOST OF THEIR INCOME JUST TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IT IS TRUE WHEN THEY SAY THE RENT IS JUST TOO HIGH. NOT ONLY IS IT HIGH BUT ONLY A HUNT ONLY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION AS THE PROBE. FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA IS THE PRO TEM SAID OUT OF SIX MILLION MULTI FAMILY HOUSING UNITS ARE PROTECTED BY SOME FORM OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL. THAT MEANS MEMBERS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE VULNERABLE TO EXCESS RENT INCREASES OR VACATION WITHOUT COST. MANY FRAGILE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE. LARGE RENT INCREASES CAN BE THE TIPPING POINT THAT PUSHES THEM AS I SUGGESTED FROM HOUSE THE HOMELESS THIS MEASURE OFFERS CRITICAL STEPS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS THIS BILL WILL DO THE FOLLOWING ONE AS WAS INDICATED ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE RENT CAP THAT IS BOTH PROTECTIVE FOR TENANTS. IN FAIR FOR LANDLORDS IMPORTANTLY THE CAP EXAMS HOUSING CONSTRUCTED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SO WE DON'T COUNTERACT EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AS THE PRO TEM INDICATED. AND THIS MEASURE PREVENT ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS EVICTIONS BY REQUIRING THE TENANTS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE UNIT FOR A YEAR OR MORE CAN ONLY BE EVICTED FOR JUST BECAUSE- IT ALSO REQUIRES LOCATION TO BE ASSISTANCE WITH THAT WHEN THE TENET MUST BE EVICTED. AT NO FAULT OF HIS OR HER OWN. THIS MEASURES THE KIND OF CAREFULLY BALANCED. MEASURE THE DOES THIS LEGISLATURE. AND OUR GOVERNOR PROUD. AND FOR A MOMENT MATTER PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY DEDICATION ON THIS ISSUE. FOR HIS LEGISLATIVE SECRETARY ANTHONY WILLIAMS A ROCKSTAR. AND FOR THE LONG HOURS HE'S PUT IN AND MEETING AFTER MEETING AND SEEING THIS THROUGH. MOST IMPORTANTLY TO OUR PRO TEM WHICH MADE THIS A TOP PRIORITY AND I KNOW. WE DON'T LIKE TO SAY THIS BUT FOR CHIEF OF STAFF MCCARTY MEN WHO IS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS WORKING HARD. FOR US AND WHO DID SO MUCH TO MAKE THIS MEASURE. COME TO EXISTENCE I ALSO WANT TO DEEPLY APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERSHIP IS THE PRO TEM SUGGESED WITH OUR ASSEMBLY COUNTERPARTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND TIM GRAYSON WHAT THE OTHER PART OF THE BILL. BOTH TENDED ADVOCACY GROUPS AND BUSINESS LEADERS RECOGNIZE THAT THIS MEASURE. OFFERS BOTH PROTECTIONS FOR RENTERS IN FAIRNESS AND STABILITY FOR LANDLORDS. ON THAT NOTE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE THE ROLE HOUSING PROJECT ANOTHER TENANTS RIGHTS GROUPS WHO FOUGHT SO TIRELESSLY TO MAKE THIS TO BRING THIS MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY FOR A VOTE. PRO TEM INDICATED TODAY'S AN IMPORTANT DAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT AND ASK YOU TO VOTE FOR A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR STONE. THEY GIVE IT A PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES. WHEN A WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH. I RISE IN OPPOSITION AB FOURTEEN THE TO A BILL THAT ONE ACT THE MOST SEVERE STATEWIDE RUN CONTROL MEASURE OUR STATE HAS EVER SEEN. WE TALK ABOUT A TEN YEAR SUNSET. MY FRIENDS IN TEN YEARS MOST OF US WON'T BE HERE ANYMORE IN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S JUST LIKE A TAX. WE LABEL TAXES THIS TEMPORARY TAXES BUT THEY ALWAYS BECOME PERMANENT TAXES THIS 5% IS GOING TO BE THE FLOOR NOT THE CEILING TO RENT CONTROL IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I IN THE MANY YEARS TO COME. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE BIGGER BUSINESS GROUPS THAT WERE MENTIONED IF PARMON SOCIAIS SHIN AND OTHER SPECIAL INTERESTS HAVE CUT A DEAL. TO EXAMINE THEIR HOUSING UNITS FROM THIS THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WE JUST SEEM TO ONE EXEMPT SOME OF THE BIGGER PLAYERS SO THAT WE DON'T GET THE OPPOSITION SO WE CAN SAY WE DID SOMETHING THIS RIGHTEOUS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU KNOW THESE THESE BIGGER COMPANIES THAT OWN HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS APARTMENTS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALGORITHMS AND THEY CAN SPREAD COSTS AND HAVE FEES AT THE SMALLER LANDLORDS. DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW SUCH AS A POOL FEE A SECURITY FEE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEE UP TAFFY THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR RENT INCREASES AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY. AND BUT BUT BECAUSE W HAVE THE FIFTEEN YEAR TIME PERIOD THAT THEY'RE EXEMPT FROM THIS IT'S STILL IS GOING TO HAVE A IN THE IMPACT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE AS A LOOK TO CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN WHICH I'M GONNA GET TO A LITTLE BIT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SMALL. APARTMENT OWNER WHO WORK THEIR WHOLE LIFE TO GRAB A FEW BUCKS THEY GET IN A PLAQUE SIR TWELVE PLEX ANY UNIT THE MAYBE TWENTY YEARS OR OR OLDER I'M REMINDED OF A STORY ABOUT SOME HARD WORKING ASIAN PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT SOLD DONUTS AND- WORKED HARD AS A FAMILY WERE ABLE TO BUY TWO OR THREE HOMES AND- IN SAN FRANCISCO INNER ARE ABLE TO HAVE SOME PASSIVE INCOME THAT THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO RETIREMENT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF THEY PUT THEIR THEIR ASSETS IN THE C. CORP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LEGISLATION I GUESS THE SMALL APARTMENT OWNER JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH JUICE. TO CUT THEIR OWN DEALS GET ACCEPTED YET. LOOK WHAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK FOR TO. EVERY YEAR IS PROPERTY VALUES GO UP. OUR SISTER. RAISES THE VALUE OF THOSE THE PROPERTIES BUT UNDER PROP THIRTEEN WHICH WE KNOW IS UNDER ASSAULT THE CITY CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE AROUND FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG HOW MUCH LONGER. BUT THEY CAN MANDATORILY INCREASE THE PROPERTY TAXES BY 2% PER YEAR. SOME INVESTORS INVEST IN AND CONDO TOWNHOME DEVELOPMENTS HOV FEES RARELY GO DOWN THEY USUALLY GO UP. AND THEN OF COURSE IF YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AS A FRIEND OF MINE PETER. WHO. CAME HERE AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM HUNGRY WHEN HE WAS TWO YEARS OLD AND HIS PARENTS DIDN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE BECAME NATURALIZED AND GOT INTO THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS AND- WORK THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND ENDED UP GETTING FOURTEEN UNITS IN BRENTWOOD. WHICH IS A PRETTY. YOU KNOW. HI COST AREA. AND HIS PARENTS RECENTLY IN THE PAST DECADE BOTH PASSED AWAY IN HERE THOSE PROPERTIES IN. THE CITY OF LA NOW IS REQUIRING HIM TO. EARTHQUAKE RETROFIT THESE UNITS. ANY SIGNIFICANT COSTS. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. M. BY ENACTING A 5% CAP. HE'LL PROBABLY EXPIRE HIMSELF BEFORE HE EVER GETS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITH THESE THROW EARTHQUAKE RETROFITS. IN LOS ANGELES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BUT THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY. REJECTED RENT CONTROL. RECENTLY. JUST LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIANS VOTED NO ON PROP TEN WHICH FAILED NOT BY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS MY FRIENDS IFILL BY NINETEEN POINTS. I GUESS THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST FOLLOWING THE GOVERNOR'S LEAD AND IGNORING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. FIRST IT WAS A DEATH PENALTY. NOW IT'S RENT CONTROL. THE PEOPLE OF SPOKEN AND WE ARE IGNORING THAT AND BELIEVE ME THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION. THAT DOESN'T SOMEONE DEMOCRACY TO ME BUT I'M GETTING USED TO THAT PRACTICE IN THIS BUILDING. WITH THIS GOVERNOR. AND THIS LEGISLATURE. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL ALSO CREATE MAJOR HOUSING MARKET INSTABILITY WHICH WILL ONLY PERPETUATE OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS EVEN MORE. MAYBE WE SHOULD LEARN FROM LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES. MIKE ORGAN WHO VOTED IN A RENT CONTROL. MEASURE THREE MONTHS AGO. ALREADY IN THE STATE OF OREGON THERE'S BEEN A 38% DECREASE IN MULTI FAMILY INVESTMENT IS THAT WHAT WE WANT CALIFORNIA'S A DECREASE INVESTMENT IN MULTI FAMILY INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY BY THE BIG PLAYERS SO WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND YOU ALL KNOW THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND EQUATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SUPPLY. THE RICH ARE GOING TO GO UP. WE'RE GONNA GO ESPECIALLY IN THE NEWER UNITS THERE ARE TO BE EVEN MORE ON AFFORDABLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE MANDATES THAT THIS. IS A TO SHIP PLACES ON ON BUILDERS. HOUSING INVESTORS AND DEVELOPERS ARE NOT STUPID PEOPLE THEY KNOW THAT RENT CONTROL PROVIDES NO MARKET STABILITY AND WHO WOULD RESTORE MONEY TIME AND INVESTMENT ON INSTABILITY. WHEN CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THEY CAN GO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEIR INVESTMENTS HAMSTRING ARE HAMSTRUNG THE WAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO DO THAT. MAYBE OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO MOVE TO TEXAS TO ARIZONA. THE FLORIDA. IDAHO TO NEVADA. FOR TENNESSEE AND THAT'S JUST OUR RHETORIC THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THOSE STATES HAVE SEEN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS BUILT. BUT CALIFORNIA'S ONLY SEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND. UNITY INCREASE. DO YOU USE THE NUMBER OF UNITS BUILT MY FRIENDS IF YOU PASS THIS MEASURE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL ONLY DECREASE IF RENT CONTROL IS ENACTED WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA WE'LL SEE EVEN A GREATER HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE OF THE LOW SUPPLY OF HOUSING EITHER THIS WILL FORCE OUR CONSTITUENTS TO JOIN SIXTY THOUSAND HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE SEE IN THE LA AREA ALTHOUGH SIMPLY JUST MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE. IF WE REALLY WANT TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS AND PROTECT EXISTING AND FUTURE TENANTS WE MUST PASS LEGISLATION THAT ENCOURAGES HOUSING INVESTMENT AND PROVIDES HOUSING CHOICE BY REMOVING BARRIERS SO THAT DEVELOPERS CAN BUY LAND AND CAN BUILD AND STOP OVER IMPORTING THEM WITH INTEREST RATES PLACE SINCE THAT TRANSLATE INTO HIGHER COSTS THAT HAVE TO BE PASSED ON. TO RENTERS. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT HOUSING. SLOW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND LIMIT TENANTS ABILITY TO FIND HOMES. MY FRIENDS. I KNOW IT. GOOD TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE RENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALL DO. BUT THERE'S A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT IN A WRONG WAY TO DO IT LIMITING THE SUPPLY AND LIMITED THE INVESTMENT IN PROVIDING THE SAME IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH. WE LEARNED THAT IN THE NEXT ONE ONE. I CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN A PROUD INVESTOR IN REAL ESTATE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT I'M GOOD I'M IN GOOD SHAPE. MANY OF MY FAMILY. MEMBERS HAVE PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE. BUT THERE ARE MANY IN CALIFORNIA THE WEREN'T AWARE. THAT THIS TRAIN WAS GOING TO BE LEAVING THE STATION HEARD IN THEIR ABILITY TO. ENJOY THEIR INVESTMENTS ESPECIALLY ARE RETIRED FOLKS THAT WORK THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF SAVINGS TO BUY A FEW DWELLING UNITS SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE IN THEIR RETIREMENT. THEY STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN THESE UNITS THAT ARE OLDER. THE PLUMBING GOES OUT THE AIR CONDITIONING GOES OUT THE HEATING GOES OUT. THESE THESE EXPENDITURES ARE NOT CHEAP THEY'RE EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY WITH OLDER UNITS. SO IF YOU HAVE A CAP OF 5% ON A UNIT IS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OLD MY UNCLE OWNS SOME UNITS IN GLENDALE CALIFORNIA THE PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST TIME YOU HAVE TO KIND OF REBUILD THESE UNITS AGAIN TO MAKE THEM HAPPY DOUBLE SO THE PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THEIR HOMES BUT THAT COSTS MONEY WELL IF THEY CAN'T GET A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO VESTED THESE UNITS AND MAKE THEM MY SON HABITABLE. I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO WE'RE GOING TO CREATE SUB STANDARD LIVING CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING AT THE BORDERLINE OF BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS HOUSING CRISIS IT IS VERY MUCH. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICIES THE COME OUT OF THIS INSTITUTION. WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER JOB OF REDUCING COSTS. AND THAT'S HAVE COMPETITION. AMONGST LANDLORDS THERE'S NO NOT MUCH COMPETITION NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T. MADE IT. EASY FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T HAVE COMPETITION. THIS IS WHAT THE RESULT IS. AND SO WHAT'S THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTION. LET'S JUST CAP THE INCOME THAT THESE ENTREPRENEURS ARE ENTITLED TO MAKE. IT THE WRONG WAY TO DO IT YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY SOMETHING WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT. AND WHEN YOU INCREASES APPLY. MANY OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO COMPETE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO COMPETE IN A ROW WHY IS HEY AND THAT'S HOW I GOT A LOWER RENTS. AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA MAKE. PROPERTIES AWFUL WE HAVE A BILL DO WILLING IS FOR PEOPLE TO GET BY. MY FRIENDS THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE DO THIS NOTE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IT FEELS GOOD. BUT IT'S GOING TO HER A LOT OF PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU PASS THIS ORIGINAL VOTED AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. AS IT HAS BEEN SAID BY NUMBERS SPEAKERS EARLIER. A SEVERE SHOULD SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND CALIFORNIA'S IS CAUSING RENTS TO RISE TO LEVELS THAT ARE NO LONGER AFFORDABLE FOR A LARGE SHARE OF OUR POPULATION. HI THIS BILL PROMISES TO SLOW THOSE INCREASES AND PREVENT ON JUST ADDICTIONS. BUT IN MY VIEW RENT CONTROL IS NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. WHILE IT MAY BE NEEDED IN AN EMERGENCY. IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS WORSE OVER THE LONG RUN. RED CONTROL ALMOST BY DEFINITION MAKES THE THINGS WE NEED MOST CONSTRUCTION OF NEW RENTAL HOUSING LESS LIKELY. AND IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE. ANYTIME YOU REDUCE THE RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT YOU MAKE THAT INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE. AND THIS IS TRUE EVEN IF NEW INVESTMENT IS ACCEPTED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HAS THIS BILL DOES. RED CAN WROTECONTROL CAN LEAD TO THE REDUCTION IN THE EXISTING RENTAL SUPPLY. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL FOUND THAT AFTER. SAN FRANCISCO ADOPTED RENT CONTROL IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. LANDLORDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONVERT THEIR APARTMENTS TWO CONDOS. OR NOT IS THERE TENANTS OUT BY SPENDING LESS ON MAINTENANCE. OTHERS MOVED INTO THE RENTAL UNITS THEMSELVES ARE RENTED TO FAMILY MEMBERS. AND AT A TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE TARGETING OUR SOLUTIONS TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. CONTROL HELPS THE MILLIONAIRE AND A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR A MONTH UNIT EVEN MORE THAN IT HELPS THE SINGLE MOM. AND A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR. A MONTH FLAT. A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO HELP POOR RANCHERS. IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT REDUCE SUPPLY. IS TO GIVE THOSE RENTERS GRANTS OR TAX CREDITS TO HELP THEM PAY THE RENT. WE DO THIS IN HEALTHCARE. AND WE DO THIS WITH FOOD. WE SHOULD DO MORE OF IT WITH HOUSING. THE SENATE HAS PASSED MY LEGISLATION TO CATCH THE RENTER'S CREDIT UP TO INFLATION AFTER HOLDEN FLAT FOR FORTY YEARS I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THAT MEASURE ALSO INCREASE THE CREDIT FOR. LOW INCOME SINGLE MOMS AND DADS. THAT BIPARTISAN IDEAS SHOULD BE A PART OF ANY PLANNED EIGHT RENTERS. BUT THAT BILL WAS HELD IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. I HOPE WE CAN REVISIT THIS WERE THE PLAN NEXT YEAR. THE ASSEMBLY ALSO BLOCKED COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION TO GIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SAME RELIEF FROM SYKORA. FROM SEQUEL LITIGATION THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S GIVEN THE BUILDERS OF SPORTS STADIUMS AND ARENAS. SO WHILE RENT CAPS IN THIS BILL MAY PROVIDE SOME SHORT TERM RELIEF TO THOSE WHO HAVE A RENTAL UNIT TODAY. WE MUST DO MORE TO HELP LOW INCOME RENTERS AND THAT MEANS INCREASING THE SUPPLY INCREASING THE SUPPLY THE RENT IS NOT JUST CAPITA COMES DOWN OVER TIME AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION UNDERSTANDS THAT AND AGREES WITH THAT THAT DESIRE TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE FACTOID IN A CLOSE. ACCORDING TO THE- CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC FORUM THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPROVED HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THAT'S RIGHT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND APPROVED HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WITH THE ROBUST CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE THAT'S PROBABLY A THREE YEAR SUPPLY. AND SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WHY WHY AREN'T PEOPLE BUILDING. RENTS ARE GOING OUT PEOPLE MAKING MONEY ALLEGEDLY. SO WHY ARE WE ABLE TO BORROW WHY ISN'T THAT. CAPITAL BEING INVESTED IN CONSTRUCTION AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COMPLEX ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. WHETHER IT'S FEES. WHETHER IT'S AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES AND COST OF LABOR THERE'S A LOT TO THAT AND IT'S COMPLEX AND WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO WORK ON IT. IT HAS LITTLE TO DO. WITH NIMBY ISM THAT SAYING NO TO CONSTRUCTION AS WE DEBATE A LOT ON THE FLOOR IN THAT AREA. NEVER THE LESS THE ACUTE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LARGE RENT INCREASES. IS A CRISIS THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE. ALTHOUGH FLAWED AND SHORT TERM IN ITS BENEFITS THIS BILL. PUTS A TEMPORARY BANDAID AGAINST RENT GALGIANI. AND ACCORDINGLY I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MORALE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. I'M NOT GETTING OUT A WHOLE LOT I REALLY APPRECIATE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM AROUND AS WELL AS A SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE ON THIS I THINK THEY CLEARLY ARTICULATED VERY IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THIS IS A VIOLATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS YOU KNOW PERSON WORKS WATSON TOILS AND THEY MAKE A LITTLE MONEY THEN THEY INVEST IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING IN OUR HOUSE AND GOVERNMENT OVER REGULATES THAT THAT'S DISTURBING TAMMY. BUT HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT I JUST WANT TO HEAR I USED TO HAVE A REAL ESTATE COMPANY AND THEN I WAS ON THE BE I A BOARD THE BILLING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SO I KNOW PEOPLE IN REAL ESTATE I I'VE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF BUILDERS AND WE STILL ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT MANAGES PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS IN ARIZONA. AND MY CONCERN YOU KNOW BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER SO I KNOW A LOT OF BUILDERS REAL LITTERS AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN THE LANDLORD BUSINESS RENTAL HOUSING AND. THE ARK SKIPPING MANY OF THEM WERE VERY CONCERNED. PLACE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATION AND SELL. MANY OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE LEFT CALIFORNIA'S. MY FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE AS WELL AS I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY MORE WHO ARE CONSIDERING DOING THE SAME THING. BECAUSE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE A GOOD INVESTMENT. IN CALIFORNIA ON OUR PART AND BILLING RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE RENT CONTROL IN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT DEBTS THIS REALLY TOUGH. IS REPAIRS AND CITIES LIKE DETROIT WHERE YOU DO HAVE STRICT RENT CONTROL THERE'S THIRTY NINE THOUSAND VACANT HOMES FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. IN THE CITY OF DETROIT WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME LIKE TROY BUT SADLY PERHAPS WE WILL BECAUSE- FOR LANDLORDS MAKE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. IT'S VERY TOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY. HOUSING REPAIR SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MINOR THINGS BUT WHEN THAT AIR CONDITIONING HEATING BREAKS THEY COULD BE FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN CIVIL WITH RENT CONTROL QUITE OFTEN YOU SEE THAT THEIR CONDITIONS OF THE PROPERTY WELL CERTAINLY. AND SO AGAIN I THINK. I AM THE FREE MARKET SHOULD ROLL IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE VOTERS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO PROTECT HOUSING HAND WE SHOULD DO WHAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE VOTED ON AND SO FOR THAT REASON I AM A NO BUT BUT THE LONG TERM THINKING IS THIS WILL BE IF HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION MODERN HISTORY THIS WILL BE DEVASTATING TO OUR- OUR OUR STATE SO FAR IS AT WILL HAVE FEWER. PIECES OF PROPERTY BUT ALSO WILL HAVE CITIES THAT WILL DETERIORATE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE THAT COMES WITH RENT CONTROL AND YOU WON'T HAVE. THAT MANY INVESTORS WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR MONEY IN TO STATE THAT OVER REGULATE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU TO THE PRO TEM I STAND AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. EVERY CALIFORNIAN DESERVES A DECENT LIVING TANDARDS AND A SAFE AND STABLE HOME. I HAVE THE SECOND LARGEST OF THE DISTRICT WITH THE SECOND LARGEST HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF RENTERS IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA 44% OF RENTERS ARE RAISING FAMILIES. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING ECONOMIC EVICTIONS LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL THE SEVERELY OVER BURDENED. THE LARGEST GROWTH OF HOMELESS ARE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT ARE EVEN ACTED. WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES WE CAN NO LONGER ALLOW THE DEBATE TO BE IF AND WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU SIR DORADO SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS DISCUSSION WITH. THE POINT SAID IN PREVIOUSLY RAISED BUT IT OCCURRED TO ME. THAT. ALL OF US APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING EMERGENCY. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THINKS THAT WERE NOT. WE'VE HEARD IT FROM THE GOVERNOR WE DISCUSSED AD NAUSEAM A NUMBER OF ITEMS IT IN IN THE MEDIA THAT CALIFORNIA IS JUST NOT. OF IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY ITS PRESENT HOUSING NEEDS AND CERTAINLY NOT ITS FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS. WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW. AND I'VE GOING BACK TO MY LAW SCHOOL. EXPERIENCE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN EVENTS LIKE EMERGENCIES. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S HABEAS CORPUS OR. WE HAVE MARTIAL LAW FOR. EMERGENCY NATURAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS THESE ARE ALL IDENTIFIED AS TEMPORARY BUT IMPORTANT GESTURES TO ACHIEVE STABILITY FOR SECURITY OR SAFETY. AND I THINK IF SINCE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING EMERGENCY. I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT IF THIS LEGISLATION. HAD SOME SAFETY VALVES IN IT MORE SO THAN EXIST RIGHT NOW. IN ONE OF THEM WOULD BE IN A TEN YEAR WINDOW FOR SOMETHING THAT I THINK ECONOMISTS AND FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE AMPLE DEBATE ON. MAY PERHAPS A FIVE YEAR WINDOW INSTEAD OF ITS CURRENT EXPLORATION AT TWENTY THIRTY. HOW ABOUT AN ANNUAL REVIEW ON WHERE OUR HOUSING STOCK IS GOING AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS ACTUALLY GAINING TRACTION. IN ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT NEEDING SO DESPERATELY IN OUR STATE. I THINK THAT COULD MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVEN THOUGH I'M- PHILOSOPHICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY OF THE OPINION THAT RENT CONTROL IS NOT GOING TO GIVE US WHAT WE NEED. I THINK WE KNOW THAT THE VOTE COUNT IN THE POLITICAL SUPPORT WILL BRING THIS TO REALITY. BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MADE BETTER FOR AT LEAST MORE ACCOUNTABLE IF WE HAD SOME SAFETY VALVES INCORPORATED INTO THIS MORE THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. I CAN ONLY OFFER THAT IS A RESPECTFUL RECOMMENDATION BUT JUST TO REITERATE. INSTEAD OF IT BEING AT TWENTY THIRTY MAKE IT FIVE YEARS. AND REQUIRE. EXPERTS WITHIN. THE RELEVANT FIELD TO REPORT BACK TO US ON WHETHER OR pTO THE WE DON'T LET TOO MUCH TIME EXPIRE BEFORE RE CORRECTING THE COURSE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS BAND THESE ARE THE TYPE OF DEBATES I THINKER I'VE RATHER WE DON'T DEBATE THIS IS THE TYPE OF DISCUSSIONS THAT I THINK ARE VERY VALUABLE ON OUR FLOOR. AND I NOTE THAT IT WAS EITHER TODAY OR MAYBE POSTED YESTERDAY ONLINE THE SACRAMENTO BEE ONCE AGAIN REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA'S POVERTY RATE ACCORDING TO NEW CENSUS BUREAU DATA IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. AND WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR COST OF LIVING. OUR POVERTY RATE IS ONLY EXCEEDED BY WASHINGTON DC. WE ARE IN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BUILT IN A FALLACY. AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU AND I HAVE BEEN DOING OUR BEST TO. FULLY GIVE A GREEN LIGHT TO GET MUCH MORE HOUSING AND TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT FOR NOW DECADES WE DID NOT BUILD ENOUGH BUT WE CAN NOT BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS FAST ENOUGH. AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE MORE IN MORE. WORKING. CALIFORNIANS FAMILIES REGULAR PEOPLE. WHO ARE BEING DISPLACED FROM THEIR RESIDENTS. IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. AND I USUALLY BUY PREVIOUSLY IN ACCURATELY SAID THERE WAS A 47% INCREASE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IT WAS ONLY 43% DON'T QUIBBLE. BUT FORTY 3% MORE PEOPLE RIGHT IN MY HOME TOWN AREA. OF OAKLAND BERKELEY EMERYVILLE AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS BECAME HOMELESS. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN THEY'RE ALL WORKING THEY'RE NOT ADDICTED THEY'RE NOT MENTALLY ILL THE CHEST FACE THAT SITUATION OF AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OR EIGHT ILLNESS OR THE LOSS OF A JOB OR SOMETHING THAT PUT HIM IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR MAYBE AN ILLEGAL EVICTION BUT NOT IN ALL CASES WHERE. THEY HAD TO LEAVE WHERE THEY LIVED AND THEY ARE NW IN THEIR ARS WERE ON COUCHES WERE IN THE STREET. I DON'T WANT ANYMORE TO BE DISPLACED MY HEART CAN'T TAKE IT. THIS BILL GIVES THOSE PEOPLE TEMPORARILY RID RELIEF TEN YEARS OF TEMPORARY RELIEF WHILE WE DO OUR BEST TO BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF IT. AND FOR MY. FOR THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE BECOME NEWLY HOMELESS. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND TO PREVENT. ADDITIONAL PEOPLE UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEM THIS TIDE WHAT WE DO OUR BEST TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF IT WITHOUT I ASKED ZERO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANKS FOR THE VALUABLE DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC. FOR ME MISDIAGNOSIS IS TOUGH. TO OBSERVE AND WATCH SO. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE TEMPORARY HOUSING SHORTAGE. COLLEAGUES THAT THE TWO WORDS RENT CONTROL FOR ME IS LIKE FINGERNAILS SCRATCHING ON A BLACKBOARD. BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT A 5% ANNUAL INCREASE PLUS CPI AS A CAP IS VERY VERY GENEROUS ESPECIALLY WHEN REPORT TENSION LATE AT THE TOP. OF A MARKET WAY TO GO. SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. HOW DO YOU PASS IT UP. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. BUT IF IT THIS INCENTIVIZE IS THE CREATION OF MORE NEW HOUSING WERE TOAST. MISDIAGNOSIS COULD BE. HAPPENING HERE AS A FREE MARKET PERSON THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR THE PROBLEM WE KNOW. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE POPULATION TRENDS. RECESSION ECONOMIC CYCLES AND THEN POTENTIALLY OVER BUILDING. AND THOSE ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CORRECT HOUSING DEMAND SO COLLEAGUES PATIENCE PATIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP SENATOR LABEL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MEMBERS WE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WE CANNOT AS A STATE AND AS A COUNTRY NOT HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE LOW POVERTY WAGES THAT THEY PAY WORKERS AND THEN SAY THAT THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT THAT THAT WEEK WE SHOULDN'T SOLVE. THE RENT PROBLEM. UNTIL WE DECIDE THAT WORKERS DESERVE A LIVING WAGE UNTIL WE DOES DECIDE THAT CORPORATIONS WHO MAKE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHOULD SHARE SOME OF THAT WITH THE WORKERS WHO PUSH THE MONEY UP TO THEM. THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM DO WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF COURSE WE HAVE HAD A HOUSING SHORTAGE. THAT WE KNOW HOW TO FIX BUT HOW DO WE FIX THE RENT AND HOW DO WE FIX. THAT PEOPLE CAN'T PAY THE RENT ONE OF THE WAYS IS THROUGH WAGES BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT WE ALLOW CORPORATIONS WHO HOLD MORE WEALTH THAN THEY'VE EVER HELD IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. TO CONTINUE TO BE GREEDY UNTIL WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE THEM FORCE THEM TO PAY LIVING WAGES THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. I'VE TOLD THIS STORY BEFORE BUT I'M GONNA TELL IT AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I RAN FOR OFFICE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND GOT MARRIED WE MADE TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THAT BARELY MAKE THAT AND THE ONLY REASON THEY DO IS BECAUSE WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE CORPORATIONS WOULDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING. WE MADE TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WE BOUGHT A HOUSE. THIS WAS. NINE NINE. IN DOLLARS EIGHT TOURISTS THE TWO. AS AN GAS WAS NINETY TWO CENTS A GALLON FAST OVER THIRTY YEARS THAT HOUSE IS WORTH FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS RELEASE IS SELLING FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GAS IS ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON EXIT THREE TO SIX DOLLARS A DOZEN WHAT SHOULD THAT GROCERY CLERK THAT WAS MAKING TWELVE DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT BE MAKING IF IT'S GOING TO KEEP UP WITH. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GONE UP AROUND THEM. FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TO ME FOR EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR WHAT DOES THAT GROCERY WORKER MAKE TODAY. TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LET EVERYTHING RISE AROUND US EXCEPT REAL WAGES. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO FIX THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. BUT I THINK THE FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO GOES A LONG WAY AND PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR HELP. THINGS COME TO THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING. PEOPLE DON'T DO THE RIGHT THING AND WERE FORCED TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO I'M HAPPY TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND DO A LITTLE PART. ARE PART IN HELPING PEOPLE REMAIN IN THEIR APARTMENT. IN THEIR RENTAL HOME. WE CAN'T SEE MORE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WE CAN'T WE CAN'T BE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS. ISN'T THAT AWFUL THAT WERE THINKING ABOUT THAT. SO UNTIL WE DECIDE THAT WE WANT OF WORLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAY LIVING WAGES. THIS IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO FOR PEOPLE I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT ARE PRESENT LADIES GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. AS IT LISTEN TO THIS DEBATE. I'M REMINDED OF HOW MANY YEARS I'VE LISTENED TO THIS SAME DEBATE. QUITE A LONG TIME. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN TINKERED WITH. MORE OFTEN MADE WORSE. BY OWNERS STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. EVEN ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS OF COMPLAINT. IN TESTIMONY. THE COST OF HOUSING FOR THE HOME LAST THAT THEY WANT TO BE ADVOCATING FOR IN SECURING HOUSING FOR. SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSE TO BUILD THAT WILL THOSE HOMES THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE OF STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY SINCERELY FROM THEIR HEARTS AND PASSIONATELY WANT TO SECURE HOUSING. IT IS AFFECTED MY OWN FAMILY. ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS AND HER HUSBAND AND HER TWO GRANDSONS. HAVE MOVED TO ANOTHER STATE. LAST MONTH. AFTER MANY YEARS SETTLING IN A BAY AREA COUNTY. WITH VERY GOOD JOBS THAT HIGH RANKING U. S. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE RANGERS. THEY CONCLUDED THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE A HOME. OF THEIR OWN. IN CALIFORNIA. SO THEY. LIKE IN RAND'S BOOK ATLAS SHRUGGED. THEY'VE GONE. THEY FOUND ANOTHER PLACE ALREADY. HOME GREATER THAN THE ONE THAT THEY WERE READING. AND MUCH LESS COST TO THEM THE BY THEN WAS FOR THEM IN THAT AREA. I GUESS WE SORT OF DESERVE WHAT WE GET AND COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. OVER THESE DECADES. HAS NOT ACHIEVED VERY MUCH. MAYBE ANY EFFORT IS WELL WORTH IT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND EVEN THE QUOTE DEAL. DOES NOT TAKE US VERY FAR DOWN THE PATH. WE ALSO THEN HAVE ISSUES SUCH AS OUR FIRE IN PARADISE WHERE THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS. ACTIVELY SEEKING TO DE POPULATE THESE AREAS ANOTHER DO NOT REBUILT. WE DON'T WANT YOU. TO STAY LIVING HERE. THE CALIFORNIA. IN PARADISE IN BUTTE COUNTY. THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER. AN ANSWER CERTAINLY IS SUPPLY. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LOT MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE ENHANCE AND EXPAND. SUPPLY. THE REGULATORY RELIEF IN PART. BY DOING THINGS THAT PROVIDE MORE JOBS TO CALIFORNIANS. SO THEY CAN AFFORD TO BUY. BUT NOT WITHOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION BEING HANDLED AND THAT IS THE COSTS. OF THAT HOUSING ITSELF. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS MAY BE A STEP. BUT I THINK IT COULD BE SAFELY ASSURED. IN FIVE YEARS. WE'LL BE HAVING EXACTLY THE SAME DEBATE HERE. AND THIS REMEDY. WE'LL HAVE BEEN PERICA BEST. AND MORE PEOPLE WILL HAVE LEFT CALIFORNIA. AND FEWER. OF OUR FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY. WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND RAISED. THAT'S A SAD COMMENTARY ABOUT A GREAT STATE. I URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS BEEN A REALLY INTRIGUING THOUGHTFUL DEBATE AND AS I SAID HER LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES I SAID I. REALIZE THAT I HATE HATE HATE TO ADMIT. BUT I AM OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT MY PARENTS PAID ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE MARK PARK. EITHER I'M REALLY REALLY OLD OR THE RENT CAR ROCKETED IN A VERY. FEW YEARS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT OLD. AND WE ALL ARE CLEAR THAT WE HAVEN'T BILL TODAY WE ARE ALL CLEAR THAT OUR POPULATION HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY. BUT YOU KNOW I WORRY ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I REPRESENT BALL ONE VILLAGE IN LOS ANGELES CITY COUNTY ONE OF THE AREAS THAT MR AMERICA pCALIFORNIA. BUILT ON A AND DESIGNED A HIGH END APARTMENT COMMUNITY HI IT'S AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE. AND IT WAS KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE BECAUSE HE IMPORTED TROPICAL PLANTS AND FOR ALLEGE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. EVERY APARTMENT BUILDING HAD SWIMMING POOLS WE WERE WALKING CLOSETS AND IT WAS HIGH LIVIN AS MY FATHER WOULD SAY IN LOS ANGELES. ALL THOSE APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM IN THIS COMMUNITY WERE BUILT MANY OF THEM ON STILTS WITH THE PARKING UNDERNEATH. YOU KNOW IN THE FIFTIES. AND I WORRY ABOUT SEISMIC SAFETY I KNOW A NUMBER OF THOSE APARTMENT OWNERS IN THAT COMMUNITY THEY WERE MY PARENTS PEERS AND I WORRY THAT IF THE WIND THE NEXT BIG ONE COMES A LOS ANGELES AND BALLING. IT IS HOME TO THOUSANDS OF ANGELENOS. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS INTO THIS DEBATE I'M REMINDED THAT PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IS VERY SIMILAR TO RUNNING A BUSINESS AND THE DEBATE IS SIMILAR ON THIS FLOOR. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE. TRYING TO BRING A CLOSER TO A LIVABLE WAGE IN CALIFORNIA WE HEARD THE BUSINESSES COULDN'T AFFORD AND THEY WOULD GO OUT OF TOWN THEY WOULD BUT LEAVE THE STATE. WELL THE SAME APPLY PROPERTY OWNERS WHO RELY ON RENTAL INCOME. TO MAKE A PROFIT TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE A COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY MEMBERS THAT OWN PROPERTY THAT'S FIFTY YEARS OLD WELL YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IF YOU OWN PROPERTY FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS OF WHAT EVER WRITTEN YOU'RE EARNING THIS PROBABLY TURNING A PROFIT FOR YOU. SO MUCH LIKE THE BUSINESSES THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CREATE A SENSE OF BALANCE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO STOP I'M NOT TRYING TO START BUSINESSES FOR MAKING A PROFIT. BUT ON THE BACKS OF. AND CREATING THE SENSE OF BALANCE. BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL WHENTHEY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL EMPLOYEES WELL TRAINED. HAPPY EMPLOYEES THAT DELIVER HIGH QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT INCREASE THE PROPERTY ON YOUR BUSINESS. PROPERTY OWNERS RELY ON RENTER'S BEING ABLE TO AFFORD YOUR RENT OR YOU WILL HAVE IN THE UNITS PHILLIPS IT'S NOT A US VERSUS THEM IT'S A WEAK SCENARIO. AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD THE CALIFORNIA THAT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO BE HOUSED IN. OUR COLLEAGUE SAID THAT OVER TIME THE WE'VE TINKERED AROUND THIS ISSUE FOR A WHILE IT'S PROBABLY RIGHT. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR PERHAPS. THAT WE STOP TINKERING AND ENGAGE IN SOME RADICAL THINKING A RADICAL CHANGE. BECAUSE WE ARE EXPERIENCING. LIVING CONDITIONS IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE THAT REQUIRES RADICAL ACTION ON OUR PART. WE WATCHED AREAS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN STATE THAT PERHAPS. PROPERTY IS LOWER THAT HAVE LESS REGULATION AND DON'T HAVE THIS ONEROUS ZONING REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE ARE ALSO AREAS THAT I'VE SEEN TEXAS BEING ONCE THEY OR WE THOUGHT MASS DEVASTATION. WHERE WE LEARNED THAT PROPERTY LIFE WAS LOST IN PROPERTY WAS LOST BECAUSE OF A LACK OF REGULATION AND A LACK OF ADHERENCE TO A ZONING PERSPECTIVE. WE LIVE IN EARTHQUAKE WE LIVE IN FIRE COUNTRY AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF NOT BEING THOUGHTFUL AND DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD HOUSING AND STRUCTURES THAT WILL PROTECT LIVES. AND CAN BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. IS THE PER UNIT COST FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO HIGH ABSOLUTELY DOES IT VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE YES. AND SO THOSE ARE ALL PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE TAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEBATE AND COME TO A CONCLUSION AND HOW WE MANAGE IT AND A HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE WAY. TO CREATE TO CONTINUE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT SUCH THAT VIRTUALLY NO ONE ARE ONLY THE CO AUTHOR OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND WILL BE SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND WHAT I WOULD JUST CHALLENGE ALL OF US TO THINK IS BECAUSE WE HAVE COLLEAGUES TO WAX FOR ELOQUENTLY ON THIS FLOOR. TO GET TO A CONCLUSION OF A NO VOTE. AND SO IF WE CONTINUE TO SAY NO. TO THESE CHRONIC. SITUATIONS THAT WE ALL FIND OURSELVES IN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY YES TO ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TINKER OR CONTINUE TO DEBATE OR WAX FOURTH ELOQUENT ON PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTIONS AND BRING NOTHING TO THE TABLE AS A SOLUTION THAT'S NOT HELPFUL TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE MINE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I AM PROUD TODAY TO VOTE FOR A SOLUTION AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MADAM PRO TEM. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW LET ME. BEFORE I GET SERIES LET ME JUST A KNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN HILLS AND TELL HER I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER HER QUESTION. BUT I AM GOING TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES SHE HAD A BIRTHDAY ON SATURDAY AND I'M SO SORRY. WE FORGOT TO WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION HOWEVER. ON A SERIOUS NOTE. LOOK I APPRECIATE. THE VIGOROUS DISCUSSION THIS DISCUSSION WE HAVE HAD. AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM I WAS IN HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. WHEN YOU WORK BUT I WOULD SAY. OF THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED. ISSUE IN TERMS OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE DECADES WE HAVE REDUCED AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION WE HAVE WE KNOW THAT IT TOOK US TEN TO TWENTY TO ALMOST THIRTY YEARS TO WORK OURSELVES INTO THIS DILEMMA. THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES THAT ARE ADVANCING LEGISLATION TO TRY TO IT DID ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION ISSUE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO OVER THERE A NUMBER OF OTHER COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE TRIED TO ADVANCE. OUR LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION SIDE AS WELL AS THE FUNDING SIDE MANY OF THE FUNDING ISSUES WE'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL ODD. SO WHERE ARE WE YOU KNOW I GOT HERE IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO BEGIN A TWENTY ELEVEN. SIZE WE BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK ON HOUSING AND I SAID WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL REALITIES IN THE CONSTRAINTS THAT EACH OF US FEEL FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME COMPLETELY ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. I WOULD SAY I'D- JUST A FEW POINTS. THE KID IN THE ISSUE TODAY WE ARE IN A CRISIS. AND IN STATE LAW THERE ARE ANTI GALGIANI. LAWS THAT ADDRESS WITH ALMOST ANY KIND OF NATURAL DISASTER AS AS I SAID. THERE ISN'T ONE THAT SORT OF FITS THIS MOLD. WE HAVE TO WORK TO FIND AN ANSWER TO ADDRESS THE MOST EGREGIOUS SITUATIONS SITUATIONS LIKE RENTERS WHO WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE HOSPITALS PEOPLE WITH GOOD CAREERS. CAREER SAID IF YOU KNOW WHERE I GREW UP IF I HAD A CAREER AS A NURSERY TEACHER. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN MAKING IT IN LIFE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING IT. SO HOW DO YOU HAVE A GOOD CAREER AND YOU'RE MAKING IT AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT. SO WHETHER IT'S IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE HOSPITAL SMALL BUSINESSES EMERGENCY SERVICES. THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED FROM AGREE JUST RENT INCREASES AND CAPRICIOUS EVICTIONS THAT COULD LEAD THEM HOMELESS WE'RE SEEING THAT HAPPEN. THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO APARTMENT OWNERS AND BUILDERS. ARE ACTUALLY NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AND THAT'S A REACTION OF A FOLLOW UP FROM THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES REFERENCED. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT BALLOT MEASURE. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOSE VERY PEOPLE OPPOSED CAME TO THE TABLE AND SAID LET'S KEEP HAMMERING OUT SOME SOLUTIONS HERE. THAT CAN GET US DOWN THE ROAD WHILE WE DEAL IN A DRESS IF WE CAN THE ISSUE OF PRODUCTION. FOR THE VERY PEOPLE OPPOSED ARE NOW NEUTRAL BECAUSE THEY'VE WEIGHED IN AND THEY'VE SAID. HERE'S WHAT WE THINK. AND SO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL OUT WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS HAS REALLY TRIED TO THREAD A VERY VERY. THEN NEEDLE. AND I JUST I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE RENT CONTROL THIS IS NOT RENT CONTROL. THIS IS. NOT RENT CONTROL IT IS A RENT CAP. IN CPI. COMBINED IN ORDER TO ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE THEIR INVESTMENT BE REAL. THEY'LL STILL BE ABLE TO PROFIT FROM THEIR INVESTMENTS AND MANAGE THEIR PROPERTIES SO IT'S NOT EVERY DAY WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET TEN IT GROUPS AND BUSINESS INTEREST TO COME TOGETHER TO COMPROMISE ON GETTING SOME SIGNIFICANT RELIEF TO RENTERS I DO WANT TO ADD MY THANKS TO SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO CAME VERY CLOSE TO NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR. BUT RAN OUT OF TIME. AND I HAVE TO THANK THE BILL'S AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. AND THOSE WHO'VE NEGOTIATED THE BILL FOR BRINGING THIS FINAL PRODUCT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN A PRIORITY TO ME FOR A LONG TIME. BUT I THINK YOU ALSO KNOW I'M NOT ONE TO STAND UP AND TAKE A LEAD ON EVERY BILL IN THIS HOUSE EVERY BILL THE A IT'S JUST NOT. WHAT I THINK MY JOB IS AS THE PRO TEM OF THE SENATE. BUT THIS BILL. IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- MANAGING AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. IS NECESSARY FOR US TO DO AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS NOW. TO ANSWER A COMMON OF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. THERE IS AN LA TEN YEAR REVIEW. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED FIVE YEARS OR SAID ELLIE TENURE REVIEW TO DETERMINE. WHAT WERE WE ABLE TO DO IN THE TIME. THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED FOR THE SUNSET. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO CHAIR. COMMITTEES HOUSING GOVERNMENT FINANCE OTHERS. AND THE VICE CHAIRS. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THIS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND TO HAVE THE NUMBERS COME FORWARD WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO KIND OF MONITOR THIS AS WE GO AND I WOULD URGE US. TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK. IT IS PART OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE ARE ARE. AND I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW THE MARKET DOES RESPOND TO THIS I SEE LOTS OF CRANES IN THE AIR IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO THAT I DIDN'T SEE. FIVE YEARS AGO. THE ISSUE IS THE MARKET IS HELPING US TO BUILD LUXURY CONDOS AND LUXURY APARTMENTS. AND THAT'S PART OF THE SUPPLY ISSUE BUT IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE OR LOW INCOME BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY WHAT IS AFFORDABLE TODAY. WE'RE HAVING TO PUT MONEY FORWARD TO SUBSIDIZE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD. THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. THAT WILL ALLOW US THE TIME. TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN POLICY AND BUDGET BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE'VE MENTIONED AND HEARD THE STORIES ABOUT THE ONES THAT KEEP MISS SKINNER AWAKE AT NIGHT. THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE WHICH IN SOME OF OUR CASES IS REALLY THEORETICAL WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE CONSTITUENTS UP AND DOWN OUR STATE. REGARDLESS NORTH SOUTH INLAND COASTAL OUT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE RESIDENTS TO TRY TO GIVE SOME RELIEF. TO TRY TO GET SOME RELIEF AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO SEE THIS THROUGH AND TO TAKE UP THOSE ISSUES THOSE OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THIS DILEMMA SO THAT WE BEGIN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE A GREAT STATE. BUT THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW THAT WILL IMPACT OUR ECONOMY IS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER EMPLOYEES HAVE HOUSING OR MY PLAYERS HAVE HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES WHETHER OUR RESIDENTS. WHETHER OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO LIVE HERE WHETHER OUR PARENTS ARE ABLE TO DOWNSIZE AND GET AN APPROPRIATELY SIZED.% APARTMENT OR CONDO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO THEIR THEIR LIVES AS WE AGE. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE ACTION AND- WITH GREAT APPRECIATION TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DIALOGUE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DEBATE THIS I KNOW BUT WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE THE SOLUTIONS. I SURE HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE PEOPLE HANGING IN THE BALANCE TODAY WHO NEED OUR HELP NOW I STRONGLY THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON A. B.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE NINETY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT CALLING FOR THE CHILD'S ABILITY TO HEAR SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED BY THEIR FAMILY INCOME YET HERE IN OUR STATE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S HEARING AIDS OUT OF POCKET. OR SIMPLY HAVE TO FOREGO THEM ALL TOGETHER. AB FIVE NINE EIGHT ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN COVERAGE BY REQUIRING HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS AND HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES TO INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN FEAR NAY. COVERAGE INCLUDES THE INITIAL HEARING ASSESSMENT NEW HEARING AIDS AT LEAST EVERY FOUR YEARS NEW EAR MALLS AND A NEW HEARING AID AT THE EXISTING ONE IS NO LONGER WORKING. THE COST OF THE HEARING AID IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BEER YOUR APPEARANCE OBTAINING PEDIATRIC HEARING AIDS THESE DEVICES FROM CASA DE SIX SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR A PAIR AND GROWING CHILDREN THE THESE DEVICES REPLACE FREQUENTLY. AB FIVE NINE EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR BACKGROUND HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS AND. HEARING AID SERVICES I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THIS IS OF EQUIPMENT WOULD BE COVERED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED T LEARN THAT. THEY WOULD BE EXCLUDED THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE COST OF HEARING DEVICES HAVE REALLY COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A PAIR. ACTIVE OF THE PRICE IS NO REASON WHY ANY CHILD THAT HAVE HEARING IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN THE STATE.

SENATOR SKINNER. FILE ITEM ONE THIRTY SEVEN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TEN NINETY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER AND ACTUALLY IN CHILD SUPPORT. SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. AB TEN NINETY TWO ELIMINATES THE INTEREST RATE THAT IS CHARGED TO. CHILD SUPPORT DEBT THAT IS BOWED TO THE STATE. RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY FIFTY DOLLARS OF A CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT GOES TO A FAMILY WHO IS ON ANY FORM OF BENEFITS THAT WE PROVIDE THE REMAINING BALANCE. IS TAKEN BACK AND PAID TO THE STATE FOR THE FAMILIES PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROGRAM. WHAT APPEARANCE FEELS TO MAKE A TIMELY CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS IN THIS IS NOT THE PARENT WHO'S ON THE BENEFIT PROGRAM THE CREW DEBT. AND CHARGE 10% INTEREST WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST RATES CHARGED ON CHILD SUPPORT IN THE NATION. THIS RESULTS IN THAT PERIOD BECOMING FURTHER AND FURTHER IN DEBT. AND FURTHER AND LITERALLY I'M ABLE TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT. WE WANT PARENTS TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT WE WANT THE CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT SUPPORT AND HELP THE FAMILY. BE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY SO WHAT THIS POLICY DOES IS HELP US. ENABLE THAT PARENTS TO. BETTER PAY THERE CHILD SUPPORT DEBTS. GETTING RID OF THEIR DEATHS SO THIS REQUIRES THE STATE TO CHARGE ZERO INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATORS SKINNER DEBATER DISCUSSION CENTERED DOLLY. THE MATTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO RISE ON THIS ISSUE WHO SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN EMPLOYER AND HAS TO HAVE HAD TO DO DOT FROM BY EMPLOYEES TO PAY THEIR. CHILD SUPPORT ON THEIR BEHALF BECAUSE THEY. WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE SO I ACTUALLY RISE IN OPPOSITION I KNOW THE 10% SEEMS LIKE IT'S HIGH BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DEADBEAT PARENTS BOTH SIDES. YOU CAN BE THE SPOUSE OR THE OR THE IT COULD BE THE MALE OR THE FEMALE PARENT. THAT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE PAY THAT PAYING FOR THEIR CHILD'S. COST. IN WHO HAS TO PICK THAT UP IS THE STATE AND THE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE WE DID THOSE FAMILIES TYPICALLY YOU IN THAT LOT OF CASES RUN ASSISTANCE SO. THE INCENTIVE THE REASON THAT THE INTEREST RATE IS HIGH IS TO FORCE THEM TO DO IT SO THAT THEY DON'T CARE THAT DEBT SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A WE'RE GONNA IS IN A POSITION WHERE IT JUST REALLY MAINLY DEPENDS ON. THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSON IT WHETHER THEY'RE TRYING TO SKIRT. TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND PUTTING ON THE BACKS OF THE TAXPAYERS. AND THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS. A GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS COULD BASICALLY GONNA ALLOW THEM DO NOT OCCUR THE DEBT AND THEN CONTINUE ON. WE HAVE TO FORCE THESE PEOPLE IF THERE IS. AN OF AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES TO PAY THEIR DEBT. FOR AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND I DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL GET US THERE AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS. YOU KNOW HOW DO DEDUCTED OUT OF SALARIES AND WORK TOWARDS A TRYING TO HELP THEM BE PRODUCTIVE AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES SO THE GOAL IS TO. GET THOSE FOLKS TO DO TO TAKE CARE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY NUMBER ONE WE USED TO CALL IT DEAD BEAT DADS BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE DAD. AND SO. I JUST. THINK THIS IS NOT GOING TO GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND I THINK THIS POLICIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE. IT LESS DEBT AND YOU AND THEM TO BE SKIRTING AROUND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BRING MORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS TO. PAY FOR THEIR CHILDREN RAISIN AND NOT BE ON THE BACK TO TAXPAYERS ARE URGING OVER ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. CHICKEN HEARING ON SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE DOWN THANK YOU SO JUST A IN MY CLOTHES I THINK A USEFUL PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE. IN. THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OF OUR EXISTING RULES THAT ALLOW THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE TO GARNER THE PERSON'S WAGES IF THEY'RE BEHIND IN CHILD SUPPORT. I'M AS SENT BY REAP LIFT ANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON THAT DEADBEAT PARENT WHAT IT DOES. IS HELP TO ENSURE. THAT'D BE PARENT IS NOT GOES FURTHER INTO DEBT WHICH IS I APPRECIATE THE POINTS RAISED BY. HAVING MORE TAX DOES NOT GIVE THEM MORE ABILITY TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT WE CAN STILL GARNER THEIR WAGES WE HAVE STILL MANY MANY MECHANISMS TO IN A FACT. EITHER FOR SIR DRIVE THAT PAYMENT THIS JUST HELPS ENSURE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PAY IT AND THAT THE CHILDREN DO BENEFITS AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

PASS ON FILE RIGHT THE NEXT FIVE ITEMS COLLEAGUES IF YOU PAY ATTENTION OF ONE OF THEM IS YOURS WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE READY WHEN THEY ARE INTRODUCED THEY ARE FILE ITEMS. ONE FORTY THREE WE WILL START WITH FILE. ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN AN ACT RELATING TO OIL AND GAS SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY TWO TO FIFTY THOUSAND OIL AND GAS WELLS. THIS FIGURE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND IDA WELLS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND POSE A HIGH RISK OF DESERTION. AS ALL PRODUCTION. GOES THROUGH ITS PHASES IN CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN STUCK WITH THE BAG FAR TOO MANY TIMES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN COMPANIES LIKE GRECO PREVENT ECHO LEFT THEIR OFFSHORE PLATFORMS ABANDON MAY HAVE BEEN HIT WITH THAT BILL. THIS BILL IS PART OF A LONG. LONG NEGOTIATED PROCESS LED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW MOAN WHO REPRESENTS THAT REGION THAT WAS HIT HARD BY THOSE ABANDONED PROJECTS AND I THINK REFLECTS A VERY REASONABLE COMPROMISE WHEN IT COMES TO ASKING THE OIL INDUSTRY TO PUT UP SOME AMOUNT OF SECURITY FOR THE REASONABLE COST. OF CLEANING UP THEIR WELLS OR PLUGGING THEM IN ABANDONING THEM WHEN THEY DO DESERT THOSE WELLS. FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS LESS. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION MOVING AROUND ABOUT THIS MEASURE AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT'LL BE RAISED HERE. BUT TO BE CLEAR THIS S NOT INTENDED TO GO AFTER OR TARGET THE SMALLER OIL PRODUCERS IN THIS STATE. BUT IT IT'S NOT FAIR IN MY ESTIMATION TO ALLOW THOSE PRODUCERS TO NOT HAVE ANY SECURITY FOR THE COSTUME PLUGIN ABANDONING THOSE WELLS NOW WHAT THE REASON WILL COST OF THAT IS REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT ACCORDING TO THE BILL. THEY CAN BE BASED ON THE OPERATORS COST ESTIMATES IT PROVIDED TO DEPARTMENT OF OIL AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. SO WE THINK HIS BILL REPRESENTS A FAIR COMPROMISE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT. INDUSTRY AND ALSO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS WEIGHED IN ON. THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUTURE OF DOG WHICH IS BEEN A PLAGUED AGENCY. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEES BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH IT THERE'S DISTRUST ALSO FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY AND IS RESOURCES CHAIR WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO TURN THE PAGE WITH DAUGHTER. SO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS SUGGESTED AT LEAST AS AN OPENING SALVO. TO ALTER THE NAME OF THE DIVISION. TO THE DIVISION OF GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT. AND ALSO TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT ITS MISSION TRULY IS. HEALTH AND SAFETY YES ARE A PART OF THAT AND THAT. THAT AGENCY OUGHT TO BE COORDINATING WITH OTHER AGENCIES WHEN IMPLEMENTING OUR STATE POLICY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION BUT WE THINK IS A CRITICAL MEASURE TO MAKING SURE THAT TAXPAYERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STUCK WITH THE BILL BUT THAT STILL GIVES INDUSTRY A PATH TO KEEP USING USING THEIR ASSETS GOING FORWARD IN A RESPONSIBLE FASHION. AND WITH THAT A RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU SENATORS STERN HE TO WAIT ONE MOMENT PLEASE WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS BILL OVER AND WE WILL COME BACK TO IT CHAU HOLD THAT THOUGHT COLLEAGUES WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THAT BILL. OF AT SOME OTHER POINT AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER PLEASE FEEL FREE BUT WE ARE GOING TO GO ON TO FILE ITEM ONE FORTY. SENATOR MITCHELL.

THE COURT SYSTEM PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS PROCESS HOWEVER HIGH CASELOADS OF LONGCASE DURATION CAN SOMETIMES POSE A BARRIER TO OBTAINING THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD. AB EIGHT FIVE NINE WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CONVENE A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO IDENTIFY WAYS UNDER DSS HIS PURVIEW TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY THAT COULD LEAD TO REDUCED WORKLOAD AN EXPEDITED CASE RESOLUTION.

ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AN ACTOR LENA FOR PRODUCTS SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT AB FORTY FOUR WHICH WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL TO SELL OR MANUFACTURE A NEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE. NOW FOR IS NOT A BY PRODUCT OF THE MEAT INDUSTRY IT COMES FROM ANIMALS THAT ARE FACTORY FARMED OR TRAPPED PURELY FOR FASHION. PERFORMING IN THE FUR TRADE ARE LARGELY SELF REGULATED AND IN THE U. S. THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS WHO ARE HELD ON THESE FORMS AND FOR BEARING ANIMALS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO HUMANE SLAUGHTER LOS. TODAY THERE ARE A VARIETY OF HUMANE ALTERNATIVES BOTH IN TERMS OF FULL FOR THAT IS VIRTUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REAL FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TEXTILES THAT ARE JUST AS WARM. OR FASHIONABLE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FUELING INNOVATION IN NEW AND SUSTAINABLE FABRICS RETAILERS SUCH AS GUCCI MICHAEL KORS JIMMY CHOO ARMANI AND CHANEL HAVE MADE THE DECISION. TO GO FOR FREE. SEVERAL CITIES AND PUTTING LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO WEST HOLLYWOOD AND BERKELEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A STAND BY PASSING ORDINANCES MAKING THE LEGAL TO SELL OR MANUFACTURE FOR WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES OPPONENTS CLAIM THE FOR CAN BE SUSTAINABLY RAISED IN A DOT ASKED US TO ADOPT. A PROGRAM THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS CREATED CALL FOR MARK BUT FOR MARK IS SIMPLY A CODIFICATION OF EXISTING ABUSIVE PRACTICES THE FUR TRADE IS TRYING TO LEGITIMIZE WHAT APPAREL COMPANIES FROM PRADA BERBERIAN TJ MAX EXAMINE THE FUR TRADE CLOSELY THEY QUICKLY REALIZED THERE IS NO WAY TO HUMANELY SORT FOR. SO THEY CHOSE TO GO FOR FREE. THIS MATTER WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE GIVING FOR MANY FACTORS AND RETAILERS OVER THREE YEARS TO SELL OFF AND TORY AND MOVED TO FOR. ALTERNATIVE CALL THERE IS REALLY NO REASON. CONTINUE TO PARTAKE IN ANY INDUSTRY THAT PUTS TO ANIMALS THROUGH SUCH SOFT. FOR NON ESSENTIAL ENDS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER GALGIANI. AS AN ANIMAL LOVER I HATE TO EVER SEE ANY CRUELTY ANY ANIMAL BUT I JUST WONDER IS THERE ANY KIND OF EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL FOR EXAMPLE AN ANTIQUE STORE THAT HAS OF HIS ORIGINAL MOTHERS SOMEBODY. YES OKAY WE TAKE A QUESTION. THIRD JACKSON WE TAKE A QUESTION FOR SURE THANK YOU FOR THESE RECEIPTS. IS THERE ANY KIND OF EXEMPTION FOR LIKE A CONSIGNMENT SHOP FOR AN ANTIQUE STORE THAT. TAKES ON A FOR THAT WAS OWNED BY SOMEBODY WHO FOR EXAMPLE PASSED AWAY AND THE FOR IS LEFT AT THEIR STATE SETTLERS. LIKE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SO IT WILL GET UNLAWFUL TO SELL OR MANUFACTURER IT'S JUST ACTUALLY KNEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE SO I WOULD SUSPECT THAT A AN ANTIQUE IF YOU WILL FOR DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE SANCTIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION. AGAIN REMEMBER THERE'S THREE YEARS OF IN WHICH SHOULD. COME INDIVIDUAL AND A DISPOSAL OF THEIR INFANT OF IRAQ. THANK YOU. THE USER GALGIANI MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TIE. I DID NOT COME TO SACRAMENTO TO SHUT DOWN LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES OR INDUSTRIES. I THINK THE FREE MARKET SHOULD DO THAT. SACRAMENTO'S DOING SO EVEN THOUGH I PROBABLY WOULD NOT PURCHASE. SUCH A PRODUCT BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE US THE RIGHT TO DO SO I BELIEVE IT SENDS A CHILLING CHILLING MESSAGE. TO OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY SOME FUND WHICH INDUSTRY WILL BE NEXT. BOB STORES I ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE ON AB FORTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THESE ARE MORE LIKE CENTER BORDERS. THIS BILL WHEN IT CAME BEFORE JUDICIARY. I POSE THE QUESTION THAT I DON'T THINK I EVER. THE PROPER WANTS TO THAT THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION AND SIGNATORY ENTITIES AND SIGNATORY STATES TO THIS CONVENTION THAT PRESCRIBE THE LAWFUL CENTER BORDERS IS THAT A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR OR THE FLOOR MANAGER FOR USE MAKE IS STATEMENT JUST. SPEAKING OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR AND- I ASKED THE QUESTION WHY DON'T WE INVEST IN MAKING THIS FRAMEWORK THAT ALREADY EXISTS MORE ROBUST. IF WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE ILLICIT TRADE IS REDUCED IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. SIMPLY HAVING CALIFORNIA TAKE A PROHIBITION APPROACH I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO REALLY AFFECT THE CHANGE THAT THAT PEOPLE WANT. SO I GUESS THE REASON WHY I WOULD BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE POINTS MADE EARLIER IS THAT WERE ATTACKING. THE WRONG TARGET. IT'S THE PRAYER THAT OTHERS HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THAT ACTUALLY WOULD IT WOULD HAVE MEANINGFUL TRACTION TO REDUCE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE PAST. BUT OUTLAWING IN CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY JUST GOING TO PUSH IT TO NEVADA AND ARIZONA AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. AND NOT TO MENTION OF COURSE THE ILLICIT TRADE WILL JUST CONVERT INTO THE BLACK MARKET TRADE SO UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF. THE PRODUCT THE PEOPLE DESIRE NGUYEN INSTEAD THE FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE ARE SUING IS THE REMEDY THAT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FORCING THIS LEGISLATION. NOT PURSUE THAT REMEDY. THE USER BORDERS CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. AS A MEMBER OF THE NATURIST ARSES COMMITTEE WE HEARD HIS BILL AND WE HEARD SOME VERY COMPELLING TESTIMONY FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SOME NATIVE AMERICAN CONCERNS ON THE BILL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL. BUT THAT THE- THAT THAT TESTIMONY MADE A PRETTY GOOD CASE. OF THIS BILL BEING PROPOSED BY. FIGHT REALLY A LEADERS TO FOR DECADES. THEYOR THEIR FAMILY. MAY HAVE WORN FOR BUT SINCE THAT IT'S NOW OUT OF VOGUE OR- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CAUGHT UP TO THAT SOCIAL STANDING. NOW THEY WANT TO STOP ANYONE ELSE FROM WEARING THAT FOR PRODUCT. AND I'D KIND OF FORGOTTEN MY OWN PERSONAL STORY. ABOUT THIS UNTIL AFTER THE TALK ABOUT HEARING WAS OVER. AND I WAS VERY VERY CLOSE TO MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER. WHO LIVED IN A PRESS HERE IS ON A- AND HER HUSBAND MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS A COPPER MINER IN BAGHDAD ARIZONA. AND HE WORKED VERY HARD HOURS HE WAS JUST A UNION LABOR MINOR IN THAT WORKING IN THE COPPER MINES AND HE DID THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. ED HE STROVE VERY HARD TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM DURING THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND SIXTIES. WHEN HE FINALLY WAS ABLE TO. RETIRE ANY PASSED AWAY IN THE EIGHTIES BUT MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER LIVED INTO THE INTO THE NINETIES. AND I REMEMBER HER SITTING ON HER PORCH AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT SONOMA LOT OF WORLDLY POSSESSIONS SHE HAD A SMALL EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT TWO BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A BATHROOM THAT BARELY WORKED IN PLUMBING THAT VERY BARELY WORK AFTER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD PASSED AWAY BUT ONE OF HER PRIZE POSSESSIONS. WAS THE FIRST SHOW ALL. THAT HE HAD SAVED UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE FOR HER. AND GIVE TO HER AS A- REFLECTION OF HIS LOVE AND CARE FOR HER AND I'M CENTER FLOWERS. SHE WORE THAT COAT ALMOST EVERY DAY. UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED. AS I SAID THEY'RE NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE BUT THAT FOR CO MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER. CENTERS FOR PRODUCTS AS HAS BEEN STATED ARE NATURALLY. THE MARKET IS NATURALLY DECLINING ON THESE PRODUCTS IN ONE WE JUST LET THE MARKET DO WHAT THE MARKET DOES. THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS BILL OTHER THAN ONE CLASS OF SOCIETY WANTING TO TELL ANOTHER CLASS OF SOCIETY WHAT THEY CAN OR CANNOT WEAR. AND FOR THAT REASON I ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU CENTER JONES MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER JACKSON PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID WANT TO. A NO TO A COUPLE THINGS TO ANTIQUE FURS ARE NOT PROHIBITED UNDER THIS BILL IT'S ONLY NEW MANUFACTURER. OR PRODUCED THAT FALLS UNDER THIS OF THE SALE OR RESALE OR VIEWS DURANTE IS NOT PROHIBITED IF YOUR GREAT GRANDMOTHER WANTED TO GIVE THAT FOR CO TO YOUR WIFE THERE'S NOTHING THAT OUTLAWS FOR DOING SO ALTHOUGH. I WOULD SUBMITTED BE KIND OF WARM IF YOU WORE IT EVERY DAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT- THIS BILL DOESN'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT WHERE. WHAT IT DOES THOUGH IS IT RECOGNIZES THAT TO. OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. HAS CHANGED THAT WE DO NT NEED FOR IN ORDER TO STAY WARM. THAT THE PRACTICES OF GROUPS LIKE FOR MARK AND I. I READ THIS AND I WAS HORRIFIED BUT. ANIMAL CRUELTY IS STILL STANDARD UNDER THE SO CALLED FOR MARK IN FACT THEY CONTINUE TO ALIEN VAGINALLY ELECTROCUTED ANIMALS. IF YOU WANT TO GET DOWN TO WHAT GOES ON. THEY GAS ANIMALS. THEY CAN FIND THEM IN CAGES. THE HAVE ARCHAIC LEG HOLDTRAPS FOR WILD ANIMALS. WHICH OFTEN LEAVES THESE ANIMALS FOR DAYS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER.

OR PURSUE A CLAIM UNDER PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT. EVER CASES THAT ARE FILED THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ARE NOTORIOUSLY SLOW TO BE RESOLVED IN THE COURSE OF ACTION IS TAKEN OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE AGREED TO EMPLOYEE. UNDER PAGA. SURVIVORS ARE ONLY ABLE TO COLLECT THE MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THIS OUTCOME IS CERTAINLY NOT SUFFICIENT GIVEN THAT SURVIVORS FREQUENTLY ENTER A LENGTHY LEGAL PROCESS AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY NOT PROPORTIONATE TO THE INJURY THEY SUFFERED IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND ALTERNATIVE LEGAL PAYOFF IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. CODIFYING EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO THE OPTION OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EQUIPS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WITH THE DESERVE THE OPTION TO ADDRESS THE DISCRIMINATION AND MISTREATMENT THAT THEY HAVE FACED IN THE WORKPLACE. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BY MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE FIELD MAN OR THE FOR MANAGER CENTER GAS WE TAKE A QUESTION WITHOUT OBJECTION ABSOLUTELY FINE PLEASE PROCEED. I THINK THIS HAS A LOT OF MERIT BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT. THIS THE THAT ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION APPLIES TO. A PREVAILING EMPLOYEE. BUT IS DISALLOWED TO THE PREVAILING EMPLOYER IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN THESE KINDS OF SUITS ARE FILED. THE PLAINTIFF IS THE ONE ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS FEES IF THEY PREVAIL THAT IS A STANDARD PRACTICE THROUGHOUT ALL THESE KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS. WAS IT. FOLLOW UP IF I MAY UM IT SEEMS IN THE IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS CHALLENGING AN EMPLOYER'S MISBEHAVIOR. THAT THE EMPLOYER HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLECT IN THE EVENT OF A FRIVOLOUS OR MERITLESS. ACCUSATION OR CHARGE WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST DECIDED AGAINST IN THE CRAFTING OF THIS LEGISLATION CAN WERE FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCESS THAT EXISTS FOR ALL OF THE OTHER KIND OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION BEHAVIORS. THAT WE SEE IN WORKFORCE OF THIS IS NOT UNIQUE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW. CURRENT PRACTICES ARE THE EMPLOYEES USUALLY ARE LOW INCOME FOLKS. WHO DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO ATTORNEYS. AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO SEEK JUSTICE. WHEN THEY TRY TO ADVANCE THEIR CLAIM TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS THANK YOU ALL AND WITH MY COMMENT HERE WORKERS WERE SAYING THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING PROTOCOL THAT EXIST ELSEWHERE IN THE LAW. BETTER CREE PRIVATE WRITER ACTION FOR A NEED AT A BALLOT BUT HE'S- BUT IN HIS BRAND NEW THAT'S NOT. IN ITS CURRENT FORM BOB. WEIR DISALLOWING THE PROTECTION IT MIGHT FORTY. AND OF FRUIT SUPPORT DOWN DIAL. I CHARGES THAT I THINK THERE'S AN ABOUT. ON WHAT IS OTHERWISE A MERITORIOUS HE'S A LEGISLATION. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER JACKSON WHICH WOULD CLOSE THANK YOU YOU KNOW NOT ALSO TOO FRIVOLOUS IF IT'S A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT THEN ATTORNEY'S FEES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PARTY. WHERE IT IS DEEMED THAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS BROUGHT A FRIVOLOUS ACTION THESE ARE CLAIMS THAT GO TO FULLY JUDY CAYTON AND IF THE EMPLOYEE PREVAILS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO GET. THE FUNDING FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO GET THIS IS A I THINK IMPORTANT THAT AGAIN ALL RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT ALL WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE A VERY IMPORTANT POLICY. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO FULLY AN APPROPRIATELY IMPACTED AND TO EFFECTUATE IT BECAUSE OF THE DELAYS THAT EXIST THIS JUST GIVES THE VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF. VIOLATION AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR DAY IN COURT AND TO TRY TO SEEK REDRESS FOR THE WRONG SAID HAVE KURT AGAINST THEM WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE.

AND COMMUNICATE VOTING DATES AND ELECTION INFORMATION. TWO STUDENTS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON FILE ITEM ONE FIFTY EIGHT SENATOR NIELSEN. PATTERN PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IT'S A CURIOSITY THAT OVER THE DECADES ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE. WELL THE LEGISLATURE'S FAST I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE. BUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED TO LISTEN TO GREATER TURN OUT OF OUR YOUTH. DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAVING ANY IMPACT. MAYBE WE DON'T NEED MORE BILLS MORE IDEAS THE DON'T WORK. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY INSTILLED IN OUR YOUTH IN THE HOME FROM THE PARENTS AND IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION. ONE OF THE GREAT DEFICIENCIES. IN MY EXPERIENCE AND K. TWELVE EDUCATION. IS THE LACK OF CIVIC EDUCATION THE TEACHING OF HISTORY. IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME WHEN I MEET WITH A YOUTH WHO COME HERE TO THE CAPITOL I MEET WITH. AB AROUND IN CALIFORNIA. MANY DON'T EVEN KNOW OUR PRESIDENTS. MANY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. NOW THAT USED TO BE TAUGHT. I ASSUME TO A SMALL DEGREE AT LEAST IT'S STILL AS. BUT I REMEMBER SPEAKING. IN AN ORCHARD. THE LITTLE OLD GLENN COUNTY SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE REDEDICATION OF A CEMETERY WHERE IN WAS REPORTED TO BE BURIED. WILLIAM F. B. I'D. ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THIS VERY STATE. LEADER OF THE BEAR FLAG. REBELLION AND I SPOKE. ABOUT THE LACK. OF ANY INTEREST IN HISTORY. AND THE DE EMPHASIZING OUT OF IT IN OUR SCHOOLS. FOR INDIVIDUALS CAME UP TO ME. AND THEY ALL THANKED ME BECAUSE THEY WERE HISTORY TEACHERS. AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW SENATOR WE DON'T GET TO TEACH HISTORY ANYMORE OUR SCHOOLS. WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. MOTIVATING OUR YOUTH TO HAVE A REFERENCE. ELECTORAL PROCESS. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF CIVIC EDUCATION. WOULD BE HELPFUL. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE SIX THREE BECAUSE FOR MIND READING AND INTERPRETATION IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE SUGGESTS IT THE ROOF SCHOOL HELPS TO EDUCATE AND SUPPORT STUDENTS TO BEGIN A LIFE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN VOTING YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES I THINK WE'RE HAVING TO REACH BACK WE'VE GOT BILLS THERE'S A MOVEMENT IN MY DISTRICT IN CULVER CITY TO. A CREEK NUMBER TO THE FOR SIXTEEN pI THINK WE'RE HAVING TO REACH FURTHER BACK BECAUSE WE'VE ALMOST GIVEN UP ON ADULTS GIVEN THE VOTER PARTICIPATION AND TURNED OUT. ROSS PARTY LINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT BY CREATING A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE IN COLLEGE CAN HAVE FACILITATED EXPERIENCES AND UNDERSTAND WHY VOTING IS IMPORTANT. I TRAVEL WITH THE SENATE LAST FALL TO THE COUNTRY OF BHUTAN IS FASCINATING. OF THE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR. IT'S A VERY YOUNG DEMOCRACY TEN YEARS OLD. AND WE WERE EMBARRASSED AS AMERICANS WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR NINETY PLUS PERCENT VOTER PARTICIPATION RATE. VERY CASUALLY TURNED IN AFTER HOURS AND WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN EMBARRASSMENT DIDN'T WANT TO CONFESS. WHAT A DEMOCRACY IS ALL DESIRES HAVE TO DO TO GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP TO VOTE AND SO BASED ON THAT I'M GOING TO STAND PROBABLY IN SUPPORT A BE NINE SIX THREE BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET WHAT EVER RESOURCES WHATEVER TOOL WHATEVER ENCOURAGEMENT WE CAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR NEXT GENERATION VALUES APPRECIATES THE RIGHTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR BATES.

WHO SHALL CONVENE A COMMITTEE OF RELEVANT ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY THE STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THE PLAN FOR.

ON MY OWN TIME IT REALLY DOESN'T SPECIFY WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THAT THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY NONPARTISAN WILL THEY BE TAKEN FROM THE STAFF OF THE UNIVERSITY OR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITHOUT BE SOMEONE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE DESIGNATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES WHERE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND- OTHER RESOURCE MATERIAL AND I TO ME THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE INFLUENTIAL ARE TO STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING ENGAGE IN THESE ENGAGEMENTS THAT ARE ONLY THIRTY DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL VOTERS TAKEN SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN THIS STATE AND UPS IN THIS NATION WITH LOW INFORMATION. FOR THAT WE DO HAVE I THINK WISH THAT WE WERE WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT DESIGNATION. BUT OUR SCHOOLS AND CERTAINLY COMPARED TO MY GENERATION I DOES NOT AS GOOD A JOB IN ENSURING THAT WE UNDERSTAND OUR DEMOCRACY THE PROCESS. THE PEOPLE THAT FOUGHT WITH THEIR LIVES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND- CONSTITUTION AND THOSE ARE ALL ONE THING VERY VITAL TO ENSURING THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE PEOPLE. WHO HAVE THE INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE IN THIS COUNTRY TO VOTE THAT THE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THEY DETERMINE FROM HEARING PROS AND CONS ON EACH ISSUE. PROS AND CONS ON EACH CANDIDATE AND THEN WE CAN BE ENSURE THAT WHEN THAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR BY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT IT TRULY IS NONPARTISAN SO UNTIL THAT IS.

EVERY CORPORATION THAT DOES BUSINESS IN THE STATE MUST PAY A TAX FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING SO THAT WE KNOW. THE MINIMUM FRANCHISED ACTED EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND FOR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES THE ANNUAL FEES IS THE SAME AMOUNT. CURRENTLY OUR LAWS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIQUE SITUATION OF ACTIVE MILITARY BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THEY ARE DEPLOYED TO SERVE AND REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE EVEN IF THEIR BUSINESS OPERATES IN THE NEGATIVE DURING THE SPAN OF TIME THAT THEY'RE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS. REPRESENTING OUR GREAT COUNTRY. BUSINESSES WHO ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION. WAVING THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX OR ANNUAL FEE ON THEIR BUSINESS IN YEARS THAT THEY DON'T MAKE A PROFIT. IT IS ONE SMALL WAY FOR US AS AMERICANS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO COME TOGETHER TO HELP THE SUCCESS OF THESE VETERANS BECOME SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY COME HOME AFTER DEPLOYMENT. FOR MANY BUSINESSES THIS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR FEET IS A BACK BREAKING THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX HAS NOT BEEN RAISED IN IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS.

MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HI RISE TO INTRODUCE AB EIGHT NINETY THREE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTRICT BILL THAT RESPONSE TO OVER WHAT AN OVERWHELMING CALL FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS TO STOP SELLING GUNS AND AMMUNITION ON STATE PROPERTY IN THIS CASE. THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS WE'RE ALL TOO AWARE THAT RARELY A WEEK IS GOING BY WITHOUT ANOTHER SENSELESS STRATEGY THIS TRAGEDY EXCUSE ME INVOLVING GUNS. FEDERAL IN ACTION ON COMMON SENSE GUN LAWS VCTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SO MANY CALIFORNIANS FEEL HELPLESS. WE ALL KEEP RESTATING THAT EVERYONE IS TIRED OF THE THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS DON'T GET ME WRONG I BELIEVE THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE IMPORTANT. ALL THE TIME AND HAVE THEIR PLACE IN TIME BUT ALL OF US UNDER THE STONE TODAY WERE GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY BY OUR CONSTITUENTS TO TAKE TANGIBLE REAL STEPS TO KEEP. ALL PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SAFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH AB EIGHT NINETY THREE. THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT IS BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE THREE CITIES THAT SURROUND THE AG DISTRICT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS HAVE PASSED RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT. OF STOPPING THE SALE OF GUNS AT THE TWENTY SECOND AG DISTRICT DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS. THE BOARD IS A LOCAL ONE AND THEY MOVED. TO TAKE ACTION. HI AND THIS LEGISLATION. LOOK I'LL TAKE AN ACT. I TO CONTROL WHAT IS DONE ON THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS SO. I WOULD ASK THIS IS A MEANINGFUL STEP TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE SURROUNDING CITIES I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS AND VOTE ON. THANK YOU CENTER ATKINS DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NIELSEN. PRESENTLY JOHN ONE OF THE U. S. SENATE I WILL. REPORT TO YOU A NOTE FROM OUR FLOOR ALERT. IT SAYS AS SIX SIX EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN A FEDERAL JUDGE PLACED IN JUNCTION ON THE DEL DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS DISTRICT BOARD AND REQUIRED THAT THEY MAKE A DAY IN THE TIME AVAILABLE FOR A GUN SHOW. AND THAT IS NOW BEEN TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHT. TWENTY NINETEEN SO A JUDGE HAS ORDERED. THAT THAT GUN SHOW PROCEED THE REMINDS ME OF A LONG DEBATE THAT WE'VE HAD HERE OVER THE YEARS RELATED TO THE COW PALACE. NOT HAVING GUN SHOWS AT THE COW PALACE. NOW I DO NOT KNOW. A VERY MANY CRIMINALS WHO EVER WENT TO A GUN SHOW AT FAIRGROUNDS THE BY THE GUN TO COMMIT THEIR CRIMES. THAT IS JUST THE ENVIRONMENT WORK CRIMINALS GAIN THE WEAPONS TO DO THEIR INFAMOUS DEEDS. PACKED AS WAY TO OPEN AN ENVIRONMENT. FOR THEM. I CAN APPRECIATE COMMUNITIES GETTING CONCERNED. BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THAT JUSTIFIES. BANNING GUNS SHOWS. OR. GUNS BEING DISPLAYED. ED OUR DISTRICT AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATION FAIRS. THE PROBLEM. OF CRIME BEING COMMITTED WITH GUNS. ALL OF THE BILLS THAT WE PASSED YEAR OVER THE MANY MANY YEARS. THE PROBLEM IS STILL HERE. MAYBE JUST MAYBE. SOME OF THE PROBLEM. IS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. NOT WITH THE GUN. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE TWO REASONS THIS EVENING TO VOTE NO ON AB EIGHT NINETY THREE ONE POLICY IN ONE FISCAL AND ALSO THE POLICY ON SEPTEMBER SECOND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD DANIEL L. L. AS OUR S. FIRED OFF A PISTOL IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS. IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR EL AS OURS WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE OF THE IRONY OF THAT TRAGIC CASE AND THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. THE SHOOTING DIDN'T OCCUR DURING THE ANNUAL GUN SHOW AT DEL MAR THE SHOOTING ACTUALLY HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF A RAP CONCERT AT DEL MAR. AND THE SHOOTER WAS MAD BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET A TICKET. THE ANNUAL GUN SHOW AT DEL MAR HAS NEVER HAD A SORT THIS SORT OF INCIDENT. LIKE THIS INVOLVING THE USE OF A FIREARM. PERHAPS THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL I TO CHANGES SO INSTEAD OF BANNING GUN SHOWS IT WOULD INSTEAD BAND CONCERTS AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS. AT LEAST IN THE BILL WOULD HAVE A THREAD AND A NEXUS TO GUN VIOLENCE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE ORGANIZED GUN SHOWS HAVE THE BEST RECORD OF SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND THE BEST RECORD OF ENSURING THAT GUNS DO NOT GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS. NOW ON THE FISCAL SIDE OF THE BILL. DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS IS CURRENTLY A DEFENDING A LAWSUIT THE BECAUSE THEY- INAPPROPRIATELY VOTED TO BAN GUN SHOWS CURRENTLY AT THE FAIR GROUNDS THAT LAWSUIT IS ESTIMATED TO COST THEM NEARLY A MILLION DOLLARS TO DEFEND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE LAS REVENUE OF BANNING GUN SHOWS IS IN NOT MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR THAT THE GUN SHOW LEGITIMATELY BRINGS INTO THE FAIR GROUNDS. AT THE FAIRGROUNDS IN IN TERMS TO USE IT FOR PROPER AND LEGITIMATE USES SUCH AS EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AT THE COMMUNITY ENJOYS IN AND AROUND THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS IN WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. ON AB EIGHT NINETY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER JONES ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SEEING AND HEARING NONE OF SENATOR. AT CONTINUE CLOSE YOU KNOW. TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR FROM SANTEE WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CONCERTS AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS HAS ALSO COME UP THESE ARE SMALL CITIES THAT ARE SURROUNDING THE AG DISTRICT BY AND FOR YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING TO STOP THE SALE OF GUNS AS AS AS PART OF THE GUN SHOW. HI THERE AT THE ACT MR. YOU KNOW IT AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT WITH WHATEVER VENDORS ARE TALENT THEY CHOOSE THAT'S PART OF. STATE LAW TO OUR SYSTEM OF AG DISTRICTS ARE DESIGNED THEIR STATE ENTITIES THAT ARE GOVERNED BY A LOCAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THESE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND KNOW WHAT TYPE OF THE VENTS TO HOLD ON THEIR FAIR GROUNDS. I COULDN'T WE COULD HAVE A WHOLE DEBATE AND DISCUSSION YET AGAIN ON GUNS. I'M STANDING UP TO PRESENT THIS BILL FOR MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL A NINETY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AN ACT RELATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT SENATOR WIENER. ARGUMENT MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES AB EIGHT NINETY ONE REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS. GREATER THAN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND TO ESTABLISH A PARKING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES SAFE OVERNIGHT PARKING LOCATIONS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES. THIS BILL PROVIDES LOCAL PROGRAMS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH RULES AND REGULATIONS OF LOCAL NEEDS. AS WELL AS AN APPLICATION OR ENROLLMENT PROCESS THAT INCLUDE CAN INCLUDE A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PARTICIPANTS. PROGRAMS CREATED UNDER THIS BILL WILL ALSO BE ENCOURAGED TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS AS WELL AS SITTING COUNTY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES. THE LEAD TO LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING. AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE SENATE CLARIFIED THAT A COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF UNDER ONE MILLION PEOPLE I SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLIANT WITH THE BILL. CITY LOCATED IN I MEAN HAS VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED A PARKING PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS. FURTHERMORE AMENDMENTS EXAM TO A CITY OR COUNTY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYEES COULD PAVE ACTOR MISSION THE VALVES TO PREVENT INJURY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO INSURE THAT THOSE WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO STAY OVER ARE YOU WHILE THEY WORK TO TRANSITION. TO PERMANENT HOUSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR BY BOAT. THANK YOU SURE WINNER PAID OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON FILE ITEM ONE. SIXTY FIVES MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THERE WAS A QUESTION I BUILD ASKING GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF I COULD ASK QUESTION OF THE- FLOOR MANAGER THE QUESTION SENATOR WIENER. ALL RIGHT PLEASE PROCEED FIVE YEARS THIS OBVIOUSLY IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A SPACE. BUT WE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE. FACILITIES LIKE RESTROOMS AND RUNNING WATER AND OTHER AMENITIES SO. YOU KNOW OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE AWKWARD I'M JUST WONDERING HOW WILL THOSE AMENITIES BE PAID FOR IS THE STATE PROVIDING A FUNDING SOURCE THROUGH ITS HOMELESS PROGRAM BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT HESE MUNICIPALITIES WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE. THIS PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY. PLEASE PROCEED ON THE BILL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM IT DOESN'T MICROMANAGE IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF RESTROOM. FACILITIES BUT ULTIMATELY CITIES WILL DESIGN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF FINDING YOU KNOW THAT. THE. THE STATE THROUGH THE CURRENT BUDGET AND THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN DRAMATICALLY INCREASING WHAT WE INVEST IN HOMES PROGRAMS WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY OUR MONEY TO GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SO THIS I WOULD THINK. AND HAVE THE TRIPLE CHECK BUT I WOULD THINK WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE USE IN TERMS OF APPLYING FOR FUNDING SO WE ARE INCREASING WILL WE GIVE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM HOMELESSNESS AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. MAYBE ON MY OWN TIME. THAT A PRESIDENT OBJECTIVELY IF IT SHOULD THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THIS BILL THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KEEP IN MIND THAT. IT'S A COLLABORATION IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WERE FORCING UNFUNDED OR UNDER IT TO ME UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT THAT JUST WOULD NOT. BE AT APPROPRIATE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THIS BILL I HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS I AM MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT NORMALIZING THE IDEA THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS AND TO THINKING THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE COME TO MY OFFICE OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE BASICALLY REDUCED ALL OF THEIR LIFESTYLE DOWN TO THE ONE VEHICLE THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AND THEY'VE GOT ALL OF THE REALLY POSSESSIONS IN THEIR VEHICLE AND THEY JUST WANT A PLACE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE- AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS HAS A SUNSET AND THAT WERE UP RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING UNITS RIGHT NOW AND WE CAN'T BUILD THEM WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WHICH IS THE SUNSET PERIOD I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE A PLACE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR VEHICLE OVERNIGHT AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM SOME DIVISION THAT THAT THE PEACE.

THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO ANY OTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR DIED HI IT IS A MORAL FAILURE THAT WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS AND THAT MORAL FAILURE IS OUR FAILURE AS A STATE TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT AND TO CREATE LEGAL RULES WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING TO HOUSE EVERYONE SO WE'RE PUSHING. WORKING PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE OLDER PEOPLE INTO THEIR CARS AND THAT IS A MORAL FAILURE WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT AND NOT FORCE PEOPLE INTO THEIR CARS TO LIVE BUT UNTIL WE GET THERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS THAT IS A REALITY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN LA ALONE AND EXCUSE UPPER THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND I AGREE WITH THE WITH SENATOR FROM US IN A SITE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT REALITY.

SENATOR HERTZBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT THIS MEASURE CONTAINS AN URGENCY BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS MEASURE IS URGENT. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST BUDGET ROUND IN AB ONE OH ONE PASSED A MEASURE THAT DEALT WITH THESE TYPES OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING WE ARE BUILT ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY DON'T REQUIRE SEQUEL APPROVAL. CITY OF LOS ANGELES PASSED MEASURE H. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HHH THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S GIVEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FOLKS IN LA CITY IN ORDER TO TRY TO EXPEDITE. ANY TYPE OF HELP THAT THEY CAN GIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS. WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE LAWS THAT WE PASS A LOOPHOLE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL THE ACTIONS SUCH AS FUNDING OR PLANNING DECISIONS TAKEN BY LOCAL AGENCIES EVEN IF THEY ARE ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND FIT ALL THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BEING CHALLENGED. UNDER SEEK WITH US DELAYING PROJECTS THAT'S DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXPEDITING ORDINANCE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES URGENCY IS ADDED. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS IS AN URGENT MATTER. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MADAM SO PRESIDENT I'M I RISE BECAUSE THIS I JUST I GET IT I UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE HOMELESS ISSUE IN LA AND I BELIEVE IT'S PROBABLY THE SAME URGENCY THAT CABINET ONE OF OUR THIRTY WE HAVE HOMELESS OUR ISSUES AND WHERE THE OBSTRUCTION OR THE CHALLENGE FORGETTING PROJECTS DONE ENDS UP FOCUSING ON SECA AND THE REASON I RISE TODAY IS NOT TO ASK YOU NOT TO SUPPORT THIS I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ASSEMBLY. HELD ALL OF THE SEQUEL BILLS THAT THE SENATE PASSED IN THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THERE WAS A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF BY THE CHAIR THAT THE SEQUEL WAS NOT CREATING A PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND YET HELLO IT WANTS AN EXEMPTION AND WHEN THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY USING A SEQUEL. EXEMPTION THEN IT'S OKAY SO I JUST WANT TO SAY. RECORD THAT I I'M DISAPPOINTED TO BE IN THIS POSITION I WITH MY BILL WAS LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD IN SOME OF THE POOREST. COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE TO BE ABLE TO CREATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT THAT WAS HELD AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUE WHEN WE MAY BE LOOKING AT SOME BUDGET ISSUES. TO DEAL WITH THAT. BUT IT IS ALWAYS DISTRESSING TO ME TO SEE. A AN ISSUE RAISED AN AN EXEMPTION FOR A PART OF THE STATE THAT HAS MORE LEGISLATORS THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE STATE AND YET. THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA CAN'T CAN'T SEEM TO GET ARE SUPER BILLS OFF SO I AS I SAID I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS. THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT SYKORA. WE NEED TO ANALYZE WHAT IT'S DOING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. THIS IS ONE OF SO. I ASK YOU TO RESPECTFULLY SUPPORT. FOR NINETY SEVEN. ANY FURTHER DEBATER DISCUSSION SENATOR NIELSEN. BETTER PRESENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE AYE AYE RISE AND VERY SINCERE SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE SEVENTY GALLON I HAD LEGISLATION JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO RELATED TO REBUILDING AND BUTTE COUNTY FROM THE TERREL PARADISE FIRE. AND I FIND THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE HERE THE ASSEMBLYMAN THIS BILL A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN ONE ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN IS A IS GOOD BECAUSE AS WELL SHE COULD EXEMPTIONS I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE COMPROMISING SEQUEL AND THROWING IN THE WASTE BASKET AND HONORED NOR IT. IT'S MEETING A NEED. THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES THE MORE I. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN SOCIAL CENTERS SENATOR BORCHERS. I JUST LIKE TO REAFFIRM THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED HERE. I AM ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT NGUYEN ISSUES OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE ARE BROUGHT FORWARD TO THIS BODY AND TO THE OTHER HOUSE THAT THEY'RE GIVEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF GRAVITY AND RESPECT IN SENSE OF URGENCY. I LOOK FORWARD TO ABSOLUTELY UNANIMOUS VOTE ON THIS AN IDENTICAL ONES THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING. HE FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SITTING IN HEARING HOUNDS I'M SORRY SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED SO FAR AND CERTAINLY A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS SEEMS APPROPRIATE. THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE BEEN AND MAYBE THE FOR JACKIE CAN ADDRESS IN A CLOSE IS TYING THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION TO THE HOW HOUSING FIRST MODEL AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AND THE ENERGY BEHIND THAT. THE CHALLENGE THAT I'M HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THEY'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME HOLDINGS SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOUR ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN A REMAINING IN THAT HOUSE FIRST MODEL AND SO WHEN YOU REMOVE THE ABILITY. OF. IN A REALLY TRYING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE COULD COME. RECOVER FROM EITHER A DRUG ADDICTION OR MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK MAYBE THE HOUSING MODEL THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL SOMETIMES LET'S IS DOWN AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED AS PART AS THE SECRET BEING AND TIED TO THAT. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR HERTZBERG IN MY CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE HERE LOOK THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS TRYING AS HARD AS WE CAN AND WE IS PARTNERS IN THE CITY OF LOS I MEAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO EXPEDITE THAT THAT'S WHY THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN REDUCED. I WOULD SUGGEST WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS PARTS OF THE STATE'S THE FACTOR THAT HAS ON INFORMED THIS LEGISLATION IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF LITIGATION IN LOS ANGELES THAT WE DON'T SEE AS MUCH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IF YOU LOOK AT WHO SUPPORTING WHO OPPOSING. THIS MAP YOU'LL SEE. FAMILY HOUSING TO EVERY COMMUNITY GROUP AT ALL. LOS ANGELES AGAINST THE VENICE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE WEST MORE. RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION I THINK THAT MAKES THE POINT. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF IN A SITUATION WHERE THE CITY HAS ADOPTED NUMBER OF ORDINANCES. AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS FOLKS IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN. TO SLOW UP THE PROCESS AND WE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND EVERY STATEMENT THAT WE MADE ON THIS HOUSE AND THE OTHER. THE OTHER HOUSE IN THE GOVERNOR IS TO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MOVE. HOUSE ALONG AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHILE THIS IN BODIES. THIS THIS VIEW AND YOU CAN LOOK AT JUST LOS ANGELES I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM KALENJIN. MADE THIS AN URGENCY MATTER BUT OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR SEVENTY TWO TO ZERO. THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL IS THE MODEL THAT WE ADOPTED IN THE MARK OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ADOPTED.

THE BILL FORTY FIFTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND ACT REALLY INTO ELECTIONS SENATOR HERTZBERG. WE HAVE ALL. EXPERIENCE IN ONE FORM OR THE OTHER. THE IMPACT OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY. WHICH WAS INFORMED BY GOVERNOR HIRAM JOHNSON MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHT YEARS AGO. CHALLENGES THAT THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY WAS TO. CHANGE THE GAME. PEOPLE POWER AND WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN. THAT THE WORLD IS SHIFTED. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EVERY QUOTE CITIZEN CLOSE QUOTE INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT UTILIZE A PETITION MANAGEMENT FIRM. WHICH PAYS EMPLOYEES IN A PERSECUTOR BASES IN THE AVERAGE COST TO PLACE AN INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO HERE'S A PROCESS THAT WAS INTENDED TO.-DEAL WITH SUFFICIENT POWER. TO IT POWER THE VOICE SHE'S FOLKS DIDN'T LIKE WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR DID. AND TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION THE RAILROADS AND OTHER ISSUES AT THE TIME. THE WORLD IS CHANGED WE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE NOW THAT'S IN THIS MEASURE DOZENS OF TIMES IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT AS I'VE SAID BEFORE ON THE FLOOR TOOK FORTY FIVE TIMES BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT TO PASS CONGRESS IMPORTANT MEASURES ARE CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE. BROUGHT FORTH FOR CONSIDERATION. SO WHAT IS AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE DO. IT PROHIBITS THE PAYMENT OF SIGNATURE GATHERERS ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS. IT WOULD REQUIRE THE 10% ONLY 10% OF SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY INITIATIVE WERE GATHERED BY VOLUNTEERS ARE NONPROFIT EMPLOYEES WHOSE MAIN JOB OUR DUTY IS NOT SIGNATURE GATHERING THE WORD SOMETHING THAT HAS SOME REALITY IN A POLITICAL MOVEMENT. AND UNDER THIS MEASURE SIGNATURE GATHERS COULD STILL BE PAID HOURLY OR TO STIPEND. WILL ELIMINATE THE INCENTIVE FOR PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS TO APPROACH INDIVIDUALS AGGRESSIVELY OR SPREAD MISINFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES BEGINS TO TRY TO PICK UP TO CHIP AWAY AT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S TRANSPIRED LEAST LAST ACTUAL SIGNATURE GATHERING DOT DRIVE WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BY VOLUNTEERS. IN PROP THIRTEEN WITH THAT I ASKED YOU I BILL. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES WHEN HEARING JOHNSON WAS GOVERNOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE LIVING HERE WE PROBABLY HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT WAS TRULY REFLECTIVE OF THE ELECTORATE. HEY IT'S A DIFFERENT DAY WHERE IN ORDER FOR US TO DO SOMETIMES WHAT IS RIGHTEOUS FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE TO GO TO THE BALLOT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY VERY WILL USE ROUTE. TO ENSURE THAT CITIZENS VOICES ARE HEARD. PROP THIRTEEN WAS PASSED HOW MANY YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO AS A- AS A STATE PEOPLE WERE REBELLIOUS OVER THE HIGH PROPERTY TAXES OVER PRODUCT PRICING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT WE CAN EMPLOYEES SOMEONE TO GET SIGNATURES TO GET SOMETHING ON A BALLOT. SO THAT CAN HAVE A LAWFUL ELECTION AND BE CONSIDERED AT THE BALLOT BOX. NOW THE LEFT PROBABLY DOESN'T LIKE THAT WE USE SIGNATURE GATHERERS BECAUSE OF THE PART OF THE LEGISLATION YOU CAN HAVE NONPROFIT SECOND STEP UP TO THE PLATE. AND DO THAT MANY THOSE SAME NONPROFITS ARE BENEFICIARIES OF LEGISLATION THAT HAPPENS HERE AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE SO CREATES A LITTLE BIT OF AN IMBALANCE. AND I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD MOVE TO TRY TO BAN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITY SO I THINK WE SHOULD RESERVE THE RIGHT FOR OUR CITIZENS TO CHALLENGE WHAT WE DO UP HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS CONTRARY TO. HOW THEY LIKE TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RUN AND IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL TO PAY A COMPANY TO DO THE LEGWORK TO GRAB THE SIGNATURES TO GET ON THE BALLOTS ARE CITIZENS CAN VOICE THEIR OPINION ON ISSUES. BEFORE THIS STATE THAT ARE PAST ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH A MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENS AND FOR THOSE REASONS. WE SHOULD DEFINITELY SAY NO AB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE FLOOR MANAGER IF YOU TAKE A QUESTION SENATOR HURT I WILL. PLEASE PROCEED. I AM I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE NON PROFITS AND UNIONS EXEMPTED. ARE FROM IN THIS BILL AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY ABOUT. WELL I THINK IT HAS TO DO. WITH THE NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THE EASE OUR EMPLOYEE BASE GROUPS. INDIVIDUALLY BASED GROUPS. MEMBERSHIP BASED GROUPS. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S IN THE CONSTITUTION THE IDEA OF THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATION. IT IS FOUNDATIONAL IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS. SO THESE ARE MEMBERSHIP GROUPS. THAT ARE FORMED BY A COMMON SET OF IDEAS THOSE COULD BE A SOME OTHER GROUPS THAT EXIST IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD THE ESSENCE OF THIS BILL IN TWO THOUSAND I DID THE SPEAKERS COMMISSION ON INITIATIVE REFORM. AND WASN'T ABLE TO GET PUSH IT THROUGH BECAUSE WE HAD THE ENERGY CRISIS AND REDISTRICTING AND THIRTY FIVE OTHER THINGS AND TRUCKS RUNNING INTO THE BUILDING. THE DISRUPTED US A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WE CAME UP RECOMMENDATIONS THESE BEING SOME OF THEM. THE NUMBER OF BILLS I'VE SEEN TWENTY OF THEM AT LEAST THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT TRY TO STOP AND MAKE IT ONLY VOLUNTEER IN THE LIKE BUT THIS IS A 10% PERCENT THRESHOLD IS ALMOST LIKE. PROPER LABELING THAT AT LEAST IT'S TRUTH IN LENDING IF YOU WILL THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME REAL PEOPLE BEHIND THE MOVEMENT RATHER THAN AND AN INITIATIVE RATHER THAN JUST A GIGANTIC PAYCHECK A BIG BIG GIGANTIC CHECK WE'VE SEEN INITIATIVES BEING FUNDED BY ONE INDIVIDUAL THIS REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT TO GATHER SOME THRESHOLD A QUORUM IF YOU WILL SOME LEVEL OF. THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY BEYOND THE NOTION OF THE CHECK AND THE UNIONS ARE NOT FOR PROFITS THEIR MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL AGENDA I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT. BUT THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUALS AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THOSE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A RIGHT TO VOTE AND THEY CAN VOTE FOR THE FIRST 10% OF THE VOTERS THOSE ARE VOTERS AND IS DEMOCRACY THAT. IS THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATION THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INCLUDED. BEN RESIN ON MY OWN TIME I JUST LIKE TO REFER TO SOMETHING IN THE ANALYSIS THAT I THINK GOES TO THE HEART OF THE QUESTION REGARDING. HI EQUAL ACCESS SAYS THE PROVIDED IN THE CONSTITUTION. I'D LIKE TO READ I MIGHT. VOLUNTEERS THIS MAY BILL MAY ALSO VIOLATE THE EQUAL PROTECTION AS IDEOLOGICALLY EXAMS UNIONS AND OTHER NON PROFITS FROM THIS REQUIREMENT. AND EVEN ALLOWS ARE PAID CIRCULATORS TO USE PETITIONS STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING PAID TO CIRCULATE PETITIONS. I THINK THE POINT HERE IS THAT YOU CAN HELP. MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND I'D LIKE TO REFER TO ONE THAT HAPPENED IN LAGUNA MIGUEL FOR MANY YEARS WE FIND AN AIRPORT WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS. AND WE HAD TO FILE OF PETITIONS FOR BALLOT MEASURES THAT WOULD STOP THAT WE USED PAID WE HAD MANY VOLUNTEERS WE YOU'D PAID CIRCULATORS BUT WE ARE ALSO A NONPROFIT. SO BASICALLY YOU COULD HAVE AN EMPLOYER WHO HAS A PARTICULAR INITIATIVE THAT ARE A BILL IS COMING OUT TOMORROW. ASIAN THAT'S COMING OUT THEM SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY FORM A NONPROFIT SAY THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES OR MEMBERS BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ALL OF THEM AND THEN THEY WOULD BE EXEMPTED TO I ASSUME. IT SEEMS TO BE THAT CONVOLUTED SO THE VERY PROCESS OF THE INITIATIVE BEING. THERE FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY AFFECT THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN THE LAWS THAT IMPACT THEM. SO I THINK THAT THIS REALLY DESERVES A VERY STRONG NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BASIS FOR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION.

ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FORTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTRICITY SENATOR DOLLINGER THE MAN PRESENT MEMBERS SAID TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. AB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO USE 10% OF THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM FUNDS FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO INSTILL FACILITIES IN HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. THESE INCENTIVE FUNDS. FUNDS FROM THIS BILL COULD SUPPORT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE LARGE FACILITIES SUCH AS WATER SUPPLIERS WASTE WATER AGENCIES. AND CAMPUSES AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED SMALL PHILLIES LIKE SCHOOLS AND FIRE STATIONS THIS BILLS RECEIVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS NO OPPOSITION TO RESPECT THAT FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU SIR DAHLE DEBATER DISCUSSION IS FOR ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STERN. WHERE THE MEN PRESENT VERY BRIEFLY STRONG SUPPORTER THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I JUST WANT TO KNOW TO MEMBERS THOUGH THAT THIS SMALL. SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE IN THE FIRE ZONES WILL BE A CRITICAL STEP BUT- IT IS FAR FROM SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE LOSS OF POWER FROM PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF FOR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. YES YOUR PROGRAM IS STILL NOT FULLY FUNDED. THIS IS A SMALL AMOUNT THEIR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET BUT THERE NURSING ASSISTED FACILITIES WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS EVEN REFINERIES BUT EVEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER POWER MAY GO DOWN OVER THIS FALL IN THE WINDS KICK UP IN THE FIRES KICK AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PLAN IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR HOWTO DEAL WITH THAT. SO I'LL BE STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY BUT WE HAVE GOT TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SENATOR STERN SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D SUPPORT THIS BILL AS I HAD THE HONOR OF AUTHORING THE US SHIP EXTENSION AND THE REQUESTING OF ITS TO FOCUS ON A STORAGE SB SEVEN HUNDRED WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. LAST YEAR I DO WANT TO KNOW TO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CENTER FROM LOS ANGELES. COUNTY TO SAID ON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS NOT COMMITTED TO EVEN FULLY FUNDING THE ESTá PROGRAM AND THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE FULL FUNDING ARRESTED SO 10% OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY WILL BE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS IN ALL OF OUR INTERESTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CPC DOES ITS JOB.

OUR EYES THIRTY NINE NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES COLLEAGUES WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO FILE ITEM ONE THIRTY NINE WE'RE GOING TO START THE PRESENTATION AT THE BEGINNING SENATOR STERN FILE ITEM ONE THIRTY NINE AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THE MON AN ACRYLATE OIL AND GAS. SENATOR STERN FLOORS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESENCE WE'RE BACK WITH A MEASURE I PRESENTED YOU EARLIER TODAY REGARDING. BASICALLY AN INSURANCE POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT TAXPAYERS ARE NOT STUCK WITH THE DIME IF NO OIL OR GAS COMPANY GOES BANKRUPT. FOR THE COSTA PLUGGING IN ABANDONING THEIR WELLS ALREADY THE TAB HAS RUN OUT ON ON HOLLY PLATFORM WHICH WAS A FORMER EXXON SITE THAT WAS THEN SOLD TO VAN ECHO INVENTED CO WENT BANKRUPT AND THE BILL I BELIEVE IS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS POINT. TWO HUNDRED. THIS BILL DOES NOT CAP THE LIABILITIES FOR OIL COMPANIES ON THE BACK END OF WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO REAP REMEDIATION OR DE COMMISSIONING. SO MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT A FREE PASS TO OIL. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE OPERATORS IN THIS STATE TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT UP SOME REASONABLE COST OF PLUGGING IN ABANDONING THAT WELL OR THOSE WELLS. PRIOR TO WORKING THOSE WELLS. THE COSTS ARE CAPPED A RIGHT NOW FOR THAT REQUIREMENT IT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE REASONABLE COSTS OF PLUGGING IN ABANDONMENT WHICHEVER IS LESS. SO WE THINK IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE MEASURE BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW. THE GOVERNOR WAIT IN. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN THE PROCESS AND IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE BEEN FACING A DOG OR- WHETHER IT'S CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. OR DEMI PERMITS THAT HAVE MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. FOR A GENERAL GENERAL. FRUSTRATION BOTH FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WITH THEIR ABILITY TO DO PROPER OVERSIGHT AND PERMITTING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. CHANGES ARE BEING MADE AND AN OVERALL WILL BE UNDER WAY. THIS FALL AND INTO NEXT YEAR. ENTITIES KICK OFF THAT PROCESS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A RENAMING OF THE AGENCY. I BELIEVE THE ACRONYM NOW WILL BE CAL JAM. BUT IT WILL BE THE GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE RESOURCES AGENCY. BUT ALSO IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MISSION IS BEING CLARIFIED IN THIS LEGISLATION. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THAT ALIGNMENT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE WORK THAT. THE FORMER DOGGER HAS TO DO THAT THEY'RE NOT ON AN ISLAND THAT THEY MUST COORDINATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THEM PLAN IMPLEMENTATION A STATE POLICY. SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION I KNOW THAT THERE'S SENSITIVITIES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO OPERATE IN IN CERTAIN AREAS WITH SMALLER INDEPENDENT OPERATORS. BUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO PUT ANY INDEPENDENT OPERATOR IN THE STATE OUT OF BUSINESS. THE REASONABLE COSTS A PLUGIN IN BANNING A WELL THOUGH. SHOULD BE REQUIRED AS SOME KIND OF SECURITY SO THAT WHEN THESE COMPANIES. DECIDE TO CHANGE COURSE LIKE GRECO JUST DID WHEN THEY WENT BANKRUPT OR LIKE VENN ECHO DID WHEN THEY LEFT THE HALL THE PLATFORM BEHIND THE TAXPAYERS WILL GET STUCK WITH THE TAP. SO THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU CENTER STERN DEBATER DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BECAUSE I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY ON THE FLOOR EXCEPT FOR MYSELF AND-MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN COUNTY THAT REPRESENT THE THREE MAJOR OIL COMPANIES CHEVRON AND C. R. C. AN ERA. BERRY IS NOW PART OF THAT WHICH REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION CALLED WITH CPAP. AND WE ALSO REPRESENT ALMOST TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SMALL OPERATORS THAT ARE IN THE SAID BY THE OR THE I. O. PA OF INDEPENDENCE. SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE EITHER THE MAJORS OR SOME OF THE SMALL ONES BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY BUT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. REPRESENT BOTH ENTITIES SO THIS IS A HARD DEBATE TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT IN THIS BILL IS BECAUSE- WE DO REPRESENT JOBS AND BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE JOBS IN OUR DISTRICT. WE REPRESENT THE CHEVRONS HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR CORPORATION AND WE REPRESENT THE RONNIE BRACKINS THE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR ORGANIZATION. EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MIDDLE AS WELL. SO THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT AUTHORIZES THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES DAUGHTER UNDER ITS NEW NAME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE OIL AND GAS OPERATORS NOT TO EXCEED DAUGHTERS ESTIMATE ESTIMATE TATIAN OUR ESTIMATION OF THE REASONABLE COST. OF PLUGGING IN ABANDONED WELLS. THERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PLUS COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED BIG OIL. AND THESE OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL OR YOU RECALL BIG OIL ON THESE COMPANIES HAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND WELLS EACH THAT THEY OPERATE IT'S MUCH IT'S HIGHER THAN THAT BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY SAY IT'S OVER TEN THOUSAND WHEELS WITH DECEPTION TO BURY THEIR ABOUT SIX THOUSAND MILES. THOSE ARE THE WHISPER MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE MEMBERS ARE THE SMALLER OPERATORS. AND WHAT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME ABOUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS AT THE SMALLER OPERATORS WERE CUT OUT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND A DEAL. I UNDERSTAND LET ME SAY THAT Y. WHISPER MEMBERS MADE THE DEAL. THE EXPOSURE FOR PUTTING THAT MONEY FOR EVERY WELL THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE VOLUME OF WELLS THAT ARE WHISPER MEMBERS HAVE AGAIN JOB CREATORS IN MY DISTRICT. THE EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE IF YOU CALCULATE IT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SKEWS ME A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ENSURE CAP ON A WELL WHICH IS THE ESTIMATE THE NUMBER'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND THAT'S A SIX BILLION DOLLAR. EXPOSURE TWO ONE COMPANY AND THAT'S PRETTY SCARY. SO I GET WHY THEY WANTED A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP I GET IT. IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM. BUT FOR A SMALL GUY THAT HAS TO PUT UP. ALMOST THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT AGAIN THE BILL DOES SOME DISCRETION THAT DOG CAN HAVE THE DISCRETION OF THAT PIECE OF THAT OF THAT. UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT BRACKEN WOULD HAVE TO PAY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO BE A DOCTOR'S DISCRETION. AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO UNDER THE LANGUAGE TO THE LESSER OF THE TWO. WHAT IS AFFORDABLE AND WHAT IS THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP. SMALL PRODUCERS LIKE I SAID THAT HAVE YOU KNOW FIVE AND TEN WELLS. LIKE RUNNY BRACKET THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT FOR EIGHTY HE'S EIGHTY YEARS OLD HE'S GOT OUT CHECKED AS WELL AS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND FOR HIM QUALIFY FOR THIS IT WOULD PAY TAKE HIM YEARS TO PUT AT THAT TYPE OF REVENUE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE NEED TO GO AFTER BAD ACTORS THE ONE TO ABANDON THESE WELLS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM VENTURE THAT SAID THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THERE ARE SOME BAD OPERATORS OUT THERE AND I AGREED. THAT WE SHOULD GO AFTER THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT. AND THE TAXPAYER SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER. THIS BILL HURTS OUR SMALL OPERATORS AND IT ONLY BUYS MAYBE A YEAR. FOR OUR LARGE OPERATORS WHEN THAT C. C. S. T. REPORT COMES OUT. AND IT ESTIMATES THE COST OF PLUGGING IN ABANDONED WELLS IN UPWARDS OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE ORPHAN WILL FIND TO BE ABLE TO SECURE. THAT TYPE OF LIABILITY AND I GET IT BUT THAT'S PARTIALLY OIL AND OUR FAULT AS LEGISLATORS. IN THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA OTHER THAN THE DA'S WILLIAMS BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS. FORGIVE ME BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER. THAT WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED OPERATOR TO GO BACK FLOOD OR DRESS ABANDONED OR ORPHANED WHAT ELSE. THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AFFECTED ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS WITH COLLEAGUES WHEN PEOPLE. STARTED LOOKING AT THIS ABANDONED WELL PROCESS. WELLS IN THIS STATE THE WERE ORPHANED OR ABANDONED SINCE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE. SO TO REQUIRE SO THINK ABOUT THIS TO REQUIRE OIL COMPANIES. TO IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATE ALL THESE ABANDONED WELLS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THE COST NUMBER ONE IS ANSWER ASTRONOMICAL AND SUSTAINABLE. IT NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS IN ORDER TO ABANDON THESE IDA WELLS. BECAUSE YOU COULD EVEN FOR EVERY OIL WORKER I BET YOU I BET AND I DON'T HAVE ANY STUDY TO PROVE IT BUT BASED ON THE INDUSTRY AND BASS WHAT I KNOW. AND HOW LONG IT TAKES IN THE PROCESS. I BET YOU CAN EMPLOY ALMOST EVERY IF NOT EVERY OIL WORKER WORKING SEVEN NAY DOUBT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND STILL. NOT BE ABLE TO PLUG OR ABANDONED ALL OF THESE WELLS. I REALIZE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. HOWARD K. WOULD IN MY DISTRICT AND IN MY- ACTUALLY WE SHARED THAT AREA. WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIS TEN WELLS. TEN WELLS AND HE'S GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO UP TO. A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR BONDING. RIGHT NOW HE PAYS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO. IT'S A TREMENDOUS REACH TO THINK THAT ANY COMPANY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THESE COST. SO EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS TO MITIGATE DOWN THESE COST IF THEY APPLY FOR THIS AND DAUGHTER ON THE NEW DIVISION. ISSUES ASK THEM TO MITIGATE DOWN THEIR COST YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE THROWING AROUND AS THIS NUMBER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'D HAVE TO MITIGATE THEIR COST BY 90% TO EVEN COME UNDER THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT'S ABOUT SIXTY WELLS SO ANYBODY ABOVE SIXTY WELLS IS GOING TO BE AT THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD EXCEPT. SOME OF THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED RANGING THINGS BUT THE MOST PROTECTION IT'S OFFERED IN THIS BILL IS FOR THE LARGE OPERATORS. AND I. THIS IS A HARD BILL LIKE I SAID BECAUSE I HAVE LARGE OPERATORS IN MY DISTRICT THAT PROVIDE JOBS. BUT MY PROBLEM IS THAT THE SMALLER OPERATORS WERE CUT OUT OF THIS DEAL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. LIKE I SAID THE ESTIMATES IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU MULTIPLY TWELVE THOUSAND MILES FOR ONE ORGANIZATION HERE IN THIS STATE. AND YOU APPLY A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR ESTIMATE FOR COSTS TO BE. TO ABANDON A WELL WHICH IS A NUMBER THAT'S BEING THROWN AROUND. AGAIN THAT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND I'M WILLING TO WORK ON A SOLUTION FOR PROBLEM BECAUSE- AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IS AS WELL A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM. TO THE FIX THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE HAVE TO FIX IT APPROPRIATELY AND THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND SO I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO PLEASE VOTE NO. OR OBSCENE SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON A REAL SOLUTION. AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENT COME UP WITH A GOOD SOLUTION. THAT DOES NOT. SHUT DOWN THE OIL INDUSTRY MUCH LESS THE SMALL OPERATORS AND I ALSO TELL YOU THAT. IT'S GONNA HURT WORKERS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. WHEN I DRIVE DOWN SIXTY FIVE ON MY WAY HOME I PASSED JERRY JERRY IS A GUY THAT WENT TO FULL SOME PRISM HE'S GOT A TATTOO ON HIS HEAD THAT THE TARGET HE'S GOT TO DROP SENATE SIGN IS AND NOW HE'S THE PTA PRESIDENT FOR A SEVENTH GRADER OR SEVEN YEAR OLD. IN FIRST GRADE. THE OIL INDUSTRY CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES THEY PROVIDE JOBS TO SECOND CANCERS. TWO WOMEN TO VETERANS. TO UNION WORKERS. AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. WORK ON THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN THIS STATE WITHOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE INDUSTRY AND THIS BILL FRANKLY STARTS WITH SHUTTING DOWN THE SMALL OPERATORS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT KIND OF LIMIT YOU HAVE IF THE LIMIT IS TOO HIGH TO ATTAIN YOU CAN'T MAKE IT SO IF YOU'RE TEN MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BOND FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THE CAP EVEN IF YOU COULD. SO I WOULD ASK YOU FOR A NO VOTE SO WE CAN PROVIDE A- A GOOD SOLUTION AND I REALIZE RENDERED AGAIN BECAUSE AT CCS HE REPORT IS COMING OUT AND I REALIZE THERE'S A PROBLEM IS STATE WITH IDLE AND ABANDON AN ORPHAN WELLS. BUT LET'S FIX IT RIGHT AND NOT AN INDIE JERK REACTION TO WOULD SATISFY A POLITICAL LEFT I ASK YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROCER JACKSON THANK YOU SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY OF A GUY WAS IMPRISONED TO RUN A. OR PARTICIPATE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY HERE'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. WHEN OIL COMPANIES FINISH DIGGING OIL. AND THEY ABANDONED THEIR WELLS. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS LEFT CLEANING UP THE MESS. WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WE'VE SEEN THIS IS A RESULT OF THE OFFSHORE WELLS IT IS THE TAXPAYER. WHO ENDS UP CLEANING UP THE MESS SO LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AS WAS INDICATED BY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LA WHAT BROUGHT THE OUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE SOME OFFSHORE FACILITIES THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THE COMPANIES WHICH HAVE BEEN MAKING MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DRILLING THE SOIL. ULTIMATELY DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. AND HANDING THE DEED BACK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE ONE YOU WANT ME AS TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE HAD TO PAY TO DECOMMISSION THESE WELLS. THAT'S WHO'S PAYING THE TAB. THE REASON FOR THIS BILL. IS TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY BACK ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRILLED THE WELLS WHO HAVE MADE THE MONEY BY REQUIRING THAT THEY BOND. BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO BELONG. THIS TRUST ASSURES THAT AT THE END OF THE LIFE CYCLE AND NO ONE SAYING WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEAVE IT'S WHEN THEY ARE DONE. DRILLING THEY CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY LEAVING US THE TAXPAYER WITH THE BILL. AND WE ARE PAYING THE BILL IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW WITH PLATFORM HOLLY. WE HAD TO HIRE THE COMPANY TO COME BACK IN TO RUN IT WHAT WE DO COMMISSION. THE TAXPAYER OF CALIFORNIA'S PAID OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR TO DECOMMISSION THIS WELL. THAT'S YOUR MONEY IN MY MONEY. BECAUSE THE OIL COMPANY WAS NOT PROPERLY BONDED SO THAT THE COST WOULD BE PAID BY THE BOND IN BY THE COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN MAKING THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. DRILLING OIL WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF ABANDONED WELLS IN MY DISTRICT. THE COMPANIES ARE LONG NOT A BUSINESS THEY ARE ORPHANED WELLS THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO PAY THE TAB. EXCEPT THE TAXPAYER. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. THE SMALL PERSON ISN'T GOING TO GET HIT THEY CAN COMBINED TOGETHER THE ESTIMATE WILL BE MADE AS TO WHAT THE COSTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE. SO THAT THE TAXPAYER DOESN'T GET. GET STUCK HOLDING IN PAYING THE TAB. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A GOOD BILL. IT IS A MODEST BILL. IT IS A BILL THAT SAYS YOU GOT TO LET US KNOW. AND YOU GOT A BOND. UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT SO THAT WHEN AND IF YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE WITHOUT CLEANING UP. THE AREA AROUND THE WELL WITHOUT DE COMMISSIONING THE WELL. AT LEAST THE TAXPAYER ISN'T GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR IT AND WITH THAT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON SEEING NO FURTHER SENATOR BOARD YES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE SOME TORN INTERESTS. MAYBE WE REPRESENT AREAS WERE DRILLING OCCURS WITH THE FOSSEL INDUSTRIES PRESENT. BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CAN WE SHOULD BE MISLED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE. I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. ALL THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS. ARE WILLING. TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM. AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE JUST A MOMENT AGO HAS BASICALLY SAID THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE CREATED PROBLEMS AND HAVE WALKED AWAY. I BELIEVE THAT PROBABLY HAS OCCURRED IN SOME INSTANCES BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT WE ARE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT IN TO USE THE WORDS OF SOMEONE ELSE A PARTIAL SOLUTION IS NOT A SOLUTION AT ALL. IN THIS EXACTLY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT HERE. THIS IS A PARTIAL SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE RELEVANT PLAYERS. IN A MORE SERIOUS ABOUT GOOD POLICY AS WE'VE HEARD THAT WE ARE. THIS IS NOT RIGHT FOR PRIME TIME. THIS IS A HALF BAKED PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MOST RELEVANT PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS PARAMOUNT THEN YOU CAN'T JUST SIMPLY HAVE A PARTIAL SOLUTION. I WOULD RECOMMEND RESPECTFULLY. THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT INDIVIDUALS IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE INTEREST P. RESPONSIBLE PLAYERS IN STEWARDS OF OUR ENVIRONMENT WHILE STILL KEEPING OUR YOUR OUR ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD LET'S BE REALISTIC HERE. BUT WE'RE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN WE HAVEN'T WE'VE NOT EVEN EXHAUSTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO ABSTAIN ALLOW THIS TO GO BACK TO THE PROCESS BE REINTRODUCED IN JANUARY AS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION ONE THAT ACTUALLY WILL BE SUSTAINABLE IT DOES NOT DRIVE OUT SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS. FROM THIS ENTIRE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS COMMUNITIES WILL BE DISRUPTED. AND ULTIMATELY YOU'RE STILL NOT GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION TO TAX PAYER FUNDED OVERSIGHT OF ABANDONED WELLS. BE REALISTIC PLEASE. ALLOW THIS TO COME BACK BUT IN A MORE MATURE AND SOPHISTICATED IN SUSTAINABLE WAY. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER STORAGE LIKE TO CLOSE SURE. THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION MEMBERS I WANT TO JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS OF CLARIFICATION IN MY CLOTHES HERE SO. WHATEVER SECURITY HAS TO BE PUT UP FRONT I DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CASH SO IT DOES NOT IT CAN BE IN THE FORM OF SELF INSURANCE LETTERS OF CREDIT. SO IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY REQUIRE CASH BE PUT UP FRONT THE REASONABLE COSTS. WHICH WILL BE THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S USED FOR THE SMALLER OPERATORS INCLUDES THE OPERATORS COST ESTIMATES THEMSELVES. SO THE ONLY LOSERS RIGHT NOW OUR TAXPAYERS AND STATE IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL IS DEFINITELY NOT INTENDED TO PICK WINNERS ACT YOU GO TO PAY NINETEEN OF THE BILL UNDER G. ONE. IT ALLOWS THAT ANY TWO OR MORE OPERATORS MAY ELECT TO ENTER INTO A LIABILITY SHARING AGREEMENT. SO THEY CAN PULL RISK AS WELL BETWEEN MULTIPLE OPERATORS SO WITH WITH DUE RESPECT TO THE TO THE SMALL YOU KNOW THE THOSE WHO STAYED FOR WELLS TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN WELLS-THEY'LL STILL BE. ALLOWED TO USE NON CASH SECURITY TEXTED TO BEAT TO PROVIDE THAT INSURANCE IN BE ABLE TO ALIGN WITH THEIR OPERATORS SAID THEY WON'T BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS NOW THEY WILL BE LINKED TO EACH OTHER'S PRACTICES TO SOME EXTENT AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME MEDICINES MAY BE WITHIN INDUSTRY TO SAY WELL I DON'T WANT. THE DESTINY OF MY OPERATION TO BE LINKED TO MY NEIGHBORS OPERATION IN THE SAME AREA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL THEY'RE OPERATING BUT WE ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO ENCOURAGE ALL OPERATORS IN A GIVEN AREA TO ALIGN WITH OTHER GOOD OPERATORS IN TO SAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO COLLECTIVELY. BY TO SECURE OUR OPERATIONS IN THE TAXPAYERS. DON'T GET STUCK WITH THE BILL SO. WITH DUE RESPECT CONSIDER THIS QUITE FULLY BAKED IN FACT IT'S BEEN BAKING ALL YEAR AND- IF WE ONLY HAD THIS IN PLACE A FEW YEARS BACK WE WOULDN'T BE ON THE HOOK FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE GOT. GOT TO WORK SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER STERN WHICH SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. ARCHULETA ATKINS BATES. BELL HI WE'RE JUST. BRADFORD KELLY AT ALL.

THIS YEAR THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE HAVE A CHALLENGE WE HAVE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE SOME IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY NOT WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA HAVE A COMPLETE COUNT. BUT INDEED I KNOW WE DO. WHAT AB FIFTEEN SIXTY THREE DOES IS IT WOULD PROHIBIT A PERSON FROM FALSELY REPRESENTING THEMSELVES. TO BE A CENSUS TAKER WITH THE INTENT TO INTERFERE WITH THE OPERATION THE CENSUS. WOULD ALSO INCREASE AWARENESS OF A PERSON CENSUS RIGHT RIGHTS UNDER THE CURRENT LAW CALIFORNIA.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS THIS BILL CREATES AN OPT IN STREAMLINED PROCESS OUGHT TO BUILD FARM WORKER HOUSING ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS. IT SETS QUALITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW HOUSING IS DIGNIFIED AND FAMILY FRIENDLY. AND PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AB SEVENTY THREE WILL INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR FARMWORKERS AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE DIGNIFIED AND QUALITY HOUSING. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT FARMWORKERS FROM HOUSING INSTABILITY AND DISPLACEMENT AND HELP TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL WORK FORCE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IS NOT JUST AN URBAN PROBLEM. IT AFFECTS OUR RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS AS WELL. WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT ARE FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES FACING CREDIBLY HIGH RENTS AN UP AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE QUALITY HOUSING. OFTEN LEADING TO UNSAFE FOR AN ADEQUATE LIVING CONDITIONS OR EVEN HOMELESSNESS. CURRENTLY I RECALL CHILDREN PLAYERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IT'S TO A TEMPORARY GUEST WORKER PROGRAM. BURNERS HOUSING BY RENTING HOUSES OR APARTMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR WORKERS. THIS PUTS PRESSURE ON THE EXISTING HOUSING SHORTAGE AND AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WE ARE DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON FILE ITEM ONE NINETY SEVEN. SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANTTO STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE. THANKS IMPORTANT POINT OUT THIS DOESN'T PRECLUDE. OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED BUT IT DOES SPECIFICALLY ARM FILL A GAP THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE'S FARMWORKER FAMILIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AND CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH THE SPONSORS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF FORMER FOR HOUSING BUT THERE'S TWO AREAS IN THIS BILL THAT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE FLOOR MANAGER TO ADDRESS THEM THAT THE IF I MAY. ARE THESE QUESTIONS TO JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS WOULD YOU ACCEPT THEM SOON ALL RIGHT PLEASE PROCEED. THE FIRST QUESTION I HAD IS THE- THE CONCERN THAT THIS HOUSING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE. TO THOSE WITH H. TWO A. VISA IS NOT THE WORDS THERE'D BE DISCRIMINATION AND THE AVAILABILITY THIS HOUSING BASED ON. A FARMWORKERS DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED STATUS COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. SURE WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT PRECLUDES THE USE OF STATE FUNDS THE PAPER HOUSING FOR EACH TO A WORKERS OUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT DOES. YOU CAN USE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PAY FOR HOUSING FOR A TO A WORKERS AND THE REASON IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE THE H. TO A AUGUST WORKER PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM WHERE AN EMPLOYER. BRINGS IN WORKERS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY. AND IS GIVEN ALLOW THE TO HAVE VISAS FOR THOSE WORKERS AS GUEST WORKERS AND IN EXCHANGE UNDER FEDERAL LAW THAT EMPLOYER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN BASIC LIVING NECESSITIES FOR THOSE WORKERS. INCLUDING HOUSING AND SO IN ORDER TO THE EMPLOYER BENEFITS BY BRINGING IN TEMPORARY GUEST WORKERS AND IS REQUIRED TO AMONG OTHER THINGS PROVIDE HOUSING. ON I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THAT OBLIGATION THAT THOSE EMPLOYERS HAVING HEARD UNDER FEDERAL LAW IN EXCHANGE FOR BRINGING IN. THOSE GUEST WORKERS I THINK WE SHOULD NOT BE FOCUSING OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE THERE'S EMPLOYERS HAVE THAT OBLIGATION AND THEY SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THAT OBLIGATION. AND SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY. QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTION IN THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND MY SECOND QUESTION. THIS IS LAND THAT FARMERS ON THEMSELVES BUT UNDER THIS LEGISLATION IT IT SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD THIS HOUSING. THAT ACTUALLY THE FARMERS THEMSELVES CAN'T BUILD IT THEY HAVE TO. RETAIN A- ANOTHER ENTITY ACTUALLY. TO CONSTRUCT THE HOUSING ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY IS THAT IS THAT I READ THE BILL CORRECTLY IT'S MORE ABOUT MANAGING. THE PROPERTY I THINK THE THINKING IS THAT YOU DON'T WANT SO YOU DON'T WANT THE BOSS TO ALSO BE THE LANDLORD. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THAT SEPARATION IF YOUR BOSS IS ALSO YOUR LANDLORD. THAT CAN CREATE HUGE PROBLEMS YOU LOSE YOUR JOB THAT MEANS YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY LOSE YOUR HOUSING. AND SO WITH THE FIGURE IN THIS BILL AND WE HAVE TO WORK LAST YEAR WHEN I CARRIED A SIMILAR BILL WE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY. TO WHINE AND OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY TO BE THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY MANAGES THE PROPERTY SO THAT YOU DON'T. HAVE THE BOSS AND THE LANDLORD BEING THE SAME PERSON. GREAT AND THEN I AM MY OWN TIME SO THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND I THINK. THOSE QUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTS SOME CONCERNS THAT THAT MANY HAVE ABOUT THIS BILL. HI DAD. ARE WE REALLY GOING TO BE IN THE POSITION OF CHOOSING. SOMEONE IS HERE A DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED. I AM MAKING THIS TYPE OF HOUSING AVAILABLE. AND IF THE FARMERS GOING TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING ON THEIR PROPERTY SHOULD THEY HAVE SOME RIGHTS. I IN TERMS OF BEING THE LANDLORD MAKING SURE IT'S- IT'S BEING RUN CORRECTLY. AND SO WITH THAT MEMBERS AT CONCERNS RAISED INTO AND FOR NOW AT LEAST FOR ME I'M GONNA LAY OFF ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WOULD TO RISE IN OPPOSITION SOME OF THE SAME REASONS WHY IT CALLING FROM ALAMEDA BROUGHT UP DURING QUESTIONING SO WE HAVE YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT IN MY DISTRICT WE RAISE ABOUT 95% OF THE WORLD'S STRAWBERRY PLANTS NOT THE BERRIES BUT THE PLANTS. AND WE RELY ON. THOSE AGE TO A FARM WORKER HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN ARE VERY RULE COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY WORK AND ADD IT BE AN ADVERSARY TO WHAT THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW TO TRY TO AND WE'RE STRAPPED FOR HOUSING FOR THESE WORKERS. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS WITH HIS BILL BECAUSE IS A THIRD PARTY AND NOT ALLOWING THE ACTUAL. SOME OF THESE ARE. BIG CORPORATIONS LIKE DRISKELL STRAWBERRIES TO HAVE AS STOP IN. THE MONTEREY AND THEY BUT THE OTHER PLANS OF THEIR AND SO WE WE'RE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE H. TO A PROGRAM AND HOUSING. IN MY DISTRICT FOR SOME TIME TRY TO SUPPLY GOOD DECENT HOUSING AND WORKING WITH THE COMMIES AND H. TO A PROGRAM. AND THIS. ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. WHICH EMPLOYEES ARE WHICH CATEGORIES I THINK WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT SO I THINK THIS BILL NEEDS A LITTLE MORE WORK AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE A OPPOSING BUILT. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR BILL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO I RESIDENTS SUPPORTER THIS BILL WHEN WE WHEN WE WROTE THE HOUSING BOND MEASURE WHICH WAS PROPOSITION ONE ON THE BALLOT. ONE OF THINGS WE DID IT IS REMINDED ME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD. MANY MANY MANY YEARS AGO WITH OF A COUNTY SUPERVISOR NAMED JOE SERRANO. AND JOE SERVICES SUPERVISOR HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND JOE WAS A CHAMPION FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING CONTINUOUS TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA OF NOT JUST PROVIDING THE FARM WORKERS WITH HOUSING BUT THE FAMILIES OF THE FARM WORKERS IN A SAFE SANITARY HOUSING AND SO WHEN WE WROTE. THE PROPOSITION THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS THIS LAST NOVEMBER WE PUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT TO THE SERRANO HOUSING PROGRAM FOR FARMWORKERS AND THE ODDS OF HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE USED TO BUILD. MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FARM WORKER HOUSING AND ONE OF THE REASONS I SUPPORT THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THIS WILL EXPEDITE THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THE HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NAY WERE SO FAR BEHIND IN IN THE AREA OF HOUSING. FOR FARMWORKERS AND NOW LET'S GET THIS PROGRAM THAT WE APPROVE THE VOTERS APPROVED JUMPSTARTED BY APPROVING THIS BILL AND GETTING SOME OF THIS HOUSING GOING SO WE CAN HAVE GOOD SANITARY HOUSING FOR. THE FAMILIES JUST AS JOE STARTED TALK TO ME ABOUT OVER TWO DECADES AGO AND I KNOW THAT HIS SON PHIL WHOSE ACCOUNTING SUPERVISOR HERE. AND SACRAMENTO WHAT ALSO SUPPORT. SENATOR TO RAZA. OUR FAMILY MY FAMILY I COULD HAVE LIVED IN INSTEAD OF. THE GROWERS BARN. OR A TENT OR IS SOME OTHER ONE OR TWO ROOM LITTLE SHACK. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN SUPPORTING THIS SO MUCH BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE I WOULD HAVE MADE IN MY FAMILY. OF HAD SOME PLACE TO LIVE. AND WE ARE NOT UNDOCUMENTED. WE'RE IMMIGRANT FAMILY WORKING. HARD IN THE FIELDS THE ENTIRE FAMILY. ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO WALK YOU START WORKING WHERE THE CREW. AND WE WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH ANYWHERE NEAR THE KIND OF HOUSING HUMANE HOUSING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD. AND I'LL END WITH THIS LITTLE STORY ABOUT HOW. SIXTEEN THE LANDLORD WITH THE EMPLOYER SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. WHEN MY LATE HUSBAND AND HIS FAMILY GOT INVOLVED WITH THE UNITED FARM WORKERS UNION AND SAYS OUR JOB IS. THEY THEY WENT ALL THE WAY. THEY EVEN HAD TO GO OUT ON STRIKE TO TRY TO GET BRING SOME DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS TO THE FEELS. AND ONE DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THE GROWER SHOWS UP IN HIS CAR TO THE SHACK WERE MY HUSBAND AND HIS PARENTS AND FIVE BROTHERS WERE LIVING. MANY CALLS ABOUT ANY TELLS MY HUSBAND'S FATHER WHO DON'T. YOUR THE BEST WORKER I HAVE HERE. BUT YOU'RE A CHUBBY STUFF FEAR GOING TO HAVE TO GO. ANY VICTOR THE WHOLE FAMILY RIGHT THERE THAT MOMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THAT'S WHY A LANDLORD SHOULD NOT BE YOUR EMPLOYER BECAUSE THE POWER THAT IT BRINGS TO YOU. SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO ANYONE I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR DORADO ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY CLOSE. MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMON SAID I THINK ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY REMEMBER ABOUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE THAT AN EMPLOYER BUILD HOUSING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THIS IS AN OPT IN pWE'RE SAYING IS IF YOU WANT TO STREAMLINED PROCESS WHERE YOU CAN BUILD A HOUSING ON YOUR AGRICULTURAL LAND AND OVER RIDE. SOME LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESSES IF YOU WANT THAT PRIVILEGE. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO YOU CAN'T HAVE BARRACKS AS YOUR HOUSING YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACTUAL HOUSING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEPARATE ENTITY BEING A LANDLORD YOU CAN'T BE BOTH THE BOSS AND THE LANDLORD AND I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE THINGS TO ASK FOR THIS STREAMLINED PROCESS. AND THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING THESE EMPLOYERS FROM PROVIDING OR BUILDING HOUSING FOR THEIR AGE TO A WORKERS IMPACT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY ARE REQUIRED. TO PROVIDE DOT HOUSING ALL WE'RE SAYING IS YOU CAN'T USE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS DOLLARS TO FILL YOUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING WHY ON EARTH. CALIFORNIA. SUBSIDIZE AND HE FOR EMPLOYERS FEDERAL LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO THEIR AGE TO A WORKERS IT MAKES NO SENSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN.

FOR PROFIT PRISON COMPANIES HAVE NOT LIMITED THEIR BUSINESS VENTURES. TO PROFIT PROFITING FROM THE CAR SERRATION OF CALIFORNIANS CONVICTED OF CRIMES. DAVID PRISON CORPORATIONS ALSO PROFIT FROM INCARCERATING CALIFORNIANS IN CIVIL DETENTION. AB THIRTY TWO WAS AMENDED TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS SUBJECT TO CIVIL DETENTION. AS FOR PROFIT AS FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS THESE COMPANIES HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS THEY'RE ABLETO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY INCREASING THEIR INMATE POPULATION AND CUTTING OPERATIONAL COSTS WHICH IS BOTH DANGEROUS AND DETRIMENTAL TO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN HELD IN THESE FACILITIES. IN MY VIEW THIS DUTY IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THE REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE THE REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM RATES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. IT ALSO CONFLICTS WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE WELFARE AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR RESIDENTS.

I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF ME COULD UNDERSTAND THAT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY YOU DON'T WANT TO SWEET INDIVIDUALS FROM PARTICIPATING IN A JUDICIAL PROCESS EITHER DIRECTLY OR AS A WITNESS IN DIRECTLY BUT I THINK THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAN THAT IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO IMMIGRATION ISSUES. IT'S EVERYTHING IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS THE SUBJECT OF A WARRANT AND HERE SHE HAPPENS TO BE AT THE COURTHOUSE. WHY WOULD WE DISSUADE THE SHERIFF FROM EXECUTING THEIR OBLIGATIONS OR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOING THE SAME. IT JUST KIND OF FLIES IN THE FACE THIS IS NOT A CHURCH. THERE ARE NO SANCTUARY PROTECTIONS OF THIS NATURE OF COURTHOUSES THE JUDICIAL BUILDING. AS SUCH IT IS PART OF THE STATE SO I'M UNAWARE THAT WE SHOULD BE THAT WE HAVE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT PROVIDE SANCTUARY THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ASKING. IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEN I THINK WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A WHOLE SLEW OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES INSTITUTIONS AND BUILDINGS THAT ARE GIVEN THE PROTECTIONS THAT USED TO EXIST IN AN OLDER PERIOD OF CIVILIZATION AS IF THEY WERE HIDING IN A MONASTERY OR CHURCH AND THAT'S JUST. NOT UP TO DATE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR TO ROSS SO YOU MAY CLOSE.

SENATOR TO RUSSELL ARE YOU READY. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACCOLADE TO EMPLOYMENT IN MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THERE FOR. SENATOR ALSO THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES ARE RISE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AB FIVE. LAST APRIL THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT GAVE US A TOOL THE COUNTER THE DECADES OLD PROBLEM OFGROWING MISS CLASSIFICATION WHEN THEY ISSUED THE LANDMARK DYNAMIX DECISION. AGAINST THE DELIVERY COMPANY THAT WAS MISS CLASSIFYING ITS DRIVERS THIS DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS DRAFTED BY THE REPUBLICAN CHIEF JUSTICE AND SIGNED ON TO BUY EVERY REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT ON THE COURT. THE RULING STATED THAT A HIRING ENTITY MUST MEET THE CRITERIA LAID OUT IN THE A. B. C. TEST IN ORDER TO CLASSIFY AN INDIVIDUAL AS A CONTRACTOR. THE TEST AS IS USED IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT TO BE CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AN INDIVIDUAL MUST FIRST BE FREE FROM THE DIRECTION AND CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. TO PERFORM WORK OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THREE HAVE INDEPENDENTLY ESTABLISHED AS A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN A DIFFERENT TRADE THAN THAT OF THE HIRING ENTITY THE COURT MADE IT CLEAR IT WAS NOT REFERENCE SEEN MOST BUSINESS CONTRACTS. THE PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY COULD CONTRACT WITH AN ELECTRICIAN TO FIX THEIR LIVES BUT IT COULD NOT CALL THEIR WORKERS WHO DELIVERS PACKAGES AND DO THE MAIN WORK OF THE BUSINESS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. DYNAMAX HAS BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND FOR A YEAR AND A HALF WHICH HAS LEFT SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES. IF THERE WERE NO LEAD LATE IN DYNAMIC CONTINUE TO BE THE LAW. HOWEVER WE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN BE PROACTIVE AND PROVIDE WORKERS IT BUSINESSES CLARITY ON HOW THIS DISEASE DECISION APPLIES. ULTIMATELY WORKERS THIS IS ON THE STATE WILL BENEFIT WHEN THERE IS A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT STAND TO DETERMINE EMPLOYMENT STATUS. PROMOTES CLIENTS AND IS EASILY ENFORCED. AB FIVE REPRESENTS A COMPROMISED APPROACH WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IT CODIFIES THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN WORKERS MOST VULNERABLE TO MISS CLASSIFICATION. FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE INTO THIS FOR THEMSELVES. AND HAVE TRUE INDEPENDENCE IN THEIR WORK. A LARGE THE EXEMPTED PROFESSIONS UNDER THE BILL TEND TO OPERATE WITH SIGNIFICANT AUTONOMY. AND BARGAINING POWR IN THE WORKPLACE AND HAVE HISTORICALLY EXISTED OUTSIDE TRADITIONAL WAGE ORDERS IN OTHER WORDS MOST OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN MAKE OVER TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS OUR STANDARD IN EXISTING LAW FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE EXEMPTED FROM OVER TIME MEAL AND REST PERIOD REQUIREMENTS. AB FIVE DOES NOT GO AS FAR A SOME HAVE HOPED. BUT IT GOES A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THAT WHERE THERE WAS NOT A PROBLEM BEFORE DYNAMICS THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE. THE BILL PROVIDES CERTAINTY FOR A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNDER THE PREVIOUS BOROUGH LOW STANDARD. THE BILL EXAMS DOCTORS DENTISTS INSURANCE AGENTS FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND MANY OTHER LICENSED PROFESSIONALS THE BILL EXEMPTS WORKERS WHO HAVE PRE EXISTING LAW THE CONFLICTS WITH DYNAMICS SUCH AS REALTORS COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS. THE BILL EXEMPTS MANY OCCUPATIONS WERE INDIVIDUALS OPERATE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENJOY INDEPENDENCE A TRAVEL AGENTS HAIR STYLIST AND GRAPHIC DESIGNERS. THE BILL EXEMPTS MANY BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTS INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS CONSTRUCTION TRUCKING REFERRAL AGENCIES MOTOR CLUB CONTRACTS WITH TOWING COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES CONTRACTING WITH OTHERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE BUSINESS. AGAIN AB FIVE DOESN'T ADDRESS EVERY ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BUT THE BILL HAS GONE A LONG WAY TOWARD THE DRESSING THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE WAKE OF THIS DECISION. THE AUTHOR AND BILL SUPPORTERS HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TALKS WITH INDUSTRIES THAT PRESENTED MORE COMPLEX CHALLENGES WITHOUT HALTING THE CERTAINTY AWAITING MANY INDUSTRIES. MEMBERS LET'S% NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TODAY WITH THIS BILL WITH ONE CLEAR TEST ACROSS OUR STATE LABOR LAWS WE WILL RAISE THE STANDARDS FOR MILLIONS OF WORKERS AND ENSURE THEY GAIN ACCESS TO CRITICAL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS WE CAN MAKE CALIFORNIA A GLOBAL LEADER IN PROTECTIONS. BRIGADE WORKERS JANITORS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND SO MANY WORKING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN PAY THEIR RENT. THE ISSUE OF WORKER MISS CLASSIFICATION IS NOT NEW AND IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY A PRODUCT OF THE MODERN DAY QUOTE UNQUOTE GIG ECONOMY. COMPANIES HAVE EXPLOITED MEN AND WOMEN FOR DECADES BY USING UNLAWFUL PRACTICES IN INDUSTRIES LIKE CONSTRUCTION JANITORIAL AND TRUCKING TODAY THE SO CALLED GIG COMPANIES PRESENT THEMSELVES AS THE INNOVATIVE FUTURE OF TOMORROW. A FUTURE WHERE COMPANIES DON'T PAY SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE WORKERS COMPENSATION OR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE NOW THAT'S A TIME BOMB THAT WILL MAKE UNFUNDED PUT PUBLIC PENSIONS LOOK LIKE SMALL POTATOES. THIS MODEL COST CALIFORNIA SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST TAX REVENUE FUNDING. ALI THE OUGHT TO BE PUT TOWARDS IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE AT CETERA ET CETERA. LET'S BE CLEAR IS NOTHING INNOVATIVE ABOUT UNDER PAIN SOMEONE FOR THEIR LABOR OR BASING ON ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL ON MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS UNDER THE GIG ECONOMY BUSINESS MODEL WORKERS ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY SO FORGET WORKER GETS INJURED OR SICK OR CAN EVEN WORK TO SUPPORT HIMSELF HERSELF FOR THE FAMILY. THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT WORKER FALLS ON THE TAXPAYER. MEANWHILE COMPANIES LIKE UBER COMPENSATE EXECUTIVES NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. AND THEY'RE WORTH NEARLY A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. AS THEIR DRIVERS WHO MAKE THE BUSINESSES RUN. SLEEP IN THEIR CARS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO FIFTY THREE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES REAL COMPANIES WHO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN EMPLOYER AND WHOSE EMPLOYEES MAKE UP CALIFORNIA'S TAX PAYING MIDDLE CLASS WHY SHOULD WE EXEMPT QUOTING QUOTE GET COMPANIES FROM THE VERY SAME LAWS WE REQUIRE OUR LOCAL MOM AND POPS TO BUY BY. BY MISS CLASSIFYING THOSE WORKERS THESE BAD ACTORS FORCE BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE RULE OF THE LAW FORCE THEM TO SHUT THEIR DOORS. TODAY WE ARE DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO BE COMPLICIT IN THE EXPLOITATION OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS OR- WE CAN CHOOSE TO REBUILD. THE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS PROTECT TAXPAYERS AND HELP RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES THRIVE IN THE STATE COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SENATOR GROWTH WHAT PURPOSE AT THE MINUTES OF THE DESK. SENATOR. GROVER IS OFFERING SOME AMENDMENTS MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ THE SET OF AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR GROVE SET ONE. EXCUSE ME PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND AND IGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ISSUED A DECISION TO CHANGE THE WORK LIFE OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO THAT DEPARTED FROM A THIRTY FROM THIRTY YEARS. OF CALIFORNIA LINE CREATED A NEW TEST TO DETERMINE WHO IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THE TESTS THE A. B. C. TO US IS A RIGOROUS TEST WHICH IN AN INDEPENDENT COMPROMISED MEET ALL THREE OF THE CRITERIA IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS. PART EIGHT OF THE TEST REQUIRES THE WE'RE GOING TO BE FREE FROM THE CONTROL AND DIRECTION OF THE HIRING ENTITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK BOTH UNDER THE CONTRACT IN FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF WORK IN PART B. OF THE TEST REQUIRES THE WORKER THAT THEY PERFORM THE WORK THAT IS OUTSIDE. THE USUAL COURSE OF THE HIRING INTO THESE BUSINESS AND PART C. OF THE TEST REQUIRES A WORKER THAT IS MERELY ENGAGED IN THE INDEPENDENTLY ESTABLISH TRADE OCCUPATION OR IS OF THE SAME NATURE OF THE CONTRACT THE WORK IS PERFORMED. THIS RULING ESTABLISHED THREE THE FORM OF THE APPOINTMENT. TING READ THE WAGE LAWS FOUND ANYWAY THE CAT. THERE ARE ON THE ENDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WE HAVE MOMS WHO WORK DRIVING UBER WHILE THEIR CHILDREN ERIC SCHOOL AND THEY SET THEIR OWN HOURS. THE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WORK AS DOOR DASH AFTER CLASS TO AFFORD HIGH COST OF LIVING IN ADD TO THEIR INCOME. THE MANICURIST TO SET THEIR OWN APPOINTMENTS RENT THEIR OWN BOOZE AND SHE'S WORK. A TO WORK AS THEIR OWN BOSS THESE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE TRUCKERS OUR THERAPISTS ARE A TOM INTERESTS. ARE CATERS ARE FORESTERS INTERPRETERS ARE MEDIA INDIVIDUALS AND REPORTERS. IN FACT NEARLY HALF A MILLION OF MILLENNIALS CURRENTLY FREELANCE AND 79% OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PREFERRED THIS WORK. OVER TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT. INSTEAD OF HELPING ALL OF THESE CALIFORNIANS THIS BODIES INTRODUCED AB FIVE WHICH ISSUES CARVE OUTS TO CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF PICKING FAVORITES WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES. A ONE SIZE FITS ALL EMPLOYMENT TEST SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT. APPLY TO THESE CALIFORNIA'S TO DEPEND ON THEIR INCOME FROM INDEPENDENT CONTRACT WORK. THIS IS WHAT MANNER TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS TO AB FIVE WHICH WOULD MATCH CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT TESTS TO THE FED'S STANCE. THESE AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED WITH BOBBY IN COHESIVENESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STANDARD IN THERE WOULD NOT BE A SEPARATE TEST. FOR A PEOPLE THAT OPERATE IN THE FEDERAL STANDARD AND THE STATE CAN'T STANDARD THE PEOPLE WHO WILL FALL UNDER THE BROILER TEST AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PART OF THE CARVE OUT. THIS BENEFIT BOB THIS BENEFITS BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES ACROSS INDUSTRIES BY ASKING WHETHER THE WORKER IS ECONOMICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE HIRING ENTITY. THIS TEST ACCOUNTS FOR DIVERSITY OF WORK PLACES AND WILL ONCE AGAIN MAKE A SIDE GIG INDEPENDENT CONTRACT WORK A FREELANCE JOB IT WILL BE THE OPTION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AGAIN IN LIKE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES CHOOSE. MEMBERS I URGE YOU FOR THE SAKE OF ALL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE ONES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER EIGHTY FIVE WE'VE PUT AMENDMENTS ACROSS THE DESK IN THIS BILL IS A BEEN AMENDED SEVEN SEVERAL TIMES. BECAUSE WE KNOW ALL OF THE FACT THAT THESE WILL HAVE ON THE DISC WILL COVER WE'VE EXCLUDED REALTORS DOCTORS LAWYERS THERE'S BEEN A MINUTES ACROSS THE DESK FOR JUST NEWSPAPER DELIVERY COMPANIES TODAY. JUST TO DELAY IT FOR ONE YEAR BUT THERE IS I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT PART OF THIS BILL THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A CARVE OUT. THIS BILL IS GOING TO AFFECT AND IT'S NOT JUST THE GIG ECONOMY THAT YOU'RE AFTER. SO I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS.

SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ARE SKILLED INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUCH AS BRIDGES ROADS DAMS RAIL AND HOSPITALS ETCETERA UNDER AB FIVE TODAY ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE A. B. C. A. B. C. TEST. THE FOLLOWING DESIGN PROFESSIONALS SHOULD SIMILARLY BE EXEMPTED THE LAND SURVEYORS GEOLOGISTS GEOPHYSICISTS LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS AND THE PLANNERS. DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ARE NOT MISCLASSIFIED IN DOING SO WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE FISCAL SENSE. IS USUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO HIRE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS AS CONTRACTORS RATHER THAN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES SINCE CONTRACT RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE IN HOUSE FOR THIS REASON THE DESIGN INDUSTRY USES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ON SHORT TERM PROJECTS AND A LONGER TERM PROJECTS PREFER TO HIRE THE INDIVIDUAL IN HOUSE INSTEAD. DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ARE HIGHLY SKILLED HIGHLY PAID PROFESSIONALS ARE CONTRACTED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL MAKES ON AVERAGE FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUR. A COMMON INSTANCE OF AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DESIGN PROFESSIONAL IS THAT OF A RECENT RETIREE WHO HAS A SPECIFIC SKILL SET AND THAT IS NEEDED ON A PARTICULAR JOB FOR WHICH THERE AREN'T OTHERS WITH THAT SKILL SET LOCALLY AVAILABLE. THE DESIGN INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED IN WHICH YOU MAY NEED ONE TYPE OF ENGINEER OR SURVEYOR FOR ONE PARTICULAR JOB AND SOMEONE WITH ANOTHER. SAYS SUBSPECIALTY OR EXPERIENCE FOR ANOTHER JOB.

THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO OPERATE WITHOUT FEAR OF HAVING TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. AND CEASING TO HELP OTHERS. NONPROFITS PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. AND MY FEAR IS THAT THE DYNAMAX DECISION. WILL DRIVE MANY OF THESE NON PROFITS OUT OF BUSINESS. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE NONPROFIT SOME MIGHT BE IMPORTANT SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES FOUNDATION. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN RED CROSS THE NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY ST JUDE'S CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL PITA.

THANK GOD I'M PRESIDENT CENTER GROVE HAS AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE SET TWELVE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT SENATOR EXCUSE ME SET MISTER SECTOR PLEASE READ. SEPT TWELFTH. AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR JONES SAID TWELVE THANK YOU SENATOR JONES ONLY AMENDMENTS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT PER SHEET THAT I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT THEIR MEMBERS TO EIGHTY FIVE. EARLIER TODAY THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS ATTEMPTED TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEN THIS BODY IGNORED THE PLEAS FROM HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THE DESIGN INDUSTRY INCLUDING LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS.

NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TRUCK OWNER OPERATORS FORCED ENGINEERS AND LICENSE TIMBER OPERATORS. NOW I BRING BEFORE THE SENATE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HELP WITH THOSE DEAL WITH THE REPUTATIONS OF THIS BILL THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO KEEP IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THIS AMENDMENT AB FIVE WOULD DELAY THE EFFECTS OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION FOR TWO YEARS. SO WE CAN GIVE THOSE WHO REFUSED TO HELP TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE IMPACT OF THIS IS OF THE DECISION. IT WILL ALSO HELP PREPARE THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE FURTHER SOLUTIONS TO THIS DECISION WATCH OUR BODY HAS ADMITTED WILL COME IN THE NEXT SESSION. THIS IS A COMPROMISE THAT WE SHOULD ALL AGREE IS ONLY FAIR THAT THIS BODY IS GOING TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS THEY SHOULD ALSO HELP THOSE WHO ARE HURTING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH LAWS. I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THE MINUTES SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MOVED TO A LADY I BELIEVE THE FINAL THIS NUMBER TWELVE SET OF AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE. NON DEBATABLE ATTORNEY OBJECTION TO SUBSTITUTE IN THE PRIOR ROLL CALL SEEING NONE ICE TWENTY NINE KNOWS ELEVEN THE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID ON THE TABLE. AT THIS POINT. IN TIME SENATOR DRAWS SO. THESE PRESENT EXCUSE ME HAVE YOU PRESENTED YOUR BILLING CHIEF AT THIS POINT THERE THAN WE ARE OPEN NOW FOR DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ON THE BILL IN CHIEF. STARTING WITH SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED THE AUTHOR LEADERSHIP THAT UP PUTTING SO MUCH TIME TO. THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY BUT- I IN ALL HONESTY I DO SO RELUCTANTLY. UNLIKE WHAT MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE LAWS. IT GOVERN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS IN THEIR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. HI THAT WAS DONE BY THE DYNAMICS DECISION. MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. WHAT THIS BILL DOES FOR THE MOST PART. IS GRANT EXEMPTIONS TO THAT COURT DECISION. BUT IN MY VIEW THE BILL GOES ABOUT THIS TASK IN THE WRONG WAY. WE SHOULD BE WRITING SMART BROAD BASE RULES. THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FROM EXPLOITATION. FOR GIVING PEOPLE THE FREEDOM TO CONTROL THEIR OWN HOURS PAY. AND WORK PRODUCT IF THEY WISH TO DO SO. WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING INNOVATION AND EMPOWERMENT. NOT FORCING PEOPLE INTO EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY DO NOT WANT. THE RATHER THAN OFFERING SENSIBLE RULES THIS BILL PROVIDES A LIST OF SPECIFIC JOBS AND PROFESSIONS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM DYNAMAX. THEY ARE THE CHOSEN FEW. WE HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY GET TO CONTROL THEIR OWN FATE. THE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS ARE EXEMPT. BUT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE NOT. TUTORS TO TEACH THEIR OWN CURRICULUM OUR EXAM THE TUTORS TO HELP STUDENTS MASTER OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CURRICULUM. ARE NOT. FULL CLEANERS DOG GROOMERS AND PICTURE HANGERS YOU GET THEIR JOBS THE REFERRALS ARE EXAM. BUT HOUSE PAINTERS ARE PLUMBERS ARE NOT. INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS WHO DRIVE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY OUR EXAMS. BUT THE SAME DRIVERS TO HAUL FREIGHT ARE NOT. THIS LAST ISSUE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS IN CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. OR BORROWED AGAINST THEIR FUTURES THE BY HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND EQUIP THEM WITH ENGINE CERTIFIED AS CLEAN BY OUR AIR QUALITY REGULATORS. HE'S TRUCKERS DECIDE WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK. HOW MUCH THEY CHARGE AND WHERE THEY GO. THEY ARE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS. BUT BY DENYING THEM AN EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL WE ARE FORCING THEM TO WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. IT STOPPING EXPLOITATION WERE THE ONLY ISSUE HERE. INSTRUCTORS. WHO ARE BEGGING FOR THE FREEDOM TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS WHICH SURELY QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION. THESE ARE SELF MADE BUSINESS OWNERS. MANY OF THEM IMMIGRANTS USING THEIR BUSINESS TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER. DENYING THEM AN EXEMPTION FROM DYNAMAX WILL CAUSE MAY DISTRICT DISRUPTION TO THEIR LIVES AND TO OUR ECONOMY. AND I PROJECT WILL BACK WILL BE BACK HERE DEALING WITH THESE CONSEQUENCES NEXT YEAR. WE WILL ALSO BE FIELDING COUNTLESS REQUESTS FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. WHO WERE NOT SAVVY ENOUGH TO HIRE A LOBBYIST TO WIN AN EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL. AND FOR YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO CREATE A SERVICE THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST TODAY WILL HAVE TO WIN THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL FIRST. FOR MANY PEOPLE TO PAY THEM AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. WILL LIKELY BE BREAKING THE LAW. SO I SUGGEST WE PASS THIS BILL TODAY TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO WIN AN EXEMPTION TO THE DYNAMICS RULING. WITH THE PROVISION IN THIS BILL. BUT OUR WORK DOES NOT END WITH THIS VOTE. IN MY VIEW IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. YOU MUST RETURN IN JANUARY AND CONSIDER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE. BALANCE REFORMS. THAT PROTECT WORKERS FROM ABUSE. WITHOUT PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ALLOWED TO WORK FOR THEMSELVES. AND WHICH WILL BE FORCED TO WORK FOR THE MAN. WITH THAT RIGHT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE AB FIVE IS ABOUT STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING WORKERS WHO NEEDED AND PROTECTING LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESSES AND IT'S ABOUT TIME. AND HONEST BUSINESS CANNOT COMPETE WITH BUSINESSES THAT DON'T PAY MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS COMPENSATION OR PAYROLL TAXES THE VAST MAJORITY OF BUSINESS OPERATE ON AND EMPLOYMENT MODEL NOT ONLY PAID WORKERS BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL SAFETY NET THAT WE ALL ENJOY EVERY DAY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE EXPENSIVE LAWYERS TO ADVISE HIM ON HOW TO SKIRT THE LAW OR DEFEND AGAINST LAWSUITS THEY NEED CLEAR RULES AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE A LEVEL OF PLAYING FIELD. DYNAMAX AB FIVE PROVIDE A CLEAR OBJECTIVE STANDARD. AS A REALTOR AND THOSE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY WE'RE SO PROUD IS WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED HERE I WAS CONCERNED THE DYNAMICS WOULD IMPACT THE INDUSTRY IN THE WHOLE BUT THE AUTHOR WORK WITH US AND THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY TO RECOGNIZE THAT REALTORS AND PEOPLE LIKE REALTORS HAVE A UNIQUE STRUCTURE AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THEY DID THE SAME FOR MANY MANY OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHO WORK AT DIRECT SELLERS LIKE MARY KAY AND MANY MANY OTHERS. LET PROVIDE CLARITY TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CONTRACT FOR HR. PAYROLL AND OTHER SERVICES LET PROTECT DOCTORS ENGINEERS THAT PROTECT THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND THOSE WHO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO SERVE AND REPRESENT US. LET'S ALSO PROTECT THE WORKERS. AS WE COMPLETED LABOR DAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND HONOR AB FIVE BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DOING HONORING LABOR I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR ARCHULETA SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM PRESIDENT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR VERSUS COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS ISSUE FOR DECADES MORE THAN THREE I CAN STILL REMEMBER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO I WROTE AN ARTICLE ONE OF MY FIRST. THERE WAS PUBLISHED IN A NATIONAL PUBLICATION ON THE VERY SUBJECT ARE OUR CLERGY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR THEY COMMON LAW PLEASE OF THEIR CONGREGATIONS OR SYNAGOGUES. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY ARE EMPLOYEES AND SHOULD BE RECEIVING A FORM W. TWO. BUT THE IRS IS HAD CRITERIA FOR A LONG TIME ON WHETHER YOU'RE INDEPENDENT OR IF YOUR COMMON LAW. AND THE MAJOR FACTORS ALWAYS BEEN WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FIGHT GO WITH HELD WHICH WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR SO MANY TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. BUT AB FIVE. AND DYNAMAX. STARTS TO GET INTO AN INTERESTING AREA. IT PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN IT SHOULD BE PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK ON HOW YOU ARE DETERMINED TO BE A COMMON LAW EMPLOYEE OR AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. SO NOW WERE WERE BRAGGING ABOUT EXEMPTIONS. SELECTING INDUSTRIES IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. IF YOU WANT TO BE A FULL TIME. UBER DRIVER OR A LIFT DRIVER AT AND THEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAXI COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE YOU ARE NOW IT TAXI DRIVERS AND THEY ARE EMPLOYEE. HI A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE NO VOTE ON AB FIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORALE YES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I DO RAISE TODAY AND HIGH OPPOSITION AB FIVE YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A SAYING I SAID A ONE TIME ON THE FLOOR VOTE FOR THAT. THE DUTY THE LEGISLATURE. YES TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR ON FAVORITISM TOWARDS NOT. WE CANNOT CLAIM THIS AT ALL ON THIS BILL THIS DOES GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WHAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT THAT IS WE CUT THE LEGS OUT RIGHT FROM UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO IS TRYING TO GET STARTED. IT'S INTERESTING THAT BILL GATES APPLE DELL COMPUTER EVEN WHILE THIS AND HE STARTED OUT OF THEIR GARAGE MOST BUSINESSES START ON A SHOESTRING AND THEN YOU. HOPEFULLY GROW AND IF YOU SUCCEED. WHICH 85% OF SMALL BUSINESSES I'VE READ DOWN. WELL THEN YOU KNEW YOUR BUSINESS GROWS AND YOU START ADDING POLICE BUT YOU KNOW IN THIS STATE A CEO MAGAZINE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS IN A ROW EACH YEAR THEY SEND OUT A- THE QUESTIONNAIRE TO SOME OF THE TOP FIVE HUNDRED CEOS IN. AND AGAIN THIS YEAR CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTEEN YEARS IN A ROW IS RATED THE MOST HOUSE STYLE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS AND THIS IS AGAIN JUST GONNA BE. ANOTHER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT AND X. THE STENCH OF THREAT. TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND I THINK THE THING IS ONE WHEN I. MY ITEM THAT I HAD MY MA'AM AND I BROUGHT FOR WERE WHICH WAS FOR PHYSICAL THERAPIST YOU KNOW. SOME NURSING HOMES DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE FULL TIME. PHYSICAL THERAPIST SO MANY OF THESE THERAPISTS WORK FOR DIFFERENT FACILITIES AS WELL AS A DOZEN DIFFERENT DOCTORS AS WELL AS A HANDFUL HOSPITALS. AND SO DO YOU RECOGNIZE AND SEE HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR THEM THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THOSE DOZEN DOCTORS THOSE COUPLE HOSPITAL CELLS. SENIOR NURSING HOMES AND ASK TO BE PUT ON THEIR PAYROLL LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT SAME WITH THE TRUCKERS IT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE. SOME OF THESE INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS WORK FOR. KERRY FREIGHT FOR TWENTY DIFFERENT COMPANIES SO IMAGINE THE HOW COMPLICATED THE SITUATION THAT IS SO AGAIN. YOU KNOW IT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ASSAULT ON THE FREE MARKET. IN AGAIN I A IT IS A SLOUCH TORSO TOOK SOCIALISM WHEN GOVERNMENT CONTROLS. WITH BUSINESS STATUS SO WITH THAT. I'M A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ. THAK YOU I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIVE AND UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW THIS ISSUE ALL TOO WELL AS THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER OF LONG BEACH APPOINTED CHAIR TO THE HARBOR IN THAILAND'S COMMITTEE WITH THE LARGEST PORT IN MY BACKYARD BOTH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH WITH THOUSANDS OF TRUCK DRIVERS ARE EMPLOYED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO BE EXACT IN TOTAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE THEY'RE FORCED TO FINANCE THEIR TRUCKS WITH ONE COMPANY PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR LEASE FUEL AND MAINTENANCE AND ADDITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSES AS WELL AS ASSUME LEGAL RISKS THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING WHEN OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS A RECORD NUMBERS OF CARGO AND THE DRY IT'S COMPANIES PULLED REVENUE UPWARDS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS YET OVER FOUR HUNDRED TRUCKING COMPANIES AT THE PORT HAD BEEN CITED WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN JUDGMENTS FAVORING TRUCKERS. USA TODAY PUBLISHED ARTICLES ABOUT THIS LITIGATION'S ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LA CONTINUED. ON BEHALF OF THE TRUCKERS AND IT MANY OF THESE TRUCKERS WERE EXPECTED TO WORK OVER TWENTY HOURS A DAY. REASSIGNED TO THE LOWEST PAYING GROUPS MANY OF THESE ROUTES WHICH OFTEN TRANSLATED INTO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. OR LESS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF WORK WHICH RESULTS AT THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR DYNAMICS IN AB FIVE DOES NOT FORCE OWNER OPERATORS TO BECOME EMPLOYEES IF THEY ARE NOT BEING MISCLASSIFIED. SIMPLY EMPOWERS INDEPENDENT OWNERS OWNER OPERATORS BY REMOVING THE MIDDLE MAN OR BROKER AND ALLOWS DRIVERS TO SET THEIR OWN RATES WHICH IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE. CONSTRUCTION TRUCKING ALSO HAS A VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION THAT RECOGNIZES THE PATTERN OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS WE HAVE SOME EMPLOYEE DRIVERS AND OCCASIONALLY HIGHER INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS. THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS OF AB FIVE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE SMALL TRUCKING COMPANIES. BUSINESSES SUCH AS A TRULY TO TRULY ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH ASSISTANCE TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THIS INVOLVED AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. IF THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED ARMS ARE IF% THEY ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT THEY HAVE A DIRECTION TO BE SO AND AS THE DAUGHTER OF A TRUCK DRIVER WHO GAVE THIRTY YEARS TO HIS LIFE MAKING ABOUT ONE IN THE MORNING. TO BE ABLE TO. PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MY BROTHER AND I. PERSONAL TO ME. BUT I'M ONLY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO RETIRE. AT THE AGE OF FIFTY NINE HE'S NOW FISHING. SMOKING CIGARS HAVING A GREAT TIME TAKING CARE OF HIS GRANDCHILD. AND THAT'S BECAUSE- HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN A UNION AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL. THANK YOU. SENATOR NIELSEN. SENATOR NIELSEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE MADAM PRESIDENT. WE WERE. IN A MANNER WITNESSING THE DASHING OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE LAND OF FREEDOM THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. EVER SINCE THE FIRST. PHIL GRAMM'S SETTLED HERE. ACTUALLY WAY BEFORE THAT. WHEN THE INDIGENOUS INDIAN TRIBES FEDERAL THIS LAND. THEY HAD AMBITION. THEY HAD DREAMS. UNFETTERED DREAMS OTHER THAN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH THEY HAD TO LIVE IN. LIKE THE WEATHER. THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY LIVE WHICH IS CHALLENGING. BUT AS A NATION. WE'VE GROWN. BY INSTILLING AND NOURISHING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. THE SPIRIT THE STRIVE TO BETTER ONESELF. IF THAT MET WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE. WONDERFUL. BUT CHAU OVER MANY OVER THE HISTORY OF THIS GREAT LAND. HAVE A SPIRE AND FOR THEIR OWN LITTLE PLEASE PIECE IN THE SUN. PLACE IN THE SUN. THEIR OWN LITTLE BUSINESS. HOW MANY WONDERFUL STORIES OF THESE COURAGEOUS ENTREPRENEURS THESE DREAMERS. WHO FASHIONED THEIR DREAM. AND A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR THE GENERATIONS. AND FOR TENS HUNDREDS ZIP THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS AMERICANS WHO HAD JOBS. BECAUSE OF THEM. THE UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS GREAT NATION OF FREEDOM. HAS PROVIDED. HAS NOW. DURING A BIT OF A SETBACK. THOSE WHO ASPIRE IN FACT THE SPIRE IS NOT GOING TO BE MUCH OF AN AMERICAN WORD ANYMORE AFTER THIS DECISION. THEN THE ANSWER TO IT FRANKLY IS NOT. CARVE OUT. IN FACT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME CARVING OUT I WOULD HOPE WOULD SPEND MOST OF ALL OF NEXT YEAR CARVING EVERYTHING OUT WE COULD POSSIBLY. CARVE OUT OF THIS. BAD DECISION. MY POINT AGAIN. THIS LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. IS NOW EXPERIENCE A GRAVE SETBACK. AND THE ASPIRATION IN THE HOPES. FOR THE FUTURE. OF THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US. THOSE OF US NOW STRIVING. AND THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO COME OUT BEFORE US OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN CHILDREN. WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR OWN PEACE. BUT THE SUN. AT THE OPPORTUNITY THIS GREAT NATION PROVIDES. THE NOW A DARK CLOUD DESCENDS UPON. THIS CANNOT BE LEFT TO STAND THIS IS ONE THING ONE DECISION. THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE CHANGED. FOR THE FUTURE AMERICA. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS MINUTE TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS BILL AS THEIR BUREAUCRATS PICKING AND CHOOSING WINNERS AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU. THAT THIS ISSUE DIDN'T START WITH THE LEGISLATURE IT STARTS IT STARTED IN THE COURTS. AND IT STARTED IN THE COURTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED. TO BE GREEDY. AND THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR WORK FORCE. AND THEY TOOK ACTION. TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THE BENEFITS THAT ALL WORKERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION THE BENEFITS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR RETIREMENT AND SICK LEAVE AND VACATION LEAVE. AND MADE MISCLASSIFIED THEM ON PURPOSE. AND THE COURTS WHEN THEY HELD THEIR HEARING DETERMINED THAT THIS MISS CLASSIFICATION WAS. ILLEGAL OR MORE CORRECTLY WAS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THAT DAY THIS MISS CLASSIFICATION HURT THE EMPLOYEES AND SO THEY SET UP A NEW STANDARD AND THAT NEW STANDARD IS WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IF WE DO NOTHING TODAY THAT NEW STANDARD THE DYNAMIC STANDARD THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED ENDS UP AFFECTING ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED. AND SO IS THIS THE PERFECT SOLUTION NO IT'S NOT BUT I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF THAT SHE'S HAD WORKING WITH HER THAT HAVE GONE AND LISTENED DILIGENTLY TO ALL THE DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT IS EFFECTIVE THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED TO BECOME EMPLOYEES OR WHETHER THEY NEED TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO IS THE BILL FINISHED. NO IT'S NOT YOU HEARD THE AUTHOR COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THE NEXT YEAR BUT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT'S BETTER THAN THE DYNAMICS. DECISION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE WE WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CHANGETHAT TODAY SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER HARD WORK IN THIS AND TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO. IS TO BE TO PROTECT THE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND FELLOW MEMBERS I. HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL. I WANT TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY WHO IS A BUSINESS OWNER. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO KNOWLEDGE. THE FACT THAT THE DYNAMAX CORPORATION. WAS A 100% WRONG IN THE COURTS TO GOT IT RIGHT THEY WERE EMPLOYEES. AND A TEN NINETY NINE AND THAT'S WRONG. BUT THE TRUCKS THEY WERE DRIVING WERE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GVW AND UNDER. THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE OF YOU IN THIS BUILDING THAT DOESN'T HAVE A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S Là COMMERCIAL LICENSE CAN DRIVE THOSE TRUCKS. I HAPPEN TO BE AN OWNER OF A TRUCKING COMPANY. AND I BELIEVE I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THIS FLOOR THAT HAS A CLASS ONE LICENSE. THE DRIVE EIGHTY THOUSAND POUND VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA I MAY BE WRONG I STAND CORRECTED IF THERE IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS ONE. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE. DO YOU HAVE THAT A LICENSE TO DRIVE THAT TRUCK AND THEN WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO OWN THAT TRUCK. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEE A NUMBER. UNDER NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR. PERMITTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YET TO BE ENROLLED IN A DRUG PROGRAM YET TO BE TESTED RANDOMLY. WHATEVER YOUR NUMBERS DRAWN YET TO BE THE PULL NOTICE PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IF YOU HAVE A DRIVER THIS DRIVING YOUR VEHICLE AND GETS PULLED OVER YOU'RE NOTIFIED THAT THEY GOT PULLED OVER AND YOU'RE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CHURCH IN THE TRAFFIC. YOU HAVE TO BE A BIT INSPECTION WHICH IS ANOTHER HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR AND YOUR BI ANNUALLY INSPECTED EVERY NINETY DAYS YOU HAVE TO OF YOUR TRUCKS BED INSPECTED BY. A COMMERCIAL OFFICER. IT COST ABOUT SET BACK ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO LICENSE A TRUCK IN A COST ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH LICENSE AND INSURANCE TO ENSURE A TRUCK. THE PEOPLE THAT DRIVE TRUCKS THAT ARE OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GVW ARE IN BUSINESS. FOR REAL. NOW I WANT TO. SHARE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT. WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THIS BILL. WE TALKED ABOUT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE ARE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR. BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT ARE IN BUSINESS WE WOULD EXEMPT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE. I GOT INVOLVED IN AS MANY YOU KNOW I'M A FARMER. MY FAMILY HOMESTEAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I. HAVE LESS THAN TEN EMPLOYEES I'VE NEVER HAD ACTUALLY OVER FIVE THAT I'M AWARE OF. AND I'VE HEARD OF THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE. JUST RECENTLY TO THE SENATE BUT YOU KNOW WE HAD THE MINIMUM WAGE BILL AND I GOT UP AND SPOKE ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT MY WORKERS. AND I HEARD THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS YOU CAN AFFORD TO RAISE A FAMILY AND ALL THE MEN WHICH AND I AGREE HOW 2% BUT THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS NOT DESIGNED TO RAISE A FAMILY IT WAS A STARTING LEVEL WAGE. AND THEN I HEARD. THAT YOU FARMERS GET THE AG OVERTIME EXEMPTION HOW. IT AND THERE WAS A SPEECH ON THE FLOOR IN THE SEMI THAT REFERRED TO US AS SLAVE OWNERS. NOW WE USE THAT AG OVERTIME EXEMPTION FOR WHEN WE HARVEST AND WE PLAN. AND YES I WILL SURE THERE'S PROBABLY SOME. BAD APPLES OUT THERE THAT ABUSE THOSE SITUATIONS AND THERE'S BAD APPLES IN EVERY SINGLE PROFESSION. BUT THERE ARE LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE IN BUSINESS AND WANT TO BE THAT INDEPENDENT. TRUCK DRIVER FOR THAT. ANESTHESIOLOGIST WHO GOES FROM HOSPITAL HOSPITAL THAT PHYSICAL THERAPIST. SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT. SO MANY BILLS WHEN I THOUGHT OF THIS BILL AND I THOUGHT AM I GONNA MAKE AN IMPACT ON ANY INDIVIDUALS ON THIS FLOOR. WITH THE SPEECH FROM MY HEART. I'M NOT LEAVING CALIFORNIA. I WILL RUN MY BUSINESS UNTIL THIS BODY OR THIS LOW POLICY MAKING BODY RUNS BE OUT OF BUSINESS AND I'M NOT LEAVING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUSINESS ON ON THIS FLOOR AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO OPERATE A BUSINESS AND GIVE A JOB TO. THE MIDDLE CLASS OF THIS STATE. WE HAVE A PARK EXEMPTION FOR. UNION CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES BUT NOT EVERY BODY IN CALIFORNIA GETS A BUG IS IT BECAUSE THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS WANT OTHER BILLY TO GO HAMMER ON OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T LIKE SO WE DO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS HERE. WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD THAT. TOOK THE TRUCK THAT I HAVE. AND SAID IT WASN'T. COULD BE ON THE ROAD CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN BECAUSE OF AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. WHEN I BOUGHT IT MET THE MEETING OF THE LAW I BELIEVE THAT'S A TAKING DOWN THE CONSTITUTION BUT NOT HERE CALIFORNIA. WE CAN WE CAN WE CONTROL BE FOR THE BETTER OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR QUALITY. WE CAN MAKE YOU. RETROFIT YOUR VEHICLE. WE DID MAKE EVERYBODY THAT OWNED A CAR RETROFIT THERE'S BEEN JUST PEOPLE OWNS TRUCKS. OR CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. HI PAUL UNDER ALL THOSE RULES AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS SPEECH IS NOT GONNA CHANGE THE MINDS OF ANY PERSON ON THIS FLOOR. IS I'VE GIVEN IT MANY TIMES. SO I THOUGHT WHAT WHAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE MY STORY RESIGNATION. WITH THIS BODY AND THE BODY IN THE OTHER HOUSE. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS MAYBE IT'S TIME. THE DAIRY MEN IS GETTING REGULATED BY GROUND WATER. THE FARMER THE TRUCK DRIVER. THE END IS TO MAYBE WE NEED TO ORGANIZE MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT. WE ORGANIZE. YOU KNOW WHAT AND WE AND WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO NOT GIVE YOU YOU KNOW GET YOU YOU GET YOUR GLASS OF MILK AND YOUR LOAF OF BREAD. WHEN I GET THROUGH THIS. HELLO THE PERMIT PROCESS TO GIVE IT TO YOU. MAYBE WE SHOULD ORGANIZE MAYBE UBER LIFT SHOULD JUST TURN OFF THEIR- APP. IN LOTUS DEAL WITHOUT THEIR SERVICES THAT THEY GIVE. MAYBE THAT'S A SOLUTION MAYBE WE NEED TO. BRING A REALITY CHECK TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A DECENT JOB PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO FOR ALL THE THINGS I JUST STATED MEMBERS I LOVE YOU ALL I'VE INVITED YOU TO MY DISTRICT I TRY TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH YOU. ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN BUSINESS. I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING. NOW IN THIS ECONOMY TURNS IS GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE. PLEASE STOP PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING LET'S MAKE JUST LAWS. THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING IN TRYING TO PROVIDE A JOB FOR INDIVIDUALS. LET'S NOT GETTING BETWEEN ME AND MY EMPLOYEES. I DON'T NEED TO ME I DON'T NEED A BARGAINING UNIT BETWEEN ME AND MY EMPLOYEES I LOVE MY PLACE I WANT THEM TO PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE I WANT TO BUY A HOME I WANT TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM AS WELL. BUT THIS BODY. ISN'T AND- THE POLICIES ARE COMING OUT HERE. ARE NOT WORKING FOR MY LITTLE SMALL BUSINESS. SO I PLEAD WITH YOU. GIVE US SOME GRACE. GIVE US A BREAK. HIS WERE STRUGGLING IN IT IS DIFFICULT AND PLEASE LISTEN TO OUR STORY I URGE NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR LISTING. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF YOU BUT SOMETIMES I FIND MYSELF I CAN FALL DOWN A RABBIT HOLE. A RELATIVE RECENT RABBIT HOLE I FEEL DOWN WAS BASED ON SOMETHING I READ AND IT WAS IN INTRODUCED ME TO THIS CONCEPT OF CONFIRMATION BIAS. CONFIRMATION BIAS CONFIRMATION BIAS COLLEAGUES. IS WHEN YOU'RE DRAWN TO DETAILS THAT CAN FOR CONFIRM YOUR OWN EXISTING BELIEF. CONFIRMATION BIAS AM I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I QUITE FRANKLY THOUGHT ABOUT ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND HOW WILL WE STAND UP AND TAKE THE MY. OUR MESSAGES ARE SPEECHES ARE QUITE FRANKLY VERY PREDICTABLE. BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL SUFFER FROM CONFIRMATION BIAS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA FEED. OF WHAT COMES ON YOUR FEET. THE SOCIAL MEDIA FOLKS TO FIGURE IT OUT YOU I GET ARTICLES THAT CONFIRM TYPICALLY WHAT I ALREADY BELIEVE. SO RARELY ARE WE CHALLENGED TO STEP OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN LIFE-EXPERIENCE OUR OWN COURSE SET OF BELIEFS HOWEVER THERE WAS DOUBTLESS THE THINK DIFFERENTLY. WELL THE RESULT I'M WORKING VERY HARD. TO PUSH OUTSIDE MY OWN COMFORT ZONE MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE TO BREAK THROUGH THIS CONFIRMATION BIAS. AS A RESULT. I CONSCIOUSLY CHOSE TO WATCH A NEW DOCUMENTARY THIS WEEKEND. BY THE OBAMA FOUNDATION THEIR NEW FILM PROJECT CALLED AMERICAN FACTORY. AND IT IS THE STORY OF A FORMER AMERICAN AUTO FACTORY IN OHIO. THAT CLOSES IN A NEW BUSINESS OPENS. AND THE STORY OF THE IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION HAS ON THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS. WAS SHOCKING. AND MY TAKE AWAY. WAS THAT WORKERS ARE AT RISK. WORKERS ARE AT RISK BE IT AUTOMATION BE A GLOBAL OF GLOBALIZATION. OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WORK LOOKS LIKE AND WHO DOES WORK AND WHAT WORKERS CAN EXPECT. COULD VERY WELL BE CHANGING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. AS A FORMER EMPLOYER. OF AT ONE TIME FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AS A NONPROFIT LEADER I EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND. THE PROCESS THAT THE FLOOR JACQUI TALKED ABOUT BY WHICH A EMPLOYER RESPONSIBLY CLASSIFIES EMPLOYEES THERE ARE CLEAR GUIDELINES. PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES DECIDE TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT THEM BUT IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE THEIR CLEAR GUIDELINES AS AN EMPLOYER BY WHICH YOU CLASSIFY EMPLOYEES. I'M FINE AND OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID MOMENTS AGO THE DECISION QUITE FRANKLY COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN MADE DYNAMAX IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND THIS BILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS GOOD NEWS. BECAUSE IT PROVIDES PROTECTIONS AS APPROPRIATE. REPEATEDLY ARE I'VE HEARD PEOPLE REFERENCE TO THE NOTION OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IT'S A PHRASE WE USE OFTEN HERE. I HAVE TO ADMIT. THE MULTIPLE SETS OF AMENDMENTS THAT I HEARD READ THAT WERE LAYING ON THE TABLE DID THE SAME THING. IT WAS THE POLLS ALL TO PICK ADDITIONAL WINNERS AND LOSERS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP I TIP MY HAT TO THE AUTHOR AND ALL OF THOSE WHO WORK TIRELESSLY. TO THE FLOOR JACQUI TO TAKE THE MEETINGS TO DO THE HARD WORK OF FIGURING IT OUT I TIP MY HAT TO YOU AND I'M ALSO CLEAR THAT THIS. WILL VERY LIKELY NOT BE THE LAST TIME WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION ON THE FLOOR. THERE WILL BE MORE WORK TO DO. THAT COLLEAGUES HOWEVER SHOULD NOT STOP US. FROM DOING THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY WHICH IS TO CAST A VOTE IN SUPPORT. OF AB FIVE. WHICH I'LL BE PROUD TO DO AT THE APPOINTED TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES. I WASN'T BORN INTO A WEALTHY FAMILY I WAS BORN. TWO TWO WONDERFUL PARENTS BLUE COLLAR WORKERS MY DAD WAS A. SPREE PAINTER HAD A BUSINESS IN LOS ANGELES. PRESTIGE COMMERCIAL REFINISHING WAS NEVER A BUSINESS AT WHAT MADE MY DATA A MILLIONAIRE. HOW MY MOM WAS A DENTAL ASSISTANT WORK TWO NIGHTS A WEEK. REMEMBER MY DAD USED TO LEAVE A CHECK FOR MY MOM EVERY WEEK FOR TWO HUNDRED BUCKS. TWO HUNDRED BUCKS. SHOULD PAY THE HOUSE PAYMENT SHOULD PAY THE UTILITY PAYMENTS. SHOULD CLOSE MY SISTER MYSELF. THEY HAD TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND I'LL TELL YOU WE NEVER TOOK A FAMILY VACATION. MY ENTIRE LIFE BECAUSE WE CAN EVER FOR IT. BUT MY SISTER AND I WERE. SMOTHERED LOVE. AND MY PARENTS MADE THE COMMITMENT THAT THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A BETTER LIFE. THEN THEY DID. EMPLOYEE TODAY. MY MOM IS A TRAVEL AGENT. WORKED HER TAIL OFF. PUTTING ME THROUGH THE USC SCHOOL OF PHARMACY WHICH IS NOT A CHEAP. UNIVERSITY TO GO TO LEFT ME WITH NO DEBT. MY DAD COULD MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE HE BARELY KEPT THE FOOD ON THE TABLE. MY MONEY RAN OUT WHEN I WENT TO YOU SEE I AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND- CALL MY GRAMMA. FASTER IF I COULD LIVE WITH HER LOS ANGELES I COULD TRANSFER TO UCLA TO THE COULD AFFORD THE HOUSING ON CAMPUS. AND SHE SAID YES. MY GRANDFATHER HAD JUST PASSED AWAY SEVEN YEARS BEFORE. HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT IN THIS COUNTRY FROM RUSSIA. SEOUL CHOOSE. WORK FOR MULTIPLE SHOE STORES TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO OPEN HIS OWN SHOE STORE. OPENED EDWARDS FAMOUS BRAND SHOES. AND IT WAS NOW THE SANTA MONICA PROMENADE I'D. AND ARE NEVER FORGET GOING TO WORK WITH MY GRANDPA ON SATURDAYS WE CAN AFFORD TO GO A- SEGMENT ON THE GRAMMA GRANDPA'S HOUSE ON THE WEEKENDS AND- MY GRANDFATHER TAKE ME TO LUNCH I CAN'T TELL YOU THE THRILLED THAT I GOT TO BE WITH THAT MAN. WHO TAUGHT ME. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GOING TO SCHOOL IN THE IMPORTANCE OF. GETTING AN EDUCATION. AS I WENT THROUGH. MY DOORS AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE AS I WAS MOVING AND I WAS GOING TO DOORS AND I SAW HERE BRUSH AND HAD MY GRANDFATHER'S HERE'S A GRAMMAR WOULD YOU SUPPORT BUT TO KEEP THIS FOR GRANDPA'S BEEN DEAD FOR SEVEN YEARS AGO AS WELL AS SUCH SENTIMENTAL BUT- IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT. AND THEN AS I WENT TO THE DOOR TO EMPTY. MY TOILETRIES AND I FOUND HIS FALSE TEETH. AS A GRAMMAR REALLY HAVING FALSE TEETH IT'S TIME. THROUGH THE TRASH CANCERS A GET RID OF IT. BUT AS I. PUT THE TEETH INTO THE TRASH CAN I KIND OF SAW A BRIGHT SHEEN. AND I TURN THE TEETH OVER AND IT WAS A SOLID GOLD BRIDGE. THE MY GRANDFATHER HAD IT IS FALSE TEETH AND I SAID TO MY GRANDMOTHER SAID YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT IF YOU DON'T MIND I GOT A FRIEND THAT'S A JEWELER THAT I COULD HAVE A MELTED DOWN. BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT ME SUCH GREAT LESSONS ABOUT LIFE AND BUSINESS THAT. I LIKE TO WEAR IT AROUND MY NECK AND. AND HAVE MY GRAMPA AT IT WITH ME ALL THE TIME. MY FRIENDS. I HAVE A GOLD NUGGET AROUND MY NECK. MY GRANDFATHER CAME FROM NOTHING. MADE SOMETHING OUT OF HIMSELF. I GOT THE PHARMACY SCHOOL AND I WANTED TO FOLLOW MY GRANDFATHER'S. OF COMMENDATIONS. SO I GRADUATED PHARMACY SCHOOL I DID WORK ONE JOB. BUT ENDEAVOR TO JOBS. I DO WORK THREE JOBS I WORK FOR JOBS. AND I GOT A W. TWO FOR ONE. AND I WAS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR THREE. AND I SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY. THE BY FIXTURES. FROM PHARMACIES THAT WENT OUT OF BUSINESS THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER STORE CALLED GEMCO. OR TO A STORE CALLED FRANCO. I WANTED TO OPEN A CHAIN OF PHARMACIES AND I BOUGHT STORES FIXTURES AND STORE THEM IN. STORAGE INTEL I GUESS SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO OPEN MY FIRST PHARMACY. MY FIRST PHARMACY WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. I AM VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT I'VE BEEN THE PROUD OWNER OF SIX PHARMACIES AND I'VE DONE WELL. AND I'M VERY PROUD THAT I'VE DONE WELL. I FEEL LIKE I'VE A CHI THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND LIKE MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO HAVE A BETTER GENERATION FOR MYSELF. I WANT MY CHILDREN HAVE A BETTER GENERATION. THEN I HAD. WHY AM I BRINGING ALL THIS UP. IS BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE SEEING THE SICK THESE THESE ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES DISAPPEAR RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT DECISION NINE TO STAND THAT WE NEED TO. DO WE CAN TO COMPLY. BUT MY FRIENDS WE ARE THE LAWMAKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS THE LAWS THAT WE MAKE ON THE SENATE FLOOR THAT ARE INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS OF THIS LAND. AND WHILE MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. I HAVE TO STRONGLY DISAGREE. BUT I THINK WE HAVE. YOU KNOW I'VE. MARKED UNIONS OVER THE PAST WEEK AND. COMPLAINING ABOUT THE INFLUENCE THAT LABOR HAS OVER. OUR DECISIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT TWO OF THE PHARMACIES THAT I OWNED. HI UNIONIZED. I MADE THEM UNION PHARMACIES. BECAUSE I WAS TREATED VERY WELL AS A UNION PHARMACIST THE WORK FOR THRIFTY DRUG NOW WRITING THE WORK FOR GEN COLIN I WORK FOR THEM AS A EMPLOYEE I GOT GREAT BENEFITS SO I GOT GREAT WAGES AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAD GREAT PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME THAT WERE. THAT WERE WELL TREATED. BUT MY FRIENDS. THIS BILL. IS THE UNION CAUCUSES MAIN EVENT OF THE YEAR. WE'VE ALL HEARD THE PROTESTS. WE ALL OF SEEING THE HORRIBLE EFFECTS OF PASSING THIS BILL. WILL HAVE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. BY BASICALLY ENDING THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MODEL FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE TELLING FAMILIES YOU CAN NO LONGER WORK ON YOUR TERMS. AND YOUR CONDITIONS. THE STATISTICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY FRIENDS ARE NOT GOOD. THE U. S. CENSUS. DATA. US CENSUS CAME OUT TODAY WITH DATA SHOWING THAT. WE HAVE EIGHTEEN POINT 2% POVERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE IN SIX PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIVE IN POVERTY. GUESS WHAT. WERE SECOND ONLY TO WASHINGTON DC IT HAS TWO TENTHS OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF POVERTY THAN WE DO. MY FRIENDS WERE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE SO WE NEED TO TAKE AN ENTREPRENEURIAL APPROACH TO RUNNING GOVERNMENT. MORE REGULATIONS ISN'T ALWAYS GOOD. WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS WHO WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE WORKING IN THE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE STRONG CONCERNS EVEN MY COMPOUNDING BUSINESS IT AS THE REGULATIONS GET TOUGHER AND TOUGHER. THERE MAY BE A TIME THAT WE MAY HAVE TO CLOSE OUR DOORS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WORRY ABOUT ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO TRULY NEED COMPOUND AND MEDICATIONS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS IF I COULD. THE QUESTION TO THE FLOOR TALKING PLEASE. WE'LL ACCEPT THE QUESTION. I'LL TRY YES. THANK YOU MY FRIEND FROM FROM LOS ANGELES AND. I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME IF I CAN DISPLAY THIS IT'S A. AB FIVE FOUR EXEMPTION REQUEST FORM IT WAS DOWNLOADED. CAL MATTERS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION FORM GIVEN TO GROUPS SEEKING EXEMPTIONS. I LOVE I CAN BRING IT TO YOUR FOR YOU CAN SEE IT TODAY. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU. HI I HAVEN'T SEEN OKAY. DO YOU TO HAVE A QUESTION SIR YES I DO LEASE.WHO THIS APPLICATION GO TO GARNER THE EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SO GRANTED UNDER THIS BILL. OKAY. WHO EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL TO GET AN EXEMPTION. I DON'T KNOW ALL THOSE DETAILS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AUTOMATICALLY WHISPER TO THE TO AUTHOR. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THERE'S YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH AND YOU'RE NOT IN A COURT OF LAW THE QUESTION ASKS YOU IF YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T. OKAY WELL I DO KNOW THE ANSWER BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IT SAYS ON THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE FORM. THE AFL CIO SO. I CAN ONLY OPINED THAT. THESE APPLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY A LABOR UNION. NOT NECESSARILY EARLY BY THE AUTHOR TO DELIVER THESE EXEMPTIONS. I MEAN DO YOU THINK. IF THE LABOR UNIONS ARE REALLY GONNA PICK WHO'S GETTING EXEMPTIONS WAS NOT GETTING EXEMPTIONS A LEASE WOULD TAKE HER NAME OFF THE APPLICATION FORM. BUT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF TRANSPARENCY I GUESS IT'S GOOD THAT WE KNOW. I HAVEN'T BEEN. IN THE STATE CAPITALS LONG AS MANY OF YOU BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE. THAT THE AUTHORS OFFICES TURN THIS BILL INTO A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR LABOR UNIONS. THAT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE AN OFFICE RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. I MIGHT BE NAIVE BUT I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE DOCUMENTS HANDED OUT TO PEOPLE REQUESTING AN EXEMPTION. FOR AB FIVE THAT ARE PLAINLY PREPARED BY ORGANIZED LABOR THE AFL CIO TO BE SPECIFIC. BUT EVEN THOUGH THE PROCESS THE GODDESS HERE STINKS. I THINK THE BILL ITSELF IS FATALLY FLAWED. AB FIVE WILL MEAN THE END OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. SUPPORTERS WILL ARGUE THAT THIS BILL PROTECTS WORKERS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FRANCHISE OWNERS WHO LOSE THEIR FRANCHISES AND THEN HAVE TO FIRE THE WORKERS WHO DEPEND ON THEIR JOBS TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. BUT WHAT THE MAN OR THE WOMAN WHO WORKS A FEW HOURS ON THE WEEKEND FOR UBER LEFT OR DOOR DASH TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS ON THE SIDE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I HAVE TENANTS THAT WORK FOR UBER LEFT. A COUPLE OF THE MAKE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S THEY DO A GREAT JOB OF SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES. THAT WORK WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK AND DON'T WORK WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK. IT'S BEEN A GREAT GREAT MODEL FOR SINGLE MOMS. FOR SINGLE DADS. FOR PEOPLE THE NEED TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS SO THEY CAN FEED THEIR KIDS PUT THE KIDS IN POP WARNER FOOTBALL LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. OR WHAT ABOUT THE TRUCKER WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT TODAY. WHO SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BUY THEIR OWN TRUCK. SO THEY COULD DECIDE WHAT LOADS TO HAUL IT WOULD JOBS TO TAKE. IF THIS BILL GOES THROUGH. AND THEY HAVE TO BECOME EMPLOYEES OF LARGE TRUCKING COMPANIES. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET FOR THEIR TRUCKS. IF YOU'RE GONNA GET TOP VALUE FOR IT. WE'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY CAN SELL THE TRUCKS FOR WITH A. BY REQUIRING THESE PEOPLE TO BECOME EMPLOYEES THEY WILL BECOME. LIKELY. FORMER EMPLOYEES THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BEING EXPLOITED. SUPPORTERS ARE CLAIMING TO BE FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE THAT. MAKE THE LEAST THE MINIMUM WAGE WELL MY FRIENDS LET ME BE CLEAR. IN THIS CASE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IT'S NOT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. IT'S ZERO. THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE A PERSON WITHOUT A JOB MAKES ZERO. AND WILL BE MANY JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO BE LOST. WITH YOUR BROAD BRUSH FIVE VOTE. ON AB FIVE. JUST CONSIDER A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE HARMED BY THIS BILL GOING INTO EFFECT. THE TRUCKERS WHO WANT TO DECIDE WHAT THE HALL WHEN THE HOLIDAY WILL BE SHUT DOWN UNLESS THEY WANT TO BECOME EMPLOYEES SOMETHING. MANY DON'T WANT TO DO THE SINGLE FATHER WHO WANTS TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS WORKING NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK FOR A COMPANY LIKE UBER LIFT BECAUSE LEAVE BIG LABOR WANTS TO HAVE BAD BE A MEMBER. OF THE UNION. PHYSICAL THERAPIST TO HELP PATIENTS AT REASONABLE RATES WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND WORK UNLESS THEY BECOME FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. OF A HOSPITAL OR A REHAB CENTER. THEREBY LOSING THE FLEXIBILITY THE BROUGHT MANY OF THEM INTO THE PROFESSION. NOW I DON'T BLAME THE PEOPLE. WHO FELT FORCED TO CUT THEIR OWN SPECIAL DEALS. WITH BIG LABOR AND THIS AUTHOR. I DON'T BLAME THAT THE ARCHITECTS GOT THEIR CAR ABOUT FROM THIS POORLY DESIGNED BILL. I DON'T BLAME INVESTMENT ADVISORS WHO MADE SURE THEY WERE GOING TO BE SUED BY GREEDY TRIAL LAWYERS LOOKING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. I DON'T FAULT THE REALTORS. WHO MADE SURE THEY DIDN'T GET CAUGHT IN THE LABOR UNIONS SPIDER WEB SPUN BY THE BLACK WIDOW OF PUBLIC POLICY. NOR DO I THINK IT'S A BAD THING THAT THE TWENTY EIGHT OTHER SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS TO PAY THEIR TOLL TO THE LABOR UNION BOSSES GOT THE EXEMPTIONS. ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT COSTS THEM BUT I'M SURE. IT WASN'T FREE. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST REASON IS IT OPENS THE DOOR TO THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TARGETING BUSINESS OWNERS. AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING BY THE RULES. HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO PRESUME IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BILL. UNDER AB FIVE A DRIVER UBER WILL BE ABLE TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST UBER TO COLLECT FOUR YEARS OF BACK PAY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW. MANY OF YOU VOTE FOR TODAY MANY THOSE DRIVERS WHO MADE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WORKING FOR THESE COMPANIES. THIS RETROACTIVE CLAW BACK FOR WAGES IT ALSO COMES WITH MASSIVE PENALTIES WILL FORCE. MANY COMPANIES TO CLOSE ENTIRELY. THIS BILL OPENS THE DOOR FOR AGGRESSIVE TRIAL LAWYERS TO TARGET BUSINESSES MUCH LIKE. CURRENTLY GOES ON WITH LAWYERS TARGETING BUSINESSES WITH FRIVOLOUS ADA LAWSUITS WERE OPEN THE DOOR TO A DUPLICATION. OF THIS. DURABLE FRIVOLOUS FILING OF LAWSUITS TO GET SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT CAN ILL AFFORD TO PAY THE LEGAL FEES. SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE TRIAL LAWYERS ARE TO SEE BUSINESS USING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THE TRIAL LAWYERS CALL ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS IN GETS AND OR HER TO AGREE TO SOME FREE MONEY TO FILE A LAWSUIT. THE TRIAL LAWYER SENDS A DEMAND LETTER TO THE BUSINESS SAYING A LAWSUIT IS GONNA BE FILED UNLESS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CAN BE MADE THE TRIAL LAWYER THEN GETS HALF OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR GETS THE OTHER HALF MINUS THE EXPENSES OF FINDING A LAWSUIT ANY OTHER FEES. PAID BY THE TRIAL LAWYER. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LEARN AT THESE SHAKEDOWN LAWSUITS SHOULDN'T BE TOLERATED LET ALONE BE ENCOURAGED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. AS LONG AS THE BIG LABOR UNIONS AND TRIAL LAWYERS KEEP PAYING RENT TO CONTROL THIS LEGISLATURE I'M GUESSING THE ANSWER IS NEVER. SO IN CONCLUSION MADAMS PRESIDENT. AB FIVE AS A WAY TO FORCE PEOPLE OUT OF CAREERS THAT THEY LOVE AND CAREERS AT THE ENJOY IT'S A WAY TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO LABOR UNIONS THEY FRANKLY DON'T WANT TO JOIN. IT'S A WAY TO GIVE TRIAL LAWYERS NEW TARGETS NOW THAT THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF EIGHTY LAWSUITS TO FILE. IT'S A WAY TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL SHIP IN INNOVATION IS DEAD IN CALIFORNIA. LABOR UNIONS WHO OWN THIS LEGISLATURE ARE DESPERATE TO REPLENISH THEIR POLITICAL WAR CHEST IN LIGHT OF THE JANICE DECISION THAT SAID PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR POLITICAL SPEECH THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. MOST SHOCKINGLY THIS BILL MAKES A MOCKERY OF THIS LEGISLATURE HAVING ONE OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST LABOR UNIONS AND TRANSPARENT CONTROL OF DECIDING WHO GETS EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL IS FRANKLY. OFFENSIVE HAVING A ORGANIZED LABOR BOSS DECIDING WHAT'S BEST 485% OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WHERE THEY WANT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK FOR WHO THEY WANT TO PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE FREE. AND NOT BE TOLD TO DO SO BY BIG UNION BOSSES IN SMOKE FILLED ROOMS. SENATOR STONE LET'S WRAP IT UP AND STAY ON MESSAGE OR DIE SHOULDN'T SAY STAY ON MESSAGE STAY ON THE BILL IF YOU WOULD SIR. AND LET'S WRAP IT UP PLEASE FOR THOSE REASONS. I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ONE EIGHTY FIVE. SENATOR LEYVA. MEMBERS BEFORE I GET INTO THE MEAT OF WHY HAVE RISEN I WANT TO GIVE DIFFERENCE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER ND I THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY WITH US. AND I DID FEEL WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY THANK YOU. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I RISE IN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF AB FIVE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ON THIS FLOOR KNOWS HOW LONG. LAWYERS HAVE BEEN MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS FOREVER FOREVER. AND WHEN WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED WE ALL SUFFER AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE KNOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS THAT ARE MISCLASSIFIED. 70% THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER A HUGE NUMBER SO MEMBERS WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES WHO MISS CLASSIFY WORKERS TO CONTINUE TO PASS OUR OWN BUSINESS COSTS ON TO TAXPAYERS. AND RESPONSIBLE LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES COMPANIES THAT MS CLASSIFY THEIR WORKERS CALL THEM SMALL BUSINESSES YET THEY CONTINUE TO SET THE WORKERS RATES DIRECT TELL THE WORKER MUST TO THEIR JOB IMPOSE DISCIPLINE UPON THEM EVEN WHILE THE WORKERS TO THE MAIN WORK OF THE BUSINESS. THAT MAKES THEM AN EMPLOYEE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS AS CONTRACTORS IS A FORM OF UNFAIR COMPETITION. MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE DIRECTLY THREATENED BY THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND BY COMPETITORS TO BREAK THE LAW MANY OF US HAVE HEARD AND NO WE LEGISLATE TO THE BAD ACTORS THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS OUT THERE WHEN IT COMES TO WORKERS. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY AS A LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IT CLEARER WORKERS NEED JOB PROTECTIONS AB FIVE STRIKES A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA WORKERS FROM BEING DENIED THE RIGHT FOR WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS HOLDING BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE ALLOWING TRUE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND GOOD COMPANIES. TO STAY IN BUSINESS MEMBERS. FOR ME PERSONALLY I KNOW THAT WE HIT WE HEAR ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES TALK A LOT ABOUT LABOR UNIONS AND YOU'VE YOU'VE ALL HEARD MY OPINION ON THAT. I RAN FOR OFFICE FOR BILLS LIKE THIS I RAN FOR OFFICE SO THAT WE COULD HELP WORKERS BECAUSE WHEN WORKERS THRIVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US THRIVED AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE LIVE IN THRIVES. STILL I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIVE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE MY COMMENTS WILL BE VERY BRIEF BUT I WANT TO RAISE A ISSUE OF CONCERN I WANT TO FIRST COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT SHE'S DONE TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE COLLABORATED TO BRING FORTH THIS LEGISLATION BUT IF IT'S TRUE THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD I'M GONNA RAISE CONCERN ABOUT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY THAT I'VE- BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND JUST SHARE SOME CONCERNS OF. MANY OF MY FRIENDS WERE PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS WHO ARE NOT I'M PLOYS OF A LABEL OR NOT EMPLOYEES OF A STUDIO AND THEY ARE OUR A AND I KNOW THERE WAS THE EFFORT. TO INCLUDE THEM AND I JUST WOULD ASK THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE REVISIT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS LOSE IS RICH INDUSTRY THAT. HAS GROWN UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA I AT AND FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE A LIVING WHETHER THEIR STUDIO MUSICIANS ARE BACKGROUND SINGERS. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK AT OUR FREELY AS THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST. FIFTY SIXTY YEARS SINCE THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN GROWING HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I JUST. ASK FOR THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING FOR YOU WORKING WITH YOU IN THAT EFFORT. SENATOR BILL. I'M A PROUD SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL I THINK THAT. WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE A COURT DECISION TO DO THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION TO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE. HELPED IF WE- CODE OF. GONE THROUGH IN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND DO A GREAT GRAN PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT FURTHERS SO. A NEW ISSUE THAT'S VERY THAT'S KIND OF BEEN HANGING OVER CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME I'M I'M A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND I'VE SEEN CALIFORNIA CHANGE AND ONE OF THINGS I'M MOST PROUD OF. OF OUR STATE IS THE DIVERSITY WE HAVE IN OUR STATE THE DIVERSITY OF AREAS CULTURES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD LIVING HERE LANGUAGES AND MY DISTRICT AND SALAS A WE HAVE TO SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BEING SPOKEN. IN THE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK YOU DO WITH THAT DIVERSITY AND WITH THAT THAT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL REALLY ADDRESSES AND THAT IS THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE CHEATED OR EXPLOITED OR ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR WAGE AND NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY SHOULD DESERVE. AND IT SHOULD BE BASED ON. THOSE KINDS OF STANDARDS THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS WE SHOULD HAVE CLEAR STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT THIS BILL DOES THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE I WANT TO RAISE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN RAISED BY. MY COLLEAGUES IS TO CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS. ONE OF THE HIGHEST ON THE HIGHEST RATES OF POVERTY. IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE A SUCH A HIGH RATE OF POVERTY WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING. ADD POVERTY OR ABOUT TO BE ON POVERTY. AND SO ARE WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THIS ISSUE WITH THIS BILL WE SHOULD PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO PROTECTING THEIR WAGES THEIR BENEFITS. AND STANDING UP FOR THOSE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT IF WE DON'T STAND UP FOR WILL SLIP EVEN FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO POVERTY. I THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL I'M SURE. IS SUCH A GRAND. GRAND MOVEMENT I CALL IT. I WANTED TO POINT OUT. SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON INDUSTRIES LIKE THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THIS CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS HERE. WE GOT A GOOD START WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AMENDMENT I THINK THERE'S MANY OWNER OPERATORS STAT RUN FREIGHT SO OF HAULING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS DOING THINGS YOU KNOW CLEANING UP OUR COMMUNITIES THEM FIRES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUILDING OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS WITH SP ONE FUNDS. SO THEY ARE THEY'RE ALSO ON THE PHONE FOR A LOT OF THE- NEW CLEAN AIR STANDARDS ARE THEY THEY HAVE BORROWED MONEY TO UPGRADE THEIR TRUCKS OR EVEN BUY NEW TRUCKS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DEBT AT THIS POINT. AND WE ALSO HAVE. OF COURSE THE TRUCKERS PAY WAIT FEES SO ONE OF THINGS ABOUT THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS THE- FACT TO THEIR PREPONDERANCE OF. FINDING OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS REALLY UNDERNEATH. THE BUDGET IT'S DEPENDED ON THOSE WEEK FEES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE COLLECT AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS HEALTHY AS WE CAN. SO I'M SUPPORT ARMS I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF. CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION. OVER THE RECESS WITH THEM. AND I WANT TO I WANT TO SAY THIS WE'VE ALL HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES MY AND- MY FAMILY WITH. THE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND I HAD. WE'VE HAD ALL THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES WITH. OF OURSELVES AND OUR FRIENDS AND HAD. UNFAIR TREATMENT IN THE HIGH TECH INDUSTRY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF. THE WAY WE WERE PAID AND TAKEN CARE OF. AND I THINK THIS BILL SINCE THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO WE SHOULD ALL CONSIDER THIS AS THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE NEED TO GO AND IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE DIVERSE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE AND I'M WILLING TO WORK ACROSS SO I WITH ANY OF OUR OUR COLLEAGUES TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION THAT THAT IS BEING RAISED TODAY ON THAT ISSUE. SO I HEARD SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL LET'S LET'S MOVE AHEAD LET'S LET'S DO THIS FOR CALIFORNIA OUR DIVERSE STATE THAT NEEDS. THE NEEDS THIS DIRECTION AND I OR CHEN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO FIRST AND FOREMOST LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATE HUNTER FROM CHINO WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE YOUNG. MISS CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS TO THE AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR MANAGER AND CERTAINLY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM CHINO WHO HAVE A GREAT PASSION. TO PROTECT WORKERS MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT DOES THE OPPOSITE FOR THOSE WHO DO OR WISH TO BE INDEPENDENT BOB DID MISS CLASSIFIES SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE TRULY ARE IN SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS NOW AS EMPLOYEES AND THAT IS. PRETTY HARMFUL ODD TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO US ARE FROM VARIOS INDUSTRIES ASKING US TO GET AN EXEMPTION THE BILL REALLY NEEDS MORE WORK I KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO DO THAT. IT NEEDS TO BE NARROWED SO THAT IT PROTECTS WORKERS ARE WHO ARE EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO PROTECTS THAT HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCING SO MUCH WHAT INCOME SO MANY JOBS ARE SO MANY BENEFITS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THEY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED TO AND BE PROVIDED PROTECTIONS SO WE NEED MORE WORK ON THE US AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE- FOLLOWING YEAR WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT. FOR TO NIGHT SO I WILL BE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR BATES SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANTED TO. KIND OF SUMMARIZE SOME THOUGHTS IN IN FIRST OF ALL AGREE WITH OUR GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS. WHEN SHE STATED THAT THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE TONIGHT AND IN THIS SITUATION IS BECAUSE OF A COURT CASE. IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT AND WHAT CONCERNS ME SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CASE. AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED AND I AGREE WITH THE DYNAMAX WAS ABOUT OPERATOR ACCORDING TO THE LAW AT THE TIME REGARDING EMPLOYEES VERSES INDEPENDENT OPERATORS. IN MY OPINION THE SUPREME COURT AT THAT POINT TIME SHOULD HAVE JUST DEALT WITH THE DYNAMAX. ANNA JUDICATA WHAT THEIR PENALTY AND WAS FOR THEIR- MISGIVINGS AND THEY'RE BREAKING OF THE LAW. BUT WHAT RISES TO A HIGHER CONCERN FOR ME IS. HOW BAD THIS DECISION REALLY IS. BASED ON LAW BASED ON APPLICATION BASED ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. I'M AFRAID. THERE AS THIS CASE IS STUDIED IN LAW SCHOOLS AND IN TEXT BOOKS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS IS GONNA GO DOWN IN HISTORY OR AT LEAST MODERN HISTORY IS ONE OF THE VERY WORST DECISIONS AT% THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS EVER MADE AND WE GET ON THE BILL. AND I THINK A LOT OF US ACTUALLY AGREE ON THAT. BUT WHAT WE CONCERNS ME EVEN MORE THAN THAT. IS THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS DECISION. WE HAVE SEVEN HIGHLY TRAINED COMPETENT SINCE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM GOT THIS DECISION WRONG. AND THE CONCERN FOR ME ON THAT IS. WHERE IS THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT ON THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. WHERE IS THE DEBATE AMONGST OUR OUR CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. BUT NOT EVEN ONE DESCENDED ON THIS BAD DECISION. THAT BRINGS US HERE TONIGHT AND. AND I I'M ACTUALLY LESS CRITICAL OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AUTHOR I THINK HAS GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE IN THE EXEMPTIONS THAT THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO OFFER. BUT YOU JUST CAN'T EXIT YOU THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. TO MANAGE AN ENTIRE TWO TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY FROM THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY IS NOT POSSIBLE. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE ON INTENT OR MAYBE EVEN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. SO IF I MAY MANTRAS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR GENUINE QUESTION REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. DO YOU WISH TO TAKE A QUESTION SENATOR TRYING YES I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED IN IN IT BECAUSE I KNOW I WASN'T INANY THE HEARINGS ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE NOW GOING TO BE UNDER THIS BILL AND DON'T HAVE AN EXEMPTION. BUT THE IRS RECOGNIZES THEM AS A TEN NINETY NINE OR AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. IN ON APRIL FIFTEENTH WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THEM TO DO THEIR TAXES HOW ARE THEY GONNA RECONCILE STATE LAW. THAT SAYS THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE AN EMPLOYEE AND FEDERAL LAW THAT SAYS IF THEY'RE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. OKAY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHAT WILL BE BY USED IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A TEN NINETY NINE OR W. TO FORM. THAT WILL BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR OKAY BYE PROCEED THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT WHICH OF COURSE IS SOMEWHAT CONTROLLED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON THAT WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS COMING UNDER THE THIS BILL. A COUPLE MEMBERS HAVE A SHARED HOW THIS IMPACTS THEM. PERSONALLY LET ME SHARE HOW IT IMPACTS ME PERSONALLY. I HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE. SO I'VE WORKED FOREVER IS A TEN NINETY NINE. THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR GOOD NEWS FOR ME I'M EXEMPTED. MY WIFE RUNS TWO BUSINESSES SHE RUNS A. HOME HOME INTERIOR DECORATING BUSINESS AND SHE RUNS A. HEALTH FOOD GROCERY BROKERAGE BUSINESS WITH HER FATHER IN LAW. NO I THINK I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT IT FIGURED OUT THAT ON HER INTERIOR DECORATING BUSINESS YEAH SHE MEETS THE A. B. C. TEST BUT ON THE BUSINESS THAT SHE RUNS WITH HER FATHER IN LAW AS FAR AS BROKERAGE TO GROCERY STORES. HEALTH WOOD GROCERY STORES I MIGHT ADD. THAT THE BUSINESS IS BASED IN ARIZONA. SHE WORKS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY CONTRACT WITH MULTIPLE COMPANIES AROUND NOT IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA COLORADO NEW YORK MULTIPLE COMPANIES THAT ARE HEADQUARTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN AND ACTUALLY THE GLOW. WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR MY WIFE AND I TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO OUR TAXES IN APRIL FIFTH ON APRIL FIFTEENTH I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION BUT AM VERY FEARFUL THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD AS ALL OF THAT. BECAUSE SOME OF THESE COME MOST OF THE COMPANIES THAT SHE CONTRACTS FOR AREN'T IN CALIFORNIA. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS HERE TO TRY TO CONTROL A TWO TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY. FROM THE FROM THESE HALLS I THINK IT'S AN AMBITIOUS GOAL. BUT WE JUST CAN'T DO IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AND I'D ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON AB FIVE AND LET'S TAKE THE TIME TO GET THIS RIGHT AND SEND IS IF WE HAVE TO SEND STUFF BACK. TO THE COURTS LET'S DO THAT. ANY FURTHER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION SENATOR GALGIANI. THANK YOU I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT IT'S AFTER MUCH ANGST AND THE AUTHOR KNOWS THAT I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH HER ABOUT CONCERNS FROM SMALL TRUCKERS IN MY DISTRICT THESE ARE THE LETTERS THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM INDIVIDUALS FROM MY DISTRICT OVER TIME THIS THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE NOT THE SAME ISSUES THAT THAT YOU EXPERIENCE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LA POURED IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. AND WE HAVE MANY TRUCKERS THAT WORK FOR OTHER COMPANIES WHO STARTED SMALL ALL THIS TALK ABOUT MISTER ALL NUNES FROM MY DISTRICT TOO MANY MANY YEARS AGO BOUGHT HIS FIRST TRACK AND HE'S WORKED HARD AND HE SAVED IN THE BOTTOM THE OTHER TRUCK AND TODAY HE'S CLOSE TO RETIREMENT HE HAS THIRTY TRUCKS OF HIS OWN AND WHEN IT'S TIME WHERE THAT WHEN THE AG SEASON IS FLOWING AND THINGS ARE GOING HE NEEDS TO HIRE. ADDITIONAL TRUCKERS FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME HE'S ABLE TO DO THAT AND MY FORMER NEIGHBOR AND MERCED COUNTY WORKED VERY VERY HARD TO BUY A TRUCK USED TO BRING HIS TRUCK COMMON PARK IT IN THE DRIVEWAY NEXT TO MY HOME AND HE HE DREAMS LIKE MANY OF OUR DREAMERS OF GROWING AND WORKING HARD TO START IS BUSINESS AND BE ABLE TO HIRE SOMEBODY SOME DAY AND BE LIKE SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT HAVE GROWN INTO A BUSINESS. I'VE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN ENTER THE PIPELINE OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY WOULD BE EITHER INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY A LOT OF TRUCKS AND START A BUSINESS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD INHERIT. A BUSINESS FROM THEIR PARENTS. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WORKED HARD. SO I WAS PREPARED TO KNOW TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL TODAY FOR THAT REASON AND SOME OTHERS BUT IN TALKING TO THE AUTHOR AND TALKING TO BUILDING TRADES AND TO THE LABOR FEDERATION I RECOGNIZE THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE THAT THE TIME HASN'T ALLOWED FOR EVERYTHING TO BE ADDRESSED BUT- THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND A RECOGNITION. THAT IT ISN'T PERFECT AND THAT WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON IT AND IT'S EASY TO ALWAYS FIND FAULT WITH THINGS AND I'VE DONE THAT THIS WHOLE TIME THAT WE'VE HAD THE CONVERSATION I WISH TO SAY THE TO THE AUTHOR TODAY THAT I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN THE LABORS TRYING TO ADDRESS TO. YOU KNOW HELP THE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN CHEATED WHO HAVE BEEN CHEATED OUT OFWAGES WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER DEPLORABLE WORKING CONDITIONS I RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I APPLAUD THAT I RESPECT THAT I ALSO THANK YOU AND RESPECT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MYSELF AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS THOSE WHO COME HERE TO THAT WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THAT WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE WE'RE PROMOTING JOB CREATORS THAT START SMALL WORK HARD LIKE OUR PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS DID AND ONE DAY THEY THEN CAN HIRE OTHERS WHO CAN WORK FOR THEM AND THEY WILL TREAT THEM WELL UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF AB FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PRO TEM ATKINS THANK YOU I'LL BE VERY QUICK MADAM PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS BEEN A MOST INTERESTING DISCUSSION TONIGHT. IT'S GONNA DIRECTIONS I ABSOLUTELY NEVER ANTICIPATED. I DO HAVE TO SAY. I'M CONVINCED OF ONE THING I'M VERY GLAD THAT THE SPEAKER AND I DECIDED LAST YEAR NOT TO TAKE THIS UP AT THE END OF SESSION. BECAUSE WE'VE HAD AN ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE YEAR TO DO THIS WORK. AND YET HERE WE ARE TONIGHT WITH THIS AGAIN I WILL SAY INTERESTING CONVERSATION PEOPLE RAISE SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS DURING THE DISCUSSION AND I KNOW. THAT THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS HAVE HEARD THOSE POINTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO HEAR. AND THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS DO YOU WANT TO TAKE BEFORE WE BRING SOMETHING FORWARD THAT ACTUALLY TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. OF THE- CATEGORIES OF WORKERS THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS. I'VE LEARNED A FEW THINGS IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE STAFF. BACK HERE WHO'VE BEEN AGAINST THE WALL ALL NIGHT WHO EVERY TIME I'VE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT ANY CATEGORY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THEM COME IN AND EXPLAIN TO ME. THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS AROUND THE BRELO CASE THAT LED TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN THE CONFUSION AND THE DISAGREEMENTS I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AS ARE A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. BUT I ANNOUNCED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE COURT CASE THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WE ARE ONE. AND THE UPREME COURT HAS THE ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE. I IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND BRING ABOUT FAIRNESS. OF THE AUTHOR DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ON ANY OF THIS WE COULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT AS IT WAS. AND THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE. CONCERNED THE MINUTE THE CASE CAME DOWN. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THOSE BUSINESSES WE TALK ABOUT SUPPORTING. GOING TO SAY DOES THIS APPLY TO ME WE NEED CLARITY WE NEED THE ABILITY TO HELP CATEGORIES OF WORKERS UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY FIT INTO THIS AND I AM JUST GOING TO SAY I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS I'VE HAD MANY. AND I'VE WATCHED IT AS THIS HAS PROCEEDED THIS YEAR AND I'M JUST GONNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO THE STAKEHOLDERS ALL OF THEM WHO ENGAGED NOT JUST FOR A WEEK OR TWO BUT THROUGHOUT THIS LONG LEGISLATIVE YEAR. AND LABOR. ABSOLUTELY THE CHAMBER. ARE IT IS THE JOB OF LABOR TO LOOK OUT FOR WORKERS. HI IT IS THE JOB OF BUSINESS. LIKE THE CHAMBER TO LOOK OUT FOR CATEGORIES OF BUSINESSES AND IF WE DID ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN LAWS THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE IN PLACE TO PROTECT WORKERS IN BUSINESSES. WE ARE PAID TO DO THIS COMPLICATED WORKING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND ARGUE AND DEBATE. AND NEGOTIATE AND COMPROMISE AND COME TO SOME. MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS FOR CATEGORIES OF WORKERS AND WE'VE TRIED TO DO THAT AND WE DID NOT. GET TO EVALUATE EVERY CATEGORY OF WORKER AND MANY OF US HAVE PLEDGED TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS WE WOULD ANTICIPATE DOING. BECAUSE IT IT WAS FOUND TO BE WAY MORE COMPLEX THAN I THINK ANY OF US IMAGINED. SO OF THE OF THE STORIES THAT CAME OUT TONIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA. PUT INTO THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHICH IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO. THE STAKEHOLDERS THE TENSION THE DISCUSSION MAKES HAS COME FORWARD WITH A BETTER PROCESS. AND SO I WILL JUST THANK THE INDIVIDUALS THAT REALLY DUG IN. AND MADE A COMMITMENT MADE A COMMITMENT TO SEE THIS THROUGH AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESS. BUT YOU KNOW IN THE WORDS OF JOHN F. KENNEDY THERE ARE NO WISE MEN HERE THERE'S US. THERE'S JUST US. AND I THINK WE DO A PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB. EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE AND WITH THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS THEN COMMIT YOURSELF TO GET ENGAGED TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE STAKEHOLDER WORK. SO THAT MAYBE WE CAN DO IN EVEN BETTER JOB. GOING INTO NEXT YEAR BUT I IN AND- OUT WHERE I STARTED WITH A THANK YOU TO THE INCREDIBLE STAFF THAT HAVE WORKED ON THIS. TO ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTED AND TO THE AUTHOR. AND THE- FLOOR MANAGER. OF FOR WALKING US THROUGH THIS IS CNN MEMBERS I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS SEEING NO FURTHER MIKE'S UP SENATOR DRAWS SO. DO YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL I HAVE I WROTE A LOT OF NOTES FROM DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE SAID AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE. YOU BEAT ME TO WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY MADAM PRESIDENT. BUT I DO I DO HAVE THE SIX A COUPLE OF THINGS VIEW BEAR WITH ME. THE SOMEONE SAID IN THEIR REMARKS THAT. SOME OF THESE. MEN AND WOMEN THAT HE KNOWS ALL THEY WANTED WAS THE CHANCE TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS TO PUT TO FEED THEIR KIDS. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY SUMS UP WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. IS THE ABILITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO RAISE A FAMILY. IN A WAY THAT AND JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH. AND I LOVE THAT BECAUSE- ONE JOBS SHOULD BE ENOUGH. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE TWO THREE OR FOUR JOBS AND WE SHOULD HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT PROVIDES FOR THAT. AND YES EVERYBODY WILL STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOBODY'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENT SOMEONE FROM STARTING THEIR OWN COMPANY WHICH I THINK IS TO BE APPLAUDED INCLUDING THE A TRUCK DRIVER. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS I THINK THE COURTSMADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT. THEY'RE PRETTY FED UP WITH THE BAD ACTORS IN THE ECONOMY AND THEY WANTED CLARITY FOR EVERYBODY. SO LET'S. SPECT AND APPRECIATE THAT. WORKERS YES ORGANIZED WORKERS. FIREFIGHTERS AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE JANITORS ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THIS PROCESS WITH BUSINESSES AND THE STATE. AND CAME UP WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE I THINK VERY GOOD PROPOSAL FOR US. AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESSED EVERY ISSUE BUT KNOWING THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS I DO. AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE OF OUR PRO TEM I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS LEGITIMATE. CONCERNS SO WITH THAT THIS DESERVE BROTHERS ONE JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. ALL DEBATE HAVING ACTUALLY SEE STE. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN.
