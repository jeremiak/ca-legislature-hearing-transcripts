BACK EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:55.119
BECAUSE THE SOMEBODY'S MADE

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.821
HOUSING A PRIORITY. BUT ONE OF

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:57.889

ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS BUT IT'S

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.532
ULTIMATELY LOOKING AT THE ROOT

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.200
CAUSES A LOT OF WHICH GOES BACK

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:11.069

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.271

BREAK THOSE CYCLES WE HAVE TO

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.083
HELP THE FAMILIES WE HAVE TO

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.518
HELP THE CHILDREN. AND THEN

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:30.321
THAT. REDUCES THE AMOUNT WHO

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.889
WILL. TEND TO FALL INTO

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:34.392
HOMELESSNESS. FUTURE SO FOR

00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:36.828
THIS POPULATION. PROPER LEVEL

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:40.999

PUT A TO ADDRESS HOMELESS YOUTH

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.648
IN THE BUDGET THE LAST SEVERAL

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.850
YEARS HASN'T HAPPENED. SO

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.551
UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO RAISE

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:01.919

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:06.724
UNIQUE TO OUR HOMELESS YOUTH

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:07.925
POPULATIONS THAT I'M AFRAID

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:08.893
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.962

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:31.862
THEIR CHILDREN WERE ALSO

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:32.963
COUNTED LIVING OUTSIDE

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.566
CALIFORNIA- HAS OUR YOUNG

UNTIL THIRD THAN ALMOST ANY

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:41.405
OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. I'M

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:41.972
LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:44.542
EDUCATION DATA. A TWO HUNDRED

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.143
AND SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS OUR

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.411

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:49.680
SCHOOLS- AS EXPERIENCING

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:51.615
HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT IN

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:52.550
THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:55.186
SCHOOL YAR. AND WE KNOW BOTH

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.654
HUD'S POINT IN TIME COUNT

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.924
NUMBERS AND THE DEPARTMENT THE

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.424
CASE NUMBER IS TO BE AN

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:03.127
UNDERCOUNT. WE LOOK AT OUR HIGH

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.129
PATIENT THE STUMP I HEARING CAL.

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.164
ONE IN TWENTY YOU SEE STUDENTS

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.366
ONE IN TEN CSU STUDENTS AND ONE

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.701

STUDENTS EXPERIENCES HOMELESS

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:13.971
AT SOME POINT DURING THE COURSE

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:16.040
OF THE YEAR. SO WHAT'S UNIQUE

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.808
YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS RIGHT

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:18.442
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.744
FOR THIS POPULATION. I'M THEY

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:21.278
MAY OR MAY NOT USE ADULTS

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.981
SERVICES- OR IF THEY DO THEY

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:24.748
MIGHT NOT BE CERTAIN

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.816
DEVELOPMENTS THE APPROPRIATE

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:28.185
WAYS FORWARD WHERE THEY'RE AT

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.887
IN LIFE. THEY'RE OFTEN LACKING

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:32.122
RENTAL AND EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.458
AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT LIFE

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.228
SKILLS AND UNABLE TO AFFORD

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:38.462
MARKET RATE RENTS. I OFTEN

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:39.730
ATTACHED TO FAMILIES ALSO.

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.498
HOMELESSNESS OR IN MANY CASES

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:43.033
ARE UNACCOMPANIED MEANING THAT

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.435
THEY'RE NOT IN THE CARE OF A

00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:46.837
PARENT OR GUARDIAN. SO WHO

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.706
EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS WE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.808
HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS-

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:53.077
SO LGBTQ YOUTH AND YOUTH OF

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.078
COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:56.013
AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.782
ARE OVER REPRESENTED- IN LARGE

00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:59.383
PART DUE TO SYSTEM

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.719
DISCRIMINATION. PREGNANT AND

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.320
PARENTING YOUTH ARE ALSO REALLY

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.255
OVER REPRESENTED IN THIS

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:06.156
COMMUNITY AND ARE UNDER SERVED

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:08.559
IN COMMONLY OVERLOOKED BY A LOT

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.261
OF OUR HOMELESSNESS SYSTEMS. A

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.862
YOUTH EXIT BUT WELFARE AND

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.964
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS OFTEN

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.900
EXIT INTO HOMELESSNESS OR HAVE

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:18.736
EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS. SO

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:19.236
HOW DO THESE YOUNG FOLKS

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:21.372
SURVIVE ON THE STREETS. WELL

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.573
SOME MAY NEED TO TURN TO

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.842
SURVIVAL SEX FOR A PLACE TO

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.644
STAY OR IN EXCHANGE FOR OTHER

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.545
BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD MONEY OR

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:30.381
CLOTHING. LACKING A PERMIT

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.616
ADDED MAY BE EXCLUDED. FROM

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:34.551
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:35.953
AND THAT'S THE CASE WE NEED TO

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.289
TURN THE LENS BACK ON OURSELVES

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.523
AND ASK WHAT THE LATTER'S

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.557
OPPORTUNITY ARE THAT ARE

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:42.593
AVAILABLE. YOUNG PEOPLE RATHER

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.996
THAN VILIFY OR CRIMINALIZE THEM

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:46.563
FOR PARTICIPATING IN ACTS OF

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:51.502
SURVIVAL. ONE THING WE KNOW IN

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:53.771
CALIFORNIA ABOUT 50% OF

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:55.105
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS

00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:56.373
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS BEFORE

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.509
THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR SO IS

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:00.077
REALLY KEY TO MENTION THIS GAME

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.545
I THINK OF PREVENTION. NO THE

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:02.579
HOMELESS DOES DURING

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:04.148
ADOLESCENCE DISRUPT THE

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.883
DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.451
LIVING SKILLS AND CREATES

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.954
LIFELONG REPERCUSSIONS NOT ONLY

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.988
EMPLOYABILITY AN EDUCATIONAL

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.590
ATTAINMENT BUT ALSO THE GREAT

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:15.292
HEALTH AND WELLNESS- WHICH

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.728
INCREASES RISKS OF SUICIDE AND

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:19.730
SUBSTANCE OVERDOSE WHICH WE

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:20.297
KNOW TO BE KIND OF THE TWO

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.666
HIGHEST BECAUSE THE MORTALITY

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:24.568
FOR THIS COMMUNITY. SO IT WORKS

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:25.536
FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND I

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.804
WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS A BIT

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.340
IN HE FUTURE PANELS BUT LONG

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:31.041
TERM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING-

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.210
RAPID RE HOUSING. OTHER TYPES

HAVE GREATER NEEDS DEDICATED

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.750
STATE FUNDING AS WE'VE SEEN IN

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:40.784
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:43.420
THROUGH HE'D BEEN HAP- WE'VE

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:44.888
HEARD TO THERE'S MORE NEED TO

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.357
CONSULT WITH PROVIDERS ARE

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.791
WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THIS

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:48.859
COMMUNITY. AND THE DEVELOPMENT

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:51.929
OF THOSE FUNDING FRAMES. OF

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.731
YOUTH CARVE OUTS HAVE BEEN

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.299

THE MEN AND APES ON YOUTH SNUS

IN WRECKED. STORE KIND OF LACK

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.704
OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS YOUTH

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.439
HOMELESSNESS IN PARTICULAR.

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.008
WE'VE ALSO SEEN TINY HOMES AND

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:04.975
HOST HOMES IT'S KIND OF

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.511
INNOVATIVE TRAGEDIES HAPPENING

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:08.112
A DIFFERENT COMMITTEES ACROSS

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.414
THE STATE. SOME OF THE BARRIERS

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.516
ARE WHAT'S MISSING OF WHAT WE

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:13.851
HEAR A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:16.487
MORE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

A THINGS LIKE THE SCHOOL TO

PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.110
ACCESSING EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.547
AND HOUSING. THERE IS A NEED

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:44.648
FOR HARM REDUCTION EFFORTS

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:46.083
MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.551
OTHER LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO

AND WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.992
UNDO WHAT IS WHAT IS NEED TO

THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL COST

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.404
EFFECTIVE STRATEGY BUT IT'S

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:10.374
UNDER RESOURCE. AND LASTLY WE

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.375
NEED TO LISTEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.342

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:13.811
HOMELESSNESS IN ALL OF OUR

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:15.813

THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW. WHAT

SORT OF MINOR CHANGES AND

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:15.405
TRAJECTORIES I THINK WE CAN ALL

THEY'RE SEEING SORT OF A

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.433
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.801
THAT FELL THROUGH WHERE THEY

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:18.869
WANT TO TWEAK SOMETHING THAT'S

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:19.903
WORKING BETTER. WE'VE BEEN

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.804

THAT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT AND SO.

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.041
WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE A GREAT

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.509
SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:26.743
FUNDING IS ACTUALLY BEEN PUT

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:27.878
TOWARDS HOME USE HOMELESS.

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.746

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.148
OF THE FUNDING I PERIOD NEXT

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.817
JUNE. BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.052
WE HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY.

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.820
ENCOURAGING SIGNAL FROM MY FULL

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.524
OF CAN YOU. IS I JUST A LOT OF.

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:41.792
IN NUMBER HAS DOUBLED THERE WAS.

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:43.227
ASIDE WITH ORIGINALLY REQUESTED.

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:45.395
YAGO FAR. MONTEREY A HANDFUL OF

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.097
THE UC'S HAVE ALREADY SORT OF

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:48.131
INCREASE FROM WHAT THEY

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:48.999
ORIGINALLY PROJECTED THEY WOULD

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.567
SPEND. I AND YOU THOMAS AND

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.035
PROGRAM WHICH I THINK IS A

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.070
REALLY GOOD SIGNAL THAT THEY'RE

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:53.770
SEEING SOME THINGS THAT.

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:56.840
WORKING OR ARE THAT A GREATER

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:57.474
NEED THAN THEY EXPECTED AS THEY

00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:02.980
STARTED TO START. THE YOUNG AND

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.081
SO PERHAPS THE ASSET FOR THOSE

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:04.681
OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW AT PART

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:05.282
OF THE HEAT STATURE. WERE IS

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.984
THAT THEY SUBMIT OVERLY. TO OUR

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.452
BUT WE RECEIVE THOSE AS OF

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:09.419
JANUARY FIRST AND HAVE BEEN

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.054
DOING SOME EARLY ANALYSIS OF

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.322
WHAT. IS IN THOSE REPORTS AND

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.224
WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AND I WOULD

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.926
JUST SAY THAT- THUS FAR WE'VE

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:18.161
SEEN A MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING-

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.062
BEING TARGETED ON YOUTH

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:20.464
HOMELESSNESS AROUND EMERGENCY

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.099
SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.767
DAY CENTERS I THINK THAT'S NOT

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:24.868
A- SURPRISE GIVEN HOW THE

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:25.836
FUNDING WASN'T WAS SORT OF

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:27.904
INTENDED AND FRAMED- WE'VE

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.240
ALSO. HEARD CONSISTENTLY THAT

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:31.241
THERE AREN'T SAFE PLACES FOR

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:32.709
USED TO GO THAT ARE IN CRISIS

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:35.112
AND SO. A STRONG INVESTMENT IN.

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.079
OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT THAT

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.047
ISN'T IN IT ISN'T AS HUGE

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.282
SURPRISE AND IT'S SOMETHING WE

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:40.417
WERE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF- BUT

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.885
CLOSELY BEHIND THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:42.386
SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:43.520
INVESTMENTS IN RAPID RE

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.322
HOUSING. OUTREACH STRATEGIES

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:47.691
PREVENTION AND DIVERSION. AND A

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:48.158
LITTLE BIT BEHIND THAT

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:49.559
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. WE'VE

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:51.161
ALSO SEEN THE MINIMAL

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:53.030
PROGRAMMING. AROUND HOST HOMES-

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:54.264
WENT TO HER MENTION A LITTLE

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.065
BIT SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.433
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT REUNIFICATION

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.235
ACTIVITIES. SO THAT SORT OF AN

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.336
INITIAL SENSE OF WHERE WE'RE

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.337
SEEING SOME OF THE FUNDING FROM

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:03.173
KEEP GOING. BUT I THINK OVERALL

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.774
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.443
MOST. ISN'T ONLY I WOULD THINK

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.111

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.028
I THINK IT'S LET US IN THE

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.997

CHRONICALLY OF YOUNGSTERS THAT

REALLY NEED TO RECEIVE HELP AND

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:11.287
I'M TALKING ABOUT AGE GROUP

IT'S AROUND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:14.390
TO TWENTY FOUR. THOSE

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.692
YOUNGSTERS HAVE FAILED IN

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:17.093
SCHOOL MANY EMIGRATE AUSTER

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.796
JOBS HAVE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND.

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:21.965
THE WHOLE SLEW OF SERVICES SO

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:23.166
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.635
DOING FOR ADULTS OW HELPING

THAT THERE IS A SYSTEM OF CARE

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:38.047
AVAILABLE CASE MANAGEMENT IS.

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.883
ONE OF THE COSTLIEST TO HIDE

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:42.185
AND I SAY MY OPINION THAT'S

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:42.952
WITH REALLY INCREDIBLY

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.288
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:48.591
FACTUALLY- AND DO IT THROUGH A

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:49.325
SYSTEM OF CARE WHERE YOU CAN

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:51.060
INTEGRATE. THIS ONE'S RECORD

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:51.761
YOU CAN INTEGRATE THEIR

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:53.730
HEALTHCARE THE CLIENTS.

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:55.798

YOUNGSTERS FACING AND HOW WE

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:10.613
CAN HELP TRY TO RECTIFY THAT AT

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.048
THAT POINT IN SOME WAYS IT'S A

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.750
LITTLE LATE BUT I WOULD SAY WE

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:14.884
HAVEN'T DONE IT I DON'T KNOW

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.352
ANY SYSTEM THAT HAS REALLY BEEN

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:18.121
ABLE TO. TO TACKLE ALL THAT

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.555
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT NOW IN

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:21.291
OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT BUT

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:23.359
THAT'S JUST ONE DEPARTMENT WHAT

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:23.860
ABOUT OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.328
INTEGRATING THEM BEING ABLE TO

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:27.030
TALK TO. OUR JUSTICES ARE

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:28.998
JUSTICE INVOLVED DEPARTMENTS

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.400
AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO TRY TO

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:32.035
CREATE A- NEW ONE OF

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:34.304
INFORMATION THAT'S RELATIVE AND

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:36.039
THAT CAN BE UPDATED EASILY AND

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.774
ACCESSIBLE GIVEN GIVEN

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.809
CONFIDENTIALITY. BUT NONE THE

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:41.244
LESS IT HAS TO HAPPEN AND THAT

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.112
COSTS MONEY THE COUNTY LOS

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:46.282
ANGELES- I WILL TELL YOU DOUBT

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:49.285
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:55.925
PUT ALL THAT DATA. ANY A COP. A

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:57.193
MANNER. IN SOMETHING STAY. TO

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.595
OF. AND BE PUT ON THE TO THAT

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:00.363
BECAUSE WE TALK SETTING SYSTEM

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.464
OF CARE. EVERYWHERE BUT IF YOU

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.067
HAVE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.802
WHEN WE STOP THE REPEAT REPEAT

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:08.171
THE GOAL. MAY CONTINUE TO SPEND

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.640
A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT'S

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.741
WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE JUST

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:14.911
LEARNED IN THE LAST. REALLY

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:21.584
FIVE YEARS OF ON THE SUPERB. TO

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:25.288
SEE. ATTAR TOOLS FOR SOME

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.789
REASON IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.825
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIX.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:32.428
I THINK THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:36.065
UP SHELTERS PROVIDED- OFFER YOU

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:43.539
STIRS. I. THE LADY IN EAST LOS

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.742
ANGELES AND INCORPORATED AREA

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.210
THAT ACTUALLY HAD TRANSITIONAL

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:49.579
AGE. OF ASSISTED LIVING FOR

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.848
YOUNGSTERS AT IT WAS COSTLY.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.649
BUT IT WAS IT WAS VERY TIMELY.

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:55.651
AND IT WAS VERY NECESSARY SINCE

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:56.886
THAT TIME I CAN'T REALLY TELL

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.087

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.522
FACILITY HAS BEEN BUILT.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.958
BECAUSE IT COSTS MONEY CAPITAL

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.292
BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.261
ESTABLISH THE SYSTEMS OF CARE

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.362

WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND THEN

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.298
MAKING SURE. THAT THAT THOSE

JOB TRAINING AND COUNSELING

SKILLS. JOB TRAINING I THINK IS

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.076
REALLY ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.725
LET ALONE. BEING ABLE TO FIGURE

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.694
OT THAT ACCOUNT. OF WHO HAD

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:44.500

CARE THAT THEY NEED AND IT'S

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.545

CUFF BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MORE.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.030
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:16.666
GET A CANDID VIEW OF WHAT- ONE

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:17.500
INDIVIDUAL THAT REPRESENTS AND

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.268
I ONLY REPRESENT TWO MILLION

THE CHILDREN THAT WERE FAILING

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:34.150
RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT WE

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.651
HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE WE HAVE

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:38.721
TO INSIST. THAT OUR SCHOOLS

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.756

DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.083

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:10.019
THAT THEY- ARE TIMID. THEY ARE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.021

THE CASE MANAGEMENT ASPECT IS

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.507
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD WITH

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.176

WE NEED MORE CASE MANAGERS

THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:17.193
ABLE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE FOR THEM%

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:20.262
TO COME IN. AND KIND OF DO THAT

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:21.997
TREE OPTION IN. LIKE YOU SAID

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.866

HEALTH CONCERNS IN BE ABLE TO

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:36.812
LOOK AT THAT HOLISTICALLY. TO

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.047
SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.416
PERSON AND WHAT KIND OF

GET THEM BACK TO IN A VITAL

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:50.726
PART OF SOCIETY. AND I THINK

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:54.230
UNTIL WE FIGURE THAT ASPECT

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:57.266
OUT. ST OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS

EVERYBODY'S WORKING IN A

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.683
DIFFERENT SILO. AND WE HAVE TO

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.919
BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS TO

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.454
ENSURE THAT WHOLE LISTICLE

DECADES. BUT THE SILOS ARE

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.562
STILL THERE. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.231

DOWN TO A WOUND THAT OPEN FLOW

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:41.143
COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE ONCE WE

GET THESE INDIVIDUALS IN. A AND

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.014

THE CRACKS WE NEED TO STEP UP

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.632
OUR GAME. AND IT DOESN'T NEED

KNOW ALL ABOUT COUCHSURFING

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.735
BEEN THERE DONE THAT I'VE GOT

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:15.404
BODIES IN. IT OUT IT'S ONE OF

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.373
THOSE THINGS YOU FORGET ABOUT

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:17.973
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.644
IT. BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.746
KEYS. THAT I SEE ACROSS THE

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.681
BOARD REGARDLESS OF RURAL OR

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.350
URBAN. THE THERE ISN'T A DIVIDE

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.419
ON THIS IT'S THE SIMPLE FACT

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:33.689
IS. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. ON

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:37.192
THE POLICY SIDE TO ALLOW THAT

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.528
OPEN FLOW OF COMMUNICATION AND

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:40.963
WE NEED TO PUT IT IN OUR BUDGET

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.465
THIS YEAR TWO SURE THAT THAT

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:45.200
FIGHT IS GOING TO INCREASE CASE

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:48.871
MANAGEMENT ENSURE THOSE

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.006
WORKLOADS ARE SMALL. A I'M VERY

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.510
PROUD OF HOW YOU HAD THAT-

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.812
QUESTION FOR MY SENIOR ISSUE

01:11:56.879 --> 01:12:00.349
HERE. SO I'M ON THE EDGE CARE A

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:04.086
SUPERBOWL HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.989
YOU TALKING FROM YOUR POINT OF

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.191
VIEW YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE- IN MY

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.626
POLICY PARTY KIND OF CALLED IT

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.461
THE TRIAGE TREATMENT TRANSITION

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:15.064
THE THREE TV'S. BUT FROM THE

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:18.801
YOUTH PERSPECTIVE. WHERE DO YOU

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.603
SEE THE S. POINT OF BRINGING IN

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.539
THAT CASE MANAGER AND HOW SOON

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.140
I MEAN IS IT WHEN THEY GET

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.876
ARRESTED AND INSTEAD OF TAKING

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.011
THEM AND BOOKING THEM TAKING

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.079
THEM SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:30.946
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:31.914
FROM THE PROFESSIONALS IN AND

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.515
BACK HOME. BUT FROM YOUR

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:34.717
PERSPECTIVE IS DOES THAT MAKE

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.852
SENSE WELL I THINK LIKE YOU

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:37.653
SAID YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.954
THAT TO BE THE FIRST POINT OF

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:39.922
INTERVENTION AND I THINK

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.657
INHERENTLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.891
THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.693
THIS LIKE. A DIFFERENTIAL AND

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.129
IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT I A

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.831
CAN LIKE BUILT THAT CONFIDENCE

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.300
REPORT WITH THAT YOUNG PERSON

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:54.636
SPECIAL IF THEY'RE LIKES LET.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:58.807
I'M TO THEN EVEN. THE PATH OF

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.242
ON FOR PROP. TAKING AND SO.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.277
YEAH I. OF YOU KNOW I KNOW

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.245
YOU'RE INTO. THEIR WAKING THE-

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.213
AND OTHER PER. THAT RUN A

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.481
PREVENTION IN. AT A PROGRAM

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.516
BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL WE DO

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.083
TRY TO INTERVENE AS SOON AS

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.852
POSSIBLE I MEAN I THINK

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.320
SOMETIMES IT COMES DOWN TO

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:14.990
SUPPORT EDUCATION WHICH- AS-

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.658
THE RISERS LEAST TALKED ABOUT-

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.193
SO IDENTIFYING THAT YOUNG

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:18.827
PERSON. FOR THAT YOU KNOW EVEN

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.429
GETTING FAT AND LIKE I. I'LL

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.531
JUSTICE AT PENSION SO. YOU KNOW

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.199
CHILD WELFARE THINK NEEDS TO

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.568
RESPOND REALLY THOUGHT FULLY

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:27.369
TO. YOU FAMILIES EXPERIENCING

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.504
HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW IT WE

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:29.671
KNOW THAT IT'S NOT A REASON IN

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:32.241
OF ITSELF REPORT- AND WE DON'T

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.075
THINK THE CHILDREN TO BE

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.177
REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.378
WHEN IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.148
SAFETY BUT- I THINK KIND OF

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.916
STARTS BEFORE THAT IDEALLY- I

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.085
THINK THAT. YEAH HAVING LAW

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.386
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS RESPONDING

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:45.320
TO ALMOST AS OBVIOUS IT'S A

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.221
HUGE THING THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:49.057
RIGHT NOW BUT- I THINK ALSO

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:50.392
NEED TO BE A LOT MORE COMMUNITY

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.528
EDUCATION AROUND. NINE ONE IS

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.462
NOT THE RIGHT NUMBER WHEN YOU

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:55.130
SEE SOMEBODY WHO'S POOR YOU

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.398
KNOW WHAT HE MEANS LIKE. THAT

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:58.367
IS NOT BAD WHAT THE RESOURCES

01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:00.569
ARE FOR AND IT DEFINITELY MEANS

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.038
AT LATIMES. POLICE HAVE TO THAN

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.573
ACTIVE SOCIAL WORKERS WHICH IS

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.941
NOT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO.

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.745
YEAH I THINK THE WE CAN CUT. A

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:12.214
LOT OF OUR- YEAH G. INTO. THOSE

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.448
WRITTEN QUE MANAGER AWAY FROM

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.184
CA JUSTICE FOR. IT REALLY JUST

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.485
MUCH BETTER OUT IN ON THIS YEAH

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:19.154
THE SECOND PART OF THAT. ALSO

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.557
IS ONCE. A LOT OF THESE

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.125
INDIVIDUALS AND UP ON THE

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.828
STREETS YOU END UP WITH THE

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.096
DRUGS COMING INTO PLACE IN THE

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:29.298
QUEUE TIED IN THE HOLD OPIOID

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.000

THAT ARE COMING. IN FROM THE

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:38.707
CARTELS INTO OUR STATE. AND

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.409
FROM THE YOUTH PERSPECTIVE HOW

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:42.845
DO YOU SEE WHICH IS A HERE ALL

THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT

WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.827
THAT YOUNGSTER THAT PERSON.

THEY NEEDED A SUPPORT THAT THEY

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:45.233
DESERVE. BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:47.435
THEY HAVE- COME INTO A

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:48.836

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:14.922
WHEN I FIRST BECAME HOMELESS MY

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.156

BACKGROUND I FELT VULNERABLE.

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:44.718
THE YOUNGER WE USE ARE THE MORE

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.853
WE ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:48.589
VULNERABLE TO TOXIC SITUATIONS.

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.291

WORKING WITH HOMELESS YOUTH.

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:16.930

VETERANS I'M A VETERAN I

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:58.905
BEDS. I CAN ALREADY POINT TO-

01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.739

COULD GO FOR AN HOUR. ABOUT THE-

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:19.626
THAT WE'VE BEEN A TO MAKE THESE

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.862
GREAT PROGRESS WITH. EXCITING

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:25.665
TO SEE THOSE BACK GROWTH. TWO

01:48:25.732 --> 01:48:26.700
LAST THINGS THAT WE DID WANT TO

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:29.169
COMMENT ON- THE CONTINUUM OF

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:31.271
CARE IS A BODY AND YOU GUYS ALL

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.206
KNOW HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS. HI

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:35.008

01:48:35.075 --> 01:48:36.576
OUTSTANDING THING AYE AYE IT'S

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.144
BEEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OR

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:38.712
SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.080
DOING THIS BUT- THE CONTINUUM

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:42.449
OF CARE DECIDES WHAT THE

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:42.949
PRIORITIES. THAT LOCAL

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:43.884
COMMUNITY IS. AND THEN

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:46.052
CONTRACTS GOOD. PLEA FROM HUD

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.787
TO THE NONPROFIT. I THINK THAT

01:48:47.854 --> 01:48:49.556
SYSTEM HAS WORKED REALLY WELL

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:51.091
AND THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:52.492
USE IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:53.326
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.395
ASSEMBLY. THIS AN AIDE TO CUT

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:57.297
MAYBE MODEL THAT SAME PROCESS

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:59.499
BECAUSE THAT THIS HEAT FUNDING

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:00.467
AND WITH THE HELP FUNDING THE

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:01.935
MONEY GOES TO THE CONTINUUM OF

01:49:02.002 --> 01:49:03.970
CARE. AT LEAST OUR CONTINUUM OF

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:06.806
CARE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO. THERE

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:08.608
AND THEY'RE MAKING. BUT THAT'S

01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:09.976
NOT THEIR FORTE THAT THERE

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:11.278
REALLY STRUGGLING IN THAT AREA

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:12.479
SO SOMETHING I'D ASK YOU TO

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:14.281

COUNSELING. I THINK I THINK

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.422
HOUSING IS THE NUMBER ONE

02:04:56.488 --> 02:04:57.890
PRIORITY AND THE REASON I THINK

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:00.259
THAT IS BECAUSE WITH OUR YOUNG

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:01.760
PEOPLE NEED MENTAL HEALTH

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:03.395
COUNSELING THEY CAN'T GET THAT

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:04.430
IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SECURE

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:06.532
PLACE TO LIVE THE THEY CAN'T

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:08.167
FIND A JOB THEY CAN'T GO TO

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:09.835
SCHOOL THEY CAN'T DO ALL THOSE

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.136
OTHER THINGS IF THEY DON'T HAVE

02:05:11.203 --> 02:05:12.471
A PLACE TO LIVE. SO IT REALLY

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:15.341
IS BACK TO STARTING AT HOUSING.

02:05:15.407 --> 02:05:16.575
CAN WE TALK TO PARENTS OF FOR

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:21.347
THEM TO- NOT TO COME OUT UNTIL.

02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:23.415
THEY STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET.

02:05:23.482 --> 02:05:26.485
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. I KNOW

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:27.686
WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER MY

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.921
PARENTS WHEN EXCITED ABOUT ME

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:30.422
BEING THERE BECAUSE I WAS KIND

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:34.660
OF DIFFICULT. HOME SO I COMPLY

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:36.362
I HAVE SOME COMPASSION FOR THE

02:05:36.428 --> 02:05:37.129
PARENTS THESE KIDS ARE

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:39.865
DIFFICULT SOMETIMES ALSO THEN

02:05:39.932 --> 02:05:41.066
THERE'S THE LIKE WHAT'S GOING

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:43.168
TO TALKING ABOUT THERE WERE NO

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:45.104
PARENTS THERE FOR HER AND MANY

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.105
OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.206
WORK WHETHER IN THAT

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:48.707
CIRCUMSTANCE HUMAN NAY BECAUSE

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:50.776
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDS THING IF I

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:56.215
CAN- BECAUSE I WAS ADOPTED AT

02:05:56.282 --> 02:06:00.419
AGE FOUR AND- IT. I IS IDEALLY

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:02.821
WITH MY CASE MY PARENTS CHOSE

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:06.258
TO BE MY PARENT AND THEN BAILED.

02:06:06.325 --> 02:06:09.595
AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:11.563
IT'S THEN KIND OF LEFT TO THE

02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:13.432
SYSTEM TO KIND OF FIX THOSE

02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:15.234
ISSUES VERSUS HOLDING

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.435
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE YOUTH TO

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.737
TRYING NAVIGATE AND FIX WHAT

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:22.942
PROBLEM HAD GONE WRONG- AND FOR

02:06:23.008 --> 02:06:25.311
THE JOB SITUATION- FOR MY

02:06:25.377 --> 02:06:27.546
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THERE WAS

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:30.883
NO I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:32.117
YEAR I CAN REALLY HOLD A JOB

02:06:32.184 --> 02:06:34.019
AND I'M TWENTY TWO AND THERE

02:06:34.086 --> 02:06:35.321
ARE TIMES WHERE I STILL

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:38.290
STRUGGLE EMOTIONALLY MENTALLY I

02:06:38.357 --> 02:06:41.293
MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT I

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:43.595
WENT TO THE YEARS COUNT. TO GET

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:48.033

HAVE A JOB IN BEING SIX AT IT

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:51.704

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.605
EARLIER WE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF

02:06:53.672 --> 02:06:55.507

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.763
HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.064
IMPORTANT THINGS BECAUSE OF

SPEAKS TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:49.461

COMING UP AND COMING OUT. NEW

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:56.535

02:20:00.058 --> 02:20:02.026
FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH THAT

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:03.661
ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH IT AND

02:20:03.728 --> 02:20:06.097
THE LOCAL PROCESS HUD REQUIRES

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.565
TO DETERMINE WHO IS ELIGIBLE

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.833
FOR HOUSING KNOWN AS

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:11.503
COORDINATED ENTRY PRIORITIZES

02:20:11.569 --> 02:20:12.470
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS AND

02:20:12.537 --> 02:20:14.139
INDIVIDUALS. SIGNIFICANT

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:17.041
FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS IN FACT

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:19.010
HUD DID NOT EVEN REQUIRED

02:20:19.077 --> 02:20:21.913
CONTINUES OF CARE TO COUNT. THE

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.081
NUMBER OF UNDER THE HOME TO THE

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:24.783
ANY POINT IN TIME COUNT UNTIL

02:20:24.849 --> 02:20:28.653
THE FIFTEEN. NOW I'M NOT SO

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.754
THAT TO BE YOU KNOW DOWN ARE

02:20:29.821 --> 02:20:30.955
NOT CONTINUE OF CARE OR ON THE

02:20:31.022 --> 02:20:32.791
HOMES RISK SYSTEM. IN FACT I'M

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:35.126
A BIG FAN BUT WE DO NEED TO

02:20:35.193 --> 02:20:36.461
HAVE THE STATE REFORM THAT

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:38.429
SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:40.165
OF HOMELESS YOUTH. WE HAVE AN

02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:41.933
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO DO

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.369
THIS OUGHT TO LEVERAGE THE

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:45.603
EXISTING HOMELESS RESPONSE

02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:47.672
SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

02:20:47.739 --> 02:20:49.007
HOMELESS YOUTH. HUD HAS POURED

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:51.609
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:54.612
INTO CREATING THIS SYSTEM AND-

02:20:54.679 --> 02:20:57.549
SO RATHER THAN ABANDON IT AND

02:20:57.615 --> 02:20:58.316
TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH LETS

02:20:58.383 --> 02:20:59.751
YOU TO IT BUT LET'S MAKE SURE

02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:02.020
THAT HOMES. ARE PART OF IT IN A

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:03.822
WAY THAT THEY NEVER HAPPENED-

02:21:03.888 --> 02:21:07.325
BUT CAN BE SO ONE SUCH POLICY

02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:09.661
THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THIS. IS A

02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:10.962
YOUTH SET ASIDE IN STATE

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:12.430
FUNDING. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD

02:21:12.497 --> 02:21:13.565
ABOUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THIS

02:21:13.631 --> 02:21:15.133
APPROACH WAS USED FOR THE FIRST

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:16.968
TIME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:17.936
WITH THE CREATION OF THE

02:21:18.002 --> 02:21:19.437
HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.206
KNOWN AS HEAT. WHICH AS YOU'VE

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:23.641
HEARD REQUIRED 5% OF THE FIVE

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:24.742
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AWARDED

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:26.578
TO CONTINUOUS OF CARE AND LARGE

02:21:26.644 --> 02:21:27.779
CITIES TO BE SPENT ADDRESSING

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:29.781
YOUTH. BOB KEEP FUNDING HAS

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:32.517
BEEN AWARDED AND IN MAY IT LAST

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:34.485
YEAR AND THEN MORE RECENTLY

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:36.754
YESTERDAY. WE'VE OF- WRITTEN TO

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:38.656
REPORTS ON HOW HE FUNDING WAS

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:41.492
USED FOR- HOMELESS YOUTH. WE

02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:43.561
HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA OF. HOW

02:21:43.628 --> 02:21:46.164
THAT FUNDING- HAS BEEN USED.

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:47.799
AND WE FOUND THAT THE HOMELESS

02:21:47.866 --> 02:21:48.700
USE THAT ASIDE IS CHANGING

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:50.802
PRACTICE LOCALLY NUMBER OF

02:21:50.869 --> 02:21:52.537
WAYS. THE FIRST WAY IS THAT THE

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:54.372
HOME IT USED WITH YOU THAT

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:57.475
ASIDE HAS DIRECTED OVER FIFTY

02:21:57.542 --> 02:21:58.042
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS

02:21:58.109 --> 02:22:00.945
ADDRESSING HOMELESS YOUTH. YOU

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:02.313
HEARD ABOUT ONE X. IN SAM DO

02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.181
YOU KNOW COUNTY IN THE REPORT

02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:05.183
WE HAVE OVER FIFTEEN DIFFERENT

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:06.417
EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW IT'S BEING

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:08.519
USED. AND IT'S JUST IMPORTANT

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:09.687
TO NOTE THAT THIS IS THE

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:12.523
LARGEST STATE INVESTMENT IN

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.124
YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN HISTORY

02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:15.426
CALIFORNIA. UP BACK IN MAY IT

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:18.663
WAS ADJUSTED 10% NOW IT'S UP

02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.732
211% OF TOTAL HEAT FUNDING

02:22:20.798 --> 02:22:22.800
WOULD DOUBLE THE LEGAL MINIMUM

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:24.836
REQUIRED BY LAW. WE WERE

02:22:24.903 --> 02:22:26.471
CURIOUS ABOUT THIS FINDING AND

02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:27.972
WE ASK THE CONTINUANCE OF CARE

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:29.207
AND LARGE CITIES WHY THEY

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:30.708
INVESTED MORE THAN DOUBLE THE

02:22:30.775 --> 02:22:32.277
LEVEL REQUIRED BY STATE LAW ON

02:22:32.343 --> 02:22:34.012
YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. AND THEIR

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:35.914
RESPONSE WAS TWO FOLD. FIRST

02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:38.283
THE LOCAL NEED IS OVERWHELMING

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:39.951
AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE IS NO

02:22:40.018 --> 02:22:42.186
SECRET SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:44.222
HOMELESS YOUTH THE TOTAL STATE

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:46.257
INVESTMENT PERMANENT ALLOCATION

02:22:46.324 --> 02:22:48.092
FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. IS ONE

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:49.694
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:51.496
CONTINUES A CARE TOLD AS WE

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:53.097
USED IT BECAUSE THE NEED IS

02:22:53.164 --> 02:22:55.199
DESPERATE. AND SECOND THEY USED

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:57.001
IT BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:57.602
THEY ACTUALLY HAD A SOURCE OF

02:22:57.669 --> 02:22:59.604
FUNDING. SECOND THE HOME IF YOU

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:00.772
SET ASIDE IMPROVE THE

02:23:00.838 --> 02:23:02.373
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CONTINUUM

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.575
OF CARE AND YOU PROVIDERS. IN

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:06.077
THE PAST CONTINUES OF CARE DID

02:23:06.144 --> 02:23:07.345
NOT RECEIVE A SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:08.313
THAT COULD ADDRESS YOUTH

02:23:08.379 --> 02:23:09.847
HOMELESSNESS. SO ALL OF THE

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:11.282
FUNDING THAT COMES FROM HOT

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:13.751
THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. NONE

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:16.988
OF IT IS YOUTH FUNDING- AND

02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:19.624
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL A

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:20.758
PILOT PROGRAM THAT'S ONLY

02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:21.859
AVAILABLE IN THREE

02:23:21.926 --> 02:23:23.361
JURISDICTIONS BUT THE CORE

AND LIKEWISE THERE WAS REALLY

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.905
NO MOTIVATION FOR THE CONTINUUM

5% YOU SET ASIDE HOMELESS

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:42.747
PROVIDERS ARE NOW AT THE TABLE

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.082
AS WE'VE HEARD IN STATE BERNIE

02:23:44.148 --> 02:23:45.750

TO USE THE FUNDING TO MEET

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.130
LOCAL NEEDS. IN SOME

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.132
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED A SHELTER

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:03.001
AS YOU HEARD 79% OF HOMES

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:04.035
UNACCOMPANIED YOU THURMOND

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:05.937
SHELTERED MANY COMMUNITIES AND

USE IT FOR RAPID RE HOUSING OR

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:16.180
ANOTHER HOUSING STRATEGY. AND

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:18.616
AS WE KNOW A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:24:18.683 --> 02:24:19.717
APPROACH DOESN'T WORK FOR

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:21.519
HOMELESS ADULTS AND IT DOESN'T

02:24:21.586 --> 02:24:23.221

IT TO BE SPENT ON YOUTH

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:30.995
HOMELESSNESS COMMUNITIES WERE

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:32.563
ABLE TO INVEST IN THE HOUSING

TO START WITH AND THEN MY

02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:44.455
IMPRESSIONS OF WHERE WE MIGHT

02:27:44.522 --> 02:27:45.656
GO FURTHER WITH EXTENT OF

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:46.224
FOSTER CARE FOR FIVE SHE BUT

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:48.192
ALSO LESS FOR THE BROADER

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:51.963
POPULATION OF HOMES YOU. SO

02:27:52.029 --> 02:27:53.231
WE'VE BEEN SEVEN HAD TWENTY

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:54.899
YOUNG WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:55.800
THIRTEEN WHEN THERE ARE

02:27:55.866 --> 02:27:56.534
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THEY WERE

02:27:56.601 --> 02:27:57.535
ALL IN YOUR SYSTEM

02:27:57.602 --> 02:27:59.170
REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE FROM THE

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.938
WHOLE STATE RURAL URBAN CETERA.

02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:03.341
WE'VE INTERVIEWED THEM AT

02:28:03.407 --> 02:28:03.941
SEVENTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE

02:28:04.008 --> 02:28:05.109
JUST FINISHED AT TWENTY THREE

02:28:05.176 --> 02:28:07.011
WE FOLLOWED OVER 85% OF THEM

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:08.679
FROM BASELINE. ALMOST ALL OF

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:12.049
THE 95% AT SEVENTEEN. SO WHAT

02:28:12.116 --> 02:28:12.516
WE FOUND IN TERMS OF

02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:14.452
HOMELESSNESS- WE ALSO YOUNG

02:28:14.518 --> 02:28:16.020
PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:16.787
OF HOMELESSNESS AND

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:19.190
COUCHSURFING EVERY TIME WE TALK

02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:21.025
TO THEM SINCE THE BASELINE. 31%

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:22.727
OF THEM REPORT BEING HOMELESS

02:28:22.793 --> 02:28:23.928
SOME POINT BETWEEN SEVENTEEN

02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:26.197
AND TWENTY ONE. ANOTHER 18% CAP

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:27.465
SEARCH SO THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF

02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.166
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. HAS BEEN AT

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.468
LEAST ONE NIGHT HOMES OR COUCH

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:32.236
SURFING A DURING THAT FOUR YEAR

02:28:32.303 --> 02:28:34.472
PERIOD- ON AVERAGE THEY WERE

02:28:34.538 --> 02:28:35.773
HOMELESS FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.341
THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS. BUT

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:38.743
ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM HOMES FOR

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:39.710
LESS THAN A WEEK SO THAT

02:28:39.777 --> 02:28:41.279
AVERAGE BE KIND OF MISLEADING

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:43.214
YOU GOT FOLKS ARE HOMES FOR A

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.116
LONG TIME. A LOT OF THEM IT'S

02:28:45.182 --> 02:28:47.918
FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. WHAT

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:48.552
ARE SOME RISK FACTOR FOR HOME.

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:49.186
AMONG YOU FLEE TO FOSTER. AND

02:28:49.253 --> 02:28:50.521
THIS IS GONNA ALL START TO

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:51.522
SOUND VERY FAMILIAR HERE IN

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:52.523
TERMS OF WHAT FOLKS BEEN SAYING

02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:54.492
THUS FAR. I GUESS I WOULD START

02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:55.760
WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA THAT'S

02:28:55.826 --> 02:28:57.061
THE BIGGEST RISK FACTOR FOR

02:28:57.128 --> 02:28:58.629
HOMELESSNESS IN THIS POPULATION

02:28:58.696 --> 02:28:59.864
IT'S A RISK FACTOR FOR HOMELESS

02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:01.532
AND ANY. POPULATION OF YOUNG

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:04.135
ADULTS AND YOUTH- WE HAVE DATA

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:05.670
ON LOTS OF THINGS THAT THE

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:07.471
INCREASE THE RISK OF. OF YOUNG

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:08.572
PEOPLE BECOME HOME. PLACEMENT

02:29:08.639 --> 02:29:09.573
INSTABILITY WHILE THEY'RE IN

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.108

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:12.643
PROBLEMS A HISTORY OF RUNNING

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:14.312
AWAY WHILE THEY'RE IN CARE. THE

02:29:14.378 --> 02:29:15.346
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:16.847

INVOLVEMENT A FAMILY HISTORY OF

02:29:19.784 --> 02:29:21.886
HOMELESSNESS- MALES ARE ALSO

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:23.654
GREAT RISK AND SEXUAL MINORITY

02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:24.588
YOUTH ARE BETTER RESPITE. I

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:26.324
WOULD SAY TRAUMA JUST JUMPS OFF

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:27.725
THE PAGE IN TERMS OF THOSE

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.760
THINGS- AND IT'S CONSISTENT

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:31.929
WITH BRAIN SCIENCE. DURING THIS

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:33.264
PERIOD OF TIME. YOU HAVE A HARD

02:29:33.331 --> 02:29:35.766
TIME- AGING OR MOTIONS. AND

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:38.102
STRESSFUL SITUATION. YOU'LL

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.003
HAVE. YOU'RE GONNA GONNA MAKE

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:40.404
TO SAY. THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:44.675
AND- AN INFECTION PLUMMETED

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:45.242
EDUCATION AND HOUSING. CHECK

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.143
FACTORS TO THINGS JOHN ABOUT

02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:50.281
WHY. ADULT SUPPORT. MULTIPLE

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:52.717
ADULTS NOT. ON THE- YEAH YEAH I

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:54.352
WANT. TO LIVE. GOOD ACTUALLY

02:29:54.418 --> 02:29:55.353
THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE FOR

02:29:55.419 --> 02:29:58.756
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE 90% AND WILL

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:01.459
TELL YOU THAT. AN ADULT. I THEY

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:11.035
NEED MORE THAN. ALLOWING ON

02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:12.636
PEOPLE REMAINING CARE.

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:14.472
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE RISK

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:16.674
OF HOMELESSNESS AND- I WAS ON

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:17.708
THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE AND

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:19.310
HOMELESSNESS RESEARCH COUNCIL

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:20.077
FOR NUMBER YEARS EVERYBODY

02:30:20.144 --> 02:30:21.679
AROUND WOULD TELL YOU. IF YOU

02:30:21.746 --> 02:30:23.047
SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE'S HOUSING TO

02:30:23.114 --> 02:30:24.181
PROVIDE THEM HOUSING THEY WILL

02:30:24.248 --> 02:30:25.950
BE LESS LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS.

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:27.451
AND ESSENTIALLY THAT IF

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:28.619
EXTENDED CARE DOES NOTHING

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:30.654
ELSE. IT SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED

02:30:30.721 --> 02:30:32.089
TO PROVIDE THE SAN PEOPLE WITH

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:33.691
YOU KNOW THREE HOTS AND A COT

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:34.625
BASICALLY A PLACE TO LIVE IN

02:30:34.692 --> 02:30:35.960
THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND SO

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:38.129
CLEARLY DOES THAT IN MANY CASES

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:39.430
SO WHAT'S IN THAT AFFECTED THAT

02:30:39.497 --> 02:30:41.031
I JUST GAVE YOU THE BAD NEWS

02:30:41.098 --> 02:30:42.266
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF BECOME

02:30:42.333 --> 02:30:44.502
HOMELESS. BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:45.536
IS THAT EVERY ADDITIONAL YEAR.

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:47.605
MEDICARE SPENDING TIME CARE

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.006
REDUCE THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS

02:30:49.073 --> 02:30:51.442
BETWEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE BY

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:52.042
ABOUT ONE THIRD. THIS IS HALF

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:53.944
THE SHOP PEOPLE SEVENTEEN ARE

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:55.146
IN CARE OF THE TWENTY FIRST

02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:58.349
BIRTHDAY. I MEANS OF FOR THOSE

02:30:58.416 --> 02:30:59.049
OF YOUNG WILL YOU. RISK OF

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:01.519
ALMOST BY TWO THIRDS. BY BIKES

02:31:01.585 --> 02:31:05.322
THAT TOOK CARE. SECOND FOUND IS

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.890
THIS RELATES THAT OVER THE

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:07.324
SUPPORT. WE HAVE SHOWN PEOPLE

02:31:07.391 --> 02:31:07.992
YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE YOU CAN.

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:10.227
ON FOR TANGIBLE SUPPORT. SOME

02:31:10.294 --> 02:31:12.830
RELIABLE MONEY PLACE TO CRASH

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:13.964
GET YOU SOMEWHERE IF YOU NEED

02:31:14.031 --> 02:31:15.132
TO GET THERE. THOSE WHO SAID

02:31:15.199 --> 02:31:17.001
THEY HAD ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE 44%

02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:18.936
LESS LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS IN

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:21.172
THE YOUNG PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD

02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:23.941
NO ONE. WERE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE.

02:31:24.008 --> 02:31:24.442
SO WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT

02:31:24.508 --> 02:31:25.543
BOLSTERING THE SIX CENTER

02:31:25.609 --> 02:31:26.911
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OF THIS

02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:27.511
GOING TO SOUND REALLY FAMILIAR

02:31:27.578 --> 02:31:29.647
SO. THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY

02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:31.649
IS MAYBE A NEW THING AND THAT

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:33.384
IS YOU FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:34.885
HAVE WHAT I CALL WHEN I GO OUT

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.020
AND TALK WHEN THE COUNTRY ABOUT

02:31:36.086 --> 02:31:39.089
MY STUDY. THE MOST INCLUSIVE-

02:31:39.156 --> 02:31:40.057
PROGRAM THAT CENTER FOSTER CARE

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:41.392
IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:43.561
ESSENTIALLY A RIGHTS BENEFITS

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:46.030
PROGRAM- AND I THINK THAT MAKES

02:31:46.096 --> 02:31:47.498
SENSE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:49.333
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HELP.

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:50.768
IN ORDER IS BECAUSE I'M A

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:52.636
PARENT OF TWO YOUNG ADULT THE

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:54.772
DAUGHTERS AND- THEY RELY ON ME

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:56.640
FOR SPORT ALL TIME I GET TEXT

02:31:56.707 --> 02:31:57.641
EARLIER TODAY MY TWENTY THREE

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:58.142
YEAR OLD WITH A CONCRETE

02:31:58.209 --> 02:32:00.211
QUESTION BY EITHER. GET THROUGH

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:03.013
A PROBLEM. BUT YOU GOT A LOT OF

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.782
VARIATION BETWEEN YOUR COUNTIES

02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:05.583
IN TERMS OF HOW THAT'S BEING

02:32:05.649 --> 02:32:07.418
IMPLEMENTED. AND THE RATE AT

02:32:07.485 --> 02:32:09.320
WHICH ON PEOPLE REMAINING CARE

02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:09.920
TO TWENTY ONE VERY IS QUITE A

02:32:09.987 --> 02:32:11.021
BIT BETWEEN COUNTIES IN THE

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:12.089
STATE IN OUR DATA SUGGESTS

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:13.457
THAT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:14.558
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE YOUNG

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:15.726
PEOPLE IN THEIR INCLINATIONS

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:16.794
ARE THE HOUSE MARK EVERYTHING

02:32:16.861 --> 02:32:18.662
LIKE THAT. SINCE SOME COUNTIES

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.197
ARE BEING MORE INCLUSIVE AND

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:21.765
WELCOMING WITH THEIR EXTENDED

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:23.667
CARE POLICY THAN OTHERS- BY

02:32:23.734 --> 02:32:24.869
DIDN'T REALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.337
WHY THAT'S THE CASE ON WHAT WAY

02:32:26.403 --> 02:32:27.738
THAT WORKS BUT I THINK THAT'S

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:28.339
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD PAY

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:30.007
ATTENTION TO. THE OTHER THING I

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.108

NOT IN A POSITION TO ENGAGE AND

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:10.781

ALL THESE ADULTS SERVICE

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:16.720
SYSTEMS. YOUNG PEOPLE GO TO-

02:33:16.787 --> 02:33:18.589
CHANGE BE PROGRAMS. HOPEFULLY

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:19.957
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE DOING THAT.

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:21.025
BUT A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE

02:33:21.091 --> 02:33:22.960
INSULTS. AND THEY'RE NOT

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:23.527
GETTING THE LEVEL OF

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:24.662
INTERVENTION WE NEED TO

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:26.130
COMMONSENSE SUGGESTS THAT MODEL

02:33:26.196 --> 02:33:28.032
CASE MANAGEMENT. IS NOT

02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:29.733
ADEQUATE. EVIDENCE ALSO

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:30.868
SUGGESTS THAT I'VE BEEN

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:32.369
INVOLVED IN EVALUATING TO

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:33.938

02:33:34.004 --> 02:33:34.705
AND OTHERS CALL THE

REACH PROGRAM THOSE WERE

02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:38.909
INTENSIVE. CASE MANAGEMENT

02:33:38.976 --> 02:33:41.612

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:42.613
THOSE WORKERS AND TRAUMA

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.048
FOCUSED AB T. MOTIVATIONAL

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.449

BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK

02:33:46.784 --> 02:33:48.419
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THAT

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:49.420
PROGRAM SHOWED A REDUCTION

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:50.654
HOMELESSNESS BETTER MENTAL

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.923

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.592
BROKE OUT REACH PROGRAM AGAIN

02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:56.260
INTENSIVE LOWER CASE LETTERS

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:57.561
ANSWER QUESTION LOWER CASE

02:33:57.628 --> 02:34:01.332
LOADS OF THESE AROUND EIGHT TO

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:02.466
TEN. SICK INCREASE COLLAGEN.

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:04.735
PERSISTENCE SO I THINK WE NEED

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.370
TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEIR

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:07.371
STRUCTURAL ISSUES IN YOUR

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:08.505
TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM I THINK

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:09.506
RIGHT NOW THAT MAKE IT

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.475
DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES TO DO

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:12.076
THAT EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO DO

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:15.045
IT LASTLY. AT JUST A ON THIS

02:34:15.112 --> 02:34:17.815
POINT- IF I'M A CASE WORKER AND

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:18.882
I HAVE A YOUNG PERSON WHO NEEDS

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:20.551
MORE HELP THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:22.019
A MONTH THEY GET FOR SELF MIGHT

02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:23.454
GET THEM A PLACE TO STAY AND

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.289
THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE. BUT I

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:27.024
THINK THEY NEED MORE HELP ALL I

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:29.927
HAVE IS T. H. P. AND MD. I

02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:31.228
DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER TOOLS

02:34:31.295 --> 02:34:32.863
RIGHT. SO I THINK THINKING

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:35.599
ABOUT THAT STRUCTURAL ISSUE- IS

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.101
SOMETHING WORTH DOING FOR AND

02:34:37.167 --> 02:34:38.602
THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IS IN A

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:39.837
IN A POSITION TO THAT WERE AS

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.338
THE COUNTIES ARE NOT. AND THEN

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:42.640
LASTLY I THINK WE'VE HEARD A

02:34:42.706 --> 02:34:44.174
LOT OF THIS DEVELOPING BETTER

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:45.609
COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTY

02:34:45.676 --> 02:34:47.244
TROUBLE FOR AGENCIES AND ALL

02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:48.912
THESE ADULTS SERVING SYSTEMS.

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:50.848
TO WORK WITH THEIR SYSTEMS AS

02:34:50.914 --> 02:34:52.783
PART OF A SOLUTION AND IN AN

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:55.252
ATTEMPT TO GET DOT STRIP

02:34:55.319 --> 02:34:56.253
DISMISS TO BE SENSITIVE TO

EXPONENTIALLY MORE LIKELY TO BE

02:40:09.466 --> 02:40:11.001
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:12.135
I WAS GROWN UP WHO WAS RAISED

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:15.405
AROUND. AND IN ALL HONESTY- IN

02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:17.040
MY OWN HUMBLE OPINION BEING

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:19.676
HOMELESS SAVED ME. FROM A LOT

02:40:19.743 --> 02:40:21.511
OF THE FAMILY STUFF THAT I WAS

02:40:21.578 --> 02:40:23.180

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:24.881
BEING HOMELESS WAS HOMELESS WAS

02:40:24.948 --> 02:40:27.050
DIFFICULT I WAS ABLE TO FIND

SUPPORT THROUGH THAT PROCESS

02:40:28.485 --> 02:40:29.219
AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND

02:40:29.286 --> 02:40:31.922
RESOURCES. THROUGH AN AGENCY-

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:33.690

WHO IS A RECIPIENT OF THE

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:37.494
FUNDING THAT WE'RE HOPING TO

ENDING HOMELESSNESS. AND THAT'S

02:40:44.534 --> 02:40:46.670
REALLY OUR GOAL WE NEED TO TALK

02:40:46.737 --> 02:40:48.705
ABOUT SOME REAL SOLID OUTCOMES

02:40:48.772 --> 02:40:50.774
AND- TO GO TO YOUR POINT- IT

02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:52.242

02:40:54.077 --> 02:40:55.579
AS RAMPANT OF A PROBLEM AS IT

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:57.381

WHISPER. WHEN REALLY WE'RE

02:41:16.666 --> 02:41:18.602
LOOKING AT IS THE STATE. AS A

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:21.004
WHOLE HAS DECIDED FOR THIRTY

02:41:21.071 --> 02:41:22.205

MONEY TOWARDS OIL CHANGES AND

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:26.209
TUNE UPS. THE STATE IS DECIDED

ONTO IT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND

02:41:29.479 --> 02:41:31.048
THEN TRY TO THROW LUMP SUMS OF

02:41:31.114 --> 02:41:33.083
CASH AT BUYING A LOT OF NEW

02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:35.318
CARS THIRTY YEARS LATER. WHEN

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:36.353
IF WE WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN

02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.922
USING INCREMENTAL FUNDING TO

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:40.223
PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING SUCH A

02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:41.892
MASSIVE ISSUE. IT COULD HAVE

02:41:41.958 --> 02:41:44.661
BEEN AVOIDED. NOW THAT PRESENTS

02:41:44.728 --> 02:41:47.130
AS WITH THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:51.168
TO REALLY FRAME HOW WE WANT.

CAN BE. IN A TRUE WAY TO ENSURE.

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.757
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

02:42:13.824 --> 02:42:14.658

HOMELESS ADULT WE ALL

02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:20.263
UNDERSTAND THE SIDE EFFECTS AND

02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:21.398
THEN THE SYMPTOMS OF THAT OUR

02:42:21.465 --> 02:42:23.600
COMMUNITY. THEY ARE BAD FOR

02:42:23.667 --> 02:42:25.235
PROPERTY VALUES CRIME RATES GO

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:26.837
UP- THERE'S A LOT OF THE

02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:27.938
CLEANLINESS ISSUES THESE ARE

02:42:28.004 --> 02:42:29.339
ALL THINGS WERE WELL AWARE OF.

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.274
SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO SOLVE

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:32.976
THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING AT THE

02:42:33.043 --> 02:42:35.112
WEEDS OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS

THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT BUT THE

02:42:41.384 --> 02:42:43.687
REAL ROOT CAUSE OF IT THE REAL

02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:45.088
WAY TO GET THOSE WEEDS OUT OF

02:42:45.155 --> 02:42:46.623
THE GARDEN. IS TO FOCUS ON

02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:47.791
KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:49.092
BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE

02:42:49.159 --> 02:42:50.227
BEGINNING WHICH IS WHY I

02:42:50.293 --> 02:42:51.561
BELIEVE THIS FUNDING IS SO

02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:54.297

HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. BUT

02:43:08.879 --> 02:43:11.915
HOW NAIVE BECAUSE WE SPEND

02:43:11.982 --> 02:43:13.717
MONEY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM NOW

02:43:13.783 --> 02:43:15.252
EVEN THOSE CREATED THIRTY YEARS

02:43:15.318 --> 02:43:17.354
AGO AND WE'RE NOTLOOKING

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:18.989
THIRTY YEARS AHEAD THAT'S THE

02:43:19.055 --> 02:43:21.458
WAY GOVERNMENT WORKS. THAT'S

02:43:21.525 --> 02:43:23.293
YOUR FRUSTRATION AND I SHARE

MONEY IN THE PROGRAM THAT THAT

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:29.533
WERE. LOOKING AT NOW VERY

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:32.202
LITTLE OF THAT IS TO PREVENTION

02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:34.771

SO THESE KIDS ARE CARRYING

02:43:55.692 --> 02:43:57.994
THESE CHALLENGES ALL THE WAY

02:43:58.061 --> 02:43:59.162
THROUGH SO I APPRECIATE YOUR IT

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:01.698
ANALOGY ABOUT THE- CARD. ADDING

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:03.033
OIL INTO A WEEK BECAUSE WE

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:05.502
HAVEN'T IN AND WE TYPICALLY

02:44:05.569 --> 02:44:08.505
DON'T. WANT TO ADDRESS- WERE

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:09.873
HAVE BERRY SEE TO TALKING

02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:11.241
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT YOUTH WHEN

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:13.143
WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESS. BUT

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:14.244
PREVENTING YOUTH HOMELESSNESS

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:16.780
NOW YOUR RATE IS SAVING FUTURE

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:18.315
ADMINISTRATIONS IN FUTURE

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:19.983
LEGISLATURE'S THIS EXACT

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:21.918
CONVERSATION ABOUT DEALING WITH

02:44:21.985 --> 02:44:24.020
WHATEVER CRISIS THEY HAVE. DOWN

02:44:24.087 --> 02:44:26.356
THE LINE. AND PROFESSOR

02:44:26.423 --> 02:44:27.724
COURTNEY AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:29.726
A. B. TWELVE OF BERMAN TATIAN

02:44:29.793 --> 02:44:31.528
WHICH JUST STRIKES ME IS PRETTY

02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:32.529
CLEAR WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY

02:44:32.596 --> 02:44:35.298
FUNDED. ALL OF WHAT THAT

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:36.633
ULTIMATELY NEEDS TO BE. SO

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:38.668
AGAIN IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

02:44:38.735 --> 02:44:40.804
REDUCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE

02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:41.771
FUTURE AND SOME OF THESE

02:44:41.838 --> 02:44:43.773
CHALLENGES THAT THESE KIDS GO

02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:46.376
THROUGH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:46.443 --> 02:44:49.546
REALLY FUND THAT PROGRAM. NOW

02:44:49.613 --> 02:44:52.382
SO THAT KIDS WHO ARE AGING OUT

02:44:52.449 --> 02:44:54.050
OR I THINK ANYONE WHO WOULD

02:44:54.117 --> 02:44:55.852
TOUCH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM.

02:44:55.919 --> 02:44:57.254
AT SOME POINT IN THEIR YOUNG

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.455
LIFE BECAUSE THEY STILL COME

02:44:58.521 --> 02:44:59.623
WITH THOSE SAME DRAMAS AND THEY

02:44:59.689 --> 02:45:00.290
STILL COME WITH THE SAME

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:02.525
CHALLENGES NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS

02:45:02.592 --> 02:45:04.794
TO THESE PROGRAMS WHICH SHOULD

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:07.163
ALSO IN MY VIEW. GO UNTIL

02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:08.965
TWENTY FIVE NOT JUST TWENTY ONE

02:45:09.032 --> 02:45:10.667
WHICH IS MORE MONEY BUT WHAT

02:45:10.734 --> 02:45:11.501
HAD COULD INVESTMENT THAT WOULD

02:45:11.568 --> 02:45:15.071
BE. IN STRENGTHENING OUR KIDS

02:45:15.138 --> 02:45:18.241
SO WE TEND TO STEP TO THINK

02:45:18.308 --> 02:45:21.011
ABOUT HOMELESS YOUTH OR CHILD

02:45:21.077 --> 02:45:21.578
WELFARE INVOLVED YOU THROUGH

02:45:21.645 --> 02:45:23.947
OUR PROBATION YOUTH AS IF THERE

02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:24.848
AND WE TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY

02:45:24.914 --> 02:45:25.949
AS IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT KITS

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:28.285
BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY COME

02:45:28.351 --> 02:45:29.052
FROM THE SAME PROMISE THE SAME

02:45:29.119 --> 02:45:31.688
FAMILY ISSUES AND HOW DO WE

02:45:31.755 --> 02:45:34.424
SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR CHILD

02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:35.358
WITHOUT. ADDRESSING THE FAMILY.

02:45:35.425 --> 02:45:36.493
IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM BACK

02:45:36.559 --> 02:45:39.095
INTO THAT FAMILY IF WE'RE IF WE

02:45:39.162 --> 02:45:41.164
HAVE ANY NOTION OF IT. SO

02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:42.198
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING

02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:44.234
ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION TODAY

02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:46.369
IS I THINK IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS.

02:45:46.436 --> 02:45:48.438
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE

02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:50.640
ISSUES THAT THAT WE REALLY

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:53.410
HAVEN'T OPENLY ADDRESS. BUT

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:54.678
WHAT WOULD A BETTER SYSTEM LOOK

02:45:54.744 --> 02:45:56.179
LIKE A ME WHAT ARE THE THINGS

02:45:56.246 --> 02:45:56.846
WE NEED TO DO AND EVEN SOME OF

02:45:56.913 --> 02:45:58.548
THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE KIND OF

02:45:58.615 --> 02:46:00.283
PIECING SOME THINGS TOGETHER

02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:03.320
SHOULD WE HAVE AN AGENCY OR-

02:46:03.386 --> 02:46:07.090
THE ABILITY TO LOOK. AT KIDS.

02:46:07.157 --> 02:46:08.792
WHATEVER THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE.

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:11.127
AND PROVIDE SIMILAR LEVELS OF

02:46:11.194 --> 02:46:12.729
SERVICES ANY MISS DEATH OR YOU

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:14.297
TALK ABOUT SO HOMELESS YOUTH SO

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:15.832
IT IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

02:46:15.899 --> 02:46:17.167
DEAL WITH. HOW MUCH USE IN AND

02:46:17.233 --> 02:46:19.302
FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THERE ARE

02:46:19.369 --> 02:46:20.704
RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR SOME

02:46:20.770 --> 02:46:22.839
BUT NOT FOR OTHERS. AND YET

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:24.474
THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME.

02:46:24.541 --> 02:46:26.609
SITUATION SHOULD BE IN THE SAME

02:46:26.676 --> 02:46:29.045
PROGRAMS. WOULD WE BETTER BE

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.580
BETTER OFF HAVING A COMMON SET

02:46:30.647 --> 02:46:33.049
OF SERVICES. FOR KIDS

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:34.551
REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY ENTER

02:46:34.617 --> 02:46:36.853
THAT SYSTEM. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.888
THEM HOW THEY COME. AND NOT

02:46:38.955 --> 02:46:40.357
THINK OF THEM AS JUSTICE

02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:42.092
INVOLVED NOT THINK OF THEM AS

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:43.593
DEPENDENCY COULD NOT THINK OF

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:45.428
THEM AS HOMELESS. YOUTH THESE

02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:47.030
ARE ALL. KIDS WHO ARE

02:46:47.097 --> 02:46:49.332
STRUGGLING. AND WE HAVE AN

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:50.834
OBLIGATION TO HELP THEM IT

02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:52.168
ISN'T THAT ULTIMATELY THE STEP

02:46:52.235 --> 02:46:54.771
WE NEED TO BE TAKING. I THINK

02:46:54.838 --> 02:46:56.673
SO I THINK I THINK SO ACTUALLY

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:58.742
I HATE TO COVER THE LOOK THE

02:46:58.808 --> 02:47:00.310
LANGUAGE BUT WE I WAS ON

02:47:00.377 --> 02:47:01.511
NATIONAL ACADEMIES PANEL AROUND

02:47:01.578 --> 02:47:03.713
THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:04.681
YOUNG ADULTS AND THEN I WAS

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:05.415
KINDA. SERGEANTS AFTER THE

02:47:05.482 --> 02:47:07.217
SYSTEM INVOLVED. AND I GOT THE

02:47:07.283 --> 02:47:08.451
GROUP THEIR TALK WITH THE YOUNG

02:47:08.518 --> 02:47:10.086
PEOPLES' MARGINALIZED IT WASN'T

02:47:10.153 --> 02:47:12.222
LIKE RISK VULNERABLE IT'S LIKE

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:13.156
HEY THEY'VE BEEN MARGINALIZED

02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:15.859
LAST BRING THE MEN. AND I THINK

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:17.127
IF YOU DO THAT. YOU KNOW THE

02:47:17.193 --> 02:47:18.294
DETAILS OF THAT I THINK WILL

02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:20.997
PROBABLY BE ON THIS

02:47:21.064 --> 02:47:23.366
CONVERSATION BUT IF YOU IF YOU.

02:47:23.433 --> 02:47:23.900
YOU KNOW THINK IT THAT WAY

02:47:23.967 --> 02:47:24.834
ABOUT THEN. THESE JOSH I THINK

02:47:24.901 --> 02:47:27.036
OR ENCOURAGE IF NOT FORCED TO.

02:47:27.103 --> 02:47:28.471
WORK TOGETHER BETTER THAN THEY

02:47:28.538 --> 02:47:29.873
DO RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:30.740
OF GATE KEEPING HERE THAT GOES

02:47:30.807 --> 02:47:32.409
ON WHEN YOU HAVE. ELIGIBILITY

02:47:32.475 --> 02:47:34.210
CRITERIA AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING

02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:35.879
WITH NO RESOURCES IT'S JUST

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.280
RATIONAL BEHAVIOR FOR PEOPLE

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:38.415
SAY WELL THAT'S NOT OUR PRO

02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:40.550
THAT'S NOT. HE'S NOT ONE OF US

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:42.452
IN OUR SHE'S NOT ONE OF US. SO

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:43.686
I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY TO GO

02:47:43.753 --> 02:47:45.088
IN THAT DIRECTION IS ABSOLUTELY

02:47:45.155 --> 02:47:46.589
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND THEN

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:48.591
YOU FIGURE OUT. HOW TO USE YOUR

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:50.360
YOUR YOUR PROBATION SISTER

02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:51.528
TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM THE RUNAWAY

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:53.463
HOMELESS YOUTH ACT MONEY YOUR

02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:55.265
FAMILY ASSISTANCE RESOURCES. I

02:47:55.331 --> 02:47:56.933
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.868
IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S

02:47:58.935 --> 02:48:01.171
NO ARE FROM IT. BUT WOULD THAT

02:48:01.237 --> 02:48:02.639
BE MORE EFFICIENT. WELL I

02:48:02.705 --> 02:48:04.641
TESTED TALK TO HIS POINT AS SO

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:06.943
WITH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUTH

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.477
VOICE IN AND PRACTICES TO

02:48:07.544 --> 02:48:10.413
IMPROVE THIS GOING FORWARD. I

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:11.381
AM THE CHAIR OF OUR YOUTH

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:14.117
ADVISORY BOARD DOWN THEM AND

02:48:14.184 --> 02:48:16.352
YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND THEIR

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:17.954
MEMBERS OF MY YOUTH ADVISORY

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:19.489
BOARD TO EVER BE HOMELESS.

02:48:19.556 --> 02:48:21.758
REMEMBER WE HOPE. THERE ARE

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:25.929
PEOPLE. GO TO CALL. IN THEIR-

02:48:25.995 --> 02:48:26.563
WORK ON JOB SITES CONSTRUCTION

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:27.197
SO. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:48:27.263 --> 02:48:27.864
ABOUT ONE SET OF REESE. FOR ALL

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:28.932
YOU WHETHER THEY BE SYSTEM

02:48:28.998 --> 02:48:29.966
INVOLVED A REGARD I UNDER. THE

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.468
BEHIND THAT BECAUSE- LOOK I'M

02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:32.101
NOT GONNA TELL SOMEBODY THEY

02:48:32.168 --> 02:48:33.736
CAN'T HAVE A GOOD IDEA ABOUT

02:48:33.803 --> 02:48:35.071
YOU HOMELESSNESS JUST BECAUSE

02:48:35.138 --> 02:48:36.940
THEY WERE HOMELESS THAT WOULD

02:48:37.006 --> 02:48:37.574
BE NOT THAT WOULD BE. NAIVE OF

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:40.543
ME. BUT I THINK THAT- AS FAR AS

02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:41.744
MOVING THIS FORWARD WAYS TO

02:48:41.811 --> 02:48:43.146
IMPROVE IT I THINK HAVING YOUTH

02:48:43.213 --> 02:48:45.582
VOICE IN GENERAL IS ESSENTIAL.

02:48:45.648 --> 02:48:46.216
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A PIECE

02:48:46.282 --> 02:48:48.218
THAT IS OFTEN- WHETHER IT BE

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:50.019
UTILIZED I THINK IT'S UNDER

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.421
UTILIZED THERE ARE A LOT. AND I

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:52.622
WON'T NAME NAMES BUT THERE ARE

02:48:52.689 --> 02:48:54.624
A LOT OF NON PROFITS AND A LOT

02:48:54.691 --> 02:48:55.925
OF. AGENCIES IN GENERAL THAT

02:48:55.992 --> 02:48:58.127
HAVE A YOUTH VOICE AND IT'S ONE

02:48:58.194 --> 02:48:59.796
YOUTH PERSON. WHO NEVER REALLY

02:48:59.863 --> 02:49:00.997
GETS ANY SUPPORT FROM THAT H.

02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:02.398
T. BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE A

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:03.533
YOUTH VOICE AND THAT IS COMMON

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.768
PRACTICE. AND I THINK INTEL WE

02:49:05.835 --> 02:49:07.704
START- CHANGING SOME SOME

02:49:07.770 --> 02:49:09.305
GUIDELINES AND SOME DIALOGUE

02:49:09.372 --> 02:49:11.374
ABOUT WHAT IT YOUTH VOICE. AND

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:12.675
WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING WE

02:49:12.742 --> 02:49:13.476
REALLY SHOULD DISCUSS WHAT

02:49:13.543 --> 02:49:14.811
WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE- IF

02:49:14.878 --> 02:49:16.513
AND HOPELESSNESS IS OUR GOAL

02:49:16.579 --> 02:49:19.249
WILL BE HERE UNTIL I DIE. AND

02:49:19.315 --> 02:49:20.416
THE LONG TIME AWAY SO I THINK

02:49:20.483 --> 02:49:22.418
WE NEED TO START DOING IS

02:49:22.485 --> 02:49:25.488
ALLEGING THAT THESE. WHILE IT

02:49:25.555 --> 02:49:28.091
IS AN OVER ARCHING ISSUE

02:49:28.157 --> 02:49:30.426
THERE'S A LOT OF. MISSIONS

02:49:30.493 --> 02:49:36.299
UMBRELLA OF BUSINESS. YOU WANT

02:49:36.366 --> 02:49:38.067
TO OUR TARGET. THAT'S REALLY

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:38.668
AFFECT A VILLA AT THE END THE

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.003
ROAD. MORE THAN IF YOU DAM IT

02:49:40.069 --> 02:49:41.304
UP THREE VILLAGES AHEAD OF

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.039
THAT. YOU NEVER HAVE THE FLOOD

02:49:43.106 --> 02:49:44.173
DOWN THERE SO I THINK THAT'S

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.441
WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD THAT'S

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:47.510
THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS IS. YOU

02:49:47.577 --> 02:49:48.945
YOU HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL IS

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:50.647
AN ISSUE BUT- IF YOU REALLY IF

02:49:50.713 --> 02:49:52.348
WE REALLY AGREE AND WE'RE

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:53.483
HONEST THAT WE WANNA FIGHT

02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:54.617
AGAINST. HOMELESSNESS

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:56.019
CONTINUING TO GROW BECAUSE IT

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:58.321
IS GROWING. AND LIKE THE 3%

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:00.023
DECREASE. OF HOMELESS YOUTH

02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:01.791
THIS IS A NUMBER THAT I HEAR A

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.626
LOT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:05.128
GUYS KNOW THIS OR NOT. BUT THE

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:07.163
PEOPLE PUT MINISTER THAT COUNT

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:08.665
IN A LOT OF AREAS HAVE HEAVY.

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:10.900
IT HAS EVERY INCENTIVE. KEEP

02:50:10.967 --> 02:50:13.036
THAT NUMBER LOW. ESPECIALLY IF

02:50:13.102 --> 02:50:13.770
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR

02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:15.071
CONSTITUENTS TO THINK THAT YOU

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:16.239
OF ABOUT HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE

02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:16.973
RUNNING AROUND YOUR

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:18.741
NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I WOULD BE

02:50:18.808 --> 02:50:21.544
COST ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS NO THE

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:30.887
BEST. WE PUT ON END THAT A LET.

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:32.488
BECAUSE I'M OF A MUCH LARGER

02:50:32.555 --> 02:50:34.457
AMALGAMATION OF AN ISSUE. THAT

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:35.925
WE WILL NEVER GET A TRUE NUMBER

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:38.227
ON. IT AND I AM SORRY IF WERE.

02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:39.362
PATTING OURSELVES ON THE BACK

02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:42.231
FOR A 3% REDUCTION IN HOMELESS.

02:50:42.298 --> 02:50:44.601
WHEATLEY MISSING. THE POINT

02:50:44.667 --> 02:50:46.970
YES. AND THERE IS A PROPOSAL

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:49.072
FOR A YOUTH COUNCIL. WHICH I

02:50:49.138 --> 02:50:50.473
THINK WOULD BE FABULOUS YES I-

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.075
THREE OF US IT'S A YEAH AND

02:50:52.141 --> 02:50:53.843
THIS IS TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.812
GETTING KIDS VOICES WHEN WE-

02:50:55.878 --> 02:50:57.680
LOOKED AT IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY

02:50:57.747 --> 02:50:59.616
TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME

02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:00.183
CHALLENGES WE ARE HAPPY. TO

02:51:00.249 --> 02:51:02.318
OFFER. THEM WE DO THE SAME

02:51:02.385 --> 02:51:04.153
THING WHICH- SOME FOR FOSTER.

02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:07.824
WITH AND IT WAS. CLEAR AND-

02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:08.558
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE

02:51:08.625 --> 02:51:09.125
IN THE SAME LEVEL THEY THEY

02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:10.760
WERE INTIMATE IF. THEY WEREN'T

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:11.961
SURE HOW THEY FELT THERE IT'S

02:51:12.028 --> 02:51:12.962
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THEIR

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:15.632
VOICE. WE LET THEM CREATE THE

02:51:15.698 --> 02:51:17.634
VENUE WE LET THEM AND THEN WE

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.102
HAD TREMENDOUS ABOUT OF.

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:21.504
APPROPRIATE INPUT. INTO

02:51:21.571 --> 02:51:23.306
DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:25.541
SO IT'S LESS ABOUT ADULTS BEING

02:51:25.608 --> 02:51:26.676
VERY PATERNAL TELLING WE KNOW

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.344
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. WHEN WE

02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:30.046
DON'T IT'S LEADING. THE YOU

02:51:30.113 --> 02:51:32.515
HAVE A VOICE. IN THAT AND I

02:51:32.582 --> 02:51:34.117
THINK THE YOUTH THE YOUTH THAT

02:51:34.183 --> 02:51:35.418
I'VE DEALT WITH WHETHER.

02:51:35.485 --> 02:51:36.986
HOMELESS OR JUSTICE INVOLVED OR

02:51:37.053 --> 02:51:38.054
CHILD WELFARE INVOLVES OR ANY

02:51:38.121 --> 02:51:39.522
OF THAT. THEY DON'T LOOK AT

02:51:39.589 --> 02:51:41.190
EACH OTHER IN THOSE CATEGORIES

02:51:41.257 --> 02:51:43.059
WE CREATE THOSE CATEGORIES AND

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:45.128
I THINK WE MISSED THE POINT. BY

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:46.896
DOING THAT AND WE MISSED

02:51:46.963 --> 02:51:48.631
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY SERVE.

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:51.100
YOUTH IN A IN A COMPREHENSIVE

02:51:51.167 --> 02:51:53.036
WAY SO I'M HOPING WE CAN. DO

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:56.072
SOME KIND OF A SEA CHANGE. WHAT

02:51:56.139 --> 02:51:57.640
THE ONE PET PHRASE I'VE HEARD

02:51:57.707 --> 02:51:59.709
HOUSTON IT RESONATES WITH ME IS

02:51:59.776 --> 02:52:01.911
THE HIGH STAKES ELIGIBILITY. SO

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:04.380
LIKE IN FOSTER CARE IF YOU ARE

02:52:04.447 --> 02:52:07.350
REUNITED YOU KNOW BEFORE AGE

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:08.885
SIXTEEN OR IF YOU ARE EXITS

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:10.987
PERMANENCE BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN

02:52:11.054 --> 02:52:13.289
OR IF YOU ARE UNIFIED BEFORE

02:52:13.356 --> 02:52:14.557
EACH THIRTEEN THERE'S THESE

02:52:14.624 --> 02:52:17.160
MOMENTS THAT PUT YOU DIFFERENT

02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:19.996
CATEGORIES- BUT TO YOUR POINT

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:21.798
TO THEY HAVE. THE TUBE TO

02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:23.666
CHANGE TO GET RID OF TYSON

02:52:23.733 --> 02:52:25.935
SOLDIER BUT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW-

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:28.237
THAT ELIGIBILITY IS WHAT DRIVES

02:52:28.304 --> 02:52:29.539
ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES

02:52:29.605 --> 02:52:32.341
VERSUS RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO

02:52:32.408 --> 02:52:33.776
SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND MINIMIZE

02:52:33.843 --> 02:52:35.812
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOUNG

02:52:35.878 --> 02:52:38.181
PERSON. STE VERSES AND I KNOW

02:52:38.247 --> 02:52:43.319
FOR PRACTICE. IN THAT'S HI BUT

02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:44.487
IT'S GOTTEN TO AN EXTENT NOW WE

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:46.189
WORK LAST YEAR ON A BILL FOR

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:47.256
YOU TO TEACH PEOPLE US A

02:52:47.323 --> 02:52:48.124
HOUSING PROGRAM FOR FORMER

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:49.926
FOSTER IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE IF

02:52:49.992 --> 02:52:51.527
YOU'RE IN CARE ON YOUR

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:53.162
EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY WE TRIED TO

02:52:53.229 --> 02:52:54.864
GET DOWN BEST TO SIT TEAM TO

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:56.165
SAY YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE IN

02:52:56.232 --> 02:52:57.934

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.302
HAVE A LOT OF RISK THERE'S NO

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:01.571
REASON WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.039
TO ACCESS THIS PROGRAM. AND IT

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:04.574
WAS JUST. IT WAS. IT WAS NOT

02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:05.775
POSSIBLE LET'S JUST THAT

02:53:05.842 --> 02:53:07.577
BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE WERE.

02:53:07.643 --> 02:53:08.911
CRACKING OPEN THE DOOR AND TRY

02:53:08.978 --> 02:53:11.514
TO PUSH PEOPLE THROUGH- AND SO

02:53:11.581 --> 02:53:13.249
I JUST WANT A WHOLE HEARTEDLY

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:15.418
ENDORSED THE- MOVING AWAY FROM

02:53:15.485 --> 02:53:16.152
THIS VERY HIGH STAKES

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:18.454
ELIGIBILITY ORIENTATION. WE ARE

02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:20.757
VERY FAR AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE

02:53:20.823 --> 02:53:21.991
ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A WAY OF

02:53:22.058 --> 02:53:24.894
RATIONING. OF SCARCE RESOURCES

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:27.864
IT IT. YEAH BUT TO MISTER DEATH

02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:29.031
RIDGES POINT EARLIER LOOK AT

02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:30.933
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT IN

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:32.235
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHAT WE'RE

02:53:32.301 --> 02:53:34.504
TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR WE PUT IN

02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:35.104
LAST YEAR BUDGET. FOR

02:53:35.171 --> 02:53:37.340
HOMELESSNESS YEAH. WE COULD BE

02:53:37.406 --> 02:53:40.576
INVESTING THAT NOW IN YOUTH

02:53:40.643 --> 02:53:41.577
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:53:41.644 --> 02:53:44.514
ABOUT IS A SMALL PART OF ALL OF

02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:45.982
THIS GRAND OTHERWISE INVESTMENT

02:53:46.048 --> 02:53:48.618
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE SCHEME

02:53:48.684 --> 02:53:51.621
OF THINGS BUT IT'S SOMETHING

02:53:51.687 --> 02:53:52.155
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK

02:53:52.221 --> 02:53:54.490
ABOUT ITS ONGOING MONEY. HOW

02:53:54.557 --> 02:53:56.626
BETTER COULD WE INVEST IN OUR

02:53:56.692 --> 02:53:58.594
FUTURE SYSTEMS IN EVEN IN OUR

02:53:58.661 --> 02:54:01.063
CURRENT SYSTEMS. BEEN BEEN

02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:03.866
DEALING WITH THE SITUATIONS CAN

02:54:03.933 --> 02:54:06.335
FIND THEMSELVES IN AND HELPING

02:54:06.402 --> 02:54:07.136
THEM OUT THERE SO THEY DON'T

02:54:07.203 --> 02:54:08.638
BECOME PERMANENTLY HOMELESS OF

02:54:08.704 --> 02:54:11.307
THE DON'T BECOME. SO THAT THEY

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:13.509
CAN ACTUALLY BE PARTICIPATE IN

02:54:13.576 --> 02:54:14.477
OUR SYSTEMS RATHER THAN BE

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:16.579
SHUNTED ASIDE AS THEY- AS THEY

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.881
OFTEN ARE SO I DON'T. BY THAT I

02:54:18.948 --> 02:54:22.118
THINK THAT'S- FOOLISH AND WE

02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:22.685
END UP AND THROWING A LOT OF

02:54:22.752 --> 02:54:24.954
GOOD MONEY. CHASING SOLUTION OR

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.355
DIFFICULT JUST TO GO THROUGH

02:54:26.422 --> 02:54:29.058
THE MOTIONS WHEN WE HAVE I

02:54:29.125 --> 02:54:29.692
THINK HONESTLY A WAY OF DEALING

02:54:29.759 --> 02:54:33.262
WITH. WITH YOUTH NOW IN A MUCH

02:54:33.329 --> 02:54:34.430
MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY AND THAT'S

02:54:34.497 --> 02:54:35.765
AND INVESTMENT WE COULD BE

02:54:35.832 --> 02:54:37.400
MAKING A LONG TERM IN OUR

02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:39.468
COMMUNITIES AND REDUCE ME THINK

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:40.436
ABOUT REDUCING THE JUSTICE

02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:41.771
COSTS AND REDUCING THE TAP

02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:43.039
WATER GLASS AND PUTTING THOSE

02:54:43.105 --> 02:54:44.674
SYSTEMS OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH

02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:46.776
WE WON'T FOR LOTS OF REASONS

02:54:46.843 --> 02:54:48.811
BUT SEVERELY MINIMIZING WE

02:54:48.878 --> 02:54:51.681
MINIMIZE THE LONG TERM

02:54:51.747 --> 02:54:53.716
OBLIGATIONS OF THE SYSTEMS BY

02:54:53.783 --> 02:54:55.051
THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS BUT

02:54:55.117 --> 02:54:57.286
WE GET THERE WILL BY UPS

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:59.355
BIGELOW THESE WERE THAT. WE

02:54:59.422 --> 02:55:02.892
DON'T THAT WAY YOU THROW A LOT

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.793
OF MONEY PROBLEM THAT'S FOR US

02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:05.361
BECAUSE IT'S POLITICALLY X. BUT

02:55:05.428 --> 02:55:06.529
UNWILLING TO LOOK AT THE

02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:08.197
UNDERLYING CAUSES WERE LOOK TEN

02:55:08.264 --> 02:55:09.599
YEARS DOWN THE LINE TO SAY
