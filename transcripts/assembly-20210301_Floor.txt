A RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE FIRST MONDAY OF MARCH AS COLD NINETEEN MEMORIAL DAY. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST DAY AT HOME ORDERS WENT INTO PLACE. AND THE WORLD AS WE KNEW IT DRASTICALLY CHANGED. FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED FOREVER. IN ONE YEAR MORE THAN HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO COVE IN NINETEEN. MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF US SOLDIERS LOST IN WORLD WAR ONE AND WORLD WAR TWO COMBINE. AND WE HAVE LOST NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND LIVES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. INCLUDING MY OWN FATHER IN LAW. EACH LIFE LOST IN THIS PANDEMIC. LEAVES A HOLE IN THE HEART OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND. THE FIRST STEP TO HEALING IS RECOGNIZING THIS ENORMOUS LOSS IN THE WAY THAT CENTERS THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED. A KNOWLEDGE IS THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND IS COMMENSRATE TO THE SCALE OF THE PART OF THE PROBLEM. A PUBLIC MEMORIAL DAY CREATES A SPACE FOR US TO REMEMBER AND GRIEVE AS A COMMUNITY. IT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT AND LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE TO INSURE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO COMBAT FUTURE PANDEMICS. THIS RESOLUTION IS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS RECOGNITION OF THE COLLECTIVE LOSS EXPERIENCE DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC IN THE LONG TERM IMPACT IT WILL HAVE. ON CALIFORNIA AND OUR NATION'S. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS DIVE CALIFORNIA JOINT STATES AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY MAKING TODAY THE FIRST MONDAY OF MARCH COLD AT NINETEEN MEMORIAL DAY. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA.

THE CAUSE OF DEATH CLAIMS THE LIVES OF ANNEX APPROXIMATELY ONE IN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE CLAIMED NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN MOST OFTEN A SEEMINGLY HEALTHY CHILD GOES TO pWITH THE MIRACLES OF MODERN MEDICINE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH. IN A IN A IN CHILDHOOD. HOW TO PREDICTED OR HOW TO PREVENT IT. BECAUSE MANY DEVELOPING NATIONS LACK AWAY TO RECORD AND INVESTIGATE SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DOES DOES HAVE A METHOD TO TELL HOW WIDESPREAD. THE PROBLEM MAY BE AROUND THE GLOBE CORRECTION THEY ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A METHOD. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND WORK TOWARD THE DAY WHEN NO ONE SUFFERS THE LOSS OF A CHILD IN SUCH AN UNEXPECTED AND TERRIBLE WAY. FUNDS FOR RESEARCHWILL FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS CAUSE OF DEATH AND ALLOW US TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO MEDICAL EXAMINERS PEDIATRICIANS AND CORNERS TO ENSURE THAT WE ACCURATELY TRACKED. AND HAVE DATA FOR EVERY CASE OF SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD NO MATTER WHERE IT HAPPENS. TOMORROW WE WILL KNOW MORE THAN WHAT WE DO TODAY BUT TODAY IS AN IMPERATIVE THAT EVERY FAMILY THAT SUFFERS FROM THIS TRAGIC LOSS THAT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A NETWORK OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH REASSURANCE TO HELP THEM IN THEIR TIME OF BEREAVEMENT AND THROUGH THIS GRIEVING PROCESS. THERE IS THE SCRIPTURE ABOUT FINDING HOPE IN A KIND OF MORNING THAT READS I THINK OF YOU YOU ARE MY HELP I SING IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS. EVERY SOUL LOST TO SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD IS AN ANGELCALLING US. CALLING UPON US TO LIFT AND RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE THAT AFFECTS FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES.
