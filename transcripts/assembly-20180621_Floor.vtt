01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.699
MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:39.967

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.242
AND WHILE WE CELEBRATE THE

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:50.811
WONDERS OF IMMIGRATION AND WE

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:53.280

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.316
I HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH ONLY

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:58.285
ONE CONCEPT.

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:00.687
THE ENSLAVED WERE NOT IMMIGRANTS.

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:02.222
IT THE CONCEPT OF IMMIGRATION

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:05.292
IMPLIES THERE'S A DESIRE TO COME.

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:05.859
THAT YOU'RE SEEKING A BETTER

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:11.231
WILL WELCOME YOU IN.

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:11.832

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.405

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:20.307

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:22.109
THAT HELPED TO BUILD THIS NATION.

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:23.811
SPENT A LOT OF THEIR TIME IN

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:25.112
BLOOD AND ENERGY WORKING ON

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:27.481
BEHALF OF CREATING AN AMERICA.

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:29.149
THAT WERE NOT IMMIGRANTS AND THE

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.451
IN SLAVE SHOULD NEVER BE

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.653
CLASSIFIED WITH THE IMMIGRANTS

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:34.087
NOT THAT THAT'S A SHAME TO IT

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.456
BUT IT'S A SHAME TO US THAT WE

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:37.057

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.692
HOW WE GOT HERE THE STRUGGLE

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:39.793
THAT WE'VE HAD AND OUR

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.362

GALLAGHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.792
IN --

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:12.759
EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT NO THIS WAS

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:14.561
THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FROM

IRELAND HERE WITH A SCAPIN.

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:16.263
A PLACE WHERE HE FACED

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.799
OPPRESSION --

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:20.167
HIS SON ANTHONY WAS THE FIRST TO

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:21.935
BE BORN.

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:23.470
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES --

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:27.574

RHETORIC.

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:35.249
BECAUSE MY ANCESTORS FACE NEED A

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:38.552
LAWS NO IRISH NEED APPLY --

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.988
MY ANCESTORS WERE OFTEN PUSHED

01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:43.624
