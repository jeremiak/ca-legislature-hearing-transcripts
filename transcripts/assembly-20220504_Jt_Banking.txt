THANK YOU CHAIR RAMON GOOD MORNING I DO WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR FIRST OVERSIGHT HEARING RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR RAMON AND HER STAFF FOR HELPING ORGANIZE TODAY'S HEARING WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NO EASY TASK IN TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR RAMON TO PROVIDE OUR STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR WAS SIGNIFICANT NEW OVERSIGHT. AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE NEW AUTHORITY THE FBI MAY NOW TAKE ACTION WHEN A CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY SUCH AS A DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDER A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR A EARNED. EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROVIDER ENGAGES IN UNLAWFUL UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES THIS AUTHORITIES BROAD IT IS EXPENSIVE AND IT IS FORWARD LOOKING THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WORLD OF FINANCIAL SERVICES EVOLVES QUICKLY. NEW PRODUCTS EMERGE ALL THE TIME AND WE NOW HAVE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO RESPOND ON BEHALF TO CONSUMERS TO EMERGING TRENDS I BELIEVE THAT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION IN THE BANKING AND FINANCE AREA. IN RECENT HISTORY AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THIS LAW OR WHAT THIS NEW AUTHORITY MEANS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO WILL BE BETTER PROTECTED FROM BAD ACTORS AND PREDATORY PRACTICES HOWEVER IT IS OUR DUTY AS LEGISLATORS TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW IS BEING IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY. AND THAT THE FBI IS USING THIS NEW AUTHORITY WISELY THAT IS WHY AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW THE F. B. I.'S ACTIVITIES AND THIS IS THE IMPETUS FOR TODAY'S HEARING. SO TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM KEY D. FBI STAFF ON HOW THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION IS GONE AND I REALLY AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION TO BE HAD. THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN. THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME. YOU TO OUR FIRST OVERSIGHT HEARING RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LAW IS A TOP PRIORITY OF MINE IS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY OF YOU MAY KNOW WE STARTED A CONVERSATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE WANTED TO APPROACH THE GAPS IN OUR OVERSIGHT. A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WE HELD INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS AND INVITED INVITED THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SHARE HIS INSIGHTS ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM UNFAIR. DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE PRACTICES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. BUILDING OFF OF THAT HEARING AND YEARS OF WORK BY CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND EXPERIENCE REGULATORS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSED IN HIS TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET AND EXPANSION OF AND REMAINING OVER STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR PROTECTION INNOVATION. FORTY pBUDGET PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT PROVIDES THE FBI WITH BROAD AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE PROVIDERS OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS AND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS AUTHORITY WAS MODELED AFTER THE THIRTY PROVIDED BY CONGRESS WHEN IT CREATED THE CFPB. IN THE WAKE OF THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF INNOVATION IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THE CONSUMERS. GREATER COMFORT WITH TRANSACTIONS ONLINE THROUGH MOBILE APPS. I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THIS INNOVATION HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO CONSUMERS BY PROVIDING SERVICES MORE BROADLY MORE CONVENIENTLY AND LESS EXPENSIVELY THAN HISTORICAL BUSINESS MODELS. THAT SAID I THINK THAT THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS IS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF INNOVATION AND- SERVICES IS NOT. WITH ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THIS NEW LAW THAT WE PASSED INTO TWENTY WILL PROVIDE THE F. WITH MORE RESEARCH. AND AUTHORITYTO LAW. OUT FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN THE EVOLVING MARKET PLACE I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY TODAY AS WE LEARN ABOUT HOW THE NEW LAW. I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WE ARE. ONLY THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT THE-BUDGET WE APPROVED IN TWENTY TWENTY. EXPECTED A THREE TO FOUR YEAR RAMP UP IN THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIVITIES SO WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE ADMIN. IN MAKING THE- AND FINANCE PROTECTION LAWS SUCCESS. BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE ANNUAL REPORT.

THE AUTHORITY TO GOVERN THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS AND THE MANY TIMES- I HEAR THAT THE FUNDS HAD BEEN DEPLETED- AND THE STOLEN AND THAT THIS IS SECOND- PHENOM IN OUR- AND IT IS SUPPORTER TRUST BASIS- BUT THE- I AM WONDERING WHETHER THE- YOU AT THE HAS ANY COMPLAINTS OR CONCERNS SO- WHAT THE- LOW CAN BE ENACTED. TO PROTECT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION L. IS IT GIVES US THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE ALL. THE WHILE SOME ARE FEDERAL OF THOSE WHICH ARE STATE. AND WE ARE TARGETING FIRST OUR MOST. IN OUR POPULATION. AND THAT IS OUR SENIORS ARE SENIORS. AS WELL AS OUR MILITARY AS WELL AS OUR STUDENTS AS WELL AS OUR NEW AMERICANS AND IMMIGRANTS AND BILLS THAT ARE FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES LIKE ONES I GREW UP. SO THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL LASER FOCUS ON. BECAUSE BACK THOSE. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE MOST LONGER WHEN IT COMES TO PREDATORY LENDING AND WHEN IT COMES TO SCAM. I'D LIKE TO TURN TO BE HEAD OF OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION DIVISION FUDAN MARTIN DALES SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER THE BILL INTO SOME MORE DETAIL OF SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO FOCUS ON OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION- YOU'RE REFERRING TO SITUATIONS THAT- YOU KNOW COULD BE ELDER FINANCIAL FRAUD AND ABUSE- I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER WITH DEMENTIA SO THIS HITS VERY CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME- YOU KNOW WE'D AS THE COMMISSIONER RIGHTLY STATES WE DO ENFORCE YOU KNOW CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS THAT DO PROHIBIT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES.

YOU KNOW WE DO TALK REGULARLY TO OUR CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND YOU WERE FOR POTENTIAL CRIMINAL MATTERS THAT WAY SO YOU KNOW WE DO FEEL THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT WE CAN FORCE IN THE CIVIL CONTEXT WHICH TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DETECT POTENTIAL CRIMINAL FRAUD WE WOULD WERE THAT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE TO FOLLOW UP YOUR OFFICE ON THE BE LIKE TO JUST. THIS IN MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME CHOI CHECK GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR THE MOMENT AND ADDS INTERESTED IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DESCRIBE THE DEPARTMENT'S APPROACH TO PRIORITIZING REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS BY LET'S SAY BY TYPE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR OR SERVICE. YES WHAT WE DO AND DETERMINE THE PRIORITIES FOR REGISTRATION WE TAKE SEVERAL FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. FIRST WE TAKE THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS. SECOND WE TAKE THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE THEM FROM CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND I WOULD INDICATE. WE REVIEW EVEY SINGLE THING SOMEWHERE COMPLAINT BECOMES. AND WE HAVE A STAFF THAT INCLUDES HI TRAINED LEAD PROFESSOR. WE REVIEW IN. THAT WE RECEIVE NO PUBLIC INPUT AND THAT IS WHY SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET OUT. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR US IN SETTING OUR PRIORITIES. AND WE REVIEW THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY HOLDING STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND ROUNDTABLES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND THROUGH THE SOURCES OF THIS INFORMATION WE IDENTIFY PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT ARE POSING A RISK TO THE CONSUMER. LARA ARE INCREASING IN MARKET SHARE AND COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME REGULATORY CLEARANCE. AND THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH BASED ON THAT INFORMATION LOOK FOR PRODUCT CATEGORIES OF DEBT SETTLEMENT STUDENT DEBT RELIEF SERVICES PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION FINANCING AND EARNED WAGE AXIS BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS JUST THE FIRST WAY. THIS IS JUST THE FIRST WAY INFORMATION FROM THE AREAS THAT I JUST MENTIONED THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES. AND PENDING FURTHER RESEARCH INVESTIGATION AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THOSE CATEGORIES WILL ONLY EXPAND. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE FOLLOW IT ALL OF THESE REGULATIONS. B. PROCESS AS THE FINE. UNDER THE LAW INVITES ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND WE REGULARLY UPDATE. LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE STAFF REGARDING OUR PROGRESS ON THE REGULATIONS YOU COMMISSIONER THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS NEXT QUESTION AND I ONLY MET THAT I'D I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE WORK OF THE F. B. I.'S NEW RESEARCH TEAM AND THE TOPICS OF STUDY WILL IT BE PUBLISHING DATA pREASON WHY I ASK THIS QUESTION IS BECAUSE- THERE'S INTEREST IN ISSUES OF ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE ANY DATA ON WHAT TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES CALIFORNIANS ARE USING AND HOW THIS IS CHANGING OVER TIME. YES YOU'RE RIGHT I'M VERY PASSIONATE BECAUSE OUR BRANDING FUNCTION FOR OUR DEPARTMENT- WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT HAD- DATA SCIENCES ONBOARD. WE HAVE THEM NOW AND WE'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF UPDATING OUR BUSINESS- PROCESSES AND WE ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THERE'S A GREAT AMOUNT OF STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS IN THIS DATA WHICH WILL INFORM OUR PRIORITIES INTO THE FUTURE. ALSO WILL GIVE ALL OF US A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE TRENDS ARE IN THESE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. NOW FOR NOW AS OUR RESEARCH TEAM. IS ANALYZING THE DATA IT IS CONFIDENTIAL PURSUANT TO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE WITHTHE NUMEROUS COMPANIES THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE DATA. BUT WE DO HOPE IN THE FUTURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUBLICIZE AT A HIGH LEVEL THE AGGREGATE FINALLY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER MARTIN DALE WHO HAS JUST AS MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS AREA VALUE IF NOT MORE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER- AND USED TO BUILD UPON- THE COMMISSIONER'S RESPONSE I KNOW WE LAUNCHED OUR RESEARCH TEAM LAST FALL SO IT IS EARLY DAYS WE NEVER HAD RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST IN OUR DEPARTMENT BEFORE SO WE'RE REALLY STARTING BY WITH DOING A THREE SIXTY INTERNALLY. KNOW WHAT DATA SOURCES DO WE HOW DO WE HAVE THE TOOLS WE NEED TO DO THE KIND OF DATA ANALYTICS THAT IS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CCF PL SO WE CAN BE FIRST AND FOREMOST A SMARTER ABOUT HOW WE DO. HOW WE ALLOCATE OUR OWN INTERNAL RESOURCES AND PRIORITIZE OUR ISSUES BUT THEN YES WE DO HOPE ARE GOING FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THIS TEAM TO PROVIDE DATA TO THE PUBLIC A REGARDING- WHAT WE'RE LEARNING MARKET TRENDS- SO YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE SOME WORKSTREAMS ALREADY IN FLIGHT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE IS GREAT STAKEHOLDER INTEREST IN SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING AND- ANALYZING. IN TERMS OF GETTING YOUR CUSTOMER LEVEL DATA INDICATE CONSUMER USAGE THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN PART BECAUSE SOME COMPANIES DON'T EVEN COLLECT THAT KIND OF DATA BUT WE ARE GOING TO LEVERAGE WHATEVER DATA SOURCES WE CAN GET. DIRECTLY FROM COMPANIES FROM REGULATORY PARTNERS AND YOU HOPE TO OUT YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD BE ABLE TO- RELEASED YOU KNOW PUBLIC AGGREGATE INFORMATION- SO THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING WHAT MORE. LEARNING AND IDENTIFYING MARKET TRENDS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MY FINAL QUESTION. AND IT'S JUST REALLY ABOUT. A D. F. P. EYES APPROACH WHAT IS THE APPROACH OF FOR DF PI. IN CONSIDERATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS- IN PARTICULAR CRYPTO. WELL THE BEAUTY OF THE C. F. P. YEAH IS IT GAVE US THE AUTHORITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE SOME WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE CRYPTO CURRENCY I WANTED TO PUT THAT ISSUE TO REST. BUT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE IN ACCORDING WILL BE A MINISTRATION PROCEDURES AT. AND ACCORDING TO THE TIMELINE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES THAT BUT FIRST OFF I DO BELIEVE THAT IN DEVELOPING REGULATION. ONE DOESN'T DO IT IN A VACUUM. REGULATION IS A VERY DYNAMIC AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE MEETING WITH. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE MET WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS ALREADY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY LAYS ARENA M. I'M MEETING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AREA OF CRYPTO CURRENCY. FROM THE CONSUMERS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY IT CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPANIES. THE BANKS WHICH MAY BE HOLDING CRYPTOCURRENCY OR INVOLVED IN LOANS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY. AND RUN THAT INFORMATION WE WILL THEN LOOK AS WE DO IN EVERY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. VETERANS WITH CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THE RESULTS OF OUR INVESTIGATION AT ALL PUBLIC INPUT IS STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. AND THEN WE WILL DRAFT REGULATIONS THAT WILL THEN GO THROUGH THE A MINISTRY TO PROCEDURE SO THAT EVERY VOICE IS HEARD IN THIS AREA AND WHEN I MEAN EVERY BOYS I NEED EVERY POLICE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF AS WELL MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS- HEY DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I'LL I GUESS I'LL JUST PIGGY BACK ON WHAT YOU'RE GRAYSON JUST ASKED YOU- THIS MORNING AT ABOUT NINE AM- THERE WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER RELEASED BY OUR GOVERNOR RELATED- TO DIGITAL ASSETS AND I AM WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON IT- GIVING YOUR ROLE COME IN BROADLY ON IT GIVING YOUR ROLE IN- REGULATING THEM AND DIGITAL CURRENCIES BUT ALSO BEING SUPPORTIVE OF FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND OF COURSE KEEPING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN MIND- ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS OR REACTIONS THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH US. YES THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WE EMBRACE BIG SECOND QUARTER. IN A FIRM. ALREADY M. C. C. F. P. L. TO REGULATE CRYPTO. AND DIGITAL ASSETS IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADER. AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WE ARE THE LEADER AND ALL EYES ARE LOOKING RIGHT NOW TO SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO DO. I WE ARE THE LEADER BECAUSE- WE HAVE THE BEST IN TERMS OF RESEARCH AND THE BALLOT INVESTMENT IN VENTURE CAPITAL IN CRYPTOCURRENCY THAN ANY OTHER CITY OR STATE IN THE COUNTRY IN FACT WHEN YOU COMPARE. CALIFORNIA ANY OTHER. STATE LIKE NINE TIMES WITH THAT. WE ARE THE LEADER OF THE FUTURE YEAH I JUST GOT FINISHED- BEING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ROLE THE BEARS OUT THERE OF THE CATALAN LICENSE ISSUED OF UC BERKELEY. AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE MIDDLE OF UC BERKELEY SURROUNDED BY. THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS THAT WERE UNDER MY CARE THROUGH A SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. AND RUBIO STUDENTS I WAS ABLE TO REALLY CITIES OF THE FUTURE. THEY TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT CRYPTO. AND DIGITAL ASSETS. THEN I EVEN LEARNED AS AN ATORNEY SO IT IS THE FUTURE. AND WE NEED TO EMBRACE THE FUTURE EVENTS COMING BUT WHAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS SAYING AS WE ARE RACING INNOVATION AND RACING IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO AT THE VERY BEGINNING NEED TO WOW WERE ENCOURAGING INNOVATION ENSURE THAT THERE IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHERE WE MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE EMBRACED INNOVATION. BUT WE DON'T GET TO THE- CONSUMER PROTECTION IN SO MANY YEARS LATER WELL NOW WE'RE STARTING WITH THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FIRST RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO EMPHASIZES ENCOURAGES US AS WE SHOULD THE TAKE. AND CONSIDER. AS WE DEVELOP THESE REGULATIONS ONE IS EQUITY. AND THAT EQUITY ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR ME. AND I MENTION WHERE I GREW UP IN RURAL POVERTY IN INNER CITY. AND USUALLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCTS COME OUT THE TABLE LET ALONE TO EVEN KNOW TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE SURE. BUT THOSE COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR HAVE A SEAT AND A VOICE AT THE TABLE. AND LAST AREA THAT A LOT OF TIMES IN THE INNOVATION WE TEND TO FORGET ABOUT. IS LOOKING AT THE IMPACT AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE USING THE BEST PRACTICES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SO BACK AND WE CAN LEAVE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS A PLANET THAT WE CAN THEY CAN ENJOY AS MUCH AS WE HAVE BEEN. SO WE WELCOME. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT STATES THOSE PRINCIPLES AND REALIZES THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL. IN THE BLOCKCHAIN THERE IS POTENTIAL IN CRYPTOCURRENCY THERE'S POTENTIAL IN THE INNOVATION OF DIGITAL ASSETS FOR THE GOOD. AND IT'S OUR JOB WITH THE FBI THE HAVE THAT POTENTIAL RIDE. BUT ANYTHING IN REGARDS TO PREDATORY LENDING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMMUNITIES I JUST MENTIONED ENFORCE THE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT D. F. P. EYES A THIRTY WAS AFFIRMED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND I DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE TO URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP THE FBI AS THE LEADING AGENCY- THAT SETS THE REGULATORY APPROACH FOR THIS EMERGING. INDUSTRY I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S VERY IN LINE TO THE COMMENT THAT YOU JUST SHARED WITH US. ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION THAT I HAVE EASE. NOTE TWO KEY I'M WONDERING IF YOU OR- PERHAPS IT DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AS- TATER- ED CAN NAY COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON THE OR DESCRIBE.

AND THAT IS OUR BANKS AND OUR CREDIT UNIONS WHICH ALSO HAVE A STATE IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION TO OUR REGULAR MEETINGS AND DIALOGUE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES. SO I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE SITTING THERE ARE IN THE PUBLIC THE CIVIL THERE MET WITH ME AT. WE'RE COMING TO YOU. AND I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO TEACHER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TODAY D. I AM. TODAY'S HERE REQUIRES A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH AND IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON ENSURING THANKS FOR AND ENSURING ALIGNMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PROVIDE GREATER CLARITY TO THE CRYPTO ASSET INDUSTRY AS WELL AS SECURE BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION. IT OUTLINES AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS SO WE THAT WE AT THE END- INSURING THIS CONSISTENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIC TO WHAT THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION DOES IN TERMS OF OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CRYPTO ASSET INDUSTRY I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE'VE HAD AND ANY NUMBER OF MEETINGS. WITH INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS THE WE HAVE AN OPEN DOOR AS THE COMMISSIONER SAID IN HER EARLIER REMARKS AND WE HAVE HAD- TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CRYPTO ASSET INDUSTRY RANGING FROM THE EARLIEST EARLIEST STAGES TO ESTABLISH LICENSEES WHO ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS INTO THE CRYPT ENTERED CRYPTO ASSET- RELATED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR GOAL IN ALL OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HEY TO SHARE DEPARTMENT RESOURCES SO WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTE CLARITY ABOUT EXPECTATIONS WE ENCOURAGES BUSINESS BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO COME IN EACH WITH OUR OFFICE. AND WE ARE EAGER TO SUPPORT RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THAT OS TI OFFICE IS TO SUPPORT RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION AND KEEP JOBS HERE AND HELP GROW THE. INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. GREAT THANK YOU. I THINK THAT TO- GET GIVEN THIS CONVERSATION AND I KNOW THAT THE INTEREST THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE HAD AN INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC I DO HOPE THAT AT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF. WE ARE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY ANY WAYS. THAT WE CAN FURTHER STRENGTHEN AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS SPACE PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE GAPS IN OUR EXISTING LAWS INCLUDING SECURITY LAWS- THAT WOULD APPLY TO DIGITAL ASSETS I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT ANYTHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND I SEE NODS AT THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY INTERESTED IN BEING A PARTNER. IN IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE. I'M IN MY FINAL QUESTION IS JUST RELATED TO YOU KNOW FOR THE COMMISSIONER JUST OVER ARCHING WE'VE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT A DIGITAL ASSETS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY TIMELY AND IT YOU KNOW. A CONVERSATION BUT AS AS YOU THINK OF YOUR OVERALL- WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE- IS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN COMMISSIONER SINCE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. TODAY WHAT CAN YOU SAY ARE THE THREE ISSUES. THAT WE ARE FACING- THAT CONSUMERS ARE ARE REALLY FACING- IN IN THE FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS. LANDS OR SPACE CAN YOU JUST COMMENT GENERALLY AND I'M NOT LOOKING FOR EXAMPLES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT JUST YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF WHAT CONSUMERS MOST CARE ABOUT. IN CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. AND I THINK IN MENTIONING OUR PRIORITIES- IT WILL ALSO BE SORT OF INDIATIVE OF WHAT. CONSUMERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. BECAUSE OUR PRIORITIES ARE DEVELOPED FIRST AND FOREMOST WITH THE CONSUMER IN MIND IN WHERE WE HAVE RECEIVED OF THE MOST. BACK. ONE IS- HELPING CONSUMERS WITH COMPLAINTS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF SCAMS AND PREDATORY LENDING. AND IT'S REALLY VITAL THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM. TO HELP THEM WIN THE COMPLAINTS THIS IS WHY. OUR COMPLAINT DIVISION ANSWERS THE CALL WITHIN TWO MINUTES. THIS IS WHY WE GET BACK TO OUR CONSUMERS WITHIN SEVEN DAYS M. A. R. COMPLAINING THE VISION IS CENTERED ON COMPLAINT FOR RESOLUTION WE WORK WITH HIM BUT CONSUMERS TO HELP THEM RESOLVE THE COMPLAINT. WE REACH OUT TO THE COMPANIES. AND IF THE COMPANIES OUR RESPONSE. THEN WE TURN IT OVER TO ENFORCEMENT. MORE THAN EVER CONSUMERS NEED THAT ASSISTANCE AND A. NEED THEIR ASSISTANCE IN PARTICULAR. WITH THE FBI LICENSEES. THAT WE'RE NOT LICENSE PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD. I WOULD ALSO- I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE CONSUMERS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WHERE TO GO TO FILE A COMPLAINT. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE IN CHARGE OF A NUMBER OF KEY INITIATIVES THAT ARE STILL NEAR AND DEAR TO CONSUMERS ONE OF THEM BEING. WHERE IS WE'RE STARTING TO STUDENT BORROWERS CAMPAIGN. AND WHICH WE ARE LAUNCHING WE HOPE WITH THE PASSAGE OF. THE BUDGET A TEN MILLION DOLLAR MARKETING AND COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN. WHICH ALSO INCLUDES. GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT KNOW HOW TO GET TO REACH THE CONSUMERS THE BETH AM WORKING BESIDE AND ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY AND REACHING THE CONSUMERS WETHERBY I'M FINANCIAL EDUCATION. OR. HOW TO REPAY YOUR STUDENT LOAN BEING EDUCATED ABOUT. PUBLIC LOAN FORGIVENESS IS. OUR STUDENTS ARE STUDENT GRADUATES ARE OUR FUTURE. M. ARE OF SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CONSUMER POPULATION. SO OUR OUT REACH. IS GOING TO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AS TO THAT. CONSUMER PORTION OF OUR POPULATION AS IT IS TO THE MILITARY SENIORS AND IMMIGRANTS. AND I'M ALSO LIKE TO MENTION. ANOTHER LEVEL OF CONSUMER. VERY RARELY EVER GETS MENTION. AND THAT IS ARE UNDERBANKED POPULATIONS. MANY WHO COME FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES AND INNER CITY COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED FDF PI. THOUGH IT MAY NOT FALL DIRECTLY UNDER THE C. F. P. L. AND HOW WE CAN HAVE FINANCIAL SERVICES. DELIVERED TO THOSE POPULATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY A HIGH FEE. WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON THAT AREA. THAT WE ARE EVEN LOOKING BEYOND THE UNITED STATES WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING GLOBALLY IN OTHER COUNTRIES. LIKE INDIA. IN COUNTRIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LABELED AS THIRD WORLD BUT I SEEM TO HAVE ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM OF DELIVERING ECONOMIC BELIEVE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THOSE POPULATIONS. AND WE LOVE THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION AND THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION AND OTHERS THAT ARE CONCENTRATED ON THAT AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING RIGHT ALONGSIDE THEM. SO WHEN WE SAY CONSUMERS. CONSUMERS AS A WHOLE. IS HELPING THEM WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS HELPING THEM TO RESOLVE THEIR COMPLAINTS BEING THERE FOR THEM TEACHING THEM ABOUT THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE REST AS WELL AS THE BENEFITS. ALSO GETTING INDEED TO THE TARGETED POPULATIONS THERE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND PROVIDING THEM SUPPORT. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND I WILL SAY THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU KNOW HEARING YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK SO OFTEN THERE'S SO MUCH OF THE DEPARTMENT CAN O AND- SEEN THAT WITH THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE ARE DOING IS HELPING EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN AND WHO ARE CALLING THE DEPARTMENT ASKING FOR HELP TO NAVIGATE. US YOU KNOW THAT THEIR CONNECTION WAIT WITH OUR FINANCIAL COMPANIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR AN A DEFINITELY IN THE MIDDLE OF SO MANY EXCITING PROJECTS AND DIRECTIONS- I AM GLAD THAT WE ARE NOT LOSING SITES THAT JUST ANSWERING THE PHONE WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN HAS A QUESTION. IS AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO- AND CERTAINLY I THINK EVEN SOME OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICES- THROUGH- THE PANDEMIC HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND HAVE HELPED OUR CONSTITUENTS I WITH SOME OF THIS BUT HAVING AN AGENCY THAT WE CAN TURN TO- IT IS REALLY KEY AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ALSO NOT FORGETTING THE MANY. DIFFERENT TYPES OF GROUPS THAT MAKE UP CONSUMERS INCLUDING STUDENTS- IMMIGRANTS AND THE- UNDERBANKED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE DO MORE FOR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND CERTAINLY SOME OF. THE ONES THAT- HAVE HAD SOME OF THE HARDER CHALLENGING IN ACCESSING. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES THAT THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THEM. I KNOW THAT YOU WORKED REALLY HARD- AS WELL BECAUSE I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT. ONE THING THAT IS THAT THAT'S VERY. INTERESTING TO ME IS THE FACT THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN A MORE REGULAR WAY THROUGH OUTREACH AND THE NUMBER OF SURVEYS THAT I'VE SEEN IT COME OUT AND FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT ASKING CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S TO GIVE FEEDBACK- IS ALSO A THINK REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A PIECE THAT WE DON'T OFTEN DO THAT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE DON'T OFTEN DO BUT THIS OPEN ENDED. GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE- OF CONCERN TO YOU I THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT I'VE HAD CONSTITUENTS COMMENT THAT.
