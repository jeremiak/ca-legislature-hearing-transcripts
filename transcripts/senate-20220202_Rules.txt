MY FIRST TERM GOALS FOCUSED ON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABILITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND PROMOTING FORUMS FOR DISCUSSION. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING CAN WITH THE HAND GEN AND ANGLING COMMUNITY. CONSERVATION STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND TRIBAL NATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. I WORK HARD TO LISTEN TO ALL SIDES OF THE MANY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES BROUGHT BEFORE THE COMMISSION. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING TO CO CREATE THE COMMISSION'S TRIBAL COMMITTEE. THE FIRST COST TRAVEL CONSULTATION POLICY THE FIRST CO MANAGEMENT. VISION STATEMENT AND DEFINITION. THE COMMISSION NOW ALSO HAS THE SUPPORT OF A FULL TIME TRIBAL ADVISOR ON STAFF THESE MILESTONES HAVE BEEN LONG OVERDUE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE MY FAMILY WHO'S WATCHING AND ESPECIALLY MY DAUGHTER WILL LAST WHO IS SEVEN AND MY SON WRITER WHO'S NINE. THANKS TO ALL MY FAMILY FOR THEIR SUPPORT MY NAME IS SAMANTHA MARIE AND I'M CURRENTLY THE VICE PRESIDENTS OF THE FISH AND GAM COMMISSION I WAS HERE BEFORE YOU JUST TWO SHORT YEARS AGO ALTHOUGH IT FEELS A BIT LIKE A LIFETIME AGO WHEN WE HAD THAT CONFIRMATION HEARING IT WAS THE LAST WORK TRIP THAT I TOOK BEFORE THAT COVERED PANDEMIC- I DO ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM JOINING FROM NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO. ON THE TRADITIONAL AND ANCESTRAL TERRITORY OF THE COMMAND NATION THAT'S CERTAINLY RELEVANT TO THE WORK WE DO ON THE COMMISSION TOLD CALIFORNIA'S FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THEIR HABITATS IN THE PUBLIC TRUST. I AM HONORED TO SERVE ON THIS COMMISSION WITH AN ABSOLUTELY STELLAR STAFF AND FOR TALENTED THOUGHTFUL COMMISSIONERS. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR POINTINGME TO THIS POSITION. WHICH I SORT OF FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE. I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN MINNESOTA CALLED WINONA WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHERE AS A KID I WON FIFTEEN TROPHIES FROM AS YOUNG AS SIX YEARS OLD. I GREW UP POSING FOR PHOTOS NEXT TO GUIDED DEER HANGING IN MY GARAGE IN A HOUSE FULL OF PRINCE SPIDERS AND GRILL SETS ONE AT DUCKS UNLIMITED FUNDRAISERS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I GREW UP WITH A STRONG CONNECTION TO AND DEEP RESPECT FOR THE HUNTERS AND FISHERMEN OF THE U. S. AND I UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE CRITICAL ROLE THESE COMMUNITIES PLAN CONSERVATION. TODAY I TEACH AND MENTOR GRADUATE STUDENTS EXPLORING NATURAL RESOURCE CHALLENGES FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES WHERE WE CONSIDER THE LAW THE SCIENCE ECONOMICS. AND THE SOCIAL JUSTICE IMPLICATIONS OF OCEAN CONSERVATION ISSUES. IN MY VIEW WE ARE SORT OF OUT OF SILVER BULLET FIXES TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN OUR OCEAN AND LAND. SOLUTIONS TODAY MUST BE INTERDISCIPLINARY AND REQUIRE INNOVATION AND NEW ONES CREATIVITY AND I'D ARGUE A WHOLE LOT OF EMPATHY. I WORK HARD TO BRING THIS HISTORY THIS EXPERIENCE AND THIS APPROACH TO MY WORK ON THE COMMISSION EVERY DAY AND I'M HUMBLED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE- OF FINALLY LET'S GO TO MRS OF ALETTA AND ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE FOLKS TO MAKE COMMENTS WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM PRETENDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY INTRODUCING MY HUSBAND BERNIE pFIFTEEN. AND MY DAUGHTER NADIA WHO IS TWELFTH THIS IS STRANGE TO DO AN EXAM BUT- I WANTED TO BE HERE ALSO ATTENDING REMOTELY OR MY OLDER SON'S BEEN IN RATE AND MY PARENTS UMBERTO UNSEREM SEVERAL FM A SIBLINGS ALEXIS AND MARCELO. MY PHD MENTOR STANFORD EMERITUS PROFESSOR HOW MANY IN MANY OF MY WONDERFUL COLLEAGUES AND CURRENT AND FORMER STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SO I JOIN. FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TEN MONTHS AGO AND I'M HONORED AND GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE WHICH CONNECTS MANY PARTS OF MY WORK AND LIFE. MY PARENTS IMMIGRATED TO THE U. S. FROM TWO DIFFERENT CONTINENTS AND I GREW UP LEARNING FIRST HAND ABOUT THE VALUE. OF DIVERSE CULTURES AND% pWERE SCARCE IN MY BIG CITY HOME NATURAL SPACES WERE ALSO PRECIOUS TO ME MOST FASCINATED BY WILDLIFE ESPECIALLY BY TRYING TO CATCH IT. AND IN COLLEGE I REALIZED THAT I WAS CAPTIVATED NOT JUST BY THE WILDLIFE BUT EVEN MORE BY THE DIVERSITY OF WAYS THAT PEOPLE RELATE TO IT. AND DEPEND ON IT. SO A LOT OF MY RESEARCH AS A GRADUATE STUDENT AND AS A YOUNG PROFESSOR ADDRESSED HOW HUNTERS RELATE TO THE ANIMALS THEY HUNT. IN THE PLACES THEY CONTENT. AND HOW TO PROTECT SUBSISTENCE LIVELIHOODS AS WELL FIRE AND CLIMATE CHANGE ALTERED THE FOREST AROUND TRADITIONAL HUNTING AND FISHING COMMUNITIES. TODAY I AM A PROFESSOR OF ECOLOGY A FIELD SCIENTIST AN AVID HUNTER I'M SORRY HIKER FISHER AND NATURALIST. MY CAREER'S BEEN ABOUT CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY AND ITS BENEFITS TO PEOPLE. AND ABOUT SHARING THAT RICHNESS AND THAT WORK WITH OTHER CALIFORNIANS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING THE MANY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS THAT I'VE TAUGHT AT UC SANTA CRUZ. I'VE USED DURING LAND WATER AND WILDLIFE WHICH I THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AS- THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF OUR GENERATION AND SOME HONOR TO BE ABLE TO SERVE CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE THAT. THANK SO MUCH SO APPRECIATE YOUR SPOUSE AND I. YOUNG PEOPLE BE AND WILLING TO BE ON SCREEN AND PUT IN A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR THEIR MOM- I'M GOING TO TURN OUR FIRST TWO US SENATOR LAYERED AND- HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE TIME FOR. ALL SENATORS TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I APOLOGIZE UP TO STEP UP ABOUT TEN MINUTES IN CASE PEOPLE ARE STILL ANSWERING BUT IT IS GREAT I KNOW ALL THREE OF YOU A I WAS INVOLVED WITH. JACKIE WHEN SHE WAS APPOINTED A CEMENT THE WORKED ON BRING PROTECTION AND- AND I JUST LEARNED WHO ERICA IS MARRIED TO I DID NOT REALIZE THAT SO- AND SHE IS DOOMING FROM NOT FAR FROM MY HOME I WISH I WAS WHERE SHE WAS- TODAY. I THOUGHT I HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING WITH ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY. AND I THOUGHT THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK ABOUT- BECAUSE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ALL THREE OF YOU AND WHAT THE RESPONSES WERE AND WHAT YOUR LEVEL OF COMMITMENT IS AND WHAT YOU BRING TO THE COMMISSION. BUT THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. OR SOMETHING THAT FALL WITH IN THIS THEY'VE BEEN VERY CONTENTIOUS AND THEY ARE NOT AS CONTENTIOUS ANYMORE. AND I WAS GOING TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT AND I KNOW THAT THEIR ISSUES OF CO MANAGEMENT. AND THERE'S ISSUES OF DEFINING SUSTENANCE THAT WHAT'S IN THE AGREEMENT. WITH TRIBES TO BRING THEM INTO SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH THEIR NEEDS WITH MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND I WAS HOPING EACH ONE OF YOU. ARE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE WOULD BE GOOD TO GO IN THE ORDER THAT YOU PRESENTED SO IT'S CLEAR WHO'S CALLING AND SO BEGIN WITH JACKIE GO TO SAMANTHA AND THEN. I TOOK CARE. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- AS YOU KNOW I HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY. WITHIN THE MARINE LIFE PROTECTION ACT EARLY DAYS. BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND BEING INVOLVED WITH THE AND ON THE NORTH COAST REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER BOARD FOR IN HERE IS- I DO HAVE A STRONG COMMITMENT. TO SEEING SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES- AND AS YOU KNOW. DID YOU CHANNEL MANAGEMENT REVIEW AT THE TEN YEAR A REVIEW OF. WE'RE OUT WITH MPA'S IS LOOKING POSITIVE- WORKING WITH THE TRIBES DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK. IN OUR TRIBALLY. DOING RESEARCH AND PROJECTS. GROUPING TRIBES TOGETHER ON OUR TRAVEL COMMITTEE IT IS ALWAYS A TO A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION- I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN RESOURCES REBOUNDING- BUT AGAIN MY WORK HAS BEEN TRIBALLY WITHIN THE MPA AREAS WE WERE ABLE TO GET TRAVEL- THE SUBSISTENCE WITHIN SOME STATE MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS. AND I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE FUTURE OUTCOMES IN THE COMMISSION WILL BE LOOKING OUT THAT REVIEW- AND WITHOUT. OUT COMING IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWO MARIE. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR LAYERED SO I TOO WAS INVOLVED IN THAT MARINE LIFE PROTECTION ACT PROCESS I THINK STARTING JUST AT THE END OF THE CENTRAL COAST PROCESS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I SAT ON THE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS- FOR THE NORTH CENTRAL COAST. AND SO I TO SHARE A COMMITMENT TO THAT- TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR OUR NETWORK OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. IN TERMS OF THE DECATUR MANAGEMENT REVIEW YOU KNOW THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING INFORMATION SINCE THE BEGINNING WE'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY. DUE TO THE STATES AS WELL AS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO HAVE ON GOING BASELINE AND LONG TERM MONITORING. SO WE KNOW THAT IN OUR MPAS WERE YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY DAYS BUT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE POSITIVE RESULTS AND RESULTS ARE PROMISING WE'RE GETTING BIGGER MORE FISH OF GREATER DIVERSITY. WITHIN MPA BOUNDARIES ESPECIALLY IN OUR OLDER MPAS LIKE THOSE AT POINT LOBOS. AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING DOCUMENTED CASES OF SPILLOVER WHICH IS HARD TO DOCUMENT. ABOUT THE DNA IS HELPFUL FOR THAT. AND AND IN SOME CASES RESILIENCY OF ECOSYSTEMS IS GOING UP THERE WAS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT THAT SHOWED THAT- HABITATS AND WILDLIFE INSIDE MPAS- I WORK WERE MORE RESISTANCE TO INVASIVE SARGASSUM. COMPLIANCE IS ALSO GETTING BETTER- WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE FOLKS UNDERSTANDING AND FOLLOWING THE RULES. AND MPAS AS WELL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AROUND A GOLF GONZALEZ PASSED. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE SEVERAL YEARS AGO- THAT SET A MINIMUM. FINE FOR A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR VIOLATIONS AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT- THAT BLL IN TERMS. OF COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. I THE QUESTION YOU'RE SPECIFIC OF TRIBES SENATOR LAYERED YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE THOSE OF US WHO WERE INVOLVED IN AND PROBABLY THOSE WHO WARRANT COULD AGREE THAT THE FACT THAT THE MLK WAS SILENCE ON TRIBES. I WAS A MAJOR SOCIAL JUSTICE OVERSIGHTS I THINK THAT WE ALL SEE THAT AND YOU KNOW. JACKIE ARE COMMISSIONER HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WAS WAS VERY INVOLVED IN NAVIGATING THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE OVERSIGHT AND FINDING A WAY THROUGH- THAT WAS THAT WAS RIGHT BY THE TRIBES. ONE THING THOUGH THAT HAS THERE BEEN MANYPOSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR TRIBES ACT I AS I SEE IT MORE I SAID. THEY CAME OUT OF THE M. P. AFTERWARDS AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IS RELATED. TO YOUR QUESTION CENTER LAYERED IS THE TRIBAL MARINE STEWARDS NETWORK PILOT PROGRAM- THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL JUST FUNDED A MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PLANS TO SUPPORT THE DEVLOPMENT OF THIS MARINE STEWARDS NETWORK PILOT PROGRAM- THAT WILL ALLOW TRIBES TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR RESEARCH AND MONITORING OF NPA'S. ENGAGEMENT WITH TRIBES COLLECTING AND SHARING DATA AND THEN FIGURING OUT HOW TO SCALE THAT UP SO. I THINK- IN TERMS OF THE COMMANDMENTS AND THE DEFINITION OF SUBSISTENCE I WOULD LEAVE THAT ANSWER TO COMMISSIONER HOUSE APARTMENTS AND IS THAT IT THE CHAIR OF THE TRIBAL COMMITTEE. BUT IN TERMS OF- TRIBAL ENGAGEMENTS ON MPA'S MOVING FORWARD I'M JUST SO DELIGHTED AND EXCITED TO SEE IF- INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE APPROPRIATELY AND THOUGHTFULLY WOVEN INTO- OUR MPA NETWORK AND. AND THE MANAGEMENT- IMPIOUS. THANK YOU I DOCTORS A LETTER. THANK YOU- WE SHOULD BE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DONE WITH THE MTA NETWORK IT'S A MODEL FOR THE WORLD AND- I THINK THAT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS BEYOND THE MANY IMPORTANT POINTS THAT MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS HAVE RAISED- SO YOU KNOW NOT ONLY AM I PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IS A STATE AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THAT THE NPA'S AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY'RE WORKING BUT WE'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO THAT WE'RE GOING FOR IT AND- I THINK THAT. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SCIENTIST YOU SCIENCE IS A PROCESS SO WE'RE CONTINUALLY LEARNING NOT ONLY ABOUT HOW THEY ARE WORKING TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL SPECIES AND FISHERIES- BUT ALSO WHERE WE CAN REFINE REGULATION AROUND THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OVER TIME AS WE LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED- I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW ON THE ON THE SUBJECT OF TRIBES IT IS A PRIORITY OF THE OF THE GOVERNOR TO INCREASE TRAVEL ACCESS SUBSISTENCE INCOME MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL EDUCATION FOR ME TO. PARTICIPATE WITH COMMISSIONER HOSLER COMMONSENSE IN ALL OF THE TRAVEL COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE I JOINED THE COMMISSION LAST YEAR- I CAN SEE HUGE POTENTIAL FOR US AS A COMMISSION. AROUND RAIN PROTECT AREAS BUT ALSO MORE BROADLY TO BE INCORPORATING INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE. AND INCORPORATING THOSE THOSE TRAVEL PARTNERS INTO THE WORK THAT WE DO AND INTO THE DECISION MAKING THAT WE DO- I THINK. ONE OF THE FRONTIERS FOR US WITH THE MPAS. SENATOR THERE IT IS THAT SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT SOME OF THE SPECIES THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THEM- THE SAM AND THE STEEL HEAD. THAT DEPEND ON BOTH THE OCEAN AND THE INLAND RIVERS ND STREAMS AND SO ON IN CALIFORNIA- NEED HELP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT LAND C. INTERFACE IS NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. ARE THE LAND AND SEA CONNECTED AS THEY ARE IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY GOT MORE THAN HERE- AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE CAN PUSH FOR IT WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE OCEAN. AND THE COAST- IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF THOSE MPAS TO PROTECT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE INTENDED THEM TO. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THOSE COMMENTS EACH OF YOU LET ME I TURN NOW TO SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU- TO THE THREE OF YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICE I'M- APOLOGIES FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO- MEET WITH YOU BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING BUT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THROUGH THE MATERIALS. I AM. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION AND EACH OF YOU- CAN RESPOND YOU KNOW I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES IT ISN'T URBAN CENTER- THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ACTUALLY- JUST RECENTLY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT TALKED ABOUT. URBAN FISHING IN LOS ANGELES- AND SPECIFICALLY THE ACTIVITIES THAT FISHING ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPEN. IN THE L. A. RIVER- WHICH YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THIS- WATER WAY IS MORE REMINISCENT OF AN OVERSIZED STORM DRAINS THAN A RIVER AND YET EVEN WITH THAT- THERE IS MARINELIFE HAPPENING AND- URBAN FISHING HAPPENING- WHICH I THINK IS GREAT. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW HOW YOU WILL EXPAND- OUT REACH AND INTEREST- TO FOLKS IN URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES- AS IT RELATES TO THE COMMISSION BECAUSE I THINK OFTENTIMES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS COMMISSION WERE THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW RURAL AREAS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT- THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SORT OF YOU KNOW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THERE ARE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE WITH- FOLKS IN URBAN CENTERS LIKE LOS ANGELES ON THAT ARE MORE CONCRETE THAN GREEN- AS IT RELATES TO THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPACT. AND YOUR MISSION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME A START IN THE SAME ORDER- SO MISS HOSLER HARMISON WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD KNOW WHAT COMES TO MIND IS THE- DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE R. THREE AND THERE SHOULD HAVE WHICH IS TO RECRUIT RETRAIN. AND RE ACTIVATE- PARTICIPATION AND ACCESS FOR HUNTING AND FISHING. I THINK THAT IS JUST AN AMAZING PROGRAM AND IT'S ALSO A NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT FOCUSED ON REVERSING THE DECLINE IN HUNTING AND FISHING AND SHOOTING AND SPORTS PARTICIPATION- SO INTRODUCED. YOU AND EVEN ADULTS WHO HAVE NOT HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO HUNT AND FISH IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. DIRECT THEM TO THAT DEPARTMENT R. THREE INITIATIVES AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT IT STAKEHOLDERS FOCUSED ON. THERE WERE AND EIGHT STAKEHOLDERS- SUBCOMMITTEES AND IT WAS ADULT ONSET REACTIVATION AND HOUSTON FAMILIES MARKETING AND PUBLIC PERCEPTION LICENSE STRUCTURE ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY AND MENTORSHIP SO THAT MENTORSHIP IS VERY KEY KEY ELEMENTS BEGIN INTRODUCING. FOLKS IN THE LA AREA THAT HAVE NOT HAD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO. WE COME HERE AND GET OUT IN WILDLIFE AND ENJOYING MAYBE THROUGH A MENTORSHIP PROGRAM. THANK YOU MR MURRAY. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR SO I WOULD ECHO COMMISSIONER HOUSE APARTMENTS AND I ANSWER AND MAYBE JUST ADD A COUPLE POINTS TO IT YOU KNOW UNDER THE R. THREE WHICH AGAIN IS RECRUITMENT RETENTION AD REACTIVATION EFFORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS LAUNCHED AND IS A PART OF A NATIONWIDE EFFORT. THERE'S A REALLY THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THESE OPPORTUNITY BARRIERS RIGHT THAT WOULD THAT WE KNOW EXIST EVEN IF WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THEM RIGHT ACCESS TO LAND AND WATER- MAYBE NOT HAVING THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT TO GO FISHING MAYBE NOT UNDERSTANDING THE RULES OR HAVING THE TRAINING OR KNOWLEDGE OF FISHING AND HUNTING AS WELL AS THESE INCLUSIVITY BARRIERS RIGHT NOT EVERYBODY FEELS WELCOME IN THE OUTDOORS AND EVERYBODY FEELS WELCOME AND THAT THE SPORT OF FISHING OR HUNTING THAT EVERYBODY EVEN FEEL SAFE. DOING THOSE SPORTS- AND THAT COULD BE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND SOME OF THOSE COULD BE CULTURAL OR HISTORICAL TRAUMA- COULD BE LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR A LACK OF SIGNAGE SO THERE IS A AN ACTION PLAN IN A WORK PLAN UNDER THIS R. THREE- PACKAGE THAT YOU KNOW TALKS ABOUT THINGS LIKE EXPANDING FISHING IN THE CITY PROGRAMS INCREASING STOCKING BY IS- EXPANDING THIS FISHING PASSPORT PROGRAM WHICH- IS SORT OF A IT SAYS YOU'RE A HUNDRED AND- FIFTY FISH AND THEN YOU CAN BUT YOU CAN CATCH IN THE STATE IN HERE ALL THE PLACES TO FIND THEM AND YOU GET STAMPS- AND YOU'RE ABLE TO YOU KNOW THERE'S AN APP THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. AND YOU KNOW THE R. THREE EFFORT IN THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT FISHING PASSPORT EFFORT IN THE OUT BY IT I THINK TWENTY 5% THIS YEAR. JACKIE MAY. MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT- FOLKS ARE NEW TO OUR NEW TO FISHING AND HUNTING AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A BILL ABOUT- RELATED TO THIS THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE- DATE FISHING LICENSE THAT HAS. YOU KNOW IT WAS IT TOOK A WHILE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BUT EVENTUALLY IT DID AND IT PASSED SO NOW WHEN YOU BUY A FISHING LICENSE FOR YOUR- FIFTY TWO DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT IS. IF YOU BITE IN NOVEMBER IT DOESN'T EXPIRE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST IT DIDN'T EXPIRES IN TWELVE MONTHS SO YOU REALLY DO GET THAT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS OF FISHING. SOME UP AND RUNNING AND WE'RE WORKING ON IT NOW OR RATHER THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING ON THAT NOW. THAT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT IN MID TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND I THIK THAT'S ALSO REALLY VALUABLE FOR MAKING SURE FOLKS FEEL LIKE. THEY INVEST IN A FISHING LICENSE FEE OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS. SAID TO USE IT AND GET THEIR MONEY'S WORTH AND I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE A GOOD A GOOD- GOOD WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. THAT YOU MENTIONED AS WELL SENATOR. THANK YOU DOCTORS OF A LAUGH. YEAH THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT BECAUSE I WAS THAT URBAN KID WHO LOVED WILDLIFE AND DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS TO IT. I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO THIS ONE IS GETTING WILDLIFE INTO URBAN SPACES ANOTHER IS GETTING ESPECIALLY YOUTH BUT ALSO THEIR PARENTS ALSO ADULTS- OUT INTO PLACES WHERE THEY CAN HUNT AND FISH. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE OF THIS IS ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING AND PARTICIPATION IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS YEAH JUST. MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN CITIES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST URBAN STATE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT- THE NON URBAN AREAS AREN'T IMPORTANT I THINK IT JUST MEANS THAT. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WORK AND- MORE URGENT WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES AND KEEPING THEM CONNECTED TO LAND WATER AND WILDLIFE SO- I WAS VERY VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE ACTORS FOR ALL. AT NEWS THAT THERE'S SO MUCH FUNDING GOING INTO CREATING MORE GREEN SPACE AND PARKS IN URBAN AREAS AND PARTICULARLY WITH. REGARD TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES RECEIVING MORE OF THAT BENEFIT AND THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY- WILDLIFE FOLLOWS GREEN SPACE INTO CITIES AND BASS AT. YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE WHETHER WHAT YOU'RE RESTORING IS THE L. A. RIVER OR WHETHER IT'S NEW GREEN SPACE- YOU KNOW FOR ATHLETIC FIELDS AND SO ON. ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS IS. WHAT COMMISSIONERATE MENTIONED I WAS JUST READING ABOUT STOCKING I THINK IT WAS OF BROOK TROUT INTO- URBAN PONDS IN SACRAMENTO THAT. WAS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK- THAT'S HAPPENING AND THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO IT SO WE'RE BRINGING WILDLIFE INTO THE CITY'S OPPORTUNITIES INTO CITIES AND THEN I THINK WE ALSO REALLY WANT TO WORK TO SUPPORT MORE ACCESS THROUGH EFFORTS LIKE OUR THREE- RETREAT RETAIN REACTIVATE PROGRAM. WHAT THAT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE IS. ITS PARTNERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT IS COMMERCIAL FISHING BOAT OPERATORS VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME AND RESOURCES TO TAKE A GROUP OF KIDS OUT SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN TO FISH IN THE OCEAN AND THAT'S THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW CAN REALLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND- GET THEM HOOKED FOR LIFE. THE THIRD PIECE OF THAT IS ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING AND THAT JUSTICE EQUITY DIVERSITY INCLUSION PLAN. THAT WHEN I JOIN THE COMMISSION WAS SORT OF. GAINING STE. IS I AM PROUD TO SAY OUR STAFF TO SPEND MIRACULOUSLY- AT. AT INCLUSIVE- AND EFFECTIVE AT MOVING THAT FORWARD AND THAT REALLY ADDRESSES BOTH ACCESS TO NATURE AND ACCESS TO THIS WHOLE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE WENT REMOTE BUT OUR COMMISSION MEETINGS IS THAT WE REALIZED THAT MADE IT A LOT EASIER FOR MANY MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A TO TRAVEL AND TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK. SO I THINK THAT'S JUST ONE OTHER WAY THAT WE ARE REALLY WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT HUNTING AND FISHING AND ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS WILDLIFE FOR AVAILABLE TO MY FOLKS PARTICULARLY IN CITIES. YES THANK YOU I'M CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE GLENMORE LAKE ACTUALLY I CAN HAVE PARK IN LOS ANGELES AND THEY STOCK THAT QUITE REGULARLY IT IS A COUNTY PARK BUT JUST TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES COMMON. LEARN HOW TO FISH AND YOU SEE PARENTS SPENDING TIME WITH CHILDREN AND GRANDPARENTS SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN- YOU KNOW PROBABLY- TAKING PART IN THE TRADITION OF FAMILY TRADITION. I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT'S THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE. THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE- SUPPORTING. AS WERE CONNECTING FOLKS TO NATURE AND- YOU KNOW ACTIVITIES THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE OUTSIDE. EXTRATERRESTRIAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR- IT WHAT A WHAT A LIVELY DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF SOME THINGS THAT I AM LEARNING I WISH WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH URBAN COYOTES IN PARKS BUT I'LL I WILL I WILL GO THERE I WILL AT LEAST NOT RIGHT NOW I WILL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY OF VICE CHAIR BATES AND THEN OF COURSE TO SENATOR GROW SO- VICE CHAIR ARE YOU. THEYARE PREPARED TO ASK COMMENTS OR MAKE OUR MAKE COMMENTS OR ASK QUESTIONS I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE COMMENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS THIS SUB PANEL ARE PROBABLY HAVE GIVEN THE MOST IN DEPTH RESPONSES TO ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ON OUR REVIEW SHEETS AND A VERY VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THAT- MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ARE DOING WELL BECAUSE I HAVE A COASTAL DISTRICT AS YOU KNOW AND IT WAS A VERY VERY HOT TOPIC US SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND A LOT OF BY A LOT OF BY A ROUND TABLES AND- CITIZEN NO GROUPS AND FISHERMEN IN SEOUL- THOSE WHO HAVE OTHER COMMERCIAL FISHING BOATS AND CERTAINLY THOSE WHO HAVE COMMERCIAL PASSENGER FISHING BOATS ALL OF THAT WAS ON. THERE WAS A LOT OF THREATS ABOUT IT A LOT OF WORRY ABOUT THAT AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THINGS THAT REALLY HAVE FALLEN INTO PLACE AND ALL ASPECTS ABOUT ARE REALLY WORKING FULL THANK YOU ALL FOR A VERY IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND CERTAINLY I STANDING UP DURING THAT TIME TO CREATE THOSE IT WAS I KNOW IT'S NOT AN EASY ASSIGNMENT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE OF THE BEST OF WHAT WE HOPE FOR IS COMING TO THE FORE IN THAT'S GOING TO. BENEFIT EVERYBODY ALSO ON NOW I NOTICED A DOCTOR'S OFFICE I'M A LITTLE SAD ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL PASSENGER FISHING BOATS HAVING ACCESS FOR ALL THOSE WHO NEVER FISH THE OCEAN BEFORE- HOURS YOU PEOPLE LIVE IN THE URBAN CENTER SIDE THAT'S REALLY. GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S ANOTHER VERY CONTROVERSIAL AREA. IN TERMS OF THOSE PARTICULAR- PASSENGER FISHING BOATS THAT ARE UP AGAINST. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THEY NEED TO MAKE WITH. THE ADMISSIONS. AND CLIMB CHANGE IN ALL THAT SO KNOWING THAT WE HAVE A FIVE OF THAT REALLY ONE TO RETURN. OUR TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ENJOYING. OF BEING ON THE OCEAN AND WITH THEIR FISHING POLES IN THE OCEAN. AND ENJOYING ON THAT BILLS CREATURES OUT THERE IN THE IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WAYS YOU KNOW THEY DO A LOT OF B. R. WELL WATCHING IT YOU KNOW AND- WATCH THE- CORPUS- MIGRATION THE WILL MIGRATION ENOUGH THE PURPOSE IS ALL ABOUT AND IT'S ALL. POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE CERTAINLY ON WITH THE MANY OF YOU INVOLVED IN ALL OF THOSE ISSUES SO. I IDEA AND I WANT TO ASK BUT I THINK YOU DID ANSWER. ARE HOW ARE YOU YOU WANTED TO- IN WRITTEN RESPONSES THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING TO GET MORE STAKEHOLDERS. ARE INVOLVED- AND I THINK THAT YOU COVERED THAT VERY WELL IN A VARIETY OF YOUR COMMENTS SO. YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY- GRATITUDE FOR YOUR WILLING TO SERVE BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE- CONFRONTED WITH SOME. THE PUBLIC INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY- ARE NOT ALWAYS EASY TO EXPLAIN OF WHAT THE LONG TERM GOAL IS AND YOU'VE DONE THAT VERY WELL SO. THANK YOU ALL AND- LOOK FOWARD TO- NEEDS THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THEN. ON TO THE BALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VICE- SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU AND I DO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES S. COMMENTS THAT YOU GUYS DID PRIZEFIGHT SUCH AN EXTENSIVE RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AND THAT MAKES OUR JOBS I THINK A LOT EASIER WHEN IT'S IN WRITING AND WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION AND A HEAD OF TIME AND SO I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THOUGH. AND I DON'T MIND IF WE CONTINUE IN THE SAME ORDER THAT WE TOOK THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS I'LL ASK THE ONE QUESTION EACH OF YOU CAN ANSWER I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS I'M THE FIRST ONE IS WHEN SETTING HUNTING AND FISHING REGULATIONS HOW DO YOU. WAIT BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AGAINST AND ONE IS A NON SCIENTIFIC PUBLIC IMPACT ON YOUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE I KNOW AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DON'T WANT S. YOU KNOW INVADING ANIMAL HABITATS I GUESS I'M IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT. SO HOW DO YOU WEIGH AND THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE ON HUNTING AND FISHING REGULATIONS BASED ON SCIENCE AND NOT. AND WHAT COMES IN FROM NON SCIENTIFIC PUBLIC MEMBERS IF THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO I JACKAL HOSTILE HARMISON'S FIRST. I THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH FOR THE QUESTION NO- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME TO LOOK AT THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE TO INCORPORATE ANY ANY INFORMATION- ALSO TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM THE FROM THE TRIBES OF THE CULTURAL LEADERS. BUT I REALLY ALSO LOOK AT CITIZEN SCIENCE- YOU KNOW OUR FISHERMEN OUT HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE THE VERY BEST EFFORTS OUT THERE ON THE WATER AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEY IN FACT TO GET INVOLVED AND COLLECT DATA FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT TIMES SO FOR ME IT'S A ROBUST. OVERVIEW OF ALL ALL. PEOPLE ALSO ITEMS. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCIENCE AND THEN COMING UP WITH WHAT'S BEST FOR THE RESOURCE WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT- SPECIES. SO IT IS IT'S A MULTI FACETED DECISION WITH LOTS OF RESEARCH AND- TAKING THAT THE PUBLIC INPUT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT A LOT OF TIMES WE RECEIVED GREAT INFORMATION THE DAY OF THE MEETING ON THAT ITEM. SO THOSE THOSE ARE THE WAYS I'D I'D BALLOTS IT AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST AVAILABLE DECISION WITH SCIENCE BEING THAT THE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU- MISS MARIE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- I WISH THAT I HAD A SORT OF COOKIE CUTTER RESPONSE THAT WE APPLY IN EVERY CASE BUT IT FOR ME I'S NOT LIKE THAT RIGHT ITS CASE BY CASE WE TAKE THE SCIENCE ARE THERE ARE DECISIONS ARE DRIVEN BY SCIENCE AND THEY MUST ABSOLUTELY BE INFORMED BY SCIENCE. AND WE ALSO CARE ABOUT COMMUNITY IS RIGHT ESPECIALLY AS W ARE BUILDING OUT THIS JUSTICE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. I WORK PLAN AND POLICY AND ENVISION- WE YOU KNOW I DON'T I'LL SPEAK FOR ME PERSONALLY IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO REALLY. EARNESTLY BALANCE ARE DUAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF A HEALTHY BIODIVERSE AND NATURAL CALIFORNIA WHERE NATIVE FISH AND WILDLIFE THRIVE IN DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEMS WHILE ALSO INSPIRING HUMAN INTERACTION AND ENJOYMENT AND THAT INCLUDES NON CONSUMPTIVE AND CONSUMPTIVE RECREATION SO THOSE ARE TWO- TWO GOALSTHAT WE HAVE THAT THAT DO NOT ALWAYS SQUARE RIGHT AND SO IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO TAKE THE SCIENCE AND ACHIEVE THOSE TWO GOALS AND- THE WAY THAT WE DO IT IS WE READ THE PUBLIC COMMENTS YOU KNOW OUR BINDERS ARE SOMETIMES TWO THOUSAND PAGES GOING INTO A MEETING AND A LOT OF THAT IS IT'S STAFF MEMBERS BUT IT'S ALSO. SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND A LOT OF IT IS PUBLIC COMMENTS AND WE READ THOSE COMMENTS WE LISTEN- DURING MEETINGS I HAVE SEEN YOU KNOW TIMES WHERE WE AS A COMMISSION ARE ALL AGAIN SPEAK FOR MYSELF I GO INTO A MEETING THINKING MAYBE THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE OUTCOME AND THEN AFTER HEARING WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S A DIFFERENT OUTCOME- THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE COMPLETE DATA SETS RIGHT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ALL THE DATA THAT WE WISH THAT WE HAD. AND WE STILL NEED TO MAKE ART YOU KNOW A DECISION BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE THAT WE DO HAVE AND THE INTERESTS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THESE TWO IMPORTANT GOALS THAT WE HAVE- SOMETIMES WE GET LUCKY FOR EXAMPLE A COUPLE OF WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE WAS A PACIFIC HERRING FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN WERE STAKEHOLDERS BOTH FISHERMEN AND ENVIRONMENTAL NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS GOT TOGETHER AND SORT OF. CREATED A DRAFT AT THEM HE LARGELY FOR US RIGHT THAT'S WHEN WE GOT REALLY LUCKY AND WERE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING THAT THEY WORKED ON TOGETHER AND WE CAN APPROVE IT UNANIMOUSLY AND THEY DO SOME OF THAT WORK FOR US AND I DO THINK WE SEE THAT MORE AND MORE I THINK THE WAY THAT NATURAL RESOURCES POLICY AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN HAS CHANGED A LOT JUST IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. AND SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE GET VERY LUCKY- WHEN OF DOZENS KNOW WE'VE DO THE THAT WE CAN TAKE IN THE SCIENCE. TWO GOALS AND LISTENING TO THE FOLKS WHO COME IN AND TALK TO US. THANK YOU DOCTORS A LOT OF A LOT OF SORRY. THANKS WELL I'M A SCIENTIST SO I LIKE SCIENCE AS I THINK EVIDENCE AS YOU KNOW IT. IT'S NECESSARY BUT IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR DECISIONS TO BE SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT MISSIONARY JUST RAISED- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE SOMETIMES CAN CAN LAY SIDE OF IS THAT THE WAY THAT HUNTING AND FISHING OR SUSTAINS NOW IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SCIENCE BASED MODERN MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO WITH THE COMMISSION AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT. SO OF COURSE THE SCIENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS THAT OUR DECISIONS BE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE AND SOCIALLY- SUPPORTED. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THAT TO MISSION. AS A COMMISSION SO WE HAVE THIS DEAL MISSION TO PROMOTE INTO REGULATE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENJOY. THOSE INCLUDE HUNTING AND FISHING- AND TO PROTECT NATIVE WILDLIFE AND IN THE LONG RUN IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE MAYBE AND- AT. JUST ARTICULATED I THINK IN THE LONG TERM PROTECTING WILDLIFE REQUIRES SUSTAINING PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIPS TO IT SO. THOSE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALWAYS INCLUDED HUNTING AND FISHING SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE INCOMPLETE INFORMATION WE HAVE TO WEIGH. THE RISKS AND THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND AT ALLOWING HARDEST AGAINST THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY AROUND SEVERING PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE WILDLIFE THAT THEY HUNT AND FISH SO WE ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT THERE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD COME BACK TO IS THAT- HUNTING AND FISHING ARE. CORE PARTS OF WHAT WE SUPPORT AS ACT AS A COMMISSION AND SO THOSE TWO PIECES OF OUR MISSION GO TOGETHER WE NEED HEALTHY WILDLIFE POPULATIONS TO SUSTAIN US HUNTING AND FISHING OPPORTUNITIES AND WE NEED HUNTING AND FISHING TO SUSTAIN PEOPLE'S CONNECTIONS TO WILDLIFE MUCH AND THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS IN YOUR OPINION SHOULD THE COMMISSION'S REGULATORY PROCESSES SUPPORT GREATER FISHING AND HUNTING OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS- INCREASED A BAG LIMITS TAGS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IF THE SCIENCE IS THERE TO. AND SUPPORT IT. MYTHOS LEARN KARMA FINALLY JUST GO AHEAD AND START WITH YOU AGAIN WILL KEEP GOING IN THIS ORDER. YOU'RE DOING WELL AT IT YOU'RE DOING SO WELL I DON'T NEED TO. SAY ANYTHING. YOU KNOW- SENATOR GROSS I REALLY BELIEVE. THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES I THINK THE COMMISSION SHOULD SUPPORT- INCREASED BAG LIMIT. ON INCREASED OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR HUNTING AND ANGLING COMMUNITIES VERY DEFINITELY- EVERY EVERY DAY IN IN MY NORMAL DAY TO DAY JOB. I COME INTO CONTACT WITH FOLKS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REGULATION THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T GO OUT. AND FISH DURING CERTAIN TIMES OR WHY THE HELL OF IT SEASON HAS BEEN. CUT OFF IN AUGUST WHEN NORMALLY IN THE PAST AND IT WAS IN OCTOBER SO I ANSWERED THOSE QUESTIONS ON A DAILY BASIS AND I THINK WHEN THE SCIENCE ALLOWS. ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD BE. PROVIDING ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY- IF IT IS NOT THAT RISKS TO THE SPECIES I THINK THAT ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT IS IMPERATIVE. BUT ALSO THE REGARD. FOR THE HUMAN CONNECTION SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW FOR ME IT I SAID THIS IS A VERY LAWYER ANSWERED TO GIVE BUT I AM A LAWYER SO I HAD. PLANS RIGHT IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE SPECIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT JUST ACROSS THE BOARD YES ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW HIGHER BAG LIMITS MORE TAKE ON ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE YOU KNOW IT IS I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH WHAT- COMMISSIONERS OF A LOT OF SAD ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN- YOU KNOW ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY AND HOW THAT DOES FOSTER STEWARDSHIP. AND LONG TERM CONSERVATION AND THE INTER RELATEDNESS OF THOSE TWO THINGS YOU KNOW IF WE DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THRIVING WILDLIFE AND ECOSYSTEMS INTO THE INTO THE FUTURE AND THEN WE NO LONGER HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO HUNT AND FISH FOR THE SPECIES SO THEY ARE VERY MUCH INTER RELATED- I THINK IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASING DROUGHTS INCREASING WILDFIRES AND JUST THAT SORT OF SO MANY CHANGING SYSTEMS ALL THE TIME. I CAN SAY THAT I'M COMMITTED TO PRESERVING AND ENHANCING OPPORTUNITIES WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S GOING TO BE A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND IT'S VERY TRICKY TO JUST GIVE UP A BLANKET APPLICATION OF SAYING IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY HUNTERS AS WE DID IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND IT'S A CHALLENGE AND YOU KNOW THE R. THREE EFFORTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ARE REALLY AT FINDING WAYS TO ENGAGE NEW AUDIENCES INCLUDING YOUNG PEOPLE. IN HUNTING AND FISHING ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I REALLY D BELIEVE SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP FISHING YOU KNOW I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I GREW UP FISHING I'M THE SON OF A OF A OF A VERY COMMITTED HUNTER- AND I WAS JUST A YOU KNOW IT'S VERY MUCH WHY I DO WHAT I DO TODAY SO I SEE AND I VALUE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AND GETTING OUTSIDE HUNTING FISHING CONNECTING WITH THESE RESOURCES AND WANTING TO PROTECT THEM INTO THE FUTURE- AND SO. I AM. WANT THEIR CREATE ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN. THANK YOU. DOCTORS OF A LETTER. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT THE QUESTION SENATOR GROVE- I THINK THERE'S A LOT PACKED INTO THAT IF THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS IT RIGHT- A LOT THERE THAT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIES ON THE CONTEXT ON THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FACING POPULATIONS BUT IF THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS IT YES I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF OUR MISSION AND THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAN EVER PART OF OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HUNTING AND FISHING OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CAN'T REALLY DO THAT IF WE DON'T CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES SO- IF THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS THAT. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ISN'T ANY SORT OF HARM ANY RISK AND IN MOVING FORWARD I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- LAST WEEK I FACILITATED A COMMISSION WORKSHOP- ON BIG GAME HUNTING AND I WAS. I WAS DELIGHTED BY THE TURN OUT THERE'S A HUGE TURNOUT FROM ACROSS THE STTE AND- I THINK WHAT I WAS STRUCK BY THAT I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THEM AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT PEOPLE'S VIEWS IT WAS ALSO THERE ON THE GROUND OBSERVATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR WILDLIFE AND- IN LANDS AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTNERS WE THINKING HARD AND CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITY FOR SHIFT OPPORTUNITY- YOU KNOW IN THE NAME OF NOT JUST MORE ACCESSIBLE MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRESS THERE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE. THANK YOU AND MY LAST QUESTIONS YOU PLEASE ONE THE FIRST PART OF IT OR THE SECOND PART WILL JUST BE YES OR NO. I'M JUST CURIOUS AND- AND THEN THE FIRST PART IS AND- I HAVE A LAKE LIKE IS A BALLET IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY UP IN THE MOUNTAIN AREA. IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY AND IT RELIES ON FISHING GAME STOCKING UP LIKE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE TOURISM. FOR THE TOWN TO SURVIVE AND- THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS. THERE'S BEEN A DECREASE IN STOCKING WHO MAKES THE DECISION. ON WHAT KIND OF FISHER HOW FISH GET STOCKED IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE. AND IS THAT THE COMMISSION. AND CAN I REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY ABOUT STOCKING THAT OR FIGURING OUT WHY THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST VERSUS THE MIDDLE ARE TAUGHT. THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE LIKE WHO MAKES THAT DECISION I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS YOU GUYS OR- IT WAS THE COMMISSION FROM IS SOMEBODY ELSE IN THERE NOW AND- THE SECOND QUESTION JUST YES OR NO DO ANY OF YOU GUYS. ARE ALL OF YOU GUYS ARE ANY OF YOU HAD A AND DINNER FISHING LICENSE. THANK YOU ARE. START AGAIN AT THE TOP WITH- WITH JACQUELYN HOSLER COMMERCE ON AND GO DOWN THE LIST AND- THERE WERE TWO QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO ANSWER THE FIRST ONE BUT SHE CLEARLY WANTS AN ANSWER TO THAT YESTERDAY. HE GO. I BELIEVE USED REACH OUT TO DIRECTOR CHUCK BONHAM. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND HIS- ONE OF HIS CHIEF WILL WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE THEY DO LOOK AT NEEDS THEY THEY OOK AT. THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE ON HAND AND I THINK THEY THEY DO YOU HAVE A FORMULA TO DETERMINE I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT FORMULA IS. OKAY INDIA FISHING LICENSE I HAVE A QUESTION LICENSE. AND IF I COULD CIRCLE BACK I WANT TO STAY UP A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. THE- THE YES OR NO ANSWER ON SHOULD WE- VIBE MORE OPPORTUNITY IF THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS IT ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT IS TRIBAL PEOPLE IN THEIR IN THEIR LIFETIMES HAVE DONE MANAGEMENT. THROUGH KNOWING WHEN TO TAKE AND WHEN NOT TO CHECK THEY HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST RESOURCE MANAGERS OF ANY PEOPLE AND FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS IN HERE SO I BELIEVE LOOKING AT THAT TRADITIONAL SCIENCE AND GETTING THAT TRIBAL INPUT ON THAT SPECIES AND IF THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTENCE REALLY IMPORTANT SO I JUST WANTED TO CIRCLE BACK TO THAT. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU. MISS MERRY YES I DO HAVE A FISHING LICENSE I DO NOT HAVE A HUNTING LICENSE BUT I HAVE- STARTED THE HUNTER EDUCATION CLASS ONLINE IT'S ALL DONE ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT NOW NOT PRESENTLY DURING THIS HEARING BUT I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF IT- I RECENTLY AT MY DAD PASSED AWAY MANY YEARS AGO BUT HE DID LEAVE BEHIND- SOME TWELVE GAUGE SHOT GUNS AND RIFLES AND I RECENTLY YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE SOME OF THOSE AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF GOING OUT AND CARRYING ON A TRADITION- OF HIS AND OF YOU KNOW WHERE I'M FROM TO BE ABLE TO GO- AND- DO SOME SOME HUNTING AND COMMISSIONER. AND SKLAR AND I HAVE BEEN HATCHING A PLAN TO GET OUT TOGETHER HE YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF- PHEASANT AND DUCK HUNTING I THINK AS WELL AS- YEAH. WE'VE BEEN HAVING A TO GET OUT TOGETHER AND DO SOME HUNTING SO. THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF MY TWENTY TWENTY TWO CALLS. THANK YOU I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR DEATH. THANK YOU. FOR DOCTORS OF A LETTER IN HERE- I DON'T HAVE A HUNTING LICENSE I HAVE TAKEN CALIFORNIA CENTER EDUCATION CLASS- AND THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF WITHOUT GOING INTO ALL THE DETAILS I WILL JUST SAY THAT IS VERY MUCH ON MY BUCKET LIST FOR THIS YEAR AND THE PANDEMIC ACTUALLY FOR ME DELAYED. MY ABILITY TO GO DOWN THERE AND I HAVE A FISHING LICENSE AND- AND ACTUALLY OUT TRYING TO CALM MY NERVES FISHING THIS MORNING SO. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. I'M THAT WAY MY MAKE ONCE. JUST ON THE BASIC BUT I DO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU I AM REACHING BOTH SIDES REACHING THE PEOPLE THAT BRING YOU KNOW REACHING AND PEOPLE THAT IN URBAN AREAS THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FREE IN SPACE AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR HUNTERS ANGLERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SKILL AND THEN. YOU KNOW THEY FLY FRIED FISH RIGHT SO AND KEEP INTERESTS ARE AND ON THE SPECIES ACTUALLY STOPPED EATING GAPES AND THAT ALL YOU DO FOR THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AS WELL AND THAT THAT POPULATION OF OUR TRIBAL NATIONS SO THANK YOU. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR NOMINATION. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW- WELL AS IT IS ALL THE CASE WHEN YOU GO LAST THERE'S VERY. LITTLE LEFT TO COVER ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THIS IS SUCH AN EXPANSIVE- TOPIC OF ITEMS I COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING. I HOPE I'M NOT GONNA BE OFFENSIVE WHEN I SAY. THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE OUR GRANDFATHERS FISH AND GAME% COMMISSION I HAVE TO SAY AND I MEAN THAT WITH. GREAT RESPECT AND- PLEASURE ACTUALLY. I WAS GOING TO COMMENT ON WHAT- MISS HOSLER CONVERSE ON SANDWICHES. AS I HEARD SOMEONE TALK ABOUT SCIENCE BASED MODERN MANAGEMENT- BUT SOCIALLY SUPPORTED I ACTUALLY WAS THINKING BOY. I THINK THEY'VE BEEN- GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE THAT KNEW HOW TO DO THIS WITHOUT. THE MODERN DAY SCIENCE THAT WE SEEM TO TALK ABOUT SO I WHEN I WANT TO GIVE CREDENCE TO THAT- LIKE MS MURRAY I GREW UP IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. I SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA NOT WEST VIRGINIA- BUT I- YOU KNOW WHO GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF HUNTERS AND FISSURES AND MY BROTHER WHO LIVES IN NEW ENGLAND STILL DOES HAUNT FOR FOOD FOR HIS FAMILY AND- SO I HAVE AN APPRECIATION BUT I GUARANTEE YOU- SENATOR ROB I DO NOT HAVE A FISHING LICENSE. I HAVE STRAYED A BIT FOR MY ROOTS BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE DIVERSITY AND THE IMPORTANCE AND THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. OF WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST IN MODERN DAY CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT REGULATIONS RULES AND- AND HOW WE ADDRESS OUR DIVERSE POPULATIONS. WITHIN YOU KNOW I HAVE A REAL SIMPLE QUESTION IT'S NOT A YES OR NO HUNTING FISHING LICENSE QUESTION ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE TO KNOW THOSE THINGS. I CAN ALWAYS COUNT SENATOR GROVE TO GET RIGHT TO THE HEART OF SOMETHING. IMPORTANT YET SEEMINGLY SIMPLE. IT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE WHOLE. JERRY PLAN AND- YOU KNOW THE FOCUS AND THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US TODAY WHICH I SO APPRECIATE I PULLED OUT SOME REAL GEMS FROM THE CONVERSATION EACH OF YOU ADDED TO. WHAT ARE REALLY THE BEST WAYS TO ENGAGE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATIONS THE HEARINGS AND- DOCTORS OF A LETTER MENTIONED THE FORM THAT SHE GOT TO OVERSEE AND HOW PLEASED SHE WAS TO SEE THE- THE EX THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS CONVERSATION- S. AS THE MEANS TO REALLY ENGAGE AS YOU CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AS THINGS CHANGE WHEN YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THE BALANCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW- SPECIES POPULATIONS MAKING SURE THERE ARE THERE'S THE BALANCE BETWEEN. ACCESS TO HUNT OR FISH AND THE POPULATION SO HOW DO WE ENGAGE JUST A SIMPLE THING. FROM EACH OF YOU ARE ARE NOT EVERYONE HAS TO ANSWER BUT I JUST THINK THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH EACH OF YOUR- RESUMES IN YOUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE YOU EACH BRING YET WHEN YOU ALL SPOKE. YOU REALLY CREATED- QUITE A MOSAIC OF WHAT WE'RE- DEALING WITH IN CALIFORNIA IN A CHANGING. CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF IRVINE VERSUS WORLD SO. ON MYTHOS WE'RE GOOD KARMA SOME YOU WANT TO START AND ADD ANYTHING. THERE ARE YOU KNOW THOSE WHERE I BEGAN EIGHT YEARS AGO I WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW TO GET TRIBES TO THE TABLE BECAUSE MY FAMILY ARE NATIVE AMERICAN I WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO THATAND I. SAW EARLY ON THAT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THEIR VOICES TO BE HEARD. AND SO. WERE IN ONE OF THE EARLY MEETINGS I HAD A TRIBAL LEADER CATCH ME IN THE HALLWAY AND SAID WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO. GET THE FOR THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION OR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE THESE ISSUES ON ABALONE. SO I WAS ABLE TO DURING THAT MEETING- TALK TO THE AT THAT TIME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SONG CAME OUT STRONG. AND I SENT SOME CAN JUST PERSON REALLY NEEDS SOME HELP REALLY NEEDS SOME TIME. AND I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM IN THE ROOM AND MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS. THERE IS CREATING THE SPACE CREATING THE FORUM LISTENING AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED BY THE RULES AND THE REGULATIONS THERE AND- IT IS- BY THE PROCESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE RULE MAKING CALENDAR. IT'S AMAZING IT'S VERY CONFUSING AT TIMES SO I THINK HAVING THOSE. WORKSHOPS THOSE WEBINARS THOSE IN PERSON MEETINGS- THE COMMISSION IS WORKING ON. FISHING OUT. OTHERSSO MANY GREAT WAY JUST IN THE LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE EXPANDED THAT AND THROUGH OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING WE NEED TO DO MORE SO I THINK THOSE PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS ONE ON ONE. BRINGING THEM INTO THE MEETING PROCESS AND THEN DOING A FOLLOW UPS AFTERWARDS IS WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND. THANK YOU MISS MARIE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO I THINK IN TERMS OF ACCESS AND RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW DO WE GET FOLKS INVOLVED IN OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS. YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY AWARE OF US AND THEN THERE ARE THERE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT WHO MAYBE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF US RIGHT IT SEEMS. NOW HAVING GONE TO. A DECADE EVERY MONTH A FISHING GAME COMMISSION MEETINGS BEFORE EVER WAS ON THE COMMISSION IT SEEMS YOU KNOW UNBELIEVABLE TO THINK THAT WE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AN OBSCURE BODY TO SOME FOLKS BUT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE DO. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE SO FOR THE FOLKS WHO ALREADY ARE AWARE OF US- HAVING THE MEETINGS HAS ABSOLUTELY ENHANCED ACCESS TO OUR PROCESS AND OUR DECISION MAKING- FOLKS CAN JOIN ON ZOOM. EVEN WHEN WE GO BACK IN PERSON WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- PRESERVING SOME KIND OF HYBRID APPROACH WHERE FOLKS CAN STILL JOIN ON pOUR MEETINGS WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW JUSTICE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IT'S A STANDING AGENDA ITEM- THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT. REALLY AT EVERY MEETING AND SO WE NOW HAVE CREATED A VISION THAT'S BOTH ABOUT SAFE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. AND INCLUSIVE DECISION MAKING THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS AND VALUES OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THOSE TWO SORT OF IMPORTANT CATEGORIES. JUST GETTING FOLKS COMFORTABLE HEARING A COMMISSION LIKE OURS THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD- AND AS YOU MENTIONED MATTER PRO TIME HAS NOT ALWAYS LOOKS THE WY IT LOOKS NOW. JUST GETTING FOLKS COME THROUGH WITH THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND CREATING A WORK PLAN AND A POLICY THAT WE CAN SORT OF. STAYED TRUE TO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR DECISION MAKING I THINK THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL AND IT'S A BIG CHANGE JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT'S REALLY GETTING NOTICE. IN TERMS OF REACHING FOLKS WHO ARE NOT ALREADY IN THE ROOM- WE HAVE BEEN FORGING NEW PARTNERSHIPS YOU KNOW I'LL SAY THAT HAVING OUR NEW TRAVEL ADVISOR ON BOARD. HAS BANNED I CAN SEE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE IT ALREADY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL AND HE'S NOT EVEN BEEN THERE A YEAR- SO HAVING. ENHANCED CONNECTION AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE TO BUILD ON WHAT COMMISSIONER ALSO KARMAZIN IS ALREADY VERY IMPACT FULLY DONE- IS JUST REALLY POWERFUL- HAVING. NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOLKS LIKE HISPANIC ACCESS FOUNDATION LATINO OUTDOORS NETWORK OUTDOOR AFRO BROWN GIRL SURF- AND ANOTHER SORT OF IDENTITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CONSERVATION AND GETTING OUTDOORS. I THINK IS ALSO REALLY POWERFUL AND HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE BARRIERS FOR WHY PEOPLE DON'T ENGAGE IN OUR PROCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT I AM A WHITE WOMAN- WHO SITS ON THIS COMMISSION AND HAS MY OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE AND SO I CAN'T PRETEND TO GUESS WHAT SOME OF THE BARRIERS ARE BUT- CONNECTING TO NEW KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE NOT ALREADY WELL CONNECTED TO. WE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIALLY SENDING OUT A SURVEY BROADLY I TO SORT OF GAUGE AWARENESS OF OUR BODY AND WHAT WE DO AND SEE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO IN FOR FOLKS TO WANT TO ENGAGE WITH US A LITTLE BIT MORE I THINK THAT'S AN IDEA AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME OF OUR CHEN I WORKSHOPS AFTER HOURS RIGHT SO. A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK AND ARE NOT ABLE TO COME TO OUR ALL DAY LONG TO DAY FISH AND GAME COMMISSION MEETINGS SO HAVING DEDICATED WORKSHOPS TALKS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT CHEN I PRINCIPLES. FROM FOUR TO SIX OR FIVE TO SEVEN IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE TO TRY TO REACH NEW FOLKS. SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE IDEAS WE THOUGHT TAKEN TOGETHER WITH- SOME OF THE R. THREE- ACTION ITEMS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE I WERE HOPING THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A JOURNEY I DON'T THINK THE AND PLANES IS GOING TO BE ANY TIME SOON. BUT JUST NORMALIZING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EQUITY AND JUSTICE AND INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STAFF AND THESE NEW PARTNERSHIPS AS WELL. I'M AS WE GO TO A DOCTOR'S OF A LETTER I JUST HAVE TO SAY I AM NOT SURE. THE PER DIEM YOU GET FOR THIS IS. A NOT FIT ALL IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL. BASED ON WHAT YOU EACH ARE SHARING WITH US TODAY- DOCTORS OF THE LEAD I WANT TO CLOSE THIS OUT. THANK YOU AND MAYBE I'LL START BY RECOGNIZING THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT OUR STAFF DOES AND HOW MUCH I APPRECIATED THAT AND MY FIRST. TEN MONTHS ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE- THEY MAKE POSSIBLE. ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AND I WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT. AND I GUESS WHAT I CAN SAY THERE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT I THINK ABOUT SCIENCE IS A PROCESS I DID A PROCESS ON A BODY OF FACTS AND SO. WHAT IS THAT PROCESS IT'S TAKING OBSERVATIONS THAT'S TAKING DATA. IT'S TAKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANDSCAPE AND THEN APPLYING IT TO UNDERSTANDING JUST. QUESTIONS LIKE. WHERE THE ANIMALS AND HOW MANY ARE THERE AND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM AND SO- WHEN I THINK OF SCIENCE I THINK OF SORT OF THE BEST VERSION OF THAT AS THE INTERGENERATIONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT. ARE AT PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES BRING TO THE TABLE I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND UNDER RECOGNIZED SOURCES OF INFORMATION. TO FOR US TO USE TECH GUIDE OUR DECISION MAKING AND SO- REALLY REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORT- WHAT YOU SAID AND I THINK IT- THAT'S KIND OF THE NEXT. PHASE FOR US IS- DICTATE. LOOK BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN. SETTING ASIDE AND IGNORING CALIFORNIANS I'M A TRY TO BE BRIEF I THINK THAT THAT. IS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WE ALL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER TO IS TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS MISSING- WHO IS NOT IN THIS CONVERSATION WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHERE THEY LOOK LIKE- I WAS DOWN ON THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE IT OUTLINES THE FISHING LAST WEEKEND AND- I REALIZE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. ANY OF THE LATINO FAMILIES WHO. PULLED UP AND ARE FISHING UP THERE ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND I SHOULD I WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE SO. UNDERSTANDING IS MISSING AND THEN LISTENING- BEFORE I BECAME SORT OF A CARD CARRYING ECOLOGIST I WAS A SOCIAL SCIENTIST AND REALLY THAT IS ALL ABOUT LISTENING THAT'S REALLY THE SCALE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CULTIVATE AND- SO LISTENING IN OUR MEETINGS. BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS IN BED MANY WAYS THAT- MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS. TALKED ABOUT IS REALLY PARAMOUNT AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S IN THE FIELD IT'S ALSO BY OUR PARTNERS- WE HAVE A GREAT MANY PARTNERS IN THE DEPARTMENT- IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO CAN DO SOME OF THAT LISTENING FOR US. AND HELP US REACH SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WE DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY KNOW ARE MISSING FROM THE CONVERSATION. AT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO REACH OUT AND- I THINK ONCE WE GET BACK TO IN PERSON MEETINGS WITH THIS SORT OF HYBRID OPTIONS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE. WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL AND MISS WORK. BUT ALSO WE CAN BE IN A PLACE AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE MORE DEEPLY WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT PLACE- YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP. AND PERSONALLY I HAVEN'T BEEN TO AN IN PERSON MEETING AT THAT'S GOING TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND AND LISTEN TO AND- SORT OF ENGAGING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THAT ARE GOING TO BRING. MORE OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT SENATOR COM LOGGERS AT BUDGET SUB FIVE RIGHT NOW BUT- SHE MAY HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING TO FUND ENFORCEMENT PIECES OF WHAT YOU DO SO- BUT I'M SORRY SHE MISSED THIS THESE LAST FEW- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE SHE STARTED IN. HER QUESIONING IN TERMS OF- THE DIVERSITY. BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR THOSE INCREDIBLE. COMMENTS AND HELPING US TO LEARN SOME THINGS AND THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR RECOGNIZE AND STAFF- YOU COULDN'T DO WHAT YOU DO WITHOUT. THEIR INVOLVEMENT SO I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT RECOGNITION. WE ARE ALL RIGHT NOW- AFTER A REALLY EXPENSIVE WONDERFUL CONVERSATION- SENATOR LAYERED IS BACK FROM PRESENTING HIS BILL SO- WE'RE SORRY YOU MISSED SOME OF THE GREAT CONVERSATION BUT AS FORMER SECRETARY. OF NATURAL RESOURCES I'M SURE YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES BETTER THAN MOST OF US. OUT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PUBLIC I AND HEAR FROM THEM% BEFORE I COME BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES. FOR ABOUT A MOTION I'M GONNA DO A REMINDER BEFORE I START WITH THE- THOSE PRESENT HERE WHO MAY WISH TO SPEAK. A REMINDER- THAT WE HAVE A TOLL FREE NUMBER WHEN WE GO TO THE TELECONFERENCE. AND I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE PUT THAT ON THE SCREEN AGAIN IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. BUT THE NUMBER IS. AND ACCESS CODE IS FOUR SEVEN NINE FOUR ONE ONE. AND WITH THAT I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP HERE IN ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE TO SEE IF WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK. AND WE DO. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW EXCITED WE ARE TO SEE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN PERSON- WELCOME AND IF YOU COULD GIVE ME YOUR NAME AT ANY ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT IF ANY AND THEN YOUR COMMENTS WELCOME. HOW TO- TOM RATIGAN WITH THE SPORTFISHING CONSERVANCY AND WE ARE KIND OF HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE ROOM TO HELP WILL HOPEFULLY THIS IS A CHANGES AND MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO COME UP HERE. AND SPEAK I DON'T KNOW DOCTORS AVALARA AND HAVEN'T WORKED WITH HER BUT WITH- COMMISSIONER HAROLD HARMISON. KARMAZIN COMMISSIONER MURRAY OF I'VE WORKED WITH BOTH OF THEM FOR YEARS AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THAT- THEY DO THEIR HOMEWORK WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY VERY COMPLEX ISSUES. WILL GO EVERYTHING FROM FERRETS TO MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND IT'S A WIDE RANGE AND- I CAN NEVER REMEMBER BEING IN A FISHING GAME COMMISSION. WHEN THEY WERE NOT DOING THEIR HOMEWORK AND DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING. NUMBER TWO THEY LISTEN WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE. AND THEY TAKE THIS AND THEY TAKE IT ALL IN AND THEY WHERE. AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY. IN EACH AND EVERY INSTANCE WE COME OUT WITH A FAIR DECISION. IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE THINGS THAT THE OUTDOOR COMMUNITY WANTS IT MAY NOT BE THE HINGS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY WANTS. BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD BALANCE IN BETWEEN AND I COULD NOT GIVE A HIGHER RECOMMENDATION THAN THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR COMING HERE TO GIVE IT- ANYONE ELSE IN ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE. OKAY SEEING NO ONE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- OUR TELECONFERENCE AND WE WILL FIRST TAKE- INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND WITH THAT- LET ME WELCOME OUR MODERATOR WHO WILL FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION TODAY VIA A TELECONFERENCE WELCOME. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND AS WE WAIT FOR THEM TO TEE UP I'M JUST GOING TO REMIND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CALLING IN THAT WE NEED YOUR NAME. ORGANIZATION IF ANY AND POSITION ON THE APPOINTMENT AND AGAIN SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY SO WE CAN GET YOUR TESTIMONY GO AHEAD MADAM MODERATOR. THANK YOU I HAVE ABOUT SEVEN Q. LINE EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON HEARING YES WE CAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN THIS IS A REALLY GRIFFITH ON THE HAPPY CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WE'RE CALLING IN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ALL THREE OF THESE CANDIDATES AUTHORITIES IN THE VISUAL THE YOU HEARD ECHOED MANY TIMES ON THE IN THE TESTIMONY THEY BASE YOUR DECISIONS ON SCIENCE AND WE CAN'T ASK FOR MUCH MORE THAN THAT SECONDLY AS WAS JST PREVIOUSLY STATED THE SENSIBILITY.

FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE BY TELECONFERENCE- AND REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION GO AHEAD. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AT THE END OF THE ROW AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. MAN MODERATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL TALK WITH YOU A LITTLE LATER IN THE HEARING APPRECIATE YOUR HELP I AND BEFORE I TAKE IN MOTION AND I AM READY TO GO TO YOU I JUST WANT TO DEFEND MY GRANDFATHER'S BECAUSE I KNEW I'D GET IN TROUBLE ON THAT STATEMENT. BOTH GREAT HUNTERS BOTH GREAT FARMERS AND WITH THAT I'M STILL APPRECIATIVE OF THE FISHING GAME COMMISSIONERS BEFORE US SENATOR LAYERED I ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE THE UNUSUAL. STEP OF MAKING A COMMENT BEFORE MOTION PLAN DO AND I TOO ENJOYED- THE- KATHY WHICH IS COMMON ABOUT THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S RULES COMMITTEE AS WELL. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT R. ONE RANDOM COMMENT FIRST JUST THE REASON THIS IS THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT TEN YEARS AGO BECAME THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT IS THE NAME OF THE COMMISSION IS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION SO WE COULD CHANGE THE NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SOME OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO HAVE THE NAME OF THE COMMISSION FALLS SO HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WITH THOSE OF US AROUND THIS TABLE BEING HERE WE CAN FIND A PLACE WHERE THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT THE COMMENT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. ON MY VERY FIRST DAY AS RESOURCES SECRETARY I GOT A CALL FROM A STATE SENATOR. WEST BROKE. WHO CALLED AND SAID I WANT TO INTRODUCE A BILL. THAT REALLY REMOVES TRIBES FROM THE MARINE PROTECTED AREA PROCESS. AND AFTER GAUGING WITH HIM FOR A FEW DAYS I SAID I KNOW HOW ARE YOU MEANT IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU DON'T HAVE DEMAND THE GUTS OF THE BILL AND UNTIL APRIL. WOULD YOU GIVE ME TELL APRIL TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TRIBES AND SEE IF I CAN FIND. AN ADEQUATE SOLUTION. AND SO I DID IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BLUE OP ARE ONCE. BUT WE GOT TO A LANDMARK AGREEMENT THAT SAID. THAT IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS IN THE CONSERVATION AREAS OF THE TRIBE CAN. DEMONSTRATE A HISTORIC TAKE FOR SUBSISTENCE FOR CEREMONIAL PURPOSES THEY CAN DO THAT IN THE CONSERVATION AREA. AND IT TOOK TRIBES ONCE THE COMMISSION APPROVED IT FROM OPPOSITION TO MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. TO SUPPORT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP IN THAT PROCESS. WAS A TRIBAL. OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FEELING WHAT THEY WANT REPRESENTED ON THIS COMMISSION THAT THEY WERE NOT WITHIN IT AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST APPOINTMENT STUFF WAS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OF WAS JACQUI HOSLER KARMA'S. AND I THINK THAT TODAY'S TESTIMONY IS A TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT SHE LIVED UP TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS THE REASON THAT WE WANTED HER ON THE COMMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE THE FACT THAT IMMEDIATELY. A TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVE OR STOP IN THE HALLWAY AND SAY HOW DO I INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM. AND WE HAD TO FLUSH OUT THINGS OVER TIME THAT WERE IN THAT AGREEMENT SUCH AS WHAT IS SUBSISTENCE WERE NOW ON THE COMMISSION HE'S WORKING ON THE DEFINITION OF SUBSISTENCE. AND TRIBES ARE UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCES I BELIEVE THAT THE TRINIDAD RANCHERIA WERE JACQUI WORKS. IS ONE THAT HAS ITS OWN FAULTS AND SO THEY WANTED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENFORCE JOINT AND POWER JACKIE IS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DISCUSSION ON A POTENTIAL AGREEMENT ON WHAT CO MANAGEMENT REALLY IS TO REPRESENT THE ASSETS THAT COME FROM THE TRIBES. AND PUT THEM WITH OF THE ASSETS OF THE STATE AND IN A COOPERATIVE WAY MOVE AHEAD ON MARINE PROTECTION. AND SO IT IS AN AMAZING THING AND SAMANTHA MARIE WAS AT ALMOST ALL THOSE MEETINGS ADVOCATING AND ERICA- SUMMER WEATHER IS A SCIENTIST AND NOW IN THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT I DEBATED SAYING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW IT MIGHT BE CONTROVERSIAL. AMONG CERTAIN PARTIES THERE ARE MORE SCIENTISTS THAN THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT DOWN THERE ARE WARDENS OR WILDLIFE OFFICERS AND IT'S BECAUSE AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID. THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO SCIENCE. AND SO WHEN VACANCIES ON THIS COMMISSION CAME UP TEN AND TWELVE YEARS AGO. ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING THINGS AS THE WITNESSES WE JUST HAD WILL PROBABLY SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE ON THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND SO HERE WE ARE TODAY. WITH THREE COMMISSIONERS WITH A DIVERSE BACKGROUND. THAT REALLY HAVE HAD PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE COMMISSION. THAT HAD UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AMONG THE WITNESSES. FROM PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T AGREE ON COME MISSIONERS IN THE POINT. SO I THINK THIS IS JUST AN AMAZING STEP FORWARD IT'S AMAZING TRIBUTE TO WHERE THE COMMISSION IS NOW. AND THE FACT THAT IT'S RESPONSIVE AND SCIENCE BASED PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT TIPS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. ABOUT THAT PEOPLE FEEL REPRESENTED THAT IF YOUR TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVE YOU SEE YOURSELF ON THE DIESS IF YOU GO TO A MEETING SO- IT'S JUST WITH GREAT PLEASURE GREAT PRIDE THAT I MOVED THE CONFIRMATION OF THESE THREE POINT. SENATOR THANK YOU LET ME DO ONE TECHNICAL THING I'M LOOKING AT MY COLLEAGUES AND WE DO NOT NEED TO SPLIT THE MOTION ONE MOTION FOR THREE IS GOOD FOR ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES. OKAY THANK YOU I'M- SENATOR LEVIN I DON'T USUALLY SAY ANYTHING BEFORE WE VOTE AFTER THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE BUT LET ME JUST EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO YOU AND IN YOUR FORMER ROLE R. AS SECRETARY AND TO EACH OF THESE FOLKS WHO WERE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION WHICH OBVIOUSLY MADE THIS HEARING TODAY MUCH MORE OF A- EASY- APPOINTMENT PROCESS FOR ALL OF US ON ON THE COMMITTEE I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS SO I.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS MONTGOMERY AND I'M APPEARING BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A DIRECTOR OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY FOR ALL THE SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE TO ME THROUGHOUT MY CAREER ESPECIALLY NOW THROUGH THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR POINTING ME TO THIS POSITION AND THE CDC OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE IN ME AND MY EIS TEAM FOR THEIR SUPPORT HARD WORK AND THEIR DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT TO THE CITY FOUNDATION. PRIOR TO CDCR I WORKED AS A PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I JOIN STATE ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO I CALPERS AS CONTROLLER OVER ACCOUNTING TREASURY MANAGEMENT. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SEE OUR DOCTOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES. AND THE TOOLS BOTH STAFF AND THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS. AS A DIRECTOR OF THE I. S. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SPRINGS TECHNOLOGY THIS FORCED TO WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT. WHILE I DO NOT SET THE POLICY GOALS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE PROGRAM AREAS TO ENSURE WE'RE MEETING THE GOALS AND OUTCOMES. I BELIEVE MY BACKGROUND IN BUSINESS AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT ARE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE DEPARTMENT. AS A CONTINUES AS PER REMOTE WORK COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE R. CARSON AT PARKS RATED AND THEIR LOVED ONES AND OTHER NEW PROJECTS. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND SUPPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND WORKING WITH MY TEAM TO LEAD THEM TO SUCCESS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR. TO PEER BEFORE ALL OF YOU TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR COME LONGER YOU WANNA KICK A SAUCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- Q. HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR HOW YOU WANT US TO ASK QUESTIONS WITH TO WHOM I OF I THANK YOU FOR- SAYING THAT I SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP ON THAT. REALIZE AND MOVING FROM THE COMMISSIONERS OR THE GAME WHO ARE ALL THE SAME POSITION- IF YOU WILL DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO EACH INDIVIDUAL- BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT POSITIONS I RECOGNIZE THAT SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR THAT INSTRUCTION I WILL- START WITH MISS LOPEZ I WANT TO THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU- FOR GRANTING ME A FEW MINUTES YESTERDAY TO- OR MONDAY I CAN'T REMEMBER TO- TALK WITH YOU ABOUT YOUR WORK SO. I WILL ONLY ASK ONE QUESTION OF EACH OF YOU. BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A SOME GOOD TIME- MISS LOPEZ I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU. THE QUESTION ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW WE HAD A NICE DISCUSSION ABOUT- BULLYING INTIMIDATION- OF STRESS ANXIETY WITH THE STAFF- AND- SUICIDE RATES- WITH THE STAFF- INSIDE- CDCR. AND WE TALKED ABOUT TRAINING AND OBVIOUSLY. MORE MONEY AND RESOURCES AND I THINK WE BOTH AGREE THAT. YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE ISSUES ISN'T ALWAYS MORE MONEY OR MORE TRAINING- I'M BUT HOW DO WE SUPPORT. FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING WITHIN CDC ARE SO THAT THEY FEEL SUPPORTED THEY FEEL SAFE- WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO REGISTER LEVELS OF ANXIETY OR FEAR OR STRESS OR DEPRESSION WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION THAT PEOPLE CAN FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO RAISE ISSUES OF CONCERN. WITHOUT FEELING LIKE THERE WILL BE RETALIATION AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE PREVENT- HOW DO WE CREATE A CULTURE WHERE FOLKS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN WORK- AND WE DON'T END UP HEARING ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN WHO- ARE TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES- BECAUSE OF. YOU KNOW THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITHIN THE DIFFERENT PRISONS- YOU KNOW AS A ROLE RESULT OF THE CULTURE SO I'D LOVE IT IF YOU COULD JUST SORT OF. RESPOND TO THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR ABSOLUTELY- SO WITH. AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING I'VE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS I THINK I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGE- EVEN WITH THAT OUR CULTURE AS WELL- I THINK THAT WHAT COMES. WHAT REALLY IS- COMES TO MIND IS THE LEADERSHIP MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE- COMMITTED TO MAKING CHANGES OR COMMITTED TO LISTENING TO WHAT IS GOING ON. WHAT I FOUND MOST USEFUL WAS GOING OUT TO THE INSTITUTIONS MEETING WITH THE STAFF AND TALKING TO THEM AND SEEING WHAT CAN WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP WITH THIS CHANGE. AND GAINING THE TRUST OF OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT NOT ALL- EVERYBODY IS BEING LISTENED TO IN SOME REGARDS BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING SOMETIMES REALLY QUICKLY AND THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO AS LEADERS TO ENSURE THAT THE MESSAGING. IS REACHING ALL OF OUR SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND OUR STOP IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE EDUCATING OUR STOCK ALSO ON THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND WHAT AVENUES THERE ARE FOR THEM TO TAKE IF THEY FEEL. THAT THEY NEED TO- YOU TAKE IT TO THAT LEVEL BUT AGAIN I THINK THE IT GETS BACK TO THE COMMUNICATION AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IN. COMMUNICATION WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK EVERY DAY WE SHOULD BE MAKING THE DECISIONS JUST BASED ON SITTING IN OUR OFFICES WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT THERE LISTENING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO ADDRESS AND WHEN WE DO NOT PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE ALL THOSE THINGS. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TRADING AS WELL. I ALWAYS USE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME IN TRAINING AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE THROW TRAINING OUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE LET'S JUST TRAIN PEOPLE BUT THERE HAS TO BE MORE TO JUST THE TRAINING PIECE. I THINK TRAINING IS VERY CRITICAL AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES AGAIN. AND EDUCATION OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND FOR US YOU CAN DO COMING. EFFECTIVELY YOU KNOW FROM OUR POSITIONS IT AS THE LEADERS. SO I DEFINITELY THINK THAT SOMETHING WALKEN'S WE'VE I DON'T THINK SORRY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO- AS MOVING FORWARD BUT I WILL SAY. THAT I DO SEE A LOT OF PROGRESS OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. AND THAT GIVES ME- THANK AS WE HOPE AS WELL THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU FOR THAT M. AND I THINK GIVEN THE FACT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT NON CUSTODIAL STAFF RIGHT HOW WE CAN RETAIN RECRUIT AND RETAIN FOLKS YOU KNOW AS COOKS AND JANITORS AN ADMIN YOU KNOW THAT BEING ABLE TO RETAIN RECRUIT AND RETAIN THOSE POSITIONS. ARE SUCCESSFULLY WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON THE CUSTODIAL STAFF RIGHT IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY FEEL- SUPPORTED AND PROTECTED- YOU KNOW IT SORT OF GOES BOTH WAYS SO I KNOW WHAT I'M NOT GONNA ASK ABOUT THE OTHER ONE BUT- IT'S THE CYCLE OF LIFE. I'M MISS MONTGOMERY I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON A DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD- THE OTHER DAY AS WELL I THINK I'D ASK YOU ABOUT. CBSA THE COMPUTER VOICE STRESS ANALYZER- AND SO THE CLARIFICATION THAT I GOT IS THAT CVS SAY IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THREAT ASSESSMENTS IN OUR INSTITUTIONS- IT'S SO IT'S BEING UTILIZED. ARM AND I KNOW YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THAT YOU DON'T CREATE THE POLICY BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY IMPLEMENTING OPERATIONAL ISING IT AND I DO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE- BUT GIVEN THAT. CVS SAY- TENDS TO PRODUCE FALSE OR COMPROMISE REPORTS IT HAS AN ACCURACY RATE OF ABOUT 8% YOU KNOW I'M WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON. WHY WE ARE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES THERE ARE FOR US. TO GET THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE NEED- INFORMATION THAT WILL BE MORE ACCURATE AND CAN PASSED STRESS TESTS. WHEN IT COMES TO BEING CREDIBLE. BECAUSE I THINK 8% ACCURACY IS KIND OF LOW. THANK SENATOR- IS AS AS I DISCUSSES ACTUALLY- FALLS OUT OF FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF MY ROLE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AND I CAN CERTAINLY PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION- IT AS A- TALK ABOUT SHOULD SHOULD THE PROGRAM NEEDS THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT WE REALLY DO IS LOOK AT WITH THAT WORK WITH THE PROGRAMS TO- GET THE LOOK AT THE PROCUREMENT TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM ON IMPLEMENTING THE TECHNOLOGY BASED ON THE POLICY BASED ON THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT ANY PROCEDURES DIVIDE. DEFINED BY THEM- SO- WITH THAT- I CAN CERTAINLY PUT THEM IN TOUCH WITH SOMEBODY IN TOUCH WITH YOU TO THAT QUESTION. WELL THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT I GUESS IF THE IDEA IS TO. BE ABLE TO. ASSESS THREATS. WHICH IS A POLICY HOW DO WE DO THIS THEN SOMEONE MADE A DECISION TO PROCURE THIS KIND OF SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT. AND WHO'S THE ONE WHO SAYS HEY PEOPLE. WE DON'T GET GREAT RESULTS LET'S NOT- YOU KNOW IMPLEMENT THIS I MEAN THAT'S HOW I GET OF ADS AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. IF THAT'S NOT YOU I GUESS WHO IS IT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO BE IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE THAT COSTS A LOT THAT ISN'T PRODUCING THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO GET IN ULTIMATELY THE RESULTS WE WANT TO GET. ARE ACCURATE RESULTS. YOU MIGHT MATH YES THE AND AGAIN I THINK- I WOULD LOOK TO MAKE THE PROGRAM AREAS TO ANSWER THAT TYPE OF QUESTION I THINK THERE ARE- PEOPLE ARE- PROGRAM AREAS YOU JERK DIFFERENT TOOLS AND I THINK THAT THEY CAN THEY WOULD BE BEST TO ANSWER THE- THE OUTCOME OF THESE TOOLS AGAIN WE JUST HELP WITH MORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE PROCUREMENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. A FOLLOW UP QUESTION NOT TO JUMP AHEAD I'M GOING TO GO TO IF YOU WERE DONE I WAS GOING TO GO TO- VICE CHAIR BATES BUT ISN'T THE CURE MEANT A PART OF- HOW A SELECTION OCCURS YOU PUT TOGETHER THE PROCUREMENT I KNOW IN AS PART OF PROCUREMENT IT'S ARE YOU ALSO REACHING OUT AND BE IN DIVERSE AND THE AND THE POTENTIAL. CONTRACTORS THAT YOU MIGHT OR CONTRACTS YOU MIGHT BUT ISN'T PROCUREMENT IN AND OF ITSELF. THE ART OF SELECTING- TECHNOLOGY OR WHATEVER THE IT IS WHATEVER THE PROCUREMENT IS FOR IS ENDING IT IS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR PROCUREMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THERE IS SOME- TOOLS THAT YOU CAN BUY THAT- BETTER ON ASIA IT'S CALLED A- I GET A LIST THAT YOU CAN BE ON POINT BLANK FIVE BY THAT AND AGAIN YOU USUALLY YOU SEND OUT- DIFFERENT. BIDS SO THAT YOU GET THE BEST BID AND YOU CAN ALSO EVALUATE- THE CRITERIA SO AND AGAIN WHAT WE WHAT MY ROLE IS REALLY ASK PROGRAM AREAS WHAT IS THE CRITERIA. FOR LOOKING AT THIS TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T MEET YOUR CRITERIA- AND I WOULD LIKE TO THE PROGRAMMER IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IT'S EFFECTIVE- THAT MEETS THEIR GOALS FOR THEIR DEPARTMENT. I SEE. SO THE THING YOU YOU PROCURE IS SEPARATE FROM THE CONSIDER THE IN HOUSE OF COMPUTER I. T. PEOPLE WHO WOULD THEN BE USING IT SO. THEY THEY SEEM TO BE TO SEPT OKAY I UNDERSTAND YES. I'M I'M GONNA THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION MISS MONTGOMERY I'M GOING TO GO TO VICE CHAIR BATES NEXT. ADVISED HERE ARE YOU READY. I JUST MADE A SPEECH THAT NONE OF YOU HEARD YOUR MIND. BUT I'M SURE IT WAS BRILLIANT MANIFIESTO HERE YEAH IT'S JUST LETTING YOU KNOW YES I WAS READY BUT I WAS TRYING TO GET MY PAPERS IN ORDER HERE SO. ANYWAY I THINK YOU BOTH OFF FOR- STEPPING FORWARD AND JOB BEING IN THIS PROFESSION FOR AS LONG AND CERTAINLY- AS EFFECTIVELY AS YOU HAVE DONE BASED ON YOUR RESUME STAND OUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED TO YOU IN THE EARLY INTERVIEWS- I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH MISS LOPEZ WITH A FEW FOLLOW UPS THAT I HAVE AND I AM BEING ACCOMMODATED I'M WORKING FROM MY DISTRICT OFFICE. SO I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO INTERVIEW YOU BET SO I HAVE REVIEWED THE MATERIAL YOU KNOW AND- I WILL CITE CONCERNS ABOUT START WITH MISS LOPEZ WITH- THE- DATA ON CDC ARE- THE APPLICATIONS FOR OFFICERS HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. I THINK WHEN COMPARED SHOT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS CERTAINLY CORBIN MIGHT HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN PERHAPS A PRISON CLOSURES OR PLAYING A ROLE AND THE JOB SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE OF CONCERN TO THOSE STEPPING FORWARD TO GET INTO THIS PROFESSION. BUT I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE FIVE WAYS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING OUT TO RECRUIT MORE OFFICERS AND ALSO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WILL SPECIFICALLY INTO GETTING ARE ALL WOMEN HI INVOLVED IN THIS PROFESSION. AND THAT THAT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WITH YOU KNOW THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THE ABILITY TO REALLY REACH OUT PERSON TO PERSON AND SHARE I'LL PROBABLY WHICH YOU WOULD IF YOU'RE STILL THERE MISS LOPEZ I THINK YOU WOULD DEFINE IT AS A GLORIOUS CLEAR CAREER THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT ARE MAYBE SHARE AYE YOU'RE FIVE- THE FIVE WAYS THAT YOU ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR GOALS ON THE WAY YOU'RE DOING THAT HOW WE SHARE WITH US HOW THAT'S WORKING- YEAH AND- IF THERE'S OTHER. THINGS. THAT YOU'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY THAT WORK BETTER- OR NOT SO WELL ABSOLUTELY CENTER RATES THANK YOU MUCH FOR QUESTION- YOU KNOW I EIGHT YEARS. OF MY WITH HE'S OFFICER SELECTION PLAY DEVELOPMENTS WITH WHICH OAK WITH AND TRAINING OF OFFICERS AND SO WE DID WHAT WE WRAPPED UP THE ACADEMY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN WE SAW QUITE A FEW APPLICATIONS DURING THAT TIME WE RECEIVING PROBABLY FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS A MONTH. AT ONE POINT WE PROBABLY HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS THAT WERE IN PROCESS WE DID SEE A DECLINE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH THE APPLICATIONS COMING IN. AND THAT WAS REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WAS NATION WIDE IT WAS NOT- JUST- IT WAS NOT JUST IMPACTING CDC ARE- WE BUILT A VERY ROBUST A RECRUITMENT PROGRAM- THIS STARTED WHEN- THE ACADEMY RE OPENED AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. AND CREATED A STATEWIDE RECRUITMENT TEAM- THAT WAS HELPING OUT WITH ALL OF THESE JOB FAIRS THEY WERE TENDING- ALL THE RECRUITMENT WITH THE MILITARY- SO THERE IS A RECRUITMENT FOR. A SPECIAL RECRUITMENT FEMALE LIKE YOU. YEAH WE DID SEE AN INCREASE WE CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN FEMALES- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS EVEN WITH THE DECLINE IN APPLICATIONS- BUT DEFINITELY- WE WERE VERY STRATEGIC IN HOW WE WERE RECRUITING YOU KNOW I WOULD GET QUESTIONS. ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS HOW COME I'M NOT SEEING MORE OF THIS GROUP OR THAT GROUP YOU KNOW I GRADUATION WHAT DO Y'ALL DO WE- SO WE WERE CONSTANTLY BEING CHALLENGED YOU KNOW BY FOLKS WHO WERE ASKING WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT RECRUITMENT. AND THE RECRUITMENT TEAM IS EXTRAORDINARY- UP FOR CDCR CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT ALL THE WORK THEY DO- ON A DAILY BASIS AND EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO HAD THEIR- CONVERTS TO BIRCH YOU'LL LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE WORLD. AND SO TRYING TO DO VIRTUAL FARES AND- GET PEOPLE TO COME- HAS BEEN CHALLENGING BUT THEY CONTINUE TO GET MORE APPLICATIONS. AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY SEE A DECLINE AROUND THE HOLIDAYS AND THEN THE NUMBERS INCREASE- AFTER IT USUALLY IN JANUARY FEBRUARY. WE ACTUALLY SAW AN INCREASE IN DECEMBER. AND SO NOT QUITE SURE WHY BUT WE DID SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ONE OF THE PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST WE'VE SEEN IN PROBABLY A YEAR AND A HALF- I WILL SAY THOUGH THE RECRUITMENT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AS FAR OUT AS WE HAVE. MAINTAINED THE ACADEMY- WE FILL THE ACADEMY EVERY- CHANCE THAT WE GET WE HAVE NOT HAD A TIME WHERE WE DID NOT HAVE PEOPLE IN. OUR PROCESS TO GO TO THE ECONOMY AND WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR NUMBERS OF FEMALES. IT IS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO GET THE EMAILS AND WE HAD REACHED OUT. TO A NUMBER OF OUR APPLICANTS AND PARTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE ACADEMY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND ITS SINGLES SO IT CAN BE- YOU KNOW. AND FOR MALE APPLICANTS AS WELL CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO BE AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR THIRTEEN WEEKS- BUT THERE'S WE ARE ACTUALLY ENTERING INTO APPROACH. PROGRAMMATIC MARKETING CONTRACTOR. FURTHER EXPAND OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND THIS WILL INCLUDE FOR RECRUITING PEACE OFFICERS AND AS WELL AS NON PEACE OFFICERS BECAUSE WE DO. HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WITH RECRUITING SOME OF OUR NON PEACE OFFICER CLASSIFICATIONS AS MENTIONED EARLIER- BUT I'M REALLY AGAIN PROUD OF THE WORK THAT'S NOT BY THE RECRUITMENT TEAM FOR CDC ARE. THEY AREN'T WORKING NONSTOP. AND TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE YOU KNOW GET PEOPLE TO APPLY. WE'RE DOING- WE'VE TRIED WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST IT'S CALLED THE ONE STOP HIRING. AND IN THOSE HARD TO FILL LOCATIONS. SUCH AS SUSANVILLE- SANK A MARIN COUNTY- A PELICAN BAY AREA. CITY. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AND STOP SO THEY WERE SIX. WE DID THIS A YOU. SIX AS THEY HAVE- ONE STOP HIRING WHERE YOU CAN COME IN AND APPLY TAKE THE WRITTEN EXAM AND THAT'S TWO STEPS OUT OF THE SELECTION PROCESS RIGHT THERE THAT THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE. BECAUSE ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE WOULD GET WAS BIG THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T TRAVEL TO CERTAIN AREAS AND- WE DID EXPAND ON THAT AS FAR AS WHERE WE WERE RECRUITINGAND WHERE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE PEOPLE. WE WERE A COMEDY EATING- APPLICANTS ON THE WEEKENDS WE ARE DOING- EVENING RECRUITMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE REGULAR JOBS DURING THE DAY. SO THERE'S BEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS YEAH- THEY CONTINUE TO THINK OF MORE TO SEE HOW WE CAN GET MORE APPLICANTS AND AGAIN NOT ONLY FOR PEACE OFFICERS. BUT FOR OUR NON PEACE OFFICER CLASSIFICATIONS SUCH AS COOKS. OF PLANT OPERATIONS- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. VERY GOOD I AM SPEAKING OUT THEIR JOB FAIRS ALL OVER THE STATE AND CERTAINLY MANY OF US ARE LEGISLATORS HAVEL'S JOB FAIRS OR OUR PARTNER WITH THEM SO. PROBABLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP US DIALED IN ON THAT ALSO. ANOTHER ON REFLECTION I AM THE FOCUS ON- THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN THE REHABILITATION PART OF THAT. MIGHT BE SOMETHING BASS FROM THE MORE INTEREST TO THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING A CAREER IN CORRECTIONS ARE YOU DOING MUCH TO USE THAT AS A FOCUSED ESPECIALLY WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE FOLLOWING. I THINK ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT CAREER STUFF THEY LOOK AT IN A LOT OF PEOPLE COME THROUGH. I THINK HE'S PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY OF- THOSE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING I THINK TO WORK IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS A MEANINGFUL. CAREER PATH HI HAVE YOU TRIED TO USE THAT IN YOUR MARKETING IN YOUR OUT OF REACH. YES I ALSO WOULD NOT AMOUNT F HOUSING PEOPLE ANYMORE IT'S REALLY TRY. TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM IN AND GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOT. OF WHEN THEY'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE EARLIER YEARS SO BOB TO ME THAT NOT THAT SHOULD BE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT TOO. MANY IN OUR YOUNGER GENERATION. HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR SOME OF THEM. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND IN THE BEGINNING- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE ADVERTISEMENTS WHEN WE FIRST WERE OPENING MORE. FOCUS MORE ON WHAT THE BENEFITS AND THE PAPERWORK WAS PROVIDED AS YOU KNOW COMING IN AS A NEW SEO. AND OVER THE YEARS WE'VE TRANSFORMED THAT MESSAGING- TO REHABILITATION AND THEN ALL THE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- TO AND APPLICANT WHO WANTS TO JOIN CPEC YARD THEY MAY NOT WANT TO. SEE A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER THE WHOLE CAREER THERE'S CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR. THERE'S A SPECIAL AGENTS THERE'S PAROLE AGENT SO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING- AS FAR AND THIS AGAIN HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR THE LAST PROBABLY EIGHT NINE YEARS. WITH REGARDS TO OUR RECRUITMENT SO YES DEFINITELY DID CHANGE THE MESSAGING- WITH REGARDS TO OUR RECRUITING TO GET MORE PEOPLE AND NOT JUST- FOLKS WHO WANTED TO BE A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER YOU KNOW FOR THEIR THEIR WHOLE CAREER WHICH IS FINE AS WELL. SO HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES- IN OTHER. PROSECUTIONS WITHIN CDCR FOR RESPOND. BOTH HOUSING AND CERTAINLY YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT SO WHEN WE GET TO THE TONIGHT I AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO DEFICIT SO VERY IMPORTANT JOB. THE AGENCY IN OUR GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY THOSE I AS I MENTIONED. IN MY TO GOT OFF ON THE ON THE WRONG FOOT EARLY ON AND JOB NEED TO BE BACK AND BE A ROBUST PART OF OUR CITIZENRY SO. THANK YOU AND I WILL MOVE TO MISS MONTGOMERY- AND AGAIN THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WHILE MEDIAN THIS VERY IMPORTANT AGENCY ARE YOU ONE STOP CONCERNED ABOUT- THE USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR THE LAPTOPS AND THE- THE ACCESS THAT ARE ON INMATES NOW HAVE WHO ARE GOOD NEWS INVOLVED IN THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT FOR EARLY RELEASE ETCETERA BUT IN THE BUDGET TALKING MY NUMBERS HERE CRAP TO HOLD TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO THE BUDGET PROVIDED. TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND LAPTOPS THAT ASSUMING THAT OF THOSE INMATES- AT LEAST THAT MANY OR OR THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT MANY ON WHO WOULD WANT TO YOU KNOW TAKE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT COULD LEAD. TO ESPECIALLY TO EARLIER RELIEF AND IDEALLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE OF THOSE AND I THINK WE DISCUSSED THAT WITH ONE OF THE PREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS FACT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE ARE MONITORING THE INMATES USE OF HAT TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY THEIR EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS. SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. ABLE TO- A RELAPSE AND IN SOME ACTIVITY OR IN ANY SORT OF HARASSMENT THAT CAN GO ON IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY SO YOU CAN SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IF YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION I KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING OF- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN THE IN OUR LAST DISCUSSIONS ON ON THIS BUDGET APPROPRIATION. THANK SENATOR- YES WE HAVE JUST STARTED- WORKING ON THIS- PROJECT AND- I FIND IT VERY EXCITING- THE FIRST THING THAT WE- ARE ARE DOING IT IS REALLY LOOKING AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO I TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S REALLY ARE- THE NETWORK. AND THE SERVERS AND EVERYTHING THAT SUPPORTS THE UNDERLYING- LAPTOPS. SO THE REASON WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THIS ONE AS YOU- WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET THAT MANY LAPTOPS I YOU FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A BAND WITH BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION- AND SECONDLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SECURITY COMPONENTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE GROUND AND IT WOULD BE SEPARATE SO THE INPUT WE CALL INCARCERATED NETWORK VERSES ARE STAFFED WITH THAT HAVE A TOTALLY SEPARATED IT SO THAT- WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MONITOR IT FROM THAT STANDPOINT SECURITY IS VERY IMPORTANT- IN MY ROLE AND- WE ARE BUILDING. TO THAT- RIGHT RIGHT NOW IN FACT. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE- DEPART THAT PROGRAMS- REHABILITATION PROGRAM. AND WHAT'S ON THESE LAPTOPS IT- THEY ARE PUTTING A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THAT'S REALLY HOW THEY'RE ACESSING THE INFORMATION SO IT'S REALLY LIKE- HOW ALL THIS EXPLAINED LIKE IT'S ONE WAY UP THERE'S NO AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO THE INTERNET BUT YOU ARE VERY YOU HAVE THE SECURITY AROUND THAT LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE ACCESSING THEIR CLASSES YES FOR THE PUTTING THE HOMEWORK AND THAT TYPE OF THING. SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT- THEY CAN DO I THINK SOME MESSAGES WITH YOUR TEACHER INSIDE THE APPLICATION BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO EMAIL OR GET INTO THE INTERNET- AND WE DO HAVE THE MONITORING TOOLS ON THAT- THAT'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE I THINK HAT THERE WAS A- PERHAPS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT YOU HAVE THAT. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS. AND I SEE THE BALANCE THAT YOU HAVE THE YOU YOU ANTICIPATED THAT IN THE NEXT. DAY YOU GAVE OF COURSE AND WAS A NEEDED TO BE OUT ASK OUR- FELT I NEEDED TO DO THAT BASED ON THE LAST. ON DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE SO WITH- THIS NUMBER THANK YOU AGAIN I DON'T HAVE ARE THERE OTHER. BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME- CERTAINLY TO ASK ABOUT THE EVD ARE. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND ALL THAT SO- I WILL LET THAT GO AND SAY THANK YOU AGAIN AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT WHEN WE GOT TO. THE POINT OF BOB THE MOTION AND- TO- MOVIE FORWARD. FOR CONFIRMATION SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR LET ME MOVE NOW TO SENATOR GROW.

IN THE CDC OUR SYSTEM WITH KOBE AGAIN. I MEAN EVERYTHING I JUST APPLIED YOU BOTH FOR STANDING UP AND THEM. AND TAKING THESE POSITIONS AND- AND WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY FOR THEIR SAFETY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM. BUT ALSO FOR THE WORKERS AND- YOU KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT SERVED IN THAT IN THAT CAPACITY AS WELL. KEEPING THE INTERNET SAFE AND SECURE. AND SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR- BEING WILLING TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE. AS I DO AS I MISS LOPEZ I'LL START WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THAT CDC ARE FAILED TO ENSURE A REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WORK. AND EVIDENCE BASED AND EFFECTIVE IN WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE RECIDIVISM. YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HIGH RECIDIVISM THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T GO BACK INTO PRISON AND THAT. AND THAT THEIR SUCCESSFUL- AND GET A JOB AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. AS WE WANT TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM SO- WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO IMPROVE THAT- IMPROVE THAT SO THAT THEIR EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS FAITH BASED PROGRAMS PROGRAMS THAT REALLY WORK- AND IS THERE A STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE TO- DIRECT. OF FORMER INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO THESE PROGRAMS SO THEY CAN HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS. OUTSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM. THE SENATOR OF THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THIS IS NOT UNDER MY PURVIEW SO I WOULD SORRY THAT'S OKAY I WOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND- IF YOU TODAY BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY- GET SOME INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR QUESTIONS ON THIS PIECE.

ONLY QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU SO- GOODNESS MY CAMERA IF THAT'S OKAY MISS MCENERY AND- AT. SURVEYS HIS BEEN PROVEN DETER CRIMINAL. IN AND THE PRISON SYSTEM AND A DVR.

SO CAN YOU TELL ME- IF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE ENSURING THAT BIG SURVEILLANCE IS BEING USED AS INTENDED BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK THAT AND IT DOES HELP PROTECT EVERYONE INVOLVED. YES THANK YOU FOR QUESTION- OF MY ROLE IN THE DEPARTMENT IS TO IMPLEMENT THE CAMERAS AND TO PUT ALL INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOR THAT. THE AFFECTED THIS OF THE CAMERAS AND THAT THEY'RE USING THEM- WE MONITOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- THE CAMERAS ARE DOWN SO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE BROKEN OR THAT TYPE OF THING WILL BE- WORKING WITH- OUR VENDOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIX THE CAMERAS AND THAT TYPE OF THING- BUT AS FAR AS- THERE YOU SET UP. ACTIVENESS WE WOULD UP AGAIN I'D HAVE TO WORK WITH THE PROGRAM AREAS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR YOU. OKAY ENGINEERING'S YOU ANSWER AND A QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE CDCR IS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.

THAT WERE ILING AND HE NEEDS. HUGE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES AND FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THAT CAN EITHER OF YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THAT IS THAT IN EITHER OF YOUR CRISIS PERFUMES. THAT DOESN'T BREATH PREVIEW- YEAH WE WORKED WITH- EDT AND WE PUT A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD SHARE THE DATA WITH THEM. AND WE DO HAVE A REGULAR DATA SHARING- WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY. DATA AND THEY WERE ASKING EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR SOME OTHER DATA WE ARE ABLE TO UPDATE THAT DATA SHARING AGREEMENT AND BE ABLE TO RIDE IN THE INFORMATION THEY NEED.

OUR OUR YESTERDAY WITH BOTH OF YOU AND I FELT LIKE IT REALLY HELPED ME WITH WHAT I NEEDED AND SO. ON THE CAMERA ISSUE I WAS GOING TO ASK WITH THAT WAS DISPATCHED AND SOLD THEM FOR. FOR STACEY LOPEZ THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK. WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IN THE MEETING THAT THERE. IN MY PRIOR INCARNATION IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE WAS THAT BUDGET THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU. THAT IS REALLY ANCIENT HISTORY BY. ARE THE BUDGET WAS PASSED AND TOOK SIX MONTHS FOR THE SYSTEM TO ENTERED INTO THEIR BOOKS AND THEY'D ALREADY OVERSPENT THE BUDGET BY A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T EVEN ENTERED IT INTO THE BOOKS TO KNOW THAT IT WAS. LOWER IN SOME ACCOUNTS THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND OF COURSE YOU WAS ANCIENT HISTORY OF BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT JUST SORT OF THE EFFICIENCY AND HOW IT WORKS NOW AND YOUR- RESPONSIBILITY IN THAT SO WE JUST HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE. OF WHERE THAT STANDS IN THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU SAID EARLIER YES I CAN ADDRESS THAT DEFINITELY- YEAH SO I THINK THAT WAS ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AND I RECALL BECAUSE I WAS WORKING FOR THE STATE AT THAT TIME SOWE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE- WE HAVE A BUSINESS BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH FALLS I'M UNDER PERSONS AREA SO AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY IF THERE'S ANY ISSUES ABOUT THAT. SO I TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUE OVER IT- YEAH IDEAS TO HELP OUT BUT THE SYSTEM ITSELF- IS BEEN WORKING IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THE TRACKING OUR EXPENDITURES AND KEEPING AND HOLDING OUR PROGRAMS INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE AN AVAILABILITY CONTROL THAT IS WITHIN- RPI YES FOR THIS SYSTEM. THAT DOES NOT ALLOW PROGRAMS INSTITUTIONS TO GO BEYOND WHAT THEIR ALLOTMENT. SO THAT'S A DEFINITELY A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM- TWO THOUSAND THREE- SO WITH THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL REVIEWS THAT WE HOLD WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONS AND THEN THE TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE CONSISTENTLY ARE CONSTANTLY MEETING WITH OUR PROGRAMS INSTITUTIONS ON THEIR BUDGET SO WHILE WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE WE ARE ALSO DOING A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE.

WITH ME. FOR AND AS IT RELATES TO BODY WORN CAMERAS- THERE IS PROCEDURES THAT- THE PROGRAMS HAVE PUT IN PLACE WHERE WHERE THEY CAN SHUT THE ACTUAL BODY WORN CAMERA OFF. AND SO IF THERE IF THE BODY WORN CAMERAS SHUT OFF FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THE REPORTS THAT- THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE PROGRAM AREAS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO- GO WORK WITH THE- INDIVIDUAL THAT HAD- BODY WORN CAMERA SHUT OFF FOR A TIME BEING- BUT REALLY IT'S FIVE DONE THROUGH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IS NOT DONE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY WAS REGARDS.
