THE COVER NINETEEN EMERGENCY HAS CREATED AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT DEMANDS ON OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES. AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ARE IMPACTED IN BOTH. IN TERMS OF BOTH PERSONNEL AND BUDGETS. CONSIDERING THE DIRE SITUATION WHICH MANY STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES FIND THEMSELVES. HAVE ASKED SENATORS TO PARTNER BILL PACKAGES BACK TO INCLUDE ONLY BILLS. THAT ADDRESS THE MOST IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND THAT TO NOT ADD RESPONSIBILITIES FOR COSTS. AS A RESULT WE WILL HEAR FAR FEWER BILLS THEN WE WOULD UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. I DEEPLY APPRECIATE ALL MEMBERS COOPERATION. THERE ARE FIVE BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA THREE OF THOSE BILLS ARE ARMED CONSENT. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE TO RECOGNIZE THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES AND WHO WILL NOT BE- PARTICIPATING HERE. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED MADAM SECRETARY CAN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. SENATOR LEYVA HERE. SENATOR WILK PRESIDENT. WILL CARE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR A CONVENING THIS COMMITTEE HEARING UNDER- EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS SO LEADERSHIP- I WAS ONE OF THOSE SENATORS WHO I THINK HAD SEVEN EDUCATION BILLS AND DROP SIX OF A MAN SO HERE I AM WITH THE- THE ONE BILL THAT WAS IN MY OPINION DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC SO I'M- PLEASED TO- PRESENTED. I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO- THE BURBANK- UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THEIR PRESIDENT DIANA **** WHO SUGGESTED THIS BILL TO HER SUPERINTENDENT WHO ALSO RESPONDED POSITIVELY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT SB EIGHT OH FIVE IS THAT IT CAME FROM. THE TEACHER SIDE THE- THE LABOR SIDE AND IT WAS IN BRACE BY THE MANAGEMENT SIDE AS SOMETHING TO- TO CONSIDER AND SO I THINK THAT GIVES IT A SPECIAL POSITIVE CIRCUMSTANCE AND IT WAS AN OUTGROWTH OVER THE FIRES WHERE MANY A SCHOOL EMPLOYEES LIVED IN AREAS OF THE STATE. WERE EVACUATED- DUE TO A NATURAL DISASTER WHOSE SCHOOLS WERE STILL WORKING BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE STATE AND SO THEY WERE FORCED TO USE THEIR SICK TIME THOUGH THEY WERE IF YOU WAITED IN STE THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TAL. YOU KNOW OUR PLEASE. WHETHER THEY'RE A CLASSIFIED. MAINTENANCE FOR FACULTY TEACHERS GET AFFECTED BY THESE NATURAL DISASTERS INCLUDING PANDEMICS AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED THAT AS WELL- EIGHT OH FIVE PROHIBITS A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM ACQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO USER PAID LEAVE IF I'M ABLE TO REPORT TO WORK ADDITIONALLY EIGHT OH FIVE CLARIFIES THAT SCHOOLS WILL RECEIVE THEIR EIGHTY EIGHT. WHICH I BELIEVE WAS WORK OF SENATOR JACKSON YEARS AGO TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MADE WHOLE AND WE CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCING PANDEMICS TO COVERT NINETEEN- AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS WE THINK THIS IS A LAUDABLE PROPOSAL TO BE CONCERNED- FOR THIS LOOK THIS BODY I TO WILL ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES- DON'T FACE FINANCIAL HARM. WHEN A NATURAL DISASTER OCCURS THE COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE TAKING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND SO MY STAFF- WAS PLEASED TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF THANK YOU SO WILL TAKE ALL OF YOUR CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS- WHICH I THINK MAKE THE BILL STRONGER- WITH ME I BELIEVE. VIA CONFERENCE IS- TRISH TRISTEN BROWN FROM C. F. T. ANCEPT BRAMBLE FROM CTA WHO WILL EXPRESS SOME SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. AND SO I THINK THIS SOLVES A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS AND- I KNOW THERE FISCAL ISSUES WHICH WE WILL ADDRESS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO. BE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEE HOW IT FITS INTO THE OVERALL EDUCATION BUDGET. BUT ON THE POLICY MERITS I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO WELL DONE ALRIGHT WE THINK- I'M NOT SURE WHERE- TRISTEN BROWN AND SETH OR- HAVE THEY CALLED IN ON A LINE. AND DOES THE MODERATOR HAVE ANYBODY WAITING.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- TEN FORTY I WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- CERTAINLY ONE EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND THE IDEA THAT- TEACHERS SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY WERE. LIVING IN A DISASTER AREA. I THINK THE ONE ISSUE AND I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL- DRESS THAT PERHAPS IN THE AND APPROPRIATIONS IS. I DO I DO RECOGNIZE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS- MAY BE A SITUATION WHERE THEY MAY HAVE EACHERS WHO DO LIVE IN ITS ASTORIA BUT THEY THEMSELVES ARE NOT AND THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. AND AT SOME POINT IN TIME YOU KNOW. RECOGNIZING THAT THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES CANNOT BE IN THE CLASSROOM- MEANING THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GONNA HAVE TO FIND. SOMEONE ELSE TO PROVIDE THE TEACHING AND THEREFORE- MAY NEED SOME FINANCIAL SUPPORT EVENTUALLY. IF IT'S FOR PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME SO I HOPE YOU'LL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IS THIS BILLS MOVING FORWARD- BUT ONLY SUPPORT THE BILL WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THIS TIME. IF IT'S APPROPRIATE GREAT. THANK YOU LAWCENTER PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GOOD I KNOW THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO.

THANK YOU BUT SURE NUMBERS- APPRECIATE DARK 20% THIS BILL- REMOTELY. AND I'M PRESENTING SB EIGHT SIXTY. THIS IS A BILL WHICH WILL PROVIDE UP FAST FOR A COMPLETION. AMONG FOSTER YOU THAT'S THE- FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT ASSISTANCE. OF FORM THAT YOU FILL OUT TO GET YOUR STUDENT AID IN COLLEGES AND- THIS ONE SURE THEY HAVE SUPPORT TO ACCESS THE FINANCIALLY THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE ARE RIGHT-NOW- MORE THAN EVER FOSTER YOU NEED OUR SUPPORT. AND WHEN CRISIS IS HAPPENED FOSTER YOU FOR OFTEN GET THE HARDEST AND ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT A GIVEN THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO ACCESS VARIOUS RESOURCES MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL. AND WE HAVE AN URGENCY TO EMPOWER FOSTER YOUTH TO PURSUE A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND GAIN HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE JOBS IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF STEPS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE BOLD ACTIONS TO INVEST MORE FUNDING IN FINANCIAL AID SPECIFICALLY FOR FOSTER YOU. HOWEVER THE ADVOCATES IN THE FIELDS OF IDENTIFIED THIS FAST WELL COMPLETION. CONTINUES TO BE A BARRIER FOR STUDENTS. TO ACCESS THE FUNDS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO OUR RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA FORTY PERCENT- OF THE FOSTER YOU- ONLY RECEIVED THE FEDERAL. PELL GRANT FOR FOSTER YOU OF THIS OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONLY ELEVEN PERCENT- ACTUALLY GET CAL GRANTS SO THAT'S A PRETTY BAD RATE AND- I'M SURE THOSE OF YOU OF FAMILIAR WITH THIS FAST FOR FORM. NO HELP COMPLEX AND FRUSTRATING IT IS THIS THINK OF WHAT IT MEANS T OUR FOSTER YOU SO COMPLETING AT IS A FIRST STEP AND WE LEAVE FOSTER YOU TO NAVIGATE IT ON THEIR OWN- WHICH RESULTS IN INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS AND OF COURSE THEY OFTEN MISS THE DEADLINES. ARE THIS BILL DOES. IS TWO THINGS IT FIRST OF ALL PROVIDES THE ROLE OF THE FOSTER YOU'VE COORDINATING PROGRAM TO INCLUDE. IS TO SUPPORT THE FAST. SHIN AMONG US YOU AND A WHAT ALSO ADD THE FAST FOCUS RATE TO THE BY AN RATE. OF RIGHT NOW ALL OF WITH THE VIRUS SO THE FASTER YOUTH WHEN THEY DON'T APPLY FOR. THESE GRANTS WHAT THEY HAVE IS EMPLOYMENT LOT ON DON'T HAVE EMPLOYMENT ANYMORE BUT RETAIN THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE BY WORKING. AND THE EMPLOYMENT HAS DRPPED AWAY FROM HOME THEY HAVE NO FAMILIES AND- THE ONLY THE ONLY CHOICE THEY HAVE IS TO DROP OUT SO WE NEED TO HAVE THE GRANTS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. AVAILABLE TO HOME AND INCREASE THE COMPLETION RATE FOR THERE ARE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES SO WE I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TIME WITH SPEAKERS IN FAVOR. OF DEBBIE RAUSCHER FROM THE JOHN BIRCH BURDEN ADVOCATES AND EMERALD EVANS WHO'S WILLING TO SHARE HER STORY IN THE FOSTER USE SYSTEM. HOW THIS BELT BILL WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED HER AND OTHERS SO THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

PLEASE FLAT YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU YES. OKAY MY NAME IS TERRY ROZIER AND I'M WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YEARS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AS CENTER BELL SHARED RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF FOSTER TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE ARE MISSING OUT ON CRUCIAL FINANCIALLY. COMPLETING THE FASTER IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS OBTAINING FINANCIAL AID HOWEVER MANY FOSTER YOUTH ARE LEFT TO NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS WITHOUT GUIDANCE RESULTING IN LOW COMPLETION RATES. TWENTY SEVENTEEN MY ORGANIZATION CREATED THE FOSTER YOUTH STOPS AT CHALLENGE PARTNERING WITH COUNTY SAUCE DO SERVICES COORDINATED PROGRAMS ARE FY IS SHE PEES. THE RATE OF SOUTH TO COMPLETION AMONG HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS IN FOSTER CARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES ALREADY ARTICULATED FOR THESE PROGRAMS IN STATUTE TO SUPPORT POST SECONDARY MATRICULATION. WITHIN FIFTY COUNTY NOW PARTICIPATE AND THIS VOLUNTARY EFFORTS HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN TRAFFIC COMPLETION RATES FROM 45% 258% OVER TWO YEARS LEVERAGING OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. COMING NINETEEN POSES A SPECIAL RISK TO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WITH EXPERIENCE IN FOSTER CARE HOPING TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE. STUDIES AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA SHOW THAT WOULD SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES SHUT DOWN THEIR CAMPUSES THE MOST DISADVANTAGED YOUTH WERE THE ONES MOST LIKELY. TO BE PERMANENTLY KNOCKED OFF TRACK. THEREFORE ACTUALLY PIECES MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WITH STAFF TO COMPLETION AND SB EIGHT SIXTY WILL CODIFY THIS WORK INTO LAW. INSURING THAT THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A STATE WILL NOT BE REVERSED. AT A TIME WHEN THESE RESOURCES WILL BE NEED IT THE MOST. THE STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE BECOME INCREASINGLY DISCONNECTED FROM HIGH SCHOOLS AS A RESULT OF THE CRISIS. USE HER IN THE CARE AND CUSTODY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
