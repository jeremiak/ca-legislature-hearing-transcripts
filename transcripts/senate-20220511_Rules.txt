YES SURE THANK YOU- MADAM PRO TEM AND I WILL I WILL DIRECT OF MINE- TO THE SPECIFIC. APPOINTEES I'M SO MY FIRST SO I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU ALL ALL OF YOU ACTUALLY FOR- SPENDING SOME TIME WITH ME THE OTHER DAY- IN PREPARATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR HEARING- I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS INCREDIBLY BUSY SCHEDULES I KNOW THAT WE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT- SB TWO- THAT WAS A- PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT- INVOLVED SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO MANY DISCUSSIONS- HAPPENED- IN ANTICIPATION OF THE BILL AND WHILE IT WAS CIRCULATING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- AND IT REALLY ALLOWED PEOPLE TO HAVE SOME DEEP AND SOMETIMES- UNCOMFORTABLE BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS AND REMAINS AGREEMENT THAT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE- EMPLOYED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARE SAFE ARE TRAINED- AND FEEL- THAT THEY ARE- BEING SUPPORTED BY OTHER FOLKS ON THE FORCE- AND FOLKS WHO ARE THEIR SUPERVISORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE WANT HEALTHY PEOPLE WORKING HEALTH LEVY- YOU KNOW- ESPECIALLY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING TO KEEP US ALL SAFE. AND SO- MISTER BARCELONA I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I WANTED TO KNOW- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE RETROACTIVITY OF S. B. TWO- BECAUSE I KNOW. THAT MANY FOLKS HAVE SORT OF RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL MEAN FOR NOT JUST POST BUT ALSO FOR HOW WE WORK TOWARDS- MEANINGFUL DECERTIFICATION. I THINK THAT- THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A LEGAL QUESTION THAT HAS. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME INSTANCES THAT WERE INVESTIGATED BY THE- FBI THE CALAVERAS GENERAL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THEY WERE CLEARED AND ALL THREE OF THOSE AGENCIES. AND IF THE IF SOMEONE'S PICKED OUT OF THAT IT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A LEGAL CHALLENGE AND- IT'S YET TO BE ANSWERED- I'VE HAD THESE. THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS COME UP TO ME FROM- FROM OFFICERS IN THE FIELD- SOME OF THEM WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION AND PRESIDENT OF AS WELL. AND THERE THEY HAVE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REALLY KNOW THE TOTAL ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE GOING TO BE ADJUDICATED AND- AND DECIDED IN THE COURTS. OKAY AND HOW WOULD HOW WOULD HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. WELL YOU KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS- THE LAST MEETING AND YOUR- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE BILL HAS. HAS THE ITEMS THERE THAT TO YOU KNOW THAT WE CARE THAT THAT THAT THE SENATE CARED ABOUT IN THE GOVERNMENT CARES ABOUT. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DISCUSSION- THIS GOING AROUND SERIOUSNESS CONDUCT WHAT THAT IS. AND YOU'LL EVER WANT TO LOOK UP THE- THE YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS IN THE DICTIONARY BUT I KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF. OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IT I KNOW THAT POSTED SKEWS ME A PHONE JUST KEEPS RINGING HERE I TRY TO LIVE IS STILL DOING THAT- AND THERE'S- QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC A LOT OF. PEOPLE WANT TO GIVE INPUT ON WHAT THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THAT BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO HEAR EVERY. POSSIBLE IF PINION ABOUT WHAT WHAT IT IS BEFORE THE COMMISSION FINALLY MAKES A DECISION ON. OF THE L. ONE TRADER THOUGHT IS TO HAVE SOME LEEWAY THERE SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT. EACH CASE YOU LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEN TRY TO APPLY. THE OF THESE- REQUIREMENTS TO THAT. END AND THEN OUR OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO NARROW IT AND SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR ALL THE OPINIONS ABOUT IT BEFORE I MAKE A FINAL DECISION. HAHA AND- DO YOU HOW DO YOU BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT CAME UP. YOU KNOW OF WHICH IS HOW DO WE HOLD MEMBERS OF OUR OWN TRIBE ACCOUNTABLE. AND DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I MEAN HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK POST. PLAYS IN MATH AND HOW- DO YOU THINK POST CAN PLAY A BETTER ROLE. IN THAT. ALL IT'S ACCOUNT. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE IN THE OFFICE WHILE THE OFFICERS BUT I MEAN IF COMMISSIONERS ARE DOING SHADY STUFF I GUESS THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO OF COURSE ALL OF WELL YOU'RE TALKING TO ME AND SOME OF US ARE PEACE OFFICERS AND SO ON SO YEAH WELL WE OBVIOUSLY WERE ALL HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY OUR DEPARTMENTS AND ALL THE POLICIES AND POST PROCEDURES BUT I THINK. EVERYBODY THAT I'VE MET ON THIS CONDITIONS EXTREMELY DEDICATED TO DOING THE RIGHT THING AND FOLLOWING ALL OF THE LEGISLATION RULES SIX SEVEN WITHOUT HOST HOUSES WELL M. YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF US WHO REALLY WANT TO READ AND KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ANY CASE THAT FLOW OF RAW OF POSSIBLE WRONGDOING SO THAT WE MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION. I THINK THAT EVERYBODY ON THE COMMISSION VERY COMMITTED TO THAT INCLUDING MYSELF AND I THINK EVERYONE IS HONEST AND FORTH WITH THEM AND WANTS TO DO THAT SO I THINK WE'RE IN A REALLY GOOD SPOT AT THE FOLKS- THAT WE- WORK WITH OPPOSE STUCK MISTER DISSOLVED MENTIONED BANNY AND EVERYBODY THERE THEY'RE EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE THE STAFF THE POST HOUSING HIGH- THE HIGH BAR THAT- POST HAS FOR THEM SO I THINK THAT- WEREN'T A VERY GOOD POSITION WITH STAFF AND COMMIT. TO YOUR- IT CAN THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE ONE- I HAVE A QUICK ACT FOR CHIEF GORDEN WHICH IS. I'D LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING- ON BECOMING AREN'T GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BEFORE BECOMING AN OFFICER IN A WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE NOW HAPPENING THAT- OFFICER SHOULD HAVE BE AS- AND IF WE GET IT. YEAH I THINK EDUCATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A QUALIFIER TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO SHOW A COUNTY NEED TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME EDUCATION AS IT LEAST STARTED. THEIR EDUCATION- BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO I THINK THAT WE LIMITS SOME OF THE POOL OF APPLICANTS THAT WE HAVE. IF WE DON'T ALLOW FOR EDUCATION TO HAPPEN CONTINUOUSLY ONCE THEY BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE INCENTIVES THAT WE OFFER AS AN AGENCY IS THAT WE PAY FOR FURTHER EDUCATION. WHO WILL PAY FOR THEIR TUITION THEY GIVE THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE- TO COMPLETE THAT. THE WE HAVE CANDIDATES THAT COME IN THAT OR FROM MINORITY FAMILIES WHO ARE ACTUALLY THE PRIMARY SUPPORTERS OF THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE SAME- OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHEN THEY COME IN. SO I THINK THAT YES EDUCATIONS IT CAN IMPORTANT COMPONENT BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A QUALIFIER BY ITSELF. WERE WHETHER OR NOT WE HIGHER NOT LOOKING. GREAT BUT MY UNDER IS THAT YOU MANY OF YOUR OFFICERS ALL HAVE THE IS TO BE A DEGREE. MANY OF MY OFFICERS DO IN FACT THAT BA DEGREES IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE AND I ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL OFFICERS THAT HAVE THEIR MASTER'S DEGREES DISQUALIFIER. I AM NOT IN IN FAVOR OF IT BEING A DISQUALIFIER I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I CLEARLY BELIEVE IN EDUCATION I HAVE AN EDUCATION. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T MY WIFE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT I DID AND SHE WENT BACK LATER IN LIFE AND AFTER TAKING ONE CLASS AT A TIME OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN BACKING A BENCH LEE GOT HER BACHELOR'S AND HER MASTER'S DEGREE AND THEN HER LICENSE TO PRACTICE SO I THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT PATH. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION WORN WORK LOOKING AT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE. I THANK YOUNG MAN PART TIME I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION ACTUALLY FOR- MISS NATO CHIEF YES YES OF COURSE PART OF ME WANTS TO ASK HER ABOUT- HER ALBUMS AND HIT RECORDS YOU KNOW TINA MARIE- BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW- BUT OUT OF THE SCOPE OF. ITS FIRST ACTION THAT'S RIGHT THIS COMMITTEE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT BUDGET MANTLE YOU- AS WELL AS CHIEF GORDON HAVE OUR CHIEF OF SMALLER CITIES BUT YOU'VE ALSO SPENT A PORTION OF YOUR CAREER WITH LAPD WHICH IS A VERY LARGE- POLICING CITY AND- AS IT RELATES TO SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HOW YOU'VE BEEN- SORT OF. YOU KNOW PRIMED FOR A SERVING ON POST AND THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING AS IT RELATES TO TRAINING AND YOU KNOW SUPPORTING CULTURE CHANGE WITHIN DEPARTMENTS. AND THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS AND WHAT MISCONDUCT LOOKS LIKE DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF INSIGHT ON DO YOU BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCES OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLICING SMALL CITIES AND POLICING IN LARGE CITIES AND WHAT. INSIGHT YOU HAVE THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU OR THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEAN ON- WITH SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW OUR DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT YOU HOW WE MANAGE- MISCONDUCT IN TRAINING AND STANDARDS. IN JUST ONE. YEAH I JUST NAY THAT'S AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION- YOU KNOW ON ON TOP OF IT LET ME ADD THAT I'M ALSO AN ARMY VETERAN- I WAS A CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY SO I ALSO AROUND SMALL LARGE UNITS ON THERE AND HAD TO DO ON WITH TRAINING ALSO BECAUSE TRAINS A VERY IMPORTANT KEY TO ANY ORGANIZATION TO KEEP IT RUNNING AND KEEP IT HEALTHY- BUT IT BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE COMING FROM A LARGE AGENCY THE LAST TEN YEARS WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. I ACTUALLY WAS A COMMANDING OFFICER SURROUND LARGE PARTS OF THE CITY- IT WAS LIKE BEING A CHIEF OF A LARGE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LAPD BEING TEN THOUSAND SWORN OFFICERS I KNOW THEY'RE DOWN ABOUT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED BECAUSE THEY HIRINGS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT- WHEN YOU COME FROM A VERY LARGE AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING THEY CAN DEDICATE PEOPLE- TO WORK CERTAIN JOBS TO HELP TRAIN OFFICERS SO YOU HAVE COMPLETE TRAINING UNITS- AND THEY DO A LOT OF THE WORK- IS TO KEEP UP ON THE TRAINING THAT COMES OUT OF POSTED. AND ANY OTHER MANDATES THAT THAT COME OUT OF EITHER THE STATE OR ON A FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO FOR BIG AGENCIES IT'S KIND OF PACKAGED UP FOR YOU ARE COMING TO LITTLE AGENCY MY FIRST WORDS WERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE TO DO MY OWN WORK AND- THAT TRANSLATED INTO WITH SMALLER AGENCIES IT'S MORE DIFFICULT. TO KEEP IT SEES TRAINED AND SO YOU HAVE TO START LOOKING AT IT FROM A MORE REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE A REALLY WITH YOUR- ALLIED AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT YOU CAN TRAIN- YOU YOU KNOW YOUR FOLKS IN THERE FOR THE SAME TIME DOESN'T GET CONSTRAINTS. PERSON SINCE- YOU KNOW I'LL FORWARD TO BEING A POST BECAUSE I DO SOME I. OF HOW WE CAN. THE MEDIUM SIZE AND SMALLER AGENCIES IN OUR STATE WHICH ARE THE BALK. OF THE AGENCIES OR PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO DOES BRING A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OR I BRING THAT UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE- TO THE COMMISSION. HAVING SERVED IN- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT CAPACITIES THAT I HAVE IN THE PAST. RIGHT THANK YOU AND THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR COME LONGER META VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THIS ONE'S DIFFICULT TO ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND HAVE EVERYBODY ANSWER SO. I JUST LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR REVIEW FOR STEPPING FORWARD AND PARTICIPATING IN WHAT I THINK WE ALL BELIEVED TO BE A VERY VERY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICAN IN NEW ROLE ARE THERE TO BE PLAYING IN THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. AND I KNOW ARE YOU SUPPORTED- COMMISSIONERS BARCELONA REVEAL LAST TIME I FELT THAT YOUR SERVICE OVER THE FIFTH AT TIMES BE AN AUTHOR LEE REMARKABLE YOUR RESUMES ALL OF YOU REMARKABLE SO ARE YOU- ANYONE IS OPEN TO ANSWER MY QUESTION AND IT'S GOING BACK TO THE- THE- OF. OUR DECERTIFICATION AND SPECIFICALLY. WE WHEN WE REVIEW HERE LET'S SAY- COMPLAINTS ABOUT WORK FORCE CONDUCTIN OUR- IN OUR CAPITAL- IN IN OUR- WITH ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND CERTAINLY ON OUR LEGISLATORS ALSO THERE'S A PROCESS THERE'S A STRUCTURE THAT THE COMPLAINT GOES THROUGH. IS THERE ANY CONSTRUCT SURE THAT'S ON YOUR MIND OR THAT IS COMING THROUGH FROM THE TRANSITION TEAM OF HOW OLD THE COMPLAINTS WILL BE RECEIVED AND GO THROUGH A THIRD GOING TO BE A COMMITTEE STRUCTURE OR IS IT GOING TO BE ALL OF YOU AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING AT IT AND ASKING QUESTIONS TO. OBVIOUSLY IF STAFF THAT WILL BRING IT TO YOU COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE FINAL OUTCOME ON EACH AND EVERY COMPLAINT AND- ALLEGATION AND THEN YOUR DECISION OF WHETHER THERE'S A DECERTIFICATION OF THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. SO LET ME ASK YOU MIGHT WANT TO TACKLE THAT FIRST JUST GONNA RAISE YOUR HAND AND ALL RECOGNIZE YOU- THANK YOU- MISTER BRAZIL GO AHEAD. I'LL GO FIRST AND ZERO THREE BOND- SO THIS THIS LEGISLATION COUNTED- DEFINES THE STRUCTURE ITSELF OR HOW IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE SYSTEM- HOW IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE POST COMMISSION SYSTEM. IS GOING TO BE VERY MUCH- RELY ON STAFF PRESENTED HER PACKAGE TO US WE HAD AS THE COMMISSION A LOT OF GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT DO WE BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME MORE ANTICIPATING IN THE VOLUME OF THE FUTURE YOU WERE GREAT SUB COMMITTEES AND IT WAS I DON'T SPEAK FOR ALL THE COMMISSIONERS BUT I GOT A UNIVERSAL LIVE WITH THAT. NOW IF WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS ON PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD WE WANT TO ACTUALLY READ THE ENTIRE IT'S NOT SUMMARIES BACHELOR THE FAX- I KNOW IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE ROOM THEY'RE PART OF THE POST COMMISSION THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AS THEIR STANDARD PRACTICE THEY DON'T ACCEPT SERVICE DISCIPLINE UNEMPLOYED I'M ACTUALLY READING THE CASE SINCE. SOME CHALLENGING SOMETIMES A FAX OR IN THE CASE AND OR THE LEVEL INVESTIGATION SO HOW I SEE IT WORKING FOR THE POST SYSTEM OF STAFF TRACKING MONITORING THE ALL THE BACKGROUND COLLECTING THE DATA COLLECTING THE REPORTS AND THEN PUSH IT OUT TO US AS COMMISSIONERS. FIRST TO THEN REVIEW AND THEN HAVE MEANING SPECIFIC TO OUR SEGMENTS MEANING SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUAL CASES FOR ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS ARE WELL VERSED IN THAT CASE ON IN EITHER CHALLENGE STAFF TO GO BACK AND GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR CONTINUE ON IN THE PROCESS. OF THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE IT'S NEW TO US- IT'S NEW TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA FIND HICCUPS ALONG THE WAY REUNIFY NEED TO COME BACK THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY LISTEN WE'VE IDENTIFIED SOME ISSUES WITH IN THE LEGISLATION MIGHT YOU BE FINE TUNING- THAT ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE MORE SMOOTHLY. FOR EVERYONE OF ALL. THE OPPOSED TO THE CAN. TO THE- EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS. OF GOING THROUGH THIS CARE PROCESS- TO STREAMLINE IT SO A LOT OF THIS IS ON PAPER NOW. I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT STAFF HAS PRESENTED A POST IN THE PROCESSES CAN BE PUSHED FORWARD. I- I KNOW THAT- DIRECTOR ALVAREZ AND HIS SENIOR STAFF AND DEDICATED FULL TIME STAFF TO THIS FROM THE GET GO- THEY'VE BEEN PULLED OFF OF OTHER. TASKS INPUT ON THIS TO DEVELOP THIS BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT TIME LINE- SO. WHAT I CAN DESCRIBE IT IS THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING BUT I TOTALLY EXPECT YOU'LL HEAR BACK FROM US- REQUESTING SOME. KIND OF TWEAKING THE LEGISLATION ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE MORE SWIFTLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS TO YOU THAT WOULD YOU BE COMING BACK AS YOU WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS TO THE LEGISLATURE. I TO TWEAK IT HERE AND THERE SO THAT TIME. THIRDLY THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION I'D LIKE THE REST OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY- TO. COMMENT ON HOW YOU'RE FEELING LAW COMFORTABLE THAT THE STRUCTURE DOES. DOES SUPPORT THE DUE PROCESS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW PROMULGATED AGAIN STAND UP I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN THE ON STAFF INTERVIEWS ABOUT PROTECTING DUE PROCESS. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE pWANT TO BE OF COMPARABLE WITH THAT. IS YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKERS ON F. JUST A QUICK COMMENT FROM EACH ONE OF YOU ON. THE STRUCTURE AND ALL WHETHER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE THAT YET HAS THE GREATEST PROTECTION. FOR THE DUE PROCESS THAT'S OBVIOUSLY. NOT REQUIRED FOR BOTH SIDES OF. OF ANY COMPLAINT I THOUGHT CHIEF NETTERS HAND FIRST WE'LL START WITH YOU CHIEF OF THAT'S OKAY AND THEN I'LL WORK MY WAY. ACROSS I THINK YOU OF TINA AND TINA NIETO- YES THIS IS A BIG DISCUSSION ACTUALLY AT OUR LAST MEETING IN WHEN WE'RE- LOOKING AT DEFINITIONS AND TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS IN FACT OUR LAST SEVERAL MEETINGS. I'M LOOKING AT S. B. TWO- I KNOW FOR THE REST OF THE BOARD FROM LISTENING TO THEIR COMMENTS THAT DUE PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMMAND LEVEL- SWORN PERSONNEL THAT SIT ON THE BOARD. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE DUE PROCESS PROBAR. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I COMMISSIONER RESULT TALKED ABOUT WE WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO SEE. THE ENTIRE CASE AND I SAY THAT TO HIM. WHEN I WAS WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I WAS COMMAND OFFICER. I NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO LOOK AT- VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT CASES AS A COMMAND OFFICER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. BUT I ALSO SET OUT ON WHAT THEY CALL THE BORDER RIGHT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE PEOPLE COULD APPEAL THAT. AND MANY TIMES THE INVESTIGATION WHEN I SAT ON THE BORDER RIGHTS THERE IS INFORMATION ON THAT WAS NOT IN IN THE- CASE- AND THAT. GAVE ME CONCERN AND THEY WERE SLEEPING SWEAR THAT RECOMMENDATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN TERMINATION FOR US IS POSTED MIGHT BE TO CERTIFICATION. AND ALL THE INFORMATION WASN'T THERE I HAVE COMPLETE. O. N. ARM HOST- WHEN IT COMES FOR TO US BUT BUT THAT CERTAINLY IS MY CONCERN. I THE OTHER THING NOW BEEN WITH THE SMALL AGENCY AND WORKING WITH OTHER SMALL AGENCIES- HELP PEOPLE CLASSIFIER- COMPLAINTS IS DIFFERENT FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY. AND AS A PROPOSED COMMISSIONER I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. ON HOW WE DO THAT- SO THAT WHEN THE CASE IS IF THEY DO GO UP TO POST AND THEY MEET THE MANDATES OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. OR THE NINE NINE CRITERIA- THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETED CASE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- I TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT NOBODY WANTS BAD ACTORS ARE BAD APPLES AND POLICE. IN POLICING AND PUBLIC SAFETY IT MAKES EVERYBODY. LOOK BAD OF ONE PERSON TARNISHES THE BADGE IT TARNISHES THE BADGE. NATIONALLY SO WE DON'T WANT THAT BUT IN THE SAME RESPECT YOU DO WANT TO PROTECT. THOSE PEOPLE WHO. REALLY THEIR LIVES AND DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT- WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY THEIR LIVELIHOODS- BASED ON BAD INFORMATION SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT POST WILL GIVE US COMPLETED- CASES ARE THAT WE CAN MAKE. GOOD THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DETERMINATIONS WHEN WE VOTE- BUT THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AT THE BACK OF MY MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR THAT TIME. CHIEF NATURAL OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL ARE BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER SORT OF A CORPORATE PROCEEDINGS. OF THE LAST QUESTION ON ON DEATH- IS THE CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY BECAUSE CERTAINLY WITH OUR WORK FORCE. COMPLIANCE UNIT HERE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY ACCOUNT ALWAYS. ENSURE THAT THERE WON'T BE ON TO A LITTLE BIT OF- YOU KNOW RUMORS AND- LEAKS THAT TUB. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS. UP UNTIL THE FINAL DECISION. TO A SPECIFIC PERSON OR ALL ANYWAY. WELL I THINK GO TO NEED TO OKAY. YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT THIS TO SURE ALL OK CHIEF YES- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PERSONAL ISSUES- YOU KNOW AT LEAST WITH THE AGENCIES YES IT'S NOT LATE BUT- I I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW CLOSE IS GONNA HANDLE IT BECAUSE ONCE. THE CASE ACTUALLY GOES TO POST I BELIEVE THAT- PUBLIC RECORDS ACT YOU YOU CAN CTUALLY SUBPOENA THE CASE I KNOW FROM OTHER CHEESE SAYS AS WE LOOK AT THIS WITH CAL CHIU SAID MAYBE- COMMISSIONER GORDON COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KNOW SHE SITS ON. CAL CHEESE THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND WHAT WILL POST RELEASE OR NOT RELEASE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS- AGAIN I THINK. SURE BARCELONA A LOT ABOUT IT I THINK IT WAS THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CASE LAW AND A LOT OF OPINIONS. ON THAT ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE PROCESS. IN THE COMING YEARS- JUST BASED ON SOME OF THE UNANSWERED. QUESTIONS OR THINGS THAT WE JUST. CAN'T ANTICIPATE WHEN YOU ARE. PASSED LEGISLATION LIKE IT'S SB TWO. JEFF GORDON DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. BUT I WOULD APPROVED- CHIEF ME AT THOSE COMMENTS I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD THE DISCUSSION OF HOW IMPORTANT AND HOW SERIOUS WE ALL TAKE THIS THE CONFIDENTIALITY IS CERTAINLY- VERY IMPORTANT AND IS OF A CONCERN BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR THIS TO BECOME A VOTE OF- PUBLIC OPINION- OF VERSES. HE VOTED BASED ON FACTS THAT AND WE TO TALLY OF THE ENTIRE CASE. SO I THINK IF THINGS BECOME PUBLIC INFORMATION BEFORE THAT OCCURS. THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CASE. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT CONFIDENTIALITY ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH. THE VOTE I'M ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY BUT I'M ALSO FOR DUE PROCESS AND LIKE I SAID IT NOT JUST BECOMING A- THE BILL BASED ON LIMITED INFORMATION SO THAT CONFIDENTIALITY THAT NOT LEAKING OF INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY YOU PRIOR TO POST MAKING A POST MEASURES MAKING A FINAL DECISION IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO DO A FULL EVIDENTIARY HEARING. WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF A BORDER RIGHTS. AND I THINK THAT'S IT IMPORT STEP IN THE PROCESS. BECAUSE IT ALSO THEN IF THERE'S- INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN ANSWERED OR YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF A USE OF FORCE THAT THAT'S AN EXCESSIVE FORCE REALLY BEING ABLE TO FIND OUT. ADDITIONAL ANSWERS IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS IN THE OFFICER'S MIND IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. ONE CONCERN I DO HAVE IS. THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AT THIS POINT PROPOSED COMMISSIONERS WILL SEE THE CASE TWICE. ONCE BECAUSE THE ADVISORY BOARD WITH JUST THE PRESENTATION OF THE CASE ITSELF REPORTER STAFF BASED ON WHAT THEY HAVE. WEEK PRIOR TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND THEN WE'LL SEE IT AGAIN AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. A FOR THE FINAL VOTE I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE COMMISSIONERS MAKING A DECISION WITHOUT ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND THEN POTENTIALLY. OVERTURNING THEIR INITIAL DECISION NOW THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE SO. THAT YOU KNOW IS IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS CORRECTLY AND THAT WOULD BE ONE CONCERN I HAVE IN TERMS OF REALLY DID YOU ACCESS AND- THE- JOB OF THE COMMISSIONERS. WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE- EXCEPTIONALLY THOUGHTFUL ANSWERS TO THAT VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY. YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE AND TO SEE HOW IT FOR WORKING THAT I'M COMFORTABLE THAT YOU ALL ARE. REALLY HAVE YOUR HEART CHEN KNOCK. CERTAINLY YOUR OWN ON LEVEL OF. SERVICE PREVIOUS LEVEL OF SERVICE YOU COME TO THE OFFICE WITH A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND I CERTAINLY I THINK A VERY VERY SINCERE. EFFORT TO BE VERY FAIR OFFER TO BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. FULL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL BE ON CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT. MAN ADVICE HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN THANKS TO MY TWO COLLEAGUES BECAUSE ONE OF THE TWO THINGS I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE DECERTIFICATION AND I THINK. ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DECERTIFICATION CASES ON THE CAPACITY IN PROCESS TO DO IT. YOU BOTH WENT THROUGH THAT VERY WELL. SO MY OTHER- CONCERN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT IN IN GROUPS OF TWO I THANK. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF- S. B. TWO THIRTY ON THE USE OF FORCE. AND M. ALL START WITH THE TO OUR POLICE CHIEFS THE TWO NEWEST MEMBERS BECAUSE THE FARM. YOU'RE SEEING THIS FROM BOTH SIDES GET YOUR- YOU'RE MEMBERS OF POST THAT HAS TO IMPLEMENT. OF USE OF FORCE TRAINING AND UNIFOR'S UNIFORM N OF MOM USE OF FORCE GUIDELINES BUT NOW THEY'VE BEEN IN PLACE FOR A YEAR WHEN YOU'RE BOTH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAS TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAINING IS EFFECTIVE. AND WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THE GUIDELINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK UP I'D START WITH CHIEF GORDON AND CHIEF NAFTA. I THINK THE WE ARE ALL- WORKING THROUGH THIS WE HAVE STARTED IMPLEMENTING AND THIS OUR DEPARTMENT WE STARTED IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY IN TERMS OF UPDATING OUR USE OF FORCE POLICIES OR USE OF FORCE TRAINING- WE'VE ACTUALLY. GONE BACK TO DOING OUR IN HOUSE TRAINING BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE SOME QUALITY CONTROL SO WE HAVE OUR OWN USE OF FORCE INSTRUCTORS AND HAVE BEEN GETTING OUR OWN CERTIFIED WE'VE BEEN- IMPLEMENTING THE TRAINING TO DIFFERENT PLACES WERE TRACKING OR DE ESCALATION. THE WORLD LOOKING ORDER USES OF FORCE DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF. WHAT KIND OF FORCE ARE WORSE ARE WE ARE TYPICALLY SEEN ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CORRECTING ANY OF THESE THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE NEW- YOU SUPPORT STANDARDS AND- AND I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A CULTURAL CHANGE. AND IT'S L. MAKING THAT SHIFT IN HELPING OFFICERS UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S NOT THAT THEY CANNOT USE FORCE BUT IT'S THE EXPECTATIONS OF UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CANNED AND HOW THEY DO THAT AND- THE- THE WAY THAT THE ESCALATION. IS INVOLVED IN THAT. SO I THINK IT'S AN ON GOING PROCESS I THINK THAT. PART OF IT IS HOW WE COMMUNICATED TO OUR OFFICERS BECAUSE JUST. LOOKING AT IT B. O. S. CAN YOU GIVE THEM ALL A BIT OF PAUSE ON. YOUR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- IF I USE FORCE. AND THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN WHEN IT'S- WHEN THE SITUATION CALLS FOR IT BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE IS OFFICERS GETTING HURT. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN ACTION SO I THINK THAT WE ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF HELPING OUR OFFICERS UNDERSTAND THE ESCALATION WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. FROM WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM IT'S A LOT OF IT IS HELPING THEM SLOW DOWN AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TIME WHEN THEY DO AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS. BUT IT'S PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS IT'S PART OF DOING CRITICAL INCIDENT DEBRIEFS YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE TO BODY CANCERS IN CAR CAM SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REALLY SIT BACK AND LOOK AT SOME INCIDENTS. AND DO IT IN A WAY WERE FEEDBACK IS ACCEPTED AND IT'S NOT UNITS. SO THAT WE CAN BECOME BETTER BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ALSO. A BIG COMPONENT OF IT IS LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BE BETTER AND NOT ALWAYS DENIED IT IN TERMS OF OUR PUNITIVE- THERE ARE SOMETIMES IT THAT DISCIPLINE IS WARRANTED. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF LEARNING AND TEACHING WE CAN'T MISS THAT POINT BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT NOW. WE'VE GONE BACK TO HAVING OUR OWN IN HOUSE YES OF COURSE INSTRUCTORS BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT- YOU KNOW. MOVING ACROSS THE MAT TEN TIMES ARE DOING THINGS IT'S ABOUT HOW WE APPLY FORCE AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS MORE IMPORTANT. THAN HOW WE'RE TRAINING OUR OFFICERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE PER. THE VETR. A METAL AND- BY THE WAY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. I THINK YOU'RE ON THE YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE REMEMBERING THE HIT THAT SECOND BUTTON SO ON UP ON SB TWO THIRTY- I LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY- I DO BELIEVE THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF THESE THINGS BEFORE THE LAW WAS EVEN IMPLEMENTED AS FAR AS USE OF FORCE POLICIES- WE ARE WE ARE ALREADY INCORPORATING ON BIASES IMPLICIT BIASES EXPLICIT BIASES- OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE- SPIN AROUND FOR ABOUT. THREE YEARS NOW AND A LOT CHANGED ON THAT AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT- WITH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT USE FORCE IN THIS WAS HAPPENING. IN OUR AGENCIES INCLUDING- MY PRIOR AGENCY AND NOW WITH BRING UP DEPARTMENTS. THE REQUIREMENT TO START REPORTING I THINK THAT- THE EDUCATION PIECE WAS TO EXPLAIN TO THE OFFICERS THIS IS A REQUIREMENT AND WE'RE REPORTING STUFF- THAT MEETS THOSE STANDARDS THAT THE STATUS AS THE SHALL BE REPORTED. I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN AND MAYBE I'M ONE OF THESE COMMISSIONERS THAT HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN AND- MAYBE I THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES. WAY TOO MUCH- IS THAT ALL AGENCIES ARE REPORTING UNDER THE STANDARDS AND NOT INTERPRETING USES OF FORCE IN A WAY THAT IT MAY NOT BE REPORTED METRICS PIECE THAT- IT YOU CAN. AS FAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS HOW DO YOU MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER OR DO WE NEED TO TRY PEOPLE. OR OR WHAT'S STICKING WHAT'S NOT STICKING WITH THE COMMUNITY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE OR HOW THEY FEEL THE WHOLE TRUST PEACE THE WHOLE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PIECE OF IT. I GUESS I LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- BECAUSE I'M ALSO A POLICE PERFORMANCE AUDITOR. ON AND SO I KNOW LIKE N A REGIONAL LEVEL- WITH MY CURRENT AGENCY- WE ASKED ACTUALLY ASKED HER INSURANCE CARRIER- TO COME IN AND HIGHER INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE- GUIDELINES ACTUALLY UNDER S. B. TWO THIRTY AND THEN ALSO ON OTHER HIGH RISK ISSUES. OF WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER. AND QUITE HONESTLY I THINK WE ALL FOUND THINGS OUT- FOR THE SMALLER AGENCIES BECAUSE AGAIN. WE HAVE TO WEAR MANY DIFFERENT HATS AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER HALF THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. A SO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT OVERLOOK MY USE OF FORCE BEFORE IT EVEN GETS INTO MY INBOX ARE ALSO MY PATROL SERGEANTS OR THEY MAY BE AND IN CHARGE OR SOMETHING ELSE- SO WE DON'T WANT TO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS SO. I GUESS- AS A COMMISSIONER I'D BE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS OF WHAT OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY. IS HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOU ARE IMPLEMENTING WHAT SB TWO THIRTY IS GHASTLY DEAL HOST DOES A VERY GOOD JOB. ON WITH ITS TRAINING AND PUSHING THE TRAINING OUT. BUT ONCE THE TRAINING IS PUSHED OUT OR WE KNOW WHAT THE REPORTING PROCEDURES ARE. ARE HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT AGENCIES ARE REPORTING CORRECTLY I GUESS THAT THAT'S MYONLY CONCERN AS FAR AS THE NEW LAW. AND MAYBE I'M OVERTHINKING THAT SENATOR. FROM I DON'T YOU ARE- OF. OVERTIME ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. TO THE SUCCESS OF IT BEING KIM IMPLEMENTED. AND NOW THE WOMAN ASKED THE OTHER TWO ARE COMMISSIONERS THE LONGER TERM ONES. TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT THE POST STANDARDS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS RELATED TO USE AND FORCE ARE ADEQUATE. AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY IMPROVEMENTS. OF THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN AND START WITH COMMISSIONER BARCELONA AND THEN GO TO COMMISSIONER PERCY. THANKS JOHN- I CAN TALK FROM THE STATE SIDE SINCE I HAVE THOUSANDS OF THESE OFFICES IN MY UNIT THAT- BURKE FROM ONE IN THE STATE TO THE OTHER. SINCE THESE BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED AND IMPLEMENTED THE STATE HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR INSTRUCTORS- WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT JOB BOARDS BUREAUS AND DEPARTMENTS- UNIFORMED AND THAT AGENTS AND- PLAINCLOTHES. HAVE ALL BEEN- ALL THAT THOSE INSTRUCTORS HAVE BEEN TRAINED PROPERLY AND I'VE GONE AROUND THE STATE TO TRAINING. WITH ALL THESE VARIOUS AGENCIES AND MEMBERS AND IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT VERY WELL EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTENDED AS AND- EVERYONE IS FINE WITH THE ESCALATION THEY'RE FINE WITH LEARNING ANY NEW TECHNIQUES THAT THEY CAN TO- LESSEN INJURY TO BOTH- A SUSPECT OR THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW SOME AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT I STILL THINK- YOUR YOUR BILL DEFENSIVE TACTICS IS A PERISHABLE SKILL. SOLVE ANYTHING- MORE TRAINING IS BETTER THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT MOST AGENCIES ARE SHORT STAFFED AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND POWER TO ROTATE PEOPLE IN MORE THAN WHAT'S REQUIRED. AND THE OTHER ONE'S PHYSICAL FITNESS- YES SOME PEOPLE- COULD STAY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN THAT THAT. PRETTY MUCH MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T GET INJURED OR ALL OF THE SUSPECTS EITHER. BUT IT'S WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROBLEMS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE UNIT SET UP THAT I- AND INVOLVED. THANK YOU N. DUCKED COMMISSIONER BRAZIL. GREAT QUESTION AND A BY WILL REPEAT HAT- THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS I THINK WHAT WERE THE PIECES WERE MISSING IN THIS IS- YEAH REALLY A ROBUST AFTER ACTION REVIEW PROCESS. OF THE AGENCIES ARE TAUGHT HOW TO CRITICALLY ASSESS WHETHER TO USE OF FORCE OR OTHER TYPES OF CRITICAL INCIDENTS AND COMMISSIONER GORDON BROUGHT UP TO WORD THE ASSESSMENT THE AFTER ACTION REVIEWS ABOUT LEARNING IN SEARCHING FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND THAT SEARCHING FOR SOMEBODY DOING SOMETHING WRONG REPEAT YOU GO TO PUNITIVE DISCIPLINE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS BEING ABLE TO GET STEP BACK AND ASSESS OR DID THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS TO BELGRADE TRAINED WEATHER RIGHT COMMANDED CONTROL STRUCTURES OR THE TOOLS WERE GIVEN THEM WORKING OR THEY'RE NOT WORKING- AND TAT'S THAT PIECE THE U. S. SENATOR ON HOW DO WE KNOW IF IT'S WORKING OR NOT UNTIL YOU BUILD A REALLY ROBUST AFTER ACTION REVIEW PROCESS THEY CAN KIND OF CAPTURE THAT DATA. WE'RE GONNA FALL SHORT- WE'D NOT POST PER SE BUT THE AGENCIES PROVIDING THE DATA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S COMING FROM WE COLLECTED DATA ON THE OUTCOMES SO TO SPEAK BUT NOT ON THE DETAILS OF THE EVENT- THE OTHER PIECE WE'RE STARTING THAT THIS THIS WAY AND AGAIN ALL THREE COMMISSIONERS MENTIONED. IT THIS IS ALL ABOUT DECISION MAKING- YOU KNOW PERSONAL SKILLS ARE. YOUR MUSCLE MEMORY BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE WE'RE FOR. ON IS WE NEED FOR ON HIS DECISION. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. OF ANY ACADEMIES- OFFICERS AFTER SHOW THAT THEY CAN SAFELY HAVE A WEAPON. AND THAT THEY CAN SAFELY HAD A TARGET IN THE THAT THEY'VE QUALIFY BASICALLY BASED ON NUMBER BROWN'S IF THE TARGET. AN ANNUAL WE GO BACK AND DO THE SAME EXACT THING- AND BUT WE DON'T. GIVE THEM SCENARIOS WHERE THEY DON'T SHOOT- BUT OTHERS DO AROUND THEM OR ON IT'S NOT ABOUT NUMBER HOW MANY TIMES THAT THE YOU HIT THE TARGET BUT IT'S ABOUT. DECISION MAKING ACTUALLY SHOOT AT THE TARGET- AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO. INTEGRATE THAT CAN DECISION MAKING INTO USES OF FORCE WERE. USED TO DIVORCE IS IT USED- I CAN ARRANGE FOR SOME PEOPLE MAY SHOOTING SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT. ON THE SAME LINE OF FIRE TO CREATE SCENARIOS SOURCE NOT ABOUT MUSCLE MEMORY IT'S ABOUT DECISION MAKING- AND THOSE THINGS COME OUT AFTER ACTION REVIEWS. IN THE PROCESS SO IT'S- IT'S COMPLICATED IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S NOT ONE THING WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE'RE NOT COLLECTING- AND THAT'S WERE. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE WE CAN HOPEFULLY START PARTNERING WITH SOME OF OUR UNIVERSITIES WE DO ALREADY. BUT HOW DO WE START LOOKING AT FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE. RETURN OF THE VALIDATE THE CHANGES ARE BEING MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN INTO THE AGENCIES ARE. REALLY HAVING A POSITIVE EFFECT. WELL THANK YOU ARE PRETTY DANCER. FOR ALL FOR A FEW. FOUGHT AND THERE WERE WIDE RANGING AND- I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING OUT OF THIS HEARING IS JUST. ARE YOU WE ARE JUST VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF- OF SOME OF THESE LAWS THEIR LANDMARK IN MANY WAYS AND WE KNOW THAT. THAT A LITTLE BIT OF IT IS NEW GROUND IT AND THE WORK THAT YOU DO BUT- I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

SO WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JIM HEALTH AND I'M AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST PRACTICING IN SANTA CLARA. I HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR ALMOST THIRTY TWO YEARS. I'M ORIGINALLY FROM SAN JOSE AND I'VE BEEN A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT MY ENTIRE LIFE. IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE I WAS PASSED BY A COLLEAGUE TO HELP TRAIN RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE I PRACTICE. RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS ARE COMPRISED OF CLINICIANS WHO BRING CRITICAL CARE EXPERTISE TO THE BEDSIDE OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. WHOSE CONDITION IS WORSENING. WITH THE HOPE OF REDUCING HOSPITAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THAT EXPERIENCE SPARKED MY PASSION FOR PATIENT SAFETY WHICH IS KIND OF MY CAREER SINCE THEN. THE FOLLOWING YEAR I WAS APPOINTED TO A HOSPITAL QUALITY PATIENT SAFETY LEADERSHIP ROLE WHICH I HELD FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. SOON THEREAFTER I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE POSITION PEER REVIEW. AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE I PRACTICE AND MORE RECENTLY I HAVE LED UP TO REVIEW FOR KAISER PERMANENTE PHYSICIANS AND ALL THROUGHOUT- THE CALIFORNIA. HE SHOULD SAFETY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I BELIEVE THIS POSITION POSITIONS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE THE CARE WHO PROVIDE. END WITH THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ADDRESS IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IF CONFIRMED I WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO ADVANCE PATIENT SAFETY. IN ADVOCATE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON THE BOARDS LICENSEES TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. IN A PROFESSIONAL HIGH QUALITY AND SAFE MANNER. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE WITH YOU TODAY GOVERNOR NEWSOM FIRST TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO THIS POSITION. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO THANK MY FAMILY FOR THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT- I WOULD FORTY ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR LET ME GO AHEAD AND ASK US SENATE EARLIER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START THIS ROUND THANK YOU ARM. DR WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE- OKAY I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE IS THE EASIER ONE- ARE WITCHES YOU JUST MENTIONED YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THE KAISER- ADVISORY COMMITTEES OF THE PEER REVIEW. HOW DID THAT WORK DOING pDOING THE PEER REVIEW INFORM YOU FOR HAVING TO DO A SIMILAR TASK ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. WELL I THINK MY EXPERIENCE REALLY HELPS ME EVALUATE- MATTERS THAT COME BEFORE THE BOARD I THINK THAT- REVIEW HAS A VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION NOT JUST PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND EDUCATION OF PHYSICIANS. BUT ALSO TO IDENTIFY AREAS CONSENT REQUIRED FOR THE REMEDIATION. I FEEL THAT- THAT MY WORK AS A PEER REVIEW LEADER DOES HELP ME INFORM MY- OF MY WORK ON THE BOARD FOR THE PLAN THAT THAT- EXPERIENCE- AS A MEMBER OF THE- THANK YOU AND THEN LET ME GET TO THE MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION ANALYSIS TO. SOME OF OUR LAST HEARINGS ON THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR PEOPLE AND PHYSICIANS SEATS WERE. RATHER TUMULTUOUS. OF THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT. CONCERN ARISING ON NOW AND YOUR APPOINTMENT BUT IT IS REALLY ABOUT. HOW ARE YOU MAKE SURE. DID YOU REALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE CASES THAT COME IN FRONT OF YOU- AND TAKE A SERIOUS AND FORCEFUL RESPONSE TO OUR- ALLEGATIONS IN TERMS OF THE REVIEW AND GENUINEACTION AND THERE THERE HAS BEEN. NEWS COVERAGE LOTS OF PUSHBACK FROM CONSTITUENCY GROUPS THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING AT THE MEDICAL BOARD HOW WOULD YOU ARE- GIVE US COMFORT THAT. THAT YOUR GOING TO BE SOMEBODY THAT REALLY LOOKS AT THOSE THINGS AND IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE TOUGH STANCE ON CASES THAT REALLY WEREN'T. THANK YOU SENATOR- I TAKE MY ROLE AS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL WORK VERY SERIOUSLY- I'VE BEEN A PATIENT SAFETY LEADER FOR. THE LAST THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS AND- PATIENT SAFETY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME- I BELIEVE THAT AS ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO- OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE THE CARE THAT WE PROVIDE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION WHEN WE IT. A SO I DO- FEEL STRONGLY THAT I CAN- THE FILTERS ONCE THE LIAM AS A ROLE MODELS WERE. PROBLEM JUST SEPARATE SHIP THAT RESPONSE AND- THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOT JUST AT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS WILL BE. ARE CONCERNED AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME. THE PROPOSAL FOR. OF THE BOARD BUT- I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT- I JUST WANT TO ALERT YOU TO THAT CONCERN AS IT EXISTS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM PROTIUM AND NON THANK YOU DOCTOR HILLS- FOR- STEPPING FORWARD. VOLUNTEERING TO. SIT ON THIS BOARD WHICH IS- AS YOU KNOW FULL VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT IN MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU BY STAFF IN EARLIER INTERVIEWS THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ALWAYS WITH ON THE- CONCEPT THAT YOU'RE THERE TO ENSURE THERE'S PATIENT SAFETY AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL ON TOP OF AND CERTAINLY I MEAN TOP OF OUR PRIORITY LIST. BUT A YEAR AGO I ASKED THE MEDICAL BOARD APPOINTEES ABOUT THE NEED TO CREATE A PROCESS BY WHICH PEOPLE CONTRACT THE PROXY PROCESS OF THEIR COMPLAINTS AND WE WERE TOLD THE BOARD IS WORKING ON IT THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES TO US FREQUENTLY FROM OUR OUR DISTRICTS ARE WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY FILED A COMPLAINT AND THEY NEVER HEARD AND THEY HAVEN'T HEARD IT SAID RUSSELL COULD YOU UPDATE US ON THE ACTIONS THE BOARD. HAS TAKEN TO IMPROVE NOTIFICATION AND FRANKLY WHETHER ARE WE CAN COUNT ON AN ONLINE COMPLAINT TRACKING SYSTEM THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS OF STRONGLY THOSE WHO MADE COMPLAINTS- CAN CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE PROGRESS. OF THE REVIEW OF THEIR COMPLAINT. I THINK CENTER I TELL WE'RE NEVER AT EIGHT RELY THAT THE BOARD IS NOT ALWAYS DONE THE BEST POSSIBLE JOB IN KEEPING A CONSUMERS POSTED AT THE STATUS OF THEIR COMPLAINTS. I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER IN FUTURE- TO BOARD IS ACTIVELY DEVELOPING AN ONLINE COMPLAINT TRACKING SYSTEM. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S BEING DONE RIGHT NOW USING INTERNAL BOARD RESOURCES WHICH WILL MAKE THE PROCESS QUICKER HOPEFULLY WORTH IT AND PERHAPS LESS COSTLY- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WILL HEAR. AN UPDATE ON THE SYSTEM AT OUR NEXT BOARD MEETING WHICH IS NEXT WEEK- I DON'T HAVE ON THAT DATE AT WHICH THIS WILL BE GOING ONLINE BUT IT'S MY HOPE THIS WILL BE AN ONLINE. WEB WEB SYSTEM WORK CONSUMERS CAN LOOK UP. THE STATUS OF THEIR COMPLAINTS AND THEN BE ABLE TO ASK FOR EXPLORATION. AND THAT IS VERY NEWS FOR WE'LL WILL WILL HOPE THAT YOU AFTER THAT BOARD MEETING HALF WEEK YOU MIGHT. SEND A LITTLE NOTE AND SAY IF THAT WAS ONE OF THE AGENDA ITEMS THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY PROGRESS THERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WILL. GO A LONG WAY IN ENSURING THE ON. THE PUBLIC- OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THE ISSUES THAT BEEN RAISED ABOUT A MEDICAL BOARD ARE UNDER REVIEW AND THERE ARE REAL SERIOUS EFFORTS SIDE TO. ADDRESS THOSE AND RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINT SO WITHOUT I'M I'M OF. IN PRETTY SATISFIED LOOKING OUT TO CERTAINLY ON YOUR YOUR CORE ISSUES AND ALL YOUR GOALS. SO ARE YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR STEPPING UP AND SERVING ON THIS BOARD. HE'S THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR BECAUSE COMELEC OR- THANK YOU MANNA PRO TEM I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN DR FOR US SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME WITH ME THE OTHER DAY I'M AND- I THE SUNDERLAND ASKED- A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT. PROCESS IN COMPLAINTS AND I WON IT- DRILL DOWN ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH YOU I THINK WHEN I ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION LAST TIME I WASN'T CLEAR AND SO MY BAD ON THAT- HAVE THERE BEEN ANY INVESTIGATIONS. THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD- AND OFTEN TIMES. THE WELL I GUESS THAT'S JUST THE QUESTION. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK CONFIRM THAT WAS STAFF SENATOR- I BELIEVE THE BOARD DOESN'T MONITOR MEDIA STORIES AND HAS THE HAS THE OPTION TO DO SO- IF IT SOLD APPROPRIATE. OKAY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. LIKE GIFT. THAT'S A RARE THING OR NOT OR IF THAT'S A TOOL THAT YOU ALL. USE MORE FREQUENTLY. I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK WITH STEPHENSON OKAY. YOU KNOW THE OTHER QUESTION I ASKED WAS ABOUT- DRUGS ANNA AND THE OVER PRESCRIBING OF. NARCOTICS AND PAINKILLERS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT- ADDICTION AND OVER PRESCRIPTION. IS REAL I AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD SOME REALLY GOOD INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARED WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'D ASKED HAD TO DO WITH- THE MAKING SURE THAT FOSTER CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CARE AND ARE NOT BEING OVER PRESCRIBED. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE BOARD IS REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. RELATED TO PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS TO FOSTER CHILDREN AND SO- AND I SHARED WITH YOU REPORTS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY OWN COUNTY ABOUT YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AGES TWO AND THREE YEARS OLD ON COCKTAILS OF- NARCOTICS AND SO WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS AGAIN I KNOW YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO GET BACK TO ME ON THIS ON. HEY HOW THE MEDICAL BOARD IS WORKING WITH THE SS AND DH CS TO ENSURE THAT FOSTER CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CARE AND ARE NOT BEING OVER PRESCRIBED AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS HOW DO YOU THINK PHYSICIANS. YOU KNOW- RIVA PROVIDERS AND THEN ALSO PROVIDERS THAT ARE WORKING WITH STATE AND COUNTY- AGENCIES HOW SHOULD PHYSICIANS BE DISCIPLINED WHO ARE OVER PRESCRIBING. I THANK YOU SENATOR- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THE BOARD OF THE BOARD DOES NOT PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON ON ON THE DENTAL HIS LITTLE PRESCRIBING TO HAVE TWO CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- AND THE BOARD PLANS TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DH YES- TO CONFIRM THAT OUR PROCESSES ARE APPROPRIATE AND THEN MODIFIED MISLEAD- I THINK THAT WAS REGARDED IN INDIVIDUAL CASES IT'S IMPORTANT TO US. AND I WOULD WANT TO CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS THE TERM OF STANDS A KARAMAT CAN OF COURSE IF THEY'RE NOT MET THE BOARD TO TAKE ACTION ON THAT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY BOARD STAFF THAT SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE CONCERNS- ON THE BOARD OF. BEING UP PRESCRIBING IMPOSTER CHILDREN ON A THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- OF THOSE FIVE CASES THREE WERE INVESTIGATED AND THERE IS NO STANDARD OF CARE- REACH I DON'T FIVE- CASES- THERE IS NOT. OF CHRISTIAN TO OBTAIN RECORDS. BUT AGAIN DEEP PLANS TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE- AND TEACH S. T. L. PROCESS AND THIS NOT. THANK YOU THAT- THAT. THAT YOU ARE. KEEPING MY ALL OF SOME OF THESE. YOU KNOW THE FAR. YOUTH POPULATION IS. OFTEN REALLY OVERLOOKED- AND MAYBE THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SORT OF SHUFFLED THROUGH THE PROCESS AND END UP IN A HOME BUT HOW THEY'RE TREATED- IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHERE THEY END UP- AND SO AND WE DO NOT- IN MY COUNTY I DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES. WHERE YOUNG CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE ARE ON AS MANY AS FIVE- PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS- AND IN THAT HAS ALERTED A NUMBER OF FOLKS ABOUT HOW YOUNG CHILDREN ARE BEING CARED FOR WHILE THEY'RE TRYING TO BE SHEPHERD THROUGH A PROCESS AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW- ADOPTED FOR US SUCCESSFULLY FOSTERED AND THEN FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM. BUT YOU KNOW HAVE SUFFERED AN INJURY AND END UP BEING PRESCRIBE SOMETHING AND THEN GET ADDICTED TO IT- AND THEN THERE'S A CYCLE OF OVER PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEN WHEN THAT CEASES TO CONTINUE YOU KNOW THEY MAY FIND THEMSELVES I'M TRYING TO PURCHASE YOU KNOW NARCOTICS ILLEGALLY TO HELP HIM WITH THE PAIN AND THEN WE END UP WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN NOW WITH THAT NOW SO I DO ASK THAT YOU. WORK WITH THE BOARD TO RE ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- RIGHT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE GETTING A HANDLE ON FROM MANY DIFFERENT SIDES. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I DID WANT TO JUST SAY THAT THANK YOU MA'AM PROTON. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU A SENATOR KAMLAGER- AND THANK YOU DOCTOR OF FOR THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS AS FAR I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON- A COUPLE OF OUR INITIATED QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES- AND- AND TO ALSO SAY STAFF IS TRACKING THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK FOR RESPONSES TO AND WILL FOLLOW UP AS WE HAVE DONE. ON PREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS WITHOUT STANDING QUESTIONS- RELATED TO THE- TRACKING THE ONLINE TRACKING SYSTEM- I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY THAT CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH THE VICE CHAIR. WILL BE SOMETHING GREATLY NEEDED I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFITS- TO GO EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE THERE I THINK IT WAS JUST A HEARING LAST WEEK I DON'T KNOW MADAM VICE CHAIR ARE YOU ONE BMP AS WELL BUT YES. THERE WAS JUST ANOTHER HEARING AND THE SENATE LAST WEEK R. AND OBVIOUSLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL BOARD AND SOME MEMBERS WHO WORK ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE- WERE THERE TO RESPOND AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. I WOULD WOULD ASK IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE SENATOR LAYERS COMMENTS ABOUT. THIS THERE IS BECOME THIS LACK OF PUBLIC TRUST RELATED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND OBVIOUSLY. THE BOARD MEMBER SERVE- BECAUSE THEIR DESIRE TO- PARTICIPATE IN AND LOOK AT PUBLIC PROTECTION- AND THAT ROLE IS IMPORTANT AS YOU OUTLINED IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT- I WOULD ASK- IN TERMS OF THAT- THERE IS. NOT JUST A LACK OF ABILITY TO TRACK OR NOT BE COMMUNICATED BY THE BOARD WHEN A COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED. BUT BUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN PAST TESTIMONYIS THAT THE VOICE OF THE COMPLAINT TENS IS NO WE'RE IN THIS PROCESS WHEREAS IF YOU HAVE HEARINGS I THINK AND I KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS THERE'S THE PANELS AND- ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS. WE'RE IS THE VOICE OF THE COMPLAINT IT HEARD IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S DUE PROCESS AND A FOOT IF A DOCTOR HAS- A COMPLAINT AND HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THE DOCTORS VOICES THERE ARE SOMETIMES REPRESENTED BY MEDICAL EXPERTS FOR THE DOCTOR THE BOARD HAS MEDICAL EXPERTS THAT REVIEW. CASES WHERE IS THE VOICE OF THE COMPLAINT IT IN THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR- THE COMPLAINANT CERTAINLY IS INTERVIEWED BY THE COMMUNITY BY THE CENTRAL COMPLETE UNIT OF BY THE HEALTH ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS UNIT. AND THEIR STATEMENTS ARE ARE CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT WHEN DECIDING. WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE IN- THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS OR THE DUMPING OF ACCUSATION- IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE FOR THE PLAINTIFFS TO BE ASKED TO TESTIFY. ACT INDUSTRY HEARING BEFORE AN ALJ- SO THE COMPLAINANT IS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS TO THE EXTENT. TO YOUR TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE DOES A COMPLAINT AND SHE OUR COMPLAINT IS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT OUR- A HEARING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE CALLED AS A WITNESS THEY CAN DIAZ TESTIFIED THOSE HEARINGS YES. IS THERE A PROCESS WHEREBY IF THE COMPLAINT IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE THE COMMENTS I'VE HEARD TO DATE ARE THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY NO NOTHING UNTIL MAYBE THEY GET A LETTER AT THE VERY END OF THE PROCESS THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE. AND MAYBE THIS IS NOT IS IT MAYBE THIS THAT IS NOT THE SITUATION BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THERE IS NO POINT OR PROCESS OTHER THAN THE INITIAL COMPLAINT. UNLESS CONTACTED BY INVESTIGATOR FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS WHERE THEY HAVE ANY. PARTICIPANT TORY ROLE IN A THE EDUCATE AT YOU THE RESOLUTION OF THEIR COMPLAINTS SO YOU IS IT. WOULD MAYBE THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE BOARD HOW OFTEN DOES THE COMPLAINT AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. AFTER INITIAL- THE INITIAL COMPLAINT N. AND THE INVESTIGATOR IS THERE ANY POINT IN THE PROCESS WHERE THE COMPLAINT IT HAS THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMPLAINANTS DISSIPATION IS DEFINED IN THE LAW AND THAT- FOR EXAMPLE- HE INSTEAD OF THE PRESCRIPTION TO PRICKLY IS TO. IS TO ACT AS A WITNESS DURING HEARING IF THE IF REQUESTED BY THE- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR- OR OTHERS. SO IT'S THE IT'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT DETERMINES WHETHER THE COMPLAINT IT HAS A ROLE IN ANY HEARING. I BELIEVE SO YES OKAY IN- I NOTICED AND- THE BACKUP MATERIALS AT SOMEWHERE IT MENTIONS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PANELS- AND YOU'RE ON ONE OF THOSE PANELS THAT LOOKS AT CASES DO DO THE PANELS FOLLOW THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES MORE SPECIFICALLY- ON THE PROBATION PERIOD YOU'RE ON. YOUR ON A PANEL I REMEMBER OF HIM WILL BE A CENTER. OKAY SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RIVER THAT THE GUIDELINES OUR GUIDELINES AND THEY'RE NOT FINDING- AND THE GUIDELINES THEMSELVES STATE THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY- THE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SALAS- FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE- EVIDENTIARY PROBLEMS- THAT THE GUIDELINES STATE THAT THE- PHYSICIAN IS WILLING TO ACCEPT REHABILITATION. IN THIS PART OF THE PROCESS THAT WE MAY BE A REASON TO BUY TICKETS AT ONCE- THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME PLANS THAT SITUATIONS WHERE- AFTER THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. THAT HER ATTORNEY GENERAL FEELS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO MEET THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE STANDARD. YEAH AND SO THAT- WHEN WE ARE NEGOTIATING A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT- WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE THE ALLEGATION AND HEARING AND THE SETTLEMENT ALLOWS US TO IMPOSE SOME DISCIPLINE. THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A POSTER HERE. OKAY THANK YOU- THE ARM SO I DID I DID NOTICE THAT PANEL THERE ARE TWO PANELS ARE THERE MORE THAN TWO PANELS IS IT JUST THEIR TWO PANELS TWO PANELS AND FROM WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IN THE BACK OF MATERIALS- PANEL A- HAS YOUR OWN PANEL B. PANEL A HAS MORE PUBLIC MEMBERS PANEL B. HAS ARE MORE PHYSICIAN MEMBERS- I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW OFTEN IN THOSE PANELS. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT MAKE UP OF THE PUBLIC MAKE UP- MAJORITY ON ONE PANEL AND THE MEDICAL PHYSICIAN MAKE UP ON THE OTHER PANEL. THE HOW OFTEN OR HOW MANY CASES ARE ACTUALLY TAKEN OUT BY THE PANEL'S VERSES JUST BASICALLY. BOB IF YOU WILL APPROVED BASED ON THE- I GUESS IT IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RECOMMENDATION WHETHER YOU SORT OF JUST CONCUR WITH THAT AND YOU DON'T CONSIDER THE CASES ARE YOU ARE YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO HEAR THEM ANYWAY IS THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT I RECEIVED- AND- I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO MY EXPERIENCE ON CHANNEL B. I- I DON'T HAVE ANY INVOLVED WITH PANEL EIGHT I DO. FEEL THAT I REALLY CASES VERY CAREFULLY I CONSIDER THIS BUT OUR GUIDELINES FOR REACHING A DECISION AND CERTAINLY WANT TO CASES HELP FOR DISCUSSION I FEEL WHAT ARE OUR PANEL. IT HAS A VERY ACTIVE AND- HISTORY DISCUSSION AND- I THINK THAT OUR OUR OUTCOMES ARE. DECIDED APPROPRIATELY. I THANK YOU- I MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO LOOK AT THAT DATA BUT THAT MIGHT BE MORE IN THE VENUE OF THE BNP COMMITTEE SO ON I WILL. I WILL LEAVE IT IN THEIR JURISDICTION- I THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSES I DO REALLY APPRECIATE IT- OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IF NOT I WILL.

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE- PC PRESIDENT FORMER UC PRESIDENT MARIBEL BASHER. HER LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE WAS INVALUABLE- AS I NAVIGATED INITIALLY STANDING UP THE WILDFIRES EACH DIVISION AT THE P. C. AND THEN TRANSITIONING IT OVER INTO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY APRIL WELCOME ME AND THE ENTIRE OFFICE WITH OPEN ARMS INTO THE RESOURCES AGENCY FAMILY. AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU THE LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING LEGISLATION THAT CREATED IN IN INNOVATIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY REST. ARE YOUR VISION IS ENABLING US TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE HOW UTILITIES UNDERSTAND OUR WILDFIRE RISKS. AND PRIORITIZE THEIR EFFORTS TO REDUCE THAT RISK IN PURSUIT OF EVENTUALLY ELIMINATING UTILITY CAUSE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. OUR DEPARTMENT WAS BORN OUT OF TRAGEDY WITH ARE YOU WITH UTILITY COST BUYERS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER A HUNDRED DEATHS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOST HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND MORE THAN A MILLION AND A HALF ACRES BURNED IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS. UTILITIES MUST FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW THEY ADDRESS WILDFIRE RISK INHERENT IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. I'VE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS OF MY CAREER WORKING AT THE COUNTY AND THE STATE LEVEL. ON SOME OF THE STATE'S TOUGH FOR PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. MY PASSION IS PUBLIC SERVICE AND MAKING CALIFORNIA SAFER FOR EVERYONE. I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I WHICH ALLOWS ME TO FOCUS MY ENERGY ON A VERY SPECIFIC AND CRITICAL ISSUE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. AND PLACE MORE PART IN HELPING MAKE CALIFORNIA SAFER FOR OUR RESIDENTS. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK IF IT'S OKAY MADAM VICE CHAIR I'LL START WITH YOU. THANK YOU MADAM BROWN CHAIRMAN PRO TEM AND- THANK YOU DIRECTOR JACOBS FOR STEPPING FORWARD AND NOW I'M GETTING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. I DID READ THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE STATE AUDIT REPORT ON YOUR OFFICE AS WELL AS THE RESPONSES FROM THE AUDITOR TO YOUR REBUTTALS AND IT SEEMS THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. BETWEEN NOT FROM ALL THE I. S. AND CERTAINLY THE AUDITOR SO THAT'D BE GOOD TO GET YOUR ON YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROCESS. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN VERY ON I ENGAGE IN IN DEPTH AS A MATTER OF FACT HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE WORK TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE. THE WILDFIRE RISK- CERTAINLY IN THE PRESENT AND GOING FORWARD SO JUST LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THINGS LIKE IT WAS A LITTLE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN YOU AN AUDITOR ON WHETHER. THOSE THE- HE YEARS SORT. PROCESS AND HOLDING ON THE- UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH PERHAPS BUT BUT YOU COULD GET THE LIGHT NOW SIGN ON YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. COMPONENTS CERTAINLY GOING FORWARD AND FOR YOUR ROLE AND FOR THE ROLE OF ALL WE AYE OUT. WELL THANK YOU SENATOR- FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT I'D SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE WELCOME THE INPUT OF THE AUDITOR AND ALL THE INPUT WITH HAS A NEW DEPARTMENT WE'RE CONTINUALLY LEARNING. AND ITERATING ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS CREATED. TO OVERSEE UTILITY WILDFIRE SAFETY US SPECIFICALLY IT REGARDING THIS IS THE SORT OF A FICTION- THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION IS. VERY PRESCRIBED IN THE STATUTE THERE ARE SEVEN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MET- AN ARC OUR RESEARCH DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING. WHETHER THE UTILITIES NEEDS THOSE SEVEN SPECIFIC STATUTORY- CONDITIONS TO RECEIVE A SAFETY CERTIFICATION AND OUR UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEFT STATUTES IS THAT IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SIX CERTIFICATION IS TO ENCOURAGE. INVESTMENTS IN THE IN THE FUTURE IN SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND SEVEN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS THAT ARE LISTED- THAT MUST BE MET TOGETHER SAFETY CERTIFICATION ARE FOCUSED ON THOSE BOARDS- LOOKING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS- WE HAVE WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH. UTILITIES MUST BE. ALL OF FOR IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THEIR WILD FIRE SAFETY- COMMITMENTS THAT THEY MAKE IN THEIR OFFERING. AND HAVE AN ENTIRE DIFFERENCE DIVISION DOES THAT IT IS SEPARATE FROM THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROCESS. SO ARE COMPLIANCE DIVISION IS. FOCUSED ON DOING FIELD EFFECT AND SHE THAT THE. A MAN. WITH THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE IN THE WILDFIRE MANY PLANS THAT ARE ALSO. AND WE'VE DONE X. IN. AND MOVED OF THE ACTIONS THE BILL TO DATE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLANS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING A TWENTY TWO PLANTS. THANK YOU I GUESS WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE HEART OF MY QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THIS PARTICULAR. IF YOU BECAUSE THEY DID MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SOME THINGS I GUESS YOU HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT. IN MAY BE EXPLAINING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THEM OR THEIR SOME OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HE BELIEVED A LITTLE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE MOMENT TIME AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I SERVED ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. FOR MANY YEARS AND WE OFTEN HAVE- OF. AN AUDIT DONE AND YOU KNOW CRITIQUE BY THE GRAND JURY IS A MATTER OF FACT THAT SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AND PROCESS THESE IN WE WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND WHEN WE WERE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THEM OR WHAT. F. MORE WHAT I'M- GOING AFTER HERE. DO YOU BELIEVE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR ARE IMPLEMENTABLE. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME. THEY'RE A LITTLE BEYOND THE REACH. OR NOT ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR SO IF THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TWO OF THEM WERE TO OUR OFFICE AND ALSO BECAUSE THE ONE THAT WAS REGARDING SAFETY CERTIFICATION WAS A RECOMMEND A NATION. ACTUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE LEGISLATION WHAT THEY RECOMMENDED WAS ADDING AN ADDITIONAL CONDITION WITHIN THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS- ULTIMATELY. DEFER TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE WILL BE WILL WOULD IMPLEMENT WHATEVER THE LATEST LEGISLATURE CHOOSES. TO ACT- AND THE ADMINISTRATION- REGARDING THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION IN TERMS OF THE TO OUR AUDIT- RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR DEPARTMENT THERE WERE TWO ONE WAS FOR US TO- DETERMINE THE PRIEST PRESCRIBED. LEVEL OF SEVERITY ON A SPECIFIC TYPE OF ISSUE THAT WE WOULD FIND IN THE PLANS. ONE WAS FOR US. FURTHER INCORPORATE SOME OUTSIDE OF FINDINGS BY OTHER AGENCIES INTO THE WILD FOR MITIGATION PLAN CONTENT THE UTILITIES WITH SUBMITS ALL SPEAK TO THE FIRST ONE FIRST IN TERMS OF THE RICH PRIVATIZATION THEY WANTED US TO CONFIRM AND DESIGNATE RHYS PRIVATIZATION OF THE LEVEL OF SEVERITY OF WHAT WHAT WE CALL CRITICAL ISSUE- WE DID DISAGREE WITH SOMEONE NOT BE. ROOF FOR. THERE IN PARTICULAR ISSUE FOR ANYTHING THAT WE EVALUATE IN THE PLANS WHEN THE PLANS ARE REVIEWED BY AN EXTENSIVE TEAM OF EXPERTS ENGINEERS SCIENTISTS FIREFIGHTERS AND UTILITY POLICY EXPERTS AND THEIR- EXTREMELY TECHNICAL AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WOULD GO INTO THAT OF THAT COALITION SO WE TAKE OUR EACH PLAN AND DO AN EVALUATION OF THAT AND THEN- THIS THE EXPERTS IN JUDGMENT ON THE LEVEL OF SEVERITY OF WHATEVER PARTICULAR ISSUE THEY FIND- WE WOULD THEN. L. U. H. I INCORPORATE RISK PRIORITIZATION EXTENSIVELY THROUGH OUR EVALUATION OF THE PLANS THAT ALREADY EXISTS TODAY AND HAS EXISTED FOR IT SINCE TWENTY TWENTY IN TERMS OF THE SECOND EVALUATION OUR SECOND RECORD. IN TERMS OF LESSONS LEARNED WE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE PLANS A SECTION WHERE THE UTILITIES MUST RESPOND TO LESSONS LEARNED AND WE CONSTANTLY- OF ALL THINGS THOSE WHAT WE REQUIRE IN THOSE AFTER WE ARE. IN LOOKING IN BRING THEIR RECOMMEND. REGARD HEALTH AND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE GUIDELINES WORK TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE BILL'S RESPONSES I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT FLOOR DO YOU HAVE TO. ON TO MAKE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE WORK. YOU KNOW ON THE STRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW- ENFORCEMENT ACTION EIGHT FINE WHATEVER IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY OR IS THAT WHERE YOU NEED LEGISLATION. REDUCE WE DO HAVE THAT YEAH NOW UP THE CLERK THAT WAS NOT HARD. AUDIT'S FINDINGS WE DO ALL HAVE A REPEAT ISSUE NOTICES OF DEFECT AND NOTICES OF VIOLATION WHEN WE FIND- SOME TYPE OF. ISSUE WHEN WE'RE DOING INVESTIGATIVE AND OR AUDITS- IT WE'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY ISSUED MULTIPLE NOTICES OF DEFECT IN VIOLATION AND HAVE FOUND OVER FIVE HUNDRED DEFECTS ISSUE. IN TERMS OF THE CIVIC CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY DIRECTED THEM TO CORRECT IT- AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY DOING THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY TO BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT MAKE A RECOMMENDATION OVER TO THE COMMISSION. FOR PUT PEDAL TEAM ACTION ARTIST DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY HAVE AND ALL THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. I THINK ONE LAST QUESTION GOES TO WHAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR RESPONSES REGARDING STATUTORY CHANGES YOU FEEL ARE NECESSARY TO FOR YOU TO CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE. LEGISLATIVE IS THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED BUT ANY SPECIFIC THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH OFF HOURS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET BACK WHOLE. A NEW ONE. RISK THAT THE YOU'RE PREPARING TO SHARE OF WITH US GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES NEEDED TO GO TO I GIVE THOUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE REACH THAT YOU NEED TO RESPOND TO SOME ABOUT. THE ISSUES. THE AUDIT. YES SO THE- IMPLEMENTING THE TEN TEN FIFTY FOUR NEW REGULATORY FAVORS A VERY INNOVATIVE- IT'S BEEN TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING IT FIRST IS A LOT OF OUR STREETS DIVISION AND NOW IS THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WE ARE ACTUALLY THIS YEAR ONLY JUST NOW COMPLETING THE FIRST FULL CYCLE BASED ON THIS NEW INNOVATIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. SO WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTING THAT STATUE IN COMPLETING THAT FIRST THAT FIRST FULL CYCLE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GIVE IT TIME TO SEE IT SEE THE SUCCESS OF THE CURRENT INVICTA OSCAR THAT IS IN PLACE TODAY- CERTAINLY IF WE IDENTIFY ANY OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE WORKING THROUGH THE NORMAL CHAIN CHANNELS AND ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WELL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ANSWERS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ARE YOU GOT A BIG JOB IN FRONT OF YOU SO THANK YOU AGAIN FROM ALL THE WORK YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND ALL THE WORK YOU'VE ALREADY HAVE DONE THANK. PRECIADO THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEMAN I DON'T I ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WANTED TO JUST GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON- IF YOU THINK UTILITIES ARE MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING- THE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR. THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS I SUFFICIENT AS IT IS AND MAY BE PUSHING TOO FAR WE NEED TO MOVE THEY NEED TO MOVE FASTER- AND BE SMARTER AND HOW THEY DO IT- THE REALITY IS THE RISK IS CONTINUING TO BUILD WITHIN OUR THE LANDSCAPE AND WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE THERE ARE MANY ACTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING FULLY AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO THAT. THEY HAVE MADE PROGRESS THOUGH IF YOU GO BACK THREE YEARS AGO- MOST OF THE UTILITIES DIDN'T HAVE AN AWAY TO FULLY ASSESS WHERE THEIR RISK WHAT. WE CALL THE WILDFIRE RISK MODELS- THE NOW THEY DO SO THEY'VE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS TO THE HOUSE THE SERIOUSLY SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE- A BIG BUILD OUT MORE SOPHISTICATED- CAPABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE RISK IS. AND THEY'D BE GONE THEY'VE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED BUT THEY'VE BEGUN TO CHANGE HOW THEY DO THEIR JOBS HOW THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS HOW THEY BUILD HOW THEY OPERATE AND HOW THEY MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT RISK. IT WILL TAKE A LOT TO GET IT ALL DONE THEY NEED MORE TIME AND THEY NEED MORE RESOURCES TO DO IT- BUT THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THEY NEED TO MOVE FASTER IN THE SUMMER. AND YOU'RE UNION IF- WE S. REVIEW OR SIR. ONE OR VARIOUS TRANSMISSION LINES AND THEN SOMETHING GOES SIDEWAYS. DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UTILITY. JUST TO CLARIFY WE DO NOT CERTIFY TRANSMISSIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE IS ALSO THE- FEDERAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THOSE AND THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN US AND THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION STILL. OWNS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE AUTHORITY TO SET THE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS- THAT THESE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT ON- BUT I TO YOUR POINT THOUGH IN TERMS OF WHEN WE GO OUT THERE AND DO INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON ARE THEY IMPLEMENTING THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN ACTIVITIES THAT THEY ARTICULATED AND WERE APPROVED IN ANY PLAN THAT WE APPROVED- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY. TAKE AWAY OR REDUCE THEIR LIABILITY- TO OPERATE THE GRID SAFELY- ALTERNATELY- ANY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAUSES AN IGNITION WOULD STILL BEAT UP PROCESS THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S WORK- WHILE THE PUBLIC SAFETY OR PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION'S WILDFIRE INVESTIGATION PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE- REASONABLENESS OR NEGLIGENCE THAT THEY HAD. FOR HOW THAT TECHNICIAN HAPPENS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATORS LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME I REALLY. APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF THE THINGS I WANT WANTED TO GET AT BUT I STILL HAVE SORT OF THE QUESTION THAT IS CENTRAL TO OUR CONVERSATION WHICH IS. YOU HAVE THE PRESCRIBED MEASURES IN THE LAW. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SAFETY PLANS AND TRYING TO. JUDGE THAT THEY'RE BEING MATT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS ACTUALLY LEADS TO WHAT THE POLICY GOALS OR IT BECAUSE WE ARE WE CONFIRM PEOPLE FOR DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND I JUST HAVE. THEIR WROTE PROCESSES AND THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESSES AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOOD AND AT SOME POINT TO NAY FORGET SOMETIMES THAT THEY'RE CONNECTED TO ACTUAL OUTCOMES SO AND I KNOW ALSO THAT YOU'VE CHANGED AGENCIES I THINK YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF OVER TWO YEARS TRIPLING YOUR STAFF I KNOW THAT THIS IS A MOVING TARGET. ARE BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING AT THE PROBLEM THAT THIS OF THESE PLANS IN THIS AGENCIES FORM TO ADDRESS. ALL THANK YOU SENATOR- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT DO WE CHANGE THE OUTCOMES ARE WE IMPROVING SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA- IT COMES DOWN TO. ARE WE NOT HAVING MISSIONS BASED ON UTILITY COST INFRASTRUCTURE- ISSUES SO I TELL HIM ALL THE TIME OUR JOB BOILS DOWN TO. SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SPARKS THAT TURN INTO IGNITIONS FROM ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN ELIMINATING THE SPARKS THE TURN INDIGNATION THAT POTENTIALLY TURN INTO CATASTROPHIC FIRES- SO TO ME THAT'S THE END GOAL AND WE WHAT WE MONITOR THAT VERY CLOSELY. SO WE MONITOR EVERY DAY THE IGNITION RATES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE- INTERNET UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE STANDING UP THE DEPARTMENT WOMAN MOVED OVER FROM THE COMMISSION IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. IS WE IMPLEMENTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO OBVIOUSLY RUN OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE REQUIRE THE UTILITIES TO SUBMIT TO US- IGNITION REPORTS. EVERY TIME THEY HAVE A TECHNICIAN- THEY HAVE TO TELL THEM TELL US ABOUT IT AND WE TRACK THAT AND THE GOAL HERE IS FOR US TO SEE A TREND LINE DOWN IN THE NUMBER OF IGNITIONS. AND ELIMINATION OF IGNITIONS THAT CASH FIRES SO THAT IS OUR IN GAME THAT WE MONITOR REALLY CLOSELY EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE DO. HAVE TO DRIVE THAT NUMBER GO DOWN. THEN ME THE CHAIR OF. ASK YOU ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE NOT SO YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND YOU REALIZE ALL THE THINGS YOU WERE GIVEN IN THE LEGISLATION OR THE THINGS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED IN THE PLANTS. DON'T GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS THAT REALLY GET IT THIS ARE YOU A POWER TO COME TO US AND SAY WE REALLY NEED TINKERING WITH THE LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE REAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS US TO COMPLETELY GET IT THIS. AND MAYBE THAT'S A DUMB QUESTION I WS I HAD A MINOR ROLE IN THAT AGENCY AND I DON'T THINK WE WERE FOR POWER TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT CHECKING WITH FIVE PEOPLE. BUT BUT NEVER. BUT NEVER THE LESS I MEAN WOULD THAT BE A GOAL THAT YOU TRY TO WORK IT THROUGH THE CHAIN TO CALM AND MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX SOMETHING THAT THAT GIVES YOU A TOOL THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD. I KNOW THAT I HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF ON BOTH THE AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING OUR JOB AND IF THAT MEANS HAVING DISCUSSIONS- TO TALK ABOUT. FUTURE CHANGES. THROUGH THE PROPER PROPER CHANNELS- ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD WE WOULD DO THAT- EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE THAT WHAT WE MUST TO DO. IS TO CHANGE HOW THE UTILITIES ARE BUILDING OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THEIR GRADE TO AVOID FUTURE FIRES- SO I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT I KNOW WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THERE- AND YOU. I CAN CERTAINLY- TELL YOU THAT THAT'S MY JOB IS I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO. I WILL CONSIDER MYSELF SUCCESSFUL IN THIS ROLE IN LESS WERE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION- JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU NEED THE ENCOURAGEMENT. IS THE ARM. AND DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY AS THE SITUATION CHANGES I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE P. GENIES ANNOUNCED THEY WANT TO SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO UNDERGROUND. WHAT'S JUST SAY THEY WERE REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND ONE OF THAT. ARE DOES THAT MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO THAN REALLY A MENTOR TO ADDED SAFETY PLANS BECAUSE- THE WHOLE PROCESS IS BASED ON WHAT THE CURRENT SITUATION IS OF POWER LINES AND WHAT'S ABOVE GROUND TO MEET. HOW WILL. WHAT YOU DO MOVE WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED IN THE INDUSTRY OR ON THE GROUND QUESTION THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION I THINK IT'S THE BEAUTY IN THE WAY THAT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WAS SET UP THROUGH. THE CREATED IT- AND I SAID I WILL CERTAINLY WASN'T A PART OF THAT BUT I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- FLEXIBILITY IN THE FOR SIDE THAT THEY HAD IN CREATING THAT FRAMEWORK SO BECAUSE IT IS AN ANNUAL ITERATIVE PROCESS. EVERY YEAR WE ARE INFORMING AND ADJUSTING AND CHANGING BASED ON BOTH WHAT THAT HAVE LITERALLY THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED AS WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NEEDS HAVE CHANGED- ARE CHANGING SO WE ACTUALLY A PRETTY DYNAMIC PROCESS- TO BE ABLE TO. FEED IN TO OUR GUIDELINES THAT WE DEVELOP- FOR THE UTILITIES. POST TO SUBMIT PLANS AND WHAT IS ALL THE CONTENT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE- AS WELL AS OUR EVALUATION PROCESS. SO THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS BUT THEY PROVIDE US AN UPDATE EVERY YEAR SO THAT PROCESS IS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED HERE FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS. K. F. I JUST APPRECIATE OF THE EXCHANGE AND I KNOW. NO RESOURCES AGENCY HAS WHOLE BUNCHES OF PLANTS AND LAST YEAR I DID A BILL TO PUT THE PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FIRE GOALS INTO A PLAN AND MAKE IT ADAPTIVELY MANAGED OVER FIVE YEARS HE COULD REALLY- NO THAT THAT THOSE GOALS ARE GOALS THAT HAVE TO BE REALIZED AND THAT YOU COULD GET AT THEM AS- THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND CHANGE. AND SO I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER AND FOLLOWING THIS BECAUSE- YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLE WORK AND I KNOW I HAVE A DISTRICT. THAT IS HEAVILY PRONE TO FIRE AND- R. AND A AND THE ONE THAT I WAS PACKED AND READY TO GO ON A SEXUAL LIGHTNING FIRE IN A LIGHTNING STORM WAS NOT DUE TO A- TO A POWER COMPANY BUT- I WAS SECRETARY. AT THE TIME OF THE PARADISE FIRE AND OTHER ONES THAT WERE REALLY. I THINK HAVE DRIVEN HOME THE NEED FOR YOUR AGENCY AND THE REASON THAT SO MANY POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED SO I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU DO. VERY IMPORTANT WORK THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO SERVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- ARE I LOVE A LOT OF GROUND COVERED ALREADY. I ONLY HAVE ONE I THINK FAIRLY SIMPLE QUESTION- IN TERMS OF- THE THIS MOVING INTO- E. I. S. N. RELATED TO THE APPROVAL OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. PRIOR UNDER THE C. P. U. C. THERE WAS AN INTERVENER BOB KIND OF ROLE HOW DO CONSUMERS ARE BEST GET ACROSS OF THEIR INTEREST OR CONCERNS IN THIS REVIEW PROCESS NOW WHAT WHAT IS THAT PROCESS AND DO YOU FEEL. GOOD ABOUT IT BE AN ADEQUATE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS I KNOW SOME OF THE STUFF IS PRETTY COMPLEX IT'S WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THERE WAS A WHOLE INTERVENOR. PROCESS FOR SOMEONE TO BE PAID TO REPRESENT INTERESTS BUT HOW DO YOU VIEW IT IN YOUR ROLE NOW. ON THE REVIEW OF THOSE PLANS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO WE'VE FOR THE MOST PART HE CAN THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE HAD OVER THE COMMISSION. AND REPLICATED UNDER THE UNDER THE NEW DEPARTMENT SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE CAN WILL RECEIVE STAKEHOLDER COMMENT WHETHER THAT'S GENERAL PUBLIC OR INTERVENORS FOLKS THAT ARE- THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY THANK YOU CAN GAUGE ON THE COMMISSION'S PROCEEDINGS- SO THERE'S STILL A PROCESS FOR THEM TO DO THAT. WE DO PUBLIC WORKSHOPS- WE ACCEPT PUBLIC COMMENT WE ACCEPTED- COMMENT ON BOTH THE PLANS AS WELL AS OUR EVALUATIONS OF THE PLANS- WE'VE ALSO REPLCATED- ON OUR WEBSITE A PROCESS TO READ RECEIVE ALL OF THIS SO THERE'S AN ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM- SO FOR THE MOST PART. IT'S NOT EXACTLY A DUPLICATION OF HOW THE PHYSICIAN HAS IT- BUT WHERE WHERE WE COULD WE KEPT THAT SAME STRUCTURE IN PLACE OF THE SIX THREE RULING IMPORTANT TO US TO CONTINUE TO GET. EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS- PARTICULARLY THE INTERVENORS FROM THAT HAVE COME WITH US FROM THAT THE COMMISSION ON THAT ARE DEEPLY TECHNICAL EXPERTS IN THIS AREA TO GET THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY HELP US THEY HELP OUR EVALUATION BE RICHER AND FULLER- SO WE'VE WE'VE CONTINUED THAT PROCESS. AND THE STATUTE WITH AUTHORITIES THAT CAME OVER IN THE NEW EXPERTISE WE GOT WHEN WE BECAME THE DEPARTMENT IT REQUIRES THAT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS ALSO WE ARE CERTAINLY IMPLYING THAT TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT- BUT- SOMETIMES GOING EVEN ABOVE AND BEYOND. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING GOOD AYE GOOD COMMENTS GOOD FEET TO FEET TO ROBUST. AS IT. ALWAYS SEEMINGLY HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE FOR YEAR THE WE OF HER THROUGH THE- LESIONS ON THE PLAN EVALUATIONS. HOLY AS OUR OWN DEPARTMENT RIGHT LAST YEAR IN THE SPRING WE ARE STILL PART OF THE COMMISSION. US SO THAT PROCESS CITY YEAH. YEAH SO I WOULD SAY THAT- WE CERTAINLY ARE STILL SEEING ENGAGEMENT- I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE OF IT A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF AND WE MAY HAVE HAD SOME PEOPLE CHANGE- I KNOW THE LAST PUBLIC WORKSHOP THAT WE HAD. A WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE- IT FROM THE PUBLIC FROM STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGED IN THAT WORKSHOP WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A PRETTY ROBUST SHOWING- AND SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD WHEN WE WERE AT THE COMMISSION- SO I'VE NOT SEEN THAT DROP OFF. BUT IT IS STILL IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THAT UNDERSTOOD WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT TRANSITIONS OVER TIME AND I'M SURE WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN VARIOUS HEARINGS AND- ARE.
