LIKE TO CONVENE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. RESPONSE IN PREVENTION -- WELCOME EVERYBODY -- TODAY OUR AGENDAS SHORT BUT MEATY ARM OR WE'RE GOING TO BEGINNING TO BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION. OF THE RESULTS OF OUR WORKPLACE CLIMATE SURVEY -- A FROM TALON KEEPERS OUR VENDOR AND IT'S OF I'M SURE GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING FOR US TO SEE HOW OUR EMPLOYEES. I'M FROM ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE FOR IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM DISTRICT STAFF TO PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET. NO LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BUILDINGS FEEL ABOUT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WORK AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING ON TO THE PROPOSAL FOR A RECOMMENDATION OF FOR THE RECOMMEND HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE CHANGES IN OUR POLICY DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE -- FOR THAT -- I SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL OR VICE CHAIR AND SENATE REPRESENTATIVE AND MYSELF WILL PRESENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL OF YOU. FOR YOUR FEEDBACK -- AND YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND AGAIN NEXT WEEK TWO THIRDS THURSDAY I'M SORRY ON THURSDAY WHICH WILL FEEL LIKE NEXT WEEK TO MANY OF US -- TO FORMALLY ADOPT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN SEND THEM OFF TO SENATE JOINT RULES. SO WITHOUT ANY DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS THEY'D LIKE TO MAKE BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE CLIMATE SURVEY. ALRIGHT WITHOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING TO CHRISTOPHER MULLIGAN IS THE CEO OF TALENT KEEPERS [inaudible] WELCOME. DATING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND BUILDING A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE WILL REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY. AND REVIEW SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A FAIR ACCEPTING AND OPEN CULTURE THAT WOULD BE FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT. WE WANT A MEASURE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE IDENTIFY STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEN RECOMMEND SOME ACTIONS TO IMPROVE CLIMATE AND REDUCE INSTANCES OF REPORTED HARASSMENT. THE MODEL HERE REPRESENTS WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS US OUR THE COUNTRY CONTRIBUTORS. TO A CLIMATE THAT EITHER FAIR AND OPEN OR ONE OF HARASSMENT AND WE HAVE OUR DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WHICH WOULD BE. GENDER AGE ETHNICITY OR SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT WE HAVE OUR OCCUPATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN TERMS OF ARE YOU IN A SUPERVISORY ROLE NON SUPERVISORY ROLE. THE LOCATION IN WHICH YOU WORK AND THEN WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE AND THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT WE CAN CONTROL. AND WAS THE PURPOSE OF OUR SURVEY. AND ONE WERE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THAT CLIMATE WE CAN REDUCE THAT CULTURE AND WE GET ALL THE BENEFITS AT THE BOTTOM IN TERMS OF ITS SATISFACTION OF OUR EMPLOYEES -- COMMITMENT TO THE ORGANIZATION THEIR HEALTH THEIR ENGAGEMENT. SO THIS IS A MODEL THAT WE'VE CREATED A TALENT KEEPERS OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS. TO CHAU THE DRIVERS UP ENGAGEMENT. AND WE MEASURED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH ONE OF THESE DRIVERS AND OUR CLIMATE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES PARTS CLIMATE SURVEY OF YOUR EMPLOYEES -- CREDIBLE LEADERSHIP. IS A LEADER THAT I CAN TRUST TWO IS A GOOD COMMUNICATOR. WHO TREATS ME LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL SOMEONE WHO I THINK HAS MY BACK IF I NEED SUPPORT I CAN GO TO THAT LEADER GET THAT SUPPORT? SUPPORTIVE CO WORKERS I WANT TO WORK WITH LIKE MINDED PEOPLE IF I'M GIVING A HUNDRED AND 10% I WANT TO WORK WITH OTHERS WHO WERE DOING THE SAME. JOB AND CAREER SATISFACTION Y. DOING WORK THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME THAT I THINK I'M GOOD AT AND IS THERE A PATH FORWARD FOR ME WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND LASTLY A HIGH PERFORMING ORGANIZATION AN ORGANIZATION I'M PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BUT I BELIEVE IS DOING GOOD WORK SO THE SO THE DRIVERS. OF EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND AT THE BOTTOM WE GET ALL THESE BENEFITS OF COURSE THIS MODEL WAS DEVELOP VERY BROADLY -- SO IN TERMS OF YOUR OUTCOMES WILL BE DIFFERENT DUDE THERE'S NO PROFITABILITY OBVIOUSLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. UMPS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES. NOW WHAT WE WANTED TO REALLY FOCUS ON ARE THE ELEMENTS IN THAT HIGH PERFORMING ORGANIZATION DRIVER. THAT REALLY CREATE A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE SO WE CREATED ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT WOULD FOCUS ON THAT PARTICULAR ELEMENT. THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED. FROM APRIL EIGHTEENTH THROUGH MAY ELEVENTH OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY ONE ELIGIBLE. OF RESPONDENTS THAT INCLUDED ALL BENEFITS ELLA TOLD POLICE LEGISLATURE'S VOLUNTEERS AND INTERNS. AND OVERALL WE HAD A PARTICIPATION RATE OF 46%. DO YOU USE SOME BENCHMARKS IN A SURVEY OF THIS TYPE WHICH IS AN ANONYMOUS SURVEY OF CONTENT THAT IS SENSITIVE. WE COULD EXPECT PARTICIPATION RATES BETWEEN THIRTY AND 50%. SO TO BE AT 46% OF THE TOP END OF THAT RANGE. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. BUT GOOD PARTICIPATION GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SURVEY. SO HERE THE FIVE ELEMENTS THAT WE LOOKED AT IN THE SURVEY. AND WE'VE RANKED ORDERED THEM FROM STRONG GUEST TO LOWEST. SO CO WORKER ENGAGEMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE STRONGEST DRIVER OF ENGAGEMENT WE THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE GOING FORWARD. AND THE BENCHMARKS THAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT ARE OUR GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK THESE ARE NOT ALL. PUBLIC SERVICE BENCHMARKS ARE ARE. ENTITIES THAT GO TO THAT GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK ARE NOT ALL LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY VERY GENERAL -- BUT YOU CAN SEE YOUR WELL ABOVE THAT GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK WHICH IT'S AT 69% SO 83%. OF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGE WHETHER CO WORKERS. SECOND IS LEADERSHIP. THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR IS A REAL STRENGTH FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- THEY BELIEVE THAT LEADER IS TRUSTING CONCERNED ABOUT THEM -- AGAIN. AS A COMPARISON TO THE GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS BELOW. THE GOVERNMENT TARGET. SEVENTY TWO JOB AND CAREER ENGAGEMENT WE SAID 62% -- AGAIN A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE THE BENCHMARK THAT WE HAVE -- WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE EACH ONE OF THESE DRIVERS IN THE ENSUING SLIDES. AND THEN ORGANIZATIONAL ENGAGEMENT REALLY BEGINS TO DROP OFF AND AGAIN THAT'S WHERE WE TYPICALLY SEE FAIR INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS FALLING INTO THAT AREA SO JUST 40%. OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE ENGAGED BY THE ORGANIZATIONAL DRIVER AND FINALLY THE FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE ELEMENT WAS EVEN LOWER. AT 36% FAVORABLE. SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY IN THE BOTTOM TWO AREAS AND YOU CAN SEE WE DON'T HAVE A BENCHMARK FOR THE FAIR INCLUSIVE CLIMATE. ELEMENT THAT WAS UNIQUE. TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THERE ARE SOME STRENGTHS LET'S BEGIN WITH THOSE. EMPLOYEES ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK DUTIES AND ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE. 70% OF THEM ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR WORK SATISFACTION. I GENERALLY IS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL IN TERMS OF THE LOCATION IN WHICH I WORK OUT THAT THE THINGS THAT I'M WORKING ON THE NATURE OF MY WORK. ENGAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I WORK MY CO WORKERS BY LEADER. OF THE PEOPLE THAT I INTERACT WITH -- BUT OUTSTANDING THAT'S A REAL STRENGTH FOR THE LEGISLATURE. JOB DUTIES WERE CITED AS THE NUMBER ONE REASON EMPLOYEES ARE STAYING IN THEIR ROLES THEY LOVE THEIR WORK. 78% OF EMPLOYEES INDICATE THE AND TEND TO STAY WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE AND THAT IS REMARKABLE. IN OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AT RECORD LOWS THREE POINT 9% -- WE ARE NOT SEEN THAT TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OTHER INDUSTRIES OUR TURNOVER IS INCREASING. AND SO THAT IS A VERY LONG TENURED OUTLOOK FOR YOUR RESPONDENTS. AND LASTLY EMPLOYEES ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS AND BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. SO REAL STRENGTHS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AN ADDITION I MENTIONED AT THE DRIVER SLIDE THAT THERE IS A REAL STRENGTH OF CO WORKERS AND LEADERS SO 83% OF EMPLOYEES ARE ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS -- WE THINK AGAIN THIS IS ELEMENT THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE IN AS PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND 70% WERE ENGAGED BY THE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR. OVER 80% OF THEM. BELIEVE THEIR SUPERVISORS TRUSTWORTHY CARING AND LISTENS TO IDEAS SO ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE TO INCREASE THAT FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE. IN TERMS OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL SECURE IN THEIR JOBS AND DO NOT FEEL RESPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO ONLY 55% OF EMPLOYEES BELIEVE INDIVIDUALS IN POSITION OF POWER SUPPORT. I HARASSMENT FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT. 38% DO NOT BELIEVE VICTIMS OR REPORTERS OF HARASSMENT ARE FREE FROM RETALIATION AND JUST A THIRD 33% TO NOT BELIEVE APPROPRIATE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. AFTER A COMPLAINT IS MADE SO THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES HERE -- TO CHANGE THOSE PERCEPTIONS. AND OF THOSE TO INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED OR WITNESSED HARASSMENT. FEMALES REPORTED HIGHER INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT THAN MEN. THE PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL WHO REPORT HARASSMENT IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF NON SUPERVISED IN SOME CASES DOUBLE THE RATE OF REPORTING. HOWEVER BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE NON SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES. THAT THE NUMBER THAT REPORTED HARASSMENT IN THE NON SUPERVISORY ROLE IS GREATER. THE MOST PREVALENT INDICATION OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM INTERACTIONS WITH LOBBYISTS OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND CAPITAL EMPLOYEES REPORTED HIGHER INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT THAN THOSE LOCATED IN THE TO SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT EACH ONE OF THOSE DRIVERS AND THE ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE THEM -- AGAIN BE INDEX OVERALL FOR ORGANIZATION ENGAGE WAS AT 40% SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE ASSEMBLY THEN THE SENATE. AND HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT COMPRISE THAT. SO ONE ELEMENT OF THE CALCULATIONS HERE IS THE TRUTH OVERALL ENGAGEMENT INDEX IS NOT AN SIMPLE AVERAGE OF THE ITEM SCORES -- SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S BELOW US ITEM SCORES 44% OF THE INDEXES FORTY THE MATH TO DO THAT IS IS AT THE BOTTOM WE LOOK AT EACH RESPONDENT. AND OF THEIR AVERAGE RATING ON A FIVE POINT SCALE OF AGREEMENT WHERE FIVE TO STRONGLY AGREE. IS THREE DOT SIX FIVE OR HIGHER THEY'RE DEEMED TO BE ENGAGED SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MATH BETWEEN THE OVERALL INDEX. AND THE PERCENTAGES NEXT TO THE ITEMS THE ITEMS INDICATE THE PERCENTAGE. OF RESPONDENTS HAD AGREED WITH EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS OR STRENGTH IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATES. DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC IS A HIGH PRIORITY WITH 69% OF RESPONDENTS AGREEING TO THAT. MANAGERS ARE ACCESSIBLE APPROACHABLE. 64% AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FALL BELOW THE 50% RATE WERE LESS THAN HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS AGREED WITH THE STATEMENT SO ONLY 49%. AGREED THE LEGISLATURE SHOWS RESPECT FOR EMPLOYEES. 45% I FEEL I CAN QUESTION THE POLICY. FOR PRACTICE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING PENALIZED AND 44%. BELIEVE THAT THEIR EMPLOYERS PROCESSED AND PROCEDURES TO EVALUATE AND PROMOTE EMPLOYEES IS FAIR. SO THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITIES AREAS THERE. YOU FEEL THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO NOW. WELL NEXT INDEX OR DRIVER IS THE JOB AND CAREER ENGAGEMENT INDEX LEGISLATURE A LITTLE STRONGER FOR THE ASSEMBLY THEM THE SENATE IN. THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE. 78% BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY. PERFORM THEIR JOBS EFFECTIVELY. INFORMATION RESOURCES NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY GET THEIR WORK DONE. TWO THIRDS 67% BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE TRAINING NEEDED TO PERFORM THEIR JOBS EFFECTIVELY. AND 54% BELIEVE THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH. THOSE DATA ARE VERY CONSISTENT ON THE PROFESSIONAL GROWTH SIDE OF WHAT WE SEE NATIONALLY -- MOST EMPLOYEES WHO LEAVE THEIR EMPLOYERS TODAY ARE LEAVING FOR CAREER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES -- NOT NAY CHAU YOUR PROMOTION AND A RAISE BUT GROWING SKILL SET ON EXPERIENCE SO YOUR DATA ARE VERY CONSISTENT [inaudible] WITHOUT FINDING. THE CO WORKER INVASION INDEX 83% OVERALL IN GAUGE WHETHER CO WORKERS HERE THE SENATE. HELLO HIGH HIGHLY A HIGHER LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT. SO 84% OF EMPLOYEES BELIEVE THEIR CO WORKERS COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY -- THEY'VE RECEIVED THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AND THEY DEMONSTRATE INTEREST AND CONCERN FOR MY PERSONAL WELL BEING. SO AGAIN THIS IS A STRENGTH OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE BELIEVE YOU CAN LEVERAGE GOING FORWARD TO INCREASE THAT FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE -- AND FINALLY THE LEADER ENGAGE AN INDEX 70% ARE ENGAGED BY THEIR LEADERS SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE SENATE ON THE ASSEMBLY -- YOU BEGIN BEGIN AT THE TOP WITH FEELING THAT THEIR SUPERVISOR SOMEONE THEY CAN TRUST. 82% AGREED WITH THAT THEY LISTEN WHEN THEY HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER. OTHER CONCERN FOR ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL THESE ARE ALL VERY STRONG ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY REQUIRED AND AND MUST BE PRESENT FOR ENGAGEMENT AND A FAIR INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT -- THEY FEEL THAT THEIR SUPERVISOR HOLDS THEM AND THEIR CO WORKERS APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE THAT DRIVES A LOT OF TRUST -- 76% BELIEVE THEIR SUPERVISOR PROVIDES FEEDBACK THAT CAN HELP THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE. 75%. FEELS THEIR SUPERVISOR. HELPS THEM FEEL EMPOWERED INCREASE IN VIOLENT WHERE THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS. 73% BELIEVE THEY CLEARLY COMMUNICATE EXPECTATIONS AND THE REASONS BEHIND CHANGING PRIORITIES. AS 72% BELIEVE THAT THEIR SUPERVISORS AWARE OF GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE WORKPLACE IN RESPONSE APPROPRIATELY. IT'S ALL VERY STRONG ELEMENTS. AND THEN ARE FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE INDEX 36% [inaudible] ENGAGEMENT. STRONGER FOR THE ASSEMBLY THEN THE SENATE BY TEN POINTS OUR BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. BEGINNING AT THE TOP -- THEIR EMPLOYERS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION POLICY. 72% ARE AWARE OF THE COMPLAINT PROCESS. AND THAT WE BEGIN TO DEPART FROM THOSE VERY STRONG NUMBERS 255% BELIEVE INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF POWER SUPPORT HARASSMENT FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT. 54% BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO STAFF REGARDLESS OF MEMBERSHIP AND PROTECTED CLASSES. 40% BELIEVE THAT IF THEY REPORT HARASSMENT WITH A WITNESS IT OR EXPERIENCE IT THEMSELVES. BY FOLLOWING THE COMPLAINT PROCESS THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. AND 39% ARE CONFIDENT THAT IF THEY REPORT HARASSMENT WITNESSED OR EXPERIENCED THERE WOULD BE NO RISK OF RETALIATION. FOR THEMSELF FOR THE VICTIM. THE LAST ITEM WE WANT A LOWER SCORE AND THAT IS I'VE HEARD OTHERS MAKE JOKES OF WORK ABOUT PROTECTED CLASS. SO JUST 34% AGREED WITH THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD WANT. WE HAVE ONE OTHER ELEMENT BEFORE LOOK AT RECOMMENDATIONS AND A VERY COMMON METRIC IN. INDUSTRY IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR EMPLOYEES. STAKEHOLDERS WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE AS A GOOD PLACE TO WORK TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. INSTALLED THE EMPLOYEE NET PROMOTER SCORE. AND IT'S THE ONE QUESTION THAT DID NOT USE A FIVE POINT SCALE OF AGREEMENT USED A TEN POINT SCALE. AND IF YOU RESPONDED ON THAT TEN POINT SCALE WORST TENNIS I STRONGLY AGREE. YOU WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A PROMOTER IF YOU READY THAT A NINE OR A TEN IF YOU RATED THAT A SEVEN OR EIGHT EIGHT YOU WERE DEEMED TO BE PASSIVE. AND SIX OR BELOW YOU WERE DEEMED TO BE A DETRACTOR. AND SO THE RANGE OFSCORES RANGES FROM NEGATIVE ONE HUNDRED TWO POSITIVE ONE HUNDRED OVERALL FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE RATE NEGATIVE THREE YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS. OF DETRACTORS PASSIVES AND PROMOTERS -- THE GOAL IS TO BE AT THIRTY OR ABOVE. MODERATE IS CONSIDERED BETWEEN ONE AND THIRTY SO NOT. NOT ALL BAD NEWS THAT BAG OF THREE OF THE GOAL IS TO MOVE OUR PASSIVE TO PROMOTERS. SO THEY CAN WRITE THAT A NINE OR TEN AND OF COURSE SUCH A TRACTORS UP AS WELL. AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SENATE FOR THE USE. WHEN WE ASKED WHAT WOULD INCREASE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE'S GOOD PLACE TO WORK THE NUMBER ONE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED ISSUE WAS PAY? FOLLOWED BY CAREER AND MANY TIMES IT WAS CAREER GROWTH. FOLLOWED BY LEADERSHIP SET OF QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK WAS THE STRONGEST REASON THAT YOUR EMPLOYEES. CHOOSE TO STAY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. FOLLOWED BY ONE THING THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO LEAVE IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE SO STARTING ON THE STATE SIDE -- DUTIES DOING WORK THAT MATTERS WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON CITED FOLLOWED BY BENEFITS CO WORKERS. OTHERS THREE ELEMENTS ON THE STATE SIDE THAT ARE VERY STICKY PEOPLE TEND TO STAY FOR A LONG TIME WHEN THEY STAY FOR PEOPLE AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO THAT WOULD BE OUR CO WORKERS CAREER AND LEADERSHIP CATEGORIES. WHICH WILL FREE AGGREGATE THOSE TOGETHER LOOKING ABOUT 37% OF ALL STAY REASONS FALLING INTO THOSE CATEGORIES SO WE'D LIKE TO GET THAT HIGHER. STRONGER WE CAN GET THAT THE LONGER YOU'LL HAVE RETENTION -- ON THAT LEAVES SIDE PAY WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON WITH THIRTY SIX POINT 7% OF RESPONSES DEALING WITH PAY -- THE THEMES THERE WERE THE FEELING THAT PAY MAYBE A LITTLE STAGNANT -- AND THERE MAY BE SOME IN EQUITY IN TERMS OF ONE PERSON DOING -- OR TWO PEOPLE DOING THE SAME JOB AND ONE BEING PAID SOUP SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FOR IT. THE SECOND MOST COMMON WAS CAREER AND THAT WAS LACK OF GROWTH THEIR ADVANCEMENT. AND FINALLY LEADERSHIP AND THAT THAT WITH A HOSTILE ON FAIR WORK ENVIRONMENT. ONE THING TO NOTE IS WE HAD ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOME ODD MORE STAY REASONS THEN LEAVE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT NOW WOULD COST THEM TO LEAVE SO VERY HEALTHY TO SEE MORE STAY RECENT INSTANTLY. SO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF FIRST RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE REGARDING THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND PROPHECIES THAT YOU HAVE. AROUND HARASSMENT AND HOW TO CREATE A ACCEPTING UNFAIR OPEN ENVIRONMENT. ALSO WE RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE A REVIEW FIRST TO ASSESS THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE CURRENT CLIMATE NOT KNOWING WHEN THOSE WERE WRITTEN. MAKING SURE THEIR CURRENT. AND ARE THEY CLEARLY DEFINED. SECOND WOULD BE TO RESET IN TERMS OF EDUCATING EMPLOYEES. ON WHAT APPROPRIATE AVENUES THERE ARE TO LOG COMPLAINTS. AND TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS MADE. THIRD THEN WOULD BE TO EVALUATE HOW WELL THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE BEING USED. SO WHAT IS THE RATE OF USAGE. HARM UNDER THE UNEMPLOYED UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS -- HOW WELL ARE THEY BEING EXECUTED HARD TO FOLLOW UP STEPS THAT ARE DEFINED IN YOUR PROCESS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS MADE ARE THEY BEING FOLLOWED? SO INDIVIDUALS ARE AWARE OF WHERE THEIR COMPLAINT MAY BE IN THAT PROCESS. AND LASTLY ENFORCE THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH IS A BALANCE BETWEEN CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PROCESS WITH TRANSPARENCY IN WHERE WE ARE IN THE INVESTIGATION. AND FOLLOW UP WITH THAT PERSON WHO REPORTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD RECOMMENDATIONS ARE HERE I MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THE STRENGTH OF YOUR CO WORKERS 83% ENGAGED BY THEIR CO WORKERS -- SOLUTION OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THAT BY EDUCATING ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW TO CREATE THAT FAIR INCLUSIVE CLIMATE. MORE EMPLOYEES REPORTED THAT THEY WITNESSED HARASSMENT. THEN THEY REPORTED EXPERIENCING HARASSMENT. SO WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE BYSTANDERS WHO WITNESSED THAT TAKE ACTION. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR AFFILIATION FOR THEIR CO WORKERS THEY SHOULD BE SO MOTIVATED. AND SO WE WANT TO EDUCATE ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO ANONYMOUSLY REPORT INCIDENTS THAT THEY HAVE WITNESSED. AND THE COURAGE THE EMPLOYEES TO MAKE REPORTS. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT. STEPS INVOLVED IN THE PROPHECIES INCLUDING WHO WILL BE HANDLING COMPLAINTS. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THAT FEAR OF RETALIATION. WE BELIEVE LEADERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MODEL. HOW THEY SHOULD WORK? IN TERMS OF BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES AND CREATING A FAIR AND INCLUDE INCLUSIVE CLIMATE MAKE THAT A PRIORITY IN THE WAY THEY LEAD. AGAIN THE INCIDENTS OF OR THE PERCENTAGE OF SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL WHO REPORTED. WITNESSING OR EXPERIENCING WAS DOUBLE THE RATE. OF NON SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL SO WE WANT THEM TO STEP UP OF DAY I HAVE WITNESSED. OR EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SHOULD MODEL THE APPROPRIATE RATE TO REPORT THAT. AND LASTLY WE WILL REASSESS THESE METRICS WITH A FOLLOW UP SURVEY ONCE THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENACT CHANGES. AND WHAT THOSECHANGES FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM. SO THAT WAS THE PRESENTATION THAT I HAD PREPARED THIS MORNING. THANK QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE PANEL MUSTERED DAILY. THAT YOU DON'T SHARE -- SO THE ONE I THINK THE THE THE BIGGEST QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT. FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T PARTICIPATE. AND IN IT THERE WAS A REASON THEY DIDN'T PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THERE WAS FEAR. THEN IT WOULD SKEW THE WHOLE OUTCOME OF THIS -- SURVEY IF THEY DID IF THEY FELT SECURE AND THE AND THE OPTIONS WERE OR THE RESULTS WERE DIFFERENT. AND I KNOW THAT TIME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET. THEM TO BUY IT FOR EVERYBODY TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY GET A A A A PER FREAKS SURVEY. SO I'M JUST IN MY OWN. TIME OF LISTENING -- TO EMPLOYEES OF OF THE BODY. THAT THERE WERE MANY THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM. SO HOW DO YOU -- I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH. THE RESULTS IF FOLKS DIDN'T PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THERE WAS FEAR OF RETALIATION OR THERE WAS NO TRUST TO WHAT AND IN IN OTHER. S. CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE AND WHAT WHAT DO YOU HOW DO YOU DO WHAT DO YOU DO. TO GET PARTICIPATION IN IN A IN THE ARENA WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TRUST. SO PARTICIPATION RATES ARE ALWAYS A CHALLENGE THIS SUBJECT MATTER IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. GENERALLY EMPLOYEES WILL PARTICIPATE IF THEY SEE VALUE IN DOING SO. AND THEY GENERALLY JUDGE VALUE IN TWO WAYS. FIRST DID THEY HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE FOR OF THE SURVEY THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN THIS CASE WERE TRYING TO GET PARTICIPATION UP IN THE SECOND SURVEY. AND SECONDLY DID THEY SEE ANYTHING CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THAT. SO GOING FORWARD WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE 46% WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND THOSE TWO ELEMENTS COMMUNICATION OF THE RESULTS AND THEM SEEING CHANGES BEING MADE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. WOULD DRIVE PARTICIPATION HIGHER. AND THE SECOND ADMINISTRATION. I THINK IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT DATA IT'S WHAT WE HAVE IT'S WITHIN THE RANGE OF WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT WHICH IS 3250% -- I THINK ALSO SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL TALKING TO THEIR TEAMS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY. ENCOURAGING THEM TO PARTICIPATE ALL OF THAT HELPS [inaudible] JUST. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR -- SO WHAT IF YOU HAD 30% JUST I'M JUST PICKING A NUMBER. IF YOU HAD 30% OF THE FORTY NINE THAT DIDN'T PARTICIPATE. WHAT WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH? THERE WAS NO TRUST THAT WOULD TOTALLY CHANGE THIS. THE THE OUTCOME OF THIS SURVEY. IN. IN WHERE WE SHOULD HEAD MAYBE RIGHT. I THINK THE DATA IN BE FAIR INCLUSIVE DRIVER THAT WE THE LAST WE LOOKED AT WERE WORKED FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL IN TERMS OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE LOW. I WOULD NOT SUSPECT THAT IF THERE WERE ANOTHER 30% WHO PARTICIPATED WHO DIDN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM I DON'T THINK THE DATA WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. I THINK THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE RESPONDENT GROUP AS THE ONES. NEEDING ATTENTION ARE LIKELY TO NOT HAVE CHANGED [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MS WALDRON. EGGMAN -- TO JUST ON THAT THE SCREEN THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE UP ON NUMBER FIVE IT TALKS ABOUT EVALUATING GOING BACK AND REASSESSING AND WITH A FOLLOW UP SURVEY. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS THE TIMING? FOR THAT I MEAN HOW LONG ONCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED IN. YOU KNOW A YEAR SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE LONGER THAN THAT AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD START TO LOOK AT DOING A FOLLOW UP. WOULD SAY WAITING AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AFTER ALL OF YOUR CHANGES HAVE BEEN ENACTED. ANYWHERE FROM THAT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS TIME FRAME AFTER THEY'VE BEEN PLACED SO THAT THE EMPLOYEES GET A CHANCE TO SEE HOW THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PLAYING OUT. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND DOING THE EXACT SAME SURVEYS YOU CAN. COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES OR WOULD IT BE CHANGE SOMEONE WE KNEW TYPICALLY RECOMMEND THE EXACT SAME SURVEY WITH A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT ASK ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THEY HEARD ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST SURVEY HAD THEY SEEN THINGS CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THAT [inaudible] OKAY -- JUST A JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP. WHEN NEAR? OR ABOVE THAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT EDUCATING STE. CLOSE OF CLIMATE -- WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE WITNESSING THINGS THAT ARE BYSTANDERS -- HAVE YOU FOUND OR HOW HAS IT WORKED WITH YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY. PEOPLE USING APPS TO REPORT THOSE THINGS HAVE THEY BEEN SUCCESSFUL I MEAN I DON'T. THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS DAY AND AGE IS. YOU KNOW FAMILAR WITH ABSENT. HOW THEY WORK AS COMPARED? TO OTHER FORMS OF REPORTING. YEAH FORCE I DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APPS AS A WAY TO COLLECT A REPORT DATA I DON'T HAVE THAT FOR YOU TODAY [inaudible] THANK. IT'S A MEMBER IS. I I NEED IN REVIEWING THIS ALREADY I FEEL GOOD ABOUT SOME OF THIS. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYEES WITH THEIR CORN PLOY THESE I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT. I FEEL THAT -- THEY KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS AND WHERE WE LOSE THEM IS THE TRUST IN THE END THEY KNOW THE PROCESSES THEY KNOW HOW TO REPORT. THEY KNOW HOW HOW TO IDENTIFY HARASSMENT BUT THEY DON'T TRUST THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IN THE VERY BEGINNING YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS FAIR AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE. CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING? I THINK IT BEGINS WITH. THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE OUR THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE APPROPRIATE. FOR TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT. AND HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE EXECUTION OF THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH. IN THE INDUSTRY ABOUT TRAINING AND AND MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING TRAINING -- BUT IT'S MORE OF A CHECK THE BOX TRAINING DID EVERYONE GO THROUGH THE TRAINING. VERSES HOW EFFECTIVE WAS THE TRAINING. AT EDUCATING THE EMPLOYEES ON THE PROCESSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DOES THAT COHORT HAVE BEEN USING THAT PROCESS SO -- STEPS TO TAKE AROUND THAT WOULD BE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AS PART OF THE TRAINING EVALUATION. SO IT'S NOT JUST DID YOU ATTEND BUT ARE YOU NOW COMFORTABLE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE FOLLOWING THESE PROCESS THESE. I ALSO THINK GETTING SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL TO MODEL. IF THE INCIDENTS OF HARASSMENT FOR NOT SUPERVISOR PERSONNEL IS DOUBLE THAT OF NON SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL. WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL USING THAT PROCESS. AND SO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S DONE I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION MORE COMFORTABLE FOLLOWING THE PROPS. THANK YOU IT AT PAGE TEN ORGANIZATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S THOSE EMPLOYEES DO NOT FEEL SECURE IN THEIR JOBS. HE PICKED UP OUR I WOULD MY QUESTION IS IS THERE A QUESTION BETWEEN FEELING SECURE AND FEELING. SAFE. A FEELING SECURING YOUR JOB OUR OUR EMPLOYEES ARE AT WILL EMPLOYEES. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SECURE BECAUSE THEY ARE AT WILL EMPLOYEES. I THINK IT WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T COMFORTABLE QUESTIONING A POLICY OR PROCEDURE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING PENALIZED. THAT WAS THE NATURE OF THAT ELEMENT. AND THEN THE LAST AREA IS AT PAGE [inaudible] ELEVEN SEE. THE MOST PREVAILING INDICATION OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM LOBBYISTS. AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AS OPPOSED A CONFLUENCE OF SUPERVISORS WITH AND LEGISLATORS. BUT THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS DON'T ADDRESS. ANY SPECIFIC REPORTING. FOR THE ISSUES RELATED TO LOBBYISTS AND THE THIRD PARTY OR THIRD PARTIES OR POP UP PUBLIC. I THINK THAT WOULD GO BACK TO OUR FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN TERMS OF ARE THEY APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT CLIMATE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR CURRENT POLICIES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED LOBBYISTS OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. BUT IF THEY DON'T THAT WOULD BE S. A RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. CONSTITUENCY OR THE ACTS THAT COHORT IS A SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED. BY THE POLICIES AND THEY'RE VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THAT THEN WITH THE IF IF THERE IS A HARASSMENT. BY LOBBYIST ON ONE OF OUR STAFF. DOES NOT REPORT GO TO OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL DOESN'T GO THROUGH OUR PROCESS AND JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE JUST ARE THEY JUST OF THE CULTURE SURVEY THEY HAVE NOT REVIEWED OUR POLICIES THEY THEY'RE NOT GIVING IN THEIR NOT GIVING SUGGESTIONS AS TO OUR POLICY SO I THINK. I WOULD RECOMMEND HOLDING THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS UNTIL WE PRESENT THE POLICIES. ALRIGHT I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT. OF THE FINDINGS IT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HARASSMENT OF OUR STAFF IF WE'RE FINDING THAT THE THE GREATEST MAJORITY IS COMING FROM LOBBYIST IN FROM THE OUTSIDE. CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THANK YOU SO MUCH. I SEVEN TO TAKE JUST A CHAIR'S PREROGATIVE JUST JUMP IN AND ASK YOU A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. WHICH IS THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT HARASSMENT. NOT SPECIFIC TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CORRECT CORRECT SO JUST TO MAKE THE POINT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW THAT. YOU'RE ANSWERING THE PHONE YOU CAN FEEL PRETTY HARASSED BY THE PUBLIC SOMETIMES IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE. LEGISLATORS DOING THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT KEEP THAT IN MIND IT ALSO IN THE FUTURE IF WE DO THIS WHEN WE DO THIS AGAIN. WE PROBABLY SHOULD FIRST OUTING SEPARATE LOBBYIST FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR THAT VERY REASON IT'S A DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT ANIMAL IN THIS UNIVERSE. CONTINUE WITH THE PANEL SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE STAFF. WHO TOOK THE TIME TO RESPOND AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T -- I'M GONNA LOOK TO RULES STAFF FROM BOTH HOUSES IN THE FIRST ROW JUST TO VERIFY THAT WHAT I'M A MISSTATEMENT MONTH I'M ABOUT TO MAKE IS TRUE AND THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENGAGED TO CLIMATE SURVEY FOR STAFF. AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. I HAVE TO SAY I AS THEY'VE IN MY PRIOR LIFE AND THEN THE PLAY BEFORE COMING HERE I WAS SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER. OF EMPLOYEES AND LEGISLATE TOWER WOULD NEVER EXPERIENCE A CLIMATE SURVEY SO THIS IS VERY NEW. ARM AND ARE WE NOW WITH ALL THINGS NEW -- GENERALLY REGARDLESS OF THE CRIME OR CURRENTLY LIVING MAN THERE WILL BE SKEPTICISM. IF YOU COULD FLIP TO PAGE TWENTY TWO FORMALLY. I DISLIKE TWENTY TWO I APPRECIATE THAT -- MAYBE IT'S LIKE [inaudible] TWENTY THREE YES. BECAUSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S NEW WE HAVE A UP BY AN EMPLOYEE POOL THAT NEVER. PARTICIPATED IN A CLIMATE SO BE BEFORE WE PAINSTAKINGLY SENSE CRAFTED THE LETTERS THAT WERE SIGNED BY LETTER SHIP LEADERSHIP AND PAINSTAKINGLY. LOOK AT THE WORDING OF EVERY QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO GET TO A ROUTE ANSWERED THAT. ALL WAS USEFUL IN THIS PROCESS. AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE E. IN PS COLUMN. WHEN I LOOK AT THE DETRACTOR PASSIVE PROMOTER NUMBERS? THAT TO ME LOOKS LIKE AN ORGANIZATIONAL BELL CURVE. WHICH CAN BE -- TRANSPOSED TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE CERTAINLY ARE ELECTED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT MAY NOT. THAT CAN BE TRANSPOSON MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE CONSIDERED HEALTHY. YOU GOT DISSED DETRACTORS. THE VAST MAJORITY ON THE PASSIVE I COME TO WORK EVERYDAY AND DO MY JOB WHATEVER. AND THEN THE PROMOTERS WHO ARE TRUE CHAMPIONS IN CHEERLEADERS SO THAT'S HOW I PRINT READ THE THREE FIFTY SIX FIVE FORTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THAT IT SORT OF EAT AND THAT'S A BELL CURVE. LOW HIGH THEN GOES BACK LOW. SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THE RAIN SHOULD BE ONE TO THIRTY AND WE SEE A NEGATIVE NUMBER UP THERE. THAT DOESN'T COMPETE WITH MY INTERPRETATION OF THE BELL CURVE'S NUMBERS SO HELP ME. I AGREE WITH YOU IT DOES LOOK LIKE A BELL CURVE IN TERMS OF THOSE DATA. BEING IT E. NPS CALCULATION IS A DIFFICULT ONE TO STRINGENT ONE SO THAT MATH IS WE TAKE THE NUMBER OF PROMOTERS. WE SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF DETRACTORS AND WE DIVIDE BY ALL. SO IT'S A MEASURE THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND IT'S ONE THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS IF WE CAN GET POSITIVE. IT BEGETS MORE POSITIVITY WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE. BEING CHAMPIONS CHEERLEADERS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND IT BECOMES IN FACT. SO THAT IT IS YOUR RIGHT IT'S A BELL CURVE DATA. BUT WE WOULD. AND THIS METRIC LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THOSE PROMOTERS [inaudible] GOT [inaudible] OKAY. THAT HELPS ME. HE TURNED BACK TO SLIDE THIRTEEN FORMING IT'S ANOTHER METHODOLOGY QUESTION THAT I'M JUST NOT TRACKING. SO HELP ME AGAIN WHAT THE HELL E. AYE AND THREE POINT SIX FIVE ON THE BOTTOM YEAH THAT'S DIVIDED BY. CARRIED THE ONE HELP EARLY. SO WE WE LOOKED AT EACH RESPONDENTS. RATINGS OF THESE ITEMS AND THEY RATED THEM ON A FIVE POINT SCALE OF AGREEMENT FIVE AS I STRONGLY AGREE. IF THE RATING ACROSS ALL FIVE OF THOSE ITEMS WAS THREE POINT SIX FIVE OR HIGHER THAT INDIVIDUALS DEEMED TO BE ENGAGED BY THAT PARTICULAR DRIVER GOD THEY WOULD BE IN THE PROMOTER CATEGORY IN IN THAT VERNACULAR YES GOT IT. AND SO IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET SOMEONE TO KEEP THAT AVERAGE RATING OF THREE DOT SIX FIVE THAN JUST LOOKING AT PAUL RADER'S WHO AGREE. WITH THOSE STATEMENTS QUE. SO THEN THIS SAYS IN THE FIRST FLY THE LEGISLATURE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATES THE DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC IS A HIGH PRIORITY. 69% ARE THEY OUT THE THREE POINT SIX FIVE PLUS SOME IT WAS 69% RATED THAT A FOUR OR FIVE I GOT ANGRY OR I STRONGLY AGREE WITH THAT GUY GOD. AND MY LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY IF THEY GOT A SLY. TWENTY SIX ALL I APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF AND I'M CLEAR IN TERMS OF YOUR LANE BUT WHAT ROLE. YOU PLAY IN THIS PROCESS AND WHAT ROLE WE THAT PLAY IN TAKING THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GLEANED FROM LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND DOING SOMETHING WITH IT. WHICH IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DO -- AND SO I YOUR QUESTION THREE ARE YOU STATEMENT REFERRING TO TRANSPARENCY BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE STEPS INVOLVED IN THE PROPHECIES INCLUDING WHO WILL BE HANDLING COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE FEAR OF RETALIATION. AND I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT. ONLY CLARITY ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS ALONE CAN ACTUALLY MITIGATE FEAR MY SENSE IS. WHAT DRIVES THE FEE AROUND RETALIATION? IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ME JUST UNDERSTAND IN THE PROCESS AND WHO WILL DO WHAT NEXT. SO COULD YOU EXPAND ON YOUR STATEMENT A LITTLE MORE. YET IN THE DATA WE SAW THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO THERE WAS A THERE WAS A RISK OF RETALIATION IF I WAS A REPORTER. OR IF I EXPERIENCED. SO. HAVING TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROCESS WHAT CAN I EXPECT. HAS A REPORTER OF EITHER WITNESSING OR EXPERIENCING HARASSMENT. TO HEAR BACK FROM WHOM BY WHEN. WAS THE NET NATURE OF THE OF THE DATA THAT WE SAW AROUND THIS I SO THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION CAN THEN KIND OF FUEL THAT SEE I KNEW I SHOULD THE TOLD THAT. AS OF THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION I GUESS LIKE I GET YOU THEN FUELS THE FEAR BASED ON THAT THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE CONVERSATION ITH YOURSELF YEAH OKAY AND SO THAT'S WHY I DID IT IS PROMOTION BECAUSE THAT GOES BACK TO THAT. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT THE NEXT STEPS WHERE I FOLLOW YOU. ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE OUT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUR FIRM. I'M I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- STEP THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOOK IN TERMS OF ENGAGING ALL EMPLOYEES. AND ENGAGE THEMSELVES TALK WHY AM I HERE WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR ME TO STAY HERE. I DON'T GET IT IN EMPOWERS US WITH -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE. TO OUR EMPLOYEE PULL -- TO BOTH MANAGE AND HELP ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS -- ALL OF US WANT TO WORK SOMEPLACE WITH A PAY S. ARE. PERCEPTION OF OUR OWN VALUE. EXCEPT EXCEPT ERA -- AND SO TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR WORKFORCE REALISTICALLY ABOUT AREAS WHERE THEY ARE FINITE RESOURCES BUT AREAS WHERE WE CAN STRETCH IT'S AN ORGANIZATION THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING. I AM SO PROUD TO SEE THE RESPONSES AROUND COWORKER MUTUAL RESPECT ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH YOUR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR -- THAT IS. A VERY TELLING. AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE GIVEN THE FACT QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE'VE PROVIDED. LIMITED SUPPORT TO OUR SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND WHATEVER THAT THEY HAVE DONE. AMAZING WORK WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY WERE GIVEN AND SO I HOPE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE GAS. TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SUPPORTS TO CONTINUE -- TO DO BETTER I LIKE THE RESET RECOMMENDATION AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT. TO GIVE -- INCLUDED THAT FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE TREATED TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES BUT HOW WE KIND OF STRATEGICALLY APPROACH HOW WE ON BOARD EMPLOYEES. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A REAL -- FOCUSED AREA FRANKLY OF OUR WORK BUT HOW WE ONBOARD NEW STAFF. ON IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK -- IT'S WHAT WE DO WITH THAT AND AND I KNOW -- THROUGH THIS BY CAMEL PROCESS -- WE'RE NOT GONNA LET IT GO AND WILL CONTINUE TO UNDO ALL WE CAN TO IMPROVE THOSE LOWER PERFORMING NUMBERS AND GETTING IN TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. ON THOSE HIGH PERFORMING AREAS FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THAT. THANK YOU AYE MR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK YOU'RE VERY TOUCHED ON THIS PRETTY WELL. BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR ON PAGE. ELEVEN YOU DO USE THE TITLE LOBBYIST SLASH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SINCE YOU PUT LOBBYIST FIRST YOU KNOW WE JUST. NATURAL REACT THAT IT MUST BE THE LOBBYIST -- SO I'M JUST CURIOUS DID YOU DIFFERENTIATOR SEGREGATE. OR WAS I JUST ONE CATEGORY AND IT WAS ONE CATEGORY JUST WRITTEN THE WAY YOU SAW. SO COULD BE 1% LOBBYIST 99% MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WEEK. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SO WE CAN'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE THE FIRST THING WAS ALL MY GOODNESS WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SO WE CAN MAKE THAT CONCLUSION. WE DO KNOW THAT OUR STAFF GET PLENTY OF FUN PHONE CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS AND SINCE IT'S OUTSIDE THE WORKFORCE -- DO YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION OFTEN. IN OTHER SURVEYS. IF THERE'S AN INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC THAT SUBSTANTIAL AS PART OF A ROLL YES [inaudible] SO THEN -- THAT JUST. WHAT JUST DAB? PART OF THE JOB IS GONNA. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU GET BATTLE PAY OR WHATEVER. WE CALL IT JUST. SO WHAT WHY WOULD IT BE ASKED. USUALLY TO SEE HOW THE ORGANIZATION IS SET UP TO HANDLE ISSUES THAT COME FROM THAT INTERACTION ARE THERE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM. INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IF THAT'S PART OF THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND IS IT USUALLY HIGHER THAN OTHER CATEGORIES IN OTHER SURVEYS. TYPICALLY NOT AT THIS LEVEL NOT NOT THIS HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DEVELOP A POLICY. TO ADDRESS THAT. I THINK IT'S PART OF THAT OVERALL POLICY THAT YOU KOW YOU'RE. REFLECTING THAT'S AN ELEMENT OF THEIR ROLES AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM FROM THAT ELEMENT HERE'S WHAT YOU DO ABOUT IT AS AN EMPLOYEE. TO APPROPRIATE REPORT APPROPRIATELY REPORT THAT VERY MUCH. IF YOU HAVE CHAIR. THANK YOU SUMMER DALY. TO FOLLOW PRO QUIT ON SO WHAT WERE YOU EARN IT DID YOU HELP PUT THE SURVEY TOGETHER YES AND SO IN YOUR EXPERIENCES WOULD IS WAS IT. A SO WE GO FORWARD IS THERE IS THERE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE THAT MAYBE WE CAN GET MORE PARTICIPATION. SO PARTICIPATION IS DRIVEN BY COMMUNICATION. AGAIN TWO ELEMENTS I TALKED ABOUT ALREADY. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE DATA SO WELL ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD TO PUT INTO THE FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS IS? FIRST AND FOREMOST COMMUNICATE BACK TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS OF THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING. WE GOT THE DATA AND WE'LL BE WORKING ON IT JUST THAT SIMPLE MESSAGE REINFORCES FOR THEM THAT YOU TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY AND SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. AND THEN PRIOR TO THE NEXT SURVEY AS MUCH COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE IN EVERY FORUM THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE SO CERTAINLY THE LETTERS FROM LEADERSHIP HELP BUT LITERALLY MY DIRECT SUPERVISOR SAYING TO ME PLEASE TAKE A SURVEY. I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VERY IMPACTFUL THANK YOU. Q. SENATOR BATES. I'M LOOKING AT SLIDES AYE NUMBER. US SIX REGARDING THE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPANTS AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE VOLUNTEERS SIGN BEING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT. COME THROUGH HERE MY ONLY WHERE TWO OR THREE MONTHS OF WINTERS HOW DID YOU ARE FACTORED THAT IN INSURANCE AWAY YOU WAITED THE RESPONSES I KNOW YOU HAVE ONE TO THREE YEARS. ARE IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. BUT MANY OF OUR PEOPLE IN THERE THAT WAS HEAVILY SKEWED WITH VOLUNTEER RESPONSES COULD YOU PICK THEM ALL UP BY THAT -- THEIR EMAIL THAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED. THE TREND I SEE THIS IS A TREND HERE IN TERMS THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT. YOU KNOW OUR INSTITUTIONS SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN. THE VOLUNTEERS SPONSON IN WHETHER. YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE SURVEY WE DID REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE INPUT ON TYPICALLY SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY. TO TO MEASURE THAT WHEN WE WERE REVIEWING THIS BEFORE TODAY'S MEETING. SO IN THE FINDINGS THAT WE PRESENTED WE DIDN'T WAIT AND THE GROUP OVER ANOTHER SO WAS SUCH TOTAL. AVERAGE OF ALL RESPONDENTS. SO THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE WORKED OR BEEN PRESENT. IN ON THE LEGISLATURE FOR A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE YOU ACCEPTED THAT. IN THE DATA. WE WE SENT ONE TO THREE YEARS THIS YEAR LOSS COUNT. YET WE RECEIVED A FILE FROM THE LEGISLATURE WITH EMPLOYEES AND WHEN WE DID NOT PARKS THAT FILE. WE'VE WE TOOK THE FILE THAT WAS PROVIDED AN I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT CRITERIA AS TO WHO WAS INCLUDED. OTHER THAN THE FILE THAT WE RECEIVED I ONLY MENTION IT BECAUSE I THINK THE ME TOO MOVEMENT BEING SO. SO. YOU KNOW PREVALENT DURING THE CLIMATE SURVEY. AND THE FOLKS THAT WERE RESPONDING OFF HAD ON FEWER YEARS HERE THAT RESPONDED OF YOU KNOW AND MORE NUMBERS STAND THOSE WHO'VE BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF YEARS -- MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT TOO BECAUSE THERE COULD BE IMPRESSIONS OUR PERCEPTIONS. ALL THAT ARE NECESSARILY -- THAT ACCURATE NOT I THINK IT'S A GREAT SERVICE THINK IT SHOWS DEFINITELY TRANSCEND IT HELPS THOSE I THINK AS WE LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT. BUT I JUST WANT TO GET NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT 50% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE DID RESPOND. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AN INDICATION THAT NEITHER WE ARE COMMUNICATING WELL OF THE DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING ON AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. TO THE POLICIES ARE DEVELOPING. THE OTHER RESPONSE RATE AGAIN IT WOULD EXPECT WITH A SURVEY OF THIS NATURE. SO IT'S ABOUT RANGERS 3250% SO WE'RE ACTUALLY THE TOP END OF THAT RANGE TO THINK IS A VERY HEALTHY SIGN. AND IF I MIGHT JUST TO GET CLARITY SENATOR ARE YOU -- ARE YOU. SAYING THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAD MORE OF THE SHORTER TERM EMPLOYEES RESPONDING THE LONGER TERM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE PART JUST I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGES IN TERMS OF THE CATEGORIES OF THE LENGTH OF TIME YOU WORKED HERE. WELL THIS IS INFORMATION THAT MY STAFF PUT TOGETHER. AND SO HE'S ON THAT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM RHETORIC ON BECAUSE WE DO WE KNOW THAT. THREE YEARS IS THE LENGTH OF TIME PEOPLE THERE. YOU KNOW THINKING THEY'RE GONNA STAY WHICH IS A GOOD IN INDICATOR. THAT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE TOO MANY THEY MIGHT LIKE IT BETTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE SAYING HEY I'M OUT HERE ITSELF SURE I'M JUST SAYING IN IT YET HELPS US AS WE DEVELOP. THE COMMUNICATION TRANSPARENCY IN PROTECTION ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO BRING FORWARD. IN OUR POLICIES [inaudible] OKAY -- OTHER TO MS REYES UNLESS YOU MISS MITCHELL HAD SOMETHING FOR SPECIFICALLY ON THIS. OKAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU I WANT TO GO BACK TO SLIDE. ELEVEN THE MOST BUT SEE THE MOST VIOLENT INDICATION OF HARASSMENT RESULTED FROM LOBBYIST MEMBERS OF PUBLIC. DO WE KNOW IF THIS WAS HARASSMENT. IN THE CAPITAL OUTSIDE DURING FUNDRAISERS DURING OTHER EVENTS. WE DON'T KNOW THAT WAS SPECIFICS WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF EMPLOYEES AT THE CAPITOL. OF WITNESSED FOR EXPERIENCED HARASSMENT THAN IN THE DISTRICTS. FROM LOBBYISTS OUTSIDE OKAY YES. AND THE OTHER AT ALL YOUR SLIDE. TWENTY SIX ON EDUCATING ALL STAKEHOLDERS. MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT. IT WAS THE BYSTANDER TRAINING. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OF MAKING SURE THAT. DIDN'T THE BYSTANDERS WHO SEE WHO WITNESSED THIS ARE -- ARE TRAINED SO THAT THEY WILL REPORT IT YES OKAY. THANK YOU THANK ON MEDICARE SENATOR MITCHELL. YEAH THANK YOU ARM. I JUST WANTED. TO I GUESS JUST SAY FOR MYSELF I'M SORRY MISTER DALI LEFT THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS ONE DATA POINT THEN I DON'T. I DON'T CHOOSE -- TO NAY GATE THE DATA PROVIDED TO US BY THE PERCENTAGE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO DID BASED ON AN OVERWHELMING CONCERN OVER PEOPLE WHO CHOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. I THINK WE INDIVIDUALLY AS MEMBERS TO HAVE HAD IT WILL CONTINUE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK TO OUR STAFF AND OUR OWN STAFF MEETING. ABOUT OUR PERCEPTION OF THE VALUE OF THEIR INPUT -- AND SO I DON'T WANT US TO GET STUCK IN CONTINUE TO QUESTION WILL THE FIVE MORE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATED WITH ITS SKILLET. IT'S JUST ONE DATA POINT THAT WHAT WHAT WE LEARN HERE. WILL NOT OVERWHELMINGLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE AS AN EMPLOYEE HERE IT'S A DATA POINT IT'S A POINT IN TIME MEASUREMENT. OF MY EXPERIENCE EITHER AS A TWENTY YEAR EMPLOYEE A THREE YEAR EMPLOYEE -- IT'S GOOD DATA THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HEAR OR SEE. IT IS A BENCHMARK FROM WHICH WE HOPE TO HAVE BONTA GOING EXPERIENCES RECEIVING DATA -- IT IS MY ASSUMPTION PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M OFF MARK THAT AS WE MAKE CLIMATE SURVEYS A PART OF OUR CULTURE AND PEOPLE COME TO EXPECT AND UNDERSTAND THE TOOL. THAT YOUR UP TO CAN PARTICIPATION INCREASES OVER TIME IT DOES IF IF THEY SEE THOSE RESULTS. TALKED ABOUT CAN THEY SEE ACTION TAKEN IF WE PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH SO AGAIN IF CALL COMES BACK ON ON US -- THE THIS MAY BE AN UNFAIR EXPECTED PERCENTAGE OF UPTICK AS YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE. SIR BASS I DON'T WORKPLACE YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S A FLAT OUTCOME IS THAT WE CAN EXPECT EXCELLENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THAT IS NO MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK TALENT KEEPERS I WANT TO THANK ESPECIALLY SENATOR MITCHELL WHO HAD SUGGESTED DOING THE CLIMATE SURVEY -- IT'S VERY HELPFUL AT ALL ALDOUS TELL YOU TWO DATA POINTS THAT I HEARD TODAY THAT I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF IS WE CREATE THE NEW HARASSMENT THAT WE'RE HEARING REPORTED FROM LOBBYISTS MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WAY. FOR THOSE INCIDENTS TO BE REPORTED AND TO BE ACTED ON IN SOME WAY COURSES LIMITATIONS AS TO WHAT WE CAN DO BUT WE CAN ALSO DO THINGS. IN TERMS OF KEEPING HARASSING. THEM A LOBBYIST OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- AWAY FROM OUR STAFF IF THEY REALLY HAVE ARE CROSSING THE LINE AND ALSO GIVING STAFF THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IF THEY'RE FEELING HARASSED. BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT OUR STAFF OUTFIELDER ANSWERING PHONES AND FEELING EVERY DAY LIKE THEY DON'T COME TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF ABUSE THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING -- AND THE SECOND IS BUILDING ON THE VERY STRONG RESULT WE SAW ABOUT THE TRUST OF AND APPRECIATION OF CO WORKERS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT TRAINING WE TALKED ABOUT BYSTANDER TRAINING AND AND CERTAINLY THIS MAKES THAT. ALL THE MORE -- POSITIVE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REALLY BUILD ON AS A STRENGTH. TO HARNESS THAT -- TO THAT KIND OF CULTURE CHANGE WE WANT. AND WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC THANK YOU. AND WE DO HAVE A VERY VERY SHORT. POWER POINT BUT MOSTLY WE'RE GOING TO BE JUSTICE SCOTT SAYING. THE POLICIES SO THIS THIS IS NOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SENATOR MITCHELL REPRESENTING THE SIDE INTO MYSELF -- A TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CHANGES FOR OUR POLICY. MY GOODNESS NOW I HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THIS THING THAT I WAS JUST HANDED. YEAH. OH ABSOLUTELY I'M SORRY YES OKAY SENATOR. THANK YOU I JUST SOME. ONE TO SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN IMPORTANT WORK AND I WANT TO THANK OF THE ARE CHAIR ONE MEANT FOR THE OUR SHE'S DEVOTED TO THAT ALL OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR INTEREST -- I SAW COMMERCIAL A LAST NIGHT -- ON TV I THINK IT WAS OUT THE AD AND THE TAGLINE WAS PROGRESS IS NEVER STANDING STILL. ON THAT I THINK OUR ON GOING WORK IN THIS AREA ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE. ON OUR ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE COMMUNITY ON THIS REFLECTIVE IN THAT. THIS IS NOT AT LEGISLATIVE OR OVERSIGHT PROCESS A WE ENGAGED MONTHS AGO NOW AND SAY THE POLICY FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE LEGISLATURE'S NEXT STEPS IN REFRAMING OUR INSTITUTIONAL. CULTURE BASED ON VALUES. AND WE HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY DELIBERATE TO HAVE -- BECAUSE WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT MICROMANAGE -- OUR GOAL IN OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATORS IS TO ESTABLISH POLICY AND OUR INTENT. GIVEN THAT IMPORTANT ROLE WE PLAY AS BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAS GUIDED OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE INTENTIONALLY DELIBERATIVE. WE APPROACH THIS FROM A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS FRAMEWORK. IN THE MIDST OF CLAIMS FIELD BY PUBLIC INTERESTS. SCRUTINY AND FEAR. FEAR FROM FELL LEGISLATORS HERE FROM STAFF -- FEAR FROM EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. SO THAT WAS REALLY THE FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH I APPROACH THIS WORK AND WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY -- INTO BY CAMEL WAY THAT TOO CAN BE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE PRACTICED REGULARLY IN THIS PLACE WE AB ASSEMBLY OF THE SENATE WE DO OUR SEPARATE BUSINESS. AND SO TO TO PRACTICE A BICAMERAL STRATEGY IN DEVELOPING THIS APPROACH WAS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON IN TERMS OF SHOWING THE EXAMPLE TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY ABOUT HEY. HEY HOW IMPORTANT ISSUE WAS. AND BE HOW CRITICAL IT WAS WE CAME TOGETHER AS ENTIRE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS IT -- AND SO I'M PROUD OF THE WORK -- THAT WE'VE PUT INTO IT BOTH THE PROCESS AND THE OUTCOME. WE ARE FAR FROM FINISHED OUR AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY EVOLVE FOR IT IT -- MYSTERY BUT AND I TO LEAD YOU IN THIS EFFORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH POT I WANT TO THANK THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK. AS YOU CAN SEE. ALL I PUSHED A BUTTON AND NOTHING HAPPENED YEAH SO I WAS JUST. OKAY THANK YOU WE HAD FIVE HEARINGS. BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH THAT DEALT IN TO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS THAT SHAPE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT HEARING I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR WORK. NOW AS I GO THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS UNTIL THE END EXCEPT FOR SENATOR MITCHELL BECAUSE WE DID DEVELOP THIS TOGETHER AS PARTNERS. AND I WANT HER TO JUMP IN TALK WITH ME TALK OVER ME -- WE'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING THIS TOGETHER AS WE GO THROUGH IT'S GOING TO BE MOSTLY A VERBAL PRESENTATION -- A THIS IS A OUR FIRST ADDITIONS TO GIVE YOU THE BROAD POLICY DIRECTION WE'RE GOING TO BE FILLING IN A LOT OF BLANKS OVERTIME WE ALSO WANT TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS -- SO THAT NET BETWEEN NOW AND THURSDAY WE CAN CUT YOU KNOW EVALUATE THEM AND COME BACK WITH PERHAPS -- MODIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT WILL GO TO JOINT RULES FOR ADOPTION. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH STAFF TO FLESH OUT ALL OF THE DETAILS AYE BUT THESE ARE THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK NOT A COMPLETE SET OF POLICIES OKAY SO. THE ENTIRE PROPOSALS CENTERS ON CULTURE CHANGE WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT WRITTEN POLICY BUT IF YOU DON'T EMBODIED IN YOUR ORGANIZATION. IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK ND SO CHANGING THE CULTURE IS IS IS OUR GOAL AND BECAUSE AND BASED ON THAT EVERY ASPECT OF POLICY THAT WE HAVE THAT GOES INTO. SEXUAL AND OTHER TYPES OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION WILL CHANGE AND EVERY CHANGE IS DONE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS [inaudible] CULTURE CHANGE. AND OF AND THAT IS OF A CULTURE OF RESPECTABILITY IN DIVERSITY AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS THIS ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. WE SEE THIS TO THIS DISCUSSION GOING ON ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMING FORWARD AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD AND RISK WHATEVER RETALIATION THEY MIGHT. HAVE AND WE HAVE TO THANK THEM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WITH THIS THAT'S NOT UNIQUE TO OUR CULTURE. BUT WHAT IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE TO OUR CULTURE AND TO MANY OTHER CULTURES WILL WE SEE A LOT OF US OF HARASSMENT. IS A VERY LARGE IMBALANCE BETWEEN POWER. OF SOME MEMBERS OF OUR WORK FORCE AND OTHERS OF COURSE WITH MEMBERS AND SENIOR STAFF AT THE TOP OF THAT HIERARCHY. INTERNS AND YEAH I'M -- ENTRY LEVEL STUFF POSSIBLY BEING SEEN AS BEING ON THE BOTTOM. AND THAT AS WE HEARD FROM MANY EXPERTS IS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW TEND TO RUN INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE SO HOW DO WE REALIZING THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE NECESSARILY DEVELOP THAT CULTURE OF RESPECTABILITY IN DIVERSITY. SO THAT EVERYBODY IS VALUED EVERYBODY TOLERATE HARASSMENT TOWARDS ANYBODY AND WE HAVE A WAY OF HAVING A AN ABILITY. SO EXPANDING REPORTING AN INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT ADDRESSING PROBLEMS EARLY IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION. I'M ALSO GOING TO BE SUED RECOMMENDING THAT WE CREATE FOR THE FIRST TIME AN INDEPENDENT BICAMERAL UNIT. WITH AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF EXPERTS TO MAKE FACTUAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO MOVING ON A DRILLING DOWN MORE SPECIFICALLY INTO EACH OF THOSE AREAS. I'M THE FIRST AREA IS TO TRANSFORM THE LEGISLATORS WORKPLACE CULTURE TO PROMOTE RESPECT CIVILITY IN DIVERSITY. AND EVERY PERSON'S RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD ON THAT CULTURE. WE'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTING A MORE FORMAL. POLICY ON A WORKPLACE -- ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT -- WHICH WILL. TALK ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS SO IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE CAN'T BE OTHER KINDS OF HARASSMENT THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL HR PROCESS AS IT DOES NOW. THIS PANEL WILL DEAL WITH INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS. BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS AGE [inaudible] RACE GENDER. I AM DISABILITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT POLICY -- BASED ON THIS POLICY APPLIES TO MEMBERS EMPLOYEES INTERNS BALL CAGE A* VOLUNTEERS IN APPLICANTS AND POSSIBLY ALSO TWO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN AND TO LOBBYISTS. AS WE HEARD FROM OUR SURVEY. I'M THE FIRST STEP IS TO CREATE AN ENGAGING TRAINING PROGRAM WE HEARD OVER AND OVER THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD A TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CERTAINLY COMPLY COMPLIES WITH WHAT'S DONE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IS VERY TYPICAL IN SOME WAYS GOES BEYOND. WHAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS DO? WE WANT A TRAINING POLICY THAT IS MUCH MORE ENGAGING. MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE -- POSSIBLY INVOLVING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ALL OF THAT WILL BE EXPLORED BUT THE DIRECTION TO STOCK WILL BE. TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S A LOT MORE GEARED TOWARDS OUR UNIQUE FOR PLACE THE TYPES OF INTERACTIONS THAT WE HAVE THE INCLUDING SOCIAL EVENTS. DISTRICT -- AND A WAY THAT THE DISTRICT WORK SIX SUCH A SODA EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN THE BUILDING BUT ALSO OUT IN THE FIELD. I ALSO JUST ADD AGAIN THAT WE CAN BUILD ON WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT THE TRUST AND CO WORKERS WITH BYSTANDER TRAINING AND OTHER SORTS OF TRAINING WORK EMPLOYEES. RELY ON EACH OTHER. I'M WE WILL ALSO FIND WAYS TO PROMOTE RESPECT AND CIVILITY IN THE LEGISLATIVE WORKPLACE -- SO THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOOD BEHAVIOR AND FIND WAYS TO REWARD IT. WE WILL PROTECT EMPLOYEES WHO REPORT INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE STRONG ANTI RETALIATION PROCEDURES AND THAT IF? PEOPLE DO FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN RETALIATED AGAINST MAKING GO TO THE PANEL WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CASE YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND REPORT THAT RETALIATION AND AND HAVE A PATH TO JUSTICE SO THAT WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. IN EVERY WAY RETALIATION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. THEN IT MOVING ONTO ADDRESSING PROBLEMS EARLY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS KEY IN THIS IS A BIG CHANGE FROM WHAT HAPPENS NOW. WE WOULD LIKE [inaudible] TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD LIKE INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT REPORTED. EVEN IF IT'S A FIRST TIME OFFENSE EVEN IF IT'S ONE COMMENT. ONE IMAGE ONE JOKE AND THE REASON IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE TO EMPLOYEES OR PUNISH EMPLOYEES IS TO INTERVENE EARLY TO OFFER COUNSELING AND OFFER TRAINING BECAUSE ONE COMMENT MIGHT NOT. MEAN VERY MUCH OR SEEN SIGNIFICANT. BUT IF IF THAT BEHAVIOR CONTINUES AND NOW YOU HAVE TEN TWENTY THIRTY OF THOSE SAME KINDS OF INCIDENCES NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE ARE PERHAPS I'LL A WORKPLACE THAT DOES HAVE HARASSMENT. BUT NOW THAT EMPLOYEE HAS POSSIBLY CROSSED A LINE TO THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORDS IF WE'D INTERVENE EARLY WE COULD HAVE CORRECTED THAT PATH. AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON I'M UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR BEHAVIOR. I IN A WAY THAT. IS PROTECTIVE OF THAT PERSON AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH SO WE CAN. INTERVENE EARLY COUNSEL EARLY WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE'S JOBS AND HAVE A BETTER WORK ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE EXPECT IN TERMS OF CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHERS. SO WITH THAT GOAL WE WILL CREATE A WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT THAT'S THE UNIT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S A BICAMERAL UNIT WERE REPORTS OF THAT NATURE CAN. GO I WILL ALSO HAVE TO TRAIN OUR EMPLOYEES THAT WE EXPECT AND WE WANT THEM TO REPORT. THOSE INFRACTIONS THOSE VIOLATIONS OF WORKPLACE CONDUCT SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE HELD AGAINST YOU WE WANT TO INCREASE THE REPORTING OF THOSE VIOLATIONS THAT WE CAN'T INTERVENE EARLY AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TRAINING OF OUR WORKPLACE. SORRY WE TRYING. TO GET THAT WORD IN EDGEWISE. OKAY I'M SORRY -- THIS YEAR YES THAT'S THAT SECOND PART SUPERVISORS AND OTHERS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT THAT WILL BE WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO. AND I BELIEVE THAT ONCE THAT UNDERSTANDING IS OUT THERE THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE RETALIATION AND FACT WE WANT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE ENCOURAGING THAT REPORTING. WE ARE GOING TO OFFER COMPLETENESS ALTERNATIVES FOR ADDRESSING PROBLEMS SO WE'RE GOING TO HOPE TO INCORPORATE. THE SORT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TECHNIQUES AND OTHER PATHS THAT WE SEE AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE WILLING -- AT MEDIATION EARLY NOW NOT MEDIATION WITH THE PERSON WHO HAD THE VIOLATION BUT POSSIBLY MEDIATION WITH UMMAH THE SUPERVISORS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WORKPLACE THAT WE THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF EVERYBODY. SO WHEN COMPLAINTS COME IN JUST TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS WILL WORK EVERY COMPLAINT WILL BE TRIAGE IMMEDIATELY SO THAT IF WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN IF WE NEED NEED TO INTERVENE RIGHT AWAY TO PREVENT A SITUATION FROM ESCALATING THAT WILL HAPPEN. IF IT'S JUST COUNSELING OR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE QUICKLY ADJUDICATED THAT WILL HAPPEN -- SO THE MORE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF COURSE WILL SORT OF MOVE UP ON THAT SCALE AND OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW MAYBE CAN WAIT A LITTLE WHILE SO BUT THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE. EVALUATION OF EVERY COMPLAINT THAT'S THAT IS RECEIVED I'M. AT IF APPROPRIATE WILL ENGAGE THE ENTIRE OFFICE TEAM TO USE THAT AS A LEARNING PROCESS NOW MOVING ON TO INVESTIGATE REPORTS PROMPTLY. WE WILL BE CREATING A PANEL OF FIVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT. AN AVERAGESORT OF CITIZENS PANEL THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIRTY TWENTY FORTY YEARS OF EXPERTISE AS EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEYS. OF AS JUDGES WHO HAVE HANDLED THESE KINDS OF CASES WHO PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND THE LAW BUT WILL COME TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLICIES SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT EVERY CASE IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED WAY. TO EXPLORE THE NUANCES OF EVERY CASE SO THAT THEY SO THAT RESPONSES WILL BE TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUALS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS CULTURE CHANGE AND TRAINING AND CORRECTIVE PATHS. I WANT APPROPRIATE OF COURSE OF DISCIPLINE THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO THAT TO THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT WEATHER REPORT COMES IN IT WILL BE CLASSIFIED FOR FURTHER ACTION AND THAT IF WE NEED TO THERE WILL BE MORE THEY'LL BE EVIDENCE GATHERING WE WILL HAVE IN HOUSE INVESTIGATORS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WORKFORCE THAT TRUST US TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. NOW IF THERE ARE MEMBERS INVOLVED OR STAFF THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THOSE INVESTIGATORS THAT'S WE WILL CONSIDER SENDING OUT TO OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION. OF FAIRNESS -- AS THOSE REPORTS ARE DONE. OR AS YOU KNOW OF BIAS AND ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WILL REVIEW [inaudible] THE EVIDENCE THEY WILL DISCUSS THE INCIDENT AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY WILL THEN CONVENE THEIR PANEL AND SPEAK TO THE SUPERVISOR COMPANY WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE TO SAY TO THEM. THIS IS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED IS THIS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WILL DISCUSS THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY THAT THAT THE PANEL TRULY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE INCIDENT WAS. WHAT THE BACKGROUND IS WHAT LED UP TO IT ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTORS AND THEN BASED ON THAT THEY WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION? TO THE SUPERVISORS -- I HAVEN'T TO THE HOUSE OR TO THE IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR OF THAT HOUSE. THE HOUSE WILL EACH INDIVIDUAL HOUSE WILL THEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND AS THEY SEE FIT BASED ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THERE WILL BE WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EXPERTS YOU KNOW GIVEN -- YOU KNOW WITH THEIR BACKGROUND IN LAW AND IN OUR POLICIES THEN. YEAH EACH HOUSE WILL THEN HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. THE CURRENT POLICY RELATED TO DISCLOSURE RELATING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT WILL BE MAINTAINED WHICH IS SERIOUS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SENIOR STAFF AND MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RELEASED -- BUT AS WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO PARSE OUT NOW REPORTING AT A MUCH EARLIER PHASE OF THINGS THAT FALL BELOW THE LEVEL OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER TYPES OF WORST PLACE RUMINATION. THAT AS AND WITH ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES MATTERS WILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH EMPLOYEES AND THOSE. ARC CONSIDER CHIN NOT RISE TO THAT LEVEL. OF OF BEING SERIOUS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IS THE BASIC FRAMEWORK OF THE POLICY WITH OF COURSE SOME DETAILS TO BE FILLED IN BUT IT'S VERY MUCH A SEA CHANGE FROM WHAT'S DONE NOW. FOR ONE THING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BICAMERAL UNIT WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY DONE. THAT BI CAMERAL UNIT WILL ASK FOR FOR WE WILL ASK OUR EMPLOYEES TO REPORT ON A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF INCIDENTS THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE PAST. AND WE WILL ALSO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PANEL FOR THE FIRST TIME OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO WILL INVESTIGATE WILL LOOK INTO EVERYONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS BASED ON ALL INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED FROM INVESTIGATORS. FROM THEM THE I EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES WHO WILL DISCUSS EACH INCIDENT AND RECOMMEND THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE BASED ON THEIR YEARS OF WORK IN THIS FIELD -- THAT'S THE BASIC FRAMEWORK ALL LAST SENATOR MITCHELL OF SHE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD. TRYING TO DISTILL WAS A VERY LARGE POLICY DOWN INTO A KIND OF BITE SIZE PIECES BUT THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE FROM WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD I REALLY IN SUMMARY IS RECOGNIZING. I THINK THE TWO PRIMARY TAKEAWAYS -- AND THE GOAL IS BOTH THE INTEGRITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS THE FACT FINDING PROCESS. AND THE INTEGRITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IF YOU WILL OF OF WHAT. WAS ULTIMATELY DONE WITH THE INVESTIGATORS NO FACTUAL FINDINGS. AND CREATING THIS UNIT. THAT -- WILL ENGAGE IN THAT WORK ON BEHALF OF BOTH HOUSES. AND DEVELOPING THIS PANEL CREATES -- I FEEL AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT ROLE WE PLAY AS A LEGISLATURE. BOMB AND CREATING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY TO HELP INFORM OUR DECISIONS AGAIN -- TO MAINTAIN INTEGRITY AND CONSISTENCY ON BOTH THE INVESTIGATION SIDE AS WELL AS THE RULE MAKING I THINK FOR ME. TO CONCEPTUALLY WALK AWAY WITH TWO NEW CONCEPTS THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD FRAME IT -- AND AGAIN THAT. BY THE SLY MEMBER STOP WITH THE HEARINGS THAT WE ALL PARTICIPATED IN. KEY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THAT WE ALL HEARD FROM. AND TAKING ALL THAT INFORMATION AND DISTILLING THAT WITHIN OUR OWN UNIQUE STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK HERE WE FELT OF IT REALLY WAS THE BEST PLAN TO ALLOW US. TO GO FORWARD -- RECOGNIZING OUR ROLE AS EMPLOYERS AND ALL OF US AND EMPLOYEES AS WELL. IT IMPACTS ALL OF US UNDER THE DOME. YEAH AND ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IT ALSO BEARS -- POINTING OUT THAT THIS PROCESS IS THE SAME FOR MEMBERS AND FOR EMPLOYEES IT WILL BE THE SAME PROCESS WILL BE ASKING FOR THE SAKE REPORTING OF THE SAME TYPES OF INCIDENTS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE ARE ASKING OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE SUBJECTED TO BE SUBJECTED. TO AND THAT'S IMPORTANT -- WE EXPECT THE SAME IF NOT BETTER BEHAVIOR HERE FROM LEGISLATORS AND WE SHOULD. AS YOUR EMPLOYEES AND THE PANEL WHEN THEY WE HEAR EVIDENCE WILL BE TREATING US IN MAKING THE SAME RECOMMENDATIONS AS THEY WOULD FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON WHAT OUR POLICY IS AND WHAT THE LAW IS. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COMMENTS ARE SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'D FIRST WANT THINK MADAM CHAIR MADAM VICE CHAIR THIS WAS A LOT OF WORK AND TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND BUT HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS AND I THINK HOW BEING. POLICIES IN PLACE SINCE I WAS ELECTED FOUR YEARS AGO SOMETHING HAS ALWAYS STRUCK ME IS THAT. WERE LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LITTLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO MANY OUT FOLKS WERE ELECTED NEVER HAD A STAFF BEFORE AND SO THEY'RE PRACTICING IF YOU WILL WITH THEIR STAFF THAT THEY HAVE HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVER STARTS OUT WITH BAD INTENTIONS BUT PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW SO I THINK HAVING A FRAMEWORK AND HAVING IT BE BY CAMEL THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT STRUCK ME WAS WHEN I WAS ELECTED. HOW WE DO THINGS SO SEPARATELY EVEN THE WORD ENDEAVORING TO CREATE LAWS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE TOGETHER SO I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE DOING THIS AS A BY CAMEL UNIT? AND AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT I THINK THAT THE THAT RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT -- AS BAD AS I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT TOUCH ON WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL SAID I THINK THAT -- WE ALWAYS WANT MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE BUT THAT IS OUR CHALLENGE FOR EVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE APATHY IN SOCIETY PEOPLE DON'T WANT VOTE SO GETTING SOMEONE TO FILL OUT A SURVEY ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE EASY BUT WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. AND I JUST WANT PEOPLE THROUGH AGAIN AND EVERYONE THE COMMITTEE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND VITAL WORK AND I THINK THESE ARE REAL STEPS THAT ARE GONNA MOVE US FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MEMBER DALY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN VICE CHAIR I JUST ONE OF THE FIRST FALL. TAKE EVERY MEMBER ON THIS PANEL FOR TAKING THE TIME AND NO I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY MISS ANY TIME AND THAT'S RARE AROUND HERE. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M. EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WHAT'S THE PROCESS FROM HERE FORWARD NOW I'M THIS LOOKING AT WHAT. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SO HOW HOW DO SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. AS I HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG THAT. WE NEED A GREAT OF I HEARD WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT CULTURE WHICH WE ALL AGREED WE NEED. TO HAVE THAT CULTURE CHANGED HERE WE ALSO -- HEARD A LOT ABOUT TRUST AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A PROCESS THAT'S IN PLACE THAT TOM OUR EMPLOYEES. AND US AS WELL HAVE A PLACE TO GO -- THAT WE CAN TRUST THE PROCESS AND SO WHEN THERE WHEN I SEE THAT THAT THAT RETAIN THEIR WHAT THE THE ONE WHICH HAS RETAIN HOUSE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE SO I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS -- WHO BUT SO I THE FOLKS FROM? THE LA COUNTY CAME TO MY OFFICE AND SAT DOWN AND I REALLY -- I THINK THEY HAVE A GREAT SYSTEM THERE AND YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE HERE BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT SO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. MANY DIFFERENT SUPERVISORS IN MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND THEY ALSO HAVE OF FIVE PERSON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT IS AT THE TOP AYE I GUESS IS THE LACK DID AND THEN THEY HAVE YOU KNOW MANY -- CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES THAT ARE IN THERE COUNTY THAT ARE HAVE ELECTED POSITIONS TO BUT IT IS DIFFERENT THAN. THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AS A SENATOR LEYVA IT. SAID DIFFERENT BUSINESSES BASICALLY AND AHEAD OF THAT IS EACH ELECTED. REPRESENTATIVE SO IT'S IT IS DIFFERENT. SO WE HAVE TO CRAFT THE POLICY THAT -- HAS TRUST AND HAS SOME. ABILITY TO BE ABLE. TO BRING ALL THE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND IT IN AND IN A WAY THAT. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. ON IT AT THAT PROCESS IS NOT IS FAIL PROOF SO IT WENT WHEN I HAD LIKE A LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION ON HOW YOU. SEE THIS PANEL OPERATING AND THEN IF SOMEBODY CAME FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THAT PANEL ON HOW HOW WOULD THAT BE. HANDLED. WELL I WILL SAY FIRST THAT GAINING TRUST I'M. WERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TRUST. AND SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES WE KNOW. DON'T DON'T TRUST US THAT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND THERE'S NO POLICY WE'RE GOING TO PUT INTO PLACE THAT'S GOING TO OVERNIGHT. CHANGE THAT SO -- BUTTON I THINK YOU SEEN MAJOR STEPS BEING TAKEN IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS GETTING TRUST. SEEING US PUT POLICIES INTO PLACE THAT WE'RE WILLING TO BE SUBJECTED. TO AND THAT -- STARTS TO WORK. AND WE WILL HAVE TO CUT WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW AS WE PUT THIS INTO PLACE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE AND DONE YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO TWEAK IT FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT -- WE'LL DO A CULTURE SURVEY MAYBE SIX MONTHS AFTER WE INSTITUTE THE POLICIES AND GET A SENSE OF OUR EMPLOYEES HOW IT'S WORKING AND SO THAT WILL TAKE TIME. I IN TERMS OF HOW THE PANEL WORKS IT'S MY HOPE [inaudible] THAT SUPERVISORS AND OTHERS IN THE DECISION MAKING POSITIONS WILL TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PANEL VERY SERIOUSLY. ARE THE PANEL ARE NOT EMPLOYEE ARE NOT EMPLOYEES THERE UNDER CONTRACT US BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE HOUSED. HERE IN TERMS OF WORKING HERE SO IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM I THINK TO KIND OF HAVE CARTE BLANCHE IN TO BE. CHECKED IT SHOULD NOT BE THE TO BE BEYOND IT MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY OF SUPERVISORS AT THE EMPLOYEES THAT NEED TO ACT ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE WORKING DAY TO DAY WITH THE STAFF AND LA COUNTY THAT'S HOW THEIR SYSTEM WORKS IN THIS IS MODEL VERY MUCH ON THAT WERE THEIR PANELS. MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND 98% OF THE TIME THEY SAY THEY ARE FOLLOWED BUT OCCASIONALLY A SUPERVISOR WILL COME IN AND SAY. HERE'S WHY WE HAVE TO TWEAK THIS ARE HERE'S WHY WE DISAGREE AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEIR THE PANEL IS NOT THEIR DAY TO DAY TO TO BE IN THOSE OFFICES. BUT I IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE ALSO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF AGREEMENT AND CONSENSUS AND WORK WITH OUR PANEL OTHERWISE THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT TO HAVING THEM THERE IF WE DON'T ACT ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. SENATOR MITCHELL HAD IN. I HEAR YOUR QUESTION MISTER DALI AND IT'S ABOUT ONE AND ONE THAT WE CAN GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. AND I I MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU A LITTLE I THINK WHILE LA COUNTY'S NUMBERS ARE LARGER THE DYNAMIC WITH THAT MADE IT APPEALING I THINK FOR US. AND OF ALL THE MODELS WE LOOKED AT THE MOST RELEVANT IT WAS IT WAS A WORK FOR AN ELECTED BODY. SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ONE TWENTY THEIR FIVE IT'S STILL THE DYNAMIC OF THE WORK FORCE AN ELECTED BODY. AND THAT THEY'VE. BEEN ABLE TO APPLY IT. TO THEIR HIT OF OR UNIVERSE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE MANY. OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE CIVIL SERVANTS VERSUS OUR SERVER THE PLEASURE BUT EVEN NAY THE ELECTED. MEMBERS OF THE BOARD HAVE SEVERED THE PLEASURE PLEASE SO AGAIN IT WAS A MODEL THAT WE THOUGHT. APPLY BECAUSE IT WOULD IMPACT BOTH THE ELECTED [inaudible] AND STAFF. I THINK IT'S AGAIN WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADD ME TO THIS. SKELETON OF A FRAMEWORK -- AND THE PANEL WILL BE EMPOWERED. TAKE THE INVESTIGATIONS AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION YOU HELD. THAT THE WELL WE ARE INCORPORATING THIS INTO AN EXISTING KIND OF LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK SOME THAT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES BUT SENATE RULES IN ASSEMBLY RULES. SO WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON HOW WE INCORPORATE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS INTO OUR DECISION MAKING -- PROCESS AND BODY AS AN INSTITUTION THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES SENSE THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. DO YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP TO I'M SORRY I I DIDN'T LOOK BACK. AT SOME OF THE RETALIATES SO. THE GOAL OF THE GAME MY MIND IS THAT. WE WANT TO GET AS CLOSE. TO PERFECT THE FIRST SHOT AS WE CAN AND THAT SO THAT'S MY SOAP ON THIS PANEL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY NON PARTISAN NON POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. IN TERMS OF THE THE PANEL ITSELF YOU AND JUST THE WHOLE PROCESS BERMAN FOR MY LACK OF A BETTER MEAN TO ME TO BETTER THE THE BEST SCENARIO WOULD BE. WHERE WE CAN GET THIS -- FOR REMOVED FROM POLITICS AND PARTISANSHIP AS POSSIBLE AGREE GO THAT'S THAT'S MY GOAL IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT AND HAVE INTEGRITY AND SO I'M SO HOW THE PANEL GETS PICKED AND HOW THE PANEL AND HOW. THE RECOMMENDATIONS MOVE FORWARD IF THE IF THERE'S AT THE YES I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IF THE PANELISTS ALL. OLD PEOPLE PICKED FROM THE PUBLIC OR SOME FROM THE BOARD FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE IF IT'S RULES THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT. AND I CAN WEIGH IN ON WHETHER I WAS SO MY GOAL IS TO GET IS THAT IS. FOR I WANT A NONPARTISAN NON POLITICAL. AND I DON'T WAS A MORE AT ALL H. R. POLICIES FOR A WORKPLACE MUST BE. NO QUESTION NO QUESTION IN ANY OF OUR MINDS -- WHEN THE WE HAVE ENGAGED IN BEGUN TO PICK THE BRAIN OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE? FROM HER PERSPECTIVE TO WEIGH IN ON IT WHAT IS SHE THINK IN TERMS OF A PURELY -- LOOKING AT A PANEL OF INFORMED PEOPLE WHO COULD PROVIDE US GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION ON THE FACT [inaudible] TO THEM. PART OF FISH IT. SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT PLAY A ROLE IN ANY OF OUR HR PRACTICES. OR POLICIES PLEASE NO QUESTION AND SO WE'VE LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF WAYS TO GET TO THESE FIVE PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT NUMBER WOULD BE APPOINTED BY WHAT GROUP. AND HOW TO FRAME THAT AND AND THERE'S BEEN OUTREACH TO HER TO HAVE HER LOOK AT THIS NEW POLICY WHERE DEVELOPING TO HAVE THE SECRET COUNCILS WELL WE THOUGHT SHE WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE. PERSON -- TO DO THAT. ALSO ANNA THAT I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER ASKS TRYING TO SEE IF ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED SUCCESSFULLY ON THE PANEL IN LA COUNTY COME AND BE PART OF OUR AT LEAST OUR INITIAL PANEL. TO HELP GIVE GUIDANCE TO THOSE WHO ARE ARE STARTING A THING. BECAUSE WE ALL S. THERE SEEMS TO BE BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG THE COMMITTEE HERE. THAT LA COUNTY'S MODEL WORKS WELL. AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD HELP. AS IN TERMS OF TRAINING OUR PANEL. I'M MOVING ON TO SENATOR BATES. YEAH FINE AGAIN LET ME I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE GRATITUDE THANK YOU TO OUR CHAIRS AND CERTAINLY TO THE STAFF. I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE DO STILL DISTILLATION IS THAT A WORD OF GOD THE MANIA WEEKS I IN INFORMATION THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD TO ALL OF US ON THE PANEL I WHEN I START GOING THROUGH AND I THOUGHT. HOW WE GONNA PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER SO AYE AMAZING AYE JOB I DO I WANT TO SPEAK AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DON'T WE DID ABOUT THE PANEL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S FINE CERTAINLY A VERY CRITICAL? COMPONENT OF THIS AND I KNOW. THEIR PANELS OF THREE SEEM TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP AMONGST THEM SO THAT THEY THEIR DECISIONS WERE BASED ON A UNANIMOUS ALL THREE SO I JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT. WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE. TWO PANELS OF THREE SO WE HAVE SIX RATHER THAN FIVE SWORE MOVING THOSE PEOPLE IN AND OUT BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS GET THREE AND THEN TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE LAST DECISION. AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE COME IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THEM SEEM TO ME THAT THEY HAD. THE THREE THREE AND THREE SO IF THREE THAT SERVED ON THIS PANEL A WERE NOT AVAILABLE THEY MOVED TO PANEL B. OR C.. SO THAT THEY KEPT THE SAME THREE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. IS ACCURATE BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE ALL. KIND OF VIEWING THINGS ON YOU. IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THREE UNANIMOUS DECISIONS I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU GET OF FEELING AMONGST YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE WORKING TOGETHER ON ISSUES LIKE THE IF THE OTHER ITEM. I IT'S NOT COVERED HERE BUT I DON'T THINK WAS INTENDED TO BE COVERED HERE BUT AGAIN IN THE DISCUSSION. I DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT. WHAT THE NEXT STEP WAS AFTER IT MOVED FROM HARASSMENT INAPPROPRIATE TO PHYSICAL AND THEN A FAULT BECAUSE? I THINK PRESENTLY THAT IMMEDIATELY GOES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT RATHER THEN THROUGH OUR REVIEW PANEL FULL. OP NOT THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT HERE TO DO SOMETHING FOR US TO REMEMBER. THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE. REFERRED BEYOND THE PALACE AND IF THEY COME WITHOUT. INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIECE THAT PROBABLY ISN'T AN ISSUE BUT JUST TO PUT IT ON OUR RADAR. BUT THANK YOU AGAIN AND I THINK GOD IT'S ALL BEEN. EXCEPTIONAL ON THE JOB HIM INTO A DAY OUT -- I'M NOT SURE WE UNDERSTOOD INITIALLY WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THAT CERTAINLY A WE DID AND IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THANKS AGAIN. WELL THANK YOU AND I I DO BELIEVE THAT OF LOS ANGELES THEY HAVE THEIR NINE PANELISTS AND THEN THOSE PANELS OF THREE THEY ROTATE THEM AROUND ACTUALLY NOT THE SAME THING THAT THEY TRY TO NOT HAVE THEM. ALWAYS BE THE SAME PEOPLE. I GUESS WITH ONLY NINE BECAUSE THEY MEET TWICE A WEEK THEY END UP THAT. THEY WORK WITH EACH OTHER SO OFTEN BUT THEY ARE WORKING WITH. ALL OF THE ALL OF THE EIGHT OTHER ONES FROM WEEK TO WEEK BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO THREE THREE THREE ONE YOU GOT. FIVE YOU GOT PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE DUPLICATED ON A PANEL FILLING IT AND THAT'S ALL I'M THINKING. FAIR ENOUGH YEAH THANK YOU YES. IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL ACTION I BELIEVE LA COUNTY REFERRERS TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IF CRIMINAL ACTS -- IF IT IS BEEN DEEMED THAT A CRIME WAS COMMITTED. THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT EXPLICITLY STATED TO ME THAT IN THE PARLOR WINDOWS PROTECTIONS. AND ALSO PAYS ATTENTION TO THE PERPETRATOR GAS WHAT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THIS NICE PANEL THING AND COME OUT IF IF IT ACTUALLY STEPPED OVER THE LINE GOT. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMORY AS THANK YOU I TO WANT TO JOIN THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND THINKING. OF JERICHO CHAIR. OF THE IT AND YOU'RE RIGHT MR. WHERE I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANY ABSENCES AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK WE'LL TOOK THIS? VERY SERIOUSLY WE KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO BE ENGAGED -- AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEARINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING AND TODAY'S VERY SPECIFIC. ONE IF IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE CHANGE. TO THE INSTITUTION TO RESPOND TO THE HARASSMENT I THINK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE. AND OUTSIDE. AND WHAT THE QUESTIONS ALLOW STE AND I ASKED THE QUESTION REGARDING THE LOBBYISTS AND THE OUTSIDE -- HARASSMENT BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. SURPRISED ME QUITE FRANKLY. THAT THAT WAS A FINDING THAT SURPRISED ME AND SO I WANT TO BE SURE THAT. IN OUR IT THE WAY WE ADDRESS THIS I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE. SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES IT THE HARASSMENT THAT OUR STAFF FEELS FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES WITH OUR BE LOBBYISTS OR THE PUBLIC -- I AM VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. BUT OUR OUR OUR EMPLOYEES WITH ONE ANOTHER HAVE WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY DO FEEL THEY CAN TRUST THEIR SUPERVISORS. IT'S THE PROCESS. THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE BREAK IT WERE WERE ALL COMMUNICATION BREAKS DOWN BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THE PROCESS. AND IS GOING BACK TO THE CULTURE THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT SO I THINK THAT THAT. THE TRAINING. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S AS MUCH OF A COMPLAINT REGARDING THE TRAINING IT'S WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE REPORT IS MADE. AND KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO COME FROM THAT SO I THINK THAT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS OF OF THE PANEL AND SUBJECT MATTER MEMBERS. IS SO IMPORTANT AND I AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR SHARING THAT EXPERIENCE WITH US. AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SAW. AS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EMULATE IN THE BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BEGIN TO GAIN THAT TRUST. THAT THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT HAVE -- WITH OUR WORKERS WHEN THEY DO GIVE THEIR COMPLAINTS. I AM LOOKING FORWARD. TO THE NEXT UP WITHOUT A DOUBT HOLISTIC APPROACH -- THAT WILL COVER ALL THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR OUR FOR OUR EMPLOYEES WHERE THE EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE SO I THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SUMMER WALTER. THANK MADAM CHAIR -- DID ALL THE COMMENTS OF EVERYONE SO FAR -- I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE -- AS DEEP IN ISSUE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS IT IS -- THE OTHER THING IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN WORKING AND IS KIND OF BEEN VETTED THROUGH IN. LOS ANGELES IS HELPING US TAKE A STEP UP SO WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. AND WE CAN LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT. AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW HOW THEY RUN THEIR OPERATION AND WE ARE DIFFERENT AND THOSE THINGS WILL EVOLVE AS WE WORK ON IT. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REALLY BRIEF -- ON THE YOU KNOW THE THE GOAL OF HAVING PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE TO REPORT AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO REPORT. PHAM WHAT HAPPENS IN ON LOOKING AT THIS THE HAND THAT WE HAVE -- ON SECTION. THREE FOR TALKS ABOUT THE SYSTEM REPORTS IMMEDIATELY BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. SO IF ARE YOU. REPORT A CLAIM. AT WHAT POINT TO I GET ANY STATUS BACK OR IS THERE A CASE NUMBER ASSIGNED OR MAYBE A FEW NO IS IT MORE -- CONFIDENTIAL IN THAT THEY GET A CASE NUMBER AND NOT THEIR NAME ALWAYS ASSOCIATED OR WHAT KIND OF TRACK IS OUR TRACKING NUMBER. YOU KNOW CAN IS THERE SOME WAY SOMEONE CAN SIGN ON AND LOOKED TO SEE GENE OKAY NOW IT'S BEEN ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE OR STATUS. PENDING MORE AT WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT WILL POINT TO THE GET UPDATES OR DO THEY HAVE TO WAIT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. JUST THANK YOU. FOR SUBMITTING AND THEN NOTHING UNTIL THE END. I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW HOW THAT'S HANDLED. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF CREATING THIS NEW INVESTIGATIVE UNIT WILL ALSO BE TO EMPOWER THEM TO INFORM US ON THE DRILL DOWN IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SETTING POLICY SAYING. WE WANT EMPLOYEES TO BE IN UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT FRANKLY IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GET TO A LEVEL OF DETAIL WILL WE'RE GONNA SAY AND THIS IS HOW YOU'LL DO IT MISTER MISS INVESTIGATOR ASSIGNING CASE NUMBER BLAHBLAH BLAH I THINK THOSE ARE. THINGS THAT WE CAN SAY TO THEM BUT AGAIN I THINK. OUR ROLE HOPEFULLY WILL BE TO ESTABLISH THIS UNIT WHERE -- OUR GOALS ARE EXPECTATIONS OF THE OUTCOME I THINK THE HOW WILL BE LEFT UP TO THAT UNIT TO INFORM US IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES OUT ENOUGH CASE NUMBERS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. THAT'S WHY WE WANTED A HIRE INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE TO PROVIDE US WITH. CLEAR FOR CATION SUGGESTIONS ON THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD ADVISE THAT WE DO IT YEAH YOU KNOW WE'RE CLEAR AS WE HEARD THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS THAT. THAT ON ANONYMITY IS SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REALITY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WANTING TO COME FOR BUT NOT WILLING. TO NAME SO IT WILL BE UP TO THOSE INVESTIGATORS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE THAT BALANCE BUT I THINK. WE WILL SEND THEM THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE NEED EMPLOYEES INFORMED ABOUT THE PROCESS AS APPROPRIATE. THROUGHOUT NINE YEAH ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE WILL BE INFORMED. AS SENATOR MITCHELL SAID WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT'S GOING YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT PROCESS WILL BE BUT IT WON'T BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE SUBMIT A REPORT YOU KNOW UNDER THEIR NAME AND DON'T HEAR BACK FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS I MEAN WE WILL LET THEM. KNOW WHAT THE TRIAGE SORT OF IN YEAH SAYS AND AND THEN SOME EXPECTATION OF TIME AND CERTAINLY WHEN THERE'S BEEN A RESPONSE THEY'LL BE NOTIFIED THAT THERE'S BEEN A RESPONSE. I AND WE ALSO JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE I DIDN'T SAY IT IN MY PRESENTATION WE WILL BE ACCEPTING. ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AND WE WILL INVESTIGATE THOSE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS AN EMPLOYER. TO INVESTIGATE ARE ALL COMPLAINTS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER TYPES OF DISCRIMINATION SO THOSE WILL BE INVESTIGATED BUT CLEARLY IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO ONE TO REPORT BACK. TO OKAY -- AND THEN. JUST THIS MAY BE JUST A TECHNICAL. YOU JUST CERTAIN NOT EVEN A TYPO BUT MORE OF THE WAY IT WAS WORDED. THE ACTUAL -- DRAFT OF POLICY. ON THE C. FUND PAID SEVEN AND OUR HAND THOUGH [inaudible] SAYS [inaudible] THAT WHERE'S WE HAVE SO MANY PAPERS HERE. THAT THE SUPERVISOR. A PAID SEVEN AT THE BOTTOM IT'S A SUPERVISORS INCLUDING MEMBERS MUST REPORT ANY COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT. TO THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT IMMEDIATELY. BUT YET IN OUR THE HANDLE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGE TWO IT'S A SUIT SUPERVISORS SHOULD REPORT AND IT MAY JUST BE SEMANTICS I MEAN I WOULD GO WITH THE POLICY WHAT THAT SAYS. THAT THE REPORT NOT THAT THEY SHOULD. BUT WAS OKAY ON THEN REALLY QUICKLY MOVE NUMBER THAT JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF HOPEFULLY WILL BE BRIEF -- WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW IN THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT -- WHEN THINGS ARE DISCLOSED THAT THE HOUSE OF BASICALLY RULES? WILL RELEASE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS IN CASES WHERE THE PANEL DETERMINES THAT FACTS RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIATED. AGAINST A MEMBER OR A HIGH LEVEL LEGISLATIVE. EMPLOYEES SO ONCE IT'S GONE THROUGH THAT INDEPENDENT. PANEL THEY'VE MADE A RECOMMENDATION FOUND IT TO BE SUBSTANTIVE. THEN RIGHT NOW OUR POLICY DRAFT IS STATING THAT IT COMES BACK TO RULES WILL DETERMINE IF THEY ACCEPT OR NOT ACCEPT. AND THAT ONE POINT THAT WOULD BECOME PUBLIC IF IT'S SUBSTANTIATED [inaudible] I'M. IF THEY IF SAY RULES DECIDES NOT TO ACCEPT. EVEN THOUGH THE CAN THE PANEL SAYS IT'S SUBSTANTIATED. SHOULD I WOULD ASSUME BE STILL MADE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEN. RULES WOULD HAVE TO STTE WHY. DECLINED AT SOME POINT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE. BECAUSE AND IT GOES BACK TO THE CONCERN. OF BEING POLITICAL YOU KNOW IF WE COULD KEEP IT AS MUCH AS ARM'S LENGTH. IT'S SHOULD ALMOST BE IF IT COMES BACK FROM THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE UNIT AS BEING SUBSTANTIATE IT MUST BE MET OR SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE'S TWO SEPARATE PARTS TO WHAT THE PANEL WILL BE LOOKING AT ONE IS WHETHER IT'S A VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY. AND AT WHAT LEVEL. THAT IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A VIOLATION OF OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENTPOLICY. FOR SENIOR STAFF AND MEMBERS THAT WILL BE THIS SECOND PART IS THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS THE RECOMMENDED ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND THAT BY OUR POLICY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WILL GO BACK TO THE EACH REPRESENTATIVE EACH OF SEPARATE HOUSE FOR DETERMINATION OF WHETHER. TO BASICALLY FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE DISCIPLINE OR THE RESPONSE. SO THAT THEY CAN THEY PANEL WOULD SAY THESE OF SUBSTANTIATED THAT IT WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT INSTANTIATED THEN. THE HOUSE RULES WOULD SAY THEY ACCEPT OR REJECT. FOR SENIORS OFTEN FOR MEMBERS THAT'S THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION -- THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION AND I'M PUTTING FORWARD TO ALL OF YOU THAT THAT THAT THERE'S THIS TWO SEPARATE ELEMENTS ONE IS THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY AND IF SO WHAT LEVEL IS A JUST A VIOLATION OF ARE. INTERNAL COULD CONDUCT OR DOES IT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND IT'S THOSE THAT RISE TO THAT LEVEL OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT WOULD BE DISCLOSED TO THE PRESS THE SECOND PART IS THE PANEL WITH THAT ALSO SAY. THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY AT SUCH AND SUCH A LEVEL AN HOUR RECOMMENDED RESPONSES AND I WOULD THINK WITH MEMBERS YOU KNOW IT IT MAY NOT BE SO SPECIFIC IT MIGHT JUST BE TRAINING. OR MIGHT BE SOME LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE TO BE DETERMINED. WHATEVER THAT THEN GOES TO THE RESPECTIVE HOUSES TEND TO TO IMPLEMENT OKAY. GOOD BECAUSE YET AND I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THAT SO FOR CLARIFICATION IT HELPS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE POLITICS TO PLAY IN THE MIDDLE WHAT GETS THE SCHOOLS AND WHAT THOSE. THAT THAT WAS THE BIGGEST QUESTION I HAVE HOME QUICKLY -- IF THE RULES COMMITTEE -- DEVIATES FROM WHAT THE PANEL RECOMMENDS -- DOES. DOES THE ACCUSER OR DOES THE THE VICTIM BASICALLY GET TO KNOW THAT. BUT WHAT POINT. AND YOU KNOW AND RESOLUTION OF THIS WOULD THE ACTUAL COMPLAINT AND GET TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULT WAS AS FAR AS THE PUNISHMENT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT -- WHAT'S DISCLOSED TO THE REPORTING PARTY IS PROBABLY GOING TO VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF INCIDENT THAT IT IS. WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S NOT I THINK IT'S I I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A POLICY THAT SAYS. IN EVERY CASE WHAT VICTIMS WILL BE TOLD HIM WHAT THEY WANT YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES BUT THEY WILL KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RESPONSE THEY WILL KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATION -- THEY WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPLAINTS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY NO IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSE YOU KNOW MOST OF MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE GOING TO COME IN ARE NOT. PROBABLY GONNA BE. MET YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE TO EMPLOYEE AND THERE'S ALSO THERE IS SOME CONFIDENTIALITY THAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE YOU MAY IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO GO TO SOMEONE WHO COMPLAIN AND SAY YES IT WAS SUBSTANTIATED. AND THEY'RE GETTING FOUR DAYS OF TRAINING AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL I THINK WE HAVE TO SORT OF SEPARATE THAT IN SOME THINGS WILL BE -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT WHETHER THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHETHER IT WAS A VIOLATION OF POLICY WILL BE DISCLOSED. SO THEY WOULD GET AT LEAST THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW THE RESOLUTION. ALL BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE DETAIL YEAH WILL BE TOLD THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED THERE'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN A RESPONSE. AND THAT I THINK THAT'S IN KEEPING WITH WHAT PROBABLY WHAT MOST EMPLOYERS AND OF DOING YOU KNOW. THE ALLEGATION INCIDENT HEARD IT WAS A VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY AND WE HAVE RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY. YES SENATOR MITCH I'M I'M GONNA LET HER SKIP THE PLEASE FORGIVE ME COLLEAGUES IM GONNA ASK YOUR INDULGENCE ALLOW ME TO SKIP THE LINE I SHOULD BE GAMBLING DOWN SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. SO LET ME I'M JUST QUICKLY SAY I WANT TO THANK ON THE SENATE SIDE THE STAFF JUST IN DIANNE WHO PUT. COUNTLESS OF OURS IN THEIR ATTENTION TO DETAIL INTO THIS PROCESS. THE ONE THING I DIDN'T WANT US. TO TO LEAVE ALL HERE WITHOUT -- AT LEAST BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT. ARE TO THE CLIMATE SATURDAY AND HOW WE ROLE THAT OUT AND SHARE IT WITH THE EMPLOYEES WHO THE DATA IS THERE THAT THERE CLIMATE SURVEY. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS PER SE BUT ONE SUGGESTION I WOULD MAKE. FOR FOLLOW UP IS THAT PARTICULARLY DO YOU KNOW TO HONOR WHAT WE HEARD EMPLOYEE SANTAM THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISOR. IS IN THE NEXT CHIEFS OF STAFF UPDATE WHICH PERHAPS COULD BEAT CHAIRED THAT THE CHIEF OF STAFF ARE GIVEN THE FOLD OUT AND WE ASK THE CHIEFS. TO THE END ROLE THAT OUT TO ALL OF THEIR TEAM MEMBERS -- WOULDN'T TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT NEXT STEPS BUT IT BUT THAT WOULD BE THE SUGGESTION I MAKE IN TERMS OF HOW. THAT THE EMPLOYEES DATA ROLLS OUT TO THE EMPLOYEES. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND I KNOW WE HAVE SENATOR MORE LOCKING THAT WE DO OF THE PUBLIC TO HEAR FROM AS WELL SO I'M GONNA GO TO SENATOR MORE LOCKING MAYBE ASK MY COLLEAGUES MUCH OF ANYTHING PRESSING TO WAIT UNTIL WE ARE FOR THE PUBLIC. IN THAT WE CAN FINISH UP. THANK YOU SENATOR TO MAKE YOU THINK YOU MATTER CHERRY -- WE HAVE THIS SLIDE IT SAYS RECOMMENDATIONS. IF I PLAY BACK THE TAPE I HEARD THIS IS THE NEW. POLICY AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT IS OUR COMMITTEE ROLE NOW. DO WE VOTE ON IT WE HAVE SOME BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO DEAL WITH. PARTICULAR TOPIC ARE WE DOING A BILL -- ORDERS THIS ADMINISTRATIVELY JUST HANDLED BY EACH. OF THE HOUSES RULES COMMITTEES THEY JUST. PUT FIVE IS. YEAH NOW UP THE PROCESS QUESTIONS YEAH I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR GOING TO BE ON THE INDEPENDENT PANEL -- WHAT'S THE SELECTION AND COMPENSATION PROCESS -- AT THE COUNTY OF ORANGE RED SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT THEY WERE INTERNALLY WERE DEPARTMENT HEADS. COUNTY COUNCIL. A SAWED. MAYBE THAT YOU CAN GIVE US LATER WELL I'LL TO START BACKWARDS QUICKLY THAT THE PANEL WERE STILL DISCUSSING HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE APPOINTED AND WHO AND BY WHOM WERE SPEAKING TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE FOR INSTANCE AND SO THAT'S UNDER DISCUSSION. THEY WILL NOT BE EMPLOYEES THEY WILL BE UNDER CONTRACT THEY WILL BE COMPENSATED IN SOME WAY -- WE THE NEW THE CREATING THE BICAMERAL UNIT WILL BE A NEW. TO AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY WILL BE FUNDED AND THEY WILL BE STAFFED TO WHAT LEVEL WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT COULD CHANGE OVER TIME IF WE FEEL THAT WE NEED MORE PEOPLE IN THAT DEPARTMENT BUT THAT WILL BE A NEW BY CAROL DEPARTMENT UNDER LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. UNDER THAT UMBRELLA BUT IT WILL BE A SEPARATE UNIT. SO I WOULD OFF SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY -- IN TERMS OF PROCESS. TODAY WE'RE WE'RE I'M HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU WE WILL MEET ON THURSDAY FOR US. TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS POLICY THAT WE SEE FIT BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS WE WILL VOTE ON IT. IT WILL THEN GO TO JOINT RULES NEXT WEEK TO BE ADOPTED FOR THAT BY THEM WE DO NOT NEED LEGISLATION FOR THIS THIS IS AN INTERNAL POLICY. SO ONCE JOINT RULES ADOPTS IT OR ANY MAKES ANY CHANGES THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE AND VOTES ON IT WILL BECOME. THE NEW POLICIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I IN TERMS OF BILLS. FROM THERE RIGHT NOW MAYBE BILLS THAT IMPACT THOSE -- NOT FROM US BUT THERE ARE OUTSIDE MEMBERS WHO MIGHT VERY WELL BE DOING. BILLS THAT WOULD CHANGE THIS I HOPE THAT THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE WENT THROUGH A VERY PUBLIC PROCESS TO GET TO THIS PLACE. AND SOMEONE COMING IN KIND OF FROM THE SIDE SAYING WELL I'M GONNA UNDERMINE ALL OF THAT AND YOU KNOW. JUST TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE UP I WOULD THINK IS A NOT VERY HELPFUL. TO THIS PROCESS -- SO THAT'S THAT'S THE POLICY AYE THAT'S YOUR PROCEDURAL STEPS FROM HERE. SO THAT I'D LIKE TO GO TO OF TO THE PUBLIC TO HEAR FROM THEM. LET THEM LINE UP. IT IS ONLY ONE OR TWO OF YOU YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME UP TO THE PODIUM THE TABLE SAMANTHA CORRAN ON BEHALF OF LEAST ENOUGH TODAY I'M JUST LIKE TO THANK THE CO CHAIRS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK STAFF AS WELL. I'M QUITE A FEW MAN HOURS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THIS EFFORT. AYE SINCE OUR LETTER LAST OCTOBER WE'VE HEARD FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC SERVANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT LITERALLY ALSO ACROSS THE WORLD. AND WHILE MANY OF THEM HAVE SHARED STORIES WITH US ALL OF THEM ARE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES NEXT SO WE JUST WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL EFFORTS HERE AND AND AGAIN THE VOLUME OF TIME AND SERIOUSNESS THAT YOU PUT IN. TO DOING THIS WORK IN AND PUTTING FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS. WE KNOW THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING WORK. ON IT PRESENTS N AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT BOTH IN WORD AND INDEED A TRULY INDEPENDENT PROCESSES ESTABLISHED BUT PEOPLE CONTRAST. I'M IT SO EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT WILL BE ENSURING AND ARTICULATING TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF THAT THIS IS A FAIR PROCESS WHICH WILL PLEASE EQUITY IN SAFETY ABOUT POLITICS. AND IS NOT BEHOLDEN TO THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO BE DEMONSTRATED TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF THROUGH TRANSPARENCY AND OBJECTIVE CAN SEE ON THESE ARE POINTS I KNOW YOU KNOW -- AND AND CERTAINLY A LOT EASIER FOR US TO SAY TO YOU AND THEN TO IMPLEMENT. WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF STAFF OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. ON THERE'S A MIX OF SORT OF ENTHUSIASM SKEPTICISM AYE AND CERTAINLY FEAR. YOU ARE BLESSED TO HAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC POLICY EXPERTS AS YOUR STAFF. PLEASE USE THEM. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS LAW INCLUDING STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU ADD NEED TO THE BONES AT TO TAKE A PAGE FROM. SENATOR MITCHELL AND BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT THAT WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO NOT ONLY ENSURING THEIR BUY IN AND TRUST IN THE PROCESS BUT FRANKLY WE BELIEVE WILL RESULT. IN THE BEST PROCESS -- SOME MAY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING LOBBYISTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. WE WERE NOT -- AS THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD WE CALL ON OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE THIRD HOUSE TO SUPPORT YOUR WORK AND TO PARTICIPATE IN CRAFTING A COMMUNITY WIDE SOLUTION WITH THE NECESSARY JURISDICTION TO HOLD EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR -- LOBBYISTS MUST ASPIRE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN CHANGING THE CULTURE AND NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM SO FOR HOUSE WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AS WELL. AND THINK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE THE SPAR WE LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M JIM WHEN BURGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA ARE. VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PROPOSALS AND ONE AFFECT COMMITTEE FOR THEIR FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT'S WITH REGARDS -- TO THE LOWER LEVEL CONTACT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL BUT JUST THE SAME NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH EARLY ON AND WE REALLY. APPRECIATED THAT DOUG YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT RECOGNIZING THESE PROPER -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT -- THE INCLUSION OF ALTERNATIVE -- RESPONSES AND THE MENTION OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT IT FCL -- WE DO THINK THAT -- WHEN CONDUCTING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE -- PROCESSES THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE IT SHOULD INVOLVE -- V. AGGRESSOR OR OR THE PERPETRATOR THEY NEED TO BE PART OF THAT -- IN ORDER TO GET THE FULLY TRANSFER FORMATIVE A FACT THAT DOES REQUIRE THEM TO ACCEPT AT LEAST SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY -- BEFORE PARTICIPATING. IN HIM DOES THAT KIND OF DIALOGUE -- WERE HAPPY TO HELP THE COMMITTEE AND ASSIST WITH THAT ANYWAY WE CANNOT SO IT DOES NEED TO BE FACILITATED DOES HAVE TO INVOLVE TRAINING. IS NOT JUST TO PEOPLE GETTING INTO A ROOM AND AND AND TALKING ABOUT IT BUT IT DOES REQUIRE SOME COACHING AND TRAINING AND FACILITATION AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL COME BACK TO THE PANEL IF THERE'S ANY CLOSING REMARKS MANY BODY MISTER DALI. THE MINIATURE STILL JUST ONE OF THE LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY CONCERNS I'M VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPOINTEES AND WHO APPOINTS THEM AND HOW WE KEEP THAT -- NON POLITICAL AND THEN ALSO IF. I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE SURE I SO THAT THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY -- FOR SOMEBODY IN ELECTED OFFICE TO BE ABLE. TO GARDER HIDE SOME. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DELIGHTED OUT FROM SO. AND THEN ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IT'S NOT ABUSED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOO SO I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE GET. TO THE PANEL AND HOW THAT PANEL THEN -- OPERATE SO I WILL THEM. DIG A LITTLE DEEPER ON AND HOW I THINK WE WE SHOULD GET THERE AND I'M HOPING THAT TIME. WE COULD HAVE THAT DISCUSSION -- BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT WEEK THAT WHEN WE GET WE FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO TO GET IT IS FURTHER AWAY WITH KEEPING A SECURE WHERE WE WE HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTISANSHIP OR LARA ARE NOT NONPARTISAN I SHOULD SAY WHERE IT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. ASSISTANT CITY AND ALSO THE PERCEPTION AND THE REALITY OF AN UNBIASED PROCESS AND A PROCESS THAT'S FAIR TO BOTH PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING ACCUSED AND PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING -- A REPORTING INCIDENTS -- IS THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WILL MAKE THIS WORK SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS I THANK YOU FOR VOICING THEM I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION BETWEEN NOW AND THURSDAY. AND HOPEFULLY BY THEN WILL HAVE WORKED SOME OF THESE ISSUES OUT TO YOUR SATISFACTION AND THAT WOULD BE MY GOAL. WITH THAT I WILL -- I THANK EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN ON THURSDAY -- TO TO BE VOTING ON THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS -- AND WITHOUT THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED
