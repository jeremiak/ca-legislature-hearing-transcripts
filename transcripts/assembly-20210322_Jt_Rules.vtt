00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.200
ANNEXES- BOTH INADEQUATE AND

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.936
DEFICIENT. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:39.271
ABOUND THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:40.839
AND WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED AN

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.841
ANALYSIS AND SURVEY AND WE HAVE

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.410
IDENTIFIED THOSE MATERIALS AND

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.612
WILL BE REMOVING THEM-

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.081
INADEQUATE BUILDING SYSTEMS ARE

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:51.350
CURRENTLY WITHIN THE- CURRENT

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.985
BUILDING AND AN OUTDATED

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:55.220
SEISMIC DESIGN. THE NEW

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.456
BUILDING WILL HAVE AN UPDATED

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:59.758
DESIGN THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE-

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.860
TYPE OF SEISMICITY THAT ARE IS

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:04.496
NECESSARY. IN ADEQUATE OFFICE

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.665
SPACE WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:07.933
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OFFICE

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.335
SPACE IN THE DESIGN OF THAT

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.936
SPACE IS BOTH EFFICIENT. AND

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:13.539
SAFE. CURRENTLY THE FLOORS ARE

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.507
NOT ALIGNED WITH THE WEST WING

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:16.608
AND THAT CREATES A NUMBER OF

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.644
ISSUES- BOTH EIGHTY A. AS WELL

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.079
THE CIRCULATION AS WELL AS

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.380
COMMUNICATION AND BEING ABLE TO

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.182
DIRECT PEOPLE. AND HELP THEM

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.683
UNDERSTAND WHERE TO GO AND HOW

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.718
TO MOVE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.353
SO WAY FINDING HIS DIFFICULT

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.588
CURRENTLY. FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.856
CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY AMONGST

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.024
THE GREATEST THERE ARE

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:34.860
INADEQUATE EXITS THAT CURRENTLY

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.862
FILLED THE HALLS OF THE ANNEX.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.997
AS WELL AS THE STAIRWAYS. AND

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:40.899
THEN SECURITY AND THE BUILDING

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:43.569
HAS OUT LIVE THE- BUILDING

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.571
CODES WAS BUILT TO. SO YOU THE

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.339
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.173
DESPERATE NEED OF A NEW ANNEX

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.042
BUILDING. THERE IS A LOT OF

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:50.909
THINGS TO TAKE INTO

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.277
CONSIDERATION WHEN DESIGNING AN

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:53.545
ANNEX BUILDING BECAUSE THERE'S

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:55.147
A LOT OF BALANCE THAT HAS TO BE

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:57.149
ACHIEVED BOTH WITH REGARDS TO

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.017
HOW YOU TREAT THE LAND. HOW YOU

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.786
TREAT THE SURROUNDING TREES HOW

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.788
YOU TREAT THE BUILDING. AND HOW

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.623
YOU DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.658
IT'S SAFE AND SECURE. WE

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:07.993
DEVELOPED THREE DIFFERENT

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.728
DESIGNS THERE WAS A DOUBLE T.

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.463
DESIGN A CIRCLE DESIGN IN THE

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.499
SQUARE DESIGN. WE STUDY THE

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.234
ATTRIBUTES AND THE BENEFITS IN

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.302
THE DETRIMENTS OF EACH AND THE

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.471
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. MET SINCE

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.707
SEPTEMBER AND IDENTIFIED THE

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:25.043
DOUBLE T. AS THE SCHEME THAT WE

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.044
WERE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.514
WITH. IT IS A FUNCTIONAL

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.116
DESIGN. IT IS ALSO A DESIGN

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.151
THAT CAN BE BUILT FOR THE

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.920
BUDGET. AND IT IS APPROXIMATELY

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:35.521
FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:39.425
SQUARE FEET- YOU CAN SEE HERE

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.959
THE HOW IT NESTLES IN IT IS

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.761
DESIGNED SO THAT IT WORKS WITH

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.997
BOTH THE TREES IN THE PARK. IT

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:46.832
ALSO REFLECTS AND DESIRE AT THE

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.801
DESIGN OF THE BUILDINGS

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:51.069
DOWNTOWN IT IS NOT I'M OVERLY

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:53.005
MASSIVE BUILDING. IT IS

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:55.841
DESIGNED TO REDUCE ITSELF IN

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.677
THE SITE SO THAT IT. IT SETS

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.747
SUBTLY BEHIND THE WEST WING OR

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.682
THE HISTORIC CAPITAL AND DOES

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.184
NOT OVER POWER THE BUILDING AND

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.920
WE THINK THESE ARE VERY STRONG

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:09.988
ATTRIBUTES OF THIS DESIGN. WE

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:11.390
WILL NOW TURN THE TIME OVER TO

PARK. AS YOU KNOW THE FOOTPRINT

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.360
OF THIS BUILDING IS SURROUNDED.

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:51.029
BY A MANY IMPORTANT TREES- THAT

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.699

EMPLOYMENT BUT IMPLEMENTATION

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.078
OF THE NEW PART AT NEW

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:09.781
BUILDINGS ARE. AND THAT- MY

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:11.550

CONNECT THE EAST SIDE WITH THE

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.683
WEST SIDE OF THE PARK. WE THINK

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.485
THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:51.189

MISS SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:08.707
TREES. ON TOP OF THAT PARKING

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:10.309
THE DESIGN PROPOSES THAT A

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.077
PEDESTRIAN PROMENADE THAT ALSO

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:15.814
CONNECTS. THE NEW NEED EASTERN

WAS THE PEAK OF THE BUILDING

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.210
PULLS AWAY A LITTLE BIT TO

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:47.412
REVEAL MORE OF THE HISTORIC

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.948

PARK ARNIE ARE A VALUABLE-

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.731
CULTURAL COLLECTION THAT

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:42.634
PROVIDES A UNIQUELY CALIFORNIAN

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.402
CHARACTER OF OUR CAPITOL

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:46.171
GROUNDS THIS COLLECTION OF

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:47.839
TREES AND HISTORIC ARTIFACTS.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.341
HAVE A GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:50.375
OUR COLLECTIVE CALIFORNIA

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:52.144
HISTORY AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.746
BE ADDED TO. WE'VE BEEN

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.249
STUDYING THE EXISTING TREES

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.351
WITH OUR ARBORIST FOR MORE THAN

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.420
A YEAR NOW AND I AM HAPPY TO

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.422
REPORT. THAT THE ENTIRE DESIGN

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.190
DESIGN TEAM IS COMMITTED TO THE

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.359
PRIMARY MANDATE TO DISTURB IS

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.294
FEW. OF THE EXISTING TREES AS

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:12.664
POSSIBLE. THE COUPLE PARK IS A

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:13.865
COLLECTION OF TREES THAT

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:15.300
REFLECTS MANY DIFFERENT PERIODS

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.069
OF HISTORY. AS THE CAPITAL

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.704
FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED TO

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.907
ACCOMMODATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS.

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:24.142
HOWEVER THE CAPITOL PARK TREES

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:26.545
ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL. IN

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.681
THIS SLIDE- OF THE EXISTING

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:31.216
SITE YOU CAN SEE THE RELATIVE

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.517
SIZE OF THE TREES SURROUNDING

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:34.453
THE HISTORIC WEST WING TO THE

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.288
WEST NORTH AND THE SOUTH THERE

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:38.857
THERE THE LARGE. REALLY LARGE-

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.860
TREES THAT- CAME ALONG WHEN THE

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:44.396
WEST WING WAS BUILT. BUT YOU

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:46.431
CAN ALSO SEE IN THE PLAN THAT

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.433
THE TREES PLANTED DIRECTLY EAST

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.635
OF THE EXISTING ANNEX. BETWEEN

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.504
THE ANNEX AND TWELFTH STREET.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.805
THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER

00:22:53.872 --> 00:23:02.147
IN SIZE- THESE ARE THE LARGEST

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.483
TREES IN CAPITOL PARK AND THEIR

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.351
PLANET AND- WHEN THE WEST WING

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:14.359
WAS BUILT- AT THE TIME OF THE

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:14.893
NINETEEN FIFTY ANNEX

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.361
CONSTRUCTION THE AUTOMOBILE

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:17.662
RAMPS CREATED A VERY

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:18.697
DESTRUCTIVE BEAR IN THE CAPITOL

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.999
PARK ESSENTIALLY SEPARATING THE

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.934
WEST FROM THE EAST. THE

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.402
ELIMINATION OF THESE RAMPS WILL

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:25.804
ALLOW THE PARK TO BE CONNECTED

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.840
RECONNECTED. TO BE ONE PARK AS

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:35.080
IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED.

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.248
THIS PLAN SHOWS HOW WE'VE

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:37.449
WORKED CAREFULLY TO INSERT THE

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:39.484
NEW BUILDING PROGRAM

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.287
EFFICIENTLY. WITH ONLY WITHIN

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.055
THE AREAS THAT INCLUDE THE

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:33.318
THAT WE NEED TO BUILD LESS AND

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:36.321
THE PARKING IS. EQUIPPED WITH A

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:39.090
STACKER PARKING WHICH- REQUIRES

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.192
LITTLE OVER HALF THE AMOUNT OF

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.261
A STANDARD PARKING SO WE

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.129
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF AREA THE

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:47.298

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:12.770
IS STILL THE INKLING PHASE OF

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:14.471
JUST AN IDEA AND TO SEE THAT

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:15.806
NOW VISUALIZE IN FRONT O US IS

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.341
QUITE EXCITING TO BE ABLE DO

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.909
THIS AND I DO THINK IT'S A

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:19.910
MONUMENT FOR THE FUTURE

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.212
GENERATIONS TO BE TAKE PRIDE IN

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:22.713
CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL SO I

THIS PROCESS I JUST CURIOUS I

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.687
MADE A MISTAKE IN THE

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.388
OPPOSITION EARLY BUT IS THERE

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.491
AN ANTICIPATED OR GOLD DATE OF

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:38.195
WHEN THIS WILL BE FINISHED. HE

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.297
THE GOAL IS TO HAVE IT

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:45.035
CONCLUDED BY THE FALL OF TWENTY

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:46.036
TWENTY FIVE AND THAT IS KIND OF

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.504
A PRACTICAL RULE THAT'S HOW THE

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.607
WEST WING WAS DONE YOU YOU HAVE

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.675

OUR WORK THE FIRST THREE

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:56.447
QUARTERS OF EVERY YEAR. AND IN

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:59.216
THE- FOURTH QUARTER OF AN EVEN

00:41:59.283 --> 00:41:59.817
NUMBER HERE WE TYPICALLY HAVE

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:02.052
ELECTIONS. SO REALLY FOR THE

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:04.788
WHOLE PROJECT THE ONE TIME THAT

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.657
IS OPPORTUNE TO MOVE LAWMAKERS

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.158
IN MASS IS THE FOURTH QUARTER

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.627
OF AN ODD EVERY YEAR SO THAT'S-

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:13.264
BEEN THE TARGET- WE EXPECT THAT

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.598
STARTING NEXT YEAR WE WOULD

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.100

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.178
MARK. OR WE SUFFER A LOT OF

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:30.314
TURMOIL MOVING PEOPLE MIDSTREAM

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.416
OR WAITED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:33.450

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:37.087
AND EXPENSE. SO THE GOAL IS.

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:39.156
FOURTH QUARTER TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.291
FIVE. AND I WILL SAY THAT A

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:43.327
MAJOR PART OF THE PROJECT HAS

PEOPLE TO ENTER FROM THE WEST

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.892
THAT'S WHEN IT WAS BUILT. AND

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:31.428
THERE IS A PLAN FOR A VISITOR

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.497

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:15.005
GREAT STATE. IT COULD BE

STATE LIKE OURS. ARM SEOUL I

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.429
PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THE

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.331
INTERIORS OF THESE BILLS BECOME

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:43.534
A PALETTE TO DO A LOT OF

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.302
NARRATIVE ABOUT THE STATE AND A

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:48.272
MARKER C. ERA AND I REALLY SEE

CERTAINLY TURNED OUT BY THE

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.053
FALL OF TWENTY FOUR SO OTHERS

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.556

I ACTUALLY SUPPORTERS STRONGLY

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.073
I KIND OF FEEL WE WOULD BE WELL

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.209
SERVED TO DEDICATE THE TWO

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:27.244

HISTORY. AND THEIR

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:39.856
RELATIONSHIP. AND WHILE I FEEL

WHAT I CAN DO IS I'M A STRONG

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:50.400
PLACE TO SAY THIS WOULD BE A

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:53.136
GREAT. WAY TO DEDICATE TO FOUR

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:54.738
FOUR ROOMS TO THIS BUT ACTUALLY

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.139
THE CONTENT I FEEL THAT SOMEONE

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.308
ELSE'S CONVERSATION IS SORTED

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:01.144

THAT IN THE- IN A VISITOR

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:11.555
CENTER. WE WOULD PROBABLY

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:13.223
APPROACH IT ON THE BASIS THAT

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.125
THERE ARE. AREAS THAT ARE

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.564
BE A SPACE THAT WULD BE SORT

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.933

SOME WAY. CENTER THEY RELATE TO

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:51.695
AS PRESIDENT AND A PART OF THE

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.197
BUILDING. THANK YOU BILL YES.

APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.637
THAT YOU AND SENATOR ALSO JUST

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:04.207
HAD- AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HOW

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:05.642
EVERYONE VIEWS THIS BUILDING

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.110
THE NEW BUILDING. AT ITS

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.712
OBJECTIVE I THINK ONE THING

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.980
THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF PLACE

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.915
IS THE VIEW OF THE CAPITOL DOME

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:13.216
FROM THE ATRIUM AND I'M I'M

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.751
GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE. TAKEN

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:15.852
THAT SO EVERYONE WHO'S IN THAT

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:16.953
BUILDING REMEMBERS WHERE THEY

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.755
ARE AND THAT IS A VERY SPECIAL

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.757
PLACE I DO WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.025
THE SECURITY CONCERNS ARE

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:24.194
RAISED IN IN CLOSED SESSION-

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.696
THE ISSUE THAT I WANT TO RAISE

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:28.231
IS ONE THAT I THINK- CENTER

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:29.866
HERTZBERG. USED A VERY

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.301
IMPORTANT ORD JUST RECENTLY HE

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:32.936
TALKED ABOUT FLEXIBILITY ABOUT

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:33.870
THE BUILDING PARTICULARLY ABOUT

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:38.241
THE FUTURE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT-

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:40.610
THE WAY THAT WE LEGISLATE THERE

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.145
ARE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.181
LAWMAKERS FOR STATE OF FORTY

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:46.950
MILLION- UPON ENTRY- THE STATE

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:48.385
HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND AT

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.153
THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.157
ABOUT A MILLION AND WE MAY HAVE

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:55.292
SIXTY EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.794
REPRESENTIN THE FUTURE. THE

00:49:57.861 --> 00:49:59.029
HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS IS

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.630
BAKED INTO OUR OUR CONSTITUTION

00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:02.966
BUT THERE COULD BE A TIME. WHEN

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:03.867
WE DETERMINE THAT THERE'S A

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:05.602
DIFFERENT NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.137
AND OF COURSE FLEXIBILITY IN

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:09.639
TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE HAVE NOT

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:12.075
EMBRACED DURING THE PANDEMIC-

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.677
CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE WOULD

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.578
WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.880
WE DON'T. ENGAGE IN NOT

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:19.983
FLEXIBILITY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.818
BUT THAT. HOW DO WE TAKE INTO

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.353
CONSIDERATION WHAT THAT ANNEX

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.090
WILL BE LIKE FOR A POTENTIAL-

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:29.126
YOU KNOW THE- LEGISLATURE THAT

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.161
MIGHT BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:35.298
TWENTY LAWMAKERS. I THINK

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:41.004
THAT'S A VERY. FORWARD LOOKING

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.040
WHO CANNOT DISMISS IT OUR-

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:47.577
AGAIN THIS I'M ONLY THE DRIVER

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:48.645
DURING THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.680
STARTED- MY PREDECESSOR AND

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:52.215
FIRST OF ALL IT'LL PICK

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.950
MCCONNELL PASSED TO SOMEONE

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.720
ELSE I THINK ON BEHALF OF THE

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.156
LEGISLATURE ARE. I SORT OF

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:02.092
ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL MOVE

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:02.826
FORWARD THE TIME IN THE SWING

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:05.429
SPACE WHILE THIS BUILDING GETS

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:07.798
ADDRESSED WE WILL MOVE BACK I

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.099
WOULD ANTICIPATE THE FOLKS IN

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:12.436
L. O. V. WILL THEN MOVE INTO

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:15.238
THE- SWING SPACE. AND THEN L.

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:17.340
BE WILL GET ADDRESS BECAUSE IT

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:20.510
ALSO HAS ISSUES. THE STATUTE BY

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:23.280
WHICH WE AUTHORIZED TGS TO

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:23.814
PURSUE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.349
SWING SPACE. INCLUDED LANGUAGE

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.718
THAT REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.620
IT WAS ANTICIPATED THERE WOULD

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:33.657
BE A LONG TERM NOT DEFINE JOINT

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.592
OCCUPANCY OF THAT BUILDING BY

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.526
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.595
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. SO WE

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:42.065
ACTUALLY HAVE ALL THE POTENTIAL

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.767
THAT THAT MINE WAS ACTUALLY TO

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:44.868
SUPPORT THE L. B. PROJECT TO BE

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.803
HONEST BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT OPEN

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.072
ENDED SO THERE'S THERE IS SOME

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.041
FLEXIBILITY WE ARE NOW IN THE

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:55.645
PROCESS OF- AS A CAPITAL CAMPUS

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:58.782
PARTY TO HAVE. WELL DESIGNED

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.450
BUILDINGS THAT ARE CLOSER AT

00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:05.455
HAND I. SO I THINK THERE IS

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.857
BASED UPON THE WORK OF FLORIDA

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:10.060
THERE THERE IS POTENTIAL- FOR

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.628
DEALING WITH THOSE SORTS OF

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:17.901
THINGS. I IN MY EXPERIENCE. THE

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.369
ONCE IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:21.805
THERE IS A D. THE LEGISLATURE

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.573
TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR WILL

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.644
FIND A SOLUTION- YOU KNOW ALL

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.646
THAT WOULD REQUIRE AT A MINIMUM

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.815
ALTHOUGH WOULD REQUIRE. IS THAT

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:34.451
THE LEGISLATURE CONCLUDED THAT.

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.352
WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE BILL

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.319
THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:37.921
DOESN'T SIGN IT WILL DO AN

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:41.258
OVERRIDE. AND THAT IS THE ONE

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:43.226
ON CHECK BOX IN THE NEW

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:44.361
GENERATION OF LAWMAKERS AS A

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.396
YOUNG MAN I WORK WITH. A MEMBER

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.265
OF THE DIDN'T OVERRIDE AB FIVE

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.099
MEETING I REMEMBER VERY

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.401
CLEARLY. A POLICY BACK RIGHT SO

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:52.903
WE DO HAVE A TOOL IN OUR TOOL

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:55.005
KIT IS AN INSTITUTION. TO

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.373
REALLY FORCE AN ISSUE IF WE

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.375
FELT WE HAD IN THE- THAT'S WHAT

00:52:58.441 --> 00:52:59.576
I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:02.212
THE POINT I SUPPOSE A POTENTIAL

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.314
WAY TO THE BRAINS FROM IT THIS

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:05.115
IS THAT EXTRA SPACE WOULD

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.950
EITHER BE. WHAT WE CALL THE

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.385
SWING SPACE NOW BUT COULD BE

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:10.987
THE L. O. B. AS AN EXTRA

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.523
BUILDING FOR MORE MEMBERS IF

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.191
THAT. IS THE NEED OF THE

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:19.563
LEGISLATURE OR ADDITIONAL.

00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:20.163
OFFICE SPACE HOWEVER YOU WANT

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.197
TO DESCRIBE THAT. PETER THAT'S

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:26.002
RIGHT LOOK. TWENTY YEARS AGO

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:27.037
THERE WERE THIRTY TWO UNITED

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.805
STATES SENATORS AND A HUNDRED

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.440
EIGHT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.042
THOSE THINGS CHANGE I

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:34.411
COMPLETELY AGREE I THINK THAT.

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:37.847
ON THE ONE HAND WE WORK HARD TO

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.215
CREATE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY-

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:41.551
LIKE THAT WORD THANK YOU. IN

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:44.554
THIS PROCESS BY. DEALING WITH

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:45.789
THE NEAR TERM THING OF CARS AND

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.390
THE LIKE AND- WHAT WE THINK

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:49.292
COULD BE THE CASE BUT THERE'S A

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.261
PROPOSALS PROPOSAL RECENTLY

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.029
INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE TEN

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.864
THOUSAND MEMBERS RECENTLY ON

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.532
THE BALLOT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.734
CAN WORK OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.669
OF THE CONSTITUTION AND MAKE

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.171
THOSE KINDS OF DETERMINATIONS

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:02.973
WILL WORKING REMOTELY TODAY WHO

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.741
KNOWS WHAT THAT WORKS CAN LOOK

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:05.942
LIKE. I THINK WE CAN ONLY GO

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.744
KIND OF AS FAR AS WE CAN.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.546
LOOKING AROUND THOSE CORNERS

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.648
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.683
TECHNOLOGY AND EVERY LEVEL GET

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.552
AS MUCH DIMENSION THERE'S

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:16.519
POSSIBLE GET AS MUCH

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:19.456
FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. AND IF

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.057
IN THE FUTURE. WHAT THAT LOOKS

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:22.292
LIKE A YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.727
MEAN I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN A

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.462
SITUATION WE CREATE THAT LEVEL

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:28.865
OF FLEXIBILITY- SHOVING BUT- I

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:29.733
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FOR THAT

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.534
WOULD GO WITH THAN THAT. IN

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:32.035
TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.770
HYPOTHETICALS BUT I'LL SAY THIS

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:38.208
MUCH. IT IS CERTAINLY- BEEN IN

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:40.543
MY MIND AND EXPLORE THOSE

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:41.478
THOUGHTS BUT IT'S KIND OF THIS

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:42.312
LIMITED BY SOME PRACTICAL

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.080
REALITIES. AND I THINK WE CAN

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:46.216
GO AS FAR AS WE CAN. IS A VERY

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.151
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TODAY.

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:52.555
ADA ACCESS EARTHQUAKE ACCESS-

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.224
AND WHAT'S COLDER. DISPATCH

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.392
THIS IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:56.726
THAT CHALLENGES OUR STAFFING

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.795
HEALTH OF OUR STAFF. CHALLENGES

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.730
MEMBERS. AND I THINK GETTING

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.766
PAST THOSE THINGS. ARE PRETTY

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:06.836
SIGNIFICANT IN THE NEAR TERM SO

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:07.470
I HOPE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT.

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:08.071
THANK YOU. NO ONE OF THE COME

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.107
SYSTEM IT IT'S LIKE. THIS IS

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:13.610
ACTUALLY A VERY FITTING THING

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:14.210
FOR THE MEMBERS OF DRUG RULES

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.246
COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE ARE.

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.947
CUSTODIANS OF THE INSTITUTION.

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:18.982
BECAUSE ACTUAL WHAT THE

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.383
BUILDING WHAT WHAT A

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.419
LEGISLATIVE BUILDING NEEDS. IT

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.087
IS TO BE A FACILITY SITES IN

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.989
SUCH A WAY THAT. YOU CAN HAVE

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.091
MEMBERS. AND OF A MEMBER OF THE

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.225
COMMITTEE CHAIR HAVE THE CAN

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.827
HAVE THEIR COMMITTEE STAFF NEAR

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:34.597
AT HAND. BECAUSE ACTUALLY

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:39.669
CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN WHO HAVE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.404
THEIR STAFF BECOME MORE

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.640
EFFECTIVE IS CHEERS WE ARE

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.641
UNDER TERM LIMITS WE ARE

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:46.643
SUBJECT TO TWELVE YEARS MAXIMUM

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.878
WE APPOINT SOMEONE A CHAIR TO

00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:50.613
SUPPORT A MEMBER BY LETTING

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.382
THEM HAVE READ READY ACCESS TO

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.283
THEIR STAFF NOT ACROSS THE

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.218
STREET BUT RIGHT IN THE

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.953
BUILDING ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.521
QUALITY OF LAWMAKERS SUPPORTS

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.290
THE FITNESS THE STRENGTH OF

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:03.126
THAT CHAIR OVERTIME. SO REALLY

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:06.262
A MAJOR PART OF THIS PROJECT IS

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.531
TO MOVE THE INSTITUTION BACK IN

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.700
A DIRECTION WHERE. CHAIRS AND

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:14.738
STAFF CAN BE COLOCATED AS A WAY

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:15.472
TO KIND OF STRENGTHENED THE

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:18.108
LEGISLATIVE WORK AND YOU SORT

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:19.509
OF PLAY THAT OUT OF YOUR SAID

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.810
OURS IS LIKE IT'S MORE THAN

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:23.279
JUST HOUSING OF MEMBERS IT'S

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:25.248
LIKE A SOCIAL FACILITIES AND TO

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.549
BE HONEST I THINK PEOPLE WHO

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.751
ARE NOT A PART OF A LECTURE

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.753
DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. THE

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:30.720
WAY SOME OF THESE THINGS WORK

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:35.024
TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN LAWMAKER.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.861
SIDE LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.763
WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT- ANY

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:41.231
MEMBERS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.365
SWING SPACE FOR THE ELEVATOR IN

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.701
THE DOG HOUSE. YEAH THAT- THERE

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.336
JUST MIGHT BE A SPACE AND

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:47.871
FLEXIBILITY ISSUE AND THAT

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:49.506
THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING TO

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:51.107
CONTEMPLATE FOR THE FUTURE YEAH

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.609
NO IT'S GOOD I WANT TO QUOTE

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:55.411
MARK TWAIN WHO SAID THE MAN

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:57.313
WITH A NEW IDEA IS A CRANK.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.616
UNTIL IT SUCCEEDS AND I WANT TO

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:00.784
TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE WAS

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:02.452
INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THE L.

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.521
O. B. OUT OF GOVERNOR WILSON

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:06.723
WAY BACK WHEN- WHEN THAT WAS

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.491
FOR LIKE A NEW IDEA. AND NOW

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:09.826
IT'S BECOME INTEGRATED OUR

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:12.195
BRACES SO NO LONGER CRANK A

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.597
CENTERS FOR YEAH FELT LIKE ONE

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.299
OF THE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW JUST

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:17.634
JUST YOU KNOW GO AGAIN IN

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.635
HAVING THIS KIND OF MORE

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:19.969
DETAILED DISCUSSION ONE OF THE

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:22.138
CHALLENGES THERE WAS AS WE AS

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:23.506
AN INSTITUTION CARE DEEPLY

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:24.808
ABOUT PEOPLE AND SET STANDARDS

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.342
IN THE LIKE WE MOVED OUT OF

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:27.677
THIS HOUSE SIXTEEN COMMITTEES

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.045
ACROSS FLORIDA. BECAUSE

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.346
PEOPLE'S WORKING CONDITIONS ARE

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:32.215
SO DIFFICULT AND CREATED NEW

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.818
AND BETTER OFFICES FOR MEMBERS-

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.186
THAT WEREN'T SO CRAMPED AND

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.220
GAVE IT A CAN YOU GIVE

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.589
CONFERENCE ROOMS HAVE A PLACE

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:42.192
TO EAT- AND THE LIKE AND IN A

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:43.893
CHILD CARE CENTER. TO DO THOSE

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.395
KINDS OF THINGS DEALING WITH

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:46.696
THE THOSE ISSUES SO YOU'RE

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:47.864
RIGHT WE BOTTOM FROM PUBLIC

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.265
GOVERNOR WILSON WHATEVER YEAR

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:50.967
THAT WAS I CAN'T REMEMBER

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.068
TOWARD ON THE ONE IN THE BACK

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:56.906
WHICH IS NOW. THE SPACE FOR THE

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:58.608
SWING SPACE. AND WE HAVE ALL.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:00.677
EXCEPT TO YOU'VE GOT THE SET

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.779
HERE REPRESENTS A DISTRICT YEAH.

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:06.082
CENTER THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.784
WHILE CERTAINLY ENOUGH LONG

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.185
ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE NEW

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.987
BUILDING IT WILL BE IT IS IN MY

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:12.188
DISTRICT AND I'LL BE LOOKING AT

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.090
IT AS THE RESIDENTS SACRAMENTO

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.159
FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'M SURE-

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:16.993
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.361
APOLOGIZE I WASN'T ABLE TO BE

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.430
THERE FOR. ANOTHER HEARING

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.599
GOING ON- POLICY HEARING BUT I

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:23.967
DID HAVE A- SO FIRST OF ALL

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.935
THANK YOU- ONE OF THINGS THAT'S

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:26.769
GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT I

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.204
KNOW THAT YOU'VE PAID ATTENTION

TO IS SERVE BOTH PUT THE FLOW

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:32.075
THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO SAFETY. AS

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.544
WELL- KNOWING THAT- BUT I GUESS

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.012
MIKE WHAT THE QUESTIONS I HAVE

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:36.646
AND AGAIN I'M JUST LOOKING AT

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:38.248
PICTURES OF RENDERINGS AND SO

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:39.048
FORTH YOU KNOW IT IS IN

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.885
SACRAMENTO AND- SACRAMENTO GETS

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:45.622
VERY HOT IN THE SUMMER. AS WELL

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:47.056
INCLUDING IN AUGUST WE DO END

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.825
OF SESSION I SEE A LOT OF GLASS

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:50.760
THERE- SO YOU MAY HAVE RATED

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:52.629
DRESS THIS BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:53.963
TOUCH ON A YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.331
TRYING TO GO FOR A BETTER

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.767
CLIMATE FUTURE AND SO FORTH AND

00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:01.170
SO- IN TERMS OF ITS- ENERGY OF

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:03.339
BALANCE AND DID I WAS WONDERING

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:04.941
LIKE DO WE HAVE AND AGAIN I'M

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.043
NOT ARCHITECT SO IT WE- HAD. TO

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.178
HAVE MORE- LIKE HEAT HEAT SINKS

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.413
AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.915
HELP US REDUCE OUR ENERGY USE

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.383
WHILE ALSO KEEPING THE BUILDING

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:15.084
COOL EFFICIENTLY ESPECIALLY

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.120
DURING THE PARTICULARLY HOT DRY

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.821
SUMMERS WE HAVE HERE HOOKED

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.590
RIGHT WHETHER WE HAVE HERE IN

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:22.091
SACRAMENTO SO IT'S MORE

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:26.429
EFFECTIVE. SACRAMENTO'S AT

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.932
KLEINER. AND MAKE IT HARDER.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.033
GOING TO THE TO VERY GOOD

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.067
CENTER WILL ONE OF THE- OF THE

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.035
VERY. GOES WE WILL HAVE AMONG

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:33.536
MOST ENTERED EFFICIENT CAPITALS.

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:36.973
IN THE NATION. AND RATED HIGH

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.775
FROM LEAD STANDPOINT BUT LET ME

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:41.744
TURN TO. MR PLUS HILLS. WOULD

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:46.482
MAKE. THEY'RE VERY OFTEN. MHM

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.418
THANK OF THAT'S AN EXCELLENT

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.585
QUESTION THEN- THERE ARE MANY

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.454
ASPECTS TO THE ENERGY

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:54.524
CONSUMPTION OF THE OPERATIONS

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.591
OF THE BUILDING ONE OF WHICH IS

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:57.727
THE PERFORMANCEOF THE EXTERIOR

00:59:57.794 --> 01:00:00.697
WALL AS YOU MENTIONED THE GLASS

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:04.534
COULD BE AN ISSUE- THE WAY THE

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.468
BUILDING IS A SIGN IS ABOUT.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.404
THEY SAVE YOU VERY CLOSE TO A

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:12.542
6040% RATIO OF- VISION GLASS IN

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.510
WHAT WE CALL THE SPEND OF LESS

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.779
OPAQUE BLACK. SO THAT-

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.448
OBVIOUSLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.416
OF- SOLAR HEAT RADIATION THAT

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:24.554
COMES IN ANOTHER ASPECT OF- OF

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.955
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.991
TODAY IS AT THE HIGH PRICE

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.193
PERFORMANCE OF THE GLASS. THAT

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:33.563
IS THAT IS. EXISTING TODAY IS

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:36.966
A- VERY VERY- HIGH PERFORMANCE

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.634
IN TERMS OF MITIGATING SOLAR

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:41.137
HEAT GAIN. AND AT THE SAME TIME

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.473
ALLOWING DAYLIGHT TO COME IN.

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:46.175
AS YOU KNOW ANOTHER- CONDITION

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:49.445
OF ENERGY OPERATIONAL EXPENSES

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:52.181
ARE THE LIGHTS RIGHT WHEN WE

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:55.251
BRING THEY LIGHT IDEALLY. YOU

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.986
CAN TURN THE LIGHTS OFF AND NOT

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.855
EXPEND THAT ENERGY SO WE WANNA

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.990
HARVEST THAT THEY LIKE AND WE

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:03.026
WANT TO MITIGATE THAT GLARE AT

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.327
WHICH WE DO WHAT WE CALL A

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.895
FRIEND TO PATTERN THAT IS

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.431
APPLIED TO THE- INSIDE SURFACE

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.333
OF THE GLASS. THAT ALSO

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.668
REFLECTS THAT HEAT OUT SO IT IS

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.671
A VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:19.609
EXTERIOR WALL. IN GENERAL ON.

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.944
ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. WE

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.247
HAVE FOR RAISE THE CHALLENGE

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.849
FOR THE OUR PARTNERS WE DO ONE

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:27.450
ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDING FOR

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.886
EXAMPLE. BUT WE FOR A SAID WELL

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.054
WE'RE CERTAINLY HAS IT IN

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.156
CUTTING EDGE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:34.824
CALIPHATE EXHIBIT. WELL

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.726
UNDERSTOOD OUTSTANDING DESIGN

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.795
BUT NOT BLEEDING EDGE NOT SOUL

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.196
SO FAR OUT THERE THAT YOU YOU

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.198
HAVE A TECHNOLOGICAL FAIL. SO

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:44.133
IT'S SORT OF A FORWARD LOOKING

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.404
BUT WITH THE CONSERVATIVE BENT-

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:48.971
BUT ON THE ISSUE OF GLASSES

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.840
VERY. I WOULD SAY WE'RE SEEING

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.075
A LOT MORE USE OF HIGH

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:52.942
PERFORMANCE CLASSES IN

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.378
CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE- THE FACT

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.280
IS PEOPLE LIKE WORK AND WHERE

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.281
THEY SEE SUNLIGHT SO THERE'S

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.749
SORT OF A WORK FORCE

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.951
CONSIDERATION. PROVIDE MORE

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:03.486
NATURAL LIGHTING THAT CAN

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.288
ACCESS THE SWEETS CERVANTES

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.289
COULDN'T CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.157
DIED DON'T OBJECT TO A CLASS IN

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.359
ITSELF- THE MATERIAL HI IT'S

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.095
ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE NO THE

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.763
MASS OF THE BUILDING AND HOW

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.864
CAN REPRESENTS THE HEAT SAYING.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.466
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW LIGHTS THE

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.633
PRESENCE OF PEOPLE GENERATES

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.335
HEAT AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.703
I APPRECIATE THAT AND EVEN I

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.071
UNDERSTAND YOU CAN HAVE NOW PUT

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.840
GLASS PANES AND AGAIN I DON'T

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.308
KNOW HOW HORRIBLE IT IS. THAT

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.076
ACTUALLY A SOLAR PANELS THAT

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.545
ALSO ACT AS WINDOW PANES AS

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.013
WELL SO THE DEGREE WE CAN EVEN

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.982
GENERATE ENERGY- WITH THE

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.951
APPROPRIATE TYPE OF. PANELS

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.185
AGAIN WHETHER IT'S A COST

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.020
EFFICIENT OR NOT I DON'T KNOW

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:38.955
BUT- I THINK IT'S AN

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.424
OPPORTUNITY AS WELL- BUT THOSE

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.059
ARE GOING TO. SEND RAZA IS

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.094
COMMON ALSO WAS WE WANT THIS

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.796
GOING TO BE WARM AND INVITING

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.797
WHY IS IT WARM NOT JUST KEEP

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.165
HIGHS BUT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.267
PEOPLE WALKING N. THIS NOT SO

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.136
TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT ON THE BIG

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.071
PHONE IT DOES PROPONENT OF-

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.973
HIGH TECHNOLOGY- BUT ALSO WE

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.374
WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL WELCOME

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.276
WHEN THEY WALK IN AND SO AN

EXACTLY WHAT THE TONES AND SO

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.949
FORTH NAY MAY CREATE THAT SENSE

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.918
OF IS IT JUST A BIG INSTITUTION

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.052
THAT HOW MOST PEOPLE VIEW THE

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.387

WANT A WELCOMING BUILDING. AND

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:26.903

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:27.537
THE TALK ABOUT THAT EAST ENTRY.

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.872
AT THE- IT JUSTIFIES. IF YOU'RE

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:30.673
ON THE OUTSIDE. YOU DO SEE THE

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.308

LARGE ASSEMBLY AREA UNDER A

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.312
SKYLIGHT. AND I ACTUALLY THINK

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:37.313
IF YOU EVER BEEN IN A PLACE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.415
WHERE YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE

LEAST FIFTY FIVE TREES LARGE

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.374
AND SMALL REMOVED- THREATENED

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.676
DUE TO THE DOUBLETREE ANNEX

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:35.044
BUILDING AND THE TWELFTH ST

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.246
UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE SOME

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.914
OF THEM MIGHT IT MAY INCLUDE A

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:41.183
GIGANTIC SIKORA TWO HISTORIC

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.052
HOMES THE LAST REMAINING OLD

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.820
MAGNOLIA MAGNOLIA AND A

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:47.223
COCKSPUR CORAL TREE. THAT WILL

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.324
BE REMOVED IF THE TWELFTH

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.159
STREET PARKING GARAGE IS BUILT

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.760
THAT CORAL TREES THE LARGEST IN

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.429
CALIFORNIA AND IS LISTED AS AN

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.397
INTERNATIONAL MONUMENTAL TREE

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.132
OVER SEVENTEEN FEET AROUND AT

01:08:57.199 --> 01:09:00.135
THE AT THE TRUNK NOW IF IT IT

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.171
MAY BE PROPOSED FOR BEING MOVED

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.672
BUT MOVING IS NOT THE SAME

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.174
THING IS SAVING WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.243
TREE OF THAT SIZE IT'S VERY

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.511
DIFFICULT TO MOVE THOSE TREES

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.212
AND SO YOU MAY OPTIMISTICALLY

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.981
SAY THEY ARE SLATED FOR TO BE

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:16.185
pMOVED BUT THEY MADE THAT AND-

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:16.819
THEN PARRIS WITHIN YEARS. SO WE

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.454
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. ANYTHING

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.389
THAT MOVES BEYOND THE EXISTING

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.358
FOOTPRINT. OF THE STATE OF THE

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.460
CAP THE HISTORIC CAPITOL ANNEX

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.629
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. THIS

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:29.598
COMPLEX IS SURROUNDED BY TREES

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.467
AND SO ANYTIME YOU GO OUTSIDE

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.568
THE FOOTPRINT YOU'RE

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.737
ENDANGERING TREES. AND WE

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.273
BELIEVE THAT. WE ARE GLAD TO

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.241
SEE THAT THE VISITOR CENTERS IS

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:41.644
NOT IN THE SLIDES. BECAUSE THAT

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.612
WOULD ALSO BRING ABOUT A

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.781
DESTRUCTION OF TREES AS WELL

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.650
AS- OF THE WEST PLAZA MEETING

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.986
PLACE. AND SO WE THINK THAT. WE

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.254
ARE ASKING THE JOINT RULES

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:54.690

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.738
YOUR CONSULTANTS SO IT'S BEEN

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:18.007
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:22.244
THIS PROJECT IS AN IMPACT TODAY.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.480
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:25.114
THE VISITOR CENTER AS FAR AS WE

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.817
KNOW. AND YET IT'S IN THE ER

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:31.854
AND WILL BE APPROVED WHEN THE

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.857
ER INSIDE. SO IT'S VERY

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.526
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:40.963
TOTAL PROJECT. FINALLY UNLIKE

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.566
OTHER STATE PROJECTS WHICH I'VE

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.935
WORKED ON IN MY PAST. THIS

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.570
PROJECT HAS HAD NO FISCAL

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:52.107
OVERSIGHT. NO REVIEW BY

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.143
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LMAO AND

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:56.345
THE CLASS OF THIS BUILDING

01:11:56.412 --> 01:12:00.549
SINCE WE ESTIMATE IS ONE

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:01.150
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:04.553
PER SQUARE FOOT. COMPARED TO

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.188
OTHER STATE BUILDINGS THAT HAD

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.090
REVIEW SUCH AS YOUR SWING

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:11.860
BUILDING. WHICH IS NINE HUNDRED

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:12.528
EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER SQUARE

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:16.298
FOOT WHICH WAS MORE REASONABLE.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.767
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.236
ARE GROWING AND HAVE DOUBLED IN

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.238
TWO YEARS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:25.140

I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS- WHEN I

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:24.840
PROPOSALS THAT WOULD COME TO ME

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.174
THAT BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.909
DOLLARS THERE OR GREATER. I

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.644

KAPPA ANNEX PROJECT THAT'S

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.057
BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW THAT

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.291
WERE FAILING ON BOTH THOSE

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:46.228
COUNTS. OF NOW IS REALLY A

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.230
PIVOTAL TIME TO FOCUS ON OUR

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.032
ECONOMY AND THE RECOVERY OF OUR

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:52.434
ECONOMY- WE'RE PLEASED THAT

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.403
THERE IS A- STATE BUDGET

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:56.872
SURPLUS THAT MAY ALLOW US TO-

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.874
HELP- TEND TO THE NEEDS OF

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.443
CITIZENS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.912
THE RECOVERY PROCESS IS GOING

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.714
TO BE A VERY LONG LONG ROAD.

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.750
AND THIS IS A PROJECT. AND THE

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:09.985
RESTORATION OF THE ANNEX IS

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.220
IMPORTANT BUT THERE ARE LIKELY

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:15.791
VERY. A NUMBER OF PLAUSIBLE

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:16.691
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE LESS

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.760
COSTLY AND WHAT IS BEING

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:21.963
PROPOSED AT THIS TIME-

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.465
TAXPAYERS HAVE HAD TO TIGHTEN

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.433
THEIR BELTS DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:27.035
STORM. AND LIKE WISE WE NEED TO

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.670
BE VERY THOUGHTFUL IN HOW WE

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.839
APPROACH THIS AND OTHER OTHER

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:33.075
SPENDING PROJECTS- WE HAVE THAT

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:37.112
RESPONSIBILITY. AND THIS IS

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.580
GOING TO BE A PROPOSAL THAT IS

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:39.881
GOING TO BE A BURDEN

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.616
FINANCIALLY UPON THIS STATE FOR

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:45.520
DECADES TO COME- SO IN TWO

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.021
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'RE

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.956
ESTIMATING THE COST OF FIVE

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.224
HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION. BY

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.759
A TWENTY TWENTY THAT COST

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:53.228
ESTIMATE IS OVER ONE BILLION

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.530
AND GROWING AND I THINK YOU CAN

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.466
ALL AGREE THAT ONE BILLION

01:18:57.532 --> 01:19:00.802
DOLLARS CAN GO A LONG WAY TO

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:01.403
ASSISTING THE CITIZENS OF OUR

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.138

PROJECT AT THIS POINT IN TIME

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.192
IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.961
