00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.003
THEY DO FOR YOU KNOW THE AND

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.904
MINORITIES THAT ARE THERE SO

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.372
IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:02.708
TO BE ADDRESSED WITH ALL THE

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:05.911
EIGHTY YOU -- LEGISLATION ON MY

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.780
TWO CONCERNS ARE CERTAINLY THAT

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.415

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:10.916
PRETTY WELL KNOWN. FOR MY

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.718
CONCERN ABOUT PARKING ISSUES SO

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.453
I AM LAYING OFF ALL THESE BILLS

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.688
TO SEE WHICH ONE FINALLY ALL

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.590
COMES TOGETHER BUT I DON'T THINK

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:18.924
WE CAN DENY.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.159
WHAT IS BEEN TRADITIONAL IN

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.161
TERMS OF ZONING THAT HAS MORE TO

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.897

FEATURES ON THOSE ARE THINGS

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:33.472
THAT CERTAINLY.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.107
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE SPENT

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:36.609
MAYBE TOO MUCH TIME ON DESIGN

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.310
REVIEW BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.579
PUBLIC SAFETY REVIEW AND YOU

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.052

AS WE LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.658
THIS WHICH I THINK IS A POSITIVE

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.627
I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE TO USE OR

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:56.295

BUT I CAN CALL IN LAGUNA BEACH

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.031
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE INCORPORATED

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.166

IT REMOVES PROVISIONS THAT HAVE

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.020

TERM UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.909

IMPORTANT AS IMPORTANT POLICY

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.113

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.682

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.084
ARE.

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.653
MOST IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS THIS

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:48.854
BILL ELIMINATES THE OWNER

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.556
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS OR OR THE

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:52.057
ALLOWANCE FOR FOR LOCAL

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.227
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT -- WE'VE

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.228
HEARD FROM HOMEOWNERS AROUND THE

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:58.463
STATE THAT THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.232
REQUIREMENT CAN BE A BIG BARRIER

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.200
TO OBTAINING FINANCING AND IT'S

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.235
JUST ANOTHER HURDLE FOR THEM TO

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:03.936
CEAR.

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.237
UP BANKS ARE RELUCTANT WE'VE

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.406

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.273
GOING TO BE A DEED RESTRICTION

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.475

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:16.481
FIRST IT CLARIFIES THAT WHEN A

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:17.949
LANDLORD WITHDRAWS A BUILDING

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.618

AT THE TIME OF WITHDRAWAL AND

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.772
MAKES CLEAR THAT THE PAYMENT OF

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.540
A PENALTY DOES NOT EXTINGUISH

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:44.709
THE LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO

VOLUNTARY ACTION BY THE LANDLORD

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:05.363
DOES NOT EXTEND THE TIME LINE

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.731
UNDER THE ACT.

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:08.066

WE'RE WORKING OUT THOSE

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.172
DIFFERENCES WITH CALIFORNIA

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:47.138
IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- I

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:48.440
THINK IT IS REMARKABLE THAT

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.774
AUTHORS AND A GREAT JOB OF

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.576
EXPLAINING WHAT THE BILL DOES --

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:52.944
BUT I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE THAT

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:55.880
WE HAVE AN ALICE ACT BILL THAT --

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.582
IT IN WHICH EVERYONE.

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:01.219
THE TENANT ADVOCATES AND THE THE

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.754
LANDLORDS ARE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:03.989
THE CONCEPTS WERE WORKING OUT

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.090
JUST A FEW.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.125
CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:08.460
AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL WE WILL

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:12.764

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:13.932
PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF

THE LAW AND REDUCE LITIGATION

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.002
OVER SOME AMBIGUITIES EXISTED IN

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:17.836
THE LAW.

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.571
SO WE THINK -- THIS COMPROMISE

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:22.407
MEASURES VERY IMPORTANT ALL THE

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.975

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:18.816
BROKEN ADAM.

THAT'S CORRECT THE OF THE

GOING TO ENSURE THE BONDS -- THE

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:48.412
THOUGHT SO THERE ARE A COUPLE

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:49.981
DIFFERENT -- FINANCING

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.716
MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT BRING --

CORPORATION WOULD BE DEVELOPED.

00:36:01.592 --> 00:36:03.327
SO THEN THE BOND HOLDERS WHICH

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:05.897
IS RELY ON THE NONPROFIT AND IF.

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.498

THE WAY GOES THAT'S YOUR RISK.

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:11.502
YES THAT'S THAT IS CORRECT IT

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.471
WOULD INSULATE THE CITY FROM ANY

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.639
LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.908
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:20.478
THANK YOU MISTER ANNA CABALLERO.

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:23.180
SO FIRST -- LET ME SAY THAT I

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.782
RIGHT THIS IS -- AN INNOVATIVE

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.518
CONCEPT I LIKE IT -- SEC A GREAT

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.121
IDEA BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S THE

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:30.655
SKINNY AS BILL [inaudible]

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.823
WITH.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:38.429
I MEAN IT'S TWO PAGES RIGHT --

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:39.564
IT DOESN'T TELL US MUCH IN SO I

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.598
WAS STRUGGLING WITH THEM WITH

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.133
SOME OF THE DETAILS IN

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.801
PARTICULAR -- SINCE I THINK THIS

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:45.636
IS GOING TO BE THE MODEL FOR

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.238
OTHER CITIES THAT CAN FIND

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:48.606
THEMSELVES IN THE SAME UP WITH

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.174
THE SAME OPPORTUNITY A BIG CITY

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.475
WITH.

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:55.146
A LOT OF RESOURCES IS -- YEAH I

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:57.648
WAS CONCERNED THAT IN AB ONE OF

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.183
THE ISSUES I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.086
IS -- IF IT'S A CITY SPONSORED

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.555
IN THE IT LA IS IN THE NAME --

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.791
AT THE CREDIT -- CONFUSION THAT

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:07.959
MAY OCCUR YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.660
WITH BOND HOLDERS SO YOU'RE

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.262
GOING TO BE OUT IN THE MARKET --

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:12.763
AND THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.633
AGENCIES HADN'T THE NAME OF THE

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.202
CITIES AS WELL AND AND AS YOU

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.236
KNOW THE CITY.

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:20.304
THE CITY STOOD BEHIND THE

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.106
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:25.710
AND REQUIREMENTS AND SO -- AT I

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:27.044
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I ACT

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.913
CONCERNED AS WELL AS IN TERMS OF

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.450
HOW THE BONDS GET REPAID AND I

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:33.618
GUESS IT'S OUT OF THE MORTGAGE.

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.785
THE THE MORTGAGE LENDING THAT'S

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:37.955
OCCURRED -- ALSO ABOUT BOND

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.691
LIMITS -- CAN IT BE.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:42.994
YOU KNOW HOW HOW MUCH BINDING IS

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.961
APPROPRIATE.%

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:48.799
AND AND THEN ALL I'M IN ADDITION

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.034
CONCERNS ABOUT NEPOTISM.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.769
AND I'M ASSUMING THAT SOME OF

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:53.738
THIS HOUSING WILL BE MULTI STORY

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:56.040
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HARD TO

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.475
BUILD IN A BUILT UP CITY UNLESS

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:58.609
YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.111
WHICH THEN MEANS YOU'RE DOING

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:01.679
MAKES USE.

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:04.482
AND IF YOU'RE DOING MAKES USE --

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:06.617
THEN -- THE THE CONCERN I HAD

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:08.919
WAS THIS ONLY PERTAINS TO

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:10.588
HOUSING IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.690
ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR OR

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.191
PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO AT SOME

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.626
POINT YOU MAY HAVE TO DO

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.962
SOMETHING WITH PRIVATE INVESTORS --

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:20.564
AND THEN -- AT THAT THE FINAL

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.133
NOTE THAT I HAD IT AND I WAS

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:23.834
JUST TRYING.

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:24.735
TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX BECAUSE

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.370
LIKE I SAID THERE WASN'T MUCH IN

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:29.340
THE BILL -- THERE WEREN'T ANY

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.075
GUIDE RAILS I GUESS PUT IT THAT

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.276
WAY -- THAT THAT SAY HERE'S

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:33.711
HERE'S OUR MISSION HERE'S OUR

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.312
GOAL HERE'S WHAT WE WE'RE WE'RE

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.681
TRYING TO DRIVE TOWARDS.

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:40.885
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT.

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.219
THAT CITIES TO BIG CITIES IN

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.622
CALIFORNIA HAVE SEEN OF A

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:48.159
SIGNIFICANT INFLUX OF DOLLARS

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.860
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:50.661
I THINK WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:53.364
THAT -- THERE THERE ISN'T AND

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:55.299
AND THE NEPOTISM HAD TO DO WITH.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.536
WITH -- THE THAT THAT MORTGAGE

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:00.538
THE MORTGAGEE MORTGAGE HOLDERS

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:02.873
ARE THE THE PERSON THAT PERSON'S

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.408
IT WOULD GET MORTGAGE --

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:06.377
MORTGAGES -- BEING FAMILY

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.046
MEMBERS OR POLITICAL FRIENDS.

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:10.548
AND AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:11.816
QUITE FRANKLY THE AFFORDABLE

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.117
HOUSING THAT GETS BUILT ALONG

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.152
THE COAST IN THE VERY EXPENSIVE

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.220
AREAS.

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:18.089
TENDS TO GO TO THE CHILDREN WHO

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.490
GREW UP THERE IN THAT COMMUNITY

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.125
WHO CUT WHO COME BACK GO GET AN

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.626
EDUCATION COME BACK.

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.361
AND THEY'RE EARNING THEIR FIRST

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:26.063
WAGES AND DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:26.864
AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.100
QUALIFIED AS OPPOSED TO THE BLUE

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.602
COLLAR WORKING CLASS -- MEMBERS

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.637
OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:34.972
THERE FOR YEARS AND SO.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.808
I'M INTERESTED IN THIS REALLY.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.076
DRILLING DOWN INTO THOSE

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:40.945
INDIVIDUALS THAT HELP KEEP THE

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:43.114
ECONOMY MOVING NOT THE SONS AND

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.115
CHILDREN OF THE ELECTED

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.750
OFFICIALS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.618
THE THE REASON I WOULD I WAS

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.620
LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS OF OF

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:50.788
YOU KNOW THIS IS A GREAT

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:52.590
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME REAL

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:53.424
MAJOR INVESTMENTS.

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:54.558
AND TO BRING AFFORDABLE REAL

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.860
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT BUT I

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:58.262
THINK THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:01.599
BE SOME -- SOME COMMITMENT TO

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:03.667
SET SOME OF THIS IS THAT I DON'T

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:04.535
SEE IN THE BILL SO I AM GONNA

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.737
SUPPORTED TODAY BUT I JUST WANT

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:08.939
TO THROW THAT OUT THERE --

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.775
BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'LL BE I

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:11.976
THINK IT CAN BE A MODEL FOR

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.244
OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT I ALSO

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.645
DON'T WANT TO SEE A SCANDAL

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:15.980
HAPPENED THAT REALLY MAKES AN

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.082
EMBARRASSING SO.

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.683
I GUESS IT'S NOT A QUESTION BUT

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.719
I IF YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEAS IN

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.820
TERMS OF HOW.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.622
IT AND MAYBE THE ENABLING

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.924
DOCUMENTS OF THAT OF THE OF THE

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:29.193
NONPROFIT DEAL WITH SOME OF THIS

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.030
KIND OF OF CONCERN BUT IT'S NOT

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.265
IT'S NOT IN THE BALLOT SITE.

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.699
THE COULD BE HELPFUL IF --

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.134
MISTER SPEAKER MISTER WINTER --

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:38.569
YEAH I I THINK TO SOME RESPONSE

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.172
SURE THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.540
YOUR COMMENTS AND AND CONCERNS

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.041
THERE I THINK THEY ARE VALID

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.076
ONES TO HAVE WHEN DEALING WITH

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.044
INNOCENCE WHAT IS THE PUBLIC

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.046
RUST IN TERMS OF AN ENTITY THAT

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.881
WOULD BE -- SUPPORTING THE

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.249
COMMUNITIES GOALS AROUND OF

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.417
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAKING

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.552
SURE THOSE ARE GOVERNED IN A

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.353
VERY -- PROPER WAY IN A VERY

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.823
OPEN PUBLIC WAY SO WHAT I WOULD

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:00.758
SAY IN GENERAL IS THAT -- WHILE

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.026
THIS WOULD BE A NEW ENTITY TO

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.360
CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SIMILAR

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.995
ENTITIES -- SCATTERED THROUGHOUT

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:07.264
THE COUNTRY -- NEW YORK CITY AS

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.799
AS SORT OF SEEN AS THE BLUE

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:09.667
RIBBON MODEL OF THIS WITH THAT

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.813
UP AS THOUGH IT THOUGH IT IS

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.415
TECHNICALLY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:26.884
THE CITY -- IT HAS -- GOVERNANCE

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.452
RULES AROUND IT ACTING AS A

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.254

ITS -- PUBLIC MEETING SO THROUGH

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:40.865
AFFORDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WE

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.833
WOULD BE EMULATING MANY OF THOSE

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.135
THINGS EXACTLY TO TO THE LETTER --

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.503
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ENTITY

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.504
BECAUSE IT WILL BE A PUBLIC

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.773
BENEFIT CORPORATION SPEAKING ON

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.141
BEHALF OF THE CITY WHAT WE SO

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.776
WHILE HAS NOT BEEN FORMED YET

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.511
WHAT WE ARE FULLY EXPECTING?

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.413
THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR WOULD

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.781
WANT TO SEE IN THIS IS THAT IT

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.250
WOULD HAVE A VERY OPEN AND

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.251
PUBLIC A GOVERNANCE.

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.685
VEHICLE MAKE SURE THAT IT

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.821

HOUSING RULES AS WELL.

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.224
SO I THINK MANY OF THOSE ISSUES

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.026
WOULD BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:09.560
THE ORDINANCE THAT WOULD

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:15.032
EVENTUALLY CREATE THE THE

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.234
CORPORATION ITSELF.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:17.902
THOUGH JUST TO JUST TO FOLLOW UP

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:18.702
ON THAT YEAR CONCEPT IS JUST

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:19.336
GIVE US THE AUTHORITY AND THEN

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.371

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.472
WE'LL PUT IT IN AN ORDINANCE.

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.406
AT THE AT THE CITY LEVEL YES THE

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.674
KEY THING IS THAT -- CITIES

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.409
ACTUALLY DO CURRENTLY HAVE THE

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.644
ABILITY TO CREATE NONPROFIT

PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS AND

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:29.880
SO THERE'S ONE FOR THE AIRPORTS

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:32.116
AS AN EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF LA --

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.617
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.119
FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSING

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.554
THOUGH SO WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:40.257
PROPOSES IS TO HAVE THE THE

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.425

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:43.727
ALREADY CREATE.

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.796
BUT HAVE THEM BE EXEMPT FROM

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.025
ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:23.325
[inaudible]

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:36.038
OKAY OPPOSITION.

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:38.340
GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.074
HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:41.076
COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:41.977
HERMAN.

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.779
ON THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:44.780
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:48.350
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.084
WE'VE SUBMITTED WRITTEN.

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.819
OPPOSITION.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.923
IN IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE --

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:56.292
WE OPPOSE THIS BILL.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:59.595
THE BILL HAD DOES NOT REALLY DO

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:01.764
WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:05.601
THE NEW AMENDMENTS. TO FOUR

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.469
THIRTY HEAD DO LITTLE OR NOTHING

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:08.971
WITH RESPECT TO EXPEDITING

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.406
CONSTRUCTION.

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.107
OF HOUSING FOR DISPLACED PER DAY

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:13.375
SURVIVORS.

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:14.877
IT IS INTENDED TO EXPLOIT THE

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.612
EMOTIONAL CAMPFIRE DISASTER TO

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:19.014
FAST TRACK URBAN SPRAWL

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.516
DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.051
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:23.586
I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE AS

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.321
SOMEONE WHO IS LITIGATING ON THE

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.722
PGA ANY CASES.

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.891
THAT I TALK WITH THE SURVIVORS

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.860
OF PARADISE ATTEND.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.362
AND THE NUMBERS THAT ARE

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:36.165
PRESENTED TO YOU ARE MISLEADING.

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.867
BECAUSE THERE WILL ALREADY NOT

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.970
BE ANYWHERE NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.838
PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.941
AS FAR AS THE NEED FOR HOUSING.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.309
WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:49.244
ISSUES OF THE BILL.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.213
THE FACTS IN THE BILL ITSELF

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.748
REALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT IT

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.883
DOESN'T ADDRESS WHAT IT SAYS

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.185
IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS.

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:59.455
FIRST OF ALL THE DENSITY THAT IS

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.223
THE MINIMUM DENSITY.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.860
OR IS FOUR UNITS PER ACRE.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.462
ANOTHER PROVISION IS IT'S ONLY

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.564
TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA IS FOR

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.965
RESIDENTIAL SOME OF IT CAN BE

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.500
MIXED USE.

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.502
SO IT'S NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.337
RESIDENTIAL IT'S AFFORDABLE.

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.106
AND THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:20.709
YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS BY MISUSE.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.745
TEED UP THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.813
INHERENT IN THE BILL IT REALLY

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.981
DOESN'T ADDRESS.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:28.050
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT DOESN'T

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.252
ENSURE THAT PARADISE SURVIVORS

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:31.086
WILL BE.

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:34.456
BUYERS OR RENTERS OF THE HOUSING.

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.992
AND WHAT IT REALLY DOES WITH A

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.093
FIFTY ACRE MAXIMUM THAT'S

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.362
ALLOWED.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.364
AT THE RATE OF FOUR UNITS PER

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.266
ACRE.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:45.601
IF FOR THE MINIMUM DENSITY IN

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.136
ORDER TO DO IT IT'S NOT REALLY

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:48.337
DENSE HOUSING.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.639
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS A THE

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:52.474
DWELLING UNIT PER ACRE.

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.076
AVERAGE IT SHOOTS FOR WE'RE

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.878
TALKING ABOUT EFFECTIVELY FAST

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.746
TRACKING URBAN SPRAWL

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.715
DEVELOPMENT IN THE CELL

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.250
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.951
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ALREADY THE

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:04.520
LARGE SCALE DEVELOPERS NOW

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.854
COMING UP TO THE SACRAMENTO

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.691
VALLEY TO START DEVELOPING?

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:11.093
OUR OBJECTION IS THAT THE SEQUEL

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.896
EXEMPTION IS NOT THE NECESSARY.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.398
IT'S ALREADY EXISTENCE SEEK WHAT.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.801
AND FURTHER MORE WHAT IT DOES IS

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.003
IT RADICALLY CHANGES THE RATE OF

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.805
GROWTH THAT WILL BE EXPERIENCED

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.506
IN THE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.340
DESIGNATED.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.810
FINALLY TO CLOSE I DID A DRIVE

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.511
THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT.

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.213
OF THE ASSEMBLY MAN THE AUTHORS

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.681
DISTRICT.

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.249
THESE ARE SMALL TOWNS.

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:35.284
THEY DON'T NEED A SEQUEL

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.218
EXCEPTION TO START MOVING

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.187
FORWARD.

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:40.122
SHE BECAUSE BEEN WITHDRAWN SHE

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.690
BECAUSE THE ONE THAT IS A ONE IS

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:42.758
CAN BE DEALING WITH IT WHAT WE

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.526
REALLY NEED IS FUNDING FOR

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.361
PLANNING AND SUPPORT. FOR MORE

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.464
DENSE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY OF

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.431
CHICO.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.433
BY THE WAY OUR ORGANIZATION AND

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.768
OTHERS THAT I REPRESENTED

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.703
SUPPORTED EIGHTY USE IN CHICO WE

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.705
HAVE ADOPTED THAT MEASURE IN THE

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.373
CITY CHICO SO WE BELIEVE AND

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.508
DENSITY.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.642
OF DEVELOPMENT WE BELIEVE IN

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.710
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:02.878
SUPPORT THAT.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:05.180
THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES NOT BRING

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.548
THAT TO THE VALLEY.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.584
IT IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:11.153
REPLICATE THE SAME MISTAKES THAT

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.054
HAVE BEEN MADE AND URBAN

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.355
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.557
AND THE BAY AREA WHERE I GREW UP

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.292
AND I REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.393
HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.895
THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS IT WILL

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.497
BE IGNORED BECAUSE OF THE SEEK

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.365
TO EXEMPTION ARE THE ONES THAT

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.367
ARE GOING TO LEAD THE WAY TO

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.568
MORE SPRAWL.

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.070
THAT WILL LEAD THE WAY TO

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.705
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.173
SMALLER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.008
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPAND

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.042
SO RAPIDLY.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.377
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE SAME KIND

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.146
OF TRANSPORTATION AIR QUALITY

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.580

ISSUE OF OF WHERE THE MONEY GOES.

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:03.297
SO AS FAR AS A GOVERNANCE ISSUE --

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:06.433
WE HAVE -- WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.868
SUGGESTED THAT A COMMITTEE OF

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:10.137

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:13.474
THINK IS APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.142
STRUCTURE. TO THEN BE PROPOSED

TO MISTER REQUIRES COMMITTEE AND

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.178
THAT'S THE HOPE OF WORKING THIS

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.814
OUT IN THE CHALLENGES SO WE

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:24.084
EXPLAINED -- THE MTC AS WE KNOW --

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:26.253
IS VIEWED AS BEING A BIT MORE

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.888
REPRESENTATIVE OF LARGER CITIES

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.390
A BAG IS BEING VIEWED AS A BIT

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:30.391
MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF SMALLER

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:31.925
SUBURBAN CITIES IT'S SORT OF

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:33.994
LIKE ASKING THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:35.529
IN CONGRESS TO KIND OF FIGURE

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:37.064
OUT HOW TO BEST FIGURE THIS OUT

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:39.199
THAT'S A WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:40.401
WHEN THEY COME OUT BACK WE WILL.

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:42.436
VERY LIKELY ASKED TO ADOPT THAT

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:43.737
A MISTER REQUIRES COMMITTEE AS

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.740
FAR AS WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:48.275
TO OF THIS IS ALSO BEEN -- AN

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.310
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH DIFFERENT

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:52.513
JURISDICTIONS -- THERE ARE A LOT

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.981
OF JURISDICTIONS THAT WOULD LIKE

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:56.083
AS MUCH MONEY TO RETURN TO

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:58.352
SOURCE AS POSSIBLE -- AND THAT

01:40:58.419 --> 01:40:59.720
WOULD PREFER TO SEE YOU KNOW

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:02.122
MORE THAN 75% OF THE MONEY GOING

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:03.390
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL COUNTIES

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:04.158
WHERE THE MONEY'S REGENERATOR

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:04.858
FROM.

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:05.993
ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK IT'S

FOR THE SUPERVISORS AND THIRTY

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:19.059
FOUR CITIES ARE ABOUT.

THERE'S ALSO THE SOUTHERN

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.995
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:23.997

HOW WOULD YOUR PROPOSAL COMPARED

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.635
TO THOSE TWO IF YOU IF YOU'RE

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:29.736
FAMILIAR WITH THEM?

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:31.305
SO I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:32.472
SPECIFICS OF YOUR ORANGE COUNTY

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.274
ENTITIES BUT WHEN I REFER TO

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:36.043
SOME OF THE BAY AREA ACRONYMS OF

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:37.678
A BAG AN MTC.

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:39.446
THOSE ARE TWO REGIONAL BODIES --

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.648
THAT REPRESENT CITIES BUT IN

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:43.517
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS -- AND

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.152
THE MTC IS KNOWN AS BEING A

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.453
LITTLE BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.722
OF LARGER MORE URBAN CITIES IN A

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:50.557
BAG IS A BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:52.092
OF SMALLER SUBURBAN CITIES.

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:54.394
WHAT I WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

01:43:54.461 --> 01:43:56.496
BASS THOSE TWO ENTITIES TO WORK

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.198
TOGETHER ON A JOINT COMMITTEE TO

01:43:58.265 --> 01:43:59.600
PROPOSE FINAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.534
BILL?

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.269
SO WHAT I REFER TO AS THAT

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:04.438
PROCESS -- IT SHOULD COME TO A

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:05.973
CLOSE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IN

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.808
TIME TO PUT AMENDMENTS INTO --

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:09.643
CENTER MAGUIRE'S COMMITTEE FOR

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:10.644
FOR CONSIDERATION BUT THE IDEA

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:14.081
IS TO REALLY MERGE ALL OF THOSE --

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:15.782
THOSE INTERESTS TOGETHER -- THE

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:16.950
OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY AND I

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:18.552
AND THIS PARTIALLY RESPONSE TO

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:20.187
CENTER COPIERS POINT WE'RE NOT

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:21.855
TRYING TO ESTABLISH AN ENTIRELY

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:24.257
NEW ENTITY IF WE CAN AT ALL --

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.993
ACHIEVE THAT -- RIGHT NOW A BAG

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:26.994
AND TO SEE OR ENGAGE IN

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.695
CONVERSATIONS POTENTIALLY TO

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:30.197
MERGE SOME OF THEIR FUNCTIONS TO

01:44:30.263 --> 01:44:31.598
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE HOUSING

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:33.000
ISSUES BUT THE REALITY IS WE DO

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.468
NOT HAVE AN ENTITY.

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.269
IN THE BAY AREA THAT IS FOCUSED

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:37.104
ON HOUSING AND THE WAY THAT WE

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.872
NEED TO WE DON'T HAVE AN ENTITY

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.773
IN THE BAY AREA.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.341
THAT CAN ALLOW US TO REALLY

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.243
PROVIDE THE SELF HELP ME THAT WE

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.678
NEED TO DO.

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:45.946
IN THE WAY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.180
IN THE BAY AREA WHEN IT COMES TO

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:48.415
TRANSPORTATION AND SAN FRANCISCO

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:49.950
BAY RESTORATION AND THAT'S WHAT

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:52.352
WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH THIS BILL.

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.488
AND I WAS MT A AND EIGHT MTC

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.189
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.191
COMMISSION AND AB A BAG IS A

01:44:58.258 --> 01:45:00.060
CESSATION OF BAY AREA

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:01.762
GOVERNMENTS.

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:02.729
BECAUSE HE CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH --

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:06.233
ACRONYMS YEAH NO I'M I'M GONNA

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:06.900
DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT.

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:07.634
DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY WERE FORM

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:08.602
WHERE THEY DONE THROUGH

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:10.737
LEGISLATION OR WERE THEY JUST

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.507
TODAY THEY DOES THAT.

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:15.208
MEAN -- SERVE OUR AND SO -- SO

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:18.645
THE MTC -- IS THE MPO

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:19.613
METROPOLITAN PLANNING

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.314
ORGANIZATION FOR THE BAY AREA --

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:23.083
WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.452
ON TRANSPORTATION A BA IS THE

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:26.987
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS OKAY I

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:36.863
THINK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.732
THEY TEND TO BE COMBINED.

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.333
INTO ONE ENTITY AND THE AND THE

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.568
BAY AREA -- THEY'VE NOT BEEN

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:42.302
WHICH HAS CAUSED SOME.

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:43.270
CHALLENGES AND REDUNDANCY AND SO

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.504
THAT'S WHY THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:47.441
ARE -- DISPENSED.

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:51.611
A SEMI MERGER OF STAFF -- AND SO --

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.246
WE STILL AS WE OFTEN DO WE DO A

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:54.748
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN THE IN

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:55.382
THE BAY AREA -- AND I APOLOGIZE

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:57.684
RESTRICT TRYING TO GET THE

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:58.218
CONTEXT BECAUSE I I SEE.

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:01.121
A HUNDRED ONE CITIES WHICH IS

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.255
PHENOMENAL IT'S THAT BIG DUMB.

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:03.824
AS HE NINE COUNTIES THAT'S

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:04.257
THAT'S AN AMAZING.

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:06.193
TASK BUT I DON'T SEE THEM ON THE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.060
LIST OF SUPPORTERS SO I'VE.

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:08.128
I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A COUPLE

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:09.763
PAGES OF CITY NAMES.

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.665
AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:16.103
OUT -- SO WHY NOT BE A VOLUNTARY

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:20.207
JPA AS OPPOSED.

01:46:20.273 --> 01:46:23.844
TO COMING HERE.

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:24.411
SO.

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:25.345
THIS CAME OUT OF A OF A BROAD

01:46:25.412 --> 01:46:27.781
BASED REGIONAL PROCESS -- AND

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.683

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.551
RECOMMENDATIONS -- I WANT TO

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:40.260
SUPPORT BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.995
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF POLITICS

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:42.796
AROUND.

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:44.965

COMPLICATED -- BUT THERE IS A

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:50.303
LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA I

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.571
THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY ALSO SAY

01:46:51.638 --> 01:46:52.739
YOU DON'T SEE THE CITY'S

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:53.340

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.265
STATE OUT OF THAT.

01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:19.866
ONE BUT I I WILL DO SOME

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.467
RESEARCH IN THE MEANTIME SO I

01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:21.802
CAN GET.

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:22.636
YOU KNOW COMPARISON BASED ON MY

01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:25.305
PERSON AT THE STATE -- BECAUSE A

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:27.240
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE

01:47:27.307 --> 01:47:29.876
CREATING A NEW BUREAUCRACY WHICH

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:32.112
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:35.782
IDEA OR OR SOCIAL IF YOU GET IF

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:36.483
YOU HAVE SOME.

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:37.617
ANSWER THE QUESTION AROUND THE

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:38.451
IDEA OF ANY BUREAUCRACY IT IS

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:39.286
NOT OUR INTENT TO CREATE A NEW

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:41.221
BUREAUCRACY -- IT IS OUR HOPE

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:43.256
THAT -- POTENTIALLY THIS IS

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:44.991
SOMETHING THAT COULD GET GET

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.960
SUBSUMED UNDER WHAT -- YOUR YOUR

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:48.929
CHAIRMAN HAS DESCRIBED AS THE

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:51.064
THE MERGING OF AND TO SEE AN A

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.333
BACK WE ALSO HAVE IN THIS BILL A

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.968
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:58.605
COSTS OF 3% SO ANOTHER IS 97%.

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.906
OF ALL THE FUNDING THAT IS REYES

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:01.641
THROUGH THIS WOULD GO OUT TO

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.409
COUNTIES.

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:04.211
OUT TO CITIES TO BE USED FOR

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:04.945
ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:06.913
HOUSING CRISIS TO THAT WAS ONE

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.415
WAY WHICH WE REALLY CAP TO

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:08.982
ENSURE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:10.951
CREATE A BIG BUREAUCRACY THAT'S

01:48:11.017 --> 01:48:11.618
THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO DO

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.520
HERE -- BUT WE ARE GIVING THE

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:17.090
pITSELF BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:18.358
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:19.926
AND I WOULD SAY TO MEMBERS AND

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.628
SENATORS WHO DO NOT REPRESENT.

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:23.630
THE BAY AREA AN ADVANTAGE OF

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:25.765
SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS IF WE

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:27.033
ARE SUCCESSFUL THE BAY AREA AT

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.935
HELPING TO ADDRESS OUR FORTY

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:29.703
HOUSING CRISIS.

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:31.838
WE WOULD CREATE LESS OF A BURDEN

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.640
OR COMPETITION FOR DOLLARS ON

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:35.175
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT THAN

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:36.710
OTHER PARTS THE STATE WOULD

01:48:36.776 --> 01:48:39.312
WOULD HAVE -- BETTER ACCESS TO

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:40.881
SO THAT IS ANOTHER.

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:47.888
SUGGESTION AS TO WHY HOPE YOU

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.422
MIGHT SUPPORT THIS BILL AS OUR

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:50.056
SO PROBABLY LATE OFF TODAY AND

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:51.558
THEN.

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:52.492
DO SOME MORE RESEARCH FOR

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:53.260
GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND IF

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:54.160
CENTER REQUIRED DOESN'T GIVE YOU

01:48:54.227 --> 01:48:56.096
ENOUGH PUSH BACK LET ME KNOW ALL

01:48:56.162 --> 01:49:00.100
HELP OUT.

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:02.102
WELCOME TO HOUSING COMMITTEE IS.

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:02.602
AGAIN NO COMMENT ON THAT

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:03.937
COLLOQUY [inaudible]

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:06.973
OKAY -- SENATOR SKINNER.

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.211
THANK YOU.

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:12.612
ARM IT IS SOMEONE NUMBER TWO

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.080
WHAT IS THE AND YOU MAY HAVE

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.081
ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS BUT IN

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:16.917
SEE IN THE ANALYSIS BUT IS THERE

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:20.520
A LIMITATION IN THE BILL ON THE

01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:21.588
PERCENT OF FUNDS THAT CAN BE

01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:23.790
USED FOR STAFFORD MINISTRATION.

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:25.592
WE JUST I JUST MENTION IT TO US

01:49:25.659 --> 01:49:27.360
AND WE'RE LIKE 3%.

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:29.930
AND THAT STAFF TO THIS IS ALL

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.564
ADMINISTRATIVE I'M JUST LOOKING

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:33.600
MY STUFF ALL MINISTRY EXPENSES

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:34.134
STAFF INCLUDED.

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.237
OKAY BECAUSE THE THE LANGUAGE IN

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:40.307
THE BILL SHOWS THAT THEY CAN USE

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:41.241
SEVENTY CNA BACK STAFF BUT THEY

01:49:41.308 --> 01:49:45.011
CAN ALSO HIRE STAFF AND SO --

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:49.382
BEGIN MIGHT -- WHEN THIS CONCEPT

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:52.218
WAS FIRST PROPOSED BY THE FOLKS

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.720
IN THE BAY AREA WHO WERE ON?

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:56.089
COMING UP WITH THE A WHOLE HOST

01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:58.124
OF POLICIES THAT COULD HELP

01:49:58.191 --> 01:49:59.426
ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS.

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:01.061
THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS THE

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:02.696
MOST SKEPTICAL ABOUT BECAUSE I

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:03.797
FELT THAT.

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.131
WE DON'T NEED TO CREATE A NEW

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:06.900
BUREAUCRACY THAT WHILE YES

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.835
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ENTITY FOR

01:50:08.902 --> 01:50:10.503
HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA THERE

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:12.605
ARE CERTAINLY -- EVERY LOCAL

01:50:12.672 --> 01:50:14.040
GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE ITS

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:16.009
RESPONSIBILITY AND UNDER LOTS OF

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:17.510
STATE LAWS WHETHER THEY ARE

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:18.979
MEETING THOSE OR NOT IS A

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.714
DIFFERENT STORY BUT THEY DO HAVE

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:21.948
THE RESPONSIBILITY.

01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:26.419
AND I WAS CONCERNED THAT BY THE

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:28.188
TIME SOMETHING NEW GOT

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:30.123
ESTABLISHED AND THEN MONEY WAS

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.825
COOL I MEAN THAT YEAH YOU KNOW

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:33.326
THOUSAND CRISIS IS NOW.

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.562
IT'S NOT A AT FIVE YEARS FROM

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:36.529
NOW.

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:39.065
AND CONSTRUCTION TAKES SO LONG

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:42.102
SO -- I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:44.337
SKEPTICAL I WAS ALSO THE WAY IT

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:47.273
WAS EVER NATIONALLY PRESENTED

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.208
NOT THE LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:48.575
THAT.

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.010
PERHAPS THE SALES TAX MEASURE

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:52.178
WHICH I COMPLETELY OPPOSE FOR

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:54.180
THIS PURPOSE BECAUSE SALES TAX

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:56.082
IS ONE OF THE MOST REGRESSIVE.

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:58.118
TAX MEASURES AND IT IS THOSE

01:50:58.184 --> 01:50:59.386
PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MOST HIT BY

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:01.855
SALES TAX WHO SUPPOSEDLY MIGHT

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:03.723
BENEFIT FROM.

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:07.060
THIS -- IS THE FINANCING

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.628
AUTHORITY THAT THIS WOULD CREATE.

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:11.097
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:13.333
POTENTIALLY OTHER -- REVENUE

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.367
MEASURES THAT ARE BEING

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:16.136
CONSIDERED AND I UNDERSTAND ALSO

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:18.238
THAT SALES TAXES BEEN EXCLUDED

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:22.609
FROM THIS -- I STILL HAVE

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.544
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT REVENUE

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:28.114
MEASURES WOULD BE -- PURSUED ON

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:29.549
LET ME SAY MORTON CONCERNS I'D

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:31.851
SAY RATHER THAT I HAVE BIASES AS

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.453
TO WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE AND

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.256
WHICH SHOULDN'T -- BUT BY THE

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.824
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS WERE

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:38.992
GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO THAT

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.527
INTO DE DETERMINED THAT AND OF

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:41.861
COURSE THEN THE VOTERS TO

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:45.231
APPROVE BUT BECAUSE I DO REALIZE

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:48.268
THAT WE NEED.

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.669
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:51.304
ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.039
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:51:53.106 --> 01:51:54.574
THE HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:59.245
OF ANYWHERE -- THAT.

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.781
IF YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL WAYS TO

01:52:01.848 --> 01:52:03.316
GENERATE REVENUE IN ORDER TO

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:05.018
COVER THE COSTS OF AFFORDABLE

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:06.519
HOUSING.

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.288
IS A LEGITIMATE.

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:13.393
ISSUE SO I WILL -- LOOK FORWARD

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:16.062
TO SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS IN THE

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.664
NEXT COMMITTEE THAT ADDRESS SOME

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:21.968
OF THE CITIES IN AREAS CONCERNS --

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:27.507
AND I WILL -- WHAT I CALL IT I

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:30.143
WILL DO A WILLING SUSPENSION OF?

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.045
DISBELIEF IN TERMS OF WHAT MIGHT

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.481
HAPPEN WITH THIS AND SUPPORT THE

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:36.583
BILL TODAY IN TERMS OF THE

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:40.120
CONCERNS I'VE HAD IN THE PAST.

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:42.956
OKAY -- SEEN OTHER COMMENTS I

01:52:43.022 --> 01:52:43.857

ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS GOING TO

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:51.831
BE OF SOME OF ALL CONTROVERSY SO

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:52.432
APPRECIATE YOUR MOVING THROUGH

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:52.765
THAT.

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.634
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU --

01:52:54.701 --> 01:52:56.603

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:16.990
THE SMALL CITIES IN ALAMEDA

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:17.724
COUNTY.

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:19.025
BOB BASICALLY PUSHING TO SHIP

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:21.327
THIS OF THE SMALL CITIES WOULD

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:23.763
MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS ABOUT IT --

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.999
THERE AND SO THAT THE FEES WOULD

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:27.667
BE GENERALLY PAID BY THE BIG

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.169
CITIES AND THEN SPENT ON THE

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:31.337
SMALL CITIES AND NOT REALLY

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.805
RIDICULOUS -- MEMONS HAS TO BE

01:53:32.872 --> 01:53:34.274
QUITE FRANK AND I JUST WANNA

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.376
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:39.145
THE MEMBER PROCESS -- THAT --

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.013
THAT.

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:41.781
KIND OF THINKING DOESN'T GET ON

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:44.551
MOMENTUM -- THERE ARE SOME WHO --

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:46.419
IT'S IN THE BAY AREA US IN THE

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:48.821
SMALLER -- CITIES -- THAT ARE

01:53:48.888 --> 01:53:50.056
MORE BEDROOM COMMUNITIES -- WILL

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:51.991
POINT TO THE BIG CITIES LIKE

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:53.426
OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO.

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:55.061
AND SAID IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT FOR

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:57.130
CREATING A LOT OF JOBS -- AND

01:53:57.197 --> 01:53:59.732
WE'RE GOOD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:53:59.799 --> 01:54:00.767
CREATE A LOT OF JOBS AND OF

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.435
HOUSING -- BUT OF COURSE THERE

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:04.003
RESIDENTS WORK IN THE CITY'S --

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:05.838
THAT HAVE JOBS AND SO I THINK WE

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:08.241
HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS REGIONALLY --

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:16.216
AMPLE WITH A COPY OUGHT -- THE

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:18.017
SUCH ENJOYING AYE RECOMMENDATION.

01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:19.152

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THIS I

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:21.955
KNOW THIS IS HARD.

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:22.989
WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND SO THE

THOSE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:31.257
OTHER BILLS.

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:32.491
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH -- THESE

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:34.360
COMMITTEES AND WE HAVEN'T QUITE

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:35.528
LANDED AS A LEGISLATURE AND AS A

02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:36.395
NO STAKEHOLDERS ON WHAT THE

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:37.630
RIGHT SOLUTION IS.

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:39.465
AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE.

02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:40.866
TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:43.502
TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC LOOK AT

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.705
WHAT SHOULD STAY GOALS BE AROUND

02:00:45.771 --> 02:00:47.740
TRAINS AND BUS STOPS AND BOWS

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:50.610

HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE --

02:00:58.451 --> 02:00:58.884
BECAUSE DANCING ABOUT A

02:00:58.951 --> 02:00:59.785
CERTAINLY IS A VERY POWERFUL

02:00:59.852 --> 02:01:01.821
TOOL AND IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:04.423
100% AFFORDABLE PROJECT YOU

THANK YOU RESEARCHER I JUST HAD --

02:01:45.431 --> 02:01:47.400
QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS --

02:01:47.466 --> 02:01:49.802
WHAT WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT PARKING --

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:51.270
IT WELL WE ARE ACCEPTING THE

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:51.771
COMMITTEE MINUTES ABOUT

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:52.605
ELIMINATING PARKING FOR SPECIAL

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:53.739
NEEDS HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:54.640
HOUSING IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:57.009
QUESTIONS ABOUT I APOLOGIZE.

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:58.611
FOR SOME CHIU WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.079
ABOUT PARKING IN FIRE SAFETY

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:02.314
CONCERNS AND CONGESTION AND

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:03.549
STREETS AND ALL THE REST AND I I

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:05.518
I I SHOULD HAVE PRACTICED IT A

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.118
LITTLE BIT MORE I APOLOGIZE.

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:07.820
I'VE BEEN IMMERSED TODAY AND WE

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.055
WERE JUST WONDERING ALSO WHY

02:02:09.121 --> 02:02:13.292
JASON HASN'T BEEN HERE ONCE

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:17.596
UNTIL NOW.

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:18.764
SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:20.099
EXCEPT FOR WHAT I JUST MENTION

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:21.500
AS FAR AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

02:02:21.567 --> 02:02:22.101
THAT HAVE TO DO A PARKING SO

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:23.069

THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING FROM THIS

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:25.237
COMMITTEE WOULD ELIMINATE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:25.905
PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:27.339
NEEDS HOUSING AND SUPPORT OF

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:27.940
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS -- THAT

02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:28.841
MAKE A 100% OF THE UNITS

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:30.209
AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:32.311
HOUSEHOLDS AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:35.581
THE IDEAS FOR THOSE PARTICULAR --

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:38.551
COMMUNITY SOME PROJECTS --

02:02:38.617 --> 02:02:40.586
PARKING IS LESS NECESSARY.

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:41.420
THANK YOU IN.

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:44.323
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE.

NO I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:48.527
THE THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:50.663
THE THE PARKING SITUATION WITHIN

SEE BONUS LAW -- YOU KNOW NAY

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:54.667
EVERY IF IT IF AT A DEVELOPER IS

02:02:54.734 --> 02:02:56.135
GOING TO AGREE TO A CERTAIN

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:57.570
AMOUNT OF VENOM RAVEN HUSBAND ME

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:58.003
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.105
AFFORDABILITY THAN THEIR SOME

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:00.840
CONCESSIONS BUT THE PARKING WITH

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:01.440
INTENSITY BONES Là CERTAINLY

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:02.141
REASONABLE.

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:06.612
AND AND WE WOULDN'T OBJECT -- TO

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:07.079
THE COMMITTEES MOMENT.

AND IF THE CAR BY SINCE THE

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:12.885
MOMENT TO COME FROM THE

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:14.186
COMMITTEE.

02:03:14.253 --> 02:03:15.721
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:18.124
LIMITED SUBSET OF HOUSING -- THE

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:19.425
THE CHANCES OF THOSE RESIDENTS

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:20.993
ARE GOING -- TO ON A CAR IS

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:22.995
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER -- AND TO

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:25.765
IMPOSE THAT KIND OF DRAMATIC

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:26.599
COST.

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:28.601
ON TO THESE PROJECTS FOR A

02:03:28.667 --> 02:03:30.336
POPULATION IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:31.470
TO HAVE A CAR -- JUST DOESN'T

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:32.037
MAKE SENSE BUT IT'S A VERY

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:35.674
NARROW SUBSET OF THESE PROJECTS.

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:37.877
ANY ADDITIONAL CENTER CABALLERO.

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:38.577
VERY MUCH -- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:41.213
FIGURE OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS --

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.449
IN ARE GENERALLY -- TRIED TO

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:44.517
STAY AWAY FROM A 100% AFFORDABLE

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:45.050
UNITS BECAUSE OF THE OVER

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:46.519
CONCENTRATION THAT CAN OCCUR

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:48.988
WHEN YOU PUTTING -- A LOT OF

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:50.523
POOR PEOPLE ON ONE PLACE TO HAVE

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:52.591
A SIZE LIMITATION IN TERMS OF OF

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:56.395
YOUR CONCEPT OF OF AND THEN LET

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:57.997
ME JUST PREFACE IT BY SAYING.

02:03:58.063 --> 02:03:59.165
I SUPPORT.

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:00.199
ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:01.600
YOU HAVE IN YOUR BILL I'M JUST

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:02.701
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:05.404
NUMBER ONE IF IF THERE'S IF

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:07.773
THERE IS IF YOU ANTICIPATE SOME

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.375
SIZE LIMITATION ON THE ON THE

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:11.143
SIZE OF A PROJECT NUMBER.

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:12.711
ONE NUMBER TWO IS.

02:04:12.778 --> 02:04:14.780
IF YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:17.750
WORKS WITH CITIES THAT HAVE

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:19.585
EXISTING DENSE -- INCLUSIONARY

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:21.954
HOUSING ORDINANCES WHICH

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:24.089
SOMETIMES INCLUDE DENSITY

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:26.458
BONUSES IF YOU'RE BUILDING

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:28.294
AFFORDABLE UNITS AS WELL -- AND

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.562
THEN ALSO THE IMPACT ON REAL

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:32.064
COMMUNITY SO THAT THE THREE THE

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:33.032
THREE THINGS THAT I WAS TRYING

02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:37.102
TO FIGURE OUT AND I'M NOT SURE I

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:37.736
HAVE AN ANSWER SO I'M WONDERING

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:39.805
IF YOU DO.

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:40.806
SO CENTER I'LL TAKE ONE OF THOSE

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:41.740
DEALS WITH THE THE TYPE OF

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.242
CONSTRUCTION.

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:45.511
AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.213
CHASE AND BROUGHT UP ABOUT.

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:47.813
THE HEIGHT.

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.982
OF THE BULK OF WHAT.

02:04:50.049 --> 02:04:51.016
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:52.852
BUILD IS STICK CONSTRUCTION

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:54.887
VERSUS STEEL CONSTRUCTION AND

02:04:54.954 --> 02:04:56.255
WHAT THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS IS

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:57.523
MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THE LAND

02:04:57.590 --> 02:05:00.392
IN A 1100% AFFORDABLE PROJECT.

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:01.093
IS GOING TO BE FIVE TORIES ARE

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:01.760
LESS.

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:04.630
AND SO THAT IS A VERY BIG

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.098
COMPONENT OF WHAT OUR DEVELOPERS

02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:07.266
LOOK LOOK LOOK.

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:08.601
FOR AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.736
MENTIONED PART OF WHAT THIS BILL

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:11.871
DOES IS ALLOW.

02:05:11.937 --> 02:05:13.439
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:14.874
COMPETE WITH MARKET RATE

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.676
DEVELOPERS MAKING IT A MUCH MORE

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:20.412
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON THE TYPE

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:21.013
OF HOUSING THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.282
BUILT IN THE TRANS.

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:24.316
AND IF I COULD ANSWER.

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:25.284
A COUPLE OF YOUR OTHER PIECES

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.986
THE QUESTION SO WHAT THIS BILL

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:29.221
DOES IS IT STRUCTURES DDITIONAL

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:30.656
DENSITY UNLESS YOU'RE NEAR MAJOR

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:32.157
TRANSIT IN WHICH CASE WE LATER

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:34.326
ON MORE SO.

02:05:34.393 --> 02:05:35.427
WE TRY TO SCULPTED -- DEPENDING

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:36.595
THE AREA SO THAT WOULD MEAN IN A

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:38.097
RURAL AREA YOU COULD RECEIVE A

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:39.932
CERTAIN LEVEL OF DENSITY BUT NOT

02:05:39.999 --> 02:05:42.134
THE MORE THE THE T. MORE

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:43.269
SIGNIFICANT DENSITY THAT YOU

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:44.503
WOULD IF YOU WERE IN AN URBAN

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:46.071
AREA SO THAT'S A PARTIAL ANSWER

02:05:46.138 --> 02:05:48.173
TO YOUR QUESTION -- YOU ALSO

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.342
ASKED ABOUT -- YOUR PERSPECTIVE

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:51.911
WHICH I SHARE THAT WE WHERE

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:54.179
POSSIBLE WOULD NOT WANT -- TO

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.582
OVER CONCENTRATE -- AFFORDABLE

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:58.050
HOUSING -- AND I THINK IDEALLY

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.685
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE BUT WE

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.153
ALL KNOW THAT -- THAT'S EASIER

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.922
SAID THAN DONE ONE AMENDMENT

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.523
THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AT THE

02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:06.191
COMMITTEE SUGGESTION WHICH WE

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:06.725
ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:07.660
COMMITTEE TO DO.

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:09.762
IS TO ALLOW.

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:10.562
FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MODERATE

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:12.197
INCOME WORKFORCE HOUSING

02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:14.033
PROJECTS -- TO RECEIVE THE

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.367
DENSITY BONUSES THAT WE'RE

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:17.002
TALKING ABOUT SO WE'RE NOT JUST

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:18.470
TALKING ABOUT A 100% AFFORDABLE

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.472
HOUSING IN SOME INSTANCES TO

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:22.141
PAYER THE DENSITY BONUS THAT IS

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:24.576
ENHANCED THROUGH THIS BILL WITH

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.111
ARE MIXED INCOME LOAN PROGRAM AT

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.046
CAL HFA.

02:06:27.112 --> 02:06:28.547
WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR MODERATE

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:30.082
INCOME HOUSING TO BENEFIT FROM

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.051
THE DENSITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:33.018
ABOUT SO THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:37.556
THAT -- THE CHAIRED ASKED FOR IN

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.258
A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION.

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:39.992
THAT'S GREAT SO SO THE REASON I

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:41.593
ASKED ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES IS

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:42.828
THAT THE HIGHEST ENTITIES ITS

02:06:42.895 --> 02:06:44.596
ALLOWED IN -- IN.

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:45.397
SALINAS I CAN SPEAK TO THE

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:46.231
SALINAS IN THE SALINAS VALLEY

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:47.633
AND I WANT TO SAY PROBABLY SAN

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.368
BENITO COUNTY IT'S REACHED THREE

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:51.503
STORIES AND IF YOU DRIVE AROUND

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.005
YOU WON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT'S A

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:54.440
THREE STORY.

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.141
APARTMENT BUILDING THAT I CAN

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.910
THINK OF AND SO.

02:06:57.977 --> 02:07:00.579
SO OF IT GOING TO FIVE BECOMES

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.881
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITY

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:04.216
THAN THAN WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.651
SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT.

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:09.488
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:10.122
URBAN AND RURAL AND DO YOU HAVE

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:14.760
A ARE YOU GONNA BE ROLLING --

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:17.329
RURAL COMMUNITY SAID THAT MOVING

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:19.665
21100% AFFORDABLE BUT THE OTHER

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.433
ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH --

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.602
INCLUSION OR HOW HOUSING

02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:25.971
ORDINANCES BECAUSE SOME OF THEM --

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.740
ALLOW THE DENSITY BONUS.

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.341
AT THE ROOT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:31.810
IF YOU ARE BUILDING AFFORDABLE

02:07:31.877 --> 02:07:33.479
UNITS AS PART OF YOUR PROJECT

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:36.548
AND SO HOW DOES THIS WORK THIS

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:38.217
ONE TRUMP THE OTHER OR DO ARE

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:39.518
THEY CUMULATIVE I GUESS IS THE

02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:40.786
QUESTION BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:41.754
ROBLEM.

BEING OVERRIDDEN BY STATE LAW

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:49.962
THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:52.398
GIVING AN EXTRA DENSITY BONUS ON

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:55.434

IS COUNTED WITHIN THE DENSITY

02:08:01.273 --> 02:08:03.475
BONUS SO IT'S NOT CUMULATIVE

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:04.410

DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES HOUSING

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:53.678

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:37.022
OUT HOW IT REALLY WORKS -- SO I

02:16:37.088 --> 02:16:40.191
WILL SAY THAT YOU HAVE CITIES

02:16:40.258 --> 02:16:42.060
THAT -- NY SAID AT THE BEGINNING

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:43.662
UNINTENDED THE FOR SOME FOLKS IT

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:45.797
IS AN INTENDED AND VERY INTENDED

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:46.865
POLICY.

02:16:46.932 --> 02:16:49.634
THAT TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:51.536
SO WE'RE ASKING THAT. FOR THOSE

02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:52.704
THAT ARE UNINTENDED MAYBE THEY

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:54.172
HAVEN'T BEEN ASKING THEMSELVES

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:55.173
THE QUESTION AND ASKING THEM

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:56.207
THOUSANDS OF THE QUESTION IS THE

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:56.641
FIRST STEP TOWARDS.

02:16:56.708 --> 02:16:57.842
THEM HAVING MORE EQUITABLE

02:16:57.909 --> 02:16:59.945
POLICIES IN DECISION MAKING I

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.479
TING FOR THOSE WERE AT IT IS

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:02.814
INTENDED MAYBE PUT IT OUT THERE.

IN WRITING MIGHT GIVE US MY

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:07.686
ALLOW FOLKS WHO LIKE TO WORK. TO

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:08.954
HELP THEM BE MORE EQUITABLE AND

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:10.388
HELP THEM WITH THE POSITION TO

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:11.389
THAT SPOT I THINK WE COULD LOOK

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:13.558
AT IT RECENTLY -- BUT I THINK AT

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:14.492
THE A DAY WE HAVE TO START

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.027
LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT

02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:16.928
THE LOCAL LEVELS OF THE CITY'S

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.330
GET TO HAVE THEIR OWN ORDINANCE.

02:17:18.396 --> 02:17:20.131
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:21.566
EVERYTHING -- AND IT'S JUST A

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:22.767
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND HIS

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.269
CLIENTS TRYING TO CALL ATTENTION.

02:17:24.336 --> 02:17:27.372
I LOOK AT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE --

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.340
AND THEN I LOOK AT NEIGHBORING

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:29.941
COMMITTEES LIKE MINE THAT ARE

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:31.643
BEING NEXT NEXT MY THAT ARE

02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:33.345
BEING IDENTIFIED THAT WERE JUST

02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:34.579
LIKE MINE AND WHO'S BEING PUSHED

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:36.014
OUT AS WE'RE BUILDING UP.

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:37.515
AS WERE REMODELING AS A SERENE

02:17:37.582 --> 02:17:38.950
GENTRIFIED AND PEOPLE BEING

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:40.185
PUSHED OUT OUR PEOPLE I LOOK

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:41.820
LIKE MY COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEING

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:42.787
REPLACED BY.

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:43.989
MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS THAT LOOK

02:17:44.055 --> 02:17:45.557
VERY DIFFERENTLY AND AND THERE'S

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:46.491
NOT THAT BALANCE AND I DO THINK.

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:48.059
THAT WELL I WANT THAT ECONOMIC

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.362
DEVELOPMENT -- AND IN SOME GOOD

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:52.263
THINGS HAVE COME FROM FROM THAT

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:54.265
JUSTIFICATION WE NEED TO BE

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:59.137
ASKING THEMSELVES QUESTIONS IS

02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:00.438
THAT IT'S JUST PRETENDING THAT.

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:01.539
IT DOESN'T MATTER IT DOESN'T

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.174
EXIST BECAUSE TOO OFTEN WE DON'T

02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:04.275
CARE ABOUT THE SMOKE SOMEWHERE.

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:05.343
INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL AT

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:08.246
THAT PRACTICE [inaudible]

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:12.050
SENATOR BATES.

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:14.753
I'M HAVE HAVING SERVED ON LOCAL

02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:16.287
GOVERNMENTS AND HAND THE

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:16.921
STARTING IN A REGIONAL GENERAL

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:18.323
PLAN -- INCORPORATED OUR

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:19.991
COMMUNITY THIS JUST SEEMS SO

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.359
COMPLICATED.

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:22.961
OUR APPROACH RATHER THAN JUST

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:24.729
REQUIRING IN A GENERAL PLAN THAT

02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:25.897
YOU HAVE AN AX NUMBER OF UNITS

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:27.098
THAT ARE.

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:28.333
AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THE A FIFTY

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.267
AFFORDABILITY THAT MAKES THE

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:31.603
DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE LOW INCOME

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.104
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

02:18:33.171 --> 02:18:34.939
IT'S ALL ABOUT AFFORDABILITY.

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:35.907
SO IF YOU HAVE THAT AS YOUR

02:18:35.974 --> 02:18:37.509
MEASURE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU

02:18:37.575 --> 02:18:40.345
MEET THAT STANDARD BUT HAVING

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:41.479
SOME OF THE SUBSETS.

02:18:41.546 --> 02:18:44.382
I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU HOW YOU

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.685
ACHIEVE THAT.

02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:48.853
ANGIE AND I ARE ON THE COUNTY OF

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.355
ORANGE REQUIRED THAT WAS IN THE

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:51.389
EIGHTIES THEY REQUIRE 25%

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:53.658
AFFORDABLE THEY PUT A TWENTY

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:54.125
FIVE YEAR.

02:18:54.192 --> 02:18:55.060
REQUIREMENT THAT THOSE REMAIN

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.128
AFFORDABLE AND I WILL TELL YOU

02:18:57.195 --> 02:19:02.033
WHEN THAT CAME OFF -- THE THE

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.802
THE RUSH TO BUY SOME OF THOSE

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:05.136
HOMES BECAUSE IT WAS REQUIRED IN

02:19:05.203 --> 02:19:06.004
THE COASTAL AREA.

02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:07.706
ALONG THE BEACHES AS A MATTER OF

02:19:07.772 --> 02:19:09.274
FACT THOSE THINGS SOLD LIKE

02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:11.710
HOTCAKES AT MARKET RATES BY THAT

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:13.411
TIME IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE TIMES.

02:19:13.478 --> 02:19:16.047
A WITH THE ORIGINAL OWNERS PAGE

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:17.615
SO THAT THERE WAS A YOU KNOW AN

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:19.417
AMAZING BONUS THAT WAS RECEIVED

02:19:19.484 --> 02:19:20.018
SO.

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:20.685
THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:21.753
LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WHERE YOU

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.054
PUT THE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:25.390
LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:25.957
AFFORDABILITY.

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:27.959
BUT IT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THEY

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.894
HAVE TO STATE AFFORDABLE VERSUS

02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:31.463
THE MARKET RATE SO IT SEEMS TO

02:19:31.529 --> 02:19:32.497
ME IF YOU WOULD REQUIRE AND A

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:33.264
GENERAL PLAN SOMETHING AS BROAD

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:36.768
AS YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN AND

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:37.368
PURPOSE TO IT.

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.237
IN AFFORDABLE LEVEL -- FOR THE

02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:41.406
VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS YOU KIND

02:19:41.473 --> 02:19:42.073
OF SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM.

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.408
THE PUTTING SOME OF THESE OTHER

02:19:43.475 --> 02:19:45.243
SUBSETS IN THERE I THINK THAT

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:47.912
WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. FOR

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:48.847
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHIEF

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:56.287
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GOING TO

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:56.888
HAVE A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF

02:19:56.955 --> 02:19:58.156
THAT.

02:19:58.223 --> 02:20:00.291
IN FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:01.693
AND I SAW OME STATISTICS

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.495
RECENTLY WHERE.

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.029
STATES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TEXAS

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:06.297
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME OR

02:20:06.364 --> 02:20:07.165
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:08.233
THEY HAVE 51% HOMEOWNERSHIP

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:09.768
VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN

02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:11.102
CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY 30% I THINK

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:12.704
IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND 24%.

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:13.872
SO THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:15.774
ARE IN PLACE HERE IN TERMS OF

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:16.908
HOW YOU BUILD HOMES THAT ARE.

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:18.309
KEEPING PEOPLE OUT IN ITS ABOUT

02:20:18.376 --> 02:20:20.211
THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:21.312
THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT AN

02:20:21.379 --> 02:20:22.914
END GENERAL PLAN.

02:20:22.981 --> 02:20:24.015
SO A I'M I'M GONNA STAY OFF

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:25.250
TODAY BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE

02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:27.619
WORKING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:28.153
BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

02:20:28.219 --> 02:20:29.621
SIMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK --

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:32.157
IT BE COOKIE CUTTER FOR EVERY

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:34.092
GENERAL PLAN AND THE STATE OF

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.994
CALIFORNIA THAT'S DEVELOPED BY A

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.195
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BE THAT A

02:20:37.262 --> 02:20:38.263
COUNTY OR CITY.

02:20:38.329 --> 02:20:39.564
GIVE THEM SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:40.598
WORKABLE AND THEN AT THE

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:44.602
MANDATING IT MAKES IT VERY GOOD.

02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:47.772
BUT CHAU TO HELP BE SUBSETS I

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:49.307
THINK THAT -- IT DID VERY

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.543
DIFFICULT DIRECTION TO ASK THEM

02:20:51.609 --> 02:20:53.545
TO GO IN AND I WILL SAY COSTS

02:20:53.611 --> 02:20:54.712
THEM A LOT OF MONEY AND IT CAN

02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:55.113
ELAY.

02:20:55.180 --> 02:21:00.819
DELAY DELAY IN GETTING WHERE YOU

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:04.289
WANT TO GO.

02:21:04.355 --> 02:21:05.857
CENTER MORE LUCK.

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:07.025
SORRY -- SOMEONE WOULD YOU LIKE

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:08.426
TO RESPOND OR I MEAN I I WOULD

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.128
SAY THAT.

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:10.695
WE ARE JUST ASKING THAT THEY

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:12.197
ASKED THE QUESTION WE ARE NOT

02:21:12.263 --> 02:21:13.932
ASKING THAT THEY CARVE OUT OR DO

02:21:13.998 --> 02:21:15.633
ANY PERCENTAGES OF ANY SORT.

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.168
IN THEIR BILL THE FIRST STEP IS

02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:17.735
THAT THE AFTER QUESTION AND

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:18.770
MAYBE IN ASKING THE QUESTION

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.471
THEY MIGHT DECIDE THAT.

02:21:20.538 --> 02:21:21.873
THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.241
THE WHEN THE OFFICE OF THE

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:25.777
QUESTION DO WE SEE THE SEVERITY

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:26.444
HERE MAYBE WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT.

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:27.178
BECAUSE THAT THERE BE AN

02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:28.680
INTENTIONAL BUT THE QUESTIONS

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:30.815
BEING ASKED -- THE IDEA OF

02:21:30.882 --> 02:21:33.384
HAVING -- QUOTAS AND HAVING THEM

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.587
BE FOR MEN IT IS WORTH THE IDEA

02:21:35.653 --> 02:21:37.288
IF I THINK A DIFFERENT BLL FOR

02:21:37.355 --> 02:21:37.922
SOMEONE ELSE TO WORK ON

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:41.526
INCLUDING YOURSELF AND SOMETHING

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:42.060
FOR YOU TO COME IN SALINAS

02:21:42.126 --> 02:21:44.295
CITIES ABOUT.

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:46.197
I CENTER MORE LOCK.

02:21:46.264 --> 02:21:47.832
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE SILLY

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:50.068
WOMAN GARCIA JUST.

02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:52.937
TRYING TO I'M I'M STRUGGLING

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:56.908
LIKE CENTER CARRIER OF TRYING.

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:58.309
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IT

02:21:58.376 --> 02:21:58.877
SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE READING

02:21:58.943 --> 02:22:00.211
HISTORY.

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:00.812
YOU'RE LOOKING BACK AND SAYING

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:01.379
THIS IS THE EVOLUTION OF OUR

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:02.080
CITY.

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:03.748
AND WE WRITE IT DOWN.

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:05.383
AND THEN HOW DOES THAT CHANGE

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:07.652
EVERY FIVE DAY YEARS.

02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:08.686
WHAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WHERE I

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:09.654
BEING IN ASKING THE QUESTION SO

02:22:09.721 --> 02:22:10.922
HOW WE HAVE DONE AND IN HISTORY

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:12.724
HAVE WE DONE IT RIGHT AND WE

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:13.358
HAVE AND THEN A RIGHT CAN WE DO

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:14.726
IT BETTER?

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.194
I THINK WE GET A WE ARE ASKING

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:17.862
WE WILL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:18.696
LIKE TO PRETEND THAT WE ARE

02:22:18.763 --> 02:22:19.330
COLOR COLOR BLIND.

02:22:19.397 --> 02:22:20.899
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY IMPLICIT

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:23.501
BIAS OUT THERE -- AND AND THAT

02:22:23.568 --> 02:22:26.037
WE LIVE IN A PRETTY EQUITABLE

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:28.206
SOCIETY ALREADY AND I THINK PART

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:29.073
OF WHAT I'M ASKING WITH THIS

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.875
BILL IS IS THAT THE REALITY WE

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:32.644
REALLY LIVE IN.

02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:34.045
AND ASKING FOR THOUSAND SOUTH

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.914
SOME UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS AT

02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:37.548
TIMES WE DON'T WANT LIKE BECAUSE

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.816
OF THESE QUESTIONS.

02:22:38.883 --> 02:22:40.118
BUT I'VE SEEN OUR SOUTH SOUTH OF

02:22:40.184 --> 02:22:41.819
UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS ALONG

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:44.522
THE WAY.

02:22:44.589 --> 02:22:45.023
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

02:22:45.089 --> 02:22:47.592
UNCOMFORTABLE [inaudible]

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:50.328
SO I'M.

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:51.696
THERE IS A HISTORICAL.

02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:52.797
ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON OLDER

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:55.800
HOUSING TRACKS TEND TO BE.

02:22:55.867 --> 02:22:57.835
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT

02:22:57.902 --> 02:23:01.572
HISTORICALLY THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:02.941
TEND TO MOVE TO AND AND SOME.

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:04.876
TRYING TO SEE WHAT WOULD THERE

02:23:04.943 --> 02:23:07.078
BE LIKE A A STANDARD FOR

02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:08.079
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON HOW

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:09.113
CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS INVOLVED

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:09.380
AND THEN.

02:23:09.447 --> 02:23:10.982
IF YOU DEVIATE FROM THAT THAT'S

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:12.951
WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE

02:23:13.017 --> 02:23:14.852
CHANGE OF ONE OF MY MISSING

02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:17.055
MISTER GUIDING.

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:18.256
ALL I I THINK IN ANSWER TO

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:19.157
CENTER BASE TO YOUR QUESTION I

02:23:19.223 --> 02:23:19.924
THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:23:19.991 --> 02:23:21.826
THAT THERE HAS BEEN --

02:23:21.893 --> 02:23:23.695
DISCRIMINATORY HISTORY IN THE

02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:24.963
STATE WITH HOUSING AND IN FACT

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:27.165
MOST PLANS ALREADY INCLUDE LOW

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:29.901
VERY LOW ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:31.035
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN MET BECAUSE

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:32.637
WE'RE AT THE CRISIS WERE AT NOW

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:35.340
I THINK WHAT THIS BILL **** FOR

02:23:35.406 --> 02:23:36.708
IT AS THE AUTHOR SAID TO TO TAKE

02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:38.543
A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE PATTERNS

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:40.945
HAVE BEEN AND TO ASK IF THIS NEW

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:44.415
HOUSING IS GOING.

02:23:44.482 --> 02:23:46.084
TO CONTINUE THAT PATTERN.

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:47.118
I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A VERY

02:23:47.185 --> 02:23:47.986
SIMPLE QUESTION THAT THAT THAT

02:23:48.052 --> 02:23:49.120
CITY PLANNERS HAVE TO ASK

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:51.656
THEMSELVES.

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:53.858
HELLO SENATOR -- SKINNER IS

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:55.927
MENTIONED A BOOK A COUPLE TIMES

02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:59.864
IN COMMITTEE ISOLATE.

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:01.933
WHO WOULD THAT BE COLOR OF LAW

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:02.867
SO SO THAT WOULD BE A HISTORICAL

02:24:02.934 --> 02:24:05.436
OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU COULD?

02:24:05.503 --> 02:24:08.373
USE IS A MIRROR THEN. THREE

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:09.607
SEVEN YEARS THIS APPROACH MISSES

02:24:09.674 --> 02:24:11.109
WHAT YOUR CITY IS DONE AND

02:24:11.175 --> 02:24:15.079
HERE'S WHERE THE SELF EVALUATION

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:16.914
OR REFLECTION.

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:17.582
SHOULD COLLECTIVELY COME FROM I

02:24:17.648 --> 02:24:18.916
DON'T THINK I I DON'T THINK

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:20.551
THAT'S THE CASE CENTER I THINK

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:22.053
WHAT THE BOOK DOES THIS POINT

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.588
OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN THE

02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:25.523
PRIVATE SECTOR ROLE IN THE

02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:27.825
HOUSING PATTERNS WE HAVE IN THE

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:28.026
STATE.

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:30.928
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.130
AND SO AS A AS AN

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:34.365
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT HISTORY

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:36.267
AND GOING FORWARD WE'RE ASKING

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:38.569
CITIES AND COUNTIES TO LOOK AT

02:24:38.636 --> 02:24:40.905
THEIR THEIR GENERAL PLANS AND

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:42.273
ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAS HAPPENED

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.741
AND PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:45.343
AGAIN.

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:48.679
BEST OF THOUGHT.

02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:50.248
BUT IF THEY LOOK AT IT AND THEY

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:53.184
DON'T SEE SOMETHING.

02:24:53.251 --> 02:24:54.452
THAT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WOULD

02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:56.487
WHO'S THE REFEREE TO HELP THEM

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:59.824
OUT AS ARE GONNA BE LIKE A COACH

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:00.491
THAT'LL.

02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:03.127
HELP OUT OF THESE GENERAL PLANS

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:04.295
TO SAY WELL LOOK AT THIS POINTS

02:25:04.362 --> 02:25:04.529
BY YOU.

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:05.530
TOTALLY MISSED IT.

02:25:05.596 --> 02:25:06.130
I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT CITIES

02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:07.732
OFTEN ENGAGE IN PROCESSES THAT

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:09.300
ARE BUT WITH THE PUBLIC THAT ARE

02:25:09.367 --> 02:25:10.034
WITH CONSULTANTS.

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:11.169
I TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BEST

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:13.838
DO THIS AN ANSWER THIS QUESTION

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:15.807
AND GET THESE ANSWERS -- AND SO

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.475
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT.

02:25:17.542 --> 02:25:19.110
I'M CONFIDENT CITIES WILL TRY TO

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:20.478
FIGURE OUT AND AND IF THEY DON'T

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:21.813
I'M CONFIDENT THAT HOPEFULLY IN

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.214
SOME OF THESE COMMUNITY STILL BE.

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:25.850
FOLKS WHO ARE ALERT AND AWARE

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:27.485
AND ARE GONNA SAY HEY THIS IS

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:28.586
NOT WITHIN THE SPREAD OF WHAT

02:25:28.653 --> 02:25:29.620
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HEAVY

02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:30.588
ASK YOURSELF.

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:32.356
THESE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO MAKE

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:33.791
SURE WE'RE NOT REPEATING

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:35.927
PATTERNS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:35.993 --> 02:25:37.462
WE ARE LEARNING WE WANT TO MAKE

02:25:37.528 --> 02:25:38.396
SURE WE'RE TAKING THE LESSONS IN

02:25:38.463 --> 02:25:38.696
THE BOOKS.

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:40.498
THAT ARE OUT THERE IN TRYING TO

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:43.935
SAY HOW CAN WE DO IT BETTER WE

02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:45.203
ALSO IN LOSS EVERY HUMAN BEINGS

WAYS I THINK IT WILL BE VERY

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.114
USEFUL.

02:28:10.181 --> 02:28:12.450
FIRST OF ALL IT'S AS FORCING

02:28:12.516 --> 02:28:13.851

THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT --

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:37.008
GETTING CITIES TO ALLOW MORE

02:28:37.074 --> 02:28:39.143

WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.

02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.081
BUT WE KNOW THAT CITIES WILL

02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:46.150
SOMETIMES PUT ALL THEIR FORMAL

02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:47.852
HOUSING IN JUST ONE AREA --

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:49.587
