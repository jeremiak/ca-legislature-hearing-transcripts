01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.754
THEIR HOMES TO FLEE PERSECUTION

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:19.888
AND VIOLENCE.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.089
THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN LEAVE

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.358
MUCH BEHIND INCLUDING THEIR JOB

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:23.992
THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.027
COMMUNITIES.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:26.528
THEY'VE BEEN EMBARK ON A LONG

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.597
AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS JOURNEY

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.865
TO TRY TO GET TO SAFETY.

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:31.800
IN THEIR NEW HOMES REFUGEES

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.502
OFTEN FACE MANY CHALLENGES TO

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:34.903
GAIN ASYLUM AND TO HEAL FROM THE

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.205
TRAUMA.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:37.706
IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL THAT WE

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:38.774
WELCOME THESE VULNERABLE

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.108
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.777
COMPASSION REGARDLESS OF THE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:44.046
RACE RELIGION GENDER IDENTITY OR

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.681
SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.748
THIS COMPASSION MUST BE

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.917
REFLECTED IN IN IN OUR REFUGEE

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.752
SETTLEMENT POLICIES AND WE MUST

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.087
SUPPORT SUPPORT THEM IN CREATING

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.388
A NEW LIFE.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.757
I CAN REMEMBER IN APPROXIMATELY

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.259
NINETEEN NINETY WHEN THE FIRST --

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.328
ERITREANS AND SOMALIANS CAME TO

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.229
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.697
AND THEY WERE ALL SETTLED IN SAN

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.865
DIEGO.

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.666
AND I GOT A CALL ONE WEEKEND

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:06.368
SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE AN

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:08.470
ADDITIONAL COUPLE OF TWENTY

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:10.272
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO AND

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.907
AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE IN YOUR

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:12.941
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.009
AND SO WE HAD A TREMENDOUS

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.777
CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.012
THAT THEY WERE WELCOMED.

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.480
AND I WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:19.748
OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNSELORS

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.717
TOOK THEM IN UNDERSTOOD THE

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.452
CHALLENGES THAT WOULD BE A TRIED

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.786
TO MAKE A PLACE FOR THEM.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.488
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND HIRED

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.190
INDIVIDUALS TO COME IT AND TO TO

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.292
BASICALLY MAKE THE TRANSITION TO

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.760
CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO A SMOOTH

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:32.995
TRANSITION.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.496
AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT I SEE

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.398
AS I SEE THE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.033
WHO WERE ONCE A PART OF THAT --

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.434
THAT WHOLE TRANSITION THAT

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.637
OCCURRED I SAW THE BRILLIANCE OF

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:42.504
THE YOUNG FOLKS THAT ARE THERE

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.772
THAT ARE NOW SERVING IN OUR

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.974
COMMUNITIES SOME TWENTY THIRTY

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.709
YEARS LATER WILL REALLY MAKING A

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:48.377
DIFFERENCE.

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.679
THE YOUNG MAN WHO WON THE FIRST

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.981
AMERICANS TO WIN THE THE THE

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.683
MARATHON IN NEW YORK OF THE

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.818
BOSTON MARATHON OF WAS THERE AND

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.253
HE WAS A MAN HE WAS A PART OF

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.288
THE IMMIGRANTS.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:01.189
AND THE REFUGEE COMMUNITY

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.225
INSTEAD DIEGO HE MADE HIS FAMILY

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.726
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO RUN

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.595
EVERYWHERE AND THEY WERE WINNING

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.130
ALL KINDS OF RACES IN THE SCHOOL

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:08.897
DISTRICT.

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.432
AND I REMEMBER CELEBRATING HIM

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.467
AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND NOW

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.468
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S A

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.103
CELEBRATED THE CROWN THE WORLD

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.271
AND AND WAS PROMISING TO COME

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.040
HERE. TO MEET US AND I THINK

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.008
ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.777
REFUGEE HIS FAMILY WAS THEY CAME

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.178
HERE WITHOUT ANYTHING.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.446
AND THEY WILL EMBRACE

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.014
FORTUNATELY BY THE AFRICAN

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.849
AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHO FORMED A

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.351
NUMBER OF ALLIANCES TO MAKE SURE

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.953
THAT SOME THE TRANSITION WAS

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:31.687
MOVED.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:32.821
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.389
OFTENTIMES THE RECEPTION OF OF

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.692
OF THE REFUGEE IS NOT AFRICAN IS

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.560
NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND AS A

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.195
RESULT WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO NOT

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.997
INCLUDE THEM IN THE ONGOING

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.131
DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE THERE ABOUT

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:44.399
HOW DO WE CREATE.

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.001
A SMOOTH TRANSITION HOW DO WE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.236
HONOR THEIR ETHNICITY IN THE

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:48.804
CULTURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:49.638
THAT COME IN.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.706
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN US

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.107
WILL DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY BUT

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.575
NONE THE LESS VALUE THEM AS

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:54.910
INDIVIDUALS AND MAKING SURE

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.011
THEY'RE PART OF IT.

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.913
SAN DIEGO HAS AN AMAZING REFUGEE

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.114
COMMUNITY NOW THAT HAS BEEN

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:01.083
COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO OUR

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:03.051
SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.720
AND MAKES US PROUD EVERYDAY WHEN

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.555
WE SEE THEM WE SEE THE KIND OF

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:07.889
WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THE

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:08.890
THINGS THAT THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:09.624
TO US.

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:13.895
SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:14.463
THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.130
COUNTRY.

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:16.331
A COUNTRY MADE OF REFUGEES

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.199
BASICALLY FOLKS WHO COME FROM

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:18.300
PLACES EVEN THE FIRST ONES WHO

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.167
CAME HERE WERE FLEEING SO CALL

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.436
RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION LOOKING

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:22.471
FOR A PLACE IN WHICH THEY COULD

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:22.971
LIVE.

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:25.273
IN PEACE AND HARMONY WITH OTHERS

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.641
THAT'S WHO WE ARE THAT'S WHAT

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.043
THIS NATION IS ABOUT AND AS A

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.778
RESULT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.580
AN ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.081
MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS NATION

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.283
REMAINS A PLACE A SAFE PLACE.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.651
FOR PEOPLE TO COME IT IS A PART

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:38.587
OF THE LEGACY AND FOR US TO DENY

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.288
THAT AS OUR LEGACY IS TO DENY

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.289
WHO WE ARE.

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:42.724
IT IS DOES NOT ALL THOSE WHO

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:43.892
STRUGGLE SO HARD TO GIVE A

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.460
FOUNDATION TO THIS NATION TO

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.129
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:47.596
TO STAY.

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.197
AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD NEVER

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.866
REFUGEES WE KNOW THAT THEY

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:51.967
DIDN'T COME TO THIS COUNTRY

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:53.235
WILLINGLY NOBODY SEEKING A SAFE

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.436
HAVEN.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.604
AND SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.072
LIKE TO BE LEFT OUT BE LOCKED

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:58.640
OUT AND DO NOT BE GIVEN A FULL

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.575
CHANCE AND OPPORTUNITY AND AS A

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.177
RESULT OF THAT THE COMPASSION IS

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:03.678
GREAT IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THOSE

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:04.413
WILL COME.

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:05.680
