THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS I AM PROUD AND HONORED TO JOIN YOU TODAY AS WE COMMEMORATE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATE THE INCREDIBLE WOMEN LEADERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT RUTH PATER GINSBURG. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRAILBLAZER IN THE FIGHT FOR REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN FROM SMALL AND BIG CITY MAYORS TO MEMBERS AND LEADERS OF OUR STATE LEGISLATURE TO THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE U. S. SENATE. AND NOW THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA WOMEN LEAD THE WAY. IN SO MANY WAYS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WOMEN BELONG AT THE TABLE THAT OUR VOICES COUNT AND THAT OUR LEADERSHIP IS FAIR JUST EFFECTIVE AND INSPIRING. IT'S TRUE NOT ONLY IN GOVERNMENT BUT IN ALL SECTORS OF CIVIC AND BUSINESS LEADERSHIP AS WELL. THIS BODY MADE THAT CLEAR WHEN IT VOTED TO APPROVE LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE MORE WOMEN ON CORPORATE BOARDS THAT LEGISLATION IS NOW LAW THANKS TO FORMER SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON HERSELF NOW AN ICONIC AND HISTORIC LEADER. AND EACH YEAR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FINDS MORE WAYS TO MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR STATE MORE EQUITABLE. THIS YEAR I'M EXCITED TO SPONSOR THE GENDER EQUITY IN LEADERSHIP PACKED IN THE ASSEMBLY TO UPDATE OUR MALE PRONOUN HEAVY GOVERNMENT COAT. ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA LAW AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS ALWAYS DEFINED AS HE HE- I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT ANOTHER MEASURE HERE IN THE SENATE TO CORRECT SIMILARLY GENDERED CODE SECTIONS ABOUT THE CHP COMMISSIONER WHO AS YOU ALL KNOW IS NOW COMMISSIONER AMANDA READ. ALSO A WOMAN AND AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE AT THAT. COMMISSIONER RAY AND I MAY BE THE FIRST WOMEN IN OUR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS BUT TO BORROW A LINE FROM VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WE MAY BE THE FIRST BUT WE WON'T BE THE LAST THROUGH CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT CODE TO REFLECT THIS FACT. IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR I HOPE. I'M ALSO VERY PROUD TO BE HERE AS YOU PROCLAIM MARCH FIFTEENTH JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG DAY. RBG WAS IT TOWERING FIGURE A GREAT WARRIOR FOR WOMEN JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY YOUR ACTION TODAY WILL HELP ENSURE THAT SHE WILL SERVE AS AN INDURAIN SYMBOL OF HOPE AND STRENGTH FOR WOMEN. AND FOR ALL PEOPLE SEEKING A FAIRER MORE EQUITABLE WORLD. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. S. RBG ONCE SAID REAL CHANGE IN DURING CHANGE HAPPENS ONE STEP AT A TIME. I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU AS WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL HERE IN THE BEAUTIFUL STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

WHO ARE ON SONG AND I'M RECOGNIZED AND TOO FREQUENTLY ABSENT FROM OUR HISTORY BOOKS. WE ESPECIALLY HONOR THOSE WOMEN WHO CAME BEFORE ON ON WHOSE SHOULDERS WE STAND. I KNOW I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY FROM OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR FROM GARDENIA WHO GAVE US SO MANY FIRSTS WHEN HE WAS DOING BLACK HISTORY MONTH SO. IRAQ'S THE CUP OF COFFEE YOU PROBABLY DURING THIS FIRST MORNING OF THE CLOCKS MOVING FORWARD YOU CAN THANK THE LEADER PENS WHO INVENTED THE COFFEE FILTER. THAT IS WE USE THE INTERNET TO HOLD YOU MEETINGS THANK YOU LAMAR WHO DURING WORLD WAR TWO DEVELOPED EARLY WIFI TO PREVENT TORPEDOES FROM BEING. TEMPTED SHE ALSO FILED THE FIRST PATENTS FOR GPS AND BLUETOOTH. THAT IS WE GET OUR VACCINATIONS WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON DNA SCIENCE WE CAN THAK ROSALIND FRANKLIN NOT WATSON AND CRICK FOR THE DOUBLE HELIX. BADLY TEACHER GREER WHO INVENTED THE MEDICAL. SYRINGE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE. AND AS WE JUGGLE RISK. AT HOME DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WE CAN CERTAINLY BE THANKFUL TO JOSEPHINE COCHRAN FOR INVENTING THE DISHWASHER. CALLER ID AND CALL WAITING WERE INVENTED IN THE SEVENTIES BY SHIRLEY ANN JACKSON WHO IS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO GET A PHD FROM. MIT AND IF YOU THINK ALL HIGH ROLLERS ARE MEN THEN YOU'VE MISSED THE FACT THAT OUR FAVORITE BOARD GAME MONOPOLY WAS INVENTED BY ELIZABETH MACKEY. SO HERE IN THE STATE SENATE SEVERAL OF OUR OWN HAVE BROKEN GLASS CEILINGS FOR EXAMPLE. I AM THE ONLY SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF ANY PARTY TO A BROKEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES. SENATE PRO TEM ATKINS IS THE FIRST WOMAN. AND THE FIRST OPENLY LGBT PERSON TO LEAD THE STATE SENATE AS WELL AS THE FIRST SPEAKER TO BECOME THE SENATE PRO TEM. SENATOR PATRICIA BATES WAS THE FIRST FEMALE AN OVERALL MAYOR OF LAGUNA NIGEL AFTER SPEARHEADING THE INCORPORATION OF THE CITY AND A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN WOMEN'S CAUCUS. SENATOR ANNA CABALLERO THE FIRST FEMALE MAYOR OF SALINAS AND THE HIGHEST RANKING LATINA IN STATE GOVERNMENT WHEN SHE WAS APPOINTED. BY GOVERNOR BROWN TO SECRETARY BUSINESS SENATOR MARIA ELENA DURAZO THE FIRST FEMALE SECRETARY TREASURER OF LA COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR THE SECOND LARGEST LABOR COUNCIL IN THE COUNTRY. SENATOR SUSAN EGGMAN THE FIRST LATINA TO SERVE SENATE DISTRICT FIVE AND THE FIRST OPENLY LGBTQ ARTIST WITHIN AND STATE SENATE. SENATOR SANTANA GROWTH FOR THE FIRST FEMALE VETERANS ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. SENATOR ELENA GONZALEZ THE FIRST WOMAN OF COLOR TO LEAD SENATE TRANSPORTATION SENATOR MELISSA HURTADO THE YOUNGEST WOMAN EVER ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. AND OUR SENATORS COM LARGER FIRST WOMAN TO WIN BOTH THE FOR ELECTIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE BY SPECIAL ELECTION. SENATOR CONNIE LEYVA FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE WIDE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION SENATOR MONIQUE LIMON THE FIRST LATINO TO SERVE IN THE NINETEENTH SENATE DISTRICT. SENATOR MELISSA MELENDEZ ONE OF THE FIRST WOMEN APPROVED TO FLY ABOARD IN EP THREE RUN ACROSS RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT OVERSEAS SENATOR ROSALIE C. BUT CHAIR BOB FIRST REPUBLICAN WOMAN TO SERVE THE TWENTY THIRD SENATE DISTRICT SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO. FIRSTLY CHEN LATINO CHAIR OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. IN WITH OUR- FEMALE. FIRST FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA'S. BONE KAMALA HARRIS. WHO IS WE ARE. NOT ON THE DOORS OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND PETER GINSBERG WHO'S EIGHTY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY WE CELEBRATE TODAY. WE CAN THANK FOR HER LANDMARK CASE WHICH STOPPED DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX. SO ALL OF THESE WOMEN I MENTIONED. I'VE MADE GREAT CRACKS IN THE GLASS CEILING HOWEVER THERE IS MUCH WORK WE STILL MUST DO TO LIFT WOMEN UP TO ACHIEVE GENDER EQUITY IN PAY. AND IN THE ROLES OF POWER IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT AS EXAMPLE RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN STATE LEGISLATURE ONLY THIRTY SEVEN. OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. WE STILL HAVE TO DO MUCH TO HAVE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT TAKEN SERIOUSLY. TO HAVE OUR WOMEN'S WORK GIVEN THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC VALUE. WHEN WE SEE THAT THE LOWEST PAID JOB CATEGORIES CONTINUE TO BE FEMALE DOMINATED TEACHERS CHILD CARE WORKERS THOSE CARING FOR SENIORS AND MANY MANY OTHERS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. EVEN WHILE WE KNOW. THAT THOSE JOBS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF A VIBRANT ECONOMY WITHOUT WHICH WE WOULD NOT HAVE A HEALTHY ECONOMY. SO WE KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. AND WHAT ABOUT OUR REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF WOMEN'S UNPAID DOMESTIC LABOR. THE CARE AND RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS GIVEN TO CHILDREN TO SENIORS AND DISABLED IN THAT WOMAN'S HOUSEHOLD OR FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT UPKEEP IN OTHER TASKS. THAT WOMEN TAKE ON AND FOR WHICH OUR ECONOMIES ABSOLUTELY DEPEND IN TWENTY NINETEEN KANARIS ESTIMATED THAT IF AMERICAN WOMEN HAD BEEN AMERICAN WOMEN. HAD BEEN PAID MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE- HOURS UNPAID WORK THAT THEY DID AROUND. THE HOUSE IN CARING FOR RELATIVES. WE WANTED WOULD HAVE MADE ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS. BUT WE DO NOT TAKE STOCK OF THAT VALUE UNTIL THERE IS A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT POINT ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH 197590% OF THE WOMEN RESIDENTS OF ICELAND REFUSED TO COOK. TO CLEAN TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN TO DO ANY OF THE OTHER NORMAL WORK THAT WOMEN ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED TO DO. IT BROUGHT I SLIMMED TO A STANDSTILL. IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY SCRAMBLE TO FILL IN TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO WORK OVERWHELMING RESTAURANTS YOU NAME IT THIS PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED A DOUBLE WHAMMY ON WOMEN. THOSE WHO ARE PAID TO DO DOMESTIC LABOUR IN LOW WAGE SERVICE JOBS CHILD CARE AND OTHERS LOST THEIR JOBS AND THAT URDEN DISPROPORTIONATELY FELL ON WOMEN OF COLOR. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE DOWNTURN FOR EXAMPLE THE EMPLOYMENT FOR BLACK AND LATINA WOMEN FELL BY OVER TWENTY PERCENT. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE ENTIRE JOB LOSS WITH WOMEN OF COLOR. WOMEN OF COLOR LOST MORE THAN TWO TIMES THE DECLINE OF UNEMPLOYMENT OF EMPLOYMENT FOR WHITE WOMEN AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE DECLINE FOR MEN. AND THOSE THAT DID NOT LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEY PAID USUALLY RELIED ON OTHERS THAT THEY PAID TO DO THAT WORK. HOW TO DO IT THEMSELVES WHILE STILL DOING THEIR OWN PAID JOBS SO MANY OF THOSE WOMEN LEFT THE WORK FORCE. CORONAVIRUS STOPPED WOMEN IN THEIR TRACKS NOT ONLY DID WE LOSE JOBS OR HAVE HOURS CUT WE LEFT JOBS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO DO THAT UNPAID DOMESTIC LABOR BUT US. SO WOMEN'S ECONOMIC STATUS IN OUR WORKPLACE EQUALITY WON'T HAVE BEEN SET BACK DECADES BY THIS CRISIS ON LAST WEEK THE STATE'S LEADERS INTERVENE TO AVERT IT AND AS POLICY MAKERS AND AS A SOCIETY WE NEED TO DO BETTER. TODAY WE REMEMBER AND CELEBRATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WOMEN AND WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO BRING EQUITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE TO THE WOMEN WHO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES OUR STATE AND OUR NATION GREAT. NOW EACH OF YOU HAVE CHOSEN AN EXEMPLARY LEADER FROM YOUR DISTRICT TO HONOR AS YOU'RE A WOMAN OF THE YEAR. WOMEN WHOSE HISTORY WILL BE READ FOR GENERATIONS TO COME WOMEN FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE FOR MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE STATE SENATE HONORS AND HAS DEEP GRATITUDE FOR ALL OF THE WOMEN THAT YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALLY CHOSEN TO HONOR WE HAVE COMPILED THE COMMEMORATIVE BOOKLET. OF YOUR AMAZING STORIES OF THOSE WOMEN AS WELL AS A GIFT BAG FOR YOUR HONOREE THAT YOU CAN PICK UP ONE SESSION HAS CONCLUDED TODAY. SO I URGE ALL OF YOU TO TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS WOMAN'S INCREDIBLE STORIES OF ACHIEVEMENT AND SERVICE. AND I HOPE THAT WE ALL COMMIT.

BUT EITHER WAY- THE PROFESSOR OF THIS TAX CLASS WAS- RETREAT PETER GINSBURG'S HUSBAND. AND I ENJOYED LEARNING AND- FROM HIM WHEN I WAS THERE BUT WHAT REALLY STOOD OUT. IS EVERY SO OFTEN. AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WOULD BE. THIS PERSON THAT WOULD COME ONTO CAMPUS. AND SHE HAD A SLIGHT FRAME. VERY SMALL VERY PETITE. AND THAT OF COURSE WAS RECRUITER GINSBURG COMING TO HAVE LUNCH OR HAVE A SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT WITH HER HUSBAND OVER THE LAW SCHOOL. SHE WOULD WALK ON THE CAMPUS. EVEN WITH HER SLIGHT FRAME. SHE WAS A GIANT. AND WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HER POLITICAL PHILOSOPHIES OR HER LEGAL PHILOSOPHIES. I THINK IT'S THEIR RESPECTIVE AT THIS POINT SHE HAS TRULY MADE HER MARK. AS A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JUDICIARY AND FOR THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HONOR ALL THAT SHE HAS ONE TO IMPROVE HOW OUR LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS. OUR EQUITY SYSTEM WORKS- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. I THINK LAW IS AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE. AND SO THAT I WANT TO APPLAUD- THE AUTHOR OF THIS- THIS MOTION- FOR THIS BILL- THE SENATOR FROM BALDWIN PARK I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU SENATOR GORGEOUS SENATOR TO RUSSELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION CELEBRATING OUR LATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BIRTHDAY. DINNER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ON THE BENCH JUSTICE GINSBURG GINSBURG DRAFT CRAFTED A LEGACY THAT HELPED SHAPE OUR SOCIETY. SO EVEN IF SHE WAS WRITING DISSENTS AGAINST THE MAJORITY DECISION AND SHE WOULD SAY. THE DISSENTERS HOPE THAT THEY ARE READY NOT FOR TODAY BUT FOR TOMORROW AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE LEAD BETTER CASE. ATTRIBUTED WERE INFLUENCING THE LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT. THIS IS IMPORTANT JUSTICE GINSBURG ALSO HAD A LASTING IMPACT ON IMMIGRANTS. INCLUDING HELPING TO OVERTURN THE ATTEMPT TO END THE DACA PROGRAM. VOTING WITH THE MAJORITY TO OVERTURN THE CONTROVERSIAL TWENTY TEN ARIZONA IS BE TEN SEVENTY. THAT ALLOWED OFFICERS TO DETAIN ANYONE THEY SUSPECTED TO BE UNDOCUMENTED. VOTED IN FAVOR OF UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR UNDOCUMENTED TO CHALLENGE THEIR DETENTION IN GOVERNMENT CUSTODY.

RBG LIVED A REMARKABLE LIFE ONE CENTERED ON JUSTICE AND EQUITY WHICH IS NOT TO SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH ANY OF THE AMAZING THING SHE WAS KNOWN FOR. HER STORY IS A TESTAMENT TO DEFYING THE ODDS GROWING UP FEMALE AND JEWISH AND WORKING CLASS WHEN BEING AT A TIME WHEN COULD BE ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS WITH AN IMPEDIMENT TO SUCCESS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK LAID OUT MANY OF THE REMARKABLE GLASS CEILING SHATTERING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HER CAREER I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THROUGH THAT TIME SHE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF OUR VALUES. SHE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY RELENTLESSLY FOR EQUAL RIGHTS WHETHER FOR WOMEN FOR RACIAL MINORITIES OR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WHETHER AS A YOUNG LAWYER OR WHILE ON THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KIMBER BEGINS BURKE FOUGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND SOUGHT TO EMPOWER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. SHE CREATED BETTER WORLD FOR US AND FOR OUR CHILDREN AND SHE BLAZED A TRAIL FOR MILLIONS OF YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS INCLUDING MY EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND ME. TO FOLLOW. NOW AFTER HER DAY WE'VE BEEN FROM THE FRUITS OF HER LABOR BUT HER LEGACY WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE US. MANY HAVE SAID MAY HER MEMORY BE A BLESSING AND A REVOLUTION. AND I WANT TO JUST PAUSE ON THIS BECAUSE IT GOES TO THE HEART OF HOW REMEMBRANCES ACTIVE AND NOT PASSIVE. IF WE WANT TO TRULY HONOR THE LEGACY OF THE NOTORIOUS RBG. WE MUST ACTIVELY FIGHT FOR PROGRESS INEQUALITY. EVEN WHEN. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ODDS SEEM STACKED AGAINST US THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO HONOR THE LIFE.
