TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONGOING ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES FOR THE MILITARY OUR- RESOURCES MORE HANDS THE CURRENT. LOGISTICAL AND ADVANCES GOAL.

THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDING POLICY EXPERTS. CAN MEET BASED ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY AS A PROBATION TO MOVE TOWARDS IMPROVE SERVICE CONTINUE AFTER JUSTIN JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. IN A REVISION PROPOSAL EXPANSIVE POLICY UNIT AND THE COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT AS WELL AS WITH THE- CREATING A SEPARATE OMBUDSPERSON YEAR TO EXPAND STOPPING TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS AND SEE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. THERE'S AUTHORED FOR CONTRACT FUNDS TO IDENTIFY TRAUMA RESPONSIVE CULTURALLY IMPROVED INFORMED MODELS OF CARE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR SERVING JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. I AM JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE MISS WELSH THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. WE'RE PARTICULARLY THE L. A. L. JOINT STATE WE HAVE AN OPERATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE. THIS IS THE CASE LARA AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NOT RAISED CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE A QUESTION I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE AMOUNT HAS DOUBLED FROM THREE POINT FOUR TO SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION TH. YES THIS QUESTIONS THE APPROXIMATE. NUMBERS WITH THAT WAS CLOSER TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SO CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO. HOW YOU. COME TO THE CONCLUSION. THAT THIS IS THE ADEQUATE AMOUNT. SURE I'M HAPPY TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL AND THEN I WOULD INVITE MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT. SO BE IT AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REALLY TO ENHANCE THE POLICY UNIT THAT COUNTY IN COORDINATION UNIT. AND THE- CREATING AN OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON BUT IF MISSPELLED LIKE THAT FURTHER AND PROVIDE MORE DETAILS THAT SHOULD. SURE YES I YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED WITH THE ADVOCATES BETWEEN THE TIME WE WERE HERE LAST I THINK IN EARLY MARCH- AND TODAY AND- ONE OF THE THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT MODELS THAT THEY SHARED WITH US- ONE WAS LOOKING AT TEXAS AM AND THE OTHER WAS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR OWN FOSTER CARE ARMS PERSONS OFFICE. I GUESS THE DISTINCTIONS THAT I WOULD SHARE IS THAT FOR THE TEXAS MODEL- THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND FACILITY OVERSIGHT OF WHICH IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT IN OUR SYSTEM IN OUR STATE IS. IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SEC I THINK WHERE WE REALLY WANTED TO INVEST- WAS ONE TO CREATE A SEPARATE UNIT AT BEYONCE PERCENT WHICH INCLUDES THE UNIT CHIF THAT REPORTS TO A NEW DEPUTY DEPUTY DIRECTOR THAT REPORTS TO THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND I THINK THAT THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CALLS AND MAKE THOSE REFERRALS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE FOR THAT ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND YOUNG. PEOPLE WHO WILL BE. PAGE TEN AT IN OUT OF HOME PLACE- WOULD BE THIS OF THE ALMOST PERSONS. AND SO- I THINK THAT WITH THAT IS THAT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY NEW AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY JUST GETTING FEEDBACK IN TALKING TO SOME OF OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS WAS. THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR CON. TRACT FUNDS AND- YEAH THESE ARE- IN MANY CASES. INTERVENTIONS THAT WE NEED TO EITHER ENHANCE IN COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THEM WHAT IS SUPPORT- OUR LOCAL. IMPLEMENTERS TO WORK REGIONALLY NEEDS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO SOMETHING NEW AND INNOVATIVE THINGS AND SO I THINK WE ARE ALL SET- WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON BEING ABLE TO GIVE DIRECTLY PROVIDE. THE KINDS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WAS NEEDED. TO SUPPORT OF THE- POPULATION. I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THAT BACKGROUND OF HOW YOU. GOT TO THIS CONCLUSION AS I'M NOT THERE THE SECOND EXAMPLE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ALSO. OUT THERE AND THE NUMBER YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE LAST SAW THIS WAS CLOSER TO. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY FOR EXAMPLE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY RESOURCES WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- IN THIS. PART OF HORSERACING BOARD WITHIN THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WHICH IS TWICE THE AMOUNT FOR THIS OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION ITSELF- SO I WAS. PLEASED TO SEE THAT. YOU THERE IS AN INCREASE I STILL QUESTION WHY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS SO LOW- AT THIS MOMENT WHEN THE ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR AN OFFICE WITH MORE ROBUST- FOR THESE KIDS. FOR THIS YOUTH. I THINK AT THIS POINT. DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE PROVISIONS AND THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL CONTRACT DOLLARS WILL GIVE US THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS. OF THE OFFICE. K. WILL. WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DIGEST THIS ITEM WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT BUT I AM. THIS MY LOOK AT THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW A LITTLE PERPLEXED BY. BUT REPUBLICAN WE HAVE A SEVENTY FIVE BILLION SURPLUS THAT WE DIDN'T GET CLOSER TO THE RECOMMENDED NUMBER OUT THERE TWENTY MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I WE'RE LOOKING AT ITEM NUMBER. TWO I THINK WHEN WE AN INCH EXCUSE ME IF WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NO I SAY WE DID THE ENTIRE PANEL HERE TO GET A BREAK DOWN OF EXACTLY- WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO AND HOW YOU PLAN TO SERVICE. THESE YOUTH- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION THAT IS THAT THE NEW NUMBER- TO BE ABLE TO RUN A SPACE STATEWIDE PROGRAM. WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY USERS HOW MANY DIFFERENT AREAS- HOW MANY YOUTH FACILITIES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND HOW CAN YOU EFFECTIVELY OF NOT ONLY MONITOR FOR MAKE SURE THAT- THE DOLLARS SPENT AND WE'RE TALKING A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO DJJ- THAT IT'S THAT NOW IS IT SPENT WISELY. EXCUSE ME WHAT IS SPENT EFFECTIVELY- BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA COME BACK HERE EACH YEAR TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND WE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE BEST FIRST EFFORT AT GETTING THIS RIGHT NAY AT THE HOPEFULLY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING. FROM FROM- THIS PANEL FROM EVERYBODY HERE AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALMOST BIPARTISAN IN IN A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO THE BEST FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND YOUR EYES AND EARS. AT THE END OF THE DAY- WITH WITHOUT YOU- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LISTEN TO. REPORTS FROM- FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT IN THE SYSTEM- INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON- IN A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE BEST WAY WE DID CAN SUPPLY EVEN MORE SUPPORT- IT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE A CRIME IF. AFTER TWO YEARS YOU COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY NEEDIT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OR WE REALLY NEEDED OF MUCH MORE THAN THAT RENDON DAN WHAT WE GET HERE AND I KNOW ITS ONGOING COSTS AND- WE WHO CAME HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE. NO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPEND TOO MUCH AND ONGOING COST SO I CAN. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO WRAP UP RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND SO IF YOU CAN. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN TO US. THEY GIVE US SOME- THAT THEY LET US KNOW WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS MONEY AND BUT MOST IMPORTANT HOW EFFECTIVE. THIS WILL BE AN ENSURING THAT- THIS PROGRAMS WE TAKE IT DOWN. TO LOWER LOVERS- MOST EFFICIENT. CORRECT ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- FOR THE ACTUAL DELIVERY OF SERVICES THAT IS A FUNDING SOURCE THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND SO I CAN'T BINANCE MIGHT KNOW SOME OF THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT IN TERMS OF THAT THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO. PAY FOR THE NECESSARY SERVICES TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT BEING SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE THEM NOT- PRESENTED THEY CAN GET YOU KNOW FULLY INTEGRATED BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY THE OFFICE YOU WERE CERTAINLY CORRECT IN THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFICE TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS OF. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO COLLECT DATA AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL IN HOUSE RESEARCH CAPACITY. AS WELL AS SOME STAFF THAT WOULD HAVE. PROGRAM LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND BEST PRACTICES AROUND JUSTICE AND- THANK YOU IN SERVICE THAT TYPE PROGRAMS- BUT AGAIN- JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT CRITICS FOR THE FOR THE REALIGNED YOU- THAT THE RESOURCES TO. TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO THEM WHAT WOULD BE GOING THROUGH IT NEVER ANOTHER PROCESS- AND SO CERTAINLY- THAT'S A ROBUST FUNDING SOURCE- AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE FUNDS ARE ACCOMPLISHING GOOD OUTCOMES AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL BE REVIEWING PLANS AN ANNUAL BASIS ALSO. WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS AND POTENTIALLY FOR OUR CONSULTING CONTRACTS TO EXAMINE DATA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED PROGRAMS. SO I'M- NOW LI COMPUTERS AS TO WHY THIS DEPARTMENT DOES- OFF TO YOU THINK COMMUNITY RESTORATION SO MAYBE THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT MAY BE PART OF THE CONFUSION WE'RE NOT CERTAIN WHAT YOUR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT AND MAYBE START FROM THAT. OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M I'M I'M JUST CONFUSED I MEAN IF ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SHUFFLING PAPERS LIKE THE B. SEC WHICH I'M NOT EVEN SURE WE NEED DOWN THE WIRE WEEK CRAZINESS LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY AS I SEE BY. MY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE AISLE. LOOKING AT ME WITH HSI'S THROUGH A WIRE WE CREATING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. THAT DOESN'T HELP MOVE THIS ALONG. IN A SEPARATE WAY SO IT MAY BE THAT. IT WOULD REALLY BE GOOD TO TRY TO. TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS. IT THAT YOU DO. AND WHAT OUTCOMES. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT OUTCOMES ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET FROM THIS THIS GROUP AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY CONFUSING PART IS RIGHT NOW. OKAY YEAH WE KIND OF JUST JUMPED IN ZERO JUST GIVING YOU THE BASIC UPDATES ON HOW THE PCP IS DIFFERENT BUT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DELIVERABLES THAT THIS OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING INTO AND DOING SO WITH QUALITY IN DOING IT- BY COMING TO YOU TALK TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO IN ADDITION TO REVEALING PLANS WE ALSO HAVE ANNUAL AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO FOR EXAMPLE RECORDS ONLINE WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF WHAT INFORMATION WE'RE RECEIVING THROUGH YOUR ARMS PERSONS UNIT. WE ALSO WILL HAVE ANNUAL DATA REPORTS THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO SHARE BACK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS A SPECIFIC- ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REALIGNMENTS I BELIEVE THAT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- AND SO WE HOPE TO REALLY BE PARTNERS WITH YOU AND TO USE THAT DATA MUSCLE. TO COME AND TALK ABOUT HOW DATA CAN BE USED TO DRIVE POLICY- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SEE THE FOCUS OF OUR OTHER OFFICE BEING AND- WE ALSO HAVE A HEAD OF. THAT COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE STANDING UP AND WE ALSO- THAT COMMITTEE IS PART OF THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL. DOUBLE THAT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BUT LOOKING AT THE DATA IS. TO IMPROVE THE LOCAL LEVEL. OKAY TO. JUST MAYBE CAN HAVE A BIT A I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THIS HERE. BECAUSE KEEP SOUND ALIKE TO BE A C. C. AND IT'S IS NOT A GOOD THING RIGHT NOW FOR ANY ORGANIZATION TO COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. REPLICATING THE B. S. C. C. THIS IS WHAT THIS KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE AND SO MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU- IT IS MORE ABOUT. THAT SO LET'S. GIVE YOU A CALL MY OFFICE A CALL THE CHAIR. OF TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU WELL I THINK PART OF THE DISCONNECT IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW IS THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT THE SYSTEM ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND THE CONCERN. THAT I HAVE AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT MYSELF IS THAT IF WE JUST HAVE CREATED. THIS REALIGNMENT AS AS A FUNCTION TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND PUSHED RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAN THAN. WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY HEADED DOWN A PATH THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AND WHAT I THINK. THIS AGENCY IS CRITICAL FOR IS ENSURING. THAT IT WON'T MATTER WHERE. YOUTH IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH COUNTY OR WHICH REGION THAT HERE WILL BE CONSISTENT SET OF OUTCOMES AND THAT'S WHY THIS AGENCY IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE PROVIDING. THE REVIEW THE BEST PRACTICES THAT THE THINK TANK ENVIRONMENT. ULTIMATELY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND HELP TO COUNTIES AND REGIONS TO SERVE YOU BETTER. AND I STILL THINK OF THIS IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE. THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT. THE BREADTH OF THIS THROUGH THAT WE SHOULD BE SETTING UP. A OUR SYSTEM AGENCY SOMETHING THAT IS LOOKING OUT FOR ALL KIDS BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM OF WE'RE STYLING KIDS IN DEPENDENCY AND DELINQUENCY THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND THOSE ARE IN OTHER SITUATIONS REALLY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO AND NO NO SERVICES THAT THAT THEY CAN REAL. REALLY RELY ON AND WHAT I THINK WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TRIED TO DO WAS IS ARTICULATE TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IF WE HAD A STRONGER CENTRALIZED FUNCTION FOR ALL KIDS THAT PROMISE THE RIGHT RISK THAT WE COULD HAVE A STRONGER SYSTEM TO SERVE THE KIDS BECAUSE WHETHER THEY'RE HOMELESS OR THEIR INDEPENDENCY ORIENTAL IN QUINCY THESE ARE ALWAYS THE SAME KIDS OUT OF THE SAME COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE SAME FAMILIES OUT OF THE SAME SITUATIONS. COMPLICATED BECAUSE WERE DRIED OUT FEDERAL FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS BUT THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT AN AGENCY LIKE THIS REALLY COULD HELP SORT OUT AND FIGURE OUT. SO AS WE DEVELOP THIS. NEW MODEL OF. HAVING REALIGNED OUT OF THE COUNTIES AND HAVING BROUGHT A LOT OF THIS FUNCTION INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. CAPACITY THAT SHOULD LEAD US TO DIFFERENT OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO WITH THESE KIDS TO HELP THEM AND TO SERVE THEM. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO REMAIN THERE ARE SOME. SOME SIGNIFICANT STRIDES THAT. DJJ HAS MADE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SEX OFFENDER UNIT. AT HOW THAT GETS REPLICATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. I'M NOT REAL CLEAR ON AND I'M NOT SURE ANYBODY REALLY IS EITHER BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEVELOP THAT CAPACITY. WAR POTENTIALLY. KEEP SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT MANY KIDS IN FROM AN EFFICIENCY STANDPOINT I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS. AND THE BOTTOM LINE HAS TO BE HOW WE'RE SERVING KIDS. HOW WE'RE HELPING THEM SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN SO THAT THEY CAN. FIX WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND GET BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A PIECE OF IT HERE AND WE HAVE. ASKED FOR. MORE RESOURCES MORE POSITIONS. MORE FUNDING TO THIS AGENCY BECAUSE OF I THINK OUR VISION FOR WHAT YOU CAN BE FOR THESE KIDS AND THE CONSISTENCY THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE. REPRESENTING TH ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS REALLY GOING TO BE CRITICAL. TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. ROSS THE STATE THAT'S SORT OF I THINK YOU'RE HEARING SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY HERE BECAUSE- IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY. REALLY HAS AN ANSWER TO THAT YET AND UNFORTUNATELY. THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE STEPPING THROUGH AND LEARNING AS WE GO AND WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE KIDS. IN THE SYSTEM WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM NOW AND SOON TO BE IN THE SYSTEM. THAT THAT'S WHAT'S CRITICAL IT IS AND IF WE SET UP THE SYSTEM MORE AS WE EXPLORE IT. AND WE LEAVE KIDS BEHIND OR WERE NOT SERVING THEM THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ULTIMATELY THE TRAGEDY. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR AGENCY IS FUNDED. APPROPRIATELY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BROADER OVERSIGHT. THE CONNECTIONS TO HELP. TO ENSURE SUCCESS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND POTENTIALLY REGIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE NOT EVERY COUNTY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING THEM TO IMPLEMENT A WITH THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO. DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE KIDS THAT ARE IN THE- SO I THINK THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE DISCONNECT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT A LARGER SYSTEMS CHANGE. AND KIND OF PUSHING BACK ON THE ADMINISTRATION. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM LIKE THAT LEVEL OF SYSTEM CHANGES WHAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN. WELL I AM I KNOW. OF IS FIVE EIGHT. USING SORT OF THE COLLECTIVE WE HEAR. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS COME FROM THERE WERE SOME OF THE DISCONNECT COMES FROM SO FOR US FINDING A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE BIGGER PICTURE. IN MIND AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THESE AND HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SO WHAT IS THE REST OF THIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THEY'RE SENDING A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY IN A LOT OF RESOURCE. DATA LOCAL LEVEL. AND ENSURING THAT THOSE LOCAL LEVELS ARE PERFORMING TO A PARTICULAR STANDARD. IS THIS AGENCY. THAT'S WHAT'S ULTIMATELY KEY HERE M. AND THAT'S WE'RE GONNA BE TRACKING THAT'S WORKING TO BE LOOKING TO AND THERE'S REALLY A LOT AT STAKE HERE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR KIDS IF WE SET THIS UP CORRECTLY. AND IF WE DON'T IF WE JUST TRY TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY THEN WE WILL BE FAILING THOSE KIDS DOWN THE LINE. THAT'S THE SENSITIVITY THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE RIGHT SIZED AT THIS POINT. AND ARE WE MAKING THE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT CONTINUITY AND THAT HELPED. STATEWIDE SO THINK THAT'S WHERE IT COMES TO AN END I AM NOT COMPLETELY SURE AS TO HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MISPRISION ABOUT THIS ABOUT SOME OF MY CONCERNS OF IMPLEMENTATION. BOTH WITHIN THIS AGENCY AND- KIND OF BIGGER PICTURE WITH A LOT OF THE- THE SERVICES HAT I'M NOT SURE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN SETTLED ON. HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT PIECES OF IT AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT. A PIECE OF IT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE CAPACITY. TO BE THAT. OVER ARCHING. RESOURCE HELP. TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO KIDS ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE IF IT MATTERS WHAT COUNTY THEY'RE IN BUT WHAT REGION THERE IN FOR THEIR SUCCESS THEN THIS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN A SUCCESSFUL EXERCISE. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE OF COMMENTED MR STONE. COMMENTS. BUT THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD SAY I JUST I DIDN'T MENTION IT TODAY BUT WHEN WE WERE HERE LAST TIME- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE MANY DEPART FRIENDS WHO AT LEAST FRIENDS LIVE THANK YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY HAVE- SO I JUST WANT YOU TO HEAR THAT IT IS A PART OF OUR VISION AND OUR COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THOSE AT. ALL WHICH I THINK MIGHT BE HEADING OUT YEAH BUT IT'S THAT WE WOULD REALLY WANT TO DRAW THEM IN AND THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE SYSTEMS CHANGE FEES BECAUSE IT ALSO MEANS WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER- AS WELL IN THE WAY THAT WE- ARE WELL ON OUR PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT OUR COUNTIES. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT IN THAT WAY. JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT. OKAY WELL THERE'S NO FURTHER COMMENT AT YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO KAMALA FOR TO ENGAGE IN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. UNDER THAT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE AS WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE WE HAVE. A SYSTEM THAT'S EQUITABLE NO MATTER WHAT COUNTY WHERE ANYTHING THAT BOTH THE PART OF MR STONE'S. CONCERNS A SYSTEM THAT. TRULY HELP OUR YOUTH MEET THEIR POTENTIAL. OUT THERE- AND HELPS HELPS THEM I THINK LEASE TERMS AND YOU SEE YOURSELF. TRAUMA INFORMED AND WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN AND IF SO I THINK WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY START TO DELVE INTO THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST CHECKING OFF A BOX THAT MAKES US FEEL GOOD. WELL WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE HERE BOTH WHAT THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT ALSO WITH. THE SURPLUS FOR THE BUDGET THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW TO DO SOME PROPER INVESTMENTS EARLY ON FOR THE SUCCESS OF. THE PROGRAM WHICH IS REALLY FOR THE SUCCESS OF ALL OF THESE KIDS WITH THIS WELL WE I THINK HAVE A COMMON GOAL WITH THAT SO. I WILL MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ITEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ON THAT- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THAT. CAN YOU GIVE. ME NUMBERS KEVIN CLARK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEY WERE DISCUSSING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX NINETY NINE WHICH REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF UNSAFE FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS. THAT ARE PURCHASED PURSUANT HE STOPPED THE SEARCH ENGINES. AND ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION TO PERSONS WHO POSSESS OR MAINTAINING. AND GUNS AND GUNS. WE ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE YOU CAN FOR NOW HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IT REACHES A MAXIMUM OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THEN DROPS TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN ONGOING. THE MAJORITY OF RESOURCES COVER ONE TIMES IT RELATED COSTS AS WELL AS THE OLDER PRESENTED WAS THERE NEEDED. TO AUDIT UNSAFE FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS RECORDS THAT FIREARMS DEALERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES STATEWIDE. I'M JOINED WITH COLLEAGUES FROM THE APARTMENT BY APARTMENT JUSTICE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- ON THIS ITEM WE ARE RECOMMENDING MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL TO SHIFT A PORTION OF THE COSTS TO THE DEALERS RECORD OF JAIL SHUFFLE CAP ALSO KNOWN AS ROAST AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE PROPOSED. SORRY THE LEGISLATION- HERE SPECIFICALLY AMENDED STATE LAW TO ALLOW FOR CERTAIN COSTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION TO BE COVERED BY THE FIRE V. REVENUE WHICH DEPOSIT INTO THE ACCOUNT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THE SENATE ONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. WE HAVE. FOUR L. NUMBER TWO YES SORRY LOS HAVE AB FIFTEEN L. SIX. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE ART. WE ARE REFORMING FRANCE AGAIN SO AB FIFTEEN OH SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS THAT RESULT IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED CIVILIAN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED THIRTEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND THREE INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS AND LEGAL RESOURCES AND ALSO GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. AND THE NEIGHBOR VISION IN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE MILLION OR ONE OF THE TIONAL TEAM. TO BE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN REGION WELL AS THE VICTIM SUPPORT SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF THOSE KILLED IN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. YOU ALSO KNOW THAT WE CAN CLEAR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEIR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IF NECESSARY. AND AFTER- BY TO JOIN LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- AGAIN WE'RE JOINED WITH COLLEAGUES FROM DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY AVAILABLE CREDIT ANALYST OFFICE- DO YOU RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AS THE BUDGET ALREADY INCLUDES AN EXISTING PROCESS LAID OUT IN. ITEM NINETY EIGHT FORGET THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR. LATED AND NECESSARY EXPENSES- AND SOAK TAKING THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER STATUTORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED. THE PROGRAMS HIGHEST OURSELVES- WE KNOW ABOUT THE COPY OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL EARLIER THIS MORNING AND SO ARE STILL ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PARTICULAR DETAILS AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO ON THE FIFTEEN OH SIX ITEM IF WE ALREADY HAVE A PRODUCT. AND PLAYS- AND IT ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS JOB AND HAVE WILL RECITE LIKE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WE SHOULD BE INCREASED OR DECREASED RESOURCES NOW. KEVIN ARE YOU MUTED. YEAH THANK YOU SOME OF THAT ARE YOU SPEAKING TO WHEN YOU DISCOVER ABOUT THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS. YES BUT YES SIR WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE- DEFINITELY GOT THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS IN THE TURNING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ARE BORN ACTOR LEGISLATION LIKE EVEN IF IT'S NO SIX THERE WERE JUST NOT A FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE APPROACH SUGGESTED BY ELIO- SPECIFICALLY THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS IS NOT A SURE FIRE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS ANY AND ALL UNANTICIPATED COSTS- THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS IS ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. MEANING THAT DOJ IS NOT GUARANTEED THEY HAVE THEIR. COSTS COVERED BY THE WILL OF FUNDING. AND ALSO SECOND NINE FOUR PROCESS. IS REALLY PER COSTS THAT ARE AN UNANTICIPATED. WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR UPON THIS SENSE- GIVE ME KNOWLEDGE OF IT MAY BE A POSSIBILITY. WHAT FUTURE COSTS. FINALLY THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY FULL IS REALLY CAPITANI NINE FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT MAY BE INSUFFICIENT. FOR THE NEEDS OF YOUR JACK. SO YOU'RE SAYING THEY ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE A HIGHER COST. WELL MATTERS HERE WE GO THE WE HAVE PROPOSED ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD ALLOW PARENTS TO PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT SHOULD ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD- ALL RIGHTS. IT JUST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING THIS- NOT DOING ITS JOB AND JUST TRUST. TRUST TRUST IN US AND- AND TO THINK THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT TRUST IS HAS YET BUT- AND THEN NUMBER TWO I DON'T THINK THAT ARE VOTERS IT IS SENT TO. GIVE UP OUR POWER LIKE THAT. AND SO I DO RECOMMEND YOU GUYS- RECONSIDER YOUR APPROACH HERE. TWENTY MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON. OKAY.

CRIME ACT- PRESERVATION PROPOSES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CALAVERAS IS- TO SUPPLEMENT FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM SERVICES PROGRAMS- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHILE THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS DECREASING- THIS VICTIMS VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT- SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WILL SUPPORT RAPE CRISIS PROGRAMS MUST BE BALANCED. VICTIM WITNESS PROGRAMS AND CHILD ADVOCACY CENTERS- THIS ONE TIME AUGMENTATION ALLOW. EXISTING PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE WHILE BUILDING CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE INCREASED NEED- AND WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- LOOKS THAT- EFFORTS TO ATTEMPTTO FIX THE- VOCA FUNDING LEVELS- WITH BATS- IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT AND I KNOW WE HAVE TWO OTHER ISSUES THAT DIRECTOR- OF. OF CALLOW S. WILL BE TAKING ON BUT WE'LL WE'LL PAUSE THERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THE L. A. L. HAVE ANY COMMENTS. SORT OF BORED WITH THE L. A. O. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FIRST ISSUES COVERED BY MR DUMPING WE ONLY HAVE COMMENTS ON THE LAST ONE THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT SUPPLEMENTAL READING OR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY EFFORTS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THROUGH THE FOCUSED EXTRACTION COULD. RESPECTFUL FUNDING THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY IF THE LEGISLATURE GOAL AND APPROVING THIS FUNDING IS TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS IT COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING. ANY PLANS NOT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS TO REPORT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THANK YOU AYE I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER THIS ANYONE HAVE ANY UPDATES OF HOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE FOR THE FUNDING TIED TO BOCA. MADAM CHAIR I CAN CERTAINLY SEE IF WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU AND- AND GET SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU AND- YOU INVESTMENT. I WOULD DEFINITELY APPRECIATE pARE FOCUSING AND THE MAY REVISE. AND LOOK AT THE SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO. AT A MINIMUM MAINTAIN THE LEVEL BUT AS WE KNOW THROUGH COVERT- THE. RATE HAS BEEN INCREASING SINCE SO WE MIGHT ICING. ALL I WOULD APPRECIATE CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT WE CONSIDERING CASE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET DONE. AND THEN FINALLY THE SOUTH OF THE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- IT'S ENOUGH OF A TO CLOSE THE GAP. I THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SEEN OUT THERE. AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE THIS LOOK AT THIS. A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AND NUANCE US AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS MADE IT INTO THE MAY. REVERSE AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER- THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING- THE VICTIM OF THE MIX OF VIOLENCE AND NOT HAVING THE SUPPORT OUT THERE TO. GIVE YOU THE SPACE TO TAKE THE STEPS YOU NEED FOR YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY OUT THERE AND SO. I THINK WHAT THE SURPLUS WE HAVE WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE. TO SUPPORT THE VICTIMS AND FAMILIES IN THE PROPER WAY. AND ANYONE COMMITTEE HEARD THIS ITEM. OKAY I KNOW THERE ARE TWO OTHER- ISSUES FOR CALLAWAY ASSET BELIEVE- DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI IS- GOING TO BE- DISCUSSING THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELL GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK RTG DIRECTOR OF CALLOW YES. CALIFORNIA EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ARE MORE FREQUENT COMPLICATED AND INVOLVING MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND MANY AT THE SAME TIME. WE'VE EXPERIENCE AT ALL WILDFIRE EARTHQUAKE FLOOD AND FLASH FLOODS MUDFLOWS TSUNAMIS DROUGHTS HAS MASS POWER OUTAGES AND SECURITY THREATS. AND WE LIKE YOU HAVE WITNESSED TOO MANY TIMES THE DEVASTATION OF A COMMUNITY HAVE BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS. STRUCTURAL AND FINANCIAL RECOVERIES FOR COMMUNITIES ARE LONG AND CHALLENGING PARTICULARLY FOR THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES OF OUR STATE. WE NEED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF DISASTER REBUILD DISASTER REBUILD. SO TO STRENGTHEN AND BETTER PREPARE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. AIR CALIFORNIA BUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES- CALIFORNIA MAXIMIZES THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT NGOS CBO'S FBOS AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO RECOGNIZE AND CENTER DRIES PRIORITIZATION AND RESPIRE ORGANIZATION ACTION AND HELP ADDRESS CURRENT BARRIERS FOR LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IT'S FUNNY WHICH SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ALL HAZARDS VULNERABILITIES. BUILD RESILIENCY AND PROTECT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES BEFORE DISASTER WITH THE SUPPORT OF STATE GOVERNMENT. REMEMBER TARGET DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PROMOTING THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY AND BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR STATEWIDE RESILIENCY AND EDUCATION TO ALL HAZARDS THE PARTNERSHIP ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY HARDING PROGRAMS- CALIFORNIA ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING TO HELP RELIEVE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THEIR SHARE OF COSTS REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION PROJECTS UNDER THE FEDERAL HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM A BARRIER FOR MANY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY SMALLER DISADVANTAGED ONCE. AS A FIRST RESPONDER I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN AND WALK THROUGH TOO MANY COMMUNITIES AFTER THEY'VE BEEN LEVELED BY DISASTERS. LIVES WERE FOREVER CHANGED BY THESE EVENTS. WE KNOW THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BUT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AT SUPPORTING IN PREPARING OUR COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING THAT LEVEL OF RESILIENCY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SORT OF BORED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARM. WELL WE ARE OFFICE WOULD DEFINITELY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT COMMUNITY HARDENING ACTIVITIES CAN'T ACHIEVE NOTABLE BENEFITS- THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. POSTED BY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED INCLUDING HOW FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITISED BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAZARDS SUCH AS WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS- FUNDS WOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN OFFSETTING FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE OFFSET HOW DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND HOW FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITISED BETWEEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO APPROVE THIS FINDING IT COULD OUR STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES FOR EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT THESE BONDS TRADE ROUTES A SPECIFIC TYPE OF HAZARD- HAZARDS SUCH AS WILDFIRES YOU CAN DOSO BY ADOPTING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE OR BUDGET TRAILER. LEGISLATION LEGISLATION. I THANK YOU- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES- IN ADDITION TO MYSELF I HAVE A NINE. SMALL CITIES THAT HAVE REALLY LIMITED BUDGETS AND SO. EVEN AT THAT THEM TO MEET THAT THAT MATCH. OUT THERE IF THEY DO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A RANGE THAT LOCAL. NOT THAT LOCAL I. SHARE PART UP TO A 100% AND- I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE TALKINGABOUT THIS ADVANTAGE IN TRYING TO PRIORITIZE. THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO- ARE OFTEN AFFECTED THE MOST AND HAVE THE LEAST TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE AND GET THROUGH. THESE MOMENTS I DO HE'D- THE L. ALES. WARNING IN A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE THAT WE LOOK A LITTLE MORE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE DISADVANTAGED HOW TO REPAIR TIES WITHIN THEIR- WHEN WE SAY UP TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. I WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE AND WHAT IS THAT SKILL LOOK LIKE. TO MEET THOSE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN AN EQUITABLE WAY AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS DETAILS TODAY ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. AND IF NOT- AS THE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS ON. MADAM CHAIR WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS- WITH LEGISLATORS AS WE PROCEED THROUGH- LEGISLATIVE SLAM IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. MISS VIOLADAS. THANK YOU AND- AGAIN TO BOTH- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA- FOR YOUR- PRESENTATIONS I DO I WOULD LIKE CLARITY IS WELL ON THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR- IS FOR MORE FUNDING FOR PS PS- MONIES BECAUSE OUR CITIES OR OUR TRIBES ARE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT ARE TRYING TO MITIGATE WILDFIRES- AND- TRYING TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SERVICE THEIR COMMUNITIES- ARE OUT OF POWER WHEN PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS OCCUR AND THOSE ARE HAPPENING MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY- AND THEN WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THERE WILL ALSO BE- SOME ROLLING BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER WITH THE- DRYNESS AND HEAT THAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHETHER IT WAS LAST YEAR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR- THE PREVIOUS YEAR FIFTY MILLION- IT WASN'T ENOUGH. NUMBER CITIES THAT THE NEED FAR EXCEEDED THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO CAN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TELL ME WHAT ARE CITIES- WHO ARE LOOKING FOR RESOURCES IN THE FORM OF GRANTS FOR PS PS EVENTS INCLUDING BUYING BACK UP GENERATORS- OUR BATTERY PACKS- COULD THEY REQUEST SUPPORT AND RESOURCES OR OR WOULD THERE. BE GRANTED BILLABLE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM FOR THAT. I'LL START A MINUTE AND THEN I'LL PASS IT ON- TO CALAVERAS MY UNDERSTANDING IT IS THIS IS MORE HARDENING OF INFRASTRUCTURE- TO MITIGATE AGAINST FUTURE FLOODS FIRES EARTHQUAKES- BUT- I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT THAT- THAT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE DIRECTLY- INCORPORATED AND INTO THE- THOUGH THOUGH THERE THERE MAY BE SOME SEEM TANGENTIAL BETTER BENEFITS- I'M NOT SURE- YES HAS ANYTHING TO ADD ON TO THAT. AND THANKS SSEMBLY MEMBER- FOR THE QUESTION THIS IS MARK RTG. I THINK THE ANSWER ON THIS IS THAT- THROUGH ABOUT ABOUT- PREPARE CALIFORNIA'S ISSUE THAT IF YOU IT'S REALLY COMMUNITIES LOOKING AT. THERE RISKS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD OFTEN AT ALL HAZARDS STANDPOINT- EVERY PART OF THE STATE HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT RISKS SIGNATURE. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VULNERABILITY LEVELS AND IN SOME AREAS- POWER COULD BE OUT. THERE DRIVING FOR PROFITABILITY IN SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S NOT A LOT THAT'S WHY THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS REALLY NOT DESIGNED TO BE ONE HAZARD AND FOCUS ON ONE HAZARD BUT TO LOOK AT A BROAD. OFF MORE- YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE WAY BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS WE WOULD SAY IN THIS INITIATIVE BACK INSTEAD OF DOING A ONE OFF BY EIGHT EIGHTY UP- A GENERATOR WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT WE WOULD WORK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT BUT DISTRICT TO DETERMINE WHERE THE PHONE ABILITY IS IF IT'S IN POWER THEN WE WOULD LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND FUNDS WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN BE PRIORITY SETTING UP ACT COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY. GROUP MADE UP OF ALL THE FOLKS I MENTIONED BEFORE TO ADDRESS THE POWER NEEDS- THAT WAY IT COULD BE A GENERATOR BUT HAS THAT GENERATOR FIT INTO THE LARGER- I NEED SHOULD HAVE A FIELDING RESILIENCY IN THE COMMUNITY OVERALL. SO THEN YOU CAN MAXIMIZE THE EFFORT ABOUT ONE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OR ONE LOCAL COMMUNITY BY BUILDING AUTOMATION BROADER SET OF CAPABILITIES. WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION. SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE. YEAH YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE YOU KNOW IT'S A PART OF THE EFFORT THERE THEY'RE SOME OF THE MONEY COULD USED- BUT AGAIN IT WOULD BE IN IN THE APPROACH JUST A ONE OFF. RIGHT TO WORK THE- LEGISLATIVE AND OFFICE ONLY THING I'M GOING TO JUMP INTO ACT IS JUSTICE REITERATE THE MARKET REMARKS I MADE BEFORE IS THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO REASON THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULDN'T STRUCTURE THIS PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT CERTAIN HAZARDS WERE ADDRESSED- SO AND WE ARE ENCOURAGED THE LEGISLATURE TO. ENSURE THAT ITS PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN WHATEVER THEY ALSO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM AS- THANK YOU. MISTER DANCER RIGHT AND I JUST. ON THE DISASTER COST TRACKING AND RECOVERY UNIT- AND- I DON'T KNOW IF WE GOT THAT PART ABOUT MODERNIZING THE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYTICS I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AS SOMEONE. THEY USED TO. DO THIS COLLECTED DATA TO GET RECOVERY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AND WE DID IT WITH PAPER. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP THAT WEIGHT ROOMS AND ROOMS FULL OF PAPER- TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY A RECOVERY- AND I RAN THAT UNIT. AND IT DAY UNIT MORE THAN PAY FOR THEMSELVES OF OVER THE LONG RUN AND SO- I WOULD LIKE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH- YES AND- I COULD COSTLY HERE ABOUT SMALL CITIES AND OTHER PLACES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO- TOOK TOMATOES CORRECTIVE TO MAINTAIN OF RECORDS OR HAVE STAFF TO COLLECT THOSE RECORDS. AND TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY GET REIMBURSED- OR EVEN TO COME UP WITH FUNDS TO DO THE DATA COLLECTION SO. I MAY BE AHEAD OF THE GAME BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU YOU ARE BEING A GREAT STATE AND- AND JUST A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THE GAME WITH THE LATEST NEXT ITEM- AND SO I WILL HAVE THEM PERCENT ON THAT AND THEN WE COULD ASK YOUR QUESTION AGAIN IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THANK HELLO WE COULD BEGIN- ISSUE SEVEN STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES. OKAY COME BACK OVER TO ME AGAIN THE TARGET MARKET RTG BOB. SO GIVEN THAT THAT THAT THE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND COMPLICATED IN CALIFORNIA BUT MAYBE VISION INCLUDES SIXTY POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN POSITION TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY CAPABILITIES. THIS IS THE BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES THIS INITIATIVE DOES THE FOLLOWING. IT ESTABLISHES A PERMANENT INCIDENT SUPPORT TEAM AS A PART OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND. AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE- FOR CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND LESSEN OUR CURRENT REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ARE RE DIRECTED STAFF TO DO SO. THE CURRENT OPERATION THAT WE HAVE IN THAT WE'VE BEEN USING IS REALLY OLD SCHOOL AND NOT SUSTAINABLE. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A NEW OFFICE OF EQUITY AND CAL WE ASKED TO STRENGTHEN OUR- CONNECTIONS WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND FURTHER. ELEVATE EQUITY AS A CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE ORGANIZATION. IT ALSO PROVIDES PERMANENT RESOURCES FOR THE LEAST THOSE PROGRAM AND EXPANDS ITS FOCUS TO INCLUDE RESPONSIVE RECOVERY PROGRAMS THE BETTER BILL THEN SERVICE TO DISASTER SURVIVORS AND COMMUNITIES. EVERY PLACE IS ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS THAT THAT LEVERAGES INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S CAPABILITIES- TECHNOLOGY AND STRENGTH IN DATA ANALYTICS AS DISASTERS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON PEOPLE AND PROPERTY HAVE INCREASED TIMELY DATA AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS ARE EVER MORE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT DATA INFORMED DECISIONS. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A NEW COST RECOVERY UNIT HELLO YES TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL EMERGENCY AND DISASTER DOLLARS PROVIDED CALIFORNIA. AS THE US I REMEMBER SORRY JUST MENTIONED AS THE STATE'S LEAD AGENCY FOR FEMA FEDERAL DOLLARS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS WOULD. HAVE RESULTED IN BILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED THE STATE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS COST RECOVERY THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING BACK IN TO BE ABLE TO HELP- HELP BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HE STATE AND FINALLY THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION- HUNDRED FIFTY POINT SEVEN OF THAT. BEING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE PERMANENT FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL LONG TERM COST RECOVERY POSITIONS. IT WOULD BE BETTER SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE ACCELERATING ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HELP GET COMMUNITIES BACK ON THEIR FEET AND RECOUP ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS FOR THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MAXIMIZE BOTH OUR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND HAZARD. HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU HAPPENED AFTER QUESTIONS. GEN JOHN THIRTY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. JUST UP JUST HOW THE- HOW DO YOU PLAN TO USE THE DISASTER COST TRACKING A RECOVERY UNIT AND HOW I SEE FOURTEEN POSITIONS BUT HOW SPECIFICALLY DO YOU PLAN TO- AND HOW ROBUST WILL IT BE AS FAR AS OUR RECOVERY FOR GETTING FEDERAL FUNDS BECAUSE YOU MENTION. THAT COULD RESULT IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING BACK DOWN TO THE STATE BUT HOW CAN WE ALSO MAKE SURE IT GOES DOWN TO LOOK MEANS IT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I REMEMBER- SO ONE OF THE ISSUES IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE EVER INCREASING. NUMBER OF DISASTERS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE DISASTERS- YES AS I'VE BECOME MORE AND MORE ENGAGED OUT ASSISTING PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BOB EVEN EVEN BOTHER RESPONSE OPERATIONS ARE GOING ON WE'RE ALREADY BEGINNING THAT PROCESS OF SETTING UP. THE LONG TERM RECOVERY OPERATIONS EVER FINDING THAT WERE HAVING TO ENGAGE. OVER THE LONG TERM THE LIFE OF THE RECOVERY- CYCLE. ENGAGE WITH THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO KEEP THEM- ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK THROUGH ITS SYSTEM IN MAXIMIZING EVERY DOLLAR. AND THOSE DOLLARS COULD COME FROM FEEDBACK THEY COULD COME FROM OUTSIDE- BABY NO THEY THERE THEY COULD BECOME FROM USDA. DEPENDING ON WHEREVER THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE. WE REALLY WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE RECOVERY BILLS AND GET THEM DOWN INTO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT BUT TO UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS EFFECTIVELY THAT LONG TERM RECOVERY PLAN NEEDS TO BE ON THE FRONT END OF THE RECOVERY PROCESS. AND THIS IS WHERE- YES REALLY PROVIDES THAT. TECHNICAL DATA NOT LET ME BE CLEAR THAT. THAT THAT YOU KNO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ARE IT PROVIDES- HUNDRED FOUR POSITIONS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THAT EXPIRED JUNE THIRTIETH AND WE'RE AT WORK WE WORK WE'RE REQUESTING THAT. THEY MAKE THOSE PERMANENT AND ALSO AT A HUNDRED TEN NEW POSITIONS. INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THAT SIX TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NOW WE'VE HAD FIFTY SEVEN. ADDITIONAL STATE AND FEDERAL DISASTERS JUST IN THAT IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME JUST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT- WE'VE GOT THOUGHT THAT DISASTERS THAT TYPICALLY TAKE ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN YEARS OF SOME OF THE MORE COMPLICATED ONES. THE COMPLETELY REBUILT THE COMMUNITY AND THEN WE'VE GOT ALL THESE NEW ONES THAT. THAT SORT OF STACK RACK AND STACK ON TOP OF. EACH OTHER THEY WERE HAVING TO DEAL WITH WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY REACHED. BUT AROUND BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. WE SUPPORT THOSE LOW GOVERNMENTS TO THE GREAT EXTENT. THE MAXIMUM EVERY BIT OF COST RECOVERY. IT WILL JUST MAKE SURE WE CAN QUANTIFY BECAUSE FOR EVERY PERSON YOU HIGHER. UP I DON'T WANNA MAKE IT. LOOKED LIKE JUST STRAIGHT DOLLARS BUT FIERCELY FOR EVERY PERSON YOU HIRE THEY BRING BACK. X. AMOUNT OF DAY PAY FOR THEMSELVES IN IN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SO IF WE CAN QUANTIFY THAT I THINK WE YOU WOULD HAVE ANY. PROBLEMS THAT ONLY HAVING US- RE AUTHORIZED OF POSITIONS BUT ALSO MAKING A PERMIT BECAUSE THE DATE. THEY EASE THE GENERAL FUND AND SO WHEN A DISASTER HAPPENS WE'RE NOT TAKING THE BIGGEST HIT ON THE GENERAL FUND- AS WE WOULD NORMALLY DO. YES SIR I COULD CURRENT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT FAT BY DETAIL FOR YOU. THANK YOU THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WHO WILL MOVE ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE SORT OF OUR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE DECADES- IF THERE'S TIME OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE SOME REMARKS ON THIS IS AN ONLINE. COOPER THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TIME TO JUMP IN AHEAD OF TIME. HELLO THE ONLY GRAMMY I EXPECT TO GET A JUMP IN SO I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU. NO PROBLEM NO PROBLEM. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A PERMANENT STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TEAM IN PRINCIPLE WE FIND. THE IDEA OF A DEDICATED TEAM REASONABLE HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT- YES IS NOT PROVIDED DATA ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH STAFF ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR NORMAL WORK LOAD. I DO TOO THE STOCK ACTIVATIONS WHICH IS THE PRIMARY REASON WHY HE'S ADDITIONAL STAFF ARE BEING REQUESTED. I SUCH IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE AMOUNT F RESOURCES PROPOSED OR APPROPRIATE. WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFICE OF EQUITY WE FIND A PROPOSAL REASONABLE AND RECOMMEND APPROVAL- WHEN IT COMES TO THE- WE STILL SEE GRANT PROGRAM- WE FIND THE PROGRAM PROMISING. BUT SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS MENTIONED BEFORE THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT HOW IT WOULD OPERATE SUCH AS WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE SUPPORTED. HOW FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITISED BETWEEN SUPPORTED SERVICES. AGAIN HELLO YES WHAT IDENTIFIED COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICE AND HOW OR WHAT- YES WOULD PRIORITIZE BETWEEN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND WHETHER OUTCOME DATA WOULD BE COLLECTED AND USED. TO INFORM FUTURE GRANT AWARDS. WHEN COMES TO THE- DISASTER- COSTS TRACKING AND RECOVERY UNIT WELL AS THE- TO MODERN- YES. SYSTEMS FIND THAT THESE ARE A REASONABLE PROPOSALS AND RECOMMEND THEIR APPROVAL AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T PROVE ON. IT WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MONTHLY REPORTS ON STATE EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO TO IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. OVER EMERGENCY SERVICES AND FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE LONG TERM RECOVERY THE PROPOSAL ENDING FOR LONG TERM RECOVERY TEAMS WE ALSO FIND THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE. AND DON'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- BUT THAT WE WILL. WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER FIVE WE'RE GOING TO COVER THE FIRST FIVE ITEMS AT TOGETHER AND AT THE END OF THE FIFTH ITEM I WILL. GO AHEAD AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE REFERRED THAT ALLAH WILL JUMP IN APPROPRIATELY. THANK YOU.

CHIEF JUSTICE REPLIES THE TEMPORARIES AND JUDGES PROGRAM TO ALLOW COURTS TO REQUEST JUDGES TO FACILITATE READINESS CONFERENCE PROGRAMS WHICH ALLOW THE PARTIES IN THE CASE THE GATHERED A SEPARATE. CONFERENCE TO EXPEDITE THE ADJUDICATION OF THESE CASES WELL THE CHIEF JUSTICE PROVIDES TEMPORARY JUDGES TO COURTS THAT ARE IN FOR THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NOT ALL COURTS HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE STAFF TO SUPPORT THESE JUDGES. THIS IS MADE SOME COURTS RELUCTANT TO OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM THIS FUNDING WOULD MEAN THAT FINANCIAL DOCUMENT TO FURTHER PROMOTE THIS PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW THE TRANSPORTS TO ADDRESS. A BACKLOG WITH THE PROCESSING OF CRIMINAL CASES THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME WOULD ENABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE REMOVED THE TEMPORARY SIDE JUDGES PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE COURTS TO SUPPORT ALL ASPECTS FOR THE READY MIX. CONFERENCE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL. THE FOURTEENTH THE- ISSUE ON PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. THE MAYOR THIS INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REQUEST UP TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASE BACKLOGS IN THE EVENT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES REQUIRED HOW DID YOU. THE COUNCIL TO SUBMIT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES IN THIS WOULD REQUIRE A SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATING NOTIFICATION OF VALLEY I WAS RECOMMENDED TO REJECTED THIS LANGUAGE IN A STATE OF THIS FUNDING COULD BE REQUESTED THROUGH THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY ON ANTICIPATED COUGH REQUEST PROCESS HOWEVER WE'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS GIVEN THERE'S ONLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM IN THE GENERAL FUND. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE COST TO BE UNANTICIPATED I'M BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T THERE WE ARE PLANNING FOR THEM TO OCCUR WITH THIS TRADITIONALLY SO THEREFORE WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY PROCESS TO BE USED IN LIEU IT'S PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN REGARD TO THE ALIENS RECOMMENDATION OF LIMITING THE USE OF THIS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CASE TYPES ARE JUST LIKE GOING OUT THAT ACROSS THE FIFTY EIGHT. REPORTS OF BACKLOGS CAN VARY BY CASE TYPE IN RESTRICTIONS TO THE FUNDING COULD INHIBIT EACH RESPECTIVE COURTS IS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THEIR BACKLOGS. THANK YOU. I NEED ONLY WITH A- ALLEN OFFICE I MR MY- MENTION. AND WE ARE. REJECTING THE PROVISION LANGUAGE THERE IS AN EXISTING PROCESS. FOR A STATE PROGRAMS REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR AN ANTICIPATED THAT AND NECESSARY- EXPENSES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IN INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING THE LANGUAGE WE DO RECOMMEND. AMENDING THE LANGUAGE TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS INTO PARTICULAR WAYS. THE FIRST JUST TO MODIFY THE LANGUAGE FOR HOW THE FUNDING MAY BE USED AND SO THIS CAN INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE LIMITING USE TO CERTAIN CASE TYPES. OR TO A STATE WIDE TARGETED EFFORTS SUCH AS THE EARLY DISPOSITION PROGRAM THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED- THE SECOND WAY IS TO. MODIFY THE LANGUAGE TO REFLECT WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE PROVIDED TO JUSTIFY THE REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN GETTING INFORMATION. IN TERMS OF WHAT EFFORTS- THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG AND KIND OF HOW THEY PLAN ON USING THE FUNDING. AND SO COLLECTIVELY THESE WHAT HELP THE LEGISLATURE MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISION MAKING AT. HOW TO MAKE A- DECISIONS AS THEY WERE REVIEWING REQUESTS FOR THE FUNDING THANK YOU. FOR I WILL DISCUSS THE LEGAL AID FOR RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS ISSUE. THE COMMISSION ALSO INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION GROWN A LOT CORONAVIRUS FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDED TELL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FOR NONPROFIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AVOID EVICTION WERE FORECLOSURE THIS FUNDING WILL SUPPORT GRANTS TO THE STATE PARK OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE SERVICE PROJECTS IN SUPPORT. OFFERED PEOPLE SERVICES STUFF AND. TAKING HOMEOWNERS THANK YOU. THE L. A. R. HAS NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE NEXT ISSUE IS INCREASING REIMBURSEMENT ACCORDINGLY SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AUGMENTED THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT WHICH INCREASES THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THE EATEN FIFTY EIGHT PROGRAM A CHILD SUPPORT COMMISSION FAMILY OFFICE OKAY- PROGRAM. THIS MEANS THIS MEANS THE NEAR VISION WOULD INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THIRTY FIVE FIVE MILLION TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASE VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS THE REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY. INCREASES TECHNICAL IN NATURE. DALY I HAD A CONCERN ON THIS PROPOSAL. WE DETERMINE WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MINISTER TODAY STATEWIDE INITIATIVE TO REDUCE TRAVEL CONCERN AT THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT TWENTY TWO DECLINING TO SEVENTY MILLION ON GOING SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION AND PROPERTY OR PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES. TO PROMOTE THIS WEEK FISHING FAIR AND TIMELY PRE TRIAL RELEASE INDIVIDUALS BOOKED INTO JAIL AT THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY CONTAINS TWO COMPONENTS THE FIRST EXPAND THE PRE TRIAL PILOT PROGRAM ORIGINALLY FUNDED WITH ONE TIME RESOURCES AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AFTER BY PROVIDING FUNDS TO EACH OF THE FORTY MONTHS HERE WHAT'S- IT NOT RECEIVE FUNDING AS PART OF THAT. PROGRAM AT THE SECOND ONE IS THE ONGOING RESOURCES AND THIS WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ALL FIFTY AIRPORTS IN CALIFORNIA- WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT JUDICIAL OFFICERS MAKING PRE TRIAL RELEASE DECISIONS THAT MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO OUR- CLOSING AT LEAST A RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS ON THE DEFENDANT'S BY IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE MONITORING PRACTICES. IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES. THANK YOU. I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A. WE DO FIND THIS MERITS CAN AS IT PROVIDE RELIEF TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO HAV- WHO MIGHT HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING BAIL AND ALSO GIVEN A RECENT CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING THAT COULD INCREASE THE NEED FOR PRE TRIAL SERVICES- HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MODIFYING THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AND FIVE WEIGHTS- WAS THE FIRST IN THE FUNDING IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE ALLOCATED BASED ON EACH COUNTY SHARE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDING Ë TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR USING ALTERNATIVE OR ADDITIONAL METRICS SUCH AS CRIMINAL FILINGS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING MORE CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH THE POTENTIAL WORKLOAD THAT EACH CUNTY IN COURT WOULD BE FACING THE SECOND MODIFICATION IS TO REQUIRE DETAILED ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE EXPENDITURE OF THE USE OF THE DOLLARS AND KEY OUTCOME DATA SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AND- YOU KNOW HOW MANY AND HOW THEY WERE SERVED FOR EXAMPLE. THROUGH THE PERIOD PREECE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS USED ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFECTIVELY THE THIRD MODIFICATION IT IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFIED THE INTENT TO MODIFY THE ALLOCATION FORMULA IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR BASED ON ADDITIONAL DATA I'M SUCH AS USING THE PERCENT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RELEASED PRETRIAL RELATIVE TO THE FINDINGS- AS WELL AS THE FIRST REQUIRED ANNUAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL EVALUATION OF PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES AND SO THE EXISTING LANGUAGE REQUIRES THAT AS OF- JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD BE SUBMITTING- EVALUATING PRETRIAL PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT TIES TO. THE FOURTH MODIFICATION TO LANGUAGE IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROVIDING COURTS WITH FLEXIBILITY TO CONTRACT WITH THE ENTITY THAT IS THE BEST. SUITED TO PRE TRIAL SERVICES THAN JUST. PROBATION WHICH IS HOW THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN- AS LONG AS THE ENTITY DOESN'T HAVE ARREST RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THE FINAL MODIFICATION IS THAT WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF RACE AND OTHER FACTORS ON RELEASED DECISIONS. TO HELP INFORM WHETHER FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA IS NEEDED. THANK YOU. JUST MADE ANOTHER ARE GONNA FIND IT AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO RESPOND TO. A RECORD. IBM EXPECTS IT- TO WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE L. A. O. ON THE BEST DETERMINE FOR COUNTY NEEDS AND ALLOCATION FOR THESE FUNDS- AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE AS OPPOSED TO EACH OUR PUBLIC FILINGS- NEAR FUTURE AND AFTER. BE A JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEMBER FIRST REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD YOU ALSO AGREE THAT REPORTING SHOULD BE ROBUST AND MEANINGFUL. BUT WE'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIED OUTCOMES EIGHT IT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE INITIAL PROPOSAL AND MIGHT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR MORE IN DEPTH PROCESS. INTO IT WOULD GRANT MANAGEMENT OR ACADEMIC STUDIES THAT AGAIN FOR GOODNESS ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. AS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND AND ON PROBATION ENTITIES ADMINISTRATION THANKS OF THIS IS THE ISSUE AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE ANSWERED OF COURSE THIS IS INTENDED TO BE KIND OF A STATE WIDE EQUALIZER. SO THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ARE PRACTICING SORT OF THE JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY AND. WE BELIEVE THAT PROBATION. IF ALL OF THE COUNTY IN OTHER. FOR THE TROUT SERVICES. BUT OPEN THE COUNTY AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND NOT THAT. WE THINK WE SHOULD FUND. AT THIS PURPOSE REGARD PEOPLE. AND OUT OF THE CAR FUNCTION AND NOT. COUNTY SIR. FROM. BAXLEY WE THE PROBATION REPORT SERVE OUR GIVEN. ON GOINGS AND REGARD WE TRUST. OF TYPES OF REALIGNING. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE BUT ONE OF MOST OF. FOR FUNDING FOR. IT. WE HAVE ONE MORE ITEM LEFT OF ITEM ELEVEN THAT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. JUST A REMINDER PARTNER FINANCE. INCLUDES A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME QUARTERBACKS DISCORDANT COMPANY FUND FOR DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM TELEVISED IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DENOMINATION OF INFRACTION FINES AND FEES THAT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM WILL ELIMINATE DEBT OWED ON EXISTING FIND AT THESE FOR ABOUT TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC INFRACTION TICKETS ISSUED BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY FIFTEEN IN JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INDIVIDUALS WOULD SUBMIT A PAPER APPLICATION CORRECTLY TO THE TRIAL COURTS TO HAVE THEIR FINES AND FEES ELIMINATED THE ONE TIME FUNDING WILL BE USED TO BACK FILL CORK FUNDS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR LOST REVENUES AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM IN ADDITION FUNDING WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT TROUT WORKS. IN THE PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS INCREMENTAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE GROWTH THIS PROGRAM TO THE PUBLIC TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION AS SPECIFIED BY THE L. E. O. THERE ARE STILL CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATOR AS WELL AS THE TEACHER COUNSELOR POTENTIALLY REFINE THIS PROPOSAL. PLEASE. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I NEED ONLY WITH A LOT AND OFFICE- SO WE DO FOR THAT THIS. MERITS CAN. AS IT WOULD REAL TO LOWER IN AND- I'M AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND SO THERE ARE KEY QUESTIONS AND WE WOULD SUMMARIZE FOR OR BRING FOR TIER TENSION. THE FIRST IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PARTICIPATION RATE IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. RESULTING IN A LARGER REDUCTION IN FINE AND FEE REVENUE THAN. ANTICIPATED TO NEED IT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS HOW MUCH FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OUTRAGE COSTS. THE THIRD QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE BACK FULL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE DISTRIBUTED. AND THE FOURTH QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE PROGRAM OPERATE IN TANDEM- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL TO EXPAND ONLINE EDUCATION OF INFRACTIONS AND ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION STATEWIDE. AND SO ANSWERS TO TESE QUESTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO WAIVE THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST OTHER PRIORITIES. AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS STRUCTURED AND OPERATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND EXPECTATIONS. THE FINAL THING THAT WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT- IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY NEED TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO OTHER STATE FUNDS. THAT RECEIVE CONFINING THE REVENUE AND SUPPORT- ENDED THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE VERY OPTIONS VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR DOING SO- BUT A BACK FILL FOR THEM IS NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS. PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT THE L. A. L. HATH. LAID OUT- IN ADDITION TO THOSE QUESTIONS ON THE DEBT FORGIVENESS. PROGRAM I'D BE INTERESTED IN OUR DEFINITION FOR LOW INCOME AND WHAT THAT CAPTURES. AND THEN ARE WE STARTING TO ENGAGE AND- I GUESS A MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT JUST ONE TIMES BUT LOOKING AT ADJUSTING THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE AND FAIR. IT WILL BE IN FLORIDA- FOR ANYONE AND NOT JUST. AT THIS MOMENT OF SURPLUS. JUST A REMINDER BERMAN OF FINANCE- THIS DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM IS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND ASK NICELY APPOINTED OUT AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON CHECK THE BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD BE. PROVIDED TO US FOR WORKING IS A COMPLICATED DRAFT BE TROUBLING WHICH FOR THE PROPOSAL IN ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS WILL BE. WHO EXACTLY WOULD QUALIFY AS LOW INCOME AND WE'RE STILL WORKING TO SPECIFIED. WHAT LOW INCOME WOULD NEED AS IT RELATES TO THAT THE FACT. COPY. THE WOULD LET LOOK FORWARD TO THE TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT ON THAT DEFINITION A LOW INCOME DO WE HAVE ANY IS THIS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING AT. HOW TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION TO. MAKE THE SEPARATE EVENTS PROGRAMS PER MINUTE. SHOULD WE NOT TRY TO HELP THIS LONGTIME PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES NOT JUST WHEN WE HAVE ROSY. BUDGETS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BUT AS FAR AS THE DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES- RETROACTIVELY RELIEF FOR INFRACTION TICKETS EACH YEAR IN THE PAST TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MOVING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE- AND ENTERED INTO BEYOND THE QUALIFYING TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED THE- TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE OBJECTIVE WOULD BE FOR A PERSPECTIVE EARLY TO BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE ABILITY TO PAY. A PROGRAM WHERE INDIVIDUALS WOULD APPLY TO HAVE THEIR FINES AND FEES ARE REDUCED BY AT LEAST. BY 50% I'M SO THAT WOULD BE THE PLAN MOVING FORWARD. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS- SOME SORT OF PLAN A MOVING FORWARD I WOULD BE INTERESTED AND MORE ROBUST. DISCUSSIONS UP 50% IS HELPFUL BUT FOR SOME OF OUR LOW INCOME FOLKS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. ENOUGH OUT THERE AND SO I DO THINK AS WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF THE THING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK INTO. I WOULD THESE BE SOME PLANS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. WELL I UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO HAVE A PLAN TO ALSO BACK. AS SADDAM SERVICES THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. MR STILL. WELL CERTAINLY ON THAT LAST QUESTION A DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S COME UP I THINK IN IN CONTEXT OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S JUST A BIT OF A BANDAIDAND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TAKE  HARD LOOK AT THE FINES AND FEES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE'VE TOO LONG USED FINES AND FEES OR AS WAYS OF FUNDING PROGRAMS. YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S REALLY GOTTEN OUT OF HAND I THINK THE CHIEF JUSTICE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. SO THAT INVESTMENT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HAVING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT FINES AND FEES WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN AND HOW. ULTIMATELY WE FUND THAT. I JUST WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE TRIAL COURT BACKLOG AS WELL I'M VERY INTERESTED IN. A LOT MORE DETAIL AROUND. WHAT THOSE PROPOSALS ARE FOR REDUCING THE BACKLOG WE'VE HELD HEARINGS. WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN AND THERE WEREN'T NOT A LOT OF ANSWERS THAT CAME. OUT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO FOR US TO HAVE. A LOT MORE DIRECT. INPUT AND OVERSIGHT IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE. IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT I'M NOT TALKING AT ALL AT THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WE NEED TO HELP THE COURTS ENSURE THAT THEY ARE REDUCING THE THEIR BACKLOGS. BUT WE DID NOT GET VERY CLEAR ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT. THEY WOULD BE DOING OR HOW THEY WOULD BE DOING IT. AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT. OF AND IN INDEPENDENCE COUNTY BY COUNTY ALL FIFTY EIGHT COURTS WANTED TO DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WE WANT TO SEE SOME CONSISTENCY. IN A IN A PLAN AND IN MAY A PROGRAM. OKAY THEN WE WILL CONTINUE THIS CAFFEINE- THESE ITEMS TO APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON. TWO PANEL MEMBERS SIX THREE AND I HAVE CDCR TALK ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY.

IN ORDER TO FUND THE REMAINING HALF OF PROJECTS WITH GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF EXISTING LEASE REVENUE BOND FINANCING AUTHORITY. THEFUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS IS CURRENTLY DERIVED FROM BOND PROCEEDS.

ARE IN NINE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE AREAS YOU KNOW WE POTENTIALLY RISK. I THINK. I'M MAINTENANCE- JUST RELIABILITY AND OTHER KIND OF ISSUES WITH YES THE PLANT OPERATIONS AT THOSE FACILITIES- IT'S DRAMATICALLY ACTING POTENTIALLY THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPACT- ABILITY TO MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RISKS OF LITIGATE INJURY DESTRUCTIONS TO PROGRAMMING AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AS TO THE SECOND ISSUE ARE MOVING TOO QUICKLY- IT'S AN ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS I REQUESTED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THIS WOULD BRING THE TOTAL REQUEST FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT CDCR TWO HUNDRED MILLION- THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A LIST TO BE ATTACHED YEAH THOSE.

BASED BUDGET FOR SPECIAL RIPARIAN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROHIBITING CITIES HERE FROM SPENDING THE FUNDS ON PRISON BETTER STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE.

PHASES OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY STOCKTON FACILITY BE INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE YARDS PROJECT WITH TOTAL PROJECT COSTS OF FOUR POINT THREE SIX EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS FUNDING TO DESIGN TEN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE YARDS AND FACILITY B. AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY STOCKTON THIS WILL ALLOW MAXIMUM CUSTODY PATIENTS RECEIVING INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH. TREATMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN MORE OUT OF CELL RECREATION THERAPY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PLAN. THE PROPOSAL ALSO WOULD ADDRESS THE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE MONITORING REPORT FILED BY THE COLEMAN SPECIAL MASTER. IN WHICH IT IS INDICATED THAT MAXIMUM CUSTODY PATIENTS HAD EXTREMELY LIMITED TIME. FOR STRUCTURED OR UNSTRUCTURED OUT OF CELL THERAPY ACTIVITY EACH WEEK. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THEM AT THIS TIME. CABALLERO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL GIVEN THIS PARTICULAR PRISON IS VERY UNLIKELY TO BE CLOSED. THANK YOU ARE NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO. GET THE F. R. ALL IN THE LONG TERM FACILITY PLAN OUT THERE AND SO I THINK UNTIL WE HAVE THAT. SETTLED THIS COMMITTEE THIS AND FEEL COMFORTABLE IN MOVING FORWARD I HAVE. WITH WITH ANY OF THESE RESOURCES- AND SO IT JUST FELT THAT WE COULD GET TO A CONCLUSION SOON- YOU'VE HEARD IN PREVIOUS. COMMITTEES THAT DESIRE STRONG DESIRE FROM THESE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT THERE AND GET TO A PLACE WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CAN THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON. TWO PADDLED SEVEN. AND WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS UP INTO TWO CHUNKS WILL HAVE ITEMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT FIRST CDCR NON CAPITAL OUTLAYS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST NAME A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTED OVERALL ON COURSE RATED AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION OF ABOUT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ASPIRIN PROJECTIONS NOW ESTIMATED INCARCERATED POPULATION OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF ROUGHLY ELEVEN THOUSAND. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO. THE RESUMPTION OF INTAKE AND SPECIFICALLY A RAMP UP OF THE INTAKE FROM THOSE COUNTY JAILS WHERE INMATES HAVE BEEN HOUSE DURING THE COOK AT NINETEEN ENDEMIC- THESE PROJECTIONS NOW ESTIMATE AT WEEKLY INTAKE OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS- WHICH IS. MADE RELATIVELY LATE IN APRIL. THAT MAKE INTO FOREVER WAS ABOUT SIX AND TO SEVEN SO IT'S A VERY ELEVATE NUMBER- IT DEPARTMENTS IT'S S. ESTIMATING TO INTAKE THOSE COUNTY JAILS. I'M ON NO ON THE LAST TIME I TO THE THAT. I'VE MET THAT THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND. IN COUNTY JAIL AWAITING TRANSFER AS OF MAY FOURTEENTH THAT NUMBER IS DOWN TO ABOUT SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED SO WE HAVE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THAT BACKLOG. AT THE DEPARTMENT AND IT TAKES ME OR INDIVIDUALS- INTO THE PRESENCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ALSO PROJECTS UP. POP OF A FORTY THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET. AT THIS IS A BY TWO- ROUGHLY FIVE. IN THE MAY REVISION- THIS WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTED A POPULATION IN JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR THE WARDS OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THAT'S NOW DECLINED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY TWO IN THE BUDGET YEAR HI THIS IS ANTICIPATED TO RESULT IN SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY TEN POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AS OUT. JUVENILE JUSTICE AND IN A CONTAINED BEGINS CALTRAIN OFFICIALS THOSE PARTS TO THE COUNTIES. THAT ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE SECOND. A NO DEAL WITH THE L. A. L. THEN MAYBE VISION SEEMS ABOUT THAT THAT DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MORE INMATES IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED AT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH TRANSLATES TO OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COST- AS MISTREATMENT NOTED THIS IS. LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH- THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTION THAT WILL IT WILL- BEGIN IN TAKING OUR CONTINUE IN TAKING THE BACKLOG OF INMATES FROM COUNTY JAILS THAT HAVE BEEN. SERVING THEIR PRISON TERMS THERE WHILE IN THE INTAKE HAS BEEN STOPPED OVER THE OVER MUCH OF THE PAST YEAR DUE TO COVER IT- HOWEVER THESE PROJECTIONS DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME THAT THOSE INMATES HAVE BEEN SERVING. ON THEIR PRISON SENTENCES WHILE THEY'VE BEEN INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAIL- SO WE FIND THAT THIS- THIS THE POPULATION IS LIKELY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER ESTIMATED AS A RESULT- ALTHOUGH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS FAIRLY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. ON WHAT THE ACTUAL POPULATION WILL BE- AND SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING BUT ADOPTING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REFER TO THE GENERAL FUND ANY FUNDING IT RECEIVED ASSOCIATED WITH INMATES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUT IT DID. NOT END UP ACTUALLY SERVING. NO THIS ENSURE THAT THE- DOES NOT USE THE BUDGET FOR THE M. POPULATION FOR PER. THAT MAYBE PRIORITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT I'M NOT NECESSARILY PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE SO THIS IS REALLY- TO HELP ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- AND NOW I'D LIKE TO PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE LUCAS MARIO TO- COMMENT ON OTHER ASPECTS OF THE POPULATION RELATED. PROPOSALS IF YOU ARE THE L. A. O. OKAY SPEAKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES POSITION WHICH CPR JEFF THE NUMBER OF PETITIONS BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE INMATE POPULATION ANNUALLY. LAST YEAR TO GET YOUR SPENT ON TO FILL ALL OF THE SERVICE CALL INSURANCE AND I FEEL I SURPLUS. FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE VACANT POSITIONS FOR BALLOTS FOR EXAMPLE DISCARDED UNDER COURT ORDER TO A CERTAIN LEVEL SERVICES FOR FIVE YEAH. PSYCHIATRIST APPOINTMENTS AND VISITS AND SO THEY AFFECT. ME DATA PHILBRICK I CRIED FOR EXERTIONS AT NINETY PERCENT. BECAUSE OF THAT APARTMENT BUILDING THOSE POSITIONS THEY'VE REPRODUCTIVE A PORTION OF THE SALARY SAVINGS TO SUPPORT HIGH CONTRACTORS LIKE PRIVATELY. REGISTRY SERVICES. GOOD LUCK MARKEDLY IT BY MANY BIG THIS ARE BEING. AND ALL TICKETS ARE PLAN TO FULLY UNLIMITED POSITION IS A QUESTION TO READ A LARGE PORTION OF FUNDING THE FOR THE- BASICALLY THEY EIGHT INTENDED TO. RETAIN FOR NINE POINT THREE AM IN TWO TWENTY ONE. AND FORTY ONE THREE IN TWENTY TWO ONE ONE GOLAN- DATA. BE REQUIRED. THE MINISTRY EDITOR OF THE ABOUT MILLION OF WOULD GET USED FOR CHARACTER BREAKFAST OR SERVICE. RATHER AMOUNT WOULD BE USED ABOUT HEALTH SO IF YOU COULD A LIMITED THE- AND THEN IN THAT THIS FUNDING WHAT. I FORGOT WE ADDRESS OTHER PURPOSES IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH. BUT THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED A INFORMATION BECAUSE WHAT PURPOSES ARE SUPPORT OF THE THREE. FUNDING ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDED FOR. READING A LOT OF MILLION AND THEN BASIS THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. A COUPLE FOR WHAT WAS A KIND REGISTRY SERVICES. AND EVERYTHING- COMMITTEE TERM IS BECAUSE THESE LIKE I BREXIT FROM THAT ARE. SUPPOSED TO BE- I THINK SO UNTIL ALL OF THE RESTRICTION CARE. BUILD THEIR- SEVERAL SORT OF PSYCHIATRIST THIS AND I SUCH DON'T ON GOING PUBLIC IS ACROSS. AND THEN AMERICAN NOT A READ THE REMAINING WITH BY THE- AND THEM IT'S INTO. THAT THE REDIRECTED IS YOU FOR A PURPOSE CONSISTENT WITH THE LESSER PRIORITIES. TWENTY JUST NAY ABOUT A FINANCE AND I JUST TO REST. AS RECORD. TO INCLUDE BUDGET THAT LANGUAGE. SIX IT WITH A COPY PROJECTIONS AND FUNDING SO WITH. I WOULD ARE COMMITTED ON BELIEVE THAT FUNDING THAT. LANGUAGES NECESSARY FOR JOB. AMAZONIAN THAT THEY IS A LOT OF FUN SIR WITH THESE FOR. PRODUCTION IN REGARD TO THE INTAKE REGARD TO IT. NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT HAVE SERVED ALREADY COUNTY JAIL EVERY WEEK YOU WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT. YOUR PROJECTIONS- AND WE DO IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH THOSE HOWEVER THAT WOULD BE AMENDED INTO. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR POPULATION AND AGAIN WE JUST DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO INCLUDE BUDGET BELT LANGUAGE SPECIFIC. TO THIS UPCOMING BUDGET EAR- AS FAR AS THAT PSYCHIATRY POSITIONS AND FINAL TURN. THAT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE I WAS. I WASN'T A DIFFERENT OF FINANCE OF INTEREST TO THE ALEJO'S. REGARDING THE MENTAL. POPULATION IT. THE MINISTRATIONS FOR SOME ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION TO ADDRESS THE ALEJO'S CONCERNS AND WERE ULTIMATELY OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AN ONGOING SOLUTION. EVENTUALLY BE ADMINISTRATION TAILORED A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET GAP I'M FOR THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM THAT AND THAT PROVIDES ESSENTIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M TO PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AND SO THERE WAS IT KIND OF AB I'M RISKY IF WE DIDN'T AT- CAN ADDRESS THAT THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL AND SAID UNDER THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FILL POSITIONS BECAUSE- THEY WOULD BE PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE A PORTION OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS WHILE RETAINING REGISTRY FUNDING. JUST WANT TO NOTE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT TYPICALLY DO THIS TYPE OF RIGHT SIZING EXERCISE- BUT FOR THE SIGNIFICANT POPULATION ADJUSTMENT AND THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF KOBE NINETEEN. I'M SO HAPPY TAKE CONTINUOUS CONVERSATIONS. AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION. REFORM OF THE L. L. BIG AN- I DON'T RECOGNIZE. THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROGRAM I GET BACK PROVIDED THE MINISTER CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE REPRODUCTIVE. IS BEING USED FOR PURPOSES CONSISTENT WITH THE LOGIC OF PRIORITIES THANK YOU. OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE TO CLOSURE OF THE LOCATIONAL INSTITUTION UPDATE LENNY SHOULD MATTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS PROPOSAL IS A REDUCTION OF FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION IN ADDITIONAL SAVINGS RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF THE DUAL VOCATIONAL INSTITUTION.

SERVICES INCLUDING THE VICTIM OFFENDER DIALOGUE. NO REALLY OF CONCERN MR. AND I WASN'T SURE WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COVERING IF YOU FOR INSTANCE EACH YEAR IS REQUESTING RESOURCES AND TO EXPAND ITS CIVIL RIGHTS OPERATIONS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM AND THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ENABLE CDCR TO ACHIEVE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWENTY. EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR OF THAT I WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND THESE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE CDCR TO FULLY IMPLEMENT A CENTRALIZED DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT PROCESS AND THEREBY REDUCING THE RISK OF BIAS IN INCONSISTENT FINDINGS ANY CHEATING FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALAVERAS GUIDANCE WE KNOW THAT THIS UP THIS PROPOSAL WAS INITIALLY PUT FORWARD IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WITHDRAWN- IN LIGHT OF THAT FISCAL.

AS A BARGAIN MY NAME IS MENTIONED IN THE PROGRAM DOESN'T INCLUDE A RESOURCES PHONE ABOUT INFLATION IN THOSE PARTS OF SARGANTWOULD BE PROVIDED THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. I RECOMMEND MAKING THE FUNDING LIMITED TERM. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION NO LATER THAN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING DATA- WILL BE HELPFUL TO GET PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS- TO POSSIBLY UNDERTAKE EXPANSION THIS. TARGET EXPANSIONS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- BUT IT'S NOT INTENDED TO SAY THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ALREADY EVIDENCE BASED FOR EFFECTIVE- YOU KNOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE. ARE CHANGES THAT IS THERE ARE WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION WORLD- AGAIN INCREASED ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL TRAINING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- AND THEY'VE BEEN PROVEN IN OTHER CONTEXTS WHICH IS.

INCLUDING PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND THESE RESOURCES WOULD HELP SUPPORT BACK ALL. NOELIA CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK YOU AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOW QUICKLY COVER ISSUES SEVEN EIGHT AND I'LL JUMP AHEAD A LITTLE BIT TO ISSUE NINE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING VARIOUS STATUTORY CHANGES THE FIRST IS TO CODIFY EXISTING PRACTICES AS IT RELATES TO COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS. THE SECOND INVOLVES CREATING A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL FACILITATE STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS AT PINE GROVE YOUTH CONSERVATION CAMP AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN CHAPTER AT THREE THREE SEVEN STATUS OF TWENTY TWENTY I SB ARE THE BETTER KNOWN AS I SPEAK TO THREE AND THE THIRD WILL EXPAND THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD TO INCLUDE EXPERTS I SPECIFICALLY.

MISTER JONES SAWYER BUT I JUST WANTED TO CAMP- TO COMMENT ON NUMBER FIVE TO VALLEY STATE PRISON IN HARASSMENT. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PERSONALLY GONE TO NORWAY. WITH THE SECRETARY'S CDCR AND THE PRESIDENT OF CCPOA- I FOUND IT. NOT ONLY IS AN INSTRUCTIVE. BUT IT IS THE WAY TO GO AND I ENCOURAGE IS NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT THIS MODEL. AND PROVIDE THE ENHANCEMENTS TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. IS TO DOCUMENT. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ESTABLISH SOME BENCHMARKS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE FUTURE. THIS IS A FUTURE CORRECTIONS AND I SAID I KNOW IT'S JUST AN ITEM NUMBER FIVE. BUT IT HAD IMPLICATIONS DATA FAR EXTEND. JUST WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT COULD- CHANGE THE WAY WE DO CORRECTIONS SIR FOR THE FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. SO OUT OF THE IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. WE NEED TO DO THIS. THANK YOU- I DO APPRECIATE WITH A SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES ARE DOING OUT THERE AND- THAT'S EXCITING THAT YOU TOOK THAT TRIP OUT THERE. IT ALSO LOOK AT THE PATERNITY LEAVE THAT OUT IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES IT'S SO. MUCH MORE GENEROUS WITH THIS WE ARE REPLICATING TO US SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS PROGRAM FELT THIS WAY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD OCCUR THAT TO THE GOVERNOR FOR ME. WE WILL I SEE YOU GOT AHEAD OF ME ON WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ADAM THANK YOU TWELVE- BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY COVERED ITEM NINE AND ALEJO SAID THEY HAD NO CONCERNS IT WILL ACTUALLY MOVE ON TO. TEN THROUGH. TWELVE THANK YOU MOVING OUT TO ITEM TEN I JUST NEED TO BE A PART IN A FINANCE THIS REQUEST IS FOR THREE POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY ONE. THREE POSITIONS I'M GOING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I THIS IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BOARD COMMISSIONERS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH. THROUGH THE TWENTY. BY TWENTY ONE AND THAT.

BROKERAGES BY VIDEOCONFERENCE CONTINUALLY AT ELEVEN EIGHT SENDING HEARING NOTICES TO SENTENCING JUDGES AND CRAP IF YOU TECHNICAL INSECURITIES AN EXISTING RECORDS TO THE PERIPHERAL. CARE ACT. NO ONE CONCERNS ON THIS FOR. HI THIS IS MICHAEL QUESTION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN ST BY TELECINCO TREE PROGRAM SUPERVISION. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL HUNDRED NINE POSITIONS ON GOING. FORGET IT TELESAT WITH MANAGEMENT TO PROVIDE THREE OVERSIGHT. CURRENTLY TELECHECK HYDRANTS IN THE PROGRAM ARE MANAGED BY ON SITE SUPERVISORS WHICH REQUIRES THE REDIRECTION OF THE SUPERVISORY POSITIONS FROM THEIR EXISTING DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN SUPPORT OF ON SITE STAFF. ADDITIONALLY THE STRUCTURE IS NOT RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF TELUS PSYCHIATRY SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ADD DEDICATED TELE PSYCHIATRY SHE PROVIDERS TO ENHANCE PROGRAM OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE FOR IMPROVED SERVICE DELIVERY. THE REASON WHY ON STAGE YOU PROVIDERS ARE BEING USED AT THIS TIME IS BECAUSE WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS TWO THOUSAND NINE STAFFING PLAN WAS CREATED IN COURT APPROVED THE PROGRAM DID NOT EXIST ANYWHERE NO. I. TELL A SECOND TWO SUPERVISORS. THIS STATEWIDE LISTEN THANK YOU FOR IS HELPING SURE MACHINE THE COR MAN 9% FILL RATE FOR PSYCH. AND CONTINUED REDIRECTION OF ONSITE POSITIONS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND THREATENS THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE STATE BY A PROGRAM HAS MADE OVER THE YEARS. HAVING TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. NO ELEGANCE OR SOME THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY MOVING ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT PROGRAM STANDARDIZATION AND INTEGRATION. THIS REQUEST IS FOR THIRTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ON GOING A BUDGET YOU'RE WANTING NINE GOING IN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR POSITIONS AND ALL YEARS TO STANDARDIZE STAFFORD MODELS ACROSS THE FIVE SHE SHE ARE OPERATING IT'S AN TO SUPPORT TARGETED STAFFING INCREASES. FOR PERFORMING OPERATIONALLY CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. WHEN THE WHEN IT WHEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THREE TIPS ST PATRICK INPATIENT PROGRAMS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. TO CDC ARE BUT THIS TRANSFER WAS UNDERSTOOD AS BEING SIMPLY A SHIFTING OF RESOURCES. ARE FROM DISH TO SEE IF YOU ARE AND THAT THE OPERATIONS ADDITIONAL FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT- IN MANY WAYS FROM CDG ARE. I SO THE PROPOSED WOULD FULLY INTEGRATE THREE LIFT AND SHIFT TRIPS WITHIN CITY OPERATIONS AND BRING STAFFING INTO ALIGNMENT ACROSS THE PITCH BASED ON CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY IT'S- HARD TO DISCUSS SPECIFICS OF THIS PROPOSAL I WILL. BE SURE TO PROBLEMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. BECAUSE ONE OF THE L. A. O- IT'S FOR BOTH WE KIND OF BROTHER DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION IT DEMONSTRATED THE NUMBER REQUESTED POSITIONS IN THE PROPOSAL OR THE INCREASING STRESS LEVELS ARE NECESSARY FOR EXAMPLE CITIES ARE NOT DEMONSTRATED THE CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS AND THAT PERHAPS ARE NECESSARY NECESSARILY. I'M IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE IN ADDITION TO WHAT CITIES ARE PATH INDICATED IT. ALREADY HAS A VISION CAPACITY TO MEET THE PROJECT THE NEEDS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION THE PROPOSAL THIS IS A PRIVATE DIGITAL TREATMENT CAPACITY AT THE MOST. EXPENSIVE LEVEL OF CARE. WELL WE ARE BUDGETS ARE NOT APPROVED TO GO. UNLESS YOU SEE ARE PROVIDE SUFFICIENT JUST. WHETHER PROVIDE WROTE THE PROPOSED TOPIC. AND A SURPLUS THE PROPOSAL. OUR THINK YOU APARTMENT FINANCE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MICHAEL IN. OUR COLLEAGUES FROM I CBC ARE HERE AND ABLE TO LAND THEIR EXPERTISE I'M IF MEMBERS HAVE ANY SPECIFIC. TO RESPOND TO THE ALLEY OF COMMENTS THAT PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE QUITE DETAILED BACKUP THAT THAT DESCRIBES THE METHODOLOGIES FOR OUT ALL OF THE POSITIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST AND SO. WE'RE HAPPY ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION I'VE NEEDED TO SATISFY THE ALEJO'S CONCERNS BUT THERE WAS CERTAINLY A VERY DETAILED AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN- PROPOSED TO JUSTIFY AND THE POSITIONS REQUESTED HERE AND THAT NOT ONLY COVERS. WHAT IS NEEDED TO RECOGNIZE CDC ARE UNIQUE OPERATIONAL NEEDS BECAUSE WE JUST IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN THAT THREE AND I THINK YES THERE CAN BE SOME PROGRAM FACILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE HOSPITALS TO CCR IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS HAD. DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS I NEED SPEND CDC ARE SO IT THIS POINT THIS IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAIN UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE THREE PEPS AND THAT WORK CAN SHIFTED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AS WELL AS THE TWO PATHS THAT CDCR INITIATED INDEPENDENTLY. AND ARE FULLY STAFFED TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED TO MEET FEDERAL AND STATE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD KNOW IS THAT THAT'S THE ONLY IT WAS RECOMMENDING THAT CDCR WOULD HAVE TO SHOW NEGATIVE. IMPACTS TO PATIENTS AS A RESULT OF AND NOT HAVING THE STAFFING- WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SHORT SIGHTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S OPINION AND ULTIMATELY WOULD PUT- CITIES DARKENED AT RISK OF VARIOUS THINGS INCLUDING. CORKED MANDATED REQUIREMENTS WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND EXPERTISE. CAN OUR CDC COMMON ON THE- ELLOS. THAT CDCR HAS AND AT A RATE HAS TO BE OF TO MEET THE PROJECT THE NEEDS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION AND IF SO HOW DO WE JUSTIFY THIS ADDITIONAL COLORS HERE. IT UP MATTER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH- I SPEAK TO THAT WE HAVE VARIOUS LEVELS OF CARE FOR THE MOST SEVERELY ILL INMATES THAT WE TREAT SO THERE ARE A- BEDS INTERMEDIATE BAGS AND THEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS TO ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF AN EMERGENCY ROOM- AND- THAT'S OFTEN WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN NEEDS SOME CAPACITY IN SOME PARTS OF ROOM- BUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS FLEXING THOSE BEDS TO TREAT. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE SO IF WE STAFF THEM TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE WE CAN USE THEM TO FILL UP OR TO TAKE UP ANY SLACK YEAH THAT'S NECESSARY IN THE OTHER LEVELS OF CARE AS WELL WE'RE WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT YES AGE TO POP IN THE STATE HOUSE. BILLS MODEL WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX BEDS OVER THERE THAT WE SEND OUR PATIENTS TO- AND WHEN THEIR PATIENTS ARE TOO VIOLENT OR OR OTHERWISE UNMANAGEABLE THE END UP WITH US AND SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE. OUR OFFICERS CORRECTIONS OFFICERS AND A LOT OF OTHER. THINGS THAT THE IS IT JUST NOT ABLE TO OFFER AS MISS YOU HAVE MENTIONED- AND WE FEEL THAT THIS IS THIS IS A. REALLY THAT THE- NASA- CORRECTION TO. JUST TO OUR- AND SO. NEED MENTIONED THAT IT'S BOTH WE WOULD HAVE MENTAL OF HEALTH STAFF AND CUSTODY STAFF. WHAT IS THAT BREAK DOWN IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SO THIS PROPOSAL DOES BREAK DOWN IT MENTAL HEALTH KEY STEP NURSING PIECE THAT CUSTODY PEACE AND- ALL ALL OF THE OTHER MISCELLANEOUS- ASPECTS THAT GO INTO THIS. IS THERE A PARTICULAR QUESTION I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER OR COURT MY COLLEAGUE DOING READER MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER. WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS BECAUSE LOOK LIKE HOW MANY STAFF I MEANING YOU MENTAL HEALTH HOW MANY NURSES HAVE ANY CUSTODY STAFF DOES THIS BE. AFTER I WILL DEBT DEFERRED IT TO A READER. HERE'S OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FISCAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MANAGER FROM THE DETAILS OF THE STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS ARE IN THE PROPOSAL ARE YOU I COULD SHARE THOSE AFTER THIS- AFTER THIS HEARING TODAY. BEAR IN THERE I WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WALK TO EVERYONE OF THE SPREAD- AS FAR AS THE- FLEXPAY CONCERN- WE ADDED THOSE POSITIONS AND- HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT THEIR NET ZERO REQUEST BECAUSE THOSE POSITIONS WERE APPROVED IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. MENTAL HEALTH BED MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL SO WE RECEIVE THOSE OPPOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE FLEX BEDS AND THAT PROPOSAL AND WE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT AND INCLUDE THOSE IN THE TOTAL ALLOCATIONS. SO- THE FLEX BED- STAFFING THAT'S IDENTIFIED IS OFFSET WITH EXISTING AUTHORITY- FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY JUSTIN. AND THIS IS FROM ABOUT THAT EXCEPT THE DIRECTOR SAY ABOUT HEALTH JUST WANTED TO AB ONE THING WHICH IS WE ALSO ARE RUNNING. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BEDS FOR INPATIENT- DAD ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE TAKEN DOWN- AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOSE ARE UNLICENSED BY CDPH THAT CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND A HUNDRED AND TWELVE WITH THOSE THAT ARE- LICENSE BUT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS TEMPORARY- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CULLMAN COURT. SO WE CONTINUE TO. PLAN FOR THE TOTAL CAPACITY THAT WE EXPECT WE WILL NEED OVER TIME TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THESE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE ARE ARE BEING CHUCKLED AT THE SAME TIME. SO IT IS THE- IT'S THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE. WE ARE FREE FOR USE THAT- WE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME TO REVIEW THAT WITHIN THESE PROPOSALS- ARE AND WHAT WE DID TO GET HAS INFORMATION KIND OF SPREAD ALL OVER THE PLACE SO WE CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER SO. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF E CAN GET THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO START TO MAKE YOUR CASE HERE- IT IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING BUT YOU CAN'T PULL UP YOUR SPREADSHEETS AND READ THEM QUICKLY TO ME- BUT- I. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THIS IS DETAILS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. OKAY- OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SEVENTH. RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON WE'RE STILL IN THE SAME PANEL WE HAVE ITEMS THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN- AND SO WE COULD GO AHEAD AND BEGIN THAT. PERFECT I HAVE A FRIEND THE LEAD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR ITEM THIRTEEN THE STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIXED VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CITIES ARE REQUEST ONE TIME AND ONGOING RESOURCES TO INSTALL FIX VIDEO CAMERAS. ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IN ORDER TO INTERDICT CONTRABAND AND PROVIDE OBJECTIVE VIDEO EVIDENCE- FOR VARIOUS INSTANCES OF. NEFARIOUS CONDUCT WHICH ARE CRITICAL CORE FUNCTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CITIES ARE REQUEST SEVEN POSITIONS AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. TO INSTALL THESE VIDEO CAMERAS ASK FOR INSTITUTIONS SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO. CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION EMIL CREEK STATE PRISON. AND SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT THE DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO A STATEWIDE ROLLOUT. THIS IS WHY THE REQUEST INCLUDES- RESOURCES FOR TEN INSTITUTIONS IN BOTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- SPECIFICALLY- THOSE TWO YEARS REQUEST TWENTY TWO POSITIONS AT NINETY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. AND THE THIRTY FOUR POSITION AND NINETY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND RESPECTIVELY. AND WITHOUT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ERIC SWANSON AT CDC ARE IN CASE HE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THANKS THIS IS ERIC SWANSON ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES AT CDCR. THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR DEPARTMENT AUDIO VISUAL SURVEILLANCE AS INTEGRAL TO SEE THIS YEAR'S ABILITY TO MONITOR ACTIVITY WITHIN ITS-INSTITUTIONS. AND MAINTAIN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE INCARCERATED POPULATION AND STUFF. AFFECTED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FACILITATE CONTRABAND INTERDICTION INTERDICTION AND SUPPORT ENQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF AN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL MISCONDUCT.THESE SYSTEMS GENERALLY SERVE AS A DETERRENT FOR IMPROPER OR ILLICIT ACTIVITIES THEREBY IMPROVING SAFETY AND ENHANCING OPERATIONS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS. PRETTY RECORDING TECHNOLOGY CDCR TO CAPTURE AND STORE AUDIO OR VIDEO EVIDENCE IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY RESOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF% MISCONDUCT. USE OF FORCE AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AS WELL AS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF WRITER INTRODUCTION AND POSSESSION OF DRUGS AND CONTRABAND. HIGH QUALITY VISUAL RECORDINGS OF INCIDENTS SERVICE STRONG EVIDENCE INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. EXISTENCE OF VIDEO OR AUDIO EVIDENCE IMPROVES THE INSTITUTION'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT TO INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS COMPARED WITH INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE RELIANT SOLELY ON EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY. IT ALSO ASSIST LIEUTENANTS OF THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY LIEUTENANTS CAN USE VIDEO RECORDING TWO DECADES RULES VIOLATION REPORTS VIDEO RECORDING CAN ALSO ASSIST IN FINDING LOST OR MISPLACED ITEMS WHICH HELPS AVOID THE SHUTOUT OF INSTITUTIONS PROGRAM. TO SEARCH FOR THAT MATTER VOIGTS EXTENDED LOCKDOWNS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. THIS IS NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR US IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CD STORE INSTALLED ON AVS ASPIRIN. BUT IT OUR SYSTEM WITH TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS IN DESIGNATED HIGH TRAFFIC THE BORDERS CONGREGATION AREAS OF HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON. THIS SERVED AS A TECHNICAL PILOT ENABLING CDCR TO TEST THE VIABILITY OF OPERATING THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT ON CDC OUR NETWORK. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CITIES HERE RECEIVE FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE VSS AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON AND INSTALL IT AT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. THESE LOCATIONS WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR A THE SS BASED ON CRITERIA. SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS. ARE THESE RESOURCES AND COMPLEMENTARY FUNDING INCLUDED IN A PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE THE ARMSTRONG COURT COMPLAINTS PROPOSAL. WILL BE ABLE CDCR TO INSTALL FIX SECURITY CAMERAS AT NINE TO TEN INSTITUTIONS PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL TRANSFORM SURVEILLANCE ACROSS THE PRISON SYSTEM AND GREATLY INCREASE CDC OUR CAPACITY TO OPERATE SAFE EFFECTIVE PRISONS. THANK YOU. CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE L. A. O. WE GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE- IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO EXPAND GIVEN THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO EVALUATE- ACT ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT- WOULD HAVE BEEN OF GREAT CONCERN RECENTLY MESSAGE COMMITTEE TO WHERE- BUT WE ARE GETTING THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH- TWO OTHER. THAT WILL DISCUSS WEEK- TAKES CDC STATEWIDE WITH VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ACCESS TO ALL PRINT ALL STATER IN PRISONS THAT ARE NOT. THE TWO SCHEDULED TO BE CLOSED FOR THAT DON'T ALREADY HAVE A VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT INSTALLING VIDEO OUT OF PRISON THAT IS SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED. AND WE ALSO FIND THERE'S NO NEED TO FUND THE INSTALLATION OF THE TWENTY- PRISONS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FIND IN. OUR EARS AT THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME BACK IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR TO REQUEST FUNDING FOR THOSE ADDITION PRESENT AT THAT TIME AN ACT THAT AT WHICH POINT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE GREATER CLARITY ABOUT WHICH ADDITIONAL PRISONS. MAY BE CLOSED IN THE FUTURE. SO I'D ALSO MENTION THAT THE PRISON THAT WHICH THERE IS AN EXISTING. COURT ORDER RELATED TO THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE WILL RECEIVE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE- IN A SEPARATE BE A SEPARATE PROPOSAL- THIRTIES PROPOSED SEPARATELY- AND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IF JUST THE FIRST YEAR IS FUNDED WITH- WOULD COVER. WHICH IS WHAT WE RECOMMEND IT WOULD COVER AN ADDITIONAL FOUR PRESENCE SO- THE STATE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF PRISONS THAT ARE SORT OF THE HIGHEST MOST SERIOUS CONCERN- THE DRIVE THE MOST SERIOUS CONCERNS IT SEEMS TO BE SEEMS TO BE REGARDING AT STAFF MISCONDUCT ISSUES. SO IN SOME WE RECOMMEND ONLY APPROVING THE FUNDING FOR IT THOUGH IT'S FOR PRISONS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR- AND THEN LETTING ADMINISTRATION COME BACK. FOR FUTURE PRESIDENTS POTENTIALLY. I THINK WOULD DEPART OF FINDING. TO THE MINISTRY PLAN DOES PROPOSE AT FIND- INSTALLATION OF- FIXED AT SECURITY CAMERAS OVERTHREE YEARS SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY. I'M TO DETERMINE WHICH PROJECTS ME MOVE FORWARD IN WHICH YEARS AG GIVEN THAT INFORMATION AND POPULATION PROJECTIONS ARE CHANGING IN ALMOST REAL TIME. SO THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES LIKE THAT I THE INVESTMENT HERE IS TO CREATE CERTAINTY THAT WORK WERE ROLLING THIS TECHNOLOGY OUT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS SO THAT. I SEE HERE IS ABLE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH- A STEEP WIDE ROLLOUT TAKEN IN COMBINATION WITH COMPLEMENTARY EFFORTS. I AM WE ALSO NO CERTAINTY OF FUNDING IS HELPFUL FOR CDC ARE IN BOTH THE PLANNING AND THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS SEES AND SO IT GIVES THEM SOME CERTAINTY TO BE ABLE TO BE. PLANNING FOR THE NEXT PROJECT THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND- BEYOND THOSE IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE MINISTRATION NOTES THAT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE HAVE. HADN'T MENTIONED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING POPULATION PROJECTIONS. AND GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY AND IT IT MAKES SENSE TO KIND OF MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN AB HOLDING UP THIS DEPLOYMENT THAT WOULD KIND OF BE COUNTER INTUITIVE ARE CONTRARY. TO YOU TIME. GOING TO EASIER TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL STATEWIDE AND SAID THAT THE BENEFIT OF US- OF COULD INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WOULD NOT BE FULLY REALIZED AND THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO OUR PLAN AND WE'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. OKAY THEY HAVE ANY FRIENDS OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE LOUIS NINE TO ISSUE FOURTEEN THE ARMSTRONG COURT COMPLIANCE CONTINUATION. SINCE OUR REQUEST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO POSITIONS AND EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN ORDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE RECENT MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ARMSTRONG COURT ORDER- THE COURT ORDERED THE START OF INSTALL FIX VIDEO CAMERAS BODY WORN CAMERAS. STAFFING FOR THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION ALSO IT AIMS AN ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORY STAFF IN. EXACTLY LIKE A. B. SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ARMSTRONG COURT ORDER AND CORRESPONDING BCP THAT FOCUS. ON THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. SO THE CURRENT ORDER FROM MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE- FOCUSES ON FIVE INSTITUTIONS CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY CALIFORNIANS TUITION FOR WOMEN. KERN VALLEY STATE PRISON AND THE REMAINING YARDS AT CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES COUNTY- TWO OF WHICH WERE INCORPORATED IN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. AND AGAIN WITH THAT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ERIC SWANSON FROM CDCR FOR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU YES SO- I WILL GO OVER AND GET THE LIST OF PRISONS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST MENTIONED BUT JUST. THIS COURT ORDER IS RESPONDING TO A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE U. S. DISTRICT COURT- ORDER FROM THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ORDERED CDC ARE TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO IMPLEMENT REMEDIAL MEASURES OF THE FIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE JUST MENTIONED. I ALSO WE JUST TALKED ABOUT OUR OUR STANDING VIDEO OR AUDIO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ON WHICH WE WILL INSTALL IT THESE. FIVE PRISONS- BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT THE THREE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS A PROPOSAL. BY THE COURT ORDERED AS YOU DESIRE TO BEGIN USING BODY WORN CAMERAS FOR ALL CORRECTIONAL OFFICER TO THE FIVE INSTITUTIONS. WHO MAY INTERACT WITH DISABLED INCARCERATED PEOPLE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE ORDER. THIS FOLLOWS THE INTRODUCTION OF BODY WORN CAMERAS AT R. J. D. IN LATE JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. PROFIL THIS PROPOSAL WOULD AUTHORIZE DEPLOYMENT OF. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED TO BE WORN A BODY. BY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS PERSONAL. BOTH THE STANDARD CAMERAS BODY CAMERAS WALKOUT EAT EAT CDCR. IN OUR CONTRABAND INTERDICTION EFFORTS INVESTIGATION SURROUNDING IN BEING ITS INCIDENCE. AND ENHANCE OUR STAFF ACCOUNTABILITY. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE COURT ORDER- PAST TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE SUPERVISORY STAFF BY POSTING ADDITIONAL STAFF ARE VERY WATCHES AT ALL FACILITIES THESE FIVE PRISONS. THE STAFF WILL ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH NEWLY ESTABLISHED GUIELINES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SOME OF THE DUTIES INCLUDE TRAINING PERSONNEL REVIEWING VIDEO FOOTAGE CONDUCTING DAILY TOURS OF HOUSING UNITS LEADING INVESTIGATIONS OF ALLEGATIONS GRIEVANCES BUT THEN I FIND CORRECTIVE MEASURES. REPORTING FINDINGS MONITORING APPROPRIATE HOUSING OF INMATES INSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO PROGRAMS SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES. FINALLY SIMILAR TO THE ORDER AT RGD THE COURT ORDERED AN EXPANSION OF THE ALLEGATION IN COURT MANAGEMENT SECTION OR EIGHTEENS IN ORDER TO REFORM THE STAFF COMPLETE PROCESS OF THE SELECTED PRISONS. WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS OF AMES IS IT'S DISTINCT SEPARATION FROM CDCR INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN OBJECTIVELY. OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS STAFF IN CHARGE OF STAFF COMPLETE INCREASE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT LOCATED WITHIN INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOCAL BUYERS CITY INFLUENCE FROM WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE STAFF THEY INVESTIGATE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY EXCESSIVE OR UNREPORTED INSTANCES OF USE OF FORCE STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST A PROTECTED CLASS RETALIATION DUE TO USE. OF THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. I THINK THE YOUR GENDER STRUCTURED WE'RE GOING TO ABOUT OUR NEXT WHICH AND AIMS BEFORE WE GET TO THE L. A- SWIPING TO TURN IT OVER TO. AMY MILLER. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- ANY MILLER DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH AN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT WITH CDC ARE. I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE OTHER PROPOSAL MENTIONED WHICH IS SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION. AND FORTY POSITIONS IN TWENTY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AN ON GOING TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE INVESTIGATION PROCESS FOR THE USE. OF FORCE AND PRESENT WRINKLE IN THE NATION AFTER ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF. CURRENTLY INQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AND ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF INMATES ARE CONDUCTED BY INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY STAFF. TRAINED TO COMPLETE THE INQUIRY IS. UNLESS THERE IS ALREADY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION OR IN THE CASE OF USE OF FORCE THERE IS SERIOUS BODILY INJURY DOCUMENTED. WHEN ASSIGNED THE INSTITUTION STAFF ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE THE IN CORY'S IN ADDITION TO THE REGULARLY ASSIGNED JOB DUTIES. REFERENCE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AND APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE. ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF INMATES SUBMITTED TO CDCR OFFICIALS. AS MENTIONED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WE RECEIVED FUNDING TO ESTABLISH THE ALLEGATION INCREMENTA TRANSECTION BUT THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THAT SECTION WAS CREATED TO SUPPORT THE GRIEVANCE AND APPEALS PROCESS. BY PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE INCREASE AND ALLEGATIONS MADE BY INMATES. HOWEVER DUE TO THE ROBUST INQUIRY PROCESSES AND ONGOING MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT THAT ALREADY EXISTED FOR CREATE AND USE OF FORCE ON THE CATIONS. CDC ARE EXCLUDED THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS FROM GOING TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL pTHERE WAS ALREADY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION OR THE USE OF FORCE RESULTED IN SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. THIS DECISION WAS MADE BECAUSE THE EXISTING PROCESSES ALREADY PROVIDED FOR SEVERAL LAYERS OF REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BOTH INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY BY WAY. OF THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. CDCR DOES HOLY RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS AND THE SENSITIVITY THAT SURROUND THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS AND HOW TROUBLING IT WOULD BE IF EVEN ONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IS NOT THOROUGHLY EXAMINED IN A FAIR AND ETHICAL MANNER. CITIES ARE ALSO KNOWS THE DEPARTMENT'S CREDIBILITY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY TO DO THAT DEMONSTRATE IN EVERY CASEAPPROPRIATE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO IDENTIFY. CORRECT AND HOLD STAFF ACCOUNTABLE WHEN MISCONDUCT IS SUSTAINED. AS MENTIONED THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AS DISTINCTLY SEPARATE FROM CDCR INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OBJECTIVELY INTO THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS. THIS INTENTIONAL SEPARATION MAKES INVESTIGATORS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO BIAS AND INFLUENCE. MOVING THE PROCESS FOR INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING USE OF FORCE STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THE STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AGAINST INMATES TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WILL ENHANCE THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS BY ENSURING THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED BY STAFF. WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS AND WHOSE SOLE JOB IS DOMESTICATE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. NO NO WITH THE L. A. L. AND MY COMMENTS PERTAIN TO ELEMENTS OF THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT RELATED TO STAFF MISCONDUCT ISSUES. THE FIRST ELEMENT IS THE PROCESS FOR HANDLING ANY EMPLOYEE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND THE SECOND RELATES TO BODY WORN CAMERAS SO MOVING INTO THE FIRST- WE FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE CHANGES- THE ENTIRE AS- STAFF MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION PROCESS- AT THE END ISSUE HERE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN- SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL RECEIVE HER YEAR AS WELL AS THE STAFF TIME. REQUIRED HER INVESTIGATION- PER CASE IS VERY UNCLEAR THIS IS BECAUSE THE DETAILS OF THE PROCESS ARE STILL SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION- AND I IN ONGOING LITIGATION. THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WERE USED TO FORM THE BASIS OF THAT WORKLOAD ESTIMATES FOR THE PROPOSALS. CAME FROM YEARS IN WHICH THE INMATE POPULATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN. IT IS NOW AND IS PROJECTED TO BE. I CDCR. HAS HAD THINK OF IN. THE TIME CURRENT. IN FACT IT INDICATES THAT- DRAMATICALLY UNDERESTIMATED THE TIME IT NEEDED IN ITS ORIGINAL NINETEEN TWENTY B. C. P. FOR THIS PROCESS. AND MOVE MORE OVERSEAS HERE HAS REPORTED THAT IT'S LOOKING FOR EFFICIENCIES TO REDUCE STAFF TIME PER INVESTIGATION SUCH AS USING VIDEO CONFERENCE TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS RATHER THAN HAVING STAFF TRAVEL TO INSTITUTIONS. BUT- SO AGAIN THAT DAY IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ARE FACTORED INTO THE TIME- THAT'S BEING BUDGETED FOR HERE. AND FINALLY WITH THE EXPANSION OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO MORE AND MORE PRESENTS WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A TIME FOR INVESTIGATION GO DOWN AS WELL BECAUSE IT SHOULD- PROVIDES. MORE CLEAR EVIDENCE WITH WHICH TO HANDLE THESE INVESTIGATIONS. SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING BOTH THE TOTAL THE NINETEEN MILLION AUGMENTATION BEING REQUESTED THROUGH THIS PACKAGE FOR THIS NEW PROCESS AS WELL AS THE BASE NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION I'M- FUNDING THAT WAS APPROVED IN NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS BECAUSE THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND SUBMIT A NEW REQUEST FOR RESOURCES FOR THAT- FOR THE PROCESS. FOR THE PROGRAM AFTER IT HAS DATA FROM ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING- THE PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PROCESSOR THE PLANNED PROCESS- WHICH WILL STRAIGHTEN ABLE IT'S MORE ACCURATELY ASSESSES. REESE NEEDS AND JUSTIFY THE TO THE LETTER. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT AND THAT LED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REGULARLY ASSESS THEIR DIFFERENT- RESEARCH NEEDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND COULDN'T. COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE FUNDING BUT THAT WOULD BE- AT THEIR DISCRETION AND THERE IS NO THAT SO. THE LARGEST ALLOWING FOR THEM TO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE DOESN'T PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OVER RESOURCES FOR THIS- PROPOSAL WHICH AND WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. S SOON SO THAT IS AND THAT IS WHAT I RECOMMEND. RECOMMENDATION IS GEARED TOWARD TOWARD. THANK YOU- AND THEN START MOVING ON TO BODY CAMERAS MAKES THE SECOND ELEMENT THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP HERE- WE RECKON WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING BECAUSE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PRESENT TO A COURT ORDER. BUT AND GIVEN TEACHER LIMITED EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTING BODY WORN CAMERAS AND THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND LIMITED USE OF THEM IN CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS. NATIONWIDE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF BODY WORN. CAMERAS BY AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER. THANK YOU. THIS IS THANK YOU IT TO PART OF FINANCE JUST WANNA RESPOND OF MY COMMENTS TO THE FIRST TO SEE IF THERE IS MONITORING. THE LADY THIS YEAR AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING DATA AND GIVEN THAT THAT I CAN WRITE THAT BODY WORN CAMERAS WERE ROLLED OUT ON A PILOT BASIS PURSUANT TO THE WORK ORDER AND WE'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF HOW TO BEST PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ADDITIONALLY I WOULD NOTE AND WITH REGARD TO THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION STAFFING THE MINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT NAY THAT LIMITED TERM RESOURCES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM AND IT IS DOUBTLESS THAT RECRUITING FOR A LIMITED TERM POSITION. AND IS I CAN BE CHALLENGING AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SET UP TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THAT THE CRITICAL ROLE AND FUNCTION THAT PERFORMS- WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION I'M IN WHICH IS UNDERSCORE THAT THAT IMPLEMENTATION YES- WE WANT TO SET THIS PROGRAM UP TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIAL BOTH TO MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COURT ORDER I'M AND AS WELL AS KIND OF ADDRESSING CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AT A PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE I'M A CONVERSATIONS OR- THIS YEAR AND THEN UP. ON GOING RE WHICH NOTE VERY SAID DID NOT THE OPERA TO PROGRAM STAFFING LOW ARE AND POINT IN I'M AND CITIES HAS NAY KIND OF COMMITMENTS TO KEEP THE WHAT INFORMED OF PROGRESS AS IT RELATES TO THE M. PROGRAM AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO RICK OF THE TIMES. I WHICH ARE AT APPROVED. HI THANK THANK YOU FOR THE I AM. HAVE A QUESTION A THREE I HAVE A CALL PER- SO I DO A PRE THAT FROM OUR OR YOUR FROM NOW SEE THE THING R. HAS BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE- THEY DIFFER. OF A THE STAFF PLANT OUT THERE BUT- WE STILL. SOME WORK TO DO. BOTH OUR COLLEAGUES HERE AT AND OUR HOUSE WANT TO MAKE WE HAVE SOME THAT'S- OBJECTIVE OUT THERE AND WE DO AS MUCH AS THEY CAN REMOVE THIS. OF THE PROCESS IS JUST WITH BIGGEST CONCERN. WITH THE PRICE THAT WE HAD OUT THERE BIRTH COMPLAINTS. SO DECIDED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE- AND YOU JUST YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AIM HERE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE CITIES IS TO BE HAVING EVERYTHING LOOKS OF GREEN. I PROCESS BY THE OF THE OF. IS THAT ACCURATE. THIS IS NOT HERE TRYING TO FINANCE I WANTED TO MAKE. I'M FROM SEATS THAT WILL BE TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. MATT AND- AMY MILLER SO. IN THE ARMS COMPRO. THE AT THE. HE MET BHASKAR THAT WE'RE WORKING TO IS THAT ALL GRAY WERE GO. THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS TO ESCROW NIT IN TO BE REVIEWED TO IF IT MEETS CRITERIA AS AND NOW OF STAFF. WE ALSO COMMITTED IN A HERE THAT THE WE WILL BE MOVED FORWARD WITH MAKING THAT A STATE WIDE PROCESS ALTHOUGH WE'RE STILL OUT THE FOR THAT. THANK YOU THAT IS ONE OF MY- WITH OR NOT THIS BE STATE WITNESS HER RECEIVED ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT THE- AND STILL. SO IT THE RATIONAL OF THE WILL SEND EVERYTHING OUT THERE IS THAT- STAFF IS. SCREENING OUT BALLOT COME. THAT'S CORRECT. AND SO IN DOING THAT THE STILL DO TO THE A- OF COURSE THE- FOR THE PROCESS. THE V. I. IN MINTS THAT IS BEING AREA THAT COME THE SCREENING UNIT ACTUALLY BE THEY WHERE THOSE ALLOCATE COME IN AND THAT ARE ALL THE GRIEVANCE WOULD COME AND THEN THEY WOULD THAT. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S ROUTE DOES INCLUDE ALLOCATE OF STAFF IN NEEDS TO BACK TO INSTANT TO BE ANSWERED OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THAT INCLUDE ALEC OF STAFF MISTER. AND THEREFORE NEEDS TO BE FORWARDED TO THE OFFICE INTERNAL. SO THAT AIMS CONTINUES TO ACCESS IT WOULD JUST BE THE SECOND STP. THAT WOULD THAT'S CORRECT MADAM CHAIR. QUESTION FOR MICHAEL MISTER JONES SAWYER. ACTUALLY JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WILL A BENEFIT BOTH THE- CDC ARE AND IT'S A- AN INMATE- AND I HEARD A OF STAFF. S. CONDUCT BUT I'VE I THINK HAVING NOT VIDEO. AND BY CAMERA WILL ALSO IS A- INMATE MISSED THAT WE IDENTIFY. AND IN BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT APPS HAPPENED. IN FACT I WOULD LOVE HAVE EVERYONE NCDC ARE HAVE CAN. AND THAT WE HAVE SIX CAMERAS IN THE MOST OF- MANNER. MY QUESTION IS A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE DO THESE ANALYSIS ESPECIALLY WITH WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. WE NEVER LOOK AT COSTA BOY. I NOTICED HARD TO THE CAP BUT SOMETIMES A NOT- ONE MISCONDUCT. MIGHT IN- LOCKDOWN. SERVER REPORTS HAVE TO BE RE. ON ON A STAFF. IT HAS TO IN SO. IN ADDITION WITNESS NEED TO BE. OUR INTERNAL AFFAIRS COULD BE INVOLVED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD BE INVOLVED IF YOU COULD GO OUT TO DEPARTMENT TO THE AG STATE AG DOJ'S OFFICE IT COULD BE A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION DOJ. AND OF COURSE A GOOD BE SEVERAL. AS OPPOSED TO US JUST GOING TO THE CAMERA AND LOOKING AT THE VIDEO AND THEN WE'RE DONE. AND SO. I WE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT CALCULATING THE COST OF BOYKIN'S OF PUTTING THESE CAMERAS AND BODY CAMERAS ON ON INDIVIDUALS AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD SAVE JUST ON ONE. ALLEGATION WHETHER TRUE OR NOT THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT WE PUT IN TO DOING THAT AND THE FACT THAT WE COULD SAVE. SAVE MONEY UP IN ADDITION I HAVE A IN MY OTHER QUESTION IS I JUST HAVE A- I HAVE A OF A- PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNAL FAIR AFFAIRS PROCESS YOU YOU MENTION EVERYTHING GOING TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND I BELIEVE IT AFTER IT LEAVES THERE GOES TOWARDS- IT DOES THIS THIS PROCESS WILL NOT GO TOWARDS. OKAY I GOT MY QUESTION ANSWERED. THE L. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD ASK THAT SO- IF IT IS TO TRY TO BE IN A- OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IT WOULD. GO TO THE OFFICE VENTURE AFFAIR WHERE AND- WOULD BE COMPLETED. AND THEN ONCE THAT INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE IT WOULD THEN BE ROUTED BACK TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY AND SO IN THE- EVENT THAT SET AN INMATE ALLEGATION WOULD GO BACK TO THE WARD AND- WHERE THE DISCIPLINE. WOULD CONTINUE BUT THAT INVESTIGATIVE REPORT WOULD BE COMPLETE AND WOULD HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT HE HIRING AUTHORITY NEEDS TO MAKE A JUDGMENT. ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE REPORT. SHOPE WARDEN. DON'T WANT THIS IN. TO GET OUT. A MAIN GET OUT OF THE HIRING ORGANIZATION. HOW IT GET TO THE SET HAD TO GET BACK TO US THAT THERE'S X. AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS GOING ON TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL PROCESS. THE THIRD ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION ARE JUST EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE PROCESS IS MONITORED BY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THEY'VE ALSO BEEN GIVEN AUTHORITY- AND HAVE A THIRTY TWO MONITOR ARE- EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE PROCESS SO FROM THE POINT THAT IT'S IDENTIFIED AS AN ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT THROUGH THE POINT. THAT ANY DISCIPLINE IS TAKEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MONITOR THAT ENTIRE PROCESS. CAPE WILL. I'M GAY MIXED INFORMATION WILL WILL DIE CHECK ON THAT AND THEN. ON THE COST AVOIDANCE- BUT LET'S LET'S- IS THAT HAS THAT BEEN NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING IN TO JUSTIFY WHY WE NEED TO EXPAND THIS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN ON EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID I'M JUST BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU AS FAR AS CAMPUS CONCERNED AND SO UP IT SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO GET SOME JUSTIFICATION. TO DENY ONLY FINANCE MAYBE THE L. A. O. OF- HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND HOW COST EFFICIENT THIS WOULD BE FOR THE DEPARTMENT HAVE WE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT DOING SOME ANALYSIS LIKE THAT OR I THINK SOMEONE SAID THEY WANTED THEY WANTED ANALYSIS DONE WHAT WE WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR WAS DONOVAN OR OTHER PLACES. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY THAT OR HOW DO YOU. PLAN TO MOVE. WITH THESE EVALUATE. YES MEMBER- THOSE ARE GOOD. I THINK IT'S- ERIC'S WHY A AGAIN THE DID DIRECTOR OF THE OF FOR SERVICE. I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE WITH BODY CAMERAS IS TOO NEW TO QUANTIFY WHAT THE SAVINGS WILL BE ALTHOUGH I THINK RATIONALLY WOULD ACCEPT YOU WOULD- BELIEVE THAT SAID THERE WOULD BE SAVINGS THAT WOULD OCCUR IN TERMS OF- THE A LENGTH OF INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING WE STANDING CAMERAS WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE BOB WE ARE WE TRIED IT ON A PILOT BASIS I DO AVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM D. A. R. R. MISTER SPEARMAN WHO CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT HE HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF SORT OF- SOME OF THE- BENEFITS. OF THAT CAMERA HAS BROUGHT CAMERAS ARE BROUGHT IN TERMS OF BOB WHEN THERE'S AN EXIT ON THE ARCTIC BE SOLVED A LOT SOONER- THEN- AND THEN HE SOAK I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CUT OF GO THROUGH ROUTE. ASSEMBLY WILL GO QUITE. THAT WAS MEANT A LOT IN A- WORKS IN A BEEN A- OF THE ACTUAL OFFENDER. A LOT OF TIMES BAR MY STAFF ABOUT HIGH. STATE PRISON SEEK TO PEOPLE AN ALTAR. EMPIRE TO BODY WORK. OF STAFFS TO OF. FIGHTING THEM THERE IS. OUR RULES. REPORTS AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING IS STAFFED THAT. IF YOU'RE READING A BOOK AND ANOTHER PERSON COMES UP AND ATTACKS THEM. AND THAT PERSON'S RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. IN A YOU KNOW- WE CAN MAKE SOME INFORMED DECISIONS ON IS THAT PARTY WITH THE VICTIM ISSUED A RULES VIOLATION REPORT. ALSO THAT IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER- BY MY COLLEAGUES JUST ONCE AND THAT THE MEDICATIONS WHAT WE THOUGHT SOMEBODY BROUGHT SOMETHING AN INSTITUTION LIKE A FLASHLIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THEY LOST IT. WE CAN RUN BACK BY OF. AUDIO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT. AND SEE IF THE PERSON DIDN'T BRING IT IN AND OUT AT THAT POINT EMPLOYEES CALL IN OUR FAMILY MEMBERS ONLY YOUR FLASHLIGHTS DIDN'T APPEAR ON THE NIGHT STAND WHERE IT IS. SO IT AVOID US HAVING TO. IMPACT THE PRESIDENT TO A MODIFIED PROGRAM AFFECT REHABILITATIVE. PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE IN ARGUE NO. SCHOOL ON THE SCHOOL COLLEGE OTHER ACTIVITY GROUPS. IT HELPS THAT WAY ALSO AGAIN AS YOU KNOW IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW BODY WORN CAMERAS IS A NEW TO THE CORRECTIONS. OUR DEPARTMENT AND IS A FEW DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE BODY WORN CAMERAS PLACED A NEW TECHNOLOGY. YES THE WE THINK AS A BENEFIT OF ALLOWING US TO LOOK AT THE SIX PRISONERS THE FIVE NEW PRISONS AND R. J. D. N A WE CAN DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE. AND COULD THEY SAVE US MONEY AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS. BUT PRETTY MUCH SO WE KNOW WE HAVE ALLEGATIONS WHAT SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHINGS SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING TO ME PROVOKED HIM TO. BUY LET'S TALK ABOUT. IT VENDOR SAYING ON A STAFF MEMBER DIDN'T THAT. BOTH WITH THE AUDIO BILLS OFFENSE WE'RE GONNA BE TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID PRIOR TO SOMETHING OCCURRING. SO CAN IS THAT. STAGES WHAT WE TAKE THIS AS A CHALLENGE WITH THESE. PER TO LOOK THE IF. AND SEE DOES BODY WORN CAMERAS COMPLEMENT OUR FIX. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. OR IS IT SOMETHING ARE FIT CAMERA. COVER THINGS FOR US AND WE NEED BY CAMERAS WALKED DETERMINE AS WE ADVISE WITH THE USE OF THEM AND COUPLE YEAR. OKAY I CAN HELP YOU GET THE DONE COULD. IN AND JUST AN FYI. THE AYE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE THOSE. UNDERFUNDED PROBABLY ONLY HAVE THREE PEOPLE O LOOK AT ALL THESE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS SO- THEY MAY NOT BE- EQUIPPED RIGHT NOW UNLESS WE GIVE THEM MORE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO. HANDLE THE BY YOUR BED THAT COMES IN SO- WE'VE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE. SLATE AND PLATE OF. THE WAY WE HANDLE- STAFF AN INMATE MISCONDUCT. THANK YOU. IT WILL. MISTER LUCKY YEAH I JUST HAVE A REALLY QUICK QUESTION ON THE- THE POLICIES. RELATED TO- THESE BODY CAMERAS AND FOR EXAMPLE THE RETENTION. CIRCUMSTANCES HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO RETAIN THE RECORDS OF- THESE THESE CAMERAS AND WHO'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE TO- TO RETAIN THEM AND WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS TO REVIEW THEM AND WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE FOR REVIEW. ARE THOSE- POLICIES AVAILABLE TO US. I WOULD TO FOR TO AYE TAMMY OR WHEN YOU THEIR TAMMY. OKAY WHAT I CAN SPEAK ON A- AT TAKE MYSELF OFF ME I'M AS FAR AS THE POLICIES- GO AROUND TRIGGERING EVENTS WHEN THEY'RE VIEWED I'LL LET MR SPEARMAN REFER TO THAT I'M I'M CAME HERE WHEN AND SECTION CHIEF- AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONTRABAND. INTERDICTION AND SAFETY SOLUTIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I'M WE ARE RETAINING VIDEO ACCORDING TO WE HAVE POLICY WHERE THERE IS A NINETY DAY RETENTION POLICY FOR ALL VIDEO I'M WHEN THERE IS A pTHEN STORED FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND AS IT PERTAINS TO THE COURT ORDER PROCESS- AND THOSE EVENTS THAT ARE- THAT INCLUDES- THE CLASS MEMBERS THAT THAT VIDEO IS STORED- INDEFINITELY. WE DO HAVE- A COMPLEMENT OF I. T. STAFF- THAT SUPPORT- LOCALLY PROVIDED ONE CAMERAS- AND- THEY ALSO ASSIST ON THE FIXED CAMERAS ALONG WITH OUR PLANT OPERATIONS STAFF AND- WE HAVE IT STAFF AT HEADQUARTERS. I'M AND THEN THERE IS ALSO. A COMPLEMENT OF THE OUR CORRECTIONAL STAFF AT THE INSTITUTIONS IN THE INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT- THAT SUPPORT AND- EIGHT THE INSTITUTION AND ITS EVALUATION AND- EXTRACTED VIDEO OR- STATING VIDEO. AND WHEN IT'S NECESSARY AND. ALL THAT MR SPEARMAN SPEAK TO THAT. SO IT TRIGGERING EVENTS IT OUT SHE WITH YOU IS A BUSINESS PLOY USED FORCE- IF THERE'S A RIOT- IF THERE'S A PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT ALLEGATIONS- IN ABOUT PLOY MISCONDUCT. OR MISCONDUCT THAT SOMEONE GETS INJURED WE EVEN LOOK AT SOMEONE SAYS THEY SLIPPED AND FELL LET SOMEBODY GET INJURED WE CAN LOOK AT THE CAMERAS AND SEE YOU KNOW FOR WORKMAN'SCOMP PURPOSES THERE. SO THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES BY THE FACT WHEN THERE'S AN INCIDENT INVOLVED WERE STAFF USE FORCE EXPRESSLY THEIR. WILL WRITE THEIR WRITTEN REPORTS. AND IF THERE IS CLARIFICATION ON THE USE OF FORCE. OR AFTER DEPLOYS SUBMIT AND SIGN IT TURN IN THEIR REPORT TO THEIR SERGEANT AND THEY WANT TO LOOK AT BODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE OR THEY WANT TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW FIX CAMERA FOOTAGE THEY CAN DO SO. UP SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THAT GOES THERE IF THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS DOING AN INVESTIGATION OF SOMEONE AMY STUDENTS DURING IN INVESTIGATION. AGAINST THE WHARTON GET SOME OUTSIDE PERSON SAYS SOMETHING IS HAPPENED ABOUT ONE THAT WOULD BE A TRIGGERING EVENT AND THEN WE WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE TIME FRAME OF WHAT THE PERSON THAT THE ACTUAL. EVENT TOOK PLACE FOR HIS ACTION REPORTABLE INCIDENT PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THAT IN IT IT COULD BE USED AS FAR AS YOU KNOW IN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN FOUND. DO SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE OR IT COULD EXONERATE SOMEBODY THAT WHAT WAS ALLEGED BACK WHEN I WAS AT HIGH DESERT BEFORE YEARS UP THERE AND PROBABLY THE LAST TWO AND A HALF I WAS AWARDED. WE HAD BALK AT WE HAD THAT PAGE CAMERAS A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE MADE ALLEGATIONS AGAINSTMY STAFF AND IT. IS A TRIGGERING EVENT WE LOOKED INTO IT AND A PERSONAL EXONERATING IN THAT THAT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE AT ALL AND THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE- I IS A HIGHER GET THE WOULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION OPEN TO INCLUDING DISMISSING SOMEONE. WHO YOU KNOW USED EXCESSIVE UNNECESSARY USE OF FORCE AGAINST AN OFFENDER AND I TOOK THE APPROPRIATE ACTION AND BESIDES WRITTEN REPORTS THAT THEY SUBMITTED AND OTHER EMPLOYEES ADMITTED I ALSO USED THE ERA. FIXED A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE TO PROVE AND TO SHOW YOU KNOW THEM FLOWY THERE ATTORNEY AND TO SHOW ALSO ADMINISTRATIVE. LAW JUDGE WHY TOOK THE ACTION. OKAY MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT ARE THE PARAMETER. BY WHICH OF THE CRY OFFICE HAVE TO HAVE THE- BODY CAMERAS ON. ARE THEY EVER PERMITTED TO TURN THEM OFF. YES THEY ARE GOING TO PERSON CHECKS OUT THEIR CAMERA- THEY TURNER CAMRON BUT OF COURSE IF SOMEONE. WAS USING THE RESTROOM THEY CAN TURN THE CAMERA OFF IF SOMEBODY'S HAVING EMPLOYMENT NEED- SOME TYPE OF- DIALOGUE WITH THE SUPERVISOR OR IF THEY'RE IN AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INTERVIEW THEY'LL BE DIRECTED BY THE SPECIAL AGENT TO TURN THE CAMERA OFF- IF SOMEONE'S INVOLVED IN SOME TYPE OF LABOR ORGANIZATION. DISCUSSION THOSE TIMES WHEN A PERSON COULD TURN A BODY WORN CAMERA OFF BUT OTHER THAN THAT. PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP THEIR CAMERAS ARE. OKAY YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION SOMEONE IN MOST CASES THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TURN THEM OFF UNLESS THAT MAKES ONE OF THOSE. CIRCUMSTANCES YOU JUST OUTLINED LIKE. YOU KNOW OF COURSE PERSONAL NEED NOT KIND OF THING. THAT IS CORRECT AND WE HAVE ACTUAL PROCEDURE ON IT AND EVERYBODY'S BEEN TRAINED ON THAT AT LEAST AT THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO WITH ACTIVATED BODY WORN CAMERAS I THINK JANUARY NINETEENTH. THEY'VE ALL BEEN TRAINED IT'S ALSO A PROCEDURE THAT'S OUT THERE FOR ALL STAFF TO KNOW WHEN THEY CAN AND CANNOT TURN THE CAMERAS ON. SOMETHING I WORK IN ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT MRS- WHEN THEIR KIDS WERE WORKING WITH THE VENDOR TO LOOK AT SOME SOFTWARE. JUST TO SEE BECAUSE WE CAN'T. WHAT WE BARGAIN WITH LABOR THAT WE CAN'T. LOOK AT CAMERAS TO SUPERVISE THEM THAT'S AGAINST YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT A MEMORANDUM UNDERSTANDING. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PUT PIC TRYING TO FIND SOME TYPE OF REPORT TO SHOW. IF I CAMERA SPOTS BEYOND ENACT WAS SAFE AND GET EXAMPLE IF THE AVERAGE IS A CAMERA SHOULD BE ON FOR WILL SAY SIX HOURS AND TEN MINUTES A DAY. BARRING SOMEONE USING THE BATHROOM AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GET SOME TYPE REPORTS WE CAN JUST KIND OF WAS LOOKING TO SEE OKAY THE AVERAGE FOR CAMERAS IS THAT. SO IT'S A PRESS THE CAMERA WAS ON PER HOUR AND TEN MINUTES BUT YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYEE WAS THERE FOR EIGHT HOURS. THAT WE CANNOT ALLOW US TO KIND OF LOOK TO SEE KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED IT COULD BE THAT THAT PERSON WENT HOME SICK. SO AGAIN WE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING. AT YOU KNOW WHEN THE CAMERA SHOULD BE ON AND OFF. AND MY LAST YOUR CALL. IF UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY THE NATURAL TATIAN A RETENTION OF THE RECORDED ACTIVITY IS NINETY DAYS UNLESS THERE'S A TRIGGERING EVENT. THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS MR LACKEY- I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOWN THE ROAD ON THE DATA- THAT FIRST TO LOOK AT. PEOPLE ARE BEING TRAINED WHEN THEY SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T TURN OFF THE CAMERA THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T JUST TURN IT OFF IF THEY WANT TO- AND FILL. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT YOU HAVE INCLUDING WHICH IS ASCRIBED TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE ONLY TURN THEM OFF WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY REALLY NEED TO FOR PERSONAL PURPOSES AND SO FORTH AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT UPDATE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ON THESE ITEMS. ALL RIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACT NEGOTIATING THAT INFORMATION ON THESE TWO ITEMS AS YOU COULD TELL US A LOT OF INTEREST FROM COMMITTEE THERE WAS SO MUCH INTEREST I SEE THAT WE SKIPPED I DON'T FIFTEEN. FROM THIS PANEL AND SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY. HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AN ALLEY- TALK ABOUT ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN. FOUR SEVENTY FRIENDS OIL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OUR SERVER ITEM FIFTEEN REPLACEMENT OF A DAY OF ROOM AND COMMON AREA FURNITURE TV STAR REQUEST ONE TIME RESOURCES OF THIRTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. IN ORDER TO PURCHASE AND REPLACE MODULAR FURNITURE- AGAIN FOR DAY ARMS ARE COMMON AREAS- ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. TICKETS ARE RECOGNIZED IS THAT MUCH OF THE FURNITURE INSIDE ITS INSTITUTIONS THAT IS NOT EXACTLY CONDUCIVE TO FOSTERING A REHABILITATIVE ENVIRONMENT. AND CHANGING THE FURNITURE IN PLACES WHERE INCARCERATED PEOPLE SPEND A MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME INTO THEIR PROGRAMMING IS A SENSIBLE FIRST STEP TO A CHANGING THE TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. THE STAR WILL TARGETS DAY ROOMS AND COMMON AREAS AND AT NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITIES PROGRESSIVE OR POSITIVE PROGRAMMING FACILITIES AND FEMALE FACILITIES. AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. DEGREE FROM OUR- WITH THE L. A. M. ARE DATED THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO CREATE A PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S MORE CONDUCIVE TO REHABILITATION.HOWEVER CONCLUDED IT IS TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR FUTURE. ATION FOR EXAMPLE I COULD FOCUS ON INCLUDING ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR ALL INMATES I THANK PEOPLE APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC ARE REPORT ON WHETHER CLASS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ALL INMATES WITH ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAM. IF THE DOCTOR CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS THE CASE THAT. WOULD BE. HARD IT OTHERWISE IT MAY BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MEET THE REHABILITATION NEEDS OF INMATES. ROBIN BY FURNITURE. THANK EBONY FRETBOARD TO PARK OF FINANCE- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER A QUICK RESPONSE. TO THE L. A. O.'S CONCERNS. OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS FOR THE FURNITURE CHANGES TO BE A COMPLIMENT TO THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY OFFERED AT THE% INSTITUTIONS. SO IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S I THIS IS A REQUEST TO MAKE THAT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING MORE EFFECTIVE- AND THEN KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT OPT INTO THESE REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES- CESAR DOES OFFER QUITE A ROBUST REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM. TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER. THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT I GUESS AS- K. TWO PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT CHANGING THE CULTURE AND- DOING BETTER AND REHABILITATION AND LOOKING AT AT THE NORWAY MODEL OF FOR EXAMPLE I GUESS IT'S UST A QUESTION THIS IS AN AND WHILE THESE THINGS ARE COMPLIMENTARY IT'S TO WE INVEST IN THIS NOW OR IS THIS SOMETHING. THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN FIRST OR AT THE SAME TIME BEFORE WE DO THIS FURNITURE PURCHASE. MISTER LACKING I JUST HAVE A QUESTION THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SEEMS LIKE A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY. FOR FURNITURE. I THINK IT IS. YES THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SEEMS LIKE A VERY BIG PURCHASE FOR FURNITURE AND I'M I'M JUST. TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE JUSTIFICATION. OF FOR THAT HIGH PRICE TAG AND I HEARD WHAT YOU JUST SAID BUT DON'T WE GET DESERVE A BIT MORE DETAIL. A JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT- THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. BEAR OUR NUMBER OF ROOMS THAT AND TABLES IN THESE FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE SO THAT I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG NUMBER BUT IT DOES ADD UP PRETTY QUICKLY EVEN THOUGH THE- INDIVIDUAL UNITS MAY NOT BE. THAT EXPENSIVE- BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY TO DEFERRED TO ERIC'S ONCE AND ACTIVISTS ARE HE MAYBE MAYBE I COULD CLEAR BY MY QUESTION. LAKE WHERE HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THIS NUMBER. I MEAN HOW MANY IS THIS JUST LIKE A. A POCKET GAS. OR I'M I'M JUST NOT TRYING TO GET SOME MORE JUSTIFICATION AS TO HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT'S THAT GONNA BY. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS A ERIC SWANSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. WE CAN PROVIDE YOU AND YOUR STAFF A- SORT OF A BREAKDOWN OF HOW WE GOT TO THAT AMOUNT SAYS- MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED IT IS THE NUMBER OF. ROOMS WERE TRYING TO COVER AND IT'S ACROSS- THIRTY TWO INSTITUTIONS- SO IT DOES ADD UP QUICKLY BUT FOR SURE WE CAN BREAK DOWN FOR YOU HOW WE GOT TO. GET TO MILLION DOLLARS FOR EVERY INSTITUTION SO. I MEAN THAT'S A LOT OF FURNITURE THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH QUALITY FURNITURE LIVE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO. ALL I'M TRYING TO GET IS A LITTLE- BETTER DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THAT PURCHASE MAY BE SO I CAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. I THINK THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WOULD FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THAT AS WELL. I DO APPRECIATE THE QUICK MATH OF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A- PURPOSE AND FOR SOME OF THESE ROOMS AND SO I DO THINK THAT THAT RAISE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- AS WELL IN ADDITION TO YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE PARA TASTING AND IN THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE BUT- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUICK MATHA. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND SO WILL LEAD TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO US THAT DOWN THE ROAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- WITH THAT WE HAVENO MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS PANEL. AND SO WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER EIGHT. LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY. IT EVENING JUST NAME AND ARE GONNA FINANCE THAT FIRST REQUEST AND LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY IS.

AND THE FINE COLLECTION REDUCTIONS EMANATING FROM CO THAT WE WERE CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT THEM AND CARRIED OF BUDGET ON MEDICATIONS WHICH WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAIN REVISED PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO THE ABILITY OF THE COURT THE FUNCTION POST PANDEMIC.

FINALLY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PRE TRIAL RELEASE PROGRAM EXPANSION AND FUNDING AUGMENTATION AND ALL THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID ALTHOUGH WE ONCE AGAIN CONCUR WITH WESTERN CENTER THAT WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WILL ENHANCE IT TO THE TUNE OF AN ADDITIONAL. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK AND NEXT ABOUT THE LINE OF ONE SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD EVENING KAREN MEMBERS SCRIPTED THE BOOK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WANT TO SPEAK TO THE PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN VICTIM SERVICES FUNDING DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE INCLUDED IN MAYBE FIVE. MONDAY IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE KLEINS IN THE FEDERAL- FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PROGRAM HOWEVER WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT SIGNIFICANTLY A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL PROVIDE FOR GREATER STABILITY AS THE FEDERAL PROCESS FOR FIXING THE CAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN FEDERAL FUNDING IS LIKELY TAKE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME OVER MULTIPLE FISCAL YEAR. AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING SITUATION MAY FURTHER DETERIORATE REQUIRING A GREATER BACK WELL- I WILL ALSO ADD ON THE THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT SHOULD BE FEDERAL OUTLOOK IMPROVED AT A GREATER SPEED THAN ME IN COURT THAT HE- ANY ADDITIONAL REVENUE THE STATE HAS ALLOCATED YOU SPECTRUM SERVICE AND- THEY HAVE OF THE STATE THE PROGRAM. TO BE ABLE TO AUGMENT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME ANAHEIM GLAD THAT DEMAND. FOR SERVICE IF. FIVE REALLY APPRECIATE THE MAY REVISE AND COURAGE BUDGET Q.

AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE CONSIDERING INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA OF LAW THANK YOU. THANK YOU AN EXTRA GO O LINE OF FIFTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI MICHELLE WELL JUSTICE LA HI. ASK THAT THIS BODY REJECT THE GOVERNOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY BILLION PROPOSED SPENDING ON PROBATION BY PRE TRIAL PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND SPENDING ON BOTH THAT COMMUNITY BASED PRE TRIAL SERVICES WHICH DO YOU HAVE A PRUDENT RECORD OF SUPPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RETURN TO COURT HERE AND ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES AND CONSERVATION IT'S FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO EXPAND PILOTS BUT LACKS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF EFFECTIVENESS QUALITY REVIEW. AND LONGER TERM BENEFIT ADDITIONALLY THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A BASIC WEBSITE PROVIDED BY OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE BUDGET BY THREE O'CLOCK THAT MANDATE THE GOVERNOR TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION PROPOSED SPENDING ON PROBATION LEAD PRE TRIAL PROGRAM. IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE FUNDAMENTAL TENETS IN A SENSE AND THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHO REJECTED PROP TWENTY FIVE THE PILOT PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE SYSTEM PROPOSED BY PROP TWENTY FIVE WHICH USED A BIAS RISK RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND UNCHECKED POWER TO PROBATION DEPARTMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPERVISION OF LEGALLY INNOCENT PEOPLE COMPROMISES THEIR RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND PERPETUATED OVER INCARCERATION AFTER THE BODY REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION PROPOSED SPENDING ON PROBATION BLOOD PRE TRIAL. PROGRAMS ADDITIONALLY BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY I SUPPORT THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND I FULLY SUPPORT THE CLOSING OF ALL PEOPLE CALIFORNIA PRISON. SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY CAJUN CALIFORNIA ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR DISCUSS TODAY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THROUGH. THAT LENS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ENEC SO I OF THIRTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME HE BACKED AWAY I'M WITH DIGNITY AND POWER NOW AN ORGANIZATION BASED HERE IN LOS ANGELES PART OF THE CAREFIRST CALIFORNIA COALITION. AND I WILL ALSO WANT TO VOICE CONCERN OVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR UP SPENDING ON THE PROBATION THAT PRE TRIAL TRIAL LET'S PUT UP BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HERE IN LOS ANGELES WE WERE ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT RECEIVED THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE PRE TRIAL THAILAND. AND WHAT HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY CONCERNING IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE EFFICACY OF THE PRE TRIAL PILOT WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A PROBATION DEPARTMENT THROUGH A PR A REQUEST. AND WE THE RESULTS WERE INCREDIBLY DISTURBING UPWARDS OF 97% OF THOSE THAT WERE RELEASED ON MISDEMEANORS NOT FELONIES MISDEMEANOR CHARGES WERE PLACED ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT CONTINUING TO FIND PROBATION DEPARTMENT SUPERVISION OF BOOKS THAT ARE LEGALLY INNOCENT LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED. WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING WHICH IS COSTLY FOR COUNTIES AND COSTLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT ARE PLACED ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING WHAT WE REALLY NEED FOR AN ALLEY COUNTY AND I WOULD SAY ACROSS THE STATE IT'S FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED PRE TRIAL SERVICES. ALREADY MODELS IN THE STATE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT ARE USING A COMMUNITY BASED PRE TRIAL SERVICES MODEL WITH MUCH HIGHER EFFICACY RESULTS ARE WHAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS NEED ARCHITECT MESSAGE REMINDERS TRANSPORTATION TO COURT CHILD CARE THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS NEED THESE LIGHT TOUCH SERVICES. BUT THE LONGER THE THREE TOP FINALISTS ARE PUTTING SUPERVISION IN THE HANDS OF PROBATION OF LEGALLY INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY CREATING A REVOLVING DOOR BACK INTO INCARCERATIONS L. A. COUNTY IS THE LARGEST JAIL SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE NATION AND WHAT WE'RE DEVELOPING HERE IN L. A. COUNTY IS A DIFFERENT MODEL BASED ON ALTERNATIVES. TO INCARCERATION BASED ON THE- COMMITTEE BASED ON PER PROP FOR WITH THEIR BAY. NEW AND CHARGE TO. THAT STATE HAS YET INVEST IN TWELVE TO. THE WAY OUR IS MOVING A I REALLY ASK WITH TO CONSIDER A LINE. WITH THE MORE. ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION VISION THAT RESPECT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE OF. THE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE AND ALLOW FOR TRANSPARENCY. RIGHT NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO ASSESSMENT YET BY THE STATE AROUND- THE EFFICACY OF THE NEEDS PETROPOULOS NETWORK INVESTING ANOTHER. A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION AN EXTENSION ON THE THIRTEENTH LIKE A STEP TOO FAR TOO EARLY WE NEED THE RESULTS OF THE PRE TRIAL PILOT BEFORE ALLOCATING ANYMORE DOLLARS TO EXPAND. A MEASURE WHICH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY REJECTED- WE REJECTED CROP TWENTY FIVE YOU REJECTED IT BASED ON BY ITS RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT WE REJECTED ON THE BASIS OF THE BASEST OF EXPANDING THEIR POWER. AND FUNDING TO PROBATION DEPARTMENT. BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY SPOKEN AND IT WILL BE ENVISIONED SOMETHING. MORE PROTRACTED SOMETHING THAT REALLY ALIGNED WITH. THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT ABOUT THE LINE OF WITH TWENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI GOOD EVENING NINE ACCORDING AND BEEN CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CART SACRAMENTO IS PART OF THE CARE FOR COALITION I AFTER THAT BODY REJECTS. THE GOVERNOR OF A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED TO BE SPENT ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PROBATION MY PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS I DISAGREED. THAT THE PILOTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND HAVING MONITORED THE ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I DO NOT BELIEVE PROBATION SHOULD BE TRUSTED WITH LIBERTY BASED PRE TRIAL REFORM. WE NEED A MODEL THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. AND WE HAD BETTER MDELS OF OTHER CALLERS STATED LIKE AFFECT PRE TRIAL. EVEN OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS PROGRAM. SACRAMENTO I TELL ONE ONE CENTS WOULD. THAT'S BEEN MADE. WE WANT TO REINVEST DOLLARS FROM THE BLOATED BUDGETS OF BOTH CDC ARE IN PROBATION. IS A COMMUNITY BASED AND NEED BASED SYSTEM BUT ACTUALLY BREAK CYCLES OF CRIMINALIZATION. PROBATION AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN UNDER ITS TENTACLES OF A VERY HARMFUL AND FIFTY THAT TRAP PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SEND. IN QUIETER. WAYS FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. IT'S GONNA BE HARD. AND ELECT MONITORING PARTICULAR EXTREMELY CONCERNING ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE HUMPHREY DECISION THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL GET CALIFORNIANS A FALSE CHOICE OF EITHER. CASH BAIL OR PROBATION CONTROL. THE PROBATION OUR PROPOSAL OF ALSO IS AVAILABLE TO THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. PILOT FOR RESPONSE THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT STATES HAVE FOUND THAT VOTERS NOT DOWN APART TWENTY FIVE WE KNOCKED DOWN AND THE USE OF BIAS BUT GETS A- HOLD THAT BUT ALSO THE UNCHECKED POWER. GIVEN TO PROBATION DEPARTMENT SB TEN OR PROP TWENTY FIVE FOR THE PILOT MOTOR THAN THIRTEEN AFFECTING COUNTIES 81% WHO HAD THESE PROBATION LIKE PROGRAMS. PROTECTED PROPERTY BY THE WAY DEFINITELY WATCHABLE PRE TRIAL FOR THE CENTER COMMUNITY BASED. ON WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED BY AS ABI RICH. BUT WE ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF EUROPE ON ABILITY AND LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN- MONETARY YOU FOLLOWING PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HEARING. HARPSICHORDS RAPIDLY REDUCING BEAR PROJECT CONTINUING DOWN THE PATH RELATED TO PRESENT CLOSER PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING CURRENT PEOPLE PLAN FOR PRESIDENT CLOSER I AGREE THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER IN CHOOSING WHICH CURRENTLY PROPOSED FIRST. URBAN DEVELOP YOUR BASS CRITERIA FOR THAT SURVEYING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT RIGHT RECOMMENDED THE CLOSURE OF AT LEAST TEN OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. SO INCLINED PLEASE DO NOT EXPAND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROBATION PILOTS FORGET ANYTHING ARCH ANYMORE FUNDING WE DON'T NEED TO BUILD COMMUNITY LIKE ATMOSPHERE INSIDE PRESENCE. WE ARE LOVED ONES BACK.

GOOD AFTERNOON CLAN BACK FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE COALITION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED TO BE GIVEN TO THE COURT FOR FEED THAT. IS THAT THAT IS CURRENTLY ON COLLECTIBLE. IT WOULD BE A BILL RECORDS BUT IT WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WE'RE BURDENED BY THE STREET IT'S A FRACTION OF THE OVER EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING DEBT HANGING OVER FAMILIES. IT WOULD DO NOTHING TO STOP THE ACCRUAL OF NEW GET MOVING FORWARD. EVERYONE AGREED IT WAS NEVER RIGHT TO BALANCE COURT AND LOCAL BUDGETS. ON THE BACK OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF COLOR. WITH THE INFLUX OF FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE HIGHER REVENUE THAN EXPECTED NOW IS THE TIME TO FIX THIS RACIST AND REGRESSIVE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OUTSTANDING TAX LEVIED ON THOSE WHO ARE RATCHETING CARTER YOU'RE PUT ON PROBATION SHOULD BE FORGIVEN AND ALL THE FEES REPEALED INCLUDING CIVIL FAST. THE GREATER MILLION SHOULD BE REDIRECTED TO THE REPEAL OF CIVIL ASSESSMENT AND GUESTS AT YOUR FEET AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
