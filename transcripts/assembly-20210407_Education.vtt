LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL LEVEL

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:17.086
DATA. AND ONLY IN THE CONTEXT

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:17.687

HARD ON THIS SO I LOOK FORWARD.

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:14.415
TO THE TIME WHEN WE PRESENT

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:16.417
INFORMATION. WHETHER IT'S

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:18.152
UPDATED INFORMATION AS WE KNOW

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:21.055
EVEN AS TEACHERS OR TEXTBOOKS

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.890
OVER THE YEARS HAVE CHANGED IN

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.091
THE VAULT AS WE GET NEW

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:26.360
INFORMATION AND HISTORY IS AN

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.829
IMPORTANT PART OF EDUCATION. SO

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:32.800
I'D REALLY NOT ONLY SUPPORT

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:35.135
THIS BUT I. ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.604
BE OPEN ABOUT THIS EDUCATION IS

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:40.507
SIMPLY ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.543
LEARN INFORMATION AND THEN

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.578
THOSE PEOPLE THAT LEARN IT CAN

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.046
STILL HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:48.082
ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE

01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:49.183
INFORMATION THAT'S PRESENTED TO

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:51.151
THEM. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

TIRELESSLY THANK YOU. THANK

01:39:56.090 --> 01:40:00.861
YOU- MR KILEY. I YEAH YOU KNOW

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.763
I DON'T DOUBT THAT THERE IS-

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.465
GREAT VALUE IN IN MANY OF THE

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.466
THINGS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT IN

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.700
SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA RIGHT

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:09.903
NOW- IN ELECTIVES- THAT GO BY

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:10.938
THE NAME OF EXPECTING STUDIES

01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:13.640
OR- OR RELATED TOPICS AND- TO

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.876
THE AUTHOR I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:17.511
DOUBT THAT YOUR GOAL. IS TO.

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.780
REMOTE HEALING AND

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.449
UNDERSTANDING AND EMPOWERMENT-

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:27.688
BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT. THIS

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:30.023
CURRICULUM AS- IT'S BEEN

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.825
DEVELOPED AS IT'S BEEN ADOPTED

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:34.194
IS NOW WE WOULD. UPPER PORTER

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.131
REQUIRE IT. DOES THE OPPOSITE

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:39.233
AND- THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:41.368
BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.737
OF THE PROCESS. YOU HAD VARIOUS

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.573
GROUPS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.941
AND SAID WE FEEL TARGETED BY

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:50.043
THIS. WE FEEL LIKE THIS

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.446
CURRICULUM IS CASTING US IN OUR

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.381
HISTORY. AND OUR CULTURE. AND

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:56.250
OUR BELIEFS AND OUR COMMUNITY.

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:57.951
IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT YOU KNOW

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:00.154
I'LL THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS-

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.356
THE- CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:05.225
JEWISH CAUCUS- I THINK THE

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:07.094
DOZEN OR SO LEGISLATORS FROM

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.263
THIS- THIS LEGISLATURE. PUT OUT

01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:12.199
A LETTER SAYING THAT THIS

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:12.966
ECHOES THE PROPAGANDA OF ****

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:14.902
GERMANY. AND EVEN WITH THE

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:16.804
REVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.806
YOU STILL HAVE FOLKS IN THE

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:19.440
JEWISH COMMUNITY ASIAN AMERICAN

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.108
COMMUNITY. AND MANY OTHER

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.309
COMMUNITIES WILL COME FORWARD

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:23.076
TO THIS DOESN'T BUILD

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:23.911
UNDERSTANDING THIS DOESN'T

01:41:23.977 --> 01:41:25.979
BUILD BRIDGES THIS STOKES

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:29.483
DIVISION AND- AND RESENTMENT.

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.385
AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:34.388
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW. WITH

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:37.224
THE FIRST DRAFT. DID NOT LEND

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.426
THEMSELVES TO SORT OF. SERVICE

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.062
LEVEL DIVISIONS BUT WERE REALLY

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:45.132
AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE WAY

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:47.267
THIS WHOLE THING. HAS BEEN

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:51.438
CONCEIVED SO I SIMPLY DO NOT

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.373
THINK THAT WHEN WE HAVE A

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.943
CURRICULUM THAT IS. INSPIRING

01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.212
THAT KIND OF DIVISION IT'S

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:01.782
APPROPRIATE AT ALL- FOR US TO.

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.617
FORCE EVERY STUDENT IN

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.386
CALIFORNIA- TED TO TAKE IT AND

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:07.721
THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.923
POINT THAT EVEN IF. WE DIDN'T

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.092
THINK THAT THIS CURRICULUM WAS

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:13.861
READY FOR THE CLASSROOM IN

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:16.129
SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT IS

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:18.832
AN ENORMOUS LEAP FROM THAT TO

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:19.333
SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE A

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:21.068
GRADUATION REQUIREMENT- THERE

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.269
ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE OF

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.071
VALUE- THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT AS

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:26.039
ELECTIVES ACROSS CALIFORNIA C.

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:29.009
T. MANY OTHER. TYPES OF COURSES

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:29.910
AND SO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.112
HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF THE NEEDS

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:33.780
TO BE MET THE STATE OF THIS NOW

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:35.916
SUDDENLY I NEED TO BE REQUIRED

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:38.452
ESPECIALLY WHEN AS ONE OF THE

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.387
WITNESS NOTED WE HAVE SOME OF

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.955
THE WORST EDUCATION OUTCOMES IN

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.357
CALIFORNIA OF ANY STATE IN THE

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:45.626
