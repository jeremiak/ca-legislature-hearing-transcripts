FROM A HANDOUT THAT WAS JUST

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:28.967 region:rollup2
PASSED OUT TO YOU. BUT SO WE

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:31.069 region:rollup2
HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:32.838 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S FOR FISCAL PROPOSALS

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:33.639 region:rollup2
REGARDING LCF OF BUT WE DO THINK

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:36.208 region:rollup2
THAT THIS.

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:38.343 region:rollup2
MELISSA MOMENT OF.

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:40.746 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY ACHIEVING FULL

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:41.713 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LC A FIVE.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:42.981 region:rollup2
OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:45.550 region:rollup2
STATE TO ENGAGE IN A

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:46.551 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT WAS

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.253 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY CHANGE THAT WE MADE

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:51.089 region:rollup2
IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN ONE FAX HAS

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
IT HAD ON SCHOOL FINANCE? AND

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:54.726 region:rollup2
WHAT CHANGES CAN WE MAKE GOING

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:57.062 region:rollup2
FORWARD. ON THE FIRST PAGE OF

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:59.598 region:rollup2
THIS HANDOUT WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:29:57.062 --> 00:30:00.699 region:rollup2
MOST BASIC ELEMENTS OF LC FF

00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:02.868 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE.

00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:05.103 region:rollup2
A BASED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING

00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:08.707 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFFERED TO EVERY SCHOOL

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:09.174 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ACCORDING TO THESE FOUR

00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:11.043 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GRADE SPEND

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:11.643 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:13.078 region:rollup2
AND THE CENTRAL QUESTION HERE

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.112 region:rollup2
IS.

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:15.614 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE'RE REACHING FULL

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:16.348 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OR REACHING THE

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:18.350 region:rollup2
STATUTORY.

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:19.384 region:rollup2
BASEBAND RATES.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.254 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THESE RATES HOW WHERE

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:22.888 region:rollup2
THEY SAID?

00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:23.488 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE STEPS

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:25.357 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TAKEN AT THIRTEEN

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:27.492 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN FIRST WE STARTED WITH

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:29.328 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE. OF THE AVERAGE

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:31.330 region:rollup2
GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING AMOUNTS

00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:32.931 region:rollup2
PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.166 region:rollup2
GRADES SPANS.

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:36.068 region:rollup2
THEY AND THE PRE RECESSION ERA

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:38.670 region:rollup2
SO WE RESTORED THE CUTS THAT

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:40.372 region:rollup2
WERE MADE DURING THE RECESSION

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.606 region:rollup2
WE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. THAT

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:43.241 region:rollup2
WAS OUR STARTING POINT.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.076 region:rollup2
I TO WE ADJUSTED EACH OF THOSE

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.610 region:rollup2
UPWARDS BY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:47.546 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.980 region:rollup2
ESTO BROWN NUMBER.

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:51.049 region:rollup2
AND THEN THREE WE MADE

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.851 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:55.020 region:rollup2
TO AT THE BASE RATES TO THE K.

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:55.954 region:rollup2
THREE BASE RATE AND TO THE HIGH

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.290 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BATES RATE THOSE VERSES

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:59.758 region:rollup2
FOR SPECIFIC POLICY PURPOSES.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.993 region:rollup2
IT WAS TO SUPPORT CLASS SIZE

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:03.762 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN THE EARLIER GRADES

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:05.764 region:rollup2
INTO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:07.833 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:09.167 region:rollup2
NOW THIS IS ALL THE SAY THAT.

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:11.603 region:rollup2
.

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:12.204 region:rollup2
WHEN ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:14.306 region:rollup2
ARE THESE BASE RATES HOW WERE

00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:16.475 region:rollup2
THEY SAID. THAT IT WAS A VERY AD

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:18.043 region:rollup2
HOC PROCESS IT WAS NOT INTENDED

00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:19.444 region:rollup2
TO REPRESENT THE STATE'S FINAL

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:21.580 region:rollup2
ANSWER ON THIS IS THE

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:22.681 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL. FOR

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.650 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THESE WERE

00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:26.752 region:rollup2
MODERATELY AMBITIOUS TARGETS AND

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.787 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE'VE REACHED THEM WE

00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:30.355 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REVISIT THE QUESTION OF.

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:34.559 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:34.559 region:rollup2
FUNDING LA AMOUNT TO WHAT IS THE

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:38.096 region:rollup2
PURPOSE VERSUS TARGETED FUNDING.

00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:39.164 region:rollup2
DOWN THE TARGETED FUNDING

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:40.732 region:rollup2
QUESTION WE WE CAN DEAL WITH

00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:42.000 region:rollup2
THAT ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.401 region:rollup2
HANDOUT.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.404 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:47.506 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS IN MANY

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:48.774 region:rollup2
WAYS THESE WERE LCF APPS

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:50.442 region:rollup2
PROPOSED SUCCESSOR TO THE

00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:52.511 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT WAS

00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:54.613 region:rollup2
PROVIDED. UNDER THE PREVIOUS

00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:55.747 region:rollup2
FINANCE SYSTEM BUT THEY DIFFER

00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:57.549 region:rollup2
FROM THAT CATEGORICAL FUNDING IN

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:58.784 region:rollup2
TWO IMPORTANT WAYS.

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:00.352 region:rollup2
BUT THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S

00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:01.486 region:rollup2
NOTABLY LARGER THAN THE

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:03.588 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT WAS

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:05.390 region:rollup2
ROLLED AND IF IF YOU TAKE ALL OF

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:07.592 region:rollup2
A CAN CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.361 region:rollup2
WERE ROLLED INTEL CFF. YOU JUST

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.529 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING FOR INFLATION.

00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:12.297 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:13.965 region:rollup2
LESS THAN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:15.700 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ROLLED IN. A THE ACTUAL

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:17.302 region:rollup2
VALUE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.504 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS IS A LITTLE

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:20.839 region:rollup2
OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:21.807 region:rollup2
AT A SECOND WAVE DIFFERENCES

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:22.440 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH MORE TARGETED A

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:22.974 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.544 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL FUNDING FOR A

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:26.978 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:29.548 region:rollup2
OF REASONS UNDER THE PREVIOUS.

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:31.550 region:rollup2
SCHOOL FINANCE SYSTEM BUT UNDER

00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:32.651 region:rollup2
LC FF THEY CAN ONLY RECEIVE

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.052 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:35.454 region:rollup2
GRANT FUNDING.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:37.222 region:rollup2
FOR THE SPECIFIC STERN

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:38.657 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE SO

00:32:37.222 --> 00:32:39.724 region:rollup2
ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:41.493 region:rollup2
SERVING.

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:43.428 region:rollup2
OF LOW INCOME OR ENGLISH LEARNER

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:44.763 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.598 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN ONLY AT SCHOOL

00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:47.599 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT SERVE AN AWFUL

00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:48.433 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:50.502 region:rollup2
RECEIVING CONCENTRATION GRANT

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:51.469 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:32:50.502 --> 00:32:52.471 region:rollup2
NO THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:53.538 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:55.407 region:rollup2
SERVE THOSE STUDENTS WERE

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:58.543 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY LEFT IN THE COLD

00:32:55.407 --> 00:33:00.212 region:rollup2
UNDER LC FF. AS WE DESCRIBED ON

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:02.547 region:rollup2
PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT LC FF

00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:04.316 region:rollup2
DID INCLUDE A NUMBER OF. ADD ON

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:06.184 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE DIRECT SOME

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:07.452 region:rollup2
FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:09.087 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:11.089 region:rollup2
RECEIVING MORE FUNDING UNDER THE

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:12.991 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS FINANCE SYSTEM THAN

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:15.627 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD. UNDER THE BASIC

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:17.128 region:rollup2
BASED SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION

00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:18.797 region:rollup2
FORMULA UNDER LC FF.

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:20.098 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS TO SAY THAT GENERALLY

00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:22.067 region:rollup2
SPEAKING LCF EFFORTS MUCH MORE

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
TARGETED TOWARDS DISTRICTS THAT

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:25.136 region:rollup2
SERVE LOW INCOME ENGLISH HONORS

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:26.938 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:28.340 region:rollup2
NOW CONSEQUENTLY AS WE SHOWN ON

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:29.975 region:rollup2
PAGE FOUR.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.343 region:rollup2
SPENDING DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE

00:33:29.975 --> 00:33:34.212 region:rollup2
HIGH POVERTY DIFFERENT THAT

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:35.780 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IS NOTABLY LARGER NOW

00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:38.116 region:rollup2
THAN IT WAS UNDER THE OLD

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.985 region:rollup2
FINANCE SYSTEM. NOW EVEN UNDER

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:41.253 region:rollup2
THE OLD FINANCE SYSTEM.

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:42.387 region:rollup2
HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS IN IN

00:33:41.253 --> 00:33:43.922 region:rollup2
HERE WE'RE DESCRIBING HIGH

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:46.224 region:rollup2
POVERTY DISTRICTS AS THOSE

00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:48.159 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT SERVE MORE THAN

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:50.228 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT ENGLISH SIREN LOW

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:51.997 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS. AND THEY SPEND

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:53.698 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT MORE THAN

00:33:51.997 --> 00:33:55.166 region:rollup2
NO POVERTY DISTRICTS.

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:57.135 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S GROWN UP

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:59.337 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY TO ABOVE TWENTY

00:33:57.135 --> 00:34:01.573 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT AT THAT STARTING

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:02.841 region:rollup2
PLACE REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WAS

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:05.243 region:rollup2
SOME TARGETING UNDER THE

00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:06.478 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS FINANCE SYSTEM BUT.

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:07.746 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:10.315 region:rollup2
TARGETING NOW.

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:12.050 region:rollup2
THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT. HIGH

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:13.652 region:rollup2
POVERTY DISTRICTS SPEND A LOT

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.288 region:rollup2

WE DO FIND EH AS WE.

00:34:16.288 --> 00:34:19.991 region:rollup2
POINT ON ON PAGE FIVE THAT

THEIR BASE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:23.461 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE SOMEWHAT POORER

00:34:22.127 --> 00:34:25.063 region:rollup2
THAN THOSE THAT ARE OFFERED BY

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:27.032 region:rollup2
LOW POVERTY DISTRICTS. IN

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:29.434 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IF YOU LOOK AT CLASS

00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:31.102 region:rollup2
SIZES THOSE TEND TO BE LARGER.

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.604 region:rollup2
IN YOUR HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:34.773 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT TEACHER PAY

POVERTY DISTRICTS.

00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:40.312 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:42.380 region:rollup2
COUNTERINTUITIVE MOST OF WHAT

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:44.282 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SPENDING THEIR GENERAL

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.917 region:rollup2

RECEIVING.

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:52.290 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT MORE THAN ANOTHER

HIRING FEWER TEACHERS HOW IS

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:57.996 region:rollup2
THAT POSSIBLE WHEN THE ANSWER IS

00:34:56.595 --> 00:35:00.165 region:rollup2
THAT. THESE HIGH POVERTY

00:34:57.996 --> 00:35:01.166 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING AN AWFUL

00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:02.734 region:rollup2
LOT OF THEIR BUDGETS AND

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.302 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT LOW POVERTY

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:07.238 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS EITHER DO NOT OFFER OR

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:08.440 region:rollup2

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:19.150 region:rollup2
TAKE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH CHUNK

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:20.018 region:rollup2
OUT OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.620 region:rollup2

SCHOOL PENSIONS.

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:11.062 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT.

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.897 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:16.701 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH AND THIS IN COMING

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:17.335 region:rollup2
YEARS OF BEFORE I I PASS ON I.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:20.305 region:rollup2
DO WANNA.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:20.872 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE

00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:22.107 region:rollup2

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:35.854 region:rollup2
CROSSWALK BETWEEN.

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:37.322 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THOSE

00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:38.356 region:rollup2
BUDGETS AND THE INFORMATION

00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:39.557 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE HELL CAPS WERE

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:41.426 region:rollup2
WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:44.762 region:rollup2
THAT PROPOSAL. WE UNDERSTAND

00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:46.231 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IS A CONCERN. A

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.632 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.501 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:51.069 region:rollup2

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:52.537 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS.

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:54.706 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROPOSALS WELL

00:37:52.537 --> 00:37:56.040 region:rollup2
TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE CONCERNS

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:57.742 region:rollup2

AVAILABLE ON ALL CAPS.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:03.381 region:rollup2
IT WOULD PUT IT IN A THE BUDGET

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:04.816 region:rollup2
BUT THE BUDGET IS NOT REALLY A

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:06.985 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT THAT'S DESIGNED FOR

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:08.720 region:rollup2
PUBLIC CONSUMPTION IT'S ALREADY

00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:10.155 region:rollup2
A LONG AND COMPLICATED.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.456 region:rollup2
A PROCESS WHICH WE THINK TO THE

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:12.824 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:14.325 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS WOULD WE

00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:16.060 region:rollup2
WOULD RECOMMEND.

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:19.430 region:rollup2
A FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE EL

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.365 region:rollup2

FEW ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:49.494 region:rollup2
BUILDING UPON WHAT'S ALREADY

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:51.262 region:rollup2
BEEN SAID AROUND AT THE

00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:52.630 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF LC FF AND AND

LCF OFTEN THAT WHERE AT DOING%

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:01.306 region:rollup2
THAT EARLY NAY NO WILL TALK

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:03.474 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT LATER.

00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:06.110 region:rollup2
IN THAT IN THE NEXT.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:07.212 region:rollup2
ISSUE AROUND THE NEED TO AYE

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.479 region:rollup2
BUT WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

00:39:07.212 --> 00:39:11.115 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STRONG NEED TO PUT

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:13.351 region:rollup2
MORE FUNDING TOWARDS. US SCHOOLS

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:15.620 region:rollup2
AND LCF MATHIS WE THINK ABOUT

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.487 region:rollup2
WHAT ELSE IT WHAT FULL FUNDING

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.289 region:rollup2
MEANS WHICH MEANS THAT WE'VE

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:19.891 region:rollup2
RESTORED.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:22.026 region:rollup2
ARE FUNDING LEVELS BACK TO

00:39:19.891 --> 00:39:24.462 region:rollup2
SIXTY THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:28.299 region:rollup2
FUNDING LEVELS ADJUSTED FOR COST

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:30.335 region:rollup2
OF LIVING SO SO AM AS MISTER

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:31.736 region:rollup2
ANDERSON SAID IT YOU KNOW. WHAT

00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:34.472 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:37.242 region:rollup2
HOW WE MAKE I'M MORE INVESTMENTS

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:39.410 region:rollup2
IN OUR SCHOOLS IS THAT WAS NOT?

00:39:37.242 --> 00:39:41.679 region:rollup2
SORT OF THAT THAT THE GOAL IS

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:47.285 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FUNDING

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:48.720 region:rollup2
FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND. AND AND

00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:50.488 region:rollup2
IT'S WHAT HE'S IT MISTER

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.824 region:rollup2
ANDERSON ALSO TALKED ABOUT SORT

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:54.592 region:rollup2
OF THAT WITH THAT WERE STILL

00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:58.896 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO SEE.

00:39:54.592 --> 00:40:01.132 region:rollup2
AT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND SOME

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:09.741 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE'D THERE NEEDS TO

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:11.242 region:rollup2
BE MORE ELSE IF THAT'S AND THE

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.343 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:14.445 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THE COURSE

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:15.947 region:rollup2
THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. A

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.514 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN THAT AND I THINK THE

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:18.182 region:rollup2
ONLY THING I WOULD JUST ADD

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:22.687 region:rollup2

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:33.958 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS THAT DESPITE

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.693 region:rollup2
INCREASED LCF IF FUNDING WE

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:37.461 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEED

00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:39.063 region:rollup2
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:41.032 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES.

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:43.167 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE ALLOCATED FIVE

00:46:41.032 --> 00:46:45.403 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:47.371 region:rollup2

SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS.

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:50.374 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THAT INVESTMENT IS STILL

00:46:48.873 --> 00:46:52.043 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT TWO

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:53.611 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR SHORT OF WHAT WE

00:46:52.043 --> 00:46:55.112 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO MEET THE STAFFING

00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:57.048 region:rollup2

WE ALSO HAVE ABOUT FIVE POINT

FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.956 region:rollup2

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:14.198 region:rollup2
DOLLAR SHORTFALL TO MEET THE

00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:31.916 region:rollup2

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:37.621 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ESSENTIAL IN HELPING

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:41.959 region:rollup2
OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:45.262 region:rollup2

SPEAK ON BEHALF OF TOWARDS

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:47:56.707 --> 00:48:00.177 region:rollup2
NOT JUST AS A.

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:01.579 region:rollup2
AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:02.179 region:rollup2

00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.918 region:rollup2
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:09.720 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR FOR FULLY FUNDING OF

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:11.489 region:rollup2
THE LC FF IN THE PROPOSED

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.456 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. I

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:13.157 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:15.760 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:48:13.157 --> 00:48:17.361 region:rollup2
.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.563 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THE FORMULA.

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:21.132 region:rollup2
BUT THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:23.300 region:rollup2
FORMULA ARE BASED ARE SOLID. ARE

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:25.202 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.004 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FLAW THAT DOESN'T.

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:28.105 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ENOUGH SPACE FUNDING TO

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:29.840 region:rollup2
ADDRESS BASIC NEEDS

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.908 region:rollup2
OF OUR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.977 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE RETIREMENT

00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:34.912 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE INCREASE

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:37.314 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY JUST ONE YEAR

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:38.849 region:rollup2
AFTER THE L. CFF WAS ADOPTED.

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:40.184 region:rollup2
I AM GLAD TO SEE THE COMMITTEE

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.719 region:rollup2
DOES GOING TO DISCUSS THAT HERE

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:43.120 region:rollup2
OUT TODAY IN THE FOLLOWING

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.055 region:rollup2
THE TORCH UNIFIED SCHOOL

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:46.757 region:rollup2

00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:51.028 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY.

EDUCATION CAMPUSES THAT ARE SELF

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:58.402 region:rollup2
SUSTAINING.

00:48:57.201 --> 00:48:59.637 region:rollup2
WE ARE DIVERSE COMMUNITY IN MANY

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.805 region:rollup2
WAYS

00:48:59.637 --> 00:49:02.807 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS SPEAK SEVENTY SIX

00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:04.275 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:05.509 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE AN UNDUE PICKET A

00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:07.378 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF A THIRTY SIX

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:09.447 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:49:07.378 --> 00:49:10.714 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE THE

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:12.316 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LCF OFF.

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:14.151 region:rollup2
OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM HAS GONE

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:15.986 region:rollup2
THROUGH A TRANSPARENT PROCESS

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:17.688 region:rollup2
INVOLVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:19.657 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.090 region:rollup2
CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN.

00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.425 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS HAS BEEN

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.160 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:24.829 region:rollup2
AND IS MAXIMIZING THE USE OF THE

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.797 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FUNDING THAT

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.631 region:rollup2
WE RECEIVE TO IMPROVE AND

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:30.100 region:rollup2
INCREASE SERVICES FOR THESE

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.868 region:rollup2
TARGETED STUDENTS.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.070 region:rollup2
WE'RE FOLLOWING THE INTENT OF

00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:34.438 region:rollup2
THE LAW AND RESISTING PRESSURES

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:37.341 region:rollup2
FROM SOME GROUPS IN OUR

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:39.376 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT ARE REQUESTING TO

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:40.878 region:rollup2
USE A SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:42.379 region:rollup2
BASS GRANT EXPENDITURES.

00:49:40.878 --> 00:49:44.348 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS THE BOARD

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:46.250 region:rollup2
SALARY ENHANCEMENTS.

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:47.885 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.153 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE LCF OFF

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:50.521 region:rollup2
NOR DO WE BELIEVE THAT IT

00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.722 region:rollup2
DIRECTS THE RESOURCES TO THE

00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:53.757 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT GENERATE THOSE

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:55.526 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS.

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:56.961 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO OUR USE.

00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:58.629 region:rollup2
OUR BELIEF ON THE USE OF THE

00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:00.097 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FUNDS.

00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:01.532 region:rollup2
WE ARE PROUD OF THE WAY IN WHICH

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:03.434 region:rollup2
WE'VE UTILIZED THE ONE TIME

00:50:01.532 --> 00:50:05.002 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO US

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:06.704 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.572 region:rollup2
ONE SUCH HIGHLIGHT OCCURRED THIS

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:10.040 region:rollup2
PAST DECEMBER. WHEN ED SOURCE

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:11.642 region:rollup2
FEATURED TORRENT UNIFIED'S

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.577 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEXT

00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:14.678 region:rollup2
GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS.

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:16.580 region:rollup2
THIS COMPREHENSIVE TEACHER

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.816 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAM WAS PRIMARILY

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.384 region:rollup2
FUNDED FROM ONE TIME DOLLARS AND

00:50:18.816 --> 00:50:21.685 region:rollup2
ASSISTED OVER FIVE HUNDRED

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:23.687 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND THOUSANDS OF

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:25.289 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN LEARNING AND WORKING

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:27.658 region:rollup2
WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS.

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:29.226 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER. WE WE

00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:31.829 region:rollup2
HAVE RECENTLY HAD TO USE ONE

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:33.197 region:rollup2
TIME FUNDS FOR ONGOING EXPENSES

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:35.199 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:35.1000 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN THE BASE GRANT.

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:38.369 region:rollup2
STEPPED SUPPORT AND STUFF

00:50:35.1000 --> 00:50:40.004 region:rollup2
STAN.

00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:40.604 region:rollup2
BOB PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BUILT

00:50:40.004 --> 00:50:43.107 region:rollup2
AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:44.275 region:rollup2
PUT UPON US.

00:50:43.107 --> 00:50:46.277 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A

00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:47.311 region:rollup2
BUDGETING BEST PRACTICE.

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:48.512 region:rollup2
TO USE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ON

00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:50.981 region:rollup2
GOING NEEDS BUT WE HAVE LITTLE

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:52.650 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:54.518 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:56.353 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET.

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:58.055 region:rollup2
FULL FUNDING OF THE LC FF

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:59.523 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE VERY FEW IF ANY NEW

00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:01.258 region:rollup2
DOLLARS LEFT AFTER ADDRESSING

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:03.060 region:rollup2
STIRS AND PURRS.

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:04.795 region:rollup2
STEPPING COLUMN INCREASES

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.629 region:rollup2
AND INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:07.932 region:rollup2
WITH EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:09.433 region:rollup2
SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:10.701 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:12.169 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH SIX POINT SIX

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.871 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:14.905 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WILL ACHED AT SEA AND

00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:16.307 region:rollup2
INCREASE UNDER THE.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:18.042 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:51:16.307 --> 00:51:20.110 region:rollup2
FIVE POINT SIX MILLION WILL BE

00:51:18.042 --> 00:51:21.779 region:rollup2
USED TO COVER STIRRED SPURS.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.680 region:rollup2
AND STEPPING CALL.

00:51:21.779 --> 00:51:23.948 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES ONLY ONE MILLION

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.849 region:rollup2
DOLLARS

00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:27.518 region:rollup2
LESS THAN ONE PER ONE HALF OF

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:29.920 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET. TO

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:32.957 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:35.259 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION UTILITIES AND

00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:36.527 region:rollup2
UPGRADING TECHNOLOGY.

00:51:35.259 --> 00:51:38.362 region:rollup2
THE PICTURE FOR NINETEEN TWENTY

00:51:36.527 --> 00:51:40.030 region:rollup2
IS MORE BLEAK.

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:41.632 region:rollup2
UNDER THE ALL CFF WE ARE ONLY

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.967 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO RECEIVE A COST OF

00:51:41.632 --> 00:51:44.635 region:rollup2
LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF TWO POINT

00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:45.202 region:rollup2
FOUR ONE PERCENT.

00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:46.770 region:rollup2
OR THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:48.305 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.474 region:rollup2
IF THAT IS THE CASE WE WILL NEED

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:52.209 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:53.944 region:rollup2
DOLLARS JUST TO TREAD WATER.

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:56.113 region:rollup2
AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR ONLY STIRS

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:57.615 region:rollup2
AND PURRS AND STEPPING CALL.

00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:59.016 region:rollup2
IN A DISTRICT WHERE ALMOST

00:51:57.615 --> 00:52:01.051 region:rollup2
NINETY ONE PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:02.620 region:rollup2
GOES TO PERSONNEL. THE ONLY WAY

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:04.989 region:rollup2
TO MAKE UP FOR THESE KINDS OF

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.266 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WOULD SEVENTY FIVE

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:49.966 region:rollup2
PERCENT KIND DUPLICATING COUNTER

00:57:49.266 --> 00:57:51.068 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN.

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
THIRTY THIRTY THREE PERCENT THAT

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:53.937 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEEDS TO BRING THAT

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.572 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS ARE DIFFERENT

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:57.274 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:59.109 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS COMMONSENSE KIND

00:57:57.274 --> 00:58:00.777 region:rollup2
OF SHOWS THAT BUT THAT STIRS

00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:02.913 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE THE SAME FOR YOU FOR

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:04.448 region:rollup2
YOUR DISTRICT SO HOW HOW DO WE

00:58:02.913 --> 00:58:05.983 region:rollup2
RECONCILE THE FACT THAT.

00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:06.783 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDING STRUCTURE

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:10.520 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS.

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.558 region:rollup2
SO.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.393 region:rollup2
I'M I'M NOT QUITE SURE I'M I'M

00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:17.027 region:rollup2
I'M NOT THE THIS STATE FINANCE

00:58:16.393 --> 00:58:19.696 region:rollup2
EXPERTS.

00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:20.564 region:rollup2
AND BUT YOU KNOW FROM FROM THE

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:22.532 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL.

00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:24.267 region:rollup2
IF IF THAT OBLIGATION WAS TAKEN

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:25.869 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM US.

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:27.871 region:rollup2
THEN THEN AND AND WE COULD PLAN

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:30.207 region:rollup2
FOR THAT. OF THAT WOULD BE GREAT

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:32.175 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS A ONE TIME PAYMENT TO

00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:33.777 region:rollup2
STARS RIPPERS TOOK TO ALLEVIATE

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:36.680 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN FOR THE SHORT TIME.

00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:37.581 region:rollup2
IS IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.548 region:rollup2
THE BRITISH A ONE TIME FUNDS.

00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:40.217 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.518 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE'S

00:58:40.217 --> 00:58:43.954 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S AN ONGOING PLAN TO

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:45.622 region:rollup2
HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

00:58:43.954 --> 00:58:47.657 region:rollup2
THOSE NEEDS.

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:49.760 region:rollup2
IN THE LONG TERM THEN THEN WE

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:49.993 region:rollup2
CAN ADEQUATELY ADEQUATELY PLAN

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.228 region:rollup2
AT AND.

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:53.030 region:rollup2
.

00:58:51.228 --> 00:58:55.232 region:rollup2
AND AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:55.532 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE ARE SOLID AND

00:58:55.232 --> 00:58:57.401 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE.

00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.902 region:rollup2
.

00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:00.570 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WERE NOT.

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:02.272 region:rollup2
YEAR TO YEAR.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.707 region:rollup2
ASK YOU KNOW.

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:05.308 region:rollup2
TRYING TO TRYING TO SEND A

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:06.943 region:rollup2
MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT.

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:09.646 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDS THAT THAT WE

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:11.715 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A IT IT'S BEEN IT'S

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:14.317 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. WHEN THE

00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:16.820 region:rollup2
STATE ECONOMY IS.

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:18.555 region:rollup2
GOING CRAZY AND THE STOCK

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:20.390 region:rollup2
MARKET'S UP AND YET WE'RE

00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:21.625 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL CUTS AND

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.726 region:rollup2
I KNOW PEOPLE IN DISTRICTS THAT

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:24.061 region:rollup2
BUT THERE DID DID LAYOFFS THIS

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:25.262 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR.

00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:27.464 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:29.199 region:rollup2
YOU OF THAT IT AND IT'S BECAUSE

00:59:27.464 --> 00:59:30.834 region:rollup2
OF OF THE LACK OF ABILITY TO

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:32.602 region:rollup2
PLAN AND THAT.

00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:33.904 region:rollup2
IT'S CONFUSING THAT THE.

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:35.405 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY AND AND TORRANCE

00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:37.874 region:rollup2
FOR SURE.

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:39.876 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:47.417 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FOR THIS

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:48.819 region:rollup2
PANEL ISSUE ONE MISTER JARVIS.

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:50.620 region:rollup2
OR TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:53.290 region:rollup2
TOUGH FOR THE. THIS DISCUSSION

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.890 region:rollup2
THEY'LL CFM HAVING BETTER.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:58.695 region:rollup2
FOR SIX YEARS NOW WATCHING IT

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:59.830 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH.

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:01.331 region:rollup2
I THINK WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WE

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:04.067 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH WAS THAT.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:06.069 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO ADD SOME STABILITY

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:07.304 region:rollup2
TO THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THAT'S WHY

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:09.940 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THOSE YOU HAVE FOR THAT.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:11.475 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD PLAN WHEN

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.109 region:rollup2
I KNOW ON HOUSING ISSUES ACT OUT

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.677 region:rollup2
IT WAS ODD THAT.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.946 region:rollup2
START SPENDING MONEY BEFORE WE

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:17.514 region:rollup2
EVEN GOT OUR BUDGETS WE HAD THE.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.849 region:rollup2
MAKE GUESSES DEFERRED ROBERT

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.050 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO GO.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT THIS AN ATTEMPT TO

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:24.654 region:rollup2
DO THIS.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:25.989 region:rollup2
I'D DO QUESTION TO A DOCTOR

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.756 region:rollup2
STOKES JUDGING YOUR FUTURE FEW

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:30.260 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:33.263 region:rollup2
THE.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.531 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDED THE LC FF.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.699 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP FROM YOUR

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:37.367 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON THE GROUND WHERE

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:39.002 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE GO NEXT.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:41.505 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE JUST SAY.

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.873 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDED NEXT YEAR SO WE SAY

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:44.941 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A GOOD BENCHMARK BUT WE

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:46.843 region:rollup2
SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER MEASUREMENT IN SOME

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:50.780 region:rollup2
OTHER RESULTS FROM THAT.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.815 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU THINK.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.550 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK AN ASPIRATIONAL

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.485 region:rollup2
TARGET IS IMPORTANT.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:57.087 region:rollup2
A YOU KNOW AS AS CITIZENS OF

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.587 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHERE DO WE WANT OUR

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:59.289 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BE.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:01.625 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW IT.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:17.007 region:rollup2

I'M DOING THIS.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:30.747 region:rollup2
THE JOB WHICH GOES TO MY NEXT

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:32.649 region:rollup2
THING ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
WHEN WE STARTED LC FF FIVE YEARS

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:34.751 region:rollup2
AGO.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.620 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.120 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP NOW WE'VE BEEN

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.688 region:rollup2
GOING IN THE PROGRAM I'M

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.723 region:rollup2
WONDERING.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.191 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU START FUELING THE

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:42.792 region:rollup2
ENGINE.

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:43.727 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO START

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:45.996 region:rollup2
SOON?

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:47.030 region:rollup2
THE RESULTS.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.598 region:rollup2
IN THE CHURCH AND THE

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.834 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR THE KIDS.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.868 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IF A CHILD

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:53.837 region:rollup2
COMES IN IN A SAFE.

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.971 region:rollup2
.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:56.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DEEP WE GET FUNDED

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:58.274 region:rollup2
FULLY.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:01.177 region:rollup2
AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:03.246 region:rollup2
NOW THEY'RE. AND HIGH SCHOOL.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.814 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY AN IMPACT UPON THEIR

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:06.483 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC SKILLS A MINUTE DATA

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:08.551 region:rollup2
PROBLEM MATH READING BECAUSE WE

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:10.020 region:rollup2
START WE WANT FUNDING EVERYTHING

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.553 region:rollup2
WE CAN AND WE HAD A PROBLEM.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.921 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN OF

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:13.423 region:rollup2
COLOR.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:14.691 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE FULLY FUNDING IT WHEN

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
DO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO START

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:17.927 region:rollup2
SEEING THE RESULTS FROM THAT IS

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:19.362 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT STARTS THE NEXT

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:21.231 region:rollup2
YEAR OR THAT WEEK I MEAN. I

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:22.932 region:rollup2
THINK IT STARTS.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:24.668 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE SOMETIME BUT I'M

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:26.503 region:rollup2
NOT A PROFESSIONAL LIKE YOU ARE.

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:27.771 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU THINK THE CHEAP WHEN WE

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.339 region:rollup2
GIVE MONEY WHEN WE SEE THE

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:31.041 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM OUR MONEY.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:32.809 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:34.077 region:rollup2
HOW FAR DOWN THE LINE.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.946 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA VERY.

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:38.548 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:40.050 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE USE OF

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:41.651 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WE'VE SEEN

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:44.554 region:rollup2
SOME VERY TARGETED.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:46.523 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND AND AND ACTIONS.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:48.191 region:rollup2
BE PUT INTO PLACE I THINK THE

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:51.027 region:rollup2
ALL CAP IS A GOOD DOCUMENT.

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:52.262 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT PROCESS IS IS

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.096 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO INVOLVE

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:56.232 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:58.802 region:rollup2
ALL ALONG THE WAY. AND THEN I

01:03:56.232 --> 01:04:00.503 region:rollup2
WOULD CONTINUE THAT THE THE.

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:04.207 region:rollup2
NEW ACCOUNTABILITY MODEL TO TRY

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:07.177 region:rollup2
TO NOT GET SCHOOLS TO TO REALLY.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:10.413 region:rollup2
HONE IN ON ON CERTAIN SUBGROUPS

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:11.648 region:rollup2
AND AND SCHOOLS AND EH YOU KNOW

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:13.416 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE EIGHT STATE

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:16.186 region:rollup2
CONTENT ARE EIGHT SIT PRIORITY

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:17.620 region:rollup2
AREAS. AND THAT'S THAT'S A A

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.555 region:rollup2
GREAT MODEL THAT.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.124 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:22.425 region:rollup2
THROUGH IN SOME WAYS BUT. IN

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:24.327 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND DATA FIRST FOR

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:26.496 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THE MEASURE

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.963 region:rollup2
IS DIFFICULT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:30.667 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:32.001 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THOSE IF IF SCHOOLS CAN

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:34.871 region:rollup2
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:38.141 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND AND IDENTIFY

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:39.142 region:rollup2
USING DATA. HOW STUDENTS ARE

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:40.376 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING?

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:42.979 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I HEARD.

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:45.081 region:rollup2
OF SUPERDELEGATE BOUT

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:46.649 region:rollup2
COUNSELING AND NURSES AND AND

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.850 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS AS

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.685 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:51.287 region:rollup2
DEBTS THAT ARE HARDER TO

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:53.256 region:rollup2
MEASURE WHEN WHEN STUDENTS ARE

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
MORE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ANYA

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.659 region:rollup2
ATTENDS ART I UNDERSTAND THE

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:57.193 region:rollup2
HARDER TO MEASURE IT VARIES

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.827 region:rollup2
BETWEEN EVERYBODY

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:57.994 region:rollup2
I'M TRACK WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.562 region:rollup2
YOU

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:00.196 region:rollup2
THE FIRST QUESTION I WAS.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.798 region:rollup2
WHY I WANTED TO CONTINUE THIS

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:03.900 region:rollup2
LINE OF THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:05.068 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDING THE LC FF?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.503 region:rollup2
AND IF IMPACT A FULL OF FUN AND

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.171 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE IF F. IS GOING TO BE

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:09.973 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR GOING TO BE. DOWN

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:11.975 region:rollup2
YEARS AND THE WHOLE REASON WE'RE

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:13.676 region:rollup2
JOINED IS DRILL IS TO BRING OUR

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:14.811 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC STANDARD HIGHER FOR OUR

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.479 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SO THAT THEY ARE.

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:18.047 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO GO OFF IN COLLEGE

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:19.949 region:rollup2
INTO ONE OF THE THINGS.

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:22.786 region:rollup2
AND THEIR LIVES SO IF WE'RE

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:24.821 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDING THE LC FF NOW.

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:26.222 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF THAT WILL BE.

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.823 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS FROM NOW TWO YEARS

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.925 region:rollup2
FROM NOW WHEN WILL THIS THING

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.160 region:rollup2
BE.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.328 region:rollup2
IN WHICH TIED TO MY EARLIER

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.863 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT IS THE

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:35.532 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE OF THE LC FF'S IS

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:36.633 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HIGHER BECAUSE?

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.501 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND I

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:40.870 region:rollup2
FIRST GOT ELECTED YEAR WAS?

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:42.705 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THE ACADEMICS IN

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:45.041 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FROM BE IN. FORTY

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:46.443 region:rollup2
EIGHTH IN THE NATION TO ISIDRO

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.877 region:rollup2
CROWD KARADZIC CAN WE GET TO

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.045 region:rollup2

DON'T KNOW GIVE ME A NUMBER AND

01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:53.950 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS WE

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:55.819 region:rollup2
WOULD GET THERE AND I THINK.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.986 region:rollup2
RESOURCES MATTER LIKE VLC AFFAIR

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:59.155 region:rollup2
FOR THE RESULTS THAT WOULD COME

01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:00.990 region:rollup2
FOR THAT SHOULD BE. DOWNLINE AND

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.358 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE LIKE

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.094 region:rollup2
ELEVATE THE DISCUSSION.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:06.162 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS.

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:08.164 region:rollup2

WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:47.396 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO. MINIMIZE THAT BUT

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.698 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:49.966 region:rollup2
THEIR CHALLENGES A BUDGETING

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:51.767 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DECISIONS.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:53.636 region:rollup2
INFINITE NEEDYOU COULD ARGUE

WITH FINITE RESOURCES WE ARE

IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACH

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:11.120 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT AND I THINK I

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:11.654 region:rollup2
WOULD KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.056 region:rollup2

FUTURE YEARS WHILE CERTAINLY A

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:27.036 region:rollup2
NOBLE GOAL TO DO THAT ON ITS

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.537 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AN

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:30.072 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN A LARGELY COMMITTED

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:31.707 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED. AND EIGHTEEN

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.875 region:rollup2

EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION GOES TO

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:42.785 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THEN

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:43.853 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT IT'S THE OTHER SIDE

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:45.121 region:rollup2
OF THE BUDGET SO TO THE EXTENT

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.689 region:rollup2
THAT WE BEGIN TO START

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.890 region:rollup2
COMMITTING OURSELVES TO THESE.

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:48.891 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.393 region:rollup2
INCREASES THE CIVIC EVEN I'LL

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:52.395 region:rollup2
SEE IF IT STARTS BUT PRESSURE

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:53.896 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE OF THE STATE RIGHT

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:56.032 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION. OKAY

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:57.133 region:rollup2

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:58.334 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WITHIN NINETY EIGHT EVER

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.735 region:rollup2
GONNA ELIMINATE THEM SO WE'RE

KINDS OF DECISIONS AND AT THIS

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:05.007 region:rollup2
POINT WE CONTINUE TO FEEL THAT.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.608 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT NEW WANTS ITS

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:08.311 region:rollup2

IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:46.615 region:rollup2

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:22.077 region:rollup2
THE.

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:26.081 region:rollup2
THE PENSION COSTS.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:27.015 region:rollup2
ARE THE BIGGEST DRIVERS.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:28.717 region:rollup2
YES YES SO.

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:30.752 region:rollup2

WE HAVE A CHAPTER SPECIFICALLY

01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:39.527 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE. A IT IS

01:31:38.393 --> 01:31:41.029 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT WE

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:43.298 region:rollup2
HEAR ABOUT FROM THE FIELD.

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.799 region:rollup2
THESE INCREASING PENSION

01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:47.135 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THAT

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:47.402 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WE WE OFFER THREE

01:31:47.135 --> 01:31:49.471 region:rollup2
GENERAL.

01:31:47.402 --> 01:31:50.939 region:rollup2
.

01:31:49.471 --> 01:31:53.441 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:56.244 region:rollup2
CONSIDER A OF WHICH THE FIRST

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:58.146 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON

01:31:56.244 --> 01:32:00.015 region:rollup2
PROVIDING GENERAL PURPOSE

01:31:58.146 --> 01:32:02.083 region:rollup2
FUNDING. A AND THAT WOULD

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.618 region:rollup2
INCLUDE CONTINUING TO DEDICATE

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.986 region:rollup2
MOST NEW PROPOSITION NINETY

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:07.322 region:rollup2
EIGHT FUNDING TO SOURCES LIKE

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:09.157 region:rollup2
THE LC FF. ó OR TO THESE ONE

01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:11.059 region:rollup2
TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS OF

01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:13.495 region:rollup2
FURTHER SUGGESTION WE WE MADE

01:32:11.059 --> 01:32:15.230 region:rollup2
WAS THAT. IN THE DIRECTION THAT

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:16.698 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE GIVES ALONG WITH

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:17.365 region:rollup2
THE ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.967 region:rollup2
GRANTS.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.635 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OFFERED AND IN THE

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:21.803 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THERE IS ONE

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:24.706 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT BILLION.

01:32:21.803 --> 01:32:26.641 region:rollup2
DEDICATED FOR THAT PURPOSE SO

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.308 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:30.044 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY SICK.

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:31.946 region:rollup2
SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR US

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:33.615 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATING FUTURE PENSION COST

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:35.917 region:rollup2
PRESSURES WE DO THINK THAT THAT

01:32:33.615 --> 01:32:37.318 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IS MEANINGFUL AND HOW

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:38.653 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:41.589 region:rollup2
THOSE DOLLARS. AND THE LAST

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:43.158 region:rollup2
OPTION THAT WE WE PRESENT.

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:46.227 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:48.897 region:rollup2
A PAYMENT ON BEHALF OF

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:50.965 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS OUT OF STATE FUNDS

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:52.400 region:rollup2
THIS COULD BE EITHER PROPOSITION

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:53.234 region:rollup2
OR NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.703 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.571 region:rollup2
WE THINK IF THE STATE WERE TO

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:58.306 region:rollup2
DEDICATE.

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:58.706 region:rollup2
AT LEAST SEVERAL HUNDRED

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.675 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:03.645 region:rollup2
.

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:05.780 region:rollup2
AND TO PREPAYING SOME DISTRICT

01:33:03.645 --> 01:33:07.382 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS FOR DISTRICTS AND

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
AND THEN CRAFTING SOME LANGUAGE

01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:11.386 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:13.154 region:rollup2
WOULD ASSOCIATE THE GAINS WITH

01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:16.191 region:rollup2
THOSE PREPAYMENTS WITH SOME

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:18.059 region:rollup2
REDUCTION AND THE INCREASED

01:33:16.191 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:20.962 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT WOULD KICK CAN.

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:23.598 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE AT THE NEXT

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:24.966 region:rollup2
RECESSION OR AT ANY DIFFICULT

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:26.534 region:rollup2
FISCAL TIMES IN THE FUTURE THAT

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:29.037 region:rollup2
THAT COULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT

01:33:26.534 --> 01:33:31.072 region:rollup2

HAS BEEN DELIVERING.

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.851 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:52.253 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE TOM

01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:53.688 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:55.023 region:rollup2

IT.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:59.527 region:rollup2
COUPLED WITH INCREASING COSTS

01:34:58.493 --> 01:35:01.296 region:rollup2
LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:02.764 region:rollup2
I'M WE DID PUT IN AS AS THE.

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:03.698 region:rollup2
.

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:05.466 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OUT

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.601 region:rollup2
MENTIONED SUGGESTING LANGUAGE IN

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.402 region:rollup2
OUR TRAILER BILL IT WOULDN'T

01:35:06.601 --> 01:35:09.103 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THERE.

01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:09.771 region:rollup2
SPECIFYING THAT OF THAT ONE

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:11.072 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IT'S

01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:13.174 region:rollup2
GONNA GO OUT FOR DISCRETIONARY

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:15.043 region:rollup2
ONETIME PURPOSES. OF SUGGESTING

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:16.444 region:rollup2
IN AND PUTTING IT IN THEIR IN

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:18.479 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ACTUALLY TO SAY. THESE

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:19.013 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CAN BE USED FOR.

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.348 region:rollup2
.

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:23.017 region:rollup2
STEPPED BENEFIT COSTS.

01:35:20.348 --> 01:35:23.818 region:rollup2
AND PENSION COSTS THAT THAT'S

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.253 region:rollup2
THAT'S AND ALLOW THE USE THAT AT

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.920 region:rollup2
THE DISCRETION AGAIN IT'S ONE OF

01:35:25.253 --> 01:35:27.088 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS WHERE THEY'RE GONNA

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.523 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT OF

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:30.158 region:rollup2
OKAY HOW MUCH OF A ONE TIME

01:35:28.523 --> 01:35:31.259 region:rollup2
RESOURCE WE WANT TO COMMIT MAYBE

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:31.826 region:rollup2
THAT ONGOING THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

01:35:31.259 --> 01:35:34.262 region:rollup2
TO.

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:35.496 region:rollup2
PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

01:35:34.262 --> 01:35:36.331 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:37.799 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:39.033 region:rollup2
I WOULD REITERATE WHAT I SAID

01:35:37.799 --> 01:35:41.102 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:42.103 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE LC FF AS IT WAS

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:43.137 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY ENACTED IN ENVISIONED

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.105 region:rollup2
THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK BETWEEN

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:46.007 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:46.841 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:50.044 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT.

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:51.179 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A FISCAL

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.748 region:rollup2
PICTURE.

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:55.116 region:rollup2
BUT IT SAY ALSO BUT THE

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.751 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE AND AND

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:57.719 region:rollup2
IT'S AN OUTCOME

01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:59.854 region:rollup2
SURE LIKE NOT SOME MEMBER CHAVEZ

01:35:57.719 --> 01:36:01.356 region:rollup2
SPOKE TO EARLIER WHEN WE'RE

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:02.657 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:03.925 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES NOT JUST MAKE SURE

01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:06.527 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GET. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:07.929 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE OTHER CASE MAY BE

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:09.831 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IN LINE WITH THAT

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:10.832 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE STRIDES

01:36:09.831 --> 01:36:13.534 region:rollup2
HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE.

01:36:10.832 --> 01:36:14.902 region:rollup2
THE DASHBOARD WE'RE TRYING TO.

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:16.938 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:18.740 region:rollup2
MONITORING PROGRESS ON THAT

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.641 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WE CAN.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.175 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WITH THE BUDGET

01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:21.776 region:rollup2
CROSSWALK DOCUMENT CONTINUE TO

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:24.812 region:rollup2
GIVE.

01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:27.282 region:rollup2
LOCALS MORE.

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:29.250 region:rollup2
POWER I GUESS YOU COULD SAY OR

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:31.319 region:rollup2
MORE OF THE OF IT INSIGHT.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:32.420 region:rollup2
INTO THAT AND UNDERSTANDING

01:36:31.319 --> 01:36:33.588 region:rollup2
INTO WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.757 region:rollup2
I'LL SEE IF IF IT WENT A LONG

01:36:33.588 --> 01:36:36.557 region:rollup2
WAY IN ENABLING THEM TO BE ABLE

01:36:35.757 --> 01:36:37.992 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT BUT WE'VE HAD THE

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:38.926 region:rollup2
LAST TWO YEARS THAT YOU KNOW

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:40.128 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK OUT THE THE.

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:41.896 region:rollup2
.

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:43.231 region:rollup2
THE KINKS IF YOU WILL.

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:45.933 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IN LINE WITH THAT

01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:46.668 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE I THINK LOCALS

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:48.202 region:rollup2
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALLY

01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:49.937 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE BEST POSITION MORE SO

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:51.072 region:rollup2

A FINITE POT. CERTAINLY AGAIN

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:08.423 region:rollup2

LEGISLATURE TO ON ALLOCATE

01:37:08.423 --> 01:37:10.625 region:rollup2

HAVE TO BE A PART OF.

01:37:16.264 --> 01:37:19.200 region:rollup2

WE CAN.

01:37:22.704 --> 01:37:25.740 region:rollup2
GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW THAT IS

01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:27.008 region:rollup2
LIKELY GOING TO BE THE FISCAL

01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:28.042 region:rollup2

01:37:33.648 --> 01:37:36.718 region:rollup2
PIVOTAL IN THAT SADDAM.

01:37:35.116 --> 01:37:39.320 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:48.363 region:rollup2
FINDING TARGETS GOING FORWARD.

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:49.630 region:rollup2
AND YET.

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:51.232 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:52.900 region:rollup2
FORMULA WHEN IT WAS PASSED IN

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:54.202 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN THE A

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.037 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE LOCAL

01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:56.537 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS IN

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:58.840 region:rollup2
FACT THE TOP THE FINDING

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:59.407 region:rollup2
TARGETS.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.775 region:rollup2
THAT WE ESTABLISHED IS THAT

01:37:59.407 --> 01:38:03.077 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:38:00.775 --> 01:38:04.345 region:rollup2

SEVEN OH EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:13.154 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:13.554 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE ORIGINALLY YES THAT

01:38:13.154 --> 01:38:14.989 region:rollup2

YEAH.

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:17.992 region:rollup2
SO THERE THERE'S CONCEPTUALLY

01:38:16.791 --> 01:38:19.660 region:rollup2

MARTZ RICHIE IT IS A TARGET AND

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.644 region:rollup2
IT'S A MARKER FOR CALIFORNIA AS

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:10.445 region:rollup2
FAR AS WHERE WE WANT TO GOT I

01:39:09.644 --> 01:39:11.979 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE.

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:13.448 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS EARLIER TALKED ABOUT

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:15.316 region:rollup2

SCHOOL FUNDING IS EQUITABLE AND

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:23.724 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:26.294 region:rollup2
CONCEPT BUT IT DIDN'T ALWAYS

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.928 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THE ADEQUACY OF FUNDING

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:28.229 region:rollup2
AS WE HEARD AT OUR FIRST HEARING

01:39:26.928 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:31.332 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT TOILETS AND THEY

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:33.167 region:rollup2
WERE INCREASED SCHOOL FUNDING.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:34.735 region:rollup2
.

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:35.837 region:rollup2
BY RECORD AMOUNTS TO LAST FIVE

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:38.172 region:rollup2
YEARS AND WE'RE STILL FORTY

01:39:35.837 --> 01:39:39.874 region:rollup2
SECONDS OR FORTY FIRST IN THE

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:41.676 region:rollup2
NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING.

01:39:39.874 --> 01:39:44.178 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO.

01:39:41.676 --> 01:39:45.112 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MONEY ISN'T THE

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:46.781 region:rollup2

01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:41.088 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE

01:42:39.854 --> 01:42:42.490 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:44.091 region:rollup2
SINCE IT WAS INSTITUTED IN

01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:46.293 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND EFFORT TO

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:47.862 region:rollup2
TARGET RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:49.497 region:rollup2
NEED STUDENTS IN STATE. I THINK

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:51.132 region:rollup2
THE THREE OF US WHO WERE HERE

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:53.134 region:rollup2
WHEN WE AND FOUGHT FOR LC FF IN

01:42:51.132 --> 01:42:54.168 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN.

01:42:53.134 --> 01:42:56.537 region:rollup2
AND MISTER MURATSUCHI AND

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:57.838 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAVEZ AND I BOTH KNOW

01:42:56.537 --> 01:43:00.241 region:rollup2
THAT UP IT WAS A VALIANT EFFORT

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:01.075 region:rollup2
TO START TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:43:00.241 --> 01:43:01.676 region:rollup2
CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:03.044 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE

01:43:01.676 --> 01:43:04.545 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE

01:43:03.044 --> 01:43:05.813 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES THAT WOULD INCLUDE

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:07.481 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THAT.

01:43:05.813 --> 01:43:09.016 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:09.517 region:rollup2
THE L. CFF IS ALWAYS SEEN AS A

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:11.285 region:rollup2
LIVING DOCUMENT A LIVING

01:43:09.517 --> 01:43:12.219 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:14.422 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE.

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:15.856 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT SET IN STONE BUT

01:43:14.422 --> 01:43:17.258 region:rollup2
IT IS A BILL AND HAS THE ABILITY

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.526 region:rollup2
TO BE FLEXIBLE TO HELP US TO

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:19.493 region:rollup2
MEET THE GOALS WE SET FOR

01:43:18.526 --> 01:43:20.995 region:rollup2
OURSELVES.

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:22.163 region:rollup2
AS WE DESCRIBED EARLIER THE

01:43:20.995 --> 01:43:23.330 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR MY

01:43:22.163 --> 01:43:24.198 region:rollup2
CONSIST OF A BASE GRANT

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.866 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND

01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:27.234 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS.

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:28.536 region:rollup2
A MY PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE A

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:29.737 region:rollup2
NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT GOING

01:43:28.536 --> 01:43:31.005 region:rollup2
FORWARD FOR THE LOWEST

01:43:29.737 --> 01:43:33.274 region:rollup2
PERFORMING GROUP.

01:43:31.005 --> 01:43:34.675 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE STUDENTS

01:43:33.274 --> 01:43:35.943 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES AND AND AND AT

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:37.578 region:rollup2
THIS POINT THAT GROUP IS A

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:39.413 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT WOULD

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:39.980 region:rollup2
APPLY TO ANYONE ANY GROUP THAT'S

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:40.881 region:rollup2
THE IF WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.916 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE HAVE TO

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.884 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE GROUP.

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:46.053 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EXPECTED

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:47.321 region:rollup2
SCORES CONFIRM A DISTURBING FACT

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.190 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED FOR

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:50.791 region:rollup2
YEARS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS

01:43:49.190 --> 01:43:52.026 region:rollup2
IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME ARE

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:53.627 region:rollup2
PERFORMING BELOW THE STATEWIDE

01:43:52.026 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
AVERAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE

01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:57.064 region:rollup2
ARTS AND MATH. ONLY THIRTY ONE

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:58.966 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:59.567 region:rollup2
ARTS THEY ADMIT STANDARDS AND

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:00.701 region:rollup2
ONLY NINETEEN PERCENT MET THE

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:02.403 region:rollup2
MAMAK.

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:03.604 region:rollup2
OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:05.606 region:rollup2
THAT THE MOST OF YOU PROBABLY

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:07.141 region:rollup2
SAME DONE DONE BY UC BERKELEY ON

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:08.676 region:rollup2
ON HOW THE CENTRALIZING SCHOOL

01:44:07.141 --> 01:44:10.411 region:rollup2
FINANCE MAY NARROW ACHIEVEMENT

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:12.213 region:rollup2
GAPS. UNEVEN PROGRESS IN

01:44:10.411 --> 01:44:13.781 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AFTER FORTY ONE

01:44:12.213 --> 01:44:13.981 region:rollup2
BILLION BY BROUGH BY FULLER AND

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:15.850 region:rollup2
LEAD.

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:16.717 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT THE SCHOOLS AND

01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:18.552 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS RECEIVING

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:19.386 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS DOING THE

01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:21.722 region:rollup2
INITIAL TWO YEARS OF LOCAL

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:23.190 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DIDN'T

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:24.558 region:rollup2
GAUGING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:26.093 region:rollup2
THAT PARALLELS GAINS IN STUDENT

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:27.461 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT. COMPARED WITH

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:29.363 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IN ALMOST IDENTICAL

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:30.064 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS NOT RECEIVING

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:30.998 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION GRANTS

01:44:30.064 --> 01:44:33.134 region:rollup2
THESE BENEFITS WERE LARGELY

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE BY LATINO STUDENTS

01:44:33.134 --> 01:44:36.704 region:rollup2
AND NOT BY OTHER GROUPS AS

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LEVELS BUT THEY ALSO

01:44:36.704 --> 01:44:40.407 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THERE THAT QUOTE THE

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:41.775 region:rollup2
INABILITY TO DETECT GAINS FOR

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:43.244 region:rollup2
BLACK STUDENTS IS WORTH SOME.

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.712 region:rollup2
THESE EARLY FINDINGS SUGGEST%

01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:46.080 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT ELSE CFF SUPPLEMENTS

01:44:44.712 --> 01:44:48.382 region:rollup2
MAY BE IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.884 region:rollup2
LATINO STUDENTS AS INTENDED A

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:51.352 region:rollup2
NOTABLE GAP REMAINS FOR AFRICAN

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:52.186 region:rollup2
AMERICAN STUDENTS.

01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:53.487 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THERE ARE THREE

01:44:52.186 --> 01:44:55.322 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AFRICAN

PUT IN SIXTY THOUSAND ARE

01:44:56.257 --> 01:44:59.793 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT

01:44:57.725 --> 01:45:01.395 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME. ELL

IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC

PERFORMANCE.

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:13.240 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE ONLY GROUP OF

01:45:11.839 --> 01:45:14.441 region:rollup2

HAS IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT IS

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.056 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY. WORTHY OF FURTHER

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:43.290 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

01:47:42.056 --> 01:47:43.958 region:rollup2

01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:50.264 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:47:48.095 --> 01:47:52.666 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHERE THE AREAS OF

01:47:50.264 --> 01:47:54.401 region:rollup2
GREATEST NEED FALL OUTSIDE OF

THE CATEGORIES THAT GENERALLY

GENERATE A SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING.

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:58.639 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROVIDE INCREASED

01:47:57.304 --> 01:48:00.407 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:02.810 region:rollup2

SUBGROUP OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:40.274 region:rollup2
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS?

01:49:38.439 --> 01:49:41.642 region:rollup2
WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT OF

THIS PROPOSAL.

01:49:41.642 --> 01:49:44.945 region:rollup2
I WANT TO MAKE A FEW.

01:49:43.210 --> 01:49:46.346 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS TO THE PROPOSAL.

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:48.415 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CRITICS OF THIS

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:50.317 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL HAS BEEN. THAT IT WOULD

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:52.820 region:rollup2
CREATE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE.

01:49:50.317 --> 01:49:54.755 region:rollup2
IT TO A INTENTIONALLY HAVE

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.423 region:rollup2
STUDENTS UNDERPERFORM IN ORDER

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:58.759 region:rollup2
TO GET THE RESOURCES.

01:49:56.423 --> 01:50:00.260 region:rollup2
AM I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT

01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:01.895 region:rollup2
WE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.896 region:rollup2
NOT THE CASE.

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:04.598 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT WERE THE CASE IN THAT

01:50:02.896 --> 01:50:06.233 region:rollup2
WOULD UNDERMINE THE REASON FOR

01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:08.469 region:rollup2
HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS FOR

01:50:06.233 --> 01:50:10.037 region:rollup2
ANY SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS.

01:50:08.469 --> 01:50:12.372 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THIS

01:50:10.037 --> 01:50:14.741 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL. UP WOULD HAVE THE

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:16.276 region:rollup2
INITIAL SUBGROUP IT'S IDENTIFIED

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:18.245 region:rollup2
FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:20.380 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

01:50:18.245 --> 01:50:22.850 region:rollup2
FUNDING UNTIL THEIR PERFORMANCE.

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.817 region:rollup2
MATCHES MATCHES THE PERFORMANCE

01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:25.886 region:rollup2
OF THE HIGHEST PERFORMING SUB

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:26.119 region:rollup2
GROUP SO THERE IS A CONCERN

01:50:25.886 --> 01:50:29.022 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:29.556 region:rollup2
AT HAVING A DISINCENTIVE TO

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:31.859 region:rollup2
CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:33.127 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROVIDES AN

01:50:31.859 --> 01:50:34.895 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO CLOSE THE

01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:36.230 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:38.966 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:40.868 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THIS BILL IDENTIFIES

01:50:38.966 --> 01:50:42.769 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NOT BY THEIR SUBGROUP.

01:50:40.868 --> 01:50:44.571 region:rollup2
BUT BY THEIR ACADEMIC

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:44.905 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:46.573 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:50:44.905 --> 01:50:47.941 region:rollup2
.

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:48.709 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAVE

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:50.511 region:rollup2
HAVE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:53.113 region:rollup2
INVISIBILITY.

01:50:50.511 --> 01:50:54.448 region:rollup2
WE'RE AT HAS BEEN HANDS OFF IN

01:50:57.084 --> 01:51:00.120 region:rollup2
AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:00.921 region:rollup2
CALCIFIED.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.389 region:rollup2
STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AT THE

01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:05.058 region:rollup2

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:31.304 region:rollup2
EFFECT THAT WE ALSO HAVE. FULL

01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:32.739 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TRANSPARENCY

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:34.140 region:rollup2
MEASURES I YOU KNOW THE

01:58:32.739 --> 01:58:35.375 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.876 region:rollup2
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MORE

01:58:35.375 --> 01:58:39.145 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY ONLY ONLY TO BE

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:40.580 region:rollup2
TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT. TELL

01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:42.449 region:rollup2
ALL CF GRAPH IS FULLY FUNDED

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:45.318 region:rollup2
WILL THIS IS THE YEAR THAT FULLY

01:58:42.449 --> 01:58:45.952 region:rollup2
FUNDED IS BEING FULL FUNDING OF

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:48.054 region:rollup2
AUSSIE THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED.

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:50.223 region:rollup2
SO WE ABSOLUTELY EXPECT THAT WE

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:52.025 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE DIED NO FULL FUNDING

01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:53.727 region:rollup2
WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY AND

01:58:52.025 --> 01:58:55.662 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES.

01:58:53.727 --> 01:58:57.731 region:rollup2
FULLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'VE

01:58:55.662 --> 01:58:59.532 region:rollup2
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR OVER THIS

01:58:57.731 --> 01:59:01.968 region:rollup2
LAST A COUPLE YEARS.

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:03.470 region:rollup2
SO THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE.

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:05.205 region:rollup2
AGAIN DOCTOR WEBER KEEPING HER

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:07.173 region:rollup2
EYES ON THE PRIZE AND STAYING

01:59:05.205 --> 01:59:08.675 region:rollup2
VERY FOCUSED ON OUR CHILDREN AND

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:09.809 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE. THAT.

01:59:08.675 --> 01:59:11.177 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE KIDS THAT ARE

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:12.579 region:rollup2
BEING THE PRINT THAT WE FIND

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:13.146 region:rollup2
WAYS TO KIND OF BRING BRING THEM

01:59:12.579 --> 01:59:14.447 region:rollup2
UP.

01:59:13.146 --> 01:59:18.184 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:20.854 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:23.423 region:rollup2
SMART. HEATH RAISING YOUR HAND

01:59:20.854 --> 01:59:27.293 region:rollup2
NOW TRIAL YES YES OKAY AYE AYE

01:59:23.423 --> 01:59:27.761 region:rollup2
IT'S OF A QUESTION. I GUESS IS

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:28.194 region:rollup2
FOR DOCTOR WEBER BUT.

01:59:27.761 --> 01:59:29.663 region:rollup2
HOW IS?

01:59:28.194 --> 01:59:30.397 region:rollup2
SUB GROUP DEFINED.

01:59:29.663 --> 01:59:31.598 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK.

01:59:30.397 --> 01:59:33.533 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE HAD SOME

01:59:31.598 --> 01:59:35.502 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY DEFINED SUBGROUPS

01:59:33.533 --> 01:59:36.703 region:rollup2
BASED ON ETHNICITY AT WHICH IN

01:59:35.502 --> 01:59:37.871 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS WE'VE IDENTIFIED

01:59:36.703 --> 01:59:40.173 region:rollup2
ALREADY TALKED AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:41.174 region:rollup2
AND. HISPANICS API YOU KNOW SO

01:59:40.173 --> 01:59:42.742 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE COLLECT THAT DATA

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:44.244 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DISAGGREGATED DATA WE

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:45.445 region:rollup2
DISAGGREGATED BASED ON WHAT WHAT

01:59:44.244 --> 01:59:46.880 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:59:45.445 --> 01:59:48.882 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES AS THAT THAT'S SUB

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:50.083 region:rollup2
GROUPS THEMSELVES. ARE GENERALLY

01:59:48.882 --> 01:59:52.185 region:rollup2
I GUESS THEY LOOK AT CULTURAL

01:59:50.083 --> 01:59:53.853 region:rollup2
IDENTITY SO FORTH AND SO ON AS

01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:55.055 region:rollup2
THE AS THE DEFECATION A PICKUP

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:58.058 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

01:59:55.055 --> 02:00:01.428 region:rollup2
SO DO THE.

01:59:58.058 --> 02:00:02.896 region:rollup2
THE END. UP THERE THE. CTA.

02:00:01.428 --> 02:00:04.431 region:rollup2
MENTIONED SPECIAL EDUCATION IS

02:00:02.896 --> 02:00:04.931 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

02:00:04.431 --> 02:00:07.400 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AS A POTENTIAL

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:08.301 region:rollup2
SUBGROUP.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.070 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE GOT A WE'VE

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:12.005 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE FACT THAT WE THIS

02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:13.006 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT SAID THIS WOULD IT WE

02:00:12.005 --> 02:00:14.841 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING AT THE SUBGROUPS

02:00:13.006 --> 02:00:16.209 region:rollup2
TAKING OUT SPECIAL LITTLE IN

02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:17.744 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SUBGROUPS BECAUSE.

02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:19.446 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SPECIAL KINDS OF THINGS

02:00:17.744 --> 02:00:20.547 region:rollup2
WE DO IN SPECIAL ED THAT OF A

02:00:19.446 --> 02:00:21.114 region:rollup2
LITTLE DIFFERENT AND WHAT WE DO

02:00:20.547 --> 02:00:23.616 region:rollup2
IN REGULAR ED IN TERMS OF

02:00:21.114 --> 02:00:25.351 region:rollup2
FUNDING. AND THAT CLEARLY WE DO

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:26.419 region:rollup2
NOT FUND SPECIAL THAT ENOUGH.

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:28.121 region:rollup2
AND ALL AND MOST OF US

02:00:26.419 --> 02:00:30.156 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THAT AND

02:00:28.121 --> 02:00:31.091 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:32.726 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS STATE

02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:34.260 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS REGARDING. THE

02:00:32.726 --> 02:00:36.529 region:rollup2
FUNDING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:38.565 region:rollup2
SO IS SUB GROUP DIDN'T MIND IN

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:42.335 region:rollup2
ANY WAY OTHER THAN BY RACE OR

02:00:38.565 --> 02:00:44.237 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY.

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:45.572 region:rollup2
AB WELL I AM SURE THAT MANY WAYS

02:00:44.237 --> 02:00:47.207 region:rollup2
THAT WE LOOK AT SUB GROUPS AND

02:00:45.572 --> 02:00:48.441 region:rollup2
IN THE END NOT IN TERMS TO LOOK

02:00:47.207 --> 02:00:49.375 region:rollup2
AT LOOK AT GENDER.

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:50.577 region:rollup2
OF MALE FEMALE WILL BE TALKING

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:51.778 region:rollup2
ABOUT DIFFERENT AREAS OF MOST

02:00:50.577 --> 02:00:53.780 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHEN THEY DISAGGREGATED

02:00:51.778 --> 02:00:55.315 region:rollup2
DATA DISAGGREGATED IN A NUMBER

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.950 region:rollup2
OF WAYS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY

02:00:55.315 --> 02:00:58.251 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHEN WE LOOK AT US STEM

02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:59.853 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:00:58.251 --> 02:01:01.488 region:rollup2
WE NOT ONLY DO IT BASED ON

02:00:59.853 --> 02:01:03.823 region:rollup2
GENDER BUT WE ALSO DO IT BASED

02:01:01.488 --> 02:01:05.225 region:rollup2
ON ETHNICITIES OF THAT OF THEIR

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:07.293 region:rollup2
SOUL OUT WE LOOK TO SEE WITH

02:01:05.225 --> 02:01:09.562 region:rollup2
THEIR DISPARITIES AND SOMETIMES

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:11.631 region:rollup2
IT MAKES SENSE THAT DOM. WE HAVE

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:13.433 region:rollup2
A WHOLE OF A GENDER ISSUE THAT

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:14.801 region:rollup2
WE PUT INTO THE CATEGORIES

02:01:13.433 --> 02:01:15.835 region:rollup2
SOMETIME TO THE AREA OF MATH AND

02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:18.271 region:rollup2
SCIENCE WE DO.

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:19.305 region:rollup2
BUT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T DO THAT

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:21.040 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:22.509 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY THAT

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.844 region:rollup2
THIS IS A. THIS IS A SUB GROUP

02:01:22.509 --> 02:01:26.012 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS A FOCUS OF WHAT WE DID

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:27.347 region:rollup2
WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WAS

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:28.348 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE

02:01:27.347 --> 02:01:30.450 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY RECEIVED

02:01:28.348 --> 02:01:32.018 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. A LOCALLY AND

02:01:30.450 --> 02:01:32.752 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE REGARDING WHAT THE

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:34.888 region:rollup2
VARIOUS.

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:36.823 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ARE IN OUR IT

02:01:34.888 --> 02:01:38.191 region:rollup2
CODE IDENTIFIES ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

02:01:36.823 --> 02:01:40.059 region:rollup2
AS WELL IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF

02:01:38.191 --> 02:01:41.828 region:rollup2
NOT GAPS BUT IDENTIFIES THE

02:01:40.059 --> 02:01:42.929 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES THAT OF THE YEAR.

02:01:41.828 --> 02:01:44.197 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE ETHNIC GROUPS THAT

02:01:42.929 --> 02:01:45.932 region:rollup2
CAN BE SO SO ECONOMIC THEY CAN

02:01:44.197 --> 02:01:47.901 region:rollup2
BE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ALL

02:01:45.932 --> 02:01:49.636 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED. A

02:01:47.901 --> 02:01:50.603 region:rollup2
MOST OF YOU KNOW WOOD BEGAN WITH

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:52.972 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE LC OF PFAFF WE.

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:55.475 region:rollup2
WE ENDED UP WITH THESE GROUPS

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:57.744 region:rollup2
THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE

02:01:55.475 --> 02:02:00.413 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT GROUPS THAT SHOWED A

02:01:57.744 --> 02:02:02.782 region:rollup2
A DISPARITY IN TERMS OF

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:06.419 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT AND THEY GENERALLY

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:08.321 region:rollup2
WORK ITS WILL FOSTER CARE. ARE

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:10.256 region:rollup2
KIDS WHO ARE HOMELESS OF BECAUSE

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:11.958 region:rollup2
OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC SITUATIONS

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:13.660 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BUT

02:02:11.958 --> 02:02:16.930 region:rollup2
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS

02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:18.898 region:rollup2
ETHNICITIES AS WELL WE ALSO LOOK

02:02:16.930 --> 02:02:20.934 region:rollup2
INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:25.238 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WAS A PART OF IT.

02:02:20.934 --> 02:02:30.777 region:rollup2
YOU REMEMBER ORIGINALLY THIS LC

02:02:25.238 --> 02:02:31.211 region:rollup2
FF DID NOT TALK BUT ENGLISH

02:02:30.777 --> 02:02:31.678 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE LEARNERS.

02:02:31.211 --> 02:02:32.812 region:rollup2
BUT TALK ABOUT ENGLISH

02:02:31.678 --> 02:02:34.914 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY.

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:36.182 region:rollup2
AND IF WE KEPT THAT LANGUAGE WE

02:02:34.914 --> 02:02:37.383 region:rollup2
PRIDE WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THIS

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:38.218 region:rollup2
LOWEST ACHIEVING GROUP THAT DOES

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:39.485 region:rollup2
NOT FALL INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE

02:02:38.218 --> 02:02:41.087 region:rollup2
LEARNERS BUT DOES FALL INTO THE

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:41.754 region:rollup2
CATEGORY OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.

02:02:41.087 --> 02:02:42.188 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE ALL THAT BIG AGAIN

02:02:41.754 --> 02:02:46.993 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION WAS IS.

02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:49.162 region:rollup2
SO STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS

02:02:46.993 --> 02:02:50.763 region:rollup2
PUPILS WITH DISABILITIES FOSTER

02:02:49.162 --> 02:02:51.965 region:rollup2
YOUTH AND HOMELESS YOU.

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:53.433 region:rollup2
OKAY AND WE ALSO AS I SAID

02:02:51.965 --> 02:02:55.134 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES LOOK AT SUB GROUPS

02:02:53.433 --> 02:02:56.669 region:rollup2
BASED ON GENDER. MEN THAT'S

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:59.005 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'VE ADDED ALSO SO

02:02:56.669 --> 02:03:00.506 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE SUBGROUPS.

02:02:59.005 --> 02:03:01.975 region:rollup2
WELL THANK YOU I I HAVE A FEW A

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.609 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AS WELL AND AND YOU

02:03:01.975 --> 02:03:04.143 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE

02:03:02.609 --> 02:03:04.711 region:rollup2
NEEDLE HERE BETWEEN POLICY AND

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:06.145 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND SO IS THE BUDGET

02:03:04.711 --> 02:03:07.714 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:10.950 region:rollup2
HAD ON AYE I THINK THIS IS A

02:03:07.714 --> 02:03:14.254 region:rollup2
WORTHY. UP PROPOSAL IT I THINK

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:16.256 region:rollup2
AS YOU AS WAS ALLUDED TO DROP BY

02:03:14.254 --> 02:03:16.456 region:rollup2
YOU AND AND ART TO US SPEAKERS

02:03:16.256 --> 02:03:16.890 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:03:16.456 --> 02:03:18.258 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

02:03:16.890 --> 02:03:19.092 region:rollup2
.

02:03:18.258 --> 02:03:20.493 region:rollup2
WE WE MAY MISS WHEN ELSE IF THAT

02:03:19.092 --> 02:03:21.794 region:rollup2
WAS CREATED AND AND I THINK YOU

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:23.196 region:rollup2
KNOW E NEED TO TAKE A LOOK BACK

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:24.664 region:rollup2
AND SEE WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:03:23.196 --> 02:03:26.032 region:rollup2
OUT THERE SO I THINK. TO THE

02:03:24.664 --> 02:03:27.567 region:rollup2
EXTENT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:03:26.032 --> 02:03:29.269 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING HERE IT'S THE

02:03:27.567 --> 02:03:30.770 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY. A

02:03:29.269 --> 02:03:32.705 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:34.040 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WHEN WE GO

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:36.042 region:rollup2
AND FEEL THAT LOGISTICS A

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.010 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT AND THE OTHER

02:03:36.042 --> 02:03:39.379 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OF COURSE BUT THAT'S

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:41.681 region:rollup2
WHEN I BRING UP TO TWO ISSUES.

02:03:39.379 --> 02:03:43.850 region:rollup2
ONE AS FAR AS THE SUBGROUP. AND

02:03:41.681 --> 02:03:46.819 region:rollup2
I I THINK IF YOU IF YOU LOOK FOR

02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:50.089 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE AT THAT THAT.

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:50.823 region:rollup2
THE HANDOUT I THINK THAT THE

02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:51.524 region:rollup2
LASSEN AND I'M.

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.926 region:rollup2
THE LAST SPEAKER GIVE US WHEN WE

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:54.460 region:rollup2
LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE. THE THE

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.795 region:rollup2
ASIAN SUBGROUPS SCORE VERY HIGH

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:58.498 region:rollup2
BUT ASIAN A FEW DISAGGREGATED

02:03:55.795 --> 02:04:00.466 region:rollup2
ASIAN. LOT OF LOT LOT OF A.

02:03:58.498 --> 02:04:01.901 region:rollup2
VARIETY THERE AND SO I KNOW IN

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:03.836 region:rollup2
MY FOR EXAMPLE.

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:05.038 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN SPECIMEN

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:07.373 region:rollup2
FORMER CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT

02:04:05.038 --> 02:04:08.441 region:rollup2
THAT LARGE API POPULATION AND.

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:10.043 region:rollup2
.

02:04:08.441 --> 02:04:12.812 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY SOUTHEAST ASIAN

02:04:10.043 --> 02:04:14.681 region:rollup2
VIETNAMESE MONG MANH LAOTIAN.

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:16.683 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS SUBGROUP VERY

02:04:14.681 --> 02:04:18.584 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THAT THAT ASIAN

02:04:16.683 --> 02:04:19.686 region:rollup2
SUB GROUP AS A WHOLE AND SO. HE

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:22.922 region:rollup2
WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT

02:04:19.686 --> 02:04:24.223 region:rollup2
WE COULD THIS PROPOSAL LOOK AT.

02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:25.558 region:rollup2
THE SUBGROUP WITHIN THE

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.926 region:rollup2
SUBGROUP ON US ON THE RIGHT

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:28.962 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY THERE BUT BUT

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:31.764 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DIS AGGREGATE SOME

02:04:28.962 --> 02:04:33.566 region:rollup2
OF THE AND THE ETHNIC CATEGORIES

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:34.567 region:rollup2
IN IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I I

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:37.236 region:rollup2
VENTURE TO SAY THAT MAYBE THERE

02:04:34.567 --> 02:04:38.471 region:rollup2
ARE SOME SCHOOLS THAT. THAT ARE

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:39.872 region:rollup2
ARE VERY SIMILAR.

02:04:38.471 --> 02:04:41.474 region:rollup2
IN THAT. IT WAS YOU'RE

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:42.442 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT I WHEN I WAS

02:04:41.474 --> 02:04:43.409 region:rollup2
ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IN SAN DIEGO

02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:44.043 region:rollup2
THE WHICH HAS A LARGE API

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:46.346 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:48.448 region:rollup2
WE DID DISAGGREGATED DATA.

02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:48.948 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND OF COURSE THAT ARE

02:04:48.448 --> 02:04:50.917 region:rollup2
AMONG.

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:51.818 region:rollup2
AT THE HEAD LOW ACHIEVEMENT IN

02:04:50.917 --> 02:04:53.519 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT MAY BE

02:04:51.818 --> 02:04:55.188 region:rollup2
SMALL BUT THEY HAVE SPECIAL

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:56.689 region:rollup2
NEEDS NOT YOU REMEMBER.

02:04:55.188 --> 02:04:58.124 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I THINK

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:59.826 region:rollup2
THOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA HAS

02:04:58.124 --> 02:05:02.762 region:rollup2
BEEN TRYING TO DISAGGREGATED

02:04:59.826 --> 02:05:04.897 region:rollup2
DATA. TO THE OPPOSITION OF THE

02:05:02.762 --> 02:05:06.699 region:rollup2
API COMMUNITY THAT DID NOT WANT

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:07.967 region:rollup2
THE DISAGGREGATED DATA. SOME OF

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:09.802 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM MAY BUT WAS REALLY

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:12.338 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW AND I SPOKE IN FAVOR

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:14.941 region:rollup2
OF IT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE. THAT

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:16.309 region:rollup2
ALL SOMETIMES GROUPS OF OF OF

02:05:14.941 --> 02:05:17.810 region:rollup2
OUR.

02:05:16.309 --> 02:05:18.811 region:rollup2
I CAN'T GUARDS CATEGORIZE VERY

02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:20.813 region:rollup2
LARGE AND AS A RESULT YOU MISS

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:21.481 region:rollup2
SOME GROUPS OF OVERUSE AT ANNA

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.448 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD NOT PREVENT THAT

02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:23.916 region:rollup2
FROM HAPPENING THIS WOULD NOT

02:05:22.448 --> 02:05:25.852 region:rollup2
PREVENT IT FROM. FROM BASICALLY

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:27.186 region:rollup2
GETTING DOWN TO IF WE IF WE HAVE

02:05:25.852 --> 02:05:28.621 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED A GROUP THAT IS

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:30.757 region:rollup2
REALLY PERSISTENTLY A LOW

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:31.724 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING GROUP THAT WE HAVE

02:05:30.757 --> 02:05:33.359 region:rollup2
DIDN'T MEET BEEN THAT'S WHAT

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:34.660 region:rollup2
ELSE HE UP UP WAS ABOUT TO GO

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:36.396 region:rollup2
GET THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.663 region:rollup2
CLEARLY ABA A WE WANT EVERY

02:05:36.396 --> 02:05:38.998 region:rollup2
STUDENT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:41.334 region:rollup2
TO LEARN AND IF THEY'RE IN A

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:43.136 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED VERY LOW SUB GROUP

02:05:41.334 --> 02:05:44.837 region:rollup2
THAT'S THERE THAT'S PERSISTENTLY

02:05:43.136 --> 02:05:46.406 region:rollup2
LOW WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:47.907 region:rollup2
NEED TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO

02:05:46.406 --> 02:05:48.841 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE'VE HAD THIS

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:50.510 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE IN THIS CONVERSATION

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:52.178 region:rollup2
AMONG WHAT WE CONSIDER AFRICAN

02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:53.546 region:rollup2
INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS AND

02:05:52.178 --> 02:05:55.181 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND

02:05:53.546 --> 02:05:57.116 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THE AFTER THAT

02:05:55.181 --> 02:05:58.985 region:rollup2
CATEGORY AFRICAN AMERICAN HIDES

02:05:57.116 --> 02:06:00.186 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FAILURE IN AFRICAN

02:05:58.985 --> 02:06:01.821 region:rollup2
AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN THIS

02:06:00.186 --> 02:06:02.655 region:rollup2
COUNTRY VERSUS THOSE WHO COME

02:06:01.821 --> 02:06:04.424 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:06.059 region:rollup2
AND IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE A LARGE

02:06:04.424 --> 02:06:07.960 region:rollup2
OUT IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF

02:06:06.059 --> 02:06:09.395 region:rollup2
AFRICANS. AND WE HAD TO

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:11.330 region:rollup2
DISAGGREGATED DATA IN SAN DIEGO

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:12.532 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:14.400 region:rollup2
REALLY MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL

02:06:12.532 --> 02:06:14.967 region:rollup2
OF OUR STUDENTS AND OFTENTIMES

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.169 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:17.804 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:06:16.169 --> 02:06:19.572 region:rollup2
ALL THEIR LIVES WHO BORNEO

02:06:17.804 --> 02:06:21.174 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS WEIRD

02:06:19.572 --> 02:06:22.642 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING LOWER THAN STUDENTS

02:06:21.174 --> 02:06:24.177 region:rollup2
WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED HERE WHO

02:06:22.642 --> 02:06:25.545 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE BEEN GOT THE BENEFIT OF

02:06:24.177 --> 02:06:26.979 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME BILINGUAL EDUCATION

02:06:25.545 --> 02:06:29.248 region:rollup2
MONEY. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:29.749 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS AND SO I I'VE

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:31.451 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN OPPOSED US

02:06:29.749 --> 02:06:32.919 region:rollup2
DISAGGREGATED DATA TO GET TO

02:06:31.451 --> 02:06:33.986 region:rollup2
WHERE. YOU'VE WE'VE DISCOVERED

02:06:32.919 --> 02:06:35.688 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A GROUP THAT'S

02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:37.557 region:rollup2
UNFAIRLY THAT WOULD NOT MEETING

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:39.959 region:rollup2
THEIR NEEDS YES WE NEED TO DO

02:06:37.557 --> 02:06:41.994 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THAT

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:44.564 region:rollup2
THAT DATA. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:48.534 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE GO DOWN THIS.

02:06:44.564 --> 02:06:50.236 region:rollup2
THIS PATH AND AND DO THAT'S

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:51.204 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO STICK

02:06:50.236 --> 02:06:51.804 region:rollup2
CENTER IS IS TAKING A LOOK AT

02:06:51.204 --> 02:06:53.139 region:rollup2
HOW WE ADDRESS.

02:06:51.804 --> 02:06:54.106 region:rollup2
THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AND I JUST

02:06:53.139 --> 02:06:55.141 region:rollup2
WANT TO ASK FOR.

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.209 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

PRETEND TO PIN YOU DOWN THAT

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:02.348 region:rollup2

LEGISLATURE.

02:07:04.517 --> 02:07:06.819 region:rollup2
.

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:12.325 region:rollup2
DODD DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S ONE.

02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:13.025 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S UP THAT WE COULD THAT

02:07:12.325 --> 02:07:14.961 region:rollup2
THIS OR THAT WE COULD DO IT THAT

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:16.095 region:rollup2
IS A PRACTICAL WAY TO DO IT AND

02:07:14.961 --> 02:07:17.797 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE WITH THERE'S AN

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:20.199 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE. LEGAL

STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU

NIGTS A FOR THAT WHAT THE

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:25.705 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS. WHAT WOULD THAT BE

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:27.206 region:rollup2
LAWFUL?

02:07:25.705 --> 02:07:28.908 region:rollup2
I AM.

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:30.610 region:rollup2
HONESTLY IT AT THIS POINT.

02:07:28.908 --> 02:07:31.978 region:rollup2
I I DON'T THINK THAT WE AS

02:07:30.610 --> 02:07:33.779 region:rollup2
FINANCE OF HAVE ENOUGH

02:07:31.978 --> 02:07:35.681 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH.

THAT PRACTICABILITY.

02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:40.086 region:rollup2
OF IT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY

02:07:39.085 --> 02:07:41.287 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO

02:07:40.086 --> 02:07:42.622 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT I MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE

02:07:41.287 --> 02:07:43.956 region:rollup2
BILL AS WRITTEN AND I THINK

02:07:42.622 --> 02:07:45.591 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOME TECHNICAL

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:46.192 region:rollup2
ISSUES THERE BUT AGAIN HAVEN'T

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:47.994 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT

02:07:46.192 --> 02:07:49.896 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES ENOUGH THE. DEPARTMENT

02:07:47.994 --> 02:07:51.197 region:rollup2
OF ED MAY BE ABLE TO A PINE WITH

IT WE DO HAVE SOME SOME

02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:00.406 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THAT I

02:07:59.472 --> 02:08:02.341 region:rollup2
THINK IF THERE IS A WILL TO MOVE

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:03.943 region:rollup2
FORWARD THEN WE WOULD BE HAPPY.

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:05.645 region:rollup2

ANY CA AND SO I I THINK IT IN

02:22:10.022 --> 02:22:13.158 region:rollup2
THIS IN THIS AYE REALM AYE THINK

02:22:11.490 --> 02:22:13.892 region:rollup2
THE AT THE APPROPRIATE SEPARATE

02:22:13.158 --> 02:22:17.729 region:rollup2
POLLS WILL BE FOREST'S IS

02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:20.165 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT. A ONE TIME.

02:22:17.729 --> 02:22:22.100 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION OKAY GRIP AND

02:22:20.165 --> 02:22:23.268 region:rollup2
APARTMENT VAN HOW WHAT DO YOU

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:25.070 region:rollup2
THINK AND IF WE WERE TO.

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:26.104 region:rollup2
FUND THIS HOW MUCH WOULD IT TAKE

02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:27.372 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS A GRANT OR A ONE TIME

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:29.708 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:22:27.372 --> 02:22:31.476 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU GUYS HAD A CHANCE LOOK

02:22:29.708 --> 02:22:32.344 region:rollup2
AT IT FOR HOW YOU DO IT. I THINK

02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:32.944 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT MR

02:22:32.344 --> 02:22:33.512 region:rollup2
MCCARTY SAID AROUND TAKING A

02:22:32.944 --> 02:22:34.146 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT RESOURCES ARE

02:22:33.512 --> 02:22:35.547 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS

02:22:34.146 --> 02:22:36.848 region:rollup2
APPROACH COULD BE SCALABLE BASED

02:22:35.547 --> 02:22:38.517 region:rollup2
ON HOW MUCH RESOURCES ARE

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:39.718 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT

02:22:38.517 --> 02:22:41.887 region:rollup2
IT. WILL LOOK AT IS TWO FOLD

02:22:39.718 --> 02:22:43.555 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT THE IDEALLY I'M

02:22:41.887 --> 02:22:44.222 region:rollup2
GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

02:22:43.555 --> 02:22:46.291 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN ONE TIME GRANTS BUT

02:22:44.222 --> 02:22:47.559 region:rollup2
ALSO WHAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:49.461 region:rollup2
IS THE FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOL

02:22:47.559 --> 02:22:50.695 region:rollup2
CLIMATE SURVEYS SO WE THINK THAT

02:22:49.461 --> 02:22:51.797 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:55.067 region:rollup2
THAT. SO THAT WOULD BE FUNDING

02:22:51.797 --> 02:22:56.334 region:rollup2
FOR ANNUAL SURVEYS FOUR I'M.

02:22:55.067 --> 02:22:57.335 region:rollup2
FOOT FOR DISTRICTS TO

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:58.870 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THE SURVEY SO WE WE

02:22:57.335 --> 02:23:01.406 region:rollup2
WOULD TRY TO TRY TO AT LEAST

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:02.107 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT AS PART OF AN ONGOING

02:23:01.406 --> 02:23:03.241 region:rollup2
AND THEN LOOKING AT THAT THE ONE

02:23:02.107 --> 02:23:04.976 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATS I KNOW THAT DOESN'T

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:06.812 region:rollup2
ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT I THINK.

02:23:04.976 --> 02:23:09.881 region:rollup2
WE COULD LOOK AT THIS APPROACH

02:23:06.812 --> 02:23:12.918 region:rollup2
IS IS BEING YOU KNOW AS LITTLE

02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:13.718 region:rollup2
AS AVAILABLE IN AS MUCH AS AS IS

02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:15.487 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

02:23:13.718 --> 02:23:17.055 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK WHEN WE LAST WEEK

02:23:15.487 --> 02:23:18.990 region:rollup2
WE HAD OF FOR. ONE OF OUR BUDGET

02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:21.860 region:rollup2
MEANS WE'RE LOOKING AT SCHOOL

02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:22.627 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AT RISK IN THEIR SAN.

02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:24.029 region:rollup2
WHEN TO TAKE WAYS I TOOK WAS

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:25.297 region:rollup2
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT.

02:23:24.029 --> 02:23:26.531 region:rollup2
DEVELOP WELL ON THEIR OWN CAP

02:23:25.297 --> 02:23:27.065 region:rollup2
GENERALLY DON'T HAVE

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:27.566 region:rollup2
FUNDING ISSUES ABLE TO GO

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:27.899 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:23:27.566 --> 02:23:30.202 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:31.736 region:rollup2
DE.

02:23:30.202 --> 02:23:32.270 region:rollup2
MY OWN LOOKING AMOUNT DISTRICTS

02:23:31.736 --> 02:23:34.372 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAID AND

02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:36.541 region:rollup2
ENGAGE.

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:38.376 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES AND HAD

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:40.979 region:rollup2
A VERY ROBUST OUT OF REACH.

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:41.379 region:rollup2
BEEN HAVE IS THE PROBLEM THAT

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:44.049 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DIDN'T

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:46.885 region:rollup2
AND SO I TH.

02:23:44.049 --> 02:23:49.221 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE SEAT SHE HAD THE A

02:23:46.885 --> 02:23:50.055 region:rollup2
PTA IS BIG ON THIS ISSUE AS FAR.

02:23:49.221 --> 02:23:51.089 region:rollup2
FAMILY INVOLVEMENT JUST.

02:23:50.055 --> 02:23:53.391 region:rollup2
BUT EXPAND THE NET.

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:55.026 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK.

02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:56.027 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATE MORE RECOGNIZE THE

02:23:55.026 --> 02:23:59.531 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION WITHIN

02:23:56.027 --> 02:24:01.800 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

02:23:59.531 --> 02:24:02.667 region:rollup2
IT ONLY BE BETTER SERVED WHEN

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:04.736 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED TO TAKE

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:07.672 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP TO EDUCATION.

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:08.573 region:rollup2

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:13.111 region:rollup2

SUPPORT IS HAVING FOR COMPONENT

02:31:44.395 --> 02:31:48.032 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS

02:31:45.997 --> 02:31:48.967 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:50.468 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO

OFFICES TO PROVIDE BETTER

02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:03.614 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TO DISTRICTS.

THIRD PROPOSAL WHICH IS

ESTABLISHING THE CELL PAROLE ON

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:09.554 region:rollup2
THIS COMPONENT PROVIDES TEN

MILLION TO THE COLLABORATIVE TO

ON PAGE THREE AND FOUR OF THE

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:23.468 region:rollup2
HAND UP PROVIDER ASSESSMENTS.

02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:24.769 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE SYSTEM

02:32:23.468 --> 02:32:25.737 region:rollup2
MINIMIZES DISTRICT CHOICE

02:32:24.769 --> 02:32:27.171 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF CAPTURING THE

02:32:25.737 --> 02:32:28.873 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF LOCAL

02:32:27.171 --> 02:32:30.608 region:rollup2
CONTROL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:31.309 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL DISTRICTS MUST RECEIVE

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:33.344 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM THEIR COUNTY

02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:34.445 region:rollup2
OFFICES OF EDUCATION UNLESS THEY

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:36.381 region:rollup2
USE FUNDING TO PURCHASE. TO

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:37.582 region:rollup2
PURCHASE ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT OUR

02:32:36.381 --> 02:32:39.150 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT THE LACK OF

02:32:37.582 --> 02:32:40.318 region:rollup2
CHOICE COULD REDUCE THE QUALITY

02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:41.686 region:rollup2
AND THE TIMELINESS.

02:32:40.318 --> 02:32:43.855 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT THAT A DISTRICT

02:32:41.686 --> 02:32:44.789 region:rollup2
COULD SEE COULD RECEIVE SO WE

02:32:43.855 --> 02:32:47.525 region:rollup2
COULD SEE THIS PLAYING OUT IN A

02:32:44.789 --> 02:32:48.693 region:rollup2
FEW WAYS BUT ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:49.961 region:rollup2
I COUNTY OFFICE COULD LACK OF.

02:32:48.693 --> 02:32:51.629 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE

02:32:49.961 --> 02:32:53.398 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED DISTRICT AND IT WOULD

02:32:51.629 --> 02:32:54.899 region:rollup2
TAKE TIME TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY

02:32:53.398 --> 02:32:56.134 region:rollup2
WHILE THE COUNTY OFFICES

02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:57.201 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE CAPACITY.

02:32:56.134 --> 02:32:58.102 region:rollup2
THE.

02:32:57.201 --> 02:32:59.203 region:rollup2
IF THE COUNTY OFFICE ISN'T

02:32:58.102 --> 02:33:00.438 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE DISTRICT AT THE

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:02.106 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LEVEL OF SUPPORT THE

02:33:00.438 --> 02:33:03.207 region:rollup2
STATE COULD OFFER.

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:04.475 region:rollup2
AND IF THE STATE FINDS A COUNTY

02:33:03.207 --> 02:33:05.777 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS NOT

02:33:04.475 --> 02:33:07.345 region:rollup2
PROVIDING DISTRICTS WITH QUALITY

02:33:05.777 --> 02:33:08.613 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT THE BULK OF THE

02:33:07.345 --> 02:33:10.615 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT ON COUNTY

02:33:08.613 --> 02:33:12.150 region:rollup2
OFFICES OF EDUCATION BUT IT'S ON

02:33:10.615 --> 02:33:12.617 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS BECAUSE THE DISTRICT

02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:13.451 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T WOULD REMAIN

02:33:12.617 --> 02:33:14.952 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:33:13.451 --> 02:33:16.487 region:rollup2
SO WE DO THINK COUNTY OFFICES

02:33:14.952 --> 02:33:17.822 region:rollup2
OUR POSITION TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

02:33:16.487 --> 02:33:19.390 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE THEIR

EXPERTISE IN REVIEWING BUDGET

02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:22.360 region:rollup2
AND EL COPS ON THE COUNTY

02:33:20.591 --> 02:33:23.428 region:rollup2
OFFICES ARE WELL FUNDED TO

02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:25.430 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WHAT WE S.

02:33:23.428 --> 02:33:26.798 region:rollup2

02:33:28.166 --> 02:33:32.170 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING THAT THEY

02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:33.438 region:rollup2
COULD USE A SUPPORT DISTRICTS.

02:33:32.170 --> 02:33:34.472 region:rollup2
A WE CONTINUE OUR ASSESSMENTON

02:33:33.438 --> 02:33:35.540 region:rollup2
PAGE FOUR.

02:33:34.472 --> 02:33:37.408 region:rollup2
BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE

02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:39.010 region:rollup2
REGIONALLY PROPOSAL OUR CONCERN

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:40.378 region:rollup2
IS THAT BOTH SILVA AND COUNTY

02:33:39.010 --> 02:33:42.547 region:rollup2

02:33:42.547 --> 02:33:46.117 region:rollup2
TO BOTH. THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED

EXISTING ROLE THE FOR EXAMPLE

02:33:49.987 --> 02:33:52.490 region:rollup2
ELEVEN COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:33:51.122 --> 02:33:54.025 region:rollup2

02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:55.026 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO SERVE AS REGIONAL

NEEDS.

02:33:55.026 --> 02:33:57.595 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF CLARITY

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:59.964 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THE REGIONAL NEEDS

02:33:57.595 --> 02:34:01.099 region:rollup2
TO FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY REGIONALES

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:02.333 region:rollup2
ARE INTENDED TO BUILD THE

02:34:01.099 --> 02:34:03.968 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF COUNTY OFFICE OF

ALSO TO POST ALSO TO SUPPORT

02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:08.906 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS DIRECTLY AND IT'S

02:34:07.572 --> 02:34:10.575 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR AT WHAT POINT A REGIONAL

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:12.110 region:rollup2
LEGAL SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND HOW

02:34:10.575 --> 02:34:13.544 region:rollup2
DECISIONS TO SUPPORT THE

02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:15.079 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WILL BE MADE.

02:34:13.544 --> 02:34:16.948 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF CLARITY ALSO RAISES

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:18.216 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FOR THE SELF BELIEVES.

02:34:16.948 --> 02:34:19.183 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE PROPOSAL INTENDING

02:34:18.216 --> 02:34:20.451 region:rollup2
TO ADD SELFLESS TO THE

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:22.053 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION OF IMPROVING

02:34:20.451 --> 02:34:23.187 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THE LACK OF CLARITY

02:34:22.053 --> 02:34:24.789 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THE ROLE COULD

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:26.157 region:rollup2
RESULT IN COUNTIES DEFERRING

DISTRICT SUPPORT TO CELL PHONES.

02:34:26.157 --> 02:34:29.660 region:rollup2
DISCONNECTING SPECIAL EDUCATION

PERFORMANCE ISSUES FROM OTHER

OUR GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES

02:34:38.236 --> 02:34:40.872 region:rollup2
SUCH AS TEST SCORES AND

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:42.473 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATES. WE WOULD

02:34:40.872 --> 02:34:43.741 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES

02:34:42.473 --> 02:34:45.409 region:rollup2
AT THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS A

02:34:43.741 --> 02:34:46.511 region:rollup2
GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES THAT

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:48.212 region:rollup2
ARE DICTATED BY THE SAME

02:34:46.511 --> 02:34:48.646 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

02:34:48.212 --> 02:34:50.114 region:rollup2
APPLY TO ALL STUDENT

POPULATIONS.

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:52.450 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE ACADEMIC

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:53.818 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE WITH STUDENTS WITH

02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:55.453 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES IS LARGELY

02:34:53.818 --> 02:34:57.688 region:rollup2
DETERMINED BY GENERAL EDUCATION

02:34:55.453 --> 02:34:58.656 region:rollup2
TEACHERS WHO HAVE STUDENTS WITH

02:34:57.688 --> 02:35:00.024 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:34:58.656 --> 02:35:01.292 region:rollup2
ALL THIS IS A IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:03.227 region:rollup2
TO US WHY WE WOULD HAVE A

02:35:01.292 --> 02:35:04.729 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ENTITY INTERVENING FOR

02:35:03.227 --> 02:35:06.264 region:rollup2
ISSUE SPECIFIC TO STUDENTS WITH

DISABILITIES OTHER RELY ON A

DIFFERENT SOURCE OF EXPERTISE

02:35:07.698 --> 02:35:10.835 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE. SAME ISSUES WHEN THEY

02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:12.837 region:rollup2
OCCUR WITH OTHER STUDENT

02:35:10.835 --> 02:35:14.305 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

02:35:12.837 --> 02:35:16.440 region:rollup2
ON PAGE FIVE AND SIX WE DISCUSS

02:35:14.305 --> 02:35:16.874 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.743 region:rollup2
SO.

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:20.378 region:rollup2
AS I SAID BEFORE COUNTY OFFICES

02:35:18.743 --> 02:35:21.646 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION ARE WELL POSITIONED

02:35:20.378 --> 02:35:22.814 region:rollup2
TO ASSISTANCE TRICKS AND WE

02:35:21.646 --> 02:35:24.048 region:rollup2
THINK COUNTIES COULD CONDUCT A

02:35:22.814 --> 02:35:25.783 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:26.818 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING DISTRICTS.

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:28.119 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE COUNTIES WOULD

02:35:26.818 --> 02:35:29.287 region:rollup2
WORK WITH DISTRICTS AND UNCOVER

02:35:28.119 --> 02:35:31.255 region:rollup2
THE ROOT CAUSES FOR FOR THEIR

02:35:29.287 --> 02:35:33.291 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ISSUES. WHICH WOULD

02:35:31.255 --> 02:35:33.925 region:rollup2
M. ACTUALLY BE SIMILAR TO WHAT

02:35:33.291 --> 02:35:35.893 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY

02:35:33.925 --> 02:35:36.994 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING SO COUNTIES COULD IN

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:38.529 region:rollup2
FACT SUPPORT DISTRICT BEYOND A

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:40.231 region:rollup2
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND HELP

02:35:38.529 --> 02:35:42.333 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS. IMPROVING HELP

02:35:40.231 --> 02:35:43.568 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IMPLEMENTS SOLUTIONS

02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:45.002 region:rollup2
HOWEVER COUNTY OFFICES HAVE

02:35:43.568 --> 02:35:46.070 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:47.605 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND WE RECOMMEND

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:48.773 region:rollup2
AUGMENTING THEIR FUNDING FOR

02:35:47.605 --> 02:35:50.541 region:rollup2
THIS PURPOSE.

02:35:48.773 --> 02:35:52.310 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND REJECTING BOTH

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:54.078 region:rollup2
THE REGIONALLY PROPOSALS BECAUSE

02:35:52.310 --> 02:35:55.713 region:rollup2
CREATING THESE THESE ROLES LEAD

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:57.381 region:rollup2
TO UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION.

02:35:55.713 --> 02:35:58.449 region:rollup2
AHMED ALSO THE SELF RULE COULD

02:35:57.381 --> 02:36:00.051 region:rollup2
SILO SUPPORT INSTEAD OF

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:01.752 region:rollup2
FOSTERING CONVERSATIONS IS

02:36:00.051 --> 02:36:03.955 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION INTENDS.

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:04.555 region:rollup2
ON PAGE SIX WE DISCUSS OUR

02:36:03.955 --> 02:36:07.725 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:36:04.555 --> 02:36:07.725 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL. AND WE SEEING

02:36:07.792 --> 02:36:10.595 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF LCF OFF

02:36:09.527 --> 02:36:11.996 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CREATING ADDITIONAL

02:36:10.595 --> 02:36:12.964 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

02:36:11.996 --> 02:36:14.365 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND USING THE

02:36:12.964 --> 02:36:15.833 region:rollup2
COOPERATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL

02:36:14.365 --> 02:36:17.068 region:rollup2
EXCELLENCE WHICH IS THE NEW

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:18.970 region:rollup2
ENTITY THAT WAS FORMED GENERALLY

02:36:17.068 --> 02:36:20.037 region:rollup2
TO ASSIST DISTRICTS.

02:36:18.970 --> 02:36:21.405 region:rollup2
AS AN ENTITY THAT OPERATES

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:22.773 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO FIX MATCHES THE

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:24.942 region:rollup2
STATE'S FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:25.509 region:rollup2
ENTITY. AND WE RECOGNIZE THIS

02:36:24.942 --> 02:36:27.378 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A CHANGE FROM BOTH

02:36:25.509 --> 02:36:28.646 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW AND WHAT THE STATE

02:36:27.378 --> 02:36:29.547 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:36:28.646 --> 02:36:30.848 region:rollup2
PROPOSES.

02:36:29.547 --> 02:36:32.216 region:rollup2
SO FOR FIGURE OUT ONCE A

02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:33.684 region:rollup2
DISTRICT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:35.519 region:rollup2
THEY NEED FISCAL ASSESSMENT OF

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:37.255 region:rollup2
FISCAL ASSISTANCE FIGMENT

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:37.889 region:rollup2
DEVELOPS A TEAM THAT CAN SUPPORT

02:36:37.255 --> 02:36:40.124 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

02:36:37.889 --> 02:36:41.659 region:rollup2
IN VERY SPECIFIC AREAS SO WE

02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:42.793 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN BUILD OFF THE

02:36:41.659 --> 02:36:43.961 region:rollup2
SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN FACT

02:36:42.793 --> 02:36:45.396 region:rollup2
MATT SUPPORTING DISTRICTS AND

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:46.664 region:rollup2
MODEL THE COLLABORATIVE TO

02:36:45.396 --> 02:36:47.798 region:rollup2
OPERATE SIMILARLY.

02:36:46.664 --> 02:36:49.367 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST STEP OF OUR

02:36:47.798 --> 02:36:50.635 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE IS THAT ANA IDENTIFY

02:36:49.367 --> 02:36:51.636 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WOULD WORK WITH

02:36:50.635 --> 02:36:52.803 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO UNCOVER THE ROOT

02:36:51.636 --> 02:36:54.138 region:rollup2
CAUSE ANALYSIS OF THEIR

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:55.706 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ISSUES AS DISCUSSED

02:36:54.138 --> 02:36:57.141 region:rollup2
EARLIER. SO ONCE THE COUNTY

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:58.676 region:rollup2
COMPLETED THE ROOT CAUSE

02:36:57.141 --> 02:36:59.377 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ADDITION WITH AND WORK

02:36:58.676 --> 02:37:01.045 region:rollup2
WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO

02:36:59.377 --> 02:37:02.880 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY AN EXPERT OR TEAM OF

02:37:01.045 --> 02:37:04.515 region:rollup2
EXPERTS THAT THE DISTRICT COULD

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:06.150 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THAT IT WOULD ADDRESS

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:07.151 region:rollup2
THE ROOT PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:08.986 region:rollup2
THE EXPERTS COULD BE COUNTY

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:10.388 region:rollup2
OFFICES OF EDUCATION DISTRICTS

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:12.523 region:rollup2
OTHER PROVIDERS OF EDUCATION

02:37:10.388 --> 02:37:14.158 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CONSULTANTS THE IDEA

02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:15.693 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE COLLABORATIVE WOULD

02:37:14.158 --> 02:37:17.161 region:rollup2
HAVE EXPERTS UNDER CONTRACT SO

02:37:15.693 --> 02:37:18.562 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN YOU DID EXPERTS WILL

02:37:17.161 --> 02:37:20.031 region:rollup2
BE AVAILABLE FOR THE DISTRICT

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.232 region:rollup2
THAT NEED SUPPORT.

02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:22.867 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDED SYSTEM WOULD

02:37:21.232 --> 02:37:24.969 region:rollup2
PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH GREATER

02:37:22.867 --> 02:37:26.304 region:rollup2
CHOICE IN SELECTING EXPERTS DOES

02:37:24.969 --> 02:37:28.072 region:rollup2
NOT REQUIRE DISTRICTS COULD WORK

02:37:26.304 --> 02:37:28.906 region:rollup2
WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO CHOOSE

02:37:28.072 --> 02:37:30.274 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED EXPERTS ARE BEST

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:31.409 region:rollup2
SUITED TO HELP ADDRESS THE KEY

02:37:30.274 --> 02:37:32.810 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

02:37:31.409 --> 02:37:35.212 region:rollup2
AND DISTRICTS I'M ALREADY HAVE A

02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:36.747 region:rollup2
STRONG INCENTIVE TO CHIU SUPPORT

02:37:35.212 --> 02:37:37.882 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WIRELESS WISELY I'M

02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:39.116 region:rollup2
UNDER STATE LAW THE ULTIMATE

02:37:37.882 --> 02:37:40.251 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY RESIDES WITH

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:42.420 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY'VE REAP

02:37:40.251 --> 02:37:44.288 region:rollup2
FACE REPERCUSSIONS IF.

02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:44.922 region:rollup2
THE FAILED TO IMPROVE ABOVE

02:37:44.288 --> 02:37:46.123 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS FAIL TO IMPROVE THE

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:47.625 region:rollup2
GET INTO INTENSIVE INTERVENTION

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:48.693 region:rollup2
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF POOR

02:37:47.625 --> 02:37:50.127 region:rollup2
DISTRICT PERFORMANCE WHERE THE

02:37:48.693 --> 02:37:51.696 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:53.497 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION PARA CHOIR. BUDGET

02:37:51.696 --> 02:37:55.466 region:rollup2
REVISION THAT AL CAPP PROVISIONS

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:56.200 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS STAY IN RESCIND

02:37:55.466 --> 02:37:57.768 region:rollup2
ABOARD DECISIONS.

02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:59.537 region:rollup2
SO WITH ALL THAT SAID WE PREVENT

02:37:57.768 --> 02:38:00.805 region:rollup2
THIS OPTION TO DISPLAY BUT

02:37:59.537 --> 02:38:02.006 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MODEL FOR

02:38:00.805 --> 02:38:03.908 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LEGSLATURE TO

02:38:02.006 --> 02:38:05.876 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED

02:38:03.908 --> 02:38:06.711 region:rollup2
OUTCOME OF SUPPORTING DISTRICTS.

02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:09.680 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

02:38:06.711 --> 02:38:10.247 region:rollup2
BUT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:11.916 region:rollup2
WOW WE GOT A CONFLICT THAT'S

02:38:10.247 --> 02:38:12.917 region:rollup2
COOL.

02:38:11.916 --> 02:38:15.519 region:rollup2
LET US NOW WELL HERE FOR THE

02:38:12.917 --> 02:38:16.754 region:rollup2
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION DAVID

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:18.122 region:rollup2
SAP AND YOU'RE GONNA.

02:38:16.754 --> 02:38:20.191 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THE. THE CONFLICT HERE

02:38:18.122 --> 02:38:21.292 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:38:20.191 --> 02:38:22.693 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL BE THE TIEBREAKER

02:38:21.292 --> 02:38:23.961 region:rollup2
GASOLINE MORNING DAVID SAT STATE

02:38:22.693 --> 02:38:26.197 region:rollup2
BOARD OF EDUCATION AND I LIKE TO

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:27.665 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THREE POINTS ON FIRST.

02:38:26.197 --> 02:38:28.566 region:rollup2
LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND

02:38:27.665 --> 02:38:30.468 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS BEEN PRETTY

02:38:28.566 --> 02:38:31.168 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

02:38:30.468 --> 02:38:32.603 region:rollup2
OF.

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:34.772 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT OVER

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:36.040 region:rollup2
TIME CONTINUITY. I LARGELY AGREE

02:38:34.772 --> 02:38:37.641 region:rollup2
WITH THE STAFF ANALYSIS IN THIS

02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:38.976 region:rollup2
HOMES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:41.045 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL REFLECTS THE WORK OF

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:42.513 region:rollup2
THE STATE BOARD HAS DONE. TO

02:38:41.045 --> 02:38:44.048 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT ALL CFF

02:38:42.513 --> 02:38:46.684 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE RELIANT TO SOME

02:38:44.048 --> 02:38:47.985 region:rollup2
EXTENT ON RELATIONSHIPS NORMS

02:38:46.684 --> 02:38:49.653 region:rollup2
AND THEY INSERTED BASIC

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:51.022 region:rollup2
OPERATING PRINT PRINCIPLES. THAT

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:52.256 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEVELOPED JOINTLY WITH THE

02:38:51.022 --> 02:38:53.791 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS IN

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:55.760 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING LCF OVER THE LAST

02:38:53.791 --> 02:38:56.727 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS. THE GOVERNOR'S

02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:58.095 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROVIDES IMPORTANT

02:38:56.727 --> 02:38:59.063 region:rollup2
CLARITY AROUND ROLES AND

02:38:58.095 --> 02:39:00.398 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:38:59.063 --> 02:39:01.298 region:rollup2
THEN EXPECTATIONS THAT WE

02:39:00.398 --> 02:39:02.833 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THAT

02:39:01.298 --> 02:39:04.769 region:rollup2
CONTINUITY FOR EDUCATORS AND

02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:05.903 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:39:04.769 --> 02:39:07.905 region:rollup2
WITH FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:39:05.903 --> 02:39:09.240 region:rollup2
LCF OUT. IN A WAY THAT IS QUITE

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:10.741 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM OUR PAST SCHOOL

02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:11.976 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT AFTER.

02:39:10.741 --> 02:39:13.344 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S MY SECOND POINT WHICH

02:39:11.976 --> 02:39:14.845 region:rollup2
IS WHY WE SHOULD WANT TO ENSURE

02:39:13.344 --> 02:39:16.180 region:rollup2
CONTINUITY.

02:39:14.845 --> 02:39:17.281 region:rollup2
A COMMON FEATURE OF OUR PAST

02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:18.783 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SCHOOL

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:20.718 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS WHETHER

02:39:18.783 --> 02:39:22.820 region:rollup2
STATE OR FEDERAL A LAW DROVE

02:39:20.718 --> 02:39:24.155 region:rollup2
THEM WITH IF THEY WERE COMMANDED

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:25.089 region:rollup2
CONTROL APPROACHES.

02:39:24.155 --> 02:39:26.457 region:rollup2
THAT RELIED ON A MIX OF

02:39:25.089 --> 02:39:28.526 region:rollup2
SANCTIONS AND PUNISHMENT AND

02:39:26.457 --> 02:39:30.127 region:rollup2
TIME LIMITED FUNDING.

02:39:28.526 --> 02:39:31.429 region:rollup2
VARIOUS RESEARCH EVALUATIONS OF

02:39:30.127 --> 02:39:33.230 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY

02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:34.265 region:rollup2
FOUND THEY TO NOT LEAD TO

02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:35.733 region:rollup2
IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND

02:39:34.265 --> 02:39:37.435 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO GO TO MORE DETAIL ON

02:39:35.733 --> 02:39:39.470 region:rollup2
THE WISE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

02:39:37.435 --> 02:39:41.639 region:rollup2
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. THAT THE

02:39:39.470 --> 02:39:43.107 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE GAPS THAT WE ARE ALL

02:39:41.639 --> 02:39:44.642 region:rollup2
GREATLY FOCUSED ON TODAY

02:39:43.107 --> 02:39:45.843 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT IN SOME WAYS

02:39:44.642 --> 02:39:47.011 region:rollup2
INCREASED UNDER THOSE EFFORTS ON

02:39:45.843 --> 02:39:48.312 region:rollup2
PASSED.

02:39:47.011 --> 02:39:49.079 region:rollup2
SO THEY DIDN'T REALLY WORK TO

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:49.980 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE'RE

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.916 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH OUR

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:54.351 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY APPROACH.

02:39:51.916 --> 02:39:55.753 region:rollup2
THAT PRIOR SYSTEMS WERE ALSO A

02:39:54.351 --> 02:39:56.954 region:rollup2
THE PERSISTENCE APPROACH TO THE

02:39:55.753 --> 02:39:58.322 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUPPORT WERE

02:39:56.954 --> 02:40:00.291 region:rollup2
ALSO DISJOINTED IS JUST ONE

02:39:58.322 --> 02:40:01.692 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE UNDER TITLE ONE WE

02:40:00.291 --> 02:40:03.494 region:rollup2
CREATED WHICH IS FOR LOW INCOME

02:40:01.692 --> 02:40:05.129 region:rollup2
STUDENTS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. ONE

02:40:03.494 --> 02:40:06.597 region:rollup2
REGIONAL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT YET

02:40:05.129 --> 02:40:07.298 region:rollup2
UNDER TITLE THREE WHICH IS

02:40:06.597 --> 02:40:08.265 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR

02:40:07.298 --> 02:40:09.800 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LEARNERS THERE IS A

02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:11.135 region:rollup2
TOTALLY SEPARATE REGIONAL SYSTEM

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.503 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT. AND THEY'D WANT

02:40:11.135 --> 02:40:14.038 region:rollup2
COORDINATED IN THERE'S NO

02:40:12.503 --> 02:40:15.005 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AMONG THEM SO JUST

02:40:14.038 --> 02:40:16.774 region:rollup2
TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE CONCERN

02:40:15.005 --> 02:40:18.442 region:rollup2
ABOUT CREATING REDUNDANT

02:40:16.774 --> 02:40:19.110 region:rollup2
DUPLICATIVE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT.

02:40:18.442 --> 02:40:20.945 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S

02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:22.613 region:rollup2
TRUE I BELIEVE THIS IS TRYING TO

02:40:20.945 --> 02:40:23.914 region:rollup2
REPLACE WHAT WERE DISJOINTED

02:40:22.613 --> 02:40:25.683 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WITH A SINGLE INTEGRATED

02:40:23.914 --> 02:40:27.618 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WILL BETTER SUPPORT

02:40:25.683 --> 02:40:28.085 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS AND

02:40:27.618 --> 02:40:29.720 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY STUDENTS.

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:31.222 region:rollup2
WHY DOES IT MATTER TO HAVE A

02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:32.156 region:rollup2
COORDINATED SYSTEM

02:40:31.222 --> 02:40:33.991 region:rollup2
STEPHEN CAN BE AN ENGLISH

02:40:32.156 --> 02:40:35.693 region:rollup2
LEARNER OF FOSTER YOUTH AND OLD

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:36.894 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME STUDENT?

02:40:35.693 --> 02:40:38.028 region:rollup2
BUT SHE'S NOT A SET OF LABELS

02:40:36.894 --> 02:40:40.197 region:rollup2
SHE'S A STUDENT WITH PARTICULAR

02:40:38.028 --> 02:40:41.465 region:rollup2
LEARNING NEEDS YET THE SYSTEM OF

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:42.333 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT WE CREATED FOR

02:40:41.465 --> 02:40:44.301 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WAS BASED ON LABELS AND

02:40:42.333 --> 02:40:46.003 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:47.505 region:rollup2
AND THE BURDEN WAS ON DISTRICTS

02:40:46.003 --> 02:40:49.106 region:rollup2
TO RECONCILE AND RATIONALIZES

02:40:47.505 --> 02:40:50.541 region:rollup2
THE SPORTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE

02:40:49.106 --> 02:40:51.876 region:rollup2
TO DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT MET THE

02:40:50.541 --> 02:40:52.877 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS RATHER

02:40:51.876 --> 02:40:53.811 region:rollup2
THAN LABELS.

02:40:52.877 --> 02:40:55.112 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED FROM THAT

02:40:53.811 --> 02:40:58.015 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT

02:40:55.112 --> 02:40:59.416 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT APPROACH IS GOING TO

02:40:58.015 --> 02:41:00.751 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD MAKE A BETTER.

02:40:59.416 --> 02:41:02.052 region:rollup2
MAKE MAKE A BETTER WAY OF DOING

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:03.254 region:rollup2
IT MAINLY WHAT WE'RE DAYS WERE

02:41:02.052 --> 02:41:04.388 region:rollup2
ASKING EDUCATORS AND

02:41:03.254 --> 02:41:06.323 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:41:04.388 --> 02:41:06.757 region:rollup2
TO PHONE THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:41:06.323 --> 02:41:08.893 region:rollup2
THEY FACE AND TAKE

02:41:06.757 --> 02:41:09.927 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY. FOR IMPLEMENTING

02:41:08.893 --> 02:41:11.495 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO IT BASED ON THE

02:41:09.927 --> 02:41:12.930 region:rollup2
DATA THAT THEY'RE SAYING ON

02:41:11.495 --> 02:41:14.932 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE MEASURES OF STUDENT

02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:15.599 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE. INERT STATE SYSTEM

02:41:14.932 --> 02:41:17.501 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT IS GOING TO BE

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:19.470 region:rollup2
OFFERED IN A COORDINATED MANNER

02:41:17.501 --> 02:41:19.937 region:rollup2
WHERE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE

02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:21.372 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON DISTRICTS.

02:41:19.937 --> 02:41:22.673 region:rollup2
TO NAVIGATE AND FIND WHAT WORKS

02:41:21.372 --> 02:41:24.341 region:rollup2
FOR THEM THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY

02:41:22.673 --> 02:41:25.676 region:rollup2
ON THE STATE AGENCIES TO WORK

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:27.011 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND HELP DISTRICTS

02:41:25.676 --> 02:41:28.812 region:rollup2
CONNECT TO THE RESOURCES BUT

02:41:27.011 --> 02:41:31.081 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR

02:41:28.812 --> 02:41:32.383 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR DATA.

02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:33.751 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT MINIMIZING THE WORK

02:41:32.383 --> 02:41:35.352 region:rollup2
THAT THE HEAD IS YOU'VE HEARD

02:41:33.751 --> 02:41:36.921 region:rollup2
TODAY THERE ARE SOME PROMISING

02:41:35.352 --> 02:41:38.189 region:rollup2
SIGNS OF SUCCESS AND IT WON

02:41:36.921 --> 02:41:39.723 region:rollup2
SEVERAL PUBLIC COMMENTERS

02:41:38.189 --> 02:41:40.291 region:rollup2
REFERENCE THEIR LEARNING POLICY

02:41:39.723 --> 02:41:41.959 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE SAY WHICH I WON'T

02:41:40.291 --> 02:41:42.927 region:rollup2
BELABOR. BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT

02:41:41.959 --> 02:41:44.094 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT DISTRICTS

02:41:42.927 --> 02:41:45.896 region:rollup2
THAT RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL

02:41:44.094 --> 02:41:47.631 region:rollup2
FUNDS UNDER LC FF ARE SHOWING

02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:49.366 region:rollup2
FASTER GAINS ON SOME OF THE

02:41:47.631 --> 02:41:51.168 region:rollup2
INDICATORS ON STUDENT ASSESSMENT

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:53.270 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AROUND MATH. IN

02:41:51.168 --> 02:41:53.804 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO GATHER DATA POINTS

02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:54.838 region:rollup2
THAT IS HOMES HIGHLIGHTED

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:55.739 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

02:41:54.838 --> 02:41:57.374 region:rollup2
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:58.809 region:rollup2
POINT WHICH IS THIS ALL SOUNDS

02:41:57.374 --> 02:42:00.010 region:rollup2
NICE BUT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE I

02:41:58.809 --> 02:42:01.478 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE TALKING AT A VERY

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:02.880 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL ABOUT POLICY WITH

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:03.948 region:rollup2
THAT WE SOMETIMES LOSE TRACK OF

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:05.683 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THIS IS OCCURRING

02:42:03.948 --> 02:42:07.418 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. DISTRICTS AND

02:42:05.683 --> 02:42:08.619 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER AS

02:42:07.418 --> 02:42:09.453 region:rollup2
WE SPEAK LOOKING AT THE DATA

02:42:08.619 --> 02:42:11.555 region:rollup2
THAT THEY GOT ON THE DASHBOARD

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:12.056 region:rollup2
IT FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND AND

02:42:11.555 --> 02:42:13.190 region:rollup2
BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:42:12.056 --> 02:42:14.491 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:15.960 region:rollup2
SO THIS GIVEN EXAMPLE THE

02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:16.927 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I'M GONNA GIVE ACTUALLY

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:18.429 region:rollup2
COMES FROM ONE OF THE LEARNING

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:19.697 region:rollup2
NETWORKS THAT MISTER DANIELS

02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:21.098 region:rollup2
WILL TALK ABOUT IT AND IN A

02:42:19.697 --> 02:42:22.700 region:rollup2
MOMENT THAT THE CC  <u><c.green>IS</c></u>

02:42:21.098 --> 02:42:24.335 region:rollup2
PROVIDING. BUT THE APPROACH THAT

02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:25.269 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USING IS VERY SIMILAR TO

02:42:24.335 --> 02:42:26.837 region:rollup2
HELP COUNTIES OF WORKING WITH

02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:29.073 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED FOR

02:42:26.837 --> 02:42:30.441 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE ON THE DASHBOARD.

02:42:29.073 --> 02:42:32.142 region:rollup2
IN THIS EXAMPLE DISTRICT STAFF

02:42:30.441 --> 02:42:33.877 region:rollup2
HAD COMPLETED A REVIEW OF DATA

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:35.179 region:rollup2
AND IDENTIFIED UNDERLYING CAUSES

02:42:33.877 --> 02:42:36.780 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REALLY TROUBLING

02:42:35.179 --> 02:42:38.048 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION DATA. AND WHAT THEY

02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:40.251 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED WERE GENERATIONAL

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:41.719 region:rollup2
POVERTY FAMILY STRUCTURES IN THE

02:42:40.251 --> 02:42:42.820 region:rollup2
HOME AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS.

02:42:41.719 --> 02:42:43.887 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:45.956 region:rollup2
SESSION THE COUNTY OFFICE

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:47.224 region:rollup2
FACILITATOR ASK THEM TO LOOK AT

02:42:45.956 --> 02:42:48.525 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED IN

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:48.993 region:rollup2
REFLECT ON WHETHER THEY COULD

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:51.161 region:rollup2
CONTROL WHAT THEY HAD

02:42:48.993 --> 02:42:52.162 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:53.397 region:rollup2
THEY ENGAGE IN A DIFFERENT

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:55.165 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH ACTUALLY

02:42:53.397 --> 02:42:57.034 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE SCHOOL

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:58.602 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE POLICIES MINDSET

02:42:57.034 --> 02:43:00.404 region:rollup2
APPROACHING EXPECTATIONS OF

02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:02.306 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. AND AS A RESULT OF

02:43:00.404 --> 02:43:04.208 region:rollup2
THAT CAME TO A VERY DIFFERENT

02:43:02.306 --> 02:43:05.576 region:rollup2
SET OF UNDERLYING CAUSES THAT

02:43:04.208 --> 02:43:07.011 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY COULD DO SOMETHING

02:43:05.576 --> 02:43:08.679 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO ADDRESS.

02:43:07.011 --> 02:43:10.681 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF

02:43:08.679 --> 02:43:11.649 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THEN WHAT WOULD

02:43:10.681 --> 02:43:12.249 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IF SOMEONE SHOULD UP WITH

02:43:11.649 --> 02:43:13.851 region:rollup2
A CLIPBOARD OR PRESCRIBE SAID

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:15.285 region:rollup2
IF.

02:43:13.851 --> 02:43:17.021 region:rollup2
FIXES FROM SACRAMENTO BASED ON

02:43:15.285 --> 02:43:18.689 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WAS SHOWN.

02:43:17.021 --> 02:43:20.491 region:rollup2
SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WHICH

02:43:18.689 --> 02:43:22.726 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON MIND SET AND

02:43:20.491 --> 02:43:24.928 region:rollup2
CULTURE ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT

02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:25.863 region:rollup2
NOW ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:27.331 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM OF

02:43:25.863 --> 02:43:29.099 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IS FOCUSED ON IS

02:43:27.331 --> 02:43:30.367 region:rollup2
CHANGING THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

02:43:29.099 --> 02:43:31.301 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING OF THE CULTURE OF

02:43:30.367 --> 02:43:32.936 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO OUR

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:34.505 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND IN FOCUSED ON THEIR

02:43:32.936 --> 02:43:35.572 region:rollup2
KNEES PARTICULARLY.

IS.

02:43:58.062 --> 02:44:00.631 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

THAT DOING RELATED TO THE

02:44:00.631 --> 02:44:04.068 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT

STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:16.980 region:rollup2
ALTERNATE TO BE REPETITIVE ON

02:44:15.846 --> 02:44:18.515 region:rollup2
THIS ONE OF WHICH IS THE IT CAN

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:19.116 region:rollup2
GET ITS ITS RECOGNIZING A

02:44:18.515 --> 02:44:21.018 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP AND EXPERTISE AND

02:44:19.116 --> 02:44:23.587 region:rollup2
IT.

02:44:21.018 --> 02:44:25.289 region:rollup2
A SUPPORT THAT DIFFERENT LEVELS

02:44:23.587 --> 02:44:26.156 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE CAN PROVIDE SO I I

02:44:25.289 --> 02:44:27.358 region:rollup2
THINK ON BEHALF OF THE

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:30.561 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WERE PLEASE BE PART

02:44:27.358 --> 02:44:32.196 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND SO THE GOAL. IS THAT

02:44:30.561 --> 02:44:34.631 region:rollup2
ALL OF A LEVELS TO ASSIST

02:44:32.196 --> 02:44:36.934 region:rollup2
ELEAZAR AND THEIR SCHOOLS TO

THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH

02:44:44.708 --> 02:44:47.244 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SUPPORT UNDER LCF

02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:48.679 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:49.179 region:rollup2
EXPANDED THEIR INITIAL CROSS

02:44:48.679 --> 02:44:50.881 region:rollup2
AGENCY GROUP TO INCLUDE

02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:52.216 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES AND

02:44:50.881 --> 02:44:54.084 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS FROM THE FIELD

02:44:52.216 --> 02:44:55.352 region:rollup2
THIS LARGER TEAM IS A SYSTEM OF

02:44:54.084 --> 02:44:56.387 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PLANNING GROUP AND IS

02:44:55.352 --> 02:44:57.821 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO ADDRESS. COMMON

CONCERNS AND INTERESTS FROM THE

02:44:57.821 --> 02:45:00.657 region:rollup2
FIELD REGARDING SUPPORT FAMILIES

02:44:59.189 --> 02:45:02.092 region:rollup2
AND SCHOOLS SO SOME OF THE

02:45:00.657 --> 02:45:04.027 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF SUPPORT INCLUDE

02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:05.028 region:rollup2
INITIAL PATHWAYS TO SUPPORT AND

ASSISTANCE. AND SHOW OUT

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:08.465 region:rollup2
RETALIATES AND REVIEW OF DATA SO

02:45:07.331 --> 02:45:09.733 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IT ADDRESSING STRINGS

02:45:08.465 --> 02:45:11.001 region:rollup2
AND UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:12.403 region:rollup2
STUDENT OUTCOMES AND ALSO

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:14.705 region:rollup2

OUTCOMES.

02:45:14.972 --> 02:45:18.208 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE.

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:20.644 region:rollup2
AND SAID THAT THIS APPROACH HAS

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:21.812 region:rollup2
I AM AT AT THE THREE OF THE KEY

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:23.814 region:rollup2
CHIPS REFLECT THE INTENT THE

02:45:21.812 --> 02:45:25.282 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE.

02:45:23.814 --> 02:45:26.316 region:rollup2
ADDED TO BE TAILORED TO LOCALLY

02:45:25.282 --> 02:45:28.018 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED NEEDS RATHER THAN

02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:28.919 region:rollup2
IMPOSE ON A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:30.754 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THAT'S I THINK WHAT

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DASHBOARD

02:48:22.426 --> 02:48:25.095 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:26.997 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY. ARE INCLUDING ON THE

02:48:25.095 --> 02:48:29.566 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THE OF AN APPLE

02:48:26.997 --> 02:48:30.601 region:rollup2

THAT DEVELOPMENT AND WE

02:48:33.971 --> 02:48:37.674 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE THAT BEING AVAILABLE

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:38.909 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR WERE

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:40.210 region:rollup2
AWESOME WELL SO WOULD LOOK TO

02:48:38.909 --> 02:48:41.878 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE DASHBOARD HOMEPAGE

02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:43.347 region:rollup2
OF THE THAT GOVERNOR'S CRIME

02:48:41.878 --> 02:48:44.648 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED.

DASHBOARD INTERFACE INTO THAT

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:49.286 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP AGAIN WITH

02:48:47.417 --> 02:48:51.254 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY. UP MAKING FURTHER

02:48:49.286 --> 02:48:52.956 region:rollup2
REVISIONS TO DASH BOARD REPORT

02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:54.458 region:rollup2
SO DISPLAYING THEIR PORTS WITHIN

DO RECOGNIZE THAT MORE

02:49:07.804 --> 02:49:10.640 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ARM OUR. NEED TO BE

02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:12.843 region:rollup2
MADE AND WE DO THINK THAT.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:13.410 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:49:12.843 --> 02:49:14.911 region:rollup2

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:17.814 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THEY ALSO

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:19.282 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE USE SINCE IF WE LOOK

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:20.183 region:rollup2
AT A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE

02:49:19.282 --> 02:49:23.553 region:rollup2

ROLE AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUED

02:49:44.541 --> 02:49:47.377 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT. AND THEN

02:49:46.243 --> 02:49:49.279 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING JUST TO NOTE

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:50.580 region:rollup2

03:03:42.211 --> 03:03:44.614 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

03:03:43.079 --> 03:03:46.616 region:rollup2

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:03.392 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO.

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:04.460 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO

03:05:03.392 --> 03:05:05.861 region:rollup2
DO IT AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOU

03:05:04.460 --> 03:05:06.395 region:rollup2

03:05:05.861 --> 03:05:07.063 region:rollup2

WHICH THE RIGHT AUDIENCE WAS AND

03:05:18.207 --> 03:05:20.643 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING

THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE SHOULD BE

03:05:20.643 --> 03:05:24.613 region:rollup2

03:05:23.012 --> 03:05:25.982 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE OTHER DATA RESOURCES
