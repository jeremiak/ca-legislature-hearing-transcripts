MISTER WHITE CASKEY. I A QUESTION FOR FINANCE IT SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE FOR ME THAT THESE WERE UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS. IN THE INDICATE THAT THE COULD COST US TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO PAY THE WAGES TO THESE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GET PAID BY THEM. BUT IT'S GOING TO COST THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SET UP THE PORTAL IN ORDER TO PAY TEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE CLAIMS. I FIND IT INCREDIBLE MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU PAY FIFTEEN MILLION SEXUALLY PALE PINK WAGES THE PEOPLE DIDN'T GET OF TEN MILLION IS THERE SOME REASON FOR THAT. THAT I'M MISSING. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION- SO THE FIFTEEN POINT SIX IS A COMBINATION OF UP TO COST- THREE POINT THREE MILLION IS ACTUALLY TO DEVELOP AND- DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM AND THE REMAINING ACOSTA ACTUALLY FOR STAFF RESOURCES. THAT WOULD BE TO PROCESS THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN. IN IN CLAIMS- YES IN THE IN THE ADDITIONAL WHICH CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- SEVEN THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED IN PART ON IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY DID UP THE PILOT IN ONLINE- CLAIM FILING SYSTEM FOR ONE MONTH. ON EXPERIENCED A 47% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WAGE CLAIMS FILED. SO THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION THAT WITH AN ONLINE SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL CLAIMS FILED. WE WILL BE WORKING MISTER MISTER CHAIR I CAN I GET THAT THREE POINT THREE MILLION TO SET IT UP BUT WE'RE STILL AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING. TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT TO PAY TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WITH THE FOUR AGES THAT THESE I GET THE PEOPLE DIDN'T GET THE WAGES I WOULD BEG. THE DEPARTMENT TO.
