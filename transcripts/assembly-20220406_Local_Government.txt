SIXTEEN OH EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS HERE- TO- THIS. COMMITTEE I THANK FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH AIDS- WHICH SEEKS TO SEPARATE CORNERS OFFICE FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO RESPECTFULLY ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT. THAT TO THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED WHICH WOULD REMOVE LINE TWENTY FIVE ON PAGE THREE THAT READS TAX COLLECTOR- CORNER. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE OF THE THREE STATES THAT STILL ALLOWS- COUNTIES TO COMBINE THE OFFERS OF THE CORONER'S OFFICE WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MEMBERS WE ARE LATE AT THE PARTY. RELATE TO THE PARTY WHY IS THAT THIS QUESTION THIS IS A QUESTION- WE SHOULD AT WE SHOULD BE ASKING. FOR YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED. FAR TOO MANY TRAGEDIES. AND PATTERNS OF INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S. ARLE ARE ALLOWING- TO OVERSEE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO OVERSEE CAUSES OF DEATH RULINGS MEDICAL INVESTIGATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ANGELO CANTO. OSCAR GRANT. MAL'S HALL. DAVID SILVER LIST GOES ON AND ON. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANSWERS. WITH EMPTINESS IN THEIR HEARTS. A. B. SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. WHAT PUT CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY ADVANCED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION LIKE AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA TEN COUNTIES ARE ALREADY DOING- WHAT AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH HERE TODAY CHALDEANS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATED. LIKE LOS ANGELES. INYO SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOAQUIN MET SAN MATEO SANTA CLARA VENTURA. I AM PROUD TO SAY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY INTRODUCED A MOTION TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. BOTH OF THESE COUNTIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONS. MEMBERS CURRENT STATE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE A STATE A. SHARES TO HAVE WATCH THIS ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND OR CERTIFICATION TO ASSUME THE DUTIES OF A CORNER OFFICE NO ONE UNDERSCORE THAT. AS A RESULT IT HAS CAUSED MANY TO QUESTION WHETHER THE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS IS BALLOT WHEN THERE IS AN OFFICER INVOLVED. SHOOTING OR DEATH THAT OCCURS. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. FROM TWO BILLS FROM TWO BILLS AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX AND A. B. FOUR NINETY WHICH I WROTE. THIS GOVERNOR GAVIN IS THE SIGNED BOTH BILLS INTO LAW IN LIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY AND THE DEATH AND THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD AND ANGELO KINKO. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR ANGELO CAME TO A UNITED STATES NAVY VETERAN FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED BY POLICE MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH THE CONTRA COSTA CORONER'S OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT B. FOR THE AUTOPSY. AND RULED THE DEATH AS ACCIDENTAL AND LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH WATCH THIS EXCITED DELIRIUM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXCITED DELIRIUM. I GET EXCITED ALL THE TIME. BUT THEY CONCLUDED IT WAS EXCITED DELIRIUM THE TERM EXCITED DELIRIUM IS REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. AMERICANS OFF THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THIS TERM HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE YET IT IS STILL USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EXPLAIN CERTAIN DEATHS OCCURRING IN POLICE CUSTODY. IN FACT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE OUTSIDE THE POSITIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS RELEASED A REPORT DEEP BALL TEAM THIS TERM AND I PROVIDED COPIES FOR EACH OF YOU TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH AND WHY THEY CONCLUDE IT WHAT THEY CONCLUDED THUS FAR IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SEPARATED THE DUTIES. OF THE SHERIFFS AND THE CORONER'S OFFICE IT TOOK A VERY PUBLIC AND EMBARRASSING RESIGNATION FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER'S. AND ANOTHER MEDICAL EXAMINER ON STAFF FOR THE COUNTY TO ACT OVER THE NINE MONTH PERIOD THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER'S DOCUMENTED. COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF AUTOPSIES THEY PERFORMED. THESE DOCUMENTATIONS INCLUDES INSTANCE DENSE INSTANCES WHEN THE SHERIFF CHANGED THEIR CAUSE OF DEATH FINDINGS ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTATION IN SOME CASES THEY FELT PRESSURED BY THE SHERIFF'S TO REPORT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THESE ARE ONE OF TWO STARK EXAMPLES THAT EXPLAINS WHY WE SHOULD WE SHOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL A LIFE IS LOS WAR UNTIL ANOTHER SITUATION HAPPENS LIKE I JUST DESCRIBED. WE CAN CHANGE THIS TRAJECTORY NOW IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO QUESTION WHAT DOES NOT TRULY MAKES SENSE. MEMBERS JOINING ME TODAY- TO MY LEFT IS DOCTOR ROGER MITCHELL THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER OFFICER FROM WASHINGTON DC WHO ALSO CONCLUDED CONDUCTED SKEWS WE CONDUCTED THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AUDIT OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IN ADDITION WE WILL HAVE- JOINING ME SANDRA AKITO COLLINS THE MOTHER OF ANGELO TO BELLA. CANTO AND WHICH IS THE SISTER OF AGILE KATO AND ROBERT COLLINS THE STEPFATHER OF ANGELO KEEN TO WHO WILL- TESTIFIED. DR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY- COMMITTEE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THANK YOU FOR- ASSEMBLY GIBSON FOR YOUR INVITATION IT'S MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY. I'M DOCTOR ROGER MITCHELL JUNIOR ON THE BOARD CERTIFIED FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS AND ANATOMIC PATHOLOGIST AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN AWAIT. THAT STRIVES TO DEFINITIVELY SEPARATE THE OFFICE OF THE CORNER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SHERIFF. I'M A FORMER FBI FORENSIC SCIENTISTS. ACTICIN FORENSIC PATHOLOGY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN I WAS THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER FOR WASHINGTON DC FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AT TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE I'VE PERFORMED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND AUTOPSIES IN MY CAREER THE LATEST WAS JUST THIS PAST SATURDAY- AND I HAVE. EXPERTISE THAT EXPANDS GLOBALLY CURRENTLY I AM A TENURED PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF PATHOLOGY AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE. I SPENT MUCH OF MY CAREER DESCRIBING DEATH IN CUSTODY AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD A GROUP OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS ON A POSITION PAPER AND DEATH IN CUSTODY THE PAPER OUTLINES A SERIES OF GUIDELINES FOR THE PROPER INVESTIGATION EXAMINATION. AND REPORTING OF THESE CASES MANY OF YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THE TRANSITION OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY FROM A SHERIFF CORNER SYSTEM TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM. I WAS CALLED IN BY THAT COUNTY TO PERFORM THE AUDIT THAT LED TO ITS SEPARATION. THAT AUDIT IS NOW PUBLIC RECORD. I COME HERE TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE FOR YOU. AS YOU MAKE THIS CRITICAL DECISION TO SEPARATE THE OFFICES OF THE CORNER FROM THE SHERIFF IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS INSTILLING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN DEATH INVESTIGATION PARTICULARLY THOSE DEATHS THAT OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM EITHER DURING ARREST TRANSPORT. OR WHILE IN JAIL BUT NOT ONLY THAT. WITH PROPERLY STAFFED AND TRAINED MEDICAL LEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION SYSTEM CALIFORNIANS CAN RELY ON THE REPORTED DATA OF ALL TYPES OF DEATHS INCLUDING SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED NATURAL DEATHS DEATHS OF MOMS WHO DIED WHILE IN LABOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE DEATHS TO COLBY. AND EVEN TODAY DEATHS DUE TO MASS FATALITY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE CALLED FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE MEDICAL LEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION SYSTEM PART OF THAT REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SHERIFF CORNER SYSTEM. OUT OF THE LACK OF EXPERTISE LET ME BE CLEAR. WE SHOW SUPPORT OF OUR SHERIFFS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SEPARATING THE CORNER FUNCTION. THE CORNER SYSTEM THE UNITED STATES WAS IMPORTED HERE WITH THE ORIGINAL COLONIZATION ATTEMPTS AT IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE ITS INCEPTION. BUT IS YET TO BE COMPLETELY MATURE INTO THE SYSTEM IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE. AB ONE SIX ZERO EIGHT ö SMALL BUT NECESSARY STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT HEALTH EQUITY IN DEATH THAT WE ALL PURSUE IN LIFE. BY PROVIDING RELIABLE REPRODUCIBLE TIMELY AND ACCURATE DEATH INVESTIGATION YOU ARE GIVING CLARITY AND CLOSURE TO THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN THE MOST DEVASTATING TIME OF NEED. YOUR DECISION TODAY WILL HAVE GREATER POSITIVE IMPACT THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE. I'M TRULY PROUD OF THIS AUSPICIOUS BODY FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. SEPARATE THE SHERIFF IN THE CORNER SYSTEM THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE OTHER I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK THE WORK TO OF THE STATUS OF QUORUM RIGHT NOW WHILE WE GET THE OTHER- WITNESSES UP. GOOD POINT MISTER. SECRETARY AGUIAR-CURRY HERE AGUIAR-CURRY PRESENT LACKEY LACKEY PRESENT BLOOM HERE WILL PRESENT BOERNER HORVATH BOERNER HORVATH PRESIDENT RAMOS. RAMOS PRESIDENT THREE OF US THREE OF US PRESERVATIONISTS VOEPEL YEAH VOEPEL PRESIDENT. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR- OF THE SUPPORTERS ON THE BILL TOGETHER WE HAVE ABOUT THREE MINUTES IS THAT OKAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY PLEASE GO AHEAD TO START. GOOD MORNING WE NEED THIS CONSENT TO KEEP THE COLLINS. THIS IS PAULA THIS IS ROBERT WE ARE THE FAMILY OF FANS OF THE KINGDOM. MY SON ANGELO SKILLED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WAY ANTIOCH POLICE OFFICERS IN FRONT OF ME ON MY BEDROOM FLOOR. HE WAS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT LATE. BUT HE WAS NOT VIOLENT DID NOT HAVE ANY WEAPONS OF ANY COMMON DRUGS. SUBSTANCES OF ABUSE DESPITE THE OFFICERS ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF THIS THE PLACE TO BE ON THE STOMACH ON THE GROUND. HANDCUFFED HIM PUSHED HIS CROSSED LEGS AGAINST HIS BACK IN NEIL NEIL ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK DURING AT LEAST A FOUR AND  HALF MINUTES OF JUST RESTRAINT HE WAS COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE. YES STRING LAST AT LEAST THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES MISTER STREET IS COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE- SOON AFTER HE WAS KILLED WE EXPERIENCED BLATANT DECEIT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- WE WERE LATER TOLD BY OUR LAWYERS THAT. THIS DEATH WOULD BE BLAMED ON EXCITED DELIRIUM- WHICH WE KNOW IS WIDELY MEDICALLY DENOUNCED- AND STATISTICALLY OFTEN LIKE 90% OF THE TIME USED IN CASE OF IN CUSTODY DEATHS- AND- SO. WE SOUGHT A AN INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGIST TO CONDUCT AN OBJECTIVE AUTOPSY- AND- AT THE EIGHT MONTHS LATER AT THE AT WHAT IS CALLED THE CORONER'S INQUEST THE CORONER- UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SHERIFF DID IN FACT RULE HIS DEATH TO BE EXCITED DELIRIUM- WE WERE. THAT DAY AT THE CORONER'S INQUEST WAS EYE OPENING IT WAS- ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE WE WERE WITNESS TO A LOT OF BIAS- THEY FOR EXAMPLE DID NOT NAME US AS WITNESSES EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER WAS IN THE ROOM THE ENTIRE TIME MY BROTHER WAS BEING KILLED AND I WAS IN THE HALLWAY GOING BACK AND FORTH- THE- CONTRADICTED PUBLIC MEDICAL RECORDS- THEY HAD VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR EXCITED DELIRIUM IF WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT IT IS IF IT IS LEGITIMATE. AND- THE HEARING OFFICER. VERY BLATANTLY LED THE WITNESSES TO SAY SPECIFIC THINGS FILLED IN WHEN THEY WERE MISSING SOMETHING- AND I'LL STOP RIGHT THERE BERMAN OTHER THINGS- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU- I'M ROBERT COLLINS. YOU KNOW THEY WERE TO CRIMES COMMITTED THAT NIGHT ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH OCT TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS THE EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT WAS USED IN ANGELO WHICH IS A COMPLETE UNNECESSARY. BUT THE SECOND CRIME WAS THE CRIME OF COVERING UP A COVER UP THAT BEGAN IMMEDIATELY THE FAMILY HEARD THE NEXT- A FEW DAYS LATER CONTACTING THE ATTORNEY. THAT AN INDEPENDENT COLLEGES WAS ALMOST A NECESSITY BECAUSE- WE DON'T HAVE TRUST IN THE SYSTEM. TO BE IMPARTIAL WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AB SIXTY NO EIGHT. S. TO CHANGE THE ROLE SO THAT THE SHERIFF IS NOT OVERSEEING WHICH SHOULD BE A SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE EVEN IF THERE'S ONLY A PERCEPTION OF BIAS THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE ARE IN ITS OPERATIONS WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO TRUST THE SYSTEMS THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED WHEN THOSE INCREASE ARE SUBJECT TO- TO THE AUTHORITY OF A SHERIFF HOW IT MAY HAVE BEEN CENTS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WAY. SO IT'S REALLY A COMMONSENSE REFORM. AND IT BRINGS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND OBJECTIVITY AND BELIEVE ME OUR FAMILY HAS DEFINITELY SEEN. HOW THIS PROCESS WAS NOT OBJECTIVE TRANSPARENT- OR UNBIASED. IN OUR CASE IT WAS SO CLEAR THEY CONTRADICTED HOSPITAL RECORDS THAT CONTRADICTED EVERYTHING THEY IGNORED SO MUCH EVIDENCE- IT'S JUST SO PATENTLY CLEAR SO. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR I THINK IS A VERY COMMON SENSE REFORM AND I THINK YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO ALL BE ABLE TO RELY ON. ASSISTANCE GOVERNMENT- SO I SAID THERE WERE TWO CRIMES COMMITTED. BUT BY PASSING THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION YOU MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES LIKE OURS CAN GET CLOSURE. AND CAN MOVE BEYOND THE TRAGEDY THAT'S HAPPENED INSTEAD OF LIVING THE NIGHTMARE OF. TRYING TO- COMBAT AND CARE FIVE WHAT'S WRONG WITH GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY- I THINK YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT IMPACT ON MANY LIVES LIVES THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD AND IN THE PENTAGON JUST. NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO RATE THEIR FOUR ONE K. TO PAY FOR THE SINGS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE THANK. YOU APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- DO WE HAVE ANY- WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SHARE. A LOT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COURCELLES ELLO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- I WANTED TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM YOUR IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH THE CORONER'S OFFICE WHICH REMAINS A CHOICE THAT THE COUNTY-BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKES PURSUANT TO CURRENT STATUTE AND FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE MADE THAT CHOICE OVER THE YEARS. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN THAT MODEL TEN COUNTIES HAVE DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT THAT MODEL OR THAT THEY WANTED TO CHANGE FROM SHERIFF CORNER MODEL TO A SEPARATE CORNER INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINER THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT AND THEY'VE DONE THAT. THE CORNERS EXPERTISE IS INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S THE ROLE THEY PLAY THE CORNER DOES NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF DEATH THE PHYSICIAN DETERMINES THE MANNER OF DEATH SKEWS ME THE CAUSE OF DEATH AND THAT IS THE CASE IN EVERY DEATH INVESTIGATION WHERE THERE IS A CORNER INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MODEL IF THERE'S AN ELECTED CORNER A PHYSICIAN DETERMINES CAUSE OF DEATH IF THERE'S A SHERIFF CORNER THE PHYSICIAN DETERMINES THE CAUSE OF DEATH THE CORNER DETERMINES THE MANNER OF DEATH NATURAL ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE HOMICIDE UNDETERMINED THAT'S THE CORNERS DETERMINATION. THE CORNERS EXPERTISE IS INVESTIGATION THE CORNER DOES NOT MAKE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS THAT'S THE JOB OF THE MEDICAL DOCTOR IN EVERY DEATH INVESTIGATION THAT IS OVERSEEN BY A CORNER IN EVERY COUNTY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE GOVERNANCE MODEL THEY CHOOSE IF THEY HAVE AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINER A MEDICAL DOCTOR USUALLY A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST WITH SPECIAL TRAINING DOES THE FORENSIC AUTOPSY THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE BUT DOCTOR ALWAYS DOES THE AUTOPSY SO THIS NOTION THAT A SHERIFF DOESN'T HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING. IS ILLUSORY BECAUSE THE CORNER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL FUNCTIONS THE CORNER DETERMINES MANNER OF DEATH BASED ON INVESTIGATION OF THE FACTS SURROUNDING THE MEDICAL REASONS FOR THE PERSON'S DEATH. THAT'S IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S- IT. THERE IS THERE IS NOT A QUESTION ABOUT SHOULD A UNTRAINED. PERSON WHO IS NOT TRAINED IN MEDICINE BE MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS THAT'S THE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE APPROACH UTILIZED BY CHOICE- ENJOYS THE BENEFIT OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES SHERIFF'S OFFICES DO INVESTIGATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE CORNERS ROLE IS AGAIN THE PHYSICIAN DETERMINES CAUSE OF DEATH. IN SAN JOAQUIN THE EXAMPLE BEARS ARE TWO THINGS ONE THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEIR DECISION ON HOW THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR COUNTY OFFICES ORGANIZED AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO COMBINE THE OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF CORNER THEY HAD COMBINED THOSE OFFICES. THEY DECIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY NO LONGER WISH TO HAVE THOSE OFFICES COMBINED THEY WERE ABLE TO SEPARATE THEM AT THEIR CHOICE THEY MADE THE DECISION BASED ON ALL OF THE FACTORS OF BARK. AND DECIDED THAT IT WAS WORTH IT FOR THEIR COUNTY TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO HAVE A SEPARATE CORNERS OFFICE. SAN JOAQUIN ALSO SHOWS THAT THIS QUESTION OF MANNER OF DEATH. AND CAUSE OF DEATH. THE MANNER IS THE CORNERSTONE OF YOU EVEN IF SEPARATED FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE SO THERE ARE MANY MODELS AND ELECTED CORNER AN APPOINTED CORNER. A MEDICAL EXAMINER. AT THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT THAT THERE ARE COUNTIES WHO UTILIZES OPTIONS AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE. FROM A GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE THIS BILLS HEAVY HANDED IT DISREGARDS LOCAL CONTROL- THERE'S NO MONEY IN THIS BILL. FOR COUNTIES TO STAND UP SEPARATE SHARE OF CORNER OFFICES BUT IT REQUIRES THAT IT BE DONE- WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MASSIVE COST THIS WILL CREATE. THERE'S A QUESTION IN THE ANALYSIS WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL INTENDS TO UPEND THE CURRENT FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHO HAVE ELECTED TO USE THE SHARE OF CORE MODEL. IF IT DOESN'T THEN THAT'S- VERY HELPFUL BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THE AUTHOR BUT- THAT- THAT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR WHAT'S- WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE. COUNTIES HAVE ADOPTED PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS PERCEIVED CONFLICTS WITHOUT DEATH INVESTIGATIONS ARE UNDERTAKING- AND THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO DEATHS INVOLVING LAW ENFORCEMENT- IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A PERCEIVD PROBLEM. WITH A PERCEIVED CONFLICT BETWEEN. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INVESTIGATING DEATHS. INVOLVING LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL SAID JUST SAYS. SHARES CANNOT BE INVOLVED IN THE DEATH INVESTIGATION PROCESS IRRESPECTIVE OF ACCOUNTING SWITCHES. THE FOR THESE REASONS WERE RESPECT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CORONERS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT I WILL MIND MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- AND I JUST WANT TO- REPEAT WHAT IT ARTICULATELY HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY THE AUTHORED THAT. GAG COUNTIES CAN ALREADY DO THIS- WITHOUT A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE AND MANY HAVE ALREADY ALREADY HAVE DONE SO- SO WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU.

LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY THIS THAT- THE SIXTEEN OH EIGHT BUILT UPON THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE AROUND AB- FOR NINETY DELUDE POSITIONAL EXIA. I HAVE- CONCLUDED AND HAVEN'T WOULD NAME THIS BILL AFTER THE ANGELO AND LOOKING TO ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO TO SAY IS NAME IS AND- THAT HE IS NOT FORGOTTEN. AND WE DO THIS WORK BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ONE THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE CORONER'S OFFICE SHOULD BE SEPARATED AND WE DO THIS AND WE SPEAK THIS WAY- TWO ONE TO PROVIDE CLARITY- NOW IF HEART AND NOT THOUGHT OF MINE. TO SIMPLY SAY THAT WE WANT TO REMOVE ANY KIND OF APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY WE WILL REMOVE ANY KIND OF AND- APPEARANCE OF BIAS THIS WE BELIEVE WHEN A PATH A- A DOCTOR. WHO PERFORMING AUTOPSY HE PICKS OR FIX HER NAME ON THE DEED. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS. BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN GET AS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER- IN TERMS OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED IN ARTICULATED- THAT SHERIFF- OVERSEEING SUCH DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILL THAT THE CERTIFICATION OR THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE. TO OVERSEE SUCH. DEPARTMENT IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU SING ME OVER A CARDIO. TO I HAVE NO X. NO X. IS NOWHERE. TO EITHER AND CONCLUDE OR TO EVEN. ADD AN OPINION ON SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT EVEN SKILLFUL IN AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE WEST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW- BIFURCATING THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE CORONER'S OFFICE HAVE THE CORNER STANDS ALONE. WIND CORNERS OFFICE STANDS ALONE- THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING THE PRESSURE I INDICATED ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRED IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DURING THE DURING THE AUDIT WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL HERE TODAY WHO TESTIFIED DR MITCHELL. ABOUT HIS AUDIT HIS CONCLUSION AND AS A RESULT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEMSELVES BIFURCATING SEPARATED THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF WHAT TRANSPIRED BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS INVESTIGATED BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS CONCLUDED. DURING THAT LONG INVESTIGATION THAT PEOPLE RESIGNED AND REYES RESIGNED THEIR POSITION AND THEY KNOW COULD NO LONGER MOVE FORWARD AND SO SIMPLY SAYING INNOCENTLY BILL SIX NO EIGHT WILL PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH THE PEACE OF MIND UNDERSCORE PEACE OF MIND- WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO CAUSE A DEATH INVESTIGATION. AND THE PROCESS I HAVE BEEN DONE- BY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE THAT THEY CAN STAND BY WITHOUT ANY KIND OF INFLUENCE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE LET CALIFORNIA JOINED THE OTHER STATES. WHO HAVE ALREADY SEPARATED THE CORONER'S OFFICE FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO MOTIONS SECOND BECAUSE OF A- THANK YOU CAME TO BE ABLE TO. AGUIAR-CURRY WAIT JUST A MOMENT WHICH IS MORE ABOUT DANIEL. I'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME SOME REMARKS REAL QUICKLY- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A SENSE OF DUTY SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S ACTUALLY. DEALT WITH CORNERS AND CAUSE OF DEATH AND AUTOPSIES. I'VE BEEN PRESENT WHEN THESE TAKE PLACE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING. IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCES MORE DELICATE. THE WHEN SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE NO MATTER WHAT. AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS HIGH HIGH HIGH MOTION. AND THAT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD. WHAT TALK ABOUT BIFURCATING. THE BIFURCATION THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD. IS THE ROLE OF THE CORNER VERSUS A MEDICAL DOCTOR THERE'S A VERY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE. ONE ANNOUNCES MANNER OF DEATH. THE MEDICAL DOCTOR NOT THE CORNER THE MEDICAL DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO ISSUES THE RULING ON CAUSE OF DEATH. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION EVERYONE. THE SECOND THING I WOULD REMIND YOU. THIS IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN MAKE THIS CALL FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HAVE MADE THE DECISION THAT THEY WANT TO MERGE. THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THESE TWO ENTITIES. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN OUR BEST JUDGMENT TO BIG BROTHER. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THEIR LOCAL PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION. SO I WILL UNFORTUNATELY NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN CONTRAST- WE ARE CHAIR IS NOT HERE BUT I AM GOING TO READ YOU ADD WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SAY. AND THOSE THESE ARE HER HER REMARKS ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL.
