IN THEM OF THIS AND THE SAN DIEGO MEETING AND A SUMMARY GIPSON. AND HIS TEAM WERE VERY HELPFUL IN THE LOS ANGELES MEETING AND I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT. I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT I LEARNED A LOT I THINK WAS GREAT TO CONNECT THE NETWORK OF ADVOCATES UP AROUND AND POLICY MAKERS AROUND THE STATE. WHILE WE WERE ON OUR DOWN TIME LEGISLATIVE CYCLE AND I THINK IT PUTS ALL OF US IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION. TO ADVOCATE AND PUT AS WE ENSURING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THAT'S PART OF WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY BUT AS WE HAVE A BILL BEFORE US TODAY. IN SO IF ANYONE OUT ZERO ONE OF A ARE LIVING IN NEW MEMBERS ONE ANALYSTS SAY BESIDES THE FACT THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED UP THAT THERE ARE BALLOONS BUT I HAVE NOT.

WHAT WHAT I THINK YOU ALSO MOTHERS SO MUCH SUMMER MAIENSCHEIN HAS AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM? AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO WANNA THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF OF FOR YOUR EXCELLENT WORK WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS AS WELL. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WHAT ENACT THE ELDERS LIVING WITH DIGNITY APATHY RESPECT AND SUPPORT BOND ACT WHICH WILL PROVIDE FOR A BOND ISSUE OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND OR RENOVATION OF THE DAYCARE FACILITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA. OR RELATED MEMORY DISORDERS FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUFFERED THE CLOSURE OF DOZENS OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SERVE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF PERSONS. WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHILE CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED SENIOR POPULATION IS GROWING AT AN ASTOUNDING RATE THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN MANY CASES IN ORDER TO OPEN OUR CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THESE DAYCARE PROGRAMS. FOR THE FRAIL ELDERLY THE COST OF START UP CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION. OR EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT CONSTITUTES THE PRIMARY BARRIER TO CONTINUING OR EXPANDING THESE VALUABLE SERVICES. THIS MEASURE WILL HELP TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING SENIOR POPULATION WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE FRAIL ELDERLY. IT WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES LONGER PRESERVING THEIR DIGNITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE WHILE ALSO INVOICE MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COSTLY INSTITUTIONALIZE ATION. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED A BACKING MARQUEZ AND DON MYERS PERKY DIRECTOR OF THE YELLOW ADULT DAYCARE. CENTER. AND SUSAN. DAY. TOMORROW. MY LESSONS MAIN SHINES I GUESS A LITTLE YEAH WELL AROUND ON THESE WITH ALZHEIMER ASSOCIATION. OF COURSE NOT AGREEMENT LYDIA MASALA THIS WEB. I GOTTA MARON BANDS WITH CALIFORNIA EVERYONE INTRODUCES THE FIRST NAME I NINE IN THAT. WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES CO SPONSOR BABY FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND THEY'RE HERE FOR TECHNICAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITNESSES AND SPLIT UP GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M DAWN. MYERS PERKY FOR THE EASIEST OF ALL THE NAMES. I AM PROGRAM DIRECTORY ALL ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER IT'S IN WOODLAND. IN THIS IS MY TWENTY SECOND HERE AS THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR I'VE DEDICATED MY CAREER TO ADULT DAY SERVICES BECAUSE WHEN I DISCOVERED. THE PROGRAM AS A GERIATRIC SOCIAL WORKER THIRTY YEARS AGO I KNEW THIS COMMUNITY BASED NON INSTITUTIONAL MODEL OF CARE WOULD TRANSFORM LONG TERM CARE. AND WANT TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE MODEL YOU REALIZE THAT EVERYBODY IS THE WINNER WITH ADULT DAY PROGRAMS. INDIVIDUALS ARE WINNERS AND THEY'RE SUPPORTED WHILE STILL LIVING AT HOME THE CENTER BASED INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM WORKS WITH THE PERSON. ON AN AVERAGE OF THREE DAYS A WEEK AT THIS FREQUENCY IS THE KEY TO MANAGING THE DAY SERVICES OF THIS FRAIL POPULATION WHO GENERALLY HAVE OVER TEN CHRONIC DIAGNOSIS WITH JUST AS MANY MEDICATIONS IF NOT MORE. AND OF COURSE THE ADDED BONUS IS THAT THE PARTICIPANT IS ENGAGE SOCIALLY NOT ISOLATED WHICH HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR DEPRESSION IN THEIR STATE OF MIND. THE SECOND BIG WINNERS THE FAMILY CAREGIVERS. YOU KNOW IT FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE THE KEY PROVIDERS FOR CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES IN HEAVY HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR LOVED ONE AT HOME AND THEY TO NOW HAVE AN ACCESSIBLE SUPPORT TEAM. THAT CAN ALWAYS BE FOUND AT THE CENTER. OTHER WINNERS OF THE PAIRS WHETHER IT'S MEDI CAL THE V. A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE EMPLOYERS OR INDIVIDUALS. WOULD PAY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR IN HOME CARE ASSISTED LIVING ARE CFU NURSING HOMES PLUS THE SAME PAIR. SAVED EVEN MORE WHEN THE PATIENT HAS REDUCE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS HOSPITAL DAYS NURSING HOME STAYS DOCTORS VISITS NUMBER OF MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED. NOT TO MENTION THAT WORKING CAREGIVERS CAN GET BACK TO WORK THESE ARE ALL DOCUMENTED OUTCOMES. AND THE FOURTH WIENER ARE THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES OF DAY PROGRAMS LOVE THEIR JOBS AND STAFF TURNOVER IS VERY LOW AND THAT MEANS PROGRAMS CAN FOCUS ON PASSIONATE LEADERSHIP. QUALITY CARE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ADVANCED TRAINING CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN INNOVATION. WITH THE EVER INCREASING PRESENCE OF MANAGED CARE COUPLED WITH A STAGGERING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE ISOLATED FRAIL ELDERS FAMILIES AND DOCTORS OFFICES ARE CALLING IN REFERRING TO CENTERS AT AN INCREASING RATE. AND FINDING CENTERS ARE OPERATING AT FULL CAPACITY OR THERE ARE NONE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT ALL AND FOR THIS REASON CENTERS LIKE MINE. I HAVE HAD TO START WAITING LISTS WHICH WE STARTED FOUR YEARS AGO. TODAY WE HAVE FIFTY THREE ON THAT LIST IN THE AVERAGE WAIT IS ELEVEN MONTHS. QUITE OFTEN BY THE TIME WE CALL THE FAMILY THEIR LOVED ONE HAS BEEN PLACED IN A NURSING HOME OR IS PASSED AWAY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT THE CASE FOR THIRTY THREE PEOPLE THAT RISE TO THE TOP OF THE WAITING LIST. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT ARE CENTER BUILDING NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. WAS BUILT WITH STATE FUNDS OVER THIS DEPARTMENT AGING. OF PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS AND WE WERE THE FIRST BILL TO PURPOSE ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT WAS BUILT BY A STRONG GROUP OF COMMUNITY ADVOCATES SOME OF WHO HAVE AGED AND ACTUALLY USE OUR PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THIRTY FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A BIT WE HAVE A BUILDING THAT IS GROSSLY NINE EIGHTY A COMPACT COMPLIANCE. WHETHER ITS ARE DOORWAYS R. SPRINKLERS R. BATHROOM STALLS WERE GRANDFATHERED IN BUT NONE THE LESS WERE NOT A SAFE CENTER. IN COMPARISON TODAY'S. CONSTRUCTION WERE OPERATING AT MAX CAPACITY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TOILETS OFFICE SPACE AND WITH ALL THE WHEELCHAIRS AND WALKERS IT'S TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT. AND YET WE OPERATE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER AND ADULT DAYCARE CENTER WHERE EIGHTY CRC WERE PART OF A COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH HOME PILOT WE DO SUPPORT GROUPS AND CAREGIVER WORKSHOPS. WOOD SO WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR SPACE BECAUSE OF DEMAND BUT WE CAN'T RENOVATE OUR CURRENT SITE WITHOUT HAVING TO INVEST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND JUST FOR RETROFITTING. THEN WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR ACTUAL EXPANSION. AN ENGINEERING FIRM WE HIRED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DETERMINED THAT FINDING A NEW CENTER LOCATION THEN TEARING DOWN THE CURRENT WAS THE BEST. WAY TO GO WELL WE CAN'T EXACTLY DO THAT. YET FOR TWO YEARS NOW OUR LOCAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH LITTLE PROGRESS DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS WAS A BIG HIT WERE PLANNING. FOUNDATIONS DON'T GENERALLY WANT TO FUND BRICK AND MORTAR. ENTITIES INVOLVED ARE FEARFUL OF FINANCING CAPITAL DUE TO PRECARIOUS FEDERAL HEALTH COVERAGE HEALTH HEALTHCARE REFORMS. AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM DESPITE ALL THE GAINS FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTY IN THE PAIRS INVOLVED. IN THIS STATE EXPANSION IS NEEDED TO MEET THE DEMAND BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE CURRENT CENTERS FROM CLOSING WHEN WE BILL AND LICENSE OUR PROGRAM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FOR FIFTY NINE PEOPLE A DAY. YOU COULD FINANCIALLY BREAK EVEN BY SERVING ISSUES TWENTY FIVE A DAY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE WITH CURRENT MEDI CAL RATES SO TO BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE IN OUR COUNTY. OUT WE ESTIMATE NEEDING TO SERVE ONE HUNDRED PER DAY. IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S THERE SO WE NEED MORE SPACE TO MEET THE DEMAND AND ALSO TO AVOID CLOSURES DUE TO. ONGOING AND NEGATIVE REVENUE STREAM. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY STORY BUT IT'S REALLY OUR STORY AND WE NEED TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WE DON'T GET TO DODGE GROWING OLD NOR DO WE GET TO DODGE TAKING CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE LOVE. SO THE REALITY. WHICH TO. ALREADY KNOW IS THAT THE NEED IS ESCALATING FAST. AND IF WE DO NOTHING TO GROW THE NUMBER OF CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE WILL BE PAYING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IT THAT JUST A MUCH HIGHER COST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M A BARBARA PART BECAUSE AND THIS IS MY SISTER BECKY MY KIDS. AND THIS IS MY MOTHER. AND WE LIKE TO THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE DEVERS FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER. LENGTH DEIGNED FOR AUTHORING IS INCREDIBLY SORRY ABOUT THAT A PORTENT BILL MAHER THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT GETTING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

AS YOUR PRIMARY CAREGIVER DO IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS I CAN SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT HER MEDICAL CARE AS WELL AS THE EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS DISEASE. ON ME MY FAMILY. BUT MOST GERMANE TO A BEING FIFTEEN HUNDRED I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT MY MOTHER ATTENDED ADULT MEMORY TAKE CARE PROGRAM FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE FOR HER AND FOR ME IN THE FAMILY. IT PROVIDERS HER WITH MUCH NEEDED SOCIALIZATION IN SUPPORT.

THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE ARDUOUS JOURNEY BECAUSE MY ALZHEIMER'S. BUT I WANNA TAKE THE REST OF MY TIME TO ACTUALLY TELL YOU ABOUT MY MOTHER. AND THE INCREDIBLE LIFE SHE LEAD BEFORE HER DIAGNOSIS. SHE AND MY FATHER BUT A SMALL HOME OFFICE STORY ROAD IN EAST AND AS A IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES NOW KNOWN AS SILICON VALLEY.

ANY WHO OF IT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SO AS WE BRING ABOUT ONE TO START I THINK COUPLE YOU CAME IN AFTER WE BEGAN A ONE A REITERATE MY THANKS TO SIGN MEMBER. GLORIA AND GIPSON UP FOR EUROPE. YOU AND YOUR STAFF HELP ON THE HEARINGS WE HAD INCENDIO LOS ANGELES AS WELL AS OUR VICE CHAIRS ATTENDANCE. OF THE HEARING AND SAN DIEGO I FOUND THEM TO BE VERY PRODUCTIVE IN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR HELP SO THANK YOU. AND. THE SAME OUR THINKING WAS AND THE BILL AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING FORUMS MARQUEZ. IS HERE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THE TO YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR DAYS AFTER A PASSING ANALYSIS HAS TWO AMAZING DAUGHTERS. OTHER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR ADVOCATING I'M. IT YOU COULD BE ANYWHERE ELSE WE PART WOULD EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT BEING HERE MEANS A LOT NINE AND I THINK THAT YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE VERY PROUD THINKING. AND BUG THE SAME MEMBER A COUPLE THINGS BEFORE I PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES ONE IS. THEIR DESIRED DATE SPECIFIED BUT ABOUT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WOULD LIKELY BE TWENTY TWENTY IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE ACT. OKAY. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I I BELIEVE THAT AS OF TODAY THERE HASN'T YET BEEN A STATE AGENCY IDENTIFIED THAT SOME BUT YOU'RE ALSO WORKING ON THAT THAT'S CORRECT AS WELL. OKAY AS OF NOW JUST KIND OF TENTATIVELY WE HAVE THE STATE'S TREASURES UP SORT OFIN THERE BUT WERE STILL WORKING TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE. AGENCY THAT WILL DO THAT OKAY. I'M OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OF A BONDS OF THE STAGE I KNOW PRIOR BOND THAT WAS TO LEARN THIS NATURE PARTICULARLY REGARDS TO. THE CONSTRUCTION OF OF OR OF. BUT I UPGRADING OF FACILITIES TYPICALLY REQUIRES OR HAS WITH THAT A PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT YOU'LL BE WORKING ON INCLUDING YES WE WILL THAT WILL BE INCLUDED WHICH. EXCELLENT THANK YOU AND THEN. THE OTHER THING IS BECAUSE I AND I DID. YOU KNOW. IT IN MY. LAST YEAR IN IN MY ROLE HERE I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT FINANCIAL EMOTIONAL. MENTAL STRAIN OF CAREGIVERS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE LOVED ONES. SUFFERING WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND I'M A HUGE FAN I DON'T TAKE IT DAY CENTERS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK OUT THE ONE IN SAN JOSE IT'S IT'S PHENOMENAL AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE EXPANSION. OF THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES OB OVER THE ONE THING IN TERMS OF THIS-PARTICULAR. BILL BUT IT WOULD BE FRANKLY EVEN SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SYNERGY WITH OTHER TYPES OF SERVICE I MEAN IT REALLY JUST EXPANDING IT MAKING A LARGER. PACKAGE AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BY MORE PUBLICLY DISCUSSED YOU OFFLINE BY THE RIGHT NOW BUT JUST TO. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE YOU KNOW I'VE ONE THING I'VE LEARNED THOSE LAST TWO THERE'S SO MUCH. THERE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO LONG TERM CARE WHEN IT COMES TO CARING. FOR AFFRONT LOVELAND'S WITH WITH WHAT IT COMES AND SO THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY AND THAT ALSO COULD POTENTIALLY HELP IN TERMS OF BRINGING THE LARGER COALITION. BUT JUST WELL A VERY GENERAL THOUGHT FOR YOU THINK ABOUT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO ME MORE ABOUT IT IS TO GO FAVORITE. I'M THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND. OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE MARKETS FAMILY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOTTA BE A DIFFICULT TIME TO SHOW UP AT THE CAPITOL BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH OUR CHAIR. ON YOUR MOTHER'S HERE WITH US AND I THINK WE ALL ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THE SAME. IT IT REALLY IS A TSUNAMI ON THIS DISEASE IS A HORRIBLE DISEASE ON AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. ON. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ARE GOING THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CARE. THAT. NO UNDERSTANDS THE DISEASE AND CAN HELP THEM. IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I I HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS AND THERE ARE A MENACE SUPPORT THE BILL I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. THE CHAIR TALK ABOUT MAYBE I AM INCLUDING SOME OTHER SERVICES AND MAY BE MAKING IT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. I'M A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS. IS RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN THE MONEY WOULD GO TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER. AND IT WOULD IT WOULD BE. IT IPS. GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE SERVICES RIGHT QUITE FRANKLY THOSE ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THERE ARE NO SERVICES IN AND MANY. BUT BUT THE CHALLENGE WITH DOING A GRANT PROPOSAL WHERE IT'S A COMP COMPETITIVE GRANT. IS THAT THAT JURISDICTION HAS TO HIRE A GRANT WRITER. THE STATE HAS TO HIRE A GRANT RIVER REVIEWER AND IT'S USUALLY STAFF BUT IT COSTS MONEY. AND SO ADMINISTRATION ENDS UP TAKING A CHUNK. AND SO IT MAY MAKE SENSE FOR THIS TO BE SET UP SO THAT THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTIES. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY CAN ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS. AND. AND I PERSONALLY HATE THAT THAT THE ALLOCATION BASED ON. ON. POPULATION BECAUSE IN THE RURAL COUNTIES GET VERY LITTLE BUT THERE MAY BE THERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FORMULAS DEVELOPED THAT. THAT TAKES POPULATION INTO CONSIDERATION BUT ALSO MAYBE TAKE THAT FACT THAT SOME OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ARM HAVE NO SERVICES AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO BOOST IT SO WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS. IS RATHER THAN SETTING IT UP AS A STATE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM THAT THERE BE A WAY TO GET IT STRAIGHT TO THE LOCALS. THE TREASURES DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE THAT. KNOWLEDGE OR OR THAT THE BASE OF INFORMATION THAT THE CARE PROVIDERS HABIT IN REGARDS TO WHAT THE MARKET MOST APPROPRIATE SERVICES. AND MOST APPROPRIATE. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE WHEN YOU'RE HERE DEALING WITH SENIORS WITH MEMORY ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE ISSUES SO I'M I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT THERE MAY BE IT A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT. THAT'LL MAKE IT GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO START. BUILDING AND OFFERING THE SERVICES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. DOT THAT WAS MY. MIGHT. YOU KNOW AS I LOOKED AT HOW OPERATIONALLY YOU YOU HAD IT SET UP THE TREASURE IS GOING TO BE CONVENING AND DOING THINGS WHICH MEANS IT'LL BE A GOOD. FIVE YEARS BEFORE ANY MONEY ROLLS OUT EVEN ONCE IT'S PAST AND IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT AND SEND IT EITHER THROUGH THE COUNTY OFFICE OF AGING OR THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET IT OUT QUICKER AND. AND ACTUALLY HAVE. THOSE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE BELT OF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT DARK THEY CAN ALREADY DEPEND ON SOME MONEY GOING THERE AND NOT HAVE TO. HOPE THAT THEY GET THE GRANT. FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD SO. BECOMES SARAH GIBSON. I WANT TO SAY TO THE MARKETS FAMILY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ONE BEING HERE I THINK YOU EXHIBIT. A GREAT. COURAGE. NOTHING'S A TESTAMENT IN TERMS OF. YOUR MISSION YOUR QUEST TO. TO BE PROACTIVE IN THIS AREA. I FOR ONE MY FATHER HAD IT AND AS A RESULT PASSED AWAY. OF IT AND. CERTAINLY REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS YEAR'S AND CERTAINLY WANT TO JOIN IN AND AND IN THIS PARTICULAR MISSION. AND WE OFFER OUR SERVICES TO MEMBER MAIN SIGN IF YOU WOULD BE SO INCLINED TO OF ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR I WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO COOPER THIS BILL. AND LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU AND ALSO DON'T WE NEED DO NOT AGREE WITH MY. COLLEAGUE I THINK THE COUNTY WILL BE THE. APPROPRIATE. AREA WHICH THE RESOURCES CAN BE FOLLOWED THE RULE INSTEAD OF. STATE AGENCY GETS KINDA. BOGGED UP BLOCKER SEE IN THINGS OF THAT NATURE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE EXPEDIENT. AS WELL REALLY RELATES TO I'M RESOURCES GIVING TO. THE MOST OF NEEDS OF ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS SO. I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. UP BY SEVERAL. IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO. MAIENSCHEIN KNOWS. THAT I'M A TIGHTWAD. I DON'T VOTE FOR HARDLY ANY MONEY. ANY TIME ANYWHERE. I WILL SUPPORT THIS A TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE. I'M LOOKING AT HERE IN THE YEAR TWENTY SIXTY. SENIORS ARE PROJECTED TO PRESENT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. OR ONE IN FOUR OF CALIFORNIA POPULATION. I WILL BE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE YEARS OLD YEAH. SO I'M WAY FOR THIS. THAT. I GOTTA HAVE SOME FUN. SO. THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. WILL VOTE OR NOT VOTE FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF A BOND ISSUE. AND STRANGELY ENOUGH IS A TYPE HiA AND THE. VERY FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE. IT SEEMS THAT MOST PARENTS GET PAST. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS DON'T REALLY FIGURE THEIR PAIN FAR. SERIOUSLY. THEY FIGURE THE RICH PEOPLE ARE PAYING HIM FAR AT WHICH IS BASICALLY TRUE. SO. I WOULD GO ON. RECORD. WITH MY CHAIRMAN TO SUPPORT THIS. AND I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT MY COLLEAGUE. FROM SAN DIEGO. HAS. PUT IN. WORDING. WITHOUT REGARD TO FISCAL YEARS. THAT'S REALLY SMART. YOU'RE A SMART GUY THAT WAS GOOD. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO ANOTHER RECESSION. SO YOUR WORDING IS WITHOUT REGARD TO FISCAL YEARS SO THAT I'LL ALLOCATION GOES NO MATTER WHAT. SIR. I'M GOING. THINK YOU BASE YOUR. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. ALRIGHT IF WE CAN DO OF OAK ON THE BOAT. KALRA. I. KALRA AYE BOVELL. NOVELL AYE. CABALLERO.
