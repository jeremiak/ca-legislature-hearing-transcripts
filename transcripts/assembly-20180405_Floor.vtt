00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:02.660 region:rollup2
ON OUR BOOKS.

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:04.295 region:rollup2

THIS CULTURE HAS LED TO AN

00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:14.673 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WHERE MANY OF OUR

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:16.875 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN BULLIED.

00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:18.109 region:rollup2
SPURIOUS MENTAL DEPRESSION

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:19.511 region:rollup2

AND IN MANY CASES PEOPLE HAVE

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.384 region:rollup2
LOST THEIR LIVES I THINK THAT WE

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:27.452 region:rollup2

STUDENTS AND ADULTS HAVE GREAT

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:44.202 region:rollup2
