SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR VERY FIRST PRESENTER. DOCTOR CHARITY DEAN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA IS THE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CORONA VIRUS TESTING TASK FORCE. WELCOME DOCTOR DEAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY I'M DOCTOR CHARITY DEAN I'M THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND CO CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S TESTING TASK FORCE. AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY CO CHAIR PAUL MARKOVIC- WHO IS CEO AND PRESIDENT OF BLUE SHIELD. AND I'M GONNA GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON HOW THE TASK FORCE STARTED WHAT OUR GOALS WERE. ON THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED I'M MORE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE EXPANDING TESTING WILL TOUCH BRIEFLY ON SEROLOGY TESTING IN AND COVER NEXT STEPS. SO BY WAY OF BACKGROUND- IT WAS CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDED TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP TESTING AND THE GOVERNOR LAUNCH TO BE TESTING TASK FORCE. AS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT GOVERNMENT ALONE ON COULDN'T SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT WE NEED EVERYONE AT THE TABLE. AND SO THE TIME WE LAUNCHED WE KNEW THAT CALIFORNIA WAS DOING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THOUSAND P. C. R. S. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS PER DAY. AND WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO SCALE UP FROM THERE AND SO THE GOAL THAT WE WERE GIVEN WAS RAPIDLY SCALING UP TESTING GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE. I THINK PER DAY BY THE END OF APRIL. I WE HAD A MID APRIL GOAL OF TEN THOUSAND TEST PER DAY. AND WE WERE EVEN ABLE TO MEET THAT GOAL OF TEN THOUSAND PRESS HAS PRETTY MET APRIL AND THEN MEET THE GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TEST TODAY BY THE END OF THE MONTH. AND TODAY WERE IN THE LOW THIRTY THOUSANDS TEST PER DAY. I'M FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE STRATEGY THAT WE USE TO MEET THAT GOAL AND THAT WERE USING MOVING FORWARD. IS TO TAKE A REALLY CAREFUL LOOK AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS NUMBER ONE IS LOOKING AT. WHAT IS THE INSTALLED CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S OUR TASK FORCE ARE THROUGH LOTS OF. PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS CONDUCTED ALL. DOING CLOSE WITH THE HAAS. TO DID. WHAT IS THE INSTALLED CAPACITY OF THE HIGH THROUGHPUT MACHINES. WHO'S DOING TESTING HOW MUCH PCR TESTING CAN THEY DO PER DAY. AND THE THROUGH THE DATA THAT WE GATHERED WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT CALIFORNIA- HAS INCREDIBLE CAPACITY TO DO PCR TESTING. BUT THERE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR TEST THREE ASIANS- KITS AND CARTRIDGES THAT WERE NEEDED FOR SPECIFIC MACHINES. SO WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON WITH THE MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF THOSE MACHINES AND CARTRIDGES. TO PROBLEM SOLVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN WHERE WE CUT. AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE DISCOVERED THAT LACK OF THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIDS WAS A REAL BOTTLENECK FOR THE COUNTIES SEEKING TO TEST PEOPLE THAT MAYBE THEY HAD THE INSTALLED CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY. TO DO THE PCR TEST WITH THE MACHINES. BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION KITS AND SO IT BECAME REALLY CLEAR THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN WAS A MAJOR HURDLE IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE STILL WORKING ON WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS- TO SOLVE SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS AND WE'RE GETTING A LARGE SHIPMENT OF SAID SUPPLIES FOR SPECIMEN COLLECTION KITS AND THIS WEEK. AND WILL CONTINUE TO IN THE FUTURE OF THE TESTING TASK FORCE WAS ABLE TO PROCURE SOME OF THOSE SUPPLIES DIRECTLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO THINGS. IN FROM FEMA FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- AND THEN SOME OF THE LOCAL LABORATORIES OF COURSE OUR GOAL TO CONTINUE TO. GROW UP YOUR SUPPLY. OUR OWN THROUGH THE SMALL I'M MECHANISM. ONE THING THAT BECAME AND AS WE BEGAN TO RAMP UP TESTING CALIFORNIA WHAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA. IN GUIDANCE SIXTY IT. AND THE REASON THAT SOME IS WHEN TESTING WAS SCARE. ARE FOR AND PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ON TESTING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY GROUPS. AND IS TESTING EXPANDED WE KNEW WE HAD TO EXPAND THE GUIDANCE-AND WE DID THAT AND THAT INCLUDED A SYMPTOMATIC FRONTLINE WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WHO WORK IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SO OUR GUIDANCE HAS EXPANDED- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE TESTING CAPACITY AND NOW THE GOAL IS REALLY TO EXPAND THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES ACROSS THE STATE. AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO PAUL MARKOVIC TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. EVERYONE ON MUTE WE HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF FEEDBACK. ALL I'M SORRY. WE DO A LOT OF FEEDBACK. GO AHEAD IMPRISONMENT. I DON'T NOW IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR COMPUTER YOUR SYSTEM THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE TIED DOWN. PHONE TWO. WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. LET'S GO BACK TO DOCTOR DEAN. COME BACK TO THE- ALL. SURE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IT'S HARD OKAY SO I LET ME JUST ON TALK A LITTLE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE'RE EXPANDING THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES ACROSS THE STATE. LAST MONTH WE WERE EXCITED TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH OPTIM SIR. AND THE GOAL OF THE OPTIONS OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS TO ALLOW PRESSMAN COLLECTION SITES ACROSS THE STATE TO EXPAND. AND LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA. COOL WAS TO STRATEGICALLY PLACED SO SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES IN THE PLACES OF GREATEST NEED AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE CALL TESTING DESERT THAT'S NOT JUST A GEOGRAPHIC DEFINITION IT MIGHT BE IN A HIGHLY POPULATED OUR REGION THAT HAS TESTING CAPACITY BUT NOT ENOUGH AND- PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ABLE TO ACCESS IT. LOOKED AT THE MAP AND WE LOOKED AT A FEW INDICATORS- LOOKED AT POVERTY WE LOOKED AT ABILITY TO TASK RACE ETHNICITY HOW POPULOUS THE REGION WAS AND THEN WE LOOK AT DRIVING. AND SO ACROSS THE STATE WE WORKED WITH OUR COUNTIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. AND THE COUNTIES ARE WERE THE ONES ACTUALLY CHOOSE THE BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION OF THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES. WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE HAD- BUT THE COUNTIES ARE TRUE PARTNERS IN THIS AND ESTABLISHING ON THE LOCATION FOR THE SITE. AND OFTEN SERVED PROVIDES THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIT. AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO TESTS PER DAY SPECIMENS COLLECTED PER DAY. AT EACH SITE. SO THAT BRINGS AND TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN COLLECTION KIDS IN THE CALIFORNIA. AND THE DATA SYSTEM IS INTEGRATED WITH OUR STATE DISEASE COLLECTION SYSTEM SO THAT BOTH THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN DAY AS IT COMES IN RAIL. I'M LOS BE ABLE IT HELLO LEVEL AND- THIS IS ABOUT WHAT. AND CO. THEY TO PRIORITIZE THE SITE FOR AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SOME COUNTIES ARE PRIORITIZING FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND pLOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT THIS CERTAIN TIMES ARE BLOCKED OUT AT DOCTOR SERVICE SITE FOR THE FRONT AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS THEY'RE ALSO DOING MESSAGING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE TEACHER CLEAN PLACING THE SITE. IN LOCATIONS WHERE POPULATIONS ON THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDER CLOSURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH. AND SO IT'S A PART THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES WITH THE GOAL OF QUICKLY SCALE AT SCALING UP- OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT SPECIMENS- WE KNOW AS SUCH A HUGE EFFORT STANDS UP. TO EIGHTY TESTING RATES OUR SPRING COLLECTION SITES WITHIN TWO WEEKS- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED IN LOCATIONS. OFTEN SERVICE WORKING HARD SAYS- TWO WEEKS OR CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT WE DO THE OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT IT STANDS SAFELY AND ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT DATA IS COLLECTED. AND AT THIS POINT THERE'S A AND FOUR SITES ARE ACROSS THE STATE AND WE EXPECT OUR APPLE GO UP OVER THE REST OF THIS WEEK. AND I SO WANT TO SEE ARM IT'S BEEN PARTNERS BETWEEN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THERE CAN TO EXPAND AND GROW I COLLECTIONS THEY HAVE AS ACROSS THE STATE. THOSE ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY RENDON FRIENDLY THERE EIGHT TO BE A DRIVE THRU ASIDE AND MANY OF THOSE LOCATIONS WERE AS OPTIMIZER SOCKS ARE CURRENTLY WALK IN. LET ME JUST IN AND SEE. AN OVER. TO PAUL THE ADDED OR FOR SHOULD MOVE ON WITH. SEROLOGY THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU DOCTOR DEAN A MISTER MARKOVIC. AT OKAY OKAY PLEASE CONTINUE ONE THANK YOU I THANK YOU AND I SO WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON SEROLOGY IN UP TO THIS POINT WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS YOU SEE ARE POLYMERIZED CHAIN REACTION OR MOLECULAR TEST THAT DETECTS THE VIRUS THOSE ARE DIAGNOSTIC TAX IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE PCR THAT IS DIAGNOSTIC FROM BEING IN FACT WITH THE VIRUS THE TYPE OF TASKS IS KERALA. TO BLOW PASSED AND LOOKING FOR THE SINS OF ANTIBODIES AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC AND ON THE TESTING TASK FORCE WE HAVE A TEAM OF REALLY SMART LABORATORY SCIENTISTS OR DIE WAITING THESE NEW SEROLOGY TESTS MANY OF THEM THE PAINTING AND WELL BEING BUDGET WE'RE IN A VERY CALM ROACH AND HERE'S WHY. DON'T KNOW IF THE BODY AT THE POLICY TO. IS JUST. AFTER PROVIDE IMMUNITY TO READ. WE ALSO ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW AYE SENSITIVE OR SPECIFIC SOME OF THESE SEROLOGY TESTS ARE AND TO BREAK THAT DOWN INTO PRACTICAL TERMS THIS THROWS YOU TESTS ARE GOOD AT TESTING A WHOLE POPULATION AND TELLING US WHAT THE PREVALENCE IS. HOW MANY PEOPLE AND NOT. WE THANK OR IT DID WITH COBRA NAY. AT SOME POINT. WHAT IS NOT GOOD AT DOING IS DIAGNOSING ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WHO MIGHT HAVE IMMUNITY AND SO WE'RE REALLY TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH I WERE EXCITED THAT NEW SEROLOGY TESTS ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND ON THE TESTING TASK FORCE WE GET. INCOMING INCREASE. ABOUT NEED TESTING WE DO EVALUATE EACH ONE AND WE ARE AYE PUBLISHING GUIDANCE ON SEROLOGY THAT'LL BE ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S REALLY INTENDED FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I'M SOME COST IN WORDS OF SOME PEOPLE WONDER HOW CONCERT YOU TEST BE USED. SO HI. BUT I'LL JUST TOUCH ON NEXT AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED. I'M WE ARE EXCITED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MEET AND EXCEED THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE FOR PCR TESTING. HOWEVER WE NOW SEE THE OUR BENCH MARKET THAT WE REACH AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND TEST PER DAY. AS BEING THE NEW- THE NEW BASELINE AND WE'RE RAMPING UP EVEN MORE FROM THAT AND ARE ALL BY THE END BAY. STREET SEE OUR AN- TODAY. AND WE'RE HOPE EVEN BEYOND THAT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REACH EIGHTY THOUSAND TESTED IN THE- CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND STRONG HASN'T BEEN DONE SO FAR CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE TRACKING THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES INCLUDING THE WORLD COUNTIES- SOME OF WHOM DID NOT RECEIVE AN OPT IN SEARCH SITE. WE ARE HAVING PROBLEM SOLVED PROBLEM SOLVING MEETINGS WITH THEM EVERY DAY I TO STRATEGIZE WITH THEM TO LOOK AT THEIR CLINIC SYSTEM THEIR HOSPITALS. WHAT OPTIONS THEY HAVE AND THERE ARE MANY TO RAMP UP TESTING IN THEIR IN THEIR JOB SECTION. SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND STOP THERE AND BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK. THANK YOU. DOCTOR IN PRE BATON WE HAVE. LOST MISTER MARKER WHICH WILL GO AND HAD. OVER TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER.

GRANT AS YOU KNOW AT THE START TO OPEN UP THE STAFF HOME OR- THAT THE WE WILL SEE MORE CASES AND THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER OKAY SAYS. YES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING AND THAT WE CAN ACT BACK TO CONTACT TRACING SO THAT ANYBODY THAT I'M IS EITHER. EXPOSED AND SYMPTOMATIC OR FIRST OFF TO CONFIRM IDENTIFY THE CASES BUT THEN TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE WHAT TESTING. HAS BEEN CONTACT AND SYMPTOMATIC THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS AN ALLEY APPRECIATE THAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE VERY END BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE- GET BACK TO OUR OTHER PANELISTS THE PRIEST.

REGARDLESS OF THEIR WHERE THEY LIVE GRAPHICALLY THEIR ETHNICITY THEIR INCOME LEVEL THEIR AGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS VIRUS THERE'S NO BOUNDARY. EVERYONE GETS APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. ON THE COLLECTION SIDE WITH OPTIM SERVER A BIG PART OF THAT AND BARELY ARE A BIG PART OF THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE ENSURING THAT THAT HAPPENED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HAVE A IF THERE ARE ANY AND I DO WANT TO START BY THANKING ALL OF YOU FOR ALL OF THE WORK- AND GUIDE AND THEN AND FEEDBACK THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US ALL ABOUT DURING THIS RESPONSE. I WANT TO START BY REALLY TALKING ABOUT. WHAT IT IS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT GENERALLY YOU IN TERMS OF BROTHER OR FUNCTION- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT NOT ALL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVE PRIMARY CARE. NEXT IN ORDER TO. PROVIDE THAT GENERAL CARE TO THE PUBLIC- BUT MANY ABOUT THAT AND ALL OF US TO HAVE A SURVEILLANCE- ACTIVITIES THAT WHILE OF THESE CONTROL ACT. I'M SO TO START JUST THINKING ABOUT THE FOUR CORE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE FIRST THING IS REALLY SURVEILLANCE- MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING. WHO WHAT WHERE WHEN AND HOW OF THESE PRATT. IN ORDER TO BETTER IDENTIFY WHAT THESE CONTROL MEASURES ARE ACTIONS THAT NEED A YEAH. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE CONTROL THE SPREAD ABOUT THE- IN ORDER TO DO THAT TO. HAVE TO INFORM AND IT'S FIVE WHEN I CALLED. YOU ARE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE CARING FOR THOSE PATIENTS. AND ALSO AT SCREEN THEM AS WELL AS OUR POLICY MAKERS WHICH INCLUDE YOU ARE BORED IT PROVIDES THERE'S- ANY MARES OR LACK OF OFFICIAL. WELL THE PUBLIC AND THE- IN THAT WE ALSO NEED TO COORDINATE MANY OTHERS IN ORDER EMPLOYMENT WHATEVER IS NEEDED ABOVE IN THE FIRST THREE AND THAT DOES REQUIRE A PARTNERSHIP THAT OFTENTIMES THE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND IN CONJUNCTION HEALTHCARE ACT WELL AT SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN OUR JURISDICTION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF DISEASE CONTROL IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT IS DELINEATED I ENTITLED SEVENTEEN SECTION TWELVE SEVENTY SPEC I WOULD. DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS SERVICE BOTH APARTMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE AND UNDER THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF COMPLICATED SERVICE. RELATED TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE IN ADDITION TO THAT IT ALSO THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION AND APPROPRIATE MEASURES THAT ARE NEEDED IN MEDICARE THE HAZARD OF THAT BACK- POSES TO THE COMMUNITY. WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND TESTING MANY OF THESE ARE COMPLEMENTARY AND I HAD COORDINATION THAT NEED. AND THAT'S NOT JUST BUT AND ABOUT THE PARCHMENT BUT WITHOUT BY PARTNERS WELL. PROVIDERS AND LOCAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY RISK OFF OR UP FOR CARRYING AND GETTING ATTACKED BY THE SERVICE THAT THAT THEY NEED OR OTHER PATIENT CARE. AND FOR ME TO LEAVE WITHOUT THE REST OF THE MATCH ARE IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE A CASE AND. I'M I TO PREVENT. IT THE LABS THAT THE COMMERCIAL LAPTOP THE RESPONSE OF THE BELL AN AND GETTING APPROVAL FOR DOING pTHANK AND THEN ALSO REPORTING THAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR CARE. I THANK. IN THIS AND THEN THE INITIAL COVERED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED BY TO INTERPRET IT IF CONTROL AND THEN AFTER THEY DEVELOP BACK GOT BACK DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH I'VE BEEN SHARE THAT WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LAB IN ORDER TO THERE A TESTING BE DONE MORE LOCALLY WHICH REALLY CUT DOWN ON THE I AM A TRANSPORT ABOUT. OUR WAY YEAH ALL RIGHT. IN OUT. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WE WERE FOR ISSUING AND UP THE PROVIDER IN TERMS OF WHAT PROTOCOLS WERE NEEDED BASICALLY- GET AMPLE OF TO BE TESTED AS WELL AS WHAT POPULATIONS BASED ON THE RESTORE THE- THAT WERE OF A- YOU. PRIORITIZE PROTECT IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION. WE ALSO DID- AS I MENTIONED AUGMENT THE STATE LAB BY GETTING THE CAPABILITY TO DO COVERED NINETEEN TESTING BUT THEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LAB BUT IT IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO. THE WITH A COMMERCIAL LAB AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO MORE TESTS THANK. WE HELP IN THE WHEN AS AN IN. AMOUNT THE FOR TEST OUT THAT'S NOT NEGATIVE NOR POSITIVE I WE DO WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT F PUBLIC HEALTH THE LAB. AS WELL AS THE IF THE IN ORDER TO DISCERN ON WHAT TO DO WITH HAT. AND THEN WE RECEIVED AGAIN MOST CASES THOSE CASE REPORT AND INVESTIGATE WHETHER COMES FROM THE LAST- CARE PROVIDERS. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE FIGHT IN TERMS OF TITLE SEVENTEEN UNDER SECTION TWENTY FIVE OH ONE. AGAIN MAKING THAT THE INVESTIGATION THE TERM OF THE SOURCE OF INFECTION AND THEN TAKING APPROPRIATE THAT. PREVENT THE SPREAD. WHEN WE LOOK AT CONTACT TRACING IT IS AGAIN ONE OF OUR CORE FUNCTION. AND WE HAVE A DEDICATED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WHO ARE READILY TRYING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. ADVOCATE NUMBERS FOR US STARTED. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED. A DAY. IT DEFINITELY CREATED OUT MUCH MORE OF A DEMAND IN A NEED FOR A LARGER WORK OR- AND WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. BUT WHAT WE DID IN THE WE MADE CONTACT WITH EVERY A- AND WE WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION TO CONTACT TO GET A LITTLE MORE INTENSIVE WORK. AROUND OUR HIGHER RISK. THE STORE AREAS- THAT WERE HIGHER RISK OF SPREAD AND NEGATIVE HELP OUT- BUT THAT BE WITHIN A HOP- LOWER SKILLED NURSING FACILITY A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. OUR OTHER LOCATION- WE CONTINUE TO DO OUR- CONTACT TRACING AND INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE PROPER COLD. AND WE DO HAVE A REQUEST A FORMAL REQUEST. IN FOR A SUPPORT ON AS MANY OF YOU IN OUR CASE NUMBERS ARE WELL- IN THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PER DAY. YOU KNOWWE GET THE THOUSAND OKAY BUT THE DAY WE ARE. AT THE- AT LEAST FIVE CONTACT- K. THAT NEED TO BE- INVESTIGATED OR IDENTIFIED IN FACT IT. AND WE KNOW THAT AS THE- EIGHT OR ARE COUNTY STARTS TO RE OPEN THAT NUMBER WILL PROBABLY GO UP TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE FAVORITE MEASURES FOR US WERE PUT IN PLACE. AND AT THAT TIME FOR EACH CASE THE RIGHT EIGHT CONTACT THAT NEEDED TO BE IDENTIFIED. BASED ON AT- A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS AND AN INDIVIDUAL. WE ARE LOOKING AT AND HAVING THE STAFF THAT WORK AND- THAT INTERVIEW. BOTH AND MULTI LINK LEVEL WELL A CULTURAL LEVEL. WE OFFER IDENTIFIED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WERE TYPICALLY OUT AND ABOUT WRITING EDUCATION I TO VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIFFERENT CULTURAL ASPECT. ARE IDEAL FOR CONTACT TRACING. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT WE DO NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE. ANYWAY IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE WITHIN OUR COUNTY ALL RIGHT UP THERE ON THE QUESTION THANK YOU DOCTOR DAVIS WE APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION. AND I WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PRESENTER AND OUR FIRST PANEL WHO IS SUSAN BOSSY MADERA COUNTY IS PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR WELCOME IS BOSSY. WELL. I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR AFTERNOON. MY COMMENTS ARE PRESENTED UNDERSTANDING THAT AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE ALL PUT FORTH OUR BEST EFFORT TO STRATEGICALLY AND QUICKLY RESPOND TO THIS EVENT WITH AVAILABLE INFORMATION A RESOURCE AND I DID CONSULT WITH MANY COLLEAGUES ACROSS ROLE PLEASE. IN THE STATE TO GIVE YOU CAN'T STANDINGS WHAT'S THE STATUS AND RURAL COUNTIES OF WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES. STARTING WITH PASSED. RESOURCES FOR TESTING VERY WIDELY FOM COUNTY TO COUNTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA YOUR INTENSIVE LOCAL AND STATE EFFORTS TESTING HAS INCREASED IN MANY AREAS AND THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT TO DATE HAVE ONLY TESTED THOSE WITH SEVERE ILLNESS AND SYMPTOMATIC HEALTHCARE WORKERS SO THAT THERE IS A BROAD SPECTRUM. PRO WORK WHO TING DESERT DO NOT YET HAVE ONE OF THE TESTING SITES PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE CONTRACT AND AS DAUGHERTY INSURED THAT TESTING COSTS WORKS IS CONNECTING WITH THESE COUNTIES INCLUDING MADERA COUNTY AND WE EXPECT OUR SITE TO LAUNCH WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. THESE SITES ARE USING HIGH OUTPUT COMMERCIAL LABS THAT TAKE TWO TO THREE DAYS ON AVERAGE FOR RESULTS. AND THIS IS GREAT FOR SURVEILLANCE IT'S NOT IDEAL FOR CONTACT TRACING. SO MANY SMALL AND RURAL COUNTIES. ALSO NEED A RAPID TESTING ACCESS AND FROM OUR EXPERIENCE. INTENSIVE AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE RAPID TESTS. AS TESTING IS A PRE REQUISITE FOR MOVING FORWARD TO RE OPENING THERE ARE EQUITY ISSUES MANY OF THE COUNTY STRUGGLING TO INCREASE TESTING ARE SHORT OF OTHER RESOURCES AS WELL SUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF AND HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR SOME COUNTY LET ACTIONS TO INCREASE TESTING. ARE REALLY NOT POSSIBLE. SO WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE. MANY RURAL COUNTIES OUT WILL SOON ALSO COAST FIRE PERSONNEL COMING FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS WAS SHARED BY MANY RURAL COUNTIES WITH ME AND COUNTIES NEED TESTING RESOURCES TO PROTECT LOCAL COMMUNITY. ON THAT ISSUE THERE REALLY FEELS LIKE THERE'S A CLOCK TICKING. MOVING ON TO CONTACT TRACING OUR ENSURING THE CHALLENGES THAT- HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED WITH ME. ROLAND POOR THE POOR AS WELL AS CAN BE WITH A LARGE FAR WORK. ARE OFTEN HOUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE ONE HOME PEOPLE IN GRAY OR SHEDS AND EVEN. TO AND IN RURAL COMMUNITY IT BEEN TO FIND. THAT PROVIDE ISOLATE ROOMS FOR KOBE POSITIVE PATIENTS ARE BROUGHT TO ALL HOMELESS. AND UNDER HOW INDIVIDUALS. WE LIKE WE WILL NEED STATES. AND BE ABLE TO I ADEQUATE THROUGH HOOKED FOR SOME COUNT. WHY WE'RE EXCITED SEE THE CONTRACTORS FLAP FROM THE- DIGITAL. MANY WORLD DO NOT INTERNET SALSA AND SOME HOMES DURING HAVE A LAN LINE AT THE POINT SO CONTACT TRACER OFF A NEED TO GO HOMES ENERGY FRIDAY. I'M FOR MEN PEOPLE QUARANTINE OR ICE. COULD MEAN LOSS INCOME. SO WAIT YOU'RE- OR SIX IS VERY. I WE FOUND THAT THIS PEOPLE. MAY NOT WANT TO BE TEST BECAUSE THEY NEED TAKEN TO WORK AND DON'T WANT TO THE AND IF THEIR TASK COMES BACK POSITIVE. SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT KEY ON SHARE THEIR- AS WELL ANY MAGIC MIGHT NOT BE THE- SENT WHO WANTS TO BE THE RE WHY CALLED. CAN'T COME TO.

THE HELPFUL AS WE DO AN OUTREACH TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY MOVING INTO TIER ONE. UP FOR PRIORITY THAT THEY CAN BE TESTED. MAYBE SHOULD BE TESTED. UNDER THE THAT WE STARTED TO I THINK EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES THAT. THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR BATES WITH SOMEONE LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT FROM THE PANEL. IF PASSED THE IN DEMAND ISSUES. OKAY DOCTOR DEAN GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA START I'M GONNA HAND OVER TEMPLE MARKOVIC SO THERE'S THE POWER POINT FOR OUR PRESENTATION WILL WORK BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING HERE BUT WAS PROVIDED DOES THIS SLIDE THAT LOOKS AT THE BIG FAN THE MACHINES HI THROUGH THAT ARE IN STOCK ACROSS. THE STATE. OKAY S. BUT LOOKING AT THOSE MACHINES THAT'S WHEN WE WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE THE CAPACITY IT'S LOOKING AT ALL THE MACHINES ACROSS THE STATE AT THAT HIGH THROUGHPUT AND WE KNOW THAT ADEQUATE PASSED IN THOSE CHAINS ON TURN OVER AT. ALL THANK I APPRECIATE THAT SO THAT THE CAPACITY ON THE DEMAND QUESTION THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN ONE IS- PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET REFERRED FOR A TASK AND NAKED TESTING GUIDELINES AFTER DEAN WAS TALKING ABOUT. A YOU KNOW THE PRIORITY ONE THIRTY TWO- ETCETERA. AT THIS POINT IS A KNOT TESTING CAPACITY THAT THERE'S BEEN GUIDANCE TO EXPAND TESTING IN PARTICULAR THE FOCUS ON THE NEXT PRIORITY WHICH IS- LARGELY ABOUT. AND WORKERS HOSPITAL THEN MATH- AND OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO I THINK IT'S HELP THESE ARE SPECIFIC LOCALITIES ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND TESTING IN REFERRAL. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK IT'S TRYING TO EXPAND TESTING AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ACCESS. TO BEEN REFERRED TO A TASK. I'LL BE ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE AND HAVE A SPECIMEN TAKEN A NAP BUT WE'RE HOPING THIS NETWORK OF COLLECTION SITE THAN OTHER METHODS. FIVE THAT WE ARE. TO THOSE FOLKS. I AMPLE MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN COLLECT THE SPECIMENS. AND SEND TO THE LABS WHICH ARE RIGHT NOW TELLING US CONSISTENTLY. PLENTY OF CAPACITY THEY JUST NEED MORE STAFF LIMóN SO. THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON TRYING TO EXPAND. REFERRED FOR CAT AND A PATH TO THE TO BE ABLE TO BE ON. ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT A SPECIMEN FROM THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I JUST WANTED TO- AND I AM I ON STILL YET RUN IT LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS THAT CONFUSION YEAH COMMUNITY BELOW ARE. SOME ARE ODD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE GETTING. ICE YOU'RE NOT MEETING OR THOUSAND. OR WHATEVER THAT. THE IN A SIGN OR THE FIGURE OUT CAPITA THAT WHAT THERE'S TO BE SO I SOME GUIDANCE FROM ALL OF YOU TO HAVE US THE LOCAL LEVEL I HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT IN THAT WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. TO ACCEPT AND WANT TO BE TO WHEN TO THE ARE OUT BROAD CAN. RIGHT NOW I HAD THIS. WITH OUR MINISTRATION JUST THE OTHER DAY THEY SAID THERE IS REALLY AYE A MISCOMMUNICATION OUR CAPACITY VERSUS DEMANDING GETTING TO THE DEMAND SIDE YOU ALL NEED US. GLAD TO READ THAT WERE IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT WILL BE SOLD. AS CALLING. OUR ISSUE. THANK YOU ARE NOW ONE OTHER QUESTION WHEN WE EXPAND. THE OUR CAPACITY TO GOOGLE AND- THE OTHER ONE. NUMBER THE AMAZON AND GOOGLE I BELIEVE ARE THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY ON OUT IN ARE WE LOOKING OUT OF THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS PRIVACY HELLO SIGN MAJOR PLATFORMS ARE INVOLVED. YES THANK YOU SENATOR BATES DO WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT FROM OUR PANELISTS ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES AND I THINK MS FINELLI IS RAISING HER HAND CIVIL. UNDETERRED BOOKING USING SOME OF THE APPS IS MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT- A LOT APPS OUT THERE pHOW CLOSE SOMEONE IS YOUR PHONE HOW ALL OF THESE KIND OF WAYS OF JUST. KEATING THAT SOMEBODY IS IN THE- PERIMETER OF ANOTHER PERSON BUT THE APPS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT USING. REALLY ARE JUST DATA MANAGEMENT AND TOOLS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. AND CLEARLY THE PRIVACY WILL BE LEFT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CONTACT RACERS WHO ONLY BE LOOKING AT THOSE CASES I'M DOING MORE OF THE TRADITIONAL REACH OUT- AND CLEARLY PROTECTING THE- PRIVACY WILL BE. IN ALL OF OUR INTERESTS WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THAT SORT. APPS THAT ARE MEASURING HOW PEOPLE ARE MOVING IN AND THOSE KINDS OFTHINGS AT LEAST NOT IN THIS INITIAL PHASE. THANK YOU. I'M CULTURE DID YOU AVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR US. NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT ARE WE WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK GOD YOU ARE NOT TO JEAN AND- OFFICERS ON. ORDERING AMAZING WORK I WAS HEARING THIS I'M PRESIDENT AND DAMMIT THANK YOU. I HAVE A IT'S JUST A FEW QUESTIONS I THINK COLLEAGUES DOCTOR GENE BUT- HEALTH OFFICE MAY START TO. THE FIRST IS ARE WE KNOW THAT ON CONGREGATE SETTINGS INCLUDING PRESENTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AROUND SPREAD OF THE CONTAGION ARMY IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE NURSING HOMES ALMOST LL STARTUP. ARE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD A CALL THIS MORNING WITH SECRETARY DO YOU GUYS AREN'T THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF FOCUS WORK TRUSTS ARE PROBLEMS OUR PRISON SYSTEM. I ARE. A FROM REDUCING POPULATIONS WE ON THE NATURAL ARE CONTINUALLY FIRST RELEASING PEOPLE- FROM PRESENT AS THEIR TERMS EXPIRE GOING ROLE FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. RELEASING PEOPLE WHO ARE. POSITIVE THE GENERAL POPULATION WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TEST OUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED SIR IF YOU DAYS BEFORE- ARE THERE RELEASED SO WE KNOW IF THEY NEED TO BE. ORANGE UNIVERSAL BEING USED TO BE THOUGHT. TOM ON WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THERE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER. SO RELATED TO NURSING HOMES AND OF COURSE OUR- FACILITIES- PRISON FACILITIES SO ANY ANSWERS ON THAT- FROM THE PANEL AND I HAVE MISSPENT FINITELY. I CAN JUST START BY FIRST OF ALL FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SO WE ARE WORKING EVERY DAY WHAT ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HELLO I'M CALLING THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY AND INNER- SURVEY I'M TO SEE WHAT THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARE WE ARE PROVIDING IN FACT PREVENTION. TRAINING AS WELL ON SITE INFECTION FROM LAST YOU. YOU INFECTION ONCE WE'VE I'M ISOLATED THE CASE OR MULTIPLE CASES IN A FACILITY WE ARE SENDING OUT STRIKE TEAMS TO HELP WITH I'M IMMEDIATE STAFFING NEEDS WORK OR SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE. IN WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BURKE CASES THEY ARE ALSO IMPACTING THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS BUT NOT ONLY HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO ARE SICK BUT SOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE SCARED TO COME TO WORK AND- I'M SHOVEL. THAT WE HAVE AND TAKING ON A NUMBER OF ACT IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN THEY GAVE. YOU MAY WANT TO PLANT ON THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IN ALLENTOWN BECAUSE- OF NUMBER OF THEIR SKILLS. FACILITIES ALSO HAVE OUTBREAKS AND WE'VE BEEN. PARTNERING WITH THEM- AS WELL AS OUR LICENSING FUNCTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHERE SOME OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY ARE PART OF. A BIGGER. ROCK PALM MORE SOME OF THE BAKER. OPERATORS ACROSS THE STATE THAT THEY ARE INDEED IN THEIR OWN WORK FORCE AND MOVING THEM AROUND INCLUDE ACTION PREVENTION ASSUMING. JUST LOST WHERE THEY MIGHT BE TO MOVE THE AROUND BUT IT'S A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IT SET UP TO BE CONGREGATE AT HOME AND SO ONCE AN INFECTION IS IN LINE I'M A SAYS IT IS HARD. BY THE TIME YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN CONTROL IT AND- YEAH OFTENTIMES BY THE TIME YOU GET ONE CASE YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES WITH. THE QUICKLY ON THE WORK WE ARE DOING THE STATE PRISONS. WE ARE ARE WE HAVE AN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND OUR SCIENCES BRANCH WITHIN OUR INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROGRAM. AND ARE I'M HEALTHCARE ACQUIRED INFECTION. PARTNERED UP WITH THE I. AND CDC ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE GOOD PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE INMATES TO ISOLATE. AND QUARANTINE NOT NOT NECESSARY BUT ALL TO WORK ON. A STAFFING SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROCEDURES IN PLACE AS WELL. AND AS FAR AS AND- I'M PROBABLY A LETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PRISONS TRYING TO DO A WARM HAND OFF SOMETHING THAT. IF SOME IS. IT QUARANTINE OR THEY'VE BEEN I'M WITH THEN THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH CARE IS AS NOTRE THAT'S NOT WORKING PERFECTLY AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT SO THAT WE GET A ONE HAND SO THAT THEY AREN'T LOSS TO **** ON TAX WHEN THEY GO OUT BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY BUT NOT MADE THAT QUESTIONS ARE THESE AREN'T PEOPLE BEING SINCE WE TEST. IF YOU DAYS BEFORE. YES SIR WE KNOW WHEN IS HAVE YOU KNOW SOUND OFF. THIS PERSON JUST TOUCHED UPON FOR THIS PERSON JUST TESTED NEGATIVE. I THINK THAT IS THE CDC OUR QUESTION LARGELY I KNOW THAT THEY ARE TESTING SOME PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT. THEY CAN'T MANDATE TESTING AND SO SOME OF THE NOT WANT TO BE TESTED I'M ALSO TING PROTOCOLS THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE AS JAY WHO GETS TESTED THEN WHY IN TERMS OF- IF THEY WORK SCOTT BACK TO OUR- I'M QUE BUT THERE I DO. BELIEVE THERE AVERAGE FOR THE A LOT. I LOOK NOT REALLY SHE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ON MY CHAIR RIGHT NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE COLLECTION OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA SO THAT WE KNOW. WHO WHICH COMMUNITIES MIGHT BE DISPROPORTIONATELY ARE BY PROVING NINETEEN WE KNOW BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATIC DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION. AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS BEING VERY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PARTICULARLY AROUND HOSPITALIZATIONS I SEE YOU ARE AND DUST IT'S REALLY JUST- JUST HORRIBLY TRIES NOT ACCEPTABLE ARE WE KNOW THAT THE LET'S YOU KNOW COMMUNITY AS WELL WE DID SOME RESEARCH INTENSIVE TESTING IN THE NATION. AND 95% OF THE POSITIVE WHERE IS FEWER THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE TESTED RELY NOT. THIS PERSON I'M BUT I'M NOT DATA IS EXTREMELY USEFUL BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW WHERE TO FOCUS RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING INEQUITIES I'M GLAD WE'RE GETTING NOT VERY DISTURBING DATA. SYNC WITH EACH. ONE AS FAR S I CAN TELL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ART THESE ARE COLLECTING ALL ESSENTIALLY NO DATA ON THE IMPACT. THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THIS IS. WITH THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT COLLECTING DATA RELATING THE LGBTQ PEOPLE ALWAYS MAKES OUR COMMUNITY AND BEST OF ALL ARE WE KNOW THAT OF THE TEACHERS YOUR CALL HAVE INCREASED HEALTH RISK FACTORS.

I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE LARGER ISSUE OF OUR DATA THAT'S BEING COLLECTED IN OTHER PLACES- OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAD AROUND COLLECTION OF DATA FOR THOSE THAT WERE STANDING UP.

ON MENTAL HEALTH AND A- ARE DURING THIS. AND DAM ACT ARE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALREADY. IN NINETEEN MAJOR CHALLENGES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION IN OUR STATE ARE WE SEE IT ON OUR STREETS ARE ALMOST POPULATION BUT IT WELL BEYOND HOMELESSNESS AND LACK OF ACCESS TO TREAT MEDICARE. AND THE DATA THAT I'VE BEEN SEEING ABOUT OUR COULD BE NINETEEN AMOUNTS ALTHOUGH DICTION I VERY VERY TROUBLING.

THANK YOU SENATE RATE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT. MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION QUESTION. WE CAN ALSO RECEIVE- COMMENTS FROM OUR COUNTIES IF THERE ARE ANY THAT I KNOW LA COUNTY JUST PERSONALLY DOES A LOT OF GREAT WORK IN THAT SPACE- EITHER MADERA COUNTY WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM EACH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES AS WELL. TO RAISE YOUR HANDS ALL AT ONCE DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO. THINK. DO WE HAVE SOMEBODY ON THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE TO. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES DOCTOR DAVIS THERE YOU GO. OKAY THANKS TO RAISE MY HAND I WAS JUST WAITING PATIENTLY UP SORRY ABOUT THAT- NO NO PROBLEM AT ALL YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE- THAT YOU KNOW. THE NUMBER OF REPORTS BASED ON THE FACT ABOUT IF YOU HAVE GONE UP- WE OFF OF THE FACT THAT. THAT WILL START TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE PATIENT BACK THROUGH THEIR PROVIDERS OR GO BACK PREVENTIVE CARE WE MAY BE MORE IN RELATIONSHIP. YOUR BETTER UP. AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE. DATA IN RELATIONSHIPS THAT. I HAVE MANY. PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN AT HOME FOR THE MOST PART. ABOUT WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE FROM UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE COME FROM THAT. WE WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR DAVIS A APPRECIATE THAT AND ANY OTHER ANSWERS. FROM THE PANELISTS. MS BOSSY. THANK YOU WE HAVE BEEN- PARTNERING LOCALLY WITH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT I TO REALLY- INCREASE- SURVEILLANCE WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE KNOWN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR SURE. ALL WE'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH- MINISTERIAL ASSOCIATION AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I TO MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE SAFE WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN. BE ACCESSIBLE FOR- COUNSELING AND PROVIDING SUPPORT AND HELP. IT OUT WE DO EXPECT AS DOCTOR DAVIS- SAID THAT- MIGHT MANYOF THESE ISSUES ARE STILL HIDDEN AT HOME. AND ESPECIALLY AS WE OPEN SCHOOLS BACK UP AND THERE IS MORE INNER INTERACTION WITH MANDATED REPORTERS WERE EXPECTING INCIDENTS OF- CHILD ABUSE CASES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OTHER SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES- TO GO BACK UP TO LEVELS AS THEY WERE AND PROBABLY HIGHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND NEXT WE WILL HAVE SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. MY OWN. YOU'RE ON THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE- THE TESTING IN THE TRACING ISSUE- AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE PRIVACY ASPECTS- I'D LIKE A RIVER I'D LIKE YOUR RESPONSES- FROM THE PANELISTS ON THE PHONE AT THE SWIMMING IN MY- ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCURATE- WE ARE NOW MOVING INTO PHASE TWO THE GOVERNOR IS INDICATED THAT HE FEELS THAT WE'VE MET ENOUGH OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIS SIX CRITERIA THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. SO AS I LOOK AT THAT MICHAEL AND I ASK MYSELF AND I ALREADY LIKE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS I'M NOT OF THE WE HAVE HAD ADEQUATE TESTING. OR TRAINING FIX THAT NOW I KNOW I'VE WORKING RIGHT IN DR DEAN THANK YOU FOR GREAT EFFORTS IN ALONG WITH YOUR SILENT ALMOST. PARTNERS THE- WITH BLUE SHIELD. SO WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH IN WHO WE BEEN TESTING WE PRIORITIZE TWO ONE WAR A HIGH RISK PEOPLE WE'VE EXPANDED THAT NOW TO INCLUDE A SYMPTOMATIC FRONTLINE WORKERS- THERE AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET TESTED TO THE EXTENT THEY CAN GET A DOCTOR'S PERMISSION TO DO SO BUT WE DO KNOW THAT ABOUT 80% OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED BY OR AND CAN TAKE THIS WILL. THIS VIRUS I'M SHOW NO SYMPTOMS SO THEY ARE ASYMPTOMATIC- AS WE TRY TO I ASSUME CONTAIN THIS. OF VIRUS AND I ASSUME THAT'S THE REASON FOR TESTING IN TRACING AND I'D- LOVE TO HEAR WHETHER OR NOT I'VE GOT THAT ASSUMPTION CORRECT. BUT HOW IS IT THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF TESTS THAT WE ARE DOING OR THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO AND THE DELAY IN. GETTING THOSE RESULTS. WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE MOVING TOWARD CONTAINMENT WHEN WE ALREADY IN TESTING I'M IS LIKELY NOT TO EVEN SHOW SYMPTOMS. SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO THAT CONCERN I THAT WE- UNLESS YOU CAN TELL US RIGHT THE ONLY AND I HAVEN'T ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT THAT OR- WHETHER THESE NUMBERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY WHAT WAS IT SIXTY THOUSAND THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO- HOW IS THAT GOING TO. OUR LESS TO THE POINT OF CONTAINMENT MOVE US TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE- CAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE CAN FEEL SAFE FOR A LOOSENING UP THE RULES GOING OUT IN PUBLIC MORE. RATHER THAN THE STATE HOME REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE NOW AND THAT IS ABOUT TO END. YES THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S YEP DR DEAN. QUESTION ALL ALL START IN AND TURN IT OVER TO MISTER MARKOVIC IF HE WANTS TO ADD ON TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TESTING YOU KNOW WE HAVE HIT THAT THIRTY THOUSAND TEST TODAY BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. I'M WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE UP INTO THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND TEST DAY TO HIT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE TESTED ON WHEN WE EXPAND AND THAT OUR STATE GUIDANCE LAST WEEK IF YOU LOOK AT IT YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN THE REASON WE SAY IT'S FURTHER EXPANDED. IS IN PRIORITY ONE IT'S A VERY LARGE BUCKET IN INCLUDES YOU KNOW SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE IN IN A HOST OF DIFFERENT ESSENTIAL OCCUPATION- AND IF YOU DO THE MATH ON THAT IT'S A REALLY LARGE NUMBER OF. CALLS A YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE I AM IN TESTING ON THAT FOR CON BEST TO GATE. OTHER WORDS IN ORDER TO THE BREAD AND BUTTER PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY OF CONTAINMENT IS TO CREATE A REALLY AREN'T ACCURATE CONTACT INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU CAN TRACK AND TRACE AND IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO IS EXPOSED AND TEST THEM AND PARTICULARLY TO THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE WITH THIS AFTER JANET CAN- HAVE THOSE ARE INFECTIOUS A SYMPTOMATIC TRACKING IN TRACING TESTING THOSE THAT MEET INFECTIOUS BASIN TO NOT A REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING ON THE TURN AROUND TIME TESTS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL TESTING MODALITIES- LET RAPID WHEN SAYING OF THE VIRUS- WE ARE NOT TO DEPLOY NOW TWICE. IN FORTY WE HIS THAT IS THAT GOING TO ABILITY IT'S HELP A SCALE ACOSTA I'M AND I THE RIGHT TURNAROUND THAT WE SO THERE'S MORE WERE TO BE DONE WE KNOW MADE SOME PROGRESS BUT WE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO BE FASTER AND WE NEED TO BE DEPLOYED. A QUICK FOR THOSE CONTACT INVESTIGATION. MISTER MARK ANY OUT ON THOSE. THANK YOU YES I SAY YOU KNOW I WERE. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE NEARLY FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND TO HAVE THEM ALL AT ONE WORST QUOTE IN A VERY CLOSE PERIOD OF TIME WITH A MEDIATOR NEAR IMMEDIATE RESULTS AND UNDERSTAND EXACTLY. WHERE THE VIRUS DID AT THAT POINT THAT WOULD BE IDEAL IT'S ALSO NOT FEASIBLE WITH THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND CAPACITY AND SUPPLIES- AND SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF FINDING A DRAMATIC CARRIERS. WITH THE IN PLACE ORDERS GOING ON FOR WEEKS BUT THE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AMOUNT WAS- AT A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ONE OF WHICH IS REGULARLY CASTING PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE EXPOSURE. LIKE FRONTLINE HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AND OR OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND KEEPING CLOSE TABS ON THEM AND THEN FINING PEOPLE WHO IF THEY HAPPEN TAX SHELTER IN PLACE. AND THERE'S TYPICALLY ABOUT A FOURTEEN DAY INCUBATION PERIOD FOR THE VIRUS BEFORE YOU START EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS. THEN IF YOU ACTUALLY DONE THAT EVIDENCE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHELTER IN PLACE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MOVING THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU LOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. INTO MATIC LATER BECAUSE RESERVE LAID THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF SHELTERING PLACE. BY THEIR ALREADY PROCESSED THROUGH. EXPERIENCING A VIRUS OR NEVER HAD IT AND SO- THAT THE THINKING BEHIND WHY THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TESTING IN THE APPROACH- THAT WOULD BE TAKEN AGAIN IN THE IDEAL WORLD WE COULD BE DOING THAT'S WAY MORE BROADLY- AND WE CAN CERTAINLY POTENTIALLY EXPAND BEYOND FIFTY THOUSAND OR TRY TO. IMPROVE THE TURN AROUND TIME. I CAN'T GET EVERY NEW MIGHT BE. BACK BUT YOU HAVE TO TEST INTO POCKET IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. GREAT THANK AND SENATOR JACKSON DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION YOU'RE ON MUTE. YES I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO- I'D LIKE TO ASK A FOLLOW UP AND THEN A QUESTION ON THE PRIVACY ISSUE. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT THE TURNOUT ISN'T THAT FAST THAT WE STILL AREN'T ABLE TO TEST. THE SIXTY OR SEVENTY THOUSAND WOULD YOU BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- AND ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT QUESTIONS WHY THAT NUMBER WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU- GIVEN THAT THE FACT THAT THE- THING ISN'T ADEQUATE. YET DAD THE TURN TIME IS SO LOW WHY WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE ARE. IN A POSITION TO MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PHASE IF WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE. ATTESTING TO MEET THOSE- PRELIMINARY OR BASED A QUESTION AS TO WHO. I IS INFECTED AND WHO IS POTENTIALLY TRANSMIT THE DISEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. ARE WE GONNA SEND THAT BACK TO. DOCTOR DEAN OR WHO WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION PLEASE. ALL RIGHT THERE SHE'S. I'M HAPPY TO START AND THEN IF MY COLLEGE STUDENT DALY WANTS TO JUMP IN ABOUT THAT TRACK AND TRACE EFFORTS- PLEASE DO- SO LET ME START WITH THE OFFICE YOU QUESTION OF HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THAT NUMBER WE WRITE THAT NUMBER A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS. AND EVERYONE'S DOING MATH TRYING TO CALCULATE WHAT THE NUMBER METRICUS. AND WE IS THE STATE HAVE NOT GIVEN OUT A RECOMMENDATION TO COUNTIES OF WHAT THEIR- ON. METRIC IS ON A WHOLE BUT THAT. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE NUMBER OF COHORTS OF PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO BE TESTED SO MISTER MARK OF IT SHOULD WORK FOR YOU. ON YOU KNOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS FRONTLINE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON SAFETY OFFICERS AT CENTER AND SO FEW OUT OF THOSE GROUPS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY. WITH WHICH THEY WOULD NEED TO BE TESTED AND THEN YOU DIVIDE OVER TIME. YOU COME TO AROUND THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DIAGNOSTIC ON PCR TEST DAY. THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING IS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. ON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION WAS DONE BY WERE THAT DID YOU ASK FOR. THOUSAND PER DAY JUST ONE THERE ARE STILL OTHERS. SO THAT'S HOW ARRIVED AT THE NUMBER. I WILL ALSO SHARE THAT. TESTING IS JUST ONE PART OF THE STRATEGY THAT CONTINUING TO PHYSICAL DISTANCE AND IMPLEMENT SOCIAL DISTANCING- WHERE POSSIBLE AND FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS REGARDING. MASS GATHERINGS OR RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE SEQUENTIAL RESPONSIBLE AND- I. LIFTING FIVE SOME OF THOSE. MEASURE IS A RISK THE WAY TO APPROACH THIS BECAUSE TESTING IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING. YOU NEED TO PRACTICE THE GOOD HYGIENE IN THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING- IT IS IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND WE KNOW THE AS INCREASE SEROLOGY TESTING IS BEING DONE AND FORMS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN A IN FACT IT. ON THAT HELPS TO FORM WHAT WE DO BUT AND SO WE HAVE BETTER SEROLOGY TESTING THAT ARE RELIABLE AND A DIAGNOSTIC LEVEL AND ON A- BASIS IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED CONTINUE TO BE VERY SLOW AND VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT LIFTING ANY OF THOSE- ANY THE STATURE AND THE MEASURES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE TO. BY THE AT EIGHT THAT WE FEEL THERE'S ADEQUATE DIAGNOSTIC PCR TESTING TO SUPPORT ON THE COUNTIES TRACK AND TRACE EFFORTS. THANK YOU DOCTOR DEAN AND JUST DO A QUICK TIME CHECK WITH ABOUT FIVE MORE SENATORS AFTER SENATOR JACKSON'S SO JUST WANTED TO- INSURE EVERYBODY KNEW SO SENATOR JACKSON AND YET ONE MORE QUESTION I DO AND THIS IS THIS IS A QUESTION ON PRIVACY THAT WAS RAISED- PREVIOUSLY BY SENATOR BATES- AS WE- HAVE ADVANCED AND WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY IS HOPEFULLY IS A- PARTNER. IN THIS. THERE IS CERNAN I HAVE ADDRESSED SEND TO THE GOVERNOR SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFYING A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH USING TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE TACING WHICH MAY BE VERY HELPFUL AND MAY BE CRITICAL. I HAVE YET TO HEAR THOUGH ANYTHING OTHER THAN VERY GENERALIZED STATEMENTS. OF ARE HOW WE ONLY ARE USING THE INFORMATION TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE COPING PROBLEM. BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT THE- COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THE TECHNOLOGY- NEED TO BE ARMED AS- REQUIRED. TO ASSURE US AND TO ENTER INTO WHATEVER CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS IF WE DECIDE TO HAVE WITHIN. THE DATA. IS NOT USED BY THEM OR MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY OTHER THIRD PARTIES. IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN FEEL CONFIDENT AND ASSURED THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE IS GOING TO EACH- IT WAS TO CREATE A PROFILE. I USED TO AGGREGATE SOMEONE'S A PERSONAL IN FOR WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO THAT SUCCESS LEVEL SO I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU ARE DOING. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOOGLES THE OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE STEPPED FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL ARE NOT GOING TO THEN. USE THAT INFORMATION IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM- BEYOND THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF HELPING US TRYING TO IDENTIFY THOSE MAY BE CLOSE TO COPE WITH SO WE CAN AYE BLADES WARRANTY MORE. IT IS YOU CAN. THANK YOU SENATOR JACK AND I KNOW- MISS FINALE HAD THE LAST QUESTION THAT BOTH SENATOR JACKSON AND- SENATOR. BATES HAD MENTIONED SO DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TRY HIM BACK IN HERE MISTER NELLY. TOUR SO I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE CONTRACTS THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO YOU FOR THE DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND THE SOFTWARE PIECE ARE. FULLY PROTECTED WITH PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS AND SO THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE SAYS AND- THEN INFORMATION MORE COLLECTING IS SIMPLY THE CONTACT TRACING INFORMATION THAT IS NOT. GOOGLE AND APPLE APPS THAT ARE COLLECTING INFORMATION PEOPLE'S PHONES IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF ACT THAT WE ARE WE ARE INVESTING AND- OKAY THANK YOU DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP STRUCK A SENATOR JACKSON. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO AT SOME POINT BE ABLE TO. SEE THOSE CONTRACTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT APPLE PHONES RETIREMENT INFORMATION. REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT COMES FROM AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. THAT HIT BUT IS NOT APPLICABLES IN MOST INSTANCES BECAUSE HIP ACOSTA MEDICAL. I WAS- COMMUNICATIONS THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT DON'T ARE NOT SUBJECT TO HIM I KNOW THAT WAS AN ANSWER I HAD RECEIVED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. IN A COMPENSATION SOME HELP PEOPLE SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD- THAT THERE BE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMPANIES WITH OUR- AGENCIES WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE. THAT THIS INFORMATION THIS IS NOT. A TO BE MADE AVAILABLE ANY WAY SHAPE OR- BOB ANY. I'D COME. NEED TO. COME OTHERS OFFER. BEYOND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING IN TO. OF THOSE WHO MIGHT THAT BE- INFLICTED WITH A VIRUS OR TRANSMITTING IT. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND ARE HAPPY TO SHARE- THE CONTRACTS THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AND I CERTAINLY SURE THAT SAME- SENTIMENT AS WELL APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MISTER KELLY- WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT TO SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU. THANK. SORRY ABOUT THAT AND YOU'RE A NEEDED. THE THERE WE GO I KEEP IT IN YOU AND I KNEW IT AND THEN IT GETS MADE IT'S ALL GOOD IT'S ALL GOOD MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO FIRST SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WHO'S WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO BE ABLE TO KICK OFF THIS CRITICAL HEARING WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO PRO TEM. IN HER AMAZING TEAM IS TRULY GRATEFUL TO COME TOGETHER WITH YOU IN GREAT COMPUTER LEADERSHIP BOTTOM CHAIR- I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE I DOCTOR DEAN HER WORK IT IS BEING STRESSFUL TO SAY THE LEAST OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS INTO THE ENTIRE TEAM AT THE COVER ART AND PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN I SAY HOW TRULY APPRECIATE I KNOW WE ALL ARE UP FOR THEIR CAN WORK IN THESE REALLY CHALLENGING TIMES AND I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE. YES XIN. IT'S GOING TO CAN. TO BE CHALLENGE ACROSS THE NATION IN. RIGHT HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE I AM. I TRULY APPRECIATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAKING TESTING. INTO OUR OWN HANDS. AS WE KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE MORE CHALLENGING ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. AND I'D LIKE TO BE A FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND I PROMISE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. MADAM CHAIR ON TESTING IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH A DOCTOR DEAN I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKING AGAIN TOMORROW ON THIS ISSUE BUT LOOK. TESTING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO NUMBER ONE. DETERMINING WHERE THE VIRUS IS NOW. I DETERMINING- WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING LIKE AS FAR AS RE OPENING. I EIGHT HOW WE'RE GOING TO APPROACH THIS VIRUS. IN THE MONTHS. AND YEARS TO COME UNTIL WE HAD THAT VACCINE. I AND HOW DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DETERMINED. WHERE TO PLACE TESTING SITES NOT TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THREE MAIN- TERMINATIONS DRIVE TIME. NUMBER TWO POVERTY LEVELS NUMBER THREE ABILITY TEST FULLY SUPPORT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT RULE CALIFORNIA. YOU LOOK AT THAT MAP WE NEED THE LUNCH WEBSITE WHERE TESTING SITES. OUR STATE SPONSORED TESTING SITES ARE LOCATED. AT THEIR NON WILL CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. I'M YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE NORTH COAST NORTH COAST RUNS FROM THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE SHOULD THE ORGAN. 40% OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL. I'M TO BE ABLE TO GET FROM THE TESTING SITE IN CINEMA COUNTY. TO THE CLOSEST TESTING SITE NORTH IT'S A FOUR HOUR DRIVE ON ONE ONE FOUR HOURS. FOUR HOURS. BY PASSES MENDOCINO COUNTY COMPLETE I'M YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES IN THE STATE IT'S IN RURAL CALIFORNIA SO I NEED ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU DRIVE FROM CLEAR LIKE TO SANTA ROSA. IT'S THE CLOSEST TESTING SITE FOR LAKE COUNTY THERE ARE NO STATE SPONSORED TESTING SITES LIKE AND IT'S AN HOUR AND A HALF. ISN'T CITY. RIGHT IN DELAWARE COUNTY THE NORTHERN MOST COUNTY THE STATE IT'S A TWO HOUR DRIVE. I'M WEAVERVILLE THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY. IT'S AN TRINITY COUNTY IT'S TWO AND A HALF HOURS OR IF YOU GO OVER THE HILL THE OTHER WAY. WE'RE READY. I SAY ALL THIS IS WE THEN TELL RURAL CALIFORNIA. THAT RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR AN OPT IN SEARCH SITE. I WE'VE HAD OUR BUDGET. AND. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK ON A WORK AROUND. SO THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW CRISIS STATE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A STATE SPONSORED SITE THERE ARE RULE COUNTIES THAT CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FEWER THAN SIX TOTAL PEOPLE IN APARTMENT. YET IF YOU CONTINUE TO OPEN UP AND TELL THEM. WE HAVE TO BE BASED ON SCIENCE AND HAVE THE SIGNS THE FINGER TIPS. BUT THERE ARE GONNA BE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES IN MEETING THESE COUNTIES ARE WHERE EVERYONE IS GOING TO WANT TO TRAVEL THIS SUMMER. BECAUSE AIR TRAVEL IS GOING TO BE OUT BACK LESTER. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS IT THEY'RE GONNA SIR GOING TO RULE SPOTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO IF WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE HAVE TO BE PROVIDE TESTING FOR ALL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- IT'S RUNNING ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION A MONTH. ONCE WE GET FULLY OPERATIONAL WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE EIGHTY SITES SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT ASKED THE CHAIR FOR THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP. FROM THIS. THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION IN. THE WORK WITH A CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY AS WELL AS THAT VERY CAPABLE STAFF. OUR GONNA BE ABLE TO EXT INTO. I AM WE AT STOP THE BUS OR OF A TWO DOES. AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO BRING SOME EQUITY TO THE SYSTEM. I HAVE GREAT CONCERN. REPRESENTING FULL DISCLOSURE MORE RURAL DISTRICT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE STATE OR THE DICE AND I. AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO THROW STONES. AT CALVARY APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THEY ARE WORKING. AT THEIR WORK IN EIGHT STATE SPONSORED- MECHANISM WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T. AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON RURAL IT'S A HUGE GAP IN OUR SYSTEM BY THE WAY IT EXPOSES THE REST OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE'RE NOT TREATING NAME THE SAME AS URBAN METROPOLITAN AREAS. I AND I WOULD LOOK TO DR DEAN IT'S ALL RIGHT TO THE CHAIR FOR ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. WOULD HAVE A BRIEF COMMENT BACK. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU AND- I WOULD JUST ADD JUST ONE OTHER THING I MEAN WE'D BE COMING FROM AN URBAN COMMUNITY- WE HAVE OF COURSE OUR OWN ISSUES BUT WE HEAR OFTENTIMES ABOUT THE ROLE PERSPECTIVE AND WE'VE HEARD REPORTS THAT- IT TO SENATOR MAGUIRE'S POINT. YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE- FROST SEWAGE ESSENTIALLY TESTED IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT COMMUNITY TRANSMETAL. EVERYTHING FROM- PUTTING VARIOUS MATERIALS TOGETHER TO MAKE A SWAP BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TESTING AND- IT JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT- WHICH I THINK IS TO HIS POINT YOU KNOW VERY VERY IMPORTANT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA IF WE CANNOT GET THIS RIGHT IN A REAL COMMUNITIES. SO DR DEAN I'LL PASS IT ON TO YOU THINK YOU. SURE THANK YOU CENTER FOR THE QUESTION. AND THEY GIVE HER KNOWLEDGE IN THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN CALIFORNIA WITH TESTING BUT WE AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND WE AGREE WITH YOU. THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR THOSE RURAL COUNTIES. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH MANY OF THEM. AND IN TALKING WITH THEM. YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THAT WHEN THEY SHARE THE STAFF THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THEY MAY ONLY HAVE TO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES OR A PART TIME PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AND SO THEY NEED SUPPORT. TO STAND UP THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT. THE D. WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE ENOUGH INSTALLED CAPACITY TO TEST. ON THAT IS MEAN ANYTHING IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SWABS IF WE CAN'T COLLECT THEM. AND THEN EVEN IF WE HAVE THE SWAB TO COLLECT THE SPECIMENS WE NEED TO HAVE THE STAFF IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT ARE ABLE TO HAVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ON COME TO THAT SITE. OR MOBILE VANS THAT CAN GO OUT TO COLLECT THE SPECIMENS. ARE CLINICS ARE SAFETY NET CLINICS NEED TO HAVE AN OF SPECIMENS A SPECIMEN COLLECTION CAN'T. SO I AGREE WITH YOU- IT'S A NEED ARE WE DON'T HAVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM SIX YET BUT WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD. WITH THE RURAL COUNTIES- TO FIND SOLUTIONS. WITH THE OFTEN SEARCH SITES WHAT WE DID IS LOOK STRATEGICALLY AT THE STATE INTO OKAY. WE HAVE EIGHTY SITES THAT WE CAN STRATEGICALLY PLACE. WE KNOW THAT THOSE EIGHTY SITES COVER OVER 98% OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA WAS IN A SIXTY MINUTE DRIVE. BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND CALIFORNIANS. ON THAT ARE NOT WITH. THAT DRIVE WHEN SITE. WE ALSO THAT HOW. CAN'T FIVE OR- DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO YOU THE INTERNET. AND SO CAN HARDLY COUNTIES COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS ADDITIONAL ACT AND- I'M HOW. FOR IT. THINGS PRESS. AND TO BE DONE AND WE'D BE HAPPY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTER THIS. LET ME ASK MY YOUR MISTER MOORE. IF YOU WANT TO SET. ANYTHING TO THE ACTS AND WE CAN'T RESIST IS ON THE PHONE YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT NO JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE GOAL WE ARE GOING TO FALL FOR IT AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE. IN SOME CASES MORE CREATIVE IN HOW WE SAW FOR IT BECAUSE AS WE'VE LOOKED AT. SOLVING THAT IN SOME OF THE VERY RURAL AREAS COLLECTION SITE. IT IS NOT A GREAT SOLUTION. BECAUSE OF FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT. OFFLINE FACILITIES ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION I THINK WE'LL GET BETTER EACH YEAR FASTER MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS AND SO. WE CLEARLY NEED TO FALL FOR YOU GREAT THE GOAL WE WILL FALL FOR IT WITH YOUR HELP. I'M IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE COLLECTION SITES- FOR SOMEBODY'S MORAL AREAS BUT WE WILL HELP SOLVE. SO THROUGH THE CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE- BOTH THE COMMENTS. I'M ALL FOR SOLVING FORT BUT I DON'T WANT TO DIS WORDS I WOULD THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT THAT PLAN IS GOING TO BE FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA. IF WE ARE LOOKING AT PUTTING IF WE HAVE THE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST WITH. A VENDOR LIKE OPTIM SIR CAN BE ABLE TO GO INTO A COUNTY LIKE TRINITY FOR EXAMPLE OR COUNTY LIKE MADERA WHO HAD LIMITED STAFF. AND THEN WHAT WE'RE GONNA TELLEM'S YOU HAVE PROP UP YOUR OWN TESTING SITE OR LIKE WE DID MENDOCINO COUNTY WHERE WE HAD AN OUTBREAK OKAY JOB BREAK ON THE COLD LOW RESERVATION WITHIN ST LITERALLY VERY PUBLIC. EMPLOYEE TWO AND A HALF HOURS OVER THE HILL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EIGHT HUNDRED TESTS FOR THOSE RESIDENTS THE COUPLE OF COMMITTING A RESERVATION. IT DOESN'T WORK. SO AGAIN IT'S NOT AT ALL AND TO BE CRUNCHY BUT SAYING WE GOT US ALL FOR IT DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. WE NEED A CLEAR. AND THEN WE NEED TO BE A TO PUT DOLLARS BEHIND THAT PLAN TO EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL. RIGHT YOU'RE HERE IN A BIT OF MY FRUSTRATION BECAUSE AGAIN. I WANTED SPEAK VERY HIGHLY ABOUT DOCTOR DE DOCTOR JANE HAS MADE HERSELF AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE SHE IS. CALLING IN WORKING WITH RURAL COUNTIES BUT WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT. AND THIS IS WHAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH RURAL ALWAYS BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ACTION. IS THERE LEFT BEHIND. I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS AT THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH SO IF OUR- SO CALLED SOLVING FORT STRATEGY IS SIMPLY SAID IT'S AN IMPASSE. AND HAVING THEM GO OUT AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS SOLVING FOR IT MEANS THEY GET EQUITABLE TREATMENT. THAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR THE REST OF THE STATE AND AGAIN. I AM VERY GRATEFUL DOCTOR DAN I'M TECH AND GRATEFUL FOR SECTOR GOLLY. YOU HEARING SOME FRUSTRATION THAT. WE ROLL OUT IN THERE THERE ARE. YOU CAN REALLY DRIVE FOR HOURS AB ONE ON ONE AND THERE'S NO TESTING. AND I'LL ONLY GET THERE AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL DR DEAN OBVIOUSLY FEEL FREE TO CHIME IN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY ON THAT. RIGHT THANK THANK YOU SEE THAT ARE MCGUIRE AND I KNOW ON THIS BOOK THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE DISCUSSING- THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IT'S BASED ON REGION AND OF COURSE- WE'RE STARTING NOW WITH TESTING BUT THE- THE- EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT WE- OF COURSE. RECEIVE SOME ANSWERS- TO ENSURE WERE MOVING TOWARD THE STRATEGY IN PLAN THAT FITS- EVERYONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AT DIFFERENTLY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SENATOR MCGUIRE- NEXT TO ME TO MOVE TO SENATOR. YEAH THANKS VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF THE TASK FORCE FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND ALSO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICERS AS WELL- I KNOW YOU WORKING HARD TO. PROTECT PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTIES IN ACROSS CALIFORNIA IF YOU ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS ARE STARTING OFF WITH TESTING- SO PCR TESTING IS THE CURRENT GOLD STANDARD WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THE NATURE OF THE VIRUSES THAT ACTUALLY. THIS THE VIRUS NEWS FROM THE NASOPHARYNX DOWN TO THE LUNGS- DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU DO IS THE SAMPLE COLLECTION YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY TAKE UP THE VIRUS. GIVEN THE VIRAL LOAD. SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THIS EMPHASIS ONPCR TESTING- BUT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ARE YOU LOOKING AYE COMBINATION STRATEGY NO THERE'S LIMITATIONS ON THE CURRENT STRATEGY TASK. BUT THE MORE ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WHO ACTUALLY IS BOTH CURRENTLY INFECTED. AS WELL AS WHO MIGHT HAVE THE DISEASE AND I KNOW THEY'RE STILL QUESTION MARK. WHAT DOES YOUR ALREADY TEST REALLY MEAN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LEVEL AND A BODY ACTUALLY RESULTS IN AN ACTUAL ARE. ET SO THAT IS A STILL OPEN QUESTION IN SCIENCE- SO WE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT SAME TIME YEAH WE DO PCR TESTING. AND THEN- WE KNOW THAT THE VIRAL LOAD CHANGES OVER TIME AND SO WE MAY NOT IN FACT I THINK THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE- SENSITIVITIES ONLY PCR. AND SO IS THERE A STRATEGY THINK ABOUT COMBINATION TESTING ASTROLOGY AND YOU SEE ARE TO TRY TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON. IT ACTUALLY IS POSITIVE KNOWING THAT'S RELATIVE COURSE TAKES ABOUT EIGHT DAYS FOR FROM TIME EXPOSURE TO SEE SOME ANTIBODY PRODUCTION OR SOMETHING EVEN PICKED UP SO I REALIZE THESE ARE SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT- ULTIMATELY POLICY WHY SCORE WE LANDING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BE SURE WE CAN DOWN A FLIGHT. IS TRULY POSITIVE AND HAVE A BETTER ASSET RESULTS. YES DOCTOR DEAN. YES THANK YOU DOCTOR PLAN FOR THAT QUESTION- WE HAVE NOT- ISSUED A GUIDANCE OR A POLICY FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT SHOULD BE GETTING A SPECIFIC TYPE OF SEROLOGY TASK BECAUSE WE'RE STILL. LOOKING IN WANTING TO SEE- VALIDATION OF SOME OF THOSE TESTS- THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DID- PROACTIVELY IS AS AS THE STATE PURCHASE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TESTS OF THE NEW ABBOTT SEROLOGY TEST SO THOSE ARE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. IT STARTED TO SHIP IN THE STATE LAST WEEK AND THERE'S A RUN ON THE ARCHITECT MACHINE WHICH IS THE MACHINE THAT MANY HOSPITALS I THINK OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY AYE MACHINES ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THEY BELIEVE THE TURN AROUND TIME ON THAT TEST IS AROUND THREE TO FOUR HOURS- BUT WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE AN INCREASE IN SEROLOGY TEST. WELL WE'RE STILL CAUTIOUS- ABOUT RECOMMENDING THAT AND BEING USED IN ANY SPECIFIC GROUP. WE DO KNOW THAT MANY ON MANY OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE LOOKING AT USING THEM AND- CONJUNCTION WITH PCR TESTING. YOU'LL SEE OUR NEW UPDATED GUIDANCE ON A KNOWLEDGE IS THAT IN SAYING ON PCR TESTING WITH OR WITHOUT SEROLOGY. I'M AWARE THAT A NUMBER OF GROUPS ARE LAUNCHING STUDIES A COUPLINGS AS YOU SAID COUPLING UP THE PCR TESTING WITH SEROLOGY. AND HOPEFULLY WILL HELP EDUCATE US ON HOW AND WHERE. CAN BEST BE USED. I'M TO THE POINT ABOUT THAT SENSITIVITY IS BEST. SEE OUR- THE WHAT'S BEEN INTEREST. THE TESTS WERE SOME OF THEM ARE. IMPEDE SEASONING SOME OF THEM ARE THE UP CAN'T. THEY CAN SPEAK MORE TECHNICAL BUT WHAT THEY FOUND IN SOME OF THEIR IN HOUSE VALIDATION IS THAT THE TRADITIONAL PC ARE. ON MAY HAVE A SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY AS HIGH AS NINETY SEVEN AND NINETY NINE PERCENT. I WHICH IS VERY GOOD. AND ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT NEW TESTING MODALITIES- FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE NEW TESTING MODALITIES ARE SWAPPING. I'M INTO YOUR NARES OR THE FRONT OF THE NOSE WHICH IS A SELF WHAT. WE'RE WATCHING NOT THE DATA THAT'S COMING OUT ON THAT CAREFULLY. TO SEE WHAT WORKABLE- OPERATOR ERROR OR SELF SWABBING PLAYS WHEN YOU RUN AND THEN ON THE TRADITIONAL PC OUR MACHINE KNOWING THAT THAT SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY IS PRETTY GOOD. SO I AGREE WITH YOU CONCERN ABOUT ME SEVEN EASIER POSITIVE MAYBE WE GOT THEM A FEW DAYS LATER OR TO YOUR POINT THAT THE VIRAL LOAD CAN VERY AND THEN NEEDS A FRIEND JAIL OR A FRIEND YOU'RE ALL FAIRINGS- WE- WERE LOOKING AT THAT. THERE'S IN SOME WAYS IT'S NOT. CAN I KNOW ABLE RISK WHEN YOU'RE DOING THOSE KIND OF SWABS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS CERTAIN. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. AND JUST YOU'RE NOT DETECTING THE VIRUS SO. I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE DATA ON SEROLOGY TESTING IS IT IMPROVES BUT LIKE I SAID WE PURCHASED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TESTS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT RAMPING UP IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THE SECOND QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU- SO NO PRE SHEET THAT ANSWER I MEAN I THINK YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SINCE THE SPECIFICITY I THINK SOME OF THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT THE TESTING TECHNIQUE IT'S THE ABILITY TO DETECT AND- SO WHAT BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT I KNOW ANOTHER CHANNEL TALKS. SO KISSING ON THAT. IN RELATION TERMS OF THE ACTUAL. GETTING THE TESTING SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT. THINGS TESTING SITES BUT NO LET'S NOT FORGET WE HAVE OUR CLINICAL SITES WE HAVE OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE DOCTORS OFFICES MANY ASSUME AT. LEAST A SOMEWHAT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE STAY AT HOME ORDER SENT ME AB HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING TESTING. DO YOU HAVE BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE TO DESTROY THE LIMITATIONS OF ANY US ROB EARLY ABOUT PHARMACIES. BUT IF THE PEAK OF CONDUCTING THE TEST DON'T HAVE TO FEED. BUT ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE. INSPECTIONS SO YOU HAVE TO WHERE PEOPLE. WHEN YOU DO THAT. I MEAN JUST TAKE A SLOTTED SOMEONE'S. OR MOUTH YEAH COFFERS. ON YOU AS SO YOU GOT A WAY TO KEEP. SO FIRST DOING X. AND SO WHAT ARE WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN TERMS OF SINO INTERSECTS WITH TESTING. TERMS OF THE MAIL BUT A T. T. E. N. THESE DIFFERENT SITES ESPECIALLY HERE ABOUT THE ROLE COMMUNITIES OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. AND SO FORTH BE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT DDT SO THAT YOU CAN DO THE TESTS THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME PEOPLE. TRAVEL FOR OUR CITY GO TO MAYBE A LOCAL CLINIC GET IT DONE. THE OTHER ISSUE I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD IN RELATION TO THAT. IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE SOME CLINICS BECAUSE I KNOW SOME RURAL COUNTIES. THEY DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW. AND THE STAFF IS SMALL SO THEY OFTEN REFERRED ANYWHERE FURTHER CLINICAL- ACTIVITY TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER TABLE PARTNERSHIP THERE- BUT- BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENS OTHER DOCTORS HIS OFFICE MAYBE CLOSE MAYBE REFERRING THEM TO A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER SOME TO ME HEALTH CENTER. INFERRED FROM SOME COMMUTING HEALTH CENTERS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE GET REFERRALS TO DO THE TASK THEY'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT. BUT WELL THE TESTS THEMSELVES GET PAGED BUT ONLY ON THE LAND GET STATE THEY DON'T. GET PAID THEY HAVE TO. SPEND MONEY ON PT HE- HE AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND ORDER TO PROVIDE THE TESTED EXPENSE. SO ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW WE SUPPORT OUR CLINIC IN VARIOUS CLINICAL SITES ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING. THESE TASKS SO THAT THEY CAN AT LEAST GET THEIR EXPENSES COPPER SO WE GET MORE TESTING SITES AVAILABLE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THAT THE TESTING TASK FORCES LOOK AT. MISTER MISTER MARK OF IT SAYS SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CLINICS- YES SO ONE OF THE- BENEFITS OF ENGAGING OFTEN SERVE IN THE PARTNERSHIP IS THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ON PP FOR THE SITE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROCURING ADDITIONAL AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT WITH SPENT. REQUIRES ADEQUATE PP AND WE FACTOR THAT AND WE'RELOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF TASKS THAT WE BEAT THAT WE NEEDED TO DO TODAY. THE BURN RATE OF THE PP. HAVING SAID THAT WERE ALSO TAKING A REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEW- TESTING MODALITIES THAT ARE COMING OUT THAT ARE SELF COLLECTION. SOME ARE MAIL ORDER- SUMMER- SELF COLLECTION VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; SOLID MEDICINE WITH THE&lt;/c&gt; PROVIDER WHERE THEY HE SHOULD ACTUALLY COLLECTS THE SWAB. DROPS IN AN ENVELOPE AND SEND IT BACK AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY USEFUL- FOR THE EXACT REASON OF PRESERVING PP. ON I WANT TO TURN OVER TO MR MARKETS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CLINICS. THANK YOU AND THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IT IT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO GO THROUGH. MORE VETTING AND APPROVAL- BUT- HOW IT IS THAT WE COULD. APPROPRIATELY FINANCIALLY- SUPPORT THE CLINICS. IN THE TESTING EFFORT. AND HAVE THEM OBVIOUSLY HELP AND SUPPORT IN THE TESTING EFFORT SO I'M BAD IS NOT COMPLETED YET- AND WE STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT- WERE HIGHLY COGNIZANT OF IT AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT AND HOPING. HAVE AN ANSWER HERE IN A MATTER OF DAYS. THANK YOU AND JUST TO DO A TIME CHECK AGAIN WE HAVE THREE MORE MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SO IF WE CAN JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MOE SUSPECTS DISTINCT IF I CAN ASK RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND SENATOR PAN OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO YEAH I'D APPRECIATE- THE ANSWERS FROM THE TESTING TASK FORCE AGAIN I WOULD URGE THAT WE THINK ABOUT I KNOW YOU TO TALK MY OPTIMUM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WIDER NETWORKS AND ACTUALLY PROVIDERS THAT PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH SO PARTICULAR RURAL COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO REACH OUT BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPLIS THEY NEED- I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU LOOK AT GOAL OF SIXTY THOUSAND. TO EIGHTY THOUSAND MY GUESS IS THAT AS WE START TO OPEN UP YOU GONNA HAVE MORE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA NEED ROUTINE TESTING DOES NOT MORE EXPOSURE SO I THINK HOPEFULLY WE WILL KEEP PUSHING TOWARD A HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT'S FOR DAY- EVEN CONTAINMENT WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES. MY FINAL QUESTION IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO CONTACT TRACING- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW AND PRESENTATION. YEAH DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE YES STATE WORKERS ENTRANCE FROM OVER A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA TRANSFER OVER. THE DISTENDED MAKES NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON AND AS MUCH AS- YOU KNOW WE'RE GOOD EVENTUALLY IDEA MAXINE THAT'S GOING ON TAKE IT LEAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOT LONGER TO GET THERE ARE SOME TREATMENTS- SO WE'RE GONNA BE DOING CONTACT RACING FOR A LONG TIME. AND I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE ARE TRANSLATE OVER. THE WORD JUST SITTING AROUND THEY WERE DOING VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH JOBS SO I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS THAT WHAT'S THE ON YEAH WE NEED THEM NOW SO I GOT IT WAS SHIFTING OVER TO DO CONTACT TRACING. WHAT'S OUR LONG TERM PLAN TO CREATE A SUFFICIENT CONTACT RAISING STAFF ALLOWS THE PEOPLE GOT TRANSFERRED OVER EITHER GO BACK TO BEING A REGULAR JOBS THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT. OR ELSE OUT OF SOMEONE ELSE JUSTICE THOSE JOBS AS WELL BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CAN'T JUST CURRENTLY HAVEN'T ARE TACKLE DEALT INFRASTRUCTURE JUST FOCUSED. ON THE NINETEEN REALIZE IT'S THE MEDIA SHE WE HAVE NOW BUT NEXT YEAR. SO WHO HAVE DOES HE OTHER INSTEAD. MR LOTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON. SO CAN OR. COUNTY PUBLIC PUBLIC OFFICE. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT IT'S SET. UP STATUS. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. AND LET'S SEE WHO WE HAVE HERE. THAT WAS DIRECTED TO OKAY DOCTOR DAVIS WILL GO AHEAD AND MEET YOU. OKAY RURAL AREA YES THANK YOU. YEP AND BETTER PADDED REALLY APPRECIATE BACK QUESTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE SHIP PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES THAT THEY TAKE AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS THAT A DEFENSE- ON IT WELL. THINGS WERE LOOKING AT OUR WINDS ARE THERE OTHERS WHO ARE ALREADY OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AS I MENTIONED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO. ARE PROVIDING EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AND IF THE OFFER A FUNCTION THAT THEY ALSO HELP THE SERVER OR ACT. IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ANY TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL THE SPEED UP SOME OF THE COMMUNICATION AND FOLLOW UP PROCESS IS THAT ARE NEEDED. WHETHER IT'S IDENTIFYING ARE INTERVIEWING IN IDENTIFYING THE CASE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION. FOR KATE CONTACT. OR IF IT IS ABOUT FOLLOWING UP WITH EACH PERSON WHO MAY BE UNDER WARRANTY IN EFFECT ABOUT THEM OR NOT. BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL POLLUTION THAN POSSIBLE OPTIONS THE CONTINUE. MOVING FORWARD IN THAT FASHION ARE WE TO COMMIT TO DOING THAT FOLLOW UP ABOUT IT ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. I DO WANT TO STRESS THOUGH THAT. EVEN IN THAT WAY REALLY HAVE TO BE IT HERE TOO IT'S GOING TO BE THE PHYSICAL DISPENSED BANK. AN INDIVIDUAL- MEASURES THAT PEOPLE PAY WHETHER AT THE SOURCE CONTROL USING A FACEMASK OR ENSURING THAT YOUR WASHING YOUR HANDS. APPROPRIATELY TO PREVENT. THE SPREAD EITHER FROM YOU OR TO SOMEONE ELSE- THINGS ARE GOING TO BE STRONGER- STOP MORE STRONGLY NEEDED AS WE MOVE FORWARD EVER. WHEN WE GET IN OUR WITH BUT WHEN A- BY. TYPE. NEGATIVE UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE POINT TIME AND ALL OF THOSE. THAT'S A PRETTY YOUR EACH ABOUT THAT AND IF AND THOSE AROUND THE OUR LOVE ONE. ARE GOING TO BE MY MORE NAY ACTING. OR AND GIVE US AN ALLEY TALK ABOUT FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT WE WHAT KIND OF FUNDING THE STATE MIGHT BE SEEKING FOR CONTACT TRACING SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A COUPLE OF CONTRACTS AND RICHARD THEM I'M FOR THE CONTACT TRACING DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND PEOPLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE TREATING. WE ARE PLANNING TO RE DIRECT STATE EMPLOYEES NOT ONLY FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING AND WE ARE- HOPING TO HAVE SIX MONTH DEPLOYMENTS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. INVESTMENT IN TRAINING FOR PEOPLE DOES NOT ALLOW US TO HAVE PEOPLE TAKE SHIPS OF TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD ROTATE IN AND OUT. AND WE ARE WORKING ON WHAT THAT WILL LOOK I CAN AND IF WE DON'T. THE ABILITY TO REDIRECT AN OFFICE STAFF AND WE WILL HAVE A FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR YOU. OKAY SO I APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE STATE STAFF DID YOUR RE DIRECT YEAH I'M ASSUMING THAT JOBS ARE CURRENTLY DOING. DIRECTED ARE STILL. TO AND WHILE THEY MAY BE PUT ON HOLD TEMPORARILY WILL NEED TO BE RESUMED AT SOME POINT. WE HAVE A WORKFORCE. PROPOSAL SINCE I DON'T EXPECT THIS CAN DAMAGE TO GO AWAY BY NEXT YEAR. TO BE SURE WE TRAIN UP ENOUGH ABSOLUTE THIS WEEK BACK TO KEEP READING HOLES IN OTHER. CAPITALIST FINALLY. AND I JUST WANT TO. DANCE BUT THAT CENTER. RIGHT YES. ACTRESS FOR DATA IT'S ABOUT SETTING RULES FOR PROTECT COMPANIES ANYBODY ELSE GET DATA ABOUT CROWD OF THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW BE SURE IF THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY HIP OUR STATE PRIVACY LAWS WE MAY NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT THEY'RE GOING AROUND ADVERTISING SOMETHING SAYING THAT THERE'S GOING TO HELP YOU CONTACT TRACING A NEED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH PRIVACY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT. NOT ONLY HEALTH DATA PERSONAL DATA IS NOT IN USE OR MISUSE OUT BY BY THOSE COMPANIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR PAN WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND THEN- MOST CERTAINLY NOTED- NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR PORCHES AND THEN WE HAVE SENATOR UMBERG AND SENATOR COMING. SENATOR GORGEOUS. I'M NOT SURE ACTUALLY WITH- WITH THROUGH MY- MY HAND RATES ALLOW WAIT TO THE NEXT TO THE NEXT GROUP AND OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SENATOR UMBERG. UP HERE ALSO FOLLOW QUESTIONS CONCERNING CONTACT TRACING. OF THOSE BY A CURRENCY- BUT- WHAT SKILL SETS ARE REQUIRED FOR SOME OF THE ENTRY LEVEL CONTACT TRACER I GET THE WHOLE LANGUAGE ABILITY. THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. AT WHAT IS SORT OF A RANGE THAT ONE COULD EXPECT ON IS A CONTACT RESEARCH- TERMS OF CONVERSATION. NUMBER THREE YES JUST A BASIC QUESTION SO YOU HAVE A- FOR EXAMPLE EIGHT A CLERK AT A GROCERY STORE WHO COMES DOWN WITH. THAT NIGHT HE ALL. WHAT DO YOU OBVIOUS TRACE PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUT WILL POST TO YOUR TRICKS YOU. BE SORRY ACOSTA RICE SO ANYWAY IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THOSE I WOULD BE GRATEFUL AND THE LAST POINT IS THAT WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY OF A DIRECT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION TO SB NINE EIGHTY WHICH HE- JACK'S. YOUR SHORT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG SO WITH THE QUESTIONS REGARDING CONTACT TRACERS THE END YOU KNOW WHAT THAT CONSTITUTES AN ENTRY LEVEL CONTACT TRACER COMPENSATION- WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. I DON'T HAVE ANY HANDS RAISED AT THIS MOMENT I'M SORRY MISS BOSSY THANK YOU. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MEET ON ME VIEW. THERE YOU GO. SO I COUPLE TOOK I COVERED A COUPLE POINTS IT IN MY PRESENTATION I'LL GO BACK TO THOSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL CONTRACT RESEARCH TO HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL LAKE CULTURAL AWARENESS AND SOFT SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD TRUST WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEY NEED TO HAVE A COMMUNITY CONTACTS IN THAT COUNTY- IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE ASSIGNED. BUT THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE ABILITY TO HELP BUILD TRUST VERY QUICKLY WITH OTHERS- THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT THE TRAINING THAT'S PROVIDED BOTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THEN THE STATE TRAINING THAT'S AVAILABLE I'M COMPENSATION IS GOING TO GOING TO VERY QUITE A BIT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY- BASED ON COST OF LIVING IN THAT KIND OF THING. BUT WE COULD PROBABLY PROVIDE A RANGE TO YOU- COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INVESTIGATOR- POSITION DESCRIPTIONS A AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. BOB I HAVE GROCERY STORE EXAMPLE. IF WE HAD A POSITIVE OUT OF GROCERY STORE A THERE'S AN IN DEPTH SURVEY THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DOES COMPLETES WITH THAT PERSON. AND WE IDENTIFY WHO ARE CLOSE CONTACTS AND A CLOSE CONTACT IS DEFINED AS A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN WITHIN SIX FEET. OF THE COVERT POSITIVE INDIVIDUAL FOR A TEN MINUTES OR LONGER. SO IF THEY WERE AT THE CHECK OUT- AND- THEY WERE. MOSTLY DOING- LIKE NOT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THERE UTILIZING CASH BUT PEOPLE ARE PAYING WITH CARDS AND THEY'RE NOT- PHYSICALLY TOUCHING THE SAME ITEMS WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY CONCERNS. ESPECIALLY IF THAT- CASH CASHIER WAS WEARING A MASK AS THEY SHOULD BE OR IF THERE'S LIKE THE GLASS IN PLACE SO THERE'S DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WE CAN CENTER. AT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE WHO CAN CONTACT AND WAS A CLOSE CONTACT. AND IN MADERA COUNTY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT- OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPENING UP BUSINESSES. OUTWARD DEFINITELY- ENCOURAGING BUSINESSES TO HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CONTACT WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS OVER THE COURSE OF A DAY AND HAVE IT AT A TRACKING MECHANISM SOME KIND. THAT'S ALL AND TERRY- BUT THAT WOULD HELP US IN CONTACT TRACING FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU. BUT I'M SURE IF I JUST FOLLOW. YES PLEASE YOUR MUCH THE EXAM. UP WE'RE GETTING I'M SURE ALL OF US ARE GETTING UP LOTS OF INCREASE UNEMPLOYMENT IS HUGE STATE RIGHT NOW SO WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET OUR ARMS AROUND WHAT WE DIRECT SO DOES THIS PERSON THEY NEED A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE THEY NEEDED A PHD. IS A MINIMUM WAGE JOB IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR YOUR JOB WE'RE WE'RE DOES IT ALL I MEAN JUST ROUGHLY. I ALSO THINK DOCTOR DAVIS HAS HIS HAND UP AS WELL- DOCTOR DAVIS WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW I GREW UP WITH THAT EARLIER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE OUR RANGE OF. FOR VARIOUS MISSION I DO THINK THAT IN GENERAL THERE- THERE CAN BE A BROADER RANGE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE. A CLINICAL PERSON. THAT CAN DO SOME OF THAT- THAT'S PART OF THE CONTRACT BOB. SO WE CAN GO BACK AND FIND THE DISMEMBERMENT I'M SORRY BUT BARRY RANGES- IF THE FACT THAT FIRED. I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ON THE EXAMPLE THAT IF. WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT BY DEFINITION THE TECHNICIAN AT THE- FORTY HOURS BEFORE THEIR- WITH THAT SAME. AND TIMES. THEN WE HAVE LIKE WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST I WOULD BUY CAN BE ABLE TO VOTERS THANK YOU KNOW PUT UP A PUBLIC NOTICE AND- DONE A PUBLIC LEAVE. THE FAITH YOU ARE AND THE LOCATION YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED IN YOUR THE TEPS THAT YOU NEED A- IN ORDER TO. MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND CONTINUE TO WATCH OUT FOR. THERE ARE PROPERTIES THAT ARE IN PLACE. BASED ON THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE GET AND WE CAN ACTUALLY REACH OUT THAT WE ARE. ABLE TO REACH DIRECTLY BUT ENOUGH THAT THE FEDERAL WE CAN'T WE HAVE TO DO A PUBLIC NOTICE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PUBLIC. AWARE OF. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BUT ALAS I WONDER CONGRATULATE SENATOR DAUGHTER. EXCELLENT AREN'T YOU. THANK I THINK YOU MENTIONED QUARANTINE BEARD SO BY. DULY NOTED THANK YOU SENATOR. EXCELLENT YOUR YES MOST DEFINITELY THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND THE WE HAVE NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- FIRST LET ME THINK THE PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY I- REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND ALSO YOUR COMMITMENT TO. HELPING THE STATE OVERCOME THIS DEADLY DISEASE- ONLY YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVEN'T FOCUSED ONTHIS ISSUE BUT I WANT TO MENTION IT BECAUSE- IN MY DISTRICT THIS IS A BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS THAT- EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS TO GET TESTED CAN GET TESTED- AND I AND I MEAN THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND WHETHER YOU'RE IN DOCUMENTED- THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT UP. THE STATE WANTS TO MAKE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT- AND I ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE REGARDING RURAL COMMUNITIES- MY DISTRICT IS A RURAL COMMUNITY AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS WELL SOME OF THE ISSUES THERE'S A LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE TESTING- MODALITIES AND HOW THEY WORK. AND WHETHER RURAL CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE THE SOPHISTICATED TESTS COME THROUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT- IS IT NOT ONLY THAT THE TESTING SITES BE AVAILABLE BUT ALSO THAT THE- QUICKER TESTS- ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS WELL AND THERE'S ALREADY A SENSE ON THAT. AT THE- DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES HE IS NOT- DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF THE ISSUES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND THAT- THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE SO THAT THIS SENSE THAT IT'S NOT FAIR IS ALREADY OUT THERE- BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT- DATA COLLECTION. AND DAM AND JUST GET A SENSE OF WHETHER YOU WERE COLLECTING THE RIGHT KIND OF DATA TO GET BACK TO SOME OF THEM THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY SENATOR JACKSON- YOU KNOW THE DATA BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT AND FOR LOOKING AT. WHO CAN OPEN AND HOW QUICKLY AND IN WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE DISEASE- MANIFEST ITSELF AND- THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE WITH MAKING SURE THAT WERE IDENTIFYING THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO HOUSING CONDITIONS BECOME VERY IMPORTANT IN MANY OF MY- IN IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF MY DISTRICT HOUSING OVERCROWDING IS SIGNIFICANT AND YOU HAVE MANY ON RELATED INDIVIDUALS THAT RENT- THE UNITS. THE OCCUPATION BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT TO PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT- THE M. EMPLOYMENT SITUATION WHICH IS YEAH IN AGRICULTURE MANY TIMES PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON MACHINES AND THEY REQUIRE YOU TO STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. AND SO- THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR- THE THAT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IN THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS- AND ALSO A QUESTION AS TO. WHY WE ARE USING SENTENCE TRACK INSTEAD OF IDENTIFYING- IT IS CITIES BECAUSE MANY OF OUR SENSES TRUCKS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- INVOLVES COUNTY AND INCORPORATED PROPERTY WITH- A VERY DENSE CITY URBAN TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE DATA IS LIKELY TO BE SKEWED WE'VE SEEN THIS OVER THE YEARS WITH. ON DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BETTY ITS COLOR BY THIS MADE THAT THAT REALLY DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO- THOSE WITH THOSE ISSUES BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THEN FINALLY AT THE AT AS A KIND OF A POINT. IS THAT. I HAVE A QUESTION IT'S A FIRST TIME TODAY THAT WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT. LEAVING ISSUES UP TO THE COUNTIES. TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO- TO REGULATE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD- SOME OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS SHOULD BE. PROTECTED AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE SIX DISTRICTS AS PART OF MY SIX COMPANIES AS PART OF MY DISTRICT AND EACH COUNTY DID SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN REGARDS TO FARMWORKERS. AND WHETHER EMPLOYERS SHOULD PROVIDE PROTECTIVE. EQUIPMENT WHERE THEIR- THERE WAS THERE WERE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TO GET TO WORK MANY OF THEM COMMUTE TOGETHER AND NOT AND WHETHER THE AND EDUCATION- PROGRAM PRIOR TO STARTING EMPLOYMENT BECOMES IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE A- TEMPERATURE- TAKEN BEFORE THEY GO. BEGIN TO WORK IT JUST DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO HAVE STARTED SOME TIME AGO AND TO HAVE THAT THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS HAS BEEN- DIFFICULT TO GET ARMS AROUND AND TO. TO REALLY BE ABLE TO- EDUCATE FARMWORKERS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO AND I KNOW YOU- CONCURRED WITH A LOT OF THE COLLEAGUES ON LGBT Q. ISSUES ROLE ISSUES OF COURSE- AND- OF COURSE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS RELATED TO DATA COLLECTION CENSUS TRACT. SO WE'LL START THERE FIRST- AND THEN OF COURSE ESSENTIAL WORKER GUIDANCE- ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO FARMWORKERS SO WE'LL START WITH THE DATA COLLECTION AND CENSUS TRACT. A QUESTION FROM SENATOR COMING AT ALL AND WE HAVE DOCTOR DEAN. I'M ACTUALLY RAISE MY HAND TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU MISTER MARK OF ITS ON THE PHONE TO RESPOND TO THAT DATA QUESTION GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT. MISTER MARKOVIC YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATORIAL FOR THAT QUESTION IT. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING YEOMAN'S WORK RIGHT NOW TO GATHER THE DATA THAT YOU HE- IN TERMS OF TESTING AND OTHER CATEGORIES AND- REAL TESTAMENT TO THEIR EFFORTS THAT WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE'RE GETTING AND- IN ORDER TO BE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING- THE STATE IS GOING TO NEED. A MUCH MORE INTEGRATED DATA STRUCTURE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA BEING COLLECTED AND FIVE LOS BUT IT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED. IT NEEDS TO BE HELD IN A PRIVATE AND SECURE MANNER AND IT NEEDS TO BE. APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. ON THE STATE MAKE SURE THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER- YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THAT CAPABILITY. IN PLACE- IN A REASONABLY. FAST MANNER SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS ANOTHER SURGE IN CASES. WERE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS- ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING TESTED IN THE HOSPITAL- WHICH ETHNIC GROUPS FOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION ARE THEY- WHAT- WHAT IT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN. YEAH GROCERY AND OTHER- A POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES THAT WE SHOULD KNOW AND UNDERSTAND SO BEING ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS REQUIRES. BILLION DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES IN INTEGRATING IT ABOUT THE VERY IMPORTANT CAPABILITY I THINK THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. AS THE MOST DEFINITELY THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER MARKETS AND THEN- QUESTION RELATED TO ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR FARMWORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. SEE I'M GONNA JUST PICK ON SOMEONE MEANT I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN GUIDANCE PUT OUT THERE BUT IF WE CAN JUST- ELABORATE ON THAT A BIT MORE- BECAUSE I KNOW MANY OF OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE STILL- VERY IN VARYING DEGREES OF UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT- TO DO- AT THE WORKPLACE SO I'M GONNA KICK IT OFF TO DR DEAN AGAIN- TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. SURE I'M THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I CAN TELL YOU THE WAY THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT TESTING OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND ON THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS IT THERE HAD THEIR SIMPLY HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TESTING CAPACITY ON TO DO THE LEVEL THAT WE WOULD LIKE. TO DO AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS VIRUS IS SPREAD ISN'T A SYMPTOMATIC THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SYMPTOMS THE POINT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS OR- APARTMENTS TO LIVE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER ON THAT THAT'S A RISK FACTOR FOR SPREADING THE DISEASE. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT TESTING- ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHETHER THEIR FOOD YOU KNOW FOOD SUPPLY WORKERS OR ON HEALTH CARE WORKERS OR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS- THE NUMBER THAT'S BEING USED AS EVERY FOURTEEN DAYS- THAT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GUIDANCE PER SE BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BENCHMARK THAT'S BEING USED OF HOW OFTEN SOMEONE THAT HAS- A HIGH RISK FOR EXPOSURE. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE A PERIOD OF TIME TO RETEST THEM- IF CASTING WAS UBIQUITOUS AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LIMITATIONS YOU KNOW SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THAT TESTING SHOULD BE DONE EVERY SEVEN DAYS OR EVERY DAY. UNDER THE CAR LIMITATION WE DON'T HAVE THE BILL TO DO THAT I'M IN AT IT IS YOU KNOW WHAT ALL COMMUNITY. I'M AND IT IS FARM THAT SOME THAT WERE IN. WITH THE LOCAL OFFICER ABOUT OF HOW CAN WE TRAVEL ASPECTS MEN CLICK SITES IN THOSE UNITY TO BE ABLE BY THE LEVEL OF I SEE WE KNOW WILL BE NECESSARY. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT LIVE I'M IN CLOSE QUARTERS EACH OTHER IN A PART BUILDINGS. ARE IN REGULAR ON. WITH OTHER HOUSEHOLD. WE KNOW THAT SIMPLE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS TO LOOK AT IN ADDITION TO JUST OFTEN SERVE SIZE BUT WHAT KIND OF- SUPPLIES WE NEED TO BE GIVEN TO THE LOCAL YOU KNOW THE SAFETY NET CLINICS FQHC CLINICS IN THE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. SO WE DON'T LIKE I SAID WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THAT SOLD TODAY WITH THE- SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE BUT WE'RE WORKING ON AND WE KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR DEAN. SHEET THAT AND THANK YOU SENATOR COMING AT ALL- I'M GOING TO. THE NEXT GO TO SENATOR JIM JONES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK IT- MY FIRST CONCERT I THINK IT'S JUST A QUICK COMMENT MY SECOND- MAY BE A QUESTION THAT MAYBE FOLLOW UP FOR A COMMITTEE STAFF. I DO WANT TO CONCUR WITH SENATOR WINNERS- CONCERNS EARLIER. ABOUT PRISONERS BEING RELEASED- WITHOUT BEING TESTED I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT- ITEM THAT WE SHOULD WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SECOND THING IS ON THE WORLD ISSUES. I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW- RURAL AREAS IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL- THAT. COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE HOURS AWAY FROM THE URBAN CENTERS AND CERTAINLY- THE LARGER HOSPITALS IT WOULD BE DOING THE TESTING- I UNDERSTAND THIS- SEEM A CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION OF SENT A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR ASKING FOR AN EXECUTIVE ORDER- TO ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO DO THE TESTING. I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE FINAL PANEL SEVEN ANSWER THAT THAT'S GREAT- IF NOT THEN I THINK IT MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE- FOLLOW UP FROM THIS. COMMITTEE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ASKING FOR THE STATUS OF THAT AND- YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE GOING TO APPROVE THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WHEN. AND IF THEY'RE NOT WHY NOT. SO THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN PLEASE BUT WILL CERTAINLY- NOTE THAT NOTE THAT AND PROVIDE THAT AS HOMEWORK FOR. BUT THIS COMMITTEE IN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PANELISTS THANK YOU. GREAT I THINK WE'RE DONE THERE I ACTUALLY JUST HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND THAT. MINE WILL BE DIRECTED TO- DOCTOR DAVIS IN LA COUNTY MONEY BUT MANY OF MY STATEWIDE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED THANK YOU- BUT DOCTOR DAVIS I KNOW- IN LA COUNTY WE'VE HAD. OF COURSE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CASES AND YOU ALL ARE WORKING SO VERY HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY WE WERE RECEIVING YOUR- YOUR UPDATES BY BOTH YOURSELF AND DOCTOR FOR ERROR SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR HARD WORK THERE- I JUST HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO- MOBILE TESTING SITE SPECIFIC TO AREAS LIKE THE SKID ROW AREA WHERE- A BULK OF OUR- RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- HAVE HAD. AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY'RE NOT TESTING SO. I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT- WE CAN DO IN THAT RESPECT TO- CONTINUE MESSAGING TO- OUR RESIDENTS AND THESE CONGREGATE SORT OF ENVIRONMENTS TO GET TESTED AND WHAT OTHER. KIND OF. CHALLENGES BUT ALSO LEARNING- OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE GOING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING- IN PARTNERSHIP WHERE A LOT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE DIVISION THE HOUSING FOR HELP. AS WELL AS THE CITY- AND THEIR STAFF AROUND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH IT BUT AND ALMOST. AND WE HAVE HEARD THE SAME THING IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT REALLY WANTING. I BELIEVE IT IT MAY GO BACK TO OUR COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT IT BUT THEY ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU FOR FREE TO GET IT AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT- WE WERE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY- AS THEY WERE IMPLEMENTING PROJECT FROM YOU YOU OFFER. LOCATIONS BURKE YOU BOTH THE COME OFF OF THE STREET AND THE HOUSE THEY WERE OFFERING THAT. AS WELL BUT THAT PARTICULAR AND- A PERSON WHO WOULD AFFECT THE POP BUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN. IN A LOCATION WHERE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ISOLATED. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THEM SPREADING OTHERS. I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK CLOSELY AT WHAT OTHER POTENTIAL ON AND IS THERE MIGHT BE. IN THAT REGARD. WE HAVE HAD A STRONG EFFORT TO TRY TO. GET PEOPLE WHO ARE RENTING ALMOST THAT INTO EITHER A SHELTER LOCATION OR HOUSING LOCATION. IN RDER TO PUT THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES FOR HAND WASHING BETTER. EFFECT I THINK THAT ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT THAT. I AM PREVENT- GETTING THE FILM WHILE. BUT I THINK. WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MAKE THAT ARE COMFORTABLE DECISION BUT THOSE ARE EXPENSE AND ALMOST THAT. TIME IN ADDITION TO FROM IN A BROADER COMMUNITY TO PAY OFF OF THE HEARING. WELL I DO WANT TO- BUT OF COURSE THE MOMENT JUST GO BACK TO THE DATA QUESTION. I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE MANDATED IN TERMS OF STATE REPORT. THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT. HAVE A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION. IN THERE HAVE TO BE A BETTER MAPPING OF THE- I TYPICALLY WERE BETTER ABLE TO GET. ANOTHER RACE ETHNICITY DATA. FROM THE HOSPITAL- BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS REPORTED THROUGHOUT. IN ADDITION THE LAB REPORTING IN THE TERMS OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS. THE CITY IS NOT EVEN A REQUIREMENT. HAS BEEN PAID TO FILL TO BE RECORDED- IN TERMS OF STATE RIGHT. ALSO THERE NEED TO BE FROM CHANGES THERE- BUT I AGREE WITH MR MARCUS BUT THERE ARE THINGS. THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE THERE ARE READY BUT THEY MAY NOT BE MAPPED AS WELL. IN ORDER TO GET BACK DATA REPORTED. I'M SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE MECHANISMS THERE. ARE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SEXUAL ORIENTATION ALTHOUGH. WE DID HAVE THAT ON OUR OUR FARM. AND WE DO ASK THAT QUESTION WHEN WE INTERVIEW. CASE THE- IN TERMS OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION- AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT DATA. AS WE ENTER THE- WELL. ABOUT MORE COMMON TERMS OF WHAT WE DO WITH PEOPLE. ON WITH- AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE CITY OF DONE AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS. WHO ARE WORKING WITH THE BOOK AND. ON THE- OFF. THANK YOU. DAVE I REALLY. THAT ANSWER- TO BOTH QUESTIONS AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY- I WILL ALSO PUT A NOTE- OF. PRAISE FOR EACH OF YOU AND WORKING WITH OUR LONG BEACH HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL IN WHICH I REPRESENT- WHICH IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE SYSTEM BUT WORKS VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH LA COUNTY- DEPARTMENT- AND JUST ANOTHER SORT OF THOUGHT I KNOW- SENATOR COMING AT ALL ALSO MENTIONED THIS BUT- WE HAVE. IN MANY CASES LARGE IMMIGRANT- COMMUNITIES AND- I KNOW MOST OF OUR- THE LANGUAGE IN MESSAGING WE PUT OUT THERE IS IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES. OF COURSE IN THE SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY THREE WHICH I REPRESENT WE HAVE IN SOME CASES- CAMBODIAN. COME MY SPEAKING I RESIDENTS. AND ALSO OF COURSE SPANISH- 90% MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKERS AND THE SOUTHEAST LA REGION SO- ANY ADDITIONAL WORK WE CAN DO TO. PARTNER WITH NON PROFITS TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION IN THESE LANGUAGES. I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR CAN CONTINUING TO DO THAT BUT JUST YOU KNOW ANOTHER- IDEA TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THAT AND I THINK YOU AGAIN. GREAT SO WE ARE DONE WITH- THE FIRST PANEL IF YOU BELIEVE THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE ONCE AGAIN. WHAT WE WILL DO THEN IS. SO SORRY I WILL GO ON TO THE SECOND PANEL- IN WHICH OUR FIRST PRESENTER. IN THIS PANEL IS DOCTOR STEVE GOING YES- HE IS THE DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR AND CHAIR DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY AT UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH I WELCOME YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PATIENCE DOCTOR GOING YES. THANK YOU ARE CAN I PUT UP A PRESENTATION YES PLEASE EIGHT OUT LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET THIS TO WORK SO I'M GOING TO. I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS PRESENTATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT IS THE- SENATORS DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO LAY SEND SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY. SENATORS DODD SENATOR WIRE SENATE COP YELLOW SO I HAVE ANOTHER HAD AYE WHERE IN ADDITION TO MY ROLE I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGISTS. PERSON AND A DISTANCE OF MY ROLE IS CHIEF PATHOLOGY UCSD WHICH I ACT IN YEARS. I ALSO AM THE LEAD ALLAH JUST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. WARNING CODE THAT NIGHT SHE I AM A CONSULTANTS TO DR DEAN'S COMMITTEE OF THE TASK FORCE I'M DEVELOPING TESTING AS ANOTHER FACULTY MEMBER. PARTICIPATE ALL TIME FROM UNIVERSITY DAVIS. AND I ALSO CHAIR A COMMITTEE- WHICH INCLUDES THE LAB DIRECTORS AND THE CHAIRS OF OLOGY FROM ALL FIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE MEDICAL CENTERS THAT UC DAVIS. UCSF A UCLA IN LOS ANGELES USED TO EUROPE OR ANY BCS THE AND THAT COMMITTEES BEEN FUNCTIONAL QUITE SOME TIME SO AS CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE. IN SEPARATE I WOULD LIKE A LOT OF US BECAME WORRIED. THAT CALIFORNIA WAS NOT PREPARED. TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF TESTING THAT WE NEEDED. THIS EPIDEMIC AND I. HE AND WORRY TWENTY NINE IS A VERY VERY DAY FOR US THAT'S WHEN THE- RELEASED NEW GUY. ALLOWS I COMPLY CLIA CERTIFIED LABS LIKE THOSE CRESCENT UNIVERSITIES LIKE UCSD. TO DEVELOP- DID NINETEEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTING MAINLY TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU SEE ARE FAST WHICH IS THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE DOCTOR CHARITY IN WAS DISGUSTING YEAH. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING SO HIGH COMPLEXITY CLIA CERTIFIED LAB IS WE RUN BY A BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGIST OR SOMEBODY WITH THE BALLOT GETS TRAINING IT HAS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED SERIES OF REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE. DIAGNOSTICS HOSPITAL ESTATE THERE ALSO TEST OUT DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAB FACILITY WHICH IS CALLED- CLEO WAIT AND THAT ALLOWS MORE SIMPLIFIED TESTING SO THE- POINT IS BEEN RAISED WITH REGARD TO WHY NOT INCORPORATE PHARMACIES. INTO THE TESTING. OUR TESTING PORTFOLIO IN THE STATE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MOST PHARMACIES THAT YOU ON SITE TESTING OR CLEAR AWAY. AT MOST OF THE TESTING THAT THE FDA ALLOWS UNDER EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION AND FDA APPROVAL NOW THAT DOES THE TESTING MACHINES THE HIGH THROUGHPUT THINGS THAT WE USE ARE ARE HIGH COMPLEXITY SO I'LL TALK I CAN AND I CAN ADDRESS THAT IN MORE DETAIL BUT- THERE IS. A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH REGARD THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED AND HOW WE DO IT MY PERSONAL VISION AND I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND TO RURAL AREAS WE NEED TO EXTEND TO PLACES. WHERE FARMWORKERS MAY BE. LIVING JUST STATE YOU. AND MY- PREFERENCE BE TO HOW WE- FASTER. AND GET TO UP YOU KNOW WELL PREPARED OR TO SO THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA WITHIN NINE DAYS OF THE FDA GUIDANCE ARMORY TWENTY NINE THE LAST DAYS OF THE DAY OFF- BUT YOU SEE ES DE ONE WHY WITH THIS FIRST DIAGNOSTIC TEST. ALL FIVE CAMPUSES THAT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WITHIN- WITHIN A WEEK OF THAT DAY. AND THIS SHOWS YOU WHAT OUR CURRENT CAPACITY IS THE PCR TEST OUR THREE PUT HER DAY IF YOU READ THIS OUT. IT'S YOU KNOW. COMING UP ON TEN THOUSAND TEST PER DAY WE WORK IS THE SYSTEM WE CAN GREEN IS THE SYSTEM DISCUSS. OUR PROBLEMS AND ISSUES. AND I WILL ALSO SUGGESTS THAT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT OPINION BECAUSE I THINK. WE NEED TO THINK IN TERMS OF CASTING STRATEGY AND TECHNOLOGY. AND THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND IS EVOLVING FROM ONE IN WHICH GOAL WE NEED MORE TESTS WE NEED MORE TESTS TO. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO USE OUR CATS BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU THAT OF THIS MAJOR CAPACITY YOU SEE IN THE UC SYSTEM. WE DON'T USE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF IT AS MUCH AS 50% OF THOSE TESTS THAT WE COULD BE DOING WERE NOT PERFORMING. AND ONE I WAS ONCE ASKED WHY NOT STEVE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PATIENTS DESPITE AN AGGRESSIVE. OUTREACH PROGRAM WE ALL OFFER SEROLOGY NOW. AND I KNOW- WE'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME DEBATE ABOUT. THE USEFULNESS OF SEROLOGY. ARE WE GONNA TALK FOLLOWING ME AN EXPERT USER OLOGY I WOULD JUST SAY MY OPINION IS I AM AN OPTIMIST. I'M A BELIEVER A WHAT WE CALL THE MEMORY B. LYMPHOCYTE I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THIS VIRUS. IS NOBODY'S BEEN EXPOSED TO IT SO WE'RE ALL WE SEE OPEN NINETEEN WE'RE LIKE INSTANCE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF MOTHER'S MILK. AND SO IT'S A COMPLETELY BRAND NEW CHALLENGE TO OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM. ONCE YOU'VE RECOVERED AND YOU WILL HAVE POSITIVE SEROLOGY IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT. THAT MEANS YOUR IMMUNE WILL YOU GET IT AGAIN HOW LONG WITH THAT I HE LAST BUT I DO THINK THAT SHOWING THAT SOMEBODY AS A POSITIVE STRATEGIES. DECISIONS ALONG WITH THAT. THE UC. A BY THE WAY I IT WAS SENATOR DODD SPOKE ABOUT AN ANTIGEN TEST THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN AN ANTIBODY TEST. ANTIGEN TESTS ARE DETECTING PROTEINS ASSOCIATED BUYER SO SUPPOSED TO BE ARE IN A WHICH IS WHAT WE DO YOU SEE OUR- IT IS ANOTHER WAY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS ACTIVELY INSPECTED AT THE TIME. I WILL SAY THAT IN MY LAB AT UCSD OUR TURNAROUND ON PCR IS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INCLUDING THE TIME REQUIRED TO GET SAMPLES FROM OUR COLLECTION CENTERS WHICH INCLUDE DRIVE THROUGH CENTERS NEED TO CREATED. INTO THE LAB AND TO REPORT THE RESULTS SO I THINK RAPID TURNAROUND TIME IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I HAD ON THE TABLE I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT THE ABBOTT ID NOW SYSTEM. SPOKE ABOUT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY GO BACK THE ABBOTT ID SYSTEM YOU SEE WE'RE USING THAT. THAT IS A ONE HOUR TURN AROUND TIME THAT'S ALSO WHAT YOU CALL CLEO WADE. SO THAT COULD BE USED IN THE PHARMACY OR LOW COMPLEXITY LABORATORY IT'S A LOS THROUGH. ALREADY IT IS FDA APPROVED FOR USE IN DETERMINING MY LAB FOR ME TO DO IT. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO ABOUT A HUNDRED CASPER DAY USING THIS SYSTEM. ABBOTT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD MAKE ENOUGH MACHINES TO DO WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKE TO DO AND DOCTOR DEAN SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT YES. THE SENSITIVITY OF THAT ASSET A IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR HIGH THROUGHPUT PLATFORMS LIKE THE ROCHE AND THE ABIT A QUICK MINUTE THAT WE USE STANDARD LEE HERE USED TO GET STATE. WITH REGARD TO SENSITIVITY I'LL JUST SAY YES. THE VIRUS DOES. TO YOUR LONG. BUT USING THE ROCHE DID IT INTO IN THE PEACE ARE. ASKED SAY THAT WE YOU. WE GET THE CAT AS AS LOW AS HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED. OF THAT SIX. SO WHEN. YOU THE PROBLEM WITH DETECTING AS I ALWAYS SAY LOOK IF THE VIRUS IS ON THE SPOT. WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN DETECT IT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU PUT THE SWAB IN THE RIGHT PLACE CLINICALLY STICK OUT YOU ARE UP TO DOES IN HIS BRAIN TISSUE THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT EITHER. BUT IN FACT THE ASSET HAS A GREAT ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY. AND DOCTOR DEAN WAS CORRECTED IN DESCRIBING THE ANTIBODY TEST. LITTLE BIT LESS SENSITIVITY AND THERE'S SOME ARE. HALF OLOGY MATHEMATICS INVOLVED IN THAT SO WHAT WE DOING IN OUR REGION THIS IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL THE OTHER FOUR CAMPUSES UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. A REAL SHOUT OUT. CHIU UCSF. BECAUSE THANKS TO THE TRANS UPPER BURKE INITIATIVE THEY GOT A GRANT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE TESTING ABSOLUTELY FREE. TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS IT I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC IT IS TO BE USED MORE OFTEN. WE'VE TRIED REACHING OUT AND WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO STILL NURSING WRIST THIS A LOT EASIER TO USE UCSD. WE HAVE A PROGRAM CHEST FIRST RESPONDERS YOU'VE REACHED OUT AND THAT WE ARE TESTING PEOPLE ON HOMELESS FACILITIES. UP WE'VE MAY OVERFLOW TESTING AVAILABLE TO OUR MEN'S HEALTH SERVICES THE REGIONAL LABORATORIES WE SERVE SMALL HOSPITALS. WE SUPPORT THE BA WITH ALL OF THAT AGAIN WITH THEIR CAPACITY AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED ON AVERAGE. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED. BUT HER DATE- I AM PERSONALLY CONCERNED I'VE BEEN QUOTED IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER SAYING BUT I TOTALLY BELIEVE. YOU CST SHOULD HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER UP THROUGH RIVERSIDE. AND I THINK EVERY HOSPITAL THE UC SYSTEM IS THERE. TO TAKE ON REGION'S AND WE CAN'T SUPPORT. AND WE'RE AVAILABLE JUST WHAT WE ARE STATE ASSETS. I WILL SAY I'M VERY YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS CENTER MCGUIRE SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO ACCESS REACH RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND I AM. FAMILIAR WITH THE OPTIMIST TESTING I MAYBE THE A TO THIS AND WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER PLACES. WE'RE WORKING ON WAYS THAT PATIENTS CAN SELF REQUIRE SPECIMENS PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON SALIVA AND THEN THERE IS A- A TEST THAT YOU CAN USE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ALL THE WAY UP YOUR NOSE TO YOUR THROAT SO WHAT HEALTH PROFESSIONAL DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT EVEN IF THAT SUPERVISED BY A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL LIKE WE'RE CONSIDERING. THE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IN BETWEEN EVERY CASTLES THAT IS A WAY TO GET SAMPLES FROM MORE DISTANT SITES. TO STRONG TESTING CENTERS WHETHER IT'S THE UC SYSTEM HOSPITAL OR QUEST OR SOME OTHER LARGE FACILITY WITH GREAT RAPID TURNAROUND TESTING AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF WAYS PRE ON A LITTLE COOL THANK YOU DOCTOR ON IS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- WE WILL. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE WHAT WE CAN GET BACK TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL- AND ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WE WILL TRANSITION OVER TO DOCTOR ALLEN WOO OUR NEXT PANELIST CHIEF OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND TOXICOLOGY AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL AND PROFESSOR OF LABORATORY MEDICINE AT UC SAN FRANCISCO WELCOME DOCTOR WILL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS WELL. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR AND SENATORS THE OPPORTUNITIES PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S. HEARING MY NAME IS ALAN WILL AND I'M A LABORATORY MEDICINE. FASTER AT UCSF WHICH IS ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT'S TRYING TO LEAD THE WAY FOR. EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH ANTIBODY TESTING IN THE STATE SO WE HAVE- DONE THOUSANDS OF RESULTS. AND THAT WE HAVE ADDED THEM WITH THE VARIOUS CLINICAL HISTORIES OF ALL ON OUR CALL THE PATIENTS THAT HAVE. COME THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL FROM DAY ONE AND I'M HERE TO SORT ASSURE YOU JUST BRIEFLY ARE EXPERIENCED AN ECHO SOME OF DR DEAN OF COMMENTS THAT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT REALLY READY TO DISTRIBUTE ANTIBODY TESTING. TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT EVERYBODY POSITIVITY INDICATES A PRIOR INFECTION WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES. WITH CROSS REACTIVITY TO OTHER ARE VIRUSES. BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE- NO GUARANTEE. OF IMMUNITY AND SO AS A POPULATION. HOW YOU CAN USE THAT INFORMATION ARE YOU BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT YOUR POSITIVE OF HAVING AN INFECTION THAT YOU CAN LACKS. ON YOUR SOCIAL DISTANCE SAYING THAT YOU CAN RETURN TO WORK WITH FULL CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE SPREADING THE VIRUS TO ANYBODY ELSE. THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK RIGHT NOW BEFORE GOING TO RELAX THE SHELTER IN PLACE OR WE'RE GOING TO RETURN. EVERYBODY BACK TO. TO WORK AND YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK ECONOMY IS IN RECESSION. HI THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT VERY HIGH. WHAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND SO WHAT I WANTED TO. SHOW YOU ARE COUPLE OF SLIDES THAT TELLS HISTORY OF WE'VE DONE. SO TO GIVE YOU A IDEA WHAT SOME OF THESE RESULTS MEAN. SO HERE. THREE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS I'M SORRY TO. TWO DIFFERENT TESTS FOR- KOBE THEIR BODIES THE MOST TYPICAL PRESENTATION IS THAT YOU GET ANTIBODIES WITHIN THE FIRST SEVEN TO TEN DAYS. I GM COMES FIRST AID IDG COMES LATER BOB I WOULD SAY THREE QUARTERS OF OUR PATIENTS LOOK LIKE THIS. BUT THEN THERE'S A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DELAYED RESPONSE YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT. THIS PERSON DIDN'T DEVELOP ANTIBODIES FOR THREE WEEKS EVERYBODY SAYS WELL CORENTIN FOR TWO WEEKS AND YOU'RE FINE. NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. HERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD A DECLINE IN THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE AFTER TWO AND A HALF WEEKS OUT. IS THIS PERSON A MOON DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AND IS NOW BECOMING A NON IMMUNE WE DON'T KNOW THAT. AND THEN THE MOST INSIDIOUS OF ALL THE DATA IS 4% OF PATIENTS HAVE NO ANTIBODIES AFTER THIRTY DAYS SOME OF THEM ARE IMMUNE SUPPRESSED SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CAPABLE OF RAISING ANTIBODIES. SO THESE ARE DATA FROM A QUANTITATIVE CENTRAL LAB PLATFORM. THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THE FIDELITY OF THIS TEST. IF WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH RAPID POINTED CARE DEVICES SUCH AS SEEN HERE ON THE RIGHT. I THINK THAT THAT'S A MISTAKE. WE OWE THAT RELY. THESE LAST AT LEAST AS CURRENTLY CAN. IS NOT THE NOW FIVE. IF TO THE THIRD FLOOR. WHERE THEY COULD BE. MADE NOT ONLINE. HOW DO YOU PASSED IN IF YOU SAY WELL GET YOUR POP. YOUR GO OUT IN THE- HAVE. A GOOD TIME. IN YOUR PICTURES. AND START THE EFFECTS ALL OF AND I THINK THAT IS. WHAT THE MOST DANGER. SO I WOULD NEED TO SHOW YOU THE BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HAVE AN IMAGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. SO THE SOCK BALL THE VIRUS AND THE- OF THE BOTTOM STRUCTURE IS A OUR LONG CELLS. OF THE VIRUS IS TO RECESS. IT'S HERE. AND THEN TAKES OVER G. OF PROTEIN MAKING CAPABILITIES OF OUR CELL SO INSTEAD OF PRODUCING CELLS ARE PROTEINS THAT WE NEED. IT STARTS PRODUCING VIRUS AND A DEN PROPAGATES ANYTHING THIS ISSUE GOES ON AND ON. ANTIBODIES ARE KEY TO- BLOCKING THE ENTRY OF THE VIRUS TO THE CELLS THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WE ARE ALSO HOPING TO GET. WHEN WE GET A VACCINE. THERE IS ALSO DISCUSSED OF. GIVING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES THAT WILL BLOCK THIS PROCESS SO ANTIBODY PRODUCTION IS KEY BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS OUR ANTIBODIES BEING DIRECTED TO THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST A SO CALLED SPIKE PROTEIN. IN THE VIRUS THERE ARE OTHER PROTEINS THAT ARE PART OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE VIRUS ITSELF. THAT DON'T REALLY INDICATE THAT THERE IS A MUNITY DOESN'T BLOCK THIS ENTRY PROCESS THEN IT'S NOT IMMUNE IT'S ALL BYSTANDER IT TELLS YOU THAT THE VIRUS PROTEIN WAS THERE. FOR TICKETS A STRUCTURAL PROTEIN QUITE FRANKLY IT DOESN'T HELP US IS WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A MUNITY SO THERE IS A GOLD STANDARD TEST. THE GOLD STANDARD TEST IS CALLED A PLAQUE NEUTRALIZATION ASPECT. WHERE WORKS IS THAT YOU TAKE CELLS ARE PETRI DISH THAT YOU CAN RAISE YOU TREATED WITH ANTIBODIES FROM A PATIENT SO THEY HAVE NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AS SHOWN IN THE RED DIAMOND HERE. THEY WILL BLOCK. HE ALSO I FIRE TO IN. THAT SO. THAT IS THE BUT WE WANT TO SEE. IF WE ERA BY. THAT ARE WHAT I SAY BYSTANDERS THAT DO NOT IN NEUTRALIZE THE ABILITY OF THE VIRUS TO GAIN ENTRY TO OURSELVES THEN THIS IS A- NON NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY. IT'S A MY LAST SLIDE IS THIS ONE THIS IS A STUDY CONDUCTED IN CHINA ARE USING ONE OF THE SPIKE PROTEINS AS THE BINDING FOR THE ANTIBODIES SO THE X. AXIS HERE ON THE BOTTOM IS THE RESULT OF A- TYPICAL WHAT WE CALL ALISA ANTIBODY TEST. THE Y. AXIS THE UP AND DOWN ACCESS IS THE RESULT OF THE- ACTUALIZING ANTIBODY TEST THAT WHICH THAT I SHOWED YOU IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. AND THE THREE ZONES THAT I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN RED ARE KEY HERE. HIS OWN IN THE BOTTOM LEFT INDICATES THAT THERE ARE SOME PATIENTS WHO HAVE NO ANTIBODY RESPONSE AND WHO DON'T PRODUCE NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES. NOT IMMUNE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY'RE INFECTED OR PERCENT OF OUR PATIENTS ARE SO EXHIBIT THIS. THAT'S NOT SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM. LOOK AT THE LOOK AT THE TOP LEFT THE TOP LEFT HERE TO PATIENTS OR MAYBE MORE THEY HAVE NO ANTIBODIES BUT THEY HAVE OTHER ANTIBODIES ARE NOT BE DETECTED BY THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE A LICENSE. AND THESE ARE IN FACT. IMMUNE SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO COULD BE IMMUNE EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE ANTIBODIES YOU JUST HAVE TO PRODUCE THE RIGHT ADVICE OKAY SO THAT TOO. IS NOT SO MUCH OF THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE. THE PROBLEM I SEE IS THE BOTTOM RIGHT SET ON IN THE- AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUGHT CONCENTRATION WOULD BE FOR THE NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY IN THIS CHART THEY COULD INVADE EVEN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT CIRCLE. WHAT THESE PATIENTS SYNDICATE AND DOCTORS I CAN ASK YOU TO JUST FINISH YOUR YOUR SITE HERE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS MY LAST STATEMENT OKAY GREAT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I HAVE TO GET IT IN. THESE FIVE PATIENTS HAVE ANTIBODIES. THAT ARE NOT NEUTRALIZING SO IF YOU TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE IMMUNE IS SEND THEM BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE IT'S- A SECOND WAVE OF INFECTIONS SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS MY COLLEAGUES ARE DEVELOPING NEXT GENERATION- ANTIBODY TESTS THAT I HOPE WILL RESOLVE ALL OF THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. VERY INSIGHTFUL WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- AND NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD PANELIST- WHICH IS PATRICK PULLMAN VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER WESTERN REGION OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS. A WELCOME MISTER PLOWMAN. Q. MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS- THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY FOR- BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME'S PATRICK WOMEN ON THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR QUEST DIAGNOSTICS ON THE WEST COAST- WHICH IS INCLUDES CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY AND- IS THE CALIFORNIA IS THE pHEADQUARTERS. SO I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF QUESTS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. OUR VISION THE QUEST IS TO EMPOWER BETTER HEALTH WITH DIAGNOSTIC INSIGHTS THAT SO- MISSION STATEMENT OF WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AND WE HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE HAVE AS OF THIS WEEK A PERFORMED ACROSS THE COUNTRY ONE AND A HALF MILLION. ILA TESTS NATION WIDE SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF ALL. YOU SEE OUR TEST ON MARCH NINTH. AND THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 20% OLD. COVET MOLECULAR TESTING FOR NATIONALLY HERE CALIFORNIA. DATA THROUGH BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK WE'VE CONDUCTED APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND MOLECULAR TESTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SENSE. SOME OF BETWEEN IN THE LOW TWENTIES LET'S SAY OVERALL THE TESTING DONE AND THEY'RE NOT IN THE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WAS YOU KNOW WE'VE A BIG COMPANY WITH TWENTY FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND COLLEAGUES ON TO THANK THEM FOR ALL LOOK BAD DOING COME ACROSS THIS- PANDEMIC ON THE WORKING THE FRONT LINES. BY PROFESSIONALS FOR BOTANISTS AND OBVIOUSLY THE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS PROFESSIONALS THAT WE HAVE. TO WEAR WITH VERY PROUD OF OUR PRESENCE IN COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA- AND OUR RESPONSE IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF OFF LONG TIME COMMITMENT- AND INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WHO CALL CALIFORNIA HOME WE HAVE TO REGIONAL LABS ONE. BASED IN WEST HILLS ONE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE TO BE SO TERAFLOPS WHICH OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO VALENCIA WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PATIENT SERVICE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE A DOZEN RAPID RESPONSE SLASH PROVIDING STAT TESTING. ON OVER SIX HUNDRED CARS VANS USED TO KOREA SAMPLES FROM LOCATIONS ROUTE TO OB. ALL MAY LAPSED SO WE HAVE A BIG INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA- THAT WE THAT. WE HAVE AND WE MADE. SO WE- MARCH NINE. BUT WE ACTUALLY WOULD DEVELOPING LIKE MANY OTHER. ACADEMIC AND PRIVATE LEBAR TREES A BASS SAY. AND THIS IS THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR LABS AS WE ATTEMPT TO HAVE ACCESS DEVELOPED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE CLINICAL NEED AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT pDEVELOPED BY A GROUP HERE IN THESE NICHOLS INSTITUTE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO. THIRTY DAYS OF WE HAVE A NATIONAL NETWORK WE HAVE OVER WHAT WE HAVE TWELVE LEBAR TREES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. COLLECTIVELY WHICH WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PULL THE FORM FIFTY THOUSAND TESTS BUT DAY FIFTY THOUSAND TEST TODAY WE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME. IS LIKE MOST OF THEM TO GO HE'S WAS SAYING. ONE TO TWO DAYS ON AVERAGE AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY VERY MINIMAL BACKLOG. AND THIS IS BEING THE CASE RUNNING A MINIMAL BACK TO OKAY FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS SO WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO EXPAND CAPACITY BEYOND THE FIFTY THOUSAND. BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE EACH OF THESE CODE BASS INSTRUMENTS. IS LIMITED TO. BRINGS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF THREE THOUSAND TESTS A DAY SO IT'S A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE TO SCALE. I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT BRIEFLY TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR SPECIFIC ACTIONS HEARING CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKEN- TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT THESE INCLUDE. TESTING OF DON'T CALVET PATIENTS FROM LOCAL LAW CENTURIES HOSPITALS TO FACILITATE TRANSFER. TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY SHIP MERCY- WE WERE INVOLVED WITH. SETTING UP TESTING FOR THE SEARCH HOSPITALS IN LOS ANGELES SPECIFICALLY LONG BEACH COMMUNITY INCIDENTS SINCE. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE MASS OFFICE ON THE HOME A SURGE- TEQUILA YES Q. EIGHT CITIES. AND WE PROVIDE THE TESTING FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON INMATES WITH TESTING FOR THE LA COUNTY TWIN TOWERS JAIL- AND AS WE CUT TODAY THIS AUTUMN SERVE THE EIGHTY TEST SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT WILL. LOCATING IN THESE TESTING THAT'S THE QUEST AUGUST SIXTIES THE ENGINE BEHIND THOSE EFFORTS WE PROVIDE THE LOGISTICS AND THE TESTING. NOT JUST FOR BOTTOM SERVES BUT ALSO FOR VERILY AND WE SUPPORTED VERILY FROM THE VERY START. WE'RE ALSO INVOLVED IN- ANTIBODY TESTING- WE HAVE TO DATE PERFORMED THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEROLOGY TESTS. ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE AREN'T FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CURRENT THROUGHPUT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ANTIBODY TESTS DAY YOU KNOW. BABS THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE GONNA BE EXPANDING THAT SHORTLY- BY THE END OF MAY TO A QUARTER OF MILLION TESTS PER DAY ACROSS ON NETWORK. SO WE'RE RAMPING UP. THE TESTS HERE I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT CAPABILITIES WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND- HOW WE BEING SERVING. BUT I DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE IS TOP JUST TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. DIAGNOSE X. WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE FOR HOW CRITICAL MOST OFF AND YOU KNOW. AS MUCH. REFER STUDY ABOUT THE PERCENT OF CLINICAL SUSPICION BEING BY AND SO TO PROVIDE BY THE- TESTING YEAH THE DOG. COST ONLY A FOR PRO 3% OF THE HEALTH CARE SPENDING SO DIAGNOSTICS ARE INCREDIBLE VALUE PROPOSITION- BUT REIMBURSEMENT RATES CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED AND THE I JUST WANT TO FINISH ON THIS POINT THE PROTECTING ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT THAT WE HAVE. IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TO OUR INDUSTRY AND OTHERS BECAUSE THIS HAS RESULTED IN A 10% RATE CUT- FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND IT'S THE TECH. CRITICAL BECAUSE CMS% PAYMENT RATES ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY ALL THE PAYMENTS AS A IMPORTANT REFERENCE POINT- SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE- YOU KNOW WILL FAIR REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES FOR THE WORK. AND THE VALUE OF THIS TESTING THAT WE DON BUT IN SUMMARY WE WERE VERY PROUD TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE I'M WHETHER SUPPORTING THE DRIVE THRU FLEXION SITE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. OF THE HIGH RISK POPULATIONS NURSING HOMES AND OTHERS RURAL POPULATIONS AT TWO EIGHT SEIZE CORRECTION FACILITIES THANK WORKING THERE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MAKE SURE WE CAN. SUPPORT CALIFORNIA ANOTHER'S ACROSS ON A TRIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PULLMAN APPRECIATE THAT- COMMERCIAL PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND NOW I ARE ON TO OUR FINAL FOR HER WITHIN THIS PANEL TODAY IS KAREN SAVAGE SAYING ONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA PAN NICK HEALTH WORK- TO DISCUSS TEST ACCESS ISSUES AND WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS WELL. WELCOME AND HAVE A JUSTONE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU ARE. TO BE HERE TODAY BEN REALLY AND HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE ALL THE OTHER ANALYSTS. THAT WORK IT HAPPENING CAN ABOUT FOR WORDS I AND GOT YOUR BUT- CANNOT OF THAT FOR STATEWIDE MULTI CULTURE HELD AT. THE ORGAN. WE WORK WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND ADDRESS. IT HEALTH DISPARITIES. I'M AND I DO WHAT I SAY I THINK WE CAN NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH REGARD TO HEALTHEQUITY I'M IN THAT I THANK THE AND HAVE BEEN AFTER YOU TO FOCUS ON HAVE. HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT ALSO REALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. I'M PARTICULAR AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER ISSUES. AND WE KNOW WHAT HARD TO OUR- TODAY THAT THEIR AND THEIR DIRECT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THANK YOU THE COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE CUP NINETEEN ENDEMIC. COVER NINETEEN IS BUILDING UP BEHIND DECADE BUT BASS THAT AND SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES HAT WE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO HAVE A HIGHER BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE. LET'S ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND ULTIMATELY SHORTER LIKE IT'S EXPECTED THESE. UNLESS WE ACT QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO TARGET EVERY PART OF. OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE. YOU WE WILL LIKE MAKE THEM WORK. EQUITY IN ONE OF THE MEN ISSUES WE MUST. AND IS THE LAND THROUGH WHICH WE FIRST TO THAT RIGHT. I AM IT'S BEEN STATED ALREADY BY JUST AS A REMINDER BLACK WHICH- AND FOR THE CALENDAR TO. ARE OVER. YOU IN IN OUR AT I'M HOPING. BUT DID. ONLY PART OF STORY. I'M FOR. HELP IS NOT. WERE AND DATA I'M BUT NINETY HAD THAT MINISTER BY RATE AND THAT. WHICH WE THAT A WHOLE AND I ENERGY. OF WHO ACCESS AND WHO IN HOW PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED. IF YOU TAKE THAT ARE REPORTING DATA AND HAS BEEN MINISTER BY RACE AND ETHNICITY HAVE FOUND THAT BLACK LET YOU KNOW THAT ARE BACK THE UNDER REPRESENTED. IN WHO IS BEING TESTED I'M WHICH MEANS THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF CASES THAT THAT. UNLIKELY COMING UNDER ACCOUNT AND THE IMPACT THAT THE PANDEMIC IS HAVING. ON THOSE YET EVEN. WE DON'T ONLY NEED. AND AT ALL IN THE- AND BUT WE REALLY CUTTING. OF IN THE- THAT ARE MONTH IN. IT SENATOR WIENER THAT THE- I FROM THE MID DISTRICT IN CAMP AND- GO. WHICH CAN THAT THE VIRUS IS MORE WHY. AND COMMUNITY FOR RATHER HAVE LEFT ACT. TO ACCURATE AND TIMELY. HEALTH INFORMATION. FLEXIBILITY TO SHELTER AND- OR THANK I LATE YOU'RE BEING INCOME. WORK LIVING CREDIT HAVING CAN AND YOU NOT HAVE AN- ACT IT. ADEQUATE TO PROTECTION JUDGES. WAIT AND WE THE TEAM FROM OUR THAT SHE THAT HAVE FOR QUITE LIKELY TO COME BACK I'VE BEEN IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. HI INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. WE REALLY NOW WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND WE DO APPRECIATE. I'M KIND OF THE RECENT EFFORTS BY THE STATE WITH EIGHTY. THE DESKTOP HAVE BEEN FIGHT BUT WE KNOW THAT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED CASTING LOCATIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO REMOVE. IT CASTING SO DOES THAT REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE PART TIME POPULATION BUT YOU'D BE REFERRED BY A DOCTOR. I'M CAN BE A HUGE BARRIER BREAKING THE COLOR WHO ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A ACCESS TO A USUAL OR THAT HEALTHCARE TO. BE ABLE TO GET THAT TRAINING AND GET THAT REFERRAL. AND WE ALSO YOU KNOW FEET. THAT OUR DRIVER. YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR. I'M SORRY BUT BE MORE WHY BUT CAN RIGHT BEING OPENED INTERPRETERS ARE. CAN GETTING ISSUE THAT WE HEAR ABOUT AT THAT. RIGHT I AND LIMITED I HOURS BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY TESTING. YEAH TO. WHEN THEY'RE I'M WHEN I GET OFF. WHEN THEY DONE WHEN I GOING HOME THE DAY. ONE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THAT DIRECT. IT LOOKING. AT THAT WAS COMMUNITY GAS THANK BETTER WHY TRUST. I'M FOR EXAMPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT RIGHT UNITY HEALTH CENTER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. IN A WALK IN RIGHT THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON SERVICES TO FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND BE ABLE TO. I'M REALLY PROVIDED. THAT POPULATION. IN ADDITION FOR BOTH CASTING AND CONTACT TRADING. OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION OUTRAGE. MUST BE MUCH MORE ROBOT. I CALIFORNIA REALLY. THAT TO MAKE THAT HAVE THINGS THAT FOR YOU CHARGE AND REGARD IMMIGRATION THAT. I'M BUT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST. PEOPLE ARE WORRIED THAT GETTING HAS IT WILL IMPACT THEIR OPERATIONS THAT IT. AND PEOPLE ARE SCARED EVERY EVEN A POSITIVE TEST RESULT WILL JEOPARDIZE THEIR JOB. SO WE RECOMMEND USING CRAFTED COMMUNITY MESSENGERS PROVIDE ACCURATE AND TIMELY. AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION FROM LA COUNTY ABOUT THE- COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS I THINK THAT'S- A STRATEGY THAT WE DEFINITELY EMBRACE AND- THINK. YEAH I'M AND THEN FINALLY I GET FUNNY THING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING- WE REALLY WORRY THAT THOSE EFFORTS WILL ONLY BE. EFFECTIVE AT THE ABILITY THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO HELP ISOLATE IF THEY HAVE HOW DID IT WORK THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH. BUT IT POSITIVE WHICH MEANS THAT IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO. HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING OUR STATE IN THAT I'M WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR THE MAJORITY OFCALIFORNIANS WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM HOME. AND WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WORK NETWORK WHO MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION TO ISOLATE. AND WE REALLY NEED TED KOPPEL DOWN ON BUILDING THOSE SOCIAL SERVICES. THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT I MEAN TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL. THE CAN BACK. IN A MOMENT WHICH WE MIGHT HAVE A ON IT. ABOUT RAPE AND EQUITY. YOU CAN. ACTION TO ACT OUT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OP. HAS AT I'M AND TO FOR THEIR GATE. MANY AT ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION VERY INSIGHTFUL- GREAT SO. THIS CONCLUDES THE TWO PANELS AND WE AGAIN APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE HERE. AND WHAT I'LL JUST REITERATE IS THE PUBLIC'S OPPORTUNITY TO DIAL IN BEFORE WE GET TO MEMBER QUESTIONS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO ALL THE PRESENTERS BEFORE WE MOVE ON A MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AS MENTIONED I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. 1-844-291-6364 AGAIN THAT IS. ONE EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX pUSE THIS ACCESS CODE. NINE THREE SIX EIGHT FIVE ZERO EIGHT AGAIN THAT IS ACCESS CODE NINE THREE SIX EIGHT. FIVE ZERO EIGHT ALRIGHT WE WILL MOVE ON TO MEMBER QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST AS SENATOR I HAVE UP IS SENATOR NUMBERS. SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT IS MY HAND IS UP I'M GONNA TAKE MY HAND NOW OKAY NO PROBLEM SO JUST REMIND SENATORS TO RAISE THEIR HANDS AND IF YOU DID NOT WANT TO BE CALLED ON YOU CAN JUST AND DO YOUR TO THE HAND THERE- I HAVE SENATOR BOARD JUST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR BROWN DOCTOR WILL WORK TO DOCTOR ON IN I. S. LOT OF INFORMATION GET CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THROUGH THE MEDIA OUTLETS SO THERE IS US AND COMPETING INFORMATION- ON WHETHER ARE CODED NINETEEN. DEATH RATES ARE OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED. PARTICULAR I USE AN EXAMPLE IMAGINE IN A SYMPTOMATIC HAITIANS. CHOOSE FROM A HEART ATTACK IS THAT PERSON LISTED AS BEING A CO GOOD RELATED YES. AND IF YES PLEASE EXPLAIN IF NO PLEASE EXPLAIN IN OUR OTHER COUNTRIES USING THE SAME TYPE OF METRIC TERMINATIONS. ARE THAT WERE YOU'RE SAYING SO WAS CONSISTENCY IN THE RATES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT ONLINE FROM OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHETHER YOU CHINA RUSSIA SEVERAL. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR JUST WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. BEING ABLE TO DISPEL CAKE DOCTOR WILL THANK YOU. YEAH SO- THE WAY WE KEEP TRACK OF THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME POSITIVITY AND VIRUS IN ORDER TO CALL UP ALL THE DEATH AND OUT OTHERWISE IF IT'S A COINCIDENCE HEART ATTACK AND UNCLE BUT NEGATIVE THREE DON'T CONICAL WITH. A DEATH SO- I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE CAN JUST GO ON SYMPTOMS. HAVE OBJECT OF LABORATORY DATA. PERMISSION FOR A FOLLOW UP. QUESTION CHAIR WOMAN YES PLEASE. THE WHITE HOUSE HAD YOU HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND THE REASON I'M HONING IN ON THIS IS. THERE WAS THERE WERE STATEMENTS MADE AT THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO AT THE TIME HE PERISHED. ARM SUFFERED FROM AILMENT COMPLETELY UNRELATED US EXAMPLE OF A HEART ATTACK. PAN BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF DEATH. HE HAD TESTED POSITIVE. THEY RULED THAT A CO GOOD YEAH. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS OUR- IS EVERYONE WHO HAS CO GOOD. AUG OF TEST POSITIVE FOR COBRA ARE WHETHER NOT THEY PASSED AWAY FOR SOME COMPLETELY UNRELATED COSTS ARE THEY PUT ON THE ROSTER OF CODED RELATED DEATHS. THERE WILL. YEAH SO I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES I CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE A COINCIDENCE THAT SOMEBODY HAS A HEART ATTACK AND ALSO IS CALLED A POSITIVE BUT YOU CAN ALSO ASK DID THE COLD THE DISEASE CAUSED THE HEART ATTACK WE KNOW THAT KOBE IS A HIGHLY CARDIO TOXIC SO IT'LL EIGHT IT IF A PERSON WHO HAD CALLED THEN SURVIVES AND THEN HAD A HEART ATTACK YEAH THEN I COULD SEE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME AMBIGUITY BUT CERTAINLY COLD BIT INFECTIVITY PLAYED A ROLE MORE THAN LIKELY UNLESS THEY'RE COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC IN WHICH CASE. WE MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE COLD ACOSTA. ARE YOU WILL YES OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE MAKING THE SAME METRIC DETERMINATIONS THAT WE ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE. AND I BELIEVE DR GHANI IS ALSO HAS HIS HANDS UP I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CALLING ON HIM IF THERE IS ANY FOLLOW UP TO THAT. QUESTION AS WELL. THIS IS TO GUARANTEE IS I I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A- GREAT DEAL. ROSS THE COUNTRY WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE CO MORBIDITIES IF THEY HAVE HEART DISEASE START IT HAD EMPHYSEMA START THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO END UP. YOU ARE AT VENTILATION WITH THEIR RISKS OF. TRYING TO READ OF IT NINETEEN IS IT GREATLY INCREASE. WE THOSE HIGH RISK GROUPS I DO AGREE WITH DOCTOR WILL IN MOST CASES YOU. IF SOMEBODY IS IT MADE IT BECAUSE THE INITIAL SYMPTOMS BOB THAT NINETY AYE CHANGES IN THEIR LONG LONG SHOWN. YEAH FINAL CAUSE OF DEATH IS PROBABLY RELATED VIRUS AND OTHER CO MORBIDITIES IS TYPICALLY CONSIDERED IN NINETEEN. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU CENTER FOR JUST DID OU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ACTUALLY- LET ME JUST QUICKLY ACTUALLY TOUCH ON% CENTER BOARD JUST THIS QUESTION- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE CULTIVATED. AND YOU DIE OF LOVE FROM A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT THAT'S NOT CANDIDACY COBIT DUST. SO NOT EVERY DEATH OF ANYONE WHO DESPITE THE FOR KOBE ARMY TICKETS COUNTY AS ECHO WITHOUT TO ASK ME SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE ACT SAYS MORE TALLY- WHICH IS THE DEATH RATE BEYOND WHAT WE EXPECT FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR IS MUCH HIGHER ACTUALLY THE NUMBER OF POLICIES WE HAVE. FOR THE NINETEENTH WE TRY UNDER COUNTY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING OF IT BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE RELATED TO. FIRST OF ALL FOR HUMAN FROM WEST I. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT USE. HAD NO. LOT SO THAT'S EIGHT. ARE YOU USING YOUR AND CAPACITY THE SO I MEAN YOU'RE NOT. AT THE EDGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW BACKLOG BUT CAN USE TO IT DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO OR NOT USING IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ARE ABLE TO GET SAN TO YOU. AND IS- AND WHAT'S THE FASTEST YOU CAN TURN AROUND THE TEST RESULTS GIVEN THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG YOU MENTIONED ONE TO TWO DAYS- IS THE WHAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM DOING IT EVEN FASTER THAN THAT. SO DO YOU SPEAK TO THIS PARTICULAR ASK QUESTIONS. YES SIR- WE WILL IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE WE HAVE HAD SPARE CAPACITY AT QUEST SO LIKE DOCTOR GERDES IS REFERRING TO HIS LABS. WE COULD BE DOING AND- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TESTING OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT TIMING. IT IS A QUESTION OF WHERE THIS WAY WHEN YOU START THE STOPWATCH- IF YOU START THE STOPWATCH THE- YOU KNOW IT EIGHT AM LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE AND WE GET IT INTO THE LAB- BY. MID DAY WE CAN GET YOU THAT RESULT THAT EVENING- BUT A LOT ABOUT SAMPLES IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE SAMPLES FROM RURAL CALIFORNIA- INTO THE INTO THE LAB. OKAY AND SO WHEN YOU SAY EXCESS CAPACITY IN TERMS OF SO HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE YOU WE HEARD FROM USE THAT ARE YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR MAY BE DOING AL HACER LO MORE HALF. WHERE WHERE ARE YOU IN TERMS YOUR ACTUAL CAPACITY IN TERMS OF ACTUAL SAMPLES YOU'RE GETTING ARE YOU. LIKE 20% ACCESS SPECIFIED PERCENT EXCESS CAPACITY YEAH THE REST ESTIMATE YET SO IT CHANGES CONSTANTLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- BUT LOST. THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE'VE BEEN RUNNING. PROBABLY 25% BELOW OUR CAPACITY. OKAY SO. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY YOU CAN DO A LOT MORE WE JUST NEED TO GET. PEOPLE THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE RIGHT THE ISSUE. AND THEN ACTOR TO YES FOR YOU SEE AS YOU ALSO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND YOU SAID YOU REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE GREATEST BARRIER TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE TESTING SINCE YOU HAVE THIS CAPACITY YOUR LATITUDE SO. I GUESS IT IS A QUESTION FOR BOTH QUESTION FOR UC DAVIS IS IT THE DOCTOR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN ONLY DO TEST FROM CERTAIN PLACES BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET PAID FOR THEM. ARE THERE IS THAT- THAT PEOPLE JUST ARSENIO LAST- WHAT WHAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO DO MORE TESTING. YOU HAVE ACCESS. SO WHAT CAN I. YEAH THERE IS A GREAT QUESTION. YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST NOT. ISSUE OKAY- FOR US- YOU KNOW. WE'VE STREAMLINED AND I THINK THE CMS REIMBURSEMENT RATE. IN MY MIND. FOR THE- PC OUR **** VERY GOOD. AND ALLOWS US TO BALANCE THE NATURALLY DO SOME WORK WHERE ARE THEIR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WERE REIMBURSED IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM. WE WOULD YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'D BE RELEVANT YOUR QUESTION WE SCREENED FOURTEEN HUNDRED HEALTHCARE WORKERS AT UCSD AND FOUND ONE POSITIVE. WE WENT OUT TO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHERE WE ACTIVELY SOLICITED HELP. AND WE FOUND ABOUT A 40% POSITIVITY RATE IN THE IN THE PEOPLE WERE LIVING THERE. AND SIX EMPLOYEES WHO WERE TESTED POSITIVE IT AND NO SIGNS OF THE ILLNESS SO WE GOT TO GET THE HOT SPOT IS THE UNIVERSITY I DON'T HAVE THE STAFF. INVOLVED IN OUT REACH IN MARKET EIGHT WITH DOING THE BEST WE CAN. BUT IT'S LIKE THE OLD MOVIE BUILD IT AND THEY WILL CALM I THINK A LOT OF US HAD THAT IDEA THAT THERE'S SUCH A NEED FOR TASTIC. ALL WE NEEDED TO DO WAS PRESENT OURSELVES AND SAY WE HERE WE HAVE THIS CAPACITY YOU PEOPLE WOULD REACH OUT. CONTRARY HAVE TO AGGRESSIVELY AND IT TAKES STAFF AND ARE WE PEOPLE AND WE DO IN THE BEST WE CAN WITH. WHAT WE HAVE AND UNIVERSITIES TO DO THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME CAPACITY LIKE A COMPANY LIKE QUEST YOU THAT KIND OF THING. BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK TO THE STATE. THE TASK FORCE AND OTHERS. TO DEVELOP PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN PARTICIPATE AND USE OUR ASSETS. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IN STATE TASK FORCE SORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE ARE THERE I MEAN WE'RE THE COLLABORATION THERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THIS TESTING CAPACITY. OKAY WE HAVE A DOCTOR I'M SORRY MS SAUCY AND THEN- WE'LL GO TO DOCTOR WHO THE GREAT A COUPLE HANDS UP THERE. IF THERE'S TWO SIDES OF TESTING MEMBERS OF THE SAMPLE COLLECTION RIGHT AND THERE'S THE PROCESSING OF THE SAMPLE AND SO THE CAPACITY AND PROCESSING EXAMPLE THE LABS HAS GROWN AND IT IS VERY MUCH AVAILABLE RIGHT- SWAPS HAVE BEEN- DIFFICULT TO COME BY AS WELL AS FIRE MEDIA AND THEN IT'S AN ISSUE OF STAFFING WHICH GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ADEQUATE PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING IN PLACE READY FOR THESE KINDS OF EVENTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON THE GROUND AND THERE SOME COLLABORATIONS THAT WE DO. BUT FOR THE MOST PART WHEN IT COMES THESE TECHNICAL KINDS OF THINGS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH STOCK. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU AND I THINK A WILL GO TO DOCTOR WHO AND THEN DOCTOR DEAN. THERE WAS JUST A- MEMBER THAT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE SURGE PROTECTION WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. PAGE A BIG BOULDER SELF. ARE GONNA BE INFECTED AND THAT WAS OUR HOSPITALS PRIORITY IS TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN IT CAN HANDLE ARE THE CRITICAL CARE NEEDS OF NOT ONLY OUR PATIENTS NOT ONLY. IN PATIENTS AND- OUTPATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS. NOW THAT IT LOOKS LIKE- WE ARE ABLE TO HANDLE IT I THINK WE SHOULD EXPAND ON OUR SERVICES. BUT STILL NUMBER ONE IN MY PRIORITY IS MY PATIENCE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN TESTING EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN THE DOOR YET. THAT'S OUR NEXT MISSION I AM NOT LOOKING TO- TO HELP- EVERYBODY ELSE'S ISSUE WHEN I CAN'T EVEN FIND AT. IT'S ALWAYS A BY THE WAY YOU SAID YOU CAN'T TEST OCCUPATION SO WE HAVE ALL THIS CAPACITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN YOUR YOU SEE SO WHAT'S GOING ON. SENATOR OUT IF WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST FINISH UP THAT QUESTION WE HAVE ABOUT- FOR OTHER SENATORS AND WE HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT LINE WAITING AS WELL SO- DOCTOR WILL IF YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. YEAH I MEAN IT IT'S ALL ABOUT- ARE SLOBS AND SUPPLIES AND THAT. WE CAN ONLY DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN IT WAS LITERALLY ONLY JUST THIS WEEK THAT WE GOT A SUPPLY OF BOB- ADDED ID NOW KIDS AND IN THE END IN THE PASSAGE SO PUTTING TOGETHER. OUR KIDS WE'VE HAD FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THEY HAD A LOT CURRENT PRIME BUT THAT IS RESOLVING AND SO WE ARE ABLE TO WELL. YOU TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS ABSOLUTELY LET LITERALLY AS OF THIS WEEK. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WILL- I THINK SENATOR PENN DOES THAT CONCLUDE. YOUR QUESTIONS. AT E. S. I SEE CHARITY DANGER I KNOW SHE WANTS TO MAKE A FINAL COMMENT. ABSOLUTELY DR DEAN. ON FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENORMOUS EXPERTISE THAT DOCTOR GUNN USE HAS. HELPED ADVISE THE TESTING TASK FORCE TO LOOKING AT DIFFERENT TESTING MODALITIES AND STRATEGIES ON. EVERYTHING THAT WAS JUST SHARED BY THE UC SYSTEM AND BY QUEST IS REALLY% IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAPACITY AND WE KNOW THAT AND WHAT WHAT WE ARE STRIVING TO DO IS TO LINK UP THE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES WITH THOSE LABS THAT HAVE CAPACITY IN AS WE SPEAK WITH THE RURAL COUNTIES WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RURAL COUNTIES TODAY. WE ARE WANTING TO LINK THEM UP WITH THOSE HAVE LABS THE UC LABS I'M TALKING ABOUT IF THEY HAVE A- CONTRACTOR IF THEY'RE CLINICS HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PRIVATE LABS HIS THERE'S ADDED CAPACITY THERE SO THERE THERE ARE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE NOT BEING FULLY USE. ON I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PART OF THE ISSUE HAS BEEN LACK OF SWAPS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE AS A STATE- ARE. WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BEEN A FEW WEEKS HERE BY NEXT WEEK WILL HAVE- ENOUGH SWAP TO TURN AROUND AND SEND OUT TO THE COUNTY SO THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR BOTTLENECK. BUT WE ABSOLUTELY ARE LIKE WHAT WE CALL A MAP MAKER MODEL WORK NOW KING THE SPECIMENS BEING COLLECT ACTUALLY IN ALL OF. HOW CAN. YOU THERE ARE PRIVATE OR WHEN THE SEA LAB I KNOW DR GHANI AND I. DID ON EACH END THAT ONE TO SENDS BEST. SO THAT THEY CAN SEE ABSOLUTELY CAPACITY. IT SHOULD. STOP GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DOG DEAN EN WE WILL. GO ON TO OUR NEXT SENATOR FOR IN QUESTION SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO IF I IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY WE NOW HAVE A GREATER CAPACITY TO ANALYZE THESE OF A TEST SO AS A RESULT THE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LABS. GOING ONLINE IF YOU WILL THE PROBLEM IS BEEN SWAPS AND THEN THE RE AGENTS AND WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THAT ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO UNITE TO BE ABLE TO. TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF. OF THE LABS TO DO THE TESTING WITH THESE FREE AGENTS AND SWAPS NOW BEING AVAILABLE I'M WONDERING NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO GET A SEARCH AND- I'M A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD ARE WE PLANNING TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE I'M BOTH THE. THE FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE TAKE THE TO THIS AND DO THAT WERE. ALONG WITH THE LAB SO ARE THEY GOING TO BE ON LINE CONSISTENTLY SO THAT IF WE SEE A SURGE COMING IN WHETHER IT'S THE SUMMER. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN. GOING THIS PHASE TWO OR THREE YEARS WHO KNOWS WHAT- AND THEN IN THE FALL WHEN WE START SEEING MORE THE FLUID SPECTRUM. ARE WE GOING TO BE PREPARED ARE WE GOING TO GO TO THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN OF THE LACK OF SWAMPED I MEAN HE'S JUST BEEN Q. TIPS. THE NOTION OF. WE DON'T HAVE THEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IS JUST. MIND BOGGLING. ON THE IT HAS BEEN A SORT OF A HURDLE FOR US IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. BUT ARE WE ANTICIPATING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE. ARE OUR LABS AVAILABLE IN THE MATERIAL AVAILABLE ARE WE WATER PAYING THESE PRIVATE WHAT. ARE THEY- THEY GETTING BURST THROUGH MEDI CAL US SO THAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE THEY'LL STILL BE WITH. I IF THE SIR. GREED COMES OR IS GOING TO BE MONEY OF THE OUT OF GENERAL FUND. HOW IS THIS ALL GOING TO WORK AS AS WE GO FOR IT IN AND HAVE AN EXPECTED SURGE SOME POINT IN TIME. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. HER RIGHT ARM. COULD WE ARE HERE TO TAKE THIS QUESTION THERE WERE- I'LL THERE WAS A LOT TO UNPACK THEIR RELATIVE TO- FUTURE MANAGEMENT AND WE'LL START WITH DOCTOR WHO WILL. REGISTER JUST QUICK COMMENT THESE ARE JUST A FEW TIPS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR BATHROOM THESE ARE SPECIALLY DESIGNED- TIPS THAT ARE ARE PARTICULAR PURPOSE TO TRACK VIRUSES ARE NOT KILL THEM ALL FOR WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TEST THEM IN FACT THE ABIT ID NOW HAS OLD SPECIAL Q. TIPS THAT CAN BE USED WITH ANY OTHER DEVICE CAN USE ONCE YOU. COULD USE FOR ANOTHER SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT IT IS STILL MAINTAINS TO BE A SURPRISE. BUT TWO YEARS QUESTION YEAH I'M- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE TO SET ASIDE. RESOURCES AND SUPPLIES SHOULD A SECOND WAVE COME EVEN IF IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO. A DESIRE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE IMPACTED. THANK YOU DOCTOR WILL IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATE. OKAY I THINK DOCTOR DAVIS. SIR WE CANNOT HEAR YOU WILL GO AHEAD AND ON MUTE YOU IN JUST A MOMENT. THERE YOU ARE. YEAH RIGHT NOW YES WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT I DO UNDERSTAND AT LEAST AT THE MOMENT- THAT THE MAJORITY OF PLANS ARE COVERING THAT- SO THERE IS THERE IS REIMBURSEMENT FAIRLY FOR THE MEDIC HOW PLANT. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT BUT THE ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY. AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE SERVING A POPULATION OF THAT WE ARE SEEING THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES THAN ARE ALSO MISSING THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. IT'S NOT AS IF THE SAMPLE EVEN IF THEY WERE GONNA COLLECTED IN OUR OFFICE. AND JUST BE DONE WITH WITH NOTHING. ARE THERE IS GUIDANCE SPECIFICALLY FROM THE CDC IN RELATIONSHIP TO THAT- BUT THEY DO OFFER HERE AT THE SAME. ISSUE BOB NOT BEING AVAILABLE AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT'S YOU TO. COLLECT IN THE APPLE DOT. THANK YOU DOCTOR DAVIS. AND SENATOR JACKSON. I THINK WELL I DO HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THAN THAN THAT IT HAS TO DEAL WITH THE- I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS AN OPINION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S EMERGING NOW IS DOING. WASTE WATER- AND- TRACING AND WHETHER THAT WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE. WAY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CASTING. A CRISIS TO DEAL WITH THIS WELL I WONDER IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD JUST. THE BUNK WHETHER IT HAS SOME VALIDITY WHAT THE EXPERTS SEEM TO THINK AS FAR AS- USING. ME ALSO SO WASTE WATER IS A TOOL FOR- TRYING TO FIGHT THE VIRUS IN INSIDE CONTINUED INFECTING OF COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. OKAY LET'S SEE WHO WE HAVE HERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY HANDS UP BUT IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO TAKE THAT ON AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND TERMS OF WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT. ALL RIGHTS WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE. PERHAPS WILL PUT A PIN IN THAT AND THEN COME BACK TO THAT IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS AT THE END BUT WE WILL MOVE FORWARD. TO SENATOR MCGUIRE. I THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR ALL HOLD MY QUESTION I KNOW THAT WE'RE GETTING LATE. WE HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS ALL HOLD MY QUESTION INGESTING THE DECKS YOU THAT'S ALRIGHT READING.

BRIEFLY ON. CAN WE BE RUNNING A LEADING FROM ALL THE OTHER BODIES I DO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A VACCINATION IN THE FUTURE. DOCTOR WILL AS I CAN'T I CAN'T COMMENT ON WHERE VERY ON A VACCINE THAT SO NOT SOMETHING THAT I PARTICULAR WORKING ON WE ARE WORKING ON THAT IT YOU SEE US OUT. WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS TO IDENTIFY A NEXT GENERATION- ANTIBODY TESTS THAT CAN BE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED. OUT SO WE SORT OF GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE- THE FDA. DID NOT VET THESE TESTS IN THE IN HOPES OF GETTING IT OUT THERE AND I SOON SUPPORTED THAT. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION A LOT OF STEVEN HAVE THESE TESTS TODAY BECAUSE NORMALLY WOULD TAKE ONE TO TWO YEARS. THEY GET ANY THESE OUT HERE AND SO THEY SORT. OF HIS PURPOSE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY TIME NOW TO. LOOK AT A SECOND GENERATION THIS IS MY OPINION. THANK YOU BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE DOUBTS THAT OF ME THANKS AGAIN. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR BATES AND DOCTOR WILL ALRIGHT- THIS CONCLUDES OUR QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS AT THIS TIME SO WE WILL- MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I JUST WANT TO.
