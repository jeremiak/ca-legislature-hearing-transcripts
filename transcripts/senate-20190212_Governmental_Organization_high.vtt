00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.720
AND THEN OF COURSE IN NINETEEN

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:14.954
NINETEEN WE HAVE --

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.757

EFFORTS --

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.268
AND AS WE KNOW FROM THE HISTORY

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.803
OF AL CAPONE AND OTHERS AND

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.804
THERE'S A GUN THERE WHICH IS

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.172
KIND OF HARD TO SEE NEXT OF

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.507
THOSE CARDS --

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.376
IT ALSO LED TO IT UNFORTUNATELY

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.644
LED TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRIME

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.245
THERE WERE ACTUALLY BENEFITS

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.013
FROM IT --

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.714
CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER FOR

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.117
EXAMPLE WENT WAY DOWN BUT PEOPLE

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:48.254
OF COURSE STILL DRINK --

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:48.821
AND INSTEAD OF DRINKING IN A

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:53.526
LEGAL WAY SELECTIVITY WHICH IN

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.560
NINETEEN THIRTY THREE LED TO THE

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.995
REPEAL OF PROHIBITION --

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.497
AND ONE OF THE UNUSUAL THINGS

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.465
THAT HAPPEN IN THE REPEAL WAS

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.868
THAT THE STATE'S WERE GIVEN THE

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.703
RIGHT TO REGULATE ALCOHOL.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.239
UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT IN THE

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.008
UNITED STATES SO TIME IS WALLS

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:10.209

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.111
THOSE OF US WHO ARE HAVE LAW

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.080
SCHOOL INFLICTED ON THEM --

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.948
GENERALLY COMMERCE AND OTHER

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.517
THING SHOULD FLOOR ACROSS STATE

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.085
LINES WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.820
WILL ONE DAY --

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.355
PRODUCT REALLY EXEMPTED FROM

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.890
THAT IS ALCOHOL AND THAT'S BY

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.158
THE TWENTY FIRST AMENDMENT SO

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.927

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.095
BACON ABOUT CALL THAT IS

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.764
REGULATED VERY STRICTLY THEY CAN

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.499
DICTATE IS SOME STATES HAVE IN

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.101
THE PAST THAT THERE BE NO BEER

2% ALCOHOL IT CETERA.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.241
SO IT'S AN IT'S AN UNUSUAL

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.943
REGULATORY SCHEME.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.877
I WON THAT EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:45.945
COMPLEXITY OF THE LAWS IN

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.013

JOBS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.854
AND THEY TEND TO BE PRETTY GOOD

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.524
JOBS -- IT

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.925
IS A IT IS AN INDUSTRY VIRTUALLY

WE LICENSE ALL CURRENT YES

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.106
CHAIRMAN. TO ASK FOR QUESTIONS

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.774
HE'LL.

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:02.375
I BOUGHT WAS A SEEING THOSE

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:04.610
NUMBERS BEFORE BUT I NEVER SEE A

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.279
NUMBER RELATED.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.179
TO HARD.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.348
ALCOHOL IN TERMS OF DOLLAR

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:11.250
ECONOMIC VALUE WHAT THE HOW MUCH

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.785
OF THAT IS SOLD IN THE STATE OF

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:14.153
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ANY.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.955
INFORMATION ON THAT I I DON'T

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.857
KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY DO --

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.692
WE MIGHT --

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.727
NOT NO NOTHING FROM THE PEANUT

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.062
GALLERY --

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:25.598
THE WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS AND

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.465
WE AND WE CAN WE'RE GONNA TALK

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.301
ABOUT THIS I THINK A LITTLE BIT

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.670
BUT IN TERMS OF RESTAURANTS --

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.305
HARD ALCOHOL IS BECOMING

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.006
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.908
BUSINESS MODELS AND I'M IN IT'S

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:37.410
AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT WE'RE

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.511
DEALING WITH BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:39.979
LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.847
BUSINESSES THAT CAN SELL OUR OUR

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.450
ALCOHOL.

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.652
I'M IN PARTLY BY THE WAY.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:47.620
TAKE IT BACK PROHIBITION PARTLY

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:48.688
THE REASON WAS IS THAT.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.222
IT WAS IT'S IT'S IT'S FAR MORE

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:52.525
INTOXICATING BY VOLUME SO

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.226
GENERALLY THERE'S BEEN A BELIEF

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.728
THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE CLOSELY

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.697
REGULATED AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.131
THAT IS A PATTERN THAT.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:00.466
THAT THAT --

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.735
FLOWS THROUGH ALL STATES --

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.737
REGULATORY SYSTEMS --

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:08.341
WHETHER THAT SOMETHING THAT IS --

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:11.310
APPROPRIATE ANYMORE IS XIN WORTH

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.145
ASKING BUT GENERALLY IT'S BEEN

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.613
THE VIEW THAT IT IS A IT'S A

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.782
MORE DANGEROUS PRODUCT JUST

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:19.185
BECAUSE OF ITS ALCOHOL CONTENT --

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.253
WE LICENSE ALL SORTS OF THINGS

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.658
FROM AIRPLANES TWO SHIPS ARE WE

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.007
KINDS OF LICENSES I MEAN THEY

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.175
HAVE SOME COMMONALITIES TO THEM.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.643

THERE CERTAIN ESSENTIALLY

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:53.386

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.574
SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES HOLD A

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.043
COUPLE LICENSES IN COMBINATION

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:18.110
SO THEY CAN DO A FEW DIFFERENT

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.478
THINGS --

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:21.113

RENEW IT'S JUST AN AUTOMATIC

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.068
PROCESS --

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:42.902
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.737

RETAIL OPERATIONS SO THAT'S WHY

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.900
YOU CAN GO INTO A WINERY IN YOU

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:15.868

BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE VERY

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.776
COMPLEX LOCAL PROCESSES.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:00.246
AND THERE ARE THERE ARE TEND TO

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.014
BE A LOT OF PROTESTS PARTLY

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:04.016
BECAUSE THE COMPACTION OF IT

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.852

00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:59.551
SACRAMENTO WHERE I LIVE I DON'T

CONSIDER TO BE A CRIME

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.454
INVESTIGATION MANY BETTER RULE

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:03.889
READS THAT WAY.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.525
AND IF THAT IS TRUE THEN THERE

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:10.596
NEEDS TO BE CITY. TO JUSTIFY THE

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.731
ISSUANCE OF A LICENSE AND THERE

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.266
ALSO NEEDS TO THERE ALSO IS A

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.401
PRESUMPTION THAT WOULD THEY HAVE

DO.

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.115
BUT AGAIN WE REALLY TRY TO WORK

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:33.385
WITH APPLICANTS --

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.487
TO BRING THEIR APPLICATION

FORWARD IN A WAY THAT IT WAS ME

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:38.257
IT'S MOST LIKELY TO BE GRANTED

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.092
IF IT'S IN FACT SOMETHING THAT

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.194
CAN FIT WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITY.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.796
THAT'S INTERESTING PHRASES BEEN

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:47.800
DESCRIBED IS ESSENTIALLY

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:48.066
FOOTLOOSE.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.135
THERE'S CATEGORICAL DENIALS AND

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.070
THE BURDEN OF PERSUASION --

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.639
TO TO SHOWN NECESSITY OR

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.641
JUSTIFICATION OF SOME KIND MADE

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.342
IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND JUST

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:58.877
KIND OF SAID I DIDN'T KNOW THE

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.446
NEXUS BETWEEN A. B. C. THE STATE

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:01.747
AND AND THERE'S AND THERE'S DIED

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:02.881
NOT TO GET TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.450
BUT FRESNO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE IN.

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:05.517
OTHERS PARTS OF FRIENDS NUMBER

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.618
PEOPLE BEEN REALLY CONCERNED

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.387
ABOUT LIQUOR STORES AND SO THERE

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:09.588
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PUBLIC

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.156

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:19.465
GOOD THING FOR THOSE

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.632
NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE ACTUALLY

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.100
BRING JOBS IN THEM AND SOME

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.102
OTHER LIFE THAN A PERSON WHO

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:27.072

PRACTICAL AS REGULATORS.

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:13.999

RISE OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN

THE IN THE POPULARITY AND

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.113
ACCESSIBILITY IS THERE ANYTHING

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.181
THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IN

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.816
TERMS OF MONITORING.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.351
HOW THESE TWO INDUSTRIES MAKE

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:41.820
CROSSOVER?

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:42.687
WE ARE MONITORING THAT REALLY

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:43.354
CLOSELY --

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.623
OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO MAKE PEOPLE

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.459
UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:48.326
LEGAL.

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:52.430
NAY SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED IN.

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.032
ON ALCOHOL ESTABLISHMENT --

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:55.733
OR SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED WITH

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.669
ALCOHOL IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE

00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:59.070
THE TWO OF MY HOME AND THEY CAN

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.106
DO IT UP THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THEY

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.674
CAN DO THAT IF THEY WANT TO BUT

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.842
WITH THE LEADS THOSE THOSE

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.510
STATUTORY SCHEME IS REALLY CLEAR

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.078
THAT THEY NEED TO BE SEPARATED.

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:09.614
SO WE HAVE SENT OUT ADVISORIES

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:11.716
WE'VE SENT WARNINGS TO LICENSEES

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:14.085
OF OURS WHO REALLY SEEM TO WANT

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.386
TO COMBINE THE TWO PRODUCTS THAT

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:17.322
I MEAN IN A VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:18.990
WAY I DON'T THINK THERE ARE YOU

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.358
KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO BE --

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.293
CROOKS OR ANYTHING BUT WE'RE

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.429
JUST REALLY --

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:25.964
THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.398
TO GET AWAY FROM US AND AND IN

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.667
INDUSTRY TO ADD TO RISE UP THOSE

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:30.201
ESSENTIALLY COMBINING THE

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.402
PRODUCTS.

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.204
UNLESS OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:35.140
DECIDES THAT'S OKAY FOR RIGHT

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:37.308
NOW WILL THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.543
KEEP THEM SEPARATE.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.211
SO WE OF BEEN REALLY WORKING

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.280
HARD TO KEEP OUR LICENSEES OUT

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:44.115
OF TROUBLE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.317
TO MAKE COCKTAILS WITH CANNABIS

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:47.018
AND THEM AND ANALYZE ONLY

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.987
BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR AM IN

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:51.422
CERTAIN CITIES ARE.

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:56.027
THAT'S CORRECT. FIVE TO MISTER

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:57.762
CHAIRMAN BACK.

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:58.897
ON HAT YEAH SO --

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.632
AS ONE OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:03.568
LEGISLATORS I I THINK THAT THIS

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:04.369
SHARP.

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:05.003
LIKE.

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.372
THE TO SHALL NOT EVER MEET I

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:09.240
THINK IT IS NOT A CRITICISM A.

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.909
B. C. IT'S THE LAW IS THE LAW

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.277
AND I HOPE WE CHANGE OUR ITS

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.878
IRRATIONAL --

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.547
AYE AYE AND THERE WAS A BILL I

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:16.648
THINK LAST YEAR I DON'T REMEMBER

00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:17.849
THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT I VOTED

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:18.816
AGAINST.

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:19.617
TO THE YOU CAN EVEN CHOOSE

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:22.020
ALCOHOL WITH WITH ANYTHING FROM

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:22.820
CANNABIS EVEN IF HAS NOTHING TO

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:24.956
DO WITH INTOXICATION WE ARE --

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.691
ABSOLUTELY STIFLING INNOVATION

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:27.525
AND THEN THE IDEA THE IN TERMS

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:28.326
OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.661
CONSUME CANNABIS WE DON'T WANT

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:32.063
THEM DOING ON THE STREET --

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.998
YOU HAVE YOUR PEOPLE.

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:39.704
YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:42.340
THE OLD PEOPLE SMOKING.

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.975
AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:46.344
PROVIDE THAT IT CAN BE DONE I I

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:47.579
THINK A SAFE.

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:48.379
WAY -- SO I

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.248
HOPE WE MOVE AWAY FROM THE SHARP

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:52.450
CANNABIS IS YOUR ALCOHOL IS HERE

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.886
AND THE WORLD WILL AND IF THEY

00:30:54.953 --> 00:31:00.658
COME TOGETHER --

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:02.994
AND JUST A REAL QUICK REFERENCE --

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:04.095
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.396
UNUSUAL --

00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:06.764
DISCIPLINARY --

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:08.766
SYSTEM -- SO

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:10.602
THIS IS FOR IF WE TAKE ACTION

00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:12.237
AGAINST A LICENSE OR LICENSES

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:13.371
TONIGHT -- I

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.240
HAVE MY OWN PROSECUTORS AT MY

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:16.841
OWN JUDGES AND ACTUALLY MAKE ALL

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.943
THE DECISIONS MYSELF SO.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.812
I IT'S OF IT'S VERY MUCH OF A

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.780
PERSONAL ATTENTION TO DETAIL

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.716
THAT I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:27.352
ALL OF THESE THINGS --

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:29.654
AND SO MY MAKE A LOT.

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.422
COUPLE HUNDRED DECISIONS BASED

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:33.558
ON JUDGES ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.460
ME EVERY YEAR --

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:36.094
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE AN

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.033
APPEAL TO AN APPEALS BOARD --

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.134
LET ME SEE SAY SOMETHING A

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.369
LITTLE BIT ROB REGULATION THIS

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.404
IS SORT OF A SEGUE INTO TIGHT

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:46.638
HOUSE.

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:49.407
GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE THINK

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.875
ALCOHOL S REGULATED IN THE

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.277
RIGHT WAY IF YOU TAKE A POLL

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:54.045
FROM -- I

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:55.680
THINK THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.048
PRODUCT THAT HAS SOCIETAL

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:00.652
PROBLEMS IF IF LEFT UNFETTERED --

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:01.886
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEIR

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.855
CONCERNS ARE DRUNK DRIVING AN

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:05.523
UNDERAGE DRINKING RIGHT UP THERE

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.591
AT THE TOP.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:07.892
THERE A LITTLE LESS CONCERN

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.627
INTERESTINGLY ABOUT LOWERING

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:11.629
PRICES WHICH IS GENERALLY THE

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:16.434
HUGE IN THE ARGUMENTS YOU HERE --

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:19.137
FOR FOR DEREGULATING PRODUCTS --

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:21.105
AND THE INDUSTRY ITSELF VERY

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:23.941
MUCH SUPPORTS OUR DEPARTMENTS --

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:26.177
AND REGULATION AND WHY BECAUSE

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:29.514
IT'S IS A IS A QUOTE ON QUOTE

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.482
SAN INDUSTRY RIGHT.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:32.550
BAD STORIES.

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.052
ARE THEY'RE THE ONES WE'RE GONNA

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.286
GET PICKED ON FIRST THERE'S

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.521
NOTHING THEY FEAR MORE THAN

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:39.724
TAXATION REALLY OR UNDUE

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.025
REGULATION --

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.160
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.861
PRODUCT THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.897
BEEN SOMETHING THAT WHEN THINGS

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.498
GO BAD.

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:49.867
SOMEONE WANTS TO REGULATE THEM

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:51.736
OR TAX THEM --

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.771
AND THEY'RE ALSO GENERALLY A LOT

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:56.107
OF THEM SPECIALLY MID TO SMALL

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.909
BUSINESSES.

00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:59.977
REGULATION IS IS FOR THEM A

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:02.547
GUARD AGAINST UNFAIR COMPETITION.

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:03.247
THE DIRECTOR I JUST WANTED TO

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.917
MAKE A POINT THAT.

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.920
I DIDN'T WANT ANY THE NEW

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:11.889
A. B. C. REGULATES MARIJUANA --

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.591
YEAH WHILE I HOPE TO THE

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.726
DEPARTMENT OF BEER OF KICK

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.561
CANNABIS CONTROL REGULATES

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:17.895
MARIJUANA --

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.831
IS EFFECTIVELY AS THE A. B. C.

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:21.466
DOES --

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:24.102
ALCOHOL.

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:24.602
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:28.239
DEPARTMENT.

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.174
I GERMAN PLEASE AT NIGHT

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:31.242
RECOGNIZED OUT BUT DOT COMING

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:32.510
FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.578
HAD ISSUED PERMITS THERE'S

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.847
ALWAYS THE THE BAD ACTOR AND THE

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:36.481
AND THE POOL OF PEOPLE THAT WANT

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.081
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT THE

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:37.849
RIGHT TIME AND SO WE'VE

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.016
EXPERIENCED SOME.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:40.284
SOME ISSUES SO I WAS JUST

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:41.753
WONDERING IF YOU HAD COME ACROSS

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:42.787
ANYTHING THAT.

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.123
KIND OF LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:48.059
WE NEED TO BE LIKE MARK AND THE

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.060
ONLY THING AND ADD TO THAT IS.

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.795
THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AROUND

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.530
THIS ISSUE PARDON THE PUN --

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.732
WE'VE FOUND VERY LITTLE ACTUAL

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.602
CROSSOVER IT'S BEEN MOSTLY.

00:33:57.668 --> 00:33:59.704
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT AN ARTICLE

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.874
SPRING UP ABOUT IT --

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.609
SO HERE AGAIN SO NOW WHAT'S THE

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.843
DATE BACK TO THE TIED HOUSE --

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.246
IN AGAIN A TIGHT HOUSE MEANS A

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:09.847
MANUFACTURER.

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.783
AND THE HOUSE THAT SELLS ALCOHOL

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.217
ARE TIED TOGETHER --

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.619
INCLUDED IN THIS --

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:18.790
SYSTEM IS A* WHOLESALERS SO

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.057
IMPURE TIGHT HOUSE SYSTEM.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:21.692
NO MANUFACTURER WHOLESALER

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.594
RETAILER CAN HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:28.332
OR CONTROL OVER ANY OTHER TEAR.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.700
AND THE IDEAS THIS CREATES

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:31.469
ORDERLY DISTRIBUTION AT PRESENT

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.504
IT PREVENTS ACCESS.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:37.675
SO AGAIN BACK TO THE BACK TO THE

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.010
OLD DAYS --

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.179
IN IN TO ONE OF THE REASONS TIED

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:42.980
HOUSES WERE SO CONCERNING IS

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:43.815
THAT --

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:45.783
THERE WERE FEARS COMPETITIONS

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.652
PARTICULAR MUNK BREWERIES --

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:49.287
AND THEY ESSENTIALLY WOULD PUT

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:51.155
SALOONS OR OR BARS AND TO

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.623
BUSINESS --

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.193
AND THEY WOULD SOMETIMES BY THE

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.627
EQUIPMENT SOMETIMES BY ALL THE

00:34:56.694 --> 00:35:00.164
GLASSWARE ON BETWEEN NINE AND

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.165
EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE IN NINETEEN

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:01.833
OH FIVE THE SLITS BREWING

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.968
COMPANY FOR THOSE OF US OLD

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:07.672
ENOUGH TO REMEMBER SCHLITZ BEER --

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:10.541
THEY IN DISTRICT ONE NEIGHBOR

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.143
SAYS I'M IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.111
THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.880
FOR EVERY BAR --

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.648
THEY USE FREE LUNCHES

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.851
PROSTITUTION GAMBLING ANYTHING

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.486
THEY COULD TO COMPETE WITH EACH

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:22.153
OTHER.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.157
AND TO TO SELL ALCOHOL A LOT OF

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.225
TIMES SOME OF THESE COMPANIES

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.192
WERE WERE --

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.228
FOREIGN OWNED OR NOT LOCALLY

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.162
OWNED.

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:32.864
THEY DIDN'T REALLY GIVE MUCH

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.832
CARE ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.702
THEY JUST HAD A PROFIT MOTIVE

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.837
AND THAT PROFIT MOTIVE WAS WAS

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.472
TO SELL ALCOHOL AS MUCH AS THEY

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.241
COULD AND TO ELIMINATE THEIR

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:44.108
COMPETITORS.

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:45.276
SO WHEN --

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:47.578
PROHIBITION CAME OUT --

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.146
WHO'S VIEWED AS HAVING GONE TOO

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.681
FAR -- THAT

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:52.149
IT WAS WITH A REALLY NOT GOING

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:53.784
TO CHANGE TEN THOUSAND YEARS OF

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.720
HUMAN HISTORY --

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.122
THE STATE'S WERE ALLOWED TO

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:00.825
REGULATE AS I SAID BEFORE.

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.727
SO -- IN

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:03.794
SOME STATES ARE COTROL STATES

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.795
MEAN THEY ACTUALLY RUN THE

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.631
LIQUOR STORES SOME OF A MORON

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.499

BOWL JUST DEPENDS THERE'S ALL

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.537
SORTS OF MODELS --

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:14.639
CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO NOT BE IN

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.674
THE ALCOHOL BUSINESS BUT IT

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:17.875

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.111
REGULATIONS AND ARE STRICT TIED

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:22.980

HE WOULD LET ME BRING UP THE DID

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.453

TIGHT HOUSE ROOM RULES.

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.294
WORD ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN WORDS

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.162
LONG WHICH SAID IF YOU'RE A

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:39.397
RETAILER YOU CAN'T BE A

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.332

WHOLESALER ETCETERA.

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:46.003
SO IT'S JUST ONE TINY LITTLE

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:51.242
PROVISIONING HERE AND THIS IS MY

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.109
ACT TODAY --

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.411
AND IT IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:53.911
PAGES LONG.

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:56.247
SO IT IS ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED --

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:59.083
LEE REGULAR WHO WE SHE'S THE

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.285
HEAD OF OUR TRADING FORCED ME

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:01.852
UNIT WHICH DEALS WITH TIGHT

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:02.920

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:06.924
YOU KNOW --

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.893
ALFIE KISS AND AND KNOWLEDGE OF

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.462
ALL THINGS AND COMPUTER IN THIS --

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.831
BUT IT'S HARD TO FALL I MEAN IS

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.499
THERE SOME BASIC THINGS ARE

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.400
CLEAR.

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:17.902
BUT THERE'S SOME OBSCURE THINGS

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.670
THE TRIP UP VERY SOPHISTICATED

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:20.771
PEOPLE.

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:22.039
AND THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.841
GOOD THING BUT BUT WE'VE CREATED

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:26.477
EXCEPTIONS OVER THE YEARS AND

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:27.979
VERY UNUSUAL SEARCHERS

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.647
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE.

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:32.283
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.151
FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF LAWS

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.253
REGULATIONS.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.488
OF SERVER NOT NINE NINE THIS BUT

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:38.155
I'M I MEAN TO THIS COMMITTEE --

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.458
WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT ALLOWS A --

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:43.227
LIKE A BREWERY TO SELL ALCOHOL

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.629
ON THEIR OWN PREMISES AT A

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.163
COMPETITIVE MICROBREWERY FOR

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.964
EXAMPLE.

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:47.865
SURE SO --

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.700
SO THERE'S THERE'S REALLY TWO

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.936
WAYS SO --

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:54.705
THAT CAN BE A MENU FOR IT'S

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:55.706
BASICALLY A MANUFACTURING

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.608
LICENSE THEY HAVE TO MANUFACTURE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.543
ON THAT PROMISES AND THEN

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.245
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SELL THE BEER

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.613
FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.516
SO THE GOLDEN ROAD NINETEEN TO

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:07.451
AND CON ELSTREE WHICH HAS BEEN

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:08.986
IN THE NEWS --

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.254
THERE ALSO THE AND DOWNTOWN ONLY

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.589
THAT'S OWNED BY ANHEUSER BUSCH

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.157
THEY MAKE BEER THERE AND THEN

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.458
THEY CAN SELL THEIR OWN BEER

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:15.626
THERE --

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.495
THERE'S OTHER ONES THAT ARE ON

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:18.863
LIKE A BREW PUB --

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.431
THEY HAVE TO MANUFACTURE BEER ON

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:21.899
THE PREMISES --

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:22.900

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.136
EXCEPTION TO BE A RETAILER OR

WITHIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.072
LIMITS.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.074
WINERIES HAVEL HAVE MORE

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.942
PRIVILEGES THAN ANY OF THE OTHER

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:34.078
MANUFACTURERS THEY CAN ACTUALLY

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.447
OWN LIQUOR STORES BUT ONLY ONCE

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:38.315
IT'S SELL BEER AND WINE THEY

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:40.551
CAN'T HAVE A LIQUOR STORE THAT --

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.119
CELLS HARD ALCOHOL --

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:43.521
THEY CAN THEN ALSO HAVE A

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.655
RESTAURANT AND IF THEY HAVE A

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.290
RESTAURANT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:48.092
SERVE OTHER PEOPLE'S WINE --

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.795
AS LONG AS IT COMES IN THE

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.229
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.531
AND ARE WE IN USUAL

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.498
INTERNATIONALLY IN THIS I KNOW I

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:55.966
THINK IN THE U. K. FOR EXAMPLE

00:38:56.033 --> 00:39:01.238
YOU HAVE BIG BREWERS WHO WILL.

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:03.741
HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PUBS AND AN

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:04.942
OLD THEN THE BASIC EXCLUSIVELY

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.111
SELL THEIR THEIR BEERS I IS THAT

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.313
CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.715
IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT A COMMON

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.615
MODEL IN EUROPE.

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.452
IT'S A COMMON MODEL IN EUROPE

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:17.088
IT'S COMMON MODEL IN THE WORLD --

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:18.923
MISSION DID NOT WANT.

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.458
SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:24.161
BRAZIL FEARS COPIES.

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:25.496
MANAGER BUSH'S HEADQUARTERED IN

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.230
BRAZIL --

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.165
AND HEINEKEN IS DECIDED THAT IT

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:30.568
WANTS TO EDGE RAN AS A BOOKSHOP

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:32.369
IN BRAZIL SO THE TWO COMPANIES

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:34.105
ARE LITERALLY GOING AROUND AND

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.306
THEY ARE PUTTING.

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:37.975
THEIR PAYING BARS FIFTY THOUSAND

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.210
DOLLARS TO CARRY ONLY THEIR

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:40.478
PRODUCTS WE COULD HAVE TO DO

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:41.512
THIS KIND OF THING SOME COKE AND

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:42.947
PEPSI DO THIS KIND OF THING

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.215
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:44.682
CODE.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:47.051
IF YOU GO TO A BIG SUPERMARKET.

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.552

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:57.294
MANUFACTURERS OF BEER.

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.662
IN.

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.296
AND THIS IS A THIS IS PRIMARILY

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:01.031
A PRO COMPETITION.

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:01.999
THANK ITS IT'S ORIGINS ARE

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.968
INTEMPERANCE BUT IT HAS BECOME A

00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:05.336
FOR MORE OF A FAIR COMPETITION

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.772
STATUTE VAN A TEMPERANCE STATUTE

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:10.007
YASSIN'S PRACTICAL APPLICATION.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.008
I STILL I STILL THINK THEY'RE

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:13.310
THE UNDERPINNINGS OF TEMPERANCE.

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.045
IF IT WAS ELIMINATED PEOPLE

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.147
MIGHT START TALKING ABOUT

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:18.115
TEMPERANCE MORE BUT RIGHT NOW

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:23.687
IT'S MOSTLY. FOR COMPETITION

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:23.988
[inaudible]

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:27.191
RIGHT OKAY --

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.426
AND THAT'S THE BANDS OF THE TIRE

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:30.394
A SYSTEM PERMITS THE CREATION

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.962
AND GROWTH OF CALIFORNIA SMALL

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.197
BUSINESS.

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.432

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:36.267
SOMEWHERE THEY MAY STILL BE IN

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.468
AS I ALWAYS SAY THE ONE OF THE

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.736
REASONS THERE ARE THOUSAND

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:39.837
CRAFTERS IN THE STATE OF

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.405
CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:42.373
TITLE SYSTEM.

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:44.275
THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET ON STORE

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:47.978
SHELVES THEY CAN ACTUALLY MOVE

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:50.981
THEIR PRODUCT THROUGH COMMERCE --

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.516
IT ALSO IS A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:54.618
LOCAL INTERESTS TO BALANCE THEIR

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.854
OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.189
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY.

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.857
THEY'RE NOT.

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.692
THEY'RE NOT THE RE PEOPLE

NEED TO HAVE SOME LOCAL

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.498
CONNECTIONS AS OPPOSED TO BEING

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.933
CONTROLLED BY SOMEONE FAR AWAY

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.634
WHO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.203
NEIGHBORHOOD --

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.405
AND IT'S A DIFFERENT EDITORS ON

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:15.039
FOR COMPETITION [inaudible] FOR

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:17.741
SURE --

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:20.177
COMMON THERE STILL BRIBERY

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:21.946
EXTORTION.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:24.481

MORE COMMONLY IT'S CREATIVE

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.423
APPROACHES OF ADVERTISING WAYS

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:35.292

TO RETAILERS IN WAYS THAT --

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:45.736
SHORT OF BRIBES ARE --

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.572
DESIGNED TO CREATE A CONTROLLING

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:51.275
RELATIONSHIP WHERE BY RETAILERS

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.776
MORE LIKELY.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.211
TO CARRY THAT MANUFACTURES

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:57.381
PRODUCT BECAUSE OF COMMERCIAL

00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.084
INCENTIVES AS OPPOSED.

GIFT OF THOSE.

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:33.384
WORDS PART OF A IS THE IN

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.219
INCENTIVE PACKAGE IS THAT ARE

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.488

EQUIPMENT OF COULD YET SO THE

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.595
GENERAL RULE IS IT IS IS

AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE --

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:01.779
HE'LL SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE REFER

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:04.682
THERE'S AS LONG AS THE THE

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.283
RETAILERS ACTUALLY PAYING THEM A

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.952
LEASING FEE FOR THOSE

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:09.119
REFRIGERATORS BUT THE

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:11.055
REFRIGERATOR MIGHT SAY.

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:13.123
YOU KNOW CORES LIGHT ON OR

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.191
WHATEVER WOULD SAY SO THERE ARE

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.225
THERE SO MANY EXCEPTIONS AND

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.261
THEY'RE THEY'RE SO COMPLICATED.

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:18.829
THAT TEY'RE REALLY DESIGNED TO

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:22.700
ALLOW SOME CROSSOVER BUT NOT SO

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.468
MUCH THAT THE MANUFACTURE.

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:27.137
OF THE RETAILERS BEHOLDEN TO THE

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:33.877
MANUFACTURER --

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.846
NOW THE FRUSTRATIONS --

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.247
THERE ARE LOTS OF FRUSTRATIONS

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:38.449
ABOUT THIS IT'S VERY COUNTER

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:39.984
INTUITIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:40.718
WERE IN BUSINESS AND

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:43.220
PARTICULARLY WE SEE FRUSTRATIONS

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:46.790
AMONG -- IN --

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:48.192
CYBERSPACE WHO ARE AWARE OF NEW

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.893
BUSINESS MODELS WERE TRYING TO

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.562
FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN.

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:53.263
APPLY THE KINDS OF MARKETING

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.666
PRACTICES THEY HAVE ANOTHER FOR

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.101
AREAS TO ALCOHOL.

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:59.436
AND THEY JUST OTHER JUST STYMIED

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:04.308
BY THIS IDEA OF THE INABILITY OF

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.876
MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS FOR

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.144
EXAMPLE TO COORDINATE THEIR

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:09.279
ADVERTISING --

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.482
THAT IS PROHIBITED --

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.817
SO IS SO WE GET A LOT OF THAT

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.119
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:17.187
REALLY REALLY TRY TO WORK WITH

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.222
THEM.

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.857
AND HELP THEM CREE BUSINESS

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:22.993
MODEL SO THAT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL --

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.361
AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES A

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:25.763
LITTLE BIT CUMBERSOME FOR THEM

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.798
WE GENERALLY OUR EXPERIENCES

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.033
BEEN THAT WE CAN GET THEM TO

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:30.534
THEIR WAY THEY WERE WHERE THEY

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.802
WANTED TO GET.

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:34.071
WHICH IS BEING --

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:36.840
WHICH IS WHICH IS APPROPRIATE

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.575
PROMOTION OF MY AND MARKETING OF

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.744
PRODUCTS --

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:43.514
IN AN EXPERIENCE FOR THE CA TO

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.248
THEM.

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.750
BUT IT'S COMPLICATED --

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:48.152
BUT WE REALLY DO TRY TO BE

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:50.187
PROACTIVE WITH THEM AND HAVE AN

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.789
OPEN DOOR AND I MEET WITH PEOPLE

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.857

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:56.493
WEEK -- SO

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.796
WE WILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.397

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:01.899
YOU KNOW LAWS JUST SORT OF A

00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:03.901
FUNCTION OF YOU KNOW A BIKE ON

HERE -- AND

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:07.204
AND MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ALWAYS.

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.706
OBVIOUSLY ONE THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.241
DECIDES WHAT THEY ARE.

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:12.876
BUT A LOT OF IT IS JUST YOUR

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:14.745
VIEW OF OF HOW WE SHOULD BE

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:15.879
REGULATING SOMETHING THAT IS

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.915
ESSENTIALLY AN INTOXICATING

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.283
PRODUCT.

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:20.884
AND ALSO WHAT INTEREST YOUR

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.019

LOBBYIST WILL SAY YOU SHOULDN'T

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:32.830
DO THAT.

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.731
AND THAT TEAR WILL THEN ALSO AND

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.100
WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.601
ANOTHER TEAR WILL NOT WANT YOU

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:38.702
TO DO IT.

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:39.803
HAD A LOT OF THAT AS PER

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.140
PERSISTENCE IRVING THEIR TURF.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.741
RAIN -- AND

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:47.478
FOR US IT'S YOU KNOW WE WE FALL

00:45:47.544 --> 00:45:49.780
THE STATUE AND IT'S AN TEN AND

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:52.416
REALLY TRY --

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:54.017
TO KEEP THE TEARS SEPARATE TO

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.452
THE DEGREE.

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:58.622
THIS TELLS US TO DO IT RIGHT AND

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:00.724
THAT ARE REAL OUR OVER ARCHING

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:04.027
PRINCIPLE IS. ONE BUSINESS THAT

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.963
YOU SHOULD NOT CONTROL ANOTHER

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:09.233
BUSINESS WITHOUT A LICENSE.

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:10.601
AND THAT'S KIND OF REALLY ARE

SORT OF OUR BASE LINE FOR ALL

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.038
THIS -- AND

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:17.608
IT IT'S COMPLICATED BUT AGAIN WE

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.676
REALLY TRY TO BE OUT IN FRONT

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:23.680
AND HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT --

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.349
SOME SOME UNFAIR COMPETITION

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:27.084
TRADE --

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.585
SOME ON SOME RETAILERS DON'T

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:30.420
UNDERSTAND IT WHICH WE TRY TO

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.789
EDUCATE THEM IF WE FIND THEM

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.258
DOING THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T BE

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:35.826

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.928
THE KNOCK IT OFF FOR REALLY NOT.

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:40.264
TRYING TO BE PUNITIVE FROM.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.332
THE TITLE SYSTEM IS IS WE TALK

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:45.302
ABOUT FRACTURES CONTROLLING

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.504
RETAILERS THAT IS IN A LOT OF

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:49.540
WAYS JUST THE WAY RETAILERS

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:51.108
CHANGE HAS FLIPPED.

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:52.342
RIGHTS OF THE NOW RETAILERS THAT

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.745
ARE SO BIG AND POWERFUL THAT

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:55.646
THEY CAN ACTUALLY START

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.281
CONTROLLING WHAT MANUFACTURERS

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:57.981
ARE DOING.

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.716
SO SO ARE MOST SOME OF OUR MOST

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.752
RECENT INVESTIGATIONS IN FACT IN

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:04.254
TERMS OF COMMERCIAL BRIBERY HAVE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.722
REALLY BEEN.

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:08.725
WHERE MANUFACTURERS EVEN LARGE

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:09.960
MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN?

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:11.828
THE VICTIMS OF RETAILERS

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.197
DEMANDING --

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:15.365
PAYMENTS IN KICKBACKS TO HAVE

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:17.634
THEIR PRODUCTS ON THEIR SHELVES --

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.269
NON LICENSEES AS I WAS SAYING

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:22.239
BEFORE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.074
YOU KNOW RUN A RUN AROUND AND

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.609
CREATE AN APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.177
DO A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THERE

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.779
ARE ON THE PHONE.

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:30.147
OR HOWEVER THEY WANT TO WANT TO

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.248
DO IT --

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.951
THEY REALLY RUN INTO PROBLEMS

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:36.019
WITH WITH THE THE PROHIBITIONS

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:38.155
AGAINST ADVERTISING MARKETING

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.556
BETWEEN BUSINESSES.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.558
BUT AGAIN I I I TRULY BELIEVE

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.927
THAT FOR MOST OF THIS --

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.262
WE WE ARE ABLE TO GET OUT IN

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.597
FRONT AND HELP THEM DESIGN

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:49.633
MODELS THAT SAID.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.034
I DO THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:53.036
IF WE COULD AS AN AGENCY HAVE

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.172
PROACTIVE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.907
SHOW PEOPLE HOW TO HOW THE RIGHT

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:57.841
BUSINESS MODEL.

00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:00.877
UNLIKE MOST STATUTES WHERE --

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.346
IF THERE'S NOT A LAW AGAINST IT

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.414
YOU CAN DO IT AND ALCOHOL THE

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.250
THE LAW IS YOU CANNOT DO

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:08.819
ANYTHING UNLESS THERE'S A LAW

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.120
THAT SAYS YOU CAN.

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.755
SO SO FOR US ACTUALLY WE THINK

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:13.657
ROUTE REGULATIONS WE MOSTLY

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.360
THINK ABOUT THEM IN TERMS OF

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.395
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE --

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:21.198
GIVE THEM GUIDELINES AND IS THAT

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.566
HOW THEY CAN HAVE A LEGITIMATE

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:26.470
BUSINESS IN THE WAY WITH A ONE

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.272
AND THEN FINALLY LOTS AND LOTS

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.273
AS I WAS SAYING WITH GIANT

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:30.474
RETAILERS WERE JUST SEEING AN

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.776
INCREASING NUMBER OF JUST PEOPLE.

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:35.178
BASICALLY DELIBERATELY VIOLATING.

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:38.081
HOUSE LOS --

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.616
AND BECAUSE I LIKE TO IN ON A

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:40.651
POSITIVE NOTE.

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:43.887
I'LL JUST IN WITH CHAMPAGNE --

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.589
CHAMPAGNE IS --

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.524
THE STILL LOW PARTS OF SILICON

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.526
VALLEY I MEAN I'M NAPA VALLEY

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.261
NOW COULD ARGUE --

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:53.163
THE TOTAL ON PROBABLY IS GREATER

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.699
GREAT VALUE THEN --

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.167
CHAMPION BUT IT'S STILL THE THE

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.835
THE BEST GREAT VALUE IN THE

00:48:58.902 --> 00:48:59.836
WORLD.

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:02.205
AND IT IS THE MOST STRICTLY

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.574
REGULATED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.443
PROBABLY IN THE WORLD --

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.645
THERE IS A THERE ARE RULES ON

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.913
HOW MANY.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:14.951
LINES YOU CAN PLANT HOW MANY IN --

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.853
THERE ARE RULES IN TERMS OF OUT

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.755
ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN TERMS OF

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.023
IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A CERTAIN

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.559
KIND OF CHAMPAGNE WHAT WHAT HOW

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:23.927
MUCH USED HAS TO BE IN IT.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:27.064
AND THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.700
MUCH IN FAVOR OF THEIR SYSTEM

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.301
AND THAT SYSTEM HAS WORK FOR

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:32.536
THEM -- A

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.571
BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IS

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.340
SUPPORTIVE OF IT --

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:38.141
AND IS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO IT'S

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:40.277
AN UNUSUAL AREA IT'S AN UNUSUAL

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:41.511
INDUSTRY --

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.513
IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS HIGHLY

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.982
REGULATED.

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.551
AND MOST PEOPLE IN IT.

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.086
WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S TO ITS

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:49.820
BENEFITS SO.

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:51.321
I'M NOT REALLY TRYING TO PUSH

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:54.091
GOVERNMENT REGULATION GENERALLY

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.727
BUT THIS IS THIS IS AN AREA

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:59.396
WHERE IT IT DEMANDS SOME SECOND

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.397
THOUGHT ABOUT ITS PRIORITY

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:02.065
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:02.966
TYPICAL.

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.901
SO ANYWAY WITHOUT I'M MY

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.536
COMMENTS ARE AN END UP ON HAPPY

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:07.137
ANSWER ANY QUESTION THAT YOU

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:08.605

SO I'M TO START OUT WITH SENATOR

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:11.475
BRADFORD.

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:12.442
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.710
YOU SHOULD QUESTION AS RELATES

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:18.515
TO DIVERSITY AND THE ABC HAVE

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:21.118
ANY OVER.

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.085
TO LOOK THAT LANDS BECAUSE WE

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.787
SELL A LOT MORE MINORITY

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:24.888
DISTRIBUTORS AND YOU SEEM LIKE

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.223
THEY'VE GONE BY THE WAYSIDE SO

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:28.058
IS THAT AREA OF CONCERN. FOR A.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.460
B. C. OR IS THAT MORE OF A

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.829
CORPORATE DECISION ON WITH A

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:33.730
CONTRACT YEAH IT'S REALLY MORE

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:34.364
OF A CORPORATE DECISION WHO THE

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:35.031
CONTRACT WITH THERE'S BEEN A LOT

00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:36.199
OF SICK CONSOLIDATION IN THE

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.534
DISTRIBUTOR INDUSTRY AND I DON'T

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:38.435
KNOW IF THAT.

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:40.971
IS PART OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS --

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.873
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS JUST MORE%

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:45.275
AND MORE IN TERMS OF RETAILERS

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:47.043
AS?

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.145

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:49.513
COMMUNITIES --

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:52.916
BOTH IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHO

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.084
THIS AND WHO --

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.986
WHO PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT SO

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.654
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.256
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CLOSELY

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.590
OURSELVES --

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:03.794
BECAUSE MOSTLY WERE RESPONDING

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.197
TO LOCAL ISSUES --

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.833
BE THE A YOU KNOW FROM ALL

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.867
MEMBERS BRING THEM FOREVER YOU

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:11.735
HAVE NO OVERSIGHT ON

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.336
DISTRIBUTION OR MANUFACTURING

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.738
AND LOOK AT THAT WE DO BUT WE

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:16.940
DON'T HAVE ANY ANY AUTHORITY OR

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.775
ANALYSIS OF WHO'S OWNING THOSE

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:22.179
BUSINESSES OTHER THAN WHETHER

00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:25.916
THEY'RE QUALIFIED.

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:28.418
THANK YOU MY LAST QUESTION.

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:28.652
IT IS --

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:29.553
HOME DELIVERY I BAD DON'T

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.687
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT PARTS OF

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.288
THE COUNTRY.

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.756
PEOPLE ARE DELIVERING GROCERIES

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.057
AND AND THINGS YOU KNOW YOU SEE

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:35.459
NEW YORK CHICAGO AND AND AND

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:37.327
CALIFORNIA'S START TO PICK UP.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:39.362
OUR WE REGULATE IN THAT THAT WE

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:40.297
DON'T --

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:41.965
DELIVER TO MINORS --

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.166
AT THE HOME.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.901
SO WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY THERE'S

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.570
NO LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.405
PERTAIN TO IT IN PARTICULAR BUT

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.073
WHAT THE WAY WE TREATED IS THAT

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.709
THE RETAILERS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.077
FROM THE MOMENT IT LEAVES ITS

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:56.646
DOOR. TO THE MOMENT TO IT THE

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.782
PURCHASE A CURSE SO IF THEY USE

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.016
THEIR OWN DELIVERY DRIVERS.

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.686
BUT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WITH

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.354
THE US SALE TO A MINOR IF THEY

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.157
HANDED OVER. TO TO DRIZZLY OR

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:08.859
SOME OTHER THIRD PARTY COMPANY.

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.260
AND THERE'S A SALE TO A MINOR BY

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.461
SOMEONE THEY DON'T EMPLOY.

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.163
THE RETAILERS DON'T STILL

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.999
RESPONSIBLE FOR I DON'T KNOW BUT

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.701
IT'S REDUCE THE MODEL WE USE

00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:18.835
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY WE

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.170
HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.004
SALE.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:23.006
BUT AGAIN WE REALLY HAD NO.

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:25.342
ISSUES.

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:27.410
THE INDUSTRY THUS FAR ISN'T AS

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:27.911
FAR AS WE KNOW HAS BEEN

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.413
RESPONSIBLE --

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.615
AS YOU KNOW I'M CURRENTLY

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:32.582
WORKING ON LEGISLATION WILL

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:35.685
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL --

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.287
LICENSES --

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:38.588
FOR RESTAURANTS.

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.723
HERE -- I

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:40.891
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PERHAPS

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:44.895
MAYBE YOU ADDRESS THE BOTH THE

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:47.364
POPULAR THE POPULATION LIMITS

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.100
FOR OFF SALE AND ON SALE.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.135
YES SO KIND OF THE HIT AROUND

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.403
WAS A DIFFERENT SURE SO SO WITH

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.139
SO WITH RESTAURANTS ANYONE --

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:58.141
THERE'S NO.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.943
THERE'S WITH RESTAURANTS THAT

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.610
WANT TO SELL HARD DISTILLED

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.045
SPIRITS --

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.580
THERE'S A LIMIT BY --

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:06.283
BY COUNTY TO ONE PER TWO

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.484
THOUSAND RESIDENTS --

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.985
AND NOW IT'S JUST STRAIGHT UP IN

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:10.287
STATUTES --

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:13.290
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IN NINETEEN

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:15.425
SIXTY ONE AND ONE FROM ONE

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:15.992
THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:16.626
THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.228
BABY BOOM AND THE CONCERN THAT

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.230
THERE WAS GOING TO BE JUST ON A

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:23.266
RUSH OF LICENSES CREATED.

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:24.834
AT THAT TIME --

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:29.306
SO IT'S RENTS THEMSELVES MOST OF

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:32.175
THE CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE WITH --

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.476
WITH THAT WELL CALL STEPS IN

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.579
SCHOOL ABOUT ARE NOT RESTAURANTS

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:36.780
THEIR NIGHTCLUBS.

00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:39.182
SO IN IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.184
HAS CHANGED SO MUCH PEOPLE JUST

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.886
PLAIN EAT OUT MORE THEY SPEND

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.688
MORE ON THERE'S JUST MUCH MORE
