WE WILL CALL THE. ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO ORDER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ALL IN ATTENDANCE FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE. IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY. OF FORMER UC REGENT MONEY REESE SO WILL HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO REPLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LEVINE FOR TODAY'S HEARING. ALSO THAT FILE ITEM EIGHT. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY EIGHT HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR AND WILL NOT BE HEARD. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR BUILDS HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ALLOW TESTIMONY. TWO WITNESSES FOR SUPPORT TWO WITNESSES FOR THE OPPOSITION TO SPEAK FOR TWO MORE MINUTES EACH. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET. NOPE SO WE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST AUTHOR. MISS MELENDEZ FILE ITEM FIVE. BILL NUMBER TWENTY EIGHTY ONE. YOU HEAR. ALRIGHT WELCOME WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I AM HERE. TWO PRESENTS TO YOU COMING ONLINE MATERIALS OUT HERE AB TWENTY EIGHTY ONE. THIS IS THE CAMPUS FREE SPEECH BILL. NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS COUNTRY BECAME THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FREE WORLD THAT WORLD WAS BUILT UPON THE REVOLUTIONARY IDEA THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CREATED EQUAL. AND WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS THE CHIEF AMONG THOSE RATES OF COURSE BEING FREEDOM OF SPEECH. UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEEN A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THAT PERSPECTIVE THE PLACE THAT ONCE PRIDED ITSELF AS THE LAND OF FREE EXPRESSION. HAS ABANDONED THOSE VALUES FOR INTOLERANCE WE DO NOT HAVE TO LOOK MUCH FURTHER THAN WHAT IS HAPPENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. TOO MANY STUDENTS CONSISTENTLY FEAR SPEAKING THEIR MINDS BECAUSE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE FAILED TO UPHOLD AND PROTECT THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO. THEY HAVE BEEN HARASSED THEY HAVE BEEN BEATEN THEY HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED BY OTHER STUDENTS FOR BEING PART OF A PARTICULAR CLUB OR HAVING A CERTAIN OPINION. COURT YARDS IN GYMNASIUMS HAVE BEEN DAMAGING EVEN LET ON FIRE SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THE EMOTIONAL MATURITY TO LISTEN TO THE OPINION OF ANOTHER THE HAPPENS TO DIFFER FROM THEIRS. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SILENCED BY THEIR OWN PROFESSORS THE VERY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE MENTORING THEM ENCOURAGING. FREE THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION. AND THE RESPONSE OF THEIR COLLEGES ADMINISTRATORS HAS BEEN THAT THE BARD STUDENTS FROM INVITING SPEAKERS THAT OFFENDS THEIR PEERS. I. I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN ONE OF THEM IS A COLLEGE. FRESHMAN. I SEND MY KIDS TO COLLEGE BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE OF HIGHER LEARNING AND I WANT THEM TO LEARN MORE. ABOUT THE WORLD IN PARTICULAR ISSUES NOT CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SAME THINGS THAT THEY ARE READY BELIEVE THIS AS PART OF THE PROBLEM I THINK WE HAVE. WITH OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS WE ARE KEEPING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN A BUBBLE IN ALLOWING THEM TO ONLY HEAR THE THINGS WITH WHICH THEY AGREE AND I THINK THAT IT'S. A GREAT TRAGEDY THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. UP STUDENTS HAVE BEEN LEFT HELPLESS IN OF TURNED A BLIND EYE TOWARD. THEIR FENDERS AND THEY HAVE TURNED A GOD GIVEN INALIENABLE RIGHT INTO A FOUR BY FOUR FOOT SQUARE THAT IS CALLED A SAFE SPACE. I'M MRS AMERICA LAST TIME I CHECKED BE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS A SAFE SPACE. I AM ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT THE CAMPUS FREE SPEECH ACT TODAY TO PROTECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN EVERY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENT I KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU COME FROM EDUCATION BACKGROUND I'M CERTAIN. THAT YOU CAN. SYMPATHIZER PERHAPS EMPATHIZE WITH THE STUDENTS WHO ARE FEELING THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE HEARD. IN THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT TO SILENCE THEM THAT IS THE POINT OF EDUCATION IS IT NOT IS TO ALLOW PEOPLE. TO EXPAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE BE ON A VERY VERY SMALL AREA THAT THEY EXISTED WHEN THEY START COLLEGE. AT THIS BILL WILL CREATE AN OFFICIAL FREE SPEECH POLITICS POLICY UNIVERSITY SHALLOT DOT I STRONGLY AFFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON CAMPUS IT WILL PREVENT. ADMINISTRATORS FROM DISINTEGRATING SPEAKERS BECAUSE THEY DIPS DISAGREE WITH THAT SPEAKERS BELIEFS. AND IT WILL REQUIRE UNIVERSITIES TO DEVELOP DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS FOR ANYONE WHO INTERFERES VIOLENTLY. WITH THESE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS IT WILL REQUIRE STUDENTS TO BE INFORMED OF THE FREE SPEECH POLICY AT THEIR FRESHMAN ORIENTATION IN REQUIRE EACH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. TO CREATE A FREE SPEECH COMMITTEE THAT WILL ISSUE A YEARLY REPORT TO THE PUBLIC TO THE GOVERNOR INTO THE LEGISLATURE. ON HOW FREE SPEECH IS BEING HANDLED ON CAMPUS. IT WILL PREVENT INSTITUTIONS FROM CHARGING IT STUDENTS OUTRAGEOUS SECURITY FEES FOR THEIR EVENTS AN OUTLAW FREE SPEECH ZONES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA NEED TO BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD AND PROTECTING. THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THEY NEED TO FOSTER THE EXPRESSION. IN THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR ALL STUDENTS NOT HINDER IT IN HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MAGNIFICENT BILL WHICH I HOPE YOU'LL BE SUPPORTING. IS JIM MANLEY FROM THE GOLDWATER INSTITUTE OF PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION AS WELL AS NOW WE THOMAS FROM THE BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. JIM KNOW WE'D WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST. GENDO THINK OF OF THE THING YOU THE LEGAL THAT CLOSER TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE WE ANNOUNCE THE MODEL POLICY THAT THIS BILL IS BASED ON AT THE END OF JANUARY LAST YEAR AND THREE DAYS LATER UC BERKELEY WAS ON FIRE BECAUSE MY YET OPPOSITE BEEN SCHEDULED SPEAK THEIR. THIS WAS WRITTEN AS AND A NATIONAL POLICY TO ADDRESS THE CAMPUS FREE SPEECH CRISIS. CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUELY SHOWN WHY IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STAND IN FIRM SUPPORT OF FREE EXPRESSION ON CAMPUS. WE WE DON'T THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING FOR FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION IS TO PROTECT IDEAS THAT ARE UNPOPULAR. WE DON'T NEED A FIRST AMENDMENT FOR IDEAS THAT WE ALL AGREE WITH WE NEED TO PROTECT MINORITY VIEWS NOT EVEN AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE VIEWS ARE REPULSIVE TO MOST PEOPLE. I'D. THE IT AND WE LOSE OUT IF WE SILENCE OPINIONS THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE WE LOSE WHAT MILL CALLED THE CLEARER PERCEPTION AND LIVELIER IMPRESSION OF TRUTH PRODUCED BY ITS COLLISION WITH ERROR. THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY RESTORING FREE EXPRESSION AS A LIVING TRADITION ON CAMPUS AND THAT'S WHAT ABOUT THIS BILL A. B. TWENTY EIGHTY ONE ACCOMPLISHES. THE POLICIES WORKING IN WISCONSIN WHERE THE REGIONS HAVE ADOPTED IT ITS WORKING IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AT. AND WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA ITS COMMITMENT TO FREE EXPRESSION STRONGER. AND IT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY OF THE PROBLEMS SUGGESTED BY THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IT'S A NICE STATE FUNDING ONLY FOR UNIVERSITIES THAT IGNORE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE EXPRESSION. AND IT ELIMINATES ONLY ARBITRARY FREE SPEECH ZONES AND SO UP FOR EXAMPLE PIERCE COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES WERE STUDENT WAS. DISCIPLINE FOR HAND OUT COPIES OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE HE WAS NOT IN THE DESIGNATED% POSTAGE STAMP SIZE FREE SPEECH ZONE. AND SEVEN STATES HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN RID OF THESE THESE FREE SPEECH ZONES THAT RESULT IN NEEDLESS LITIGATION. I END AND EXPENSIVE. THAT LITIGATION IN ORDER TO TO PROTECT THAT THE SIMPLE RIGHTTO HAND OUT A CONSTITUTION OR HAVE OR HAVE A DISCUSSION. IT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO CHARGE STUDENT SECURITY FEES. BUT IT DOES NOT ALLOW THOSE SECURITY FEES TO BE BASED ON THE VIEWPOINT OF AN INVITED SPEAKER AND THAT IS BLACK LETTER CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ALREADY. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA IT IT IS ROUTINELY IGNORED OR. TO BE TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTOOD BY ADMINISTRATORS AND AGAIN RESULTS IN ME LISTEN EXPENSIVE LITIGATION BUT THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT. THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT ADMINISTRATORS FROM CANCELING EVENTS FOR LEGITIMATE CONCERT SECURITY CONCERNS BUT IT DOES PREVENT. ABOUT CANCELING EVENTS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION DISAGREES WITH THE VIEWPOINT OF THE SPEAKER OR BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT. THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE A STRONG REACTION TO THE SPEAKER THOSE ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL REASONS FOR FOR CANCELING A SPEECH. AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOWED THOSE REASONS TO BE THE REASONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION POINTS TO. AND OF COURSE THE BILL BALANCES RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WITH FREE SPEECH RIGHTS AS THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO DO BY PUTTING BOTH THOSE RIGHTS IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. SO IT IN SOME THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH FOR EVERYONE FOR INVITED SPEAKERS. PROTESTERS WHO WANT TO PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINT. AFTER YOU WERE KNIFE WE FIND OURSELVES ON CAMPUS HAVING A HEATED DISCUSSION. THAT IS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT A BATTLE OF IDEAS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO PROTECT. AYE WELL BEFORE I BEGIN MY BRIEF REMARKS AT FIRST LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY REPRESENT THE CONCERNS OF MY PEERS. I'M NOT EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY THAT FREE SPEECH IS ON LIFE SUPPORT AT UC BERKELEY. THE GENESIS OF THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT HAS SINCE DISINTEGRATED INTO AN AYE LOGICAL ECHO CHAMBER WITH THOSE WHO CONSERVE YOUR POINTS. ARE STOCKED HARASSED AND SOMETIMES EVEN BEATEN AS A CONSERVATIVE STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY I HAVE BEEN CHASED I'VE BEEN PUNCHED I'VE BEEN STOCK HAVE BEEN SPAT ON WALL ON CAMPUS. AND OTHER CONSERVE SCENES HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TREATMENT VERY FEW RECENT HEADLINES FROM LOCAL NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA OUTLETS. SHOCKING MOMENT WHEN TWO MEN VICIOUSLY ATTACKED THE TRUMP SUPPORTER A MEMBER OF THE BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS WHILE HE WALKED TO CLASS AND BERKELEY THIS WAS CAUGHT ON VIDEO. VANDAL CULTURE BEHEADING LYNCHING OF BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS PROTESTERS RUSHED BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS THIS WAS ALSO CAUGHT ON VIDEO ON CAMPUS. ANONYMOUS GROUP PLANS TO DOC'S BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS AND THEIR AND THEIR CAREERS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE TAXI OF EXPERIENCE ON CAMPUS I DO NOT FEEL SAFE ON MY OWN CAMPUS. AND REGARDLESS OF OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCES I HOPE THAT WE CAN AGREE THAT VIOLENCE INTIMIDATION SHOULD NOT REPLACE DEBATE AND DISCOURSE. HOWEVER AYE AYE I DID ONLY EXPERIENCE RESISTANCE FROM STUDENTS BUT ALSO THE UNIVERSITY. WHEN MY ORGANIZATION THE BERKELEY COLLEGE REPUBLICANS ATTEMPTED TO HOST CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS AT UC BERKELEY. OUR GOAL WAS SERVE BY STUDENTS A PERSPECTIVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE PERSPECTIVE THAT'S USUALLY NOT HEARD IN UC BERKELEY CLASSROOMS. ULTIMATELY AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THREE EVENTS WERE CANCELED DUE TO RIOTS OR THREATS OF THEM. ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEFT WING ANARCHISTS IN BERKELEY BEAT INNOCENT BYSTANDERS IN THE STREETS. SET FIRES LOOTED SMALL BUSINESSES AND CHASE MEMBERS OF MY ORGANIZATION AND INCLUDING MYSELF. THIS WAS THE SCENE WHEN A PROM CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR WAS SET TO SPEAK AT UC BERKELEY BUT WAS ULTIMATELY SHUT DOWN THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS. IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT NIGHT THAT ONLY FAIR VIEW POINTS MAY BE HEARD ON CAMPUS WITH NO MEANINGFUL OPPOSITION. OR CHALLENGE PERMITTED AND THAT THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CAMPUS FREE SPEECH COULD LEAD TO BYSTANDERS BEING ATTACKED. ON APRIL TWELFTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN ORGANIZATION HAVE TO CANCEL A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT FEATURING CONSERVE COMMENTATOR. DAVID HOROWITZ DUE TO POTENTIAL PROTEST UNIVERSITY PLACED A THREE PM CURFEW A TIME IN WHICH MANY STUDENTS RANK CLASS. AND ALSO SITES LOCATION AS MORE THAN A MILE AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF CAMPUS IT WAS BUSSING DISTANCE. WERE ALSO STRONGLY ENCOURAGED NOT TO PUBLICIZE OUR OWN EVENT. ON TOP OF AN ALREADY SO HAPPY SECURITY FEE OF NEARLY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WHO ARE FAT P. PAID MORE. IF YOU WANT TO INVITE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF UNREASONABLE RESTRICTIONS ARE VAN. WE COULD NOT AFFORD AND HOUSING MISTER HARTLEY IT'S. THIS WAS OUR SECOND EVENT CANCELED DUE TO RESTRICTIONS AS A RESULT OF POTENTIAL PROTESTS. OUR VENT IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR AND CULTURE WAS UNILATERALLY COUNCIL BY THE UNIVERSITY. FIRST EVENT WE PARTNER WITH THE NONPARTISAN GROUP BRIDGE CAL THROUGHOUT THE CONCERT PERSPECTIVE. FOR THEIR SPEAKER SERIES ON IMMIGRATION THE LIBERAL VIEWPOINT WAS REPRESENTED BY MARIE ACHIEVE US SAY THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TO BILL CLINTON. HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY ONCE AGAIN IMPOSE THE. A SERIES OF ON RESULT RESTRICTIONS ARE SCHEDULED EVENT. HOWEVER IT WAS DURING A MEETING WITH CAMPUS POLICE AND ADMINISTRATION THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT AN UNWRITTEN POLICY THAT WOULD APPLY TO EVENTS WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE. INDEED THE UNIVERSITY HAD BEEN ARBITRARILY IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OFFENSE UNDER THE BACKDROP OF AN UNWRITTEN CONCEALED POLICY KNOWN AS THE HIGH PROFILE SPEAKER POLICY. THIS POLICY WAS LIKELY APPLY TO OUR SPEAKER WILMER MARIA ATROPOS IN VINCENTE FOX. THE FORMER PRESIDENT MEXICO IN ART BILLY HIGH PROFILE SPEAKER WAS IT THE SPEAK WELL PAST THREE PM CURFEW. AND INVENTORS NEAR THE CENTER OF CAMPUS. IT'S CLEAR THAT LIB LIBERAL VIEWPOINTS ARE PRESENT WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS WILL THE UNIVERSITY PLACE. ATHLETE IN ESCALATING SERIES OF RESTRICTIONS ON OUR EVENTS. THE HIGH PROFILE SPEAKER POLICY INSURES THAT THE UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH SPEECH TO PERMIT. AND THEN JUSTIFY THEIR A LIVE EVENT CENSORSHIP BY POINTING TO THEIR UNWRITTEN AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICY. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THIS POLICY WITH HASELY CHANGED NEARLY EVERY WEEK. ULTIMATELY AFTER MASSIVE POLICE PRESENCE THE DAMAGE CULTURES PROPOSED SPEAKING DATES THE ANTI FASCIST OTHER LEFT WING GROUPS A NACHO IN FACT BERKELEY ANTI FOR RELEASE IN OP ED STATING THAT HAD NO PLANS TO DISRUPT AND COLTER'S EVENT. THE EVENT WAS CANCEL AS RESULT OF UNSUBSTANTIATED AND VAGUE SECURITY CONCERNS THAT WHICH LEAD TO UC BERKELEY REFUSING TO PROVIDE A VENUE. ALSO KNOWN AS THE HECKLER'S VETO WHICH IS BARRED BY SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HOSTED CONSERVES COMMENTATOR BEN SHAPIRO. INITIALLY THE UNIVERSE INFORMED US THAT THEY HAD NO SPACE AVAILABLE FOR MR SHAPIRO TO SPEAK AND BUT AFTER THE MEDIA REPORTS. A THE UNIVERSITY RACKS WE FOUND A VENUE. ADDITIONALLY LAST MINUTE RECEDING WITH KIND HALF BECAUSE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE IN BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY FEAR THAT SOMEONE MAY TRIP FROM THE UPPER SEATING AREA. I ASK UNIVERSITY WHAT CHARLES WILL HAVE TO DO IT MISTER SHAPIRO IF THE UNIVERSITY HAD TO HAD SLASH SITTING IN HALF WHEN JUSTICE THAT MY OR. PRESIDENT CLINTON AND CENTER SANDERS SPOKEN THAT SAME EXACT VENUE. THAT MINISTRATION EVER ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. WE HAVE SINCE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY THE RECENT RECENTLY THE JUDGE AGREED THAT THE UNIVERSITY'S POLICY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. ULTIMATELY EVERY TIME THE UC IMPOSES ON COSTUMES UNCONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS EXPOSE THE UC SYSTEM TO LEGAL LIABILITY. LOSSES CONSUME TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT CAN BE INSTEAD USE AYE DUCATION. IN CONCLUSION THIS IS ONLY MY EXPERIENCE AT UC BERKELEY BUT I'VE SEEN THE STICKER ON OTHER YOU SEE CANCERS AS WELL. EVERY GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE THE VANGUARD OF PRESERVING FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IT IS IMPORTANT TO GUARANTEE FREE SPEECH NOW FOR TODAY. AS IT IS CONSERVANCY BEING SUPPRESSED TODAY BUT TOMORROW CAN BE ANYONE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND. IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY CLEANERS. SEEM NINE. ANY COMMENTS. IT'S QUIRK SILVA. I'M I'M GONNA TAKE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP BECAUSE I DO THINK IT ISN'T ISSUE OF TOPIC. ON FOR THE LAST REALLY ALMOST TWO YEARS. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT FREE SPEECH SPEECH HAS BEEN. IN THE CENTER OF DISCUSSIONS WHAT WHERE I WOULD DISAGREE. IS UP. UNLIKE SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION FOR BERKELEY I THINK FREE SPEECH IS A LIVE IN LA WELL I MEAN AS WE SEE I THINK PART OF IT IS THE LOCATION. I MEAN BERKELEY IS NO ONE TO BE VERY VERY PROGRESSIVE BUT IN MY HOME CITY OF FULLERTON CALIPHATE FULLER TEN THEY INDEED DID CLOSED UP MY LOW YOU NOVELISTS. AND THAT TOO CAME WITH. A LOT OF CONCERN BUT THE WAY THEY HANDLED THAT WAS TO HAVE. HIS SPEAKING VENUE ONE A PART OF THE CAMPUS ON ANOTHER PART OF THE CAMPUS TO ALLOW OTHERS TO SET UP THEIR BOOTHS TO GIVE OUT INFORMATION AND SO FORTH. IT DID COST A LOT IN SECURITY BUT AGAIN OF ONE OF THE THE SITUATIONS OF WE TURNED IT AROUND AND INSTEAD OF SAYING IT WAS A CONCERT OF THE. CONSERVATIVE A CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER IT MIGHT BE A MORE PROGRESSIVE OR EVEN SOME US A SPEAKER LIKE. VINCENTE FOX WOULD HAVE THE OFFICES SO IN ESSENCE ORANGE COUNTY. WOULD BE MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER I THINK. A A. SUPPORTING A SAY MILO. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE OTHERS WHO THINK THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE SO AN EXAMPLE IS TONIGHT IN THE FULLERTON CITY. UP COUNCIL THEY WILL BE HEARING. ABOUT DONE SANCTUARY CITIES. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY CONTROVERSY ALL WE ALREADY KNOW AND ARE SEEN PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES MOBILIZE TO BE ABLE TO STATE THEIR VIEWS NOW HOW THAT WILL BE HANDLED IN THAT COUNCIL CHAMBER. OF WHETHER THEY CAN HOLD UP A SIGN WHERE THEY CAN YELL OUT THOSE ARE ALL PROTOCOL DEPENDING ON EACH COUNCIL BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT THIS IS TAKING OFF IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND PEOPLE ARE BEING BUSTED ON BOTH SIDES SO YOU MAY HAVE A SOME OF VERY IF YOU WANT TO CALL A NEO*. OR VERY MUCH A PORT OF AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHERS BUT IT'S ALL HOW WE REFER TO THESE. DESCRIPTIONS BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE STUDENTS AT. BERKELEY SO IF THE FASCISTS LEFT WELL SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS OR STUDENTS JUST LIKE YOU AND IT'S ALL HOW WE PHRASE THINGS IN AND WE ARE IN A VERY VERY POLARIZED. OF. SCENARIO IN OUR COUNTRY NOW MORE THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN. BUT I CAN EVEN TELL YOU AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN FULLER TOMORROW IS FOR EIGHT YEARS. IN OUR FARMERS MARKET WHEN I WANTED JUST TO PASS OUT UP PIECE OF LITERATURE RELATED TO MY CAMPAIGN THE COUNCIL SAID I COULDN'T. NOW THIS IS IN A PUBLIC VENUE SO OVER AND OVER I'VE HAD THE REVERSE THE VET WHICH IS. UP WILL LET YOU COME HERE AND DO THIS BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT I THINK. MANY WAYS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WE HAVE SOME REALLY REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES OF HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR THAT UP REALLY MAKES BOTH SIDES OF. THAT WHETHER IT'S BURNING OR FIRES AT WORK OR ATTACK WE CAN SEE THAT ON BOTH SIDES I KNOW WATCHING THINGS LIVE. ONE I'VE SEEN IF YOU WANT TO CALL MORE PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE. ENGAGE IN A. NAME CALLING VIOLENCE THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE AND I'M SURE THAT'S THE SAME THING WHEN YOU'VE WON TRUMP WAS DOING HIS BIG POLITICAL SPEECH IF YOU SAW SOMEBODY PUNCH SOMEONE I DON'T THINK YOU FELT LIKE HEY THAT REPRESENTS US. SO I. I DO THINK FREE SPEECH IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO UP MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF US CAN ENGAGE CHEN BUT. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SCENARIOS CAL STATE FULLERTON IS MY PRIME EXAMPLE WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF. I GUESS CHATTER AND CONCERN THAT THAT PRESIDENT AGREED TO UP LET THAT SPEAKER COME AND BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT WERE PARAMETERS THAT WERE SET UP. THAT AND ENDED UP LEADING THE EVENT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT A SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I THINK BERKELEY WAS THE EXAMPLE OF WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. SO JUST SOME COMMENTS. A MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY MAKE SOME. I MAKE A RESPONSE THROUGH YOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD OKAY. SO. YOUR I THINK THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS PRESENTED WITH RESPECT TO THAT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING. WHILE INTERESTING DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO REALLY WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY OR THIS BILL I'M NOR DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH. WHAT SOMEONE IS ALLOWED TO DO WHEN THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING ON WHAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT'S IT THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY DISCUSS ANOTHER TIME BUT I THINK? YEAH AND YOU LEAD WITH THE FACT THE YOU. UNDERSTAND THAT FREE SPEECH IS INDEED. UNDER ATTACK AT MANY OF OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHICH WE DO NOT WANT I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE IF. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE RULES WERE PUT INTO PLACE THAT IF YOU COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING THAT WAS OFFENSIVE TO SOMEONE ELSE YOU COULDN'T HAVE WITNESSES COME MEN. WHO WERE OFFENSIVE TO THE MAJORITY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE? WE WOULD NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE. RIGHT THIS IS IT'S. WE'RE GROWN UPS NOW AND COLLEGE STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STILL PAYING THE BILLS FOR THEM. THEY'RE STILL GROWN UPS RIGHT THERE YOUNG ADULTS AND THERE COMES A POINT IN TIME WHERE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THEY HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS TO SAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT BUT THAT'S THE REAL WORLD AND IF WE CONTINUE TO PUT THEM IN THIS BUBBLE. WHERE WE SAY NO NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THAT SPEAKER IN WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR THAT OTHER SPEAKER EITHER BECAUSE THERE IS A SMALL GROUP OF YOU? WHO'S DECIDED TO PROTEST THIS. THEN WHAT ARE WE TEACHING THESE KIDS GOD FOR BID THEY END UP IN THE LEGISLATURE HERE AND DECIDE THAT THEY JUST CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT THEY CAN'T LISTEN THAT PERSON THEY CAN'T HEAR THAT SPEAKER YOU CAN'T BRING THAT WITNESS. WE'RE DOING A GREAT DISSERVICE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BITE BY DOING THIS AND I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU FEEL THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN YOUR DISTRICT IS DOING A WONDERFUL JOB OF HANDLING THIS. BUT I AM TELLING YOU THAT PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE TELLING ME THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THERE'S ONE WITNESS HERE TODAY WHO ACCUSE TESTIFIED TO THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE WHO WOULD LINE UP BEHIND HIM TO SAY THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING. THERE IS SOME SPEAKERS COMING TO SOME OF THESE COLLEGES THAT I DON'T. AGREE WITH. BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE GROWING AND LEARNING YOU LISTEN YOU'LL PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS TO SAY. MAYBE YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING YOU IT BE YOU AGREE WITH THEM ON. MAYBE NOT BUT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN. IT'S THE REAL WORLD SO I'M I DON'T. YOU KNOW I'D MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO RESPOND TO THAT THEM. AS WORKS OF. THAT AMERICA WAS YOU SEE TO COME UP AND WITHOUT GETTING INTO A BACK AND FORTH SPEECH AND DEBATE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE HAVING SPEECH AND DEBATE AND THAT IS WHAT. THE INTENT OF FREE SPEECH IS IS TO LISTEN AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A RESPECTFUL DISPUTE DEBATE UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT WERE SEEN BUT I DO WANT TO CLARIFY DID NOT LEAD WITH SAYING. THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE UNDER ATTACK I SAID THAT I SPEECH IT UP FREE SPEECH IS ALIVE AND WELL AND WE'VE SEEN MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN ON OUR. COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND I ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE I. AS I NOTED THERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO SPEAK OUT I THINK SOME OF THE FEAR HAS BEEN ESCALATION AND THAT THESE AREN'T TURNING. JEALOUS DISCUSSIONS BUT MORE RELATED TO VIOLENCE AND THAT'S WHERE WE AGREE I CERTAINLY A WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. HERE SPEAKERS THEY WANT TO HEAR OR NOT HERE MUST THEY DON'T WANT TO THAT'S ALSO A CHOICE THEY HAVE MUCH TO ESCALATE INTO VIOLENCE OR SHUTTING SOMETHING DOWN JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE. WITH THE TOPIC CERTAINLY THAT'S WHERE I AGREE WITH YOU SO IT'S A COMPLEX TOPIC AGAIN I WISH WE HAD MORE OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE. RIGHT NOW TO DISCUSS SAID AND. BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT. FORWARD. NUMBER TO GO TO. DOCTOR FRENCH AND IF YOU WOULD. IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND I'M CALLING YOU HERE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF YOU SEE AND IF YOU COULD. TRIED TO CLARIFY UC'S POLICIES IN REGARDS TO. CHRIS SPEECH IF YOU CAN'T. Q.. KAREN FRIEND I'M OF LEGISLATIVE. AFFAIRS OF BOARD UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE DONE SOME WORK ON THE FREE SPEECH ISSUES I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT. OF A FREE SPEECH LAWYER. AND. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC INSTANCES ON THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS. IN TERMS OF FACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED. WORD AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. LOOK THERE'S LITIGATION ON THE ISSUE SO. PALM. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE UC POLICIES. HAVE BEEN EVOLVING OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT THE GOAL. HAS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE. DEAD WE CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND IF THAT. OUR CAMPUSES ARE NOT WIDE OPEN WITH EVERY PUBLIC SPACE THERE ARE AREAS OF THE CAMPUSES THAT OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC FORUMS AND WE HAVE. TIME SPACE AND MANNER. RESTRICTIONS THAT CAN BE IMPOSED. WHERE? THE GENERAL POLICY ON ON DAHLE. THE. SHOULDN'T EVENT BE SHUT DOWN IS WHERE THERE'S A. IMMINENT PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT. AND WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE SAFETY OF. OUR EMPLOYEES OUR STUDENTS ARE FACULTY AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECOME ON THE CAMPUSES. THANK YOU. NOT SEEN ANY OTHER WITNESSES EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT. MELENDEZ. YES I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. THANK YOU MEMBER QUIRK SILVA FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE THAT I WISH THERE WERE MORE DISCUSSION TODAY ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. DOCTOR FRENCH'S. COMMENTS WERE A BIT SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UC'S I'M THE CSU SYSTEM YOU SEE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY WERE NEUTRAL ON THIS ISSUE SO. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN THEY'RE LOBBYIST COMES FORWARD AND WITH SEVEN COMMENTS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN MY OFFICE BUT. BE THAT AS IT MAY. I THINK. I I THINK DOCTOR FRENCH AND AND NOW WE'D HEAR SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SHE SEEMS. I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HER TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM MY STUDENTS THERE AND PERHAPS YOU CAN PASS THAT ON TO. AND DOES THE OTHER MEMBERS AT THE UC'S ADAM BOARD THAT WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON SO BUT I APPRECIATE THAT DAVINCI CAME FOR AT LEAST. AND EXPRESSED POINT OF VIEW. HERE'S THE DEAL. OKAY. WELL. PEOPLE CAN SAY ALL DAY LONG THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THEY CAN SAY THAT TO LOOKOUTS COME HOME IN THE DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT ON EVERY CAMPUS THERE'S SOME CAMPUSES ARE HANDLING THIS JUST FINE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IN THE THEY HAVE NO PROBLEMS. THERE ARE OTHER CAMPUS CAMPUSES LIKE UC BERKELEY THEY'RE HAVING GREAT GREAT DIFFICULTY AT ALLOWING ALL STUDENTS TO EXERCISE THEIR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT HERE. A BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY THIS IS THE SITUATION THAT EXISTS FOR MY CHILDREN UMP FOR YOUR CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE AND THE LAST THING I THINK WE NEED TO DO. IS PUT THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY FEEL THAT THEY SPEAK UP. THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARMED AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. THAT'S. GO TALK TO SOME OF THESE COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT'S STORY AFTER STORY AFTER STORY HAS BEEN DONE TEACHERS ARE NOW CHANGING THE CURRICULUM SO THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO READ A PARTICULAR TAX OR AT LEAST. PASSAGES FROM ATTACKS BECAUSE IT'S OFFENSIVE TO THE STUDENTS THESE OR TALKING ABOUT. CLASSICAL LITERATURE HERE OKAY WEEK. ONE WHAT ARE WE DOING TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WE ARE SENDING THEM THERE TO LEARN OR SENDING THEIR TO MATURE WERE SENDING THEIR TO NOT ONLY LEARN AND THE. BIGGEST SKILLS AND GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED FOR A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY BUT TO MATURE AS ADULTS THEY CAN'T DO THAT IF WE ARE. WRAPPING THEM IN A NICE WARM BLANKET AND SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THAT IN ANYTHING THAT'S OFFENSIVE TO YOU. ARE YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH OR YOU DON'T AGREE WITH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO AND NOR DOES ANYONE ELSE GET TO LISTEN TO. THEY DON'T GROW THAT WAY THEY DO NOT GROW IN MISTER CHAIRMAN OF ALL PEOPLE MY GOODNESS COMING FROM EDUCATION YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE. YOU HAVE TO THE THE BRAIN HAS TO BE EXERCISED A HAS TO BE CHALLENGING THE HOUSES SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND WHY. AND I'M ASKING YOU THOUGH THERE WAS NOT MUCH DISCUSSION TODAY. I AM ASKING YOU TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ENTIRE GENERATION THOUSANDS. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING INTO THE WORKFORCE AND OUT INTO THE WORLD AND HAVE NO IDEA. HOW TO HOW TO ADDRESS IN AMMAN CITY HOW TO DEAL WITH SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH? WITH HIM YOU DON'T AGREE. OR WHO HAS IDEAS THAT YOU FLATLY REFUSED WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE GOING TO END UP AS A SOCIETY IF WE JUST WALL EACH OTHER OFF YOU GO IN THIS CORNER YOU BELIEVE THIS YOU GO ON THAT CORNER AND YOU BELIEVE THAT AND. NEVER SHOT WE COME TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE AND MEET. THAT'S THAT'S JUST BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD FUTURE FOR US FOR AS CALIFORNIANS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK REWRITE VOTE. THANK YOU. BUT I I WANNA THANK. MISS QUICKSILVER FOR HER COMMENTS AND FOR THE WITNESSES AND YOUR DISCUSSION. AND YOU ALLUDED TO ME AS AN EDUCATOR SIGH I WANNA RESPOND LITTLE BIT AS AN EDUCATOR. AND THAT IS THAT AS A TEACHER. AND I KEEP SAYING THE NUMBER. OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN MY CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE I NEVER BACKED AWAY. FROM KNOWLEDGE NEVER. RIGHT WHETHER IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL TAX. CONTROVERSIAL LANGUAGE IN THE TEXT. YOU KNOW. PRESENTED TO STUDENTS. AS IT WAS. AS THE TAX WAS HISTORY DOESN'T NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. RIGHT PRESENTED TO STUDENTS IT IS AND STUDENTS. MY EXPERIENCE STUDENTS. I HAVE A CRITICAL MIND. THAT ARE ABLE IN THE CLASSROOM TO ANALYZE AND LOOK AT. FACTS AND OPINIONS AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE. WE LIVE AND AN OPEN SOCIETY. WERE I DO BELIEVE. BECAUSE I I FEEL IT. EXPERIENCE IT EVERYDAY. AS OTHERS HERE I THINK WOULD AS WELL. THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY. IN THE METS OF FOLKS WHO AGREE WITH SOME OF OUR OPINIONS BUT DISAGREE WITH OTHERS. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T SHY AWAY. FROM LISTENING OR HEARING OR OF BEING IN CONTACT. A EVEN WITH OPINIONS THAT I DISAGREE WITH AND. YOU KNOW AS AN INDIVIDUAL WE WE COME INTO CONTACT THAT WITH THOSE. AS FAR AS FREE SPEECH. BUT I I BELIEVE AS YOU DO THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARE. IS AN IMPORTANT. I GUARANTEE TO OUR FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY. SO MUCH SO. THAT YOU NO OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY NOT THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY BUT SO MUCH SO. THAT. AS MS QUIRK SILVA POINTED OUT. WHEN. NEO* CAME TO MY CITY. NOT FAR FROM MY OWN HOME. AND WE'RE ABLE TO MARCH IN FRONT. OF. OUR LOCAL SYNAGOGUE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. DURING SERVICE THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. AND THAT THEY HAD THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DO THAT. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE USING AN EXAMPLE OF OF A GROUP WHERE ARE A. THAT I JUST VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH. BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE BOTH THE RIGHT AND THAT WE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS. UNPOPULAR IDEAS AND BELIEFS. SAME GROUP WENT AND. PROTESTED IN FRONT OF THE. A DAY CARE RAMPS ARE THESE THE. DAY LABOR. WHERE DAY LABORERS GATHER AND THE NEO* WENT TO? PROTESTS THERE. HUNDREDS. OF PEOPLE CAME OUT ENCOUNTER PROTESTS BUT AGAIN. THEY WERE ALLOWED. TO SPEAK A IN IN THE CITY AND SO THEY SHOULD. I MAY DISAGREE WITH YOUR PREMISE. THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS. IN DANGER. IN OUR UNIVERSITIES CAMPUSES. AND THAT WE MAY JUST DISAGREE. DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. AND AGAIN AS AN EDUCATOR I BELIEVE AND. ALLOWING IN CLASSES. OUTSIDE OF CLASSES FOR STUDENTS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS AND DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU AND THE VALUE OF STUDENTS HEARING DIFFERENT OPINIONS. BUT AS IT GOES TO THIS BILL. I I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO ENSURE. STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE REASON FOR I FIND THE BILL TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE. AND I BELIEVE OF ENACTED IT WOULD RESULT IN TOO MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ADDITIONALLY IS NOT THE PRACTICE OF THIS COMMITTED TO PASS OUT TO BILLS. TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE AND A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE'RE GONNA HEAR A. B. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FOUR. WHICH I FIND TO BE BETTER POLICY FOR APPROACHING. ADDRESSING FREEDOMS SPEECH ON OUR CAMPUSES SO I WON'T AT THIS TIME BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU COULD CALL THE ROLL. WE DON'T HAVE A CORE. BUT THANK YOU FREER PRESENTATION. AND WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL WHEN WE HAVE A CORE. NEXT ITEM. I DON'T THIRTEEN. WE HAVE THE AUTHOR. YES THURMOND. WELCOME.

IN CALIFORNIA FOR FIFTY YEARS AHMED APPLIES TO STATE AND LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT THIS IS NOT EXTENDED TO OUR FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE FIREFIGHTERS TO WORK AT A MOST OF THE TIME THE MILITARY BASES FOR EXAMPLE CAMP PENDLETON DOWN IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS BILL. IS IMPORTANT I THINK YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. THERE'S NO BETTER EXAMPLE ABOUT THEM THE RECENT FIRES FROM THE FALL AND WINTER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE. TUITION WAIVER THAT IS AFFORDED TO THE FAMILIES OF OUR STATE AND LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS ALSO AFFORDED TO OUR FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS AND FOR THOSE REASONS YOU ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I MISTER CHAIRMAN MANY BEERS FOR PLAIN SAN JOSE EVER WHICH DO WE DON'T WE'RE WAITING FOR A QUORUM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER BONTA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY OB I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR THE FAMILIES OF FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS TO TO REMEDY A. ARM AT A CURRENT. THE FACT IN THE LAW AND THIS WITH A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO THE FAMILIES AND. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND BELIEVE THE SURVIVORS OF FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFITS AS THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE A LOOK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF. WE'RE GONNA GO OUT OF ORDER. AND A CALL OF. PATTERSON ITEM FOURTEEN. SO THAT HIS STUDENTS CAN. THE UPPER. SO ITEM FOURTEEN A. B. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE. I CAN. APPRECIATE THAT. YEAH. AND TO MISTER HARBOR IS WELL BURKE FOR FACILITATING AS WELL THANK YOU. IT WILL BE WILL BE QUICK OUT. THE OFFER SO I OP APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A S. SUPPORT SUPPORT BILL HERE. ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. THE CHAIRMAN TO THE STAFF AND OTHERS FOR WORKING THROUGH THIS. BOB BUT THAT UP VERY QUICKLY YET CURRENT LAW PROVIDESCAL GRANTS INFILL GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND FEDERAL STUDENT. A COMMISSION EACH INSTITUTION HAS DISCRETION TO VOLUNTARILY. PARTICIPATE IN THE CAL GRANT TELL GRANT PROGRAMS AND UPON RECEIVING THE GRANT FUNDS ITS RESPONSIBILITY UNIVERSITY TO DISTRIBUTE. THE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE STUDENTS. FOUND HOWEVER. FOR SOME ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND WE'LL HEAR. FROM SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM PRESENT STATE STUDENTS. THEY RECEIVED PELL GRANT A CAL GRANT FUNDS AFTER THE START OF INSTRUCTION. MANY THEY MAY NOT RECEIVE THEIR SYSTEMS FOR COSTLY TEXTBOOKS UNTIL. WEEKS AFTER THEIR SEMESTER BEGINS. IT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD REQUIRED READING INSTRUCTION MATERIALS FOR THEIR ROLLED. CLASSES AB. ABOUT TWO FIVE SIX THREE SIX TO AID STUDENTS WHO FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY. BY REQUIRING UNIVERSITIES TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO STUDENTS. THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING REQUIRED BOOKS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AT LEAST ONE WEEK BEFORE THE START OF CLASSES. THE BOOKSTORE WOULD REPORT BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT. USED BY THE STUDENT THE AMOUNT USED BY THE STUDENT WOULD THEN BE CREDIT AGAINST THEIR INCOMING. GRANT FUNDS ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A STUDENT IS SET TO RECEIVE FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AFTER ONE SEMESTER THEY USED TO HAVE IT AT THE BOOKSTORE DEAL WHERE THEY WILL SUBSEQUENT RECEIVES THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM A SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROJECT IN SANTA ANA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE SEEK TO EXPAND THIS FOR ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE DELAYED FROM RECEIVING ANY FORM OF FUNDING ADMINISTERED BY THOSE UNIVERSITIES THAT PARTICIPATE INSTATE FEDERAL GRANT. FUNDING PROGRAMS. ALSO. DO APPRECIATE THE. INTEREST IN THE CAN THE COMMITTEE AND THE WORK AND. ACTUALLY MAKING THIS A MUCH MUCH BETTER BILL QUITE FRANKLY THAN I ORIGINAL INTENTION. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT AS WELL. UP TO HAVE WITH ME SEBASTIAN. BUT WHEN THREE A CURRENT STUDENT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRIEND UP PRESIDENT EMERITUS SO SHE'D STUDENTS INCORPORATED CLUB HE'S HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SOME A MENTOR AYE PATTERSON APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK WITH YOU. UP MY NAME IS SEBASTIAN WENT THE I'M A THIRD YEAR STUDENT AT FRESNO STATE I'M ALSO AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE PARTS OF OUR STUDENT BODY GOVERNMENT. AND DURING THE THREE YEARS THAT I SPENT IN OUR STUDENT BODY GOVERNMENT ONE OF THE. BIGGEST ISSUES THAT I WAS HER COMPLAINTS ABOUT AND ONE OF THE MOST. ANNOYING ISSUES FOR STUDENTS IS THE TARDINESS OF FINANCIAL AID PAYMENTS AS WELL AS NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A CERTAIN ITEMS THAT AT THAT THE SCHOOL AND SO. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IMPACTS STUDENTS A RATHER NEGATIVELY AND WHY I SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE. I I BELIEVE THAT. AT AT FRESNO STATE WE REALLY DO HAVE EIGHTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO RELY PARTLY AT LEAST ON FINANCIAL AID ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. WHO RELY ENTIRELY ON FINANCIAL AID IN ORDER TO A PURCHASE THEIR BOOKS AS WELL AS PAY FOR THEIR TUITION AND OTHER THINGS? I'M UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THEY RELY ON A SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO. CONSISTENTLY DELIVER PAYMENTS ON TIME AND THAT. THAT SYSTEM FAILS THEM THEN THEY'RE STUCK OUT WITH BILLS THEY CAN'T PAY AND SO WE HAVE TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHEN THAT HAPPENS. UP THIS BILL WOULD OPEN A LINE OF CREDIT FOR STUDENTS AT THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORES AND ALLOW THEM TO PURCHASE THE MATERIALS THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN CLASS OUT THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO NOT GET BEHIND IN CLASS IT WOULD. GET RID OF THOSE FINANCIAL WORRIES AND THAT REALLY UNDUE STRESS FOR SOME STUDENTS WERE WORKING JOBS OR ALL THE DIFFERENT STRESSES THAT COME WITH COLLEGE LIFE IN ADDITION FINANCING THAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OUR SYSTEM IS REALLY IN PERFECT BUT EACH DAY WE HAVE TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THIS IS A SMALL STEP BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR STUDENTS THAT WILL HELP COUNTLESS UP. STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. ALL OVER THE STATE. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOPE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS. I I WANT TO THANK THE STUDENTS. AND MISTER PATTERSON FOR BRINGING FORWARD WHAT I THINK IS A VERY GOOD COMMON SENSE. APPROACH. AND DOESN'T LIKE THE STUDENTS SAID THAT THIS WILL HELP. STUDENTS HAVE MORE AXES QUICKER. TWO BOOKS THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR CLASSES ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THAT'LL FOR A CRESCENTA AND ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE A CLOSER. WE'LL GO TO ITEM NUMBER THREE MISTER HARPER. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE NINETY ONE. THAT'S ACTUALLY ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN. WELCOME MISTER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK IT TO THE I COMMITTEE FOUGHT FOR HEARING THIS ISSUE. THESE SET OF ISSUES WHICH I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT TO MENTAL HEALTH. EYES WILL A SUICIDE. TODAY I'M HERE PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE. TWENTY THREE NINETY ONE WHICH REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNICABLE GE'S AND REQUEST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE HIGHER LEARNING INSTITUTIONS. TO INCLUDE THE PHONE NUMBERS FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION AND PUBLIC SAFETY ON STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ENRICHING ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS YET GOING TO COLLEGE CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR MANY STUDENTS SINCE IS THE FIRST TIME THAT MANY ARE OFTEN LIVING ON THEIR OWN. IN ADDITION TO THE STRESS OF MAINTAINING A GOOD GPA AND BEING ON THEIR OWN. MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS CONTEND WITH THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOME STUDENTS HAVE TROUBLE PAYING THE RENT STRUGGLING WITH FOOD AND SECURITY. OR EVEN BEING ABLE FOUR TO COAT OUGHT TO BE ABLE STAY WARM IN THE WINTER. OTHER STUDENTS DEAL WITH THE PAIN OF BEING A VICTIM OF A CRIME ON CAMPUS. TRAGICALLY MORE STATEMENT MORE STUDENTS ARE FEELING THAT THE PERMIT SOLUTION TO DEALING WITH LIFE'S TEMPORARY PROBLEMS. TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE. SUICIDE IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AGED TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR. AND THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS. BY INCLUDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND PUBLIC SAFETY PHONE NUMBERS ON STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS WE GET EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT CALIFORNIA PLACE TO TURN. WHEN THEY NEED HELP. THERE ARE TWO EFFECTIVE PHONE NUMBER STUDENTS CAN USE TO HELP GET. TO HELP HANDLING THE STRESS OF COLLEGE. AND OFTEN YOUNG LIFE. FOR STUDENTS WHIP OUR PREFERRED A TEXT ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS THERE'S A CRISIS TEXT LINE. WHICH IS A FREE CONTROVERSY LA CONFIDENTIAL TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPPORT SERVICE THAT STUDENTS CAN CONTACT ANYTIME VIA TEXT. OFTEN THE PREFERRED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATION AMONG MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. FOR THOSE WHO PREFER TO TALK ON THE PHONE OLD SCHOOL LIKE MYSELF. THERE IS A NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. WHICH PROVIDES FREE AND CONFIDENTIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO PEOPLE IN SUICIDAL CRISIS OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION HAVING A PHONE NUMBER CAMPUS POLICE OR A LOCAL NON EMERGENCY NUMBER GIVES STUDENTS A DIRECT LINE. TO PROTECTION AND HELP WHENEVER THEY NEED IT. THIS BILL IS NEEDED SO STUDENTS HAVE A VALUABLE RESOURCE TO TURN TO WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS LEFT. WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE NINETY ONE. IS CORDONED AUDI OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND DANIEL SABINO FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNIST SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION IS THE NATION'S LARGEST FOUNDATION DEALING WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND ALSO THE LARGEST FUNDER OF RESEARCH. S. HE SAID I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE GREATER SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA CHAPTER OF A FSP. I ALSO SERVE ON TO THEIR NATIONAL COUNCILS. I'VE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH POLICY WORK GROUP. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO'S OPPRESSION CENTER ADVISORY BOARD. AND THREE COUNTY SUICIDE PREVENTION COMMITTEES. FOURTEEN YEARS AGO THIS COMING FALL THE SOCK COMING OCTOBER. MY DAUGHTER A COLLEGE FRESHMAN TOOK HER LIFE. AMANDA HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION SINCE THE AGE OF TEN. AND SOMETHING HAPPENED IN HER FRESHMAN YEAR. THAT. DELGADO TO TAKE HER LIFE. I TRULY BELIEVE ALTHOUGH I CAN'T UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT IT. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HAD SHE HAD INFORMATION ON HER STUDENT D CARD. FOR RESOURCES THAT IT WOULD OF POLICE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR HER TO REACH OUT TO GET HELP IN THAT TIME OF CRISIS. ELSE WE'VE JUST HEARD. THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF SUICIDES AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS SUSPEND THEIR SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR QUITE AWHILE NOW. SUICIDE ITSELF NATIONALLY IS A TEMPLATING CAUSE OF DEATH THAT HAS BEEN SO. FOR THE LAST DECADE. AND IT'S INCREASED EVERY YEAR. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. TO TURN THAT AROUND. I DO BELIEVE WHOLE HEARTEDLY THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES. STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED TWO SEVEN THREE TALK NUMBER THE NATIONAL LIFELINE NUMBER. IT WILL REVERT BACK TO THE CLOSEST CRISIS CENTER. FOR THE NUMBER THAT THEY CALLED FOR. SO IF THEY'RE IN AND NINE ONE SIX AREA CODE. IT'LL COME BACK TO THE CRISIS CENTER HERE. OKAY IF THEY'RE IN THE BAY AREA IT'LL GO BACK TO THAT CRISIS AND. STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARD FOR X.. STUDENTS ARE VERY EXTENSIVELY USED ON CAMPUSES VARIETY OF THINGS SUCH AS FOOD PURCHASES DISCOUNT TICKETS LIBRARY IT'S REALLY THERE. THEIR LIFE LINK. AND IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT TO THEIR. STUDENT CAMPUS LIFE. BY HAVING THOSE PHONE NUMBERS NONE THE CRISIS FLANK. READILY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS CAN HELP SAVE LIVES. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS BE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO SAY ONE OF THOSE LIES WE DO KNOW FOR EVERY LIFE THAT'S LOS TO SUICIDE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE ATTEMPTS. THANK YOU. DANIEL SO THE NO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE NONPROFIT REGIONAL CENTERS AMONG OTHER THINGS COORDINATE SERVICES FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. INCLUDING HONORABLE CHAIR IN YOUR DISTRICT A INLAND REGIONAL CENTER. REALLY WORTH NOTING THAT A RECENT STUDIES ON THIS ARE STILL. DIGGING IN TO THE QUESTION OF THE CORRELATIONS THAT RELATE TO TO DEVELOP ALISON YLIDES AND BULLYING BUT. LOST TWENTY THIRTEEN OF. PUBLICATION IN RESEARCHING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS FINDS A MASSIVELY HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY WITH AUTISM. HAVING SUICIDAL IDEATION OR ATTEMPTS A THE CORAL ITS THAT. COME INTO PLAY HERE INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS BULLYING AND WELL WE KNOW THAT BULLYING DOESN'T STOP ONCE YOU LEAVE. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IT CAN PURCHASE FOR YEARS AND THE CAUSES OF THAT. I DON'T CHANGE EITHER PULLING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THEREFORE IS EMINENTLY REASONABLE TO ASSUME AS. A LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RISK OF SUICIDE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO TO SEE SOMEONE WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY IN OUR SYSTEM MANAGED TO ATTAIN COLLEGE ENTRANCE BUT REALLY ONE OF THE GOLD STANDARDS OF A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO SEE SOMEONE AND UP IN A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. TO HAVE THEM AT THAT HEIGHTENED RISK AND NOT HAVE AN OPTION. A PLACE TO TURN TO SUCH AS A PHONE NUMBER ON A STUDENT ID THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY STUDENT CARRIES ALMOST ALL THE TIME. EYES AGAIN A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT VERY SIMPLY CRATES ACCESS TO THAT. OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT. LIKE IT'S ON A PERSONAL LEVEL A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. A KILLED HIMSELF SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS PRIOR. AND THERE'S ALWAYS PART OF ME THAT WONDERS IF. HE HAD HAD. A A NUMBER. IF THERE IS SOMETHING MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE FOR HIM. WOULD HE STILL BE HERE. IT'S A QUESTION THAT I HOPE THAT NOBODY AT ALL TO EVER HAVE HOUSE HAS TO ASK AND. I THINK THIS BILL IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO HELP CREATE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO REACH OUT IN THAT MOMENT OF CRISIS. RICHARD STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR IOSCO FOR COULD I'M A PEDIATRICIAN SAN FRANCISCO SPEAKING FOR AP CALIFORNIA THAT REPRESENTS FIVE THOUSAND PEDIATRICIANS ACROSS THE STATE. AYE WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. EIGHT YOUR HONOR ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SOUND PUBLIC POLICY IN THE AREA BRING HEALTH WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IT'S QUIRK SILVA. GONNA BE MISSED TALKIE TODAY NO I I DO LIKE THIS BILL IT'S IT'S. YOU KNOW NOT A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST THE INFORMATION AND AS YOU. NOTE UP WE HAVE MANY STUDENTS WHO LEAVE HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CAN FILL VERY VERY ISOLATED AND. WITH THAT CAN COME DEPRESSION ANOTHER THING SO BEING ABLETO HAVE SOME TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE USING REGULARLY I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD. A WAY FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT THERE'S. UP HELP OUT THERE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP. NO OTHER COMMENTS. MISTER HARPER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT IN ANTICIPATION OF OTHERS MAY HAVE QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. AYE THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT. REQUIRES THE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING STOCK OR IF THERE WAS A STOCKPILE OF PREPRINTED PARTS OF ID'S. UP THIS SET A BILL HAS BEEN. ARE WRITTEN IN A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS THIS IS GOING FORWARD I INTENDED AS A STEP TO GO POOR BUT. YOUR IDEAS ON YOU ESPECIALLY AS A STUDENT UP ALL THE TIME. AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AT THE FINGERTIPS. AS A SAID BOTH TO BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO BE ABLE TO TAX. I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS WE CAN OUTREACH WELL IT WON'T SOLVE EVERY SUICIDE. OR POTENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. I THINK IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP I IN TERMS OF A STATE WITH THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. AND WITH THE LARGEST UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ARE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THAT. WE CAN OUTREACH TO A TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND TO BE ABLE HOW THAT RESOURCE AVAILABLE. IT ALSO DOESN'T SUPPLANT IF THERE'S AN EXISTING HOTLINE THAT SPECIFIC TO THAT CAMPUS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE. THIS DOES NOT DISTURB THAT EXISTING RELATIONSHIP FOR A EXISTING SITUATION AYE IT ALL SO I WOULD LIKE TO URGE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO PLEASE US SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. BY AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF KEEPING PEOPLE IN TOUCH AND BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. OF SUICIDE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS HARPER AYE I THINK I MAY HAVE FAILED DUE TO ASK THE QUESTION THAT YOU YOU HAD AGREED TO THE AMENDMENTS IS PRETTY I SAID AND AND. INITIALLY THAT I THINK YOU THE AND I VERY MUCH STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. HAVEN'T BEEN A COLLEGE STUDENT AND WITNESS. YOU KNOW THE THE HARD TIMES THAT SOME OF MY FELLOW STUDENTS. I HAD AND WE'VE HEARD FROM STUDENTS AT HOW DIFFICULT. IN A LACK OF A LITTLE HEALTH FACILITIES AND KNOWING OF PERSONALLY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO. HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AS MISS QUIRK SILVA SAID OF BEING FAR AWAY FROM HOME AND ISOLATED. I THINK THIS IS A A GREAT BILL THAT YOU BROUGHT FORWARD SOME VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN MANIC ADDITIONAL COMMENT IF I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ONE EIGHT HUNDRED TWO SEVEN THREE TALK. NUMBER AS WELL AS THAT THE TEXT LINE. IS AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN CRISIS TO USE THAT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT A FRIEND A FAMILY MEMBER. CALL AND GET ADVICE THANK YOU. WILL HOLD IT AND. WILL HAVE THE VOTE WHEN WE HAVE A COURT THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU. FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR. OF THE ARROW. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FORTY ONE. WELCOME. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FORTY ONE. WHICH URGES THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF YOU SEE INVESTMENTS WHICH MANAGES OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO ADOPT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POLICIES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY IN THE HIRING OF STAFF IN THE SELECTION OF INVESTMENT PARTNERS. WERE YOU SEE INVESTMENT. ACTS AS A LIMITED PARTNER PARTNER INVESTOR IN CAPITAL INVENTOR CAPITAL PRIVATE EQUITY LEVERAGED BUYOUTS AND OTHER FUNDS. FIRST I WANT OF KNOWLEDGE ALL BUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AMONGST ITS STUDENT POPULATION EMPLOYEES AND FACULTY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS LEVEL IS EXCELLING AT STUDENT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PRO PROGRAMS FIVE CAMPUSES ARE RECOGNIZED AS HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS. ANY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES RECEIVED THE HIGHER EDUCATION EXCELLENCE IN DIVERSITY AWARD FROM INSIGHT IN INTO INTO DIVERSITY MAGAZINE. DIVERSITY IN CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT AS HAS ALSO BEEN A FOCUS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND IN ITS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT. THE UNIVERSITY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE RATIO OF MINORITY STAFF IS LOWER AMONG SENIOR POSITIONS AND THE PROPORTION OF MINORITY ACADEMICS IS HIGHEST IN THE NON FACULTY POSITIONS. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINOS MAKE UP TWELVE PERCENT OF THE MANAGERS AND SENIOR PROFESSIONALS ACROSS ALL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR NEW CAMPUSES AND JUST SIX POINT SIX PERCENT OF NON FACULTY ACADEMICS. FROM LOOKING AT THE UC INVESTMENTS ONLINE STAFF DIRECT DIRECTORY IT APPEARS AT UC INVESTMENTS EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE PEOPLE NOW IT'S NOT SCIENTIFIC. BUT IT TELLS A STORY. OUT OF THOSE SIXTY THREE PEOPLE FORTY JOBS ARE PROFESSIONAL OR EXECUTIVE TYPE POSITIONS WITH SENIOR MANAGER DIRECTOR OFFICER CHIEF IN THE JOB TITLE. JUST SIX OF THE FORTY EXECUTIVE LEVEL JOBS ARE FILLED BY WOMEN. THIRTEEN WOMEN WORK AT THE UC INVESTMENTS IN TOTAL. AND THERE ARE FEW UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES LIKE VENUS ARE AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT WORK THERE. CLEARLY YOU SEE INVESTMENTS DOES NOT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY FROM THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND FACULTY EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS AND BOTH SHOW CHALLENGES TO IMPROVING REPRESENTATION FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS. HOWEVER I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SEE INVESTMENT DOES HAVE SOME VERY POSITIVE ELEMENTS TO ITS INVESTING STRATEGY. THEIR SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK SHOWS THAT THEY ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL FACTORS CAN BE SIX SUCCESSFULLY CONSIDERED IN ITS INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. AND AND AND A WOMAN INVESTMENT FELLOW REPRESENT TO YOU SEE INVESTMENTS IN THE THIRTY PERCENT COALITION WHICH INDICATES THAT THEY GRASP THE INHERENT VALUE INTO BURKE AND GENDER DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS. IN FACT THE UC REGENTS RECOGNIZE IN THE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CORPORATE DIVERSITY ARE PARTNERING WITH CAL STIRS ON THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE FIFTY COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT WOMEN ON THEIR CORPORATE BOARDS TO DIVORCE. DIVERSIFY THEIR BOARD MEMBERSHIP. WHICH IS WHY IT IS SURPRISING THAT YOU SEE INVESTMENTS HAS NOT YET ADOPTED AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY THATIMPRINT EMBRACES DIVERSITY. INTERNALLY NOR WORKS TO ENCOURAGE ITS INVESTMENT PARTNERS TO DO SO. THIS IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY. AB YOU SEE INVESTMENT SISTER ENTITIES WITH DECADES OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. THEY SHOULD BE LAUDED FOR THEIR EXPANSIVE INTERNAL DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PROGRAMS BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS IN THE INVESTMENT WORLD TO WOMEN AND UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES. THEY'RE LEADING THE WAY. THEY HAVE SPONSORED CORPORATE DIVERSITY BOB FUND MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVE TEAM MEMBERS THROUGH THEIR OWN HIRING PROCESS AS WELL. IF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS OPERATE WELL THEY OPERATE IS A FUND OF FUNDS PLACING INVESTMENTS IN AN ARRAY OF INVESTMENT TYPES AND WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUND MANAGERS. AB TWENTY FORTY ONE URGES THE REGENTS TO HAVE THE. CHAU MIMIC THE EMERGING FUND MANAGER PROGRAMS CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM IN INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BOTH BURKE FOR BETTER FINANCIAL OUTCOMES AND FOR IMMEDIATE RATING REST BOTH OF WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. A BOMB IN INVESTMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN UC VENTURES A COMPONENT OF YOU SEE INVESTMENT PUBLISHED ITS PROGRAM OVERVIEW INDICATING THE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS IT'D PARTNERED WITH AS OVER HERE AND CHECK YES CAN I INTERRUPT YOU FOR A SECOND SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. MEDINA PRESENT. BAKER ARAMBULA. BLOOM. CHAVEZ IRWIN KILEY STONE. LOW PATTERSON. QUIRK SILVA. SANTIAGO. WEBER. WE ARE NOW IN. A QUORUM PRESENT THEY CHECK YOU THINK IT WAS GOV WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. SO THE TREND AMONG LIMITED PARTNER INVESTORS HAS BEEN TO ENCOURAGE MORE DIVERSE GOVERNANCE BODIES IN INVESTMENT MANAGERS OR CORPORATE BOARDS FOR EARLY STAGE STARTUPS TO PUBLIC COMPANY BOOK COMPANY BOARDS THIS IS BECAUSE. DIVERSITY DRIVES BETTER CORPORATE PERFORMANCE AND THAT'S WHAT WORK WERE ALL ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN YOU SEE VENTURES A COMPONENT OF YOU SEE INVESTMENTS PUBLISHED ITS PROGRAM OVERVIEW. INDICATING THE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS AT A PARTNER WITH AS STRATEGIC PARTNERS AND IN A LOCAL FUND STRATEGY. THE PRINCIPLES OF EACH OF THOSE FUNDS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE UC VENTURES PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND A HUNDRED PERCENT ARE MALE. SURELY THE REGION'S CAN REQUEST THE SAME LEVEL OF ACTIVE COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WITHIN YOU SEE ITS OWN INVESTMENT OFFICE AS IT DOES TO COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE. CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE AND SURELY THE REGION'S CAN REQUEST THAT YOU SEE INVESTMENTS LAUNCH EMERGING FUND MANAGER PROGRAMS EQUAL TO HIS SISTER FINDS CALPERS AND CAL STIRS EFFORT. WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY ONE TODAY SHARON WINE BAR A PART PARTNER AT A WOMAN FOUNDED. SAN FRANCISCO BASED VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM AND JESSICA STRAUSS PAST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION AND A CURRENT COUGH KAUFMAN FELLOW. THANK YOU. PLEASE BEGIN. SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO. I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE START UP IN VENTURE CAPITAL ECOSYSTEM FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AS AN EXECUTIVE A C. E. O. OF ENTRY PAVEL INVESTOR IN A PRIVATE INVESTOR MY NAME IS SHARON ONE BAR. AND LAST WEEK TECHCRUNCH WHICH IS A LEADING BLOG ON TECHNOLOGY INVENTOR CAPITAL PUBLISHED AN OP ED THAT I WROTE WITH ADVICE TO LIMITED PARTNERS INVESTORS LIKE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENT OFFICE ON HOW THEY CAN. TAKE SIMPLE STEPS TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY IN BOTH THE MANAGERS THAT THEY BACK THE PARTNERS THAT THEY WORK WITH AS WELL AS THE COMPANIES IN WHICH THEY INVEST. TWENTY YEARS AGO VENTURE CAPITAL WAS A VERY SMALL CLOSED CLUB. OF A A LIMITED HAND FULL OF GUYS MAINLY WHO'D GONE TO STANFORD WORKING ON SAN TOLL ROAD INVESTING IN A SMALL GROUP OF ENTREPRENEURS. IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR BUSINESS THAT'S WHY WE'RE CALLED AND SILICON VALLEY. BUT TODAY THE VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND IT REFLECTS A MUCH BROADER SWATH OF AMERICAN ENTERPRISE IN FACT VENTURE BACKED COMPANIES. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TWENTY PERCENT OF THE GDP IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY SO IT REALLY TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. AND VC BACKED COMPANIES. ARE LEADING NOT ONLY IN IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CHANGING MARKETS BUT THEY'RE LEADING IN DIVERSITY. TODAY. SEVEN HUNDRED ENTREPRENEURS FROM SOME OF THE BEST START UPS IN THE U. S.. ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NOT TAKE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FROM FIRMS THAT WERE MADE UP ONLY OF WHITE MEN. THEY WANT AND THESE ENTREPRENEURS ARE NOT ALL WOMEN NOT ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR THERE. EVERY KIND OF ENTREPRENEUR. BUT THEY WANT TO SEE THE PARTNERS WHO ARE INVESTING WITH THEM AND HOPE IN THEIR COMPANIES GROW REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE MARKETS THAT THEY SERVE. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT MANAGER PARTNER LIST IS EXCLUSIVELY WHITE MEN TODAY'S SO THEY'RE CUT OFF FROM OF THE IS BEST ENTREPRENEURS. IN ADDITION AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COUNTY ARE SAID. THE SISTER ORGANIZATIONS CALPERS AND HOLSTERS HAVE REALLY LED THE WAY FOR SHOWING HOW LIMITED PARTNERS CAN CREATE PROGRAMS WITHOUT IMPLEMENTING QUOTAS. THAT LEAD TO NOT ONLY GREAT DIVERSITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT PARTNERS AND COMPANIES BUT GREAT RETURNS. AND IT'S REALLY THE THE SEEKING OF RETURNS THAT HOPES DRIVE UP THIS CHANGE THAT'S HAPPENING SO WE URGE THE UNIVERSE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT THE MEASURES THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. IS PROPOSING TO REALLY GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THE BEST KINDS OF COMPANIES AND TO HELP REFLECT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE ALL LIVING IN. THANK YOU. AT THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STRAUSS. I HAVE SPENT THE PAST TEN YEARS OF THE INTERSECTION OF PUBLIC POLICY AND INNOVATION WORKING IN THE US CONGRESS AND. MORE RECENTLY WITH THE NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION THE TRADE GROUP REPRESENTING U. S. VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTORS. WHERE WE WORK TOGETHER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO LAUNCH THE FIRST DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVE FOR THE VENTURE INDUSTRY? AND THEN WHEN WE DID THAT. WE PARTNERED TOGETHER WITH FORTY VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS MANY OF THEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO LAUNCH A DIVERSITY PLEDGE. TO PLEDGE TO DO MORE TO CHANGE HIRING PRACTICES WITHIN VENTURE FIRMS AND TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT ON THE DIVERSITY STATISTICS WITHIN THE FIRMS AND ITS THAT SPIRIT THAT REALLY GUIDES. THIS BILL A. B. ON TWENTY FORTY ONE. SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO WHICH ADDRESSES A KEY CHALLENGE THAT'S FACING OUR VIBRANT INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE LACK OF DIVERSITY AND VENTURE. AND MORE BROADLY THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PLAY IN ADVANCING DIVERSITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL. BUDGET CAPITALIST HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STEWARDING INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL IN ORDER TO BENEFIT OF. THE STATE IN THIS CASE THE UC SYSTEM ITS CONSTITUENTS THROUGH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION AND VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE VERY FEW IN NUMBER THEIR NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS. IN THE U. S. AND. ONLY ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE PARTNERS OF THOSE FIRMS ARE WOMEN AND FEWER THAN TWO PERCENT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEREFORE WITH THIS LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS TO LEARN HOW TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED DIVERSITY OF THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO SAID. DRIVE INNOVATION BOTH THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ANSWER INCREASE REVENUE. SO IT'S IT'S MY BELIEF THAT ON THE PATH TOWARD CHANGE IS PARTNERSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL AB TWENTY FORTY ONE REALLY SUCCEEDS IN DOING. YOU SEE VENTURES ON THE BROADER UC SYSTEM CAN DO MUCH MORE TO TAKE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT OUR DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE CALIFORNIA INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM. BENEFITS YOU SEE STAKEHOLDERS TO A GREATER EXTENT. AND IT IS ABOUT. NOTION THAT YOU SEE VENTURES CAN CAN DO MORE TO BOTH BENEFIT. I'M COULD BE VENTURE CAPITALISTS OF THE QUALIFIED MEN AND WOMEN. COLOR WHO COULD BE MANAGING THE. UC'S INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL TO BENEFIT AND THE STATE AND ITS CONSTITUENTS. SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY HAS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY CALIFORNIA IS THE HEART OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL ECOSYSTEM IN THE WORLD. THE STATE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS IN THE STATE MANAGE MORE INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL THEN FIRMS IN ANY OTHER STATE AND DEPLOY MORE INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL TO START UPS IN THE STATE. THEREFORE BY TAKING ACTION AND. MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS BILL I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE RIGHT COMMON SENSE STEPS. TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UC VENTURES AND ITS UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO TOWARD GREATER DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. SO. MATT ASK YOU I I BELIEVE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING TWO MINUTES TO WITNESSES THAT I DID HAVE MY TIMER HERE BUT I. THANK YOU. FOR THAT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISS GOVERNOR OR WE HAVE WITNESSES AND. TWEETERS. WINNERS COME ON UP. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT OPPOSED THIS BILL. WELL GUESS WE ARE TWEENER IN THE GREATEST SINCE THE WORD. WE DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD THEY TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND ARE I THINK. LOOK FORWARD THIRTEEN TO HAVE THIS BE A CONVERSATION STARTER FOR US WITH RESPECT TO. THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FACT I THINK IN IN LIGHT OF THE. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WE FACE HERE. WE WANT TO BRING OUR KEY FOLKS FROM THE UC OFFICE OF THE CIO HERE TODAY TO SPEAK WITH YOU DIRECTLY ABOUT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE. UNDER WAY WITHIN THAT OFFICE AND I LIKE TO TRANSFERRED OVER FIGHT COULD. THE BALANCE OF MY TIME TO MY COLLEAGUE. ARTICLE MARRIES FROM THE OC I WAS OFFICE HE'S A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THE FURTHER SHARE SOME OF THOSE PERSPECTIVES AND VIEWPOINTS. THANK YOU AN APOLOGY TO HAVE MY BACK TO YOU BUT.

MY NAME'S ARTHUR THE BETA DIMINISH I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF WHAT I'LL CALL YOU SEE INVESTMENTS. I LIKE START TO BEGIN. SAY THAT WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION NOT SIMPLY AS IT PERTAINS TO OUR OFFICE BUT AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SO WHO IS ARE OFFICE WE MANAGE A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF OUR PENSIONERS ARE RETIREMENT SAVERS. ARE FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED ENDOWMENTS AS WELL AS OUR TEN CAMPUSES AND FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS. OUR STAFF IS SIXTY PEOPLE TO BE VERY CLEAR WE ARE SMALL THAT'S BY DESIGN. WE. GIVING CREDIT TO MISS CABALLERO WE ARE FIFTY THREE PERCENT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES BUT THE BALANCE THE STRONG BALANCE OF THAT. WOULD BE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. BUT ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. OR HIRING PRACTICES VERY MUCH ALIGNED WE ARE PART OF THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IT'S OR HIRING PRACTICES ALIGNED WITH OUR HUMAN RESOURCES TEAM WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR. POLICY AND PRACTICE AS IT PERTAINS TO. HIRING AND DIVERSITY IN THE DIVERSITY OF POOLS. I'D LIKE TO JUST HAVE AND I KNOW MY TIME IS LIMITED BUT I'D LIKE TO HAND THIS OUT AND AGAIN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COVER YOUR FOR POINTING IT OUT. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE CAME OUT WITH OUR SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK. OUR CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER JAGDEEP SING THE CHAIR. STARTED ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO THE DATE AND WITHIN A YEAR HE HAD WORKED WITH UC REGENTS TO. BASICALLY COME UP WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK. I AM INTERESTED TIME I'LL JUST POINT OUT PAGE TWELVE VERY CLEARLY. POINTS OUT DIVERSITY AS A KEY VALUE. PACIFIC CLEARLY SAY. DIVERSITY ENHANCES ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES FOR BUSINESS AND SOCIETY. THAT IS AN INTERNAL VIEW OF WHAT WE DO EXTERNALLY. AS POINTED OUT BY ASSEMBLY PERSON COVER EUROPE WE WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION WE ARE ON THE THIRTY PERCENT. WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM IN AN INTERESTING STAT IS IN THEIR WORK SINCE TWENTY TWELVE. HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN IN COMPANIES THEY'VE ENGAGE WITH HAVE NOW BEEN ELECTED TO THAT BOARD. PROXY VOTING IS SOMETHING WE DON'T OFTEN TALK ABOUT BUT I WANNA SPEND A MINUTE BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND YOU GET YOUR OWN CONSTITUENTS TO COME A REMIND YOU KNOW YOU ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES SO I'LL BE QUICK. WE OWN FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE PUBLIC EQUITY. EACH OF THOSE SHARES GIVE US ABILITY TO VOTE. SO IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US IN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TO VOTE PROPERLY. WE VOTE WITH AN INSTITUTION CALL I ASSESS WHO MANAGES OUR PROXY VOTING. AND WE USE A WHAT'S CALLED SR I SUSTAINABLE. INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK AND WHAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OF THAT IS THAT IN THIS YEAR PROXY SEASON IS COMING UP THEY'VE CHANGED THE WAY THEY VOTED. FOR BOARDS SO IF THERE'S NOT A WOMEN. AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY AND THIRTY PERCENT ON THAT BOARD THEY WILL VOTE NO. WE WILL VOTE NO IF THERE'S NOT DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND AND TO SHARE SOME FEEDBACK AND. THAT MAY BE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ONE POINT IS CLEARLY IT EXTENDS. MOST OF OUR MANAGER OUTSIDE CALLS. CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE EXTENDING BEYOND OUR JURISDICTION AND THE ABILITY TO PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENT THAT MAY BE CHALLENGING. AS POINTED OUT BY THE SPEAKERS THIS BILL TARGETS VENTURE CAPITAL. WHICH WE AGREE WITH THERE IS A A PROBLEM IN VENTURE CAPITAL VENTURE CAPITAL OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AND ALL THOSE MANAGERS THIRTY PERCENT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES. LET ME JUST CLOSE WITH SAYING THAT TO BE CLEAR WE BELIEVE DIVERSITY INCLUSION MATTERS. WE FEEL THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE AT THE LEADING EDGE AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE DON'T KNOW THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE MANAGE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WITH SIXTY PEOPLE. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS PER INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL VERSUS AN INDUSTRY AVERAGE OF ONE WE DO ALL THAT FOR THREE BASIS POINTS THAT ZERO POINT ZERO THREE PER. I ONLY TELL YOU THAT. BECAUSE WHAT THE COSTS ARE IMPORTANT IT'S A SMALL TEAM. WE CAN COME TOGETHER AROUND THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT OUR CULTURE AND OUR FABRIC WHICH INCLUDE CLIMATE% CHANGE WHICH INCLUDE DIVERSITY INCLUSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISS COVER YOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I OUTLOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THAT AND YOU SEE INVESTMENTS IN DISCUSSING THIS FURTHER THE BELL IS ON HIS. UP ADVICE MEANT THEIR RECOMMENDATION IT. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. UP AND DIE IF IN FACT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MATTERS THEN IT SHOULD SHOW UP. IN TERMS OF HOW.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT EACH YEAR APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOLS AND WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON AND ACTING LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH. WE ONLY SEE TWENTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ATTENDING COLLEGE ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF INFORMATION. ON THEIR TEACHERS PROVIDE WHEN IT COMES TO RESOURCES FOR UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH. SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE FORTY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT AND OTHER PIECES OF MEANINGFUL AT THAT LEGISLATION ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOW ATTAINABLE. FOR ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT POPULATION. GIVENTHE CURRENT FEDERAL ARE CLIMBING AROUND DHAKA CONCEPT PUSHED BACK FROM THE DC ADMINISTRATION AND RECENT REMARKS FROM THE PRESIDENT ON EASTER SUNDAY WE AS LEGISLATORS NOW MORE THAN EVER MUST DO MORE TO HELP OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I I WAS BORN IN MEXICO MOST OF YOU KNOW MY STORY. I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AS A YOUNG CHILD AND WAS DEPORTED I SENT BACK TO MEXICO AND CAME BACK AND WAS UNDOCUMENTED UNTIL I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. WITH HARD WORK AND MAINLY EDUCATION I WAS ABLE TO I GET A DEGREE BECOME A TEACHER AND NOW BE SITTING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU PRESENTING THIS BILL. ARE THE STUDENTS THESE STUDENTS LIKE ME ALSO CAME TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER OPPORTUNITY IT IS OUR DUTY TO OUR CREATE POLICIES THAT WILL LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL. OF FUTURE. ARE DREAMERS WILL GROW UP TO PURSUE HIM POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND BETTER PREPARED THEMSELVES TO ENTER CALIFORNIA'S DEMANDING WORKFORCE ARE DREAMERS HAVE MADE CALIFORNIA BETTERING CONTINUE TO AMAZE ME. WITH THEIR COUNSEL ADVOCACY EFFORTS UNDER THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE COUPLE STUDENTS AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT WANT TO SHARE THEIR STORIES RAZA RICK ROSS PSYCHIATRY GET STUDENT IRVINE OF VALLEY CITY COLLEGE. AND WHO THE SUBWAYS ARE MARIST AND I STANISLAUS STATE AND CHRISTOPHER SUCH AS REPRESENTING COALITION FOR HUMAN AYE FOR CHURCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THINK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON I AM JULIE SADRIST AMATUS. AND MY PARENTS WERE THE ORIGINAL DREAMERS. AS AN IMMIGRANT YOUTH I HAVE FACED DAILY CHALLENGES AND FEAR. AND I HAVE SEEN THESE CHALLENGES AND FEAR MANIFESTED AND OUR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CHILDREN. APPLYING FOR COLLEGE I HAD NO RESOURCE. NO RESOURCES OR KNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCES TO HELP AID ME IN MY EDUCATION WITH MY CURRENT STATUS. I CAN APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS OR INTERNSHIPS EVEN WITH MY FOUR POINT OH GRADE POINT AVERAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE I WASN'T A CITIZEN. I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR ME AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS LIMITED TO MY EDUCATION. AS AN IMMIGRANT YOUTH LEADER I NOW SEE THESE CHALLENGES WITH MY COLLEGE COMMUNITY. AT CSU STANISLAUS WE HAVE NO DREAMS CENTER AND NO DREAMER RESOURCE LIAISON TO AID US WITH OUR NEEDS. IT TOOK MONTHS OF PROTESTING OUR UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION ATTENDING MEETINGS ORGANIZING INFORMING AND EDUCATING IN ORDER TO GET A CENTER WHERE YOU. CAN BE SAVED WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION AND WHERE WE CAN GET. SOME SORT OF RESOURCES FOR OUR NEEDS. A WORK IN PROGRESS ARE SMALL DIVERSEY CENTER IS RUN BY STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WHO DO THE WORK THE UNIVERSITY IS BEING PAID FOR. WE HAVE BECOME ARE ONLY RESOURCE THAT WE CAN GO TO. THE MORE SCHOOL MOST SCHOOLS ARE NOT THAT LUCKY. OUR STUDENTS NEED OUR HELP THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN AND BY SIGNING A DREAMER RESOURCE LIAISON WE CAN DO THIS AND SO MUCH MORE. SOURCE STUDENTS CAN GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT FEAR SO THEY CAN BECOME AWARE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SO THEY CAN BECOME OUR FUTURE LEADERS AND PROFESSIONALS. THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS A DRUG CZAR RATHER. I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY MAJOR THIRTY YEAR IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE IDC OFFERS FREE PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO FULFILL THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. HOWEVER THE CAMPUS HAS LEFT IN THE SHADOWS SEVEN HUNDRED OF ITS STUDENTS. IN THE SOUTHERN ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE KOREAN ARE UNDOCUMENTED YET THERE IS NO ADVISER OR SUPPORT GROUP. DESIGNATED ON CAMPUS TO AID THE LARGE POPULATION. I AM ONE OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED AMONG DOCUMENT AND ALTHOUGH MY CAMPUS HAS MANY SOURCES AND CENTERS AYE SOLTERO STRUGGLE TO FIND A PLACE OF BELONGING. AND A PLACE WHERE I FEEL SAFE ON CAMPUS ESPECIALLY WITH THE POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT WE ARE EXPERINCING TODAY. ONE OF THE MAIN STRUGGLES AS AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT IS HAVING TO GO AROUND CAMPUS EXPLAINING MY SITUATION. TELLING THOSE AT THE DESK THAT I AM UNDOCUMENTED SO THAT THEY CAN TELL ME THE INFORMATION I NEED WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINANCIAL AID PROCESS PAYMENTS AND ADMINISTRATION. APPLICATIONS. IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL. BUT WHEN YOU'RE UNDOCUMENTED TELLING THE WRONG PERSON YOUR STATUS CAN COST YOU THE LIFE YOU BUILT IN THIS COUNTRY. OFTEN THE WORKERS DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE CASES LIKE MINE. ESPECIALLY SOME THINGS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING REGARDING BAKA. THERE ARE MOMENTS OF FRUSTRATION WHEN NO ONE ON CAMPUS IS REALLY SURE ON HOW TO HELP YOU SO INSTEAD OF GETTING ONE TO HOPE IN PERSON. ANSWER. ANSWERS FOR YOUR CAMPUS ARE USUALLY. GIVEN TO YOU BY TELLING YOU TO DIAL A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. WHERE AN OPERATOR WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS? THIS WAS THE CASE FOR ME IN MANY SITUATIONS. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM I'M DURING MY FIRST YEAR AT IBC COULD NOT BE ANSWERED BY THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE. AND I WAS FORCED TO HUNT FOR THOSE ANSWERS ON MY OWN. IT WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING WHEN IRAN INTO STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS OPPORTUNITIES OUT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO AFRAID. TO EVEN ASK SOMEBODY FOR HELP ON CAMPUS AND SHARE THEIR STORIES. BEEN UNDOCUMENTED AND FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT MADE THE TRANSITION EVEN MORE CHALLENGING AND ALTHOUGH I EVENTUALLY FOUND THE ANSWERS I WOULD HAVE FELT MORE CONFIDENT OF WHAT I WAS DOING IF I HAD A PROFESSIONAL TO TALK TO ABOUT MY DOUBTS. THESE STUDENTS DESERVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ON CAMPUS WHO WILL BE THERE TO HELP THEM. TO INFORM THEM SOMEONE THEY CAN TRUST AND BUILD THE BOND WITH GET CONCRETE ANSWERS AND NOT JUST THE NUMBER TO DIAL. HAVING SOMEONE WHO SPECIALIZES WITH WORKING WITH STUDENTS AND THE SITUATIONS IS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR SUCCESS. THESE STUDENTS PAY THE SAME AMOUNT OF FEES AND TUITION AND AT TIMES EVEN MORE IF THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR AB FIVE FORTY. THEREFORE IT IS UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COLLEGE THAT THE STUDENTS DON'T GO UNNOTICED. AND GIVEN THE RESOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LEAVE THAT MOVEMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE A BILL THAT WILL HELP INSURE OUR LACTATING STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE BASIC NEEDS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. A GROWING NUMBER OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE PROVIDING ADEQUATE LACTATE LACTATION SPACES FOR THEIR STUDENT BODY. HOWEVER INADEQUATE SPACES OR UNSANITARY LOOK LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS WITHIN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS STILL EXIST AND HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS HAD SERIOUS HEALTH AND GENDER INEQUITY ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY THE LACK OF DESCRIPTIVE SYSTEM WIDE POLICIES REGARDING LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS LIMITS ACCESS TO BASIC STUDENT NEEDS HERE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. MY YEAH RAM WITH THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE IN. AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS SPONSORING THE BILL. AND FOUGHT LARA AND ME MEANS MEANS IF THEY HAVE TO HELP ME NOTHING A CURRENT STUDENT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE WHO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS FOR OVER A YEAR. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NINA AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MEYER ROB AND I AM AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT UCLA A PART OF THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE TEAM AND THIS YEAR'S WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE CLASS. THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE IS A PROGRAM OF THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE. UNDER CURRENT LAW STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE LACK TEACHING ACCOMMODATIONS THEY NEED AND DESERVE. UPON SURVEYING THE SEVENTY TWO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND ALL CSU CAMPUSES OUR TEAM HAS FOUND MANY INCONSISTENCIES AND LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS ACROSS CAMPUSES. WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF STUDENTS PUMPING MILK AND TINY BATHROOM STALLS A STUDENT HAVING TO WALK TO THEIR CARS TO NURSE OR PUMP IN BETWEEN CLASSES. AND OF STUDENTS BEING PENALIZED FOR LEAVING CLASS EARLY TO PUMP MILK AND RELIEVE DISCOMFORT. THIS IS WRONG. A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION WHILE MAKING THE BEST CHOICES FOR THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE LOCATION OF THE CAMPUS. ADDITIONALLY STUDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO LIKE TEACHING ACCOMMODATIONS INDICATE THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS WHEN THEY GRADUATE AND ENTER COLLEGE. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO NURSE AND PUMP MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN SPACES THAT MEET BASIC NEEDS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR ACCESS TO EDUCATION. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY BREAST FEED LA ONE OUT OF THREE INDIVIDUALS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHO STOP BREASTFEEDING EARLIER THAN PLANNED CITED THAT IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING WANTS A RETURN TO SCHOOL OR WORK. ADDITIONALLY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE BREASTFEEDING DISCRIMINATION ONE OUT OF FIVE INDIVIDUALS STATED THAT THEY EXPERIENCED BITS DISCRIMINATION IN A SCHOOL SETTING. WITHOUT THE ACCOMMODATIONS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL STUDENT PARENTS ARE FACED WITH THREE ON JUST OPTIONS. DO SO AN UNCOMFORTABLE SPACES DISCONTINUE NURSING OR PUMPING ALTOGETHER. OR LEAVE COLLEGE. MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GENDER JUSTICE IMPACTING PARENTING WOMEN TRANCE BOTH AND GENDER NON CONFORMING INDIVIDUALS. THE CURRENT INCONSISTENCIES REPRESENT A DISCRIMINATORY BARRIER THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF CREATING EQUITABLE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS FOR ALL STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT PARENTS STUDENTS. AND WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT WE HAVE THANK YOU. IT OFTEN CHEN MEDINA AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME'S LARA MUNCHIES I'M IN ANTHROPOLOGY STUDENT AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE AND I'M A PARENT. I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD. AND PREGNANT WITH MY DAUGHTER WHEN ALL OF MY FRIENDS WERE GOING TO COLLEGE. I COULDN'T GO BECAUSE COLLEGES DIDN'T HAVE FACILITIES FOR STUDENTS LIKE ME. I AM AS PARENTING STUDENTS WE WORK WE JUGGLE FAMILY LIFE AND WE STUDY. THIS IS WHAT MAKES COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR US THIS IS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY OF US ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES HOWEVER. IN MY EXPERIENCE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T REALLY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY. TO SUPPORT OR. WELCOME STUDENTS LIKE ME. I'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET LACTATION FACILITIES ON MY CAMPUS FOR OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AND DURING THIS PERIOD OF SPOKEN TO SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN A SMALL BREAK WHILE I NEED TO GIVE BIRTH. AND THEN NOT COME BACK. I'M. THEY DON'T COME BACK BECAUSE THE CAMPUS FACILITIES MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE BOTH PARENTS AND STUDENTS. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE OFFICE VERY SMALL CHANGE WITH AN OUTSIZE IMPACT. LACTATION FACILITIES ON CAMPUS WOULD MEAN THAT THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO STOP STUDYING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT. THE MULTI GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF COLLEGE EDUCATION IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THE CHILDREN OF OUR STUDENTS ARE YOUNG AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. M. IF THESE WITH THE DISEASE HAD BEEN AVAILABLE WHEN I WAS NINETEEN. I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE. LEGISLATORS HAVE TO MAKE THIS CHANGE SO THE PARENTING STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. I WORK MULTIPLE JOBS A STUDY FULL TIME AND I MANAGEMENT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME AND FOR STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF TO FIGHT THESE BATTLES BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO. THERE ARE THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM THE SAME PRIVILEGE I HAVE. WHO DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK WHERE TO LOOK WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE QUESTIONING THOSE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY? STUDENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE RIDICULOUS FROM THIS SCHOOLS TITLE MINOR UP LIKE I HAVE. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CORNER THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT IN THE HALLWAY AT TEMPLE HAIKAI DID. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT SO HARD FOR FACILITIES WHICH WE HAVEN'T ACTUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL NEAT. WE VERY RECENTLY GOT LACTATION FACILITIES ON OUR CAMPUS AND I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU JUST A VERY LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE VICTORY. OUR LACTATING STUDENTS AT LBC SEE ARE ALLOWED TO PUMP IN AN EXAM ROOM IN THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER IF. AND ONLY IF THAT ROOM IS NOT IN USE PREVIOUSLY. THERE ARE LOTS PUMP IN A SPACE WITH SIX STUDENTS SEEK TREATMENT FOR CONTAGIOUS ILLNESSES. THAT THESE MOTHERS THEM CARRY HOME TO THE VULNERABLE INFANTS. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PUMP DURING OFFICE HOURS AND ON WEEKDAYS ONLY. THESE ARE TIMES WHEN STATISTICALLY THERE ARE FEWER PARENTS ON CAMPUS AND ANY OTHER THE SCHOOLS VITAL TO PARENT PARTICIPATION ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THIS BILL SAYS WE SEE YOU. IT SAYS YOU'RE WELCOME HERE AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU CONSIDERING IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WHICH ISN'T SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON KIDDIE ANDREW CHILDREN NOW IN SUPPORT. BRENT IN MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE ON SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHIPMENTS WITH RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

CHAU GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS PART. STEEN MILLER CHAIR OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE OF THE CSU WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS OR AS PART. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS BAKER. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THE BELL. I'M YOU COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND SO. AND IF YOU NEED TO PUT THAT IN A LETTER TO ANYBODY WHO MIGHT SIGN THIS BILL I HOPE YOU WILL. BUT IT'S NOT JUST AN ISSUE OF WELCOMING ITS CONTINUING ON IN THE PROGRESS OF ONE'S EDUCATION HAVING A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO DO SOMETHING IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY NECESSARY. AND TO MAKE THOSE. CHOICES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IT I ALSO THINK IT'S A MATTER OF EQUITY FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE AND SOMETIMES OUR WORKPLACES. GOING TO SCHOOL. AND WE TALK A LOT APPEAR ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THERE'S WORKPLACE EQUITY FOR WOMEN THAT DOES NOT ONLY INCLUDE PAY EQUITY BUT SO MANY OTHER WAYS. AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAYS THE HARDER YOU MAKE IT FOR PEOPLE TO COME BACK FROM HAVING CHILDREN TO THEIR WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT OR STUDYING OR WHATEVER IS. BETTERING THEM ON THEIR CAREER TRAJECTORY THE THE MORE HYPOCRITICAL WE WOULD BE BEING ABOUT. SUPPORTING WORKPLACE EQUITY SOME VERY PROUD YOU'RE DOING THIS VERY GRATEFUL FOR IT I WILL JUST ADD THAT SOMETIMES WE PUT REQUIREMENTS. ON OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND WE DON'T FIND IT OR WE DON'T SOMEHOW TRY TO FACILITATE IT. AND I HOPE THAT IF THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE I I HAVEN'T HEARD IT FROM OF THE TESTIMONIES IT CAME UP FROM IN. ITV AFFECTED ENTITIES BUT IF IT BECOMES AN ISSUE WE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I'M SURE JUST OPEN THE DOOR FOR THAT. A BUT I I THINK YOU TERRIFIC TESTIMONY IMPROPER SUPPORT BILL. MR WOULD. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU NOT EVERY CAMPUS HAS. SOMEONE LIKE LARA FIGHTING FOR THEIR PEERS ABILITY TO PUMP AND NURSE AND. FOR ME I AM A MOTHER OF TWO TRYING TO JUGGLE LEGISLATING AND AND PARENTING I CANNOT IMAGINE. HOW WOULD BE? IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE UP PROPER HELP.

WELL I GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS LAST YEAR I AUTHORED. AB SEVEN OH FIVE WHICH REQUIRED COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO USE OF THE BEST OF MULTIPLE MEASURES TO PLACE STUDENTS IN TWO CLASSES WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT STUDENTS THAT WERE PLACED IN REMEDIAL CLASSES. PAT WERE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER FUND. COMMUNITY A COLLEGE AND SO WE HAVE TWO BILLS THAT ARE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT. THE NEW BILL. A. B. EIGHTEEN OH FIVE. PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE PLACEMENT POLICIES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES PLACE IN POLICIES AT COLLEGES CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND CONFUSING FOR INCOMING STUDENTS THRESHOLD SCORES FOR PLACEMENT TESTS VERY AND STUDENTS. OF AND COLLEGES WILL DECIDE AMONG MANY. DIFFERENT TYPES OF MULTIPLE MEASURES WHICH THEY WILL USE FOR THEIR CAMPUSES THIS BILL INFORM STUDENTS OF HOW THEY WILL BE PLACED INTO THESE TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE COLLEGES TO SUBMIT THEIR. PLACEMENT POLICIES TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND PUBLICLY POST THE PLACEMENT RESULTS A DISAGGREGATED BY RACE AND. ETHNICITY WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE THE COLLEGES FLEXIBILITY ONE COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW SO WE HAVE A INCLUDED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL TO MATCH AB SEVEN OH FIVE I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY PLACEMENT POLICIES. SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON A WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN A COLLEGE COUNSELOR AND STUDENTS WITH ME HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS BILL ARE OLGA RODRIGUEZ FROM PP I SEE. AND IN SUPPORT OF SIERRA ARTS SAY. FROM CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. OKAY. THINK GARY LAND AT IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TOM I MEAN IS A LOT OF THE S. SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOW AT PP A SEAT. AND PPACA IS A NONPARTISAN UP POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION AND DOES NOT TAKE POSITION ON BELL SO WHAT I'M GONNA DISCUSS AND PRESENT HERE TODAY. IT'S BASED ON THE RESEARCH WILL I AM WE CONDUCTED ON CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M SO EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES IDENTIFY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS AS NOT READY FOR TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES IN MATH AND ENGLISH. AND SINCE THESE COURSES ARE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS WHO WISH TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. STUDENTS WHO ARE DIFFERENT DEEMED UNDER PREPARED OUR REPORT VERY FOR TO A SEQUENCE OF COURSES. ALSO NO NO NO STILL MENTAL REMEDIAL BASIC SKILLS COURSES THAT DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS A DEGREE. AND SO THESE PLACEMENT DECISIONS HAVE VERY PROFOUND IMPACT ON STUDENTS TRAJECTORY ONCE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL. OUR STUDY FINDS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS COMING INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DEEMED UNDER PREPARED AND REFER TO THESE CORSETS. AND VERY FEW OF THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY END UP COMPLETING THE TRANSFER LEVEL OF MATH AND ENGLISH REQUIREMENT THEY NEED ARM AND EVEN FEWER OF THEM I. AND UP TRANSFERRING TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. I AM SO DESPITE THIS CRITICAL ROLE OF ASSESSMENT EMPLACEMENT AND AND. HISTORICALLY. IT'S NOT MUCH IS KNOWN OF OF HOW ACTUALLY COLLEGES ARE APPROACHING THIS ASSESSMENT PLACEMENT PROCESS. FOR MATH ENGLISH AND YOURSELF AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF COLLEGES DO NOT PUBLICLY REPORT THIS INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITES ARE ON. OR CATALOGS. AND SO TO HELP FILL THIS INFORMATION GAP AND BECKONS TWENTY FIFTEEN WE WE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE SURVEYED COLLEGES. TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW HOW HOW THE ASSASSIN PLEASE STUDENTS I HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN COLLEGES PARTICIPATED IN THIS SURVEY. AND THE REPORTED ON POLICIES AND PRACTICES USED TO ASSESS SOMEPLACE STUDENTS I'M INTO TRANSFER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES AS WELL AS TO IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF YES SOUTH. I'M. SO THE BROAD PULL THIS SURVEY WAS TO PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS WITH THE DESCRIPTIVE LANDSCAPE. AND TO HELP UNDERSTOOD HELP IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLICIES USED ACROSS THE SYSTEM TO WITHOUT SIMPLY STUDENTS INTO MAPPING QUESTION YES OF COURSE IT'S. AND THIS BILL THE RESULT OF THE RESEARCH WERE ALSO. WHERE ALSO IMPORTANT IN PROVIDING A BASELINE OF HOW COLLEGES WERE APPROACHING THESE POLICY THE IMPACT THAT THIS? PRIOR TO REFORMS ASSOCIATED. LIKE THE ONE THAT JUST. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AND COLLEAGUES HAVE STARTED TO WORK ON SOME REFORM SO WE WANTED A BASS LINE HOW COLLEGES ARE DOING PRIOR TO THE CHANGE. SO UP NEXT TO SUMMARIZE US SOME OF ARMY FINDING. IT IN JUST A REMINDER THE PRESENTERS THAT WE SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT. TO ME TOO MANY. SO JUST GIVE THE HIGHLIGHT IT. AND IT DOES ENJOY SUPPORT. OKAY. OKAY IT SO SO I ONE OF THE THINGS IS. WE FOUND THAT COLLEGES ARE ARE HEAVILY RELYING ON PLACEMENT TESTS ON TO ASSESS SIMPLY STUDENTS INTO THE COLLEGE THE INTO COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES. I'M AND EVEN THOUGH COLLEGES ARE USING THE SAME TEST THE MAY BE SETTING DIFFERENT CUT SCORES SO WHERE STUDENT GO AND ENDS UP IN ROLENE LARGELY DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT A STUDENT IS GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES. AND WE FOUND THAT I'M STILL UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY. AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAD. EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE ACCESS TO TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES ESPECIALLY IN MATH THAT JUST BY VIRTUE OF ATTENDING COLLEGES THAT SET HIGHER CUT SCORES. AND SO THIS LACK OF CONSISTENCY EVEN ONE COLLEGES USE THE SAME TASK OF THE SAME MEASURES. HOW? IS IT'S VERY DETRIMENTAL BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT IS CONFUSING FOR A STUDENT ARE ENROLLING IN ONE COLLEGE THAT GOOD DEFINITION OF BEING COLLEGE READY IS STIFF. AND IT HAS A AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY A CRITICAL BECAUSE FORTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS ENROLLING MORE THAN ONE COLLEGE. SO THEY MIGHT EVEN WITHIN THE THING DISTRICTS THEY MAY BE CONFRONTED BY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT EMPLACEMENTS. YEAH I WON BECAUSE THEY MAY BE REFERRED TO REMEDIATION AND THE OTHER ONE THERE ANY MAYBE REFER TO TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES IT I'M GONNA STOP YOU THERE THAT'S OKAY. IT IS OF THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR THE OTHER PRESENTERS FEDERAL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WILL TRY TO BE QUICK US THERE ARE C. ON BEHALF OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE BROAD BASED BIPARTISAN COALITION THAT WORKS TO ENSURE COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. AND WE SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN OH FIVE IT WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AS YOU JUST HEARD FOR THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT'S PLACEMENT IS DESTINY. UNFORTUNATELY MOST STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF ASSESSMENT EMPLACEMENT POLICIES ON A CAMPUS THEREFORE THEY NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE POLICIES MAY IMPACT THEIR COLLEGE PATHWAY. THIS INFORMATION IS EITHER CONFUSING ARE NOT FRIENDS PARENTS TO TRANSPARENT TO STUDENTS. MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE SHARED WITH US JUST HOW CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING IT IS TO LEARN ABOUT THAT PLACE BUT POLICIES VERY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS. EVEN WITHIN THE SAME REGION WITH NO EASY WAY FOR A STUDENT TO GATHER THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT WHICH COLLEGE IS BEST POSITIONED TO HELP THEM SUCCEED RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE. LAST YEAR THE CAMPAIGN IS PROUD TO STAND ALONGSIDE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN SUPPORTING LEGISLATION THAT REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN HOW COLLEGES. A WILL ASSESS STUDENT READINESS ALLOWING FOR THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS TO ACCESS TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES IMMEDIATELY UPON STEPPING ONTO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS. SO AB EIGHTEEN OH FIVE IS A CRITICAL NEXT STEP BY ENSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THIS NEW POLICY BUT ALSO THAT CAMPUSES ARE MORE TRANSPARENT WITH STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR PLACEMENT POLICIES. AND PRACTICES BUT TRANSPARENCY EMPLACEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND COMMUNITY COMMUNICATING THIS INFORMATION AND STUDENT FRIENDLY LANGUAGE WILL HELP STUDENTS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN COURSE PLACEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT A. B. EIGHTEEN OH FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN JEFF FROST REPRESENTING VF THREE THOUSAND ESL TEACHERS I'M KITTY SOL. I WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL WERE ALSO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR.

WE LEAVE IT OPEN FOR. ITEM TWO ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN. Q. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED. LAST YEAR SEVEN OH FIVE PASSED WHICH WILL PLACE MANY MORE STUDENTS DIRECTLY INTO TRANSFERRED LEVEL CLASSES. OF THE BEST CHANCE THAT THEY HAVE FOR SUCCESS IS TO OFFER TUTORING ALONGSIDE OF THE TRANSFER LEVEL CLASS STUDIES CONDUCTED BY SAMBAR MEDINA VALLEY COLLEGE A COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS FOUND THAT STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN TUTORING. HAD HIGHER SUCCESS RATES. THEN CAMPUS WIDE AVERAGE SO RIGHT NOW COLLEGES ONLY RECEIVE FUNDING FOR. TUTORING AND BASIC SKILLS COURSES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. FUNDING FOR TUTORING OF DEGREE APPLICABLES OR TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES. AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY COLLEGES WILL STILL RECEIVE FUNDING FOR TUTORING IN BASIC SKILLS HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS LARA MATTOON. FIGHTS CHANCE A CHANCE SIR FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU. BUT TO. THANK YOU LAURA MATTOON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR THE SPONSORS OF AB NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN CHANCELLOR OAKLEY ASK HE PRESIDENT'S OUR OF OUR ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO HELP IDENTIFY COMMON BARRIERS TO STUDENT SUCCESS. OVERWHELMINGLY LEADERS RESPONDED THAT THE EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ON THAT LIMIT THE USE OF SUPERVISORS TUTORING ARE A BARRIER. OUR OFFICE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF SUPERVISED TUTORING EFFICACY. AND OF THE STATUTORY AND REALLY GET REGULATORY BARRIERS. THAT EXIST AND THAT RESULTED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY AB NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. SUPERVISE TUTORING IS A METHOD OF INSTRUCTION THAT INVOLVES A TRAINED TUTOR A QUALIFIED FACULTY MEMBER AND STUDENTS WHO NEED JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND MASTERING THAT SKILL OR SUBJECT AREA. AS WAS MENTIONED NUMEROUS STUDIES SHOW THAT STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE SUPERVISE TUTORING HAVE HIGHER GPAS HIGHER RETENTION RATES. A STUDY OUT OF SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY COLLEGE FOUND IN FACT A SEVEN PERCENT HIGHER RETENTION RATE FOR STUDENTS THAT HAD PARTICIPATED IN SUPERVISE TUTORING. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE USE OF SUPERVISED TUTORING FROM JUST BASIC SKILLS WORTH AUTHORIZED CURRENTLY TO INCLUDE TRANSFER LEVEL AND DEGREE APPLICABLE COURSES. WE WILL ALSO BE MAKING REGULATORY CHANGES TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO SELF SELECT INTO SUPERVISE TUTORING RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE TO BE REFERRED BY A FACULTY MEMBER OR A COUNSELOR.

ARE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT HAS HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS BEING STUCK IN A REMEDIAL CLASSES AND. ODDS ARE EVENTUALLY THEY DROP OUT SO THAT IS A HUGE LOSS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND HOPEFULLY THROUGH THE SET OF BILLS WHERE WE'VE WORKED WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKE HOLDERS WILL START TO SEE STUDENTS MOVING THROUGH. COMMUNITY COLLEGE FASTER. INTO EITHER A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL OR WITH. ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FOR OUR ECONOMY GOING FORWARD AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO ATTAIN A BETTER LIFESTYLE. I'D I JUST WANNA SAY AS A FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHER. AND AS A TRUSTEE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT THESE MEASURES ARE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. A AYE I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT SENATOR WILK HAS A SIMILAR BILL. AND JUST WONDERED IF HE'D HAD ANY CONVERSATION WITH HIM. OF. HAVE WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. WE WE WE DO THAT SINCE SINCE AND SINCE YOU DO. IT. GOOD IDEA AND HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO TALK. IT'S THERE SIMILAR BILLS. SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY.

BUT MR WILL MAKE US A QUICK TWENTY MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR LONG THINK OF THAT AGE MY MY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT ON. AB TWENTY THREE OH SIX THAT WOULD INCREASE THE ACCOUNT AND ELIGIBILITY FOR FULL TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE. STUDENT FROM A FOUR YEAR TO SIX YEAR PERIOD AYE THIS WOODEN AT THIS WOULD NOW MATCHED THE. THE PELL GRANT THAT IS NOW. IN EXISTENCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE CAL GRANT EARLY EIN ULTIMATELY WOULD INCREASE OUR THE SUCCESS RATE OF STUDENTS. ARE WHO CAN CONTINUE TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OUT WITH FINANCIAL AID AT THE CAL GRANT AND THEN CONTINUE INTO THEIR FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. I HAVE HERE A WITNESS WITH US THE CHANCE OF LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I MIGHT ADD WHERE I SERVED ONCE AND I'M ALSO THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE NATION. WELCOME TO GET. THANK YOU SO MEMBER SENT THAT'LL. GERMANY NOT ANIMAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TAG COULD AFTERNOON WHEN A STATE OF THIS SAN FRANCISCO BUT I GUESS. THE CHANCE OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMITTEE COLORS DISTRICT. AND WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY THREE ALL SIX AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. AS WAS MENTIONED AB TWENTY THREE OF SIX WOULD EXTEND CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS TO SIX YEARS OF FULL TIME ENROLLMENT. THEREBY ALIGNING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WITH THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM. THIS YEAR'S. EXISTING LAW ONLY PERMITS STUDENTS TO RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT AWARD FOR FOUR YEARS OF FULL TIME ATTENDANCE. AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM. EXTENDING CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY TO SIX YEARS WOULD RESULT IN MORE CAL GRANT ABOARD HE'S ACTUALLY UTILIZING MORE THE ELIGIBILITY. WHILE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND. TO MORE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHILE ATTENDING. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS NOTED IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE HAVE FOUND THAT TYPICALLY ARE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKE FOUR YEARS OR MORE. TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AND UPON TRANSFERRING MOST TAKE ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO GRADUATE. SPIKE ARE LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT LOW INCOME STUDENT POPULATION AT LACC DE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. NINE COLLEGES AND ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF SO LIVE AT OR BELOW. OF THE PARTY LINE THERE IS A SEVERE UNDER UTILIZATION OF THE CAL GRANT AWARD BECAUSE STUDENTS FEEL OBLIGATED TO SAVE THEIR CAL GRANT FOR THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY TUITION. THIS CAUSES ARE STUDENTS TO UNNECESSARILY EXTEND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY OFTEN INCREASED THEIR WORK HOURS AND ARE REDUCE THEIR COURSE LOADS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY THREE ALL SIX. OUR STATE CAL GRANT PROGRAM ALIGNS WITH THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM TO SIX YEARS AS WAS MENTIONED. AND IN DOING SO MORE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL APPLY FOR EXCEPT THE USER WORK HOURS INCREASED OUR COURSE LOADS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH FINANCIAL AID. THAT'S. TRANSFER MORE QUICKLY TO THE UNIVERSITY AND BECOME MORE ACADEMICALLY SUCCESSFUL. THE LOS ANGELES COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE ALL SIX BECAUSE IT ALLOWS MORE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS TO RECEIVE. A CAL GRANT WHILE COMPLETING THEIR COMMITTEE COLLEGE PROGRAM ENABLE STUDENTS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT REMAINING CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY AT THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGE UNIVERSITY. I'M VERY PLEASED THAT THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA'S TO NATE COMMISSION. I COMMITTEE BECAUSE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA THE FACT ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND NUMEROUS TOO MANY COLORS DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON AARON HUDDLES IN REPRESENTING THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE ARE IN SUPPORT. STEPHANIE DOT ALL OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT. RANMA CONTINUED THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MARK MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTHILL DE ANZA LOS RIOS PERALTA SANDIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MAYBE AS REPRESENTS SOUNDS A EVERGREEN CAN CAUSE HAS VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SOME OF ONTARIO. RUSS I DEANDRE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AYE WE TYPICALLY SUPPORT BILLS THAT EXPAND FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WERE. STILL BETTING THE BILL IS GOING THROUGH A PROCESS SO. WILL BE OUT WORKING ON THE SPELL. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS BAKER THANK YOU OUT OF. S. TRYNA PLAY A LITTLE BIT BETTER HOW MAKING THIS. IT'LL HAPPEN IN SIX YEARS. WILL. HELP SOMEONE FINISH SOONER OR HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET. THE OPPORTUNITY AND I MEAN AS NEGATIVE AN INCENTIVE TO TO GET THROUGH THE COMMUTER BECAUSE PARTING GET TO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO TRANSFER TO POTENTIALLY AND. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HELPS SOMEONE GET IT DONE SOONER. SIR. THEY ARE TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO LIKE. SHOULD I SPECIAL IF THEY'RE NOT CAN FINANCIAL HELP. FOR SIX YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR THREATENING I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION YEAH I'LL GIVE EXAMPLE MYSELF IT WHEN I WAS GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD THAT YOU APPLY TOWARD THE END FOR FINANCIAL AID. SO THAT YOU CAN USE SOME OF THAT WHEN YOU GET TO A UNIVERSITY. AND YOU LOOK THE WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MOST WORKING CLASS. COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY OF FOLKS ARE STRUGGLING GOING THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THERE IS A THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR SOME STUDENTS TO TAKE NON CREDIT COURSES A REMEDIATION COURSES THAT MAY BERNIE YEAR TO THAT WAS THE CASE FOR ME. AND THEN CERTAINLY WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY CAN ACTUALLY STAY IN SCHOOL. SO IF IT GIVEN THE ABILITY TO USE FINANCIALLY EARLIER YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAY IN SCHOOL. AND ACTUALLY. FINISH WHICH IS WHAT THIS WHOLE. AT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR. BUT WOULDN'T CHANGE APPRECIATE THAT IT WOULDN'T CHANGE IF YOU'RE GOING TO. AS YOU SAY BERNIE YEAR ON REMEDIATION. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YEAR ANYWAY BUT I I I WOULD THINK. I'M AND. I I. I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE AYE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS IN THE PATHWAYS OPEN BUT ALSO KEEP THAT. THAT ABILITY TO SUPPORT HIM TO COMPLETE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT POTENTIALLY CREATING. IT IN THE OPPOSITE IN FACT. WILL LOOK BECAUSE LOOK WE STRUGGLED WITH THIS TO WRITE IN TERMS OF MOST OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT COME TOWARDS US WHAT WE WERE DOING FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE FACED. WE FACED SIMILAR ARGUMENTS WERE FULL TWENTY TO PUSH US TO DO FIFTEEN UNITS. PER SEMESTER IN ORDER DO FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE PUSHED BACK. ENDED TWELVE UNITS THE SAME ARGUMENT WAS I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE A AND THE UNDERLYING ARGUMENT IS ONE TO ONE INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO IT SHORTER BY IT BY GIVING MORE FINANCIALLY IF IT WAS SHORTER. AND IF YOU'RE MAKING A LOT MORE FINANCIAL AID YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DECREASE SOMEBODY'S POSSIBILITY OF. PURPOSE OF EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE GET SOMEBODY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND IF THIS IS A TOOL THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOMEBODY BELIEVE IT COMPLETE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I WOULD I WOULD USE THIS DATA TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AYE ONE WANTS TO MISS THE FALLOUT AND THAT'S REALLY THE THE DANGER AND NOT GIVING FREE COMMUNITY ONSITE NOT DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A FIGHT CALTRANS FOR US. FOR SIX YEARS AND THE CASE IN POINT IS A PROGRAM FOR USE FOR SIX YEARS. AND SO WE WANT TO LINE IT UP TO TO STANDARDS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE A STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL. OKAY AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING TO. OKAY JAMMIN MORE STUDENTS UP WITH MORE CLASSES. OR TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO IT IN A SHORTER AND SHORTER TIME FRAME ALL ULTIMATELY ENDS UP POTENTIALLY HURT IN THE GREAT IF THEY'RE HAVING TO RUSH TO CLASSES. AND INSTEAD OF GETTING AN A YOU GET A BEER YOU GET TO SEE IN YOU ACTUALLY. YOU ACTUALLY DID TORAH STUDENTS POSSIBILITY OF GETTING IN THE IN A BETTER POST GRADUATE SCHOOL. FOR GETTING INTO POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL SO THERE'S A. WILL THERE'S A WAY WE CAN CONTINUE ON THE ARE ON ON THIS CONVERSATION. BUT ULTIMATELY IF I TAKE A LOOK AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR AN EDUCATION SYSTEM AS THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO MAKE A STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL MAN MEANS COMPLETING GRADUATING AND GOING ON. EITHER GET A JOB REPORTS GRADUATE AND I THINK THESE ARE. GOOD TOOLS TO CONTINUE THAT YEAH AND I I'M I. I APPRECIATE THE AM. CONVERSATION AT THE. POINT YOU YOU'RE SAYING IS IF THE ARGUMENT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS WITH A FREE TUITION AND THAT'S NOT MINE AYE SPIES THAT MAY HAVE. FUNDS AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE OPTIMALLY SUPPORTING STUDENTS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT PART THAT IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY JUST TO GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE SOME OF THE POINTS YOU'VE RAISED ARE GOOD ONES ARE JUST ONES THAT TO ME ARE GOING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS FOR THE STUDENT AND MAKE. MAKE IT ANY MORE LIKELY THAT THEY CAN COMPETE ARE COMPLETE IN THE TIME FOR ME THAT WE WOULD WANT THEM TO. AND SPECIAL BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE HOW CAMINO ABSOLUTE HELP THEM TO COMPLETE MY CONCERN ALSO IS I I DO HAVE. UP FIRST MUCH AS OF SUPPORTED MORE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND EVERY TIME WE SAY IS. REALLY PUT MORE INTO CAL GRANT THERE'S A LOT OF INEQUITIES IN THE CAL GRANT WE STILL HAVE DEFECTS THAT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO FINISH AND HAVE SUPPORT TO FINISH ON TIME AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA AND I'M NOT SURE. THE. WHERE THE WHOLE IS RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE MENTIONED YOUR GOOD POINTS WILL JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HOLD THIS IS FILLING LET ME PUT THE CONVERSATIONAL OF IT? A LITTLE BIT AT A. A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BE OR ALREADY ON A TRACK THAT SUCCESS WE'RE TRYING TO SHORE SHORTEN THE TIME LIMIT. THAT SOMEBODY ELSE THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA PUT US RIGHT ISSUES AND I'M SORRY I'M NOT TRYING TO SHORTEN THE TIME LIMIT STUDENTS I WANT I WANT TO KEEP THEM ON THE PATHWAY THERE ON I DON'T SEE HOW THIS. THAT THAT HELPS THEM COMPLETE THAT A GROUP OF STUDENTS HAS ALREADY A PATHWAY TOWARD SUCCESS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO WERE NOT ON A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL. I THINK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DOCTOR WEBER. YEAH YEAH I APPRECIATE THE BILL COMING FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND IT AND I THINK. OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT TO WRAP. SOME OF OUR MINDS AROUND THE THE THREE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE AN IN THE COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM ISN'T VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF SYSTEM. A AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK AND I'VE HAD LOTS OF STUDENTS WHO SPENT MANY YEARS THE COMMUTER COLLEGES WHO'VE BEEN TO TRANSFER TO THE UNIVERSITY. ARE AND SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT AND THINK GEE THEY SHOULD OF DONE THE FASTER THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT. CLEANER THEY SHOULD UP WHATEVER AND AND. WITHOUT A RECOGNITION THAT OFTENTIMES THE STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE COMMUNICABLE IS TO SYSTEM NUMBER ONE WE KNOW THEY HAVE REMEDIAL ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. TO THEY'RE NOT PROGRAM TO GO TO COLLEGE MOST OF THEM ARE NOT. THAT IN THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVEN'T THEY HAD THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT YEARS BEFORE AND TAKEN S. A. T. AND TRY TO GET INTO SOME FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION I MEAN THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE HITTING. ON THAT PATH INITIALLY SO YOU'VE GOT SOME CHALLENGES THERE. WE ALSO KNOW FROM OUR OWN RESEARCH YOU THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE INSTITUTION WE HAVE IS REALLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MOST OF THEM ARE STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T PAY THE HIGH FEES THEY HAVE LIVING EXPENSES AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. AND SO OFTENTIMES OUR STUDENTS WHO DON'T GET. MUCH FINANCIAL AID I DON'T APPLY FOR IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY WANT TO SAVE IT FOR THE UNIVERSITY. ARE OUT ARE BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD THEM THAT COLLEGE WAS CHEAPER AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND IT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. THE ACTUAL FEES A PEOPLE PAPER WHEN YOU GO BEYOND THAT AND START TALKING ABOUT LIVING EXPENSES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT AND MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE WORKING. SOME HAVE FAMILIES HAVE ALL KINDS OF ISSUES THAT ARE THERE AND BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MAY HAVE TO SAY FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCES. THREE FOUR YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THEY DON'T OFTEN DO FINANCIAL AID. THAT MUCH AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEY MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THE KEEP THE MOVING FORCE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK SO MUCH. THEY DON'T HAVE TO DROP OUT ONE FOR ONE SEMESTER TO THE NEXT TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO GET THE BOOKS I MEAN THAT'S JUST UP A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT. BECAUSE THEY WANT PROGRAM FOR THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE COLLEGES THAT NOT GETTING THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT KIND OF DIRECTION AND WE LOSE A LOT OF STUDENTS AND I'VE HAD STUDENTS TO SAY WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG. AND WHEN I ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEIR JOURNEY IT WAS YOU KNOW ALMOST LIKE A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR ONE SEMESTER TO THE NEXT. WE HAD TO DO THIS I HAD TO DO THAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR THIS THAT TOP AND DO THINGS AND SO IT REALLY IS. QUITE AN INTERESTING JOURNEY WHEN YOU DEAL WITH COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO FINALLY MAKE IT TO THE FORTY INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT DEALT WITH THEM AND THEY DO ABOUT THE TIME TO GIVE OF THEIR OLDER. THEY HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN INCOMMUNICADO JUST OF SEVERAL COMMITTEE COLLEGES OVER AND OVER AND SO AND AND THEY DON'T GET ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AID IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS INTO THE ALMOST AT THE END. SO I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT POPULATION STUDENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT. TRYING TO LAND IT WOULD PROGRAM TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY LISTEN YOU CAN ALSO GET SOME FINANCIAL AID SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK SO HARD. AND DON'T HAVE TO DELAY GETTING YOUR BOOKS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND YOU REALLY CAN BE A STUDENT WORKING PART TIME IN GOING TO COLLEGE SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. T THAT LEVEL AT NET AT THIS I THINK WE'VE LEARNED ONE OF OUR. PROGRAM TO HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AND SEE ISSUES NEW SEASON WHEN WE WHEN WE TAKE OUT THE FAT VARIABLE OF. OF OF OF. TUITION AND LOOK AT THE EXPENSES AND WE DISCOVER THAT WE GIVE MORE MONEY FOR SEE ISSUES MORE MONEY FOR UC'S FOR LIVING EXPENSES ALMOST NONE FAR COMMUNICATIVE AND SO AS A RESULT. THEY END UP WITH THE WILL OF THE HIGHER. EDUCATION COSTS THEN THE OTHER STUDENTS AND SO WE REALLY REALLY HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN SO I APPRECIATE YOU COMING FORWARD WITH THIS BECAUSE IT IS. IT IS AN ISSUE WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH LONG TERM AND IT WOULD GIVE WITHIN SOME PROVIDE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND HELP THEM THEY. AFFECT THEY SHOULD GET IT EARLIER WILL BASICALLY BE IT AN INCENTIVE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK WE TAKE THINK ABOUT INCENTIVES AS IF TO SAY GRADUATION ITSELF IS AN AND SENATE ANDTHAT IS BUT THERE'S A A DIFFERENT KIND OF JOURNEY THIS THE. AND THEY HANG IN THERE TO GET BEER BUT IT'S NOT THIS TYPICAL BILLION JOE COLLEGE MENTALITY THAT JUST GOING TO SCHOOL AND BEING HAPPY EVERY DAY AND YOU KNOW DO WHATEVER YOU DO ON WEEKENDS. AND AND GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A MYTH NOWADAYS FOR ALMOST EVERY STUDENT BUT IT'S A GOAL BUT IT'S NOT THE STUDENTS DON'T WANT TO ACHIEVE IT IS DOES T BECOMES DIFFICULT. I APPRECIATE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A I SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND AND. THE MOVE BY DOCTOR WEBER SECOND BY MISTER LOW. YOU'RE SANTIAGO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND YET I THINK YOU FOR COMMENTS AND TAKE YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS.

ITEM NUMBER TEN. ITEM TEN. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FOUR. WELCOME MR GUYS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY'S BECAUSE RESOLUTION ARE TODAY'S LEGISLATION THAT BUILDS ON ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TWENTY ONE I WHICH WAS ALSO CO AUTHORED OR JOINTLY AUTHORED BY ME IN ASSEMBLY. MEMBER QUIRK I WHICH PASSED BOTH HOUSES UNANIMOUSLY IN WHICH CALLED ON CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSITIES TO ADOPT BRIEF SPEECH STATEMENTS THAT REAFFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FREE EXPRESSION. TODAY'S BELL AYE BUILDS ON THAT COMMITMENT IT DRAWS ON THE WORK OF TWO PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY. ERWIN CHEMERINSKY DEAN OF UC BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL AND HOWARD GILMAN CHANCELLOR OF UC IRVINE. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED NOT ONLY BY THOSE SCHOLARS BUT ALSO BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ITSELF. DEAN XIN MARIN SKIN CANCER GILMAN'S BOOK FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS NOTES THAT A DEEP PERSISTENT IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS IN SOCIETY ARE LEADING MANY TO TREAT POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS ENEMIES. SHOUT DOWN CRITICS AND REJECT COMPROMISE. BUT UNIVERSITIES MUST STRIVE TO DO BETTER. COLLEGE CAMPUSES THE AUTHORS WRITE STAND AS MODELS FOR HOW DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. THEY HAD THAT UNIVERSITIES MAKE THEIR STRONGEST CONTRIBUTION TO FREE SOCIETIES WHAT A LIVELY AND DIVERSE CAMPUS COMMUNITY SHOWS A GENUINE DESIRE TO ENGAGE COMPETING PERSPECTIVES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH DEAN CHAMBER AND SKIN CHANCEL GILMAN THE CRAFT THOUGHTFUL POLICY AIMED AT PROMOTING LIVELY AND DIVERSE CAMPUS COMMUNITIES WERE FREE SPEECH. FOR ASH. THIS BILL HAS TWO PARTS. THE FIRST CALLS ON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES AND URGES UC CAMPUSES TO CREATE AND DISSEMINATE FREE SPEECH STATEMENTS THAT INFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE EXPRESSION. FOSTERING A CULTURE OF FREE SPEECH DEPENDS ON CAMPUSES CLEARLY COMMUNICATING THEIR COMMITMENT TO FREE EXPRESSION ACADEMIC INQUIRY THAT PUBLIC DEBATE. THIS IS THE VERY PRINCIPLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENDORSED LAST YEAR WHEN IT UNANIMOUSLY PASSED STR TWENTY ONE. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF TODAY'S BILL LOT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU CAMPUSES AND WOULD URGE UC CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHING THE HISTORY AND VALUE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THIS IS THE RECOGNITION AS DEAN CHEVRON SKI AND A CHANCE R. GILMAN HAVE EXPLAINED THAT IN APPRECIATION OUR THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE AND CIVIC PURPOSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. BY ENSURING THE UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING THE HISTORY VALUE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS ACT AIMS TO ENGENDER AN APPRECIATION FOR FREE SPEECH AND CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE DIVERSE IDEAS CAN BE EXPRESSED AND DEBATED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND JOINING ME TODAY IS TAMMY AT ROSMAN BENJAMIN. WHO IS DIRECTOR OF ON CUT INITIATIVE? HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND. AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS TAMMY ROTHMAN BENJAMIN AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNPUNISHED IF WHICH IS A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. DEDICATED TO MONITORING INVESTIGATING IN COMBAT IN CAMPUS ANTI SEMITISM NATIONALLY. I WAS ALSO A FACULTY MEMBER AT UC SANTA CRUZ FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. OVER THE PAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN A SHARP SPIKE IN ACTS OF HATRED AND INTOLERANCE. TARGETING AFRICAN AMERICANS JEWS MOSLEMS LGBTQ COMMUNITY MEMBERS IMMIGRANTS WOMEN AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HER WHO HOLD DIVERGENT IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS AND IDENTITIES. SADLY WE ARE WITNESSING AN UNPRECEDENTED UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT OR MERELY RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT. BACKGROUNDS BELIEFS OR BEHAVIOR THAT DIFFER FROM ONE'S OWN. OUR MONITORING AND RESEARCH INDICATE THAT THIS IS MOST PROBLEMATIC ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. WHERE WE FIND THAT ONE GROUP'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS BEING USED TO DENIGRATE HARASS INTIMIDATE AND SHUT DOWN? THE THE EXPRESSION OF OTHER GROUPS. THIS NOT ONLY DEPRIVES INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND SOCIAL POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC RIGHTS. IT UNDERMINES THE VERY MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH OUR ORGANIZATION FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON PROTECTING JEWISH STUDENTS FROM INTOLERANT BEHAVIOR THAT'S ANTI SEMITIC. WE BELIEVE THE ENTIRE CAMPUS BENEFITS WHEN ALL STUDENTS ARE INSURED EQUAL PROTECTION FROM EXCLUSIONARY BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. AND FULL PARTICIPATION IN CAMPUS LIFE. AND TOWARDS THAT END WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF ADEQUATE AND EQUITABLE RESPONSES TO EXCLUSIONARY BEHAVIOR. AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES THAT CAN HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND ENCOURAGE TOLERANT AND RESPECTFUL BEHAVIORS THAT ALLOW FOR THE EXPRESSION OF A WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS AND IDENTITIES. THESE ARE THE VERY PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN CODIFIED IN AB TWO THREE SEVEN FOR THE CAMPUS FREE SPEECH ACT. A BILL THAT I BELIEVE WILL GO A LONG WAY TO RESTORING CIVILITY AND RESPECT WHEN YOU SEE CSU IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND UPHOLDING THE PILLARS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR STATE. AND OUR NATION FOR YEARS TO COME THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
