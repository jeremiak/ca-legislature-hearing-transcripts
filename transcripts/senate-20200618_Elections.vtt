HISTORICALLY PART OF JUSTICE

00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.740
HAS REQUIRED THE FORFEITURE OF

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:25.777
VOTING. BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:27.111
OF THE IMPACT OF CRIME ON

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:31.349

IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:52.370
CALIFORNIA. VERY FEW REALLY ARE

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.105
UNSUPERVISED ROLAND UNDER WHICH

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.373
YOU CAN JUST CALL CONDITIONAL

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.342
PAROLE AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE

00:32:57.408 --> 00:33:00.545
CONDITIONS. AND EVEN GET NOW.

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:03.314
IN SOME AREAS WERE PAROLE DOES

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.417
YET EXIST. AN INDIVIDUAL BREAKS

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:08.519

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:11.055
FACE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING RE

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:13.825
INCARCERATION. WHAT COULD BE

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.960
THOSE CONSEQUENCES ONE WHO HAS

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.029
COMMITTED A VIOLENT CRIME. AND

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.263
STILL HAS POSSESSION. OF A

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.634
WEAPON. OR MANY WEAPONS. THAT

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.002
COULD GET THEM BUT BACK IN

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:28.506
CUSTODY. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.341
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NOW. IN

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.210

THEIR VOTING RIGHTS. SIMPLY

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.015
HAVING SERVED YOUR TIME IN

00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:40.318
CUSTODY DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:43.521
SERVED YOUR TIME. THAT DOES NOT

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:46.257
HAPPEN UNTIL YOU ARE OFFICIALLY

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:50.528
DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE. AND

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.263
THAT'S THE TIME WHAT WE NEED TO

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.465
PROTECT FOR THE VICTIMS AND FOR

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.601

LEGIONS OF VICTIMS CALLING IN

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:14.252

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:26.964
THEY NEED TO HAVE A FULL. A

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:31.569

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:33.438
COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES ONCE

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.139
THEY HAVE EXTINGUISHED THEIR
