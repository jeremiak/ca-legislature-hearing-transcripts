BOTH ARE VERY ME MICHAEL ARE HERE IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY YOUR PRESENT AND I WOULD KNOW- AGAIN WHICH SAID ON ITEM TO. THAT THIS CONFORM RELATED ACTIONS ON CHILD CARE RATE REFORM TO BE HEARD IN SOME COMMITTEE THREE TOMORROW SO THAT TO I THINK IT BEGINS TO SUNSHINE HOUSE SOME OF THIS FITS TOGETHER. THIS WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF MR CABRAL ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I AM. AS SENATOR MYSTIC AND MAKE SURE YOU YOU MIGHT CONSIDER. UPPERSIDE I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS- ON ITEM TWO EXPANDED LEARNING TIME I. APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS WAS REVISED TO REFLECT SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE RAISED IN OUR LAST HEARING. AROUND ELEAZAR LIKE MANY IN MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE SOME LOW INCOME STUDENTS BUT MAY NOT HIT THE 55% OR OTHER THRESHOLDS NEEDED TO. RECEIVE FUNDS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I THINK THIS IS MORE EQUITABLE PROMOTION I APPRECIATE- THE CHANGES I ALSO WANT TO ECKERD ECHO GERMAN THERE'S POINT ON THE- RATE REFORM. THAT IS GOING INTO ITEM TEN WITH STATE PRESCHOOL I THINK PER CHILD EARLY CHILD CARE IS OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY. I THINK REFORM IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY I APPRECIATE THIS- I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION IS. HOW SUSTAINABLE IS THIS COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILD CARE AND T. K. IF WE WERE TO HIT ANY KIND OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN- A FEW YEARS OUT. I THINK IT'S A TERMS OF THE ENEMY TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- I AM I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HEADED TO REVENGE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. GUARANTEE SO THAT- THOSE COSTS WHEN ASSEMBLY BE COMING OUT. OF THE THREE PROBABLY NEED POLICY GROWING TO COVER THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS. UNTIL THEY WERE REPORTED THROUGH THEM THE PROBABILITY FORMULA ON THE OTHER SOCCER RATES WOULD BE THROUGH SORT OF NON PROBABLY NEED GENERAL FUND. I THINK WITH ALL THESE THINGS BIG- THERE'S ALWAYS.A RISK THAT IF WE DO HAVE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT THERE'S LESS FUNDING AVAILABLE I THINK I A BIG PART OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THOSE RECORDS THAT DEPENDS ON. YOUR OVERALL PACKAGE WELL WHICH I DON'T THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL TO SORT OF. FULLY- BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW MUCH OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN THE IN THE- SENATE PACKAGE ARE ONGOING HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO FOR EXAMPLE OUR MULTI YOUR OUTLOOK. ON BUT IT BUT IT IS A APPOINTED AS YOU ARE QUITE SOME OF THESE RATE INCREASES IT-DOESN'T MEAN THAT. YOU'RE INCREASING YOUR ONGOING CONFLICTS OVER TIME- TO THE EXTENT THAT REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW TO COVER THOSE COSTS IT'S ENOUGH OF A CONCERN- BUT IF YOU HAVE AN ECONOMIC. DOWNTURN WITH A WITH. A RISK. I APPRECIATE MISTER- AND I GUESS I JUST ENJOY BEFORE YOU GO. YOUR EARNED A- MAGICALLY APPEARED OWNERS. NOT HAND AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANT YOU. TO GO. OR YOU WERE JUST GET YOUR TIME IN THE SUN. MORNING RESEARCHER NO I IT WAS NOT DOING THAT BECAUSE I WANTED TO COMMENT JUST. MAKING SURE THAT- I WAS READY IN CASE- YOU ALL WANTED TO HEAR FROM US I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE FOR NO NO NO NO LEARNING IN MY PRESENCE THERE NO. PROBLEM WHATSOEVER I KNEW YOU WERE HERE ANYWAY A SENATOR MINNESOTA STUDIO JESSICA COULD I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER- AND- YOU KNOW I THINK INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILD CARE IS OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT LONG TERM INVESTMENT THAT WILL IN THE LONG RUN I BELIEVE. BE BETTER FOR OUR ECONOMY BETTER FOR LONG TERM TAX RECEIPTS BUT- I WE ALL OBVIOUSLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- JOE BOAN COMMENTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS pREALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND MODERATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE UNDER TRYING MOMENTS AND- WE HAD FORTY DIFFERENT COLORS. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING. THIS WE'RE GOING TO BE THE MATTER BACK. THE COMMITTEE. IN OUR WE HAVE. IS I DO HAVE A LIST. OF FROM. SENATOR CHOI BOGUE OF THE ITEMS THAT- ON PART A THAT SHE WISHES TO EITHER OF THE STATE VOTE NO. AND SO- I HAVE SEGMENTED THOSE OUT SO IT APPEARS AND WILL GIVE A CHANCE FOR CORRECTIONS TO BE MADE. IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE- UNANIMITY ON ITEMS THREE TO SEVEN NINE THROUGH TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE THROUGH. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY THREE SIXTY ONE SIXTY THREE THROUGH ONE ELEVEN. ONE THIRTEEN THROUGH ONE THIRTY FOUR ONE THIRTY EIGHT THROUGH ONE FORTY ONE. 441-404-1406 THROUGH ONE FORTY NINE. AND ONE FIFTY ONE THROUGH ONE EIGHTY FOUR AND SO I WOULD ASK IF THERE IS A MOTION ON THOSE ITEMS- YES SOME OF THE MOTION BY MEN- AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS A CORRECT RECITAL HERE. RIGHT OKAY THEN I WOULD ASK FOR A ROLL CALL- ON THAT AGGREGATE A MOTION OF THOSE ITEMS. SENATOR LED BY SENATOR MAN BY AND THERE ARE TROUBLED. THE MOTION CARRIES THREE ZERO AND THEN THE OF THE NEXT LIST OF ITEMS WHICH WOULD ROUND OUT EVERYTHING IN AGENDA PART A WOULD BE ITEMS. ONE TWO EIGHT TWENTY FOUR TWENTY NINE SIXTY TWO ONE TWELVE ONE THIRTY FIVE ONE THIRTY SIX ONE THIRTY SEVEN ONE FORTY TO ONE FORTY FIVE AND ONE FIFTY AND SO I WOULD ASK IF THERE IS A MOTION TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THE OUTSIDE SOME OF MOTION BY SENATOR MAN. I THEN WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. EARLIER BY SENATOR MEANT LIFE AND OUR JOB OF. THE NEXT THING AND OKAY THAT IS- NOT VOTING. SO THERE ARE THOSE THAT MOTION CARRIES AND THEN WHEN WE MOVED TO. AGENDA PART B. I THINK WE MIGHT DO THIS AND THREE THINGS THE ERRORS VOTE ON WAYS IN WHICH THERE'S AN AGREEMENT THERE MIGHT BE A MOTION ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS AFTER THAT AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A MOTION ON. OTHER ITEMS THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A UNANIMOUS VOTE SO THE ITEMS ON WHICH I BELIEVE. THERE'S AGREEMENT AND COULD BE TAKEN IN ONE MOTION ARE THE LIBRARY ISSUES ONE THROUGH FIFTEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ISSUES ONE THROUGH EIGHT TEN THROUGH. TWELVE FOURTEEN SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FOUR. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ISSUES ONE THROUGH THREE FIVE THROUGH TWENTY FOUR THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW ISSUES ONE AND TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUES ONE THROUGH THIRTY EIGHT AND FORTY THROUGH FORTY NINE. AND STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AN OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH ISSUES ONE THROUGH THREE. ARM SO IS THERE A MOTION ON THOSE SIDE OF THIS MOTION BY SENATOR MAN. SO ON THE ITEMS THAT I JUST READ WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR LAND HI SENATOR MEANT. HI SENATOR A TROUBLED. THAT MOTION IS APPROVED THREE TO ZERO. AND THEN SENATE ROADSHOW ABOVE DID I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A MOTION ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS OR DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST DO THE REST OF WHICH WAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO. THE WASHINGTON. OPEN THE UC ISSUE NUMBER NINE AND CSU ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. OKAY THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. OKAY THEN- WOULD YOU CALL THE ROLL ON THAT MOTION- LAND NO SENATOR MEN. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I STAND. THERE NOT VOTING. YOU HAVE A CALL CENTER- TROUBLED CRY SENATOR TO ABOUT. THAT MOTION FAILS ONE TO ONE. AND SO NOW- THAT WOULD LEAVE THE REMAINING ITEMS INCLUDING THOSE TWO ON WHICH THERE'S NOT UNANIMITY. OF PALM ED TO PROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT WOULD BE UC ISSUES NINE THIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN CSU ISSUE FOR AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUES THIRTY NINE AND FIFTY YEARS THEIR MOTION TO APPROVE THOSE ISSUES. MOVED BY SENATOR MATH- WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR LAND BY SENATOR MAN ALL RIGHT SENATOR OF TROUBLED. I BELIEVE IN THE- THAT'S AN VOTING YES SO MOTION CARRIES. A THAT COMPLETES OUR BUSINESS BUT AS USUAL WE ALWAYS OFFER OUR CLOSING COMMENTS AND I THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME OF OUR AFTER THIS ACTION. IN I THINK FIRST A LITTLE CONTEXT THAN IT ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS ABOUT THIS IS WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL ITEMS YOU SEE THE ITEMS INDIVIDUALLY BUT THEY REALLY FIT INTO A LARGER ARCHITECTURE AND THERE ARE MUCH AS MUCH ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT THE ITEMS AND SO. IF YOU LOOK AT WORKING OFF THE MAY REVISION. WE REJECTED TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL CORPORATE TARGETED INTERVENTION GRANTS REJECTED THE TWO BILLION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY GRANTS SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF TARGETED INTERVENTION GRANTS ONE BILLION FROM COMMUNITY SCHOOLS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. FROM EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANTS AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ROUGHLY. FROM THE TEACHER PACKAGE AND SO THOSE TOTAL SIX POINT SIX BILLION AND THEN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BASED ON THE MAY REVISED THAT WE HEARD EARLIER. ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS ASSUMING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST REVENUES WHICH REALLY ALLOWED FOR SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION OF ROOM IN THE BUDGET. AND SO THEN WE TO IN THE ACTIONS WE JUST TALK. WE USED TWO POINT SIX BILLION OF THAT TO PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS WE USE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR THE- ARPAD THE FIXING THE EXPANDED LEARNING AFTER SCHOOL- ITEM. EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BASE INCREASE ONE BILLION OTHER SPECIAL EDUCATION RELATED SUPPLEMENTS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOUR. THE AG HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION GRANTS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANTS. AND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION FOR STAGE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AND RATES AND THERE WERE A FEW THINGS SUCH AS CO INCREASES. AND IF YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER FOR THE TO PACKAGE IS VOTE CATER TO AND HIGH RIDGE. IT REALLY ADDRESSES WHAT CAME UP FROM THIS COMMITTEE ON PAYING OFF THE DEFERRALS DON'T WHITE TOLD ECONOMIC DOWNTURN TO PAY OFF DEBT- DO IT NOW. A PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING AND SPECIAL EDUCATION UP IMPROVE UPON THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORTING STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL AFTER SCHOOL CARE AND ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES BY ENSURING THAT MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SUPPORTS AND MAKE OTHER KEY INVESTMENTS IN UNIVERSAL CHILD NUTRITION A. G. COMPLETION IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AMONG. A MANY THINGS IN THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL TOGETHER WITH THE RATE AND SLIGHT INCREASES IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM R. TWO BUILDING BLOCKS TOWARD A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ALL OF OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SYSTEM WILL BE HEARD TOMORROW IN SUB THREE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE AGENDA. ON HIGHER EDUCATION THE SUBCOMMITTEE SECTION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING INSTABILITY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES PRIME PROVIDING A 5% BASE INCREASE ABOVE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEVELS EXTENDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY ONE YEAR THE FISCAL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SENATE THE SUB COMMITTEE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SUPPORT FOR SERVICES THAT HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED IN THEIR EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S- MO JO MACE A POINT TODAY- EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES SAY PEP. INCREASE FUNDING FOR EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAMS AND WE ALSO MAKE LARGE INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY BY INVESTING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS AND COMPENSATION. AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME FACULTY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WOULD BRING THE STATE CLOSER TO REACHING THE GOAL. THAT 75% OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE DELIVERED BY FULL TIME FACULTY AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM A SUCH AS FINANCIAL AID RESIDENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR PRIORITIES OF THE SENATE. THAT WEREN'T HEARD TODAY BUT WILL BE HEARD IN THE FALL BUDGET COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK AND SO. THE FACT THAT A FEW THINGS WORK HERE- BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AND NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED OUR WHEN WE COME OUT OF THIS BUDGET SO. ARM I WANT TO BUT BEFORE. HI AS FOR ANY COMMENTS CLOSING COMMENTS FROM SENATOR MEN AND SENATE RETRO BOAT. THANK EVERYONE THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT ATTENDED OUR THIRTEEN HEARINGS AND GAVE US FEEDBACK. AND THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE MET WITH OUR BECAUSE WE MET HAD COUNTLESS COUNTLESS MEETINGS WITH STUDENTS FACULTY PARENTS. OF HANDS- MANAGERS OF EVERY LEVEL OF SCHOOL SYSTEM AND HAVE WORKED THROUGH THORNY ISSUES AND WHILE THE FINAL BUDGET MIGHT REFINE THIS MORE IN THE GOVERNOR WILL WEIGH IN IN CERTAIN WAYS. I THINK THIS IS A STRONG BASE. THE SORT OF TAKE WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS FISCAL SITUATION BUDGET FOR IMPACT AND FILL IN HOLES ACROSS THE BUDGET SOME VERY PLEASED OF WITH THIS OUTCOME. LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING STATEMENTS SENATOR MEN AND THEN CENTER- TROUBLE. THANK YOU CAN AMERICA- THE IS. WE'RE NEAR THE END OF GUESS MY FIRST BUT SEASON IS ALLEGED. AND I WILL SAY IT'S BEEN INTERESTING GETTING A GLIMPSE OF HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE- YOU KNOW I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SHERMAN THERE'S POINT ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE THERE ARE. ITEMS IN THIS PACKAGE THAT. I THOUGHT I MIGHT NOT HAVE. PICTORAL CHOSEN FROM SCRATCH BUT OVERALL I THINK THE DIRECTION OF THIS- BUDGET FOR. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE IN HIGHER ED IS A VERY VERY STRONG PACKAGE- AND ONE I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT. YOU KNOW I THINK FOR ME MOST IMPORTANT WAS THAT WE- PAID OFF THE DEFERRALS AND RESTORE THE CUTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION- THOSE AT AND GAVE AN ADDITIONAL COAL INCREASE I THINK THAT HAS TO BE THE BASELINE- WELL I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S AN URGE TO EARMARK FUNDS FOR PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. I THINK PRINCIPLES OF FISSION SEEM LOCAL CONTROL DICTATE THAT WE TRY TO GIVE THOSE IN WHO KNOW THE DETAILS OF EDUCATION THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE ALLEY AS- YOU COP IN THE CSU SYSTEM AND THEIR CAMPUSES- THE FUNDING AND FLEXIBILITY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS APPROPRIATELY AND I THINK THIS BUDGET DOES A LOT OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE- AND I GUESS I JUST. EMPHASIZE THE BROADER POINT HERE WHICH IS THIS IS A MASSIVE INVESTMENT EDUCATION AND THAT'S AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE. OUR ECONOMY TODAY THE FACT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH VERY VERY HIGH TAX REVENUES THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT'S WITHSTOOD A GENERATIONAL PANDEMIC IS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE IN EDUCATION THE PAST. BOTH OF THE CATO TWELVE LEVEL AND I'M A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS MYSELF I AND I WENT TO AN EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOL AND WE SHOULD OFFER THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY YOUNG CHILD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY IN RCS USED COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN HOUSTON UC'S WHICH ARE PROVIDED SO MUCH OF THE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION THAT HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY IN THE STATE AND SO I I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS BUDGET I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT IN-EDUCATION AND I HOPE THAT THIS. CONTINUES TO MARK A TREND WHERE WE DON'T DE EMPHASIZING NEGLECT OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A SENATE ROADSHOW BLOKE. HELLO GOOD. M. THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORT.
