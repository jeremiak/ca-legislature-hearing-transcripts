HELLO EVERYONE WELCOME TO THE CONVENING OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SESSION OF THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MADAM PRESIDENT PRO TEM THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF INVITING ME TO PRESIDE TODAY AND FOR YOUR COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. MADAM SECRETARY ERICA CONTRARIES THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR SERVICE HERE TODAY. IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE SO MANY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES BACK TOGETHER AFTER MANY MONTHS APART AND EVEN THOUGH WE CAN ONLY SEE THE TOP HALF OF EACH OTHER'S FACES OUR OLD COLLEAGUES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE TO ONE ANOTHER. TO ALL THE NEW MEMBERS CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ELECTION AND WELCOME TO YOUR NEW OFFICE IN THE SENATE CHAMBERS. AND TO ALL THOSE PARTICIPATING FROM HOME WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN PERSON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS AGO JUST BEFORE I WAS SWORN IN AS UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR. I WAS VISITING THE OPS CENTER IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S MAIN BUILDING IN WASHINGTON DC. THE OPS CENTER SHARPER OPERATIONS CENTER. IS A WINDOW LIST SERIES OF ROOMS WHERE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICERS ARE ON DUTY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY MONITORING GLOBAL EVENTS IN REAL TIME. HURRICANES WARS MILITARY FLARE UPS AIRPLANE CRASHES REFUGEE MIGRATIONS IT'S THE OPS CENTER JOB TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR BIG SUDDEN PROBLEMS. AND THEN ALERT THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAPPEN. AS I LOOKED AROUND THE CENTRAL ROOM I NOTICED A LARGE WHITE BOARD WE'RE IN GIANT LETTERS SOMEONE HAD WRITTEN H. ONE N. ONE. H. ONE N. ONE ALSO CALLED THE SWINE FLU WAS GENETICALLY THE CLOSEST STRAIN OF FLU TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN PANDEMIC THAT THE WORLD HAD SEEN SINCE. THE CDC NOW ESTIMATES THAT SIXTY MILLION AMERICANS ABOUT ONE IN FIVE OF US WERE INFECTED WITH THE H. ONE AND ONE. ON THE DAY I STOOD IN THE OP CENTER PEOPLE WERE REALLY WORRIED HOW BAD WOULD IT BE HOUSE SICK WOULD PEOPLE GET HOW FAST WITH THE VIRUS SPREAD. FORTUNATELY WE WOULD SOON DISCOVER THAT THE H. ONE N. ONE VIRUS WELL HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS AND DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN. DIDN'T MAKE PEOPLE VERY SICK AND WITH LESS DEADLY THAN THE FLU. THE WORLD GOT LUCKY. SEVERAL YEARS LATER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LARGEST OUTBREAK OF THE EBOLA VIRUS OCCURRED IN WEST AFRICA. THIS TIME THE VIRUS WAS EXTREMELY DEADLY AN AVERAGE OF 50% OF THOSE WHO CONTRACTED EBOLA DIED BUT UNLIKE H. ONE N. ONE EBOLA IS FAR LESS CONTAGIOUS IT'S HARDER TO CATCH REQUIRING VERY CLOSE PHYSICAL CONTACT TO SPREAD. WE JUST HEALTH WORKERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES MOBILIZED AND WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE DISEASE AND MINIMIZE THE SPREAD. JUST ELEVEN CASES AVAILABLE LAST MADE IT TO THE US. AGAIN THE WORLD GOT LUCKY. I'M SHARING THIS WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE SOMEONE WHO SERVED AS A SENIOR US GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE KNEW THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN THE WORLD EXPERIENCED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT WOULD BE BOTH VERY LETHAL AND HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS. WE ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO BE FULLY PREPARED AND TELL WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS CONTEXT I AM VERY PROUD OF CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. FROM THE BEGINNING WE BELIEVE THE SCIENCE WE HAD FAITH IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WE HAD THE COURAGE TO ISSUE THE FIRST STATE WIDE STAY AT HOME ORDER IN THE COUNTRY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIANS HAVE AND CONTINUE TO HAVE FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. AND ARE DOING THEIR PART TO STOP THE SPREAD. TODAY WE MOURN THE TRAGIC LOSS OF TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND GRIEVE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THOSE LOST BUT WE SHOULD NOTE THAT WITHOUT THE SWIFT DECISIVE RESPONSE FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THE SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER SPIKE IN COVERT NINETEEN CASES WITH THE RECORD THIRTY THOUSAND NEW CASES YESTERDAY. HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE BRACING FOR MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS BUSINESSES ARE BRACING FOR A NEW ROUND OF CLOSURES. BUT THIS TIME THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL VACCINES ARE ON THEIR WAY AND AS WE PREPARE FOR ANOTHER DIFFICULT FEW WEEKS IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND OUR STATE HEALTH OFFICIALS. ARE HARD AT WORK PLANNING THE DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES FIRST AND FOREMOST TO OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS THEN TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEN TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE. AS WE OPEN THE SENATE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSION THE WORK OF THIS BODY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE MARCH FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE MANY BUSINESSES HAVE SHUTTERED WHILE OTHERS HANG ON BY A THREAD. WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED MOST OF OUR CHILDREN WLL MISS AN ENTIRE YEAR IN PERSON LEARNING. AND JUST AS THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY COVERT NINETEEN AWAIT YOUR ACTION SO DO PERSISTENT PROBLEMS THAT OUR STATE HAS STRUGGLED WITH FOR YEARS HOUSING SHORTAGES AND HOMELESSNESS WILDFIRES INCOME INEQUALITY CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO MANY OTHERS. IT'S A LOT BUT YOU ARE UP TO IT. TODAY AS IT HAPPENS IS DECEMBER SEVENTH A DAY THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY FOR SEVENTY YEARS AGO US NAVAL FORCES WERE ATTACKED AT PEARL HARBOR. AS WE REMEMBER THE VETERANS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE VETERANS OF ALL OUR MILITARY ENGAGEMENTS LET US ALSO DRAW FROM THE COURAGE AND RESILIENCE THAT THEY HAD. WITH HARD WORK PERSISTENCE COMMON PURPOSE AND ROBUST DEBATE LET'S SET THE BEST POSSIBLE EXAMPLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WE PROUDLY SERVE. EVEN WITH OUR OWN SHORT COMINGS AND HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS. FINALLY IT LET ME JUST NOTE THAT VERY SOON WE WILL HAVE A NEW GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON DC A NEW PRESIDENT AND JOE BIDEN AT THE VERY FIRST WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OUR VERY OWN DAUGHTER OF CALIFORNIA. KAMALA HARRIS. THE DAYS AHEAD FOR US AS A STATE AND FOR OUR NATION WILL BE CHALLENGING AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH WHAT WE HOPE IS THE HOME STRETCH OF THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS BODY AND THE DETERMINATION AND COMMITMENT OF OUR PEOPLE I TRULY BELIEVE CALIFORNIA WILL EMERGE STRONGER THAN EVER.

WE ASK YOU TO GRANT RELIEF TO THE ELDERLY WHO DEPEND ON THE GENTLENESS AND KINDNESS OF OTHERS TO CARE FOR THEM.

GIVE THEM POLITICAL COURAGE TO CREATE LAWS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMON GOOD. GIVE THEM BROAD VISION AND HOLY WISDOM TO HELP THEM PERSEVERE THROUGH DAYS OF UNCERTAINTY AND STRUGGLE.

YOU BOTH ONEROUS WITH YOUR PRESENCE HERE IN THE SENATE TODAY AND WE THANK YOU. IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE THE SENATE FOR THE COMING YEAR IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE A PHYSICAL QUORUM TODAY HERE ON THE FLOOR. SO HERE WE ARE. TO PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL TASK OF SWEARING IN SENATORS AND ELECTING OUR. ENDING SECRETARY OF THE SENATE ERICA CONTRARIUS ARE BRAND NEW LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL KEROGEN KIDS. AND I'M DELIGHTED TO ADD VOTING TO MAKE OUR INTERIM CHIEF KATRINA REPAIR CHRIS OUR NEW CHIEF SERGEANT AT ARMS THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THESE OUTSTANDING WOMEN I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE FORGIVE ME BERNIE. BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT TO RECOGNIZE BERNADETTE MCNULTY OUR CHIEF ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SENATE. DURING THE INTERIM BERNIE RECEIVE THE TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE STAFF ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF LEGISLATIVE CLERKS AND SECRETARIES. I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO RECOGNIZE HER THE SOONEST THAT WE POSSIBLY COULD BE BACK TOGETHER. AND YOU ARE OF COURSE AWARE OF ALL OF THE PRECAUTIONS THE SENATE HAS TAKEN TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF SENATORS OF OUR STAFF AND VISITORS TO THE CAPITAL. AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CHANGED OUR DOING SWEARING IN DAY AND THAT'S OKAY. WHEN OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE DELAYING WEDDINGS AND GRADUATIONS AND OTHER IMPORTANT LIFE EVENTS THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE UNDERSTANDS. AND WILL GLADLY TAKE A PASS ON SOME OF THE POP IN CIRCUMSTANCE. THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY ENJOY. IN THE COMING YEAR THE SENATE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON COVE IN NINETEEN ON ECONOMIC RELIEF AND RECOVERY. AND ON ADDRESSING CHRONIC CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THIS CRISIS. TO THAT END I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT SOME OF THE VERY FIRST BILLS INTRODUCED TODAY WILL BE THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY FOR YEARS AND IT'S BEEN MADE EVEN WORSE IN EVERY PART OF OUR STATE BYCHKOVA NINETEEN. SO HOUSING WILL BE BACK EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND WILDFIRE RESPONSE WILL BE BACK. EFFORTS TO END THE HARM OF FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM WILL BE BACK. BROADBAND ACCESS WILL BE BACK. SO NO KIDDING CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK. AND A TACO BELL PARKING LOT. I'M ALSO SURE YOUR DISTRICT OFFICES HAVE BEEN AS BUSY AS MINE. HELPING CALIFORNIANS NAVIGATE DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES AT EDT. WE WILL CONTINUE DELIVERING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXAMINE HOW THEIR EXPERIENCE CAN BE IMPROVED AND NOT JUST IN TIMES OF CRISIS. WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING I COULDN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT MY FRIEND ALBERT IN A LOS AL WAS A MUSICIAN. HE WAS ALSO IN THE ARMY STATIONED IN HAWAII IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE. OUR WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE BASE WHEN THE FIRST ATTACK AT PEARL HARBOR SEVENTY NINE YEARS AGO TODAY. HE SAID YOU COULD SEE THE PILOTS FACES. HE SPENT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP RELAYING MESSAGES BETWEEN OFFICERS AND AIRFIELDS ON HIS MOTORCYCLE. I CAN'T HELP BUT INTERJECT RIGHT HERE THAT TODAY IN THIS CHAMBER. WE HAVE SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO SERVED US AS VETERANS HERE TODAY SEVEN. THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN DECADES THE REPUBLICAN LEADER AND I WERE DISCUSSING THAT AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE IN THE SENATE HAVE A CAUCUS OF OUR OWN. VETERANS ODD TO REALLY COMMEMORATE THIS DAY. I KNOW THAT BOTH THE REPUBLICAN LEADER IN IRAN CREDIBLY PROUD OF THAT FACT. SO ON THIS DAY DECEMBER SEVENTH I WAS THINKING ABOUT AL AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GREATEST GENERATION AND THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY MADE BOTH OVERSEAS AND HERE AT HOME. THEY MAY DO WITH RATIONED FOOD GAS AND TIRES THEY SAY GREASE AND FOOD SCRAPS AND THEY LED NEIGHBORHOOD DRAWS TO COLLECT PAPER TEN AND OTHER MATERIALS. THEY ALSO BUILD QUALITY EMERGENCY HOUSING TO TAKE CARE OF THE WORKERS NEEDED FOR THE WAR EFFORT. AND THEY PROVIDED CHILD CARE AND OTHER VITAL SERVICES TO HELP ALL THE ROSIE THE RIVETERS WHO IT ENTERED THE WORK FORCE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO TODAY TO WEAR MASKS TO AVOID LARGE GROUPS. TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME. THAT'S NOT A LOT TO ASK COMPARE TO THE SACRIFICES OTHERS HAVE MADE FOR THE GREATER GOOD. AND IT IS NOT A LOT FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ASK THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AS LEGISLATORS AND AS INDIVIDUALS TO READ KATE THE SIX CENTRAL THREAT TO OUR LOVED ONES OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR ECONOMY. WE OWE IT TO EACH OTHER TO THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US AND THOSE WHO WILL COME AFTER US TO MEET THESE TOUGH TIMES WITH THE SAME KIND OF COURAGE SACRIFICE AND DETERMINATION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DISPLAYED SO MANY TIMES. THERE IS MUCH THAT MUST BE DONE AND I BELIEVE WE WILL DO IT. THERE WILL ALSO BE MUCH TO CELEBRATE ESPECIALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR. PLEASE KNOW THAT MY SPOUSE JENNIFER AND I WISH ALL OF YOU AND YOURS THE HAPPIEST OF HOLIDAYS AND A PRODUCTIVE REWARDING. AND BORING. TWENTY TWENTY ONE.
