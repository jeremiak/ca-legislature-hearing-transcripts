YOU'RE OUR FIRST AUTHOR. VERY MUCH WILL GET STARTED ON YEAH WILL -- YES AND WILL START IS IT WE HAVE AGREED TO START IS SUBCOMMITTEE -- WAIT SANTIAGO AS WELL SANTIAGO I'M AFRAID SIGNED UP. FOR THE ARMY. IT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT WE'LL START WITH MR CHEER. AND I'M THRILLED. ALL RIGHT SO MR CHU HAS ITEM NUMBER. TWO AB FIVE OH EIGHT DRINKING WATER CONSOLIDATION AND EXTENSION OF SERVICE DOMESTIC WELLS [inaudible] SELECT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I EFFORTS WILL LIKE TO STEP TO COMMITMENT COMP COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH -- A MY MY OFFICE ON THIS. AB FIVE ZERO EIGHT BILLS ON CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING EFFORT TO PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. BALL ALL CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL. IMPROVED ON EXISTING WATER BORE PROCESSES CREATED UNDER AB TWENTY FIVE ALL ONE TO DELIVERY. TO DELIVERING SAFE WATER TO SMALL COMMITTEE THE BUT ALL CALLS TO THE WATER DISTRICT. AND SO THIS BILL. A OF THIS THIS BILL -- A. B. FIVE OH EIGHT REQUIRES TO DADE DURING THE PUBLIC OUTREACH AND CONSIDERING ALTERED CONSIDERATION. CONSOLIDATIONS OR EXTENSION OF THE SERVICES. THE WATER BOARD INFORMED TO RESIDENTS IF THE OWNER OF THE DON'T DAHLE MASTIC WILL OR TWO WELDING IS WITHHOLDING CONSENT TO THE STATE FUNDED CONSOLIDATION OR EXPANSION OF SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL PROHIBIT REACHED THE RECEIVING WATER SYSTEM FROM CHARGER IN THE STATE. THE FEED MEANT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT WHEN A PROJECT ARMED MEN TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO EXISTING COMMUNITY. THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT MAKES SENSE HOWEVER DEALS CONSOLIDATION EFFORT ALWAYS TO EXISTING COMEY CONSUMMATED HE'S AND HE'S FEES TAKE AWAY THE STATE RESOURCES. THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER. IF WE ALLOW RECEIVING WATERS SYSTEMS TO CHARGE A FEE WERE NOT APPROPRIATE. WE RUN THE RISK OF THE PROJECT GREEN TOO COSTLY FOR THE STATE TO PURSUE. A HALTING POTENTIAL PROJECTS AND LEAVING RESIDENTS WITH ALL **** TO STATE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THIS BILL IS WORKING TO REDUCE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS RETURN TO SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER. AB FIVE ZERO A IS SPONSORED BY THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. A POLICY LINK CLEAN WATER ACTION COMEDY WATER CENTER AND OTHERS WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- MICHAEL CLAIBORNE FROM THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO GIVE SOME MORE BACKGROUND IN SUPPORTING OFF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME IS MIKE CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP FOR COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BASED IN FRESNO WITH -- AN OFFICE IN EAST COACHELLA AS WELL -- I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S A DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS STATE LACKS ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND A BIG PORTION OF THE PROBLEM IS ATTRIBUTED TO HOUSEHOLDS RELIANT ON DOMESTIC WELLS WHICH SERVE NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE -- AND ARE TYPICALLY IS SHALLOWER THAN MUNICIPAL WELLS SO ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AS WELL AS DROUGHT IMPACTS. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS SPURRED ON BY THE TRANSFER OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM TO THE STATE WATER BOARD IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AS WELL AS THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY EIGHT AND IT AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE IN RECENT YEARS WHICH EXPANDED THE AUTHORITY OF THE WATER BOARD TO ORDER EXTENSIONS. OF SAFE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS TO COMMUNITIES THAT LACK SAFE DRINKING WATER. SINCE PASSAGE OF TWENTY FIVE A ONE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL. WAYS IN WHICH THE PROCESS FOR MANDATING EXTENSION OF SERVICE CAN BE IMPROVED. AN EXAMPLE FOR THE NEED OF FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IS PROVIDED BY A COMMUNITY CALLED TOMBSTONE TERRITORY -- WHICH IS IN FRESNO COUNTY AND LESS THAN A MILE FROM THE CITY LATER AND LIMITS OF THE CITY OF SANGER -- THE COMMUNITY PRESENTLY LACKS ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER -- THEY HAVE NITRATES IN THEIR PRIVATE WELLS THEY ALSO OF TCP. AND BACTERIA. BECAUSE OF THIS CONTAMINATION RESIDENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED -- EXTENSION OF SERVICE FROM THE CITY OF SAYING -- AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THE WAY THE WITH THE RELEVANT STATUTE READS PRESENTLY -- THE STATE MUST. AS A FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THE OWNERS OF DOMESTIC WELLS AND THE UNIT SERVED BY DOMESTIC WELLS. AB FIVE OH EIGHT WOULD MOVE THAT REQUIREMENT DOWN TO LATER IN THE PROCESS TO BE PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEASIBILITY STUDY. AND THE IDEA THERE IS TO NOT CUT OFF -- PROJECT AND PRIVATE RELEVANT INFORMATION TO DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO BUILD SUPPORT -- SIMILARLY THE BILL WOULD. ALSO REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO HOUSEHOLDS SERVED BY DOMESTIC WELLS BOTH OWNERS AND THE CURRENT OCCUPANTS OF THE WATER QUALITY PROBLEM. IMPACTS THE HEALTH AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDING EXTENSION OF SERVICE FROM A NEARBY WATER SYSTEM. FINALLY WHEN CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICE IS MANDATED THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT CAPACITY FEES MET SERVE NEW DEVELOPMENT. ARE NOT CHARGED TO THE STATE. IN HOLD THE BILL WOULD MAKE THE PROCESS FOR EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICE BOTH MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE EFFICIENT. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT.

SEVEN SEVEN OKAY -- NEXT WE HAVE MISTER MULLIN. HE HAS A V.. FIFTEEN ZERO NINE SOLID WASTE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SENATOR HILL AND I INTRODUCED AB FIFTEEN OH NINE IN RESPONSE TO A FIRE CAUSED BY A LITHIUM ION BATTERY AT THE SHORE WAY FACILITY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WHICH CAUSED EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES. THAT SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY FOR NINETY DAYS AND TOOK OVER A YEAR TO RESTORE MAKE A MOTION WITH THE BELT. WITH OVER A HALF MILLION LITHIUM ION BATTERY SOLD LAST YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF BATTERIES ON THE MARKET EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS THE QUANTITY OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES FOUND OF THE WASTE STREAM WILL ONLY INCREASE. AND THE RISK OF FUTURE FIRES ALONG WITH IT. AB FIFTEEN OH NINE WOULD CREATE A RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR BOTH LOOSE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AND THOSE EMBEDDED IN PRODUCTS. TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF IN THE WASTE STREAM. THIS BILL ADOPTS A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY MODEL THAT ASKED BATTERY AND PRODUCT MAKERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR PRODUCTS. THIS MODEL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE PRODUCTS DESPITE ALL OF THEIR PORT APPLICATIONS AND USES. HAVE A SIGNIFICANT END OF LIFE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THE MANUFACTURER MUST HELP MITIGATE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE END OF LIFE CONSEQUENCE FOR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ITS FIRES THAT ARE PUBLICLY FINANCED THE SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WE LEARNED IN SAN MATEO COUNTY THE STATUS QUO PUTS THOSE FACILITIES AND THE WORKERS TO STAFF THEM AT REAL RISK. PLEASE JOIN MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PENCIL AND I TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AVOID ANY MORE FIRES IN OUR COUNTY OR ANYWHERE ELSE. IN OUR STATE AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE LIST OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IT'S REALLY IS A STATE WIDE CONCERN. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OR NINE AND NOW ALTERNATE MY WITNESSES FOR ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AND TO ANSWER AND A TECHNICAL QUESTION. FOUR MINUTES YOU CAN DIVIDE IT UP AS YOU LIKE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOE Là MERIONETH I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF REACH THINK WASTE WHICH IS A SOLID WASTE. JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY ON THE SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA WE HAVE TWELVE MEMBER AGENCIES BETWEEN EAST PALO ALTO IN BURLINGAME -- AND WE ALSO INCLUDE THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO IN A SANITARY DISTRICT. WE HAVE FIRST EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES I'VE GOT SEVERAL EXAMPLES HERE -- OF THE THE GROWING CONCERN HERE THIS IS THIS IS THE BEFORE THIS IS THE AFTER -- WHEN THESE MATERIALS ARE NOT HANDLED RESPONSIBLY -- THEY CAN. GO INTO THE HIGHLY MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE TO SORT AND PROCESS MATERIALS -- AT THAT TIME IT'S VERY COMMON FOR THAT TO GO IN BETWEEN -- THE MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT AND THE THE SAFETY. SAFETY COATINGS ARE BREACHED AND FIRE COMES OUT SO WE HAD AN EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR FIRE ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PLANT WAS CLOSED FOR ALMOST FOUR MONTHS. IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO GET BACK ON TRACK -- DURING THAT TIME ABOUT FIFTY WORKERS WERE FURLOUGHED DURING THE HOLIDAYS WHICH IS VERY AND FORTUNE I AM VERY HAPPY TO SAY NO ONE WAS INJURED. THEY FOLLOWED THE EVACUATION. PROCEDURES TO A TEE SO ONCE THEY REALIZE THE FIRE GOT AWAY FROM THEM THEY THEY GOT OUT OF THE PLANT WHICH WAS AMAZING -- BUT MORE TO THE POINT -- NOT ONLY IS THERE A WORKER SAFETY ISSUE INVOLVED BUT THE FACILITY ITSELF IS AT RISK AT SERIOUS RISK SO FOR US -- OR INSURANCE PROVIDER -- WORKED WITH US RIGHT TO THE END THEY PAID EVERYTHING THEY WERE OBLIGATED TO DO AND THEN THEY FIRED US. THEY FIRED AS THEY WALKED AWAY THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GETTING IN THIS CATEGORY OF COVERAGE ANYMORE. SO WE NOW HAVE SEVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES -- PROVIDING COVERAGE WHERE WE HAD ONE BEFORE OUR PREMIUMS HAVE TRIPLED OUR OUR COVERAGE -- WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN LET ME TELL YOU. SO I DEFINITELY WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE'VE TAKEN MANY MANY -- I INTERNAL STEPS WITHIN THE FACILITY TO IMPLEMENT -- FIRE SUPPRESSION EQUIPMENT HIGHER LEVEL OF TRAINING ECCENTRICITY WERE MORE PREPARED IF AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE THE KEY POINT IS WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY -- WE ARE SEEING A VERY STEEP INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THESE MATERIALS THAT WE GET IN OUR FACILITIES AND PUTTING OUR WORKERS AT RISK AND THE FACILITY AT RISK SO -- WE JUST DID A COUNTY AND IT'S LITERALLY DOUBLED FROM A YEAR AGO -- WE'RE CURRENTLY GETTING ELEVEN BATTERIES AND OUR EVERYONE OF THESE REPRESENTS A COMBUSTIBLE OPPORTUNITY. AND THE BEING ON OUR SIDE OF THE FENCE -- IT'S TIME FOR ACTION WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO -- WILL NOT ONLY THREE MINUTES. THE MAY PASS WE SHOULD HAVE TIME FOR THE OTHER WITNESS YES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT JASON SMELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS YOU'RE CHIEF. MAKE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS AM J. O. ALREADY GAVE YOU A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND FOCUS ON WHAT'S IN THE BILL OKAY. AB FIFTEEN OR NINE ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHES A WITH THE MY ON RECYCLING PROGRAM INSIDE CAL RECYCLE IT TREATS LOOSE BATTERIES AND BATTERIES THAT ARE EMBEDDED INSIDE OF A PRODUCT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- FOR BATTERIES INSIDE OF A PRODUCT TO CREATE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS COMPLIANCE FOR THESE BATTERIES IT DOESN'T EXTENDED PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY PROBLEM. BOTH OF THESE KIND OF FALL UNDER THE GUISE OF PRODUCER SPOTS ABILITY AND I WANTED VERY QUICKLY MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY. MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PARTICULAR OUTCOME. IF YOU REMEMBER WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE EPR ESSENTIALLY FOCUSES ON PRODUCTS THAT AT THE END OF LIFE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND OF LIFE IMPACT FALLING OF BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES -- ENVIRONMENTAL LIKE MERCURY THERMOSTATS PUBLIC HEALTH LIKE DRUGS AND SHARPS OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LIKE SHARPS I AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COSTS LIKE MATTRESSES AND CARPET THINGS LIKE THAT. VIEW MY A BATTERIES FRANKLY CHECK A BUNCHOF THE DIFFERENT BOXES HERE IT'S NOT CONDITIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARD LOCAL GOVERNMENT COSTA SIGNIFICANTLY ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES IS PRETTY. INCREDIBLE WHEN THESE FACILITIES BURNHAM AND THAT ALL THAT STUFF -- WE FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS BILL WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT AND I DO WANT TO MENTION THE OPPOSITION LETTERS VERY QUICKLY NOT FOR WHAT THEY SAY ALTHOUGH I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND ANYTHING THAT THEY DO SAY BUT THERE'S THREE THINGS VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT. THEY DO NOT SAY. THE LETTERS DO NOT SAY THAT THE BATTERIES. ARE NOT DANGEROUS. THEY DO NOT SAY THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE NOT STARTING THESE FIRES AND THEY DO NOT SAY THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OUTCOME OF THOSE FIRES SO WE WOULD SAY. PLEASE VOTE YES ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH NINE HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ABOUT THIS OF CALIFORNIANS WASTE WERE ACTUALLY CO SPONSORING THE BILL THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS AND OUR DRIVER THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON GREEN I'M WITH SANITATION DISTRICTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ALSO HAVE FACILITIES SIMILAR TO RETHINK WASTE AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU.

WE APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD OPERATE AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS ON THOSE PROGRAM MECHANICS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DEPOSIT BASE SYSTEM WORKS FOR CONSUMERS WHERE IT'S EASY FOR CONSUMERS TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK. AS EASY AS IT IS TO PAY INTO PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW WITH THE OPPOSITION LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND STATE THEIR CONCERNS. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF OF P. R. BA THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY ASSOCIATION. OUR LETTER WAS CERTAINLY LATE SO IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO GET INTO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DETAIL TODAY. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AUTHORS PLURAL TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL. AND OTHER THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. POSITION EMILY PAPPAS FOR H. P. INK WE'VE BEEN A STEWARD AND BATTERY TAKE BACK FOR FOR BEFORE A CAR WAS A THING WHEN WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND HIS STAFF OF AS WE HAVE BEEN SINCE DAY ONE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SCENE NINE GREAT MISTER DALI. FIRST OWNERS THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS EITHER THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO JUSTICE ISSUE -- I DID HAVE A BATTERY IRON WITHIN BATTERY LAST YEAR AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE SAME LINES I JUST KIND OF CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW IT'S GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED I DID FOR ME SO -- WHEN WE HAVE THE EVEN THE? C. R. V. RETURN AND AND THE ONE SIZE DOESN'T REALLY FIT ALL IN SOME OF THE AREAS ESPECIALLY THE VERY RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. A SIR CAN YOU CAN JUST GIVE ME AN IDEA. OF WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE AND HOW WOULD LOOK FOR THE THE PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MADAM MY GOAL HERE IS NOT TO BE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE BUT TO PROVIDE A MENU OF OPTIONS TO SORT OF COMPLY WITH. WITH THIS THING THIS A COMPLICATED -- AREA. OF PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION BUT I WOULD LIKE -- TO BRING JASON IF HE CAN JUST TALK GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY. SEE YOU AND TALK INTO THE MIKE AT THE SAME TIME -- EPR PROGRAMS IN THE BUT THE BATTERY RECYCLING PROGRAM AT ALTERNATELY BE THICK PART OF PART OF A PLAN THAT'S APPROVED BY CAL RECYCLE AND IN THOSE PLANS THEY ESSENTIALLY GO BACK AND SHOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE COVERAGE FOR THE STATE. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANIES IN THEIR STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM TO PLAN -- FOR JUST LIKE THEY DO ON THE EXISTING PROGRAMS WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THESE PROGRAMS IN THE PAST. BUT THE GOOD NEWS THERE IS -- WERE LEARNING -- AND WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO WORK AROUND SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DEVELOPING THE BILLS AND THAT'S WHAT OUR INTENT IS HERE. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO -- MISS MULLIN AND YOU CLOSE FOR WE HAVE A LIST OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. I WON'T ASK YOU TO READ THROUGH THEM ALL NOW -- BUT I ASSUME YOU AND YOUR STAFF OF LOOKED AT THEM -- AS A SERIES OF YESES NOTED ON THE ID AND ALICE'S WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD SIGN THEIR NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED RIGHT ON THAT WE THINK. WE ARE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN PROPERLY. ADDRESS YOU CAN REALLY THIS IS THIS IS MOTIVATED MISTER CHAIR BY A RECOGNITION THAT THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT SAFETY IS AT RISK. ARM AND THIS IS ABOUT -- NOT ONLY DISCONCERTED A STATEWIDE CONCERN AND A AND A CLEAR -- MISSION IN THE WAY WE DEAL WITH THESE THINGS THAT'S RESULTING IN FIRES AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASING PROBLEM SO. I'LL BUT IN TERMS OF THAT SOME OF THE DETAILS I IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN ADDRESS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS. ISSUES RAISED GOING FORWARD GOOD -- AS WITH THE A LOT OF BILLS WE DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BE PERFECT IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE -- ISSUES ARE RAISED AND THEY TAKE TIME TO WORK OUT -- SO I THINK THOUGH THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE ONE IS GOING TO BE GETTING THE PUBLIC TO COMPLY -- BECAUSE TO REFER TO NOT HAVE THESE FIRES YOU'RE GONNA NEED. MUCH BETTER COMPLIANCE THAN WE HAVE WITH OTHER PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULD BE HAVING SOME SORT OF A AND AGAIN. I'M JUST TALKING HERE -- BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE -- ADVERTISING -- NOT UP PERHAPS LOOKING AT ALL THE BATTERY PROGRAMS -- TOGETHER SINCE. SINCE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF ISSUES BUT THIS IS ONE THAT CERTAINLY KEY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT MORE FIRES IN. RISKING OF HELP OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S SEE WE HAVE A MOTION. AS FROM MISTER. LET'S SEE ABOUT. FROM OUR QUE HAN SECOND BYE. BYE KALRA -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB FIFTEEN OH NINE MULLIN. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ KALRA. KALRA I BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] DALY. DALY NOT VOTING CRISTINA GARCIA. HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE. THIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING TO CHANGE WHAT I TO GI. IT HAS FOUR ONE MILLION -- ONE MORE. THANKS SIR. WE ARE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] CAN CAN. MISTER KALRA. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL SO THIS IS AB SIX FOUR SEVEN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HAS MEDIC SAFETY DOCUMENTS -- AND MR OUR PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB SIX FORTY SEVEN FORTY TODAY. SB SIX FORTY SEVEN REQUIRE COSMETIC AND DISINFECT MANUFACTURES WHO ALREADY ARE REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. TO CREATE IMPROVISING TO DATA SHEETS TO DO SO ONLINE AND TRANSLATED DEPARTMENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY SOMEONE PROFESSIONALS. SB DATA SHEET IS A DOCUMENT THAT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT A SUBSTANCE OR MIXTURE FOR USE IN WORKPLACE CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT. AND REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED IN A USER FRIENDLY FORMAT. AS YOU MAY KNOW CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW REQUIRES MANY FACTORS CRITICISM HE DID AS SHE AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO SALONS. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE USED AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT HAZARDS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND TO OBTAIN ADVICE ON SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. SOMEONE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS MANY WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS RIGHT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS OF INFORMATION. THEY ALSO HIRE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS NON EMPLOYEE STATUS MAY DENY THEM THE RIGHT TO DEMAND A SEPARATE DATA SHEET. WHICH LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OF INFORMATION AS WELL. CB DID DID ISSUES ARE CURRENTLY PRODUCED IN HARD COPY FORM AND MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH WHICH CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY SLAM RECORD ACCESS TO DO A LANGUAGE BARRIER OR THE DOCUMENT GETTING LOST MONTHS OTHER SAFETY DATA SHEETS. SB SIX FORTY SUBMIT ONLY REQUIRE MANY FACTORS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW TO CREATE A SAFETYDATA SHEET TO POST ONLINE AND OF THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW ALREADY TO CREATIVITY SHEET. TO POST ONLINE AND TRANSLATE INTO THE MOST COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN BUT THIS ONE WORKERS. BY ALLOWING STUPIDITY SHEETS TO BE ACCESSIBLE ONLINE INCREASES TRANSPARENCY AND REYES A SAFETY AWARENESS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR SALON PROFESSIONALS. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED CONCERNS MINISTRY OPPOSITION I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SALON PROFESSIONALS HAVE ACCESS TO CP DATASHEETS AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE NEW DATA SHE'S TO BE CREATED BY SOME POSSIBLY ASK MANUFACTURE SUPPOSED TO SAY PETITIONS ONLINE AND TRANSLATE AND UPON OF LANGUAGES. CALMLY SPOKEN BY SALON BROKERS AS THE BILL MOVES FLORIDA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION SURROUNDED THEIR CONCERNS BRING CLARITY TO THE BILL. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TEST MONEY ARE CATHERINE PORTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH A HEALTHY MEALS LONG COLLABORATIVE AND LOCK NGUYEN NAIL SALON WORKER AND TRANSLATE PEARL BE. YOUNG WHEN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU COULD TAKE A TWO MINUTES ARE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL ALLOW TWO MINUTES IN [inaudible] OUR THE NATIVE LANGUAGE FOR THE SECOND -- PERSON AND WE WON'T COUNT THE TRANSLATION TOWARDS THE TIME. GO AHEAD THANK YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I CAN'T I AM CATHERINE PORTER THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HELPING ELSE LONG COLLABORATIVE. WE WORK TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND RIGHTS FOR THE PREDOMINATELY VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE NAIL SALONS. OUR ORGANIZATION AND THE ORGANISATION WORK SAFE ON WHOSE BEHALF I ALSO SPEAK TODAY ARE THE CO SPONSORS OF AB. SIX FOUR SEVEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA NAY ALLEN HERE SALON WORKERS MANY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. HANDLE A RANGE OF DISINFECTANTS AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS CONTAINING CARCINOGENS CHEMICALS LINKED TO REPRODUCTIVE RESPIRATORY AND OTHER HARM. UNDER EXISTING LAW LET MANUAL LABOR LAW MANUFACTURES MUST DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE HARD COPY SAFETY DATA SHEETS FOR ANY PRODUCT CONTAINING HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THERE ULTIMATELY REQUIRED TO BE AVAILABLE AT WORK PLACES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA SPOKE OUT ABOUT. THESE HARD COPY DOCUMENTS CAN THEY GET LOST IN THE LONG CHAIN OF DISTRIBUTION FOR MANUFACTURED TO OUR DISTRIBUTOR TO SUPPLY STORE ULTIMATELY TO THE OWNER TO HOPEFULLY. THE WORKER THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN -- COUNTY AND CITY COORDINATORS OF LOOKING LOCAL HEALTHY NAIL SALON RECOGNITION PROGRAMS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE A HARD TIME OBTAINING SAFETY DATA SHEETS FROM MANUFACTURERS. AS THEY TRY TO ASSIST NAIL SALONS AND THESE ARE IN CENTER OF LOCAL BASED PROGRAMS -- THEN ONCE THEY'RE OBTAINED LANGUAGE IS OFTEN A BARRIER TO THE SAFETY AND HEALTH INFORMATION THEY CONTAIN. SO JUST TO REPEAT THE SB SIX FOUR SEVEN ONLY REQUIRES TWO THINGS. WHERE MANUFACTURE ALREADY CREATES A SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR COSMETIC OR DISINFECTANT PUT IT ONLINE? THE OTHER IS. TRANSLATE THOSE SAFETY DATA SHEETS INTO THE LANGUAGE THAT PREDOMINATE IN THE SALON INDUSTRY WE BELIEVE THAT SOME IS A MODEST AND REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO SHINE MORE LIGHT ON THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COSMETICS AND DISINFECTANTS. USE EVERY DAY BY WOMEN SALON WORKERS FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE A YES VOTE ON A. B. SIX FOUR SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN QUIRK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KAREN ROSS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL THE LEADING TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE INDUSTRY. WITH OVER A HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES LOCATED IN STATE -- WHILE WELL INTENDED WE'RE HERE TO OPPOSE AB SIX FOUR SEVEN UNLESS AMENDED -- BASED ON THE EARLIER TESTIMONY I JUST WANT TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT INDUSTRY BELIEVES THAT -- SAFETY DATA SHEET SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO EVERY SALON WORKER AN EMPLOYEE ON THEY SHOULD NOT BE HARD TO ATTAIN -- IT IS FEDERAL LAW THAT THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED -- AND MANY OF OUR MANUFACTURERS CURRENTLY PUBLISH THEM ONLINE AND IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES -- ALSO START BY JUST SAYING THAT OUR INDUSTRY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY I JUST LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH -- IS SIMPLY MEMBER KALRA ON AND I AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FIVE THAT BILL MANDATES THE DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS FOR PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS USED IN SALONS. IT MAKES THE IDENTICAL REQUIREMENTS TO INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY THAT'S CURRENTLY PROVIDED FOR COSMETICS PROVIDED AT RETAIL SALE -- AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN PC PC BELIEVES ON THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR -- SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN IT IS VAGUE ON THE SAFETY DATA SHEETS SHOULD -- ARE INTENDED FOR USE BY WORKPLACE PROFESSIONALS EMERGENCY PERSONNEL POISON CONTROL CENTERS I'M NOT CONSUMERS SO THE LANGUAGE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CLARIFIED -- BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE MANDATED FOR PROFESSIONAL YEARS AND RETAIL SALE CUTS MAX -- THE FORMAT AND THE CONTENT OF THE S. TO GAS IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT'S FOR CONSUMER USE AS FOR OCCUPATIONAL USE. SECONDLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- PROVIDING A SEPARATE SDS SHEET -- FOR EVERY DIFFERENT SHADE AND COLOUR OF PRODUCT -- IN OUR VIEW IS UNNECESSARY SO THE SAFETY DATA PROFILE DOES NOT CHANGE BASED ON A SHADE OR COLOR AND SO YOU COULD HAVE ONE MANUFACTURER WITH ONE PRODUCT WITH ONE SAFETY PROFILE WITH HUNDREDS OF VARIATIONS IN COLOR OR SHADE. AND SO IT'S OUR OPINION THAT WE THINK PROVIDED HAVING TO PRINT -- DUPLICATE AND ASKED YES FOR EVERY DIFFERENT SHADE IS UNNECESSARY I'M AND DOESN'T EVEN PROVIDE ANY ADDED BENEFIT -- TO WORKER SO -- FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO AB SIX FOUR SEVEN ON UNLESS A MAN DEAD -- WE DO APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW OUR MEMBER COMPANIES DO EVERYTHING BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE -- INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY AND ARE PROVIDING PRODUCTS -- TO SALONS AND SPAS AROUND THE COUNTRY SO WE SUPPORT MAKING SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ADEQUATE -- INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE THANK YOU FOR A TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON A COOKING AS A BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION PARTICULARLY. ON THE INCLUSION OF DISINFECTANTS WE HAVE OFFERED LANGUAGE WHERE WE REQUEST TO NARROW THE DEFINITION OF DISINFECTANT SO IT'S AS SPECIFIC TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE LABELED FOR USE ON TOOLS USED IN A SALON -- OUR INDUSTRY IS SORT OF USED TO HAVING REGULATED BY WHAT IS ON LABEL I'M OUR PRODUCTS ARE APPROVED BY THE US EPA AND THEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY -- SO CAN APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ARE ARE HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIVERSE -- IS SPECIFIC TO WHAT IT WOULD BE USED IN SALONS AND NOT SORT OF TRIGGER -- ALL PROFESSIONAL DISINFECTANTS THAT COULD BE USED IN A AND A BROAD -- APPLICATIONS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MR NOW LET'S SEE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE YES MISTER DALI. SO UP PER SE BRING THE BILL FORD AS SOMEBODY WHO. HAS WORKED THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF THE MSTS. LAWS FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS QUITE FRANKLY -- SO I I WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT I AM A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S A PROBLEM TO REPORT IN LANGUAGE THAT TO IT SO THERE'S SOME BROADNESS IN YOUR BILL. NUMBER. ONE HOW MANY LANGUAGES ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I DO I MEAN THAT'S HASN'T REALLY BEEN DEFINED AND I KNOW THAT. VIETNAMESE AND I MEAN WE HAD SEVERAL BILLS IN THE PAST -- AND I WANT TO THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND. THE PRODUCTS THEY USE EVERYDAY NUMBER ONE NUMBER -- TWO AND THEN THE DEFINITION OF COMMERCIAL -- AND THEN ALSO A NON COMMERCIAL SO -- THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I THE FORT OF SUPPORTING A REAL HEALTHY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE. SO WE GET THERE. UNTIL I HAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THANK YOU SUMMER DOLLY ABSOLUTELY -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL. GOES FORWARD AS INTENDED WAS REALLY JUST PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THOSE THAT ARE WORKING -- BUT WE IN THESE LINES TO THAT -- AND MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION WE ACTUALLY LIVE SPECIFIC LANGUAGES SO IT'S NOT BROAD BASE AND HAVE TO BE TRANSLATED UNDER DIFFERENT LANGUAGES REALLY WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ALL LANGUAGES. THAT ARE MOST PREDOMINANT -- BUT IN THE INDUSTRY ENGLISH OBVIOUSLY IS ALREADY THERE ARE BEING DONE SPANISH VIETNAMESE CHINESE AND KOREAN. AND SO -- BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DON'T SPECIFY THAT IS GOOD IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE OVERLY BURDENSOME ON INDUSTRY AND AS A INDICATOR EARLIER -- AND ACTUALLY EVEN INDICATE ABOUT OPPOSITION -- NOT ONLY OF THESE ISSUES ALREADY BEING CREATED BUT MANY THE COMPANY'S ALREADY PUBLISHING THEM ONLINE AND SOME ARE TRANSLATING AS WELL. AND SO THE BUT IT'S NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL TRANSLATION WHICH PRESUMABLY WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE ONE TIME OR MAYBE TOUCHED UP ON OCCASION TO UPDATE IT -- BUT IT AND IT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE THAT ARE WORKING IN THE SALONS NOT BIRD YOU YOU AND I THAT WALK IN AND AND AND AND BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS. GEARED TOWARDS THOSE ARE THE PROFESSIONALS THAT DEAL WITH THESE PRODUCTS EVERY DAY AND SO THE IDEA REALLY IS THAT WORKER SAFETY AND I THINK THAT. BY THAT SALON WORKER HAVING GREATER INFORMATION OF COURSE THAT CREATES A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BOB BECAUSE THEY ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE USING. HAND UP ALSO TO THE FOR THE COMMENT MY POSITION ON THE DISINFECTANTS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY THAT AS WELL AND THEN ALSO ON THE COLOR LIKE IT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THERE'S TO NEVER COLORS I MEAN. THEY WITH THIS THE JANICE IS OF THE CHEMICALS PROBABLY CLOSE THE SAME I'M ASSUMING THAT ON OF THAT CREDIT OR GIVE. KATHY MITCHELL YEAH I THINK THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE BILL THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY. IT. HOW THE BILL READS -- AND MAYBE WE SHOULD CLARIFY THIS IS IF THERE ARE SEPARATE SAFETY DEED DATA SHEETS CREATED. FOUR DIFFERENT COLORS THAN THOSE ALSO HAVE TO BE PUT ON A WEBSITE. SO AGAIN DOES NOT CREATE. ANY NEW OBLIGATION -- TO TO DEVELOP SAFETY DATA SHEETS IT DOES REQUIRE THEM TO CREATE SEPARATE DATA SHEETS IT DOES IT IS SHE'S ALREADY BY LOBBYING CREATED. THAT REQUIRES AN OPOSSUM SEPARATELY SO IT'S EASIER TO FOLLOW. AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY THAT AS WELL AS WITH YOUR OFFICE ANYONE ELSE WELL I'M READING I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL RIGHT HERE. THE LANGUAGE IT SAYS BIT SO SEPARATE MSTS BASED ON COLOR OR TENT. AS IN NAIL POLISHES HAIR DYE AND OTHER COSMETICS SO THEY MUST ALREADY HAVE AN MSTS READY IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING JUST ITEM TRANSLATE INTO THEM FOR LUNCH OKAY. FINE WHICH HELP CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IT IS A IT CAN BE. A LITTLE CONFUSING IF IF UP READ -- AND SO IF THERE'S A OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY IT FOR THEIR HAPPY TO DO THAT. A MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT TO THE BILL IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- MISTER KALRA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND ALSO TO RESPOND TO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. NO I I I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S WORKING WITH US AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS OR RAISE I THINK THAT MY RESPONSES -- I HOPE ADEQUATELY ANSWER THEM BUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AS WELL AS ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS RESPECTFULLY ASK. OKAY AND THEN YOU ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THIS IS FOR COMMERCIAL. NOT FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER WHO HAS MUCH LESS OF AN EXPOSURE. THAT IS CORRECT ALL RIGHT -- MADAM SECRETARY YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB SIX FORTY SEVEN KALRA THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. KALRA [inaudible] CALLER I BAUER-KAHAN DALY [inaudible] DALY AYE [inaudible] CRISTINA GARCIA [inaudible] HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE MATHIS. MATH IS NOT VOTING RIGHTS TO CHANGE. HERE SINCE FOR VOTE YOU HAVE MORE. WE'LL GET ONE MORE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU PLEASE COME FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB. SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THIS IS COMMITTEE THAT KNOWS FULL WELL HOW UNACCEPTABLE IT IS THAT IN THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN WE STILL HAVE TOO MANY COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE AND OVER A MILLION RESIDENTS WHO LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER. THIS IS A BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT IN MANY YEARS OF THE STATE THERE ARE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE PROVISION OF SAFE DRINKING WATER. THAT HAVE A DEFICIENCY IN TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL OR FINANCIAL CAPACITY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WERE CONTAMINATED DRINKING. THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OFTEN NEAR OR NEXT TO LARGER WATER SYSTEMS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE HE KNEW WATER DISTRICT. WHILE THE CONSOLIDATION OF WATER SYSTEMS CAN ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS IN NEIGHBORING AREAS RECEIVE CLEAN WATER. FOR WATER SYSTEMS REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE APPROVAL PROCESS CAN BE UNDULY TIME CONSUMING IN SOME INSTANCES APPROVAL CAN TAKE AS LONG AS SIXTEEN MONTHS EVEN AFTER. A STRONG MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS VOTE TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR SYSTEM WITH A NEIGHBORING UTILITY. IT'S A CPU SEES OBLIGATION TO REVIEW CONSOLIDATIONS EFFICIENTLY IN ORDER TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LONGER REVIEW TAKES THE LONGER WE HAVE RESIDENTS WERE LEFT WITHOUT. A CLEAN DRINKING WATER WE NEED TO BOTH PROTECT EXISTING REPAIRS AND DELIVER CLEAN WATER TO NEW CUSTOMERS THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES ON THE CPC FOR CONSOLIDATION APPROVAL. TO ENSURE THAT THE CPC CAN HELP IMPLEMENT OUR STATE'S OBJECTIVES OF PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS THAT WERE JACKSON I'M APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA WATER SO SHE SHOULD. I'M ASSOCIATION SECOND VICE PRESIDENT 420-192-2020. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF RATES AND READ THE TERRY AFFAIRS FOR LIBERTY UTILITIES WEST REGION. IN THIS CAPACITY I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATORY APPROVALS ON ALL CONSOLIDATION APPLICATIONS. MADE BY MY COMPANY TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. CURRENTLY LIBERTY UTILITIES HAS TO CONSOLIDATION APPLICATIONS BEFORE THE CPUC ONE WAS FILED IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOLLOWING A COMMISSION DECISION IN JANUARY OF THAT YEAR. DIRECTING A TROUBLED SMALL WATER SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO BE ACQUIRED BY LIBERTY. THE SECOND APPLICATION WAS FILED IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOLLOWING AN ELECTION WHERE MORE THAN 60% OF THE VOTING RESIDENTS OF PARIS CALIFORNIA. ELECTED TO HAVE THE CITY CELLS TROUBLED WATER SYSTEM TO LIBERTY. NEITHER OF THESE PENDING APPLICATIONS ARE ANYWHERE NEAR COMPLETION. IN ADDITION LIBERTY UTILITIES AT THE REQUEST OF BOTH THE CPUC IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. ACQUIRED THE URINAL WATER COMPANY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A WATER SYSTEM NEAR BARSTOW THAT HAD BEEN ABANDONED WAS IN RECEIVERSHIP. AND HAD FAILED AS A COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT. ALSO LIBERTIES CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY SOLICITATION PROCESS FOR THE RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE THE CITY OF A WATER DISTRICT. WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONSOLIDATION LEGISLATION A. B. FIFTEEN SEVEN SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT BROUGHT THAT TROUBLED SYSTEM UNDER THE TEMPORARY CONTROL THE COUNTY. CW A VERY MUCH APPRECIATES THE EFFORTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND TAKING ON THIS BILL. AS YOU JUST NOTED THE APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE CPC CAN BE UNDULY TIME CONSUMING. AND A BALANCE IS NEEDED BETWEEN THE CPC'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROPRIATE REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATION APPLICATIONS. AND THE CUSTOMER'S NEED FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. IN PART THE DELAYS ARE STRUCTURAL NATURE BECAUSE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AT THE CPC BEGINS WITH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH TIMELINE FOR DETAILED LEGAL PROCEEDING. USUALLY THE WATER UTILITIES APPLICATION IS COMPLETE. BUT OFTEN THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WHICH PROCESSES THE APPLICATION FOR THE CPC. REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DATA AND INFORMATION PRINCIPALLY FOR TWO REASONS. CONCERNS OVER PURCHASE PRICE. AND CONCERNS OVER POTENTIAL RATE IMPACTS ON THE UTILITIES EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THIS ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS CAN TAKE MONTHS TO COMPLETE. CONSTRAINTS THE COMMISSION RESOURCES THAT IMPEDE FASTER APPROVAL TIMES. INCLUDE THE VOLUME OF ENERGY RELATED WORK. THE SUBORDINATION OF WATER ISSUES TO ENERGY ISSUES. AND THE JOURNAL WORKLOAD ON CPC ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CAM CONTRIBUTING TO DELAYS MAY INCLUDE THE APPLICATION MAY BE INCOMPLETE. THE COMMISSION MAY INSIST ON REVISED VALUATION OUR APPRAISAL OF THE SYSTEM BEING ACQUIRED. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND ASSIGN COMMISSIONERS MAY BE CHANGED IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROCEEDING. THERE MAY BE DISPUTES OVER THE VALUE OF WATER RIGHTS HELD BY THE SYSTEM BEING ACQUIRED. PLUS MANY OTHER PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES MAY ARISE. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BY CHANGING THE STARTING POINT FOR AN APPLICATION FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO EIGHT MONTHS. IF YOU BEGIN WITH EIGHT MONTHS ALL STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE INCENTIVIZE TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS. THE COMMISSION WILL STILL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE. JUST AS THEY DO NOW IF INTRACTABLE ISSUES EMERGE BUT AT LEAST THAT EXTENSION WILL BE TEN MONTHS SOONER THAN IT IS NOW. ADDITIONALLY CONSOLIDATION APPLICATION TEMPLATE CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR ALL UTILITIES SEE USE THAT WOULD INCORPORATE RESPONSES TO A STANDARD SET OF DATA REQUESTS. CONSOLIDATIONS DRAGGING ON BEYOND EIGHTEEN MONTHS ARE UNACCEPTABLE IN THE CURRENT WATER WORLD. WHERE THE STATE HAS AN AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION POLICY? WERE WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED AND SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE IN CHRONIC NON COMPLIANCE OR JUST REPAIR. AND WE'RE CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR SUB STANDARD DRINKING WATER UTILITY SERVICE. FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION URGES AN AYE VOTE ON AB. SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU BOB. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. JENNIFER COMPUTER THOUGH ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA AMERICAN WATER COMPANY IN SUPPORT ALSO REGISTERING SUPPORT FOR THE CITY OF PARIS AND THE CITY OF BELLFLOWER. MORE IN COMMON THE ATMOSPHERE CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. RIGHT. ANY IN OPPOSITION. OF MR HOLDEN AS CHAIR OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE AND AS A MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE. WE ALL KNOW. HOW? STRESSED. THE P. YOU SEE IS IN TERMS OF ITS OBLIGATIONS PURCHASES RESOURCES. ARM. DO YOU WISH TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. YOU KNOW I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL -- I JUST GOT BACK IN THE ROOM SO IF I MISSED SOMETHING IN THE YOUR PRESENTATION -- BUT I WOULD CONCUR THAT THE PC IS FINDING ITSELF -- AT A PLACE WHERE. ARE WE ARE. LOOKING AT WAYS TO THEIR MODERNIZE IT'D MAKE IT MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OF THE COMMUNITIES IN RING ABLE TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY SO -- IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IN TERMS OF GETTING SOME DIRECTION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY -- COMING TO GRIPS WITH HOW WE CAN BETTER ADDRESS REGULATORY SIDE OF THE EQUATION SO. WE ARE. VERY HOPEFUL THE SCENES AND THINGS HAPPEN THAT WILL MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE NIMBLE BUT AS WE STAND NOW. IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING. THANK YOU. A MISTER DALI. SO I'M LOOKING AT THE THE DEFINED DEFINITION OF A SMALL WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS. PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS TWENTY FIVE OR FEWER CONNECTIONS SERVING OVER SIXTY DAYS SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS. I I COMMENDED FOR BRING THIS BEFORE I THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN MANY AREAS. TO COMBINED DRIVE THE COST DOWN MAYBE GIVE A BETTER SERVICE AND ACTUALLY CLEAN UP WATER -- BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL EXACTLY HOW WHOSE GET SO THE PC IS GOING TO FORCE THEM. TO COME CAN CONSOLIDATE. NO THIS IS NOT AT ALL ABOUT FORCING ANYONE TO CONSOLIDATE THAT THE SCENARIO WE'RE DISCUSSING IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FAILING. AND THEY WANT TO COMBINE WITH TYPICALLY A LARGER SYSTEM OR ANOTHER SMALL SYSTEM TO PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO RESIDENTS AND SO THEY APPLY FOR APPLICATION. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME FRAMES FOR THE APPROVALS TO HAPPEN STRETCH PRETTY DRAMATICALLY AS WERE TRYING TO SHORTEN THAT ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY THAT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THE TICKET TO THE CHAIR OF YOU AND SEE INTO THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE -- WE ARE PROPOSING A FLEXIBLE DEADLINE AND USUALLY THOSE TWO WORDS DON'T GO TOGETHER BUT OUR STRONG HOPE IS THAT -- FOR THE APPROVAL OR DENIAL APPLICATIONS AT THAT TAKES EIGHT MONTHS FOR THE APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF AN ADVICE CENTER THE TEXT FOR MONTHS. BUT IF THOSE TIME FRAMES DON'T WORK THE P. C.'S JUDICIAL PROCESS DOES ALLOW FOR TIME EXTENSIONS. ARE AND IT ALLOWS OF THE PC NEEDS MORE TIME TO PROCESS THE REQUEST ADDITIONAL TIME CAN BE GRANTED SO IT'S NOT A HARD AND FAST RULE AND I THINK OF A REP TO THE SMALL WATER UTILITIES THEY WOULD WANT A HARD DEADLINE AND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO. IS REALLY BALANCE -- WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE THE REALITY OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH THE NEED TO REALLY MOVE THIS FOR WHILE FOLKS ARE NOT -- ARE NOT DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE DRINKING WATER SO WE TRY TO BALANCE IT BUT YOUR POINT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE REALLY COMES IN ONE SMALL UTILITIES UNDERSTAND LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WE NEED TO CONSULT. RIGHT TO THE I GUESS MY QUESTION YEAH BY THE WAY THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY. CHANGE THE CONSOLIDATION AT ALL IT'S TELLING THE P. YOU SEE. OUR TO HURRY UP BUT IT'S NOT CHANGING THE METHOD AT ALL THAT I HAVE THAT RIGHT. OKAY THEY'RE BOTH WANTING IT TO HAPPEN BUT THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT GETTING IT DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S RIGHT [inaudible] YEP. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NO. ALL RIGHT -- SEE WE HAVE A MOTION YET NOW ALL RIGHT A MOTION. CURRENT FIRST BY HOLDEN SECOND BY -- MISSED CRISTINA GARCIA. ALL RIGHT -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE CHIU THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY QUIRK HI QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ [inaudible] KALRA. COLOR AYE. BAUER-KAHAN. DELHI. DELHI I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING WHAT IT TOO CHEAP. PRIVATE. FIVE VOTES YOU'RE OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE HAVE A COUPLE [inaudible] MR HOLDEN ALL RIGHT SO IF MR BLOOM COULD TO JOIN US I WOULD LIKE TO DO HIS BILL NEXT FOLLOWED BY MISTER MURATSUCHI [inaudible] MR HOLDEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FIFTY FIVE ESTABLISHES THE STORMWATER PERMIT COMPLIANCE FUND. WITHIN THE STATE TREASURY. THIS BILL ALSO INCREASES THE CALIFORNIA FOX TIRE FEE BY A DOLLAR FIFTY TO RAISE. REVENUE TO FUND PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS FOR MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM PERMIT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE TIRE FEE WILL DROP FROM THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER TIRE TO TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS. THE COMPETITIVE GRANT OFFERED BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WOULD GO TOWARDS LIMITING ZINC POLLUTANTS IN WATER. WHICH ARE CAUSED BY TIRE WEAR AND OTHER SOURCES. I PLAN ON CONTINUING TO WORK ON TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WITH THE WATER BOARD'S CAL RECYCLE IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX. AND FEE THAT CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS THE TIRE BE POOR CAL RECYCLE AND A. R. B.. STORM WATER RUNOFF AND POLLUTION ARE COMMON CAUSES OF THE HIGH COSTS OF WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AS SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO TEST FOR AND TREAT POLLUTANTS. I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND WEIGH THEM WITH THE REALITIES CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONFRONTED WITH. I LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLORING WAYS WE CAN MAKE THIS APPROACH BIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE M. S. FOR PERMITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO INVEST BILLIONS AND WATERSHED INFRASTRUCTURE AND STORM WATER CAPTURE. TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY QUALITY OF WATER BILLIONS THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO ADDRESS STORM WATER FUNDING FOR LA COUNTY AND MAKES GRANTS AVAILABLE TO MISS APOLOGIES ACROSS THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY IS PAUL HITLER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS FOR THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PAUL HUBER TODAY REPRESENTING THE THIRTY CITIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. AS THE SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN FIVE FIVE AS ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN AS STATED A. B. SEVEN FIVE FIVE WOULD INCREASE THE CALIFORNIA TIRE FEE. BY MODEST DOLLAR FIFTY PER TIRE OR ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY PER YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE MOTORIST. TO HELP CITIES FUND CLEANUP PROJECTS TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE ZINC. ISN'T FOUND IN STORM WATER RUNOFF TIRE WEAR IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF ZINC AND URBAN RUNOFF RESPONSIBLE 440% 280% OF ZINC. IN ROAD SOURCE RUNOFF ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT NEW ZEALAND STUDY. ZINC IS AMONG SEVERAL DOZEN HEAVY METALS AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED HIGH LEVEL WATER QUALITY THREATS FOR IMPAIRED WATER BODIES IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION. AND THROUGHOUT LARGE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. ELEVATED ZINC CONCENTRATIONS IN URBAN RUNOFF MUST BE ADDRESSED TO ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER ACT COMPLIANCE IN MANY CALIFORNIA URBAN AREAS. THE REMOVAL OF CONTAMINANTS INCLUDING SING FROM STORM WATER IS AN URGENT ISSUE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS MENTIONED. FOR EXAMPLE. REMEDIATING SINK IT WILL COST AN ESTIMATED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE I HILL FROM EIGHT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IS THE COST ESTIMATE. AB SEVEN FIVE FIVE OFFERS A MUCH NEEDED FUNDING TOOL TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF REDUCING FOR MEDIATION WHILE THE INDUSTRY AND REGULATORS WORK TOWARD THE LONGER TERM GOAL OF REMOVING. OR REDUCING SINKING TIRES THERE ARE THIRTY MILLION TIRES SOLD ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE PERMIT COMPLIANCE FUND. ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS LEGISLATION WOULD RAISE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WHICH WOULD BE INVESTED IN THE STATE'S COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE SINK IS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS URGES YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FIVE FIVE TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES IMPROVE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THANK YOU VERY GOOD. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WARREN COLEMAN BRP SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. AND IF YOU HAVE AN ON ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. A COULD I HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME UP TO THE TABLE. THE AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAY JEFF SAVERS ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. HOW WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND -- CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS THE OFFICE STAFF AND BUT FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THIS BILL NEARLY DOUBLES THE TIRE TAX CHARGE ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT'S PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE DO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ISSUE WHERE THE THAT PROPONENTS ARE SAYING THAT. THE THE ZINC IN THE STORM WATERS L.. DRAMATICALLY -- PRIMARILY CAUSED BY BY TIRES. THEY COME FROM A LOT OF SOURCES NATURALLY OCCURRING IN A LOT OF COATINGS ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE THAT GALVANIZED METAL ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IF IT WAS AS BIG OF A DEAL WITH TIRES AS THEY SAY THE WHITE IS THE BAY AREA HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THINK OF THEIR SOMEONE RUNOFF. CELL. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO BE STUDY CARRY CYCLES CURRENTLY STUDYING THIS -- AND AND IDENTIFYING SEVERAL SITES WERE ACTUALLY TESTING THIS YEAR THE CITY IS THIS ACTUALLY AN ISSUE. THAT SAID -- WE THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ARE ARE DEALING WITH A GRAPPLING WITH THE M. S. FOR PERMITTING STRUCTURE IS IS OF CONCERN. YEAH ELLE -- THERE ARE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT ARE THREATENING LAWSUITS AND I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY -- WE PROPOSE A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE THAT WE LIKE CONTINUE TO EXPLORING WITH THEM -- BUT UNTIL WE GET TO THAT. WE ARE STILL THIS POSITION OF OPPOSE. I AM I ALSO LIKE TO SAY CAL RECYCLES LOOKING AT TIRES ACTUALLY AS A WAY OF CLEANING UP THIS STORM WATER SYSTEM THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FUNDED A COUPLE OF PROJECTS WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING GROUND TIRES. ALMOST LIKE A SPONGE BEFORE THE WATER GETS IN THE FORMER SYSTEM WHICH TREMENDOUS RESULTS. SELL -- THEY'RE ACTUALLY FIGHTING BETTER RESULTS WITH THAT KEEP WORKING WITH CAL RECYCLE TO HELP FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS. AND I KNOW MY TIME IS UP PLEASE READ RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON JACK MULLIN DONOVAN BEHALF OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCILS OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION AND THE CALIFORNIA TIRE DEALERS ASSOCIATION THE DOLLAR FIFTY TAX IS A REGRESSIVE TAX AND IT FALLS HARDEST. ON LOW INCOME AND WE'RE HARD HARD WORKING FAMILIES -- TIRE DEALERS HAVE COUNTLESS STORIES WERE POTENTIAL CUP CUSTOMERS DELAY THE PURCHASE OF TIRES BECAUSE OF THE COST AND THEY SIMPLY. DRIVE AWAY WITH DANGEROUS BALD TIRES BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE TIRE IT'S NOT ONLY THE TIRE BUT THEIR SALES TAX THERE'S ALSO DISPOSAL FEE. THERE IS A CURRENT FEE OF A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE AND NOW THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR FIFTY PER TIRE. WE RECOGNIZE THE PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT BECAUSE BY THE THE POLLUTANTS THAT ENTERED THE STORM WATER RUNOFF -- BUT WHY ARE WE PICKING ON TIRES ZINC IS IN MANY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AS WAS MENTIONED THERE AN OUTDOOR METAL SURFACES GALVANIZED STEEL. OF WHICH IS COATED WITH LIQUID ZINC. OF EIGHT TO PET FOR CORROSION PROTECTION OF SUCH AS LIGHTS SIGNS BENCHES ROOFS. OF THEY ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE STORM RUNOFF -- WE BELIEVE THAT ANY NEW FEES SHOULD BE SHARED FAIRLY AMONG ALL PRODUCTS THAT CAUSE POLLUTANTS TO ENTER THE THE THE STREAM WATER RUN OFF NOT JUST. PICKING ON TIRES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IS THERE A THORN CAL CHAMBER FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY COLLEGE ALSO COLLEAGUES ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MISS SARAH OUR QUE HAN. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK. OF SINISTER HOLDEN I'M A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND ONE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ICE I NOTICED IN THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALTHOUGH HE'LL THE BAY WAS HERE TODAY -- AND THAT'S NEW TO ME MOST OF THE SPORT IS COMING FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT MOST OF THE IMPACT AND FEES ARE BEING SPENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DO YOU HAVE DATA ON WHERE. THE FEES ARE BEING USED AND HOW. WELL MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME SPECIFICS BUT I KNOW THAT -- WHERE IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE SURE BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE SAME AS FOR PERMITS TO THEN COME UP WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO LOOK? FOR A STORM WATER ARE RECAPTURE AND THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES AND REPORTS DONE THAT DEFINITELY MAKE A A NEXUS LINK BETWEEN TIRE. AND ZINC COULD. FIND ITS WAY INTO THE STORM WATER RUNOFF IT SO IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE POLLUTED WATERS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IT IS A PRIORITY FOR US IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT. BECAUSE CLEARLY IF THE STUDY SAYING THAT ZINC IS COMING FROM TIRES THAT IT'S GOING TO BE. PART OF THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF POLLUTANTS TO BE DEALT WITH WE'RE DEALING WITH IT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING TO WORK VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR AREA -- TO GENERATE REVENUE -- TO HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND SO AS IT RELATES TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT AN IMPACT ISSUE IT'S JUST BECAUSE FOR US TO TO FOCUS ON IT MORE YEAH. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS IN THE BAY AREA IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WHEN WE DO WE'LL PROBABLY FIND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. ON THE I'M NOT ALSO JUST ADD WELL TIRES YOU'RE NOT. THE ONLY ITEM CAUSING SINK POLLUTION. THEY'RE NOT TAXING IT AT A RATE. THAT WOULD PAY THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS THAT IT'S GONNA COST FOR THE CLEANUP -- AT IT'S A SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET. BEN AND I JUST I GUESS I WOULD ALSO HI IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT WHERE. THE UP. POOR FAMILIES WERE OR DRIVING AWAY FROM ON WITH BALL TIRES BECAUSE OF THE COST OF TIRES AND SO THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT. BUYING TIRES. I I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE COSTS OF THE TIRES ARE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING PRICE THAT. THAT THIS FEE IS AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT AS A VERY NOMINAL FEE. AS IT RELATES TO TRY BECAUSE THERE'S AN IMPACT THAT THE TIRES HAVING ON OUR STORM WATER RUNOFF AND SO WE'RE ADDRESSING IT FROM THAT STANDPOINT BUT HI AND I I GO OUT TO LOOK AT THE CAR. THE THE COSTA TURNS INTO THE FEES THESE FEES ARE NOT WHAT'S MAKING THEM -- EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE. YES. MS GARCIA ARE YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL KOSHER GO AHEAD. AND THEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EXISTING LAW SUNSETS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO WHY IT CAN YOU JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS NOW AND WE'RE NOT WAITING UNTIL THE SUN SET AND THEN JUST -- CLOSER TO THE SUNSET DISCUSSING IT IS IT JUST SO WE CAN RAISE THE FEES SIR. THE LOGIC THERE -- AS THE CHAIRS POINTED OUT THIS IS REALLY A A DROP IN THE BUCKET NO PUN INTENDED BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT. THE THE COST OF THE PROJECT ARK EXCESSIVE AND WE DID PASS A MEASURE SO THAT -- LA COUNTY VOTERS HAVE A OPPOSED A ATTACKS ON THEMSELVES TO GENERATE MORE MONEY FOR THESE PROJECTS FOR THESE LIMITS FOR PROJECTS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS ARE JUST SEEN AS A TOOL IN OUR A TOOL. BOX TO HELP US CONTINUE TO GET OUR WAY TO WHERE I THINK WE CAN HAVE AT LEAST. SOME RESOURCE TO HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES SOME WITH POPULATIONS OF UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND AND EXPOSURE -- TO PROJECTS IN RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROJECTS -- IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED MILLION SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND AS MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WILL HELP RELIEVE THE THE IMPACT ON OF THE CONSUMER AND THE THE TAXPAYER IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO VOTE. AB YES AND YOU PROBABLY DO -- TOO I WILL LEAVE THE BUT WE WILL BUT FIRST I HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY CHAIRED THE MEETING WHILE I'M GONE. I MISS GARCIA WOULD YOU BE WILLING. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU THE TIMER. AND V. E. R. [inaudible] RESEARCHER -- WITH -- YOUR INDULGENCES THERE. ARE POSSIBLY TO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU YOU CAN TELL YOUR COMMITTEE CHAIRS I SECOND THE MOTION. CHAIRMAN PARK MY OF MY QUESTIONS MORE FOR YOU BEING THAT I DON'T COME FROM A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND WE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ZINC THAT IS PRESCRIBED AND SUPPLEMENTS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. THAT'S WHAT. ZINC IS ALSO PRESCRIBED AS A SUPPLEMENT IS IS THE SAME -- YANK SAME THING. IT'S PROBABLY ZINC COMPOUND AS OPPOSED TO PURE SAYING THAT IT'S THE SAME MATERIAL. HELLO HI THIS A SUPPLEMENT IS PROBABLY A COMPOUND. RATHER THAN PIERCING. BUT I TAKE IT. ALL RIGHT SO SO WE WANT TO TAX THE CHEMICAL. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE PRINTERS INK IS GOING. TO REACT IN A WAY THAT IS IN COMPOUND DOES NOT [inaudible] THANK. WE HAVE OUR VICE CHAIR YEAH -- WILL WILL GIVE YOU THE I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN IN VOTING PUBLIC SAFETY. THE LAST YEAR. THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY. ITEM FIVE MOTION AND A SECOND -- I'M SORRY MISS GARCIA. THANK YOU -- THIS WHOLE IN ANY BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR MULTIPLE YEARS NOW AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS. BILL AGAIN AND I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT I'VE MADE PREVIOUSLY AND HOPEFULLY BEFORE THIS COMES. ME ON THE FLOOR WILL HAVE AN ANSWER BUT ABOUT THE QUESTION ABOUT A FEE THAT IS SHARED BOTH BY THE CONSUMERS AND THE MANUFACTURE SENATE NOT THIS PUNISHES THE CONSUMERS. AND I HOPE THAT BEFORE I SEE THIS AGAIN THERE'S SOME SORT OF CONCLUSION IN THAT DIRECTION AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS. ONE OF MANY TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALLOUR PROBLEMS. ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS GARCIA -- MR HOLDEN DID YOU MAKE YOUR CLOTHES OR NOW. YES YOU DID OKAY I I'D LIKE IT OKAY AND CONSIDER MY LAST COMMENT TO BE MY CLOTHES OKAY WERE YOU HERE WELCOME TO MAKE A LINK THERE ONE IF YOU'D LIKE WELL I I I WILL SAY THAT -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA IS A QUESTION WE'RE MANUFACTURER TAX COULD ALSO MIGHT ALSO BE LOOKED AT THE THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS THAT THERE'S THAT THAT WOULD BE. CONSIDERED MORE OF A HIDDEN TAX. AND THE TIRE FEE TAXES ONE THAT IS. A VERY CLEAR FOR THE CONSUMER TO SEE AN AND NO -- WHAT? IS BEING THE THE TAXES BEING USED FOR THE FEE IS BEING USED FOR AND HOW IT WOULD BE APPLIED. WHERE'S THE MANUFACTURERS ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FEE. WOULD BE MORE OF A HIDDEN TAX OR HIDDEN FEE. SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF TRANSPARENT. WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BUT IT IS A POSSIBLE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT -- WITH THAT THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND SO WITH THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB SEVEN FIFTY FIVE HOLDEN THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REFERRED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NO [inaudible] KALRA [inaudible] BAUER-KAHAN. DELHI.

MISTER MURATSUCHI WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT AND WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT ON FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH THE AB FOUR NINE FIVE VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR -- FOR WORKING WITH ME AND THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT -- IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF OF THIS BILL AND THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY THIS BILL. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE PRESENTING THIS BILL -- TODAY FOR INFORMATIONAL. PURPOSES BUT THAT WE WILL NOT BE TAKEN A HEARING -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A A LANDMARK A BILL AND AND WITH THE NATIONAL CONSEQUENCES AND SO -- WE ASK THAT -- WE WE APPRECIATE A A THOUGHTFUL. FEDERATION OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED BY A. B. FOUR NINE FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR I HAD CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF MY MEMBERS WHO JUST FELT THEY NEEDED MORE INFORMATION. SO WILL ACCEPT YOUR TESTIMONY AND PUT THE VOTE OVER FOR LATER DAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. END UP BECAUSE THIS IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL ISSUE. WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW INSTEAD OF FOUR MINUTES PER SIDE EIGHT MINUTES PER SIDE SO -- I SEE HAVE LOTS OF WITNESSES THAT SHOULD MAKE THINGS A LITTLE EASIER THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I ALONG WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUFFY WICKS THE JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL IS PRESENTING. THE TOXIC FREE KEMET COSMETICS ACT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT CHILDREN WOMEN AND MEN FROM COSMETIC PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICALS. THIS BILL PROPOSES A BAN ON THE SALE OF COSMETICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CONTAIN TWENTY HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE. CANCER REPRODUCTIVE HARM OR HEART HORMONE DISRUPTION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PRODUCTS THAT WE APPLY ON OUR BODIES ON A DAILY BASIS. FACIAL POWDER CONTAMINATED WITH THIS BEST THIS LIPSTICK CONTAINING LEAD. BABY SHAMPOO WITH FORMALDEHYDE AND OTHERS. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. BIG GREEN CHEMISTRY -- PROGRAM A WE HAVE HAD A HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE ARE. AND AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE THE EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS LAYS OUT WHY THE GREEN KEVIN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE AN ADEQUATE. IN A PROPOSED AND IN ADDRESSING. THESE ISSUES AND IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND SO -- HERE TO TALK -- RATHER THAN MY DOING MORE TALKING I WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER WE HAVE A THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING SEVERAL -- INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS AS WELL AS AN EXPERT ON THE IMPACT OF TOXIC CHEMICALS ESPECIALLY ON LOW INCOME AND LOW INCOME WOMEN OF COLOR. OUTSIDE LIKE TO TURN OVER -- TO FIRST TO SCOTT FABER -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP THEN -- EMILY RUSS -- WITH CALPERS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND CALPERS OUR SPONSORS OF THIS BILL -- AND FOLLOWING THEM I'D LIKE TO ASK DOCTOR ARMIES SO TO THE PROFESSOR AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- TO TESTIFY ON HER RESEARCH AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST FROM MOLLY JENSEN -- FROM THE COSMETICS MANUFACTURING COMPANY -- NAMED BY WILSON'S SO HARD TO YES YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT CURRENT PRACTICE OF OF A COMPANIES JUST PUT LEAD OR ASBESTOS IN THEIR PRODUCT. YOU YOU WERE SAYING THAT WERE YOU I AM SAYING THAT SAID THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN. A COSMETICS WITH THOSE CHEMICALS FOUND -- YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT CURRENT PRACTICE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. WE WE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS BEING SOLD ON ON SHELVES -- YOU DIDN'T DO NOT CONTAIN THOSE TOXIC CHEMICAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO TURN OFF OVER TO SCOTT FABER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I GET MY NAME AGAIN IS SCOTT FABER I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. AND I'M ALSO AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER. LET ME START BY SAYING NO CATEGORY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IS SUBJECT TO LAST OVERSIGHT THAN COSMETICS AND OTHER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COSMETICS COMPANIES CONCLUDE JUST ABOUT ANY CHEMICAL IN JUST ABOUT ANY AMOUNT. IN PRODUCTS WE USE IN OUR HOMES EVERY DAY IN FACT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND NINE COSMETICS COMPANIES HAVE REPORTED USING EIGHTY EIGHT CHEMICALS LINKED TO CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM. IN PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE MORE THAN FORTY COUNTRIES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO BAN OR RESTRICT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CHEMICALS AND CONTAMINANTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. ARE FTA HAS SO FAR ONLY BANNED OR RESTRICTED NINE CHEMICALS OR CONTAMINANTS FOR SAFETY REASONS -- IT'S BEEN MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS SINCE CONGRESS LAST ACTED TO ENACT COSMETICS LEGISLATION AND SINCE THEN. CONGRESS HAS GIVEN THE FDA AND THE EPA THE POWER TO REVIEW AND REGULATE CHEMICALS IN FOOD AND COLORS AND PESTICIDES IN OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS IN CLEANING PRODUCTS. BUT CONGRESS HAS NOT GIVEN THE FDA THE POWER THE SAME POWERS TO RESTRICT DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR CONTAMINANTS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. WE THINK THAT CUT CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER EIGHTY YEARS FOR CONGRESS TO ACT AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK CALIFORNIA. SHOULD JOIN MORE THAN FORTY NATIONS AND MANY OF OUR NATION'S BIGGEST RETAILERS. AND FINALLY BANNED THE WORST OF THE WORST CHEMICALS IN THESE EVERYDAY PRODUCTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU OUR NEXT. MY NAME. MY NAME'S EMILY RASH I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALPERS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP. TOM WERE ANOTHER CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL WE'VE LONG WORKED TO HELP PRODUCE HUMAN EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. AND AN EARLY TWO THOUSAND COMMISSIONS SOME INDEPENDENT LATIN ACCREDITED LABORATORY TO DO TESTING OF THE MAKE UP THAT WE BOUGHT AT CLEARS BOUTIQUES THAT DEPICTED A STORE IN MALLS -- AS WELL AS SOME OTHER STORES AND UNFORTUNATELY FOUND AS BEST AS IN SEVERAL -- PRODUCTS CONTAINING TALC SO I SHADOW SPACE PATRICK CETERA. THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MARKETED -- TO USUALLY TEENS FREQUENT THAT STORE MOST COMMONLY. AND WE ALERT ABOUT THE FDA AND CLEARS IMMEDIATELY UPON FINDING THE RESULTS -- UNFORTUNATELY THE PRODUCTS -- STAYED ON STORE SHELVES. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. I'M AT THE FTA EVENTUALLY DID THEIR OWN TEST RESULTS AND ACTUALLY CAME OUT WITH THEIR TEST RESULTS LAST MONTH CONFIRMING OUR TEST RESULTS AS BEST AS WELL AS IN THE PRODUCTS. I'M BUT NOTED THAT THEY'D ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE CLEARS TO REMOVE THEM FROM STORE SHELVES -- CLEARS DID VOLUNTARILY REMOVE THEM FROM STORE SHELVES A FEW DAYS LATER UNDER PRESSURE -- BUT IT WAS I OPENING FOR ME AT LEAST TO REALIZE THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T. YEAH IT IS UP TO THE COMPANIES TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO KEEP THOSE PRODUCTS ON STORE SHELVES SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHY WE GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL -- I DON'T THINK ANYONE I THINK EVERYONE HERE KNOWS HOW HARMFUL AS BEST AS CAN BE AS BEST AS CAN BE TO HUMAN HEALTH. I'M AND WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH CONTAMINANTS LIKE LEAD AND ASBESTOS AS WELL AS SOME OF THESE OTHER KNOWN TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY ADDED TO PRODUCTS -- ARE TAKEN OUT. I'M. I BROUGHT WITH ME A HANDFUL OF PRODUCTS THAT WE FOUND ON STORE SHELVES. ALL WITHIN FIVE TO ELEVEN DOLLARS -- THAT WOULD MEET AB FOR NINETY FIVE I'M AT LEAST. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE INGREDIENT LIST ON THE LABEL. AND THE I'M SORRY OF MS ROSS IF IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THESE WERE FOUND TO BE A AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES TO APPS I MEAN SOME OF THESE -- TO PRESS CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO WERE FOUND A GROCERY OUTLET -- BOTH OF I THINK FOR FIVE DOLLARS AND SIX DOLLARS. AND THESE ARE PRODUCTS AND UNDER THE WALGREENS FRANCE A WALGREENS RITE AID CVS TARGET ARE AMONG THE COP ON COMPANIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY -- REQUIRING FOR THEIR STORE BRAND PRODUCTS THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY WE WANT TO REFORMULATE THESE PRODUCTS. TO ELIMINATE MANY MORE CHEMICALS ACTUALLY THAT ARE ON OUR LIST IN OUR BILL CITIES ARE BOTH WALGREENS BRANDS -- LOTION AND CLEANSER THAT WOULD MEET AB FOR NINETY FIVE AS WRITTEN. AND THIS IS THAT CANDID -- FOUNDATION -- ME WITHOUT PARABENS THEM THAT WAS -- TEN NINETY NINE MASCHERA AND WE FOUND SEVERAL PRODUCTS FROM REDLINE YOU KNOW AGAIN AT SUCH A CVS AND RITE AID -- THAT -- YOU KNOW ART DON'T USE CARBON BLACK THAT ARE -- MEET THE STANDS OF EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE CAPTION HOUSE BECAUSE I'M WITH THE THE MASCARA WAS EIGHT NINETY NINE AND THE LINER WAS [inaudible] ELEVEN NINETY NINE THANK YOU. I HAVE TO GO PRESENTED. THANK YOU. THE PROFESSOR. HELLO MY NAME IS DOCTOR ARMY SODA AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AT THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY MILKEN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I AM AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY AS WELL AS AN EDUCATOR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC'S WIDESPREAD AN INVOLUNTARY EXPOSURES TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. AND I'M NOT ALONE THERE IS GROWING SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF TOXIC CHEMICALS. THEY CAN LEAD TO A MYRIAD OF HEALTH PROBLEMS EARLY IN LIFE LATER IN LIFE OR EVEN ACROSS GENERATIONS INDEED THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT AS MUCH AS 24% OF GLOBAL DISEASE. IS CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES THAT CAN BE AVERTED I WANT TO NOW TALK INDEFINITELY ABOUT A FEW OF THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE -- PART OF THIS BILL AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR HEALTH THE FAX FOR EXAMPLE LASTLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR FROM MINORITY POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN HIGHER EXPOSURES TO BEAUTY PRODUCT RELATED CHEMICALS WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT THESE EXPOSURES CAN BE LINKED TO SOME OF THE STARK HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND MANY MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS -- ALSO WORK IN. OCCUPATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS HAIR SALONS AND NARAL NAIL SALONS WHERE THEY CAN ALSO BE EXPOSED -- TO SOME OF THESE TOXIC AGENT SO I'LL AND THERE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS. WILL GO QUICKLY. MY NAME IS MOLLY JENSEN I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED BIOSCIENCE WHICH IS THE IT'S A OWNED BY A PARENT COMPANY AMOROUS WHICH HAS ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES I'VE BEEN IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY FIVE PLUS YEARS AND HAVE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES -- I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT NEEDED I'M A FORMULATOR AS WELL. AND BASICALLY THAT THEY'RE VERY ANTIQUATED AND IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING ABOUT. I'M NOT HERE ON BEHALF OF MY CUT MY CUSTOMER BECAUSE MY CUSTOMER OF IS ALREADY OF OF SEARCHING FOR CLEANING PRODUCTS. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT GOES INTO A WALGREENS LOOKING FOR THE THE BLOCKS OF LIP GLOSS OR EYE SHADOW. THAT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT INGREDIENTS AND DOESN'T HAVE THE SAFEGUARD. SO I THINK IT REALLY IS VITAL FOR THE CONSUMER TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO IN AND BUY PRODUCTS AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS THANK YOU. OKAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME IS ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT THESE THINGS GO DOWN THE DRAIN AS WELL.

KEVIN INS CO FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. THEN I'D LIKE THE OPPOSITION TO COME UP AND DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTERS CAN -- ALLOW FOR SOME SPACE AT THE TABLE WELL DOCTOR QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF ES T. M. -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS A J. AND SELLING A VICE PRESIDENT OF COSMETIC PROGRAMS AT THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL. ON BOTH A PHD CHEMIST IN A BOARD CERTIFIED TOXICOLOGIST AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION TO BILL. FOR NINETY FIVE THIS BILL PROPOSES AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON MANY INGREDIENTS EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED BY INDEPENDENT EXPERTS WORLDWIDE AND FOUND SAFE FOR USE IN COSMETICS. THE BAND WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS AND POTENTIALLY COMPROMISE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE SAFE HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS THEY EXPECT. SIMPLY STATED NO OTHER AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD AGREES THAT AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON MANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS IS NEEDED OR JUSTIFIED. MORE SPECIFICALLY PC PC AS OPPOSED TO EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. US FEDERAL LAW GOVERNING COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES THAT COSMETIC PRODUCTS INGREDIENTS MUST BE SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. AND THAT COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO MARKET COSMETICS ARE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SHARING THEIR SAFETY. FEDERAL LAW BOTH PROVIDES ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND SET SEVERE PENALTIES FOR PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS THAT DO NOT MEET THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS. THE LAW DOES ALLOW INSPECTION OF FACILITIES ISSUING A WARNING LETTERS REQUESTING VOLUNTARY RECALLS. AND ISSUING A PRESS RELEASES. AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDERS PRODUCTS SEIZURES UP TO AND INCLUDING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THIS BILL A BILL WOULD BAN WHOLE CLASSES OF PRESERVATIVES HOUSTON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS. THESE PRESERVATIVES ARE WIDELY USED TO HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND FOUND SAFE FOR COSMETICS BY AUTHORITIES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U. S.. HAVING A SUITABLE POWER PRESERVATIVES IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT. IN COSMETIC FORMULATION SCIENCE TO ASSURE THE PRODUCTS MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY OVER TIME. PARTICULARLY DURING STORAGE AND USED BY CONSUMERS. LACK OF PROPER PRESERVATION CAN LEAD TO CONTAMINATION OF PRODUCTS WITH HARMFUL MARKER ORGANISMS. NEXT THE BILL PLACES A BAN ON NATURALLY OCCURRING IMPURITIES THAT ARE FOUND IN EVERYTHING FROM THE AIR WE BREATHE THE FOOD AND WATER WE DRINK. LET FOR EXAMPLE IS NEVER INTENTIONALLY ADDED. IT CAN HOWEVER BE FOUND A TRACE AMOUNTS IN WATER AND SOIL AND THEREFORE MAY ALSO BE FOUND AT EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS AS A TRACE CONTAMINANT IN MANY RAW MATERIALS. MANUFACTURERS AND REGULATORY BODIES AROUND THE WORLD KNOW THIS. AND HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE. IT'S AN IMPURITY IN COSMETICS LIMITS HAVE BEEN SET -- IN THE THE US AND CANADA BRAZIL. THE EUROPEAN UNION EVEN CALIFORNIA'S OWN -- WE HA HAS SET NO SIGNIFICANT RISK LEVELS FOR LEAD AND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE AGREED THAT THE BEST VENUE FOR SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS. AS WITH THE DTS SEE AND STATE. AGENCY SCIENTISTS. THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS LAW WAS ENACTED SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT BE FACED WITH BILLS LIKE. FOUR NINETY FIVE WHICH PUTS THEM IN THE POSITION OF MAKING COMPLEX SCIENCE DECISIONS. IN FACT A BEFORE NINETY FIVE CONTRADICTS SO HE HOUSE OWN EXPERTS. HOUSE OF PROPOSING OUTRIGHT BANS ON SEVERAL CHEMICALS ALREADY ADDRESSED. OR CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY D. TSC. AT A MINIMUM A CALIFORNIA SHOULD LET THE TSC CONTINUE ITS ROLE THAT WAS GIVEN BY THIS LEGISLATURE BEFORE STEPPING IN. AND NTRODUCING ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS. IN SUMMARY THE BILL PROPOSES TO BAN INGREDIENTS THE PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN ASSURING THE SAFETY OF COSMETICS RELIED ON BY CONSUMERS. ADDRESSES SUBSTANCES THAT ARE NOT AND WOULD NOT BE USED AS INGREDIENTS. AN INMATE AWAITS CONFLICTS WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S OWN EXPERTS. FOR ALL THE REASONS ABOVE WE OPPOSE AB. FOR NINETY FIVE AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR VIEWS. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU -- DON CAP KIßM HALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO BE OFFERED TO THE COMMITTEE -- WE DID INTEND FOR NAME TO BE LISTED IN THE NOW SUSPECTED JUST STILL GETTING USED TO THAT PORTAL MECHANISM OUT FOR FORMALLY BEING LISTED SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. I NONE THE LESS THE MTA IS IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION -- TO EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE I HAD KIND OF BUILDING UPON THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS THE RIGHT SPACE FOR LOOKING ATTY INGREDIENTS CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS IN THE LEGISLATURE IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PASS THAT LEGISLATION TO DO EXACTLY THAT WITH CONCERNS OVER MAKING SCIENTIFIC DECISIONS EVALUATING -- KIND OF NEAR THE TRADE OFFS IN THE VARIOUS WEIGHTING FACTORS BETWEEN NOT ONLY THE CHEMICAL IN QUESTION BUT ALSO -- ITS USE IN THAT PRODUCT AND ANY POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES FURTHER THE LAW WAS PASSED IN A WITH THE INTEREST OF KIND OF LOOKING AT A ROBUST -- LIST OF FACTORS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS BETWEEN YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS -- AND A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL A PARTICULAR A SPECIFIED IMPACTS IN IN KIND OF THOSE CATEGORIES I'M IN WITH REGARD TO A BEFORE NINETY FIVE AS WAS MENTIONED IT DOES TAKE ON APPROACH LOOKING OUT BEGINNING. A CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS THAT MAY BE USED IN THESE PRODUCTS A NUMBER OF THEM -- MAY NOT BE BUT NONE THE LESS THE PROGRAM IS SET UP TO EVALUATE THAT LOOK AT THE TRADE OFFS I'M LOOK AT IT. LESSENING EXPOSURE WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE -- BUT ALSO LOOK AT VARIOUS KIND OF THRESHOLD BUT MAYBE SET BY SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT ON BODIES ARE BOTH IN STATE AS WELL AS ON THE NATION AND WORLD LIKE A WE HARDLY OFFICE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. WHICH DOES SETS ARE PRETTY STRINGENT LIMITS WE WOULD ARGUE FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT LIMITS THERE ARE WHEN IT COMES -- TO CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL REGULATION. IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE WORK THAT DTS HE HAS UNDER WAY NOW AND AS YOU MAY BE AWARE THEIR WORK PLAN DOES CURRENTLY ON THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT INCLUDED -- BEAUTY PERSONAL CARE AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS THAT ARE IN SCOPE FOR THEIR REVIEW CURRENTLY IN THIS CURRENT -- PROCESS AND EVEN MORE SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY MOVE MADE THE MOVES AND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO ONE OF THE LISTED CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS IN THE BILL TAL EWING AND NAIL PRODUCTS. SO I THINK IT IS INDICATING INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE PROCESS IS WORKING AND THEY ARE LOOKING OUT. OF THESE TYPES OF INGREDIENT POTENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND ALTERNATIVES IN THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS UNDERSTANDING AND HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS OF THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO THAT. FURTHER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROCESS DOES ALLOW FOR A PETITION PROCESS FOR STAKEHOLDERS A TO REQUEST FOR THE REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS ARE SO THAT ALSO IS ANOTHER MECHANISM ALSO. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THOSE HANDS IN THE DECISION OF SCIENTISTS SO WITH THAT WE DO -- BELIEVE THAT THAT PROCESS IS A MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TYPES OF OUR PRODUCT INGREDIENT CHEMICAL BEYOND DISCUSSIONS -- AND LEAVES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SCIENTISTS TO MAKE THE DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER TO LESSEN EXPOSURE BASED ON KIND OF OTHER. MECHANISMS BY YOU KNOW LIMóN EIGHTEEN ADDING POTENTIAL INGREDIENT IN QUESTION EVALUATING THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN THAT AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES TO AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES. AND THE LIKE SO WITH THAT -- WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. OF OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BAKLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH PC PCNC MTA WERE IN OPPOSITION THANKS. THANK YOU. JULIE MAN ASK ABOUT THEY HAVE THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL OPPOSES WELL. THANK YOU. NO CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION THE HOUSEHOLD COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- IF THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK THEN WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN NO QUESTIONS -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT OF COURSE WERE THIS IS NOT FOR VOTE AT THE MOMENT THIS IS A CLOSING STATEMENT AND YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS COME UP -- IF THEY'D LIKE -- IN CASE THERE IS. SOMETHING YOU WANT TO REFER TO THEM. OKAY WELL -- AGAIN I WOULD INVITE ANY QUESTIONS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPERTISE THAT I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE NOT BEEN. ABLE TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT THAT -- HERE TODAY BUT TO AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY -- TO GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- WHAT WE FEEL -- AND IS A COMPELLING CASE THAT OVER FORTY NATIONS HAVE A READY EITHER BANNED OR RESTRICTED MANY OF THESE CHEMICALS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL LET'S START WITH THE LIST OF CHEMICALS BECAUSE I KNOW OF HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT. THE LIST OF THE THE CHEMICALS I THINK THERE ARE. YOU KNOW SOME CHEMICALS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE OF THE GREE ON THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN ANY -- COSMETICS YES YEAH I THINK WE CAN COULD SEE FOR THAT YEAH THAT FOR LEAD US BEST DOES IN MERCURY FOR SURE THANK YOU SIR AND SO YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW. THAT IN AND OF ITSELF SHOWS THE SHORT COMING WHY THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAS FAILED TO ENSURE THAT AS BEST THIS IS NOT FOUND IN THE TALC OF PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE FOUND OF FINDING. THE CHEMICALS THAT WE CAN AGREE ON BEING SOLD TO OUR OUR YOU KNOW OUR YOUNG GIRLS ARE TEENAGERS ESPECIALLY GAL -- YOUNG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE YOU KNOW. THESE THESE CHEMICALS -- THAT HAPPENED FOUND AND PRODUCTS LIKE CLAIRE'S LIKE JUSTICE AS AS THE YOU KNOW -- THE IDENTIFIED IN IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND AND I I THINK THE IN TERMS OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WHILE WE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- HERE THE ARGUMENT OFTEN THAT -- WITH THAT WE SHOULD LET THE SCIENTISTS THE DETERMINE RATHER THAN LEGISLATORS AYE AYE AYE THING AT AGAIN AS YOUR COMMITTEE AND ALSO IT'S CLEARLY. IDENTIFIES EVER SINCE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE THE PROGRAM HAS ONLY -- IDENTIFIED THREE PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CURRENTLY FILE FINALIZED AND THREE MORE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROGRAM IN THE MEANTIME WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW THESE HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE SOME OF WHICH WE ALL OF US SHOULD BE A DEGREE ON AND OTHERS WE YOU KNOW WE WE CERTAINLY WILL BE. YOU KNOW ARE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS IN TERMS OF OF THE SPECIFIC CHEMICALS THAT -- THAT WE WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SO THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS AND THOSE THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE WE CAN TALK ABOUT LEAVING OFFER. SOME OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE ON THIS LIST WE ARE ALSO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW A A PHASE OUT PERIOD IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT WERE PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS -- BY BY GIVING -- THAT THE INDUSTRY BY GIVING MANUFACTURERS ENOUGH TIME TO TO TRY TO PHASE OUT SOME OF THESE. THESE INGREDIENTS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS AS FAILED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AS FAILED TO ENSURE. THAT THE THE THAT THAT THESE HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL SO YOU KNOW THAT ARE NOT IN A CANNOT. THE ARE NOT TO BE FOUND IN AND PRODUCTS BEING SOLD TO OUR OUR OUR IN THE TWO GIRLS WOMEN AND MEN -- AND AND AND THAT -- THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND SO -- YOU KNOW I I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. AS THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE COMING TO YOUR BILL -- AND I WOULD WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT -- TO IN A AS TO HOW WE CAN -- ALL COME TOGETHER TO TO AGREE ON A PLAN TO PROTECT -- YOU KNOW. WOMEN GIRLS AND AND AND AND MEN THAT THAT THAT -- CONSUME THESE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ON A DAILY BASIS. AND SO -- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. OKAY -- FIRST DIED IN IN -- I'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT. I'VE GOT LEAD IN MY HAIR ON MY LIPS IT'S EVERYWHERE -- BUT WE WERE ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENT TO IT SAYING THAT FOR NATURAL OCCURRING ELEMENTS. THAT IS SO LONG AS IT'S A THE MINIMUS AMOUNT AND I CAN'T SAY WHETHER AND CLAIRE'S WAS TO DIMINISH IN THE MINIMUM OUT OF AS BEST AS TO NOT. BUT GIVEN THE STATE OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY WE CAN DETECT VIRTUALLY ANY CHEMICAL ANYWHERE SO I WOULD LIKE. TO AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THAT WE BRING FORWARD. I WANT TO AGREE WITH -- MISTER MURATSUCHI THAT WE CAN'T DEPEND UPON GREEN CHEMISTRY. NOR DO WE FRANKLY NEED TO FOR LEAD OR ASBESTOS OR MERCURY. THERE OTHER CHEMICALS IN HERE HAVING TALKED WITH THE OPPOSITION I DON'T THINK THERE IS A GOOD CASE FOR BEING MADE FOR PUTTING THEM ON THIS LIST -- AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO WORK WITH BOTH THAT PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS SO THAT COME. JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME -- THAT -- I HAVE A LIST THAT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH AND THAT LIST HAS TO BE ONE WHERE THE CHEMICALS WERE TALKING ABOUT. OUR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE TO VOTE ON NEW SCIENCE I DON'T WANT THEM TO SAY WELL THIS IS IN BAND ANYWHERE BUT WE'RE GOING TO BAN IT. I THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. I DO THINK WHEN THERE'S A CONSENSUS AND I'VE MENTIONED LET US BEST TO SUE MERCURY. THAT WE ARE TO REACH CONSENSUS AND HOW MANY OF THESE ARE. HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT IN FACT A LOT OF THESE THEY DO NO LONGER USE -- NEVER NEVER USED -- WE COULD PROBABLY INCLUDE THOSE THERE OTHERS THAT ARE WILL PROBABLY STRIKE FROM THIS LIST BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT IS. WHAT I DO WANT IS WHEN THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT SOMETHING'S A AN ISSUE THAT IT'S BEEN SEEN BY THE VARIOUS? AUTHORITIES TO BE AN ISSUE THEN WE CAN AGREE ON IT AND IF IT'S IN QUESTION. WE HAVE TO THINK VERY HARD BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION SO I SEE YOU NODDING YES. ARE SO WE WILL WORK CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BE -- ON ALL SIDES FOR BEING OPEN I WILL SAY THAT ONE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES OF THIS SPELL. WAS THAT BECAUSE OUR PROCESS. FOR LETTING AMENDMENTS OUT WAS SO SLOW THIS YEAR AND PROBABLY OTHER YEARS AS WELL. THERE SIMPLY WASN'T TIME TO DO ALL THE WORK THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AND I DO WANT TO SAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE CARRYING THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL BILLS. IF YOU CAN LET US KNOW IN THE FALL THAT YOU'RE DOING THE BILL. AND WE CAN WORK WITH -- THE INDUSTRY AT THE SAME TIME -- THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US ALL SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND WE CAN GET ON TO MISTER MERCY CHEESE NEXT BELL AND THEN TO MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I'M COMING DOWN AGAIN AND GIVING THEM THIS TO THE VICE CHAIR [inaudible] SEVEN SEVEN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. OKAY I'M OKAY WE ARE ITEM SEVEN EIGHTY NINE ONE TWO RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO AB NOT ACTUALLY AND A. B. NINE ONE TWO THE BALLAST WATER. A BILL THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN ECOSYSTEM BY FIGHTING THE INTRODUCTION OF MARINE INVASIVE SPECIES INTO OUR WATERS. INVASIVE SPECIES DISRUPT SHIPPING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL FISHING AND DAMAGES DAMAGES NATIVE HABITATS AND SPECIES. INVASIVE SPECIES ACCOUNT FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN ECONOMIC LOSSES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY ADDITIONAL TIME TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY TO MEET CALIFORNIA STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AT THE SAME TIME THIS BILL WILL GIVE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY. TO ENFORCE FEDERAL STANDARDS WHILE COLLECTING DATA TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THOSE STANDARDS GOING FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER TO SHARE PEMBERTON -- WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. THANK YOU I SHERRY PEMBERTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE TWELVE AND WE'RE ALSO THE SPONSOR OF AB. NINE TWELVE AND IMPLEMENT THE COMMISSION'S MARINE INVASIVE SPECIES PROGRAM THERE ARE. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR DISCHARGE BALLAST WATER THAT WERE ESTABLISHED MANY YEARS AGO AND ARE SCHEDULED TO BE PHASED IN STARTING IN JANUARY. HOWEVER THERE ISN'T TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AND FORTUNATELY FOR REASONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS. SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TIME WHEN THERE MAY BE STANDARDS AVAILABLE ALSO TO POSITION THE STATE. THROUGH THE COMMISSION TO FIGHT FOR THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE WOULD DO THAT BY -- ENFORCING NATIONAL STANDARDS AND CHECKING ENOUGH AND ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S INSTALLED ON VESSELS -- WE HAVE A TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP WITH A BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO INFORM OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE. IT'S A VERY PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT -- PROCESS AND EVERYONE'S WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE SO WE JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR HOW WE ARRIVE AT OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE. AND SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON AB [inaudible] NINE TWELVE THANK YOU OKAY -- SO WE'VE HEARD FROM YOUR EXPERT WITNESS -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. THE NOTION THAT. THERE HAS BEEN -- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I ASKED WHERE I'VE THANK YOU. ALRIGHT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB NINE TWELVE MODES TO CHEAT THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ AYE AYE KALRA BAUER-KAHAN DALY. DALY I'D CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI HOLDEN MATHIS. WHAT'S THE GI IN A TO G.. FIVE TWO ITEM. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE'RE ON TO OUR NEXT BILL -- MISTER BLOOM WITH A V. SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO SOLID WASTE FLUSHABLE PRODUCTS. AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE BATHROOM DRUG. WHAT MADE THIS MY FAVORITE? I JUST MADE ONE BUT I'M THE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WELL. HERE'S THE PROBLEM IN MY HANDS -- THIS IS -- TOILET PAPER THAT HAS BEEN IN THIS JAR FOR APPROXIMATELY A DAY AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S DISSOLVING AND IN LITTLE PIECES. THIS IS A JAR OF IT'S VERY CUTE TUG OF BOOZE KIDS WIPES -- SOLD AT RITE AID AND PUT IN THE JAR OF WATER IT ON FEBRUARY NOW IS THIS MARKS IS FLUSHABLE. YEAH YES OKAY -- AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S IN ONE PIECE. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM -- AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE CLEAR CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CONSUMERS SHOULD PROPERLY DISPOSE OF SINGLE USE WET WIPES PRODUCTS. WITH THE INTENT OF KEEPING NON DISPERSIBLE WIPES OUT OF OUR SEWER SYSTEM. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS THERE'S BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF SINGLE USE WHAT WHITE. PRODUCTS THAT HAVE COME INTO THE RETAIL MARKET. MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO BE DISPOSED OF IN THE TRASH CAN HOWEVER THERE'S A GROWING SUITE OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE MARKETED AS FLUSHABLE OR SEWER AND SEPTIC SAFE. AND CURRENTLY THERE SIMPLY ARE NO FEDERAL STATE DEFINITIONS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A FLUSHABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT IN IT AS A RESULT. ANY COMPANY CAN CALL. ANY PRODUCT FLUSHABLE REGARDLESS OF THE POTENTIAL HARM TO THE SEWER SYSTEM OR WHETHER IT TRULY BREAKS APART LIKE TOILET PAPER ONCE IT IS FLUSHED. WHEN WET WHITE PRODUCTS ARE FLUSHED INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM THEY CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS SEWER COLLECTIONS AND WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS? SINGLE USE WET WIPES ARE HEAVIER THICKER AND HAVE LARGER SURFACE AREAS THAN TOILET PAPER. AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT UNDER WET CONDITIONS WIPES MAINTAIN MOST OF THEIR STRENGTH AS THEIR COMPOSED OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT RETAIN THEIR SHAPE AND STRENGTH. WHITE SO OFTEN DO NOT BREAK DOWN AFTER BEING FLUSHED AND THEY CAN ACCUMULATE WITH FATS OILS AND GREASE AND BECOME LARGE OBSTRUCTIONS IN OUR PIPES. FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THEY WEAVE TOGETHER AND CREATE GIANT RAGS WHICH CAN GET STUCK AND PUMPS COLLECTION SYSTEMS AND MOTORS. AND BECAUSE BACKUPS AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES. THIS PROBLEM IS EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE STATE COUNTRY AND WORLDWIDE AS DISPOSABLE WET WHITE PRODUCTS BECOME MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. UP AND DOWN THE STATE TREATMENT PLANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- ARE THE THESE TREATMENT PLANTS ARE WAY TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE SCORCH OF WET WIPES. BEING IMPROPERLY FLUSHED IN SOME CITIES SUCH AS PETALUMA COSTLY SCREENING FACILITIES HAVE FAILED TO STOP THESE IN DISPERSIBLE PRODUCTS FROM FINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WASTE WATER SYSTEM. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT CONDUCTED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND PREVENTATIVE OR CORRECTIVE EITHER THE WORD FOR THIS. D. RAGGING MAINTENANCE CALLS ON ME WHO. CALLS ON AT TEN OF THEIR FIFTEEN REGIONAL PUMP STATIONS THIS COSTUME ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE CITY OF CAMROSE WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT HAS INVESTED A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO UPGRADE ITS WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. THE PUMP SYSTEMS TO MANAGE THE VOLUME OF WIPES PASSING THROUGH THE SYSTEM ON A DAILY BASIS AND IN EACH OF THESE CASES OF COURSE THE COST GETS PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS. THIS BILL PRESCRIBES CLEAR AND CONSISTENT CONSUMER MESSAGING FOR THESE PRODUCTS THAT INDICATES TO CONSUMERS THAT EITHER A WIFE AS FLUSHABLE. OR IT'S NOT. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS WIPES CAN BE LABELED AS FLUSHABLE IF THEY DO NOT CAUSE HARM TO THE SEWER SYSTEM MEANING THAT MANUFACTURERS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR WIVES CAN BREAK DOWN IN THE SEWER SYSTEM. LIKE DRY TOILET PAPER. FOR ALL OTHER WIPES THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE FLUSHED THEY MUST BE MARKED WITH THE DO NOT FLUSH LABEL. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS JESSICA GALLAGHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN QUIRK IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JUST C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AUGER WITH THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCY IS -- HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SINGLE USE WHAT WEIGHT SURVEILLANCE HAVE LEE -- NEW PRODUCT ON THE MARKET AND THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH THE INCREASING POPULARITY -- OF SINGLE USE WET WIPES PRODUCTS AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING. IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WITH RAGGING -- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF INCONSISTENCY IN HOW WIPES PRODUCTS ARE LABELED AND HOW CONSUMERS ARE GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S SAFE TO FLUSH AND WHAT ISN'T. THE RESULT IS AN ONSLAUGHT OF WIPES BEING FLUSHED DOWN THE DRAIN BOTH WHITE THAT ARE LABELED AS FLUSHABLE AND THOSE THAT AREN'T INTENDED TO BE FLASHED AND THEY'RE CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR SEWER SERVICE PROVIDERS. YOU'VE ALL PROBABLY HEARD THE TERM IT'S GROSS FAT BERG AND THESE ARE GIANT OBSTRUCTIONS OF WIPES MIXED WITH OTHER GROSS STUFF LIKE GREECE AND THEY ARE MAJORLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE US SYSTEMS. AND CAN CAUSE SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS A SEWER SPILL OF ANY AMOUNT IS THE PUBLIC AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE -- TO AVOID THEM. LAST YEAR ALONE NEARLY A HUNDRED SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO WIPES BLOCKAGES AND THOSE WERE REPORTED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD BY PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T ACCOUNT. FOR THE OVER FLOWS AND AT PRIVATE RESIDENCES OR BUSINESSES THAT AREN'T SUBJECT TO RECORDING. ONCE WIPES GET FURTHER DOWN IN THE SYSTEMS OF LARGE RAGS COMBINED WITH OTHER DEBRIS GET WRAPPED UP IN HEAVY MECHANICAL FEATURES LIKE PUMPS. AND MOTORS AND SCREENS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE OR REPLACEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES THE CONSTANT REMEDIATION EFFORTS DISRUPT ALL STAGES OF THE TREATMENT PROCESS AND RESULT IN COSTS ON MANY LEVELS FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY RATE PAYERS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MANY WIPES CONTAIN PLASTIC AND DON'T ABIDE. BY ANY -- LABELING CODE OF PRACTICE AND WHEN THOSE ARE FLASH THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LOADINGS OF MICRO PLASTICS AND WASTEWATER EFFLUENT. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT TIME ENERGY AND PUBLIC MONEY BEING SPENT ON MASSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH FLUSHING WIPES. PRETTY MUCH EVERY AGENCY HAS DONE OUT REACH ABOUT WIPES FOR MANY YEARS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN SIMPLY AREN'T EFFECTIVE ENOUGH AND MANAGING THIS PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. ALONE ISN'T SUFFICIENT BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO DONE PARALLEL CUSTOMER OUT REACH ON FAT SOILS INCREASE FOR DECADES AND IT CONTINUES TO ALSO BE A PROBLEM. IN OUR SYSTEMS WE RECENTLY DID SOME POLLING ON THIS ISSUE IN THE BAY AREA AND BY A LARGE MARGIN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT CONSUMERS TRUST THE LABELING ON PACKAGES AND THAT IS THEIR PREFERRED METHOD FOR RECEIVING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPER DISPOSAL OF THESE PRODUCTS. FAR AND ABOVE HEARING ABOUT IT FROM THEIR LOCAL SEWER UTILITY THE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THIS BILL ARE BASED ON SCIENCE AND THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE CONDITIONS IN THE SEWER. ESPECIALLY IN THE SYSTEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S LESS TURBULENCE BECAUSE OF SUCCESSFUL WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THE METRICS WERE DEVELOPED BY AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC WASTE WATER ENTITIES USING A SCIENTIFIC AN EVIDENCE BASED PROCESS WITH FEEDBACK FROM THE NON WOVEN FABRICS INDUSTRY. DO NOT FLUSH LABELING REQUIREMENT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY GUIDELINES THAT MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ALREADY ABIDE BY. IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE CLEAR CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE DISPOSAL OF THESE PRODUCTS. IS A SENSIBLE AND MODERATE APPROACH FOR THESE REASONS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEES I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR IN GREEN WITH THE SANITATION DISTRICTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JOE Là MERRY ON A RETHINK WAYS AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY WERE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN ANTI TUG OF SO THANK YOU. EMILY BARNETT ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL CONTRA COSTA SANITARY DISTRICT AND THE DOUBLE MEANT A SAN RAMON SERVICES DISTRICT ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. PROSECUTORS HERE ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL AND SALAS WASTE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA IN SUPPORT. BONNIE MANY ON THE BEHALF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND SUPPORT. Q. SEALY ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. GENEVIEVE ABIT ON ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. AND ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD -- WITH THE OPPOSITION LIKE TO COME UP TO THE FRONT TABLE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF INTO THE ASSOCIATION OF NON WOVEN FABRIC INDUSTRY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO WE BELIEVE THE BEST SOLUTIONS FOR ADDRESSING WASTE WATER SYSTEM CLOGS REQUIRE THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF DATA DRIVEN WASTE WATER SYSTEM STUDIES. IN THIS IS THE FOUNDATION FOR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE BIG UGLY CLOGS THAT ARE PULLED OUT OF SYSTEMS MANY SUCH PICTURES APPEAR TO INVOLVE WIPES OR RAGGING MATERIAL THERE WIDELY REPORTED. AS FLUSHABLE WIPES HOWEVER AFTER SEVERAL FORENSIC ANALYSES OF MAJOR CLOGS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE U. K. WE KNOW THIS IS MOSTLY THE CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY. THE WASTEWATER COLLECTION STUDIES INDICATE THAT POSSIBLE WIPES ARE NOT THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF CLOGS AND SEWER SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN NEW YORK CITY ADMINISTERED BY AN INDEPENDENT ENGINEERING FIRM AT THE REQUEST OF THE NEW YORK CITY LAW DEPARTMENT. FOUND FLUSHABLE WIPES WERE THE SMALLEST CATEGORY OF MATERIALS COLLECTED AT 2%. THIS SHOWS THAT THE IN THE FLEXIBILITY GUIDELINES GUIDELINES FOR WIPES ACTUALLY WORK AS INTENDED AND THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES ARE NOT THE SOURCE OF THE PRIMARY PROBLEM WHICH IS CONTRARY. TO THE STATED PURPOSE OF AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO JUST AS NEW YORK CITY CONDUCTED A FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF THEIR CLOGS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM STUDY BY WASTE WATER SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES WATER U. K. USE SIMILAR PROTOCOLS AND COLLECTED AND ANALYZED MORE THAN FIFTY CLOGS IN PUMPS SEWER BLOCKAGES AND WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND LET SAMPLES. OVER A PERIOD OF MORE THAN TWO MONTHS UPON COMPLETION RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES ACCOUNTED FOR A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF IDENTIFIABLE MATERIAL LESS THAN 2%. THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM WAS THE FLUSHING OF MATERIALS MEANT TO BE THROWN IN THE TRASH NON FLUSHABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS PAPER TELLS BABY WIPES. FURTHER A FORENSIC ANALYSIS IN PORTLAND MAINE MORAGA CALIFORNIA SOME REALLY SHOWED FLUSHABLE WIPES TO REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF MATERIALS COLLECTED AND IDENTIFIED. EVEN DATA COLLECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW REDUCTION PRO PROGRAM ILLUSTRATES THAT THE INTO FLEXIBILITY STANDARDS ARE WORKING WELL AS THE STATE'S DATA. SHOWS THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES PRODUCTS ARE NOT THE CAUSES OF OVERFLOWS ARE CLOGS. DESPITE MULTIPLE REQUESTS THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE NEVER PRODUCED ANY DATA SHOWING THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES OR THE SOURCES OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS IN THEIR SYSTEMS. THE DATA SCIENCE COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES. FORENSIC ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE IN THE GUIDELINES WORK WHICH IS WHY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE STEADILY INCREASING INDUSTRIES KEY STANDARDS RATHER THAN THE FAULTY STANDARD CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. THE FLEXIBILITY STANDARD IN A. B. SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO IS SO FLAWED THAT TESTING INDICATES TO FAIL ALL FLUSHABLE WIPES ON THE MARKET. AND EVEN SOME DRY TOILET PAPERS. THE BILL STANDARD EFFECTIVELY BANS THE SALE OF FLUSHABLE WIPES A PRODUCT SHOWN IN WASTE WATER SYSTEMS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S OWN DATABASE TO NOT. BE THE CAUSE OF OBSTRUCTIONS WE WOULD ASK THE PROPONENTS WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING A BAND OF WHAT IS NO MORE THAN 2% OF THE MATERIAL FOUND IN SYSTEMS. WITH NO DATA TO SUGGEST -- IT'S BEEN THREE AND A HALF MINUTES DOES YOUR DOES THE OTHER PERSON ONE THIS TIME HE IS HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL OKAY GRASS GOING TO WRAP UP. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO PROPONENTS WHETHER CHOOSING TO BAN CHECK CHOOSING A BAN OF WHAT IS NO MORE THAN 2% OF THE MATERIAL FOUND IN SYSTEMS WITH NO DATA TO SUGGEST IS THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON 98%. OF THE PROBLEM INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE PROMINENT DO NOT FLUSH LABELING OF WHITE. NOT ENGINEERED TO BE FLUSHED AND WE ARE PLEASED TO WORK WITH CASA ON TARGETED CAMPAIGN THAT EMPOWERS ALL CALIFORNIANS TUMORS TO MAKE. BETTER DISPOSAL DISPOSAL SYSTEMS I HAVE WITH ME JIM LEFT DOES THE TECHNICAL EXPERT THAT CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR DON CAP KIßM HALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION THING. THANK YOU. RESEARCHER IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE COOKING HOURS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION JUST WANNA RAISE ONE ADDITIONAL ISSUE ON THE CHANGES IN LABELING FOR DISINFECTANT RIGHTS IN PARTICULAR. THOSE LABEL ANY LABEL CHANGE HAS TO GO THROUGH -- APPROVAL BY THE US EPA AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION SO AT A MINIMUM THERE WE NEED TO BE TIME BUILT IN TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THOSE THAT TO JUST THINKING THANK YOU. KAREN ARE ALSO MAY HAVE THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AT A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH I AND I NDA OR POST THANKS. OKAY JUST DUMB. WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S HIT UPON THE KEY ISSUE. KEY ISSUES THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR WHAT'S FLUSHABLE ONE IS IN INDIA'S INDUSTRY STANDARD AND THE OTHER IS A STANDARD THAT WAS COME UP WITH. THE SANITATION -- PROVIDERS -- AND THERE WAS A MEDIA I WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS WITH THE EXPERTS AND BELIEVE ME THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND THERE ARE A GENUINE ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE AND WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE EXPERTS YOU REALLY DO HERE -- THAT TED YOU KNOW WHEN THEY DID THAT AND IN NEW YORK IT WAS RIGHT AFTER A BIG. OUR WATER EVENT A STORM AND THAT CHANGES THE RESULT AND YOU'RE NOW YOU CAN LISTEN FOR EVER. SO BUT THERE ARE JUST BASICALLY AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ALL CALL IT AND IT INDUSTRY STANDARD. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CONTENTION IS. AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE -- DO WE HAVE MEMBER QUESTIONS [inaudible] NOT SURE -- MADAM VICE CHAIR YOU CAN GO IN FIRST. THANK YOU OKAY [inaudible] SO I I'D NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS TOPIC APPEAR BUTTON THIS IS MY FAVORITE BILL IT MAY BE A FIRST BUT WERE ALIGNED ON THAT. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BILL OF THE DAY -- AND I DON'T KNOW WHO ENDS UP WITH THE JOB OF DOING THE FORENSIC ANALYSIS ON THE CLOCK BUT THEY SHOULD GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THAT. OKAY -- SO. SO I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOUR BILL HERE IN THE IN THE IN THE CHAIR I YOU KNOW HE BRINGS A VERY VALID POINT WHICH IS THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES IN DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT STANDARDS SHOULD BE MET. BUT AS I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOUR BILL AND I THANK YOU SEE. YOU WANT. NON FLUSHABLE WIPES TO BE CLEARLY MARKED THAT THEY'RE NOT FLUSHABLE. AND THERE'S SOME DISORDER SAY DO NOT FLY RIGHT AND THERE'S DISCREPANCY ABOUT. DOES IT SAY THEY ARE FLUSHABLE. OKAY WHICH MAKES SENSE SEP IRA. WHEN A SHOPPING TRIP TODAY? VERY GOOD SO IT'S LIKE SHOW AND TELL OKAY. WE HAVE BASS WIPES THESE SAY DO NOT FLUSH [inaudible] THIS IS. DAY LOGIC RAN AWAY. CALMING MAKEUP REMOVER WIPES. I MEAN KEEP THOSE BE SAY DO NOT FLUSH. WE HAVE. CEDARVILLE GENTLE MAKE UP REMOVING. ONE DO NOT FLUSH. HUGGIES DO NOT FLUSH. WINDEX DO NOT FLUSH. I MAKE UP REMOVER DO NOT FLUSH. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THESE EXISTED. ADULTS WASH CLOUDS DO NOT FLUSH I FOUND EVERY PRODUCT I COULD FIND THAT SOME SORT OF WHITE BROTHERS FOR CLEANING YOUR FACE CLEAN YOUR WINDOWS CLEANING THE COUNTER. I FORGOT TO CLARK'S WIPES BUT THERE'S A DO NOT FLUSH -- TO THEY ALSO YOU DO NOT QUESTION THEY ALL HAD THE SYMBOL ON THERE IN CASE YOU YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ YOU CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. SYMBOL OF THE TOILET EVERYTHING SAYS DO NOT FLY SO I'M NOT. IS THERE SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT SAYS THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A WIPE THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. BECAUSE ALL THESE PRODUCTS I COULD HAVE PURCHASED MORE I JUST YOU KNOW TRYING. TO KEEP MY LIMITS ON MY BUDGET. YEAH I I MEAN FUND IS A WAYS TO GO THERE AND YOU KNOW BUT IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE OTHER THAN THE TUG ABUSE BUT THOSE ARE SUPPOSE THERE'S ARE FLUSHABLE WIPES I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE FLUSH SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR DO NOT FLUSH LABELING TO BE -- REQUIRED -- STATUTORY REQUIREMENT SO THAT INDUSTRY STANDARD -- CALLS. FOR THAT SPECIFIC DO NOT FLUSH MOUNTED MONIKER TO BE INCLUDED ON EACH PACKAGE ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE IN A CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS -- MANNER A ARE ALL CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS AND SO THE THIS THOSE WIPES THAT YOU HAVE MAY BE YEAH -- ABIDING BY THE INDUSTRY STANDARD BUT IT IS A VOLUNTARY STANDARDS SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY WIPES ON THE MARKET THAT HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THEM WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE THAT WHAT IT IS LIKE A LITTLE. WIPES THAT MAYBE ARE IMPORTED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WIPES THAT -- DID JUST ARE AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMERS FOR PURPOSES THAT THAT THEY MAY NOT SEE FIT TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT DISPOSAL ON BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE. DO YOU KNOW THE BRAIN THE BRAND NAME I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH SOMETHING AND OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK A JUDGE DO I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT FACT. SO I THINK YOU CAN GO ON TO YOUR NEXT QUESTION. THERE'S A FACT ESTABLISHED SHE DOESN'T NOW OKAY -- I MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO BADGER HER I'M JUST I'M GENERALLY ASKING A QUESTION BUT WE WILL ME WELL SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW. OKAY YOU CAN GO ON OKAY SO. IF I COULD JUST -- ARTICULATE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT. BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION OURSELVES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM OUT THERE WITH -- THINGS NOT BEING MARKED PROPERLY THE QUESTION OF WHERE WE DISAGREE IS. WHERE THE LINE GETS DRAWN? SO I THINK THERE'S GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE -- OUT THERE THEY'RE AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE USING THEM AND THEY'RE DISPOSING THEM IN WAYS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE DISPOSED OF OKAY END THANK YOU FOR ADDING TO THAT -- I JUST I KNOW THAT. WE HAVE THESE CLOGS I THINK THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT -- IT'S ALL DUE TO THESE FLUSHABLE WIPES AND I DON'T I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN PROVE THAT EVEN GET. GIVEN A FORENSIC ANALYSIS -- THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO JUST FLUSH HIM EVEN THOUGH THEY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT SAYS RIGHT ON THERE DO NOT FLUSH WHICH I CAN'T IMAGINE DOING BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DO IT. SO I'M NOT EVEN I JUST I'M NOT CERTAIN. HOW THIS BILL WOULD STOP THAT BEHAVIOR -- BUT I'M I'M OPEN TO HEARING -- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SOLUTIONS TO THIS SUMMER THE BILL IS INTENDED TO HAVE UNIFORM -- CAUGHT LET A UNIFORM LABELING REQUIREMENT. AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS GOING TO TAKE EFFORT TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT FLUSHING THESE PRODUCTS -- IS IS A PROBLEM. BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE UNIFORMITY IN YOUR STANDARD YOU REALLY -- EAT YOU CAN'T CREDIBLY TELL THE PUBLIC THAT SOMETHING CAN'T BE FLUSHED IF IT'S NOT MARKED IN A WAY THAT THEY THAT THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE. IS THIS I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF THIS IS IT WOULDN'T BE A A BETTER -- SORT OF GRADUAL APPROACH TO FIRST. TRIED TO ESTABLISH WHAT STANDARD IS GOING TO BE USED AND THEN ONCE WE GET PAST THAT POINT THEN TALK ABOUT. THE LABELING WELL I THINK THIS IS A GRADUAL APPROACH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU START WITH ANYTHING BECAUSE OF MORE GRADUAL THANJUST LABELING THINGS -- APPROPRIATE WILL THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS I THINK IT WAS REPEATEDLY STATED -- OF BY THE OPPOSITION THAT -- TO THAT THIS BILL WAS A BAN ON SOMETHING -- I THINK YOU ALL KNOW -- I'VE DONE TAX BILLS I'VE DONE A LOT OF I'VE I'VE BAND A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- AT ONE POINT I HAD A NICKNAME SENATE ALONE. NO IT'S BEEN A BLOOM -- SO I KNOW WHAT ABANDONED THIS IS NOT A BAND THIS IS A LABELING BILL THAT -- ALLOWS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND CONSUMERS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT? THAT SIMPLE. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW MY NAME THIS IS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND SO THERE'S LOTS OF QUESTIONS [inaudible] TWO DOLLARS. SO -- SOME MEMORABLE MY I'M KINDA IN THE SAME MAYBE. CONFUSION OF MY COLLEAGUE -- MISS MELINDA SO WHEN I DO FEAR CONFUSION. WELL SO CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN CAN YOU DETERMINE WHEN YOU CLEAN A CLOG OUT WHETHER IT WAS A NON FLUSHABLE WIFE OR A FLUSHABLE WHITE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU. YEAH NOT THE FOG OKAY YES THERE ARE -- DESPITE WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING THERE ARE -- FIELD STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED THAT -- DEMONSTRATE. SEVERAL IFFERENT TYPES OF FLUSHABLE LABELED WIPES GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND SHOWING UP. AT THE TREATMENT PLANT FULLY INTACT SOME TO DISPERSE -- A LITTLE BIT OTHERS JUST BURST COMPLETELY -- BUT WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT NOT ALL OF THEM MEET THOSE HI PERFORMANCE AND METRICS AND THEY THEY THERE IS A VERY LARGE VERY AUNTS AND HOW THEY PERFORM -- AND THEN ANECDOTALLY YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BE MAKING UP THIS PROBLEM. OUR FOLKS IN. THE SEWER -- SYSTEM -- OPERATIONS DEPARTMENTS -- THE REPORT SEEING THESE FLUSHABLE PRODUCTS COMING THROUGH AND BEING PART OF THE RAGS ALL THE TIME I GOTAN EMAIL FROM. ON THE LONG BEACH TREATMENT PLANT JUST LAST WEEK SH DEMONSTRATING A RAG A CONDO AND EXPLICITLY STATING BY THE WAY A LOT OF THE RAGS THAT YOU SEE IN. THIS MASS OF PRODUCTS ARE THE FLUSHABLE TYPES THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE THAT UP -- AND WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE -- THAT THAT IT THAT IT IS A PROBLEM AND THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT -- THERE'S NOTHING HOLDING THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEIR LABELING THESE PRODUCTS AND YOU CAN LABEL A GOLF BALL AS FLUSHABLE AT THE MOMENT AND THERE'S NOTHING SAYING YOU CAN'T DO THAT -- SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR CONSISTENT LABELLING REQUIREMENTS -- THAT. THE EXPRESSLY STATE THAT -- FLUSHABLE PRODUCT -- CAN BE CALLED FLUSHABLE IF IT ACTUALLY DISBURSES IN THE SYSTEM APPROPRIATELY AND DOESN'T CAUSE DAMAGE. OKAY MY SECOND FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS SO. I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY THE WELL TWO THINGS I THINK IS THE ISSUE IS THE NUMBER. ONE THE THE PUBLIC IS NOT EDUCATED ON I'M ASSUMING A MAJORITY OF FLASH NON FLUSHABLE GET FLASHED NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO MAYBE. SOME OF THE STOP THIS DETERMINE POSSIBLE ISN'T REALLY SUITABLE FOR OUR SYSTEM MAYBE AND I KNOW THAT TOM. MY EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH CS DIS OVER THE YEARS. AND NOW THAT WE'VE CHANGED OUR POLICIES TO LOW FLOW SYSTEMS WE DON'T HAVE THE VOLUME OF WATER TO ACTUALLY. MOVE. THE PRODUCTS THROUGH THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR A HIGHER FLOW OF WATER SO I THINK THAT MAYBE HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED ON HERE WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM OF THE FLUSHABLE SO. IT'S A PROBLEM OF WE JUST ARE REDUCING OUR AMOUNT OF WATER AND BE ABLE TO TAKE THE AFFLUENT. AND DEBRIS AND MOVE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM.THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WIDE LIKE TO MAYBE TOUCH ON THE OTHER THING. THE OTHER THING I THINK THIS. CONCERNING TO ME IN THE BILL IS THAT. REQUIRES VIOLATES RECALL THEIR PRODUCT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF VIOLATION NOTICE OF CALLIE PA AFTER WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES UP TO FIVE HUNDRED A DAY AND ALSO SUBJECT VIOLATORS TO LEGAL ACTIONS AND CIVIL PENALTY. PENALTIES UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. VIOLATION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT'S LOOK AT THE OTHER DAY I WANT TO I WANT TO GET THESE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. I WANT POSSIBLES TO WORK I WANT. TO OUR COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT I THINK THIS. IS -- PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AND I THINK WE HAVE MAINLY A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM OR A PUBLIC NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT. WHAT THE WHAT THEY SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T FLY SO? IT'S REALLY MAKING IT ME HARD TO GET TO A POINT WHERE I CAN. BUY ONE SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I THINK THIS IS MAYBE. NOT QUITE THE RIGHT APPROACH WELL I LET ME SEE IF I CAN HELP A AND M'S GOVERNMENT WANT TO ADD TO THIS BUT THE BILL IS BEING AMENDED -- THE PENALTY LANGUAGE IS THE IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AMENDMENTS HANDED OUT THAT I DID GET A CHANCE TO READ. OKAY THANK YOU THE AG WILL STILL HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER LANGUAGES REMOVED. ALL RIGHT -- NEXT IS MISS GARCIA AND THEN MISTER -- MATHIS COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT FLOW ISSUE THAT YEAH I'M SORRY. FIRST ACTUALLY -- THE LOW FLOWS ISSUE IS -- REALLY INTERESTING LIKE YOU MENTIONED CALIFORNIA HAS -- A LOT OF CONSERVATION AND SO INDEED THE FLOWS ARE MUCH LOWER HERE -- IN RELATION TO WHAT THEY MAY BE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE SOME OF THESE STUDIES. HAVE BEEN DONE -- THAT ACTUALLY IS FAVORABLE TO THE STANDARD THAT WE'RE PROPOSING BECAUSE THE STANDARD THAT WE'RE PROPOSING -- ONE OF THE METHODOLOGIES REQUIRES -- SORT OF A GENTLER TURBULENCE IF YOU WILL WHEN YOU'RE TESTING THE PRODUCT -- AND SO THAT WOULD BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE SEWER SYSTEM WITH LOWER FLOWS AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE LOWER FLOWS CLEARLY THERE'S MORE DEBRIS IT TAKES LONGER FOR IT TO MOVE IN THERE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THE WHITES TO GET CAUGHT AND IN THE PROCESS. SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT WE'VE BECAUSE THIS BY LOW FLOWS NOT SO NECESSARY THE MANUFACTURE SO I THINK WE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO A MAYBE TRY. TO COMPLY WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE OF THERE'S A LOW FLOW THAT'S BECAUSE THE ISSUE AND WHEN YOU HAVE LOW FLOW AT LEAST. AGAIN I ACTUALLY WORKED WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS YOU ARE FACED WITH THIS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FLOW SO IT PILES UP AND THEN WHEN YOU DO GET FLOW IT'S SLUGS THE SYSTEM AND YOU GET THESE CLOCKS. THAT'S NOT THE MANUFACTURER'S FAULT. MAYBE IT'S A CONSEQUENCES OF THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE IN BUT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE THE MANUFACTURES BECAUSE WE'VE. CONCERT AND DONE A GREAT JOB OF CONSERVING WATER WHICH IS THE MAIN PRODUCT THAT MOVED THE AFFLUENT OUT TO THESE PROCESSING PLANTS [inaudible] OKAY. GARCIA YEAH MISTER BLOOM MEET YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM ALL DAY. HA HA THIS IS NOT MY FOR IT BILL BUT I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE FOR THE BILL TO DAVID I'M A LITTLE GRUMPY SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M NOT GONNA. YES MY QUESTION FROM THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW. BUT WE HAD THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE US AND AND IN EUROPE ALSO. IN SO. AND MR QUIRK STARTED OUT BY. WAY NOT WHY WE'RE HERE AND THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHERE YOU'RE AT AND THE APPOINTED TAR. CAN I HAVE A MOMENT TO LET THE OPPOSITION ANSWER ME WHY THEY THINK THAT MAYBE THE SANDERS BEING -- ADOPTED IN EUROPE. AS A BETTER WAY TO GO AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT AND IF YOU EVER DECIDE THAT I'M SORRY IT'S IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND SO ON I'M ALSO HAVING A HARD TIME LISTENING TO EVERYTHING. A GOOD SO I APOLOGIZE AHEAD OF TIME IF YOU ALREADY ANSWERED THIS QUESTION. SO I AM AGAIN THANK YOU -- I'M JIM LOFTIS WHEN I WAS THE FORMER TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF AND I WAS SAID INTO FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. AND DID A LOT OF WORK ON THE FOURTH EDITION OF THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT. THE SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUE I THINK WITH THE I. W. S. OF G. STANDARD WHICH IS THE INTERNATIONAL INTERNATIONAL WASTE WATER. AND ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM MENTION THAT THIS IS IN A BAND EXCEPT THAT THAT -- STANDARD ESSENTIALLY -- FAILS EVERY -- NONWOVEN DISPERSIBLE FLUSHABLE WIPES THAT'S ON THE MARKET IN NORTH AMERICA TODAY -- AND SO THE OTHER STANDARD WHICH IS THE IN THE IT ON A STANDARD WHICH WAS DEVELOPED -- NOT ONLY BY INDUSTRY BUT THIS IS THE FOURTH ADDITION AND WE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING. TO THOSE IN THE WATER SERVICES INDUSTRY OVER THOSE YEARS THIS WORK HAS GONE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT STANDARD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IN THE IT ON A STANDARD -- THE WIPES THAT PASSED THAT STANDARD HAVE NEVER BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE THESE ISSUES. RIGHT WE WE'VE NOT WE'VE ASKED FOR DATA WE'VE ASKED FOR INFORMATION THAT WOULD SAY YES THAT FLUSH WIPE THAT PASSED EITHER GT THREE OR NOW GT. FOUR IT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT ISSUE AND AND WE'VE NOT SEEN THOSE. THE INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE THE THERE'S INTO ANY DONNY DON IS THE EUROPEAN NONWOVENS ASSOCIATION WE'VE WORKING JOINTLY WITH THIS -- WE'VE ENGAGED -- WASTE WATER PROFESSIONALS IN BOTH THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL AS IN IN THE U. S. AND THE THE RESPONSE FROM THE FOLKS IN EUROPE IS. LOOK WEAK WE STANDARDS TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SEPARATE OUT THOSE NON FLUSHABLE MATERIALS WHICH HAVE VERY VERY HIGH WHAT STRENGTH LIKE THE BABY WIPES WHICH WE NOW WE'VE WE DID SOME TESTING WHERE WE TOOK BABY WIPES WE CLOGGED IN EIGHTEEN HORSE POWER PUMP. WITH BABY WIPES WE KNOW THOSE BECAUSE ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN THERE'S THE LOW WHAT STRENGTH WIPES WHICH ARE THE FLUSHABLE WIPES. THE FOLKS IN EUROPE THAT WE SPOKE TO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE AREN'T THE PROBLEMS. THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST OR THE MATERIALS THAT ARE BEING FLASHED THAT SHOULD NEVER BE IN YOUR SYSTEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S THE ISSUE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS EDUCATION THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO. I TAUGHT A COURSE THAT IN THE AND I BROUGHT THIS UP THIS WHOLE PART I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED THE QUESTION. OUR I I WILL ALSO SAY THAT -- THE SPONSORS WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE FOUND. WIPES THAT ARE FLOOD SUPPOSEDLY FLAT WELL I'LL TELL YOU. FLUSHABLE WIPES WIPED OUT MY WHOLE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IN MY HOUSE AND THAT'S YOUR NOW I GATHER A GUARANTEE YOU THAT ANYONE WHO. WHO ENDS UP FIXING THESE PROBLEMS WILL TELL YOU NEVER FLEISCHER FLUSHABLE WHITE? JUST SAY AND ET WOULD YOU. SO THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OBVIOUSLY THE PROPONENTS FEEL THAT. THEY DO HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES YOUR PROBLEM. THE OPPONENTS DO NOT -- I'VE LISTENED TO BOTH SIDES AND JUST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THEY ARE. AND I WILL SAY THIS RIGHT THAT TELLS ME NOT TO FLASH. ANY SORT OF WEAPON ALSO TELLS ME TO ABANDON MY SHERMAN. PAPER PROCESSING FEE RECLINING EVERYDAY ACCORDING TO HIM BUT THE VERY SCARY STORIES. ALL RIGHT MISTER MATHIS HAS A QUESTION [inaudible] SOLD. MY COLLEAGUES MOSTLY YOU KNOW I'M I'M A PARENT WITH THE CHILD WITH DISABILITIES. AND FLUSHABLE WIPES ARE KIND OF A WAY OF LIFE IN THAT COMMUNITY -- THERE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE HAVING TO CLEAN UP YOUR YOUNG CHILD -- WHO DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR BATTLES? ON AND YOU KNOW ALL THE THE BACKS OF THIS BILL I MEAN IT'S IT'S THIS IS A LABELING BILL. ENFORCEABLE LIVES -- CLEARLY MARKED FLUSHABLE THEY'RE SOLD AS FLUSHABLE -- MOST. THEY'RE THEY'RE USUALLY SEPARATE FROM -- REGULAR WIPES IN IN DIFFERENT COSMETIC WIPES LIKE MISSILE AND IS IS IS BROUGHT IN -- BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE. YOU KNOW ME AND MY WIFE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILD. WHO DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL OVER HIS BOWELS BECAUSE OF A SPINA BIFIDA? WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HUGE MASSIVE PILE OF OF REGULAR WIPES? THE COULD COLLECT WHILE WE'RE HAVING TO DO WITH HIS NIGHTLY ROUTINES -- IT AND HE'S LIKE. FOR SO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR ANY AND ADULTS. WHO HAS SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND AND THOSE THINGS? IN OUR AND AND LOOKING AT THE THE BACK AND FORTH IN THE SENATE ALL OF THIS I MEAN THERE'S CLEARLY WAYS WHERE ON THE MANUFACTURINGSIDE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S WAYS THE CAN DO BETTER JOBS ON ON THE WAY THINGS ARE MANUFACTURED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I I THINK. FALL IN THINGS OFF THE SHELF CREE PENALTIES DOING THIS IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY A A STICK VERSES A CARROT -- WHICH I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF SO I'M TRYING TO REALLY. FIGURE OUT WHO IT WITH ALL THE WORK THAT I DEAL IN. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COMMUNITY. HOW THIS IS GONNA AFFECT THEM -- BECAUSE I COULDN'T IMAGINE SOMEBODY TRYING TO GO IN AND AND GET WIVES WITH WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET TO THE STORE. NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THEM THEM NOT BE ON THE SHELVES BECAUSE OF THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION. SO THAT THAT'S JUST A CONCERN I HAVE. A MEASURE YOU'D EMAIL BEEN INSURE US THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT BUT AS A FATHER THAT DEALS WITH THIS ON A DAY TO DAY. I HAVE VERY VERY LARGE CONCERN AND I DON'T THINK THAT POINT AND BROUGHT UP OF HOW OFTEN THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED. FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T REALLY HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE -- LET ME. I TRY TO ANSWER THAT BUT CERTAINLY -- YOU POINT OUT A SENSITIVE ISSUE -- BUT IT'S NOT NEW ISSUE -- YOU KNOW -- OF FOLKS WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN AROUND OF GOV FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL -- ADULTS WHO HAVE NEEDS BABIES WHO HAVE DIAPERS. YOU KNOW THAT NEED TO BE DISPOSED OF SOMEWHERE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A QUESTION OF WHERE ARE WE GOING TO DISPOSE OF THINGS AND FIFTEEN YEARS AGO BEFORE THE THESE PRODUCTS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE WE WERE STILL -- USING PRODUCTS TO CLEAN THINGS UP AND WE WERE DISPOSING OF THEM BUT THEY WEREN'T GOING DOWN THE TOILET OF A FOR THE MOST PART -- THEY WERE GOING ELSEWHERE. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY THE ADJUSTMENT THAT A YOU KNOW IN SOME WAYS WILL -- WILL NEED TO BE MADE BUT AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF PRODUCTS AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY -- THE FLEXIBILITY STANDARD CANNOT BE MET FOR PRODUCTS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO USE -- WITHOUT WERE SIMPLY POINTING OUT HERE THAT. WE ARE AND I THINK AGAIN THIS IS A MATTER OF WHERE YOU PLACE THE STANDARD AND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES HERE -- BETWEEN THE ODDS OF YOU KNOW MY POINT OF VIEW AND THE AND THE OPPOSITION BUT THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE NOT SHOULD EVERYTHING GO IN THE TOILET AND TO BE WASHED INTO THE SEWERS AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS ADVOCATING THAT EVERYTHING GOES INTHE TOILET. I MEAN. WE WE ALL KIND OF GREW UP WITH THAT COMMON SENSE OF IT NOW FASHIONING DOWN THE TOILET THAT DOESN'T NEED TO GET FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET RIGHT AND MOST OF US GREW UP WITH THAT AND MAYBE SOME OF THAT GOES BACK IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND AND PARENTS BEING. PARENTS ACTUALLY TEACHING. THEIR KIDS THESE THINGS. YOU KNOW I I THINK MORE MAYBE. A ENOUGH YOUR BILL SAID OKAY IF IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE LABEL THAT IT'S FLUSHABLE THAN IT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS BUT THE THE NON FLUSHABLE WIFE ON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS IS. THAT'S WHERE GETS. A LOT MORE CONFUSING WITH IT SO OKAY THANK YOU AT THAT ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT THE BILL DOES. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SUIT SHE'S ME SANITATION AGENCIES. ARE THEIR FLUSHABLE WIPES THAT PASSED THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO -- REPORT RELEASED -- JUST LAST WEEK I THINK IT WAS TESTED MOST OF THE WIPES. THERE WERE AVAILABLE -- ON THE MARKET TODAY AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD -- SEVERAL OF THEM DO PASS EASILY AND IT'S TRUE THAT A LOT OF THE WIPES ON THE MARKET IN NORTH AMERICA. DO NOT -- NECESSARILY PASSED THE STANDARD -- BUT WE DO KNOW BASED ON THAT REPORT THAT THEY CAN BE ENGINEERED. THERE ARE WIPES WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET ON THE SHELVES IN JAPAN THAT DISPERSED IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU PUT THEM. INTO THE TOILET AND AND THERE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ANDTURKEY SPAIN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM SO IT CAN BE DONE IT. HASN'T BEEN DONE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY -- FOR THE MOST PART WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND STILL CONTINUING TO BE ENGINEERED BY SOME OF THE BIG COMPANIES. IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARD OKAY SO BEFORE I LOSE MY QUORUM. OUR WOULD YOU MIND CLOSING MR BLOOM AND WILL TRYING TAKE A VOTE WELL WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE HERE I THINK WE COVERED THE TOPIC -- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL IS THE ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES -- THEY'VE IDENTIFIED A REAL PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SO THAT THAT PROBLEM GETS ADDRESSED THANK YOU.
