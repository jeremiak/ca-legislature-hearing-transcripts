MR MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE- BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME FIRST THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. AND NOTE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF AMENDING THE BILL TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES SUGGESTED. SPECIFICALLY CLARIFYING THAT C. PH IS EFFORTS AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES WILL INCLUDE COLLECTING DATA FROM EXISTING REPORTING SYSTEMS. AND SPECIFYING THAT THE STANDARDIZED FORM THAT CD PH WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP ON ITS BILL FOR COUNTIES USE CAN BE IN ELECTRONIC FORM- NOW TO THE BILL. SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE CHILDHOOD DROWNING DATA SYSTEM AS PART OF A THREE YEAR. PILOT PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS IN REDUCING CHILDHOOD DROWNINGS AND NEAR DROWNINGS. IN OUR STATE RECENT DATA FROM THE CDC SHOWS THAT IN CALIFORNIA DROWNING CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH AMONG ONE TO FOUR YEAR OLDS AS WELL AS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. AMONG FIVE TO NINE YEAR OLDS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. SB FOUR FORTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA SWIMMING POOL SAFETY ACT WHICH MANDATED REDUNDANT COMMONSENSE BARRIERS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD. OF CHILDHOOD RESIDENTIAL DROWNINGS DESPITE THE PASSAGE OF SB FOUR FOUR TO DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING HOLISTIC AND STATEWIDE POLICIES POLICY SOLUTIONS REMAINS CHALLENGING. DUE TO AN OVERALL LACK OF QUANTITATIVE DATA ON DROWNINGS POLICYMAKERS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES CONTEND WE BUMP UP AGAINST THIS LACK OF CRUCIAL INFORMATION. WHEN ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD DROWNINGS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA STILL DOES NOT MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE CHILDHOOD DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM. AS A RESULT WHATEVER DATA IS AVAILABLE IS OFTEN INCONSISTENT OR INCOMPLETE. UNDERMINED EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS OF RISK FACTORS AND TRENDS THEREBY LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATE PROPOSED DROWNING PREVENTION STRATEGIES. SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WILL CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM TO AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRACTICES. COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC POLICY SO THAT WE CAN BETTER PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FROM DROWNING. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS THE PILOT PROGRAM CDPH WILL COLLABORATE WITH. FIVE TO TEN COUNTY ENTITIES WHICH COLLECT DATA ON SHOW DROWNINGS NEAR DRY. TO STANDARDIZE THAT DATA AND THEN YOU IT AS THE BASE FOR TWO REPORTS ON PROGRESS. AND FINDINGSTO BE SUBMITTED TO THE APPROPRIATE LET'S SAY POLICY COMMITTEES ONE BY APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THE SECOND BY APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IN THE FINAL YEAR OF THE THREE YEAR PROGRAM BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSULT WITH A PANEL OF EXPERTS ON CHILDHOOD DROWNING PREVENTION AS THE BASIS FOR SUBMITTING A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WILL BETTER INFORM EFFORTS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVIDENCE BASED DROWNING PREVENTION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. MOVING FORWARD THE PROGRAMS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS BILL WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL BLOCK GRANT MONIES. CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO THE FATAL CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM COMMONLY KNOWN AS FIVE CANS WHICH TRACKS REPORTING OF ALL CHILDHOOD FATALITIES WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY VIRTUALLY- DOCTOR PHYLLIS A GRIN.

SO WITH THAT OF DOCTOR EGGMAN. HI THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND CHILDHOOD INJURY PREVENTION RESEARCH HERE AT UCI. MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. EIGHT EIGHT FIFTY FIVE. THE CHILD'S DROWNING IS HORRIFIC. YOUR PRESIDENT I CARED FOR MY FIRST PATIENT WHO FELL INTO A RESIDENTIAL POOL. MY MENTOR FACTOR RECORD LET ME KNOW IN DEL UNCERTAIN TERMS THE PATIENT CARE IS ONLY PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY. ADVOCATING TO PREVENT THE TRAGIC LOSS OF A CHILD FROM A PREVENTABLE BECAUSE WITHOUT MY RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. DROWNING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURY DEATHS AMONG CHILDREN ONE TO FOUR YEARS OF AGE CALIFORNIA. FOR EACH CHILD. IN THAT AGE. FOURTEEN OTHERS SUFFERING NONFATAL DROWNING DEATH TRANSLATES TO NEARLY FIFTY DEATHS PER YEAR IN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NONFATAL INJURIES REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE POOL SAFETY LINE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE A DECREASE IN CHILD DROWNINGS. SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG. WE ARE SEEING THE PROGRESS INCREASE IN THE DEATH RATE AMONG THE HIGH RISK POPULATION. AGAIN WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE THAT WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE CHILD DROWNING DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY FACTORS SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENT RACE ETHNICITY EDUCATION MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS AUTISM. AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS THAT PUT CHILDREN AT RISK FOR DROWNING THIS WILL INFORM AN EVIDENCE BASED BEST PRACTICES CAN INCREMENTALLY IMPROVE OUR POOL SAFETY LOCK. ONE MORE GROUNDING IS JUST ONE TOO MANY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU CARE DR PAM. THANK YOU DR DRE NOW LET'S BRING ON- CHRIS LIVE PALM LEAF WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ALLIANCE OF YMCAS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE- TWO MINUTES AND NINE SECONDS. AFTERNOON AUDIBLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS LOOKED WOBBLY PRESIDENT CEO FROM CALIFORNIA STATE ALLIANCE FORMED CA THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IS FOR THIS MEASURE. WILL PLEASE CO SPONSOR AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL SAVE LIVES. THE YMCAS HAVE A LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO WATER SAFETY AND DROWNING PREVENTION. OR SAFETY AROUND WATER PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR TAKES AN AGE AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO TEACH OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WATER SAFETY AWARENESS AND BASIC WATER IMMERSION SURVIVAL SKILLS BOTH FOR NON SWIMMERS AND EMERGING SWIMMERS. PROGRAM ALSO QUICK CARE PROVIDERS WITH SKILLS TO HELP AUGMENT YOUR CHILD'S SAFETY WE WILL SECURE A WATERSHED PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE STATE WHERE WE ARE ABLE USUALLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S LOCAL AGENCIES AND WITH SOME. WORK FROM FOUR TO PREACH WHICH- IS THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO AREN'T RECEIVING DROWNING PREVENTION PROGRAMS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PROPER PARTNERSHIP ELEMENTS AREN'T THERE WHETHER IT'S- FUNDING LACK OF CAPACITY EXPERTISE- NO ANCHOR ORGANIZATION OR SIMPLY A LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM. SO RATHER THAN TAKING A TARGETED AND STATEWIDE APPROACH PREVENTING CHILDHOOD DROWNING COMMUNITIES ARE. ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY CAN WEAR THEIR ABLE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE COUNTY TRAGIC INCIDENTS EACH YEAR. QUALITY DATA COLLECTION IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY HOW WHERE AND WHICH CHILDREN ARE DROWNING. SO WE CAN BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE WALK TAKE YOU PLANNED BUT INTEGRATES ALL AVAILABLE PARTNERS AND RESOURCES SO WE CAN PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES. AS DOCTOR EGGMAN SOB ONE DROWNING STREET MANY TIMES OF THE ESSENCE. WE NEED DATA AND WE NEED A PLAN. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN FOR THIS MEASURE FORWARD HERE ARE.

OKAY A THIRD TITLE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD I KNOW THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY NEXT ACTUALLY WE HAVE- A HUNDRED AND- TEN DEGREES UNDER A DEGREE. WEATHER AND THERE AREN'T ANY PULLS AROUND F. CHILDREN TO GO TO OUR LOCAL RIVERS. AND YOU KNOW THEY END UP DROWNING IN. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE. ON TOP OF WITH ESPECIALLY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE SO THANK YOU AT AND I'D LOVE TO- WITH YOUR SUPPORT- THE EIGHT EIGHT CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. BUT TO. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WELL FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SAY TO ALL THE PARENTS OUT THERE MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU- IT'S SO TRAGIC WHEN WE SEE ANY. OF OUR CHILDREN- YOU KNOW HOUSE AND AS A TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN TELL YOU DON'T TEACH FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND NOT. GET STORIES LIKE THESE ON OCCASION- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE COMMUNITY POOL AND- AND A LOT OF THE TIMES I JUST WANTTO EXPRESS HOW SOMETIMES PARENTS FEEL. SOMEWHAT ASHAMED AND THERE'S A STIGMA THAT THEY DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS NO MATTER HOW THEY DOING YOU ARE HOW CAREFUL YOU ARE. IT JUST HAPPENED SO I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO AND- I ALSO HAVE ASKED THE AUTHOR IF I CAN. ADD ON AS A QUARTER SO ONCE AGAIN I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SEVEN DOLLARS. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN AS SENATOR NEWMAN I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THIS BILL AS A MOM OF THREE BOYS AND A LITTLE ONE. A SIMILAR. IN AGE TO YOUR YOUR DAUGHTER- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL BILL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AFTER THE THREE YEARS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE POLICIES. THAT WILL- CONTINUE TO BUILD OFF OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED SO THAT WE CAN MAKE- SIGNIFICANT POLICIES ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL CHILDREN. SO THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY SIR EDMUND NEW INJURY THIS FORWARD I THINK OF ALL JOIN IN THE CHORUS AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAID. OFTEN TIMES WHEN THE- WEATHER STARTS GETTING HOT PEOPLE GO OUT AND THAT WHEN THAT WATER STILL COMING DOWN IN OUR RIVERS. FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND IT'S ICE COLD AND PEOPLE GOING IN AND- OFTEN TIMES- TRAGIC. TRAGEDIES HAPPEN- I WOULD LOOK AT THE ACTUAL SCREENING TOOL BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW ABOUT IN MY OWN DISTRICT IS A LOT OF THE TIMES THE KIDS WHO DROWN ARE KIDS OF COLOR SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. EQUITY ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS D. FUNDED A LOT OF OUR POOLS AND- RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE REALLY WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME LIKE THIS REALLY BEEF UP. THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY POOLS WE HAVE SWIM LESSONS FOR KIDS. I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT WE LIVE ON THE DELTA ON THE WATER. AND THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY DON'T HAVE IN THEIR BACKYARD. AND SO PEOPLE GO OUT TO LAKES AND RIVERS AND RESERVOIRS AND RIVERS WHEN IT GETS REALLY COLD. REALLY HOT- AND THEN OFTEN TRAGEDIES. IN HSINCHU PENSIVE SO. THANK YOU FOR THIS I'D LIKE TO ALSO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. AND I THINK IT'S A I THINK. I THINK WE'LL FIND THE- THE DATA. IS FASCINATING ABOUT WHO'S. DROWNING IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THE OKAY. THE OTHER QUESTIONS IN THE NUMBERS. YOU KNOW WHAT US A SENTIMENT I TO- WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- CERTAINLY IS A PEDIATRICIAN I MYSELF HAVE SEEN TOO MANY CASES- AS I THINK BACK A GRIN MENTIONED ONE IS READY TO MANY BUT- CASES- WHERE. TRAGEDIES HAPPEN BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE OF THAT- THESE DROWNINGS- THEY ARE PREVENTABLE IF WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAPPENED. DOES IT'S NOT ABOUT BLAME. ALL RIGHT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- PARENTS ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. BUT IT'S AOUT BEING SURE WE TAKE THE STEPS WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAPPENED AND TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PREVENT A FACTORY PRESET YOUR- PREVIOUS WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE TO- TO REQUIRED THAT- WE PUT IN- THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE WE PUT IN THAT WHETHER IT'S THE- VERY YOUNG THE FENCES OR WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED TO DO TO SO THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE CASE CHILD FALLS INTO A POOL OR OTHER. BODY OF WATER AND THAT THAT THEY MIGHT BE AT RISK OF DROWNING. SO THIS IS ESSENTIAL STEP- TO SURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW DROWNINGS HAPPENED AND THEN WE CAN TAKE THE STEPS TO HELP PREVENT THEM. SO THESE ARE NOT JUST ACCIDENTS- THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT AND- I PREVENT TESE TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES SO. CERTAINLY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AND THANK YOU MR SURE DID AS YOU MENTIONED I AM THE AUTHOR OF THIS BEFORE FOR TWO FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ANYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO WAS HERE THEN YOU WILL PROBABLY RECALL VERY VIVIDLY THE TESTIMONY. OF SOME OF THE ADVOCATES WHO WERE THEMSELVES PARENTS. WHO LOST CHILDREN TO THE DROWNINGS OR NEAR DROWNINGS. AND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR A MORE HEART WRENCHING STORY. HARDLY TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE THES ARE PREVENTABLE ACTIONS- AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US AS POLICY MAKERS DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO PREVENT THOSE ACTIONS TO SMART POLICIES AND THREW THEM THROUGH SMART APPROACHES.

WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE- COMMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED. ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TYLER SHAMUS DIED IN THE BATHROOM OF A SOBER LIVING HOME AFTER HAVING INGESTED FENTANYL. THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WAS TREATED AT A LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM FOR SUSPECTED OVERDOSE AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT AN UPSET STOMACH. AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM TYLER WAS ADMINISTERED TEST FOR OPIOIDS WHICH WERE THOUGHT TO PICK UP ANY SIGN OF SENTINEL UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER TYLER PASSED AWAY THAT THE DOCTOR IN TYLER'S FAMILY WERE INFORMED THE TANDARD TOXICOLOGY SCREEN DOES NOT PICK UP SYNTHETIC FORMS OF FENTANYL. FENTANYL IS A SYNTHETIC OPIOID ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE WERE TWO MILLIGRAMS WHICH IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF TWO GRAINS OF SALT CAN BE FATAL. BUT NO WAS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH LAST YEAR FOR PEOPLE AGES EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE OUTPACING SUICIDES AND EVEN COPE WITH DEATHS. I KNOW CAN BE FOUND IN METHAMPHETAMINE COCAINE HEROIN FAKE. FAKE PILLS OF XANAX OXYCODONE AND MOST RECENTLY A STORY I READ LAST NIGHT PUT OUT BY CNN WAS. THERE NOW MAKING PILLS. FENTANYL PILLS THAT LOOK LIKE TYLENOL. IRAQ IS ACTUALLY LIKE TYLENOL- SO. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. SB SIXTY FOUR IS ABOUT MAKING SURE EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE IN IDENTIFYING OVERDOSES AND ULTIMATELY SAVING SOMEONE'S LIFE. RAPID TESTING PROFESSIONAL CURRENTLY EXIST AND IS BEING USED IN HOSPITALS IN SAN DIEGO WITH MUCH SUCCESS. IN FACT IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THE MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS IN SAN DIEGO INCLUDE FENNEL TESTING ANYTIME A DRUG SCREEN IS ORDERED. THE FINAL EPIDEMIC THREATENING OUR COMMUNITIES AND HARMING OUR CHILDREN HAS EXPLODED AND WE MUST PASS MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION IN THE HOPES OF SAVING MORE LIVES. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS JULIE SHAMUS TYLER'S MOM AND CHARLES IS HERE OSCAR HIS DAD- AND DOCTOR LAB WHO'S THE CURRENT. DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT SCRIPPS MERCY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN SAN DIEGO AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME. TYLER'S PARENTS UP. FOR TESTIMONY PLEASE THANKS SO YOU GOT. THE DELTA SURVIVORS YES CAN START. OKAY WHAT WELCOME AND- SO- AGAIN WILL IT TOTAL FOUR MINUTES TESTIMONY TWO MINUTES FOR YOU TWO MINUTES FOR DOCTOR LEFT IF YOU GO OVER. THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THAT'S LESS TIME FOR DOCTOR LET BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WANNA HEAR FROM YOU SO HELPFUL TRY TO SPEAK. NOT TOO FIRM THAT'S OKAY TAKE YOUR TIME. MANY IS JULIE SAMUS AT SP EIGHT SIX FOUR TYLER'S LAW HIS NAME FOR MY SON. ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY CLIENT AND BRILLIANT SON DIED FROM INGESTING FENTANYL IN THE BATHROOM OF HIS SOBER LIVING. TYLER AND OUR WHOLE FAMILY SAGA STRUGGLED WITH HIS ADDICTION FOR THREE YEARS. THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED HE WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM FOR A SUSPECTED OVERDOSE HE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCIDENTALLY TAKEN TOO MUCH IMODIUM FOR AN UPSET STOMACH. SINCE I WAS WELL AWARE THAT DRUG USERS DON'T OFTEN TELL THE TRUTH I ASK THE TREATING DOCTOR THREE TIMES IF HE HAD BEEN TESTED FOR EVERYTHING INCLUDING FENTANYL. THREE TIMES HE ASSURED ME THAT THEIR TALK SCREEN. TEST FOR OPIOIDS AND IT WOULD PICK UP THE PHONE TO TALK. AFTER TYLER DIED WE FOUND OUT THAT THE DOCTOR WAS MISINFORMED. THE STANDARD TALK SCREEN DOES NOT TEST FOR FENTANYL BECAUSE IT IS A SYNTHETIC OPIOID. HAD WE KNOWN THAT TYLER HAD FENCE ON THEIR SYSTEM WE WOULD HAVE SENT HIM TO DETOX OR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT BOTH. OF WHICH OFFER A HIGHER% LEVEL OF CARE INSTEAD OF BACK TO A SOBER LIVING. TYLER STORY IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A DOCTOR I KNOW WHERE THAT IS SEPARATE FENTANYL SCREENING TEST IS NECESSARY. LAST WEEK I WAS SPEAKING WITH A FRIEND WHO'S AN OB AND HE HAS TO ORDER TALK SCREENS FOR MOTHERS WHO ARE PREGNANT THAT HE SUSPECTS OF USING DRUGS. LIKE THE ER DOCTOR WHO TREATED TYLER HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE STANDARD FIVE PANEL-TALK SCREEN DOES NOT TEST FOR FUNCTIONAL AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO ORDER A SEPARATE FUNCTIONAL SCREEN. SP EIGHT SIX FOUR WILL SAVE LIVES IN SITUATIONS LIKE TYLER'S. AS WELL AS IN THOSE CASES WHERE SOMEONE IS TAKEN TO AN ER BECAUSE OF AN OVERDOSE FROM ONE SUBSTANCE. BUT WHO HAS UNKNOWINGLY CONSUMED FENTON ALL FROM A PLEASANT PRODUCT. SENTINEL IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE. IF WE KNEW HIS DRUG SCREEN WAS POSITIVE FOR FENTANYL TYLER MAY BE ALIVE TODAY. HOW MANY OTHER LIVES COULD BE SAVED. THANK YOU AND PLEASE SUPPORT SB EIGHT SIX FOUR. THANK U. SURAJ MISAMIS. WELL BRING ONTO. ONTO THE LINE- DOCTOR A NEAT LIVE- MODERATOR SHE THERE. I'M ON THE PHONE OKAY ALL RIGHT PLEASE BEGIN YOU HAVE- ALMOST TWO MINUTES. MEMBER CENTER HELP I URGE YOU TO ACT TODAY TO STABILIZE AND MAKE HISTORY. AND SET A NATIONAL STANDARD ON THE TRAGIC BATTLE CRISIS EVERY DAY I TREAT PATIENTS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO FENTANYL MY RELATIONSHIP AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT WHEN I CREATE A YOUNG MAN WHO THOUGHT HE TOOK AS ALEX. WITHOUT CONSCIOUS AND BARELY BREATHING IN A CAR HE WAS THANKFULLY REVIVED WITH NALOXONE AND HE READILY GAVE A URINE SAMPLE I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAD KNOWN THAT I CAN ASSIST THEM BUT DIDN'T. GOTTEN A POSITIVE FINAL TEST LET ME SEE GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION FOR NALOXONE AND THE FOR HIM TO APPROPRIATE TREATMENT THE POSITIVE TEST LET ME JUST. THROW AWAY HIS FACE VANISHED SO THEN ONE IS FRIENDS WHO MAY HAVE BOUGHT THE SAME TALE. BUT NOW IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES. IN AGES EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FIVE MORE THAN KOBE THE NUMBER OF TEENS WHO OVERDOSED AND FELL NOW HAS GONE UP THREEFOLD THE NUMBER OF THE BLACK JEANS OF OVERDOSE AND SIGN BY FULL. CALIFORNIA FEDERAL DEATHS HAVE GONE UP FIVE FOLD IN THE PAST TWO YEARS AND DIEGO OUR MEDICAL EXAMINER'S DEALING WITH TWO AND A HALF DEATH DATE FROM FAST AND ALL. INCREASINGLY HOBBLED AROUND CALIFORNIA INCLUDING FAT NO A PART OF THEIR STANDARD RAPID URINE DRUG FREE THIS BILL WILL PUSH THE REST OF CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS TO DO THE SAME A RAPID URINE DRUG TEST FOR COCAINE AMPHETAMINES OPIATES DERIVED FROM POPPY PLANTS. SUCH AS HEROIN AND MORPHINE THE TRADITIONAL PATH DOES NOT INCLUDE FENTANYL A SYNTHETIC DRUGS AND CAME CLOSE TO AN OLD HOSPITAL NEED TO FIRE PURCHASED A SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND A LITTLE BIT NORWEGIAN HOSPITAL QUICKLY ADAPTED TO INCLUDE COAL THE TESTING WITH A PANDEMIC AND THEY CAN AND SHOULD DO THE SAME WITH THAT NOW BUT NOBODY WILL SOLVE THE CRISIS BUT IT WILL ENGAGE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND SOLUTIONS THAT COULD SAVE SOME LIVES AND I URGE YOU ALL TO UNITE. AND LEADING KIND OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR NATION'S AND SOLUTIONS THE FACT ALSO PLEASE SUPPORT F. B. EIGHT FOUR. CREATED HERE.

THAT UNFORTUNATELY LED TO THE TRAGEDY THAT WE HEARD ABOUT. THAT WE ALSO NEED TO TRY TO DO BETTER TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY. PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL UNFORTUNATELY IT'S MAKING ITS WAY INTO ALL SORTS OF. THINGS RIGHT. SO MANY OF THE VICTIMS OF THAT NOW DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO FAT NOW. AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO PICK THAT UP.

IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR- SUBSTANCE USE- EXPAND- ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES I KNOW MY GOOD FRIEND CENTER ADMINS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THAT.

NEARLY SIX THOUSAND UNITS OF LIFESAVING CORD BLOOD- EVERY YEAR AND THIS BILL EXTENDS THE PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN AS YOU KNOW CORD BLOOD CURES LEUKEMIA. CALIFORNIA'S MOST DIVERSE BLOOD SUPPLY IN THE COUNTRY- BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BIRTHS- AND CORD BLOOD IS A HUNDRED TIMES EASIER TO MATCH THAN BONE MARROW LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN.

AND CALIFORNIA RANKS SECOND IN RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY WHICH MEANS THERE ARE A LOT OF RESIDENTS THAT ARE HARD TO MATCH FOR A TRANSPLANT. UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD IS USED TO TREAT HEART TO MATCH PATIENTS. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE OF NON EUROPEAN OR MULTI RACIAL ETHNICITY- ANCESTRY. PRIOR TO THIS PROGRAM. THE NATIONAL INVENTORY OF CORD BLOOD OF CALIFORNIANS. NOW WE HAVE A GROWING CALIFORNIA INVENTORY AND TWENTY FOUR SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE ADDED ALMOST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS TO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY. SEVENTY SEVEN UNITS HAVE BEEN MATCHED TO PATIENTS AND TRANSPLANTED. AND WE'VE DISTRIBUTED OVER A THOUSAND UNITS FOR RESEARCH. THIS FANTASTIC PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY A TWO DOLLAR FEE ON CERTIFIED BIRTH CERTIFICATE COPIES AND IT'S FREE TO THE FAMILIES THAT DONATE. AND BECAUSE CORD BLOOD CAN BE- STORED INDEFINITELY.

ETCETERA THANK YOU MR TRUE THIS MAY SEEM A LITTLE ODD BUT THIS IS IN FACT SENATOR PORTMAN TINA'S BILL. AND HE'S BEEN CHAMPIONING THIS CAUSE FOR. FOR YEARS SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW BUT- I LOST MY- MY YOUNGER SISTER IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO MULTIPLE MYELOMA. BEFORE SHE WAS ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM. THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM I CAN'T ASSURE YOU DURING THAT. THAT RATHER HORRIBLE PROCESS SAYS HER BODY WAS RAVAGED BY THE DISEASE. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT BLOOD CANCERS IN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS IN THE UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD PROGRAM IN THE- SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES AND ACTUALLY FUTURE. THE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS. FOUR PEOPLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. SUBJECTED TO THAT HORRIBLE DISEASE AND DISEASES LIKE THAT SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR CONTINUING HIS FIGHT. TO EXTEND THIS PROGRAM AND FOR ALL THE BENEFITS IT PROVIDES TO. NOT ONLY THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE BUT- THE RESIDENTS OF. OF THE REST OF THE STATES IN THE UNITED STATES OF THANK YOU SIR. CENTER MONTHS. THANK YOU TO BOTH THE US SENATOR PRINTING ON ROCK I ACTUALLY ONLY RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN THE LAST IF MONTH OR SO BECAUSE I LOOKED INTO IT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME AS ONE- HOW MUCH PEOPLE DN'T KNOW ABOUT IT BUT TO ALSO THAT IT COULD BE COST PROHIBITIVE- FOR SOME WHO WHO WANT TO DO THIS- SO IT'S- IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MORE TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN STATED- THE BENEFITS- IN THE LONG RUN ARE REALLY INVALUABLE SO- I'M GLAD YOU'RE MOVING THIS FORWARD AND THINK. AT THEY WERE DOING MORE TO MAKE ONE THIS INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE BUT ALSO THE COST BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- PROHIBIT SOME INDIVIDUALS FROM EVEN BEING ABLE AT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MANY MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING NINE US ARE FOURTEEN L. I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA FOM THE RIGHT TIME CAME THE LEGISLATURE AND OF COURSE- NOW EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE ALSO THANK YOU- CIROC THIS WELL- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU DOCTOR PEN- AND WHAT TO BUY CALLING FROM SANTA BARBARA I BELIEVE WAS ALLUDING TO IS THERE'S A PRIVATE BANKING. INDUSTRY WHICH AGAIN YOU HAVE TO PAY SOMEBODY TO COME INTO YOUR- DELIVERY ROOM AND HARVEST THE CORD BLOOD AND THEN YOU PAY A YEARLY FEE TO START WITH THIS PROGRAM IS THIS IS A PUBLIC CORD BLOOD PROGRAM SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT SO WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC- AND FRANKLY THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS- OKAY CONSTITUENT WHO WAS THE FIRST CALIFORNIA. CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT IN CALIFORNIA A UCLA FLEW THE TODDLER BACK TO JOHNS HOPKINS TO HAVE THE TRANSPLANT AND IT CURED HIS LEUKEMIA AND THE MOM SHARED THAT STORY WITH ME- WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND I SAID GEE. IF I EVER HAVE ANOTHER CHILD THAT YOU KNOW WILL CONSIDER DONATING HER CORD BLOOD AND SO WHEN. YOU GO. TO DONATE- CORD BLOOD AND THERE WAS NO INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THAT AND SO I CALLED ONE OF THE PRIVATE COMPANIES AND I SAID I'LL JUST DONATE HER BLOOD AND I ACTUALLY MADE THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE HOSPITAL AND TALK TO THE DOCTOR AND GOT IT HARVESTED IN WAS THERE AND THEN I HAD A PACKET ON ICE AND SHIP IT AND I SAID MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO THAT JUST TO GIVE IT AWAY AND SO- THAT'S WAS THE GENESIS OF WHY I DID THIS AND I'VE OFTEN SAID IF. YOU SAVE ONE LIFE THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A LIFETIME BUT THIS PROGRAM IS GONNA SAVE MANY MORE THAN ONE LIFE AND SO WITH THAT I L. AND ONE OTHER THING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW TOO MUCH AGO NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED CORD BLOOD BEING USED TO CURE HIV AND BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CITY OF HOPE TOLD ME ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SCIENCE BEHIND CURING HIV THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR CORD BLOOD- VARIANT THAT HAS NO. GENETIC MARKER FOR THE HIV VACCINE TO PENETRATE THAT SELL AND SO IF YOU CAN HARVEST MORE OF THOSE HIV RESISTANT STEM CELLS YOU CAN CURE HIV IN IT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS A THEORY TWO MONTHS AGO IT IT HAPPENED AND SO THERE ARE MANY MORE APPLICATIONS THAN JUST LEUKEMIA WHICH UNITS OF ITSELF IS LAUDABLE SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALAN SCOTT CENTER WILK IS A. CO AUTHOR ON THIS AS WELL. RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER FOURTEEN. IT'S A MOTION. THE MOVE MY CENTER OF. ZATERDAG MEANT SORRY I WAS THANKS SO THE MOST IS- DEEP A MAN BUT FIRST THE MAN REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ITS OWN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

OKAY I'LL PRESENT RIGHT HERE. I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO THANK YOU. TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ALSO. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. AND ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE INFORMATION. FROM ALL ENTITIES THAT CAN DETAIN FOR INVOLUNTARY HOLDS NOT JUST THOSE THAT WERE ADMITTED- SO PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT MY- BILL PACKAGE TO REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR. OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STEPS. S. B. NINE TWENTY NINE WOULD EXPAND ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE. TO BE REPORTED TO THE STATE REGARDING OUR INVOLUNTARY. TREATMENT SYSTEM UNDER THE LPS ACT. AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON THE STREETS WHAT WHAT WHY CAN'T WE HELP PEOPLE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE'RE REALLY GONNA TRY TO FOCUS ON THIS YEAR IS GETTING BETTER DATA. HEY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE- THAT THAT WE KNOW WE SPEND MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TIE THAT TO OUTCOMES ON PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING TREATED AND BETTER. AND SOMETIMES WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE FALL OUT. OF THE SYSTEM. AND WHAT IS THE DISPOSITION AFTER THEY THEY LEAVE AN INTERACTION SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REPLICATE WHAT WORKS GET RID OF WHAT DOESN'T. AND ACTUALLY TRACK PEOPLE THROUGH A SYSTEM IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY- SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPES OF SERVICES AND OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS ON VARIOUS TYPES OF HOLD. WAITING PERIODS RECEIVING CARE AND OUR DATA ON CURRENT AND FUTURE BED CAPACITY WE DON'T SO OFTEN PEOPLE ARE TAKEN IN. A IN A CRISIS AND OFTENTIMES SPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME IN EMERGENCY ROOM. NEVER ACTUALLY ARE TREATED FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR CRISIS AND SENT BACK ON TO THE STREETS ONLY TO RETURN. TO ANOTHER EMERGENCY ROOM OR JAIL OR SOMEWHERE ELSE- INTO TWENTY THE STATE AUDITOR DID RELEASE. REPORT ON LPS AND LAST DECEMBER OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY. HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE TOPIC WHICH I WAS ABLE TO ATTEND. AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON POINTS OF AGREEMENT. WAS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS WORKING. SO THAT WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER. ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO INVOLUNTARY CARE- AND WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS AND MOVES PEOPLE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF CARE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AFTER THEY'RE STABILIZED- I DO THINK THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE MENTION OF THEIRS AND BUY MORE BILLS BUT THIS IS THAT ONE THAT'S REALLY GOING TO I THINK FOCUS ON. GATHERING THE DATA THAT WE NEED FROM EVERYBODY WHO WAS DETAINED- AND THE DISPOSITION. A LINK TO STAY IN THE E. R. STANDARDIZING DATA REPORTING- THERE IS THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES THAT WERE HAVING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOMS. C. FAN. TO EXPLORE OTHER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE HELPFUL- WHICH THIS COMMITTEE- PROVIDED FOR US TO EAT OTHER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE HELPFUL SO WE CAN REALLY GET. THAT COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE THAT WE NEED- SO THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO COLLECT DATA ON BROAD NUMBERS BUT WE KNOW RUN NUMBERS ARE JUST THEY'RE JUST NUMBERS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY CONTEXT TO THEM THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND- SO THERE'S HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW WE IMPROVE SERVICES. OUTCOMES AND CONTINUE TO FOCUS. ON WHERE OUR SYSTEM LACKS CAPACITY AS WE CONTINUE. TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES AGAIN WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH A LOT OF FOLKS I'VE MET WITH MOST OF- THE MAYORS AROUND THE STATE TO BIG CITY MAYORS THAT ARE PART OF THE COALITION OF CO SPONSORS ON THIS BILL. AND THE REST. OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PACKAGE- THIS IS A TRULY BIPARTISAN ISSUE EVERYBODY AGREES WHAT OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN IT IS NOT WORKING. AS IT SHOULD- AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT CREATES FOR ALL OF US EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR OWN PERSONAL CRISIS AS WE SEE THINGS AS WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN WHY WE CAN'T DO BETTER.

THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN MULTIPLE HEALTH SCIENCE PROFESSIONS COMING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL HEALTH FOR HUMANS. DOMESTIC ANIMALS WILDLIFE PLANTS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT S. B. TEN TWENTY NINE. REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER A FRAMEWORK TO CARRY OUT A ONE HEALTH PROGRAM GOALS AND PRINCIPLES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT SIX MILLION UNDISCOVERED VIRUSES CIRCULATE IN THE ANIMAL POPULATION AT LEAST HALF OF WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO HUMANS THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PREVENTION ESTIMATES THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PEOPLE COME FROM ANIMALS. MOST RECENTLY OF HORSES AND- IN SEVERAL CALIFORNIA. COUNTIES WERE PLAGUED WITH A VIRUS THAT CAUSES RESPIRATORY DISEASE.

OKAY HEY- SENATOR PAIN YOU HAVE THREE BILLS YOU'RE PRESENTING TODAY THE FIRST OF WHICH WOULD BE ITEM NUMBER NINE SP NINE THIRTY NINE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SP NINE THIRTY NINE- WHICH IS- BUILT- TO ADDRESS ACTUALLY THE THREE FORTY B. FEDERAL DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM SO THE THREE FORTY B. FEDERAL DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY CONGRESS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT'S DESIGNED TO SET OF ICE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS LIKE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND- STATE HOSPITALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FULL SPECTRUM OF KERR. FROM ISSUING PRESCRIPTIONS DISPENSING OF DRUGS THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE SAFETY NET BY PROVIDING DRUG DISCOUNTS ENSURE LOWER DRUG COSTS TO PATIENTS. AND PROGRAM FACTORS INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING DRUGS COVERED BY MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. MAY FACTIONS AGREED TO PROVIDE UP FRONT DISCOUNTS THAT ARE COVERED- AND COVERED OUTPATIENT DRUGS TO COVERED ENTITIES LIKE HEALTH CENTERS THAT SERVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. CONGRESS'S INTENT WAS TO FOR THE COVERED ENTITIES TO STRETCH SCARCE FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. ANY SAVINGS FROM THE PROGRAM THAT GENERATES FOR HEALTH CENTERS IS DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE STATUTORILY MANDATED DISCOUNT PRICING WHICH COST TAXPAYERS NOTHING. HEALTH CENTERS ARE REQUIRED TO REINVEST ANY SAVINGS FROM THE DISCOUNT DRUGS INTO EXPANDING ACCESS TO NECESSARY AND CRUCIAL MEDICAL ENABLING SERVICES SUCH AS PATIENT NAVIGATION TRANSPORTATION EXPANDING CLINICS OUR OPERATIONS HIRING CASE WORKERS FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PROVIDING PATIENTS WITH TRANSPORTATION THE SPECIALTY CARE AND OTHER VITAL PROGRAMS. THEY'RE OFTEN NOT EXPLICITLY REIMBURSED BY THE MEDICAID. PROGRAM THIS MEASURE BUILT ON A NATIONAL TREND WERE OVER FIFTEEN STATES HAVE ALREADY ENACTED SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PROTECTIONS ABOUT A DOZEN OTHERS. HAVE ACTIVE LEGISLATION MOVING ON THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW. I WILL POINT OUT THAT- THE IS A PRO AGAIN BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. AND PROVIDES A CRUCIAL FUNDING FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS- WE DO HAVE FORMAL OPPOSITION- THAT IS GOING TO TESTIFY IN TERMS OF- IN REGARDS TO THE- NATURE OF THESE- YOU KNOW- THESE ARE DISCOUNTS IN TRACKING AND SO FORTH. BUT I WANTED THIS TO KEEP IN MIND AGAIN THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN LONG STANDING THAT IS ACTUALLY AN STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL MEANT- THAT. ASIANS CAN CONTINUE TO GET THE SERVICES. THAT THEY NEED THAT OFTEN AGAIN OFTEN ARE NOT EXPLICITLY FUNDED. THROUGH OTHER MEANS AND SO- THIS BILLS IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SERVICES DON'T GET CAUGHT- IN- THE UPPER BEING PROVIDED BY SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. SO I HAVE WITNESSES. APOLLO HEALTH WHO'S HERE IN PERSON AND THE COAL SIDE- THAT- DIRECTOR OF PHARMACY SERVICES AT THE L. G. B. T. ALEXANDER L. G. P.

LA HEALTH WE'RE A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN LOS ANGELES THE PROVIDES PRIMARY CARE FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY. WE'RE ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST HIV SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTY AND A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. FREE KELLY HEALTH AT THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO THE pKAREN SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FREE OR LOW COST MEDICATIONS TO ALL OF OUR LOW INCOME PATIENTS THE PROGRAM ALL WHEN I WAS ASKED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO L. G. B. T. HEALTHCARE. ACROSS LA COUNTY AND IN ADDITION UNCOMPENSATED SERVICES LIKE AIR COORDINATION ENTRANCE. I THE PROP IS THAT THE TAX FROM ALSO. IT'S CONCERNING A. P. LA HEALTH SINCE LAST YEAR OVER A DOZEN. HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO LIMIT THE USE OF CONTRACT PHARMACIES. BECAUSE A. P. L. A. CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE AN IN HOUSE PHARMACY WE RELY ON A NETWORK OF TRUSTED COMMUTING RETAIL PHARMACIES. TO PROVIDE OUR PATIENTS WITH CONVENIENT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DRUGS. WITHOUT CONTRACT PHARMACIES A. PL A WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. AND OUR PATIENTS WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICATION. AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE LAST WEEK GILEAD SCIENCES A CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURER WITH TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD STOP OFFERING THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNTS FOR HEPATITIS C. DRUGS. THROUGH CONTRACT PHARMACIES AND LAST COVERED ENTITIES AGREED TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL CLAIMS DATA. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THE THREE FORTY B. STATUTE GIVES MANUFACTURERS THE RIGHT TO PLACE THESE TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS ON THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNTS. AND WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS ASSESSMENT. PRESIDENT BY THEN HHS AND OVER TWO HUNDRED REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE STATED THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE UNLAWFUL.

COVERED ENTITIES ARE ONLY REQUIRED ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ROBUST RECORDS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. IF A MANUFACTURER HAS CONCERNS THEY CAN REQUEST A FORMAL AUDIT. THE REASON THEIR DRUG MAKERS ARE TAKING THESE ACTIONS IS TO SCALE BACK THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE. CALIFORNIA MUST SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. IF LEFT UNCHECKED MANUFACTURERS WILL CONTINUE THESE ATTACKS ON THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM.

FORMER GREASE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM TRULY BENEFITS THE SAFETY NET THAT SERVES OUR UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY PHARMA IS OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT FURTHER DISTORTS THE SECOND LARGEST FEDERAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM. BUT FORCING MANUFACTURERS TO EXTEND THREE FORTY B. PRICING TO CONTRACT PHARMACIES WHICH ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE THREE FORTY B. STATUTE IN ADDITION ITS PROVISIONS DIRECTLY CONFLICT WITH THE FEDERAL THREE FORTY B. PROGRAMS RULES AND ENFORCEMENT REGIME. S. B. NINE THREE NINE WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE THREE FORTY BE DISCOUNTED DRUG SALES TO COVERED ENTITIES THROUGH. SPECIFIED CONTRACT PHARMACIES WHILE RESTRICTING MANUFACTURERS ABILITY TO IMPOSE REASONABLE CONDITIONS ON SALES OF COVERED DRUGS. THAT ARE ALLOWED BY THE FEDERAL THREE FORTY B. STATUTE. MANDATING MANUFACTURERS SHIP THREE FORTY B. DRUGS AT THREE FORTY BE CAUGHT- PRICES TO CONTRACT PHARMACIES BENEFITS CONTRACT PHARMACIES THOUSANDS OF WHICH ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT PATIENCE. IN FACT THE FIVE LARGEST FOR PROFIT PHARMACY CHAINS COMPRISE 60% OF THREE FORTY B. CONTRACT PHARMACIES NATIONWIDE. THESE THREE FORTY B.

I BELIEVE- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL HAD IT REPRESENT THE PHARMACEUTICAL CARE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION WITH THE NATIONAL PBM TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB NINE THIRTY NINE- SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE TWO PROVISIONS WHICH GIVE US A GREAT CONCERN FOR UNDER SUBSECTION BE THREE PLANS AND PBMS ARE PROHIBITED FROM REQUIRING PHARMACIES TO DISCLOSE WHICH DRUG BEING DISPENSED OR THREE FORTY B. DRUGS. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO HAVE A HIGHER- WE ADVERTISEMENT LOCAL YOU CAN STILL REQUIRE THAT BUT NOT REPENT WELL NOT PROHIBITING US FROM KNOWING WHICH ROADS. ARE PACKED WITH FORTY B.

AND CHANGE INVITES FRIED I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY THEN ENTER THE GENERAL PROCESS. SETTLE THE CASE OF A LARGE HOSPITAL WHICH HAD A FATHER- MEDI CAL TO THE TUNE OF TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THREE FORTY B.

WHICH ARE I LOST MAIL OR AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ONE TEXAS AND- OF THE BILL- WAS CRITICAL OF MAIL ORDER AND THIS THE FACT ALLOW IT. AND COMBINATION OF NOT ALLOWING US TO KNOW WHICH- COULD BE DRUGS TO BE DISPENSED PROBABLY AT THE COUNTER. DISPENSING MAIL- MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO KNOW WHICH THREATENED.

THANK YOU THIS IS ERIN REID BOURQUE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK UP HERE TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK YOU DOUG PAN AND I KNOW THIS IS A- AND THEN THE ISSUE VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND I KNOW YOU'RE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE NOT NOT THE SUNSET OF YOUR CAREER BUT YEAH. THE TIME IN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET THINGS DONE- THAT HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT AND HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO WORK ON AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM ACTUALLY THE SAVINGS GO TO THE PATIENT AND TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THE CARE. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THOSE- THOSE MEDICATIONS THE OPPOSITION TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE DANGER AROUND FRAUD- CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT FOR US ASKING THAT QUESTION- I THINK THAT I FIND IT INTERESTING- AGAIN APPRECIATE THE- TESTIMONY- BOTH FOREIGN OPPOSITION AND THEY TALK ABOUT- THE NEED FOR THEM TO TRACK TO BE SURE THAT. THERE'S AN FRAUDS. OF POINT OUT THAT THE ENTITY THAT'S ACTUALLY- RESPONSIBLE AND ACTUALLY WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE THERE'S FRAUD IS ACTUALLY THE COVERED ENTITY. SO THAT'S THE CLINIC OR THE HOSPITAL OR SO FORTHRIGHT. AND THEY'RE THE ONES WE TALK ABOUT CONTRACT PHARMACIES THEY'RE THE ONES OF THE CONTRACT THE PHARMACY. SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE PBM OR THE- PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER WHO'S HELD ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S ACTUALLY THE COVERED ENTITY AND IN FACT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. AND IN FACT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS- HAS A STRICT DEFINITIONS AS TO WHAT TO COVER AND IT AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE COVERED ENTITY AND THAT THE FUNDING HAS TO GO TO THE COVERED ENTITY AND THAT THE COVER AND YOU CAN ONLY SPEND THE MONEY ON THINGS TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. RIGHT THE FIRST THINGS I TALKED ABOUT MY TESTIMONY. SO IT'S KIND OF FASCINATING TO ME THAT THE- EDM AND THE IS SO INTERESTED IN DOING THE WRK OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THEM. TO ENFORCE THIS- ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S ACTUALLY THE COVERED ENTITY THAT IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND IF. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATES WHICH THEY DO- THAT THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY ARE ONCE AGAIN TROUBLE IT'S NOT THE PVM- THE CONCERN I THINK THAT- WE NEED TO NAVIGATE. IS TO ENSURE THAT. THE PBMS AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS DON'T- ESSENTIALLY- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CLINICS ARE SO FOUR TWO ARE GOING TO GET THE THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNT RATE SO IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF CUSTOMERS THAT SOME WHO I AM YOU KNOW I HAVE A DEAL AGREEMENTS ARE GOVERNMENT GONNA GIVE THAT DISCOUNT. ANOTHER ONES WHO DON'T WRITE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COVERED ENTITIES ARE NOT SERVING THE SAFETY AND SO FORTH. I'M GOING TO GET A HIGHER RATE RIGHT AND SO AND SO I THINK WHAT WE WANNA BE SURE IS THAT- WE DON'T HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE. THE VERY ENTITIES BY DEFINITION WHO ARE SERVING THE SAFETY NET. RIGHT SO I'M CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- TO BE SURE YOU KNOW WE WANT THE MONEY THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO BE SURE THAT DISCOUNT. THAT MONEY GOES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT RIGHT THAT THOSE PATIENTS ARE BEING SEEN IN THE STATION HOUSE ALSO CERTAINLY. HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS BUT ALSO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T DISADVANTAGE THE VERY INSTITUTIONS THE VERY THE- VERY PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF THEM. THAT WE DON'T DISADVANTAGE THEM AND THEN THEN AND ENTER PATIENTS THAT THEIR PATIENTS ARE GOING TO BE THIS ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCESS TO DRUGS JUST BECAUSE THEIR PARTICIPATION THROUGH FORTY B. PROGRAM. THANK YOU DOCTOR. AND I WOULD MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR EDMUND- ON MY LIST I HAVE SENATOR GROVE NEXT FOLLOWED BY SENATOR RUBIO AND THEN SENATOR LEE MOAN AS ANYONE ELSE SENATOR ROTH WISHES TO SPEAK ANYONE ELSE. AND SENATOR HER TANTO YOUR ANYONE WHO DOES NOT WISH TO SPEAK WITH YOU. NOW OKAY. YOU DON'T CONSIDER WHEN ALL RIGHT SENATOR GROUP PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE ONE OF THE LEAD WITNESSES IF THAT'S POSSIBLE MR PULSIPHER COULD I ASK YOU FEW QUESTIONS PLEASE. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AS THE AUTHOR JUST RESPONDED TO A QUESTION REGARDING SOME CONCERNS THAT WERE ADDRESSED. ON THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THE STATEMENTS THAT HE MADE WAS IT'S THE GOVERNMENT COVERS THE COVERED. ENTITY AND I'M ASSUMING AND I GET THIS I GUESS IS THE QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. I'M ASSUMING THAT THE COVERED ENTITY. IS THE ORGANIZATION LIKE THE LOS ANGELES L. G. B. T. THE LADY THAT TESTIFIED THAT OFFERS- LOWER DISCOUNTED PHARMACEUTICALS. CERTAIN PARCELS TO- AN ADVERSE OR RISK AT RISK COMMUNITY THAT'S THE COVERED ENTITY. CORRECT OR NOT. BREXIT IS THOSE PLANS IS THAT THE MEDICATIONS ARE SUPPLIED. TO EITHER TO THE COVER ANY ARE THE PEOPLE WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS. THAT'S THROUGH THE COVERED ENTITY RIGHT SO THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S AND WHO THE COVERED ENTITIES CAN BE IS DEFINED BY. A FEDERAL. REGULATION WHICH SERVES AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. YES THAT IS BY DEFINITION YES. IS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT THAT YOU WERE A CONTRACT. PHARMACY TO A COVERED ENTITY. AND YES SO IT HEALTH WERE OUT. HOW CENTERS WORK THREE FORTY B. COVERED ENTITY BUT WE CONTRACT WITH PHARMACIES TO DISPENSE MEDICATION SO SOME COVERED ENTITIES HAVE IN HOUSE PHARMACIES LIKE A LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER. WE DO NOT AND SO THE ONLY WAY FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS MEDICATION IS IF WE PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY IN RETAIL PHARMACIES. SO THAT'S WHERE MY QUESTION GOES SO THESE COMMUNITY AND RETAIL PHARMACIES DO THEY GET THE- THREE FORTY B. PRICING TO PROVIDE TO YOU. YES SO THE SO THREE FORTY B. DRUGS ARE ONLY DISPENSE TO PATIENTS OF THE COVERED ENTITY SO THAT CONTRACT PHARMACY IS NOT AT THREE FORTY B. COVERED ENTITY THOSE DISCOUNTED DRUGS CAN ONLY BE DISPENSED TO OUR PATIENTS. SO THE SET RETAIL CHAIN STORES OR OTHER OTHER. OTHER ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE TO YOU AS A COVERED ENTITY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT AND- WHEN THEY PURCHASE THESE DRAGS DO THEY GET THOSE DRUGS OR IN THEY GET THEM TO YOU AND YOU PROVIDE THEM TO YOUR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COVERED THAT ARE. DISADVANTAGED OR NEED TO BE HAVE A DISCOUNTED RATE. DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE THAT. AT THOSE SAME DRUGS AT THAT RATE. FOR ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVICE OTHER THAN A COVERED ENTITY NO THAT DISCOUNT IS ONLY EXTENDED TO THE THREE FORTY B. COVERED ENTITY NOT THE PHARMACY. AND YOU AS THE COVERED ENTITY BASED ON WHAT I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR SAID AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED BILL AND IT IS FOR ME IT IS AND OKAY WELL I'M GLAD IT IS FOR YOU. BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE INDUSTRY AND IT'S VERY COMFY SO THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THAT THE COVERED ENTITY IS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AND FOR MAKING SURE THAT THESE OTHER PEOPLE DON'T PROVIDE THESE DRUGS TO OTHER THAN THOSE THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THE COVERED ENTITY SO WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR SO PEER WHAT'S YOUR- AUDIT PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OTHER. THOSE CONTRACT PHARMACIES ARE NOT PROVIDING THOSE- NOT OBTAINING THOSE DRUGS AT A REDUCED COST INTO THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND THEN TURN AROUND AND SELLING THEM. IN OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS ANY PAY FIFTEEN CENTS AND SOMETIMES ITS BORDER DOLLARS UNDER RETAIL. SO WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT HAPPENING YEAH I'M IN THE SYSTEM YEAH. YES SO THE DISCOUNT IS PROVIDED TO US THE COVERED ENTITY NOT THE CONTRACT PHARMACY AND THEN WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH. THOSE PHARMACIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE NOT BEING DISPENSED OUR PATIENCE AND SO WE CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. WHO ESSENTIALLY LOOKS AT THESE CLAIMS TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THOSE DISCOUNTED DRUGS ARE BEING DISPENSED TO NON THREE FORTY BE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT PEACE BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT ARE THEY DISPENSING DRUGS TO OTHER PATIENTS. WHERE THEY PAY A REGULAR PRICE AND NOT AT THREE FORTY P. PRICE BUT YET BECAUSE THEY'RE A CONTRACT PHARMACY. T. U. THEY OBTAIN THE THREE FORTY B. PRICE PROGRAM AND THEY DISPENSE IT. TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE THREE FORTY B. PRICE PROGRAM IS THAT A POSSIBILITY. YEAH I MEAN I GUESS IS THE QUESTION IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THREE FORTY B. DRUGS TO BE DISPENSED TO NON THREE FORTY B. PATIENTS. SO FOR ME TO SEE IF I CAN MAKE IT A LITTLE SIMPLER SO I UNDERSTAND AN ANSWER IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M ASKING THAT I'D APPRECIATE A RESPONSE FROM YOU I'M TRYING TO ASK IF I AM UP CONTRACT PHARMACY. AND I'M ELIGIBLE TO GET THREE FORTY B. PRICING BECAUSE I'M PROVIDING PRICING TO YOU ARE IN PROVIDING PRODUCT TO YOU SO THAT YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE TO YOUR THREE FORTY B. PATIENTS. AND INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU SERVE THAT ARE UNDERSERVED THAT NEED HELP WITH PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES. BUT YET I CHOOSE TO TAKE THAT THAT PRODUCT THAT I GET AT THREE FORTY BE PRICEY AND I SELL IT TO DOCTOR PANTS FACILITY AND HE SELLS IT TO THE DOCTOR OR THE LAWYER THAT HE SERVES AT A REGULAR PRICE. AND THERE'S A PROFIT MARGIN THERE THAT'S NOT BEING AUDITED AND- NO OFFENSE SIR I'M JUST USING YOU AS AN EXAMPLE FOR DOCTOR PANTS FACILITY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW YEAH. AND I THINK YEAH. SO SERIOUSLY- THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS A CONTRACT PHARMACY SO WHAT HAPPENS YOU'RE SAYING LIKE OKAY FINE SOMEONE WROTE A PRESCRIPTION RIGHT. TO GO TO THE PHARMACY AND HOW DOES THE PHARMACY NO THAT'S THE FROM THE THREE FORTY B. ENTITY ALL RIGHT SOMEONE OR THEY'RE JUST ANOTHER COMMERCIAL PATIENT RIGHT AND SELF. INSERT AND GET THE DISCOUNT RATE SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS- THAT A PHARMACY CAN IDENTIFY SO ONE IS THAT THE WITH THE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS COULD HAVE A CARD THAT THE SHOW AT THE PHARMACY THAT WOULD BE ISSUED BY THE THREE FORTY. BY THE COVERED ENTITY- THE PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY PROVIDER WHO'S BOTH THE NAME AND ADDRESS MATCHES THE COVERED ENTITY- SO THAT SO THEY AND ACTUALLY THEY THERE SURE THE ADDRESSES AND I JUST THAT PROVIDING PEACE PROVIDER PRACTICE N MULTIPLE SETTINGS RIGHT SO THEY HAVE THAT ALL HAS TO MATCH. THEY ALSO DATA MATCHING SYSTEMS AS WELL COMPARED TO COVERED ENTITIES PATIENT THE PRESCRIPTION DATA WITH- WITH THE CONTRACT PHARMACY. SO THAT THERE ARE MEN THERE FROM MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH- TO ENSURE THAT. MEDICATION THAT IS ONLY THE DISCOUNT ONLY GOES TO SOMEONE. WHO IS BEING CARED FOR BY THE AVERRED ENTITY. I KNOW THE SO- AND IF THEY'RE NOT TO DO A THAT THEN- BECAUSE THE COVERED AT A ALSO HAS TO. OVERSIGHT OF THE PURCHASING AND DISPENSING RECORDS ALL RIGHT SO DON'T SO THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE PHARMACY. BUT THEY'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THE CONTRACT WITH THE PHARMACY THE CONTRACT PHARMACY. THEY NEED TO HAVE THE THEY NEED TO GET THE DATA BACK TO SAY OKAY WHO DID YOU DISPENSARY FORTY B. THINGS TO WRITE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO- THE SICKLY USUALLY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THE DISPENSING RECORDS AND THEY CAN GO WELL LOOK YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL MY PATIENTS WAIT A MINUTE HOW COME YOU'RE DISPENSING SOMEONE. ELSE THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS WAS AN THAT ALSO. NEEDS TO HAPPEN AS WELL SO THERE ARE THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES. TO BE SURE THAT THE- PERSON ACTUALLY GETTING. YOU KNOW GETTING THE PRESCRIPTION IS ACTUALLY A PATIENT OF IT QUALIFIES FOR OUR PATIENTS OF THE THREE FORTY B. THE COVERED ENTITY AND THAT THEY'RE NOT SOME OTHER PATIENT. AND THEY'RE JUST GETTING THE DISCOUNT SO YOU CAN CUT A PHARMACY CAN'T JUST GO AND SAY. OH BY THE WAY. I COULD. PHARMACY WE'RE JUST GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE DISCOUNTED DRUGS TO EVERY THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE RIGHT THE PROOF IN THE COVERED ENTITY WANTS THOSE RECORDS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE IN TROUBLE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT- WAIT A MINUTE. WE'RE DISPENSING THE DRUGS ARE BEING DISPENSED WITH THE THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNTS. TO PATIENTS WHO DON'T. DON'T QUALIFY. SO I GET THAT PIECE OF IT AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT FROM THE BEGINNING I THINK YOU FOR MAKING IT CLEAR- I GUESS I'M GOING TO THE MIDDLE SECTION SO. JUST IF THERE'S A HUNDRED PILLS DESCRIBED PRESCRIBED BY CONTRACT PHARMACY. THAT THEY GET THE THREE FORTY B. T. NINE. AND THEN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S THE COVERED ENTITY. SAYS I NEED. FORTY PILLS AND IT'S GOING TO GO ONE TO EACH OF THESE FORTY PATIENTS. AND THEN THERE'S SIXTY PILLS LEFT OVER. IS THERE AT A COVERAGE OR DISAPPEAR SENDING THAT MAKE SURE. THAT THAT CONTRACT FARMER CERTAIN PHARMACY WHO'S NOT. THE COVERED ENTITY AND RESPONSIBLE. FOR MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS OKAY SOMETIME ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. I DIDN'T. IS THAT. THAT PROTECTS M. ASSIST TAXPAYERS OR ANYBODY ELSE THAT THAT THOSE OTHER SIXTY PILLS ARE SOLD AT THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR PRICE WHEN THEY WERE PURCHASED BY THE CONTRACT PHARMACY. AT THE LOOP LOWER PRICE AT THREE FORTY P. PRICE IS THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THOSE SO AGAIN THE COVER AND AGAIN MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS IT BY ITS FINEST IN THE COVERED ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE SO THEREFORE AND SO THE CONTRACT PHARMACY THE REASON CALLED CONTRACT PHARMACY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE COVERED ENTITY AND IF THAT AND SO DO THE CONTRACT THE PHARMACY IS BE SURE THEY'RE NOT DISPENSING BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE COVERED ENTITIES. AGAIN BOTH OF THAT AND IT WAS GOING AND SAYING HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I SIXTY REBELS AND- I CAN GIVE IT TO OTHER PEOPLE. AND THE CUTTER AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THE PROVISIONS TO BE SURE THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING ON. AND THEY'RE DOING IT UNDER THE NAME OF THE COVERED ENTITY THAT COVERED ENTITIES THE ONE THAT GETS THAT ACTUALLY COULD LOSE THEIR STATUS AS A COVERED ENTITY AND THEREFORE LOSE. THE ENTIRE C. FORTY B. PROGRAM FOR THEIR OWN ENTITY BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHAT'S WHAT'S- THE NAME OF THE CONTRACT YET JUST TO SEE YEAH AND JUST IF YOU COULD. WELL THIS IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THREE NINE FORTY BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT MARGIN IN HERE FOR SOMEONE. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE LOCAL COVERED ENTITY OR THE PERSON WHO'S IN THE DEAD CENTER OF LOS ANGELES SERVICING THEM. PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT'S SOMEWHERE UP THE CHAIN AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN EARN FORTY DOLLARS DOESN'T EXIST- I THINK IT DOES EXIST. AND SO MY QUESTION IS THAT- FOR. ARE THEY COVERED ENTITY. IN SOME OF THIS MAY SOMEHOW AND THERE. THAT FOR A SERVER. FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SERVE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THREE NINE FORTY BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT MARGIN IS IN THERE. WHEN WE'RE GIVING- DRAGS. ON THREE FORTY B. WE'RE GIVING THREE FORTY B. DRUGS AT A DISCOUNTED RATE TO LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS% OR HOSPITALS OR CLINICS. THAT ARE SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE MERGERS AND MY SIDE OF OUR SOCIETY THAT MAKES SENSE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK JUST TO BE CLEAR SO THERE IS SOME SAVINGS THERE THAT'S GENERATED BY THE COVERED ENTITY WHEN THEY PURCHASE A DRUG AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE CONTRACT PHARMACY RECEIVES A PORTION OF THAT SAVINGS POOREST DISPENSING THAT MEDICATION THOSE CONTRACTS VARY DEPENDING ON THE COVERED ENTITY IN THE PHARMACY BUT THE MAJORITY OF THAT SAVINGS STAYS WITH THE COVERED ENTITY. AND THEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO USE THAT THAT SAVINGS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR UNDERSERVED PATIENTS. OKAY SO THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME AND THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION I THINK SO FROM A COVERED ENTITY AT LOS ANGELES LIKE THE MRS T. BENNETT WAS ON THE PHONE. AND I HAVE A CONTRACT PHARMACY AND I GET THE DRUGS FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I'M ABLE TO GET. TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDERSERVED AND THEN I CAN IN TURN. USE THOSE RESOURCES WITH A CONTRACT WITH YOU- I MAKE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHICH ADDS TO MY BOTTOM LINE AND I CAN PROVIDE MORE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY I SERVE. IS THAT CORRECT EXACTLY. SO THAT'S YEAH THE COVERED ENTITY THE SAFE NET PROVIDER THAT SAVING SO THEY CAN USE EXPAND SERVICES AND THAT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING THE THREE FOURTY BILL DOLLARS. YEAH OKAY AND THAT'S WHAT THE WAS INTO TO DO BY KONG. OKAY I WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- OKAY THANK THAT SENSE TO ME THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND MANY THAT THE I AND I UNDERSTAND THE PHARMACEUTICAL SIDE OF IT NOW AND BELIEVE ME I WASN'T I DON'T SEE HIM TAKING THEIR SIDE BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE A BIG. ON OVER THIS. I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR THE OTHER BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATED IT. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME UNDERSTAND IT MORE. S. THROUGH THE TERROR- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S TWO SUITS FILED AGAINST- THE PROGRAM AS IT IS IT WILL THIS BILL IF IT'S PASSED- AFFECT THE- OUTCOME OF THE LAWSUITS BECAUSE IT IS IN LITIGATION RIGHT NOW. NOT THAT I'M NOT THAT I PERSONALLY AWARE OF THIS IS US THIS IS A STATE LAW SO THERE'S I THINK BELIEVED TO. HANDLE ALL THE DETAILS OF THE LAWSUITS BUT- INTENDED IT'S BASED AROUND- YOU KNOW WHO. WHO QUALIFIES AS A COVERED ENTITY AT CENTER AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE OKAY I THINK. WE WILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY CALLS FOR WHATEVER THE FEDERAL DEFINITION IS WELL IN FORCE AGAINST. SO WHATEVER DILIP BALCOMBE THE LAWSUIT IS REGARDING WHO GETS THE FIND IT THAT'S WHAT'S BILLED BY TWO. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR IT FOR TOLERATING MY QUESTIONS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE THREE TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE WAS. ROUGHLY THREE TO FOUR WHERE IS IT GOING. YEAH AND IF I MAY JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT- I MEAN- THE- AND THEY SAY THAT'S PROFITABLE AGAIN THE MONEY THAT COMES OUT OF THE FROM THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM BETWEEN THAT THAT THAT THAT COVERED ENTITIES GET. BY LAW. THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT SO IT'S ME CAUGHT WE CAN CALL PROFIT BUT FIRST HONESTLY AS A NOT FOR PROFIT BUT THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT ON EXPANDING PATIENT CARE SERVICES AGAIN OFTENTIMES THEY'RE SPENDING IT ON THINGS THAT WE DON'T EXPLICITLY REIMBURSE. SO THAT'S THE CONSPIRACY THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS BILL IS TO BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SERVICES CUT YEAH WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO. SO I THINK THAT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY HAVE COMMUNITY CENTER I THINK GIVE ME HEALTH CENTERS IN YOUR YOUR OWN DISTRICT THEY'RE PROVIDING YOU KNOW LOTS OF SUPPORTING PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE TRANSPORTATION OTHER TYPES OF THINGS GETTING IN. WE DON'T WANT THOSE THINGS GET TIGHT- THE SAID SERVICE GETTING CUT- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND I DON'T WANT THE SERVICES TO GET CUT IN YOUR DISTRICT MY DISTRICT OR ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK THERE'S A VIABLE A- AND- IF YOU ARE ON A PRO. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO OBTAIN. PHARMACEUTICALS AT A LOWER DISCOUNTED RATE BUT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL THEM AT A HIGHER RATE. AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT. NOT TO THE COVERED PEOPLE. BUT OUTSIDE OF THE COVERED PEOPLE AND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA YOU SHOULD WELL THEY SHOULD BE SOLD IT'S IF YOU'RE PATIENT THE COVERED ENTITY DON'T YOU DOES THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN GET. THE DISCOUNTS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WHY OR STAND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY MAY HAVE. CONTACTED UP THE CONTRACT PHARMACY YEAH WELL THE CONTRACT PHARMACIES ARE YOU KNOW THAT SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN IN HOUSE PHARMACY RIGHT AS YOU HEARD FROM THE WITNESS. YOU MAY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE PHARMACY BECAUSE AGAIN YOU ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE OTHER THING IS OF COURSE PEOPLE GET THEIR MEDICATIONS AND DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO DID YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE THAT'S CONVENIENTLY CLOSE TO THEM RIGHT SO IMAGINE YOU HAVE. MEALS IN A ROW HEALTH CENTER RIGHT TO SERVING VERY LARGE AREA RIGHT SO THEY MAY ACTUALLY HAVE. EVEN IF THEY HAD AN IN HOUSE PHARMACY- PEOPLE MAY SAY WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN I CAN I GO TO SOME PLACES CLOSE TO THE MAY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PHARMACIES OTHERS YOU KNOW TO ME PHARMACIES OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE THOSE MEDICATIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND THERE IS A AGAIN THERE'S THAT THERE'S A PROCESS FOR RE CONCILIATION AND OTHER THINGS. INSURE THAT THOSE DISCOUNTED PHARMACY. PHARMACEUTICALS CAN ONLY GO TO PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING SEEN SERVED BY THAT COVERED ENTITY NOT ANY OTHER PATIENTS. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO EMPHASIZE. THE END AND WE I GUESS WE- SEE THAT DIFFERENT WAYS- AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. IS THAT IT'S ONLY ADDRESSING THE INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE COVERED ENTITY PROGRAM. AND NOT OUTSIDE OF THAT WHERE THEY HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE SAME DRUGS. AT THE REDUCED COST. THAT'S WHERE I THINK. THERE'S A PROBLEM. THANK YOU THOUGH FOR LETTING YOU TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. OKAY YEAH WE SENATOR RUBIO YOU'RE UP. THANK YOU- CHAIR I WANT TO SAY I AGREE WITH SHANNON OR DISAGREE BUT I GOT LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE DISCUSSION HERE- FOR ANYBODY LISTENING TO IT SO YOU KNOW REALLY TECHNICAL AND DOUBT REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND SO I'M SEEING THAT SORT OF FAR FROM WHAT SHE SAID IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY I HEARD. ON IT I KNOW SHE WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE POINT OF IS THERE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD AND- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE SAVINGS I DO HAVE TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENTS WERE TRYING TO HELP OR OR THE CLIENTS I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE THAT WE CAN BE DOING MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE DISCOUNT. THAT THREE FORTY B. DISCOUNT DRUG RATE IS. PASS ALONG TO THE CONSUMER WHAT I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE AS THEY DID HERE- YOU'RE IN SOMEBODY'S TESTIMONY THAT THERE IS A PROHIBITION IN TERMS OF DISCLOSURE FROM THREE FORTY P. DRUGS TO THE- NON. AT THREE FORTY B. PATIENTS AND I GUESS THAT IF THERE'S A LACK OF INFORMATION THERE SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE YEAH. CAN WE DO MORE. TO DISCLOSE AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENT NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS. VERY TRICKY BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO RELY AS I THINK SHANNON WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN SORRY JUST- SENATOR GROWTH OKAY- YOU KNOW THAT POTENTIAL IN BETWEEN FOR. OFF FOR PEOPLE NOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING SUCH AS CAN YOU SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY CAN WE ADD. MAYBE MORE DISCLOSURES WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT BETTER SO I HAVE THINGS THAT I SAY I THINK- AS I MENTIONED IS THAT. I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK SERRA GROVE IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THE SAVINGS SKILLS HELP PATIENTS. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE DISCOUNT IN FACT THAT'S WHY THE LAW. ON THREE FORTY V. SAYS. THAT THE QUAKE JUST CAN'T SPIT OUT ANYTHING THAT IS THEY NEED TO. SPEND ON THINGS THAT THAT THAT SUSPICIONS. AND OF YOU KNOW POTENTIAL. AND SO FORTH ARE OUT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO RIGHT SO THERE ARE- SO- YOU CAN TELL ME HOW MANY STORIES OF FRAUD AND SO FORTH I'M NOT SAYING THAT DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL BUT- YOU KNOW THE- THE AGENCY THE FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN MONITORING THIS PROGRAM. THEY'VE DONE AUDITS AND SO FORTH- THEN THE QUESTION IS THAT- L. WHO SHOULD BE THE ONES TO MONITOR. THE FRAUD RIGHT- SO CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL AGENCY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE THREE FORTY P. PROGRAM- IS. IS INVOLVED- THE HEALTH RESOURCE SERVICE ADMINISTRATION. THEY MONITOR DATE DO AUDITS IT'S CETERA. THE QUESTION IS THAT THERE'S A THE POINTED OUT A LITTLE EARLIER IS THAT. SO THE PBMS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CERTAINLY ARE SO THAT YOU KNOW ARE INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY DOING THAT ROLE SO THE QUESTION IS WHY. WHAT YOUR AFTER ALL IT'S THEIR DID NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY'RE NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE WHO NEGOTIATES WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR THREE FORTY DISCOUNTS ALREADY SO INTERESTED. AND NOW SUDDENLY BEING THE ENFORCERS- IT JUST OUT OF THEIR OWN YOU KNOW IS IT JUST OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART NOW AND MAYBE- BUT- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T. THAT WE DON'T DISADVANTAGE THE PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY HAVE AN AGREEMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY'RE GETTING A DISCOUNT RIGHT AND- YOU KNOW THE PBMS THEY WORK IF THEY HAVE REBATES AND SO FORTH. AND SO THE QUESTION IS THAT. YEAH I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO AGAIN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITE. SPOKE TO SAYING WE WANTED WE STAMP OUT FRONT RIGHT WE WANT THAT MONEY TO GO- PROPERLY TO THE PATIENTS WHO NEED HELP RIGHT AND AGAIN THIS PROGAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. SO WE WANNA BE SURE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND SO THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO TO GET. THAT DONE ARE YOU SURE THAT THAT'S GREAT. WELL I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN THOUGH IS WE TRY DON'T WANT TO. THEMSELVES WHO ARE THE PATIENTS OF THE COVERED ENTITY TO BE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE- NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE HAVE ENTITIES MAY HAVE OTHER INTERESTS AS WELL. IN FINDING OUT THIS INFORMATION THAT MAY BE USED TO DISADVANTAGE THEM TO MAKE THE DRUGS LESS AVAILABLE TO THEM. RIGHT BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY'RE NOT GETTING MAKING AS MUCH MONEY ON THESE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GIVE A DISCOUNT. SO THE QUESTION IS WHICH AND- ARE THE BEST ENTITIES. TO ACTUALLY TRACK THE FRONT. AND SO CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION- TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF REPORTING NEEDS TO HAPPEN IF WE DON'T. YOU KNOW DON'T- IF YOU THINK THAT COVERED ENTITIES WHO ACTUALLY ARE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE- DEAL THAT DID THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OVER THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT I DID WANT TO ALSO BE SURE THAT. THE ENTITIES ARE DO OVERSEE THIS RIGHT SO YOU THAT THAT. THAT THIRD APPROPRIATE ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING THE OVERSIGHT AND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE OTHER INTERESTS THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH. ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS. SO I DID THAT SO I THINK THAT'S- THE THAT'S THE- THAT'S- AND THEN CERTAINLY AGAIN. NOW THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE- SELL PRE SHAPED- YOU KNOW GETTING SOME OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. WITH THE WITH ITH FOLKS ON THIS. BUT AGAIN. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN THE REASON I DECIDE TO CARRY THIS BILL WHEN THE WHEN THE SPONSORS APPROACH ME IS THAT I WANT TO BE SURE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE. CUTS IN THESE SERVICES. RIGHT BECAUSE AS THIS IS IT SAYS THIS THINGS MOVING ALONG. THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM WHICH AGAIN HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO IS A BIT UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THIS IS. YOU KNOW- THAT THAT- DOES PROVIDE DISCOUNTED MEDICATIONS AND- UNFORTUNATELY THERE YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WHO DO ARE JUST AS YOU KNOW WHO WHO ARE NOT. HIGH INCOME AND SO FORTH TO DEPEND ON THESE MEDICATIONS. AND AND ALSO AS THE IRONICALLY EVEN AS- SOME MEDICATIONS YOU KNOW NEW MEDICATION COMING OUT WHICH ARE BECOME VERY YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE. THESE DISCOUNTS BECOME. EVER MORE. TO THE TO PATIENTS WHO ARE THREE FORTY B. TO VOTE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACT GET ACCESS TO THEM SO- SO I CERTAINLY WANT AGAIN WORK WITH- WITH FOLKS- BUT- I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN DISAGREED THAT. LET'S GO AHEAD. YEAH AND- THAT. THE SERVICES THAT THESE PATIENTS GET. DON'T GET CUT AND THAT WE TRY TO DETER BRACKETS ALL THE OTHER DISCOUNTS THIS. THAT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THOSE SERVICES AND THAT- WE CONTINUE TO. TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE NOW IT'S YOU KNOW ONE THING I WOULD ALSO JUST SORT OF POINT OUT IS THAT. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THESE OTHER SERVICES. THAT'S ALL BIGGER DISCUSSION AND I WOULD STAND ON THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME DEBATE ABOUT THAT. GOSH WE MORE EXPLICITLY FUNDED INSTEAD OF MAKING IT IMPLICITLY FUNDED IS THAT THESE ARE OFTEN COVERING SERVICE THAT ARE EXPLICITLY REIMBURSED I MAYBE WE OUGHT TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY. THAT'S THE ONLY. FOR A- DISCUSSION. WELL THAT. LET'S HAVE THIS CUT BECAUSE WE THEN OF THIS PROGRAMS ESSENTIALLY FAIL ARE ARE ARE ARE YOU GONNA GET NARROWED IT WELL WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE LARGE THAT THAT OTHER QUESTIONS AS WELL SO- SO CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT'S GOING. THANK YOU- I HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND-HEAR FROM HIS HARI. AND I AGREE WITH YOU- A DOCTOR PANNED OUT YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY THE- CLINICS HAVE BEEN UNDERFUNDED AND- WE DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE SAFETY NET IS THERE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND- AND TAKE THEIR LIKE OR CLEAN. LOCAL CLINICS HAVE BEEN HURT BY HIT THE PANDEMIC YELLS IT TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU KNOW NOW THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN HERE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO BUT- IT. MY QUESTION. OKAY NOW THAT I THIS CASE THAT I HAD SAID RECENTLY. BUT THIS HAD DOES NOT TO DO IT CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO WITH ARKANSAS RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE IN YOU NEED TO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT. THEY FOUND THAT THERE IS- IT THERE'S A DISRUPTION TO THE FEDERAL THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND SOMEHOW DIRECTLY CONFLICTS WITH AT THREE FORTY P. STAT. SHEET SO. IT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE THAT THE RECENT RULING WHICH ISN'T A VIRUS VERSUS HAS BEEN NO SUCH AS THAT. EIGHT AND BACK TO YOU DON'T YOU GIVE YOU AN ACCURATE ANSWER- I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY WITNESSES ARE FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THAT CASE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT- SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE CALL- BUT COULD COULD COULD ADDRESS THAT. YEAH I MEAN I KNOW THERE IS ON GOING TO THE GATE CAN AN ARKANSAS OVER LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THERAPIST NOT SURE IF IT'S THIS SPECIFIC CASE OR NOT. WHAT IS THE RECENT FEDERAL COURT DECISION SO THERE HAS BEEN A DECISION BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GET BACK TO ME ON UP OKAY I'M- A BETTER. IT DOES. I WAS. IT'S AN GET OUT OF. WE WOULD JUST LAUGH I WILL SAYING. MAYBE BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR YOU CORRECTLY THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST OUT TEST- WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED. I'D BETTER MAKE A STATEMENT THAT. SINCE OUR BEANS. US SENT OUT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND I HEARD A NUMBER 60% AGAIN MIGHT BE THAT. EARLY ON IT I HEARD A IN- AND THEY- S. SHIN DIRECT MAIL. ORDER TO STAY- YOU KNOW CAN WE KEEP TRACK. OF WHAT'S SOLD HERE IN THE STATES OF ITSELF A LOT THROUGH MAIL I MEAN JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT STATEMENT WAS I MAY BE WRONG. CAN YOU MENTION- OUTSIDE YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS A STATEMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION. ANDSO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION WITH THEM ABOUT THAT CONCERN. OKAY AND ACTUALLY CAN I ALSO HAVE- BUT I KNOW SHE'S ON THE LINE I CAN I ALSO HAVE NICOLE TYPO ALSO PERHAPS CAN YOU CAN YOU. THAT THAT THE FROM THE OP. THERE IS. JOHN IS THAT YOU KNOW CALL. YES YES I'M HERE WOULD YOU MND. THE QUESTION PLEASE. YOU KNOW I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK I KNOW AT THE COVERED ENTITY UNDER BOTH OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM WE CANNOT SEND OUT OF STATE. WE DO NOT SEND ANY MEDICATION OUT OF STATE AND I CAN'T- I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT CONDITION UNDER WHICH YOU COULD- SO I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION IT DIDN'T WANT TO JUST REALLY QUICK JUMP IN AND MENTION THAT. COVERED IT. HAVE RIGHT AUDIT. AND SELL ALL OF THE TIME WE ARE. OUT WENT. BY ONE OR THE OTHER SO THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. AT FIRST I HAVE THE RIGHT THAT'S SO WE ARE VERY THEORY HIGHLY MONITORED ON SO I'M NOT SURE WHY. THE MANUFACTURERS AND PBMS WOULD BE BEYOND. ALREADY TOO WHAT. IT DOES. I THANK YOU AND IT MAY THE PERHAPS IT HELPFUL AS ARE REVIEWED THE PERSON WHO MADE THE STATEMENT THAT 60% WERE SENT OUT OF STATE IS THAT. MEDITATION CENTER STATED THAT BECAUSE THE- SEA WAS HEADQUARTERED OUT OF STATE. AT THE TRAPS IT'D BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT CLARIFICATION FROM THE PERSON MADE STATEMENT. WHAT EXACTLY DID HE MEAN BY THAT. BUT YOU KNOW I'LL JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I HEARD AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS IT SINCE I HEARD IT BUT I'LL JUST MOVE FORWARD CLEARLY. THERE'S A LOT OF LINGERING QUESTIONS FOR ME AGAIN NOT BECAUSE IT IT'S A BAD BILL OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST THAT IT IS A VERY INTENSE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD HERE AT THE TOP. I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE AND- SENATOR PAT THAT HE WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT HE JUST DATE ITSELF I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT THANK YOU I KNOW IT'S BEEN NOT. IDENTIFY I LOOK FOR IS HERE MORE DETAILS IN THE NEAR FUTURE YOU GUYS UP WITH AN- AND ANOTHER. THANK YOU. AND IF YOU. AND LONG TIME I THINK ON THE POINT OF COLLECTING DATA AT ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT I THINK DATA CAN BE COLLECTED TO ASSESS FRONT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT COULD JUST BE COLLECTED- AND IN THE ROOM AND IT'S ALSO USEFUL IS TO UNDERSTAND YOUR YOU KNOW PATIENT NEEDS AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE TRENDS ARE AT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE MEDICINES- AND SO FORTH SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A BIG POINT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT- THE ABILITY TO. TO TRACK- AND REQUEST DATA THAT'S USED AND SO I WANT TO TAKE IT NOT JUST FROM BLENDS IT'S ONLY BECAUSE- ONCE THE TRACK FRAUD AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT TAKES. THING THE MEDICINE THE BEING USED. BUT MICHAEL. HAS TO DO WITH A THEME THAT THAT HAS COME UP SO MUCH AT TODAY WHICH IS THEABILITY TO HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PHARMACIES AND I REPRESENT A REGION THAT'S UNIQUE YOU KNOW MULTI COUNTY VERY LARGE AND I HAVE A URBAN HUBS I HAVE RULE HUGS- AND CERTAINLY GET ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICINES FOR THE NEEDIEST. WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO DO- HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US BUT ALSO PRESENTSQUITE A NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS SO AS I HEARD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT CONTRACTING WITH PHARMACIES- I THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT AND I REPRESENT ME BE ABOUT EIGHTY NINE NINETY ZIP CODES AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND AT LEAST HALF OF THOSE IF NOT MORE DON'T HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PHARMACIES IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY AND SO YOU SEE THAT YOU FOR EXAMPLE HOSPITALS MAY HAVE TO OR CHOOSE TO. CONTRACT OUT OF STATE AND NOT WITH MY LOCAL PHARMACY SO I'M NOT SURE WHO TO ASK UNTIL AND SO I'M CAN YOU RESPOND AND HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE CONTRACTS WITH FAR ARE ARE GOING HELLO FOR IN. THEIR HAPPENING OUT OF STATE AND HOW DOES ONE THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT COULD PROVIDE WHAT IT MEANS TO THE ALTERNATE GOAL THAT I SHARE WITH YOU WHICH IS HOW TO GET AFFORDABLE. MEDICINE TO THOSE YOU KNOW WHO MOST NEED IT CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT AND HELP ME THINK THROUGH AN ISSUE LIKE THAT YEAH AND AN ATTACK- BEAR FOR VALVE THE NATIONAL ANSWER AND HAVE A FOLLOW UP HERE BECAUSE I'D THINK FOR. MANY COVERED ENTITIES THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE YOU ARE RIGHT IF YOUR. MANAGER IS VERY LARGE. IF YOU IN THE HOUSE. THAT MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THEIR WAY OFF. YOU YOU'RE ONE CLINIC- OR WHATEVER IT IS TO GET TO THEIR MEDICATION THINK ABOUT REFILLS AND SO FORTHRIGHT. SO IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO SERVE THE POPULATION THAT THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE OTHER YOU KNOW PHARMACY SAID THAT THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TO BE ALL SET UP THEIR OWN PHARMACY EVERYWHERE RIGHT IN THE HOLE IN THE WHOLE AREA. SO I CONTRACT PHARMACY MAY MAKE SENSE NOW EXACTLY DO THE CONTRACT WITH AND WHY. THAT'S THE L. THAT'S NOT REALLY MUCH- I DON'T MAKE THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS- SO WHY DO THEY CHOOSE THE CONTRACT WITH ONE PHARMACY AND NOT ANOTHER. BUT MAYBE I'LL GO AND PASS IT TO MISS TYPE OF TALK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW. SOLID COVERED ENTITIES SITE YOU KNOW. MAKE DECISIONS ON. WHO THE CONTRACT WITH AND- AND WHY THEY CONTRACT WITH THE PHARMACY. YEAH I MEAN APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE STATE PHARMACIES TO BE HONEST THIS IS. THE FIRST TIME I'M HEARING ABOUT THIS CONCERNS WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS FOR I CAN SPEAK FROM A P. LA OUR GOAL TO ACCESS TO MEDICATION FOR PATIENTS SO THAT MEANS HAVING ACCESS TO A PHARMACY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO WE CONTRACT WITH. ONE COMMUNITY PHARMACIES THAT ARE THERE ARE CLINICS SO PATIENTS CAN ACCESS MEDICATION- I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE OUT OF STATE ISSUE BUT WOULD HAPPY TO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THIS MORE. YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S JUST THAT YOU KNOW ON A LOT OF HEALTH ISSUES THIS IS MY SIXTH YEAR HON HEALTH COMMITTEE- AND I MEAN AND CERTAINLY THE REGION MATTERS. AND IF YOU ARE IN A COMMUNITY LIKE- YAMA- AND YOU DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT THERE WITH THE PHARMACY I MEAN. THAT'S A PRETTY. YOU KNOW LOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THAT'S GOING TO NEED AND CAN BENEFIT IF THAT YOU KNOW FROM THIS. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TRADES ARE THE TRADE OFFS ARE- IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LIKE I SAID I'M NOT AS WORRIED ABOUT COMMUNITIES IN OCTOBER THERE'S TONS OF HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. THERE BUT IT'S SOME OF MY OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT THAT HAVE MUCH MORE. LIMITED AND YOU SEE THIS TREND OF LIKE. WE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THIS YOU KNOW HAVE ACCESS TO THAT- AND SO IT. OF TELLS UP SO IF WE COULD. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN ALL JUST HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS I AM CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I APPRECIATE THIS BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A THREE FORTY B. CONVERSATION- SO THANK YOU. IF OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR LEMON WE'LL MOVE ON TO SENATOR RON. THANK YOU MA'AM BYE SURE THIS ISA PRETTY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND EVERY TIME WE PICK UP ONE OF THESE THREE FORTY BILL BE BILLS I HAVE TO. GO BACK AND TRY TO REFRESH MY VERY OLD BRAIN WHAT'S LEFT OF IT AS TO HOW THIS THING WORKS. AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES. THREE FORTY B. PATIENCE I DIDN'T FIND A DEFINITION OF THAT IN THE MATERIAL BUT I ASSUME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PATIENT OF A COVERED ENTITY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE THREE FORTY BE PATIENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WERE AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED. AND HAS BEEN DESIGNED FROM ITS OUTSET TO HELP COVERED ENTITIES USER THESE ARE CLINICS THESE ARE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS A VARIETY OF OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE LISTED BOTH IN OUR ANALYSIS AND A BILL. TO HELP THESE COVERED ENTITIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE VARIOUS SERVICES BY BY REDIRECTING OR DIRECTING MONEY TO THEM ESSENTIALLY THE DELTA BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT AND WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY BILL. THE PAIR. AND THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE PHARMACIES ARE LOCATED IN THIS THAT ANOTHER AND MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES THIS THAN THE OTHER AND I DON'T RECALL WHETHER THEY'RE APPROVED BY PERMITTED BY FEDERAL OR NOT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN I AM BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS DELTA AND IT WAS IMPORTANT FRANKLY BEFORE WE. SHOTS BUT WILSON COUNTY HOSPITALS TO HELP THEM STAY AFLOAT AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM APPLIES WHETHER THE KING OF THE COVERED ENTITY IS ULTIMATELY REIMBURSE FOR THE DISPERSED. UP PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE PHARMACEUTICAL BUT BY MEDIC COW REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY GET IT FROM MEDICARE- MEDICARE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. YOU SHOULDN'T SERVE THEM PATIENTS THEMSELVES. THESE CONTRACT PHARMACIES- THEY CONTRACT WITH THESE COVERED ENTITIES TO DISPENSE THREE FORTY B. DRUGS. ON THE COVERED ENTITY'S BEHALF AND I THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE BUT I THINK THAT PHRASE WHICH IS IN OUR ANALYSIS IS KEY THEY DISPENSE ON THE COVERED ENTITIES. BUT I HAVE SO THE DISCOUNT IS THE COVERED ENTITY'S DISCOUNT NOT THE PHARMACIES DISCOUNT AND M. AS THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES THIS HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. CONDUCTS DOES THE ANALYSIS SAYS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO AUDITING. THE COVERED ENTITIES IN THE PHARMACIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DISCOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATELY PROVIDED AND I NOTICED ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS ALSO MADE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE PBMS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE SEEM TO BE DEALING WITH A LOT. BUT BOTH OF THOSE OPERATIONS HAVE THE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND PRESUMABLY EXERCISE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGULARLY AUDIT. THE COVERED ENTITIES IN THE CONTRACT PHARMACIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DISCOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATELY APPLIED. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COVERED ENTITY PATIENTS PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE BETTER THE OTHER BEING FILLED SO. LOOK AT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTINUED QUESTIONS THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR CURRENT FORMAT IS I DON'T HAVE THE SPEAKERS IN FRONT OF ME AT THE PANEL. BECAUSE SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN THE CHAIR COMMITTEES I ENJOYED TAKING EACH ONE OF THEM IN ASKING A SERIES OF DETAILED QUESTIONS I CANNOT DO THAT TODAY. BUT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE BILL WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE TODAY AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T. I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA THE MANUFACTURERS ARE FOREVER THAT WAS IT SPOKE WANT TO RECEIVE FROM THE COVERED ENTITY'S AND THE CONTRACT PHARMACIES WHAT DATA. IT IS THEY WANT TO GET THAT I ALSO WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT DATA THEY GET. THE MONTHLY- BUT IT'S THE DAY IN THE PBMS CONDUCT OF THE COVERED ENTITY'S AND THE CUT CONTRACT PHARMACIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS ISSUE REALLY IS. FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PROFIT. MAYBE I MISSED IT IN THE ANALYSIS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY DATA ANY SPECIFIC DATA. ON THAT ON THAT PROFITABILITY FACTOR THAT APPARENTLY. SOME ARE ALLEGING THAT LARGE PHARMACIES OR OR- ARE REALIZING ON THIS THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM SO I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING THANK YOU DUCK PLAN FOR BRINGING THIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH THE FOLKS HAVE SPOKEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS. IN MY OFFICE OR OTHERWISE TO ASK A FEW MORE THANK YOU. PLACE YOUR- THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH- SENATOR WHO TAUGHT WANT TO START OFF WITH A SAME THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING LEGISLATION TODAY OBVIOUSLY IT LIKE. OTHERS ARE OTHER COLLEAGUES ON THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE- I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WALK THROUGH MY THINKING PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THAT I'VE HAD OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AND I START OFF WITH DOING YOUR RESEARCH ON MY OWN RIGHT TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. DOES WHO IT UP YOU KNOW- WHAT APPLIES TO WHAT IT COVERED AND LIKE. WHAT IS A COVERED ENTITY TO BEGIN WITH RIGHT AND I THAT WAS THE FIRST. MY FIRST QUESTION AND- UNDER THE FAIR AND UNDER MY RESEARCH I FOUND THAT- PHARMACIES ARE ALSO INCLUDED AS PART OF A COVER DEFINED AS A COVERED ENTITY IS THAT IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE WELL I MEAN THEY CUT COVERED ENTITIES CONTRACT WITH PHARMACIES BUT PHARMACIES THEMSELVES ARE NOT COVERED ENTITIES OKAY BUT THAT COULD BE BE A COVERED ENTITY WELL ON THEIR OWN IF YOU'RE A FAR WELL L. AT A PHARMACY IT STANDS ALONE I MEAN YOU HAVE COVERED ENTITIES THAT OPERATE FROM THAT THAT MAY HAVE PHARMACIES. IT'S NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME MAY OPERATE A FARM A FARM A PHARMACY ESSENTIALLY WITHIN THEIR INSTITUTION LIKE A HOSPITAL LIKE A SAFETY NET HOSPITAL MAY HAVE A PHARMACY YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A FEDERAL DEFINITION OF A THREE FORTY B. COVERED ENTITY- SO THAT INCLUDES COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS RYAN WHITE CLINICS AS THE EYE CLINICS TITLE TEN PROVIDER CERTAIN HOSPITALS BUT PHARMACIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION. AND OKAY BECAUSE I. THE WEBSITE I WAS WAS BETTER WEBSITE EIGHT THAT'S YEAH UNDER THERE HAS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND THEN HAS SEVERAL. HAS DOCTORS CLINICS PSYCHOLOGIST- PHARMACIES MAYBE MAYBE I READ IT WRONG MAYBE IT WAS IT WAS REALLY LATE SO I WILL SAY THAT- WAT I ALSO FOUND IS THAT. THAT THERE'S COVERED ENTITIES AND BUSINESSES. WHICH I WOULD ASSUME THAT. BUSINESS ASSOCIATES BEING CONTRACT PHARMACIES. YEAH YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM NICOLE MIGHT BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM. AND I WOULD TAKE THAT TO BE OUR CONTACT PHARMACY BUT AS- NOW I'M I'M I'M NOT CERTAIN WHAT THEY MEANT EITHER. BECAUSE IT SAYS HERE IT'S BEEN ON THE WEBSITE HERE IT SAYS THAT THE HIPPA RULES APPLY TO COVERED ENTITIES AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATES- INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A COVERED ENTITY UNDER HIPAA MUST COMPLY WITH THE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF HEALTH. IT ALSO GOES ON TO SAY THAT IF IT ENTITY DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A COVERED ENTITY OR BUSINESS ASSOCIATE WHICH I ASSUME IS A CONTRACT PHARMACY. THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH HIPPA RULES. SO AND- YEAH. THAT THAT'S THE HIP FLASK. THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN THREE FORTY B. WELL THAT'S THE HIPAA PRIVACY LAW. NO I I'M FAMILIAR WITH WITH HIP- BUT I'M I'M TALKING IN TERMS AND CONTEXT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE- SEE MY CONCERN AND THE WAY I MAY BE A MIS READ IT BUT IT SAYS HERE THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER FROM IMPOSING ANY REQUIREMENT CONDITIONS. OR EXCLUSIONS THAT DISCRIMINATE GET DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A. C. E. OR A SPECIFIED PHARMACY IN CONNECTION WITH DISPENSING COVER DRUGS SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE SPECIFIED. PHARMACY IS THE- THE BUSINESS- ASSOCIATE THAT IS COVERED UNDER COVERED ENTITIES OR IS IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I THINK IT SAID THEY WERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CONTRACT PHARMACY WITH THE- COVERED ENTITY OKAY. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ALSO ON THE BILL IT GOES ON TO DEFINE A SPECIFIED PHARMACY AS WELL SO. I WANTED TO GET MORE MORE CLARITY ON THAT AND I THINK THAT- ON MY FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I THINK THERE'S A- THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF. LOOK WE JUST HEARD EARLIER TODAY AND THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE EIGHT EIGHT SENTINEL- EPIDEMIC WE HAVE. AN OPIOID CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES AND- WE HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S- BAD ACTORS OUT THERE NOTHING THAT ANYONE IN THIS. IS- BUT I YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO DISPENSING OP ED YOU NOTE DRUGS AND MY CONCERN IS THAT. ALONG THIS WAY IN THIS PATH THAT WE ARE POTENTIALLY. EXPOSING MORE INDIVIDUALS IN IT TO ACCESS. DRUGS THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE ACCESSING THAT WILL HAVE BAD ACTORS- BECAUSE IT I'M ASSUMING THAT THERE'S ALREADY BAD ACTORS AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALREADY AN EFFORT. AN AUDIT THAT. TAKES INTO ACCOUNT AND REMOVE THOSE BAD ACTORS FROM THE PROCESS. SO I I'M CONCERNED THAT IF EXPANDED- THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL HAVE THAT THERE BE LESS ACCOUNTABILITY SO I JUST WANTED TO OPT. EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS TODAY AND CAN COMMITTEE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WILL BE DOING MORE HOMEWORK AND RESEARCH ON THIS BECAUSE I JUST I DUG IN AND I FOUND IT INTERESTING AND SO- AND IF I MAY ASK TO THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAD A CONTRACT FORM A CONTRACT PHARMACIES THAT YOU WORK WITH. THAT LIKE HOW MANY AND ARE ANY OF THOSE OUT OF STATE. YEAH I KNOW NONE OF THEM ARE OUT OF STATE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU AN INCORRECT ANSWER ON HOW MANY WE HAVE BECAUSE I. AM NOT FIRMLY AWARE WE HAVE FIVE CLINICS ACROSS LA COUNTY. AND SO I KNOW WE CONTRACT WITH AT LEAST FIVE CONTRACT PHARMACIES WHERE PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICATION BUT I COULD GET BACK TO YOU WITH A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT- CERTAINLY NONE OF THEM ARE OUT OF STATE THEY'RE ALL. CLOSE TO THE CLINIC WHERE WE PROVIDE SERVICES OKAY AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CLARIFY THE STATEMENT ABOUT OUT OF STATE EXACTLY WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT SO FOR EXAMPLE IS IF YOU'RE KIND OF A CONTRACT WITH WALGREENS BECAUSE HAPPENS WALGREENS HAS A LOT OF PHARMACIES AND YOUR- DATE ARE SERVING THE AREA TRYING TO SERVE. THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OUT OF STATE BUT THE REASON YOU'RE DOING IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT PHARMACIES THAT ARE IN THE AREA WHICH YOU'RE SERVING IN THE NAVY YOU KNOW. I HAVE HERE IS MY DISTRICT ARE LOW INCOME AND WE DO HAVE SOME COMMERCIAL THEY'LL PHARMACIES RITE AIDS WALGREENS OF WHAT. IT TURNED OUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT PEOPLE GO TO BECAUSE THEY'RE WONDERFUL REST CONVENIENCE SO. ERIC CLINIC MAY CHOOSE TO THEREFORE. HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM TO MAKE THE MEDICATIONS MORE ACCEPTABLE. TO THOSE PATIENTS THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THEN I GUESS JUST THE LAST QUESTION AND I. PROMISE THIS IS THE LAST ONE. I WONDER IF- SO. AS PART OF THE DEAF THE DEFINITION OF. THE BILL IT SAYS INTERFERE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL'S CHOICE RECEIVE A COVER DRUG FROM C. E. OR SPECIFIED PHARMACY. WHETHER PERSON OR VIA DIRECTLY DELIVERY MAIL OR OTHER FORM OF. SHIPMENT AND WE CAN YOU JUST. ELABORATE AS TO. AT THAT THAT COMPONENT OF THE BILL. YES SIR NICOLE HAD SPOKEN TO THIS ISSUE SO PBMS CAN IMPLEMENT MAIL ORDER REQUIREMENTS SO ESSENTIALLY INSTEAD OF PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO PICK UP MEDICATION FROM- COMMUNITY OR RETAIL PHARMACY THEY'RE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE THOSE MEDICATIONS THROUGH MAIL ORDER SO SOME OF THE EXAMPLES NICOLE MENTIONED WERE PEOPLE WITH HIV PEOPLE TAKING HIV PREVENTION MEDICATIONS. TRANSPOSED WHO WOULD HAVE SENSITIVITY ISSUES ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR MEDICATIONS IN THE MAIL SO THE BILLS INTENDED TO PREVENT THOSE MANDATORY MAIL ORDER REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS CAN PICK UP THEIR MEDICATION IN PERSON IF THEY NEED TO. THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SENATOR WIENER HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART AND HAS. THAT'S TO SAY. I DID I'M A I'M A CO AUTHOR I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING- NO I JUST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR LEADING ON THIS AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND THE REASON I CALLED IT IT IS- THROUGH THREE FORTY P. PROGRAM IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND- IT'S A LIFELINE FOR- SO MANY- COMMUNITY CLINICS AND CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE AND THESE ARE. THE CLINICS THAT PROVIDE- OFTEN HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY HAVE- OTHER OPTIONS- BECAUSE OUR FRONTLINE COMMUNITY CLINICS OR IN DIRECTLY IN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT- THAT THAT KNOW HOW TO REACH INTO THESE COMMUNITIES AND CONNECT PEOPLE TO CARE- AND THESE ARE LIKE APL- YOUR- THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION- PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND- THESE ARE CLINICS THAT WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND THREE FORTY B. AS- ESSENTIAL. FOR THEM TO NOT TO SURVIVE BUT TO BE STRONG AND TO SAVE LIVES IN A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST- AT PROVIDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE- TO SERVICE SOME OF THE MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES SOME A STRONG. SUPPORTER OF THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM- WELL I WAS WITH AND PROGRAM A SPECIAL A BIG NATIONAL PROGRAM. IF THERE BUT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE PERFECT AND WILL THERE BE ABUSES YES- AND SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO. YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS BENEFITING THE- THE ORGANIZATION THE CLINIC SO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BENEFITING. CHRIS AND AS I SAID TO THE OPPONENTS IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW. RIDICULOUS ABUSES YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET- I NOTE THE AUTHOR IT ALWAYS HAS AN OPEN DOOR TO IF THERE IF THERE WERE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT- BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER AND I'M CONCERNED THAT. SOME OF THESE ARE PRACTICES- HOW ABOUT A FACT THAT ARE GOING TO BE HARMFUL TO OUR COMMUNITY CLINICS- THAT'S ONE QUARTER IN THE BUILD AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S GONNA MOTION BUT SOMEONE THAT OKAY WELL I WILL MAKE A MOTION ABOUT NOTHING ANYBODY ON THIS SIDE OF THE- COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM OR SOMETHING. NO OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK- WE'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT OF TESTIMONY TODAY NOT ONLY FROM WITNESS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO. DOCTORS CAN WE HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

TO COME UP WITH OPTIONS TO REDUCE COST SHARING PLANS AVAILABLE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. THE BILL WOULD HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE COST SHARING WITH THE MOST GENEROUS. APPLICATION TO LOWER LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS I AM WORKING WITH US SIMPLY CHAIR- HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR WOULD WHO HAS A MERE VISIT VERSION OF THIS BILL- THIS BILL IS ABOUT- MAKING COVERED CALIFORNIA MORE AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE WORKED ON VERY HARD HERE IN THE SENATE OVER TIME. IN EFFECT THE FACT THAT IS THAT COVERED CALIFORNIA'S PREMIUMS IN FACT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN. THE INCREASES SEVEN UNDER PERCENT FOR TWO COUPLE YEARS I THINK THIS YEAR TO AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER HERE IN HE SENATE SO WE I CONTINUE THAT WORK ON THE LINES- I'M PLEASED TO HAV SPONSORING. WHO HAD SPONSORED THE BILL DIANA DOUGLAS WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA AND BIANCA BLOOM QUEST WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- WE WILL GO TO LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- MADAME MODERATOR CAN YOU SEE IF DIANA DOUGLAS IS ON THE LINE PLEASE. ALL RIGHT OPEN. DIANA PLEASE GO AHEAD YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DIANA DOUGLAS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. YOUR PROBLEM SPONSORS OF SB NINE FORTY FOUR WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF COST SHARING FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES. A SIGNIFICANT PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY FIRST THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER HAVE BEEN ROLLED IN OUR COVERAGE FOR YOUR MARKET PLACE. HOWEVER EVEN WITH COVERAGE BRIGHTENS DOUBLED AND COPAYS KEEP CARE OUT OF REACH FOR MANY 60% OF CALIFORNIANS REPORT FEELING WORRIED ABOUT OUT OF POCKET COSTS USING HEALTH INSURANCE. A GREATER PERCENTAGE THAN THOSE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF HOUSING UTILITIES OR GROCERIES THIS IS UNSURPRISING GIVEN DEDUCTIBLES OFTEN ABOUT SEVERAL MONTHS OF WEIGHT. PERSON IN A STANDARD CLOVER PLAN MAKING JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND PER MONTH MIGHT HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED THE AMOUNT THAT WILL RISE TO OVER FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED BY NEXT YEAR. THEY'LL BE PAYING A FORTY FIVE DOLLAR COPAY TO SEE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT FROM LANCASTER. ESPECIALLY I PRACTICAL. LESS THAN HALF OF ALL HEALTH. DIPPING OR DELAYING FOUR WILL ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES AND SILVER PLANS. AND IT WILL OPERATE ALL OVER PANAMA LEAKS AND MORE AFFORDABLE HERE'S THE COST SHARING. THE BILL ALSO EXTEND CRUSHER AND HELP TO THOSE IN THE MIDDLE INCOME RANGE EARNING UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THEY'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES WILL BE EXPANDED LATER THIS YEAR WHICH GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS. THANK YOU SOMEBODY FROM TAKING CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. THE OUTLOOK FORTY CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE HEALTH PLANS AND RESOLVE ANY OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE. ON SB NINE FOUR AM RESPECTFUL ASK IPHONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION MIGHT MATTER MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP BIANCA BLOM QUESTLINE PLEASE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN GO AHEAD BIANCA WELCOME. NINE YEARS THANKS TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING SMALL BUSINESS AFTER ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN PUT IT BACK IN NINE FORTY FOUR I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED FOR THAT AND THAT INCLUDES THE PORTABILITY BUT HONDA THOUSANDS OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME ON NORTH AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE ARE OVER FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP 99% OF TOTAL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN HALF OF ALL ENROLLEES NATIONWIDE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES MORE THOUGHT THEM WAIT INDIVIDUAL. RECENT FEDERAL ASKING TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND HELP FORMULA AND IN THE DAY THAT THEY CAN TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE HINDERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN OUR STATE THE NEED FOR AFFORDABILITY AMONG CALIFORNIA ON THE NORTHEAST GROUNDS. KEEPING IN MIND SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA DEPEND ON GOD PROVIDED BY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THE FORTY FOUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT MORE THAN ONE IN THREE SMALL BUSINESSES REPORT THAT IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE BECAUSE CAN HELP INSURANCE COVERAGE THEMSELVES AND THEIR-EMPLOYEES DURING THE CAMPAIGN. FOR BROADBAND REPORTED BASEMENT BATTERING REDUCING HEALTHCARE COVERAGE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES OPEN ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO INDICATE MAKING THIS CHANGE STRONG AFFORDABLE MARKETPLACE THE CENTRAL FOR A FUTURE CALIFORNIA NINE NORTH. I THINK I. FORTY FOR THE CENTRAL PARK NETWORK BECAUSE THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WITH EMPLOYEES AND JUST OVER THE COPPER HEALTHCARE SUBSIDIES WHICH IS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT I RESET OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 70% OF THOSE POLLED BY EXPANDING OFFERINGS THAT MEET THE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE UP 26100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARSBECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS MORE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA MUST BEGIN TO ADDRESS ESCALATING COSTS DURING THE NINE FORTY FOUR DOES A PRETTY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT EQUIPPED YET AND WE MUST ACT IN A STRONG RECOVERY FROM THE CAMP AND I. ORDERED THE PORK AT NINE FORTY FOUR FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS THANK YOU.

FOR YOUR SECOND SUCCESS OF THE DAY WILL MOVE NOW TO THE FINAL BILL OF THE DAY ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN WHICH IS S. B. ONE TWO THREE FOUR CENTER PANTS THANK YOU ADAM VICE CHAIR- SENATORS SP ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWELVE THIRTY FOUR REQUIRES THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM TO COVER SIXTY TRANSMIT INFECTION SCREENING AND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR VISITING THE PROVIDER. UNTREATED STIS CAN HAVE SERIOUS LONG TERM EFFECTS INCLUDING INFERTILITY BLINDNESS CERVICAL CANCER AND NEGATIVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A STANDALONE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED PEOPLE TO ACCESS STI CARE AND WHAT FAMILY PACKAGE COVERS STI SERVICES IS ONLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FAMILY PLANNING VISIT PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AT RISK FOR EXPERIENCING CAUSING UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR FAMILY PRACTICE SERVICES. VALUE PACK PROGRAM HAS A NETWORK OF MORE TWO THOUSAND COUNTRY CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROVIDERS BUT WE'LL TRY TRAINED TO DELIVER STI SERVICES MAXIMIZING EXISTING PROGRAM LIKE FAMILY PACK OFFERS A PATHWAY FOR EQUITABLE STI COVERAGE COMPARED TO CREATE A BRAND NEW PROGRAM CHECK THE SCOPE OF THE TI THE STI EPIDEMIC REQUIRES ACTION NOW THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS EXASPERATED RATES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CRISIS LEVELS. THAT'S THE ONE TWO THREE FOUR AIMS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO STI PREVENTION AND TREATMENT FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED PATIENTS THROUGH FAMILY PACKED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ARTIST AND WE HAVE THE AND SUPPORT- TAMMY MARTIN FROM EQUALITY CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS SHOP IS. A FORMER- FAMILY PACK PATIENT. WHEN THANK YOU SO P. WE WILL GO TO A LEEWAY. A SUPPORT MODERATE IF YOU CAN PLEASE SEE IF TAMMY MARTIN IS ON THE LINE. THE WIDE OPEN. GO AHEAD TELL ME GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS TOMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE ONE OF THE PRAGUE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND WE JOINED THIS EFFORT BECAUSE THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY- EXPERIENCES SEVERE NEGATIVE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING WEST ACTUALLY IRATE. AND B. ANALYSIS LEAVES OUT THE MANY REASONS FOR THESE DISPARITIES REASONS THAT OFTEN IMPEDE ACCESS AND CREATE CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS FOR LGBTQ PLUS PATIENTS USE AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA HE CONTROL BRANCH REPORTS THAT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF REPORTED. MAIL GONORRHEA CASES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL S. T. I THINK CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCED BY YOU BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR. SO WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED ACTUALLY IRATE AND LONGSTANDING HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN EXPANDING HEALTHCARE ACCESS BUT WE NEED TO CLOSE REMAINING COVERAGE GAPS THAT ARE DRIVING SD I READ AND- DISPARITIES. IN A DOCTOR CAN MENTION BECAUSE THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM CANNOT SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AT RISK OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. THIS LEAVES MANY LOW INCOME LGBTQ PLUS CALIFORNIANS WITH NO OTHER PATHWAY TO FREE STI COVERAGE. I WILL HEAR AN LGBTQ PLUS PERSON MIGHT BE GRANTED ACCESS TO THIS COVERAGE ONE DAY AND BE DENIED ACCESS JUST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN HARMFUL LAPSES IN CARE SO THIS UNFAIR STRUCTURAL INEQUITY REQUIRES AN UPDATE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE FINANCIAL HI SENSITIVE SERVICES.
