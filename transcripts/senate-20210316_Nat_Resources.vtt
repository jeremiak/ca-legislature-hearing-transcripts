LIKE SAN PEDRO AND LONG BEACH

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.532
SINCE THE WALLS WILL FURTHER

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.100
REDUCE ACCESS TO COASTAL

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.535
HAVE THE ABILITY- TO WEIGH IN

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.171
AND FRANKLY- THE LOCAL COASTAL

00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:00.939
PLANS ALREADY ADDRESS A NUMBER

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.407
OF THESE ISSUES THE REAL FOCUS

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.209
OF THIS BILL. IS BRING IN OTHER

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.545
ENTITIES ON BOARD TO WORK WITH

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.046
THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND NOT

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:10.115
JUST THE E. P. A. AS I STATED

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:11.950
IN MY THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:15.687
EPA AGENCIES BUT TRANSPORTATION

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:18.523
AND ON OTHERS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.025
TO BROADEN THE PERSPECTIVE OF

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.992
WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S IMPACT

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:24.229
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO I

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.697
THINK WE'RE ALWAYS HEALTHY TO

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:28.433
BE SKEPTICL OF HOW ANY AGENCY

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.669
WORKS AND ALL OF US WHETHER WE

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.103
SUPPORTED AGENCY OR NOT IN

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.406
PHILOSOPHY OR PRINCIPLE HAVE

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.407
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:36.575
SURE. THAT IT'S STAND

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.876
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE IN

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:40.011
THE PUBLIC AND THE COASTAL

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.146
COMMISSION AS HAD THE HISTORIC

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.547
DESIGNATION OF HAVING TO

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.516
PROTECT THE COASTLINE WHICH HAS

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:47.786
BEEN NO SMALL FEAT- SO I AM NOT

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:50.255
BUT I BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.189
YOU'RE COMING FROM AND I THINK

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:52.858
IT WILL BE UP AND COMING UP ON

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:56.628
ALL OF US TO HAVE. THAT

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:57.729
COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU.

00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:02.567
FATHER KIRK. MISTER WEISS.

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:04.970
BERRYHILL FIRST OF ALL I WANNA

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:07.806
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:08.573
THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.109
FORWARD I STARTED WORKING WITH

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.511
THE COASTAL COMMISSION BACK IN

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:14.946
TWO THOUSAND. NINE

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.282
APPROXIMATELY ON THIS ISSUE- ON

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.150
ON A PLANNING STRATEGY ON HOW

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:20.919
TO COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE AND

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.555
IT'S BEEN. I DON'T QUITE A TIME

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:25.257
OF WORK SO I THINK IT'S

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:27.692
ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. TO

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:29.194
CARRY ON AND CARRY FORWARD WITH

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.862
THAT WITH THE MEASURE SUCH AS

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:31.897
THIS AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD

00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:33.832
ON. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.534
THAT OFTEN IS NOT CONSIDERED.

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.470
IN THIS IN THIS CONVERSATION IS

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:40.972
HOW MUCH. OF WATER THAT

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.574
NATURALLY AND USED YOU KNOW

00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:44.142
NATURALLY JUST OVER THE YEARS

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:46.478
HAS BEEN SEQUESTERED IN INOWROC

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.847
OFFERS AND ARE THE STATE OF

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:51.316
CALIFORNIA HOW ARE ARE. THE

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.318
STATE'S RESERVES OF WATER KNOCK

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:55.153
FIRST HAS BEEN GREATLY DEPLETED

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.223
WHERE WOULD SOME AREAS WE'VE

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.992
SEEN THIRTY FIVE FEET OF. FIRST

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.395
AND THAT ALSO IS PART OF THE

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:06.398
EQUATION OF- OF MAKING SURE

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:07.933
THAT I MEAN NOT ONLY DOES THAT

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.334
WATER SERVE THE PURPOSES OF

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.269
AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN USE BUT

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:13.772
IT ALSO HELPS TO COMBAT CIVIL

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.474
SEALEVEL RISE SO WHEREVER WE

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:18.610
CAN- YOU KNOW PUT SOME

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.111
RESOURCES INTO RESTORING

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:21.780
ESTABLISHING THAT ALSO. PART OF

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.214
THE STRATEGY I THINK THAT

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:25.216
SHOULD BE LOOKED AT THAT. AS

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:26.785
MUCH AS POSSIBLE I'VE AS MANY

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.219
OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:28.987
VERY HARD TO RESTORING THE

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.523
SALTON SEA AND WE'VE SEEN THAT-

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:36.661
THAT LAKE GO BACK- IN. IT IN A

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.330
SEA LEVEL IT ITS OWN LEVEL HAS

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:40.498
BEEN GREATLY DEPLETED AND IF WE

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.367
USE THAT ALSO AS A STORAGE

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.169
WATER COULD HELP. THE

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:46.237
ENVIRONMENT AND- IN FIFTY

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:47.105
DIFFERENT WAYS TO REVENUE

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:49.941
MANAGER HERE FOR THE LAST TEN

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:52.243
YEARS. BUT THAT ALSO CAN HELP

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.412
COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE NETWORK

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:57.148
WHERE WE LOOK AT ANY- LAKES.

00:26:57.215 --> 00:27:00.652
WITH NATURAL LAKES RESERVOIRS.

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:04.089
AQUIFER'S ALL THAT SHOULD BE

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:06.091
INCLUDED AS PART THE STRATEGY-

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:08.560
IN AND ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT IN

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:09.894
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:12.564
WE HAVE HAVE THE DEAD SEA THE-

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.100
OVERALL SEE ACROSS THE WORLD WE

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:19.437
SEE. AN ENORMOUS- EMPTYING OF

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:22.107
AQUIFER'S AND WATER BODIES THAT

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.542
USED TO ONCE BE VIBRANT BODIES

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.611
ARE NOW COMPLETELY DECIMATED

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.713
BECAUSE OF HUMAN USE NOT HAS TO

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.815
BE PART OF PART OF CALIFORNIANS

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:33.385
ADVOCACY CROSS TO WORLD CHEN

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.020
COURAGE THAT THANK YOU. OF

ENORMOUS WORK IN YOUR COUNTRY

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.057
YOUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:41.126
COASTLINE THIS IS A WONDERFUL

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:44.796
BILL AND I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED.

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:45.296
AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.632
POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. FURTHER

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.736
OUR COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONS. IN

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.772
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.573
COMMENTS THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.976
BILLS OTHER THAN OF COURSE MY

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.278
OWN. I FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT IT

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.547
IT IS HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE.

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:03.915
IT IS FORTY YEARS AGO THIS

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.216
NOVEMBER THAT I WAS FIRST

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.385
ELECTED TO CITY OFFICE AND THE

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.354
FIRST TWO YEARS OF A COASTAL

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.122
TOWN WE HAD A PRESIDENTIALLY

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:14.125
DECLARED DISASTER FOR EROSION.

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:16.795
AND WE HAD A ROUGH TIME AND THE

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.265
STATE AT THE TIME REQUIRED. A

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:22.967
MAJOR BEACH AREA IN OUR CITY

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.602
AND IT WAS UP TO THE CITY TO

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.805
PASS THE DESIGN AND WE DID

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:28.940
SOMETHING THAT ALIENATED A KEY

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.275
CONSTITUENCY GROUP IN SANTA

00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:33.011
CRUZ OF THE SURFERS BECAUSE WE

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.913
WANTED THE ROAD TO BE A HUNDRED

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:36.548
AND FIFTY FEET BACK. WE ENDED

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:38.149
UP DOING IT AND THEN THE FORTY

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.284
YEARS SINCE THEN NOW THERE'S

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.186
BEEN SIGNIFICANT EROSION. IN

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:44.722
SOME OF THE PLACES EXACTLY. AS

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:48.093
WE PREDICTED AND THEN WHEN I

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.395
WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.429
200-022-2000 EIGHT THERE WERE

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:52.831
JUST TWO OF US IN ENTIRE SIX

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:54.666
YEARS TO DO THE BILL IN ANY WAY

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.367
ON SEA LEVEL RISE AND IT WAS

00:28:56.434 --> 00:29:00.071
DESIGNED. OF THE BILL THAT DIED

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:02.040
IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME WAS

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:05.143
DESIGNED TO ASK LOCAL

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.945
JURISDICTIONS TO PLANNED FOR

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.613
SEA LEVEL RISE AND HALF THE

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.482
CONSTITUENCY GROUP SAID. WE

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.684
WON'T SUPPORT IT UNLESS THERE'S

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.119
A BASELINE IN THE BILL AND THE

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:16.521
OTHER HALF SAID WHAT SUPPORT IF

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.122
THERE IS A BASS LINE AND THE

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:20.658
BILL. SO THAT IS WHAT KILLED

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:21.159
THE BILL AND THEN LO AND

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.094
BEHOLD. I END UP BEING

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.662
RESOURCES SECRETARY IN CHARGE

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:26.131
OF THE SCIENCE THAT ACTUALLY

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:27.966
PROVIDED THE BASELINE FOR

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:33.505
PLANNING. AND. THE SCIENCE WE

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.573
APPROVED. ON THE DAY. THAT AND

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.341
FOR THE- OCEAN PROTECT COUNCIL

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.709
WHICH NINE TO BILL ON THE DAY

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:42.180
THE SUIT. HIT FROM. JAPAN AND

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.849
IT REALLY. DESTROYED TWO

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.985
HARBORS IN CALIFORNIA ONE WAS

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:49.087
IN MY DISTRICT AND THIS WAS

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:50.989
WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT BEFORE

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.659
SEALEVEL RISE. AND AS I SAID AT

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.995
THE TIME C. AUTHORIZES NOT LIKE

00:29:57.061 --> 00:30:00.131
A BATHTUB SLOWLY FILLING UP. IT

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.633
IS ACTUALLY THE EXTREME OF THAT

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:02.867
IT IS THE TWO YEAR OLD CANNON

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.936
BALLING INTO THE BATH TUB AND

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:06.404
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.306
WITH THAT TSUNAMI AND THAT'S

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.807
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE TO PLAN

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:12.177
FOR. AND WE DID GUIDANCE TO

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.144
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BASED ON THE

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.713
SCIENCE WE FUNDED UPDATES AND

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.315
LOCAL COASTAL PLAN SO THAT

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.117
PEOPLE COULD START TO PLAN FOR

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.787
SEA LEVEL RISE. AND AS SENATOR

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.923
EGGMAN SAID. THE BETWEEN A TEN

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.292
YEAR FLOOD IN THE DELTA. AND A

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.526
HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD IN THE DELTA

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.662
IS ONE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:33.097
SO THIS IS NOT JUST A COASTAL

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:35.733
ISSUE. AND SO THE QUESTION IS

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.534
AS THERE'S BEEN THIS

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.436
PROGRESSION IN THE SCIENCE AND

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:39.504
IN THE PLANNING WHAT ARE THE

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.206
NEXT STEPS WHAT THE NEXT STEPS

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:43.508
ARE THIS BILL. IT REALLY SETS

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.376
IT UP IT SAYS THAT WE REALLY

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.844
HAVE TO COLLABORATE UP AND DOWN

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.079
THE COAST BECAUSE IT INVOLVES

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.113
EVERY BRANCH OF LOCAL

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.815
GOVERNMENT. IT INVOLVES ALL

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:52.450
THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.118
AND THIS BILL SETS THE

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.254
FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING AHEAD AND

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.323
MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND SO.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:59.490
I'M GOING TO BE PROUD TO

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.692
SUPPORT IT I HOPE AT THE

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.227
APPROPRIATE TIME I COULD BE A

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:05.363
CO AUTHOR. AND I ALSO NOTED FOR

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.898
THE RECORD THAT- YOU HAVE

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.766
AGREED TO ADD SENATOR STERN AS

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.603
A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. YES AND

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.404
IF YES MISTER CHAIRMAN OF

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.206
COURSE AND ALSO I'M AWARE THAT

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:16.941
US SENATOR HERTZBERG WOULD LIKE

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:15.163
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THE

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.064
MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WE

CHANGE PERMIT FROM CAL JIM IS

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.387

WAS ABANDONED BY A PRIOR

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.396
OPERATOR AND TO OPERATE THAT

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.231
LEASE- WELL AND WITHIN THE

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:23.865

OPERATOR- I'M ENGAGED IN THAT

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.650
PROCESS NOW BECAUSE NOW THE-

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.952
THE LAWFUL LEGAL OPERATOR THAT

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.420
WOULD DO A GREAT JOB OPERATING

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:47.022
THESE WELLS WERE ABANDONED. IS

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.857
THROWING HIS HANDS UP AND GONE

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:49.424
LOOK I GET WITH THIS FOR TWO

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:51.359
YEARS I'M DONE- SO IT IS VERY

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.228
FRUSTRATING SO THE SOLUTION IS

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:54.396
TO FIX WHAT'S GOING ON AT CAL

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:57.365

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:59.234

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.217
BIT FORWARD TO WHERE RESOURCES

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.718
WILL GO BACK TO KERN COUNTY.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.286
AND OPERATORS COULD BE PAID

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.288
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T GET THE

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.557
PART THE PERMITS. FROM CAL JIM

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:23.291

FLOOR. I DIDN'T COME BACK TO

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.508
SIMPLER BUT I WOULD HAVE VOTED

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:42.077
NO. AND BECAUSE IT DID IT JUST

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.512
FURTHER EXACERBATED THE

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:48.316

SITUATION THAT WE HAVE. AND IF

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.594
THE GOAL WHICH I THINK IS A

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.062
GOOD GOAL IS TO SHUT DOWN THESE

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.098
IDLE WELLS OR HAVE GOOD

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:04.933

WELLS AND SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.357

ADJUST FOR THE WHAT THEY FIND

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.413
IN THE GROUND. AND SO ON I'M

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.882
RELYING ON INDUSTRY H<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; TRUST&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:08.650
IN THERE THAT SAYS IT'S GOING

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.685
TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. WHAT

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:11.486
ABOUT THIS EXACERBATES THE

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.621
PROBLEM. WHAT A PARTICULAR

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:14.489
ABOUT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.524
PROBLEM. SO THAT THE PREVIOUS

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.026
BILL IS WHAT IS SHE WAS WHEN

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.160

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:21.296
ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND WHAT ABOUT

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.597
THIS ONE PROCESS OF THIS BILL

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.132
IN THE PROCESS DOESN'T. BUT

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:25.467
WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.301
ANTICIPATE THIS WILL TAKE ON

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.002
THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. WHEN SHE

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:28.570
GIVES A WORD THAT SHE'S NOT

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.404
WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE A

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.705

WHAT IT MIGHT TURN INTO LATER.

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:41.316
YES WORD THE SAME ISSUE THAT WE

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.585
FACE THE OPPOSITION BASED. IS

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:45.253
IT SHE TOOK AMENDMENTS THE

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.956
AUTHOR TOOK AMENDMENTS. AFTER

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:50.158

OPPOSITION- WHICH WAS CLEARLY

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:59.534

THIS BILL AS IS. EVEN WITH THE

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:07.342

CONVERSATION THAT IS TAKING

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:52.680
PLACE I DO SOME WORK AROUND

THIS PIECE AND I THINK I WANT.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:26:00.655
THAT RECOGNIZE THAT AT. THE

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.289
CENTER FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.657
MENTIONED THE PROBLEM IS NOT

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.492
JUST ON THE COAST ALTHOUGH I

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.127
REPRESENT THE COAST AND WE HAVE

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:07.328
A NUMBER OF THE BAND DIDN'T

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:08.997
WORK AND WELLS I'M IN THE

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:10.565
DISTRICTI REPRESENT TO AYE

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.468
ABSOLUTELY IT IS NOT LIMITED OR

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.637
RESTRICTED TO A PROBLEM ON THE

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:16.571
COAST SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:19.007
THAT. I WAS PREPARED TO ALSO

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.276
LAY OFF FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.978
BUT WITH THE AUTHORS THAT SHE

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:26.848
WILL BE. AMENDMENT I WILL BE

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:30.618
SUPPORTING IT I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:31.419
LOOKING AT AMENDMENTS LIKE. BUT

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:35.089
I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I MYSELF

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:37.892
SOMETIMES AT IN OPPOSITE

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:39.394
PERSPECTIVE AS SOME OF MY

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.229
COLLEAGUES TO BUY TALK TO EIGHT

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:42.797
DO YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT I

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:45.600
THINK I'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES OF

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.570
THIS PERSPECTIVE I'M SURE THERE

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.805
ONE THAT THE IMPACT OF IDLE AND

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.607
ABANDONED AND ORPHANED WELLS I

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:55.343
HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.580
AND TO THAT WE AGREE THAT THERE

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:01.316
IS- A BACKLOG. ADD TO ASK HOW

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.585
CHEN AND SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.053
THOSE TWO POINTS I THINK WE

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.688
OFTEN FIND OURSELVES AT

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:09.757
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE-

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.259
AND THE PERSPECTIVE I DON'T

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.393
THINK THAT THIS IS A PARTISAN

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:13.294
ISSUE I THINK IT'S A

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.063
PERSPECTIVE- IT'S A LIVED

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:17.065
EXPERIENCE FOR ME- OF THE

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.766
DISTRICT I REPRESENT AS I KNOW

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:21.235
IT IS FOR COLLEAGUES I'M IN AND

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.570
THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT I AM

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:23.504
GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.273
BILL- AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.308
ALSO REMEMBER. THE TWO THINGS

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.377
WE FOUND IN COMMON TODAY- THAT

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:30.812
THERE IS AN IMPACT TO HEALTH

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.380
AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE BAND IN

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:34.215
AN ORPHAN WELLS THAT ARE NOT

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.417
READY TO PROPERLY- AND ALSO

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:39.220
THAT WE WANT TO DO MORE TO

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:42.190
ALLOW CALTRAIN. TO TACKLE THIS

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.025
PROBLEM AND NOT SEE THE BACKLOG

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:49.030
THAT WE HAVE SEEN. SO I WILL BE

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:49.597
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY.

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.498
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAN BE WE

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:51.899
WILL GO TO A CLUB OUR TO MAKE A

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:54.268
COMMENT AND THAT IS IT. WHEN

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.571
CENTER GROVE SLIPPED AND USED

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:58.139
TO WORK DOGGART IT WAS DELAYED

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:01.075
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS FOR ME.

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:03.144
BECAUSE I SUPERVISED ORDER FOR

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:06.848
EIGHT YEARS. AND THE- THE ISSUE

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.416
THAT SENATOR LA MON JUST

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:12.387
OUTLINED SWELL IS PROFOUND IF-

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.922
WE HAD ABANDONED AND ORPHANED

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.290
WELLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:17.725
MONUMENTAL COST TO THE

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:20.261
TAXPAYERS. IN ADDITION TO THE

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:22.296
ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT THAT COMES

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.465
FROM THEM AND SO I SALUTE

01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:26.000
SENATOR HER TADO FOR TAKING

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.735
THIS ON AND I THINK. THE

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:28.803
AMENDMENTS MAKE THIS BILL

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.371
BETTER WE WILL ALL BE LOOKING

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.540
AT IT AS IT MOVES ALONG TO MAKE

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:33.408
SURE THAT ADDRESSES THOSE

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.309
ISSUES. AND TO SENATOR GROVE

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:37.311
LET ME JUST TELL YOU. ONE OF

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:39.480
THE MOST AMUSING MOMENTS FOR ME

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:40.281
DURING MY TIME IN THE STATE

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:42.383
ASSEMBLY. WAS WHEN THEN

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.686
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:47.955
STOOD UP. AND AUTHORED A BILL

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:51.092
TO RAISE FEES IN THIS AREA. AND

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.761
IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS SLOWER

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:55.730
REGULATION THE INDUSTRY PAID

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:56.764
THE FEES WHEN THEY PAID THE

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.900
FEES IT WOULD MOVE THE PROCESS

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:00.535
ALONG. BUT I ASKED HIM IF HE

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.303
WOULD YIELD FOR A QUESTION AND

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.571
ASK THEM IF THIS WAS THE FIRST

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:05.073
OF MANY FEE BILLS THAT HE WAS

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.674
GOING TO PUT ON THE FLOOR OF

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.010
THE ASSEMBLY CAN. HE BLUSHED IT

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.045
DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER BUT IT

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.448
WAS BECAUSE OF THIS PRECISE

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.550
ISSUE THAT HE HAD TO MOVE ALONG

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:17.151
TO FEES TO MOVE ALONG TO

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:18.519
REGULATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.221
IT. THAT IT HAPPENED AND I

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.889
THINK IT HAS TO BE NOTED THAT

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:24.125
IT IS THE INDUSTRY. THAT PAYS

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.360
FOR THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.362
IF THEY DON'T PAY ENOUGH THEY

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:29.163
DON'T GET THE REGULATORY

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:31.733
PROCESS TO BE ALLOWED TO DO IT

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.134
AND SO ALL THOSE THINGS ARE

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.102
GOING TO BE WRAPPED UP IN THIS

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:36.704
BILL AND THAT'S WHY. I SAID THE

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:38.439
CENTER FOR BE WILLING TO TAKE

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.475

FORESTRY IS ALREADY RECEIVING A

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.579

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:05.279
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY'RE

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.981

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:16.757
THE IS THE INTEREST IN THE

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:19.359

THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE IS

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.934
WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SO NEW BOND

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.403
MONEY IS GREAT BUT IT'S-

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:31.271

THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:42.349
CONTINUAL FUNDING. AND IT'S NOT

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.084
A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT IT

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:45.552
IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:43:45.619 --> 01:43:47.020
BE DEPENDED ON TO MAKE THE

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:48.355
COMMITMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:49.756
BECAUSE- IT'S NOT JUST PLANTING

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:51.224
THE TREE IT'S GIVING THEM MONEY

01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:52.859
SO THAT THEY CAN. CONTINUE THE

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:53.560
MAINTENANCE OF THE TREE FOR A

01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:56.563

HAPPENING- THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:02.008
TRAVELING A MILE OR MORE AND IF

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.050
IS GOOD BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.652

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:16.990
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:17.790

EDUCATION AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:47.253

FLAMMABILITY OF THE HOME ITSELF

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:52.091
WHICH IS WHY HOMES BURNED.

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:52.692

THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT SO. WE

02:01:58.077 --> 02:01:59.779
HEARD THIS- THE PRO TEM BUILD

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:01.447
ON OUR SEA LEVEL RISE THIS

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:05.651
REALLY TO THE- NINE. DON'T HAVE

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:07.286
TO THE POINT ABOUT TIME THE

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.721
THREAT THAT THIS ARE BOTH TO

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.423
PEOPLE PROPERTIES AND OF COURSE

02:02:10.489 --> 02:02:13.159
THE FINANCIAL THREAT- THE

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:14.727
ESTIMATES ARE THAT MORE THAN A

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:15.795
HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:16.962
WORTH OF PROPERTY COULD BE AT

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:20.833
RISK OF FLOODING BY TWENTY BY.

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.834
TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. AND SO

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:23.569
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ESTIMATE

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:25.237
STATEWIDE. SO ONE OF THE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:26.172
CHALLENGES ONE OF THE MANY

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:27.773
CHALLENGES OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.108
IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:31.677
ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WITH

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:32.878
WITH ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS.

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:33.879
THEY'RE TRYING TO BALANCE A

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:36.382
VERY LIMITED BUDGETS AND VERY

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:37.016
FEW GOOD OPTIONS WITH THE NEEDS

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:39.852
OF HOMEOWNERS. AND CLEAN AREAS

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.654
ALREADY EXPERIENCING FLOODING

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:43.255
BUYING OUT LOCAL RESIDENTS AND

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:44.290
RELOCATING THEM IS VERY VERY

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:46.092
CONTROVERSIAL AND IN SOME CASES

02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:48.027
YOU KNOW COST PROHIBITIVE. BUT

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:50.629
SO OF COURSE IS THE EVER- AND

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:51.864
ULTIMATELY LOSING BATTLE

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:56.035
AGAINST THE C. HANSI WALLS- ARE

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:58.604
ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THE THEY

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.973
WILL NEVER ALTERNATELY WIND-

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.374
BUT THEY DO THEY'RE CERTAINLY A

02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:05.244
DECENT AS- HIM. BUT VERY VERY

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:07.513
SHORT TERM ALTERNATIVE BUT- BUT

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.681
THEY ALSO DO COME WITH SEVERE

02:03:08.748 --> 02:03:09.882
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES IN

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:12.184
THOSE ARE OUTLINED. IN THE

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:14.620
ANALYSIS. SO THE ONLY TIME THAT

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:16.021
A FASCINATING SERIES ON THIS

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:18.124
TOPIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:20.025
CITIES ARE FACING IN TOWNS UP

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.927
AND DOWN OUR COAST. ARE VERY

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.996
TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT THEIR BUT

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:24.563
THE TOP OF THE CHOICES ARE

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:26.398
GONNA GET A WHOLE LOT HARDER-

02:03:26.465 --> 02:03:27.533
WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.968
TO COVER PROPERTIES BANKS WILL

02:03:29.034 --> 02:03:30.970
PROVIDE MORTGAGES. TO A

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.671
PROPERTIES THAT ARE AT RISK OF

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:34.640
SEA LEVEL RISE AND SO YOU KNOW.

02:03:34.707 --> 02:03:36.809
WE I THINK BACK ON THIS I THINK

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:38.778
ABOUT THIS TOPIC I THINK BACK.

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:40.713
TO OTHER BIG CHALLENGES WHAT

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.248
WHAT HOW MUCH YOU KNOW IN LIVES

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:43.115
AND TREASURE WE COULD HAVE

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:44.817
SAVED WE TAKE AN ACTION TWO

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:48.354
DECADES AGO- TO TAKE STEPS TO

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:49.922
LOWER THE RISK OF DEVASTATING

02:03:49.989 --> 02:03:52.324
WILDFIRES. AND SO SIMILAR

02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:54.627
SIMILAR TO FORWARD THINKING

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.796
IDEA HERE THE IDEA IS THAT WE

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:58.798
WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:03:58.864 --> 02:03:59.865
WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUCK IN THIS

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.167
VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:03.736
PREDICAMENT. ASSOCIATED WITH

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:06.405
AND WITH THE IDEA LIMITED CITY

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:08.941
COFFERS AND- THE CHALLENGES OF

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:10.042
PROTECTING PROPERTIES ON THE

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.410
COAST WE WOULD PROVIDE THEM

02:04:11.477 --> 02:04:13.779
WITH AN INNOVATIVE FINANCING

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:15.481
OPTION. TO ALLEVIATE THE RISKS

02:04:15.548 --> 02:04:16.715
OF SEA LEVEL RISE TO THE

02:04:16.782 --> 02:04:18.184
PROPERTIES IN THEIR TOWNS.

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:19.485
WHILE I PROTECTING BOTH

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:20.820
PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:22.588
THE IDEAS WE HAVE A REVOLVING

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:24.123
LOAN FUND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:26.125
THROUGH THE AYE BACK. TO BRIBE

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:26.826
PROPERTIES THAT WOULD BE

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:29.061
THREATENED AND IN IT THERE WILL

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:29.962
BE THREATENED IN A DECADE OR

02:04:30.029 --> 02:04:31.764
TWO OR THREE. ALLOWING THE

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.966
OWNERS TO SELL WHILE THE HOUSE

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.267
STILL HAS VALUE. AND THEN THE

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.502
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN RENT OUT

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:38.838
THE PROPERTY REPAYING THE LOAN

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:39.638
AND PREVENTS POTENTIALLY EVEN

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:41.640
EARNING REVENUE. AND THEN WHEN

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:42.374
THE PROPERTIES AT RISK OF

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:43.342
FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.543
THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:49.682
OR RELOCATED. WITHOUT LOCAL

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:50.282
RESIDENTS OR TAXPAYERS. DURING

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:51.851
THE COST. SO WE'VE WE WE'VE

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:52.885
BEEN ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:54.687
