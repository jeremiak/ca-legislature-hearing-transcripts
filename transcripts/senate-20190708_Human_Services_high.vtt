THE SENATE WE HAD A PRESENTATION.

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:45.644
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE EARLY

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.646
PRESENTATION I THINK IN FEBRUARY

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:48.947
AND I KNOW CENTER DRAWS THOSE.

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.348
THE LEGISLATION IS PROCEEDING AS

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:55.520
WELL BUT THE QUESTION I HAD --

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:58.323
FOR DO THE KIDS HAVE LAWYERS --

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.824
IS PART OF THE JOB WITH THE LAYS

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:00.959
ON IS TO CONNECTING WITH THE

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.594
LAWYERS RIGHT.

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:04.396
SO SO NORTHERN LAWYERS TO

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:05.463
REPRESENT.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.831
I LOOK AT THIS IS LIKE THEY

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.199
SHOULD HAVE LEARNED JUST LIKE

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:11.903
KIDS IT DEPENDS THE COURT ORDERS.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:12.537
OR THEY SHOULD HAVE LAWYERS WHO

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:13.138
THEY HAVE REPRESENTATION OF

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:14.673
THEIR RIGHTS.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.609
AND YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY NEEDS.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:18.576
TO INFLICT ON THE FEDERAL

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:20.845
GOVERNMENT LEGAL PROCESSES THAT

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:21.379
SHOULD BE THE PART OF THE

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:23.148
PROCESS RIGHT.

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:25.951
SO I A YOU KNOW COULD YOU MAYBE.

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:27.886
TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND I

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.688
THINK WE'RE SETTING IT UP.

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:33.058
THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE BILL BUT

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.225
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP ON THE

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.560
LEGAL LEGAL QUESTION I WOULD SAY

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.162
JUST FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:38.263
GOING TO THESE DIFFERENT

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.098
FACILITIES -- BOTH IN REDDING

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:41.399
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IT

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:42.934
DEPENDED ON THE ACTUAL PLEASE WE

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:45.403
WENT TO SO THERE ARE SOME --

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.405
FACILITY SECURE FACILITIES OR

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:48.506
REGULAR FACILITIES WHERE YOU

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:49.841
WOULD SPEAK TO KIDS WHO SAID --

00:26:49.908 --> 00:26:52.010
ABSOLUTELY THERE'S DEFINITELY AN

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.778
ATTORNEY -- WHO COMES HERE

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.480
WEEKLY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:56.948
UPDATED ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:58.917
THEIR CASE AND OTHER SITUATIONS

00:26:58.984 --> 00:26:59.985
HE WOULD SAY -- I'VE BEEN MEN

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.486
I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO A SOCIAL

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:03.521
WORKER BUT I NEVER MET HER AND

I'VE BEEN HERE FOR NINE MONTHS

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:05.924
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:06.825
ON WITH MY CASE.

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.594
IT WAS IT WAS INCONSISTENT TO

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.628
FATALLY OKAY SO IS SO I WOULD

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.263
SAY THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY WHEN

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.365
IT COMES TO THE PROCESS AND

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:15.467
SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED --

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:16.868
PERCENT AB ONE SIXTY THREE THAT

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:17.635
WOULD DEFINITELY RIGHT TO MAKE

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:18.737
SURE THAT IT STREAMLINED TO THE

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.139
EVERYONE KNOWS HAS ACCESS.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.008
TO I MEAN USUALLY THE LOCAL

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.442
ORGANIZATION ORAL LAW SCHOOL

CLINIC WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:28.613
AT LEAST WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.814
EACH INDIVIDUAL IN.

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:30.982
THE CENTER SKINNER AND I

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:37.188
REVIEWED SOME OF THE DEPENDENCY

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:37.956
COURT LEGAL.

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.824
ISSUES IN THE BUDGET

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.860
SUBCOMMITTEE WERE ON SO WE SPELL

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:42.761
OF TIME ON US AND WE TRIED TO

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:44.796
BRING THE DEPENDS ACCORDS LEGAL

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:45.897

AND IT SOUNDS LIKE.

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.403
THIS IS A SIMILAR KIND OF THE

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:53.838
ISSUE AND I AM.

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:54.773
YOU KNOW I KNOW WE PUT MONEY

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.441
INTO IMMIGRATION LAWYERS BUT I

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.675
THINK THESE.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.110
KIDS IS SPECIALLY SHOULD'VE

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:00.512
ORDERS.

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:01.379
OR SOMEBODY TO REPRESENT --

SOMEHOW.

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:06.651
AND YOU KNOW.

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:08.286
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE

THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT WE CAN

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:12.957
DO THAT -- THAT WOULD HELP.

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:13.525
I LIKE TO KNOW CAN YOU KNOW

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:14.526
SOMEBODY.

DOING A SOME KIND OF ASSESSMENT

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:18.797
OF THAT ISSUE.

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:19.597
SO AT NIGHT.

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.466
WHEN WHEN WE STARTED THIS BILL

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.201
WE WERE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE WHERE

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:24.736
WE SAID THEY HAVE TO HAVE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.137
LAWYERS MEN AND?

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:28.473
AND ASSESSMENT INCLUDING MENTAL

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.176
HEALTH -- AND SO IN THE PROCESS

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.445
YOU KNOW OF OF WORKING WITH THE

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:34.546
STAKEHOLDERS WE ENDED UP WITH

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.448
THIS LIAISON WE HURT WE HEAR

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.849
STORIES ABOUT THAT THERE'S JUST

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.217
ENOUGH FIRE TYING THEM YOU CALL

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:40.785
THIS NUMBER OR LEGAL ASSISTANCE.

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.687
WE PUT MONEY ASIDE IN THE BUDGET

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.022
TO HELP UNACCOMPANIED MINORS

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.091
LEAGUE BUT LEGAL -- SERVICES AND

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:47.559
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THESE

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.627
CHILDREN BUT OFTENTIMES THE

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.830
DOLLARS AREN'T ALL BEING USED

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.164
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE GROUPS

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:53.765
WILLING TO WORK WITH THE KIDS

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.634
BUT WHETHER THE KID IS TO MENTAL

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.669
OR SIXTEEN YEARS ON THERE TO

00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:58.303
GETTING THIS FIRE WHEN THEY SHOW

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:58.470
UP.

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.105
IN OUR CUSTODY THE THING THAT

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.407
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT TALLIES AT

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.275
THE LEAST I CAN MAKE SURE THAT

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:05.310
IT GOES BEYOND HIS THAT FLYER.

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:05.910
AND HOPEFULLY MAKE THE

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.412
CONNECTION TO THE LEGAL SERVICES

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.780
THAT ARE OUT THERE OR IF THERE

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.482
ARE NOT ENOUGH ATTORNEYS AND WE

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.250
WILL KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM TO

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.384
BUT RIGHT NOW.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.653
IT'S REALLY LIMITED WHEN WE ASK

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.922
HAD BEEN TOLD AT TIMES.

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:18.957
BUT EVEN REYES.

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.592
ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WE

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:21.759
HAVE THIS LICENSE THAT WOULD

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:22.894
DELIVER CHECK BECAUSE THEY'LL

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.062
STOP SENDING OF KIDS AND THEN

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.597
THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE I

00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:27.198
GOING TO GO TO WORST PLACES AND

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:27.799
THERE MIGHT BE SOME TO DO THAT

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:28.500
BUT HE'S SAYING WELL MAYBE IF WE

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:29.033
DID THE RIGHT.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.235
THING WE CAN ENCOURAGE OTHER

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.736
STATES TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD AD DO

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:33.605
THE RIGHT THING BY ALL THESE

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:41.579
KIDS ACROSS THE U. NOT TO SHARE

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.148
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:43.715
ON IT SO IT'S BEEN A REALLY

00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.449
FRUSTRATING PROCESS AS AS I

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.216
THINKABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.084
HAVE A TOOL AND WE SHOULD BE

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:46.651
LEVERAGING THAT SOMEWHERE I

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:47.886
DON'T PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT AT

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.254
AS AN ATTORNEY AS A SOCIAL

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.522
WORKER I I KNOW HOW TO TEACH YOU.

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:51.756
MATH AND THAT'S IT RIGHT AND I

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:52.357
KNOW HOW TO VOTE AND STUFF BUT

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.224
IN TALKING TO THE EXPERTS.

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.959
THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.127
COMPROMISE MOVING FORWARD TO AT

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:58.129
LEAST TRY TO DO IT BETTER I

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:58.796
THINK THROUGH THESE LIAISONS YOU

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.331
MIGHT DECIDE THAT WE NEED MORE

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:01.666
LATER.

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.568
BUT IT'S BEEN THE FIRST STEP --

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:06.137
IT IN IN THAT DIRECTION AND SO I

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.672
HAVE TO JUST TRUST AND THE

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.274
EXPERTS TELL ME THAT THAT THIS

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.043
IS A GOOD FOR STEPS TO GO TO FOR

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:17.148
THE FIRST HURDLE.

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:20.018
ARE YOU YEAH THE QUESTION I I

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:20.685
WAS THE ISSUE I WANTED TO RAISE.

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:21.619
I THINK WHEN WE START

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:23.521
RECOGNIZING THESE CHILDREN AS

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:24.656
HUMAN BEINGS.

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:26.424
ARE THAT'S THE FIRST STEP WE

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.326
NEED TO TAKE LAWYERS OF COURSE

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:30.795
THEY NEED LAWYERS EVERYONE.

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:32.430
WHO COMES INTO THIS COUNTRY IS

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.831
TECHNICALLY ENTITLED TO BE

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:36.000
REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:38.169
WHATEVER THE GRIEVANCES ARE THAT?

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:39.837
ARE BEING PRESENTED TO THEM.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.306
WHETHER BY THE GOVERNMENT OR

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.041
WHAT HAVE YOU AND I'M JUST

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.676
REMINDED OF THE DISCUSSION WE

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.444
HAD I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHEN

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.912
IT WAS BUT A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.847
WHEN A FEDERAL JUDGE DETERMINED

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:51.115
THAT A THREE YEAR OLD WAS

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.985
CAPABLE OF REPRESENTING OUR SELF?

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.954
IN A YEAR -- AN IN IMMIGRATION

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.424
PROCEEDINGS.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.025
IF WE'RE AT THAT POINT.

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:03.494
IT'S JUST THE START ISSUING A

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:04.562
GAG EITHER THOUGH THERE'S NO

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:05.463
DESCRIPTIVE WORD I CAN USE THEIR

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.331
BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:09.133
TRYING TO DO HERE.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.602
AND AGAIN I THINK -- WHEN WE

00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:12.737
START LOOKING AT THESE CHILDREN

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:14.105
AND THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:15.940
FAMILIES AS HUMAN BEINGS LIKE

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:19.110
OURSELVES -- WE WILL HAVE COME A

00:31:19.177 --> 00:31:21.546
LONG WAY BUT UNTIL THEN I YEAH.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.114
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:31.623
TO DO AND MOVES THE BILL.

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:32.890
SO DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.592
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.729

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.840
OUR ALL MORTIFIED BY THE STORIES

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:50.308
THAT WERE SEEN -- AND

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.710
HEARTBROKEN -- AND SO I

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.157
THE OFFICE IS MY POINT.

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:21.926

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.661
SOMEONE COULD BE.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.596
HAVE THEIR BENEFITS DEDUCTED
