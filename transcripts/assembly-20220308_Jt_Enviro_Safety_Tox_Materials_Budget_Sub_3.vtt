AND I'M NOW ON THE SUSTAINABLE

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.148
PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP THAT

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:44.982
SECRETARY BLUMENFELD JUST

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.350
MENTIONED- WHICH IS A

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.651
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO DEVELOP

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.153
A ROADMAP FOR SAFER SUSTAINABLE

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.354
PESTICIDE PRACTICES IN

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.622
CALIFORNIA WHILE STILL

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:54.358
SUPPORTING OUR VIBRANT

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:56.427
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. SO I'VE

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:57.461
BEEN ASKED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.563
WHY WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.064
PESTICIDE REGULATION IN

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.866
CALIFORNIA- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:04.101
FEW REASONS- FIRST THE

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.103
PESTICIDES THAT WE PUT ON FIELDS

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.972
DON'T STAY THERE. THEY END UP

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.540
WASHING INTO SURFACE WATERS LIKE

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:10.608
RIVERS AND STREAMS WHERE THEY

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.610
CAN IMPACT QUICKLY AND OUR

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.378
DRINKING WATER. ARE THEY ALSO

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.946
DRIFT INTO THE AIR INSIDE

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.481
PEOPLE'S HOMES AND EVEN INTO OUR

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:19.583
BODIES. SO AIR MONITORING

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.785
SYSTEMS TELL US THAT AFTER

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.253
PESTICIDES ARE USED ON FEELS

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.421
THEY CAN LATER BE DETECTED IN-

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.924
ERR UP TO TWO TO FIVE MILES AWAY

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:27.725
DEPENDING ON THE COMPOUNDS AND

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:31.028
HOW IT WAS APPLIED- IN OUR

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.297
WE FOUND THAT 98% OF HOMES HAD

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:34.932
DETECTABLE PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.700
THEIR HOUSE DUST. IN THE LEVELS

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:39.003
WERE HIGHER WHEN PEOPLE LIVE

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.271
CLOSE IN A FIELD WHERE PASS

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:43.107
THESE PESTS AS WE USED. WE ALSO

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.542
DETECTED PESTICIDES IN PEOPLE'S

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.577
BODIES FOR EXAMPLE WE TOOK URINE

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:47.778
SAMPLES FROM PREGNANT WOMEN AND

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:48.979
CHILDREN LIVING IN A FARMWORKER

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:50.447
COMMUNITY. AND FOUND THAT ALL OF

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.516
THEM. HAD DETECTABLE PESTICIDES

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:54.451
IN THEIR URINE. WE'VE ALSO FOUND

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.619
PESTICIDES IN THEIR BLOOD

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.588
SAMPLES AND EVEN IN BREAST MILK.

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.823
SO WE KNOW PESTICIDES ARE

00:40:58.889 --> 00:40:59.857
GETTING INTO PEOPLE'S BODIES

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:00.891
WHEN THEY LIVE NEAR FIELDS OR

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.326
WHEN THEY LIVE WITH PEOPLE THAT

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.794
WORK IN THE FIELDS ARE BRINGING

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.462
PESTICIDES HOME ON THEIR

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.832
CLOTHING OR OTHER PATHWAYS. THE

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.266
SECOND REASON I THINK PERSONALLY

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.001
THE MOST CRITICAL REASON. IS THE

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:12.303
PESTICIDE THE PESTICIDE

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.504
REGULATION IS IMPORTANT IS THAT

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.372
WE HAVE VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THE

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:16.207
PESTICIDE USE IMPACTS BRAIN

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:17.741
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN LIVING

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.710
IN AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES. OUT

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:21.078
ONE OF THE CLASSES OF PESTICIDES

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.580
THAT ARE JAMARCO STUDY HAS BEEN

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.148
RESEARCHING FOR MANY YEARS. IS

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:25.850
THE CLASS CALLED ORGANIC

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:26.417
PHOSPHATES WHICH ARE POTENT

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.019
NEUROTOXINS- CLIP YOUR FAUCET

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.588
YOU JUST HEARD MENTIONED. BY THE

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.323
PESTICIDE THAT WAS BANNED BY DPR

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:34.391
IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS AN

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.192
ORGANOPHOSPHATE IS AN EXAMPLE OF

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.127
THE ORGAN OF FACETS- AND THE WAY

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:38.596
WE'RE GONNA FOSSEY'S WORK IS THE

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:39.663
EFFECTIVELY SHUT DOWN THE

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.532
NERVOUS SYSTEM EVENTS IN SACKS.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:44.235
AND THEY CAN DO THE SAME THING

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.402
IN MAMMALS INCLUDING HUMANS. WE

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:46.904
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ADULTS IS

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.205
WHEN AN ADULT IS POISONED BY

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:49.807
ORGANIC PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES IT

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:51.175
CAUSES CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:52.676
DAMAGE THAT CAN LEAD TO

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:54.011
PARALYSIS AND EVEN DEATH. BUT

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.346
WHEN WE STARTED OUR RESEARCH

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.481
TWENTY YEARS AGO WE HAD NO IDEA

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.650
WHAT THE EFFECTS. OF CHRONIC LOW

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.552
DOSE ON GOING EXPOSURE TO

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.354
ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES WORDS

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.723
ON THE DEVELOPING BRAIN OF

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:10.294
CHILDREN WHO LIVE NEARBY. SO IN

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.262
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:12.363
THOUSAND WE ENROLLED SIX HUNDRED

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.064
PREGNANT WOMEN LIVING IN FROM

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:14.598
MARKET COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.400
SALINAS VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. WE

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:17.635
HAVE FOLLOWED THESE WOMEN AND

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:18.903
THEIR CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.437
TWENTY YEARS THE KIDS ARE YOUNG

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:21.906
ADULTS NOW. AND WE SEE THEIR

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.307
CHILDREN EVERY TWO TO THREE

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:24.975
YEARS AND CONTRACT SORRY ONE TO

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.277
TWO YEARS AND CONDUCT DETAILED

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.279
HEALTH EXAMS AND NERD OF

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:30.047
ELEMENTAL TEST BATTERIES ON THEM

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.515
. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THE

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:33.150
MOTHERS WHO HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.485
AGAIN A FAUCET MUSCLE

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.219
METABOLITES IN THEIR URINE

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.887
DURING PREGNANCY. HAD CHILDREN

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.722
WITH MORE ABNORMAL REFLEXES AT

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:41.525
BIRTH. POOR VERBAL ABILITY IS H.

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.928
THREE N. H. FIVE. LOWER IQ AT

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.930
AGE SEVEN- AND SPECIFICALLY WHEN

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:47.564
WE COMPARED KIDS WHOSE MOMS HAD

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.565
THE HIGHEST LEVELS WERE GONNA

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:50.401
FAUCETS IN THEIR BODIES TO THOSE

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:52.736
WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS. WE SAW A

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.238
DIFFERENCE ABOUT SEVEN I Q.

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.906
POINTS AND TO GIVE YOU SOME

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:56.540
CONTEXT TO THAT. THAT'S ABOUT

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.409
WHAT WE SEE WITH LEAD POISONING

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.977
KIDS WITH LEAD POISONING WE SEE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.412
ABOUT A SEVEN POINT DROP IN IQ

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:04.782
ON AVERAGE. SO THIS IS A REAL

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:06.650
CONCERN FOR US. OF COURSE IF IT

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:08.585
IS A CONTROL GROUP THE CHEF OF

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:10.087
THE THING AND- THE SECOND PART.

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.956
YES THE NEXT QUESTION. OUR OUR

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.390
STUDY POPULATION IS OFTEN THE

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.391
SALINAS VALLEY THEY'RE ALL

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.026
LIVING IN THE SAME COMMUNITY

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.062
THEY ARE ALL LOW INCOME MOST

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.530
ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE MEXICAN

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.432
IMMIGRANTS THAT WE HAVE IS A

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:22.766
VERY HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION. BUT

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:23.600
THEY BUT THEY ARE WHERE THEY

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.135
DIFFER IS THEIR PESTICIDE LEVELS

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:26.837
IN THEIR BODIES WE ALSO CONTROL

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:27.838
FOR OTHER FACTORS LIKE MATERNAL

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:32.109
IQ AT PARENTAL EDUCATION WE

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.811
CONTROL FOR A BUNCH OF THINGS.

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:34.578
SO BUT- THAT'S A EXCELLENT

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:37.715
QUESTION- WE ALSO SEE IN THE

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.116
SAME POPULATION THAT MOTHERS

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.551
EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATE AND

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:41.885
PREGNANCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:44.822
ADHD AUTISM LIKE BEHAVIORS AND

00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:47.324
EVEN DECREASED BRAIN ACTIVATION

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:48.392
ON BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES AND

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:52.329
THEIR KIDS- SO AT THIS POINT-

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:53.797
THERE IS A VERY STRONG BODY OF

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.132
LITERATURE FROM OUR STUDY AND

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.867
ALSO FROM SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES.

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:58.268
SHOWING ASSOCIATIONS ORGANIC

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.636
PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES WITH DELAYS

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:00.604
AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.439
CHILDREN WHICH IS ONE OF THE

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.374
MAIN REASONS CALIFORNIA PLANT

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.275
BANNED CHLORPYRIFOS IN TWENTY

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:06.477
NINETEEN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.912
BEFORE THE FEDERAL EPA BANDIT-

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.781
BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THE

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.683
CLIP PURPOSES JUST ONE OF AN

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.584
ENTIRE CLASS OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.386
PESTICIDES AND WE HAVEN'T BANNED

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:16.253
THE OTHERS. AND THEY CAN STILL

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.654
BE USED IN AGRICULTURE- EVEN

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.489
THOUGH THEY HAVE SOME OF THE

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:20.991
SAME MANY OF THE SAME HEALTH

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.694
CONCERNS- AS CLIPPERS HAS CLICK

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:25.629
HERE FOR US. ON THE PLUS SIDE

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.264
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.499
SEEN IS THE USE OF AGAIN A

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.200
FAUCET PESTICIDES HAS DECREASED

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:30.801
CONSIDERABLY- OVER THE LAST

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:33.037
DECADE OR SO- BUT- OVER THAT

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.638
TIME. AGAIN OF FACETS OF BEEN

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:35.806
REPLACED BY NEWER CLASSES OF

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.908
PESTICIDES LIKE PYRETHROIDS THAT

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:38.942
ARE LESS ACUTELY TOXIC TO

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:41.245
HUMANS. BUT IT TAKES A WHILE FOR

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:42.646
OUR RESEARCH TO CATCH UP SO

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.148
WE'RE NOW STARTING TO SEE

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:45.182
EVIDENCE THE PYRETHROIDS MAY

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.216
ALSO HARM CHILDREN'S INNER

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:48.552
DEVELOPMENT. IN IN OUR STUDY

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.820
POPULATION WE SAW LOWER I CUES

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.588
AND CHILDREN WHOSE MOTHERS LIVE

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.790
CLOSE TO FIELDS WERE PYRETHROID

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:53.724
PESTICIDES REPLIED DURING THE

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.559
PREGNANCY. AND THERE IS OTHER

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:57.094
RESEARCH THAT'S STARTING TO

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:57.628
SUPPORT HIS FAMILY THESE

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:59.696
FINDINGS ALSO. I'M SO EVEN AS WE

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.165
REPLACE ONE PESTICIDE CLASS WITH

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.599
ANOTHER WE HAVE REASONS TO BE

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:05.202
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.470
IMPACTS OF THE NEW COMPOUNDS-

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:07.971
OVER THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS OR

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.306
SO WE'VE SEEN BROAD TRENDS AND

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.208
PESTICIDE USE THE DDT OF THE

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:13.043
NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.044
WHICH WAS HIGHLY PERSISTENT IN

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:16.046
THE ENVIRONMENT- AND ALMOST MADE

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.414
A BALD EAGLES EXTINCT WAS

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.582
REPLACED BY ORGANIC PHOSPHATES

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:19.616
THE DIDN'T PERSIST IN THE

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.318
ENVIRONMENT BUT WE'RE NEUROTOXIC

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.953
TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. AS AGAIN

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.588
OF FACETS OF FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:25.556
WE'VE NOW SEEN THE RISE OF

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:26.657
PYRETHROIDS AND NOW THE

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.192
NEONICOTINOIDS ANOTHER OTHER

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:30.127
PESTICIDES. WHICH BRINGS ME TO

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.562
THE THIRD REASON WE SHOULD CARE

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:32.896
ABOUT PESTICIDE REGULATION.

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:35.499
WHICH IS IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS.

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.568
ALTHOUGH NEONICOTINOIDS APPEAR

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.236
TO HAVE FEWER HUMAN HEALTH

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.370
IMPACTS. THEY'RE VERY PERSISTENT

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:41.705
IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY BUILD UP

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.440
SYSTEMICALLY INSIDE PLANTS AND A

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.576
VERY TOXIC TO INSECTS. MOST

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.144
NOTABLY THE NITTANY OWNIK

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.545
INSECTICIDES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:50.114
CRASHES AND HONEY BEE AND OTHER

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.116
PUBLIC POLLINATOR POPULATIONS.

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:53.484
THEY ALSO GET INTO OUR STREAMS

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.018
AND RIVERS. LEADING TO DECREASES

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.153
IN THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.688
OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES WHICH

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.590
CAN THEN IMPACT FISH AND BIRD

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:00.457
POPULATIONS THAT RELY ON THEM

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.526
FOR FOOD. AND EVEN THOUGH WE

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.627
THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE FOR

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.863
HUMANS WE ARE NOW STARTING TO

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.530
HAVE CONCERNS. THAT THE NEW NEXT

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.532
MAY ALSO IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.266
INCLUDING INCREASED RISK OF

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.868
BIRTH DEFECTS. THE HUMAN

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.269
RESEARCH ON THE NEONICOTINOIDS

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:16.273
IS STILL VERY NEW. AND WE'RE

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.441
JUST STARTING TO LEARN THE FULL

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.176
IMPLICATIONS- LASTLY I JUST WANT

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.444
TO POINT OUT IN CASE YOU'RE NOT

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.679
AWARE THAT A LOT OF THE BEST

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:23.380
RESEARCH IN THE WORLD OF

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.782
PESTICIDES IN THEIR IMPACTS- IS

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:26.450
DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ONE

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.185
OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS IS

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.887
BECAUSE OF THE RICH PESTICIDE

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:30.454
USE REPORTING DATA THE TPR

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.089
COLLECTS. IN CALIFORNIA WERE

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.524
ABLE TO MAP ALL PESTICIDE USE

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.492
DOWN TO THE SQUARE MILE AND WHEN

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:38.362
IT WAS APPLIED WHICH IS A HUGE

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:39.363
BECAUSE WE CAN'T LEARN ABOUT THE

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.697
EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES. IF WE

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.633
DON'T HAVE DATA ABOUT WHAT IS

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:45.536
BEING USED IN WHERE IT'S BEING

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:49.306
USED- SO. ADJUSTED TO SUM UP IM

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:50.741
SH AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:51.775
REGULATING PESTICIDES IS

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:52.676
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING BALANCE OF

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:53.610
PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.078
ECOSYSTEMS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.446
AND PROTECTING. OUR VITAL

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:58.515
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY- AND I

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:00.217
HOPE AS YOU TALK MORE OVER THE

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:01.418
NEXT FEW MONTHS ABOUT HOW

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.386
PESTICIDE REGULATIONS CONDUCTED

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:04.588
IN CALIFORNIA. YOU ALSO TO CAN.

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.423
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHY IT'S

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.357
IMPORTANT- INCLUDING PROTECTING

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.393
THE BRAINS AND THE HEALTH OF THE

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.061
CHILDREN THEIR LIVING NEAR

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.329
FIELDS- THE FARMWORKERS WHO ARE

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.364
PICKING UP FOOD. AND

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.567
BIODIVERSITY IN OUR STATE. THANK

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:18.769
YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR-

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:21.338
INTERESTING TESTIMONY WE HAVE A

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.440
QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:24.441
MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER ALI

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.977
AWAY IT. IN THE STUDY IS THEIR

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.379
DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN THE

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:32.649
APPLICATION OF THE PESTICIDE.

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:34.484
FIRST LIKE SPRAY VERSUS

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:37.054
PALLETIZED IN A WITH A LOT OF

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.854
CROPS ESPECIALLY WITH CLLR FOR

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.623
FOSTER. THEY'VE COMPLETELY GONE

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.025
AWAY FROM THE SPRAY THEY JUST TO

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.293
THE PALLETIZED THE DUDE THE

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.528
SIGNAGE THEY DO THESE OTHER

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.129
THINGS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.431
STAYING AWAY IN THAT IT ON THE

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.466
GROUND SO THERE'S NOT AN AIR

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:51.368
TRANSMISSION. QUALITY SO I JUST

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:51.969
DOES THAT IS THERE DISTINCT

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.303
VACATION WITH TAT BECAUSE I

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.371
THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING YEAH

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:55.606
BECAUSE I KNOW AGRICULTURE'S

00:47:55.672 --> 00:47:57.307
GONE A LONG WAY. TO GET AWAY

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.610
FROM MANY THINGS SO THAT WAY IT

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.144
IS SAFER YEAH NO I WOULD HAVE

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.646
WOULD SAY THAT THAT THINGS HAVE

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:03.547
CHANGED SO MUCH SINCE WE'VE

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:05.549
SINCE WE STARTED THEIR STUDY. IN

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.717
ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WHAT WE

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:08.619
DO IS WE MEASURE THE LEVEL OF

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:09.553
PESTICIDES INSIDE THEIR BODIES

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.188
SO WE'RE TAKING URINE SAMPLES OR

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:12.923
BLOOD SAMPLES WHERE WOMEN WERE

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.691
WERE AND GEO CODING WHERE THEY

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:16.193
LIVE RELATIVE TO THE FIELD. BUT

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.527
BUT ONE OF THE MEASURE THE

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.296
LEVELS INSIDE THE BODY WE CAN'T

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:20.397
ACTUALLY TELL WAT YEAH IT

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:22.466
FOUNDER AND VIDEO. YOU NEED TO

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.667
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:24.901
DISTINGUISHING. IF YOU'RE

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:26.803
POPULATION BASE AND SAY THEY'RE

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.873
DOING A SPRAY PROCESS. VERSES

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.441
THE PALLETIZED PROCESS WITH THE

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.477
NEWER PROCESS. NEEDS TO BE A

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.145
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT BECAUSE

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.480
THIS REYES DEFINITELY GONNA

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:38.048
CARRY WHICH IS WHY THEY SWITCHED

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.650
OVER. TO THIS OF THE RESEARCH

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:42.719
INDUSTRY FLAG THOSE CHANGES. IN

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:43.820
I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT A WITHIN

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.389
THE BODY'S WHAT'S IN THE HOME

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:47.791
THAT THAT'S VITAL- ON. TO THOSE

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.793
POPULATIONS EXPRESSLY. AS WE'RE

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.161
LOOKING AT THESE THINGS BUT WE

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.696
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.097
ALSO NOTING IF THE NEARBY

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:56.600
PHARMACY BRAIN. VERSUS IF THIRD

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.503
MOVEMENT TO THE PALLETIZED MODEL

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:07.344
TO KEEP. THAT DRAFT THERE. FOR

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.246
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.447
THAT REFER IF WE LOOK AT WHAT

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.516
HOW BEING APPLY WHICH IS THAT

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:14.084
REFLECT IN WHAT'S INTO THEIR

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.118
HOMES AND SCATTERED ABOUT APPS

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:16.853
BUT IT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.288
THAT WE KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.890
IS THE PRACTICE IN THAT

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:20.424
COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.225
PRACTICE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:24.594
CAN SHOW THE LEVELS OF GONE DOWN

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:25.762
SINCE WE SWITCHED TO PALLETIZED

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.831
THAT NEEDS TO BE NOTED AND I

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.398
AGREE. VERY MUCH SO. YEAH I

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.866
AGREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BETTER.

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:30.534
QUICK QUICK. QUESTION IN YOUR

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.235
FIRST STATEMENT HE SAID THAT

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.637
THEY FOUND PESTICIDES IT DID

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:34.971
TOO. WE KNOW THESE PESTICIDES

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:36.006
GET INTO PEOPLE'S BODIES AND

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:37.908
THEY FOUND. IT ARE WE FOR. DO WE

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:40.143
HAVE A CONTROL GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.411
THAT ARE FARMWORKERS- THAT ARE.

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.313
GETTING THE US VERSUS. PEOPLE

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.115
ARE NOT FARMWORKERS ANISUR

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:45.916
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:47.651
ENGLAND A PESTICIDE. THE EASIEST

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:48.518
WAY FOR US TO MAKE THAT

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.354
COMPARISON. IS THAT WE NEED

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.321
THESE BIOMARKERS OF. OF

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.389
DIFFERENT PESTICIDES ARE ALSO

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:54.858
MEASURED- NATIONALLY. SO THE CDC

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.293
HAS A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.761
POPULATION IN THE ENHANCE HAND

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.396
STUDY AND WHEN WE COMPARE WITH

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.997
THE NATIONAL. POPULATION WE HAVE

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:04.401
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS. OF

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:07.771
INNOCENT ISRAELI POPULATION. FOR

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:12.876
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MATHIS WITH

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.910
THAT OBVIOUSLY OUR CULTURE IN

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:15.245
THE SALINAS VALLEY IS DIFFERENT

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.847
SAY THAN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:19.216
VALLEY IN EVEN DIFFERENT BETWEEN

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:21.718
EAST AND WEST NORTH AND SOUTH SO

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.020
I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT OTHER

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:27.090
CONTROL GROUPS SHE IN THE SAN

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:27.858
JOAQUIN VALLEY. VERSES THE

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:30.060
IMPERIAL VALLEY WHAT THAT WOULD

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:31.128
LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THOSE

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.730
PRACTICES ARE VERY MUCH

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.098
DIFFERENT AND I THINK.

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.134
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.603
APPLICATIONS. ESPECIALLY WITH

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:41.605
THE DIFFERENT CROPS. OF COURSE

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.740
DIFFERENT CROPS DO THINGS QUITE

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:46.443
DIFFERENTLY- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.010
GONNA STRAWBERRIES VERSUS

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:51.248
CITRUS- VERSUS PEPPERS. YOU KNOW

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:53.183
SO I THINK GETTING MORE INTO

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.786
THAT AS WELL- YOU KNOW SALINAS

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.421
VALLEY'S IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT

00:50:57.487 --> 00:51:00.223
IT'S THE SALAD BOWL- BUT

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.058
UNDERSTAND IT WHAT SAY HAPPENS

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:05.529
IN THE CITRUS BELT YEAH BECAUSE

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:06.997
FEAR PROCESS HOW IT TIES

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.566
APPLICATIONS BEING DONE. IN

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:10.200
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE LEVELS

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:13.570
ARE THERE- VERSUS SOMEWHERE THAT

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.338
THAT IT HISTORICALLY SPRAYED IN

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.706
NOW IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:18.008
THAT THOSE DISTINCTIONS ARE

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.510
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT- IN

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.145
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.213
US GOING FORWARD AS WE DECIDE

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.781
WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE. I

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.149
COMPLETELY AGREE AND I WOULD

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:28.251
LOVE TO SEE MORE RESEARCH ON

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.252
WHAT THE PESTICIDE MIX AND WHAT

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.154
THE EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE LIKE AND

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.155
HOW THAT DIFFERS IN DIFFERENT

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.356
REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA. I THIS IS

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.625
BEEN IT'S SUCH AN IN DEPTH

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.226
EXTENSIVE STUDY OVER TWENTY

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.160
YEARS OF MORE THAN MILLION

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:39.129
DOLLARS A YEAR TO CONDUCT IT AND

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.597
IF WE COULD DO MORE RESEARCH

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.032
LIKE THIS AND OTHER LOCATIONS. I

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.266
THINK MY CONCERNS FIRST MISTER

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.434
CHAIRMAN IS THAT IF WE JUST HONE

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:49.072
IN ON THE SALINAS VALLEY. AND WE

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:50.073
HAVE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.208
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT IS VERY AND-

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.476
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:53.577
DIFFERENT AREAS ESPECIALLY

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:54.945
AGRICULTURE ACROSS THE STATE

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:56.680
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FOUR HUNDRED

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.381
EIGHT. DIFFERENT COMMODITIES

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.016
THAT ARE BEING GROWN I MEAN

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:00.750
THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY.

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:03.019
DIFFERENT APPLICATION PROCESSES

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:03.720
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:06.189
HAPPENING- SO WE NEED TO MAKE

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.424
SURE THAT WE- TAKE THAT INTO

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.259
CONCERNED. BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:11.561
SAY OKAY THIS. SALINAS VALLEY IS

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.430
YOU KNOW MAYBE TWENTY OF THOSE

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.131
FOR EXAMPLE NAY AMHERST ON

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.666
TWENTY OTHERS A NUMBER. BUT WHEN

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.668
YOU REALLY BREAK IT DOWN THEY'RE

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.303
STILL FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.939
DIFFERENT COMMODITY CROPS. THAT

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.941
WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND SO THAT

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.410
THAT'S A VAST DIFFERENCE THAT WE

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:29.379
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.014
. AND I DON'T AND I THINK WHAT

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:32.516
I'M HEARING CUT DR HARLEY SAY

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:35.819
IS- THAT WE HAVE SOME TOPLINE

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.855
DATA THAT INDICATES THAT- HI

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:41.491
THERE ARE IMPACTS ON- YOUNG

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:43.293
CHILDREN THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.095
CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE NEED TO

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:45.929
DRILL DOWN FURTHER TO

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.565
UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW HOW THAT

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:50.367
BREAKS DOWN OF IT FOR NOW

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:51.401
OPERATES IN THE DIFFERENT

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.436
REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND IF I

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:54.404
COULD JUST MENTION THERE ARE

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:55.338
OTHER STUDIES BESIDES OUR STUDY

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.340
THAT HAVE LOOKED MORE STATEWIDE

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:58.542
LOOKING REALLY AT WHAT'S BEEN

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.944
APPLIED AND CHILDREN LIVE NEARBY

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.145
AND WE'RE SEEING SOME VERY

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:03.580
SIMILAR FINDINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.382
THE STATE THAT Y. DATA IT'S NOT

00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:07.918
THE SAME. LEVEL OF DETAIL IS

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.185
WHAT WE GET IN OUR SMALL

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.720
POPULATION BUT IT'S SORT OF

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:11.521
REPLICATED WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:14.024
LOOK AT A LOT MORE STATEWIDE

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.724
POPULATION CORRECT WHICH IS.

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:17.294
AGAIN WHY THE I THINK KNOWING

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.729
THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IN THE

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:22.065
DIFFERENT RECENT REGIONS IS

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.500
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:25.068
DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE NEED

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.403
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:28.305
BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:29.339
THESE FAMILIES ARE BEING TAKEN

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:31.942
CARE OF IT IS VERY VITAL. FOR

00:53:32.008 --> 00:53:32.976
OUR IMMIGRANT AG FARM

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:34.244
COMMUNITIES THAT THESE THINGS

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:36.212
ARE BEING DONE BUT WE HAVE TO

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.480
KNOW YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE THEY

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.683
DOING IT WHAT'S THE COMPARISON

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:43.353
AND HAVE. THE CORRELATING DATA.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.955
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:48.458
TESTIMONY. VERY INTERESTING AND-

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:49.926
I UNDERSTAND WE'RE JUST GETTING

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.128
A SUMMARY TODAY BUT- APPRECIATED

VIRTUALLY ALL OF IT ENDED AS OF

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.547
THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. I'M

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:26.683
REALLY EXCITED- TO BE IN THIS

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.785
ROLE- BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:31.254

THINK IT'S DR HARLEY MENTIONED-

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.701
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND PESTICIDES ON

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.636
A RISKY AND SO THE MORE THAT WE

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:48.605

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.340

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.745
EXCITED TO BE IN THIS ROLE

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:56.646
BECAUSE AS THE SECRETARY

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:00.517
DEAL OF COLLABORATION AND- I'M

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.785
LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.287

SEE THAT VISION BECOME A ALITY.

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:16.566
OUR MISSION AT THE MOST

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.434
FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL IS REGULATING

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:20.403
PESTICIDES- AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.839
THEIR USE IS SAFE ON BOTH FOR

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:23.873
HUMAN HEALTH AND FOR THE

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.608
ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S MUCH MORE

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.644
THAN NOT IT'S ALSO FOSTERING THE

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.179
USE OF SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:31.414
PRACTICES AND NOW WE REALLY HAVE

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:36.586
TO ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION.

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:38.388
WE'RE COMMITTED IN BOTH OF THESE

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:39.823
ROLES TO EQUITY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON AS THE

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:43.226
SECRETARY MENTIONED. AND A KEY

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.994
PART OF THAT IS ENGAGING

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:47.630
MEANINGFULLY WITH COMMUNITIES TO

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:48.765
ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES AND

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.633
CONCERNS ABOUT PESTICIDE USE AND

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.068
WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:54.671
PROBLEMS. A SECRETARY BLOOMFIELD

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.539
LUNCHEON CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.208
SOUGHT OUT AS A LEADER IN

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:01.477
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH MATTERS

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.046
AND WE SEEK THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.682
AS DPR BOTH AND ARE REGULATORY

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.584
EFFORTS. AS WELL AS OUR EFFORTS

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.019
TO MOVE TO SAFER AND MORE

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:10.887
SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. AS THE

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:12.288
SECRETARY MENTIONED AND AS I

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:13.857
NOTED THIS REQUIRES A LOT OF

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.458
COLLABORATION ACROSS ALL OF OUR

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:17.594
STAKEHOLDERS AND IT'S NOT EASY

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.296
WORK- BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.298
THE COMMITMENT OF SO MANY OF OUR

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.533
STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE JOINED.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.801

WORK GROUP AND ARE WORKING

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.805
TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:30.006
ROADMAP AND GOALS FOR GETTING US

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:31.507
THERE. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.276
DEPARTMENT'S REGULATORY WALL AS

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.311
IT STANDS TODAY. BUT I THINK

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.780
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.649
ROLE EVOLVES OVER TIME- AS WE

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.751
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NEW SCIENCE

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:43.019
AND SUCH AS BOTHERED DR HARLEY

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:45.388
MENTIONED. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.356
WE'RE KEEPING UP WITH

00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:48.424
SCIENCE AND PROTECTING PUBLIC

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.293
HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT. SO AS

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.695
QUICK BACKGROUND- ON PESTICIDE

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.697
REGULATION THE STATE PASSED ITS

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:57.700

NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:01.371
DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:03.306
AGRICULTURE WAS RESPONSIBLE. FOR

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:05.475
REGULATING PESTICIDES- DPR WAS

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.810
CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:09.479

ESTABLISHMENT- BY GOVERNOR

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.986
WAY WE MANAGE POTS AFFECTS

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:18.688

ACCELERATING THE USE OF SAFER

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:14.410
AND MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES-

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.846

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.059
COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES USING

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.733
MAJORITY OF WHICH WE ASSOCIATE

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.568
WITH THE INCREASE IN SALES OF

HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.289

ASSESSMENT IS NOT CHANGE IT IS

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:13.434
LIKELY THE FUND BALANCE WILL

RESPONSE BUT AS I MENTIONED- I

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.179

PHOSPHATES. ON THEIR HEALTH- WE

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.223
CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE NEW

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:10.558
SCIENCE AND STUDIES THAT COME

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.693
OUT- THAT IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.528
RISKS AND HARMS. FOR ALL

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:15.930
PESTICIDE PRODUCTS INCLUDING

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:18.866
ORGANIC PHOSPHATES- AND AT ANY

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.068
ONE TIME WILL WILL HAVE A NUMBER

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:23.638

IS A LOT OF OVERLAPPING

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:36.450
CHEMISTRY IS WITHIN THE ORGANIC

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:38.853
PHOSPHATE CLASS AND SO WE LOOK

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.588
AT A COMBINATION OF THAT USE

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.223
RECORDS THAT WE HAVE WHICH ARE

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.658

HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THE SYSTEM

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.541
AND WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE AND

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:02.743
SO I'M ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THE

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:03.911

MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP AND OTHER

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.349
PLACES ARE GONNA BE HELPFUL AS

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.383
WERE THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:11.018
WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:12.586
MANAGE AND SEX AND HOW THAT FITS

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:16.857

YOURSELF HAVE MENTIONED. A FOCUS

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.167
ON CHILDREN WHICH I THINK WE

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.202
WOULD ALL AGREE- IS EXTREMELY

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:32.006
IMPORTANT- A DOCTOR HARLEY-

UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A-

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.226
LARGE. BODY OF RESEARCH AND

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.161
EVIDENCE THAT- BRAIN

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:57.231
DEVELOPMENT- DOESN'T END WITH

01:33:57.298 --> 01:34:00.935

AFFECTS OF- OF ON ON BRAIN

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:24.525
HEALTH OF ADULTS AS WELL- SO I

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:26.160
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THAT

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:28.129
THOSE. ALL SENSITIVE POPULATIONS

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:31.198
ARE PART OF- OUR REVIEW- BUT ALL

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.933
TURNED OVER TO DOCTOR MORRISON

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.301
TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:36.504
WE DEFINE CHILDREN SO WE DEFINE

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.973
CHILDREN AS AS MINOR SEVEN

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.307
SEVENTEEN AND UNDER OUR

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:44.078
EVALUATIONS TEND TO FOCUS ON-

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.679
THE MOST SENSITIVE POPULATIONS

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.882
WHICH IS OFTEN. ON WOMEN OF

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:52.219
CHILDREN AGE TO IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.954
WE'VE SEEN FOR THE HIGHEST

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.423
LIKELIHOOD EXPOSURE TO

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.558
PESTICIDES AS WELL AS WHERE I'M

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:00.061
THERE'S KEY MILESTONES IN BRAIN
