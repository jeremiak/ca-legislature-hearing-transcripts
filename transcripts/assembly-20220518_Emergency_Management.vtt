THOSE FOR- WELL OVER A YEAR NOW

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.595
AND- WE'VE SEEN. PRETTY STEADY

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:12.930
ATTENDANCE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.365
INGRAINED ACROSS THE CITY WE

OUR MOBILE VACCINE SITES THROUGH

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.577
SACRAMENTO FIRE JUST GIVEN THAT

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:29.880
THEIR- THE THAT DEMAND REALLY-

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.982
FELL OFF. SO WITH THAT AND I

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:34.118
ANTICIPATE AS ADDITIONAL BOOSTER

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.086
SHOTS COME OUT WILL CONTINUE

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.121
THOSE EFFORTS ACROSS THE-

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.056
COMMUNITY. ONE THING I CAN SAY

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.625
THAT- IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.560
WE'VE SEEN AN UPTICK IN TRUST.

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:46.764
COMMUNITY WITH. I THINK MORE

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.232
COMMONSENSE COMMUNICATION TO ON

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.433
THAT IF THEY ARE NOT

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.901
EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OR JUST

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.703
WATER SYMPTOMS TO STAY HOME.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.605
DON'T OVER ONE THE HOSPITALS I

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:55.739
THINK WE'RE SEEING THOSE DIRECT

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:58.008
EFFECTS ACROSS THE COUNTY BY NOT

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:58.943
OVERWHELMING HOSPITALS AS WE IN

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.078
DURING THIS MOST RECENT WAVE. IT

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:02.980
SEEING THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.115
STAYING VERY LOW AMOUNTED TO

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.850
MONITOR THOSE VERY FREQUENTLY

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:07.751
AND WE'RE NOT SEEING THE UPTICK

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.653
THAT WE SAW DURING THE INITIAL

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.754
OMICRON VERY COMING OUT. IT'S

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.456
ALMOST AS A SLOW WAVE THAT WE'RE

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:14.558
SEEING HERE I THINK A LOT OF

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:15.826
THAT HAS TO DO WITH ADDITIONAL

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:17.361
COMMUNICATION AND BUILDING TRUST

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.196
IN THE PUBLIC AS- WITH OUR

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:22.232
FOCUSED EFFORTS. I NEXT JUST TO

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:23.834
SPEAK ABOUT TESTING WE'VE I

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.836

SMARTER PLAN OF THE STATE PLAN

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.868

SMARTER THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.853
THE PLAN. STILL SERVES AS A

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.988
USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR YELLOW

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:54.157
COUNTY AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE

THE SEVEN FOCUS. OF THE SMARTER

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:04.668
PLAN. MATH AWARENESS READY TO

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.737
CASTING EDUCATION AND TREATMENT

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.739
OR R. ACTS. LET'S BEGIN WITH

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.041
SHOT VACCINES ARE THE MOST

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:12.642
POWERFUL WEAPON WE HAVE AGAINST

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:15.345
SEVERE DISEASE HOSPITALIZATION

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.147
AND DEATH FROM COVERT NINETEEN.

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:20.217
INYO COUNTY 74% OF RESIDENTS

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:21.351
FIVE AND OLDER HAVE COMPLETED A

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:23.387
PRIMARY THEORIES OF THE COMPANY

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:26.356
BAXEEN. OVER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND

00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:27.858
DOSES OF VACCINE HAVE BEEN

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.226
PROVIDED BY YOLO COUNTY ITSELF

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.361
AS A VACCINE PROVIDER SINCE

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:33.797
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.665
ENVISION A FUTURE IN WHICH THE

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.033
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TAKES

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.902
OWNERSHIP OVER COVERT NINETEEN

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:41.805
VACCINATION MUCH LIKE IT DOES

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.074
FOR ANNUAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.876
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. AS MUCH

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:47.511
AS YOLO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.413
WOULD LIKE TO- DEMOBILIZE THEIR

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.415
COVERT ACTION NATION TEAM AFTER

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.717
A YEAR AND A HALF OF CLINICS WE

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.051
EXPECT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH WILL

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.686
PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:58.989
VACCINATING CHILDREN UNDER FIVE

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:01.391
LIKELY BEGINNING NEXT MONTH. I'M

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:02.959
GRATEFUL FOR THE INCENTIVES OF

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.227
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:05.896
PUBLIC HEALTH IS OFFERING TO

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:08.165
PROVIDERS TO VACCINATE CHILDREN.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:10.133
BUT HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.669
ENROLLMENT REMAINS WELL. THE

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.372
NEXT FOCUS AREA MATH IS ONE OF

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:17.641
THE MOST CHALLENGING. PROPERLY

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.509
WORN MASKS WITH GOOD FILTRATION

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.478
HELP FLOW THE SPREAD OF COVERT

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:23.980
NINETEENTH. WHEN THE STATE ENDED

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.582
ITS MASKING MANDATE IN MOST

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.517
INDOOR SETTINGS IN MARCH WE

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.052
TRANSITION TO STRONGLY

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:31.321
RECOMMENDING MASK. A STRONG

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:33.056
RECOMMENDATION WAS FRAMED AS

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:35.091
PART OF A CONTINUUM RANGING FROM

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:37.794
MATH OPTIONAL TO RECOMMENDED TO

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.696
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:42.365
REQUIRED. HOWEVER NO DETAILS

00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:44.034
HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS TO WHEN

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.769
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THESE LEVELS

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.871
WILL OCCUR. THIS LACK OF

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.639
TRANSPARENCY UNDERMINES

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.975
CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AT

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.810
THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THE

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.545
STATE HAS MAINTAINED A STRONG

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.247
RECOMMENDATION FOR MASKING SINCE

00:51:57.314 --> 00:52:00.650
MARCH FIRST. IN MARCH AND TODAY

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:02.118
THE CASE READ IN YOLO COUNTY HAS

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:05.255
RANGED FROM FOUR TO TWENTY ONE

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:06.456
CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.058
RESIDENTS PER DAY REPRESENTING

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:10.227
MODERATE SUBSTANTIAL AND HIGH

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:13.196
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IN TURN.

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.165
OF A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER MY

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.033
HANDS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY TIED

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.568
BY THE STATE'S APPEARANCE TO A

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.604
STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO MASK

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.106
EVEN IF CASE RATES PLUNGED

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.941
LOCALLY. WHEN THE LOCAL CASE

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.043
RATE WAS FOUR I WOULD HAVE LIKED

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.178
TO MESSAGE THAT MASKING HAD

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:30.881
BECOME OPTIONAL BUT I WOULD NOT

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.015
HAVE BEEN ALIGNED WITH STATE

00:52:32.082 --> 00:52:33.683
MESSAGING. WHEN THE CASE RATE

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.385
BEGAN RISING I WOULD HAVE

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:37.020
STEPPED UP MY RECOMMENDATION

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:39.122
ACCORDING TO TRANSMISSION RISK.

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.358
INSTEAD I'VE BEEN SAYING ALL

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:42.726
ALONG THAT MASTER STRONGLY

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.594
RECOMMENDED AND PEOPLE HAVE

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.163
STOPPED LISTENING. IF WE WANT

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.698
HE PUBLIC TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:50.767
PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING WE MUST

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.569
BE MORE NIMBLE AND ARE MASKING

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:55.205
RECOMMENDATIONS ADJUSTING THEM

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:57.440
AS THE RISK OF JOSH. I

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.042
UNDERSTAND THE CDPH OF

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.810
DEVELOPING METRICS FOR WHEN TO

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.646
INCREASE MASKING RECOMMENDATIONS

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.548
I WENT TO DECREASE THEM AND I

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:07.217
VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:08.318
RELEASE OF THIS MUCH NEEDED

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:11.354
FRAMEWORK. MOVING TO AWARENESS

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.089
THE SMARTER PLAN CALLS OUT THE

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:14.758
IMPORTANCE OF STAYING AWARE OF

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.693
HOW KOBE NINETEEN IS SPREADING

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.495
EVOLVING VARIANCE AND

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.530
COMMUNICATING CLEARLY HOW PEOPLE

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.499
SHOULD PROTECT THEMSELVES. THIS

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.901
LAST PIECE COMMUNICATING CLEARLY

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:27.537
IS AN AREA NEEDING ONGOING

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.005
ATTENTION AND INVESTMENTS. WE

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:31.274
HAVE OVER COMPLICATED MUCH OF

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:32.943
OUR CO THAT GUIDANCE AND ALSO

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:35.679
FAILED TO ADJUST THEM AS REF

00:53:35.745 --> 00:53:37.480
CHANGED OVER TIME. I ENCOURAGE

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:38.882
INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:42.052
COMMUNICATION AS PART OF READY

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:43.186
TO WHICH I'LL RETURN TO IN A

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:45.889
MOMENT. INYO COUNTY WE'RE

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.290
FORTUNATE TO HAVE TREMENDOUS

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.492
VISIBILITY INTO CIRCULATING STAR

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:52.529
KOBE TO VARIOUS. IN REAL TIME

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:54.397
THE UC DAVIS GENOME CENTER

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.733
GENOTYPES EVERY POSITIVE TEST ON

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.102
THE UC DAVIS CAMPUS AND THROUGH

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.438
HEALTHY YELLOW TOGETHER LARGE

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.273
COMMUNITY TESTING PROGRAM. WHEN

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.674
MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER COUNTIES

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.676
HAD ONLY SEEN DELAYED A WHOLE

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.745
GENOME SEQUENCING RESULTS FOR A

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.814
HANDFUL OF OMICRON CASES IN

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.083
JANUARY I WAS ABLE TO SAY THAT

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.851
ALL MICRON WAS ALREADY THE

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:15.986
DOMINANT VARIANT AND YELLOW

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:17.654
COUNTY WHICH ALLOWED OUR

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.823
PROVIDERS TO ADJUST THEIR

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:22.592
TREATMENTS ACCORDINGLY. NOW AS

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.294
UNREPORTED HOMES HAS BECOME MORE

FRAMEWORK- THAT HAS BEEN LATER

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.450

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.185
IT'S A GOOD FRAMEWORK FOR-

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.921
ADDRESSING COVERT GOING FORWARD

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:40.256
. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:41.691
TO BE DONE STILL- BECAUSE

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.359
THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WE-

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.696

SAP SUPPLY CHAIN- DISRUPTIONS-

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.279

YES SIR OUR VERY CLOSELY WITH MY

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.416
HOSPITAL COORDINATORS AND FROM

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.684
THE EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC I

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.722
MENTIONED THAT- THE INITIAL- THE

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:36.525
INITIAL. FIRST WAS IN NINE FIVE

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:38.594
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF OUR WILDFIRE

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.129
PREPAREDNESS FOR THE SMOKE

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.498
ACROSS THE COMMUNITY WE HAD.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.367
AMPLE AMOUNTS OF IN NINETY FIVE

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:45.634
AND WE DISTRIBUTE THOSE OUT WITH

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.003
THAT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING OF

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:48.971
PROVIDING THOSE IN NINETY FIVE-

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.740
MASS THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.742
NETWORK WE DEVELOP GOOD.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:54.377
ORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION I

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:56.345
HAVE NOT HEARD FROM MY HOSPITALS

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:59.448
IF THEY'RE THEY'RE SHORT ON THAT

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.117
I FEEL THAT THEY WOULD BE

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.618
CONFIDENT TO COME TO MYSELF OR

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.888
OUR- THE CITY. TO RECEIVE IN

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.790
NINETY FIVE IF THEY NEEDED IT- I

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.358
HAVEN'T HEARD AT LEAST IN

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.459
SACRAMENTO- YOU NEED OF CONCERN

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.763
ABOUT P. BUT- I DON'T WANT TO

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:14.530
SPEAK COMPLETELY FOR THE

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.798
HOSPITALS THEY MIGHT HAVE LIKE

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.032
YOU SAID SIR DEFERRED. YOUR

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.968
DURING- DURING DIFFERENT WAVES

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:22.171
THEY MIGHT HAVE SHORT SHORTER-

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.673
LIMIT ON PP BUT I HAVEN'T. HAD

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.942
ANY S. ANY ISSUES COME TO MY

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:30.913
ATTENTION. AND THE OTHERS. IN IN

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.248
YOUR COUNTY AYE MEET REGULARLY

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.483
WITH OUR HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP AND

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.485
I WOULD SAY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.387
COBIT WAIVES THE CHALLENGE WITH

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.555
CERTAINLY AVAILABILITY OF PP. I

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.991
THINK NOW THAT SUPPLY CHAINS ARE

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:44.226
ARE FLOWING OUT PROPERLY AND OUR

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.862
MOLOCH PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:49.765
AS SORT OF AS A AS A BACKUP IF.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.700
A HOSPITAL IS NOT ABLE TO ACT OF

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.803
P. P. A. I WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:54.537
CHALLENGE THAT OUR HOSPITALS

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.705
EXPERIENCED AND IN THE LAST WAVE

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:57.740
AND WITH THIS CURRENT INCREASE

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.909
IN IN CASE IF THE SCARCITY. IS

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:02.545
IN STAFFING IS NOT IN PP- R.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.947
MANY STAFF THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.515
INFECTED WITH OVER NINETEEN AND

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.884
HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO WORK

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.719
AND SO THAT IS THE BIGGEST

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.021
CHALLENGE CURRENTLY FACING OUR

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:13.956
HOSPITALS. YEAH AND I THINK THAT

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.090
STAFFING ISSUES SOMETHING I'VE

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.426
HEARD OVER AND OVER AND- IT'S A

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.161
BIG ISSUE IN PART OF IT IS

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:23.599
FUELED BY- WELL BEING. AFRAID TO

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.267
GO INTO THAT FIELD ANYMORE. AND

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.635
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.838
THAT ENVIRONMENT IS AS SAFE. AS

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.539
WE CAN MAKE IT AND THEY HAVE THE

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:33.209
PP THEY NEED TO BE FEEL

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.210
CONFIDENT. THAT THEIR JOB CAN BE

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.046
DONE AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:37.713
TO BE OVERWORKED. AND SO THAT'S

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.282
A THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE HERE IN

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:45.054
CALIFORNIA- SO THE- THE DOCTOR.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.623
JUST SAID YOU HAD BROUGHT UP THE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.824
ISSUE OF LOCAL HEALTH ADVISORIES

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:49.825
VERSUS STATE ORDERS. AND THE

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.194
FLEXIBILITY THAT THE COUNTIES

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:55.097
NEED. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:57.600
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTY

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.368
. DO YOU FEEL THAT THAT AT

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.703
RESTRICTION GUYS ARE BEING

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.738
AFFORDED THAT. AND THAT'S KIND

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.740
OF WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.475
STATE IS STILL DOING THE DOING

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.244
THE MAIN ORDER AND THEN THAT

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.880
COUNTIES ARE STUCK TRYING TO

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:12.081
IMPLEMENT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:14.149
REALLY SUITABLE FOR THEIR COUNTY

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.285
. IS CORRECT IS THAT DAY HERE

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.254
THAT RIGHT- IT'S A IT'S A

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.722
SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED AND NOT

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.123
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MASKING

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:23.025
PIECE THE CHALLENGE HERE WAS WAS

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:26.028
NOT HAVING A STATE ORDER PER SE.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.396
THAT WAS STRICTER THAN THE STATE

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:28.964
WE ARE TALKING RECOMMENDATION.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:31.333
SO THERE IS NOT- DOES THE SAME

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.436
LEVEL OF OBLIGATION FOR A COUNTY

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.638
STILL TO FOLLOW ITS STATE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.873
RECOMMENDATION AS THAT IS WHAT

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.708
THE STATE ORDER BUT I THINK THAT

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:40.809
THE CHALLENGES MORE ON

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:42.511
COMMUNICATION. AND ENSURING THAT

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.080
THERE IS A FRAMEWORK PLACE FOR

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:47.016
HOW WE CAN YOU. ABOUT MASKING

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.083
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I WOULD SAY

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.287
IN IN GENERAL- MANY COUNTIES ARE

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:54.690
APPRECIATIVE OF THE STATE'S. TO

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:55.925
ISSUE STATE ORDERS BECAUSE IN

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:59.361
MANY CASES. THERE IS NOT THE

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:03.399
STEP. QUEUE IS THOSE THAT'LL

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.767
LEVEL. RIGHT THAT THAT IS

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.735
SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.203
ABOUT WHY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.340
THAT IS- A LOT OF TIMES OF

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.242
SPECIAL SCHOOL BOARDS. THEY WANT

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.210
THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO GIVE

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.812
THOSE ORDERS SO THAT THEY CAN.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:17.913
THEY CAN BE COMPLIANT AND- AND

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.449
BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE IT'S NOT

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.818
THERE. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.654
CREATE THAT- SO WE HAVE TO FIND

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:26.989
BALANCE SO YOU GUYS STILL HAVE

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.824
THAT FLEXIBILITY YOU NEED.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.792
WITHOUT DOING THAT I'LL LET

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.995

TO WAS NOT GOING AWAY AND THE

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:29.958

TO DATE WITH OUR- UNDERSTANDING

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.811
THE SCIENCE OF IMMUNITY AND AT

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.646
THAT. WE HAVE A MINISTER OVER

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:00.449
SEVENTY MILLION DOSES OVER 75%

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.719
OF FIVE OF PEEPERS OF OLDER THAN

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:04.786
FIVE HAVE RECEIVED THE PRIMARY

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:08.090
SERIES IN OVER SEVENTY FIVE PER

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:10.359
OF PERSONS. OVER THAN SIX FIVE

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.427
HAVE RECEIVED BOOSTERS. IN TERM

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.730
OF OUR VACCINE ARE WE HAVE BEEN

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.365
ABLE TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.899
THE LOWEST THE LOWEST INCOME

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.501
AREAS AND THE HIGHEST INCOME

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.169
AREAS CURRENT THE VACCINE

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.205
COVERAGE GAP IS ABOUT EIGHT.

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.607
PERCENT BUT WE DO NEED TO WE DO

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:27.309
NEED TO GET IT OUT LOWER. IN

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:28.810
TERMS OF A VACCINE COVERAGE

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:31.346
COMPARING LEVINE AND AFRICAN

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:34.816
AMERICANS WHICH ARE ABOUT 958%

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.651
COMPARE THE Y. PA. WHAT'S PER

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:39.388
THERE'S A TEMPER. OUR COVERAGE

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.655
GAP THERE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:45.093
CONTINUE TO TRY TO CLOSE AS WELL

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.428
. THE NET CATEGORY THAT I'M

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.729
GONNA MENTION BRIEFLY IS ABOUT

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.664
MATH SO MASS REPRESENTS OUR

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.533
FOCUS ON PREVENTING AIRBORNE

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.268
TRANSMISSION INDOORS. THE

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.671
CONCENTRATION OF VIRUS AEROSOLS

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.240
. THE RISK OF INFECTION URSEL

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.008
CONCENTRATION INDOORS CAN BE

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.109
LOWERED BY INCREASING

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.278
VENTILATION FILTERING INDOOR AIR

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.580
OR DISINFECTING INDOOR AIR.

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.682
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE MASKED

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.818
WITH GOOD FIT INFILTRATION.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:12.487
CAN'T IF INFECTED DECREASE THE

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:13.855
AMOUNT OF VIRUS AEROSOLS THEY

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:16.491
RELEASE INTO THE INDOOR AIR. IF

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.293
THEY'RE NOT INFECTED THEY CAN

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.028
PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM INHALING

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.330
VIRUS AEROSOLS. BECAUSE MANY

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.632
INDOOR SPACES ARE POORLY

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:25.567
VENTILATED OR AIR THOUGHT

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:28.770
ADEQUATELY FILTERED THE ONLY. IS

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:32.541
TO WEAR GOOD MATH THIS IS MOST

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:33.608
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.177
ARE VULNERABLE AND IN THOSE

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.546
SETTINGS WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.281
TRANSIT. OR WHERE THERE'S A LOT

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:40.916
OF VOTER. PERSONS WE ARE LOOKING

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.317
AT WEAK WEEK WE CONTINUE TO

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.785
UPDATE UPDATE OUR MASKING

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.221
GUIDANCE AND LOOK AT THE LET THE

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:47.722
LATEST SCIENCE. WE'VE ALSO WE

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:49.591
ALSO WILL BE CONVENIENT INDOOR

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.726
AIR QUALITY TASK FORCE TO LEARN

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.028
HOW TO REDUCE INDOOR

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.763
TRANSMISSION AND TO IMPROVE

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.467
INDOOR. AIR QUALITY IN GENERAL.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.569

IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MAKING

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.635
TESTING AVAILABLE HAVE TESTING

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:43.071
FOR THE SCHOOLS. BUT THE X. NEWS

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:43.972
THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT HIS

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.941
ARE OFTEN SERVE SITES TO PROVIDE

SITES ACROSS. THE STATE. AND OF

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.623
COURSE EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.991
THE KEY THING THAT WE LEARNED

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:05.760
ABOUT EDUCATION. IS THAT WHEN WE

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.362
PUT EVERYTHING IN PLACE. THE

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.731
INTERVENTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL AT

FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE IS HOW

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.185
CARE THIS IS A E. M. SYSTEM. IS

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:19.821
THE HOUSE IS THE Q. CARE. THAT

MEASURE THAT. AND HOW WE'RE

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:51.766
LOOKING TO MAKE IT. MORE

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.668
EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD. HI

THIS IS DOCTOR ARE GONE SO THAT

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.472
THE KEY WHERE THEY WERE THE THIS

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:01.609
IS. THERE'S TWO TWO MAJOR WAYS

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:02.843
WERE DOING THE THINGS. ARE USING

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.112
WITH A HEALTHY PLACES INDEX THAT

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:06.781
COMPARES. DIFFERENT AREAS ACROSS

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.316
THE NIGHT I'M SORRY ACROSS

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.718
CALIFORNIA BASED ON- THE

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.653
RESOURCES MOSTLY IF IT HASN'T

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.989
HIGHER INCOME AND LOW INCOME.

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.891
AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUND

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:19.293
THAT. THAT WHAT WILL WHAT PEOPLE

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.363
REFER TO AS HPI HPI ONE IS THE

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.665
LOWEST INCOME H. P. I. TWO IS

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.634
THE NEXT LOWEST INCOME. H. P. I.

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:28.135
FOUR IS THE HIGHEST INCOME. WE

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.104
FOUND DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:31.806
THESE THAT THESE CATEGORIES WERE

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.407
THAT WERE AMONG THE STRONGEST

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:35.810
PREDICTORS OF THE COVE IT. A

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.645
CASE OF THE HOSPITALIZATIONS WE

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:38.913
ALSO KNOW THAT IT ALSO

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.048
CORRELATES WITH THE RACIAL AND

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:41.749
ETHNIC DISTRIBUTION OF

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:45.052
COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.388
BEEN WITH TERM OF DISTRIBUTING.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.890
DURING OUR CAMPAIGNS- IN MAKING

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.026
SURE THAT WE HAVE SITES WE

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.728
REALLY FOCUS ON CLOSING THE GAPS

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.596
BECAUSE IT WE DID OBSERVE. THAT

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.798
H. P. I. FOR WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL

01:33:57.865 --> 01:34:00.167
IN. AND HAVING HIGH COVERAGE AND

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.469
THEN WE INVEST A LOT OF

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:04.105
RESOURCES IN THOSE LOWER INCOME

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:07.341
AREAS H. B. R. ONE INTO TWO.

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.242
THAT EQUITY CAP. THE OTHER WAY

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.910
THAT WE FOCUS ON THAT WE ALSO

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.812
LOOK AT THE DATA- BY RACE

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:14.482
ETHNICITY. AND WE'VE WORKED WITH

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.784
OVER TWO HUNDRED- CBO'S ACROSS

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:17.885
THE STATE TO REALLY GET THE

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:20.021
MESSAGE OUT. ON A LOT HAS BEEN

01:34:20.087 --> 01:34:20.921
INVESTED IN THE IN THE PUBLIC

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.723
HEALTH CAMPAIGN TO GET FOLKS

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.759
VACCINATED FIGHTING- A MIS AND

DISINFORMATION HAS BEEN AN

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:28.529
IMPORTANT COMPONENT. THE LAST

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.364
SECTION I WANT TO ALSO MENTION

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.699
WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:33.734
EQUITY IS. IS WORKING WITH

ABLE TO GET KIDS IN SCHOOL AND

MAKE IT A SAFE POSSIBLE BECAUSE

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.645
FAMILIES WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:46.280

THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SAFE

IN SCHOOL. THAT'S BEEN AN

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:49.950
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EQUITY

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:55.523
PERSPECTIVE FROM A MENTAL.

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.657

LOCAL OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:19.700
ADEQUATELY STOCKED IN RESOURCE

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.268
TO BE WHEN THERE'S EVENTS THAT

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.337
ARE BEYOND. THEIR CURRENT

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:26.607
STOCKPILES THAT THEY HAVE.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.576
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I THE REALLY

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:29.443
THINGS IS TO ENSURE THAT AS

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.378
THEIR NEEDS FLUCTUATE AND

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:34.014
CHANGE- THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.283
SOURCE OF- OF- I HAVE TO GET TO

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:39.853
ACQUIRE THEIR PP FROM. AND AS

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.656
YEAR. I THINK HAVING A NORTH AND

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:45.960
THE SOUTH IS GREAT IF THE

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.595
COUNTIES ARE INVOLVED IN HAVE

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.629
THEIR OWN- SO THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:51.031
CHECK AND BALANCES BUT WE ALSO

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:55.002
HAVE TO ENSURE. THAT THOSE SOME

01:37:55.069 --> 01:38:00.007
THAT ARE WAY. ARE BEING. OUT AT

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:03.477
A KIND OF HAS A END DATE TO IT

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:05.980
AND- YOU DON'T WANT TO. A P. P.

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:08.215
E. THAT IS A OR YEARS THE SHELF

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:11.252
- GETTING SENT OUT AND- A LOT OF

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.953
TIMES THAT THAT TYPE OF THING

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:13.954
HOW DO YOU GUYS ENSURE THAT THAT

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:18.359
DOES NOT HAPPEN. I WE ARE

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:20.094
WINNING. IT'S A GREAT CAR.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.562
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A LIFE

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:24.665
CYCLE AND SO- WE ARE VERY

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.368
CLOSELY- THROUGH LIFE MANAGEMENT

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:31.805
TO TRY TO- MAXIMIZE- THE

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:32.873
DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE RESTORE.

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.775
MAKE A- AS A TO THE END OF THEIR

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:37.678
DATE- AND THEN PUSH THEM INTO.

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.580
FOR OUR REPURPOSE THEM INTO

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:42.650
OTHER AREAS- WHICH WE MAY NOT BE

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:44.184
ABLE TO USE- SUCH AS A BASED

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:47.388
BASE COVERING. AFTER IT'S NO

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:47.955
LONGER ABLE TO BE USED IN

01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:51.325
SURGICAL SETTING UP- THAT TOO WE

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.960
WOULD USE FOR OUR MAY. COMMUNITY

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.728
SO WE HAVE TO CLOSELY MONITOR-

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:57.731
EXPIRING. AND LOOK AT THOSE

01:38:57.798 --> 01:39:01.435
DATES- AND THEN- ALL- TO DO OUR

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:03.637
BEST TO. NOT HAVE TO NEXT AND

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.072
FIND THE RIGHT TARGET. TO MAKE

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:07.641
SURE THAT- AS A SHOCK ABSORBER-

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.943
WITHIN THE SYSTEM NETWORK. ON

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.878
THE LAST STICKING NATURE IN THAT

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.813
WERE RESPONDING. AND NOT RUNNING

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.016
SHORT AND NOT HAVING TOO MUCH SO

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.651
IT'S A- ONE WE ARE. ABOUT HOW TO

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:22.389
MAINTAIN- YOU KNOW CLOSE. OF

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.124
AWARENESS OF. THE FUTURE

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:26.093
PANDEMICS. THE RIGHT TARGET

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:29.530
WHAT'S BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED- AND

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.231
IT AND THERE THE SAME TIME. I

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:32.700
WILL SAY HOSPITALS NOW INCREASE

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:35.302
THEIR STORAGE. THE REGION'S OF

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:36.904
AGREE SIR STORAGE THE CALORIES

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.972
INCREASE OR STORAGE ALL OF THAT

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:42.409
EVERYBODY IS. RESPONDED SINCE-

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.311
TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE'S A- MUCH

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:49.850
BETTER- STOCKPILE OF SITUATIONAL

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.218
. AND I CAN. ACROSS THE BOARD

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.253
AND SO WE JUST MOVE FASTER NOW

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.222
THAT WE HAVE- AND HAVE IN THE

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:56.657
PAST AND IT'S JUST INCUMBENT ON

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:58.659
US TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:04.998
REGRESS- JANE. THAT KEEP THE

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.934
BILL THE FUTURE FOR. THE FUTURE

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.836
EVENTS ARE TYPE. RIGHT I THINK

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:11.505
THAT BUT SUBJECT IN ITSELF IS

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:13.907
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PROBABLY

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:16.744
HAVE A- BETTER DISCUSSION ON HOW

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.812
TO HANDLE GOING INTO THE FUTURE

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.080
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:21.615
WAYS OF. CHANGING THE WAY WE DO

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:24.718
THINGS TO BETTER MANAGE THIS

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:28.055
THIS. THIS TYPE OF SURGE THAT WE

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:29.690
GET NOW- AND GOING INTO THE

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:32.192
FUTURE BECAUSE OF- OF COVERT I

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:34.395
WANT TO SWITCH TO REALLY QUICK.

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:38.599
OF FACILITIES- RIGHT NOW THE

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:41.135
SEARCH FOR HOSPITALS IS HANDLE.

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:44.671
SOMETIME THE TENTS. OF SOMETIMES

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:46.840
WITH DELAYING PATIENT TREATMENT

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:50.043
FOR- WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.111
CONSIDERED TO BE ELECTIVE

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.679
SURGERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:54.715
AND IT REALLY DISRUPTS THE

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:57.251
MEDICAL CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

01:40:57.317 --> 01:41:00.554
AND I THINK. THE STATE HAS TO

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:04.224
TAKE A ROLE IN FIGURING OUT

01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:06.360
GOING INTO THE FUTURE HOW WE'RE

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.762
GOING TO HANDLE SURGE ON A

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:13.467
PERMANENT. BASIS. BYE BYE MAYBE

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:17.638
EVEN PART. AND HAVE HOSP CAMP.

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:21.341
THAT HAVE. A B. MS IS ONE ONE

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:24.244
PERSON WAS SPEAKERS I THINK IT'S

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:27.281
MISS BASSINET. SPOKE YOU KNOW

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:32.186
THE- NG WELL WE TO A- TO SOME OF

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:34.021
CAMPUS THAT CAN HANDLE. KOBE

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:37.090
WHEN IT SIR. AND THE STAY WRIST

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:39.626
OF. SHOULD BE TO ABLE TO GET

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:43.664
THOSE TYPE OF FACILITIES BILL.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.832
SO THIS THE HOSPITAL'S FOLK ON

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.834
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHICH IS TO

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.570
GROW THEIR COME. NOT SEARCH

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:51.405
COMPARE. FOR A- BECAUSE

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:53.373
OTHERWISE THEY GET SWITCHED INTO

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.176
DOING THAT AND THE COMMUNITY

01:41:56.243 --> 01:41:58.712
GROWTH FALLS BEHIND AND THEN

01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:01.014
THEY BECOME INADEQUATE- EVEN FOR

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:02.382
THEIR MOST BASIC SERVICES FOR

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.718
THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.253
SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.088
BE LOOKING AT GOING INTO THE

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:10.257
FUTURE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:10.924
A QUESTION IN THERE BUT- MORE OF

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:18.332
A THOUGHT PROCESS. YEAH OKAY

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:20.434
THEM WITH THAT I JUST HAD ONE

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:21.969
LAST QUESTION JUST CAME TO MIND-

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.871
WITH THE USE OF- OR I SHOULD SAY

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:26.139
THE HOME TESTS BECOME MORE

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:27.808
AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS PURCHASING A

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:28.942
KEVIN AMOUNT HOME DOES THE

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:30.644
SMARTER PLAN ACCOUNT FOR ANY

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:33.914
POTENTIAL- TESTED COME POSITIVE

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:35.883
OR NEGATIVE ON THAT I KNOW

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:37.017
THEY'RE GOING TO FROM HOME AT

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:39.052
DIFFERENT SO HOW DOES THAT

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.220
ACCOUNT FOR WITH THE SMARTER

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:42.823
PLAN YEAH THIS IS A VERY GOOD

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:44.525
QUESTION- IT HAVING THE

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.660
AVAILABILITY HOME TESTING IS SO

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:48.695
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:50.764
USED FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES IF

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.466
YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED IF YOU

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:54.701
DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. YOU CAN TESTER

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:55.969
SET YOU CAN TEST YOURSELF PRE

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:58.372
EVENT BEFORE YOU GO VISIT- TECH

01:42:58.438 --> 01:42:59.740
TO BEFORE YOU GO HAVE A SOCIAL

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.475
INDOOR GATHERING SO I THINK

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:02.876
IMPORTANT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:04.111
OF CONTESTS OF COURSE IS THAT

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:06.146
WHEN THEY TEST POSITIVE IT

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.281
DOESN'T END UP IN OUR

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.683
SURVEILLANCE. SO- BUT THE PEOPLE

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.685
CAN STILL USE THAT POSITIVE TO

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:14.521
GET TREATMENT THEY DO THAT-

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:17.224
POSITIVE TEST THE IT IN THE WILL

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.425
THEY WILL THEY WILL BE TO GET

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:20.294
TREATMENT AT THAT'S THE BEST WAY

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.431
TO THE- REALLY. PAULFOR ALL OF

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.667
US BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOU

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:27.801
WANT TO START TREATMENT AS SOON

SYMPTOMS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AT

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:33.407
RISK SO THE OTHER THING I JUST

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:34.975
WANT TO MENTION OF THE CHALLENGE

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:35.776
WHICH IS BECAUSE OUR

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:38.345
SURVEILLANCE. ARE BASED ON THE

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:40.013
CASE COUNT THAT WE HAVE ARE

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.015
BASED ON PRIMARILY THE PEOPLE

01:43:42.082 --> 01:43:44.184
PRIMARILY PCR TESTS THAT ARE IN

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.753
OUR SYSTEM SO THE CURRENT CASE

AMOUNT OF TRANSITION THAT'S

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.862
HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S PART OF

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.731
WHAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT

01:43:57.798 --> 01:43:59.633
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT- OUR OUR

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.468

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:17.490
. AND A PRESS PEOPLE AND IF IT

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:20.360
IS THE CITIZENS DO NOT ONE THIS

01:48:20.427 --> 01:48:23.964
THANK YOU. I EIGHT. THANK YOU

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:25.332
COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:27.868
COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'M NOT SURE

01:48:27.934 --> 01:48:29.603
IF THE SMARTER PLAN INVOLVES

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:31.438
MANDATING ANY TREATMENT OR

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:32.706
PURELY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THIS

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.674
REALLY CONCERNS ME AS A

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.142
CONSTITUENT AND THAT'S OUR

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:37.978
GOVERNOR IS AN ADVOCATE FOR

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:38.845
CHOICE I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:41.615
USE- BUSINESSES AS LIKE TO CALL

01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.083
THE POLICE FOR THE STATE-

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:44.985
BUSINESSES HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.386
ENFORCE MASS WITHOUT A STATE

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.855
MASS MANDATE AND THEY CAN ALSO

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.223
MAKE THEIR OWN PRIVATE POLICIES.

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.458
THAT CAN RESULT IN TRESPASSING

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:53.093
CHARGES FOR THOSE NOT WEARING

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:55.829
THE MASK I'M I'M MORE CONCERNED

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:56.630
THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:58.565
SUSCEPTIBLE TO A SPEECH

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.934
IMPEDIMENT RATHER THAN A VIRUS

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.435
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.537
NINETY NINE POINT 995% CHANCE OF

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:06.640
SURVIVING AND THAT MAKES ME

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.275
QUESTION WHY WE NEED THE

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.243
GOVERNMENT TO TELL US WHAT'S BAD

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.544
AND I THINK IT CLEARLY HAD DON'T

01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:13.613
WORK AND THERE'S NO SENSE IN IT

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.415
ESPECIALLY WHEN TWO WEEKS BECAME

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.450
MONTHS AND THEN YEARS. AND I YOU

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:18.985
GUYS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:20.553
ANSWER WHETHER THE STATE WAS

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.888
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:23.757
STATE YOU'RE NOT- WHAT KEEPING

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:25.125
PEOPLE SAFE WE ALSO MANAGED TO

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.526
CLOSE DOWN AROUND 36% OF OUR

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:28.762
BUSINESSES AND IT'S THE NUMBER

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:30.497
THAT HARD YOU KNOW GAVE US FROM

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:37.203

OF THE EXPERTS THAT CAME FORWARD

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.489
WAS ANY KIND OF EVOLUTION WITH

01:49:56.556 --> 01:49:58.024
THE SCIENCE IT'S COMING OUT

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.192
FIZER DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:02.162
DROPPING WE HAD ANOTHER EIGHT

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:03.430
EIGHTY THOUSAND PAGES DUMPED

01:50:03.496 --> 01:50:06.099
AFTER THEY WERE BASICALLY FEUD

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:07.334
WITH A FOUR YEAR RELEASED BY

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.803
DISCOVERED BOXING WAS NOT 95%

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:11.438
EFFECTIVE AS THEY CLEAN THE DATA

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:13.306
SHOWS THAT HAVE THE 12% EFFICACY

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:14.841
RATE FOR THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.776
AND THEN FAILED TO LEAD TO ONE

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:18.912
PERCENT. THAT'S IN THE DOCUMENTS

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.480
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING FROM ANY

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.415
OF THE PEOPLE THEY PROPOSED IT

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:23.550
IS BEING THE BEST SOLUTION

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:26.753
MOVING FORWARD AND HIGHLY

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.022

THEY WERE NO HE CLINICAL TRIALS

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.091
TO DETERMINE IF THE EXPERIMENTAL
