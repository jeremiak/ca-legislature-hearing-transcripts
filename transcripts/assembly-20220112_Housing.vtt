OF CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE
ELLIS ACT ON DOES IT CURRENTLY

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:08.784
AND AS I'M READING ANALYSIS
AND SEMI DOCUMENTARIANS IS

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:12.354
IT CURRENTLY ONLY APPLY TO
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RENT

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:17.192
CONTROL OR DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL
JURISDICTIONS FOR COMMONSENSE

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:21.029
A QUESTION -- FOR CALIFORNIA
NEEDED HIS MICROPHONE IS

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:25.067
THE MICROPHONE YOU SOME THE
GOVERNMENT CODE SEVEN SIXTY

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:29.571
DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE IT IS A
STATE WIDE AND CAN BE INVOKED

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:32.140
ANYWHERE AND I'VE SEEN IT
INVOLVED IN COUNTIES THAT DO

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:35.710
NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL BUT IT'S
RARE I MEAN THE REASON IT'S

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:41.183
INVOKED THIS TO PREEMPT LOCAL
RENT CONTROL GOT IT AND SO AND

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:44.052
DOES IT ONLY DOES THE ELLIS
ACT CURRENTLY ONLY APPLIED

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:47.522
TO RENT CONTROLLED UNITS OR
DOES IT APPLY TO ALL RENTAL

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:54.362
UNITS WELL IT APPLIES TO NEW
RESIDENTIAL UNIT OKAY THANK

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:57.132
YOU SO I SAW THAT YOU WERE
TAKING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

01:18:57.199 --> 01:19:01.336
ARE PROPOSED COMMITTEE MMS AT
LIMITED TO -- JUST ONLY UNITS

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:05.340
WITHIN A JURISDICTION THAT
HAS RENT CONTROL POLICIES IN

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:08.410
PLACE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S
CORRECT SO -- AND HAVE BEEN

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:12.180
REPORTED AFTER YOUR DESIRE AND
THE COMMITTEE'S DESIRE -- I

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:14.349
THINK WE'RE AT A POINT RIGHT
NOW THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.552
THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE REALLY
APPLIES TO ALL RENTERS ACROSS

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:21.056
CALIFORNIA -- WE SEAT MASS
INCREASE IN PRICES THERE'S

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:25.694
A LOT THIS UNDERLYING -- WHY
THAT IS -- BUT FOR -- YOU KNOW

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.630
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHERE YOU'RE
WANTING TO SEE A LIMITED TO

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:31.800
JUST EXISTING RENTAL AND TO THE
RENT CONTROLLED UNITS WITHIN

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:34.970
A JURISDICTION THAT ALLOWS
FOR RENTAL CONTROL -- IT'S

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.572
ONLY A SUBSET OF OF WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT -- TO REALLY TRY

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.741
TO ADVANCE THE PRINCIPLES I
THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:43.278
UNDER THIS BILL -- I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE SEEN IT YOU KNOW MOVE

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:45.647
FORWARD A LITTLE BIT PRODUCT
NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.484
MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY NOT
HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF LIVING

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:53.221
IN THE CITY -- WITH THOSE
PROTECTIONS OR I'D BE LIVING

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:56.024
IN A BUILDING THAT ARE SUBJECT
TO THOSE PROTECTIONS SO THE

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:59.094
LOOK AT THE LIMIT OF EARLY
FIFTY FOUR IS GOING TO BE ON

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:02.631
WHAT SOMEONE LIMITED -- SO IF
THAT IS SOMEHOW WE DON'T MOVE

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:06.168
THE BILL FORWARD AS AS AMENDED
-- BUT I JUST REALLY WANT TO

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:09.704
AGAIN COMMEND YOU FOR THE WORK
YOU'RE DOING -- I THINK YOU

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:12.474
KNOW TO A LOT WHEN I RECOGNIZE
YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:16.344
THAT MAKE -- INVESTMENTS THAT
COULD TAKE RISK ON THAT I I

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:19.181
BELIEVE ARE GOOD LANDLORDS
WHO WANT TO GET IN THERE AND

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:22.450
PROVIDE A MULTI UNIT HOUSING
FOR SO MANY THAT THAT NEED

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:25.187
ACCESS TO THE RENTAL MARKET I
ALSO COMMEND MANY OF THE GOOD

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:28.190
ACTORS THAT ARE OUT THERE --
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GETTING INTO

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:30.792
THIS OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MAKING A LONG TERM

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:34.829
INVESTMENT AND THE IDEA THAT --
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T LIVE WITH A

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:38.366
FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION ON ACTION
OF THIS NATURE DOESN'T SIT

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:41.703

COMING IN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:44.873

IS -- YOU KNOW ALL WITH STILL
WITHOUT WELL WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS

01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:01.356

THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH --

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:06.962

THAT HAVE EXPRESSED JUST BE
INCREDIBLE HURT FULL STORIES

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:33.481
OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY
THAT ARE BEING EVICTED OUT

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:36.584
OF THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE
ELLIS ACT OF MY COMMUNITY MY

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:40.221
DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST
GENTRIFYING AREAS WITHIN THE

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:43.525
CITY OF LOS ANGELES I HAVE
MET WITH RESIDENTS IN ECHO

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:48.029
PARK IN LINCOLN HEIGHTS IN EL
SERENO AND HIGHLAND PARK AND

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:51.766
ACROSS THE DISTRICT -- AND
UNDERSTOOD THEIR STORIES IN

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:55.303
TERMS OF HOW BECAUSE OF THIS
RAPID GENTRIFICATION IN MY

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:58.973
COMMUNITY FOLKS ARE COMING IN
THEY'RE BUYING UP BUILDINGS

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.042
THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE GONNA
KEEP THE RENTERS AND THEN

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:03.778
USING THE ELLIS ACT TO ACTUALLY
AFFECT THEM AND NOT HAVE THEM

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:06.981
RETURN I WILL SHARE A PERSONAL
STORY I USED TO BE A RENTER

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:11.019
IN HIGHLAND PARK SMALL LITTLE
ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT I WAS

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:14.956
PAYING NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
DOLLARS AND WHEN I MOVED OUT

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:18.660
THAT APARTMENT BEGAN TO RUN
FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:22.697
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
THAT I COULD HAVE AFFORDED THAT

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:25.834
RENTED MY OWN COMMUNITY AND
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF YOU'RE

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.304
TRYING TO SURVIVE OFF A LIVING
OF THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:33.241
CITY OF LA WITH THE INCREDIBLE
COST INCREASE TO A QUALITY OF

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:37.412
LIFE HOW INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT
IT IS TO LIVE IN THE CITY THAT

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:42.984
ONE HAS GROWN UP IN BECAUSE
OF THESE INCREDIBLE AS ARISES

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:47.188
IN IN RENT OR IS ACTUALLY MORE
EXPENSIVE TO RENT THEM TO EVEN

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:51.826
TO TRY TO PAY A MORTGAGE ON A
HOME SO IT'S THIS BACKWARDS WAY

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:56.264
IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE
SOLUTIONS TO AN INCREDIBLE

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:59.834
PROBLEM AND SO I JUST WANNA
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK I WOULD

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:02.804
LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A AS A CO
AUTHOR JOINT AUTHORS TO HELP

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.240
YOU ENSURE THAT THIS GETS OUT
OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ON TO THE

SENATE AND MOVES FORWARD AND
GETS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.211
BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE
TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:13.181
OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT
RESULT IN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:17.018
NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE
HAVE SOLUTIONS TO OUR HOUSING

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:21.489
CRISIS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:29.397
GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT IT BUT
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE WITH

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:35.203
THIS BILL IS HAVING COME FROM
AN AREA IN WORK AREA WHERE YOU

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:39.307
HAVE A LOT OF RENTAL HOUSING
-- A LOT OF IT IS PRETTY SUB

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:42.777
STANDARD IN A LOT OF IT IS
INDIVIDUALLY OWNED YOU'LL HAVE

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:45.780
SIX UNIT APARTMENT NINE UNIT
APARTMENTS THAT ARE OWNED BY

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:49.684
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW ELDERLY
THEY THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:53.955
WAY BACK YOU KNOW AND THE THE
FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THEY'RE

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:57.659
NO LONGER CAN TAKE CARE OF
THESE PROPERTIES -- AND FRANKLY

01:24:57.725 --> 01:25:00.929
THEY WERE FOR THE PROPERTIES
ARE FIRE TRAPS -- THEY NEED

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:05.834
TO BE REMOVED AND REBUILT AND
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.937
THAT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
WHAT THE MOM IN THE POT IT'S

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:12.207
GOING TO BE WITH A DEVELOPER
THAT COMES IN AND TAKES SIX TO

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:15.877
NINE UNITS IN WITH A DENSITY
BONUS LAWS IS ABLE TO PUT IN

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:19.314
TWENTY FIVE UNITS SO WHAT IT
DOES IT HELPS ON THE SUPPLY

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:22.016
SIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S
THE PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:25.420
ENOUGH SUPPLY IF SOMEBODY GETS
EVICTED THEY SHOULD BE EASILY

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:29.424
ABLE TO MOVE OVER TO ANOTHER
APARTMENT BUT THOSE APARTMENTS

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:32.293
DON'T EXIST AND THE REASON
THEY DON'T EXIST IS BECAUSE WE

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:37.565
MADE IT TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD
AND GET THROUGH A PROCESS IN

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:42.203
CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN RURAL
AREAS ARE NOT JUST IN SUBURBAN

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:45.773
AREAS BUT IN URBAN AREAS ALSO
WHEN YOU HAVE TO SPEND FOUR

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.877
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
A DOOR TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:53.081
UNITS THAT'S NOT AFFORDABLE
AND UNTIL THAT IS CORRECTED

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:56.417
WE CAN DO ALL OF THESE THAT WE
WANT IT'S NOT GOING TO FIX THE

01:25:56.484 --> 01:26:01.256
PROBLEM -- I FEEL SORRY FOR
THE TENANTS I FEEL SORRY FOR

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:05.493
THE OWNERS BROUGH BECAUSE WE'RE
WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.130
PICK SIDES INSTEAD OF WORKING
ON WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:13.501
AND THAT IS THE COST THAT IT
TAKES TO BUILD A UNIT YESTERDAY

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:16.804
I WAS SITTING IN A COMMITTEE
THEY PASSED THROUGH IN ORDER

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:22.176
ARE A -- THEY POTENTIAL BILL
THAT RAISES THE COST OF A

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:27.282
HOUSE BY THIRTY THOUSAND MORE
DOLLARS AS I AS YOU KNOW I

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:29.817
BROUGHT UP THE POINT YOU GUYS
YOU TAKEN FOR FOR HER FIFTY

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:34.355
THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR WE'RE

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:37.125
NOT GONNA GET WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO CATCH UP ON THIS PROBLEM IF

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:42.297
WE DON'T START FOCUSING MORE
ON THE SUPPLY ISSUE AND IN THE

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:47.535
PROCESS THAT'S RESTRICTING THAT
SUPPLY SO I APPRECIATE THESE

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:52.373
EFFORTS BY EVERYBODY TO TRY
TO ADDRESS THIS BUT KEEPING

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.944
PEOPLE IN SUB STANDARD HOUSING
BECAUSE YOU WE DON'T WANT THE

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:59.514
EVIL DEVELOPER TO COME IN AND
BUILD MORE HOUSING THAT IS

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:01.983
WHEN THEY'RE DONE BUILDING IT'S
JUST GONNA COST A LOT BECAUSE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:06.554
IT STILL ISN'T GOING TO HELP
THAT THAT -- RENT -- ISSUE

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:10.925
MY KIDS LIVE IN LA THEY RAN
THEY PAY WAY MORE THAN I DID

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:15.663
EVER FOR A HOUSE MORTGAGE --
IT'S IT'S TERRIBLE AND IN ITS

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.666
UP INCUMBENT ON US TO REALLY
LOOK AT WHAT THE REAL PROBLEMS

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:24.372
ARE WORK ON THOSE AND AND NOT
MAKE IT WORSE BECAUSE TO ME

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:28.242
THIS IS THIS IS RESTRICTING
PEOPLE FROM TAKING WHAT ARE

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:33.014
SUB STANDARD NINETEEN THIRTIES
AND FORTIES STRUCTURES AND

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:36.217
KEEPING THEM BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T GO THROUGH A PROCESS

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:40.021
TO IMPROVE AND UNFORTUNATELY
THAT PROCESS IS PEOPLE HAVE

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:44.092
TO MOVE OUT SO YOU CAN CLEAR
THE PROPERTY BUILD NEW AND BUT

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:47.562
THEY NEED SOMEWHERE TO GO WE
JUST DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:50.398
BY KEEPING THEM IN PLACE WHERE
THEY ARE IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:52.867
THAT PROBLEM EITHER IT'S JUST
GOING TO KEEP A SUB STANDARD

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:59.040
SIXTY NINE UNIT APARTMENT OR
A TOWN HOME OR CONDO IN PLACE

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:04.879
SO -- YOU KNOW FOR ME FOR ME I
HESITATE TO TO BE IN FAVOR OF

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:10.218
ANY BILLS LIKE THAT ARE TRYING
TO ADDRESS NOT THE PROBLEM

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:14.188
AND JUST MAKING IT SO THAT
WERE STUCK WHERE WE ARE SO --

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:17.025
I APPRECIATE IT THOUGH AND IT
AYE AYE WE DO AGREE WITH YOU

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.061
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE HAVE TO GET
A HANDLE ON THIS -- BUT I JUST

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:23.364
FEEL LIKE WE'RE ATTACKING THE
WRONG WRONG PLACE THANK YOU CAN

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.901
I RESPOND TO THE CHAIR -- IF
YOU COULD RESPOND ARE CLOSING

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:33.041
AND TO THE CLERK OF COUNCIL AS
THEIR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND MR

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:38.946
THANK YOU CHAIR REX OF THE
SOUNDS REALLY GOOD -- I REALLY

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:40.982
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.885
YOU KNOW MY MY FAMILY'S KIND
OF LIVED THE AMERICAN DREAM

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:47.255
IN MANY WAYS I WAS BORN INTO
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOW

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.757
NOT ONLY BE HOMEOWNERS BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE RENTAL PROPERTY

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.427
MOST OF WHICH ARE THERE GOES
A SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:58.800
OR SECTION EIGHT FAMILIES --
AND IT OVER ME THINK ABOUT

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:01.369
THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO
DO ON HOUSING THERE ISN'T ONE

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:03.671
THING THERE ARE MANY THINGS
THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:07.775
DOING THEM AT LEAST MAYBE NOT
AS FAST AS WE CAN OR SHOULD

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.278
BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY MOVING IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHETHER

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:13.514
YOU KNOW SB NINE IN TERMS OF
DENSITY INTERFILM EIGHTY USE

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:16.551
AND WE'RE TRYING -- BUT WITHIN
THE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT WE CAN

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:20.988
DO WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS --
AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:24.892
IS TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD ONE
STEP BACK WEHRUM ON THE ONE

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:29.230
HAND YES WITH THE BILL MORE
SUPPLY BUT WE'RE LOSING TENS OF

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:34.168
THOUSANDS OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL
UNITS AT THE SAME TIME -- A

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:38.673
AND SO GETTING YOU KNOW GETTING
AROUND THE INTENTION OF ELLIS

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.410
I GOT THE I SEE THIS IS AS
SOLIDIFYING -- THE UNDERLYING

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.778
INTENTION OF THE L.

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:46.914
SECOND ATTEMPT BUT IN
PROTECTING RENTERS AND THERE

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:50.251
IS NO EXCUSE -- ESPECIALLY
IF SOMEONE'S OWN PROPERTY FOR

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:53.554
DECADES TALK ABOUT THE VALUE
OF HAVING THAT PROPERTY IF THEY

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:57.525
WERE TRULY GOT IT DECADES AGO
-- YOU KNOW FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.894
SUB STANDARD HOUSING AND THAT'S
A PROBLEM WITH THE LANDLORDS

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:03.531
THAT THEY AND I KNOW THAT
THERE'S ALWAYS IMAGES OF YOU

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:06.534
KNOW THE THE LIKE TO BE PUT OUT
THERE OF ALL MODERN POPS WHAT

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:11.038
HAVE YOU -- BUT THE REALITY IS
THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROPERTY --

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:15.676
OF THE IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO ENSURE -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:18.846
NOT JUST COMPLY ONCE YOU HAVE
AN ABILITY BUT TO CREATE AN

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:24.886
ENVIRONMENT THAT -- IS NOT JUST
LIVABLE BUT IS QUALITY AND --

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:28.656
YOU KNOW THE THE THE ANECDOTAL
OF ALL THIS IS GOING TO KEEP

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:32.059
PROPERTIES ARE BEING FIXED UP
WHAT HAVE YOU -- THAT THAT'S A

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:34.495
DECISION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BY
THE LANDLORD AND THEIR PROFIT

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:37.298
MARGINS AND AND AND WHAT THEY
WANT TO SQUEEZE CENTER VENTURES

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:39.967
WE'VE SEEN THAT FAR TOO MUCH
AND IT GOES TO THE POINT OF

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:43.004
WANTING TO GET RENTERS OUT
SO YOU CAN BRING NEW VENTURES

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:46.374
AND AT MARKET RATES AND THAT'S
REALLY THE ULTIMATE SQUEEZE

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.978
THAT -- YOU KNOW AGAIN THE DAY
IS A DEBATE BETWEEN LANDLORDS

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:55.249
AND TENANTS POSSIBLY IF WE HAD
TO PICK A SIDE I'M GONNA PICK A

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:58.186
SIDE OF THOSE THAT WE COULD END
UP HOMELESS -- THESE ARE NOT

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:02.323
NORMAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
OR AGREEMENTS WAS JUST THINKING

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.660
ON BUYING A SANDWICH FROM YOU
HERE'S A RECEIPT WE'RE TALKING

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:11.732
ABOUT SOMEONE'S HOME IT'S WHERE
THEY LIVE AND -- YOU KNOW THAT

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:17.071
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND -- I
CONTROL HOMES IN LA THEY'RE

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:22.076
GONE NOW -- THAT'S A THAT'S
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:26.480
-- FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE TO
FIND HOUSING FOR -- IN IN AN

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:30.017
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE MARKET
AS EVERYONE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:34.922
AND SO -- I COME I COMMEND
YOU AND I WOULD LAS YA SE IS

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:39.594
EVEN THE OPPOSITION IN THE
-- STATEMENT ADMITS IT'S A A

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.364
VERY SMALL NUMBER AN EXTREMELY
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF ACTIONS

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:47.001
THAT THAT'S THE CASE THE MOST
THE BIG DEAL IT IS TRULY A SORT

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:51.873
OF EXTREMELY SMALL -- IT WHAT
I WOULD SAY ON THE ONE HAND

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:54.942
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL OF THIS
WAY OF STREAMING SMALL BUT TO

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.212
THOSE THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED
BY IT THE CHANGES OUR WHOLE

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:02.450
LIFE AND SO ON THE ONE HAND
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:05.953
OVERLY BURDENSOME ON THOSE THAT
TRULY -- HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.223
IN TERMS OF RENTERS ARE --
BUT LANDLORDS AND AND BUYING A

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.727
PROPERTY -- BUT IT CAN BE LIFE
CHANGER FOR THOSE OTHERWISE

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:15.930
WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT A HOME
AND SO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT IT

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:19.533
AND WOULD LIKE TO JOIN AS A
PRINCIPAL AUTHOR -- IF IF THE

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.738
AUTHORS -- PREFERENCE THANK
YOU MISTER KALRA ANY OTHER

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:26.307
QUESTION OUR CINEMA QUICK SILVA

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.514
CAN ON A QUESTION OF THE
AUTHOR IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:38.119
THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU DID
TAKE YES I AM HAPPY TO EXPLAIN

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:41.522
THAT SO WE TOOK THE AMENDMENT
TO LIMIT THE SCOPE ONLY TO

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:44.692
RENT CONTROLS OR SECTIONS AS
OUR CAL EXPLAINED SO NOW THIS

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.895
WOULD ONLY AFFECT TWENTY ONE
OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:50.865
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE I WISH

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:54.335
YOU WERE BROADER SENSE I THINK
BY A SPECIFIC TARGET THE MOST

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:57.571
NORMAL RIGHT NOW FOLKS WHO ARE
RENT CONTROLLED UNITS RIGHT NOW

01:32:57.638 --> 01:33:00.675
IS THE -- THE SPURNING APPROACH
AT THE MOMENT SO THAT'S THE

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:03.244
KIND OF THAT SEEMINGLY TOOK

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:08.316
SO THE COMMENTS THAT -- I
AM I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR ARE

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:15.356
MIXED IN THE SENSE THAT -- THIS
DECISION ON THE ALICE ACT IN

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:18.926
THE CHANGES YOU'RE BRINGING
FORWARD IS NOT JUST A ONE

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:22.797
YEAR DISCUSSION I WAS HERE IN
TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:26.767
TIME WAS VERY DIFFERENT AT
THIS TIME THE HUGE DIFFERENCE

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:31.639
THAT I HAVE SEEN UNDER HOUSING
JUST AS A WHOLE IS OF COURSE

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:35.109
THE SPECULATOR MARKET NOW
IF YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:38.312
ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO AND EVEN
WHEN I WAS ON COUNCIL IT WAS

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:42.316
A VERY DIFFERENT TIME AND TWO
THOUSAND FOUR TWO THOUSAND

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:45.920
EIGHTEEN TWELVE WHEN I SERVED
WE WEREN'T EVEN TALKING ABOUT

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:48.789
HOMELESSNESS ON THAT SO SOME
OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVED ON

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:53.894
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL KNOW THAT
BEFORE OUR EYES WE HAVE SEEN

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:58.733
ONE OF THE WORST CRISIS IS OF
OUR TIME AND THAT IS LITERALLY

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:01.402
PEOPLE NOT ONLY LIVING ON
THE STREET THAT ARE HOMELESS

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:05.940
BUT ARE DYING ON THE STREETS
SO AS A LEGISLATOR I HAVE TO

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:10.911
TAKE IN WHAT I CONSIDER PASSED
INFORMATION PRESENT AND THEN

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:15.516
LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND AS
MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAY

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:19.286
ARE TO ASSESS SOME OF WHAT HE
SAYS REALLY DOES MEAN SOMETHING

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:25.092
WHICH IS WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW
TO BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS AND

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:28.529
ARE THEY REALLY AFFORDABLE IF
WE CAN'T GET THIS PRODUCTION

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:32.733
MOVING AND WE COULD SPEND ALL
DAY AND WE DID SPEND MANY MANY

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:39.206
DAYS OVER THE -- RECESS TALKING
ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:41.642
WITH HOUSING PRODUCTION BECAUSE
THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:45.546
WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET
TO START TO SEE SOME TYPE

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:48.749
OF MARKET RATE AFFORDABILITY
IS BY HAVING THAT SUPPLY AND

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:54.221
DEMAND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
WAS A VERY MEASURED POINT ON

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:57.091
ONE OF THE TOWARDS WAS THAT
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE SITTING IN

01:34:57.158 --> 01:35:03.064
RENTAL UNITS MARKET RATE NOT
NECESSARILY AFFORDABLE THAT

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:06.400
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN THE
HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE THEY

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:09.503
HAVE TO SALARIES MAY BE WELL
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:11.939
THERE AREN'T THE UNITS FOR
THEM TO MOVE INTO AND THEY'RE

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:16.277
HOLDING THOSE UNITS WHICH
THEN -- PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTED

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:19.814
COMING OUT OF COLLEGE TRYING
TO GET IN THERE MOVED OUT OF

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.917
THOSE UNITS BUT IN THIS CASE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:28.889
UNITS I DID HAVE A MEET WITH A
FEW PEOPLE OF DISCUSSED IT AND

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:32.560
LIKE I SAID ON THE SPECULATOR
MARKET ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:36.530
NOT JUST SEEN IT AND RENTALS
OR SEEN IT AND HOUSING SOME

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:40.134
OF OUR SHOWS I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WATCH BUT I KNOW A GOOD

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:43.571
DECADE DECADE AGAIN I STARTED
WATCHING I THINK IT WAS SIX

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:46.373
OR UPPER OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.111
KIND OF A FUN SHOW AND I DID
TO MAGNOLIA HOMES OR WHATEVER

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:53.814
THEY'RE DOING IN OTHER PARTS
OF THE COUNTRY AND THEN THEY

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:57.918
SELL IT FOR PROFIT THIS ALL
SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW BUT OUR

01:35:57.985 --> 01:36:03.591
ISSUE IS THAT AS OUR SUPPLY
IN CALIFORNIA SHRINKS THIS NOW

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:08.562
EVEN WITH GREAT INTENTIONS IT
REALLY STARTS TO LIMIT FOR OUR

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:12.867
ENTRY LEVEL BUYERS SO I WILL
BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO GET

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:18.973
TODAY I DO HAVE CONCERNS --
BUT THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:24.078
IS EXASPERATED A PROBLEM THAT
WE SEE BEFORE OUR EYES THAT WE

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:27.948
CAN NOT A RACE NO MATTER WHAT
WE WANT TO SAY WE HAVE A TENT

01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:32.186
CITY NOW OUTSIDE ON FOURTEENTH
STREET ON THE PERIMETER OF OUR

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:37.658
CAPITAL THIS IS NOT HERE EVEN
IN NOVEMBER OR WHEN WE ARE IN

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:43.731
RECESS AUGUST SO THIS IS NOT AN
EXAGGERATION IT'S WHAT WE SEE

01:36:44.131 --> 01:36:47.434
AND THE GREAT COUNTY OF ORANGE
COUNTY WHICH WE PRIDE OURSELVES

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:51.672
ON BUSINESS AND TOURISM WE
HAVE OVER THIRTY PEOPLE DYING

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:55.209
A MONTH ON THE STREETS OF
ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE TO DO

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:59.346
BETTER AND IF THIS AT LEAST CAN
KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE THAT ARE IN

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:04.318
THOSE UNITS THAT IS SOMETHING
I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT ON THE

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:07.955
OTHER HAND AS A TEAM HERE AND
IN OUR BUILDING WE HAVE TO

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:11.692
FIGURE OUT HOW TO CUT OUT ALL
THESE BARRIERS TO PRODUCTION

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:17.264
AND GET BUSY BUILDING BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT THANK YOU

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:22.169
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:27.274

LIKE TO CLOSE AND FEEL FREE
TO DRESS YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.713
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE
ROBUST CONVERSATION I REALLY

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.150
DO ENJOY -- A DEBATE ABOUT IT
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:39.787
THINGS IS THAT UNDER THIS BILL
REFLECTIVE OF A COMPROMISE

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:42.423
THE LONG TERM LANDLORDS SAY
WHO OWNED PROPERTY SINCE THE

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:45.626
NINETEEN FIFTIES OR NINETEEN
SIXTIES STILL CANALSAT CAN

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:48.195
STILL USE THE ELLIS ACT THE
FIVE YEAR HOLDING PERIOD

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:51.165
ONLY APPLIES A FIVE YEARS OF
OWNERSHIP NO MATTER WHEN THAT

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:53.801
STARTED COULD BE NINETEEN FIFTY
FIVE COULD BE TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:57.271
AS LONG AS IT'S FIVE YEARS YOU
CAN STILL USE THAT RIGHT --

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:59.940
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REBELS
ACT TO LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:02.343
SO WE BUILT THAT INTO THE BILL
TO MAKE SURE THAT A LONG TIME

01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:05.646
LANDLORDS WHO PERHAPS IN THE
CASE WHO ARE AGING OUT AND CAN

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.948
NO LONGER TEND TO THE RENTAL
PROPERTIES THAT'S FINE THAT'S

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.951
OKAY THE STILL CAN USE ALSO
ACT AND IF THIS BILL WERE TO

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:14.555
PASS THE STILL ARE FREELY ABLE
DO THAT THIS BILL IS TARGETED

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:18.726
TOWARDS PROPERTY SPECULATORS
WHO IN VERY RECENT HISTORY

01:38:18.959 --> 01:38:22.463
BY A PROPERTIES IN WITHIN THE
FIRST ONE TO FIVE YEARS FOR

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:25.799
THEM LIKE THAT I REMEMBER WHEN
THE FLIP UNITS LIKE THAT IT

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:29.570
DOES NOT CREATE A NET NEW UNITS
THERE ARE NO NEW UNITS YOU'RE

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:33.774
CONVERTING A FORMER UNITS TO
MARKET RATE UNITS SO IN EFFECT

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:36.644
THAT WORSENS THE HOUSING CRISIS
UNFORTUNATELY AND I AGREE

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.313
WITH YOU I THINK THE IDEAL
WORLD IS WHERE WE A PLENTIFUL

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:42.316
SUPPLY WHERE IF SOMEONE WERE
UNFORTUNATE DISPLACED AND HAD

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:45.052
TO MOVE OUT FREELY AND EASILY
BE FIND ANOTHER PLACE OF

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:47.921
COMPARABLE STANDARD COMPARABLE
PRICE BUT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:50.858
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW SO
THIS MEASURE IS NOT INTENDED

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:53.727
TO BE PRODUCTION MEASURE BUT
IT IS A DEFENSE MEASURE DEFENSE

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:57.331
AGAINST INCREASING HOMELESSNESS
THE GRANTING EVICTION AND ALSO

01:38:57.398 --> 01:39:01.568
CLARIFIED UNDER EXISTING LAW
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S SOME --

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:04.805
MISINFORMATION OUT THERE UNDER
EXISTING LAW UNDER AB FOURTEEN

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.807
EIGHTY TWO WHICH WAS PASSED
THE COUPLE YEARS AGO BY OUR

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:11.478
PREVIOUS HOUSING CHAIR -- THE
INTENT TO OCCUPY RESIDENTIAL

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:15.482
PROPERTY BY THE OWNER OR THEIR
FAMILY IS STILL A NO FAULT JUST

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:19.053
CAUSE EVICTION AND WE INTEND
TO DEMONSTRATIVE CENSURE MODEL

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:22.289
RISEN TO PROBABLY SO SAVY THAT
FAMILY SOMEONE TO HOLD ON TO

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:24.958
THE SUB STANDARD UNIT AND THEY
WANT TO REMODEL IT THEY COULD

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:28.762
STILL UNDER EXISTING LAW VIC
FOLKS TO REBUILD -- BUT STILL

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:31.598

I THINK THE RESULTS -- SPREAD
THE SMALL MOM POOR MOM POPS

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.112
WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS
EXPLOITATION BY VERY LARGE

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:47.915
ACTORS AND I CAN'T REALLY
IMAGINE IN THE POST TWENTY

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:51.685
EIGHTEEN WORLD OF MANY SMALL

TO BUY A PROP IS A QUICKLY I
WE WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS

01:39:57.524 --> 01:40:00.494

TENANTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
TENANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:06.600
ARE NOT FACING THE REALITY OF
HAVING TO SLEEP ON THE STREETS

LIMIT THE USE OF THE OIL SECTOR
THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:30.124

RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS BUT
ALL TOO OFTEN WE DO KNOW THAT

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:41.635

REAL ESTATE BUYERS WHO BUY A

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.571

THIS I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
RETHINK THE SPACES AND STARTERS

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:55.329
RESTED NUMBER OF ISSUES OUT
THERE AND SO THESE AT INCIDENT

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:58.465
DOLLARS IDENTIFIED IN THE
LEGISLATION WILL GIVE LOCAL

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:01.134

AT LARGE TOOLBOX OF SOLUTIONS
AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER --

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:20.187
I THINK SMALL OF PIECES THAT
DISCUSSION AS WELL I HAVE A

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:23.390
LOT OF DENSITY IN MY DISTRICT
AND OTHER THAN BROWN FEELS --

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:25.659
THE ONLY OTHER SPACE BECAUSE
THERE TO LOOK AT OUR THESE

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:30.664
UNUSED GOLF COURSES I WALKED

THE SISTER TO RETHINK BOTH ARE
HOUSING REQUIREMENTS IN OUR

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:47.814
OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR
VERY PARK OR IN MY COMMUNITY

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:51.151
THERE'S A GOAL BY THE GOVERNOR

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:54.087
ATTEMPTS TO SET ASIDE THIRTY
PERCENT A WILDLANDS COASTAL AND

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:57.124
LAND AND WATERS AND OPEN SPACE
TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S EVERY

01:44:57.190 --> 01:45:00.093
CITY -- AND I THINK OPENING
OUR GOLF COURSES TO INCLUDE

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.462
OPEN SPACE AS A WAY TO HAVE
A RETHINK THAT IN THE URBAN

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:06.633

ORANGE COUNTY -- WE ARE STRONG
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL AND AND

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:49.543
VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY
WOMAN FOR ARE MOVING FORWARD

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:53.180
WITH THIS IDEA -- SO CITIES IN
COASTAL CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:57.884
FOR SITE TO ACCOMMODATE ARENA
NUMBERS INCLUDING THE MUCH

01:45:57.951 --> 01:46:01.021
LARGER REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE
GOTTEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:04.691
-- ESPECIALLY FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING -- AND YET WE HEAR FROM

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:07.694
CITIES ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW WE
CAN'T WE CAN'T BUILD WERE BUILT

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:11.364
OUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY LAND WELL
HERE'S THE LAND AND IT'S REALLY

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:14.201
IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDERED
THE CITY ON SITE BECAUSE ONE

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:17.504
OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO
REDUCE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:21.074
HOUSING YOU KNOW THAT THE COST
PER DOOR IS TO USE PUBLICLY

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:25.145
OWNED SITES -- ANOTHER BENEFIT
IS THAT GOLF COURSES ARE LARGE

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:28.048
PARCELS AND WE CAN INTEGRATE
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:31.451
A LARGER HOUSING AND OPEN
SPACE PLAN TO CREATE NEW

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:35.255
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE RIGHT NOW --
CITIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:37.624
YOU KNOW SITE BUT THEY OWN SOME
OF WHICH ARE LIKE YOU KNOW IN

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:40.727
INDUSTRIAL AREAS THAT YOU KNOW
I MEAN WILL USE THEM IF WE HAVE

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:44.131
TO BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO
HAVE YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:51.104
ABLE TO CREATE A NEW COMMUNITY
AROUND OPEN SPACE AND THAT'S

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:54.040
WHAT A GOLF COURSE GIVES YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO -- I WAS

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:56.009
A PLANNING COMMISSIONER FOR
THREE YEARS IN THE CITY WHERE

01:46:56.076 --> 01:47:00.714
I LIVE AND -- THE PROJECT WHERE
WE FACE THE MOST OPPOSITION AND

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.316
WHAT COUNCIL WAS RELUCTANT TO
MOVE FORWARD WERE ONES WHERE

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:05.986
THEY SAID OH YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WE

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:09.723
HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SEEN LEADS

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.826
CITIES TO START THAT PROCESS
TO START PUTTING FORWARD THOSE

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:15.195

GET THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:21.201
THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE
TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE WANT

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:24.104

TO EXISTING LAW THERE'S NO

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:02.269
DISCUSSION ANYWHERE IN THE
ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHOR AND

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:04.638
THE CONVERSION OF PUBLICLY
ON GOLF COURSES THE HOUSING

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:08.074
DEVELOPMENT DIVISION BY THE
BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE EXTENT

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:11.444
PARK PRESERVATION ACT OF
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IT WOULD

01:49:11.511 --> 01:49:15.582
VERY LIKELY LEAD TO WHAT THE
STATE PASSED LIKELY NEED TO

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:18.351
YEARS OF LITIGATION WHICH WE
BELIEVE WILL LIKELY RESULT

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:23.223
EXPECTED NOTIFICATION OF IT SIX
SEVENTY TWO THE STAFF ANALYSIS

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:26.626
POSITS THE CONCLUSION THERE'S
NOT SUBSTANTIAL PRESIDENT THE

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:29.696
COMMERCIAL GOLF COURSES TO
OTHER USES IS BECAUSE THE PARK

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:32.699
PRESERVATION ACT THERE'S BEEN
A SUBSTANTIAL BAR UNDERSTOOD

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:36.870
IS ONE OF SINCE NINETEEN
SEVENTY ONE SPECTER'S FISCAL

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:40.307
AFFECT THE MOST RECENT JANUARY
DRAFT OF THE BILL HAS DROPPED

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:43.343
A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PRICE
TAG PRIOR SEPTEMBER NINTH

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.713
DRAFT AS NOW DRAFTED THE BILL
GIVES NO IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.482
THE BILL'S INTENTIONS THAT'S
SOMETHING BLANK TO BE FILLED

01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:53.820
IN LATER YES -- AS WE AND I
MIGHT ADD MANY THIS APOLOGIES

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:56.823
LONG GOLF COURSES THANK
LIKELY THE PARK RESERVATION

01:49:56.890 --> 01:50:00.226
ACT APPLIES ANY PROCEEDS FROM

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:03.363
MORE THAN EATEN UP BY THE PARK
RESERVATIONS ACT REQUIREMENTS

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.799
THE PROCEEDS OF THE TRANSACTION
WOULD HAVE TO BE USED BY THE

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:09.202
CITY'S REQUIRE SUBSTITUTE PARK

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.739
OF FIVE THE PUBLIC RESOURCES
CODE REQUIRES IN QUOTE BY

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:15.575
GENERALLY THE SAME PERSONS
USE THE EXISTING PARK LANDS

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:19.346
OF CELERY ALTHOUGH MANY AND
WE DO AGREE INTERPRET THAT TO

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:22.282
MEAN THAT A RECREATIONAL USE
ANOTHER COPY SATISFIES THE

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:25.785
REQUIREMENTS MURSCHEL HANDLE
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS DOES

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:29.356

ONE OF THEM THANK THE AUTHOR
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD OUT

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:05.998
NOTHING THAT I SEE HERE IN
THIS BILL IS COMPELLING THE

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:09.602
-- THAT OF THE CLOSURE AND
RE USE OF OF GOLF COURSES BUT

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:12.305
RATHER AT LEAST THE CONTROL TO
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:00:12.371 --> 02:00:14.974
OWNED THE GOLF COURSES AND WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IS SETTING UP AN

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:17.310
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP INCENTIVIZE
THEM TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:20.813
EASIER TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION
HAPPEN WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.482
REALLY TRAINING THIS TOWARDS
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE KIND OF

02:00:23.549 --> 02:00:27.753
FOR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT -- LOW
INCOME HOUSING ON SITE AS WELL

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:30.790
AS PRESERVATION OF OPEN SPACE
AS WELL I THINK IT'S A REALLY

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:32.959
-- TAILORED WAY THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOR

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:35.328
USE THINGS THAT ARE PROBABLY
FEELING OR OTHERWISE UNDER

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:38.264
PERFORMING -- THAT JUST GIVES
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ANOTHER

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:40.967
TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX SO THANK
YOU FOR THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:46.872
MOVE THE BILL YOU MUST WHERE
NECESSARY TO I THANK YOU SIR

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:49.609
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IN FACT
I KNOW A COMMUNITY THAT IS

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:52.745
HAVING A GOLF COURSE LOOKED AT
BY A DEVELOPER TO DO EXACTLY

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:55.681
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S
A PRIVATE COURSE THOUGH AND

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:59.952
IT STRUGGLING -- WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT IS MUNICIPAL

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:03.789
COURSES GOVERNMENT ON COURSES
CITY OWNED OR WHATEVER A LOT

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:07.026
OF THOSE COURSES ARE LOCATED
IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE OTHER

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:09.762
BILLS THAT ARE SAYING HEY WE
DON'T WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.965
BUILT THERE BECAUSE IT'S NEAR
FREEWAY FOR ITS NEAR TRANSIT

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:15.735
QUARTER THAT -- THERE WHICH
IS A HIGH DENSITY A LOT OF

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:21.974
-- -- -- WHAT THEY THINK WILL
MAKE IT WORSE FOR FOLKS THAT

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:27.413
LIVE IN THOSE AREAS -- HEALTH
WISE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:33.352
ALSO FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE
EFFORT TO FIND SOMETHING FOR

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:38.491
OUR USE ESPECIALLY IN INNER
CITIES TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:44.063
-- JUST SITTING AROUND -- JUST
NOT HAVING ANY RECREATIONAL

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:49.602
OPPORTUNITIES AT ALL I'VE
SEEN A HUGE EXPANSION IN THE

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:53.439
AMOUNT OF KIDS THAT ARE BEING
INVOLVED IN GOLF SEEMS LIKE

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:56.609
EVERY HIGH SCHOOL NOW HAS A
GOLF TEAM THEY DIDN'T USED TO

02:01:56.676 --> 02:02:02.548
HAVE THAT AND AND I'VE HAD AN
COMMUNITIES HAVE THE ABILITY

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:07.653
TO DO THESE CONVERSIONS IT'S
NOT NECESSARILY YOU DON'T NEED

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:11.957
A GRANT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO
DO THAT ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HELP

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:15.327
IF THEY EVER GET TO THE PART
WHERE THEY HAVE FEES BUT WHEN

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:20.332
YOU TAKE THE PRACTICALITY OF
TAKING A LARGE OPEN SPACE AREA

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:25.237
AND THEN TURNING IT INTO HIGH
DENSITY -- ESPECIALLY IN IN

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:28.841
THERE IS THE INNER CITY AREAS
THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:34.580
-- OF OF HAVING THE -- MASTER
PLANNED COMMUNITY CONCEPT

02:02:34.647 --> 02:02:38.517
DOWNTOWN BUT WE IN MASTER
PLANNED COMMUNITIES YOU'LL

02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:40.920
NEVER GET PAST SEQUEL C.

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:46.125
WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TYPE OF
DENSITY TO BE ADDED IN TO WHAT

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:51.230
WAS ALREADY APPROVED BUY A CD
FOR MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITY

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:56.469
SO THE INFRASTRUCTURE IT THAT'S
BUILT IN IT IS NOT BUILT TO

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:59.939
HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND
IT'LL NEVER GET TO SEE WHAT

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:04.510
UNLESS WE CREATE MORE SEQUEL
EXEMPTIONS FOR THOSE THINGS

02:03:04.577 --> 02:03:07.279
AND THEN YOU'RE DEFEATING THE
PURPOSE OF SEQUEL IN THE FIRST

02:03:07.346 --> 02:03:13.385
PLACE SORRY EVERYTHING WE'RE
DOING IS IS IT SEEMS COUNTER

02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:16.789
INTUITIVE TO SOME OF THE THINGS
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:20.259
I KNOW THAT I'VE THE GOOD WILL
OF OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:24.630
I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT
THE PROCESS IS WHAT'S KILLING

02:03:24.697 --> 02:03:29.368
THIS PROJECT THAT I KNOW THAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THEY HAVE

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:32.538
THE BACKING THEY HAVE THE THE
FINANCES THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:35.775
THE PROCESS THEY CAN'T GET
THEIR SEQUEL AND THEY'RE NOT

02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.577
GOING TO NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD
OUT PROJECT SO WHAT IT'S GOING

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:42.014
TO BE IS A BUNCH OF VACANT
LAND WHICH LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:46.719
OKAY WITH VACANT LAND BUT YOU
KNOW UNTIL WE ADDRESS THOSE

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:50.856
OTHER THINGS GRANTS ARE FINE
BUT IF IF WE DON'T IF WE

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:56.428
DON'T FIX THE PROCESS THEY'RE
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD

02:03:57.196 --> 02:04:00.199

COLLEAGUE STATED TWENTY FIVE
PERCENT MUST BE AFFORDABLE LOW

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:36.969
INCOME HOUSING AND ALSO FIFTY
PERCENT AT LEAST HAS TO REMAIN

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:41.674
AN OPEN SPACE -- LIKE A PARK
SOMETHING SIMILAR OF COURSES

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:44.677

IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THOSE

INTO CONSIDERATION I JUST --
I AM HOPING THAT -- THIS WON'T

THEN PUSH THE RESPONSIBILITY
ON OTHER CITIES -- BECAUSE

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:44.549
WE KNOW WHEN WE MENTION RINA
EVERYBODY FALLS APART BUT

02:23:44.615 --> 02:23:50.621

CONCERN BUT I DEFINITELY TAKE

FIRST ONE EXPRESS OUR
APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR THE

02:29:25.323 --> 02:29:29.226
STAFF -- MORE IMPORTANTLY TO
THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- OF FOR

02:29:29.293 --> 02:29:32.029
WORKING WITH US IN IN MEETING
WITH US AND TALKING ABOUT

02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:34.699
SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE
WITH THE BILL WE DO THINK THE

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:38.102
AMENDMENTS IMPROVE THE BILL AND
START TO MOVE IT IN THE RIGHT

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:42.306
DIRECTION ONE OF THINGS WE WANT
TO BRING -- TO THE COMMITTEE'S

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:46.010
ATTENTION AND OTHERS IS A
COUPLE DIFFERENT ISSUES FIRST

02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:49.647
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL BUYS INTO
A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

02:29:49.714 --> 02:29:53.718
THEY'RE PRESENTED WITH THE
CCN OURS THEY'RE SIGNING THE

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:56.320
CCN OURS IS IF THAT THEY'VE
READ THEM AND THAT THEY'VE

02:29:56.387 --> 02:30:01.225
UNDERSTOOD THEM WHEN WE MAKE
CHANGES IN THE CIVIL CODE THAT

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:05.763
BASICALLY SAY THAT ACC ARE IS
NO LONGER ENFORCEABLE WE ARE

02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:09.033
CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME
WE'RE CHANGING THOSE CONTRACT

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:13.170
TERMS THAT EVERYBODY IN THE
ASSOCIATION HAS SIGNED INTO

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:18.209
THERE ARE EXISTING PRACTICES
TO CHANGE CC IN OURS AND

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.911
WE'D BE HAPPY TO GET INTO A
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW SOME OF

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:24.515
THOSE PRACTICES CAN BE IMPROVED
BECAUSE MANY TIMES WE CAN SEE

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:27.385
THAT ASSOCIATION IS UNABLE TO
CHANGE THE CCN OURS BECAUSE

02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:30.054
OF SOME OF THE EXISTING RULES
THERE BUT I ASKED YOU ON

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:33.891
SOMETHING LIKE A ROOMMATE AND
I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS THAT

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:37.395
WERE MADE EARLIER BUT THINK
ABOUT THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE

02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:41.999
OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT ALSO OWN
IN THAT ASSOCIATION THE OTHER

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:46.303
ELEMENT THAT WE WANT TO BRING
UP IS THE COST ANYTIME WE ADD

02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:50.841
COSTS TO AN ASSOCIATION THOSE
TRICKLE DOWN TO HOMEOWNERS

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:53.711
IT'S THE HOMEOWNERS THAT PAY
THE MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS AND

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:57.448
ACTUALLY THEN COVER THE BUDGET
FOR THOSE ASSOCIATIONS AND

02:30:57.515 --> 02:31:00.718
SO AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK
ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:03.554
WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT THAT
WE BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:07.425
THAT CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS
WILL BE THAT ANSWER OR ONE OF

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:10.461
THE ANSWERS THAT WE FIND IN
CALIFORNIA FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE

02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:13.531
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OWNERSHIP

02:31:13.798 --> 02:31:16.801
WE NEED TO BE WARY OF THE NEW
WOULD ISSHIN FOR RESTRICTIONS

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:19.937
WE PLACE ON ASSOCIATIONS
THAT ULTIMATELY RAISE THEIR

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:23.641
COSTS AND THEN END UP IN NEW
ASSESSMENT SO WE LOOK FORWARD

02:31:23.707 --> 02:31:26.076
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE
AUTHOR WE THINK THAT THE BILL

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.813
STILL NEEDS SOME CLEAN UP
THERE SOME TECH TERMINOLOGY

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:31.382
IN THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE
DEALT WITH WE'LL BE WORKING

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:34.218

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:02.433
HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS
FOR THE MISTER SARATOGA THANK

02:34:02.499 --> 02:34:06.403
YOU VERY MUCH I UNDERSTAND
THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH HOAS

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:08.839
-- AND THAT'S WHY I CHOOSE
NOT TO LIVE IN AN H.

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:13.444
AWAY -- GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHY

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:17.314
PEOPLE DO LIVE IN THEM AND
THEY LIVE IN THEM BECAUSE --

02:34:17.381 --> 02:34:23.120
THEY WANT A MORE RESTRICTIVE
-- BODY THAT GOVERNS THEIR

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:27.224
COMMUNITY AND IT MAINTAINS
A CERTAIN STANDARD FOR THAT

02:34:27.291 --> 02:34:36.600
COMMUNITY I REALLY HESITATE TO
TRY TO IMPOSE LESS RESTRICTIONS

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:39.336
ON THOSE EIGHT ARE MORE
RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT HOAS CAN

02:34:39.403 --> 02:34:46.343
ACCOMPLISH THE YEARLY STRUGGLE
FOR THEM TO GET SOMEBODY

02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:51.348
ANYBODY TO SERVE ON THE BOARD
IS ONE MOST THANKLESS JOBS

02:34:51.415 --> 02:34:57.121
EVER -- IS IS HOW IT'S ALREADY
DIFFICULT -- AND TELLING THEM

02:34:57.187 --> 02:35:00.524
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO HAVE
TO TAKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEN

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:03.994
THE COURSES THAT WE ALL HAVE
TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO BE AN

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:10.100
IN PUBLIC SERVICE -- IT WILL
CAN PRETTY MUCH IN THAT -- AND

02:35:10.167 --> 02:35:11.268
YOU'LL WIND UP WITH AN H.

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:17.408
AWAY GOVERNED BY THE COMMUNITY
DIRECTOR I GUESS -- SO

02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:21.378
THAT KIND OF ELIMINATES
THE THE MECHANISM THAT THEY

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:25.883
HAVE -- TO ADDRESS THEIR
GRIPES WITHIN THE H.

02:35:25.949 --> 02:35:30.754
AWAY THERE'S A PROCESS IT
EXISTS PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE YOU

02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:34.358
CAN YOU TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY
LIKE THAT OR NOT AND -- AND I

02:35:34.425 --> 02:35:36.960
THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO THEM
TO DECIDE THAT IF THEY DON'T

02:35:37.027 --> 02:35:40.764
WANT TO THEN THEY SHOULDN'T --
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T MOVE INTO

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:44.802
IT AND THEN ONE HAS TO FIX
IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING THE

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:49.006
WAY THEY WANT AND I SYMPATHIZE
WITH THIS POOR GENTLEMAN THAT

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:55.012
CALLED AND NOW WITH HIS ISSUES
THERE -- BUT -- YEAH HARD FOR

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:58.048
ME TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE OF
THAT I JUST DON'T LIKE TO DELVE

02:35:58.115 --> 02:36:02.720
INTO HOAS AND -- AND YOU KNOW
THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON

02:36:02.786 --> 02:36:06.023
WHEN PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE
JIM FOR A REASON AND -- I

02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:08.625
DON'T THINK IT'S OUR PLACE
TO -- TO GO IN AND TELL THEM

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:11.195
THEY CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:14.965

THERE ARE SOME GOOD CHOICES

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:41.091

AND THINGS WHEN IT COMES TO
HARASSMENT AND AT THE TRAINING

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:46.697
I THINK IT'S A WIN WIN FOR
EVERYBODY NOBODY LIKES CHANGE

02:36:46.764 --> 02:36:49.767

THIS BUILDING TO ADVOCATE FOR
